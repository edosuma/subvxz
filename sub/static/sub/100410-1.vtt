01:43.645 --> 01:45.005
TWO GUNSHOTS

01:45.045 --> 01:46.765
CROWS CAW

02:48.925 --> 02:51.325
We may need you
to provide a statement, OK?

02:51.365 --> 02:52.365
Sure.

02:54.445 --> 02:57.885
Kenny, when did they start
building houses out here?

02:57.925 --> 03:00.445
Oh, a good ten years ago now, ma'am.

03:01.445 --> 03:03.605
So, what have we got?
Freddie Gill.

03:03.645 --> 03:06.125
Owner of the house.
He was shot. Twice.

03:08.805 --> 03:11.525
What's with the heavy mob?
Oh, bailiffs, ma'am.

03:11.565 --> 03:14.925
They showed up at six this morning
to repossess the property.

03:14.965 --> 03:16.205
Right.

03:17.645 --> 03:19.805
Is this the deceased's vehicle?

03:19.845 --> 03:21.045
It is.

03:21.085 --> 03:23.245
I could see you in one of those.
SHE SCOFFS

03:23.285 --> 03:25.165
I wouldn't drive that if you paid me.

03:32.365 --> 03:34.125
Morning, Malcolm.
Mm.

03:34.165 --> 03:35.965
Are you sure
you've got enough lights?

03:36.005 --> 03:39.645
Well, the lighting is poor and
the property doesn't have any power.

03:39.685 --> 03:41.965
The electricity was cut off
last week.

03:43.845 --> 03:45.965
So, what can you tell us?

03:46.005 --> 03:47.885
He's been dead for 12 hours.

03:47.925 --> 03:49.245
Maybe slightly less.

03:49.285 --> 03:51.765
The victim's been shot twice
in the chest.

03:51.805 --> 03:54.565
We recovered
two nine-millimetre casings.

03:54.605 --> 03:57.765
Likely fired from a handgun.We're
still searching for the weapon.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.205
Mm.

03:59.245 --> 04:02.845
The diameters of both
the entry wounds are fairly tight.

04:02.885 --> 04:06.005
So, I would suggest the shooter
was no more than six feet away

04:06.045 --> 04:07.685
when the gun was fired.

04:07.725 --> 04:10.605
Roughly where DS Healy
is standing now.

04:10.645 --> 04:12.245
So, up close and personal.

04:12.285 --> 04:13.565
Indeed.

04:14.885 --> 04:17.204
Any witnesses?
I've got a next-door neighbour.

04:17.485 --> 04:19.204
She says she was home all night,

04:19.245 --> 04:21.805
but swears
she didn't see or hear anything.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.005
What?

04:23.045 --> 04:24.445
Didn't hear two gunshots?

04:25.845 --> 04:28.445
Is that his bag?
Most likely.

04:28.485 --> 04:31.285
There's a monogram on the inside.
Initials FG.

04:31.325 --> 04:33.925
And was it open when you found it?
Mm-hm.

04:46.925 --> 04:49.045
He was obviously going somewhere.

04:49.085 --> 04:52.005
Or coming back from somewhere.
The boxers are clean.

04:52.045 --> 04:54.645
The shirts are pressed.
He was going.

04:54.685 --> 04:56.805
So, we need to find out where to.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.725
So, how did they get in?

04:59.765 --> 05:01.685
The bailiffs found
the front door open.

05:01.725 --> 05:04.045
It could be our man
let his killer in.

05:04.085 --> 05:07.165
But Forensics, they found a window
open in the ground floor bedroom.

05:15.885 --> 05:20.205
Anything?
Prints on the outside of the glass.

05:20.245 --> 05:23.285
Well, they're not
the window cleaner's, are they?

05:23.325 --> 05:25.805
Mm, it could be the access point.

05:25.845 --> 05:27.125
So, are we thinking burglary?

05:27.165 --> 05:28.845
Don't know.
No, it's doubtful.

05:28.885 --> 05:31.645
Still had a wad of cash on him and
a brand-new sports car in the drive.

05:31.685 --> 05:34.805
And yet he's not paying
his mortgage or his leccy bill.

05:36.405 --> 05:39.765
Whose room's this?
We think Gill's son. Riley Gill.

05:39.805 --> 05:41.165
According to the neighbour,

05:41.205 --> 05:43.485
Riley and his mum Jade
moved out about eight months ago.

05:43.525 --> 05:45.445
We're still trying to trace them.

05:45.485 --> 05:47.325
Right, well, let's make that
a priority.

05:55.845 --> 05:57.485
What did he do for a living?

05:57.525 --> 06:00.125
A bit of an entrepreneur,
by the looks of it.

06:00.165 --> 06:03.525
His main interest
was a used-car garage in the city.

06:03.565 --> 06:06.005
He owned it with a partner,
Nasir Ali.

06:09.165 --> 06:11.405
Excuse me, have you touched that?

06:11.445 --> 06:14.045
The sun visor.
No, ma'am.

06:14.085 --> 06:17.085
What is it?
Well, it's been pulled down...

06:17.125 --> 06:19.405
..and the mirror flipped open.

06:23.605 --> 06:25.725
Maybe he had a passenger.

06:25.765 --> 06:27.125
Probably a woman.

06:28.125 --> 06:29.565
Why probably a woman?

06:29.605 --> 06:30.925
It's a vanity mirror.

06:32.765 --> 06:34.925
What, only women are vain,
is that it?

06:34.965 --> 06:36.925
No.
But normally they use them...

06:40.405 --> 06:42.245
You're right.
It could be a man.

06:42.285 --> 06:44.125
Nah.
Probably a woman.

06:45.365 --> 06:47.565
The question is, where is she now?

06:49.445 --> 06:50.485
Hm.

06:50.525 --> 06:51.565
Right...

06:51.605 --> 06:54.285
Let's go and see Nasir Ali.

07:08.805 --> 07:10.645
That looks like
it's done a few miles.

07:11.725 --> 07:13.045
Looking to trade her in?

07:13.085 --> 07:15.605
Oh, we're not here to buy, sir.

07:15.645 --> 07:17.205
Or sell.

07:19.405 --> 07:22.085
DCI Vera Stanhope.
This is DS Healy.

07:22.125 --> 07:24.005
We're looking for Nasir Ali.

07:24.045 --> 07:26.005
That's me.
Is there a problem?

07:26.045 --> 07:28.205
Right, well,
you could say that, love.

07:28.245 --> 07:29.565
Can we go inside?

07:29.605 --> 07:31.245
Of course.

07:31.285 --> 07:32.445
Follow me.

07:34.685 --> 07:36.285
It's unbelievable.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.005
I mean, why would anyone...?

07:38.045 --> 07:39.765
He was such a good bloke.

07:40.925 --> 07:42.645
When did you last see him?

07:43.805 --> 07:45.245
A few days ago, maybe.

07:46.405 --> 07:49.165
And how did he seem?
He seemed in good form.

07:49.205 --> 07:51.405
He wasn't worried or anxious?

07:51.445 --> 07:52.965
Freddie? No.

07:53.005 --> 07:55.405
I never saw him worried
in all the time that I've known him.

07:55.445 --> 07:57.205
And how long have you known him?

07:57.245 --> 07:59.045
About six years.

07:59.085 --> 08:01.805
Although, it's me who's in charge
of running the operation.

08:04.445 --> 08:07.645
Had he been in
any kind of trouble lately?

08:08.805 --> 08:11.645
What kind of trouble?
Well, the sort of trouble

08:11.685 --> 08:14.725
that gets you killed
in your own home, Mr Ali.

08:14.765 --> 08:16.325
No.
Nothing like that.

08:16.365 --> 08:19.005
He was just a businessman.
Everyone liked him.

08:19.045 --> 08:21.045
Well, clearly, not everyone.

08:22.045 --> 08:24.165
Did you know he was losing his house?

08:24.205 --> 08:26.045
He was being evicted this morning.

08:26.085 --> 08:27.725
No.

08:30.365 --> 08:33.965
But business here is good, is it?

08:34.005 --> 08:35.765
Aye, we're ticking over.

08:36.765 --> 08:39.924
So, he'd have had some money
coming in, if you're ticking over.

08:39.965 --> 08:41.085
Of course.

08:41.125 --> 08:43.684
What about family?
He had a wife.

08:43.725 --> 08:46.365
Jade. But they've been separated
a while now.

08:47.365 --> 08:49.965
She and the son Riley
had moved out.

08:50.005 --> 08:51.805
She came by yesterday.

08:53.085 --> 08:54.565
Jade did.

08:54.605 --> 08:56.565
His wife was here?

08:57.725 --> 08:59.285
She was looking for him.

09:00.485 --> 09:02.165
Why was she looking for him?

09:03.165 --> 09:04.405
I'm sorry.

09:04.445 --> 09:05.605
No idea.

09:08.165 --> 09:10.685
Well, thanks very much, Mr Ali.

09:26.965 --> 09:28.885
Well, if this is
the business ticking over,

09:28.925 --> 09:30.925
I should hate to see it
when it's struggling.

09:30.965 --> 09:32.565
Do you think we should check
the books?

09:32.605 --> 09:33.805
Aye.
TEXT MESSAGE ALERT

09:33.845 --> 09:35.765
Let's see what the real story is.

09:35.805 --> 09:37.445
Jac's traced the wife.

09:37.485 --> 09:39.965
She and the son are living
with her family, the Tripps.

09:40.005 --> 09:41.445
Where?

09:41.485 --> 09:43.365
They run the pub
on the road to Osterhead.

09:43.405 --> 09:44.645
I know it.

09:45.645 --> 09:47.525
Right.
ENGINE STARTS

10:02.125 --> 10:03.845
The pub's closed this morning.

10:03.885 --> 10:06.005
Arthur's friends and family only.

10:07.365 --> 10:10.045
Ah, well, we're sorry to intrude,

10:10.085 --> 10:12.245
but I need to talk to Jade Gill.

10:12.285 --> 10:14.765
Is this important?
It's just, er...

10:15.845 --> 10:17.205
..we buried her dad today, so...

10:18.005 --> 10:20.325
What's your name, love?
Darren Tripp.

10:20.365 --> 10:21.725
Arthur was me brother.

10:22.805 --> 10:24.245
I'm Jade's uncle.

10:26.405 --> 10:29.365
Well, I'm sorry for your loss,
Mr Tripp.

10:29.405 --> 10:31.005
But this can't wait.

10:46.605 --> 10:48.965
Mrs Gill?
Yeah. What do you want?

10:49.965 --> 10:52.125
Is there somewhere quiet
we can talk, love?

10:52.165 --> 10:53.685
Yeah, through here.

10:57.445 --> 10:59.765
It's the police talking to our Jade.

11:00.765 --> 11:02.125
When did this happen?

11:03.405 --> 11:05.925
Well, sometime last night, we think.

11:14.885 --> 11:17.165
Now, in order to find out
who did this,

11:17.205 --> 11:19.005
I need to ask you some questions.

11:20.605 --> 11:25.765
Now, can you think of any enemies
your husband might have had?

11:25.805 --> 11:28.045
I can think of plenty.

11:28.085 --> 11:31.405
Obviously, I don't mean anyone who'd
kill him, like. I just meant...

11:34.525 --> 11:36.685
Freddie had a reputation.

11:38.005 --> 11:40.165
A bit of shark,
when it came to business.

11:41.525 --> 11:43.325
He liked getting one over on folk.

11:44.525 --> 11:46.965
Anyone in particular?
No.

11:48.085 --> 11:49.645
Freddie wasn't fussy.

11:50.725 --> 11:52.445
When did you last talk to him?

11:52.485 --> 11:54.165
A few weeks ago.

11:54.205 --> 11:56.525
We broke up in October last year.

11:56.565 --> 11:58.805
We've barely spoken since.

11:58.845 --> 12:02.085
But you were looking for him
yesterday.What?

12:02.125 --> 12:04.325
Nasir Ali said
you turned up at the garage,

12:04.365 --> 12:06.125
looking to talk to Freddie.

12:06.165 --> 12:07.365
Yeah.

12:08.365 --> 12:10.285
But I didn't find him.

12:10.325 --> 12:12.645
Why did you need to see him?

12:14.005 --> 12:16.725
I wanted to make sure
he didn't come to Dad's funeral.

12:16.765 --> 12:18.765
I didn't want him upsetting Riley.

12:18.805 --> 12:20.685
Riley being his son?

12:20.725 --> 12:22.845
Technically, yes.

12:23.965 --> 12:25.965
But Freddie never showed
much interest in him.

12:27.085 --> 12:29.245
Jade, dear,
you're needed back in here.

12:29.285 --> 12:31.165
We're supposed to be mourning
our dad.

12:31.205 --> 12:33.325
I'll be there in a minute, Mum.

12:35.165 --> 12:37.685
Mind telling us what's going on?
It's about Freddie.

12:38.685 --> 12:40.885
He's dead.
What do you mean, he's dead?

12:40.925 --> 12:43.645
I mean, he's dead.
Someone shot him.

12:45.245 --> 12:47.405
Riley, love...
I'll get him.

12:50.725 --> 12:52.965
Look, I know you've had a rough day,
Mrs Gill.

12:54.085 --> 12:55.645
But I have to ask...

12:56.765 --> 12:58.325
..where were you last night?

12:58.365 --> 12:59.605
She was with us.

12:59.645 --> 13:01.125
Her family.

13:02.125 --> 13:03.245
And where were you?

13:03.285 --> 13:06.485
My husband's body
went into the chapel last night.

13:06.525 --> 13:09.525
We were there
and then we all came back here.

13:10.965 --> 13:13.365
And can I ask, what time was that?

13:14.565 --> 13:16.365
The vigil finished at 6:30.

13:16.405 --> 13:19.405
We were back in the pub by 7:00.

13:19.445 --> 13:23.045
Now, there'll be time enough
to mark Freddie's death.

13:23.085 --> 13:26.445
But today,
we're here to celebrate my Arthur.

13:27.445 --> 13:29.965
A decent man.
And a loving father.

13:42.805 --> 13:44.085
Freddie Gill.

13:44.125 --> 13:46.005
49 years old.

13:46.045 --> 13:50.325
Found dead in his home on
the Morton Estate early this morning.

13:50.365 --> 13:53.405
Now, Forensics
are still processing the site,

13:53.445 --> 13:54.965
but they fast-tracked some prints

13:55.005 --> 13:56.845
found on the ground floor
bedroom window,

13:56.885 --> 14:00.165
but they don't match anything
on the system.

14:00.205 --> 14:01.605
So, all we know...

14:02.605 --> 14:04.365
..is that he died
from gunshot wounds.

14:04.405 --> 14:08.085
Likely a handgun, but we're waiting
on Ballistics to confirm.

14:08.125 --> 14:11.725
As to who killed him and why,
well...

14:12.725 --> 14:14.605
..we're in the dark.

14:14.645 --> 14:17.205
So, I'm going to need
everything about his life,

14:17.725 --> 14:19.645
right up to that shooting.

14:19.685 --> 14:22.725
Mark. Now, we know
he was being evicted this morning

14:22.765 --> 14:25.565
and we found his overnight bag
at the site.

14:25.605 --> 14:27.765
Find out where he was going.
Ma'am.

14:27.805 --> 14:31.205
Kenny. Now, it seems
he was a bit of a chancer,

14:31.245 --> 14:32.845
so maybe he made enemies.

14:32.885 --> 14:35.525
Go through his bank records.
Ma'am.

14:35.565 --> 14:38.045
I also want to look at his in-laws.
Hm?

14:38.085 --> 14:40.285
His estranged wife Jade

14:40.325 --> 14:42.445
and son Riley.

14:42.485 --> 14:43.965
And finally...

14:44.005 --> 14:47.725
..there may have been a passenger
in his car with him last night.

14:47.765 --> 14:50.765
Now, maybe whoever that was
saw what happened.

14:50.805 --> 14:52.445
Maybe they're the killer.

14:52.485 --> 14:54.365
Either way, we need to find 'em.

14:54.405 --> 14:57.245
I think we may already
have found them, ma'am.

14:57.285 --> 14:59.285
They've just unlocked Gill's phone.

14:59.325 --> 15:01.325
His last text
was to a Laura Whitelock.

15:01.365 --> 15:04.325
They arranged to meet last night.
Yeah, I told you it was a woman.

15:04.365 --> 15:06.285
Have we got an address?
I'm on it.

15:06.325 --> 15:08.445
Ma'am, that was Jac.

15:08.485 --> 15:11.685
SOCOs have found a third casing
outside of Gill's house.

15:13.205 --> 15:15.085
There's a bullet unaccounted for?

15:19.485 --> 15:21.885
The casing was found in the grass
over here.

15:23.165 --> 15:25.325
Identical to the other two.

15:25.365 --> 15:28.125
Right, so, where's the bullet?
Still looking.

15:28.165 --> 15:30.925
But we did find some blood traces
at the side of house.

15:35.925 --> 15:38.765
Well, it looks like, whoever it was,
was running.

15:40.125 --> 15:42.045
It could be our mystery passenger.

15:44.005 --> 15:45.285
Woods...

15:50.125 --> 15:52.605
Jac, as many bodies as you can find.

15:52.645 --> 15:54.925
Spread out and start searching.

16:11.005 --> 16:12.605
Over here!

16:14.005 --> 16:16.125
Hey, can you hear me?

16:16.165 --> 16:19.525
Tell me your name. I'm DS Healy
from Northumberland City Police.

16:19.565 --> 16:20.765
Ma'am!

16:20.805 --> 16:22.205
Ambulance! Now!

16:22.245 --> 16:23.925
It's, OK, we've got you.

16:23.965 --> 16:25.565
You're going to be all right.

16:34.004 --> 16:35.364
Are you ready?
Yeah.

16:35.404 --> 16:36.844
Can you hear me, love?

16:36.884 --> 16:38.364
Who did this to you?
Raise and lift.

16:39.484 --> 16:41.644
You're going be all right, pet.
It'll be all right.

16:41.684 --> 16:45.044
PARAMEDIC:
Female. Late 20s, early 30s.

16:45.084 --> 16:46.764
Gunshot wound to the lower left leg.

16:46.804 --> 16:48.284
Were on our way to ED.

16:48.324 --> 16:49.564
Lift.

16:57.764 --> 17:00.364
HELICOPTER ENGINE ROARS

17:00.404 --> 17:02.404
Right, Jac,
get over to the hospital.

17:02.724 --> 17:04.884
If she says anything,
I want to know.

17:04.924 --> 17:08.124
Kenny, get SOCOs into the woods.

17:08.164 --> 17:11.003
I want them to sift that ditch
for anything we might have missed.

17:12.324 --> 17:13.644
It is Laura Whitelock.

17:13.684 --> 17:16.404
She's 33 years old
and she lives in Sandyford.

17:16.444 --> 17:18.404
Aye, no doubt with her husband.
What?

17:18.444 --> 17:20.564
She was wearing a wedding ring.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.924
Shot?
Someone actually shot her?

17:29.964 --> 17:32.084
Your wife is alive, Mr Whitelock.

17:32.124 --> 17:34.604
And right now,
she's in very good hands.

17:34.644 --> 17:37.044
There's a patrol car on its way
to take you to the hospital.

17:37.084 --> 17:39.284
You might want to change first, pet.

17:40.924 --> 17:42.924
Why would anyone shoot Laura?

17:42.964 --> 17:45.724
Well, that's what we're going
to find out.

17:45.764 --> 17:48.684
Now, your wife
wasn't the only victim.

17:48.724 --> 17:50.564
Someone else was shot.

17:51.764 --> 17:53.884
Someone who died of their injuries.

17:53.924 --> 17:56.084
A Freddie Gill.
Do you know him?

17:56.124 --> 17:57.404
No.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.244
Your wife never mentioned him?
Never.

18:02.004 --> 18:05.844
Well, we think she may have been
with him last night at his house.

18:07.484 --> 18:10.404
Can you think of any reason
why she would have been with him?

18:10.444 --> 18:13.604
Well, I was worried when
she didn't come home last night.

18:13.644 --> 18:15.204
Aye, well, you would be.

18:15.244 --> 18:17.964
I just figured that she'd had an
emergency at work, had to stay on.

18:19.324 --> 18:21.964
What does she do?
She's a nurse.

18:22.004 --> 18:25.644
And she was working yesterday?Yeah,
picked up a shift at East Grove.

18:25.684 --> 18:27.644
That's a care home.

18:27.684 --> 18:30.084
So, where's this car, then?
It'll be here.

18:36.644 --> 18:39.244
Do you think he knew his wife
was having an affair with Gill?

18:39.284 --> 18:41.004
We don't know
they were having an affair.

18:41.044 --> 18:43.724
Let's not speculate
until we've talked to her,

18:43.764 --> 18:45.564
the second she's conscious.

18:47.564 --> 18:49.804
But, yeah, get Jac to check him out.

18:51.044 --> 18:53.484
Now, this care home, what was it?

18:54.564 --> 18:57.444
East Grove?
Yeah. It's a bit of a trek.

19:09.164 --> 19:10.524
Poor Laura.

19:11.524 --> 19:14.684
I can't believe it.
I was only talking to her yesterday.

19:14.724 --> 19:17.284
So, she was at work yesterday?

19:17.324 --> 19:19.044
Till about 6:00.

19:19.084 --> 19:20.964
How did she seem?

19:21.004 --> 19:22.364
Laura?

19:22.404 --> 19:23.844
Laura was fantastic.

19:23.884 --> 19:26.284
She's always fantastic.
She's a great nurse.

19:26.324 --> 19:28.164
We were lucky to get her.

19:28.204 --> 19:31.004
Why's that, then?
Normally, she works private.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.564
One-on-one clients.
Where the money is.

19:34.764 --> 19:38.484
But her most recent patient
passed away last week,

19:38.524 --> 19:40.524
so we managed to get her in
for a few shifts.

19:40.564 --> 19:43.324
Who was this recent patient?

19:43.364 --> 19:45.844
Er, an elderly gentleman, I think.

19:45.884 --> 19:48.084
Do you have a name?
No, sorry.

19:48.124 --> 19:51.244
But she did mention that he lived
in a pub, if that helps.

19:55.284 --> 19:56.764
Thanks very much, love.

19:58.804 --> 20:00.724
How long had she worked for you?

20:00.764 --> 20:02.404
We brought her in
about three months ago.

20:02.964 --> 20:04.444
When Dad started to get bad.

20:05.444 --> 20:07.404
Look, can you just leave that
for a minute, love?

20:07.444 --> 20:08.444
Hm?

20:10.364 --> 20:12.524
Now, did you have any problems
with her?

20:12.564 --> 20:13.844
She was all right.

20:13.884 --> 20:15.164
Dad liked her.

20:15.204 --> 20:16.564
What was she doing with Freddie?

20:17.684 --> 20:19.844
Well, I've not been able
to talk to her yet,

20:19.884 --> 20:21.364
but it seems they knew each other.

20:21.404 --> 20:24.404
Well, how did they know each other?
Take a guess, Mam.

20:25.444 --> 20:29.444
So, none of you were aware
that Laura knew Freddie?

20:29.484 --> 20:31.004
Well, of course not.

20:31.044 --> 20:34.044
If we had, you can bet your life
we'd have sacked her.

20:34.084 --> 20:35.924
It makes sense, though.

20:35.964 --> 20:38.124
Thinking on it now,
she was exactly Freddie's type.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.284
How was she his type?

20:41.324 --> 20:43.564
Well, she had a pulse, for a start.

20:43.604 --> 20:46.484
Ah, now, hang on, we don't know
they were in a relationship.

20:46.524 --> 20:48.164
No.

20:48.204 --> 20:50.764
But I know me husband.
Even when we were together,

20:50.804 --> 20:53.364
he was always chasing round
after someone else.

20:53.404 --> 20:56.244
Well, that can't have been easy
for you,

20:56.284 --> 20:58.444
sharing your husband
with other women.

20:58.484 --> 21:00.044
I got used to it.

21:08.444 --> 21:11.324
Don't you think she seemed
a bit casual?

21:11.364 --> 21:13.204
The wife, Jade.
Mm.

21:14.604 --> 21:16.724
Cos she didn't seem too fussed

21:16.764 --> 21:19.644
about her husband
being a serial cheat.

21:19.684 --> 21:22.364
Well, maybe it's like she said,
she got used to it.

21:24.204 --> 21:26.124
No-one gets used to it, Aiden.

21:39.524 --> 21:41.404
What's the story with the Tripps?

21:41.444 --> 21:43.124
Ordinary family.

21:43.164 --> 21:45.004
Well known in the local area.

21:46.204 --> 21:47.844
Er, well-liked, too.

21:48.884 --> 21:50.524
Arthur Tripp, in particular.

21:50.564 --> 21:52.084
A popular man.

21:52.124 --> 21:55.204
How did he die?
Er, cancer, as far as we're aware.

21:55.244 --> 21:56.284
Hm.

21:57.804 --> 22:00.124
Now, Laura Whitelock...

22:00.164 --> 22:03.124
We know she was with Freddie Gill
on the night he was murdered.

22:03.164 --> 22:04.804
But we don't know why.

22:05.804 --> 22:09.204
Now, his missus seems to think
they were having an affair.

22:09.244 --> 22:11.884
It seems he's got form,
when it comes to other women.

22:11.924 --> 22:15.124
But the question is this,
who was the target?

22:15.164 --> 22:16.444
Hm?

22:16.484 --> 22:18.644
I mean, we've been assuming
it was him

22:18.684 --> 22:20.444
and she was just collateral damage.

22:21.404 --> 22:24.084
But it could be the other way round.
My money's on Gill.

22:24.124 --> 22:25.924
Aye.
It's likely, isn't it?

22:25.964 --> 22:27.924
Given his reputation.

22:27.964 --> 22:30.884
Oh, look, where's Mark?
I'm starving!

22:30.924 --> 22:32.284
God knows.

22:32.324 --> 22:34.044
Right, Kenny...

22:34.084 --> 22:36.244
Finances.
What have we got?

22:37.124 --> 22:39.324
He had his fingers in lots of pies.

22:39.364 --> 22:42.044
I mean, apart from the garage, he
had a stake in a mobile phone shop,

22:42.084 --> 22:43.564
a software business.

22:43.604 --> 22:46.804
We're looking into this lawyer,
a Sean Forrest.

22:46.844 --> 22:49.604
His signature appears
on Gill's paperwork.

22:50.604 --> 22:51.764
Hm.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.924
Right, Kenny, I want to talk to him.

22:53.964 --> 22:56.124
What if they were both the target?

22:57.404 --> 23:00.444
If they were having an affair, then
Nathan Whitelock would have motive.

23:00.484 --> 23:02.404
What, jealous husband?

23:02.724 --> 23:04.524
Yeah, it's possible, but...

23:04.564 --> 23:06.844
According to his record,
Nathan Whitelock has form.

23:06.884 --> 23:08.644
Has he?

23:08.684 --> 23:11.284
He was charged with assault in 2012

23:11.324 --> 23:13.884
after he punched a Mark Brooks
in a club.

23:15.764 --> 23:18.844
It seems Brooks had been dancing
with Laura Whitelock at the time.

23:18.884 --> 23:21.884
Oh, we checked something else.
Laura's call history.

23:21.924 --> 23:24.844
Nathan Whitelock didn't try
to contact his wife once last night.

23:26.164 --> 23:27.524
Is that a fact?

23:27.564 --> 23:29.124
So much for him being worried.

23:30.244 --> 23:32.404
Get your coat.
He'll still be at the hospital.

23:37.644 --> 23:39.204
Oh...

23:39.244 --> 23:40.964
You're too late now.
What kept you?

23:41.004 --> 23:44.004
The usual place was closed, so I had
to go to the one on Blake Street.

23:44.044 --> 23:47.484
But then there was roadworks and...
Oh, just shut up. Give it here.

23:47.524 --> 23:50.244
MONITOR BEEPS STEADILY

24:01.884 --> 24:05.284
Where were you last night?

24:05.324 --> 24:06.684
I was at home.

24:06.724 --> 24:08.044
All night?

24:08.084 --> 24:09.444
All night.

24:09.484 --> 24:11.844
Worrying about Laura.
Yeah.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.524
Ah, now, you say that.

24:14.564 --> 24:16.684
But we've checked her phone record.

24:16.724 --> 24:19.444
It's odd you didn't try
to contact her last night.

24:19.484 --> 24:21.844
So, if you were that worried, why
didn't you try and call her

24:21.884 --> 24:23.124
to see if she was OK?

24:23.164 --> 24:24.444
Ah...

24:24.484 --> 24:25.964
Cos he didn't have to.

24:27.204 --> 24:30.164
Cos you already knew where she was.
Didn't you, love?

24:31.284 --> 24:33.964
Now, when we told you
Laura was with Freddie Gill,

24:34.004 --> 24:35.564
you said you didn't know him.

24:36.724 --> 24:38.564
But you didn't ask who he was.

24:38.604 --> 24:42.164
And you didn't ask
why she was with him.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.564
So, how long have you known?

24:46.604 --> 24:48.364
She kept denying it.

24:49.604 --> 24:52.604
Told me I was imagining things.
That I was paranoid.

24:52.644 --> 24:54.284
Ah, but you weren't paranoid,
were you?

24:54.324 --> 24:56.604
All I had to do was follow her
one night.

24:56.644 --> 24:59.404
She drove straight to his house.
Is that what you did last night?

25:02.204 --> 25:04.764
Did you go to his house last night,
love?

25:04.804 --> 25:06.764
Look, I wouldn't hurt anyone.

25:06.804 --> 25:08.364
No?
What about Mark Brooks?

25:08.404 --> 25:10.764
You thumped him for dancing with her.

25:10.804 --> 25:14.404
So, what would you do to the fella
who was sleeping with her?

25:14.444 --> 25:16.324
All right,
maybe I did want Gill dead.

25:16.364 --> 25:18.844
But I'd never hurt Laura.

25:21.564 --> 25:22.844
I love her.

25:24.364 --> 25:26.204
Despite everything.

25:29.244 --> 25:30.644
No way.

25:30.684 --> 25:33.204
She's out with another man
and he just sits home all night?

25:33.244 --> 25:35.204
Ah, it's hard
to get your head around.

25:35.244 --> 25:36.884
I reckon he's lying.

25:36.924 --> 25:39.244
I reckon he went round there
and shot them.

25:39.284 --> 25:43.644
Look, his assault conviction
means his prints are on the database.

25:43.684 --> 25:44.884
Right?
Mm.

25:44.924 --> 25:47.444
And they don't match those found
on the bedroom window.

25:47.484 --> 25:50.644
We don't know the killer used the
window. The front door was unlocked.

25:50.684 --> 25:53.004
Whitelock could've just walked in.
Aye.

25:54.084 --> 25:56.484
But then there's the small matter
of linking him to the gun.

25:56.524 --> 25:58.684
PHONE RINGS
The search team's over at his flat.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.124
We might get lucky.

26:00.164 --> 26:01.444
Oh, Mark.

26:02.484 --> 26:05.364
Oh, that was lovely fish, Mark.
Thank you.

26:07.964 --> 26:09.844
Right.
We're on our way.

26:09.884 --> 26:11.084
What?

26:11.124 --> 26:13.364
999 call from Nasir Ali.

26:14.724 --> 26:16.964
The garage is on fire.

26:32.004 --> 26:34.164
Please, stay back!
We're police officers.

26:35.564 --> 26:38.164
Where's the owner?We don't know
where he is at this time.

26:38.204 --> 26:39.444
Yeah, all right, love.

26:39.484 --> 26:40.964
Look, I can't let you through.

26:58.684 --> 27:00.164
Mr Ali?

27:02.044 --> 27:03.924
Mr Ali?
It's all right, love.

27:03.964 --> 27:05.164
Come on.

27:28.723 --> 27:31.923
Pretty extensive damage, ma'am.
Aye, I can see that.

27:31.963 --> 27:34.123
Well, the office has gone,
obviously.

27:34.163 --> 27:37.203
Six cars burnt-out.
All of the rest are smoke damaged.

27:37.243 --> 27:40.803
Yeah, whoever did this
meant business.

27:42.483 --> 27:45.403
What about CCTV?
The fire got to it.

27:47.603 --> 27:49.403
So, what else is around here?

27:49.443 --> 27:51.083
There's a few businesses, ma'am.

27:51.123 --> 27:53.123
There's a salvage yard,
a storage centre.

27:53.163 --> 27:55.283
Get over there, Mark.

27:55.323 --> 27:57.443
See if they've got any cameras.

27:57.483 --> 27:59.483
You never know,
we might find a witness or two.

27:59.523 --> 28:02.843
The hospital have sent Mr Ali home
about an hour ago.

28:02.883 --> 28:05.043
No life-threatening injuries,
thankfully,

28:05.083 --> 28:06.323
but he took a bit of a thumping.

28:06.363 --> 28:07.843
Oh, aye, he did.

28:07.883 --> 28:09.563
Right, come on, let's go and see him.

28:16.363 --> 28:18.843
I don't know who he was.
It was too dark.

28:20.123 --> 28:22.243
He had a hoodie, a scarf.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.923
I couldn't see his face.

28:25.963 --> 28:28.283
But you're sure it was a fella?

28:29.323 --> 28:31.323
What about height, build?

28:31.363 --> 28:33.043
Accent?

28:34.043 --> 28:36.003
Not so tall. Stocky.

28:36.043 --> 28:39.123
Erm... I can't remember anything
about his accent.

28:39.163 --> 28:41.403
What did he say to you?
Hey.

28:41.443 --> 28:43.563
My dad's the victim here.

28:43.603 --> 28:45.963
He's a good man.
A peaceful man.

28:46.003 --> 28:47.883
He doesn't deserve to be attacked
like this.

28:47.923 --> 28:49.403
Agrah, it's OK.
No.

28:49.443 --> 28:51.883
You're meant to get justice, Dad.
He's meant to get justice!

28:51.923 --> 28:53.923
Now, listen,
we're going to do everything we can

28:53.963 --> 28:55.883
to find out who did this to your dad.

28:55.923 --> 28:59.363
But we think the attack
might not have been random.

28:59.403 --> 29:01.923
So, I have to ask questions.

29:01.963 --> 29:03.643
I'm just doing me job, love.

29:04.883 --> 29:06.603
You should get going.

29:06.643 --> 29:08.803
I'm staying home today.
You've got exams.

29:09.883 --> 29:12.443
You need looking after.
Saddiq, go.

29:12.483 --> 29:14.043
Dad's right, get your arse to uni.

29:24.563 --> 29:26.083
He said he wanted the money.

29:27.083 --> 29:28.763
What money?

29:29.763 --> 29:31.363
Freddie's money.

29:31.403 --> 29:33.683
He said he owed him money
and now I owed it, too.

29:35.923 --> 29:38.723
I told them I couldn't pay,
I had nothing.

29:40.483 --> 29:42.683
That's when the beating started.

29:42.723 --> 29:46.923
So, had Freddie ever mentioned
owing anyone any money?

29:50.163 --> 29:52.883
A few months ago,
we were having cash flow problems.

29:52.923 --> 29:54.923
The bank wouldn't help us.

29:54.963 --> 29:57.723
But Freddie managed to find
the money we needed from somewhere.

29:57.763 --> 29:59.083
Well, did he say from where?

30:01.123 --> 30:02.803
How much did he borrow?

30:03.843 --> 30:05.403
70 grand.

30:07.283 --> 30:08.443
SHE WHISTLES

30:11.323 --> 30:14.043
I want to know where Freddie Gill
got that money.

30:14.083 --> 30:15.643
And 70 grand, that's a motive.

30:15.683 --> 30:17.683
Ah, Saddiq.

30:17.723 --> 30:19.123
SHE CHUCKLES

30:19.163 --> 30:22.003
These exams your taking,
they're important ones, are they?

30:22.043 --> 30:23.523
Finals.

30:23.563 --> 30:25.363
Now, what are you studying?

30:25.403 --> 30:26.803
Dentistry.

30:26.843 --> 30:28.563
There's a clever lad.

30:29.883 --> 30:32.083
So, er, what about your mam?

30:32.123 --> 30:34.683
Is she not around?
No, she left us.

30:35.963 --> 30:38.563
Last year.Ah, well,
I'm sorry to hear that, pet.

30:39.603 --> 30:40.923
It's no big loss.

30:41.923 --> 30:44.163
Just one more person
out to take advantage of my dad.

30:44.203 --> 30:46.043
What, like Freddie Gill?

30:49.163 --> 30:50.683
I'm going to be late.

30:56.963 --> 30:58.603
Right, listen up, everybody.

30:59.603 --> 31:03.203
Now, this attack on Mr Ali
and his business last night

31:03.243 --> 31:05.643
puts a whole new slant on the case.

31:05.683 --> 31:09.043
Because whoever was behind this
wasn't messing about.

31:09.083 --> 31:13.003
Now, Mr Ali said his assailant
asked for

31:13.043 --> 31:15.043
Money that Freddie Gill had borrowed.

31:15.083 --> 31:18.963
So, if this attack
and Freddie's murder are linked...

31:20.043 --> 31:22.763
..we might be looking at a case
of organised crime.

31:22.803 --> 31:26.723
Now, Kenny, Mr Ali said
Freddie borrowed 70 grand

31:26.763 --> 31:29.043
a few months ago.

31:29.083 --> 31:30.803
Have you got anything on that?

31:30.843 --> 31:33.603
Well, if he did, there's no sign
he put it into the garage.

31:33.643 --> 31:36.443
In fact, as far as I can make out,

31:36.483 --> 31:38.803
Gill was draining the business
of any money it had.

31:40.043 --> 31:42.323
Well, we've got to find out
where he got it from.

31:43.683 --> 31:46.283
What about this lawyer fella?
Sean Forrest.

31:46.323 --> 31:48.763
Mm. Have you managed
to make contact with him?

31:48.803 --> 31:51.803
According to his office, he's been
at home sick for the last few days.

31:51.843 --> 31:54.523
Yeah, well, find out his address.
We'll pay him a home visit.

31:54.563 --> 31:57.523
If we're linking last night
to the murder, we've got a problem.

31:57.563 --> 32:00.363
What?
Nathan Whitelock isn't our man.

32:00.403 --> 32:02.843
He was at the hospital
with Laura all night.

32:02.883 --> 32:05.043
And the search team,
they drew a blank at his house.

32:05.083 --> 32:06.843
Ah, well, I thought as much.

32:07.843 --> 32:10.763
OK, so we park Nathan for now.

32:11.923 --> 32:14.123
And we'll go see this lawyer fella.

32:23.843 --> 32:25.643
SHE KNOCKS

32:27.803 --> 32:29.963
Yeah, sorry about the mess.

32:31.923 --> 32:34.803
Your secretary told us
you'd been unwell.

32:34.843 --> 32:36.603
Yeah, a bit of a cold.

32:36.643 --> 32:38.803
I thought I'd stay here
and try and shake it off.

32:38.843 --> 32:40.083
HE SNIFFS

32:40.123 --> 32:41.683
Er, so you won't have heard, then?

32:42.723 --> 32:44.883
Heard what?
About Freddie Gill.

32:46.883 --> 32:50.683
Er, actually, I did hear about that.

32:50.723 --> 32:53.043
On the radio.
Bit of a shock.

32:55.203 --> 32:57.203
He was a good man.
I liked him.

32:58.403 --> 33:00.003
Have you got any idea who did it?

33:00.043 --> 33:03.403
Well, we were hoping
you could help us with that.

33:03.443 --> 33:04.603
Oh.

33:04.643 --> 33:05.803
OK. Why?

33:05.843 --> 33:07.723
Because he was your client.

33:07.763 --> 33:09.243
Er, no.

33:09.283 --> 33:10.683
Sorry, let's be clear.

33:10.723 --> 33:12.723
Freddie Gill never engaged me
as his lawyer.

33:12.763 --> 33:15.843
Yes, I knew him.
But we weren't close.

33:15.883 --> 33:18.443
But you were a named director
in two of his companies.

33:18.483 --> 33:21.283
Well, Freddie and I
did some business together.

33:22.283 --> 33:23.843
But we weren't friends.
OK?

33:26.803 --> 33:29.963
Well, one of the theories
we're working on

33:30.003 --> 33:33.923
is that he was killed
because of an unpaid debt.

33:33.963 --> 33:36.723
Apparently, he borrowed
a lot of money from someone.

33:37.763 --> 33:40.123
Do you have any idea
who that someone might be?

33:40.163 --> 33:41.843
No. Sorry.

33:41.883 --> 33:43.283
No?

33:43.323 --> 33:46.123
Well, whoever it was
wants their money back.

33:46.163 --> 33:48.003
And since they can't get it
from Gill,

33:48.043 --> 33:50.403
they're going after
his business associates.

33:51.523 --> 33:54.003
Gill's garage
was burned down last night

33:54.043 --> 33:56.923
and his business partner
was attacked.

33:56.963 --> 33:58.603
Nasir Ali.

34:00.763 --> 34:02.723
Are you all right there, Mr Forrest?

34:03.763 --> 34:04.963
Yeah.

34:05.003 --> 34:06.083
Yes.

34:06.123 --> 34:08.803
I'm just shocked.
You're shocked?

34:10.322 --> 34:12.603
Yeah, I had no idea Freddie mixed
with the sort of people

34:12.643 --> 34:14.922
who'd attack a man and his business
like that.

34:16.043 --> 34:17.603
Well, lesson learned.

34:17.643 --> 34:20.563
In future, I'll pick
my partners more carefully.

34:20.603 --> 34:21.963
Thank you.

34:25.842 --> 34:28.203
And where were you two nights ago?

34:28.243 --> 34:30.523
The night Freddie was shot.

34:30.563 --> 34:32.083
I have to ask.

34:32.123 --> 34:33.603
Two nights ago...

34:33.643 --> 34:35.243
Er, I left work about 6:00.

34:35.283 --> 34:36.922
I came straight home.

34:36.963 --> 34:38.643
I just watched TV
for the whole evening.

34:38.683 --> 34:40.283
Anyone with you?

34:41.283 --> 34:43.123
No.
I was on my own.

34:44.563 --> 34:46.882
Well, thanks for your time,
Mr Forrest.

34:48.763 --> 34:50.243
Er...

34:50.283 --> 34:51.963
We will talk again.

35:03.323 --> 35:05.883
I've got to admit, he's slick.
Well, I'll admit he's lying.

35:05.923 --> 35:09.803
Whatever Freddie Gill was doing,
he was involved, too.

35:09.843 --> 35:11.403
Up to his neck.

35:16.403 --> 35:18.003
PHONE RINGS

35:18.043 --> 35:20.443
Jac, anything on
the Ballistics report?

35:20.483 --> 35:22.323
End of the day, they promised.

35:22.363 --> 35:24.683
But Digital Forensics
got back to us.

35:24.723 --> 35:26.883
They've been through
Gill's search history

35:26.923 --> 35:28.163
and they flagged this.

35:29.683 --> 35:31.363
He was searching flights
to Barcelona

35:31.403 --> 35:32.723
three days before his death.

35:32.763 --> 35:35.323
Looking to leave next week.
Great, thank you.

35:35.363 --> 35:38.563
Ma'am, that was the hospital.
Laura Whitelock's fit to talk.

35:38.603 --> 35:40.483
Ah, at last!

35:42.643 --> 35:44.483
We'd been for a drive
down the coast.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.123
Freddie...

35:47.163 --> 35:49.083
..was taking me back home...

35:50.203 --> 35:52.843
..before booking into a hotel.

35:52.883 --> 35:54.523
He said he needed to...

35:55.523 --> 35:58.083
..drop in at the house
to pick up his overnight bag.

35:58.123 --> 35:59.923
And what time was that?

36:03.123 --> 36:05.603
I'm not sure.
Sometime around 10:00.

36:06.723 --> 36:08.923
He told me just to wait in the car.

36:10.003 --> 36:11.323
And he went inside.

36:14.563 --> 36:16.243
That's when I heard the bangs.

36:17.963 --> 36:21.123
And how long was he inside
before you heard the bangs?

36:22.163 --> 36:23.763
Not long.

36:23.803 --> 36:25.203
Five minutes maybe.

36:26.523 --> 36:28.923
I must've got out of the car.

36:28.963 --> 36:30.403
It was dark.

36:32.123 --> 36:33.963
I just started running.

36:35.043 --> 36:36.923
I ran round the side of the house.

36:39.083 --> 36:40.883
And there was another bang.

36:42.283 --> 36:44.123
And a pain in my leg.

36:45.923 --> 36:47.563
But I kept going.

36:49.123 --> 36:50.923
And then I was in the trees.

36:52.203 --> 36:53.843
And then, after that...

36:56.003 --> 36:57.603
..there's nothing.

36:59.883 --> 37:01.723
I'll get you a drink of water, pet.

37:06.203 --> 37:07.723
SHE SOBS QUIETLY

37:09.643 --> 37:12.083
There you are, love.
Thank you.

37:12.123 --> 37:13.683
How long had you known Freddie?

37:13.723 --> 37:16.323
We met about six weeks ago.

37:16.363 --> 37:18.723
A terminal patient of mine
asked me to find him.

37:18.763 --> 37:20.883
And which patient?

37:20.923 --> 37:22.643
His name was Arthur Tripp.

37:22.683 --> 37:24.883
And why did he want to see him?

37:26.123 --> 37:28.323
I think he just wanted
to see him again.

37:29.363 --> 37:30.523
I found Freddie...

37:32.043 --> 37:34.563
..and arranged for him
to meet Arthur.

37:34.603 --> 37:37.883
And Arthur's family
were OK with that, were they?

37:37.923 --> 37:39.883
You're joking?

37:39.923 --> 37:41.563
They had no idea.

37:41.603 --> 37:43.923
We had to sneak Freddie in one day
when they were out.

37:44.923 --> 37:47.563
We almost got away with it, but
then Arthur's son came home early.

37:50.683 --> 37:51.963
And what happened?

37:54.163 --> 37:56.483
Lee flipped.

37:57.523 --> 38:00.283
He started laying into Freddie.
He threw him out of the pub.

38:02.683 --> 38:04.843
HEALY:Just cos Lee
threw Freddie out of his pub

38:04.883 --> 38:07.563
doesn't make him a murderer.
STANHOPE: No, it doesn't.

38:07.603 --> 38:10.923
But I want to know why he didn't
bother to mention it before.

38:10.963 --> 38:12.363
Don't you?

38:19.723 --> 38:21.163
OK.

38:21.203 --> 38:22.603
So, I threw Freddie out.

38:22.643 --> 38:24.363
It's my pub.
I was within me rights.

38:24.403 --> 38:27.123
Ah, well, Laura Whitelock said
you did more than just throw him out.

38:28.163 --> 38:30.723
We might've exchanged a few blows.
Freddie got handy, did he?

38:31.723 --> 38:34.003
Look, he had no business
being in me dad's room.

38:34.043 --> 38:35.643
He knew he was in the wrong.

38:35.683 --> 38:38.883
Why didn't you mention this
when we spoke yesterday?

38:38.923 --> 38:41.083
I didn't want me mam to know.
Why not?

38:41.123 --> 38:43.443
She'd have been upset if she knew
Freddie was talking to Dad.

38:43.483 --> 38:46.123
Why would she be upset?
Because she hated Freddie's guts.

38:46.163 --> 38:47.563
But your dad liked him, right?

38:48.643 --> 38:50.083
Not especially.

38:50.123 --> 38:54.643
So, why did he ask Laura to track him
down and then get him to come visit?

38:54.683 --> 38:58.123
That didn't mean anything.Ah,
but it meant something to your dad.

38:58.163 --> 38:59.923
He insisted.

38:59.963 --> 39:02.803
He even asked Laura to sneak him in
while you lot were out.

39:02.843 --> 39:05.243
Look, Dad was ill.

39:06.283 --> 39:08.923
Do you understand?
He wasn't himself in the end.

39:08.963 --> 39:10.283
His mind had gone, gone to mush,

39:10.323 --> 39:12.203
cos of all the drugs
they'd pumped into him.

39:12.243 --> 39:13.723
So, whatever he said,

39:13.763 --> 39:16.483
whoever he asked for,
it meant bugger all.

39:24.683 --> 39:26.483
What are you thinking?

39:27.883 --> 39:30.203
I'm wondering why he was so angry.

39:30.243 --> 39:31.883
Well, Freddie Gill, for a start.

39:32.963 --> 39:36.083
Yeah, well, he obviously didn't like
the fella, but would he shoot him?

39:36.123 --> 39:38.803
And then there's the debt.
The attack on the garage.

39:38.843 --> 39:41.323
I mean, how does he fit in
to any of that?

39:42.323 --> 39:45.123
MUFFLED SHOUTING

39:48.323 --> 39:50.643
Riley, come back here!

39:53.443 --> 39:55.283
I wouldn't read too much into it.

39:56.443 --> 39:58.043
Riley's at a difficult age.

39:58.083 --> 40:01.243
Ah, well, he has lost his dad
and his grandad

40:01.283 --> 40:03.843
in the space of a week.
It can't be easy for him.

40:03.883 --> 40:04.923
Mm.

40:06.603 --> 40:07.883
Royal Marines.

40:07.923 --> 40:09.003
Aye.

40:10.203 --> 40:11.523
A lifetime ago.

40:12.523 --> 40:13.643
Still...

40:14.643 --> 40:16.323
..best decision I ever made,
joining up.

40:16.363 --> 40:18.883
Oh, what,
and now you're back here, hm?

40:20.123 --> 40:21.803
I came back to be with Arthur.

40:22.963 --> 40:24.683
I'm glad I got to spend some time
with him.

40:24.723 --> 40:26.683
Mm, he sounds like a popular fella.

40:27.923 --> 40:30.083
He was a friend to all.
Even Freddie Gill?

40:30.123 --> 40:31.643
HE CHUCKLES

40:31.683 --> 40:33.603
Arthur loved a character.

40:33.643 --> 40:35.603
And Freddie was certainly that.

40:35.643 --> 40:37.563
DISTANT SHOUTING

40:37.603 --> 40:39.803
Time to go play peacemaker.

40:48.283 --> 40:51.083
Get some background on the uncle,
Darren Tripp.

40:52.163 --> 40:54.763
See if you can find any connection
between him and Freddie Gill.

40:54.803 --> 40:56.523
Aside from the obvious.

40:58.683 --> 41:00.523
What are you doing here?

41:01.723 --> 41:04.003
Er, he's just delivered
the Ballistics report, ma'am.

41:04.043 --> 41:06.723
And to be honest, I've always been
curious to see where you worked.

41:06.763 --> 41:08.443
I have to say...

41:08.483 --> 41:10.323
..it is a little drab.

41:10.363 --> 41:12.523
Oh, says the fella
who works in a morgue.

41:12.563 --> 41:13.683
CHUCKLING

41:13.723 --> 41:15.523
So, they've identified the gun?

41:15.563 --> 41:17.763
Well, they've identified
the bullets.

41:17.803 --> 41:20.243
Which shows that the gun
used to kill Freddie Gill

41:20.283 --> 41:23.443
was also used in a fatal shooting
six years ago.

41:23.483 --> 41:24.763
What?

41:24.803 --> 41:26.643
In 2013, ma'am.

41:27.843 --> 41:31.443
Steven O'Neill was shot and killed
by William Belmont in Hull

41:31.483 --> 41:33.363
in a drugs deal gone wrong.

41:33.403 --> 41:36.243
So, what happened to the gun?
Never recovered.

41:36.283 --> 41:38.803
Belmont refused to tell anyone
what he did with it.

41:38.843 --> 41:41.803
Ah, but he might have told
the lawyer who represented him.

41:43.523 --> 41:44.763
Sean Forrest.

41:55.882 --> 41:57.722
BANGING ON DOOR

41:57.762 --> 41:59.922
Who is it?
It's the police! Open up!

42:01.282 --> 42:04.082
Mr Forrest, we have a warrant
to search these premises.

42:04.122 --> 42:05.602
You what?

42:05.642 --> 42:07.242
This is a joke.

42:07.282 --> 42:08.482
No.

42:09.602 --> 42:11.242
Hey! Hey! Hey!

42:12.402 --> 42:14.882
If you tell me what you're looking
for, I might be able to help.

42:14.922 --> 42:17.922
Save you destroying my house.
William Belmont.

42:17.962 --> 42:19.962
What about him?
He was your client.

42:20.002 --> 42:21.242
I represented him.

42:21.282 --> 42:23.442
Well, you didn't do a great job,
did you?

42:23.482 --> 42:25.202
He's doing 12 years in Pengate.

42:26.562 --> 42:28.442
Billy shot a man
in front of three witnesses.

42:28.482 --> 42:30.642
I'm a good lawyer,
but I'm not a miracle worker.

42:30.682 --> 42:33.162
Hm.
Why are you interested?

42:33.202 --> 42:35.802
Because the gun Belmont used
to kill O'Neill

42:35.842 --> 42:38.162
is the same gun
that killed Freddie Gill.

42:39.762 --> 42:42.362
Doesn't look too shocked, does he?
Well, why would I be?

42:42.402 --> 42:44.082
Two murders.

42:44.122 --> 42:45.522
One gun.

42:46.882 --> 42:49.122
And you're the only link
between them.

42:49.162 --> 42:51.002
I'm linked to a lot of weapons.

42:52.002 --> 42:53.442
I'm a criminal lawyer.

42:53.482 --> 42:55.282
Half the cases I take on
involve something.

42:55.322 --> 42:57.682
Guns, knives, baseball bats.

42:57.722 --> 43:00.282
I represented one client
who assaulted somebody with an iron.

43:00.322 --> 43:02.562
Oh, I'm not interested in irons, pet.

43:02.602 --> 43:04.362
I'm interested in Belmont's gun.

43:04.402 --> 43:07.802
You both know as well as I do that
handguns are always being moved on.

43:07.842 --> 43:10.682
The same weapon can be used in lots
of different, unconnected crimes.

43:10.722 --> 43:12.122
Who knows where it is now?

43:12.162 --> 43:15.202
But it's obviously ended up in the
hands of whoever shot Freddie Gill.

43:15.242 --> 43:17.042
Or you could've had it all along.

43:17.082 --> 43:19.282
I had no reason to kill Freddie.

43:19.322 --> 43:21.442
He was my business partner.

43:23.522 --> 43:26.082
You'd better not be lying to me, pet.

43:29.602 --> 43:31.242
Hey! Hey!
What about this lot?

43:31.282 --> 43:33.602
They'll be a bit quicker
if you made 'em a brew.

43:40.602 --> 43:42.522
He's a hard man to like.

43:42.562 --> 43:44.802
Well, unfortunately, he's right.

43:44.842 --> 43:46.682
We don't have a credible motive

43:46.722 --> 43:49.082
and we can't prove
he ever had Belmont's gun.

43:49.122 --> 43:50.682
The search team
might come up trumps.

43:50.722 --> 43:52.722
Well, he's not going to keep it
in the house, is he?

43:52.762 --> 43:54.762
He's not that stupid.
Cheers.

43:54.802 --> 43:57.122
Ma'am, Freddie Gill's debt...
What?

43:57.162 --> 44:00.122
Who'd he get the money from?I've got
a source who said it was Gillespie.

44:00.162 --> 44:02.922
Danny Gillespie...

44:20.642 --> 44:22.242
Oh, a crossword?

44:23.442 --> 44:26.482
I'd have thought you were more
of a sudoku fella, Danny,

44:26.522 --> 44:28.282
what with your head for figures.

44:28.322 --> 44:29.842
DCI Stanhope.

44:29.882 --> 44:31.722
Are you here to play?

44:31.762 --> 44:34.002
Well, that depends on you.

44:36.442 --> 44:38.602
Freddie Gill.
I don't know him.

44:38.642 --> 44:40.082
Of course you do, Danny.

44:40.122 --> 44:42.282
Shot in his own home
not three days ago.

44:42.322 --> 44:45.162
It was all over the press.
Ah, I must've missed that.

44:45.202 --> 44:48.442
Plus, he's the fella
who owed you £70,000.

44:48.482 --> 44:51.162
I run a snooker hall, DCI Stanhope.

44:51.202 --> 44:53.962
My business is leisure, not loans.
Nah.

44:54.002 --> 44:56.922
Yeah, you're one of the biggest
illegal money lenders

44:56.962 --> 44:58.962
in the North East, Danny.

44:59.002 --> 45:00.362
Well, that just isn't true.

45:00.402 --> 45:02.282
But even if it was...

45:03.402 --> 45:06.202
..I doubt I'd lend 70 grand
to somebody I didn't know.

45:06.242 --> 45:07.642
MAN:Everything OK, boss?

45:09.562 --> 45:10.882
Are you all right, lads?

45:11.882 --> 45:14.042
The night before last,
where were you?

45:15.922 --> 45:18.922
The question isn't that hard.
Why do you want to know?

45:18.962 --> 45:23.282
Because Gill's business partner
was attacked over the debt.

45:24.562 --> 45:27.922
They were both here that night.
You're vouching for them, are you?

45:29.402 --> 45:32.178
Only because it's the truth.

45:35.762 --> 45:37.762
Nice seeing you again, Danny.

45:42.362 --> 45:44.082
Danny Gillespie.

45:44.122 --> 45:47.762
He's 52 years old and he's what
I like to call

45:47.802 --> 45:49.922
Now, he's got a few legit businesses.

45:49.962 --> 45:52.802
But his main source of income
is from loan-sharking.

45:52.842 --> 45:55.882
What's his connection to Gill?
Gill owed him money.

45:55.922 --> 45:59.362
Yeah, well, that doesn't necessarily
mean he was involved in his murder.

45:59.402 --> 46:02.282
But he does know something.
He's just not telling us.

46:02.322 --> 46:04.882
Yeah, well, we need to persuade him
to loosen his tongue.

46:05.842 --> 46:07.282
Here's what I want, Aiden.

46:07.322 --> 46:09.002
Get on to uniform.

46:09.042 --> 46:10.802
I want two units.

46:10.842 --> 46:14.122
One outside that snooker hall.
And another outside his house.

46:14.162 --> 46:16.842
And I want them there 24 hours
and I want them visible.

46:16.882 --> 46:19.362
OK.
Isn't that harassment, ma'am?

46:19.402 --> 46:21.162
Well, technically, yes, Jac.

46:21.202 --> 46:23.362
But we don't have to use
the actual word.

46:23.402 --> 46:25.242
Right, now, the next one up

46:25.282 --> 46:27.842
is this lawyer, Sean Forrest.

46:27.882 --> 46:30.162
Now, we can link him
to the murder weapon

46:30.962 --> 46:33.362
through his association
with Belmont.

46:33.402 --> 46:35.762
So, check out his alibi.

46:35.802 --> 46:38.642
See if he was in the vicinity
of Freddie Gill's house

46:38.682 --> 46:40.402
on the night he was murdered.

46:40.442 --> 46:42.642
And what about Nasir Ali's attack?

46:42.682 --> 46:46.602
We pulled the CCTV footage from
the storage centre across the road,

46:46.642 --> 46:48.802
but the camera doesn't cover
the garage.

46:48.842 --> 46:50.802
It's not all bad news, though.

46:50.842 --> 46:52.642
We might have a witness.

46:52.682 --> 46:55.282
This fella reckons he saw a male
running away from the garage

46:55.322 --> 46:56.802
around the time of the attack.

46:56.842 --> 46:59.802
Said he saw him get into a car
and drive off.

46:59.842 --> 47:01.322
Good work, Mark.

47:01.362 --> 47:03.922
Did they give you the number plate?
Er, no.

47:05.042 --> 47:07.242
Did they give a description
of the car?Yes, ma'am.

47:07.282 --> 47:09.682
Right, well, get on to the traffic
cameras in the area.

47:09.722 --> 47:12.442
Ma'am, Gill's trip to Spain.

47:12.482 --> 47:14.882
We found an overseas number
in his call history.

47:14.922 --> 47:17.762
It turned out to be a number
for a hotel in Barcelona.

47:17.802 --> 47:20.882
We rang it and the booking manager
confirmed that Gill called last week

47:20.922 --> 47:22.482
about booking a twin room
for a month.

47:22.522 --> 47:24.842
She also said that he was asking...
Hang on.

47:24.882 --> 47:27.402
Hang on, a twin room?
Yeah.

47:27.442 --> 47:29.642
So, he wasn't going alone.

47:31.122 --> 47:33.042
Did she give you the name
of the other guest?

47:33.082 --> 47:34.602
No.

47:34.642 --> 47:37.962
Now, why would you book a twin room,
hm?

47:39.482 --> 47:40.762
I mean, she also said what?

47:40.802 --> 47:43.442
That he was asking about getting
tickets for a Barcelona game.

47:43.482 --> 47:45.042
Football?
Yeah.

47:47.482 --> 47:49.762
I know who he was booking those for.

48:06.682 --> 48:08.362
Get that down you.

48:09.562 --> 48:13.082
Yeah, he sounds like
he was quiet a character, your dad.

48:14.282 --> 48:16.002
You must miss him.

48:17.242 --> 48:18.962
He wasn't around enough to miss him.

48:19.002 --> 48:20.522
Ah, well, even so...

48:20.562 --> 48:22.162
..you must be hurting.

48:24.842 --> 48:26.762
He was a waste of space.

48:26.802 --> 48:28.722
You couldn't count on him
for anything.

48:28.762 --> 48:30.162
He was a liar, a cheat and a loser.

48:31.122 --> 48:32.602
Hm.

48:34.082 --> 48:36.202
And what did you think of him?

48:36.242 --> 48:37.402
Hm?

48:37.442 --> 48:40.362
I mean, that little speech there,
that's your mam talking, isn't it?

48:41.442 --> 48:42.842
So, what did you think of him?

48:44.202 --> 48:46.202
He was the only one who understood.

48:46.242 --> 48:48.042
Understood what?

48:48.082 --> 48:49.602
How hard it is.

48:50.722 --> 48:52.282
Living at the pub.

48:54.202 --> 48:55.842
What about Spain?

48:58.002 --> 48:59.522
Barcelona...

49:02.602 --> 49:05.202
It was just for a few weeks,
that's all.

49:05.242 --> 49:06.962
Just so I could get a break.

49:07.002 --> 49:09.522
And your mam was all right with that,
was she?

49:09.562 --> 49:11.002
It was a secret.

49:12.282 --> 49:14.802
Dad said he'd call her
when we got there and explain.

49:16.362 --> 49:18.842
She must've gone through my phone,

49:18.882 --> 49:21.362
read the texts between me and Dad.

49:21.402 --> 49:23.642
She went crazy.

49:23.682 --> 49:25.402
Shouting and crying.

49:26.762 --> 49:28.442
And when was this?

49:30.402 --> 49:32.962
After we saw Grandad's coffin
go into the church.

49:34.082 --> 49:35.282
Back at the pub.

49:35.322 --> 49:38.482
So that was the day your dad died.

49:40.242 --> 49:43.202
And what did your mam do, Riley?

49:44.322 --> 49:45.322
Hm?

49:47.002 --> 49:48.322
She went looking for him.

49:57.002 --> 50:00.082
Jade Gill was out looking for her
husband on the night he was killed.

50:00.122 --> 50:01.762
Ma'am this just came through.

50:01.802 --> 50:03.162
What?

50:03.202 --> 50:06.522
The search team at Forrest's house
found this envelope

50:06.562 --> 50:08.362
behind some books on his shelves.

50:08.402 --> 50:10.522
This flash drive was inside.

50:11.562 --> 50:14.162
LOUD DANCE MUSIC

50:14.202 --> 50:15.642
That's his front room.

50:18.682 --> 50:20.322
Come on, don't be a lightweight.

50:20.362 --> 50:22.122
Who's he talking to?

50:22.162 --> 50:24.282
Whoever's behind the camera.

50:28.682 --> 50:30.162
Drugs and escorts.
What a classy guy.

50:30.882 --> 50:32.802
Come on, have some of this, Freddie.

50:32.842 --> 50:34.122
Freddie?

50:35.722 --> 50:37.402
Get Forrest in here.

50:39.362 --> 50:42.562
LOUD DANCE MUSIC

50:42.602 --> 50:45.162
Come on, don't be a lightweight.

50:45.202 --> 50:47.602
Come on, have some of this, Freddie.

50:51.562 --> 50:53.202
DANCE MUSIC STOPS

50:53.242 --> 50:55.882
Now, then,
we found that flash drive...

50:55.922 --> 50:59.402
..hidden away in an envelope
addressed to you.

50:59.442 --> 51:02.802
Now, we haven't analysed
the handwriting yet, but...

51:02.842 --> 51:06.762
..I'm willing to bet it was
Freddie Gill who sent you that.

51:07.962 --> 51:10.802
Now, it might have been
a little souvenir.

51:10.842 --> 51:13.042
A memento of your night.

51:14.042 --> 51:15.482
Hm?

51:15.522 --> 51:18.282
But given the fact
you were taking cocaine,

51:18.322 --> 51:21.682
I'm more likely to think
it was a blackmailing video.

51:21.722 --> 51:25.122
We reckon there's enough on that
flash drive to get you disbarred.

51:25.162 --> 51:27.442
So, let's recap, shall we?

51:28.482 --> 51:31.162
You've a link to the gun
that killed Freddie Gill.

51:31.202 --> 51:33.482
You've no alibi
for the night that he died.

51:33.522 --> 51:36.362
And now this suggests
he was blackmailing you.

51:39.122 --> 51:40.322
OK.

51:41.522 --> 51:42.922
A month ago...

51:42.962 --> 51:45.482
..I told Freddie I wanted to take
my money out of the companies.

51:46.642 --> 51:49.082
I should've known Freddie
wouldn't let me quit that easy.

51:50.402 --> 51:51.922
That was our celebration night.

51:53.442 --> 51:55.642
Freddie made sure
to get me good and drunk.

51:55.682 --> 51:58.082
He brought the drugs.
He called the girls.

51:59.362 --> 52:01.882
And then, three days later,
that comes through the letterbox.

52:03.082 --> 52:04.562
It's very subtle.

52:08.602 --> 52:10.042
Why did you want out?

52:10.082 --> 52:11.802
Freddie overstretched himself.

52:11.842 --> 52:13.322
Look, er...

52:13.362 --> 52:15.362
..the businesses were failing...

52:16.682 --> 52:18.642
..and he was running out of cash.

52:20.362 --> 52:22.522
He'd started to run up debt
with the wrong people.

52:22.562 --> 52:25.322
Oh, people like Danny Gillespie?

52:25.362 --> 52:26.722
Hm?

52:29.002 --> 52:30.162
I'm not stupid.

52:30.642 --> 52:32.322
Gillespie didn't get
where he is today

52:32.362 --> 52:34.282
by letting people like Freddie
fleece him.

52:35.482 --> 52:37.242
So...
So what are you saying?

52:37.282 --> 52:39.482
That when I found out
that Freddie was dead,

52:39.522 --> 52:41.722
I thought Gillespie
had caught up with him.

52:43.442 --> 52:45.082
I thought maybe I was next.

52:46.642 --> 52:49.282
But then you showed up this morning
talking about Belmont's gun.

52:49.322 --> 52:50.682
And, er...

52:53.562 --> 52:55.282
Well, now I don't know
what to think.

52:59.482 --> 53:00.962
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

53:01.002 --> 53:02.282
OK.

53:03.602 --> 53:05.202
This is all I will say.

53:07.202 --> 53:09.002
The gun you say killed Freddie,

53:09.042 --> 53:11.802
the one my client used
to shoot O'Neil...

53:13.762 --> 53:16.522
..I saw that gun in Freddie's house.

53:21.882 --> 53:24.202
Freddie Gill had Belmont's gun?

53:24.242 --> 53:25.402
Oh, yeah.

53:26.802 --> 53:28.402
For over a year.

53:39.962 --> 53:41.962
Do you think that Forrest
gave Gill the gun?

53:42.002 --> 53:43.322
Well, of course he did.

53:43.362 --> 53:46.922
He obviously got it from Belmont
and then passed it on to Gill.

53:46.962 --> 53:48.162
But why not just say that?

53:48.202 --> 53:51.922
Because he's still hoping
to slither his way out of this mess.

53:53.202 --> 53:55.522
But if he is telling the truth...

53:55.562 --> 53:57.682
..our main line of inquiry is blown.

53:57.722 --> 54:00.202
Cos we've been assuming
this was a hit.

54:00.242 --> 54:03.002
He was killed by career criminals.

54:03.042 --> 54:04.322
Organised.

54:04.362 --> 54:08.282
But if that gun has been in his house
for the past year...

54:09.482 --> 54:12.202
..then anyone of this lot
could've got their hands on it.

54:12.242 --> 54:14.002
Maybe one of them found it
at the house

54:14.042 --> 54:15.802
or wrestled it off Gill
and shot him.

54:18.562 --> 54:21.802
Or they already knew it was there.

54:26.322 --> 54:30.162
Jade Gill was angry with Freddie
because he was sneaking Riley off.

54:31.282 --> 54:32.282
Hm?

54:33.362 --> 54:36.202
She was still living with Freddie
till eight months ago.

54:37.322 --> 54:38.802
So, it's quite possible.

54:38.842 --> 54:40.562
She would have known about the gun.

54:42.722 --> 54:43.962
Mm.

55:02.042 --> 55:04.682
Jade Gill,
you'll need to come with us.

55:06.362 --> 55:07.882
I'm sorry, Mam.

55:07.922 --> 55:09.202
Riley?

55:10.362 --> 55:12.162
What the hell did you do?

55:22.581 --> 55:25.581
I told you I went out
looking for Freddie that day

55:25.621 --> 55:28.541
to make sure he stayed away
from Dad's funeral.

55:28.581 --> 55:32.461
And what about later, when you and
the family got back from the chapel?

55:32.501 --> 55:34.141
We all went back to the pub.

55:34.181 --> 55:37.261
Where you and Riley argued about
him going to Spain with his dad.

55:37.301 --> 55:39.461
What?
No, that's not true.

55:39.501 --> 55:41.221
You and Riley didn't argue?

55:42.501 --> 55:44.181
We did.

55:44.221 --> 55:46.421
But only because Spain
was never gonna happen.

55:46.461 --> 55:48.901
Freddie was just stringing
him along, as usual.

55:48.941 --> 55:51.621
No, he was going through with it,
love.

55:51.661 --> 55:53.301
They'd been planning it for weeks.

55:53.341 --> 55:56.181
Behind your back.
That must've rankled.

55:57.421 --> 56:00.341
So, tell us about Freddie's gun.

56:01.301 --> 56:03.941
What gun?
The one that was at the house.

56:03.981 --> 56:06.181
I don't know anything about that.

56:06.221 --> 56:07.301
No?

56:07.341 --> 56:09.461
Or maybe Riley knew about it.

56:12.981 --> 56:14.061
OK, fine.

56:14.661 --> 56:16.541
Freddie had a gun.

56:17.821 --> 56:20.541
I didn't like it being in the house,
but he kept it hidden from Riley.

56:20.581 --> 56:22.101
Where did he keep it?

56:22.141 --> 56:24.061
He had a bag.

56:24.101 --> 56:26.341
He called it his get-away pack.

56:26.381 --> 56:29.421
He kept the gun in it
and some clothes and some cash.

56:29.461 --> 56:33.221
So, a leather hold-all, monogrammed.
Is that the one?

56:33.261 --> 56:35.101
Yeah.

56:35.141 --> 56:37.261
But Riley knew nothing about it.

56:37.301 --> 56:38.821
But you did.

56:40.341 --> 56:43.941
And you were angry with Freddie,
cos he was taking Riley away.

56:43.981 --> 56:46.701
And you went out looking for him
to stop him.

56:46.741 --> 56:49.381
And you knew where that gun was.
No!

56:49.421 --> 56:51.341
Maybe you didn't mean to shoot him,
love.

56:51.381 --> 56:53.581
Maybe you just wanted to scare him.
That's not true!

56:53.621 --> 56:55.781
I understand.
You wanted to keep your son.

56:55.821 --> 56:57.261
I wanted to go with them!

57:00.821 --> 57:02.501
Yeah.

57:02.541 --> 57:04.661
I was angry with Freddie.

57:05.941 --> 57:08.461
But only because
he wasn't taking me.

57:14.301 --> 57:15.981
He called my bluff.

57:17.781 --> 57:19.901
When I walked out, I thought...

57:20.941 --> 57:23.301
This'll show him.

57:23.341 --> 57:25.981
This'll make him change.

57:26.021 --> 57:28.181
Give him a couple of months,
he'll come crawling.

57:30.341 --> 57:31.821
But he never did.

57:38.261 --> 57:40.661
The last time I saw him
was two weeks ago.

57:42.301 --> 57:44.501
So, you went out looking for Freddie.

57:45.981 --> 57:49.981
Yet your mam says
you were all together at the pub.

57:50.021 --> 57:52.261
I don't know why she said that.

57:52.301 --> 57:54.301
She probably thought
she was protecting us.

57:54.341 --> 57:56.341
But you went out.

57:56.381 --> 57:58.501
I went to the house.

57:58.541 --> 58:00.781
But when I got there,
Freddie wasn't in.

58:00.821 --> 58:02.821
I waited for a while
and then I went home.

58:04.021 --> 58:05.421
What time was this?

58:05.461 --> 58:06.981
About 8:00.

58:07.021 --> 58:08.941
Where did you go after?

58:10.741 --> 58:13.221
Back to the pub.
I got drunk.

58:13.261 --> 58:15.494
And who was there?

58:17.141 --> 58:18.661
Just Riley.

58:26.541 --> 58:30.061
Jade Gill says
she got to Freddie's house at 8:00

58:30.101 --> 58:32.101
and claims she didn't see him.

58:33.221 --> 58:34.781
And I'm inclined to believe her.

58:34.821 --> 58:36.581
Kenny, ANPR?

58:37.581 --> 58:40.181
They picked up Jade Gill's car
heading away from the crime scene

58:40.221 --> 58:41.901
just after 8:00, ma'am.

58:43.221 --> 58:45.381
So, we're back to square one.

58:45.421 --> 58:47.021
Where are you going?

58:47.061 --> 58:49.341
Er...I fancied a coffee.

58:49.381 --> 58:52.461
Yeah, well, that can wait, love.
Get on to the lab.

58:52.501 --> 58:56.101
Get them to fast-track the tests
on Gill's overnight bag.

58:56.141 --> 58:58.821
Apparently, our murder weapon
had been in it.

58:58.861 --> 59:00.181
Ma'am.

59:00.221 --> 59:02.581
And Tina Tripp's story

59:02.621 --> 59:05.901
that the family were at the pub
all night doesn't hold.

59:05.941 --> 59:09.621
Because Jade says only Riley
was there when she got home.

59:11.101 --> 59:13.501
Darren Tripp, what's his story?
I didn't find out much.

59:13.541 --> 59:16.021
Darren and Arthur bought the pub
in 1982.

59:16.061 --> 59:17.981
But Darren sold his share
to Arthur a year later

59:18.021 --> 59:19.021
when he joined the Navy.

59:19.061 --> 59:20.901
He came back last year
cos Arthur was dying.

59:20.941 --> 59:23.101
PHONE RINGS
What do you want to do about Jade?

59:23.141 --> 59:25.621
Well, we're going
to have to let her go. For now.

59:25.661 --> 59:27.061
DCI Stanhope.

59:31.181 --> 59:32.701
Where?

59:40.861 --> 59:43.461
Why are we meeting here?
What's wrong with here?

59:43.501 --> 59:45.181
Well, it's freezing, for a start.

59:45.221 --> 59:46.661
What is it you want?

59:46.701 --> 59:48.461
I want you to call off the dogs.

59:48.501 --> 59:50.861
Oh, come on, Danny.

59:50.901 --> 59:52.661
I'm not the Fraud Squad.

59:52.701 --> 59:54.861
I don't care how you make your money.

59:56.301 --> 59:58.501
I just want to know
what happened to Gill.

59:59.781 --> 01:00:02.701
I should never have lent him money.
So why did you?

01:00:02.741 --> 01:00:04.621
Because he talked a good game,

01:00:04.661 --> 01:00:07.941
because I didn't think he'd be
stupid enough not to pay me back.

01:00:07.981 --> 01:00:11.141
Ah, surprised you, did he?He didn't
even make the first payment.

01:00:13.661 --> 01:00:15.661
What do you know about his murder?

01:00:16.861 --> 01:00:19.221
I know it was nothing to do with me.

01:00:19.261 --> 01:00:21.421
Shooting people isn't my style.

01:00:21.461 --> 01:00:23.181
Ah, no.

01:00:23.221 --> 01:00:26.381
Beating up garage owners and
burning their premises to the ground,

01:00:26.421 --> 01:00:27.901
that's you style.

01:00:27.941 --> 01:00:29.101
See...

01:00:30.181 --> 01:00:31.901
..that's what's been bugging me.

01:00:33.101 --> 01:00:35.381
Gill's debt was paid back
a week ago.

01:00:35.421 --> 01:00:38.061
70 grand, plus interest.

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:40.221
SHE CHUCKLES

01:00:40.261 --> 01:00:42.381
Very funny.

01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:47.221
We've been through his accounts.
He wasn't in a position to do that.

01:00:47.261 --> 01:00:48.941
I didn't say Gill paid it.

01:00:59.741 --> 01:01:02.621
Are you saying
someone else settled the debt?

01:01:04.781 --> 01:01:06.901
Well, I'm going to need a name.

01:01:27.461 --> 01:01:29.061
Evening, Mrs Tripp.

01:01:30.341 --> 01:01:32.541
You've got some neck
showing up here.

01:01:34.581 --> 01:01:37.461
Dragging my daughter down to
the station, like a common criminal.

01:01:37.501 --> 01:01:39.221
Hardly dragged, Mrs Tripp.

01:01:40.541 --> 01:01:42.341
Danny Gillespie, do you know him?

01:01:42.381 --> 01:01:44.381
I know of him.
Who doesn't?

01:01:44.421 --> 01:01:48.981
Well, he told us
you gave him 70 grand last week.

01:01:50.021 --> 01:01:52.181
He said it was to settle
Freddie's debt.

01:01:52.221 --> 01:01:54.221
Well, he's mistaken.
Ah, no.

01:01:54.261 --> 01:01:57.061
Gillespie doesn't make mistakes
when it comes to money.

01:01:58.101 --> 01:01:59.661
So, I have to ask,

01:01:59.701 --> 01:02:02.101
since you didn't know Freddie
very well...

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:05.221
..why did you settle his debt?

01:02:07.621 --> 01:02:09.341
We're waiting for an answer.

01:02:14.581 --> 01:02:15.941
I asked him to.

01:02:16.941 --> 01:02:19.101
I paid Gillespie.
It was my money.

01:02:19.141 --> 01:02:21.261
And Darren just delivered it for us.

01:02:23.581 --> 01:02:25.581
Why?
Well, why does it matter?

01:02:26.661 --> 01:02:28.861
What I do with my money
is none of your business.

01:02:28.901 --> 01:02:30.901
Oh, yes, it is, love,

01:02:30.941 --> 01:02:33.501
when you're settling the debt
of a murder victim.

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:36.421
We made a deal, Freddie and me.

01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:40.181
What kind of deal?
I paid his debt.

01:02:40.221 --> 01:02:41.741
He stayed clear.

01:02:42.901 --> 01:02:45.301
Stayed clear of what?
Jade and Riley.

01:02:46.421 --> 01:02:49.341
You blackmailed Riley's dad?
It wasn't blackmail.

01:02:49.381 --> 01:02:50.781
It was a deal.

01:02:50.821 --> 01:02:52.621
And one he jumped at.

01:02:52.661 --> 01:02:54.501
That was the measure
of Freddie Gill.

01:02:55.501 --> 01:02:58.381
The lowlife,
he'd sell out his own blood.

01:02:59.501 --> 01:03:00.781
Where did you get the money?

01:03:02.101 --> 01:03:04.221
I took a loan out against the pub.

01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:08.501
Did you know Arthur asked him
to visit before he died?

01:03:09.941 --> 01:03:11.061
Well...

01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:14.061
..obviously,
he just wanted to say goodbye.

01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:16.661
Put everything in order, like.

01:03:19.101 --> 01:03:21.461
Where did you go
when you left the church?

01:03:21.501 --> 01:03:25.381
And don't say you were here all
night, because I know that's a lie.

01:03:25.421 --> 01:03:27.141
Tina came over to my house.

01:03:28.141 --> 01:03:30.301
We were together
for the rest of the night.

01:03:31.381 --> 01:03:32.421
Is that true?

01:03:36.981 --> 01:03:39.181
STANHOPE:
She's lying through her teeth.

01:03:39.221 --> 01:03:41.421
There's no way
she'd part with that kind of money

01:03:41.461 --> 01:03:42.901
just to keep Freddie away.

01:03:42.941 --> 01:03:45.821
HEALY:Well, she might if she thought
she could protect Riley from him.

01:03:45.861 --> 01:03:47.541
No, she was scared.

01:03:47.581 --> 01:03:49.101
Same as Lee was scared.

01:03:49.141 --> 01:03:50.861
You think Freddie
has something on them?

01:03:50.901 --> 01:03:52.141
That's what I want to find out.

01:03:52.181 --> 01:03:53.621
Call the hospital.

01:03:53.661 --> 01:03:55.821
See if we can talk
to Laura Whitelock again.

01:03:55.861 --> 01:03:59.021
And let's have another look
at this attack on Nasir Ali.

01:03:59.061 --> 01:04:01.821
Because if Gill's debt
had been paid in full,

01:04:01.861 --> 01:04:04.621
why send the heavies round
to torch the garage?

01:04:04.661 --> 01:04:05.741
Hm?

01:04:09.341 --> 01:04:11.621
Our witness described the man
running from the garage

01:04:11.661 --> 01:04:13.781
as tall, wearing a hooded jacket.

01:04:13.821 --> 01:04:16.861
So, I checked some traffic cameras
in the area and found this.

01:04:16.901 --> 01:04:18.701
A camera on Cannery Street.

01:04:20.901 --> 01:04:22.821
Ah, you can't see his face.

01:04:22.861 --> 01:04:24.701
Yeah, you can't see the reg plate,
either.

01:04:24.741 --> 01:04:26.581
Well, not from this angle, anyway.

01:04:28.301 --> 01:04:30.261
Stop it!
Rewind, Mark.

01:04:30.301 --> 01:04:31.701
Rewind.

01:04:32.701 --> 01:04:35.221
Now, what's that
on the back windscreen?

01:04:35.261 --> 01:04:36.621
Is that a reflection?

01:04:37.701 --> 01:04:40.221
Or is it numbers?
It could be.

01:04:40.261 --> 01:04:42.821
It's a phone number.
It's a taxi.

01:04:43.941 --> 01:04:47.114
Aye, and who do we know
drives a cab like that?

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.880
Agrah, I need you to come with us.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.360
I'm just about to go out.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.280
No, that's gonna have to wait, love.
Come on.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.480
Agrah Ali, I am arresting you
on suspicion of arson

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.680
with intent to destroy property.
What's going on?

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.320
We need to have a chat
with your brother.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.760
Why?
He's not done anything.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.360
..which you later rely on in court.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.640
What's going on?
You have no right to arrest him!

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.840
Go inside, will you?
Do as your brother says.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.320
Saddiq!

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:18.320
Take him in.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.600
No, please...

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:20.960
Don't take Saddiq!

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.040
What can you tell us about that?

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.680
Well, I think we can all agree that
that's you, Agrah.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.240
It's certainly your cab.

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:33.800
So, what were you doing there, hm?

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.200
I must have had a hire.

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.400
Not according to the cab office.
You weren't working that night.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:42.040
No.
So, what were you doing there?

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.800
I don't remember.

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.520
OK. Well, let's see
if I can jog your memory.

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:49.640
Now, you see this here?
That's a time stamp.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.680
That tells us
that this picture was taken

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:55.080
not ten minutes after
your dad made the 999 call

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.760
on the night of the attack.

01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:00.000
And this here gives us location.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.480
Cannery Street.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.840
Now, that's, what, DS Healy?

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:06.800
15 minutes' walk from the garage?
Ten, if you're running.

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:09.680
And you were running, Agrah.

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:10.800
Hm?

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:13.120
Plus, we have a witness who saw you.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.280
So, I'll ask you one more time.

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:16.960
What were you doing there?

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.880
Look, we know it was you
who attacked your dad's garage.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.960
The question is...

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.400
..why?

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.120
No comment.

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.680
All right.
Have it your own way.

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.760
Interview suspended at 9:08.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.200
Let him stew for a bit.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.000
Something from the search team?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.880
Ah, well, the taxi's clean.
I did find this, though.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.120
What's that?

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:59.040
When was this submitted?
Yesterday afternoon.

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.240
And he's just turned up
at reception,

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.400
demanding we release his sons.

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.080
Well, that's handy.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.760
Saves us going looking for him.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.960
Kenny, put him in room two.
Ma'am.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:14.520
Now, then,
we believe Agrah was the man

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.080
who attacked you and the garage.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.600
Now, we don't know
if anyone else was involved

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.560
or why he attacked you.

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.560
Now, he's going to be charged,
one way or the other.

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.360
But we just wondered
if you had any thoughts...

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.480
..on why he might have done it.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.200
It wasn't his idea, was it?

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.320
It's hard to explain.

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.040
No, it's not that hard.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.560
The garage was going under.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:45.640
Freddie had been using it
like his own personal cash machine.

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:48.240
You owed everyone money,
from the taxman to a valet company.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.640
You've not paid a bill in months.

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.080
Except one.

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:53.680
And that was the insurance company.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.040
You made sure
those premiums were paid.

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.960
We contacted your provider.

01:07:58.080 --> 01:07:59.960
You've started the claim process
already.

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.920
I didn't know what else to do.

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:10.680
I had to salvage something.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.320
So, you and Agrah staged the attack.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.800
It was my idea.

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:18.000
I want that written down.
I want that recorded.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.720
Agrah had nothing to do with this.

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.479
I started the fire on the cars
and the garage.

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:28.760
The beating, your injuries...What,
you did that to yourself, did you?

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.560
I asked Agrah.

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:32.279
I knew it had to look right.

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:34.560
He didn't want to.
Oh, well, I can believe that.

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:37.120
And what about Freddie Gill?

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.120
Was killing him part of your plan?

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.399
What?

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:42.960
No!
I had nothing to do with that!

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.240
Yes, I planned the fire
on the garage...

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:50.040
..after Freddie was killed.
That's why I did it.

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.080
Please, I was Freddie's friend!

01:08:54.319 --> 01:08:56.680
You tried to profit from his death.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:59.120
That's not what I call a friend.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.160
What about Saddiq?

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.720
He's got an exam!

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.920
He has to be at the university
by 10:00!

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.920
KEY RATTLES IN THE LOCK

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:18.279
Have you calmed down yet?
What's happening to Agrah?

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:20.240
Well, you brother and your dad's
going to be here

01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:21.520
for a few more hours yet, love.

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.960
Now, were you involved
in any of this?

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.279
No.

01:09:25.319 --> 01:09:26.640
You're sure?

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:29.800
There's no need to lie.
Your dad's told us all about it.

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.880
I knew they were planning something,
but they wouldn't tell me.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.560
They're probably just trying
to protect you.

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.720
Now, this exam, come on.
No, I've missed it.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.960
No, there's still time.
Come on.

01:09:43.319 --> 01:09:44.479
Mark...

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:52.240
Now, then, DC Edwards here is going
to take you to the university.

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:54.960
Get him there by 10:00.
Blues and twos if you have to.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.400
Ma'am.

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.960
Well, go on.
Thank you.

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:03.280
Comforting to know
you've got a zero-tolerance policy

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:05.560
when it comes to one of your
officers being assaulted.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.520
Oh, give over.
He barely touched you.

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:12.000
Laura Whitelock. Hospital say you
can talk to her whenever you want.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.680
You know, it's fine for you
to say it's nothing.

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.840
But what about next time?

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.240
Next time, learn to duck.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:37.040
SHE GASPS

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.800
Oh, sorry, love.

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:40.000
Sorry.

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.320
I thought you were Nathan.
Oh, he's here, is he?

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.600
On his way.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.200
Says he wants to talk.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.880
I'm hoping I still have a marriage.

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:50.880
What was it you wanted?

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.720
Oh, I just wanted to see
how you are, love.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.840
And I was just wondering...

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:01.640
..when Freddie went to see Arthur
before he died...

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.480
..what did they talk about?

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.160
I don't know.

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:08.800
I was outside the room
watching for the Tripps.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:14.560
So, Freddie never mentioned
what their conversation was about?

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.880
No, there'd been nothing to mention.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.680
Arthur's mind had gone.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:22.640
One minute, he'd be talking
about his school days.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:25.840
And the next, he'd be describing
what Tina liked in bed.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.200
Why do you want to know, anyway?

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:35.080
Well, I just wondered whether
Arthur told Freddie something

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:37.000
that perhaps he shouldn't have.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.440
What?

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:44.880
Go on, what?

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.840
It's probably nothing, but...

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:50.640
..when Lee beat him up, I tried
to get Freddie to go to the police.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.440
So, why didn't he?

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.960
He said he didn't need the police.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.520
That he had other ways to hurt Lee.

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.040
Thanks, love.

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.040
You've been a great help.

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.800
Right, listen up.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:19.520
Arthur Tripp told Freddie something
before he died.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.680
I don't know what it was.

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:25.400
But it incensed Lee
and scared the hell out of Tina.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.920
What could possibly scare Tina?

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.960
Well, what's the most important thing
to her?

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.120
Family?

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.320
Aye, but not just family.
Blood.

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:36.200
Have you got the background
on Darren Tripp?

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:37.640
Yeah.

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.120
Thanks, love.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.360
Aye, we need to talk to Tina.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.560
Well, she's at the family
solicitor's.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.360
They're reading Arthur Tripp's
will today.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.160
The whole family will be there.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.360
Have you got an address?
It's Grey Street, ma'am.

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.680
Right, Aiden...

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:12.160
Hey, what's happened?

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.440
It was Lee.

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.600
There was a bit of a shock after
Dad's will. A big one.

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.560
He's left the pub to Mam

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.720
and after that it's going to Riley.

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:23.120
Lee gets nothing.

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.400
Where is your mam?

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.280
She's in there.

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:35.640
1983.

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:41.040
And one day,
Darren decides to join the Navy.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:43.680
And six months later...

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:45.000
..Lee is born.

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:49.000
Now, it may just be a coincidence.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.400
But, erm...

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:57.040
..25 is a bit late to be embarking
on a life at sea, isn't it?

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.920
Was Lee the reason Darren left?

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.120
Hm?

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:09.200
Darren thought it was best
if he went away for a while.

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:11.240
Or did you ask him to leave?

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.600
We made the decision together.

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.520
What happened between us
was a mistake.

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.920
A stupid, clumsy one-off.

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:21.320
We both regretted it.

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:25.920
And we both loved Arthur too much
to break his heart.

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.480
So...

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:29.920
Oh, we paid our penance.

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.640
Darren went and I stayed.

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:39.640
And I put everything I had
into Arthur and our family.

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:43.880
And you passed Lee off
as your husband's son.

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.640
Lee was his son.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.440
He is his son.

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:51.720
Nah. I'm sorry, love. But that will
says Arthur thought different.

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.800
Arthur must've known all along.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.960
All those years.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.760
And he said nothing.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.200
Mm.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:03.960
Till he told Freddie.

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.080
I can't believe
he would've told him.

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:09.480
Not intentionally.

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:13.600
But he wasn't in his right mind
towards the end.

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.640
It must have tumbled
out of his mouth

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:17.400
with all of his nonsense.
But...

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:19.680
..oh, our Freddie caught it.

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:21.680
And as soon as he did,
he came straight to me.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.320
And what did he say?

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:27.520
He knew Lee wasn't Arthur's son.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:30.080
He said Riley had more right
to the pub and that, er...

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.600
..that he'd contest the will.

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:36.000
So, you offered
to pay off Freddie's debt.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.600
And in return
he kept his mouth shut.

01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.400
I was desperate.

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.360
What else could I do?

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:45.240
I had to protect Lee.

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.400
SHE CHUCKLES

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.120
And it was all for nothing.

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:54.200
It turns out Arthur...

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.960
..had cut Lee out of the will,
anyway.

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.000
I mean, what's that about?

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:04.440
Huh? Who waits till they're dead
to get their revenge?

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:08.080
Someone who felt very wronged, love.

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:11.360
But it wasn't Lee who wronged him.
Why make him suffer?

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.000
Why not punish me?

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.920
Well, how do you feel about
your son suffering?

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.120
Hm?

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:23.200
There's your punishment, love.
We need to find Lee.

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.840
Why?

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.000
He hasn't done anything.

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.280
The pub's closed.

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:49.360
Everybody, out.

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:51.640
Everybody, out!

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:56.880
Uncle Lee?

01:17:05.404 --> 01:17:06.724
GLASSES SMASH

01:17:06.764 --> 01:17:09.644
SIRENS BLARE

01:17:11.484 --> 01:17:13.124
Uncle Lee's smashing up the pub!

01:17:16.804 --> 01:17:17.884
Stay where you are.

01:17:19.124 --> 01:17:20.844
GLASSES SMASH

01:17:25.604 --> 01:17:26.804
Lee...
Get out!

01:17:26.844 --> 01:17:29.164
That's not going to help you, love.

01:17:29.204 --> 01:17:30.524
Leave me alone.

01:17:30.564 --> 01:17:33.644
I need you to calm down, Lee.
Calm down!

01:17:33.684 --> 01:17:35.524
Yeah?
This is my pub.

01:17:35.564 --> 01:17:37.564
Do you understand?

01:17:37.604 --> 01:17:39.044
It's my pub!

01:17:39.084 --> 01:17:41.044
I put my life into this.

01:17:42.444 --> 01:17:43.844
I worked my guts out for it.

01:17:43.884 --> 01:17:45.324
It's mine!

01:17:48.884 --> 01:17:50.044
It's mine...

01:17:53.364 --> 01:17:56.764
HE SOBS

01:18:02.724 --> 01:18:04.204
Lee, love...

01:18:15.364 --> 01:18:17.164
ENGINE STARTS

01:18:22.084 --> 01:18:23.844
So, where did you go, Lee?

01:18:25.764 --> 01:18:27.004
Come on.

01:18:28.244 --> 01:18:30.084
Were you on your way to Freddie's?

01:18:31.644 --> 01:18:35.564
Now, Freddie told you
about your mam and Darren, didn't he?

01:18:35.604 --> 01:18:36.604
Hm?

01:18:37.604 --> 01:18:41.244
He told you Arthur wasn't your real
dad. Oh, that must've been hard.

01:18:41.284 --> 01:18:44.164
It wasn't hard for Freddie.

01:18:44.204 --> 01:18:46.044
He really enjoyed telling me.

01:18:46.084 --> 01:18:47.564
And what a shock.

01:18:48.684 --> 01:18:50.444
It wasn't a shock.

01:18:50.484 --> 01:18:53.004
Well, it was at first, but...

01:18:55.004 --> 01:18:57.564
..when I thought about it,
it made sense.

01:18:57.604 --> 01:18:59.764
Dad and me, we never really...

01:19:01.324 --> 01:19:02.724
..clicked.

01:19:04.244 --> 01:19:05.684
We weren't close.

01:19:07.644 --> 01:19:10.324
I used to think,
if I could just be more like him,

01:19:10.364 --> 01:19:13.244
if I took more of an interest in
him, in the pub, that we'd...

01:19:14.564 --> 01:19:16.004
..that we'd come together.

01:19:18.764 --> 01:19:20.884
At least now I know why we didn't.

01:19:22.604 --> 01:19:24.324
At least I know it wasn't my fault.

01:19:27.484 --> 01:19:29.964
That was taken on Osterhead Road.

01:19:30.004 --> 01:19:31.924
On your way into Newcastle.

01:19:31.964 --> 01:19:33.644
Heading to Freddie's.

01:19:34.764 --> 01:19:37.364
About four miles outside
the village, there's a junction.

01:19:38.524 --> 01:19:41.364
The road takes you up to a car park.
There you can get onto the hill.

01:19:41.404 --> 01:19:43.044
Do you know it?
Aye, I do.

01:19:43.084 --> 01:19:45.244
Dad used to take us up there
when we were little.

01:19:46.244 --> 01:19:47.724
That's where I was going.

01:19:49.484 --> 01:19:51.604
I just sat in the car...

01:19:51.644 --> 01:19:52.964
..thinking.

01:19:54.164 --> 01:19:55.884
Thinking about...

01:19:55.924 --> 01:19:58.564
..about Dad,
about what it all meant.

01:19:58.604 --> 01:20:01.164
And what did it all mean?

01:20:03.004 --> 01:20:04.324
Nothing.

01:20:06.044 --> 01:20:08.524
I realised it didn't matter
if I wasn't his son.

01:20:09.684 --> 01:20:11.364
Obviously, it didn't matter to Dad.

01:20:12.404 --> 01:20:14.124
He'd raised me as his own.

01:20:14.164 --> 01:20:16.124
30-odd years without a word.

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:20.844
I figured, if he was happy
to call me his son...

01:20:22.684 --> 01:20:24.564
..then it was OK.

01:20:24.604 --> 01:20:28.404
But in the end, it wasn't OK,
was it, Lee?

01:20:29.724 --> 01:20:31.084
I won't lie.

01:20:31.124 --> 01:20:32.964
The will was a shock.

01:20:35.364 --> 01:20:37.924
I guess you realise what's important
to you when you're dying.

01:20:39.564 --> 01:20:41.884
It seems blood was important to Dad.

01:20:44.884 --> 01:20:46.804
It's as if I didn't exist.

01:20:48.964 --> 01:20:51.604
There's no-one who can corroborate
him being up at that car park.

01:20:51.644 --> 01:20:53.604
No-one to contradict him, either.

01:20:53.644 --> 01:20:55.524
Oh, come on, he's got the motive.

01:20:55.564 --> 01:20:58.484
Freddie Gill blew up his life when
he told him he wasn't Arthur's son.

01:20:58.524 --> 01:21:02.004
No, he'd made his peace with that.
He thought it didn't matter.

01:21:02.044 --> 01:21:04.364
Until today,
when they read that will.

01:21:04.404 --> 01:21:06.124
Ma'am, I ran Lee Tripp's prints

01:21:06.164 --> 01:21:08.924
against the ones we found
at the crime scene. No match.

01:21:08.964 --> 01:21:11.604
But the lab did get back to us
on Gill's bag, though.

01:21:11.644 --> 01:21:14.204
They found identical prints
to the ones on the bedroom window.

01:21:14.244 --> 01:21:16.524
Well, great.
So, what does that tell us?

01:21:16.564 --> 01:21:18.684
It tells us it wasn't planned.

01:21:21.524 --> 01:21:23.444
They came in through that window.

01:21:24.484 --> 01:21:26.324
Found the bag.

01:21:26.364 --> 01:21:28.884
Found the gun inside the bag.

01:21:28.924 --> 01:21:30.924
And then shot Freddie Gill.

01:21:30.964 --> 01:21:32.964
Yeah, but why?
They didn't go there to kill him.

01:21:33.004 --> 01:21:36.764
It was finding that gun
that gave them that option.

01:21:38.604 --> 01:21:40.164
So, what happened?

01:21:40.204 --> 01:21:41.684
Hm?

01:21:41.724 --> 01:21:43.684
What tipped them over the edge?

01:21:45.444 --> 01:21:48.164
Was it something
Freddie Gill said to them?

01:21:48.204 --> 01:21:50.524
Or was it something else
they found in the house? What?

01:21:50.564 --> 01:21:52.444
There was nothing in that house.
It was empty.

01:21:52.484 --> 01:21:53.764
Gill was leaving.

01:21:57.124 --> 01:21:58.524
What?

01:22:00.484 --> 01:22:02.364
They thought he was running away.

01:22:06.564 --> 01:22:08.204
Now, who had the most to lose...

01:22:09.484 --> 01:22:10.764
..if Freddie disappeared?

01:22:12.244 --> 01:22:14.124
Mr Ali and his sons.

01:22:14.164 --> 01:22:18.364
Jac, will you run those crime scene
prints off the database again?

01:22:18.404 --> 01:22:19.724
Full search.

01:22:19.764 --> 01:22:23.364
Mark, the lad
you ran up to the university...

01:22:23.404 --> 01:22:25.844
Oh, that was a waste of time.
They wouldn't let him in.

01:22:25.884 --> 01:22:27.004
Why not?

01:22:27.044 --> 01:22:29.204
Well, it looks like you can't sit
your second exam

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:30.844
if you didn't show up
for the first one.

01:22:32.324 --> 01:22:34.084
Is that right?

01:22:39.964 --> 01:22:41.444
I'm, sorry.

01:22:41.484 --> 01:22:42.924
Erm...

01:22:42.964 --> 01:22:44.564
I was just wondering.

01:22:44.604 --> 01:22:46.844
Saddiq's first exam...

01:22:48.004 --> 01:22:50.164
..when was that?
Hm?

01:22:50.204 --> 01:22:51.564
His first exam.

01:22:51.604 --> 01:22:54.044
The one before the one
he's doing today.

01:22:54.084 --> 01:22:56.524
When was that?
A few days ago.

01:22:56.564 --> 01:22:59.884
Was it the day Freddie Gill died?

01:23:29.884 --> 01:23:31.324
Saddiq...?

01:23:39.644 --> 01:23:41.284
Why did you do it?

01:23:43.124 --> 01:23:44.604
For Dad.

01:23:44.644 --> 01:23:46.084
Obviously.

01:23:46.124 --> 01:23:48.564
I couldn't let Freddie
run out on him,

01:23:48.604 --> 01:23:51.084
leave him with that bloody garage,
all that debt.

01:23:51.124 --> 01:23:53.724
He's on his knees as it is.
So why shoot him?

01:23:53.764 --> 01:23:55.764
He's no use to your dad dead, is he?

01:23:55.804 --> 01:23:57.604
I saw him coming.

01:23:58.764 --> 01:24:01.724
I saw Freddie for what he was
as soon as I met him.

01:24:01.764 --> 01:24:03.764
Oh...
All talk.

01:24:03.804 --> 01:24:05.804
Making a big show over Dad.

01:24:09.084 --> 01:24:10.484
I tried to warn Dad.

01:24:10.524 --> 01:24:12.204
But he didn't listen.

01:24:12.244 --> 01:24:13.764
And look what happened.

01:24:15.124 --> 01:24:16.964
The bastard cheated him!

01:24:18.004 --> 01:24:19.164
He's lost everything.

01:24:19.204 --> 01:24:23.044
Look, I don't doubt
that Freddie made your dad suffer.

01:24:23.084 --> 01:24:25.364
But that didn't give you the right
to shoot him.

01:24:25.404 --> 01:24:27.524
No, I tried with Freddie.

01:24:28.644 --> 01:24:31.164
I really did.
I gave him every chance.

01:24:31.204 --> 01:24:33.804
I asked him countless times.
I pleaded with him.

01:24:35.484 --> 01:24:41.084
Wind up the business if he had to,
but just stop bleeding Dad dry.

01:24:42.084 --> 01:24:43.164
Look...

01:24:45.044 --> 01:24:47.724
You didn't go to Freddie's house
to kill him.

01:24:47.764 --> 01:24:50.244
So...why were you there?

01:24:51.324 --> 01:24:53.484
I wanted to talk to him again.
About what?

01:24:53.524 --> 01:24:55.644
To give him one last chance.

01:24:57.284 --> 01:24:59.124
When I saw where he was living,

01:24:59.164 --> 01:25:01.324
I couldn't believe it
when I got in there.

01:25:02.284 --> 01:25:06.004
There's Dad killing himself
every day at that poxy garage and...

01:25:07.004 --> 01:25:08.404
..Freddie's living like a king.

01:25:08.444 --> 01:25:09.924
Mm.

01:25:11.084 --> 01:25:12.804
I spent hours in that place...

01:25:14.204 --> 01:25:16.844
..going round every room,
getting angrier.

01:25:18.204 --> 01:25:19.844
And you found the gun.

01:25:20.844 --> 01:25:22.684
I didn't plan on using it.

01:25:23.964 --> 01:25:25.804
But when he came home...

01:25:26.924 --> 01:25:30.084
..all that rage just...boiled up.

01:25:30.124 --> 01:25:31.364
Mm.

01:25:31.404 --> 01:25:33.004
And what about Laura?

01:25:34.324 --> 01:25:36.164
The lass waiting for him in the car.

01:25:36.204 --> 01:25:38.364
Oh, no, no, I panicked.
I panicked.

01:25:38.404 --> 01:25:40.644
I was...
I was on my way out.

01:25:40.684 --> 01:25:41.884
I saw her running.

01:25:41.924 --> 01:25:43.124
I just...

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:51.124
I didn't...

01:25:52.124 --> 01:25:53.684
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

01:25:54.924 --> 01:25:56.724
I just wanted to help me dad.

01:26:05.484 --> 01:26:07.204
The thing is, son...

01:26:08.804 --> 01:26:11.884
..your dad may have been going
through a hard time, but...

01:26:12.964 --> 01:26:16.284
..he had one bright spot in his life.

01:26:16.324 --> 01:26:17.844
And that was you.

01:26:19.404 --> 01:26:22.324
He had such high hopes for you.

01:26:24.404 --> 01:26:26.364
But now those hopes...

01:26:28.164 --> 01:26:29.564
..they're gone.

01:26:34.124 --> 01:26:37.604
You've done more damage to your dad
than Freddie Gill ever did.

01:27:33.924 --> 01:27:35.484
Well...

01:27:35.524 --> 01:27:37.964
I hear you got a share in the pub.

01:27:39.044 --> 01:27:40.444
I don't want it.

01:27:40.484 --> 01:27:42.724
Mam says I can sign it over
to Uncle Lee if I want.

01:27:42.764 --> 01:27:44.124
Well...

01:27:45.764 --> 01:27:47.884
He made a mess of everything.

01:27:47.924 --> 01:27:49.644
Dad, I mean.

01:27:49.684 --> 01:27:51.164
He hurt everyone.

01:27:52.164 --> 01:27:54.284
But he didn't deserve to die, pet.

01:27:54.324 --> 01:27:55.564
No.

01:27:56.964 --> 01:27:58.204
But it's hard to think of him

01:27:58.244 --> 01:28:00.084
without thinking of
all the other crap.

01:28:00.124 --> 01:28:01.324
SHE CHUCKLES

01:28:01.364 --> 01:28:03.084
I know how you feel.

01:28:04.404 --> 01:28:07.084
So, come on,
what's your best memory of your dad?

01:28:07.124 --> 01:28:08.764
What do you mean?

01:28:09.844 --> 01:28:11.484
The best memory of my dad?

01:28:11.524 --> 01:28:13.724
Erm, well, when I was a nipper...

01:28:14.924 --> 01:28:17.484
..he took me to see
some bird's eggs hatching.

01:28:17.524 --> 01:28:20.444
And, oh, that was so beautiful.

01:28:22.644 --> 01:28:25.524
Mind you, I didn't know then
he was gonna start nicking 'em.

01:28:27.364 --> 01:28:29.884
So, come on,
your best memory of your dad?

01:28:31.324 --> 01:28:32.764
I don't know.

01:28:33.924 --> 01:28:35.484
Sitting in his car.

01:28:35.524 --> 01:28:37.084
Him driving.

01:28:37.124 --> 01:28:39.924
Singing along to some lame song
he'd found on the radio.

01:28:39.964 --> 01:28:41.884
Well, there you go, then.

01:28:42.324 --> 01:28:45.164
That's how you think of him
from now on.

01:28:46.844 --> 01:28:49.724
Now, go on, hop it.
You're going to be late.
