06:44.556 --> 06:46.135
I mean, otherwise,

07:17.024 --> 07:20.412

07:20.512 --> 07:22.328

11:02.091 --> 11:06.657
So you know a bit
about music then?

11:08.930 --> 11:11.767
My father used to play in
the orchestra back at home.

11:11.868 --> 11:14.465
He played violin.

11:16.507 --> 11:19.243
But he got arthritis then,
and he killed himself.

11:19.343 --> 11:20.677
Really?

11:20.777 --> 11:24.480
But before he go, he teach me
how to play piano.

11:24.580 --> 11:26.883
'It's not so hard
on the fingers' he said.

11:26.983 --> 11:30.034
Do you get to play much?

11:30.134 --> 11:33.223
Hmm. No, I don't, I don't
have a piano at home.

11:33.323 --> 11:35.326
I can't get one in Ireland;
it's so much money.

11:35.426 --> 11:37.428
I can't afford it.

11:38.664 --> 11:41.215
Yeah, it's expensive all right.

11:49.540 --> 11:51.109
I play in a piano shop.

11:51.209 --> 11:52.578
This man lets me play-

11:52.678 --> 11:54.929
one hour per day at lunch.

11:55.030 --> 11:57.596
Somewhere around here?

11:57.696 --> 11:58.949

11:59.049 --> 12:01.001

- Now?

12:01.102 --> 12:01.986
Yeah.

12:02.086 --> 12:04.318
Okay.

12:07.493 --> 12:09.495

12:18.304 --> 12:20.206

14:00.410 --> 14:03.263

- How's it going?

42:45.673 --> 42:46.875
Pretty good.

42:46.975 --> 42:48.810
- Pretty good.
- Good to see you.

42:48.910 --> 42:51.280
I'm going to go to
London, I've decided.

42:51.380 --> 42:52.382
- Good.
- Yeah.

42:52.482 --> 42:53.482
That's great.

42:53.516 --> 42:54.949
Yeah, it's good, it makes sense.

42:55.049 --> 42:56.751
Well done.

42:56.851 --> 42:58.420
When are you going?

42:58.520 --> 43:00.603
I'm going to go Monday.

43:00.703 --> 43:02.940
Wow, that's, that's soon.

43:03.040 --> 43:05.528
You'll get your girlfriend back,

43:05.628 --> 43:07.564
and you'll get
your record deal, and...

43:07.664 --> 43:10.618
- become famous.
- Yeah, right.

43:10.718 --> 43:11.933
- Good.
- But listen,

43:12.033 --> 43:13.678
I was thinking, I was
thinking before I go,

43:13.702 --> 43:15.637
I want to make a recording
of a few songs.

43:15.737 --> 43:17.282
A couple of the songs
I was playing you,

43:17.306 --> 43:19.709
and I really liked the way
you played and your singing.

43:19.809 --> 43:22.312
So, if you feel like, would
you be into playing along?

43:22.412 --> 43:23.679
Like what we were playing on?

43:23.779 --> 43:25.616
- I would sing and play?
- Yeah.

43:25.716 --> 43:27.084
I'd love that.

43:27.184 --> 43:28.484
Really? Cool.

43:28.584 --> 43:30.920
- So you'd be in my band for a few days.
- Yeah.

43:31.020 --> 43:35.140
Well, that's the first thing
I've got sorted out.

43:35.240 --> 43:36.960
Now I just need to sort
everything else out.

43:36.994 --> 43:39.830
All right, guys, welcome.

43:41.633 --> 43:43.667
Now, so let me
give you the tour.

43:43.768 --> 43:46.202
That is your
live rooms in there.

43:46.303 --> 43:47.837
This is a new desk.

43:47.937 --> 43:50.874
You got your hard drive and
you got your outboard gear.

43:50.974 --> 43:52.410
Now all in all
we're talking about

43:52.510 --> 43:53.587
three grand for a weekend of...

43:53.611 --> 43:54.612
- Three?
- Yeah.

43:54.712 --> 43:56.147
Three grand, that's pretty good.

43:56.247 --> 43:57.550
You must be crazy.

43:57.650 --> 43:58.750
$3,000

43:58.850 --> 44:01.136
Well, have a look around.

44:01.236 --> 44:03.801
You've everything you need.

44:03.901 --> 44:06.790
- What do you think, is it good?
- It's pretty good.

44:06.890 --> 44:09.311
We'll give you one.

44:11.095 --> 44:12.095
I'm sorry.

44:12.163 --> 44:13.466
Have you heard this guy's songs?

44:13.566 --> 44:14.867
I haven't yet, no.

44:14.967 --> 44:15.967
He's great.

44:16.035 --> 44:17.035
Okay, but, uh,

44:17.102 --> 44:20.504
listen, I can fill
this place in an hour.

44:22.540 --> 44:25.604
One and a half then,
that's my limit.

44:27.379 --> 44:29.181
We can talk about two.

44:29.281 --> 44:30.816
We don't talk.

44:30.916 --> 44:32.152
We shake.

44:32.252 --> 44:33.386
We shake on two, yeah?

44:33.486 --> 44:35.288
Shake now?

44:35.388 --> 44:36.491
All right.

44:36.591 --> 44:37.490
Two thousand.

44:37.590 --> 44:38.657
She drives a hard bargain.

44:38.757 --> 44:40.760
She's a tough cookie.

44:44.731 --> 44:47.314
So you like this shop?

44:47.414 --> 44:49.652
I buy all my clothes here.

44:49.752 --> 44:51.639
It's good for me, you know?

44:51.739 --> 44:53.307
Cheap.

44:53.407 --> 44:55.433
Nice fashions.

44:56.576 --> 44:57.576
Okay, you ready?

44:57.610 --> 44:59.705
Yeah, I'm ready.

45:04.919 --> 45:06.487
That's good. That will do.

45:06.587 --> 45:08.423
Do you like it?

45:08.523 --> 45:09.625
You're gorgeous.

45:09.725 --> 45:11.725
All right, can we go?

45:37.686 --> 45:38.987
The quality is poor,

45:39.087 --> 45:42.125
but if we can get
a professional tape,

45:42.225 --> 45:46.818
I'm, I'm satisfied that he
can secure a lucrative deal.

45:48.463 --> 45:50.599
You take it home, you,
you listen to it.

45:50.700 --> 45:51.933
You play it to your boss.

45:52.033 --> 45:55.012
I'm sure you can
get him to approve.

45:55.972 --> 45:57.240
Can I show you something?

Good, how is it today?

46:39.149 --> 46:40.050

46:40.150 --> 46:41.720
Have a look there yourself.

46:41.820 --> 46:43.822
Is that it? Is that it?

46:45.055 --> 46:46.434
That's how it's
going at the moment.

46:46.458 --> 46:47.592
Listen, I wanted to ask you,

46:47.693 --> 46:49.303
as myself and herself
are making a tape...

46:49.327 --> 46:50.529
How's it going?
All right?

46:50.629 --> 46:52.932
Of a few songs down
at Samson's Studios

46:53.032 --> 46:55.313
and I was just wondering, if
you were around next weekend,

46:55.365 --> 46:57.702
for, to, if you'd be
interested in doing it.

46:57.802 --> 46:58.703
A bit of recording?

46:58.803 --> 46:59.704
Bit of recording, yeah?

46:59.805 --> 47:01.206
Yeah, doing Lizzy
stuff. or...?

47:01.306 --> 47:02.941
No, it's not Lizzy,
it's me own songs.

47:03.041 --> 47:04.143
We only do Lizzy.

47:04.243 --> 47:07.164
Really. It's one
of our things.

47:07.264 --> 47:11.084
That sort of stuff. Is it, sort
of rocky Lizzy stuff or...?

47:11.184 --> 47:13.568
- No. No, it's not.
- Yeah,

47:13.669 --> 47:14.754
Singer-songwriter stuff?

47:14.854 --> 47:16.164
It's kind of singer-songwriter, yeah.

47:16.188 --> 47:17.556
- Kinda...
- Is it any good?

47:17.656 --> 47:18.557
- Uh...
- It's great.

47:18.657 --> 47:20.059
Is it?

47:20.159 --> 47:21.060
Well, look, like I said,

47:21.160 --> 47:22.505
I don't really know
much about them,

47:22.529 --> 47:23.673
but they seem like nice people.

47:23.697 --> 47:25.241
Yeah. I just have to
call my mother first.

47:25.265 --> 47:26.265
- Then we go.
- Cool.

47:26.333 --> 47:27.333

I just came out.
You want to go for a spin?

50:59.287 --> 51:00.421
That's your bike?

51:00.521 --> 51:01.589
It's me dad's.

51:01.690 --> 51:03.330
He absolutely loves it,
but I've robbed it

51:03.392 --> 51:04.393
off him for the day.

51:04.493 --> 51:05.694
If he knew, he'd kill me.

51:05.794 --> 51:08.276
Would he?

51:08.376 --> 51:10.662
So do you fancy a spin, no?

51:11.701 --> 51:13.802
I'd love to,
but I have to go to work.

51:13.902 --> 51:15.871
That's cool.

51:15.971 --> 51:17.940
Another time, yeah?

51:19.441 --> 51:22.335
And see if you were
into going now.

51:24.014 --> 51:25.582
Could you have me back by lunch?

51:25.682 --> 51:27.765
Yeah, totally.

51:27.865 --> 51:29.520
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

51:29.620 --> 51:30.519
Fancy it?

51:30.619 --> 51:32.621
Great.

52:09.293 --> 52:12.147
You're what?

52:12.247 --> 52:13.331
You're married.

52:13.431 --> 52:15.433
Does it surprise you?

52:16.368 --> 52:18.370
Fuck's sake.

52:19.572 --> 52:22.154
Yeah.

52:22.254 --> 52:23.607
When?

52:23.708 --> 52:26.945
Two years ago, when I find out
I'm pregnant with Ivonka.

52:29.864 --> 52:32.832
So where is he?

52:32.932 --> 52:34.320
He's back in Czech Republic.

52:34.420 --> 52:38.673
It's over now and, you know,
I come here on my own.

52:40.592 --> 52:42.594
Man.

52:45.064 --> 52:47.067
You all right?

52:58.411 --> 53:00.995
What's the Czech for 'ocean'?

53:01.095 --> 53:01.982
Ott-san.

53:02.082 --> 53:02.983
Ott-san.

53:03.083 --> 53:04.518
Pretty much the same.

53:04.618 --> 53:06.620
Otsan.

53:08.690 --> 53:10.732
So what are you gonna do?

53:12.895 --> 53:14.895
I don't know.

53:17.030 --> 53:20.615
There's such distance
between me and him.

53:20.716 --> 53:23.605
He's so much different
to me and so much older.

53:23.705 --> 53:27.960
It doesn't really work.

53:28.060 --> 53:29.946
I'm fine on my own, you know?

53:30.046 --> 53:34.980
It's just, I don't want Ivonka
to grow up without a father.

53:39.722 --> 53:43.253
What's the Czech for...
'Do you love him?'

53:44.393 --> 53:45.661
Noor-esh-ho?

53:45.762 --> 53:47.629
Noor-esh-ho?

53:47.729 --> 53:49.297
So...

53:49.397 --> 53:51.399
Noor-esh-ho?

53:52.935 --> 53:54.937
Noor-ho-tebbe.

53:56.805 --> 53:57.673
What?

53:57.773 --> 53:59.308
Come on, let's go.

53:59.408 --> 54:00.477
What'd you say?

54:00.577 --> 54:03.313
- Tell me.
- You've got to teach me how to ride

54:03.413 --> 54:05.798
- the bike now, eh?
- No way.

54:05.898 --> 54:06.898
- Yeah.
- No.

54:06.982 --> 54:08.751
So come on, can I have a go?

54:08.851 --> 54:09.752
No.

54:09.852 --> 54:11.054
Please.

54:11.154 --> 54:14.137
No, leave it alone, will you?

54:14.238 --> 54:17.409
But teach me how to
drive it, will you?

54:17.509 --> 54:18.362
Come on, just once.

54:18.462 --> 54:19.362
No, it's not mine.

54:19.463 --> 54:20.507
Me dad would go fucking crazy.

54:20.531 --> 54:21.531
But he's not here now.

54:21.565 --> 54:22.465
Be careful, will you!

54:22.565 --> 54:23.934
Be careful, for fuck's sake.

54:24.034 --> 54:25.268
Look, he's not here now.

54:25.368 --> 54:27.337
- Just teach me.
- Look, my dad. Look. No, no, no.

54:27.437 --> 54:28.338
- No?
- No.

54:28.438 --> 54:31.359
- Please?
- No.

54:31.459 --> 54:32.877
Me dad will go bleedin' mental.

54:32.977 --> 54:34.445
He totally loves this thing.

54:34.545 --> 54:36.281
Yeah, but you drive it.

54:36.381 --> 54:37.850
Yeah, he doesn't know I have it.

54:37.950 --> 54:38.851
He doesn't?

54:38.949 --> 54:39.950
No.

54:40.050 --> 54:42.887
Well, then he won't
know I had it, too.

54:42.987 --> 54:46.308
No.
You can't have a go on it.

54:46.408 --> 54:47.292
Just once.

54:47.392 --> 54:48.293
No.

54:48.393 --> 54:51.646
- Turn it on for me.
- No.

54:51.746 --> 54:52.631
No.

54:52.731 --> 54:53.899
Come on, give us the keys.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.168
I'll do it myself.

54:55.268 --> 54:57.268
The key's in it.

55:07.013 --> 55:08.013
Thank you for the ride.

55:08.081 --> 55:09.124
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

55:09.148 --> 55:10.583
- For rehearsals.
- Okay, yeah.

55:10.683 --> 55:11.584
Okay.

55:11.684 --> 55:13.724
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

56:40.376 --> 56:42.411
Okay, guys, good to meet you.

56:42.511 --> 56:43.831
We've a few little
bits and pieces

56:43.913 --> 56:44.913
to set up.

56:44.947 --> 56:46.383
I want to check
the drums inside.

56:46.483 --> 56:48.902
We've already set up the kit.

56:49.002 --> 56:52.256
Yeah, I just want to, you know,
check them for sound.

56:52.356 --> 56:54.358
I checked them already; it's fine.

56:54.458 --> 56:58.260
Okay, we need to set up mics
on them for recording, yeah?

56:58.361 --> 57:00.063
Oh.

57:00.163 --> 57:01.497
Have you done much recording?

57:01.597 --> 57:02.853
- No.
- No.

57:02.953 --> 57:03.267
No.

57:03.367 --> 57:06.346
- Right. Let's get cracking.
- Yeah.

57:33.798 --> 57:35.500
Yeah, no, I can't
do it now, love.

57:35.600 --> 57:36.834
I'm stuck here in the studio

57:36.934 --> 57:38.536
with this bunch
of fucking oddballs.

57:38.636 --> 57:41.640
Can you hang on a second?
Just one second.

57:43.443 --> 57:44.777
Okay, are you ready to rock?

57:44.877 --> 57:45.744
Are we ready?

57:45.845 --> 57:47.847
Yep. We're in tune.

57:49.481 --> 57:51.516
So Al and Timmy,
on the second verse, just...

57:51.616 --> 57:53.652
this is pretty much
simple enough thing.

57:53.752 --> 57:55.312
It's in five-four,
and the second verse,

57:55.355 --> 57:57.257
I'll give you a nod
to come in there, yeah?

57:57.357 --> 57:59.401
Is that all right? And you're in
from the top with me, yeah?

57:59.425 --> 58:02.063
And you know what you're doing.

58:02.862 --> 58:06.615

There's a couple of little tech bits,

are no blonde priests?

This is beautiful, isn't it?

01:06:00.526 --> 01:06:02.863
Yeah, it's a beautiful piano,
like a Baldwin.

01:06:02.963 --> 01:06:04.030
It's a perfect piano.

01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:05.432

01:06:09.717 --> 01:06:13.406
Hmm... They're
all half-written and more ideas.

01:06:13.506 --> 01:06:15.889

Yes, I did,

01:08:52.673 --> 01:08:54.140
and he didn't like it.

01:08:54.241 --> 01:08:55.809

01:08:55.908 --> 01:08:57.912

01:09:34.948 --> 01:09:37.051
and no one will ever
find us again.

01:09:37.152 --> 01:09:38.252
- No one.
- No one.

01:09:38.353 --> 01:09:39.688

01:09:39.787 --> 01:09:41.823

and it'll be great.

01:09:41.924 --> 01:09:43.658

an album together?

01:09:43.759 --> 01:09:45.194
I'd love that, come on.

01:09:45.295 --> 01:09:46.662
Yeah, and, and I'll do

01:09:46.761 --> 01:09:47.763
the backing vocals on it?

01:09:47.863 --> 01:09:48.999

Well, we should go back to work.

01:10:04.814 --> 01:10:06.816
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:10:26.535 --> 01:10:28.138
What day is it today?

01:10:29.806 --> 01:10:31.758
Monday.

01:10:31.858 --> 01:10:34.879
I think it's time we did
the, uh, the car test.

01:10:34.979 --> 01:10:36.881
What's the car test, Eamon?

01:10:36.981 --> 01:10:39.017
We've been listening
back on these, uh,

01:10:39.117 --> 01:10:40.552
big studio speakers.

01:10:40.652 --> 01:10:43.787
So it's time we had a go
on some shitty speakers.

01:10:43.887 --> 01:10:44.956
So...

01:10:45.056 --> 01:10:46.123
All right, let's go.

01:10:46.223 --> 01:10:48.392
Let's go for a spin
and have a listen in me car.

01:10:48.492 --> 01:10:49.660
Great, man.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.996
- Yeah.
- Go have a ride, yeah?

01:10:51.096 --> 01:10:53.048
Let's go.

01:10:53.148 --> 01:10:56.697
We'll clear this up later.

01:10:57.736 --> 01:10:59.687
Timmy!

01:10:59.787 --> 01:11:02.219
Timmy!

01:11:02.319 --> 01:11:03.319
Come on.

01:11:03.375 --> 01:11:05.377
Beauty.

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:14.520
Beauty.

01:11:15.089 --> 01:11:17.089
All right.

01:13:30.845 --> 01:13:32.131
There they are.

01:13:33.366 --> 01:13:34.432
Listen, man, fucking...

01:13:34.532 --> 01:13:35.909
- Well done.
- It sounds fucking brilliant.

01:13:35.933 --> 01:13:38.045
- Thanks a lot for your help.
- Lots of luck with those.

01:13:38.069 --> 01:13:39.481
- Nice one.
- I just pressed the buttons.

01:13:39.505 --> 01:13:40.505
It was great.

01:13:40.572 --> 01:13:41.706
Nice, man, thank you.

01:13:41.806 --> 01:13:43.676
- Cool.
- You two go and get some sleep.

01:13:43.776 --> 01:13:44.776
Right, nice one.

01:13:44.843 --> 01:13:48.162
- And thanks very, very much.
- See you.

01:13:54.186 --> 01:13:55.721
So this is it.

01:13:55.821 --> 01:13:57.689
- Yeah.
- We did it.

01:13:57.789 --> 01:13:59.425
It sounds great.

01:13:59.525 --> 01:14:00.659
It does, doesn't it?

01:14:00.759 --> 01:14:01.828
Could I have one?

01:14:01.928 --> 01:14:03.288
- Yeah, yeah, totally.
- Thank you.

01:14:03.363 --> 01:14:05.682
I've got to go this way.

01:14:05.782 --> 01:14:07.717
Really.

01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:09.718
Where you going?

01:14:09.818 --> 01:14:11.770
Home.

01:14:13.106 --> 01:14:14.240
You don't want to come back?

01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:15.342
I'll make you breakfast.

01:14:15.442 --> 01:14:16.976
- We could listen to the CD, no?
- No.

01:14:17.076 --> 01:14:20.414
I have to go see Ivonka
and organize things.

01:14:20.514 --> 01:14:21.682
So do you.

01:14:21.782 --> 01:14:22.817
Yeah.

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:24.319
You're leaving.

01:14:24.419 --> 01:14:26.369
To London.

01:14:26.469 --> 01:14:27.854
What do you have to organize?

01:14:27.954 --> 01:14:29.022
What's, what's that about?

01:14:29.122 --> 01:14:31.993
I, I spoke to my
husband last night.

01:14:32.093 --> 01:14:33.260
He's coming over.

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.162
Ah, brilliant.
Fair play-That's great.

01:14:35.262 --> 01:14:36.973
- I'm really happy for you.
- It's good. Yeah.

01:14:36.997 --> 01:14:39.148
We'll try to make it work.

01:14:39.248 --> 01:14:40.469
It's for the best.

01:14:40.569 --> 01:14:41.770
Yeah.

01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:43.837
Come back and hang out,
have a cup of tea.

01:14:43.937 --> 01:14:45.273
It's the last day.
We'll hang out.

01:14:45.373 --> 01:14:47.884
Whatever, breakfast, whatever.

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:49.009
Listen to the tunes.

01:14:49.109 --> 01:14:50.978
Or you can come over later,
whatever.

01:14:51.079 --> 01:14:53.065
For what?

01:14:53.165 --> 01:14:54.816
What do you mean, what?

01:14:54.916 --> 01:14:56.851
Just hang, just come
and hang out.

01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:58.488
But we done our work.

01:14:58.588 --> 01:14:59.820
Why would I go over?

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.898
We'd just hanky panky
If I come now.

01:15:03.891 --> 01:15:05.293
What?

01:15:05.393 --> 01:15:07.395
Hanky panky?

01:15:08.129 --> 01:15:09.798
It won't be for hanky panky.

01:15:09.898 --> 01:15:11.901
I know it would.

01:15:13.903 --> 01:15:16.655
And that would be nice.

01:15:16.755 --> 01:15:17.873
Would it?

01:15:17.973 --> 01:15:20.075
- Hanky... Would it?
- Very interesting.

01:15:20.175 --> 01:15:23.171
Be worthless though.

01:15:26.483 --> 01:15:29.455
Come back later.

01:15:31.488 --> 01:15:33.491
Mmm.

01:15:37.293 --> 01:15:39.095
Okay, I'll come.

01:15:39.195 --> 01:15:40.464
Yeah?

01:15:40.564 --> 01:15:41.731
I'll come later, yeah.

01:15:41.831 --> 01:15:43.200
Brilliant.

01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:44.368
You sure?

01:15:44.468 --> 01:15:45.736
Brilliant.

01:15:45.836 --> 01:15:46.870
All right, then...

01:15:46.970 --> 01:15:48.839
Cool. See you after.
Well done.

01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:50.942
You, too.

01:17:11.425 --> 01:17:13.467
Well, what do you think?

01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:19.547
You like it?

01:17:19.647 --> 01:17:21.975
It's just a demo, you know...

01:17:22.075 --> 01:17:23.404
It's fucking brilliant.

01:17:23.504 --> 01:17:24.672
Really?

01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:26.725
Fantastic stuff.

01:17:26.825 --> 01:17:29.729
That'll be a hit, no question.

01:17:29.829 --> 01:17:32.293
When are you off?

01:17:32.393 --> 01:17:34.283
What?

01:17:34.381 --> 01:17:37.017
Well, I've a few hundred quid
for you

01:17:37.117 --> 01:17:39.572
for a deposit on a place.

01:17:39.672 --> 01:17:41.623
Going to come over and see you

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:43.725
when you're settled in.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.194
When do you think
you'll be able to go?

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:50.900
I'm going tomorrow, Dad.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.950
Good man.

01:17:53.050 --> 01:17:54.670
About time.

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:00.626
Will you be all right?

01:18:00.726 --> 01:18:02.678
What do you mean?

01:18:04.615 --> 01:18:08.850
I was all right for years
before you came along, wasn't I?

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:11.219
I don't have to go now.
I can put this thing off

01:18:11.319 --> 01:18:13.055
- for a few months.
- Go.

01:18:13.156 --> 01:18:14.657
And the best

01:18:14.757 --> 01:18:16.392
of luck, son.

01:18:16.492 --> 01:18:18.027
Thanks, Dad.

01:18:18.127 --> 01:18:21.259
Make your ma proud.

01:18:24.436 --> 01:18:26.335
Now play it again.

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:29.670
Okay.

01:18:29.939 --> 01:18:30.939
That's good.

01:18:30.973 --> 01:18:32.443
Yeah. I recorded a few songs.

01:18:32.543 --> 01:18:34.678
Oh, yeah? What are they like?

01:18:34.779 --> 01:18:36.280
They're good.
I'm happy with them.

01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:39.099
Great.

01:18:39.199 --> 01:18:41.199
I've missed you.

01:18:41.299 --> 01:18:43.434
Yeah, me, too.

01:18:43.534 --> 01:18:46.023
Do you want me
to meet you at the airport?

01:18:46.123 --> 01:18:47.659
No. I'll come find you.

01:18:49.461 --> 01:18:52.184
I'm glad you've decided to come.

01:18:54.567 --> 01:18:57.370
Listen, I'm going
to get cut off here, all right?

01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:59.653
Money's running out.

01:18:59.754 --> 01:19:01.171
Hurry up.

01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:44.484
How are you?

01:19:44.584 --> 01:19:45.653
Hello, handsome.

01:19:45.753 --> 01:19:46.920
- Ahoy.
- Ahoy.

01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:48.523
Um, is-is herself in?

01:19:48.623 --> 01:19:49.724
No, no.

01:19:49.824 --> 01:19:51.125
Oh. Great.

01:19:53.894 --> 01:19:55.929
You don't know
where she is, do you?

01:19:56.029 --> 01:19:57.230
Uh, she's-she's working.

01:19:57.330 --> 01:19:58.766
She coming back, uh, evening.

01:19:58.866 --> 01:20:00.167
Oh, okay.

01:20:00.268 --> 01:20:02.270
Uh, will you tell her
I'm-I'm going away?

01:20:03.705 --> 01:20:05.674
Uh, will you tell
her I'll call her?

01:20:05.774 --> 01:20:07.609
Uh... Sorry.

01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:09.744
- No telephone here.
- You don't have a telephone?

01:20:09.844 --> 01:20:11.011
No telephone here, no.

01:20:11.111 --> 01:20:12.279
Damn.

01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:14.115
Um, I'll write her, yeah?

01:20:14.215 --> 01:20:16.217
Uh, you write her
a letter? Yeah?

01:20:16.317 --> 01:20:18.654
Yeah, I'll write her
a letter, yeah, yeah.

01:20:18.754 --> 01:20:19.822
You go?

Flowers?

01:20:43.595 --> 01:20:45.796
Want to buy the flowers?

01:21:05.936 --> 01:21:08.688
- Hey.
- How's it going?

01:21:08.788 --> 01:21:11.853

about something back here?

01:21:11.953 --> 01:21:13.681
Yeah, sure.
