WEBVTT

00:01.700 --> 00:04.110
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:05.954 --> 00:08.089
Well, here are the
proud parents-to-be.

00:08.157 --> 00:09.991
Yes, and we've been shopping.

00:09.992 --> 00:11.943
Yeah, look what we found.
Pretty neat, huh?

00:11.943 --> 00:13.428
Oh that's perfect.

00:13.429 --> 00:15.730
It'll do wonders for his motor
skills and his mental acuity.

00:15.731 --> 00:18.383
Oh, yeah. Check this out, we
got one for the baby, too.

00:19.852 --> 00:23.588
Our next city councilman,
ladies and gentlemen!

00:23.589 --> 00:26.357
Boy, it's gonna be tough finding
a replacement for you, Woody.

00:26.358 --> 00:28.126
Well, why would you want
to replace me, Sam?

00:28.127 --> 00:29.594
Well, you can't tend bar here

00:29.661 --> 00:31.496
and be a councilman
at the same time.

00:31.564 --> 00:32.762
That's a full-time job.

00:32.831 --> 00:34.415
It is, Sam?
Yeah.

00:34.483 --> 00:37.619
And working here at Cheers
is a full-time job, too.

00:37.687 --> 00:39.253
It is, Sam?

00:39.321 --> 00:41.189
Yes.

00:41.190 --> 00:43.274
Well, can't I tend bar
at least sometimes?

00:43.275 --> 00:46.711
I mean, what all does a city
councilman have to do anyway?

00:46.712 --> 00:48.229
Well, Woody, our present
councilman, Kevin Fogerty,

00:48.230 --> 00:50.532
rises at the crack of dawn,
6:30 to be exact.

00:50.599 --> 00:53.234
Then he showers,
shaves, goes downstairs

00:53.235 --> 00:55.436
for a leisurely breakfast
with his wife Estelle.

00:55.437 --> 00:57.271
Then he takes his son
Joseph, eight,

00:57.272 --> 01:00.392
and Hillary, 11, to the
Fenwick Elementary School.

01:00.459 --> 01:02.260
At least that was his routine

01:02.328 --> 01:06.398
before, the court order
deprived me of my right to know.

01:07.649 --> 01:10.818
Big Brother, my friends,
Big Brother!

01:12.037 --> 01:14.055
Years from now,
they're gonna ask me

01:14.123 --> 01:16.258
why I didn't see the signs.

02:02.043 --> 02:05.890
I guess I'd better
call the newspaper

02:05.891 --> 02:08.859
and put an ad in there looking
for an assistant bartender, huh?

02:08.860 --> 02:10.627
All right, all right, Sammy.

02:10.695 --> 02:13.298
Let me fill out an application.

02:13.365 --> 02:14.415
Sammy...
What?

02:14.416 --> 02:16.134
What about me?
I'd be a great bartender.

02:16.135 --> 02:17.585
Oh, come on, are
you kidding me?

02:17.586 --> 02:18.920
With those powerhouse
drinks you make?

02:18.921 --> 02:20.287
Aw, come on!

02:20.288 --> 02:22.307
Sweetheart, the last time
I let you tend bar

02:22.308 --> 02:24.559
there were 12 people who
made a naked conga line

02:24.560 --> 02:26.661
all the way out
to the commons there.

02:26.729 --> 02:30.531
And Phil over there tried
to join the Flying Wallendas.

02:30.599 --> 02:34.885
I tell you, I sobered up
real fast on that high wire.

02:34.954 --> 02:36.254
Phew.

02:36.255 --> 02:40.959
All right, so I made the drinks
a little strong that night.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.259
It's not gonna happen again.

02:42.260 --> 02:44.161
Come on, Sammy, I could
really use the money.

02:44.162 --> 02:45.730
You won't be sorry.

02:45.731 --> 02:48.049
Yeah, all right, go ahead,
I'll give you a shot. Yes!

02:48.050 --> 02:49.584
Now hold it a second!

02:49.585 --> 02:51.886
I'm the one who's supposed to
make the decisions around here.

02:51.887 --> 02:52.987
I am the manager.

02:53.055 --> 02:55.206
Now, to whom

02:55.273 --> 02:57.776
should I give this
job of bartender?

02:57.843 --> 03:00.733
How would you like me to rip
out your still-beating heart

03:00.746 --> 03:03.915
and show it to you before
you hit the ground?

03:03.983 --> 03:07.986
I've got it!
How about Carla?

03:07.987 --> 03:09.753
You know something, with
Carla being our new bartender,

03:09.754 --> 03:11.134
we're gonna need a waitress.

03:11.135 --> 03:13.424
Why don't you get on the phone
and call the agency

03:13.425 --> 03:14.425
and hire one?

03:14.426 --> 03:15.746
Think you can manage that?

03:15.760 --> 03:17.962
Yes, I think I can manage that!

03:18.030 --> 03:21.332
But could you dial?
I just had my nails done. (groans)

03:21.400 --> 03:22.534
And could you talk?

03:22.601 --> 03:25.970
I get uncomfortable
talking to strangers.

03:25.971 --> 03:27.538
Well, Carla, congratulations
on your new job.

03:27.539 --> 03:28.589
(all agreeing)

03:28.590 --> 03:30.274
Here's to Carla,
our new bartender!

03:30.275 --> 03:31.309
Hear, hear, hear.

03:31.310 --> 03:33.110
Yeah, Carla, why don't
you fire up a pitcher

03:33.111 --> 03:34.579
of those lethal
cocktails that you make?

03:34.580 --> 03:36.581
Just don't tell Sammy, okay?

03:36.582 --> 03:38.850
I'm gonna make you one pitcher
of a little drink

03:38.851 --> 03:40.418
my grandfather taught me.

03:40.485 --> 03:44.055
It's called, "I Know
My Redeemer Liveth."

03:45.858 --> 03:47.008
Is it strong?

03:47.075 --> 03:48.209
"Is it strong?"

03:48.277 --> 03:50.867
One drink and you won't
recognize your best friend.

03:52.097 --> 03:54.098
Make mine a double.

04:00.355 --> 04:03.658
Sam, this place is just a mess.

04:03.725 --> 04:05.110
Yeah, I know.

04:05.111 --> 04:07.478
Carla made one of her
specialty drinks last night.

04:07.479 --> 04:08.613
Things got out of hand.

04:11.099 --> 04:14.001
(softly):
Morning everybody.

04:14.002 --> 04:15.169
ALL:
Norm!

04:19.206 --> 04:21.826
How are you feeling, Norm?

04:21.827 --> 04:23.961
Terrible.

04:24.029 --> 04:25.897
A splitting headache.

04:25.964 --> 04:28.132
And I think I might be sick.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.701
Can I have a beer, Sammy?

04:35.107 --> 04:36.340
Hey there, Frasier.

04:36.408 --> 04:38.460
I'm sorry, Sam.

04:38.527 --> 04:41.596
Your friend Frasier is dead.

04:41.664 --> 04:45.567
What you are looking at
is his undead corpse.

04:47.352 --> 04:49.854
Here you go, pal.

04:49.922 --> 04:52.407
All right, let's review.

04:52.475 --> 04:56.511
Last night I got,
knee-walking drunk,

04:56.579 --> 05:01.383
and now I am...
back in this bar,

05:01.450 --> 05:05.854
a mere seven-and-a-half
hours later, hung over.

05:05.921 --> 05:08.356
Well, it's official.

05:08.390 --> 05:11.559
I have a problem.

05:11.627 --> 05:13.661
(phone ringing)

05:17.182 --> 05:19.684
Cheers.

05:19.752 --> 05:21.486
Hey, is that you, Cliffie?

05:21.553 --> 05:23.220
Cliff?

05:24.556 --> 05:25.923
He, uh, just woke up.

05:25.991 --> 05:27.575
He doesn't know where he is.

05:29.995 --> 05:31.296
Cliffie, calm down, man.

05:31.363 --> 05:35.233
Just, just, just look around
and describe what you see.

05:35.301 --> 05:37.969
Cliff, you're
in the office, pal.

05:39.688 --> 05:41.655
My pleasure.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.725
Uh, coffee,
please there, Sammy.

06:00.792 --> 06:02.727
I told you to watch out
for her drinks.

06:02.794 --> 06:04.795
How many did you have?

06:04.796 --> 06:06.264
Oh, I don't even remember, Sam.

06:06.265 --> 06:07.866
Don't remember much of anything

06:07.867 --> 06:13.004
after the wooden lady laughed
at me and called me a half man.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.022
Well, look at you guys.

06:15.090 --> 06:16.524
I wonder how Woody's doing.

06:16.592 --> 06:18.693
He was really knocking
'em back, huh?

06:18.694 --> 06:21.762
Oh, nobody could drink that much
and end up feeling human, Sam.

06:21.763 --> 06:22.963
Hey, everybody.

06:23.031 --> 06:26.434
Sorry I'm late.
I was doing my Nordic Track.

06:26.502 --> 06:29.737
Woody, you had as much of that
vile brew as the rest of us.

06:29.805 --> 06:31.972
How can you be so chipper
this morning?

06:32.040 --> 06:34.625
Oh, it's because of the old
Hanover hangover cure.

06:34.693 --> 06:35.743
It's very simple.

06:35.777 --> 06:38.312
First, put on your pyjamas.

06:38.380 --> 06:43.134
Then, take an aspirin
with a glass of cold water.

06:43.202 --> 06:45.312
And then, you vomit
till your nose bleeds

06:45.337 --> 06:47.972
and heave until you see
the angels.

06:48.040 --> 06:51.659
Wake up in the morning,
you feel brand-new.

06:51.727 --> 06:52.910
Boy, I am hungry.

06:52.978 --> 06:55.312
Anybody for some chilli dogs?

06:57.333 --> 06:59.633
Okay, okay, but only two.

07:08.910 --> 07:11.479
Sammy, office. Quick!

07:14.182 --> 07:15.849
What was that?

07:15.917 --> 07:19.270
That was either Carla
or the grim reaper.

07:20.472 --> 07:23.708
Dear Lord, let it
be the reaper.

07:24.202 --> 07:27.011
Come on, talk to me, will you?

07:27.012 --> 07:28.780
Oh, I, I can't even say it.

07:28.781 --> 07:31.582
It's just the worst thing that's
ever happened to me in my life.

07:31.583 --> 07:33.234
You're scaring me, sweetheart.

07:33.301 --> 07:34.441
Tell me what's going on.

07:34.469 --> 07:36.137
Okay.

07:36.204 --> 07:40.074
Last night, you know, I, I had
a few of those drinks I made

07:40.142 --> 07:41.275
and I got loaded.

07:41.343 --> 07:43.153
I warned you about
that, didn't I?!

07:43.178 --> 07:44.279
I know. I know.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.481
But, anyways, I kind
of lost track of myself

07:46.482 --> 07:49.950
and, I think I went
home with a guy.

07:50.018 --> 07:51.319
Yeah?

07:51.387 --> 07:53.054
It was a Cheers guy.

07:54.472 --> 07:56.707
Oh, Sammy, Sammy, please!

07:56.775 --> 07:58.976
Please, tell me it was you!

08:00.813 --> 08:03.547
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
it wasn't me.

08:03.615 --> 08:05.233
Oh, God!

08:05.300 --> 08:09.203
Oh, God, the options that
leaves are so horrible!

08:09.204 --> 08:11.472
All right, all right,
all right- wait a minute.

08:11.473 --> 08:13.358
Now what, what do you remember?

08:13.425 --> 08:16.060
Well, I don't remember much.

08:16.128 --> 08:19.230
Just... slow dancing
to Nat King Cole

08:19.298 --> 08:21.866
and doing it till
the sheets burned.

08:21.933 --> 08:23.501
And what else?

08:23.568 --> 08:26.437
Gotta think. Gotta think.

08:26.505 --> 08:27.905
Who was there?

08:27.906 --> 08:29.940
All right let's see,
there was Frasier.

08:29.941 --> 08:33.211
Frasier, I could
live with that.

08:33.278 --> 08:34.812
Who else?

08:34.880 --> 08:36.114
Norm?

08:36.181 --> 08:37.932
Oh, it couldn't have been him.

08:37.999 --> 08:41.269
Even drunk, I think
I'd remember that.

08:41.336 --> 08:42.470
Woody?

08:42.538 --> 08:46.224
Nah.
No.

08:46.291 --> 08:48.592
Well, I guess there's
nobody else.

08:48.660 --> 08:51.262
Well, what about Cli...
There's nobody else, Sam!

08:51.330 --> 08:52.663
Come on, sweetheart.

08:52.731 --> 08:54.265
It's gonna eat you up inside.

08:54.333 --> 08:57.252
Why don't you go talk
to each guy alone, very subtly,

08:57.319 --> 09:00.089
and just ask them what they
remember about last night?

09:00.155 --> 09:01.756
Chances are, whoever it was,

09:01.757 --> 09:04.692
he'll be just as embarrassed by
the whole situation as you are.

09:04.693 --> 09:05.893
You really think so?

09:05.961 --> 09:07.027
Yes, absolutely.

09:07.095 --> 09:08.412
That's worth a try.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.314
Yeah.

09:10.382 --> 09:11.849
Hey, Sammy.
Mm-hmm?

09:11.850 --> 09:13.817
You don't think
any less of me, do you?

09:13.818 --> 09:16.720
Well, let's see
who it is first.

09:27.866 --> 09:30.301
Hey, Fras.

09:30.368 --> 09:33.771
Pretty wild last night, huh?

09:33.839 --> 09:35.723
(chuckles)

09:35.791 --> 09:37.575
If you can call
Lilith rescuing me

09:37.576 --> 09:40.244
from accidental drowning
in my toilet pretty wild,

09:40.245 --> 09:43.014
well then, yes,
life is a cabaret.

09:48.787 --> 09:50.588
Hey, Norm.
Yeah.

09:50.655 --> 09:53.925
Do you believe all that stuff
that happened last night?

09:53.992 --> 09:57.962
I don't remember a single thing
that happened last night.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.231
I do have a bad feeling, though.

10:00.299 --> 10:01.966
Vera made me

10:02.033 --> 10:04.902
breakfast in bed this morning,

10:04.969 --> 10:08.873
and kept calling me
"Mister Two Times."

10:13.328 --> 10:16.497
Maybe it's best
I don't remember.

10:19.668 --> 10:21.602
Wood.

10:21.603 --> 10:23.988
Remember anything about
what happened last night?

10:23.989 --> 10:25.556
Well, whatever it
was I missed it.

10:25.557 --> 10:26.757
Spent most of last night

10:26.825 --> 10:28.776
listening to Phil tell stories

10:28.844 --> 10:31.245
about how he worked on
the Manhattan Project.

10:31.312 --> 10:34.548
Try sleeping with
that for 50 years.

10:42.024 --> 10:43.991
Well, that's everybody.

10:44.059 --> 10:46.260
Yeah, what about...?

10:46.327 --> 10:48.896
That's everybody, Sam!
Come on, get out there.

10:48.964 --> 10:50.047
You've got to ask him.

10:50.115 --> 10:51.883
You'll go crazy
if you don't know.

11:00.392 --> 11:02.543
Hey, uh, Cliff...

11:02.611 --> 11:04.796
(clearing throat)

11:04.863 --> 11:07.398
so, how was your
evening last night?

11:07.465 --> 11:12.170
You ought to know, Carla.

11:12.237 --> 11:14.338
It was F-U-N, fun.

11:16.591 --> 11:19.994
(sighs)

11:20.062 --> 11:24.699
How-how was it F-U-N,
fun, Cliff?

11:24.766 --> 11:27.768
Well, Carla, I spent most
of the night in the backseat

11:27.769 --> 11:29.403
of a cab with
yon Norm Peterson.

11:29.404 --> 11:32.673
Now if that isn't a recipe
for fun I don't know what is.

11:32.741 --> 11:34.075
You bet.

11:35.510 --> 11:37.361
I don't get it.
I just don't get it!

11:37.428 --> 11:39.129
That's everybody, right?

11:39.197 --> 11:40.865
Geez, I...

11:40.932 --> 11:44.368
Unless, unless I met someone.

11:44.435 --> 11:46.370
That's it.

11:46.437 --> 11:49.306
Mr. Right walked into the bar,
swept me off my feet,

11:49.374 --> 11:52.275
and we made mad, passionate love
all night long.

11:52.276 --> 11:53.944
He's probably coming back
for me tonight.

11:53.945 --> 11:55.996
You could be right.
I'll bet that's what it is.

11:55.997 --> 11:58.999
It's gotta be, because everybody
here checks out, thank God.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.634
I know I didn't miss anybody.

12:05.540 --> 12:07.724
Hey, sexy.

12:16.217 --> 12:20.704
♪ Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa,
men have named you... ♪

12:21.423 --> 12:26.343
(screaming)

12:32.117 --> 12:35.503
(Carla screaming)

12:35.570 --> 12:37.905
(screaming)

12:44.078 --> 12:48.349
Well, guys, guess who scaled
Mount Paulie last night.

12:48.416 --> 12:51.285
Uh, Paul, Paul,

12:51.286 --> 12:53.754
can I talk to you in the
office for a second, pal?

12:53.755 --> 12:55.222
Oh, sure, Sammy, I get it.

12:55.223 --> 12:57.525
Uh, afraid of the new
gunslinger in town, huh?

12:57.526 --> 12:59.276
Yeah, that's,
that's right, Paul.

12:59.928 --> 13:02.162
What's the idea, Sammy?

13:02.230 --> 13:04.231
I've got major dish
for the guys.

13:04.299 --> 13:05.366
Yeah, I know.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.468
Paul, listen, I-I, heard
about what happened

13:07.469 --> 13:10.437
between you and-
you and Carla last night.

13:12.908 --> 13:15.759
She's already been
bragging about it, huh?

13:15.827 --> 13:17.978
No. Not exactly, Paul.

13:18.046 --> 13:21.181
You know, it was wild, Sammy.

13:21.249 --> 13:23.768
All that screaming
and scratching.

13:23.769 --> 13:25.269
You should see
the nail marks...

13:25.270 --> 13:26.804
that are all up and
down her back.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.138
(chuckles)

13:28.206 --> 13:31.842
Oh, my. Yeah, uh, listen...

13:31.910 --> 13:35.412
I know what you want to do is
run out there and tell the guys,

13:35.413 --> 13:37.247
but I've got to
remind you here, Paul,

13:37.248 --> 13:38.998
a gentleman does
not kiss and tell.

13:39.017 --> 13:40.150
It's just not cool.

13:40.218 --> 13:41.569
But you do it, Sam.

13:41.636 --> 13:43.304
True. True.

13:43.371 --> 13:45.172
But I'm Sam Malone,

13:45.240 --> 13:48.475
and by definition,
everything I do is cool.

13:48.476 --> 13:50.477
You've got a point there, but
Sammy the whole thing is...

13:50.478 --> 13:52.279
Yeah, no-no, Paul,
you don't understand.

13:52.280 --> 13:56.417
Please, I've got to ask you-
keep this to yourself.

13:56.484 --> 13:59.903
Sam, you just don't get it.

13:59.904 --> 14:02.339
This kind of thing has never
happened to me before.

14:02.340 --> 14:04.908
And now, with the one
time it does happen,

14:04.909 --> 14:06.543
I can't even crow
about it just a little?

14:06.544 --> 14:07.744
Yeah, I know.

14:07.812 --> 14:09.329
I know how you feel.

14:09.397 --> 14:10.798
All right, I tell you what.

14:10.866 --> 14:12.666
Why don't you crow
in here with me

14:12.734 --> 14:14.434
and get it out of your system.

14:14.502 --> 14:15.820
Well, okay.

14:15.887 --> 14:19.223
It won't be quite
the same, but...

14:19.291 --> 14:20.457
Yes!

14:20.458 --> 14:21.708
High five, Sammy!
The Paul Monster!

14:21.709 --> 14:22.977
(hissing)

14:23.045 --> 14:25.112
Give me a P! Give me an A!

14:25.180 --> 14:27.681
Give me a U!
Give me an L! P-A-U-L!

14:27.749 --> 14:30.016
Paul! Paul! Paul! Paul!
Paul! Paul! Paul!

14:30.084 --> 14:31.202
Ah.

14:36.741 --> 14:38.475
You through?

14:38.543 --> 14:40.777
Think so, yeah.

14:40.845 --> 14:42.496
Okay, we got a deal?

14:42.497 --> 14:44.098
You're not gonna tell the guys?

14:44.099 --> 14:45.466
I won't tell 'em.

14:45.533 --> 14:46.853
But listen, I, I don't know

14:46.868 --> 14:48.978
how you're gonna keep
Carla from talking.

14:48.979 --> 14:52.606
Well, I'll have this
little conversation

14:52.607 --> 14:53.857
with her, too, okay?

14:53.925 --> 14:55.642
Better be good.

14:55.710 --> 14:58.078
Hey, listen,
while you're at it,

14:58.146 --> 15:01.048
could you just tell
her gently that, uh...

15:01.116 --> 15:03.800
this was just
a one-night thing.

15:03.868 --> 15:05.738
Paulie don't need
no clinging vines.

15:07.623 --> 15:10.374
I'll, I'll let her
down gently, Paul.

15:13.111 --> 15:14.745
Hey, uh, Paul.

15:14.746 --> 15:16.013
Paul, what was that you
were talking about,

15:16.014 --> 15:17.147
getting lucky last night, huh?

15:17.148 --> 15:20.901
Uh, no, I guess I was
making that up.

15:20.969 --> 15:23.687
Oh, poor guy.
Yeah.

15:23.755 --> 15:26.990
Sometimes I feel sorry
for old Paulie. Yeah.

15:26.991 --> 15:29.326
Hey, maybe we should have
invited him to come along

15:29.327 --> 15:31.128
with us last night.

15:31.196 --> 15:34.031
Boy, did we have ourselves
some fun or what.

15:34.099 --> 15:37.351
What all did we do, anyway?

15:37.419 --> 15:41.138
Oh, the best way to reconstruct
a night like that, Normie,

15:41.205 --> 15:43.908
is to, uh, go through
our pockets.

15:43.975 --> 15:46.410
Oh, yeah, here we go.

15:46.478 --> 15:49.780
All right, uh, here's a receipt
for the pizza place.

15:49.848 --> 15:51.382
I sort of remember that one.

15:51.449 --> 15:54.285
Yeah, $24.95,
the bowling alley. Uh-huh.

15:54.352 --> 15:57.254
200 bucks for
the tattoo parlour.

15:57.322 --> 15:59.172
And, uh, 12 bucks for the cab

15:59.240 --> 16:00.824
and the doughnut shop.

16:02.693 --> 16:05.562
Say, Cliff...

16:05.630 --> 16:07.497
what, uh, what was that one

16:07.565 --> 16:10.267
between the bowling alley
and the taxicab?

16:11.836 --> 16:15.239
Uh, Fred's Tattoo Parlor.

16:19.811 --> 16:21.945
Yeah, funny that
should be in there, huh?

16:24.416 --> 16:25.849
Yeah.

17:03.438 --> 17:05.127
I'll tell you
what's on your butt

17:05.173 --> 17:07.273
if you tell me what's on mine.

17:12.747 --> 17:14.982
Let's get it over with.

17:23.825 --> 17:27.260
Those guys spend way
too much time together.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.569
Okay, Cliff...

17:52.636 --> 17:58.875
do you want to tell me what's
tattooed forever on my butt?

17:58.943 --> 18:03.947
It's uh, a big American
flag there, Norm,

18:04.015 --> 18:07.885
with the motto "God Bless
the U.S. Post Office."

18:15.309 --> 18:20.514
What, uh, what's on mine?

18:20.581 --> 18:25.452
A big heart with
the words, "I love Vera."

18:35.763 --> 18:40.150
Guess they mixed them up, huh?

18:40.217 --> 18:42.586
I assume so.

18:44.689 --> 18:48.459
Beautiful workmanship.

18:48.526 --> 18:51.728
Yeah, you want me to come
over and show Vera?

18:56.117 --> 18:58.652
Thanks, but no.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.888
In that case, would you mind

19:00.955 --> 19:03.990
coming down to the post office
and show my supervisor?

19:04.058 --> 19:08.328
No, no, I don't
think so, Cliff.

19:08.396 --> 19:10.447
Oh, come on, sweetheart.

19:10.515 --> 19:12.449
It's not that big a deal.

19:12.517 --> 19:14.551
So you slept with Paul.

19:14.619 --> 19:16.987
I mean, you, you,
you've gone to bed

19:17.054 --> 19:19.022
with a lot of guys before.

19:19.090 --> 19:21.925
Not really, Sam.

19:21.993 --> 19:24.127
I mean, I talk a lot, you know,

19:24.195 --> 19:29.499
but when it comes right down to
it, I'm more talk than action.

19:29.567 --> 19:34.137
But even when I did fool around,
I, I always knew their names.

19:34.205 --> 19:36.639
I was always
in control, you know.

19:36.707 --> 19:40.594
Last night was the first time
I ever lost control.

19:40.662 --> 19:42.796
I stepped over the line.

19:42.864 --> 19:44.998
I am now officially a slut.

19:47.401 --> 19:49.236
Oh, come on, don't say that.

19:49.304 --> 19:52.172
I told you,
I-I talked with Paul.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.074
No one's ever gonna know.

19:54.142 --> 19:56.759
Yeah, but I know, Sam.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.828
This is a secret that I'm
gonna have to live with

19:58.829 --> 20:00.197
for the rest of my life!

20:01.632 --> 20:03.917
Well, come on, sweetheart.

20:03.985 --> 20:06.136
I mean, we all have
to live with secrets.

20:06.204 --> 20:09.923
Yeah, but not this bad.

20:09.991 --> 20:12.008
What, uh, what if I told you

20:12.076 --> 20:14.144
that I have a secret
a lot worse than this.

20:14.212 --> 20:15.512
Sammy.

20:15.513 --> 20:17.347
How could you have
a problem worse?

20:17.348 --> 20:18.715
You're perfect.

20:18.783 --> 20:23.220
You don't even know what the
rest of the world is like.

20:23.287 --> 20:24.955
Honey, I, I'm not perfect.

20:25.022 --> 20:27.458
Oh, yeah, right.

20:27.525 --> 20:32.062
All right, you really
want to know?

20:32.129 --> 20:33.363
Watch this.

20:33.431 --> 20:34.698
(gasps)

20:45.593 --> 20:46.993
Holy Mother of God!

20:47.061 --> 20:48.412
Oh, Sammy!

20:48.480 --> 20:50.013
You wear a rug!

20:50.081 --> 20:53.300
It's not a rug!
It's not a rug!

20:53.368 --> 20:56.203
It's a hair replacement system.

20:56.271 --> 20:58.055
Oh, Sammy!

20:58.123 --> 21:02.593
Look at you, you're bald!

21:02.594 --> 21:04.728
All this time,
the great Sam Malone's hair

21:04.729 --> 21:06.329
is nothing but a fraud!

21:06.397 --> 21:09.399
Hey, at least I didn't
sleep with Paul!

21:12.516 --> 21:15.806
Paul, Schmall-
that's nothing!

21:15.807 --> 21:16.857
Yeah, nothing.

21:16.908 --> 21:18.875
It was a pretty big
deal a minute ago.

21:18.876 --> 21:21.344
Yeah, well, that was before I
found out you wear a piece.

21:21.345 --> 21:25.381
Hair replacement system!
Hair replacement system!

21:25.382 --> 21:27.217
You know, if you're not going
to use the proper terminology,

21:27.218 --> 21:30.721
I think I'd just like
to be by myself right now.

21:30.788 --> 21:32.322
Sammy, I-I'm sorry.

21:32.389 --> 21:34.858
It's just that you
caught me by surprise.

21:34.926 --> 21:36.844
Yeah, well, imagine
how it caught me

21:36.911 --> 21:39.780
when, on the morning
of August 12, 1989,

21:39.848 --> 21:42.916
I looked in the sink and...

21:42.984 --> 21:46.219
I'm sorry, I thought
I could talk about it.

21:51.726 --> 21:53.593
Sam, Sam.

21:53.661 --> 21:56.163
Sammy, it's, it's okay.

21:56.231 --> 21:57.921
So you're blowing
your feathers.

21:57.932 --> 22:00.200
It's not the end of the world.

22:00.201 --> 22:01.134
Sure.

22:01.135 --> 22:02.519
You know, there's a lot more

22:02.587 --> 22:05.705
to Sam Malone
than just your great hair.

22:05.773 --> 22:06.823
Really?

22:06.890 --> 22:07.991
Of course.

22:08.058 --> 22:09.676
You're a great guy.

22:09.743 --> 22:11.311
Handsome, sweet...

22:11.379 --> 22:13.130
Oh, don't say "sweet."

22:13.198 --> 22:15.215
What's the matter with sweet?

22:15.283 --> 22:17.183
It's another way
of saying bald.

22:18.586 --> 22:20.354
Sam, Sam, I-I mean it.

22:20.421 --> 22:23.123
You are a terrific, sweet guy.

22:23.190 --> 22:25.959
I mean, anybody who would
do what you just did

22:26.027 --> 22:31.397
to make someone feel better
is the best friend in the world.

22:31.465 --> 22:34.150
You don't think any less of me?

22:34.218 --> 22:36.402
Think any less of me?

22:36.470 --> 22:38.054
Oh...
