NARRATOR: What does the Mirror show you?

00:40.916 --> 00:42.793
What do you see?

00:46.713 --> 00:48.636
An oft told tale.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.220
(MEN SHOUTING)

00:53.887 --> 00:55.309
That of Snow White,

00:56.223 --> 00:59.648
how she vanquished the evil Queen Ravenna

01:00.769 --> 01:02.863
and took her rightful place on the throne.

01:09.278 --> 01:14.580
But there is another story,
one you have not yet seen.

01:16.326 --> 01:21.253
One that comes long before
"happily ever after."

01:56.074 --> 01:57.326
A mere pawn?

01:58.285 --> 02:01.380
A humble pawn can bring down kingdoms.

02:04.875 --> 02:05.876

Stop distracting me.

(RAVENNA CHUCKLES)

02:15.844 --> 02:19.849
Poor little pawn. Mean old king.

02:20.349 --> 02:22.067
So sad.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.402
But the final say...

02:27.064 --> 02:28.361
Well...

02:30.192 --> 02:33.947
Queen will have that.

(BELLS TOLLING)

03:37.884 --> 03:40.307
NARRATOR: With the Mirror at her command,

03:40.470 --> 03:43.474
Ravenna was invincible.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.288
She took her kingdom
as she had taken others before it,

03:59.072 --> 04:04.039
and as she would take others again,
with her sister Freya at her side.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.012
RAVENNA: Is it love?

04:23.638 --> 04:24.581
Truly?

04:24.681 --> 04:27.685
It is love, truly. Your move.

04:28.226 --> 04:31.880

Queen to rook five. Checkmate in three.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.372
(EXHALES)

04:49.790 --> 04:52.919
Learn from loss, Freya,
and your day will come.

04:53.835 --> 04:58.052
Your possibilities will be endless
once the magic awakens in your heart.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.643
It won't. We both know it won't.
I'm not like you.

05:03.678 --> 05:07.023
All the women of our blood
are gifted, Freya.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.316
And in time

05:08.475 --> 05:12.525
you will find the source
of your power as I found mine.

05:12.687 --> 05:13.904
We'll see.

05:18.902 --> 05:19.903
What?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.699
You're carrying his child.

05:27.786 --> 05:28.787
Oh.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.041
You didn't know.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.113
Well, he's promised to another.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.614
He does not love her.

05:39.714 --> 05:43.093
Their engagement is sealed.
It cannot be broken.

05:44.302 --> 05:46.304
He will deny you.

05:46.429 --> 05:49.308
And he will deny your daughter.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.777
He will not.

05:53.812 --> 05:54.938
Freya,

05:56.439 --> 05:58.112
I'm not being cruel.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.743
I simply wish to protect you.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.870
You may be surprised how things turn out.

06:06.658 --> 06:09.161
You know much, Ravenna.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.463
But you do not know all.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.883
I'm afraid I do.

06:30.557 --> 06:33.356
NARRATOR:
Freya did not believe her sister,

06:33.518 --> 06:36.738
for love blinds even the clearest eye.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.530
And when her daughter
was but a few weeks old,

06:41.860 --> 06:44.864
Freya's trusting heart
was rewarded at last.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.366
(EXHALES)

06:49.826 --> 06:51.812
Her lover had sent word.

06:51.912 --> 06:55.398
He would defy his family
and marry Freya in secret,

06:55.498 --> 06:57.421
in the Royal Garden.

06:58.919 --> 07:04.508
They would gather their child and flee
the kingdom to begin a life of their own.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.671
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

08:26.923 --> 08:30.493
NARRATOR: Consumed by grief
and anger, Freya left her sister

08:30.593 --> 08:34.972
to seek a kingdom of her own
in the land far to the north.

08:35.597 --> 08:40.320
There, the people would
come to fear her very name.

08:40.477 --> 08:42.446
SOLDIER: Burn it down! Kill them all!

08:44.149 --> 08:48.070
NARRATOR: For if she could not
raise a child, then in its place

08:48.194 --> 08:49.571
she would raise an army.

Freya turned the once-green farmlands

09:40.413 --> 09:43.917

There she built her fortress,

Tull.

11:47.749 --> 11:48.750
(WINCING)

11:49.751 --> 11:52.595
Love is a lie.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.283
It is a trick played by the cruel

11:57.383 --> 11:59.536
on the foolish and the weak.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.704
Cast it from your mind.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.728
Never let it render you frail of mind

12:04.891 --> 12:09.522
or of will, because in my kingdom,
there is but one law.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.528
Do not love.

12:16.486 --> 12:20.332
It's a sin, and I'll not forgive it.

12:21.616 --> 12:22.617
(GASPING)

12:23.785 --> 12:27.105
Now, let's hear no more
of family and love.

12:27.205 --> 12:29.816
Those illusions are beneath you.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.402
I have freed you from them.

12:32.502 --> 12:37.508
And in exchange for this precious gift,
I ask only one thing,

If you wear that always

she'll never know
what you're thinking either.

27:30.315 --> 27:31.862
Show yourself!

27:32.693 --> 27:34.036
RAVENNA: Kill...

27:41.910 --> 27:44.914
Kill for me.

28:32.419 --> 28:34.421
(MOANING)

28:42.638 --> 28:45.312
Don't just stand there, do something!

28:46.433 --> 28:48.151
(GRUNTING)

28:49.645 --> 28:50.646
(GRUNTING)

29:02.991 --> 29:04.163
You're mad, man.

29:04.368 --> 29:07.998
Aye, I wanted it an inch higher
but the wind is tricky out here.

29:10.832 --> 29:11.958
What have we got?

29:12.793 --> 29:14.670
Well, that is exquisite.

29:19.841 --> 29:20.842
Oops.

29:21.385 --> 29:23.537
- You have no right.
- I have every right.

29:23.637 --> 29:24.638
These are my woods.

29:25.430 --> 29:28.125
These are the queen's woods.
I have a royal permit.

29:28.225 --> 29:30.252
For deer, maybe, but not fawns.

29:30.352 --> 29:32.171
That one there was just a few weeks old.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.899
Like the three others you killed
that I found at your camp.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.612
- It's beautiful. Do you mind?
- What? No.

29:42.239 --> 29:43.974
- Release my horse.
- No, no, no.

29:44.074 --> 29:45.542
I'm keeping the horse as payment.

29:45.701 --> 29:46.873
- Payment for what?
- For the arrow.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.709
It's not like they grow on trees.

29:50.497 --> 29:53.546
Well, technically they do,
but not the pointy bit there.

29:54.042 --> 29:56.320
- (SCREAMS)
- (LAUGHING)

29:56.420 --> 29:58.047
That's all yours.

29:58.547 --> 29:59.639
(GASPING IN PAIN)

29:59.965 --> 30:02.218
You will pay, commoner.

30:02.884 --> 30:06.013
I shall tell the queen and the queen
will have your head.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.732
- Queen Snow White?
- Yes.

30:09.057 --> 30:10.058
Snow White.

30:10.642 --> 30:11.734
(LAUGHING) Hyah!

31:01.443 --> 31:02.945
SOLDIER: Fan out!

31:04.112 --> 31:05.989
Line the flanks!

31:09.618 --> 31:11.541
See you later, love.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.045
(HORSES WHINNYING)

31:19.294 --> 31:20.320
Your Majesty.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.343
Please, my friend.

31:23.465 --> 31:26.451
If this is about the horse, I can explain.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.428
Horse? What horse?

31:29.054 --> 31:30.397
Never mind.

31:31.306 --> 31:32.398
How'd you find me?

31:32.557 --> 31:33.809
It wasn't easy.

31:35.811 --> 31:36.687
Nion.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.107
- You swore.
- NION: Yeah, well,

31:40.232 --> 31:42.951
he threatened to put me in a big pot.

31:43.110 --> 31:45.679
Nonsense. We paid him three gold.

31:45.779 --> 31:47.201
ERIC: Oh, three? Is that all?

31:48.156 --> 31:50.454
Three each.

31:50.617 --> 31:52.210
- Who are you?
- Gryff.

31:52.369 --> 31:53.495
At your service.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.664
Bonds, rewards, debt collection.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.708
- I'm his brother.
- Half-brother.

31:57.874 --> 31:59.217
BOTH: Same mum.

32:00.710 --> 32:02.212
Walk with me.

32:06.675 --> 32:08.493
I've come on a matter of grave importance.

32:08.593 --> 32:11.187
You should find some gravely
important people, then.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.974
The Mirror is gone.

32:16.017 --> 32:18.566
We believed its dark magic
died with Ravenna.

32:19.396 --> 32:20.943
We were wrong.

32:21.648 --> 32:25.027
There is an evil within the Mirror
that has only grown in power.

32:25.944 --> 32:29.139
And Queen Snow White has vowed
to rid her kingdom of it

32:29.239 --> 32:31.367
before its darkness cannot be stopped.

32:31.700 --> 32:32.952
(SCREAMING)

32:34.453 --> 32:36.646
Two weeks ago, the queen ordered
a detachment of soldiers

32:36.746 --> 32:37.981
to take the Mirror to Sanctuary.

32:38.081 --> 32:39.274
They never returned.

32:39.374 --> 32:41.193
Wait, wait. I'm not your man.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.261
You're the best tracker
we have in the kingdom.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.280
And as you say, the Mirror is evil

32:45.380 --> 32:47.366
and it mustn't fall into the hands
of the wrong person.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.826
And Snow White thinks
I'm the one to find it?

32:49.926 --> 32:52.520
She commands you to find it.

32:52.679 --> 32:56.600
And to deliver it to Sanctuary, where its
wickedness can forever be contained.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.420
Do you accept or not?

33:00.520 --> 33:03.048
Yes, yes, yes. He accepts.

33:03.148 --> 33:04.400
Provided there's a reward.

33:05.567 --> 33:07.444
I don't want no reward.

33:09.779 --> 33:10.780
Eric.

33:12.449 --> 33:13.951
Snow White is unwell.

33:15.952 --> 33:17.249
The Mirror...

33:17.996 --> 33:20.107
She said she couldn't stop looking at it.

33:20.207 --> 33:23.177
She could hear its voice calling for her.

33:24.544 --> 33:25.636
That's why she sent it away.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.032
What was that thing?

33:52.239 --> 33:55.058
Move all your forces
to the northern border.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.751
Why? What do you know?

33:57.410 --> 33:59.271
Freya, Queen of the North.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.214
That owl was her spy.

34:01.373 --> 34:02.941
Now she knows about the Mirror.

34:03.041 --> 34:06.403
And if she finds it, everything
we hold dear will be covered in ice.

34:06.503 --> 34:07.504
Move your men to the north.

34:09.672 --> 34:10.764
(HORSE NEIGHING)

34:16.346 --> 34:17.563
What are you two still doing here?

34:17.722 --> 34:19.224
We're your partners.

34:19.391 --> 34:20.688
No, you're not.

34:22.101 --> 34:23.853
I am Snow White's man as well.

34:24.020 --> 34:26.648
I mean, dwarf.
If she's in trouble, I wanna help!

34:33.154 --> 34:35.907
My queen, Vardhelm has fallen.

34:36.699 --> 34:38.476
It was the last stronghold.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.420
The entire White Lands are yours.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.206
You've won.

34:43.873 --> 34:45.250
Have I?

34:52.257 --> 34:54.179
The game's not finished.

35:10.233 --> 35:13.112
Is this where the world ends,
or is there more?

35:13.737 --> 35:16.331
My queen, the South cannot be conquered.

35:16.489 --> 35:18.808
Snow White's lands are too vast,
her armies are too...

35:18.908 --> 35:21.457
Did you know that Eric was alive?

35:22.871 --> 35:24.214
Did you?

35:26.207 --> 35:27.192
How?

35:27.292 --> 35:28.276
I swear to you.

35:28.376 --> 35:29.923
- I threw his body in...
- That's all right.

35:30.587 --> 35:32.760
I prefer it this way.

35:32.922 --> 35:35.220
There's something that he seeks.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.261
I want it.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.643
My sister's mirror.

35:41.181 --> 35:42.933
It holds great power.

35:43.099 --> 35:45.898
And with it at my command,
I can do great things.

35:46.728 --> 35:49.506
I will free every child.

35:49.606 --> 35:51.508
I will save them all.

35:51.608 --> 35:52.951
As I saved you.

35:54.110 --> 35:58.410
And my army of Huntsmen will grow
until nothing will stand in its path.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.997
So, you see, the game is not finished.

36:05.538 --> 36:07.131
Prepare the Huntsmen.

36:08.958 --> 36:09.959
Oh.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.178
Oh. Huntsman.

36:12.462 --> 36:13.463
Hmm?

36:14.339 --> 36:16.307
- What?
- How much further?

36:17.175 --> 36:18.267
How much further?

36:18.718 --> 36:21.288
What? To the place I'm looking
for that I don't know where it is?

36:21.388 --> 36:22.435
It's hard to say.

36:23.056 --> 36:25.559
This one's had a strop on since we left.

36:45.620 --> 36:46.813
They came through here.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.023
Well, obviously.

36:48.123 --> 36:50.834
This takes us to the northern road.
Leads direct to Sanctuary.

36:51.418 --> 36:53.045
Don't need to be a Huntsman to know that.

36:53.962 --> 36:56.135
Hey, Nion, who am I?

36:56.923 --> 36:58.325
Ooh.

36:58.425 --> 37:02.020
I'm talking to the dirt.
I hear it speak to me.

37:02.303 --> 37:03.913
He's actually quite good at this, Gryff.

37:04.013 --> 37:05.790
Get stuffed. He's a buffoon.

37:05.890 --> 37:06.891
- Well...
- We ride north.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.061
Actually, they headed west.

37:11.104 --> 37:13.732
The northern road cuts through a plain.
Nowhere to take cover.

37:14.399 --> 37:17.135
The western road runs next to a forest.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.578
That's where they would've made camp.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.239
That's where we're going to find them.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.624
- Obviously...
- (SHUSHING)

37:23.074 --> 37:25.748
- The dirt is talking to me again.
- What's it saying?

37:25.910 --> 37:28.605
He's saying the mouthy one's an idiot

37:28.705 --> 37:31.650
who wouldn't last a day on his own,
and should go home.

37:31.750 --> 37:32.751
I agree.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.926
I'm not going home till I get my reward.

37:37.547 --> 37:40.175
You want gold, but all you're going
to find out here is death.

37:40.508 --> 37:43.244
(SCOFFS) A bit dramatic.

37:43.344 --> 37:44.621
Dramatic, yeah, unless it's true,

37:44.721 --> 37:47.019
and then we should consider it
an accurate warning, I think.

37:48.516 --> 37:51.169
I know I'm not afraid
of Freya of the Frost.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.943
Oy. Not so loud. Keep your voice down.

37:54.939 --> 37:57.283
You're even more stupid than I thought.

Bloody hell.

Who would've attacked them
out here in the open?

38:49.244 --> 38:50.937
Keep your eyes peeled.
They could still be around.

38:51.037 --> 38:53.231
Look for tracks, blood trails...

39:39.043 --> 39:42.426
These are their own arrows,
their own blades.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.888
They killed each other.

39:46.342 --> 39:47.577
But why?

39:47.677 --> 39:49.554
These are all the queen's men.

40:07.363 --> 40:08.785
The Mirror was here.

40:15.663 --> 40:16.664
(GRUNTS)

40:22.754 --> 40:24.882
Well, this is definitely
not one of theirs.

40:26.591 --> 40:29.077
I grew up in the mines.

40:29.177 --> 40:31.020
That's worth half the world.

40:32.055 --> 40:34.433
Whoever it belongs to has the Mirror.

40:37.602 --> 40:39.775
We need to find it before Freya does.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.452
What's this?

40:53.451 --> 40:55.328
We have to get off the road.

41:03.878 --> 41:05.926
See if he knows something.

41:08.758 --> 41:10.055
Bit quiet. You all right?

41:11.678 --> 41:13.100
Fine. You all right?

41:14.013 --> 41:15.811
Yeah, I'm all right.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.906
I'm looking for information.

41:24.565 --> 41:26.067
You'll not get much for that.

41:29.404 --> 41:33.099
Well, there was a wee massacre
on the road not far from here.

41:33.199 --> 41:34.893
The queen's soldiers.
You know anything about that?

41:34.993 --> 41:36.711
Yeah, they passed through here
a few days ago.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.830
- They did?
- Didn't stop. Weren't thirsty.

41:39.122 --> 41:41.045
Was anyone following them or...

41:47.964 --> 41:49.637
I'll have a pint as well.

42:03.563 --> 42:05.110
(STUTTERING)

42:05.440 --> 42:06.612
I'll take that as a "no."

Good day.

42:10.611 --> 42:11.612
(CLEARS THROAT)

42:16.868 --> 42:18.996
Bit choosy for what she's offering.

Perhaps you'd have better luck
with your own kind.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.426
- No, I can't say I have.

Horrifying's the best of them.

Uh, generally by accident.

Too little light.

- No. No, I'm not having it.
- (SHUSHING) Aye.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.398
You ought to hold your tongue,
mate, before you lose it.

43:24.977 --> 43:26.087
Is that so?

43:26.187 --> 43:28.485
You know, if it was just me,
I wouldn't be worried.

43:29.190 --> 43:33.136
If it was me and him, I'd be a tiny bit
worried, because he's a bit of a waster.

43:33.236 --> 43:34.237
Not true.

43:34.403 --> 43:36.997
But none of that matters,
because we're with him.

43:38.241 --> 43:41.290
And he will gut you like a deer
quicker than you can blink.

43:41.452 --> 43:45.256
Because this man here,
this man is the Huntsman.

43:45.915 --> 43:47.508
Is this true?

Are you the Huntsman?

43:51.629 --> 43:54.098
- That's me.
- Well...

43:56.092 --> 43:57.844
The thing of it is...

44:01.556 --> 44:02.648
We're all Huntsmen.

44:04.058 --> 44:06.436
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

44:07.687 --> 44:08.688
(GRUNTING)

44:28.416 --> 44:29.776
Wait, wait, wait.

44:29.876 --> 44:31.128
Can we not talk about this?

45:00.990 --> 45:03.334
You call yourself a Huntsman?

45:04.660 --> 45:08.164
I expected more from a man who had
the courage to betray his queen.

45:08.998 --> 45:10.817
And for what?

45:10.917 --> 45:12.985
For the love of some spineless woman?

45:13.085 --> 45:14.086
(GRUNTS)

45:20.051 --> 45:24.393
Maybe you were something in your day,
brother, but that day is long gone.

45:29.518 --> 45:30.690
Have you made your peace?

45:31.020 --> 45:33.364
(LAUGHS) I'll have it soon enough.

45:34.023 --> 45:36.259
Tell Freya I died a free man.

45:36.359 --> 45:38.111
Freya doesn't care how you die.

45:40.446 --> 45:42.119
No one cares.

45:43.324 --> 45:44.826
You're already forgotten.

47:14.290 --> 47:15.291

47:17.668 --> 47:19.136
I tied you up.

47:19.712 --> 47:21.405
She his wife or something?

47:21.505 --> 47:23.348
No. Can't be. His wife's dead.

47:24.383 --> 47:25.726
Dead?

47:26.969 --> 47:29.063
Is that what you told everyone?

47:29.930 --> 47:33.525
You poor, heartbroken widower.

47:34.185 --> 47:37.439
That story must've wet the eyes
of many a young lass.

47:38.439 --> 47:40.316
Maybe more than their eyes.

47:41.567 --> 47:43.761
No, no... No, you're dead.

47:43.861 --> 47:45.704
I saw you die.

47:46.489 --> 47:49.038
This is not real. This is not happening.

47:49.825 --> 47:51.748
- You're a ghost.
- (CHUCKLES)

47:51.994 --> 47:53.166
Or else I'm...

47:54.163 --> 47:56.666
Or else I'm dead.

47:57.041 --> 47:58.463
Am I not alive?

47:58.626 --> 47:59.923
You're alive.

48:00.127 --> 48:01.445
Although, you should be dead.

48:01.545 --> 48:03.322
You got hit on the head like, six...

48:03.422 --> 48:04.824
- What do you think, six or seven?
- Seven.

48:04.924 --> 48:06.176
Seven times. A lot.

48:06.967 --> 48:09.095
- So this is...
- Real.

48:10.471 --> 48:11.518
Very.

48:16.936 --> 48:19.030
Did you think I'd forget?

48:21.816 --> 48:23.864
Did you think I'd forgive?

48:26.195 --> 48:28.072
Stand or fall, you said.

48:28.823 --> 48:31.542
You'd never leave my side, you said.

48:32.993 --> 48:34.370
You swore it.

48:37.498 --> 48:39.525
And then you fled.

48:39.625 --> 48:42.048
I see you fight, and I see you run.

49:08.988 --> 49:11.662
No, Sara. That's not what happened.

49:11.782 --> 49:14.251
I saw Tull kill you.

49:14.410 --> 49:16.663
I saw him kill you, with my own eyes.
I would never leave you.

49:16.829 --> 49:19.503
But I saw you leave me, with my own eyes.

49:20.082 --> 49:22.777
And you, of all people, should know

49:22.877 --> 49:25.221
Tull could never kill me.

49:25.379 --> 49:26.655
Sara.

49:26.755 --> 49:28.382
- Don't.
- I swear to you.

49:28.549 --> 49:30.096
She put me in her dungeon.

49:30.259 --> 49:32.411
For seven years.

49:32.511 --> 49:36.015
And when I finally escaped,
I swore I'd find you.

49:36.182 --> 49:38.105
It's taken me a long time.

49:40.853 --> 49:42.730
But here we are.

Husband

49:46.650 --> 49:47.697

49:48.861 --> 49:52.866
You honestly believe this?
That I'd abandon you?

49:54.200 --> 49:55.201
Aye.

49:55.910 --> 49:56.957

50:10.132 --> 50:12.180

should have said something.

50:12.384 --> 50:13.385
Mmm-hmm.

50:13.594 --> 50:18.145
She's got two more
little ones in her left boot.

50:19.683 --> 50:21.310
It's no longer important.

50:22.811 --> 50:26.315
If your face is the last thing
that I'm meant to see,

50:26.482 --> 50:28.200
then I'm grateful.

52:02.286 --> 52:03.538
(CHUCKLES)

52:07.916 --> 52:11.216
So, what happens
if Freya gets this mirror?

52:13.380 --> 52:17.639
Don't you think that you and me
have other things to discuss, like us?

52:17.801 --> 52:18.802
No.

52:19.762 --> 52:21.105
What happens?

52:23.932 --> 52:25.605
She'd be unstoppable.

52:30.689 --> 52:31.690
(WHISTLES)

52:32.775 --> 52:33.867
Where's my horse?

52:33.984 --> 52:35.327
I sent it off.

52:36.070 --> 52:37.429
What did you do that for?

52:37.529 --> 52:39.390
No horses, no tracks.

52:39.490 --> 52:41.663
We keep off the road, out of sight.

52:42.076 --> 52:44.478
(CHUCKLES) So you're coming with me, then?

52:44.578 --> 52:47.001
No, you're coming with me.

52:47.498 --> 52:50.067
Yeah, whatever you need
to tell yourself, that's fine.

52:50.167 --> 52:53.546
From what I can see, your wee band
won't do too well without me.

52:53.837 --> 52:55.072
- Huh?
- No...

52:55.172 --> 52:59.034
SARA: Whatever power this mirror
contains, I'll not let Freya wield it.

52:59.134 --> 53:01.808
We'll find it, and we'll bring it
to the Sanctuary.

53:02.346 --> 53:04.098
And then you and I

53:04.223 --> 53:06.066
will part forever.

53:07.059 --> 53:08.231
Now.

53:08.852 --> 53:10.445
Tell me about this.

53:14.316 --> 53:16.410
- What do you think?
- About what?

53:16.860 --> 53:18.971
The woman. Do you trust her?

53:19.071 --> 53:22.575
Well, I mean, I don't think
we've got much of a choice.

53:23.075 --> 53:25.419
Besides, she's pretty good in a scrap.

53:25.577 --> 53:28.105
I imagine that would come
in handy before too long.

53:28.205 --> 53:30.399
We'll hit Callan Crossing by nightfall.

53:30.499 --> 53:32.376
There's a market there.
They might have sold the Mirror.

53:32.835 --> 53:35.362
Tracking never was one
of your strengths, was it?

53:35.462 --> 53:38.032
I cannae wait to find out what yours is.

53:38.132 --> 53:39.783
If an enemy uses diamonds for arrows,

53:39.883 --> 53:42.036
I doubt they need to sell
the Mirror for money.

53:42.136 --> 53:44.038
Well, if you don't like my plan,
you can piss off.

53:44.138 --> 53:46.140
That is charming!

53:46.473 --> 53:48.876
And you can piss off, too,
as you so eloquently put it,

53:48.976 --> 53:50.649
but that's not gonna get rid of me.

53:51.478 --> 53:52.946
You're still my wife.

53:56.316 --> 53:58.865
Look, we were deceived.

53:59.403 --> 54:01.138
The ice wall that Freya put between us,

54:01.238 --> 54:03.332
she showed us what she wanted us to see.

54:06.326 --> 54:07.373
Wait.

54:08.036 --> 54:09.504
And what if I'm right?

54:10.998 --> 54:12.420
Do we not deserve that chance?

54:13.333 --> 54:15.176
It wouldn't matter.

54:15.294 --> 54:16.341
You'd leave again.

54:17.379 --> 54:19.698
We blind ourselves to the truth
because we're weak,

54:19.798 --> 54:21.492
because we hope.

54:21.592 --> 54:23.390
But there's no hope for love.

Love ends in betrayal.

their armor is made of gold.

Not far.

01:16:56.821 --> 01:16:58.243
End it now.

01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:02.164
Have you been true?

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.461
(CHITTERING)

01:17:36.443 --> 01:17:37.945
(HORSES APPROACHING)

01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:01.932
GRYFF: Huntsman, what is this?

01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:04.389
Stand tall, brother.

01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:10.060
(HORSE NEIGHING)

01:18:14.064 --> 01:18:15.281
(ROARING)

01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:41.054
FREYA: Eric.

01:18:42.468 --> 01:18:43.936
My Eric.

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:47.182
Your queen has missed you.

01:18:48.432 --> 01:18:50.400
You're not my queen, Freya.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.796
But I'm forever your queen.

01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:56.024
Isn't that right, Sara?

01:18:57.441 --> 01:19:00.911
You see, you abandoned her, Eric.

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:03.448
But not I.

01:19:05.157 --> 01:19:07.751
I raised her from despair.

01:19:08.702 --> 01:19:12.002
Made her the point of my spear,
my tempered steel.

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:15.526
She's laid waste to kingdoms

01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:18.926
and brought men such
as you to their knees.

01:19:20.339 --> 01:19:22.683
She's everything that you're not.

01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:27.288
All I had to do was send her to you,
and you led her straight to the Mirror.

01:19:27.388 --> 01:19:29.061
It's pathetic.

01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:32.355
(WHISPERS) Oh, what are these?

01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:34.399
Dwarves.

01:19:36.397 --> 01:19:37.990
(LAUGHING) They're just like children.

01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:40.071
We're mighty far from children,
Bitch Queen.

01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:45.952
Adorable.

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:48.788
Bring me the Mirror.

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:50.203
You'll have to kill me first!

01:19:51.745 --> 01:19:54.248
No, I won't.

01:19:57.376 --> 01:19:58.673
NION: Doreena, no!

01:20:01.922 --> 01:20:03.924
You knew, didn't you?

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:07.811
You knew she'd betray you
and you spared her still.

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:19.072
Have you learnt my lesson at last?

01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:22.384
Harden your heart, Queen of Winter.

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:24.220
Bury the world in a tomb of ice.

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:25.492
It matters not.

01:20:26.363 --> 01:20:27.831
Love will endure.

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:31.702
Yes, perhaps you're right.

01:20:33.912 --> 01:20:35.334
Shall we find out?

01:20:43.213 --> 01:20:44.715
(IN SOFT VOICE) Kill him.

01:21:43.524 --> 01:21:44.901
Is he dead?

01:21:45.317 --> 01:21:46.660
I think so.

01:21:47.361 --> 01:21:48.783
What do we do?

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:51.240
Pull it out.

01:21:52.491 --> 01:21:53.743
Go on.

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:57.646
One, two...

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:58.731
Quickly!

01:21:58.831 --> 01:22:00.424
- (GRUNTS)
- (BOTH SCREAMING)

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:05.675
Bloody hell, that hurt.

01:22:06.505 --> 01:22:08.428
I don't believe it! She missed!

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:17.395
She never misses.

01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:19.734
MRS. BROMWYN: Have you lost your mind?

01:22:20.644 --> 01:22:22.463
She betrayed us.

01:22:22.563 --> 01:22:24.941
Eric, she is not Cupid.

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:28.969
I doubt that an arrow to the chest
is an expression of her love.

01:22:29.069 --> 01:22:30.070
No, no, no.

01:22:30.821 --> 01:22:33.265
There is a grand design
at work here, friends.

01:22:33.365 --> 01:22:35.459
And it grows even louder.

01:22:37.119 --> 01:22:39.121
Head injury. Number eight.

01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:42.667
She never misses.

01:22:51.008 --> 01:22:52.885
Look, I am twice as angry as you are.

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:57.915
Doreena was the only friend I had in
this world, but you need to face facts.

01:22:58.015 --> 01:22:59.892
Sara is not on your side.

01:23:00.517 --> 01:23:03.270
I don't need you to
believe what I believe.

01:23:03.854 --> 01:23:05.151
What are these for, exactly?

01:23:09.109 --> 01:23:10.594
I'll give you a hint.

01:23:10.694 --> 01:23:12.947
- We're not gonna carry them on our backs.
- (CHUCKLING)

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:16.934
So, what are you gonna do?
Trek all the way to the frozen North?

01:23:17.034 --> 01:23:19.457
Face down an evil sorceress
and her entire army?

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:21.246
Aye.

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:25.000
All right, I'm in!

01:23:56.365 --> 01:24:00.165
Tull, put the dwarves in the gallery
and bring the Mirror to my sanctum.

01:24:05.582 --> 01:24:08.210
Welcome home, Sara.

01:24:33.986 --> 01:24:35.829
RAVENNA: Freya.

01:24:38.156 --> 01:24:39.783
Come to me.

01:24:45.831 --> 01:24:48.835
Say the words.

01:24:52.129 --> 01:24:55.699
Speak the words.

01:24:55.799 --> 01:24:58.222
FREYA: "The age can be wicked

01:24:58.885 --> 01:25:01.388
"to those who walk alone.

01:25:03.056 --> 01:25:05.834
"When I look into the Mirror,

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:08.983
"I see myself as I might become."

01:25:11.815 --> 01:25:13.567
RAVENNA: Yes.

01:25:15.152 --> 01:25:17.075
Yes.

01:25:18.822 --> 01:25:21.951
Mirror, Mirror on the wall,

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:26.125
who is the fairest of them all?

01:25:28.665 --> 01:25:29.666
(RUMBLING)

01:26:48.787 --> 01:26:51.415
Do not back away from me.

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:54.836
You asked a question.

01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:57.429
The Mirror has answered.

01:26:58.046 --> 01:27:00.174
Ravenna, how?

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:03.055
Are you not dead?

01:27:03.218 --> 01:27:04.390
Yes.

01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:07.602
No.

01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:12.695
Something in between.

01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:17.615
You've become quite literal, Freya.

01:27:18.567 --> 01:27:20.661
Of all people, you should know

01:27:21.987 --> 01:27:25.082
that is but a vessel.

01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:28.623
I left my body.

01:27:29.578 --> 01:27:31.672
I went into the Mirror.

01:27:32.581 --> 01:27:34.583
And there I stayed.

01:27:35.959 --> 01:27:38.007
I became part of it.

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.137
Trapped.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.842
Until you released me.

01:27:48.597 --> 01:27:51.225
We have much to do, little sister.

01:27:51.975 --> 01:27:55.003
With you and your army by my side,

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:57.822
I will regain my kingdom once more.

01:27:59.149 --> 01:28:01.510
Snow White

01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:04.033
shall kneel before me.

01:28:04.196 --> 01:28:05.197
(CLINKING)

01:28:07.407 --> 01:28:10.035
She will beg for mercy.

01:28:11.745 --> 01:28:14.419
And then I'll tear her heart out.

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:23.928
MRS. BROMWYN:
Oh, that's a bit bigger than I imagined.

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.393
GRYFF: So what's the plan?

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:30.351
You have got a plan?

01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:32.098
Aye.

01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:33.688
Is it any good?

01:28:34.351 --> 01:28:35.398
No.

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:37.270
But it's simple.

01:28:37.854 --> 01:28:40.882
Freya will be in her sanctum,
below the steeple.

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:44.361
I'll make my way down from the top,
find her, and kill her.

01:28:44.569 --> 01:28:46.162
What about Nion and Doreena?

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:49.165
I've got someone on the inside
who's gonna help me find them.

01:28:49.741 --> 01:28:50.958
- Who?
- You.

01:28:53.245 --> 01:28:55.998
You have given my Huntsmen new orders.

01:28:57.749 --> 01:28:59.001
Better orders.

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:02.946
We will attack tomorrow in two waves.

01:29:03.046 --> 01:29:04.322
Flanking maneuver.

01:29:04.422 --> 01:29:06.345
I presumed you would agree.

01:29:06.508 --> 01:29:08.806
It's a far superior tactic.

01:29:08.969 --> 01:29:10.562
This is my kingdom.

01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:13.473
- Did you say something?
- This is my kingdom!

01:29:14.975 --> 01:29:16.773
Of course it is.

01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:20.238
And it always will be.

01:29:21.314 --> 01:29:24.284
I would never question my sister's rule.

01:29:25.277 --> 01:29:28.201
But beyond these walls

01:29:29.823 --> 01:29:31.370
is my kingdom.

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.963
My dominion.

01:29:39.082 --> 01:29:41.710
Do not forget what you owe me.

01:29:42.377 --> 01:29:44.721
I made you what you are.

01:29:50.969 --> 01:29:53.973
MAN: Come on. Move along. Faster.

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:56.233
Follow your brother.

01:30:01.563 --> 01:30:03.110
Look lively now.

01:30:04.608 --> 01:30:06.656
You as well. Go on.

01:30:07.611 --> 01:30:08.954
Shut it.

01:30:09.613 --> 01:30:12.082
Stop sniveling. Twerp.

01:30:14.534 --> 01:30:15.751
MRS. BROMWYN: Keep walking.

01:30:16.328 --> 01:30:17.830
Just keep walking.

01:30:31.426 --> 01:30:33.829
It's not my sister's fault, my lord.

01:30:33.929 --> 01:30:37.229
She was hit in the face
as a baby with a rock.

01:30:40.644 --> 01:30:41.896
You two, come with me.

01:30:55.075 --> 01:30:56.122
(GRUNTING)

01:31:04.501 --> 01:31:06.674
- Did you have to hit him so hard?
- Shut up.

01:31:12.008 --> 01:31:13.009
(GRUNTING)

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:16.805
He's very heavy.

01:31:18.264 --> 01:31:19.265
Right.

01:31:19.849 --> 01:31:22.648
We stuff him in here, we cover our tracks.

01:31:32.737 --> 01:31:34.410
That's very sloppy work, that is.

01:31:38.076 --> 01:31:39.077
(GRUNTING)

01:33:15.799 --> 01:33:16.800
PIPPA: Stop.

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:31.523
You don't remember me, do you?

01:33:34.859 --> 01:33:35.860
No.

01:33:38.363 --> 01:33:40.081
This is my war face.

01:33:42.367 --> 01:33:43.539
Pippa.

01:33:47.205 --> 01:33:49.173
I know why you're here.

01:33:56.172 --> 01:33:57.469
Aim true.

01:33:58.258 --> 01:34:00.010
My children.

This is the day for which...

01:34:05.723 --> 01:34:07.896
For which you were born.

01:34:09.727 --> 01:34:12.922
You will face an army of men
who have never lost a war,

01:34:13.022 --> 01:34:14.490
men who have...

01:34:18.945 --> 01:34:20.162
Who have forgotten...

...what it means to be afraid.

01:34:27.662 --> 01:34:30.256
We will bring fear

01:34:30.999 --> 01:34:32.717
once again

01:34:32.876 --> 01:34:34.027
to Snow White's army.

01:34:34.127 --> 01:34:35.820
And their lands will be mine.

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:37.422
And their children...

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:42.389
(WHISPERS) Their children...

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:48.683
For I am queen.

(IN LOUD VOICE) I am queen.

01:34:57.358 --> 01:34:59.886
This is what I trained you for.

01:34:59.986 --> 01:35:02.159
This is why I raised you.

01:35:06.784 --> 01:35:09.207
This is why I made you what you are.

01:35:18.755 --> 01:35:20.632
Hello, Eric.

Is this not your kingdom?

It is.

01:36:01.798 --> 01:36:04.051
Do you not have laws?

01:36:04.968 --> 01:36:06.220
I do.

Your old queen? Your new queen?

You broke the law.

01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:49.913
The law?

01:36:50.013 --> 01:36:52.290
Have you forgotten the ones who loved you?

01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:53.791
Your mothers, your fathers.

01:36:53.891 --> 01:36:55.359
What law did they break?

01:36:56.019 --> 01:36:57.754
Love does not make you weak.

01:36:57.854 --> 01:37:00.089
It's all that ever gave me strength.

01:37:00.189 --> 01:37:02.032
Tull, have we not fought side by side?

01:37:02.775 --> 01:37:03.776
We were children!

01:37:04.694 --> 01:37:06.822
Brothers and sisters.
Did we not love each other?

01:37:07.989 --> 01:37:09.015
Fight with me.

01:37:09.115 --> 01:37:11.538
If you die, you die
for something that's yours.

01:37:25.798 --> 01:37:27.825
Why do you turn away, Freya?

01:37:27.925 --> 01:37:29.619
You deceived us,
and now you deceive yourself.

01:37:29.719 --> 01:37:30.745
Silence.

01:37:30.845 --> 01:37:32.747
Why did you not kill us back then?

01:37:32.847 --> 01:37:35.191
Instead, you break my heart
and turn hers against me.

01:38:00.792 --> 01:38:01.793
(GRUNTS)

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.257
Pretty.

01:38:12.178 --> 01:38:13.771
You see, Huntsman,

01:38:15.431 --> 01:38:17.684
love doesn't save your life.

01:38:18.851 --> 01:38:20.194
I should know.

01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:27.744
I've been dead before.

01:38:29.278 --> 01:38:30.279

01:39:05.314 --> 01:39:06.315
I'm sorry.

01:39:06.983 --> 01:39:08.656
I'm so sorry.

01:39:10.153 --> 01:39:11.655
Stand or fall.

01:39:12.321 --> 01:39:13.322
Together.

01:39:29.672 --> 01:39:31.032
(TULL GRUNTS)

01:39:31.132 --> 01:39:32.805
- I stand with you.
- MAN: Aye.

01:39:32.967 --> 01:39:35.186
MEN: Aye.

01:39:36.179 --> 01:39:37.396
Don't.

01:39:49.734 --> 01:39:50.735
Stand back.

01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:55.539
Nothing can save you, Huntsman.

01:39:57.158 --> 01:39:58.626
All that's left is pain!

01:39:59.869 --> 01:40:01.542
(ALL GRUNTING)

01:40:04.081 --> 01:40:05.674
Ravenna, stop. Stop!

01:40:12.173 --> 01:40:13.345
Enough!

01:40:30.733 --> 01:40:31.780
We can't leave the Mirror.

01:40:32.777 --> 01:40:34.120
Then we climb.

01:40:35.738 --> 01:40:39.413
I thought I had driven
the weakness out of you.

01:40:40.159 --> 01:40:41.786
I thought I made you strong.

01:40:43.454 --> 01:40:46.333
But you're as pathetic as you ever were.

01:40:49.418 --> 01:40:50.419
(GRUNTING)

01:41:00.263 --> 01:41:01.856
Have you lost your mind?

01:41:05.101 --> 01:41:07.445
How did you make me strong?

01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:12.233
How did you draw the weakness out?

01:41:14.652 --> 01:41:15.653
What did you do?

01:41:18.781 --> 01:41:21.830
What did you do?

01:41:25.288 --> 01:41:28.462
I don't have to tell you anything.

01:41:28.958 --> 01:41:31.552
Oh. Oh, but you do.

01:41:32.211 --> 01:41:33.488
You see, you said it yourself,

01:41:33.588 --> 01:41:36.307
you're something between
this world and the Mirror.

01:41:37.049 --> 01:41:39.202
I summoned you out.

01:41:39.302 --> 01:41:42.330
Now you are bound to me!

01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:43.431
(GASPS)

01:41:43.681 --> 01:41:44.773
Tell me the truth.

01:41:47.184 --> 01:41:50.814
Mirror, Mirror on the wall...

01:41:52.023 --> 01:41:55.402
...who is the fairest of them all?

01:41:56.319 --> 01:41:58.471
You are, my queen.

01:41:58.571 --> 01:42:00.323
But not for long.

01:42:00.781 --> 01:42:04.644
Your sister holds a baby to her breast.

01:42:04.744 --> 01:42:05.996
A daughter.

01:42:06.495 --> 01:42:10.921
She will grow to be more
beautiful than even you.

01:42:17.965 --> 01:42:19.842
You cannot ask such a thing of me.

01:42:20.885 --> 01:42:23.079
I ask nothing.

01:42:23.179 --> 01:42:25.957
I am but a reflection.

01:42:26.057 --> 01:42:27.833
And you...

01:42:27.933 --> 01:42:30.732
You have already decided.

01:42:33.105 --> 01:42:34.573
RAVENNA: Kill.

01:42:36.859 --> 01:42:38.031
Kill.

Kill for me.

Yeah, I loved her.

01:43:19.110 --> 01:43:20.862
I loved you.

01:43:29.328 --> 01:43:31.251
That's why I'm stronger than you.

01:45:02.338 --> 01:45:03.840
I'm sorry

01:45:05.090 --> 01:45:06.808
I killed your daughter

01:45:07.843 --> 01:45:11.848
and released the greatest
power within you.

01:45:12.515 --> 01:45:16.565
A power you have wasted
on nothing but cheap sentiment!

01:45:17.311 --> 01:45:18.312
(GRUNTS)

01:45:18.896 --> 01:45:20.694
Did you not think I wanted a child?

01:45:21.315 --> 01:45:23.409
Did you not think I wanted love?

01:45:24.026 --> 01:45:27.913
But these things were not meant for me.

01:45:29.281 --> 01:45:31.500
I have a higher calling!

01:45:38.499 --> 01:45:40.422
Do you still believe

01:45:41.252 --> 01:45:44.051
that love conquers all?

01:45:45.005 --> 01:45:46.632
Maybe not all.

01:45:47.883 --> 01:45:48.884
Just you.

01:45:50.010 --> 01:45:51.637
Are you ready, Huntsman?

whose heart was broken in two.

01:49:08.167 --> 01:49:10.795
But even buried under ice and snow,

love survives.

and Snow White's kingdom
was safe from harm.
