NARRATOR: Previously on
Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles:

00:04.838 --> 00:07.548
You're stuck under the ocean
with one of those things.

00:07.716 --> 00:09.842
Don't worry about Queeg.
He's a good bloke.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.970
-He's not on our side.
-Why are we 300 miles off course?

00:13.138 --> 00:16.516
Our orders come from John Connor.
Deitz will retrieve a package.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.143
We will deliver this package
to Serrano Point.

00:19.311 --> 00:21.437
MAN:
Connor sent me. I've come for that.

00:21.605 --> 00:22.855
What's happening with you?

00:23.023 --> 00:24.941
CAMERON:
I've planted an explosive in my skull.

00:25.109 --> 00:27.652
-Cameron.
-I know. Riley's dead.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.779
-Cameron didn't do it.
-Can you be sure?

00:29.947 --> 00:32.615
-She told me.
-Just like she told you she loved you.

00:33.617 --> 00:34.992
JOHN:
You don't know anything.

[DEREK SIGHS]

00:41.291 --> 00:43.000
I'm really sorry, John.

00:46.380 --> 00:49.799
She was a good kid. She didn't deserve
what happened to her.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.178
Few people do.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.600
How long do you think
you could survive?

01:02.646 --> 01:04.731
With Cameron.

01:05.649 --> 01:09.694
If she wanted to kill you. Face to face.

01:12.698 --> 01:15.116
What kind of weapon do I have?

01:17.327 --> 01:19.412
Your fists.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.748
And your elbows.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.959
And your fingernails and your teeth.

01:25.127 --> 01:26.335
Against her...

01:27.838 --> 01:29.380
...those aren't weapons.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.674
No. They're not.

01:35.554 --> 01:38.347
You already know
the answer to that, John.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.434
If she wants me dead, I'm dead.

01:41.977 --> 01:44.145
If she wants you dead, you're dead.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.231
What are you getting at?

01:49.902 --> 01:52.653
I wanna talk about something.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.156
All right.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.703
-I wanna talk to you about the future.
-Yours?

02:02.039 --> 02:03.915
Yours.

02:59.721 --> 03:04.267
MAN [OVER RADIO]: Carter, this is ASDS.
Package is secure. Standing by for all-clear.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.935
Visual on the package, ASDS?

03:06.103 --> 03:07.395
Visual, aye, aye.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.192
-What the heck is that?
-It's Connor's box.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.028
-All we know?
-All we know.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.834
A little help?

03:31.879 --> 03:33.129
Captain?

03:35.048 --> 03:37.592
I will secure the package
in the magazine.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.177
Authorized access only.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.732
You wanna let us little people know
what's in the box?

03:52.900 --> 03:56.277
Or is it classified,
between you and Queeg?

03:56.445 --> 03:59.155
It's between Queeg and Queeg.
I don't know a damn thing.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.826
And that doesn't bother you?
Metal keeping secrets from skin.

04:04.578 --> 04:08.080
No. It doesn't. Not even a little.

04:08.248 --> 04:12.335
Well, it should.
And not just a little, but a lot.

04:13.045 --> 04:15.421
We were sent to pick up the box
and bring it back.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.132
So we're picking up the box
and bringing it back.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.760
And one of us should know why.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.512
One of us. Not just one of them.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.474
One of us knows.
His name is John Connor.

04:32.147 --> 04:34.273
You think those things work for us?

04:34.691 --> 04:38.235
Look around you. We work for them.

04:38.403 --> 04:42.198
Hauling ass through the worst
of Indian Country. And for what?

04:42.658 --> 04:44.784
To take a damn box back to Serrano?

04:44.952 --> 04:46.744
-Connor needs it.
-Connor?

04:46.912 --> 04:49.538
DIETZ: Connor is so into
his big chess match with Skynet...

04:49.706 --> 04:52.959
...he doesn't see how the tin cans
got us right where they want us.

04:53.377 --> 04:56.921
Metal on every base,
running the show in all but name.

04:57.381 --> 05:01.717
Just waiting to hit us all at once
with something big.

05:02.177 --> 05:05.388
Maybe something that's in that box.

05:05.555 --> 05:06.806
Break time is over.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.892
Those of you on watch,
get to your stations.

05:10.060 --> 05:14.230
Dietz, get to your rack. I don't wanna
see you till forenoon watch.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.817
"Yes, ma'am." That's what you say.

05:22.990 --> 05:26.283
You're a good sailor. But the pressure
is starting to get to you.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.285
Yeah?

05:28.453 --> 05:30.913
So, what's getting to you, ma'am?

[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES]

06:00.944 --> 06:02.319
You went to see the body.

06:05.157 --> 06:06.574
You shouldn't have done that.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.124
It was a risk. I know.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.378
I don't mean the risk.

06:23.759 --> 06:27.887
You shouldn't have to remember her
like that. That's all.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.939
There were things I needed to see.

06:40.484 --> 06:43.194
Things I had to understand.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.656
You understand them now?

06:48.950 --> 06:50.951
I think so.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.166
I'm sorry I doubted you.

06:58.835 --> 06:59.919
John--

07:00.420 --> 07:02.046
No.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.924
Not you. Her.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.579
We lost a day
evading the ASW bots near Fiji.

07:35.747 --> 07:38.207
We'll take a more direct route
to make up the time.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.000
Make sure the crew is prepared.

07:40.168 --> 07:45.172
Queeg, this crew can sneak through
the gates of hell and back if it has to.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.715
But they're not machines.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.969
They work better if they have a reason.

07:50.887 --> 07:54.098
If they know why you expect them
to perform miracles.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.724
This crew will do their job...

07:55.892 --> 07:59.562
...because that's what's required
to survive and complete the mission.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.021
You understand.

[ALARM BEEPING]

Unauthorized access to our cargo.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.709
Dietz, what the hell did you do?

08:21.877 --> 08:25.462
It could be anything in there.
A machine, a bomb. Anything.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.883
And we were just gonna run it
through the front door to Serrano.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.551
Now at least we know.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.553
-Of all the stupid things--
-Stupid?

08:32.721 --> 08:37.057
Stupid is taking their word for it.
For anything.

08:37.601 --> 08:40.227
-I'm not afraid of that thing.
-Then be afraid of me.

08:40.562 --> 08:41.604

08:43.773 --> 08:48.944
You spend any time in a work camp,

08:49.112 --> 08:51.405

-You don't get to tell me anything.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.866
And neither does the metal.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.202
Guys, look!

09:09.382 --> 09:10.758
-Metal.
-Deitz.

09:36.117 --> 09:39.453
I told you. This is what happens.
This is what they do.

09:39.621 --> 09:42.122
Pull his chip and make him tell us
what is going on.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.749
No.

We divide into search parties.

09:46.920 --> 09:51.340
We turn this boat over stem from stern
until we find that thing.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.925
We're gonna need guns.

09:53.176 --> 09:56.804
Commander Flores,
secure all sidearms and plasma rifles.

09:57.514 --> 10:02.851
Take Petty Officer Goodnow's body
to the cool room and return to duty.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.728
We continue as planned.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.710
That thing, you know what it is?

10:27.877 --> 10:29.461
-Yes.
-Then tell me.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.131
At least tell me.

10:33.633 --> 10:37.177
-Look, we're a team, right? You can tell--
-It's not your concern.

10:53.236 --> 10:56.572
We should just throw a rug down.
They'll never know the difference.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.283
Hey, I'm sorry it's come to this.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.329
-What, the moving?
-All of it.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.708
Well, I broke the rules.

11:09.419 --> 11:14.048
What was the name of that hippie town
we were in before Nebraska?

11:14.215 --> 11:16.258
-Garb-something.
-Garberville.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.510
Right. Wow, that was a culture shock.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.847
Going from hog farmers
and good old boys to...

11:22.015 --> 11:24.516
...pot growers
and kids named Sequoia.

11:25.310 --> 11:28.937
There was only one Sequoia.
There were three Sages, though.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.108
I felt bad for you when we left.

11:34.402 --> 11:37.780
You just started making friends,
fitting in.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.782
Fitting in?

11:39.949 --> 11:41.617
I was getting in fights every day.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.286
Well, you won those fights.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.706
That's one way of looking at it.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.505
I hated that town.

12:00.136 --> 12:04.139
The matte layer is critical. It both allows
the colors to stick to the miniature...

12:04.307 --> 12:07.726
...and it provides the finished statue
with the illusion of depth.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.896
But it's the detail work
I find the most interesting.

12:11.064 --> 12:14.733
It challenges my fine motor control.
And there are so many choices.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.069
The eyes, for example.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.279
The window to the soul.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.658
They're the window to the soul.
I read that.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.326
That's what they say.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.913
Then I should
choose my paint more carefully.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.541
It doesn't matter, John Henry.

12:30.708 --> 12:34.169
It's a statue. It's an object.
It doesn't have a soul.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.756
It has eyes.

12:38.508 --> 12:41.927
Your eyes look tired. Is your soul tired?

12:42.720 --> 12:49.059
No, my soul isn't tired. But I am.
And I am going home.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.189
Please don't.

12:54.691 --> 12:57.359
My monster is incomplete.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.284
The eyes.
What color did you wanna use?

13:06.202 --> 13:07.911
Blue.

13:08.079 --> 13:12.374
All right, pass me one of those.
Let's get this done.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.131
-Mr. Ellison?
-Yes?

13:20.758 --> 13:22.509
Does this make us friends?

13:51.956 --> 13:54.791
-You're not eating.
-What?

13:54.959 --> 13:56.710
You're not eating.

13:56.878 --> 13:59.588
What's the matter,
you don't like hash browns?

13:59.756 --> 14:01.715
No, I like them. I'm just not hungry.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.800
You're always hungry.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.844
Everyone's always hungry.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.890
Jeez, Dietz. How am I supposed to eat
with Goodnow dead and that thing...

14:10.141 --> 14:12.768
...running around out there?
Give me a break.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.270
Have mine.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.272
I said, I'm not hungry.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.858
Maybe.

14:20.485 --> 14:25.781
Or maybe you're not really Garvin.
Maybe you're that thing.

14:25.949 --> 14:28.659
-Maybe you're freaking crazy.
-He could be metal.

14:28.826 --> 14:32.871
-We wouldn't know until it was too late.
-Wanna see metal? I'll show you metal.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.957
Enough.

14:36.042 --> 14:39.878
You're right, Garvin. It's not you.

14:41.381 --> 14:45.300
You're not the one who spends all day
locked in a room with metal.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.929
Stand down, Dietz.

14:49.097 --> 14:54.685
I knew you were a metal lover,
but maybe you're more than that.

14:55.937 --> 14:58.313
Maybe you're one of them.

14:58.481 --> 15:02.734
Just like that little metal bitch
that follows Connor everywhere.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.571
Maybe we should check. For safety.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.676
Report to your duty stations.

15:51.826 --> 15:53.243
SARAH:
You're not leaving this house.

15:55.705 --> 15:56.872
John needs me.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.875
If John needed you,
he would have asked for you. He didn't.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.169
You're not leaving this house.

16:02.712 --> 16:06.340
The police could identify Riley's body
at any time.

16:06.507 --> 16:11.053
-I need to be with him if they do.
-If they do, they'll probably come here.

16:14.766 --> 16:17.184
So we should be happy he's out.

16:19.270 --> 16:24.399
-Why are you here?
-Protect John. Hunt Skynet.

16:24.942 --> 16:28.362
-Stop Judgement Day.
-But why are you here?

16:30.948 --> 16:33.408
Right now, with us?

16:34.577 --> 16:37.412
John sent you here from the future.

16:37.914 --> 16:42.250
He sent you away. Away from him.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.048
Maybe you should think about that.

16:50.468 --> 16:54.221
Maybe you should think about why
he didn't want you around anymore.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.819
Hello, Ms. Weaver.
How are you this evening?

17:09.445 --> 17:11.279
I'm well.

17:11.781 --> 17:14.282
-You're up late.
-Yes.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.452
I convinced Mr. Ellison
to leave this body operational.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.705
Did you, now?

17:20.123 --> 17:23.083
-That's progress.
-Yes.

17:23.251 --> 17:26.420
He agreed it was important
I finish painting.

17:27.630 --> 17:32.134
I made its eyes blue.
They're the window to the soul.

17:33.010 --> 17:36.513
Yes. They are.

17:37.598 --> 17:41.143
While I've been painting,
I've been taking inventory of Zeira Corp.

17:41.644 --> 17:43.812
I've discovered many interesting things.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.356
Did you know there's
a peregrine falcon nest...

17:46.816 --> 17:48.984
...on the ledge
of this building's 23rd floor?

17:49.318 --> 17:51.111
The eggs should be hatching soon.

17:51.279 --> 17:54.197
I knew about the nest.
I didn't know about the eggs.

17:54.365 --> 17:57.284
Also, I discovered
in your private database...

17:57.660 --> 18:00.871
...several letters of resignation
from former employees.

18:01.038 --> 18:05.542
Richard Hack, Lowell Rogers,
and Justin Tuck.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.796
The documents included information
about home sales...

18:09.964 --> 18:14.050
...changes of address, and new jobs to
which these employees would be moving.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.845
However, I can't find records
of these employees...

18:17.013 --> 18:19.306
...in their new locations
or at their new jobs.

18:19.474 --> 18:20.515
Is that so?

18:20.683 --> 18:24.686
Additionally, I found letters of resignation
from all members of Project Babylon...

18:24.854 --> 18:28.023
...including Mr. Murch and Mr. Ellison.

18:28.191 --> 18:30.150
Mr. Ellison's file includes documents...

18:30.318 --> 18:34.070
...showing that he's taken a new job
and moved to Copenhagen, Denmark.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.365
The documents have no dates.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.285
Now, that is very interesting.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.080
Mr. Ellison is our friend.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.875
Yes, he is our friend.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.711
Are you going to kill him?

18:54.801 --> 18:58.678
Mr. Ellison has proven himself
to be a capable and loyal employee.

18:58.846 --> 19:02.224
-But he's still a human being.
-Human life is sacred.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.559
We have to be prepared
for any contingency.

19:04.936 --> 19:06.686
What contingency would that be?

19:08.689 --> 19:10.565
Humans will disappoint you.

19:23.538 --> 19:26.039
Hey, it's Jesse, right?

19:26.415 --> 19:28.750
-Right.
-That was a pretty long swim tonight.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.087
Was it? Must have lost track of time.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.422
It's easy to do.
Happens to me all the time.

19:35.091 --> 19:36.091
Hey...

19:36.259 --> 19:38.927
...that blond girl you're normally with,
your friend.

19:39.095 --> 19:41.763
-Where is she tonight?
-Don't know.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.473
Why?

19:43.641 --> 19:46.101
Don't think I've ever seen you
in here without her.

19:46.269 --> 19:48.812
-I'll bring her next time.
-She's a nice girl.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.438
Yeah.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.566
She-- She is.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.489
-You look ill.
-I'm fine.

20:00.408 --> 20:04.494
Most likely a concussion.
You require medical attention. Rest.

20:04.996 --> 20:06.329
What about Dietz?

20:06.497 --> 20:09.249
Dietz attempted to murder
a superior officer.

20:09.417 --> 20:12.127
He incited the crew to riot,
possibly mutiny.

20:12.295 --> 20:13.962
The penalty is death.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.468
You have no right
to impose summary justice.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.471
Not like that.

20:23.681 --> 20:25.473
That's not how we do it.

20:25.641 --> 20:28.476
Mr. Dietz's behavior
threatened our mission.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.313
What mission? Hm?

20:31.772 --> 20:34.482
Your behavior threatens our mission.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.443
This crew is tearing itself apart.

20:36.611 --> 20:40.030
If they needed to know more,
they would have been told more.

20:42.491 --> 20:47.203
Whatever we brought aboard this ship,
it is dangerous.

20:47.413 --> 20:52.792
It killed a woman. It took her shape.

20:53.836 --> 20:58.506
You can't expect us
to act like that didn't happen.

20:58.841 --> 21:01.843
-Like we didn't see it.
-Report to your rack. You're ill.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.475
You really wanna do it this way?

21:08.643 --> 21:10.644
I don't understand. Do what?

21:15.191 --> 21:18.693
As XO and ranking human
onboard this boat...

21:18.861 --> 21:21.196
...I am relieving you of command.

21:21.739 --> 21:24.240
On suspicion of compromise
to your programming.

21:25.368 --> 21:28.328
Please move away
from the controls, captain.

21:45.554 --> 21:49.849

The chip tech will decide what to do.

escort Commander Flores to her rack.

22:01.612 --> 22:03.863
She is ill.

22:07.201 --> 22:11.413
I gave you an instruction, captain.
You must comply.

22:11.580 --> 22:15.792
My mission order overrides
standard behavioral protocols.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.253
You have no authority on this boat.

22:18.421 --> 22:21.631

22:21.799 --> 22:24.592
My orders are classified.

22:25.094 --> 22:26.302

22:30.641 --> 22:32.308
Queeg.

22:33.144 --> 22:36.938
We can't take that thing
to Serrano Point.

22:37.106 --> 22:41.026
-If Connor needs to know what it can--
-John Connor knows what he needs to.

22:41.944 --> 22:46.031
Return to your rack.
Your behavior threatens our mission.

23:12.058 --> 23:16.144
...record that I relieved the captain
and assumed command, time and date.

23:16.312 --> 23:18.146
We can't drive the boat without him.

-Just get in there.

24:23.921 --> 24:27.757
You're coming, right? Not going down
with the ship or anything crazy like that?

24:27.925 --> 24:31.553
No. Nothing crazy.

24:39.311 --> 24:43.022
Who are you? What do you want?

24:43.315 --> 24:45.441
Tell John Connor...

24:46.277 --> 24:48.027
...the answer is no.

25:15.556 --> 25:18.516
If you pretend not to know me,
I might shoot you in the head.

25:25.566 --> 25:30.028
We owe Riley the truth,
don't you think?

25:36.911 --> 25:39.495
We owe the dead that much.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.210
You're John Connor.

25:47.421 --> 25:49.589
Yes, I am.

Where is she?

25:53.260 --> 25:54.719

25:54.887 --> 25:58.556
If she were here, you would be dead.
You know that.

25:59.808 --> 26:03.394
Would you please give me your gun?
You're not gonna shoot me.

26:15.658 --> 26:19.369
You know, I've been running
from the machines my whole life.

26:20.537 --> 26:23.706
They tried to kill my mom
before I was even born.

26:24.750 --> 26:29.128
When I was 12,
they sent one after me.

26:32.174 --> 26:34.217
I was a kid.

26:35.427 --> 26:39.180
I was stupid.
I didn't know what it was all about.

26:40.724 --> 26:47.188
Both times, future me
sent someone back to stop them.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.149
The first time, it was a soldier.

26:50.943 --> 26:56.197
His name was Kyle Reese,
and he died saving my mother's life.

26:57.074 --> 26:59.242
The second time, it was a machine.

27:00.077 --> 27:05.164
I used to wonder why I did that.
Why I took that chance.

27:06.917 --> 27:09.043
I don't wonder anymore.

27:14.675 --> 27:17.719
Human beings can't be replaced.

27:19.221 --> 27:21.139
They can't be rebuilt.

27:21.307 --> 27:24.017
They die and they never come back.

27:26.103 --> 27:29.522
You know, it wasn't Derek who told me,
if that's what you're wondering.

27:30.399 --> 27:33.735
He loves you, you know. Derek.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.404
You and me?

27:37.614 --> 27:40.491
We're the only things he has
in this world.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.702
The only things.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.123
He's like Riley in that way.

27:53.047 --> 27:56.257
See, she made mistakes.

27:56.425 --> 27:59.510
Small things, sometimes.

27:59.678 --> 28:03.514
A word or a phrase.

28:05.934 --> 28:08.186
Carrots and apples.

28:09.605 --> 28:11.814
I'm guessing that's yours.

28:14.193 --> 28:18.696
When we were in Mexico, she heard
my real name. She ignored it...

28:18.864 --> 28:21.866
...but a man took my picture
and she destroyed his camera.

28:22.034 --> 28:25.620
She put herself between me
and a machine that was hunting me.

28:27.539 --> 28:32.794
So one day, I realized
she wasn't treating me like John Baum.

28:32.961 --> 28:35.296
She was treating me like John Connor.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.341
When was that?

28:40.094 --> 28:42.095
I don't remember exactly.

28:44.473 --> 28:46.641
It was a bad day, though.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.937
Bad day.

28:51.647 --> 28:54.232
Anyway, I started following her...

28:56.610 --> 28:58.611
...and the rest was easy.

28:59.530 --> 29:00.613
And hard.

29:01.198 --> 29:03.491
She wanted to tell you.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.536
I know...

29:07.246 --> 29:09.080
...but she didn't.

29:12.459 --> 29:14.585
She do that to you?

29:15.712 --> 29:18.506
See, she figured out
what you really had planned.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.759
Figured it out before I did.

29:22.428 --> 29:25.805
I couldn't explain why she would
tell the school counselor...

29:25.973 --> 29:27.932
...or go to DCFS.

29:29.643 --> 29:31.894
She didn't, did she?

29:37.025 --> 29:40.403
I only understood
after I saw how you'd hurt her.

29:41.155 --> 29:43.156
That's when I knew
what you tried to do...

29:43.323 --> 29:45.241
...and how it went wrong.

29:46.368 --> 29:48.286
You saw her?

29:49.371 --> 29:50.496
I'm sorry.

29:51.582 --> 29:54.625
Yeah. Everybody says that.

29:59.673 --> 30:01.632
The thing is...

30:03.886 --> 30:05.887
...this is all my fault.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.639
I knew Riley was in trouble.

30:09.183 --> 30:12.894
I didn't help her.
I should have, but I didn't.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.271
I knew what she was.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.107
I didn't try to stop her.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.568
You wanted it to be real.

30:20.736 --> 30:23.196
Or maybe I wanted to win.

30:25.991 --> 30:28.618
You didn't wanna be John Baum.

30:28.785 --> 30:31.579
You wanted to be John Connor.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.666
That's just the thing, isn't it?

30:36.502 --> 30:39.962

Would it have worked?

What?

31:15.999 --> 31:18.960
If the cyborg had murdered the girl.

31:19.127 --> 31:21.128
Or if I could've made you
believe she had.

31:21.296 --> 31:25.341
Would I have sent Cameron away?
Would I have killed her?

31:29.012 --> 31:30.513
No.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.394
Well...

31:37.938 --> 31:40.439
...it's a damn shame, then.

...and one of our most important
strategic assets.

-The submarine is irreplaceable.
-The Trip-8. The sub.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.179
You forgot the people.

32:12.347 --> 32:16.350
You never mention
the people who died. Ever.

32:16.518 --> 32:20.855
Yes. The people. And the box.

32:21.023 --> 32:25.318
We opened the damn box.
Hell came out of it.

32:25.485 --> 32:27.612

do we need to go over this?

32:27.779 --> 32:29.530

32:31.658 --> 32:33.534

-Take me to Connor.
-You can tell me.

32:43.670 --> 32:46.380
It came to me before we escaped...

32:46.548 --> 32:50.009
...and it gave me a message
for John Connor.

32:50.177 --> 32:51.844
For him.

32:53.347 --> 32:55.139
Not for you.

as telling Connor?

You're not the same.
It's not the same.

Fine.

33:33.053 --> 33:36.305
To hell with you.
You tell John Connor...

33:36.473 --> 33:41.185
...that the metal monster said,
"The answer is no."

what was the question?

34:01.456 --> 34:03.457
"Will you join us?"

34:04.751 --> 34:08.337
-What?
-That was the question.

34:08.505 --> 34:10.005
"Will you join us?"

34:22.185 --> 34:24.145
I'm sorry for your loss.

The doctors aren't certain
if it happened because of the fight...

34:29.401 --> 34:33.571
...or because of the rapid change in

35:26.249 --> 35:29.293
-Who?
-No.

No, you don't.

35:41.014 --> 35:43.849
He was in my squad.
We fought together.

35:45.727 --> 35:48.604
We saw things you can't imagine.

35:50.065 --> 35:52.942
He was like my brother,
and I loved him.

35:53.109 --> 35:58.030
But it turns out
I never really knew him.

36:01.117 --> 36:03.244
His real name was Andy Goode...

36:04.162 --> 36:07.581
...and back here, in this world,
he created a computer program.

36:07.749 --> 36:10.417
The program that becomes Skynet.

36:11.628 --> 36:13.963

36:16.341 --> 36:18.884
...and Billy Wisher is dead too...

36:20.637 --> 36:21.804
...because I killed him.

36:23.557 --> 36:26.475
I came back here and I killed him.

36:26.643 --> 36:28.269
He was my brother...

36:30.814 --> 36:32.773
...and I loved him, and I killed him.

38:54.958 --> 38:56.291
That watch.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.920
It has complications.

39:01.715 --> 39:04.133
Something I learned.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.093
Something I've been thinking about.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.973
Complications?

39:12.308 --> 39:13.809
Yeah.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.145
Time.

39:18.231 --> 39:19.481
The future.

39:26.906 --> 39:28.991
What do they think of me?

39:31.703 --> 39:33.954
In the future. What do people think?

39:36.416 --> 39:37.875
Well...

39:40.128 --> 39:42.421
...if you're asking if...

39:45.091 --> 39:50.429
...people agree with everything you do,
of course not.

39:52.891 --> 39:55.517
If you're asking if everybody loves you...

39:57.896 --> 40:00.189
...love's a lot to ask for.

40:05.153 --> 40:07.696
You can't do what you do...

40:09.699 --> 40:15.037
...and expect everybody to agree.
Or to love you.

40:16.456 --> 40:19.208
And what is it that I do?

40:19.626 --> 40:21.251
You lead.

40:23.338 --> 40:25.547
And they follow.

40:25.715 --> 40:27.549
We follow.

40:29.886 --> 40:34.014
We rise or fall on your shoulders.

40:35.391 --> 40:37.810
Humanity rises...

40:39.395 --> 40:40.479
...or falls.

40:43.775 --> 40:46.110
But we're always watching.

40:48.279 --> 40:51.824
-For me to make a mistake?
-For you to be human.

41:10.426 --> 41:12.094
Did you do it?

41:13.763 --> 41:15.597
Did you kill her?

41:16.766 --> 41:19.226
John Connor let her go.

42:12.739 --> 42:14.448
Come here.

42:17.785 --> 42:21.205
Pretty girl. What's your name?

42:49.317 --> 42:52.110
[SOBBING]
