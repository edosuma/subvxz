00:01.710 --> 00:03.461
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:03.545 --> 00:07.507
Had this been an actual broken bone,
Fiona's arm would be quite bruised.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.509
Real blood, fake cast.

00:11.303 --> 00:13.930
I think it would be good to be a patient.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.139
Talked to Kevin

00:15.224 --> 00:20.603
about your idea of a gift for the girls and I...
It just makes him uncomfortable.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.980
Every interaction
is stored in the Pill-O-Matix memory.

00:23.065 --> 00:25.817
It's totally inappropriate
to have this meeting in front of Eddie.

00:25.901 --> 00:28.069
Your shitty pill dispenser is replacing me.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.195
What up?

00:30.406 --> 00:31.406
Is your face different?

00:31.990 --> 00:33.574
I trimmed my goatee.

00:33.659 --> 00:34.867
Looks good.

00:36.078 --> 00:38.371
-I do not like that guy.
-I do not care.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.206
Take it up with HR.

00:41.125 --> 00:43.000
I'd be happy to go to HR.

00:43.085 --> 00:45.253
Shouldn't you be peeing
in a cup somewhere?

00:45.337 --> 00:46.754
Shouldn't you?

00:46.839 --> 00:49.340
When I get nervous,
I act out with inappropriate sexual touches.

00:49.425 --> 00:50.633
It's like Tourette's.

00:51.343 --> 00:53.803
-Yo, Eddie, what's up?
-Hey.

00:54.138 --> 00:57.056
Oh, my God, he's completely mad.

01:59.036 --> 02:02.371
And everyone said
I had the coolest show and tell ever.

02:02.456 --> 02:07.001
And Dr. O'Hara took a big saw
and cut off my cast.

02:07.085 --> 02:10.588
And she was wearing
a really pretty purple dress with high heels.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.341
I know, honey. I was there, remember?

02:13.842 --> 02:15.676
-You were?
-Yes.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.011
Eat your burger.

02:19.515 --> 02:23.184
-She smells like flowers.
-Really? What do I smell like?

02:27.856 --> 02:31.234
I really want to send Fi
to Immaculate Virgin with Grace.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.237
-She's perfectly happy where she is.
-Well, I'm not.

02:34.321 --> 02:37.281
This year, last year, both teachers
calling our parenting into question?

02:37.366 --> 02:38.825
It's none of their goddamn business.

02:38.909 --> 02:42.078
No, I don't disagree,
but where's the money gonna come from?

02:44.498 --> 02:48.960
No. We're not taking handouts
from O'Hara or anyone.

02:49.044 --> 02:51.671
It's not a handout.
And it's not for us, it's for the girls.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.756
Jackie, I'm not having
this conversation again, okay?

02:53.841 --> 02:56.217
-You gotta promise me.
-All right.

02:56.301 --> 02:59.262
-Well, we can figure something out.
-You need to hear me.

02:59.763 --> 03:02.431
You need to promise me
that we're not gonna take that money.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.851
Okay, I promise.

03:05.477 --> 03:06.561
Okay.

03:07.271 --> 03:11.274
-Mommy, can I have Grace's French fries?
-Why, where's Grace?

03:11.358 --> 03:14.569
She's in the bathroom.
She said she needed some privacy.

03:14.653 --> 03:16.654
Why does she need privacy? She's a kid.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.537
Grace, you okay?

03:26.206 --> 03:27.999
Grace, open the door.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.920
Hey, you okay? What's going on?

03:34.339 --> 03:36.424
-Nothing.
-You sure?

03:38.969 --> 03:39.969
Sorry.

03:43.849 --> 03:46.517
I'm gonna call Dr. Bowen and find out
what's going on at those sessions.

03:47.102 --> 03:48.811
She's not gonna tell you
what they talk about.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.690
Dr. Bowen said Grace will open up about it
when she wants to.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.150
That's a bunch of crap. I'm her mother.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.527
When she's ready to talk to you, sweetie,
she will.

03:56.612 --> 03:58.738
How am I supposed to help her
if everything is a secret?

04:54.628 --> 04:57.338
Hi. I need a money order, please.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.599
-Full moon, totally called it.
-Asshole.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.685
-Totally called it.
-How is this tangled already?

05:10.852 --> 05:12.770
This day is already too long.
A little help here!

05:12.854 --> 05:15.690
Took a while to bring it up because
it's always a difficult discussion to have.

05:15.774 --> 05:17.066
Why, 'cause you make more than he does?

05:17.150 --> 05:20.111
No, it's no fun to talk about money
when you don't have any.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.905
It itches! It itches! Get it off!

05:22.990 --> 05:25.408
Fun when you did it, not so fun now!

05:27.202 --> 05:29.120
So anyway, he agreed.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.872
He finally agreed to let you
set up a college fund for the girls.

05:33.917 --> 05:37.461
If I believed in crying at work,
I would be tearing up. I'm thrilled!

05:37.546 --> 05:40.798
Yes, but instead of a college fund,
can we make it an education fund?

05:40.882 --> 05:42.591
'Cause I really want to get Fiona
into private school.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.343
-Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
-Wait, my back, my back!

05:44.428 --> 05:45.845
Oh, my God, sorry, sorry, sorry.
You all right?

05:45.929 --> 05:48.014
Stab wound, upper abdomen.
He's losing a lot of blood.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.098
Got it.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.143
I'm really happy about this, Jacks.

05:55.647 --> 05:58.733
Kind of slow there, Jackie.
Where's the hustle?

05:59.609 --> 06:00.776
Prepare to die.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.822
That guy in three peed all over my shoes.

06:07.242 --> 06:10.745
-That sucks.
-It's fine. I'm riding a pink cloud.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.498
It's an AA thing.
It means I'm in a good mood.

06:15.292 --> 06:18.294
I swear if Hostess made a pink cloud,
I'd eat it.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.254
I wish they had better snacks here.

06:20.338 --> 06:21.881
The whole place is sub-par.

06:22.507 --> 06:25.051
I launch a killer campaign
to bring in better patients

06:25.135 --> 06:27.636
and no one around here knows
how to take it to the next level.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.306
You're good.

06:30.974 --> 06:34.435
I'm like a shark, man.
If I'm not moving, I'm dying.

06:37.606 --> 06:40.900
30s, head trauma,
picked him up at the Carlton Hotel.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.986
-Looks like it could be DV.
-What's a DV? Is that serious?

06:44.071 --> 06:47.114
-Domestic violence. Is that true?
-Well, yeah, I guess.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.075
I hit him, but only after he hit me.

06:49.159 --> 06:52.036
Come on, Suzy, you beat me on the head
with a jar of cashews.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.621
-Expensive.
-Tell me about it.

06:53.705 --> 06:56.165
-And she kicked me.
-You wanna tell them everything?

06:56.249 --> 06:57.500
-Go ahead.
-Look, I'm done with this.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.794
Why don't you go call your mother
and complain about me some more?

06:59.878 --> 07:02.088
-Fuck you.
-Okay. All right. Calm down.

07:02.172 --> 07:06.133
-He deserves it. You deserve it!
-Hey! Back off!

07:07.427 --> 07:08.844
You're all right. You're okay.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.639
Okay. Don't worry, honey.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.808
With a little extra pressure here,
we'll get it to stop.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.519
Can I get a hand in here, please? Zoey?

07:18.688 --> 07:21.899
Thor? Sam? Anybody?

07:21.983 --> 07:23.943
-Is there a problem?
-Yes, I got a pumper here.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.070
Can you jump in, please?

07:26.154 --> 07:27.780
Yes. Thank you.

07:29.533 --> 07:31.033
Up just a bit.

07:33.495 --> 07:36.205
No one met us at the bay.
This guy needs an EKG.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.333
220 over 100, chest pains,
but no history of Ml.

07:39.417 --> 07:40.543
-Oh, Jesus.
-Good?

07:40.627 --> 07:42.878
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, go, go.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.172
Let's get him on the bed!

07:45.257 --> 07:47.007
Okay, I need you to be still.

07:47.259 --> 07:48.843
Okay, I'm gonna get you
something for the pain.

07:49.010 --> 07:52.513
Gloria, I'll keep an eye on your EKG, okay?
Now, get me four morphines.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.685
Gotta go find out
where these other fuckers are.

08:02.732 --> 08:05.151
-What is this?
-Broken. Again.

08:10.699 --> 08:14.785
All right, everyone, listen very carefully
because I'm only gonna say this once.

08:14.995 --> 08:18.622
This machine is a piece of shit.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.584
I think I'll say it again.

08:22.252 --> 08:25.421
This machine is a piece of shit!

08:52.407 --> 08:53.449
What do you need?

08:55.202 --> 08:59.079
Look, I'm fine. It's just a little headache.
Let me get out of here.

08:59.164 --> 09:02.249
Indulge me. Follow my finger.

09:06.463 --> 09:07.755
Can you smile for me?

09:09.382 --> 09:10.549
Clench your teeth.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.427
Now, that's easy for him to do,
he's from Connecticut.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.221
Well, the money
never seemed to bother you, did it?

09:15.513 --> 09:17.181
Money's not the problem, Timothy.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.308
Can I speak to you outside for a minute?

09:22.103 --> 09:24.271
Look, he's got a pretty serious head gash

09:24.356 --> 09:26.523
and clearly,
the two of you have some issues.

09:26.608 --> 09:29.610
You don't know the half of it.
I need a Diet Coke.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.905
Thor, can you give Suzy
a tour of the vending machines, please?

09:32.989 --> 09:35.241
You betcha.
They're beautiful this time of year.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.326
The Skittles are in bloom.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.371
So what happened?

09:40.455 --> 09:43.582
I told her we couldn't go away
every weekend.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.960
She threw a jar of nuts at my head

09:46.044 --> 09:48.712
and before she could throw
the whole mini-bar, I shoved her back.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.381
Dude, you can't hit a woman.

09:50.465 --> 09:51.924
Well, I had to defend myself.

09:52.634 --> 09:55.928
There is no excuse
for hitting a woman, ever.

09:56.012 --> 09:59.014
Well, it's not like I make a habit of this,
but she pushed me too far.

09:59.891 --> 10:00.933
Jackie?

10:01.768 --> 10:03.769
No, I don't think men should hit women,

10:03.853 --> 10:06.063
but if someone bashes you
in the head without provocation,

10:06.147 --> 10:09.024
-you have the right to defend yourself.
-No, you don't.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.859
Not if you're a guy
and the hitter is a woman.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.153
-Well, I disagree.
-Yeah, me, too.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.156
So you're advocating
violence against women?

10:16.241 --> 10:18.492
No, of course not.
I'm just saying it's a two-way street.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.828
I can't believe I'm standing here
listening to this insanity.

10:21.329 --> 10:24.248
You're a little touchy. What's up?
The modeling career petering out?

10:24.332 --> 10:26.458
You're all fucking nuts.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.922
He'll be right back.

10:32.173 --> 10:35.592
Hi, Dr. Bowen.
Yes, thanks for getting back to me.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.928
Yeah, I'm sorry about the voicemails.

10:38.013 --> 10:41.473
I'm just a little perplexed about
why you can't tell me

10:41.558 --> 10:44.935
what's going on
with the therapy sessions with Grace.

10:45.478 --> 10:49.398
I mean, I know it's her time, but I really do
need to know what's going on.

10:50.775 --> 10:56.071
Can you tell her that maybe she can share
some of what she talks about?

10:57.866 --> 11:02.745
Okay, great. All right, that's something.
Thanks. Bye.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.373
Hey, guys. What's going on?

11:06.458 --> 11:10.210
I got knocked out of the bike lane
by this tiny-ass woman in a big-butt SUV.

11:10.295 --> 11:11.795
Yeah, it totally wasn't his fault.

11:11.880 --> 11:15.299
And she didn't stop.
She was on her cell phone, an LG 280.

11:15.383 --> 11:18.385
That's like six years old.
I was like, "I can't believe these still exist."

11:18.470 --> 11:20.471
I have an insurance card.
I'm a full-time student.

11:20.555 --> 11:22.139
You so don't have to call my parents.

11:22.724 --> 11:25.225
-Where'd you get hit?
-Well, I got clipped in the leg

11:25.310 --> 11:27.311
and when I fell, I heard this crack.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.813
And it pretty much felt
like my hip was on fire.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.648
Zoey, can I get a wheelchair?

11:31.733 --> 11:32.775
Dude, do you want me
to go back to the dorm,

11:32.859 --> 11:34.902
get your anthro paper,
bring it in when I turn in mine?

11:34.986 --> 11:36.653
Yeah, could you just spell-check it
one more time?

11:36.738 --> 11:38.155
Okay, you're in good hands.

11:38.239 --> 11:41.533
Okay, so, should I go?
I mean, I could go and then come back.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.994
He'll be with me. He'll be fine.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.673
-So, the Pill-O-Matix is a piece of shit?
-I'd forgotten.

11:56.758 --> 11:59.176
When you're a nurse, if you say something
in one part of the hospital,

11:59.260 --> 12:03.097
it will always trickle back to the station.
Yeah, it's a piece of shit.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.390
So get rid of it. Get a new one.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.975
The patient in three
is screaming for pain meds.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.020
-Can somebody do that?
-Yes, when somebody asks nicely.

12:10.105 --> 12:12.981
You'll be happy to know I'm gonna
begin interviewing for a pharmacist.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.609
I've already put in a call to Eddie Walzer.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.194
Awesome!

12:17.278 --> 12:20.322
Seriously, there's not a doctor here that's
not gonna be psyched to have him back.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.032
You want to bring Eddie back
to the pharmacy?

12:22.117 --> 12:24.743
Am I wrong
or wasn't this a budgetary issue?

12:24.828 --> 12:26.870
Between paying for the machine,
the repairs,

12:26.955 --> 12:29.832
and the security I had to hire
to guard the goddamn thing,

12:30.125 --> 12:31.708
it was more expensive.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.544
That doesn't mean
that Eddie Walzer's the solution.

12:33.628 --> 12:35.879
I mean, I'm sure
there's lots of great candidates out there.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.340
Isn’t she great? She's so loyal.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.550
Out of sight, out of mind.

12:39.634 --> 12:42.553
Just like the guy in three
who needs pain meds now.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.682
Look, nurse to nurse.

12:47.183 --> 12:50.894
This is not about the doctors.
This decision directly affects the nurses.

12:50.979 --> 12:53.397
Eddie kind of lost it
when the Pill-O-Matix came.

12:53.481 --> 12:56.817
-It's not that he wasn't good at his job...
-All right, I hear you.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.571
Hey, I don't want to interrupt your flow,

13:00.655 --> 13:02.781
but I kind of have something
important to do today.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.618
Are you asking for time off? Today?
Right now? This day?

13:07.245 --> 13:08.328
Reconsider!

13:16.754 --> 13:18.964
It's been so great having you on the floor.

13:19.674 --> 13:22.050
It's like when the President
goes to visit a factory for a day

13:22.135 --> 13:26.680
and he's all in there with the people.
Like you have been with us.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.601
Want some? Thor says they're in bloom.

13:38.693 --> 13:40.527
Everyone there is just out for themselves.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.821
I was trying to give something back,
you know?

13:42.906 --> 13:45.449
There was so much promise
in the face of All Saints.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.701
Now it's just gone to shit.

13:48.912 --> 13:51.205
-That's a tough break, Coop.
-Yeah.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.874
I already feel better talking to you about it.

13:55.460 --> 13:59.129
Hey, on the bright side,
Akalitus might want to bring you back.

13:59.214 --> 14:00.506
-No kidding?
-Yeah.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.800
I think your biggest roadblock's
gonna be Jackie.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.427
She thinks things are fine the way they are.

14:07.722 --> 14:10.641
Yeah, well, it's a good thing
Jackie doesn't call all the shots, right?

14:10.725 --> 14:11.934
No shit.

14:14.020 --> 14:17.064
You know what we need?
A guys' night out.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.901
Toss a few back, play some darts.
You free tonight?

14:20.985 --> 14:23.487
Actually, I already have plans
with your pal Georgia.

14:25.156 --> 14:28.116
And I introduced the two of you.
How's that for the ultimate irony?

14:28.201 --> 14:29.535
What?

14:29.827 --> 14:33.288
Well, I want to hang out with you,
but you're busy because of me.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.748
It's ironic.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.417
I'll take your word for it.

14:38.670 --> 14:41.296
No, no, it's ironic. Trust me.

14:45.677 --> 14:48.345
Would you like some Milk Duds
with your sugar-free gum?

14:48.763 --> 14:49.763
No. Thanks.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.433
It's a big day. I'm celebrating.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.853
-Six months sober today.
-Wow.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.565
-Congratulations. That's a big deal, right?
-Yeah.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.277
So I was wondering if I could skip out
for, like, an hour.

15:03.778 --> 15:07.698
I'm working a double and I was hoping to
pick up my chip on the actual day.

15:07.991 --> 15:09.575
-My sponsor's gonna be there...
-Fine. Go.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.910
You know, I respect what you're doing.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.912
Thanks.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.043
Jacks, good.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.463
-How do you want to do this?
-Do what?

15:23.548 --> 15:26.300
I'm just looking
for a quiet place to sit down.

15:26.384 --> 15:29.886
The money.
I can either pay the school directly

15:29.971 --> 15:31.847
or would you prefer it
if I just send you a check?

15:31.931 --> 15:34.975
I don't know. Would that be weird,
me just getting a big check?

15:35.059 --> 15:37.144
It's not a sweepstakes.

15:37.228 --> 15:40.230
It's a normal-size check for an amount
that won't make me think twice.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.694
Have you eaten?

15:47.322 --> 15:49.156
Coffee, banana, Vicodin.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.491
Breakfast of champions.

15:52.243 --> 15:53.702
Meanwhile,

15:53.953 --> 15:57.831
please step away from the gurney transfers
and the heavy lifting.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.209
You have Thor, he's a giant. Use him.

16:03.504 --> 16:06.214
And for the love of all that's good and holy,
get an MRI.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.884
I almost don't want to see the damage.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.434
Closer to godmother by the second.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.645
Okay, you know what?
We can't exactly rechristen the girls.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.730
Not that you would not be great at it.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.106
I know. I know.

16:23.191 --> 16:26.068
But if you and Kevin
die in a fiery plane crash,

16:26.152 --> 16:27.653
they will be mine.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.905
We don't get away very much.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.990
So let me pay for a trip!

16:33.534 --> 16:35.827
I feel so much better.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.079
Pain meds.

16:37.372 --> 16:40.165
Sort of like four Captain Morgans and OJ.

16:41.376 --> 16:44.294
-I'm not gonna throw up though, am I?
-Highly unlikely.

16:44.379 --> 16:49.675
Hello. All right, bad news, I'm afraid.
You've got a hairline fracture in your hip.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.927
Ortho will be down for a consult,

16:52.011 --> 16:54.262
but basically it will be about
eight to 12 weeks before you're healed.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.390
That's a whole semester.

16:56.474 --> 16:58.058
Yeah, you should really
talk to your parents.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.559
Do you think that you could call them?

17:00.061 --> 17:02.229
They'd feel better hearing it
from someone older than me.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.065
Not by that much.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.739
I have to leave school if I can't get around.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.660
-Do you have an iPhone?
-Yeah.

17:16.744 --> 17:17.953
Let me have it.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.125
-Why?
-Give it.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.507
-Look sadder.
-No, just stop, please.

17:30.591 --> 17:31.675
Just do it.

17:37.348 --> 17:38.640
Perfect.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.602
E-mail that to five girls you know and write,

17:42.937 --> 17:46.273
"Just mowed down by big rig.
Truckers are dicks.

17:46.357 --> 17:49.943
"At All Saints right now.
What are you guys doing?"

17:50.903 --> 17:51.987
And then what?

17:52.071 --> 17:53.363
Then wait.

18:00.079 --> 18:05.000
Okay, so we are almost caught up.
Thank you, Gloria, very much.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.586
It was my pleasure.

18:08.296 --> 18:10.464
It's like riding a bike, you never forget.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.924
Would you mind sticking around
for a little bit longer?

18:13.009 --> 18:15.135
Sam has been MIA for over an hour.

18:15.219 --> 18:18.805
I don't know where he goes.
This is not the first time this has happened.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.934
I told that shit not to go anywhere.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.144
Well...

18:27.440 --> 18:29.608
Son of a bitch.

18:30.151 --> 18:33.278
-Dr. Cooper said you refused a CAT scan.
-I just want to get out of here.

18:33.362 --> 18:36.031
I am required to inform you
you'll be leaving against medical advice.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.784
That being said, you need to keep
the stitches dry. I need you to make...

18:38.868 --> 18:39.993
What happened to you?

18:40.495 --> 18:42.120
I just got a call
from the insurance company.

18:42.205 --> 18:44.414
They're denying coverage
because you didn't pay the premium?

18:44.624 --> 18:46.583
Why don't you let me pay the bills?

18:48.377 --> 18:50.504
Who are you? Who is she?

18:58.513 --> 19:00.597
Oh, God.
Can I get a hand over here, please?

19:00.681 --> 19:02.140
Easy, bro. Easy.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.768
Get him in the sled,
I'm right behind you. Go.

19:10.525 --> 19:13.026
He vomited blood, passed out.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.947
Wow. She really did kick him.

19:17.031 --> 19:18.657
Well, according to you,
he probably deserved it.

19:18.908 --> 19:21.243
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, let's all hit each other. Kumbaya.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.370
-Hey, guys...
-Dr. Cooper, watch the attitude.

19:23.454 --> 19:26.081
My attitude? You're telling everybody
to beat the crap out of each other,

19:26.165 --> 19:27.791
to defend themselves.
And now look what happened.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.377
-Dr. Cooper, I did not kick this man.
-Well, you might as well have

19:30.461 --> 19:31.962
because you're a domestic
violence advocate.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.630
And you're abusive to nurses.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.340
His BP is dropping.
I think we need to intubate.

19:35.424 --> 19:39.135
If I said half the shit that I wanted to,
you'd be reduced to tears on a daily basis.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.847
I hold back!
You're lucky that I have this much restraint!

19:41.931 --> 19:45.100
Dr. Cooper, pay attention!
You need to pay attention!

19:46.853 --> 19:49.521
-Shit.
-Dude, dude! What the hell?

19:53.484 --> 19:56.611
-Guys! Guys! Enough!
-He hit me!

19:56.696 --> 19:59.906
Lenny, that thing, it's a tic. It's Tourette's.
He can't help it.

20:00.491 --> 20:01.867
-It's a tic?
-Yes.

20:01.951 --> 20:04.953
Man. Man. I'm so sorry.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.955
Dr. Cooper, get over here
and intubate your fucking patient.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.000
Dude, it was a reflex
and I didn't know you had the tic thing.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.711
Find O'Hara. Go.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.301
Call respiratory.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.179
Fabulous. Who hit who first?

20:23.598 --> 20:26.725
Well, Dr. Cooper swung first,
but Lenny connected first.

20:27.685 --> 20:30.562
I think it's romantic.
He was defending your honor.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.397
I don't need defending.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.317
Everyone needs defending.

20:36.777 --> 20:40.155
Well, hello. And who are all of you?

20:40.239 --> 20:43.783
This is Bethany and Tomisson and Jane.

20:44.452 --> 20:47.621
They all offered to help me till my hip heals.
So I don't have to go home now.

20:47.705 --> 20:50.749
Yeah, we're all over it.
We organized shifts for this week.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.585
-How nice.
-Thanks again for everything.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.422
Now get out of here, you crazy kids!

21:02.011 --> 21:03.970
That's not gonna end well.

21:04.555 --> 21:06.765
One of the great things
about having four sisters

21:06.849 --> 21:10.518
-was I always had my own room.
-I bet they hated you.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.062
Yeah, I think they still do a little.

21:13.481 --> 21:16.942
Well, I think guys
who are raised around a lot of women

21:17.026 --> 21:18.610
grow up to be more trustworthy.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.613
They learn the big lessons early.

21:21.697 --> 21:24.574
Well, I have certainly learned
a lot of lessons from women.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.290
It's Coop.

21:32.917 --> 21:36.044
Shit. He's in the ER.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.923
-He's always in the ER.
-No, he says he's a patient in the ER.

21:40.174 --> 21:42.008
Well, it's about time.

21:45.346 --> 21:46.596
I'm out, buddy.

21:46.681 --> 21:48.056
-No, no, it's on me.
-Okay.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.600
-All right, gracias. Come on.
-Bye.

21:53.562 --> 21:56.773
You disappeared for two hours
after I specifically told you not to.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.108
That's insubordination.

21:58.192 --> 22:02.278
-Jackie said it was okay, I just...
-I don't want to hear it. I don't care.

22:02.363 --> 22:03.613
I'm putting you on probation.

22:12.540 --> 22:15.625
Mrs. A? I never come in here.

22:16.752 --> 22:19.087
Just wanted to say it was

22:20.339 --> 22:22.924
fun to have you on the floor today.

22:23.676 --> 22:27.721
Okay. Well, thank you.
I miss it, being with patients.

22:29.932 --> 22:32.559
And I quite enjoyed your pithy remarks.

22:33.936 --> 22:35.103
I try.

22:42.236 --> 22:43.737
Well, bye-bye.

22:47.450 --> 22:49.534
-I need to speak to the wife.
-Yes.

22:49.618 --> 22:52.287
Your husband is stabilized.
He had some internal bleeding,

22:52.371 --> 22:53.872
but we were able to catch it in time.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.999
So someone will
take you to see him in just a few minutes.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.334
-I can see him?
-No, you can't fucking see him.

22:58.419 --> 23:00.086
-You've done enough damage.
-He loves me.

23:00.171 --> 23:01.796
-Please.
-I'm going.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.299
-I'm going.
-Okay, both of you sit down.

23:08.679 --> 23:11.139
What am I supposed to do here,
share my peanut butter crackers with her?

23:11.223 --> 23:16.770
No. What has to happen, because...
When he first came in...

23:17.521 --> 23:19.647
Ordinarily, the wife... The husband...

23:21.067 --> 23:23.777
This woman is your husband's...

23:23.861 --> 23:27.447
This woman is your... When he... All right.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.284
I know nothing about this sort of thing.

23:37.666 --> 23:40.376
Jackie Peyton, as I live and breathe.

23:40.461 --> 23:42.295
-Hi, hi, hello.
-Georgia.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.923
-Hi. We met at your...
-No, I remember. Yeah.

23:45.382 --> 23:48.134
-Do you know where Coop is?
-Yeah.

23:48.219 --> 23:49.969
-Trauma, down the hall.
-Okay.

23:50.054 --> 23:51.554
What kind of doctor gets his nose broken?

23:56.143 --> 23:57.519
You're not gonna go
visit your buddy Coop?

23:58.020 --> 24:01.147
Hey, I didn't break his nose.
I'm just here with his friend.

24:04.902 --> 24:08.279
I'm in your orbit, baby.
Ain't nothing you can do about it.

24:09.073 --> 24:12.075
You talking about the pharmacy?
Because I don't care one way or the other.

24:12.159 --> 24:14.786
-You can do what you want.
-I'm gonna.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.331
Why, Eddie? Why the fuck
would you want to come back?

24:21.043 --> 24:23.419
Go, be with your girlfriend.

24:23.504 --> 24:24.838
She's not my girlfriend.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.928
You know who my girlfriend is.

24:46.569 --> 24:47.902
Nice.

24:48.445 --> 24:50.113
It's gonna be straighter than before.

24:50.197 --> 24:51.322
What?

24:59.165 --> 25:00.373
Thanks.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.879
You know I'm fine.
You don't need to stay here.

25:06.672 --> 25:10.800
It's the least I can do.
You defended my honor.

25:12.803 --> 25:14.804
Would you mind
if I suggested something to watch?

25:14.889 --> 25:17.098
It will not be sports.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.725
It's all yours.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.588
Grace, open the door!

25:48.672 --> 25:50.465
-Open the door!
-I've got it.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.592
I've got it. I've got it.

25:55.763 --> 25:58.014
Grace, honey,

25:58.098 --> 26:00.099
you cannot lock yourself in the bathroom.

26:00.184 --> 26:03.478
This is none of your business!
It's none of your business!

26:03.562 --> 26:05.939
What, honey?
What is none of our business?

26:07.608 --> 26:08.900
Honey.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.194
Oh, my God.

26:11.987 --> 26:15.490
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, sweetie.

26:22.289 --> 26:24.249
Can I go to my room, please?

26:25.167 --> 26:27.877
Honey, you have to talk to me.
I'm right here.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.965
We cannot have secrets in this house.
