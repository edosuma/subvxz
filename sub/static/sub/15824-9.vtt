WEBVTT

00:00.768 --> 00:04.705
* I NEVER CRAWLED
BEFORE I WALKED *

00:04.738 --> 00:08.309
* AND I WAS SINGING
BEFORE I TALKED *

00:08.342 --> 00:12.180
* NOTHIN' FEELS BETTER
THAN STRUMMIN' MY GUITAR *

00:12.213 --> 00:16.817
* SO I ASK MY DADDY,
"WILL I BE A STAR?" *

00:16.850 --> 00:20.254
YESTERDAY, 43-YEAR-OLD
INDIANA NATIVE BOB MICHAELS

00:20.288 --> 00:23.124
SET OUT ON A HIKE IN
THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS

00:23.157 --> 00:24.592
AND NEVER RETURNED.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.795
* I WANT TO DO MORE
THAN SETTLE FOR LESS *

00:27.828 --> 00:30.498
Taylor: HIKING IS GENERALLY
A SAFE ACTIVITY,

00:30.531 --> 00:31.832
BUT NOT OUT HERE, ALONE,

00:31.865 --> 00:34.702
AT NIGHT, IN THE WORLD'S
LARGEST URBAN PARK.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.306
COME ON, BOY.

00:38.339 --> 00:41.542
THE ONLY CLUE TO MR. MICHAELS'
DISAPPEARANCE IS THIS MINIVAN,

00:41.575 --> 00:44.312
WHICH BROUGHT HIM, HIS WIFE,
AND DAUGHTER --

00:44.345 --> 00:45.779
A BUDDING TALENT --

00:45.813 --> 00:48.449
FROM FORT WAYNE TO HOLLYWOOD,
CHASING THE DREAM,

00:48.482 --> 00:50.184
A DREAM THAT RESCUERS HERE

00:50.218 --> 00:53.321
ARE TRYING TO STOP FROM TURNING
INTO A NIGHTMARE.

00:53.354 --> 00:56.724
AS THE SUN SETS ON THE SECOND
DAY OF RESCUE EFFORTS HERE

00:56.757 --> 00:58.659
IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS,

00:58.692 --> 01:02.463
THE MOOD AMONGST THOSE SEARCHING
FOR BOB MICHAELS TURNS GRIM.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.832
BACK HOME
IN FORT WAYNE, INDIANA,

01:04.865 --> 01:06.534
CITY OF CHURCHES,

01:06.567 --> 01:09.503
BOB MICHAELS IS A SOMETIME
COMMUNITY-THEATER ACTOR

01:09.537 --> 01:11.305
WHO, LIKE MANY DOTING FATHERS,

01:11.339 --> 01:14.308
DREAMS HIS DAUGHTER HAS
THE STUFF TO BECOME A STAR.

01:14.342 --> 01:16.344
AND "EXTRA" HAS THE MUSIC VIDEO

01:16.377 --> 01:19.213
MISSY MICHAELS RECORDED
JUST LAST WEEK.

01:19.247 --> 01:22.416
TRAGICALLY, IT NOW PLAYS
LIKE A COUNTRY POP HYMN

01:22.450 --> 01:23.884
TO MISSY'S MISSING DAD.

01:23.917 --> 01:30.491
* PLEASE SAY, "YE-E-E-E-S"

01:30.524 --> 01:33.294
ON DAY FOUR OF THE SEARCH
FOR BOB MICHAELS,

01:33.327 --> 01:35.163
CRITICISM CONTINUES TO MOUNT

01:35.196 --> 01:38.666
OVER WHAT SOME SAY SHOULD HAVE
BEEN AN EASY RESCUE OPERATION.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.569
AFTER FEDERAL, STATE,
AND CITY BUDGET CUTS,

01:41.602 --> 01:44.738
THE PARK SERVICE HERE CAN ONLY
OPERATE ON WEEKENDS.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.275
THEY'VE HAD WASHOUTS
AND ROCKSLIDES

01:47.308 --> 01:48.676
ALL OVER THE TRAIL SYSTEM,

01:48.709 --> 01:49.910
MAKING THE JOB OF EVERYONE
ON THE SEARCH TEAM

01:49.943 --> 01:51.812
THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.

01:51.845 --> 01:56.184
IT'S WAY TOO EARLY TO SPECULATE
ON THE IDENTITY OF THE BODY.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.919
THE LAST THING THE L.A.P.D.
WANTS TO DO

01:58.952 --> 02:00.821
AFTER THIS FIVE-DAY ORDEAL

02:00.854 --> 02:04.792
IS TO CREATE UNNECESSARY GRIEF
FOR THE MICHAELS FAMILY.

02:04.825 --> 02:08.329
CHIEF JOHNSON, IS THIS
A MURDER INVESTIGATION?

02:09.330 --> 02:12.266
WELL, THE ARRIVAL OF
MAJOR CRIMES FROM THE L.A.P.D.

02:12.300 --> 02:15.303
SIGNALS JUST HOW VIOLENT
OF AN END THIS IS

02:15.336 --> 02:16.770
FOR ANOTHER HOLLYWOOD DREAM,

02:16.804 --> 02:19.473
AS THE MAN
FROM THE CITY OF CHURCHES

02:19.507 --> 02:22.843
ENDS HIS LIFE
IN THE CITY OF ANGELS.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.213
AND WE'RE CLEAR.

02:25.246 --> 02:28.616
I GUESS WE CAN, UH, SEND
THE RATTLESNAKE GUY HOME.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.620
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES.
WHAT A CIRCUS!

02:32.653 --> 02:34.555
WHERE'S THE BODY?
RIGHT THERE.

02:34.588 --> 02:38.659
WHICH PATROL SAYS IS ABOUT
A HUNDRED YARDS UP THIS TRAIL.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.928
AND THEN ANOTHER 200 YARDS DOWN,
AND SPLAT.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.663
YOU MEAN
HE FELL OFF A CLIFF?

02:42.696 --> 02:44.432
Tao: OR HE GOT PUSHED.
HARD TO SAY.

02:44.465 --> 02:47.335
FIRE DEPARTMENT'S WORKING
ON GETTING THEM UP AND OUT.

02:47.368 --> 02:50.404
SPECIAL AGENT HOWARD,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

02:50.438 --> 02:51.705
OH, THAT TRAIL
I JUST CAME DOWN

02:51.739 --> 02:52.906
BELONGS TO
THE NATIONAL FOREST SERVICE.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.376
YOU'RE STANDING
ON FEDERAL PROPERTY.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.445
OKAY, SO, THEN,
WHY ARE WE HERE?

02:57.478 --> 02:59.447
WELL, WHEN
MR. MICHAELS FELL,

02:59.480 --> 03:01.582
HE, UH, LANDED
IN A CITY CANYON.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.951
MIND IF WE HEAD UP THE MOUNTAIN,
TAKE A PEEK OVER THAT CLIFF?

03:03.984 --> 03:05.586
Fritz: WELL,
WE'RE ABOUT TO START CASTING

03:05.619 --> 03:06.987
MR. MICHAELS' FOOTPRINTS,

03:07.020 --> 03:08.289
AND, YOU KNOW, WE COULD USE
SOME VOLUNTEERS

03:08.322 --> 03:09.490
TO HELP CARRY UP
THE PLASTER.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.658
YEAH, RIGHT.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.760
CHIEF JOHNSON,
THE MICHAELS FAMILY,

03:12.793 --> 03:14.528
THEY'RE HERE.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.230
THANK YOU.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.931
LIEUTENANT, YOU WANT TO CARRY
PLASTER UP THE MOUNTAIN

03:17.965 --> 03:19.400
OR TALK TO THE FAMILY
WITH ME?

03:19.433 --> 03:21.602
BYE, EVERYONE.

03:25.606 --> 03:28.309
Taylor: CHIEF JOHNSON,
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,

03:28.342 --> 03:30.311
THIS IS
BOB MICHAELS' FAMILY --

03:30.344 --> 03:32.646
HIS WIFE, BETH,
HIS DAUGHTER, MISSY,

03:32.680 --> 03:34.448
HIS FATHER-IN-LAW --
I'M SORRY, SIR?

03:34.482 --> 03:35.449
WES DURANT --

03:35.483 --> 03:36.484
FORT WAYNE, INDIANA.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.751
THANK YOU.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.320
AND THIS IS BOB'S SON,
TIMMY.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.954
OH, I WASN'T AWARE
MR. MICHAELS HAD A SON.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.590
HE FORGOT ABOUT IT, TOO.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.325
NOT NOW, DAD, PLEASE.

03:44.358 --> 03:48.262
THIS MAN YOU FOUND --
IT'S NOT BOB, IS IT?

03:48.296 --> 03:49.797
WE'RE NOT SURE.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.965
BUT THIS IS SO FAR
FROM WHERE HE LEFT OUR CAR.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.534
15 MILES.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.835
AND HOW COULD HE GET
THIS CLOSE TO A ROAD

03:54.868 --> 03:55.936
AND NOT MAKE IT OUT?

03:55.969 --> 03:57.671
Missy:
YEAH, IT CAN'T BE DADDY.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.006
HE'S TOO FAR FROM THE CAR.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.309
Provenza: MISS MICHAELS,
UH, YOUR HUSBAND --

04:01.342 --> 04:03.644
HE SPEND A LOT OF TIME
OUT IN NATURE?

04:03.677 --> 04:07.848
HE TOOK MY SCOUT TROOP CAMPING
AT POKAGON STATE PARK BACK HOME.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.851
SO HE'S AN EXPERIENCED
OUTDOORSMAN?

04:10.884 --> 04:12.653
WELL,
H-HE'S NOT AN EXPERT.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.922
HE WAS -- HE WAS JUST
GOING FOR A WALK.

04:16.424 --> 04:19.793
MA'AM, YOU TOLD
THE POLICE EARLIER

04:19.827 --> 04:21.729
THAT THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW YOUR HUSBAND,

04:21.762 --> 04:23.597
HE WAS WEARING
A BLUE SHIRT?

04:25.333 --> 04:29.637
UH...BLUE POLO
WITH STRIPES. YEAH.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.840
WELL, ONE OF THE RESCUERS
FOUND THIS ON THE BODY.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.408
DOES THIS LOOK
FAMILIAR?
OH!

04:40.781 --> 04:44.352
WE ONLY
CAME OUT HERE BECAUSE OF ME.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.354
IT'S MY FAULT.
OH, NO.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.622
NO, BABY, DON'T YOU THINK THAT
FOR ONE SECOND, ALL RIGHT?

04:48.656 --> 04:50.624
WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE
LET THEM LEAVE INDIANA.

04:50.658 --> 04:53.627
EXCUSE ME.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.028
MISSY, REPORTERS ARE ASKING
FOR A STATEMENT.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.497
Wes: NO, MISSY,
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.432
YOU TELL THOSE REPORTERS
THEY CAN GO TO HELL.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.834
AND YOU CAN GO WITH THEM.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.538
MA'AM, WE NEED SOME QUIET TIME
NOW, AWAY FROM HERE.

05:04.572 --> 05:05.573
Brenda: UM, OF COURSE.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.575
WHY DON'T Y'ALL RELAX

05:07.608 --> 05:08.976
IN ONE OF OUR FAMILY ROOMS
AT THE STATION.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.411
WE CAN EVEN ARRANGE A RIDE
FOR YOU.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.479
WE HAVE A RENTAL CAR.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.481
UH, ALL RIGHT, THEN.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.983
COMMANDER, WOULD YOU PLEASE
ARRANGE AN ESCORT?
SURE.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.619
I-I'M SORRY. I KNOW
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT TIME,

05:18.652 --> 05:19.953
BUT AS SOON
AS YOU'RE ABLE,

05:19.987 --> 05:21.489
WE'RE GOING TO NEED

05:21.522 --> 05:23.924
YOUR HUSBAND'S MEDICAL
AND DENTAL RECORDS.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.526
HERE YOU GO.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.566
RIGHT THIS WAY.
RIGHT THIS WAY.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.466
Dr. Morales: I DON'T
NORMALLY DO HOUSE CALLS,

06:05.499 --> 06:07.134
BUT MY BOSS DIDN'T WANT
THE PRESS

06:07.167 --> 06:09.703
TO GET THE INFORMATION OUT
BEFORE WE DID.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.405
AND...YUCK.

06:11.439 --> 06:16.009
UH...MULTIPLE FRACTURES
OF THE LEFT LEG AND -- OHH --

06:16.043 --> 06:17.945
THAT BONE'S STICKING OUT
A LITTLE BIT.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.480
LET'S STAY AWAY
FROM THAT.

06:19.513 --> 06:20.714
SHATTERED PELVIS.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.050
CRUSHED RIBS.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.419
THIS GUY DIDN'T FALL OFF
A MOUNTAIN -- HE BOUNCED.

06:25.453 --> 06:29.557
AND WEIRD.
HIS FACE IS SUNBURNT...

06:29.590 --> 06:32.493
BUT THE REST
OF HIM ISN'T...

06:32.526 --> 06:33.661
EXCEPT FOR THE PALMS
OF HIS HANDS.

06:33.694 --> 06:34.928
WAS THE BODY
IN THE SHADE?

06:34.962 --> 06:36.930
YEAH -- UNDER A LOT
OF SCRUB BRUSH.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.198
THE BODY'S COLD,
BUT STILL STIFF,

06:38.231 --> 06:39.933
VERY LITTLE DECOM,

06:39.967 --> 06:42.803
NO BUG LARVAE
OR POSTMORTEM ANIMAL BITES.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.205
I SAY HE WAS
DOWN THERE OVERNIGHT --

06:45.238 --> 06:47.207
MAYBE 10, 12 HOURS
AT MOST.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.843
NOW, HOW DID HE MANAGE
TO WALK AROUND FOR FIVE DAYS

06:49.877 --> 06:51.078
IN A POLO SHIRT AND SHORTS

06:51.111 --> 06:52.880
AND ONLY GET SUNBURNED
ON HIS FACE?

06:52.913 --> 06:54.014
MAYBE HE HAD
SUNSCREEN ON.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.616
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

06:55.649 --> 06:56.617
TRYING TO DETERMINE
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE VICTIM.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.885
GUY'S A JUMPER, RIGHT?

06:57.918 --> 06:59.453
HE WAS OUT HERE
NEARLY A WEEK

06:59.487 --> 07:00.488
BEFORE TAKING THE LEAP.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.955
WHY THE WAIT?

07:01.989 --> 07:03.991
MAYBE HE, UH, STUMBLED OFF
THE CLIFF IN THE DARK,

07:04.024 --> 07:07.127
OR HE GOT SO LOST
THAT HE GAVE UP ALL HOPE.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.862
LOOK, IT'S HARD TO THINK
OF THIS GUY AS A GENIUS.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.198
COME ON. YOU HAVE AN IMPORTANT
SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE

07:11.231 --> 07:12.900
IN LIKE AN HOUR

07:12.933 --> 07:14.668
THAT COULD END THIS WHOLE
MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR LAWSUIT

07:14.702 --> 07:16.203
AGAINST THE CITY,
THE DEPARTMENT, YOU, ME.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.771
WE, UH, GO RIGHT NOW,

07:17.805 --> 07:18.972
WE CAN HITCH A RIDE
ON A RESCUE CHOPPER.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.941
NO. HANG ON.

07:20.974 --> 07:24.111
THIS REDNESS
IS NOT FROM A SUNBURN.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.713
OH!

07:25.746 --> 07:27.715
OUT! OUT! EVERYBODY, OUT!

07:27.748 --> 07:29.149
Provenza:
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!

07:29.182 --> 07:31.051
OUT!

07:31.084 --> 07:32.486
DON'T RUB! DON'T RUB!

07:32.520 --> 07:33.821
YOU'LL MAKE IT WORSE.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.122
BRENDA!
WHAT?!

07:35.155 --> 07:36.624
WHAT IS IT?!

07:36.657 --> 07:38.158
PEPPER SPRAY
ON THE VICTIM'S FACE.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.827
THE WATER I USED
REACTIVATED IT.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.062
MEDIC,
PEPPER SPRAY WIPES!

07:42.095 --> 07:45.699
PEPPER SPRAY?!
WHO WOULD PEPPER

07:54.842 --> 07:56.677
Brenda: THESE ARE
THE VICTIM'S FOOTPRINTS,

07:56.710 --> 07:57.811
COURTESY OF THE FBI.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.547
NOTICE ANYTHING?

07:59.580 --> 08:00.614
HE'S DRAGGING HIS HEELS?

08:00.648 --> 08:01.782
NO, IT LOOKS THAT WAY

08:01.815 --> 08:03.050
BECAUSE HE WAS
PUSHED TO HERE,

08:03.083 --> 08:04.852
WHERE IT SAYS
"EDGE OF CLIFF."

08:07.020 --> 08:08.689
SO HE WENT OFF
THE CLIFF BACKWARDS?

08:08.722 --> 08:11.124
WITH A BIG SHOVE AND A LITTLE
PEPPER SPRAY -- YES.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.259
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE
HE WAS PUSHED?

08:12.292 --> 08:14.127
BECAUSE THE FBI TOLD ME

08:14.161 --> 08:17.097
THAT ALL THE OTHER FOOTPRINTS
AROUND HIS WERE BRUSHED AWAY.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.499
COME IN.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.638
GOOD AFTERNOON.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.039
GOOD TO SEE EVERYONE
IN ONE PLACE.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.911
WE JUST PASSED GOLDMAN
SITTING OUTSIDE.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.013
LOOKING VERY SMUG.
SOMETHING WRONG?

08:33.046 --> 08:34.748
OH, IT'S JUST
PEPPER SPRAY.

08:34.782 --> 08:37.217
LOOK,
NO OFFICER-INVOLVED VIOLENCE.
NO ONE WAS ATTACKED.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.987
YEAH.
SOMEONE ATTACKED BOB MICHAELS.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.321
OR MAYBE
HE SPRAYED HIMSELF,

08:41.354 --> 08:43.090
TRYING TO FEND OFF,
UH, WHATEVER --

08:43.123 --> 08:45.225
A RACCOON OR A SKUNK.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.060
ON THE SUBJECT OF SKUNKS,

08:47.094 --> 08:50.263
GOLDMAN'S OFFER HAS ALREADY BEEN
APPROVED BY THE CITY ATTORNEY,

08:50.297 --> 08:51.899
AND NOW IT'S OUR TURN
TO TAKE A LOOK.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.167
Gavin: GOLDMAN IS GONNA TRY
TO MAKE THIS SETTLEMENT

08:54.201 --> 08:55.769
SOUND LIKE A MIRACLE CURE,

08:55.803 --> 08:58.606
SO DON'T GET TOO EXCITED
WHEN YOU HEAR IT, OKAY?

08:58.639 --> 08:59.707
OKAY.
OKAY.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.274
OKAY.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.810
MR. GOLDMAN, COME IN, PLEASE.

09:04.612 --> 09:07.080
I THINK YOU'VE MET EVERYONE.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.181
WAS IT SOMETHING I SAID?

09:08.215 --> 09:10.684
PEPPER SPRAY.

09:10.718 --> 09:11.885
SORRY WE CAN'T OFFER YOU ANY.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.723
WE'RE ANXIOUS TO HEAR
ABOUT THE SETTLEMENT.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.592
I HAVE GOOD NEWS,
FOLLOWED BY EVEN BETTER NEWS.

09:18.626 --> 09:20.828
THE BAYLOR FAMILY
HAS AGREED

09:20.861 --> 09:25.733
TO LOWER THE CLAIM
FROM $20 MILLION TO $500,000.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.607
I KNOW.

09:33.641 --> 09:36.777
NOT EVERY DAY
YOU GET A 97h% DISCOUNT.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.213
THAT DOES SOUND LIKE
GOOD NEWS.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.616
MM-HMM. MM-HMM.
SO WHAT'S THE BETTER NEWS?

09:43.917 --> 09:45.919
IF YOU AGREE
TO THE SETTLEMENT,

09:45.953 --> 09:47.788
THE BAYLOR FAMILY

09:47.821 --> 09:50.257
WILL DROP THEIR CLAIM
OF WRONGFUL DEATH

09:50.290 --> 09:51.859
AGAINST CHIEF JOHNSON.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.196
IN EXCHANGE FOR WHAT?

09:56.229 --> 09:58.732
SORRY?

09:58.766 --> 10:01.702
WELL, YOU'VE MADE THE SUN SHINE.
NOW TELL US ABOUT THE RAIN.

10:03.203 --> 10:06.006
THERE IS SOME LANGUAGE

10:06.039 --> 10:08.275
WHICH STIPULATES
DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON

10:08.308 --> 10:12.312
WAS UNCONCERNED WITH
TERRELL BAYLOR'S WELFARE

10:12.345 --> 10:13.814
WHEN SHE DROPPED HIM OFF.

10:13.847 --> 10:16.083
MM...LANGUAGE
IS A MAGICAL THING.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.953
YOU WILL ALSO NOTE

10:19.987 --> 10:24.124
THAT I HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY
LOWERED MY CONTINGENCY FEES.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.859
THIS HAS NEVER
BEEN ABOUT MONEY.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.394
IT'S ABOUT RIGHTING A WRONG

10:27.427 --> 10:30.230
AND GETTING MRS. BAYLOR
A NEW HOUSE

10:30.263 --> 10:32.132
SO SHE'S NOT FORCED TO LIVE

10:32.165 --> 10:33.867
WHERE HER SON
WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED.

10:35.468 --> 10:39.106
AND THIS OFFER
DOES ALL OF THAT

10:39.139 --> 10:43.243
WITHOUT SINGLING ANYONE OUT
FOR BLAME.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.445
SO...

10:45.478 --> 10:49.683
READ IT, PLEASE,
EVERY WORD,

10:49.717 --> 10:51.852
UNDER A MICROSCOPE.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.187
AND YOU'RE WELCOME.

10:54.221 --> 10:57.090
THANKS.
WE'LL CONFER.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.727
I WAS KIND OF HOPING
WE COULD SETTLE THIS TODAY.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.295
OH, SORRY TO DISAPPOINT.
BUH-BYE.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.467
FINE.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.971
I'LL EXPECT AN ANSWER
BY MIDNIGHT TOMORROW.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.873
CHIEF JOHNSON.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.817
Pope: WELL, I CAN SEE WHY
THE CITY LOVES THIS OFFER.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.920
I MEAN, 500 GRAND
INSTEAD OF $20 MILLION,

11:26.954 --> 11:28.989
AND NO ONE IS REASSIGNED,
RIGHT?

11:29.022 --> 11:30.958
NO ONE'S CULPABLE?

11:30.991 --> 11:32.492
IT STILL SAYS I DIDN'T CARE
WHAT HAPPENED TO TERRELL BAYLOR.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.862
THAT'S OKAY. NOBODY CARED
ABOUT HIM UNTIL HE DIED.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.864
GAVIN, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:36.897 --> 11:39.366
WELL, THE AGREEMENT
APPEARS REASONABLE,

11:39.399 --> 11:41.068
BUT I'M NOT GONNA PRESSURE
MY CLIENT

11:41.101 --> 11:43.804
INTO SIGNING A POTENTIALLY
LIFE-CHANGING DOCUMENT

11:43.837 --> 11:45.005
IN THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.473
Pope:
WELL, THEN ALLOW ME.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.241
CHIEF JOHNSON, LET'S GET
THIS CIVIL SUIT OVER WITH,

11:48.275 --> 11:51.111
AND I'LL TAKE US ALL OUT
FOR A CELEBRATORY DRINK.

11:51.144 --> 11:54.982
THE MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
IS SET TO BE ARGUED NEXT WEEK.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.017
I CAN WIN IT.
I WILL WIN IT.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.352
THIS AGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES
AS MUCH.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.888
GOLDMAN IS DESPERATE.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.823
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO
CELEBRATE PAYING $500,000

12:02.856 --> 12:04.491
FOR SOMETHING
YOU COULD GET FOR FREE?

12:04.524 --> 12:07.027
WHAT IF YOU'RE WRONG

12:07.060 --> 12:09.129
AND THE JUDGE DECIDES
TO TRY THIS CASE?

12:09.162 --> 12:11.131
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO
YOUR CLIENT THEN?

12:11.164 --> 12:12.365
I DON'T THINK
ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE

12:12.399 --> 12:14.301
BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN
TO MY CLIENT.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.402
CAN YOU SAY THE SAME?

12:15.435 --> 12:16.870
NO. DIDN'T THINK SO.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.806
YEAH. COME IN.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.841
EXCUSE ME, UH, CHIEFS,

12:20.874 --> 12:23.043
UH, BUT THE MICHAELS FAMILY
IS DOWNSTAIRS

12:23.076 --> 12:25.045
CRASHING COMMANDER TAYLOR'S
PRESS CONFERENCE.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.947
WHAT?! OH!

12:28.281 --> 12:30.250
Missy:
YEAH, I JUST WANT TO SAY,

12:30.283 --> 12:32.019
MY FIRST VIDEO CAME OUT
LAST WEEK,

12:32.052 --> 12:33.486
AND DADDY WAS
REALLY PROUD OF IT.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.322
HE WOULDN'T HURT HIMSELF.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.857
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.091
HE DID NOT JUMP OFF THAT CLIFF.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.860
Bruno:
AS MISSY'S MANAGER,

12:39.893 --> 12:43.030
I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW
THAT WE WILL NOT STAND BY

12:43.063 --> 12:45.165
AND ALLOW THE POLICE
OR ANYONE ELSE

12:45.198 --> 12:46.533
DISHONOR BOB'S MEMORY

12:46.566 --> 12:48.802
BY IMPLYING
THAT HE KILLED HIMSELF.

12:48.836 --> 12:51.271
NOW, I WANT TO THANK
THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE...

12:51.304 --> 12:53.941
COMMANDER, BRING THOSE PEOPLE
UP HERE RIGHT NOW.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.342
PLEASE.
...WHO HAVE SHOWN SUPPORT
TO THIS FAMILY

12:55.375 --> 12:56.877
DURING THIS TUMULTUOUS TIME.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.379
UH, MR. DURANT, WHERE'S
THE REST OF YOUR FAMILY?

12:59.412 --> 13:01.815
MY GRANDDAUGHTER'S MANAGER,
THAT BRUNO,

13:01.849 --> 13:03.083
WOULDN'T LET THEM COME.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.384
WHY?

13:04.417 --> 13:06.086
SAID THEY WERE LATE
FOR ANOTHER INTERVIEW.

13:06.119 --> 13:09.122
THAT IDIOT, BOB, SPENT
EVERY DIME THEY EVER HAD

13:09.156 --> 13:10.523
TRYING TO BECOME FAMOUS.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.392
WELL, NOW, FINALLY HE'S THE STAR
OF HIS OWN TV SHOW.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.394
YOUR SON-IN-LAW
WANTED TO BE FAMOUS, TOO?

13:14.427 --> 13:16.196
I THOUGHT IT WAS
YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER

13:16.229 --> 13:17.931
WITH THE BIG DREAMS.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.233
BOB HAD HIS EYE ON HOLLYWOOD
SINCE THE DAY I MET HIM.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.369
A FEW YEARS AFTER
HE MARRIED MY DAUGHTER,

13:22.402 --> 13:24.037
I BOUGHT THEM A HOUSE,

13:24.071 --> 13:26.840
THINKING IT MIGHT HELP THEM
PUT DOWN ROOTS, SETTLE DOWN.

13:26.874 --> 13:29.076
INSTEAD, HE QUIT HIS JOB,
SHAVED HIS HEAD,

13:29.109 --> 13:31.211
AND DID "THE KING AND ME"
IN THE PARK.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.479
"THE KING AND I."

13:32.512 --> 13:34.314
YEAH, AND WHEN
HE WASN'T DISCOVERED,

13:34.347 --> 13:36.483
BECAUSE HOLLYWOOD
DOESN'T SEND TALENT SCOUTS

13:36.516 --> 13:37.550
OUT TO FORT WAYNE,

13:37.584 --> 13:39.152
HE PUSHED MISSY
ON THE STAGE

13:39.186 --> 13:40.520
AND STARTED LIVING
THROUGH HER,

13:40.553 --> 13:42.856
TELLING HER SHE WAS GONNA BE
A MOVIE STAR.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.457
MR. DURANT,
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

13:44.491 --> 13:47.127
WHY YOUR SON-IN-LAW WAS
AT THE TOP OF THAT MOUNTAIN

13:47.160 --> 13:48.128
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

13:48.161 --> 13:49.462
I DON'T KNOW.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.331
MISSY HAD A TRYOUT
THAT AFTERNOON.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.966
IT WASN'T LIKE HIM

13:53.000 --> 13:54.301
TO EVER MISS
ONE OF THOSE THINGS.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.903
HE NEVER SKIPPED
A SINGLE AUDITION.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.871
I DO KNOW HE CALLED
AND ASKED

13:57.905 --> 14:00.040
FOR HIS OLD JOB BACK
IN FORT WAYNE.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.909
BOSS SAID,
"NOTHIN' DOIN'."

14:01.942 --> 14:04.311
I DON'T KNOW -- MAYBE BOB
WOKE UP THE OTHER MORNING,

14:04.344 --> 14:08.215
REALIZED HE WAS OUT OF GAS
AND...JUMPED SHIP.

14:08.248 --> 14:11.551
YEAH, BUT HE HAD ONLY
BEEN DEAD FOR --

14:11.584 --> 14:14.621
UH, COMMANDER, LET'S NOT
UPSET MR. DURANT WITH
DETAILS LIKE THAT.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.656
I'M SO SORRY.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.959
UM, YOU WERE
SAYING THAT...

14:18.992 --> 14:21.194
YOU THOUGHT THAT BOB
KILLED HIMSELF?

14:21.228 --> 14:23.496
WELL, HE WASN'T EXACTLY
THE RESPONSIBLE TYPE, YOU KNOW.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.998
WHEN THEY CAME OUT HERE,

14:25.032 --> 14:26.499
HE LEFT TIMMY BEHIND WITH US
IN FORT WAYNE.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.168
THE BOY'S STILL
IN GRADE SCHOOL.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.170
DID YOUR DAUGHTER DISAGREE
WITH THAT DECISION?

14:30.203 --> 14:32.039
OH, BETH NEVER SAW SENSE
WHEN IT CAME TO BOB,

14:32.072 --> 14:33.440
EVER SINCE THEY DID
A PLAY TOGETHER.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.042
YOUR DAUGHTER'S
AN ACTOR, TOO?

14:35.075 --> 14:37.010
NO, NO.
THEY'RE ALL, UH --

14:37.044 --> 14:38.511
WHAT DO YOU CALL THEM?
AMATEURS --

14:38.545 --> 14:41.081
BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF
BY THAT MEXICAN.

14:41.114 --> 14:44.051
ACTUALLY, CHIEF, BRUNO'S
AS AMERICAN AS THEY COME.

14:44.084 --> 14:47.354
HE RUNS AN ONLINE MUSIC VIDEO
BUSINESS, AIMED AT...

14:47.387 --> 14:50.690
HOLLYWOOD NEWCOMERS.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.392
YEAH, WELL,
WHATEVER BRUNO IS,

14:52.425 --> 14:55.195
HE HAD BETH AND BOB
THINKING THIS WHOLE VIDEO THING

14:55.228 --> 14:57.998
WAS GONNA TURN MISSY
INTO THE NEXT DEBBY BOONE.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.233
HE'S BEHIND ALL OF THIS.
YOU WAIT AND SEE.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.634
TALK TO BRUNO.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.571
HE RUNS THE SHOW
AROUND HERE.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.441
Bruno: JUST WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH
THE FAMILY APPRECIATES

15:08.475 --> 15:11.078
EVERYTHING YOU PEOPLE HAVE DONE
IN THIS TERRIBLE TIME.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.179
CAN'T SAY THAT ENOUGH.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.713
WELL, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.482
AND I SURE DO LOVE
THAT SONG.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.685
IS IT TRUE YOU WROTE IT?
WHAT'S IT CALLED?

15:18.718 --> 15:21.188
"DADDY, SAY YES."
YEAH. I WROTE IT.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.956
THANK YOU.
I'M GLAD YOU LIKED IT.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.557
SUNK A LOT OF MONEY
INTO THAT VIDEO, TOO,

15:24.591 --> 15:25.592
BUT MISSY'S WORTH IT.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.726
Gabriel: I'M SURE.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.628
SO, MR. PEREZ,

15:28.661 --> 15:30.663
WE'RE INVESTIGATING
MR. MICHAELS' DEATH, AND --
I KNOW.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.233
AND YOU HAVE TO START ADMITTING
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,

15:33.266 --> 15:35.668
INSTEAD OF ACTING LIKE
HE OFFED HIMSELF.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.370
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING?

15:37.404 --> 15:40.040
WELL, YOU'RE BEING VERY TIGHT
WITH THE DETAILS.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.142
AND IN THIS
NEW MEDIA ENVIRONMENT --

15:42.175 --> 15:44.111
WHICH IS VERY DIFFICULT TO
EXPLAIN TO SOMEONE YOUR AGE --

15:44.144 --> 15:46.013
MISSY'S ABOUT
TO BECOME A STAR.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.715
SO GOING AROUND SAYING
HER DAD JUMPED OFF A CLIFF

15:48.748 --> 15:51.451
BECAUSE HE GAMBLED EVERYTHING HE
HAD ON HER AND THOUGHT HE LOST,

15:51.484 --> 15:52.685
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.088
I MEAN, I TOTALLY GET
IT LOOKS BETTER

15:55.122 --> 15:56.756
FOR YOU GUYS
TO CALL IT A SUICIDE,

15:56.789 --> 15:58.591
BUT WHY SHOULD MISSY
BE PUNISHED

15:58.625 --> 16:01.528
BECAUSE IT TOOK YOU
FIVE DAYS TO FIND HIM?

16:01.561 --> 16:02.562
IT'S NOT HER FAULT.

16:04.164 --> 16:08.001
WELL, MR. PEREZ,
WE'D LOVE TO...CHANGE OUR TUNE,

16:08.035 --> 16:11.171
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT
TALKING TO MISSY AND HER MOM.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.240
SO, IF YOU CAN'T ARRANGE --
NOT TODAY.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.408
I BOOKED THEM FOR
AN EAST COAST MORNING SHOW,

16:15.442 --> 16:17.544
WHICH MEANS THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT HERE.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.446
AND MISSY'S GONNA HAVE
A HARD TIME AS IT IS,

16:19.479 --> 16:22.182
TRYING TO GET SOME SLEEP,
SO I HAVE TO PROTECT HER.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.716
PROTECT HER BY PUSHING HER
TO DO INTERVIEWS

16:23.750 --> 16:25.352
THE DAY HER FATHER
WAS FOUND DEAD?

16:25.385 --> 16:28.388
WELL, AMERICA WATCHED WHAT
HAPPENED TO BOB THIS WEEK.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.490
THE WHOLE COUNTRY'S
IN MOURNING.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.625
AND YOU KNOW WHO SHOWS UP
WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN MOURNING?

16:32.659 --> 16:34.461
THE POLICE.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.763
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE SHOWS UP?
LAWYERS.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.534
OKAY. OKAY.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.403
YOU LIKE INTERVIEWS?
SO DO I.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.805
AND WHEN I STEP OUTSIDE
AND TELL THESE REPORTERS

16:45.838 --> 16:49.042
THAT YOU AND MISSY ARE REFUSING
TO COOPERATE WITH THE POLICE

16:49.076 --> 16:50.610
IN THIS INVESTIGATION,

16:50.643 --> 16:53.046
THEY'RE GONNA JUMP TO
CONCLUSIONS WORSE THAN SUICIDE.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.683
YOU FEEL ME?

16:59.352 --> 17:00.587
UH...

17:00.620 --> 17:03.323
SO YOU ONLY WANT TO TALK
TO THE FAMILY.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.824
LOOK, BRUNO,

17:04.857 --> 17:07.160
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
REQUIRE

17:07.194 --> 17:09.629
THAT MISSY AND HER MOM
SIGN A STATEMENT

17:09.662 --> 17:11.531
SAYING THAT THEY BELIEVE
THAT MR. MICHAELS' DEATH

17:11.564 --> 17:13.333
WAS AN ACCIDENT.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.236
OTHERWISE, IT'S SUICIDE.

17:16.269 --> 17:19.306
UNDERSTAND?

17:21.308 --> 17:22.842
OKAY.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.444
FOR MISSY'S NEXT VIDEO,

17:24.477 --> 17:27.080
IF YOU CAN GET ME FOOTAGE
OF BOB'S BODY

17:27.114 --> 17:29.182
BEING LIFTED OUT
BY HELICOPTER,

17:29.216 --> 17:31.584
I'LL HAVE THEM HERE
TOMORROW MORNING.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.754
DONE.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.424
THEN WE'RE ON
THE SAME PAGE.

17:37.457 --> 17:38.525
HEY.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.560
REALLY GREAT
TO MEET YOU BOTH.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.095
DID I GIVE YOU MY CARD?
YOU DID.

17:42.129 --> 17:43.630
AWESOME. GREAT.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.366
THANK YOU
FOR ALL YOU DO.

17:47.534 --> 17:48.601
TAKE CARE.
BUH-BYE.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.404
BUH-BYE.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.140
NICE SUIT.
THANK YOU.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.809
"GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS"?

17:56.843 --> 17:58.845
I'M SURE
THEY EXIST SOMEWHERE.

17:58.878 --> 18:01.448
LOOK, IF BOB MICHAELS
COMMITTED SUICIDE,

18:01.481 --> 18:03.650
WHY DID HE WANDER AROUND FOR
SO LONG BEFORE TAKING THE LEAP?

18:03.683 --> 18:05.318
LOOK, RIGHT NOW
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES

18:05.352 --> 18:07.187
WHO KNOW HOW LONG MR. MICHAELS
WAS ACTUALLY DEAD.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.821
SO LET THEM THINK
WE'RE INVESTIGATING A SUICIDE

18:08.855 --> 18:09.856
UNTIL WE KNOW BETTER.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.892
CHIEF, I JUST SPOKE
TO DR. MORALES

18:12.925 --> 18:15.228
ABOUT THE STOMACH CONTENTS
OF OUR VICTIM,

18:15.262 --> 18:16.396
AND, UH --

18:16.429 --> 18:19.466
HUH --
BRUNO DOES BAT MITZVAHS?

18:19.499 --> 18:20.433
LIEUTENANT.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.135
HUH?
OH, RIGHT, YEAH.

18:22.169 --> 18:24.137
MR. MICHAELS,
MISSING FOR FIVE DAYS,

18:24.171 --> 18:26.673
HAD JUST EATEN SOME KIND
OF BLUE CANDY AND A PIZZA.

18:26.706 --> 18:30.277
SO, WHAT, HE GOT LOST
ON MOUNT PEPPERONI?

18:30.310 --> 18:33.546
HE WASN'T LOST.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.783
HE WAS NEVER LOST.

18:36.816 --> 18:39.186
UH, LOOK, DETECTIVE,

18:39.219 --> 18:40.887
I WANT A FULL FINANCIAL
ON THE FAMILY, PLEASE.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.722
AND FIND OUT EVERYTHING
YOU CAN ABOUT BRUNO

18:42.755 --> 18:43.723
AND HIS SLIMY BUSINESS.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.792
THANK YOU.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.760
YOU KNOW, BRUNO WRITES
"DADDY, SAY YES,"

18:47.794 --> 18:50.897
DADDY FAKES DISAPPEARING,
SONG BECOMES A HIT.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.665
YOU GOT TO ADMIT --
IT'S PRETTY BRILLIANT.

18:52.699 --> 18:58.271
EXCEPT I SERIOUSLY DOUBT
THAT DADDY SAID YES TO DYING.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.944
MISSY MICHAELS' SINGLE
"DADDY, SAY YES"

19:04.977 --> 19:06.613
HAS BROKEN INTO
THE TOP-10 MUSIC DOWNLOADS

19:06.646 --> 19:08.781
FOLLOWING HER FATHER'S
TRAGIC ACCIDENT,

19:08.815 --> 19:11.351
A BIT OF COMFORT FOR THE FOLKS
GATHERING HERE

19:11.384 --> 19:13.386
IN THE FORT WAYNE
THEATER COMMUNITY.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.754
* DADDY... *

19:14.787 --> 19:17.190
Brenda:
IT'S ONLY A BIT OF COMFORT

19:17.224 --> 19:18.725
IF YOU BELIEVE THAT BOB MICHAELS
FOUND A FRESH PIZZA

19:18.758 --> 19:20.627
ON A MOUNTAIN TRAIL ONE HOUR
BEFORE HE WAS PEPPER-SPRAYED

19:20.660 --> 19:22.829
AND SHOVED OFF THE SIDE OF
A CLIFF BY THE INVISIBLE MAN.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.965
IT'S SO FRUSTRATING YOU COULDN'T
FIND THE FOOTPRINTS.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.368
THERE ARE TOO MANY FEET
ON THE TRAIL TO TELL WHO'S WHO.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.836
AND OBVIOUSLY,
SOMEBODY NEATENED UP

19:29.869 --> 19:31.271
NEAR THE EDGE
OF THE CLIFF.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.439
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

19:32.472 --> 19:33.740
OH! IF I HEAR
THAT SONG AGAIN,

19:33.773 --> 19:35.475
I'M GONNA JUMP OFF
A CLIFF.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.610
GOT TO ADMIT,
IT'S KIND OF CATCHY.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.479
SO'S THE FLU.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.649
YOU SHOULD SEE THE CONTRACT
THAT BRUNO USES

19:42.682 --> 19:44.384
TO FOOL THESE PARENTS.

19:44.417 --> 19:47.854
THEY PAY $4,000 FOR A SONG
AND A MUSIC VIDEO,

19:47.887 --> 19:49.922
BUT THEN HE GETS 80%
OF THE PROCEEDS.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.791
IT'S A TOTAL SCAM.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.561
SOUNDS KIND OF LIKE THIS
BLAMELESS SETTLEMENT OFFER.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.296
YOU REALLY WANT
TO SIGN THIS?

19:56.329 --> 19:57.564
I'VE READ IT
OVER AND OVER,

19:57.597 --> 19:59.699
AND I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING
THAT LOCKS ME

19:59.732 --> 20:02.602
OR THE L.A.P.D. INTO LIABILITY
FOR TERRELL'S DEATH.

20:02.635 --> 20:03.903
YEAH, WELL, HOW ABOUT

20:03.936 --> 20:06.406
"BY RELEASING HIM
IN HOSTILE SURROUNDINGS,

20:06.439 --> 20:09.309
"DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON
DEMONSTRATED

20:09.342 --> 20:10.643
"A LACK OF
PROFESSIONAL CONCERN...

20:10.677 --> 20:12.412
...FOR THE SAFETY
OF THE PLAINTIFF'S SON"?

20:12.445 --> 20:13.813
WELL...

20:13.846 --> 20:15.482
IT DOESN'T SAY
I ARRANGED HIS MURDER,

20:15.515 --> 20:16.849
WHICH IS WHAT
IT USED TO SAY.

20:16.883 --> 20:20.520
BESIDES, GAVIN SAID
IT WAS A REASONABLE OFFER.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.922
YOU TOLD ME GAVIN SAID
IT APPEARS

20:22.955 --> 20:25.592
TO BE A REASONABLE OFFER --
APPEARS.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.527
SOMETIMES THINGS ARE
AS THEY APPEAR TO BE.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.596
LIFE DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE
SO COMPLICATED.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.001
I'M SORRY.
MY NAME'S FRITZ HOWARD.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.603
WHO ARE YOU?

20:36.636 --> 20:40.873
THE PERSON WHO CAN END
THIS CIVIL SUIT FOR EVERYBODY.

20:40.907 --> 20:44.711
WHY DON'T WE WAIT TO SEE
WHAT GAVIN HAS TO SAY?

20:44.744 --> 20:46.379
I KNOW WHAT GAVIN
HAS TO SAY.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.848
HE'S CERTAIN HE CAN WIN THE
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT,

20:48.881 --> 20:51.017
BUT IT'S NOT HIS LIFE
ON THE LINE, IT'S MINE.

20:51.050 --> 20:54.721
A-A-AND I WANT THINGS
TO GO BACK TO NORMAL.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.523
RIGHT NOW.

20:56.556 --> 20:59.025
ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN LIVE
WITH THIS?

20:59.058 --> 21:02.595
I THINK I HAVE TO.

21:11.638 --> 21:14.374
I'M GETTING READY FOR BED.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.001
Brenda: STRAIGHT TO
CHIEF POPE, PLEASE?

21:42.034 --> 21:43.336
THANK YOU.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.004
HEY, CHIEF.
I'M ALMOST FINISHED.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.474
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

21:47.507 --> 21:50.443
"CERTIFICATE
OF ACCIDENTAL DEATH."

21:50.477 --> 21:52.912
YOU'RE RIGHT!
THAT FONT IS REALLY NICE.

21:52.945 --> 21:54.514
I ALSO ADDED A LINE

21:54.547 --> 21:56.649
SO BRUNO COULD SIGN ON
AS A THIRD-PARTY WITNESS.

21:56.683 --> 21:58.985
OH, GOOD. THAT'LL MAKE HIM FEEL
LIKE HE'S STILL IN CHARGE.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.388
I HAVE EVERYONE'S
FINANCIAL RECORDS.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.656
STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE
MR. MICHAELS WAS HIDING

22:03.690 --> 22:05.758
FOR FIVE DAYS
IF HE WASN'T IN THE PARK,

22:05.792 --> 22:08.561
BUT...I FOUND
THE PEPPER SPRAY.

22:08.595 --> 22:09.929
YOU DID?

22:09.962 --> 22:12.565
BRUNO ORDERED IT
OFF THE INTERNET

22:12.599 --> 22:13.933
TWO DAYS AFTER THE MICHAELS
CAME TO HOLLYWOOD.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.602
YEAH, PROBABLY BOUGHT IT
FOR HIMSELF.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.036
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

22:17.069 --> 22:18.438
BRUNO'S HAD FIVE COMPLAINTS
FILED AGAINST HIM.

22:18.471 --> 22:19.639
UH, MAD DADS.

22:19.672 --> 22:20.973
THEY DON'T SEEM
TO LIKE THE WAY

22:21.007 --> 22:22.842
THAT BRUNO BEHAVED
WITH THEIR DAUGHTERS.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.444
ANY ARRESTS?

22:24.477 --> 22:25.912
NO. GIRLS WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING
AGAINST HIM.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.146
OF COURSE NOT.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.882
HE WAS GONNA MAKE THEM
ALL FAMOUS.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.584
WHEN'S THE FAMILY
GETTING HERE?

22:31.618 --> 22:34.020
TAYLOR'S ON HIS WAY UP WITH THEM
RIGHT NOW...AND BRUNO.

22:34.053 --> 22:35.822
OKAY. THANK YOU.
UH, BUZZ,

22:35.855 --> 22:37.156
WOULD YOU PLEASE LOWER THE
SCREEN OVER THE MURDER BOARD?

22:37.189 --> 22:38.491
AND WHERE'S THAT
ACCIDENTAL

22:42.462 --> 22:45.965
Taylor: AND IF I CAN GET
YOUR AUTOGRAPH RIGHT...HERE.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.568
YOU BETTER WATCH OUT,
YOUNG LADY.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.437
YOU'RE GETTING SO FAMOUS,

22:50.470 --> 22:53.139
I MIGHT BE TEMPTED
TO SELL THAT ON eBAY.

22:53.172 --> 22:54.140
Shh!

22:56.042 --> 22:58.010
VERY GOOD.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.580
NOW, ONE LAST PAGE.
Bruno: HOLD ON.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.415
THIS IS, UH --
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? --

23:02.449 --> 23:03.916
THE THING THEY SAY
ON TELEVISION?

23:03.950 --> 23:05.652
IT'S THE MIRANDA
REQUIREMENT.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.654
IT STATES THAT YOU HAVE BEEN
ADVISED OF YOUR RIGHTS.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.789
YEAH. I CAN READ.
WHAT'S IT FOR?

23:09.822 --> 23:13.626
OH, THE STATE WON'T VERIFY
THE ACCIDENTAL-DEATH REPORT

23:13.660 --> 23:16.162
WITHOUT A WAIVER OF RIGHTS,
MR. PEREZ,

23:16.195 --> 23:18.898
WHICH MEANS WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO RELEASE MR. MICHAELS' BODY.

23:18.931 --> 23:21.100
IT'S FINE.
WE'RE SIGNING IT.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.903
HE'S RIGHT. I WANT TO GET BOB
HOME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

23:25.838 --> 23:26.806
OH. HERE Y'ALL ARE.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.174
OH, COMMANDER TAYLOR,

23:28.207 --> 23:29.742
WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE THEM
TO MY CONFERENCE ROOM?

23:29.776 --> 23:31.110
IT'S SO MUCH BIGGER.

23:31.143 --> 23:32.745
Taylor: OH,
I DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU

23:32.779 --> 23:34.714
WITH ALL THE PAPERWORK
AND...

23:34.747 --> 23:35.748
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.016
I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH

23:37.049 --> 23:39.118
FOR COMING IN
AND TAKING CARE OF THIS.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.754
AND, AGAIN, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR HOW THINGS TURNED OUT.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.523
IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.

23:43.556 --> 23:47.093
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE
KEEP TELLING ME.

23:47.126 --> 23:49.829
THE ONLY THING LEFT
IS THE PATHOLOGY TIMELINE.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.063
THE WHAT?

23:51.097 --> 23:53.199
IS THAT SOMETHING
ABOUT ALL THE THINGS

23:53.232 --> 23:55.802
THAT HAPPENED LEADING UP
TO WHEN DADDY DIED?

23:55.835 --> 23:58.505
OH. SOMEBODY'S
BEEN WATCHING "C.S.I."

23:58.538 --> 24:00.006
EXACTLY RIGHT, MISSY.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.542
WE NEED TO CHECK
WHAT WE FOUND SCIENTIFICALLY

24:02.575 --> 24:04.611
AGAINST WHAT YOU REMEMBER
OF THE DAYS

24:04.644 --> 24:06.212
LEADING UP TO YOUR
FATHER'S DISAPPEARANCE.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.147
YOU KNOW WHAT, MISSY?

24:08.180 --> 24:11.484
WHY DON'T YOU, YOUR MOTHER,
AND YOUR GRANDFATHER

24:11.518 --> 24:12.719
FOLLOW COMMANDER TAYLOR HERE.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.787
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT ABOUT ME?

24:14.821 --> 24:16.656
OH, MR. PEREZ,
I'M SO SORRY,

24:16.689 --> 24:19.926
BUT THE PATHOLOGY TIMELINE IS
STRICTLY FOR IMMEDIATE FAMILY.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.228
I KNOW THAT THE MICHAELS
THINK OF YOU THAT WAY,

24:22.261 --> 24:23.563
BUT THE LAW DOES NOT.

24:24.931 --> 24:28.701
Hey. You're handling this
like a pro.

24:28.735 --> 24:32.004
Poppy and Mom want to go back
to Fort Wayne tonight.

24:32.038 --> 24:33.239
It's a short trip.

24:33.272 --> 24:35.107
We'll work around it.
Okay?

24:37.644 --> 24:40.012
OH.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.081
MISSY IS SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU
LOOKING OUT FOR HER.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.583
OH, STOP.
I JUST...

24:43.616 --> 24:45.518
I JUST PROVIDE
THE OPPORTUNITY.

24:45.552 --> 24:46.919
THE STAR TURN
IS UP TO THE GIRL.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.755
YOU CAN'T TEACH CHARISMA,

24:48.788 --> 24:50.657
BUT, YOU KNOW,
MOMS AND DADS CAN BE PUSHY.

24:50.690 --> 24:51.658
LIKE BOB?

24:51.691 --> 24:52.925
YEAH.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.961
THE BIG SINGING EXPERT
FROM INDIANA.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.964
ON TOP OF TAKING MISSY TO
EVERY AUDITION I GOT FOR HER,

24:57.997 --> 24:59.165
MAKING HER SO NERVOUS,

24:59.198 --> 25:01.568
GUY WAS AN ABSOLUTE ZERO
ON CAMERA.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.836
AND THAT DIDN'T STOP HIM FROM
WANTING TO BE IN MISSY'S VIDEO.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.237
WHATEVER.

25:05.271 --> 25:06.939
I MADE IT WORK WITH HIM.

25:06.973 --> 25:08.107
LIKE YOU DID WITH ALL
THE OTHER FATHERS, YOU MEAN?

25:08.140 --> 25:10.577
WHAT OTHER FATHERS?

25:10.610 --> 25:12.211
WELL, THE ONES WHO CALLED
THE L.A.P.D.

25:12.244 --> 25:14.013
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW YOU
HANDLED THEIR TEENAGE GIRLS.

25:14.046 --> 25:17.016
HOW I HANDLED THEM?

25:17.049 --> 25:18.985
THE PARENTS ARE THE ONES
WHO WANT THEIR LITTLE GIRLS

25:19.018 --> 25:20.587
TO LOOK LIKE
HOOCHIE MAMAS.

25:20.620 --> 25:23.623
I'M THE ONE TELLING THEM
TO KEEP THEIR CLOTHES ON.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.758
I'M PROTECTING
THOSE GIRLS.

25:25.792 --> 25:27.193
IS THAT WHY YOU BOUGHT
THE PEPPER SPRAY?

25:27.226 --> 25:30.129
THAT...
THAT'S SO HILARIOUS.

25:30.162 --> 25:32.331
SO HILARIOUS THAT YOU GUYS KNOW
I BOUGHT PEPPER SPRAY,

25:32.364 --> 25:33.966
'CAUSE YOU'RE THE POLICE,
RIGHT?

25:34.000 --> 25:37.203
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THE FIRST DAY
MISSY WAS IN L.A.,

25:37.236 --> 25:38.237
SHE GOT MUGGED.

25:38.270 --> 25:39.238
REALLY?

25:39.271 --> 25:41.107
BETH AND BOB DRIVE

25:41.140 --> 25:42.775
STRAIGHT TO VENICE BEACH,
AND WHEN THEY GET THERE,

25:42.809 --> 25:44.310
WHILE MISSY IS WALKING
ON THE BOARDWALK,

25:44.343 --> 25:45.978
SOME SKATER
YANKS HER PURSE.

25:46.012 --> 25:48.715
SO I BUY HER A NEW BAG,
PUT PEPPER SPRAY IN IT

25:48.748 --> 25:51.350
TO KEEP HER PARENTS
FROM RUNNING BACK TO INDIANA.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.753
IT'S CALLED PRODUCING,

25:53.786 --> 25:55.354
WHICH IS MY JOB.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.189
NOW I'LL LEAVE YOU
TO DO YOURS.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.325
OH. THAT IS THE BEST IDEA
YOU'VE HAD ALL DAY.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.160
LIEUTENANT,
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.

26:01.193 --> 26:02.762
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING

26:02.795 --> 26:05.798
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR
THE MURDER OF BOB MICHAELS.

26:05.832 --> 26:08.100
MURDER

26:08.134 --> 26:09.268
HE WASN'T MURDERED.
HE FELL.

26:09.301 --> 26:10.369
LOOK IT UP
IN THE DICTIONARY, LADY.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.371
HE FELL!

26:12.404 --> 26:14.040
IT WAS HARD SOMETIMES,

26:14.073 --> 26:17.710
DADDY TELLING ME ONE THING
AND THEN BRUNO SAYING ANOTHER

26:17.744 --> 26:19.846
AND MY MOM
SAYING SOMETHING ELSE.

26:19.879 --> 26:21.914
I'M SO SORRY, DETECTIVE,

26:21.948 --> 26:25.384
BUT I NEED TO LOOK INSIDE
MISSY'S PURSE.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.619
OKAY.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.791
LET'S SEE HERE.

26:31.824 --> 26:34.861
WAIT A MINUTE!
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

26:34.894 --> 26:38.330
I'M LOOKING FOR THE PEPPER SPRAY
THAT BRUNO BOUGHT FOR YOU.

26:38.364 --> 26:41.000
I'M NOT FINDING IT.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.302
MAYBE I LOST IT.

26:43.335 --> 26:45.204
WELL, UNDER
THE CIRCUMSTANCES, MISSY...

26:45.237 --> 26:47.674
THAT IS NOT A GOOD ANSWER.

26:53.445 --> 26:56.182
Lopez:
THE ARREST OF BRUNO PEREZ,

26:56.215 --> 26:57.850
MANAGER OF INTERNET SENSATION
MISSY MICHAELS,

26:57.884 --> 27:00.853
MAKES HER FATHER'S DEATH
SEEM EVEN STRANGER.

27:00.887 --> 27:02.689
WAS HIS FALL OFF A CLIFF

27:02.722 --> 27:05.024
A PUBLICITY STUNT
GONE TERRIBLY WRONG?

27:05.057 --> 27:06.258
YES?
YEAH.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.760
HOW COME THIS, UH,
BRUNO CHARACTER

27:07.794 --> 27:09.662
ANNOUNCED HIS ARREST
TO THE PRESS?

27:09.696 --> 27:11.297
WE GIVE PEOPLE
THEIR PHONE CALLS.

27:11.330 --> 27:12.999
WHO THEY CALL
IS UP TO THEM.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.101
MAYBE HE THOUGHT
THAT IF HE ACTED RASHLY,

27:15.134 --> 27:17.169
HIS PROBLEMS
WOULD MAGICALLY DISAPPEAR.

27:17.203 --> 27:20.172
LIKE SOMEONE WHO SIGNS
A SETTLEMENT TO A LAWSUIT

27:20.206 --> 27:22.308
WITHOUT TALKING
TO HER ATTORNEY.

27:22.341 --> 27:24.777
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT THAT?

27:24.811 --> 27:27.179
WELL, I HAVE TO FORWARD ALL
SIGNED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS

27:27.213 --> 27:28.347
TO PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS.

27:28.380 --> 27:29.816
SORRY.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.083
CHIEF, IT IS MY JOB

27:31.117 --> 27:33.285
TO REVIEW
ALL LEGAL AGREEMENTS

27:33.319 --> 27:34.954
CONCERNING
OFFICER CONDUCT,

27:34.987 --> 27:37.690
AND I REFUSE TO CERTIFY
THIS DOCUMENT.

27:37.724 --> 27:38.958
WHY?

27:38.991 --> 27:40.326
BECAUSE WE NEED TO DETERMINE

27:40.359 --> 27:42.328
IF THE TERM
"PROFESSIONALLY INDIFFERENT"

27:42.361 --> 27:44.063
HAS BROADER
LEGAL IMPLICATIONS.

27:44.096 --> 27:45.164
HONESTLY.

27:45.197 --> 27:46.232
YOU THINK
I'D BE CONGRATULATED

27:46.265 --> 27:47.399
FOR AGREEING TO FALL
ON MY SWORD.

27:47.433 --> 27:48.968
Pope: RIGHT?

27:49.001 --> 27:50.803
AND WITH NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE
OFF THE TABLE,

27:50.837 --> 27:52.839
IT'S REALLY MORE LIKE
A PENKNIFE, ANYWAY.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.275
UH...

27:56.308 --> 27:58.044
I WANT TO SIGN IT.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.312
MAYBE TONIGHT.
WE'LL SEE.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.882
FINE.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.917
I tried.

28:09.355 --> 28:12.358
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THIS DEAL
ISN'T GETTING ANY BETTER.

28:12.391 --> 28:14.927
THERE'S SOMETHING HERE
WE'RE MISSING.

28:14.961 --> 28:16.262
I DON'T TRUST GOLDMAN.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.731
AND WHEN IT COMES
TO THIS AGREEMENT,

28:18.765 --> 28:21.433
I DON'T TRUST YOU,
EITHER.

28:26.105 --> 28:27.907
NOW, DID BRUNO
EVER INSTRUCT YOU

28:27.940 --> 28:29.508
ON HOW TO USE
THE PEPPER SPRAY?

28:29.541 --> 28:31.911
NO. HE JUST TOLD ME
TO KEEP IT IN MY PURSE.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.946
OKAY.
I WANT YOU TO TRY TO THINK

28:33.980 --> 28:37.049
OF ALL THE TIMES YOU DIDN'T HAVE
YOUR PURSE WITH YOU

28:37.083 --> 28:38.517
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HERE
IN LOS ANGELES.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.752
WHY?

28:39.786 --> 28:40.987
BECAUSE, MISSY,

28:41.020 --> 28:42.889
THAT PEPPER SPRAY
BRUNO BOUGHT YOU

28:42.922 --> 28:44.824
ENDED UP ALL OVER
YOUR FATHER'S FACE.

28:49.428 --> 28:51.197
OH, MY GOSH.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.001
BRUNO HAD...

28:55.034 --> 28:56.535
HAD MY PURSE
LOCKED IN HIS OFFICE

28:56.568 --> 28:58.537
THE WHOLE TIME
THAT WE WORKED ON THE VIDEO.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.807
OKAY. NOW,
WHEN YOU GOT IT BACK,

29:00.840 --> 29:02.374
DID YOU NOTICE
IF ANYTHING WAS MISSING?

29:02.408 --> 29:03.910
NO, I MEAN...

29:03.943 --> 29:06.879
I WAS HAVING
TOO MUCH FUN SINGING.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.482
WHAT ABOUT YOUR DADDY?
WAS HE HAVING FUN?

29:10.516 --> 29:13.485
YEAH.
HE LOVED IT.

29:13.519 --> 29:16.488
BUT AFTERWARDS...

29:16.522 --> 29:18.224
I DON'T KNOW --
SOMETHING CHANGED.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.492
CHANGED?
IN WHAT WAY?

29:20.526 --> 29:22.261
LIKE, OUT OF THE BLUE,

29:22.294 --> 29:27.233
HE JUST SKIPPED MY LAST AUDITION
TO GO ON THAT HIKE.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.802
AND HE NEVER SKIPPED
MY AUDITIONS.

29:29.836 --> 29:32.171
NEVER.

29:32.204 --> 29:33.873
WAIT. WAIT.

29:33.906 --> 29:36.042
IF YOUR FATHER TOOK THE MINIVAN
TO GO ON HIS HIKE,

29:36.075 --> 29:37.810
HOW DID YOU GET
TO YOUR AUDITION?

29:37.844 --> 29:39.445
WELL, MY MOM TOOK ME
IN THE RENTAL CAR,

29:39.478 --> 29:43.950
AND THEN BRUNO PICKED ME UP
AND BROUGHT ME HOME.

29:43.983 --> 29:47.086
YOU HAD TWO VEHICLES
THAT DAY?

29:50.289 --> 29:53.025
THE MICHAELS RESERVED
THEIR RENTAL CAR

29:53.059 --> 29:55.527
ONE WEEK BEFORE BOB
WENT ON HIS HIKE.

29:55.561 --> 29:57.964
AND WE ASKED THE FAMILY'S
CREDIT-CARD COMPANIES

29:57.997 --> 29:59.899
TO ALERT US OF
ANY UNUSUAL ACTIVITIES.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.034
GUESS WHAT WE FOUND
ON ONE OF THE DAYS

30:02.068 --> 30:04.303
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE LOST
IN THE MOUNTAINS.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.906
HOW ABOUT A HOTEL CHARGE
OF $8.83

30:06.939 --> 30:09.175
FOR A BOX
OF BLUE GUMMY BEARS?

30:09.208 --> 30:10.176
Provenza: GOOD LORD.

30:10.209 --> 30:11.978
$8 FOR GUMMY BEARS?

30:12.011 --> 30:14.480
Gabriel: SEE, THEY MUST HAVE
PAID FOR THE ROOM IN CASH,

30:14.513 --> 30:16.215
WHICH IS WHY WE DIDN'T
CATCH IT EARLIER,

30:16.248 --> 30:17.416
BUT THEY HAD TO LEAVE
A CREDIT CARD FOR INCIDENTALS.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.351
MINIBARS --
GET YOU EVERY TIME.

30:19.385 --> 30:22.354
WIFE FOLLOWS HUSBAND UP
THE MOUNTAIN IN A RENTAL,

30:22.388 --> 30:24.023
THEY ABANDON THEIR MINIVAN,

30:24.056 --> 30:26.592
SHE DRIVES HIM BACK TO THE HOTEL
IN THE RENTAL CAR

30:26.625 --> 30:28.394
FOR A FIVE-DAY
MEDIA BLOWOUT.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.262
STARRING BOB, BETH,
AND MISSY.

30:30.296 --> 30:32.264
OKAY. WHERE'S THAT RENTAL CAR?
IS IT HERE?

30:32.298 --> 30:34.100
WE SHOULD CHECK IT
FOR PEPPER SPRAY.

30:34.133 --> 30:36.302
I'LL CHECK IT, CHIEF.
THANK YOU.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.436
I HEAR SOMEONE HAS DECIDED

30:37.469 --> 30:39.038
THEY CAN ACT
AS THEIR OWN LAWYER.

30:39.071 --> 30:40.639
OH, NO.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.574
I-I-I'M JUST ABOUT
TO INTERVIEW A SUSPECT,

30:42.608 --> 30:45.177
AND WE DON'T HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT TODAY.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.213
UH, DETECTIVE GABRIEL,
WOULD YOU COME WITH ME, PLEASE,

30:47.246 --> 30:48.948
AND BRING THAT
CREDIT

30:48.981 --> 30:51.951
BUZZ, I WANT YOU, YOUR CAMERA,
AND YOUR BEST TRIPOD.

30:51.984 --> 30:53.953
OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

30:53.986 --> 30:54.987
YOU'RE STILL WORKING
ON THAT CASE?

30:55.021 --> 30:56.188
MM-HMM.

30:56.222 --> 30:58.590
* DADDY, SAY YES

30:59.691 --> 31:00.626
YES?

31:00.659 --> 31:02.328
OH, MY GOD.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.964
IS THAT NOT
THE WORST VIDEO EVER?

31:04.997 --> 31:06.365
I'VE WATCHED IT
50 TIMES.

31:06.398 --> 31:08.534
CHIEF, DO YOUR WORK.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.602
WE'LL WAIT FOR YOU
IN YOUR CONFERENCE ROOM.

31:10.636 --> 31:11.904
OH, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.105
IF I'M OFF THE CLOCK,

31:13.139 --> 31:14.640
I WOULD REALLY LIKE
TO SEE THESE PEOPLE.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.175
CAN I WATCH
YOUR INTERVIEW?

31:16.208 --> 31:18.310
AS LONG AS
YOU'RE NOT CHARGING ME.

31:18.344 --> 31:19.645
OKAY.

31:19.678 --> 31:21.213
OKAY.

31:21.247 --> 31:22.214
OKAY.

31:22.248 --> 31:23.916
Buzz: CHIEF?

31:23.950 --> 31:25.317
WHERE SHOULD I
SET THIS UP?

31:27.119 --> 31:29.488
I DON'T RECOGNIZE
THESE CHARGES.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.924
WE NEVER PAID
FOR A HOTEL ANYWHERE.

31:31.958 --> 31:34.994
SOMEBODY MUST HAVE STOLEN
OUR CREDIT-CARD NUMBER.

31:35.027 --> 31:37.163
WELL, I'M SURE THE DNA TESTS
FROM THE HOTEL ROOM

31:37.196 --> 31:39.298
WILL TELL US IF EITHER OF YOU
WERE EVER THERE.

31:43.435 --> 31:45.337
I MEAN,
BOB COULD HAVE BEEN THERE.

31:45.371 --> 31:46.372
I DON'T KNOW.

31:46.405 --> 31:49.075
GOOD GOD IN HEAVEN, BETH.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.178
OKAY, MISS MICHAELS.

31:52.211 --> 31:53.712
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING
YOU DO KNOW,

31:53.745 --> 31:56.482
LIKE WHY YOU RENTED A CAR

31:56.515 --> 31:57.683
A WEEK BEFORE
YOUR DAUGHTER'S AUDITION

31:57.716 --> 31:58.951
WHEN YOU WERE
RUNNING OUT OF MONEY.

32:02.321 --> 32:05.624
OKAY. OKAY.
I CAN EXPLAIN THAT.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.226
I MEAN, UM...

32:07.259 --> 32:08.995
BOB DECIDED
THAT HE HAD TO GO BACK

32:09.028 --> 32:10.396
TO HIS OLD JOB
IN FORT WAYNE.

32:10.429 --> 32:11.563
NO, BETH.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.365
THAT IS WHY HE WENT
ON THAT HIKE,

32:13.399 --> 32:17.003
TO THINK ABOUT HOW HE COULD
BREAK THE NEWS TO MISSY.

32:17.036 --> 32:20.172
THE RENTAL CAR WAS FOR US
AFTER HE LEFT.

32:20.206 --> 32:22.241
MR. DURANT,

32:22.274 --> 32:24.410
YOU TOLD ME
THAT YOUR DAUGHTER

32:24.443 --> 32:26.312
WAS AN AMATEUR PERFORMER,

32:26.345 --> 32:30.049
BUT SHE SEEMS LIKE
A PROFESSIONAL TO ME.

32:30.082 --> 32:33.352
WHEN SHE JUST SAID THAT BOB
WAS GOING BACK TO HIS OLD JOB,

32:33.385 --> 32:35.354
THAT WAS SO BELIEVABLE.

32:35.387 --> 32:36.588
WHAT?

32:36.622 --> 32:38.424
BECAUSE BOB HAD NO JOB
TO GO BACK TO.

32:39.658 --> 32:41.127
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
MR. DURANT?

32:42.394 --> 32:43.429
DADDY.

32:45.564 --> 32:49.501
AND MISSY TOLD US THAT YOU
DROPPED HER AT HER AUDITION

32:49.535 --> 32:51.537
BUT THAT BRUNO TOOK HER HOME.

32:51.570 --> 32:55.307
WHATEVER THIS MESS IS,

32:55.341 --> 32:56.775
KEEP MISSY OUT OF IT.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.311
WELL, I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU'D WANT TO DO THAT, SIR,

32:59.345 --> 33:01.147
BECAUSE YOUR SON-IN-LAW'S
DISAPPEARANCE

33:01.180 --> 33:02.448
WAS A GIANT
PUBLICITY STUNT.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.183
OH, NO, NO, NO.
THERE WAS NO HOAX.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.085
ACTUALLY, THERE WAS.

33:06.118 --> 33:07.386
AND IT LOOKS TO ME
LIKE MISSY WAS INVOLVED.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.055
IF SHE WASN'T,

33:09.088 --> 33:12.091
YOU NEED TO CLEAR THAT UP
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

33:13.792 --> 33:16.162
HOW?

33:16.195 --> 33:19.131
HOW WOULD I DO THAT?

33:19.165 --> 33:21.167
MRS. MICHAELS,

33:21.200 --> 33:25.404
THIS IS THE L.A.P.D.'s RESIDENT
MEDIA DIRECTOR, BUZZ WATSON.

33:25.437 --> 33:26.805
HOW DO YOU DO?

33:26.838 --> 33:29.508
HAVE A SEAT.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.510
BUZZ IS OUR LIAISON
TO ALL THE MAJOR STUDIOS

33:31.543 --> 33:33.445
AND TELEVISION STATIONS
HERE IN HOLLYWOOD.

33:33.479 --> 33:34.746
HE'S GONNA FILM
YOUR STATEMENT

33:34.780 --> 33:36.282
AND MAKE SURE
THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

33:36.315 --> 33:37.449
GET TO SEE YOU TAKE
FULL RESPONSIBILITY

33:37.483 --> 33:39.085
FOR THE PUBLICITY STUNT,

33:39.118 --> 33:40.752
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
GET MISSY OFF THE HOOK.

33:40.786 --> 33:43.355
IF YOU GIVE US PERMISSION,

33:43.389 --> 33:44.690
I COULD EVEN POST
YOUR STATEMENT

33:44.723 --> 33:46.458
ON THE L.A.P.D.'s WEBSITE

33:46.492 --> 33:48.360
AND ADD A LINK THAT LETS
PEOPLE CLICK STRAIGHT THROUGH

33:48.394 --> 33:49.828
TO YOUR DAUGHTER'S VIDEO.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.730
ALL YOU NEED TO DO
IS SIGN THIS RELEASE FORM,

33:51.763 --> 33:53.499
SOMETHING
THAT BUZZ REQUIRES.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.401
AND IF YOU'RE OKAY
WITH ALL THAT,

33:55.434 --> 33:57.536
THE NEWS WILL RUN
YOUR STORY FOR WEEKS.

33:57.569 --> 34:00.772
YOU CAN GENERATE
THAT KIND OF PRESS?

34:00.806 --> 34:03.709
WHY DO YOU THINK
THEY CALL ME "BUZZ"?

34:06.612 --> 34:08.314
ARE WE LIT?

34:09.715 --> 34:12.851
WE'RE READY --
BROADCAST-QUALITY.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.853
Great.

34:18.557 --> 34:20.492
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

34:20.526 --> 34:22.228
JUST TELL YOUR
STORY TRUTHFULLY.

34:22.261 --> 34:24.096
WE'LL BE ASKING YOU QUESTIONS
OFF CAMERA.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.597
I JUST WANT THIS
TO BE AS MUCH

34:25.631 --> 34:27.533
ABOUT YOU AS POSSIBLE.

34:27.566 --> 34:29.768
OKAY, EVERYBODY,
WE'RE ROLLING.

34:29.801 --> 34:31.637
AND...ACTION.

34:31.670 --> 34:35.141
UM

34:35.174 --> 34:39.178
FIRST, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE

34:39.211 --> 34:41.847
TO EVERYONE WHO WORKED
SO HARD TO FIND BOB.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.482
WE WERE JUST PARENTS

34:43.515 --> 34:45.284
TRYING TO CREATE A BREAK
FOR OUR DAUGHTER.

34:45.317 --> 34:47.653
WE KNEW IF PEOPLE COULD HEAR
HER SING JUST ONCE,

34:47.686 --> 34:49.621
SHE'D BE ON HER WAY.

34:49.655 --> 34:55.227
AND SO WE CAME UP WITH A PLAN
TO GET EVERYONE'S ATTENTION.

34:55.261 --> 34:58.364
WITHOUT MISSY'S KNOWLEDGE,

34:58.397 --> 35:00.899
BOB WOULD PRETEND TO BE LOST
IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS

35:00.932 --> 35:03.669
WHILE HE WAS ACTUALLY
HIDING OUT IN A HOTEL.

35:03.702 --> 35:06.272
WHEN IT WAS TIME
FOR HIM TO BE RESCUED,

35:06.305 --> 35:08.540
I'D PICK HIM UP AND DROP HIM OFF
AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE PARK.

35:08.574 --> 35:13.279
THIS WAS A TERRIBLE TRICK
TO PLAY ON ALL OF YOU.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.716
SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW
YOU INTENDED BOB TO BE FOUND.

35:17.749 --> 35:20.852
OH. OH. UH...

35:20.886 --> 35:22.454
OKAY, WAIT. WAIT.
ONE SECOND.

35:22.488 --> 35:24.256
UH, Y-YOU CAN CUT
AROUND THIS, RIGHT?

35:24.290 --> 35:26.292
WE CAN.

35:26.325 --> 35:27.826
Okay.

35:30.662 --> 35:33.465
UM, WHEN THE MOMENT CAME,
I FOLLOWED OUR PLAN.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.501
I WENT TO PICK HIM UP
IN BURBANK,

35:35.534 --> 35:36.902
WHERE HE'D BEEN ALL WEEK,

35:36.935 --> 35:38.870
BUT BOB PANICKED.

35:38.904 --> 35:43.675
HE...SHOWERED TO LOOK
"BETTER ON CAMERA,"

35:43.709 --> 35:45.811
WHICH WAS COMPLETELY
OUT OF CHARACTER

35:45.844 --> 35:48.280
FOR SOMEONE WHO WAS SUPPOSED
TO HAVE BEEN

35:48.314 --> 35:50.316
WANDERING AROUND LOST
FOR SO LONG.

35:50.349 --> 35:52.951
AND THEN, WHEN I FINALLY GOT HIM
UP THE MOUNTAIN,

35:52.984 --> 35:56.188
THE REAL PROBLEM CAME OUT.

35:56.222 --> 35:58.690
BOB WAS TERRIFIED PEOPLE
WOULDN'T BELIEVE OUR STORY.

35:58.724 --> 36:01.627
Gabriel: OKAY, UM,
WAIT A MINUTE, MRS. MICHAELS,

36:01.660 --> 36:03.729
'CAUSE WE NEED YOU TO BE
COMPLETELY TRUTHFUL,

36:03.762 --> 36:06.532
AND WE DIDN'T FIND
ANY EVIDENCE

36:06.565 --> 36:08.700
OF BOB BEING UP ON
THAT MOUNTAIN WITH ANYONE.

36:14.273 --> 36:16.408
WELL, I, UH...

36:16.442 --> 36:20.812
I SORT OF COVERED UP
MY FOOTPRINTS

36:20.846 --> 36:22.514
ON THE WAY BACK DOWN
THE HILL BECAUSE...

36:22.548 --> 36:23.915
IT NEEDED TO LOOK LIKE

36:23.949 --> 36:25.451
BOB HAD BEEN UP THERE ALONE.

36:25.484 --> 36:28.454
BUT THE TRUTH IS, HE REFUSED,

36:28.487 --> 36:32.958
OUTRIGHT REFUSED TO WALK UP
THAT TRAIL BY HIMSELF.

36:32.991 --> 36:34.560
AND WATCHING
ALL THE NEWS COVERAGE

36:34.593 --> 36:36.362
ABOUT WHAT COULD GO WRONG
IN THE MOUNTAINS AT NIGHT

36:36.395 --> 36:37.429
SCARED THE HELL OUT OF HIM.

36:37.463 --> 36:41.300
AND THEN HE WENT WILD...

36:41.333 --> 36:43.302
BLAMING ME.

36:44.670 --> 36:47.806
AND THEN HE PUSHED ME.

36:47.839 --> 36:52.611
IN SELF-DEFENSE,
I PUSHED HIM BACK,

36:52.644 --> 36:55.814
AND HE FELL OFF THE TRAIL,

36:55.847 --> 36:58.550
PLUMMETING TO HIS DEATH.

37:02.621 --> 37:04.990
BEAUTIFUL.
AND CUT.

37:06.858 --> 37:09.728
MRS. MICHAELS,
THAT WAS GREAT.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.897
THANK YOU.

37:13.532 --> 37:15.634
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO ONE MORE TAKE,

37:15.667 --> 37:17.303
JUST FOR SAFETY?

37:17.336 --> 37:19.037
CAN'T GET BETTER
THAN THAT.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.739
SORRY -- IT'S JUST
THAT I-I LEFT OUT SO MUCH,

37:20.772 --> 37:22.408
LIKE ABOUT BOB BREAKING DOWN
AND EATING PIZZA

37:22.441 --> 37:23.542
JUST BEFORE I PICKED HIM UP.

37:23.575 --> 37:24.976
Brenda:
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

37:25.010 --> 37:26.778
YOU ALSO LEFT OUT THE PART
ABOUT THE PEPPER SPRAY.

37:26.812 --> 37:28.514
EXCUSE ME?

37:28.547 --> 37:30.816
YOU STOLE PEPPER SPRAY
FROM YOUR DAUGHTER'S PURSE

37:30.849 --> 37:32.418
AND BROUGHT IT ALONG
WITH YOU

37:32.451 --> 37:34.286
WHEN YOU TOOK BOB BACK UP
TO THAT MOUNTAIN.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.288
WHAT --
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

37:36.322 --> 37:37.523
WELL, PEPPER SPRAY

37:37.556 --> 37:39.591
IS AN ENORMOUSLY VOLATILE
AIRBORNE WEAPON.

37:39.625 --> 37:42.861
WHEN YOU TOOK BOB UP
TO THE EDGE OF THAT CLIFF,

37:42.894 --> 37:45.063
WIND WAS GUSTING
UP TO 30 MILES AN HOUR.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.398

AND YOUR SHOES --

37:50.035 --> 37:51.403
WE'LL FIND IT THERE, TOO.

37:51.437 --> 37:52.471
IS THAT TRUE?

37:52.504 --> 37:54.406
D

37:54.440 --> 37:55.541
OF COURSE IT'S NOT TRUE.

37:55.574 --> 37:57.376
Beth: SO I...

37:57.409 --> 37:58.844
I BROUGHT PEPPER SPRAY
WITH ME.

37:58.877 --> 38:00.379
I DON'T SEE
HOW THAT MATTERS.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.047
WELL, IT INDICATES THAT
YOU THOUGHT YOUR HUSBAND

38:02.080 --> 38:03.582
WOULD BE A HANDFUL

38:03.615 --> 38:04.983
EVEN BEFORE YOU WENT TO
PICK HIM UP THAT NIGHT.

38:05.016 --> 38:07.052
Gabriel: KIND OF UNDERCUTS
THE WHOLE IDEA

38:07.085 --> 38:09.020
THAT YOU WENT UP ON THE MOUNTAIN
WITH BOB

38:09.054 --> 38:10.622
AND HAD
A SPONTANEOUS ARGUMENT.

38:10.656 --> 38:13.992
ALL RIGHT, WELL,

38:14.025 --> 38:16.328
SO I HAD A FEELING HE MIGHT
CHICKEN OUT, AND HE DID.

38:16.362 --> 38:17.929
LOOK --
I ACTUALLY MADE HIM SOUND

38:17.963 --> 38:19.631
A LOT BETTER
THAN HE WAS,

38:19.665 --> 38:24.403
AND  I MEAN,
YOU HAVE NO IDEA -- NONE --

38:24.436 --> 38:26.805
HOW JEALOUS HE WAS THAT MISSY
AND ME WERE ON TELEVISION

38:26.838 --> 38:28.774
AND HE WASN'T.

38:30.108 --> 38:32.911
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

38:32.944 --> 38:34.980
HOW SOON WILL THIS VIDEO GET OUT
TO THE NATIONAL MEDIA?

38:35.013 --> 38:36.948
UH...

38:36.982 --> 38:40.986
I'D SAY...
A YEAR AND A HALF-ISH.

38:41.019 --> 38:43.455
A YEAR AND A HALF?

38:43.489 --> 38:45.891
BUT YOU SAID
PEOPLE WOULD SEE ME.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.726
OH, PEOPLE WILL.

38:47.759 --> 38:49.595
12 JURORS, 2 ALTERNATES,
AND A JUDGE

38:49.628 --> 38:51.763
WILL HEAR YOU SAY
ON CAMERA

38:51.797 --> 38:53.399
THAT YOU BROUGHT
PEPPER SPRAY

38:53.432 --> 38:54.700
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT YOUR
HUSBAND WAS GONNA CHICKEN OUT.

38:54.733 --> 38:56.402
NO, BUT HE SAID "CUT."

38:56.435 --> 38:57.536
IT'S STILL ROLLING.

I-I SIGNED AN AGREEMENT.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.713
OH! OH.

WANTED TO HEAR -- SO SIMPLE.

39:36.174 --> 39:39.878
WELL, WHEN SOMEONE IS GUILTY,
THEY'RE PRETTY EASY TO LEAD.

39:39.911 --> 39:41.413
HOW RIGHT YOU ARE.

39:41.447 --> 39:43.782
THAT'S WHY...

39:46.752 --> 39:49.688
NO -- HEY. COME ON.
WE NEED TO DISCUSS THIS.

39:49.721 --> 39:50.922
NO, WE DON'T.

39:50.956 --> 39:53.124

OF TERRELL BAYLOR.

39:58.196 --> 40:01.099

THE WRONGFUL-DEATH CHARGES.

NOT TO RE-FILE

OH, MY GOD.

40:09.841 --> 40:11.209
DO YOU REALLY THINK HE'D STILL
TRY TO TAKE ME TO COURT?

40:11.242 --> 40:12.844
WELL, THIS IS WHY
HE WANTED US

40:12.878 --> 40:14.880
TO CHECK OUT THE OFFER
WITH A MICROSCOPE.

40:14.913 --> 40:18.016
HE WANTED US TO CONCENTRATE
ON WHAT WAS IN THE SETTLEMENT,

40:18.049 --> 40:19.585
NOT ON WHAT WASN'T.
