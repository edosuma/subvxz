01:15.701 --> 01:17.900
Is it really
gonna happen today, Daddy?

01:17.934 --> 01:20.533
Are we really gonna eat?

01:21.501 --> 01:23.033
That we are, kids.

01:23.067 --> 01:24.800
And this time
it's no pipe dream.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.600
I gave your mother
some money,

01:26.634 --> 01:28.400
towed her car
to the supermarket,

01:28.434 --> 01:31.667
tied her hands--
Tied her hands to the cart,

01:31.701 --> 01:32.934
put my foot on her rear,

01:32.968 --> 01:36.767
and jump-started her
towards the meat department.

01:36.801 --> 01:38.934
So get ready, kids,
'cause soon our mouths

01:38.968 --> 01:42.266
will be alive with dead animals
from every race and religion.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.333
Good.
Mm.

01:44.367 --> 01:46.700
You make it sound
so good, Dad.

01:46.734 --> 01:48.166
Tell us again
what supper was like

01:48.200 --> 01:49.567
when you were a boy.
Yeah.

01:49.601 --> 01:51.333
Well...

01:51.367 --> 01:53.233
You young'uns never get tired
of hearing it.

01:53.267 --> 01:54.233
No, no.
No.

01:54.267 --> 01:55.300
All right.

01:55.334 --> 01:57.633
Well, back in the old days,

01:57.667 --> 01:59.633
whenever the sun would go down,

01:59.667 --> 02:01.733
we'd all gather at a table,
much like this one.

02:01.767 --> 02:03.200
Wow.

02:03.234 --> 02:06.366
Matter of fact,
it was this one.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.966
And there before us,

02:08.000 --> 02:10.366
stretched as far
as the eye could see,

02:10.400 --> 02:12.667
was meat.
Mm.

02:12.701 --> 02:15.433
Oh, do I remember the meat.

02:15.467 --> 02:16.834
I was only 5 years old,

02:16.868 --> 02:18.567
but I remember
my dad telling me,

02:18.601 --> 02:21.999
"Save your table scraps
for Mommy."

02:22.033 --> 02:24.633
Of course we never did.

02:24.667 --> 02:28.933
Oh, look, Dad,
your little boy's eating again.

02:30.267 --> 02:32.166
Daddy, who made you
this meat?

02:32.200 --> 02:34.633
Well, back then,
we called her mother.

02:35.667 --> 02:37.834
See, kids, "mother" meant
"home cooking" then.

02:37.868 --> 02:39.733
'Course back then,
"gay" meant "happy."

02:39.767 --> 02:42.134
Well...

02:43.467 --> 02:45.200
Dad, were there
any vegetables?

02:45.234 --> 02:48.066
Yeah, but we pushed them
off to the side.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.066
Save room for the biscuits
and the butter.

02:50.100 --> 02:53.867
And not that hard butter either
that cruelly rips the bread.

02:53.901 --> 02:56.966
But soft butter
that spreads smooth

02:57.000 --> 03:00.167
like your grandma's butt
on a barstool.

03:01.968 --> 03:03.566
Mm, mm, mm.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.700
Ooh.

03:38.501 --> 03:41.167
Where's our meat,
woman?

03:42.501 --> 03:45.233
Al, did you get these kids
into a frenzy again

03:45.267 --> 03:47.400
over this eating thing?

03:47.434 --> 03:49.033
You know,
you just won't be happy

03:49.067 --> 03:52.367
till I'm as afraid to come home
as you are, will ya?

03:54.367 --> 03:57.666
Well, this is a fine
how-do-you-doody.

03:59.534 --> 04:01.900
You with your fairy stories
about meat,

04:01.934 --> 04:04.066
and you,
who goes to the market

04:04.100 --> 04:05.567
and brings home what?

04:05.601 --> 04:06.966
Something with letters

04:07.000 --> 04:09.933
that aren't even
in alphabetical order.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.834
Which, I suspect,
are of use

04:12.868 --> 04:16.233
for only those
who can read.

04:16.267 --> 04:18.366
Now, we were promised food.
And what do we get?

04:18.399 --> 04:20.200
Just another meatless Monday.

04:20.233 --> 04:23.267
This is no fun day.

04:24.367 --> 04:25.867
It-- It's the meat D.T.'s.

04:25.901 --> 04:26.900
Bud,

04:26.934 --> 04:28.433
take your sister
for a walk.

04:28.467 --> 04:29.767
And don't tie her
to a hydrant

04:29.801 --> 04:32.233
and go for a soda
like last time.

04:32.267 --> 04:35.800
Just 'cause she can't think
doesn't mean she can't feel.

04:35.834 --> 04:39.600
Honey, it'd be good for you
to be seen with a pretty girl.

04:39.634 --> 04:40.966
Yeah, right.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.833
They'll just think I paid
for her like everybody else.

04:50.701 --> 04:53.166
Look.
Buck has a bone.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.600
Oh, God,
it's got meat on it!

04:58.400 --> 04:59.467
Pookie.

04:59.501 --> 05:00.934
Yes, honey?

05:00.968 --> 05:03.533
Take all your clothes off
right now.

05:03.567 --> 05:05.333
Oh, baby.

05:05.367 --> 05:07.366
You finally
wanna do it.

05:07.400 --> 05:11.267
No, but I need something
to kill my appetite.

05:12.267 --> 05:15.867
Peg, what did you spend
the $20 on I gave you for food?

05:15.901 --> 05:18.900
Well, I ate,
of course.

05:18.934 --> 05:22.266
<i>And then I bought
this magazine, Amazing Homes.</i>

05:22.300 --> 05:24.133
Just look
at this house, Al.

05:24.167 --> 05:25.366
Why can't we have a house

05:25.400 --> 05:28.966
with a name
like Chateau Paradise?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.200
Well,

05:30.234 --> 05:32.266
maybe I'm mismanaging
my $3.20 an hour.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.767
Let's see.

05:36.067 --> 05:38.400
Well, I'm sure
that the shoe salesman

05:38.434 --> 05:40.266
that owns
this house is, uh--

05:40.300 --> 05:41.266
Well, wait a minute.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.533
No, it's not
a shoe salesman.

05:43.567 --> 05:47.033
That's Bob "I'm a zillionaire"
Hope's house.

05:47.067 --> 05:49.533
Oh, wait. Maybe this really
big house is a shoe salesman's.

05:49.567 --> 05:52.933
No, dagnabit.
This is a drug lord.

05:54.300 --> 05:57.867
Gee, I-- I feel so worthless.
You deserve so much more.

05:57.901 --> 06:00.266
I mean, your rear end
should be squashing a couch

06:00.300 --> 06:02.300
much bigger than ours.

06:02.334 --> 06:03.400
Oh, honey.

06:03.434 --> 06:05.934
You can be so sweet
when you want to be.

06:05.968 --> 06:07.333
But don't feel bad.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.966
I never expected you
to amount to anything.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.733
You know, the guy
I fell in love with

06:11.767 --> 06:13.500
was just a crazy,
carefree guy

06:13.534 --> 06:16.700
with an easy smile
and a fast car.

06:16.734 --> 06:19.767
'Course, he wouldn't marry me,
so I took you.

06:19.801 --> 06:22.166
But I've never looked back.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.166
Ooh.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.533
Except when we kiss.

06:25.567 --> 06:27.400
Well, don't look back
the next time I ask you

06:27.434 --> 06:28.999
to open the garage door
for me either.

06:29.033 --> 06:31.300
'Cause if you do, you might see
the mighty Dodge emblem

06:31.334 --> 06:33.234
bearin' down on ya.

06:35.834 --> 06:38.867
Yeah, like I'd really stand
in front of your car.

06:38.901 --> 06:40.366
I'm telling you,

06:40.400 --> 06:42.834
this magazine says
we can have a lovely home.

06:42.868 --> 06:45.633
And it says that
it doesn't cost very much money.

06:45.667 --> 06:48.200
All it takes
is a decorator's eye,

06:48.234 --> 06:52.300
which I have,
according to Professor Lavar.

06:53.334 --> 06:55.867
Professor Lavar?

06:55.901 --> 06:57.733
How much, Peg?

06:57.767 --> 06:59.333
You're just
gonna love him, Al.

06:59.367 --> 07:00.633
He is the professor

07:00.667 --> 07:02.999
at the Cook County School
of Interior Design,

07:03.033 --> 07:05.366
of which I am now enrolled.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.867
How much, Peg?
Ooh.

07:06.901 --> 07:08.600
I feel so good.

07:08.634 --> 07:11.067
Two thousand dollars.

07:12.501 --> 07:14.366
I have finally found
my calling,

07:14.400 --> 07:17.300
and I knew you'd be happy
for me, honey.

07:17.934 --> 07:19.633
Honey?

07:22.968 --> 07:24.433
Oh, Al, watch out.

07:24.467 --> 07:26.800
Let me get your tongue.

07:32.467 --> 07:34.966
You spent $2000
on a decorating school?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.867
Uh-huh.

07:37.534 --> 07:39.166
Well, it must be my fault.

07:39.200 --> 07:43.433
Sure, I'll take the blame.
I didn't have to say, "I do."

07:43.467 --> 07:44.633
I could've just taken

07:44.667 --> 07:46.633
one of your uncle's
shotgun blasts in the back,

07:46.667 --> 07:48.533
be done with it.

07:48.567 --> 07:52.066
But then, honey, we couldn't
have had that great reception.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.333
You know, where your father
whispered in my ear,

07:54.367 --> 07:56.333
"If you like my son,
I'm twice as fun."

07:56.367 --> 07:58.200
Ah...

07:59.167 --> 08:02.200
Oh, come on, Al. Go with me
on this decorating thing.

08:02.234 --> 08:04.934
I'm really good at it.
You'll see tomorrow.

08:04.968 --> 08:06.200
My homework assignment

08:06.234 --> 08:08.266
is to make one room
in this house

08:08.300 --> 08:09.467
breathtakingly beautiful.

08:09.501 --> 08:10.467
Peg,

08:10.501 --> 08:12.366
this is my house.

08:12.400 --> 08:16.000
If you want it
to look better, dust.

08:18.501 --> 08:21.433
If you want it
to smell better, cook.

08:21.467 --> 08:25.733
If you want it
to be happy, leave.

08:28.534 --> 08:30.999
But do not touch
this house.

08:31.033 --> 08:33.332
I am not a man
happy with change.

08:33.366 --> 08:37.533
Well, that explains your job
and your underwear.

08:39.366 --> 08:40.633
Peg, I'm warning you.

08:40.667 --> 08:42.400
Touch not a hair
in this house.

08:42.433 --> 08:45.600
Do not redecorate.

08:45.634 --> 08:47.433
I won't.

08:47.467 --> 08:49.033
A pox on you.

08:49.067 --> 08:51.566
Like I'd notice.

09:03.067 --> 09:05.200
Seems normal.

09:15.234 --> 09:18.334
Yep. Normal.

09:19.701 --> 09:22.134
Let me check upstairs.

09:25.934 --> 09:28.800
She listened to me!
It's normal!

09:33.801 --> 09:37.467
Son, I'm glad you're here.

09:37.501 --> 09:40.567
I wanna talk to you
about being a man.

09:40.601 --> 09:41.633
See, son, a man--

09:41.667 --> 09:43.500
I know
what you're getting at.

09:43.534 --> 09:47.133
Do you think I want to be
home early on a Friday night?

09:47.167 --> 09:50.200
You think I'm not trying
desperately to get a date?

09:50.234 --> 09:51.999
Do you think I like
hearing the chants:

09:52.033 --> 09:54.099
"Bud, Bud, alone he'll sit.

09:54.133 --> 09:55.500
Bud, Bud, will touch no-- "

09:55.534 --> 09:58.467
I don't wanna talk about you.

10:01.367 --> 10:04.800
I wanna talk about my great
victory over your mother.

10:04.834 --> 10:06.333
Revel with me, son.

10:06.367 --> 10:07.934
She listened to me.
I put my foot down,

10:07.968 --> 10:09.300
and your mother listened
to me.

10:09.334 --> 10:10.366
And you know why?

10:10.400 --> 10:12.867
Because I am the man.

10:12.901 --> 10:16.334
The chief.
The king. The boss.

10:20.334 --> 10:23.333
Bob's Big Boy with fries.

10:23.367 --> 10:26.567
Extra cheese,
maybe a little bacon.

10:26.601 --> 10:28.966
God, I'm hungry.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.266
But anyway, Bud,

10:30.300 --> 10:34.467
always remember
that the man is the boss

10:34.501 --> 10:37.033
because the man--
And it's proven the world over.

10:37.067 --> 10:39.099
Any country you go to,
no matter what it is,

10:39.133 --> 10:42.334
there's always
a word for man.

10:43.234 --> 10:47.334
Dad, are you absolutely sure
you're my real father?

10:47.968 --> 10:49.633
Yes.

10:49.667 --> 10:52.767
Don't you know I called
for an immediate blood test?

10:55.234 --> 10:59.033
Son, now I'm going
to go celebrate my victory

10:59.067 --> 11:02.800
the way a man
celebrates his victory.

11:33.133 --> 11:35.767
How long was I out?

11:35.801 --> 11:38.533
A good 45 minutes.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.200
Why didn't you come get me?

11:40.234 --> 11:43.533
Dad, you're always
in there for 45 minutes.

11:43.567 --> 11:45.900
You did 45 minutes
in the bushes one time.

11:45.934 --> 11:49.834
That was the Jenkins' yard.
That was a good spot.

11:49.868 --> 11:53.067
Well, their roses won prizes
that year.

12:00.434 --> 12:02.400
Oh, hi, honey.
Hi, Bud.

12:02.434 --> 12:03.533
Hey, where's Kelly?

12:03.567 --> 12:04.800
You know,
we haven't seen her

12:04.834 --> 12:06.633
since you took her
for a walk.

12:09.534 --> 12:11.401
So I forgot.

12:12.734 --> 12:14.300
Well, don't worry.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.999
I mean, how much trouble
can she get into

12:16.033 --> 12:17.567
double-knotted
to a telephone pole

12:17.601 --> 12:20.767
in front
of the Pussycat Theater?

12:22.667 --> 12:24.033
Okay, Al.

12:24.067 --> 12:25.800
Now, I know you seen
the bathroom.

12:25.834 --> 12:27.033
What do you think?

12:27.067 --> 12:28.433
Well, Peg,

12:28.467 --> 12:32.000
it's just like your hair
got larger and became a room.

12:33.033 --> 12:34.333
So you like it?

12:34.367 --> 12:37.300
Peg, you took
my once-mighty Ferguson,

12:37.334 --> 12:40.834
and you put a little,
pink fuzzy thing on it.

12:40.868 --> 12:43.934
It cried out to me
in its pain, Peg.

12:43.968 --> 12:46.500
It's a toilet, Al.
It can't talk.

12:46.534 --> 12:49.500
Well, I've known it long enough
to know what it's thinking.

12:49.534 --> 12:52.166
Now, you've desecrated
the toilet I call home.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.934
Oh, Al.

12:53.968 --> 12:55.900
There is plenty of you
left in that bathroom.

12:55.934 --> 12:57.033
Where's my shaving cream?

12:57.067 --> 12:58.966
In the right cup
of the bra rack.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.099
Where's my razor?

13:00.133 --> 13:03.067
In the tampon carousel.

13:05.300 --> 13:06.900
Where's my deodorant?

13:06.934 --> 13:10.633
That is a trick question.
You don't use any.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.099
You promised, Peg.

13:13.133 --> 13:15.567
Well, I promised not to do
a room in this house.

13:15.601 --> 13:17.533
A bathroom is not a room.

13:17.567 --> 13:18.834
Yes, it is a room!

13:18.868 --> 13:22.099
"bath-room."

13:22.133 --> 13:25.134
<i>From the Greek,
bathroqopolis.</i>

13:26.968 --> 13:29.266
A quiet oasis,
away from camels and women.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.567
Now I have to machete my way
through your pantyhose

13:31.601 --> 13:32.900
to use the one upstairs.

13:32.934 --> 13:36.133
Oh. Gee, Al, I don't think
you wanna do that.

13:36.167 --> 13:39.966
You see, I did that one sort of
more like a woman's bathroom.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.133
You know,
it has ballerina faucets

13:42.167 --> 13:43.300
and a bidet.

13:43.334 --> 13:46.566
Oh. And a Mel Gibson
shower nozzle. Heh.

13:47.601 --> 13:50.566
It's shaped just
like his head.

13:51.033 --> 13:53.800
God, I feel so clean.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.433
Gee, I-- I hope
Professor Lavar likes it.

13:56.467 --> 13:58.533
Him and the entire class
are coming over tonight

13:58.567 --> 13:59.934
to grade me
on what I did.

13:59.968 --> 14:03.233
But, Peg, now I have no place
to go to the bathroom.

14:03.267 --> 14:05.733
Oh, stop whining,
you big baby.

14:05.767 --> 14:08.133
Look, why don't you at least
try the new bathroom.

14:08.167 --> 14:10.333
I put a very special
feature on it.

14:10.367 --> 14:11.633
When you flush the toilet,

14:11.667 --> 14:13.933
it plays
"We've Only Just Begun."

14:14.934 --> 14:16.999
Peg, you know that's
our wedding song.

14:17.033 --> 14:20.600
Every time I hear it,
it freezes up my innards solid.

14:20.634 --> 14:23.200
Oh, come on, honey.

14:23.234 --> 14:24.200
Look, just try it.

14:24.234 --> 14:25.633
If you don't like it,

14:25.667 --> 14:27.033
you never have
to do it again.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.300
I've heard that before.

14:28.334 --> 14:31.367
If that was true,
explain Bud to me.
Oh.

15:10.734 --> 15:14.267
No! No! Oh!

15:18.834 --> 15:22.066
Peg? I tried it,
I don't like it.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.099
Change it back.
No.

15:24.133 --> 15:28.366
Peg, a bathroom should be
cold, white, soothing.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.934
It should say,

15:29.968 --> 15:32.867
"Step up to the bowl, pardner,
and make it a double."

15:36.133 --> 15:39.033
But, Peg,
my toilet's not a man.

15:39.067 --> 15:42.633
My Ferguson
has become...Fergie.

15:43.033 --> 15:44.233
Change it back, Peg.

15:44.267 --> 15:45.266
No.

15:45.300 --> 15:47.500
I see we have--
What we have here.

15:47.534 --> 15:49.600
We have a battle of wills.
Well, that's fine.

15:49.634 --> 15:51.600
'Cause I will not bend,
I will not break.

15:51.634 --> 15:54.167
I will not sit,
I will not make.

15:55.400 --> 15:56.767
Was that John Keats?

15:56.801 --> 15:58.334
That was Bundy.

15:58.701 --> 16:00.166
Al Bundy,

16:00.200 --> 16:01.600
man.

16:01.634 --> 16:02.966
And I'm telling you, Peg,

16:03.000 --> 16:04.600
if you don't change
my toilet back,

16:04.634 --> 16:06.633
there are plenty
of single women out there

16:06.667 --> 16:09.934
that have just the kind
of bowls I'm looking for.

16:09.968 --> 16:12.133
So test me, Peg,

16:12.167 --> 16:15.233
and you'll see me sitting
in a bathroom

16:15.267 --> 16:16.667
in a penthouse apartment

16:16.701 --> 16:20.467
with a blond with a match
waiting outside the door.

16:30.067 --> 16:32.233
Mother-in-law
visiting again?

16:32.267 --> 16:34.066
Yeah. How about you?

16:34.100 --> 16:35.633
My daughter's home
from college.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.367
Ah, that's rough.

16:37.834 --> 16:39.366
Hey, new guy.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.166
What are you in for?

16:41.200 --> 16:43.066
Wife made the bathroom pink.

16:43.100 --> 16:45.501
Ho!
Whoo!

16:57.100 --> 16:58.800
Thanks, guys.

16:58.834 --> 16:59.834
What's it like in there?

16:59.868 --> 17:01.999
White, cool,

17:02.033 --> 17:03.266
graffiti disparaging women,

17:03.300 --> 17:05.233
and a couple of boasts
from guys about how long

17:05.267 --> 17:07.867
it would take them
to get Connie Chung pregnant.

17:11.733 --> 17:14.401
Hey, you in there.
What'd you do, fall in?

17:16.467 --> 17:18.501
Hey, the new guy's funny.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.633
Hey, ya bum.
Ah!

17:37.801 --> 17:39.099
What do we do now?

17:39.133 --> 17:40.567
Well, if you don't mind
the drive,

17:40.601 --> 17:42.733
nothing beats Barney's,
on the Wisconsin border.

17:42.767 --> 17:46.100
They don't even have gas pumps
anymore, just acres of toilets.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.099
Well, wait a minute, guys.

17:48.133 --> 17:49.800
I know I'm the new guy here,

17:49.834 --> 17:52.567
and it's not my place
to speak up, but...

17:52.601 --> 17:54.233
what're we doing?

17:54.267 --> 17:55.567
We're men.

17:55.601 --> 17:57.834
We were put
on this planet to--

17:57.868 --> 18:00.099
Well, I don't know what we were
put on this planet to do,

18:00.133 --> 18:01.567
but we're here, damn it.

18:01.601 --> 18:02.999
And we're Americans.

18:03.033 --> 18:04.333
And we have a right to use

18:04.367 --> 18:06.800
the best toilet system
in the free world.

18:06.834 --> 18:09.433
Are we to use a gas station
bathroom like some--

18:09.467 --> 18:11.600
Some common Russki?

18:12.634 --> 18:14.200
We're being driven
from our homes,

18:14.234 --> 18:15.433
room by room,

18:15.467 --> 18:19.233
running like a Frenchman
from a cap gun.

18:19.267 --> 18:21.233
And from whom?

18:21.267 --> 18:23.500
From our women.

18:23.534 --> 18:25.133
They've taken over
our closets,

18:25.167 --> 18:28.434
driven us out of our bedrooms
by their very nakedness.

18:28.934 --> 18:30.700
Now, you guys can take it,

18:30.734 --> 18:34.233
but not this Yankee
Doody Dandy.

18:34.267 --> 18:38.133
Tonight, I'm reclaiming
my toilet bowl.

18:38.167 --> 18:41.401
All right!
Yeah!

18:47.634 --> 18:49.166
So, what do we do now?

18:49.200 --> 18:51.966
Well, how bad could it be?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.401
I'm going in.

19:00.100 --> 19:04.100
Gee, I've been needing
something for church. Heh.

19:10.667 --> 19:11.633
Hi, honey.

19:11.667 --> 19:12.966
What are you doing home?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.633
I thought you were
out on the town,

19:14.667 --> 19:16.833
marking your territory.

19:17.567 --> 19:20.700
Woman, I have come to take back
what is rightfully mine.

19:20.734 --> 19:22.900
My bathroom.

19:23.467 --> 19:25.099
Oh, not now, Al.

19:25.133 --> 19:26.633
I'm really nervous.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.999
This is the first thing
I've done that I'm proud of

19:29.033 --> 19:32.733
since I got 'em to up
your MasterCard limit to $100.

19:33.367 --> 19:36.567
Hello, Mrs. Bundy.
Hello.

19:36.601 --> 19:38.367
Hi.

19:39.501 --> 19:41.366
Class...

19:41.400 --> 19:46.234
how many decorating
don'ts do we see?

19:52.801 --> 19:54.366
Oh, don't mind him.

19:54.400 --> 19:57.133
He's just choppin' wood
for his dinner.

19:57.167 --> 19:59.467
Come upstairs
and see my bathroom.

19:59.501 --> 20:02.400
Change it, Peg,
or suffer the consequences.

20:02.434 --> 20:04.366
Oh, what's the worst thing
that could happen?

20:04.400 --> 20:05.933
Ya marry me?

20:11.367 --> 20:13.434
Then I have no choice.

20:31.234 --> 20:33.966
<i>* Now, on the day
I was born *</i>

20:34.000 --> 20:36.300
<i>* The nurses
All gathered round *</i>

20:36.334 --> 20:38.667
<i>* They gazed
In wide wonder *</i>

20:38.701 --> 20:41.133
<i>* At the joy
They had found *</i>

20:41.167 --> 20:42.966
<i>* The head nurse spoke up *</i>

20:43.000 --> 20:45.867
<i>* Said leave this one alone *</i>

20:45.901 --> 20:48.233
<i>* She could tell right away *</i>

20:48.267 --> 20:50.733
<i>* That I was bad
To the bone *</i>

20:50.767 --> 20:53.166
<i>* Bad to the bone *</i>

20:53.200 --> 20:55.500
<i>* Bad to the bone *</i>

20:55.534 --> 20:57.999
<i>* B-b-b-b-bad *</i>

20:58.033 --> 21:00.433
<i>* B-b-b-b-bad *</i>

21:00.467 --> 21:02.934
<i>* B-b-b-b-bad *</i>

21:02.968 --> 21:05.333
<i>* Bad to the bone *</i>

21:05.367 --> 21:07.900
<i>* I broke a thousand hearts *</i>

21:07.934 --> 21:10.099
<i>* Before I met you *</i>

21:10.133 --> 21:12.567
<i>* I'll break
A thousand more, baby *</i>

21:12.601 --> 21:14.999
<i>* Before I am through *</i>

21:15.033 --> 21:17.300
<i>* I wanna be yours
Pretty baby *</i>

21:17.334 --> 21:19.700
<i>* Yours and yours alone *</i>

21:19.734 --> 21:22.166
<i>* I'm here to tell ya, honey *</i>

21:22.200 --> 21:24.700
<i>* That I'm bad to the bone *</i>

21:24.734 --> 21:27.033
<i>* Bad to the bone *</i>

21:27.067 --> 21:29.400
<i>* B-b-b-b-bad *</i>

21:29.434 --> 21:31.900
<i>* B-b-b-b-bad *</i>

21:31.934 --> 21:34.134
<i>* B-b-b-b-bad *</i>
