01:07.940 --> 01:09.691
<i>Troy, you ought
to stop that lying.</i>

01:09.761 --> 01:10.739
<i>I ain't lying.</i>

01:10.820 --> 01:12.539
<i>Nigger had a watermelon this big,</i>

01:12.620 --> 01:14.499
<i>talking about,
"What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"</i>

01:14.580 --> 01:17.259
<i>I'd like to fell out.
"What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"</i>

01:17.460 --> 01:19.139
And it sitting there, big as life.

01:19.220 --> 01:21.337
- What Mr. Rand say?
- He ain't said nothing.

01:21.420 --> 01:22.682
He figure, if the
nigger was too dumb

01:22.752 --> 01:24.015
to know he's carrying
a watermelon,

01:24.100 --> 01:25.898
he wasn't going to get
much sense out of him.

01:25.980 --> 01:28.779
Trying to hide that great, big,
old watermelon under his coat.

01:28.860 --> 01:31.375
Afraid to let the white
man see him carry it home.

01:31.820 --> 01:34.255
I'm like you. I ain't got no
time for them kinda people.

01:34.340 --> 01:35.854
Now, what he look like getting mad

01:35.980 --> 01:37.937
'cause he seen the man from
the union talking to Mr. Rand?

01:38.020 --> 01:41.252
He come up to me, talking about
"Troy Maxson gonna get us fired."

01:41.340 --> 01:43.536
I told him,
"Get away from me with that."

01:43.620 --> 01:46.089
He walked away from me
calling you a troublemaker.

01:46.460 --> 01:48.133
What Mr. Rand say?

01:48.220 --> 01:49.893
He ain't said nothing.
Told me to go down

01:49.980 --> 01:51.778
to the Commissioner's
office next Friday.

01:52.140 --> 01:53.460
They called me down
there to see them.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.844
Well, as long as you got
your complaint filed,

01:55.914 --> 01:56.970
they can't fire you.

01:57.060 --> 01:58.380
That's what one of them
white fellas tell me.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.695
I ain't worried
about them firing me.

01:59.780 --> 02:02.056
What, they gonna fire me
'cause I asked a question?

02:02.140 --> 02:03.210
That's all I did.

02:03.340 --> 02:05.377
I went to Mr. Rand and I asked him.

02:05.460 --> 02:06.450
I asked him, "Why?

02:06.540 --> 02:08.735
"Why you got all the white mens
driving, and the colored lifting?"

02:08.820 --> 02:10.732
Told him, "What's the matter?
Don't I count?

02:10.820 --> 02:12.812
"Think only white fellows got
sense enough to drive a truck?"

02:12.900 --> 02:15.176
"Hell, that ain't no paper job.
Anybody can drive a truck.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.456
"How come you got all the whites
driving and the colored lifting?"

02:20.180 --> 02:22.854
He told me, "Take it to the union."
Well, hell, that's what I done.

02:22.940 --> 02:25.091
Now they want to come up
with this pack of lies.

02:25.180 --> 02:27.615
I told Brownie if the man come
and ask him any questions,

02:27.740 --> 02:29.015
just tell the truth.

02:29.100 --> 02:30.525
Ain't nothing but
somebody trumped it up

02:30.595 --> 02:32.056
on you 'cause you
filed a complaint on.

02:32.140 --> 02:33.415
Brownie ain't got that much sense.

02:33.500 --> 02:34.695
Man wasn't thinking about nothing.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.612
All I want them to do is
change the job description,

02:36.700 --> 02:38.339
give everybody a chance
to drive the truck.

02:40.340 --> 02:43.014
Brownie can't see that.
He ain't got that much sense.

03:04.180 --> 03:05.500
How you figure he be making out

03:05.580 --> 03:08.015
with that gal,
be up in Taylors' all the time?

03:08.100 --> 03:09.819
- That Alberta gal?
- Who?

03:09.900 --> 03:11.220
Brownie.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.690
Same as you and me,
getting about as much as we is.

03:13.780 --> 03:16.249
- Which is to say nothing.
- It is, huh?

03:16.340 --> 03:18.855
Well, I figure you doing
a little better than me.

03:18.940 --> 03:20.499
And I ain't saying what I'm doing!

03:20.820 --> 03:22.459
Nigger, look here. I know you.

03:22.540 --> 03:24.497
If you had gotten
anywhere near that gal,

03:24.580 --> 03:26.811
20 minutes later,
you'd be looking to tell somebody.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.300
And the first one you
gonna want to tell,

03:28.380 --> 03:30.337
that you gonna want to
brag to is going to be me.

03:30.420 --> 03:32.810
I ain't saying that.

03:32.900 --> 03:34.937
I see where you be eyeing her.

03:35.020 --> 03:37.410
I eye all the women.
I don't miss nothing.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.696
Don't never let nobody tell you
Troy Maxson don't eye the women.

03:39.780 --> 03:41.100
Hey,
you been doing more than eyeing her.

03:41.180 --> 03:42.375
You done bought her a drink or two.

03:42.460 --> 03:43.780
Hell, yeah, I bought her a drink.
What that mean?

03:43.860 --> 03:45.055
I bought you one, too.

03:45.140 --> 03:46.779
What that mean,
'cause I buy her a drink?

03:46.900 --> 03:47.711
I'm just being polite.

03:47.781 --> 03:49.256
It's all right to
buy her one drink.

03:49.340 --> 03:51.059
That's what you call being polite.

03:51.140 --> 03:52.859
But when you want to
be buying two or three,

03:52.940 --> 03:54.340
that's what you call eyeing her.

03:54.420 --> 03:56.093
Look here.
As long as you've known me,

03:56.180 --> 03:58.058
you ever known me to
chase after women?

03:58.140 --> 04:01.850
Hell, yeah! Long as I've known you.
You're forgetting, I knew you when.

04:01.940 --> 04:04.694
I'm talking about since
I been married to Rose.

04:04.780 --> 04:06.180
Not since you been married to Rose.

04:06.260 --> 04:07.974
That's the truth, though.
I can say that.

04:08.044 --> 04:09.458
All right then.
Case closed.

04:10.100 --> 04:12.820
I see you be walking up
around Alberta's house.

04:12.900 --> 04:15.699
You supposed to be at Taylors',
and you be walking up around there.

04:15.780 --> 04:16.850
What you watching
where I'm walking for?

04:16.940 --> 04:18.089
I don't be watching after you.

04:18.180 --> 04:20.091
No, I seen you walking
around there more than once.

04:20.180 --> 04:21.534
Hell, you liable to see
me walking anywhere.

04:21.620 --> 04:23.577
That don't mean nothing 'cause
you seen me walking around there.

04:23.660 --> 04:24.855
Where'd she come from, anyway?

04:24.980 --> 04:26.209
She just kinda showed up one day.

04:26.300 --> 04:26.856
Tallahassee.

04:26.926 --> 04:29.611
You can look at that and tell
she one of them Florida gals.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.931
They got some big,
healthy women down there.

04:32.020 --> 04:33.852
Grow them right up
out of the ground.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.499
She got a little bit
of Indian in her.

04:35.580 --> 04:37.458
Most of them niggers in Florida
got some Indian in them.

04:37.540 --> 04:39.577
Yeah,
I don't know about that Indian part,

04:39.660 --> 04:42.619
but she damn sure big and healthy.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.737
Woman wears some big stockings.

04:44.820 --> 04:48.973
Got them crazy big legs, and hips
wide as the Mississippi River.

04:49.060 --> 04:50.540
Legs don't mean nothing.

04:50.620 --> 04:52.213
You don't do nothing but push
'em out of the way.

04:52.340 --> 04:53.899
But them hips,

04:53.980 --> 04:56.939
- they cushion the ride.
- Troy, you ain't got no sense!

04:57.020 --> 05:00.013
It's the truth.
Like you riding on Goodyears!

05:03.180 --> 05:05.137
What you all out here getting into?

05:05.220 --> 05:07.496
What you worried about what
we getting into for, woman?

05:07.580 --> 05:08.616
This is men talk.

05:08.700 --> 05:10.020
What I care what you
all are talking about?

05:10.100 --> 05:11.454
Bono, you gonna stay for supper?

05:11.540 --> 05:12.860
No, thank you, Rose,

05:12.940 --> 05:15.216
but Lucille say she cooking
up a pot of pigfeet.

05:15.300 --> 05:17.337
Pigfeet?
Hell, I'm going home with you.

05:17.420 --> 05:19.776
I might even stay the night,
you got some pigfeet.

05:19.860 --> 05:21.658
You got something in there
to top them pigfeet, Rose?

05:21.740 --> 05:23.971
I'm cooking up some chicken. I got
some chicken and collard greens.

05:24.060 --> 05:25.255
Well, you go on back in the house.

05:25.340 --> 05:26.660
Let me and Bono finish
what we talking about.

05:26.740 --> 05:29.460
This is men talk.
I got some talk for you later.

05:29.540 --> 05:31.532
And you know what kind
of talk I mean, too.

05:31.620 --> 05:33.100
You go on in there and powder it up.

05:33.180 --> 05:34.580
Troy, stop it!

05:35.860 --> 05:37.453
Woman, come here.

05:38.740 --> 05:40.936
Look here, Bono.

05:41.020 --> 05:43.455
When I first met this woman,

05:43.540 --> 05:45.338
I got out that place.

05:45.420 --> 05:48.379
<i>Hitch up my pony, saddle up my mare</i>

05:48.460 --> 05:51.100
<i>There's a woman out
there for me somewhere</i>

05:51.180 --> 05:55.094
I looked at here, looked at there,
saw Rose, and I latched on to her.

05:55.180 --> 05:56.864
I latched on to her
and I told her...

05:56.934 --> 05:58.571
Now,
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

05:58.860 --> 06:03.139
I latched on to her and told her,
"Baby, I don't want to marry.

06:03.220 --> 06:04.859
"I just want to be your man."

06:04.940 --> 06:07.375
Rose told me...
Tell him what you told me, Ro.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.298
I told him if he wasn't
the marrying kind,

06:09.380 --> 06:11.611
then move out of the way,
so the marrying kind could find me.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.135
That's what she told me,
"Nigger, you in my way.

06:14.220 --> 06:15.540
"You blocking the view.

06:15.620 --> 06:17.577
"Move out the way,
so I can find me a husband."

06:17.660 --> 06:20.095
- I thought it over 2-3 days.
- Two-three days, nothing.

06:20.220 --> 06:21.654
You was back the same night.

06:21.740 --> 06:23.891
I come back, told her, "Okay, baby,

06:23.980 --> 06:25.778
"but I'm gonna buy
me a banty rooster

06:25.860 --> 06:27.499
"and put him out
there in the backyard.

06:27.580 --> 06:29.014
"And when he see a stranger come,

06:29.100 --> 06:30.500
"he gonna flap his wings and crow."

06:30.580 --> 06:32.651
Look here, Bono. I done watched
that front door by myself.

06:32.740 --> 06:35.494
It was that back door
I was worried about.

06:35.580 --> 06:38.015
Don't talk like that!
Troy, you're not but telling a lie.

06:38.340 --> 06:41.229
Only thing was, we first got
married, nforget the rooster.

06:41.299 --> 06:42.414
We ain't had no yard.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.650
I hear you tell it.

06:43.740 --> 06:46.130
Me and Lucille was staying
down there on Logan Street.

06:46.220 --> 06:48.689
Had two rooms with the
outhouse in the back.

06:48.780 --> 06:50.373
I ain't mind the outhouse none.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.969
But when that goddamn wind blew
through there in the winter,

06:53.060 --> 06:54.779
that's what I'm talking about!

06:55.100 --> 06:55.694
To this day,

06:55.764 --> 06:58.980
I wonder why the hell I ever stayed
down there for six long years.

06:59.060 --> 07:01.529
But, see,
I didn't know I could do no better.

07:01.620 --> 07:04.340
I thought only white folks
had inside toilets and things.

07:04.420 --> 07:05.615
A lot of folks don't think

07:05.700 --> 07:07.259
they can do no better
than they're doing now.

07:07.340 --> 07:08.730
Just something you gotta learn.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.458
A lot of folks still
shop at Bella's.

07:10.540 --> 07:12.133
Ain't nothing wrong with Bella's.
She got fresh food.

07:12.220 --> 07:14.052
I ain't said nothing about
if she got fresh food.

07:14.140 --> 07:15.460
I'm talking about what she charge.

07:15.540 --> 07:17.418
She charges 10 cents
more than the A&P.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.059
A&P ain't never done nothing for me.

07:19.140 --> 07:20.972
I spend my money where
I'm treated right.

07:21.060 --> 07:22.380
I go down to Bella, say,

07:22.460 --> 07:24.895
"I need a loaf of bread, I'll pay
you Friday," she gives it to me.

07:24.980 --> 07:26.812
What sense that make
when I got money

07:26.900 --> 07:28.220
to spend it somewhere else

07:28.300 --> 07:29.893
and ignore the person
who done right by me?

07:29.980 --> 07:31.016
That ain't in the Bible.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.375
We ain't talking about
what's in the Bible.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.651
What sense it make to shop
there when she overcharges?

07:34.740 --> 07:36.220
Well, you do your shopping
where you want to,

07:36.340 --> 07:37.854
I do my shopping where
people been good to me.

07:37.940 --> 07:39.897
I don't think it's right for
her to overcharge, that's all.

07:39.980 --> 07:41.130
Look here, I got to be getting on.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.660
Lucille gonna be raising
all kind of hell.

07:42.780 --> 07:44.339
Where you going, nigger?
We ain't finished this pint.

07:44.420 --> 07:45.536
Come here finish this pint.

07:45.700 --> 07:49.580
Well, hell, I am,
if you ever turn the bottle loose.

07:49.660 --> 07:51.718
Only thing I'll say
about the A&P is,

07:51.788 --> 07:54.018
I'm glad Cory got
that job down there.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.893
Help him with his school
clothes and things.

07:55.980 --> 07:58.290
Gabe done moved out,
things getting tight around here.

07:58.380 --> 07:59.609
He got that job,

07:59.700 --> 08:01.259
he can start to look
out for himself.

08:01.340 --> 08:04.572
Cory done got recruited by
a college football team.

08:04.700 --> 08:07.818
I told that boy about that
college football stuff.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.699
The white man ain't gonna let him
get nowhere with that football.

08:10.780 --> 08:12.772
I told him when he first
come to me with it.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.455
Now, you come telling me he
done got more tied up in it.

08:15.540 --> 08:17.611
He ought to get recruited
in how to fix cars,

08:17.700 --> 08:18.895
or some way he can make a living.

08:19.020 --> 08:21.410
He ain't talking about making
no living playing football.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.492
It's just something
the boys in school do.

08:23.580 --> 08:25.697
They're gonna send a recruiter by
to talk to you. He'll tell you.

08:25.780 --> 08:27.772
He ain't talking about making
no living playing football.

08:27.860 --> 08:29.374
It's an honor to be recruited.

08:29.460 --> 08:31.895
It ain't gonna get him nowhere,
Bono'll tell you that.

08:32.220 --> 08:35.258
If he be like you in sports,
he gonna be all right.

08:35.340 --> 08:37.808
Ain't but two men ever
played baseball good as you.

08:37.940 --> 08:39.977
That's Babe Ruth and Josh Gibson.

08:40.059 --> 08:42.211
Them the only two men ever
hit more home runs than you.

08:42.299 --> 08:44.576
And what it ever get me?
I ain't got a pot to piss in,

08:44.700 --> 08:45.975
or a window to throw it out of.

08:46.060 --> 08:47.813
Times have changed since you
were playing baseball, Troy.

08:47.900 --> 08:49.937
That was before the war.
Times have changed a lot since then.

08:50.020 --> 08:51.090
How the hell they done changed?

08:51.180 --> 08:52.694
They got a lot of colored
boys playing ball now.

08:52.780 --> 08:54.134
Baseball and football.

08:54.220 --> 08:57.258
You right about that, Ro.
Times have changed, Troy.

08:57.340 --> 08:58.694
You just come along too early.

08:58.780 --> 09:02.456
There ought not never have been
no time called "too early."

09:03.980 --> 09:06.211
Now you take that fellow...

09:06.300 --> 09:07.548
What's that fellow
they had playing

09:07.618 --> 09:08.974
right field back then
for the Yankees?

09:09.060 --> 09:10.130
You remember who I'm talking about,
Bono,

09:10.220 --> 09:11.176
played right field for The Yankees.

09:11.260 --> 09:12.899
- Selkirk?
- Yeah, Selkirk, that's it!

09:13.020 --> 09:16.331
Man's batting 269, you understand?
269!

09:16.420 --> 09:20.130
What sense that make?
I'm batting 432 with 37 home runs!

09:20.220 --> 09:23.213
He's batting 269,
playing right field for the Yankees!

09:23.300 --> 09:25.417
I saw Josh Gibson's
daughter yesterday.

09:25.500 --> 09:28.174
She's running around with
raggedy shoes on her feet.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.819
I bet you Selkirk's daughter
ain't running around

09:29.900 --> 09:31.698
with no raggedy shoes on her feet.
I bet you that.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.612
They got a lot of colored
baseball players now.

09:33.700 --> 09:34.850
Jackie Robinson was the first.

09:34.940 --> 09:36.374
Folks had to wait
for Jackie Robinson.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.232
I done seen 100
niggers play baseball

09:38.302 --> 09:39.698
better than Jackie Robinson.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.693
Hell, I seen some teams Jackie
Robinson couldn't even make!

09:42.780 --> 09:44.055
What you talking about,
Jackie Robinson?

09:44.140 --> 09:45.813
Jackie Robinson wasn't nobody!

09:45.900 --> 09:47.300
I'm talking about if
you could play ball,

09:47.380 --> 09:48.700
then they ought to let you play.

09:48.780 --> 09:49.975
Don't matter what color you are.

09:50.060 --> 09:51.699
Telling me I come along too early.

09:51.780 --> 09:55.057
If you can play,
then they ought to let you play.

09:55.140 --> 09:56.870
You gonna drink yourself to death.

09:56.940 --> 09:58.975
You don't need to be
drinking like that.

09:59.980 --> 10:01.539
Death ain't nothing.
I done seen him,

10:01.620 --> 10:03.930
I done wrestled with him. You
can't tell me nothing about death.

10:04.020 --> 10:07.297
Death ain't nothing but a
fastball on the outside corner,

10:07.380 --> 10:11.215
and you know what I do with that.
Look here, Bono, am I lying?

10:11.300 --> 10:14.134
You get one of them
fastballs about waist high

10:14.220 --> 10:15.813
on the outside corner of the plate

10:15.900 --> 10:17.619
where you can get the
meat of the bat on it,

10:17.700 --> 10:20.932
and, good God,
you could kiss it good-bye.

10:21.020 --> 10:22.977
- Am I lying?
- No, you telling the truth.

10:23.140 --> 10:24.574
I seen you do it.

10:24.660 --> 10:29.780
If I'm lying, that's 450 feet worth
of lying. That's all death is to me.

10:29.860 --> 10:32.295
A fastball on the outside corner.

10:32.380 --> 10:34.690
I don't know why you want to
get on talking about death?

10:34.780 --> 10:36.100
Ain't nothing wrong with
talking about death.

10:36.180 --> 10:37.899
That's a part of life!
Everybody gonna die.

10:38.020 --> 10:39.295
You gonna die. I'm gonna die.

10:39.380 --> 10:41.178
Bono gonna die.
Hell, we all gonna die.

10:41.260 --> 10:43.616
But you ain't got to talk about it.
I don't like talking about it.

10:43.700 --> 10:44.895
Well, you the one brought it up.

10:44.980 --> 10:46.539
Me and Bono talking about baseball.

10:46.620 --> 10:48.577
You come telling me I'm
gonna drink myself to death.

10:48.660 --> 10:49.935
Ain't that right, Bono?

10:50.020 --> 10:52.251
Now you know I drink just
but one night out the week,

10:52.340 --> 10:53.490
that's Friday night.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.293
I drink just enough to
where I can handle it.

10:55.380 --> 10:56.894
Then I leaves it alone.
I cuts it loose.

10:56.980 --> 10:59.017
So, you ain't got to worry about
me drinking myself to death

10:59.140 --> 11:00.699
'cause I ain't worrying about death.

11:00.780 --> 11:03.454
I done seen him,
done wrestled with him.

11:03.540 --> 11:04.815
Look here, Bono.

11:04.900 --> 11:05.909
I look up one day,

11:05.979 --> 11:08.052
and Death is marching
straight at me,

11:08.140 --> 11:10.257
like soldiers on parade.

11:10.340 --> 11:12.696
The Army of Death was
marching straight at me.

11:12.780 --> 11:16.137
It was the middle of July, 1941.

11:16.220 --> 11:18.451
And it got real cold,
just like it be winter.

11:18.540 --> 11:20.133
And it seemed like Death, himself,

11:20.220 --> 11:22.257
reached out and touched
me on the shoulder.

11:22.340 --> 11:25.617
He touched me like I touch you now.
I got cold as ice.

11:25.700 --> 11:26.975
Death standing there,
grinning at me.

11:27.060 --> 11:28.779
Troy, why don't you hush that talk.

11:28.860 --> 11:32.137
I said, "What you want, Mr. Death?
You be wanting me?

11:32.220 --> 11:34.098
"You done sent your
army to be getting me?"

11:34.180 --> 11:35.136
I looked him dead in the eye.

11:35.220 --> 11:36.290
I wasn't fearing nothing.

11:36.380 --> 11:39.054
I was ready to tangle,
just like I'm ready to tangle now!

11:39.420 --> 11:41.298
Bible says be ever vigilant.

11:41.380 --> 11:43.690
So, I don't get but so drunk.
I got to keep watch.

11:43.780 --> 11:45.373
Troy was right down
there at Mercy Hospital.

11:45.460 --> 11:46.814
You remember he had that pneumonia,

11:46.900 --> 11:48.812
laying there with a fever,
talking plumb out his head.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.175
And Death standing there,
staring at me,

11:50.300 --> 11:51.700
carrying that sickle in his hand.

11:51.780 --> 11:57.538
Finally, he say, "You want to
be bound over for another year?"

11:57.620 --> 11:59.771
Just like that. He say,

11:59.860 --> 12:03.649
"You want to be bound
over for another year?"

12:03.740 --> 12:07.734
I said, "Bound over, hell!
We can settle this right now."

12:07.860 --> 12:11.251
He kinda fell back when I said that.
And all the cold went out of me.

12:11.340 --> 12:13.332
I reached down,
I grabbed that sickle.

12:13.540 --> 12:15.213
I threw it as far
as I could throw it,

12:15.300 --> 12:16.973
and me and him
commenced to wrestling.

12:17.060 --> 12:20.576
We wrestled for... Carry the six...
Three days and three nights!

12:20.660 --> 12:22.970
Now, I don't know where
I got the strength from,

12:23.060 --> 12:24.779
'cause every time he tried
to get the best of me,

12:24.860 --> 12:26.781
I reached way deep
down inside myself,

12:26.851 --> 12:28.979
found the strength to
do him one better.

12:29.060 --> 12:30.653
Every time Troy tells that story,

12:30.740 --> 12:31.969
he find different ways to tell it,

12:32.060 --> 12:33.540
different things to make up.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.020
I ain't making up nothing, woman.

12:35.100 --> 12:36.659
I'm telling you the
facts of what happened.

12:36.740 --> 12:39.016
I wrestled with Death for
three days and three nights,

12:39.140 --> 12:41.575
and I'm standing here
to tell you about it.

12:43.900 --> 12:45.937
All right.
At the end of the third night,

12:46.020 --> 12:49.092
we done weakened each other to
where we can't even hardly move.

12:49.180 --> 12:50.170
Death stood up.

12:50.260 --> 12:52.456
He threw on that robe,
had a white robe with a hood on it.

12:52.580 --> 12:55.857
He throwed on that robe and went
off to look for that sickle.

12:55.940 --> 12:59.616
He said, "I'll be back."
Just like that. "I'll be back."

12:59.700 --> 13:02.818
I said, "Yeah?
Well, you gonna have to find me!"

13:02.900 --> 13:04.016
I wasn't no fool.

13:04.500 --> 13:05.900
I wasn't going looking for him.

13:05.980 --> 13:08.540
I know Death ain't nothing to play
with. And I know he's gonna get me.

13:08.620 --> 13:11.658
I know I got to join his army,
his camp followers.

13:11.740 --> 13:14.619
But as long as I keep up my
strength and see him coming,

13:14.700 --> 13:18.580
as long as I keep up my vigilance,
he gonna have to fight to get me.

13:18.660 --> 13:19.935
I ain't going easy.

13:20.340 --> 13:24.016
Well, look here, since you
got to keep up your vigilance,

13:24.100 --> 13:25.534
let me have the bottle.

13:25.620 --> 13:27.532
Hell,
I shouldn't have told you that part.

13:27.620 --> 13:28.736
I should have left out that part.

13:28.820 --> 13:30.300
Troy be talking all that stuff.

13:30.380 --> 13:32.736
Half the time, he don't even
know what he be talking about!

13:32.860 --> 13:33.876
Yeah,
Bono know me better than that.

13:33.946 --> 13:34.817
That's right, I know you.

13:34.900 --> 13:38.098
I know you got some Uncle
Remus in your blood.

13:38.180 --> 13:40.456
You got more stories than
the devil got sinners.

13:40.540 --> 13:43.135
Hell, I done seen him, too.
Done talked to the devil.

13:43.220 --> 13:44.859
Nobody wants to be
hearing that stuff!

13:47.740 --> 13:48.935
Hey, Pop.

13:49.020 --> 13:50.534
What you come "Hey, Poppin'" me for?

13:50.620 --> 13:52.691
How you doing, Rose?

13:52.780 --> 13:55.295
Mr. Bono, how you doing?

13:55.380 --> 13:57.053
Hey, Lyons, how you been?

13:57.140 --> 13:58.574
He must've been doing all right.

13:58.660 --> 13:59.810
I ain't seen him
around here last week.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.539
Troy, leave your boy alone.
He come by to see you

14:01.620 --> 14:03.134
and you want to start
all that nonsense.

14:03.220 --> 14:04.540
I ain't bothering Lyons.
Here, get you a drink.

14:04.620 --> 14:06.100
Me and him got an understanding.

14:06.180 --> 14:09.332
I know why he come by to see me,
and he know I know.

14:09.420 --> 14:11.298
Come on, Pop.
I just stopped by to say hi,

14:11.380 --> 14:12.450
see how you was doing.

14:12.540 --> 14:14.532
- You ain't stopped by yesterday.
- You staying for supper, Lyons?

14:14.620 --> 14:15.849
I got some chicken
cooking in the oven.

14:15.940 --> 14:17.738
No, Rose, thanks.
I just was in the neighborhood

14:17.820 --> 14:19.220
and thought I'd stop
by for a minute.

14:19.300 --> 14:20.780
Yeah, you was in the
neighborhood all right.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.135
Nigger, you telling the truth there.

14:22.220 --> 14:23.973
You was in the neighborhood
'cause it's my payday.

14:24.060 --> 14:26.291
Well, hell, since you mentioned it,
let me have $10.

14:27.020 --> 14:30.138
I'll be damned.
I'll die and go to hell

14:30.220 --> 14:32.689
and play blackjack with the
devil before I give you $10.

14:32.780 --> 14:35.659
That's what I want to know about,
that devil you done seen.

14:35.740 --> 14:37.891
Pop done seen the devil?
You too much, Pop.

14:37.980 --> 14:40.211
- Yeah, I done seen him.
- He ain't seen no devil.

14:40.300 --> 14:42.417
I told him that man ain't had
nothing to do with the devil.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.571
Anything he can't understand,
he want to call it the devil.

14:44.660 --> 14:47.858
Look here, Bono. I go by
Hertzberger's to get some furniture.

14:47.940 --> 14:50.739
You got three rooms for $298.
That what it say on the radio.

14:50.820 --> 14:54.177
"Three rooms, $298."
He made up a little song about it.

14:54.260 --> 14:57.253
I get down there,
man tell me I can't get no credit.

14:57.340 --> 14:59.571
I'm working every day,
can't get no credit.

14:59.660 --> 15:00.776
What to do?

15:00.900 --> 15:02.573
I got an empty house with
some raggedy furniture.

15:02.700 --> 15:03.816
Cory ain't got no bed.

15:03.900 --> 15:06.017
He's sleeping on a pile
of rags on the floor.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.137
Working every day,
can't get no credit.

15:08.220 --> 15:09.620
I come back here, Rose'll tell you,

15:09.700 --> 15:11.578
madder than hell,
trying to figure out what to do.

15:11.900 --> 15:13.016
Come a knock on the door.

15:13.100 --> 15:15.137
I ain't been living but three days,
who know I'm here?

15:15.260 --> 15:17.377
I open the door.
Devil standing there.

15:17.460 --> 15:18.496
Bigger than life.

15:18.580 --> 15:20.458
White fella,
got on good clothes and everything.

15:20.540 --> 15:21.690
Standing there with a
clipboard in his hand.

15:21.780 --> 15:23.055
Now, I ain't got to say nothing.

15:23.180 --> 15:24.614
First words come out of his mouth,

15:24.700 --> 15:27.534
"I understand you need some
furniture and can't get no credit."

15:27.620 --> 15:31.091
I liked to fell over. He said, "I'll
give you all the credit you want,

15:31.180 --> 15:33.172
"but you gonna have to
pay the interest on it."

15:33.260 --> 15:34.694
Now, I told him,
he give me them three rooms,

15:34.780 --> 15:36.260
he can charge whatever he want.

15:36.340 --> 15:37.979
Next day, a truck pull up here,

15:38.060 --> 15:39.699
two men unload them three rooms.

15:39.820 --> 15:42.016
Man what drove the
truck give me a book.

15:42.100 --> 15:45.537
Said first of the month,
send $10 to the address in the book,

15:45.660 --> 15:46.730
everything'll be fine.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.300
Said if you miss a payment,

15:48.380 --> 15:51.054
the devil was coming back,
and there'll be hell to pay.

15:51.140 --> 15:52.654
That was 15 years ago.

15:52.740 --> 15:56.256
To this day, first day of
every month, I send my $10,

15:56.380 --> 15:57.734
just like clockwork.
Rose'll tell you.

15:57.820 --> 16:00.654
- Troy lying.
- I ain't never seen that man since.

16:00.740 --> 16:01.309
Now, you tell me,

16:01.379 --> 16:02.618
who else that gonna
be but the devil?

16:02.700 --> 16:04.771
And I ain't sold my soul
or nothing like that.

16:04.860 --> 16:07.580
No, I wouldn't have truck with
the devil over nothing like that.

16:07.660 --> 16:11.256
But I got my furniture. And I
send my $10, just like clockwork.

16:11.340 --> 16:14.219
How long you say you been
paying this $10 a month?

16:14.300 --> 16:15.336
15 years.

16:15.420 --> 16:17.413
Hell, ain't you finished
paying for it yet?

16:17.483 --> 16:19.096
How much the man
done charge you?

16:19.180 --> 16:22.412
Hell, I done paid for it.
I done paid for it 10 times over.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.775
Fact is, I'm scared to stop paying.

16:23.860 --> 16:26.295
Troy lying. We got that
furniture from Mr. Glickman.

16:26.380 --> 16:28.099
He ain't paying no
$10 a month to nobody.

16:28.180 --> 16:30.456
Hell, woman,
Bono know I ain't that big a fool.

16:30.580 --> 16:31.698
I was just getting ready to say,

16:31.768 --> 16:33.095
I know where there's
a bridge for sale.

16:33.180 --> 16:34.250
I'll tell you this.

16:34.340 --> 16:36.093
It don't matter to me
if it was the devil.

16:36.180 --> 16:37.534
It don't matter if
the devil give credit.

16:37.620 --> 16:39.532
- Somebody got to give it.
- It ought to matter.

16:39.620 --> 16:41.896
You walking around here saying you
gonna make truck with the devil,

16:41.980 --> 16:43.414
God's the one you're
gonna have to answer to.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.014
He's the one gonna
be at the Judgment.

16:45.100 --> 16:47.012
Yeah, well, look here,
Pop, let me have that $10.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.256
I'll give it back to you.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.774
Bonnie got a job
working at the hospital.

16:49.860 --> 16:50.930
Bono, what did I tell you?

16:51.060 --> 16:52.619
Only time I see this nigger
is when he want something.

16:52.700 --> 16:53.850
That's the only time I see him.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.490
Come on, Pop, Mr. Bono
don't want to hear all that.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.776
Let me have the $10.
I told you, Bonnie's working!

16:58.940 --> 17:00.215
What that mean to me
if Bonnie's working?

17:00.300 --> 17:03.452
I don't care if she working.
Go ask her for $10 if she's working.

17:03.540 --> 17:06.214
Talking about Bonnie working.
Why ain't you working?

17:06.619 --> 17:08.656
Pop,
you know I can't find no decent job.

17:08.740 --> 17:10.696
Where am I gonna get a job at?
You know I can't get no job.

17:10.900 --> 17:13.096
I told you,
I know some people down there.

17:13.180 --> 17:15.012
I can get you on the
rubbish if you want to work.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.898
I told you that last time you come
back here asking for something.

17:17.980 --> 17:19.255
No, Pop, thanks, that ain't for me.

17:19.380 --> 17:20.859
I don't want to be
carrying nobody's rubbish.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.771
I don't want to be punching
nobody's time clock.

17:22.859 --> 17:24.852
What's the matter? You too
good to carry people's rubbish?

17:24.940 --> 17:26.818
Where you think that $10 you
talking about comes from?

17:26.900 --> 17:28.653
I'm just supposed to
haul people's rubbish

17:28.740 --> 17:30.618
and give my money to you
'cause you too lazy to work?

17:30.700 --> 17:31.816
You're too lazy to work

17:31.900 --> 17:33.493
and want to know why you
ain't got what I got.

17:33.580 --> 17:35.219
What hospital Bonnie working at,
Mercy?

17:35.300 --> 17:37.053
She down at Passavant,
working in the laundry.

17:37.140 --> 17:38.972
I ain't got nothing as it is.
I give you $10,

17:39.060 --> 17:40.414
I got to eat beans
the rest of the week?

17:40.500 --> 17:41.900
No,
you ain't getting no $10 over here.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.500
You ain't got to be eating no beans.

17:43.580 --> 17:44.855
I don't know why you
want to say that?

17:44.940 --> 17:46.772
I ain't got no extra money!

17:48.660 --> 17:49.810
Gabe done moved out,

17:49.900 --> 17:52.256
giving his money over there to
Miss Pearl, paying her rent.

17:52.340 --> 17:53.535
Things done got tight around here.

17:53.620 --> 17:55.100
I can't afford to be
giving you every payday.

17:55.180 --> 17:56.626
I ain't asked you
to give me nothing.

17:56.696 --> 17:57.820
I asked you to loan me $10.

17:57.900 --> 17:58.970
I know you got $10.

17:59.060 --> 18:01.177
Yeah, I got it.
You know why I got it?

18:01.260 --> 18:03.536
'Cause I don't throw my
money away on them streets.

18:03.620 --> 18:05.657
You want to live the fast life,
being a musician,

18:05.740 --> 18:07.379
running around in
them clubs and things,

18:07.460 --> 18:08.894
then learn to take care of yourself.

18:08.980 --> 18:12.132
You ain't gone find me
asking nobody for nothing!

18:12.220 --> 18:13.540
I spent too many years without.

18:13.620 --> 18:15.054
Hey,
you and me is two different people.

18:15.140 --> 18:18.372
I done learned my mistake and I
learned to do what's right by it.

18:18.460 --> 18:20.133
You still trying to get
something for nothing.

18:20.220 --> 18:21.370
Life don't owe you nothing.

18:21.460 --> 18:24.055
You owe it to yourself. Ask Bono.
He'll tell you I'm right.

18:24.140 --> 18:26.575
You got your way of dealing
with the world, I got mine.

18:26.660 --> 18:28.458
Only thing that matters
to me is the music.

18:28.820 --> 18:30.891
Yeah, I can see that.
Don't matter how you gonna eat,

18:30.980 --> 18:32.334
don't matter where your
next dollar coming from.

18:32.420 --> 18:33.900
Yeah, you telling the truth there.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.051
I know I got to eat.
But I got to live, too.

18:36.300 --> 18:38.531
I need something that's gonna help
me get out of bed in the morning,

18:38.620 --> 18:40.134
make me feel like I
belong in the world.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.893
I don't bother nobody.

18:41.980 --> 18:43.130
I just stay with my music

18:43.220 --> 18:45.371
'cause that's the only way I
can find to live in the world.

18:45.460 --> 18:48.055
Otherwise,
ain't no telling what I might do.

18:48.140 --> 18:51.019
I don't come by criticizing
you and how you live.

18:51.340 --> 18:53.059
I just come by to ask you for $10.

18:53.180 --> 18:55.251
I don't want to hear all
that about how I live.

18:55.340 --> 18:57.775
Boy, your mama did a hell
of a job raising you.

18:57.860 --> 19:00.534
You can't change me, Pop.
I'm 34 years old.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.535
If you wanted to change me,

19:02.620 --> 19:04.373
you should have been there
when I was growing up.

19:04.860 --> 19:07.250
I come by to see you,
ask you for $10,

19:07.340 --> 19:10.094
and you want to talk
about how I was raised?

19:10.180 --> 19:13.696
You don't know nothing
about how I was raised.

19:19.220 --> 19:21.610
Let the boy have $10, Troy.

19:25.980 --> 19:28.893
Hell you looking at?
You know I ain't got no money.

19:28.980 --> 19:30.812
You know what I do with my money.

19:30.900 --> 19:32.732
Go on, give him $10 if
you want him to have it.

19:33.100 --> 19:36.138
I will, soon as you turn it loose.

19:39.060 --> 19:40.972
There it is.

19:41.060 --> 19:43.097
Seventy six dollars
and twenty-two cents.

19:43.620 --> 19:46.454
You see this, Bono? I ain't
gonna get but six of that back.

19:46.540 --> 19:49.533
He ought to stop telling that lie.
Here, Lyons.

19:49.820 --> 19:50.970
Thanks, Rose.

19:56.300 --> 19:57.654
Look, I got to run.
I'll see you all later.

19:57.740 --> 19:59.891
Wait a minute.
You gonna say, "Thanks, Rose,"

19:59.980 --> 20:01.812
but you ain't gonna look to see
where she got that money from.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.017
- You see how they do me, Bono?
- I know she got it from you, Pop.

20:04.100 --> 20:06.456
- Thanks. I'll give it back to you.
- There you go, telling another lie.

20:06.540 --> 20:08.771
Time I see that $10,
you'll be owing me $30 more.

20:08.860 --> 20:10.738
- See you, Mr. Bono.
- Take care, Lyons.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.890
Thanks, Pop. I'll see you again.

20:15.340 --> 20:18.333
I don't know why that boy don't
go and get him a decent job

20:18.420 --> 20:19.695
and take care of that woman he got.

20:19.780 --> 20:22.295
He'll be all right, Troy.
The boy is still young!

20:22.540 --> 20:26.011
- The boy is 34 years old.
- Let's not get off into all that.

20:26.100 --> 20:29.252
Look here, I got to go. I got to
be going. Lucille gonna be waiting.

20:29.340 --> 20:33.414
See this woman, Bono?
I love this woman.

20:34.020 --> 20:36.933
I love her so much, it hurts.

20:37.020 --> 20:41.060
I love her so much, I done
run out of ways of loving her,

20:41.140 --> 20:43.371
so, I got to get back to basics.

20:43.620 --> 20:45.213
Don't you come by my
house Monday morning,

20:45.300 --> 20:46.450
talking about time to go to work.

20:46.540 --> 20:47.955
'Cause I'm gonna
still be stroking.

20:48.025 --> 20:48.691
Troy, stop!

20:48.780 --> 20:52.091
I ain't paying him no mind, Rose.
That ain't nothing but gin talk.

20:52.180 --> 20:54.217
Go on, Troy! I'll see you Monday.

20:54.300 --> 20:56.531
Don't you come by my house, nigger!

20:58.300 --> 21:00.451
I done told you what
I'm gonna be doing!

21:02.860 --> 21:04.977
Come back on Tuesday!

21:31.060 --> 21:34.337
<i>Jesus be a fence</i>

21:34.900 --> 21:37.176
<i>All around me</i>

21:37.260 --> 21:39.058
<i>Every day</i>

21:44.660 --> 21:46.538
Good morning.

21:46.620 --> 21:48.577
You ready for breakfast?
I can fix you some

21:48.660 --> 21:50.936
soon as I finish hanging
up these clothes.

21:51.020 --> 21:53.202
I got the coffee on.
That's all right.

21:53.272 --> 21:55.572
I just have some of
that this morning.

21:57.620 --> 22:00.089
That 651 hit yesterday.

22:00.180 --> 22:03.014
That's the second time this month
Miss Pearl hit for a dollar.

22:03.100 --> 22:05.410
Seems like those that need
the least always get lucky.

22:05.540 --> 22:06.690
Poor folks can't get nothing.

22:06.780 --> 22:08.100
Them numbers don't know nobody.

22:08.180 --> 22:10.331
I don't know why you fool with 'em,
you and Lyons both.

22:10.460 --> 22:11.940
It's something to do.

22:12.020 --> 22:14.296
You ain't doing nothing but
throwing your money away.

22:14.380 --> 22:15.939
Troy,
you know I don't play foolishly.

22:16.020 --> 22:17.613
I just play a nickel
here and a nickel there.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.214
That's two nickels
you done throwed away.

22:19.300 --> 22:21.940
Nah, I hit sometimes.
That makes up for it.

22:22.020 --> 22:23.534
Always comes in handy when I do hit.

22:23.620 --> 22:24.770
I don't hear you complaining then.

22:24.860 --> 22:26.738
I ain't complaining now.
I just say it's foolish,

22:26.820 --> 22:29.972
trying to guess out of 600 ways
which way the number gonna come.

22:30.060 --> 22:31.619
If I had all the
money these niggers...

22:35.300 --> 22:39.214
You negroes throw away
on numbers in one week,

22:39.300 --> 22:42.134
just one week, I'd be a rich man.

22:42.220 --> 22:43.700
You wishing and calling it foolish

22:43.780 --> 22:45.373
ain't gonna stop folks
from playing the numbers.

22:45.460 --> 22:47.497
That's one thing for sure.

22:47.580 --> 22:50.732
Besides, some good things
come from playing numbers.

22:50.820 --> 22:53.779
Look where Pope done bought him
that restaurant off of numbers.

22:53.860 --> 22:58.491
I can't stand niggers like that. Man
ain't had two dimes to rub together.

22:58.580 --> 23:01.300
He running around with
his shoes all run-over,

23:01.380 --> 23:03.372
bumming money for cigarettes.

23:03.460 --> 23:06.373
All right.
Got lucky there, hit the numbers...

23:06.460 --> 23:07.814
Troy, I know all about it.

23:07.900 --> 23:10.654
Had good sense. I'll say that for
him. Man ain't throw his money away.

23:10.740 --> 23:14.575
I done see niggers go
through $2,000 in four days.

23:14.660 --> 23:17.175
Man built him that
restaurant down there.

23:17.260 --> 23:18.774
Fix it up real nice, too.

23:18.860 --> 23:20.738
Then he won't let nobody come in it.

23:20.820 --> 23:23.130
Negro go in there,
can't get no kind of service.

23:23.220 --> 23:26.497
Seen a white fella go in there,
he orders a bowl of stew.

23:26.620 --> 23:28.851
Pope pick all the meat
out of the pot for him.

23:28.940 --> 23:30.897
Man ain't had nothing
but a bowl of meat!

23:30.980 --> 23:32.460
Negro go in there behind him,

23:32.540 --> 23:34.497
he ain't got nothing but the
potatoes and the carrots.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.697
Talking about what
numbers do for people.

23:36.780 --> 23:38.009
You picked the wrong example there.

23:38.100 --> 23:40.171
Ain't done nothing but made
a worser fool out of him

23:40.300 --> 23:42.053
than he already was before.

23:43.740 --> 23:45.220
Troy.

23:45.300 --> 23:48.532
You ought to stop worrying about
what happened at work yesterday.

23:50.820 --> 23:52.140
I ain't worried.

23:53.700 --> 23:55.771
Just called me down there,
the Commissioner's office,

23:55.900 --> 23:58.540
everybody's worried
about them firing me.

23:58.620 --> 24:01.499
I ain't worrying
about them firing me.

24:01.580 --> 24:03.811
You ain't got to worry about that.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.051
Where's Cory? Cory in the house?

24:09.460 --> 24:11.611
- Cory!
- He gone out.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.453
Out? Yeah, he going out

24:13.540 --> 24:16.419
'cause he know I want him
to work on this fence.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.412
I know how he is.
That boy is scared of working.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.775
He ain't done a lick
of work in his life.

24:19.860 --> 24:21.340
He had to go to football practice.

24:21.420 --> 24:23.412
Coach wanted them to get
in a little extra practice

24:23.500 --> 24:24.775
before the season start.

24:24.860 --> 24:26.533
Yeah, I got his practice all right.

24:26.620 --> 24:28.896
Running out of here before
he gets his chores done.

24:28.980 --> 24:30.573
Troy,
what is wrong with you this morning?

24:30.660 --> 24:31.776
Don't nothing set right with you.

24:31.860 --> 24:34.216
Go on back in there, go to bed,
and get up on the other side.

24:34.300 --> 24:35.575
Why something got
to be wrong with me?

24:35.660 --> 24:36.730
I ain't said nothing wrong with me.

24:36.820 --> 24:38.300
Well, you got something
to say about everything.

24:38.380 --> 24:40.133
First, it's the numbers,
then it's the way the man

24:40.220 --> 24:42.052
run his restaurant,
then you done got on Cory.

24:42.140 --> 24:43.654
What's it gonna be next?

24:43.780 --> 24:45.931
Take a look up there,
see if the weather suit you.

24:46.020 --> 24:47.500
Or is it gonna be how you
gonna put up this fence

24:47.620 --> 24:48.895
with the clothes
hanging in the yard?

24:48.980 --> 24:50.573
You hit the nail on the head then.

24:50.660 --> 24:52.731
I know you like I know
the back of my hand.

24:52.820 --> 24:54.652
Come on in here and get
you some more coffee,

24:54.740 --> 24:56.299
see if that don't straighten you up.

24:56.420 --> 24:58.059
'Cause you ain't right this morning.

25:20.300 --> 25:22.212
<i>Three for a quarter</i>

25:22.660 --> 25:26.336
<i>Come and buy now
'cause I'm here today</i>

25:27.140 --> 25:29.735
<i>Yes, sir, I got plums</i>

25:30.300 --> 25:31.780
<i>Ask me how I sell 'em</i>

25:32.700 --> 25:36.091
<i>Ten cents apiece,
three for a quarter</i>

25:36.180 --> 25:37.660
<i>Come and buy now</i>

25:37.740 --> 25:38.730
Hey!

25:42.500 --> 25:45.937
<i>'Cause I'm here today</i> <i>Tomorrow,
I'll be gone</i>

25:46.020 --> 25:48.489
There's Troy. Hey, Troy.

25:50.740 --> 25:51.730
Hey, Gabe.

25:56.020 --> 25:57.534
- Hey, Rose.
- Hey, Gabe.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.134
What you got there?

25:59.220 --> 26:02.054
You know what I got, Rose?
I got fruits and vegetables.

26:02.140 --> 26:03.938
Where them plums you talking about?

26:04.020 --> 26:07.616
I ain't got no plums today.
I was just singing that.

26:07.740 --> 26:11.370
I'll have some tomorrow.
I put me in a big order for plums.

26:11.460 --> 26:16.660
I'll have enough plums tomorrow
for Saint Peter and everybody!

26:16.740 --> 26:18.094
Troy mad at me.

26:19.180 --> 26:21.570
I ain't mad at you, Gabe.
What I got to be mad at you about?

26:21.660 --> 26:22.730
You ain't done nothing to me.

26:22.820 --> 26:27.258
I just move over to Miss Pearl's
to keep out from in your way.

26:27.340 --> 26:28.569
I ain't mean no harm by it.

26:28.660 --> 26:31.778
Who said anything about that?
I ain't said nothing about that.

26:32.900 --> 26:34.653
You ain't mad at me, is you?

26:34.740 --> 26:39.337
I ain't made at you, Gabe. If I was
mad at you, I'd tell you about it.

26:39.420 --> 26:41.810
Come on, get on out of the street.
Come on.

26:45.860 --> 26:49.490
I got me two rooms in the basement.
I got my own door, too.

26:49.820 --> 26:52.130
You want to see my key?

26:53.700 --> 26:57.296
That's my own key. Ain't nobody
else got a key like that.

26:57.380 --> 26:59.212
That's my key for my two rooms.

26:59.300 --> 27:01.257
That's good, Gabe.
Got your own key, that's good.

27:01.340 --> 27:02.535
You hungry, Gabe?

27:02.620 --> 27:04.259
I was just fixing to
cook Troy some breakfast.

27:04.380 --> 27:07.020
I'll take some biscuits.
You got some biscuits?

27:08.980 --> 27:12.860
Did you know, when I was in Heaven,
every morning, me and Saint Peter

27:12.940 --> 27:16.775
would sit down by the Gate and
eat some big, fat biscuits?

27:16.860 --> 27:21.252
Yeah, we had us a good time. We'd
sit there and eat us them biscuits.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.935
And then Saint Peter
would go off to sleep,

27:24.020 --> 27:25.613
and tell me to wake him up

27:25.700 --> 27:27.976
when it's time to open the
Gates for the Judgment.

27:28.060 --> 27:32.532
Well, come on, I'll make
you a big batch of biscuits.

27:32.660 --> 27:36.574
Hey, Troy. Saint Peter got your
name in his book. I seen it.

27:36.660 --> 27:38.538
It say, "Troy Maxson."

27:38.820 --> 27:40.698
I say, "I know him.

27:40.780 --> 27:44.091
"He got the same
name like what I got.

27:44.180 --> 27:46.137
"That's my brother."

27:47.540 --> 27:49.850
How many times you gonna
tell me that, Gabe?

27:49.940 --> 27:52.978
Ain't got my name in the book.
Don't have to have my name.

27:53.060 --> 27:55.291
I done died and went to Heaven.

27:55.380 --> 27:58.373
But he got your name, though.

27:58.460 --> 28:01.771
One morning,
Saint Peter was looking at his book,

28:01.860 --> 28:04.534
and he was marking it
up for the Judgment,

28:04.620 --> 28:06.657
and he let me see your name.

28:06.740 --> 28:11.610
He got it in there under "M."
He got Rose's name.

28:11.740 --> 28:15.051
I ain't seen it like I seen yours,
but I know it's in there.

28:15.380 --> 28:18.737
He got a great big book!

28:18.820 --> 28:21.494
He got everybody's name
what was ever been born.

28:21.580 --> 28:22.855
That's what he told me.

28:23.580 --> 28:26.778
But I seen your name.
I seen it with my own eye.

28:26.860 --> 28:27.850
Come in the house.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.340
Rose gonna fix you
something to eat now.

28:29.420 --> 28:31.855
I ain't hungry. I done had breakfast

28:32.900 --> 28:34.937
with Aunt Jemima!

28:35.020 --> 28:38.172
She come by, cook me up a
whole mess of flapjacks!

28:38.260 --> 28:39.933
All right. Come on, let's go
in the house. Rose fix us...

28:40.060 --> 28:41.460
Remember how we used
to eat them flapjacks?

28:41.540 --> 28:42.690
Yes, I remember. Come on now.

28:42.780 --> 28:43.896
- I got to go!
- Gabe!

28:44.020 --> 28:45.579
- I got to go!
- Gabe, come on now!

28:45.660 --> 28:48.459
I got to go sell my plums!

28:48.540 --> 28:52.454
I done sold some tomatoes.
Got me two quarters. Want to see?

28:53.260 --> 28:55.252
I'm gonna save
'em and buy me a new horn,

28:55.340 --> 29:00.096
so Saint Peter can hear me when
it's time to open the Gate.

29:00.260 --> 29:01.694
You hear that?

29:04.100 --> 29:06.820
You hear that? That's the hellhound.

29:06.900 --> 29:08.573
I'm gonna chase them out of here.

29:08.660 --> 29:12.495
Go on! Get out of here!
Get out! Get out!

29:15.740 --> 29:17.857
<i>All you hypocrite members</i>

29:18.340 --> 29:20.252
<i>Wasting your time away</i>

29:20.580 --> 29:23.175
<i>My God is calling for a workman</i>

29:23.500 --> 29:25.412
<i>You had better obey</i>

29:25.980 --> 29:28.779
<i>Better get ready for the Judgment</i>

29:29.260 --> 29:32.253
<i>Better get ready for
the Judgment morning</i>

29:32.780 --> 29:35.500
<i>Better get ready for Judgment</i>

29:36.100 --> 29:38.934
<i>My God is coming down</i>

29:41.620 --> 29:44.613
<i>Better get ready for the Judgment</i>

29:45.740 --> 29:48.653
<i>Better get ready for
the Judgment morning</i>

29:48.940 --> 29:51.774
<i>Better get ready for the Judgment</i>

29:52.060 --> 29:54.734
<i>My God is coming down</i>

29:55.580 --> 29:58.573
<i>Better get ready for the Judgment</i>

29:59.260 --> 30:02.332
<i>Better get ready for the Judgment</i>

30:10.540 --> 30:12.497
Where's Gabe?

30:12.580 --> 30:14.492
He's gone off somewhere.

30:17.140 --> 30:18.256
He ain't eating right.

30:18.340 --> 30:20.297
Miss Pearl say she can't
get him to eat nothing.

30:20.380 --> 30:21.655
What you want me to do about it,
Rose?

30:21.740 --> 30:23.664
I did everything I
could for the man.

30:23.734 --> 30:25.177
I can't make him get well.

30:25.260 --> 30:28.458
Man got half his head blown off,
what you expect?

30:28.540 --> 30:30.213
Seems like something ought
to be done to help him.

30:30.300 --> 30:31.620
The man don't bother nobody.

30:31.700 --> 30:34.056
He just mixed up
'cause of that metal plate

30:34.140 --> 30:36.814
he got in his head.
Ain't no sense in...

30:36.900 --> 30:39.938
Thank you. Ain't no sense in
sending him to the hospital.

30:40.020 --> 30:41.340
At least he'd be eating right.

30:41.420 --> 30:42.820
They could help him
take care of himself.

30:42.900 --> 30:44.493
Don't nobody want to be locked up,
Rose.

30:44.580 --> 30:46.458
What you want to
lock the man up for?

30:46.540 --> 30:48.179
Man going down there,

30:48.260 --> 30:52.459
over there and fight that war,
messing with them Japs,

30:52.540 --> 30:54.213
getting half his head blown off.

30:54.300 --> 30:58.010
They give him a lousy $3,000.
I got to swoop down on that.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.420
Is you fixing to
get into that again?

30:59.500 --> 31:01.537
He got a metal plate in his head.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.697
That's the only reason I
got a roof over my head

31:03.780 --> 31:05.294
is 'cause of that metal plate.

31:05.380 --> 31:07.212
Ain't no sense in you
blaming yourself for nothing.

31:07.300 --> 31:09.496
Gabe was in no condition
to manage that money.

31:09.580 --> 31:10.696
You done what was right by him.

31:10.780 --> 31:12.817
Can't nobody say you ain't
done what was right by him.

31:12.900 --> 31:14.254
Look how long you took care of him.

31:14.380 --> 31:16.975
Till he wanted his own place and
moved over there with Miss Pearl.

31:17.060 --> 31:19.575
That ain't what I'm saying, woman.
I'm just...

31:22.180 --> 31:23.614
I'm just stating the facts.

31:23.700 --> 31:25.771
If my brother didn't have
a metal plate in his head,

31:25.860 --> 31:27.294
I wouldn't have a pot to piss in

31:27.380 --> 31:28.780
or a window to throw it out of.

31:28.860 --> 31:30.579
And I'm 53...

31:40.580 --> 31:42.139
Where you going off to?

31:42.220 --> 31:43.893
You been running out of here
every Saturday for weeks.

31:43.980 --> 31:46.814
I thought you were gonna
work on this fence.

31:46.900 --> 31:49.131
I'm gonna go down
to Taylors' and...

32:38.660 --> 32:39.650
Mama?

32:41.340 --> 32:43.900
Cory. Your daddy like
to have a fit with you

32:43.980 --> 32:46.859
running out of here this morning
without doing your chores.

32:46.940 --> 32:48.215
You all right?

32:48.300 --> 32:51.577
He say you supposed to be
helping him with the fence.

32:51.660 --> 32:53.060
I told you I had to go to practice.

32:53.140 --> 32:55.132
And he's been saying that the
last four or five Saturdays,

32:55.220 --> 32:58.292
and then don't ever do nothing
but go down to Taylors'.

32:59.740 --> 33:01.811
- You told him about the recruiter?
- Yeah, I told him.

33:01.900 --> 33:04.540
- Well, what'd he say?
- He didn't say nothing too much.

33:04.620 --> 33:07.260
Go on and get started on your
chores before he gets back here.

33:07.340 --> 33:09.980
Go on and scrub down them steps

33:10.060 --> 33:12.939
before he come back here
hollering and carrying on!

33:13.020 --> 33:14.852
Go! Boy, go!

33:37.460 --> 33:40.771
Go on, Troy.
You liked to scare me to death.

33:40.900 --> 33:42.050
What was the score of the game?

33:42.140 --> 33:43.972
Lucille had me on the phone.
I couldn't keep up with it.

33:44.060 --> 33:45.574
What do I care about the game?
Come here, woman.

33:45.660 --> 33:46.810
I thought you went down to Taylors'

33:46.900 --> 33:48.653
to listen to the game. Go on, Troy.

33:48.740 --> 33:50.459
I thought you're supposed
to be putting up the fence.

33:50.540 --> 33:52.896
I'll put it up when
I finish with what...

33:54.220 --> 33:55.336
Is at hand.

33:55.420 --> 33:57.491
Go on, Troy. I ain't studying you!

33:57.580 --> 34:00.493
I'm studying you.
I'm finna do my homework.

34:00.580 --> 34:02.253
Troy, you better leave me alone!

34:04.900 --> 34:06.493
Where Cory?
That boy brought his butt home yet?

34:06.580 --> 34:07.980
He's upstairs doing his chores.

34:08.060 --> 34:09.380
Cory, get your butt...

34:10.860 --> 34:13.056
- Where you going?
- I'll be right back.

34:13.139 --> 34:13.414
When?

34:13.484 --> 34:15.735
I'm just going right
down the street.

34:16.260 --> 34:19.571
Where? Who?

34:22.420 --> 34:24.092
Troy, go in the house!

34:52.300 --> 34:54.178
You just now coming here
from leaving this morning?

34:54.260 --> 34:55.121
Yeah,
I had to go to football practice...

34:55.190 --> 34:55.534
Yeah, what?

34:55.620 --> 34:56.610
Yes, sir.

34:56.699 --> 34:58.180
I ain't but two seconds off you,
no way.

34:58.260 --> 34:59.933
That garbage sitting in there,
overflowing.

35:00.020 --> 35:01.295
You ain't done none of your chores.

35:01.380 --> 35:02.575
Now you come in here,
talking about, "Yeah."

35:02.660 --> 35:04.094
I was just getting ready
to do my chores now, Pop.

35:04.180 --> 35:06.411
Your first chore is to help me
with this fence on Saturday.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.059
Everything else come after that.

35:08.140 --> 35:10.450
Now, get that saw,
we gonna cut these boards.

35:14.100 --> 35:17.571
Hey, Pop. Why don't you buy a TV?

35:17.660 --> 35:20.095
What I want with a TV?
What I want one of them for?

35:20.180 --> 35:22.979
Everybody got one.
Earl, Ba Bra, Jesse.

35:23.460 --> 35:25.258
I ain't asked who had one,
I said what I want with one?

35:25.380 --> 35:27.815
So, you can watch it.
They got lots of things on TV.

35:27.900 --> 35:29.129
- Baseball and everything.
- Yeah?

35:29.260 --> 35:30.535
We could watch the World Series.

35:30.620 --> 35:32.577
- Yeah, how much this TV cost?
- I don't know.

35:32.660 --> 35:35.255
They got 'em on sale for about $200.

35:35.340 --> 35:36.979
- $200?
- That ain't that much, Pop.

35:37.340 --> 35:39.650
No, that's just $200.

35:40.780 --> 35:42.851
You see that roof you got
sitting over your head at night?

35:43.140 --> 35:45.052
Let me tell you something
about that roof.

35:45.140 --> 35:49.020
It's been 10 years since
that roof was last tarred.

35:49.100 --> 35:52.218
See, now snow come this winter,
sit up on that roof like it is,

35:52.300 --> 35:54.257
it's gonna seep inside,
just gonna be a little bit,

35:54.340 --> 35:56.656
you ain't gonna hardly notice it,
then next thing you know,

35:56.740 --> 35:58.220
it's gonna be leaking
all over the house.

35:58.300 --> 36:00.245
Then the wood rot
from all that water,

36:00.315 --> 36:02.260
and you gonna need
a whole new roof.

36:02.340 --> 36:04.536
Now how much you think it
cost to get that roof fixed?

36:04.900 --> 36:08.860
- I don't know.
- $264 cash money. See?

36:08.940 --> 36:10.659
While you be thinking about a TV,

36:10.740 --> 36:12.698
I got to be thinking about the roof

36:12.768 --> 36:14.893
or whatever else go
wrong around here.

36:14.980 --> 36:16.892
Now if you had $200,
what would you do?

36:16.980 --> 36:19.370
Fix the roof, or buy a TV?

36:19.460 --> 36:21.850
I'd buy a TV.
And when the roof started to leak,

36:21.980 --> 36:23.255
if it needed fixing, I'd fix it.

36:23.340 --> 36:24.694
Where you gonna get your money from?

36:24.780 --> 36:26.100
You done spent it on a TV.

36:26.180 --> 36:27.396
You gonna sit up in there,

36:27.466 --> 36:29.571
let that water run all
over your brand-new TV?

36:29.660 --> 36:31.219
Pop, you got the money.
I know you do.

36:31.300 --> 36:33.019
- Where I got it at?
- In the bank.

36:33.100 --> 36:34.375
You want to see my bank book?

36:34.460 --> 36:37.259
You want to see that $73.22
I got sitting up in there?

36:37.340 --> 36:39.013
You don't have to pay
for it all at one time.

36:39.100 --> 36:40.978
You can put a down payment on it,
and carry it on with you.

36:41.060 --> 36:43.734
Not me. I ain't owing nobody
nothing if I can help it.

36:43.820 --> 36:46.380
Miss a payment, they come and
snatch it right out of your house.

36:46.460 --> 36:49.498
Then what you got? See?

36:49.580 --> 36:53.096
Now, when I get $200 clear,
I'll buy me a TV.

36:53.220 --> 36:56.577
Right now, when I get $264,
I'm gonna get that roof fixed.

36:56.660 --> 36:57.650
Pop...

36:57.740 --> 37:00.460
You go get you $200 and buy
you a TV if you want to.

37:00.540 --> 37:02.133
I got better things
to do with my money.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.451
I can't get $200.
I ain't never seen $200.

37:04.860 --> 37:06.089
All right, I'll tell you what.

37:06.180 --> 37:09.378
You get $100,
I'll put the other $100 with it.

37:09.460 --> 37:10.940
All right, I'm gonna show you.

37:11.020 --> 37:14.252
Yeah, show me how you can
cut these boards right now.

37:14.980 --> 37:17.415
There you go. That's $200 worth.

37:20.180 --> 37:21.933
- The Pirates won today.
- Yeah?

37:22.020 --> 37:23.136
That makes five in a row.

37:23.220 --> 37:25.655
I ain't thinking about no Pirates.
They got an all-white team.

37:25.740 --> 37:29.416
Got that boy, though,
that Puerto Rican boy, Clemente?

37:29.740 --> 37:30.810
Don't even half play him.

37:30.900 --> 37:32.892
That boy could be something
if they'd give him a chance.

37:33.140 --> 37:35.018
Play him one day,
sit him on the bench the next.

37:35.100 --> 37:36.329
He gets lots of chances to play.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.332
I'm talking about playing every day,
playing regular,

37:38.420 --> 37:39.979
so you can get your timing,
that's what I'm talking about.

37:40.100 --> 37:42.171
They got some white guys on the
team that don't play every day.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.489
You can't play everybody
at the same time.

37:43.580 --> 37:45.378
If they got a white fellow
sitting on the bench,

37:45.460 --> 37:48.100
you can bet your last
dollar he can't play.

37:48.180 --> 37:50.217
Colored guy got to be twice
as good to get on the team.

37:50.300 --> 37:53.099
That's why I don't want you
getting all tied up in them sports.

37:53.180 --> 37:55.217
Man on the team, what it get him?

37:55.300 --> 37:57.257
Got colored on the team,
don't even use him.

37:57.340 --> 38:00.094
Same as not having them.
All them teams the same.

38:00.180 --> 38:02.456
The Braves got Hank
Aaron and Wes Covington.

38:02.580 --> 38:04.572
Hank Aaron hit two home runs today.
That makes 43.

38:04.660 --> 38:06.617
Aaron ain't nobody.
That's what you supposed to do.

38:06.700 --> 38:08.498
That's how the game's
supposed to be played.

38:08.580 --> 38:09.287
Ain't nothing to it.

38:09.357 --> 38:11.300
It's a matter of getting your
timing and follow through.

38:11.420 --> 38:13.537
Hell,
I can hit 43 home runs right now.

38:13.620 --> 38:15.100
Not off no major-league pitcher,
you couldn't.

38:15.180 --> 38:16.739
We had better pitching
in the Negro leagues.

38:16.820 --> 38:18.573
I hit seven home runs
off of Satchel Paige.

38:18.660 --> 38:19.889
You can't get no better than that.

38:19.980 --> 38:21.653
Sandy Koufax,
he leading the league in strikeouts.

38:21.740 --> 38:23.254
I ain't thinking
about no Sandy Koufax.

38:23.340 --> 38:25.093
You got Warren Spahn and
Lew Burdette. I bet you...

38:25.180 --> 38:26.409
I'm through with it now.

38:30.660 --> 38:33.050
Go and cut them boards.

38:35.180 --> 38:38.457
Your mama told me you got recruited
by a college football team.

38:38.540 --> 38:39.860
Is that right?

38:40.060 --> 38:41.663
Yeah, Coach Zellman
say the recruiter

38:41.733 --> 38:43.292
gonna be coming
by to talk to you.

38:43.380 --> 38:45.417
Get you to sign the
permission papers.

38:45.540 --> 38:47.099
I thought you was supposed
to be working down the A&P.

38:47.180 --> 38:48.819
Ain't you supposed to be
working down there after school?

38:48.900 --> 38:50.653
Mr. Stawicki say he
gonna hold my job for me

38:50.740 --> 38:52.140
until after the football season.

38:52.420 --> 38:54.810
He said starting next week,
I can work weekends.

38:54.900 --> 38:55.081
Boy,

38:55.151 --> 38:57.813
I thought we had an understanding
about this football stuff.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.619
You supposed to keep
up with your chores,

38:59.700 --> 39:01.498
hold your job down
there at the A&P.

39:01.580 --> 39:03.776
You ain't been around here
all day on a Saturday,

39:03.860 --> 39:05.135
ain't none of your chores done.

39:05.220 --> 39:06.893
Now you come telling me
you done quit your job?

39:07.020 --> 39:09.057
- I'm gonna be working weekends.
- You damn right you are!

39:09.140 --> 39:10.972
And ain't no need for nobody
to be coming around here,

39:11.060 --> 39:12.210
talking to me about signing nothing.

39:12.300 --> 39:13.336
Pop, you can't do that.

39:13.420 --> 39:14.695
He's coming all the way
from North Carolina.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.652
I don't care where he coming from!

39:16.780 --> 39:17.930
Look, boy,

39:19.060 --> 39:20.460
the white man ain't gonna let you

39:20.540 --> 39:22.338
get nowhere with no football no way.

39:22.740 --> 39:24.936
Now you get your book-learning,
so you can

39:25.060 --> 39:27.973
work your way up at the A&P
and learn how to fix cars,

39:28.060 --> 39:29.733
or build houses, get you a trade.

39:29.820 --> 39:32.335
This way, you got something
can't nobody take away from you.

39:32.460 --> 39:34.850
You go in and learn how to
put your hands to good use

39:34.940 --> 39:36.818
besides hauling other
people's garbage.

39:36.900 --> 39:37.970
I get good grades, Pop.

39:38.060 --> 39:39.414
That's why the recruiter
want to talk with you.

39:39.500 --> 39:41.059
You got to keep up your
grades to get recruited.

39:41.140 --> 39:42.972
This way, I'll be going to college,
I'll get a chance.

39:43.060 --> 39:46.531
First, you get your butt down
there and get your job back.

39:46.620 --> 39:48.054
Mr. Stawicki done already
hired somebody else

39:48.140 --> 39:49.574
'cause I told him I
was playing football.

39:51.220 --> 39:53.052
You a bigger fool than I thought.

39:53.140 --> 39:55.132
You gonna let somebody
take away your job,

39:55.220 --> 39:56.540
so you can play some football.

39:57.100 --> 39:58.222
Where you gonna get your money

39:58.292 --> 39:59.900
to take care of your
girlfriend and whatnot?

39:59.980 --> 40:01.334
What kind of foolishness is that

40:01.420 --> 40:02.854
to let somebody take away your job?

40:02.940 --> 40:04.169
I'm still gonna be
working weekends.

40:04.260 --> 40:06.331
No. You getting out of here
and finding you another job.

40:06.420 --> 40:07.695
Come on, Pop. I gotta practice.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.533
I can't work after school
and play football, too.

40:09.620 --> 40:11.179
The team needs me,
that's what Coach Zellman say.

40:11.260 --> 40:13.411
I don't care what nobody say.
I'm the boss. You understand?

40:13.500 --> 40:16.732
I'm the boss around here.
I do the only saying what counts.

40:16.820 --> 40:19.210
- Come on...
- I asked you, "Do you understand?"

40:19.340 --> 40:22.219
- Yeah.
- What?

40:22.300 --> 40:25.452
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

40:25.540 --> 40:26.935
You get on down
there to that A&P

40:27.005 --> 40:28.570
and see if you can
get your job back.

40:28.660 --> 40:31.220
If you can't do both,
then you quit the football team.

40:31.300 --> 40:33.417
You got to take the
crookeds with the straights.

40:33.500 --> 40:34.695
Yes, sir.

40:42.300 --> 40:45.372
- Can I ask you a question?
- What the hell you got to ask me?

40:45.460 --> 40:48.259
Mr. Stawicki the one you
got the questions for.

40:48.340 --> 40:49.820
How come you ain't never liked me?

40:51.020 --> 40:55.253
Like you?
Who the hell said I got to like you?

40:56.740 --> 40:58.891
What law is there say
I got to like you?

40:58.980 --> 41:00.413
You want to stand up
in front of my face

41:00.483 --> 41:02.099
and ask a damn fool-ass
question like that.

41:02.180 --> 41:03.455
Talk about liking somebody.

41:03.540 --> 41:04.860
Come here, boy, when I talk to you.

41:07.220 --> 41:11.499
Straighten up, God damn it!
I asked you a question.

41:11.780 --> 41:14.079
What law is there
say I got to like you?

41:14.149 --> 41:14.739
None.

41:14.820 --> 41:16.812
All right, then.
Don't you eat every day?

41:18.180 --> 41:19.614
Answer me when I talk to you.

41:19.700 --> 41:20.736
- Don't you eat every day?
- Yeah.

41:20.860 --> 41:22.533
Nigger, as long as you in my house,

41:22.620 --> 41:24.612
you put a "sir" on the end
of it when you talk to me.

41:24.740 --> 41:26.094
- Yes, sir.
- You eat every day?

41:26.180 --> 41:27.500
- Got a roof over your head?
- Yes, sir.

41:27.580 --> 41:28.775
- Got clothes on your back?
- Yes, sir.

41:28.860 --> 41:30.340
- Why you think that is?
- 'Cause of you.

41:31.060 --> 41:35.020
Hell, I know it's 'cause of me.
But why do you think that is?

41:36.700 --> 41:38.020
'Cause you like me?

41:38.220 --> 41:40.132
"Like" you.

41:40.220 --> 41:42.098
I go out of here every morning,

41:42.180 --> 41:45.491
I bust my butt putting up
with them crackers every day

41:45.580 --> 41:47.299
'cause I "like" you.

41:47.380 --> 41:50.418
You about the biggest fool
I ever saw. It's my job.

41:50.500 --> 41:52.332
It's my responsibility.

41:52.420 --> 41:55.219
A man is supposed to
take care of his family.

41:55.420 --> 41:58.299
You live in my house,
fill your belly with my food,

41:58.380 --> 42:01.976
put your behind on my bed
because you're my son.

42:02.060 --> 42:04.859
Not 'cause I like you. 'Cause
it's my duty to take care of you.

42:04.940 --> 42:07.500
I owe a responsibility to you.

42:07.580 --> 42:09.458
Now, let's get this
straight right here and now,

42:09.540 --> 42:11.099
before it go along any further.

42:11.180 --> 42:12.660
I ain't got to like you.

42:12.740 --> 42:15.858
Mr. Rand don't give me my money
come payday 'cause he like me.

42:15.940 --> 42:18.978
He give it to me 'cause he owe me.

42:19.460 --> 42:21.099
Now I done give you
everything I got to give you.

42:21.180 --> 42:23.490
I give you your life!

42:23.580 --> 42:25.060
Me and your mama worked
that out between us,

42:25.140 --> 42:28.258
and liking your black ass
wasn't part of the bargain.

42:28.460 --> 42:29.860
Now don't you go through life

42:29.940 --> 42:32.171
worrying about whether
somebody like you, or not.

42:32.260 --> 42:35.332
You best be making sure
they're doing right by you.

42:35.420 --> 42:37.059
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Yes, sir.

42:37.140 --> 42:40.577
Then get the hell out of my face
and get on down to that A&P!

43:03.940 --> 43:06.375
Why don't you go ahead and let
the boy play football, Troy?

43:06.460 --> 43:08.372
He just want to be like
you with the sports.

43:08.460 --> 43:10.531
I don't want him to be like me.

43:10.620 --> 43:12.213
I want him to get as
far away from my life

43:12.300 --> 43:13.370
as he possibly can get.

43:13.460 --> 43:15.611
You the only decent thing
ever happened to me, Rose.

43:16.140 --> 43:17.574
And I wish him that.

43:18.140 --> 43:21.292
But I don't wish him
nothing else from my life.

43:22.300 --> 43:23.563
I decided 17 years ago,

43:23.633 --> 43:26.214
that boy wasn't gonna get
involved in no sports.

43:26.300 --> 43:27.939
Not after what they did
to me in the sports.

43:28.020 --> 43:30.251
Why don't you just admit you were
too old for the major leagues?

43:30.340 --> 43:31.933
For once,
why don't you just admit that?

43:32.020 --> 43:33.693
Don't you come tellin'
me I was too old.

43:33.780 --> 43:37.012
I just wasn't the right color.
Hell, I'm 53 years old,

43:37.140 --> 43:40.212
I can do better than
Selkirk's .269 right now.

43:40.300 --> 43:42.656
How were you gonna play
ball when you were over 40?

43:42.740 --> 43:44.413
Sometimes,
I can't get no sense out of you.

43:44.500 --> 43:45.570
I got good sense, woman.

43:45.660 --> 43:48.892
I got sense enough not to let that
boy get hurt playing no sports.

43:48.980 --> 43:50.494
You mothering the boy too much.

43:50.620 --> 43:52.737
Worrying about whether people
"like" him or not.

43:52.820 --> 43:56.097
Everything that boy do,
he do for you.

43:56.180 --> 43:58.048
He wants you to say,
"Good job, son."

43:58.118 --> 43:58.740
That's all.

43:59.180 --> 44:02.298
I ain't got time for that, Rose.
He's alive, he's healthy.

44:02.380 --> 44:05.737
He's got to make his own way.
I made mine.

44:05.860 --> 44:08.375
Ain't nobody gonna hold his hand
when he get out there in the world.

44:08.460 --> 44:10.816
Times have changed, Troy.

44:10.900 --> 44:12.971
People change.

44:13.060 --> 44:15.336
The world changing,
and you can't even see it.

44:21.860 --> 44:24.614
Woman, I do the best I can do.

44:24.700 --> 44:26.020
I come in here every Friday,

44:26.100 --> 44:28.934
I carry a sack of potatoes
and a bucket of lard.

44:29.020 --> 44:32.616
You all line up at the
door with your hands out.

44:32.700 --> 44:36.296
I give you the lint from my pockets.
I give you my sweat and my blood.

44:36.380 --> 44:38.975
I ain't got no tears.
I done spent them.

44:39.100 --> 44:41.695
We go upstairs in that room
at night, I fall down on you

44:41.780 --> 44:45.296
and try to blast a
hole into forever.

44:45.380 --> 44:47.611
I get up Monday morning,
find my lunch on the table,

44:47.700 --> 44:49.100
go out and make my way.

44:49.180 --> 44:53.459
Find my strength to get
me through to next Friday.

44:53.540 --> 44:54.940
That's all I got, Rose.

44:58.060 --> 45:00.859
That's all I got to give.

45:05.060 --> 45:06.574
Can't give nothing else!

45:33.500 --> 45:34.775
Mr. Maxson?

45:37.700 --> 45:39.896
Commissioner will see you now.

45:46.700 --> 45:48.054
Rose!

45:51.020 --> 45:52.613
Hey, Ro!

45:52.700 --> 45:57.092
I wish I could've seen Mr.
Rand's face when he told you.

45:57.220 --> 45:59.974
He couldn't get it out his mouth.
Liked to bit his tongue.

46:00.060 --> 46:01.972
When they called me down there
to the Commissioner's office,

46:02.100 --> 46:04.854
he thought they was gonna fire me,
like everybody else.

46:04.940 --> 46:06.579
I didn't think they
was gonna fire you.

46:06.660 --> 46:09.129
I thought they's gonna put
you on the warning paper.

46:09.220 --> 46:12.531
Hey, Rose! Yeah,
Mr. Rand liked to bit his tongue.

46:12.620 --> 46:14.657
I see you run right
down there to Taylors'

46:14.780 --> 46:16.055
and told that Alberta gal.

46:16.140 --> 46:19.212
Hey, Rose!
I told everybody. Hey, Ro!

46:19.300 --> 46:21.212
I went down there to cash my check.

46:22.100 --> 46:23.136
Hey!

46:23.220 --> 46:25.018
Hush all that hollering.
I know you out here.

46:25.100 --> 46:26.898
What they say down at the
Commissioner's office?

46:26.980 --> 46:28.778
You supposed to come
when I call you, woman.

46:28.860 --> 46:30.010
Bono will tell you that.

46:30.100 --> 46:31.614
Don't Lucille come
when you call her?

46:31.700 --> 46:32.816
Man, hush your mouth.
I ain't no dog.

46:32.900 --> 46:34.220
Talk about come when you call me.

46:34.340 --> 46:35.854
You hear this, Bono?
I used to have me an old dog

46:35.940 --> 46:37.010
get uppity like that.

46:37.100 --> 46:39.660
You say, "Come here, Blue,"
he just lay there, look at you.

46:39.740 --> 46:41.971
End up getting a stick chasin'
him away, trying to make him come.

46:42.100 --> 46:43.580
I ain't studying you and your dog.

46:43.660 --> 46:45.253
I remember you used
to sing that old song.

46:45.500 --> 46:47.651
<i>Hear it ring! Hear it ring!</i>

46:47.860 --> 46:49.533
<i>Had an old dog, his name was Blue</i>

46:49.620 --> 46:51.134
Nobody wants to hear that old song.

46:52.100 --> 46:53.853
<i>You know Blue was mighty true</i>

46:53.940 --> 46:56.011
Used to have Cory runnin'
around here singin' that song.

46:56.100 --> 46:57.773
Hell, I remember that song myself.

46:57.860 --> 47:00.216
<i>You know Blue was a good old dog</i>

47:00.420 --> 47:02.616
<i>Blue treed a possum in a hollow log</i>

47:02.780 --> 47:05.295
That's my daddy's song.
My daddy made up that song.

47:05.380 --> 47:07.940
I don't care who made it up. Don't
nobody want to hear you sing it.

47:08.260 --> 47:09.614
<i>Come here, woman!</i>

47:09.940 --> 47:13.411
You come in here carrying on,
I reckon they ain't fired you.

47:13.500 --> 47:15.457
What they say down there at
the Commissioner's office?

47:15.540 --> 47:18.578
Look here, Rose.
Mr. Rand called me in his office

47:18.660 --> 47:21.175
after I got back from talkin'
to them people down there.

47:21.260 --> 47:23.570
He called me in his
office and told me...

47:25.300 --> 47:26.700
They was making me a driver!

47:27.300 --> 47:30.213
- Troy, you kidding!
- No, I ain't. Ask Bono.

47:30.300 --> 47:32.934
That's great, Troy. Now you don't
have to hassle them people no more.

47:33.020 --> 47:36.138
Oh, hell. I didn't think
I was gonna see you today.

47:36.220 --> 47:37.700
I thought you was in jail.

47:37.820 --> 47:40.130
Got it all over the <i>Courier</i>
about them raiding Seefus' place

47:40.220 --> 47:42.735
where you be hanging
out with all them thugs.

47:42.820 --> 47:44.459
Hey, Pop, that ain't got
nothing to do with me.

47:44.660 --> 47:45.855
I don't go down there gambling.

47:45.940 --> 47:47.818
I just go down there to
sit in with the band.

47:47.900 --> 47:49.971
I ain't got nothing to do
with the gambling part.

47:50.060 --> 47:51.574
They got some good music down there.

47:51.660 --> 47:53.413
They got some rogues
is what they got.

47:53.500 --> 47:55.492
How you been, Mr. Bono? Hi, Rose.

47:55.580 --> 47:58.220
I see where you playing down
at the Crawford Grill tonight.

47:58.340 --> 47:59.820
How come you ain't brought
Bonnie like I told you?

47:59.900 --> 48:00.890
You shoulda brought Bonnie.

48:00.980 --> 48:02.300
She ain't been by in
a month of Sundays.

48:02.380 --> 48:03.575
I was just in the neighborhood.

48:03.660 --> 48:05.060
- Thought I'd stop by.
- Here it comes.

48:05.180 --> 48:07.376
Your daddy got a
promotion on the rubbish.

48:07.460 --> 48:09.770
He gonna be the
first colored driver.

48:09.860 --> 48:11.140
Ain't got to do nothin'
but sit up there

48:11.210 --> 48:12.654
and read the paper,
like them white fellas.

48:12.740 --> 48:15.460
Hey, Pop, if you knew how to read,
you'd be all right.

48:15.540 --> 48:18.055
Nah, nah. You mean if the
nigger knew how to drive,

48:18.140 --> 48:19.256
he'd be all right.

48:19.500 --> 48:21.457
Been fighting with them
people about driving

48:21.527 --> 48:22.893
and ain't even got a license.

48:22.980 --> 48:24.699
Mr. Rand know you ain't
got no driver's license?

48:24.780 --> 48:25.770
Driving ain't nothing.

48:25.860 --> 48:27.613
All you do is point the truck
where you want it to go.

48:27.700 --> 48:28.770
Driving ain't nothing.

48:28.860 --> 48:30.374
Do they know you ain't
got no driver's license?

48:30.500 --> 48:31.570
That's what I'm talkin' about.

48:31.660 --> 48:33.014
I ain't asked if driving was easy.

48:33.100 --> 48:35.456
I asked if Mr. Rand know you
ain't got no driver's license.

48:35.540 --> 48:36.610
The man ain't got
to know my business.

48:36.700 --> 48:38.851
Time he find out, I have two or
three of them driver's license.

48:38.940 --> 48:40.818
- Say, look here, Pop.
- I knew it was coming.

48:40.900 --> 48:42.812
I knew what kinda "Look here,
Pop" that was.

48:42.900 --> 48:44.220
Nigger finna ask me for some money.

48:44.460 --> 48:46.179
It's Friday night, it's my payday.

48:46.260 --> 48:49.776
All them rogues down on the avenue,
the ones that ain't in jail,

48:49.860 --> 48:52.580
and Lyons is hopping in his shoes
to get down there with them.

48:52.660 --> 48:53.696
Now, see, Pop,

48:53.780 --> 48:56.295
if you gave somebody else
a chance to talk sometime,

48:56.380 --> 48:59.976
you'd see I was fixing to pay you
back your $10 like I told you.

49:00.060 --> 49:03.212
Here. I told you I'd pay
you when Bonnie got paid.

49:03.300 --> 49:05.496
No, you keep that $10.
Put it in the bank.

49:05.580 --> 49:07.173
Next time you feel like
you wanna come by here

49:07.260 --> 49:08.899
and ask me for somethin',
you go down there and get that.

49:09.220 --> 49:10.449
Here you go your $10, Pop.

49:10.580 --> 49:12.333
I told you,
I don't want you to give me nothing.

49:12.420 --> 49:13.649
I just wanted to borrow $10.

49:13.740 --> 49:16.300
No, you keep that for the
next time you want to ask me.

49:16.580 --> 49:17.900
Come on, Pop, here go your $10.

49:17.980 --> 49:21.052
Troy, why don't you let
the boy pay you back?

49:23.900 --> 49:26.460
Here you go, Rose.
If you don't take it,

49:26.540 --> 49:28.497
I'm gonna hear about it
for the next six months.

49:28.580 --> 49:30.219
You can hand yours over, too, Troy.

49:30.300 --> 49:31.814
You see this, Bono?
You see how they do me?

49:31.900 --> 49:33.653
Yeah, Lucille do me the same way.

49:33.780 --> 49:37.091
<i>Better get ready for the Judgment</i>

49:38.580 --> 49:40.139
<i>Better get ready</i>

49:42.940 --> 49:44.932
Hey. Hey, there's Troy's boy!

49:45.020 --> 49:46.340
How you doing, Uncle Gabe?

49:46.420 --> 49:47.900
Lyons!

49:49.860 --> 49:52.216
The King of the Jungle!

49:52.620 --> 49:55.499
Rose.
Hey, Rose, I got a flower for you.

49:55.580 --> 49:58.015
I picked it myself.
That's the same rose like you is.

49:58.100 --> 49:59.773
That's right nice of you, Gabe.

49:59.860 --> 50:01.374
What you been doing, Uncle Gabe?

50:01.460 --> 50:04.931
I been chasing hellhounds
and waiting for the time

50:05.020 --> 50:06.852
to tell Saint Peter
to open the Gates.

50:06.940 --> 50:08.613
You been chasing hellhounds, huh?

50:08.700 --> 50:10.419
Well, you doing the right thing,
Uncle Gabe.

50:10.500 --> 50:13.493
- Somebody's got to chase 'em.
- Yeah, I know it.

50:13.580 --> 50:16.459
The devil's strong.
The devil ain't no pushover.

50:16.540 --> 50:18.975
Hellhounds snipping
at everybody's heels.

50:19.060 --> 50:21.655
But I got my trumpet waiting
on the Judgment time.

50:21.740 --> 50:23.459
Waiting on the Battle of Armageddon,
huh?

50:23.540 --> 50:25.611
Ain't gonna be too much of a battle

50:25.740 --> 50:29.177
when God get to waving
that Judgment sword.

50:29.260 --> 50:31.331
But the people's gonna
have a hell of a time

50:31.420 --> 50:33.980
trying to get into Heaven
if them Gates ain't open.

50:34.060 --> 50:35.574
You hear this, Pop?

50:36.140 --> 50:38.336
- Uncle Gabe, you all right.
- Lyons.

50:41.460 --> 50:43.895
- The King of the Jungle!
- You stayin' for supper, Gabe?

50:43.980 --> 50:45.050
You want me to fix you a plate?

50:45.140 --> 50:48.053
I'll just take a sandwich, Rose.
I don't want no plate.

50:48.140 --> 50:50.257
I want to eat with my hands.
I'll take a sandwich.

50:50.340 --> 50:52.730
What about you, Lyons? You stayin'?
Got some short ribs cooking.

50:52.820 --> 50:56.291
Nah. I won't eat nothing
till after we finish playing.

50:56.940 --> 50:58.932
You ought to come down,
listen to me play, Pop.

50:59.020 --> 51:01.296
I don't like all that Chinese music,
all that noise.

51:01.380 --> 51:04.851
Go in there and wash up, Gabe.
I'll fix you a sandwich.

51:04.940 --> 51:07.580
Troy mad at me.

51:07.660 --> 51:09.014
What you mad at Uncle Gabe for?

51:09.100 --> 51:11.934
He think Troy mad at him 'cause he
moved over there to Miss Pearl's.

51:12.020 --> 51:14.091
I ain't mad at the man.
He can live where he want to live at.

51:14.180 --> 51:16.331
Well, what he move over there for?
Miss Pearl don't like nobody.

51:16.420 --> 51:18.173
She don't mind him none.
She treat him real nice.

51:18.260 --> 51:19.740
She just don't allow
all that singing.

51:19.820 --> 51:22.380
She don't mind that rent he be
paying. That's what she don't mind.

51:22.460 --> 51:23.974
Troy, I ain't goin'
through that with you no more.

51:24.060 --> 51:25.858
He moved over there
'cause he wanted his own place.

51:25.940 --> 51:27.010
He can come and go as he please.

51:27.100 --> 51:28.349
He can come and go
as he please here.

51:28.419 --> 51:29.217
I wasn't stoppin' him.

51:29.300 --> 51:30.529
I wasn't putting no
rules on the man.

51:30.620 --> 51:32.373
That ain't the same thing,
and you know it.

51:32.460 --> 51:33.689
Now that's the last I
wanna hear about that.

51:33.780 --> 51:35.931
I don't wanna hear nothin'
else about Gabe and Miss Pearl.

51:36.060 --> 51:38.700
- And next week...
- I'm ready for my sandwich, Rose.

51:38.780 --> 51:40.931
And next week, when that
recruiter come from that school,

51:41.020 --> 51:43.694
I want you to sign that paper and
go on and let Cory play football.

51:43.780 --> 51:45.499
That'll be the last I
have to hear about that.

51:50.180 --> 51:52.172
Cory got recruited?
What school he goin' to?

51:52.300 --> 51:53.893
I ain't thinking about Cory nothing.

51:53.980 --> 51:55.805
Boy walking around here
smelling his piss,

51:55.875 --> 51:57.700
thinking he gonna do
what he want to do,

51:57.780 --> 52:00.056
irregardless of what I say.

52:00.140 --> 52:02.416
Look here, Bono,
I left the Commissioner's office

52:02.500 --> 52:03.900
and went down to the A&P.

52:03.980 --> 52:06.176
That boy ain't workin' down there,
he lied to me.

52:06.260 --> 52:09.617
Tellin' me he got his job back,
tellin' me he workin' weekend,

52:09.700 --> 52:11.259
tellin' me he workin' after school.

52:11.340 --> 52:13.571
Mr. Stawicki says he ain't
working down there at all.

52:13.660 --> 52:14.855
Cory just growing up.

52:14.940 --> 52:16.977
He just bustin' at the seams,
tryin' to fill out your shoes.

52:17.100 --> 52:18.250
I don't care what he doing.

52:18.340 --> 52:20.411
When he get to the place
where he want to disobey me,

52:20.500 --> 52:23.652
then it's time for him to move on.
Bono will tell you that.

52:23.740 --> 52:25.693
I bet he ain't never
disobeyed his daddy

52:25.763 --> 52:27.416
without paying the consequences.

52:27.500 --> 52:29.776
I ain't never had the chance.

52:29.860 --> 52:33.456
My daddy came on through, but I
ain't never knew him to see him.

52:33.540 --> 52:36.135
Or what he had on his mind,
or where he went.

52:36.220 --> 52:39.896
Just moving on through.
Searching out the New Land.

52:40.780 --> 52:43.090
That's what the old
folks used to call it.

52:43.180 --> 52:46.617
See a fella moving around from
place to place, woman to woman,

52:46.700 --> 52:49.090
they call it
"Searching out the New Land."

52:49.180 --> 52:50.819
I can't say if he ever found it.

52:51.580 --> 52:54.049
I come along, didn't want no kids.

52:54.540 --> 52:56.532
I didn't know if I was gonna
be in one place long enough

52:56.620 --> 52:58.612
to fix on 'em right as their daddy.

52:58.700 --> 53:00.817
I figured I was going searching,
too.

53:00.900 --> 53:03.131
As it turn out,
I been hooked up with Lucille

53:03.220 --> 53:05.610
for near about as long as
your daddy been with Rose.

53:05.700 --> 53:07.851
Going on 16 years.

53:07.940 --> 53:09.818
Sometimes,
I wish I'd never known my daddy.

53:09.900 --> 53:11.941
He ain't cared
nothing about no kids.

53:12.011 --> 53:13.655
A kid to him wasn't nothing.

53:14.060 --> 53:17.212
All he wanted you to do
was learn how to walk,

53:17.300 --> 53:18.973
so he could start you to working.

53:19.060 --> 53:20.609
Come to eating, he ate first.

53:20.679 --> 53:22.815
Anything left over,
that's what you got.

53:22.900 --> 53:24.732
Man would sit down,
eat two chickens,

53:24.802 --> 53:25.972
and give you the wing.

53:26.060 --> 53:29.337
You ought to stop that, Pop.
Everybody feed their kids.

53:29.420 --> 53:32.538
No matter how hard times is,
everybody care about their kids.

53:32.620 --> 53:33.815
Make sure they have
something to eat.

53:33.900 --> 53:35.653
Only thing my daddy cared about

53:35.740 --> 53:37.493
was getting them bales of
cotton in to Mr. Lubin.

53:37.580 --> 53:39.617
That's the only thing
that mattered to him.

53:39.700 --> 53:41.851
Sometimes, I used to wonder
why he was still living,

53:41.940 --> 53:44.500
why the devil hadn't
come and got him.

53:44.740 --> 53:46.652
"Get them bales of
cotton in to Mr. Lubin."

53:46.740 --> 53:48.094
Find out he owe him money.

53:48.180 --> 53:50.376
He should have just went on and left
when he saw he couldn't get nowhere.

53:50.460 --> 53:51.496
That's what I would've done.

53:51.580 --> 53:54.493
How he gonna leave with 11 kids?
And where he gonna go?

53:54.580 --> 53:57.778
He ain't knew nothing but how
to farm. No, he was trapped.

53:58.180 --> 54:01.332
I think he knew it, too.
But I'll say this for him...

54:01.420 --> 54:03.173
He felt a responsibility toward us.

54:03.260 --> 54:05.252
May not have treated us
like I felt he should have,

54:05.340 --> 54:09.254
but without that responsibility,
he could have run off and left us,

54:09.380 --> 54:10.700
made his own way.

54:10.780 --> 54:12.180
A lot of them did.

54:12.260 --> 54:13.853
Back in those days,
what you talkin' about?

54:13.940 --> 54:15.579
They walk out their front door

54:15.660 --> 54:18.858
and take off down one road or
another and just keep on walkin'.

54:18.940 --> 54:20.852
There you go.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

54:20.940 --> 54:24.297
Just keep on walking till
they come to something else.

54:24.380 --> 54:27.691
Ain't you never heard of nobody
having the walking blues?

54:27.780 --> 54:30.249
Now, that's what you call it
when you just take off like that.

54:30.900 --> 54:34.211
My daddy ain't had no walking blues.
What you talking about?

54:34.300 --> 54:35.780
He stayed right there
with his family,

54:36.620 --> 54:40.534
but he was just as
evil as he could be!

54:40.660 --> 54:44.290
My mama couldn't stand him.
Couldn't stand that evilness.

54:44.380 --> 54:47.373
She run off when I was about eight.

54:47.500 --> 54:50.618
She sneaked off one night,
told me she was coming back for me.

54:50.700 --> 54:52.419
I ain't never seen her no more.

54:52.500 --> 54:56.619
All his women run off and left him.
He wasn't good for nobody.

54:57.140 --> 54:58.813
My turn come to head out.

54:58.900 --> 55:00.254
I was 14,

55:00.340 --> 55:03.219
got to sniffing around
Joe Canewell's daughter.

55:04.580 --> 55:06.890
We had this old mule called
"Greyboy".

55:07.020 --> 55:09.137
My daddy sent me out
to do some plowing.

55:09.220 --> 55:12.896
I got to fooling around with
Joe Canewell's daughter.

55:12.980 --> 55:16.178
Found us a nice spot,
got real cozy with each other.

55:16.260 --> 55:19.458
She was about 13,
so we done figured we grown anyway.

55:19.540 --> 55:21.930
So, we were down there by the creek,
enjoying ourselves,

55:22.020 --> 55:23.420
ain't thinking about nothing.

55:23.500 --> 55:25.810
Didn't know Greyboy
had gotten loose,

55:25.900 --> 55:29.337
wandered back to the house,
and my daddy was lookin' for me.

55:29.620 --> 55:33.091
So, we down there enjoying
ourselves when he come up on us.

55:33.180 --> 55:35.251
Surprised us.

55:35.380 --> 55:37.895
Had them leather
straps off that mule,

55:37.980 --> 55:41.018
commenced to whupping me
like there was no tomorrow.

55:41.100 --> 55:43.695
I jump up. I'm mad, embarrassed.

55:44.380 --> 55:46.497
I was scared of my daddy.

55:46.700 --> 55:48.692
Now,
when he commenced to whipping on me,

55:48.780 --> 55:50.499
quite naturally,
I run to get out of the way.

55:50.580 --> 55:53.254
Now, I think he's mad
'cause I ain't done my work.

55:53.340 --> 55:57.971
But I see where he's chasing me off,
so he can have the gal for himself.

55:59.380 --> 56:01.497
When I see what the
matter of it was,

56:02.380 --> 56:06.659
I lost all fear of my daddy,
and right there, I became a man.

56:06.740 --> 56:09.130
Fourteen years of age.

56:09.220 --> 56:12.133
Now, it's my turn to run him off.

56:12.220 --> 56:14.018
I picked up them same
reins he used on me.

56:14.100 --> 56:17.696
I picked up them reins,
I commenced to whupping on him.

56:18.740 --> 56:21.050
Gal jump up, she run off.

56:22.980 --> 56:24.209
When he turned to face me,

56:24.300 --> 56:26.178
I knew why the devil
never come and get him

56:26.260 --> 56:28.411
'cause he was the devil himself.

56:29.740 --> 56:32.300
I don't know what happened.

56:32.380 --> 56:35.578
I woke up,
laying there by the creek,

56:35.660 --> 56:39.336
and Blue, this old dog we had,
he was licking my face.

56:39.420 --> 56:42.458
Both my eyes were swoll shut.

56:42.540 --> 56:44.372
I thought I was blind,
I couldn't see nothing.

56:44.460 --> 56:48.170
I just laid there and cried.

56:53.740 --> 56:56.653
And I didn't know
what I was gonna do.

56:56.740 --> 57:01.178
But I knew the time had come for
me to leave my daddy's house.

57:02.460 --> 57:04.770
Suddenly, the world got big, and...

57:07.860 --> 57:10.209
It was a long time before
I could cut it down

57:10.279 --> 57:11.774
to where I could handle it.

57:13.460 --> 57:16.294
Part of that cutting down
was where I got to the place

57:16.380 --> 57:18.372
where I could feel him
kicking in my blood,

57:18.460 --> 57:20.053
and I knew the only
thing that separated us

57:20.140 --> 57:22.257
was a matter of a few years.

57:25.300 --> 57:26.654
What you got there, Uncle Gabe?

57:27.660 --> 57:29.094
I got me a ham sandwich.

57:29.180 --> 57:31.331
Rose gave me a ham sandwich.

57:33.820 --> 57:35.971
I lost touch with
everybody except Gabriel.

57:40.980 --> 57:41.970
But...

57:45.660 --> 57:47.492
I hope he's dead.

57:51.740 --> 57:54.414
I hope he found some peace.

57:54.500 --> 57:56.537
That's a heavy story, Pop.

57:57.940 --> 58:01.729
I didn't know you left
home when you was 14.

58:01.860 --> 58:03.897
Fourteen's kinda young
to be on your own.

58:03.980 --> 58:05.858
I don't know what I would've done.

58:06.620 --> 58:09.419
Well, I got up from that creek,
walked on down to Mobile.

58:09.500 --> 58:13.176
I was through with farming. I
figured I'd do better in the cities.

58:13.260 --> 58:15.092
So,
I walked the 200 miles to Mobile.

58:15.180 --> 58:18.776
Wait a minute,
you ain't walked no 200 miles, Pop.

58:18.860 --> 58:20.808
Ain't nobody gonna
walk no 200 miles.

58:20.878 --> 58:22.934
You talking about
some walking there!

58:23.020 --> 58:25.774
That's the only way you got
anywhere back in them days.

58:25.860 --> 58:28.694
Shit! Damn if I wouldn't have
hitched a ride with somebody.

58:28.780 --> 58:30.453
Who you gonna hitch it with?

58:30.540 --> 58:32.338
There ain't no cars and
things like they got now.

58:32.420 --> 58:34.059
We talking about 1918.

58:34.140 --> 58:35.699
What you all out here gettin' into?

58:35.780 --> 58:37.976
I'm telling Lyons
how good he got it.

58:38.060 --> 58:39.335
He don't know nothing
about this I'm talking.

58:39.420 --> 58:40.744
Lyons,
that was Bonnie on the phone.

58:40.814 --> 58:42.174
She says you supposed
to pick her up.

58:42.260 --> 58:44.013
Yeah, okay, Rose.

58:44.100 --> 58:46.820
I walked on down to Mobile,

58:46.900 --> 58:50.177
hitched up with some fellows
that was coming up this way.

58:50.260 --> 58:51.899
Got up here and found out,

58:51.980 --> 58:53.494
not only could you not get a job,

58:53.620 --> 58:55.134
you couldn't find no place to live.

58:55.220 --> 58:57.860
I thought I was in freedom.

58:58.140 --> 59:00.530
Colored folks living down
there on the riverbanks

59:00.620 --> 59:02.851
in whatever kind of shelter
they could find for themselves.

59:02.940 --> 59:05.409
Right down there under
the Brady Street Bridge.

59:05.820 --> 59:09.131
Living down there in shacks made
out of sticks and tar paper.

59:10.180 --> 59:11.899
Messed around down there.

59:11.980 --> 59:14.495
Went from bad to worse.
Started stealing.

59:14.580 --> 59:17.175
First, it was food.
Then I figure I steal me some money,

59:17.260 --> 59:19.729
I can buy me some food,
buy me some shoes, too.

59:20.060 --> 59:21.813
One thing led to another.
Met your mama.

59:22.260 --> 59:24.570
I was young, anxious to be a man.

59:25.140 --> 59:27.496
I met your mama and had you.
Why'd I do that for?

59:27.580 --> 59:30.015
Now, I got to worry about
feeding you and her.

59:30.100 --> 59:31.580
Got to steal three times as much.

59:32.420 --> 59:35.811
I went out one day looking
for somebody to rob.

59:35.940 --> 59:37.215
That's what I was, I was a robber.

59:37.940 --> 59:39.533
I'mma tell you the truth.

59:39.620 --> 59:41.532
I'm ashamed of it today,
but it's the truth.

59:42.580 --> 59:44.458
I went to rob this fella,
I pull out my knife.

59:44.540 --> 59:46.691
He pulled out a gun,
shot me in the chest.

59:46.780 --> 59:50.012
It felt like somebody had taken a
hot branding iron and laid it on me.

59:50.100 --> 59:53.138
Now, when he shot me,
I jumped at him with my knife,

59:55.020 --> 59:56.852
and they say I killed him.

59:56.940 --> 59:59.011
Locked me up, put me in the
penitentiary for 15 years.

59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.454
That's where I met Bono.

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:03.296
Where I learned how
to play baseball.

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:04.894
Got out that place,
and your mama had taken you,

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.972
went on to make a life without me.

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:09.131
Fifteen years was a long
time for her to wait.

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:11.098
But that 15 years cured
me of that robbing stuff.

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:12.534
Rose'll tell you.

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:14.896
I first met her, she ask me if I had

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:17.131
gotten all that foolishness
out of my system.

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:19.052
I said, "Baby,
it's you and baseball,

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:20.859
"all what count to me."
You hear me, Bono?

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:23.580
And I meant it, too.
She said, "Which one come first?"

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:26.732
I said, "Well,
ain't no doubt it's baseball.

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:28.777
"But you stick and get old with me,

01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:30.419
"and we'll both
outlive this baseball."

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.617
Am I right, Rose?

01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:34.890
And it's true.

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:36.733
Man, hush your mouth.
You ain't say no such thing.

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:37.623
Talkin' about, "Baby,

01:00:37.693 --> 01:00:39.415
you know you'll always
be number one with me."

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.095
That's what you was talking.

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.649
- That's why I love this woman.
- Rose will keep you straight.

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:46.857
You get off the track,
she'll straighten you up.

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:48.294
Lyons,
you better get on up and get Bonnie.

01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:49.860
She waiting on you.

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:51.215
- Hey, Pop.
- Yeah?

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:53.337
You ought to come down to the Grill,
hear me play.

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:55.699
Man, I ain't goin' down there.

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.214
I'm too old to be hanging
out in them clubs.

01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:00.577
You got to be good to
play down at the Grill.

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.140
Come on, Pop.

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:06.009
- I got to get up in the morning.
- Well, you ain't gotta stay long.

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:10.696
No, I'm gonna eat my
supper and go to bed.

01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:14.614
Well, I got to go.
I'll see you later.

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.416
Don't you come by my
house on my payday!

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:22.891
And pick up the phone,
let somebody know you coming,

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:24.977
and bring Bonnie,
you know I'm always glad to see her.

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:28.531
I'll do that, Rose.
You take care now.

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:30.134
- See you, Pop.
- All right.

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:32.291
See you, Mr. Bono.

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:35.418
- See you, Uncle Gabe!
- Lyons! King of the Jungle!

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:37.855
Supper ready, woman?

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:39.454
Me and you got some
business to take care of.

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.856
- I'mma tear it up, too.
- Troy, I done told you now!

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:44.177
Hell, woman, it's Bono.
Bono like family.

01:01:44.247 --> 01:01:46.093
I done know this nigger since...

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:48.649
- How long have I known you?
- It's been a long time.

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:51.130
I done known this nigger
since Skippy was a pup!

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:53.052
Me and him done been
through some times!

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:54.813
You sure are right about that.

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:56.892
Hell, I known him longer
than I known you, Rose,

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:58.812
and we still standin'
shoulder to shoulder.

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:02.291
Look here, Bono, a man can't
ask for no more than that.

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.609
I love you, nigger.

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:05.657
Hell! I love you, too.

01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:08.733
But I got to get home, see my woman.
You got yours in hand.

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:10.574
I got to go get mine.

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:14.418
What you do that for, Pop?

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.854
What's the matter?
Cory, what's the matter?

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:17.693
Pop done went up to the
school and told Coach Zellman

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:18.930
I can't play football no more.

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.534
Wouldn't even let me play the game.

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:22.140
Told him to tell the
recruiter not to come.

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:24.018
- Troy.
- What you Troying me for?

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:25.693
Yeah, I did it.
And the boy knows why I did it.

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:27.658
Why you wanna do that to me?
That was the one chance I had!

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:29.174
Ain't nothing wrong with
Cory playing football, Troy.

01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:30.410
The boy lied to me.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.015
I told the nigger,
"You want to play football,

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.375
"you keep up with your chores

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:36.975
"hold that job down at the A&P."
That was the conditions.

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:38.540
I stopped down to
see Mr. Stawicki...

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:41.340
I can't work after school
during the football season, Pop.

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:43.571
I tried to tell you Mr. Stawicki
was holding my job for me.

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:44.966
You don't never want
to listen to nobody,

01:02:45.036 --> 01:02:46.375
and then you wanna go
and do this to me?

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:48.019
I ain't done nothin' to you.
You done it to yourself.

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:49.693
Just 'cause you didn't get a chance!

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:51.772
You're just scared I'm gonna
be better than you, that's all!

01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:58.809
- Come here.
- Troy.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:00.490
Troy.

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.820
Pick it up.

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:19.459
Put it on.

01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:29.058
Strap it up.

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:36.014
All right.

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.333
See, you done made a mistake.

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:40.458
I didn't even do nothing!

01:03:40.528 --> 01:03:42.060
I'll tell you what
your mistake was.

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:46.410
You swung at the ball
and you didn't hit it.

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:50.170
That's strike one.
You in the batter's box now.

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:53.380
You swung and you missed, see?

01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:55.849
That's strike one.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:01.813
Don't you strike out.

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:37.774
Cory, why don't you come on in here,
help me clean out these cupboards.

01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:41.217
I ain't quitting the team.
I don't care what Papa says.

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:43.451
I'll talk to him when he get back.

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:45.220
He had to go see
about your Uncle Gabe.

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:46.575
Police done arrested him again.

01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:48.373
Said he was disturbing the peace.

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:49.814
He'll be back directly.

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:52.460
Come on in here and help me
clean out these cupboards.

01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:53.809
Come on.

01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:06.018
Troy, what they say down there?

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.411
They ain't said nothing.
I give them $50, they let him go.

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.378
I'll talk to you about it.

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:12.450
Where Cory?

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.850
He in the house, helping me
clean out these cupboards.

01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:16.812
All right,
tell him to get his butt out here.

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:21.297
All they want is the money.

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:23.576
This makes six, seven times,
I done went down there and got him.

01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:25.891
See me coming,
they stick out their hands.

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:28.734
Yeah, I know what you mean. That's
all they care about, that money.

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:30.891
They don't care about what's right.

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:36.732
Nigger, why you got to
go and get some hardwood?

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:39.096
You ain't doing nothin'
but building a little old fence.

01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:41.092
Get you some soft pinewood.
That's all you need.

01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:42.773
I know what I'm doing.
This outside wood.

01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:45.091
You put pinewood inside the house.

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:48.252
Pinewood inside wood.
This here the outside wood.

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.536
Now tell me,
where the fence gonna be?

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:53.738
You don't need this wood.

01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:55.300
You can put it up with pinewood,

01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:57.656
and it'll stand as long as you
gonna be here looking at it.

01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:59.220
How you know how long I'm
gonna be here, nigger?

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:00.973
Hell, I might live forever.

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.655
I'll live longer
than old man Horsely.

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:05.459
That's what Magee used to say.

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:06.288
Magee a damn fool.

01:07:06.358 --> 01:07:07.896
Now you tell me who
you ever heard of

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:11.018
gonna pull their own teeth
with a pair of rusty pliers?

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:12.216
They're old folks.

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:14.212
My granddaddy used to pull
his teeth with pliers.

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:16.417
They ain't had no dentists
for colored folk back then.

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:19.055
Well, get clean pliers.
You understand? Clean pliers.

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.700
Sterilize them.
Besides, we ain't living back then.

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:24.939
All he had to do was go
down to Doc Goldblum's.

01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:27.580
I see where you and that
Tallahassee gal, that Alberta,

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:30.177
see where you all done got tight.

01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:31.535
What you mean, "got tight"?

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:33.657
I see where you be laughing and
joking with her all the time.

01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:36.460
I laugh and joke with 'em all.
Bono, you know me.

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:38.532
Ain't the kind of laughing
and joking I'm talking about.

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:41.660
How you doing, Mr. Bono?

01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:43.459
Cory, get that saw from
Bono and cut some wood.

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:45.975
He talking about
wood too hard to cut.

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:47.653
Stand back there, Jim.

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:49.009
Let the young boy show
you how it's done.

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:51.251
He's sure welcome to it.

01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:59.893
Look at that. Big, ol' strong boy,
looks like Joe Louis.

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:02.580
Hell, I must be getting old

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:04.617
the way I'm watching that
boy whip through that wood.

01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:07.210
I don't see why Mama wants a
fence around no yard no way.

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:08.376
Damn if I know, either.

01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:10.531
I don't know what the hell
she keeping out with it.

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.612
She ain't got nothing nobody wants.

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:15.738
Some people build fences
to keep people out,

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:18.130
and other people build
fences to keep people in.

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:21.410
Rose wants to hold on to you all.
She loves you.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:25.133
Hell, nigger, I don't need nobody
to tell me my wife loves me.

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:28.691
Cory, go in the house and see
if you can find the other saw.

01:08:28.819 --> 01:08:30.459
Where's it at?

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:33.339
I said find it.
Look for it till you find it.

01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:39.531
What is that supposed to mean?
Want to keep us in?

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:55.216
Troy,

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:59.569
I done known you seem like
damn near my whole life.

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:02.413
You and Rose both. I known both
of you all for a long time.

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.969
I remember when you met Rose.

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:09.019
When you was hitting them
baseball out of the park.

01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:11.611
A lot of them old gals
was after you then.

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.697
You had the pick of the litter.

01:09:13.779 --> 01:09:17.376
When you picked Rose,
I was happy for you.

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:21.651
That's the first time I
knew you had any sense.

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:24.933
I said,
"My man Troy knows what he's doing.

01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:28.171
"I'm gonna follow this nigger,
he might take me somewhere."

01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.617
I been following you, too.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:34.250
I done learned a whole heap of
things about life watching you.

01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:38.971
I done learned how to
tell where the shit lies.

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:41.376
How to tell it from the alfalfa.

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:44.569
You done learned me a lot of things.

01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:47.255
Showed me how to not
make the same mistakes.

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:49.537
To take life as it come along,

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:52.294
keep putting one foot
in front of the other.

01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:55.420
- Rose is a good woman, Troy.
- I know she a good woman.

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.014
I've been married
to her for 18 years.

01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:58.454
What you got on your mind, Bono?

01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:00.930
I just say she's a good woman,
like I say anything.

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:02.340
I ain't got to have
nothing on my mind.

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:03.414
You just say she a good woman

01:10:03.484 --> 01:10:04.856
and leave it hanging
out there like that?

01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:06.010
Why are you telling
me she a good woman?

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:08.934
She loves you, Troy. Rose loves you.

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:10.215
You saying I don't measure up?

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.569
That's what you tryin' to say.

01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:13.379
I don't measure up
'cause I'm seeing this other gal.

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:14.610
I know what you tryin' to say.

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:16.851
I know what Rose means to you, Troy.

01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:19.899
I'm just tryin' to say I
don't want to see you mess up.

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:23.095
Yeah.

01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:29.454
Well, I appreciate that, Bono.

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.328
If you was messing
around on Lucille,

01:10:33.398 --> 01:10:35.176
I'd be telling you the same thing.

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:36.774
That's all I got to say.

01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:40.779
I just say that
'cause I love you both.

01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:43.813
Yeah.

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:47.129
You know me. I wasn't out
there looking for nothing.

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:49.655
You can't find a better
woman than Rose, I know that.

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:52.814
But it seems like this
woman just stuck on to me

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.050
where I can't shake her loose.

01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:56.668
I done wrestled with it and
tried to throw her off,

01:10:56.738 --> 01:10:58.255
but now she stuck on tighter.

01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:00.650
And now she stuck on for good.

01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:01.585
You's in control.

01:11:01.655 --> 01:11:03.494
That's what you tell
me all the time.

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:05.333
You responsible for what you do.

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:07.173
I ain't ducking the
responsibility of it.

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:09.650
As long as it set right in my heart,
then I'm okay.

01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:12.653
'Cause that's all I listen to. It
tell me right and wrong every time.

01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:14.572
And I ain't talking about
doing Rose no bad turn.

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:16.094
I love Rose.

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:17.739
She done carried me a long ways,

01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:19.174
and I love and respect her for that.

01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:20.410
I know you do.

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.617
That's why I don't want
to see you hurt her.

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:25.090
But what you gonna do
when she finds out?

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:27.611
What you got then?

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.100
You try to juggle both of them,

01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:30.933
sooner or later,
you gonna drop one of them.

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:33.216
- That's common sense.
- I know what you're saying, Bono.

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:36.977
I been trying to figure
a way to work it out.

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:39.097
Work it out right, Troy.

01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:41.860
I ain't trying to get all up
between you and Rose's business,

01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:44.136
but work it, so it come out right.

01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:46.451
Hell, I get all between
you and Lucille's business.

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:48.054
And when you gonna buy that woman

01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:49.494
that refrigerator she be wanting?

01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:51.253
And don't tell me you
ain't got no money.

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:52.615
I know who your banker is.

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:55.215
Mellon don't need that money as bad
as Lucille wants that refrigerator.

01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:56.290
I know that.

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.496
- Tell you what I'll do.
- What?

01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.572
When you finish building
this fence for Rose,

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:01.299
I'll buy Lucille that refrigerator.

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:04.259
You done stuck your
foot in your mouth now.

01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:06.973
Hey, nigger, where you going?

01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:08.289
I'm going home.

01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:10.212
I know you don't expect
me to help you now.

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:11.734
I'm protecting my money.

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:15.133
I want to see you put
that fence up by yourself.

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:16.813
That's what I want to see.

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:19.131
You'll be here another
six months without me.

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:20.580
Nigger, you ain't right.

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:22.333
When it come to my money,

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:25.492
I'm right as fireworks
on the Fourth of July.

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:28.732
We gonna see.
You better get out your bank book!

01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:22.851
What they say down there?
What's happening with Gabe?

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:25.899
I went down there and got him out.
Cost me $50.

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:27.414
Said he was disturbing the peace.

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.935
Judge set up a hearing
for him in three weeks

01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:32.615
to show cause why he
shouldn't be recommitted.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.373
What'd you say?
What'd you tell the judge?

01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:36.419
I told him I'd take care of him.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:38.059
It didn't make no sense
to recommit the man.

01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:39.540
He stuck out his big greasy palm,

01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:42.294
told me to give him $50
and take him on home.

01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:44.292
Where's he at now?
Where'd he go off to?

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:46.292
Gone about his business. He don't
need nobody to hold his hand.

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:48.576
Well, I don't know, seem like that
would be the best place for him.

01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:49.650
To put him in a hospital.

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:52.340
I know what you gonna say, but
that's what I think would be best.

01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:54.059
Man had his life ruined
fighting for what?

01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:55.369
Now, they want to take
him and lock him up?

01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:57.770
Let him be free.
Man ain't bothering nobody.

01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:01.693
Everybody got their own way
of looking at it, I guess.

01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:03.049
Come on, get your lunch.

01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:04.733
I got some lima beans and
cornbread in the oven.

01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:05.890
Come on, get somethin' to eat.

01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:07.573
Ain't no sense in you
fretting over Gabe.

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:08.895
Rose, I got something to tell you.

01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:11.107
Wait till I put the
food on the table.

01:14:11.177 --> 01:14:11.854
Rose...

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:15.534
Now,
I don't know how to tell you this.

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:21.497
And I can't explain it none.

01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:24.732
It just sort of grows on you.

01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:27.783
It started off like a little bush,

01:14:27.853 --> 01:14:30.257
next thing you know,
it's a whole forest.

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:33.538
- Troy, what is you talking about?
- I'm talking, woman. Let me talk.

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:35.418
I'm trying to tell you,

01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.935
find a way to tell you that

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:45.330
I'm gonna be a daddy.

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.776
Yeah, I'm gonna be somebody's daddy.

01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:57.094
Troy, you ain't telling me this.
You're gonna be what?

01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:58.500
- You're gonna be somebody's daddy?
- Rose...

01:14:58.580 --> 01:14:59.650
You're telling your wife this?

01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:00.776
Now...

01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:03.091
Hey, Troy! Hey, Rose!

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:05.775
I got to wait 18 years to
hear something like this?

01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:07.089
Hey, Rose.

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:11.376
I got a flower for you.

01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:17.610
That's a rose.
The same rose like you is.

01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:24.054
Thanks, Gabe.

01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:25.540
Troy, you ain't mad at me?

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:27.054
Them bad mens come and put me away.

01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:29.530
- You ain't mad at me?
- No. No, I ain't mad at you.

01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:31.532
Eighteen years,
and you want to come with this?

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:34.300
See what I got?
Got a brand-new quarter.

01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:38.290
Rose, it's just that...

01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:40.576
Ain't nothing you can say, Troy.
Ain't no explaining it.

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:43.300
The fella that give me this
quarter had a whole mess of 'em!

01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:45.889
I'm gonna keep this quarter
till it stops shining.

01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:48.540
Gabe, go on up front now. I got
some watermelon in the Frigidaire.

01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:49.770
Go on. I'll get you a piece.

01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:52.580
Say, Rose, you know,
I was chasing hellhounds,

01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:55.573
and them bad mens come and
get me and take me away.

01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:57.652
Troy helped me.
He come down there and told them

01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:00.653
they better let me go
before he beat them up!

01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:02.015
Yeah, he did!

01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:04.376
Go up front now, Gabe.
I'll get you some watermelon.

01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:05.940
Them bad men is gone now.

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:08.376
Okay.
Rose gonna give me some watermelon,

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:10.929
the kind with the stripes on it.

01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:17.854
Why, Troy?

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:20.849
Why?

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:26.379
After all these years,
you come dragging this in to me now?

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:28.611
It don't make no sense at your age.

01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:33.089
I could've expected this 10,
or 15 years ago, but not now.

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:35.611
Age ain't got nothing to do with it,
Rose.

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:42.977
I done tried to be
everything a wife should be.

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:46.255
Everything a wife could be.

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:47.615
I've been married 18 years,

01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:50.215
and now, I got to live to
see the day you tell me

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:53.816
you been seeing another woman
and done fathered a child by her.

01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:10.974
And you know I never wanted
no half-nothing in my family!

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:15.255
My whole family is half.

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:17.172
Everybody got different
fathers and mothers

01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:18.740
and my two sisters and my brothers.

01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:20.413
You could hardly tell who's who.

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.253
Could never sit down and
talk about Papa and Mama.

01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:24.980
It was always your papa,
your mama, my papa, my mama.

01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:27.575
And I ain't never wanted
that for none of my children!

01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:28.804
And now, you want
to drag your behind

01:17:28.874 --> 01:17:30.176
in here and tell me
something like this!

01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:32.217
Stop it now. You ought to know.
It's time for you to know.

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.019
Well, I don't want to know,
God damn it!

01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:55.090
Rose?

01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:01.611
I just can't make it go away.
It's done now.

01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:05.614
I can't wish the circumstances
of the thing away.

01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:08.375
And you don't want to, either.

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:10.258
Maybe you want to wish
me and my boy away.

01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:11.694
Maybe that's what you want.

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:14.289
Well, you can't wish us away.

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:16.337
I got 18 years of my
life invested in you.

01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:18.457
You ought to have stayed upstairs
in my bed where you belong.

01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:21.135
Now, listen to me.
We can get a handle on this thing.

01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:23.052
We can talk this out,
come to an understanding.

01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:24.369
All of a sudden it's "we."

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:25.729
Where was "we"
at when you were down there,

01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:27.140
rolling around with
some godforsaken woman?

01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:28.400
"We"
should've come to an understanding

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:30.054
before you started making
a damn fool of yourself!

01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:31.434
You're a day late
and a dollar short

01:18:31.504 --> 01:18:33.014
when it comes to an
understanding with me.

01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:38.858
Rose, it's just that she
gives me a different idea.

01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:42.532
A different understanding
about myself.

01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:46.091
I can step out of this house
and get away from the pressures

01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:47.534
and the problems,
be a different man.

01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:49.418
I ain't got to worry about
how I'll get the roof fixed,

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:51.139
or pay the bills, or...

01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:52.540
I can just

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:57.095
be a part of myself I
ain't never been before.

01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.451
What I want to know is...

01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:05.449
What I want to know

01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:08.220
is do you plan to
continue seeing her?

01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:10.610
That's all you can say to me.

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:14.047
I could sit up in
her house and laugh.

01:19:14.117 --> 01:19:15.974
You understand what I'm saying?

01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:18.655
I could laugh out loud,
and it feels good.

01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:20.971
It reaches all the way down
to the bottom of my shoes.

01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:22.255
Rose, I...

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:27.459
I can't give that up.

01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:35.411
Well, maybe you ought to go on
and stay down there with her,

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.173
if she's a better woman than me.

01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:39.013
It ain't about nobody being
a better woman, or nothing.

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:40.420
Rose, you ain't to blame.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:42.776
A man couldn't ask for a
better wife than you've been.

01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:44.340
I'm responsible for it.

01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:45.979
I done locked myself into a pattern,

01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:48.052
trying to take care of you all,
that I forgot about myself.

01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:49.779
Well, what the hell was I there for?

01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:51.419
That was my job,
not somebody else's.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:54.618
Rose, listen to me. I done tried
all my life to live decent.

01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:57.613
To live a clean, hard, useful life.

01:19:57.700 --> 01:20:00.852
I try to be a good husband to you,
in every way I know how.

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:03.136
Maybe I come into the world
backwards, I don't know,

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:06.531
but you're born with two strikes on
you before you come to the plate.

01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:07.736
You got to guard it closely,

01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:10.460
always looking for the
curveball on the inside corner.

01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:12.179
You can't afford a called strike.

01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:13.614
You can't let nothing get past you.

01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:15.817
If you're going down,
you're doing down swinging.

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:18.620
Everything lined up against you!

01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:21.814
What you gonna do?

01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:25.855
I fooled them, Rose. I bunted.

01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:30.135
When I found you and Cory and a
halfway decent job, I was safe.

01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:32.416
Couldn't nothing touch me!

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:33.934
I wasn't gonna strike out no more.

01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:35.420
I wasn't going back
to the penitentiary.

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.856
I wasn't gonna lie in the
street with a bottle of wine.

01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:42.219
I was safe.
I had me a family, a job.

01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:46.094
I wasn't gonna get that last strike.

01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:50.739
I was standing on first base,

01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:52.777
waiting for one of them boys to
knock me in, to bring me home.

01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:54.658
You should have stayed in my bed,
Troy.

01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:56.174
Then I saw the gal,
she firmed up my backbone.

01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:59.219
I got to thinkin' that if I tried,
maybe I could steal second.

01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:00.780
- You understand?
- You should've held me tight.

01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:02.433
You should've grabbed
me and held on.

01:21:02.503 --> 01:21:04.251
I stood on first
base for 18 years,

01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:06.730
and I thought, well,
God damn it, go on for it!

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:09.210
We ain't talking about baseball!

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:11.610
We talking about you going off
and laying up with another woman,

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:12.690
then bringing it home to me.

01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:15.056
That's what we're talking about.
We're not talkin' about no baseball!

01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:16.290
Rose, you're not listening to me.

01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:19.299
I'm trying to explain it to
you the best way I know how.

01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:22.663
It's not easy for me to admit that

01:21:22.733 --> 01:21:25.332
I've been standing in the
same place for 18 years!

01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:27.935
Well, I've been standing with you!

01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:32.060
I've been right here with you, Troy!
I got a life, too.

01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:36.373
I gave 18 years of my life to
stand in the same spot as you!

01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:38.417
Don't you think I ever
wanted other things?

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:40.617
Don't you think I
had dreams and hopes?

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:43.295
What about my life? What about me?

01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:45.970
Don't you think it ever crossed
my mind to want to know other men?

01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:48.060
That I wanted to lay up somewhere

01:21:48.130 --> 01:21:50.373
and forget about my
responsibilities?

01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:52.053
That I wanted someone
to make me laugh,

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:54.177
so I could feel good?

01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:56.331
You're not the only one
who's got wants and needs.

01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:58.372
But I held on to you, Troy.

01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:02.613
I took all my feelings,
my wants and needs and dreams,

01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:04.498
and I buried them inside you.

01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:06.856
I planted a seed and
watched and prayed over it.

01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:09.933
I planted myself inside
you and waited to bloom!

01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:13.855
And it didn't take me no 18 years to
realize the soil was hard and rocky,

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:16.057
and it wasn't never gonna bloom!

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:19.053
But I held on to you, Troy.
I held you tighter.

01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:21.132
You was my husband.

01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:23.860
I owed you everything I had.

01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:26.614
Every part of me I
could find to give you.

01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:30.529
And upstairs in that bedroom,
with the darkness falling in on me,

01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:34.734
I gave everything I had
to try and erase the doubt

01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:37.494
that you wasn't the
finest man in the world.

01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:40.254
And wherever you was going,
I was gonna be there with you,

01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:42.815
because you was my husband.

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:47.253
'Cause that's the only way I
was gonna survive as your wife.

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:50.406
You always talking
about what you give

01:22:50.476 --> 01:22:52.176
and what you don't have to give.

01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:54.579
But you take, too, Troy.

01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:57.300
You take and don't even
know nobody's giving.

01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:58.370
You say I take and don't give.

01:22:58.460 --> 01:22:59.610
Troy, you're hurting me.

01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:00.648
Troy, you're hurting my arm,
let go!

01:23:00.718 --> 01:23:01.612
I gave you everything I got.

01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:02.975
Don't you tell that lie on me.

01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:04.460
- Mama!
- Don't you tell that lie!

01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:06.054
Troy, you're hurting me!

01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:08.014
Troy! Troy!

01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:12.096
All right. That's strike two.

01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:17.139
You stay away from around me, boy.
Don't you strike out.

01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:20.812
You're living with a full count.

01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:26.178
Don't you strike out!

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:48.492
Troy, I want to talk to you.

01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:53.211
All of a sudden?

01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:57.729
After all this time,
you want to talk to me, huh?

01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:00.300
You ain't wanted to
talk to me in months.

01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:01.700
You ain't wanted to
talk to me last night.

01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:03.260
You didn't want no parts of me then.

01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:05.892
What you want to
talk to me about now?

01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:12.499
- Tomorrow's Friday.
- I know what day tomorrow is.

01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:13.730
You think I don't know
tomorrow's Friday?

01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:16.011
My whole life, I ain't done nothing
but look to see Friday coming,

01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:17.420
and you got to tell me it's Friday.

01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:19.014
I want to know if
you're coming home.

01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:22.015
I always come home, Rose.
You know that.

01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:23.454
Ain't never been a
night I ain't come home.

01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:25.219
That ain't what I mean,
and you know it.

01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:28.857
I wanna know if you're coming
straight home after work.

01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:31.899
I figured I'd cash my check,
hang out at Taylors' with the boys.

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:33.096
Maybe play a game of checkers.

01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:35.775
Troy, I can't live like this.
I won't live like this.

01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:37.260
You're living on
borrowed time with me.

01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:39.332
Been going on six months now,
you ain't been coming home.

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:41.457
I come home every night.
Every night of the year.

01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:44.009
That's 365 days.

01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:48.135
I want you to come home
tomorrow after work.

01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:56.816
Rose, I don't mess up my pay.
You know that.

01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:58.778
I take my pay, I give it to you.

01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:02.217
I don't have no money but
what you give me back.

01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:05.452
I just want a little time to myself.

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:06.730
A little time to enjoy life.

01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:08.698
What about me?
When's my time to enjoy life?

01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:10.851
I don't know what to tell you, Rose.
I'm doing the best I can.

01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:11.976
You ain't been comin'
home from work,

01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:13.414
but time enough to change
your clothes and run out.

01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.492
You wanna call that
the best you can do?

01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:20.132
I'm going over to the
hospital to see Alberta.

01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:22.933
She went into the
hospital this afternoon.

01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:26.457
Looks like she might
have the baby early.

01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:29.013
I won't be gone long.

01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:36.406
Well, you ought to know.

01:28:36.476 --> 01:28:38.489
They went over to Miss
Pearl's and got Gabe today.

01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:42.335
She said you told them to
go ahead and lock him up.

01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:46.380
I ain't said no such thing. Whoever
told you that is telling a lie.

01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:48.179
Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing
but telling a big, fat lie.

01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:50.138
She ain't had to tell me.
I read it on the papers.

01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:52.337
- What'd it say, huh?
- It said you told them to take him.

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:54.611
Then they screwed that up,
just like they screw up everything.

01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:55.929
I ain't worried about what
they got on that paper.

01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:57.932
It say the government sends part
of the check to the hospital,

01:28:58.020 --> 01:28:59.090
the other part to you.

01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:00.819
I got nothing to do with that,
if that's the way it works.

01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:02.016
I don't make up the rules...

01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:03.375
You did Gabe just like you did Cory.

01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:04.655
You wouldn't sign
the paper for Cory,

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:06.379
but you signed for Gabe!
You signed that paper!

01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:08.292
I told you I ain't signed nothing,
woman.

01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:09.939
Hell, the only thing I
signed was the release form.

01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:11.050
Hell, I can't read,

01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:12.460
I don't know what they
had on that paper.

01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:14.372
I ain't signed nothing
about sending Gabe away.

01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:16.611
I said send him to the hospital,
you said let him go free.

01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:17.690
Then you went down there

01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:19.254
and you signed him to the
hospital for half his money.

01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:20.363
You went back on yourself, Troy.

01:29:20.433 --> 01:29:21.616
You're gonna have
to answer for that.

01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:23.299
You just been over there
talking to Miss Pearl.

01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:24.608
She just mad 'cause
she ain't gettin'

01:29:24.678 --> 01:29:25.940
Gabe's rent money, that's all it is.

01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:27.454
Troy,
I seen where you signed the paper!

01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:28.656
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:31.414
And what she doing got papers
on my brother for, anyway?

01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:35.176
Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing
but telling a big, fat lie,

01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:37.092
and I'm gonna tell her about it,
too!

01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:45.575
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:47.660
Say...

01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:51.691
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:49.860
Troy.

01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:53.694
Troy.

01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:01.779
That was the hospital.
Alberta had the baby.

01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:05.815
Yeah? What she have? What is it?

01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:08.380
It's a girl.

01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:12.779
I...

01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:18.051
I better get on down
there to see her.

01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:20.890
Troy.

01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:23.894
I got to go see her now, Rose.
That's only right.

01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:32.497
What's the matter?
Baby all right, ain't it?

01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:38.778
Alberta died having the baby.

01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:42.012
She died? You say she's dead?

01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:46.500
Alberta dead?

01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:49.650
They said they done all they could.
They...

01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:52.534
They couldn't do nothing for her.

01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:26.531
What about the baby? Baby all right?

01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:30.531
They say it's healthy.

01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:34.294
I wonder who's gonna bury her.

01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:35.416
She had a family, Rose.

01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:36.980
She wasn't living in
the world by herself.

01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:39.336
I know she wasn't living
in the world by herself.

01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:40.820
Next thing you wanna know
if she had any insurance.

01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:42.220
You ain't got to
talk to me like that!

01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:44.371
First thing that jumped out your
mouth. "Who's gonna bury her?"

01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:46.059
Like I'm finna take
that task on for myself.

01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:48.132
I'm your wife. Don't push me away.

01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:50.655
I ain't pushing nobody away.
Just give me some space.

01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:52.971
Just give me some room to breathe.

01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:25.252
All right, Mr. Death.

01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:33.454
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:36.100
I'm gonna take

01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:40.214
and build me a fence
around this yard, see?

01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:45.296
I'm gonna build me a fence
around what belongs to me.

01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:48.452
And then I want you to
stay on the other side.

01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:50.213
You stay over there till
you're ready for me,

01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:51.893
then you come on.

01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:57.816
Bring your army, bring your sickle,
bring your wrestling clothes.

01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:00.051
I ain't gonna fall down
on my vigilance this time.

01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:01.654
You ain't gonna...

01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:06.971
You ain't gonna sneak
up on me no more.

01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:10.889
When you ready for me,

01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:13.336
when the top of your
list say Troy Maxson,

01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:15.491
then you come on up and
knock on the front door.

01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:17.537
Ain't nobody else got
nothing to do with this.

01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:19.498
This between you and me.

01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:23.978
Man to man!

01:35:29.740 --> 01:35:33.575
You stay on the other side of
that fence till you ready for me!

01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:37.775
Then you come up and
knock on that front door

01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:41.490
anytime you want!

01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:55.532
I'll be ready for you.

01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:43.940
<i>Bob Clemente with four home
runs and 24 runs batted in.</i>

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:46.495
Rose?

01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:51.659
I'm standing here with
my daughter in my arms.

01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:53.732
Now,

01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:56.858
she ain't but a wee,

01:36:58.180 --> 01:36:59.296
bitty little old thing.

01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:01.849
She don't know nothing
about grownfolk business.

01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:03.420
She innocent,

01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:07.656
and she ain't got no mama.

01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:11.772
What you telling me for, Troy?

01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:26.893
Well...

01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:31.010
Guess we'll go sit
out here on the porch.

01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:51.577
A man's got to do
what's right for him.

01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:57.576
I ain't sorry for nothing I done.

01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:01.894
It felt right in my heart.

01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:05.932
What you smiling at?

01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:12.775
Your daddy's a great, big ol' man.

01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:20.259
Got these great big ol' hands,
but sometimes he's scared.

01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:24.491
And right now,
your daddy's scared 'cause we

01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:27.894
sitting out here on the
porch and ain't got no home.

01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:30.170
I've been homeless before.

01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:35.096
I ain't never had no baby with me,
but I've been homeless.

01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:39.778
You just be out there on
the road by your lonesome

01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:43.658
and just see one of
them trains coming by

01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:45.379
and just kinda go, say...

01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:50.931
<i>Please,
Mr. Engineer</i> <i>Let a man ride the line</i>

01:38:54.100 --> 01:38:58.731
<i>Please,
Mr. Engineer</i> <i>Let a man ride the line</i>

01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:07.532
<i>I ain't got no ticket, please</i>

01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:10.500
<i>Let me ride the blinds</i>

01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:18.171
She's my daughter, Rose, and my...

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:23.775
My own flesh and blood.
I can't deny her.

01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:26.978
No more than I can deny them boys.

01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:30.376
You and them boys is my family.

01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:36.456
You, them, and this child is
all I got in this world, so...

01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:41.211
I guess what I'm saying is,

01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:51.978
that I'd appreciate it if you
was to help me take care of her.

01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:05.140
Okay, Troy,

01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:08.809
you're right.

01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:13.571
I'll take care of your baby for you.

01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:16.732
'Cause, like you say,

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:20.695
she innocent.

01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:25.651
You can't visit the sins of
the father upon the child.

01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:31.891
Motherless child's got a hard time.

01:40:53.780 --> 01:40:56.693
From right now,
this child's got a mother.

01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:05.531
But you're a womanless man.

01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:17.612
I'm coming in, everybody going out.

01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:20.295
I'm taking this cake down to
the church for the bake sale.

01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:22.656
Lyons was by to see you.
He stopped by to pay you your $20.

01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:24.174
It's laying right here on the table.

01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:25.410
Well, here go this money.

01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:27.173
Well, put it in there on the table,
Troy. I'll get it.

01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:28.970
What time you coming back?

01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:31.416
Ain't no use in you studyin' me.
Don't matter what time I come back.

01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:33.457
I just asked you a question, woman.
Can't I ask you a question?

01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:34.610
Troy, I don't want to get into it.

01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:36.094
Now,
your food is in there on the stove.

01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:37.455
All you got to do is heat it up.

01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:40.135
And don't be eating the rest
of them cakes in there now.

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:41.256
I'm coming back for them.

01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:43.730
We're having a bake sale
at the church tomorrow.

01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:42.610
Hey, Troy.

01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:44.454
What's happening, Bono?

01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:47.294
I just thought I'd
stop by to see you.

01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:49.212
Wasn't no one at the house,
so I figured...

01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:50.529
What you stop by to see me for?

01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:53.374
You ain't stopped by
in a month of Sundays.

01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:55.292
Hell, I must owe you
some money or somethin'.

01:43:55.380 --> 01:43:58.896
Well, since you got your promotion,
I can't keep up with you.

01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:00.494
Used to see you every day.

01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:03.140
Now I don't even know
what route you working.

01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:04.210
Keep switching me around.

01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:08.658
Got me out there in Green Tree now,
hauling white folk garbage.

01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:10.493
- Green Tree, huh?
- Yeah.

01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:11.616
You lucky.

01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:14.135
At least you ain't got to
be lifting them barrels.

01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:16.416
Damn if they ain't getting heavier.

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:19.060
I'm gonna put in my two
years and call it quits.

01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:21.177
Yeah,
I'm thinking about retiring myself.

01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:23.572
You got it easy.

01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:27.540
You could drive for
another five years.

01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:28.736
Ain't the same, Bono.

01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:32.172
It ain't like working
the back of the truck.

01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:36.174
You feel like you working by
yourself. Ain't nobody to talk to.

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:40.254
Naw, I'm thinking about retiring.
How's Lucille?

01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:41.816
She all right.

01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:44.734
Her arthritis get to
acting up on her sometimes.

01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:48.177
Saw Rose on the way here.
She going down to the church, huh?

01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:50.293
Yeah, she took up going down there.

01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:53.532
All them preachers looking
to fatten their pockets.

01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:56.100
Got some gin in here.

01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:59.378
No, thanks.
I just stopped in to say hello.

01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:01.452
Well, you can take a drink, nigger.
I ain't...

01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:03.850
I ain't never known you
to say no to a drink.

01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:08.932
- You ain't got to work tomorrow.
- I just stopped by.

01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:10.540
I'm thinkin'
of going over to Skinner's.

01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:12.930
We got us a domino game going
over his house every Friday.

01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:14.659
Nigger, you can't play no dominoes.

01:45:14.740 --> 01:45:17.539
I used to whup you
four games out of five.

01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:22.133
Well, that learned me.
I'm getting better.

01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:23.970
Yeah?

01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:32.209
That's all right.

01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:37.049
Look here, I got to be getting on.

01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:40.656
- Stop by sometime, huh?
- Yeah, I'll do that, Bono.

01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:47.416
Lucille told Rose you got
her that new refrigerator.

01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:51.938
Yeah. Rose told Lucille you
had finally built your fence,

01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:53.858
so, I figured we'd call it even.

01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:57.412
- I knew you would.
- Yeah.

01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:00.855
Okay.

01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:05.929
- I'll be talking to you.
- Yeah, good to see you, Bono.

01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:09.570
- I'm gonna stop over.
- Yeah. Okay, Troy.

01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:23.011
<i>Hear it ring! Hear it ring!</i>

01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:32.780
<i>Had an old dog, his name was Blue</i>

01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:38.895
<i>You know Blue was mighty true</i>

01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:48.894
<i>You know Blue was a good old dog</i>

01:46:53.380 --> 01:46:56.214
<i>Blue treed a possum in a hollow log</i>

01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:14.093
<i>Old Blue died and I dug his grave</i>

01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:18.934
<i>Let him down with a golden chain</i>

01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:25.174
<i>Every time old Blue barked</i>

01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:31.614
<i>Blue treed a possum in Noah's Ark</i>

01:47:36.780 --> 01:47:40.410
- I got to get by.
- Say what? What you say?

01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:42.976
You in my way. I got to get by.

01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:48.732
You got to get by where?

01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:53.652
This is my house.
Bought and paid for.

01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:56.733
Took me 15 years,
and if you want to go in my house

01:47:56.820 --> 01:47:58.698
and I'm sitting on the steps,
you say, "Excuse me,"

01:47:58.780 --> 01:47:59.816
like your mama taught you.

01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:01.010
Come on, Pop, I gotta get by.

01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:02.250
You just gonna walk
over the top of me?

01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:04.093
I live here, too.

01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:06.649
You just gonna walk over the
top of me in my own house?

01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:08.009
I ain't scared of you.

01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:09.740
I ain't asked you if
you was scared of me.

01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:11.732
I asked you was you finna
walk over the top of me

01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:13.300
in my own house?
That was the question.

01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:14.780
You ain't gonna say, "Excuse me."

01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:16.010
You just gonna walk
over the top of me.

01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:17.090
If you want to put it like that.

01:48:17.180 --> 01:48:18.250
How else am I gonna put it?

01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:20.377
I was walking by you
to go into the house,

01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:22.219
'cause you sitting on the steps
drunk, singing to yourself.

01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:24.371
- You can put it like that.
- Without saying, "Excuse me"?

01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:32.294
I asked you a question.
Without saying, "Excuse me"?

01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:33.575
I ain't got to say
"Excuse me" to you.

01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:35.652
You don't count around here no more.

01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:40.019
I see. I don't count
around here no more.

01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:41.614
You ain't got to say
"Excuse me" to your daddy.

01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:44.374
All of a sudden,
you done got so grown,

01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:47.055
where your daddy don't count
around here no more, huh?

01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:48.699
Around here in his
own house and yard

01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:50.698
that he done paid for with
the sweat of his brow?

01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:54.980
All of a sudden, you done got so grown that
your daddy don't even count around here.

01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:56.653
What, you gonna take over?

01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:01.179
You gonna take over my house?
You gonna wear my pants?

01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:03.217
You gonna go in there and
stretch out on my bed?

01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:06.619
You ain't got to say, "Excuse me,"

01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:08.657
because your daddy don't
count around here no more.

01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:10.857
- Is that right?
- That's right.

01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:12.454
You always talking this dumb stuff.

01:49:12.540 --> 01:49:14.371
Now why don't you
just get out my way?

01:49:14.441 --> 01:49:16.420
I guess you got
someplace to sleep.

01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:20.574
Something to put in your belly.
You got that?

01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:26.016
'Cause that's what you need.
You got that?

01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:29.570
You don't know what I got! You
ain't got to worry about what I got!

01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:31.659
You right.

01:49:31.780 --> 01:49:33.373
You 100% right.

01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:37.215
I done spent the last 17 years
worrying about what you got.

01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:41.180
Now, it's your turn, see?
I tell you what we do.

01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:45.180
You grown. We done established that.

01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:48.374
You a man.
Now, let's see you act like one.

01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:50.213
Turn your behind around
and walk out this yard.

01:49:50.340 --> 01:49:51.844
And when you get out
there in the alley,

01:49:51.914 --> 01:49:53.380
you can forget about
this house, see.

01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:54.780
'Cause this is my house.

01:49:54.860 --> 01:49:57.534
You go on and be a man
and get your own house.

01:49:57.620 --> 01:49:59.896
You can forget about this,
'cause this is mine.

01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:02.449
You go on and get yours,
'cause I'm through doing for you.

01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:04.658
What you done for me.
What you ever give me?

01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:08.177
Them feet. Them bones.
That pumping heart, nigger!

01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:11.012
Give you more than anybody
else ever gonna give you.

01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:13.376
You ain't never gave me nothing!

01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:15.053
You ain't never done
nothing but hold me back,

01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:17.496
afraid I was gonna
be better than you!

01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:21.212
All you ever did was try
and make me scared of you.

01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:23.257
I used to tremble every
time you called my name.

01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:26.060
Every time I heard your
footsteps in this house.

01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:27.972
Wondering all the time,
"What's Pop gonna say if I do this?

01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:29.210
"What's he gonna say if I do that?

01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:31.172
"What's Pop gonna say
if I turn on the radio?"

01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:32.820
And Mom, too!
She tries, but she's scared of you.

01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:34.254
Leave your mama out of this.
Your mama ain't got...

01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:35.979
I don't know how she stands
you after what you did to her!

01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:37.414
I told you,
leave your mama outta this.

01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:39.173
What are you gonna do?
Give me a whupping?

01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:41.252
You can't whup me no more!
You're too old!

01:50:41.340 --> 01:50:42.410
You're just an old man.

01:50:42.900 --> 01:50:43.890
Nigger!

01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:45.932
That's what you are. You're just...

01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:50.934
You're just another nigger
on the street to me.

01:50:51.100 --> 01:50:53.410
- You're crazy! You know that?
- Yeah, go on.

01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:55.776
Get on away from around me.
You got the devil in you.

01:50:55.860 --> 01:50:57.002
You are just a crazy
old man! Talkin'

01:50:57.072 --> 01:50:58.056
about I got the "devil" in me!

01:50:58.140 --> 01:50:59.176
Yeah. I am crazy.

01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:01.353
If you don't get the
hell out of my yard,

01:51:01.423 --> 01:51:03.254
I'm gonna show you how crazy I am.

01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:04.854
Now, go on,
get the hell out of my yard!

01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:06.169
This ain't your yard!

01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:07.819
You took Uncle Gabe's
money he got from the Army

01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:09.414
to buy this house,
when you put him out!

01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:11.890
Get your black ass out of my yard!

01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:13.414
I ain't going nowhere!

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:15.139
Come on, put me out,
I ain't scared of you.

01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:18.813
- That's my bat.
- Come on.

01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:20.573
- Put my bat down.
- Come on, put me out!

01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:23.816
What's the matter?
You so bad. Put me out!

01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:26.052
You're gonna have to use it.

01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:29.403
You want to draw
that bat back on me,

01:51:29.473 --> 01:51:30.620
you're gonna have to use it.

01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:31.770
Come on!

01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:34.374
Come on!

01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:36.736
You're gonna have to kill me.

01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:39.972
You want to draw
that bat back on me,

01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:42.939
you're gonna have to kill me.

01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:45.610
Come on.

01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:55.732
Come on. Then I'll show you.

01:51:56.580 --> 01:51:57.650
Come on!

01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:38.931
Go on,
get away from around my house.

01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:49.690
Go on.

01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:52.492
Tell Mama I'll be
back for my things.

01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:55.493
They'll be on the other
side of that fence!

01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:09.493
Can't taste nothing.

01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:22.131
I can't taste nothing.

01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:28.890
Hallelujah!

01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:33.334
Hallelujah.

01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:45.260
Hallelujah.

01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:50.170
I can't taste nothing no more.

01:53:58.020 --> 01:53:59.374
Come on.

01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:02.451
It's between you and me now.

01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:07.536
Come on. Anytime you want.

01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:12.056
Come on. I be ready for you.

01:54:13.780 --> 01:54:16.534
But I ain't gonna be easy.

01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:30.129
<i>Raynell?</i>

01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:32.052
- <i>Ma'am?</i>
- <i>What you doing?</i>

01:54:32.140 --> 01:54:33.256
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:35.900
Get in here and get dressed.
What are you doing?

01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:37.653
See if my garden growed.

01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:39.334
I told you it ain't
gonna grow overnight.

01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:40.570
You got to wait.

01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:43.540
Yeah, but it look like it ain't
never gonna grow, Mama. Dag!

01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:46.575
I told you,
a watched pot never boils.

01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:48.253
This ain't even no pot, Mama.

01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:49.330
Get in here and get dressed.

01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:51.218
This ain't no morning to be
playing around, you hear me?

01:54:51.820 --> 01:54:53.174
Yes, ma'am.

01:54:55.780 --> 01:54:57.817
Bye, garden.

01:55:19.260 --> 01:55:22.537
Hi. I bet your name is Raynell.

01:55:25.100 --> 01:55:26.454
Is your mama home?

01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:30.137
Mama, there's a man down here!

01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:31.970
Mama!

01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:34.054
Cory?

01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:37.609
Cory.

01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:40.133
Cory. Cory!

01:55:41.580 --> 01:55:44.414
Lord have mercy! Cory.

01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:50.020
Lookee here, y'all.

01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:56.854
- Looka here.
- Done got all grown up.

01:55:56.940 --> 01:55:58.579
Don't cry, Mama.
What you crying about?

01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:01.129
I'm just so glad you made it.

01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:03.212
Hey, Lyons. How you doing, Mr. Bono?

01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:05.412
Look at you, man, look at you.

01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:08.334
Don't he look good, Rose?
Got on them corporal stripes.

01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:09.820
What took you so long?

01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:10.936
You know how the Marines are, Mama.

01:56:11.020 --> 01:56:12.201
They got to get all their paperwork

01:56:12.271 --> 01:56:13.655
straight before they
let you do anything.

01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:17.051
Well, I'm sure glad you made it.
They let Lyons come.

01:56:17.140 --> 01:56:18.494
Your Uncle Gabe's
still in the hospital.

01:56:18.580 --> 01:56:20.458
They don't know if they're
gonna let him out or not.

01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:22.020
I talked to them a little while ago.

01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:24.410
A corporal in the
United States Marines.

01:56:24.580 --> 01:56:28.654
Your daddy knew you had it in you.
He used to tell me all the time.

01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:30.692
Hey, don't he look good, Mr. Bono?

01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:34.410
Yeah, he reminds me of
Troy when I first met him.

01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:36.934
Say, Rose,

01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:39.330
Lucille's down at the
church with the choir.

01:56:39.460 --> 01:56:41.292
I'm gonna go get the
pallbearers lined up.

01:56:41.420 --> 01:56:42.615
I'll be back to get you all.

01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:44.089
Thanks, Jim.

01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:45.170
See you, Mr. Bono.

01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:52.372
Cory, look at Raynell.

01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:53.496
Ain't she precious?

01:56:53.580 --> 01:56:54.934
She's gonna break a
whole lot of hearts.

01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:56.780
Say hello to your brother.
This your brother, Cory.

01:56:56.860 --> 01:56:59.216
- You remember Cory?
- No, ma'am.

01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:00.370
Naw, she don't remember me, Mama.

01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:03.020
Well, we talk about you.
She heard us talk about you.

01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:06.135
This is your brother, Cory.
Say hello.

01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:07.540
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:08.849
So, you're Raynell.

01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:12.336
Mama's told me a lot about you.

01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:14.771
Come on, let me fix you some
breakfast. Keep up your strength.

01:57:14.860 --> 01:57:15.930
I ain't hungry, Mama.

01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:18.894
You can fix me something, Rose.
I'll be in there in a minute.

01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:20.380
You sure you don't want nothing,
Cory?

01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:22.059
I know they ain't feeding you right.

01:57:22.140 --> 01:57:23.540
No, Mama, thanks.
I don't feel like eating.

01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:24.690
I'll get something later.

01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:28.614
Raynell, get up there and get
that dress on like I told you.

01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:43.018
I always knew you was gonna
make something out of yourself.

01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:47.255
Your head was always
in the right direction.

01:57:50.260 --> 01:57:51.330
So,

01:57:53.020 --> 01:57:54.739
you gonna stay in?

01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:57.096
Make it a career?
Put in your 20 years?

01:57:57.500 --> 01:58:01.096
I don't know. I got six already.
I think that's enough.

01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:04.776
Stick with Uncle Sam
and retire early.

01:58:04.860 --> 01:58:06.692
Ain't nothing out here.

01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:11.094
I guess Rose told you about
what happened with me.

01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:16.340
They got me down at the workhouse.

01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:19.140
I thought I was being slick
cashing other people's checks.

01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:22.213
How much time you doing?

01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:25.529
They give me three years.

01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:28.772
I got that beat now.
I ain't got but nine more months.

01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:36.530
It ain't so bad.

01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:39.619
You learn to deal with
it like anything else.

01:58:41.900 --> 01:58:43.857
"You got to take the
crookeds with the straights,"

01:58:43.940 --> 01:58:47.138
that's what Papa used to say.

01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:50.816
He used to say that
when he struck out.

01:58:50.900 --> 01:58:53.096
I seen him strike out
three times in a row,

01:58:53.180 --> 01:58:57.413
and the next time up,
he hit the ball over the grandstand.

01:58:57.500 --> 01:59:00.459
Right out there in Homestead Field.

01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:03.032
He wasn't satisfied
hitting in the seats.

01:59:03.102 --> 01:59:04.889
He wanted to hit it over everything.

01:59:06.420 --> 01:59:08.093
Then after the game,

01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:14.177
he had 200 people standing around,
waiting to shake his hand.

01:59:17.580 --> 01:59:20.175
You got to take the
crookeds with the straights.

01:59:23.860 --> 01:59:25.613
Papa was something else.

01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:28.931
You still playing?

01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:30.693
Cory, you know I'm gonna do that.

01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:33.851
We got some fellas down there.
We got us a band.

01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:36.933
We gonna try to stay together
when we get out, but...

01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:38.090
Yeah.

01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:41.691
I'm still playing.

01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:43.814
Still helps me get out
of bed in the morning.

01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:45.095
As long as it do that,

01:59:45.180 --> 01:59:48.617
I'm gonna stick with it,
try to make some sense out of it.

01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:51.215
Lyons, I got these eggs in a pan.

01:59:53.700 --> 01:59:55.612
Let me get in here and
get these eggs, man.

01:59:55.700 --> 01:59:57.737
Get ready to go bury Papa.

02:00:03.740 --> 02:00:05.060
How you doing?

02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:08.140
You doing all right?

02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:28.734
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:31.254
You used to sleep in my room?

02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:34.532
Yeah, that used to be my room.

02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:38.013
That's what Papa call it.
"Cory's room."

02:00:40.340 --> 02:00:42.252
Got your football in the closet.

02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:45.413
Raynell. Get up there, get dressed,
and put them good shoes on.

02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:47.851
Mama, can I just wear these?
Them others hurt my feet!

02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:49.818
Well, they're just gonna have
to hurt your feet for a while.

02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:51.052
You ain't said they
hurt your feet when

02:00:51.122 --> 02:00:52.335
you went down to the
store and got 'em.

02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:54.611
They didn't hurt then.
My feet done got bigger.

02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:56.259
Don't give me no back talk!

02:00:56.380 --> 02:00:59.179
Get up there, get dressed,
and put them good shoes on.

02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:09.694
Ain't too much changed.

02:02:09.780 --> 02:02:12.420
He still got that
rag tied to the tree.

02:02:15.700 --> 02:02:17.692
He was out here swinging that bat.

02:02:19.260 --> 02:02:22.094
I was just getting ready
to go back in the house.

02:02:23.380 --> 02:02:26.100
He swung that bat
and just fell over.

02:02:28.620 --> 02:02:30.148
Seem like, when he swung it,

02:02:30.218 --> 02:02:32.455
he stood there with
this grin on his face.

02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:40.053
Then he just fell over.

02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:44.986
They carried him down
there to the hospital,

02:02:45.056 --> 02:02:46.657
but I knew there wasn't no need.

02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:50.841
Why don't you come
on in the house?

02:02:50.911 --> 02:02:52.770
Mama, I got something to tell you.

02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:57.292
I don't know how to tell you this,
but I got to tell you.

02:02:57.420 --> 02:02:59.412
I'm not going to Papa's funeral.

02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:05.575
Boy, hush your mouth.

02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:07.652
That's your daddy you talking about!

02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:09.937
I don't want to hear that
kind of talk this morning.

02:03:10.020 --> 02:03:11.420
I done raised you to come to this?

02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:12.820
You standing there
all healthy and grown,

02:03:12.900 --> 02:03:14.653
talking about you ain't going
to your daddy's funeral?

02:03:14.740 --> 02:03:16.936
- Mama, listen...
- I don't want to hear it, Cory!

02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:18.340
Just get that thought
out of your head.

02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:19.481
I've got to say no to him.

02:03:19.551 --> 02:03:21.060
One time in my life,
I got to say no.

02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:22.654
I don't got to listen to that!

02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:24.333
Now, I know you and your
daddy ain't seen eye to eye,

02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:27.857
but I don't have to listen to
that kind of talk this morning.

02:03:27.940 --> 02:03:30.500
Disrespecting your daddy ain't
gonna make you a man, Cory.

02:03:30.620 --> 02:03:32.339
You gotta find some way to
come to that on your own.

02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:34.889
Not going to your daddy's funeral
ain't gonna make you a man.

02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:40.853
The whole time I was growing up,
living in his house,

02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:43.853
Papa was like a shadow that
followed you everywhere.

02:03:44.620 --> 02:03:47.852
It weighed on you,
and it sunk into your flesh.

02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:50.497
It would wrap around
you and lay there

02:03:50.580 --> 02:03:53.015
until you couldn't tell
which one was you anymore.

02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:57.293
That shadow just diggin'
into your flesh!

02:03:57.380 --> 02:03:59.690
Trying to crawl in.
Trying to live through you.

02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:05.297
Everywhere I looked, I saw Troy
Maxson staring right back at me.

02:04:05.380 --> 02:04:08.532
Hiding under the bed, in the closet.

02:04:08.620 --> 02:04:11.658
I'm just saying I got to find a way
to get rid of that shadow, Mama.

02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:13.971
You just like him.
You got him in you good.

02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:15.210
Don't tell me that, Mama.

02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:18.976
- You Troy Maxson all over again.
- I don't want to be Troy Maxson!

02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:21.893
I just want to be me.

02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:24.893
You can't be nobody but who you are,
Cory.

02:04:24.980 --> 02:04:28.052
That shadow wasn't nothing
but you growing into yourself.

02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:30.217
You either got to grow into it,
or cut it down to fit you,

02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:32.576
but that's all you got
to make a life with.

02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:34.860
That's all you got
to measure yourself

02:04:34.930 --> 02:04:36.654
against the world out there.

02:04:37.660 --> 02:04:40.573
Your daddy wanted you to
be everything he wasn't,

02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:42.174
and at the same time,

02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:45.014
he wanted you to be
everything he was.

02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:47.059
Now, I don't know if
he was right or wrong,

02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:48.256
but I do know

02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:51.333
he meant to do more good
than he meant to do harm.

02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:56.174
Sometimes, when he touched,
he bruised,

02:04:56.940 --> 02:05:00.217
and sometimes,
when he took me in his arms, he cut.

02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:09.171
When I first met your daddy,

02:05:10.100 --> 02:05:11.534
I thought,

02:05:11.780 --> 02:05:14.852
"Here is a man I can lay
down with and make a baby."

02:05:18.460 --> 02:05:21.373
That's the first thing I
thought when I seen him.

02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:23.770
I thought, "Rose Lee,

02:05:24.460 --> 02:05:26.577
"here's a man you can
open yourself up to

02:05:26.660 --> 02:05:28.856
"and be filled to bursting!

02:05:30.380 --> 02:05:35.136
"Here's a man that can fill
up all them empty spaces

02:05:35.220 --> 02:05:37.860
"you been tipping
around the edges of."

02:05:43.140 --> 02:05:46.133
When your daddy walked
through the house,

02:05:46.220 --> 02:05:47.893
he was just

02:05:49.060 --> 02:05:51.416
so big.

02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:54.813
He filled it up!

02:05:57.340 --> 02:06:00.174
That was my first mistake.

02:06:00.260 --> 02:06:02.570
Not to make him leave
some room for me.

02:06:07.180 --> 02:06:09.649
But I wanted a house
I could sing in.

02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:14.332
And that's what your daddy gave me.

02:06:14.420 --> 02:06:16.344
I didn't know to keep
up his strength,

02:06:16.414 --> 02:06:18.494
I had to give up
little pieces of mine.

02:06:20.340 --> 02:06:23.697
I took on his life as mine
and mixed up the pieces,

02:06:23.780 --> 02:06:26.773
so you couldn't hardly
tell which was which.

02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:32.772
It was my choice. My life.

02:06:32.860 --> 02:06:35.853
And I didn't have to
live it like that,

02:06:37.940 --> 02:06:39.335
but that's what life offered me

02:06:39.405 --> 02:06:41.295
in the way of being a woman,
and I took it.

02:06:43.460 --> 02:06:46.294
I grabbed it with both hands.

02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:49.452
And by the time Raynell
came into the house...

02:06:54.460 --> 02:06:58.818
I didn't want to make my blessings
off of nobody's misfortune,

02:07:00.660 --> 02:07:03.732
but I took on to
Raynell like she was

02:07:03.820 --> 02:07:06.972
all them babies I
wanted and never had.

02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:12.213
Like I'd been blessed to
relive a part of my life.

02:07:15.340 --> 02:07:18.492
And if the Lord see fit
to keep up my strength,

02:07:20.580 --> 02:07:24.574
I'm gonna do her exactly
how your daddy did you.

02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:30.934
I'm gonna give her the
best of what's in me.

02:07:40.940 --> 02:07:41.930
Mama!

02:07:42.100 --> 02:07:44.171
Reverend Tolliver on the phone.

02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:02.930
Hi.

02:08:05.460 --> 02:08:06.450
Hi.

02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:10.690
- You in the Army or the Marines?
- Marines.

02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:15.132
Papa said it was Army.
You know Blue?

02:08:15.540 --> 02:08:16.894
Blue? Who's Blue?

02:08:17.220 --> 02:08:19.291
Papa's dog,
what he sing about all the time.

02:08:22.060 --> 02:08:24.575
<i>Hear it ring! Hear it ring!</i>

02:08:26.300 --> 02:08:28.735
<i>Had an old dog, his name was Blue</i>

02:08:29.580 --> 02:08:31.651
<i>You know Blue was mighty true</i>

02:08:32.740 --> 02:08:35.050
<i>You know Blue was a good old dog</i>

02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:38.177
<i>Blue treed a possum in a hollow log</i>

02:08:39.420 --> 02:08:41.173
<i>From that you know
Blue was a good old dog</i>

02:08:41.260 --> 02:08:43.570
<i>Hear it ring! Hear it ring!</i>

02:08:44.340 --> 02:08:47.094
<i>Blue treed a possum out on a limb</i>

02:08:47.180 --> 02:08:49.012
<i>Blue looked at me
and I looked at him</i>

02:08:49.740 --> 02:08:52.175
<i>Grabbed that possum,
put him in a sack</i>

02:08:52.260 --> 02:08:54.092
<i>Blue stayed there till I came back</i>

02:08:54.580 --> 02:08:57.095
<i>Old Blue's feet was big and round</i>

02:08:57.180 --> 02:08:59.251
<i>Never let a possum touch the ground</i>

02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:02.011
<i>Old Blue died and I dug his grave</i>

02:09:02.100 --> 02:09:04.490
<i>I dug his grave with a silver spade</i>

02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:07.250
<i>Let him down with a golden chain</i>

02:09:07.340 --> 02:09:09.252
<i>And every night I call his name</i>

02:09:09.620 --> 02:09:11.612
<i>Go on, Blue, you good dog you</i>

02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:12.690
Come on.

02:09:12.780 --> 02:09:14.931
<i>Go on, Blue, you good dog you</i>

02:09:15.260 --> 02:09:17.775
<i>Blue laid down and died like a man</i>

02:09:18.100 --> 02:09:20.217
<i>Blue laid down and died</i>

02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:24.771
<i>Blue laid down and died like a man</i>

02:09:25.940 --> 02:09:28.774
<i>Now he's treeing possums
In the Promised Land</i>

02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:32.295
<i>I'm gonna tell you this
Just to let you know</i>

02:09:32.620 --> 02:09:35.135
<i>Blue's gone where the good dogs go</i>

02:09:36.980 --> 02:09:40.291
<i>Blue's gone where the good dogs go</i>

02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:46.050
Cory,
we're getting ready to leave now!

02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:55.974
Go upstairs and put your
shoes on like Mama told you,

02:09:56.140 --> 02:09:58.974
so we can get ready to
go to Papa's funeral.

02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:02.131
Okay. I'll be back.

02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:13.416
Rose!

02:10:16.340 --> 02:10:17.660
Hey, Rose!

02:10:18.020 --> 02:10:20.171
- Gabe?
- I'm here! I'm here, Rose!

02:10:20.260 --> 02:10:22.172
Hey, Rose, I'm here!

02:10:22.260 --> 02:10:23.853
- Lyons, lookit here!
- See, Rose?

02:10:23.940 --> 02:10:25.772
I told you.
I told you they'd let him come.

02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:27.852
- How you doing, Uncle Gabe?
- How you doing, Uncle Gabe?

02:10:27.940 --> 02:10:30.091
Hey! Hey, Rose, it's time!

02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:33.537
It's time to tell Saint
Peter to open the Gates.

02:10:36.860 --> 02:10:40.297
You ready, Troy? Troy, you ready?

02:10:40.380 --> 02:10:43.293
I'm gonna tell Saint
Peter to open the Gates.

02:10:43.380 --> 02:10:45.690
You get ready now.

02:11:16.060 --> 02:11:17.289
Troy!

02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:19.300
