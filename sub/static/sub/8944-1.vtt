WEBVTT

00:47.210 --> 00:49.910
 Light as a feather
Stiff as a board

00:49.910 --> 00:52.880
 I'm-a elevate myself
on my own accord

00:53.380 --> 00:56.830
 Ain't nobody's business
Who's life is this?

00:56.840 --> 00:59.590
 You question my existence
I'm-a read you the list

00:59.590 --> 01:02.720
 I'll keep you on your toes
That's just how it goes

01:02.720 --> 01:05.930
 You can deal with the lows
Just keep dodging the blows

01:05.930 --> 01:09.260
 So I'm-a do me
Who else do I be?

01:09.260 --> 01:12.400
 'Cause I create
my own destiny

01:12.400 --> 01:15.820
 I'm-a take back the world
Yo, you got this, girl

01:15.820 --> 01:18.910
 I'm steppin' up my game
I'll keep repeating the same

01:18.910 --> 01:21.490
 Be on my hustle
every minute of the day

01:21.490 --> 01:23.500
 It was mine
for the taking anyways

01:23.500 --> 01:26.000
 I'm-a take back the world 

02:30.150 --> 02:33.650
How come you always look
so great in the morning?

02:33.650 --> 02:36.150
Do I? Aw.

02:43.940 --> 02:44.940
Got to go, babe.

02:44.940 --> 02:46.830
Oh! I made
tempeh sausage.

02:57.210 --> 03:00.010
Hey, so, I was thinking
that maybe you'd want to be my date

03:00.430 --> 03:02.430
to my sister's wedding.

03:02.430 --> 03:04.300
There's
a vegetarian alternative. I already checked.

03:06.210 --> 03:08.770
Are your parents
going to be there?

03:09.270 --> 03:13.100
At my sister's wedding?
I think so.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.610
I don't know. It just
feels a little serious.

03:16.110 --> 03:18.110
Oh.

03:18.110 --> 03:20.610
I'm sorry, it just...

03:20.610 --> 03:22.110
It felt kind of
serious last night

03:22.110 --> 03:23.610
when you were
doing me from behind,

03:23.620 --> 03:24.980
but I couldn't
see your face, so...

03:33.910 --> 03:36.460
You know, if you ever want
to just hook up, you can call me.

03:36.460 --> 03:40.970
Oh, thank you, Rick.
That's very generous of you.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Yeah.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.500
See you around.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.340
Keep it green.

03:48.340 --> 03:50.840
 I roll with the punches
Take 'em as they come

03:50.840 --> 03:53.760
 There's some disappointment
But what's the point

03:55.730 --> 03:57.980
WOMAN: Colin, hurry up.

03:57.980 --> 04:00.820
 Take a break for a sec
Prepare for what's coming next

04:00.820 --> 04:02.820
 I'm-a take back the world

04:04.440 --> 04:05.940
DAISY:Ally, I could have told you

04:06.440 --> 04:08.330
it wasn't going to
work out with Rick two months ago.

04:08.830 --> 04:09.830
Why?

04:09.830 --> 04:12.330
You love meat,
you hate cyclists.

04:12.330 --> 04:13.330
I do love meat.

04:13.330 --> 04:14.780
And to be honest,

04:14.780 --> 04:16.279
I was always a little
worried about the way

04:16.279 --> 04:18.200
he kept wanting to
do it doggy style.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.700
Some people like that,
you know.

04:20.709 --> 04:22.260
No, nobody likes it.

04:22.260 --> 04:24.290
Even the dogs are just waiting
for it to be over.

04:24.290 --> 04:27.930
How many relationships
do I have to have before I meet the right guy?

04:27.930 --> 04:29.430
Evidently a lot.

04:29.430 --> 04:33.630
Hi. Hi, I'm the bride.
I'm Daisy. If you could just...

04:33.640 --> 04:37.060
 I'm-a take back the world
Yo, you got this, girl

04:37.560 --> 04:40.520
 I'm steppin' up my game
I'll keep repeating the same

04:40.530 --> 04:43.030
 Be on my hustle
every minute of the day

04:43.030 --> 04:44.700
 Never let it get away

04:45.200 --> 04:48.200
 I'm staying motivated
Keep it uncomplicated

04:48.200 --> 04:52.700
 Nothing in between
me and my dream

04:52.700 --> 04:55.490
 Be on my hustle
every minute of the day

04:55.490 --> 04:57.330
 It was mine
for the taking anyways

04:57.330 --> 04:59.040
 I'm-a take back the world 

04:59.040 --> 05:00.540
Hi.

05:02.330 --> 05:03.830
Hi, guys.

05:03.830 --> 05:05.330
Hi.
Hi.

05:06.330 --> 05:09.390
Right now.
Thinking or smelling?

05:09.390 --> 05:11.310
Ooh, no doubt smelling.

05:11.810 --> 05:13.970
Oh, he's
obviously thinking.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.930
Whatever she's saying
is thought-provoking.

05:15.930 --> 05:18.730
That would be true
if she's talking about what his finger smells like.

05:25.690 --> 05:26.690
Ally.

05:27.190 --> 05:27.940
Hi.

05:31.580 --> 05:34.860
Jet Li is not
related to Bruce Lee.

05:34.860 --> 05:36.860
Lee is a very common
Chinese last name.

05:37.370 --> 05:39.530
They both know kung fu,
but that's the...

05:40.540 --> 05:43.090
Keep your coat on.

05:43.090 --> 05:45.370
Okay, hold...
I got to call you back.

05:49.710 --> 05:53.100
Sweetheart,
we have to let you go.

05:53.100 --> 05:57.050
I'm sorry,
but we had to make some painful cuts.

06:01.610 --> 06:03.110
Who else
is getting fired?

06:03.110 --> 06:05.060
Well, for now,

06:06.230 --> 06:07.610
just you.

06:23.830 --> 06:24.830
Oy!

06:32.340 --> 06:36.340
Hi, Mom,
can I call you right back? I'm in a meeting. Okay.

06:44.430 --> 06:45.320
Mmm.

06:46.820 --> 06:48.190
Not necessary.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.160
No.

06:55.190 --> 06:56.190
Oh.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.500
10.5? Holy shit!

07:07.000 --> 07:08.010
I'm sorry.

07:08.010 --> 07:10.590
It just says here,
the average number of lovers

07:10.590 --> 07:13.430
women have in
their lifetime is 10.5.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.710
Yeah, that seems very high.

07:16.100 --> 07:18.630
High? No, that's low!

07:18.630 --> 07:20.130
10.5 is low!

07:20.640 --> 07:22.050
Whatever you say.

08:12.990 --> 08:14.490
Valerio!

08:37.010 --> 08:38.850
Oh! Finally!

08:38.850 --> 08:40.350
Hi, Mom.

08:41.350 --> 08:42.270
Ow.

08:42.270 --> 08:43.770
Oh, sorry.

08:43.770 --> 08:45.520
Sorry, the train was late.
You look great.

08:48.020 --> 08:49.640
I'm growing out my bangs.

08:49.640 --> 08:51.140
Mmm.

08:51.140 --> 08:53.140
Oh, where is Rick?

08:53.140 --> 08:56.030
Rick's on a business trip,
for his business.

08:56.030 --> 08:58.480
Oh, nuts!
I was looking forward to finally meeting him.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.480
At least this one
doesn't make balloon animals.

09:00.990 --> 09:03.900
Why aren't you wearing
the dress I bought you?

09:03.910 --> 09:06.210
This is
the dress you bought me.

09:06.210 --> 09:08.460
What? It looked very different
on the mannequin.

09:09.910 --> 09:10.910
Is Daisy upstairs?

09:10.910 --> 09:12.410
Yes, she is.
She is a wreck!

09:12.410 --> 09:13.910
Okay. I'm gonna
go check on her.

09:14.420 --> 09:15.920
Please do.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.920
Oh, your cousin
Beau is here.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.340
Step-cousin.

09:20.340 --> 09:23.340
He's a step-cousin.
We're not even really related.

09:25.840 --> 09:27.340
Beau.

09:28.810 --> 09:29.810
Hi.

09:30.310 --> 09:31.820
Oh, thank God
you're here.

09:31.820 --> 09:34.600
Mom has been such a bitch
ever since Eddie's parents got here.

09:34.600 --> 09:38.070
She just cannot believe
that her marriage ended before theirs did.

09:38.570 --> 09:39.570
Well, Dad should
be here soon,

09:40.070 --> 09:41.490
so she'll have someone else
to focus her hatred on.

09:41.990 --> 09:45.110
Um, Dad's not coming.
She wouldn't let me invite him here.

09:45.110 --> 09:47.200
Are you inviting
him to the wedding?

09:47.200 --> 09:49.080
I don't know.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.080
Oh.

09:53.590 --> 09:56.540
Hey, what was
Creepy Puppet Guy's actual name?

09:57.040 --> 09:59.090
You mean the guy
who lived next door who was obsessed with me?

09:59.090 --> 10:00.090
Gerry Perry.

10:00.090 --> 10:02.100
Gerry Perry! Thank you.

10:05.520 --> 10:06.930
What are you writing?

10:08.440 --> 10:10.100
Nothing,
just some notes for my toast.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.470
Is it gonna rhyme?

10:11.470 --> 10:13.720
That depends.
What rhymes with "orgy"?

10:13.720 --> 10:15.860
You just keep it
under three minutes. Ready?

10:16.230 --> 10:17.230
You look amazing.

10:17.230 --> 10:18.730
Thank you.

10:18.730 --> 10:20.230
You go ahead.
I'll be down in a couple of minutes.

10:20.230 --> 10:21.730
Okay.

10:23.820 --> 10:25.650
Eight, nine, 10, 11,

10:25.650 --> 10:27.790
12, 13, 14, 15,

10:28.120 --> 10:32.130
16, 17, 18, 19.

10:34.130 --> 10:36.630
Holy shit. 19?

10:46.510 --> 10:48.810
May I have your attention,
please?

10:49.310 --> 10:52.150
Oh, yoo-hoo!

10:52.150 --> 10:55.650
Can I have your attention,
please? I want to thank you all,

10:55.650 --> 10:57.650
each and every one...
Huh.

10:57.650 --> 10:58.650
Cute.

11:03.070 --> 11:04.580
Beau.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.910
Careful.
He can be a little rough on the nipples.

11:09.910 --> 11:12.370
...to celebrate
my dream come true,

11:12.370 --> 11:15.250
the engagement of
Daisy and Eddie.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.250
Ooh.

11:16.250 --> 11:18.460
As most of you know,
we are a family

11:18.460 --> 11:20.460
that likes to
toast one another.

11:20.460 --> 11:24.960
So, to start the ball rolling,
Daisy's big sister... Ally?

11:25.960 --> 11:26.960
Ally.

11:31.220 --> 11:32.520
ALLY: Hello.

11:33.350 --> 11:34.360
Hello.

11:44.780 --> 11:48.290
When Daisy first told me
that she was dating Eddie,

11:48.290 --> 11:49.150
I couldn't believe it.

11:49.620 --> 11:51.120
GUESTS: Aw!

11:51.120 --> 11:54.710
I said, "Eddie Vogel?

11:54.710 --> 11:57.210
"The schmuck you went out with
in high school?

11:57.210 --> 11:59.080
"He was the biggest douche-bag
of them all."

12:00.970 --> 12:03.250
Even worse than Baby Hands.
You guys remember him?

12:04.670 --> 12:06.140
Baby Hands.

12:08.140 --> 12:10.260
You know how Eddie
broke up with her?

12:10.760 --> 12:12.260
He started dating
her best friend,

12:12.260 --> 12:13.890
who's here tonight,
by the way.

12:13.890 --> 12:15.730
Sheila, stand up.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.900
But...

12:22.900 --> 12:25.410
But

12:25.910 --> 12:29.910
when Eddie saw Daisy
at their high school reunion,

12:29.910 --> 12:32.410
he knew what a big
mistake he had made.

12:32.410 --> 12:34.420
No offense, Sheila.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.450
And now, Eddie's amazing.

12:36.450 --> 12:38.450
You wouldn't even know
he's the same guy.

12:38.450 --> 12:41.510
Except he looks
exactly the same.

12:44.790 --> 12:47.800
God! I wish I went
to my high school reunion,

12:47.800 --> 12:50.550
but I was
growing out my bangs.

12:50.550 --> 12:53.770
I'm always
growing out my bangs. Don't get bangs.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.860
Well, to Daisy and Eddie!

13:03.310 --> 13:04.980
It's okay. It's okay.

13:11.990 --> 13:15.490
SHEILA: Okay,
to Daisy and Eddie and the end of your life.

13:15.990 --> 13:16.990
To Daisy and Eddie.

13:16.990 --> 13:19.380
ALL: To Daisy and Eddie.
To me.

13:22.250 --> 13:23.960
Okay, it's party game time!

13:23.960 --> 13:25.470
Oh, a game? Really?

13:25.470 --> 13:26.750
Absolutely!

13:26.750 --> 13:30.750
But which one?
God, what to play? What to play?

13:30.750 --> 13:33.340
Ooh! Let's write down
the number of people we slept with.

13:33.340 --> 13:34.720
Great idea, Katie.
What?

13:34.730 --> 13:38.650
Okay, we just need paper
and more drinks. Be right back.

13:43.980 --> 13:46.990
Of all the gin joints
in all the towns.

13:46.990 --> 13:50.990
Of all the cliches
in all the world.

13:50.990 --> 13:54.860
Wow. I didn't know you were
gonna take getting fired so hard.

13:54.860 --> 13:58.870
I don't have to laugh
at your jokes anymore because you're not my boss.

13:58.870 --> 14:01.870
Let me buy you these drinks.
I feel really bad about today.

14:02.870 --> 14:03.700
Really?

14:04.120 --> 14:06.120
Thanks. I can't
afford them anyway.

14:06.120 --> 14:07.510
Can I be honest
with you?

14:07.960 --> 14:10.290
You never seemed
to like marketing anyhow.

14:10.290 --> 14:11.260
I liked it.

14:11.260 --> 14:12.630
Yeah, but you
didn't love it.

14:13.130 --> 14:14.630
I guess I did you a favor.

14:15.130 --> 14:19.390
Now you can go get
a job that you love with a boss who you, uh, like.

14:20.270 --> 14:21.770
I like you.

14:21.770 --> 14:24.110
Really? How much?

14:27.390 --> 14:28.400
She bought the whole bottle,
didn't she?

14:31.030 --> 14:33.450
ALLY: Okay, so just write down
the number of guys you've slept with

14:33.450 --> 14:34.950
and put it in this glass,

14:34.950 --> 14:38.370
and then we'll
pick out the number and guess who it belongs to.

14:38.370 --> 14:39.870
Daisy, you go first.

14:39.870 --> 14:40.990
Yeah.

14:42.290 --> 14:43.290
Four.

14:43.710 --> 14:44.880
Oh! That's me.
Yay!

14:45.380 --> 14:46.880
No, no, no, that's not
how you're supposed to play the game.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.830
We're supposed to guess.

14:48.830 --> 14:50.830
Who wasn't gonna guess Katie?
She married Matt when she was, like, 12.

14:51.340 --> 14:52.420
I'm surprised
you've had that many.

14:52.420 --> 14:53.420
Well...

14:53.920 --> 14:55.340
ALLY: Katie,
your turn, let's go.

14:56.840 --> 14:59.840
Eight. Eight... Daisy.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.850
Yes, and I am twice
the woman you are.

15:03.480 --> 15:04.930
Six.

15:05.430 --> 15:07.320
Jamie?
Yep, that's me.

15:07.320 --> 15:09.270
Wait a second,
you're a seven.

15:09.770 --> 15:10.990
I never had sex
with Lars.

15:10.990 --> 15:12.490
Yes, you did.

15:12.990 --> 15:15.030
No. He only stuck
it in just a little, so it doesn't count.

15:15.030 --> 15:16.410
How much was it in?

15:16.410 --> 15:18.200
This much.

15:18.200 --> 15:19.700
What is that?
That tells me nothing.

15:19.700 --> 15:21.420
I've no idea
how big Lars' penis is.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.250
I do. Counts.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.620
Okay. How much needs to go in
to be considered sex?

15:26.120 --> 15:27.500
Anything more
than the tip.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.840
Fine, I'm a seven.
I mean, eight.

15:30.290 --> 15:32.010
Shit! Nine!
Atta girl.

15:32.010 --> 15:33.180
Okay, Jamie, you go.

15:35.210 --> 15:36.710
Hmm.

15:36.710 --> 15:37.970
Thirteen.

15:37.970 --> 15:39.970
KATIE:Thirteen?
Who here is a 13?

15:40.430 --> 15:41.220
Me.

15:41.220 --> 15:42.850
Whore!
Trashy girl. Slut.

15:43.270 --> 15:44.770
KATIE: Sheila!
JAMIE: Slut!

15:45.270 --> 15:46.770
Slutty whore!

15:46.770 --> 15:48.360
What is the big deal?

15:48.360 --> 15:51.610
That is 13 different
penises in one vagina.

15:51.610 --> 15:54.450
SHEILA: It's not like
they were all in there at the same time.

15:54.450 --> 15:57.870
You know what?
I'm done with this. Ally, you go.

15:57.870 --> 15:59.870
Okay.

16:02.460 --> 16:04.460
Go, go,
go, go.

16:10.050 --> 16:11.050
Oh!

16:11.050 --> 16:13.420
Wow, look at that, nine.

16:13.420 --> 16:15.420
I drew myself. Game over.

16:15.420 --> 16:17.390
Wait. A one.
Is this yours?

16:18.390 --> 16:20.590
Uh...
Oh, my God.

16:20.590 --> 16:22.060
You're at 91.

16:22.060 --> 16:24.560
No! I'm at nine!

16:24.560 --> 16:26.560
You're at 19.

16:26.560 --> 16:27.730
KATIE: Nineteen!

16:31.190 --> 16:32.570
Hello, friend.

16:32.570 --> 16:34.520
Fine, I admit it. I'm at 19,

16:35.020 --> 16:37.520
almost twice the national
average. It's bad!

16:37.520 --> 16:41.030
And look at this, there's
even a whole article in  Marie Claire about it.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.500
I thought that
playing this game

16:42.500 --> 16:44.330
would make me feel
better about my number,

16:44.330 --> 16:46.700
but now I think
the homeless lady on the train was right.

16:46.700 --> 16:47.700
It's high!

16:47.700 --> 16:49.840
Apparently in America,
96% of women

16:49.840 --> 16:53.840
who have been with
20 or more lovers can't find a husband.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.790
It actually says 20?
Mmm-hmm.

16:55.790 --> 16:57.040
Who cares?
Who did that study anyway?

16:57.040 --> 16:59.430
The scientists over there
at  Marie Claire magazine?

16:59.430 --> 17:02.550
Hey, that magazine
taught me how to orgasm.

17:02.550 --> 17:05.349
Actually, that study
was conducted by Dr. Helen Fig,

17:05.720 --> 17:08.220
a postdoctoral fellow
at Harvard University.

17:08.220 --> 17:09.390
Shit!

17:09.390 --> 17:11.390
I see it in my practice
all the time.

17:11.390 --> 17:12.890
When you're too
sexually available,

17:12.890 --> 17:14.390
it messes with
your self-esteem.

17:14.400 --> 17:18.400
Next thing you know,
you're 45 with no self-respect, no husband,

17:18.700 --> 17:20.369
and no muscle tone
in your pelvic floor.

17:22.369 --> 17:24.740
Okay. Well, that is
not gonna happen to me.

17:24.740 --> 17:26.710
Harvard says that
20 is the limit.

17:26.710 --> 17:30.210
I'm at 19,
so that gives me one more chance.

17:31.710 --> 17:33.210
Okay.

17:33.210 --> 17:34.830
I'm gonna make a proclamation.

17:36.330 --> 17:38.340
Shut up! I'm proclamating.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.840
Okay.
I am not gonna sleep with one more guy

17:42.840 --> 17:45.480
until I am sure
he's the one.

17:45.480 --> 17:46.810
I may not have
control over much,

17:46.810 --> 17:50.230
but I do have control
over my pelvic floor.

17:50.230 --> 17:53.270
The next guy who vacations
at  casa esperanza

17:53.770 --> 17:55.270
is going to be my husband.

17:55.770 --> 17:56.650
All right.
Yeah.

17:56.650 --> 18:00.160
To taking control
of my own destiny.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.660
ALL: To taking control!

18:07.780 --> 18:11.120
To better decision-making
and goal-following-through.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.920
To better
decision-making and goals!

18:14.920 --> 18:17.010
To 20!

18:17.010 --> 18:18.380
ALL: To 20!

19:00.670 --> 19:02.170
Oh, shit.

19:11.260 --> 19:14.260
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.

19:18.600 --> 19:19.600
Hi.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.600
I slept with my ex-boss.

19:21.610 --> 19:22.410
Carol?

19:22.410 --> 19:24.780
No! The job
I just got fired from.

19:24.780 --> 19:26.280
You got fired?

19:26.280 --> 19:27.660
This is your fault.

19:27.660 --> 19:30.330
When I tried to get you
to leave the bar last night, you spit on me.

19:30.330 --> 19:31.660
But congratulations.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.170
You said 20 is your husband.
Now you're at 20.

19:34.170 --> 19:35.670
Shut up.
I have to admit

19:35.670 --> 19:38.120
that I just did not think
it was gonna happen this quickly,

19:38.120 --> 19:39.540
but I'm so excited.

19:39.540 --> 19:42.040
Hey, Eddie,
Ally's gonna get married.

19:42.540 --> 19:43.840
Great.
He's thrilled.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.760
I know you're
just being a bitch, but maybe he is my husband.

19:46.760 --> 19:50.130
Maybe it's fate. Now we've
got a great story to tell our grandkids.

19:52.970 --> 19:55.970
I don't know why I never
considered him before.

20:02.980 --> 20:04.780
He's not my husband.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.910
Morning.
Morning.

20:12.410 --> 20:13.210
Hey,
you're out of toilet paper.

20:13.210 --> 20:14.120
Okay.

20:14.630 --> 20:15.630
Oh, did you
make coffee?

20:15.630 --> 20:18.000
No. There's a Starbucks
on your way to the T.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
Oh, that's okay.
Did you get the newspaper?

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
No, no, I don't get that.

20:24.470 --> 20:27.090
Morning, 6-C.
That's not mine.

20:27.090 --> 20:30.090
Okay. I locked myself
out of my apartment.

20:30.090 --> 20:32.590
My keys and wallet,
everything, it's over there.

20:32.590 --> 20:33.480
Can I use your phone?

20:33.930 --> 20:36.230
Sure, of course,
let me just get that.

20:36.230 --> 20:37.600
Hey, Roger,
why don't we talk later?

20:37.600 --> 20:40.520
Because I think 6-A
really needs my help.

20:40.520 --> 20:42.020
Colin.
Hi.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.820
Nice to meet you.
Yeah.

20:47.440 --> 20:48.740
So,

20:50.160 --> 20:51.490
how about
some dinner tonight?

20:53.000 --> 20:54.860
Tonight, tonight?
Mmm-hmm.

20:55.370 --> 20:57.870
Oh, we have that
tenants' meeting tonight.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.500
Oh! That's right.
Tenants' meeting.

21:03.540 --> 21:06.760
Oh, we're trying to get
this very loud bird evicted.

21:07.260 --> 21:11.970
But why don't I call you later
and we'll figure out

21:11.970 --> 21:16.470
maybe another time
that we can get together.

21:16.470 --> 21:17.300
Okay.

21:27.030 --> 21:28.310
ALLY: Bye.

21:34.710 --> 21:37.210
Hi, I'm Roger.

21:37.210 --> 21:39.210
Hey, do you think the woman
coming out of your apartment

21:39.210 --> 21:41.710
could have helped you
with the "being locked out" problem?

21:44.630 --> 21:46.130
Okay.

21:46.130 --> 21:49.140
Uh, I had a little situation
that I needed to get out of,

21:49.140 --> 21:51.220
not unlike your
situation here, so I...

21:51.220 --> 21:53.220
Lied to her,
then lied to me?

21:53.220 --> 21:56.260
I look at it as trying
to avoid hurt feelings.

21:57.760 --> 21:58.560
Wow.

21:58.980 --> 22:00.480
This is pretty cool.
Where'd you get this?

22:00.480 --> 22:01.930
I made it.

22:02.930 --> 22:03.930
No shit.

22:03.930 --> 22:04.940
Shit.

22:04.940 --> 22:06.690
Listen, I don't want
to have anything to do

22:06.690 --> 22:09.570
with your crusade to sleep
with every woman in Boston, okay?

22:09.570 --> 22:11.240
They're kind of
like my sisters.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.490
Wow. I thought you'd
be cooler than this.

22:13.490 --> 22:15.330
I saw that toast
you made on YouTube.

22:15.330 --> 22:16.830
Seemed like you had
a good sense of humor.

22:16.830 --> 22:19.950
Those bitches put my toast up
on YouTube?

22:19.950 --> 22:21.450
How did you see it already?

22:21.450 --> 22:24.000
I got everybody
in the building on Google Alert.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.040
I come from a family of cops,
it's in my nature to dig up dirt.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.880
Guy in 4-D tried
to marry his dog.

22:29.880 --> 22:31.290
No! Bandit?

22:31.290 --> 22:32.800
Oh, yeah.

22:32.800 --> 22:37.300
All right, well, looks
like the coast is clear.

22:37.300 --> 22:39.300
Thank you. You're a peach.

22:39.300 --> 22:40.140
You're a pig.

22:46.360 --> 22:47.360
Mmm.

22:50.360 --> 22:51.950
This is good.

22:51.950 --> 22:55.530
Okay, okay, that's enough.
I think the idea is just to taste them.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.040
Why? Nobody's ever gonna
see me naked again.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.040
I might as well enjoy myself.

22:59.040 --> 23:02.540
Yeah, like you're
really gonna be celibate.

23:02.540 --> 23:05.550
I don't have a choice.
I said I was gonna stop at 20,

23:05.550 --> 23:09.050
and now, thanks to
that finger-smelling fuck, I'm at 20.

23:09.050 --> 23:11.050
Just promise me
you're not gonna put me at the singles' table

23:11.550 --> 23:13.890
with Sheila and her mom.
Please.

23:13.890 --> 23:16.390
Seating is
really complicated.

23:16.390 --> 23:17.890
Oh, my God.

23:19.890 --> 23:21.900
Wait.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.510
Does that guy
look familiar to you?

23:23.510 --> 23:24.900
No.

23:26.350 --> 23:27.850
Oh, shit!

23:27.850 --> 23:29.850
What?

23:29.850 --> 23:33.360
That's Disgusting Donald!
I dated him.

23:34.860 --> 23:35.860
Did I ever meet him?

23:35.860 --> 23:37.360
No! Nobody did.

23:39.360 --> 23:42.500
He's the reason
I learned to cook.

23:42.500 --> 23:46.500
We have
nothing to eat! Honey, let's go out tonight.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.010
I don't know. There's just
so many people out there.

23:52.010 --> 23:53.510
Come on. I want to try

23:53.510 --> 23:55.510
the new Korean
barbecue place everyone's talking about.

23:55.510 --> 23:58.010
I can make Korean barbecue.
Easy. What do we need?

23:58.010 --> 24:01.180
Uh, a table with
a grill built into it.

24:01.180 --> 24:05.190
That guy doesn't
look disgusting at all. He's actually kind of cute.

24:05.190 --> 24:06.690
I know, but I really
think it's him.

24:07.190 --> 24:09.560
All right,
well, go say hi and see.

24:14.780 --> 24:15.780
Mmm.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.120
Ally?

24:24.120 --> 24:25.290
Donald?

24:25.290 --> 24:26.290
Oh, my gosh.

24:26.290 --> 24:27.290
It is you.
Hi.

24:27.790 --> 24:32.080
Hi. I can't believe it.
I cannot believe it.

24:32.420 --> 24:33.920
Yeah, well...

24:36.420 --> 24:39.670
Oh, Ally,
please meet my fiancee, Cara.

24:39.670 --> 24:41.060
Hi.
This is Ally.

24:41.060 --> 24:42.010
Nice to meet you.

24:42.010 --> 24:43.090
You, too.

24:43.090 --> 24:47.560
Wow.
So, how did you guys meet?

24:48.930 --> 24:51.480
At a conference.
At a conference.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.490
Can you believe it?
She's a rocket scientist.

24:53.490 --> 24:55.240
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

24:55.240 --> 24:58.240
I'm actually just an engineer,
but he loves to say that.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.410
You know,
I'm not the typical...

24:59.410 --> 25:01.410
I get it.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.910
Ally and I are old friends.

25:05.870 --> 25:07.370
What are you doing here?

25:08.870 --> 25:11.870
Oh, I'm just tasting some cake

25:12.370 --> 25:14.790
for my wedding.

25:14.790 --> 25:16.590
Oh!
I'm marrying a scientist, too.

25:17.960 --> 25:20.760
Yeah, he doesn't
look smart either.

25:20.760 --> 25:22.270
I'm here with my sister

25:22.270 --> 25:25.600
because he's up
in the North Pole

25:25.600 --> 25:27.600
dealing with
the whole icecap situation.

25:28.610 --> 25:29.770
Oh.
Yeah.

25:29.770 --> 25:32.360
He's probably gonna fix it.

25:32.360 --> 25:34.360
I can't believe that he said
that we were just friends.

25:34.860 --> 25:35.860
Like I was the embarrassment!

25:36.280 --> 25:38.560
He had man boobs,
big hairy ones.

25:38.570 --> 25:40.070
God! I can't believe
it's the same guy.

25:40.070 --> 25:42.070
He looks so good now.
He even looks taller.

25:42.070 --> 25:43.570
A lot of men get
better with age.

25:43.570 --> 25:46.070
I mean, you said it yourself,
Eddie used to be a total douche.

25:46.070 --> 25:47.540
People change.

25:49.540 --> 25:50.990
You're right.

25:50.990 --> 25:52.250
Daisy, you're a genius.

25:52.250 --> 25:53.960
I don't have to be celibate
or go over 20.

25:54.380 --> 25:55.670
What do you mean?

25:55.670 --> 25:58.670
Donald can't be my only ex
who's gotten better with time.

25:58.670 --> 26:00.390
Okay.

26:01.090 --> 26:02.300
Love you.

26:14.100 --> 26:15.100
Right.

26:21.240 --> 26:22.910
Okay. Huh!

26:22.910 --> 26:24.660
Jake Adams' dad.

26:24.660 --> 26:25.780
Jake Adams' Facebook.

26:27.530 --> 26:28.950
Okay.

26:29.370 --> 26:30.670
Jake Adams III.

26:31.030 --> 26:32.790
No, Jake Adams IV.

26:33.170 --> 26:36.510
Oh, forget it. All right,
moving on, for now.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.510
What do we have next?

26:40.510 --> 26:42.510
Mike Miller.

26:43.510 --> 26:45.100
Eleven million results?

26:45.930 --> 26:47.430
Holy shit!

26:48.720 --> 26:52.220
From Cresskill, New Jersey.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.520
Eight million results!
What the fuck?

26:55.940 --> 26:57.940
Mike Miller from Cresskill,
New Jersey,

26:57.940 --> 26:59.780
obsessed with
Bruce Springsteen,

27:00.230 --> 27:02.620
big balls, tiny penis?

27:05.290 --> 27:07.870
What? No! God!

27:07.870 --> 27:09.620
Oh, God, stop it! No!

27:15.910 --> 27:16.910
AUTOMATED VOICE:  Goodbye.

27:36.020 --> 27:37.520
Balls.

27:39.020 --> 27:41.320
 You know, I swing them left
and I swing them right 

27:41.660 --> 27:43.660
COLIN: That's not my fault.

27:46.490 --> 27:47.830
I told you not
to put it there.

27:49.950 --> 27:51.360
Under the bed.

27:52.370 --> 27:53.170
Hi.

27:53.580 --> 27:55.080
Morning, 6-C.

27:55.590 --> 27:57.700
Hey, um,
I see that you have company,

27:57.700 --> 28:00.710
but I just want to ask you
a really quick question.

28:00.710 --> 28:02.710
Remember how you said
you were good at digging up dirt?

28:02.710 --> 28:06.510
Do you think that
maybe I could pay you to find some people for me?

28:06.510 --> 28:08.010
Sweetheart,
if I'm gonna help you,

28:08.010 --> 28:09.970
you got to give me
more info than that.

28:09.970 --> 28:12.220
Just some guys
that I've dated.

28:12.720 --> 28:14.940
Oh, you have herpes.
That's not a fun call to make.

28:14.940 --> 28:16.440
No, I...

28:16.440 --> 28:17.940
I don't know. I just...

28:17.940 --> 28:21.440
I think that one of these guys
might be worth a second look.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.240
No. I refuse to be
a part of this type of crazy.

28:33.740 --> 28:34.740
I don't know why
these guys broke up with you,

28:35.240 --> 28:36.990
and I need to protect them.

28:36.990 --> 28:39.880
Wait. Why do you assume
they all broke up with me?

28:39.880 --> 28:40.880
Because you seem
like the type of girl

28:41.380 --> 28:42.920
who tries to make
a bad thing work.

28:43.420 --> 28:44.880
Some people
call that optimism.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.890
I call it crazy.

28:46.890 --> 28:49.390
I'm sorry I asked.
I knew you'd be a jerk.

28:49.390 --> 28:51.970
Don't be mad.
It doesn't mean I won't sleep with you.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.480
Ugh! Gross.

29:09.410 --> 29:12.910
Colin! Colin, open up! Colin!

29:13.910 --> 29:16.420
Colin, we got to go!
Mom fell in the shower.

29:16.420 --> 29:18.790
What?
Yeah, she fell in the shower!

29:18.790 --> 29:20.290
Hi.

29:20.290 --> 29:24.290
She's at the hospital.
She's all wet.

29:25.290 --> 29:26.790
We got to get out of here!

29:26.790 --> 29:29.300
They're drying
her off right now, as we speak.

29:29.300 --> 29:32.720
I'm so sorry.
You seem like a really awesome person.

29:33.220 --> 29:35.220
I'm sure he's gonna call you,
but we got to go!

29:35.220 --> 29:37.470
Come on! She's hurt!

29:41.360 --> 29:42.860
Very impressive.

29:42.860 --> 29:44.860
Hmm.

29:44.860 --> 29:48.560
You help me
track down my exes, I'll help you escape yours.

29:48.570 --> 29:51.070
What happened to
protecting your sisters?

29:51.070 --> 29:54.290
If those girls
can't see you coming, they deserve what they get.

29:54.290 --> 29:56.160
Wow. Jesus.

29:56.160 --> 29:58.910
This place really goes
on and on, doesn't it?

30:00.210 --> 30:02.710
And you can use
my apartment to hide in.

30:04.960 --> 30:06.470
Here you go.
Thank you.

30:06.470 --> 30:08.970
Thanks, Diana. Okay.

30:08.970 --> 30:10.970
So, here's all the info
I have on the guys.

30:11.470 --> 30:12.890
Names, most recent
phone numbers...

30:13.390 --> 30:15.260
Hey! Addresses.

30:15.760 --> 30:19.560
Find out who's alive,
single, and still on the East Coast, okay?

30:19.560 --> 30:22.150
I'll take a car or a train,
but not a plane.

30:22.150 --> 30:25.650
I prioritized the list,
so start at the top.

30:25.650 --> 30:28.150
Jake Adams. Is that
the one that got away?

30:28.150 --> 30:30.160
Well, something like that.

30:30.160 --> 30:31.660
His dad's name
is also Jake Adams

30:31.660 --> 30:33.160
and he owns,
like, half of Boston.

30:33.160 --> 30:35.080
So, he should be
pretty easy to find.

30:35.080 --> 30:36.780
The Jake Adams?

30:36.780 --> 30:37.780
Well, he may not be
hard to find,

30:37.780 --> 30:39.500
but I guarantee
he's gonna be hard to get to.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.870
You don't have
a phone number or address or anything like that?

30:41.870 --> 30:43.870
If I had that,
I wouldn't need you.

30:43.870 --> 30:47.370
I do know that Tom Piper
is on the fast track to becoming a senator.

30:47.370 --> 30:49.880
Oh, and move John Kimble
up to number three.

30:49.880 --> 30:50.880
He probably still
works at Starbucks,

30:50.880 --> 30:52.960
but he's the best sex
I've ever had.

30:52.960 --> 30:54.850
You haven't had sex with me.

30:54.850 --> 30:57.850
No, but I have had sex
with other overly confident struggling musicians.

30:57.850 --> 30:58.850
So, I'm good.

30:59.350 --> 31:00.850
What makes you
think I'm a musician?

31:00.850 --> 31:03.860
Guitar in your apartment,
you dress like a horny teenager,

31:03.860 --> 31:06.230
I paid for that sandwich.
Struggling musician.

31:06.230 --> 31:08.230
So, I don't get it.
Why go through all this trouble?

31:08.230 --> 31:09.030
Why not just find a new guy?

31:09.450 --> 31:11.310
No. No new guys.

31:11.780 --> 31:13.280
New is always better than old.

31:13.280 --> 31:14.780
Of course you'd say that.

31:14.780 --> 31:17.700
I bet the longest relationship
you've ever had is with that sandwich.

31:23.910 --> 31:28.050
 What's it like for you
to fall asleep with all your thoughts?

31:30.380 --> 31:34.640
 Do you wake up blue?
Do you just sleep it off? 

31:34.920 --> 31:36.760
That's pretty.
I know.

31:36.760 --> 31:39.980
Are you really
gonna let us look good at your wedding?

31:39.980 --> 31:43.980
No. That's Mom's dress.
Those are the bridesmaids' dresses.

31:45.480 --> 31:46.730
Sorry. Mom picked them out,

31:46.730 --> 31:48.570
and I'm trying
to keep her happy

31:48.570 --> 31:50.240
because I invited
Dad to the wedding.

31:50.240 --> 31:51.740
Have you told Mom?

31:51.740 --> 31:53.110
No, not yet.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.110
Oh, wow!

31:57.110 --> 31:58.740
I think this is it, right?

32:01.330 --> 32:03.200
It's beautiful.

32:03.200 --> 32:05.200
Perfect.
I love it.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.450
That is a lot of poof.

32:07.450 --> 32:09.250
The poof is what
I like about it.

32:09.260 --> 32:11.590
But don't you want to have
wedding night sex with your dress still on?

32:11.590 --> 32:13.090
I don't know. Do I?

32:13.090 --> 32:14.790
Yeah, naughty bride,
you do.

32:14.790 --> 32:16.800
I'm just concerned
that with all those layers

32:16.800 --> 32:18.300
he's not gonna be
able to find your vagina.

32:18.800 --> 32:19.800
Good point.

32:19.800 --> 32:20.800
I mean, forget about 69.

32:20.800 --> 32:24.300
She's not gonna 69.

32:24.300 --> 32:25.310
Why not?

32:25.310 --> 32:27.110
Because she's a grown-up.

32:27.110 --> 32:28.970
Sixty-nines are
for when you're 17

32:28.980 --> 32:30.980
and you're trying
to cram everything in at once

32:30.980 --> 32:32.480
before your parents
get home.

32:32.480 --> 32:33.980
Thank you.

32:33.980 --> 32:35.480
Matt is always
trying to do that,

32:35.480 --> 32:37.700
and I say,
"Let's just take turns.

32:37.700 --> 32:39.700
"What's the rush?"

32:39.700 --> 32:41.700
Oh, my God.
He found Dave Hansen.

32:41.700 --> 32:43.910
Wait. Are you tracking down
all your ex-boyfriends

32:43.910 --> 32:46.410
so you don't
have to go over 20?

32:46.410 --> 32:47.660
What?
Think about it.

32:47.660 --> 32:49.500
If it works out
with one of these guys,

32:49.500 --> 32:51.500
that means a whole
period of my life won't have been a waste.

32:51.800 --> 32:53.380
Yeah, but it didn't work out
with any of those guys

32:53.670 --> 32:55.470
because they were
all wrong for you.

32:55.470 --> 32:58.390
Dave Hansen. Isn't that
the magician you dated?

33:04.090 --> 33:06.430
I believe this is yours.

33:14.100 --> 33:16.110
I believe these are yours.

33:20.690 --> 33:23.080
Wow! You work fast!

33:23.080 --> 33:25.920
This one was easy.
He has his own website,

33:25.920 --> 33:27.500
supersexymagic.com.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.670
Well, I'm sure I'll
be able to find him.

33:31.670 --> 33:34.760
So, you can scoot
and skedaddle.

33:34.760 --> 33:36.090
And miss the show?

33:43.380 --> 33:44.770
Okay.

33:47.970 --> 33:50.470
Nope, I'm done here.

33:50.470 --> 33:51.690
That's it?

33:53.810 --> 33:56.310
Why? Because
he's a bartender?

33:56.310 --> 33:58.310
No, because he's
still a bartender.

33:58.310 --> 34:00.320
He's exactly where
he was nine years ago,

34:00.320 --> 34:04.820
an out-of-work magician
who sleeps till noon, bartends till 3:00,

34:04.820 --> 34:06.820
and goes around
pulling money out of people.

34:06.820 --> 34:08.320
He keeps your quarter,
by the way.

34:08.320 --> 34:11.830
So what?
You could have had some fun for old times' sake.

34:11.830 --> 34:13.830
No. You know,
even if it didn't raise my number,

34:13.830 --> 34:16.330
I can't afford to
waste any more time on guys like him.

34:16.830 --> 34:18.330
Wait, wait, wait.
That's what this is about?

34:18.330 --> 34:20.840
You don't want to
raise your number!

34:20.840 --> 34:23.340
That's why you
won't sleep with me.

34:23.340 --> 34:26.840
No, there's a lot of reasons
why I won't sleep with you.

34:27.340 --> 34:28.760
No, there's not.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.260
I don't know why
girls care so much about their number anyway.

34:31.260 --> 34:34.900
You guys all
have this ideal girl in your minds

34:34.900 --> 34:38.909
and if our number
gets too high, we can't be that girl.

34:38.909 --> 34:41.409
The ideal girl.
Tell me about her.

34:41.409 --> 34:43.909
You know,
you can take her home to the family,

34:43.909 --> 34:45.909
she's smart,
but not smarter than you,

34:45.909 --> 34:48.409
and she bakes apple pies
with your mom

34:48.409 --> 34:49.920
and plays catch
with your handicapped sister,

34:50.420 --> 34:52.420
but then when you're alone,
she's takes off her glasses

34:52.420 --> 34:54.920
and puts on a vinyl cat suit
and fucks you sideways!

34:54.920 --> 34:57.420
That girl doesn't exist.
If she did, I'd be sleeping with her.

34:57.420 --> 34:58.920
And what kind of guy
cares about

34:58.930 --> 35:01.430
how many people you've
slept with anyway?

35:01.430 --> 35:02.930
Decent guys.

35:26.370 --> 35:29.710
Hey! What are you doing?

35:31.120 --> 35:32.130
Waiting for

35:33.630 --> 35:35.130
Amy to leave.

35:35.130 --> 35:38.050
You hooked up with
someone last night after I left you?

35:38.050 --> 35:40.300
Hooking up sounds so crass.

35:40.300 --> 35:43.300
We shared
a romantic experience.

35:43.300 --> 35:45.300
And then I told her
I had an early dentist appointment,

35:45.300 --> 35:48.310
and I'm hiding on your
couch till she leaves.

35:48.310 --> 35:52.640
Well, maybe you
could use this downtime to do some actual work.

35:53.150 --> 35:55.900
I am working. I set up
a Facebook account for you.

35:56.270 --> 35:59.600
I don't want
to be on Facebook. What picture did you use?

35:59.600 --> 36:01.490
The one I just took
of you sleeping.

36:01.490 --> 36:02.990
I think this is
gonna be better.

36:02.990 --> 36:04.660
While you're looking for them,
they can be looking for you.

36:04.660 --> 36:06.410
Fine, but I refuse to tweet.

36:06.410 --> 36:07.410
Ooh!

36:07.910 --> 36:10.910
Number 14, Evan Slater,
has friend-requested you.

36:10.910 --> 36:12.700
He's tagged you in a photo

36:12.700 --> 36:16.280
and he's suggested
you become a fan of Tito's Tacos.

36:16.290 --> 36:18.290
Ooh. I liked Evan.

36:18.290 --> 36:20.790
Yeah, and who
doesn't like tacos?

36:20.790 --> 36:22.680
He's adorable.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.350
And so are his wife and kids.

36:28.710 --> 36:31.220
Well, he clearly
doesn't understand what Facebook is for.

36:31.220 --> 36:33.440
You know, if you don't start
taking this job more seriously,

36:33.440 --> 36:35.940
you're fired from
using my apartment.

36:36.940 --> 36:37.940
Where's my coffee pot?

36:37.940 --> 36:39.890
I broke it.

36:39.890 --> 36:41.690
If you were on Twitter,
you'd know that already.

36:46.530 --> 36:48.950
You owe me $19.95.

36:48.950 --> 36:50.950
How about I pay you back
in Chinese food?

36:50.950 --> 36:52.240
I ordered Charlie Chiang.

36:52.240 --> 36:54.040
Did you get
the itty-bitty spare ribs?

36:55.540 --> 36:57.040
Okay, I'll be there
in five minutes.

36:58.490 --> 36:59.330
Hey.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.300
Hey, come on in.

37:08.800 --> 37:10.840
Wow.
Yeah.

37:10.840 --> 37:12.840
Dad didn't take me
to too many ball games,

37:12.840 --> 37:15.310
but we did go on
a lot of stakeouts.

37:15.310 --> 37:16.680
It's impressive.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.980
COLIN: Okay, so Mike Miller
and Eric Hamilton are married.

37:21.980 --> 37:25.240
So is Valerio,
the guy from Italy.

37:25.240 --> 37:26.610
Ew.
Plum sauce?

37:26.610 --> 37:28.110
Yes, please, but no mustard.

37:28.110 --> 37:30.580
No mustard?
Mustard's the best part.

37:30.580 --> 37:32.910
Not if you hate mustard.

37:32.910 --> 37:34.780
Anything on
Jake Adams yet?

37:34.780 --> 37:36.280
No. I'm sorry.

37:36.280 --> 37:38.780
I told you,
rich people are very good at protecting their privacy,

37:38.780 --> 37:40.750
but just be patient,
we'll find him.

37:40.750 --> 37:42.760
What about Simon Forester?

37:42.760 --> 37:44.760
He's separated
and his house just went on the market,

37:44.760 --> 37:47.260
so I'm guessing a divorce
is right around the corner.

37:47.760 --> 37:50.260
Huh. Okay.
Let's try Simon.

37:50.260 --> 37:51.930
Simon.

37:51.930 --> 37:55.720
Okay, so what's my plan?
Guy getting a divorce.

37:56.550 --> 37:57.300
Divorce...

37:59.640 --> 38:01.140
I could find out
who his lawyer is

38:01.140 --> 38:03.110
and get a job there
as his assistant.

38:03.110 --> 38:07.400
Or we keep it simple
and you just go look at his open house.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.200
Huh.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.150
The challenge with
a newly divorced guy

38:12.150 --> 38:13.650
is that he's just
looking to have fun.

38:13.650 --> 38:15.660
What you got to do
is give him the best sex of his life.

38:15.660 --> 38:18.570
He can't realize that he's
falling in love with you until it's too late.

38:18.710 --> 38:22.460
So, I'm covering up the fact
that I'm marriage material with amazing sex?

38:22.460 --> 38:24.800
Yeah. How's your blowjob?

38:24.800 --> 38:26.130
What?

38:26.130 --> 38:28.250
Relax. This is business.
I'm trying to help you.

38:28.250 --> 38:30.750
Well, if you must know,
it's pretty good.

38:30.750 --> 38:32.760
It's the hand job
I haven't quite figured out yet.

38:32.760 --> 38:36.140
Well, I guarantee you
he has, so skip it.

38:36.140 --> 38:38.640
All right,
I guess this is it.

38:38.640 --> 38:39.650
Ready?
Yeah.

38:41.650 --> 38:45.150
This is nice.
Simon's doing well.

38:45.150 --> 38:47.650
I wonder where
the realtor is.

38:48.150 --> 38:49.160
Hello?

38:54.440 --> 38:55.830
Is that...

38:57.330 --> 38:58.830
What the...

38:58.830 --> 39:00.120
Donald!
Ally!

39:00.120 --> 39:01.780
What the fuck are
you doing in my home?

39:02.790 --> 39:04.290
Uh...

39:04.290 --> 39:08.540
The door was open,
so I just assumed this was the open house.

39:08.540 --> 39:12.550
No. No. This is my house.
You're in my home.

39:13.050 --> 39:13.960
Oh, well...

39:15.970 --> 39:19.470
My fiance, Pierre, and I
are looking to buy a place

39:20.470 --> 39:23.470
when he gets back
from the North Pole.

39:23.470 --> 39:26.890
Hey, Ally, can I go ahead
and get that picture back from you?

39:28.310 --> 39:31.310
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oops.

39:46.630 --> 39:48.630
That was Disgusting Donald.

39:48.630 --> 39:49.630
He didn't look disgusting.

39:49.630 --> 39:52.420
He was disgusting
when I dated him, okay?

39:56.720 --> 39:58.090
Oh, my God,
there's Simon.

39:58.560 --> 40:01.560
He looks good for a guy
going through a divorce.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.770
Before you take my order,

40:10.770 --> 40:15.270
I do feel compelled to explain
why a single, straight man

40:15.270 --> 40:17.780
is having high tea by himself
on Beacon Hill.

40:17.780 --> 40:19.780
Well, um,

40:19.780 --> 40:23.280
I'm just so homesick
that I'd kill for anything English.

40:31.170 --> 40:33.180
Okay, so go.
I can take it from here.

40:33.180 --> 40:34.510
Don't shove me.
Get out of here.

40:34.510 --> 40:36.380
Don't shove me.

40:36.380 --> 40:38.930
Get out of here!
Hey! I said don't shove me!

40:38.930 --> 40:40.220
Ally Darling?

40:41.430 --> 40:42.800
Is that you?

40:45.300 --> 40:47.270
Simon, I can't believe it.

40:48.310 --> 40:50.110
What are the chances?

40:51.780 --> 40:53.310
It's brilliant to see you.

40:53.310 --> 40:55.310
It is brilliant.

40:55.820 --> 41:00.320
Simon,
this is my neighbor, Colin. But he has to go now.

41:00.320 --> 41:01.820
No, I don't.

41:01.820 --> 41:04.040
Pleasure.
No, no, the pleasure's all mine.

41:05.410 --> 41:07.130
Wow.

41:07.130 --> 41:09.130
Wow. It's great to see...

41:09.130 --> 41:10.960
Did you look this good
when we were dating?

41:10.960 --> 41:14.500
Oh, well,
I had a fringe back then.

41:14.500 --> 41:17.000
That's bangs.
"Fringe" is "bangs."

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Americans.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.510
Listen, they're
showing my house,

41:20.510 --> 41:22.170
so I've got to disappear
for an hour or so,

41:22.170 --> 41:23.510
but do you fancy
grabbing a pint?

41:24.930 --> 41:26.260
Smashing.

41:27.230 --> 41:28.760
Cheerio, Colin.

41:28.760 --> 41:31.020
How are you fancying
driving on the right?

41:31.900 --> 41:34.150
Cross Simon off the list.

41:34.940 --> 41:36.440
What happened?

41:36.440 --> 41:39.440
My British accent
was a little rusty, and halfway through darts

41:39.440 --> 41:41.190
I started sounding
like Eliza Doolittle.

41:43.700 --> 41:46.000
Don't take your eye
off the board.

41:47.080 --> 41:51.340
No. Straight.
Just... Higher. Better.

41:53.460 --> 41:57.460
Bloody 'ell! I'm rubbish at this.

42:02.300 --> 42:04.770
You were saying
you got sacked.

42:05.270 --> 42:08.640
Yep. Losing me job
wasn't the end of the world.

42:09.140 --> 42:11.140
Still got me mates
and a roof over me 'ead.

42:11.140 --> 42:14.980
I don't need much,
just a room somewhere,

42:14.980 --> 42:19.310
far away from
the cold night air.

42:22.120 --> 42:24.120
And then when I tried
to pull out of it,

42:24.120 --> 42:27.410
for some reason I panicked
and went full Borat.

42:27.820 --> 42:31.330
So, I order another round?

42:33.330 --> 42:37.250
No. No, I think we
better call it a night.

42:37.250 --> 42:41.750
Oh, no! I talk whole time.
I know nothing about you.

42:45.060 --> 42:49.060
So, what's next for Svorgon?

42:54.020 --> 42:55.320
Svorgon?

42:55.320 --> 42:58.190
I turned into the Swedish Chef
from  The Muppets.

42:58.190 --> 42:59.190
He was my favorite.

42:59.190 --> 43:02.690
Okay.
Who else we got?

43:06.360 --> 43:08.000
I thought we weren't
allowed up here.

43:08.500 --> 43:09.500
Didn't you get that memo?

43:09.500 --> 43:11.280
I wrote that memo.

43:11.280 --> 43:12.280
It was getting
kind of crowded,

43:12.790 --> 43:13.790
and my band and I
practice up here.

43:14.290 --> 43:16.290
Where does
your band play?

43:16.290 --> 43:18.290
Here, for now.

43:18.790 --> 43:21.290
My mom's friend is
looking for a band for her son's bar mitzvah.

43:21.290 --> 43:24.300
No, thank you.
We're not that kind of band.

43:24.300 --> 43:25.960
The kind that makes money?

43:26.470 --> 43:27.970
Let's drop it.

43:27.970 --> 43:30.190
We got 10 possibilities left.

43:30.190 --> 43:34.190
Jay from Club Med Turkoise.
I'm trying, but I need more info.

43:34.190 --> 43:36.190
I'm sorry,
it was spring break.

43:36.190 --> 43:38.190
Jay may not even
be his real name.

43:38.190 --> 43:40.780
I'm certainly not
Kelli with an "I."

43:40.780 --> 43:42.280
Barrett Ingold,
lives in Miami.

43:42.780 --> 43:45.780
I know it's not
geographically desirable, but he is a doctor now.

43:45.780 --> 43:47.700
Don't care. I hate Miami.

43:48.200 --> 43:49.200
I think too much sun
makes people stupid.

43:50.920 --> 43:52.800
Okay. How do you feel
about Denver?

43:52.800 --> 43:54.300
I found the mountain man,

43:54.300 --> 43:56.300
and that guy
has got a caboose worth relocating for.

43:56.300 --> 43:59.300
Pass! He always wanted
to breathe fresh air.

43:59.300 --> 44:00.300
Do you know how
exhausting it was

44:00.300 --> 44:01.300
to pretend to
enjoy the outdoors

44:01.800 --> 44:03.010
with that kind of enthusiasm?

44:03.010 --> 44:05.010
More exhausting
than pretending to be British?

44:05.010 --> 44:06.560
I never had to wipe
myself with a leaf

44:06.560 --> 44:07.560
when I was pretending
to be British.

44:07.560 --> 44:10.230
Touche.
What about Gerry Perry?

44:10.230 --> 44:12.010
He's a puppeteer,
so he's single.

44:13.020 --> 44:15.020
I don't want to go out
with Gerry Perry.

44:15.020 --> 44:17.020
Where's Jake Adams?

44:17.020 --> 44:18.520
In Noyaradougou.

44:18.520 --> 44:20.160
What? Where the hell's that?

44:20.160 --> 44:21.660
Africa.

44:21.660 --> 44:23.660
He runs his family's
philanthropic foundation

44:23.660 --> 44:27.160
and he's overseeing
the construction of a school there.

44:30.170 --> 44:32.590
Is he ever coming back?

44:32.590 --> 44:35.620
Eventually. In the meantime,
I've got Gerry Perry.

44:35.620 --> 44:36.620
No!

44:38.590 --> 44:41.590
All right, so the puppet
show starts at 2:00, and I'll meet you at the park.

44:42.090 --> 44:43.600
Okay.

44:43.600 --> 44:44.550
Hey, Colin.

44:44.550 --> 44:46.050
Yeah?

44:46.050 --> 44:48.430
Thank you for
all your hard work, by the way.

44:48.930 --> 44:50.940
I really appreciate it.

44:50.940 --> 44:52.270
You do?

44:52.270 --> 44:54.110
Because sometimes,
it's hard to tell.

44:55.020 --> 44:56.030
Really?

44:57.030 --> 44:58.280
Oh...

45:06.570 --> 45:08.040
What are you doing?

45:08.040 --> 45:10.540
Trying to end
the night with a bang.

45:12.160 --> 45:13.660
You really can't
hang out with a girl

45:13.660 --> 45:15.160
without sleeping
with her, can you?

45:16.630 --> 45:19.630
Well, I can,
it's just not that much fun.

45:23.640 --> 45:25.640
You're not on my list.

45:29.140 --> 45:32.140
You could just
cross off the dead guy,

45:32.140 --> 45:34.600
put my name on there.

45:39.490 --> 45:41.320
GERRY AS PUPPET:
Who did the poop?

45:41.320 --> 45:42.740
ALL: You did the poop!

45:43.240 --> 45:44.240
Hey.
Hey.

45:46.240 --> 45:47.240
Whose kid is this?

45:47.240 --> 45:48.330
He's my nephew.

45:48.830 --> 45:50.330
If I'd shown up
to the puppet show without a child,

45:50.330 --> 45:52.330
it might be creepy.

45:52.330 --> 45:53.330
Great. Huh.

45:53.330 --> 45:54.830
Can you say hi,
Justin?

45:54.830 --> 45:55.840
Arr!

45:55.840 --> 45:57.340
He's a pirate.

45:57.340 --> 45:59.590
GERRY AS PUPPET:
What are you talking about?

46:04.710 --> 46:05.710
All right, you're up.

46:06.710 --> 46:07.850
Great.

46:07.850 --> 46:08.850
Come on.

46:11.100 --> 46:12.600
Thanks, Gerry.

46:12.600 --> 46:14.440
You're welcome.

46:26.650 --> 46:28.480
Daisy home?

46:30.450 --> 46:31.950
No.

46:57.650 --> 46:59.980
So, when do you think
Daisy will be home?

47:06.240 --> 47:07.740
Gerry?
Ally?

47:07.740 --> 47:09.240
Oh, my God,
what are you doing here?

47:09.240 --> 47:10.740
Hi. Oh,

47:10.740 --> 47:14.200
you know, I'm just
babysitting for a friend.

47:14.200 --> 47:16.330
Ah, cool.
So, you saw the magical show.

47:16.830 --> 47:19.580
Yeah! Wow, the kids,
they just love it.

47:19.870 --> 47:21.870
That's just because
I say "poop" a lot.

47:23.510 --> 47:24.510
Hey, so,

47:26.590 --> 47:27.960
recognize this bad boy?

47:27.960 --> 47:29.710
Hey there, Smart Alec.

47:29.710 --> 47:30.710
Hi.

47:33.680 --> 47:36.350
So, how are you?

47:36.350 --> 47:38.390
Quit being a pussy,
and ask her about Daisy.

47:38.390 --> 47:41.440
What? Come on, man,
don't be rude.

47:41.440 --> 47:44.730
You are rude.
Sorry about that.

47:44.730 --> 47:47.730
That's okay. Uh...
I'm great.

47:47.730 --> 47:50.480
Great, great.
Well, you look great.

47:50.950 --> 47:53.120
Not as great as Daisy.

47:53.120 --> 47:54.490
Ignore him.

47:56.460 --> 47:58.460
Hey, but seriously,

47:58.460 --> 48:01.990
maybe we should
exchange numbers, you know, and catch up.

48:02.490 --> 48:04.800
You know what?
I think I'm all caught up.

48:04.800 --> 48:06.300
Cool!

48:06.300 --> 48:08.500
But it was really great
running into you.

48:08.830 --> 48:10.340
Great running into you.

48:10.340 --> 48:11.840
No, it wasn't.

48:11.840 --> 48:12.840
Big mouth.

48:13.340 --> 48:15.810
Okay, I'll see you around.

48:19.810 --> 48:21.310
Hey, Daisy.

48:21.810 --> 48:22.820
Hey.

48:35.860 --> 48:37.110
Daisy...

48:43.000 --> 48:46.010
I can't believe
I slept with that guy.

48:46.010 --> 48:48.010
Where's Justin?

48:48.010 --> 48:49.510
This is Justin.

48:50.010 --> 48:51.010
That's not Justin.

48:52.460 --> 48:54.380
What's the matter with you?

48:54.380 --> 48:55.380
Didn't your mom teach you
to not walk off with strangers?

48:55.880 --> 48:57.380
What's the matter
with you?

48:57.380 --> 48:59.390
You didn't realize you had
a completely different human being?

48:59.390 --> 49:00.850
Justin!

49:00.850 --> 49:04.190
Okay. What does
your mommy look like?

49:04.190 --> 49:05.190
Like you.

49:05.190 --> 49:07.390
Lucas! Get back here!

49:10.360 --> 49:11.700
Wait. Wait.

49:13.620 --> 49:16.900
Do you really think
I look like your mommy? Huh?

49:17.740 --> 49:19.790
Answer me!

49:19.790 --> 49:21.160
Answer me, Lucas!

49:22.160 --> 49:23.990
Lucas!

49:27.080 --> 49:30.080
No disappearing acts,
buddy.

49:30.080 --> 49:34.590
Okay, I am not
buying you any more food until you find Jake Adams.

49:34.590 --> 49:36.590
If he was so perfect,
why didn't it work out in the first place?

49:38.590 --> 49:41.090
Well, we made this pact
that we would lose our virginity to each other,

49:41.090 --> 49:44.100
but Jake went abroad
junior year, and while he was gone,

49:44.600 --> 49:46.100
I broke the pact.

49:46.100 --> 49:47.600
With who?

49:47.600 --> 49:50.100
Which one of the 20
could have possibly been better than Jake Adams?

49:50.100 --> 49:51.600
And why aren't
we looking for him?

49:51.600 --> 49:53.440
You already found him.

49:53.440 --> 49:54.910
Gerry Perry?

49:55.410 --> 49:57.410
You lost your virginity
to the puppeteer?

49:58.910 --> 50:02.920
I know. I felt bad for him.

50:02.920 --> 50:06.420
Oh, Ally,
I underestimated you. That's amazing.

50:06.420 --> 50:09.750
That's... That's my
new favorite thing about you.

50:10.670 --> 50:12.680
Hi. Thank you.

50:14.680 --> 50:15.680
Hey.
Hi.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.180
Is Eddie coming?

50:17.180 --> 50:18.680
No. Mom. Don't go.

50:21.100 --> 50:22.890
I can't have lunch with Mom.
I didn't wash my hair.

50:22.890 --> 50:24.890
You can't even tell.
It looks great.

50:24.890 --> 50:26.390
You haven't told Mom
Dad's coming to the wedding, have you?

50:27.690 --> 50:28.810
No.

50:28.810 --> 50:29.780
And that's why I'm here.

50:29.780 --> 50:30.700
Yes.

50:30.700 --> 50:32.650
And my hair
doesn't look that great?

50:32.650 --> 50:34.870
No. I can't tell her alone.

50:35.700 --> 50:38.950
Fine. Pass the butter.

50:38.960 --> 50:40.460
(HUMMING  THE WEDDING MARCH)
Hi, Mummy.

50:41.910 --> 50:42.910
Hi, Mom.

50:42.910 --> 50:46.130
Kitty. Oh, my.

50:46.630 --> 50:48.830
So, the caterer called.

50:48.830 --> 50:52.840
Um, how strict a vegetarian
is your boyfriend Rick, honey?

50:53.340 --> 50:56.010
Would he be willing to eat
just a little chicken for one night?

50:56.010 --> 50:57.510
No, Rick's not coming.
They broke up.

50:58.010 --> 51:00.390
Daisy!
What? Not again.

51:00.390 --> 51:01.890
Dad's coming to the wedding.
What?

51:02.350 --> 51:03.850
Ally!

51:05.560 --> 51:07.730
How could you do this to me?

51:07.730 --> 51:10.350
I'm not doing
anything to you, Mom.

51:10.850 --> 51:13.860
Except making it impossible
for me to come.

51:13.860 --> 51:15.360
You're not gonna
come to my wedding?

51:15.360 --> 51:18.860
Not if your
father's coming, I'm not.

51:19.360 --> 51:21.700
Maybe he can be
Allison's date. Hmm?

51:21.700 --> 51:25.330
I'm sure you will just have
a lovely, lovely time.

51:25.330 --> 51:27.340
Bye, Mom. Bye.
Bye, Mom.

51:28.340 --> 51:29.340
You have to fix this.

51:29.840 --> 51:30.840
I'll talk to her
when I get back.

51:30.840 --> 51:32.090
Where are you going?

51:32.090 --> 51:34.090
Miami, for a Pap smear.

51:34.090 --> 51:35.090
Why?

51:35.090 --> 51:36.600
Do you remember
Barrett Ingold?

51:36.600 --> 51:38.100
The guy who threw up
in our dishwasher?

51:38.100 --> 51:40.100
Yeah.
He's a gynecologist now.

51:40.100 --> 51:41.430
But you hate Miami.

51:41.430 --> 51:43.800
I know. But I'm not having
as much luck as I'd hoped locally

51:43.800 --> 51:46.360
and I'm running out of time,
money, and viable eggs.

51:46.360 --> 51:48.940
So, you're telling me
that tracking down your ex-boyfriends

51:48.940 --> 51:52.440
is more important
than helping me plan my wedding?

51:52.450 --> 51:54.950
I know it
sounds stupid to you, but it is important.

51:54.950 --> 51:57.950
I feel like everyone else
is moving on with their lives but me.

51:57.950 --> 52:00.950
Ally, I'm all for
moving on, I really am,

52:00.950 --> 52:04.960
but it just feels like
this quest you're on is a little nuts.

52:04.960 --> 52:06.460
You know what?

52:06.460 --> 52:07.960
If you hadn't given
your ex-boyfriend a second chance,

52:07.960 --> 52:09.460
you wouldn't even
be having a wedding.

52:09.460 --> 52:13.470
Besides, I need a Pap smear
and he takes my insurance.

52:13.470 --> 52:14.830
I'm late for my spray tan.

52:33.740 --> 52:35.240
Hello, Allison.

52:37.190 --> 52:39.190
Barrett?

52:39.190 --> 52:42.580
Oh, my God, is that you?

52:44.080 --> 52:44.950
Hi.

52:46.420 --> 52:49.420
It's Ally. Ally Darling.

52:49.420 --> 52:51.750
Oh. Yeah, from spinning.

52:52.170 --> 52:53.590
No.

52:53.590 --> 52:55.790
From...
Oh, Greg's birthday party.

52:55.790 --> 52:58.090
We went to college together.

52:59.930 --> 53:01.510
We dated.
Oh.

53:03.020 --> 53:04.380
How about that?

53:04.380 --> 53:06.800
Well, that was
a long time ago.

53:06.800 --> 53:10.140
So, let's see how
things are going now. Can you scooch?

53:11.110 --> 53:12.110
Very good.

53:21.280 --> 53:24.290
Ally! Of course.

53:27.870 --> 53:30.380
He recognized my vagina!

53:30.740 --> 53:34.710
What's going on down there?
I got to say, I'm a little freaked out.

53:34.710 --> 53:36.210
Well, I'd be happy to
take a look for you.

53:36.220 --> 53:38.920
I used
all my miles for that!

53:38.920 --> 53:40.920
Cross Barrett off the list!

53:40.920 --> 53:42.920
You know what?
Cross the list off the list!

53:42.920 --> 53:44.470
What am I doing?

53:44.470 --> 53:47.560
Unemployed,
spending every last dime

53:47.560 --> 53:49.060
trying to track down
these assholes

53:49.060 --> 53:51.560
who already broke up
with me once.

53:52.060 --> 53:54.070
Maybe I should just quit.

53:54.570 --> 53:57.570
Well, that's too bad,
'cause I found Tom Piper.

53:58.070 --> 53:59.570
Keep talking.

53:59.570 --> 54:01.070
He's in D.C.,
like you said.

54:01.070 --> 54:02.570
He's working as an aide
for Senator Mitchell.

54:07.610 --> 54:09.110
I don't have anything
a politician's wife would wear.

54:09.120 --> 54:10.120
Ooh!

54:10.120 --> 54:13.120
I do have a store credit
for Ann Taylor. Ha!

54:13.950 --> 54:15.450
Hi.

54:15.450 --> 54:17.460
DAISY:  I'm on your street
and I have to poo.

54:17.460 --> 54:20.460
Okay, let yourself in,
I'll be home in 10 minutes.

54:22.710 --> 54:24.550
Hi.

54:26.020 --> 54:27.020
Hey.

54:27.020 --> 54:28.720
Oh, Jesus.

54:28.720 --> 54:31.520
Tell me you're not
naked on my couch next to my sister.

54:31.520 --> 54:34.520
Thankfully,
he doesn't like to play without his underwear.

54:34.520 --> 54:36.530
The guitar gets cold
against his penis.

54:37.030 --> 54:39.950
So, you two have met.

54:39.950 --> 54:41.950
Hey, remember Tom Piper?

54:42.450 --> 54:45.450
Colin found him in D.C.,
so I'm going there tomorrow,

54:46.450 --> 54:48.240
wearing this!

54:48.240 --> 54:49.740
I'm so excited.

54:49.740 --> 54:51.240
Then why would
you wear a pantsuit?

54:51.240 --> 54:53.740
Don't you have your interview
at Sheffield and Bloom tomorrow?

54:53.740 --> 54:55.490
That's the beauty of
a pantsuit, you know.

54:55.490 --> 54:58.160
It works for both
a super-boring interview

54:58.160 --> 55:02.050
and for an accidental,
on-purpose encounter with my future husband.

55:02.050 --> 55:04.720
Hey, did you ever try and sell
those freaky little sculptures you make?

55:04.720 --> 55:05.720
No, she needs
a real job.

55:05.720 --> 55:07.720
Oh, yeah,
those are just a hobby.

55:08.220 --> 55:09.260
COLIN: I think
they're amazing.

55:09.260 --> 55:11.090
You should try.
Not everyone can do that, you know.

55:12.600 --> 55:13.980
Excuse me,
would you mind giving me and Ally

55:13.980 --> 55:14.980
a little bit of privacy,
please?

55:16.620 --> 55:17.350
She has to poo.

55:17.820 --> 55:19.860
Ally!

55:19.860 --> 55:22.190
Hey, hasn't your
lady friend left yet?

55:22.190 --> 55:24.690
No, I guess this one's
a late sleeper.

55:24.690 --> 55:26.200
Wait. Are you...

55:26.200 --> 55:29.360
Is he hiding out here
because there's a woman in his apartment?

55:29.370 --> 55:30.870
He is.

55:30.870 --> 55:33.170
That's it. I'm going
to Anthony's Bakery. Excuse me.

55:33.450 --> 55:36.840
Do you want to
grab me a cannoli? No?

55:37.840 --> 55:40.430
Okay. Keys.

55:54.720 --> 55:56.230
Who the hell are you?

55:56.230 --> 55:57.530
Andrea.

55:58.950 --> 56:00.950
He didn't tell you
he was engaged?

56:01.400 --> 56:03.900
No. I am so sorry.

56:04.400 --> 56:07.570
When I told him I was engaged,
he didn't say anything.

56:12.880 --> 56:14.960
Why?

56:14.960 --> 56:16.960
Tits!

56:16.960 --> 56:19.470
Oh. Oh.

56:20.470 --> 56:23.970
Oh. Why? Why?

56:33.600 --> 56:36.100
Hey, wouldn't it be easier

56:36.100 --> 56:38.600
if you just spent the night
at their apartments

56:38.600 --> 56:41.100
and left in the morning,
like a normal guy?

56:41.100 --> 56:42.600
No.

56:42.610 --> 56:44.110
I once stayed in
a relationship with a girl

56:44.110 --> 56:46.940
because of a picture she had
on her bedside table.

56:46.940 --> 56:50.450
It was her
dressed as Cinderella on her fifth birthday.

56:51.950 --> 56:53.280
Grab that.

56:53.280 --> 56:55.280
So?

56:55.280 --> 56:57.790
So, every time I tried
to split with her,

56:57.790 --> 56:59.790
I'd picture that little
girl in the blue dress.

56:59.790 --> 57:03.290
Happy. Excited about Monty,
her new gerbil,

57:03.790 --> 57:07.130
who she would later kill
by accidentally putting him in the dryer.

57:12.940 --> 57:15.220
Just couldn't break
that little girl's heart.

57:19.560 --> 57:21.060
So you're saying
it's easier to sleep with girls

57:21.060 --> 57:22.060
and never call them again

57:22.060 --> 57:25.060
if you don't know
anything about them?

57:26.700 --> 57:28.280
Kind of like a serial killer.

57:30.650 --> 57:32.150
Yeah, I guess so.

57:32.570 --> 57:34.570
Hmm.

57:34.960 --> 57:36.410
COLIN ON PHONE:
Hey, so I talked to Piper's assistant.

57:36.410 --> 57:37.910
He said he's gonna
be doing research

57:37.910 --> 57:39.410
in the library of
the Adams Building

57:39.410 --> 57:40.750
for the rest of the day.

57:41.160 --> 57:44.170
Oh, wait. Hold on.
My leg fell asleep on the train.

57:44.170 --> 57:46.550
Pins and needles.
Pins and needles.

57:47.050 --> 57:48.050
Punch it.

57:48.050 --> 57:49.060
Really?

57:51.560 --> 57:53.560
I'm punching.

57:53.560 --> 57:57.350
What? Your leg's
never fallen asleep before?

57:59.400 --> 58:00.150
What's that sound?

58:01.020 --> 58:02.350
Nothing.

58:02.850 --> 58:05.350
Hey, I didn't know
you were such a big fan of Lionel Richie.

58:05.350 --> 58:09.740
You know, looking at
somebody's playlist is like reading their diary.

58:15.780 --> 58:16.670
That's my bathtub.

58:22.510 --> 58:23.760
Donald.

58:23.760 --> 58:27.010
Ally...
What are you doing here?

58:28.790 --> 58:30.600
Visiting my fiance.

58:31.600 --> 58:34.100
Your fiance who was
at the North Pole?

58:34.100 --> 58:34.970
Yep.

58:35.430 --> 58:37.940
He's back. Pierre is back.

58:38.270 --> 58:40.720
Wow. Pierre just happens
to be in Washington, D.C.,

58:40.720 --> 58:42.220
the same time that
I have a conference?

58:43.730 --> 58:47.030
Yep. He's meeting
with the President.

58:47.030 --> 58:48.400
Oh. What a coincidence.

58:48.400 --> 58:50.870
I know.
It's crazy, isn't it?

58:51.780 --> 58:53.070
Yeah, it is.

58:54.900 --> 58:57.410
That's exactly what it is.

58:57.410 --> 58:58.710
Okay.

59:27.690 --> 59:29.190
Do you like freedom?

59:29.190 --> 59:30.190
Sign here for freedom.

59:30.190 --> 59:31.690
Be on our mailing list
for George Bush.

59:31.690 --> 59:34.690
George W. Bush.
Vote George Bush.

59:34.690 --> 59:35.690
Get on our mailing list.

59:36.200 --> 59:37.080
Vote for freedom.

59:59.310 --> 01:00:01.010
No, no, no. It's taken.

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:03.010
It's taken.

01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:13.350
Okay, excuse me.

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:16.490
I'm just wondering

01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:19.660
if you could help me
move the table about three feet this way?

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:22.360
I just...
I like it better over there.

01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:27.330
Great, keep going just a little further.

01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:32.120
Go, team.
That's fantastic work. Thank you. Almost.

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:36.710
Almost.
Almost there. Okay.

01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:38.460
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.440
Ally Darling.

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.360
Tom?

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.860
Shh!

01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:56.560
Oh, my God!
He's taking me to this party tonight.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.860
I offered to stay
at the Best Western,

01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:59.870
but he insisted
on putting me up at the Omni.

01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:01.570
COLIN:  He dropped you
off at the hotel

01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:04.070
and didn't come up
for "it's good to see you" sex?

01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:05.540
What'd you do to turn him off?

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:06.910
Nothing. He's a gentleman.

01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:09.210
You wore that pantsuit,
didn't you?

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:12.710
That pantsuit is sexy.
It's very Katharine Hepburn.

01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:14.330
All right. Let's clear
something up right now.

01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:16.830
Katharine Hepburn
was not sexy. Audrey Hepburn was sexy.

01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:18.080
Katharine Hepburn was a dude.

01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:22.640
Well, Tom is just a good guy.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.760
Besides,
you wouldn't know a gentleman if he tiptoed up behind you

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.140
and tickled your balls.

01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:30.930
Hello. Thank you.

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:35.320
I just got a present.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.820
Oh!

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:42.330
He just sent over
the most beautiful dress I've ever seen!

01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:45.280
I feel like Cinderella.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.780
Careful, if you're
not home by midnight, it might turn into a pantsuit.

01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.540
Wow!

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:00.790
Look at you.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:06.300
You don't...
You don't think it's a little small?

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.300
I'm sorry.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.640
It was hard to tell
what was going on underneath the pantsuit.

01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:17.230
Perfect. You ready?

01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:19.230
Okay.
You all right?

01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:23.730
Excuse me.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.240
All right.

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.540
Ready? All right.
Ready.

01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:35.460
 I feel lucky
I feel free

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:40.470
 I feel everything's
a possibility 

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:47.470
I can't believe
Senator Phillips and his wife

01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:49.980
were talking to us for,
like, 15 minutes. I know!

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.980
He didn't even know my name
before tonight.

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:54.980
Now he wants to hear my ideas
about the tobacco reform bill.

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:58.990
And she wants to
take me out to lunch. Some place with popovers!

01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:02.490
We make a great team.

01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:04.570
With you by my side,
we could own this town.

01:03:04.570 --> 01:03:06.580
We could totally own it.

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:08.360
I mean it, Ally.

01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:16.370
Look, I have my eyes
on a Senate seat, and then the presidency.

01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:18.370
Now, if tonight
is any indication,

01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:20.210
I think together
we could go all the way.

01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:21.540
Let's do it!

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:22.790
So, we're doing it?

01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:24.090
Yeah!

01:03:25.090 --> 01:03:26.960
What are we doing?

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:28.800
We're getting married!

01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:32.270
Oh.
Yeah!

01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:34.270
Well,

01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:37.520
maybe we should kiss first
and see how that goes.

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:40.890
A kiss? No.

01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:43.900
I want you to be my beard.
I'm gay.

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:47.700
What?

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.700
Gay. Like super gay.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:53.210
Like, one down here, one here,
one here, one here, gay.

01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:56.910
I thought you knew that.

01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:59.410
America's ready for
a black President.

01:03:59.410 --> 01:04:02.210
They're not ready for
a gay black President.

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:05.220
And we have history, Ally.

01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:08.550
I mean, I wouldn't
have known I was gay if I hadn't dated you.

01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:12.980
So, what do you say?

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:14.980
Can I get back to you?

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:36.250
Hey, Bandit.

01:04:40.790 --> 01:04:42.590
Wait, wait, wait. Don't move.
Stay right there.

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:45.840
What are you doing here?

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.340
I'm not depressed enough
to sleep with you.

01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:48.840
Close your eyes.

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:50.260
That won't help.

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:51.600
And

01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:53.550
open them.

01:04:58.690 --> 01:05:00.190
What do you think?

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:09.730
My wiring's a little spotty.

01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:12.400
Every time these go on,
your bathroom light burns out,

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.290
but I think it's worth it.

01:05:17.570 --> 01:05:19.070
What did you do?

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.080
I think it really
brings out the detail, you know?

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.580
I never noticed
Louie's gold tooth before.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.800
I named him Louie,
by the way.

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:29.340
I can't believe it.

01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:31.750
This is amazing.

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:35.260
Yeah. Well,
you sounded depressed on the phone, so...

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.260
You hungry?

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:39.930
I'm starving!

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:45.100
So, I got good news.
I found Julie from college.

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:48.100
She is a man now,
and she's single.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.240
She's cute.
Looks like Ralph Macchio.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.860
You know what?

01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:55.360
Even if he were straight,
it wouldn't have worked anyway.

01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:59.330
You got to be a lady
to be the First Lady, and I ain't no lady.

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:02.200
You're a lady.
You're lots of lady.

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:06.620
You're once, twice,
20 times a lady.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.380
Okay. Okay.

01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:17.020
 You're once, twice

01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:19.520
 Three times a lady

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:23.020
 I love you

01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:29.110
 Yeah, you're once, twice

01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:31.400
 Three times a lady

01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:36.820
 I love you 

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.820
Thank you. Thank you.

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:43.080
Whoa.

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.470
Oh, shit.

01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:52.470
I either need to
lie down or throw up.

01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:53.970
You okay?

01:06:53.970 --> 01:06:56.470
Yeah. No.

01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:58.970
I have to go to
my sister's wedding alone.

01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:02.060
I'll go with you.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.560
You'd do that?

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.060
Yeah. Why not?

01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:11.070
Thanks.
I really appreciate that.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.910
I still think
I'm gonna throw up.

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:19.660
Let's get some air.

01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:31.710
What are we doing?

01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:35.210
Just because it's dark
doesn't mean you have to whisper.

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:40.720
Are we in the Garden?

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.050
Yep.

01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:44.970
This has got
to be illegal.

01:07:44.970 --> 01:07:47.470
Yeah, probably.
I worked here one summer.

01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:48.640
I passed out programs

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.140
and I managed
to swipe a passkey before I got fired.

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:52.440
You got fired?

01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:55.950
Yeah. There was an incident
with the mascot.

01:07:56.450 --> 01:07:57.780
What happened?

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:01.040
I may or may not have pissed
in his pot of gold.

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:02.740
Ever played H.O.R.S.E.
in the Garden?

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:03.620
No.

01:08:06.330 --> 01:08:08.130
But I have played H.O.R.S.E.

01:08:08.130 --> 01:08:09.660
Okay, okay.

01:08:11.550 --> 01:08:12.710
Okay.

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:17.640
Oh! No!

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:22.140
"H" for you, my friend.
What are you doing?

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:26.010
We're playing strip H.O.R.S.E.
Is there another kind?

01:08:26.010 --> 01:08:28.010
There's the kind
where you keep your clothes on.

01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:32.149
What's fun about that? All right. "H."

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.439
Backboard.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.160
Uh-huh.

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.439
Okay. Okay.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.420
Oh, my God!

01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:01.460
Nope.

01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:07.640
Yeah!

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.560
Panty time!

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:14.140
Come on!

01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:26.540
That was close.
That's an "H."

01:09:29.790 --> 01:09:32.800
This is not fair.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.960
I miss one shot,
and I'm almost totally naked.

01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:38.580
Well, that's the game.

01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:41.090
Well, the game is changing.

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:42.890
It's now one-on-one.

01:09:49.649 --> 01:09:51.479
This way. Let's go, baby.

01:09:53.729 --> 01:09:55.070
Come get it.

01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:56.900
Okay. Let's go.

01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:02.410
 Here we go, here we go
Satellite radio

01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:04.110
 Y'all getting hit
with boom boom

01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:06.030
 Beats so big
I'm stepping on leprechauns

01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:09.780
 Shittin' on y'all
with the boom boom

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:11.670
 Shittin' on
y'all with the... 

01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:29.770
ALLY:  Oh, my God.

01:10:29.770 --> 01:10:31.270
I can't believe it.

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:33.770
I think that dress
is gonna look good on him.

01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:35.270
It's a good thing
you play the guitar,

01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:36.780
because you suck
at basketball.

01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:40.780
Well, you can't be
good at everything. It just wouldn't be fair.

01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:43.650
And I can't believe
that you can play Lionel Richie!

01:10:44.150 --> 01:10:45.650
I can play a lot of things.

01:10:45.650 --> 01:10:48.900
So, how come you
don't make a living at it? You're really good.

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:51.790
Ah, I want
to play my own music.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.160
Don't you worry
about paying the rent?

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.160
I don't love marketing, but...

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.660
What do you love?

01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:04.340
I love making those
freaky little sculptures,

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:06.340
but I'm not gonna
make any money at that.

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:09.340
How do you know?
You've never tried.

01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:13.350
I've never jumped
into the harbor, either.

01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:15.850
Doesn't mean that
it's a good idea.

01:11:15.850 --> 01:11:16.850
I think it's a great idea.

01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:20.850
I think it's the best idea
you've ever had.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.360
No.
Yes.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.530
No.
Yes!

01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:28.940
We are gonna jump in the harbor!

01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:30.450
No. No. No. No.
Let's go.

01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:32.870
God! No!

01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:33.870
Let's do it!

01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:56.940
Holy fuck,
this is fucking cold!

01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:58.940
This is the worst idea
you've ever had!

01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:15.070
I can't believe you
finally got me naked.

01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:16.910
Well, my shirt
does look good on you.

01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:18.660
Good, 'cause I'm keeping it.

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:21.460
No, you're not.
I can't afford to lose any more shirts.

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:23.470
Women are always
stealing my shirts.

01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:25.470
Women aren't always
stealing your shirts.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.720
They're borrowing them,
fully intending to give them back,

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:30.220
but you never call.

01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:32.390
So, you're saying
that if I have fewer one-night stands,

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:34.430
I'll have more shirts?

01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:35.930
I think so.

01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:41.400
Well, then, that settles it.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:44.690
I'm changing my ways,

01:12:45.190 --> 01:12:47.520
and I'm not gonna
lose any more shirts.

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:50.740
Really?

01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:52.110
Really.

01:12:54.450 --> 01:12:58.450
In fact, I think I'm gonna
take this one back right now.

01:12:58.450 --> 01:12:59.950
Good for you.

01:13:24.810 --> 01:13:25.810
Wait.

01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:26.810
It's okay, I have one.

01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:28.310
No.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.120
I have to slow down.

01:13:33.490 --> 01:13:36.490
Okay. Okay, that's fine.

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:44.080
What if I just put
it in a little bit? It won't even count.

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.080
Eileen says it counts.

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:52.090
What about, like, that much?
That's nothing.

01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:54.090
You won't even feel it.

01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:59.010
Okay. I understand.
That's fine.

01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:03.350
But I am gonna
keep kissing you.

01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:38.460
Hi.

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:41.250
You look so beautiful
in the morning.

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.170
I do?
Yeah.

01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:53.760
How's this for
a slice of awesome?

01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:57.480
Mexican wrestling
on pay-per-view all day.

01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:58.980
I will run to the store

01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:01.230
and get eggs and salsa
for huevos rancheros,

01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:05.070
you stay here and
whip up margaritas. Sound good?

01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:09.660
Shit! I can't! Oh, my God!

01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:11.660
Cereal?

01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:13.910
No! I'm meeting Daisy.

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:17.830
I'm already late.
She hates it when I'm late. Oh, no.

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.060
Whoo!

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:45.230
I can't believe
Eddie didn't want to pick out these place cards.

01:15:45.230 --> 01:15:47.730
Oh, no, no, no. He has
terrible taste in fonts.

01:15:47.730 --> 01:15:49.700
Have you convinced Mom
to come to the wedding yet?

01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:50.700
No, and I don't have to,

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:53.150
because you are gonna
talk Dad out of coming.

01:15:53.150 --> 01:15:54.990
I am?
Let's face it.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.410
Dad's only coming because
he thinks that he has to.

01:15:57.410 --> 01:16:00.570
So, why not just
let him off the hook and make everybody happy?

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:02.580
It's not a bad idea.

01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:05.580
Oh, great! You guys can
cast the final vote. We've narrowed it down.

01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:09.330
To this one,
or this nearly identical one.

01:16:09.330 --> 01:16:10.920
Monotype Corsiva.

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:12.550
How do you know that?
I'm married.

01:16:12.970 --> 01:16:15.810
EILEEN: Okay, are we done?
Because we want to hear about D.C.

01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:17.730
Did you go to
the Holocaust Museum?

01:16:17.730 --> 01:16:19.730
No, but that would
have been more fun.

01:16:19.730 --> 01:16:21.560
So, there were
no sparks with Tom?

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:25.020
Tom? What happened to Jake?
I thought you were looking for Jake.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.490
Jake's in Africa
and Tom's gay, but it's okay,

01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:30.990
because Colin is gonna be
my date for the wedding.

01:16:31.490 --> 01:16:33.520
Is that the guy
who answered your cell phone

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:36.280
and got mad at me
for waking him up at 2:00 in the afternoon?

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:38.110
Yeah. I took
his phone by mistake.

01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:40.750
You invited Colin?
Your rapey neighbor?

01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:42.000
Do we call him that?

01:16:42.330 --> 01:16:44.870
Just behind your back.

01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:48.870
Okay. Well, let's stop
because he's actually a pretty good guy.

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:50.340
DAISY: Oh, Ally.

01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:51.340
What?

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:52.840
You slept with him!

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:54.350
Oh, no!

01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:57.130
I did not. I didn't.

01:16:57.130 --> 01:16:58.470
EILEEN: Good. Don't.

01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:59.970
Because he's not
the kind of guy you end up with.

01:16:59.970 --> 01:17:02.520
He's the kind of guy you date
before the guy you end up with.

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.520
How do you know?
You haven't even met him.

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.720
I don't have to meet him.
I've had sex with him.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.230
Except his name is Doug,
and he's a fucking liar!

01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:12.860
Well, I have met him,
and he is dangerously sexy.

01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:16.780
And if he wanted to come in
through the back door, you'd let him.

01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:18.070
Don't let him, Ally.

01:17:18.450 --> 01:17:20.460
You guys don't need to worry.

01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:22.460
I'm not going to
let him in any door.

01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:24.960
He's just a friend
who's doing me a favor.

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.410
COLIN: Honey, I'm home.

01:17:56.110 --> 01:18:00.110
So, I TiVo-ed
Mexican wrestling for you and I cooked.

01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:03.110
They're supposed
to be taquitos, they look like cannolis,

01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:06.620
but they kind of taste
like egg rolls.

01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:09.000
What are you doing?
Are you working on the diner? All right.

01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:12.510
Don't let me bug you.

01:18:18.850 --> 01:18:21.850
Hey, so,
just out of curiosity,

01:18:21.850 --> 01:18:24.350
did you ever hear
anything from Jake?

01:18:24.850 --> 01:18:26.140
Nope.

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:31.530
Really?
Not a phone call? Nothing?

01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:33.480
Nope.

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.480
Okay, well,

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:42.240
I'm kind of busy right now,
so I guess I'll just see you later.

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:45.040
Shit! Ally, wait.

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:46.540
Wait, wait.
Just go.

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:48.040
I don't want to
hear any more lies.

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.540
All right, yes.
Jake is back in town

01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:52.080
and I do have his number,
but I didn't think that mattered now.

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:53.830
Would you please just go?

01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:55.330
What about last night?

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:57.340
I think we should just forget
about last night.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.640
Because of Jake?
No.

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:05.510
Because you're
not the kind of guy I'm supposed to end up with.

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:08.230
What kind of guy am I, Ally?

01:19:11.230 --> 01:19:12.730
You're the kind
of guy you date

01:19:12.730 --> 01:19:14.240
before you meet
the guy you end up with,

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:15.600
and I've already
dated 20 of you.

01:19:21.610 --> 01:19:23.280
So, you're gonna try
and make it work with Jake,

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.780
a guy you haven't
seen in years,

01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:26.700
just so you don't go
over the number 20?

01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:28.200
It's not just
about a number anymore, okay?

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:29.500
Well, then what is it?

01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:30.530
It's what I want!

01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:32.170
You don't know
what you want, Ally.

01:19:32.670 --> 01:19:34.840
You're so busy trying to be
what everyone else wants you to be,

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:35.670
you don't know who you are.

01:19:36.090 --> 01:19:38.590
At least I have
relationships.

01:19:38.590 --> 01:19:41.100
You can't even
hang out with a woman for 24 hours

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:41.930
without sleeping with her.

01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:44.210
That was true until I met you.

01:19:47.690 --> 01:19:52.220
Well, I'm sure that
if we had slept together, you'd be long gone by now,

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:53.720
because that's
who you are, Colin,

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.730
and that's who
you'll always be.

01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:00.200
All right.
Whatever you say, Ally.

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.200
You obviously have
it all figured out.

01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:07.620
And I do know who I am!

01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:09.120
I'm someone who's
not gonna let

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:11.630
another undeserving
asshole into my heart!

01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:13.630
Or my vagina!

01:20:13.630 --> 01:20:15.500
MALE TENANT: Shut the fuck up!

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:16.500
Stop fucking your dog!

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:46.630
Hi, Jake Adams, it's Ally.

01:20:47.130 --> 01:20:50.640
Ally Darling from high school.
Go, Vikings.

01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:53.050
Um...

01:20:53.050 --> 01:20:54.560
I came across your number,

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:59.060
and I thought, "Wow,
I should really call Jake

01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:04.070
"and leave him a long,
rambling message on his voice mail."

01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:09.320
Anyway,
if you're feeling up to it,

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:11.820
you can give me
a call anytime.

01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:14.330
My number is 617-55...

01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:19.330
Oh, my God, I just hiccupped.
I'm sorry.

01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:21.500
617-55...

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
All right. Okay...

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.920
My number is 617-555-0192.
Okay, bye.

01:21:33.010 --> 01:21:36.010
Well, who doesn't
call that girl back?

01:21:43.050 --> 01:21:44.270
Not again.

01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:46.270
Who's the surprise
guest this time?

01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:47.480
I was supposed to
have lunch with Dad

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:48.980
to tell him that he
didn't have to come to the wedding,

01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:50.560
but then he said he was
gonna bring his girlfriend.

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.560
Jacinda?
Yeah.

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:53.950
And I just couldn't
have that conversation with him in front of her.

01:21:53.950 --> 01:21:56.450
So, I just thought, you know,
we could do it together.

01:21:56.450 --> 01:22:00.290
I am never meeting you
for another meal ever again.

01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:03.290
You don't mean that.

01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:05.540
Ally, I didn't
know you were coming. What a nice surprise.

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:07.300
Hi.
I'm Daisy.

01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:10.130
Got all my girls here.
I see that you've got one of these, too.

01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:12.720
I got a couple
for the two of us, so we can text and tweet.

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:15.970
You should
follow me on Twitter, "VeryTerry3."

01:22:15.970 --> 01:22:17.970
Or we could just
talk right now.

01:22:17.970 --> 01:22:20.810
LOL.

01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:24.260
He is so excited
about your wedding. It's all he can text about.

01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:27.270
I can't wait for everyone
to meet my lady.

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:30.490
Oh, you're coming
to the wedding, too?

01:22:30.490 --> 01:22:33.490
That's great. That's so great.

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:34.990
Ally, isn't that so great?

01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:36.990
It's great.
It's so great.

01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:38.740
Oh!

01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:42.360
Excuse me for a second.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.700
Don't go.

01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:45.700
We are just fine.

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:51.170
Hold up. Ashton is
getting his car washed.

01:22:51.170 --> 01:22:52.670
Nuh-uh.
Lookit.

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:00.050
 I am a human rocket

01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:02.380
 On a mission of deployment

01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:04.550
 I've been cocked and loaded

01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:06.690
 Ready for the culmination

01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:09.360
 I am a human missile

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.110
 Guided by a secret agenda

01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:13.610
 That commands
my every thoughts and deeds

01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:16.060
 And wills me on my way

01:23:20.490 --> 01:23:22.490
 I am a human rocket

01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:25.290
 On a mission of redemption

01:23:25.290 --> 01:23:27.160
 I've been cocked and loaded

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.630
 Primed by everything I know

01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:32.130
 I am a human missile

01:23:32.130 --> 01:23:34.000
 Guided by a secret voice

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.550
 That commands
my every thoughts and deeds

01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:38.970
 And wills me
on my righteous way 

01:24:38.610 --> 01:24:40.110
JAKE: All right. Great.

01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:42.900
Ally.

01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:44.700
Jake.

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:48.710
My brothers actually
went more into the business side of things,

01:24:48.710 --> 01:24:51.710
and when my dad asked me
to run the foundation,

01:24:51.710 --> 01:24:54.710
it was sort of
more of a natural fit for me, you know?

01:24:54.710 --> 01:24:57.210
I've always been better
at giving away money versus making it.

01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:59.300
I'm rambling.
I can hear myself totally rambling.

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:00.920
No. No, no, not at all.
I am. I am.

01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:03.420
I've been doing it all day.
Kind of, but it's interesting.

01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:05.390
Hey, what do...
I mean, what about you?

01:25:05.390 --> 01:25:07.480
Last I heard you were
in marketing, right?

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:11.480
Yeah. I'm actually
in between jobs right now.

01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:12.730
Well, listen, say the word.

01:25:13.230 --> 01:25:14.730
I mean,
I can get you an interview over at Adams in two seconds.

01:25:14.730 --> 01:25:16.480
Oh, thank you.

01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:17.320
But you know what?
I'm actually...

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:18.820
I'm thinking
about making a change.

01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:21.490
A change? Oh, yeah?
What would you do?

01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:25.490
I make these clay sculptures.

01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:29.330
They're sort of
these freaky little urban scenes.

01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:32.420
They're kind of
hard to explain. I'd really have to show you.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.200
I'd love to see them.

01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:37.120
Really?

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:39.010
They're in my shower.

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:42.340
Then I guess we're done here.

01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:50.770
See. This is where they dry.

01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:52.770
Wow. They really
are in your shower.

01:25:52.770 --> 01:25:54.270
Yep.

01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:14.070
ALLY:  Did I tell you
that he speaks four different languages,

01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:15.990
but he's so not
obnoxious about it?

01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:20.000
And he's still so
goddamn handsome, and he smells so fucking good.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
It's crazy.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.500
He's taking me to a gala
at the Institute of Contemporary Art,

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:26.500
and then I think
we're going to go...

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:29.010
Whoa.
That's not your dress.

01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:32.010
Yeah. Yeah, I know, I just...

01:26:32.010 --> 01:26:34.560
Yeah,
I just like this one better, 'cause there's just...

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:37.570
You know,
it's more comfortable. There's just more room to...

01:26:37.570 --> 01:26:41.900
To eat and to move, and to...
To dance.

01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:43.190
Okay.

01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:45.190
I couldn't breathe
in my other dress!

01:26:45.190 --> 01:26:48.610
A bride should
be able to breathe in her own fucking dress!

01:26:48.610 --> 01:26:52.610
Sorry, I just am feeling
really stressed out right now

01:26:52.610 --> 01:26:56.750
because I don't know how
I'm going to convince Mom

01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:58.670
to come to my wedding,

01:26:58.670 --> 01:27:01.670
because our dad
is bringing our new mommy,

01:27:01.670 --> 01:27:03.170
and she's not...
Stop.

01:27:03.170 --> 01:27:04.680
I will go with you
to talk to Mom,

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:07.680
and you don't even
have to trick me. Okay?

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:11.180
Now, are you sure
you can breathe in this dress?

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:14.690
Okay, then do that.

01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:18.610
ALLY: It's really not
gonna be that bad.

01:27:18.610 --> 01:27:21.110
We're gonna loosen her up.
We're gonna ease into it.

01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:22.610
It's gonna be great.

01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:24.400
If you say so.

01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:26.700
Mom?

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:30.400
I don't believe you!

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.900
When were you planning
to tell me about all this?

01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:34.130
Hmm?

01:27:34.130 --> 01:27:36.130
Uh... Now?

01:27:36.130 --> 01:27:37.630
That's why we're here, Mom.

01:27:37.630 --> 01:27:40.750
I have to read
about it in a magazine?

01:27:40.750 --> 01:27:42.580
You and Jake Adams.

01:27:44.050 --> 01:27:45.500
Are you an item?

01:27:47.010 --> 01:27:47.920
Yes?

01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:51.430
Did you just squeal, Mom?

01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:54.730
I don't know.
I'm out of my body right now.

01:27:55.230 --> 01:27:57.350
Is it serious?

01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:59.650
It could be,
but we're taking it slow.

01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:01.570
Do you really
have that luxury?

01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:03.520
I want to make sure
that it's right.

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:06.160
Oh, it doesn't get
any more right than Jake Adams.

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:09.160
This is your life, Ally,
don't get creative.

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:11.660
When I saw you two
in that magazine,

01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:14.170
I went and found
some old photographs.

01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:17.080
Just look at this.

01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:21.340
I knew
he was the one.

01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:23.590
Aw.

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:27.550
Tell me, Ally,
is he gonna be your date to the wedding?

01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:31.020
Is he, Ally?

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:36.890
Yes.

01:28:37.390 --> 01:28:38.970
Oh!

01:28:38.970 --> 01:28:41.480
Oh, I got to get
the seating chart.

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:43.610
So, you're still
gonna come to the wedding,

01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:45.610
even though Dad's
gonna be there, too?

01:28:45.610 --> 01:28:46.860
Of course, darling.

01:28:47.230 --> 01:28:49.480
My baby only
gets married once.

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:50.650
Right?

01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:54.120
I am so proud of my girls.

01:28:57.210 --> 01:28:59.210
Seating chart. Seating chart.

01:28:59.210 --> 01:29:00.710
Where's the little
seating chart?

01:29:01.210 --> 01:29:03.210
Do we tell her
about Jacinda?

01:29:03.210 --> 01:29:06.220
No. I think we quit
while we're ahead.

01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:08.220
Bye, Mom.
Bye, Mom.

01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:09.590
What?

01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:11.090
 ...and get you drunk

01:29:11.090 --> 01:29:15.090
 So I can have
my wicked way with you

01:29:15.090 --> 01:29:17.100
 I'm just being honest

01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:22.270
 'Cause I know
the other guys are thinking just the same way too

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:27.940
I really love
Japan.

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.240
Really?

01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:34.500
Are those
mini cheeseburgers? Yes, they are.

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:36.500
May I? Thank you.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.500
You didn't want one?

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:42.500
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:46.420
Mmm. These are excellent
mini cheeseburgers.

01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:48.760
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:54.600
 Show me some skin
I might bite it

01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:58.600
 I wanna have
my wicked way with you

01:30:02.610 --> 01:30:08.110
 So I'm not gonna come over
and meet your mom and dad

01:30:08.110 --> 01:30:10.610
 They know that I was bad

01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:13.620
 I'm just thinking
of three hours or more

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:18.120
 So I can have
my wicked way with you

01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:24.500
 My wicked way with you 

01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:33.970
Colin, hi.

01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:35.510
Hi.

01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:39.510
Fancy meeting you here,
dressed all fancy.

01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:40.810
Where you off to?

01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:43.600
A wedding.

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:46.270
You, too, right?
Today's Daisy's big day.

01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:49.270
Yeah.

01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:53.270
Wow. You're going
to a wedding, too. That's weird.

01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:54.740
Whose wedding?

01:30:56.740 --> 01:30:58.610
Nobody you know.

01:30:58.610 --> 01:31:01.120
Oh.

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:04.840
Is it like
a date or something? Are you seeing somebody?

01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:09.340
Don't worry about it, Ally.

01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:18.550
Don't drink
too much champagne.

01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:46.210
Hey, is my hair
too high?

01:31:46.630 --> 01:31:47.630
Oh, no, honey.
It's perfect.

01:31:48.130 --> 01:31:49.130
JAMIE: Is it going on?

01:31:49.130 --> 01:31:50.130
The dress doesn't fit.

01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:51.630
Okay.
Why isn't it zipped?

01:31:51.630 --> 01:31:53.470
Can I get some help here?

01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:56.000
Where's my
Croissan'Wich?

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.010
Did somebody eat
my Croissan'Wich?

01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:59.510
No, honey. Nobody did.
You just relax, okay?

01:31:59.510 --> 01:32:01.260
Katie, Jamie,
find Daisy's Croissan'Wich.

01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:03.060
Okay. On it.
Got it. Okay.

01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:05.060
Okay, listen,

01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:06.510
I don't want
anyone to panic but...

01:32:06.510 --> 01:32:07.260
What's happening?

01:32:07.650 --> 01:32:08.650
The harpist isn't coming.

01:32:08.650 --> 01:32:10.270
I had a harpist?

01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:12.100
She broke her finger
during the philharmonic softball league playoffs,

01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:14.610
and given that this is
one of the busiest wedding weekends of the year,

01:32:14.610 --> 01:32:16.190
all the other
harpists are booked.

01:32:16.190 --> 01:32:18.190
Oh, Christ.
Why is this happening to me?

01:32:18.190 --> 01:32:20.190
KEVIN: I got a list
of all the other weddings happening in the city

01:32:20.190 --> 01:32:21.700
and found a replacement
who can be here

01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:23.410
as soon as her
first wedding is over.

01:32:23.410 --> 01:32:27.080
And if she doesn't show,
I play the horn.

01:32:27.090 --> 01:32:28.920
Now let's get this
girl married, huh?

01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:31.920
Daise, I got it.

01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:58.820
OFFICIANT:
Please rise for the bride.

01:33:06.990 --> 01:33:08.990
We are gathered here today
to celebrate the union

01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:12.660
of Daisy Ann Darling
and Edward Michael Vogel.

01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:15.970
Getting to know
Daisy and Eddie has reinforced my belief that,

01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:18.000
while love is universal,

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.500
every couple is unique.

01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:31.180
Daisy Darling,
today I make these vows to you.

01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:33.680
I will never rhyme
"crazy" with "Daisy,"

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:38.020
even if I mean,
like, "crazy good."

01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:40.410
I will not blow my nose
in the shower.

01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:46.160
I promise to
always consult you before getting a haircut

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.500
and to never grow
a moustache.

01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:50.250
Or a soul patch.
No.

01:33:54.170 --> 01:33:57.460
I will not blame you
for the bad decisions you make in my dreams.

01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:07.470
I will keep an eye
on that suspicious freckle on your back,

01:34:07.470 --> 01:34:11.220
even though I'm
really sure it's nothing.

01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:16.860
And I will not get mad at you
about everything

01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:20.200
when I'm only
really mad at you about one thing.

01:34:24.490 --> 01:34:25.490
OFFICIANT:
By the power vested in me,

01:34:25.490 --> 01:34:27.910
I am happy to pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:29.410
You may kiss the bride.

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:37.580
 I'm holding a heart
here in my hand

01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:43.500
 Hey, hey, hey

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:48.310
 My own work of art

01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:50.730
 Here where I stand

01:34:50.730 --> 01:34:56.230
 Hey, hey, hey 

01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:07.830
 I can see clearly now
The rain is gone

01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:14.290
 I can see all obstacles
in my way 

01:35:14.290 --> 01:35:16.590
Quite a party.
Yeah, it sure is.

01:35:16.590 --> 01:35:18.920
Hold on.
I have to tweet about this.

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:20.930
And hi there.

01:35:25.050 --> 01:35:27.550
Your mom always did
have a great laugh.

01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:30.050
I'm just glad she's happy.

01:35:30.050 --> 01:35:32.050
Are you happy?

01:35:32.050 --> 01:35:33.800
Yeah. Of course.

01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:41.730
Your mom only wants
what's best for you, you know.

01:35:41.730 --> 01:35:43.060
I know.

01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:44.450
Unfortunately, she thinks
what's best for you

01:35:44.450 --> 01:35:46.150
is being exactly like her,

01:35:46.150 --> 01:35:47.480
only you're not, Ally.

01:35:47.490 --> 01:35:50.570
You may have her looks,
but you have my rhythm, kid.

01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:52.570
I'm afraid it's
a little offbeat.

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:57.210
I guess that explains
why she's always disappointed in me.

01:35:57.210 --> 01:36:00.210
I think it's hard
for her to look at you and see so much of me.

01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:09.390
 Thanks for the time

01:36:09.390 --> 01:36:11.180
 That you've given me

01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:13.560
Uh, may I?

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.560
Why not?

01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:18.070
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:22.900
God, I'm sorry.
I just couldn't slow-dance with your mother.

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:25.410
No, that's okay.

01:36:27.410 --> 01:36:30.910
I think the last time
we slow-danced was prom night.

01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:33.920
Yeah. Yeah, it was.
I remember that.

01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.420
I believe that
was also the night

01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:37.420
where you finally
gave me the honor

01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:40.920
of making you unfit
for every other man in the village.

01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:44.340
Oh, boy.

01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:47.630
 You're once, twice

01:36:49.630 --> 01:36:53.020
 Three times a lady

01:36:53.020 --> 01:36:56.520
I know this isn't
the ideal place to tell you, but I want to be honest.

01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:58.270
You weren't my first.

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:00.560
I wasn't?

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:02.530
No, I'm sorry.

01:37:02.530 --> 01:37:07.310
Well, so you've been
with two guys in your life. Big deal.

01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:11.650
More like two times 10.

01:37:11.650 --> 01:37:17.160
Right.
Like you've had sex with 20 guys. Yuck.

01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:20.160
Gross.

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.670
Well, all right.
I may not have been your first,

01:37:25.670 --> 01:37:29.170
but maybe I'll be your last.

01:37:29.170 --> 01:37:31.670
Why? Are you gonna
rape and kill me?

01:37:31.670 --> 01:37:33.670
No, but I'm gonna kiss you.

01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:38.150
 With every beat

01:37:38.650 --> 01:37:43.480
 Of my heart

01:37:44.490 --> 01:37:45.490
 You're once

01:37:45.490 --> 01:37:46.990
Come with me for a second.

01:37:46.990 --> 01:37:48.440
 Twice

01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:53.580
 Three times a lady

01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:59.080
So, how does dinner in Milan
and breakfast in Paris sound?

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:00.580
Starchy.

01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:02.590
I've got to do
a little traveling for the foundation,

01:38:02.590 --> 01:38:04.090
and I'd love it
if you came with me.

01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:07.090
Seriously?
Mmm-hmm.

01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:08.590
For how long?

01:38:09.090 --> 01:38:10.340
Six months.

01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:12.850
I know it sounds
like a long time, but you're in-between jobs

01:38:12.850 --> 01:38:16.930
and your little
sculpture things can wait.

01:38:16.930 --> 01:38:18.390
And if you think
about it,

01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:19.890
the only thing
that's keeping you in Boston is me,

01:38:19.890 --> 01:38:21.190
and I'm leaving.

01:38:23.310 --> 01:38:24.810
It's time.

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:28.610
Excuse me.

01:38:31.530 --> 01:38:32.780
Thank you.

01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:39.460
 And I love you 

01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:45.580
Join me.

01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:47.000
Hi, everyone.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.550
ALL: Hi.

01:38:50.050 --> 01:38:52.970
When Daisy and Eddie
first got together,

01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:56.510
I have to admit I was
a little bit nervous.

01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:58.510
I could tell
that it was serious,

01:38:58.510 --> 01:39:01.510
and I thought that
the closer she got to him,

01:39:02.010 --> 01:39:04.520
the further away
she'd get from me,

01:39:04.850 --> 01:39:07.320
but that didn't happen.

01:39:09.190 --> 01:39:11.690
Not only do I
see more of Daisy,

01:39:11.690 --> 01:39:14.940
I see a happier,
even better Daisy.

01:39:19.610 --> 01:39:21.620
It's like with Eddie she's

01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:26.620
completely herself.

01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:46.520
When you're a big sister,
it's your job

01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:48.780
to teach your
little sister everything.

01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:52.730
How to ride a bike,

01:39:52.730 --> 01:39:54.530
how to lie to your parents.

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:56.530
How to kiss.

01:39:56.530 --> 01:39:58.240
Not with tongue.
Settle down, Uncle Charlie.

01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:04.320
But I never thought

01:40:06.330 --> 01:40:09.830
about what my little sister
could teach me until right now.

01:40:10.750 --> 01:40:13.800
So, I want to
thank you, Daisy.

01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:16.800
Thank you for teaching me

01:40:18.810 --> 01:40:22.810
that being in love
means being yourself.

01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:29.070
To Daisy and Eddie!

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:36.660
You were great.
Can we talk?

01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:38.660
Yeah. Absolutely.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.500
ALL:
 That's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh

01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:45.780
 I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh

01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:47.790
 That's the way,
uh-huh, uh-huh

01:40:47.790 --> 01:40:50.120
 I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh

01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:51.620
 That's the way,
uh-huh, uh-huh 

01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:53.120
Oh, shit.

01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:57.290
What's going on?
Are you okay?

01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:04.300
Jake, there
actually is something here in Boston

01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:06.300
that's really
important to me.

01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:10.310
And as much as I want
to travel the world,

01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:12.810
I'm not sure I want
to do it with you.

01:41:12.810 --> 01:41:16.310
Which is insane, I know,
because you're perfect.

01:41:17.310 --> 01:41:19.320
But you're not perfect for me,

01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:22.820
and I don't think
I'm perfect for you.

01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:26.290
I'm so sorry, Jake.

01:41:26.290 --> 01:41:29.290
If I had been honest
with myself earlier,

01:41:29.290 --> 01:41:31.300
or ever,

01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:33.300
I wouldn't have put
you through all this.

01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:37.800
Yeah, well,
that would have been preferable.

01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:40.800
Right. I don't think
I'm gonna stick around for the cake. Excuse me.

01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:43.810
It's really good.

01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:00.190
Okay.

01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:07.910
Where's...
Where's Jake going?

01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:08.870
Sir, champagne?

01:42:09.370 --> 01:42:10.250
ALLY: He's leaving.

01:42:10.250 --> 01:42:13.750
What? In the middle
of the reception? Why?

01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:16.260
Because I never should have
brought him here in the first place.

01:42:17.170 --> 01:42:19.960
You're gonna let him go?

01:42:20.290 --> 01:42:23.050
Oh, Ally, I...
I don't understand you.

01:42:23.050 --> 01:42:26.050
Ally, why?
Why are you doing this?

01:42:26.050 --> 01:42:28.720
Honey, you were
finally happy.

01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:32.190
No! You were finally happy.

01:42:32.190 --> 01:42:34.360
I don't wanna
marry Jake Adams.

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:36.230
That's not who I am.
Oh, my...

01:42:36.230 --> 01:42:39.230
I'm a jobless whore
who's slept with 20 guys,

01:42:39.730 --> 01:42:44.150
and I want to be with somebody
who appreciates that about me.

01:42:44.150 --> 01:42:47.620
You may not
understand me, Mom, but you don't have to.

01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:49.370
All you have to do
is love me.

01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:55.880
I know that I'm not perfect,
but that's why you have Daisy.

01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:58.380
My dress is too tight
because I'm four months pregnant.

01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:04.050
What?

01:43:04.050 --> 01:43:05.060
Oh!

01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:08.590
You're pregnant?

01:43:08.590 --> 01:43:11.060
Yes. Now get out of here.

01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:13.060
Thank you.

01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:14.060
Surprise!

01:43:14.570 --> 01:43:18.240
I'm gonna be a grandmother.
I'm gonna be a grandmother.

01:43:23.070 --> 01:43:24.520
All the drinks are
sitting here on your tray.

01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:26.530
What is the matter with you?
Is this too difficult?

01:43:26.530 --> 01:43:28.030
Kevin,
where's that list you had of all the other weddings

01:43:28.030 --> 01:43:29.530
going on in the city today?
It's right here.

01:43:29.530 --> 01:43:30.580
Okay, thank you.

01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:44.350
Goddamn. Damn it!

01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:03.620
Hi.

01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:04.740
 Every time I think of you

01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:08.990
 I feel shot right through
with a bolt of blue

01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:13.460
 It's no problem of mine
But it's a problem I find

01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:15.300
 Living a life
that I can't leave behind

01:44:17.970 --> 01:44:21.250
 But there's no sense
in telling me

01:44:21.250 --> 01:44:23.250
 The wisdom of the fool
won't set you free

01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:27.140
 But that's the way
that it goes

01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:29.480
 And it's what nobody knows

01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:33.810
 Well, every day
my confusion grows

01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:37.400
 Every time I see you falling

01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:41.410
 I get down on my knees
and pray

01:44:41.410 --> 01:44:45.780
 I'm waiting for
that final moment

01:44:46.190 --> 01:44:47.200
Colin!

01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:02.260
 I feel fine and I feel good

01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:05.260
 I feel like I never should

01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:09.130
 Whenever I get this way
I just don't know what to say

01:45:09.130 --> 01:45:14.140
 Why can't we be ourselves
like we were yesterday?

01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:17.940
 Every time I see you falling

01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:21.950
 I get down on my knees
and pray

01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:26.120
 I'm waiting for
that final moment

01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:29.620
 You say the words
that I can't say 

01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:37.380
Oh, come on!

01:45:38.830 --> 01:45:42.830
Blessed be this union
and may it bear fruit.

01:46:09.110 --> 01:46:11.830
Colin! Colin!

01:46:21.210 --> 01:46:23.090
Blue car, keys are in it.

01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:48.650
MAN: Get the fuck
out of the road!

01:46:48.650 --> 01:46:50.070
Hey, watch it, lady.

01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:52.450
Shut up, you asshole!

01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:57.160
Sorry! I'm sorry!

01:46:57.660 --> 01:46:59.160
I'm sorry!

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:14.510
Thank you.

01:47:15.010 --> 01:47:17.810
You can help yourself
to some pepperoni.

01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:25.100
Miss, your name?

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:28.410
Uh...

01:47:29.410 --> 01:47:30.410
I...

01:47:35.610 --> 01:47:38.950
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:41.000
COLIN:  Hi, everyone.
Hope you're all having a good time tonight.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.670
I know we are.

01:47:42.670 --> 01:47:45.960
This next song
is a local band. Hope you enjoy it.

01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:54.770
 I don't mind you
coming here

01:47:56.350 --> 01:47:58.350
 And wasting all my time

01:47:59.890 --> 01:48:02.680
 'Cause when you're
standing oh, so near

01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:06.260
 I kind of lose my mind

01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:07.270
This is bullshit.

01:48:07.770 --> 01:48:10.270
Why didn't I just wait for him
at his apartment?

01:48:11.190 --> 01:48:14.070
 And wasting all my time

01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:17.740
Fuck!

01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:19.240
Fuck!

01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:20.750
Fuck!
Fuck!

01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:25.950
 I don't mind you hanging out

01:48:25.950 --> 01:48:27.870
 And talking in your sleep

01:48:29.670 --> 01:48:33.120
 It doesn't matter
where you've been

01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:36.010
 As long as it was deep
Yeah

01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:40.520
 Always need to wear it well

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:42.770
 You look so fancy,
I can tell

01:48:44.770 --> 01:48:46.600
 I don't mind you hanging out

01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:50.020
 And talking in your sleep

01:48:52.030 --> 01:48:55.780
 I guess you're
just what I needed

01:48:55.780 --> 01:48:58.070
 I needed someone to feed

01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:59.400
 Someone to...

01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:01.820
 I need to talk to you

01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:04.210
 Right now

01:49:04.210 --> 01:49:05.820
 I needed someone
to feed 

01:49:09.210 --> 01:49:11.460
Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut.

01:49:13.470 --> 01:49:15.830
Okay, everybody,
we're just gonna take a quick break.

01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:18.140
Why don't we get
those toasts started?

01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:21.260
So, papa bear,
come on up here.

01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:29.980
MAN:  Hello, everyone,
and thank you all for coming out tonight...

01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:34.490
Fuckity fuck! Fuckity fuck! Fuckity fuck!

01:49:36.990 --> 01:49:38.990
What are you
doing here, Ally?

01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:40.490
I have a speech that
I wanna make to you,

01:49:40.990 --> 01:49:42.990
but I was afraid that
I was gonna forget it.

01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:47.500
So, I figured it would be
easier to drive, bike,

01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:52.000
and run across town
in my high heels so I could tell you right now.

01:49:55.010 --> 01:49:56.510
What's the speech?

01:50:00.010 --> 01:50:03.600
Well, the gist of it was,

01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:05.880
I'm sorry.

01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:08.300
That's it?

01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:10.020
No, wait, there's more.

01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:11.360
I, um...

01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:15.860
I'm happiest when
I'm being myself,

01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:18.360
and I'm myself
when I'm with you.

01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:20.700
That was it.

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:24.070
I guess I was just so afraid
that you were another asshole

01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:27.870
that I became
the biggest asshole of all.

01:50:27.870 --> 01:50:30.370
You weren't an asshole.
I was an asshole.

01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:33.380
I should have given
you Jake's number, I just...

01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:36.380
I didn't think
I could compete with that.

01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:41.390
There's no contest.

01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:44.390
You're the most
decent guy I've ever met.

01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:58.900
I think I love you, 21.

01:51:01.690 --> 01:51:03.190
I love you, too.

01:51:05.190 --> 01:51:07.030
Three hundred and...
No!

01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:53.740
JAY:  Hey, Kelli,
Kelli with an "I." What's up?

01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:56.240
It's Jay from
Club Med Turkoise.

01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:58.250
I got a weird message
from your assistant,

01:51:58.750 --> 01:52:01.750
and I just wanted
to let you know, we never had sex.

01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:05.750
Uh, you did this
awkward striptease involving maracas,

01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:08.510
and then gave me
a shitty hand job.

01:52:08.890 --> 01:52:12.390
You claimed it was something
you like to do called "dry style,"

01:52:12.390 --> 01:52:15.900
vomited in my suitcase,
and then you passed out in the shower.

01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:17.900
So, yeah,
we never slept together.

01:52:22.770 --> 01:52:26.770
You're number 20!
I'm still at 20!

01:52:26.770 --> 01:52:31.330
I can't believe it!
You are number 20!

01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:33.330
Yes!

01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:39.840
 It will outlast everything
You think is set is stone

01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:41.840
 It goes on and on
and on and on

01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:43.840
 On and on and on and on

01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:47.850
 Buzzing like neon lights

01:52:47.850 --> 01:52:49.850
 Can you feel my love?

01:52:49.850 --> 01:52:53.850
 Loud and clear
Pulls you near

01:52:53.850 --> 01:52:57.360
 Can you feel my love?

01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:01.860
 We got all the memories
So much more we can see

01:53:01.860 --> 01:53:05.360
 Better than a first kiss
Snow falling at Christmas

01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:09.870
 Like sleeping in on Sunday
Laughter we never faked

01:53:09.870 --> 01:53:13.870
 Bob Marley in summer
One love for each other

01:53:13.870 --> 01:53:14.870
 Oh, it feels like...

01:53:15.370 --> 01:53:18.380
 Fireflies
Day and night

01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:20.880
 Can you feel my love?

01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:26.890
 Everyone is looking
for a special connection

01:53:26.890 --> 01:53:31.390
 But it's like
your compass points a million directions

01:53:31.390 --> 01:53:35.390
 Do you need me to buy you
a telescope so you can see

01:53:35.390 --> 01:53:39.400
 How good this could be

01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:43.400
 Buzzing like neon lights

01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:45.400
 Can you feel my love?

01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:49.410
 Loud and clear
Pulls you near

01:53:49.410 --> 01:53:52.410
 Can you feel my love?

01:53:52.410 --> 01:53:56.910
 We got all the memories
So much more we can see

01:53:56.920 --> 01:54:00.420
 Better than a first kiss
Snow falling at Christmas

01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:04.840
 Like sleeping in on Sunday
Laughter we never faked

01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:09.340
 Bob Marley in summer
One love for each other

01:54:09.340 --> 01:54:10.350
 Oh, it feels like...

01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:15.850
 One love for each other
