WEBVTT

00:00.048 --> 00:01.257
My name is Talon.

00:01.260 --> 00:03.915
I'm the last Blackblood,
or so I've been told.

00:03.918 --> 00:06.554
I escaped when Everit
Dred killed all my people.

00:06.557 --> 00:09.558
I cut off the points of my
ears to hide in plain sight.

00:09.561 --> 00:11.691
A tiny creature lives inside me,

00:11.693 --> 00:13.564
passed to me by my dying mother.

00:13.567 --> 00:16.398
It gives me the power to
open portals to another world

00:16.401 --> 00:18.875
and summon powerful
demons called Lu-Qiri.

00:18.878 --> 00:21.455
But I can only summon them
when I have their names,

00:21.458 --> 00:23.570
something that's proving
to be a challenge.

00:23.573 --> 00:26.148
The Prime Order wants me dead,
but I have found sanctuary

00:26.151 --> 00:29.945
at the farthest edge of the Realm
in a place known as the Outpost.

00:29.948 --> 00:31.812
Previously on "The Outpost"...

00:31.815 --> 00:34.686
I have appointed Captain
Spears as base commander.

00:34.689 --> 00:38.429
What prize could be more valuable
than the head of the false queen

00:38.432 --> 00:40.554
or the corpse of the Blackblood?

00:40.557 --> 00:43.253
Both of which you've failed to procure.

00:43.256 --> 00:46.132
I bring you Commander Garret Spears.

00:46.135 --> 00:49.919
This is what the gods do to
those who serve a false queen.

00:51.227 --> 00:52.922
- Take your medicine.
- What is it?

00:52.924 --> 00:55.046
The reason you're alive.

00:55.049 --> 00:57.143
- I want you to guide him.
- Janzo?

00:57.146 --> 00:59.189
Make him into the man that
Talon needs in her life.

00:59.191 --> 01:01.703
You could be more if we,
um, fix you up a bit.

01:01.706 --> 01:02.540
Fix me up?

01:02.542 --> 01:05.859
I can provide you a sizeable
Blackblood army to defeat your enemy.

01:05.862 --> 01:08.371
You failed me, Dragman.

01:08.374 --> 01:10.187
Talon. A name.

01:10.190 --> 01:13.531
By the end of the week, Garret
Spears will be yours to command.

01:26.596 --> 01:31.555
How is it that a man who has spent
his entire life serving The Three

01:31.558 --> 01:35.388
is treated the same as a
traitor to the Covenant?

01:37.377 --> 01:38.639
Dred?

01:43.818 --> 01:46.384
Oh, whatever they've done to you,

01:46.386 --> 01:48.867
it isn't enough.

01:50.042 --> 01:53.000
They're a pack of fools.

01:53.002 --> 01:56.960
They want order, yet the don't have
the stomach to do what's necessary.

01:56.962 --> 01:59.180
Which is what?

01:59.182 --> 02:01.008
Murdering innocent people?

02:01.010 --> 02:05.099
If only I could show you
the visions I've seen.

02:05.101 --> 02:08.929
Hordes of demons
flooding across the land

02:08.931 --> 02:11.496
killing everything in their path.

02:11.498 --> 02:13.803
Women and children torn limb from limb

02:13.805 --> 02:16.153
as the Blackbloods conquer the Realm.

02:16.155 --> 02:20.549
Well, that sounds like
a really bad dream.

02:20.551 --> 02:21.854
It's no dream!

02:21.856 --> 02:24.596
It's prophecy.

02:24.598 --> 02:28.035
I killed the Blackbloods
to save the Realm,

02:28.037 --> 02:30.300
and this is the thanks I get.

02:32.606 --> 02:37.479
Surely that's not the only
reason you're in here.

02:37.481 --> 02:39.046
I didn't consult The Three

02:39.048 --> 02:41.091
before I killed the Blackbloods.

02:41.093 --> 02:44.268
But I didn't have time
to seek their approval.

02:44.270 --> 02:46.227
If I hadn't killed them there and then,

02:46.229 --> 02:49.491
they would have summoned their
demon army to wipe us all out.

02:49.493 --> 02:52.885
They were a peaceful people.

02:52.887 --> 02:54.452
We'll see if you still think that way

02:54.454 --> 02:57.238
when the last Blackblood
summons her demon army

02:57.240 --> 03:00.401
and kills everyone you care about.

03:00.404 --> 03:03.069
If she summons an army,

03:03.072 --> 03:06.682
she will be doing it to
defend the rightful queen.

03:06.684 --> 03:08.033
Rightful?

03:10.079 --> 03:11.904
You are so blinded by her beauty,

03:11.906 --> 03:13.863
you can't see the truth.

03:13.865 --> 03:15.865
She's a false queen,

03:15.867 --> 03:18.520
and you are just her puppet.

03:18.522 --> 03:20.698
She is not false.

03:23.135 --> 03:25.440
Do you know the real reason why Gwynn

03:25.442 --> 03:28.356
didn't let the Blackblood
kill me that night?

03:28.358 --> 03:31.707
So she could torture me to
find out what I had seen

03:31.709 --> 03:34.362
in the secret compartment
under her armoire.

03:34.364 --> 03:37.017
And what did you see?

03:37.019 --> 03:41.934
The last remaining portrait of
Princess Rosmund as a child.

03:41.936 --> 03:43.675
Calkussar had them all destroyed,

03:43.677 --> 03:46.113
but apparently Gwynn smuggled one

03:46.115 --> 03:48.769
as a keepsake of her childhood friend.

03:51.468 --> 03:52.902
You mean of herself?

03:52.904 --> 03:56.514
The girl in the portrait
looked a lot like Gwynn,

03:56.516 --> 03:59.126
it's true.

03:59.128 --> 04:04.087
But the real Rosmund
had a misshapen face

04:04.089 --> 04:07.395
from being kicked by a horse.

04:22.760 --> 04:25.328
- Are you all right?
- I've been better.

04:31.247 --> 04:33.725
- You'll pay for this.
- Yeah?

04:33.727 --> 04:36.554
Next time you will come
to collect his corpse.

04:36.556 --> 04:41.126
If I do, I'll be collecting
yours shortly thereafter.

04:47.089 --> 04:50.264
Hey, hey! We had a deal.

04:50.266 --> 04:52.572
A bigger cell if I told
him what you wanted.

05:13.506 --> 05:16.596
A bigger cell won't make
my fists hurt any less.

05:18.256 --> 05:25.287

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

05:30.114 --> 05:34.203
Talon, what are you doing up there?

05:34.206 --> 05:36.076
Going for a walk.

05:36.079 --> 05:38.601
Memorizing this name

05:38.604 --> 05:42.388
in case someone tries to steal it again.

05:42.391 --> 05:44.624
You know, it's our only one left.

05:44.627 --> 05:45.988
I know, Talon.

05:47.758 --> 05:49.351
Might be the only hope to summon help

05:49.354 --> 05:51.760
to fight Rebb's demon.

05:51.762 --> 05:55.633
What if the Lu-Qiri also
brings another Blackblood?

05:55.635 --> 05:59.507
Well, if there's any truth to
what Rebb said, it probably will.

05:59.509 --> 06:03.075
But... but if all the Blackbloods
are like Rebb, is it worth the risk?

06:03.077 --> 06:05.515
We might not have a choice.

06:10.259 --> 06:11.869
What are you doing?

06:18.658 --> 06:21.181
There. Leave it like that.

06:21.183 --> 06:22.660
You look cute.

06:22.662 --> 06:24.577
I do?

06:28.712 --> 06:30.538
What had gotten into you lately?

06:30.540 --> 06:33.889
Oh, please don't kill me! Please!

06:33.891 --> 06:36.283
It's just that Naya said that
if I took you in my arms

06:36.285 --> 06:38.676
and kissed you, that
you'd see me differently.

06:38.678 --> 06:41.679
Well, I am seeing you differently,
but not in a good way.

06:41.681 --> 06:44.465
Just ignore what Naya says.

06:44.467 --> 06:46.815
You're perfect the way you are.

06:46.817 --> 06:50.471
If I'm perfect, then why haven't
you fallen in love with me?

06:50.473 --> 06:53.125
'Cause I fell in love with you
the minute I saw you, Talon.

06:53.127 --> 06:55.345
Yeah, well, we don't
chose who we love, Janzo.

06:55.347 --> 06:58.305
Well, I'm sorry, but I
can't just switch it off,

06:58.307 --> 07:00.742
the way I feel about you.

07:00.744 --> 07:01.960
If my feelings were the same,

07:01.962 --> 07:04.180
I'd be the luckiest girl in the world.

07:04.182 --> 07:07.183
- Really?
- Really.

07:07.185 --> 07:10.752
And trust me, if my
feelings were to change,

07:10.754 --> 07:13.537
it would be for the
Janzo I've always known.

07:13.539 --> 07:15.976
Not this new version.

07:17.326 --> 07:18.760
So you're saying that eventually...

07:18.762 --> 07:21.241
I didn't say that at all.

07:21.243 --> 07:22.983
In, like, 10 or 20 moons, maybe?

07:25.203 --> 07:27.421
Maybe 30 or 40.

07:27.423 --> 07:29.033
I can wait!

07:52.883 --> 07:54.361
It's been a week.

07:54.363 --> 07:57.058
Healer Sana says you're
all right to walk around,

07:57.061 --> 07:58.914
but don't try to leave this room.

07:58.917 --> 08:01.629
This room is a prison to me.

08:01.631 --> 08:03.370
It's not that bad.

08:03.372 --> 08:05.197
This was once the royal suite,

08:05.199 --> 08:07.635
one of the most beautiful
rooms in the palace.

08:07.637 --> 08:08.940
This building was a palace?

08:08.942 --> 08:10.681
Mm-hmm. Before the purge.

08:10.683 --> 08:13.641
I served countless Lord Barons
in this very room in fact,

08:13.643 --> 08:16.426
for many years.

08:16.428 --> 08:20.038
It was different back then, of course.

08:20.040 --> 08:21.779
Luxuriously furnished.

08:21.781 --> 08:25.043
Gold leafing on the doorposts.

08:25.045 --> 08:28.571
And they plastered over
all the murals, of course.

08:30.312 --> 08:33.400
Can't have the royal family
still staring out at us,

08:33.402 --> 08:36.184
reminding us of the past can we?

08:39.277 --> 08:42.710
Garret, you're looking much better.

08:42.712 --> 08:43.975
How do you feel?

08:43.977 --> 08:45.847
I want to see the letter.

08:45.849 --> 08:49.067
What?

08:49.069 --> 08:50.332
Leave us.

08:58.078 --> 08:59.991
Why are you bringing that up?

08:59.993 --> 09:03.194
I have to know if what you said is true,

09:03.197 --> 09:04.605
about the message from Gwynn.

09:04.607 --> 09:07.569
You're in too fragile a state now.

09:07.572 --> 09:10.392
- Why don't we wait and see...
- If you don't want to show it to me,

09:10.395 --> 09:12.876
I can only assume it's a lie.

09:14.225 --> 09:15.269
All right.

09:17.707 --> 09:20.100
I only hope it's not
too painful for you.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.167
Where is the message?
He just asked for it.

09:45.169 --> 09:47.256
Almost done.

09:47.258 --> 09:50.085
You can't rush these things.

09:50.087 --> 09:52.609
I had to get three different dispatches

09:52.611 --> 09:55.135
in her handwriting to
piece this together.

09:56.354 --> 09:58.789
If he suspects anything,

09:58.791 --> 10:02.273
I'll kill you so slowly your
hair will grow back again.

10:50.669 --> 10:54.932
"Regarding the matter of Garret Spears,

10:54.934 --> 10:56.673
I alr...

10:58.938 --> 11:03.550
I already have a new base commander.

11:03.552 --> 11:06.857
Signed, Her Majesty,

11:06.859 --> 11:08.034
Queen Rosmund".

11:11.560 --> 11:13.385
I know her inscription
better than my own.

11:13.387 --> 11:17.346
I've read thousands of
notes written by her hand.

11:17.348 --> 11:19.611
And is that her handwriting?

11:23.180 --> 11:24.790
Yes, it is.

11:27.445 --> 11:29.489
She was using you.

11:29.491 --> 11:32.579
- You must see that now.
- Leave me alone.

11:32.581 --> 11:34.798
I didn't want to do this to you.

11:34.800 --> 11:38.280
Just get out.

11:38.282 --> 11:40.195
Garret, please.

11:40.197 --> 11:42.504
I need to be alone right now.

12:58.920 --> 13:01.241
The real Rosmund...

13:01.244 --> 13:03.722
had a misshapen face.

13:18.558 --> 13:19.646
Come in.

13:21.692 --> 13:24.954
Your Majesty, Baron Tobin
is here as you requested.

13:24.956 --> 13:27.595
- Send him in.
- He has a present for you.

13:27.598 --> 13:30.483
Oh, he does, does he?

13:39.274 --> 13:41.884
- Your Majesty.
- Master Tobin.

13:41.886 --> 13:43.581
I'm so glad you wanted to see me.

13:43.583 --> 13:45.365
Yes, well, I thought I at least

13:45.367 --> 13:47.803
owe you the courtesy of
getting to know you better

13:47.805 --> 13:49.761
if my decision to marry you or not

13:49.763 --> 13:51.154
is to be an informed decision.

13:51.156 --> 13:53.025
I couldn't agree more.

13:53.027 --> 13:56.333
I brought you a small token
of my love, my Queen.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.596
Hmm, thank you.

13:58.598 --> 14:02.382
I hope it's diamonds or gold
with which to pay my workers.

14:02.384 --> 14:03.906
That will come after we're married.

14:03.908 --> 14:05.433
If we're married.

14:05.436 --> 14:06.739
Open the gift.

14:06.742 --> 14:09.354
I must admit, I'm quite curious.

14:24.189 --> 14:27.886
This is perfect, is it not?

14:27.888 --> 14:29.583
It's for our wedding bed.

14:29.585 --> 14:31.335
Thank you, Tobin.

14:31.338 --> 14:34.414
You know, this lovely
gift shows me the nature

14:34.416 --> 14:36.765
of your character with amazing clarity.

14:36.767 --> 14:38.256
Yes, well, it's a man's job to...

14:38.259 --> 14:40.113
And that character is one of a snake

14:40.116 --> 14:42.771
eating its body from the tail end.

14:42.773 --> 14:44.860
I'm not sure I understand.

14:44.862 --> 14:46.600
You are a self-destructive,

14:46.602 --> 14:49.186
narcissistic, presumptuous libertine.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.170
You've set your cause
back immeasurably, Baron.

14:51.172 --> 14:52.694
- I have?
- Get out.

14:52.696 --> 14:55.829
- Just try it on.
- Get out!

15:04.664 --> 15:06.797
- Do you want it?
- Leave!

15:12.977 --> 15:16.848
Mmm. This... this tea is sublime.

15:16.850 --> 15:18.894
Did... did Janzo...

15:18.896 --> 15:20.678
Yeah, he has his uses sometimes.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.419
You're very lucky having
such devoted boys.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.770
- Mm-hmm.
- Where's Bill?

15:24.773 --> 15:27.250
Oh, a criminal I used to
know chopped his head off

15:27.252 --> 15:28.686
and sent it to me in a bag.

15:30.472 --> 15:31.862
Elinor, that's terrible.

15:31.865 --> 15:33.265
Oh, don't worry. I got my own back.

15:33.289 --> 15:34.779
Wythers let me gut the bum myself.

15:34.781 --> 15:38.261
All in the name of
justice, you understand.

15:38.263 --> 15:40.698
- Honey for your tea?
- Munt.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.700
- Hmm?
- Go away.

15:42.702 --> 15:45.487
Go away. Go away.

15:52.016 --> 15:54.059
- Something wrong, Ellie?
- Wrong?

15:54.061 --> 15:57.497
No, nothing's wrong.
Just, um, our mother died,

15:57.499 --> 15:59.369
and while she was dying,
she asked for you.

15:59.371 --> 16:00.979
She begged for you, but you never came,

16:00.981 --> 16:03.028
and I had to bury her all by myself.

16:03.031 --> 16:05.492
Little ten-year-old lass burying her

16:05.495 --> 16:07.481
all on her own, that's what's wrong.

16:07.484 --> 16:10.206
And as I've said many
times, I'm sorry for that.

16:10.208 --> 16:12.686
- But I'm here now.
- Yes, it's good you're here now.

16:12.688 --> 16:14.581
But don't worry. You being a horse's ass

16:14.584 --> 16:16.845
is part of why I am who I am today.

16:16.848 --> 16:17.937
A bar mistress?

16:19.695 --> 16:23.219
A very powerful woman.

16:23.221 --> 16:26.178
Hard as nails, take what I want,

16:26.180 --> 16:28.659
look after my friends, crush my enemies.

16:28.661 --> 16:32.195
I'm very well-respected
in this town, and, hell,

16:32.198 --> 16:34.970
I even know Her Majesty,
the Queen herself.

16:34.972 --> 16:37.581
Yes, well, I doubt that.

16:37.583 --> 16:40.018
It's actually true. I'm
friends with her as well.

16:40.020 --> 16:43.531
- Shut up, Janzo!
- Interesting.

16:43.534 --> 16:45.969
So tell me about her.

16:45.972 --> 16:46.975
What do you want to know?

16:46.978 --> 16:49.262
Well, let's start with the
treasury and the stores.

16:49.265 --> 16:50.899
Is it true she has nothing?

16:50.901 --> 16:52.946
Can't pay her soldiers or her workers?

16:56.384 --> 16:58.645
I see what you're doing!

16:58.647 --> 17:01.953
You're playing nice not because
you want to reconnect with me,

17:01.955 --> 17:03.781
but you want to pump me for information.

17:03.783 --> 17:06.305
I'm merely curious.

17:06.307 --> 17:08.176
Does Queen Rosmund even like men?

17:08.179 --> 17:10.796
Or is she more of a ladies'
lady, if you know what I mean?

17:10.799 --> 17:12.398
Why would you even suggest such a thing?

17:12.423 --> 17:13.499
Janzo, shut up!

17:13.502 --> 17:15.400
I mean, just look at my Baron.

17:15.403 --> 17:17.403
He's handsome, he's rich.

17:17.405 --> 17:20.406
Yet your Queen seems more
interested in her chambermaid.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.407
You think I'll give you
the Queen's secrets?

17:22.410 --> 17:25.281
Well, I won't. It's beneath
me. I am not a mole.

17:25.282 --> 17:29.111
Oh, please. You sell drink
and women for a living.

17:29.113 --> 17:30.242
Nothing's beneath you.

17:30.244 --> 17:31.809
I do not sell women!

17:31.811 --> 17:34.203
I am very, very
well-respected in this town.

17:34.205 --> 17:36.945
Yes, by who? The drunks and criminals?

17:36.947 --> 17:37.947
Maybe the sewer rats?

17:37.967 --> 17:40.122
And how are you any better, Aunt Gertie?

17:40.124 --> 17:43.647
Insulting your hostess? Your own sister?

17:43.649 --> 17:45.869
Is that your finest manners on display?

17:47.305 --> 17:49.522
No, Janzo. Of course,
you're quite right.

17:49.524 --> 17:52.221
So I shall take my leave in case
I say anything more regrettable.

17:52.223 --> 17:53.962
Good day to you, Janzo.

17:53.964 --> 17:55.443
And to you, Munt.

17:57.228 --> 18:00.057
It was lovely seeing you.
Let's do it again sometime!

18:02.450 --> 18:05.976
Munt, put the honey away!
You look ridiculous!

18:17.117 --> 18:19.206
People do respect you, Mother.

18:34.613 --> 18:38.920
Garret is dead, and Wythers never
even returned with his body.

18:38.922 --> 18:41.052
Talon is down to only one demon name,

18:41.054 --> 18:43.108
and the treasury is empty.

18:43.111 --> 18:45.274
I'm running out of options
that don't include Tobin,

18:45.276 --> 18:48.668
so please, give me some good news.

18:48.670 --> 18:51.584
I'm sorry, Miss, I can't
think of anything.

18:51.586 --> 18:54.239
How goes your work with
Talon and the brewer?

18:54.241 --> 18:57.112
It's precisely the sort of
thing I need to distract me.

18:57.114 --> 18:59.741
Well, he's making remarkable progress.

18:59.744 --> 19:01.590
He's looking handsome and confident.

19:01.593 --> 19:04.423
Splendid, and Talon is
responding to it well?

19:04.425 --> 19:06.711
Any moment now, I think he's
going to try and kiss her.

19:06.714 --> 19:08.732
- Fingers crossed.
- What?

19:08.734 --> 19:10.734
Oh, gods, no.

19:10.736 --> 19:12.954
Are you trying to have him killed?

19:12.956 --> 19:16.392
That's what he said.
Is he really in danger?

19:16.394 --> 19:18.524
Well, it's probably just a fat lip.

19:18.526 --> 19:20.962
Or a broken arm.

19:20.964 --> 19:23.140
Come in.

19:26.099 --> 19:28.752
Majesty, some woman called Rebb

19:28.754 --> 19:30.417
requests an audience with you.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.638
Bring more guards, a whole squad.

19:32.641 --> 19:36.150
You can send her in now, but make
absolutely certain she is unarmed.

19:36.153 --> 19:37.545
Yes, Majesty.

19:47.251 --> 19:48.556
That's close enough.

19:50.595 --> 19:52.943
Your Majesty.

19:52.946 --> 19:56.214
Perhaps you should start by confessing
to the murder of an innocent child.

19:56.217 --> 19:58.523
I did not such thing. What
would I stand to gain?

19:58.526 --> 20:01.567
To force my hand and order
Talon to give her power to you.

20:01.569 --> 20:04.788
All I want is for the portal to
be opened and the names called out.

20:04.790 --> 20:07.573
Whether by Talon or me is irrelevant.

20:07.575 --> 20:10.402
Killing the Dragman
only reduces my options.

20:10.404 --> 20:12.274
Really?

20:12.276 --> 20:16.017
Then you won't object to writing
the names right here and now?

20:16.019 --> 20:18.236
I have plenty of ink and parchment.

20:18.238 --> 20:20.978
And you'll force her to open
the portal and call the names?

20:20.980 --> 20:25.156
Even I can't force Talon to do anything.

20:25.158 --> 20:27.813
Then writing the names gains me nothing.

20:31.121 --> 20:33.904
What are you doing?

20:33.906 --> 20:36.559
When the Dragman died,

20:36.561 --> 20:39.605
I became the last hope for
you and your pitiful rebellion.

20:39.607 --> 20:42.391
Guards, arrest this woman.

20:42.393 --> 20:43.653
This doesn't have to happen.

20:43.655 --> 20:45.611
Help me summon my kinsmen,

20:45.613 --> 20:47.703
and we will win your war for you.

20:47.706 --> 20:49.575
You have my word.

20:49.578 --> 20:51.835
From what I've seen,
your word is worthless.

20:53.439 --> 20:54.743
What is going on out there?

20:54.745 --> 20:56.970
Guards!

21:13.137 --> 21:14.704
Pity.

21:17.428 --> 21:19.384
So many are dead.

21:19.386 --> 21:21.375
You're sure you want more to die?

21:22.554 --> 21:27.218
Oh. Don't worry, Your Highness.

21:27.220 --> 21:28.872
No harm will come to you

21:28.874 --> 21:32.658
as long as Talon does things my way.

21:40.717 --> 21:43.895
You, servant girl, bring Talon.

21:46.239 --> 21:47.978
And make it fast.

21:47.980 --> 21:50.678
Talon will never give
in to your demands.

21:52.680 --> 21:56.900
Do tell her, if I get impatient,

21:56.902 --> 21:59.163
I'll feed Ekkundi the Queen's toes

21:59.165 --> 22:00.906
one at a time.

22:02.690 --> 22:04.908
And when I run out of toes,

22:04.910 --> 22:07.173
I start cutting off fingers.

22:21.078 --> 22:23.674
And you never thought to
show me this gift first?

22:23.677 --> 22:25.764
Why? Hmm?

22:25.766 --> 22:29.246
It was a lovely, very expensive gift.

22:29.248 --> 22:30.985
The finest of silks.

22:30.988 --> 22:32.597
But not the gift for a queen.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.903
In her own words, you
have set your cause back.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.385
The Queen has been taken hostage!

22:38.387 --> 22:40.302
All hands to the Citadel!

22:43.915 --> 22:46.568
Now is your chance to redeem yourself.

22:46.570 --> 22:47.788
Go on.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.749
Sorry, excuse me. I must get through.

22:53.751 --> 22:55.707
Sorry. Pardon.

22:55.709 --> 22:58.101
Sorry, excuse me. Sorry, excuse me.

22:58.103 --> 23:01.172
Excuse me. I must get through.

23:01.175 --> 23:02.496
Sorry, excuse me.

23:04.718 --> 23:06.283
Oh.

23:06.285 --> 23:08.241
I was wondering when
you would come around.

23:08.243 --> 23:09.223
What?

23:09.225 --> 23:12.158
You throwing yourself
at me like this, Naya.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.900
You really are beautiful, you know that?

23:14.902 --> 23:17.424
I don't have time for this.
Have you seen Talon?

23:17.426 --> 23:18.997
Um, is she at the Night Shade?

23:19.000 --> 23:20.594
No, why?

23:20.597 --> 23:23.604
Queen Rosmund has been taken
hostage by the Blackblood woman.

23:23.607 --> 23:25.084
Talon's taken the Queen hostage?

23:25.086 --> 23:26.651
The other Blackblood.

23:26.653 --> 23:28.827
Oh, right. That sounds more right.

23:28.829 --> 23:31.395
Eh, don't worry. I'm going
to save the Queen now.

23:31.397 --> 23:35.355
I'll get you one day.

23:35.357 --> 23:38.447
Yes, well, somehow I
doubt you'll be much help.

23:39.710 --> 23:40.928
Oh, gods.

23:45.193 --> 23:49.195
The demon and the Blackblood
have Gwynn in the throne room.

23:49.197 --> 23:50.849
What? What does she want?

23:50.851 --> 23:53.243
- You.
- Then she can have me.

23:53.245 --> 23:55.114
- Where are you going?
- Going to save Gwynn.

23:55.116 --> 23:57.156
Are you mad? Rebb has a
demon. You've got no chance.

23:57.180 --> 23:58.465
Well, what do you suggest?

23:58.467 --> 23:59.989
You have to open the portal
and summon the demon.

23:59.991 --> 24:01.643
- You have the name.
- If I open that portal,

24:01.645 --> 24:03.245
there's no telling
what comes through it.

24:03.269 --> 24:05.164
It might be a Lu-Qiri
that can help you, Talon.

24:05.167 --> 24:06.949
And it might be a Lu-Qiri
with a Blackblood.

24:06.952 --> 24:08.737
Um, we don't have time for this.

24:08.739 --> 24:10.042
Of course, even with a Lu-Qiri,

24:10.044 --> 24:11.320
you might not be able to beat Rebb,

24:11.322 --> 24:12.842
but she does have the Queen hostage...

24:12.844 --> 24:14.444
Wait a minute, are you for or against me

24:14.468 --> 24:15.968
- calling the name?
- I don't know.

24:15.971 --> 24:17.493
I'm just thinking out loud.

24:17.496 --> 24:19.416
The Blackblood said if you
don't come right away,

24:19.418 --> 24:21.699
she's going to start cutting
off Gwynn's toes and fingers.

24:21.723 --> 24:23.226
That's a bit dramatic, isn't it?

24:23.229 --> 24:26.317
Her demon killed 20 men before
I could even take a breath.

24:26.320 --> 24:29.160
If there's any chance you could summon
one of those things for yourself,

24:29.184 --> 24:31.152
I think it might be warranted.

24:39.552 --> 24:41.770
This has all been unnecessary.

24:41.772 --> 24:45.512
We should be allies against
The Three, not adversaries.

24:47.865 --> 24:49.821
Who are you?

24:49.823 --> 24:52.043
I'm the man who's going
to save the Queen.

25:02.488 --> 25:03.532
Oh.

25:05.665 --> 25:08.057
Uh, are you seeing this, too?

25:08.059 --> 25:10.363
- Regrettably.
- Right.

25:10.365 --> 25:12.324
Okay, just wanted to make sure.

25:32.344 --> 25:34.563
What are you looking at?

25:46.391 --> 25:48.654
Every time I do this, it ends bad.

26:27.921 --> 26:29.181
Tell your beast to stand back

26:29.183 --> 26:32.317
or soon he'll have a new master.

26:35.112 --> 26:37.591
I'm going to open the portal
long enough for you to go back.

26:37.593 --> 26:39.682
Please do. Open it.

26:39.685 --> 26:41.757
Then I can summon more of my people.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.249
Wrong answer.

26:47.473 --> 26:49.473
Why isn't that thing
attacking us, or her?

26:49.475 --> 26:52.040
No one's ordered it to.

26:54.697 --> 26:57.115
- That's the order.
- What did he say?

26:57.118 --> 27:00.545
Educated guess? Something along
the lines of "Kill them all painfully".

27:02.538 --> 27:04.496
He told it not to hurt us.

27:05.713 --> 27:07.105
Bad call on his end.

27:14.848 --> 27:17.762
You understood me?

27:17.764 --> 27:19.894
Are you a Blackblood?

27:19.896 --> 27:23.071
- But your ears.
- I cut the points off.

27:23.073 --> 27:24.857
I'm getting sick of explaining it!

27:28.427 --> 27:29.471
Talon!

27:32.039 --> 27:33.345
Where's Rebb?

27:34.346 --> 27:36.171
What is she to you?

27:36.174 --> 27:37.759
She's the head of the Black Fist,

27:37.762 --> 27:39.693
the most warlike of the two clans.

27:39.696 --> 27:43.091
I asked what is she to you.

27:43.093 --> 27:45.180
She killed my sister.

27:45.182 --> 27:46.271
She's my enemy.

27:57.369 --> 27:59.284
What have you done with your hands?

28:00.676 --> 28:01.806
All my life,

28:01.808 --> 28:05.725
all of it... lies.

28:07.335 --> 28:09.901
This is why I didn't want
you to see the letter.

28:09.903 --> 28:14.035
I gave everything to
Calkussar and Gwynn.

28:14.037 --> 28:17.691
Everything. My whole life.

28:17.693 --> 28:21.347
And all that time, they
were just using me.

28:21.349 --> 28:25.133
I can't imagine how hurt
and angry you must feel.

28:25.135 --> 28:26.744
They took everything from me.

28:26.746 --> 28:29.052
Like the Blackblood did to me.

28:31.054 --> 28:32.706
I feel like such a fool.

28:32.708 --> 28:34.404
It's all right.

28:34.406 --> 28:36.319
Stay here.

28:36.321 --> 28:38.016
Stay with me.

28:38.018 --> 28:40.803
I'll take away all your pain.

29:00.127 --> 29:01.779
Why did you try to kill me?

29:01.781 --> 29:04.521
Says the one with the
sword to my throat.

29:04.523 --> 29:06.868
I had numerous chances to finish you,

29:06.871 --> 29:08.349
or to let Vikka do it.

29:08.352 --> 29:10.279
I've taken none of them.

29:10.282 --> 29:12.398
You, however, were aiming to kill.

29:12.400 --> 29:13.965
The last two Blackbloods I met

29:13.967 --> 29:15.880
killed innocent people I cared about.

29:15.882 --> 29:17.469
They were Black Fist.

29:17.472 --> 29:19.192
They believe the only
way to free our people

29:19.216 --> 29:20.751
is to wipe out all of the humans.

29:20.754 --> 29:22.790
But now she's taken the Queen hostage.

29:22.793 --> 29:25.633
And she won't release her until I
help her bring all of the Blackbloods.

29:25.657 --> 29:27.173
Not all of the Blackbloods.

29:27.176 --> 29:28.958
Her plan would be to
leave my clan behind

29:28.961 --> 29:31.460
because we believe we can
live in peace with humans.

29:31.463 --> 29:34.180
And that's why she killed the Dragman.

29:34.183 --> 29:36.465
Because with all of
the names lost forever,

29:36.468 --> 29:38.946
she can choose who she
brings through the portal,

29:38.948 --> 29:42.080
including leaving her
enemies, you, behind.

29:42.082 --> 29:46.389
- She killed the Dragman?
- Um, if I may?

29:46.391 --> 29:50.131
That other Blackblood could already be
feeding Gwynn's toes to that monster.

29:50.133 --> 29:52.063
No offense.

29:52.066 --> 29:54.719
Point me to her, and I swear
I'll kill Rebb or die trying.

29:54.722 --> 29:57.337
No. If vengeance for Rebb
is all you care about,

29:57.340 --> 29:59.040
then the Queen may die in battle.

29:59.043 --> 30:00.843
And why did you summon
me if not to kill Rebb?

30:00.867 --> 30:03.743
I didn't summon you. I summoned him.

30:03.746 --> 30:05.594
Relinquish his command to me.

30:07.334 --> 30:09.119
And why should I make concessions

30:09.122 --> 30:12.126
to an unarmed, defeated opponent? Hmm?

30:19.206 --> 30:23.034
- Is that better?
- Impressive.

30:23.036 --> 30:25.819
But still not good enough to beat Rebb.

30:25.821 --> 30:29.042
If I don't have to deal with her
Lu-Qiri, then I stand a chance.

30:34.613 --> 30:37.265
I'll return him if we both survive.

30:37.267 --> 30:38.443
You have my word.

30:39.770 --> 30:41.466
And why should I help you?

30:41.469 --> 30:43.183
You're offering me nothing in return.

30:43.186 --> 30:45.101
You know why.

30:46.712 --> 30:48.320
Are you promising to free our kindred?

30:48.322 --> 30:51.855
No. But it's the only
way you'll gain my trust.

30:54.148 --> 30:56.670
So you want me to give
up all of my advantage

30:56.673 --> 30:58.721
by sending Vikka probably to his death

30:58.724 --> 31:00.863
to save some human woman I've never met

31:00.866 --> 31:03.116
because it might help
me gain your trust?

31:03.119 --> 31:07.297
Yes.

31:08.274 --> 31:11.493
We'll fight her together.

31:11.496 --> 31:14.699
No. I don't trust you. You stay here.

31:20.006 --> 31:21.571
There you are.

31:21.573 --> 31:24.053
I was worried I lost my bargaining chip.

31:26.108 --> 31:29.807
I thought you might want to
choose which toe I cut off first.

31:36.732 --> 31:38.995
Choose, or I'll choose for you.

31:40.624 --> 31:41.973
Get away from her.

31:44.185 --> 31:45.979
There you are.

31:45.982 --> 31:48.835
I was beginning to wonder whether
she really meant anything to you.

31:48.838 --> 31:51.223
Let her go.

31:51.225 --> 31:54.226
And what will I get in return?

31:54.228 --> 31:56.445
I'll give you the Asterkinj.

31:56.447 --> 32:00.014
Really? That easily? Now
who's being deceptive?

32:00.016 --> 32:01.973
You said all you wanted
was the Asterkinj.

32:01.975 --> 32:05.019
Cut the Queen loose and you can have it.

32:05.021 --> 32:07.935
So you can put a knife to my
throat at the final moment

32:07.938 --> 32:10.197
like you did the last
time you cheated me?

32:10.200 --> 32:12.594
I won't make the trade
until she's set free.

32:14.290 --> 32:16.334
What are you up to?

32:16.337 --> 32:17.728
You'll never willingly allow me

32:17.730 --> 32:19.776
to unleash my warriors into this Realm.

32:19.779 --> 32:22.739
If there is no deal to be made, then
why in the gods are we all still here?

32:22.741 --> 32:24.741
The Asterkinj can't survive
outside a host body.

32:24.743 --> 32:27.206
Why is why you can't take it by force.

32:27.209 --> 32:28.818
I have to give it up willingly.

32:28.821 --> 32:30.170
Unless you're dead.

32:31.918 --> 32:34.701
It doesn't work like that.

32:34.703 --> 32:36.921
That is where you're mistaken.

32:36.923 --> 32:39.314
- Ekkundi?
- Talon, she's going to kill you!

32:47.281 --> 32:49.585
Patience, my friend.

32:49.587 --> 32:52.719
Like all living creatures, the
Asterkinji want to survive.

32:52.721 --> 32:57.724
So when your blood goes
still and cold in your veins,

32:57.726 --> 33:00.727
it will leave you like a
rat from a burning house.

33:00.729 --> 33:03.330
No wonder they locked you
up and threw away the key.

33:10.957 --> 33:12.132
Wait.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.744
You don't need the Queen anymore.

33:17.746 --> 33:18.746
She's nothing to you.

33:18.747 --> 33:19.852
Cut her loose,

33:19.855 --> 33:21.463
I'll drop my sword and die willingly.

33:21.466 --> 33:23.054
You're not in a position to bargain!

33:23.056 --> 33:25.587
If I fight, I'll do a lot of damage.

33:25.590 --> 33:29.331
You wouldn't want your Asterkinj
accidentally killed, would you?

33:29.334 --> 33:31.252
If I have to, I'll do it myself.

33:54.914 --> 33:57.373
Throw away your sword
and get on your knees!

33:57.376 --> 33:58.829
Not until she's through the door.

33:58.831 --> 34:00.831
You don't have to do this, Talon.

34:00.833 --> 34:04.423
- Just go.
- That's far enough.

34:04.426 --> 34:07.402
Throw away your sword or she
doesn't take another step.

34:12.844 --> 34:14.542
On your knees.

34:21.288 --> 34:22.942
Looks like you aren't the One.

34:24.955 --> 34:26.938
I'm the hero of the prophecy.

34:53.559 --> 34:55.342
Talon!

36:12.094 --> 36:14.320
I may not be the One,

36:14.323 --> 36:15.881
but neither are you.

36:23.453 --> 36:25.781
Remind me to put steel
bars on those windows.

36:34.535 --> 36:36.274
I told you to stay out of it.

36:36.277 --> 36:38.190
I was protecting my interests.

36:38.193 --> 36:42.110
Is that what I am to you? Your interest?

36:44.553 --> 36:46.074
Look, Vikka can't stay here.

36:46.076 --> 36:47.728
The people won't understand.

36:47.730 --> 36:50.165
I already sent him out
to the woods to hunt.

36:50.167 --> 36:52.082
Don't worry, he won't hunt humans.

36:54.258 --> 36:56.434
You might want to cover your ears.

37:03.964 --> 37:05.835
This belongs to you.

37:10.448 --> 37:11.841
Thank you.

37:15.062 --> 37:17.410
So do you trust me now?

37:17.412 --> 37:18.544
Should I?

37:20.531 --> 37:21.771
You're going to need to tell me

37:21.795 --> 37:24.933
everything that's happened
these past years.

37:25.202 --> 37:27.202
Well, for that, we're going
to need a few drinks.

37:27.204 --> 37:29.553
Come on.

37:29.555 --> 37:31.600
I'll show you the Night Shade.

37:43.438 --> 37:45.481
- You look so handsome.
- Thanks to you.

37:45.483 --> 37:47.527
Oh, no. Not me.

37:47.529 --> 37:50.008
Only the gods can take
credit for your countenance.

37:50.010 --> 37:52.619
Yes, but you can take credit
for pulling me back from death

37:52.621 --> 37:54.665
and building me up again.

37:54.667 --> 37:56.576
I can never repay you for that.

37:56.579 --> 37:59.663
You already repaid me with
something I desperately needed.

38:03.240 --> 38:04.370
Are you ready?

38:04.372 --> 38:06.810
I still don't understand
why we have to do all this.

38:06.813 --> 38:09.858
Because the only way you and I
can make a life in peace together

38:09.861 --> 38:11.643
is if The Three bless it.

38:11.646 --> 38:15.082
- You want it, don't you?
- More than anything.

38:15.085 --> 38:18.466
Remember everything I told
you, and you'll be fine.

38:18.469 --> 38:20.471
Come. We'll be late.

38:43.846 --> 38:45.672
I'm honored to bow before The Three

38:45.674 --> 38:48.544
and pledge my heart and blood.

38:48.546 --> 38:51.767
And who have you brought
before us, Healer?

38:54.988 --> 38:59.120
My Three, I present
Commander Garret Spears,

38:59.122 --> 39:01.993
formerly of Gallwood Outpost.

39:01.995 --> 39:04.693
You may stand.

39:08.305 --> 39:11.524
Your Holiness,

39:11.526 --> 39:13.765
Commander Spears has suffered greatly.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.746
He knows now that he
was under the influence

39:15.748 --> 39:17.731
of a deceptive commanding officer.

39:17.734 --> 39:20.620
I believe he's repentant
for his actions.

39:20.622 --> 39:24.582
What say you, Mr. Spears?

39:26.759 --> 39:29.760
I am honored to bow before The Three,

39:29.762 --> 39:32.545
and pledge my heart and blood.

39:32.547 --> 39:34.992
I shall serve you always,

39:34.995 --> 39:38.083
and shall not stray again.

39:38.086 --> 39:39.479
I am yours.
