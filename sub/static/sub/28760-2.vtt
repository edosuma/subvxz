POTE: Previously on
Queen of the South...

00:03.200 --> 00:05.168
TERESA: In the city we're
legitimate business owners.

00:05.270 --> 00:06.897
We have an
amazmg bartender.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.592
I have a student

00:08.700 --> 00:11.168
(tense music)

00:11.270 --> 00:12.202
TERESA:
We need a distributor.

00:12.310 --> 00:14.699
Raul Rodriguez, a Cuban
dealer out of Miami.

00:14.810 --> 00:15.731
GEORGE: They call him El Gordo.

00:15.840 --> 00:17.376
I can help you with supply.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.004
I don't need your product,
flaca.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.849
TERESA: If he believes
he doesn't need us,

00:20.950 --> 00:21.917
he won't make a deal.

00:22.020 --> 00:23.681
So we have to make
him need us.

00:23.790 --> 00:25.439
YOUNG GUY ONE:
Get out of the car now.

00:25.550 --> 00:28.348
My men got carjacked
and my cocaine is gone.

00:28.460 --> 00:29.882
This is how I smuggle
my product.

00:29.990 --> 00:32.129
TERESA: We ship bottles
of liquid cocaine.

00:32.230 --> 00:35.199
If you can get that cocaine
to Miami in 48 hours,

00:35.300 --> 00:37.188
you got yourself a new buyer.

00:37.300 --> 00:38.392
I'm Marcel Dumas.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.866
Marcel is the president
of the PCCC.

00:40.970 --> 00:42.699
People of Color Chamber
of Commerce.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.209
MARCEL: You can say that
I'm the welcoming committee.

00:44.310 --> 00:47.199
(suspenseful music)

00:47.310 --> 00:48.231
Let's go.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.205
(engine rewing)

00:50.310 --> 00:51.538
Hello?

00:51.650 --> 00:52.912
Someone's trying to kill me.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.442
*

00:54.550 --> 00:55.710
Tony!

00:58.590 --> 01:01.479
(suspenseful music)

01:01.590 --> 01:02.818
*

01:02.930 --> 01:04.079
Eww!

01:04.190 --> 01:06.954
(laughter and applause)

01:07.060 --> 01:09.221
Oh, God! Ooh!

01:09.330 --> 01:11.662
(laughter)

01:11.770 --> 01:13.169
What the hell is that, anyway?

01:13.270 --> 01:15.067
That's the name of the game.
That's--

01:15.170 --> 01:17.058
-You're supposed to guess.
-Mierda, that's my guess.

01:17.170 --> 01:18.603
(gags)

01:18.710 --> 01:20.177
I'll tell you one thing,
I'm not gonna feed my kid

01:20.280 --> 01:22.077
any of that vegetarian crap.

01:22.180 --> 01:25.001
He's going on a strict diet
of tripas and leche.

01:25.110 --> 01:26.839
You're having a boy?

01:26.950 --> 01:28.315
No.
I mean, I don't know.

01:28.420 --> 01:30.581
I-I told you,
Chino's making us wait.

01:30.690 --> 01:31.611
You said "he."

01:31.720 --> 01:33.654
Okay, I--no more baby talk.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.910
Let's get this party started!

01:36.020 --> 01:40.457
Banda, penis cakes,
strippers, algo hombre!

01:40.560 --> 01:41.595
You said "he."

01:41.700 --> 01:44.168
Ay, don't be such a mensa.

01:44.270 --> 01:45.692
Look at that.
So disgusting.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.597
I gotta change my blouse.

01:47.700 --> 01:50.100
(Spanish music playing)

01:50.210 --> 01:53.134
*

01:53.240 --> 01:55.970
Oh.
What do you think?

01:56.080 --> 01:57.707
You said "he."

01:57.810 --> 01:59.846
Ay, metich you're not
gonna let it go, are you?

01:59.950 --> 02:02.487
Oy.
Okay.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.943
Okay, I'm only telling you this
because you're my best friend,

02:04.050 --> 02:05.381
but don't let that get
to your head.

02:05.490 --> 02:06.650
(laughs)

02:06.760 --> 02:08.716
Okay, and you have to promise me
you won't tell anyone.

02:08.820 --> 02:10.629
-Not even Guero.
-I promise.

02:10.730 --> 02:13.198
Okay.
I am having a boy.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.528
Oh, my God!
A boy!

02:15.830 --> 02:17.297
Chino doesn't know?

02:17.400 --> 02:19.391
No, no, he's got
some weird superstition.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.207
He made me swear we wouldn't
find out until the birth.

02:22.310 --> 02:25.199
But you know me.
I don't like pinche surprises.

02:25.310 --> 02:27.232
But you'd better act pinche
surprised at the hospital.

02:27.340 --> 02:29.342
-I will. Iwill! Oh, my God!
-Oh!

02:29.450 --> 02:30.678
A little Chinito!

02:30.780 --> 02:32.839
No.
I'm gonna name him Tony.

02:32.950 --> 02:34.577
-After your dad?
-No'mbre, no.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.545
Tony Montana.

02:36.650 --> 02:38.982
"Say hello
to my little friend."

02:39.090 --> 02:41.411
Oh, my God!
You're having a son!

02:41.520 --> 02:44.580
(both laughing)

02:53.540 --> 02:54.689
(indistinct radio chatter)

02:54.800 --> 02:58.099
(cell phone buzzing)

02:59.840 --> 03:00.909
-(beeps)
-Si.

03:01.010 --> 03:03.240
Where are you?

03:03.350 --> 03:05.409
I just got to Tony's school.

03:05.510 --> 03:06.772
TERESA: Did you find him?

03:08.880 --> 03:10.745
TERESA: Pote?

03:13.090 --> 03:14.751
Pote?

03:14.860 --> 03:16.589
Not yet.

03:17.930 --> 03:19.522
I'm coming down.

03:19.630 --> 03:20.892
TERESA: I can be at
the airport in an hour.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.797
No, Teresita.
We talked about this.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.197
This could be an ambush.

03:24.300 --> 03:25.790
He's depending on me.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.390
A lot of people depending
on you now.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.138
POTE: Not just Tony.

03:29.240 --> 03:32.403
But if someone is after him,
they're after you too.

03:32.510 --> 03:34.068
POTE: Iwill call you
when I know something.

03:34.180 --> 03:35.636
Bye.

03:35.740 --> 03:38.641
(suspenseful music)

03:38.750 --> 03:42.743
*

03:42.850 --> 03:44.147
JAVIER: This is where
we make the handoff.

03:44.250 --> 03:45.786
El Gordo's men
should be inside.

03:45.890 --> 03:52.728
*

04:07.310 --> 04:10.302
(jazzy music playing)

04:10.410 --> 04:13.277
*

04:13.380 --> 04:14.813
Two coffees to go.

04:14.920 --> 04:21.780
*

04:35.700 --> 04:37.008
(truck horn honking)

04:37.970 --> 04:40.336
BOBBY: Whoa, whoa.

04:40.440 --> 04:41.771
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.302
LOUIS: I can't see shit.

04:43.410 --> 04:44.502
Come on.
Come on, move.

04:44.610 --> 04:45.599
Get out of there.
Shit.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.655
(suspenseful music)

04:52.760 --> 04:54.011
*

04:54.120 --> 04:56.520
BOBBY: What's this guy doing?
Move!

04:56.630 --> 04:59.451
(scoffs)

04:59.560 --> 05:01.118
*

05:01.230 --> 05:03.198
Shit. They're on the move.
Let's go.

05:03.300 --> 05:04.619
BOBBY: We're taking
this tequila truck.

05:04.730 --> 05:05.662
Yeah, it's me.

05:05.770 --> 05:08.568
We're heading east
on Pearl River.

05:08.670 --> 05:11.366
(cell phone buzzes, beeps)

05:12.910 --> 05:14.969
Hey, good morning.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.479
EDDIE: You don't sound
so good.

05:16.580 --> 05:17.877
Let me guess.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.472
You're giving up the piano.

05:23.890 --> 05:26.552
I knew I shouldn't have
kissed you last night.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.548
I'm sorry.
I crossed the line.

05:28.660 --> 05:31.481
No, no.

05:31.590 --> 05:32.557
It's not you.

05:32.660 --> 05:34.992
It's just,
I didn't sleep last night.

05:35.100 --> 05:38.365
My godson, he ran away.

05:38.470 --> 05:41.234
I'm so sorry.
Is there anything I can do?

05:41.340 --> 05:43.331
No, thank you.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.930
We have people looking for him.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.371
EDDIE: Don't worry.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.368
One thing I know,
boy that age eats half

05:48.480 --> 05:50.175
his body weight every two days.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.009
(chuckles)

05:52.110 --> 05:54.340
He'll turn up
soon as he gets hungry.

05:54.450 --> 05:56.941
I hope so.

05:57.050 --> 05:58.347
EDDIE: You'll see.

05:58.450 --> 06:01.613
In the meantime,
if anything comes up,

06:01.720 --> 06:03.688
ifI can help in any way...

06:04.630 --> 06:06.120
Give me a call.

06:06.230 --> 06:08.289
I will.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.890
Thank you.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.024
EDDIE: See you around.

06:11.130 --> 06:12.222
Okay, bye.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.729
(phone beeps)

06:13.840 --> 06:16.729
(dramatic music)

06:16.840 --> 06:23.700
*

06:26.720 --> 06:27.641
Hey.

06:28.750 --> 06:29.978
We got company.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.118
Raul.

06:38.230 --> 06:40.255
Flaca.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.396
I got word our handoff
was complete,

06:42.500 --> 06:44.491
so I thought I'd stop by
for a toast.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.761
It's a little early for me.

06:46.870 --> 06:49.600
Ah, I'm on Miami time.
Come on, humor me.

06:49.710 --> 06:56.400
*

07:03.450 --> 07:06.908
Aww, come on.
What is this?

07:13.130 --> 07:19.990
*

07:33.520 --> 07:35.317
Now let's speak
the truth between us.

07:36.520 --> 07:39.557
It was you who ripped off
my shipment, wasn't it?

07:40.990 --> 07:42.355
EL GORDO: Hmm?
Come on.

07:42.460 --> 07:43.825
You already asked me that.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.886
Ah, circumstances were
different then.

07:45.990 --> 07:47.321
We're partners now.
Come on.

07:47.430 --> 07:49.318
*

07:49.430 --> 07:50.829
Come on, you can tell me.

07:50.930 --> 07:57.802
*

08:06.250 --> 08:07.512
Shit!

08:07.620 --> 08:08.848
(tires squealing)

08:08.950 --> 08:10.383
(intense music)

08:10.490 --> 08:12.219
Shit, shit.
Damn it!

08:12.320 --> 08:13.389
Jesus.

08:13.490 --> 08:14.411
*

08:14.520 --> 08:15.487
Ah!

08:15.590 --> 08:16.887
*

08:16.990 --> 08:20.391
I'm not angry.
It's okay.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.924
It's just, you know, I--

08:24.030 --> 08:26.066
I like to know
who I'm dealing with.

08:26.170 --> 08:27.694
*

08:27.800 --> 08:31.406
I told you,
it wasn't me.

08:31.510 --> 08:35.833
*

08:35.940 --> 08:37.942
VVhat?
Huh?

08:38.050 --> 08:40.041
(groaning)

08:40.150 --> 08:43.210
(all grunting)

08:43.320 --> 08:46.084

08:55.960 --> 08:59.589

EL GORDO:
You should see your face.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.377
(laughing)

09:07.480 --> 09:08.936
It's okay.
I told you.

09:09.040 --> 09:12.771
It's all water under the bridge
now that you've made me whole.

09:17.320 --> 09:20.312
But if it happens again,

09:20.420 --> 09:23.218
that'll be
a different kind of visit.

09:23.330 --> 09:26.219
(suspenseful music)

09:26.330 --> 09:28.719
*

09:28.830 --> 09:31.663
EL GORDO: (laughing)

09:31.770 --> 09:38.630
*

09:46.450 --> 09:47.610
-(recorded voice message)
-Pinche Chino.

09:47.720 --> 09:48.641
(phone beeps)

09:49.850 --> 09:51.112
He was supposed to be back
three hours ago.

09:51.220 --> 09:52.312
They're working.

09:52.420 --> 09:53.648
Call Guero.
See if he'll pick up.

09:56.460 --> 09:58.189
It's not good for the baby.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.923
Do you ever worry about Guero
when he goes out on these runs?

10:08.840 --> 10:10.102
Yeah, sometimes.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.600
Every time Chino walks
out that door,

10:12.710 --> 10:14.678
I wonder if it's the last time
I'm gonna see him.

10:19.780 --> 10:23.443
Baby showers and funerals.

10:23.550 --> 10:25.211
That's what marks
this life for us.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.209
(dramatic music)

10:28.320 --> 10:32.120
*

10:32.230 --> 10:33.549
Can I ask you something?

10:33.660 --> 10:39.394
*

10:39.500 --> 10:41.536
Would you be Tony's godmother?

10:41.640 --> 10:43.631
*

10:43.740 --> 10:45.799
-Yes, of course.
-No, listen to me.

10:45.910 --> 10:47.377
No, 'cause I'm not
talking about

10:47.480 --> 10:49.300
just a godmother who's gonna

10:49.410 --> 10:52.208
pose for the baptism photos.

10:52.310 --> 10:57.680
What I mean is if something
happens to Chino or me,

10:57.790 --> 10:59.712
will you take care of him?

10:59.820 --> 11:01.310
Yes, of course.

11:24.050 --> 11:25.244
Move it back.
Move it back.

11:25.350 --> 11:27.716
You can't cross the tape, kids.
Okay?

11:27.820 --> 11:29.788
(indistinct chatter)

11:36.890 --> 11:38.118
Can't be over here, sir.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.095
I heard a boy was killed
here last night.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.395
My--my son comes to this school
and I can't get a hold of him.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.569
I'm sorry.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.069
I can't give out
any information.

11:45.170 --> 11:46.421
The parents are gathering
at the command center.

11:46.530 --> 11:47.531
-Where's that?
-Right up here.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.801
-(grunts)
-Come here.

11:49.910 --> 11:50.865
Easy.

11:50.970 --> 11:51.902
Sleep.

11:52.010 --> 11:54.570
Just go to sleep.

11:57.380 --> 11:59.405
Sweet dreams, cabron.

12:01.420 --> 12:04.309
(suspenseful music)

12:04.420 --> 12:10.154
*

12:10.260 --> 12:12.455
Let's try to stack these
three high.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.961
Hey, I wanted a liquor truck,
not a hostage.

12:19.070 --> 12:20.298
Driver pulled a gun.

12:21.900 --> 12:23.436
Went all Dirty Harry on us.

12:25.070 --> 12:26.799
How bad is it?

12:26.910 --> 12:28.275
He'll live.

12:28.380 --> 12:31.247
Don't make no sense, though.
Driver's packing?

12:31.350 --> 12:32.669
That's what the insurance
IS for, right?

12:47.860 --> 12:49.293
Take off his gag.

12:55.940 --> 12:58.329
What's on the truck?
Fentanyl?

12:58.440 --> 13:01.500
H?
I'm betting a little cocana.

13:03.610 --> 13:04.645
I don't know what
you're talking about.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.149
Oh, that's bullshit.

13:06.250 --> 13:08.639
Two armed Latinos driving
a truck to Miami--

13:08.750 --> 13:11.685
Hey, I've never been
on this end of the profiling,

13:11.790 --> 13:14.611
but you and I both know
that means one thing.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.382
It's just tequila.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.496
Yeah?

13:20.600 --> 13:22.989
We gonna find out
soon enough, yeah?

13:23.100 --> 13:24.727
You tear that truck apart.

13:31.210 --> 13:35.977
DUMAS: Ooh,
how you doing, champ?

13:36.080 --> 13:37.377
Think I need a doctor.

13:39.010 --> 13:40.011
Think I'm dying, bro.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.542
No, man.
It's just a scratch.

13:41.650 --> 13:44.084
Your ass is gonna be all right.

13:44.190 --> 13:46.579
The hell's wrong with you, man?
Sip on this.

13:46.690 --> 13:47.987
It'll ease the pain.

13:50.060 --> 13:53.393
Oh!
Tastes like shit!

13:53.500 --> 13:55.923
Well, man, it ain't bourbon,
but that shit's gonna help.

13:56.030 --> 13:57.588
DUMAS: Come on, man.
Man up.

13:59.330 --> 14:01.992
There you go.
The hell's wrong with you?

14:02.100 --> 14:03.328
Let's go.
Come on.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.603
(suspenseful music)

14:06.710 --> 14:08.598
*

14:08.710 --> 14:10.598
(groans)

14:10.710 --> 14:17.582
*

14:30.570 --> 14:37.430
*

14:55.660 --> 14:57.548
Tony's not in the school.

14:57.660 --> 15:00.390
Tony has an uncle who lives
an hour from there.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.649
I found him on Facebook.

15:01.760 --> 15:03.967
POTE: Pinche social media.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.391
Must have been how
the sicarios tracked him down.

15:06.500 --> 15:07.637
TERESA: I'll text you
the address.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.934
I'll check it out.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.268
I'll meet you there.
Bye.

15:10.370 --> 15:11.302
-POTE: Teresa.
-(phone beeps)

15:11.410 --> 15:13.139
Teresita.

15:13.240 --> 15:16.232
-(car engine starts)
-Always the hard way.

15:16.340 --> 15:17.841
(car engine rewing)

15:17.950 --> 15:19.303
We're going to the airport.

15:19.410 --> 15:21.674
(cell phone buzzing)

15:21.780 --> 15:23.316
-It's El Gordo.
-(phone beeps)

15:23.420 --> 15:24.614
Yes?

15:26.520 --> 15:27.487
What are you talking about?

15:27.590 --> 15:29.353
My truck was hijacked.

15:29.460 --> 15:32.179
(suspenseful music)

15:32.290 --> 15:33.757
*

15:33.860 --> 15:35.157
We made the handoff.

15:35.260 --> 15:36.852
Nothing went wrong on my end.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.767
Well, things have been
going wrong on my end

15:38.870 --> 15:40.337
ever since we met.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.863
This is the second load.
I warned you, flaca.

15:42.970 --> 15:44.528
I have a shipment coming
in this week.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.130
I can replace it.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.504
What about my nephew?
He was driving the truck.

15:48.610 --> 15:50.202
EL GORDO: If anything
happens to him,

15:50.310 --> 15:51.971
it's not just the coke
you'll owe me.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.718
I'll be coming for blood.

15:53.820 --> 15:58.018
*

16:02.720 --> 16:04.278
Did you find the truck?

16:04.390 --> 16:07.848
According to GPS, truck's
outside a warehouse in Slidell.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.167
That's just outside the city.

16:10.270 --> 16:13.330
Think this has anything
to do with Tony?

16:13.440 --> 16:14.862
I don't know.

16:14.970 --> 16:16.699
No, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.006
I'm coming with you.

16:18.110 --> 16:19.236
No, that--that is not
a good idea.

16:19.340 --> 16:21.069
JAVIER: No, no, no, he's right.

16:21.180 --> 16:22.704
Patrona, we have no idea
who or what we're gonna find

16:22.810 --> 16:23.742
at that warehouse.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.501
If I stay, I'm a target.

16:26.610 --> 16:27.838
Let's go.

16:27.950 --> 16:30.714
(suspenseful music)

16:30.820 --> 16:33.880
All right, boys,
let's saddle up.

16:33.990 --> 16:36.185
*

16:42.530 --> 16:45.522
(buzzing)

16:48.200 --> 16:49.337
It's empty.

16:49.440 --> 16:50.509
Maybe we missed something.

16:50.610 --> 16:51.929
DUMAS: No, it's here.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.678
I can feel it.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.736
Only other place it could be
is welded into the frame.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.104
But we'd have to remove
the chassis.

16:58.210 --> 16:59.939
I got a better idea.

17:00.050 --> 17:03.713
(suspenseful music)

17:03.820 --> 17:05.913
He's gonna tell us
where it is.

17:06.020 --> 17:07.783
*

17:07.890 --> 17:09.858
Or I'm gonna take him apart.

17:09.960 --> 17:11.257
(glass shatters)

17:11.360 --> 17:13.726
(groaning)

17:13.830 --> 17:15.752
(gagging)

17:15.860 --> 17:18.863
(choking)

17:20.740 --> 17:26.531
*

17:26.640 --> 17:27.777
He's gone.

17:27.880 --> 17:34.740
*

18:04.350 --> 18:06.341
You don't know who
you're messmg wrth.

18:06.450 --> 18:09.146
(gun cocking)

18:09.250 --> 18:11.184
How about you tell me?

18:11.290 --> 18:14.282
(engine rumbling)

19:04.570 --> 19:07.573
(door squeaks)

19:08.910 --> 19:11.902
(tense music)

19:12.010 --> 19:13.739
(water dripping)

19:29.000 --> 19:32.527
According to GPS,
truck's still in there.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.564
One way in
and one way out.

19:34.670 --> 19:36.865
(cell phone buzzes)

19:36.970 --> 19:38.232
(cell phone beeps)

19:38.340 --> 19:39.534
Did you find the house?

19:39.640 --> 19:42.609
Yeah, but not before
the sicarios.

19:42.710 --> 19:44.246
Tony?

19:44.350 --> 19:46.568
He was here,

19:46.680 --> 19:48.671
but it seems like he got away.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.382
TERESA: How do you know?

19:51.490 --> 19:53.355
They tortured his tio
to death.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.953
I know you don't want to listen
to this, Teresita.

19:57.060 --> 19:59.085
I'm not coming.

19:59.190 --> 20:01.249
El Gordo's shipment
was hijacked this morning.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.089
Puta madre.
By who?

20:03.200 --> 20:04.622
We don't know.

20:04.730 --> 20:05.867
We just found the truck.
We're gonna check it out.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.128
POTE: Maybe I should
come back.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.401
TERESA: No.
We can handle this.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.569
Just find Tony
and bring him home, okay?

20:12.670 --> 20:14.479
Be careful, Teresita.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.707
You too.
Bye.

20:26.420 --> 20:29.309
(suspenseful music)

20:29.420 --> 20:36.292
*

21:02.820 --> 21:09.658
*

21:18.670 --> 21:21.002
(air hissing)

21:21.110 --> 21:27.970
*

21:32.320 --> 21:35.312
(beeping)

21:49.340 --> 21:51.558
It's the truck's GPS.

21:51.670 --> 21:53.501
*

21:53.610 --> 21:54.736
JAVIER: And that's our bottle.

21:54.840 --> 22:01.541
*

22:09.020 --> 22:11.921
(suspenseful music)

22:12.030 --> 22:18.890
*

22:21.840 --> 22:23.660
Patrona, what are we gonna do?

22:23.770 --> 22:26.000
Scale of one to ten,
how close do you think

22:26.110 --> 22:28.408
El Gordo is to his nephew?

22:28.510 --> 22:30.569
BIRDIE: Teresa?

22:30.680 --> 22:33.069
(suspenseful music)

22:33.180 --> 22:34.716
GEORGE: That answers
that question.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.879
TERESA: She has nothing
to do with this.

22:36.980 --> 22:38.686
Let her go and we can talk.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.417
Unless you're telling me
where my nephew is,

22:40.520 --> 22:42.215
that's not gonna happen.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.287
If he blinks,
take his head off.

22:43.390 --> 22:44.857
You'll die first, Gordito.

22:44.960 --> 22:46.757
TERESA: We die here,
your nephew, wherever he is,

22:46.860 --> 22:47.849
dies with us.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.463
Or maybe he's already dead.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.720
We don't know that.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.593
Are you willing
to take that chance?

22:54.700 --> 23:01.299
*

23:01.410 --> 23:04.709
Javier, George,
put the gun down.

23:04.810 --> 23:06.300
*

23:06.410 --> 23:08.913
Do it.

23:09.020 --> 23:12.911
You asked me to have a drink
with you earlier.

23:13.020 --> 23:14.817
Have a drink with me now?

23:14.920 --> 23:21.792
*

23:27.600 --> 23:29.090
Let's speak the truth
between us.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.658
*

23:32.770 --> 23:33.737
Okay.

23:33.840 --> 23:40.609
*

23:50.760 --> 23:52.421
I lied to you earlier.

23:52.530 --> 23:55.954
You asked if it was me
who stole your shipment.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.869
You're right.
It was.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.665
*

23:59.770 --> 24:01.328
EL GORDO: Why are you
telling me this?

24:01.440 --> 24:03.260
Because I need you to
believe me when I tell you

24:03.370 --> 24:05.338
that what happened today,
it wasn't me.

24:05.440 --> 24:07.305
But you lied to me then.
Why should I believe you now?

24:07.410 --> 24:08.832
Because you and I both
want the same thing.

24:08.940 --> 24:10.476
And what is that?

24:10.580 --> 24:13.447
A strong partnership
and your nephew's safe return.

24:13.550 --> 24:14.869
You don't give a shit
about my nephew.

24:14.980 --> 24:16.516
TERESA: You're wrong.

24:16.620 --> 24:19.214
I know how hard it is
to lose people you love

24:19.320 --> 24:21.117
because of this business.

24:21.220 --> 24:23.950
And you will again
if anything happens to him.

24:24.060 --> 24:26.528
No one knew about the load
except for my nephew,

24:26.630 --> 24:27.824
you, and your people.

24:27.930 --> 24:30.899
(phone ringing)

24:36.370 --> 24:37.962
(phone ringing)

24:40.680 --> 24:42.898
(beeps)

24:43.010 --> 24:45.399
Hello?

24:45.510 --> 24:47.000
DUMAS: I heard you had
a little problem.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.010
TERESA: Who is this?

24:50.220 --> 24:52.313
Marcel Dumas.

24:52.420 --> 24:54.411
What do you know
about my problem?

24:54.520 --> 24:57.011
DUMAS: I know you're missing
some valuable merchandise.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.849
I can provide some assistance.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.427
In exchange for what?

25:00.530 --> 25:01.929
DUMAS: Not over the phone.

25:02.030 --> 25:04.498
Come by my club
and we can discuss.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.761
*

25:06.870 --> 25:08.428
(phone beeps)

25:08.540 --> 25:10.906
That was a ransom call.

25:11.010 --> 25:14.002
A man named Dumas
has your load.

25:14.110 --> 25:15.270
And my nephew?

25:15.380 --> 25:16.836
I believe he's alive.

25:16.940 --> 25:17.907
Otherwise he wouldn't
have made the call.

25:18.010 --> 25:19.238
Take me to him.

25:19.350 --> 25:20.772
TERESA: He told me
to come alone.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.678
We show up like this,
your nephew's dead.

25:23.790 --> 25:26.350
Now how do I know you're
not gonna skip out on me?

25:26.450 --> 25:28.281
GEORGE: I'll stay.

25:28.390 --> 25:32.383
*

25:32.490 --> 25:34.424
Keep him on ice for you.

25:34.530 --> 25:39.968
*

25:40.070 --> 25:42.061
Okay, the gringo
and the girl stay.

25:42.170 --> 25:43.535
TERESA: She has nothing
to do with this.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.198
It was not a request.

25:45.310 --> 25:52.148
*

25:55.920 --> 25:56.909
One more thing.

25:57.020 --> 25:58.942
*

25:59.050 --> 26:01.211
By the time I finish this cigar
if you're not back

26:01.320 --> 26:03.049
with my nephew,
you're dead.

26:03.160 --> 26:09.998
*

26:19.740 --> 26:20.900
-(Kelly Anne shouting)
-(grunts)

26:21.010 --> 26:22.432
-(gunshot)
-(both shouting)

26:22.540 --> 26:23.643
Pote?

26:25.010 --> 26:26.272
Pote?

26:26.380 --> 26:27.642
Tony!

26:27.750 --> 26:28.671
Come over here!

26:28.780 --> 26:29.815
What?
No!

26:29.920 --> 26:31.444
What are you doing?
She's with me.

26:31.550 --> 26:33.415
-(tree branch snaps)
-(gunfire)

26:33.520 --> 26:34.919
Come on!
Go!

26:35.020 --> 26:36.658
-KELLY ANNE: Go, go, go, go!
-POTE: Go!

26:36.760 --> 26:38.648
(gunfire)

26:46.970 --> 26:48.494
POTE: Over there.
Go.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.501
(suspenseful music)

26:51.610 --> 26:53.100
Get down!

26:53.210 --> 26:54.370
How many are there?

26:54.480 --> 26:55.469
I don't know.
I think two.

26:55.580 --> 26:57.275
All right, Tony, you stay here.

26:57.380 --> 26:58.608
You and I are gonna see what's
on the other side of that tree.

26:58.710 --> 26:59.677
TONY: No, I'll come with you.

26:59.780 --> 27:00.872
Just give me a gun.

27:00.980 --> 27:02.516
Are you crazy?

27:02.620 --> 27:03.814
Look, I know how to use it.
Teresa taught me.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.148
No, it's true.
I was there.

27:05.250 --> 27:06.342
_ This is not _
a pinche negotiation.

27:06.450 --> 27:07.951
I'm here to protect you.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.516
You have to listen
to what I'm saying.

27:09.620 --> 27:11.156
He's right.
Take this.

27:11.260 --> 27:12.522
We'll be back.
We'll be back.

27:12.630 --> 27:13.722
-I promise, okay?
-Stay down.

27:13.830 --> 27:15.388
-You, go.
-KELLY ANNE: Okay, okay!

27:21.900 --> 27:23.902
(grunts)

27:24.010 --> 27:25.466
-You're supposed to be dead.
-I know, I know.

27:25.570 --> 27:26.901
-Please let me explain.
-Start talking.

27:27.010 --> 27:29.331
-James let me go.
-No, he shot you.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.374
No, you walked away,
remember?

27:31.480 --> 27:36.349

KELLY _ANNE:

(gunshot)

27:43.660 --> 27:47.699
*

27:47.800 --> 27:49.688
Why did he let you live?

27:49.800 --> 27:50.892
I don't know.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.422
He couldn't do it, I guess.

27:52.530 --> 27:54.066
But he let me go and I went
straight into hiding.

27:54.170 --> 27:55.592
And how'd you end up here?

27:55.700 --> 27:57.861
Tony and I had a system
if he ever got in trouble.

27:57.970 --> 27:59.528
He would ping me on the app.

27:59.640 --> 28:01.335
He said his roommate had been
shot and a bunch of guys

28:01.440 --> 28:02.702
were running after him
so I got in my car

28:02.810 --> 28:04.402
and I drove down here
as fast as I could.

28:04.510 --> 28:06.341
Knowing that you would be
killed on sight?

28:08.080 --> 28:09.240
He was in trouble.

28:10.520 --> 28:11.612
So yeah.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.717
(suspenseful music)

28:14.820 --> 28:15.752
-Get down!
-(shouts)

28:25.370 --> 28:26.928
Pote's still not answering.

28:27.030 --> 28:28.588
Got other things
to worry about now.

28:36.580 --> 28:38.241
Your friend has
to wait outside.

28:38.350 --> 28:39.578
That's bullshit.

28:41.250 --> 28:42.945
It's okay.

28:43.050 --> 28:44.381
Follow me.

MAN: Keep walking.

29:43.540 --> 29:45.041
Get back here.

29:46.680 --> 29:49.274
I only have six left.
Here.

29:49.380 --> 29:50.540
-Take the one with four.
-What is this?

29:50.650 --> 29:52.117
I'm gonna draw them out.

29:52.220 --> 29:53.619
As soon as you hear the shots,

29:53.720 --> 29:54.357
-you run and get out.
-No, no, no.

29:54.590 --> 29:55.614
If you're gonna face him
on your own,

29:55.720 --> 29:57.119
you need more than two bullets.

29:57.220 --> 29:59.984
No, this is the best chance
for you to get away.

30:00.900 --> 30:04.529
Take care of each other.
Take care of Tony.

30:11.670 --> 30:13.365
Okay, go that way.
Go. Go, go, go.

DUMAS: What are you drinking?

30:33.460 --> 30:34.722
TERESA: I'm not.

30:34.830 --> 30:36.821
Straight to business.

30:36.930 --> 30:38.898
I like it.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.891
What is it gonna cost to have
my people and cargo returned?

30:43.000 --> 30:45.901
This city is full of leeches.
I'm not one of them.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.729
I don't want a dime from you.

30:48.840 --> 30:50.501
That's what the People of Color
Chamber of Commerce

30:50.610 --> 30:51.907
is all about.

30:52.010 --> 30:55.616
Minority business owners
helping one another.

30:55.720 --> 30:58.848
You took a risk making
the phone call.

30:58.950 --> 31:00.383
You want something.

31:00.490 --> 31:07.350
*

31:09.760 --> 31:11.762
I don't sell
my product locally.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.895
It's all shipped out of state.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.639
You want to avoid the attention
of local law enforcement, yeah?

31:16.740 --> 31:18.605
-I get it.
-I'm in the tequila business.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.769
-That's all anyone knows.
-Until now.

31:20.870 --> 31:23.270
*

31:23.380 --> 31:26.577
I know who you are.
And now you know who I am.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.147
-As I told you--
-DUMAS: I know.

31:28.250 --> 31:31.139
I know you don't shit
where you eat.

31:33.290 --> 31:35.713
Thing is, you're not
the only one who needs to eat.

-No, wait.

32:14.530 --> 32:16.521
Oh, that was his last shot.

32:16.630 --> 32:18.928

32:19.030 --> 32:21.362
I'm happy to pay you
for returning what is mine.

32:21.470 --> 32:22.596
And that's all.

32:22.700 --> 32:24.839
Wow, that's disappointing.

32:24.940 --> 32:26.168
You know, I see
you're not really, uh,

32:26.270 --> 32:27.430
capturing the spirit

32:27.540 --> 32:30.338
of our minority
business consortium.

32:32.550 --> 32:35.849
Keep the load
but release the driver to me.

32:35.950 --> 32:38.646
This ain't an
la carte situation.

32:40.390 --> 32:43.109
The driver is part
of the package.

32:43.220 --> 32:45.654
(tense music)

32:45.760 --> 32:49.218
You know who he is,
don't you?

32:49.330 --> 32:51.127
Yeah.

32:51.230 --> 32:53.790
Then you know it's not just me
you're gonna have to answer to.

32:53.900 --> 32:56.698
*

32:56.800 --> 32:59.462
When he turns up
as alligator shit...

33:01.910 --> 33:04.140
I'm guessing
you'll answer first.

No, no, no, no.
Come on.

Go, go.

(breathing heavily)

34:29.330 --> 34:31.469
If you gotta kill someone,
you kill me.

34:31.570 --> 34:32.662
She's a civilian.

34:32.770 --> 34:34.328
She's got nothing
to do with this.

34:42.410 --> 34:43.729
But I'm a man of my word.

34:44.680 --> 34:46.272
If it's any consolation,
I'll kill you first

34:46.380 --> 34:47.347
so you don't watch her die.

Who's this?

35:18.280 --> 35:20.475
I have your nephew.

35:20.580 --> 35:22.275
Tio?

35:22.380 --> 35:23.472
You okay?

35:23.580 --> 35:25.844
He's alive.
What about my people?

35:26.890 --> 35:28.118
They're fine.

If something happens to them,

35:32.660 --> 35:34.548
you'll never see your nephew
again.

35:57.850 --> 36:00.341
Yeah, but not without
losing something.

36:01.590 --> 36:03.649
We're selling to Dumas now.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.229
That was his ransom.

36:09.560 --> 36:11.824
(truck door closes)

36:11.930 --> 36:13.921
You have your shipment
and nephew back.

36:14.030 --> 36:14.997
Now we can get
back to business.

36:15.100 --> 36:16.431
Of course.

36:16.540 --> 36:18.269
You mentioned a discount
on the next two shipments.

36:18.370 --> 36:20.907
That was before you kidnapped
and threatened my people.

36:21.010 --> 36:23.433
I won't apologize
for my tactics.

36:23.540 --> 36:25.940
Familia is the _most
important thing.

36:26.050 --> 36:27.369
EL GORDO: I'm sure you
understand that.

36:27.480 --> 36:28.777
I do.

36:28.880 --> 36:31.610
And I would do anything
to protect mine.

36:31.720 --> 36:33.187
Good.

36:33.290 --> 36:34.757
I'll be in touch.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.087
Hey, and you should lighten up,
you know?

36:39.190 --> 36:41.021
We're gonna make
a lot of money together...

36:43.030 --> 36:48.093

36:48.200 --> 36:49.132
Where is he?

KELLY ANNE: What'd he say?

36:58.510 --> 36:59.772
It was Cortez.

36:59.880 --> 37:01.814
He paid them
before he got killed.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.411
If he's dead,
why'd they come after you?

37:04.520 --> 37:05.817
He got paid.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.649
POTE: He's like a bullet
leaving the chamber.

37:07.750 --> 37:09.149
You can never take it back.

37:09.260 --> 37:10.613
TONY: What are we waiting for?
Let's go.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.381
Couldn't find
the second shooter.

37:12.490 --> 37:15.152
-You injured him so maybe, uh--
-He's dead.

37:15.260 --> 37:16.329
He's dead.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.462
Let's hope so.

How you holding up, girl?

38:10.050 --> 38:12.712
I dunno.
Still a little wired.

38:12.820 --> 38:14.356
BIRDIE: Need to cool out.

38:14.460 --> 38:17.020
Thought you might want
to join me.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.054
Lady after my own heart.

38:19.160 --> 38:22.197
* Is going up in flames

38:22.300 --> 38:25.463
* And nobody

38:25.570 --> 38:28.027
* Wanna take the blame

38:28.130 --> 38:29.529
* Don't tell me

38:29.640 --> 38:32.859
Oh.
You did good today.

38:32.970 --> 38:34.699
GEORGE: Held your water.

38:34.810 --> 38:37.131
Ain't no easy thing, staring
down the barrel of a gun.

38:37.240 --> 38:38.798
*

38:38.910 --> 38:42.744
Yeah, well, my father ran
numbers in the French Quarter.

38:42.850 --> 38:44.909
BIRDIE: He used to use me
as a runner.

38:45.020 --> 38:48.046
So I think the first time
someone put a gun in my face,

38:48.150 --> 38:51.085
um, I couldn't have been
more than nine.

38:51.190 --> 38:52.987
Ooh.

38:53.090 --> 38:54.079
Jesus.

38:54.190 --> 38:56.920
So this is not the first time.

38:57.030 --> 39:00.363
But, um, it is the first time
that someone's offered

39:00.470 --> 39:02.836
to take a bullet for me.

39:02.940 --> 39:04.601
Just how my mama raised me.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.530
Don't do that.

39:06.640 --> 39:08.267
What?

39:08.380 --> 39:10.575
BIRDIE: You don't have to be on
all the time.

39:10.680 --> 39:12.671
I mean, not with me.

39:13.850 --> 39:15.909
My coping mechanism.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.544
Hmm.

39:17.650 --> 39:19.345
*

39:19.450 --> 39:21.714
Okay.

39:21.820 --> 39:23.412
I think I got a better one.

39:23.520 --> 39:25.852
* You,
you know *

39:25.960 --> 39:28.349
* Oh, you,
oh, no *

39:28.460 --> 39:30.553
*Me

39:30.660 --> 39:34.391
* Oh, me

39:34.500 --> 39:36.866
* Ooh

39:36.970 --> 39:40.633
* Uh-huh, uh-huh,
oh, baby *

39:40.740 --> 39:42.901
*

39:49.880 --> 39:53.486
Teresa doesn't know I'm alive,
obviously, right?

39:53.590 --> 39:55.558
Not yet.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.755
You think she's still
gonna want me dead?

40:01.860 --> 40:03.748
I don't know.

40:07.130 --> 40:09.928
If she does,
she's gonna ask you to do it.

40:14.170 --> 40:16.434
I won't hold it against you.

40:18.110 --> 40:20.146
Now, honestly, I'd rather you
than anyone else

40:20.250 --> 40:22.070
'cause I know
you'll make it quick.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.456
Tony's safe.
That's all that matters.

40:45.540 --> 40:47.030
(tires squealing)

40:50.780 --> 40:52.338
Get out.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.542
What?

40:53.650 --> 40:56.016
Disappear again.

40:56.120 --> 40:59.009
No one will come after you.
I'll make sure of that.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.384
I'm not gonna cause you
any more problems.

41:01.490 --> 41:03.617
I'm a big boy.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.551
I can take care of myself.

41:11.670 --> 41:13.991
I'm tired of running.

41:14.100 --> 41:16.637
If Teresa still wants me dead,

41:16.740 --> 41:21.234
like, if that'll make her
feel whole, then so be it.

41:21.340 --> 41:24.070
(somber music)

41:24.180 --> 41:26.398
I'm at peace with it.

41:26.510 --> 41:33.382
*

41:40.430 --> 41:43.354
(thunder rumbling)

41:43.460 --> 41:46.361
(suspenseful music)

41:46.470 --> 41:48.938
*

41:53.440 --> 41:56.375
(dramatic music)

41:56.480 --> 42:03.340
*

42:06.920 --> 42:07.887
(film reel clicking)

42:07.990 --> 42:10.879
(keys clacking, bell dings)

42:10.990 --> 42:12.423
