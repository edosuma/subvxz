Humor is the best form of revenge.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.560
No, not so the saying goes.

15:39.689 --> 15:40.896
Now.

15:41.524 --> 15:42.856
I was in your car.

15:44.527 --> 15:45.813
Have great hingekriegt.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.603
Stirs no longer from the spot.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.525
Not until the tow truck is here.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.944
And how do we do that without a telephone?

15:52.076 --> 15:55.410
Um, I have to anyway in the main house.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.279
We can call from there.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.656
Are you hungry?
- A little bit already.

16:00.168 --> 16:01.625
Let's see what I've got.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.204
I have bacon. Den or nothing.

16:05.339 --> 16:08.423
Bacon, yes. I am quite clear for the bacon.
- Good.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.803
What do you do for a living?

16:12.972 --> 16:15.214
Let's call it re-orientation.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.557
Ah, fits to what
happened yesterday.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.596
Oh yeah. That.

16:19.729 --> 16:23.018
How are you now? With the thing.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.896
I just can not feel anything.

16:27.028 --> 16:31.614
I was once almost engaged. I can
imagine how you are doing.

16:32.700 --> 16:33.816
What happened?

16:36.537 --> 16:38.779
It was not,
what they seemed.

16:54.805 --> 16:57.923
Oh, Benjamin, I see a yes that you

16:58.059 --> 17:00.676
you for your top-secret
Project in which you work,

17:00.811 --> 17:02.518
foreclose from the outside world have.
- I have to.

17:02.647 --> 17:06.140
I just hope that the phone
has now been repaired.

17:06.275 --> 17:07.891
Phones are a distraction.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.441
Phones facilitate
Communication over long distances

17:11.571 --> 17:13.438
considerably for older men,

17:13.574 --> 17:16.532
trudging through the snow
need to make a fully ...

17:17.662 --> 17:20.996
... To deliver simple message.

17:21.499 --> 17:24.708
Sorry, Peters. The
Loneliness was helpful.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.828
Wonderful. Your Mother
would like to know, when did they

17:27.964 --> 17:30.001
and your brother brunch beehrst.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.757
Is Jared here?
- He's on the way.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.593
I'm in an hour above.
- Fantastic.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.973
Oh, uh, there's a razor
in the bathroom commode.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.555
Thank Peters.

18:03.541 --> 18:07.034
Apparently "Only Ben"
not the caretaker.

18:08.129 --> 18:11.668
The caretaker is
Peters, who was level with me.

18:13.384 --> 18:16.252
Sometimes I live in his hut.

18:16.971 --> 18:20.260
Although actually
anyway my family belongs.

18:20.391 --> 18:24.476
So you are actually ...

18:25.354 --> 18:26.970
Ben Tannehill.

18:30.985 --> 18:34.228
Excuse me, that I
You've duped.

18:35.281 --> 18:40.447
It was nice for a
While "Only Ben" to be.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.752
So much for bacon.

18:52.340 --> 18:53.672
Is okay. Do not worry.

18:54.717 --> 18:57.334
You know what? Coming
You to the house with me.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.466
Eat only once and then
call the towing service.

19:14.612 --> 19:15.978
Mom?

19:17.323 --> 19:18.484
Peters?

19:20.826 --> 19:22.192
Hello?

19:25.039 --> 19:26.871
Well, wait here. I search.
- Okay.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.456
Okay.

19:42.056 --> 19:43.592
Where are you?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.323
Excuse me, miss?

20:07.790 --> 20:08.826
Can I help you?

20:09.625 --> 20:10.957
You are Maggie Tannehill.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.538
Yes.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.169
Do you have something delivered?

20:15.548 --> 20:17.665
What delivered?
- A package for me?

20:17.800 --> 20:20.292
Peters receives the packets.
- Oh, no, I ...

20:20.678 --> 20:23.796
Precisely. Peters, I've just ...

20:23.973 --> 20:26.215
Has Peters here simply
leave? How strange.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.216
Mom!
- Ben!

20:29.061 --> 20:32.179
But that was also the time that you
get out come back out of your hole.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.931
You are shaved! You Can not See
more like a protester.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.980
Hello Brudy! Come, let's hug you.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.523
Mom, you let him much
go through too much.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.238
Of course. Let it go the way:

20:42.366 --> 20:45.200
Your brother and his mysterious
Guest are every minute here.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.363
Mysterious guest?

20:46.495 --> 20:48.862
Yes. Jared has this morning
called and said,

20:49.373 --> 20:52.582
He has someone there and
we will be surprised.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.833
Jared and his guest
have just arrived.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.206
Is she blond or blond?

20:59.967 --> 21:01.833
Benjamin, hi. I think you ...

21:02.595 --> 21:04.632
The holidays can
now finally start.

21:05.473 --> 21:06.463
Boy!

21:07.266 --> 21:09.599
Merry Christmas!
- Nice to see you again.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.684
You look great!

21:12.313 --> 21:14.771
Oh, Peter, how are you,
Sir? Nice to see you.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.108
All right?
- Yes. Ben.

21:19.236 --> 21:23.697
Listen, I've been trying you
call. I had to talk to you, but

21:23.824 --> 21:25.235
your mobile phone was switched off.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.108
What was there?

21:30.873 --> 21:32.114
Hi Ben.

21:33.751 --> 21:37.415
Claire! What a surprise,
see you again here.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.208
As always a pleasure, Maggie.

21:40.841 --> 21:44.676
Yeah, well, we, we are
run übern way to Halloween.

21:44.804 --> 21:45.965
Halloween?

21:46.806 --> 21:50.015
Uh, yeah. And uh, I
was in New York and uh ...

21:50.142 --> 21:53.226
Jared just wants
say that we are together.

21:53.354 --> 21:57.689
And for understandable
Reasons we wanted to wait

21:57.817 --> 22:02.403
how it develops before we
so go public.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.023
But I think we know now.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.861
Ben, listen, I uh ...

22:14.667 --> 22:16.158
Who are you?

22:16.293 --> 22:20.037
Oh, yeah, um, who are you?
You have not told.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.756
Greta Kannnnabelsteinsky.

22:24.635 --> 22:27.048
And I am...
- My Date this weekend.

22:36.689 --> 22:37.600
What?

22:38.482 --> 22:40.348
That came spontaneously.
But I'm not spontaneous.

22:40.484 --> 22:41.975
I am the opposite of spontaneous.

22:42.111 --> 22:45.229
Her brother brings your ex girlfriend to
Christmas with without what to say beforehand?

22:45.364 --> 22:48.027
I'm sorry, I'll explain that,
why you can not stay.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.615
Hold! No!

22:50.160 --> 22:51.025
No!

22:51.161 --> 22:53.369
We do not leave the
so easily get away.

22:53.497 --> 22:54.908
We?
- We!

22:55.040 --> 22:57.999
You have saved my life. Now
I'll help you to save face.

22:58.127 --> 23:00.494
That we can not do. Also
You have but a fiancé.

23:00.629 --> 23:01.961
Ex-fiance.

23:02.548 --> 23:03.959
I can not talk about it.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.800
But I can with someone
talking, sitting in the same boat.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.630
So far I would not go.

23:08.762 --> 23:11.505
Okay. We are very freshly.
We need to clarify the key data.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.676
Key data?
- Key data.

23:12.808 --> 23:16.222
I am an only child, an orphan, my
Parents died when I was four.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.936
My grandmother raised me. They
died some years ago,

23:19.064 --> 23:20.054
but she still has my
Stanford's degree experienced.

23:21.150 --> 23:22.686
Also, I am Aries.
- I do not know how Aries are.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.150
I was born on April 6.

23:24.278 --> 23:25.519
When she?
- On January 6.

23:25.654 --> 23:26.565
Capricorn?
- Yes.

23:26.697 --> 23:28.279
What is your favorite food?
- Italian.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.023
Everybody likes Italian.

23:30.159 --> 23:32.776

- Chicken Tikka Massala, what? Yes!

23:33.829 --> 23:35.320
Okay, uh, where have
we get to know?

23:35.539 --> 23:36.370
Beverly Hills.

23:36.498 --> 23:38.706
My car had ne Panne
and I happened to be passing.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.666
That was really nice of you.
- Thank you.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.456
Allergies?
- No. They?

23:42.588 --> 23:44.045
Only younger brothers.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.005
Where were you at the university?
- Harvard.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.920
Yes of course. Sport?
- Captain.

23:48.052 --> 23:50.294
Unbelievable!
- In Oxford I played rugby.

23:50.429 --> 23:53.217
Hab ne scar where Niles
Jacoby Howe caught me in the scrum.

23:53.349 --> 23:56.092
No idea what that means, but
I hope it has been disinfected.

23:56.310 --> 23:58.222
Just one thing!
- What?

24:00.564 --> 24:03.227
Christmas is, we end up
eventually under the mistletoe,

24:03.359 --> 24:06.022
and when our first kiss
would have been, that would be suspect.

24:06.654 --> 24:07.644
All right.

24:11.825 --> 24:15.193
Only once by the way: I can do much better
kiss, if you do not falls upon me.

24:15.829 --> 24:17.695
My car is no longer drove.

24:17.831 --> 24:19.697
In Beverly Hills.
- In Beverly Hills.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.284
And I had my phone
forget I Obertrottel.

24:22.419 --> 24:25.958
And who came by me
saved? Captain Sonny Boy!

24:26.674 --> 24:29.667
That's my nickname for him
because of his time at Harvard.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.759
And we are talking about times rather
not from his Oxford Scrum.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.503
Rugby.
- Rugby.

24:34.431 --> 24:38.050
Oh, before I forget it: Peters
asked where he can pick up your stuff.

24:38.185 --> 24:39.721
My stuff?
- Your luggage.

24:39.853 --> 24:42.345
Not that your current wardrobe
not charming works, but

24:42.481 --> 24:45.690
You want the surely
not kept on over the holidays.

24:45.818 --> 24:50.734
Quite right. My luggage is
unfortunately not here.

24:51.991 --> 24:52.606
Where is it?

24:52.741 --> 24:54.858
At home. In Los Angeles.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.486
In my closet. I have nothing here.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.283
Nothing at all?
- No.

24:59.415 --> 25:02.453
You know, Ben took me
completely surprised.

25:02.584 --> 25:03.574
You could say he
just made me packed

25:05.254 --> 25:07.291
and taken away and here I am.
- Ben?

25:07.423 --> 25:10.416
Ben! He is so romantic and spontaneous.

25:10.551 --> 25:13.043
This Ben?
- Yes, this Ben.

25:13.721 --> 25:16.885
I may not always so
been spontaneous and romantic, but

25:17.016 --> 25:20.680
There is something about Greta,
the this site makes me.

25:21.770 --> 25:25.263
Oh, Spatzi. You say truly
the allertollsten things.

25:26.233 --> 25:29.977
How: do not need to pack, come
just so that we are together.

25:31.155 --> 25:32.817
Well, then I've done.

25:32.990 --> 25:35.903
I drive afterwards in the city to
to get a few things for tomorrow.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.527
Maybe you want me yes
accompany and buy the bare necessities.

25:38.662 --> 25:39.652
Oh, that would be great, thanks.

25:41.623 --> 25:44.832
I also have a few things
I would get. I am closing in.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.717
Over there is a nice store,
where do you get baking ingredients.

25:54.845 --> 25:57.337
If your ambitions
you in the direction.

25:57.473 --> 26:00.090
As you know, Maggie, I'm in Paris

26:00.225 --> 26:03.184
one summer at
Cordon Bleu College studied.

26:04.521 --> 26:05.807
I did not.

26:05.981 --> 26:08.815
But my grandma and I have to
Christmas always baked gingerbread.

26:08.984 --> 26:11.852
Gingerbread would be just what we
children can make you happy.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.228
Children?

26:13.447 --> 26:14.312
Each Christmas

26:14.448 --> 26:17.486
sell fir Hills Sweet
Biscuits in the Charity Bazaar.

26:17.701 --> 26:18.612
You remember?

26:18.744 --> 26:22.283
I associate only good feelings
with my time in your family.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.326
The impression I also. Okay, ladies.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.700
Worried you what you need,
for baking or for whatever,

26:26.835 --> 26:29.043
and we meet
back in an hour.

26:39.723 --> 26:42.682
Excuse me, how much does it cost?

26:43.435 --> 26:45.722
The Gingerbread House? $ 50.

26:46.688 --> 26:50.272
Good. I'll give you a hundred dollars,

26:50.400 --> 26:52.562
the rest is for delivery
and other expenses,

26:52.694 --> 26:55.357
you deliver to please
Tannehill estate. At 16 o'clock.

26:55.489 --> 26:59.608
Call me previously at this position
, and I come out and taking it on.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.154
That part is really important:

27:01.286 --> 27:04.279
No one may look at except me.

27:04.414 --> 27:07.031
But Miss, that's the exhibit.
It takes one and a half days ...

27:07.167 --> 27:09.659
I can not but
wait one and a half days.

27:09.795 --> 27:12.287
Listen...
- No, you simply provide the da.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.252
Listen...

27:17.678 --> 27:19.510
Bring the past.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.255
All right. I bring you this.

27:22.391 --> 27:24.929
No no no. Still
none is engaged, but

27:25.060 --> 27:28.098
I know who it is likely
becomes. , You're gonna Story,

27:28.230 --> 27:29.596
which is unbelievable.
- Good Good!

27:29.731 --> 27:31.973
Well then, do something
Draus, Greta. With Photos!

27:32.234 --> 27:33.691
That I will. I wanted to tell you:

27:33.819 --> 27:35.776
After transport would
I have the corner office.

27:35.904 --> 27:38.692
Do not get cocky. Still
you have not the story.

27:39.199 --> 27:40.440
Wes has his sources.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.568
What kind of resources? Of the...

27:55.465 --> 27:57.206
What are you doing here?

27:58.385 --> 28:00.297
I'll get the Christmas decorations out.

28:00.971 --> 28:02.963
Since when do you do that?

28:04.766 --> 28:07.975
This is the first Christmas that Mom
wants to celebrate, since Dad died.

28:09.062 --> 28:11.600
You're not the only one,
the family meaning.

28:13.984 --> 28:15.976
Are you now the whole
Week mad at me?

28:16.361 --> 28:18.694
Well, who hath the
fired the first shot?

28:19.031 --> 28:22.195
The with Claire but is not
Game. She is my girlfriend.

28:22.326 --> 28:24.818
And my ex, Jared.
- That's more than a year ago.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.862
Did you not yet over?
Is that Greta only to distraction?

28:27.998 --> 28:30.331
It's not about here
Greta and you know that.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.246
It's about respect.

28:33.670 --> 28:36.003
With Claire I was almost engaged.

28:36.757 --> 28:39.044
And to drag here
without us warn,

28:39.176 --> 28:41.543
that's really disrespectful,
opposite me and Mom.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.419
This is the small family-multiplication tables.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.298
And even someone who is so selfish
as you, the would have to actually buckle.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.470
Oh, the number again, yes?

28:48.602 --> 28:51.015
Is that Ben is back, the
Holy and Jared, the Selfish?

28:51.146 --> 28:53.729
Just stop being selfish,
then they call you no longer like that.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.525
Hey boys! Listens to!

29:04.368 --> 29:05.904
How old are you?
- 34th

29:06.036 --> 29:08.073
And you? How old?
- Much younger.

29:08.205 --> 29:11.664
In any case, old enough to not more
falling into such childish patterns.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.412
We have Christmas.

29:13.543 --> 29:16.377
You two know yet exactly,
what it means to me this hard.

29:16.505 --> 29:17.666
After what has happened.

29:17.798 --> 29:19.255
I'm sorry, Mom.
- Me too.

29:19.383 --> 29:21.124
This is not a competition.
- I'm just, I'm sorry.

29:21.260 --> 29:25.254
Stop at last! Okay, all
both. Rauf in your room.

29:27.683 --> 29:30.300
Has now really your
Mother sent to your room?

29:30.602 --> 29:32.138
Sexy, eh?

29:34.690 --> 29:38.024
Am sure that Claire
you still find sexy.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.397
Claire?
- Jap.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.737
When I with you and your
Mother was traveling,

29:42.864 --> 29:44.776
it has behaved,
like I'm competing.

29:44.908 --> 29:47.116
But not in competition
Contest of the daughters.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.110
She still likes you.

29:49.871 --> 29:51.988
They like the idea,
to be a Tannehill.

29:52.416 --> 29:53.327
I do not know.

29:53.458 --> 29:57.543
She has a while she stares
at you as if you were Santa Claus.

29:57.671 --> 30:01.711
Greta! I have your purchases
found in the living room.

30:01.842 --> 30:03.674
The You could have
do not have to bring up.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.551
Oh, no no no. Absolutely fine.

30:05.679 --> 30:07.261
Should I do something with it?

30:07.889 --> 30:09.471
Bring to my room, yes.

30:09.599 --> 30:12.683
But this is yet
You and Ben's room.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.431
Or?

30:14.563 --> 30:17.021
Of course it is. Thank you, Peter.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.765
Yes, because it's good.

30:22.779 --> 30:24.236
Do you have anything else?

30:24.990 --> 30:26.526
Yes, thank you.
- Good!

30:31.913 --> 30:33.324
I sleep on the floor.
- I'll take the couch.

30:33.457 --> 30:35.164
How so? Take now the bed.
- Then I'll take the floor.

30:35.292 --> 30:36.783
Why the ground? Take the bed!

30:36.960 --> 30:38.952
Fine, I'll take the bed.
- I'll take the couch.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.876
You take the flour, which sprinkle on
Brett and then rollst the dough in it.

30:47.012 --> 30:49.800
The flour on the board.
Then roll out the dough.

30:52.809 --> 30:55.392
But you have not so much flour
sprinkle on the board. - Too much?

30:55.854 --> 30:57.186
Spread now?
- Yes.

30:57.314 --> 31:00.182
Okay.
- Be careful that he is not too thin.

31:00.317 --> 31:03.560
Not too thin. How so,
crumbles at the ends?

31:04.988 --> 31:07.025
Maybe, maybe you need to ...
- I'm really overwhelmed.

31:07.157 --> 31:09.740
Can you please show me?
- Yes okay.

31:10.243 --> 31:13.327
So how does it work?
- Okay, so maybe you can even ...

31:13.455 --> 31:17.074
Yes. From the inside to the outside. Then there is ...
- Outward? Show me.

31:17.459 --> 31:19.667
Yes. evenly everywhere.
Given below also. Do you see?

31:19.795 --> 31:21.252
Yes very good!

31:25.759 --> 31:27.671
Oh, hey, Jared. All right?

31:27.803 --> 31:30.216
This smells so full well
here. What are you doing?

31:30.347 --> 31:33.135
We have a couple of degrees
finished. Want to try?

31:33.600 --> 31:35.262
Yes.
- Here.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.386
Thank Greta.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.398
N / A?
- Tastes good, eh?

31:43.527 --> 31:45.314
Yes!
- And here ...

31:46.196 --> 31:49.405
ne bag icing,
If you want to help us.

31:49.825 --> 31:51.066
Should I really?

31:51.201 --> 31:52.692
I trust you.

31:55.997 --> 31:58.205
Simply press?
- You have to keep it a little flatter.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.949
So?

32:00.794 --> 32:02.126
I'll show you.

32:05.549 --> 32:08.087
You pressing them up together ...

32:08.635 --> 32:10.376
Then you think you nice and flat,

32:11.012 --> 32:14.471
then dosing is totally easy.

32:15.016 --> 32:17.975
Do you see? Try it.

32:18.562 --> 32:20.303
Where did you learn that?

32:20.439 --> 32:22.476
They showed me the degree.

32:22.816 --> 32:24.603
But with you it smells delicious.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.185
The secret ingredients of Grandma's recipe.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.401
What is the secret?

32:28.530 --> 32:31.147
I tell no secrets.
- White pepper and cardamom.

32:32.159 --> 32:34.526
That's what happens when you let me help.
- No!

32:40.459 --> 32:43.418
Biscuits! I find so sweet.

32:43.545 --> 32:47.209
As you can see, I am the
Master on the sugar bag.

32:47.340 --> 32:49.957
If you want, I'll help
you with your gingerbread house.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.509
Gingerbread house?

32:51.636 --> 32:53.343
Do not you have time for it?

32:53.472 --> 32:56.886
I planned out everything. If
it all lies in bed afterwards nice

32:57.017 --> 32:58.679
and I me me
may focus,

32:58.810 --> 33:02.804
then I'll build you a gingerbread house,
of which you will be thrilled.

33:03.273 --> 33:04.684
The kids will surely love it.

33:04.816 --> 33:05.932
Where are we going tomorrow?

33:06.067 --> 33:09.026
We make a Charity Bazaar
for children from poor households.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.646
This is a tradition in the pine Hills.

33:11.907 --> 33:15.071
Being in politics is also a
Tannehill tradition. Is it true, Ben?

33:16.828 --> 33:20.572
Ben has told you about his plans,
to be the next Tannehill Governor?

33:20.874 --> 33:23.161
Not if Jared is faster.

33:24.085 --> 33:26.168
Why is that funny?

33:26.963 --> 33:29.580
Well, you're a stockbroker.

33:32.052 --> 33:33.338
And?

33:34.721 --> 33:38.055
Because stockbrokers are not politicians.

33:39.434 --> 33:40.970
Should they perhaps.

33:41.102 --> 33:43.560
To follow his heart,
is the most important.

34:26.022 --> 34:27.353
What are you doing there?

34:28.525 --> 34:31.108
I'm sorry. It lay there ...

34:31.610 --> 34:33.351
Because you thought you read the times?

34:33.487 --> 34:35.696
That's really good.
- But that's private.

34:38.326 --> 34:40.534
You like it?
- I've read a few lines, but

34:40.661 --> 34:42.904
you notice immediately that it is good.

34:43.039 --> 34:45.156
Ben, you're talented genuine.

34:45.583 --> 34:46.791
Thank you.

34:49.212 --> 34:50.748
Ne love story.

34:50.880 --> 34:54.623
I would have thought a politician writes
rather what Historical or Political.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.295
I am not a politician.

34:56.428 --> 35:01.014
Well, I thought you
Career doing. Just like your father.

35:01.141 --> 35:02.848
Yes, that is expected of me.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.392
But you do not want.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.512
The fir Hills are
no writer.

35:07.647 --> 35:10.355
The judges are or senators or ...
- Stockbrokers?

35:10.900 --> 35:13.984
Jared may be a stockbroker. Not me.

35:14.362 --> 35:16.399
The burden of the firstborn.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.482
Sound ridiculous to you.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.235
Not really ridiculous.
Rather overwhelming.

35:23.204 --> 35:24.740
Is still your life, Ben.

35:24.873 --> 35:26.865
Not your father. If you are a
Want to be a writer,

35:27.000 --> 35:29.242
then you should be a writer.
- Easy to say,

35:29.377 --> 35:31.460
if you of anyone
Accountable must.

35:45.185 --> 35:46.426
I'm sorry, I ...

35:46.853 --> 35:49.345
No. No, you're right.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.188
You're the one doing me a favor.

36:00.325 --> 36:01.987
Good night, "Only Ben".

36:03.370 --> 36:05.327
Good Night, Snow Bride.

36:14.422 --> 36:15.754
Here's your house, Miss.

36:15.882 --> 36:18.215
But listen. You need to
really, the house ...

37:03.972 --> 37:05.258
You!
- I!

37:05.390 --> 37:07.677
What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

37:07.809 --> 37:09.300
The same as you.

37:09.436 --> 37:10.722
What have you found out?

37:11.604 --> 37:13.220
I tell you not.

37:13.982 --> 37:16.099
Was that you just with Ben Tannehill?

37:16.234 --> 37:18.100
I tell you not.

37:18.611 --> 37:20.193
What keeps me
from because now go in

37:20.321 --> 37:22.654
and your web of lies
to collapse?

37:23.241 --> 37:25.984
Knowing that your web of lies
then the same with collapse.

37:27.370 --> 37:29.032
Nice.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.787
Ceasefire.

37:31.374 --> 37:32.865
Ceasefire.

37:33.376 --> 37:35.663
Now fuck off.

37:44.220 --> 37:48.089
He jumped into the carriage
and whistled the team,

37:48.224 --> 37:51.137
since they were already flying over the valley on Tann.

37:51.269 --> 37:54.808
But listen to his voice! Out
the distance it sounds softly.

37:54.981 --> 37:59.772
Merry Christmas to all
and all good night.

37:59.903 --> 38:01.860
Over!

38:02.280 --> 38:03.441
Okay.

38:03.573 --> 38:05.485
Who wants to play football?
- Here, let me!

38:05.617 --> 38:06.983
Well, then go!

38:07.619 --> 38:10.327
And off!

38:32.393 --> 38:35.261
You did well. Always
remember: high on the body.

38:35.396 --> 38:36.557
Exactly, good!

38:36.981 --> 38:38.768
Thank you, Mr. Tannehill.
- Tell Ben to me quietly.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.766
I look next week
Let's see how you make yourself, yes?

38:40.902 --> 38:42.643
Thank you.
- Good.

38:44.197 --> 38:45.984
See you.
- Yes!

38:49.327 --> 38:50.909
Ben Tannehill.

38:51.579 --> 38:52.820
Nice guy.

38:53.122 --> 38:54.533
That surprise you?

38:55.124 --> 38:57.787
Since I runtergekullert the hill
am, everything was a surprise.

38:58.586 --> 39:02.830
Yes, you already have with
talked to him? With Al?

39:03.216 --> 39:04.206
No.

39:04.592 --> 39:06.834
You sure you do not by
House need to clarify things?

39:06.970 --> 39:08.381
Jup.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.922
By the way: The sweater suits you.

39:12.058 --> 39:13.139
How did it go?

39:13.268 --> 39:15.851
Fantastic!
More than 2,000 dollars.

39:15.979 --> 39:19.768
Jared has probably at my
Gingerbread house offered something too much.

39:19.899 --> 39:21.106
Oh really?

39:21.776 --> 39:23.233
How was the storytelling?

39:23.736 --> 39:24.897
Ben makes it wonderful.

39:25.029 --> 39:28.147
Ben is a born storyteller.
- Yes, I remember.

39:28.283 --> 39:30.650
Are you writing still
these little short stories?

39:30.785 --> 39:31.741
Short stories?

39:31.870 --> 39:33.702
Yes, as Ben and I were together,

39:33.830 --> 39:37.073
because it has pretty small
Stories written.

39:37.250 --> 39:40.414
And then he said that he
times would be a writer.

39:40.545 --> 39:42.161
Really?
- Claire.

39:43.089 --> 39:45.206
Sorry. I'll get it shortly.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.423
Hey!
- Did the stain out anything?

39:51.097 --> 39:52.133
The patch is out!

39:52.265 --> 39:55.053
Thank-you! Again one less worry.

39:55.184 --> 39:57.972
You can `t imagine,
What is this for a stress.

39:58.104 --> 40:00.437
The caterer has the
Audacity to deliver large shrimp,

40:00.565 --> 40:01.931
instead of jumbo shrimp.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.807
As if to me so what
Would miss the obvious.

40:03.985 --> 40:06.944
I'm sorry, I have to tell you ...
- Uncle Paden flirting with Kevin's mother!

40:07.071 --> 40:09.279
Okay, no, I'll call you back.

40:11.451 --> 40:12.987
I am so dead.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.325
Can I ask you for a
Moment kidnap? Sorry.

40:17.290 --> 40:20.374
So the dress is still in
the cottage for airing. Peters ...

40:20.501 --> 40:22.584
Can not see it.
- Bingo. Well, let's go.

40:22.712 --> 40:24.874
I can not go.
Raffle for the children.

40:25.006 --> 40:27.339
Okay, then I'll go. Key please.

40:28.134 --> 40:30.217
The snow is melting. You
get your car back safe.

40:30.345 --> 40:31.802
Honest!

40:32.680 --> 40:34.137
Good.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.424
R is back, yes?

40:37.769 --> 40:39.726
I have briefly gone, sorry.

41:15.014 --> 41:16.346
No!

41:49.966 --> 41:51.673
What are you searching for here?

41:54.554 --> 41:55.635
I'm sorry.

41:56.055 --> 41:58.672
The I take.
- The really am so sorry.

41:58.808 --> 42:01.551
I did not want to disrespect
be. I just wanted what,

42:01.686 --> 42:03.848
and I forgot it here.
I am really sorry.

42:03.980 --> 42:05.812
A wedding dress perhaps?

42:06.149 --> 42:08.436
You know where it is, yes?

42:08.985 --> 42:10.692
Can you give me maybe
recommend ne cleaning?

42:12.280 --> 42:14.943
Have you and married Ben secretly?
- No!

42:15.074 --> 42:18.784
No no no! We
do not know each other.

42:24.000 --> 42:24.990
They only do so?

42:25.126 --> 42:26.242
It was spontaneous.

42:26.377 --> 42:29.620
Normally it is not spontaneous,
but because Jared and Claire ...

42:30.548 --> 42:32.164
The charade has to stop.

42:32.300 --> 42:34.292
Oh no. No no no.

42:34.427 --> 42:36.794
Also remember Maggie. They
is quite fond of you.

42:36.971 --> 42:38.382
Really?

42:38.514 --> 42:40.801
Yeah, me too of her.

42:41.309 --> 42:43.722
You know, all are much nicer,
as I've imagined.

42:44.979 --> 42:48.814
You said you know nothing about
the family, they are stumbled.

42:50.818 --> 42:53.652
That's right. Yes, just as it was.

42:54.322 --> 42:56.314
Something you conceal me.

42:58.201 --> 43:00.318
The same could I
said about you.

43:00.453 --> 43:02.820
What do you mean?
- The letters.

43:14.884 --> 43:17.797
Maggie and I have known
since our youth.

43:19.138 --> 43:21.050
In the Unizeit we
lost sight of each other.

43:21.599 --> 43:24.967
I have Evan on his first election campaign
helped when his wife walked through the door.

43:26.646 --> 43:28.182
It was Maggie.

43:28.648 --> 43:30.264
You love them.

43:30.858 --> 43:32.065
No.

43:35.363 --> 43:39.403
After death we felt Evans
us another very connected.

43:39.534 --> 43:44.029
But I thought it would be more appropriate
only the managers to stay.

43:46.374 --> 43:48.616
Evan was like a brother.

43:51.879 --> 43:53.586
They tell nothing about it.

43:53.714 --> 43:55.296
Never.

43:56.801 --> 43:59.794
Tell Ben and me
Chance to solve this problem alone.

44:00.972 --> 44:02.804
We will make it.
- Fast!

44:03.975 --> 44:06.137
Quick.
- All right.

44:09.188 --> 44:14.434
All I want, Miss
Kanenablesteinsky is that ...

44:14.569 --> 44:17.437
Keep in mind the consequences,

44:18.364 --> 44:20.230
on feelings show consideration.

44:22.410 --> 44:23.821
Good.

44:30.126 --> 44:32.209
Hey.
- Hey.

44:33.588 --> 44:37.207
I'm sorry about earlier. I
wanted because of your writing

44:37.341 --> 44:40.049
no problems between
your mom and you produce.

44:42.388 --> 44:44.550
Did not you.
- Good.

44:45.516 --> 44:48.429
Really, that's the
last thing I want.

44:51.147 --> 44:53.264
Ben, you have a moment?

44:54.609 --> 44:55.690
Yes.

44:59.405 --> 45:01.146
I do not know how that happened.

45:01.282 --> 45:04.366
He's like a mixture of
Butler Carson and Obi Wan Kenobi.

45:04.493 --> 45:06.109
He questioned me and
I confessed everything.

45:06.245 --> 45:09.204
As in the finale of a
Law-and-order sequence or so.

45:09.332 --> 45:11.415
You told him everything?
- Yes.

45:11.834 --> 45:14.042
Then I have to talk about it with my mom.
- Oh no. Do not you have to.

45:14.170 --> 45:16.787
Peters has promised that
He will not tell her anything.

45:17.506 --> 45:18.872
How did you attempt it?

45:19.050 --> 45:20.291
I have my methods.

45:20.426 --> 45:23.715
But now everything's cool and apologize,
that I can squeeze myself.

45:24.222 --> 45:25.463
Is okay.

45:26.057 --> 45:28.049
When Jared and I had earlier dispute,

45:28.184 --> 45:31.097
Mom Peters has commissioned,
find out the real reason.

45:31.229 --> 45:32.185
Not your dad?

45:34.190 --> 45:37.024
No. He was always at work.

45:38.194 --> 45:40.356
Did he ever your
Read short stories?

45:42.281 --> 45:43.237
No.

45:44.700 --> 45:49.536
I've never shown it.

46:01.884 --> 46:04.171
Are you sure?
- Not at all.

46:05.763 --> 46:07.129
Do not stop you.

46:26.367 --> 46:29.531
Are you enjoying your undercover life
among the rich and famous?

46:29.662 --> 46:32.871
They're not the way I thought
hab. Of course, they are rich,

46:32.999 --> 46:34.331
but they are also nice.

46:34.417 --> 46:35.498
I beg your pardon?

46:35.626 --> 46:36.787
Wait a minute short.

46:40.256 --> 46:41.087
Okay, continue.

46:41.340 --> 46:44.674
Did you just using the word "nice" the
Characterizes object of your investigation?

46:44.802 --> 46:45.883
Yes I have.

46:46.012 --> 46:49.426
And I feel now
even guilty. And nasty.

46:49.557 --> 46:52.265
Do I need a SWAT team
Send to ensure that you get out there?

46:52.393 --> 46:55.682
I am serious. American
Adel, but I find the all super.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.770
So, no wild orgies?

46:57.898 --> 46:59.514
No. Pastries and Football.

46:59.650 --> 47:01.687
And not because of PR,
but for the most deprived.

47:01.819 --> 47:03.651
That we can participate in our
Not use newspaper.

47:03.779 --> 47:05.520
You're right. That's just sweet.

47:05.656 --> 47:07.568
Because somewhere a hook must be.

47:07.700 --> 47:09.316
Usually already.

47:10.453 --> 47:11.569
We listen to.

47:31.640 --> 47:32.847
Hey!
- Hey!

47:32.975 --> 47:35.809
Your car is now
fully fueled and repaired.

47:35.978 --> 47:37.765
Ah, you're great. Thank you.

47:37.897 --> 47:41.140
Or should I prefer you not
Give getaway car while you are reading?

47:42.026 --> 47:43.688
What?

47:43.819 --> 47:44.900
No.

47:45.029 --> 47:47.817
I just want to know whether the two
come together after all these years.

47:49.241 --> 47:50.698
Is this...

47:52.244 --> 47:54.361
too cheesy?

47:55.831 --> 47:58.039
Ben, that's really good.

47:58.626 --> 48:02.791
One does not expect a guy like you
good love stories are written, but ...

48:13.891 --> 48:16.929
Ben, you're really talented.

48:17.061 --> 48:18.802
And it would be a shame,
if you throw away the,

48:18.979 --> 48:20.720
just about any
To meet expectations.

48:46.424 --> 48:48.290
Had I the
Christmas Ball mentioned?

48:48.426 --> 48:50.964
Christmas ... No, you did not.

48:51.095 --> 48:52.336
There is a Christmas ball.

48:52.471 --> 48:53.712
When?
- Today.

48:53.848 --> 48:56.261
What?
- It's really not a big deal.

48:56.392 --> 48:58.850
It's Moms Charity Ball.

48:58.978 --> 49:00.765
I think that's a mega big deal!

49:02.064 --> 49:03.680
Yes, you are right.

49:04.358 --> 49:05.894
But I did nothing to put on.

49:06.026 --> 49:07.142
Precisely.

49:07.278 --> 49:10.737
This is perhaps
somewhat presumptuous, but ...

49:11.323 --> 49:14.987
when I was just now in the city, have
I a little bit shopped for you.

49:15.744 --> 49:19.328
Nothing special. Only a few clothes.

49:19.457 --> 49:21.949
Available in various sizes.

49:22.751 --> 49:24.492
And shoes.

49:25.045 --> 49:27.628
Also available in different sizes.

49:28.799 --> 49:29.539
Ben.

49:29.675 --> 49:33.009
What you do not like, can
you bring back, that's okay.

49:35.514 --> 49:39.133
That's the least I can do,
after what you've done for me.

49:42.188 --> 49:44.726
You are the one that is here great, Greta.

50:19.642 --> 50:20.428
Thank you.

50:34.240 --> 50:36.277
You look gorgeous!

50:36.408 --> 50:37.865
Thank you.

50:39.119 --> 50:40.360
Ben, we go!

50:41.080 --> 50:43.242
Sorry. Ll be right there.

50:58.597 --> 51:01.635
You look amazing.

51:02.434 --> 51:04.266
You too.

51:05.771 --> 51:07.558
May I?

51:15.030 --> 51:16.146
Thank-you.

51:48.689 --> 51:49.850
Let's drink something.

51:54.820 --> 51:56.061
I'll be right back.

52:08.542 --> 52:11.535
Her dress is really stunning.

52:11.670 --> 52:14.083
But you must also
not just hide. - Thank you.

52:14.214 --> 52:15.955
Here's someone breathtaking.

52:18.260 --> 52:20.001
Why do not you ask them?

52:20.137 --> 52:22.379
No no no.
- Do you think she does not want to dance?

52:22.514 --> 52:25.177
I can not...
- With her friend from his youth?

52:29.855 --> 52:32.313
Well, when you put it like this, then ...

52:32.441 --> 52:34.899
no longer it sounds
so terrifying.

52:37.863 --> 52:39.229
Is my tie?

52:39.365 --> 52:41.106
Nothing to complain about.

52:54.129 --> 52:55.791
They have a Christmas school?

52:55.964 --> 52:58.547
Yes indeed. Between
Roxburgh and Wooden Elms.

52:58.967 --> 53:01.801
Wooden Elms. Really interesting.

53:02.388 --> 53:04.004
I have to go.

53:10.646 --> 53:12.638
You!
- Yes I!

53:12.773 --> 53:14.264
Stalkst you about me?

53:17.861 --> 53:19.602
No, I Stalke my story.

53:19.738 --> 53:21.570
Which story? No one is engaged.

53:22.449 --> 53:26.944
Jared Tannehill drags his ex
Brother as his new girlfriend to?

53:27.079 --> 53:30.038
Come on. That's a story.
- Yes, an old.

53:30.165 --> 53:31.451
Inform you, Wes.

53:33.252 --> 53:34.788
This is not your color.

53:41.969 --> 53:43.551
Everything okay with you?

53:44.221 --> 53:47.714
But already! I believe,
I've lost something.

53:48.434 --> 53:50.300
But how do you do that?
- Very good. Thanks for asking.

53:50.436 --> 53:54.851
Nice. Who is the man with
the lady has spoken degrees?

53:54.982 --> 53:57.725
Oh, the little man with the
Mustache? A reporter.

53:57.860 --> 54:00.477
I think he is
Reporter. From "Gossip Pulse".

54:00.612 --> 54:03.025
He sneaks around here and asking questions.

54:04.700 --> 54:06.032
Thank you.

54:23.677 --> 54:25.464
Hey! Greta.

54:25.804 --> 54:29.047
Who is the man with whom you grade yourself
hast entertained? Apparently, you know each other.

54:29.558 --> 54:31.390
A guy who after
Men's room has been looking for.

54:34.146 --> 54:38.481
You may think, just because you Ben
did you ever sit in the front row.

54:38.609 --> 54:40.976
But that's just your
temporary space.

54:41.653 --> 54:43.269
You have to know.

54:43.864 --> 54:44.695
Excuse me.

55:10.390 --> 55:12.052
Now just relax some games.

55:12.184 --> 55:14.392
Yes.
- Very loose. I do not bite already.

55:14.520 --> 55:16.011
Now already say what you
ask me wanted.

55:18.398 --> 55:24.440
What exactly do you know about Greta
Kanee as always, also called.

55:26.240 --> 55:27.822
What makes you think that?

55:28.700 --> 55:30.157
Only from curiosity.

55:32.621 --> 55:34.237
That does not concern you, Claire.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.491
I do think that
what that concerns me.

55:40.712 --> 55:42.874
Your family is important to me, Ben.

55:43.715 --> 55:45.377
I've missed you.

55:46.301 --> 55:49.169
And I did not know how much,
until I had seen you again.

55:54.059 --> 55:55.300
Sorry.

56:02.734 --> 56:04.225
Can I borrow my girlfriend?

56:05.654 --> 56:06.644
Sure, of course.

56:22.588 --> 56:23.624
Maestro!

56:29.761 --> 56:31.047
Claire.

56:32.306 --> 56:34.798
You're the most amazing woman,
I've ever met.

56:35.392 --> 56:38.226
You're beautiful, and you're smart.

56:39.313 --> 56:43.432
You're the woman all night
a gingerbread house for children bakes.

56:46.528 --> 56:52.399
And I know that maybe for
some may come somewhat surprising.

56:53.327 --> 56:54.909
But not for me.

56:59.833 --> 57:02.291
Claire Palmer Sinclaire.

57:03.170 --> 57:06.789
Would you honor me the
prove to be my wife?

57:12.054 --> 57:13.010
Yes.

57:47.089 --> 57:48.705
Everything okay?

57:57.140 --> 57:58.847
Dance with me.

58:10.070 --> 58:11.902
It still hurts, right?

58:18.161 --> 58:19.447
Not really.

58:25.085 --> 58:26.792
Why did you separate then?

58:30.340 --> 58:33.549
After we had come together, stand
my name suddenly in the tabloids

58:33.677 --> 58:35.885
like never before.

58:36.013 --> 58:39.222
Also no more after separation.

58:39.349 --> 58:41.591
Then my father died and ...

58:42.686 --> 58:45.895
the paparazzi rushed as the
Geier published on us and

58:46.023 --> 58:48.982
every private detail.

58:50.444 --> 58:52.731
I knew it.

58:54.489 --> 58:56.822
She just used me.

58:58.118 --> 59:01.782
She has used the family,
order to celebrate as a celebrity.

59:02.998 --> 59:05.285
Bad if you do not
know who you can trust.

59:10.130 --> 59:13.294
Crazy, I trust you.

59:14.551 --> 59:17.134
Ben ... - I know, I know
you do not ...

59:19.556 --> 59:21.593
But why should I not be trusted,

59:21.725 --> 59:25.218
so if you do something crazy,
to help someone else.

59:30.358 --> 59:31.394
What?

59:32.986 --> 59:34.602
You said it yourself.

59:35.447 --> 59:38.565
At Christmas we land
eventually under the mistletoe.

59:41.828 --> 59:43.194
Ben!

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:04.132
I'm sorry...

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:07.135
Greta!

01:01:02.284 --> 01:01:03.570
Hey.

01:01:04.035 --> 01:01:04.946
Hello There.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:07.445
Can I?
- Sure, sit down.

01:01:08.623 --> 01:01:11.081
Is it warm enough?
- Yes, I think so.

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:16.371
Did you enjoy the evening?
- Yes very. And them?

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:19.381
On the whole, so, yes.

01:01:20.218 --> 01:01:24.053
It was nice to finally
to laugh and dance.

01:01:24.723 --> 01:01:27.090
It's Ben particularly important
that you can enjoy Christmas.

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:29.512
You is very much about him, yes?

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:34.643
He is a wonderful person.

01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:37.145
He is not so,
as I've expected.

01:01:37.277 --> 01:01:39.143
Why expect?

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:40.520
Well, when I met him.

01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:43.614
I mean, now I expect
Of course just wonderful.

01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:48.240
And that Claire is here?
Come cope with it?

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:52.949
Would I have to say,
but it is unusual.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.496
This is still expressed softly.

01:01:57.422 --> 01:02:00.210
Both sons are the same
Been wife.

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:02.629
And one engaged for today.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:05.173
This is again a feast for the press.

01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:10.640
Perhaps will not be as bad.

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:13.682
Not in this day and age with the
Kardashians and the rest of them.

01:02:13.813 --> 01:02:16.681
But in contrast to those want
we no publicity.

01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:19.149
This makes us all the more to the target.

01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:20.688
It can be.

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:22.732
But maybe you're right.

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:27.575
Probably what you need yet
Deftigeres to attract attention.

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:33.239
Like the fact that Claire earlier
has times angebaggert my husband.

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:34.661
What? Not seriously!

01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:35.954
Oh but.

01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:40.171
Well, that was years before
she and Ben were a pair.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:41.830
How did you find out?

01:02:41.967 --> 01:02:43.048
I've seen them.

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:47.887
And saw how Evan
dismissed and brought to the door.

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:50.597
Goodbye forever
I've thought back then.

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:53.684
Well, that's ...
- Is hearty.

01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:55.644
Yes.

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:58.435
God, how can you just stand,
under the same roof with her ...

01:02:58.566 --> 01:03:00.683
Especially when...

01:03:01.987 --> 01:03:05.856
I think that things
always develop as they should.

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:41.228
Okay, go!
- You have something?

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:43.772
I sent it Charlie.
My friend at Warner Books.

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:45.144
Without a word to Ben?

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.818
I've used a different name.
I just want some feedback from the expert.

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:50.358
I thought that if Charlie
Ben says that it is good,

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:53.736
then motivates him that perhaps that
Writing to pursue serious.

01:03:53.872 --> 01:03:56.205
You lose when all your cheating
someday the overview.

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:58.666
Do a Flowchart.
- Is really bad, right?

01:03:58.793 --> 01:03:59.909
Not in our industry.

01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:02.378
That makes it somehow worse.

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:03.541
Wait a moment.

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:06.794
This is Doria.

01:04:06.968 --> 01:04:09.255
I should at least one
Create half-truth from the world.

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:11.845
Good luck, Boss. Let me know,
if I have to call the ambulance.

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:15.683
Doria!

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:50.838
Is a football game.

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:52.711
Minnesota to Oklahoma.

01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:55.969
We can switch if you ...
- Oh no. I love football.

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:00.094
Mag bacon and loves football.

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:02.767
Who are you?

01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:12.030
How did you sleep?

01:05:13.993 --> 01:05:15.109
Quite well.

01:05:17.122 --> 01:05:19.239
And you?
- Quite well.

01:05:21.793 --> 01:05:23.500
Have your snoring missing.

01:05:25.797 --> 01:05:27.129
Did yours also missing.

01:05:28.508 --> 01:05:30.670
I do not snore yet!
- Yes, you do.

01:05:30.802 --> 01:05:33.590
No, I do not. You're snoring!

01:05:33.721 --> 01:05:37.590
Did you like this about not been said?
- As a truck driver.

01:05:46.317 --> 01:05:47.353
Hi.

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:50.148
Hi.

01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:56.699
You are so Beautiful.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:05.121
I have to say what, Ben you.

01:06:07.255 --> 01:06:08.211
It's really important.

01:06:08.339 --> 01:06:10.001
Now you cut me, you two.

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:11.795
I'll quite red.

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:15.382
I know, otherwise there's other
Knabberkram for Football, but ...

01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:17.804
That cost me a lot of money.
- This has probably.

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:20.182
And there is something to eat,
no work of art, so ...

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:21.596
Here.
- Thank-you.

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.099
Maybe it's art.

01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:26.563
That was a piece of my Veneer.

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:28.523
I think that was two
Months in the shop window.

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:30.643
Oh, you eat the house already?
- No!

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:32.523
Is my Veneer okay?

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:34.396
How should I know that?
- Watch for times.

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:35.943
Show me.

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:37.657
I guess so.

01:06:38.203 --> 01:06:39.785
Ho, the game!

01:06:41.122 --> 01:06:43.785
OK honey. I do not know,
What did you put there,

01:06:43.917 --> 01:06:44.873
but it tastes like ne beltway.

01:06:45.793 --> 01:06:47.159
Please listen to me.

01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:49.662
There is important news,
I have to tell you.

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:54.796
It gives me no joy,
To be the bearer of such messages.

01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:56.881
But you were all lied to.

01:06:59.807 --> 01:07:02.140
That woman is a spy.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:04.639
You mean, she works for the CIA?

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:07.684
No, not like ne
real spy-spy.

01:07:07.815 --> 01:07:09.807
She's a reporter.

01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:12.435
For "Gossip Pulse".

01:07:12.737 --> 01:07:15.400
She's with us
crept to spy on us

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:18.195
and to write a Tannehill story.

01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:21.360
That is quite a charge.
- She has

01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:26.582
on the children's festival and on the
Ball entertain with the same man.

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:30.669
I discovered,
that the man was a reporter

01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:33.130
and myself have done a little research.

01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:37.673
And I found out,
that Greta Kane ...

01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:40.968
in truth is a gossip reporter.

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:43.807
Yes, but she is the girlfriend of Ben.

01:07:44.852 --> 01:07:47.720
Ben, please. I can...
- No. She's not my girlfriend.

01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:51.933
Please, I just wanted to ...

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:53.809
This was all just a lie.

01:07:57.198 --> 01:08:00.236
Our first encounter,
your stay here,

01:08:00.368 --> 01:08:01.529
everything played.

01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:03.869
All because you my ex-girlfriend
anschleppst here without warning.

01:08:03.997 --> 01:08:05.033
I tried to call.

01:08:05.164 --> 01:08:06.700
Your car and all that ...

01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:10.368
The Snow Bride on the run,
that was all just made up?

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:11.960
The car has really pinned.

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:14.876
I thought you help me
because you're a good person.

01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:17.125
You wanted you only gain access.

01:08:17.468 --> 01:08:18.675
Easy...

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:36.527
What Claire says is true.

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:40.322
I am a reporter.

01:08:41.158 --> 01:08:42.821
And I should write a story.

01:08:42.993 --> 01:08:46.658
Because there was a tip that one of the
Brothers bought an engagement ring.

01:08:46.788 --> 01:08:49.076
Now that is also
a story about me.

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.791
How could you hurt me so?

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:54.044
I should be all
find out what I could.

01:08:54.589 --> 01:08:56.421
And what did you find out?

01:08:58.176 --> 01:09:03.136
That you are a family.
A wonderful family.

01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:07.804
And I hired conjectures
have, just because of prejudice.

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:12.179
I was wrong.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:18.444
I am so sorry. It
I'm so terribly sorry.

01:09:20.531 --> 01:09:24.399
But I make sure that no
Story will be released upon you.

01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:28.283
Not from me.

01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:33.451
You've got your car keys.

01:09:35.587 --> 01:09:37.420
You can go now.

01:09:48.643 --> 01:09:49.804
Excuse me.

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:53.729
Sorry.

01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:05.774
Greta!

01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:08.076
Just a sec.

01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:15.617
You'd almost forgotten.

01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:19.125
Thank you.

01:10:19.674 --> 01:10:21.836
Drive carefully, okay?

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:42.519
This is Kevin's family
not further notice.

01:10:43.114 --> 01:10:45.572
It has no sleeves!
- But the stain is out.

01:10:46.868 --> 01:10:47.984
Do you hate me?

01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:50.653
Honestly?

01:10:51.205 --> 01:10:52.696
I think it looks great!

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:54.949
Who wants to have puffed sleeves?
- Good.

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:57.459
But what is more important:

01:10:57.587 --> 01:11:01.547
this dress, this love tradition,
brought you to your dream man.

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:05.964
Oh, the thinks I had lied to him
and will never speak to me again.

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:08.508
At least you're not a drama out of it.

01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:11.348
Say honestly, how do you feel?

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:17.680
Guilt, shame, inconsolable ...

01:11:18.399 --> 01:11:22.188
But maybe that means ...
- Depressed, terribly angry ...

01:11:22.361 --> 01:11:24.569
I understand that totally.
- Lonely,

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:28.190
sad, frustrated ...

01:11:29.494 --> 01:11:33.659
Wistful, nervous public.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.577
Now repeat do not permanently.

01:11:36.584 --> 01:11:38.746
Have you tried calling him?
- No.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:41.207
Or tried to reach him otherwise?

01:11:41.339 --> 01:11:43.296
What do I mean?
Even more humiliating?

01:11:43.424 --> 01:11:45.962
Maybe he missed you
exactly as you miss him.

01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:49.344
His phone works.
And he did not call me.

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:51.714
Does not sound like
he'd miss me.

01:12:33.474 --> 01:12:35.215
Do not be mad at me, Ben.

01:12:41.732 --> 01:12:44.315
I had the truth
find out about Greta,

01:12:47.822 --> 01:12:51.486
because I still
Have feelings for you.

01:12:52.159 --> 01:12:55.277
I have done everything for love.

01:13:02.253 --> 01:13:03.539
I love you, Ben.

01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:09.420
Love?

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:14.796
Yes love.

01:13:16.434 --> 01:13:20.098
Are we completely interchangeable for you?

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:22.437
You're engaged to my brother.

01:13:22.982 --> 01:13:26.020
Yes, but that was, that was a mistake.
I should never have to say "Yes".

01:13:26.152 --> 01:13:27.814
I was in a panic.

01:13:30.573 --> 01:13:33.065
Ben, you're there. You
are there always has been.

01:13:35.828 --> 01:13:38.787
Just because my father
did not want to play.

01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:44.869
And to be clear, Claire,

01:13:46.714 --> 01:13:48.956
I also do not play with.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.797
Please go. Immediately.

01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:57.385
For I am Jared now
Tell the truth. The whole truth.

01:13:57.516 --> 01:13:59.303
And when I did that,

01:14:00.061 --> 01:14:04.180
then is your last chance,
to be a Tannehill past.

01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:07.474
Forever.

01:14:18.746 --> 01:14:19.987
Seriously?

01:14:20.998 --> 01:14:23.331
You can not
simply run away from me.

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:25.325
We have been through so much together.

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:28.044
And I have yet so much done for you!

01:14:28.506 --> 01:14:30.418
But that's the problem.

01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:35.510
I hate you!

01:14:36.097 --> 01:14:37.929
You said degree, you love me.

01:14:38.057 --> 01:14:40.640
And you're my brother
engaged. So what now?

01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:42.600
That's a good question.

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:44.474
Oh, shut up!

01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:46.772
You are together with me,
to obliterate him one.

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:49.357
I would never a
Stockbroker married.

01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:54.608
I'll call a cab.

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:16.093
I would sooner what to say.

01:15:19.974 --> 01:15:21.306
No, how did you should know

01:15:21.434 --> 01:15:24.472
I fall in love with your ex
and then as a show depart.

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:27.012
It is not your fault.

01:15:27.815 --> 01:15:29.977
We never find in life.

01:15:32.653 --> 01:15:34.519
Keep looking.

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:41.531
Do you remember when we were little,
We were looking for reindeer tracks.

01:15:42.288 --> 01:15:44.029
Yes. And when we had found that,

01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:47.123
... That was real Christmas magic.

01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:49.083
Could we use now.

01:15:49.587 --> 01:15:50.953
In any case.

01:15:59.972 --> 01:16:01.133
You are welcome.

01:16:01.474 --> 01:16:03.431
What are you doing there?

01:16:03.976 --> 01:16:06.434
Diamonds in the snow looking.

01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:08.178
That's romantic.

01:16:08.314 --> 01:16:10.522
This just came for you.

01:16:11.609 --> 01:16:14.147
Sender: "Doria Dress."

01:16:15.654 --> 01:16:17.111
Say that again.

01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:20.816
I provide no
Information about the fir Hills.

01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:23.243
That's why you went there since.
- I know.

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:27.038
You shoot your
Transport in the wind,

01:16:27.166 --> 01:16:30.830
because you do not have some spoiled,
rich celebrity politicians want to report?

01:16:30.961 --> 01:16:33.544
So they are not, Lou.
They are really quite nice.

01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:35.129
I do not know.

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:37.544
And you wanted something
earlier also do not know.

01:16:38.385 --> 01:16:39.876
But now.

01:16:41.472 --> 01:16:42.462
Listen.

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:45.432
I know Maggie Tannehill
for over 40 years.

01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:48.393
If I say, the family is
Fair game, then it's fair game.

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:50.846
Come on, Lou, why
is that so important to you?

01:16:50.981 --> 01:16:53.849
Jared Tannehill wants
married, who cares?

01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:56.146
That's really not a good story.

01:16:57.113 --> 01:16:59.981
Is it when the same woman
the brother and the father together.

01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:01.277
She had nothing to do with the father.

01:17:01.408 --> 01:17:03.525
A detail.
- But an important one!

01:17:03.828 --> 01:17:06.195
Now he can not
fight more against it, right?

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:09.786
And this story is an instant
bombastic online Start grant.

01:17:10.084 --> 01:17:11.700
That's a lie and
violates the privacy.

01:17:11.836 --> 01:17:13.498
If you pull through this, I quit.

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:15.712
And if you do not
by draw, then I fire you.

01:17:16.507 --> 01:17:17.793
It's your decision.

01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:21.756
Do you already know what you want to do?

01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:23.128
No Idea.

01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:25.802
But from the
Tabloids I've enough.

01:17:26.267 --> 01:17:28.850
Wherever you land, you must
then please bring me to you.

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.219
For the duplicate content.

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:36.020
If you are already a celebrity
verfällst, then that was the right one.

01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:40.442
Yes. But the thinking now, I'm the
Source and will hate me even more.

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:43.193
But who is the source?

01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:52.286
The Lord, you can tell everything.
- I am anxious to hear your stories.

01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:58.713
Of course.
- What do you want to do now?

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:02.842
The only thing I can.

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:18.482
What do you want here?

01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:21.445
Please give me five minutes.
- I gave you enough.

01:18:21.572 --> 01:18:23.404
It is because of Claire.

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:28.697
I do not know one hundred percent,
what they are writing,

01:18:28.829 --> 01:18:31.697
But Senator Tannehill is
not good to get away under warranty.

01:18:32.499 --> 01:18:34.491
You have no evidence.
- You do not need.

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.327
Well, let's threaten halt
by legal means.

01:18:37.463 --> 01:18:39.045
That would come too late.

01:18:49.516 --> 01:18:51.178
Lou Blanco?

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:53.726
I connect with Maggie Tannehill.

01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:57.018
Hey, Lou!

01:18:57.691 --> 01:19:00.604
Yes, it's insanely long ago.

01:19:01.362 --> 01:19:04.730
Of course I remember.
I remember everything!

01:19:05.532 --> 01:19:08.696
Listen, Lou, I
got great news.

01:19:08.827 --> 01:19:10.693
It's been a few days,

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:13.037
because I have my lawyers
commissioned purchasing

01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:15.373
of "Pulse Gossip"
to lead in the way.

01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:17.333
And our common
Girlfriend Greta Kane

01:19:17.461 --> 01:19:20.420
raves in the highest
Tones of you and your team.

01:19:21.966 --> 01:19:24.003
I beg your pardon?

01:19:24.385 --> 01:19:26.547
She no longer works for Pulse?

01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:28.841
We need to retrieve quickly.

01:19:28.973 --> 01:19:33.263
I have quite a few ideas on how we
can put it in the company.

01:19:33.394 --> 01:19:35.636
Oh, because I still think of one thing.

01:19:36.397 --> 01:19:37.854
If my information is correct,

01:19:37.982 --> 01:19:41.976
is you a story right to the
Claire Sinclaire has contributed something?

01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:46.234
This is not yet in
both our interests.

01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:49.232
Do not you think so? Good.

01:19:49.576 --> 01:19:51.317
I'll see you soon, Lou.

01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:55.823
Peters had a bit of
I researched about you,

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.491
After they arrived here.

01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:01.415
So you have ...
- Just know who you are.

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.337
Quasi from the outset.

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:05.252
Why did not you tell?

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:08.047
We were curious, while the
everything would develop, right?

01:20:08.178 --> 01:20:09.294
Very curious.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.592
I've decided,
To take precautions

01:20:11.724 --> 01:20:14.341
so no gossip story
published about us.

01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:16.342
So you buy really
a tabloid?

01:20:17.104 --> 01:20:18.436
Yes, obviously.

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:23.400
Although a small change of direction
is planned to seriöserem journalism.

01:20:23.527 --> 01:20:26.941
You have me consciously
tells what Claire has done.

01:20:27.072 --> 01:20:29.064
If you had tried to
For releasing information

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:31.191
I had known that we
You can not be trusted.

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:34.491
If not, does that mean
we can trust you.

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:39.450
You said you believe the things
develop as they should.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.167
I do.

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:43.995
But if necessary, get things
by me a little push.

01:20:45.549 --> 01:20:47.791
Greta, you want to
with us for dinner?

01:20:58.145 --> 01:21:00.808
Thanks, but I prefer to go.

01:21:06.862 --> 01:21:08.979
I hope you do not hate me for it.

01:21:39.978 --> 01:21:42.345
Greta has my novel
sent to a publisher.

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:45.148
Under an assumed name.

01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:47.980
Does he like them?
- You've written a novel?

01:21:49.571 --> 01:21:51.403
You want me on
talk a contract.

01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:53.902
Congratulations!

01:21:54.118 --> 01:21:56.826
That means now so that you
will not go into politics?

01:21:58.163 --> 01:22:00.871
It is, in any case, that
I have to think about a lot.

01:22:00.999 --> 01:22:02.865
Such as the name.

01:22:03.085 --> 01:22:05.668
Tannehill would be very good
make on a book cover.

01:22:05.796 --> 01:22:07.207
You know what I mean.

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:10.749
This is your dream, right?
To be a writer?

01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:11.795
Yes, it is.

01:22:12.803 --> 01:22:14.010
Then follow him!

01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:16.380
For sure?
- I've never been so sure.

01:22:16.515 --> 01:22:18.347
And never so proud.

01:22:26.733 --> 01:22:29.897
So, another issue: What is
now with you and Greta?

01:22:30.028 --> 01:22:31.769
Oh, Mom. She's ne gossip reporter.

01:22:31.905 --> 01:22:33.316
I was just their story.

01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:35.862
If you're just their story,
would have published them.

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:37.742
But if she has not.

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:37.593
Hi.

01:23:39.389 --> 01:23:40.550
Hi.

01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:46.345
How come you're here?

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:49.514
Very strange ...

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:52.392
A few days ago came the invitation.

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:55.152
With a map of "Doria Dress".

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.522
She did not.
- Yes, she has.

01:24:00.327 --> 01:24:03.536
One has to say: Looks much
better than last time.

01:24:03.747 --> 01:24:05.283
Full of dirt and snow.

01:24:05.415 --> 01:24:08.658
And then your ridiculous
Bride-to-the-flight history.

01:24:08.794 --> 01:24:10.456
Almost Bride.

01:24:10.754 --> 01:24:12.916
I was on the hunt for a story.

01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:18.794
And, Miss Kane,
They apparently found.

01:24:21.139 --> 01:24:22.880
What is missing is the end.

01:24:23.809 --> 01:24:25.471
It strikes me as a thing.

01:24:27.771 --> 01:24:28.852
Oh yes?

01:24:31.650 --> 01:24:32.686
Oh yeah.
