What class do you wanna take?

00:04.671 --> 00:05.923
Oh, anything that doesn't have the word

00:06.089 --> 00:09.259
"strip," "salsa," or "beatz"
with a Z in the name of it.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.595
Cardio Hip-Hop Groove it is then.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.013
Hey, what's up?

00:13.180 --> 00:13.847
Hey!

00:14.014 --> 00:16.850
Nothing, just... going into
the same class you're going into.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.311
Cool.

00:20.568 --> 00:22.680
That's a flower guy.

00:22.854 --> 00:23.940
Hey, I hope I don't sweat on you.

00:24.108 --> 00:25.609
You can sweat on me.

00:25.770 --> 00:27.861
This is my girlfriend, Liz Lemler.

00:28.029 --> 00:30.192
Hi!

00:30.485 --> 00:31.492
That's Liz Lemon.

00:31.656 --> 00:33.200
Oh, the girl who got my flowers.

00:33.367 --> 00:33.823
Yes.

00:33.995 --> 00:34.992
Hope you enjoyed them.

00:35.168 --> 00:37.572
I did--actually, I finally just
threw them out this morning

00:37.745 --> 00:40.202
'cause they got
that really bad flower smell.

00:40.375 --> 00:43.962
I kind of couldn't stop smelling them.

00:44.125 --> 00:45.293
Advanced hip-hop!

00:45.467 --> 00:47.000
You ready, here we go!

00:47.175 --> 00:49.753
Here we go, take it--
five, six, seven, and...

00:49.925 --> 00:50.711
One, huh!

00:50.886 --> 00:52.842
Hup, yeah!

00:53.017 --> 00:55.180
Uh! Whoo!

00:55.347 --> 00:56.720
Turn it!

00:56.896 --> 00:58.473
Don't give up, ponytail.

00:58.646 --> 01:01.972
Come on, you got this.

01:03.318 --> 01:05.269
Lemon, come here,
you've gotta see this.

01:05.447 --> 01:08.691
It's a video of a baby panda... sneezing.

01:08.867 --> 01:09.942
Sit here.

01:10.118 --> 01:14.742
Don't watch the mother,
just watch the baby.

01:16.367 --> 01:17.911
That is the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

01:18.077 --> 01:19.242
Isn't that adorable?

01:19.418 --> 01:21.870
You have to fire 10% of your staff.

01:22.045 --> 01:22.492
What?

01:22.668 --> 01:24.712
We're synergizing backward overflow.

01:24.875 --> 01:27.123
I don't write the policy,
Lemon, I only enforce it.

01:27.295 --> 01:29.131
No, but I've never
fired anybody in my life.

01:29.296 --> 01:30.882
It's an acquired skill.

01:31.046 --> 01:33.840
I'm not trying to make your life miserable,
but this is coming from the top.

01:34.017 --> 01:38.803
Now, there are 140 people on this show,
so go out there and make 126 people very happy.

01:38.976 --> 01:39.890
No, I don't think I can do that.

01:40.058 --> 01:43.183
Everyone that works
at this show is indispensable.

01:43.358 --> 01:43.472
Marco.

01:43.646 --> 01:44.100
Polo!

01:44.275 --> 01:44.433
Marco!

01:44.605 --> 01:45.811
Polo!

01:45.988 --> 01:46.100
Polo!

01:46.278 --> 01:47.440
Polo!

01:47.608 --> 01:51.572
Josh, you suck at this game, man.

02:10.675 --> 02:13.050
10%? I can't fire any of these people.

02:13.216 --> 02:13.633
Who cares?

02:13.805 --> 02:15.921
Getting fired is better
than getting killed by my wife.

02:16.095 --> 02:19.223
Those big farm people hands
crushin' my windpipe.

02:19.387 --> 02:20.642
Everything okay at home, buddy.

02:20.805 --> 02:24.521
Remember that little secret I told you
about Hornberger family planning?

02:24.686 --> 02:27.141
You mean that you flat-out lied
about getting a vasectomy?

02:27.315 --> 02:28.940
Don't tell me that backfired.

02:29.108 --> 02:30.400
She's late now.

02:30.566 --> 02:32.611
And she's starting to ask questions.

02:32.776 --> 02:33.362
Oh, boy.

02:33.526 --> 02:34.481
Do you need a key to my apartment?

02:34.657 --> 02:35.900
Just for my own safety.

02:36.076 --> 02:38.530
Hey, Liz Lemon, you know
where I can find a good church?

02:38.705 --> 02:41.032
How good, like Judaism good,
or just like Unitarian?

02:41.207 --> 02:44.330
My attorney told me I should
join a church preemptively.

02:44.496 --> 02:49.083
'Cause juries are suspicious of celebrities
who find religion after getting into trouble.

02:49.257 --> 02:51.210
Why don't you try the Church of Practicology?

02:51.388 --> 02:52.501
They love movie stars and stuff.

02:52.677 --> 02:53.923
They already turned me down.

02:54.098 --> 02:56.051
I'm still not sure
what happened.

02:56.216 --> 02:57.970
I believe the moon doesn't exist.

02:58.135 --> 03:00.932
I believe that vampires are
the world's greatest golfers,

03:01.097 --> 03:03.350
but their curse is that
they'll never get to prove it.

03:03.518 --> 03:06.642
I believe that there are 31 letters
in the white alphabet.

03:06.815 --> 03:10.730
Wh--what was the question again?

03:11.066 --> 03:12.903
So what's your religion, Liz Lemon?

03:13.067 --> 03:18.241
Mm, I pretty much just do
whatever Oprah tells me to.

03:20.405 --> 03:21.781
Can I help you?

03:21.958 --> 03:22.992
Yes, sweetheart.

03:23.167 --> 03:24.322
I'm looking for Jack Donaghy.

03:24.495 --> 03:25.660
And you are?

03:25.836 --> 03:27.911
Eddie Dona-hee, Jack's brother.

03:28.087 --> 03:28.542
Really?

03:28.705 --> 03:29.962
'Cause Jack never mentioned a brother.

03:30.125 --> 03:33.420
And his name is Dona-gee,
not Dona-hee.

03:33.586 --> 03:36.593
You know, you could be pretty
if you didn't scowl so much.

03:36.755 --> 03:38.803
Tracy, this is Jack's brother, Eddie.

03:38.967 --> 03:41.130
Hi.

03:41.688 --> 03:44.680
Look who I found.

03:47.147 --> 03:49.313
Eddie Donaghy.

03:49.475 --> 03:52.690
As I live and breathe.

03:52.857 --> 03:54.230
You're a disgrace!

03:54.407 --> 03:56.193
You're not the boss of me, Jack Donaghy!

03:56.366 --> 04:00.151
That's Dona-gee, not Dona-hee!

04:00.905 --> 04:01.702
You ruined my suit!

04:01.866 --> 04:03.280
Aw, shut up, you baby!

04:03.458 --> 04:03.990
Oh, my God, stop!

04:04.165 --> 04:05.742
Someone's gonna get hurt!

04:05.918 --> 04:08.160
Look, this is about Dad.

04:08.336 --> 04:09.372
What'd you two dirtbags do now?

04:09.546 --> 04:11.500
Fix the Cotton Bowl?

04:11.668 --> 04:14.042
Dad's dead.

04:14.215 --> 04:17.171
It's over.
Okay?

04:20.386 --> 04:23.341
This watch was Dad's.

04:23.515 --> 04:27.011
He wanted you to have it.

04:33.896 --> 04:34.731
Are you okay?

04:34.905 --> 04:37.271
Yeah, I'm okay.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.980
I haven't seen my dad in 17 years.

04:40.156 --> 04:42.742
I haven't seen Eddie
since I bailed him out of Disney jail.

04:42.905 --> 04:44.072
And now this watch.

04:44.246 --> 04:45.240
I'm sorry.

04:45.417 --> 04:46.413
Don't be.

04:46.575 --> 04:49.873
My dad and Eddie are a blotch
on the Dona-hee name--

04:50.046 --> 04:52.871
Dona-gee name.

04:54.796 --> 04:56.501
That's how it's pronounced.

04:56.678 --> 04:57.131
Say it.

04:57.298 --> 04:57.712
Donaghy.

04:57.885 --> 05:00.253
Right.

05:02.888 --> 05:05.680
I really appreciate you bringing me
to your church, Ken.

05:05.846 --> 05:07.012
Hola, Julio.

05:07.186 --> 05:12.601
I'm glad to help you
on your spiritual quest, Mr. Jordan.

05:14.985 --> 05:16.772
What kind of Presbyterian is this?

05:16.947 --> 05:19.900
No, we're the Eighth Day Resurrected Covenant
of the Holy Trinity.

05:20.076 --> 05:21.733
We haven't been Presbyterian for months.

05:21.908 --> 05:23.863
And y'all always meet on Wednesday nights?

05:24.035 --> 05:28.573
Yeah, we lose half the congregation
every time American Idol starts up.

05:28.748 --> 05:30.120
Reverend Gary's starting.

05:30.285 --> 05:31.951
God sees the wicked one.

05:32.127 --> 05:34.870
Eternal damnation is upon the sinner.

05:35.047 --> 05:37.082
The stench of rotten flesh fills the air.

05:37.256 --> 05:40.632
Judgment is upon us all!

05:40.798 --> 05:43.050
How will you be seen in his eyes?

05:43.217 --> 05:43.922
What?

05:44.097 --> 05:45.593
He pointed right at me!

05:45.765 --> 05:47.011
He sure did!

05:47.186 --> 05:48.590
No!

05:48.767 --> 05:52.973
The fires of the pit crackle and pop.

05:53.225 --> 05:54.390
Hi, I got you coffee.

05:54.607 --> 05:55.100
Thanks.

05:55.274 --> 05:56.560
Oh, I forgot your muffin!

05:56.738 --> 05:58.449
Banana walnut, your favorite.

05:58.600 --> 06:01.901
Uh, that's not correct, but okay.

06:02.079 --> 06:03.360
Good morning, Liz.

06:03.537 --> 06:04.741
What's all this?

06:04.905 --> 06:08.530
Sketches, promos, web content.
Thoughts for next season.

06:08.707 --> 06:10.532
Uh-huh. Nice hat.

06:10.707 --> 06:12.492
You haven't heard anything
about layoffs, have you?

06:12.665 --> 06:14.451
What? No!

06:14.627 --> 06:17.001
And even if I had,
I'm just being normal.

06:17.167 --> 06:18.371
Gosh.

06:18.547 --> 06:19.170
Okay.

06:19.335 --> 06:19.830
Hey, Liz!

06:20.008 --> 06:20.922
You wanna hang out tonight?

06:21.088 --> 06:22.670
'Cause you're totally my role model.

06:22.847 --> 06:25.553
You make smart sexy.

06:25.715 --> 06:26.881
There's my beautiful boss.

06:27.055 --> 06:27.671
Good morning!

06:27.846 --> 06:31.052
Good morning, Henry.

06:35.316 --> 06:37.983
There you go.

06:38.145 --> 06:39.691
The YMCA, huh?

06:39.856 --> 06:42.401
Congratulations, you've found me out.

06:42.567 --> 06:44.362
So your life's a mess,
you go out and buy a new suit,

06:44.536 --> 06:46.573
pretend everything's okay.

06:46.745 --> 06:48.452
But...what happened, Eddie?

06:48.616 --> 06:50.492
What do you care?
I'm happy here.

06:50.665 --> 06:53.371
Gordon, so help me!

06:53.535 --> 06:56.701
Look, I went broke
taking care of Dad-- end of story.

06:56.876 --> 06:58.002
Then let me give you some money.

06:58.167 --> 07:01.120
No, seeing Dad at the end,

07:01.298 --> 07:03.171
it changed me, Jack.

07:03.345 --> 07:04.423
I got a real job now.

07:04.597 --> 07:07.131
I talk homeless people
into joining the Army.

07:07.308 --> 07:08.921
Isn't there anything that you want?

07:09.096 --> 07:11.182
One thing.

07:11.347 --> 07:13.601
I'd like my brother back.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.891
Look, I know I've been nothing
but trouble to you your entire life.

07:17.068 --> 07:20.230
Juvie, Jonestown,
that time I punched Goofy.

07:20.397 --> 07:22.731
Hell, I even blinded you
with a bottle rocket!

07:22.905 --> 07:25.442
Ah, that was for a couple
of lousy months, big deal.

07:25.616 --> 07:27.032
I had sex with your prom date.

07:27.195 --> 07:28.402
I stole your identity.

07:28.578 --> 07:29.442
I threw you out of a window.

07:29.617 --> 07:30.861
I convinced you you had lupus.

07:31.037 --> 07:32.323
I microwaved your parakeet.

07:32.497 --> 07:34.321
I hated that bird.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.292
We had some great times, didn't we?

07:36.455 --> 07:38.751
Yeah.

07:47.097 --> 07:51.133
Hmm, you're on my good list, Cary.

08:00.818 --> 08:03.061
Hey, sorry about that.

08:03.238 --> 08:04.771
Not super appropriate...

08:04.948 --> 08:05.900
in the workplace.

08:06.066 --> 08:07.322
No, it's...

08:07.485 --> 08:11.070
it's only inappropriate
when it's ugly people.

08:11.247 --> 08:13.700
So, um, how long
have you guys been together?

08:13.867 --> 08:15.741
Oh, well... that's tricky.

08:15.917 --> 08:18.451
Uh, kind of off and on the past year.

08:18.625 --> 08:21.373
But then she got
this job here, and...

08:21.546 --> 08:26.631
It's kinda tough to stay broken up
with someone you have to see everyday.

08:26.795 --> 08:28.213
Where does she work?

08:28.387 --> 08:29.210
Your Liz.

08:29.385 --> 08:30.552
In accounting.

08:30.716 --> 08:32.052
On your show.

08:32.227 --> 08:35.303
She works for you.

08:40.438 --> 08:43.772
I know who I can fire!

08:46.105 --> 08:48.731
You can't fire the other Liz
unless she's in the bottom 10%.

08:48.905 --> 08:51.243
Ugh, you can just tell she is
by her stupid face!

08:51.406 --> 08:52.952
You're a better person than this.

08:53.116 --> 08:55.110
Jack has given me absolute power.

08:55.287 --> 08:56.953
I am the decider.

08:57.127 --> 08:59.080
Okay, you can't just do this.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.872
I'm not gonna just do anything.

09:01.047 --> 09:02.202
I have a plan.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.421
Step one, befriend the enemy
and gather information.

09:05.586 --> 09:09.383
Then use the information to drive her
into the bottom 10%.

09:09.555 --> 09:11.510
Good Lord...your eyes.

09:11.675 --> 09:14.930
You look like that lady astronaut
who tried to kidnap that other woman.

09:15.098 --> 09:16.640
Hey, that was a lady with a plan.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.353
Diapers, Mace, Houston to Orlando
in nine hours?

09:19.515 --> 09:20.723
Blammo.

09:20.895 --> 09:22.350
I know I'm the guy
who lied to his wife

09:22.528 --> 09:25.442
about having a vasectomy,
but this...

09:25.605 --> 09:26.693
this is wrong.

09:26.855 --> 09:28.230
No, it's not wrong!

09:28.405 --> 09:31.230
I'm just staying the course,
and I'm enjoying it.

09:31.408 --> 09:33.743
Jack is out of my hair,
people are being nice to me.

09:33.905 --> 09:38.371
There's a guy I like in the building,
and I have the authority to fire his girlfriend?

09:38.538 --> 09:43.621
For the first time ever, things
are lining up for old Liz Lemon.

09:43.798 --> 09:46.172
Stop! Stop it!

09:46.338 --> 09:47.622
Jack, come on.

09:47.798 --> 09:50.040
Mr. Donaghy,
your assistant's been looking for you.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.840
Oh, thank you very much, Kenneth.

09:52.005 --> 09:57.221
Uh, Eddie and I have just been
making up for some lost time.

09:57.386 --> 10:01.050
Hey, Jack, uh, you mind
if I take a few grapes for dinner later?

10:01.225 --> 10:02.473
Why don't you just take the money?

10:02.645 --> 10:03.641
No.

10:03.818 --> 10:06.140
If you wanna give money to someone,
you give it to those nurses

10:06.316 --> 10:09.150
who took care of Dad
at Chicago All Saints Hospital.

10:09.316 --> 10:13.441
They never once said anything
about the racist stuff towards the end.

10:13.616 --> 10:15.651
All right, I'll have
my assistant write a check.

10:15.827 --> 10:16.743
Help yourself to some grapes.

10:16.907 --> 10:19.991
But you had to go to the bathroom,
so Dad missed seeing Meredith Vieira!

10:20.167 --> 10:21.583
Now I'm pissed!

10:21.747 --> 10:24.703
Not one of you kids is
ever gonna amount to anything.

10:24.878 --> 10:26.541
That's why your mom left.

10:26.718 --> 10:28.372
Yeah.

10:28.546 --> 10:31.041
Maybe we should get all the Donaghy kids
back together again.

10:31.215 --> 10:32.671
Aw, Jack, they don't wanna see me.

10:32.847 --> 10:35.673
Oh, come on, we're Irish.

10:35.847 --> 10:37.513
We're a forgiving people.

10:37.677 --> 10:39.183
Aww!

10:39.345 --> 10:40.970
I'm so glad you asked.

10:41.145 --> 10:45.721
Kabbalah is a wonderful religion
that mixes the fun part of Judaism with magic.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.183
So where do you worship?

10:47.357 --> 10:50.102
Where don't you worship?
My friend, Madonna...

10:50.278 --> 10:51.230
Hey, Jack's brother.

10:51.405 --> 10:52.732
What religion are you?

10:52.907 --> 10:55.650
This one sounds really expensive and gay.

10:55.827 --> 10:58.323
Oh, well, uh,
I'm Irish Catholic.

10:58.498 --> 11:01.820
Now, I know there's been a lot of controversy
around the church lately.

11:01.997 --> 11:03.951
You know, because of The Da Vinci Code.

11:04.126 --> 11:06.082
But what's great is you can do anything,

11:06.255 --> 11:11.921
anything, and as long as you go
to confession, it's forgiven.

11:12.087 --> 11:15.213
I'm Irish Catholic.

11:16.636 --> 11:18.590
Well, well, other Liz.

11:18.766 --> 11:22.971
Played saxophone
in the marching band at Rutgers?

11:23.145 --> 11:25.511
Kept that a secret
from your employer, didn't you?

11:25.687 --> 11:26.682
Excuse me, Liz.

11:26.856 --> 11:29.140
Jack said it'd be okay
if I put this here.

11:29.316 --> 11:31.902
It's, uh, for the hospital
that took care of my dad.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.572
Oh, yeah--I'm so glad to see
you and Jack getting along.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.153
Uh, absolutely, we--
we'll give money, right?

11:37.328 --> 11:38.440
You want us to give money?

11:38.616 --> 11:40.363
I'd be happy to.

11:40.538 --> 11:42.240
Heart of gold, L.L.

11:42.417 --> 11:44.120
Is there a limit
to how much we can give?

11:44.285 --> 11:45.081
I hope not.

11:45.247 --> 11:46.241
Let's get our checkbooks!

11:46.417 --> 11:47.621
Yeah!

11:47.797 --> 11:48.751
Wow.

11:48.918 --> 11:51.293
I bet Pops is looking down
right now and saying,

11:51.467 --> 11:57.171
"If I could come back and do any broad,
it'd be that one right there."

11:57.346 --> 11:59.512
Ew.

12:03.265 --> 12:06.103
So Pop says, "What does it
look like I'm doing right now?"

12:06.266 --> 12:11.102
So they ended up landing
in Dallas for six hours and it was on the news!

12:11.278 --> 12:14.402
It was not on the news,
you're such a liar.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.192
Excuse me, everybody, this is Kenneth.

12:17.366 --> 12:18.781
Kenneth, this is my family.

12:18.948 --> 12:21.863
That's Patrick, this is Patricia,
this is Katherine Catherine,

12:22.108 --> 12:25.742
and her husband Bobby,
and this is, uh, Margaret.

12:25.915 --> 12:27.411
We just found out about her today.

12:27.587 --> 12:28.912
Oh, uh, welcome!

12:29.085 --> 12:31.081
Kenneth's going to take you all
downstairs to the studio.

12:31.257 --> 12:33.173
I would like to make
a toast to Pop.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.332
Well, we've been toasting Pop
for over an hour now.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.002
Maybe we should pace ourselves.

12:37.176 --> 12:39.132
You know what, why don't you stop trying
to control everything, Jack?

12:39.308 --> 12:41.380
He was a wonderful father.

12:41.556 --> 12:43.932
He was always ready with a joke.

12:44.096 --> 12:48.562
Or rum balls in his pockets for the kids.

12:51.816 --> 12:54.193
Eddie?

12:57.238 --> 12:59.983
Come here, you magnificent douche bag!

13:00.205 --> 13:02.530
Eddie!

13:02.908 --> 13:06.110
How the hell are ya?

13:07.167 --> 13:07.911
Have a drink.

13:08.087 --> 13:13.461
Uh, actually I've been clean
and sober for seven months.

13:15.177 --> 13:17.463
Stop showing off and have a drink.

13:17.635 --> 13:19.921
Sure.

13:25.228 --> 13:25.882
Hey, Liz.

13:26.056 --> 13:28.302
Oh, hey, Liz.

13:28.478 --> 13:30.893
Right, so I'm doing
these quick performance reviews.

13:31.065 --> 13:34.521
I'm gonna be doing them with everybody
every six months or so, so, um,
are you settling in okay?

13:34.695 --> 13:36.903
Yeah, everyone's been great.

13:37.068 --> 13:38.273
Learning where stuff is.

13:38.447 --> 13:41.071
What would you say are your weaknesses?

13:41.235 --> 13:43.783
Some people say
I'm too nice.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.863
Where do you see yourself in five years?

13:46.038 --> 13:48.371
Well, hopefully,
I'll still be working for G.E.

13:48.535 --> 13:50.743
It's a great company for working moms.

13:50.915 --> 13:51.493
What?

13:51.665 --> 13:53.503
You know, in five years.

13:53.668 --> 13:55.213
In--I mean, I'm in a relationship right now.

13:55.378 --> 13:58.673
By then I'll probably have a couple of kids,
be living in the suburbs--

13:58.838 --> 14:00.543
just having it all, really.

14:00.717 --> 14:03.510
You're fired!

14:04.427 --> 14:07.383
I'm the decider!

14:12.935 --> 14:14.601
Uh...

14:14.778 --> 14:16.230
God, I missed you guys.

14:16.398 --> 14:19.523
It's too bad it took Dad dying
to get us all together again.

14:19.695 --> 14:21.823
He was always bringing people together.

14:21.985 --> 14:23.613
He was just like Lady Di.

14:23.788 --> 14:24.740
He was.

14:24.908 --> 14:26.571
This is Margaret.

14:26.747 --> 14:29.280
Boy, she's really got
Mom's smile, doesn't she?

14:29.455 --> 14:29.992
Yeah.

14:30.168 --> 14:31.123
To Pop!

14:31.285 --> 14:33.621
The sorriest bastard
that ever walked the earth.

14:33.797 --> 14:35.333
Don't say that about my daddy!

14:35.507 --> 14:37.753
Oh, Patricia, you're embarrassing yourself.

14:37.927 --> 14:43.091
Yeah, well, you don't say that
about my father, Mrs.!

14:44.468 --> 14:45.302
What do you say...

14:45.467 --> 14:46.762
Good posture, who cares?

14:46.926 --> 14:48.723
Uh, what do you say
we all head downstairs right now

14:48.887 --> 14:52.721
before this takes the traditional
Donaghy turn for the worse.

14:52.896 --> 14:54.680
Seriously, don't even start with me!

14:54.858 --> 14:58.060
Don't start with me, Mrs.!

14:58.235 --> 14:58.522
You did it, you fired her?

14:58.698 --> 14:58.982
Uh-huh.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.440
You cant' do that, Liz!

15:00.606 --> 15:01.770
I'm gonna tell human resources!

15:01.946 --> 15:03.022
No, no, you're not!

15:03.196 --> 15:04.571
You're fired!

15:04.735 --> 15:05.730
Did you just fire Pete?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.861
Yes! I'm gonna put his name on a list!

15:08.035 --> 15:10.950
And everything!

15:13.628 --> 15:14.662
Can I help you?

15:14.836 --> 15:19.963
Ms. Lemon, the, uh, accounting department
wishes to protest the firing of our colleague.

15:20.128 --> 15:20.963
Now, we have discussed it--

15:21.125 --> 15:22.213
You're fired!

15:22.385 --> 15:23.793
You're all fired!

15:23.968 --> 15:25.001
Clean out your desks!

15:25.178 --> 15:27.550
Fired!

15:34.185 --> 15:37.430
Lemon, the purpose of these cuts
is to make us more efficient
so we make more money.

15:37.605 --> 15:40.190
And the people who tell me
if I'm making more money are called accountants.

15:40.358 --> 15:41.600
And if I don't have any accountants--

15:41.777 --> 15:43.273
No, Jack, you would be proud of me.

15:43.445 --> 15:44.521
It's all part of a plan.

15:44.695 --> 15:45.860
It just got out of control.

15:46.026 --> 15:47.573
A plan to do what?

15:47.738 --> 15:50.570
Things were really lining up for old Liz Lemon.

15:50.748 --> 15:53.412
And this other Liz,
this accountant girl,

15:53.577 --> 15:57.412
was just getting in the way
of my happiness.

15:57.586 --> 15:59.502
Your happiness?

15:59.665 --> 16:03.041
Lemon, is this about a boy?

16:03.217 --> 16:04.670
Mm-hmm.

16:04.848 --> 16:07.172
Good God in heaven.

16:07.348 --> 16:07.713
Who is he?

16:07.887 --> 16:09.211
What's his name?

16:09.386 --> 16:11.261
Flower guy?

16:11.437 --> 16:16.102
Lemon, you've gone chicken killer on me
over a guy whose name you don't know?

16:16.266 --> 16:18.933
And you still think our next President
should be a woman?

16:19.108 --> 16:22.980
He just seems like a really cool guy,
and I think he likes me more than her.

16:23.157 --> 16:26.231
That's...very sad.

16:27.117 --> 16:29.741
It really is, isn't it?

16:29.905 --> 16:34.411
I'm gonna go talk
to some food about this.

16:37.626 --> 16:39.581
Oh, Liz, did you
put your check in already?

16:39.755 --> 16:41.753
Oh, no.

16:41.915 --> 16:42.621
Who do I make it out to?

16:42.797 --> 16:44.672
Chicago All Saints Hospital?

16:44.838 --> 16:46.920
Eddie just said to write
the initials on the check.

16:47.097 --> 16:48.463
C...

16:48.637 --> 16:49.551
A...

16:49.717 --> 16:50.593
S...

16:50.766 --> 16:52.880
H.

16:55.058 --> 16:57.972
Son of a bitch.

17:00.818 --> 17:04.771
Eddie already took
the other box.

17:13.994 --> 17:16.242
Son.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.540
Dad?

17:21.708 --> 17:23.662
Your brother Eddie's dead.

17:23.835 --> 17:27.752
He wanted you to have his watch.

17:33.725 --> 17:35.841
Eddie.

17:36.017 --> 17:36.760
You.

17:36.936 --> 17:37.852
Me?

17:38.018 --> 17:39.473
You! What are you doing here?

17:39.648 --> 17:40.060
What do you think?

17:40.227 --> 17:42.771
I'm pulling
the Dead Man's Curve on Jack.

17:42.935 --> 17:45.233
When we parted ways,
we agreed that I would get Jack

17:45.397 --> 17:47.021
and you would do
the thing in Sacramento!

17:47.198 --> 17:49.610
You are both a disgrace
to the Donaghy name!

17:49.777 --> 17:54.031
It's pronounced Dona-fee,
you lace curtain half-an-Englishman!

17:54.197 --> 17:56.151
When I think of all the things
that I've been holding

17:56.328 --> 17:58.282
inside me that I wanted
to say to you...

17:58.455 --> 18:01.743
Well, now I'm gonna let St. Patrick
and St. Michael do my talking for me!

18:01.917 --> 18:05.462
You'll have to get through Tip O'Neill
and Bobby Sands first!

18:05.625 --> 18:07.421
You call those fist names?

18:07.587 --> 18:11.093
Say hello to Bono
and Sandra Day O'Connor!

18:11.257 --> 18:13.460
Those are the stupidest
fist names I've ever heard.

18:13.635 --> 18:16.263
Daddy's not dead!

18:16.436 --> 18:17.932
Eddie, you lying sack of crap!

18:18.097 --> 18:21.011
Jack Donaghy, you don't raise
your fists to my dead father!

18:21.188 --> 18:23.182
Bobby, give me my keys.

18:23.355 --> 18:24.183
Let's go!

18:24.358 --> 18:26.350
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:26.526 --> 18:27.192
Yeah, what--what are you doing?

18:27.356 --> 18:29.020
You can't fight in front of my audience!

18:29.196 --> 18:33.650
What, do you think
you're better than me?

18:34.578 --> 18:37.201
Lemon, are you okay?

18:37.366 --> 18:41.832
I want you...to punch
your sister in the face.

18:41.995 --> 18:42.533
It's on.

18:42.706 --> 18:47.333
I call same sides
as the bicentennial brawl!

18:48.126 --> 18:50.332
I was impressed by
how you take a punch, Lemon.

18:50.506 --> 18:52.963
I played dead for the worst of it,
but it didn't fool your family.

18:53.136 --> 18:54.422
It sure didn't.

18:54.597 --> 18:57.633
The whole thing was strangely reassuring, though.

18:57.807 --> 19:02.053
To know that they'll be there after I'm dead,
fighting over my corpse before it's

19:02.225 --> 19:04.060
cryogenically frozen.

19:04.225 --> 19:05.930
Where's Eddie now?

19:06.108 --> 19:10.732
I gave him and my dad a three-day
head start out of love and sportsmanship.

19:10.906 --> 19:12.273
Hmm.

19:12.448 --> 19:15.861
As always, it's been a pleasure
fighting with you.

19:16.037 --> 19:19.863
Oh, I had to rehire that Liz Lemler
that you fired.

19:20.037 --> 19:20.823
Okay.

19:20.997 --> 19:24.830
And I didn't want any more trouble with her,
so I had to give her a promotion too.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.042
Fantastic.

19:26.207 --> 19:31.713
It's an amazing opportunity for her out at,
uh, corporate headquarters.

19:31.886 --> 19:32.920
In Connecticut?

19:33.095 --> 19:34.841
She's transferred to Connecticut?

19:35.006 --> 19:35.923
Yes.

19:36.098 --> 19:37.671
That's right.

19:37.848 --> 19:42.302
It seems that things are lining up
once again for old Liz Lemon.

19:42.475 --> 19:43.431
And you say?

19:43.608 --> 19:44.812
Thank you, Jack.

19:44.976 --> 19:47.892
You're welcome.

19:57.577 --> 19:59.400
I hear your girlfriend got transferred.

19:59.578 --> 20:00.403
Sorry.

20:00.576 --> 20:01.453
Yeah.

20:01.615 --> 20:04.031
I guess it wasn't meant to be.

20:04.205 --> 20:04.781
Liz!

20:04.955 --> 20:05.783
You forgot to give me
the key to your place,

20:05.956 --> 20:09.162
and I need it, my wife knows
about our little secret.

20:09.337 --> 20:10.543
I don't know how she found out.

20:10.718 --> 20:11.582
Oh, God.

20:11.755 --> 20:13.383
I should've just gotten a vasectomy!

20:13.545 --> 20:16.463
Let me explain.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.461
Hey, did you hear the good news, J. D.?

20:19.635 --> 20:21.133
I'm IrisCatholic now.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.973
Like you, Regis,
and the Pope.

20:23.147 --> 20:24.603
Oh, no, you're not.

20:24.767 --> 20:26.560
The church already has enough lawsuits.

20:26.728 --> 20:29.470
See, I could screw up now,
and then just go to confession.

20:29.648 --> 20:33.060
No longer do I have to throw my parties
in international waters.

20:33.235 --> 20:34.443
That's not how it works, Tracy.

20:34.615 --> 20:37.443
Even though there is the whole confession thing,
that's no free pass.

20:37.615 --> 20:41.322
Because there is a crushing guilt
that comes with being a Catholic.

20:41.498 --> 20:44.993
Whether things are good, or bad,
or you're simply eating tacos in the park.

20:45.167 --> 20:49.241
There is always the crushing guilt.

20:49.548 --> 20:51.081
I don't think I want that.

20:51.256 --> 20:53.711
I'm out.

20:54.176 --> 20:57.251
Somehow I feel oddly guilty about that.

20:57.426 --> 21:01.381
I don't want nothing crushing me.

21:02.305 --> 21:08.488
