06:12.831 --> 06:13.999
I'm so sorry.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.418
That you park in fire lane.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.339
But don't worry,

06:17.460 --> 06:20.339
everybody make mistake

06:17.460 --> 06:20.339
some time.

06:20.379 --> 06:23.008
Yes, yes. And those who

06:20.379 --> 06:23.008
make mistakes

06:23.050 --> 06:25.426
take responsibility for them,

06:23.050 --> 06:25.426
so I'm not worried.

06:25.468 --> 06:26.887
As long as

06:25.468 --> 06:26.887
something gets done.

06:28.596 --> 06:29.848
Yeah.

06:28.596 --> 06:29.848
Maybe church help out.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.391
Maybe.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.391
Or someone else.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.811
Yeah.

06:34.853 --> 06:37.981
Okay, well, I'll leave you

06:34.853 --> 06:37.981
to think about that.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.440
I'll also need you

06:38.023 --> 06:39.440
to move your car.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.399
Okay. Yeah.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.486
Drive safe, Pastor Nina.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.198
Pastor Nina?

06:46.240 --> 06:47.448
I don't think

06:46.240 --> 06:47.448
she hear me.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.700
-[car engine starts]

06:47.490 --> 06:48.700
-Uh, yeah.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.287
There's hardly any room.

06:52.329 --> 06:53.955
My cartoon

06:52.329 --> 06:53.955
took up more space

06:52.329 --> 06:53.955
than I thought.

06:53.997 --> 06:56.208
Just sign on the back.

06:56.250 --> 06:59.169
Hey, Terence. I just need

06:56.250 --> 06:59.169
to take a quick look

06:56.250 --> 06:59.169
at Shannon's card.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.420
Sorry!

06:59.211 --> 07:01.420
Not falling for that again.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.841
You know you

07:02.547 --> 07:04.841
have pockets, right?

07:04.883 --> 07:06.593
-Falling for what?

07:04.883 --> 07:06.593
-Oh, let me think!

07:06.634 --> 07:09.763
A rude limerick

07:06.634 --> 07:09.763
with grammar and spelling

07:06.634 --> 07:09.763
mistakes attributed to me?

07:09.804 --> 07:12.557
Terence, I'm telling you,

07:09.804 --> 07:12.557
"cul de sac" does not mean

07:09.804 --> 07:12.557
what you think it means.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.101
Don't make me call HR.

07:14.142 --> 07:17.354
I just need the card.

07:17.396 --> 07:22.276
Hey, what would you think

07:17.396 --> 07:22.276
if I signed a card to you

07:17.396 --> 07:22.276
saying, "Love, Jung"?

07:22.317 --> 07:24.319
I just signed a card

07:22.317 --> 07:24.319
that was in Terence's pants.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.904
That's all I can

07:24.361 --> 07:25.904
really handle today.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.498
-How it's going?

07:35.914 --> 07:37.498
-Good.

07:37.540 --> 07:41.711
I hear yelling upstair.

07:37.540 --> 07:41.711
And lots of crash and

07:37.540 --> 07:41.711
bang and crying.

07:41.753 --> 07:44.464
Yeah. I bake

07:41.753 --> 07:44.464
Gordon Ramsey style.

07:44.505 --> 07:45.506
Lots of passion.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.676
Sound like Nanaimo bar

07:45.548 --> 07:48.676
giving you hard time.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.721
No. Just, uh,

07:48.718 --> 07:51.721
make another batch.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.721
Improve recipe.

07:51.763 --> 07:53.473
Recipe already is perfect.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.516
Maybe for you.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.186
Good luck.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.186
Second batch always

07:55.558 --> 07:58.186
is better.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.814
Yeah. Second batch. Ha!

08:00.855 --> 08:04.692
And, uh, maybe you want me

08:00.855 --> 08:04.692
make extra batch

08:00.855 --> 08:04.692
for Pastor Nina?

08:04.734 --> 08:06.403
-Why?

08:04.734 --> 08:06.403
-So she don't feel so bad

08:06.445 --> 08:08.529
about scratch on car

08:06.445 --> 08:08.529
that you make.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.282
On her almost new car.

08:10.324 --> 08:13.243
What you talking?

08:10.324 --> 08:13.243
I already deal

08:10.324 --> 08:13.243
with car problem.

08:13.285 --> 08:14.535
She park in fire lane.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.163
It's accident.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.163
She say so herself.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.290
I think she try to

08:16.204 --> 08:18.290
say something else.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.541
-What?

08:18.332 --> 08:20.541
-I not speak for her.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.419
Good. You learning.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.011
These quizzes

08:29.426 --> 08:31.011
are so dumb.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.305
It's like, "Yeah.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.305
I like this style of T-shirt,

08:33.347 --> 08:35.140
so that means

08:33.347 --> 08:35.140
I'm an introvert."

08:35.182 --> 08:36.724
You are an introvert!

08:36.766 --> 08:38.310
That was a bad example.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.561
I wish I could convince

08:38.352 --> 08:40.561
Ger to take a quiz.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.897
I feel like he needs to

08:40.603 --> 08:42.897
get in touch with himself,

08:40.603 --> 08:42.897
you know?

08:42.939 --> 08:44.441
-[cell phone vibrates]

08:42.939 --> 08:44.441
-Oh!

08:44.483 --> 08:46.401
Gerald wants to know

08:44.483 --> 08:46.401
if you're

08:44.483 --> 08:46.401
doing anything Friday?

08:46.443 --> 08:48.236
There's an oyster place

08:46.443 --> 08:48.236
we want to check out.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.071
Yeah, not really

08:48.278 --> 08:50.071
an oyster girl.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.407
-But they're a buck-a-shuck.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.407
-Oh.

08:52.449 --> 08:55.369
Maybe then. I mean, I might

08:52.449 --> 08:55.369
just come for a drink

08:52.449 --> 08:55.369
and have, like, one or two.

08:55.410 --> 08:56.953
Sure.

08:55.410 --> 08:56.953
'Cause they're so filling.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.246
-[cell phone buzzes]

08:56.995 --> 08:58.246
-[Chelsea giggles]

08:58.913 --> 09:00.623
What's so funny?

09:00.665 --> 09:03.043
Gerald just sent me

09:00.665 --> 09:03.043
the sunglasses emoji.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.170
It gets me every time.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.005
-[cell phone continues buzzing]

09:05.212 --> 09:07.005
-[giggling]

09:07.047 --> 09:08.465
Well, I got class.

[cell phone buzzing]

09:31.654 --> 09:33.490
[toilet flushing]

09:33.532 --> 09:34.615
[Gerald chuckles]

09:34.657 --> 09:35.742
[tap running]

09:36.659 --> 09:38.619
Oh! Hey, Gerald.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.122
Just in the kitchen.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.122
Washing a mug.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.624
I see that.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.585
-Hey, babe.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.585
-Hey.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.587
-I gotta go.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.587
-Oh, bye.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.631
-What?

09:49.256 --> 09:50.631
-[door opens and shuts]

09:50.673 --> 09:53.676
She washed her mug.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.676
That's, like,

09:50.673 --> 09:53.676
never happened.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.103
No more good table left.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.771
Maybe set up

10:03.144 --> 10:04.771
over there, huh?

10:05.813 --> 10:08.149
Ah! Mr. and Mrs. Kim.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.149
You're late!

10:08.191 --> 10:10.527
Yeah. Mrs. Kim take

10:08.191 --> 10:10.527
long time to park.

10:10.569 --> 10:13.654
Ah! Well, it's better

10:10.569 --> 10:13.654
to be safe than sorry.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.656
We here now.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.656
Where should we put?

10:15.698 --> 10:19.286
I'll leave it up to you.

10:15.698 --> 10:19.286
You always seem to know

10:15.698 --> 10:19.286
exactly what you want.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.414
-Uh-oh.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.414
-What?

10:22.456 --> 10:23.664
Pastor Nina mad at you.

10:23.706 --> 10:26.626
Not mad. Just, uh...

10:23.706 --> 10:26.626
busy serious.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.045
Right. Um...

10:30.880 --> 10:33.550
Uh, Pastor Nina.

10:33.592 --> 10:36.886
Sorry, but, uh, the table is,

10:33.592 --> 10:36.886
uh, kind of broken.

10:36.928 --> 10:39.013
Oh, dear!

10:39.055 --> 10:41.849
I guess someone damaged it,

10:39.055 --> 10:41.849
but didn't feel it was

10:39.055 --> 10:41.849
their responsibility to fix it.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.060
Who would do

10:41.891 --> 10:44.060
something like that?

10:44.102 --> 10:45.686
I don't know.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.686
Maybe caretaker?

10:45.728 --> 10:47.688
Oh, of course. Yes!

10:47.730 --> 10:49.690
Because it's a church table,

10:47.730 --> 10:49.690
so I guess

10:47.730 --> 10:49.690
the church should fix it.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.692
I just looking to help

10:49.732 --> 10:51.692
with bake sale.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.361
Oh, you want to help?

10:53.403 --> 10:56.114
She wants to help!

10:53.403 --> 10:56.114
She wants to help.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.740
This is because

10:56.156 --> 10:57.740
of a car scratch.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.284
It wasn't just a scratch!

11:01.411 --> 11:05.332
You wrecked my car

11:01.411 --> 11:05.332
and you didn't even

11:01.411 --> 11:05.332
offer to help pay for it.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.334
But why you don't

11:05.373 --> 11:07.334
say something?

11:07.375 --> 11:10.211
Because

11:07.375 --> 11:10.211
I was implying it passively,

11:07.375 --> 11:10.211
like a normal person.

11:11.838 --> 11:12.922
Huh.

11:14.299 --> 11:16.301
Yo, O-mars-bar! Hit it.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.719
Love you, man.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.430
Thanks, Jung.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.430
Appreciate it.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.722
Love you, too.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.724
Nice purse. Loving it.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.727
[chuckles]

11:23.766 --> 11:26.727
Hope these jokesters

11:23.766 --> 11:26.727
aren't bothering you.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.439
No. This man

11:26.769 --> 11:29.439
just made my day.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.732
Just spreading the love.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.732
Like always.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.277
To everyone.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.277
Cause it's my thing,

11:31.774 --> 11:34.277
you know?

11:34.319 --> 11:35.570
Great.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.572
Hey, Stace. Love ya.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.698
We talked about this.

11:39.740 --> 11:42.494
Um, can I chat with you

11:39.740 --> 11:42.494
for a sec?

11:42.536 --> 11:43.702
-Love to.

11:42.536 --> 11:43.702
-Mmm-hmm.

11:45.997 --> 11:49.000
So, I'm thinking

11:45.997 --> 11:49.000
you should maybe slow down

11:45.997 --> 11:49.000
the love train here.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.751
Why?

11:50.793 --> 11:53.046
Because you can't

11:50.793 --> 11:53.046
tell people you love them

11:50.793 --> 11:53.046
if you don't love them.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.382
Like, love-love them.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.757
Come on,

11:55.423 --> 11:56.757
it's no big deal.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.759
Saying it, not saying it.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.759
It's all the same.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.178
I think it is a big deal.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.762
Right. Got it.

12:01.804 --> 12:02.763
Then we're agreed.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.516
-Mos def.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.516
-Ooh!

12:04.558 --> 12:07.143
You can't say that either,

12:04.558 --> 12:07.143
but that's a story

12:04.558 --> 12:07.143
for another day.

12:11.939 --> 12:15.569
Wow! Mrs. Kim really

12:11.939 --> 12:15.569
went all out.

12:11.939 --> 12:15.569
These look great.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.778
-[chuckles awkwardly] Well...

12:15.610 --> 12:17.778
-Mmm!

12:17.820 --> 12:19.364
These are fantastic.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.990
-Yeah?

12:19.406 --> 12:20.990
-Mmm! What's your

12:19.406 --> 12:20.990
wife's secret?

12:21.032 --> 12:23.535
Uh, I think her secret is,

12:21.032 --> 12:23.535
uh...

12:24.827 --> 12:26.745
Me. I make.

12:26.787 --> 12:28.707
Well, these are delicious.

12:28.747 --> 12:32.793
Trick is each layer has to

12:28.747 --> 12:32.793
complete cool

12:28.747 --> 12:32.793
before adding next.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.795
I will have to

12:32.835 --> 12:34.795
remember that.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.297
Okay. See you.

12:36.339 --> 12:39.050
So many sweet things

12:36.339 --> 12:39.050
to look at.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.095
And the baked goods, too.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.095
[laughs]

12:42.136 --> 12:46.765
Jimmy, it's, uh, not so good

12:42.136 --> 12:46.765
doing like you doing.

12:46.807 --> 12:49.768
Come on!

12:46.807 --> 12:49.768
It's just the guys talking.

12:46.807 --> 12:49.768
No harm done.

12:49.810 --> 12:54.232
Actual, it's, uh,

12:49.810 --> 12:54.232
not just talking and

12:49.810 --> 12:54.232
you have to stop.

12:54.274 --> 12:57.277
Whoa!

12:54.274 --> 12:57.277
[imitates whip lashing]

12:57.318 --> 13:00.071
Sorry!

12:57.318 --> 13:00.071
Janice wanted to hear

12:57.318 --> 13:00.071
how you made them.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.240
Mr. Kim, you baked these?

13:03.408 --> 13:05.702
Yeah. I make.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.704
Well, tell your husband

13:05.744 --> 13:07.704
they're delicious.

13:07.746 --> 13:08.871
[both laugh]

13:09.748 --> 13:11.124
I don't get.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.834
Because you're like the wife.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.834
You baking, like a woman.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.503
[chuckles]

13:15.545 --> 13:16.837
But I'm a husband.

13:16.879 --> 13:20.508
But you baking,

13:16.879 --> 13:20.508
like woman, so, it's funny.

13:20.550 --> 13:21.842
You get it, right?

13:21.884 --> 13:24.887
Maybe you is confused,

13:21.884 --> 13:24.887
because you don't have a wife.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.222
[laughs]

13:30.851 --> 13:32.353
[store bell jingles]

13:32.395 --> 13:33.438
[Gerald] If I smell weird

13:32.395 --> 13:33.438
it's because

13:32.395 --> 13:33.438
a pack of teenagers

13:33.480 --> 13:35.690
surrounded me

13:33.480 --> 13:35.690
on the streetcar.

13:35.732 --> 13:36.941
Do you think I'm cheap?

13:36.983 --> 13:38.276
What?

13:38.318 --> 13:41.070
Not wanting to spend money.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.070
Classic Janey.

13:41.112 --> 13:42.614
[Gerald laughs awkwardly]

13:42.656 --> 13:44.491
[speaks French]

13:44.532 --> 13:46.534
I see by your nervous French

13:44.532 --> 13:46.534
I've struck a nerve.

13:46.576 --> 13:47.744
<i>Non.</i>

13:47.786 --> 13:49.287
I mean, no.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.872
Okay.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.872
I saw your text to Chelsea

13:49.329 --> 13:51.872
venting about me.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.040
You hacked me?

13:53.082 --> 13:54.875
It was all over her laptop.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.835
I've told her to

13:54.917 --> 13:56.835
disable those alerts.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.297
It's actually

13:57.920 --> 13:59.297
a pet peeve of mine.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.007
You know, sort of like

13:59.339 --> 14:01.007
how she always puts

13:59.339 --> 14:01.007
her toothpaste,

14:01.048 --> 14:02.509
like, right on her teeth.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.678
No. We are not talking

14:02.550 --> 14:04.678
about her right now.

14:04.719 --> 14:06.845
We are talking about

14:04.719 --> 14:06.845
you and her

14:04.719 --> 14:06.845
talking about me.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.264
I'm part of a couple now.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.890
I don't have any choice

14:08.306 --> 14:09.890
but to vent about

14:08.306 --> 14:09.890
you being cheap.

14:09.932 --> 14:13.687
How would you like it

14:09.932 --> 14:13.687
if I vented with Chelsea

14:09.932 --> 14:13.687
about you?

14:13.728 --> 14:16.147
[chuckles] Please.

14:13.728 --> 14:16.147
You and Chelsea

14:13.728 --> 14:16.147
aren't venting friends.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.899
You're not even

14:16.189 --> 14:18.899
"share a bag of chips"

14:16.189 --> 14:18.899
friends.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.694
We've shared chips.

14:20.735 --> 14:23.196
Baked, veggie,

14:20.735 --> 14:23.196
expensive chips that I bought

14:20.735 --> 14:23.196
with my own money.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.614
Maybe you want to

14:23.237 --> 14:24.614
think about that

14:24.656 --> 14:26.741
the next time

14:24.656 --> 14:26.741
you and Chelsea

14:24.656 --> 14:26.741
jam on Janet.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.910
-Thank you very much

14:28.075 --> 14:29.910
for coming.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.910
-[Umma] Pastor Nina?

14:29.952 --> 14:31.538
Pastor Nina.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.289
Can you excuse me?

14:31.579 --> 14:33.289
Thank you.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.504
I'm sorry about

14:36.959 --> 14:39.504
the scratch car

14:36.959 --> 14:39.504
not helping fix.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.088
I feel terrible.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.965
Oh, I don't feel

14:41.130 --> 14:42.965
so great either.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.760
Though it could be

14:43.007 --> 14:45.760
the macaroons,

14:43.007 --> 14:45.760
or the macarons.

14:45.802 --> 14:48.137
I couldn't remember

14:45.802 --> 14:48.137
which was which,

14:45.802 --> 14:48.137
so I went for both.

14:48.179 --> 14:50.264
I just want us

14:48.179 --> 14:50.264
to stop fighting.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.683
I pay for car repair.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.017
No! It's fine.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.477
I shouldn't have

14:53.059 --> 14:54.477
parked there

14:54.519 --> 14:57.938
and I should have been

14:54.519 --> 14:57.938
more clear about how I felt.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.650
Yeah.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.650
Because sometimes

14:57.980 --> 15:00.650
it's good to get mad.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.610
Note taken.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.654
But in the interest of

15:02.652 --> 15:04.654
avoiding any lingering guilt,

15:04.696 --> 15:06.030
I will pay

15:04.696 --> 15:06.030
for the damages.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.699
No, no, no. I pay.

15:07.741 --> 15:10.326
Otherwise you never stop

15:07.741 --> 15:10.326
reminding me

15:07.741 --> 15:10.326
how I scratch car.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.537
And you will never let

15:10.368 --> 15:12.537
the "fire lane" go.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.330
-But you did park in--

15:12.579 --> 15:14.330

15:17.083 --> 15:18.167

15:18.209 --> 15:19.960
Rawrr! Rawrr!

15:20.002 --> 15:22.046
Jimmy, enough!

15:22.088 --> 15:24.924
You can take

15:22.088 --> 15:24.924
your very generous

15:22.088 --> 15:24.924
cheque for the roof and...

15:26.008 --> 15:27.927
shove it!

15:27.968 --> 15:29.387
-Yeah! See?

15:27.968 --> 15:29.387
You tell him!

15:27.968 --> 15:29.387
-What?

15:29.429 --> 15:31.097
No. You can

15:29.429 --> 15:31.097
keep the cheque.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.849
Oh, and don't follow me.

15:32.891 --> 15:34.225
You do not want to be

15:32.891 --> 15:34.225
on the other side

15:32.891 --> 15:34.225
of my sugar crash.

15:40.857 --> 15:43.943
Your friend. Jung.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.737
Nailed it.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.655
Okay.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.655
Omar, you're next.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.115
Stacie, have you seen

15:47.697 --> 15:49.115
Shannon's birthday card?

15:49.156 --> 15:50.324
Omar's signing it.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.992
I knew I should have

15:50.366 --> 15:51.992
kept it in my pants.

15:52.034 --> 15:52.993
This is a new card.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.120
What happened to

15:53.035 --> 15:54.120
the old card?

15:54.161 --> 15:55.747
Uh, nobody wanted

15:54.161 --> 15:55.747
to touch it.

15:55.789 --> 15:56.997
[sighs]

15:57.039 --> 15:58.999
But my Handy Gang cartoon

15:57.039 --> 15:58.999
took hours.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.960
Omar's ears were murder.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.002
She's coming.

16:02.044 --> 16:02.962
Stall her.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.840
Kimchee didn't sign it.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.133
Here, I'll sign it for him.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.010
-Shannon! Hi.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.010
-Hi.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.430
-What's wrong?

16:10.052 --> 16:12.430
-Nothing. Um...

16:12.472 --> 16:17.685
But, now that you're here

16:12.472 --> 16:17.685
I just want to tell you how

16:12.472 --> 16:17.685
awesome I think you are.

16:18.394 --> 16:19.604
Aw. Thanks.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.398
Was there more?

16:22.440 --> 16:26.903
I think you're great

16:22.440 --> 16:26.903

I wish I may,

I wish I might...

I wish I may...

-The candles are melting.

16:38.623 --> 16:39.833
-Got it.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.043
[all] Yay!

16:43.085 --> 16:44.504

16:49.175 --> 16:50.593
Yeah. I sell out!

No. Mrs. Ham tell me

16:50.635 --> 16:53.053
you yell at Jimmy.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.055
Ah. He need new material.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.808
Always joke

16:55.097 --> 16:56.808
about the woman.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.058
Men is funny, too.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.394
Yeah.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.394
Have to be equal.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.521
[Umma sighs]

17:02.730 --> 17:06.025
So, you make up

17:02.730 --> 17:06.025
with Pastor Nina?

17:06.066 --> 17:07.652
Yeah. I talk to her.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.613
Tell her I feel bad and

17:07.694 --> 17:10.613
agree to pay half damage.

17:10.655 --> 17:14.158
What? With insurance

17:10.655 --> 17:14.158
we don't have to pay, huh.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.702
I can get for free.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.788
Yeah. And I can

17:15.743 --> 17:18.788
make Nanaimo bar

17:15.743 --> 17:18.788
with less than 60 egg.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.039
[Appa] Uh, maybe.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.834
You want to drive?

17:22.876 --> 17:24.961
[Umma] No.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.961
I get my driver to do.

17:25.003 --> 17:26.754
I am feminist!

17:25.003 --> 17:26.754
Not millionaire.

17:33.636 --> 17:35.095
Hey. What is it?

17:35.137 --> 17:37.097
Today, Kimchee stopped me

17:35.137 --> 17:37.097
to tell me how awesome I was,

17:37.139 --> 17:39.433
and then he wrote,

17:37.139 --> 17:39.433
"Love, Kimchee,"

17:37.139 --> 17:39.433
on my card.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.896
-Oh.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.896
-It's kind of weird, right?

17:42.937 --> 17:44.397
Maybe.

17:44.438 --> 17:45.565
Have I been

17:44.438 --> 17:45.565
sending out signals?

17:44.438 --> 17:45.565
'Cause I didn't mean to.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.149
I get that Time's Up.

17:47.191 --> 17:50.528
Actually, I'm the one

17:47.191 --> 17:50.528
that wrote "Love."

17:47.191 --> 17:50.528
I signed it for him.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.321
Oh. Did he not

17:50.570 --> 17:52.321
want to sign it?

17:52.363 --> 17:55.241
No. We all had to sign

17:52.363 --> 17:55.241
another card after I

17:52.363 --> 17:55.241
ripped up the first card.

17:55.282 --> 17:58.118
Okay... why?

17:58.160 --> 18:01.121
Because I wrote,

17:58.160 --> 18:01.121
"Love, Jung"

17:58.160 --> 18:01.121
on the first card.

18:01.163 --> 18:04.124
But I didn't do it on purpose,

18:01.163 --> 18:04.124
because I obviously

18:01.163 --> 18:04.124
don't love you.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.628
I mean, I like you.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.628
As a friend.

18:08.546 --> 18:11.298
But you wrote "love."

18:13.300 --> 18:15.135
I know. Um...

18:15.177 --> 18:17.805
But "love" like

18:15.177 --> 18:17.805
I love finding money

18:15.177 --> 18:17.805
in old clothing.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.974
Right.

18:20.016 --> 18:23.143
Or, like a seat

18:20.016 --> 18:23.143
becomes available

18:20.016 --> 18:23.143
on a crowded bus.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.813
I love that.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.813
I love you like...

18:27.314 --> 18:29.692
I love that.

18:29.734 --> 18:32.152
-Sorry to interrupt.

came for you.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.448
Aw!

18:38.200 --> 18:42.121
"For my special Shanns.

18:38.200 --> 18:42.121
From Alejandro."

18:44.373 --> 18:48.127
Oh, look!

18:44.373 --> 18:48.127
It's a milk frother.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.170
Now I'll have two.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.178
[Chelsea] So fun.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.806
Just thought as roomies

18:58.220 --> 18:59.806
we should hang sometimes.

18:59.847 --> 19:02.141
Just the two of us.

18:59.847 --> 19:02.141
Gal pals!

19:02.182 --> 19:04.143
Gal pals! [laughs]

19:05.227 --> 19:06.145
Mmm.

19:07.438 --> 19:09.023
Tasty cab sav,

19:07.438 --> 19:09.023
by the way.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.067
LCBO Vintage.

19:11.109 --> 19:12.318
It has a certain

19:11.109 --> 19:12.318
<i>je ne sais quoi.</i>

19:12.359 --> 19:14.070
Ah! French for yummy!

19:15.237 --> 19:16.781
Funny you should

19:15.237 --> 19:16.781
say that.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.532
Ever notice when Gerald

19:16.823 --> 19:18.532
speaks French?

19:18.574 --> 19:21.702
Ugh. He always does that,

19:18.574 --> 19:21.702
and it's so hot.

19:21.744 --> 19:24.538
He could totally rock

19:21.744 --> 19:24.538
a Parisian artist vibe.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.833
It would definitely be a step up

19:24.580 --> 19:26.833
from looking like a stagehand.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.208
Or a black light puppeteer.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.335
Exactly!

19:29.376 --> 19:31.211
Those guys are so cool.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.254
Are they?

19:37.093 --> 19:39.219
So, you know how when

19:37.093 --> 19:39.219
two people are close,

19:39.261 --> 19:41.388
they might share thoughts

19:39.261 --> 19:41.388
that other friends

19:39.261 --> 19:41.388
don't need to know about?

19:41.430 --> 19:42.556
Uh-huh.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.224
So if we were

19:42.598 --> 19:44.224
to share something,

19:44.266 --> 19:46.936
other people,

19:44.266 --> 19:46.936
like say, Gerald,

19:44.266 --> 19:46.936
might not need to know.

19:46.978 --> 19:48.395
Okay.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.564
I mean, we all wanna

19:48.437 --> 19:50.564
get something

19:48.437 --> 19:50.564
off our chest, right?

19:50.606 --> 19:51.649
Don't you feel

19:50.606 --> 19:51.649
that sometimes?

19:51.691 --> 19:53.943
I'm open.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.943
No judgment here.

19:53.985 --> 19:56.863
So if there's something

19:53.985 --> 19:56.863
you're thinking,

19:53.985 --> 19:56.863
just go with it and...

19:58.865 --> 20:00.950
Whoa. What's happening?

20:00.992 --> 20:02.451
I don't know.

20:02.493 --> 20:04.745
Just got caught up

20:02.493 --> 20:04.745
in the moment, I guess.

20:04.787 --> 20:08.248
With the wine and

20:04.787 --> 20:08.248
the sharing and the French.

20:08.290 --> 20:09.959
Right. Okay.

20:10.001 --> 20:13.253
Like you say,

20:10.001 --> 20:13.253
this can be our

20:10.001 --> 20:13.253
little secret thing.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.923
Yeah. That we don't

20:13.295 --> 20:15.923
continue to do.

20:16.423 --> 20:17.925
Sure.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.218
-Seriously.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.218
-Mmm-hmm.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.637
-Seriously!

20:20.302 --> 20:21.637
-Mmm-hmm.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.935
Hey! Did you see?

20:25.391 --> 20:27.935
Chelsea bought

20:25.391 --> 20:27.935
a black light.

20:27.977 --> 20:30.646
Black lights

20:27.977 --> 20:30.646
can be a lot of fun.

20:27.977 --> 20:30.646
Good for her.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.065
Oh, come on.

20:32.106 --> 20:34.108
Chelsea won't deal the dirt

20:32.106 --> 20:34.108
about you, either.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.527
She won't even sing

Nothing.

20:41.032 --> 20:43.159
Just drank some wine,

20:41.032 --> 20:43.159
had chips.

Yeah, that's it. Wink.

vented about me?

20:54.921 --> 20:57.297
Well, what did you

20:54.921 --> 20:57.297
talk about?

20:57.339 --> 20:59.466
Was it about

20:57.339 --> 20:59.466
how I use three towels

20:57.339 --> 20:59.466
when I shower?

20:59.508 --> 21:00.760

Yeah.

One for each section.

Well, we didn't

talk about you.

And, if we did,

I wouldn't tell you.
