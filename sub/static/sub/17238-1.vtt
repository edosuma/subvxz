00:14.959 --> 00:17.250
!

00:17.291 --> 00:19.417
-Noo!

00:19.458 --> 00:21.583
Oh my head!

00:21.625 --> 00:23.750
-Nooo! -Oh God!

00:23.792 --> 00:26.250
-Noooo. Ahh! -Ahh! Ahh!

00:26.291 --> 00:28.667
-Ahhh. Ahh.

00:29.792 --> 00:32.166
: We got married! Ahh! : Ahhhh.

00:32.208 --> 00:34.792
What the...?!

00:37.291 --> 00:39.542
: Ring bearer.

00:39.583 --> 00:41.709
-You've got to be kidding me.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.875
Oh no! Oh no!

00:43.917 --> 00:46.041
No. -Mmmm.

00:46.083 --> 00:48.208
Oh my God! Oh my God!

00:48.250 --> 00:50.625
You don't think that we...

00:50.667 --> 00:51.667
-Y'know...

00:52.959 --> 00:55.083
No! What

00:55.125 --> 00:57.000
!

00:59.208 --> 01:02.125
Can you finish your sentence? -It's okay, it's totally fine.

01:02.166 --> 01:06.542
'Cause, you know why? We're both fully clothed,

01:02.166 --> 01:06.542
so clearly, nothing happened!

01:06.583 --> 01:08.792
Yay!

01:08.834 --> 01:11.291
-No, no, I wouldn't be so sure of that.

01:11.333 --> 01:13.750
-But your shirt's still tucked in, Gerry.

01:13.792 --> 01:16.000
-Doesn't mean anything! That's my thing!

01:16.041 --> 01:19.750
-After I do "it", I get fully dressed. It's just something

01:16.041 --> 01:19.750
I've always done.

01:19.792 --> 01:22.667
-That is super weird, but I'm still dressed.

01:22.709 --> 01:24.834
And that's certainly not my thing. So...

01:24.875 --> 01:28.417
-Doesn't mean anything either, 'cause I dress the other person

01:24.875 --> 01:28.417
too.

01:28.458 --> 01:30.458
-That is so creepy, Gerry.

01:30.500 --> 01:34.792
-Creepy would be leaving you they're naked, while I'm fully

01:30.500 --> 01:34.792
dressed to the nines

01:34.834 --> 01:37.792
That would be creepy. But because I'm a gentleman...

01:37.834 --> 01:41.792
And I have class, I find your clothes and I put them on you.

01:41.834 --> 01:45.458
Perfectly! As I have possibly done in this case.

01:45.500 --> 01:49.542
-I'm gonna go to the shower and...Scrub...Everything.

01:53.458 --> 01:55.583
Like, what are you going to do

01:55.625 --> 01:57.875
♪  -Ahhhh.

01:57.917 --> 02:00.542
♪ I'm awesome, no you're not dude, don't lie ♪

02:00.583 --> 02:02.875
♪ I'm awesome, I'm driving around in my moms ride ♪

02:02.917 --> 02:05.625
♪ I'm awesome, a quarter of my life gone by ♪

02:07.041 --> 02:09.583
♪ I'm awesome ♪

02:10.792 --> 02:12.959
-Bell's gonna ring, let's get to class.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.875
-Gerry, we need to talk.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.834
About how you used me for my body last night?

02:17.875 --> 02:20.792
And wouldn't drive me to work. -No one can know about this.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.583
That was probably the best night you've ever had.

02:25.625 --> 02:27.750
For me, that's the lowest I've ever stooped, Lisa.

02:27.792 --> 02:30.500
-Oh, come on. -Rock bottom for Gerry Duncan

02:27.792 --> 02:30.500
last night.

02:30.542 --> 02:32.959
-That's great, I get it, okay.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.750
Mum's the word, alright? -I'm not telling a soul.

02:35.792 --> 02:38.792
It's embarrassing even walking in with you.

02:41.750 --> 02:44.750
-No, no, no, no, no.

02:44.792 --> 02:47.375
-In my country, when two people get married,

02:47.417 --> 02:51.125
we say "congratulations."

02:51.166 --> 02:54.166
-It means "all the best."

02:54.208 --> 02:56.333
-No, how do you know we got mar...

02:56.375 --> 02:58.250
You've been bragging all over town, haven't you?

02:58.291 --> 03:01.792
Are you crazy, Gerry? -I receive all-staff e-blast.

03:03.834 --> 03:06.000
-Congrats, sir. You too, Miss Mason.

03:06.041 --> 03:08.208
-The kids know. -The children. The children

03:06.041 --> 03:08.208
know.

03:08.250 --> 03:11.709
-You cc'd all student. A tad unprofessional, if you ask

03:08.250 --> 03:11.709
Malik.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.792
-Over the top.

03:14.834 --> 03:16.917
-My life is ruined.

03:16.959 --> 03:19.792
My life is over. ! Your life?!

03:19.834 --> 03:23.333
-This is creds for you. -Oh, come on!

03:27.667 --> 03:30.875
Guess what? -Oh, ahh...

03:30.917 --> 03:34.291
They found Uncle Tommy

03:34.333 --> 03:38.083
-Nope...I convinced mother to invite you over for dinner

03:34.333 --> 03:38.083
again.

03:38.125 --> 03:40.959
-I thought she hated me. -She...

03:41.000 --> 03:42.917
Did. But...

03:42.959 --> 03:46.917
It was nothing a little sweet Simon pillow talk couldn't fix.

03:46.959 --> 03:49.875
-I knew she wasn't a monster. -Be careful.

03:49.917 --> 03:53.500
-Anything...Except pie.

03:53.542 --> 03:55.792
Don't...Don't bring pie.

03:55.834 --> 03:58.000
-Yeah, I feel like pie was a real trigger last time.

04:00.583 --> 04:02.792
-I would say let's avoid the whole pie/cake family.

04:02.834 --> 04:06.709
Don't bring anything.

04:06.750 --> 04:08.875
-This is gonna be so fun.

04:12.458 --> 04:14.750
-Yeah...Okay...

04:16.792 --> 04:18.917
-Okay, let's open up our...

04:18.959 --> 04:21.083
Congratulations Mr...

04:21.125 --> 04:23.000
Ha. Very funny.

04:23.041 --> 04:25.166
Maybe you're not aware of how marriage works.

04:25.208 --> 04:27.250
For your information, when a woman marries a man

04:27.291 --> 04:30.625
she actually takes his last name. Because we are still...

04:30.667 --> 04:33.750
The king of the castle. So, that is a very ignorant comment.

04:33.792 --> 04:36.000
-Either way, good job marrying up, Mr. Mason.

04:36.041 --> 04:40.166
-Oh, yeah right! Pretty sure Ms. Mason is the one that

04:36.041 --> 04:40.166
married up.

04:40.208 --> 04:42.083
Obviously, girls

04:42.125 --> 04:45.000
-This is such a surprise, Mr. Mason. I thought

04:42.125 --> 04:45.000
you were gay.

04:47.208 --> 04:50.250
Pretty hand...'Cause I'm handsome? Pretty handsome.

04:47.208 --> 04:50.250
Is that why? That makes sense.

04:50.291 --> 04:54.041
-Mr. Mason, if you're such a good catch, are you saying

04:50.291 --> 04:54.041
you settled for Ms. Mason?

04:54.083 --> 04:57.041
Mr. Mason doesn't settle.

04:57.083 --> 04:59.583
'Cause Mr. Mason can get...

04:59.625 --> 05:02.500
Mr. Duncan...Mr. D...

05:02.542 --> 05:05.709
Can get who he wants to get, so I don't settle.

05:05.750 --> 05:07.875
Open your books. Let's go.

05:07.917 --> 05:10.041
-Ladies. -Oh hey, Lisa.

05:12.333 --> 05:16.750
-Well, Bobbi was just telling me about the time she made the

05:12.333 --> 05:16.750
worst mistake of her life.

05:16.792 --> 05:19.709
And how disgusted and ashamed she felt.

05:19.750 --> 05:22.417
-Mmm hmm and then Trudy was talking about how...

05:22.458 --> 05:25.875
She got super loaded one night and then married this huge...

05:25.917 --> 05:27.917
This huge loser. -Mmmm.

05:27.959 --> 05:31.709
: And then, of course we realized that we were both

05:27.959 --> 05:31.709
talking about you.

05:31.750 --> 05:34.041
-Yeah! So, awkward.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.000
-Okay, yes, I married Gerry.

05:36.041 --> 05:39.959
-And that was after he had publicly proposed to another

05:36.041 --> 05:39.959
woman.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.959
Which makes you Gerry's... -Just wait for this part.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.417
: Second choice for a wife...

05:45.458 --> 05:48.417
-Ahhh, wow! Let that wash over you!

05:48.458 --> 05:50.917
-That day. -Alright.

05:50.959 --> 05:53.083
I did a terrible thing. -Mmm.

05:53.125 --> 05:56.417
Guilty. But we've all done stupid stuff.

05:56.458 --> 05:58.625
: I don't think like that.

06:00.834 --> 06:04.083
Just...

06:04.125 --> 06:06.750
Bon appétit. -I don't know how you know that.

06:06.792 --> 06:09.250
-Oh, I must have told her. -Thank you.

06:09.291 --> 06:12.625
You and your brother...  Ewww!

06:12.667 --> 06:15.333
-Well, it's complicated. -Yeah, I should hope so.

06:15.375 --> 06:19.375
-It's disgusting! So let's cut Lisa a little slack.

06:20.750 --> 06:23.750
Okay

06:23.792 --> 06:25.750
-She's kinda right. -Yeah.

06:25.792 --> 06:29.208
Y'know, sometimes the heart wants what the stomach can't

06:25.792 --> 06:29.208
keep down.

06:29.250 --> 06:34.125
-I have the image of your brother in my mind. Ugh.

06:29.250 --> 06:34.125
-Yeah, me too.

06:34.166 --> 06:37.083
: Come on, come on.

06:37.125 --> 06:39.083
-This book is overdue.

06:39.125 --> 06:41.709
-Hey! don't you dare

06:39.125 --> 06:41.709
re-shelve that.

06:41.750 --> 06:44.291
Hello, Spencer. I wanted to offer my condolences...

06:44.333 --> 06:47.709
Oh, nobody died? Well that's surprising because your book's

06:44.333 --> 06:47.709
a week late.

06:47.750 --> 06:50.542
Please tell me you didn't

06:47.750 --> 06:50.542
dog ear that copy of

06:50.583 --> 06:52.166
Great Expectations.

06:53.417 --> 06:55.834
-Do you see what's going

06:53.417 --> 06:55.834
on here?

06:55.875 --> 06:58.625
-Ah, yes. You seem swamped.

06:58.667 --> 07:01.125
-I'll say it again.

07:01.166 --> 07:04.166
This library's the only thing standing between these kids and

07:04.208 --> 07:08.375
full blown, hard-core illiteracy and it is seriously

07:04.208 --> 07:08.375
understaffed.

07:08.417 --> 07:12.709
I need an assistant. -Well, what would you say to

07:08.417 --> 07:12.709
thirty assistants?

07:12.750 --> 07:14.917
-If you're not going to take me seriously...

07:14.959 --> 07:18.291
-I am though. Behold, the first shipment of e-readers.

07:18.333 --> 07:22.709
-It's the entire library at the

07:18.333 --> 07:22.709
push of a button.

07:22.750 --> 07:25.000
-That technology is light years away.

07:25.041 --> 07:27.834
-Can you help me find

07:25.041 --> 07:27.834
Animal Farm?

07:27.875 --> 07:30.291
-Sure, I'll just look it up here...

07:27.875 --> 07:30.291
-Ah, no need.

07:30.333 --> 07:33.083
-Locked and loaded, Connie. -But, you need to check

07:30.333 --> 07:33.083
that out.

07:33.125 --> 07:35.542
-She doesn't, see she's already checked in...

07:35.583 --> 07:39.458
: To the future. All you have to do is enter

07:35.583 --> 07:39.458
your student ID...

07:39.500 --> 07:42.583
And Robert's your uncle.

07:42.625 --> 07:44.875
It's usually Bob, but my name's Robert.

07:49.208 --> 07:51.750
-Well, I'll be damned.

07:51.792 --> 07:54.000
-Ms. Mason, I need to speak to you for a second.

07:54.041 --> 07:57.000
: Oooh! -No, we hardly like each other.

07:54.041 --> 07:57.000
Go to class.

07:57.041 --> 07:59.208
-Ah, listen babe...

07:59.250 --> 08:02.041
" -I...Yes, 'cause we're married.

08:02.083 --> 08:04.125
That's what you're supposed to do, I don't like it either.

08:04.166 --> 08:07.333
Speaking of which, we gotta go get this annulled right now.

08:10.291 --> 08:12.500
Principal or wife? -Your principal.

08:15.083 --> 08:17.875
-I do, I have the grade twelves.

08:17.917 --> 08:20.917
Don't tell anyone. -Gerry, you can't just...

08:20.959 --> 08:23.166
You know, this is way more important.

08:26.166 --> 08:28.750
-I was going to kiss you, 'cause I am your husband.

08:28.792 --> 08:30.917
-No! -But not in front of the kids.

08:28.792 --> 08:30.917
I get it.

08:30.959 --> 08:33.041
-Or anywhere else, in front of anyone else.

08:33.083 --> 08:35.500
-I don't know what I was thinking. Bad, bad Gerry.

08:35.542 --> 08:38.417
: Dumb idea.

08:48.375 --> 08:50.000
Well, this is nice.

08:51.500 --> 08:55.125
-Hi. -Oh Bobbi! So nice to see you!

08:51.500 --> 08:55.125
What can I help you with?

08:57.500 --> 08:59.875
-Sure do! I've been preparing for it all morning.

08:59.917 --> 09:01.792
-Okay, well we're going to go ahead and cancel that

09:01.834 --> 09:04.500
and just stay in the classroom and work off these e-readers

09:01.834 --> 09:04.500
instead.

09:04.542 --> 09:08.166
-Wait, you might want to reconsider because I put

09:04.542 --> 09:08.166
aside some nifty hardcovers

09:08.208 --> 09:12.083
about the digestive system and I think your class would really

09:12.125 --> 09:14.500
enjoy some of the pop up illustra...

09:18.125 --> 09:20.291
Never liked that bitch anyway.

09:24.417 --> 09:26.125
So, I was just...

09:27.000 --> 09:29.875
I was just tying my shoelace. So...

09:29.917 --> 09:32.458
What? -Nothing.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.458
: Oh.

09:35.291 --> 09:37.166
Pop up.

09:39.375 --> 09:41.458
-Before finalizing the annulment I need to ask a few questions.

09:41.500 --> 09:44.583
-Pft! I've been answering questions all day about this.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.625
-Well, people are surprised

09:44.625 --> 09:47.625
that I would...

09:47.667 --> 09:49.542
So I've been getting that all day.

09:49.583 --> 09:53.917
-Oh, right. So, was either party already married prior to the

09:49.583 --> 09:53.917
nuptials?

09:53.959 --> 09:56.125
-No, no one's every married me.

09:56.166 --> 09:59.083
-She did sleep with my roommate. Add that to your notes.

09:59.125 --> 10:04.208
-Does either party lack the mental capacity to understand

09:59.125 --> 10:04.208
what marriage entails?

10:04.250 --> 10:08.166
-No. -We do not understand that

10:04.250 --> 10:08.166
question.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.875
-Absolutely not.

10:10.917 --> 10:15.166
-Ah, we're still trying to determine that your honour.

10:10.917 --> 10:15.166
-No we're not.

10:15.208 --> 10:20.542
-I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you two were intoxicated at

10:15.208 --> 10:20.542
the time of marriage.

10:20.583 --> 10:22.458
: Annihilated.

10:22.500 --> 10:25.125
: Blackout.

10:25.166 --> 10:28.208
: Couldn't see a thing. Had I seen a thing, ahh uhh.

10:31.917 --> 10:34.333
-You know, I think we're there. I think we're done.

10:34.375 --> 10:37.125
: Okay. Wow. : There you go,

10:34.375 --> 10:37.125
you hold onto that.

10:37.166 --> 10:39.458
-Oh, thank God. -Phew! We got outta that.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.583
-Hey, you know the rule about bringing those into school.

10:43.625 --> 10:48.166
Spit the nuts out of your mouth or I'll give you something to

10:43.625 --> 10:48.166
really choke on.

10:48.208 --> 10:51.125
-Mr. Cheeley! About the e-readers...

10:51.166 --> 10:54.875
: Uh huh? New shipment just arrived. Just

10:51.166 --> 10:54.875
put a rush order in for more.

10:54.917 --> 10:57.208
-Thing is...I don't need any help.

10:57.250 --> 11:00.250
What's a few extra hours of unpaid overtime? It's no biggie.

11:00.291 --> 11:03.375
I hope you kept the receipt for all those...

11:03.417 --> 11:06.208
Silly, stupid e-readers.

11:08.667 --> 11:11.208
-I mean, look around. -Ah.

11:11.250 --> 11:14.500
: I mean...

11:14.542 --> 11:18.667
-Oh my God. -We might not even need

11:14.542 --> 11:18.667
a library anymore.

11:21.458 --> 11:23.792
Hey, it's lunch. Go play outside!

11:23.834 --> 11:26.875
-But I want to read from my tablet! You can't make me play!

11:26.917 --> 11:30.375
-Ah. -Loving the new e-readers,

11:26.917 --> 11:30.375
Ms. Terdie.

11:35.166 --> 11:37.333
-These mashed potatoes are so buttery.

11:37.375 --> 11:40.959
-Oh, thank you Nisha. Of course, it's margarine but how could

11:37.375 --> 11:40.959
you know?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.291
: This is so nice.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.750
My favourite lady sitting across from my other favourite lady.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.792
And me in between. Right in the middle.

11:47.834 --> 11:51.875
-Well, I'm so glad that we

11:47.834 --> 11:51.875
did this, Mrs. Hunt.

11:51.917 --> 11:54.041
I really want us to get along.

11:54.083 --> 11:56.875
-If my Simon is happy, then I'm happy.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.417
-What a nice thing to say.

12:03.959 --> 12:06.417
-I wonder who that is.

12:06.458 --> 12:08.417
Simon, do you mind? -Of course.

12:09.500 --> 12:12.166
: This is going really well.

12:09.500 --> 12:12.166

12:23.250 --> 12:25.792
-Mother, Soul Patch is here.

12:25.834 --> 12:29.333
-It's Steven. -Oh...It's Steven.

12:31.333 --> 12:34.834
Mother : Oh, excuse us.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.959
-Yeah.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.083
: Yes, honey: This was supposed

12:37.000 --> 12:40.083
to be an intimate threesome.

12:40.125 --> 12:42.625
What the heck is Soul Patch doing here?

12:42.667 --> 12:46.208
-You know how I feel about your pie peddling prostitute.

12:48.250 --> 12:52.375
-If you want me to give Nisha a chance then you give Steven

12:48.250 --> 12:52.375
a chance.

12:52.417 --> 12:55.333
Let's dance.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.458
-To the dissolution of our marriage!

13:06.500 --> 13:09.542
-Dodged a bullet. -You guys have had quite

13:06.500 --> 13:09.542
the forty eight hours.

13:09.583 --> 13:13.500
: Could you imagine us

13:09.583 --> 13:13.500
married?

13:13.542 --> 13:16.375
Your voice

13:16.417 --> 13:19.083
No, I could not. -Okay, pump the brakes there.

13:19.125 --> 13:23.542
Alright? You're no picnic yourself. I mean you're

13:19.125 --> 13:23.542

13:23.583 --> 13:26.375

13:26.417 --> 13:28.375
-When you thought we

13:26.417 --> 13:28.375
owned the house we rent.

13:28.417 --> 13:31.458
-Oh, sorry I'm not a bank manager who does mortgages.

13:31.500 --> 13:35.417
Or a real estate agent. -Well, po-tay-to po-tah-to.

13:35.458 --> 13:38.250
-To us. -To the end of us.

13:38.291 --> 13:40.417
-End of us. That's what I meant to say.

13:38.291 --> 13:40.417
-Yes.

13:40.458 --> 13:42.375
: Oh hoho.

13:42.417 --> 13:44.542
Oh boy, that's the one. -Ooh. Cheers.

13:44.583 --> 13:46.834

13:46.875 --> 13:49.375
: It's tequila flavoured. -Alright, special occasion.

13:49.417 --> 13:51.375
: I believe in you. -Nope.

13:51.417 --> 13:53.834
: Oh. -Nope. Nope. Nope.

14:08.291 --> 14:10.625
Mmm! These mashed potatoes are to die for.

-It ain't butter.

14:24.625 --> 14:27.333
-Oh, Nisha, I'm so glad you asked me that question.

14:27.375 --> 14:31.792
Motivational speaking is a calling, so I didn't choose

14:27.375 --> 14:31.792
it so much as...

14:31.834 --> 14:35.208
It chose me. -Okay. And, um...

14:37.333 --> 14:39.500
Did you have to study for it? Or...

14:39.542 --> 14:41.417

14:58.125 --> 15:00.625

15:00.667 --> 15:03.125
You're always putting things in my mouth.

15:08.625 --> 15:11.125

15:52.792 --> 15:58.875

17:07.834 --> 17:10.667

17:07.834 --> 17:10.667
left the bar.

17:12.667 --> 17:15.792
It's Lisa.

17:15.834 --> 17:18.250

17:15.834 --> 17:18.250
-It's Lisa, Bill!

17:18.291 --> 17:21.667

17:18.291 --> 17:21.667
her laugh and her personality.

17:21.709 --> 17:24.625
And the cat thing. What you have left is not half bad.
