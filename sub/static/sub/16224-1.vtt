01:00.744 --> 01:03.713
Don't stress. Just relax.

01:03.880 --> 01:05.575
I understand you can lose keys.

01:05.749 --> 01:08.343
You can lose your wallet.
How do you lose a plane?

01:08.518 --> 01:10.247
Reese, what do you want me to do?

01:10.420 --> 01:13.617
We got three out of four planes in.
That's a lot of coke.

01:13.790 --> 01:18.056
Now, that's the kind of winning attitude
that'll take this enterprise to the top.

01:18.228 --> 01:20.719
In all fairness, Reese, it wasn't his fault.

01:20.897 --> 01:23.866
Are you his attorney?
Why are you in the conversation?

01:25.235 --> 01:26.634
Come on, I'm kidding!

01:26.903 --> 01:29.428
- I'm just kidding with you.
- He loves to joke.

01:29.606 --> 01:34.134
Terrence here is absolutely right.
I mean, hell, three out of four ain't bad.

01:35.545 --> 01:37.604
Let's celebrate. Who wants a beer?

01:37.781 --> 01:39.146
- Great!
- Okay.

01:42.919 --> 01:45.786
- Baby!
- Coke. It costs money.

01:46.322 --> 01:48.415
Planes. They cost money.

01:48.691 --> 01:54.027
This yacht, this perm, my kid's braces, it all
costs money. Do you think Kitty's free?

01:54.197 --> 01:56.290
Kitty, turn around. Turn around!

01:58.601 --> 02:00.626
Reese, please put the gun down.

02:06.943 --> 02:11.778
Now, the next time that a plane
goes down, you better be on it.

02:12.949 --> 02:14.416
Will you do my back, please?

02:14.784 --> 02:16.479
- Sure.
- I don't wanna tan weird.

02:16.653 --> 02:17.915
- Am I tanning weird?
- No.

02:18.087 --> 02:19.486
- Honestly.
- You're bronzing.

02:29.299 --> 02:32.234
<i>There's no such thing</i>
<i>as a petty crime.</i>

02:32.669 --> 02:35.263
<i>No minor infractions.</i>

02:35.438 --> 02:37.030
<i>There's only the law.</i>

02:38.174 --> 02:40.540
Freeze! Bay City P.D.!

02:43.980 --> 02:46.471
<i>That's me in the leather jacket</i>
<i>and tight jeans.</i>

02:47.984 --> 02:50.817
<i>See that guy I'm chasing?</i>
<i>I hate him.</i>

02:50.987 --> 02:53.421
<i>And I'll do everything</i>
<i>in my power to stop him.</i>

02:53.590 --> 02:55.490
Wanna play, let's play.

02:55.658 --> 02:58.422
<i>Because it's my job to stop him.</i>

03:01.097 --> 03:03.156
Goddamn!

03:03.333 --> 03:06.825
<i>And the city pays me a damn</i>
<i>good salary to do my job.</i>

03:07.937 --> 03:10.872
<i>Besides, he crossed the line.</i>

03:11.341 --> 03:13.571
<i>And in Bay City,</i>
<i>when you cross the line...</i>

03:17.914 --> 03:19.745
<i>... your nuts are mine.</i>

03:21.084 --> 03:22.676
I said, freeze!

03:22.852 --> 03:26.083
<i>My name is David Starsky,</i>
<i>and I'm a cop.</i>

03:29.158 --> 03:32.457
<i>I've always had this theory</i>
<i>about police work:</i>

03:33.062 --> 03:35.758
<i>If you can't beat them, join them.</i>

03:41.537 --> 03:42.765
No! No! No!

03:48.945 --> 03:50.173
Put the money in there.

03:50.546 --> 03:53.743
<i>Too many cops worry about</i>
<i>the wrong thing: Crime.</i>

03:54.450 --> 03:57.715
<i>Not me, though.</i>
<i>I'm looking out for</i> numero uno.

03:57.887 --> 04:02.415
- Hey, old-timer. Put this on Dallas.
- Come on! Let's go!

04:04.494 --> 04:06.485
<i>I'm just a realist, that's all.</i>

04:06.663 --> 04:10.997
<i>And besides, you have any idea</i>
<i>how little the city pays us?</i>

04:12.201 --> 04:13.566
Freeze! Bay City P.D.!

04:14.370 --> 04:15.598
Take it easy.

04:16.706 --> 04:21.769
Guys, come on.
I'm undercover here.

04:26.582 --> 04:29.813
<i>My name is Ken Hutchinson,</i>
<i>and I'm a cop.</i>

04:30.820 --> 04:33.380
Where did they come from?

04:37.961 --> 04:39.758
<i>Jesus Christ, Starsky.</i>

04:39.929 --> 04:42.625
You fired three rounds
into a crowded intersection.

04:42.799 --> 04:44.528
We got a man with a broken hip...

04:44.701 --> 04:47.727
...and some asshole wants
a new top for his Caddy?

04:49.505 --> 04:51.632
That purse had $ 7 in it.

04:52.108 --> 04:55.407
- Okay, want my badge? Here, take it.
- Fine.

04:56.946 --> 04:59.540
Come on. I was just making a point.

05:00.249 --> 05:02.274
David, David.

05:02.452 --> 05:06.855
Your mother was one of the finest cops
Bay City ever seen.

05:07.123 --> 05:09.921
Twenty-two years on the force
with the same partner.

05:10.093 --> 05:15.861
You have had 12 partners
over the past four years.

05:16.165 --> 05:18.224
She died a legend.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.995
I am not my mother!

05:22.372 --> 05:26.502
I'm sorry.
Detective Hutchinson is here.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.507
Send him in. Have a seat.

05:31.314 --> 05:35.648
- How you doing, captain?
- I believe you two know each other.

05:35.818 --> 05:38.013
Yeah, a little bit. How you doing?

05:38.921 --> 05:40.218
- Yeah, right.
- Hutch.

05:41.090 --> 05:43.058
You've got a lot of explaining to do.

05:43.226 --> 05:46.957
I know. Look, I was trying to infiltrate
one of the East Side gangs...

05:47.130 --> 05:49.792
...and work my way up
to the big fish. It's simple.

05:49.966 --> 05:52.298
- You were robbing a bookie.
- That's right.

05:52.468 --> 05:54.299
You've robbed seven bookies.

05:54.470 --> 05:58.566
You haven't filed a report, turned
in any money or arrested anybody.

05:58.741 --> 06:00.538
How can I? They'll know I'm a cop.

06:00.710 --> 06:03.873
I wouldn't worry, you won't
be mistaken for a real cop.

06:04.047 --> 06:09.644
Oh, really? Why don't you go get yourself
another perm and let the grownups talk.

06:09.819 --> 06:12.481
- My hair is naturally curly.
- No, it's not.

06:12.655 --> 06:14.987
- Yes, it is.
- That's a perm job, all the way.

06:15.158 --> 06:16.785
Touch it!

06:17.527 --> 06:20.189
Hey! Why are you touching him?

06:23.399 --> 06:25.230
Jesus!

06:26.969 --> 06:28.960
You know something?

06:29.639 --> 06:32.574
You two deserve each other.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.670
Make nice. You're partners.

06:41.417 --> 06:43.112
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

06:43.286 --> 06:45.049
I don't know why you're so upset.

06:45.221 --> 06:48.713
The guy cost us 200 grand.
A "thank you" might be more appropriate.

06:48.891 --> 06:52.418
Who cares about 200 grand?
What if they link us to the murder?

06:52.595 --> 06:55.530
- They won't link us to the murder.
- You don't know that.

06:55.698 --> 06:57.928
Will you let it go, please? Jesus.

06:58.101 --> 07:01.002
- Take a lude. Calm down.
- I did, and I'm still pissed.

07:01.170 --> 07:04.003
Okay, fine. Fine, fine.
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

07:04.173 --> 07:08.007
I promise, I'm not gonna kill Terrence
again. Now, pull it together.

07:08.177 --> 07:09.940
Let's go.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.875
Gentlemen, I apologize
about the delay.

07:13.349 --> 07:16.910
But I promise you what we have
is worth the wait.

07:18.921 --> 07:21.913
- It looks like cocaine.
- That's because it is cocaine.

07:22.425 --> 07:26.657
With a twist. You see,
we've managed to find a way...

07:26.829 --> 07:29.889
...to alter the cell structure
of the coca plant...

07:30.066 --> 07:33.092
...giving it a heightened
perfluoralkylation process...

07:33.269 --> 07:36.966
...creating a new kind
of diazomethane.

07:37.273 --> 07:39.241
Gets a little complicated after that.

07:39.609 --> 07:40.940
Excuse me.

07:41.811 --> 07:44.302
So do you get extra high or what?

07:45.148 --> 07:48.345
Actually, it has all the same
effects as regular cocaine.

07:48.951 --> 07:51.852
Well, if it's the same,
why are we here?

07:53.856 --> 07:56.347
<i>Canis familiaris</i>. The German shepherd.

07:56.526 --> 07:58.926
Its nose has over
220 million scent receptors.

07:59.095 --> 08:03.327
It can detect smells that even the most
advanced technology in the world cannot.

08:03.499 --> 08:05.160
For example:

08:05.334 --> 08:08.462
Lvan, search!

08:15.878 --> 08:18.540
Lvan, stop!

08:21.317 --> 08:23.808
What do you got? You holding?

08:27.423 --> 08:29.687
He brought old coke.

08:31.194 --> 08:34.095
This is new coke.

08:34.996 --> 08:40.559
As far as a dog's concerned, there's nothing
there. 100 percent undetectable cocaine.

08:40.736 --> 08:42.635
Got no coke smell...

08:42.804 --> 08:44.739
...same coke ride.

08:45.908 --> 08:47.136
Tastes kind of sweet.

08:47.310 --> 08:51.178
If this shit wasn't illegal, guys,
we'd be up for the Nobel Prize.

08:51.581 --> 08:54.311
Our initial run pumped out
two tons of this stuff...

08:54.483 --> 08:57.043
...and it'll be available
in about three weeks.

08:58.154 --> 09:00.349
You boys know who to call.

09:01.090 --> 09:02.523
Ivan!

09:06.262 --> 09:07.661
<i>You don't understand.</i>

09:09.232 --> 09:10.824
They're not like you.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.161
They're criminals.

09:13.436 --> 09:16.405
Look, I know we all
got to make living.

09:16.572 --> 09:20.872
But these guys, they are dealing
hard drugs right in front of my shop.

09:23.079 --> 09:25.980
I can dig what you're saying,
Mr. Chowdury.

09:26.148 --> 09:29.549
- I wanna thank you for coming in today.
- Of course.

09:31.120 --> 09:35.147
Those gentlemen you speak of,
they'll no longer be a problem.

09:35.324 --> 09:36.689
You have my word.

09:37.893 --> 09:41.556
This is my neighborhood.
People tend to forget that.

09:42.565 --> 09:44.795
Bee Bee, make sure
he gets home safely.

09:44.967 --> 09:48.164
- Yeah, boss.
- Thank you very much, Huggy.

09:49.138 --> 09:50.366
You are a great man.

09:51.207 --> 09:54.074
- Begone, little Indian.
- Let's go, little man. Come on.

09:54.477 --> 09:56.377
Taking up time.

09:57.179 --> 10:01.047
- This neighborhood is in need of some help.
- It's cold-blooded, daddy.

10:01.217 --> 10:04.118
- Who's next?
- You got Hutch waiting outside.

10:04.287 --> 10:08.815
- What you got my man waiting outside for?
- He brought some extra fuzz with him.

10:08.991 --> 10:12.483
So what? You go get him
and get him in here now.

10:13.562 --> 10:15.996
You've never run an errand
on the clock before?

10:16.165 --> 10:20.761
I take care of my personal business after
work, when the taxpayers aren't paying me.

10:20.936 --> 10:24.133
Give me a break. You've never
stopped to buy a cup of coffee?

10:25.841 --> 10:27.069
I bring a Thermos.

10:28.577 --> 10:31.444
Okay, Hutch. He'll see you now.

10:31.614 --> 10:34.174
Wait here, I'll be back in five minutes.

10:41.357 --> 10:43.518
Second door on the right.

10:43.793 --> 10:46.227
- How you doing?
- Hi, Hutch.

10:54.003 --> 10:57.461
- Hey, look what the wind blew in.
- Huggy Bear.

10:57.640 --> 11:00.473
Hey, I want you to meet
my new partner, David Starsky.

11:00.643 --> 11:02.543
Hey, how you doing?

11:03.145 --> 11:05.670
Hey, nobody touches the Bear.

11:06.449 --> 11:07.677
Have a seat.

11:07.850 --> 11:10.546
- Hutch, the usual?
- You know it. Make it a double.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.347
Get my boy a Jack and Tab.

11:12.521 --> 11:14.682
- And double that.
- You got it, boss.

11:14.857 --> 11:18.725
- I'll get a seltzer with lime, if you got it.
- I don't got it.

11:20.029 --> 11:21.690
Or not. It's cool. I'm good.

11:21.864 --> 11:24.924
I just came by to apologize
for what happened in Chinatown.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.592
Let me tell you,
I was as surprised as you were.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.897
Don't sweat it, baby.
I wasn't surprised.

11:30.072 --> 11:31.801
You know I ain't never surprised.

11:32.908 --> 11:34.933
Hey, champ.

11:35.611 --> 11:38.136
You got a permit for that weapon
you're carrying?

11:38.314 --> 11:40.043
Starsky, please.

11:40.216 --> 11:42.912
No, I don't.

11:43.719 --> 11:46.483
Yeah, me neither.

11:49.291 --> 11:52.021
I'm sorry, did I say something
that was funny?

11:53.696 --> 11:56.028
- Stop it. He's kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.

11:56.198 --> 11:58.723
I wanna see permits
or I'm taking those weapons.

11:58.901 --> 12:01.597
Slow up, man.
Around here, we govern ourselves.

12:01.771 --> 12:04.433
Think of us like Luxembourg.

12:04.607 --> 12:06.268
- You dig?
- No, I don't dig.

12:06.509 --> 12:08.909
See, Luxembourg's
a constitutional monarchy...

12:09.078 --> 12:12.514
...a sovereign state established
after the Treaty of Vienna.

12:12.681 --> 12:17.175
Technically, it's a part of Europe.
But in reality, they govern themselves.

12:17.353 --> 12:20.083
- Like us.
- Just like us.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.059
All right, enough, okay?

12:27.363 --> 12:29.593
- Shit!
- Hold up! Hold up!

12:29.765 --> 12:31.790
Just chill out! Chill!
Watch yourself.

12:31.967 --> 12:33.935
- Oh, no. Hell, no.
- You okay?

12:34.103 --> 12:35.832
What happened?
Did he shoot Corky?

12:36.005 --> 12:37.939
Your boy shot his tail off.

12:38.107 --> 12:40.905
- He lost his tail?
- You should keep it in a terrarium.

12:41.177 --> 12:44.112
- Man, what the hell is a terrarium?
- What's a terrarium?

12:44.280 --> 12:48.478
It's an artificial ecosystem designed
to simulate Corky's natural habitat.

12:48.784 --> 12:51.753
Well, I can dig that.
But I say we shoot him in the ass.

12:51.921 --> 12:54.617
Oh, hell, yeah.
An eye for an eye.

12:54.790 --> 12:56.758
Take it easy.
Huggy, help me out here.

12:56.926 --> 13:00.225
Slow up, fellas. An iguana can lose
his tail and grow it back.

13:00.396 --> 13:03.923
He regenerates.
That's how he escapes his predator.

13:04.133 --> 13:07.591
It's true. It's a defense mechanism.
I read it in a magazine.

13:08.804 --> 13:13.468
So him shooting Corky's tail off
and us shooting him in the ass...

13:13.642 --> 13:17.669
...it really ain't the same thing.
- No, the punishment don't fit the crime.

13:17.847 --> 13:20.077
And besides,
it was an accident, right?

13:21.217 --> 13:22.445
Right.

13:23.352 --> 13:25.946
- So we're cool.
- We're always cool, breeze.

13:26.121 --> 13:28.214
Lower your pieces.

13:32.862 --> 13:37.765
<i>Good morning, Bay City, you are tuned</i>
<i>in to KBA Y, 93.3 on your dial.</i>

13:37.933 --> 13:42.199
<i>This next tune is number eight on</i>
<i>the charts and number one in our hearts.</i>

14:26.749 --> 14:28.649
Hey, Hutch!

14:29.418 --> 14:31.909
Oh, there he is.
What's going on, Willis?

14:32.087 --> 14:33.645
Same old, same old.

14:33.822 --> 14:36.620
So how's life at the clink
treating you?

14:37.159 --> 14:38.421
It's not that great.

14:38.594 --> 14:42.428
I got some new tight-ass partner
that they stuck me with and then...

14:42.598 --> 14:46.090
I don't know. Hopefully...
It's probably not gonna last that long.

14:46.669 --> 14:50.105
- So got that $20 you owe me?
- 20?

14:50.272 --> 14:52.365
Willis, I thought it was 5.

14:52.541 --> 14:55.032
Hutch, that was my grandmother's
birthday money.

14:55.210 --> 14:58.873
Come on, give me a break, okay?
I just told you I got a new partner.

14:59.048 --> 15:03.917
Stuff isn't great for me down at the
precinct. You know, back off for a second.

15:06.088 --> 15:09.717
- Can I get it to you on Thursday?
- Fine, but no later than Thursday.

15:09.892 --> 15:12.053
No later than Thursday.
Word of honor.

15:13.195 --> 15:14.423
Cute little kid.

15:25.074 --> 15:27.941
It's 10:00. You're late.
I've been here since 8.

15:28.477 --> 15:31.969
8:00? I didn't know this place opened at 8.

15:32.147 --> 15:37.346
Well, don't sweat it, because crime called
in sick. It's gonna get a late start too.

15:39.154 --> 15:41.554
"Crime called in sick," I like that.

15:41.890 --> 15:45.621
- So, what's on the agenda today?
- Same as every day.

15:45.794 --> 15:49.730
- Finding bad guys, bringing them down.
- Great. Take my car, right there.

15:50.165 --> 15:51.826
- That?
- Yeah.

15:52.001 --> 15:55.300
- What the hell is that?
- It's like a camper/pickup truck.

15:55.471 --> 15:57.439
- What's the matter?
- We're undercover.

15:57.606 --> 16:01.007
- That thing sticks out like a sore thumb.
- You think so?

16:01.276 --> 16:03.210
You're in for a treat.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.441
It's not that bad.

16:28.237 --> 16:31.229
Man, your stock just went up
in my book, my friend.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.705
Pop the hood. Let's see
what you got under...

16:33.876 --> 16:38.438
Hotshot, what do you think you're doing?
This is a Ford Gran Torino, okay?

16:38.614 --> 16:42.141
It's not some crappy camper/apartment.
There are rules.

16:42.317 --> 16:44.877
- Okay, okay.
- You do not bang on the hood.

16:45.054 --> 16:47.784
You never, under any circumstances, drive.

16:47.956 --> 16:50.618
You will not put your coffee mug
on the roof. Okay?

16:50.793 --> 16:55.321
No coffee in the car whatsoever. Coffee
on the ground, you get in the car, we go.

17:02.371 --> 17:06.704
<i>Attention, all units.</i>
<i>We've got a 61-40 at Bay City Marina.</i>

17:06.875 --> 17:08.308
Oh, no.

17:09.178 --> 17:12.636
This is Zebra 3.
We're on it. Hang on.

17:19.722 --> 17:21.848
You gotta be kidding me. No way.

17:22.023 --> 17:24.015
- What?
- Floater.

17:24.193 --> 17:28.323
Nothing harder to solve than a floater.
No prints, body's usually bloated...

17:28.497 --> 17:32.695
...it's next to impossible.
All right, I say we push it out...

17:32.868 --> 17:35.393
...hope the current
takes it to the next precinct.

17:35.571 --> 17:37.766
- What?
- You'll thank me for this one.

17:38.107 --> 17:40.803
- Hey, seriously, stop it.
- The key is not to pop it.

17:40.976 --> 17:43.774
- Hey.
- You gotta be very ginger.

17:43.946 --> 17:47.541
- What are you doing?
- I said, drop the stick.

17:47.716 --> 17:50.514
You point a gun at me?
Okay, fine, have it your way.

17:50.686 --> 17:52.119
Knock yourself out.

17:52.287 --> 17:55.723
- What are you gonna solve, anyway?
- I'm gonna solve a murder.

17:56.925 --> 18:00.952
Monday, June 3rd. Male Caucasian body,
apparently dumped from the Bay Bridge.

18:01.130 --> 18:05.328
Actually, there's no sign of impact,
so he was probably just dropped out at sea.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.901
Could you please not talk
while I'm recording?

18:08.070 --> 18:09.537
Thank you.

18:13.142 --> 18:16.270
All right, I'm just gonna call
in the meat wagon, all right?

18:16.445 --> 18:19.573
Looks like you punched
your last ticket, <i>amigo</i>.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.540
I'm sorry, did you just tough-talk
a dead body?

18:22.718 --> 18:24.413
I lost my flow.

18:28.490 --> 18:31.857
- Zebra 3 to base.
- <i>Dispatch. Go ahead, Zebra 3</i>.

18:32.027 --> 18:36.054
We're gonna need a coroner notification.
We got a DB down at municipal jetty.

18:36.231 --> 18:37.698
<i>10-4, will inform.</i>

18:37.866 --> 18:41.199
Tell them to bring a body bag
and some galoshes. He's a wet one.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.270
<i>Copy that, Starsky.</i>

18:43.539 --> 18:47.407
Found a wallet.
Nothing in it.

18:47.609 --> 18:49.406
- Medium-rare, okay?
- You got it.

18:49.578 --> 18:51.910
Look at all these cops.
You wanna eat here?

18:52.080 --> 18:54.480
It's a great place.
Pop's? Come on.

18:54.650 --> 18:57.050
"If you're one of the cops,
eat at Pop's."

18:57.386 --> 18:58.978
- Okay, hot stuff.
- <i>Zebra 3.</i>

18:59.154 --> 19:01.145
<i>2</i>- <i>11 in progress, please respond.</i>

19:01.323 --> 19:03.120
- Go for Starsky.
- <i>Hurry, Starsky.</i>

19:03.292 --> 19:06.693
We got two perps holding up
a gumball machine on 5th Street.

19:06.862 --> 19:09.160
- Let's go.
- A gumball machine?

19:09.331 --> 19:11.595
- Lethal force if necessary!

19:13.302 --> 19:15.167
Very funny, Manetti.

19:16.772 --> 19:18.672
Hey, it's Captain and Tennille.

19:18.841 --> 19:21.867
That means one of you would
actually have to make captain.

19:22.110 --> 19:25.944
- Radio's for police business only.
- That's true. Why'd they give you one?

19:26.915 --> 19:29.247
- Let's get out of here.
- Not that funny.

19:29.551 --> 19:32.611
That Manetti really thinks he's something.
But you know what?

19:32.788 --> 19:35.780
- He's not.
- Take it easy.

19:38.126 --> 19:42.062
- You think that's funny?
- No, no, I mean, you just gotta rise above it.

19:42.231 --> 19:44.426
- What do we got in the wallet?
- Not much.

19:44.600 --> 19:49.867
Driver's license, couple receipts.
No cash whatsoever.

19:52.074 --> 19:54.440
"Reese Feldman Corporation."

19:54.610 --> 19:56.373
What do you call that?

20:05.621 --> 20:07.316
<i>Terrence Meyers.</i>

20:07.489 --> 20:09.480
That name does sound vaguely familiar.

20:09.658 --> 20:12.718
- Isn't he part of our Nearly There program?
- I think he is.

20:13.262 --> 20:17.028
Terrence Meyers. Baby, isn't he
the guy dating a Bay City Kitty?

20:17.833 --> 20:19.562
Remember?
We were joking about it.

20:19.735 --> 20:22.329
Really? Bay City Kitty.
You mean the cheerleaders.

20:22.504 --> 20:24.563
You happen to remember her name?

20:25.507 --> 20:27.407
No, I don't.

20:28.543 --> 20:32.775
- Can I get you boys anything else?
- We're good. Thank you so much, honey.

20:33.248 --> 20:34.943
That's my angel. I love her.

20:36.151 --> 20:40.247
A second ago you mentioned
the Nearly There Foundation. What is that?

20:40.956 --> 20:44.687
That's a program that we set up
to help ex-cons get back on their feet.

20:44.860 --> 20:48.227
Their parole requires them to have a job.
The Catch-22...

20:48.397 --> 20:51.093
...is not that many people
are excited to hire a felon.

20:51.266 --> 20:53.666
Those poor ex-cons,
they can't catch a break.

20:53.835 --> 20:56.360
No, it's a vicious cycle
they get caught up in.

20:56.538 --> 21:00.941
- Did you see the article in <i>The New Times</i> ?
- Bet your ass I did. I love that writer.

21:01.109 --> 21:05.136
But I'd be lying if I didn't say that we
get some pretty good tax breaks too.

21:05.314 --> 21:06.576
There it is, the kicker.

21:06.748 --> 21:09.046
- Just a perk.
- This sly dog here.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.214
- What do you got?
- Tickets to our annual fundraiser.

21:12.387 --> 21:15.015
- Be my guests.
- No, we can't accept gratuities.

21:15.190 --> 21:16.680
It's against policy.

21:16.858 --> 21:21.124
These don't look like gratuities, they look
like tickets. I'd be happy to accept.

21:21.563 --> 21:24.498
Hey, what about Terrence?
Is he in some kind of trouble?

21:24.900 --> 21:27.869
He's dead. His body washed up
in the marina this morning.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.264
Oh, no.

21:29.805 --> 21:33.434
"Punched his last ticket," as they say.

21:33.875 --> 21:38.710
You know, you try to do all you can for
these guys, but it's just never enough, is it?

21:38.880 --> 21:40.108
No, I guess it isn't.

21:40.282 --> 21:43.410
- When was the last time you saw him?
- The last place I saw...

21:44.019 --> 21:45.577
This is a nice boat.

21:45.754 --> 21:48.985
- Reese, is this yours?
- Actually, that's a yacht.

21:49.157 --> 21:51.148
- I'm sorry, a yacht.
- Excuse me, Hutch.

21:51.326 --> 21:53.726
Can we please focus
on the investigation?

21:53.895 --> 21:55.089
- Sure.
- Thank you.

21:55.998 --> 21:57.727
I could use another one of these.

22:27.696 --> 22:30.790
Right on! That was great, girls!
Take five!

22:32.467 --> 22:35.197
- Let's go.
- Look alive. Here they come.

22:35.504 --> 22:39.338
We usually don't allow spectators.
Even cute ones.

22:40.308 --> 22:43.300
David Starsky, Bay City P.D.
My partner, Ken Hutchinson.

22:43.545 --> 22:46.070
- Girls.
- They're so cute.

22:46.515 --> 22:48.574
I'm Stacey. That's Holly.

22:48.750 --> 22:51.378
God, I loved your moves out there.
Fantastic.

22:51.987 --> 22:54.353
I've never dated a cop before.

22:54.523 --> 22:57.014
My horoscope said I should
try new things today.

22:57.192 --> 22:59.752
- Is that right?
- You're awful.

22:59.928 --> 23:03.762
So, what brings you around here,
officers?

23:04.032 --> 23:06.227
Well, you know, that depends.

23:06.401 --> 23:09.393
Yeah. Either of you two know
a Terrence Meyers?

23:10.072 --> 23:12.438
- Oh, yeah, Heather dated him.
- Oh, yeah.

23:12.607 --> 23:16.941
The girl over there with the yellow top.
But they split up. We haven't seen him.

23:17.112 --> 23:19.637
- Let's go ask Heather some questions.
- Thank you.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.545
Be careful with those moves.
You could hurt someone.

23:22.717 --> 23:24.241
Oh, that's why we practice.

23:25.220 --> 23:27.552
Actually, I was talking about us.

23:30.492 --> 23:31.959
Where did that come from?

23:32.127 --> 23:34.994
- I would've tried the horoscope line.
- No, too obvious.

23:35.163 --> 23:36.391
Hey!

23:36.565 --> 23:38.692
- Wait up.
- See what I mean?

23:40.635 --> 23:44.594
- Here's my number.
- In case you need us for...

23:45.073 --> 23:46.506
...questioning.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.006
Thank you, ladies.

23:48.176 --> 23:49.905
- Bye.
- Bye.

23:50.278 --> 23:53.543
He was always fascinated
by all that macho mobster bullshit.

23:53.782 --> 23:56.216
I hope this is okay.
I need to make this quick.

23:56.384 --> 23:59.410
- I gotta pick my kid up in 20 minutes.
- Oh, yeah, totally.

23:59.588 --> 24:02.523
We were gonna move in together.
He promised he'd quit...

24:02.691 --> 24:04.420
...that stuff after he got out.

24:04.593 --> 24:08.120
But then he goes and gets himself killed.
He's such an asshole.

24:09.564 --> 24:14.126
I can only imagine what you must
be going through. I think that...

24:14.503 --> 24:18.735
Honestly, you know, if I knew what
he was up to, I'd be happy to tell you.

24:18.907 --> 24:21.341
But we didn't talk much.

24:22.110 --> 24:25.273
Yeah. So did you...?

24:26.281 --> 24:28.408
When did he...? Did he...?
What did...?

24:29.751 --> 24:35.314
- So Hutch, do you got any more questions?
- Yeah, well, sure. We could...

24:35.490 --> 24:37.481
What's your sign?

24:38.493 --> 24:40.290
Gemini.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.697
What...

24:43.365 --> 24:46.596
- What do you weigh?
- What does that have to do with anything?

24:46.768 --> 24:50.966
It has everything to do with anything.
Just answer the question, please, ma'am.

24:54.075 --> 24:59.069
Around 115, I guess,
give or take a pound or two.

24:59.714 --> 25:03.206
- I wish I could be more helpful.
- Stop.

25:03.385 --> 25:08.550
Don't do that. You've been great. I mean,
it's terrific. We got what we needed.

25:08.990 --> 25:10.981
Anything else?

25:12.494 --> 25:14.928
- I'm good.
- Yeah.

25:15.096 --> 25:17.394
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

25:17.566 --> 25:21.798
Oh, wait. I don't know if this
will be of any help. It's his.

25:21.970 --> 25:24.438
Take it. I don't want it.

25:26.641 --> 25:29.974
Okay. Thank you. Again.

25:34.349 --> 25:38.615
- Things getting any better at work, Hutch?
- Actually, work was pretty good today.

25:38.787 --> 25:41.051
- How about you? Anything new?
- Nope.

25:41.223 --> 25:43.885
You get a chance to ask that girl out?

25:44.159 --> 25:46.684
I want you to meet
my new partner, David Starsky.

25:46.861 --> 25:48.089
Nice to meet you.

25:48.430 --> 25:50.864
Is this the dickweed
you were telling me about?

25:52.634 --> 25:55.262
Look, just shake his hand.
Come on.

25:55.470 --> 25:58.439
Go on, hop in. Willis.

25:58.607 --> 26:01.132
- Dickweed?
- His mom works late on Wednesdays...

26:01.309 --> 26:03.106
...so I kind of look after him.

26:03.278 --> 26:07.806
- You take a kid out on patrol with you?
- Yeah, that's what we do, isn't it, Willis?

26:07.983 --> 26:11.612
- Patrol!
- Whatever you say, Hutch.

26:12.921 --> 26:14.411
Damn!

26:21.463 --> 26:25.194
- Man, this thing is bad!
- Don't encourage him.

26:29.471 --> 26:31.666
Oh, shit.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.933
Starsky, this your ride?

26:34.576 --> 26:38.774
Damn. You just moved up
a notch in my book.

26:38.947 --> 26:40.608
That puts you at notch one.

26:41.916 --> 26:45.750
- I like your Lincoln.
- It's a '76. It won't be out till next year.

26:45.920 --> 26:48.889
I know people that know people
that robbed some people.

26:50.425 --> 26:52.825
So, what do you hear
on the street these days?

26:53.194 --> 26:58.860
Dig this. A little bird tells me there's
gonna be a big coke deal in Bay City.

26:59.034 --> 27:03.061
- One for the <i>Guinness Books</i>, so they say.
- Interesting.

27:03.238 --> 27:07.436
- Who would this little bird be?
- Look, I lay it out for y'all to play it out.

27:08.176 --> 27:10.644
All right. What does that mean?

27:11.246 --> 27:14.613
- Don't worry about it.
- Huggy, what can you tell us about this?

27:19.788 --> 27:22.222
This looks like the work of Big Earl.

27:22.390 --> 27:25.985
This boy loves dragons.
He makes these with his hands, you know?

27:26.561 --> 27:29.962
There's his name stitched right up
under the dragon's belly.

27:30.131 --> 27:34.033
- Big Earl?
- Yeah, he sews, but he's one tough mother.

27:34.202 --> 27:37.171
He owns a biker bar about
80 miles east of Route 4.

27:37.672 --> 27:40.470
Biker bar?
What goes on down there?

27:40.942 --> 27:43.376
I don't know. Listen to Jim Croce...

27:43.545 --> 27:46.639
...play darts, whatever the hell else
you white people do.

27:46.815 --> 27:50.273
Look, fuzz, I gots to buzz.
This meeting is adjourned.

27:51.252 --> 27:52.776
- That's it?
- That's it.

27:52.954 --> 27:57.482
- He lays it out for us to play it out.
- Oh, and by the way, this little meeting?

27:57.659 --> 28:00.025
- It never happened.
- What meeting?

28:00.195 --> 28:01.958
<i>C'est la vie</i>, gentlemen.

28:07.635 --> 28:09.865
- Great new technique
where you press hard.

28:10.038 --> 28:12.302
- Hands. What, it's a verbal technique?
- No.

28:12.474 --> 28:14.533
Keep your hands on me, I'm teasing.

28:15.310 --> 28:17.574
- What do you got on those cops?
- Everything.

28:17.746 --> 28:20.806
- Records, home addresses, credit history.
- Nice.

28:21.816 --> 28:25.377
- Starsky and Hutchinson?
- They call him Hutch, actually.

28:26.254 --> 28:28.415
I don't have enough
on my plate already?

28:28.590 --> 28:32.822
I got a major coke deal, my daughter's
bat mitzvah, which is a total nightmare.

28:32.994 --> 28:35.861
- And now these two guys.
- You think they're on to us?

28:36.698 --> 28:40.725
They are investigating a murder. That's
what cops do. It's why we pay taxes.

28:40.902 --> 28:44.201
You're the worst. You kidding?
Will you look at these two guys?

28:44.372 --> 28:47.500
He's cute, the blond.

28:47.675 --> 28:48.903
But I like dark hair.

28:49.077 --> 28:51.307
Maybe we ought to push
this whole thing.

28:51.479 --> 28:54.971
- Till things cool off?
- Kevin, please, with the worry.

28:55.150 --> 28:58.381
We're moving ahead as scheduled.
I'll handle those two clowns.

29:00.455 --> 29:04.186
So tomorrow, I say we check out
this biker bar, do a little deep cover.

29:04.359 --> 29:06.452
Sounds good.

29:07.095 --> 29:08.995
Who does your wig work?

29:09.264 --> 29:11.129
- I'm sorry, my what?
- Your wig work.

29:11.299 --> 29:13.267
Your undercover work, your disguises.

29:13.435 --> 29:16.268
- You have a wig guy?
- Oh, yeah, he's incredible.

29:16.438 --> 29:19.100
Well, if it isn't Sonny and Cher.

29:19.741 --> 29:22.403
- Sonny and Cher.
- Sit on it, Manetti.

29:22.677 --> 29:24.736
- Me sit on it?
- Yeah, you, sit on it.

29:24.913 --> 29:27.939
Why don't you sit on it, Starsky,
how's that sound?

29:28.216 --> 29:30.707
You wish.
Because I'm never sitting on it, ever.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.214
That's not what I heard.

29:35.790 --> 29:37.280
- Starsky!
- Come on. Come on!

29:37.459 --> 29:39.086
- Jesus!
- Stop it!

29:41.062 --> 29:45.089
What the hell is going on?
Cool your jets, Starsky!

29:45.667 --> 29:47.396
Everybody, back off!

29:48.236 --> 29:49.464
Including you, Manetti.

29:50.705 --> 29:53.105
I apologize, captain.
You're absolutely right.

29:53.308 --> 29:56.766
You know, you're not even worth it,
Starsky. And for the record...

29:56.945 --> 30:00.176
...those are hand towels.
The big towels are on the top shelf.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.813
Hand towels. What a rod.

30:04.819 --> 30:09.847
Jesus Christ. He's right.
Go cover up.

31:20.495 --> 31:22.053
Who are you guys?

31:23.264 --> 31:27.030
My name's Kansas.
And this is my little man Toto.

31:27.769 --> 31:32.069
We're Jesters from up in Big Cliff, coming
down and check out your place. This it?

31:32.240 --> 31:33.707
Is this your place?

31:33.875 --> 31:36.366
- Yeah.
- Nice.

31:36.544 --> 31:40.412
Tell me, if you two are Jesters,
what's our credo?

31:40.582 --> 31:42.379
Credo.

31:42.550 --> 31:44.040
Well...

31:44.218 --> 31:47.346
You almost got me there.
There's no credo.

31:49.257 --> 31:51.282
Other than the secret credo.

31:52.060 --> 31:55.393
It ain't no secret.
It's written right on our damn crest.

31:55.630 --> 31:59.623
A trick question? If it's printed on
the crest, you don't give it as a test.

31:59.801 --> 32:03.567
Anybody can read the crest. That wouldn't
prove we're Jesters. Not cool.

32:03.738 --> 32:06.935
- That's a fake mustache.
- Oh, really?

32:07.108 --> 32:12.307
Well, I wonder if you
think this is fake.

32:12.480 --> 32:16.314
- Now, we got some questions!
- I don't gotta give you nothing, cop!

32:17.352 --> 32:21.083
Wrong! First, you've gotta
give me a little respect.

32:21.255 --> 32:25.055
Second, you're gonna give me some
answers, <i>comprende, muchacho</i> ?

32:35.269 --> 32:37.760
- I like your style.
- I like your moves.

32:37.939 --> 32:39.167
Now, where were we?

32:39.440 --> 32:41.772
You were gonna tell us
about Terrence Meyers.

32:42.343 --> 32:44.436
Who's Terrence Meyers?

32:44.612 --> 32:48.378
- Wrong answer, Big Earl.
- Big Earl? I'm not Big Earl.

32:48.549 --> 32:51.882
- I'm Jeff.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

32:52.053 --> 32:54.044
- Jeff?
- No one's who they say they are.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.450
Look.

32:55.623 --> 32:58.114
Honest, think about it.
I'm not even big.

33:00.028 --> 33:03.293
Yeah. No, that's a good point.

33:03.464 --> 33:07.594
Maybe it's an ironic name, like
Tiny over in Vice. He's, like, 8 feet tall.

33:07.769 --> 33:11.261
- Everybody says he's tiny...
- I know, except this guy's normal size.

33:11.439 --> 33:14.738
He'd have to be a lot smaller
for a name like Big Earl to be ironic.

33:14.909 --> 33:17.571
You don't have to be a midget.
You're not exactly...

33:17.745 --> 33:19.940
- How tall are you?
- I don't know, 5'9"?

33:20.415 --> 33:23.714
- Well, that is kind of... Basically...
- Borderline. It's average.

33:23.885 --> 33:27.787
Look. Big Earl got pinched two weeks ago.
He's in Bay City Correctional.

33:27.955 --> 33:30.048
I took over the bar till he gets out.

33:30.224 --> 33:33.284
Jeff, I'm sorry.
We apologize.

33:33.461 --> 33:35.361
We're gonna pay Big Earl a visit.

33:35.530 --> 33:38.192
Let me get this for you.
There you go. Good as new.

33:38.366 --> 33:41.062
A word of advice:
Next time you watch a place...

33:41.235 --> 33:43.726
...don't claim you own it
because you watch it.

33:43.905 --> 33:48.569
I housesit for my sister all the time,
it's not like I claim that I own her house.

33:48.910 --> 33:51.174
That goes for all y'all.

33:51.345 --> 33:53.506
Don't pretend to be
something you're not.

33:53.881 --> 33:55.314
Just be who you are.

33:55.917 --> 33:58.511
That's what's really cool.

34:28.315 --> 34:30.580
How did you get in?
Visiting hours are over.

34:31.853 --> 34:33.252
Special treatment.

34:33.420 --> 34:36.652
We got some questions
about Terrence Meyers.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.587
- Terrence Meyers?
- Yeah.

34:38.760 --> 34:40.387
You made this jacket for him?

34:41.329 --> 34:44.764
Gee whiz, I don't seem to know anyone
by that name at all.

34:45.132 --> 34:47.362
Hard customer.

34:47.802 --> 34:50.134
Offer him a radio or some bullshit.

34:50.505 --> 34:53.406
Maybe we can make your stay
a little more comfortable.

34:53.574 --> 34:57.374
- Nice transistor radio for your cell?
- No.

34:57.545 --> 35:00.912
- How about a TV?
- I tell you what.

35:01.082 --> 35:03.880
I do like your blonde friend, here.

35:04.919 --> 35:07.114
Let me see your bellybutton.

35:08.189 --> 35:10.657
No. What... Let's go. Come on.

35:10.825 --> 35:12.486
- No, listen.
- No, no! I'm not...

35:12.660 --> 35:14.287
Hold on.
He's obviously a freak.

35:14.462 --> 35:17.226
Just show him a little skin.
Show him your stomach.

35:17.398 --> 35:18.797
Nobody's here.
Come on.

35:19.066 --> 35:21.159
- Are we cool?
- Yes, we're cool.

35:26.274 --> 35:30.404
Oh, eureka.
God, that's nice.

35:30.578 --> 35:33.479
It's like a little bowl of oatmeal
with a hole in it.

35:33.648 --> 35:35.639
- I got one too.
- Oh, come on.

35:35.850 --> 35:38.785
I just got a little more
brown sugar on mine.

35:39.020 --> 35:41.750
Did you say "Terrence Meyers"?

35:42.123 --> 35:46.184
Yeah, I think I did make that jacket.
We might have pulled a job together.

35:46.360 --> 35:49.193
What job? Who were you working for?

35:49.797 --> 35:52.357
Stand up. Walk to the back
and do a spin for me.

35:52.533 --> 35:55.001
Wait a second.
I just showed you my stomach...

35:55.303 --> 35:56.964
Come on, a deal's a deal, Earl.

35:57.138 --> 36:01.074
Fine, then this conversation is over.

36:02.076 --> 36:03.543
Wait. Wait.

36:03.711 --> 36:05.975
- Hold it. Come on. Wait.
- <i>I can't hear you.</i>

36:11.185 --> 36:12.880
Get up.

36:14.622 --> 36:18.058
- Tell him to take his jacket off.
- Take your jacket off.

36:19.026 --> 36:22.860
- Slow spin.
- He says to do a slow spin.

36:23.164 --> 36:27.032
Tell him to arch his back
and then look back at me, mean.

36:27.201 --> 36:28.498
Like a dragon.

36:31.405 --> 36:35.865
He says to arch your back
and look back at him, mean, like a dragon.

36:36.043 --> 36:38.136
But keep it mean.

36:55.062 --> 36:57.223
Tell him great job.
He can sit down.

36:57.665 --> 37:01.533
You're a very convincing dragon.
You should feel good about that.

37:01.702 --> 37:04.193
Just get this over with.

37:04.405 --> 37:06.066
Okay, here's the deal.

37:06.240 --> 37:09.869
Terrence and I worked as extra muscle
for a couple of dealers.

37:10.044 --> 37:12.274
I'd like to tell you who,
but I don't know.

37:12.446 --> 37:14.710
I never got a name,
I never got a face.

37:14.882 --> 37:16.281
But I do know one thing:

37:19.687 --> 37:22.656
They paid us in coke.
I was pretty pissed at the time.

37:22.823 --> 37:25.155
I was hoping to get cash.
I'm no coke dealer.

37:25.326 --> 37:27.123
Right, so where's the coke?

37:27.295 --> 37:29.729
If we find that coke,
we can probably trace it.

37:29.897 --> 37:32.866
Fine. Fine.

37:33.034 --> 37:35.264
Look, I like you guys, okay?

37:35.436 --> 37:38.428
Especially you. Okay?
Don't feel bad about that.

37:38.606 --> 37:40.597
But I like you guys, so I'll tell you.

37:40.975 --> 37:42.499
But...

37:42.677 --> 37:46.135
But first I need to see something, okay?

37:47.148 --> 37:49.116
And it's gonna involve both of you.

37:49.283 --> 37:51.183
I'm not gonna lie to you.

37:51.352 --> 37:53.217
It's gonna get weird.

37:53.921 --> 37:56.048
Two dragons.

38:00.494 --> 38:04.089
Ready? Both of you, take your shirts off.

38:04.265 --> 38:05.892
But do it slow.

38:24.151 --> 38:27.052
I guess it's supposed
to rain later tonight.

38:27.221 --> 38:29.519
Yeah, that's what I heard.

38:31.492 --> 38:35.428
- Look, you know, what happened...
- Can we please not talk about this, Hutch?

38:35.596 --> 38:38.121
We got the coke.
Let's not ever talk about it.

38:38.699 --> 38:41.327
You're right.
That's a good policy.

38:42.203 --> 38:44.603
We got what we came for.

38:46.907 --> 38:50.365
- You think dragons ever...
- Stop, I don't want to talk about it!

39:06.360 --> 39:09.295
What the hell is wrong with you two?

39:10.664 --> 39:13.497
- Come on, what are you...?
- You have brought disgrace...

39:13.667 --> 39:15.931
...on everyone who's
ever worn a uniform.

39:16.103 --> 39:18.071
My God.

39:18.239 --> 39:21.174
- We didn't know there was a camera.
- Cap, we're sorry.

39:21.342 --> 39:22.741
At least we got the stash.

39:22.910 --> 39:25.504
There's gotta be 30 grams
of coke here, minimum.

39:25.679 --> 39:28.807
This could lead us to the dealers
that iced Terrence Meyers.

39:28.983 --> 39:31.781
It's evidence.
We can print the bag, run forensics.

39:31.952 --> 39:34.944
We did.
We got nothing.

39:35.122 --> 39:40.025
What we got is a bag
of artificial sweetener.

39:40.294 --> 39:42.455
What are you talking about?

39:42.630 --> 39:44.621
My granny wouldn't think
this was coke.

39:44.799 --> 39:48.428
Come on, that's impossible.
We got the stuff from Big Earl.

39:48.602 --> 39:51.002
- I'm taking you two off this floater.
- What?

39:51.539 --> 39:54.770
- I'm giving it to Manetti.
- Manetti? Oh, come on, cap!

39:54.942 --> 39:58.309
- Manetti's the worst cop on the force!
- Starsky. Stop.

39:58.479 --> 40:02.006
Go on, sit down.
Come on.

40:03.717 --> 40:08.381
Look, captain, we're sorry, but come on.
You can't take us off this.

40:08.556 --> 40:11.024
I just did. Now, leave.

40:14.826 --> 40:18.125
And take your bag
of artificial sweetener with you.

40:20.398 --> 40:23.925
- Kicking the chair was a nice touch.
- Yeah, too bad it didn't work.

40:24.101 --> 40:25.568
He'll get over it.

40:25.736 --> 40:29.035
What I can't figure out is why Earl
got paid with bunk cocaine.

40:29.207 --> 40:30.697
Now we've got two leads.

40:30.875 --> 40:33.400
- We do?
- Stacey and Holly.

40:33.578 --> 40:36.706
- Those two cheerleaders?
- No, no, those two witnesses.

40:36.881 --> 40:38.143
They met Terrence.

40:39.383 --> 40:41.943
Let's take them out,
see what we can learn.

40:42.119 --> 40:46.556
I mean, is it our fault that they also
happen to be a couple of hot foxes?

40:47.091 --> 40:49.582
Reese, I couldn't help myself.
They were cops.

40:49.760 --> 40:52.228
- They were just too macho.
- <i>Macho?</i>

40:52.563 --> 40:55.760
- <i>It's simple. You should have lied.</i>
- I did. I lied about you.

40:55.933 --> 40:57.696
I didn't tell them anything.

40:57.869 --> 41:00.599
But I had to give them something.
They were so pure.

41:00.771 --> 41:03.672
You're lucky you're in the joint.
Do you understand me?

41:04.075 --> 41:06.202
- Look at the bright side.
- <i>Bright side?</i>

41:06.377 --> 41:09.437
It's the ultimate test.
The coke was in the police station.

41:09.614 --> 41:11.912
They cleared it.
You should be happy.

41:12.083 --> 41:14.517
Well, guess what?
I'm not happy.

41:14.685 --> 41:16.812
I'm not happy at all about it, Earl!

41:16.988 --> 41:19.684
Don't shush me!
Don't tell me to calm down!

41:19.857 --> 41:22.018
- Understand?
- What are you wearing? Quick.

41:22.193 --> 41:23.660
What am I wearing?

41:23.828 --> 41:26.991
Silk flowered shirt and a vest. Why?

41:27.265 --> 41:28.926
<i>That's gorgeous.</i>

41:29.100 --> 41:33.161
- You sick son of a bitch.
- Don't hang up. Don't hang up!

41:35.940 --> 41:38.568
God. Some people.

41:39.944 --> 41:42.640
I'm not gonna be able
to fit in my uniform tomorrow.

41:42.813 --> 41:44.280
Is that a good or bad thing?

41:46.150 --> 41:48.710
Is this the way you two
always treat witnesses?

41:48.886 --> 41:53.380
Well, that depends. If it's a misdemeanor,
we've been known to skip the fondue...

41:53.557 --> 41:56.424
...and move right to foot massages.
Let me see.

41:56.594 --> 41:59.825
Watch out! Wait a minute,
I think that's police brutality.

41:59.997 --> 42:02.932
- Anybody for some coffee?
- No, thanks.

42:03.100 --> 42:05.500
Okay, one for <i>le chef.</i>

42:06.904 --> 42:09.737
Wow. This place is great.

42:15.546 --> 42:17.514
It serves my needs.
It's cozy. Homey.

42:17.682 --> 42:20.048
- Can you help me find the sugar?
- It's there.

42:20.217 --> 42:22.412
Hutch, help me find the sugar.

42:24.221 --> 42:26.712
- Okay. Pardon me.
- Okay.

42:26.924 --> 42:28.448
- How we doing?
- Great.

42:28.626 --> 42:30.787
- Your fondue put us over the top.
- Really?

42:30.962 --> 42:33.658
Which one do you like?
We're gonna stick to this.

42:33.831 --> 42:36.391
- I have a thing for blondes.
- Good. I'll take anything.

42:37.034 --> 42:38.695
They're sweet little angels.

42:39.136 --> 42:41.627
In two minutes,
I want you to grab my guitar...

42:41.806 --> 42:44.502
...bring it to me,
put it in my hands and step back.

42:44.675 --> 42:47.508
- You play?
- Just bring me the guitar.

42:47.678 --> 42:50.476
Wait. Hey, hey, where's the sugar?

42:50.681 --> 42:52.706
I don't think I have any.

42:53.050 --> 42:55.109
- That's great. He's a cop.
- Come here.

42:55.286 --> 42:57.015
- Both of you.
- You're so funny.

42:57.188 --> 42:59.486
It's like a magpie convention in here.

42:59.657 --> 43:02.125
Let's get the cup out.

43:06.063 --> 43:08.258
Thank you, Big Earl.

43:09.633 --> 43:13.899
Do you ever get scared out there,
on the streets?

43:14.071 --> 43:18.770
Yeah. I'd like to say no,
but the truth is, I do sometimes.

43:20.044 --> 43:24.105
I'm one of those guys that's more about
helping others than helping myself.

43:24.281 --> 43:27.045
- There we go.
- It's all I knew.

43:27.218 --> 43:30.278
It's more that there's someone
I might not be able to help.

43:30.454 --> 43:34.914
A citizen that needs aid,
or even an animal.

43:35.092 --> 43:37.652
- Look what I found.
- Put that away. Put it away!

43:37.828 --> 43:40.797
Hutch, you gotta play.
Come on. Play, play. Please.

43:40.965 --> 43:43.126
Don't you wanna play?
Come on. Hutch!

43:43.768 --> 43:45.736
All right. Holly, turn off the music.

43:45.903 --> 43:47.268
- Now, come on!
- Oh, sorry.

43:47.438 --> 43:49.372
Look alive. Let's go.

43:49.607 --> 43:53.134
- Hutch is gonna play.
- What have you gotten me into, Starsky?

43:53.310 --> 43:57.144
- Thought we were partners.
- Come on, Hutch!

43:59.050 --> 44:01.746
One, two, three.

45:01.745 --> 45:03.975
- That was great, Hutch!
- Come on, you guys.

45:04.148 --> 45:07.379
It was just a guy here with a guitar,
singing his heart out.

45:08.986 --> 45:10.954
Starsky's bored.

45:12.590 --> 45:14.490
- Anybody else bored?
- What?

45:14.658 --> 45:16.592
- A club could be fun.
- Club. Yeah.

45:16.760 --> 45:19.490
Okay, I'll get some more coffee
and then we'll go.

45:19.830 --> 45:21.024
Is he okay?

45:49.093 --> 45:50.720
Isn't this place great?

45:50.895 --> 45:52.453
Do you like places like this?

45:52.630 --> 45:55.326
You're a cheerleader,
so you're dancing in formation.

45:55.499 --> 45:58.593
This place can't be fun,
because it's like you're at work.

45:58.769 --> 46:00.999
Are you okay?
You seem kind of wound up.

46:01.172 --> 46:03.538
Wound up?
No, I'm just pumped. I'm excited.

46:03.707 --> 46:07.609
Rock-solid, ready to go. A little bit
paranoid, but feeling really good.

46:07.778 --> 46:10.338
- Can I kiss you?
- Okay.

46:12.383 --> 46:14.112
- Watch it, man.
- Excuse me?

46:14.418 --> 46:17.819
I said, watch it. Floor's for dancing.
You can tell by the lights.

46:18.022 --> 46:19.990
- Wanna tangle, curly?
- Come on. No.

46:20.157 --> 46:22.091
- No, we're gonna dance.
- No, no, no.

46:22.259 --> 46:24.557
Curly wants to tangle.

46:24.895 --> 46:28.262
- Do you really want a piece of this?
- I don't want a piece.

46:28.966 --> 46:31.434
I want the whole thing.

46:32.937 --> 46:34.461
Yeah!

46:34.638 --> 46:37.334
- Oh, my, folks!
- Please don't do this.

46:37.508 --> 46:39.840
- Don't worry. I can take him.
- It's not that.

46:40.010 --> 46:42.478
You shouldn't do this
because it's so lame.

46:42.646 --> 46:45.376
Tonight, our own Dancing Rick
is being called out...

46:45.549 --> 46:48.950
...by new guy David Stamsky.
- No, no, Starsky.

46:49.119 --> 46:51.917
Back at you.
If you've got a pair of sunglasses...

46:52.089 --> 46:57.550
...l'd put them on, because I got a feeling
these two are gonna light it up!

46:58.295 --> 47:00.889
Boz, reel it in!

47:03.100 --> 47:05.625
All right, settle down.
Everybody settle.

47:05.803 --> 47:08.567
You know the rules.
Keep it safe, keep it sexy...

47:08.739 --> 47:12.004
...and above all, turn up the night!

47:14.945 --> 47:16.936
Dancing Rick getting warmed up here.

47:17.114 --> 47:19.776
What's he gonna bring out
for the appetizer course?

47:19.950 --> 47:24.649
Oh, it's a little hand-over-hand tuggle, man,
right into the center of the floor.

47:27.391 --> 47:28.881
That's all he's giving him.

47:29.059 --> 47:30.993
That's a bucketful of confidence.

47:31.161 --> 47:34.426
Over to new guy David Starsky.

47:35.633 --> 47:38.363
This guy could be trouble.

47:39.203 --> 47:43.299
It's the Wild West.
Those are six-guns full of sexy.

47:43.474 --> 47:47.410
The good, the bad and the groovy.

47:47.578 --> 47:50.547
One, two, three, four,
we've got disco war, folks.

47:53.050 --> 47:56.816
Dancing Rick's going, "I don't like you,
but I respect your moves."

47:56.987 --> 47:59.615
Here comes Starsky again.

47:59.790 --> 48:04.227
Driving that disco big rig.
Shift gears, blow your funky horn.

48:04.395 --> 48:08.422
Pull into the truck stop and get yourself
some scrapple made out of sexy.

48:09.733 --> 48:13.499
Disco Rick brings it right back
and he's not wasting any time, folks.

48:13.671 --> 48:17.698
From the future of 1984,
that's a funky disco robot.

48:18.709 --> 48:22.406
They're both on the floor, folks,
eye to eye. It's disco Vietnam.

48:22.579 --> 48:24.774
Neither one's blinking or backing down.

48:24.948 --> 48:26.347
Let's see what happens.

48:26.850 --> 48:29.785
Angry cat.
Kitten has claws.

48:29.953 --> 48:33.218
All right, looks like it's over.
Remember, $2 Harvey Wall...

48:33.390 --> 48:36.882
Oh, my God!
David Starsky, taking it over the line!

48:45.936 --> 48:48.370
How about that?
Very sexy, very macho.

48:48.539 --> 48:50.598
But that's a little too close to call.

48:50.774 --> 48:54.540
We'll have to depend on our patented
American Lights Applause-O-Meter.

48:54.712 --> 48:58.910
So let's bring out our combatants, folks.
Come on, big hand for them.

48:59.416 --> 49:01.509
Here we go.

49:01.852 --> 49:06.346
First off, over to my man,
Dancing Rick.

49:08.125 --> 49:12.118
And over to the new guy,
David Starsky.

49:13.597 --> 49:15.895
Folks, pretty close.
I hate to do this...

49:16.066 --> 49:18.762
...but I gotta give it to my man
Dancing Rick.

49:18.936 --> 49:20.836
<i>Boo! Boo!</i>

49:21.004 --> 49:23.734
What? Hey, hey, do it again!
That's B.S.

49:23.907 --> 49:26.137
- What?
- I won. Do the applause thing again!

49:26.310 --> 49:28.107
It was just for fun. Forget it...

49:28.278 --> 49:30.712
- I said, do it again, liar!
- Not cool, not cool!

49:30.881 --> 49:33.247
- Liar! Do it again!
- All right.

49:33.417 --> 49:36.318
Hey, hey, settle down.
Settle down.

49:36.487 --> 49:38.421
I'm a cop. It's cool.

49:40.090 --> 49:41.352
It's okay.

49:43.494 --> 49:46.122
It's okay, it's okay!
Calm down, people.

49:46.296 --> 49:49.993
Bay City P.D.
We got him.

49:50.701 --> 49:52.965
We're gonna get you home.

49:53.704 --> 49:55.569
- Where am I?
- You were freaking out.

49:55.739 --> 49:58.640
- I had to take you down.
- What?

50:01.378 --> 50:03.073
There we go.

50:03.247 --> 50:05.545
Easy does it.

50:06.183 --> 50:08.117
Here we go.

50:11.455 --> 50:13.616
I think I was drugged.

50:14.925 --> 50:16.324
Sounds like you did coke.

50:18.562 --> 50:21.463
I mean, from what I've read
about the effects.

50:21.632 --> 50:25.864
I don't use coke.
I had coffee tonight.

50:30.340 --> 50:32.035
- What is that?
- Sweetener, right?

50:32.209 --> 50:34.871
The stuff from Earl?
What are you doing with this?

50:35.045 --> 50:36.706
- Hutch?
- Where'd you get this?

50:37.414 --> 50:40.042
- I beat that guy. What was that about?
- You did.

50:40.217 --> 50:44.415
- You won. You danced your heart out.
- And everybody saw it.

50:44.588 --> 50:45.885
- Sleep.
- I was robbed.

50:46.056 --> 50:49.924
I know. We was robbed.
We was robbed.

50:50.127 --> 50:51.389
Go to sleep.

50:53.730 --> 50:58.292
Go to sleep, tiny dancer. All right.

50:58.602 --> 51:00.229
Jesus Christ.

51:03.540 --> 51:06.202
- Is he okay?
- Oh, yeah, he's okay.

51:06.376 --> 51:08.970
He just needs to sleep it off.

51:09.580 --> 51:11.844
Quite a night, huh?

51:12.149 --> 51:14.447
You can say that again.

51:14.885 --> 51:17.581
Guess it's kind of winding down.

51:17.754 --> 51:21.315
- Well, it doesn't have to be over.
- What do you mean?

51:26.697 --> 51:29.257
Where did that come from?

51:32.903 --> 51:36.270
I just want you to know,
I really like your partner.

51:36.440 --> 51:40.536
- I know, he's such a good guy.
- This is just, like, whatever.

51:40.711 --> 51:44.044
I don't think we even have to judge it.
It's too natural.

51:44.214 --> 51:45.772
- Okay.
- It's just...

51:46.450 --> 51:49.214
You guys wanna kiss? Yeah.

52:03.400 --> 52:07.427
I hear somebody stirring.
There he is.

52:07.938 --> 52:10.133
I feel for you.

52:11.975 --> 52:14.603
Jesus! Please, turn that off!

52:14.778 --> 52:17.770
Easy, killer.
Just a blender.

52:19.383 --> 52:23.649
- What time is it?
- Time for Hutch's hangover cure.

52:23.987 --> 52:27.013
- What's in it?
- Pepto-Bismol, Aunt Jemima mix...

52:27.190 --> 52:29.124
...Tang and a little flat Tab.

52:29.293 --> 52:31.523
Most important thing.

52:32.663 --> 52:34.028
And a raw egg.

52:34.731 --> 52:37.461
Saves lives. Trust me.

52:39.870 --> 52:41.167
And?

52:45.042 --> 52:47.272
- It's good.
- What did I tell you?

52:48.111 --> 52:49.738
Sorry about last night.

52:49.913 --> 52:54.043
- Thanks for taking care of the girls.
- Hey, no problem. Happy to do it.

52:54.217 --> 52:57.675
What are partners for?
Speaking of which...

52:58.488 --> 53:02.948
...I checked this stuff out and even though
it tastes like sugar, that is cocaine.

53:04.328 --> 53:07.058
- You sure?
- I'm sure...

53:07.230 --> 53:10.495
...Stacey's sure, Holly's sure...

53:11.702 --> 53:13.135
How do you like your eggs?

53:13.537 --> 53:17.166
Didn't Huggy mention something
about a coke deal going down?

53:17.341 --> 53:19.775
"One for the Guinness Book,"
was how he put it.

53:19.943 --> 53:21.740
Seems like a big coincidence.

53:21.912 --> 53:23.903
Why don't I drive?
You don't look good.

53:24.081 --> 53:26.777
No. If I'm alive, I drive.

53:26.950 --> 53:28.781
Rhyming already, you must be...

53:36.693 --> 53:37.955
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

53:38.128 --> 53:40.528
He blew out my fricking window!

53:41.498 --> 53:43.989
All right! Enough with the car!
We get it!

53:44.768 --> 53:46.861
Stop shooting my car!

53:47.037 --> 53:49.028
Okay, cover me. Say when.

53:49.206 --> 53:50.833
Go!

53:52.876 --> 53:55.242
Zebra to base,
I want you to run a plate.

53:55.479 --> 53:58.004
Larry, one, apple, nine, eight, four.

53:58.181 --> 54:01.207
Larry, one, apple, nine, eight, four.

54:01.518 --> 54:02.780
- Damn it!
- You okay?

54:02.953 --> 54:06.218
Look at this! This is horrible!

54:06.657 --> 54:09.888
What kind of world do we live in
where somebody does this?

54:10.527 --> 54:13.223
Well, I think he was aiming at us.

54:13.630 --> 54:16.224
Think this is funny?
Seriously, is this funny?

54:16.400 --> 54:20.234
<i>Zebra 3, we have an ID on that plate.</i>
<i>Lee M. Chau, 1325 Western.</i>

54:20.604 --> 54:23.232
- <i>I repeat...</i>
- Ready to dish out a little payback?

54:57.240 --> 54:58.832
Freeze! Bay City P.D.!

55:01.645 --> 55:04.079
- The hell was that?
- I think it's his kid.

55:04.247 --> 55:09.685
All right, just sit tight, little boy.
Well, well, well, this looks familiar.

55:09.853 --> 55:13.084
Possession of cocaine and
attempted murder, huh?

55:13.256 --> 55:14.985
- Jesus!
- What was that?

55:16.126 --> 55:21.291
That ain't a kid! It's a tiny little man!
And he's got knives! Goddamn!

55:21.465 --> 55:23.092
- My arm!
- Oh, shit!

55:25.969 --> 55:30.531
Make him stop! Make him stop!
Tell him to stop! Stop it!

55:36.613 --> 55:39.878
Starsky! Starsky, we need to go now!
Come on!

55:40.050 --> 55:41.847
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

55:45.589 --> 55:48.114
All right, now...

55:48.291 --> 55:53.194
Okay, time out. Let's just take a little break.
I'm gonna get out of here... Jeez!

55:54.765 --> 55:57.199
Oh, mama! What is your problem?

55:57.901 --> 56:00.062
I said, time out!

56:02.172 --> 56:05.005
Hutch! A little help.

56:05.175 --> 56:10.238
He pinned you good, partner.
On three. One, two...

56:11.081 --> 56:13.072
Time to answer some questions,
old man.

56:13.250 --> 56:16.811
Who's the little dwarf you got
throwing knives at me and my partner?

56:16.987 --> 56:19.148
That was no dwarf. That was my son.

56:19.322 --> 56:21.313
Liar!

56:21.725 --> 56:23.886
Come on, you're going downtown.

56:24.060 --> 56:27.120
Let's go, Starsky. On your feet!

56:53.623 --> 56:57.115
Now, you wanna tell me
who hired you?

56:58.295 --> 57:03.130
We have a saying in Koreatown.
It goes, "Kiss my yellow ass, copper!"

57:04.100 --> 57:09.060
All right. You wanna play games?
I got a game for you, Chau.

57:13.076 --> 57:15.408
Let's play a little Russian roulette.

57:17.948 --> 57:20.246
We got a little saying here in Bay City:

57:21.852 --> 57:23.444
"You cross the line...

57:25.455 --> 57:26.717
...your nuts are mine."

57:26.890 --> 57:29.882
There's really a bullet in the gun.

57:30.060 --> 57:33.552
- Yes, I know. That is the point...
- No, you don't understand.

57:33.730 --> 57:35.789
- Let's play!
- The bullet went inside!

57:35.966 --> 57:39.663
Come on, you wanna play,
let's play! Let's play!

57:40.370 --> 57:41.632
- Your turn!
- No!

57:41.805 --> 57:46.640
I thought you wanted to play. Come on,
Chau. You wanna play? Let's play a game!

57:47.010 --> 57:51.140
- What are you doing? Jesus.
- Our little friend here is about to talk.

57:51.314 --> 57:52.542
What in the holy...?

58:03.293 --> 58:07.195
- All right, enough with the talking. Let's go.
- What? No! Starsky, no!

58:11.468 --> 58:15.598
- You're crazy!
- Are you out of your mind?

58:17.073 --> 58:18.904
Calm down.

58:19.075 --> 58:24.206
Calm down? He tried to kill me. He shoot
everything. I have heart attack already.

58:24.414 --> 58:27.144
It's over. It's over.
Just calm down.

58:37.694 --> 58:40.424
- What?
- No, nothing. Nothing. This guy is funny.

58:40.597 --> 58:44.033
- It's not about you.
- That's great. He can be your new partner.

58:44.200 --> 58:46.395
Chau and Hutch. Sounds cool.

58:46.569 --> 58:52.235
Forget it. All right, Chau, what else can
you tell me about the guys that hired you?

58:52.409 --> 58:57.642
Not much. A couple of whiteys.
Nice suit. Perry Ellis.

58:57.814 --> 58:59.975
They pay, I do job.

59:00.150 --> 59:02.516
- What did they look like?
- I don't know.

59:02.686 --> 59:06.053
They were white.
All you guys look alike to me.

59:08.992 --> 59:12.359
That's funny, all you guys
look alike to us. Orientals.

59:13.563 --> 59:15.053
So where'd you meet him?

59:15.231 --> 59:20.533
We met... How do you say? By water.

59:20.704 --> 59:24.765
- At the beach?
- No, no, no. On water.

59:24.941 --> 59:29.401
- Right, a boat. You met on a boat.
- No, no, no. Not a boat.

59:29.946 --> 59:31.379
It's a yacht.

01:00:16.393 --> 01:00:20.261
Rock into womanhood, Elizabeth!
We know that you will.

01:00:21.564 --> 01:00:23.156
- All right.
- What's that mean?

01:00:23.333 --> 01:00:27.326
We have a special delivery for
the little lady. It's right over here.

01:00:27.504 --> 01:00:28.801
Let's see what's inside.

01:00:53.263 --> 01:00:56.528
- These pantomimes suck.
- Don't look at me. I didn't hire them.

01:00:56.699 --> 01:00:59.429
- Well, who did?
- I don't know.

01:01:02.439 --> 01:01:05.340
These pantomimes aren't very good.

01:01:05.809 --> 01:01:08.300
This must be Reese's big surprise.

01:01:08.478 --> 01:01:10.639
Look at me, guys,
I'm a mime too.

01:01:10.814 --> 01:01:13.442
- Everyone's miming something.
- Embarrassing.

01:01:23.026 --> 01:01:24.459
- Reese just left.
- I know.

01:01:24.627 --> 01:01:27.027
- Stay here, I'll follow him.
- I'll follow him.

01:01:27.197 --> 01:01:31.293
No, you stay. Keep them occupied.
You're doing great. They love you.

01:01:41.878 --> 01:01:45.336
I might do the glass wall
one more time.

01:01:46.716 --> 01:01:48.343
Boo!

01:01:48.518 --> 01:01:53.319
Terrific. Tell him you like him, ask him to
sit by you at the cafeteria. How do I know?

01:01:53.490 --> 01:01:58.154
What am I, your counselor? Yeah, I'd like
to get to the information that I need, okay?

01:01:59.762 --> 01:02:01.059
<i>It's done.</i>

01:02:01.397 --> 01:02:07.097
My buddy delivered the package. It's in
your garage. It's locked up nice and tight...

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:10.034
- <i>... in case anybody gets nosy.</i>
- <i>No one saw him?</i>

01:02:10.206 --> 01:02:11.366
<i>Not a soul.</i>

01:02:11.541 --> 01:02:13.236
Now, about my fee...

01:02:13.409 --> 01:02:17.140
You'll be paid as soon as I've
checked it out. If you'll excuse me...

01:02:17.313 --> 01:02:19.713
- Reese, wait.
- What?

01:02:20.583 --> 01:02:23.143
- Mazel tov, man.
- <i>Thanks.</i>

01:02:23.319 --> 01:02:24.581
They grow up so fast.

01:02:24.954 --> 01:02:29.015
- <i>Go play dragon. I gotta go.</i>
- <i>All right. Big kisses.</i>

01:02:30.793 --> 01:02:35.526
Thank you, everybody, for coming out to
celebrate my little girl's bat mitzvah.

01:02:35.698 --> 01:02:39.429
I should say "young woman."
It'll take me a while to get used to that.

01:02:39.602 --> 01:02:42.002
- This guy's good. Sweet.
- It's in his garage.

01:02:42.172 --> 01:02:44.072
- What?
- The cocaine is in his garage.

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.333
- Are you sure?
- We take him down now.

01:02:46.509 --> 01:02:49.307
- Let's go.
- All right, cut the music.

01:02:49.479 --> 01:02:51.071
Cut the music.

01:02:51.247 --> 01:02:54.705
I think I speak for everyone
when I say we're a little mimed out.

01:02:54.884 --> 01:02:56.215
Don't worry. Show's over.

01:02:56.719 --> 01:02:59.654
You're under arrest for possession
with intent to sell.

01:02:59.822 --> 01:03:02.757
- This man's a drug dealer.
- Okay, I think what we have...

01:03:02.926 --> 01:03:05.724
- Maybe you didn't hear us.
- Take it easy, everybody.

01:03:05.895 --> 01:03:08.830
You're making the biggest mistake
of your life, hear me?

01:03:08.998 --> 01:03:11.159
You're the one making
the mistake, pusher.

01:03:12.769 --> 01:03:16.034
Kevin, call my attorney,
please. Ridiculous.

01:03:16.439 --> 01:03:18.839
- Open it.
- My hands are tied.

01:03:19.008 --> 01:03:21.806
Fine. Allow me.

01:03:22.946 --> 01:03:25.813
Let this be a lesson to everyone,
especially you kids.

01:03:25.982 --> 01:03:29.042
Don't be fooled by the first-class suit
and the big house.

01:03:29.219 --> 01:03:32.484
Reese Feldman's nothing more than
a two-bit drug dealer.

01:03:32.655 --> 01:03:34.555
You want some proof?

01:03:35.158 --> 01:03:37.092
Here's some proof.

01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:42.022
This is a bad man.

01:03:42.765 --> 01:03:45.461
And this is what bad men do.

01:03:46.436 --> 01:03:48.597
A pony!

01:03:48.938 --> 01:03:51.202
Happy bat mitzvah, baby. I love you.

01:03:55.245 --> 01:03:57.509
Take the kids in, come on.
Let's go, kids.

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:01.878
It's all right, baby, it's okay. Come here.
Come here. We'll get you a new pony.

01:04:04.187 --> 01:04:07.384
Hey there, little fella. You okay?

01:04:11.294 --> 01:04:16.994
Mr. Feldman, on behalf of the
entire Bay City Police Department...

01:04:17.667 --> 01:04:21.763
...I sincerely apologize.
- That's okay, captain.

01:04:21.938 --> 01:04:25.374
My attorney here would love to
take them down, but I know...

01:04:25.541 --> 01:04:27.338
...that in the bottom
of their hearts...

01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:32.311
...these two detectives were just
trying to protect me and my family.

01:04:32.915 --> 01:04:35.907
I gotcha. Thank you.

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:41.483
I respect your attitude,
but you can be sure...

01:04:41.658 --> 01:04:44.388
...it will never happen again,
because as of now...

01:04:44.727 --> 01:04:47.389
...both of you are suspended indefinitely.

01:04:47.563 --> 01:04:52.330
Look, cap, this was my fault.
Don't drag Hutch into this. I shot the pony.

01:04:52.502 --> 01:04:54.163
You care what happens to Hutch?

01:04:54.337 --> 01:04:58.068
You filed for transfer two weeks ago,
citing his behavior as a reason.

01:04:58.241 --> 01:05:01.176
- Captain...
- Oh yeah, yeah. Check this out.

01:05:01.344 --> 01:05:03.938
Sounds like you're quite
the crime fighter, Hutch.

01:05:04.113 --> 01:05:07.674
- You filed for a transfer?
- Guns and badges, right here, on my desk.

01:05:11.587 --> 01:05:14.112
Your mother would be
very disappointed in you.

01:05:30.273 --> 01:05:33.902
Man, I've really had it with that Doby.
I mean, it's enough already.

01:05:34.077 --> 01:05:39.037
"Cavorting with nefarious characters.
Conduct unbecoming of an officer."

01:05:39.415 --> 01:05:42.748
I wrote that two weeks ago.
Things are really cool with us now.

01:05:42.919 --> 01:05:45.353
- Hey, did you go through my locker?
- No.

01:05:45.521 --> 01:05:48.718
- You went through my locker.
- I might have looked inside...

01:05:48.891 --> 01:05:53.419
If you got a problem with someone, tell it
to their face. You come to them as a man.

01:05:53.596 --> 01:05:58.329
You don't go behind their back and write
a thesis and try to get transferred.

01:06:04.907 --> 01:06:07.137
Backstabber!

01:06:07.377 --> 01:06:10.073
Yeah, don't anybody work
with David Starsky.

01:06:10.246 --> 01:06:12.908
He'll stab you in the back.

01:06:14.317 --> 01:06:17.718
You've got to let this go.
We got lucky. These guys screwed up.

01:06:17.887 --> 01:06:21.084
- They can't even touch us now. It is over.
- I don't care.

01:06:21.257 --> 01:06:25.193
No one dresses as a mime and embarrasses
me at my daughter's bat mitzvah.

01:06:25.528 --> 01:06:26.961
In my own house, no less.

01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:29.462
Have some perspective.
We're almost finished.

01:06:29.632 --> 01:06:33.568
We're a few days from closing
a $35-million deal. Let it slide.

01:06:33.736 --> 01:06:36.864
Yeah, I'll let it slide. When they're dead.

01:06:38.241 --> 01:06:39.606
Why did I get so lucky?

01:06:39.776 --> 01:06:42.836
I don't know, I just love
when you talk so tough.

01:06:43.012 --> 01:06:46.277
Of course you do. That's why
you're my girlfriend on the side.

01:07:17.847 --> 01:07:19.508
Hey, Hutch.

01:08:02.391 --> 01:08:04.552
"Ruin me!"

01:08:09.599 --> 01:08:12.090
Excuse me, let me have
a minute with my friend.

01:08:12.268 --> 01:08:17.228
He didn't care if he got ruined. That was
the whole point of the episode. Did you...?

01:08:17.406 --> 01:08:21.466
Hutch, you gonna have to lay up off
of this juice. You had too much to drink.

01:08:21.644 --> 01:08:27.048
Come on. I feel like a million bucks.
Just laughing, having a good time.

01:08:27.216 --> 01:08:28.808
It ain't even funny no more.

01:08:28.984 --> 01:08:33.421
There used to be a time here when you
peed against the wall, you did it outside.

01:08:36.425 --> 01:08:39.917
Lighten up, it's Friday night.
Okay? It's a bar.

01:08:40.095 --> 01:08:43.189
Hutch, it's Wednesday afternoon, man.
Snap out of it.

01:08:45.301 --> 01:08:48.667
- What time is it?
- It's 5:00, man.

01:08:48.837 --> 01:08:54.140
Shit. I'm supposed to pick up Willis at 3.
Huggy, I'm sorry, we...

01:08:56.479 --> 01:09:00.245
Hutch! Hey, Hutch! You home?

01:09:00.416 --> 01:09:04.477
You were supposed to pick me up
at 3:00 today. What happened?

01:09:05.488 --> 01:09:06.785
Deadbeat.

01:09:27.810 --> 01:09:32.076
<i>If you could have yourself one wish,</i>
<i>what would it be for?</i>

01:09:32.247 --> 01:09:35.546
"Mama put the salt back on a
straight line with the pepper...

01:09:35.718 --> 01:09:39.346
...and got that look like when
she be telling me that old wise stuff.

01:09:39.522 --> 01:09:41.490
She told Nobie he
should wish for..."

01:09:41.924 --> 01:09:46.884
Good friends. <i>Free to Be You and Me</i>.
That's what Mama tells Nobie to wish for.

01:09:47.196 --> 01:09:49.357
- Well, well, well.
- How you doing, Willis?

01:09:49.532 --> 01:09:53.332
- I'm pretty good.
- Yeah? Got you something.

01:09:53.502 --> 01:09:57.131
Damn. A wrist rocket.

01:09:57.306 --> 01:10:02.300
- Watch out with that thing. Very powerful.
- Cool. Thanks, Starsky.

01:10:02.478 --> 01:10:05.743
Pretty sure those are illegal.
Even though you're my friend...

01:10:05.915 --> 01:10:08.008
...might have to report you to Doby.

01:10:10.319 --> 01:10:13.720
All right. Okay, look, Hutch, can we...?

01:10:14.490 --> 01:10:16.685
Is it all right if I talk
to you outside?

01:10:16.859 --> 01:10:19.521
No, I better stay here with the kid.

01:10:19.929 --> 01:10:22.898
All right. Hey, feel better, all right?

01:10:23.065 --> 01:10:24.657
You got it.

01:10:25.868 --> 01:10:30.396
- Can you believe that guy? What a...
- Hutch, the man was trying to apologize.

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:33.465
Dig this, man. Someone once said...

01:10:33.643 --> 01:10:37.511
..."To err is human, to forgive, divine."

01:10:39.682 --> 01:10:41.013
What idiot said that?

01:10:41.183 --> 01:10:45.119
I believe that was God,
the greatest mack of all.

01:10:47.323 --> 01:10:50.190
David. David.

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.159
Yeah.

01:10:53.929 --> 01:10:55.658
Okay, so, what did you wanna say?

01:10:55.831 --> 01:10:59.494
Nothing. Apparently you're too busy
and I'm not worth it. It's fine.

01:10:59.669 --> 01:11:02.137
- Really, it's good.
- Come on, let's hear it.

01:11:02.571 --> 01:11:07.406
There's nothing that... I just was gonna
say that I think you're a good cop.

01:11:07.576 --> 01:11:11.842
- Okay, well, thank you.
- And I am...

01:11:12.014 --> 01:11:16.212
...sorry about what I wrote in the report.

01:11:16.385 --> 01:11:20.287
Yeah, because I'm telling you, I felt like
I'd just gotten my world rocked...

01:11:21.323 --> 01:11:23.120
- Are you crying?
- What's that?

01:11:23.292 --> 01:11:26.750
- Are you crying?
- No, I'm not crying. You're crying.

01:11:26.929 --> 01:11:29.124
It's okay to cry. People cry.

01:11:29.298 --> 01:11:34.895
That's great, but I'm not crying. I'm not a
crier. I don't cry. I work out. I have hobbies.

01:11:35.071 --> 01:11:36.333
- Come here.
- What?

01:11:36.706 --> 01:11:40.005
- Come here. I forgive you, all right?
- Okay.

01:11:40.176 --> 01:11:41.643
I forgive you.

01:11:42.111 --> 01:11:45.603
Okay, that's probably enough.
That's enough.

01:11:45.781 --> 01:11:47.305
- All right?
- Okay.

01:11:47.483 --> 01:11:49.348
- Are we good?
- Yeah, we're good.

01:11:49.518 --> 01:11:52.078
Because we got some people
that want us dead.

01:11:52.254 --> 01:11:56.714
They took a shot at you. They tried to
blow up my house, almost killed little Willis.

01:11:56.892 --> 01:11:59.258
We gotta do... Now what?

01:11:59.428 --> 01:12:02.363
Nothing. I'm just excited.
Let's get these scumbags!

01:12:02.531 --> 01:12:05.432
- Get them! That's what I wanna see.
- Let's get them!

01:12:05.601 --> 01:12:08.502
- Get some tissues. Let's go.
- What are you doing?

01:13:05.528 --> 01:13:09.760
- Damn. I'll tell you that.
- Look, I'm telling you, it's right here.

01:13:09.932 --> 01:13:14.528
Reese is meeting with the biggest drug
dealers in back alleys all over the place.

01:13:14.703 --> 01:13:16.898
But talking isn't illegal.

01:13:17.072 --> 01:13:21.031
Yeah, the guy's not stupid.
He knows how to stay clean.

01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:22.973
Dirty ones always do.

01:13:23.145 --> 01:13:27.673
We gotta find a way to get close to him,
get inside and hear what's going on.

01:13:27.850 --> 01:13:30.614
It's gonna be tough.
The guy knows what we look like.

01:13:30.786 --> 01:13:33.084
He doesn't know what
Huggy Bear looks like.

01:13:35.591 --> 01:13:40.392
Man, this is a bunch of crap.
I am an urban informant. I am not a snitch.

01:13:40.563 --> 01:13:44.294
- Come on, Huggy, what's the difference?
- A snitch wears a wire.

01:13:44.466 --> 01:13:47.333
A snitch is the scum
of the information industry.

01:13:47.503 --> 01:13:50.904
A snitch has no soul.
Damn, man, that shit hurt.

01:13:51.073 --> 01:13:53.371
- I'm sorry.
- You got to be more careful.

01:13:53.542 --> 01:13:56.978
We wouldn't ask you to do this
unless it was really important.

01:13:57.146 --> 01:13:59.478
- I'm gonna owe you one.
- More than one, man.

01:13:59.648 --> 01:14:02.776
Let's slow down with the scorekeeping.
I might remember...

01:14:02.952 --> 01:14:06.945
...stuff I've overlooked over the years,
then mention it to my partner here.

01:14:08.557 --> 01:14:10.252
How'd that be?

01:14:12.094 --> 01:14:16.656
- All right, man, get this over with. Hurry up.
- All right. All right. Good. We're done.

01:14:16.832 --> 01:14:19.630
- All right, let's get that outfit.
- Outfit?

01:14:21.403 --> 01:14:24.770
Oh, no, man. You know Huggy Bear
wouldn't wear that, man.

01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:28.205
Come with something better.
Take that shit back to Florida.

01:14:28.377 --> 01:14:29.844
That ain't me, baby.

01:14:35.751 --> 01:14:38.276
Mr. Casual. So nice of you to join us.

01:14:38.721 --> 01:14:40.882
Sorry about that, sir.

01:14:41.523 --> 01:14:43.423
What would you say this is?

01:14:45.094 --> 01:14:46.584
Golf?

01:14:47.229 --> 01:14:50.027
Real funny, Amos.
Give me the 9-iron.

01:14:56.672 --> 01:14:59.505
- Where the hell's my 9-iron?
- I was gonna bring...

01:14:59.675 --> 01:15:01.643
Let me explain something to you.

01:15:01.810 --> 01:15:04.643
You are in charge
of this area right here.

01:15:05.214 --> 01:15:07.205
Clubs come out.
They gotta go back in.

01:15:07.383 --> 01:15:11.945
I realize this is a complex procedure, but it's
up to you to manage the whole business.

01:15:12.121 --> 01:15:13.383
Do you got that, Nipsey?

01:15:14.189 --> 01:15:15.816
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>I should make you run...</i>

01:15:15.991 --> 01:15:20.189
<i>... back to the driving range and get it.</i>
<i>Just give me the wedge.</i>

01:15:24.934 --> 01:15:27.562
3-wood?
My man gave me a 3-wood.

01:15:28.504 --> 01:15:30.734
<i>Do you even know what</i>
<i>a pitching wedge is?</i>

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:32.999
- <i>Are you even a real caddy?</i>
- Come on.

01:15:33.175 --> 01:15:38.841
Look, man, this grass is
Alabama Creeping Bent...

01:15:39.114 --> 01:15:41.344
<i>... as opposed to Georgia Creeping Bent.</i>

01:15:42.351 --> 01:15:44.046
It's lighter.

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:47.421
- Lighter meaning faster?
- Exactly.

01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:53.087
Hold this.

01:15:58.367 --> 01:16:00.267
Look at that. Good shot.

01:16:05.975 --> 01:16:09.604
- You know a lot about golf.
- I know even more about grass.

01:16:09.778 --> 01:16:11.541
I don't question that.

01:16:11.714 --> 01:16:15.206
- <i>That was a great shot. Don't even start.</i>
- <i>Fine. Back to business.</i>

01:16:15.384 --> 01:16:18.581
The stuff is all ready to be moved.
All two tons of it.

01:16:18.754 --> 01:16:22.212
We're gold. We need to be at
the banquet by 2 p.m. Anything else?

01:16:22.391 --> 01:16:24.086
Yeah, just stay calm and...

01:16:24.259 --> 01:16:27.422
What, are we dating?
Why are you standing so close to me?

01:16:27.596 --> 01:16:30.429
- Back off.
- It's cool, baby.

01:16:31.533 --> 01:16:33.262
What is your deal?

01:16:36.505 --> 01:16:39.201
The Nearly There banquet.
Remember? It's tomorrow.

01:16:39.375 --> 01:16:43.641
- How's he gonna move coke at a banquet?
- I don't know, but we gotta be there.

01:16:43.812 --> 01:16:46.610
No, can't. He'll kill us if he sees us.

01:16:49.118 --> 01:16:51.780
You wanna use my wig guy.

01:17:40.903 --> 01:17:44.634
Hello, sir. May I check your briefcase?

01:17:46.675 --> 01:17:49.508
Oh, yeah. Thanks a lot.

01:17:56.652 --> 01:17:58.643
Thank you very much.

01:17:59.054 --> 01:18:03.957
Now, what you wanna do is take
this ticket stub. It's for the raffle.

01:18:04.126 --> 01:18:06.993
And see that car up on stage?

01:18:07.663 --> 01:18:13.363
There's seven of them, all up for grabs,
with plenty of trunk space.

01:18:17.005 --> 01:18:23.137
Trunk space. I get it. Very good.
Very good. Thank you very much.

01:18:35.124 --> 01:18:39.356
- That's what I'm talking about. Right here.
- There we go.

01:18:39.528 --> 01:18:42.691
- What do you think?
- I love it. Great stuff.

01:18:42.865 --> 01:18:46.426
Yeah, you look just like a rich cowboy,
came riding in off the farm.

01:18:46.602 --> 01:18:50.094
- Do me a favor. Tip your hat forward.
- No, I like it where it is.

01:18:50.272 --> 01:18:54.368
- No, seriously, come on, do it. Do it.
- Will you stop with that?

01:18:54.543 --> 01:18:56.636
That voice makes you sound crazy.

01:18:56.812 --> 01:18:58.905
It makes me sound like Maury Finkel...

01:18:59.081 --> 01:19:02.073
...founder of Finkel Fixtures,
a lighting fixture chain.

01:19:02.251 --> 01:19:06.551
Oh, it's a little voice and a character.
You got a whole back-story. That's good.

01:19:06.722 --> 01:19:09.452
Little touches. You wanna
make the character real.

01:19:09.625 --> 01:19:12.355
- What's your character?
- I don't really...

01:19:12.528 --> 01:19:15.088
I don't have a character.
I don't do voices.

01:19:15.664 --> 01:19:19.964
We're going upstairs. People will
recognize us if we don't have a character.

01:19:20.135 --> 01:19:21.864
- Think of something.
- Okay.

01:19:22.037 --> 01:19:23.299
Buck up, let's do it.

01:19:25.474 --> 01:19:27.533
How are you? How's it going?

01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:31.475
All right. How you doing? All right.

01:19:31.647 --> 01:19:35.913
Look at these two hot chickens.
Finkel wants some dinkle. Give it to me.

01:19:36.084 --> 01:19:40.612
Come on. Do it.
Lay it on, right here. Do it. Do it.

01:19:40.789 --> 01:19:43.656
He means a kiss. We're doing
little voices. Undercover.

01:19:43.825 --> 01:19:45.087
Come on, sweetie. Do it.

01:19:45.827 --> 01:19:49.490
- That's a sweet little pucker. I love it.
- Can I get you two a drink?

01:19:49.665 --> 01:19:52.099
You sure can, sweetheart.
Johnnie Red, neat.

01:19:52.267 --> 01:19:53.996
- Okay.
- Do it. Do it.

01:19:55.003 --> 01:19:56.800
All right. And you?

01:19:59.775 --> 01:20:05.577
- Do it. Bacardi and cola. Do it, do it.
- Okay. I'll be right back.

01:20:05.747 --> 01:20:07.214
- What are you doing?
- What?

01:20:07.382 --> 01:20:10.374
- What was that? You just stole my voice.
- No, I didn't.

01:20:10.552 --> 01:20:13.578
You gotta come up with your own voice.
That's my thing.

01:20:13.755 --> 01:20:17.054
- I don't have a cool voice like you.
- Come up with a character.

01:20:17.226 --> 01:20:20.957
You're a Texas oil tycoon guy.
You have, like, a moustache...

01:20:21.129 --> 01:20:23.029
Don't shame me.

01:20:23.198 --> 01:20:24.631
Let's sit down. Come on.

01:20:24.967 --> 01:20:30.269
So we can get down to business and then
get back to the business of getting down.

01:20:30.439 --> 01:20:34.000
Now, that's what I'm talking about.
Let's get down!

01:20:35.677 --> 01:20:37.668
Captain Doby, you're not right.

01:20:39.681 --> 01:20:43.276
But today is right.
Can I see a show of hands?

01:20:43.452 --> 01:20:46.353
I'm talking to everyone in this room.

01:20:46.521 --> 01:20:48.489
How many of us have made a mistake?

01:20:48.657 --> 01:20:50.022
- Guilty.
- Yeah.

01:20:50.792 --> 01:20:54.523
You know, I believe it was our buddy
Bill Shakespeare who said...

01:20:54.696 --> 01:21:00.657
..."To err is human, but to forgive,
well, that's right on."

01:21:00.836 --> 01:21:02.804
That's exactly why
we're here today.

01:21:02.971 --> 01:21:06.702
Because everyone out there
deserves a second chance. Everyone.

01:21:08.577 --> 01:21:12.604
Thank you. I didn't say it.
Bill Shakespeare did.

01:21:13.181 --> 01:21:15.445
Some of these guys were
in our surveillance.

01:21:15.617 --> 01:21:18.381
- I know.
- Check out the guy behind us.

01:21:18.553 --> 01:21:20.282
Already did.

01:21:20.656 --> 01:21:23.147
You think he's got the stuff here?

01:21:24.426 --> 01:21:27.725
- Where?
- I'd like to thank Bay City Volkswagen...

01:21:27.896 --> 01:21:33.493
...for donating seven brand-new cars
to our annual fundraising raffle.

01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:35.569
Thank you, Bay City Volkswagen.

01:21:35.737 --> 01:21:39.468
Okay, everybody. Go ahead,
pull out your ticket stubs.

01:21:39.641 --> 01:21:43.771
Hope you held onto it. Hate to have your
number called and have it left behind.

01:21:43.945 --> 01:21:46.778
Because this train's
leaving the station.

01:21:54.956 --> 01:21:58.050
Tonight's first winner. 63.

01:21:58.226 --> 01:22:01.093
- Hot damn, that baby's mine!
- Congratulations.

01:22:01.263 --> 01:22:02.628
That's one of his guys.

01:22:02.964 --> 01:22:04.932
- Thank you very much.
- Just wait here.

01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:08.194
We've got a winner, a new car owner.
Let him hear it.

01:22:08.370 --> 01:22:10.167
He's gonna ride home in class.

01:22:10.339 --> 01:22:13.900
The car. Cocaine is in the car.
He's doing it in front of everybody.

01:22:14.076 --> 01:22:17.603
- He's not that stupid.
- No, but he's that arrogant. Trust me.

01:22:17.779 --> 01:22:20.043
Number 117.

01:22:20.515 --> 01:22:22.312
- Go.
- Right on! Yeah.

01:22:23.452 --> 01:22:24.714
Yes!

01:22:26.321 --> 01:22:30.883
- Thank you very much.
- Sit. Now. Do it. Do it.

01:22:31.059 --> 01:22:35.462
Old Shakes McGinty did it!
Yes! Unbelievable!

01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:38.326
I'm a-richer, and I'm gonna kiss you.

01:22:39.034 --> 01:22:41.161
Get your hands off. I think...
I don't...

01:22:41.336 --> 01:22:44.066
My friend won. Give him the car. Do it.

01:22:44.373 --> 01:22:46.398
- Do what?
- The kid's from Texas.

01:22:46.575 --> 01:22:49.237
I don't know if he has a license.
He rides a horse.

01:22:49.411 --> 01:22:52.312
Do you have a ticket?
I need it to give you the car.

01:22:52.481 --> 01:22:55.041
- You gotta trust the kid.
- I can't, cowboy.

01:22:55.217 --> 01:22:56.912
I need to see the ticket.

01:22:57.085 --> 01:22:59.645
Pop the trunk.
Let's get that new car smell.

01:22:59.821 --> 01:23:02.847
- Who wants a whiff of that new car smell?
- Let's smell it!

01:23:03.024 --> 01:23:09.327
That's what I'm talking about. Come on.
Pop the trunk. Seriously, do it. Do it.

01:23:10.365 --> 01:23:13.232
- Do it.
- Listen, jackass.

01:23:13.402 --> 01:23:17.304
Either give me a ticket or get the
hell off the stage. You dig that?

01:23:17.472 --> 01:23:20.339
- Guys.
- Pop the trunk, candy man.

01:23:22.277 --> 01:23:24.074
You heard him.

01:23:24.679 --> 01:23:25.941
Pop it.

01:23:26.114 --> 01:23:28.105
What the hell are you two doing?

01:23:28.283 --> 01:23:30.080
Pop it!

01:23:30.252 --> 01:23:32.982
You screwed it up once already, Starsky.

01:23:35.857 --> 01:23:39.190
Like you said, Feldman,
everyone deserves a second chance.

01:23:41.563 --> 01:23:44.532
What have we here?

01:23:44.699 --> 01:23:47.793
Does this look familiar? Some cocaine.

01:23:47.969 --> 01:23:51.837
Captain Doby, I suggest you take
this to the lab, get it analyzed...

01:23:52.007 --> 01:23:54.441
- Hutch!
- All right, freeze! Everybody, freeze!

01:23:54.609 --> 01:23:58.511
- Put your hands where I can see them!
- Relax, pal. Relax!

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:01.877
- Let's do it!
- Put that gun down or I'll kill your friend.

01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:05.042
- Reese, what are we doing?
- Do it now! Put it down!

01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:07.211
I got a clean shot.
I need permission.

01:24:07.389 --> 01:24:09.550
No! No, Starsky.

01:24:09.724 --> 01:24:12.056
I can do it. Just move
your head to the left.

01:24:12.227 --> 01:24:17.062
No can do. You don't have my permission,
partner. I can't give it to you.

01:24:17.232 --> 01:24:21.362
- Your nuts are mine, Feldman.
- No, they're not! Your nuts are yours.

01:24:21.536 --> 01:24:25.836
Starsky, listen to me. I don't wanna die.
And I'm not giving you my permission.

01:24:26.408 --> 01:24:28.535
Please, put it down.

01:24:29.945 --> 01:24:32.641
Put it down. Down.

01:24:35.717 --> 01:24:38.185
Okay. All right. You're right.
It's too close.

01:24:38.353 --> 01:24:40.344
Oh, thank God.

01:24:44.159 --> 01:24:45.592
Stay down!

01:24:48.396 --> 01:24:49.795
Doby?

01:24:51.199 --> 01:24:53.690
- Come on, let's move it! Let's go!
- What?

01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:56.497
Walk away. Walk away. Let's go.

01:24:56.671 --> 01:24:59.469
- Cap, are you okay?
- Yeah, I just got my wing clipped.

01:24:59.641 --> 01:25:02.576
- Who the hell shot me?
- I'm sorry. I was trying to get...

01:25:02.744 --> 01:25:06.578
Starsky! It was Reese Feldman.
Reese Feldman hit you, the son of a bitch.

01:25:06.748 --> 01:25:08.773
Well, go get him!

01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:12.147
- Is somebody coming?
- No, we're on vacation.

01:25:12.454 --> 01:25:13.921
- What's going on?
- Gotta go.

01:25:15.490 --> 01:25:17.515
Oh, my God!

01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:21.559
- Baby, look out!
- Look, I wanna hit him!

01:25:22.731 --> 01:25:24.699
- You okay?
- Yeah!

01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:41.606
- Watch out for the bunker!
- I don't know what a bunker is!

01:25:41.783 --> 01:25:43.614
It's a sand trap.

01:25:46.821 --> 01:25:49.449
- Go faster!
- I'm going fast. I got it floored.

01:25:53.128 --> 01:25:55.790
- Dogleg right up here on the par three.
- What?

01:25:55.964 --> 01:25:57.864
- Watch the bunker!
- What bunker?

01:25:58.033 --> 01:25:59.500
Jesus!

01:26:01.703 --> 01:26:03.534
Come on. Pay attention.

01:26:05.807 --> 01:26:08.298
Hey! Get out of here!

01:26:14.549 --> 01:26:17.541
- Move that ice cream truck now!
- No, you move.

01:26:17.719 --> 01:26:20.483
- Bay City P.D. Move it!
- Let's go.

01:26:20.655 --> 01:26:23.852
Grab those and meet me
in the marina. Let's go. Move!

01:26:24.025 --> 01:26:26.516
If you guys are cops,
let's see some badge.

01:26:27.729 --> 01:26:30.892
- We don't have any badges.
- Show him your gun.

01:26:32.667 --> 01:26:34.032
Come on! Come on, move!

01:26:45.814 --> 01:26:49.841
- Come on, hurry up, let's go!
- They're coming!

01:26:50.018 --> 01:26:54.148
Come on, these two with the running
and the chasing. Stop! Go home.

01:26:55.357 --> 01:26:56.847
Goodbye, heroes!

01:26:57.025 --> 01:26:58.856
- To the shipping yard!
- Got a boat?

01:26:59.027 --> 01:27:01.188
- No, but I got an idea.

01:27:17.345 --> 01:27:18.676
Hey, watch out!

01:27:23.785 --> 01:27:26.720
- Okay, now what?
- Okay, we're gonna take this car...

01:27:26.888 --> 01:27:29.186
...and land it on that boat.

01:27:32.127 --> 01:27:36.461
- You wanna crash the car into his boat?
- No, I wanna land it on that boat.

01:27:36.631 --> 01:27:38.599
Now, go.

01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:42.728
- Go!
- I can't do it.

01:27:42.904 --> 01:27:46.305
This is unbelievable. Here you get
me out here to risk my life...

01:27:46.474 --> 01:27:49.773
...and now you tell me you
can't do this? I'm a quitter, but...

01:27:51.379 --> 01:27:55.645
- You're crying again.
- I'm not crying. This is different.

01:27:56.651 --> 01:28:02.521
It's my mother. She always used to say that
this was too much car for me to handle.

01:28:02.691 --> 01:28:06.058
- She said that?
- Couldn't handle the V8.

01:28:06.928 --> 01:28:12.491
- I don't know, maybe she was right.
- Hey, look at me. Look at me.

01:28:12.834 --> 01:28:16.565
I am not your mother.
I'm your partner.

01:28:17.772 --> 01:28:19.603
Now, go!

01:28:21.142 --> 01:28:22.803
Go!

01:28:26.414 --> 01:28:30.111
- Things could go pretty wrong, so I...
- Keep your eyes on the road.

01:28:30.285 --> 01:28:35.587
Listen to me, Ken. If we don't make it,
this... You know, us...

01:28:36.825 --> 01:28:39.521
- It's been good.
- It's been great.

01:28:39.694 --> 01:28:42.492
Now, will you stop talking
and hit that boat.

01:28:42.664 --> 01:28:45.690
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.

01:28:55.276 --> 01:28:57.403
Son of a bitch!

01:28:59.114 --> 01:29:03.881
- Come on, are you kidding me?
- Oh, my God. We almost just got killed.

01:29:04.052 --> 01:29:08.148
Thanks for pointing out something
I couldn't notice. You're a benefit to have.

01:29:08.323 --> 01:29:10.689
We should save them.

01:29:15.663 --> 01:29:18.359
- Son of a bitch!
- Nice plan!

01:29:18.533 --> 01:29:21.434
You gave it too much gas
and you overshot it.

01:29:21.603 --> 01:29:26.506
- Car has a lot of horsepower. I'll go get it.
- What are you doing? Stop it.

01:29:28.710 --> 01:29:30.610
Starsky!

01:29:31.813 --> 01:29:36.512
- It hasn't hit the bottom yet.
- Stop, stop, damn it! Listen to me.

01:29:36.684 --> 01:29:40.120
It's gone, okay? It's over.

01:29:40.488 --> 01:29:44.447
- But it's my car.
- I know it is, partner. I know it is.

01:29:50.031 --> 01:29:52.966
Oh, my God, honey.
That was so incredible.

01:29:53.134 --> 01:29:55.500
I feel like my adrenaline is just...

01:29:55.670 --> 01:29:58.935
You and me, babe. We are such
a good team, don't you think?

01:29:59.107 --> 01:30:04.977
I mean, this is just the beginning. We could
go so far, honey. I feel so exhilarated.

01:30:05.146 --> 01:30:06.738
- Come on!
- What was that?

01:30:06.915 --> 01:30:09.213
Son of a bitch.

01:30:10.785 --> 01:30:12.582
What is it, Reese?

01:30:18.626 --> 01:30:20.218
Who are you?

01:30:21.029 --> 01:30:22.758
I found your 9-iron, bitch.

01:30:26.134 --> 01:30:31.595
That's for putting hands on Huggy Bear.
Nobody touches the Bear, you dig?

01:30:34.342 --> 01:30:37.937
Yeah. Now, these will work.

01:30:38.346 --> 01:30:41.076
What have we here?

01:30:44.319 --> 01:30:47.117
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

01:30:57.465 --> 01:31:01.697
- We don't really do private shows.
- But I'm a good friend of Huggy Bear.

01:31:01.870 --> 01:31:07.035
- It's kind of against cheerleading policy.
- You need to change that policy.

01:31:07.208 --> 01:31:09.233
You know what I can't figure out?

01:31:09.410 --> 01:31:11.810
How the hell did you know
to get on that boat?

01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:15.541
When your two boys put me on
that undercover golf course mission...

01:31:15.717 --> 01:31:19.949
...that cat, Reese? All he did
was talk about that damn yacht.

01:31:20.121 --> 01:31:25.081
And like I say, why go to the starting line
when you can go straight to the finish?

01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:28.696
"Straight to the finish."
I like that, man. I like that.

01:31:28.863 --> 01:31:31.661
Are you interested in doing
any undercover work?

01:31:31.833 --> 01:31:34.825
- Not the least.
- Captain, let me borrow him for a second.

01:31:35.003 --> 01:31:40.441
The weird thing is, one of those briefcases
with $5 million just up and vanished.

01:31:41.109 --> 01:31:44.169
Oh, what is this, a brand-new fur coat?
Look at this thing.

01:31:44.345 --> 01:31:47.246
Yeah, I inherited some money
from a dead uncle of mine.

01:31:47.415 --> 01:31:50.179
Is that right? I didn't even
know you had an uncle.

01:31:50.351 --> 01:31:54.617
Well, I did.
And he was rich as hell too, baby.

01:31:55.757 --> 01:31:59.659
- Chin up, little man.
- I think he's still upset about the car.

01:31:59.827 --> 01:32:02.159
Come on, let's get up.
You're going outside.

01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:04.423
- No, thanks.
- We're taking you out.

01:32:04.599 --> 01:32:08.057
- We're gonna get you cleaned up.
- I don't feel like it.

01:32:12.507 --> 01:32:16.705
I know these two white dudes that got
a car that you might be interested in.

01:32:16.878 --> 01:32:21.178
- I don't want another car, Hug.
- Come on, at least take a look.

01:32:24.052 --> 01:32:27.385
My car. Where did you...?

01:32:35.563 --> 01:32:37.622
Hey, Hutch, who the hell
are these guys?

01:32:37.799 --> 01:32:40.359
I don't know, but I get
a good vibe from them.

01:32:43.171 --> 01:32:44.433
So you selling the car?

01:32:44.605 --> 01:32:47.699
Well, actually, your friend here
has already paid for it.

01:32:50.011 --> 01:32:52.206
I owe you one, Huggy.

01:32:53.481 --> 01:32:57.508
- All right.
- Come on, give him the keys.

01:33:03.358 --> 01:33:06.054
Thank you. Thank you.

01:33:06.294 --> 01:33:09.627
With this transmission,
you really wanna jump the clutch.

01:33:09.797 --> 01:33:12.357
- I usually...
- From second to fourth. I got it.

01:33:12.533 --> 01:33:15.001
- Right.
- <i>Come in, Zebra 3. We have a 420.</i>

01:33:15.169 --> 01:33:17.034
<i>Please respond.</i>

01:33:20.541 --> 01:33:24.637
This is Zebra 3. We're on it.
Hutch, let's roll.

01:33:24.812 --> 01:33:26.803
I think he means you.

01:33:28.082 --> 01:33:30.482
- Good luck.
- Allow me.

01:33:30.651 --> 01:33:33.211
- All right, thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:33:33.621 --> 01:33:35.179
All right.

01:33:35.356 --> 01:33:36.789
Hey!

01:33:37.425 --> 01:33:39.518
Not the...

01:33:41.929 --> 01:33:45.194
- How does it feel?
- It feels pretty good.

01:33:45.366 --> 01:33:47.596
I'm gonna take it slow,
get the feel of it.

01:33:47.769 --> 01:33:49.430
No, no, that's smart. Do that.

01:33:54.776 --> 01:33:56.107
- Starsky.
- Hang on.

01:33:57.311 --> 01:33:59.939
- No. No!
- Hang on!
