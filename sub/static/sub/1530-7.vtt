WEBVTT

00:28.360 --> 00:29.441
I don't mean to alarm you,

00:29.520 --> 00:31.807
but I think you may have
a mold problem.

00:31.880 --> 00:35.043
That sink with the standing water
seems especially concerning.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.768
Looking forward to it.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.050
You have the intel on you?

01:07.440 --> 01:08.771
They know.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.327
They know?

01:10.440 --> 01:12.329
We have three minutes, Agent Shaw.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.401
Hey!

01:19.400 --> 01:20.606
Time to go, agents.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.170
- Exit?
-Follow me.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.163
I was wondering
what you guys had been up to.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.684
- Go.
-All right.

01:48.920 --> 01:51.526
- Um, where are the dogs?
-Don't be ridiculous.

02:01.360 --> 02:04.603
I bet you're usually the one
holding something like this.

02:04.680 --> 02:07.729
Don't worry.
She knows what she's doing.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.882
Whatever you do, don't breathe.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.120
That was a joke.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.601
You should have cause for
comfortable breathing if you need to.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.803
Just not through your nose.
And very minimally through your mouth.

02:30.040 --> 02:32.008
Ah. There we are.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.849
That's all
the intel you recovered?

02:42.920 --> 02:44.763
Ah.
I certainly hope so.

02:46.280 --> 02:50.080
Well, thank you, Agent Shaw,
for keeping it safe up there.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.325
We'll push this through to the Hub.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.727
In fact, we're headed there now
to drop you off.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.121
Get you a change of clothes,
proper meal.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.361
You'll be good as new.

02:58.840 --> 03:03.209
The Hub? Really? How exciting.
It's been ages.

03:04.680 --> 03:07.923
Ah. Good, you're done with that
paranasal extraction nonsense.

03:08.040 --> 03:10.042
- Do you need me to analyze the data?
-That won't be necessary.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.361
If it's encrypted,
I can mine the chip for him.

03:12.440 --> 03:15.171
I'm afraid this mission's classified.
Clearance Level 8.

03:15.640 --> 03:16.846
- Uh...
-Ah.

03:17.200 --> 03:20.010
Wait, what? He can just shut us
out of the process like that?

03:20.120 --> 03:22.361
Well, he did say the mission is Level 8.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.965
And we're not.
So we can't know about it.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.246
Right, but this is normally the part

03:25.320 --> 03:27.368
where we all stand around the holocom
and we learn about stuff.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.169
I mean, aren't we all on the same team?

03:29.280 --> 03:31.521
No need to get started
on one of your socialist riffs.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.484
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s whole infrastructure
is based on the hierarchy

03:34.560 --> 03:36.244
and compartmentalization
of intelligence.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.840
Every agent can't have the intel
on every mission.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.689
Makes the entire
organization vulnerable.

03:40.800 --> 03:43.963
Okay fine, but if I just fought my way
out of an underground Siberian prison,

03:44.040 --> 03:45.530
I'd kind of want to know what for.

03:45.640 --> 03:48.849
Coulson's got you used to the plane,
the way we do missions here.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.922
The Hub is different.

03:51.040 --> 03:54.328
The Hub? What's the Hub?

03:58.840 --> 03:59.841
Wow.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.884
I didn't realize Big Brother was this big.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.765
Oh, this is nothing.
Wait until you see the Triskelion.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.683
Everyone's wearing the same suit.

04:14.760 --> 04:16.683
Someone tell me why, please?

04:22.040 --> 04:23.849
Do I get one?

04:23.920 --> 04:25.445
That's your badge.

04:25.520 --> 04:28.808
Which means you've got a long way
to go to even make Level 1.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.848
Copy that.

04:30.920 --> 04:34.402
Does it also mean no access
to any computers here whatsoever?

04:34.520 --> 04:36.522
I could run a search
on the redacted S.H.I.E.L.D. file

04:36.600 --> 04:38.090
-on my parents.
-Skye...

04:38.200 --> 04:41.170
But it just seems like
the place they'd keep them, right?

04:41.240 --> 04:42.571
I'll look into it.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.445
But right now we've got more
pressing matters at hand.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.488
- Agent Sitwell.
-Agent Coulson.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.369
Good to see you're feeling better.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.169
Agent Hand's waiting for you
in the situation room.

04:51.240 --> 04:53.561
- She doesn't like to wait.
-So you know her?

04:53.640 --> 04:55.642
Only her reputation. After you.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.643
Your Level 7s can join us
in the briefing.

04:57.720 --> 04:58.721
Say cheese.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.368
Victoria Hand...

05:05.440 --> 05:06.646
Is here.

05:09.800 --> 05:10.801
Ouch.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.931
Is this your subtle way
of saying I can't come with?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.729
We'll be back.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.602
We should probably
head over to the Tech corridor.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.570
- Oh, I can't wait to see the new chem kit!
-Yeah.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.924
I don't think it likes me here.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.682
- Agent Hand.
-Agent Coulson.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.002
Nice to finally put a face to the name.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.924
Likewise. These are
Agents May and Ward.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.364
Well, now that
we've gotten that over with,

05:47.440 --> 05:49.522
here's what you can know.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.285
The intel you recovered
from Agent Shaw tells us that

05:52.360 --> 05:56.126
a separatist group from South Ossetia
built a weapon called Izbutomiut.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.282
The Overkill Device?

05:58.800 --> 06:00.211
A little dramatic for my taste.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.089
I imagine something
was lost in translation.

06:02.160 --> 06:04.242
We've intercepted chatter that tells us

06:04.320 --> 06:07.005
they plan to use the weapon
in the next 24 hours

06:07.080 --> 06:10.243
to declare their independence
from Russia and Georgia.

06:10.320 --> 06:13.403
We believe it creates
sonic vibrations powerful enough

06:13.480 --> 06:15.721
to trigger weapons
from a great distance.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.087
Anything from the missiles
on a helicopter

06:18.160 --> 06:20.208
to a nuclear warhead sitting in its silo.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.725
So if we move on them,

06:21.800 --> 06:23.609
they could use
our own weapons against us?

06:23.680 --> 06:26.684
Exactly. That's why I need
a two-man team

06:26.760 --> 06:29.411
to sneak across
the disputed border undetected,

06:29.480 --> 06:31.244
break into the separatist stronghold,

06:31.320 --> 06:33.448
and disable the weapon
in the next 24 hours.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.524
And you have two people who fit my bill.

06:37.560 --> 06:38.641
Not a problem.

06:38.720 --> 06:41.246
I was in Georgia
during the incursion in '08.

06:41.320 --> 06:43.368
I still have contacts
on the South Ossetian border.

06:43.440 --> 06:44.601
And you'll have to use them.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.489
But we don't have specs on the Device,

06:46.560 --> 06:47.925
so I need someone on the team

06:48.000 --> 06:50.526
who can identify
and dismantle it on site.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.689
- Do you mean...
-I think she does.

07:00.040 --> 07:03.089
I found a localized EMP,
plus a few other party favors.

07:03.160 --> 07:07.165
Oh, come on.
What the... Open. It's stuck.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.290
The cart's stuck.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.844
That's unbelievable. What the hell!

07:16.920 --> 07:19.810
Who designed this?
In the Hub, of all places.

07:27.000 --> 07:27.967
Oh, that's...

07:30.000 --> 07:31.286
Seriously?

07:37.680 --> 07:41.287
I just can't believe you're going in. Dark.

07:41.640 --> 07:43.563
In hostile territory. Without comms.

07:43.640 --> 07:46.166
- Lacking any real physical strength...
-I'll be fine.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.762
Did I give you an antivenin pack?

07:49.640 --> 07:53.008
The Caucasus have a plethora
of highly endemic spider species...

07:53.080 --> 07:56.527
Jemma, stop. Stop worrying about me.
I can do this.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.681
Thank you.

07:58.440 --> 08:01.410
And don't you do anything rash
while I'm gone.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.922
Like jump out of an airplane.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.524
You'll be careful?

08:11.440 --> 08:13.010
Yeah, I've handled worse.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.486
Oh, I almost forgot. I made you this.

08:22.120 --> 08:25.090
Your favorite sandwich.
Prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.766
- With your homemade pesto aioli?
-Just a hint.

08:28.360 --> 08:31.204
Hey, is this what you wanted?
Also, what is this?

08:32.320 --> 08:34.527
Oh, Fitz. A full-sized mag pouch?

08:34.600 --> 08:37.649
Just one of the many tactical decisions
I've had to make already.

08:37.760 --> 08:38.841
Hmm.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.888
And Ward said we needed it.

08:42.280 --> 08:45.568
You need to disable the Overkill Device
by 0600 tomorrow

08:45.640 --> 08:47.961
in order to prevent the separatist attack.

08:48.040 --> 08:49.565
Once you signal S.H.I.E.L.D.,

08:49.640 --> 08:51.961
the extraction team
will get you both out.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.122
- Take care of him.
-Of course, sir.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.441
More moving, less talking, Agent Ward.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.165
Time's not on our side.

09:17.800 --> 09:22.089
Does this feel okay to you?
Shouldn't we be going with them?

09:22.160 --> 09:25.846
The people who put these ops together
are the best of the best.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.802
They know what they're doing.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.288
So, Simmons, by this point,
does not have a bloody clue.

09:42.360 --> 09:45.330
We're in the back,
trying to contain our laughter.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.165
So Simmons goes
into the vacuum chamber

09:48.240 --> 09:49.730
wearing a bunny suit,

09:49.800 --> 09:53.725
but we just call it that because
it covers your whole body.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.769
So, she's in the vacuum chamber,

09:55.840 --> 09:59.162
but when she takes her mask off
to speak to me,

09:59.280 --> 10:02.602
she sneezes all over the Faraday cup.

10:05.840 --> 10:07.604
Which is funny.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.722
- You have the beacon?
-Yeah.

10:10.800 --> 10:14.122
But it's funny because
vacuum chambers are so dry,

10:14.200 --> 10:18.285
and this instrument was actually
supposed to go into space.

10:19.800 --> 10:23.441
It had sensitive chemical components.

10:23.560 --> 10:26.166
Simmons actually tells it
a lot better than I do.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.641
Listen, my contact's Uri Dubrovsky.

10:28.720 --> 10:31.166
We'll pay him to get us
across the border.

10:31.240 --> 10:34.722
We go back,
but he doesn't like new people.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.167
So keep your mouth shut
and your head down.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.890
Um, can you ask what beers
they have on tap?

11:07.200 --> 11:09.567
- Uri's your friend?
-Yeah.

11:11.680 --> 11:12.920
Uri's dead.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.882
You have no friends here.

11:23.960 --> 11:26.486
Oh, no, no, no. Please be careful.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.169
Can you imagine what Fitz would do

11:29.240 --> 11:32.164
if the Night-Night gun was
broken when he came back?

11:32.240 --> 11:35.084
Surely he'll be okay out there, right?

11:35.440 --> 11:36.441
Well...

11:37.040 --> 11:38.280
Agent May's Level 7,

11:38.360 --> 11:41.250
maybe she can give us
an update on their mission.

11:43.840 --> 11:46.605
Does that mean that you do know
something and you can't tell us,

11:46.720 --> 11:50.520
or that you don't know anything?
Which non-expression is this?

11:50.600 --> 11:52.568
We know what we're supposed to.

11:52.640 --> 11:55.086
When we have more information,
we'll react.

11:56.280 --> 12:00.001
All right, clear out. I need to
run some diagnostics and reboot.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.730
That means you, too. Off.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.526
You guys may be okay with being
in the dark, but I'm not into it.

12:10.600 --> 12:11.761
I need answers.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.564
And I know just the person
who has them.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.720
- Who?
-Coulson.

12:17.840 --> 12:20.684
I'm obviously talking about Coulson.

12:20.920 --> 12:23.605
I'm gonna need three more chalks
queued up at the border.

12:23.720 --> 12:26.166
And a fourth standing by in Armenia?

12:26.240 --> 12:27.446
- Great minds.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.688
It must be nice to be off that plane.

12:30.760 --> 12:33.047
I understand you're almost
through your recovery.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.885
The plane has nothing to do
with my recovery.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.883
I only know what I've read.

12:37.960 --> 12:40.440
Seems Fury has a soft spot
for his favorites.

12:40.520 --> 12:41.885
Not everyone gets sent to Tahiti.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.201
It's a magical place.

12:46.320 --> 12:49.483
All I meant was, it must feel good
to be back in the big leagues.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.211
Two of my agents
are the key to this operation.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.601
I never left the bigs.

12:54.680 --> 12:57.968
Let's hope they're as good
as you think they are.

13:01.520 --> 13:05.081
What's happening?
Why haven't they killed us yet?

13:05.160 --> 13:07.003
I mean, I'm glad
that they haven't killed us yet...

13:07.080 --> 13:08.809
They're waiting for their boss.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.724
So before he gets here, we need a plan.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.882
How long can you
hold your breath underwater?

13:13.960 --> 13:15.007
I don't know.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.162
Are you familiar with the term
"slam and cram"?

13:17.240 --> 13:19.402
No. And I don't think I want to be.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.130
How attached are you to your pinky?

13:21.200 --> 13:22.406
Very, very attached.

13:22.480 --> 13:24.721
And before you ask
another terrifyingly vague question,

13:24.800 --> 13:25.847
let me be clear.

13:25.920 --> 13:28.764
Any plan that involves
even one of those scenarios

13:28.840 --> 13:32.845
isn't going to work for me.
As a matter of fact, I have a...

13:35.800 --> 13:38.451
I heard you were looking
for your friend, Uri.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.921
And Uri was friends with separatists.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.602
- Are you separatists?
-No.

13:44.280 --> 13:47.443
- We're here to stop them.
-Definitely here to stop them.

13:47.520 --> 13:50.729
Trust me. If you could just help us
get across the border...

13:54.920 --> 13:56.410
You're wasting my time.

13:56.520 --> 14:00.844
So let me be clear.
You've given me no reason to trust you.

14:00.920 --> 14:03.810
And trust is everything to me.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.162
Hey, fancy seeing you here.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.722
Skye. I told you I'd look into the file
about your parents.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.723
No, I know. That's not why I'm here.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.007
I wanted to know more
about Ward and Fitz's mission.

14:21.080 --> 14:23.481
Simmons is seriously
starting to unravel without Fitz.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.367
I know it's hard to hear,
but you don't have the clearance.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.763
But I have eyes.

14:28.840 --> 14:32.481
I saw six squads in full tactical gear,
three crates of RPGs,

14:32.600 --> 14:35.046
and a full crew of analysts
heading into operations.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.201
Are you really telling me

14:36.280 --> 14:38.089
that has nothing to do
with Ward and Fitz's mission?

14:38.640 --> 14:42.645
If I'm right, give me a signal
by not saying anything.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.929
Trust the system.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.771
How did it go?

14:50.840 --> 14:54.970
Nothing. He's acting like
a robot version of himself right now.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.724
If we want the truth,
we gotta get it ourselves.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.928
Okay. How would you suggest...

15:01.840 --> 15:03.444
- Oh, wait. No. No.
-Yes.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.683
No! I can't be a part
of your bad girl shenanigans.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.610
I like following the rules,
and doing what's expected of me.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.290
It makes me feel nice.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.850
Simmons, wake up!

15:12.920 --> 15:15.764
Ward and Fitz went on
a top secret two-man operation.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.683
And look, there are more men.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.127
And either it's a bigger deal
and they're not telling us,

15:20.200 --> 15:21.486
or something went wrong out there.

15:21.560 --> 15:22.891
And maybe there's
nothing we can do to help,

15:22.960 --> 15:24.121
but we gotta know if there is.

15:24.200 --> 15:28.046
What if they're injured,
or being tortured somewhere right now?

15:28.120 --> 15:30.407
Fitz? Tortured?

15:33.480 --> 15:35.482
What exactly do you have in mind?

15:37.320 --> 15:39.368
Okay, enough!

15:41.760 --> 15:43.046
Okay.

15:43.680 --> 15:48.049
Little to the left, Vladimir.
Gentle! Gentle!

15:48.840 --> 15:50.490
That's it. Okay.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.847
Can I get a little more light
down here, Marta?

15:53.920 --> 15:55.251
Of course, mishka.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.526
Thank you, sweetheart.

15:58.560 --> 15:59.766
Little bear?

16:00.800 --> 16:05.408
I like watching him work.
That little bear.

16:07.080 --> 16:08.161
Okay.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.802
It's nothing, really. I'm just a man.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.724
Get this man a drink.

16:29.840 --> 16:32.207
Oh, no. Here we go.

16:35.960 --> 16:37.086
Yeah!

16:37.160 --> 16:38.844
--Oh.

16:39.480 --> 16:40.686
Salty.

16:44.640 --> 16:45.641
So...

16:46.520 --> 16:48.443
Let's talk business.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.242
Two million rubles?

17:02.200 --> 17:04.521
We need to work
on your negotiation skills.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.522
I thought they were like pesos.

17:06.599 --> 17:09.285
And anyway,
you should be thanking me.

17:10.520 --> 17:13.090
I shorted the fuse box
with my localized EMP

17:13.160 --> 17:14.650
when we were tied up.

17:16.040 --> 17:17.883
- Really?
-Yes.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.530
And my plan worked.

17:19.640 --> 17:22.211
Because we're over the border now,
aren't we?

17:24.800 --> 17:27.166
--We're stopping. Why are we stopping?

17:28.119 --> 17:30.521
Quiet. Stay here, I'll check it out.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.766
Okay, maybe we'll both stay here.

17:53.200 --> 17:56.010
Fitz! More border patrol.

17:56.080 --> 17:59.129
Already moving! Hurry up!

18:13.360 --> 18:15.408
Sorry. Am I disturbing you?

18:20.240 --> 18:24.484
You know, I like this plane.
I like the way we do things here.

18:24.560 --> 18:28.406
Everyone's on the same page,
no red tape.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.767
So far, it's working for us.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.169
Most of us.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.207
And maybe I'm getting soft,

18:37.280 --> 18:40.727
but I don't like keeping things
from our team.

18:41.760 --> 18:43.000
If you knew...

18:44.360 --> 18:47.364
No, you're right. Level 8.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.081
But...

18:52.240 --> 18:55.767
I know. Trust the system.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.322
May? Thanks.

19:09.760 --> 19:10.966
Say cheese.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.728
Okay, you have the flash drive. Go.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.809
I programmed it with a decoy crawler.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.963
It'll use my browser history
to simulate my usual online activity,

19:21.040 --> 19:23.646
so while S.H.I.E.L.D. thinks
I'm trolling Reddit and Facebook

19:23.720 --> 19:24.687
with the laptop you gave me.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.285
You'll be hacking the files
for Ward and Fitz's mission.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.966
Right. Remember, once you plug it in,
you only have about...

19:29.040 --> 19:30.485
Three minutes before
S.H.I.E.L.D. catches on.

19:30.560 --> 19:31.766
Do you realize that
you keep finishing my...

19:31.840 --> 19:34.844
Your sentences. I know.
I'm sorry. Bad habit.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.366
This is actually a bit thrilling.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.169
Ah, good. I'm glad.

19:44.240 --> 19:47.084
Now, we just gotta figure out
a way to get the panel open.

19:47.160 --> 19:50.482
Don't worry, made a special something.
It's what we do.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.327
All done.

19:57.400 --> 20:02.088
Really? Wow.
Okay, uh, now just find a USB port.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.049
- Okay.
- Agent Simmons.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.328
It's fine, just play it cool.

20:09.240 --> 20:12.449
Hello, Mr. Agent Sitwell, sir.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.446
May I help you?

20:16.680 --> 20:19.524
Drainage pipe.
We'll wait 'em out over there.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.443
We can't wait too long.

20:21.520 --> 20:25.047
If they use the Overkill Device,
everyone on the border's in danger.

20:25.160 --> 20:28.084
- I'm aware.
-And that includes Marta and Vlad.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.322
Oh, you're on a first name basis now?

20:31.280 --> 20:33.248
Yeah, well, I'm just saying
their lives are on the line, too.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.288
So let's not get too comfortable.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.804
Call me Jasper.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.207
Um...

20:45.280 --> 20:49.842
What brings you to this
restricted hallway so late at night?

20:49.920 --> 20:51.649
I could ask you the same thing.

20:51.720 --> 20:54.371
No. Don't

20:54.520 --> 20:57.444
Simmons, focus.
Just make up an excuse.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.648
I was just on my way to the loo.

21:00.720 --> 21:02.563
I could swear it was
two rights and a left,

21:02.640 --> 21:03.721
but is that it here?

21:03.800 --> 21:07.088
That's a wall panel.
Why are you accessing it?

21:07.200 --> 21:10.522
Don't spiral.
Just say something. Anything.

21:12.040 --> 21:16.728
You certainly have
a gorgeous head, don't you?

21:17.240 --> 21:18.287
What?

21:18.680 --> 21:21.843
I like men that are about my height,
but heavier than me.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.922
Stop talking. Stop.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.207
Agent Simmons. Do you have
authorization to access that panel?

21:26.560 --> 21:28.130
Say yes. Say you do.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.647
- Of course. Of course.
-Great. Yeah.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.850
I certainly have it right here in my bag.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.206
He's onto me.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.282
Stop talking to me! He can hear you!

21:38.400 --> 21:40.004
Are you on comms with someone?

21:40.880 --> 21:42.769
This is Agent Sitwell, I need an escort...

21:43.160 --> 21:44.321
Aah! Sorry.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.404
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.410
--Ha!

21:53.080 --> 21:54.161
All right.

21:55.160 --> 21:56.969
Okay. Okay.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.491
I've definitely shot Agent Sitwell.
Good, good, good.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.130
--Was that all right?

22:03.200 --> 22:05.089
That was terrible.
You are terrible at this.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.400
That was a total meltdown.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.005
The Night-Night gun was right there...

22:08.080 --> 22:09.525
We need help. You need to go get May.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.763
May? No!

22:11.840 --> 22:13.569
Listen, that flash drive will only give me

22:13.640 --> 22:15.369
a few minutes of access
to the Hub's mainframe

22:15.440 --> 22:16.885
to find out what happened to our boys.

22:16.960 --> 22:20.009
So just go get May, okay?
Just tell her it was an accident.

22:20.080 --> 22:22.082
I'm gonna be court-martialed.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.291
I hope this works.

22:27.320 --> 22:31.041
Why do you think S.H.I.E.L.D.
sent in just the two of us?

22:31.160 --> 22:32.207
I don't know.

22:32.680 --> 22:35.763
They said they needed a guy
like you and a guy like me.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.486
Mmm...

22:47.200 --> 22:48.326
Is that a sandwich?

22:50.040 --> 22:52.520
Simmons made it. My favorite.

22:52.960 --> 22:55.167
Prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella,

22:55.240 --> 22:58.323
with a hint of pesto aioli.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.244
Here, you can have half.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.606
What the hell?

23:13.960 --> 23:18.124
There are dogs tracking us
and you bring a prosciutto sandwich?

23:18.200 --> 23:19.964
I can't believe you just did that.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.804
This is a mission, not a picnic!

23:21.920 --> 23:25.163
I'm well aware it's not a picnic,
Mr. Save-the-day.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.331
What's that supposed to mean?

23:27.400 --> 23:29.243
Come on, you obviously
get off on being the guy

23:29.320 --> 23:31.448
who always gets to throw
the last punch,

23:31.520 --> 23:33.648
who always swoops in to save the girl.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.803
Now you've destroyed the world's
most dangerous sandwich.

23:36.880 --> 23:38.245
Congratulations.

23:39.480 --> 23:42.848
I'll tell you something,
I don't need to be rescued...

23:52.800 --> 23:54.609
- Yeah. And I'll have...
-Listen.

23:55.920 --> 23:59.288
Before we left, Coulson told me
to take care of you.

23:59.760 --> 24:03.321
That is what I am doing.
Nothing more, nothing less.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.770
Here. If you're hungry, eat this.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.326
It's odorless.

24:20.920 --> 24:23.491
All right, boys.
Let's find out where you really are.

24:32.680 --> 24:33.966
"Redacted documents."

24:49.920 --> 24:51.081
Okay.

25:00.600 --> 25:04.047
There it is.
If I could just access the raw file.

25:06.960 --> 25:08.371
Crap! I don't have the time.

25:33.280 --> 25:34.930
Oh, my God.

25:36.520 --> 25:38.807
No extraction?

25:40.240 --> 25:41.366
What did I tell you?

25:41.440 --> 25:44.046
You told me to trust the system.

25:45.360 --> 25:48.443
And the system sent
Ward and Fitz in there to die.

25:52.960 --> 25:54.530
Good day to be a rat.

25:56.360 --> 25:59.648
I mean, there you are,
minding your own business,

26:00.240 --> 26:01.730
spreading filth and disease,

26:01.800 --> 26:04.883
and scavenging for
grub worms or rotten fruit,

26:06.240 --> 26:08.447
when lo and behold, you see it,

26:09.440 --> 26:12.284
a prosciutto and buffalo
mozzarella sandwich.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.040
Fitz.

26:15.280 --> 26:17.203
With just a hint of pesto aioli.

26:17.280 --> 26:18.327
Quiet.

26:21.760 --> 26:23.046
Feel that?

26:25.360 --> 26:28.250
A truck. It's coming.
Zip up the mag pouch.

26:42.320 --> 26:44.209
I told you I'd get answers
about your family.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.004
That's not what I was looking for!

26:46.080 --> 26:48.606
I was trying to find out what was
happening with Ward and Fitz.

26:48.680 --> 26:50.091
That's a classified operation.

26:50.160 --> 26:52.527
It's a suicide mission. I saw it all.

26:52.600 --> 26:54.602
The troop placements,
the aerial assault?

26:54.680 --> 26:56.205
Once Ward and Fitz
disable that Device,

26:56.280 --> 26:58.442
there's going to be
a huge attack on that compound,

26:58.520 --> 27:01.490
with no extraction plan,
and you hid that from us.

27:05.280 --> 27:06.964
I didn't hide anything from you.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.610
You don't have
the clearance to know that.

27:08.680 --> 27:10.569
Is that really what
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s all about?

27:10.640 --> 27:12.961
Level 5s are more expendable
than Level 8?

27:13.040 --> 27:14.201
Is that all we are?
Just a number to you?

27:14.320 --> 27:15.367
Are you done?

27:15.440 --> 27:16.646
I don't know, am I?

27:16.720 --> 27:19.485
If S.H.I.E.L.D. keeps a secret from you,
it's for a good reason.

27:19.560 --> 27:21.050
- So they can hold all the secrets?
-Don't interrupt.

27:21.160 --> 27:23.481
You just hacked a Level 8
secure server,

27:23.560 --> 27:25.927
saw operational plans
that you have no context for.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.725
If details get out, the whole operation
could be compromised.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.723
Lives could be lost,
Ward and Fitz among them.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.529
I know.
Those are two people we care about.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.762
On the plane you're always telling me
to think outside the box.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.645
So I went off book
'cause I was trying to watch their backs.

27:37.760 --> 27:40.650
Our team can go off book
because there is a book.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.650
A Hub. An organization
watching our backs.

27:43.720 --> 27:45.370
You claim that
you wanna be part of that.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.488
A S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Do you?

27:48.600 --> 27:50.250
Yes.

27:50.480 --> 27:54.007
Because someday,
I may have to trust you with a secret,

27:54.080 --> 27:56.526
and I need to know that you can keep it.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.809
Can I ask you one question?

28:04.680 --> 28:05.761
What?

28:07.240 --> 28:11.006
Did you know there was
no extraction plan for Ward and Fitz?

28:12.520 --> 28:14.090
That's classified.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.681
Okay. Go. Go.

28:41.480 --> 28:42.811
Shh...

28:43.080 --> 28:44.206
GO, go:

28:48.680 --> 28:51.251
- I'll signal extraction.
-Okay.

28:51.680 --> 28:54.365
Simmons calls it the magic window.

28:54.440 --> 28:57.205
You'd probably guess,
"Is that X-ray technology?"

28:57.280 --> 29:00.841
There are actually
S band microwave antennae

29:00.920 --> 29:02.331
embedded in this sheet.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.801
Works more like a radar system, really.

29:09.480 --> 29:10.970
Okay, let's see.

29:13.320 --> 29:14.321
Okay.

29:15.480 --> 29:18.131
Okay, we have two guards
on the west wall.

29:19.560 --> 29:22.609
Both carrying automatic weapons.

29:22.680 --> 29:25.524
Correction, make that three guards.
We have three guards now.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.802
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Ward,
he's attacking the others.

29:30.640 --> 29:33.803
He's coming straight for us.
Ward. Ward?

29:34.360 --> 29:35.850
Hurry. Inside.

29:36.520 --> 29:37.521
Ahh...

29:37.600 --> 29:39.011
That makes sense now.

29:45.160 --> 29:46.764
This must be it.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.086
Weird.

30:01.480 --> 30:04.802
Core must be inside here,
that's what's important.

30:04.880 --> 30:07.850
The piping around it just serves
to amplify and direct the sound.

30:07.920 --> 30:10.651
To trigger munitions from a distance.

30:10.720 --> 30:13.200
Doesn't look like it could
take a jet out of the sky.

30:13.640 --> 30:15.324
Well, you should know
by now, Agent Ward,

30:15.400 --> 30:17.004
that looks can be deceiving.

30:25.640 --> 30:27.324
- Good?
-Yeah.

30:35.440 --> 30:38.284
This is gonna take a while.

30:38.360 --> 30:40.931
- You have 10 minutes.
-I thought you'd say five.

30:48.800 --> 30:50.325
Agent Sitwell is in the infirmary.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.607
Apparently, a member of your team
rendered him unconscious.

30:52.680 --> 30:55.160
A misunderstanding.
I'll handle the matter internally.

30:55.240 --> 30:57.971
Tranquilizing an agent
does not qualify as a misunderstanding.

30:58.040 --> 30:59.121
You're right.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.850
But being told there's
an extraction team in place

31:00.960 --> 31:03.008
when in fact, there isn't? That does.

31:03.080 --> 31:04.491
I'm Level 8.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.450
I'm entitled to information
regarding the welfare of my team.

31:07.520 --> 31:08.851
You should've told me.

31:08.920 --> 31:10.490
Seems I didn't have to.

31:10.560 --> 31:13.131
And what would that have changed,
Agent Coulson?

31:13.200 --> 31:15.601
You yourself have designed
dozens of operations like this.

31:15.680 --> 31:16.761
You know how this works.

31:16.840 --> 31:18.080
Usually with an extraction plan.

31:18.160 --> 31:20.561
Barton, Romanoff,
they never have an extraction plan.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.449
They know that going in.

31:22.520 --> 31:24.170
Agent Fitz is unproven in the field.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.846
And knowing would've caused him
to lose focus or courage.

31:26.920 --> 31:28.524
That should've been my call.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.365
I wasn't sure you'd comply.

31:30.440 --> 31:32.727
Your team includes
an electronically tagged non-agent

31:32.800 --> 31:35.280
who is notorious for leaking secrets.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.522
Which reminds me,
how did you get this information again?

31:37.600 --> 31:40.171
I know what the safety
of a thousand men is worth.

31:40.240 --> 31:43.926
I know the importance of taking
the Overkill Device out of play.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.846
But I also know my men
and what they're worth!

31:49.600 --> 31:52.126
The decision to go in
should've been theirs to make.

31:52.520 --> 31:56.286
Perhaps. But you need to
trust the system, Agent Coulson.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.246
All right, show me the final steps
to disable this thing.

32:04.320 --> 32:05.651
I'll get it done.

32:05.720 --> 32:09.520
No, we stick to the extraction plan.
I'll be done in a minute.

32:10.920 --> 32:13.048
Extraction plan's a bust.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.361
What?

32:15.440 --> 32:17.488
Exfil team didn't make contact.

32:18.320 --> 32:20.891
Once you take that thing apart,
and I set off the remote beacon,

32:21.000 --> 32:22.331
we're on our own.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.406
You should go.

32:26.920 --> 32:28.081
I'm not leaving.

32:28.720 --> 32:31.246
- Fitz. There's no time...
-You don't think I can handle this?

32:31.320 --> 32:33.846
- No, I am trying to protect you.
-Ah, you think I'm a coward.

32:33.920 --> 32:35.843
- Is that it?
-What? No!

32:37.440 --> 32:40.523
I am every bit
the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent that you are.

32:42.960 --> 32:44.246
Whoa.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.327
You don't have anything to prove.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.444
What you said about me
always needing to swoop in?

32:52.520 --> 32:55.649
I know you would've jumped out
of the plane to save Simmons.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.290
And she knows that, too.

32:57.880 --> 33:01.168
I'm not trying to prove anything
to anyone.

33:02.640 --> 33:05.769
Okay? Before we left, you're not the
only one that Coulson talked to, okay?

33:06.160 --> 33:08.561
He told me to take care of you, too.

33:09.720 --> 33:12.246
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.605
I'm not going anywhere.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.246
You understand?

33:25.520 --> 33:27.443
And I'm bloody starving.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.441
You got the information. Now we act.

33:34.520 --> 33:36.682
- We're gonna get our guys.
-Somebody has to.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.604
- What about the S.H.I.E.L.D. assault?
-We won't interfere.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.569
You don't need a battalion
for an extraction.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.802
- Three can pull it off.
- Four is better.

33:44.480 --> 33:45.527
You're in?

33:45.600 --> 33:47.523
Thought we all had to be Level 8
to discuss this?

33:47.600 --> 33:49.489
We're not discussing anything.

33:57.680 --> 34:00.524
Last chance, Fitz. Are you sure
you don't want a head start?

34:00.960 --> 34:02.450
Because the second
you pull that final wire...

34:02.560 --> 34:04.801
--Your turn.

34:13.639 --> 34:17.565
Beacon's hot. The Device is disabled.
Mission's a go.

34:19.920 --> 34:21.001
Okay, Fitz, let's go.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.885
We need to slip out of here before they
notice the Device is powered down.

34:23.960 --> 34:26.327
- Got it.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.210
- We need a new plan.
-We need a new plan.

34:32.360 --> 34:35.681
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
-Yes. Theoretically.

34:38.480 --> 34:39.527
Hurry.

34:41.760 --> 34:43.330
Okay, finished.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.525
What was that?

34:50.320 --> 34:52.208
S.H.I.E.L.D.
They've started their attack.

34:52.280 --> 34:54.760
Which means we don't have much time
before they crush the compound.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.603
Get up there and take out
as many of their weapons

34:56.679 --> 34:57.920
as you can with that thing.

35:01.560 --> 35:02.641
Fitz!

35:28.120 --> 35:29.406
Behind you!

35:40.480 --> 35:42.721
- I just did that.
-Yeah.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.564
Okay, let's go.

36:02.680 --> 36:06.241
They said they needed a guy like me
and a guy like you, right?

36:06.320 --> 36:07.401
Right.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.690
It's the extraction team!

36:16.840 --> 36:18.285
Better.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.325
It's The Cavalry.

36:30.640 --> 36:32.529
Never get tired of seeing that.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.120
Are Coulson's people clear?

36:51.200 --> 36:52.531
They are.

36:52.600 --> 36:54.648
I thought there wasn't
gonna be an extraction.

36:55.520 --> 36:58.171
All our resources
were needed elsewhere.

36:58.240 --> 37:01.642
And it's Agent Coulson's team,
they didn't need one.

37:02.440 --> 37:04.249
Okay. Let's mop up.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.522
Thanks for coming to get us, sir.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.329
We take care of our own.

37:25.320 --> 37:26.924
Well done, Fitz.

37:27.280 --> 37:28.770
So glad you're all right.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.408
Yep. Good to see you, too.

37:33.520 --> 37:34.567
Oh!

37:34.640 --> 37:36.369
The sandwich, how was it?

37:38.200 --> 37:39.440
Too much aioli?

37:40.680 --> 37:41.920
It was delicious.

37:47.720 --> 37:48.801
You know, for a second there,

37:48.880 --> 37:51.360
I thought I'd have to find
a new supervising officer.

37:51.440 --> 37:52.885
Sorry to disappoint.

37:54.480 --> 37:57.165
The truth is, I was in good hands.

38:05.320 --> 38:07.209
I had Ward's back the whole time.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.520
--Yeah.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.371
Pretty much saved him
from a gang of Russian mobsters.

38:11.440 --> 38:13.727
And kicked a few guys' heads in.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.684
But enough mission talk already.

38:17.640 --> 38:19.688
Anything exciting happen at the Hub?

38:20.400 --> 38:22.641
I shot a superior officer in the chest.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.007
Hey-

38:30.880 --> 38:32.689
I was thinking about today,
and I'm really sorry...

38:32.760 --> 38:34.444
I just wanted to let you know that

38:34.520 --> 38:38.206
I didn't forget about what you asked me,
back at the Hub.

38:39.480 --> 38:40.641
What do you mean?

38:40.720 --> 38:43.087
The un-redacted file. About your past.

38:43.960 --> 38:45.007
I found it.

38:49.320 --> 38:50.481
Uh, What did it say?

38:52.720 --> 38:54.802
The document
wasn't about you directly.

38:55.320 --> 38:58.529
It was about the person
who dropped you off at the orphanage.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.168
Turns out it was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

39:02.680 --> 39:04.125
A S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?

39:05.480 --> 39:07.926
Why? I mean, who?
What does that mean?

39:08.400 --> 39:10.368
The agent was unidentified.

39:10.440 --> 39:12.841
We don't know if she was your mother

39:12.920 --> 39:15.366
or if she just found you on a doorstep.

39:16.640 --> 39:19.291
Mother? It was a woman?

39:21.360 --> 39:23.567
I put in a request
to dig further into the files

39:23.640 --> 39:25.244
for any related materials.

39:25.320 --> 39:27.402
But right now, that's all I have.

39:28.960 --> 39:30.121
I'm sorry.

39:30.960 --> 39:33.725
Sorry? Thank you.

39:36.240 --> 39:37.730
Thank you so much.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.649
- You finish reading it yet?
-Mmm.

39:57.840 --> 39:59.126
What'd you tell her?

40:00.520 --> 40:01.931
The truth.

40:03.120 --> 40:06.124
I told her a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent
dropped her off at the orphanage.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.244
But you didn't tell her why.

40:10.040 --> 40:11.121
I can't.

40:14.320 --> 40:16.926
Some secrets are meant to stay secret.

40:21.680 --> 40:24.809
Will you help me find out
what really happened?

40:26.000 --> 40:27.525
Dangerous waters.

40:39.560 --> 40:41.130
But I can try.

40:42.320 --> 40:43.810
Thank you.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.645
Poor girl.

41:12.320 --> 41:13.651
Company.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.848
Yes, I need access to a restricted file.

41:15.920 --> 41:19.925
Bravo Charlie Yankee 3-0-7-6-0-4.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.126
Authorization code.

41:21.200 --> 41:23.248
X-ray 2-8-9-6.

41:23.600 --> 41:26.126
You're looking for
a death and recovery report, sir?

41:26.200 --> 41:29.682
Yes, for a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.
Mostly interested in his recovery.

41:30.520 --> 41:32.249
It took place in Tahiti.

41:33.120 --> 41:36.681
I'm sorry, but you don't have
access to that document, sir.

41:36.760 --> 41:37.966
There must be some mistake.

41:38.040 --> 41:40.964
I'm Level 8.
I have clearance for that file.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.361
The system indicates that you don't.

41:43.440 --> 41:47.161
Would you like me to submit
a formal request to Director Fury, sir?

41:50.040 --> 41:52.008
No. Thank you.
