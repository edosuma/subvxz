WEBVTT

00:01.305 --> 00:03.000
I think it's great that they let a guy

00:03.006 --> 00:05.001
with a head injury have
his own show, but...

00:05.007 --> 00:06.805
it's not really fair on his guests.

00:09.601 --> 00:11.312
Why are you working on a Sunday?

00:11.549 --> 00:12.854
'Cause if I finish this today,

00:12.860 --> 00:14.754
then I can be home for
dinner tomorrow night.

00:15.966 --> 00:21.044
God! Seriously, when's it all
gonna stop being such a slog?

00:22.333 --> 00:23.538
Shit!

00:23.918 --> 00:25.301
Oh, I forgot to say,

00:25.307 --> 00:27.991
- Mrs Hammond's retiring next week.
- Really?

00:27.997 --> 00:31.622
She wants to spend more time with
her grandchildren... poor fuckers!

00:31.628 --> 00:33.817
Got this new bloke
taking over from her...

00:33.823 --> 00:35.233
he's making me anxious.

00:35.239 --> 00:36.733
Why? I thought you hated Hammond.

00:36.739 --> 00:39.428
Yeah, but at least I
knew where I was with her.

00:39.811 --> 00:41.651
What if the new guy doesn't get me...

00:41.825 --> 00:44.732
my teaching style, you
know? I'm pretty maverick.

00:44.734 --> 00:47.133
Okay, Captain, My Captain.

00:47.739 --> 00:50.544
I've gotta get her a leaving
gift, as well, for God's sake!

00:50.550 --> 00:53.750
What about, like, a tasteful sex toy?

00:53.756 --> 00:56.750
Oh, right. So, like a... like
a Waterford-crystal dildo?

00:56.756 --> 01:00.642
Well, don't go crazy, but
maybe... antique nipple clamps?

01:02.773 --> 01:04.157
Frankie just heard that.

01:04.163 --> 01:06.979
Great! Now we don't have to
have the nipple-clamp talk.

01:06.985 --> 01:11.985

01:17.540 --> 01:19.043
- Can we interrupt you?
- Oh, yeah.

01:19.049 --> 01:20.564
I was just checking the pricing on...

01:20.570 --> 01:24.023
Rob, this is James Cohen. He's
just taken over from Antony Tillman

01:24.029 --> 01:25.914
as global chief operating officer.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.616
- Good to meet you in person, Rob.
- Good to meet you, too.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.234
James is just here on a whirlwind visit

01:30.240 --> 01:31.732
on his way to the Geneva office.

01:31.738 --> 01:34.928
Ah, not such a whirlwind.
I'll be here for a week or two.

01:35.209 --> 01:38.080
I've been hearing really
good things about you, Rob,

01:38.086 --> 01:41.610
or rather I haven't heard
anything bad, and that's good.

01:42.156 --> 01:44.869
Yeah. Once they took the vending
machine out of the employee kitchen,

01:44.875 --> 01:46.461
I became a lot more productive.

01:48.094 --> 01:51.393
- Ah...
- Oh, yes, we have to get down to research.

01:51.399 --> 01:52.995
- Shall we catch up later?
- Okay.

01:53.001 --> 01:56.112
Ah, hey, make sure you close
the double doors when you enter.

01:56.118 --> 01:57.696
Those guys are afraid of sunlight.

01:59.321 --> 02:01.307
Oh, and, er, keep an eye on your wallet,

02:01.313 --> 02:03.535
there's been some incidences
of theft down there.

02:04.628 --> 02:05.828
Really?

02:05.929 --> 02:07.923
No. That was also a joke.

02:09.249 --> 02:10.449
Oh.

02:17.714 --> 02:20.631
I know the world has
changed a great deal

02:20.637 --> 02:22.997
even since I first entered the school.

02:23.037 --> 02:26.203
We didn't have hand sanitisers

02:26.209 --> 02:28.015
or blogs.

02:28.021 --> 02:31.883
We had... powdered soap and diaries!

02:31.889 --> 02:35.898
Caleb, maybe one day you'll invent
the next way to clean your hands,

02:35.904 --> 02:38.476
with, perhaps, a vapour,
or even a microchip!

02:38.482 --> 02:40.459
Wouldn't that be
something! I think that...

02:40.465 --> 02:42.974
Oh, my God, she's lost her mind!

02:42.980 --> 02:47.640
Now, would you please give a
warm Kingscote Primary welcome

02:47.646 --> 02:51.731
to your new headmaster, my
esteemed successor, Mr Maxwell!

02:55.425 --> 02:57.331
Thank you, Mrs Hammond,

02:57.337 --> 03:01.739
and thank you to the choir for that
touching rendition of "Umbrella".

03:01.745 --> 03:05.754
When the sun shines, we
do all shine together.

03:09.151 --> 03:10.351
Shush!

03:10.357 --> 03:13.048
- What do you think?
- I think we can break him.

03:13.230 --> 03:15.237
Did you see he was wearing
a braided leather belt?

03:15.243 --> 03:18.551
- Yeah.
- Tells you all you need to know.

03:18.557 --> 03:21.248
I see we have another
case of the giggles.

03:21.254 --> 03:26.202
Mr Maxwell, this is Ms Norris
and Ms Niles. They're always...

03:26.208 --> 03:28.271
- Hello.
- laughing at something or other.

03:28.551 --> 03:31.100
I gave up trying to find
out what a long time ago.

03:31.106 --> 03:33.290
And as it's my last
week, I don't mind saying

03:33.296 --> 03:35.569
I've always found it extremely annoying.

03:35.575 --> 03:37.862
Oh, well, I'm a terminally unfunny man,

03:37.868 --> 03:40.259
so I'm always grateful to
have someone lighten the mood.

03:41.558 --> 03:43.986
- Shall we go to my office?
- Let's!

03:48.776 --> 03:51.272
They're off to do the
head-teacher handover ritual now.

03:51.278 --> 03:53.906
- What's that?
- She squirts the milk of knowledge out of her tits,

03:53.912 --> 03:55.805
and then he rubs it all
over his face and chest.

03:57.209 --> 04:01.166
Now, when I look at a map of
Europe, I think of Napoleon,

04:01.172 --> 04:03.352
and all he was able to achieve.

04:03.358 --> 04:05.042
I can't help but wonder,

04:05.048 --> 04:09.767
why aren't we making more
inroads into certain territories?

04:09.773 --> 04:14.253
Now, I know you guys can get people
from the Baltics, for example,

04:14.259 --> 04:17.353
to start gobbling up more duloxetine!

04:17.358 --> 04:18.875
Anybody ever been there?

04:19.423 --> 04:22.385
Well, the chicks are high...
but otherwise it fucking sucks.

04:23.015 --> 04:26.523
You've got people committing
suicide for lunch up there.

04:26.529 --> 04:30.203
We should be moving truckloads
of the stuff. Truckloads!

04:30.209 --> 04:32.000
Just to follow up on the Baltic idea,

04:32.006 --> 04:35.406
- this is something Rob and I have...
- Ah, Harita, I've gotta bounce.

04:35.412 --> 04:37.066
So, yeah. You take over.

04:44.668 --> 04:45.981
So...

04:52.806 --> 04:54.908
Can I give you my BMW?

04:55.291 --> 04:57.321
Sure. Can I sell it?

04:57.327 --> 04:59.431
Fucking drive it off
a cliff. I don't care.

04:59.437 --> 05:01.923
Then, yeah. Why are you
getting rid of your car?

05:01.929 --> 05:03.823
Well, I just need to start downsizing

05:03.829 --> 05:06.166
in case we wind up pulling
the trigger on New Zealand.

05:06.172 --> 05:07.759
What are Catherine's
thoughts on all this?

05:07.765 --> 05:11.035
Uh, mixed bag. I think
she'll come around, though.

05:11.577 --> 05:14.696
Oh, I gotta go. I just
got a DM from Eric Trump.

05:14.985 --> 05:16.282
Ugh!

05:16.375 --> 05:19.198
- Oh, hey, James. What can I do for you?
- Rob,

05:19.204 --> 05:22.509
my wife flies in
tomorrow... for some reason.

05:22.704 --> 05:25.901
Would you and your wife... or husband...

05:25.907 --> 05:28.597
- I don't wanna make assumptions.
- I... I have a female wife.

05:28.603 --> 05:30.956
Would you like to bring your
female wife to dinner with us?

05:30.962 --> 05:34.180
There's one of those hoof-to-snout
restaurants in Knightsbridge.

05:34.186 --> 05:36.987
- Do you eat that stuff?
- Oh, sure. I'll eat a face.

05:38.581 --> 05:40.523
What are you two conspiring about?

05:40.529 --> 05:41.837
Oh, dinner tomorrow night.

05:41.843 --> 05:43.546
- My wife's in town.
- Oh!

05:45.036 --> 05:47.029
Well, let me know the
details of where and when,

05:47.035 --> 05:49.159
and I'll see if my
boyfriend can come along too.

05:53.031 --> 05:57.351
I'm gonna bet you 500 bucks that
her boyfriend has pierced nipples.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.860
- How will we find out?
- Leave that to me.

05:59.866 --> 06:01.067
Hey...

06:01.073 --> 06:03.631
good news about syphilis
in the Netherlands.

06:03.637 --> 06:05.260
I know! I'm psyched!

06:10.667 --> 06:13.692
- How's it going, there?
- Yeah! Good. Good.

06:13.698 --> 06:15.214
And what is this?

06:15.220 --> 06:19.128
Uh, well, that's just some
shit... um... stuff that I...

06:19.315 --> 06:22.122
- bring in to show them I was a person once.
- Oh.

06:22.612 --> 06:25.529
That's me in a school, uh, disco thing.

06:25.840 --> 06:28.364
Grade-one guitar certificate.

06:28.841 --> 06:31.843
That's me and Nick
Rhodes, from Duran Duran.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.533
- ♪ Girls on film... ♪ Oh!
- Oh!

06:34.539 --> 06:36.320
First album I ever bought.

06:37.211 --> 06:38.891
Yeah, I remember the
first teacher of mine

06:38.897 --> 06:41.028
I thought of as a human being.

06:41.446 --> 06:46.844
I saw her crying on the top deck
of a bus on her way home one day,

06:46.850 --> 06:51.312
and for the first time I saw her
not as a teacher but as a woman,

06:51.318 --> 06:52.812
with feelings.

06:53.202 --> 06:54.673
Oh, well, that's...

06:54.679 --> 06:56.704
But then we found out that
she'd been having an affair

06:56.710 --> 06:58.993
with a 17-year-old boy in sixth form.

06:59.194 --> 07:00.913
Can you call it an affair?

07:01.093 --> 07:02.483
Is it "relationship"?

07:02.997 --> 07:05.991
I mean, couldn't she
have waited one more year?

07:05.997 --> 07:07.476
Yeah! Yeah,

07:07.482 --> 07:10.397
or she could've looked into dating
a man from her own generation.

07:10.403 --> 07:12.694
Yes. I feel the same way.

07:15.886 --> 07:19.684
- Right! I'll leave you to your work.
- Okay.

07:21.000 --> 07:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:30.262 --> 07:32.257
What the fuck is that?

07:39.058 --> 07:42.350
- What'd it smell like?
- I didn't stick my nose in it.

07:42.356 --> 07:44.324
Well, I mean I doubt it's anything.

07:44.330 --> 07:48.145
It... it would've had to penetrate
trousers and then cotton underwear,

07:48.151 --> 07:50.666
unless he wears silk ones, in
which case he's a real pervert.

07:50.672 --> 07:53.785
- Oh, okay. So I imagined it.
- No, but...

07:53.791 --> 07:57.874
you know, if you didn't, then, he
made a multiple fabric blast-through,

07:57.880 --> 08:00.266
which is unlikely,
unless he's Superman...

08:00.272 --> 08:03.778
Look! A man... a man
in a powerful position

08:03.784 --> 08:07.465
left a moisture patch on my desk.
I don't feel comfortable with that.

08:07.471 --> 08:10.092
Okay. Uh, what are
you gonna do about it?

08:10.098 --> 08:12.445
I dunno. Be angry.

08:12.637 --> 08:13.935
Nothing.

08:13.941 --> 08:16.319
I think those are both great choices.

08:16.325 --> 08:19.317
Oh, uh, we've been invited to a dinner

08:19.323 --> 08:21.528
with the big Braeband boss and his wife.

08:21.722 --> 08:23.224
We've been invited?

08:23.230 --> 08:24.818
- Me too?
- Yes.

08:24.824 --> 08:26.953
Oh, God. Really?

08:26.959 --> 08:30.431
Oh... when? I hate work dinners.

08:30.437 --> 08:32.073
You've never been to one!

08:32.229 --> 08:35.236
I've literally never once asked
you to come to a work dinner.

08:35.243 --> 08:37.620
- What will they want from me?
- I don't know! Your...

08:37.626 --> 08:40.831
- wife-like presence?
- Yeah, but should I be chatty,

08:40.837 --> 08:43.376
like Michelle Obama, or should
I be more like Jackie Kennedy,

08:43.383 --> 08:45.469
you know, like, don't say much,
but when I do say something,

08:45.475 --> 08:48.078
really make it count,
like slag off the Queen?

08:48.872 --> 08:50.876
I think I'm gonna say you can't make it.

08:51.481 --> 08:52.891
Oh!

08:56.594 --> 08:58.438
_

09:06.837 --> 09:08.918
I wrote you a text saying I missed you,

09:08.924 --> 09:11.691
and then I saw the three dots, then
nothing. What were you gonna say?

09:11.697 --> 09:13.209
Don't three-dots me.

09:13.215 --> 09:16.816
Well, I was texting you
back "I miss you too", and...

09:16.822 --> 09:20.314
then I realised I didn't, so I stopped.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.009
Come on, Fran, we were having fun.

09:22.015 --> 09:23.999
Yes, but that's all we were having.

09:24.609 --> 09:26.016
What's wrong with that?

09:26.203 --> 09:27.403
I dunno.

09:28.523 --> 09:31.322
I was looking at Chris and
his girlfriend the other night.

09:31.328 --> 09:34.434
They were smiling and
they were laughing,

09:34.440 --> 09:37.037
and I realised that
you don't make me laugh.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.057
You make me grunt...

09:39.063 --> 09:43.729
sometimes, and you made
me miaow that one time.

09:44.236 --> 09:48.643
But I'm sorry. I don't want the
Poundland version of what they have.

09:50.154 --> 09:54.960
Not what I expected to hear,
but it's your prerogative.

09:54.966 --> 09:57.771
Other women your age would
be happy to have a man

09:57.777 --> 10:00.130
make them come their tits
off on a Wednesday night

10:00.136 --> 10:03.021
instead of watching Countryfile, but...

10:03.498 --> 10:06.112
such la vie.

10:08.304 --> 10:10.222
Enjoy being alone.

10:11.117 --> 10:13.940
And, uh, I didn't make you miaow.

10:13.946 --> 10:17.038
I made you oink, like a pig.

10:26.268 --> 10:27.468
_

10:27.474 --> 10:29.770
It's just the attendance
files for Year 5.

10:29.776 --> 10:32.616
Ah, thank you! That's
tonight's entertainment sorted.

10:32.773 --> 10:33.973
Yeah.

10:33.979 --> 10:35.770
That's a lovely blouse.

10:35.776 --> 10:37.378
Oh! Thanks.

10:37.384 --> 10:40.245
Yeah, Not everyone could get
away with a blouse like that.

10:40.628 --> 10:42.151
Kate Winslet, maybe.

10:42.415 --> 10:44.735
- Laura Linney.
- Right.

10:45.428 --> 10:46.727
Thank you.

10:47.917 --> 10:49.811
Um, can I talk to you for a minute?

10:49.817 --> 10:51.405
Of course. Grab a pew.

10:53.411 --> 10:54.711
Um...

10:54.717 --> 10:57.297
this is a bit uncomfortable,
but I'm... I'm just gonna say it.

10:57.303 --> 10:59.499
Uh, it-it's good to say what you think,

10:59.505 --> 11:02.036
right, instead of, yeah, bottling
it up... I used to do that,

11:02.042 --> 11:03.828
but then, um, I developed alopecia.

11:03.834 --> 11:05.917
I mean, it all grew back,
apart from one of my arm...

11:05.923 --> 11:08.433
- Anyway, it doesn't matter.
- Okay. Well, now I'm intrigued.

11:09.595 --> 11:13.114
Mm-hm. So, when you were in
my classroom the other day,

11:13.120 --> 11:15.244
I dunno if you remember,
you sat on my desk.

11:15.415 --> 11:18.646
And, uh, when you got
up, there was this...

11:18.652 --> 11:22.243
substance... When you got up from
my desk, you left a wet patch behind,

11:22.249 --> 11:25.022
and, uh... I mean, I'm not
implying anything, but I'm just...

11:25.028 --> 11:26.740
did you notice it, or...

11:27.357 --> 11:28.990
Well, I'm glad you asked,

11:28.996 --> 11:32.192
because I was wondering
what was on my trousers

11:32.198 --> 11:35.125
- when I came back from your classroom.
- Oh!

11:35.487 --> 11:37.028
- Really?
- Yes!

11:37.034 --> 11:39.105
Oh! So, you... you don't...

11:39.275 --> 11:41.104
Um...

11:42.638 --> 11:44.840
Okay. Well, um...

11:46.059 --> 11:48.654
I think... I mean,
that's... I'd better, erm...

11:48.660 --> 11:51.949
There's a big tray of... of Rice
Krispie cakes in... in the staffroom

11:51.955 --> 11:53.631
for Tess Smith's birthday, if you...

11:53.637 --> 11:55.636
you know, if you wanted...
if that's your jam.

11:56.320 --> 11:57.520
Jamsters!

12:06.963 --> 12:09.542
Well, I think I'm a pretty
good judge of character,

12:09.548 --> 12:10.854
you know, you have to be in my job,

12:10.860 --> 12:14.057
and something about him just
says to me, "I made the stain."

12:14.063 --> 12:16.153
And of course, I-I can
handle it, you know,

12:16.159 --> 12:18.979
but what if I let it lie
and he... I dunno, you know,

12:18.985 --> 12:20.367
kidnaps a student?

12:20.373 --> 12:23.594
I mean, if you see something, say
something, right? What d'you think?

12:23.967 --> 12:25.648
What do I think about what?

12:27.178 --> 12:29.172
It doesn't matter.
What... what do you think?

12:29.178 --> 12:31.514
- I think that's Reese Witherspoon.
- What?

12:31.520 --> 12:34.794
At the table by the stairs.
Is that Reese Witherspoon?

12:37.816 --> 12:39.016
No.

12:39.942 --> 12:42.912
I think it is. Excuse me.

12:44.367 --> 12:48.962
You know, Rob, I can see that you
have a vision of how to run Braeband.

12:49.327 --> 12:51.150
But you need room to do it. Am I right?

12:51.156 --> 12:53.476
Well, uh, yeah. I mean, I, uh...

12:53.482 --> 12:58.716
And I have a vision of you unshackled
and free to excel. Is that crazy?

12:59.467 --> 13:01.083
I've heard crazier things.

13:01.872 --> 13:03.483
But you catch my drift, right?

13:03.880 --> 13:05.663
James, I wonder if you heard,

13:05.669 --> 13:08.179
we got the results from the
azithromycin trials through...

13:08.185 --> 13:11.154
- quite interesting.
- Well, you know what's more interesting?

13:11.654 --> 13:14.933
They have two different types
of chocolate mousse here.

13:15.230 --> 13:17.136
Well, one's more of a cake,

13:17.142 --> 13:18.751
but I'm gonna get 'em both.

13:18.757 --> 13:21.638
What do you say, guys, shall
we get a few for the table?

13:21.644 --> 13:23.764
Huh, Mr Harita?!

13:33.681 --> 13:36.396
Jeffrey?! ***

13:38.870 --> 13:40.277
Jeffrey?!

13:40.462 --> 13:41.662
Jeffrey?

13:51.133 --> 13:53.209
_

13:55.846 --> 13:58.535
Hey. Um, Jeffrey's asleep.

13:58.846 --> 14:01.551
Listen, are you around tomorrow?

14:04.027 --> 14:05.925
I think he's ready to come home.

14:09.868 --> 14:13.674
Ah... Oh, is the coast clear?

14:13.680 --> 14:17.074
- Sorry? Oh, yeah, no, she's gone.
- Harita.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.101
Well, I guess she had
to get her Tinder date

14:19.107 --> 14:21.100
back to the orphanage before midnight.

14:23.083 --> 14:25.505
- Sharon, great to meet you. Ah!
- Mm-hm.

14:26.449 --> 14:27.746
Home slice, I'm gonna see you

14:27.752 --> 14:29.170
- at the office. All right.
- All righty.

14:37.497 --> 14:38.707
What?

14:38.713 --> 14:40.606
- What was all that about?
- All what?

14:40.612 --> 14:42.192
You were like a human laugh track

14:42.198 --> 14:44.217
for every mean thing
he said about Harita.

14:44.223 --> 14:48.263
Uh... look, he's my boss. I mean,
actually he's my boss's boss.

14:48.269 --> 14:52.770
- And it was a joke, and it was funny!
- It wasn't funny. It's bullying.

14:52.776 --> 14:54.748
Look, you don't have
to worry about Harita.

14:54.754 --> 14:57.353
- She could eat the two of us for breakfast.
- No, fuck that!

14:57.359 --> 14:59.853
Seriously, I'm fed up with this shit.

14:59.859 --> 15:04.842
I'm fed up with men just rubbing
their old balls on our desks, and...

15:04.848 --> 15:07.684
you know, ordering chocolate
mousse for everyone.

15:07.690 --> 15:10.350
You know, you didn't even try the
second one, and it was delicious.

15:10.356 --> 15:12.083
Oh, who cares?!

15:12.089 --> 15:13.669
Honestly, I've seen
you be shitty before,

15:13.675 --> 15:16.411
but I've never seen you be so... small.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.607
Jesus. It doesn't suit you.

15:30.628 --> 15:31.836
What are you doing?

15:31.842 --> 15:34.839
- Well, I thought you were...
- I just felt like slamming the door! Get in!

15:42.442 --> 15:44.149
- Hey!
- Hi.

15:44.354 --> 15:45.632
Where's Daphne?

15:45.638 --> 15:47.949
Oh, she's with my mum.
Come here. Sit down.

15:48.131 --> 15:49.647
Do you want some peach smoothie?

15:49.653 --> 15:51.510
- I made extra.
- Sure.

15:55.874 --> 15:57.396
Oh, wow!

15:58.199 --> 16:00.604
Did-did you get these
peaches from our tree?

16:00.790 --> 16:02.532
We don't have a peach tree.

16:02.538 --> 16:04.823
- We...
- So, listen. Um...

16:04.829 --> 16:06.915
if you find yourself getting...

16:07.115 --> 16:11.112
upset over the next few minutes,
just take a deep breath, okay?

16:11.118 --> 16:13.474
- W... why would I...
- We're leaving.

16:14.955 --> 16:16.453
Is this because of New Zealand?

16:16.459 --> 16:19.666
No. New Zealand is a
symptom. You're the problem.

16:19.672 --> 16:22.863
You're not God. You can't make us safer.

16:22.869 --> 16:26.826
We could still get meningitis
or hit by a car in New Zealand!

16:26.832 --> 16:29.935
You... you need
to sort yourself out, Dave.

16:29.941 --> 16:32.428
Okay. I-I-I'm gonna... I'm
gonna take a breath now.

16:35.800 --> 16:39.503
I am doing this for us.

16:39.761 --> 16:42.683
Okay? For our futures.

16:43.175 --> 16:47.597
- I am trying to be a good father.
- That's not how you parent.

16:47.603 --> 16:50.848
You parent by reading Daphne
a book about fucking ducklings,

16:50.854 --> 16:53.443
not by stocking a bunker
with two tons of rice.

16:53.449 --> 16:56.041
Yeah, well, maybe I love
differently than you do.

16:56.047 --> 16:57.545
Okay, Dave.

17:03.572 --> 17:06.763
Can just you go, and let Daphne stay?

17:11.700 --> 17:12.900
I didn't mean that.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.311
I-I'm sorry. Catherine?!

17:16.936 --> 17:18.358
Fuck!

17:20.834 --> 17:22.243
Arrgh!

17:23.236 --> 17:24.446
Ah!

17:35.356 --> 17:37.050
Oh, God...

17:37.754 --> 17:39.169
I've explained to Mrs Tucker

17:39.175 --> 17:41.264
what you came in to
talk about the other day,

17:41.270 --> 17:43.857
and I've also informed
her about the report back

17:43.863 --> 17:47.567
from maintenance regarding the
leakage from the ceiling, which...

17:47.573 --> 17:51.495
thankfully, explains the
moisture patch on your desk,

17:51.557 --> 17:53.300
and indeed my trousers.

17:53.667 --> 17:55.140
- Yeah.
- So...

17:55.146 --> 17:59.236
I just wanted to check that
everything made sense to you,

17:59.242 --> 18:02.536
and that you felt we had closure.

18:02.651 --> 18:03.851
Yeah.

18:04.719 --> 18:07.066
I... yeah. I feel, um...

18:07.345 --> 18:08.712
I'm sorry about...

18:09.548 --> 18:11.158
But, um...

18:11.164 --> 18:12.364
Yeah.

18:13.345 --> 18:15.263
Uh, well...

18:15.830 --> 18:17.030
No.

18:17.454 --> 18:19.252
Um, I mean that's fine about,...

18:19.258 --> 18:21.947
you know, the patch,
the... the moisture patch.

18:21.953 --> 18:23.730
That's all... I mean,
that's... that's clear...

18:23.736 --> 18:25.814
but I-I just think there was a shortcut

18:25.820 --> 18:29.610
to avoiding all of this, and
that's... don't sit on my desk,

18:29.923 --> 18:33.011
because, uh, I mean, I'm not crazy.
If you hadn't of sat on my desk,

18:33.017 --> 18:34.228
and I saw the moisture patch,

18:34.234 --> 18:37.254
I... I never would've thought
it had anything to do with you,

18:37.260 --> 18:38.923
because, um...

18:38.929 --> 18:41.822
Well, my desk is a desk,
you know? It's not a chair.

18:41.828 --> 18:44.337
So, uh, all good now.

18:44.994 --> 18:46.885
Oh! And, um...

18:47.400 --> 18:50.814
don't feel like you need to tell
me my blouse is nice, because...

18:50.820 --> 18:53.212
I mean, thank you, but I know it's nice,

18:53.218 --> 18:54.882
you know? I got it at Whistles.

18:54.888 --> 18:56.178
And the whole, you know,

18:56.184 --> 18:58.642
"Not many people could pull
that off" thing comment,

18:58.648 --> 19:00.946
it just made me feel a little bit...

19:00.952 --> 19:02.152
That's all.

19:02.158 --> 19:05.129
But, uh, I'm glad you summoned me.

19:05.135 --> 19:08.643
So, yeah! I think now we do
have closure on the matter.

19:09.422 --> 19:10.627
Yeah.

19:15.235 --> 19:17.962
I make my own career decisions, okay?

19:18.251 --> 19:20.748
I just want you to be
my mum, not my manager.

19:20.943 --> 19:22.352
Of course!

19:35.203 --> 19:36.590
Thank you.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.200
Uh, shall I take that?

19:39.277 --> 19:42.189
Well, I, um... dunno.

19:43.054 --> 19:44.477
That's my bag.

19:46.062 --> 19:48.384
You can say no, um,

19:48.390 --> 19:51.884
and I was thinking that maybe...

19:51.890 --> 19:54.106
maybe me and Jeffrey come as a package.

19:54.304 --> 19:57.208
- And I know you're still with Douglas...
- I broke up with Douglas.

19:58.606 --> 19:59.924
Me, too.

19:59.930 --> 20:01.934
Uh, I mean with Tanya.

20:06.263 --> 20:09.554
We might not have been Romeo
and Juliet, Fran, but...

20:09.560 --> 20:13.350
at least we were... Bull Durham and...

20:14.060 --> 20:17.895
you know, whoever Susan Sarandon played.

20:18.471 --> 20:20.279
When I saw you at the party,

20:20.372 --> 20:22.107
you looked so beautiful.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.764
Then, when I made you laugh,

20:23.770 --> 20:26.340
it made me wanna be your husband
again so fucking badly that I

20:26.346 --> 20:30.331
had no choice but to beat the shit
out of my dick when I got home.

20:31.829 --> 20:33.731
I thought I'd have to go to hospital.

20:33.737 --> 20:35.536
I practically yanked it off.

20:35.904 --> 20:39.789
And... how is it now? Is it...

20:40.288 --> 20:41.488
better?

20:42.127 --> 20:43.895
Oh, it's still very messed up.

20:43.901 --> 20:45.101
Mm?

20:47.918 --> 20:51.039
Well, you better come in, then.

21:02.647 --> 21:05.727
Rob, we'd like to offer
you SVP of European sales.

21:05.733 --> 21:08.337
We think you've got the
goods. And you know what?

21:08.516 --> 21:10.409
You're not a foot soldier.

21:10.415 --> 21:13.401
You're a general. Or a
colonel! I'm the general.

21:14.822 --> 21:17.003
Oh, wow! Well...

21:17.009 --> 21:20.968
I dunno what to say, other
than, number one, thank you.

21:20.974 --> 21:24.991
Uh, but, then, one-A,
that's Harita's job.

21:24.997 --> 21:26.582
Mm. Well, as far as I can see,

21:26.588 --> 21:28.380
there's nothing she can
do that you can't do.

21:28.386 --> 21:30.488
And besides, I like you.

21:31.545 --> 21:33.136
I like you, too.

21:33.529 --> 21:35.730
Um, but where does that leave Harita?

21:35.736 --> 21:37.232
She's out. She's gone.

21:38.435 --> 21:40.053
Does she know she's gone?

21:41.457 --> 21:42.657
Not yet.

22:11.179 --> 22:14.674
- Is that Johnny Squirty-Pants?
- Don't look at him. Just keep walking.

22:20.062 --> 22:22.465
I think this is gonna be
my last year at Kingscote.

22:22.901 --> 22:24.714
I'll find another school.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.710
I might go to bed for six
months, maybe, you know,

22:27.716 --> 22:31.619
do a bit of embroidery. Is
that okay? I'm really tired.

22:31.823 --> 22:35.387
Well, before you climb under
the duvet, I have some news.

22:35.684 --> 22:37.965
James offered me a promotion today.

22:38.051 --> 22:41.880
- Really?
- Yeah. Harita's job.

22:42.176 --> 22:44.677
Oh, my God!

22:44.762 --> 22:46.670
Fucking hell!

22:46.676 --> 22:49.010
Those bastards! What did you say to him?

22:49.016 --> 22:50.891
Well, I told him I'd
have to think about it,

22:50.897 --> 22:53.595
but... then on the way over here
I was thinking about what you said

22:53.601 --> 22:55.324
the other night, about Harita,

22:55.330 --> 22:58.511
and men sitting on women's
desks, and I thought...

22:58.517 --> 23:00.316
"I don't wanna be that person."

23:00.322 --> 23:02.385
So I called him back and
I told him I wasn't gonna

23:02.391 --> 23:04.619
do Harita like that,
and I turned it down.

23:04.625 --> 23:05.861
Right!

23:06.611 --> 23:09.427
Right. Well, I'm proud of you.

23:09.433 --> 23:12.653
That's great. You should
be proud of you, too.

23:13.128 --> 23:16.513
You know, you let them know
they wronged Harita, and...

23:16.519 --> 23:19.630
and you have a problem with that.
That's great. You said your piece.

23:19.636 --> 23:22.223
- I guess I did.
- And tomorrow...

23:22.528 --> 23:25.632
you know, maybe tonight if you
can get them on the phone, you...

23:25.638 --> 23:29.268
you tell them you've had a think,
and, you know, you're ready for this.

23:29.274 --> 23:32.271
You're... you're ready to lead
the company in a bold new...

23:32.277 --> 23:35.363
just, blah-blah-blah. I mean, I'm
not gonna put words in your mouth.

23:35.369 --> 23:36.774
You'll figure it out.

23:36.780 --> 23:40.367
What? I turned it down because of you,

23:40.373 --> 23:43.148
because of what you said. I
thought you'd be proud of me.

23:43.154 --> 23:47.072
I am proud of you. I just
said I was proud of you.

23:47.078 --> 23:50.212
I just don't think we can afford
to be idealistic, with our mortgage

23:50.218 --> 23:52.406
and credit-card debt, and,

23:52.412 --> 23:55.406
you know, you said you wanted
your... you teeth whitened.

23:56.496 --> 23:57.999
Okay...

23:58.416 --> 24:03.676
Oh, don't be all...
Come on. You're the best.

24:05.057 --> 24:06.489
We'll be grand.
