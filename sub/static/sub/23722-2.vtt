is a computer simulation.

47:04.543 --> 47:07.577
Well, that would make us artificial
intelligence. (CHUCKLES)

47:10.482 --> 47:12.315
What do you think the need is...

47:13.952 --> 47:16.118
to know where everything comes from?

47:16.594 --> 47:17.692
Fear.

- Death.

48:00.863 --> 48:03.263
This is very unsettling, Henry.

that's wrong with you,

something that you regret.

48:15.710 --> 48:17.210
I will if you will.

48:18.747 --> 48:19.846
Deal.

48:28.989 --> 48:30.822
When I was a kid...

48:34.394 --> 48:37.262
um, I used to catch spiders

48:37.297 --> 48:39.330
and I would put them in a jar,

48:39.366 --> 48:42.466
and then I'd fill the jar up with
water and then watch them drown.

48:44.971 --> 48:46.804
Is that really that bad?

48:48.074 --> 48:50.107
Murdering another creature
for entertainment?

48:50.143 --> 48:52.810
Yeah, I'd say that's pretty fucking bad.

Mom, why do you act like this
delicate goody-two-shoes

when you're so not? 'Cause
that's who my mother was.

50:20.794 --> 50:22.427
And no matter how much you try

50:22.463 --> 50:24.628
not to turn into your mother,

50:24.664 --> 50:26.764
you can never completely avoid it.

50:26.799 --> 50:31.169
Did you get my email? The one with the
yoga schedule at Quantum Fitness?

50:32.272 --> 50:34.005
- Yeah.
- You know...

regular exercise can really

50:40.451 --> 50:41.750
Mm-hmm.

50:43.115 --> 50:45.749
So, Mom told me you're speaking
at some conference next week.

50:45.784 --> 50:48.451
Yes, the Washington Philosophical Society

50:48.487 --> 50:52.022
has invited me to their
bi-annual conference,

50:52.057 --> 50:54.892
and in a moment of insanity, I said yes.

50:54.927 --> 50:56.693
Well, sounds rough.

50:56.728 --> 51:00.596
- Any word on your book?
- Um, yeah.

51:00.631 --> 51:02.464
Yeah, it looks like
it's getting published.

51:02.500 --> 51:06.335
- No shit. Which publisher?
- Fairfax.

51:06.371 --> 51:07.536
My old publisher.

51:08.406 --> 51:10.606
Wow. They're still in business, huh?

51:13.378 --> 51:14.442
Well...

51:15.478 --> 51:19.314
clearly they have great taste.
Congratulations.

51:22.219 --> 51:23.318
Um...

51:24.288 --> 51:26.521
- when can I read it?
- Soon.

51:26.556 --> 51:28.023
ASHLEY: <i>It would be nice
if you were honest,</i>

51:28.058 --> 51:32.192
because this feels
really intervention-y, and...

51:32.228 --> 51:35.396
I... just please don't say that
you're going to have him committed.

51:36.532 --> 51:38.966
Of course not. I've seen that up close,

51:39.001 --> 51:42.036
and once you commit somebody,
it's hard to get them out.

51:42.071 --> 51:43.737
But he is seeing a doctor, right?

51:43.772 --> 51:46.206
Yes, Dr. Farid Shokrani, best in Portland

51:46.242 --> 51:49.675
according to the Chair of Psych
Medicine at the university.

51:49.710 --> 51:53.079
- So why are we...?
- Because there are lots

51:53.114 --> 51:55.681
of other ways, as Ram's
family, that we can help him.

51:55.716 --> 51:57.716
Like having meetings behind his back.

51:57.752 --> 52:00.019
Like... not smoking pot with him,

52:00.055 --> 52:02.455
not making that temptation available,

52:02.490 --> 52:05.090
encouraging him to get out
of his apartment,

52:05.125 --> 52:07.125
away from his computer

52:07.161 --> 52:08.660
I keep calling him...

52:08.695 --> 52:10.716
although he told me not
to take it personally

52:10.741 --> 52:11.830
if he doesn't pick up right now.

52:11.865 --> 52:13.031
- Yeah, me too.
- Me three.

52:13.067 --> 52:15.434
That's exactly what I'm
afraid of, him isolating,

52:15.469 --> 52:18.270
cutting himself off.
We... that's what Ike...

52:20.807 --> 52:22.173
We can't let that happen.

52:22.208 --> 52:24.541
Okay, here's a thought. (SIGHS)

52:24.577 --> 52:27.911
Don't micromanage him,
and let Baby Jesus grow up.

52:27.947 --> 52:30.348
- Thank you.
- We can't just do nothing.

52:30.383 --> 52:31.548
Mom, what can we do?

52:31.584 --> 52:34.585
We can convince him to go on
medication as soon as possible.

52:34.620 --> 52:36.887
But he hasn't even had another incident.

52:36.922 --> 52:39.622
(SCOFFS) It speaks.

52:39.657 --> 52:42.525
- What?
- The newer antipsychotics

52:42.560 --> 52:44.632
- reduce the risk of future episodes.
- Yeah, but, Mom...

52:44.667 --> 52:45.853
- what are the side effects?
- He's not psychotic.

52:45.878 --> 52:47.397
Why do you keep using that word?

52:47.432 --> 52:50.967
Because pretending like the possibility
doesn't exist is not helping anybody...

52:51.003 --> 52:52.790
- (DOOR OPENS)
- ...especially Ram.

52:52.815 --> 52:54.737

- (DOOR CLOSES)
- RAMON: Sentimental about what?

53:00.777 --> 53:01.877
Hmm?

53:03.914 --> 53:08.294
Sentimental about my schizophrenia,
which has yet to be diagnosed?

53:08.852 --> 53:11.186
But who cares? Let's just
pump him full of drugs

53:11.222 --> 53:12.821
before he turns into a real problem.

53:12.856 --> 53:15.823
How can you even think
that's what's motivating me?

53:15.858 --> 53:18.126
Okay, here's the deal.

53:18.161 --> 53:19.860
I am 22,

53:19.896 --> 53:23.931
and if I end up undergoing any
kind of medical treatment,

53:23.966 --> 53:25.566
- that's my decision.
- Yes.

53:25.601 --> 53:26.900
It's my thing, Mom.

53:26.925 --> 53:27.968
- Yes, but...
- It's happening to me.

53:28.004 --> 53:31.571
And you can't control it.
I can't control it!

53:31.606 --> 53:34.908
Now, I know how scary
that is for you, Mom,

53:34.943 --> 53:36.243
because of Uncle Ike,

53:36.278 --> 53:38.278
but it's a million times scarier for me,

53:38.313 --> 53:41.781
just waiting to see what
happens, if something happens.

53:43.552 --> 53:45.018
My baby.

53:46.388 --> 53:50.122
I know. Whatever it's going to be...

53:50.991 --> 53:53.426
I'm not gonna come at it from fear, okay?

53:53.461 --> 53:55.327
'Cause that will kill me.

53:56.531 --> 53:58.797
(CRYING) I just want what's best for you.

53:58.832 --> 54:00.933
You know that. (SNIFFLING)

54:05.238 --> 54:06.637
I do.

54:08.608 --> 54:11.976
But maybe what's best for me
is not what's in store, Mom.
