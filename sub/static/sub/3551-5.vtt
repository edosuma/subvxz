WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.433
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.433 --> 00:06.006
BREE'S AFFAIR WITH HER
CONTRACTOR BROKE NEW GROUND.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.279
PERHAPS WE COULD
MAKE YOU DINNER.
 LIKE A DATE?

00:08.279 --> 00:12.012
I CAN'T WAIT TILL I GROW UP
SO I CAN HAVE BEAUTIFUL THINGS.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.715
GABY DOTED ON HER
BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER GRACE.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.787
(crying)
 LOOKING WHO'S MISSING
HER BIG SISTER.

00:16.787 --> 00:20.751
LYNETTE HAD TOO MUCH
ON HER HANDS.
 GET ME A NANNY.

00:20.751 --> 00:23.654
SUSAN FOUND THAT KEEPING
HER NEW JOB A SECRET...

00:23.654 --> 00:26.527
(gasps)
 MY PARTNERS ARE NOT
GONNA EAT THE COST.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.199
$9,000?

00:28.199 --> 00:30.201
WAS GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE.

00:30.201 --> 00:34.465
BUT HER SECRET
HAD ALREADY BEEN DISCOVERED.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.174
(Mary Alice) EMMA GRAHAM
WAS AN ORDINARY WOMAN.

00:43.174 --> 00:48.679
AND LIKE MOST ORDINARY WOMEN,
SHE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY DREAM.

00:48.679 --> 00:54.255
SHE WANTED HER HUSBAND TO KNOW
SHE WAS MORE THAN JUST A WIFE.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.527
SHE WANTED HER DAUGHTER
TO KNOW

00:56.527 --> 00:59.530
SHE WAS MORE THAN JUST
A MOTHER.

00:59.530 --> 01:01.832
SHE WANTED HER NEIGHBORS
TO KNOW

01:01.832 --> 01:06.197
SHE WAS MORE THAN JUST
THE WOMAN WHO LIVED NEXT DOOR.

01:06.197 --> 01:08.369
SO EMMA MADE A DECISION

01:08.369 --> 01:13.204
TO TURN HER DREAM
INTO REALITY.

01:13.204 --> 01:15.176
I WANNA DO A CABARET SHOW.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.807
I'LL NEED A BAND,
ORCHESTRATIONS,

01:16.807 --> 01:19.810
AND SOUND EQUIPMENT, AND YOU
ARE GONNA PAY FOR ALL OF IT.

01:22.113 --> 01:26.117
AND THAT IS HOW EMMA GRAHAM'S
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS

01:26.117 --> 01:28.359
CAME TO GATHER
AT THE SMOKEHOUSE LOUNGE

01:28.359 --> 01:29.460
TWO WEEKS LATER.

01:29.460 --> 01:31.422
OH. YAHOO!

01:33.264 --> 01:35.166
♪♪♪

01:35.166 --> 01:36.667
THEY WOULD SOON LEARN

01:36.667 --> 01:40.371
EMMA GRAHAM

02:43.734 --> 02:45.336
HAD FINALLY COME TRUE.

02:45.336 --> 02:50.301
UNFORTUNATELY, THE HIGH NOTE
THAT ENDED THE EVENING...

02:50.301 --> 02:53.804
(screaming and grunting)

02:53.804 --> 02:54.945
(music stops)

02:54.945 --> 02:56.807
DID NOT COME FROM EMMA.

02:56.807 --> 02:58.309
I'M GONNA KILL YOU!

02:58.309 --> 02:59.750
YOU WHORE!

02:59.750 --> 03:02.713
OKAY, LADIES, PLEASE!

03:02.713 --> 03:04.315
OHH!
 (thud)

03:04.315 --> 03:07.187
UHH! OH, MY NOSE!

03:07.187 --> 03:27.238
MY NOSE, MY NOSE. AAH!

03:27.238 --> 03:30.711
SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING
WAS WRONG.

03:30.711 --> 03:34.885
SHE KNEW IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS.

03:34.885 --> 03:39.550
SHE KNEW THE RISKS
IF PEOPLE FOUND OUT.

03:39.550 --> 03:42.893
BUT SUSAN DELFINO
WAS DETERMINED

03:42.893 --> 03:45.856
TO GET BACK TO WISTERIA LANE,

03:45.856 --> 03:50.531
AND THAT IS HOW HER WORLD
BEGAN TO FALL APART.

03:50.531 --> 03:53.233
HI. I'M TANYA.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.907
THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING
TO SPEND TIME WITH ME.

03:56.907 --> 03:59.740
I'M ALL YOURS
FOR THE NEXT HOUR.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.241
HOW ABOUT WE START

04:01.241 --> 04:04.244
BY GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER
A LITTLE BETTER?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.577
Show me your jugs.

04:06.577 --> 04:12.683
(laughs) AREN'T YOU...
A FRISKY LITTLE... OOH!

04:12.683 --> 04:14.985
I SEE SOME DIRT
UNDER THE COFFEE TABLE.

04:14.985 --> 04:18.928
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO VACUUM?

04:18.928 --> 04:22.433
Sure, right after you take out
those tots and shake 'em.

04:22.433 --> 04:24.595
(gasps) SLOW DOWN.

04:24.595 --> 04:27.598
(laughs nervously)
WE'VE GOT, UM...

04:27.598 --> 04:30.641
59 MORE MINUTES TOGETHER.

04:30.641 --> 04:32.803
AND, UH...

04:32.803 --> 04:36.046
ISN'T IT SEXIER
TO WARM EACH OTHER UP

04:36.046 --> 04:41.011
WITH SOME... (breathy voice)
NAUGHTY TALK FIRST?

04:41.011 --> 04:42.513
I have to listen

04:42.513 --> 04:45.516
to my old lady's blah-blah-blah
all day long.

04:45.516 --> 04:47.988
Lose the top so I can see
those money-makers.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.891
WHAT, ARE YOU READING
FROM A BOOB THESAURUS?

04:50.891 --> 04:52.593
(clicks teeth) COME ON.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.895
ISN'T THERE SOME
ROMANTIC FANTASY

04:54.895 --> 04:57.368
YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE
WITH ME?

04:57.368 --> 05:00.931
Okay.

05:00.931 --> 05:02.433
Are you lactating?

05:02.433 --> 05:04.875
OH, PIG!

05:04.875 --> 05:06.377
YOU NEVER DO THAT.

05:06.377 --> 05:08.739
YOU NEVER PULL THE PLUG
ON A SESSION!

05:08.739 --> 05:10.741
THE GUY WAS A TOTAL PERV

05:10.741 --> 05:12.743
WHO CLEARLY HAD
SERIOUS MOTHER ISSUES.

05:12.743 --> 05:15.716
YOU COST US A MAJOR CLIENT.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.789
AND GOD FORBID HE STARTS
TALKING ABOUT THIS AT WORK.

05:18.789 --> 05:21.452
WE COULD LOSE
THE WHOLE CITY COUNCIL!

05:21.452 --> 05:24.595
(sighs) I'M SORRY.

05:24.595 --> 05:25.896
I LOST MY NERVE.

05:25.896 --> 05:30.861
SUSAN, I CAN'T KEEP GIVING YOU
CHANCES LIKE THIS.

05:30.861 --> 05:33.634
(cell phone rings)

05:33.634 --> 05:34.935
(sighs)
 (beep)

05:34.935 --> 05:37.638
VA-VA-VA-BROOM.

05:37.638 --> 05:40.411
OH, YOU WANT A PRIVATE SESSION
WITH TANYA.

05:40.411 --> 05:42.873
I'M SORRY.
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

05:42.873 --> 05:44.875
SHE DOESN'T WORK FOR ME
ANYMORE.

05:44.875 --> 05:46.046
(beep)

05:46.046 --> 05:48.479
(door opens and closes)

05:48.479 --> 05:51.652
OH, ONCE AGAIN,
I AM SO SORRY.

05:51.652 --> 05:55.986
I FORGOT THAT FRENCH RESTAURANT
WAS SO FORMAL.

05:55.986 --> 06:00.060
(sighs) NEXT TIME, I WILL PICK
A PLACE WITH FEWER FORKS.

06:00.060 --> 06:03.133
YEAH, THANKS AGAIN FOR
HELPING ME OUT WITH THAT.

06:03.133 --> 06:05.396
WELL, I...
I HAD A LOT OF FUN.

06:06.997 --> 06:08.939
GOOD NIGHT.

06:11.101 --> 06:12.503
KEITH?

06:12.503 --> 06:15.075
DID YOU REALLY HAVE
A LOT OF FUN?

06:15.075 --> 06:17.648
YEAH. (chuckles)
WHY DO YOU ASK?

06:17.648 --> 06:19.950
WELL, BECAUSE IT'S
OUR THIRD DATE, AND YOU JUST

06:19.950 --> 06:23.484
KISSED ME LIKE YOU WERE SAYING
GOOD NIGHT TO YOUR AUNT.

06:23.484 --> 06:26.016
I'M TRYING TO TREAT YOU
LIKE A LADY.

06:26.016 --> 06:28.989
OH, THAT'S SWEET.

06:28.989 --> 06:32.162
NOW KNOCK IT OFF.

06:32.162 --> 06:33.664
MMM.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.968
THREE TIMES?

06:37.968 --> 06:39.900
IN ONE NIGHT.

06:39.900 --> 06:43.173
OH, MY GOD. THREE TIMES
IS MY ENTIRE SEPTEMBER.

06:43.173 --> 06:46.006
I JUST HAD THE NICEST CHAT
WITH GRACE.

06:46.006 --> 06:49.880
SHE SAID THE CUTEST THING.
 BREE HAD SEX THREE TIMES
LAST NIGHT.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.982
OH, SCREW MY STORY.
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

06:51.982 --> 06:56.016
THE SEX WAS AMAZING.

06:56.016 --> 06:59.019
IT WAS LIKE...
OH, HOW TO DESCRIBE IT?

06:59.019 --> 07:01.452
(gasps) AN OPERA.

07:01.452 --> 07:03.554
YOU FELL ASLEEP DURING IT?

07:03.554 --> 07:06.557
I'M TELLING YOU, MAKING LOVE
TO A MAN IN HIS 30s--

07:06.557 --> 07:09.059
IT'S LIKE--OH, THE--THE SUN
SHINES BRIGHTER,

07:09.059 --> 07:12.062
THE GRASS LOOKS GREENER,
FOOD TASTES BETTER.

07:12.062 --> 07:14.164
OKAY, WE GET IT.
YOU HAD SEX THREE TIMES.

07:14.164 --> 07:15.466
(squeals) THREE!

07:15.466 --> 07:17.067
(laughs)

07:17.067 --> 07:20.210
OH, HEY, LOOK.
RENEE'S BACK FROM NEW YORK.

07:20.210 --> 07:22.012
OH, GOD, YOU INVITED HER?

07:22.012 --> 07:24.114
WHAT,
NOW YOU DON'T LIKE RENEE?

07:24.114 --> 07:27.117
I KNOW SHE'S YOUR FRIEND,
BUT ISN'T SHE KIND OF

07:27.117 --> 07:29.219
A SELF-ABSORBED,
NARCISSISTIC DIVA?

07:29.219 --> 07:32.122
GOOD POINT.
WE ALREADY HAVE ONE OF THOSE.

07:32.122 --> 07:33.584
(slap)

07:33.584 --> 07:35.586
DROP THE DRUGSTORE CHAMPAGNE,
LADIES,

07:35.586 --> 07:37.588
AND MAKE WAY
FOR THE REAL STUFF.

07:37.588 --> 07:40.030
(cork pops)
 WE ARE CELEBRATING!

07:40.030 --> 07:42.493
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

07:42.493 --> 07:43.994
OH, MY DIVORCE SETTLEMENT.

07:43.994 --> 07:46.997
I JUST SOAKED MY EX FOR...
WELL, A WHOLE LOT OF THESE.

07:46.997 --> 07:49.500
I THOUGHT THERE WAS
A PRENUP.
 (pouring champagne)

07:49.500 --> 07:51.972
YEP, THERE WAS,
BUT NO PRENUP IS A MATCH

07:51.972 --> 07:54.975
FOR THE LEGAL TEAM OF GRIND'EM,
SCREW'EM, AND ROTHENBERG.
 THAT WAS ICED TEA.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.808
WELL, I JUST MADE IT FUN.

07:57.808 --> 08:00.811
NOW I WANNA HAVE YOU ALL OVER
FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

08:00.811 --> 08:02.813
I'VE GOT TWO MORE CASES
OF CHAMPAGNE,

08:02.813 --> 08:05.185
A TRUCKLOAD OF CAVIAR,
AND A PILE OF MONEY

08:05.185 --> 08:08.689
TO ROLL AROUND NAKED IN.
(laughs) WHAT DO YOU SAY?

08:08.689 --> 08:13.093
IF THERE'S MORE OF THIS,
I AM DEFINITELY THERE.
 GREAT. HOW ABOUT YOU, BREE?

08:13.093 --> 08:16.567
OH, I WISH I COULD, BUT I HAVE
A DATE. I NEED TO CARBO-LOAD.

08:16.567 --> 08:19.570
I'VE GOTTA PASS, TOO.
WE STILL HAVEN'T FOUND A NANNY,

08:19.570 --> 08:22.032
AND SO TOM'S WORKING LATE,
SO I HAVE TO GO--
 YAWN. SUSAN.

08:22.032 --> 08:24.504
I WOULD, BUT IT'S MACARONI
AND COUPON CLIPPING NIGHT

08:24.504 --> 08:26.506
AT MY HOUSE.

08:26.506 --> 08:31.111
YAWN AND SAD. WELL, I GUESS
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.644
GABS AND NEE.

08:33.644 --> 08:35.145
THAT IS GREAT.

08:35.145 --> 08:38.217
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT
HOW MUCH YOU TWO HAVE IN COMMON.

08:38.217 --> 08:40.150
WEREN'T WE, GABS?

08:42.052 --> 08:44.054
THANKS SO MUCH.
YOUR BABY'S REALLY CUTE.

08:44.054 --> 08:46.526
IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU.
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.
 THANKS.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.828
MM-HMM.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.801
(door closes)
 WELL?
ANY LUCK FINDING A NANNY?

08:50.801 --> 08:52.803
NO.
I'VE INTERVIEWED EIGHT GIRLS.

08:52.803 --> 08:54.805
THEY'RE ALL EITHER
TOO INEXPERIENCED

08:54.805 --> 08:56.266
OR TOO EXPENSIVE.

08:56.266 --> 08:59.539
HMM. WHAT ABOUT THE ONE
WITH THE BOOBS?

08:59.539 --> 09:02.643
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOT
HIRING HER.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.645
WELL, DON'T GIVE UP YET,

09:04.645 --> 09:07.247
BECAUSE I FOUND US
ONE MORE APPLICANT.

09:07.247 --> 09:10.821
YOU DID?
YOU TOOK THE INITIATIVE?

09:10.821 --> 09:12.953
WHY SO SURPRISED?

09:12.953 --> 09:15.726
OUR CHRISTMAS LIGHTS
ARE STILL UP FROM LAST YEAR.

09:15.726 --> 09:17.027
(car door closes)

09:17.027 --> 09:20.130
AND NOT ONLY IS SHE PUNCTUAL,
SHE'S EARLY.

09:20.130 --> 09:23.093
WHO IS IT?
 UM, LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY.

09:23.093 --> 09:26.096
LYNETTE, REMEMBER HOW
YOU ALWAYS USED TO HATE YAMS?

09:26.096 --> 09:28.599
BUT THEN YOU GAVE THEM
A SECOND CHANCE

09:28.599 --> 09:30.701
AND THEY WEREN'T SO BAD.
AND OVER TIME,

09:30.701 --> 09:34.344
YOU REALIZED, "I LIKE YAMS.
YAMS ARE GREAT."

09:34.344 --> 09:39.009
WELL, SOMETIMES, LYNETTE,
PEOPLE ARE LIKE YAMS.

09:39.009 --> 09:43.153
WHAT'D YOU DO?

09:43.153 --> 09:44.915
(gasps) ARE YOU INSANE?

09:44.915 --> 09:46.917
I WAS TALKING TO HER
LAST NIGHT.

09:46.917 --> 09:50.060
I-I MENTIONED WE MIGHT
NEED HELP, AND SHE VOLUNTEERED.

09:50.060 --> 09:52.362
(knock on door)
 (whispers) YOU GET IT.

09:52.362 --> 09:54.094
(sighs)

09:54.094 --> 09:56.266
(door opens)

09:56.266 --> 09:59.029
TOMMY!

09:59.029 --> 10:01.001
MOM!

10:01.001 --> 10:02.102
(laughs)

10:02.102 --> 10:05.676
(under breath) WHY COULDN'T
SHE HAVE BEEN A YAM?

10:12.182 --> 10:14.114
(laughs)

10:14.114 --> 10:15.615
OKAY, SO THIS TINA--

10:15.615 --> 10:18.248
WAS THAT THE FIRST TIME
HE CHEATED ON YOU?

10:18.248 --> 10:22.052
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
YOU HEAR STORIES.

10:22.052 --> 10:24.354
THERE WAS THIS THING
DURING THE ALL-STAR GAME--

10:24.354 --> 10:29.029
PICTURES OF DOUG IN THE TABLOIDS
WITH A COCKTAIL WAITRESS.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.702
BUT THEN HE CAME BACK
WITH A BULGARI BRACELET,

10:31.702 --> 10:34.104
SO WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT.

10:34.104 --> 10:36.106
GOD, BEING MARRIED
TO A PRO ATHLETE--

10:36.106 --> 10:38.638
IT MUST BE A NIGHTMARE.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.141
WELL, SOUNDS LIKE
YOU ARE WELL RID OF HIM.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.113
(both laugh)
 (clink)

10:43.113 --> 10:48.378
(sighs) YOU KNOW,
I FEEL LIKE YOU GET ME, GABY.

10:48.378 --> 10:52.082
AND YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE...

10:52.082 --> 10:54.154
WE'RE BOTH
EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL.

10:54.154 --> 10:59.129
GOD BLESS YOU FOR HAVING
THE COURAGE TO SAY THAT.

10:59.129 --> 11:01.131
ONLY SOMEONE
WHO LOOKS LIKE US

11:01.131 --> 11:03.894
CAN UNDERSTAND
WHAT A BURDEN IT CAN BE.

11:03.894 --> 11:06.166
ACTUALLY,
IT'S PRETTY AWESOME.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.138
(both laugh)

11:08.138 --> 11:10.841
OH, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
I DRIVE FAST ON PURPOSE

11:10.841 --> 11:13.974
JUST TO SEE IF I CAN FLIRT
MY WAY OUT OF A TICKET.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.275
AMATEUR HOUR.
 OH?

11:15.275 --> 11:18.278
I GOT A BANK MANAGER TO SHAVE
A POINT OFF OUR MORTGAGE

11:18.278 --> 11:20.981
BY BENDING OVER
TO PICK UP A PENCIL.

11:20.981 --> 11:24.184
TO THIS DAY, CARLOS CALLS IT
MY MILLION-DOLLAR ASS. (laughs)

11:24.184 --> 11:26.186
(laughs)
WAIT. I CAN TOP THAT.

11:26.186 --> 11:30.190
YESTERDAY THESE BABIES
EARNED ME A COOL $8 MILLION.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.162
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:32.162 --> 11:35.165
WELL, I WORE A LOW-CUT DRESS
TO MY SETTLEMENT HEARING,

11:35.165 --> 11:38.929
AND AFTERWARDS,
DOUG'S LAWYER CAME TO MY HOTEL

11:38.929 --> 11:40.831
TO RENEGOTIATE.

11:40.831 --> 11:43.904
YOU SLEPT WITH HIM?
YOU'RE AWFUL.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.205
I KNOW. (laughs)

11:45.205 --> 11:49.109
(sighs) I SHOULDN'T
HAVE TOLD YOU THAT.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.041
KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.

11:51.041 --> 11:53.143
OH, HONEY,
I WON'T TELL ANYONE.

11:53.143 --> 11:56.917
UM...
I DON'T KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.289
YOU'VE GOTTA GIVE ME
SOME DIRT ON YOU.

11:59.289 --> 12:01.752
(clink)

12:01.752 --> 12:03.824
HMM.

12:03.824 --> 12:07.097
HUH.

12:07.097 --> 12:09.099
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING.

12:09.099 --> 12:12.102
REALLY? NOTHING?

12:12.102 --> 12:15.265
LIKE, SAY...
PLASTIC SURGERY?

12:15.265 --> 12:16.937
WHAT?

12:16.937 --> 12:20.470
HONEY, A SCALPEL HAS NEVER
TOUCHED THIS BODY.

12:20.470 --> 12:22.172
MAYBE NOT THE BODY...

12:22.172 --> 12:24.174
(singsongy) BUT THAT NOSE
IS A DR. BROTSKI.

12:24.174 --> 12:26.917
I'D KNOW HIS WORK ANYWHERE.

12:26.917 --> 12:30.180
HOW DARE YOU.
I AM INSULTED.

12:32.052 --> 12:35.125
OKAY, FINE. I WAS 19.
IT WAS JUST A LITTLE BUMP.

12:35.125 --> 12:37.127
(laughs)
THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY.

12:37.127 --> 12:39.790
DID YOU HAVE
A DEVIATED SEPTUM, TOO?

12:39.790 --> 12:42.262
DON'T TELL ANYONE.
CARLOS KNOWS,

12:42.262 --> 12:45.295
BUT IF THE GIRLS FIND OUT,
I'D NEVER HEAR THE END OF IT.

12:45.295 --> 12:47.767
OF COURSE.
YOU CAN TRUST ME.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.069
I'M BEAUTIFUL.

12:49.069 --> 12:51.101
THAT'S TRUE.

12:51.101 --> 12:52.973
(clink)

12:52.973 --> 12:55.505
GOOD MORNING.

12:55.505 --> 12:59.779
(chuckles)
GOOD MORNING, SWEETHEART.
 MWAH.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.352
(singsongy)
STILL NOT SPEAKING TO YOU.

13:05.015 --> 13:08.889
YOUR BREAKFAST WILL BE
READY IN A MINUTE.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.321
YOU WANT COFFEE.
I'LL GET IT.

13:13.063 --> 13:15.065
YOUR SCRAMBLED EGGS
ARE READY.

13:15.065 --> 13:18.068
OH, MOM, I WAS HOPING
FOR YOUR FRENCH TOAST.

13:18.068 --> 13:20.330
SHE MADE YOU EGGS, TOM.
EAT THEM.

13:20.330 --> 13:23.033
NO, IT'S NO PROBLEM.
YOU READ YOUR PAPER,

13:23.033 --> 13:25.335
AND I'LL FIX IT RIGHT UP,
RODNEY.

13:25.335 --> 13:27.237
UH, TOMMY, MOM.

13:27.237 --> 13:29.239
OH, DIDN'T I SAY THAT?

13:29.239 --> 13:32.382
OH, IT'S JUST THAT YOU LOOK
SO MUCH LIKE YOUR FATHER.

13:32.382 --> 13:34.014
(Paige crying)

13:34.014 --> 13:35.545
OH, GOSH, WHAT NOW?

13:35.545 --> 13:37.587
OH, LET ME GET HER.

13:37.587 --> 13:40.590
IT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR.

13:40.590 --> 13:42.923
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?

13:42.923 --> 13:44.925
MY MOTHER IS ON TOP OF IT,

13:44.925 --> 13:47.928
AND YOU GET TO SIT
AND HAVE COFFEE WITH THE MAN

13:47.928 --> 13:50.460
THAT YOU KICKED THREE TIMES
"IN YOUR SLEEP" LAST NIGHT.

13:50.460 --> 13:53.163
LOOK, I CAN TAKE YOUR MOTHER
IN SMALL DOSES,

13:53.163 --> 13:56.136
BUT HER LIVING HERE
EVERY DAY--

13:56.136 --> 13:58.838
YOU KNOW, I NEVER GOT
WHAT THIS THING IS

13:58.838 --> 14:01.541
YOU HAVE WITH HER.
I MEAN, YOU SAY YOU LOVE HER.

14:01.541 --> 14:05.245
SHE'S GREAT WITH THE KIDS.
WHAT'S YOUR BEEF?
 OKAY, YOU REALLY WANNA
KNOW WHAT IT IS?

14:05.245 --> 14:08.248
YEAH.
 OKAY. I CAN'T STAND THE PERSON
SHE TURNS YOU INTO.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.549
YOU BECOME
THIS NEANDERTHAL...

14:09.549 --> 14:13.023
PFFT.
 WHILE SHE'S TRIPPING OVER
HER APRON STRINGS

14:13.023 --> 14:15.025
TO SERVE YOU.
 SO SHE LIKES TO DOTE ON ME,

14:15.025 --> 14:19.089
AND I DON'T MIND THE ATTENTION.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

14:19.089 --> 14:21.631
FALSE ALARM. SHE'S FINE.
 THANK YOU.

14:21.631 --> 14:23.633
OH, AND BY THE WAY...

14:23.633 --> 14:25.095
(singsongy) MORE COFFEE.
 YES.

14:25.095 --> 14:26.967
RIGHT AWAY.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.969
(lowered voice)
JUST KNOW IF YOU EVER

14:28.969 --> 14:30.941
HOLD YOUR COFFEE CUP
UP TO ME,

14:30.941 --> 14:34.074
YOU WILL BE TAPPING IT
WITH A STUMP.
 (clink)

14:34.074 --> 14:36.606
MMM.

14:36.606 --> 14:39.149
(indistinct conversations)

14:39.149 --> 14:42.112
MIKE. I WAS GONNA CALL YOU.
I WAS TALKING TO PAUL YOUNG.

14:42.112 --> 14:45.115
HE AND THE NEW MISSUS ARE
REALLY ENJOYING THE HOUSE.

14:45.115 --> 14:46.486
ARE THEY?

14:46.486 --> 14:49.489
YEAH, AND PAUL WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED

14:49.489 --> 14:51.191
IN SELLING THE PLACE.

14:51.191 --> 14:54.294
HE'S WILLING TO MAKE
A VERY GENEROUS OFFER.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.296
LEE, I NEVER KICKED YOUR ASS

14:56.296 --> 14:58.298
FOR RENTING OUR HOUSE
TO THAT GUY

14:58.298 --> 15:01.471
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T KNOW
OUR HISTORY, BUT NOW YOU DO.

15:01.471 --> 15:04.104
SO I GOTTA WONDER,
ARE YOU AN IDIOT?

15:04.104 --> 15:06.106
I'M SORRY.
PAUL WANTED ME TO ASK.

15:06.106 --> 15:09.009
SUSAN AND I ARE WORKING
REALLY HARD TO SAVE MONEY.

15:09.009 --> 15:12.012
YOU TELL PAUL THAT
THE DAY HIS LEASE IS UP,

15:12.012 --> 15:14.684
WE'RE MOVING HOME.
 (paper rustles)

15:14.684 --> 15:16.286
(telephone rings, beep)

15:16.286 --> 15:17.517
HELLO?

15:17.517 --> 15:20.150
HEY, IT'S ME.
I JUST RAN INTO MIKE.

15:20.150 --> 15:23.123
DID YOU ASK HIM
ABOUT THE HOUSE?
 YEAH. HE WASN'T INTERESTED.

15:23.123 --> 15:26.396
DID YOU TELL HIM I'M WILLING
TO PAY ABOVE MARKET VALUE?

15:26.396 --> 15:29.559
I COULD HAVE, BUT I DIDN'T
WANT TO GET PUNCHED.

15:29.559 --> 15:31.131
YOU DISAPPOINT ME, LEE.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.163
THERE ARE OTHER HOUSES,
PAUL.

15:33.163 --> 15:35.165
NO. I NEED THIS ONE.

15:35.165 --> 15:39.609
FORTUNATELY, I HAVE
ANOTHER WAY TO HANDLE THIS.

15:39.609 --> 15:41.541
(beep)

15:41.541 --> 15:43.543
YOUR DEPOSIT
SHOULD CLEAR MONDAY,

15:43.543 --> 15:46.416
AND THIS WILL BE
YOUR BALANCE.

15:48.378 --> 15:51.021
WAIT. THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

15:51.021 --> 15:54.524
WE SHOULD HAVE
A LOT MORE MONEY IN HERE.

15:54.524 --> 15:59.129
YES. THE SILVER BRACELET
THAT YOU CLEANED LAST YEAR

15:59.129 --> 16:02.162
THAT BELONGED TO MY GRANDMOTHER.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.164
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH?

16:07.998 --> 16:09.639
OKAY. UM...

16:09.639 --> 16:13.003
YEAH, I'LL COME BY TOMORROW.

16:13.003 --> 16:14.304
(beep)

16:17.007 --> 16:18.008
OH.
 (knocks)

16:18.008 --> 16:19.309
HEY.

16:21.151 --> 16:22.652
HEY.

16:22.652 --> 16:25.155
HI. HERE'S THAT GOLD NECKLACE
YOU LENT ME.

16:25.155 --> 16:28.318
WHAT DO YOU NEED IT FOR?
YOU GUYS GOING ON A FANCY DATE?

16:28.318 --> 16:31.321
(chuckles) NO. I JUST, UH...

16:31.321 --> 16:33.293
JUST NEEDED IT BACK.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.424
YOU OKAY?

16:34.424 --> 16:36.196
UH-HUH.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.228
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING?

16:38.228 --> 16:40.400
I CAN'T.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.403
OH. OH.
 (crying)

16:43.403 --> 16:46.406
UM... I'M GONNA--
I'M GONNA FIND YOU A TISSUE.

16:48.678 --> 16:51.241
(sniffles)

16:52.782 --> 16:54.744
SUSAN, I WAS JUST AT THE BANK.

16:54.744 --> 16:57.617
WE'RE MISSING $9,000
FROM OUR CHECKING ACCOUNT.

16:57.617 --> 17:02.792
YOU WENT TO THE BANK?
 YEAH. WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
DID YOU TAKE THAT MONEY OUT?

17:02.792 --> 17:04.154
YES. (sighs)

17:04.154 --> 17:05.395
SUSAN?

17:05.395 --> 17:07.527
SUSAN, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT MONEY?

17:07.527 --> 17:09.529
SHE LENT IT TO ME.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.531
W-WE HAD SOME BILLS
FROM PAIGE'S BIRTH

17:11.531 --> 17:14.204
THAT WEREN'T COVERED
BY INSURANCE,

17:14.204 --> 17:17.337
AND SUSAN VERY KINDLY
OFFERED TO HELP US OUT.

17:17.337 --> 17:20.510
(sighs) THAT'S RIGHT.

17:20.510 --> 17:24.144
AND SHE'S GONNA PAY IT BACK
BY... BY FRIDAY.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.415
WITH INTEREST.

17:26.675 --> 17:28.678
OR NOT... BECAUSE,
I MEAN, WE'RE FRIENDS,

17:28.678 --> 17:32.422
SO... WHY WOULD YOU
CHARGE US INTEREST?

17:36.726 --> 17:39.189
I GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK...

17:39.189 --> 17:42.362
IN CASE ANY OF
OUR OTHER FRIENDS NEED MONEY.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.097
(sighs)
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

17:47.097 --> 17:49.269
YOU'RE SO WELCOME.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.172
(sighs)

17:52.172 --> 17:54.174
ANYTHING YOU WANNA TELL ME?

17:54.174 --> 17:56.146
(sniffles) YEAH.

17:56.146 --> 17:58.748
BUT PROMISE YOU WON'T YELL?

17:58.748 --> 18:01.381
YOU DID PORN
ON THE INTERNET?!

18:01.381 --> 18:04.214
NO, IT WAS JUST CLEANING
IN LINGERIE.

18:04.214 --> 18:07.287
I--THERE--I WAS NEVER NAKED.
THERE WAS NO SEX.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.589
WELL, UNLESS THE GUYS WERE
WATCHING FOR CLEANING TIPS,

18:09.589 --> 18:13.293
IT'S PORN. SUSAN!
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?!

18:13.293 --> 18:15.795
LOOK, I FEEL BAD ENOUGH
ALREADY.

18:15.795 --> 18:19.169
WELL, YOU SHOULD! WHAT IF MIKE
FINDS OUT? OR YOUR KIDS?

18:19.169 --> 18:22.172
HEY, IT IS REALLY EASY
FOR YOU TO COME DOWN HERE

18:22.172 --> 18:25.435
FROM YOUR 5-BEDROOM HOUSE
IN THE SUBURBS AND CRITICIZE ME.

18:25.435 --> 18:27.337
I AM NOT ON WISTERIA LANE
ANYMORE.

18:27.337 --> 18:31.811
LOOK AT WHAT MIKE AND I
ARE TRYING TO CLIMB OUT OF!

18:31.811 --> 18:34.814
WE CAN'T EVEN AFFORD HOT LUNCHES
FOR M.J. AT SCHOOL,

18:34.814 --> 18:38.148
SO JUST THINK ABOUT THAT
 NEXT TIME YOU WANNA JUDGE ME.

18:38.148 --> 18:40.290
(sighs)

18:44.224 --> 18:46.226
OKAY.

18:46.226 --> 18:49.199
DONE JUDGING.
BACK TO BEING A FRIEND.

18:49.199 --> 18:51.361
(sighs)

18:51.361 --> 18:53.533
I'M SORRY
YOU HAD TO DO THAT.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.235
UGH.

18:56.866 --> 18:58.538
ME, TOO.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.150
(knock on door)

19:11.150 --> 19:13.323
(squeaks)

19:13.323 --> 19:15.355
DOUG,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:15.355 --> 19:17.487
I HAD TO SEE YOU.

19:17.487 --> 19:20.890
WELL, I'D INVITE YOU IN,
BUT IT'S LATE AND I HATE YOU.

19:20.890 --> 19:24.634
BABY, I FLEW ALL THIS WAY.
AT LEAST HEAR ME OUT.

19:24.634 --> 19:27.867
(sighs)

19:27.867 --> 19:29.899
(door squeaks)
 IF IT'S ABOUT
THE SETTLEMENT,

19:29.899 --> 19:31.901
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR BREATH.

19:31.901 --> 19:34.344
I MISS YOU.

19:34.344 --> 19:36.406
WELL, HOW DOES TINA FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

19:36.406 --> 19:39.309
THAT WAS A STUPID MISTAKE,
AND IT'S OVER.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.682
I KNOW I SCREWED UP...

19:42.682 --> 19:44.183
BIG THIS TIME.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.416
GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE.

19:46.416 --> 19:48.718
(sighs)

19:48.718 --> 19:51.891
I'M SORRY, DOUG,
BUT I'M ACTUALLY HAPPY HERE.

19:51.891 --> 19:56.266
I'M GETTING A FRESH START,
MAKING NEW FRIENDS.

19:56.266 --> 19:59.399
COME ON. CAN'T BE HAPPY
HERE IN MAYBERRY.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.571
YOU WERE MADE
FOR MANHATTAN.

20:01.571 --> 20:04.203
OH, BY THE WAY.
CARTIER CALLED.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.905
(box creaks)

20:05.905 --> 20:08.238
THEY MISS YOU, TOO.

20:08.238 --> 20:10.540
OH, DOUG,
DON'T DO THIS TO ME.

20:10.540 --> 20:13.243
THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING
WE HAD TOGETHER.

20:13.243 --> 20:15.715
I WANT IT BACK.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.287
DON'T YOU?

20:20.490 --> 20:23.553
OH, I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT THAT PLAY.

20:23.553 --> 20:26.256
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE ANGEL REPRESENTED

20:26.256 --> 20:29.529
WHEN HE FLEW DOWN IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT?

20:29.529 --> 20:33.232
I DON'T KNOW. I WAS TOO BUSY
LOOKING FOR THE WIRES.

20:34.664 --> 20:39.269
SO, ARE YOU, UH,
IN THE MOOD FOR SOME DESSERT?

20:39.269 --> 20:40.970
TOTALLY.

20:42.842 --> 20:46.316
I THINK THE ANGEL
SYMBOLIZED HOPE

20:46.316 --> 20:50.920
OR A-A SECOND CHANCE
AT REDEMPTION, PERHAPS.

20:50.920 --> 20:54.253
'COURSE, ANOTHER INTERPRETATION,
I SUPPOSE,

20:54.253 --> 20:56.356
COULD BE--

20:59.258 --> 21:01.831
(breathily) OH, MY.

21:01.831 --> 21:05.965
WHEN YOU SAID "DESSERT,"
I JUST ASSUMED...

21:05.965 --> 21:11.000
WELL, THERE'S NO TWO WAYS
TO INTERPRET THAT.

21:13.503 --> 21:15.745
OHH! (gasps)
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.

21:15.745 --> 21:18.748
WHERE DID YOU LEARN TO DO THAT,
AND WHY THE HELL AM I ASKING?

21:18.748 --> 21:20.910
DON'T TELL ME. MMM.

21:20.910 --> 21:23.413
OH, LET'S JUST SAY
YOU INSPIRE ME.

21:23.413 --> 21:24.954
MMM.

21:24.954 --> 21:27.056
OHH! (panting)

21:27.056 --> 21:28.758
WELL, THAT'LL TEACH ME

21:28.758 --> 21:31.060
TO LET YOU WALK BEHIND ME
UP THE STAIRS.

21:31.060 --> 21:33.062
(chuckles)

21:33.062 --> 21:35.765
(both moaning)

21:35.765 --> 21:37.367
WHAT IS THAT?

21:37.367 --> 21:42.071
(pants) I GUESS
INSPIRATION STRUCK AGAIN.

21:44.934 --> 21:46.305
HI.

21:46.305 --> 21:50.440
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE HERE TO STAB ME.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.412
WHAT?

21:52.412 --> 21:55.945
NOTHING. COME ON IN.

21:59.048 --> 22:01.090
(door squeaks)

22:02.852 --> 22:05.054
(panting)

22:05.054 --> 22:06.756
WHAT'S THAT?

22:06.756 --> 22:08.658
CRUDITéS.

22:08.658 --> 22:11.361
AREN'T THEY SUPPOSED TO BE
SLICED AND PEELED?

22:11.361 --> 22:12.662
I'M TOO TIRED.

22:12.662 --> 22:15.535
(gasps) PLEASE GET THAT
AWAY FROM ME.

22:15.535 --> 22:19.409
I GUESS SOMEONE
WAS WITH KEITH LAST NIGHT.

22:19.409 --> 22:22.542
WERE YOU ONCE, TWICE,
THREE TIMES NOT A LADY?

22:22.542 --> 22:25.415
IT'S NOT FUNNY.
SIX HOURS WE HAD SEX.

22:25.415 --> 22:27.417
I FEEL LIKE
THE HOLLAND TUNNEL.

22:27.417 --> 22:29.419
HONEY, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TELL HIM

22:29.419 --> 22:31.381
YOU NEED A LITTLE BREAK?
 BECAUSE HE'S YOUNG.
IF I TURN DOWN

22:31.381 --> 22:34.554
A ROLL IN THE HAY, HE'S GONNA
THINK I'M AN OLD WOMAN.

22:34.554 --> 22:37.587
YOU JUST SAID "ROLL IN THE HAY."
I THINK THAT SHIP HAS SAILED.

22:37.587 --> 22:39.729
(knock on door)

22:39.729 --> 22:42.732
OHH! WELL, I BETTER FIGURE OUT
HOW TO SLOW HIM DOWN

22:42.732 --> 22:46.696
BEFORE THIS JOHN WAYNE WALK
BECOMES PERMANENT. COMING!

22:46.696 --> 22:49.038
(door opens)

22:49.038 --> 22:50.600
HI.
 HEY. (laughs)

22:50.600 --> 22:52.602
COME ON IN.
 HEY, GIRLS.

22:52.602 --> 22:55.004
HEY!
 HEY! YOU ARE JUST IN TIME.

22:55.004 --> 22:57.847
I MIXED UP A SIGNATURE DRINK
IN HONOR OF YOUR DIVORCE.

22:57.847 --> 22:59.849
I WOULDN'T POUR THAT
JUST YET.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.083
I'M STARTING TO RETHINK
THIS WHOLE DIVORCE THING.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.115
DOUG SHOWED UP LAST NIGHT.

23:06.115 --> 23:07.817
HE FLEW IN FROM NEW YORK?

23:07.817 --> 23:12.091
I KNOW. HE SAID IT'S OVER
WITH TINA.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.923
HE WANTS ME BACK.

23:13.923 --> 23:16.866
AND HE GAVE ME THIS.

23:16.866 --> 23:18.798
(laughs)

23:18.798 --> 23:20.800
OH, DOUG SCREWS UP A LOT,

23:20.800 --> 23:23.473
BUT HIS APOLOGIES
ARE ALWAYS THE 4th OF JULY.

23:23.473 --> 23:26.636
WOW. TOM'S APOLOGIES
ARE MORE LIKE ARBOR DAY.

23:26.636 --> 23:28.978
BUT HE CHEATED ON YOU.

23:28.978 --> 23:31.981
OKAY. A GUY WHO HAS WOMEN
THROWING THEMSELVES AT HIM

23:31.981 --> 23:33.483
IN EVERY CITY.

23:33.483 --> 23:35.685
MEANWHILE,
WE HAD TEN GREAT YEARS,

23:35.685 --> 23:38.618
AND HE LOVED ME AND CARED FOR ME
AND I THINK I SHOULD

23:38.618 --> 23:40.790
GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE.

23:40.790 --> 23:42.091
AM I CRAZY?

23:42.091 --> 23:44.794
WELL, YOU HAVE INVESTED
TEN YEARS IN THE MARRIAGE.

23:44.794 --> 23:47.757
NO ONE GOES THAT LONG WITHOUT
A FEW BUMPS IN THE ROAD.

23:47.757 --> 23:50.129
OKAY, THEN. I'M DOING IT.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.001
ARE YOU INSANE?

23:52.001 --> 23:54.163
THE MAN DUMPED YOU
FOR ANOTHER WOMAN.

23:54.163 --> 23:56.766
WELL, HE APOLOGIZED.
CAN'T I FORGIVE HIM?

23:56.766 --> 23:59.068
WHY? BECAUSE HE GAVE YOU
A STUPID RING?

23:59.068 --> 24:03.012
HE'S BUYING YOU OFF AGAIN.
OPEN YOUR EYES.

24:03.012 --> 24:05.975
HEY. IT'S MY MARRIAGE ANYWAY.

24:05.975 --> 24:09.118
WHY DON'T YOU JUST KEEP
YOUR FAKE NOSE OUT OF IT?

24:15.855 --> 24:17.827
WHAT DOES SHE MEAN, FAKE?

24:17.827 --> 24:20.189
GABRIELLE SOLIS,
DID YOU HAVE A NOSE JOB?

24:20.189 --> 24:23.893
HELLO! WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT TRAMPY McTRINKET!

24:23.893 --> 24:26.736
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
OF YOU

24:26.736 --> 24:29.168
BRAGGING ABOUT
YOUR NATURAL BEAUTY?

24:29.168 --> 24:30.840
OH, I NEVER BRAG.

24:30.840 --> 24:33.142
YOU ONCE CALLED YOUR FACE
PROOF OF GOD'S EXISTENCE.

24:33.142 --> 24:35.705
YOU SAID I WAS A FRAUD
FOR WEARING A PADDED SWIMSUIT.

24:35.705 --> 24:38.978
AND NOW WE FIND OUT
YOU'VE HAD PLASTIC SURGERY.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.479
OOH! THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.081
MM-HMM.

24:42.081 --> 24:44.784
NO, IT DOESN'T.
IT WASN'T PLASTIC SURGERY.

24:44.784 --> 24:48.087
IT WAS CORRECTIVE RHINOPLASTY
FOR A DEVIATED...

24:49.789 --> 24:52.261
YOU WILL REGRET THIS.

24:52.261 --> 24:56.265
OH, GABY, COME ON!
WE'RE KIDDING!

24:56.265 --> 24:58.197
DON'T GET YOUR NOSE
OUT OF JOINT.

24:58.197 --> 25:01.701
(gasps)

25:01.701 --> 25:04.173
(door slams)
 (whispers) OHH.

25:11.981 --> 25:15.114
BREE VAN DE KAMP HAD A PROBLEM.

25:15.114 --> 25:20.019
HER BOYFRIEND'S SEXUAL APPETITE
WAS PROVING TO BE EXHAUSTING.

25:20.019 --> 25:24.754
AND THEN OUT OF THE BLUE,
BREE CAME UP WITH A SOLUTION.

25:24.754 --> 25:28.628
SINCE KEITH'S DEMANDS
WERE OVERWHELMING HER,

25:28.628 --> 25:32.131
WHY NOT MAKE
SOME OVERWHELMING DEMANDS

25:32.131 --> 25:34.163
OF HER OWN?

25:34.163 --> 25:36.305
WOW. THERE'S A LOT
OF WORK HERE.

25:36.305 --> 25:39.108
I GUESS I COULD
GET IT DONE BY FRIDAY.

25:39.108 --> 25:41.611
OH, NO, I'M GONNA NEED IT
SOONER THAN THAT.

25:41.611 --> 25:43.643
CERTAINLY... BY TONIGHT.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.149
(sighs)

25:51.681 --> 25:53.322
HEY, ALLISON MADE YOU

25:53.322 --> 25:56.155
YOUR FAVORITE COOKIES
FOR YOUR TRIP.
 MACAROONS?!

25:56.155 --> 25:57.156
OATMEAL RAISIN.

25:57.156 --> 26:00.159
OH. THOSE WERE
MY DAD'S FAVORITES.

26:00.159 --> 26:03.593
MAYBE YOU CAN TRADE THEM WITH
THE BOY NEXT TO YOU ON THE PLANE

26:03.593 --> 26:07.266
FOR HIS SNACK.
 MAKE FUN, BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,
SHE'S BEEN GREAT WITH THE BABY.

26:07.266 --> 26:10.670
SHE HAS BEEN GREAT.
YOU WERE RIGHT. I WAS WRONG.

26:10.670 --> 26:13.673
OH, IF ONLY THESE
WERE MACAROONS.

26:13.673 --> 26:16.275
THIS WOULD BE
THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.277
(laughs) OH!
 (laughs) MMM.

26:18.277 --> 26:22.151
CALL ME WHEN YOU LAND.
 SEE YOU, BABE.

26:22.151 --> 26:25.014
(door closes)
 AH. SO CAN I HELP
WITH THE LASAGNA?

26:25.014 --> 26:27.216
ACTUALLY, THE BOYS SAID
THEY WANTED MEATLOAF,

26:27.216 --> 26:29.689
SO I SWITCHED THE MENU.
NOW SIT.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.120
ALL RIGHT. (chuckles)

26:31.120 --> 26:35.024
SO TOM WAS TELLING ME ABOUT YOU
GOING BACK TO WORK. (chuckles)

26:35.024 --> 26:38.267
I MUST SAY,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

26:38.267 --> 26:40.299
WELL, THAT'S...

26:40.299 --> 26:42.301
OKAY. (chuckles)

26:42.301 --> 26:43.372
(clink)

26:43.372 --> 26:44.974
(gasps) OH!

26:44.974 --> 26:46.936
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:46.936 --> 26:50.239
I'M OUT OF MILK.
 WELL, YOUR GRANDMOTHER
IS NOT HERE TO SERVE YOU.

26:50.239 --> 26:53.182
I DON'T MIND, DEAR.
 SEE? SHE WANTS TO.

26:53.182 --> 26:56.215
SODA, GRAM?
 MAKE IT TWO.

26:56.215 --> 26:58.047
(pours milk)
 BOYS!

26:58.047 --> 27:02.852
PENNY, I HAVE TO GET THE MEAT,
SO YOU GET THE SODAS.

27:02.852 --> 27:04.854
UH... WHY?

27:04.854 --> 27:07.626
WHY? WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF OUR MEN.

27:09.258 --> 27:10.700
PENNY, SIT.

27:10.700 --> 27:13.703
YOU BOYS WANT A DRINK,
GET UP AND GET IT.

27:13.703 --> 27:15.134
THEY HAD SUCH A LONG DAY--

27:15.134 --> 27:17.306
CLASSES AND THEN
THEIR AFTER-SCHOOL SPORTS.

27:17.306 --> 27:21.210
ALLISON, IN THIS HOUSE,
THE WOMEN DON'T WAIT ON THE MEN.

27:21.210 --> 27:23.973
THE MEN GET OFF THEIR ASSES
AND HELP THEMSELVES.

27:23.973 --> 27:27.316
WHEN DID IT BECOME A SIN
TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR FAMILY?

27:27.316 --> 27:30.319
OH, YOU MODERN WOMEN.
YOU JUST PLOP OUT A BABY,

27:30.319 --> 27:33.322
AND THEN YOU CAN'T WAIT TO GET
BACK TO YOUR SILLY CAREERS.

27:33.322 --> 27:36.255
I TOOK CARE OF MY BOYS.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.257
WHEN MY HUSBAND CAME HOME,

27:38.257 --> 27:41.030
THERE WAS A HOT MEAL
WAITING FOR HIM ON THE TABLE.

27:41.030 --> 27:43.032
HE NEVER WANTED FOR ANYTHING.

27:43.032 --> 27:45.234
YEAH, AND HOW DID THAT
WORK OUT FOR YOU?

27:45.234 --> 27:47.937
HE HAD AN AFFAIR AND LEFT.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.057
DAMN IT.

28:13.222 --> 28:15.394
I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU WERE STILL HERE.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.897
HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING
THIS WHOLE TIME?

28:17.897 --> 28:21.270
YOU SAID
TO GET IT ALL DONE TODAY.

28:21.270 --> 28:23.332
SO IF THERE IS NOTHING ELSE,

28:23.332 --> 28:26.876
I WOULD LIKE TO GO HOME
AND SLIP INTO A COMA.

28:26.876 --> 28:29.208
WHY DON'T YOU SPEND
THE NIGHT HERE?

28:29.208 --> 28:31.710
I'D HATE TO SEE YOU
OUT THERE DRIVING

28:31.710 --> 28:33.813
WHEN YOU'RE SO EXHAUSTED.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.484
YOU ARE EXHAUSTED, RIGHT?

28:35.484 --> 28:37.346
TOTALLY.

28:37.346 --> 28:40.089
EVERY PART OF MY BODY HURTS.

28:40.089 --> 28:41.420
THEN STAY.
 (pats bed)

28:41.420 --> 28:43.352
SLEEP HERE.

28:43.352 --> 28:45.094
(click)

28:45.094 --> 28:47.096
IN THE MORNING,
I WILL MAKE YOU...
 (sighs deeply)

28:47.096 --> 28:48.998
BELGIAN WAFFLES.

28:48.998 --> 28:51.000
THAT WILL BE
MY SPECIAL THANK YOU

28:51.000 --> 28:53.002
FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK.

28:53.002 --> 28:54.934
(sighs)

28:54.934 --> 28:56.335
(click)

28:56.335 --> 28:59.168
MMM.

28:59.168 --> 29:01.210
HMM.

29:01.210 --> 29:03.112
MMM.

29:03.112 --> 29:05.114
(sighs)
 MMM.

29:08.217 --> 29:09.318
UH...

29:09.318 --> 29:11.180
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:11.180 --> 29:13.752
I THOUGHT OF ANOTHER WAY
YOU COULD THANK ME.

29:13.752 --> 29:17.857
YOU SAID EVERY PART
OF YOUR BODY WAS SORE.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.859
ONE PART'S DOING OKAY.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.160
OKAY!

29:22.862 --> 29:25.034
THAT'S IT!
 WHAT'S WRONG?

29:25.034 --> 29:26.535
I CAN'T DO IT!
I CAN NO LONGER KEEP UP

29:26.535 --> 29:29.338
WITH YOU AND YOUR
WOODY WOODPECKER SEX DRIVE!

29:29.338 --> 29:31.470
WHAT?
 I-I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT,
OKAY?

29:31.470 --> 29:33.172
I'M OLDER THAN YOU.

29:33.172 --> 29:36.245
I DON'T HAVE YOUR STAMINA,
AND I CAN'T KEEP UP.

29:36.245 --> 29:38.247
(chuckles) YOU--
 YOU CAN'T KEEP UP?

29:38.247 --> 29:40.349
I'M DATING A WOMAN WHO TALKS
TO WAITERS IN FRENCH

29:40.349 --> 29:43.152
AND WANTS TO DISCUSS A PLAY'S
SYMBOLISM DURING HALFTIME.

29:43.152 --> 29:46.285
INTERMISSION.
 YOU SEE? YOU'RE TEN TIMES
SMARTER THAN ME.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.287
THAT'S WHY
I KEEP SEXING YOU UP.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.219
I'M TRYING
TO KEEP YOU INTERESTED.

29:56.826 --> 30:01.800
MAKE NO MISTAKE.
I AM INTERESTED.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.835
I LOVE WHEN I AM PRATTLING ON
ABOUT THE MEANING OF THE ANGEL,

30:05.835 --> 30:07.937
YOU NOTICE THE WIRES.

30:07.937 --> 30:10.239
YOU HAVE YOUR OWN WAY
OF SEEING THE WORLD,

30:10.239 --> 30:14.083
AND IT'S FUN
AND DOWN-TO-EARTH

30:14.083 --> 30:18.087
AND EVERYTHING I'M NOT.

30:23.893 --> 30:26.926
SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU LIKE ME HOW I AM?

30:28.227 --> 30:32.261
WOW.
I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.305
YES.

30:36.305 --> 30:37.967
VERY MUCH.

30:40.509 --> 30:44.914
NOW PUT THAT THING AWAY
AND LET'S GET SOME REST.

30:58.327 --> 31:00.589
HI. WHO ARE YOU?

31:00.589 --> 31:03.362
OH, I'M JENNY.
I'M THE NEW NANNY.

31:03.362 --> 31:06.235
AH! (chuckles)
ISN'T IT GREAT?

31:06.235 --> 31:10.439
I OFFERED HER A LITTLE MORE
MONEY, AND SHE TOOK THE JOB.
 (chuckles)

31:10.439 --> 31:14.243
(lowered voice) SHE'S THE ONE
WITH THE BOOBS. REMEMBER?

31:14.243 --> 31:15.304
YEAH.

31:15.304 --> 31:17.206
(singsongy) YOU'RE WELCOME.

31:17.206 --> 31:21.250
LYNETTE, CAN I--CAN I TALK
TO YOU UPSTAIRS FOR A MINUTE?

31:21.250 --> 31:22.281
OKAY.

31:24.513 --> 31:27.086
I'LL BE RIGHT UP.

31:27.086 --> 31:29.218
OH. OKAY.

31:35.424 --> 31:37.396
SO...
 (door closes)

31:37.396 --> 31:39.398
GREAT NEWS ABOUT JEN, HUH?

31:39.398 --> 31:40.429
YEAH.

31:40.429 --> 31:42.101
I JUST FIRED HER.

31:42.101 --> 31:44.373
WHAT? YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TO DO THAT.

31:44.373 --> 31:46.375
AND YOU HAD NO RIGHT

31:46.375 --> 31:49.508
TO MAKE MY MOTHER
FEEL UNWELCOMED IN MY HOUSE.

31:49.508 --> 31:52.511
SHE JUST WANTED TO BE
A PART OF THIS FAMILY.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.683
TOM, I LOVE YOUR MOTHER,
AND IF THIS WERE 1955,

31:54.683 --> 31:57.546
I WOULD BE SO ON BOARD
WITH HER PARENTING TECHNIQUES,

31:57.546 --> 32:01.350
BUT I WILL NOT LET HER RAISE
OUR CHILDREN TO TURN OUT LIKE...

32:01.350 --> 32:04.423
WHOA, WHOA. FINISH THAT
SENTENCE. T-TURN OUT LIKE ME?

32:04.423 --> 32:06.425
NO. NO,
I DIDN'T SAY THAT! I--

32:06.425 --> 32:09.999
BUT WE--LET'S BE HONEST.
WHEN WE FIRST MET,

32:09.999 --> 32:12.301
YOU THOUGHT THERE WERE
ONLY TWO ROLES FOR WOMEN--

32:12.301 --> 32:14.463
MAKING A CAKE
OR JUMPING OUT OF ONE.

32:14.463 --> 32:18.237
I'M SORRY.
I JUST DON'T WANT HER HERE.
 FOR OUR ENTIRE MARRIAGE,

32:18.237 --> 32:20.539
YOU HAVE BEEN THE ONE
TO MAKE THE DECISIONS.

32:20.539 --> 32:23.242
"I'M GOING BACK TO WORK."
"I'M HIRING A NANNY."

32:23.242 --> 32:26.415
THIS TIME, I AM MAKING
THE DECISION. SHE STAYS.

32:28.417 --> 32:29.718
(school bell rings)

32:29.718 --> 32:32.681
OKAY, BOYS AND GIRLS, GATHER UP
YOUR SUPPLIES AND PUT THEM AWAY.

32:32.681 --> 32:35.554
(cell phone rings)
 SEE YOU TOMORROW.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.626
(ring, beep)

32:37.626 --> 32:40.289
MAXINE, I CAN'T TALK NOW.
I'M AT WORK.

32:40.289 --> 32:42.361
Look, I know I fired you,

32:42.361 --> 32:44.233
BUT IF YOU LIKE,

32:44.233 --> 32:46.295
I'M WILLING TO OFFER YOU,
UH, ANOTHER CHANCE.

32:46.295 --> 32:47.966
WHY?

32:47.966 --> 32:49.968
WELL, THIS GUY KEEPS CALLING.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.301
HE REALLY WANTS
A PRIVATE SESSION WITH YOU,

32:52.301 --> 32:55.044
AND HE'S STARTING TO OFFER
SOME SERIOUS MONEY.

32:55.044 --> 32:57.376
Come on. What do you say?

32:58.607 --> 33:01.380
HOW SERIOUS ARE WE TALKING?

33:02.751 --> 33:05.354
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING.

33:05.354 --> 33:08.417
I CANNOT TELL YOU
WHAT IT MEANS TO ME.

33:08.417 --> 33:10.419
YEAH, YEAH. ARE YOU GONNA
BE SINGING ANY SONGS

33:10.419 --> 33:12.421
ABOUT A WOMAN
WHO'S A BACKSTABBING BITCH?

33:12.421 --> 33:14.363
WE ARE REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT, EMMA.

33:14.363 --> 33:16.595
GOOD LUCK.
 THANKS.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.597
WOULD YOU GET OVER IT
ALREADY?

33:18.597 --> 33:21.030
WHY DON'T WE GO SIT DOWN
WITH OUR FRIENDS?
 NO!

33:21.030 --> 33:24.303
I'M SICK OF LYNETTE MAKING
THOSE CYRANO de BERGERAC JOKES,

33:24.303 --> 33:25.774
WHOEVER SHE WAS.

33:25.774 --> 33:28.677
HE. AND, BABY, THEY ARE
JUST TEASING YOU. (laughs)

33:28.677 --> 33:32.211
WELL, IT'S NOT FUNNY.
MY THING WAS MY NATURAL BEAUTY.

33:32.211 --> 33:35.284
LIKE SUSAN'S AN ARTIST.
LYNETTE'S A GREAT BUSINESSWOMAN.

33:35.284 --> 33:36.745
BREE'S THE PERFECT HOMEMAKER.

33:36.745 --> 33:38.747
I WAS THE BEAUTIFUL ONE.

33:38.747 --> 33:41.150
NOW I'M JUST THE PLASTIC ONE.

33:41.150 --> 33:43.592
(piano playing light jazz)

33:43.592 --> 33:47.356
AND THERE'S
THE WOMAN WHO'S TO BLAME.

33:47.356 --> 33:50.499
MAN, I'D LOVE TO SMACK
THAT SMILE RIGHT OFF HER FACE--

33:50.499 --> 33:53.232
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
HAS BEEN PULLED SO TIGHT,

33:53.232 --> 33:55.234
IT WOULD PROBABLY
SMACK ME BACK.

33:55.234 --> 33:58.337
I FORGOT WHAT IT WAS LIKE
WALKING INTO A ROOM ON YOUR ARM.

33:58.337 --> 33:59.808
(giggles) I LIKE IT.

33:59.808 --> 34:03.072

THEY WERE STARING AT.

SERIOUSLY?

39:24.793 --> 39:27.836
HE SAID WE COULD PRETEND
IT NEVER HAPPENED,

39:27.836 --> 39:29.838
AND I THOUGHT
OF ALL THE THINGS

39:29.838 --> 39:32.601
I PRETENDED NEVER HAPPENED
OVER THE YEARS.

39:32.601 --> 39:35.874
YOU WERE RIGHT, GABY.
I NEEDED TO OPEN MY EYES.

39:37.145 --> 39:39.648
OKAY, WELL,

40:55.924 --> 40:58.186
(whispers) OH. OH. OH.

41:09.938 --> 41:10.939

41:10.939 --> 41:13.572
I'm glad you put your robe on.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.844
I hate to see you
debasing yourself.

41:18.046 --> 41:19.708
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

41:19.708 --> 41:21.580
I'd like your house,

41:21.580 --> 41:24.583
and I'm willing to pay
a very fair price for it.

41:24.583 --> 41:27.986
YEAH, MIKE TOLD ME
ABOUT THAT.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.888
IT'S NOT FOR SALE.

41:29.888 --> 41:33.862
Susan, it seems to me
a lot of things are for sale--

41:33.862 --> 41:36.795
your body, your honor,

41:36.795 --> 41:38.827
your reputation.

41:38.827 --> 41:42.200
The house would seem to be
the smallest of those things.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.933
ARE YOU THREATENING ME?

41:44.933 --> 41:47.906
I'm simply saying it would
be terribly unfortunate

41:47.906 --> 41:50.839
if anyone were to find out
what I already know.

41:50.839 --> 41:54.082
I mean... (chuckles)
 I was shocked.

41:54.082 --> 41:55.584
I can only imagine

41:55.584 --> 41:58.246
what your husband and son
would think.

41:58.246 --> 42:00.549
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

42:00.549 --> 42:04.152
It's a lot to take in,
I know.

42:04.152 --> 42:07.055
Why don't you take a couple
of days to think about it?

42:07.055 --> 42:11.700
I'd hate for you to feel
that I was... pressuring you.

42:11.700 --> 42:14.032
(click)

42:17.305 --> 42:21.209

WAS WRONG.

42:21.209 --> 42:25.574
HE KNEW IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS.

42:25.574 --> 42:29.277
HE KNEW THE RISKS
IF PEOPLE FOUND OUT.

42:29.277 --> 42:34.983
BUT PAUL YOUNG WANTED TO PUNISH
THOSE WHO HAD BETRAYED HIM.

42:34.983 --> 42:39.557
SO HE HAD A PLAN THAT WOULD
SET NEIGHBOR AGAINST NEIGHBOR

42:39.557 --> 42:42.761
AND FRIEND AGAINST FRIEND.

42:42.761 --> 42:48.336
AND IT WAS A PLAN
THAT WAS GOING TO SUCCEED.
