00:13.179 --> 00:14.806
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

00:16.808 --> 00:18.393
<i>The temperature outside</i>

00:19.436 --> 00:23.356
<i>is minus 121.9 degrees Celsius.</i>

00:24.774 --> 00:29.612
<i>As we approach Chicago,</i>
<i>Mile Zero of our cycle of life,</i>

00:30.989 --> 00:32.323
<i>be prepared to brace.</i>

00:37.537 --> 00:39.330
We're all haunted by our choices,

00:41.041 --> 00:45.003
the personal choices we all made
when we boarded this train.

00:47.088 --> 00:49.758
And the collective choices
that brought us to that day.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.302
Choices made over decades,

00:53.261 --> 00:55.638
even when we knew climate change was real.

00:58.975 --> 01:03.521
And finally, my own choice
to pirate this ark...

01:04.314 --> 01:05.857
and lie to you all,

01:08.026 --> 01:09.944
which has brought us to where we are now.

01:11.780 --> 01:15.575
May we all move forward
with greater awareness

01:16.117 --> 01:17.911
of the choices that we make.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.581
<i>We are one train.</i>

01:22.832 --> 01:24.042
<i>And today,</i>

01:24.751 --> 01:26.377
that train chooses change.

01:28.129 --> 01:32.926
I hereby relinquish governance
of <i>Snowpiercer</i> to the rebel forces.

01:35.303 --> 01:37.430
These are our revolutions,

01:37.514 --> 01:42.894
994 cars long.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.671
Citizens of <i>Snowpiercer...</i>

02:12.966 --> 02:14.634
my name is Andre Layton.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.577
Okay.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.204
-Let's get to work.

02:43.997 --> 02:48.251
All right. Can you reset
lines five, four, and three for me, Javi?

02:48.334 --> 02:49.252
All right.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.423
Wow. We took a beating.

02:53.506 --> 02:54.757
No shit.

02:55.633 --> 02:59.012
So we've got 37 battery cars offline.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.097
Probably 12 hours to recharge.

03:01.180 --> 03:02.640
We're running low on juice.

03:02.724 --> 03:06.394
Before I lock myself up here full time,
there's something I need to go do.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.438
Can I help?

03:10.148 --> 03:12.692
No. You already have.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.236
It's just, um...

03:16.321 --> 03:18.489
It's something I've put off
for a long time.

03:23.202 --> 03:25.079
We paid a heavy price, Miles.

03:29.542 --> 03:30.585
Um...

03:31.753 --> 03:34.380
The Last Aussie and the guys,
they're downtrain.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.673
They wanna see you.

03:36.299 --> 03:37.842
And Mama Grande's there, too.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.056
We lost Josie, didn't we?

03:47.185 --> 03:48.353
Yeah, we did.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.029
Hey.

03:59.697 --> 04:03.076
Hey...  she loved you, Miles.

04:04.035 --> 04:08.206
Okay? She loved me, too.
She was all in for all of us.

04:09.332 --> 04:12.585
Hey, you know how a Tailie
marks a passing, right?

04:13.378 --> 04:14.254
Together.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.089
No one forgotten.

04:18.758 --> 04:19.926
No one alone.

04:20.468 --> 04:21.594
That's right.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.933
She'd have been so proud of you.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.366
Just find a way to get help.

04:43.449 --> 04:44.867
All right, I know conditions
are not ideal,

04:44.951 --> 04:46.869
but I can explain some things right now.

04:46.953 --> 04:50.123
Okay, listen up!
This is how this is going to go!

04:50.790 --> 04:56.170
The Brakemen and the rebel army
will be in charge until an elected council

04:56.254 --> 04:59.382
can create a constitution
for representative government.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.593
The rebel army is looting
and breaking into cabins!

05:02.677 --> 05:06.597
Yes! There has been some looting,
but we are in total control now.

05:07.223 --> 05:11.894
Okay? And I promise, you all have my word
that there will be no reprisals.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.647
This war is over.

05:14.731 --> 05:15.982
Now the work begins.

05:16.065 --> 05:18.443
We need to get <i>Snowpiercer </i>up and running.

05:18.526 --> 05:19.527
Ag-Sec isn't here

05:19.610 --> 05:21.863
because every single one of 'em
is guarding our food supply.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.448
-I know. I'm--
- What do you expect

05:23.531 --> 05:26.117
when you murder the security forces
who kept order?

05:26.200 --> 05:28.828
They killed us with gas!
They executed prisoners!

05:28.911 --> 05:32.123
The people need to see change,
not order, Ruth.

05:32.206 --> 05:35.209
We're not taking any arms.
We're not putting people in drawers.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.253
We look to ourselves now.

05:40.381 --> 05:43.801
All right, now, you people,
you are the leaders of the guilds.

05:43.885 --> 05:49.348
Yes, you are department heads.
You're passenger representatives.

05:49.932 --> 05:53.269
Our message to everyone right now
is very simple.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.023
This train is yours now.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.903
Tonight, we pass through Chicago,

06:04.697 --> 06:06.032
where all of this started.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.368
Mark it with your loved ones.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.497
It's a brand-new revolution.

06:15.958 --> 06:17.460
This is some bullshit.

06:21.130 --> 06:24.258
You of all people, you're supporting this.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.470
You know, this'll be a lot easier

06:27.553 --> 06:30.515
if Hospitality's paddling
in the same direction, Ruth.

06:30.598 --> 06:31.808
And which direction is that?

06:32.683 --> 06:36.270
Utopian twaddle
will never hold this train together.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.678
What's going on here? Uh, what is this?

07:09.262 --> 07:11.472
How'd you get in, Mr. Pike?

07:13.641 --> 07:17.812
I procured a custom First Class chip.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.897
They're suddenly everywhere these days.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.275
LJ, this is, uh...

07:25.361 --> 07:28.739
I don't know who these people are,
but this is Annie. Mmm-hmm.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.701
Annie. And this is Terence,
king of the janitors.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.913
- Oh, yeah! How was that, huh?

07:36.456 --> 07:40.960
Having a go in a First Class bed, right?
Now, who's next here?

07:41.043 --> 07:42.086
Yup.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.171
Okay.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.174
- I'll be next.
- You want off, I want up there.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.217
- Hey...
-No.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.802
...you see anyone you like?

07:50.720 --> 07:52.680
Maybe you can add a dick
to your collection.

07:52.763 --> 07:55.641
Get out. Please get out.

07:56.350 --> 08:00.021
My family is dead,
and I need you to leave.

08:00.104 --> 08:01.731
I need you to leave, please.

08:02.690 --> 08:03.524
Please.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.277
You should be more generous
to the resistance.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.945
You were not the resistance.

08:08.029 --> 08:11.282
You sold them out. He sold you all out.

08:13.910 --> 08:17.288
This is all my carriage now, okay?

08:17.371 --> 08:19.415
You have no friends, LJ.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.458
And these days,

08:21.501 --> 08:24.420
someone with no friends is poor.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.297
That makes me rich.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.146
What's the VHF picking up?

08:42.230 --> 08:44.232
I had a blip of that this morning.

08:44.774 --> 08:45.983
It's from the train.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.694
Music? Where is it coming from?

08:48.778 --> 08:52.990
Ag-Sec's wireless?
Or one of the ham sets downtrain?

08:53.074 --> 08:55.826
Those guys are still broadcasting?
I thought they'd given up.

08:58.287 --> 08:59.539
It's so weird.

09:19.976 --> 09:20.935
Shit.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.478
What happened?

09:23.229 --> 09:26.440
We just lost the satellite feed.
Don't worry. I'm on it.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.861
We need it back
to locate this signal.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.337
Oh.

09:48.963 --> 09:50.298
You're finally ready now.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.218
You've been avoiding this for a long time.

09:55.678 --> 09:56.804
Now I know why.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.432
<i>Snowpiercer</i> was your idea.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.518
I've done questionable things
to keep her going.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.728
You tortured people.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.896
You took their arms.

10:06.856 --> 10:11.110
And sent 147
of the last souls on Earth to death.

10:11.777 --> 10:12.987
I have to live with that.

10:13.529 --> 10:17.908
You're here because there's something
that you can't live with.

10:21.787 --> 10:22.705
Listen...

10:26.292 --> 10:27.293
Listen...

10:31.088 --> 10:32.089
Listen.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.927
Let the warm breeze bring your memory.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.847
The scent of your past.

10:41.807 --> 10:42.850
Dark earth,

10:43.934 --> 10:47.813
wet rocks and tall grass.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.234
Remember when life...

10:54.779 --> 10:56.197
was everywhere you looked,

10:56.822 --> 10:57.990
everywhere you walked.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.702
It cradled you, fed your wonder,

11:02.953 --> 11:04.705
made you who you are.

11:05.581 --> 11:06.832
Now,

11:07.500 --> 11:09.085
hear<i> Snowpiercer.</i>

11:11.921 --> 11:14.298
- <i>Feel the track.</i>

11:21.389 --> 11:22.473
<i>Metal on metal.</i>

11:26.268 --> 11:28.396
<i>The flow of your Engine Eternal.</i>

11:32.650 --> 11:37.363
<i>Her veins bringing power</i>
<i>to everything that's still alive. </i>

11:53.295 --> 11:54.296
In your mind,

11:54.964 --> 11:57.842
a door opens on another door opening.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.808
You're stepping into yourself,

12:07.810 --> 12:08.936
stepping deeper.

12:10.771 --> 12:11.981
You're going deeper...

12:14.150 --> 12:15.443
until finally...

12:18.904 --> 12:22.575
<i>♪ I've got your picture ♪</i>

12:23.367 --> 12:26.579
<i>♪ That you gave to me ♪</i>

12:27.163 --> 12:29.915
<i>♪ And it's signed with love ♪</i>

12:30.458 --> 12:32.668
<i>♪ Just like it used to be ♪</i>

12:32.751 --> 12:34.086
Alexandra.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.797
<i>♪ The only thing different ♪</i>

12:38.048 --> 12:41.051
<i>♪ The only thing new ♪</i>

12:42.178 --> 12:44.889
<i>♪ I've got your picture ♪</i>

12:48.726 --> 12:50.269
- What is it?

12:53.063 --> 12:54.273
What is it?

12:55.357 --> 12:56.442
My daughter...

12:56.525 --> 12:57.776
My daughter...

13:00.070 --> 13:02.490
<i>I sacrificed my daughter for this train. </i>

13:05.618 --> 13:07.369
<i>I put my work first.</i>

13:09.955 --> 13:11.999
Even at the end, I didn't stop.

13:12.708 --> 13:16.504
I didn't go to her,
so certain that they'd be there.

13:19.715 --> 13:20.716
But then...

13:23.093 --> 13:24.803
then the train was leaving...

13:25.304 --> 13:26.138
and...

13:27.431 --> 13:28.641
and they weren't.

13:30.684 --> 13:31.602
And...

13:33.103 --> 13:34.939
I stayed with the train.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.320
Go further.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.322
If Alex was here...

13:46.450 --> 13:48.160
<i>what would you want to say to her?</i>

13:56.460 --> 13:57.586
I miss you.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.090
I miss you.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.095
I need you.

14:08.764 --> 14:09.765
And...

14:11.934 --> 14:15.062
put your hand on my cheek.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.032
I am so sorry.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.584
I would give anything
just to hold you again.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.675
I'm sorry.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.012
I'm sorry.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.191
I'm sorry.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.367
She looks like a...

15:10.451 --> 15:12.828
I don't know. Like a constellation.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.121
You think it's a she?

15:14.830 --> 15:18.292
I didn't think. I just... said it. You?

15:19.752 --> 15:20.669
Boy.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.463
So that's how
this is gonna go, huh?

15:23.130 --> 15:25.007
Yeah.

15:25.633 --> 15:26.675
I guess so.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.972
It's not about us anymore.

15:33.807 --> 15:37.478
We're not important.
It's about her... now.

15:38.437 --> 15:39.438
Yeah.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.775
-Or him.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.819
So how do we do this?

15:46.654 --> 15:48.238
After everything.

15:50.616 --> 15:51.617
After Josie.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.253
We're never gonna be
the family we dreamed of.

16:04.546 --> 16:05.881
But we'll find a way.

16:15.516 --> 16:19.395
They raided Poultry, damaged Aquaculture,
stole half a car of lettuce.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.854
They're taking anything they want.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.815
Now I have serious supply chain issues,

16:22.898 --> 16:25.025
and you want the whole train
to have equal calories?

16:25.109 --> 16:28.070
-That's your first priority.
-We're down 16 trained men.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.197
We're going on 48 hours no sleep--

16:30.280 --> 16:32.199
Thank you for your efforts, Jinju.

16:32.282 --> 16:33.826
Okay, this where I go

16:33.909 --> 16:36.912
and I let you two discuss
your supply chain issues.

16:43.377 --> 16:46.755
I don't understand how you could keep
such a big lie from me!

16:46.839 --> 16:48.090
And the whole train.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.758
Because this is the alternative.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.928
And if the people needed a Wilford,
why deny them that hope?

16:54.096 --> 16:55.347
Come on, Till.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.308
Would you really rather be alone?

17:03.188 --> 17:04.690
I'm not alone.

17:05.774 --> 17:09.194
I've got my sisters and brothers
I stood with

17:09.278 --> 17:12.990
and a responsibility to <i>Snowpiercer</i>
I have never felt before.

17:15.784 --> 17:17.369
So we finally agree...

17:18.495 --> 17:20.372
the train comes first.

17:41.351 --> 17:45.898
You know what they say
when you break up on <i>Snowpiercer?</i>

17:48.275 --> 17:49.401
See you around.

18:59.054 --> 19:00.556
So you've come to abdicate?

19:01.140 --> 19:02.307
You look ready.

19:03.559 --> 19:04.893
Ready for what?

19:05.477 --> 19:08.856
Anarchy? Chaos in the corridors?

19:08.939 --> 19:12.693
Frozen bodies stacked up like sardines
because Compost can't keep up?

19:12.776 --> 19:15.070
While you just swan off to the Engine,

19:16.196 --> 19:18.407
hide from everything that you've wrought?

19:18.490 --> 19:20.450
Oh, yeah, leave me here with these...

19:21.702 --> 19:23.787
people.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.958
Andre Layton's council of representatives.

19:28.041 --> 19:30.752
-It's a clean slate, Ruth.
-It's never gonna work.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.212
Democracy used to work.

19:36.049 --> 19:38.719
Sometimes you have to lose something
to find it again.

19:41.513 --> 19:45.475
You put 147 people out there to die.

19:46.393 --> 19:50.230
Many of them my friends,
including Nolan Grey.

19:52.316 --> 19:53.150
Well...

19:55.861 --> 19:57.696
survival doesn't need love, does it?

20:02.284 --> 20:03.785
That's what I got so wrong.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.208
There's nothing more important than love.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.141
I'll see you around, Ruth.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.227
We've already said our goodbyes.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.595
- Triangulating it?
- I'm trying.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.889
Ben, the signal's reading
to the northwest.

21:07.307 --> 21:10.852
Northwest? Come on, Javi,
there's nothing out there.

21:21.571 --> 21:23.407
Hey. I'm back.

21:24.324 --> 21:25.742
That's a good look on you.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.536
Thank you very much.

21:28.328 --> 21:31.999
Okay. So, we're passing through
Chicago at 1930,

21:32.082 --> 21:34.042
slowing her down as usual
to mark Mile Zero.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.294
Mel, Mel...

21:36.253 --> 21:37.212
Listen to this.

21:40.799 --> 21:41.633
Music?

21:42.384 --> 21:46.263
If that old radio picked it up,
it's probably just something from us.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.765
Guys, listen to me.
It's coming from the northwest.

21:49.641 --> 21:50.475
Outside.

21:50.559 --> 21:51.643
Outside?

21:53.312 --> 21:54.187
Jesus.

21:56.565 --> 21:57.774
Survivors?

22:01.611 --> 22:06.199
Our receiver's range is what?
80 kilometers? Max?

22:06.283 --> 22:08.285
Ben, what's out there?

22:08.368 --> 22:09.619
Satellite link's down.

22:10.203 --> 22:12.247
-I'm working on it.
- Damn it.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.667
Directional antenna froze, too.
I can't get a second point to triangulate.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.919
-Seriously?
-I'm on it, Mel. I'm on it.

22:18.754 --> 22:22.799
But that signal is still getting stronger.
That means we're getting closer.

22:23.425 --> 22:26.178
If we don't slow down,
we're gonna be out of range in no time.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.222
I'm gonna get Layton up here.

22:29.806 --> 22:32.476
-Mel, we don't need to go through Layton.
-Yes, Ben, we do.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.146
It's a new train.
It's a new chain of command.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.023
Excuse me, Mr. Layton.

22:38.648 --> 22:41.526
I caught these two trying to smuggle
a cart full of lettuce uptrain.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.070
The cart was just there, boss.

22:43.153 --> 22:45.697
Hey, look. Don't give me that shit.
Where were you taking it?

22:48.784 --> 22:50.494
Pike's set up in First.

22:50.577 --> 22:52.412
-He's fencing stuff.
-Pike.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.039
A rogue Tailie, imagine that.

22:54.122 --> 22:54.956
-Yeah.

22:55.040 --> 22:58.376
<i>Andre Layton to the Engine.</i>
<i>Andre Layton to the Engine, immediately.</i>

22:58.460 --> 22:59.294
Now what?

22:59.920 --> 23:03.090
-I don't know. Put 'em in lockup, okay?
- The lockups are full, sir.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.926
Well, do something
and keep order until I get back.

23:06.718 --> 23:07.928
Lettuce...

23:09.513 --> 23:10.347
Order.

23:10.430 --> 23:12.349
It's got a familiar ring to it,
doesn't it?

23:13.016 --> 23:14.851
All right, let's go, bunny rabbits.

23:15.769 --> 23:16.728
Let's go!

23:18.438 --> 23:20.857
Survivors? Is that even possible?

23:20.941 --> 23:25.445
Maybe. But it's been six and a half years
since we've had a radio contact.

23:25.529 --> 23:30.492
Damn. Who could hold out like that?
Military? A private bunker?

23:30.575 --> 23:33.078
It's gotta be an old tower.
A loop. Some sort of backup.

23:33.161 --> 23:34.913
Why haven't we heard it before?

23:34.996 --> 23:37.249
Because we never use the radio.
There's no one to talk to.

23:37.332 --> 23:39.376
-Where's our sat pic, Ben?
-Working on it.

23:39.459 --> 23:41.878
We can't pinpoint it,
but the signal keeps getting stronger.

23:43.088 --> 23:43.922
Ben?

23:44.005 --> 23:45.799
Come in. This is <i>Snowpiercer.</i>
Do you copy?

23:45.882 --> 23:48.176
-We need more time, Mel.
-Well, we're running out of that.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.594
Do you copy? I repeat.

23:49.678 --> 23:51.680
Then let's slow further.
Let's try and get a visual.

23:54.224 --> 23:55.225
Here's the call.

23:56.184 --> 23:59.104
If we take speed off,
we'll be in deficit...

23:59.771 --> 24:02.023
using more power than we can generate.

24:02.107 --> 24:06.236
We're already near emergency reserves,
and we want to slow to go through Chicago.

24:07.362 --> 24:09.656
Now, on the other hand,

24:10.323 --> 24:13.076
if we race past this signal
without pinpointing it,

24:13.660 --> 24:16.580
it'll be a full revolution
before we can hear it again.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.961
If there's a possibility
of other survivors...

24:23.753 --> 24:24.963
that we're not alone...

24:25.881 --> 24:27.382
we have to make contact.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.803
Agreed. Slowing the train.

24:38.435 --> 24:39.436
Sorry.

24:41.688 --> 24:42.939
Get off of me!

24:45.817 --> 24:49.112
- Oh! Bloody hell!
- Hey, hey, easy.

24:50.197 --> 24:51.907
Take a crack at the other one at least.

24:51.990 --> 24:52.824
What?

24:54.034 --> 24:56.161
Oh. I'm sorry.

24:57.621 --> 25:00.123
Sorry. Just...

25:00.832 --> 25:03.460
I've lost everything,
and my whole world is gone.

25:04.044 --> 25:06.171
And everyone hates me.

25:06.254 --> 25:08.048
Don't worry. Everyone hates me, too.

25:11.009 --> 25:12.177
I know who you are.

25:12.886 --> 25:14.179
Are we good?

25:17.515 --> 25:19.392
Tailies threw me out of First.

25:20.310 --> 25:21.394
And no one would help me.

25:21.978 --> 25:24.689
And I don't even have
anything left to trade except...

25:25.899 --> 25:27.108
Oh...

25:28.026 --> 25:30.278
That's not nothing. Look.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.115
I stole it from the mess hall.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.869
But how are we even
supposed to take the skin off?

25:40.789 --> 25:42.540
You don't know how to peel an egg?

25:44.751 --> 25:47.003
That's funny.

25:47.921 --> 25:48.964
Come on, let me show you.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.675
Come on, love. You're all right.

25:52.217 --> 25:53.718
I'm a bad egg, too.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.411
Signal's peaking.
We should be almost on top of it.

26:24.499 --> 26:26.084
Should have visual any second now.

26:34.259 --> 26:35.135
Oh, my God.

26:42.892 --> 26:44.936
- Everybody... Please...

26:46.062 --> 26:47.522
Ruth! Ruth!

26:48.565 --> 26:50.025
There's another train out there.

26:50.608 --> 26:53.528
Ruth. Ruth, what's happening?
Are there other people alive?

26:53.611 --> 26:56.114
- Excuse me!
-Ruth, are there people alive out there?

26:56.656 --> 26:58.450
- Yes, there.
-Look!

26:59.409 --> 27:01.369
Oh, sweet jiminy.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.579
He's running the supply train.

27:02.662 --> 27:04.122
You don't know it's him, Mel.

27:04.205 --> 27:06.249
Wait. There's a supply train?

27:06.333 --> 27:07.834
-It's <i>Big Alice.</i>
-Who?

27:08.460 --> 27:09.919
<i>Big Alice.</i> She's a prototype engine.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.880
- Melanie.
-I'm going to full speed.

27:11.963 --> 27:13.089
-Give me everything we have.
- I will.

27:13.173 --> 27:16.968
The spur connects, Mel. Whoever it is,
they're gonna switch in behind us.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.139
- Oh.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.100
It's him.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.936
It's him. Oh!

27:27.020 --> 27:29.105
Melanie, talk to me.

27:29.189 --> 27:30.357
He's gonna try and board us.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.983
-You don't know it's him, Mel.
-Who else, Ben?

27:32.067 --> 27:33.777
Another merry band of ark pirates?

27:33.860 --> 27:35.528
-What are you talking--
- Do you mean Wilford?

27:35.612 --> 27:40.367
Yes. Mr. Wilford is back!
Everybody just stay calm. Stay calm.

27:45.288 --> 27:46.956
If Wilford does board us,

27:47.040 --> 27:50.293
we're in for something far worse
than anything we've just come through.

27:50.377 --> 27:53.880
Then I'll get a war party downtrain
to make sure that doesn't happen.

27:55.048 --> 27:56.049
Layton.

27:56.132 --> 27:59.177
When the passengers realize it's him,
they'll be divided.

27:59.260 --> 28:00.887
I can keep us together.

28:01.596 --> 28:02.597
You have to.

28:06.559 --> 28:08.520
Ruth, stop.
We just confirmed that he was dead.

28:08.603 --> 28:09.604
It's not possible.

28:09.687 --> 28:11.564
Who else could survive, eh?

28:11.648 --> 28:13.274
Huh? Answer me that.

28:14.150 --> 28:17.320
He's back to save us
from these bloody rebels.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.990
Tristan, we're gonna need
a greeting party.

28:21.074 --> 28:22.075
Greeting party?

28:22.617 --> 28:24.285
Oh, no. Is that not the protocol?

28:24.369 --> 28:27.205
Oh, I can't remember.
Never mind. We'll make do.

28:28.206 --> 28:31.668
You tidy yourself up.
We're going to the Tail.

28:31.751 --> 28:32.752
Yes, ma'am.

28:45.265 --> 28:47.726
Mel, we're pulling way too much
from the banks.

28:47.809 --> 28:48.893
What's our distance?

28:48.977 --> 28:50.311
Shit.
She's gonna dock with the Tail.

28:50.395 --> 28:51.896
That's why they're hitting the brakes.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.232
Damn it. What is he doing back?

28:54.315 --> 28:55.817
Mel, you have to consider the outcomes.

28:55.900 --> 28:59.154
<i>Alice</i> is a big train.
Forty cars is nothing for her.

28:59.237 --> 29:01.614
But she's low torqued. We can outrun him.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.783
- The math says he'll catch us.
-Then look again.

29:03.867 --> 29:07.036
I need every amp you can find, Javi.
From Ag-Sec, from anywhere.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.830
- Come on, Mel.
-Just try.

29:09.456 --> 29:11.916
-We have to try.
- Nearly at the switch.

29:12.625 --> 29:15.420
Wow. He's coming in behind us.

29:16.045 --> 29:18.590
Come on, guys!
You're missing out on world events here!

29:18.673 --> 29:20.925
All right, party's over.
Get out of here. Go.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.303
-Come on out!
- Clear out!

29:23.386 --> 29:24.387
Okay, I'm going.

29:24.471 --> 29:25.680
-You, sit down.
- Go. Get out of here.

29:26.473 --> 29:27.474
Come on!

29:30.101 --> 29:32.187
- Okay.
-Don't you just love democracy?

29:32.270 --> 29:35.023
You gotta participate
in a democracy, Pike.

29:35.106 --> 29:36.691
Come on, now's your chance.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.568
Is it who I think it is behind us?

29:38.651 --> 29:41.362
Well, if it is, then all of this
might be over before it even starts.

29:41.446 --> 29:44.616
So come on, I need everybody
united together against a common enemy.

29:44.699 --> 29:48.119
Layton, why do you gotta always ask me
to be a better man?

29:48.203 --> 29:49.662
-Get him up.
-Let's go.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.456
It's all right. God damn this train.

29:51.539 --> 29:53.875
You know, I was just starting
to have some fun here.

29:53.958 --> 29:56.169
-We're coming too hot to go into Chicago.

29:56.252 --> 29:57.504
Reserves at emergency!

29:57.587 --> 29:59.464
If we dry out, it's over.
I'm pulling her back.

29:59.547 --> 30:01.674
No! That's an order!

30:13.228 --> 30:15.313
Wilford! Wilford! Wilford!

30:15.396 --> 30:18.858
It's right behind us.
It almost took off the bloody Tail.

30:19.818 --> 30:23.488
Hey! Break it up! Break it up!
Break it up! It's an emergency!

30:23.571 --> 30:25.657
Come on, Layton. How can Wilford be back?

30:25.740 --> 30:28.451
Whoever it is, they are boarding us, okay?

30:28.535 --> 30:31.746
Our Tail! Now I got 15 Brakemen.
I need more soldiers.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.874
- What are we waiting for? Let's go.
-Okay! Everybody else, you know the drill.

30:34.958 --> 30:37.836
Barricades above and below.
Be ready to weld the doors. On me.

30:37.919 --> 30:39.337
-To the Tail!
- Let's go.

30:45.051 --> 30:49.389
Come on, girl. Just keep your distance.
Come on.

30:50.849 --> 30:51.850
Come on.

30:53.726 --> 30:54.727
Come on.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.675
- Winnie, be careful.

31:58.666 --> 32:00.919
Come on, then, guys.
They're trying to uplink.

32:01.002 --> 32:03.880
They're hacking in.
He'll seize the system.

32:03.963 --> 32:05.590
He'll seize the Engine.
He's slowing us down.

32:05.673 --> 32:07.342
Taking noncritical systems offline.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.385
We gotta go outside.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.095
Come on, that's crazy.

32:11.179 --> 32:13.973
We gotta cut the uplink.
Javi, can you hold him off?

32:14.057 --> 32:15.391
-Not for long, Mel.
- Okay.

32:15.475 --> 32:17.769
Then we better hurry.
You have the train. Let's go.

32:29.697 --> 32:31.199
You guys fall back now, okay?

32:31.950 --> 32:35.328
-That won't take long.
-These bunks, back 'em up, all right?

32:35.411 --> 32:36.663
We're gonna need space.

32:38.373 --> 32:42.293
<i>♪ Lift up your hearts</i>
<i>And give praise with our song ♪</i>

32:42.377 --> 32:46.297
<i>♪ For Mr. Wilford</i>
<i>Our cry will be strong ♪</i>

32:47.173 --> 32:51.469
<i>♪ Rising above</i>
<i>Your mind's aim is true ♪</i>

32:51.552 --> 32:55.890
<i>♪ Cheer and rejoice</i>
<i>For we honor you ♪</i>

32:55.974 --> 33:00.728
<i>♪ Lift up your voice</i>
<i>Though the path may be long ♪</i>

33:00.812 --> 33:02.855
Ruth. Ruth!

33:04.607 --> 33:05.858
Ruth, cut the crap!

33:05.942 --> 33:09.779
-I am here officially, Mr. Roche.

33:09.862 --> 33:12.740
Hospitality leads the welcoming party,
as per protocol.

33:12.824 --> 33:16.160
We are in a military situation here, Ruth.
You gotta get these kids out of here.

33:16.244 --> 33:18.454
They are breaching the goddamn train!

33:21.749 --> 33:24.043
Whoa! Hey! Back up! Back up!
Everybody back.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.753
I'm a dignitary.

33:26.921 --> 33:28.089
Yeah, I feel that.

33:28.715 --> 33:32.468
Nolan Grey would have been here
in his full dress uniform.

33:32.552 --> 33:37.181
And I would have been right beside him,
because my uniform says peace.

33:37.265 --> 33:41.519
Now this may be
your democratic experiment, Mr. Layton.

33:42.645 --> 33:47.775
But I am Head of Hospitality,
and teal is the color of diplomacy.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.655
Weapons down.
Everybody put your weapons down.

33:52.739 --> 33:53.948
Put 'em down.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.868
You're right. You're right.

33:56.951 --> 34:00.413
Diplomacy first, right?
Nobody wants another war.

34:02.832 --> 34:06.210
When that door opens,
I want you right by my side.

34:06.294 --> 34:10.381
I need you there ready to parley,
with a show of force to back us up.

34:11.758 --> 34:12.592
Agreed?

34:15.219 --> 34:17.972
I want to be right up there in the front.

34:18.681 --> 34:21.350
And I want to be the first one
to shake his hand.

34:21.434 --> 34:23.936
Yes, it has to be you.

34:25.271 --> 34:26.481
Give him the gun, Ruth.

34:30.193 --> 34:32.195
Okay. All right.
Get these kids somewhere safe.

34:32.278 --> 34:34.363
Ruth, come up front with me.

34:38.785 --> 34:41.913
Okay, we pop the top, hook in
and make our way to the Tail.

34:41.996 --> 34:43.581
Then we cut the uplink by hand.

34:43.664 --> 34:45.333
It's a haywire plan, Mel.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.376
Yeah, well, you got a better one?

34:48.169 --> 34:51.047
Because he's gonna peel off our speed
and freeze us out.

34:52.465 --> 34:54.759
Then maybe we have to stand down.

34:57.053 --> 34:58.137
Come on.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.348
Have you thought about
what's on that supply train?

35:01.724 --> 35:04.477
-Yeah, I have.
-Because we need her, Mel.

35:05.770 --> 35:08.439
<i>Snowpiercer</i> is coming apart. You know it.

35:09.023 --> 35:12.610
There is no perpetual motion
because there are no perpetual parts.

35:12.693 --> 35:14.737
But that supply train is packed.

35:15.321 --> 35:19.242
Bogie motors, bovine cultures,
a full genetics lab.

35:19.325 --> 35:21.160
Enough to keep us going.

35:21.744 --> 35:23.121
How do you know it's still there?

35:23.704 --> 35:26.290
It's been almost seven years.
How do you know what's left?

35:26.374 --> 35:29.961
Or what kind of society they've made?
Or what kind of diseases they carry?

35:30.044 --> 35:31.754
And even if they have
everything that we need,

35:31.838 --> 35:33.422
what'll he want in return?

35:38.678 --> 35:39.846
You knew he was there.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.099
-I knew you would run.
-How long did you know?

35:43.182 --> 35:46.185
I saw them on the satellite this morning,
but I knew it was him right away.

35:46.269 --> 35:47.478
-So you killed the feed.
-Yeah.

35:47.562 --> 35:49.522
You steered us right into him!

35:49.605 --> 35:52.066
We could have evaded,
and more importantly,

35:52.150 --> 35:54.610
you and I could have made
that choice together.

35:58.698 --> 36:00.199
You made a unilateral move.

36:01.450 --> 36:02.493
Here's mine.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.706
The hell, Mel?

36:06.789 --> 36:08.958
I will not put my faith in Wilford again.

36:09.041 --> 36:11.294
So I am going out there to free the helm.

36:11.377 --> 36:13.129
And one way or another...

36:14.255 --> 36:16.966
you're gonna keep this ark going
when I'm gone.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.761
-Don't do this, Mel.
-You let me go.

36:56.714 --> 36:58.299
I'll see you on the other side.

38:21.090 --> 38:23.009
<i>Javi, she went out alone.</i>

38:24.010 --> 38:25.094
<i>I couldn't stop her.</i>

39:23.944 --> 39:24.945
Brakes.

39:48.761 --> 39:50.262
Why have we stopped?

39:57.144 --> 39:58.229
We stopped.

40:08.989 --> 40:10.282
How long have we got?

40:10.366 --> 40:11.909
Ten minutes, give or take.

40:17.206 --> 40:22.128
<i>Snowpiercer,</i> no matter
who is on the other side of that door,

40:22.211 --> 40:23.587
remember this...

40:24.505 --> 40:27.341
-Wilford was only ever a man.
-A great man.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.261
Do not build him up in your minds
into something he isn't.

40:30.344 --> 40:33.347
He is not your engineer.
This is not his train.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.307
I think you'll find that it is.

40:35.891 --> 40:38.144
<i>Snowpiercer</i> is ours!

40:38.227 --> 40:40.354
-She belongs to her citizens!
- Yeah.

41:38.746 --> 41:39.788
Who are you?

41:40.581 --> 41:41.916
We need to get our train moving.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.918
Greetings from <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

41:44.001 --> 41:45.586
Is Mr. Wilford aboard?

41:45.669 --> 41:47.963
Mr. Wilford has already seized
control of your engine.

41:48.547 --> 41:51.133
You have about 13 minutes
to agree to a peaceful surrender

41:51.217 --> 41:53.761
before the cold overcomes
and you all freeze to death.

41:55.387 --> 41:57.097
Tell him we need to see him face-to-face.

41:57.181 --> 42:00.476
Please, yes.
And that we welcome him aboard.

42:00.559 --> 42:01.977
-You're Hospitality?
- I am, yes.

42:02.061 --> 42:05.523
My name's Ruth Wardall, at your service.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.903
Is Melanie Cavill alive?

42:12.738 --> 42:14.490
Yes. Yes, she is.

42:16.033 --> 42:17.159
Who are you?

42:21.455 --> 42:23.123
My name is Alexandra Cavill.

42:28.337 --> 42:29.213
Alexandra?

42:33.467 --> 42:34.677
Where is my mother?
