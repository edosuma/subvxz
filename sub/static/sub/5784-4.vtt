WEBVTT

00:02.035 --> 00:05.104
(theme music)

00:47.547 --> 00:50.149
- Tommy!

00:50.151 --> 00:53.252
Tommy?

00:55.522 --> 00:57.723
Tommy Baker, have you not
heard me calling you?

00:57.725 --> 01:00.692
We're already late
getting back--

01:04.798 --> 01:07.900
Oh, for the love of God.

01:10.870 --> 01:12.871
(whispering): You're going to
get it when you get home.

01:12.873 --> 01:16.975
- People, I need to you stay
back and stay calm.

01:16.977 --> 01:20.012
There's really nothing to...
nothing to see here.

01:20.014 --> 01:22.081
Just stay back.

01:22.083 --> 01:24.083
- Where did the statue
come from?

01:24.085 --> 01:26.518
- No one knows. It certainly
wasn't commissioned.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.655
- A nude not commissioned
by our city fathers --

01:29.657 --> 01:31.657
why am I not surprised?

01:31.659 --> 01:34.860
I must say it's very good.
She looks almost real.

01:34.862 --> 01:37.229
- Yes, well, perhaps she should
be in a gallery

01:37.231 --> 01:40.632
where the craftsmanship can be
more fully appreciated.

01:40.634 --> 01:44.136
- Craftsmanship... William, say
what you really mean.

01:44.138 --> 01:46.371
She's bare-naked in a city park.

01:46.373 --> 01:48.373
It's a civil outrage.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.409
- ...which you seem to be
thoroughly enjoying.

01:50.411 --> 01:53.879
- I certainly am. A stir is
clearly what the artist
intended.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.014
- Sir! Sir, get back here!

01:56.016 --> 01:59.017
- This vulgar display is an
affront to decency!

01:59.019 --> 02:02.988
- Sir! Sir! Give me that!

02:02.990 --> 02:05.324
Oh, my God.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.993
Sir. Doctor.

02:07.995 --> 02:09.995
- What is it, George?

02:09.997 --> 02:12.998
- I believe this is no ordinary
work of art.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.601
- No wonder she was so lifelike.

02:21.241 --> 02:24.776
(camera shutter)
- Electroplated...

02:24.778 --> 02:26.845
so she was covered in metal
like a trophy?

02:26.847 --> 02:30.449
- (Murdoch): Yes, sir.
- That's a new one.

02:30.451 --> 02:34.219
- It certainly is. There must be
a logical explanation.

02:34.221 --> 02:37.756
- I don't think you'll find much
logic in this business, Murdoch.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.859
- I am rather pleased my first
case back in the morgue

02:40.861 --> 02:43.195
is something so unique.

02:43.197 --> 02:45.264
(squishing)

02:45.266 --> 02:47.266
- (Thomas): Crikey.

02:47.268 --> 02:50.636
- It's extraordinary.
She's been perfectly preserved.

02:50.638 --> 02:53.906
- Why cover her in wax?
- It likely has to do

02:53.908 --> 02:58.110
with the electroplating process.
I did read about a patent

02:58.112 --> 03:01.713
for electroplating corpses
issued in France some years ago.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.883
- We'd all be better
off if they stuck to wine,
cheese and bloody frog's legs.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.853
- The waxy substance likely
contains pulverized nitrate

03:07.855 --> 03:11.823
of silver. The body is then
immersed in copper sulphate

03:11.825 --> 03:13.992
and the electrical current
is applied.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.728
- The result is a metallic
mummy, as it were.

03:16.730 --> 03:20.032
- Well, sirs, perhaps this is
some sort of publicity stunt.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.701
An advertisement, as it were,
to promote a novel,

03:22.703 --> 03:24.970
new way to remember
your loved ones.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.606
Cast them in metal; preserve
them for all of eternity.

03:27.608 --> 03:30.275
Perhaps put some
clothes on them...

03:30.277 --> 03:32.911
- Crabtree, stop being
such a happy dafty.

03:32.913 --> 03:35.180
So this is no amateur job,
Murdoch.

03:35.182 --> 03:38.850
- No, it's not. George, were you
able to find any information

03:38.852 --> 03:41.320
on electroplating facilities?
- Yes, sir. There's only one

03:41.322 --> 03:43.689
electroplating factory in
Toronto. We actually had cause

03:43.691 --> 03:46.124
to visit there on another case
some years ago.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.126
You may recall the name

03:48.128 --> 03:51.363
of the factory owner
was James Kirkham.

03:51.365 --> 03:55.267
- Right, Doctor, we'll leave you
to figure out how the girl died.

03:55.269 --> 03:59.137
- It could be natural causes.
- I know. It's never murder
until it's murder.

03:59.139 --> 04:02.841
Gentlemen.

04:05.111 --> 04:08.780
(chain clinking)
(splashing)

04:25.398 --> 04:27.399
- As you can see, this process

04:27.401 --> 04:29.735
can't be done
on organic material,

04:29.737 --> 04:31.737
certainly not on a human body.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.739
- My detective thinks otherwise,
Mr. Kirkham.

04:33.741 --> 04:36.575
- Well, think all you want. I'm
telling you it can't be done.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.877
- Perhaps you would care to see
what's in our morgue.

04:38.879 --> 04:43.015
- What if the body was coated in
silver nitrate?

04:43.017 --> 04:45.484
- That would interact with the
ions in the copper bath,

04:45.486 --> 04:48.153
chemically speaking.
- Then the copper would
adhere to the silver.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.656
- Yes.
- So it is possible.

04:50.658 --> 04:53.025
- I've just said
it's chemically possible.

04:53.027 --> 04:56.094
- I remind you this is a police
investigation, Mr. Kirkham.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.830
- Who has access to this plant?

04:58.832 --> 05:01.199
- That would be the men
who work here.

05:01.201 --> 05:04.603
- Do you employ
a night watchman?
- No, none of this equipment

05:04.605 --> 05:06.571
is easy to pilfer.

05:06.573 --> 05:09.074
I'd prefer

05:09.076 --> 05:13.612
the Constabulary not suggest
anything untoward happened here.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.814
I don't want my business
jeopardized.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.350
Good day, gentlemen.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.990
- The body had to
be electroplated here.
It's the only factory in town.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.426
- Unless someone had
a private facility.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.428
- That seems unlikely.

05:29.430 --> 05:32.130
See what you can find out
about the victim.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.599
- Sir.

05:34.601 --> 05:37.135
- She was stabbed.
A single thrust to the heart.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.137
The wound was very clean,
suggesting

05:39.139 --> 05:41.606
the knife was pushed in and
withdrawn at the same angle.

05:41.608 --> 05:44.810
- Which led you to believe that
she was incapacitated when
she was killed?

05:44.812 --> 05:46.945
- Yes. I analyzed her
stomach contents.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.980
She had drunk and eaten
shortly before she died.

05:48.982 --> 05:52.718
I found significant amounts of
the sedative sulfonal.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.986
- He wanted her unconscious.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.489
- She died approximately
eighteen hours ago.

05:57.491 --> 06:00.225
The killer waited
until rigor had set in.

06:00.227 --> 06:03.328
- Then once rigor was fully in
evidence and the body was fixed

06:03.330 --> 06:06.164
in the pose, he set about the
task of electroplating.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.266
It's quite the operation.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.369
- She sat down to share
a meal with her killer.

06:10.371 --> 06:12.371
It might have been someone
she knew.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.373
- Someone she trusted.

06:14.375 --> 06:17.542
- Who is she, William?
- George is looking into

06:17.544 --> 06:20.312
the missing persons.
Someone has to have reported

06:20.314 --> 06:23.715
her disappearance.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.079
- Sir?

06:54.081 --> 06:56.715
Do you think there is a real
body inside this one?

06:56.717 --> 06:58.850
- Most likely, George.
- Strange

06:58.852 --> 07:00.852
and unsettling, isn't it, sir?

07:00.854 --> 07:03.088
- Indeed it is.

07:05.725 --> 07:08.126
Did the man who found it
move it in any way?

07:08.128 --> 07:10.128
- No sir, he was so shaken

07:10.130 --> 07:12.998
by the sight of the thing
he has sworn himself off drink.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.535
- And he has no idea
how it came to be here?

07:16.537 --> 07:18.870
- He says when he fell asleep he
had the bench to himself.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.373
It wasn't until first light when
he awoke and he realized...

07:21.375 --> 07:23.809
he had company.

07:23.811 --> 07:26.378
Sir --

07:26.380 --> 07:29.748
- Please move along, sir.
(camera shutter)

07:29.750 --> 07:33.285
- The murder of the second
victim was a match to the first.

07:33.287 --> 07:36.721
Sedated and killed by a single
stab wound to the heart.

07:36.723 --> 07:40.158
Quite possibly the same weapon.
- I see. Anything else?

07:40.160 --> 07:43.195
- I believe they may have been
murdered within minutes
of each other.

07:43.197 --> 07:46.264
- So both alive at the same time
and with the killer.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.500
- Yes. It seems they may
have eaten together.

07:48.502 --> 07:51.102
I found the same stomach
contents, including sulfonal.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.805
But they weren't electroplated
at the same time.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.941
Lividity suggests the second
woman was electroplated

07:55.943 --> 07:58.376
some twelve hours
after she died.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.512
- So one killer could have
worked alone.

08:00.514 --> 08:03.815
- It's quite possible.
Have you identified them yet?

08:03.817 --> 08:07.686
- No. None of the
missing persons match
either of their descriptions.

08:07.688 --> 08:11.690
- They were both young women,
aged by hard living.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.792
They could have been
prostitutes.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.794
- I see.

08:15.796 --> 08:19.631
I'll have the constables
canvass St. John's Ward.

08:26.906 --> 08:29.441
- Oy, you there.

08:29.443 --> 08:31.576
Have you seen either
of these women?

08:33.546 --> 08:35.547
- Have you seen either
of these women?

08:35.549 --> 08:39.017
- No.
- Are you sure?

08:39.019 --> 08:41.319
(indistinct discussion)

08:46.926 --> 08:49.094
- Take your time.

08:56.435 --> 08:59.037
- Bloody rozzers.
- Hey, you two--

08:59.039 --> 09:01.940
- Move it, Cora!
- George -- Come back here!

09:06.846 --> 09:08.847
- Keep your hands off us.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.849
- Men usually pay
good money for that.

09:10.851 --> 09:13.485
- Who are they?
- Sir,

09:13.487 --> 09:16.187
this couple of "ladies" tried
to evade us. We figured

09:16.189 --> 09:18.390
they might know something.
- I have to warn you, sir,

09:18.392 --> 09:21.226
they're not inclined
to cooperate.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.162
- Ladies, I'm Detective Murdoch,
and I'd like to ask you--

09:24.164 --> 09:26.164
- Save your breath.
We don't talk to coppers.

09:28.868 --> 09:31.236
- We are trying to identify
these two women.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.239
Can you help us?
- Who's asking?

09:34.241 --> 09:36.241
- Doctor Julia Ogden.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.410
And you are?
- Ginny.

09:38.412 --> 09:41.513
Just Ginny. And this is Cora.

09:41.515 --> 09:43.515
- These two women are lying
in the city morgue.

09:43.517 --> 09:48.119
They've been murdered.
- We keep to ourselves, missus.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.822
- Is that why you ran when the
constables approached you?

09:50.824 --> 09:53.024
- We don't get involved in what
don't concern us, do we, Ginny?

09:53.026 --> 09:55.360
- Well, perhaps you don't,

09:55.362 --> 09:58.496
but I won't allow these women to
go to their graves nameless.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.498
I think they deserve better.

10:00.500 --> 10:04.069
- We open our mouths;
the killer comes after us next.

10:04.071 --> 10:07.072
- Telling me what you know may
help us catch a murderer.

10:07.074 --> 10:10.208
Don't you want that?
- Sorry to interrupt,

10:10.210 --> 10:12.410
Doctor. You're needed.

10:12.412 --> 10:15.213
- Excuse me.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.882
- (George): It's the park behind
the Normal School this time.

10:21.654 --> 10:24.155
- A third victim, Julia.

10:24.157 --> 10:27.659
It would appear we have a
sequential killer on our hands.

10:27.661 --> 10:30.028
- Look how the body
has been posed.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.797
He's arranging each of his
victims in a different way.

10:32.799 --> 10:36.601
- He's sending us a message.
The question is: what?

10:53.052 --> 10:55.420
- I'm almost finished here,
William.

10:55.422 --> 10:58.490
- Sorry, ma'am.
I can come back later.

10:58.492 --> 11:01.059
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were

11:01.061 --> 11:03.862
my husband. We haven't met yet.

11:03.864 --> 11:06.097
Doctor Julia Ogden.
- Rebecca James.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.967
I clean at nights.
You the new coroner?

11:08.969 --> 11:11.870
- In a manner of speaking, yes.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.406
- Oh, no,

11:14.408 --> 11:16.541
not another one
of those statue murders!

11:16.543 --> 11:18.410
- You've been following
the news?

11:18.412 --> 11:20.412
- I'm no sensationalist, Doctor.

11:20.414 --> 11:24.315
But the notion of encasing
corpses -- that would preserve
every small detail.

11:24.317 --> 11:27.018
I would think it would make
your job a bit easier.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.255
- Indeed it does. That's very
well-observed, Miss James.

11:30.257 --> 11:33.425
I'll let you get back
to your work.

11:33.427 --> 11:35.493
- Thank you, Doctor.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.202
- As if we haven't got enough
to deal with,

11:44.204 --> 11:47.305
these naked statues are causing
havoc across the city.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.307
You've got whatever you need
to get it sorted,

11:49.309 --> 11:51.309
and that's orders from above.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.311
So nothing on who
these women are yet?

11:53.313 --> 11:56.314
- No sir, though it seems
possible that they were
all prostitutes.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.383
- So we've got a Ripper
type on our hands.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.019
- Sir, do you recall
a case a few years ago,

12:01.021 --> 12:03.688
in Hamilton, I believe--
- Yes,

12:03.690 --> 12:05.790
there was a fellow going around
killing doxies.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.093
They caught him, had plenty
of evidence to convict,

12:08.095 --> 12:12.263
but the bastard got off on
a technicality. Uh... Dray.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.999
Arthur, Albert, Alfred,
something like that.

12:15.001 --> 12:17.535
- Yes, sir. Perhaps Mr. Dray
is up to his old tricks.

12:17.537 --> 12:20.538
- No. It couldn't be him,
Murdoch. He was killed
shortly after he got out.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.540
- For you, William.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.642
Good morning, Inspector.
- Thank you.

12:24.644 --> 12:27.645
- Good morning, Doctor.
Late night, I gather.
- Indeed. The killing of

12:27.647 --> 12:30.682
the third victim follows the
pattern. Same stomach contents,

12:30.684 --> 12:33.818
same sedative. And the stab
wound with the same weapon.

12:33.820 --> 12:36.187
- So he drugged, then killed
them all together.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.656
These sequential killers
are bloody devils.

12:38.658 --> 12:41.726
- Sir, I don't
believe we're dealing
with a sequential killer.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.728
He gathered them all
in the same place

12:43.730 --> 12:45.730
and killed them
at the same time.

12:45.732 --> 12:47.966
There's no development or
progression to his actions.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.301
- Unless these are only the
first of his victims.

12:50.303 --> 12:53.304
- Well, that's a
cheering thought, Doctor.
- Though he doesn't follow

12:53.306 --> 12:55.740
a sequential pattern, turning
his victims into statues

12:55.742 --> 12:57.742
suggests a pathology
even more curious.

12:57.744 --> 13:00.845
- Sounds to me like
he's taunting us.

13:00.847 --> 13:03.681
Doesn't this kind of killer
often want to be caught?

13:03.683 --> 13:06.251
- But he leaves nothing
to point to himself.

13:06.253 --> 13:08.319
Instead, he shines a lantern

13:08.321 --> 13:11.389
on his victims
by displaying them publicly.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.892
- He wants the women
to be looked at.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.528
- But only after they're killed.
- Is he honouring them in some

13:16.530 --> 13:18.530
strange way?
Or humiliating them?

13:18.532 --> 13:20.932
- Well, that would certainly fit
with the nakedness.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.434
- Or is he just killing for the
fun of it and then boasting

13:23.436 --> 13:25.436
about it afterwards?
- Yes, William.

13:25.438 --> 13:28.506
Look at the pattern in the wax
coating? Is it some kind
of hieroglyph?

13:30.242 --> 13:33.244
- What is it?
- Sir, I believe we need to pay

13:33.246 --> 13:35.313
Mr. Kirkham another visit.

13:38.450 --> 13:41.252
- The same pattern.
- Mr. Kirkham,

13:41.254 --> 13:44.322
I'm going to need a list of all
your employees as well as anyone

13:44.324 --> 13:46.391
who may have had access
to this facility.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.526
- Well, that will take
some time to compile.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.596
- Then you'd better get started.

13:51.598 --> 13:54.098
Lack of cooperation

13:54.100 --> 13:56.367
and no expression of concern
for the dead women.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.404
He's our man, Murdoch.
- What would his motive be?

13:59.406 --> 14:01.339
- Killing for the sheer
pleasure,

14:01.341 --> 14:03.474
like the doctor said, or any
other bloody thing.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.110
I don't know. The women were put
in his copper bath and

14:06.112 --> 14:08.780
that puts him top of the list.
- Sirs,

14:08.782 --> 14:11.149
I just spoke to a workman
who saw one of

14:11.151 --> 14:14.152
our dead women enter the
building across the way
three nights ago.

14:14.154 --> 14:17.689
Apparently it's a place ladies
of the night take their escorts.

14:17.691 --> 14:20.091
- You look into that, Murdoch.
I'll ride roughshod

14:20.093 --> 14:22.160
over our friend Kirkham.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.635
- Looks like somebody took
a meal here, sir.

15:03.637 --> 15:05.637
- It certainly does.

15:05.639 --> 15:08.273
- Bread and wine.

15:11.844 --> 15:14.078
Grease from meat.

15:23.222 --> 15:25.223
- Blood, George.

15:25.225 --> 15:28.860
The women were killed here.

15:28.862 --> 15:31.029
He then prepared their bodies,

15:31.031 --> 15:34.265
transported them across the
street for electroplating,

15:34.267 --> 15:36.701
each one in turn.
- Sir, whoever did this

15:36.703 --> 15:39.804
put a great deal of thought
into it. There must be

15:39.806 --> 15:43.808
a very specific reason
to go to such lengths.

15:43.810 --> 15:46.678
- Indeed. And that reason

15:46.680 --> 15:49.814
will be the key to solving
these murders, George.

16:02.027 --> 16:05.096
- They said at the station house
I'd find you here.

16:05.098 --> 16:08.032
I should've spoken up earlier,
but I didn't know

16:08.034 --> 16:10.768
if I could trust you --
y'know, to find the killer.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.571
- Well you've come to the right
place. I'll do everything

16:13.573 --> 16:16.274
in my power to see that he is
caught. You have my word.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.676
- I saw what happened.

16:18.678 --> 16:22.680
I saw the statue in the
park. It was terrible.
- You were there?

16:22.682 --> 16:24.682
- I know who she is.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.718
I know who they all are.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.720
- Do you have their names?

16:28.722 --> 16:31.289
- Doreen Booth was the first.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.624
Then Fern Mason.

16:33.626 --> 16:37.261
Elsie Black was the last one.
We worked on the streets
together.

16:37.263 --> 16:41.632
(phone ringing)

16:41.634 --> 16:45.403
- Dr. Julia Ogden. It's alright!
- I should go. I shouldn't have
come here in the first place.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.538
- William, I'll be there
as soon as possible.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.375
No, please don't go, Ginny.
- No, let me go, missus.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.377
I've said enough.

17:01.220 --> 17:04.055
- Julia. Number four.

17:04.057 --> 17:06.057
Another park, another pose.

17:06.059 --> 17:09.427
- This one has no facial
features.

17:09.429 --> 17:12.497
What are you thinking?

17:12.499 --> 17:15.199
- There's something oddly
familiar

17:15.201 --> 17:17.235
about the way this one is posed.

17:17.237 --> 17:21.305
I can't quite...
It looks familiar.

17:21.307 --> 17:23.775
- The way her arms are
outstretched,

17:23.777 --> 17:26.611
like a gesture of giving?
- Yes.

17:26.613 --> 17:29.213
But how does it relate
to the others?

17:59.711 --> 18:02.547
(metallic whirring)

18:16.462 --> 18:18.529
(phone ringing)

18:21.967 --> 18:23.968
Detective Murdoch.

18:23.970 --> 18:26.204
- The fourth statue, William.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.239
No corpse.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.608
Just a mannequin
with no facial features.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.478
Clearly intentional on
the part of the killer.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.581
- What does it represent?
And how does it fit

18:36.583 --> 18:40.084
with the other murdered women?
- Perhaps the blank face

18:40.086 --> 18:44.489
suggests someone who is
absent or missing.
- Or next.

18:52.097 --> 18:56.767
- What if the mannequin is the
focus of this whole thing?

18:59.071 --> 19:00.838
- Maybe...

19:07.546 --> 19:09.614
(whoosh)

19:11.550 --> 19:13.618
(dramatic music)

19:43.482 --> 19:46.317
- The killer is recreating
<i>The Last Supper.</i>

19:55.494 --> 19:58.062
- Very clever,
but by my count there are 13

19:58.064 --> 20:00.464
at   <i>The Last Supper.</i>
<i>You're not suggesting</i>

20:00.466 --> 20:02.667
that we could be expecting
nine more corpses?

20:02.669 --> 20:07.104
- If the killer
intends to replicate the
entire painting, there may be.

20:07.106 --> 20:09.774
- So the mannequin
represents Jesus.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.876
- Yes. And the three
electroplated corpses

20:11.878 --> 20:15.346
represent Peter,
Judas and Thomas,

20:15.348 --> 20:17.648
all three apostles
who betrayed their Lord.

20:17.650 --> 20:21.152
- Could that be the killer's
message? He was betrayed.

20:21.154 --> 20:24.922
- Interestingly, Da Vinci placed
all three very close to Jesus.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.425
- So who's this?
- That would be John,

20:27.427 --> 20:30.027
the apostle Jesus favoured most.

20:30.029 --> 20:32.530
- You think the electroplater
was betrayed by the three women

20:32.532 --> 20:35.299
and killing them is his revenge?
- Or he killed them

20:35.301 --> 20:38.336
to send a message to whomever
actually betrayed him.

20:38.338 --> 20:41.973
- Y'mean some maniac is killing
women he didn't know just
to send a message?

20:41.975 --> 20:44.508
- It's possible.
They were prostitutes

20:44.510 --> 20:48.179
and expendable
in the eyes of most.
- Ginny and Cora may have seen

20:48.181 --> 20:51.215
something. Perhaps they'll
confide in you, Julia.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.991
- Thank you, missus.
- You're welcome.

20:59.993 --> 21:02.226
- So what do you want?

21:02.228 --> 21:04.228
- Your help.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.230
- Just leave us alone.

21:06.232 --> 21:11.068
- We have to trust her, Cora.
What other choice do we have?

21:11.070 --> 21:13.504
- Did you see Doreen, or Fern,
or Elsie with anyone

21:13.506 --> 21:15.973
in particular three nights ago?
- No.

21:15.975 --> 21:19.744
Anyone could've picked them up.
They worked for themselves,
like us.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.746
- So they weren't part
of a brothel?

21:21.748 --> 21:23.848
- Not anymore.
They moved to Toronto

21:23.850 --> 21:25.850
once their house
in Hamilton closed.

21:25.852 --> 21:28.452
- And when was that?
- Two years ago.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.488
After the owner, Sally Brown,
was hanged.

21:30.490 --> 21:34.525
- Hanged?
- She killed
that monster, Albert Dray.

21:34.527 --> 21:37.261
- She did the right thing, too.
- He murdered her girls

21:37.263 --> 21:40.531
and she loved her girls,
didn't she, Ginny?

21:40.533 --> 21:42.833
We were like family.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.835
- So you were part
of the same house?

21:44.837 --> 21:48.739
- Yeah, we were. And then
we all came to Toronto.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.975
There's not many of us left.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.977
- Sally protected us back then.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.246
Nobody's protecting us now.

21:55.248 --> 21:58.282
- So you have no idea
who could be doing this?

21:58.284 --> 22:01.352
- No.

22:04.056 --> 22:07.425
- The victims were
all prostitutes from
the same Hamilton household.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.427
- And the owner
of the brothel was hanged

22:09.429 --> 22:12.563
for killing Albert Dray.
- If the killer chose

22:12.565 --> 22:15.299
his victims from
the same house, why?

22:15.301 --> 22:17.368
- Someone mimicking Albert Dray?

22:17.370 --> 22:21.005
- How does a copycat fit with
message of The Last Supper?

22:21.007 --> 22:23.708
We need the files
from the Dray case.

22:28.613 --> 22:31.549
It seems clear that Sally Brown
murdered Albert Dray.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.584
The murder weapon was found
in her room

22:33.586 --> 22:35.586
and she offered no defense.

22:35.588 --> 22:38.222
- What does the Dray case got to
do with our friend Mr. Kirkham?

22:38.224 --> 22:41.459
- Sir?
- Well, the dead girls were
electroplated in his factory.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.961
We should be taking
that place apart.

22:43.963 --> 22:46.197
- Establishing motive may be the
most efficient approach

22:46.199 --> 22:48.766
to solving this case, sir.
- The method of murder

22:48.768 --> 22:51.102
suggests a very
disturbed psyche.

22:51.104 --> 22:53.270
- Right. You've one more day on
the psychological mumbo jumbo

22:53.272 --> 22:56.307
road, and then we're tearing
that factory apart. Got it?

22:56.309 --> 22:59.610
- "The mumbo jumbo road"?

22:59.612 --> 23:01.545
(chuckling)

23:01.547 --> 23:04.982
- If I didn't know the Inspector
better, I would say that that
was a challenge.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.318
- Well then, let's take it.

23:07.320 --> 23:10.654
- There's mention
of a priest here,

23:10.656 --> 23:12.790
Father Raymond.

23:12.792 --> 23:15.493
He was a character witness
in Sally Brown's trial.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.495
- Yes, I knew Sally Brown.

23:17.497 --> 23:20.664
I visited her many times after
she converted to Catholicism.

23:20.666 --> 23:23.134
- She became devout.

23:23.136 --> 23:26.003
- Yes, a true believer.

23:26.005 --> 23:28.339
I think it gave her
comfort to know

23:28.341 --> 23:31.375
she was joining her Lord and
Saviour in the afterlife.

23:31.377 --> 23:33.511
- Did she ever speak
of Albert Dray?

23:33.513 --> 23:35.880
- Only to say that
he deserved to die.

23:35.882 --> 23:39.083
She never denied she was
guilty of the crime,

23:39.085 --> 23:41.352
although I suspected

23:41.354 --> 23:43.354
there was a lot more to the
sordid business.

23:43.356 --> 23:45.456
- In what way?

23:45.458 --> 23:49.126
- I believe she went to the
gallows protecting someone.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.829
I begged her to talk to me
about it, but

23:51.831 --> 23:54.064
she refused all my efforts.

23:54.066 --> 23:57.468
- It's your belief that she
didn't kill Albert Dray?

23:57.470 --> 24:00.638
- I strongly suspect that she
did not, Detective.

24:00.640 --> 24:04.341
But since she refused to speak,
I could do nothing about it.

24:04.343 --> 24:06.610
But, mark my words,

24:06.612 --> 24:09.480
whoever did this cannot hide
from the eyes of God.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.849
They will be punished,

24:11.851 --> 24:14.251
in this world or the next.
- Harsh words

24:14.253 --> 24:17.188
from the mouth
of a priest, Father.

24:17.190 --> 24:20.291
- I think Our Lord will grant me
a less than charitable response

24:20.293 --> 24:22.626
to those that deserve it.

24:33.939 --> 24:36.140
- Doctor Ogden.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.742
- Oh, hello again, Miss James.

24:38.744 --> 24:41.378
- I'm very sorry.
I will change my hours

24:41.380 --> 24:43.447
to better fit your work. I don't
recall the previous coroner

24:43.449 --> 24:46.717
working quite so late.
- No, don't let me disturb you.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.786
I'm just here to collect
some papers.

24:59.698 --> 25:02.166
I see Shelley is particularly
dusty this evening.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.235
- I'm sorry?

25:04.237 --> 25:07.071
- The previous coroner
named him Shelley.

25:07.073 --> 25:10.074
- I see.

25:10.076 --> 25:12.543
I couldn't help noticing

25:12.545 --> 25:15.145
that this bone
is at an odd angle.

25:15.147 --> 25:17.515
- Yes, it seems
the poor fellow had a fracture

25:17.517 --> 25:21.652
that didn't heal properly.
- So the clavicle doesn't
lay horizontally.

25:21.654 --> 25:24.688
- You know anatomy.
- A little.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.757
Bones are endlessly intriguing.

25:26.759 --> 25:29.793
But I should let you go.
- Yes.

25:29.795 --> 25:32.463
My husband will be waiting.

25:32.465 --> 25:34.632
- Then I wish you good night.

25:34.634 --> 25:36.634
- Thank you. Although
I have a feeling

25:36.636 --> 25:39.036
my day's work is far from over.

25:43.108 --> 25:45.743
- Albert Dray was killed
on March 29th,

25:45.745 --> 25:48.846
1901. His body was found
near an ice house

25:48.848 --> 25:50.848
on Hamilton Harbour.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.850
- According to the Hamilton
coroner, Mr. Dray died

25:52.852 --> 25:56.253
from multiple stab wounds.
And listen to this, William.

25:56.255 --> 25:58.656
They found laudanum
in his stomach.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.591
- He was also sedated.

26:00.593 --> 26:03.694
Like our victims.
- Sedated and stabbed.
Coincidence?

26:03.696 --> 26:06.196
- I think not. What else?

26:06.198 --> 26:09.166
- He sustained five stab wounds.

26:09.168 --> 26:12.836
Look at this photo.
According to the report,

26:12.838 --> 26:16.607
this is the fatal wound.
The knife entered at
an oblique angle.

26:16.609 --> 26:19.843
- So it would be impossible to
determine with absolute accuracy

26:19.845 --> 26:22.479
the dimensions of the weapon?

26:22.481 --> 26:25.616
I ask because

26:25.618 --> 26:29.987
this is the knife that was found
in Sally Brown's room.

26:29.989 --> 26:33.057
- It could be the murder weapon.

26:33.059 --> 26:35.993
- And what of these wounds?

26:35.995 --> 26:38.562
- I'll need to study them.

26:38.564 --> 26:41.298
- Right. I'll order some supper.

26:48.573 --> 26:50.941
Thank you.

26:50.943 --> 26:54.979
- William. Look at these two
cuts to the upper abdomen.

26:54.981 --> 26:57.181
Based on the different
points of entry,

26:57.183 --> 27:00.117
one was a right-handed blow,
the other left-handed.

27:00.119 --> 27:03.587
- Two killers.

27:03.589 --> 27:06.490
- These wounds on his torso are
so distinct I believe

27:06.492 --> 27:08.926
they were inflicted by five
different weapons.

27:08.928 --> 27:10.928
- Multiple killers.

27:10.930 --> 27:13.430
- The Hamilton police should
have seen this.

27:13.432 --> 27:17.334
- Yes, well, this does suggest
a less than thorough
investigation.

27:17.336 --> 27:20.170
Once the knife was found in
Sally Brown's room,

27:20.172 --> 27:23.340
the detective on the case
focused on all of his attention

27:23.342 --> 27:26.443
on her. She was arrested
and charged within hours.

27:26.445 --> 27:29.546
- Did she speak in her
own defense?
- Oh, yes.

27:29.548 --> 27:32.883
"The monster is in hell
where he belongs.

27:32.885 --> 27:35.686
For that I am well pleased."

27:35.688 --> 27:38.822
- So Sally Brown signed her own
death warrant.

27:43.762 --> 27:46.030
- Right. Let's go over this
again, Julia.

27:46.032 --> 27:50.300
Five stab wounds inflicted by
five different weapons.

27:50.302 --> 27:52.436
So likely five
different killers.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.471
- The properties of the wounds
suggest they were inflicted

27:54.473 --> 27:58.275
at the same time.
- Five killers were
working together.

27:58.277 --> 28:01.378
- Mr. Dray's victims all came
from the same brothel.

28:01.380 --> 28:04.248
- And when Mr. Dray was released
without being charged...

28:04.250 --> 28:08.585
- Sally Brown and four others
sought justice and killed him,

28:08.587 --> 28:10.754
a group acting as one.
- (sighing): But what about

28:10.756 --> 28:13.824
the copper statues
and <i>The Last Supper?</i>

28:13.826 --> 28:18.028
We're missing something here.
- (sighing): Yes,

28:18.030 --> 28:20.964
but it's late, William.

28:20.966 --> 28:23.467
I have to go to bed.

28:23.469 --> 28:25.969
I'm exhausted. You coming?

28:25.971 --> 28:27.905
- I'll be along shortly.

28:49.627 --> 28:52.963
(whispering): Julia. Julia.

28:52.965 --> 28:55.265
Julia. Wake up!
- William.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.534
What time is it?

28:57.536 --> 29:00.704
- It's... I don't know,
I don't know.

29:00.706 --> 29:03.607
Listen to me, Julia.

29:03.609 --> 29:06.510
Judas betrayed Jesus for thirty
pieces of silver

29:06.512 --> 29:08.545
and in doing so,
sent him to his death.

29:08.547 --> 29:10.681
- What are you talking about?
- It all fits.

29:10.683 --> 29:13.817
Peter denied knowing His Lord.

29:13.819 --> 29:16.653
Thomas doubted the resurrection.
- William, slow down.

29:16.655 --> 29:19.790
I'm completely lost.
- A constable interviewed

29:19.792 --> 29:22.226
three women at the Hamilton
brothel the night

29:22.228 --> 29:25.863
that Albert Dray was murdered.
They were Doreen Booth,

29:25.865 --> 29:28.799
Fern Mason and Elsie Black.

29:28.801 --> 29:31.101
- Our three victims.
- Yes. The constable spoke

29:31.103 --> 29:34.238
with Doreen first.
According to his notes,

29:34.240 --> 29:37.708
she told him that Sally
was with Albert Dray

29:37.710 --> 29:40.744
at the time of the murder.
- Doreen was the first
statue. Judas, right?

29:40.746 --> 29:44.715
- Judas the Betrayer.
And that's not all. Fern--

29:44.717 --> 29:48.285
- The Peter statue.
- Yes. Apparently,

29:48.287 --> 29:52.856
Sally told the constable that
she was with Fern that night.

29:52.858 --> 29:55.826
But Fern--
- Let me guess: denied that.

29:55.828 --> 29:59.263
- Exactly. She was asked
a number of times

29:59.265 --> 30:02.332
and in each instance she said
that she was not

30:02.334 --> 30:05.035
with Sally that night.
- And what about Elsie?

30:05.037 --> 30:08.005
- Elsie was asked to corroborate
the events of that evening.

30:08.007 --> 30:10.107
But she said she doubted
her memory

30:10.109 --> 30:13.110
because she had drank too much.
She couldn't be sure
of anything.

30:13.112 --> 30:15.546
- Elsie was the third statue --
Doubting Thomas.

30:15.548 --> 30:19.116
- So with everything pointing in
one direction, Sally is charged

30:19.118 --> 30:22.219
with the murder.
- Despite compelling forensic

30:22.221 --> 30:24.421
evidence suggesting
multiple killers.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.957
- And Sally goes to her grave
without breathing a word.

30:26.959 --> 30:29.126
- William. What if

30:29.128 --> 30:32.796
Sally, Doreen, Fern, and Elsie
made a pact to kill Dray?

30:32.798 --> 30:35.599
They agreed to stick to the same
story if they were questioned.

30:35.601 --> 30:38.035
Then under pressure
three of them crumbled

30:38.037 --> 30:40.470
and the blame went to Sally.

30:40.472 --> 30:43.006
Someone is exacting revenge
on those who got away

30:43.008 --> 30:46.743
with Mr. Dray's murder.
- Julia, there are five killers.

30:46.745 --> 30:49.813
Counting Sally Brown,
four of them are dead.

30:49.815 --> 30:52.416
- That means one of them
is still out there.

30:52.418 --> 30:55.719
- If we are right, there is
still one more statue

30:55.721 --> 30:57.788
the killer must cast.

31:03.795 --> 31:06.797
<i>Sir, we have</i>
<i>ascertained the motive</i>
<i>for the electroplate murders.</i>

31:06.799 --> 31:10.100
It dates back
to the Albert Dray murder.

31:10.102 --> 31:12.436
- Five people killed him but
only one was hanged.

31:12.438 --> 31:14.438
- Sally Brown.
- Yes, sir.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.440
What if someone
is seeking revenge

31:16.442 --> 31:18.442
because only Sally was punished?

31:18.444 --> 31:21.345
He's killed three already.
- And the remaining murderer

31:21.347 --> 31:23.747
is likely the next victim.
- Which would explain

31:23.749 --> 31:27.918
the <i>Last Supper</i> tableau.
Sally being the central figure,

31:27.920 --> 31:31.288
the faceless mannequin.
And the others, her apostles,

31:31.290 --> 31:33.724
were the accomplices.
- That may be

31:33.726 --> 31:35.993
and it's a very nice story.
- Story?

31:35.995 --> 31:38.829
- Consider this, Doctor.
Albert Dray was nothing more

31:38.831 --> 31:41.498
than a low life thug.
Sally Brown was a prostitute.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.201
You're saying that someone
in their circle

31:44.203 --> 31:47.204
is an aficionado of
Leonardo Da Vinci?
- It's possible.

31:47.206 --> 31:50.540
- And when that someone is not
busy appreciating the world

31:50.542 --> 31:53.443
of fine art, he's learning how
to electroplate a human body?

31:53.445 --> 31:55.445
(chuckle)

31:55.447 --> 31:59.716
You two are ignoring the
obvious. The killer
is James Kirkham,

31:59.718 --> 32:01.652
the man who owns
the bloody factory where

32:01.654 --> 32:03.921
the bodies were turned
into statues.

32:03.923 --> 32:07.190
He must have known Albert Dray
and is avenging his murder.

32:07.192 --> 32:09.693
(distant throat clearing)

32:09.695 --> 32:12.162
- Excuse me for a moment.

32:12.164 --> 32:15.866
(Thomas laughing)
- He hates it when I'm right.

32:15.868 --> 32:18.802
- We'll see.

32:21.406 --> 32:23.407
- Detective Murdoch,
I know you're busy

32:23.409 --> 32:27.077
but I thought of something else,
a small detail.

32:27.079 --> 32:30.747
I'm not sure it has anything to
do with your investigation,

32:30.749 --> 32:35.018
but nevertheless...
- Please. Go on, Father.

32:35.020 --> 32:37.955
- When I went to hear Sally
Brown's final confession,

32:37.957 --> 32:40.791
she asked me to give her <i>Bible</i>
<i>to a friend of hers.</i>

32:40.793 --> 32:43.794
- Who was this?
- One of her girls, I believe.

32:43.796 --> 32:46.229
Ginny Beasley.
- Oh. Ginny.

32:46.231 --> 32:48.732
- You know her?
- We've spoken with her.

32:48.734 --> 32:51.535
- Well, Sally asked me to write
an inscription in the <i>Bible.</i>

32:51.537 --> 32:53.937
I remember it quite clearly --

32:53.939 --> 32:57.240
"To my faithful friend.
In my hour of darkness

32:57.242 --> 33:00.077
you were always at my side."
- Have you ever met Ginny?

33:00.079 --> 33:03.780
- Once, at the prison.

33:03.782 --> 33:05.916
- Ginny was Sally's
only visitor.

33:05.918 --> 33:08.385
- Sally refused to talk to
anyone but she may have confided

33:08.387 --> 33:10.787
in Ginny. She might be
our last victim.

33:10.789 --> 33:13.090
- If she isn't already.
George, Henry.

33:13.092 --> 33:16.293
We need to find Ginny
straight away.
- Sir.

33:20.765 --> 33:24.301
- Higgins. There.

33:24.303 --> 33:26.370
Miss! Wait!

33:26.372 --> 33:28.839
Stop!
(horse neighing)

33:41.419 --> 33:43.620
(heavy breathing)

33:43.622 --> 33:45.622
- What do you want now?

33:45.624 --> 33:48.759
- You need to come down
to the station, miss.

33:48.761 --> 33:51.928
And where's your friend Cora?
- I don't know.

33:51.930 --> 33:54.031
- Have a look for her, Higgins.

33:54.033 --> 33:57.067
You come with me.

34:01.839 --> 34:03.840
- (Ginny): <i>Why am I here?</i>

34:03.842 --> 34:06.243
- What do you know about the
plan to kill Albert Dray?

34:06.245 --> 34:08.578
- I don't know anything.

34:08.580 --> 34:11.048
- You were close to Sally Brown.
She must have said something.

34:13.351 --> 34:17.187
We now believe Doreen, Fern, and
Elsie murdered Albert Dray

34:17.189 --> 34:20.323
along with Sally. And that's
why they were killed.

34:20.325 --> 34:23.994
- Who else was involved?
Were you one of them?

34:23.996 --> 34:27.531
We need your help to catch
whoever's bent on revenge.

34:27.533 --> 34:30.000
- Albert Dray was a vile
creature.

34:30.002 --> 34:32.536
What he did to our friends...
- Were you the fifth murderer?

34:32.538 --> 34:35.739
- No.
- But you knew of
the plan to murder him.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.475
- Only what Sally told me after.

34:38.477 --> 34:42.379
She was the one who lured him
into the house and drugged him.

34:42.381 --> 34:45.215
Then they all took him to the
harbour and stabbed him.

34:45.217 --> 34:47.184
- What happened after that?

34:47.186 --> 34:49.286
- Well, they were supposed to
say they were nowhere near Dray,

34:49.288 --> 34:52.823
but that copper,
he got hold of Doreen.

34:52.825 --> 34:55.192
Said if she didn't tell him what
she knew, he was going to

34:55.194 --> 34:58.628
throw her in prison.
He would have done it, too.

34:58.630 --> 35:02.199
I saw him with her.
She was crying.

35:02.201 --> 35:04.901
That's when I guessed what
they'd all done.

35:04.903 --> 35:07.604
- So Doreen gave up Sally.
- Yeah.

35:07.606 --> 35:10.173
She said Sally was with Dray
that night.

35:10.175 --> 35:13.543
Then the others caved in when he
started bullying them.

35:13.545 --> 35:16.546
They searched Sally's room,
found the knife...

35:16.548 --> 35:18.748
- She was hanged while the
others went free.

35:18.750 --> 35:22.352
- And now someone
is murdering them. Who?

35:22.354 --> 35:26.022
- I don't know.
- Have you ever heard
the name James Kirkham?

35:26.024 --> 35:28.892
- Kirkham? Yeah, there was
a Mr. Kirkham that used to

35:28.894 --> 35:31.194
come around the house.

35:31.196 --> 35:33.196
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:33.198 --> 35:35.198
He was one of Sally's.

35:35.200 --> 35:37.400
He came regular to see her.

35:37.402 --> 35:39.836
- Anything else?

35:39.838 --> 35:42.072
- Well, he was very upset when
she was arrested.

35:42.074 --> 35:44.574
Said the law had it all wrong,

35:44.576 --> 35:47.344
that killing Dray
was doing the world a favour.

35:47.346 --> 35:50.113
- Let's go, Murdoch.

35:52.049 --> 35:55.385
- Until the
murderer is apprehended,
this is the safest place.

35:55.387 --> 35:57.521
Dr. Ogden will stay with you.

36:02.593 --> 36:05.929
It would appear your initial
instincts were correct.

36:05.931 --> 36:09.833
Kirkham is our killer.
- Basic police logic.

36:09.835 --> 36:12.469
- One thing puzzles, sir.

36:12.471 --> 36:16.173
If Kirkham said that killing
Dray was doing the world

36:16.175 --> 36:19.643
a favour, then why murder the
women who killed him?

36:19.645 --> 36:22.279
- You've been spending too much
time with Dr. Ogden.

36:22.281 --> 36:24.915
Anyway.

36:24.917 --> 36:26.917
What more do you need?

36:26.919 --> 36:29.319
The fellow is mad.
Mad as a March hare.

36:32.156 --> 36:34.958
- Sally never said a word about
the others.

36:34.960 --> 36:38.528
She was a good woman.
- You were close?

36:38.530 --> 36:41.398
- She took me in when I was
alone on the streets.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.466
She didn't have to do that.

36:43.468 --> 36:45.669
- You felt safe under her roof?

36:45.671 --> 36:48.505
- I did.

36:48.507 --> 36:51.608
I didn't set out
for this life, missus,

36:51.610 --> 36:55.111
but once it happened,
there was no turning back.

36:55.113 --> 36:58.048
I was what I was,

36:58.050 --> 37:00.483
still a doxy entertaining men
every night,

37:00.485 --> 37:03.320
but she looked after me.

37:03.322 --> 37:06.456
No one ever did that
for me before.

37:06.458 --> 37:10.026
- She counted you as a friend
right 'til the end.

37:10.028 --> 37:13.163
- Well, I wasn't.
- She thought you were.

37:13.165 --> 37:15.932
That's why she wanted you to
have her <i>Bible.</i>

37:15.934 --> 37:17.934
You can take comfort
in that, Ginny.

37:17.936 --> 37:21.905
- Well, how can I? I did nothing
to help her.

37:26.310 --> 37:29.779
- Why am I here, may I ask?
- We can prove that the bodies

37:29.781 --> 37:33.016
were electroplated
at your factory.
- That may be

37:33.018 --> 37:36.019
but I didn't do it.
- Were you a friend
of Albert Dray?

37:36.021 --> 37:39.022
- Certainly not.
I never met the man.
- We now know that you were one

37:39.024 --> 37:41.925
of Miss Brown's regulars
at her Hamilton brothel.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.194
- That's absurd.

37:44.196 --> 37:46.196
Do I look like the kind of man
who visits prostitutes?

37:46.198 --> 37:48.365
- Listen,

37:48.367 --> 37:51.801
I know the kind of thrall that
a woman of her talents

37:51.803 --> 37:54.804
can have on a man. You were
upset when you lost her.

37:54.806 --> 37:57.507
You knew that she didn't kill
Dray on her own,

37:57.509 --> 37:59.976
so you decided to punish
the other women yourself --

37:59.978 --> 38:03.947
electroplating them into naked
statues to humiliate them.

38:03.949 --> 38:06.016
- I don't know what you are
talking about.

38:06.018 --> 38:09.753
I never went near Hamilton.
- Mr. Kirkham,

38:09.755 --> 38:13.556
I have my constables checking
hansom cabs for regular fares

38:13.558 --> 38:15.625
between the Hamilton
railway station

38:15.627 --> 38:18.161
and Miss Brown's former address.

38:18.163 --> 38:20.630
Now, are you telling me

38:20.632 --> 38:22.932
that you won't be recognized
as a frequent visitor?

38:22.934 --> 38:26.903
- Of course I won't.
- In my experience,

38:26.905 --> 38:29.539
cab drivers have got
very good memories, sir.

38:29.541 --> 38:32.742
- I might have gone to Hamilton
on business.

38:32.744 --> 38:36.546
- By way of a brothel?
(sigh)

38:36.548 --> 38:38.548
- Alright, alright,

38:38.550 --> 38:42.085
I'll admit I was
at Miss Brown's establishment

38:42.087 --> 38:44.387
on more than one occasion.

38:44.389 --> 38:47.123
I was assured discretion
was utmost at her house.

38:47.125 --> 38:50.460
- Right. You're under arrest.
- That's absurd.

38:50.462 --> 38:52.896
I don't know Albert Dray from
a hole in the wall.

38:52.898 --> 38:56.066
Why should I go after the women
who killed him?

38:56.068 --> 38:58.435
- You wouldn't. But you would

38:58.437 --> 39:01.237
go after the women
who betrayed Sally Brown.

39:01.239 --> 39:03.239
Who let her hang
for their crimes.

39:03.241 --> 39:05.275
- Why should I give

39:05.277 --> 39:08.445
a damn about Sally Brown?
- She was the woman you
were seeing.

39:08.447 --> 39:11.414
- I was not.
- You were at the brothel.

39:11.416 --> 39:13.883
- I was, but not
to see Sally Brown.

39:13.885 --> 39:16.486
I was the customer of

39:16.488 --> 39:19.823
a younger lady.
- Who?

39:19.825 --> 39:22.192
- Pretty English girl.

39:22.194 --> 39:25.161
Ginny is her name.
- Ginny Beasley?

39:25.163 --> 39:28.331
- We weren't on
last name terms, Detective.

39:28.333 --> 39:30.500
- Mr. Kirkham,

39:30.502 --> 39:33.002
does Ginny know that you have an
electroplating factory?

39:33.004 --> 39:35.472
- Yes, she does.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.540
After the Hamilton house closed,

39:37.542 --> 39:40.276
we would rendezvous at my office

39:40.278 --> 39:44.114
after business hours.
- So she would know her
way around the facility?

39:44.116 --> 39:46.716
- She took quite an interest in
the place, actually --

39:46.718 --> 39:48.685
how it all works,
that sort of thing.

39:48.687 --> 39:51.187
Quite unusual for a girl of--
- Excuse me.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.469
Where is she?
- She asked for a cup of tea.

40:06.471 --> 40:08.471
I went to fix it.

40:08.473 --> 40:11.207
- Julia. Ginny is the murderer.

40:11.209 --> 40:15.979
- Ginny? Why?
- The three women weren't
murdered to avenge Albert Dray.

40:15.981 --> 40:18.548
Ginny murdered them
to avenge Sally Brown.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.917
- She was in front
of us the whole time?

40:20.919 --> 40:23.787
- Doreen, Fern, and Elsie
betrayed Sally Brown.

40:23.789 --> 40:26.389
That's the meaning
of <i>The Last Supper.</i>

40:26.391 --> 40:28.625
Sally is Jesus.

40:28.627 --> 40:30.927
- She wanted us to figure
this out.

40:30.929 --> 40:35.031
Remember the inscription in the
<i>Bible</i> that Sally gave to her?
"To my faithful friend..."

40:35.033 --> 40:37.700
- John was the faithful
friend to Jesus.

40:37.702 --> 40:41.538
That's it. Ginny must see
herself as John,

40:41.540 --> 40:43.740
avenging Sally

40:43.742 --> 40:46.242
by punishing all of those
who betrayed her.

40:46.244 --> 40:49.446
- But who is the final victim?

40:49.448 --> 40:52.482
She intends to complete
the tableau.

40:59.723 --> 41:02.225
Ginny!

41:02.227 --> 41:04.294
Ginny?!

41:12.336 --> 41:15.505
- Oh, Ginny.

41:19.076 --> 41:21.077
Sally's <i>Bible.</i>

41:21.079 --> 41:23.480
- The inscription's
been crossed out.

41:23.482 --> 41:26.616
- Sally was offering forgiveness

41:26.618 --> 41:29.986
but Ginny couldn't
bring herself to accept it.

41:41.765 --> 41:44.067
- Ginny never saw
herself as blameless.

41:44.069 --> 41:46.603
But in her view of justice,
they should have gotten away

41:46.605 --> 41:48.738
with killing Albert Dray.

41:48.740 --> 41:51.274
- And they would have,
had they all had stuck together.

41:51.276 --> 41:53.276
- Yes, they would.

41:53.278 --> 41:56.746
But after Sally was hanged,
Ginny's guilt

41:56.748 --> 42:00.783
turned into hatred and then
everyone had to be punished.

42:00.785 --> 42:04.554
- Ginny always intended
to kill herself as well.

42:04.556 --> 42:08.858
- I believe so, but she had to
get her message out first.

42:10.928 --> 42:13.062
- Dray escaping justice
set into motion

42:13.064 --> 42:15.064
a tragic sequence of events.

42:15.066 --> 42:17.667
- Yes. Although...

42:17.669 --> 42:20.436
I think the tragedy began

42:20.438 --> 42:24.340
with whatever warped Dray's
psyche in the first place,

42:24.342 --> 42:26.342
compelling him to murder.

42:26.344 --> 42:28.344
- Ever the psychiatrist,

42:28.346 --> 42:31.047
even as you are again
our coroner.

42:33.517 --> 42:36.819
You must be tired.
- I'm thoroughly exhausted.

42:36.821 --> 42:39.322
- Well, then, I propose
a light supper,

42:39.324 --> 42:42.659
an early night and no files.

42:42.661 --> 42:46.062
- No files? How refreshing.

42:46.064 --> 42:48.965
Although I have to say

42:48.967 --> 42:51.834
nothing is more exciting than
working with you again.

42:51.836 --> 42:55.271
Well, maybe one thing.

42:55.273 --> 42:59.776
(giggling)

42:59.778 --> 43:02.545
- Shall we, then?

43:08.886 --> 43:11.087
- (Julia): <i>Dear Miss James, may</i>
<i>I suggest you look</i>

43:11.089 --> 43:13.289
<i>at Chapter Two on Osteology.</i>

43:13.291 --> 43:15.391
<i>I think you may find it</i>
<i>enlightening.</i>

43:15.393 --> 43:17.460
<i>Sincerely, Julia Ogden.</i>

43:32.142 --> 43:35.111
