09:07.108 --> 09:09.278
We're about to meet
with a guy named Booda,

09:09.278 --> 09:11.447
who's Cliven Bundy's
chief of security.

09:11.447 --> 09:13.992
He's gonna show us
around the property,

09:13.992 --> 09:15.619
and then take us
to meet the man himself.

09:15.619 --> 09:18.872
-Hey, how you doing?
-Hey, what's up, guys?

09:18.872 --> 09:20.291
-How you guys doing today?
-Abdullah.

09:20.291 --> 09:21.460
I'm Booda.
Pleasure to meet you.

09:21.460 --> 09:22.336
Nice to meet you.

09:22.336 --> 09:23.337
-Hey, Will.
-Booda.

09:23.337 --> 09:24.670
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

-Hi, Martina.
-Hi, I'm Booda.

09:25.881 --> 09:26.840
Pleasure to meet you guys.

09:26.840 --> 09:28.009
Welcome to the Bundy ranch.

09:28.009 --> 09:29.218
How you lived in Nevada?

09:29.218 --> 09:30.845
Uh, I came to Nevada
about a week

09:30.845 --> 09:32.930
before the standoff occurred.

09:32.930 --> 09:34.850
I'm not anti-government.
Let's get that clear real quick.

09:34.850 --> 09:37.479
I'm not anti-government.
I'm for limited government, uh,

09:37.479 --> 09:40.148
letting states take care
of themselves now.

09:40.148 --> 09:42.025
State sovereignty.

09:42.025 --> 09:43.944
I'm sure, like, a lot of people
came down during that standoff,

09:43.944 --> 09:46.822
but you were, I mean,
one of probably only a few

09:46.822 --> 09:49.242
who, like, became part
of the family, right?

09:49.242 --> 09:51.537
Uh, yeah.
When I first came out here,

09:51.537 --> 09:53.624
I, uh, introduced myself
to Mr. and Mrs. Bundy,

09:53.624 --> 09:56.793
and said, "You need security,

09:56.793 --> 09:58.671
and I'm here to help you
with that and only that."

09:58.671 --> 10:00.673
So I was in charge

10:00.673 --> 10:02.092
of the internal ranch
security property,

10:02.092 --> 10:04.010
and, uh, I've been
since day one.

10:04.010 --> 10:06.138
So you just, like,
you saw it on the news

10:06.138 --> 10:07.807
and it struck a chord
with you and you were like...

10:07.807 --> 10:09.351
Well, what got me was, uh,
an associate of mine

10:09.351 --> 10:10.893
called me up at work one day
and said,

10:10.893 --> 10:12.270
"Booda, have you seen
what's going on

10:12.270 --> 10:13.397
with this rancher
down in Nevada?"

10:13.397 --> 10:15.149
And I'm like, "No, I really
don't have time to take a look."

10:15.149 --> 10:17.360
I was busy that day. I said,

10:17.360 --> 10:18.695
"I'll check it out
on a lunch break."

10:18.695 --> 10:20.447
Sure enough, on my lunch break,
I checked on it and saw

10:20.447 --> 10:22.199
what was going on with the dogs
being sicked on them.

10:22.199 --> 10:26.162
The family being tasered
and everything else.

10:26.162 --> 10:28.624
It was just ridiculous.

10:28.624 --> 10:29.916
And at that point in time,
I said,

10:29.916 --> 10:31.794
"These people need some help,"
and I packed up and headed out.

10:31.794 --> 10:34.839
Protecting innocent life
is what's important for me,

10:34.839 --> 10:38.051
and I'm willing to be the buffer
and catch a bullet if I have to.

10:38.051 --> 10:40.346
You know, I might be
on a limb here,

10:40.346 --> 10:41.764
but, religiously speaking,
I think maybe

10:41.764 --> 10:43.350
I was brought out here
to be a protector of life.

10:44.101 --> 10:45.436
Where we at?

10:48.231 --> 10:49.566
This is where
the rallying point was

10:49.566 --> 10:51.485
for all the patriots
that came down here.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.237
People were fed here,

10:53.237 --> 10:54.780
given directions on
how they could help,

10:54.780 --> 10:56.700
and on the hill
right up behind you

10:56.700 --> 10:58.201
was where all the cowboys
were lined up,

10:58.201 --> 11:00.203
probably 50-75 cowboys

11:00.203 --> 11:02.038
were up there
on mounted horseback,

11:02.038 --> 11:03.458
and Cliven Bundy's youngest son,
Arden Bundy,

11:03.458 --> 11:05.918
took it upon himself
to charge up

11:05.918 --> 11:07.920
that hill on his horse and plant
that American flag up there,

11:07.920 --> 11:10.924
and that's when the crowd
erupted into cheer,

11:10.924 --> 11:13.595
and a great feeling of pride
came over everybody,

11:13.595 --> 11:16.097
seeing our flag
planted up there.

11:16.097 --> 11:18.934
God gave us a right to defend
and protect ourselves.

11:18.934 --> 11:21.563
The government met
a force of people

11:21.563 --> 11:23.648
that were willing to shed blood
for this country

11:23.648 --> 11:26.277
and what we're
trying to gain back.

11:26.277 --> 11:28.655
And when you have
firearms at your side,

11:28.655 --> 11:31.158
which is our
second-amendment right,

11:31.158 --> 11:32.493
that takes you to step back.

11:32.493 --> 11:33.994
"Well, maybe we picked
on the wrong people."

11:33.994 --> 11:35.954
What do you think the legacy
is gonna be

11:35.954 --> 11:37.540
of the standoff
that happened here?

11:37.540 --> 11:39.250
The legacy I want to leave
behind here for my children

11:39.250 --> 11:41.253
is that this is a spot where Dad

11:41.253 --> 11:42.671
and his friends
stood up and said,

11:42.671 --> 11:44.131
"We're tired of what you guys
are doing to us,

11:44.131 --> 11:46.218
and we're getting sick of it."

11:46.218 --> 11:49.639
Actually, the person you really
want to talk to about this,

11:49.639 --> 11:51.682
it'll be Mr. Bundy.

11:51.682 --> 11:54.520
What do you guys think
about Cliven Bundy?

11:54.520 --> 11:56.480
He's a racist who once said
that black people were better

11:56.480 --> 12:00.318
as slaves than they are today
as regular people.

12:00.318 --> 12:03.863
Um, he was aligned with
a bunch of some of America's

12:03.863 --> 12:08.787

militia-type folks.

12:08.787 --> 12:13.124
You know, he's a super,

12:13.124 --> 12:14.418

libertarian nut job.

12:14.418 --> 12:17.964
If I had a standoff with

-Yeah.

12:23.179 --> 12:24.848
-Yeah.

This is the flag
that we waved along

13:19.372 --> 13:20.749
with the American flag
as we stood.

13:20.749 --> 13:23.919
When you were sort of confronted
by the federal government,

13:23.919 --> 13:26.756
what exactly happened?

13:26.756 --> 13:28.675
You know, we've had cattle here
for about 140 years or so,

13:28.675 --> 13:32.429
and in like 1993-'94,

13:32.429 --> 13:36.935
the government started to say,
"We own this land."

13:36.935 --> 13:40.314
And then I finally
get to the point,

13:40.314 --> 13:41.900
I say, "Hell no.
I'm not gonna allow you

13:41.900 --> 13:44.694
to manage me
out of my business."

13:44.694 --> 13:46.321
So I quit paying
the grazing fees.

13:46.321 --> 13:49.116
And the government comes
and gets a lawsuit against me,

13:49.116 --> 13:53.455
saying, "You're trespassing
on our land."

13:53.455 --> 13:56.541
And so what am I gonna do?

Is my heritage done?

14:01.799 --> 14:03.132
Is this ranch totally done?

14:03.132 --> 14:05.094
And so they were basically

14:05.094 --> 14:06.638
just surrounding you
in some sense?

14:06.638 --> 14:09.099
Like, how many people
did they send out

14:09.099 --> 14:10.392
and how did you first detect

14:10.392 --> 14:11.811
that the federal government
had agents here?

14:11.811 --> 14:13.729
I estimate that there
was over 200 of them

14:13.729 --> 14:17.149
with military-type
armor and weapons.

14:17.149 --> 14:20.445

14:20.445 --> 14:21.948
they were several hundred

14:21.948 --> 14:24.492
They came from all parts
of the United States

14:24.492 --> 14:27.287
and they never was aggressive,
they were just there.

14:27.287 --> 14:31.459
But the militia did
have a threat, like,
'cause they had arms?

14:31.459 --> 14:34.880
Uh, you know,
there were some protection,

14:34.880 --> 14:36.424

a lot of credit.

that you would alter

15:44.048 --> 15:47.426
I guess, because
of my ignorance,

15:47.426 --> 15:49.763
I say the word Negro.

15:49.763 --> 15:51.765
Negro, to me,
didn't mean nothing bad.

15:51.765 --> 15:54.267
Well, I think
that one of the things

15:54.267 --> 15:55.603
that was almost
more offensive about it

15:55.603 --> 15:57.522
wasn't necessarily the use
of the term Negro,

15:57.522 --> 16:00.108
but it was the way
that the idea was structured.

16:00.108 --> 16:03.112
I think you said something
to the effect of,

16:03.112 --> 16:04.823
you know, Negros were better
during slavery times

16:04.823 --> 16:07.492
than they are today
because they worked harder then

16:07.492 --> 16:10.286

work hard now.

16:17.629 --> 16:19.590
slavery time is like one
of the most horrific, awful --

16:19.590 --> 16:22.760
it's like a genocide,
in my mind.

16:22.760 --> 16:24.303
It's like the Holocaust
for a Jew.

16:24.303 --> 16:26.014
So to be like, "Hey,

16:26.014 --> 16:27.558
the Jews were better
back in the Holocaust"

16:27.558 --> 16:29.351
is sort of like -- it's
a big punch in the gut.

16:29.351 --> 16:31.813
What he was saying
was that a lot of people

16:31.813 --> 16:34.274
have traded one form of slavery
for another form of slavery.

16:34.274 --> 16:38.445
When you're hooked
on the welfare system,

16:38.445 --> 16:39.823
it is a form of slavery,

16:39.823 --> 16:41.616
because it's very hard to get
off of it once you're on it.

16:41.616 --> 16:44.954

more white women on welfare

16:44.954 --> 16:47.331

to get me to apologize

16:53.006 --> 16:55.092

16:55.092 --> 16:57.427
but let me tell you,

16:57.427 --> 16:59.638
I would apologize to you,

16:59.638 --> 17:01.265

too general.
