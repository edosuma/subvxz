00:06.800 --> 00:09.400

00:09.400 --> 00:12.400
general manager, Paige.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.733
Wow! Oh, oh, oh!

00:14.733 --> 00:15.600
Yes!

00:15.600 --> 00:17.033
Now I get to dive into

00:17.033 --> 00:18.266
something completely different.

00:18.266 --> 00:21.500
I'm back!

00:21.500 --> 00:22.433
Tonight on <i>Total</i>

00:22.433 --> 00:22.933
Divas...

00:22.933 --> 00:23.733
I'm throwing a

00:23.733 --> 00:24.233
barbecue.

00:24.233 --> 00:25.233
You are not a good

00:25.233 --> 00:25.966
hostess.

00:26.500 --> 00:27.766
Come on in.

00:27.766 --> 00:28.900
My mom is coming.

00:28.900 --> 00:29.633
She's got all the meat.

00:29.633 --> 00:31.500
To Nattie! Yeah!

00:31.500 --> 00:32.600
Lana's not answering

00:32.600 --> 00:33.133
her phone.

00:33.133 --> 00:33.900
I'm over it.

00:33.900 --> 00:34.966
I'm gonna set you up

00:34.966 --> 00:35.633
with my brother.

00:35.633 --> 00:37.300
Nia hasn't stopped

00:37.300 --> 00:39.000
harassing me about her brother.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.733
Oh, God, ugh. It's hot.

00:41.233 --> 00:43.000
I just don't think I'm ready to

00:43.000 --> 00:45.666
be going on dates with anybody.

00:45.666 --> 00:47.000
Got it.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.200
It's the most

00:48.200 --> 00:49.566
nutrient‐dense source of food.

00:49.566 --> 00:50.700
I tried to breastfeed

00:50.700 --> 00:52.366
her and I just had no milk.

00:52.366 --> 00:53.366
Motherhood doesn't prepare you

00:53.366 --> 00:54.600
for that, and I was, like,

00:54.600 --> 00:56.000
"Whoa, Bird, like, we're never

00:56.000 --> 00:57.766
gonna share that experience

00:57.766 --> 01:00.940
again."

Pawzy, can I share

some with you?

01:27.073 --> 01:28.306
Teej, Pawz and I are sharing

01:28.306 --> 01:28.806
yogurt.

01:28.806 --> 01:29.873
He loves it.

01:29.873 --> 01:31.006
We just had yogurt

01:31.006 --> 01:31.940
together.

01:31.940 --> 01:33.706
Um, so I'm throwing a barbecue.

01:33.706 --> 01:34.706
You are?

01:34.706 --> 01:35.840
I didn't realize you're, like,

01:35.840 --> 01:36.606
throwing a barbecue.

01:36.606 --> 01:37.740
I was having a

01:37.740 --> 01:39.073
barbecue because I haven't been

01:39.073 --> 01:40.106
home in weeks.

01:40.106 --> 01:41.240
So you decided to

01:41.240 --> 01:42.373
celebrate that with a big

01:42.373 --> 01:43.040
barbecue bash?

01:43.040 --> 01:44.173
It's much easier for

01:44.173 --> 01:45.606
me to throw a barbecue and have

01:45.606 --> 01:47.240
everybody come here than me do

01:47.240 --> 01:48.440
little individual appointments

01:48.440 --> 01:49.140
with everyone.

01:49.140 --> 01:49.806
Okay.

01:49.806 --> 01:50.540
There's about 18

01:50.540 --> 01:51.840
people coming, not including you

01:51.840 --> 01:53.173
or me, almost 20.

01:53.173 --> 01:53.673
Mm.

01:53.673 --> 01:54.506
I know you think that

01:54.506 --> 01:55.506
I'm a terrible hostess, but I

01:55.506 --> 01:56.506
want to do something nice for

01:56.506 --> 01:57.206
everyone. I‐I...

01:57.206 --> 01:58.206
You are not a good

01:58.206 --> 01:58.873
hostess.

02:00.513 --> 02:01.680
TJ, I hope you're

02:01.680 --> 02:02.346
just joking.

02:02.346 --> 02:04.280
When was I a hostess?

02:04.280 --> 02:06.046
Our schedules in the WWE are

02:06.046 --> 02:07.813
very sporadic.

02:07.813 --> 02:09.880
Natalya!

02:12.646 --> 02:13.913
On average, we're

02:13.913 --> 02:15.846
only home maybe two days a week,

02:15.846 --> 02:17.513
and sometimes we don't come home

02:17.513 --> 02:19.646
for weeks at a time.

02:19.646 --> 02:21.580
It just depends on if we're on

02:21.580 --> 02:23.080
tour or if we're doing

02:23.080 --> 02:24.746
promotional work or if we have

02:24.746 --> 02:26.713
media.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.046
Sharpshooter's in.

02:28.046 --> 02:30.946
So I am just not your

02:30.946 --> 02:32.546
domesticated goddess.

02:32.546 --> 02:34.080
Last time we had a little

02:34.080 --> 02:34.846
get‐together...

02:34.846 --> 02:35.880
Well, last time...

02:35.880 --> 02:37.180
Titus was here, Truth was

02:37.180 --> 02:38.846
jumping up on the island.

02:38.846 --> 02:40.546
He thought Pawz was violently

02:40.546 --> 02:42.513
attacking him.

02:42.513 --> 02:43.680
Sometimes I wish I

02:43.680 --> 02:46.313
was better with cooking and, you

02:46.313 --> 02:48.580
know, hosting parties and being

02:48.580 --> 02:49.746
the hostess with the mostest.

02:49.746 --> 02:51.080
No! No, no, no, no!

02:51.080 --> 02:51.913
Get the cat.

02:51.913 --> 02:52.413
No!

02:52.413 --> 02:53.213
I'm finna go, Nattie.

02:53.213 --> 02:54.046
No, we're getting the

02:54.046 --> 02:54.546
cat.

02:54.546 --> 02:55.546
Y'all got too many

02:55.546 --> 02:56.880
cats, uh‐uh.

02:56.880 --> 02:57.780
Why are we kicking

02:57.780 --> 02:58.646
everyone out?

02:58.646 --> 02:59.313
Nattie, it's

02:59.313 --> 02:59.986
embarrassing.

02:59.986 --> 03:02.586
Hold on.

03:02.586 --> 03:03.753
It's on fire.

03:03.753 --> 03:04.886
This is too high.

03:04.886 --> 03:06.253
We're burning all the food.

03:06.253 --> 03:07.920
But I need TJ to have confidence

03:07.920 --> 03:08.453
in me.

03:08.453 --> 03:09.920
I need TJ to believe in me that

03:09.920 --> 03:11.220
I'm not going to burn what we're

03:11.220 --> 03:11.886
cooking.

03:11.886 --> 03:13.086
I mean, I have burnt what we

03:13.086 --> 03:14.220
were cooking in the past, but

03:14.220 --> 03:15.153
that doesn't mean I'm gonna do

03:15.153 --> 03:15.953
it today.

03:15.953 --> 03:17.086
I don't appreciate you calling

03:17.086 --> 03:18.786
me a hostess.

03:18.786 --> 03:20.220
No, I said not the worst,

03:20.220 --> 03:21.886
but far from the best.

03:21.886 --> 03:23.353
So somewhere in that middle.

03:23.353 --> 03:24.486
Well, you know what?

03:24.486 --> 03:25.820
TJ, let me redeem myself in this

03:25.820 --> 03:26.486
barbecue.

03:26.486 --> 03:26.986
Okay. Okay.

03:26.986 --> 03:27.786
It'll be nice to see

03:27.786 --> 03:28.553
everyone, I‐I mean...

03:28.553 --> 03:30.753
Okay, okay.

03:30.753 --> 03:31.686
Basically I'm gonna

03:31.686 --> 03:32.920
show you that I'm better than

03:32.920 --> 03:34.353
effing Martha Stewart.

03:34.353 --> 03:37.820
Okay, pr‐prove me wrong.

03:37.820 --> 03:38.953
I'm planning on it.

03:38.953 --> 03:40.086
I'm trying to motivate

03:40.086 --> 03:41.386
you to prove me wrong.

03:41.386 --> 03:42.320
I'm an amazing

03:42.320 --> 03:43.553
hostess, and I'm gonna prove to

03:43.553 --> 03:45.286
you in every way that I am.

03:45.286 --> 03:46.720
Lana's gonna be in the area, and

03:46.720 --> 03:47.620
you know what, I'm gonna invite

03:47.620 --> 03:48.653
her and show you what a great

03:48.653 --> 03:49.420
hostess I am.

03:51.120 --> 03:51.786
I'm just...

03:51.786 --> 03:52.520
Hello?

03:52.520 --> 03:53.920
Hey.

03:53.920 --> 03:54.753
Hey.

03:54.753 --> 03:56.186
How are you?

03:56.186 --> 03:57.320
I'm good.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.453
I just got a really good

03:58.453 --> 03:59.120
workout in.

03:59.120 --> 03:59.960
Oh, good.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.160
How was the performance center?

04:01.160 --> 04:02.160
It was great to be

04:02.160 --> 04:02.660
there.

04:02.660 --> 04:04.093
It was great to be training in

04:04.093 --> 04:05.426
the ring with Ember and other

04:05.426 --> 04:06.093
people.

04:06.093 --> 04:06.893
I know you're, like,

04:06.893 --> 04:08.493
an hour and a bit away, but I'm

04:08.493 --> 04:09.960
throwing a barbecue, and I would

04:09.960 --> 04:11.393
just love for you to be here.

04:11.393 --> 04:12.393
Oh, my gosh, I would

04:12.393 --> 04:13.326
love that.

04:13.326 --> 04:14.093
Yeah, so...

04:14.093 --> 04:15.193
I would love that,

04:15.193 --> 04:15.860
really.

04:15.860 --> 04:17.125
Oh, my gosh, I'm so excited.

04:17.125 --> 04:18.660
TJ's so excited, too.

04:18.660 --> 04:19.660
Oh, yay.

04:19.660 --> 04:20.892
If you want, I don't

04:20.892 --> 04:22.293
know if you want to or not, but

04:22.293 --> 04:23.560
I have a spare bedroom.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.460
So if you want to spend the

04:25.460 --> 04:27.293
night, I have a room that has a

04:27.293 --> 04:29.026
beautiful MacKenzie‐Childs couch

04:29.026 --> 04:30.693
in it that was imported from

04:30.693 --> 04:31.560
Scotland.

04:31.560 --> 04:32.626
Really? Perfect.

04:32.626 --> 04:33.559
All right, love you.

04:33.559 --> 04:34.693
Can't wait to see you.

04:34.693 --> 04:35.626
Love you, too.

04:35.626 --> 04:37.059
If I am ever gonna prove myself

04:37.059 --> 04:38.826
as a hostess, it's hosting a

04:38.826 --> 04:40.493
barbecue in my home and having

04:40.493 --> 04:42.793
Lana stay over at the same time.

04:42.793 --> 04:44.726
If I can do that, I'm pretty

04:44.726 --> 04:46.393
sure that I can solve world

04:46.393 --> 04:47.260
peace.

04:47.260 --> 04:49.160

17:48.020 --> 17:49.787
Thad, dawg, come in.

17:49.787 --> 17:50.620
We brought a back‐up

17:50.620 --> 17:51.387
plan.

17:51.387 --> 17:52.120
Oh, you did?

17:52.120 --> 17:53.520
Yeah.

17:53.520 --> 17:54.220
Brought our own barbecue.

17:54.220 --> 17:54.987
You'll never guess

17:54.987 --> 17:55.853
who just arrived.

17:55.853 --> 17:56.853
We brought our own

17:56.853 --> 17:58.253
barbecue, too, from 4 Rivers.

17:58.253 --> 17:59.587
Just in case.

17:59.587 --> 18:00.793
Well, my mom is

18:00.793 --> 18:01.460
coming.

18:01.460 --> 18:03.427
She's got all the meat.

18:03.427 --> 18:04.193
Let's do this.

18:04.193 --> 18:05.493
Before Nattie freaks

18:05.493 --> 18:06.327
out.

18:06.327 --> 18:07.693
Let's just start

18:07.693 --> 18:08.860
throwing what we need into a

18:08.860 --> 18:09.693
cart.

18:09.693 --> 18:10.560
Let's just make this

18:10.560 --> 18:12.193
snappy.

18:12.193 --> 18:13.227
Let's get a whole bunch of hot

18:13.227 --> 18:14.127
dogs.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.893
I mean, 20 people we're dealing

18:15.893 --> 18:16.760
with.

18:16.760 --> 18:17.760
Here, the more the merrier,

18:17.760 --> 18:18.460
right?

18:18.460 --> 18:19.693
We can't do a big lamb

18:19.693 --> 18:20.827
like that, that...

18:20.827 --> 18:22.027
She wanted a whole

18:22.027 --> 18:22.693
bunch of meat.

18:22.693 --> 18:23.527
No, that's not gonna

18:23.527 --> 18:24.027
work.

18:24.027 --> 18:25.160
You guys got to be real.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.060
Let's do some more.

18:26.060 --> 18:27.927
This is just a bunch of meat.

18:27.927 --> 18:28.760
I think that ought to

18:28.760 --> 18:29.260
do it.

18:29.260 --> 18:30.193
That's enough to feed André the

18:30.193 --> 18:30.993
Giant.

18:31.660 --> 18:32.927
Well, Nattie's making

18:32.927 --> 18:34.127
it sound like it's the end of

18:34.127 --> 18:35.227
the world, so I want to make

18:35.227 --> 18:36.427
sure we have tons of meat.

18:36.427 --> 18:37.427
I think we got lots

18:37.427 --> 18:38.093
now.

18:38.093 --> 18:39.893
That should be good.

18:39.893 --> 18:40.727
There's no beer here.

18:40.727 --> 18:41.793
Oh, good.

18:41.793 --> 18:42.793
There's no beer, so

18:42.793 --> 18:43.860
we're gonna take you to a bar,

18:43.860 --> 18:44.993
and we're gonna have a drink,

18:44.993 --> 18:47.227
because God knows, we need a

18:47.227 --> 18:48.127
drink before we deal with

18:48.127 --> 18:49.160
Nattie.

18:49.160 --> 18:50.260
We all know we're gonna get to

18:50.260 --> 18:52.360
this party and Nattie's gonna be

18:52.360 --> 18:54.593
extremely stressed, and we want

18:54.593 --> 18:55.827

18:55.827 --> 18:58.093

19:05.800 --> 19:07.833
Is this our car?

19:07.833 --> 19:08.500
I saw...

19:08.500 --> 19:09.333
I don't think this is

19:09.333 --> 19:10.000
our car.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.067
Oh, I'm sorry, that's

19:11.067 --> 19:12.100
why it didn't look familiar.

19:13.667 --> 19:14.567

19:21.800 --> 19:22.300
Mm‐hmm.

19:22.300 --> 19:23.133
Lana's supposed to be

19:26.133 --> 19:26.800

23:23.327 --> 23:24.393
You're at my house.

23:24.393 --> 23:25.760
You're sleeping in my bed.

23:25.760 --> 23:27.493
You're using my toilet paper.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.027
This is not acceptable.

23:29.027 --> 23:30.260
Lana, I'm on my way to get you

23:30.260 --> 23:31.660
guys right now.

23:31.660 --> 23:32.993
I don't have this meat because

23:32.993 --> 23:35.293
Lana thought she was gonna be

23:35.293 --> 23:37.493
Sophia Loren with my parents.

23:37.493 --> 23:38.593
Lana.

23:38.593 --> 23:39.793
We love you!

23:39.793 --> 23:40.627

23:40.627 --> 23:41.260
mad.

They're five minutes down the

Hi, how are you?

27:11.397 --> 27:13.597
My name is Rachelle

27:13.597 --> 27:14.964
and I'm a local lactation

27:14.964 --> 27:16.697
consultant and have worked with

27:16.697 --> 27:18.464
moms for almost 20 years now.

27:18.464 --> 27:19.697
Does anyone have any specific

27:19.697 --> 27:21.264
goals with weaning?

27:21.264 --> 27:22.631
My first, at 12

27:22.631 --> 27:23.697
months, was done.

27:23.697 --> 27:24.797
She was done.

27:24.797 --> 27:26.564
Now, my 13‐month‐old is, like,

27:26.564 --> 27:27.697
ravenous.

27:27.697 --> 27:29.864
Like, grabbing onto my shirt and

27:29.864 --> 27:31.264
it's hard.

27:31.264 --> 27:32.297
My breast milk's taken

27:32.297 --> 27:33.297
a huge dip.

27:33.297 --> 27:35.064
I used to have enough where I'd

27:35.064 --> 27:36.064
donate.

27:36.064 --> 27:36.731
Mm‐hmm.

27:36.731 --> 27:37.731
And now I realize in

27:37.731 --> 27:38.797
the last month that I can't even

27:38.797 --> 27:40.164
keep up with her during the day,

27:40.164 --> 27:41.497
so I've had to introduce, like,

27:41.497 --> 27:42.931
one bottle of formula a day.

27:42.931 --> 27:44.931
I'm trying to pump and do all

27:44.931 --> 27:45.997
this stuff, but it's the stress.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.564
I hate pumping.

27:47.564 --> 27:48.664
To the point, like, it makes me

27:48.664 --> 27:50.397
feel bad when I'm doing it

27:50.397 --> 27:51.631
because I'm so miserable.

27:51.631 --> 27:52.464
So miserable doing

27:52.464 --> 27:53.264
it, yeah.

27:53.264 --> 27:53.931
You know, the guilt

27:53.931 --> 27:54.864
always, like, plays in which

27:54.864 --> 27:56.131
is... mom guilt's the worst

27:56.131 --> 27:58.031
feeling in the world.

27:58.031 --> 27:59.871
And that's the

27:59.871 --> 28:00.871
emotion part.

28:00.871 --> 28:01.871
The emotional part's the hard

28:01.871 --> 28:03.104
part with that.

28:03.104 --> 28:05.104
The food is a nice bonus, but

28:05.104 --> 28:06.837
not always the main reason they

28:06.837 --> 28:07.904
nurse.

28:07.904 --> 28:09.771
They're nursing because it's

28:09.771 --> 28:11.471
liquid love.

28:11.471 --> 28:12.571
Breastfeeding is

28:12.571 --> 28:15.571
extremely hard, but I love the

28:15.571 --> 28:17.137
bond with Birdie.

28:17.137 --> 28:18.771
And I'm one of those people who,

28:18.771 --> 28:20.504
I'm like, "Oh, my gosh, my body

28:20.504 --> 28:22.604
is feeding my child."

28:22.604 --> 28:23.971
But at the same time, I don't

28:23.971 --> 28:25.171
want to lose myself.

28:25.171 --> 28:26.171
I‐I don't want to lose my

28:26.171 --> 28:27.171
career.

28:27.171 --> 28:28.271
I want to balance both.

28:28.271 --> 28:29.337
And that's what I thought

28:29.337 --> 28:30.471
pumping could do.

28:30.471 --> 28:32.904
I thought pumping could balance

28:32.904 --> 28:35.704
Birdie and my job, but it's not

28:35.704 --> 28:36.704
working.

28:36.704 --> 28:38.237
And it's weird how you just

28:38.237 --> 28:39.237
constantly feel like you're

28:39.237 --> 28:40.437
failing.

28:40.437 --> 28:41.571
You know, one thing

28:41.571 --> 28:43.204
that I hear a lot is, "Oh, you

28:43.204 --> 28:45.604
know, weaning, lots of tears."

28:45.604 --> 28:47.737
Well, for my first, the tears

28:47.737 --> 28:49.071
came from me because I wasn't

28:49.071 --> 28:50.837
ready for the weaning, but he

28:50.837 --> 28:52.037
was done.

28:52.037 --> 28:53.037
You can customize

28:53.037 --> 28:54.371
it exactly to what works for you

28:54.371 --> 28:55.837
and baby.

28:55.837 --> 28:59.071
Well...

28:59.071 --> 29:00.811
These women make me feel like

29:00.811 --> 29:03.244
it's okay if you don't want to

29:03.244 --> 29:04.611
breastfeed anymore or it's okay

29:04.611 --> 29:06.077
to still balance it.

29:06.077 --> 29:07.611
To have other women just be

29:07.611 --> 29:09.311
like, "You do you. That's all

29:09.311 --> 29:10.511
you have to do."

29:10.511 --> 29:11.644
I haven't felt that in a while,

29:11.644 --> 29:13.777
so it just... it means a lot to

29:13.777 --> 29:14.544
me right now.

29:14.544 --> 29:15.244
Thank you all for

29:15.244 --> 29:16.244
coming today.

29:16.244 --> 29:17.511
No, thank you.

29:17.511 --> 29:18.577
It's always fun to

31:38.104 --> 31:39.771
this big ordeal.

31:39.771 --> 31:41.271
Thank God for Titus.

31:41.271 --> 31:42.738
Thank God Titus has no faith in

31:44.771 --> 31:45.804
He has his potatoes.

31:45.804 --> 31:47.204
He has coleslaw.

31:47.204 --> 31:48.671
He has potato salad.

31:48.671 --> 31:50.804
I mean, Titus brought the whole

31:50.804 --> 31:52.204
kit and kaboodle.

31:52.204 --> 31:54.238
So, Nattie is the

31:54.238 --> 31:56.904
first person ever in my 41 years

31:56.904 --> 31:59.604
of living to invite me and my

31:59.604 --> 32:02.244
family over for a barbecue and

32:02.244 --> 32:04.944
there was not one vegetable

32:04.944 --> 32:07.644
cooked and not one piece of meat

32:07.644 --> 32:09.744
cooked at the actual house that

32:09.744 --> 32:11.344
I was invited to.

32:11.344 --> 32:13.278
In all seriousness, I love this

32:13.278 --> 32:15.411
woman for everything she does

32:15.411 --> 32:16.678
both inside and outside of the

32:16.678 --> 32:17.711
ring.

32:17.711 --> 32:19.211
And she can't cook worth a damn,

32:19.211 --> 32:20.378
but she gave it her best effort

32:20.378 --> 32:21.378
today.

32:21.378 --> 32:22.378
I love her.

32:22.378 --> 32:23.044
I love you, too.

32:23.044 --> 32:23.711

32:23.711 --> 32:24.544
I'm sorry that things

32:24.544 --> 32:25.044
didn't...

32:25.044 --> 32:25.778
Now go ahead, you can

32:25.778 --> 32:26.444
say it now.

32:26.444 --> 32:27.411
Despite the fact that

32:27.411 --> 32:28.778
the barbecue won't turn on,

32:28.778 --> 32:29.878
despite the fact that I have

32:29.878 --> 32:32.578
$300 of meat in my possession

32:32.578 --> 32:33.778
that was just on the floor of a

32:33.778 --> 32:34.778
dirty bar...

drunk with Lana.

32:42.211 --> 32:43.611
Everybody seems to be enjoying

32:43.611 --> 32:45.544
themselves and...

32:45.544 --> 32:46.711
...maybe I just need to relax

32:46.711 --> 32:49.211

32:49.211 --> 32:50.044

33:00.718 --> 33:01.984
talking about.

33:01.984 --> 33:02.718
So I can't cook.

33:02.718 --> 33:03.584
So what?

33:03.584 --> 33:04.418
I mean, I'm never really gonna

33:04.418 --> 33:05.451
be a traditional spouse.

33:05.451 --> 33:06.484
That's not me.

33:06.484 --> 33:07.718
But I will tell you one thing.

33:07.718 --> 33:09.451
I could throw a great dropkick,

33:09.451 --> 33:12.651
and that I am proud of.

33:12.651 --> 33:13.684
I really believe that's one of

33:13.684 --> 33:15.318
my strengths: bringing people

33:15.318 --> 33:17.518
together, enjoying the moment,

33:17.518 --> 33:18.684
and having quality time

33:18.684 --> 33:19.684
together.

33:19.684 --> 33:21.251
I put so much pressure on myself

33:21.251 --> 33:22.484
to make everybody happy all the

33:22.484 --> 33:24.084
time, and at the end of the day,

33:24.084 --> 33:25.151
we didn't have a great barbecue

33:25.151 --> 33:27.518

34:31.824 --> 34:32.791
maybe a second little date with

34:32.791 --> 34:34.623
other people around might, you

34:34.623 --> 34:36.257

It makes me happy, I'm so happy.

35:31.364 --> 35:33.264

35:33.264 --> 35:35.531
waiting to happen.

35:38.431 --> 35:39.764
That'd be a cute little picture.

35:39.764 --> 35:40.598
Look at that.

35:40.598 --> 35:41.498
Look how cute they look.

35:43.464 --> 35:45.498
That's gonna be framed

35:45.498 --> 35:46.864

35:46.864 --> 35:47.764
You don't have to do

35:47.764 --> 35:48.731
live events, right?

35:48.731 --> 35:49.431
No.

35:49.431 --> 35:50.364

35:50.364 --> 35:51.164

35:51.164 --> 35:52.098
I have a lot of free

35:52.098 --> 35:52.798
time.

35:52.798 --> 35:53.698
Ben can take you places,

35:53.698 --> 35:54.564
like, in Orlando.

35:54.564 --> 35:56.098
'Cause he's here.

35:56.098 --> 35:58.098
It'd be cool.

35:58.098 --> 35:59.264
Quite frankly, I

35:59.264 --> 36:00.704
just, I don't see the love

36:00.704 --> 36:01.404
connection.

36:01.404 --> 36:04.071
At all.

36:04.071 --> 36:05.838
She's literally sitting next to

36:05.838 --> 36:07.571
Ben like this.

36:07.571 --> 36:09.571
And I'm hoping Nia gets the

36:09.571 --> 36:10.638
hint.

36:10.638 --> 36:11.538
Are you guys still

36:11.538 --> 36:12.504
doing good over here?

36:12.504 --> 36:13.404
Aren't they cute?

36:13.404 --> 36:14.104
Yes. You guys

36:14.104 --> 36:15.371
should definitely go on a date.

36:18.871 --> 36:20.371
She's on another level

It's just gotten to a point now

36:22.571 --> 36:24.104
where I'm just so frustrated.

36:24.104 --> 36:25.704
Like, Nia, how can you not see

36:25.704 --> 36:26.771
that me and Ben are not

36:26.771 --> 36:27.738
interested in each other?

36:27.738 --> 36:32.604
Oh. Excuse me.

36:32.604 --> 36:33.404
I think it's great.

36:33.404 --> 36:34.238
I think you guys are, like,

That's what you're

36:36.138 --> 36:36.804
picking up on?

36:36.804 --> 36:37.738
Yeah.

36:37.738 --> 36:38.671
Do you not see this?

36:38.671 --> 36:39.404

She's hot.

36:46.838 --> 36:47.838
What do you mean?

36:47.838 --> 36:48.771
She's so pretty.

38:34.143 --> 38:35.277
Oh, God, my poor brother.

38:35.277 --> 38:36.677
It was ideal to think, like, she

38:36.677 --> 38:37.810
could possibly be my

38:37.810 --> 38:39.177
sister‐in‐law, but that was my

own selfish reasons.

38:40.610 --> 38:42.043
He is in a band,

business straightaway.

38:49.110 --> 38:50.110
All my relationships have always

38:50.110 --> 38:50.943
been, like, all over the

38:50.943 --> 38:51.843
Internet, and we just wanted to

38:51.843 --> 38:53.077
have a, like, finally have a

38:53.077 --> 38:54.277
private life.

38:54.277 --> 38:55.677
The year that you had, I

38:55.677 --> 38:57.677
100% agree for you to keep

38:57.677 --> 38:58.750
yourself private, for you to do

38:58.750 --> 38:59.817
your own thing.

38:59.817 --> 39:01.617
And then, like, try to have

39:01.617 --> 39:02.650
somewhat of your own personal

39:02.650 --> 39:03.650
life and not, like, have

39:03.650 --> 39:05.783
everybody dictate what you do.

39:05.783 --> 39:07.950
I feel guilty, not for

39:07.950 --> 39:09.750
keeping it a secret from anyone

39:09.750 --> 39:10.783
else, but for keeping it a

39:10.783 --> 39:11.917
secret from Nia because she is

39:11.917 --> 39:13.617
my best friend, and she deserves

39:13.617 --> 39:14.617
to know.

39:14.617 --> 39:15.783
I've been open about every

39:15.783 --> 39:16.917
single one of my relationships,

39:16.917 --> 39:18.350
and now I've got to an age where

39:18.350 --> 39:19.950
I'm like, "I don't want to do

39:19.950 --> 39:20.917
that now."

39:20.917 --> 39:21.950
And, like, in the last year and

39:21.950 --> 39:22.883
a half, people have seen me very

39:22.883 --> 39:23.683
vulnerable, and that's not like

39:23.683 --> 39:24.683
me whatsoever.

39:24.683 --> 39:26.650
So I never want people to see me

39:26.650 --> 39:27.850
that way ever again.

39:27.850 --> 39:29.383
I'm feeling good.

39:29.383 --> 39:30.617

41:38.630 --> 41:39.697
giving your baby breast milk,

41:39.697 --> 41:40.897
it's like you feel like you're

41:40.897 --> 41:42.063
failing your child.

41:42.063 --> 41:43.063
And it's kind of embarrassing to

41:43.063 --> 41:44.230
tell other women, like...

41:44.230 --> 41:45.163
Yeah. I think when the

41:45.163 --> 41:46.697
time is up, the time is up.

41:46.697 --> 41:48.597
But I was kind of

41:48.597 --> 41:49.597
embarrassed to tell you 'cause

41:49.597 --> 41:50.797
I feel like you'd be upset.

41:50.797 --> 41:51.797
Me? No, I'm not upset

41:51.797 --> 41:53.097
at all.

41:53.097 --> 41:54.130
I think you've done an

41:54.130 --> 41:55.997
incredible job.

41:55.997 --> 41:57.230
Look at how big and healthy she

41:57.230 --> 41:58.603
is.

41:58.603 --> 41:59.337
Yeah, I mean, she does

41:59.337 --> 42:00.137
love food.

42:00.137 --> 42:01.237
Maybe she's the one

42:01.237 --> 42:02.837
saying, "You know what, Mommy?

42:02.837 --> 42:04.570
I appreciate all the things that

42:04.570 --> 42:06.303
you've given me, but now you

42:06.303 --> 42:07.903
don't need to breastfeed me

42:07.903 --> 42:08.903
anymore because I'm so healthy."

42:08.903 --> 42:10.203
It's not like you're just

42:10.203 --> 42:11.570
choosing to go off.

42:11.570 --> 42:12.303
And even if you did choose to go

42:12.303 --> 42:13.903
off, that's a woman's choice,

42:13.903 --> 42:14.937
right?

42:14.937 --> 42:15.870
Yeah.

42:15.870 --> 42:17.770
You've done the best

42:17.770 --> 42:19.270
that you could, and more than

42:19.270 --> 42:20.570
anyone could have ever asked of

42:20.570 --> 42:21.737
you, especially given how busy

42:21.737 --> 42:22.903
your schedule is.

42:22.903 --> 42:24.037
Yeah.

42:24.037 --> 42:25.037
Well, it makes me feel good that

42:25.037 --> 42:26.703
you're okay with it.

42:26.703 --> 42:27.603
Yeah.

42:27.603 --> 42:29.270
I can't believe how

42:29.270 --> 42:30.570
Bryan is taking it.

42:30.570 --> 42:31.703
Him just being supportive, like,

42:31.703 --> 42:32.637
means the world.

42:32.637 --> 42:34.570
It really helps me just

42:34.570 --> 42:36.003
understand that, like, "Brie,

42:36.003 --> 42:37.103
this is okay.

42:37.103 --> 42:38.203
This is life."

42:38.203 --> 42:39.337
I guess we're going into the

42:39.337 --> 42:40.903
next stage of life, Bir‐Bir.

42:40.903 --> 42:42.603
Next stage of life.

42:42.603 --> 42:44.237
Yay!

42:44.237 --> 42:45.603
It was good that my

42:45.603 --> 42:48.170
body and Birdie decided, because

42:48.170 --> 42:49.670
it is their decision.

42:49.670 --> 42:51.337
And I don't have to always be in

42:51.337 --> 42:52.637
control.

42:52.637 --> 42:55.303
But it is crazy, like...

42:55.303 --> 42:57.137
You know, you just never know

42:57.137 --> 42:58.643
when it's the last time for

42:58.643 --> 42:59.277
something.

42:59.277 --> 43:00.577
They grow so fast.

43:00.577 --> 43:02.310
Here's Birdie!

43:02.310 --> 43:03.343
Bird.

43:03.343 --> 43:04.577
Peek‐a‐boo.

43:04.577 --> 43:07.110
There she is.

43:07.110 --> 43:08.077
There she is.

43:08.077 --> 43:09.810
My sweetheart.

43:09.810 --> 43:12.610
One, two, three...

43:13.343 --> 43:14.277
Next week on <i>Total</i>

43:14.277 --> 43:15.277
Divas...

43:15.277 --> 43:16.077
We have some aggression

43:16.077 --> 43:17.010
we need to take out.

43:17.010 --> 43:18.577
Lana's dying her hair

43:18.577 --> 43:19.277
hot pink.

43:19.277 --> 43:19.977
Oh, my God, are you

43:19.977 --> 43:20.677
kidding me?

43:20.677 --> 43:21.610
What's going on in here?

43:21.610 --> 43:24.577
Lana, are you serious right now?

43:24.577 --> 43:25.743
Look at this

43:25.743 --> 43:26.677
chair, you need to get in this

43:26.677 --> 43:27.277
chair.

43:27.277 --> 43:28.577
I've made mistakes in the past,

43:28.577 --> 43:29.243
which has made me a stronger

43:29.243 --> 43:30.710
person, I feel like.

43:30.710 --> 43:31.643
Public humiliation is no joke.

43:31.643 --> 43:34.577
I make the matches around here,

43:34.577 --> 43:36.577
thank you very much.
