- Hey!
It’s them!

07:55.876 --> 07:57.292
[both scream]

07:57.292 --> 07:58.959
[all shouting indistinctly]

07:58.959 --> 08:01.250
- Stop!
- Give them their money back.

08:01.250 --> 08:02.209
That’ll stop them.

08:02.209 --> 08:05.083
- Here!
Take it, you wild animals!

08:05.083 --> 08:07.000
[all yelling]

08:07.000 --> 08:08.792
- Huh, didn’t
stop them.

08:08.792 --> 08:11.292
- I know what to do.

08:11.292 --> 08:12.959
Free hugs!

08:12.959 --> 08:14.334
[all yelling]

08:14.334 --> 08:15.751
Uh,
on second thought,

08:15.751 --> 08:18.167
there may not be enough
of me to go around.

08:18.167 --> 08:21.000
[all yelling]

08:22.999 --> 08:24.083
[banging]

08:24.083 --> 08:26.876
[both panting]

08:27.751 --> 08:30.999
- Oh, boy.
What did you two do now?

08:30.999 --> 08:32.958
- L-L-L-Lori?

08:32.958 --> 08:35.999
[breathing sharply]

08:35.999 --> 08:37.999
[moaning]

08:37.999 --> 08:40.833
- Uh, you wouldn’t be
interested.

08:40.833 --> 08:42.876
- Oh, we’re interested.

08:42.876 --> 08:43.333
Spill!

08:43.333 --> 08:46.999
- Well, Clyde and I had to start
a business for school,

08:46.999 --> 08:48.999
so we kind of, uh,

08:48.999 --> 08:52.918
charged boys for my advice
about girls.

08:52.918 --> 08:55.999
[all laughing]

08:55.999 --> 08:59.167
- Go ahead; get it out
of your systems.

08:59.167 --> 09:01.292
[all laughing]

09:01.292 --> 09:02.959
Are you done now?

09:02.959 --> 09:04.375
- Uh...no.

09:04.375 --> 09:08.000
[all laughing]

09:08.000 --> 09:10.250
Lincoln, what do you
know about girls?

09:10.250 --> 09:14.209
- Well, I just thought
that since I had ten sisters--

09:14.209 --> 09:15.083
- What’s true for us

09:15.083 --> 09:16.999
isn’t gonna be true
for every girl.

09:16.999 --> 09:18.459
We’re not all the same.

09:18.459 --> 09:19.999
- I’m not like Lana!

09:19.999 --> 09:22.792
- And thank goodness
for that.

09:22.792 --> 09:24.250
- Oh, man,
you’re right.

09:24.250 --> 09:25.083
What have I done?

09:25.083 --> 09:26.292
I’ve doled out
terrible advice,

09:26.292 --> 09:28.918
and now everybody
at school hates us.

09:28.918 --> 09:30.417
How am I going
to fix this?

09:30.417 --> 09:32.334
- Uh, we better
figure something out.

09:32.334 --> 09:34.792
I’m running out
of paper bags.

09:34.792 --> 09:35.999
- A kitchen full of pie?

09:35.999 --> 09:38.999
I guess it’s ole Dad’s
lucky day!

09:38.999 --> 09:40.125
[laughs and gulps]

09:40.125 --> 09:41.292
[stomach grumbles]
Ooh, bad!

09:41.292 --> 09:44.125
- We went a little
overboard on the salt.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.000
- I’ll say.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.250
It’s an <i>assault</i>
on my senses.

09:48.250 --> 09:49.459
- [laughing]

09:49.459 --> 09:50.501
Good one, Dad.

09:50.501 --> 09:51.417
- Ah, sorry,
Lincoln.

09:51.417 --> 09:54.125
We’re just gonna have
to toss the whole batch.

09:54.125 --> 09:54.999
- Toss them?

09:54.999 --> 09:56.292
That’s a great idea,
dad.

09:56.292 --> 09:58.792
Clyde, we’re back
in business.

09:58.792 --> 10:01.375
How hard can it be
to start a business?

10:01.375 --> 10:02.250
Pretty hard, actually.

10:02.250 --> 10:05.209
The key is to find something
you’re really good at,

10:05.209 --> 10:08.292
and it turns out for me
that thing is...

10:08.292 --> 10:10.959
taking a pie
in the face.

10:10.959 --> 10:11.876
- Step right up

10:11.876 --> 10:14.876
and get your revenge
on the Girl Guru.

10:14.876 --> 10:16.042
$2.00 a pie.

10:16.042 --> 10:17.999
[all speaking at once]

10:17.999 --> 10:18.999
- Great job, boys!

10:18.999 --> 10:21.459
This is a fantastic
business idea!

10:21.459 --> 10:23.417
- Thanks,
Mrs. Johnson.

10:23.417 --> 10:26.417
- One pie, please.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.792
- And two for me.

10:28.792 --> 10:30.918
- You know,
we’re running a special.

10:30.918 --> 10:33.292
Buy four
and get the fifth free!

10:33.292 --> 10:34.209
- Ah, even better.

10:34.209 --> 10:35.999
Heck,
I’ll take them all!

10:35.999 --> 10:36.999
[cackling]
- Clyde!

10:36.999 --> 10:39.209
- Business is business,
Lincoln.

10:39.209 --> 10:41.834
Let ’er rip!

10:41.834 --> 10:44.334
- [gulps]
[pies splatting]
