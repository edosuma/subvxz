WEBVTT

00:00.976 --> 00:03.240
I'm Madison.
Nice to meet you. And you.

00:03.311 --> 00:04.971
You're on break with her.
Yes?

00:05.247 --> 00:06.271
Okay.

00:06.915 --> 00:08.439
That little bastard.

00:08.516 --> 00:10.541
The savings that we were
keeping for your college

00:10.619 --> 00:13.087
is the money I used
for the investment.

00:13.288 --> 00:15.916
I lost all the money and...
Where are you going?

00:16.024 --> 00:18.686
Don't! Don't touch me.
Please, don't leave me.

00:18.760 --> 00:22.218
I need to ask you a favor.
I'm taking the SATs on Saturday.

00:22.297 --> 00:25.664
I was kind of hoping, if you weren't doing
anything, if maybe you could, you know...

00:25.734 --> 00:27.258
Help you out?
Yeah.

00:27.335 --> 00:28.893
Landry's kind of cute up there.

00:28.970 --> 00:29.959
Yeah, I know.

00:30.639 --> 00:33.472
It's love or time...

00:36.311 --> 00:37.938
Hey, what about a sangria set?

00:38.013 --> 00:39.503
Oh, that's great.
Monkey, do you like that?

00:39.581 --> 00:41.776
Oh, yeah, if you like it, I like it.
I love it.

00:44.185 --> 00:45.209
Sangria, got it.

00:45.287 --> 00:47.152
You know what? I'm gonna
head over to Automotive.

00:47.222 --> 00:49.156
I think we can register
for, like, a leaf blower.

00:49.224 --> 00:50.816
How cool would that be?
That's a great idea.

00:50.892 --> 00:51.950
Why don't you take this
with you?

00:52.027 --> 00:53.858
You will not take
that with you.

00:53.929 --> 00:55.658
I'll be back in a sec.

00:55.897 --> 00:56.955
What, honey?

00:57.032 --> 01:00.661
What's the matter? I feel like I'm the only
one excited about your sister's wedding.

01:00.735 --> 01:04.727
Well, I'm just thinking about my SATs, okay?
I just have this feeling I did horrible.

01:04.806 --> 01:07.104
Oh, stop.
I'm sure you did fine, baby.

01:07.175 --> 01:08.472
You've been working so hard.

01:08.543 --> 01:11.671
I know, that's the point.
It's just important, that's all.

01:11.746 --> 01:15.477
Hello, ladies. Are we here to register
for my wedding? Can we do that?

01:15.550 --> 01:16.915
Bridal shower. Plans.

01:16.985 --> 01:20.683
Um, yes, called all your girlfriends
and called Seven Señoritas.

01:20.756 --> 01:23.725
No, I don't wanna go to Seven...
We always go to Seven Señoritas.

01:23.793 --> 01:26.523
The shower needs to
be different. Special.

01:26.595 --> 01:28.028
Honey, it will be special.

01:28.097 --> 01:30.588
All your girlfriends are gonna buy you
new thongs to replace the old ones.

01:30.666 --> 01:32.657
Let's do a tea.

01:35.037 --> 01:36.664
A tea?
Yeah.

01:37.573 --> 01:39.700
As in a tea party?
What?

01:39.775 --> 01:41.834
That seems like
it's a little bit square.

01:41.944 --> 01:43.377
Mama, it's classy.

01:43.479 --> 01:47.279
Class, yes, something you know a lot about.
Are you serious right now?

01:47.350 --> 01:49.648
My bridal shower's
gonna be a tea.

01:50.152 --> 01:51.551
Make that happen.

01:51.620 --> 01:54.282
Hey, ladies, look at this,
a leaf blower.

01:54.357 --> 01:55.722
Oh, my God!

01:59.595 --> 02:01.153
Red, 58!

02:01.230 --> 02:03.528
Red, 58!
Set, hut!

02:04.934 --> 02:07.129
Watch the move,
watch the move!

02:07.203 --> 02:09.033
Good job, J. D!
There you go.

02:09.104 --> 02:10.503
Good, run it again.

02:11.039 --> 02:13.508
Get down deep, get down deep!
Attaboy, J.D.

02:17.580 --> 02:19.946
There you go,
there you go, good work.

02:21.684 --> 02:23.447
Let's go, pick it up, let's go!

02:25.321 --> 02:26.515
All right, come on.

02:27.923 --> 02:29.254
All right, let's get
something to drink.

02:29.325 --> 02:30.417
Let's go, break.

02:30.793 --> 02:33.353
Come on, let's go!
Guys, let's get some Gatorade. You want one?

02:35.097 --> 02:36.291
Hey.

02:37.266 --> 02:38.290
Hey.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.028
You look pretty hot out there.

02:40.102 --> 02:43.094
Yeah, you know,
it's kind of warm out there.

02:43.506 --> 02:45.167
What the hell's that kid doing.

02:45.241 --> 02:47.436
Looks like he got himself
a little plaything, Coach.

02:47.676 --> 02:48.665
Hey, Wade.

02:49.211 --> 02:50.508
Why don't you go
get Romeo over there,

02:50.579 --> 02:53.207
tell him to get his head
back in the game, huh?

02:53.516 --> 02:56.110
Let's go, gentlemen,
let's go! Time's up!

02:56.185 --> 02:57.174
Go!

02:57.253 --> 02:58.914
I'll text you.
Okay, yeah.

02:58.988 --> 03:00.546
J.D. let's go.
J.D. man, let's go.

03:00.623 --> 03:02.022
Bye.
Bye.

03:02.091 --> 03:04.423
Excuse us, little lady,
we have a practice. Let's go.

03:05.594 --> 03:08.324
What's your problem, man?
You act like this is not State.

03:08.431 --> 03:10.524
Sorry. Get in there, get your
head in the game, let's go!

03:11.000 --> 03:11.989
J.D.

03:12.468 --> 03:15.528
On your own time.
On your own time, this is my time.

03:15.771 --> 03:16.931
Sorry, Coach.

03:17.006 --> 03:18.337
Let's go, gentlemen!

03:20.709 --> 03:22.973
You have no chance,
you have no chance.

03:23.846 --> 03:25.973
I am a chick, and I am winning.

03:26.048 --> 03:27.572
There's no rules.
That's cheating!

03:28.284 --> 03:29.478
Score!

03:29.618 --> 03:32.178
Three out of three,
she's schooling your ass!

03:32.254 --> 03:33.846
You can't push,
you're in the middle.

03:33.923 --> 03:35.982
Hey, you can, you can.

03:36.092 --> 03:37.616
It's the first time
she's ever played.

03:37.693 --> 03:40.457
You know what? I used to think she was
prissy, turns out you're kind of fun.

03:40.563 --> 03:43.896
You're a cheater, Garrity.
You know what? I want a rematch, though.

03:43.966 --> 03:47.299
You can have a rematch. Can you bring me
another one while you're over there, please?

03:48.737 --> 03:51.262
I'm clocking out.
Hitting the sheets.

03:52.875 --> 03:54.103
Wanna come?

03:54.176 --> 03:56.372
No, I have a rematch.

03:56.446 --> 03:58.505
Don't you
wanna watch?

03:59.349 --> 04:00.509
I'm good.

04:00.584 --> 04:01.642
Night, Grandpa.

04:01.718 --> 04:03.015
Push play, push play.
Come on, Garrity.

04:03.086 --> 04:04.519
I'm pushing play.
You ready?

04:04.588 --> 04:05.612
That's all that matters,
here we go.

04:05.689 --> 04:07.020
Wait, wait, Billy!

04:07.858 --> 04:09.120
You can't win.

04:59.976 --> 05:00.965
Hey, good morning.

05:01.044 --> 05:03.444
Hey, honey.
What time is that meeting tonight?

05:03.513 --> 05:09.281
It's at 6:00. Man, I cannot make heads or
tails out of all this redistricting business.

05:09.619 --> 05:13.680
You know, they try to do that every year,
redistricting, try to open up East Dillon High.

05:13.757 --> 05:15.918
Never happens and it's never gonna happen.
Where's the cream?

05:15.992 --> 05:19.223
I know, but you know what?
People are fed up this year, people want change.

05:19.296 --> 05:21.821
And I'll tell you one thing, right
now everything I'm reading tells me

05:21.898 --> 05:24.765
we will not get any funding from the state
unless we do it through redistricting.

05:24.834 --> 05:27.359
You know what?
People don't like confusion.

05:27.437 --> 05:30.497
And splitting a town in half,
that causes confusion.

05:30.574 --> 05:33.202
It's not gonna happen.
Where's the cream?

05:33.276 --> 05:36.177
Honey, we're out. You want some of mine?
It's real good.

05:36.246 --> 05:37.770
It's still hot.

05:40.850 --> 05:42.317
All right, beer wolf.

05:42.485 --> 05:45.454
I let you sleep in as long
as I could before we gotta go.

05:45.522 --> 05:48.980
For your favorite
day of academics.

05:49.092 --> 05:51.458
I think you got, what?
History?

05:52.896 --> 05:54.454
Time to get up, let's go.

05:54.531 --> 05:55.759
I'm not going.

05:55.832 --> 05:57.265
You don't wanna go?

05:57.334 --> 05:59.734
Fine, I'll stay here, but you're
not gonna get much sleep.

05:59.803 --> 06:03.068
I don't want any company,
I just want to be in bed.

06:03.273 --> 06:07.403
Last chance.
Okay, train's leaving.

06:09.179 --> 06:11.238
Seriously, train's leaving.

06:12.582 --> 06:13.810
I'm off.

06:16.319 --> 06:17.809
See you later.

06:19.222 --> 06:23.056
I have seven kinds of tea, all right?
It's gonna be magical, I promise you.

06:23.627 --> 06:24.651
Yes.

06:24.761 --> 06:26.786
You need to stop worrying.

06:27.197 --> 06:30.564
I have everything.
It's gonna be fine, all right?

06:30.734 --> 06:33.033
No, I know, I know.
No, don't...

06:33.971 --> 06:36.496
I gotta go.
All right, thank you, bye-bye.

06:41.212 --> 06:46.047
Excuse me, ma'am, but management just
told me to escort you off the premises.

06:47.618 --> 06:49.176
I wish somebody would.

06:49.720 --> 06:50.744
You okay?

06:50.821 --> 06:53.881
Yeah, totally, just planning
the bridal shower from hell.

06:53.958 --> 06:56.756
You know.
Mindy wants a tea party.

06:57.128 --> 06:58.925
Well, that's good.
That's exciting. Yeah.

06:58.996 --> 07:00.088
How are you doing?

07:00.164 --> 07:01.358
I'm doing good.

07:01.432 --> 07:05.926
I just found out the club owner asked
Crucifictorious back next week, so...

07:06.604 --> 07:08.595
That's great.
And hopefully if that goes well,

07:08.673 --> 07:10.834
we'll kind of do
like a regular thing,

07:10.908 --> 07:13.843
so, yeah, thank you
again for that, 'cause...

07:14.011 --> 07:16.002
We couldn't have done it
without you.

07:16.080 --> 07:18.571
You guys deserve it.
Good, I'm glad.

07:19.383 --> 07:20.577
Thanks.

07:21.385 --> 07:22.875
Well, I, uh...

07:23.220 --> 07:27.657
I have to get going, 'cause I have to
figure out how to make scones. So...

07:27.825 --> 07:30.521
My mom's got a scone recipe,
if you wanna use it.

07:30.594 --> 07:32.721
I'm sure she wouldn't mind.

07:33.531 --> 07:34.896
Was that...

07:35.466 --> 07:37.900
Was that, like,
an offer to help?

07:37.968 --> 07:41.404
Um, I guess, yeah.

07:41.472 --> 07:43.872
I guess that was
an offer to help.

07:43.941 --> 07:46.432
Thank you.
That would be awesome.

07:47.278 --> 07:48.711
Sure.

07:49.980 --> 07:53.973
I completely understand. You bet.
I will definitely talk to him.

07:54.051 --> 07:56.747
Mmm-hmm, no problem.
Well, thank you for calling.

07:57.421 --> 07:59.719
Who was that?
That was Wade Aikmen.

07:59.790 --> 08:04.693
J.D. has apparently been half-assing
it at practice last couple days.

08:04.762 --> 08:07.629
You know, I just don't believe that.
You know how hard he works.

08:07.698 --> 08:10.496
Well, not this week, baby.
Not this week, not today.

08:10.568 --> 08:14.265
Today, he is, quote,
"Not himself," unquote,

08:14.338 --> 08:15.805
because he is completely
distracted

08:15.873 --> 08:18.740
by a little 15-year-old minx
named Madison.

08:18.809 --> 08:20.674
That girl is a plague!
Oh, please!

08:20.745 --> 08:22.610
I cannot believe
that boy lied to me!

08:22.680 --> 08:23.908
He said that he would
cool things off,

08:23.981 --> 08:25.107
but, no,
he didn't cool nothing off.

08:25.182 --> 08:28.117
And you know what else?
I cannot believe you don't think it's a big deal

08:28.185 --> 08:31.086
he goes out and sneaks off
in the middle of the night.

08:31.155 --> 08:32.679
I do think it's a big deal.
You're not acting like it!

08:32.756 --> 08:34.554
You know what? I don't think
freaking out is helping anything.

08:34.625 --> 08:35.683
I'm not freaking out.
You are freaking out.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.092
I'm parenting.
Back off.

08:40.530 --> 08:41.861
Hi, honey.

08:44.034 --> 08:45.661
Gonna say hi to your mom?
Hey.

08:45.736 --> 08:47.067
How you doing?

08:47.405 --> 08:48.531
I'm good.
You all right?

08:48.606 --> 08:49.630
Yeah.

08:49.707 --> 08:50.833
How was practice?

08:50.908 --> 08:51.932
That was good, too.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.567
It was good, huh?
Yeah.

08:53.644 --> 08:57.444
Practice was practice, you know.
I got it under control. It's all good.

08:58.582 --> 09:00.447
What's for dinner?
Turkey burgers.

09:00.518 --> 09:02.349
Turkey burgers, really?
Yeah, your favorite.

09:02.420 --> 09:04.354
All right, well, cool, I'm gonna
go do some homework, all right?

09:04.422 --> 09:05.548
Okay.

09:07.225 --> 09:10.092
He's got it under control.
"It's all good.' '

09:13.365 --> 09:14.423
You good?
Get your seat belt on.

09:14.499 --> 09:17.662
Well, I know how to wear a seat
belt, thank you very much.

09:17.736 --> 09:19.431
Hey, do you need anything?
We're going to the market.

09:19.504 --> 09:20.801
No, I'm good.

09:20.872 --> 09:22.772
Grandma, be nice, okay?
And, listen,

09:22.841 --> 09:25.571
I know what we need at the market.
You didn't need to bother him with anything.

09:25.644 --> 09:28.511
I'm not bothering him. I just wanted
to see if he wanted anything special.

09:28.580 --> 09:30.207
And I didn't want to go now.

09:30.282 --> 09:33.115
I'm missing Oprah.
They're doing a life makeover.

09:33.185 --> 09:36.279
You ought to watch it.
Maybe you could learn something.

09:36.354 --> 09:39.016
Well, I promise I'll get you
back in time for the makeovers.

09:39.090 --> 09:40.785
My gosh, where's my purse?

09:40.859 --> 09:42.520
Where is my purse?

09:42.594 --> 09:44.755
I left my purse on the couch!
Oh, God, Lorraine!

09:47.566 --> 09:48.590
Oh, my God.

09:48.667 --> 09:52.194
Lorraine? Matt!
Lorraine, are you okay?

09:52.404 --> 09:54.463
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

09:54.739 --> 09:55.933
I'm sorry.

09:56.007 --> 09:57.031
Grandma, you okay?

09:57.108 --> 09:58.166
Oh, honey...

09:58.243 --> 10:00.040
Go call an ambulance
or something. Grandma!

10:00.111 --> 10:02.944
Are you all right?
Let's try and turn you over, okay?

10:04.082 --> 10:07.643
No, no, no. Okay, it's all right.
You're okay. Oh, honey.

10:08.119 --> 10:09.984
I'm sorry. No, don't be sorry.
You didn't do anything.

10:10.055 --> 10:13.218
I don't wanna be in trouble.
You're not in trouble, Grandma.

10:13.291 --> 10:15.316
Just... No, it's okay.

10:15.393 --> 10:18.157
Just try and breathe...
Okay, honey.

10:18.230 --> 10:21.222
And relax, all right?
We're gonna be fine, we're gonna be fine.

10:21.299 --> 10:23.199
I'm so sorry, honey.

10:30.342 --> 10:32.606
You want a soda or anything?
No.

10:37.682 --> 10:38.671
Hi.

10:39.050 --> 10:41.746
Hey, Matt. It's okay.
She's all right.

10:41.853 --> 10:44.014
A few contusions,
minor lacerations,

10:44.089 --> 10:46.922
but no stitches, that's the good part.
Oh, thank God.

10:47.158 --> 10:48.955
That's not the real
problem here, Matt.

10:49.094 --> 10:52.120
Your grandmother's mental
health is deteriorating.

10:52.197 --> 10:53.824
Now, look,
we've talked about this.

10:53.899 --> 10:57.357
I want you to seriously consider
other living arrangements.

10:57.435 --> 10:58.925
Other living arrangements,
like what?

10:59.004 --> 11:01.871
Lorraine should be in a place
where there are professionals

11:01.940 --> 11:03.567
who can be responsible for her.

11:03.642 --> 11:05.633
She needs that level of care.

11:05.710 --> 11:07.439
Well, let me get this straight.

11:07.512 --> 11:10.970
You said we should be looking for some
sort of assisted living for Lorraine?

11:11.049 --> 11:13.347
No, we're not
looking for anything.

11:13.451 --> 11:15.248
Okay, I know, but...

11:15.387 --> 11:16.445
The doctor just said...

11:16.521 --> 11:18.250
Look, just because
she fell out of a car

11:18.323 --> 11:21.315
that you were driving doesn't mean
that she needs 24-hour assistance.

11:21.393 --> 11:24.556
It means that you need to pay better attention
to her when you're taking care of her.

11:24.629 --> 11:26.859
Okay, you're right, I will.
I will, Matt, but you know what?

11:26.932 --> 11:29.924
What the doctor said made me think that
even if I'm paying great attention

11:30.001 --> 11:31.059
and you're there,
we still can't...

11:31.136 --> 11:33.468
Look, if you wanna bail
again, go ahead and bail.

11:33.538 --> 11:35.335
Go back to Oklahoma,
we don't need you.

11:35.407 --> 11:37.932
But, right now,
my grandmother has a home

11:38.009 --> 11:40.102
and I'm taking her to it, okay?
Come on, Matt.

11:40.178 --> 11:41.475
No. Where is she?
Wait, Matt.

11:41.546 --> 11:43.412
Is she back here?
No, Matt, wait. I'll take you.

11:43.482 --> 11:46.349
Just calm down a little bit, okay?
All right.

11:56.028 --> 11:58.155
Hey, Tim!
Come here.

12:02.501 --> 12:04.992
We need to have
a little man-to-man.

12:09.542 --> 12:11.874
I'm pretty sure we have a
good shot against West Cambria.

12:11.944 --> 12:14.845
Tim, you know I'm not
here to talk about football.

12:14.914 --> 12:16.939
I'm here to
talk about my daughter.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.644
How's she doing?

12:23.089 --> 12:25.023
She's hanging in there.

12:26.993 --> 12:29.052
Tim, I need to get Lyla back.

12:30.262 --> 12:34.255
Son, I don't know what to do.
I mean, I cannot go on

12:35.001 --> 12:39.665
thinking that she hates me.
And I cannot stand the fact that I've hurt her.

12:40.206 --> 12:42.766
And I miss her very, very much.

12:43.242 --> 12:45.472
Well, I know
she misses you, too.

12:45.544 --> 12:47.774
You know that?
Did she say that?

12:48.314 --> 12:49.406
Yes.

12:55.488 --> 12:56.512
I don't know what to do next.

12:56.589 --> 12:58.216
You gotta give her more time,

12:58.290 --> 13:00.554
Mr. Garrity,
that's what I think.

13:02.862 --> 13:04.489
That's good, Tim Riggins.

13:04.964 --> 13:08.195
That sounds like good advice.
That's what I'll do.

13:10.336 --> 13:11.496
You're a good man.

13:12.104 --> 13:14.129
Am I supposed to walk
from here, Mr. Garrity...

13:14.206 --> 13:16.231
Oh, no, no, I'll take you back.
Drive me home?

13:16.308 --> 13:18.936
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
I'll take you back.

13:20.946 --> 13:26.111
The current proposal uses Collier
Avenue as the dividing line

13:26.218 --> 13:27.685
between the two schools.

13:27.753 --> 13:29.880
Dillon High School in the blue,

13:29.955 --> 13:31.786
East Dillon High School
in yellow.

13:31.891 --> 13:35.554
Each high school will have
roughly 1,000 students,

13:35.628 --> 13:38.062
with class sizes capped at 21,

13:38.597 --> 13:42.033
and a 25% increase
in per-student funding.

13:43.202 --> 13:47.161
Thank you, Elaine. All right, I'd like to open
up the floor to any questions at this time.

13:47.239 --> 13:50.003
This whole thing sounds like
bureaucratic smoke and mirrors.

13:50.076 --> 13:52.670
Now, where's the pot of gold
that's gonna fund this pipe dream?

13:52.745 --> 13:54.736
The state's funding this,
Larry.

13:54.814 --> 13:57.180
If the majority approves,
and I hope they do,

13:57.249 --> 13:59.581
you're gonna be seeing this type
of thing happening all over Texas.

13:59.652 --> 14:02.985
They closed East Dillon for a reason.
The place was a cesspool.

14:03.689 --> 14:06.317
I assure you, East Dillon
will be brought up to code

14:06.392 --> 14:08.622
before a single student
walks through the door.

14:08.694 --> 14:09.956
What's this mean for the team?

14:10.029 --> 14:11.326
Bailey, hell if I know.

14:11.397 --> 14:13.024
Are we gonna be
the Panthers anymore?

14:13.099 --> 14:14.930
Oh, yes, Barbara,
the PTA President.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.729
Thank you,
Superintendent Dunley.

14:16.802 --> 14:20.500
Ladies and gentlemen, we're faced
with some really important decisions.

14:20.607 --> 14:23.075
Principal Taylor, we really respect
you and value your opinion.

14:23.143 --> 14:24.235
What do you think?

14:24.311 --> 14:26.074
Is this a good idea?

14:26.646 --> 14:28.273
Well...

14:28.849 --> 14:30.714
I mean, listen,
y'all, you know...

14:30.784 --> 14:35.847
Redistricting is...
Is a complicated issue, and...

14:36.022 --> 14:39.583
Let's face it, we've got a school
that's in dire circumstances right now.

14:39.659 --> 14:41.092
I mean,
we've got real, real problems,

14:41.161 --> 14:43.186
and I think
everybody's aware of that.

14:43.263 --> 14:45.527
The way I read these
documents, it sounds to me

14:45.599 --> 14:48.864
that the only way we're gonna
get any funding from the state

14:48.935 --> 14:51.495
is if we consider
this redistricting.

14:51.905 --> 14:54.772
There you go.
Thank you, Principal Taylor.

14:55.942 --> 14:58.877
You realize half my team
lives east of Collier Avenue?

14:58.945 --> 15:00.207
Mmm-hmm.

15:00.547 --> 15:02.515
This thing goes through,

15:02.749 --> 15:06.048
they're gonna end up playing
for the East Dillon Giraffes

15:06.119 --> 15:08.519
or whatever the hell
they're gonna call themselves.

15:08.588 --> 15:09.850
I know.

15:29.309 --> 15:30.298
Dad?

15:31.111 --> 15:32.100
Dad?

15:57.637 --> 15:58.626
Hi.

16:01.641 --> 16:03.700
I'm happy to see you here.

16:04.044 --> 16:05.272
Can we talk?

16:05.345 --> 16:06.403
Sure.

16:07.113 --> 16:10.981
You can start by congratulating me.
I got into Vanderbilt.

16:12.352 --> 16:14.149
Congratulations, baby.

16:14.221 --> 16:16.348
Not that I'll be able to go.

16:17.891 --> 16:19.449
Baby.
Don't.

16:19.793 --> 16:21.385
Lyla, please.

16:33.106 --> 16:34.698
Hi.
Hey.

16:35.675 --> 16:38.166
Hey, did you know that your dad
called my parents last night?

16:38.778 --> 16:39.802
What?
Yeah.

16:39.880 --> 16:43.714
He called them and said that I
was a negative influence on you.

16:44.584 --> 16:46.449
Do you think
I'm a negative influence?

16:46.519 --> 16:47.645
No, you're amazing.

16:47.721 --> 16:48.915
Good.

16:49.456 --> 16:50.821
What did your parents do?

16:50.891 --> 16:52.153
My mom started crying,

16:52.225 --> 16:54.990
and then my dad got on the phone
and started yelling at your dad,

16:55.062 --> 16:58.156
if he ever said anything like that
about me again, then he'd have to sue.

16:58.266 --> 17:00.166
It was kind of funny.
Damn it!

17:00.234 --> 17:03.397
Well, don't worry.
I'm not in trouble or anything.

17:03.671 --> 17:04.694
You're not mad at me?

17:04.771 --> 17:06.171
No, I mean...

17:06.240 --> 17:07.798
I'm amazing, right?

17:07.875 --> 17:09.637
No, yeah, you're amazing.

17:09.710 --> 17:11.405
Good.
Really amazing.

17:11.479 --> 17:12.810
Good.

17:14.147 --> 17:16.480
Tyra, do you
want to remind me again

17:16.584 --> 17:21.886
why Mindy thinks that it's a good idea
to have a party outside in December?

17:21.989 --> 17:25.982
Yeah, remind me again why my sister thinks
it's a good idea to marry Billy Riggins?

17:26.060 --> 17:27.185
That is a good point.

17:27.261 --> 17:28.922
That's a really good point.

17:28.996 --> 17:31.726
Speak of the devil.
It's Lady Di herself.

17:32.533 --> 17:34.057
Hey, what's up?

17:34.669 --> 17:37.797
Well, no, I haven't heard
back from everybody yet.

17:38.506 --> 17:41.873
Well, we're here, but I don't
know if I can change it.

17:42.143 --> 17:43.508
No, what are you trying to say?

17:43.577 --> 17:45.670
Okay, let me see.
This is ridiculous.

17:45.746 --> 17:47.941
No, I...
Let me see. I got it.

17:48.015 --> 17:49.505
Excuse me, Mindy.

17:49.784 --> 17:51.149
Hey, this is Landry.

17:52.453 --> 17:53.750
Landry Clarke.

17:54.789 --> 17:58.384
Yes, you do. You know exactly who I am.
That's not funny. Stop laughing.

17:58.459 --> 18:02.225
Okay, Mindy, listen. Me and Tyra
have this whole thing under control.

18:02.296 --> 18:03.729
We've got the chairs,
we've got the tables.

18:03.798 --> 18:05.789
There's no need for you
to keep calling.

18:05.866 --> 18:08.391
Okay? We've got it.
All right? Bye-bye.

18:09.236 --> 18:10.225
Nice.

18:13.841 --> 18:16.674
You got anybody east of Boyd's Lane?
Anybody east of, what's this, Driscoll?

18:16.777 --> 18:17.835
He's got a brother.

18:17.912 --> 18:19.846
They can have these
middle areas in here.

18:20.081 --> 18:22.106
We need to find out who's on this
other side of Michigan Avenue.

18:22.183 --> 18:24.981
And this here is...
How 'bout this cross street here?

18:25.052 --> 18:28.078
We got anybody going up McAlister?
They move, we just take more.

18:28.155 --> 18:30.715
Hey, Lester, listen,
you're not thinking ahead.

18:30.791 --> 18:33.624
The Snyder boys are gonna be
freshmen in two years.

18:33.694 --> 18:35.855
They're already as big as houses,
they got to be Panthers.

18:35.963 --> 18:37.624
Yeah, I got it.
That's a good idea.

18:37.698 --> 18:40.724
Hey, Joe, don't we still
wanna keep Charles White?

18:40.801 --> 18:43.201
All right, so we're gonna have
to bring this line over here.

18:43.270 --> 18:45.795
Somehow we can compromise...
Hey, what's going on?

18:45.873 --> 18:47.636
Hey, you made it.
What's going on?

18:47.708 --> 18:51.109
Well, this redistricting vote came up
before we could do anything about it,

18:51.178 --> 18:55.774
but don't worry, there's nothing we can't fix.
We're working on it right now.

18:55.850 --> 18:57.374
I thought the line was
Collier Avenue.

18:57.451 --> 19:00.181
Well, the line is Collier
Avenue, but don't worry,

19:00.254 --> 19:05.123
the boosters and Paul Dunley, the
superintendent, everybody's on the same page,

19:05.192 --> 19:07.717
and the bottom line is, we're
all about the Dillon Panthers.

19:07.795 --> 19:10.195
We're gonna make sure that the
Dillon Panthers stay intact.

19:10.264 --> 19:12.164
Here's that beer you ordered, Buddy.
Okay, thank you.

19:12.233 --> 19:14.098
Darla, if I were you,
I'd run his credit card,

19:14.168 --> 19:16.466
'cause, you know, I hear
his last tab was a doozy.

19:17.738 --> 19:20.138
Hey, hey, hey. That's real funny, Joe.
I will say this,

19:20.207 --> 19:22.471
that's the most expensive
lap dance I've ever had.

19:24.111 --> 19:26.807
All right.
How about Hall? Jimmy Hall?

19:26.881 --> 19:28.007
He was another defensive end.

19:28.082 --> 19:30.243
I think that he moved out of that area, too.
Through here.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.047
Matthew?
Yes.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.746
Where are my slippers, honey?

19:35.824 --> 19:37.086
What?

19:37.826 --> 19:40.056
Where are my slippers, honey?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.489
They're right there
on your feet, Grandma.

19:43.565 --> 19:45.465
I need my slippers, Matthew.

19:46.701 --> 19:49.135
I need my slippers, honey.
I need them now.

19:49.638 --> 19:51.037
Grandma, they're on your feet.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.097
Where are my slippers?
Oh, hey.

19:53.175 --> 19:54.574
Huh?
Whoa.

19:54.676 --> 19:56.507
Where are they?
Grandma, they're right there.

19:56.578 --> 19:57.602
Matthew!

19:57.679 --> 20:00.978
All right, well, I...
Grandma, just sit down, okay?

20:01.483 --> 20:03.474
Do you need another
pair of slippers, or...

20:03.552 --> 20:06.715
I need my slippers!
Help me!

20:07.823 --> 20:10.314
Here. Look, here.
Grandma, here, here.

20:11.193 --> 20:12.626
Is that good?

20:16.398 --> 20:17.888
That what you need?

20:20.802 --> 20:22.133
Thank you.

20:23.205 --> 20:24.536
Thank you.

20:25.273 --> 20:26.604
Thank you.

20:28.276 --> 20:30.267
Don't mean to step
on your toes or anything,

20:30.345 --> 20:33.246
but you might wanna try cutting
those a little bit thinner,

20:33.315 --> 20:36.648
just 'cause cucumber sandwiches
are kind of delicate.

20:36.952 --> 20:38.044
Really?

20:38.120 --> 20:40.384
Did I just lose a lot
of man points for that?

20:40.455 --> 20:43.618
I'm trying not to keep count,
but, yeah. Yeah, you did.

20:43.692 --> 20:45.853
Did I tell you
that I'm in a band, though?

20:45.927 --> 20:49.419
See, there's like 40,000 man points, see.
So you're in the black.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.861
Did I tell you I got my
SAT scores back?

20:52.934 --> 20:55.494
No. Are you gonna
let me see them?

21:02.911 --> 21:04.208
Well, you went up.

21:04.379 --> 21:05.403
Yeah.

21:05.480 --> 21:08.040
You went up like 100 points.
That's awesome!

21:08.116 --> 21:10.550
Yeah.
I needed to go up like 200

21:11.019 --> 21:13.954
to make up for freshman
and sophomore year...

21:14.723 --> 21:17.715
It's fine.
Well, this is still really good.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.291
Can I say something?

21:21.963 --> 21:24.295
Most girls that
look like you do,

21:24.699 --> 21:26.496
things are easy,
they can just coast by

21:26.568 --> 21:29.833
on their good looks for the rest of
their lives and not really have to...

21:29.905 --> 21:32.738
Not really have to worry.
I mean, I know it sounds stupid,

21:32.807 --> 21:36.607
but I'm proud of how hard you've
been working for this. It...

21:37.078 --> 21:38.375
I mean, it says something.

21:38.446 --> 21:42.405
I think good things are gonna
happen, you just gotta keep going.

21:43.118 --> 21:44.449
Thank you.

21:47.522 --> 21:50.218
You still think I'm
good-looking, though, right?

21:50.292 --> 21:51.987
You're still...
You've still got...

21:52.060 --> 21:53.322
You know, yeah.

21:54.529 --> 21:56.463
I think you're still okay.

21:56.531 --> 21:58.021
"Okay"? Thanks.

21:59.201 --> 22:01.761
Hey, you see that
truck right there?

22:02.204 --> 22:06.641
It's been on the lot 18 months
and it just won't move.

22:07.076 --> 22:08.543
I challenge myself. I've said,

22:08.611 --> 22:12.274
"By God, today, Buddy Garrity,
you're gonna sell this truck.' '"

22:12.348 --> 22:13.372
And here she sits!

22:13.449 --> 22:17.613
I don't like what's going on between
the boosters and this remapping.

22:18.854 --> 22:21.414
Well, that's not something
you need to worry about.

22:21.490 --> 22:23.549
We've got that taken care of.
We'll take care of it for you.

22:23.626 --> 22:26.220
I don't want anyone taking
care of anything for me.

22:26.295 --> 22:29.958
Let me tell you something, this
is a whole lot bigger than you.

22:30.032 --> 22:32.432
This is about
the Dillon Panthers.

22:32.501 --> 22:37.564
No one, not me, not Joe McCoy,
not any other booster

22:37.940 --> 22:42.104
is gonna stand by and let the
Dillon Panthers get dismantled

22:42.178 --> 22:45.477
because of some dang politics,
I'll tell you that right now.

22:45.548 --> 22:47.641
So if you don't wanna know,

22:48.651 --> 22:49.982
don't ask.

23:04.433 --> 23:06.298
I'll see you tomorrow.

23:07.870 --> 23:09.235
Good night.

23:10.406 --> 23:11.771
Good night.

23:12.475 --> 23:13.772
What are we doing here, Tim?

23:13.843 --> 23:15.936
I know you were
gonna ask that, so...

23:16.012 --> 23:18.981
I know this is the first church that you
started going to with your whole family,

23:19.048 --> 23:20.777
so I just wanted to,
you know, come...

23:20.850 --> 23:24.752
Just come sit down with me for one sec.
Please, please, please.

23:25.354 --> 23:29.450
With the angelic host proclaim

23:29.992 --> 23:34.122
Christ is born in Bethlehem

23:34.497 --> 23:38.831
Hark! The herald angels sing

23:39.335 --> 23:41.860
Did my dad tell you
to bring me here?

23:42.605 --> 23:45.802
No. No, your dad didn't tell
me to bring you here.

23:46.642 --> 23:48.132
Of course not.

23:49.645 --> 23:50.771
Are you mad?

23:50.846 --> 23:53.838
I just don't understand
what we're doing here.

23:54.850 --> 23:57.580
Light and life to all He brings

23:57.653 --> 23:59.621
I thought it might
just cheer you up.

23:59.689 --> 24:02.089
Maybe I don't
wanna be cheered up.

24:05.528 --> 24:06.756
Well, I didn't
bring you here...

24:06.829 --> 24:08.490
Just leave me alone, please!

24:08.564 --> 24:10.293
Garrity...
Damn it!

24:11.634 --> 24:13.693
Garrity. Hey. Hey.

24:14.537 --> 24:17.097
Come here! Look,
Lyla, stop. Please.

24:17.173 --> 24:19.698
No! I don't even know what I'm doing here!
Please stop.

24:19.775 --> 24:22.005
Why did I stay here?

24:22.078 --> 24:23.978
Why did I let them go?

24:24.480 --> 24:26.414
You didn't let 'em go.

24:26.849 --> 24:28.646
What was I thinking?

24:28.884 --> 24:30.943
Why didn't I go with them?

24:32.988 --> 24:34.649
I have no family.

24:36.192 --> 24:37.887
I have no family.

24:39.295 --> 24:41.786
Yeah, you do, come here.
Come here.

24:45.202 --> 24:46.692
It's all right.

24:56.413 --> 24:59.280
Okay, there's no way
that these are their real names.

24:59.349 --> 25:02.216
I better get, like, a billion
sister points for this thing.

25:02.285 --> 25:04.276
Okay, what else
do we need to do?

25:04.721 --> 25:06.211
Scones.
Okay.

25:15.098 --> 25:16.326
You gotta be kidding me!

25:16.400 --> 25:17.492
Take it inside!

25:28.278 --> 25:29.267
Mama,
you all set over there?

25:29.346 --> 25:31.814
Yes. Perfect. Beautiful.
Okay. All right.

25:33.817 --> 25:35.910
Everything looks good, huh?

25:36.720 --> 25:39.814
Oh, they're here! Come in, sweetie, come in!
Come in, come in.

25:39.890 --> 25:43.189
Okay, Tyra, I really have to go.
I should have left, like, 20 minutes ago.

25:43.260 --> 25:44.784
Yeah, I wonder why you didn't.

25:44.861 --> 25:47.352
Okay, you got everything
you need? Got a camera?

25:47.431 --> 25:48.728
All right.

25:51.501 --> 25:53.492
Thank you, for everything.

25:53.837 --> 25:55.395
You're welcome.

25:56.339 --> 25:57.738
You're very sweet.

25:57.808 --> 25:59.173
Well, I try.

26:04.381 --> 26:06.679
Your favorite color
and everything.

26:06.750 --> 26:08.945
How nice, thank you, yes.

26:09.019 --> 26:11.180
And it goes with this.
Of course!

26:12.289 --> 26:13.916
Up goes the heat.

26:14.791 --> 26:16.053
Shut up!

26:17.994 --> 26:19.325
Honey, I know you and
Billy are forever,

26:19.396 --> 26:20.886
but this is gonna
help you keep things fresh.

26:20.964 --> 26:24.058
Is it? That's good to know!
It's all I'm saying.

26:25.669 --> 26:28.035
Okay, I need to
make a toast, guys.

26:28.104 --> 26:31.005
Thank you so much for
coming to my bridal shower.

26:31.074 --> 26:34.237
You guys are the best friends
any girl could ever have.

26:34.311 --> 26:38.213
And I really need to
thank my baby sister Tyra.

26:38.782 --> 26:42.149
'Cause she put this whole day
together, and it's really perfect.

26:42.219 --> 26:46.280
And even though she's the baby of
the family and my younger sister,

26:46.356 --> 26:47.983
I look up to her.

26:49.392 --> 26:50.825
I love you, Ty-Ty!

26:50.894 --> 26:52.020
I love you.

26:53.697 --> 26:56.825
And maybe one day,
if you're really lucky,

26:56.900 --> 27:00.734
you will find a man almost
as hot as Billy Riggins!

27:20.791 --> 27:23.851
Now, listen to me.
Are you listening to me?

27:23.928 --> 27:26.021
Joe, how can he not be listening?
He's sitting right there.

27:26.097 --> 27:27.997
Honey, he knows exactly
what I'm talking about, okay?

27:28.065 --> 27:29.794
Hey, what is with the attitude?

27:29.867 --> 27:31.334
What attitude?
I didn't say anything.

27:31.402 --> 27:35.668
Okay, listen to me. In the rain, the
name of the game is ball control, okay?

27:35.740 --> 27:37.435
Your first read is
always your short routes,

27:37.508 --> 27:39.066
your safe ones, okay?
Yep.

27:39.143 --> 27:41.976
On the run-pass option, you
pull it down and you keep it,

27:42.046 --> 27:43.274
unless it's a gimme.

27:43.347 --> 27:46.043
You are running the football
tonight, do you understand?

27:46.117 --> 27:47.482
I got it.
Are you sure?

27:47.552 --> 27:48.814
Yeah, I'm positive.

27:48.886 --> 27:53.084
Honey, we get it. When it rains, things
get a little slippery, like the football!

27:53.157 --> 27:56.957
Yeah, hear what your mom says?
The ball gets slippery. Now, listen to me.

27:57.028 --> 27:59.826
What I'm talking about is ball
control. Now, you do that,

27:59.897 --> 28:02.730
you win this game, and we are
headed to State, baby.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.098
All right, I gotta go.
Go get 'em.

28:05.169 --> 28:07.467
See you, honey.
Run the ball.

28:08.205 --> 28:09.536
All right.

28:11.876 --> 28:13.810
The gateway
to the State Championship

28:13.878 --> 28:16.403
is through a real
Texas toad strangler, folks.

28:16.480 --> 28:20.143
It's wet, it's windy,
it's semifinal football.

28:20.618 --> 28:21.710
Listen up!

28:21.786 --> 28:24.550
This is it, fellas, here's what
we've been working for, right here.

28:24.622 --> 28:27.056
It's a beautiful night
for football, gentlemen.

28:28.192 --> 28:31.992
Let's go out there and punch 'em
right in the mouth. What do you say?

28:32.063 --> 28:34.861
Let's go! Clear eyes,
full hearts...

28:34.932 --> 28:36.263
Can't lose!

28:37.768 --> 28:42.034
Early in the second quarter
and it is really coming down, folks.

28:42.106 --> 28:44.904
Mustangs have the ball.
There's the pitch left.

28:44.976 --> 28:46.773
He's got an opening!

28:47.511 --> 28:49.035
Big hit! And a fumble!

28:50.214 --> 28:52.307
There you go, baby!
There you go, baby!

28:52.383 --> 28:53.611
Panthers have the ball!

28:53.684 --> 28:54.912
Way to go, baby!

28:56.387 --> 28:57.547
Let's go, let's go!

28:57.622 --> 28:59.249
Come on now, J. D!

28:59.323 --> 29:01.951
Blue, 80. Set! Hut!

29:03.194 --> 29:05.685
McCoy drops back to pass.

29:05.763 --> 29:07.287
He lets it fly!

29:07.632 --> 29:10.294
Saracen has got it
inside the 10!

29:10.368 --> 29:12.393
What a fantastic catch!

29:14.405 --> 29:16.270
He got lucky.
Yay!

29:16.340 --> 29:17.932
He got lucky on that one.

29:20.144 --> 29:23.204
McCoy, draw to Tim Riggins,
he's got a lane!

29:24.015 --> 29:26.984
Big Tim Riggins
powers into the end zone!

29:27.051 --> 29:28.712
Touchdown, Panthers!

29:33.224 --> 29:35.192
Let's go, J.D. let's go, baby!

29:35.259 --> 29:36.988
Run it right down their throat!

29:37.528 --> 29:38.790
McCoy rolls left.

29:38.863 --> 29:40.091
What is he doing?

29:40.164 --> 29:43.691
He's looking deep,
he fires a big, long ball...

29:43.768 --> 29:47.534
Oh, and it is picked off,
intercepted by Cambria!

29:47.872 --> 29:51.137
He's got blockers out front,
folks, he could score.

29:51.208 --> 29:53.472
Oh, my, it's 6!

29:53.544 --> 29:57.845
Cambria touchdown,
13-7 West Cambria.

29:57.916 --> 29:59.440
You don't
throw in this mess!

29:59.518 --> 30:02.453
Keep it on the ground!
Take the running lane!

30:02.721 --> 30:04.382
Keep it on the ground!

30:04.456 --> 30:05.889
What are you doing?

30:06.725 --> 30:09.125
Use your head, run the ball!

30:11.096 --> 30:12.859
J. D! Come here.

30:15.400 --> 30:18.699
Listen to me. We're gonna stick
to the same game plan, all right?

30:18.770 --> 30:21.637
We're down by 7.
The game hasn't even started yet.

30:21.707 --> 30:23.140
You got it?
Yes, sir. I got it.

30:23.208 --> 30:26.234
Protect the ball, keep your head
up, and have some fun out there.

30:26.311 --> 30:29.610
It's a beautiful night, son.
You're doing fine, let's go, come on.

30:29.681 --> 30:32.309
Let's go, 1-2,
you're on, you're on.

30:32.617 --> 30:34.847
He is not doing what he's
supposed to be doing.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.912
He's gotta do what the coach
tells him to do.

30:39.357 --> 30:42.258
Let's go, offense, let's go!
Watch the left!

30:42.694 --> 30:44.093
I can't believe it, folks,

30:44.162 --> 30:47.222
but McCoy is looking deep
and he lets it fly...

30:47.299 --> 30:50.666
And that is out in the middle
of no man's land.

30:52.337 --> 30:55.238
Come on, come on, J. D!
Let's go, son!

30:55.307 --> 30:56.569
Run it!

30:56.641 --> 30:58.632
He takes the snap,
opens left...

30:58.710 --> 31:01.941
Oh! Fumble,
and the ball is on the carpet!

31:02.280 --> 31:04.009
Cambria has got it!

31:04.082 --> 31:07.245
J.D. McCoy fumbles,
and West Cambria recovers.

31:07.319 --> 31:08.786
What are you doing?

31:09.755 --> 31:13.282
You can't throw, you can't
even pitch! Pull his ass out!

31:13.525 --> 31:16.460
Come on, Coach, pull him out
before he ends the season!

31:16.528 --> 31:18.359
It's been a real heart-stopper
out there, folks.

31:18.430 --> 31:21.365
A lot of miscues
on both sides of the ball.

31:21.433 --> 31:23.264
West Cambria lines up
for the punt.

31:23.335 --> 31:26.031
The snap is on the ground,
Riggins comes up!

31:26.304 --> 31:28.033
And he just takes him out!

31:28.106 --> 31:31.075
The ball's on the ground,
Panthers pick it up.

31:31.143 --> 31:32.906
He is gonna score, folks!

31:32.978 --> 31:36.379
Oh, my!
Touchdown, Dillon Panthers!

31:36.681 --> 31:39.582
And the Dillon Panthers
are down by 1.

31:39.651 --> 31:43.849
It is 13-14, with seconds
left to go in this contest.

31:43.922 --> 31:45.184
We're going for 2.

31:45.257 --> 31:48.249
And it appears
Coach Taylor is going for 2!

31:48.727 --> 31:51.958
He's going for the win,
he does not want the tie.

31:53.965 --> 31:55.865
Wait. Go for the tie!

31:55.934 --> 31:59.199
This is for State, folks.
And here we go!

31:59.271 --> 32:00.829
Three, 85!

32:01.373 --> 32:02.465
Set, hut!

32:02.874 --> 32:04.466
McCoy drops back.

32:04.643 --> 32:05.940
Oh, he's in trouble right away,

32:06.011 --> 32:07.876
and he has got to scramble!

32:07.946 --> 32:10.210
He cuts back to the right
and, oh, he...

32:10.282 --> 32:12.375
No! He's still on his feet!

32:12.517 --> 32:14.075
Would you run the ball?

32:14.252 --> 32:15.981
He looks downfield.

32:16.054 --> 32:18.181
He fires it in the end zone!

32:20.525 --> 32:24.256
Caught by Tim Riggins
in the end zone, 2 points!

32:24.329 --> 32:28.493
And the Panthers of Dillon,
Texas are going to State!

32:36.309 --> 32:37.674
Come here!

32:39.879 --> 32:41.141
Good job.

32:55.394 --> 32:57.123
That was some game!

33:00.433 --> 33:01.627
Look...

33:04.103 --> 33:05.263
I'm sorry.

33:05.338 --> 33:06.703
No, that's okay.

33:06.772 --> 33:08.763
No, look, you were right.

33:10.142 --> 33:13.043
I don't know how to take
care of Grandma anymore.

33:13.112 --> 33:15.580
Okay, well,
we can figure that out.

33:17.650 --> 33:20.016
I don't really
want you to leave.

33:22.021 --> 33:24.216
I was never going anywhere.

33:27.693 --> 33:28.990
Thanks.

33:30.963 --> 33:33.523
Come on, let me give you a ride home.

33:36.469 --> 33:37.458
Good job
out there, Coach.

33:37.536 --> 33:39.231
Those guys are
playing really good.

33:39.305 --> 33:41.637
Hey, thanks very much.
Thanks, guys. Great game.

33:41.707 --> 33:43.299
Thanks.
Hi.

33:43.376 --> 33:45.003
Come on, this way.
Hey, y'all.

33:45.077 --> 33:46.601
Take care, guys.
Okay.

33:46.679 --> 33:49.273
Well, yeah, I know,
it was cold.

33:49.715 --> 33:51.376
I know, it was crazy.

33:51.450 --> 33:54.248
No, it was good out there,
it was a lot of fun.

33:54.320 --> 33:57.221
It's like playing on a
slippery slide or something.

33:57.290 --> 34:00.657
What? You'd better stop.
You're gonna get it, all right?

34:00.726 --> 34:02.887
Hang up the phone.
Yeah. What?

34:03.596 --> 34:05.621
I said hang up the phone.

34:06.332 --> 34:08.027
Why?
Hang up the phone!

34:08.100 --> 34:09.897
Joe, relax!

34:09.969 --> 34:12.199
Hey, can I call you back later?

34:12.737 --> 34:13.762
Yeah.

34:19.178 --> 34:21.476
Hey, listen.
I'm hearing that...

34:21.914 --> 34:23.779
This whole redistricting thing?

34:24.183 --> 34:26.447
They're completely
changing the map.

34:26.518 --> 34:28.146
You know how it was
that straight line?

34:28.219 --> 34:30.279
Now they're kind of zigzagging
all over the place.

34:30.356 --> 34:32.620
Did you hear
anything about that?

34:33.059 --> 34:34.083
Uh-uh.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.717
It's the craziest thing.

34:36.395 --> 34:37.487
They're just talking about...

34:37.563 --> 34:40.123
It's sounding like a
jigsaw puzzle or something,

34:40.199 --> 34:41.688
and I think
it's all about football.

34:41.766 --> 34:43.632
Can they even do that?

34:45.404 --> 34:46.871
I don't know.

34:46.973 --> 34:49.703
Well, I don't know, either.
Guess we'll find out.

34:49.775 --> 34:53.710
Ain't it weird to think that East
Dillon would be our main rival

34:53.779 --> 34:55.542
if this all happens?

34:58.351 --> 35:00.148
Big Texas storm!

35:00.319 --> 35:02.219
You did a great job, honey,
I'm proud of you.

35:02.288 --> 35:04.051
Thanks.
You're gonna have fun, right?

35:04.123 --> 35:06.387
J.D. hold up a sec,
I wanna talk to you, Son.

35:06.459 --> 35:07.586
Sweetie, just give us
a second here.

35:07.661 --> 35:08.719
Why?

35:08.795 --> 35:12.424
Why? That was a pathetic display
you put on this evening.

35:12.499 --> 35:15.297
Pathetic display?
I got us to State, didn't I?

35:15.369 --> 35:18.361
Boy, you got lucky, okay?
We talked about strategy,

35:18.438 --> 35:22.465
we talked about running the football tonight.
And what are you doing?

35:22.542 --> 35:24.169
Pass, interception, pass!

35:24.244 --> 35:26.212
Joe. Joe! Let's go. Calm down.
Honey, stop it. Stop it.

35:26.279 --> 35:28.543
Like you never played
in a game in your life!

35:28.615 --> 35:30.947
Why don't you go call Madison's parents?
Talk to them about it?

35:31.018 --> 35:34.044
Boy, I will call them every day
of the week until that tramp

35:34.121 --> 35:37.284
stops coming around our house.
You understand me, boy?

35:37.357 --> 35:38.483
You know what?

35:38.558 --> 35:40.719
I don't care what you do, Dad.
All right? Screw you!

35:40.794 --> 35:42.694
Wait. You don't talk
to me like that!

35:42.763 --> 35:44.492
Hey, honey? Look.

35:45.265 --> 35:46.493
Is that...

35:47.401 --> 35:48.891
Oh, Lord.

35:49.036 --> 35:52.096
Stay here.
No! No, I'm coming with you.

35:52.172 --> 35:54.663
You don't
talk to me like that! Damn it.

35:54.741 --> 35:57.801
Stop it, Joe!
Boy, you don't talk to me that way!

35:57.878 --> 35:59.038
Stop it!

35:59.112 --> 36:01.580
Stop!
You will respect me!

36:01.648 --> 36:05.311
You will not talk to me
that way, ever!

36:05.986 --> 36:07.078
Ever!

36:07.954 --> 36:10.081
Y'all okay?
You all right?

36:10.624 --> 36:12.990
Did he hurt you?
Are you okay?

36:13.627 --> 36:16.994
Come here, let's go inside.
Come on, let's go inside.

36:26.273 --> 36:28.867
You know what that was?
That was a game for the ages.

36:28.942 --> 36:30.204
What a game!

36:30.877 --> 36:32.572
Why don't you go out?

36:32.646 --> 36:35.547
You guys are going to State.
There's probably

36:35.615 --> 36:37.606
tons of parties tonight.

36:37.918 --> 36:42.150
'Cause the real parties
are when we win State.

36:42.456 --> 36:44.151
That's when
the real parties are.

36:44.224 --> 36:46.749
And then there's
one little thing, too.

36:46.827 --> 36:48.419
I think I'm okay

36:50.597 --> 36:52.155
hanging with my gal.

36:52.766 --> 36:55.496
Especially after a night
like tonight.

36:59.272 --> 37:02.002
You're not having
much fun here, are you?

37:03.877 --> 37:04.935
Yeah.

37:06.146 --> 37:07.135
Why?

37:07.214 --> 37:08.545
Well, maybe I'm just
stating the obvious,

37:08.615 --> 37:11.914
but it just seems you been
pretty down around here.

37:12.385 --> 37:14.683
I mean, what...

37:14.754 --> 37:18.451
What did I expect?
To just move in here, and you're gonna

37:18.758 --> 37:20.385
solve all my problems?

37:20.460 --> 37:24.726
Okay, you know what? I'm not here to solve
all your problems, Garrity. I'm not.

37:24.798 --> 37:27.699
I'm here to support you no matter what
choice you make. That's why I'm here.

37:27.767 --> 37:30.099
I'm your boyfriend, I think
I'm a pretty darn good one.

37:30.170 --> 37:32.365
You know what? Your dad
threw you a good curve ball.

37:32.439 --> 37:34.930
But this self-pity
that I've been seeing,

37:35.008 --> 37:36.566
it's gotta stop.

37:37.277 --> 37:39.905
You're better than that. Okay?

37:41.414 --> 37:45.181
And you can still get into any college you want.
Any one you want, still.

37:45.253 --> 37:47.221
How am I gonna afford it?
If you can't afford it,

37:47.288 --> 37:48.550
there's scholarships to be had.

37:48.623 --> 37:51.057
I mean, your grades
speak for themselves.

37:51.125 --> 37:53.184
And you know what?
If it doesn't,

37:53.628 --> 37:57.155
there's San Antonio State,
and I would love to have you.

38:00.601 --> 38:02.728
Did I just say I loved you?

38:02.803 --> 38:04.168
Did I? No?

38:05.306 --> 38:07.638
'Cause I'm kind of madly
in love with you,

38:07.708 --> 38:10.074
and I'll be here
no matter what.

38:11.712 --> 38:13.339
I love you, too.

38:17.018 --> 38:18.349
He pushed.

38:18.886 --> 38:20.751
He pushed him so hard.

38:25.860 --> 38:27.191
I should have stopped it.

38:27.261 --> 38:28.751
Honey, honey, honey...

38:28.829 --> 38:31.855
Listen, don't you go
blaming yourself, all right?

38:31.933 --> 38:34.265
It's not your fault.
Don't even go down that road.

38:34.335 --> 38:36.200
He hit him.
I know.

38:39.974 --> 38:41.601
He hit my baby.

38:46.380 --> 38:48.109
What am I gonna do?

38:48.382 --> 38:51.749
You know what?
You're not gonna do anything right now.

38:54.088 --> 38:57.057
You're just gonna
drink your tea.

38:58.292 --> 39:00.920
Just leave it be
for right now, okay?

39:01.996 --> 39:03.623
I'm sorry, babe.

39:08.469 --> 39:11.529
Nothing I do
is ever good enough for him.

39:12.673 --> 39:16.336
I mean, it's always this or always that.
I can't take it anymore!

39:16.410 --> 39:18.139
He treats me like
I'm some dumb kid.

39:18.212 --> 39:19.679
I understand.

39:21.449 --> 39:23.576
I don't wanna
see his face again.

39:23.651 --> 39:26.711
I don't wanna go back
to that house, I hate it.

39:26.854 --> 39:29.220
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

39:31.325 --> 39:32.952
Listen, what's gonna happen
tonight, I think, is

39:33.027 --> 39:36.019
you and your mom are gonna
stay here. All right?

39:36.864 --> 39:38.559
You and your mom are gonna
have to talk this thing out,

39:38.633 --> 39:41.124
figure out
what the next step is...

39:42.303 --> 39:46.000
The important thing to know is that
you're not alone in this, all right?

39:46.073 --> 39:47.768
I mean, is it, like,
my fault or something?

39:47.842 --> 39:49.639
Listen, what he did was wrong.
Did I do something wrong?

39:49.710 --> 39:51.701
There's no two ways about it,
that's just wrong.

39:51.779 --> 39:54.077
Whether it's your father
or not.

39:55.216 --> 39:56.308
Hey,

39:57.351 --> 39:59.819
this will work out
in the long run.

40:09.363 --> 40:12.526
I need a second opinion. No.
Does this make me look fat? I need to know.

40:12.600 --> 40:13.931
You are sexy!

40:14.001 --> 40:16.902
Thank you. See, she says I'm sexy,
so I don't know what to tell you.

40:16.971 --> 40:18.404
I'm taking these,

40:18.472 --> 40:20.873
those are hot, and this.
Let's go.

40:20.942 --> 40:22.466
Come on, baby.
Bye, you two.

40:22.544 --> 40:23.772
We'll see you kids later.
Bye.

40:23.845 --> 40:25.540
Thank you!
I love you two.

40:25.614 --> 40:26.638
Bye, sweetheart.

40:26.715 --> 40:27.943
I love you!

40:28.016 --> 40:30.211
I love y'all, take care.
Bye.

40:30.285 --> 40:32.412
Oh, my God, this place...

40:32.487 --> 40:35.581
Somebody just put their gum
right on the table.

40:36.925 --> 40:38.790
Honey, what's the matter?

40:38.860 --> 40:41.021
I don't know what's
wrong with me anymore.

40:41.096 --> 40:44.497
Nothing's wrong with you.
What are you talking about?

40:46.134 --> 40:47.999
Why can't I want that?

40:50.105 --> 40:52.232
They look so happy.

40:52.974 --> 40:55.204
I mean, I spend all this time

40:55.844 --> 40:59.974
trying to go to college, and it's
seeming more and more impossible.

41:03.051 --> 41:06.316
Honey, listen to me, let me
tell you something, all right?

41:06.388 --> 41:08.948
Okay. I love my Mindy.

41:10.225 --> 41:12.193
You know,
she was my first baby.

41:12.260 --> 41:14.888
And she's so funny and darling,

41:15.764 --> 41:17.425
you know, but...

41:17.733 --> 41:19.064
She has never surprised me,

41:19.134 --> 41:22.194
not one day in her life,
bless her heart.

41:23.638 --> 41:25.003
But you...

41:26.508 --> 41:28.476
You surprise me, honey.

41:30.212 --> 41:33.545
Every day since the minute
I knew you were coming,

41:34.816 --> 41:36.340
till right now.

41:36.585 --> 41:38.883
You are a wonder.

41:39.621 --> 41:42.556
I have no idea
what's gonna happen with you,

41:42.758 --> 41:46.694
not a clue, I've no idea what
college you're gonna go to,

41:46.762 --> 41:48.195
or anything.

41:48.263 --> 41:51.130
But I know one thing,
with all my heart,

41:51.767 --> 41:53.098
that you

41:53.168 --> 41:56.604
are gonna have everything
that you are dreaming of.

41:57.639 --> 42:01.234
You're gonna get everything
you're reaching for, honey.

42:01.309 --> 42:02.537
You are.

42:03.178 --> 42:06.978
And I want you to keep
reaching, you keep going.

42:07.616 --> 42:10.608
One of these days, you're gonna
surprise yourself, you'll see.

42:10.685 --> 42:13.279
I won't be surprised,
but you will be.

42:13.622 --> 42:14.987
I know it.

42:16.224 --> 42:18.954
I love you.
I love you, sweetie, so much.

42:19.628 --> 42:21.220
Thank you, Mama.
