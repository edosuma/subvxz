WEBVTT

00:00.213 --> 00:01.579
My name
is Michael Westen.

00:01.631 --> 00:03.682
I used to be
a spy until...

00:03.749 --> 00:05.466
We got a burn notice on you.

00:05.501 --> 00:07.335
You're blacklisted.

00:07.386 --> 00:09.754
When you're burned,
you've got nothing--

00:09.839 --> 00:12.007
no cash, no credit,
no job history.

00:12.058 --> 00:14.375
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:14.427 --> 00:16.761
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.846 --> 00:19.097
You do whatever work
comes your way.

00:19.181 --> 00:21.266
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you...

00:22.768 --> 00:23.735
A trigger-happy girlfriend...

00:23.819 --> 00:25.186
Should we shoot them?

00:25.237 --> 00:27.188
An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...

00:27.239 --> 00:29.824
You know spies--
bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:29.892 --> 00:31.225
Family too...

00:31.277 --> 00:32.159
Hey, is that your mom again?

00:32.226 --> 00:33.328
If you're desperate...

00:33.395 --> 00:34.675
Someone needs your help,
Michael.

00:34.697 --> 00:37.365
And a down-and-out spy
you met along the way.

00:37.416 --> 00:38.917
That's how we do it,
people.

00:39.001 --> 00:41.670
Bottom line,
as long as you're burned,

00:41.737 --> 00:44.706
you're not going anywhere.

00:45.317 --> 00:46.384
It's a deep-cover job.

00:46.385 --> 00:48.336
We're going after the leader
of a terrorist network.

00:48.420 --> 00:50.671
I need you to bring them down
no matter what.

00:50.756 --> 00:52.590
I'm a man who's willing
to go extremes

00:52.641 --> 00:54.292
to do what I feel is right.

00:54.359 --> 00:55.560
This guy James,
he's getting to you.

00:55.627 --> 00:57.895
They all are.

00:57.963 --> 01:00.515
I'm working with the CIA.

01:00.599 --> 01:03.067
I gave up everything,
even after they burned me,

01:03.135 --> 01:05.203
and I wasted my life.

01:05.269 --> 01:07.939
- You have to turn me in.
- What? No.

01:07.990 --> 01:09.690
Our work will continue.

01:09.775 --> 01:11.692
How will it continue
without a leader?

01:11.777 --> 01:15.029
I see two leaders standing
right before me.

01:15.114 --> 01:16.480
Michael, where are you?

01:16.532 --> 01:18.032
James is coming to Miami.

01:18.117 --> 01:19.617
Get your team ready.

01:19.668 --> 01:23.337
Wait a minute.

01:23.422 --> 01:26.124
- Son of a bitch.
- Mike switched sides.

01:30.179 --> 01:32.997
You stay the hell out
of my way, Sam.

01:35.100 --> 01:36.500
Fi...

01:36.552 --> 01:38.436
I thought you said
she wouldn't be a problem.

01:38.503 --> 01:39.887
I just need
to figure this out.

01:39.972 --> 01:41.105
There's nothing
to figure out, Michael.

01:41.173 --> 01:42.607
James is here.
I'll figure this out.

01:42.674 --> 01:44.308
The CIA is closing in.

01:44.359 --> 01:46.227
We have to finish this now.

01:46.311 --> 01:48.345
If you won't do it,
I will.

01:52.551 --> 01:55.486
Every spy lives in fear
of losing himself.

01:55.537 --> 01:56.854
The CIA is closing in.

01:56.905 --> 01:58.873
We have to finish this now.

01:58.957 --> 02:00.625
Do what you think
is right.

02:00.692 --> 02:01.993
When you work undercover,

02:02.044 --> 02:04.495
the lines between loyalty
and betrayal

02:04.546 --> 02:07.031
can become so blurred,
so grey,

02:07.082 --> 02:09.000
that after a while
you don't know

02:09.050 --> 02:11.169
what you're fighting for
anymore.

02:11.220 --> 02:13.638
Michael, think of all the good
things we could do together.

02:13.705 --> 02:14.972
You end up caught
in the middle

02:15.040 --> 02:16.641
as your friends become
your enemies

02:16.708 --> 02:18.843
and your enemies become
your friends.

02:18.894 --> 02:21.312
If this is what you want,
the man I love is gone.

02:21.379 --> 02:23.097
If you won't do it, I will.

02:23.182 --> 02:25.266
The man I love is gone.

02:25.350 --> 02:29.053
Until the time comes when
you're forced to make a choice.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:40.082 --> 02:42.366
Aah!

02:45.237 --> 02:49.040
This is James Kendrick
to all operatives.

02:49.091 --> 02:53.410
Forgive me.
I have made an error.

02:53.462 --> 02:55.213
Michael Westen
has betrayed us.

02:55.264 --> 02:58.132
He and Fiona Glenanne are
on the rooftop of the facility.

02:58.217 --> 03:01.302
Your orders
are to eliminate them.

03:01.386 --> 03:02.854
No mercy.

03:02.921 --> 03:05.589
Sir, the CIA team
is approaching.

03:05.641 --> 03:09.026
- Is it safe to land?
- No, sir.

03:09.094 --> 03:11.312
Get us out of here.

03:23.292 --> 03:25.943
We have to go.

03:47.349 --> 03:48.983
You shouldn't have come back
for me.

03:49.067 --> 03:51.269
It's a little late
for that.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.470
I need to get you out
of here, Fiona.

03:53.522 --> 03:55.472
I'll cover you as best I--
No, I'm not running.

03:55.524 --> 03:56.807
Fi, look out there.

03:56.858 --> 03:58.326
They got a Humvee
full of guards coming in.

03:58.410 --> 04:00.311
We can't hold them off.

04:04.649 --> 04:06.584
Michael, those aren't guards
in that Humvee.

04:12.874 --> 04:14.325
Figured we could use
a bigger ride.

04:14.376 --> 04:17.261
Let's get the hell out
of here.

04:17.329 --> 04:20.464
Go.

04:23.499 --> 04:27.499
<font color=#00FF00>Burn Notice 7x13</font>

04:34.577 --> 04:35.911
You're lying
to protect the guy

04:35.995 --> 04:37.316
you're supposed to be
taking down.

04:37.615 --> 04:38.832
If you shut this down,

04:38.917 --> 04:40.718
you lose all hope
of stopping him.

04:40.785 --> 04:42.753
You're not just helping 'em,
you're one of 'em.

04:42.804 --> 04:44.221
So I'm asking you
to trust me.

04:45.423 --> 04:47.457
All right.

04:47.509 --> 04:49.126
I dumped the Humvee
in a lot down the road.

04:49.177 --> 04:50.144
Hopefully it won't be found
until nightfall,

04:50.228 --> 04:51.178
if we're lucky.

04:51.262 --> 04:52.262
I tossed the phones

04:52.313 --> 04:53.147
in a garbage truck
heading north.

04:53.231 --> 04:54.464
If anybody tracks 'em,

04:54.516 --> 04:55.683
they'll be digging
through landfill.

04:55.767 --> 04:57.634
We have some breathing room
for now.

05:02.107 --> 05:05.809
Yeah, Mike, um, we gotta
figure out our next steps here.

05:07.979 --> 05:10.480
You guys should just go.

05:10.532 --> 05:12.616
My mom and Charlie should be
at the rally point.

05:12.667 --> 05:13.834
You need to get them
out of Miami.

05:13.918 --> 05:15.202
Well, what about you?

05:15.286 --> 05:17.788
I'll, uh--
I'll figure something out.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.757
Just go.
Mike...

05:19.824 --> 05:21.341
We're not leaving you here, man.
You crazy?

05:21.426 --> 05:23.510
We got problems--
Problems I caused.

05:23.595 --> 05:25.379
Michael, you lost your way.

05:25.463 --> 05:27.881
I betrayed the mission, Fi,

05:27.966 --> 05:29.099
and I turned on all of you.

05:29.167 --> 05:30.288
Mike, just stop right there.

05:30.334 --> 05:31.552
We didn't risk our necks
saving you

05:31.636 --> 05:32.936
just to leave you behind.

05:33.004 --> 05:34.438
The CIA is gonna want to know
what the hell

05:34.505 --> 05:37.391
went down back there, and we
need your help to sort it out.

05:37.475 --> 05:40.477
Now, you with us?

05:40.528 --> 05:42.679
Mike, are you in?

05:50.872 --> 05:54.241
All right, good.
We should get going.

05:54.325 --> 05:57.628
It's a long-ass walk
into town.

06:05.420 --> 06:07.054
In the field,
there's nothing harder

06:07.138 --> 06:09.873
than when you
let your team down.

06:09.924 --> 06:11.675
Apologies and regrets
do no good.

06:11.726 --> 06:15.429
You all just have to move on and
make the best of the situation.

06:17.715 --> 06:19.549
Hey, you guys have
prepaid cell phones?

06:19.601 --> 06:21.685
- By the window.
- Thank you.

06:25.824 --> 06:27.441
It's crucial to stay focused

06:27.525 --> 06:30.160
to try to keep your mind
off the past.

06:30.228 --> 06:32.362
Michael, anyone coming?

06:32.413 --> 06:35.032
But there are times
when that's just not possible.

06:35.083 --> 06:37.785
- Michael?
- I hesitated...

06:37.869 --> 06:39.736
Back there on the roof.

06:39.788 --> 06:42.923
After all we've
been through together,

06:43.007 --> 06:46.243
I almost didn't pull
that trigger.

06:46.294 --> 06:48.512
But you did.

06:51.266 --> 06:53.684
Why did you come back, Fi?

06:53.751 --> 06:55.686
I didn't deserve it.

06:55.753 --> 06:58.388
I didn't do it
because you deserved it.

06:58.439 --> 07:01.758
There's no way you could have
known you'd make it out alive.

07:01.810 --> 07:06.480
I knew that if I was wrong
about you...

07:06.564 --> 07:11.768
It didn't matter if I got out
of there alive.

07:19.711 --> 07:22.663
Okay, I'm good.

07:22.747 --> 07:24.965
- What the hell's all this?
- Supplies.

07:25.049 --> 07:26.950
Figured we could use
some duct tape, you know?

07:27.001 --> 07:28.218
One for everyone.
Just in case.

07:28.286 --> 07:29.970
And you're getting beer.

07:30.054 --> 07:31.755
You realize
we're on the run, right?

07:31.806 --> 07:35.225
Yes, which means this could be
our last six-pack.

07:35.293 --> 07:37.010
Okay.

07:37.095 --> 07:38.145
Well, in that case,
get something imported,

07:38.229 --> 07:40.764
'cause I'm not drinking
that crap.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.634
Hands where I can see 'em.

07:50.441 --> 07:51.641
What seems
to be the problem here?

07:51.693 --> 07:55.362
Well, you tell me.

07:55.446 --> 07:57.698
You're the guys that the cops
are looking for.

07:57.782 --> 08:01.318
News says
there's a $50,000 reward.

08:01.369 --> 08:03.253
Well, looks like we just hit
the lottery.

08:03.321 --> 08:05.756
Ain't that right, Marcos?

08:14.299 --> 08:16.383
$50,000 each, right?

08:16.467 --> 08:18.001
Hey, fellas, can we talk?

08:18.052 --> 08:19.353
Sure we can work
something out.

08:19.437 --> 08:20.854
I mean, do we look
armed and dangerous to you?

08:20.939 --> 08:23.307
Hey, shut up!

08:23.358 --> 08:26.310
And the news didn't say nothing
that you gotta be alive.

08:26.361 --> 08:28.345
Yeah, I got this here
bald-headed one,

08:28.396 --> 08:30.513
yeah, and the one
with the chin.

08:30.565 --> 08:33.183
What is taking Jesse and Sam
so long?

08:33.234 --> 08:36.019
We got to get out of here.

08:36.070 --> 08:38.071
Look there,
the back of the store.

08:38.155 --> 08:40.690
Oh, God, Michael,
we have to get in there.

08:40.741 --> 08:42.708
All I have in my purse
is some C-4.

08:42.794 --> 08:44.378
Our guns are empty.
We're gonna have to bluff it.

08:44.462 --> 08:46.079
As an operative,
it's your job

08:46.164 --> 08:48.698
to determine how likely
a particular plan

08:48.750 --> 08:51.034
is to succeed,
and if something looks

08:51.085 --> 08:53.303
like a suicide mission,
to call it off.

08:53.371 --> 08:55.705
Yeah...That's the plan.

08:55.757 --> 08:58.141
Let's go in and bluff.
Yeah.

08:58.209 --> 09:00.427
Of course,
that only matters

09:00.511 --> 09:01.929
if you care
if you live or die.

09:02.013 --> 09:05.148
Michael, what are you doing?
Michael!

09:05.216 --> 09:06.934
Michael, open the door!
Michael!

09:20.281 --> 09:21.949
Ooh!

09:29.540 --> 09:31.008
Stay down.
Jesus, Mike.

09:31.075 --> 09:33.961
You all right?

09:34.045 --> 09:36.263
Yeah.

09:36.347 --> 09:37.881
It just grazed me.
Michael!

09:37.932 --> 09:39.633
What the hell?

09:39.717 --> 09:40.968
You could have been killed.

09:41.052 --> 09:44.221
I wasn't.
Let's go.

09:58.653 --> 09:59.694
- Yeah?
- It's me.

10:00.371 --> 10:01.891
I was wondering
if you were gonna call.

10:01.939 --> 10:03.790
Strong, my friends and I

10:03.875 --> 10:05.492
are all over the news.

10:05.576 --> 10:06.994
Yeah, there's good reason
for that.

10:07.078 --> 10:08.328
Because you're the most wanted
people in the state right now,

10:08.413 --> 10:09.496
if not the country.

10:09.580 --> 10:10.998
Well, you have
to call this off.

10:11.082 --> 10:13.083
Don't you dare tell me
what I have to do!

10:13.134 --> 10:14.301
The last I heard from you,

10:14.385 --> 10:16.286
we were supposed to be
capturing Kendrick.

10:16.337 --> 10:18.305
Only when I got there,
do you know what I found?

10:18.389 --> 10:20.623
No target, no Agent.

10:20.675 --> 10:22.292
Just Sonya lying dead
on the helipad.

10:22.343 --> 10:25.479
I assume that was your work?

10:25.563 --> 10:26.930
Yeah, that was me.

10:26.981 --> 10:28.682
I don't know what the hell
happened out there,

10:28.766 --> 10:30.100
but I know this:

10:30.151 --> 10:31.902
You and your friends
have destroyed

10:31.969 --> 10:33.303
this entire operation.

10:33.354 --> 10:34.771
Look, my friends had nothing
to do with that.

10:34.822 --> 10:36.189
Leave them out of this.

10:36.274 --> 10:37.754
I'll come in, I'll--
save your breath,

10:37.808 --> 10:39.809
'cause the CIA is fresh out
of deals for Michael Westen.

10:39.861 --> 10:41.301
You promised them
Kendrick's network,

10:41.329 --> 10:42.662
and they didn't get it.

10:42.747 --> 10:44.247
This operation's over.

10:44.315 --> 10:46.283
My career is over.

10:46.334 --> 10:50.837
And as for you...

10:50.922 --> 10:52.622
If you think it was tough
being burned,

10:52.673 --> 10:55.208
you haven't seen anything yet.

10:59.190 --> 11:01.875
A spy's ability to operate
depends on secrecy.

11:02.460 --> 11:04.861
Your anonymity
is your greatest weapon.

11:04.912 --> 11:06.997
It allows you
to operate anywhere,

11:07.048 --> 11:09.833
to deceive your enemies,
and when it's all over,

11:09.884 --> 11:11.718
to slip back
into the shadows.

11:11.802 --> 11:14.203
We've obtained information
that federal authorities

11:14.255 --> 11:16.006
believe that the suspects
may have been involved

11:16.057 --> 11:17.707
in terrorist activities.

11:17.758 --> 11:19.426
When the world knows
your face,

11:19.510 --> 11:21.394
your options get
a lot more limited.

11:21.479 --> 11:24.848
At that point, all you can
really do is attack.

11:24.899 --> 11:26.433
We go after Kendrick directly.

11:26.517 --> 11:27.817
Mike, come on.
You can't be serious.

11:27.885 --> 11:29.385
You want to go after him now?

11:29.437 --> 11:31.905
The CIA, they're sending
everything they have after us,

11:31.989 --> 11:34.157
but they want James.
They want his network.

11:34.224 --> 11:36.104
I think it's the only card
we have left to play.

11:36.110 --> 11:38.778
Come on, after everything that
just went down, that's suicide.

11:38.863 --> 11:42.532
I have to try,
whatever the consequence.

11:42.583 --> 11:44.567
Sonya mentioned
a satellite expert in Miami.

11:44.618 --> 11:46.459
He was making a communication
center for James.

11:46.504 --> 11:49.456
If I can locate him, I might
have a chance to pull this off.

11:49.540 --> 11:51.875
You guys lay low--
uhuh, brother.

11:51.926 --> 11:53.743
If you think we're all gonna
just hide in a hole somewhere

11:53.794 --> 11:55.244
while you do this,
it's not gonna happen.

11:55.296 --> 11:57.547
- It's my decision.
- Mike, enough! We're in this.

11:57.598 --> 11:59.749
You're in no position
to do this by yourself.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.301
And there's a communications guy
I used to work with.

12:01.385 --> 12:03.586
I trust him.
I'll talk to him.

12:03.637 --> 12:06.690
Maybe he can help us
find James' guy.

12:06.757 --> 12:09.893
We'll work on this.

12:09.944 --> 12:13.196
You need to go see your mom.

12:28.913 --> 12:31.280
Michael.
I was afraid--

12:31.332 --> 12:33.299
Mom, it's all right.
It's all right.

12:33.384 --> 12:35.085
What does that mean?

12:35.136 --> 12:36.786
Fi got to me.

12:36.837 --> 12:39.839
She got to me
before it was too late.

12:42.643 --> 12:43.893
Where is everybody?

12:43.961 --> 12:45.145
I thought we're supposed
to meet here

12:45.229 --> 12:46.563
at the rally point
if things went wrong.

12:46.630 --> 12:49.432
Plans have changed.

12:49.483 --> 12:52.068
This phone is gonna be
for emergencies.

12:52.136 --> 12:55.355
You need to stay out of sight
for just a little while longer.

12:55.439 --> 12:58.608
Michael, what's going on?

13:00.027 --> 13:02.495
Answer me.
What is going on?

13:02.580 --> 13:04.781
The CIA found out
what I was doing.

13:04.832 --> 13:07.751
They're hunting for us.

13:07.818 --> 13:09.335
So what are you gonna do?

13:09.420 --> 13:11.254
I'm going after James
and his network.

13:11.321 --> 13:12.321
It's our only chance.

13:12.373 --> 13:13.823
Michael, please,

13:13.874 --> 13:15.324
I've seen what those people
can do.

13:15.376 --> 13:16.616
I don't want you going.
Please--

13:16.627 --> 13:19.162
I've made up my mind.

13:21.766 --> 13:26.019
I don't want
to lose another son.

13:26.103 --> 13:30.056
Mom, I can't make
any promises.

13:30.141 --> 13:32.308
Sometimes sacrifices
have to be made.

13:37.982 --> 13:39.949
Charlie's birthday
is coming up soon.

13:40.017 --> 13:42.735
And when I asked him
who he wanted there,

13:42.820 --> 13:46.573
the first person he said
was Uncle Michael.

13:46.657 --> 13:47.957
I don't think
you understand.

13:48.025 --> 13:50.693
We're having
strawberry ice cream.

13:50.744 --> 13:55.364
Do you remember who else loved
strawberry ice cream?

13:55.416 --> 13:58.418
Nate.

13:58.502 --> 14:01.254
If you can't make it
to the party,

14:01.338 --> 14:02.659
what am I supposed
to tell Charlie

14:02.706 --> 14:05.541
when he asks where you are?

14:19.406 --> 14:21.557
I have to go.

14:35.456 --> 14:36.506
- Ooh.
- How'd you do?

14:36.573 --> 14:38.074
My buddy came through.

14:38.125 --> 14:39.959
Snuck me
into the research office.

14:40.044 --> 14:41.678
We checked out all the top
satellite experts in Miami.

14:41.745 --> 14:43.746
I think we hit the jackpot.

14:43.797 --> 14:45.465
That's Max Lyster.
Contracts for the NSA, mostly.

14:45.549 --> 14:47.416
But get this.

14:47.468 --> 14:48.801
A few months ago, he took
a leave from his firm

14:48.886 --> 14:50.253
to work on a special project.

14:50.304 --> 14:51.638
Nobody knows what it was.

14:51.722 --> 14:53.306
James' communication center.

14:53.390 --> 14:55.275
Time frame fits perfectly.

14:55.359 --> 14:57.026
He's our guy.
That's the good news.

14:57.094 --> 14:59.428
The bad news is
he's a security nut.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.264
Lives in a gated community
in the Gables,

15:01.315 --> 15:02.815
consults at a naval base
in the Everglades.

15:02.900 --> 15:05.285
What about hitting him
in transit?

15:05.369 --> 15:06.536
My thoughts exactly.
Sam and Fi are on it.

15:06.603 --> 15:08.271
They're getting supplies.

15:08.322 --> 15:10.823
Jesse, I need
to ask you something.

15:10.908 --> 15:13.326
When we do this tomorrow,
I need you to watch over

15:13.410 --> 15:15.378
my mom and Charlie.

15:15.445 --> 15:16.629
Mike, you guys
are gonna have

15:16.714 --> 15:18.281
your hands full
taking down James.

15:18.332 --> 15:19.615
I need to be there.
I can't do this

15:19.667 --> 15:22.552
without knowing
that they're safe.

15:22.619 --> 15:25.755
Please.

15:25.806 --> 15:28.291
All right, man.

15:28.342 --> 15:31.144
I guess that's how we do it.

15:38.602 --> 15:41.988
Grabbing someone on the move
is all about surprise.

15:42.072 --> 15:44.524
The goal is to get your target
out of his car

15:44.608 --> 15:48.644
and into yours before he knows
what's happening.

15:48.696 --> 15:50.413
If you have the manpower,

15:50.480 --> 15:52.832
it's best to separate
into two teams.

15:52.917 --> 15:54.834
One to track the target's car...

15:54.919 --> 15:57.120
And one to prepare the ambush.

15:57.171 --> 15:58.988
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Lyster's headed your way.

15:59.039 --> 16:01.824
Okay, I'm putting everything
in place right now.

16:10.718 --> 16:13.102
Okay, all set.
What's your E.T.A.?

16:13.170 --> 16:14.503
20 seconds.
Take cover.

16:14.555 --> 16:16.356
Copy that.

16:23.013 --> 16:25.648
Okay, here we go.

16:28.118 --> 16:31.487
Impact in three, two...

16:34.024 --> 16:36.025
Son of a bitch.

16:45.502 --> 16:48.254
You gotta be kidding me.

16:48.339 --> 16:49.672
Yeah, guys, we got a problem.

16:49.723 --> 16:52.008
The tires didn't blow.
The car is armored.

16:52.059 --> 16:53.226
Catch him, Fi.

16:53.310 --> 16:54.761
It's not gonna happen.

16:54.845 --> 16:57.046
We have to, Sam.
He knows we're after him.

16:57.097 --> 16:58.547
If he alerts James,
it's over.

16:58.599 --> 17:00.216
Okay, how?
The car just took

17:00.267 --> 17:02.935
a couple shots of buckshot
at 10 feet without a dent.

17:03.020 --> 17:06.606
What the hell
are you gonna do?

17:06.690 --> 17:08.391
Fi, you still have that C-4
in your bag?

17:08.442 --> 17:11.411
- Yes, but what are you gonna--
- Stay with him!

17:11.494 --> 17:13.061
- Michael, are you gonna--
- Don't lose him!

17:13.113 --> 17:15.748
Pull up alongside him.
Get closer.

17:17.785 --> 17:20.118
Closer, Fi.

17:22.205 --> 17:24.790
- Michael, are you sure?
- Stay with him!

17:33.434 --> 17:35.935
Michael?

17:49.566 --> 17:53.286
Small explosive charges
won't penetrate an armored car,

17:53.370 --> 17:54.370
but that doesn't mean
they're useless.

17:54.438 --> 17:56.239
If you're desperate enough,

17:56.290 --> 17:58.624
a well-placed charge
can come in handy.

18:04.298 --> 18:05.915
An armored car won't drive

18:05.966 --> 18:08.968
if its wheels
aren't on the ground.

18:25.269 --> 18:26.652
Who are you?

18:26.737 --> 18:28.905
- Who we are isn't important.
- What do you want?

18:28.972 --> 18:30.473
You set up
a secret communication center

18:30.524 --> 18:31.607
for James Kendrick.

18:31.658 --> 18:33.576
Where is it?

18:33.643 --> 18:35.611
I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:35.662 --> 18:37.747
Max...

18:37.814 --> 18:40.032
It's not a good idea
to lie to people

18:40.117 --> 18:41.918
with this much gas around.

18:41.985 --> 18:42.919
What are you doing?
You're gonna kill both of us!

18:42.986 --> 18:44.487
Yes, I am,

18:44.538 --> 18:45.872
unless you answer my question!

18:45.956 --> 18:47.540
- Michael!
- Where is it?

18:47.624 --> 18:50.493
Okay! Stop!
Just stop!

18:50.544 --> 18:52.762
Okay, listen,
some guys came to me.

18:52.829 --> 18:54.046
They gave me a bunch of money.

18:54.131 --> 18:57.383
So I did a job for 'em,
and they came back,

18:57.468 --> 19:01.938
and they said if I ever said
anything, I was dead.

19:02.005 --> 19:04.557
It's in a building downtown,
all right?

19:04.641 --> 19:06.509
Good.
You're gonna take us to it.

19:10.052 --> 19:13.003
James has
a communication center in there?

19:13.055 --> 19:15.022
I don't buy it.
I swear.

19:15.107 --> 19:16.724
It's the old <i>Miami Chronicle</i>
building.

19:16.808 --> 19:18.842
They condemned it
after the last hurricane.

19:18.894 --> 19:21.145
These guys could get
any building they want.

19:21.196 --> 19:22.864
Why would they use
some moldy, old place?

19:22.948 --> 19:24.148
The building had
all the tech already--

19:24.199 --> 19:26.016
satellite hookups,
microwave dish array,

19:26.068 --> 19:27.685
all of it.

19:27.736 --> 19:28.852
They bought it
from the demolition team.

19:28.904 --> 19:30.071
I just hooked
into what was there.

19:30.155 --> 19:31.405
It makes sense, Sam.

19:31.490 --> 19:32.573
Near a main road,
no one would notice

19:32.658 --> 19:33.741
anyone going in or out.

19:33.825 --> 19:35.493
Perfectly hidden
in plain sight.

19:35.544 --> 19:37.211
Unbelievable.

19:37.296 --> 19:39.097
How many people are in there?
How many guards?

19:39.131 --> 19:40.915
It's unmanned.
It's just a relay station.

19:40.999 --> 19:42.216
They pick up secure signals,
they decrypt them,

19:42.301 --> 19:43.367
they pass 'em on.

19:43.418 --> 19:44.835
Are there backups
to the system?

19:44.887 --> 19:47.054
Please, he'll kill me.

19:47.139 --> 19:50.174
If we succeed, he's
in no position to kill anyone.

19:50.225 --> 19:52.677
If we don't, well,
you're dead anyway.

19:56.398 --> 19:57.715
Hard drive.

19:57.766 --> 20:00.217
Records everything in case
the power goes out.

20:00.269 --> 20:02.052
That's what we'll bring
to the CIA.

20:02.104 --> 20:03.938
You're gonna tell us where
to find it and how to get it.

20:04.022 --> 20:05.356
And then can I go?

20:05.407 --> 20:06.691
Then you can go back
into the trunk until it's over.

20:08.243 --> 20:10.611
He's serious.
Shut up.

20:10.696 --> 20:12.196
When breaking
into a building,

20:12.247 --> 20:15.116
it's generally best
not to use the door.

20:15.200 --> 20:20.671
Any entrance your enemy knows
you'd use is too risky.

20:20.739 --> 20:24.091
Which means the safest way in
is often the hardest.

20:33.918 --> 20:36.137
Before we do this,
we need to talk.

20:36.221 --> 20:38.422
She's right, Mikey.
It's important.

20:38.473 --> 20:41.592
What you did earlier,
plowing into that store

20:41.643 --> 20:43.963
and then jumping on the car,
almost incinerating yourself--

20:43.979 --> 20:45.229
It was a calculated risk.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.814
I needed information and--
Mike, don't.

20:46.898 --> 20:48.282
We've known each other
too long.

20:48.367 --> 20:50.368
There's a difference
between a necessary risk

20:50.435 --> 20:52.236
and a death wish,
and you know it.

20:53.905 --> 20:55.539
Michael,
I know you're hurting.

20:55.607 --> 20:58.075
I know you regret
what you've done.

20:58.126 --> 21:00.778
But what is killing yourself
gonna prove?

21:00.829 --> 21:03.614
We're wasting time.

21:03.665 --> 21:04.786
Let's do this.

21:16.228 --> 21:17.961
Now we know why James
didn't need guards.

21:18.013 --> 21:20.982
Yeah, he takes
his booby traps seriously.

21:37.416 --> 21:39.617
Well, it's a hell of a place
for a comm center.

21:47.376 --> 21:49.543
Moment of truth.

21:51.930 --> 21:54.682
After you.

21:54.766 --> 21:57.268
Okay.

21:57.335 --> 22:00.104
That should be everything
you and Charlie need.

22:01.473 --> 22:03.858
It's a little overstuffed,

22:03.942 --> 22:05.443
but it just has to last
till we settle down someplace.

22:05.510 --> 22:07.561
When will that be?

22:07.646 --> 22:08.696
Honestly, I don't know.

22:08.780 --> 22:10.815
Soon, hopefully.

22:10.866 --> 22:13.984
Maybe, uh--
Never?

22:14.036 --> 22:15.786
I don't like
to think that way.

22:15.854 --> 22:19.040
But it's best
to be prepared, right?

22:29.718 --> 22:32.219
It's gonna be okay.

22:32.304 --> 22:33.704
It is.
We're together.

22:33.755 --> 22:35.155
We're gonna take care
of each other.

22:35.206 --> 22:36.590
We just need
to get out of state,

22:36.675 --> 22:39.560
find a place to lay low,
set up some new I.D.s.

22:39.644 --> 22:40.644
We'll be good.

22:40.712 --> 22:42.396
Jesse, how can you do this?

22:42.481 --> 22:47.101
With everything that's happened,
you're still here for Michael.

22:47.185 --> 22:49.653
What makes you think
I'm just here for Michael?

22:49.721 --> 22:52.890
You're talking about going
into hiding for years, maybe,

22:52.941 --> 22:55.443
with a bunch of people who have
not made your life very easy.

22:55.527 --> 22:59.780
Haven't you ever wanted
to just...Go?

23:02.534 --> 23:07.254
I have asked myself that same
question many, many times.

23:07.339 --> 23:09.540
I just--I don't know.

23:09.591 --> 23:13.010
When I was a kid,
it was just me and my mom.

23:13.077 --> 23:17.581
And then she got killed,
and then it was just me.

23:17.632 --> 23:20.301
Just me...

23:20.385 --> 23:23.104
Until I met you guys.

23:23.188 --> 23:24.972
I never had a family,

23:25.056 --> 23:26.724
and now I got one.

23:28.092 --> 23:30.611
You do have a family, Jesse.

23:30.695 --> 23:33.063
Sorry.

23:35.317 --> 23:37.451
All right.

23:41.940 --> 23:43.240
Got 'em.
Let's go.

23:45.494 --> 23:46.877
- Uh, it's me.
- Uh, no, Fi.

23:46.945 --> 23:50.548
It's not just you.
It's all our phones.

23:50.615 --> 23:52.783
This is bad.

23:52.834 --> 23:55.118
Anybody have our numbers
besides Maddy?

23:55.170 --> 23:56.119
No.

23:56.171 --> 23:57.388
Hello?

23:57.455 --> 23:58.839
You broke my heart, Michael.

23:58.924 --> 24:02.593
Gave you everything,
and you broke my heart.

24:02.644 --> 24:04.628
It's over, James.

24:04.679 --> 24:06.730
We have your entire network.

24:06.798 --> 24:08.098
It is over.

24:08.150 --> 24:10.133
No, Michael.
I don't think it is over.

24:10.185 --> 24:12.469
Remember the convenience store
you robbed yesterday?

24:12.521 --> 24:15.305
You stole
some mobile phones there.

24:15.357 --> 24:17.241
Well, I tracked them down,
and they led me

24:17.308 --> 24:21.078
to my very own relay station.

24:21.145 --> 24:22.479
Knock, knock,

24:22.531 --> 24:24.815
we're right outside
the control room, Michael.

24:24.866 --> 24:27.451
Oh, and one more thing.

24:27.502 --> 24:33.424
You will never guess where
those other two phones led me.

24:33.491 --> 24:34.959
All right, Maddy, this is it.
You all set?

24:35.010 --> 24:38.295
Yeah.
Got this...got this.

24:38.346 --> 24:39.930
Let's do it.

24:39.998 --> 24:41.999
Oh, my goodness.

24:48.306 --> 24:51.675
What is it, Jesse?

24:51.726 --> 24:53.510
James, this is
between you and me.

24:53.562 --> 24:56.363
Not anymore, Michael.
I like your mama.

24:56.448 --> 24:59.950
And your nephew Charlie's
a lovely boy.

25:00.018 --> 25:01.735
And even though it pains me,
I will not hesitate

25:01.820 --> 25:05.188
to shoot them down like dogs
just like you killed my Sonya.

25:05.240 --> 25:07.124
Leave my family out of this.

25:07.191 --> 25:09.376
The boy is
only three years old.

25:09.461 --> 25:11.078
Michael,
if you want to save them,

25:11.162 --> 25:13.664
you will surrender, you will
tell me what you've done,

25:13.715 --> 25:16.467
and then you will die.

25:19.387 --> 25:20.704
And my friends?

25:20.755 --> 25:24.091
I could use some
bargaining chips with the CIA.

25:24.175 --> 25:27.011
Do as I tell you,
and they'll live.

25:28.647 --> 25:32.182
I just need
just a little more time.

25:34.736 --> 25:36.153
I know you.

25:36.220 --> 25:39.406
You are looking for the answer,
the way out.

25:39.491 --> 25:41.391
There is no way out.

25:41.443 --> 25:43.994
There's only
the reckoning now.

25:44.062 --> 25:48.249
You are out of time,
Michael Westen!

25:48.333 --> 25:50.501
Would you allow me
to call my mother?

25:50.568 --> 25:52.119
Then I'll come out quietly.

25:52.203 --> 25:55.089
Two minutes, no more.

25:55.173 --> 25:56.340
Michael, you-

25:56.407 --> 25:58.042
- Okay, look--
- No.

26:01.579 --> 26:04.798
- Hello?
- Mom, listen to me.

26:04.883 --> 26:06.717
Are there men outside?
Yes.

26:06.768 --> 26:08.269
I have a lot to explain
to you.

26:08.353 --> 26:11.055
There's no need to explain.
He's using us.

26:11.106 --> 26:13.274
Yes, Mom,
and any move I make

26:13.358 --> 26:15.109
is gonna get
the three of you killed.

26:15.193 --> 26:18.279
So I'm gonna have to give him
what he wants.

26:18.363 --> 26:20.364
No! Don't you give that man
a damn thing.

26:20.431 --> 26:21.782
Ma, you don't understand.
You and Charlie--

26:21.866 --> 26:23.567
I do understand, Michael.

26:23.618 --> 26:26.269
And Charlie's gonna be fine.

26:26.321 --> 26:28.872
What are you talking about?

26:28.940 --> 26:30.273
I found a way
to buy Jesse and Charlie

26:30.325 --> 26:32.493
a chance to get out of here.

26:32.577 --> 26:34.578
Ma, I don't know
what you're planning, but--

26:34.629 --> 26:35.996
Michael!

26:36.081 --> 26:37.381
You said it yourself.

26:37.448 --> 26:40.951
Sometimes...
Sacrifices must be made.

26:41.002 --> 26:45.923
In the bag of supplies,
there was an explosive charge.

26:48.292 --> 26:49.960
Mom...Don't.

26:50.011 --> 26:51.512
Please, don't do--
listen to me.

26:51.596 --> 26:53.036
There's no remote detonator,
Michael,

26:53.064 --> 26:54.732
and there's no time
to build one.

26:54.799 --> 26:57.484
Michael, you have
protected me enough,

26:57.569 --> 26:59.820
and now you need my help.

26:59.904 --> 27:02.773
If saving you means
I don't get out of here,

27:02.824 --> 27:04.908
it's fine with me.

27:04.976 --> 27:08.412
God knows I've failed you
enough times in the past.

27:08.479 --> 27:12.149
Give me this, please.

27:12.200 --> 27:15.586
Michael, listen to me.

27:15.653 --> 27:17.320
You made mistakes.

27:17.372 --> 27:19.256
We all did.

27:22.510 --> 27:25.495
But I am so proud
of the man you are.

27:25.547 --> 27:30.017
I always have been.

27:30.101 --> 27:33.687
I love you, Michael.

27:38.226 --> 27:41.478
I love you.

27:41.529 --> 27:44.448
Goodbye, baby.

27:44.515 --> 27:47.350
Goodbye, Mom.

27:54.209 --> 27:56.160
It's time.

27:56.211 --> 28:00.864
Maddy...
There has to be another way.

28:00.915 --> 28:02.332
There is no other way.

28:02.384 --> 28:05.636
Those men outside
are about to break in here,

28:05.703 --> 28:09.923
and somebody's gotta be here
to...Use this thing.

28:10.008 --> 28:11.849
No! This is crazy.
I'm not letting you do this.

28:11.893 --> 28:14.228
Jesse, this has nothing to do
with you and me.

28:14.312 --> 28:16.814
It has everything to do
with that boy.

28:16.881 --> 28:20.550
This is just a distraction, and
it'll take a lot of them out,

28:20.602 --> 28:22.069
but you gotta fight your way
out of here.

28:22.153 --> 28:23.720
I can't do that.
You can.

28:23.772 --> 28:27.908
It's as simple as that.

28:31.579 --> 28:34.498
Charlie, honey?
Come here, baby.

28:34.565 --> 28:36.333
That's my boy.
Come here.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.903
Come here, sweetheart.
Hmm.

28:39.954 --> 28:41.905
Look at me.

28:41.956 --> 28:43.457
Do you know grandma loves you?

28:43.541 --> 28:47.511
And she would do anything,
anything in the world

28:47.578 --> 28:49.012
to protect you.

28:49.080 --> 28:50.580
Now, I want you
to go with Jesse.

28:50.632 --> 28:52.216
And you're gonna play
a game, okay?

28:52.267 --> 28:54.768
You're gonna hide and just
shut your eyes really tight,

28:54.853 --> 28:56.253
and you cover your ears.

28:56.304 --> 28:58.689
You do that for me?

28:58.756 --> 29:00.757
You give me a hug.

29:00.809 --> 29:04.111
Come here, baby.

29:22.497 --> 29:24.832
You gotta go now.

29:24.916 --> 29:28.451
Go, Jesse, please.

29:28.503 --> 29:31.388
Bye, Charlie.

29:37.748 --> 29:40.750
Mike, you gotta call her back!
This is crazy!

29:44.171 --> 29:46.339
The subscriber you have called

29:46.423 --> 29:47.757
is not available.
Please hang up and--

29:47.824 --> 29:50.176
Son of a bitch!

29:55.432 --> 29:58.351
Michael, we don't have
much time.

29:58.435 --> 30:00.436
What do you want to do?

30:00.504 --> 30:03.389
I wanna fight.

30:03.474 --> 30:05.975
I'm gonna take James down.

30:06.026 --> 30:07.944
I'm gonna get the drives
to the CIA.

30:08.011 --> 30:11.447
Now, my mom bought me
a second chance.

30:11.515 --> 30:13.182
I owe it to her to use it.

30:13.233 --> 30:16.068
All right, brother.

30:16.153 --> 30:18.321
Let's do this.

30:18.372 --> 30:22.525
Five seconds.
We go on my signal.

30:22.576 --> 30:24.026
James, I'm coming out!

30:25.329 --> 30:26.829
Michael!

30:26.880 --> 30:30.416
I was beginning to wonder
if we understood each other.

30:30.501 --> 30:33.002
We understand
each other fine.

30:33.053 --> 30:34.870
Fiona's coming out.

30:34.922 --> 30:38.174
She's gonna talk terms
for the others.

30:38.225 --> 30:40.176
There's nothing to negotiate,

30:40.227 --> 30:45.148
but if she wants to talk,
we will talk.

30:45.215 --> 30:48.734
Besides, I'd like her
to watch you die.

30:48.819 --> 30:51.554
That's far enough, Michael.
You can stop right there.

30:54.825 --> 30:56.559
Shall we shoot them?

31:10.841 --> 31:13.092
- I only got one.
- I only got one.

31:27.524 --> 31:30.193
Tommy!
Get him!

31:31.945 --> 31:36.532
Move in, kill Madeline Westen
and the boy, now.

31:54.551 --> 31:57.169
This one's for my boys.

32:19.359 --> 32:21.810
Look at me.
You stay right here, okay?

32:21.862 --> 32:23.446
Do not move.
Cover your ears, buddy.

32:23.497 --> 32:25.665
Cover 'em up.

32:32.589 --> 32:35.324
You ready to go, buddy?

32:35.375 --> 32:38.094
Let's go.

33:19.386 --> 33:20.869
Aah!

33:20.921 --> 33:22.204
I'm out.

33:22.255 --> 33:23.889
I have half a clip.

33:23.974 --> 33:25.708
It's a valiant effort,
Michael!

33:25.759 --> 33:27.843
Noble!

33:27.894 --> 33:30.813
You're only delaying
the inevitable!

33:30.880 --> 33:34.150
This is over!

33:34.217 --> 33:36.235
You know it!

33:42.776 --> 33:44.727
James' men are devoted
to him.

33:44.778 --> 33:46.579
If I make a run for him,

33:46.663 --> 33:48.303
they'll come out from cover
to defend him.

33:48.365 --> 33:51.667
If you're fast,
you can take out the last two.

33:51.735 --> 33:53.252
And then what?

33:53.337 --> 33:55.588
You don't even have a gun.

33:55.672 --> 33:57.173
You'll have
to lend me yours.

33:57.240 --> 34:00.343
Well, that's not possible.

34:00.410 --> 34:02.077
If this is
about your death wish--

34:02.129 --> 34:04.680
I want to live.

34:04.748 --> 34:06.932
Maybe more than I ever have.

34:16.610 --> 34:18.978
When you put it that way...

34:47.007 --> 34:48.808
Michael!

35:11.698 --> 35:15.000
It's over, James.

35:16.336 --> 35:18.587
So what now?

35:18.655 --> 35:20.656
You gonna turn me in?

35:20.707 --> 35:23.926
You gonna hand me over
to the CIA?

35:25.662 --> 35:28.330
What are you looking for?

35:28.381 --> 35:29.765
Redemption?

35:29.833 --> 35:31.500
You want your old life back?

35:31.551 --> 35:32.852
It's gone.

35:32.936 --> 35:35.020
It was gone when you decided

35:35.105 --> 35:38.107
that she was more important
than anything else.

35:38.174 --> 35:40.476
I know.

35:42.729 --> 35:45.347
Time to go.
Not gonna happen.

35:45.398 --> 35:46.816
You don't have a choice.

35:46.867 --> 35:49.952
There's always a choice,
Michael.

35:50.019 --> 35:55.241
Those explosives you saw
on the way in...

35:55.325 --> 35:59.712
They're not just
for keeping people out.

35:59.796 --> 36:01.029
Michael,
that's a dead man switch.

36:01.081 --> 36:02.882
It didn't have to be
this way.

36:02.966 --> 36:04.300
We could have done
amazing things together.

36:04.367 --> 36:07.386
We could have
changed the world.

36:07.471 --> 36:09.388
Ah!
Another life.

37:04.219 --> 37:06.804
- Thanks for coming.
- Well, we didn't have a choice.

37:06.871 --> 37:08.712
Your guys walked us in
from the detention area.

37:08.757 --> 37:13.227
I know this has been a hard
time for a lot of reasons.

37:13.312 --> 37:15.846
I can't really get
into all the details,

37:15.897 --> 37:18.099
but I wanted you to know
that we have tracked down

37:18.183 --> 37:21.218
over a hundred operatives
worldwide who were working

37:21.270 --> 37:23.111
for James' network,
and they were in a position

37:23.155 --> 37:25.573
to do a lot of damage.

37:25.657 --> 37:28.576
Well, I guess that's something
to think about...

37:28.660 --> 37:30.728
During the long nights
in our cells.

37:30.779 --> 37:35.116
About your detention,
there are a lot of people here

37:35.200 --> 37:37.251
who want to leave you there.

37:37.336 --> 37:38.869
They're just not
in a forgiving mood.

37:38.920 --> 37:43.124
Well...figures as much.

37:43.208 --> 37:45.793
You know spies...
Bunch of bitchy little girls.

37:47.379 --> 37:50.765
Yeah, sometimes.

37:50.849 --> 37:54.852
Fact is,
you're the heroes of this Op.

37:54.919 --> 37:57.388
So I played
a little bureaucratic hardball,

37:57.439 --> 37:59.390
and, uh, I got you cleared.

37:59.441 --> 38:02.092
You can go.

38:02.144 --> 38:03.611
What do you mean?

38:03.695 --> 38:06.447
I mean there's a car
waiting for you downstairs.

38:06.531 --> 38:09.817
They'll take you.

38:09.901 --> 38:12.436
Oh, hey, um, one more thing.

38:12.487 --> 38:15.906
The wall downstairs,
the memorial to the agents

38:15.957 --> 38:17.625
fallen in the line of duty?

38:17.709 --> 38:21.779
Michael's gonna get his star.

38:21.830 --> 38:24.799
Thank you.

38:34.309 --> 38:39.146
A spy is never truly done
being a spy until he's dead.

38:39.231 --> 38:42.800
It's part of you.
The skills, the secrets...

38:42.851 --> 38:45.019
They never go away.

38:45.103 --> 38:48.022
And as long as you can
be useful to someone,

38:48.106 --> 38:51.108
it's your fate to always be
a spy.

38:54.479 --> 38:57.415
But if there's one thing
spies are bad at,

38:57.482 --> 39:00.785
it's accepting fate.

39:52.137 --> 39:56.390
Well, they missed
a good funeral.

39:56.475 --> 39:58.225
Where do you think they are?

39:58.310 --> 40:00.227
Hard to say.

40:00.312 --> 40:04.214
Lot of places in the world
with C-4 and yogurt.

40:04.266 --> 40:05.986
We'll hear from them
when the time is right.

40:06.017 --> 40:07.685
Yeah.

40:07.736 --> 40:10.438
Got any plans?

40:10.522 --> 40:13.023
Not really, no.
You?

40:13.074 --> 40:15.526
I'm supposed to meet a guy
later at the Carlito.

40:15.577 --> 40:17.995
Friend of Elsa's.
Yeah? What about?

40:18.062 --> 40:20.998
I don't know.
Some kind of problem.

40:21.065 --> 40:25.235
Sounded pretty desperate
on the phone.

40:25.287 --> 40:28.923
Wanna come with?

40:29.007 --> 40:30.040
You buying the mojitos?

40:30.091 --> 40:34.044
Deal.

40:34.095 --> 40:39.099
Good luck, Mike...
Wherever you are.

41:21.292 --> 41:23.143
- How's he doing?
- I think he's okay.

41:23.228 --> 41:24.895
He just fell asleep
like this.

41:24.963 --> 41:28.015
Should I, um--

41:28.099 --> 41:30.935
Oh, no, I think he's fine.

41:38.109 --> 41:39.743
What will I tell him
when he's older?

41:39.811 --> 41:43.697
About what?

41:43.782 --> 41:46.367
About me.

41:48.537 --> 41:51.455
Tell him the truth.

41:53.675 --> 41:57.094
Where would I start?

41:59.714 --> 42:03.467
Start from the beginning.

42:03.518 --> 42:06.353
Start with...

42:06.438 --> 42:11.025
"My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy."
