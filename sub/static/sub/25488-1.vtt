<i> Previously on</i> Power...

00:10.302 --> 00:11.804
You were never here.

00:11.846 --> 00:13.221
<i></i>

00:13.263 --> 00:14.556
<i>Entiendes?</i>

00:14.598 --> 00:17.100
Maria Suarez, this is US Attorney Tameika Robinson.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.644
Would you please tell her your story?

00:18.686 --> 00:20.646
Look there was this cop at school looking for you today.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.857
-Officer Raymond Jones.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.692
I know who you are, Ray Ray.

00:26.986 --> 00:28.737
I think I know who killed Ghost's little girl.

00:28.779 --> 00:29.864
Fuck you talking about?

00:29.905 --> 00:31.114
Raymond Jones.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.407
<i> He a dirty cop.</i>

00:32.449 --> 00:34.075
Yo, T, we found out who killed Raina.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.577
<i> It wasn't Raina</i> <i>they was after.</i>

00:35.619 --> 00:36.745
<i>It was Tariq.</i>

00:36.787 --> 00:39.206
See, your sister, at least she stepped up.

00:42.209 --> 00:45.086
-I'm not sorry. -I'm not sorry, either.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.506
<i> When we go upstairs,</i> <i>you're gonna get in the shower</i>

00:47.548 --> 00:50.384
<i>and wash every bit of this day</i> <i>down the drain.</i>

00:50.425 --> 00:54.513
I can either be your lover or your lawyer.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.639
But not both.

00:55.681 --> 00:57.349
Will you take my case?

00:57.391 --> 00:58.809
How we looking with that other thing, though?

00:58.851 --> 01:00.019
Going down as we speak.

01:01.896 --> 01:05.315
Hey, you're Tony Teresi's kid, that's good enough for me.

01:07.359 --> 01:08.652
No, no, no, we good.

01:08.694 --> 01:10.988
What the fuck? That's Taino's.

01:11.030 --> 01:12.781
These motherfuckers are Cristobal's guys.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.157
Who the fuck is Cristobal?

01:14.199 --> 01:15.409
He and Dre, they tight like this.

01:15.450 --> 01:16.952
I'm gonna fuck Dre up.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.246
I want out. I don't like the way you work.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.958
<i> He's with the fucking</i> <i>Jimenez, man.</i>

01:23.000 --> 01:24.835
<i>We can't just roll up</i> <i>and shoot the motherfucker.</i>

01:24.877 --> 01:26.962
It'll take more planning, more soldiers.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.296
I may have some people.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.634
<i> There's a bullet</i> <i>in there.</i>

01:32.676 --> 01:34.762

I'd want revenge.

03:24.913 --> 03:25.914
What's in the bag?

03:25.956 --> 03:26.915
It's just a suit.

03:28.167 --> 03:29.292
-Tasha. -I need your help.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.503
Tariq is missing. No police.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.381
James said you cloned his phone once.

03:34.422 --> 03:37.384
Okay, Tariq is in Washington Heights.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.057
He's gonna make a move, Angela.

03:43.098 --> 03:45.851
And when he does, it's gonna be the perfect

03:43.098 --> 03:45.851
opportunity to take him down.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.437
Tasha, where is James right now?

03:52.566 --> 03:53.984
Angela Valdes?

03:55.861 --> 03:57.320
Miss Valdes?

04:00.448 --> 04:03.118
-Sergeant Rafael Hiciano.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.536
Can I talk to you for a moment?

04:06.287 --> 04:08.749
The CSI guys already pulled the bullet from the wall.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.709
Looks like a .380.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.086
.380?

04:12.127 --> 04:14.171
We're gonna take it over to ballistics,

04:14.213 --> 04:16.631
see if we hit the jackpot and it's already been used

04:14.213 --> 04:16.631
in a crime.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.093
-Hmm.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.595
This city's the gift that keeps on giving.

04:21.636 --> 04:24.139
You suits usually aren't much help on a crime scene.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.183
Ortiz had to go notify next of kin,

04:26.225 --> 04:28.351
but he told me you found the bullet hole yourself?

04:28.393 --> 04:30.062
Yeah, I did.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.772
So let me get a statement from you for the future

04:31.813 --> 04:33.899
when this turns into a murder investigation.

04:35.483 --> 04:38.403
I don't think you'll need me, Sergeant Hiciano.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.740
Let the CSIs take the credit. You can leave me out

04:38.445 --> 04:41.740
of your report.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.911
Since Detective Jones isn't here,

04:45.953 --> 04:47.871
there's no reason for me to be here, either.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.506
Internal Affairs got called in already?

04:58.548 --> 05:00.884
We don't even know if Detective Jones

04:58.548 --> 05:00.884
did anything wrong.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.803
In my experience, Hiciano,

05:02.844 --> 05:06.306
if it looks wrong, it's usually wrong.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.267
Who's that in the heels?

05:08.308 --> 05:11.311
Federal Prosecutor. Head of Criminal

05:08.308 --> 05:11.311
for the Eastern District.

05:11.352 --> 05:14.773
Angela Valdes. Fucking Feds.

05:14.815 --> 05:18.026
Walks all over my crime scene, won't even be in my report.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.778
Valdes, huh?

05:34.417 --> 05:37.254
Oh, shit.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.930
Yo.

05:46.972 --> 05:47.931
Yo, what happened?

05:47.973 --> 05:50.142
I can't speak right now.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.568
Cristobal?

06:00.610 --> 06:02.403
Meet up, man. We got a problem.

06:11.205 --> 06:15.334
Hey, where's Tariq

06:18.461 --> 06:19.963
I haven't seen him since you brought him home.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.008
What's going on with him, Tasha?

06:23.050 --> 06:26.594
And what's going on with you

06:26.636 --> 06:28.138
Tasha, answer me.

06:28.180 --> 06:32.059
Look, I need you to say, if anyone ask...

06:32.100 --> 06:34.728
We were both here all night.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.230
Who's gonna ask?

06:38.190 --> 06:40.692
I don't think anyone is gonna ask, okay?

06:44.363 --> 06:45.989
You wanna be straight with me, Tasha?

06:48.075 --> 06:50.285
What happened?

06:53.330 --> 06:54.248
I need your help.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.130
We'll talk about this in the morning, okay?

07:05.217 --> 07:06.801
Good night, Tasha.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.686
We need to find somebody that can't be traced to us

07:16.728 --> 07:18.646
in case the Jimenez figure it out.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.400
Shit, I can do it. Dre don't even know I'm alive.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.568
He get dead, and whoever the Jimenez is,

07:23.610 --> 07:24.778
they don't even know to look for me.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.613
They never heard of my ass.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.907
That's smart, K.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.076
Yeah, long as Dre hasn't figured out

07:31.118 --> 07:33.536
his Taino hitters never made it back home.

07:36.373 --> 07:37.832
Come on in.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.210
Whoa, whoa, how we know we can trust you, K?

07:40.252 --> 07:42.337
You set me on fire, nigga, not the other way around.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.965
Yeah, but K, you ain't the forgiving type, nigga.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.965
You know that.

07:45.006 --> 07:48.969
I could have shot you both 20-11 times already.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.346
Get out the way, man.

07:51.388 --> 07:55.016
So we can figure out how to kill this little

07:51.388 --> 07:55.016
light-skinned nigga.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.977
Dre's the problem, right?

07:57.018 --> 07:58.019
Right.

08:00.355 --> 08:05.235
Are you sure Tommy Egan called the other man Ghost?

08:05.277 --> 08:09.030
I never heard the name Tommy Egan.

08:05.277 --> 08:09.030
I told you that.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.866
The man he called Ghost sent me home.

08:11.908 --> 08:15.996
-Fiance.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.497
We were engaged.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.209
I don't know what happened. I never saw Miguel again.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.049
You're absolutely sure?

08:28.091 --> 08:30.635
James St. Patrick, the man you heard

08:28.091 --> 08:30.635
on the television.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.346
He is Ghost?

08:32.387 --> 08:36.391
I'll never forget his voice. He is Ghost.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.315
Wait here.

08:43.357 --> 08:46.776
If she's telling the truth, James St. Patrick

08:43.357 --> 08:46.776
was Ghost all along.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.070
-Greg was right. -Don't get ahead of yourself.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.947
Miss Suarez said that she didn't see anything, right?

08:50.989 --> 08:53.658
She was blindfolded. An aural ID isn't worth much.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.036
Come on, you think she can't recognize a voice?

08:56.077 --> 08:58.579
I think the average person can't tell the difference

08:56.077 --> 08:58.579
between George Clooney

08:58.621 --> 09:00.290
and Kurt Russell on tape.

09:00.332 --> 09:03.460
If I was St. Patrick's defense attorney,

09:00.332 --> 09:03.460
I'd be all over that.

09:03.502 --> 09:06.254
And if it's this office and we start up with

09:03.502 --> 09:06.254
St. Patrick again,

09:06.296 --> 09:07.839
it's gonna look like a vendetta.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.883
I agree. If we're going down

09:07.881 --> 09:09.883
this road again,

09:09.924 --> 09:12.219
it better be a bulletproof case.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.679
Still, she couldn't be a more sympathetic witness.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.764
You believe her.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.683
Let's get her statement.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.395
I'm not moving forward officially until

09:18.725 --> 09:21.395
Angela weighs in.

09:21.436 --> 09:25.106
If it concerns St. Patrick, we can't let this get

09:21.436 --> 09:25.106
anywhere near Angela.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.941
We need a full Chinese wall here.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.987
-Sorry. -One, I'm Korean.

09:31.029 --> 09:34.408
And two, the wall is actually in China.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.659
It's not racist if it's true.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.287
-Now you need to apologize.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.415
I'll take your point, Saxe.

09:41.456 --> 09:44.334
Angela wouldn't touch a St. Patrick case

09:41.456 --> 09:44.334
for appearances' sake,

09:44.376 --> 09:46.253
but she can evaluate the strength of a case,

09:46.294 --> 09:48.796
and certainly of this witness.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.258
Where is Angela, anyway?

09:52.384 --> 09:54.052
Why are you blowing me up?

09:54.094 --> 09:55.678
What's all this about, Angela?

09:55.720 --> 09:58.557
Tariq was never missing, was he?

09:58.598 --> 10:01.017
Detective Raymond Jones is missing.

10:01.059 --> 10:04.521
But if the blood and brain matter on the floor of his flop

10:01.059 --> 10:04.521
house are any indication,

10:04.563 --> 10:06.647
he's dead, and Jamie killed him.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.691
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:08.733 --> 10:12.404
Raymond Jones, the police officer I told you

10:08.733 --> 10:12.404
I went to see.

10:12.446 --> 10:15.532
The officer I told you was looking into Tariq's

10:12.446 --> 10:15.532
witness statements.

10:15.574 --> 10:18.159
The officer I told you I suspected of killing Raina.

10:18.201 --> 10:19.994
-Angela, look, I didn't...

10:20.036 --> 10:22.789
And then you told me to track a phone.

10:22.830 --> 10:26.251
And you told me it was Tariq's. And I believed you.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.712
-It was Tariq's phone! -Raymond Jones had the phone,

10:26.293 --> 10:29.712
is that it?

10:29.754 --> 10:33.091
I told you he was Raina's killer,

10:29.754 --> 10:33.091
but you already knew that.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.218
You just needed to find him.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.054
I gave you the location, and now he's dead.

10:38.096 --> 10:41.891
I gave you means, motive, and opportunity

10:38.096 --> 10:41.891
right in that room.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.604
Jamie killed a New York City cop,

10:45.645 --> 10:47.481
and I'm a fucking accessory because I believed you.

10:47.522 --> 10:50.108
Ghost didn't kill anyone. And I didn't trick you.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.819
-I used the location to find Tariq.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.819
-No, you didn't.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.614
-And I found him. -Bullshit.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.991
I'm gonna have to turn you all in now, Tasha.

11:04.539 --> 11:07.584
And I'm gonna have to testify against you and Jamie.

11:07.626 --> 11:08.835
Tariq shot him.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.049
With my gun.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.675
Tariq?

11:18.512 --> 11:20.597
I didn't lie to you.

11:20.639 --> 11:23.475
I was looking for him to stop him.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.768
Look, no one is going to jail, Angela.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.438
No one even knows anything you just said.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.524
I handled it. I took every precaution.

11:30.565 --> 11:34.152
-You don't understand. -No, you don't understand.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.947
I just came from the crime scene, Tasha.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.782
They pulled a bullet from the wall.

11:39.824 --> 11:40.992
Shit.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.787
Where's your gun right now?

11:44.829 --> 11:48.291
It's gone. Reported stolen. It's gone.

11:48.333 --> 11:51.294
When I executed the search warrant on your apartment,

11:51.336 --> 11:52.711
we took your gun.

11:52.753 --> 11:55.215
We ran the ballistics. It's in the system.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.551
It's gonna trace back to you, and then we're all

11:55.256 --> 11:57.551
going to jail.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.844
Wait a minute. How much time do we have?

11:59.886 --> 12:02.389
Before they compare the bullets to the records from my gun?

12:02.430 --> 12:05.433
24, 30 hours.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.686
Is there anything you can do to stop it?

12:11.022 --> 12:13.233
I didn't want this to happen, Angela.

12:13.274 --> 12:16.444
But we are here now, and I cannot lose two children

12:16.486 --> 12:18.613
to that goddamn cop.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.783
You want me to bury the records?

12:25.161 --> 12:28.707
If they never match your gun, they might not trace any

12:25.161 --> 12:28.707
of this back to you.

12:28.747 --> 12:29.957
Or you.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.548
Where the fuck have you been?

12:36.590 --> 12:39.384
Look, man, I had to settle a debt.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.384
Or at least I thought so.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.596
So, what's up, C? It's been a long fucking night

12:39.426 --> 12:42.596
already, my man.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.472
Yeah, well, it's about to get a little bit longer.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.140
Talk to me.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.142
Those hitters I sent to take out Kanan.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.561
Mmm-hmm.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.730
They never came back.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.898
Oh, fuck.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.567
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense, man.

12:55.609 --> 12:59.112
Those are two of my best. Kanan's not Superman.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.072
No, no, no, he's Superman.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.409
If Superman was mean as shit and half burnt to a crisp.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.704
Okay, so now we gotta keep our head on a swivel for Kanan.

13:07.746 --> 13:09.830
It's not just Kanan, C.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.041
Tommy knows we set up Julio.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.418
Callahan told me.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.002
Is that why he wasn't at the meet tonight?

13:15.044 --> 13:16.588
No, he quit the organization over it.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.006
He said he didn't like the way I do business.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.760
So, I had to shut his mouth, man.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.678
You know what I'm saying?

13:23.720 --> 13:25.012
You killed a priest?

13:27.474 --> 13:30.727
-What... Damn, Dre. -Wait, no, no, Cris, Cris,

13:30.769 --> 13:32.687
I didn't want a little Tommy-owned bitch

13:32.729 --> 13:34.272
running around with shit to say

13:34.314 --> 13:36.566
about you and me, collar or no goddamned collar.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.152
How did Tommy know we did Julio?

13:41.112 --> 13:43.615
-Uriel.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.533
Mmm.

13:45.575 --> 13:48.119
Who Alicia just told us is dead.

13:48.161 --> 13:52.707
That means... That means Tommy probably pulled

13:48.161 --> 13:52.707
the fucking trigger.

13:52.749 --> 13:57.378
Or was it Ghost

13:57.420 --> 14:00.423
So Tommy, Ghost, and Kanan, they're all after us.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.091
Yeah.

14:02.133 --> 14:04.010
Maybe we let Alicia and Diego handle this problem.

14:04.051 --> 14:06.513
No. No, no, no, no.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.807
Alicia said no war.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.057
That's why she signed on with us.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.934
Listen, man, I made a promise.

14:11.976 --> 14:15.772
C, I gotta keep my word, all right?

14:15.814 --> 14:19.484
But if we are the target,

14:19.526 --> 14:22.236
then we can use that to our advantage.

14:22.278 --> 14:25.573
All we gotta do is let them know where to find us.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.837
-Hey, Sis. -Hey, Tommy.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.053
What the hell is Kanan doing here?

14:47.094 --> 14:49.055
And why are you with him?

14:49.096 --> 14:52.308
-We'll talk about it later,

14:49.096 --> 14:52.308
Tasha.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.435
-James. -Councilman.

14:54.477 --> 14:55.436
-So good to see you. -My wife.

14:55.478 --> 14:57.104
Of course.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.816
Mrs. St. Patrick, I'm truly sorry for your loss.

14:59.858 --> 15:01.818
Tariq. Ready to go inside?

15:01.860 --> 15:03.319
Reverend Macedon is waiting.

15:13.204 --> 15:16.165
We've owned this facility for quite some time.

15:16.207 --> 15:18.752
Since we were expecting quite a crowd,

15:18.793 --> 15:21.379
we thought we'd have Raina's service here.

15:21.421 --> 15:25.132
It's less intimate, but we thought

15:21.421 --> 15:25.132
it was more fitting

15:25.174 --> 15:28.135
to celebrate Raina's transition.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.555
Well, I'll give a homily, of course.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.849
We were thinking that your family and friends

15:32.891 --> 15:34.893
would be in the first few pews.

15:34.934 --> 15:38.813
-And then... -The press would be set up,

15:34.934 --> 15:38.813
uh, here and here.

15:38.855 --> 15:43.484
Or perhaps in the fifth or sixth row so they can have

15:38.855 --> 15:43.484
and unimpeded view.

15:43.526 --> 15:47.363
Wait a minute. You already discussed this?

15:43.526 --> 15:47.363
You already decided?

15:47.405 --> 15:48.698
Well, Tasha, our first duty is to Raina.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.700
Yes, of course, but I don't think...

15:50.742 --> 15:52.786
The QCP, The Queens Child Project

15:50.742 --> 15:52.786
that Councilman Tate and I

15:52.827 --> 15:55.747
are building. We're gonna dedicate it

15:52.827 --> 15:55.747
to Raina.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.207
We are?

15:58.249 --> 16:01.461
We are, and I wanna do anything I can, obviously,

15:58.249 --> 16:01.461
to commemorate our daughter

16:01.502 --> 16:04.088
and to help move this project forward.

16:04.130 --> 16:08.175
So if Councilman Tate and if Rashad feels like having

16:04.130 --> 16:08.175
press here and seeing us

16:08.217 --> 16:11.554
in the church mourning our daughter will help donations,

16:08.217 --> 16:11.554
give us support,

16:11.596 --> 16:14.432
-then I'll do it. -It's a tremendous

16:11.596 --> 16:14.432
opportunity.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.518
My daughter is dead.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.813
That's not a goddamn opportunity.

16:19.854 --> 16:22.816
Mrs. St. Patrick, everyone's nerves are frazzled.

16:22.857 --> 16:25.192
This is a horrible time for you.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.361
For your family.

16:27.403 --> 16:30.448
We'll make sure that the press is carefully selected

16:27.403 --> 16:30.448
and unobtrusive.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.867
Absolutely.

16:32.909 --> 16:36.746
And we were thinking perhaps Tariq here might want to do

16:32.909 --> 16:36.746
his sister's eulogy.

16:36.788 --> 16:37.872
-No. -No, that's not...

16:37.914 --> 16:38.873
-Uh, that's... -No.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.124
I'll do it.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.463
I'd like to do it.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.882
-I want to. -I knew he would do it,

16:45.505 --> 16:47.882
Reverend.

16:47.924 --> 16:50.802
-Wonderful. -What a fine young man

16:47.924 --> 16:50.802
you are, Tariq.

16:50.844 --> 16:54.514
And I'm pretty sure that your parents are very proud

16:50.844 --> 16:54.514
of the young man that you are.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.020
Why don't we take a look at the reception hall?

17:01.061 --> 17:03.272
Shall we Please.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.194
Yo, was Tariq already there when y'all clipped Ray Ray?

17:08.235 --> 17:11.071
He saw y'all do that shit?

17:11.113 --> 17:13.449
No, Tariq wasn't there. We got to Ray Ray first.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.660
Tariq got there after.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.539
How's he hanging in there, with his sister and all?

17:19.580 --> 17:21.791
Eh, you know, he good.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.419
Don't worry about Tariq, K.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.881
Family got his back.

17:27.922 --> 17:31.258
Feels like you forgetting if I didn't call,

17:27.922 --> 17:31.258
Tariq would be dead.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.804
I also know that Tariq would have never met this

17:31.300 --> 17:34.804
Ray Ray motherfucker

17:34.846 --> 17:36.848
if you didn't introduce him.

17:36.890 --> 17:40.018
You stop fucking with Tariq, K, and you and me, we cool.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.527
Tariq.

17:50.486 --> 17:51.863
Go sit down.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.240
Now.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.336
Why was Ray Ray following you?

18:07.378 --> 18:10.006
-It matters.

18:10.965 --> 18:13.509
Why was he following you?

18:13.551 --> 18:15.261
I wanna know why he killed your sister.

18:17.847 --> 18:20.474
Go ahead, tell you mother about your little punk-ass life

18:17.847 --> 18:20.474
of crime.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.268
Yeah, I know all about the licks with Kanan,

18:20.516 --> 18:22.268
the stealing,

18:22.309 --> 18:23.937
the whole fucking thing. Go ahead, tell her.

18:23.978 --> 18:25.646
Wait a minute, with Kanan

18:25.688 --> 18:28.190
Kanan is the reason we found Tariq and Ray Ray at all.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.359
No, Dre is the problem, Tasha.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.486
Look at me.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.573
How did Dre know Ray Ray?

18:35.615 --> 18:37.992
And why would he send you to confront him about

18:35.615 --> 18:37.992
your sister?

18:38.034 --> 18:39.911
-You're just a little kid. -I'm not a little kid.

18:39.953 --> 18:42.413
-Yes, the fuck you are! -Ghost, please.

18:48.419 --> 18:50.755
How did Dre know Ray Ray? Answer the question.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.054
You gonna answer these questions.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.141
He met him at Kanan's place after I did.

19:05.019 --> 19:07.063
And how long did Dre know Kanan was back?

19:09.941 --> 19:12.443
Listen, listen. Dre told me to stay away

19:09.941 --> 19:12.443
from him.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.570
I told Dre I was gonna tell you that he knew about Kanan

19:14.612 --> 19:16.823
if he didn't tell me where Ray Ray was.

19:16.864 --> 19:19.826
That, and I held Mom's gun on him until he said something.

19:19.867 --> 19:23.203
Tariq, you are so lucky that he did not shoot you.

19:23.245 --> 19:26.248
The moment you left him, Dre should have called me

19:23.245 --> 19:26.248
or your Uncle Tommy

19:26.290 --> 19:27.625
or Kanan.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.044
Since he knew how to fucking find him,

19:30.086 --> 19:33.047
or, he should have taken away your mother's gun from you,

19:30.086 --> 19:33.047
given you the wrong address,

19:33.089 --> 19:34.757
I don't know. Any fucking thing.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.843
The little motherfucker sent you to Ray Ray to die.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.761
No, I wanted to make it right for Raina.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.721
I did the right thing, didn't I?

19:40.763 --> 19:42.264
What would you have done if you were me, Pa?

19:42.306 --> 19:44.224
-Look, look.

19:44.266 --> 19:47.687
What you could have done is told your father about Ray Ray,

19:47.728 --> 19:49.063
or you could have told Uncle Tommy.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.148
Or me.

19:52.566 --> 19:55.028
How long did Raina know you were in trouble

19:52.566 --> 19:55.028
with Ray Ray?

19:56.946 --> 19:58.364
Why didn't she tell me?

20:02.035 --> 20:03.077
Tariq.

20:04.078 --> 20:05.830
She told me everything.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.999
Why didn't she tell me?

20:10.334 --> 20:13.504
-Riq! -'Cause he told her not to,

20:10.334 --> 20:13.504
Tash.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.466
Hmm?

20:19.177 --> 20:21.095
'Cause he thought he could handle it all on his own.

20:23.263 --> 20:25.975
If you wasn't so fucking doggone stupid,

20:26.017 --> 20:27.560
your sister would still be alive.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.103
-Ghost!

20:29.145 --> 20:30.730
Come back here. I'm not finished with you.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.523
-Get here, get here. I said get here!

20:30.771 --> 20:32.523
-Ghost!

20:32.565 --> 20:34.358
Get here! Get up! Stand up!

20:34.400 --> 20:36.485
Ghost! Come on.

20:36.527 --> 20:37.737
Okay, all right, all right, all right.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.740
Go to your room. Look, please, okay?

20:40.781 --> 20:42.700
You said it, Ghost. All right?

20:42.742 --> 20:44.702
You can't do anything worse to him than that.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.748
Besides, this is not all his fault.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.583
That's true.

20:50.624 --> 20:53.086
You wasn't watching him, Tash.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.046
Are you fucking kidding me?

20:55.088 --> 20:57.173
You know what? Fine, go ahead.

20:57.215 --> 20:59.675
Blame everyone in this house for Raina's death.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.844
Including her, if you want to.

21:01.886 --> 21:05.973
But that still doesn't change the fact that Kanan is the

21:01.886 --> 21:05.973
reason Tariq is in this mess.

21:06.015 --> 21:09.185
I mean, you and Tommy just riding around with Kanan

21:06.015 --> 21:09.185
like this ain't his fault?

21:09.227 --> 21:11.229
Your son is fucked up because of Kanan.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.440
Our son almost died because of Dre.

21:21.072 --> 21:22.031
Ghost.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.331
Tameika, where's John Mak?

22:12.372 --> 22:14.917
I wanted to talk to him about the house bust

22:12.372 --> 22:14.917
in Suffolk County.

22:14.959 --> 22:18.171
He's over at the Bar Committee prepping for Joe Proctor's

22:14.959 --> 22:18.171
hearing.

22:18.212 --> 22:19.505
Why couldn't I reach you last night?

22:19.546 --> 22:21.799
That's why we issue you a phone.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.551
I was trying to reach you on a pressing matter

22:21.841 --> 22:24.551
and you didn't pick up.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.428
Where were you?

22:26.470 --> 22:30.557
I was home. I went to bed early.

22:30.599 --> 22:33.811
I'm so sorry, I didn't realize my, my ringer must have

22:30.599 --> 22:33.811
been off.

22:33.853 --> 22:38.565
Elevating you to this position helped assuage public concerns

22:33.853 --> 22:38.565
about DOJ corruption.

22:38.607 --> 22:39.859
Corruption you brought to light.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.153
Our moves now need to be beyond reproach.

22:42.195 --> 22:43.904
I need to make sure you aren't distracted.

22:43.946 --> 22:45.823
Not distracted, Tameika.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.908
Exhausted. I fell asleep.

22:47.950 --> 22:51.537
I'm completely present, totally focused.

22:54.372 --> 22:58.044
Tameika, what were you calling about?

22:54.372 --> 22:58.044
The pressing matter?

22:58.085 --> 22:59.170
I don't remember.

23:16.062 --> 23:19.565
I don't think Angela's being straight with me about where

23:16.062 --> 23:19.565
she was last night.

23:19.606 --> 23:23.027
In case you're right, keep Maria Suarez

23:19.606 --> 23:23.027
away from Angela

23:23.069 --> 23:24.528
until I tell you otherwise.

23:34.330 --> 23:37.499
Is it out of place to ask why the head of Criminal

23:34.330 --> 23:37.499
for the entire Eastern District

23:37.541 --> 23:39.960
of New York was at a lowly local murder scene?

23:40.002 --> 23:44.882
-Blanca Rodriguez,

23:40.002 --> 23:44.882
NYPD Internal Affairs.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.968
I'm working the Detective Raymond Jones case.

23:48.010 --> 23:51.180
I was called in because Jones was an undercover working

23:48.010 --> 23:51.180
narcotics,

23:51.222 --> 23:54.141
but his flop was filled with fenced items that

23:51.222 --> 23:54.141
he never reported,

23:54.183 --> 23:56.143
which is a big no-no.

23:56.185 --> 23:58.436
I saw you leaving Jones' flop last night.

23:58.478 --> 24:00.147
And I said to myself,

24:00.189 --> 24:04.026
"Self, it's not every day you see $400 stilettos

24:04.068 --> 24:07.196
at a potentially dirty undercover cop's

24:04.068 --> 24:07.196
bloody last known."

24:07.238 --> 24:09.698
So I looked at the sign out sheet and noticed you weren't

24:07.238 --> 24:09.698
on it.

24:09.740 --> 24:13.244
Little violation of NYPD protocol.

24:13.286 --> 24:14.745
It was an oversight.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.496
Why were you there?

24:16.538 --> 24:18.832
I'm just asking because maybe I'm missing something.

24:18.874 --> 24:22.169
You know, save me a couple steps in my investigation.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.630
Like you, I thought I'd check him out myself.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.048
See what kind of witness he would be.

24:26.090 --> 24:29.009
You ever spoken with Raymond Jones?

24:29.051 --> 24:31.137
Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance.

24:31.178 --> 24:34.514
He came onto my radar shortly before he went missing.

24:37.601 --> 24:40.562
I'm late for a meeting, so...

24:43.649 --> 24:45.567
Oh, hmm.

24:45.609 --> 24:46.986
Thank you for your time, Miss Valdes.

24:50.072 --> 24:50.990
Thank you.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.297
<i> The party you are</i> <i>trying to reach...</i>

25:06.339 --> 25:07.965
Damn it, Padre, where you at?

25:13.012 --> 25:15.055
-I know you.

25:17.391 --> 25:19.018
What you mean, did?

25:19.059 --> 25:22.062
He told me to find you if anything ever happened to him.

25:22.104 --> 25:24.231
What the fuck happened to him?

25:24.273 --> 25:27.525
-Look, somebody stabbed him up in the park last night.

25:24.273 --> 25:27.525
-Fuck.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.611
They found his body on a bench. He bled out from the heart.

25:29.653 --> 25:32.198
Oh...

25:35.909 --> 25:37.244
He's gone.

25:40.622 --> 25:43.834
-He was a good man. -Only good white guy

25:40.622 --> 25:43.834
I ever met.

25:44.626 --> 25:45.669
Me, too.

25:50.508 --> 25:52.343
You know who did it?

25:52.385 --> 25:54.428
I've been on the corner for Cal for three years.

25:54.470 --> 25:55.971
No idea who did him.

25:56.013 --> 25:57.639
I'd like to get my hands on that motherfucker.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.058
You and me both.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.684
I think it was a new connect.

26:02.144 --> 26:03.896
The new connect?

26:03.937 --> 26:08.275
Yeah, but look, the only thing is, I don't got a name.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.443
I don't need a name.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.570
Word?

26:12.612 --> 26:14.240
Just tell me everything you know.

26:17.284 --> 26:19.286
So, what the fuck is up with these Italian niggas?

26:19.328 --> 26:22.164
I never knew Tommy had no white friends.

26:22.206 --> 26:23.749
They're the wrong friends, K.

26:28.712 --> 26:31.006
Remember Tommy had that little African albino motherfucker

26:31.048 --> 26:33.591
he brought around back in the day?

26:33.633 --> 26:35.844
He thought he'd found another with boy like him in the hood.

26:38.055 --> 26:40.974
Remember the look on Tommy's face when Little Man

26:38.055 --> 26:40.974
kept calling us niggas?

26:43.269 --> 26:46.105
Yeah, he didn't know whether to join in or slap the fuck

26:43.269 --> 26:46.105
out the boy.

26:47.314 --> 26:50.192
-Oh, Tommy. -Yeah, man.

26:50.234 --> 26:52.361
Tommy's always looking for somebody to take care of him.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.322
Yeah, that was your job.

26:57.199 --> 26:59.785
Now that he's fucking with these Italians,

26:57.199 --> 26:59.785
you think they got his back?

27:01.412 --> 27:02.620
No, K, I don't.

27:06.542 --> 27:07.667
What you two talking about?

27:07.709 --> 27:09.836
You.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.130
Let's go.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.798
-Get in here, man. -Come on.

27:12.839 --> 27:15.259
Let's go get that motherfucker Dre.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.677
Come on, let's go.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.979
Sure this is the place, right, Tommy?

27:27.020 --> 27:29.315
Dre's in here somewhere.

27:27.020 --> 27:29.315
Just keep quiet.

27:46.957 --> 27:48.334
Hey, you see anything?

27:49.960 --> 27:52.212
No. You?

27:55.299 --> 27:56.634
Nothing.

28:13.817 --> 28:15.528
Here they come.

28:15.569 --> 28:17.029
Let's light them the fuck up.

28:20.658 --> 28:21.699
Tommy.

No, four seats, center ice. Right up against the glass.

You're lucky his little bitch ass can't shoot worth shit.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.671
Tommy.

29:57.713 --> 29:59.839
Sorry, I'm sorry.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.341
Good looking out back there, K.

30:01.383 --> 30:03.427
I got one with that motherfucker name on it.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.262
Nope, nope, la la la la la.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.013
I don't wanna hear anything about this, okay?

30:07.055 --> 30:09.516
I don't have a law license right now,

30:09.558 --> 30:14.020
which means I'm not a lawyer, which means there is no

30:09.558 --> 30:14.020
attorney-client privilege.

30:14.062 --> 30:17.524
So I don't wanna know where you were tonight

30:14.062 --> 30:17.524
or who did this to you,

30:17.566 --> 30:20.819
and I don't even know who the fuck this is,

30:17.566 --> 30:20.819
but you know what?

30:20.860 --> 30:22.946
I don't wanna know, okay?

30:22.988 --> 30:26.283
I'm supposed to stay away from you two until I get

30:22.988 --> 30:26.283
my law license back.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.201
So why'd you answer

30:26.325 --> 30:28.201
the phone?

30:30.120 --> 30:32.038
Huh?

30:32.080 --> 30:33.415
Look, because I could help.

30:35.584 --> 30:37.670
I am so sorry about your loss.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.473
I'll see you at the funeral, okay?

30:51.433 --> 30:53.310
'Cause you a member of this family now.

30:53.352 --> 30:56.104
And a family sticks together no matter what, right?

31:45.821 --> 31:47.947
Did you kill Dre?

31:47.989 --> 31:49.825
Good night, Tasha.

31:49.867 --> 31:53.912
I don't know how I'm going to forgive Tariq

31:53.953 --> 31:56.623
or any of us for what happened to Raina.

31:56.665 --> 31:58.208
But what I can tell you is that

31:58.250 --> 32:02.546
if you get killed chasing Dre, Ghost,

32:02.588 --> 32:06.800
and if you leave me with two kids that I will have to raise

32:02.588 --> 32:06.800
on my own,

32:06.842 --> 32:09.135
I will never forgive you.

32:10.970 --> 32:13.932
We'll all feel better once this is over.

32:10.970 --> 32:13.932
Once we get Dre.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.521
I will never feel better.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.692
Ever.

32:47.340 --> 32:51.386
I heard you have a bar hearing coming up.

32:51.428 --> 32:54.932
John Mak's got a hard on for getting me disbarred.

32:54.973 --> 32:59.478
He's gonna get the blue balls of his life when I walk out

32:54.973 --> 32:59.478
of there reinstated and clean.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.605
Why haven't you called me, Joe?

33:01.647 --> 33:04.357
I know you didn't break the law during the St. Patrick

33:01.647 --> 33:04.357
prosecution.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.234
I'd be your best witness.

33:06.276 --> 33:10.656
Yeah, while it's tempting to have the new Head of

33:06.276 --> 33:10.656
Criminal testify for me,

33:10.697 --> 33:12.616
you're not the best character witness.

33:12.658 --> 33:15.285
As one of the top federal prosecutors in the state?

33:15.327 --> 33:18.664
A job you blackmailed your way into, Angela.

33:15.327 --> 33:18.664
Come on.

33:18.705 --> 33:21.750
Everybody knows you told Tameika that you'd go into

33:18.705 --> 33:21.750
criminal defense

33:21.792 --> 33:25.587
and you'd kill any case they try across from you

33:21.792 --> 33:25.587
for the next 20 years.

33:26.254 --> 33:28.047
And?

33:28.089 --> 33:30.175
Why are you offering to help me?

33:30.216 --> 33:31.969
What, to burn John Mak?

33:32.010 --> 33:34.346
Do you want me to owe you something?

33:34.387 --> 33:37.850
'Cause that's the only thing I can imagine that would make

33:34.387 --> 33:37.850
you so invested

33:37.891 --> 33:39.434
in my welfare.

33:39.476 --> 33:42.688
You're innocent. I wanted to do the right thing.

33:43.438 --> 33:44.523
Why start now?

33:45.482 --> 33:46.775
I freed your client.

33:49.110 --> 33:52.781
Whatever game you're playing with John Mak,

33:49.110 --> 33:52.781
leave me the fuck out of it.

33:52.823 --> 33:54.700
Okay? I got enough of

33:52.823 --> 33:54.700
my own problems.

33:58.328 --> 33:59.371
Joe?

34:02.332 --> 34:06.461
If you had to do it all over again,

34:02.332 --> 34:06.461
would you still help Jamie?

34:08.881 --> 34:10.423
Probably.

34:10.465 --> 34:14.386
Yeah, no good deed goes unpunished, Angela.

34:14.427 --> 34:17.890
But this'll be behind me soon enough.

34:17.931 --> 34:21.518
Watch your back, Joe. Mak's not gonna go away easy.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.978
But hopefully you will.

34:30.527 --> 34:33.405
Reverend Macedon needs a list of pallbearers.

34:37.701 --> 34:41.914
Um, Ghost, and, uh, Tommy.

34:44.541 --> 34:49.212
My cousin Aaron, and, um, Mr. Lang,

34:44.541 --> 34:49.212
her drama teacher,

34:49.254 --> 34:50.296
he offered.

34:54.509 --> 34:55.802
When she was a baby

34:57.679 --> 34:59.890
she used to carry this everywhere.

35:01.474 --> 35:04.728
You remember when we left it at the McDonald's?

35:07.647 --> 35:11.526
Yeah, and we had to walk ten blocks in the rain

35:07.647 --> 35:11.526
to get it back.

35:13.987 --> 35:16.197
This should be in with her.

35:17.032 --> 35:18.075
Yeah.

35:26.416 --> 35:27.918
Hey, T.

35:29.962 --> 35:32.839
You remember what you asked me the other night

35:29.962 --> 35:32.839
about you and Tariq?

35:38.386 --> 35:40.388
If anybody asks me where y'all were,

35:44.434 --> 35:46.185
I'll say whatever you want.

35:50.482 --> 35:51.483
Thank you.

35:59.699 --> 36:03.870
Now that we know the location, all we need is a plan.

36:03.912 --> 36:06.372
Well, we blew the element of surprise over

36:03.912 --> 36:06.372
at the warehouse.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.792
No shit. Luring us there

36:06.414 --> 36:08.792
was a smart idea.

36:08.834 --> 36:09.918
It's what I would have done.

36:12.211 --> 36:15.465
Well, shit, we should just turn our mistake at the warehouse

36:12.211 --> 36:15.465
into an advantage for us.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.550
K, you still got your crew in town, right?

36:17.592 --> 36:20.095
-Phone call away. -Yo, yo. Wait, wait,

36:17.592 --> 36:20.095
hold up, hold up.

36:20.137 --> 36:22.472
-Yeah.

36:22.514 --> 36:26.726
So sending K's crew in there is playing right into

36:22.514 --> 36:26.726
Dre's hand.

36:26.768 --> 36:28.269
He's gonna be looking for black hitters.

36:28.311 --> 36:31.356
He ain't gonna be looking for white hitters.

36:31.397 --> 36:33.191
I know that you don't trust them, Ghost,

36:33.232 --> 36:34.943
but I think that we need to use the Italians.

36:34.985 --> 36:36.361
-Dre won't see them coming. -Bingo.

36:38.321 --> 36:39.656
We use them both.

36:49.041 --> 36:50.083
Have you done it?

36:51.793 --> 36:54.212
-Not yet. -What the fuck

36:51.793 --> 36:54.212
are you waiting for?

36:54.253 --> 36:58.091
There's an internal report and a federal database, Tasha.

36:58.133 --> 36:59.676
I checked the federal database.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.511
Your gun isn't logged in there yet.

37:01.553 --> 37:05.390
I can keep that from happening as just lost paperwork.

37:05.431 --> 37:08.852
But the internal report has already been filed.

37:08.894 --> 37:12.939
I have to log in as someone else and delete the file.

37:12.981 --> 37:16.275
-Okay. -Tasha, if I do this,

37:12.981 --> 37:16.275
it's obstruction of justice.

37:16.317 --> 37:18.570
It's evidence tampering. It's disbarment.

37:18.611 --> 37:20.780
Official misconduct, conspiracy,

37:20.822 --> 37:24.076
and that's before I'm an accessory to murder,

37:20.822 --> 37:24.076
before and after the fact.

37:24.117 --> 37:26.536
So don't get caught. Okay?

37:34.252 --> 37:36.880
Look, I'm trying to save everybody.

37:36.922 --> 37:39.465
If this wasn't a set

37:39.507 --> 37:41.384
-Because I knew you would help.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.178
Because you still love him.

37:43.220 --> 37:45.972
-Tasha, that's not true. -I don't care.

37:46.014 --> 37:48.767
The version of me that used to care,

37:48.808 --> 37:51.061
I don't even know that person anymore.

37:51.103 --> 37:53.563
She had three living kids,

37:53.605 --> 37:55.982
and she had time to worry about her husband

37:56.024 --> 37:58.151
sleeping with another woman.

37:58.193 --> 38:01.279
Look, you still love him, and you still owe me.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.073
You ripped my family apart

38:03.115 --> 38:06.076
the first time you took him and then the second time.

38:06.118 --> 38:10.288
And don't think just because you gave him back

38:06.118 --> 38:10.288
it evens the score.

38:10.329 --> 38:13.083
Tasha, I'm very sorry about Raina.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.919
And for what's happened to Tariq.

38:15.961 --> 38:20.298
If I do this, I'm doing it for them.

38:22.259 --> 38:24.970
You'll be doing it for yourself.

38:33.686 --> 38:36.148
Sammy, can't wait to meet the rest of the guys.

38:36.189 --> 38:37.983
Thanks for setting this thing up for me.

38:38.024 --> 38:40.526
This is what your pops wants. I got it.

38:40.568 --> 38:43.655
Back in the day, Teresi and I were the most

38:40.568 --> 38:43.655
vicious hitters in New York.

38:43.696 --> 38:45.031
We'd get anybody.

38:45.073 --> 38:46.992
Who holds that title now?

38:47.033 --> 38:48.868
There's a four-man crew that's hard to beat.

38:48.910 --> 38:51.121
They're kids, but that just means they don't give a fuck.

38:51.163 --> 38:53.456
That's two of them back there, Carmine and Marco.

38:53.498 --> 38:55.083
Stay away from them. They'll corrupt you.

39:02.048 --> 39:05.927
Vincent, this here's Teresi's kid, Tommy.

39:05.969 --> 39:08.972
-Tommy Teresi in the flesh. -Nice to meet you, man.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.932
Thank you for seeing me.

39:10.974 --> 39:13.476
Yeah, no problem at all. Sammy's been telling

39:10.974 --> 39:13.476
me about you.

39:13.518 --> 39:16.395
Take a seat. Dave, I need more

39:13.518 --> 39:16.395
ginger in this.

39:16.437 --> 39:17.772
Tastes like shit.

39:17.814 --> 39:20.399
Look, Vincent, I won't waste your time.

39:20.441 --> 39:23.528
I'm ready to cut you in on a deal that'll

39:20.441 --> 39:23.528
change your life.

39:23.569 --> 39:25.197
You got a lot of balls.

39:26.739 --> 39:30.451
Tell me about this opportunity that's gonna change my life.

39:30.493 --> 39:33.663
Yo, I got a boatload of some quality product coming in.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.874
If you use your guys to move my weight

39:35.915 --> 39:38.668
and I am one loyal motherfucker,

39:38.710 --> 39:40.753
I'm gonna make you so much money.

39:40.795 --> 39:42.588
I heard you were a dope man.

39:44.257 --> 39:47.802
And you want me to move your weight?

39:47.844 --> 39:49.054
Why?

39:49.095 --> 39:50.972
Where's your crew?

39:51.014 --> 39:52.724
I had to let them go.

39:52.765 --> 39:55.685
I had one bad one in the bunch, and he spoiled them all.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.027
I'm gonna help you out.

40:04.069 --> 40:06.238
Because you're Teresi's kid.

40:06.279 --> 40:08.865
Your father's been good to the family,

40:06.279 --> 40:08.865
so I'm gonna be good to you.

40:13.245 --> 40:16.706
I'll take 75% of what you got off your hands.

40:16.748 --> 40:19.751
Vincent, you will not regret making that move.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.419
I promise you.

40:23.588 --> 40:27.008
-All right. -Come, use the back door.

40:27.050 --> 40:28.093
Oh, oh, yeah.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.518
You vouch for him?

40:37.560 --> 40:38.561
I do.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.899
There you go.

40:52.450 --> 40:56.288
Yo, yo, yo, fellas, let me holla at you a second.

40:56.329 --> 40:58.873
Word on the street is you the baddest motherfuckers

40:56.329 --> 40:58.873
in town.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.419
I'm Tommy. Tony Teresi's kid.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.920
I heard a rumor Teresi had a son.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.964
I heard you'd be coming around.

41:06.005 --> 41:08.967
Yeah, well, here I am. Y'all looking for some

41:06.005 --> 41:08.967
extra employment?

41:09.008 --> 41:10.718
Everything we do goes through Vincent.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.262
Everything

41:12.304 --> 41:13.763
What's he, your fucking parole officer?

41:13.805 --> 41:15.181
Ain't you got no sense of adventure?

41:16.557 --> 41:18.226
I'll give you 60k for one hit.

41:26.025 --> 41:28.027
Make it 80k, you got a deal.

41:28.069 --> 41:31.448
80k. All right.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.491
I don't even need you to merc the dude.

41:33.532 --> 41:35.618
Just grab him and bring him to me.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.412
I wanna be the one that pulls that trigger.

41:38.579 --> 41:40.457
I'll be in touch.

41:45.920 --> 41:49.424
I noticed the hinges on your door were busted recently.

41:50.300 --> 41:52.010
What's that about?

41:52.051 --> 41:55.430
It's the projects. They just come like that.

41:55.472 --> 41:57.265
So, what's gonna happen next?

41:57.307 --> 41:59.225
I finished my investigation into your cousin.

41:59.267 --> 42:01.811
A death certificate gets granted eventually,

42:01.853 --> 42:05.148
and you as next of kin collect whatever pension he receives.

42:05.190 --> 42:06.858
Unless he was dirty, of course.

42:09.735 --> 42:11.237
A death certificate?

42:13.656 --> 42:16.659
Uh, to tell you the truth, sweetie,

42:16.701 --> 42:19.454
it's not looking good that he'll ever be found.

42:34.552 --> 42:38.139
Has anyone else come to speak with you about your cousin?

42:38.181 --> 42:42.101
Just some of his coworkers. NYPD.

42:42.143 --> 42:43.478

Tasha, I think I know what happened the other night,

51:12.028 --> 51:14.864
before you came to see me.

51:14.906 --> 51:16.741
I think that you're protecting someone.

51:16.782 --> 51:19.159
-Terry, I really can't... -You don't...

51:19.201 --> 51:21.370
I was watching him in the church.

51:25.708 --> 51:27.626
James asked you

51:27.668 --> 51:30.128

I will protect you instead.

Tasha, what do you think you're doing?

52:05.581 --> 52:08.667
Mama, you wouldn't understand.

52:08.709 --> 52:11.420
You're right. I don't.
