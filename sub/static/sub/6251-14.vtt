it might help Neal
to have the tail removed.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.713

lining is both thickened

11:31.483 --> 11:33.565
[Man ]
Neal disappeared
the night before last.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.356
He didn’t show up
for his morning meds.
[ Woman Shouting]

11:36.446 --> 11:38.903
So, you thought perhaps
he bolted that night?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.943
Yes.
He’s escaped before?

11:41.034 --> 11:43.992
Escape implies incarceration.
We prefer the term AWOL.

11:44.079 --> 11:46.445
The man was committed
to your insane asylum...

11:46.540 --> 11:48.701
because he believed
he was the mythical
embodiment of evil.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.373
Escape seems accurate.

11:50.460 --> 11:54.044
Neal was genius at finding
nooks and crannies where
he’d hole up for days.

11:54.131 --> 11:57.168
We were hoping he’d
done that again, that he’d
show up when he got hungry.

11:57.259 --> 12:00.342
Well, we’d like to ask
your patients and staff
if they know anything.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.381
Oh.
[ Booth]
Oh.

12:02.514 --> 12:06.928
Is that a problem?
Staff— I’m good with that.
Patients?

12:07.019 --> 12:10.978
These are damaged people,
Agent Booth. Their hold
on reality is tenuous.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.100
Well, that’s why we brought
our own psychologist.

12:13.191 --> 12:15.682
- You’re Dr. Sweets?
- Mm-hmm.

12:15.777 --> 12:18.029
You sounded more experienced
on the phone.

12:18.113 --> 12:19.944
[ Laughing]

12:20.032 --> 12:21.738
- He means you sounded older.
- I know.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.816
[Laughmg]
Loveit

12:23.952 --> 12:26.238
It’s not that funny, Booth.
I think it is.

12:26.330 --> 12:27.661
[ Mutters ]

12:27.748 --> 12:30.364
This is the arts
and crafts area.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.663
Well, the work
is quite—
[Copeland ] Disturbing?

12:33.795 --> 12:36.832
[Brennan ]
Fascinating.
[Booth] Yeah, fascinating.

12:36.924 --> 12:39.085
So, did, uh, Neal Lowery
have any enemies here?

12:39.176 --> 12:41.542
Seems the whole presence
of the devil, the tails...

12:41.637 --> 12:44.003
and the horns—
that must have been
quite disrupting.

12:44.097 --> 12:47.214
Actually, schizophrenic
hallucinations can be
way worse than that.

12:47.309 --> 12:51.302
Way, way worse.
Yes, one boy with horns
would barely register.

12:51.396 --> 12:54.684
Well, why didn’t you just
have the horns removed
as part of the cure?

12:54.775 --> 12:58.313
I thought this would be
a significant and visible
breakthrough for Neal...

12:58.403 --> 13:00.394
if he made the decision
without being forced.

13:00.489 --> 13:02.480
Oh. What do you think,
Sweets?

13:02.574 --> 13:04.906
- Oh, I buy it.
- Thank you, Dr. Sweets.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.824
Yeah.

13:06.912 --> 13:10.621
You don’t think Neal was killed
on the grounds here, do you?
That would not be good.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.244
I’m quite certain
it wouldn’t make
any difference to Neal.

13:13.335 --> 13:16.748
Neal— did he have any, um—
I don’t know—

13:16.838 --> 13:19.545
fights with, uh, fellow...

13:20.884 --> 13:23.250
people?
Uh, physically, no.

13:23.345 --> 13:26.587
- Arguments?
- A case of competing
delusions, yes,

13:26.682 --> 13:30.095
that deteriorated into
shouting upon occasion,
but nothing more.

13:30.185 --> 13:34.053
Neviah, these people have
some questions for you
about Neal Lowery.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.559
Do you feel up to
speaking with them?

13:40.237 --> 13:42.353
God warned me you’d be
here with questions.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.108
God warns you?

13:44.199 --> 13:46.110
Of course.

13:46.201 --> 13:48.988
How else would I have known
to have this ready for you?

13:51.331 --> 13:54.869
Oh. Okay. Wow.
That’s, uh—

13:54.960 --> 13:58.418
- I’m gonna need another
word for fascinating.
- “Creepy”?

14:00.132 --> 14:02.168
So, what are we to learn
from this, Neviah?

14:02.259 --> 14:05.877
You are very— Um,
you’re talented. You’re—

14:05.971 --> 14:08.838
[Brennan ] 0b vious/y, she is replaced

14:08.932 --> 14:13.301
the soldier who drove his spear
through Christ’s side during the
crucifixion— with her own face.

14:13.395 --> 14:17.729
Neviah believes herself to be
the earthly manifestation
of the angel Uriel.

14:19.151 --> 14:22.314
She’s put the murder victim’s
face in place of...

14:22.404 --> 14:24.315
the crucified devil

14:24.406 --> 14:26.442
Are you confessing to murder?

14:26.533 --> 14:29.195
You mind if/ conduct
the, uh, conversation,
Dr. Brennan?

14:29.286 --> 14:32.369
No. No.
But you might want to know
that the placement...

14:32.456 --> 14:34.617
of the lance here
in the victim’s side...

14:34.708 --> 14:39.122

where the vict/m was struck
in real life.

- Oh.
- So, this is true?

14:42.174 --> 14:46.964
| only tell the truth.
As Dr. Copeland told you,

14:48.055 --> 14:49.465
I’m an angel.

14:58.315 --> 15:01.773
/ just don ’t think it’s wise
to have Dr. Brennan present
when we question Ne viah.

15:01.860 --> 15:05.068
Well, why?
What if Neviah told you
that she’s an angel?

15:05.155 --> 15:08.147
Something she believes
with her whole heart.
How would you respond?

15:08.241 --> 15:11.074
Well, I’d tell her that angels
don’t exist, except, of course,

15:11.161 --> 15:14.949

such as the Bible
and in children’s books.

all we 7/ get from Ne I/iah
is argument, no answers.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.659
Sweets is right.
Bones, you’re out.

15:23.465 --> 15:26.081
l have to admit, it’s eerie
the way when I move,

15:26.176 --> 15:28.758
she follows me as though
she knows exactly where I am.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.881
That’s because she can see you.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.258
It’s a window, Bones.
It’s not a two-way mirror.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.682
Oh.
Right.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.353
Perhaps I could wait in some
other part of your facility?

15:40.482 --> 15:44.225
Yes, certainly.
This isn’t really
a good use of my time.

15:44.319 --> 15:46.935
Thank you.
Neviah, could you
describe to me...

15:47.030 --> 15:49.191
the process by which
you create your paintings?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.273
God guides my hand.

15:51.368 --> 15:55.702
I would imagine that God guides
all of your actions, right?
You being an angel.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.916
Did you know that
Neal Lowery is dead?

16:02.003 --> 16:04.585
Of course.
God told me.

16:04.673 --> 16:06.504

Uh, does he come to you in visions?

He takes over my body
and performs his miracles
through me.

Did you kill Neal?

16:14.766 --> 16:18.429

- And where is this lance now?
- It’s right here.

- Right. It’s gonna be hard
getting fingerprints off that.

reuptake inhibitor?

but I just ate.

Hi. I’m Dr. Phillip Womack.

16:57.309 --> 17:00.267
I’m Dr. Temperance Brennan.
Temperance would be fine.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.014
Beautiful name.

17:02.105 --> 17:04.187
Unfortunately,
most of the patients here
don’t exhibit much temperance,

17:04.274 --> 17:06.185
hence the need to
fill them with drugs.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.312
Well, I would probably
medicate as well...

17:08.403 --> 17:11.361
if I was forced to interact
with psychiatrists all day.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.400
No offense.
Well, none taken.

17:13.491 --> 17:17.609
Ours is a subjective profession
that often marginalizes the
importance of empirical data.

17:17.704 --> 17:22.038
It is refreshing to meet
a psychiatrist with such
a grounded perspective.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.366
Hmm.
But I assure you...

17:24.461 --> 17:27.203
we have been getting
very good results
with psychopharmacology...

17:27.297 --> 17:29.208
as well as
electroconvulsive therapy.

17:29.299 --> 17:31.039

- Who knows? I may be able...

the wonders of psychiatry.

Dr. Brennan.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.053
Yes.
Where were
you two going?

17:41.144 --> 17:43.430
Oh, Dr. Womack was going
to show me around.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.432
I don’t know if now
is the time, Phillip.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.479
Lloyd is distributing
medication.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.432
Yes, of course.
I should assist.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.652
Perhaps later, Temperance?
I’d like that.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.609
Did Phillip try to cure you
of anything?

17:59.746 --> 18:02.328
[Brennan ]
He ’3 a patient.
For almost six years now

18:02.415 --> 18:06.374
Believe it or not, he came
a long way before plateauing
with this delusion.

18:06.461 --> 18:09.373
I thought we had quite
a lot in common.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.588
Hey, Lloyd.
That’s right.

18:30.318 --> 18:34.436
Did you find cause of death?
Looks like the victim was
struck in the frontal bone...

18:34.531 --> 18:36.738
by a weapon approxin7ate/y
two cent/meters in diameter.

18:36.825 --> 18:39.658
Possibly the same object
that struck him in the ribs.

18:39.744 --> 18:43.487
Okay. So we’ve got a fracture
to the forehead.

18:43.581 --> 18:46.414
And a Colles’ fracture
on the right distal radius.

18:46.501 --> 18:49.163
All delivered by an invisible
heavenly lance.

18:49.254 --> 18:52.746
If it was invisible,
it struck with
a mighty force.

18:52.841 --> 18:56.379
What if despite her insanity,
what the young woman saw
was in fact evil?

18:56.469 --> 18:59.632
- So you do believe in the devil.
- As I said.

18:59.723 --> 19:02.135
No, you told me
what your religion says.

19:02.225 --> 19:04.887
I know Shaitan to be real.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.344
I’ve been in his presence.

19:07.439 --> 19:10.181
I look into his eyes
every day.

19:14.195 --> 19:17.028
I should put my efforts
towards identifying the weapon.

19:17.115 --> 19:20.607
Yes. That would be good.

19:32.005 --> 19:36.044

an insight into the unconscious.

Yeah. No, I know the drill.
| assisted an art therapist
in college.

19:40.472 --> 19:43.839
You can take one look
at van Gogh’s Starry Night—

19:43.933 --> 19:47.061
the dark blues
and the violent brushstrokes.

19:47.145 --> 19:50.182
It’s no wonder he killed himself
after painting it.

19:50.273 --> 19:53.436
But Neviah’s work
seems conflicted.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.484
The central image is straight
out of Hieronymus Bosch.

19:56.571 --> 20:00.985
The background is full
of warm and vibrant colors.

20:01.076 --> 20:02.941
And her brushstrokes
are calm.

20:03.036 --> 20:06.403
There is no turm0/l
or rage in her work.

20:06.498 --> 20:09.331
It could indicate a cold,
measured person...

20:09.417 --> 20:13.160
disconnected from
an emotional life that’s
too painful to confront.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.412
Hold on.
Hmm.

20:15.507 --> 20:17.463
This is weird.

20:19.636 --> 20:23.424
The topography of the paint
is unusually thick right here.

20:23.515 --> 20:26.507
This could mean
that there’s something
underneath the image.

20:26.601 --> 20:29.684
Sometimes when an artist
bowdlerizes their own work,

20:29.771 --> 20:33.309
infrared refractography
can show us what’s under
that top coat of paint.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.607
Oh. Wow.

20:39.030 --> 20:42.443
That’s, uh— That’s one of
the nurses from the hospital.

He’s a demon.
Who has just killed the devil.

I don’t think you need Jung
to figure this one out.

this as evidence, are you?

with Neal Lowery?

- Look, I’d like to go home.
- No, no, no.
You mind popping your trunk?

21:21.739 --> 21:26.199
What? No. Not unless
you have a search warrant,
which I’m guessing you don’t.

21:26.286 --> 21:28.368
Really?
Look at this here.
Excuse me, Bones.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.616
See? “All visitors
and employees agree...

21:30.707 --> 21:33.574

upon entry and exit. ”

going down that route.

the dorky martial arts stuff?

Nunchakus and shuriken
aren’t dorky, all right?

22:41.528 --> 22:43.519
They’re weapons
of a true master.

22:43.613 --> 22:46.696
You see, the fact that you
just called it “shuriken”
proves my “dorky” theory.

22:46.783 --> 22:50.947
So, drugs—
did you steal them
from the hospital pharmacy?

22:51.037 --> 22:53.744
No. How do you know
I didn’t buy them from
someone else who stole them?

22:53.831 --> 22:58.541
Okay, look.

really a good guy.

22:58.670 --> 23:00.626
I am.
Yeah.

Neal’s medications didn’t work.

23:08.638 --> 23:11.220
All right? I mean, the tranqs
and the antipsychotics—

23:11.307 --> 23:14.049
they turned him into a zombie,
but they didn’t make him
feel any better.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.225
But, uh, this did?

23:16.312 --> 23:19.520
Yeah. I mean, heroin
removed his agitation.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.768
For the first time,
you could talk to the guy.

23:21.859 --> 23:23.895
Mmm. How did Neal
pay for the heroin?

23:24.028 --> 23:26.861
I took his meds in exchange.
For your own use?

23:26.948 --> 23:30.736
No. No. l-l volunteer
at a community outreach
for the homeless.

23:30.827 --> 23:32.783
A lot of those people
need meds.

23:35.331 --> 23:38.164
You see?
You really are a good guy.

23:38.251 --> 23:39.957
Yeah, lam. lam a good guy.

23:40.044 --> 23:44.413
You are a good guy.
The only problem is that,
uh, these nunchakus—

23:44.507 --> 23:48.091
[ Clears Throat]
They could probably be
the murder weapon.

23:48.177 --> 23:50.008
Why would I kill Neal?

23:50.096 --> 23:52.087
It doesn’t matter
if you’re a good guy.
You’re a drug dealer.

23:52.181 --> 23:55.139
- Drug dealers— they get into
arguments with other clients.
- No, no, l was helping him.

23:56.185 --> 23:58.141
When was the last time
you saw him?

23:59.272 --> 24:01.137
Uh, in the dayroom.

24:01.274 --> 24:04.391
We talked, and then later
that evening his brother came
looking for him, but he was gone.

24:04.485 --> 24:07.943
Mm-hmm. I’m still holding you
on controlled substances.

24:08.072 --> 24:11.405
You believe I didn’t
kill Neal, right?
Doesn’t matter what I believe.

24:11.492 --> 24:13.483
Matters what I can prove.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.578
Anything
on the nunchakus?

24:17.665 --> 24:19.951
Mmm, they are
completely clean.

24:20.043 --> 24:22.534
There are dents, though,
so they’ve been used.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.540
Can you rule them out
as the murder weapon?

24:24.631 --> 24:27.338
Are you asking me
to do an experiment?

24:27.425 --> 24:29.381
With Arastoo.

24:29.469 --> 24:31.380
Why are you saying
his name like that?

24:31.471 --> 24:32.586
Like what?

24:32.680 --> 24:36.047
‘i4rastoo. ”
Like you’re chewing on his name.

24:38.102 --> 24:40.434
Arastoo said that he looks
at the devil every day.

24:40.563 --> 24:43.726
Maybe he has low self-esteem.
Or—

24:44.942 --> 24:47.604
You know what they
call us, right?
“They” being?

24:47.695 --> 24:51.313
Muslims. Some Muslims—
the ones over there
trying to kill us.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.819
Yeah, they call us
“the Great Satan.”

24:53.910 --> 24:56.071
Oh.

24:58.039 --> 25:00.621
Look— here. What I found.

25:04.921 --> 25:08.459
Radiating microfractures
in the cartilage of the
victim’s vestigial tail.

25:08.549 --> 25:11.677
Radiating microfractures
plus a ruptured intestine?

25:11.803 --> 25:14.385
What does that mean?
He was slammed
into something.

25:14.472 --> 25:18.590
Perhaps in fact he did wrestle
with an archangel and lose.

25:22.939 --> 25:25.396
As it should be.
The devil lost,
as he always must.

25:25.483 --> 25:27.815
I will inform Dr. Brennan.

25:31.322 --> 25:34.314
- “The devil lost”?
- “As he always must”?

25:34.409 --> 25:35.865
What if Arastoo means us?

25:35.952 --> 25:40.571
Arastoo is a very sweet,
gentle guy, you know?

25:40.665 --> 25:43.873
I know, but that doesn’t mean
that in his heart he doesn’t
look down on us.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.916
Do you wanna work
with someone who thinks
you’re the Great Satan?

25:46.003 --> 25:48.085
No, I don’t want
to be the Great Satan.

25:48.172 --> 25:51.790
I don’t even want
to be a minor demon.
Want me to talk to him?

25:51.884 --> 25:57.675
Yes. But, unfortunately,
dopey interpersonal crap
falls under my job description.

26:00.601 --> 26:04.435
The discrepancies from
the pharmacy have always been
so small, well within breakage.

26:04.564 --> 26:07.055
[ Sweets ] We understand.
Understand?
Why do we understand?

26:07.150 --> 26:09.687
Well, Lloyd Robertson
was a nurse practitioner.

26:09.777 --> 26:13.361
He had pharmacy privileges,
right? He cooked the drug log.

26:13.448 --> 26:15.439
Patients liked Lloyd,
the staff.

26:15.533 --> 26:18.821
He honestly wanted to help
people— or at least fooled me
into thinking that was the case.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.448
Well, so much for penetrating
psychological insights.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.497
Can I speak to you
for a moment?

26:29.255 --> 26:32.543
I’ve listened to you take
shots at my profession,
and that’s okay.

26:32.633 --> 26:36.251
I’m a big boy, a tolerant man.
But I want you to think
about something.

26:36.345 --> 26:41.590
I spend every working hour
of every day trying to help
people who are living in hell.

26:41.684 --> 26:43.845
That’s an honorable way
to spend a life.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.052
Perhaps more honorable
than figuring out...

26:46.147 --> 26:49.355
what happened to dead people
who are already beyond
pain and suffering.

26:51.027 --> 26:56.192
Intentions,
however misguided, do count.
I understand that.

26:56.282 --> 27:01.072
I hope you won’t think I’m too
picky when I point out that
that wasn’t an actual apology.

27:02.622 --> 27:06.285
But perhaps it’s the best
you can manage.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.036
[Booth ]
Ah, look at that.
You’re shaking hands.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.334
Great. Everyone’s made up
and we’re friends now. Great.

27:10.421 --> 27:12.753
- No!
- [ Woman Screams]

27:12.840 --> 27:16.549
No! Just—
Oh! Just get away!
Get away!

27:16.677 --> 27:18.668
Hold his right side down!
Go right!

27:18.805 --> 27:20.887
[Groaning ]
Do you hear me?

27:20.973 --> 27:23.464
Just relax and let
the medicine help.

27:23.559 --> 27:26.016
It’s not the right medicine!
I need the right medicine!

27:26.103 --> 27:27.479
What’s the right
medicine, Phillip?

27:27.563 --> 27:29.474
I want the medicine
Lloyd gave me.
Where is Lloyd?

27:29.565 --> 27:31.817
I need the special medicine.
I’m a doctor.

27:31.901 --> 27:35.064
- Lloyd gave you special medicine?
- I’m a doctor.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.566
I’m a doctor.

27:38.825 --> 27:41.407
[ Woman ]
Stop! Stop poking him!

27:41.494 --> 27:43.405
I’m gonna need
to search this facility.

27:43.496 --> 27:46.078
/ apologize, Dr. Cope/and

27:46.165 --> 27:48.747
I apologize for
undervaluing your work.

27:48.835 --> 27:53.078
[Man ]
Very sad now!
He’s gonna be sad now!

27:56.175 --> 27:58.086
Test number one.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.757
Now, I’ve placed sensors
in this dummy...

28:01.848 --> 28:05.215
to register the impact
of the nunchaku strikes.

28:06.602 --> 28:09.184
[ Beeping ]

28:09.272 --> 28:11.433
[Sighs]

28:17.613 --> 28:20.730
Ha! Hyah!

28:20.825 --> 28:24.238
Dr. Hodgins, with nunchakus,
it’s very important that you—

28:24.328 --> 28:26.193
Ooh!

28:26.330 --> 28:29.197
[ Groaning]
Are you all right?

28:29.292 --> 28:32.284
Son of a bitch!
[ Groans ]

28:32.378 --> 28:34.334
As I was saying, nunchakus
are deceptively difficult...

28:34.422 --> 28:36.287
to maneuver if you’ve
had no practice.

28:36.424 --> 28:39.962
[Groaning]
Um, may I?

28:40.052 --> 28:43.419
[ Groans ]
No—

28:44.473 --> 28:48.057
Okay. [Sighs]
Knock yourself out.

28:48.144 --> 28:49.600
I did.

28:49.687 --> 28:51.678
Oh!

29:06.537 --> 29:10.405
What are you,
some kind of Persian ninja?

29:10.499 --> 29:12.990
[ Groaning ]

29:15.880 --> 29:18.622
[Groaning Continues]

29:22.970 --> 29:26.337
- [ Beeping ]
- That can’t be right.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.301
Was this
the murder weapon?
Uh—

29:32.396 --> 29:35.103
The diameter of the weapon
matches, but, see—

29:35.191 --> 29:37.523
Okay. Nunchakus swing on an axis
because of the chain.

29:37.610 --> 29:40.647
Right? Which means the force
increases exponentially...

29:40.738 --> 29:42.854
along the length
of the striking surface.

29:42.949 --> 29:45.941
But the victim’s wound
was proportional along
the length of the weapon.

29:46.035 --> 29:51.246
If Lloyd the drug-dealing nurse
killed Neal the demonic
schizophrenic,

29:51.332 --> 29:53.573
then this was not the weapon.

29:55.044 --> 29:56.375
[Thuds To Ground]

29:59.256 --> 30:02.840
So, how long have you been
practicing psychiatry,
Dr. Womack?

30:02.969 --> 30:05.085
Longer than you have,
Dr. Sweets.
[ Chuckles ]

30:05.179 --> 30:10.048
Yes, my youth has often
been an obstacle to gaining
trust with patients.

30:10.142 --> 30:13.225
That’s why I often pretend
to be one of them.

30:13.312 --> 30:18.272
Oh, that’s interesting.
Okay, so in order to gain trust
from the patients at the ward,

30:18.359 --> 30:20.771
you pretend to be
mentally ill yourself?

30:20.861 --> 30:23.694
I’m a natural actor.
It helped Lloyd cooperated...

30:23.781 --> 30:26.739
and treated me
like I was a patient instead
of his immediate superior.

30:26.826 --> 30:29.488
What about Dr. Copeland?

30:29.578 --> 30:31.489
Ethan is a very fine
psychiatrist,

30:31.580 --> 30:36.040
but he’s very conservative
when it comes to the distinction
between doctor and patient.

30:36.127 --> 30:37.617
A traditionalist?

30:37.712 --> 30:41.045
Yes, exactly, Dr. Sweets.
Exactly.

30:41.132 --> 30:45.501
I’m sorry, Ethan, but this
is an official investigation,
and I must be honest.

30:45.594 --> 30:50.133
So, you and Lloyd Robertson
treated Neal Lowery together?

30:50.224 --> 30:52.340
Only with regard to medication.

30:52.435 --> 30:56.223
Neal and I shared a few
secrets I did not divulge—
patient confidentiality.

30:57.398 --> 31:00.561
I don’t suppose
you’d tell me what?

31:00.651 --> 31:02.562
No, I couldn’t possibly.

31:02.653 --> 31:05.895
I breached patient
confidentiality once,
and I still feel bad about it.

31:05.990 --> 31:09.482
Hmm. Was this regarding
Neal Lowery or—

31:09.577 --> 31:12.489
I’m sorry, Dr. Sweets,
l have nothing whatsoever
to say on the matter.

31:12.580 --> 31:15.492
It’s closed.
I’ll ask that you extend me
that professional courtesy.

31:15.583 --> 31:17.949
Sure.

31:26.844 --> 31:29.460
- You found something?
- Yes. Cause of death.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.386
Excellent. What happened?

31:31.474 --> 31:34.261
First, I’d like
to clarify something.

31:34.351 --> 31:36.387
After we talked
about my beliefs,
you were clearly upset.

31:36.479 --> 31:38.435
What? No, that’s not true.

31:38.522 --> 31:44.142
My words could have been
construed as a Muslim referring
to America as the Great Satan.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.522
I’m not familiar
with that phrase.

31:46.614 --> 31:49.401
Could we get back to this?

31:49.492 --> 31:52.609
I found microfractures
in the metacarpals...

31:52.703 --> 31:56.992
on the same arm
with the Colles’ fracture.

31:59.043 --> 32:00.999
I love this country,
Dr. Saroyan.

32:01.087 --> 32:04.671
When I said I see
the devil’s face daily—

32:06.342 --> 32:08.549
You know I served
as a translator in Iraq.

32:10.721 --> 32:13.383
Normal day, milk run
to an outlying village
to talk about water,

32:13.516 --> 32:16.849
and an LED.
took out our Humvee.
Oh, my God.

32:16.936 --> 32:21.430
Two dead, three wounded,
and l was the only one
left conscious.

32:21.524 --> 32:24.266
I’m a translator.
I use words.

32:24.360 --> 32:29.730
But coming towards us
with an AK-47—
an insurgent.

32:29.824 --> 32:32.531
He raised it, intending
to finish us off.

32:32.660 --> 32:35.618
And that was the devil?
No, no.

32:35.704 --> 32:38.116
I shot this man
in the heart.

32:38.207 --> 32:41.699
The devil, that evil—

32:41.794 --> 32:46.083
I saw it in his eyes, sure,
but it was in me, too,
when I pulled that trigger.

32:46.173 --> 32:48.755
You were defending
your unit, Mr. Vaziri.

32:48.843 --> 32:51.880
This man
lay dead at my feet.

32:51.971 --> 32:54.383
I searched his body
for identification...

32:54.473 --> 32:57.965
and I found a photograph
of him with his little boy,

32:58.060 --> 33:01.473
his wife laughing.

33:01.564 --> 33:04.226
A family.

33:04.316 --> 33:07.058
Tell me that the devil
did not win on that day.

33:10.156 --> 33:13.398
You didn’t lose your faith.
You pray five times a day.

33:13.492 --> 33:16.780
l have to believe that Allah
will show me how to live.

33:19.123 --> 33:23.617
I found microfractures
on the maxillary
and mandibular.

33:25.838 --> 33:28.796
He was electrocuted?
The current must have
passed through his hand,

33:28.883 --> 33:31.090
traveled across his body
then out his backside.

33:31.177 --> 33:34.635
It was the muscle spasms
that caused his intestines
to rupture.

33:34.722 --> 33:37.680
I should let Dr. Brennan
know right away.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.722
Of course.

33:42.062 --> 33:44.849
I did... think that—

33:44.940 --> 33:49.775
wonder if you considered us
to be the Great Satan.

33:49.862 --> 33:52.604
- I am familiar with that phrase.
- I know.

33:52.698 --> 33:55.440
l was there when you told
Dr. Hodgins that his T-shirt...

33:55.534 --> 33:58.901
which read
“I am with the Great Satan”...

33:58.996 --> 34:01.282
is not suitable work attire.

34:10.633 --> 34:13.716
Was Neal Lowery
receiving shock therapy?

34:13.802 --> 34:14.791
No. Why?

34:14.887 --> 34:17.720
Neal Lowery died
from being electrocuted.

34:17.806 --> 34:22.470
Well, E.C.T. equipment generates
a maximum 225 volts, and there’s
a fail-safe mechanism.

34:22.561 --> 34:28.272
Our analysis indicates that
Neal Lowery endured an extended
shock of at least 480 volts.

34:28.359 --> 34:32.477
is there anywhere
in this complex where 480 volts
m/ght be generated?

34:32.571 --> 34:36.029
I think it would be best
if we get an electrical engineer
to answer that.

34:36.116 --> 34:39.608
- There’s a guy in Ward 4 who
believes he’s Thomas Edison.
- [ Chuckles ]

34:39.703 --> 34:42.035
Sorry.

34:42.122 --> 34:44.374
These are the electrical plans
for the retrofit...

34:44.458 --> 34:46.824
that was completed
at Havenhurst 15 years ago.

34:46.919 --> 34:48.830
All the wiring
and breakers—

34:48.921 --> 34:51.082
there’s nothing more
than 225 volts.

34:51.173 --> 34:55.257
Now, I’m scanning
the original plans,
and they’re from 1908.

34:56.345 --> 34:58.301
Okay.

34:58.389 --> 35:01.426
So, on the original blueprint,
there was a four-wire,

35:01.517 --> 35:04.133
600-volt transformer
in the basement.

35:04.270 --> 35:08.934
The southwest corner of the basement
where the old generator is installed
was sealed off.

35:09.024 --> 35:12.061
Except for these
all-access panels.

35:12.152 --> 35:14.359
Yeah, but they’d need those
in case of a fire.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.357
Dr. Copeland said that
Neal Lowery had a knack...

35:16.448 --> 35:18.905
for searching out nooks
and crannies to hide out in.

35:20.744 --> 35:24.362
Okay, the access panel
should be down this
corridor to the left.

35:26.667 --> 35:28.749
Ah, you got to be
kidding me.
Wait.

35:28.836 --> 35:30.042
[Chuckles]

35:30.129 --> 35:32.541
I also have an app
that gives you song titles.

35:32.673 --> 35:34.914
All you have to do
is hum a few notes—
Maybe later, okay?

35:35.009 --> 35:37.000
Okay, it should be
behind all of this.

35:39.013 --> 35:40.173
[ Booth ]
Look at that.

35:40.264 --> 35:42.846
[ Booth ]
Careful.

35:50.024 --> 35:52.731
Check this out.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.809
Someone was cooking heroin.

35:54.903 --> 35:57.030
[ Sweets ]
So, maybe Phi/l/p
follows Neal down here,

35:57.114 --> 36:02.234
sees him using,
decides to administer a little
electroshock on the spot.

36:08.292 --> 36:10.704
[Brennan ]
Burnt flesh
on the transformer.

36:10.794 --> 36:13.251
And blood on the water pipe.

36:13.380 --> 36:14.369
Booth?
Yeah.

36:14.465 --> 36:15.875
Oh, my God.

36:15.966 --> 36:17.877
The electrical circuit
must have been completed...

36:17.968 --> 36:20.084
when Neal backed
into this water pipe.

36:21.472 --> 36:23.884
[ Sweets ]
Look what I found.

36:36.904 --> 36:39.316
“Welcome to hell.”

36:51.043 --> 36:53.034
I ran a simulation
of the electrocution...

36:53.128 --> 36:56.165
based on the current
that was generated by
the equipment at Havenhurst.

36:56.298 --> 36:59.085
Wait. But he’s not dead.
Yeah, I know.

36:59.176 --> 37:02.589
Based on Neal’s age and weight,
plus the clothes he was wearing,

37:02.679 --> 37:04.590
that current would have
thrown h/m clear.

37:04.681 --> 37:08.219
- And he should have survived.
- Plus the muscular
contortions and spasms...

37:08.310 --> 37:11.643
were nowhere near violent
enough to fracture his wrist.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.231
So, then what happened?

37:13.315 --> 37:16.523
What if Neal Lowery wasn’t
wearing his rubber-soled boots?

37:16.610 --> 37:18.726
Okay. Give me a second.

37:18.821 --> 37:21.028
You know, I just don’t
think that someone...

37:21.115 --> 37:25.575
who just shot himself up
with heroin is likely
to, uh, put his boots on.

37:25.702 --> 37:28.159
Why?
Well, ’cause
he’s on the nod.

37:28.247 --> 37:32.331
That means that he, uh, vomits
and succumbs to the euphoria.

37:32.418 --> 37:35.581
Wow. Listen to you,
all street.

37:35.671 --> 37:38.333
Maybe Phillip administered
the heroin to Neal...

37:38.424 --> 37:40.756
as though it were some kind
of legitimate medicine.

37:40.843 --> 37:43.004
No. Between the toes—
that’s not legitimate.

37:43.095 --> 37:46.178
- The guy is crazy, Sweets.
- But he’s consistent.

37:46.265 --> 37:50.508
Phillip operates rationally
behind his delusions.
He believes he’s a doctor.

37:50.602 --> 37:55.096
Angela, can you call up a photo
of Neal’s boots as they
were found on the remains?

37:55.190 --> 37:56.691
Mm-hmm.
I Typing i

37:56.775 --> 37:58.686
[ Beeping ]
Okay.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.893
Here.

38:00.988 --> 38:03.525
Okay, let me get in closer.

38:04.908 --> 38:07.570
Neal Lowery was left-handed.
He didn’t tie these shoes.

38:07.661 --> 38:09.276
What? How can you tell?

38:09.371 --> 38:11.362
Well, a left-handed person,
double knotting—

38:11.457 --> 38:13.368
the second knot
would loop behind.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.370
This one loops in front.

38:15.461 --> 38:18.703
[Ange/a ] Yeah, but st/ll,
it must have been a left-handed
person who tied the knot.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.288
Only he or she must have
been facing the victim.

38:21.383 --> 38:23.874
Oh. That is amazing.

38:23.969 --> 38:26.381
I think. It’s al—
lt’s also very confusing.

38:26.472 --> 38:31.512
I am ready to run
the simulation with the boots
removed from the equation.

38:36.899 --> 38:39.732
That’s it.
He was electrocuted first,

38:39.818 --> 38:42.434
and then his boots put back on
after he was dead.

38:42.529 --> 38:45.646
Double knots—
that’s the way someone
would treat a child.

38:45.741 --> 38:47.697
I say we’re looking
for somebody left-handed.

38:47.784 --> 38:51.447
I say the killer may have left
his or her DNA. on the laces.

39:00.756 --> 39:04.624
It’s not possible.
It’s just not possible.
Gabe wouldn’t kill his brother.

39:04.718 --> 39:09.303
Mrs. Lowery, what you
and your family went through—

39:09.389 --> 39:11.300
it’s almost unbearable.

39:11.391 --> 39:13.973
Gabe loved his brother.
Why would he do
such a thing?

39:14.061 --> 39:17.349
We know that Gabe went to visit
Neal the night he disappeared.

39:17.439 --> 39:19.725
We believe that there was
another patient. . .

39:19.816 --> 39:24.435
named Phillip who told Gabe
about Neal’s hideout
in the basement.

39:25.739 --> 39:27.775
Gabe found Neal
shooting up heroin.

39:28.784 --> 39:31.116
Gabe struck Neal with a pipe.

39:31.203 --> 39:37.164
Neal fell back
into a transformer
and was electrocuted.

39:37.251 --> 39:41.620
But the church?
The burning on the altar?

39:41.713 --> 39:46.582
We all become angry at God
sometimes, Mrs. Lowery.

39:49.096 --> 39:51.758
[ Mrs. Lowery]
Who could blame him ?

39:51.848 --> 39:55.215
Why did God do this to my family?
We were good people.

39:55.310 --> 39:57.926
And then—

39:58.021 --> 40:00.103
this.

40:01.275 --> 40:03.266
I’m sorry for your pain.

40:03.360 --> 40:05.476
You—

40:06.738 --> 40:08.649
You can’t even
imagine my pain.

40:30.846 --> 40:33.713
[ Brennan ]
I need to ask you
some things.

40:33.807 --> 40:36.765
You gonna ask me
about God and the devil?

40:36.852 --> 40:38.513
Yes.

40:38.604 --> 40:42.472
You’re gonna ask me
how God can place
such a burden on good people.

40:42.566 --> 40:48.311
No. I’m going to ask you how
you still believe in a kind god
after a case like this.

40:48.405 --> 40:51.147
Is my faith shaken?

40:51.241 --> 40:54.074
Yeah. Mm-hmm. It is.

40:54.161 --> 40:56.152
It is?

40:56.246 --> 40:59.113
Yeah. I’ll go home tonight
and I’ll lie in bed...

40:59.207 --> 41:04.577
and I’ll toss and I’ll turn
and I’ll beat myself up,

41:04.671 --> 41:07.003
and,uh,
I’ll question everything.

41:07.132 --> 41:11.045
Will you get
your faith back?
Always have in the past.

41:11.136 --> 41:14.720
So, you have faith that you
will retain your faith?

41:16.099 --> 41:18.010
Why?

41:18.101 --> 41:21.093
Because, Bones,

41:21.188 --> 41:23.930
the sun will come up,
and tomorrow’s a new day.

41:26.693 --> 41:29.070
I know that feeling.
[ Chuckles ]

41:29.196 --> 41:31.187
Really?
Mm-hmm.

41:31.281 --> 41:34.114
You know what it feels like
to get your faith back?

41:34.201 --> 41:37.614
When I see effects and I’m
unable to discern the cause,

41:37.704 --> 41:41.117
my faith in reason
and consequences is shaken.

41:42.209 --> 41:44.291
Then what happens?

41:45.629 --> 41:47.585
Two plus two equals four.

41:48.882 --> 41:52.124
I put sugar in my coffee,
and it tastes sweet.

41:52.219 --> 41:56.713
The sun comes up
because the world turns.

41:58.183 --> 42:00.094
These things
are beautiful to me.

42:02.354 --> 42:05.846
There are mysteries
I will never understand.

42:05.941 --> 42:09.058
But everywhere I look,

42:09.152 --> 42:12.019
| see proof that for every effect...

42:12.114 --> 42:14.730
there is a corresponding cause,

42:14.825 --> 42:17.908
even if! can’t see it.

42:17.994 --> 42:20.155
| find that reassuring.

42:21.206 --> 42:23.117
And life is good again.

42:23.208 --> 42:25.745
[ Chuckles ]
Life is very good.

42:25.836 --> 42:27.121
Yes, it is.

42:27.254 --> 42:30.121
Amen
[Laughs]

43:10.672 --> 43:12.037
What’s that mean?
