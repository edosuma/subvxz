04:11.720 --> 04:12.920
Damn!

04:23.040 --> 04:26.760
Whiskey, let's find us
a nice little bank.

04:27.240 --> 04:30.640
What do you know? I'm the boss.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.560
That does it, Whiskey.

04:38.840 --> 04:42.360
Now just for that, I'm going in alone.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.560
Without me, you'll wind up
holding a broken chair together.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.760
You say something?

05:07.560 --> 05:09.000
Okay...

05:09.240 --> 05:12.360
...but remember, I'm boss.

05:27.520 --> 05:31.800
Cactus Jack Slade waits in the shade

05:32.040 --> 05:35.240
Pondering his evil schemes

05:35.920 --> 05:39.320
He's a well- known bad guy

05:39.520 --> 05:45.200
Ready to try whatever it takes
To live up to his name

05:45.440 --> 05:49.160
No one is safe from the villain

05:49.960 --> 05:53.560
He totes a dangerous gun

05:54.000 --> 05:58.600
And robbing and stealing
And just plain dirty dealing

05:58.840 --> 06:02.360
Cactus Jack Slade gets it done

06:12.320 --> 06:15.960
Get off the streets, he's the villain

06:17.040 --> 06:19.160
Meet me in front.

06:24.600 --> 06:28.880
Close all the stores
Lock all the doors

06:29.120 --> 06:33.360
Cactus Jack Slade has arrived

06:39.920 --> 06:42.400
- Who is it?
- The sheriff.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.360
Open up.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.800
You're not the sheriff.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.160
I lied.

06:57.200 --> 07:02.960
One, close the door. Two, open the
safe. Three, on the floor.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.760
You forgot number two.

07:17.960 --> 07:23.560
Oh, no, I didn't. I did that
when you stuck that gun in my face.

07:24.240 --> 07:27.600
- Open that safe.
- The safe is locked for the night.

07:27.840 --> 07:31.800
And only Mr. Simpson
has the combination.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.320
I'm just a clerk.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.960
Excuse me.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.160
Got a light?

08:01.400 --> 08:03.960
How about a cigar?

08:04.160 --> 08:06.160
I don't smoke.

08:36.679 --> 08:38.679
Oh, I should've had two...

08:38.919 --> 08:42.760
- What's that noise?
- It came from the bank.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.360
The sheriff's coming.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.960
What are you doing, you traitor?
Whiskey? You traitor!

09:07.200 --> 09:09.120
I'll get even with you.

09:09.320 --> 09:11.680
You won't get away with this.

09:11.880 --> 09:14.200
Traitor! I'll get even with you.

09:14.440 --> 09:18.600
Get your hands off me.
Nobody pushes me around like this.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.760
Here, ma'am, let me help you
cross the street.

09:42.440 --> 09:46.080
Are you blind?
Don't you see all these horses?

09:46.320 --> 09:50.160
We'll never live through this.
Watch out!

09:50.800 --> 09:55.920
Are you trying to get me killed?
Oh, this is terrible.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.360
Here, let me help you, ma'am.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.560
See, Mother, safe and sound.

10:02.760 --> 10:05.160
First of all, I ain't your mother.

10:05.360 --> 10:08.680
Secondly,
take your arm off me, dummy!

10:08.920 --> 10:13.760
And third, I didn't want to cross
the street in the first place.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.960
Yes, ma'am.

10:31.320 --> 10:34.560
Charming, you're gonna miss
your train.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.800
Now remember what I told you.

10:37.040 --> 10:41.880
Avery Simpson would steal the candy
from a young'un if he got the chance.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.160
- Are you listening?
- Yes, Papa.

10:44.360 --> 10:47.200
- Them shoes still on that mare?
- Hell, yes.

10:47.440 --> 10:52.400
There's enough silver in that hill
to make a St. Louis hooker happy...

10:52.640 --> 10:56.000
...but it won't do no good
in the hills, understand?

10:56.200 --> 11:00.200
So you watch out
for that thieving Avery Simpson...

11:00.440 --> 11:04.360
...or he'll wind up owning
all of my mine. You follow me?

11:07.520 --> 11:09.800
One ticket to Snake's End.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.400
That'll do it,
one ticket to Snake's End.

11:13.640 --> 11:17.360
Going away on a business trip,
Mr. Parody?

11:17.560 --> 11:20.160
None of your business, Charming.

11:20.360 --> 11:24.560
Well, here's your ticket.
Well, take it. Bite on it.

11:24.760 --> 11:28.640
I'll get ahold of somebody to meet you
in Snake's End.

11:28.840 --> 11:31.400
And he'll protect you.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.400
I can take care of myself.

11:34.600 --> 11:39.520
Charming, I'm not worried about...
I'm worried about the money!

11:39.720 --> 11:42.480
Bring the money right back
to the house.

11:42.720 --> 11:47.960
- And be careful of strangers.
- Yes, Daddy.

11:58.040 --> 12:00.160
Pardon me, sir.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.720
- I'm Handsome Stranger.
- So?

12:04.120 --> 12:06.880
That's my name.
You have a telegram for me.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.760
Boy, you talk...

12:12.040 --> 12:13.160
...funny.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.360
Well, that's easy for you to say.
What about my telegram?

12:18.360 --> 12:20.760
So I did. I forgot to write it down.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.360
With all that commotion
and everything...

12:24.640 --> 12:27.160
...going over at the bank...

12:27.360 --> 12:30.800
But I do recollect what it said.

12:31.040 --> 12:33.600
It was from a guy named...

12:34.160 --> 12:36.600
...Parody Jones. He said...

12:36.840 --> 12:41.760
...his daughter was coming into town
to pick something up at the bank.

12:41.960 --> 12:45.160
And that you are supposed
to escort her...

12:45.640 --> 12:47.760
...back out to his...

12:48.520 --> 12:50.160
...place.

12:53.720 --> 12:57.280
And then he said something
about you owing him.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.560
That's true.

12:59.840 --> 13:04.360
He saved my life once.
I've been beholden to him ever since.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.360
When is Miss Jones arriving?

13:08.240 --> 13:09.560
Miss Jones is...

13:09.760 --> 13:13.360
Miss Jones is coming in
On the evening train

13:13.560 --> 13:15.560
Do I still have time to eat?

13:15.800 --> 13:20.880
Sure, you do. Just go on over
to the Broken Spoke and eat.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.880
Broken Spoke? It's a saloon.

13:23.080 --> 13:26.440
That's right.
And this here's a telegraph office.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.920
To send a telegram, you come here.

13:30.160 --> 13:32.240
It's the only place in town.

13:32.440 --> 13:36.880
To eat, you go to the Broken Spoke,
because it's the only place in...

13:37.040 --> 13:38.960
Thank you. Thank you.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.640
...town.

13:41.800 --> 13:46.360
Oh, I don't believe it.
Oh, easy. Go slow, go slow.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.200
What happened?

13:52.440 --> 13:56.560
She was trying to cross the street.
Got hit by a beer wagon.

13:56.760 --> 14:01.560
I always say that alcohol and driving
don't mix. What a pity.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.360
I thought I heard that voice!

14:05.560 --> 14:09.920
Get out! I'll kill you!
Stop this stretcher! Get that man!

14:10.120 --> 14:14.680
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't
have been hurt. Turn around!

14:14.840 --> 14:17.800
Turn this stretcher! Get that man!

14:18.040 --> 14:23.560
I'll teach you when I want to cross
the street!

14:24.000 --> 14:27.960
You leave me alone!
I'm gonna make you...

14:39.200 --> 14:42.440
- Morning, Mr. Avery.
- I want to see your prisoner.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.560
I want to see him alone.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.360
Traitor.

14:56.840 --> 14:59.760
- Cactus Jack?
- Who are you?

14:59.960 --> 15:02.160
I'm Avery Simpson.

15:02.840 --> 15:05.960
I own the bank you blew up last night.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.720
I used too much dynamite.

15:10.040 --> 15:13.360
Well, I'm not mad at you
for blowing up my bank.

15:13.520 --> 15:17.200
I'm not even mad at you for trying
to blow my safe apart.

15:17.360 --> 15:21.040
I don't keep any money in it anyway.
I don't trust banks.

15:21.440 --> 15:24.560
- You know why I'm not mad at you?
- Why?

15:25.720 --> 15:30.360
Because you and me may be able
to do business together.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.960
Now if we can...

15:34.160 --> 15:37.160
...you'll walk out of here with me
scot-free.

15:37.960 --> 15:42.160
And I'll give you $1000 cash tomorrow.

15:44.040 --> 15:49.280
If we can't do business together,
the sheriff is gonna hang you...

15:49.520 --> 15:51.160
...tonight.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.960
I don't know.

15:56.120 --> 15:59.360
- Well?
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.440
- It's a deal.
- Good.

16:15.840 --> 16:19.160
A year ago I grubstaked
an old prospector.

16:19.360 --> 16:22.760
For that I got half of everything.
You follow me?

16:23.280 --> 16:25.920
Now he needs more money
to work the mine.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.960
He's putting up the other half
as collateral.

16:29.120 --> 16:32.200
I'm gonna lend him that money.
You follow me?

16:32.640 --> 16:36.400
His daughter will take the cash back
in the morning.

16:36.640 --> 16:42.080
I don't want it to get there.
If it don't, I'll get the whole mine.

16:42.320 --> 16:46.920
- You still follow me?
- What about a little advance?

16:51.520 --> 16:56.360
Here's $20, which
I'll deduct from the 500 you'll earn.

16:56.560 --> 17:00.280
You made mention of $1000,
didn't you?

17:00.480 --> 17:04.160
I thought I made mention of a hanging,
didn't I?

17:26.880 --> 17:29.960
Five hundred dollars.

17:35.800 --> 17:40.760
Whiskey, if you behave,
we're gonna be rich. Real rich.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.960
Whiskey.

18:19.840 --> 18:23.760
Not you. Stay outside.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.760
Leave the bottle.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.960
That's an uppercut.

19:06.720 --> 19:09.160
That's a left cross.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.960
And that's a two-by-four.

19:30.240 --> 19:31.400
Thank you.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.960
Mr. Stranger...

19:38.760 --> 19:42.960
...the evening train's coming.
I just heard the...

19:43.520 --> 19:46.960
...blow.
It's at Five-Mile Crossing.

19:47.160 --> 19:51.480
Then the train has five miles to go.
I still can finish my meal.

19:51.720 --> 19:56.960
If you want to meet the old train
you'd better come now because...

19:57.600 --> 20:01.600
...Five-Mile Crossing is only
half a mile down the t...

20:01.840 --> 20:04.160
- Track?
- Way.

20:04.360 --> 20:05.960
Really?

20:06.240 --> 20:08.160
I'd better go.

20:18.120 --> 20:22.400
Charming
Charming

20:22.640 --> 20:27.160
There ain't no woman in these parts
That looks as good as you

20:27.440 --> 20:31.560
Charming
Charming

20:32.200 --> 20:35.960
Don't forget
What you were sent to do

20:54.240 --> 20:56.720
Pardon me. Pardon me.

20:58.440 --> 21:01.760
Would you mind taking hold of these,
please?

21:02.000 --> 21:03.760
Well, yes, ma'am.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.560
Wonderful.

21:10.160 --> 21:13.600
You were the only lady
to get off the train.

21:13.840 --> 21:14.960
Yes, I was.

21:15.320 --> 21:19.160
- Then you must be Charming.
- You've said it all.

21:19.400 --> 21:22.680
I mean, Charming Jones.
Parody's daughter.

21:22.840 --> 21:25.920
I'm your pa's friend.
He told me to pick you up.

21:26.120 --> 21:28.960
- I'm Handsome Stranger.
- Yes, you are.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.120
- Let me help you.
- Thank you.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.600
My!

21:38.840 --> 21:42.760
- Shall we?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

22:03.360 --> 22:06.400
Handsome Stranger is such
a wonderful nickname.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.600
How did you get it?

22:08.840 --> 22:11.560
It's not a nickname.
It's my real name.

22:12.520 --> 22:16.000
- Really?
- Yes, I was named after my father.

22:16.240 --> 22:18.560
He must have been quite a man.

22:18.760 --> 22:21.960
I don't know. I never met him.

22:26.000 --> 22:31.200
How did you meet my daddy?
I never heard him mention your name.

22:31.440 --> 22:34.080
I met him in Denver.
He saved my life.

22:34.240 --> 22:38.120
He nursed me
after I got beat up by ruffians.

22:38.600 --> 22:43.160
Oh, dear. Why did they do that?

22:43.840 --> 22:45.600
You know, I don't know.

22:45.840 --> 22:49.640
But like I said,
it was a few years ago in Denver.

22:50.120 --> 22:54.560
I saw a bunch of crazy horses
running down Main Street.

22:54.800 --> 22:58.960
I finally realized
that these were runaways.

22:59.160 --> 23:03.640
So I jumped on my horse
and I chased them down the street.

23:03.840 --> 23:07.280
I ran after them.
It was crazy.

23:07.480 --> 23:11.960
They were going faster and faster.
I was catching up with them.

23:12.200 --> 23:16.800
There were children and women
and old men in danger in the street.

23:17.040 --> 23:21.000
It was really dangerous.
I tried to save them.

23:21.240 --> 23:24.360
You risked your life to try
to stop them.

23:24.560 --> 23:28.600
- I do this every day. I try to...
- Oh, how wonderful.

23:28.840 --> 23:32.800
So I kept running after them
and finally I did catch up.

23:37.240 --> 23:40.400
- What are you doing?
- I got them under control.

23:40.640 --> 23:43.240
Get him off my horse.

23:49.440 --> 23:52.560
You dummy. How am I gonna
make a living?

23:52.760 --> 23:56.280
That was the only cathouse in town.

24:00.440 --> 24:04.200
Excuse me, ma'am.
What do you do for a living?

24:04.840 --> 24:07.360
And that's the way it was.

24:08.120 --> 24:13.680
That was a brave and noble thing
you did, stopping that team of horses.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.160
Why, you could have been killed!

24:17.440 --> 24:19.560
Oh, yes.

25:13.440 --> 25:16.360
There's been a change of plans.

25:18.120 --> 25:22.240
The girl already got somebody
to ride shotgun for her.

25:22.440 --> 25:27.120
He don't look like much, but
it won't be easy to get the money.

25:27.280 --> 25:30.240
Why don't I just hold them up...?

25:31.160 --> 25:35.160
Why don't you just do that,
if you think you can handle it?

25:35.320 --> 25:37.800
What makes you think I can't?

25:37.960 --> 25:41.600
You did such a magnificent job
on the bank.

25:42.960 --> 25:48.320
Yeah, well, I've had a lot more
experience robbing people.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.880
Make sure you get that money.

25:51.120 --> 25:55.360
- I'll get it.
- Make sure you bring back all of it.

25:55.800 --> 25:59.200
- I'm not dishonest.
- And I'm not a trusting man.

25:59.400 --> 26:01.960
I always insure a risk.

26:39.400 --> 26:42.760
You take good care of that box,
young man.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.200
Charming, have a nice trip.
Say hi to your dad.

26:49.840 --> 26:52.760
We could've saved
some of Daddy's money...

26:53.000 --> 26:54.880
...by taking only one room.

26:55.120 --> 26:57.680
Oh, no, don't worry about it.

26:58.600 --> 27:01.160
I can pay for my own room.

27:52.640 --> 27:58.400
He was waiting at the station
When the train pulled in

27:58.640 --> 28:03.880
He was there to meet a lady
As a favour for a friend

28:04.920 --> 28:10.880
The stranger was a proud man
Who paid the debts he owed

28:11.080 --> 28:16.560
And it was his time to pay the debt
He owed from long ago

28:17.160 --> 28:21.640
Handsome Stranger
Where do you come from?

28:22.120 --> 28:25.160
No one seems to know
Your business here

28:26.200 --> 28:30.960
With your steel- blue eyes
And pearl handled guns

28:31.360 --> 28:34.880
There ain't an outlaw anywhere
You fear

28:36.160 --> 28:40.480
Handsome Stranger
Where do you come from?

28:40.920 --> 28:44.040
No one seems to know
Your business here

28:44.960 --> 28:49.960
With your steel- blue eyes
And pearl handled guns

28:50.320 --> 28:53.720
There ain't an outlaw anywhere
You fear

28:57.280 --> 29:01.760
Oh, let me straighten out the bags.
Can you hold this?

29:10.120 --> 29:12.680
- Are you gonna be long?
- No.

29:12.880 --> 29:16.120
- What are you doing?
- Tying down the bags.

29:21.680 --> 29:23.200
Higher.

29:27.240 --> 29:31.480
No.
I mean me, higher.

29:36.680 --> 29:39.520
Now, was that difficult?

29:42.520 --> 29:45.840
This is the day we strike it rich.

29:51.520 --> 29:56.200
One, I merely step out
in front of that wagon.

29:59.800 --> 30:05.000
That ought to stop them.
Two, I shoot the boyfriend.

30:07.360 --> 30:12.440
Three, I steal the money
and ravish that woman.

30:14.640 --> 30:19.320
Leaving that oily banker
with his thumb up his dumb.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.720
I'll handle this.

31:07.280 --> 31:10.560
- Did you hear that?
- No, I heard nothing.

31:10.760 --> 31:13.280
There was a big sound.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.560
Whiskey!

31:54.760 --> 31:57.080
Whiskey, where you been?

32:12.440 --> 32:17.440
Why does the banker want him watched?
He needs to be looked after.

32:27.320 --> 32:31.480
- I've never done this before.
- You're doing a good job.

32:31.680 --> 32:32.960
Oh, thank you.

32:33.160 --> 32:38.240
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Oh, you're so welcome.

32:41.320 --> 32:44.080
- What a relief!
- What?

32:44.240 --> 32:47.120
We passed the bend and
nothing happened.

32:47.360 --> 32:49.080
Yes, I know.

33:55.320 --> 33:58.240
Whiskey!

34:09.760 --> 34:13.880
- It sure is desolate out here.
- Yes, ma'am.

34:19.880 --> 34:26.400
Won't it be awful if we're robbed
or attacked by bandits?

34:28.880 --> 34:32.280
I hear they do
terrible things to women.

34:42.159 --> 34:45.560
You don't talk much, do you?

34:50.800 --> 34:54.280
I wish you'd make some conversation.

34:54.520 --> 35:00.440
Otherwise, it's going to be a very,
very dull trip.

35:00.760 --> 35:05.080
- What do you want to talk about?
- Oh, anything. Surprise me.

35:05.280 --> 35:10.280
You want to see my gun?
Bet you've never seen one like this.

35:13.440 --> 35:15.280
It's like any other gun.

35:15.520 --> 35:19.280
It just looks like any other gun,
but it's different.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.200
Oh, really?

35:21.880 --> 35:24.560
Well, tell me.
I'm dying to know.

35:24.800 --> 35:28.320
- This is a seven-shot six-shooter.
- Yeah?

35:28.520 --> 35:31.400
And I had it specially made.

35:32.680 --> 35:34.200
Why?

35:35.560 --> 35:38.360
- Why?
- Yes, why?

35:38.560 --> 35:40.200
I don't know.

35:42.080 --> 35:45.000
- Nobody asked me that before.
- I'll bet.

36:32.800 --> 36:36.440
Ah, I love those Latin hymns.

36:37.440 --> 36:41.800
Welcome, stranger.
You're a handsome stranger.

36:42.120 --> 36:47.640
I see by the guns you wear
that you're a man of violence.

36:47.960 --> 36:53.080
Violence is ignorance.
But it's not too late to be saved.

36:53.280 --> 36:57.120
The skies are darkening.
Soon, the rain will fall.

36:57.320 --> 36:59.520
The angels are weeping.

36:59.720 --> 37:03.360
Let their teardrops
cleanse your heart.

37:03.560 --> 37:06.160
- It's not too late to be saved.
- Really?

37:06.360 --> 37:11.000
You can be the salt of the earth,
the light of the life.

37:11.240 --> 37:14.120
- But you gotta stop drinking.
- I'm not.

37:14.520 --> 37:16.680
- No drinking.
- Never.

37:16.920 --> 37:18.560
- No cussing.
- Never.

37:18.800 --> 37:22.360
No dirty jokes.

37:25.760 --> 37:31.040
The wicked sprung up like grass and
the works of iniquity flourished...

37:31.240 --> 37:36.040
...it was so they might be destroyed.
Hand me your guns.

37:40.720 --> 37:45.120
Now, if I were a mind to rob you...

37:46.440 --> 37:49.640
...or perhaps
molest your lady friend...

37:49.840 --> 37:53.880
...this gun wouldn't scare you at all.

37:54.480 --> 37:57.280
Because we both know it's not loaded.

37:57.720 --> 38:03.040
- But I want to tell you that...
- Freeze. My gun is definitely loaded.

38:03.240 --> 38:04.680
Right.

38:04.840 --> 38:08.000
If I were to pull the trigger...

38:08.200 --> 38:10.840
...it wouldn't scare you.
- Reverend!

38:23.760 --> 38:26.720
I wish he wouldn't have left so soon.

38:26.920 --> 38:29.960
I think he really could've helped me.

38:30.640 --> 38:32.000
Me too.

38:33.520 --> 38:38.320
You and your seven-shot six-shooter.

38:58.160 --> 38:59.600
Whiskey.

39:00.680 --> 39:02.080
What happened?

39:18.480 --> 39:20.320
Behave yourself.

39:25.200 --> 39:31.680
Whiskey, when we steal that money,
we're gonna buy a nice spread.

39:32.160 --> 39:37.280
With a little corral
and a couple of cute fillies for you.

39:38.680 --> 39:43.120
I think I'll get me
a couple cute fillies too.

39:44.160 --> 39:48.600
Now, go away.
I gotta work this out.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.360
Yeah, this is gonna work.

42:15.320 --> 42:19.000
I like this place.
Let's spend the night here.

42:19.160 --> 42:21.040
Perfect.

42:37.080 --> 42:40.040
I'll take care of the team, okay?

42:45.680 --> 42:49.840
Charming
Charming

42:50.160 --> 42:54.920
There ain't no woman in these parts
That looks as good as you

42:55.120 --> 42:59.160
Charming
Charming

42:59.560 --> 43:02.520
Don't forget
What you were sent to do

43:03.960 --> 43:08.840
She came to town
With her head held high

43:10.160 --> 43:14.560
Cowboys smile when she walks by

43:15.960 --> 43:20.480
Across the badlands she does ride

43:21.480 --> 43:26.160
With a handsome stranger
By her side

43:27.760 --> 43:29.640
Charming

43:32.360 --> 43:34.400
Charming

43:34.840 --> 43:38.240
There ain't no woman
Looks as good as you

43:51.880 --> 43:53.520
What's the matter?

43:55.240 --> 43:59.040
- Do you know which way is north?
- Why?

43:59.480 --> 44:04.800
When we stay overnight here,
we point the wagon to the North Star.

44:05.360 --> 44:09.480
- We know in the morning where to go.
- Really?

44:09.880 --> 44:12.800
I read it in one of the
pioneer magazines.

44:14.760 --> 44:16.160
Tell you what.

44:16.360 --> 44:21.000
If we cross the river and stay on
the road we've been on all day...

44:21.200 --> 44:24.080
...we'll get to where we're going.

44:25.680 --> 44:30.720
- You're right.
- You know, I think I'll take a bath.

44:30.920 --> 44:33.320
I'll get some wood for the fire.

44:33.560 --> 44:37.080
Would you like to scrub my back?

44:37.360 --> 44:39.640
I'd better get the wood.

44:40.160 --> 44:43.680
I knew he'd say that.
I knew it.

45:47.480 --> 45:49.400
Handsome?

45:49.640 --> 45:51.600
Handsome, is that you?

46:00.960 --> 46:05.680
We should have packed a lunch.
It's gonna be a long job.

46:06.560 --> 46:09.480
You wanna Indian wrestle?

46:29.160 --> 46:31.280
Miss Charming?

46:31.520 --> 46:34.280
I've been lying here
and looking at you...

46:34.440 --> 46:37.240
...and thinking how fitting
your name is.

46:37.400 --> 46:41.280
I mean, it really does you justice.

46:42.560 --> 46:45.320
How did you get a name like that?

46:46.360 --> 46:49.360
It was the first thing
that my daddy said...

46:49.520 --> 46:52.600
...when he found out
they were going to have me.

46:52.840 --> 46:56.880
Mama said,
"Parody, I think I'm pregnant."

46:57.080 --> 47:01.880
And Daddy said,
"Oh, charming. Just charming."

47:02.880 --> 47:06.360
Your dad.
He's quite a guy, I'll tell you.

47:12.160 --> 47:14.040
Do you have a girl?

47:18.640 --> 47:21.400
Have you ever had a girl?

47:21.760 --> 47:24.840
I don't think so, Miss Charming.

47:37.440 --> 47:39.480
What are you gonna do?

47:44.480 --> 47:47.480
It's going to get cold tonight.

47:47.680 --> 47:51.520
So I think I'm getting
some wood for the fire.

48:03.680 --> 48:05.040
What the...?

48:07.360 --> 48:09.200
Respect!

48:10.520 --> 48:15.280
One of these days,
I'm gonna trade you in for a mule.

48:15.520 --> 48:19.160
Yeah, you think you're so
goldarned smart.

48:20.520 --> 48:23.040
I don't think that was so funny.

48:49.920 --> 48:51.120
Whiskey!

48:58.320 --> 48:59.560
Did you hear me?

49:02.960 --> 49:05.880
Then what are you standing there for?

49:15.440 --> 49:19.400
Anxious Beaver, look down there.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.640
Over there.

49:28.120 --> 49:31.280
- It's him.
- Him it is.

49:35.760 --> 49:38.080
That's a very smart horse.

49:38.320 --> 49:42.800
Now, that's a horse for you, Mary.

49:57.880 --> 49:59.560
My braves!

50:16.160 --> 50:20.480
We're gonna have a necktie party,
Mr. Handsome Stranger.

50:20.720 --> 50:25.720
You're gonna be the guest of honour,
Mr. Handsome Stranger.

50:52.920 --> 50:54.440
Whiskey!

50:57.960 --> 51:00.040
Whiskey!

51:46.480 --> 51:48.760
I'll tell you when.

52:13.640 --> 52:14.960
Missed.

52:15.160 --> 52:19.720
Rock went behind. Gonna hit the thing.
I don't get that.

53:40.960 --> 53:45.560
It's chapter six.
"The tunnel in the hillside."

54:15.240 --> 54:17.560
Right there.

54:57.040 --> 54:59.360
Did you see that?

55:36.360 --> 55:38.960
Oh, what do you know?

55:43.240 --> 55:45.760
This is a shortcut.

55:49.040 --> 55:51.360
Watch this.

56:08.240 --> 56:11.760
I'll show you how to handle
these situations.

56:14.400 --> 56:16.360
Here.

56:18.200 --> 56:20.160
Back up.

56:30.200 --> 56:32.760
Keep it that way.

56:35.440 --> 56:37.760
Keep it taut.

57:01.440 --> 57:03.880
Back up!

57:04.040 --> 57:05.720
Back up!

57:06.600 --> 57:09.360
Do you hear me?

58:05.640 --> 58:10.160
We've got to be careful from here on.
This is Indian country.

58:14.760 --> 58:20.360
- Indian County.
- County?

58:30.640 --> 58:35.760
Whiskey, this book has been
fouling me up.

58:37.000 --> 58:40.600
I don't need Jesse James.

58:40.840 --> 58:43.560
Or Doc Holliday.

58:43.760 --> 58:46.360
Or Billy the Kid.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.160
I don't need anybody.

58:49.360 --> 58:53.960
From now on, I do it my way.

58:54.560 --> 58:58.160
Cactus Jack Slade.

59:48.840 --> 59:53.600
Why does old enemy...

59:53.840 --> 59:58.240
...Prickly Jack come to Nervous Elk?

59:58.640 --> 01:00:02.960
It's Cactus Jack. Cactus Jack Slade.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:07.600
I come to speak with straight tongue.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.560
Tongue may be straight...

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:16.160
...but mouth hide many sharp teeth.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:21.560
I seek great chief's help.
I lost my heart to a girl.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.760
- Can't you talk without your hands?
- Yeah, well...

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:30.360
...this fellow that's with her
is one big mean critter.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:36.560
How can this tired old warrior help?

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.800
I was hoping that if you and me
and a bunch of these braves...

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.800
...were to pop out
sudden-like at him...

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:48.760
...he wouldn't be so likely
to start a ruckus.

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:55.600
You want nothing from this man...

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.000
...but woman?
- Not one thing.

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:00.560
Well, I'd take the buckboard.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.160
She couldn't ride a horse
dressed like she is.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.960
I'd even give him my horse.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:10.360
I'm still willing
to do him a kindness.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:15.560
Giving him that horse no kindness.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:28.960
What's in it for Nervous Elk?

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:35.760
- Scalps.
- Scalps?

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:41.960
- Come now, Many-Sticker John.
- It's Cactus Jack Slade.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.960
Whatever.

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:50.600
Scalps don't put beans on table.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.960
I'll share the woman.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.960
White woman crazy.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:06.200
They all keep one bullet in gun.

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.200
Yeah, I heard that.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.800
By the way, I've been meaning
to ask you...

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:17.160
What do you Indians do when
you capture a white woman?

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:23.760
Nervous Elk not know.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.200
Crazy white woman always shoots self
before me have chance to find out!

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.760
All except one.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.800
Who, by mistake...

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.600
...shoot Nervous Elk...

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.440
...in the jewels.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:47.160
Yeah, I remember.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:50.760
For old-time's sake, will you help me?

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:55.560
Me like nearsighted elk
that make love to cactus...

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:58.360
...been stuck before.

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.000
We will help.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.520
I knew I could count on my friend.
Thanks, chief.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.760
Now what's the matter with you?

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.840
What's wrong?

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.160
I wasn't gonna give you away.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:38.800
Come here. I was just saying that.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.560
See you at the camp.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:00.360
That man is here to steal money,
isn't he?

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:04.560
And if you help him,
you'll be stealing also.

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:08.360
But you've given your word
to the banker.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:12.280
- Would you go back on it now?
- Uh-huh.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.040
- What about that white man?
- Piss on the white man.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.800
Listen to those drums!
It's so scary.

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:56.360
Don't worry. They never attack
until daylight.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.560
Really?

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.440
Thank you.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.600
Know what? He's gonna
set the Indian back 50 years.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:27.160
I don't know which is worse,
him or those damn drums.

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:32.160
This is the plan of attack.
Go over it with your troops.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:35.360
- Okay, chief.
- Good brave.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.400
Well, Handsome...

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:44.400
...this is our last night together.
- Yeah.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:49.760
Tomorrow at this time you'll be home
safe and sound with your daddy.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:57.160
- I'm not really sleepy, are you?
- Oh, no, I'm wide awake.

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.160
Good.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.560
What have you got in mind?

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.320
- I know what.
- What?

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:15.120
- Want to hear some knock-knock jokes?
- I'll get some wood for the fire.

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:19.000
We attack at dawn.

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:23.400
Chief, why don't we attack now,
when they're off guard?

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:27.400
- Indians never attack till dawn.
- I know, but why?

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:33.560
Because at night, Indians too busy
pounding on those dumb drums!

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.360
There they are!

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:08.760
- What are we waiting for?
- It not dawn yet.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.840
Until 6:28 and 45 seconds,
according to almanac.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:17.240
Chief, you sure your braves
can handle this?

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:22.560
My people greatest light cavalry
ever mount horse!

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.960
- I hope so.
- It dawn!

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.600
My braves, prepare to mount!

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:36.760
Prepare to mount!

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.640
Mount!

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:44.200
Mount!

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.400
Charge!

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:21.000
- Chief!
- Set up field hospital!

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:25.240
Count casualties!
Prepare for another attack!

01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:29.000
- Prepare for attack!
- Will you shut up?

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:34.800
Chief, I appreciate your help, but...

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:39.359
...it's not gonna work out.
- My word is bond!

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:43.000
Hey, Beaver, any braves still moving?

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:46.359
- Yeah, chief, two.
- Good. Get mounted!

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:51.359
- Get mounted!
- Four of us will continue.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:57.760
No fear, Porcupine Jack.
You're in good hands.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.160
No, it's Cactus Jack.
Cactus Jack Slade!

01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:06.160
Jeez, I'm gonna do it my own way.

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:08.560
Whiskey!

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:14.120
- Did anybody see my horse?
- He went thataway.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.960
Whiskey!

01:09:22.439 --> 01:09:24.960
Whiskey!

01:09:28.439 --> 01:09:30.200
Thattaboy, Handsome!

01:09:30.439 --> 01:09:32.840
Son of a gun!

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.600
They're gaining on us. Come on!

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.880
Keep them between the ditches!

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:11.520
Yeah, you tell them! Come on, Bumper!

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:14.400
You're looking good! Come on, honey!

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:19.800
- They're getting closer, Handsome.
- I know.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.960
I don't know what got them so mad.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:26.760
Well, I'll tell you, I don't know.
It could be...

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.800
...those knock-knock jokes.
I don't know.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:32.840
- Really?
- Really.

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.680
But I do know we're slowing down.

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:44.600
I think you better go a little
faster, because they're gonna get us.

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:48.960
I can't go any faster.
These horses are really tired.

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:55.360
Well, in a little ways
you're gonna be safe.

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.520
- What do you mean, ma'am?
- Trust me.

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.360
There it is.

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.240
You, back over here...

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.760
...where you belong.

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:34.760
- That was pretty close, chief.
- Close not good enough.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:40.320
Well, braves, back to bead-stringing.

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.200
Bye-bye, chief. Maybe next time!

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:54.160
And I got all dressed up for nothing.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:03.160
On tiptoe.

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.560
Stop.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.760
Whiskey?

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.960
Whiskey?

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.360
Whiskey!

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.560
Excuse me, ma'am?

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:09.200
Isn't it dangerous to have
blasting powder in the house?

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:11.320
I really don't care.

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:20.960
We got 'em.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.680
I don't need your help.

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:45.680
Whiskey, you've got
a funny sense of humour.

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:55.360
What did you do in there?

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:02.760
Take another step,
and I'll ventilate you.

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:10.160
Nobody outsmarts Cactus Jack Slade.

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.560
Hold it.

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:20.160
Like the man said, just hold it.

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:35.080
Exactly what are your intentions?

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:37.480
To see that justice is done.

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:42.400
And yours?

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:44.200
Blow his head off.

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:47.760
- Steal the money.
- And?

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.600
Then I'm gonna ravish you.

01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:59.520
Handsome, you lose.

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:05.200
What's his name here just outbid you.
