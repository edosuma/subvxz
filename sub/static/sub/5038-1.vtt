03:46.439 --> 03:48.373
No more.

03:59.219 --> 04:01.687
Is that supposed
to scare me?

04:01.855 --> 04:04.415
- Don't be a wise-ass!
- Just take it easy.

04:04.591 --> 04:07.583
Commander Farrell's trying
to lay it out for us.

04:07.761 --> 04:09.854
Why don't you guys knock it off.

04:10.597 --> 04:14.089
How did you actually meet
the secretary of defense?

04:17.504 --> 04:22.271
I was introduced to him by Pritchard.
I met him when I was in college.

04:22.442 --> 04:24.876
- Pritchard?
- Yeah, Scott Pritchard!

04:25.044 --> 04:27.012
Jesus.

04:27.180 --> 04:29.944
General counsel
for the secretary of defense.

04:30.116 --> 04:32.914
You got it?
Look, you know this already.

04:43.696 --> 04:46.324
When's he gonna come
out from behind here?

04:46.499 --> 04:47.761
Six Months Earlier

04:48.501 --> 04:51.265
- Yes, sir.
- Got it.

04:55.041 --> 04:57.134
Good evening, sir.

04:58.678 --> 05:00.578
Get that limo out of here.

05:00.747 --> 05:03.181
- Hi.
- Move that car.

05:13.259 --> 05:14.317
Thank you.

05:22.802 --> 05:27.330
Lucky it's not a bullshit detector
or else none of us would get in.

05:43.423 --> 05:45.755
- How are you Scott?
- Hi, Tom. How are you?

05:45.925 --> 05:47.256
- Fine.
- You look great.

05:47.427 --> 05:52.091
Thank you for the invitation. I'm not
used to being in places like this.

05:52.265 --> 05:56.224
I suspect you'd like to.
I take it you'd like to join our staff.

05:56.402 --> 05:59.269
That was the purpose
of the note, wasn't it?

05:59.439 --> 06:03.205
It was a Christmas card.
And as I recall, the message was:

06:03.376 --> 06:04.673
"Merry Christmas."

06:04.844 --> 06:06.835
Yes, thank you very much.

06:07.013 --> 06:09.072
David, Scott is here.

06:09.249 --> 06:12.912
Come on. I want
to introduce you to someone.

06:13.820 --> 06:16.254
- Hello.
- Scott, how nice to see you.

06:16.422 --> 06:18.549
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.

06:18.725 --> 06:20.556
- Scott, how are you?
- Hello.

06:20.727 --> 06:23.924
This is Commander Farrell,
the officer I mentioned.

06:24.097 --> 06:27.533
He has experience on the joint
staff and naval intelligence.

06:27.700 --> 06:32.069
Everyone I know is looking forward
to serving under you for another term.

06:32.238 --> 06:34.172
You must have a
limited acquaintanceship.

06:34.340 --> 06:38.003
- Tom and I were at college together.
- Good.

06:39.112 --> 06:40.875
He has great warmth.

06:41.948 --> 06:43.882
- He's a genius.
- Oh?

06:44.050 --> 06:46.746
The normal rules don't apply.

06:46.920 --> 06:51.118
You know, some people think
you're really the brains.

06:51.291 --> 06:52.849
Do they?

06:54.027 --> 06:58.020
Is that supposed to flatter me?
He's the most extraordinary...

06:58.197 --> 07:01.758
...person I've ever met.
I'd lay down my life for him.

07:01.935 --> 07:04.335
Is that a job requirement?

07:31.764 --> 07:35.598
It was fantastic having
the president here this evening.

07:35.768 --> 07:38.999
You'II agree we can look
forward to a fine four years.

07:39.172 --> 07:42.767
Let's continue to keep our inaugural
hair down with more music.

07:42.942 --> 07:45.706
Let's do it right now.
All right? Come on.

07:45.878 --> 07:48.176
Yeah. All right.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.873
Excuse me,
do you have a light?

08:19.645 --> 08:24.810
If you want to look down my dress,
you should grow a few inches.

08:27.020 --> 08:31.957
- Wanna dance?
- The twist? No, thank you.

08:32.125 --> 08:34.116
Well, we don't have to twist.

08:34.293 --> 08:37.227
- No meant no.
- "No" wasn't a figure of speech?

08:37.397 --> 08:39.092
No.

08:40.099 --> 08:43.330
- You're pretty impressed with me.
- No.

08:44.771 --> 08:47.763
Yes, you are.

08:52.078 --> 08:53.978
Stoli, straight up.

08:58.418 --> 09:00.443
So I was impressed.

09:00.620 --> 09:02.451
- Yeah. Want a drink?
- Same.

09:02.622 --> 09:04.317
Make it two.

09:05.291 --> 09:06.451
You one of them?

09:07.627 --> 09:10.892
- One of who?
- These hypocrites, all fat and shiny...

09:11.064 --> 09:14.090
...gearing up to ram it to us
for four more years.

09:14.267 --> 09:16.565
- Are you one of them?
- No.

09:16.736 --> 09:18.795
I'II bet you are.

09:20.406 --> 09:22.704
You're pretty cynical.

09:22.875 --> 09:25.605
Adequate to the occasion.

09:30.716 --> 09:35.176
We have a potential
nausea situation building here.

09:38.391 --> 09:43.693
- Let's get out of here.
- My date's not gonna like that much.

09:43.863 --> 09:45.922
But what the hell.

09:46.099 --> 09:48.533
His wife will be delighted.

09:49.702 --> 09:52.967
Is this something
we should talk about?

09:53.139 --> 09:54.936
Nope.

10:00.379 --> 10:03.644
- Where would you like to go?
- Show us the monuments.

11:13.819 --> 11:17.186
- What's your name?
- Bill.

11:17.823 --> 11:21.020
How you doing, Bill?
You wanna shut the slide?

11:21.928 --> 11:24.089
- Sure.
- Sorry, Bill.

12:41.841 --> 12:43.775
My name's Tom.

12:48.314 --> 12:50.407
I'm Susan.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.785
We're here.

13:00.626 --> 13:02.457
- Is this your apartment?
- No.

13:02.628 --> 13:04.789
I have a key to my apartment.

13:04.964 --> 13:07.728
- It better be good.
- We need your bed.

13:07.900 --> 13:11.427
Nina, Tom. Tom, Nina. There's
a limousine downstairs.

13:11.604 --> 13:15.973
There's booze in my pantry,
the refrigerator's full of food.

13:16.142 --> 13:18.110
Why don't you go to your place?

13:18.277 --> 13:21.246
It's just one of those things.
Be a friend.

13:21.414 --> 13:26.181
If anybody calls, tell them I died
or that I'm asleep, all right?

13:26.352 --> 13:28.320
- He won't call.
- I'II think of something.

13:28.487 --> 13:30.421
- Here are the keys.
- I gotta change.

13:30.589 --> 13:33.387
Everything you need
is in the back seat.

13:33.559 --> 13:36.357
- You didn't.
- Hey, now, you better beat it...

13:36.529 --> 13:39.123
...before I get arrested.

13:39.298 --> 13:43.166
- Bye, Nina.
- Oh, nice meeting you, Tom.

13:44.470 --> 13:46.301
Nice to meet you, Nina.

13:46.472 --> 13:48.235
Move it.

13:52.178 --> 13:55.045
- Get it out of here.
- Okay, asshole. Come on.

13:55.214 --> 13:59.310
Hey, break it up. I gotta make
a living. Can we move it along?

13:59.485 --> 14:04.354
The white zone is for loading and
unloading passengers only. No parking.

14:17.203 --> 14:19.330
Take care of yourself.

14:19.805 --> 14:23.002
Send postcards
from exotic ports of call.

14:23.209 --> 14:26.508
That's what you call them, isn't it?
Exotic ports of call?

14:26.679 --> 14:29.307
A port's a port.

14:29.482 --> 14:31.416
You're exotic.

14:36.555 --> 14:38.489
Bye.

15:10.289 --> 15:13.315
Morning, Tommy.
It's early to be relieving me.

15:13.492 --> 15:16.086
Well, I felt our motion change.

15:17.196 --> 15:21.326
- Have we set a forward lookout in this?
- Yeah. Standing orders.

15:23.002 --> 15:26.130
Inform the captain
the foredeck's shipping water.

15:26.305 --> 15:28.466
Right. Do you wanna wake him up?

15:28.641 --> 15:33.340
The fleet radioed, we got a Russian
sub out there. We're to stay with it.

15:34.013 --> 15:38.382
Great. Give us a chance
to try out the depth charges.

15:38.584 --> 15:40.518
Yeah, that'II be the day.

15:40.686 --> 15:42.085
The last one.

15:42.254 --> 15:45.985
Forward watch is down!
Forward watch is down!

15:46.158 --> 15:48.319
He's gonna be swept over, sir!

15:51.664 --> 15:53.222
- Get the spot on him.
- Aye, sir.

15:53.399 --> 15:54.889
- Where is he?
- There he is!

15:55.067 --> 15:56.932
Hold on!

15:57.102 --> 15:59.161
Has he got a safety line on?

15:59.905 --> 16:01.896
Tommy!

16:02.241 --> 16:04.209
Sound the rescue party now!

16:07.880 --> 16:09.711
Help!

16:09.882 --> 16:13.147
Send the special rescue detail.
Forward lookout down.

16:13.319 --> 16:15.378
Tommy, wait for the rescue party!

16:15.554 --> 16:18.785
Send the special rescue detail.
Forward lookout down.

16:18.958 --> 16:21.859
Shit. Help me!

16:22.027 --> 16:25.326
Tommy, you don't have
a safety line on!

16:26.198 --> 16:29.463
- Keep the light on him.
- I'm trying, sir!

16:49.455 --> 16:51.389
Tommy!

16:57.730 --> 16:59.595
Keep the light on him!

16:59.765 --> 17:03.223
- It's too windy, sir!
- Hold on!

17:03.402 --> 17:06.496
Don't let him out of your sight.
Jesus!

17:17.715 --> 17:19.707
Help me.

17:36.802 --> 17:38.429
Hurry!

17:45.744 --> 17:48.304
He's got him.
He's got him!

17:48.981 --> 17:51.381
- We got him!
- Great!

18:15.541 --> 18:17.941
You've seen the leak
on the budget cuts?

18:18.110 --> 18:19.975
I've read the papers.
You're late.

18:20.145 --> 18:23.046
- Bad traffic.
- You should allow for that. I do.

18:23.215 --> 18:27.311
I've redlined the relevant sections
and my synopsis is at the end.

18:27.486 --> 18:30.250
Order breakfast.
Most important meal of the day.

18:30.422 --> 18:32.913
You should take
better care of yourself.

18:33.092 --> 18:35.788
- Menu, sir.
- Five years, 2 billion dollars.

18:35.961 --> 18:39.226
Gulf maritime can't even
get the prototype to float.

18:39.465 --> 18:44.061
The phantom sub is a sinkhole.
I'm not putting another dime into it.

18:44.236 --> 18:48.070
But what about the Armed
Services Committee? Duvall?

18:48.240 --> 18:51.107
One thing I look forward
to in this four years...

18:51.276 --> 18:53.836
...is putting that fraud
Duvall in his place.

18:54.980 --> 18:56.379
He's right back there.

18:57.182 --> 18:59.116
I know. Let's go.

19:04.657 --> 19:05.681
Oh, hi.

19:05.858 --> 19:08.088
Mr. Secretary Brice.
Good morning.

19:08.260 --> 19:10.626
- Senator, how are you?
- Mr. Secretary.

19:10.796 --> 19:15.256
We've been discussing that piece
on the budget in the paper.

19:15.434 --> 19:17.402
- Did you read it?
- Not yet.

19:17.569 --> 19:20.037
- Scott mentioned it.
- Mr. Pritchard.

19:20.205 --> 19:23.971
Where in heaven's name
do they get their information?

19:24.143 --> 19:27.237
And that idea about cutting back
on the phantom sub?

19:27.413 --> 19:30.507
It's groundless.
We were going over our options.

19:30.683 --> 19:32.583
Mr. Marshall says the Soviets...

19:32.751 --> 19:36.585
...are doing things with submarines
that will turn your hair white.

19:36.755 --> 19:40.851
You can rest assured I have no
intention of making a decision...

19:41.026 --> 19:44.359
...on this without consulting
you first. Good day.

19:44.563 --> 19:46.394
Good day, senator.

19:52.171 --> 19:53.468
You believe that?

19:54.373 --> 19:55.704
No.

19:59.144 --> 20:00.975
The car, please.

20:01.847 --> 20:05.977
Marshall was telling us if we fight
him, the CIA will be on his side.

20:06.151 --> 20:09.450
Of course. He pushed
Marshall for the directorship.

20:09.621 --> 20:11.919
I'm sorry.
Sometimes I'm short with you.

20:12.091 --> 20:15.060
- It's fine.
- A few months ago you introduced...

20:15.227 --> 20:17.627
...me to a friend of yours.
An officer.

20:17.796 --> 20:18.922
- Commander Farrell?
- Right.

20:19.098 --> 20:21.157
He has a background
in intelligence?

20:21.333 --> 20:26.270
- Two tours with naval intelligence.
- We could use a hero. Get him here.

20:27.506 --> 20:31.135
- His ship's in Manila.
- Just do it, please.

20:32.077 --> 20:36.537
No, no, no. You want--
Come here. You want a real hero.

20:37.983 --> 20:39.974
- You know you want to!
- Come on.

20:41.520 --> 20:44.580
- You're an officer.
- You're making it hard on me.

20:44.757 --> 20:47.191
You're making it hard on me.
They'II be there.

20:47.359 --> 20:49.691
- You know what I mean.
- What's that?

20:49.862 --> 20:52.160
- You deserve the damn medal.
- I carry?

20:52.331 --> 20:55.767
Jump me for promotion,
I'II kill you, your family, your pig.

20:55.934 --> 20:57.834
- I carry.
- What? You carry me?

20:58.003 --> 21:02.736
- No, I speak Filipino. Beat it, kid.
- He's gotta make a living. Don't run.

21:02.908 --> 21:06.105
- He's gonna run.
- If you run, I hurt you.

21:06.278 --> 21:08.906
He's running!

21:10.749 --> 21:12.080
Kid!

21:12.251 --> 21:14.412
John, forget it!

21:16.121 --> 21:17.986
No, let him go. Let him go.

21:18.157 --> 21:21.957
So what? He's got a toothbrush,
a pair of skivvies. So what?

21:22.127 --> 21:24.891
Okay. So, what do we do now?

21:25.063 --> 21:28.055
I don't know. I thought
I'd buy some ashtrays...

21:28.233 --> 21:31.430
...and take in some of
the local folk dancing.

21:31.603 --> 21:34.663
- Folk dancing?
- Yeah, folk dancing.

21:42.681 --> 21:45.172
No, person-to-person.

21:45.350 --> 21:48.717
You know, when you only pay
if you talk to the person?

21:48.887 --> 21:51.082
Shut up! Just shut up!
No, not you.

21:51.256 --> 21:53.451
- Groovy!
- No, I will pay.

21:53.625 --> 21:58.653
- First, I have to know if she's there.
- One, two, three, yeah!

22:00.165 --> 22:05.501
If I'm going to count out a million
pesos, I need to know if she's there.

22:05.671 --> 22:07.502
Yeah.

22:08.407 --> 22:13.868
That's my money. That's my money.
Go get it. Go get it.

22:16.014 --> 22:19.415
No, no, I'm not joking.
I'm an American.

22:23.689 --> 22:24.678
Hello?

22:24.857 --> 22:28.759
Yes. Connect. I'II take it.
I'm putting my money in now.

22:28.927 --> 22:33.023
Susan? Hello, Susan?

22:33.198 --> 22:35.723
Was I just--?

22:35.901 --> 22:39.302
Was I just disconnected?
Why? Why?

22:39.471 --> 22:42.099
I'm gonna show them how an American...

22:42.274 --> 22:45.334
...plants the flag
in a foreign fucking land!

22:45.510 --> 22:47.444
Yeah!

22:50.616 --> 22:53.608
Can I get a beer, please?
I'd like another beer.

22:53.785 --> 22:56.549
Wild thing!

23:08.800 --> 23:10.734
You're beautiful.

23:27.953 --> 23:31.081
- Hey, thanks.
- Keep it. Thank you.

23:44.836 --> 23:46.667
Hello, Tom! Welcome back.

23:46.838 --> 23:49.500
I have some mail for you.
Come in. Come in.

23:52.911 --> 23:57.541
The Philippines a romantic place, huh?
I painted a new painting.

23:57.716 --> 23:59.946
Christmas in New England.

24:00.652 --> 24:01.949
It's beautiful.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.281
You really like it?

24:04.456 --> 24:06.356
Well, it's unfinished.

24:06.525 --> 24:09.926
Will you be with us for a while?

24:10.095 --> 24:13.553
Yes, I'II be working
in the Pentagon again. Thank you.

24:13.732 --> 24:16.565
Great. It's always
a pleasure to have you back.

24:18.637 --> 24:20.332
Oh, my God!

24:21.740 --> 24:23.401
Hello.

24:24.376 --> 24:26.276
The Ancient Mariner.

24:26.445 --> 24:28.379
Not so ancient.

24:34.553 --> 24:36.418
I'm wasted!

24:36.855 --> 24:38.720
I can see.

24:41.193 --> 24:43.423
Wow, I'm so happy to see you!

24:43.595 --> 24:45.859
When did you get back?
Why didn't you call?

24:46.031 --> 24:47.589
- I did call.
- I wrote you.

24:47.766 --> 24:48.755
You did?

24:48.934 --> 24:51.869
I'm semiliterate,
so it was wastebasket time.

24:52.037 --> 24:55.097
If you caught gonorrhea,
I'II kill you.

25:04.116 --> 25:08.314
- I'm wearing too many clothes.
- It doesn't feel like it.

25:08.487 --> 25:11.923
Talk about feeling like
it's not wearing anything.

25:14.526 --> 25:18.018
- Oh. Oh, you're gonna blush.
- You are a very bad girl.

25:18.196 --> 25:20.221
Hold it.

25:20.399 --> 25:22.264
I mean the blush.

25:23.435 --> 25:25.369
God, I'm so embarrassed.

25:26.671 --> 25:28.263
What are you doing?

25:28.440 --> 25:30.271
- I want a picture.
- No pictures!

25:30.442 --> 25:33.138
Naval hero blushes.
Come on. You're proud.

25:33.311 --> 25:36.940
No, I'm not proud. I'm serious.

25:37.115 --> 25:40.915
- Don't take a picture of me, please.
- Come on.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.645
- Give me that.
- You jiggled the camera.

25:46.425 --> 25:48.359
You pervert.

25:57.069 --> 26:00.300
I think I did this way too early.

26:00.472 --> 26:04.306
It looks like a baboon
in a closet at midnight.

26:39.845 --> 26:41.745
Good morning. Go right in.

26:41.913 --> 26:44.882
- May I take your hat, sir?
- Thank you.

26:50.021 --> 26:51.613
Commander.

26:52.757 --> 26:55.885
- Glad to have you with us.
- It's nice to be here.

26:56.061 --> 26:58.359
Scott has a very high opinion of you.

26:58.530 --> 27:01.795
- Are you familiar with your new duties?
- No, sir.

27:02.767 --> 27:07.602
- Then this meeting is premature.
- Tom arrived in Washington yesterday.

27:07.772 --> 27:10.138
Well, since you're here....

27:10.308 --> 27:13.937
You'II function as liaison,
under Scott's supervision...

27:14.112 --> 27:18.276
...between this office
and the intelligence community.

27:18.617 --> 27:21.518
Calling those piranhas a "community"
is ironic.

27:21.686 --> 27:25.053
You'II meet with a representative
from all the agencies.

27:25.223 --> 27:28.488
For now, I am primarily
concerned with the CIA.

27:29.161 --> 27:32.130
- Sir?
- Are you aware of the phantom submarine?

27:32.297 --> 27:35.164
- Yes, sir.
- Have a seat.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.261
Thank you.

27:37.435 --> 27:42.270
It is supposed to be invisible to
sonar. The builder's first instinct--

27:42.440 --> 27:47.343
I should say his second instinct.
His first being to get his snout...

27:47.512 --> 27:49.639
...deep into the public trough.

27:49.814 --> 27:54.410
They want to build a submarine roughly
the size of an aircraft carrier.

27:54.586 --> 27:59.080
The Russians won't need sonar, they'II
just see this bulge in the ocean.

27:59.257 --> 28:01.248
I want to terminate this program.

28:01.426 --> 28:04.088
There's gonna be
congressional resistance...

28:04.262 --> 28:08.130
...principally from Senator Duvall.
Excuse me. Scott.

28:08.300 --> 28:10.928
What's worrying is
his connection to the CIA.

28:11.102 --> 28:14.003
We expect them to feed him
inflated estimates...

28:14.172 --> 28:16.197
...of Soviet research in the field.

28:16.374 --> 28:19.138
To counter him,
we need the same information.

28:19.311 --> 28:23.338
Not self-serving gloss, but the raw
data they base their conclusions on.

28:23.515 --> 28:25.847
- Your job is to get it.
- Yes, sir.

28:26.017 --> 28:29.214
But raw data from the CIA....
My experience--

28:29.387 --> 28:32.845
They'II give it to us or they won't.
If they do, I'm correct.

28:33.024 --> 28:36.516
If they do not, I will use that
against them with the president.

28:37.062 --> 28:39.826
- I'm speaking in complete candor.
- Yes, sir.

28:40.999 --> 28:43.968
Senator Duvall.

28:44.135 --> 28:49.072
Senator Duvall is motivated
by this absurd lust-- Sit down.

28:49.241 --> 28:51.300
This absurd lust for power.

28:51.476 --> 28:54.673
This would be comic if it wasn't
so damn dangerous.

28:54.846 --> 28:59.783
Marshall at the CIA is his....
Creature.

28:59.951 --> 29:04.445
You, as a career officer, are above
this political unpleasantness.

29:04.623 --> 29:07.990
- Yes, sir.
- Go with Scott and learn the background.

29:08.159 --> 29:10.650
- Yes, sir.
- Let's cut the protocol.

29:10.829 --> 29:15.129
Without a demurral, I'II assume
your responses are in the affirmative.

29:17.502 --> 29:20.300
Lorraine, get my wife
on the phone, please.

29:21.873 --> 29:24.307
I think he likes you.

29:26.011 --> 29:28.343
Okay, this is the situation room.

29:29.447 --> 29:32.507
And right this way, sir,
is the computer center.

29:34.986 --> 29:38.683
Did I mention, sir, I am very
pleased to be working for you?

29:38.857 --> 29:42.315
This is a Sperry 90/80.
The terminals in this room are for it.

29:42.494 --> 29:45.861
It interfaces with the IBM 370s
at NSA headquarters.

29:46.031 --> 29:48.226
It works programs
for Comsec, SIGINT...

29:48.400 --> 29:51.392
...the personnel command,
the Bureau of Alcohol and Fire--

29:51.569 --> 29:52.558
I get your gist.

29:52.737 --> 29:55.365
That's Dr. Hesselman,
the systems analyst.

29:55.440 --> 29:58.932
- I know who it is. Sam Hesselman.
- It's good to see you.

29:59.110 --> 30:01.044
Why didn't you call me
when you got in?

30:01.212 --> 30:04.375
- I don't know. Why didn't we call?
- Sir?

30:06.918 --> 30:10.115
You look great, Tom.
Come on in the office.

30:10.889 --> 30:12.823
- Mr. Fox, take a break.
- Yes, sir.

30:12.991 --> 30:14.185
Are you back for good?

30:14.359 --> 30:17.692
I don't know about "for good,"
but I'm here. How are you?

30:17.862 --> 30:18.851
Can't complain.

30:19.030 --> 30:21.897
- Helen and the kids asked about you.
- Good.

30:22.067 --> 30:24.900
The kids loved the ashtray.

30:25.070 --> 30:27.903
They didn't know
a donkey could do that.

30:28.373 --> 30:30.102
Come on.

30:34.512 --> 30:37.879
Tom, this is Kevin O'Brien.

30:38.049 --> 30:41.041
CIA. I've explained
you're taking over liaison.

30:41.219 --> 30:44.120
- Kevin will be your contact.
- Good to meet you.

30:44.289 --> 30:46.723
If I can help you settle in,
let me know.

30:46.891 --> 30:50.327
Right now I'm getting
my feet wet, trying to catch up.

30:50.495 --> 30:53.794
I thought because you didn't
want to wait until the meeting--

30:53.965 --> 30:57.492
I'm certain there are questions
Commander Farrell has.

30:57.669 --> 31:00.467
I'm not sufficiently
prepared to ask anything.

31:00.638 --> 31:02.970
I wouldn't want to waste your time.

31:03.441 --> 31:05.534
Well, then if you'II excuse me.

31:05.710 --> 31:07.371
Maybe there is one thing.

31:07.545 --> 31:11.072
The secretary asked me to
prepare him for the NATO meeting...

31:11.249 --> 31:14.776
...and I'd like to be familiar
with Russian intelligence estimates.

31:14.953 --> 31:17.649
We submit a report
on the first of the month.

31:17.822 --> 31:21.724
It'd be a big help if you could
send what you have as of now.

31:21.893 --> 31:23.383
I'II put something together.

31:23.561 --> 31:27.156
- Thanks. I'd appreciate it very much.
- Don't mention it.

31:32.137 --> 31:36.471
That was deftly handled.
For a moment there, I thought--

31:36.641 --> 31:41.044
Just trying to be subtle.
That's my job, isn't it?

32:01.199 --> 32:03.827
- Was this a present?
- Yeah.

32:04.903 --> 32:06.734
- He gave it to me.
- He did?

32:06.905 --> 32:09.703
He has expensive taste, this guy.

32:09.874 --> 32:12.206
Didn't cost anything.

32:12.377 --> 32:15.141
Some foreign minister gave it to him.

32:15.947 --> 32:18.415
So we're dealing here with a guy...

32:18.583 --> 32:21.313
...foreign ministers
give presents to?

32:21.486 --> 32:23.317
Don't start that stuff.

32:23.488 --> 32:25.683
I didn't say anything.

32:25.857 --> 32:28.087
You don't have to say anything.

32:28.259 --> 32:30.386
You never say a word.

32:31.496 --> 32:33.862
Well, I thought
I wasn't supposed to.

32:34.032 --> 32:35.863
You know what I mean.

32:36.034 --> 32:39.970
You get that wounded,
disapproving look on your face.

32:41.639 --> 32:43.800
Ask me a question, I'II answer it.

32:51.449 --> 32:55.613
It's David Brice,
secretary of defense. Satisfied?

33:00.892 --> 33:02.655
You know I work for Brice?

33:04.229 --> 33:06.129
Then that makes two of us.

33:08.666 --> 33:11.157
- Did you take care of everything?
- Yes.

33:11.336 --> 33:15.932
I'm supposed to pick Miss Atwell
up at 8:00, if she remembers.

33:16.107 --> 33:19.042
- You don't approve of Susan, do you?
- Sir?

33:20.645 --> 33:23.512
She's bright and exciting.
Can't you understand?

33:23.681 --> 33:26.013
Not exactly, I guess.

33:27.452 --> 33:30.046
All right. I'm a pain in the ass.

33:30.221 --> 33:33.918
But this one can do things
for me like no woman I've met.

33:36.928 --> 33:39.863
It's the only
other thing worth living for.

33:44.235 --> 33:49.036
- What is the big deal about tonight?
- He likes to see me in public.

33:49.207 --> 33:51.732
So, what does he get,
a secret hard-on?

33:51.910 --> 33:54.003
Try and understand.

33:54.979 --> 33:58.642
- I'II call you later tonight.
- I'II wait by the phone.

34:04.856 --> 34:07.620
- Hello, Scott.
- Hello, Miss Atwell.

34:53.036 --> 34:55.562
- Two white wines, please.
- Mr. Brice.

34:56.674 --> 35:01.737
Mr. Marshall and I have been having
a little debate on government service.

35:01.913 --> 35:05.508
Now, I claim that the fellow
with the appointed job...

35:05.683 --> 35:09.585
...well, he sort of comes
and he goes at the pleasure...

35:09.687 --> 35:13.453
...of this or that administration.
He blows in the wind.

35:13.625 --> 35:18.927
Whereas, the elected official,
well, he serves the people directly.

35:19.030 --> 35:21.965
He has to be more responsible.

35:22.066 --> 35:24.466
What do you think, Mr. Secretary?

35:24.535 --> 35:28.972
Senator Duvall,
I think it's getting very late.

35:35.113 --> 35:37.411
- Oh, yes. Thanks.
- Thank you.

35:46.691 --> 35:50.525
Who's that man licking Duvall's ear?
I recognize him.

35:50.695 --> 35:55.291
I would hope so. That's Marshall.
He's the director of the CIA.

35:55.366 --> 35:57.425
You would hope so.

36:06.978 --> 36:08.912
No, thank you.

36:22.060 --> 36:24.028
Commander.

36:24.095 --> 36:27.496
- So nice you could make it.
- Thank you, sir.

36:36.674 --> 36:39.973
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.

36:40.078 --> 36:44.447
It's very good of you to come and
help us celebrate our national day.

36:44.515 --> 36:48.576
After all, we're a small country,
far away.

36:48.653 --> 36:51.850
We've got entertainment
for you this evening...

36:51.956 --> 36:54.151
...which I'm sure you'II enjoy.

37:01.966 --> 37:04.526
I'II be right back.

37:38.970 --> 37:40.801
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:40.972 --> 37:42.940
You're going away?

37:43.341 --> 37:47.903
- Just for the weekend.
- Perhaps a romantic interlude, yes?

37:47.979 --> 37:49.241
Perhaps.

37:49.947 --> 37:53.474
If I intrude on your privacy,
for this I am sorry.

37:54.619 --> 37:57.816
It's not just a job,
it's an adventure.

38:19.410 --> 38:20.741
What are you eating?

38:20.812 --> 38:24.213
- You're eating bugs?
- I gotta have another one.

38:26.551 --> 38:30.078
- Here you go.
- That is really disgusting.

38:36.227 --> 38:39.219
I love Tom Farrell!

38:39.297 --> 38:43.700
Yes, I do! Yes, I do! Yes, I do!

38:43.768 --> 38:46.931
Hold on!

38:59.817 --> 39:01.341
Thank you.

39:11.696 --> 39:14.221
- Thank you very much.
- Take care of us.

39:14.298 --> 39:16.163
I will. You guys newlyweds?

39:16.334 --> 39:18.962
- You can go.
- Thank you.

39:20.438 --> 39:22.269
You're beautiful.

39:22.440 --> 39:25.034
- Mr. and Mrs. Smith?
- A romantic gesture.

39:27.378 --> 39:29.369
How very original.

39:29.547 --> 39:32.107
I spelled it with a Y.

39:42.793 --> 39:44.727
- Hi.
- Hey, there.

39:45.796 --> 39:47.730
We want to rent a boat.

39:49.200 --> 39:53.466
- Twenty bucks an hour. Take your pick.
- We don't want a plastic toy.

39:53.537 --> 39:55.334
We want something like this.

39:55.506 --> 39:57.497
- No, no.
- Why not?

39:57.608 --> 40:00.372
That's my boss's boat.
It ain't for rent.

40:00.544 --> 40:02.978
Well, I want it.

40:04.115 --> 40:06.743
Don't do this.

40:06.918 --> 40:10.217
You're bad. Do you really
know what you're doing?

40:10.388 --> 40:14.051
It's gusting like a son of a bitch
out there. One more.

40:27.638 --> 40:31.301
God, I wish the Navy
were still like this.

40:34.078 --> 40:37.013
Let's get ready,
we'II come about.

40:42.286 --> 40:45.278
- Give me a kiss.
- Okay, hold the fort.

40:45.423 --> 40:47.948
We're gonna come here.
Let me get it off.

40:48.025 --> 40:50.118
- Ready?
- No, not yet.

40:51.228 --> 40:53.560
- Okay, whenever you are.
- I'm ready.

40:53.631 --> 40:55.963
- Say, "Helms alee."
- Helms alee!

40:56.033 --> 40:58.058
Very tight.

41:43.047 --> 41:44.412
Hello?

41:44.482 --> 41:46.746
Oh, hi, Nina.

41:46.817 --> 41:49.445
Tom and I just got back this minute.

41:52.823 --> 41:54.950
Okay.

41:55.426 --> 41:56.950
Yeah.

41:57.962 --> 42:00.226
Can I call you later?

42:00.598 --> 42:02.691
Okay.

42:04.268 --> 42:06.202
Bye.

42:07.872 --> 42:11.273
Well, it didn't
take him long, did it?

42:12.009 --> 42:13.977
That was Nina, so don't.

42:14.945 --> 42:16.310
Don't what?

42:56.620 --> 42:58.019
Oh, no.

42:58.189 --> 43:01.716
Tom, David's here.
Oh, my God.

43:03.861 --> 43:06.523
I'm begging you.
Go now, out the back door.

43:07.331 --> 43:08.798
I'm sorry. Just--

43:08.966 --> 43:11.867
When I go, it'II be
through the front door.

43:12.870 --> 43:17.705
As a favor to me, just this one time.
Please! Please go!

43:17.808 --> 43:21.266
I promise I'II work everything out.
All right?

43:21.879 --> 43:23.870
Tom, please!

43:24.348 --> 43:27.943
Why don't you fucking go down
and beg him not to come in?

43:31.288 --> 43:34.086
You want me to say it?
I'II say it.

43:36.861 --> 43:40.558
Tom. I'II leave him.
I promise, I will.

43:40.731 --> 43:42.858
I'II leave him.

43:43.634 --> 43:45.932
I love you.

44:35.920 --> 44:38.354
You've been out of town.

44:40.791 --> 44:43.259
And you have a pleasant flush.

44:43.427 --> 44:46.055
- I got some sun.
- Oh, how nice.

44:46.230 --> 44:48.721
- With whom did you get this sun?
- What?

44:48.899 --> 44:52.596
What? I said, who were you
with this weekend?

44:52.770 --> 44:55.068
Nobody.

44:56.473 --> 45:01.001
I find that hard to believe, that
you'd go away completely alone.

45:01.178 --> 45:03.112
I didn't say I was alone.

45:03.180 --> 45:05.444
You said you weren't with anybody.

45:07.718 --> 45:09.811
I mean, nobody you know.

45:10.888 --> 45:12.879
I know a great many people.

45:12.957 --> 45:15.824
How do you know
it's somebody I don't know?

45:20.030 --> 45:21.964
You want a drink?

45:24.668 --> 45:26.568
He's a man I know.

45:28.672 --> 45:31.106
It's of no importance.

45:34.044 --> 45:37.377
It may be of no importance to you
whom you sleep with...

45:37.448 --> 45:39.473
...but it's of importance to me!

45:39.650 --> 45:41.709
Why worry? There's plenty left.

45:42.653 --> 45:48.023
Get out of here, you bastard! Get out!
I'm calling the police. Get out!

45:48.492 --> 45:50.084
I wanna know who it was.

45:54.331 --> 45:57.198
Listen, goddamn it!
I pay the rent here.

45:57.268 --> 45:59.429
Get out of here!

46:00.771 --> 46:04.036
All right, wait.
Wait a minute.

46:04.208 --> 46:06.506
I'm sorry I slapped you, all right?

46:09.913 --> 46:12.347
- No! Damn it!
- Listen!

46:13.217 --> 46:14.514
- You tell me--
- No!

46:14.585 --> 46:18.487
- You tell me who it is!
- He's not a pig like you!

46:28.866 --> 46:29.924
Susan!

46:45.649 --> 46:48.709
David, what's the matter?

46:55.726 --> 46:57.626
I think I killed Susan.

47:01.131 --> 47:04.726
- What happened?
- I killed her.

47:08.772 --> 47:12.037
I needed somebody to talk
to before I go to the police.

47:12.176 --> 47:14.474
Sit down. Sit down.

47:16.313 --> 47:19.339
It was an accident.
I didn't mean to.

47:19.516 --> 47:23.816
She was with some man,
and I just must've gone crazy.

47:24.888 --> 47:28.654
The man was there?
He saw you?

47:31.962 --> 47:34.328
He saw me go in, yeah.

47:35.232 --> 47:37.325
Who is he?

47:39.036 --> 47:40.970
It was dark.

47:42.139 --> 47:44.664
Then maybe he didn't see you.

47:45.809 --> 47:49.074
I parked my car.
I stood under the light.

47:50.147 --> 47:52.115
He saw me.

47:52.282 --> 47:54.216
He saw me.

48:49.673 --> 48:52.699
Hi. I can't come
to the phone right now...

48:52.810 --> 48:56.837
...but when you hear the beep,
tell me everything.

49:12.162 --> 49:15.962
- Did she ever photograph you?
- No.

49:19.136 --> 49:22.697
This is the negative side of
a Polaroid. It was under the bed.

49:22.873 --> 49:24.704
Are you absolutely certain?

49:24.875 --> 49:28.038
I'm certain. I'm not that big a fool.

49:28.612 --> 49:31.206
Then we have to find
the man who saw you.

49:34.818 --> 49:40.381
What if the search for this man
was of vital national security?

49:40.457 --> 49:44.791
A secret operation
that we could control.

49:45.762 --> 49:47.161
It won't hold up.

49:47.331 --> 49:49.492
We'II invent an excuse to justify it.

49:49.566 --> 49:53.593
The important thing is to abort
an investigation of her death...

49:53.670 --> 49:55.103
...before it gets to you.

49:55.172 --> 49:58.972
No. It's a house of cards.
There is no Yuri.

49:59.109 --> 50:02.306
It doesn't matter.
All the intelligence agencies...

50:02.379 --> 50:05.974
...believe that there's a mole
in the defense department.

50:06.149 --> 50:07.912
You know the theory.

50:07.985 --> 50:11.887
Yuri was sent here by the KGB
while he was in his teens...

50:12.055 --> 50:15.388
...and for all purposes,
he can pass as an American.

50:15.459 --> 50:20.726
It's the CIA's wet dream.
There's never been any evidence.

50:20.797 --> 50:23.789
But now there is.

50:23.967 --> 50:27.733
He was the man who spent
the weekend with Susan.

50:27.905 --> 50:30.430
He was the man who killed her.

50:36.313 --> 50:41.546
Lorraine, will you ask CID
to get all the material on Yuri...

50:41.718 --> 50:47.247
...and bring it in to the secretary
as soon as possible? Thank you.

50:47.424 --> 50:51.656
- I don't think we can bring this off.
- You can.

50:57.701 --> 50:59.635
Excuse me.

51:02.739 --> 51:05.333
- Good morning, major.
- Morning.

51:05.509 --> 51:07.443
Thank you.

51:10.614 --> 51:15.608
If military intelligence can catch
this KGB agent without assistance...

51:15.786 --> 51:19.017
...it will strengthen us
against the CIA. Thank you.

51:19.089 --> 51:21.956
This has to move like lightning.

51:22.025 --> 51:25.324
We have to finish before anyone
knows what we're doing.

51:25.395 --> 51:29.661
Control the investigation.
Responsibility is consonant with you.

51:29.733 --> 51:33.294
I have implicit trust in you
to keep this under wraps.

51:33.370 --> 51:36.498
You're to report to me
or to Secretary Brice only.

51:36.573 --> 51:40.009
- I will be here around the clock.
- What do the police know?

51:40.143 --> 51:44.637
They haven't been informed. CID has
taken the body to Fort Meade.

51:45.816 --> 51:50.583
If we go looking for a spy without
the FBI or the CIA, it'II raise hell.

51:50.654 --> 51:53.122
That's my problem.

51:56.693 --> 51:59.685
What do we have
on the dead woman?

52:00.497 --> 52:04.763
It's through Yuri's association with
this woman that we'II find him.

52:04.835 --> 52:08.271
Here's everything we know
about her for the moment.

52:09.506 --> 52:12.031
He spent the weekend
with her somewhere.

52:12.109 --> 52:16.307
Then he brought her home and killed
her sometime around midnight.

52:16.380 --> 52:19.816
It shouldn't be hard to find out
where they'd been.

52:28.091 --> 52:29.718
Tom?

52:30.727 --> 52:32.194
Yeah. Yes.

52:32.262 --> 52:34.389
The investigation
will develop material--

52:34.464 --> 52:36.523
Will you excuse me?

52:37.567 --> 52:41.264
- Commander Farrell, are we boring you?
- No, sir. May I?

53:01.925 --> 53:04.393
We can't even convince
our own people.

53:04.461 --> 53:06.486
It's all right.

53:39.463 --> 53:41.988
Get Donovan in here.

53:42.466 --> 53:44.058
Commander, if you please!

53:59.516 --> 54:01.143
Commander?

54:03.253 --> 54:06.120
This is Major Donovan
of criminal investigation.

54:06.289 --> 54:09.190
His men will conduct the
investigation on your orders.

54:09.359 --> 54:10.348
Major.

54:10.427 --> 54:13.260
We're down in the situation room,
commander.

54:28.445 --> 54:31.005
We have to have a front man.

54:36.920 --> 54:40.549
- They're autopsying the body.
- I wanna see her apartment.

54:40.624 --> 54:43.957
- That's not necessary.
- I want to see it.

54:44.027 --> 54:46.621
- They're autopsying the body now.
- Good.

54:46.696 --> 54:49.529
- I wanna see her apartment.
- Mr. Pritchard--

54:49.699 --> 54:52.759
It's more important
that you remain here.

54:52.836 --> 54:55.669
I've got men checking
for physical evidence.

54:55.739 --> 54:58.469
- The print people are back.
- What did they find?

54:58.542 --> 55:01.875
Fragments of smudge.
The place was clean.

55:02.512 --> 55:04.412
What's going on?

55:04.481 --> 55:07.075
A matter of the utmost importance.

55:07.150 --> 55:08.139
What is this?

55:08.218 --> 55:12.416
We're checking calls from the week,
to see if her number comes up.

55:12.489 --> 55:16.585
- There's gotta be millions.
- We interface with the phone company.

55:16.660 --> 55:19.993
We're monitoring every call made
in a 50-mile radius.

55:20.096 --> 55:23.395
We're checking restaurant
and hotel credit card receipts.

55:23.466 --> 55:26.902
- Who is this bimbo anyway?
- She's dead.

55:28.704 --> 55:31.502
One billfold.

55:31.674 --> 55:33.767
- Bracelets.
- This is from her house?

55:33.943 --> 55:36.173
Yes, sir.

55:36.345 --> 55:38.279
One box of candy mints.

55:41.617 --> 55:44.177
Got one brown hairbrush.

55:51.894 --> 55:56.058
Commander Farrell is on his way in.
We'II have a report soon.

55:56.232 --> 55:59.497
- What's this?
- Polaroid negatives.

56:00.670 --> 56:03.434
- I can't make anything out.
- Excuse me.

56:03.606 --> 56:07.804
If there's silver on the emulsion,
we may be able get the picture.

56:07.977 --> 56:12.573
Excuse me. Sergeant, get this
right over to the photo lab, huh?

56:12.815 --> 56:15.113
- Sir. Commander.
- Yes?

56:15.284 --> 56:17.377
Mr. O'Brien's in your office.

56:17.553 --> 56:20.386
We made an appointment
to go over the CIA report.

56:20.556 --> 56:25.050
- Just cancel it.
- If we do, he'II go away suspicious.

56:25.227 --> 56:27.161
That's true.

56:31.634 --> 56:34.626
Hello. I'II be in
Commander Farrell's office...

56:34.804 --> 56:37.864
...could you call me in five minutes?

56:38.140 --> 56:41.166
Sorry it took so long.

56:41.344 --> 56:43.835
- This is the official estimate.
- It's an advance copy.

56:44.013 --> 56:46.709
I thought that was what you wanted.

56:47.049 --> 56:49.210
Pritchard here.

56:49.385 --> 56:54.015
Yes, of course. I'm sorry,
I'm wanted in the secretary's office.

56:54.190 --> 56:57.250
I suggest that we
reschedule this meeting.

56:57.426 --> 57:00.361
Perhaps Commander Farrell
and I could continue.

57:00.529 --> 57:02.292
- Commander Farrell--
- Sure.

57:02.465 --> 57:07.459
We're both requested at the secretary's
meeting. I'm afraid we must stop.

57:08.804 --> 57:13.434
Kevin, I was wondering if you might
help me in the counterespionage area.

57:13.609 --> 57:16.976
Tom, we'd better get to that meeting.

57:19.682 --> 57:23.846
Commander, when you get
more time, you give me a call.

57:24.020 --> 57:26.454
I can be reached
24 hours a day.

57:26.856 --> 57:28.289
Good.

57:30.993 --> 57:35.259
- What was that supposed to be?
- I might get something about Yuri.

57:35.431 --> 57:38.662
What we have will be
quite sufficient.

57:39.535 --> 57:42.026
Arrange that all outgoing
calls are monitored.

57:42.204 --> 57:44.536
- All calls?
- Brice's lines are safe.

57:44.707 --> 57:46.038
- I'II see to it.
- Now.

57:47.043 --> 57:48.772
- What's that?
- Autopsy report.

57:48.944 --> 57:53.472
She died of a broken neck.
Here's a list of her stomach contents.

57:53.649 --> 57:55.446
What the hell for?

57:55.618 --> 57:58.052
There are chemical
pollutants in food.

57:58.220 --> 58:02.179
There's a chance we might pin down
where she ate her last day.

58:11.767 --> 58:15.601
Stay close to things. Do nothing
until you're instructed by me.

58:15.771 --> 58:18.797
- Who are these goons?
- They're associated with Special Forces.

58:18.974 --> 58:23.877
- What's that mean, "associated"?
- That means exactly what I said.

58:24.046 --> 58:28.142
- They were formerly in Special Forces.
- Honduras? El Salvador?

58:28.317 --> 58:32.413
- Somewhere down there.
- Were you with the death squads?

58:32.588 --> 58:34.647
- It's possible.
- They're assassins.

58:34.824 --> 58:39.284
You needn't concern yourself. They work
for me now. Leave us, please!

58:48.804 --> 58:51.830
You haven't told me everything.

59:02.151 --> 59:04.176
The Atwell woman knew Brice.

59:05.788 --> 59:07.722
She was his mistress.

59:09.525 --> 59:14.292
Naturally, Brice had no idea
of her connection with a Soviet agent.

59:14.463 --> 59:16.988
We found out last night,
after the murder.

59:17.166 --> 59:20.829
Brice is in an impossible situation.
We should call in the FBI.

59:21.003 --> 59:23.665
Don't be an idiot.

59:24.140 --> 59:27.541
Do you realize the magnitude
of the scandal?

59:27.710 --> 59:30.076
The secretary of defense
and a Soviet agent...

59:30.279 --> 59:33.146
...sharing the favors
of a murdered whore.

59:33.315 --> 59:35.749
David might be
a suspect in the killing.

59:35.918 --> 59:38.546
I think that's something to consider.

59:38.721 --> 59:42.817
Tom, Brice was with me in my apartment
at the time of the murder.

59:42.992 --> 59:46.621
- He couldn't have done it.
- Let Brice take his chances.

59:46.796 --> 59:51.927
That decision is not yours to make.
What we will do is catch this Yuri...

59:52.101 --> 59:55.195
...before anyone knows
what's happened. We'II handle it.

59:55.371 --> 01:00:00.001
- You mean the gentlemen in that room.
- The man is a spy and a murderer.

01:00:00.176 --> 01:00:03.145
- Would anyone deny justice was done?
- I would.

01:00:03.312 --> 01:00:06.042
We shall have that
discussion, but for now...

01:00:06.215 --> 01:00:10.447
...I expect you to follow orders and
demonstrate the personal loyalty...

01:00:10.619 --> 01:00:12.712
...to which we have every right.

01:00:12.888 --> 01:00:16.119
- You expect a lot.
- I depend on you. We're friends.

01:00:16.292 --> 01:00:19.591
And, Tom, if it were
your intention to do...

01:00:19.762 --> 01:00:23.027
...anything to bring
down David Brice...

01:00:23.199 --> 01:00:28.193
...I'd have no choice but to make
sure that you didn't get away with it.

01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:31.862
- Thank you for the warning.
- I'm certain it's unnecessary.

01:00:32.041 --> 01:00:36.205
You'II see that we're following
the only possible course.

01:00:52.228 --> 01:00:56.096
I gave them the estimates.
They couldn't have cared less.

01:00:58.133 --> 01:01:00.658
Get me Senator Duvall.

01:01:02.738 --> 01:01:05.935
What's this top-secret business
I've heard about at the Pentagon?

01:01:06.108 --> 01:01:09.703
Here's what we do have.
CID is running a phone check.

01:01:09.879 --> 01:01:13.178
They're looking for calls
placed to a Susan Atwell.

01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:14.577
Who is she?

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:18.277
She's in the morgue at Fort Meade.
She was murdered.

01:01:18.454 --> 01:01:20.615
- We know anything about it?
- Get ready.

01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:25.283
We think she's either David Brice's
or Scott Pritchard's mistress.

01:01:25.461 --> 01:01:29.329
She was seen with both of them.
It didn't seem high-priority...

01:01:29.498 --> 01:01:32.331
...so my people have been
lax in following it up.

01:01:32.501 --> 01:01:37.029
Well, split milk, and you can forget
about Pritchard. He's homosexual.

01:01:38.941 --> 01:01:40.169
I'II be damned.

01:01:41.677 --> 01:01:45.078
So will he, if you believe
the Old Testament. Who killed her?

01:01:45.247 --> 01:01:49.377
We don't know. They got CID
believing they're searching for Yuri.

01:01:50.352 --> 01:01:53.219
Don't tell me anybody swallowed that.

01:01:54.523 --> 01:01:57.356
That poor son of a bitch Brice.

01:01:58.827 --> 01:02:01.853
You know, I almost feel sorry for him.

01:02:02.031 --> 01:02:05.592
- Who's running this at the Pentagon?
- The new boy, Farrell.

01:02:05.768 --> 01:02:08.202
So he can take the fall.

01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:12.898
This morning, he looked like a man
who'd like to have a heart-to-heart.

01:02:13.809 --> 01:02:18.109
Yeah. Senator Duvall.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.340
Billy, I've been hearing
some disturbing news...

01:02:21.517 --> 01:02:23.314
...about the phantom sub.

01:02:25.354 --> 01:02:28.755
I tried to talk
to the president about NATO.

01:02:29.191 --> 01:02:31.682
He wanted to talk about
the phantom sub.

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:34.328
Why the crunch has
come now is beyond me.

01:02:34.496 --> 01:02:39.399
- We'II just have to handle it.
- You got me handling a hell of a lot.

01:02:40.502 --> 01:02:43.232
Yeah? Hold.

01:02:43.405 --> 01:02:46.966
Commander, line two,
the other phone.

01:02:47.142 --> 01:02:49.133
I'II call you back.

01:02:49.311 --> 01:02:51.245
Yeah?

01:02:52.314 --> 01:02:54.646
I'II be right down.

01:02:54.817 --> 01:02:58.947
- They want me in the computer center.
- I'II go with you.

01:02:59.121 --> 01:03:02.147
Oh, yeah, by all means, go with him.

01:03:05.694 --> 01:03:08.162
- What is it?
- Lab said there's no more image...

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:10.798
...they can get out of this Polaroid.

01:03:10.966 --> 01:03:14.163
Damn, too much to hope for.
We'II have to forget it.

01:03:14.336 --> 01:03:18.170
Maybe not. There's something
I want to show you.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:21.170
Now, this is as bad
as your Polaroid, right?

01:03:21.343 --> 01:03:25.473
Now watch. This is a training tape.
I'm speeding it up.

01:03:25.681 --> 01:03:28.115
The picture is broken
down into pixels.

01:03:28.283 --> 01:03:32.583
That's the smallest element on
the emulsion. An atom of the picture.

01:03:32.755 --> 01:03:35.986
This is the good part.
The computer asks itself:

01:03:36.158 --> 01:03:38.718
What would be next to what?

01:03:38.894 --> 01:03:40.521
That's all there is to it?

01:03:40.696 --> 01:03:44.826
We have to keep on top of the
computer. Computers don't think.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.094
If we had programmed
this to come out a car...

01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:52.297
...well, right now, you'd be
looking at a hairy Buick.

01:03:52.775 --> 01:03:55.141
- Just get started on it.
- Wait a minute.

01:03:55.310 --> 01:03:59.872
It takes billions of calculations.
It may take 12 hours or a week.

01:04:00.049 --> 01:04:02.847
Well, that's too long.

01:04:03.018 --> 01:04:06.647
You can get what you need
from the work in progress.

01:04:06.822 --> 01:04:08.346
We'II watch it on this.

01:04:08.557 --> 01:04:11.754
We've got a phone number
listed to a Nina Beka.

01:04:11.927 --> 01:04:14.589
She called at about
the time of the murder.

01:04:14.763 --> 01:04:18.995
- I better see her.
- I was just about to send my men.

01:04:34.416 --> 01:04:37.214
Are you Miss Nina Beka?

01:04:37.853 --> 01:04:38.842
Yes.

01:04:39.054 --> 01:04:42.353
I'm Commander Farrell.
This is Mr. Scott Pritchard...

01:04:42.524 --> 01:04:46.824
...general counsel to the secretary
of defense. May we come in?

01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:49.463
Please, do come in.

01:04:50.933 --> 01:04:55.666
I'm afraid that we have
some bad news for you.

01:04:57.206 --> 01:05:01.609
A woman named Susan Atwell is dead.

01:05:04.179 --> 01:05:06.545
She was a friend of yours?

01:05:06.982 --> 01:05:09.644
Yes, she is.

01:05:09.818 --> 01:05:12.286
In what way were you acquainted?

01:05:19.194 --> 01:05:24.928
You see, I work at
Shalini's Boutique in the pavilion.

01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:27.864
She used to come
in there sometimes.

01:05:28.036 --> 01:05:30.937
Tell us as much about her as possible.

01:05:31.106 --> 01:05:34.542
We think she was killed
by a man she'd been seeing.

01:05:35.911 --> 01:05:38.846
- Why?
- You needn't concern yourself with why.

01:05:39.014 --> 01:05:43.075
We just need to know the names
of the men she consorted with.

01:05:43.252 --> 01:05:46.653
- Consorted with?
- Yes.

01:05:47.122 --> 01:05:49.590
I don't know about Susan's life.

01:05:49.758 --> 01:05:53.558
I'II ask you again,
who were the men she saw?

01:05:54.062 --> 01:05:59.022
Ask 1000 times, and the answer
will be the same: I don't know it.

01:06:00.502 --> 01:06:02.561
You're South African.

01:06:03.839 --> 01:06:06.501
- That's right.
- I don't see a U.S. visa.

01:06:06.675 --> 01:06:09.542
You're an illegal alien.

01:06:13.749 --> 01:06:16.081
Do you know who I am?

01:06:16.652 --> 01:06:21.715
I can pick up that phone and have you
on the first plane to Johannesburg.

01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:25.656
I'm assuming you have a reason
for not wanting to be there.

01:06:28.897 --> 01:06:33.664
You guessed right.
I know who you are.

01:06:33.835 --> 01:06:37.236
I know who Brice is. David Brice.

01:06:37.406 --> 01:06:41.866
- Is that the name you're looking for?
- It's another man that we want.

01:06:42.511 --> 01:06:47.505
Well, in that case,
why don't we make a deal?

01:06:47.683 --> 01:06:50.481
We'II talk about it.
Who is the other man?

01:06:55.357 --> 01:06:57.951
Who is the other man?

01:07:01.129 --> 01:07:03.791
It's someone at the Pentagon.

01:07:06.435 --> 01:07:11.566
- Does he have a name?
- I suppose so, but I don't know it.

01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:14.231
Listen...

01:07:14.409 --> 01:07:19.870
...all I know is that Susan used
to see him, and he reappeared.

01:07:20.048 --> 01:07:22.107
- How recently?
- I don't know.

01:07:22.284 --> 01:07:24.149
- Three months? Two?
- I don't know!

01:07:24.319 --> 01:07:26.844
Three weeks. Who cares?
I don't know it.

01:07:27.022 --> 01:07:30.583
Listen, she never discussed
these things with me.

01:07:30.759 --> 01:07:37.028
All right, we're going to close the part
of the investigation that concerns you.

01:07:39.167 --> 01:07:43.001
- Tom.
- Thank you, Miss Beka.

01:07:43.205 --> 01:07:45.002
You've been very helpful.

01:07:56.385 --> 01:07:58.182
Sam!

01:07:58.353 --> 01:08:03.950
I want the names of personnel assigned
to the Pentagon in the past two months.

01:08:04.126 --> 01:08:06.924
I just have to set up
a program to find it.

01:08:07.095 --> 01:08:08.585
Mr. Pritchard.

01:08:08.764 --> 01:08:12.996
Tom, I've got a suggestion.
We're doing this credit card search...

01:08:13.168 --> 01:08:17.161
...but it's extremely unlikely
anything would be in so soon.

01:08:17.339 --> 01:08:19.636
We're wasting time
that we could use better.

01:08:19.808 --> 01:08:23.801
- I know. I want you to keep on with it.
- What's all this about?

01:08:23.979 --> 01:08:27.243
- We'II talk later. What is this?
- I have to see Brice.

01:08:27.416 --> 01:08:30.249
Get started on that
list of new employees.

01:08:30.419 --> 01:08:35.185
Yeah, we isolated three pollutants
in the dead girl's stomach contents.

01:08:35.357 --> 01:08:38.019
The red, green and blue
lines on the graph.

01:08:38.193 --> 01:08:42.720
If we can get the overlays to match,
we might pinpoint where she was.

01:08:42.898 --> 01:08:46.527
So far, it looks like somewhere
near upper Chesapeake Bay.

01:08:54.810 --> 01:08:56.470
Come in.

01:08:57.479 --> 01:08:59.912
Excuse me, have you
seen Major Donovan?

01:09:00.082 --> 01:09:03.245
- No.
- It's important that I get this to him.

01:09:03.417 --> 01:09:08.048
- What do you have here?
- We missed it the first time around.

01:09:08.223 --> 01:09:11.488
It must have fallen
under the seat of her car.

01:09:11.926 --> 01:09:13.417
I'II take care of this.

01:09:15.130 --> 01:09:17.098
Very well, sir.

01:09:21.636 --> 01:09:23.433
Was this a present?

01:09:23.638 --> 01:09:27.836
- Yeah, he gave it to me.
- He has expensive taste.

01:09:28.009 --> 01:09:32.673
It didn't cost him anything.
Some foreign minister gave it to him.

01:09:33.915 --> 01:09:39.581
I pride myself on being a man
of forbearance and conciliation...

01:09:39.755 --> 01:09:43.122
...but if you fuck me on this,
I'II crucify you!

01:09:43.325 --> 01:09:45.189
I am not your rubber stamp.

01:09:45.627 --> 01:09:48.823
You have run roughshod
over this office. It's over.

01:09:48.997 --> 01:09:52.296
You may disparage
your predecessors all you like...

01:09:52.466 --> 01:09:55.698
...but I don't recall any
secret investigation...

01:09:55.871 --> 01:09:58.362
...that required the
Department of Defense...

01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:02.840
...circumvented CIA and the FBI
and the Washington police.

01:10:03.011 --> 01:10:06.640
We're not locked into any position
on the phantom sub.

01:10:06.815 --> 01:10:09.340
What are you saying?
I'm trying to allay...

01:10:09.551 --> 01:10:12.042
...his fears that
we act peremptorily.

01:10:12.254 --> 01:10:14.654
We will act the way
I decide on this matter.

01:10:15.056 --> 01:10:18.924
Gentlemen, I don't see any point
in squabbling like children.

01:10:19.528 --> 01:10:24.056
Mr. Pritchard, I'm encouraged by your
attitude. I'm sure your investigation...

01:10:24.232 --> 01:10:27.668
...whatever it is,
is perfectly proper.

01:10:27.836 --> 01:10:30.464
I must apologize
for my unseemly outburst.

01:10:30.639 --> 01:10:33.164
It's just that I've been
sorely troubled.

01:10:33.341 --> 01:10:36.208
That's perfectly
understandable, senator.

01:10:36.378 --> 01:10:41.782
- We can reach an accommodation.
- Gentlemen, I'm deeply gratified.

01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:45.579
Deeply gratified, and I hope
you'II forgive my imposition...

01:10:45.754 --> 01:10:49.417
...on such a busy day.

01:10:57.299 --> 01:11:01.133
- He's got us.
- This is insane. It's out of control.

01:11:01.303 --> 01:11:03.396
Your cover story's
not gonna hold.

01:11:03.572 --> 01:11:07.531
Yes, it will, but you have
to have more moral courage.

01:11:14.416 --> 01:11:19.046
Have you ever heard
of a woman named Nina Beka?

01:11:19.521 --> 01:11:24.151
- No.
- Well, she's heard of you.

01:11:25.927 --> 01:11:28.725
Instruct the CIA to get
in touch with you.

01:11:28.897 --> 01:11:32.298
Remain there and wait for information.
Do not call me.

01:11:32.467 --> 01:11:34.264
- I'II check in with you.
- Yes.

01:11:34.469 --> 01:11:36.903
- As quickly as possible.
- Okay.

01:11:43.512 --> 01:11:46.276
Hey! You two!

01:11:50.485 --> 01:11:52.680
Scott, where are they going?

01:11:52.854 --> 01:11:54.754
- Where are they going?
- Who's that?

01:11:54.923 --> 01:11:59.019
- You know who I mean, the bookends.
- I sent them on an errand.

01:12:02.097 --> 01:12:04.895
Tom. Tom. Tom!

01:12:05.066 --> 01:12:06.931
Yes, sir, I'II--

01:12:09.204 --> 01:12:11.764
- I need a car.
- CID's got everything.

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:14.875
- This one.
- You can't take that, lift's busted.

01:12:15.043 --> 01:12:17.477
- The man's gonna fix it.
- Watch your toes.

01:12:17.646 --> 01:12:21.013
Come on! Get out of there!
Get outta there right now!

01:12:37.832 --> 01:12:39.197
Shit.

01:13:10.365 --> 01:13:12.526
- Shit.
- Hi.

01:13:21.710 --> 01:13:25.146
- Goddamn it, get him!
- Come on, hurry up!

01:13:26.581 --> 01:13:29.482
Hey, what are you doing?
Are you crazy?

01:14:37.819 --> 01:14:39.787
Hey, you okay?

01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:14.513
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, slow down!

01:15:30.905 --> 01:15:33.738
Look out!

01:15:34.175 --> 01:15:37.406
Hey, you almost killed a guy here!

01:15:40.849 --> 01:15:43.841
I'm gonna get you, motherfucker!

01:16:31.432 --> 01:16:34.094
- Nina, come with me.
- Tom.

01:16:34.269 --> 01:16:36.032
Is there a back way out?

01:16:36.204 --> 01:16:40.038
- What happened to Susan?
- Listen, you're in danger, all right?

01:16:40.208 --> 01:16:42.802
- What's going on?
- It doesn't--

01:16:43.411 --> 01:16:46.107
- Can I go to my place?
- No, they'II kill you.

01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:50.809
Oh, my God!

01:16:51.219 --> 01:16:54.245
You have to get lost,
and I mean really lost.

01:16:54.422 --> 01:16:56.913
Thank you for before.

01:16:57.125 --> 01:16:58.888
- Go.
- There he is!

01:17:08.970 --> 01:17:10.801
Look out, he's got a gun!

01:17:10.972 --> 01:17:14.635
I think we should go back
to the Pentagon, sir.

01:17:21.749 --> 01:17:27.051
That was a stupid,
stupid thing you did.

01:17:27.222 --> 01:17:30.714
- You're crazy.
- I'm gonna save Brice, no matter what.

01:17:30.892 --> 01:17:33.759
- I told you.
- I don't believe there is a Yuri.

01:17:33.928 --> 01:17:36.488
- He's real.
- He has nothing to do with that girl.

01:17:36.698 --> 01:17:41.533
- We'II find out when we catch him.
- Not if those two get to him first.

01:17:41.703 --> 01:17:44.467
Damn it!
I am tired of weakness.

01:17:44.639 --> 01:17:49.338
I am faced with a grave problem,
and I intend to resolve it quickly.

01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:51.637
You are crazy.
You're fucking cuckoo.

01:17:51.813 --> 01:17:56.341
You're not to attempt to interfere
with this investigation again.

01:17:56.517 --> 01:18:00.044
- Do I make myself clear?
- I quit.

01:18:00.221 --> 01:18:03.054
Your resignation is not accepted.
Be reasonable.

01:18:03.224 --> 01:18:07.661
I'm shielding you. Follow orders
and everything will be all right.

01:18:07.829 --> 01:18:09.854
Let him go!

01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:18.703
Will you excuse me, please?

01:18:18.907 --> 01:18:24.345
I hope you're not calling your
girlfriend. Big Brother's listening.

01:18:24.779 --> 01:18:26.679
- I don't give a shit.
- Hello?

01:18:26.848 --> 01:18:28.941
- Fox!
- Hello, sir.

01:18:29.117 --> 01:18:33.349
The writing on the box is Arabic,
but it's in the Maghrebi dialect.

01:18:33.521 --> 01:18:35.318
What they speak in Morocco.

01:18:35.490 --> 01:18:38.789
What it says is kind of flowery,
but it boils down to.

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:41.258
"A gift to a true friend. "

01:18:41.429 --> 01:18:44.694
Good boy, you can come back now.

01:18:50.171 --> 01:18:51.502
Oh, jeez.

01:18:58.446 --> 01:19:02.746
The Polaroid just came online.
Not much to look at, is it?

01:19:02.917 --> 01:19:05.283
No, it's not.

01:19:08.056 --> 01:19:12.049
Don't gifts from foreign governments
have to be registered?

01:19:12.226 --> 01:19:14.626
- Yeah.
- Are their files computerized?

01:19:14.796 --> 01:19:17.822
They'd be in the
Department of State's computer.

01:19:17.999 --> 01:19:20.593
Can we access those files?

01:19:21.302 --> 01:19:25.261
They're closed. You'II have to get
in touch with them tomorrow.

01:19:26.741 --> 01:19:29.574
I can't get in touch with them.

01:19:40.455 --> 01:19:43.515
- We can interface.
- Can you do it now?

01:19:45.994 --> 01:19:48.394
There'II be hell to pay.

01:19:49.263 --> 01:19:52.755
Tom, does it matter to you that much?

01:19:59.073 --> 01:20:01.007
Okay.

01:20:01.876 --> 01:20:05.539
Thanks, I'II be back in five minutes.

01:20:09.083 --> 01:20:10.948
Come in.

01:20:15.223 --> 01:20:16.485
What is it now?

01:20:20.361 --> 01:20:22.886
I've been thinking.
Maybe you're right.

01:20:23.064 --> 01:20:24.497
Yes.

01:20:24.799 --> 01:20:31.102
Let's just get this business over with,
and I'm sorry I blew up at you.

01:20:31.939 --> 01:20:33.907
We're all very tired.

01:20:37.045 --> 01:20:38.706
Tom...

01:20:39.714 --> 01:20:43.810
...when this is out of the way,
we can do great things here.

01:20:46.254 --> 01:20:50.122
Well, first things first.

01:20:59.467 --> 01:21:00.764
How we doing, Sam?

01:21:00.935 --> 01:21:03.563
I'm into the State Department computer.

01:21:03.738 --> 01:21:07.037
- Can you print that out for me?
- You got it.

01:21:07.208 --> 01:21:11.110
A lot of paper. You were right
about the credit card receipts.

01:21:11.279 --> 01:21:14.806
We found one from
a gas station in Annapolis.

01:21:15.183 --> 01:21:17.014
Great.

01:21:19.287 --> 01:21:23.690
- These the new people at the Pentagon?
- Yeah, 4700 possibles so far.

01:21:23.858 --> 01:21:29.125
We've had a real break. The CID
has pinned down your man's blood type.

01:21:29.297 --> 01:21:32.494
- How'd they get that?
- Autopsy specimen.

01:21:32.667 --> 01:21:36.569
There was semen in the woman's body.
Blood type is A-positive.

01:21:36.737 --> 01:21:40.070
That's pretty common,
but it'II help narrow the list.

01:21:42.143 --> 01:21:44.543
You're a genius, Sam.

01:21:45.546 --> 01:21:48.413
I am. I am. I am.

01:22:04.866 --> 01:22:09.098
You should get some sleep.
You must be exhausted.

01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:12.068
I know if I'm exhausted or not.

01:22:12.406 --> 01:22:14.499
As you say.

01:22:14.876 --> 01:22:18.334
You look like you just
stepped out of a bandbox.

01:22:19.113 --> 01:22:22.742
- You're actually enjoying this.
- I'm trying to do my job.

01:22:22.917 --> 01:22:26.853
It would be a lot easier
if you'd stop attacking me.

01:22:29.624 --> 01:22:31.592
I'm sorry, I'm just tired.

01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:34.089
I've got a lot on my mind.

01:22:38.132 --> 01:22:44.264
If it doesn't move towards a coherent
image, we just adjust the program.

01:22:44.438 --> 01:22:48.465
You mean, you could stop it and
make it go in another direction?

01:22:48.643 --> 01:22:53.740
We've been doing that all along,
but it looks like it's doing fine now.

01:22:58.052 --> 01:23:00.418
I'm not so sure.

01:23:24.879 --> 01:23:27.746
I think it's time we had a talk.

01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:42.127
I'm the one in the picture, Sam.

01:23:44.332 --> 01:23:45.890
You?

01:23:48.903 --> 01:23:52.634
Susan Atwell was the woman
I've been seeing.

01:23:53.341 --> 01:23:56.572
I had nothing to do
with her death.

01:23:56.811 --> 01:23:58.438
I was in love with her.

01:24:01.148 --> 01:24:03.116
Jesus, you must feel terrible.

01:24:06.187 --> 01:24:10.624
You're the only one I can tell that
this spy-hunt thing's a phony.

01:24:10.791 --> 01:24:14.420
Yuri doesn't have anything
to do with the murder?

01:24:14.595 --> 01:24:18.929
This, it's a cover-up.
That's all I can tell you.

01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:22.866
- Come on.
- Goddamn it, Sam, this is--

01:24:23.838 --> 01:24:26.966
This is for your own
protection, all right?

01:24:27.141 --> 01:24:31.510
These people have already tried
to kill one person who knew.

01:24:32.246 --> 01:24:35.773
- What do you want me to do?
- Slow the resolution on that.

01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:40.410
I need more time. I need more time
to get this straightened out.

01:24:51.132 --> 01:24:53.362
That's what I need.

01:25:10.384 --> 01:25:14.377
I'm not satisfied with this.
The Eigenvalue is off.

01:25:14.555 --> 01:25:16.022
Looks all right to me.

01:25:16.190 --> 01:25:18.590
We're pulling away
from our information.

01:25:18.759 --> 01:25:22.024
Advise them to program
a Fourier Transform.

01:25:22.196 --> 01:25:26.257
- That seems like a waste of time.
- Just do what I want, okay?

01:25:26.434 --> 01:25:29.369
Easy, we're all working
the same amount of time.

01:25:29.537 --> 01:25:33.564
I'm sorry, David.
Just do it, please, okay?

01:25:49.824 --> 01:25:51.849
What are you looking for?

01:25:52.026 --> 01:25:54.153
Fuck off.

01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:10.870
Where are you going?

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:24.617
I would rather do this myself.
You can listen if you want to.

01:26:35.636 --> 01:26:37.604
- Display that badge. Hi.
- Hi.

01:26:38.773 --> 01:26:41.264
- This goes here?
- Yeah.

01:26:41.442 --> 01:26:44.036
- Where are we going?
- Major Donovan's office.

01:26:44.211 --> 01:26:47.408
- Give a description of this guy to him.
- Who's Donovan?

01:26:47.581 --> 01:26:49.481
Our commanding officer.

01:27:42.102 --> 01:27:43.660
Hello.

01:27:43.838 --> 01:27:46.306
You know who this is?

01:27:47.908 --> 01:27:51.867
I have to talk to you,
but I can't leave here now.

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:56.810
I'm on the damn pay phone now.
It's probably not even safe.

01:28:01.255 --> 01:28:04.588
All right, I'II come there
as soon as I can get away.

01:28:18.739 --> 01:28:22.402
I'II be damned! That's the son
of a bitch who rented the boat!

01:28:22.576 --> 01:28:24.476
- Where?
- He just went around the corner!

01:28:31.652 --> 01:28:35.611
- Do you see him?
- He's gone.

01:28:37.324 --> 01:28:40.157
I'II get back to you.
Yuri's in the building.

01:28:40.327 --> 01:28:43.057
- Buzz the secretary.
- A witness spotted him.

01:28:43.230 --> 01:28:45.289
I know! Can I go in?

01:28:45.466 --> 01:28:48.924
- Go right in.
- What are my orders, sir?

01:28:49.103 --> 01:28:52.766
Close all exits. Hold your witness
while we decide what to do.

01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:55.001
Yes, sir.

01:28:57.945 --> 01:28:59.776
- Is Yuri in the building?
- So it seems.

01:28:59.947 --> 01:29:03.883
- This is splendid work, Tom.
- I've had all the exits closed.

01:29:05.219 --> 01:29:09.986
Why don't we empty the building and
have everybody file past this man?

01:29:10.190 --> 01:29:12.886
The place will be swarming
with cameramen.

01:29:13.093 --> 01:29:17.427
- We'II take the witness room by room.
- It's the world's largest building.

01:29:17.598 --> 01:29:20.362
It's the only way
we'II get any privacy.

01:29:20.534 --> 01:29:22.058
I'II see to it.

01:29:23.370 --> 01:29:27.500
Major Donovan, I suggest
that all officers carry side arms.

01:29:28.576 --> 01:29:31.443
The man we're after killed
one person already.

01:29:31.612 --> 01:29:34.945
Don't worry, Tom.
I don't expect you to carry one.

01:29:53.834 --> 01:29:56.928
Tall or short? Thin or fat?
Light or dark?

01:29:57.104 --> 01:30:00.540
- That's right.
- You think this is some kind of joke?

01:30:00.708 --> 01:30:04.576
What I'm trying to tell you
is the son of a bitch is average.

01:30:04.745 --> 01:30:09.273
All right, let's go find
this "average" son of a bitch.

01:30:09.883 --> 01:30:15.014
I'm positive I remember this guy.
I always remember the good tippers.

01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:28.134
CID has brought in another witness.
A bellboy from a hotel in Annapolis.

01:30:28.302 --> 01:30:30.862
Now you can have two search parties.

01:30:31.939 --> 01:30:35.773
That's great news.
We can move twice as fast.

01:30:36.343 --> 01:30:38.277
I'II see to it.

01:30:46.754 --> 01:30:49.621
You see, David?
It's all coming together.

01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:52.350
Dear God, I hope you're right.

01:31:16.116 --> 01:31:19.483
All right, down this corridor.
Make it quick.

01:31:19.653 --> 01:31:21.280
Let's go.

01:31:51.985 --> 01:31:55.978
That ain't him. I rented the guy
a sailboat, give me a break.

01:31:56.156 --> 01:31:57.589
I'm sick of this shit.

01:32:11.004 --> 01:32:12.130
How much longer?

01:32:12.306 --> 01:32:15.798
To search this entire building
would take all night.

01:32:15.976 --> 01:32:19.468
We have shifts finishing at 5 and 6.
What do we do then?

01:32:19.646 --> 01:32:21.807
Let them out through the mall.

01:32:21.982 --> 01:32:25.315
- We'II have both witnesses there.
- What do you think?

01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:27.915
Television.

01:32:28.122 --> 01:32:31.990
We haven't been allowed inside,
but we're told there's hundreds...

01:32:32.159 --> 01:32:34.889
...perhaps thousands,
waiting to go home.

01:32:35.062 --> 01:32:39.556
Those allowed to leave say they
were first cleared by the CID.

01:32:39.733 --> 01:32:43.328
The Criminal Investigative Division
of Army intelligence.

01:32:43.504 --> 01:32:47.372
Apparently, there's a search
for a person who may be a spy...

01:32:47.541 --> 01:32:50.806
...trapped, right now,
inside the Pentagon itself.

01:32:50.978 --> 01:32:53.344
We will follow events
as they develop...

01:32:53.814 --> 01:32:56.305
...and get back to you with updates.

01:32:56.483 --> 01:33:00.749
Melissa Donaldson, WCDM,
at the Pentagon.

01:33:00.988 --> 01:33:06.119
- He must have gotten out past us.
- No way. He's hiding in the building.

01:33:06.293 --> 01:33:08.557
We'II go back to the room-to-room.

01:33:08.729 --> 01:33:12.756
We'II search the situation room,
computer complex.

01:33:12.933 --> 01:33:16.664
We'II start at the bottom
and work our way up. Let's do it.

01:33:16.837 --> 01:33:18.600
Jesus.

01:33:21.175 --> 01:33:23.200
- You're to initial this.
- What?

01:33:23.377 --> 01:33:24.969
- Initial this.
- What is it?

01:33:25.145 --> 01:33:29.479
It's authorization to release
the Atwell woman's body for burial.

01:33:35.956 --> 01:33:38.424
Down to 50 persons
with A-positive blood.

01:33:38.592 --> 01:33:39.820
How many are men?

01:33:39.993 --> 01:33:44.487
Nobody told me to sort them by sex.
Look, I gotta take a break, man.

01:33:44.665 --> 01:33:47.498
Sam, I need to talk to you.

01:33:57.377 --> 01:33:59.937
- I have to have your help.
- I slowed it up.

01:34:00.113 --> 01:34:03.082
- They're gonna recognize this picture.
- There's nothing I can do.

01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:06.083
- They mean to kill me.
- You haven't slept for days.

01:34:06.253 --> 01:34:10.485
- I don't stand a chance in hell.
- For God sakes, why?

01:34:10.657 --> 01:34:14.491
- Why would anybody want--?
- Brice killed her.

01:34:14.661 --> 01:34:16.219
- Brice?
- She was his mistress.

01:34:16.396 --> 01:34:21.459
- I thought she was your girl.
- Look, here. See this?

01:34:21.602 --> 01:34:23.729
- See this?
- "Antique gold box"--

01:34:23.904 --> 01:34:27.499
This is a present to Brice from Morocco.
He gave it to Susan.

01:34:27.674 --> 01:34:29.403
It's the only way
I can prove he knew her.

01:34:29.576 --> 01:34:33.603
He'II call off the search,
Sam, I know he will.

01:34:33.814 --> 01:34:36.977
- I see.
- Do you believe me?

01:34:37.150 --> 01:34:42.087
Well, then can you insert that into
the State Department's computer?

01:34:42.623 --> 01:34:47.424
- I can do that.
- I know you can, Sam, but will you?

01:34:47.594 --> 01:34:51.496
- I'II do whatever I have to do to help.
- Then let's do it.

01:35:28.936 --> 01:35:30.335
There's nothing there.

01:35:30.504 --> 01:35:33.439
If you want a piece of paper,
type it yourself.

01:35:33.607 --> 01:35:38.237
The computer is searching to find
a place to insert it. Then it'II print.

01:35:38.412 --> 01:35:41.040
- All right, how long?
- Soon.

01:35:41.214 --> 01:35:44.149
First two on the right,
second two on the left.

01:35:44.318 --> 01:35:47.253
Last man in the doorway.
Nobody in or out.

01:35:47.888 --> 01:35:50.186
- What's going on?
- We're gonna search.

01:35:50.357 --> 01:35:52.689
- Who told you to bring them here?
- Nobody.

01:35:52.859 --> 01:35:56.454
This is the only major area
that hasn't been covered yet.

01:35:59.333 --> 01:36:04.032
We'II be conducting a search in here,
and I ask you all, please--

01:36:04.371 --> 01:36:07.704
- Sir, wait.
- Oh, Jesus.

01:36:08.141 --> 01:36:09.665
I have to change.

01:36:12.646 --> 01:36:16.946
- Okay, let's get going.
- Don't let anyone pass.

01:36:39.873 --> 01:36:42.034
Sam Hesselman.

01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:48.847
Look, I'm sorry to bother you,
but this is over my head.

01:36:49.016 --> 01:36:51.507
It's about Commander Farrell.

01:36:52.886 --> 01:36:54.945
I'm not sure--

01:36:57.057 --> 01:36:59.855
I'm not sure he knows
what he's doing.

01:37:01.895 --> 01:37:05.126
I'II meet you. Don't mention
this to anybody else.

01:37:05.298 --> 01:37:09.667
I mean, the reason I called you
was because I know you're his friend.

01:37:09.836 --> 01:37:12.327
You did the right thing.

01:37:16.977 --> 01:37:21.209
- This door's locked.
- Anybody have an extra key out here?

01:37:23.650 --> 01:37:26.949
- This is Commander Farrell's office.
- We better look.

01:37:39.666 --> 01:37:43.727
Well, tell you what, fellas.
Here we go, maybe this will work.

01:38:08.261 --> 01:38:09.888
Nobody here.

01:38:10.063 --> 01:38:14.762
Let's get on up the hall here and see
what else we can come up with.

01:38:31.551 --> 01:38:33.075
Hi.

01:38:34.554 --> 01:38:38.046
What's this all about, Dr. Hesselman?

01:38:39.526 --> 01:38:42.586
Promise me what I tell you
won't go any further.

01:38:42.762 --> 01:38:46.254
- I feel disloyal enough as it is.
- Of course.

01:38:48.168 --> 01:38:51.228
You understand that Tom
is under great strain.

01:38:51.404 --> 01:38:52.996
Yes.

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:56.104
He knew the girl who was murdered.

01:38:57.010 --> 01:39:01.174
They were very close.

01:39:01.681 --> 01:39:05.412
And he thinks that
Secretary Brice killed her.

01:39:06.486 --> 01:39:10.752
Look, I know him. He's much
more high-strung than he appears.

01:39:10.924 --> 01:39:13.620
And this girl...

01:39:14.828 --> 01:39:17.661
...I guess he was in love with her.

01:39:18.465 --> 01:39:21.161
He thinks that somebody
wants to kill him...

01:39:21.334 --> 01:39:25.293
...and he asked me to reprogram
the computers, and I did it.

01:39:25.539 --> 01:39:31.034
But now I don't know.
I just don't know.

01:39:31.478 --> 01:39:34.311
I see.
Where is Commander Farrell now?

01:39:35.248 --> 01:39:38.706
I suppose he's in his office
or in the computer room.

01:39:38.885 --> 01:39:40.978
Thank you.

01:40:53.627 --> 01:40:55.959
Son of a bitch.

01:42:00.393 --> 01:42:01.758
Hey!

01:42:02.329 --> 01:42:04.627
- Come back here!
- Hold it right there!

01:42:04.798 --> 01:42:06.891
- Hold it!
- Sergeant, arrest that man.

01:42:07.067 --> 01:42:10.628
I'm giving you a direct order
to arrest this man!

01:42:10.804 --> 01:42:13.466
- I have my orders from Mr. Pritchard!
- Do it!

01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:15.631
- I have my orders--
- Shut up!

01:42:15.809 --> 01:42:17.436
Jesus.

01:42:17.877 --> 01:42:19.902
- If he resists, shoot him!
- Yes.

01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:24.073
- Where are you going, commander?
- You can't go in there.

01:42:24.250 --> 01:42:26.718
- You can't go in there.
- By what right do--?

01:42:26.886 --> 01:42:28.854
- Call off the search.
- Thank you.

01:42:29.022 --> 01:42:33.118
You're looking for somebody who
knows Atwell was your mistress.

01:42:33.293 --> 01:42:36.729
- What are you talking about?
- You gave her a gold box.

01:42:36.896 --> 01:42:39.490
- What?
- You declared it to protocol!

01:42:39.666 --> 01:42:41.463
- I never declared anything.
- Yeah?

01:42:41.634 --> 01:42:44.797
- You tell it to the State's computer.
- What?

01:42:44.971 --> 01:42:50.068
Tell it to the computer at the State
Department. Call off the search now!

01:42:50.243 --> 01:42:54.805
- Do it, or I'II nail you to the wall.
- Calm down, I'II get Scott in here--

01:42:54.981 --> 01:42:57.609
Come in, for God's sake.

01:42:58.852 --> 01:43:01.343
I had to make sure
you were all right.

01:43:01.821 --> 01:43:05.382
Yuri must be close.
There's been a murder.

01:43:05.558 --> 01:43:08.959
- He shot Dr. Hesselman.
- Oh, goddamn it.

01:43:09.129 --> 01:43:11.097
What's happened, major?

01:43:11.264 --> 01:43:15.997
Yuri's somewhere between communications
and the officers' gymnasium.

01:43:16.169 --> 01:43:19.434
That's very good, major.
Just continue the search.

01:43:28.948 --> 01:43:31.781
You had those apes
kill him, didn't you?

01:43:31.951 --> 01:43:33.418
No.

01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:37.214
You lying sack of shit.

01:43:38.158 --> 01:43:41.719
Tom is the man
who saw you at Susan's.

01:43:41.895 --> 01:43:45.729
He's known about you
all along. Isn't that right?

01:43:45.932 --> 01:43:48.526
You know what that means, David.

01:43:48.701 --> 01:43:51.761
If Commander Farrell
was the man with Miss Atwell...

01:43:51.938 --> 01:43:54.998
...then Farrell is the man
who killed Miss Atwell.

01:43:55.175 --> 01:43:58.702
And we know that the man
who killed Miss Atwell is Yuri.

01:43:58.945 --> 01:44:04.247
Therefore, Commander Farrell is Yuri,
quod erat demonstrandum.

01:44:04.417 --> 01:44:09.184
You murdered Sam, didn't you?
You're a fucking asshole.

01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:18.420
You have no idea
what men of power can do!

01:44:18.598 --> 01:44:20.862
- You sick fuck.
- Wait a second.

01:44:21.034 --> 01:44:24.060
Scott has been a loyal
and valuable friend.

01:44:24.237 --> 01:44:26.728
I let that friendship
cloud my judgment.

01:44:26.906 --> 01:44:29.670
My actions have been inexcusable.

01:44:29.843 --> 01:44:33.745
Scott! Scott!

01:44:34.347 --> 01:44:36.076
Give me the gun.

01:44:37.083 --> 01:44:39.984
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

01:44:40.153 --> 01:44:43.782
But I swear, I'II do everything
I can to help you out.

01:44:43.957 --> 01:44:47.051
I'II get you the best lawyers.

01:44:48.862 --> 01:44:53.424
David? He doesn't have
a shred of proof.

01:44:54.067 --> 01:44:56.865
Wait. Wait. Wait.

01:44:57.036 --> 01:45:01.234
He was jealous of Susan.
A man like that-- Do you understand?

01:45:01.407 --> 01:45:04.706
Suppose we had planned
on working late Sunday night.

01:45:04.878 --> 01:45:06.869
He assumed I was with Susan.

01:45:07.046 --> 01:45:09.310
- David.
- Don't touch me.

01:45:09.482 --> 01:45:13.714
He went there looking for me.
They argued. You can assume the rest.

01:45:13.887 --> 01:45:16.048
- Just save your breath.
- Help me out.

01:45:16.222 --> 01:45:17.985
Help me out. Help me out.

01:45:19.392 --> 01:45:22.725
Listen, I'II give you
anything you want.

01:45:22.896 --> 01:45:26.525
I swear. I'II give you anything
you want. Listen to me.

01:45:26.699 --> 01:45:30.965
Help me out. I will give you
anything you want, just help me out.

01:45:31.137 --> 01:45:36.234
If you go against me on this, it'II be
your word against mine, and I'II win.

01:45:36.509 --> 01:45:38.067
David!

01:45:39.045 --> 01:45:40.478
- Scott!
- No!

01:45:49.789 --> 01:45:53.452
- What's going on in there?
- Stand back, Mr. Secretary.

01:45:59.732 --> 01:46:01.097
Nelson.

01:46:06.406 --> 01:46:08.931
Your search is over, major.

01:46:12.745 --> 01:46:15.976
- Is this--?
- He shot himself.

01:46:20.286 --> 01:46:21.776
Anderson.

01:46:30.363 --> 01:46:33.298
Commander, do I have your answer?

01:46:33.967 --> 01:46:37.596
Commander? Sir?
Sir, are you all right, sir?

01:46:37.770 --> 01:46:39.635
- Give me your pen, ensign.
- Sir?

01:46:39.806 --> 01:46:41.034
- You got a pen?
- Yes.

01:46:41.207 --> 01:46:43.198
Well, give it to me.

01:46:45.812 --> 01:46:47.746
I want you to deliver this.

01:46:48.781 --> 01:46:51.011
I want you to wake him if you have to.

01:46:53.219 --> 01:46:55.210
Aye, aye, sir.

01:46:55.655 --> 01:46:57.179
Go.

01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:13.470
Charlie, come look at this.

01:47:14.140 --> 01:47:18.634
- Somebody get Donovan down here.
- It's Commander Farrell.

01:48:00.053 --> 01:48:03.284
A lot of people are looking for you.

01:48:05.692 --> 01:48:08.923
Then aren't you the clever ones.

01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:25.043
- When is he coming out from there?
- When you've made things clear to us.

01:48:25.211 --> 01:48:28.772
- Well, then, let's just get--
- We want to know what is--

01:48:28.948 --> 01:48:31.610
You would've known before!

01:48:31.784 --> 01:48:34.719
I told you I could not
get out of the Pentagon!

01:48:34.887 --> 01:48:38.084
Your relationship with
the woman was poorly handled.

01:48:38.257 --> 01:48:40.623
You wanted me to be her lover,
I was her lover.

01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:44.796
- I don't see any point with this!
- Yeah, well, neither do I!

01:48:48.101 --> 01:48:50.763
We thought we'd never
see you again.

01:48:51.304 --> 01:48:53.295
So did I.

01:48:53.806 --> 01:48:56.070
Couldn't you have
managed this better?

01:48:56.442 --> 01:48:57.739
Not so fast...

01:48:58.311 --> 01:49:00.279
It's difficult for me
to follow in Russian.

01:49:00.446 --> 01:49:01.470
It's been very long for me.

01:49:01.647 --> 01:49:04.980
How thirsty you must be for
the sound of our language.

01:49:05.151 --> 01:49:09.212
Evgeni Alekseevich, wouldn't you
love to hear Russian again?

01:49:09.689 --> 01:49:13.056
Imagine Pushkin,
Lermontov, Tolstoy.

01:49:13.226 --> 01:49:15.888
Solzhenitsyn, Aksenov.

01:49:16.062 --> 01:49:19.759
Even then, always the sense of humor.

01:49:19.966 --> 01:49:24.767
In the Philippines when you passed the
underwear bag, Moscow wasn't amused.

01:49:24.904 --> 01:49:27.236
I should have acted then.

01:49:27.406 --> 01:49:30.773
It's not possible for you
to remain in the United States.

01:49:30.943 --> 01:49:34.242
This bizarre incident
has given them their Yuri.

01:49:34.413 --> 01:49:36.608
Evgeni, think.

01:49:36.783 --> 01:49:40.082
- You're a hero of the Soviet Union.
- I'm not a hero.

01:49:40.253 --> 01:49:45.714
- Be that as it may, you must return.
- I came here. I thought I owed you that.

01:49:45.892 --> 01:49:48.520
But you can't make me go back.

01:49:53.533 --> 01:49:55.057
No!

01:49:55.835 --> 01:49:57.735
Let him go.

01:50:04.977 --> 01:50:09.539
He will return. Where else
does he have to go?
