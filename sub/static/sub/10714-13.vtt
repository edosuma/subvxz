WEBVTT

00:02.796 --> 00:04.415
Do you think it's our fault?

00:05.109 --> 00:06.741
Of course it's our fault.

00:09.118 --> 00:11.417
We made them our
friends. We coddled them.

00:11.442 --> 00:12.987
I don't think we coddle them.

00:13.012 --> 00:15.588
Look at us right now. We're whispering
so as not to wake up our daughter,

00:15.613 --> 00:17.411
who's passed out on a counter

00:19.394 --> 00:21.150
reeking of gin.

00:21.229 --> 00:22.629
I think it might be rum.

00:22.654 --> 00:23.985
Yeah, let's argue about that.

00:27.603 --> 00:30.000
Can you believe I once told
her she could be president?

00:31.039 --> 00:34.117
All the crap we told them
to give them self-esteem.

00:34.142 --> 00:36.203
My father never gave me self-esteem.

00:36.228 --> 00:38.086
He never even said that he loved me.

00:38.111 --> 00:40.558
And look at me; I hate
myself, and I'm doing great.

00:42.928 --> 00:44.287
Least he stuck around. I mean,

00:44.312 --> 00:47.286
my hippie mom left when I was
seven to go live on an ashram.

00:47.655 --> 00:49.253
I still don't know what that is.

00:50.658 --> 00:52.208
Mike, you in there?

00:52.233 --> 00:53.692
No, I'm not.

00:54.409 --> 00:56.622
See, I don't want him to come in here.

00:56.647 --> 00:58.914
That's how our kids
should feel about us.

01:00.088 --> 01:04.196
Oh, jeez, look at
this. Passed out drunk.

01:04.221 --> 01:05.972
It's all because of your permissive...

01:05.997 --> 01:07.976
Wait, stop me if she's actually dead.

01:09.076 --> 01:10.977
She's fine, and you
don't have to yell at us.

01:11.002 --> 01:12.711
We were just yelling at ourselves.

01:12.988 --> 01:15.057
We're just here to say good-bye.

01:15.082 --> 01:17.652
Bob and I are heading out
for a weekend at the cabin.

01:18.605 --> 01:19.811
Oh.

01:21.562 --> 01:23.475
Shoot, my sister Rhonda.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.282
Shoot your sister Rhonda? I'll do it.

01:26.359 --> 01:29.131
Stop that. I've got to take this.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.796
You know, I've been thinking
about doing some hunting up there.

01:31.821 --> 01:33.754
How are you fixed for venison jerky?

01:33.934 --> 01:37.122
Picture all the venison jerky
that you've ever given me.

01:37.568 --> 01:38.797
I still have it.

01:39.873 --> 01:42.113
Oh, Bob, I can't go.

01:42.137 --> 01:43.848
Rhonda's boyfriend cheated on her,

01:43.873 --> 01:45.965
and now I've got to drive
to Tacoma to keep her

01:45.990 --> 01:48.079
from burning his house down again.

01:48.114 --> 01:50.637
I guess you'll just have to
go to the cabin without me.

01:50.662 --> 01:52.716
But it won't be as romantic without you.

01:53.329 --> 01:56.176
So it'll still be a little romantic?

01:57.486 --> 01:59.110
I mean, I'll still build a fire

01:59.135 --> 02:02.121
and pour myself a glass of
wine, and nuke a Hot Pocket.

02:03.195 --> 02:05.086
I know how to show myself a good time.

02:05.898 --> 02:08.372
You know, Dad, you shouldn't
go to the cabin by yourself.

02:08.396 --> 02:10.449
Um... I'm just remembering
the caretaker called,

02:10.475 --> 02:12.075
said the place was
crawling with spiders.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.871
Oh, don't tell me that.

02:13.906 --> 02:16.173
I hate those creepy-crawly
little bastards.

02:16.740 --> 02:19.943
Ooh, four legs I'll give you,
six, all right, you're a bug.

02:19.978 --> 02:22.143
Eight legs, ooh,
that's a devil creature.

02:22.959 --> 02:24.525
Fine, no cabin.

02:27.888 --> 02:30.543
The caretaker didn't call. Why
did you talk your dad out of going?

02:30.568 --> 02:34.011
Because we're going to the cabin. Just
the two of us, you and me, right now.

02:34.036 --> 02:36.307
Oh, that sounds great. Let me just

02:36.332 --> 02:38.721
- leave a note for the girls.
- No, no, no, no note.

02:38.746 --> 02:41.737
You and I have to get away, and they
need to learn to fend for themselves.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.528
Ah, absolutely. I agree.

02:43.553 --> 02:45.806
No more coddling, old-school parenting.

02:45.831 --> 02:49.311
Today is the first day
of the rest of our lives.

02:49.336 --> 02:53.027
Well, technically every day is the
first day of the rest of our lives.

02:53.052 --> 02:55.582
Eh, you're not gonna be like
that all weekend, are you?

02:55.607 --> 02:58.190
- Yes, but I'll also be naked.
- Deal.

03:13.029 --> 03:14.320
Morning, Stell.

03:16.262 --> 03:18.262
Huh? What?

03:18.464 --> 03:19.964
Bitch, I will cut you.

03:22.908 --> 03:24.431
Oh, it's you.

03:24.864 --> 03:26.364
Good morning.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.341
- What's that envelope?
- No idea.

03:31.205 --> 03:33.086
"Dear girls, don't tell
your father I told you,

03:33.111 --> 03:34.616
"but we've gone away for the weekend.

03:34.641 --> 03:36.607
Open this only if
there is an emergency."

03:36.896 --> 03:38.242
So insulting,

03:38.267 --> 03:40.611
like we can't handle
a weekend without them.

03:40.781 --> 03:42.246
Can you make some coffee?

03:42.271 --> 03:44.911
I don't know how to make coffee.
You don't know how to make coffee?

03:45.083 --> 03:46.973
Mom always does it. Open the envelope.

03:49.154 --> 03:50.838
Wait. We could just go to Starbucks.

03:50.944 --> 03:54.425
Right. You've always been
good in a crisis, Shea.

03:55.628 --> 03:58.467
Also, with Mom and Dad
gone, we can work on,

03:58.492 --> 04:00.836
you know, Operation: Project.

04:00.861 --> 04:03.400
They're not here. You can say
what Operation: Project is.

04:03.425 --> 04:04.634
All right, we can work on our...

04:07.173 --> 04:09.415
- Oh, God, did you hear that?
- Of course I did.

04:09.440 --> 04:10.953
I'm opening the envelope.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.410
Wait, it sounds like it's
coming from the basement.

04:13.445 --> 04:14.745
Shouldn't we just go check it out?

04:14.780 --> 04:16.747
What do we always yell at
the people in horror movies

04:16.781 --> 04:18.027
right before they get murdered?

04:18.052 --> 04:19.526
"Don't go see what the scary noise is.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.495
The killer's in there.
Get out of the house."

04:22.387 --> 04:24.421
Sure, you're the nerdy
virgin who lives in the end,

04:24.456 --> 04:26.958
but I'm the sexy, popular girl
who gets an ax in the forehead.

04:28.754 --> 04:30.727
- I'm not a virgin.
- Close enough.

04:30.752 --> 04:32.148
Two is not zero.

04:34.113 --> 04:36.629
Oh, we've got to get out of
here. We'll open it in the car.

04:40.339 --> 04:45.057
Oh, wow, this is gonna be so romantic.

04:45.082 --> 04:46.282
Mm-mmm.

04:46.432 --> 04:48.334
- You want romance?
- Uh-huh.

04:48.847 --> 04:50.101
Check this out.

04:50.842 --> 04:53.090
Whoo, look at you.

04:53.246 --> 04:55.167
I know, I'm coming off
great right now, aren't I?

04:56.426 --> 04:58.016
You know, I think I can make
it all the way to the couch.

04:58.041 --> 04:59.474
- You do it, buddy.
- Okay.

05:00.726 --> 05:02.074
And here we are.

05:02.921 --> 05:05.263
Oh, this is such a great idea.

05:05.288 --> 05:07.929
Getting away from the girls
is exactly what we needed.

05:07.954 --> 05:09.675
You know what this weekend's gonna be?

05:09.700 --> 05:11.922
What our life was
supposed to be if the girls

05:11.924 --> 05:13.329
had never moved back.

05:13.852 --> 05:15.098
Picture it.

05:16.140 --> 05:18.145
Are you as turned on as I am right now?

05:18.811 --> 05:20.906
Even more so. I think I'm done.

05:24.775 --> 05:26.509
- But I'll rally.
- Mm-hmm.

05:27.705 --> 05:29.847
This weekend, let's try new things,

05:30.080 --> 05:32.761
sexy things, birthday things.

05:34.023 --> 05:35.684
Your birthday or mine?

05:36.879 --> 05:38.079
Mine, please.

05:41.653 --> 05:43.956
All right. Um...

05:43.981 --> 05:48.503
how about you're a lonely
woodsman, and I'm...

05:48.528 --> 05:50.732
- Mom.
- Oh, no, I don't like that.

05:52.675 --> 05:54.159
No, no, no, no. My mom's here.

05:54.504 --> 05:55.803
Oh, my God.

05:56.012 --> 05:58.754
Mike, is that really you?

05:58.779 --> 06:00.333
I don't believe this.
What are you doing here?

06:00.358 --> 06:01.558
Hold on.

06:01.739 --> 06:05.536
I haven't seen you for 40 years. I
just want to look at you for a second.

06:06.740 --> 06:08.134
Oh, wow.

06:08.271 --> 06:10.937
Your aura is so murky right now.

06:12.326 --> 06:14.896
If you'd like, I could
do some reiki on you.

06:16.699 --> 06:17.954
Are you high?

06:18.600 --> 06:21.073
Well, just coming
down, but I've got more.

06:24.747 --> 06:26.371
Mom, what are you doing here?

06:26.396 --> 06:28.750
Well, I got your message,
and I was on my way to see you

06:28.775 --> 06:31.043
and my spirit guide came
to me in a dream and said,

06:31.068 --> 06:33.835
"No, hold off. You're
not strong enough yet."

06:33.870 --> 06:37.569
So I decided to come to our
old cabin to center myself.

06:38.054 --> 06:39.519
Nothing strange about that.

06:40.443 --> 06:42.610
But I didn't know you
and Martina were here.

06:42.910 --> 06:44.412
Oh, my goddess.

06:44.437 --> 06:46.758
Did I interrupt the act of lovemaking?

06:48.216 --> 06:50.668
Because that is so
important to a couple.

06:50.693 --> 06:53.771
Your father and I always
connected on that level.

06:59.661 --> 07:03.130
Your father had the most
beautiful penis I'd ever seen.

07:06.561 --> 07:08.180
Anyone else need a drink?

07:09.404 --> 07:14.365
Martina, I have some
mung bean wine in my bag.

07:14.390 --> 07:15.750
Yeah, that'll hit the spot.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.672
Everything okay in there?

07:24.697 --> 07:28.067
Ah, yeah, just a
couple of bad squirrels.

07:29.503 --> 07:30.890
What are you doing here?

07:30.915 --> 07:33.291
- We heard a noise.
- A scary noise.

07:33.316 --> 07:35.375
Girls, that's not an emergency!

07:35.400 --> 07:36.720
You didn't hear it. It was like...

07:39.176 --> 07:40.799
No, it was more like...

07:45.430 --> 07:46.630
Stop it!

07:48.219 --> 07:50.281
God, you're such pussies.

07:52.836 --> 07:56.069
Look, I will never hear the end
of it if your father sees you here.

07:56.350 --> 07:57.727
Go sneak into the guest room.

07:57.752 --> 08:01.614
Use the fire ladder, but be
careful. That ladder is rickety.

08:01.962 --> 08:03.970
Oh, I'll just come hold it for you.

08:05.595 --> 08:08.030
Mike, I thought it
would be good to see you,

08:08.055 --> 08:09.945
but it's even better than I imagined.

08:09.970 --> 08:12.940
Let's forget about the past
and start all over again.

08:12.965 --> 08:15.626
I don't know if I can do that. There's
still a lot of anger and resentment.

08:15.651 --> 08:17.749
I was seven years old,
and you just disappeared.

08:17.774 --> 08:19.804
Yes, express it.

08:19.839 --> 08:23.123
Yell, scream, think of me as
your emotional punching bag.

08:23.510 --> 08:26.847
But before you do, let me just tell
you one little thing: I'm dying.

08:26.872 --> 08:28.746
Now, go ahead. Let me have it.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.410
What?

08:31.435 --> 08:34.691
I don't know how much time I have
left, but forget that. Yell away.

08:36.500 --> 08:39.202
Well, I can't be mad at you now
that I know that you're dying.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.871
Oh, Mike.

08:40.897 --> 08:44.265
The look of love and forgiveness
on your face right now.

08:44.290 --> 08:46.955
It almost makes me
wish I really was dying.

08:47.519 --> 08:48.719
Wait....

08:48.744 --> 08:50.166
You're not dying?

08:50.191 --> 08:52.169
No. Isn't it a relief?

08:54.560 --> 08:58.855
Look, I just don't want to waste
time going over all the bad stuff.

08:58.880 --> 09:02.065
When you called, I felt like there was
a chance for us to start over again.

09:02.090 --> 09:06.983
I came to the cabin, because I had
such happy memories of this place.

09:07.499 --> 09:09.152
Well, we did have fun here.

09:09.187 --> 09:11.220
I made so many mistakes.

09:11.741 --> 09:14.858
I wish my spirit guide
could send me back in time

09:14.883 --> 09:16.920
to when you and I would hang out here

09:16.945 --> 09:19.061
waiting for your father
to come knock at the door.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.943
Open up, Mike. I know you're in there.

09:23.226 --> 09:24.916
Holy [bleep]. That worked.

09:26.866 --> 09:30.506
Ooh, I am so sorry. It took me
forever to find these glasses.

09:30.541 --> 09:32.638
Forget about the wine. Dad's here.

09:32.663 --> 09:34.910
- What?
- Let me in, you son of a bitch.

09:36.248 --> 09:38.317
Listen to him, sexy as ever.

09:38.342 --> 09:40.186
But I'm not ready to see him.

09:40.438 --> 09:42.251
I'll just hide in the guest room.

09:42.276 --> 09:44.071
Oh, no, not the guest room.

09:44.096 --> 09:46.863
Ah, you should use the master bedroom.

09:48.627 --> 09:50.453
So that's why you talked
me out of coming here,

09:50.478 --> 09:52.081
so you could come up here yourself.

09:52.106 --> 09:53.745
Real D-bag move, son.

09:55.866 --> 09:57.131
What are you doing here, Dad?

09:57.166 --> 09:59.333
The house was too lonely without Alice.

09:59.369 --> 10:01.258
Oh, that's sweet, Dad. Anyway, go home.

10:01.283 --> 10:02.539
Ah j...

10:02.642 --> 10:04.233
I'm not going anywhere.

10:05.372 --> 10:09.390
Jeez, after 40 years, this house still
smells like your mother's perfume.

10:09.782 --> 10:11.250
What a horrible woman.

10:12.977 --> 10:14.206
I'm exhausted.

10:14.422 --> 10:16.116
I'm gonna go crash in the master room.

10:16.141 --> 10:17.351
- No.
- Well, fine.

10:17.376 --> 10:19.053
- I'll take the guest room.
- No.

10:19.088 --> 10:20.478
What's wrong with you two?

10:20.503 --> 10:22.903
Well, 'cause we're staying
in the, uh, guest room.

10:22.928 --> 10:24.292
And, ah, the master is, uh...

10:24.327 --> 10:27.528
Full of spiders. Lousy with
spiders, spiders everywhere you look.

10:27.553 --> 10:28.811
Stop talking about them.

10:29.832 --> 10:31.252
I'll sleep on the couch.

10:32.100 --> 10:33.380
Why the three glasses?

10:33.405 --> 10:35.318
Ah... all for me.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.176
Argh! I have a problem.

10:42.998 --> 10:47.085
Okay, Dad's sleeping in the
living room, so just stay in here.

10:47.182 --> 10:50.506
I took a peek. He's just as
handsome as the day we met.

10:50.531 --> 10:52.297
You think he's still mad at me?

10:52.546 --> 10:54.468
Well, growing up, whenever
I mentioned your name,

10:54.493 --> 10:56.699
I'd have to put a quarter
in the "Bitch Jar"... and

10:58.193 --> 11:00.225
he still has it, so, ah...

11:00.250 --> 11:01.905
So I'm on his mind.

11:06.926 --> 11:08.286
Our grandmother is here?

11:08.311 --> 11:10.043
I've been wondering
about her my whole life.

11:10.068 --> 11:12.411
Yeah, she owes us,
like, a million presents.

11:13.811 --> 11:15.637
Look, your father's
gonna be here any minute.

11:15.662 --> 11:17.309
Climb out the window and drive home.

11:17.352 --> 11:19.512
- But we ran out of gas.
- And Dad always pumps it.

11:19.537 --> 11:22.016
Oh, God, we are disasters as parents.

11:22.212 --> 11:23.539
Martina, let me in.

11:23.564 --> 11:25.079
Damn it. Closet.

11:32.437 --> 11:33.671
Why'd you lock it?

11:33.696 --> 11:36.208
Oh, you know how these old doors are.

11:41.271 --> 11:42.489
That makes no sense.

11:43.236 --> 11:46.436
Anyways, now that we're finally alone,

11:46.461 --> 11:48.401
about that new stuff...

11:48.703 --> 11:50.902
How can there be new stuff
after all these years?

11:51.978 --> 11:54.667
If my childhood wasn't
already over, it's about to be.

11:55.482 --> 11:56.981
I don't know, Mike.

11:57.017 --> 11:59.493
I mean, your parents might hear.

11:59.518 --> 12:02.330
Look, so my parents are here,
but at least the girls aren't.

12:02.355 --> 12:05.721
I mean, we don't have
Shea whining about some boy

12:05.746 --> 12:07.806
or the heat death of the universe.

12:08.823 --> 12:10.420
It's inevitable, you know.

12:11.130 --> 12:15.002
And Stella, a failed sobriety
test in cutoff shorts.

12:15.124 --> 12:16.551
I sound fun.

12:17.491 --> 12:19.169
Let's not talk about
the girls right now.

12:19.204 --> 12:21.304
- Exactly.
- Okay, oh, how about this?

12:21.332 --> 12:24.928
You just wait here, while
I take a quick shower.

12:24.961 --> 12:27.968
Okay, I will be naked and waiting.

12:29.057 --> 12:30.261
Don't be naked.

12:30.286 --> 12:33.784
Um... be wearing your clothes, and...

12:33.809 --> 12:35.418
I will nudify you.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.492
Whatever the lady wants.

12:38.741 --> 12:41.352
Maybe we should have just
checked to see what the noise was.

13:02.868 --> 13:04.722
Oh, Bob.

13:04.986 --> 13:06.825
I've missed you.

13:12.114 --> 13:13.314
Linda?

13:14.291 --> 13:15.517
What year is it?

13:18.683 --> 13:21.774
Linda, what the hell are you doing here?

13:21.799 --> 13:24.112
Oh, shut up for a minute,
Bob, and let me look at you.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.358
You look good, real good.

13:26.556 --> 13:27.756
What about me?

13:27.781 --> 13:29.130
You want a compliment?

13:32.737 --> 13:34.740
I've been mad at you for 40 years.

13:34.765 --> 13:36.138
Oh, you were always mad at me.

13:36.163 --> 13:38.859
That's what's gonna make
the make-up sex so hot.

13:39.498 --> 13:40.747
Make-up sex?

13:40.772 --> 13:42.819
Don't mind if I do. You just
relax. I'll do all the work.

13:42.844 --> 13:44.693
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Linda.
- Bob.

13:44.718 --> 13:46.022
- Linda.
- Bob.

13:46.047 --> 13:48.884
What the [bleep] is going on here?

13:51.835 --> 13:53.920
Alice, I can explain.

13:54.468 --> 13:56.037
This must be your wife.

13:56.062 --> 13:57.904
I'm Bob's first wife, Linda.

13:57.929 --> 13:59.559
You're welcome to join us.

14:00.600 --> 14:04.174
There is nothing to join. I
just trying to get her off.

14:04.199 --> 14:05.399
What?

14:05.835 --> 14:07.977
Of me, off of me.

14:08.002 --> 14:10.255
- Oh, my God.
- What is happening here?

14:10.280 --> 14:11.645
Nothing's happening here.

14:11.670 --> 14:13.824
I was asleep, and she
climbed on top of me.

14:13.849 --> 14:16.189
Oh, hell no.

14:17.046 --> 14:19.179
Baby, hold my earrings.

14:19.204 --> 14:21.773
I'm about to knock this bitch out.

14:23.974 --> 14:25.174
What's going on?

14:25.199 --> 14:26.752
It's fine, girls. Go back to bed.

14:26.777 --> 14:28.105
What the hell?

14:29.597 --> 14:32.094
Yeah, what the hell
are you two doing here?

14:32.395 --> 14:33.627
You told them where we were?

14:33.652 --> 14:36.800
Well, they heard a scary noise.
It was like...

14:38.523 --> 14:39.727
No, it was more like...

14:41.180 --> 14:42.712
No, er, it was... it was more like...

14:47.461 --> 14:48.661
Got it.

14:48.744 --> 14:51.730
Wait, those are my granddaughters?

14:51.755 --> 14:53.957
No, those are my granddaughters.

14:53.982 --> 14:56.914
Everything in this cabin is mine.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.779
All right, look,

14:59.804 --> 15:01.412
many of us have our problems with Linda,

15:01.437 --> 15:04.301
and maybe she got off on the wrong
foot here. But I did reach out to her,

15:04.326 --> 15:08.428
and I think that I would like
to have her in my life again.

15:08.463 --> 15:12.003
So, Linda, are you gonna tell him
why that's not possible, or should I?

15:13.356 --> 15:14.700
What's he talking about?

15:14.974 --> 15:16.980
Something I was hoping
you'd never have to know.

15:17.005 --> 15:18.263
Bob, I'll tell him.

15:18.849 --> 15:20.886
Several years after
I left, I got involved

15:20.911 --> 15:23.170
with a group of people
who did some things,

15:23.195 --> 15:25.432
protest-y things.

15:25.573 --> 15:28.361
Nobody got hurt, but the
government said it was treasonous,

15:28.386 --> 15:30.932
but I think of it more as treason-ish.

15:32.453 --> 15:38.056
So I had a choice of either
going to jail or running away.

15:38.081 --> 15:40.504
So, what, are you gonna
just go back on the run now,

15:40.529 --> 15:42.332
- and this was all for nothing?
- No,

15:42.357 --> 15:44.239
I want to be part of your life again

15:44.264 --> 15:46.410
and get to know the girls and Martina.

15:46.435 --> 15:49.676
And maybe in time, I could even
be friends with Bob and Alice.

15:49.701 --> 15:50.901
Nope.

15:53.604 --> 15:55.052
How about this?

15:55.842 --> 15:57.375
I'll turn myself in.

15:58.105 --> 15:59.314
You'd do that?

15:59.339 --> 16:02.342
Yes, I would, first
thing tomorrow morning.

16:02.549 --> 16:04.950
I'll do my time, and when I get out,

16:05.589 --> 16:07.460
we can start again.

16:08.454 --> 16:09.948
I would like that.

16:10.485 --> 16:13.280
Well, it's been a big night,

16:13.305 --> 16:16.160
and it's gonna be a big morning,
so let's all get some sleep.

16:16.185 --> 16:18.234
Mm-hm, girls, grab some
sleeping bags out of the closet

16:18.259 --> 16:19.488
and go sleep in the kitchen.

16:19.513 --> 16:21.512
But I slept in the kitchen last night.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.701
- Come on, Mom.
- No way.

16:25.726 --> 16:27.850
I am backing your father up on this.

16:27.875 --> 16:30.368
You girls have come between
us for the last time.

16:31.102 --> 16:33.670
So probably not gonna happen tonight.

16:33.695 --> 16:34.966
Yeah, I don't think so.

16:45.275 --> 16:46.833
- Hey, Mike.
- Morning, Pop.

16:47.596 --> 16:48.838
Listen, I've been thinking.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.079
And I know it's not gonna be easy,

16:51.104 --> 16:52.845
but I think, ah, it's the right thing

16:52.870 --> 16:54.642
to try to work things out with Mom.

16:54.971 --> 16:57.735
- Look, son...
- 'Cause I know what you're gonna say...

16:57.760 --> 16:59.375
She's a liar. She's bad news.

16:59.416 --> 17:02.900
But I know that going into it, so I'm
not gonna expect too much and get hurt.

17:05.493 --> 17:07.226
She took off again, didn't she?

17:07.486 --> 17:09.647
Yeah, she's gone.

17:10.633 --> 17:11.934
I'm sorry, Mike.

17:13.195 --> 17:16.352
But at least this time
she left each of us a note.

17:17.853 --> 17:21.710
Given the context, mine was a
little sexually inappropriate,

17:24.233 --> 17:26.006
I can't read mine yet.

17:26.596 --> 17:31.980
Well, basically, she just
couldn't face going to jail.

17:32.359 --> 17:36.037
Well, I guess that's better
than leaving just because of us.

17:36.062 --> 17:37.290
It is.

17:37.507 --> 17:40.088
And, you know, it wasn't
all her fault back then.

17:40.396 --> 17:42.121
I wasn't the best husband.

17:42.888 --> 17:48.252
I mean, she had all these dreams and
ideas, and... I just didn't listen.

17:49.395 --> 17:51.144
I don't know if you're
aware of this, but sometimes

17:51.169 --> 17:52.597
I am a little too stubborn.

17:53.054 --> 17:54.262
I hadn't noticed.

17:56.348 --> 17:59.424
I didn't handle it too well
with you when your mother left.

17:59.449 --> 18:01.340
It was a tough day for you too.

18:01.754 --> 18:02.957
Yeah...

18:03.464 --> 18:05.434
but I wish I'd done things differently.

18:06.191 --> 18:09.398
Wish I'd said, "We'll get
through this together."

18:10.304 --> 18:14.580
And I should have told
you that, er, er, I...

18:15.890 --> 18:17.145
ah.

18:17.170 --> 18:18.370
What?

18:19.046 --> 18:22.125
Well, something I don't say enough....

18:22.150 --> 18:23.700
or maybe I never said it.

18:24.843 --> 18:26.524
I think it's the second one.

18:29.038 --> 18:30.610
So you know what it is.

18:31.983 --> 18:34.497
Oh, God. You're not going
to make me say it, are you?

18:34.522 --> 18:36.719
Yes, actually, I think
I'm gonna make you say it.

18:36.859 --> 18:38.059
Fine.

18:39.148 --> 18:40.348
Look,

18:41.389 --> 18:43.241
don't tell anyone I said this.

18:43.266 --> 18:44.466
Mmm.

18:44.967 --> 18:46.167
But...

18:47.381 --> 18:48.634
I love you.

18:49.573 --> 18:50.778
Okay.

18:51.574 --> 18:54.573
I will keep it a secret
that my father loves me.

18:55.941 --> 18:59.748
Well... you got something to say back?

19:00.400 --> 19:01.987
Mm. I love you too, Dad.

19:04.228 --> 19:05.881
We don't have to hug now, do we?

19:07.587 --> 19:09.931
Well, if we didn't do
it when the Seahawks

19:09.956 --> 19:12.355
won the Super Bowl,
why would we do it now?

19:13.477 --> 19:14.825
Good point.

19:18.173 --> 19:20.915
You know, I see you telling
your daughters you love them

19:20.940 --> 19:22.231
just about every day.

19:22.914 --> 19:24.510
I do it as much as I can.

19:25.852 --> 19:28.300
- Maybe I do it too much.
- No.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.723
No, you don't.

19:37.310 --> 19:40.989
I'm sorry I told Shea
and Stella where we were.

19:41.318 --> 19:42.528
I do coddle them.

19:42.553 --> 19:45.267
We both do, but maybe that's okay.

19:45.842 --> 19:47.373
They know that they're loved,

19:47.398 --> 19:49.167
and we know that they love us back.

19:49.192 --> 19:50.846
Yeah, and don't worry.

19:50.871 --> 19:53.437
- They'll move out, eventually.
- Will they?

19:54.777 --> 19:56.904
What are they doing that
will make that happen?

19:57.468 --> 20:00.812
They don't have jobs. They're
never gonna get their own place.

20:00.972 --> 20:03.001
So we need our own place,

20:03.538 --> 20:05.861
a space that's just for us.

20:07.845 --> 20:09.650
I have an idea.

20:11.014 --> 20:14.599
Oh, the shed. This is a great
idea. Nobody ever comes out here.

20:14.624 --> 20:17.620
We'll turn it into our
own little love shack.

20:17.645 --> 20:19.562
Hmmm, let's go look at our future.

20:22.927 --> 20:25.005
- Oh, my God.
- What the hell?

20:27.809 --> 20:29.285
Is this what I think it is?

20:29.310 --> 20:32.962
Course it's what you think it is.
It's a lot of what you think it is.

20:32.990 --> 20:35.916
- Did you leave the door open?
- No, I didn't leave the door open.

20:37.041 --> 20:39.827
- Uh-oh.
- What the hell is going on here?

20:40.241 --> 20:41.446
Well...

20:41.736 --> 20:43.325
we got jobs?

20:44.072 --> 20:46.480
Welcome to Operation: Project.

20:48.665 --> 20:49.939
It's weed.
