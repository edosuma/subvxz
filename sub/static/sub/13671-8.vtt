WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.240
'Previously on St Elsewhere...'

00:02.240 --> 00:05.040
How are the memoirs?
Going great.
I found you a steno.

00:05.040 --> 00:06.640
Meet John Doe.

00:06.640 --> 00:10.640
Have you seen John Doe?
That nitwit stole 333 of
the best pages of my life!

00:10.720 --> 00:11.640
I want to come back.

00:11.640 --> 00:13.760
I want to come back.

00:13.760 --> 00:17.760
You can get through there and into
the North-Eastern PA programme in
just two years.

00:17.800 --> 00:21.800
Community service assignment,
Mr Morrison. You start today
at the Newcastle Penitentiary.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.920
Dr Morrison!
I'm sorry, what?

01:57.920 --> 01:59.360
Are you all right?
Yes, sir.

01:59.360 --> 02:02.200
Good. If you're through contemplating
the mysteries of the universe,

02:02.200 --> 02:04.120
would you mind presenting
the next case?

02:04.120 --> 02:06.320
Next case.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.400
Mr Ansary.

02:08.400 --> 02:12.400
Uh...white male,
45, global aphasia.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.080
Seems like old times
with Boomer.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.000
You think
he's got problems?

02:18.000 --> 02:20.880
I've been spending all day doing
litmus tests on people's urine.

02:20.880 --> 02:23.120
Oh, really?
Business or pleasure?

02:23.120 --> 02:26.640
I've been tapped by the mucky mucks
to supervise a kidney tapping.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.560
Oh, yeah.
Looking for drugs.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.000
In all the wrong places.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.400
Well, I think you can
handle it, Victor.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.280
Just treat the staff
with sensitivity.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.400
Don't jerk them
around.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.320
Mark, your breakfast
is getting cold.
Coming.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.520
Yes. I'm waiting
for Officer Down.

02:42.520 --> 02:46.520
He's to meet me at my office
at St Eligius, ten o'clock.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.720
My book was stolen.

02:48.720 --> 02:51.600
What do you mean,
buy another one?

02:51.600 --> 02:53.520
What's your name,
flatfoot?

02:53.520 --> 02:57.520
Hello? Hello?

03:02.320 --> 03:06.160
So happy I am
to cook for you my Russian
holiday breakfast.

03:06.160 --> 03:09.320
It smells delicious.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.680
Who's she?

03:10.680 --> 03:12.040
Masha,
our new housekeeper.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.200
I told you
yesterday.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.640
What happened
to Natasha?

03:14.640 --> 03:16.000
Moved to
Frostbite Falls.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.480
Got a job with
the Minnesota Symphony.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.280
Oh, boy, Ellen.

03:20.280 --> 03:24.280
Emma Lazarus didn't
welcome as many
immigrants as we do.

03:24.280 --> 03:25.600
What are you doing?

03:25.600 --> 03:28.200
Good for Barbara.
Make her strong.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.760
Not on your life.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.640
Barbara's strictly
a Gerber baby.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.280
A little potato won't hurt.

03:33.280 --> 03:36.680
She'll grow up
looking like one of those
lady discus throwers

03:36.680 --> 03:38.200
with an extra chromosome.

03:38.200 --> 03:41.040
I get you
fresh coffee.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.440
Just because John Doe
stole your book,

03:43.440 --> 03:46.120
doesn't mean you can take it out
on the rest of us.

03:46.120 --> 03:48.520
Give me one good reason
why not.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.960
Until that manuscript's
returned,

03:49.960 --> 03:52.520
I'm not sleeping easy,
and neither are you.

03:52.520 --> 03:55.880
Well, at least try to be nicer
to Marsha than you were to Natasha.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.640
Say that
five times fast.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.400
Craig family beautiful.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.320
Yuri and I used to
have breakfast,

04:03.320 --> 04:04.760
fight over
little things.

04:04.760 --> 04:06.520
I miss him so much.

04:06.520 --> 04:07.960
What did he do,

04:07.960 --> 04:10.000
sweep the steps
at Lenin's tomb?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.480
Surgeon like you.

04:11.480 --> 04:12.920
Hardly.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.720
Barbara, don't play
with your herring.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.120
Very famous.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.600
Why won't they let
him emigrate?

04:18.600 --> 04:19.880
To punish us.

04:19.880 --> 04:23.240
Oh, if only Yuri
was here with me.

04:23.240 --> 04:26.040
Yes, well, I'd like to stay and
listen to this Soviet sob story,

04:26.040 --> 04:28.960
but I've got to get
to the hospital

04:28.960 --> 04:30.400
and meet Officer Down.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.800
But tomorrow I'll be here all day

04:31.800 --> 04:34.320
to help get this house
back in order.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.360
Don't forget, Mark,
I'm having Joanne Morrison
to lunch tomorrow.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.200
In that case, I'll go to the movies.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.480
Why did you invite her, anyway?

04:40.480 --> 04:42.560
You know,
welcome wagon.

04:42.560 --> 04:45.520
I hope she talks
faster than her husband

04:45.520 --> 04:47.880
or she'll still
be here for dinner.

04:47.880 --> 04:51.880
Farina for you,
young lady.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.880
So you condone
drug abuse?

04:59.880 --> 05:01.320
Oh, Lucy,
that's not what I'm saying.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.240
Well, then, why are you
against testing?

05:03.240 --> 05:05.640
Look, I haven't
committed any crime.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.080
Mandatory drug testing

05:07.080 --> 05:09.960
is like frisking everybody
in the supermarket

05:09.960 --> 05:11.880
because some of them
might be shoplifters.

05:11.880 --> 05:15.720
6% of all nurses
in this country
are drug addicts.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.160
When are
they testing us?

05:17.160 --> 05:18.200
Tomorrow afternoon.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.040
Orderlies today,
doctors next week.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.440
If they're really serious
about catching abusers,

05:22.440 --> 05:25.160
why did they announce
this farce in advance?

05:25.160 --> 05:26.440
Addicts are
self-destructive.

05:26.440 --> 05:28.320
They're not going to stop
using drugs

05:28.320 --> 05:30.240
just because they know there's
a test coming up.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.160
You don't kick a habit
without help.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.440
I think the drug testing's
a good idea.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.520
You're in favour?

05:34.520 --> 05:35.840
Yeah, sure.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.560
Excuse me, I have to run
to the ladies' room.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.680
A little honeymoon cystitis.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.120
Drinking
cranberry juice?

05:41.120 --> 05:42.160
Gallons.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.520
Lay off the coffee.

05:43.520 --> 05:44.560
No kidding.

05:44.560 --> 05:48.560
Now, there's a truly
dangerous drug - caffeine.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.200
Let me tell you
something, Lucy.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.120
If I was still head nurse,

05:53.120 --> 05:54.520
I wouldn't put my girls
through this.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.000
You're not
head nurse.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.920
I am. And you don't have
a choice.

05:57.920 --> 06:00.360
Yes, I do. I won't take
the test.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.640
You'll be suspended.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.480
They wouldn't do that to me.

06:03.480 --> 06:07.480
Don't bet
your job on it, Helen.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.200
Daniel, I understand patients
have to feel

06:10.200 --> 06:13.080
that the people taking care of them
are trustworthy, I know that, but...

06:13.080 --> 06:16.440
Drug testing will also lower
our insurance premiums, which have
sky-rocketed.

06:16.440 --> 06:20.440
Officer Down from
area D stopped by.

06:21.240 --> 06:23.200
Testing is
the board's idea.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.080
I just don't think
it's right

06:25.080 --> 06:26.520
kowtowing to
an insurance company.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.400
I told him to call out the rest of
the alphabet and get back to me.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.760
Drug screening makes both
ethical and physical sense,

06:32.760 --> 06:34.640
a rare combination.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.560
Here we are.
Scene of the crime.

06:37.560 --> 06:41.400
Office Down found a page of my book
at the bus depot.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.480
Any idea of the
whereabouts of John Doe?

06:43.480 --> 06:45.000
Not yet.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.880
But these gumshoes
say justice is
just around the corner.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.160
Back to work.

06:49.160 --> 06:52.120
See you.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.400
Dr Auschlander.

06:53.400 --> 06:54.560
Luther! Who died?

06:54.560 --> 06:55.800
Nobody yet,
because I'm on the job.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.200
Why the tie?

06:57.200 --> 06:58.640
It makes me feel
more professional

06:58.640 --> 07:00.080
and people respect me more.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.000
I checked
on your patient, Cindy Cation.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.800
You asked me to take a history,
find out about her angina,
how many episodes? 100

07:05.800 --> 07:06.880
A marathoner.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.720
With luck,
she'll run for ever.

07:08.720 --> 07:09.800
What would you like me
to do next?

07:09.800 --> 07:11.240
This isn't
strictly medical,

07:11.240 --> 07:13.200
but it would be
worthwhile

07:13.200 --> 07:15.600
if you were to orchestrate
a show for the tots in paediatrics.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.440
I'm no Paul Shaffer,
but I'll see what I can do.

07:18.440 --> 07:19.920
Who's Paul Shaffer?

07:19.920 --> 07:23.000
I don't know.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
I'm really depressed about
this past weekend. I was hoping
to get up to Burlington.

07:27.760 --> 07:30.160
Got a Vermont maid
hidden away, Elliot?

07:30.160 --> 07:33.520
No, my second cousin Rees was there.
He used to sell firewood.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.880
Now he's back working
for his parents.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.800
He couldn't
cut the cord.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.720
What would you
do there?

07:39.720 --> 07:41.160
See the leaves.

07:41.160 --> 07:44.000
The foliage hotline
said the colour is peaking.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.480
Don't say the colour is peaking.

07:45.480 --> 07:49.480
It leaves an acidic
taste in my mouth.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.080
Where is everybody?

07:51.080 --> 07:52.680
This is 3204, right?

07:52.680 --> 07:53.960
Yep.

07:53.960 --> 07:57.960
Must be early.

07:58.120 --> 08:01.000
Um...you'll probably
want to be leaving, kid,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.880
because we're going to have
a medical lecture in here.

08:03.880 --> 08:07.880
I know.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.400
There's a height
requirement.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.960
Look, sonny, everyone
in this room

08:12.960 --> 08:14.880
is a doctor,
an adult,

08:14.880 --> 08:18.880
so, you know, take a hike.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.800
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.240
Settle in, please.

08:22.240 --> 08:25.120
We've got a lot to cover today
before we head on rounds.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.040
An announcement
before we begin.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.760
Please welcome our new
medical student, Owen Drimmer.

08:29.760 --> 08:33.760
Hi.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.600
This is a pain
in the drain.

08:38.600 --> 08:42.600
Drain into this.

08:45.560 --> 08:47.600
No. Leave the door open.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.240
What, are you into watching?

08:49.240 --> 08:52.320
I just want to make sure what you
give me is yours, all yours and
nothing but yours.

08:52.320 --> 08:53.960
Who else's?

08:53.960 --> 08:55.800
They'll try and slip
anything by -

08:55.800 --> 08:57.720
beer, apple juice,
ginger ale.

08:57.720 --> 08:59.640
They just add water
and serve.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.040
They try bringing
their neighbour's urine.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.440
One guy gave me
his sister's.

09:04.440 --> 09:06.360
Test showed
he was pregnant.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.640
So, go ahead.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.520
I can't do this when somebody's
watching. Not even when
somebody's in the next room.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.920
I always
run the faucet.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.600
Fine. Think fluid.

09:15.600 --> 09:18.640
Think Niagara Falls,
Walden Pond,

09:18.640 --> 09:20.400
Veronica Lake,
Joan Rivers.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.800
OK, OK,
I get the picture.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.800
I'm flowing.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.440
Make sure it's warm.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.000
Better be warm
or I'm in trouble.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.120
Steaming.

09:35.120 --> 09:39.120
Proves this is your
very own bodily fluid.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.480
He's going to seal the container
with evidence tape,

09:46.480 --> 09:47.760
initial the tape,

09:47.760 --> 09:50.440
put the sealed container
in this envelope, initial it.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.840
It's called
a chain of custody.

09:52.840 --> 09:55.160
Somebody'll pick this up,
sign, zoom it over to the lab,
they'll sign.

09:55.160 --> 09:58.960
We want to know where your urine is
and who's got it at all times.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.640
This is one thing I like to do

10:00.640 --> 10:02.960
right before
your very eyes.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.160
What does that prove?

10:05.160 --> 10:07.080
It proves you gave me urine
and not Rolling Rock.

10:07.080 --> 10:11.080
If I could whizz beer,
I'd be in the brewery business.

10:15.960 --> 10:19.080
Mrs, Bushnail, I've missed.
I'll try again.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.520
That hurts, young man.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.400
Why don't you give me
Xylocaine first?

10:22.400 --> 10:23.840
It causes swelling.

10:23.840 --> 10:27.720
Makes the artery
harder to find.

10:27.720 --> 10:30.120
Boy, I wish there was
a machine

10:30.120 --> 10:32.760
that would make you feel
what I feel.

10:32.760 --> 10:36.200
You'd be more careful.

10:36.200 --> 10:40.200
Where did you go
to medical school,
Grenada?

10:42.400 --> 10:43.840
Sorry that pinched.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.440
Sorry's all I ever hear.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.240
Let me tell you, young man,
sorry don't make it.

10:48.240 --> 10:52.240
You're right.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.080
So, Elliot, they put you
in charge of chaperoning Owen?

11:27.080 --> 11:28.920
Yeah.

11:28.920 --> 11:31.320
What's the going rate
for babysitters these days?
¤2.00, ¤2.50?

11:31.320 --> 11:33.640
Why me? Why is
it always me?

11:33.640 --> 11:36.240
They take advantage
of my good nature around here.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.680
Hey, Owen...

11:38.680 --> 11:42.040
So 14 and pre-med?
You must've skipped a couple.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.160
High school.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.600
Homecoming, senior prom,
the whole enchilada?

11:45.600 --> 11:47.800
Yeah, well,
after I finished

11:47.800 --> 11:49.240
Einstein's unified
field theory...

11:49.240 --> 11:50.680
How old
were you?

11:50.680 --> 11:51.800
12.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.240
I went straight
to junior college

11:53.240 --> 11:54.680
and then BU pre-med.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.600
That wasn't a big deal.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.920
This is a big deal.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.120
St Eligius?

11:59.120 --> 12:01.520
Yeah. Are you kidding?
Working with real doctors.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.080
Hands-on medicine.
Helping people.

12:04.080 --> 12:07.440
And I get to wear
this neat white coat.

12:07.440 --> 12:11.440
Are we ready
for rounds?

12:11.600 --> 12:13.200
First case,
Henry Stevens.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.240
Should we consider
pulmonary embolus? Anyone?

12:16.240 --> 12:19.080
There's no
pleuritic component
to his chest pain.

12:19.080 --> 12:22.360
But is it always
present in cases
of pulmonary embolus?

12:22.360 --> 12:24.560
With his dyspnea chest pain
and tachycardia,

12:24.560 --> 12:27.880
I suggest we do
a pulmonary angio
to be sure.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.200
Elliot, excellent.

12:29.200 --> 12:33.200
Next case, Liza Van.
Seth, any changes in
her liver function test?

12:34.520 --> 12:38.520
You've got to learn to stay on
your feet, just like that, if you
want to make it in this hospital.

12:38.640 --> 12:39.720
I know.

12:39.720 --> 12:42.080
Course of treatment,
Owen?

12:42.080 --> 12:43.400
Well...

12:43.400 --> 12:46.280
if the patient continues
experiencing abdominal pain,

12:46.280 --> 12:48.200
then an ultrasound
should be done

12:48.200 --> 12:50.600
to check for dilation of
the common bile duct

12:50.600 --> 12:52.040
or evidence of stones.

12:52.040 --> 12:56.040
Very good.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.200
Hi, Liza.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.920
It's Lisa,
with an S.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.840
Another
unveiling?

13:04.840 --> 13:07.720
I'm sorry. I know this is
tiresome for you.

13:07.720 --> 13:11.400
Please put out
your cigarette.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.520
Every day.

13:12.520 --> 13:16.520
I'm beginning to feel
like Gypsy Rose Lisa.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.240
Breasts...

13:19.240 --> 13:21.680
I see you passed
Anatomy 101.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.680
Seth, would you
do the honours?

13:23.680 --> 13:27.680
Sure.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.880
Definite distended
gall bladder.

13:30.880 --> 13:34.880
Owen, do you think
an ERCP would be
advisable at this time?

13:39.040 --> 13:40.720
Why is he
staring at me?

13:40.720 --> 13:43.200
What's a 13-year-old
boy doing in my room anyway?

13:43.200 --> 13:45.800
I can assure you
he's totally qualified.

13:45.800 --> 13:49.240
I'm a medical student,
and I'm 14.

13:49.240 --> 13:50.680
How about I'll loan
you ¤3.50,

13:50.680 --> 13:54.440
and you go
hyperventilate
over a Playboy?

13:54.440 --> 13:55.800
Everyone, please.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.400
Despite Owen's
age difference,

13:57.400 --> 13:59.400
we'll treat one another
with respect

13:59.400 --> 14:01.280
and as peers
and colleagues.

14:01.280 --> 14:05.280
Owen, would you present
the next case, please?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.280
Boomer, how's
married life treating you?

14:16.280 --> 14:18.520
Still in
phase one bliss?

14:18.520 --> 14:22.320
Yeah, it's fine.
It's great.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.280
Phil, you ever
hallucinate?

14:24.280 --> 14:27.760
Not since college.

14:27.760 --> 14:30.840
I saw something today
I couldn't have seen.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.440
What? Peter White?

14:32.440 --> 14:34.480
No, not quite.
Nick Moats.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.120
Doesn't ring a bell.

14:36.120 --> 14:40.120
Newcastle prison,
the convict.

14:40.440 --> 14:43.480
Sometimes I think
I see somebody I know,

14:43.480 --> 14:45.360
maybe my brother, I go up to them,

14:45.360 --> 14:47.280
and they're
total strangers.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.080
It's embarrassing.

14:49.080 --> 14:52.080
I didn't see somebody
that looked like Moats.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.000
I hallucinated the whole thing.
There was nobody there at all.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.320
Hey, listen.
You got
a new family,

14:57.320 --> 14:59.440
you're
a stepfather,

14:59.440 --> 15:01.040
that's a lot
of adjustment.

15:01.040 --> 15:04.240
Joanne and the kids are the
best part of my life.

15:04.240 --> 15:08.240
I go home,
I feel grounded.

15:08.680 --> 15:12.680
I'm just a little
stressed out now,
overworked.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.880
I think you're
doing great

15:15.880 --> 15:18.280
putting the pieces
back together, Boomer.

15:18.280 --> 15:21.840
(BEEPER)

15:21.840 --> 15:23.600
Got to run.

15:23.600 --> 15:27.400
Take care
of yourself.

15:27.400 --> 15:30.600
Nick Moats.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.840
Your chart indicates

15:32.840 --> 15:35.240
that you're due for
another 50 milligrams...

15:35.240 --> 15:36.680
30 minutes ago.

15:36.680 --> 15:39.880
The last one's wearing off fast.
I'm in a world of hurt.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.920
I'll tell the nurses
you're up next.

15:41.920 --> 15:44.840
Thank you. You're
so much more gentle

15:44.840 --> 15:47.200
than that tall, curly-haired
resident was.

15:47.200 --> 15:48.280
Dr who?

15:48.280 --> 15:49.640
Morse, Morrison...

15:49.640 --> 15:51.240
I can never
remember which.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.160
We don't want to get you
used to painkillers.

15:53.160 --> 15:56.200
We don't want
to send you home
with a habit.

15:56.200 --> 16:00.200
See you later.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.560
Hi.
Hi.

16:02.560 --> 16:03.680
She's complaining.

16:03.680 --> 16:04.960
She's
very uncomfortable.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.400
McPhail's
administering her meds.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.320
I'll have her do
the next round

16:08.320 --> 16:10.240
when she gets back from break -
late again.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.840
I think we should
help this lady deal
with her pain.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.560
I don't want her building up
a tolerance to these drugs.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.840
I get you.
She's a whiner.

16:16.840 --> 16:18.240
Hypersensitive.
I don't understand.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.160
That dosage should
be sufficient.

16:20.160 --> 16:23.680
Do you have a minute?
I want to ask you something
about the drug testing.

16:23.680 --> 16:27.680
Can it wait?
That's Daniel's
territory anyway. Sorry.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.920
Kids are all down...

16:32.920 --> 16:34.520
at last.

16:34.520 --> 16:37.240
Christopher asked me
about Caitlin's period.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.640
What did you tell him?

16:39.640 --> 16:43.640
I told him
to ask his mother.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.560
Sixth grade health class.

16:45.560 --> 16:48.920
They put the boys
in a room by themselves,

16:48.920 --> 16:51.800
and this old
German guy comes in

16:51.800 --> 16:54.200
and shows us slides
about menstruation.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.640
All very abstract.

16:55.640 --> 16:59.640
I didn't
understand a word.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.480
What should I wear
to Mrs Craig's?

17:03.480 --> 17:05.079
A dress.

17:05.079 --> 17:06.480
Which one?

17:06.480 --> 17:08.280
I don't care.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.000
Sleepy?

17:10.000 --> 17:13.079
Yeah, I'm beat.
Are you?

17:13.079 --> 17:16.720
No.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.800
Just how tired
are you?

17:18.800 --> 17:19.920
Joanne...

17:19.920 --> 17:22.160
it's been
a long day.

17:22.160 --> 17:25.520
So what else is new?

17:25.520 --> 17:26.680
Jack...

17:26.680 --> 17:29.080
do you know
how many times

17:29.080 --> 17:32.400
we made love
last month?

17:32.400 --> 17:34.000
I don't count.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.480
Well, I do.

17:35.480 --> 17:38.160
Twice.

17:38.160 --> 17:41.840
And even then you
were somewhere else.

17:41.840 --> 17:44.240
Well, I'm tired.
I'm not sleeping.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.120
You stay awake
all night

17:46.120 --> 17:50.120
staring at the ceiling
so hard I can hear you.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.680
What's the matter?

17:52.680 --> 17:54.280
Nothing.

17:54.280 --> 17:56.520
Is work all right?

17:56.520 --> 17:57.840
Yes.

17:57.840 --> 18:01.840
Work is fine.
Life is great.

18:03.880 --> 18:07.280
Are you worried that
I'm going to embarrass you
at the Craigs'?

18:07.280 --> 18:08.680
Don't be stupid.

18:08.680 --> 18:11.560
Why are you putting
more pressure on me?

18:11.560 --> 18:15.560
Joanne, it's the last
thing I need.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.560
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Yeah?

18:33.560 --> 18:37.000
Dr Craig...
Yeah?
..uh...you busy?

18:37.000 --> 18:39.160
I'm practising
prestidigitation.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.040
Looks like magic
to me.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.600
For my manual dexterity.

18:42.600 --> 18:46.600
I've gotten quite
proficient. Watch this.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.080
Hey, that's great.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.840
I can do a trick.
Really?

18:56.840 --> 18:58.280
Just this morning,

18:58.280 --> 19:00.160
I walked
around the corner

19:00.160 --> 19:02.080
and turned
into a Minimart.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.680
Empty the trash
and beat it.

19:04.680 --> 19:07.160
You know
I'm organising a show

19:07.160 --> 19:08.560
in paediatrics today.

19:08.560 --> 19:09.840
Good for you.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.040
The kids would
love your magic.

19:12.040 --> 19:15.320
Not a chance. I'd be
pelted with Gummi bears.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.120
Don't say no
till you think about it.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.200
Tonight? 7.30?

19:19.200 --> 19:20.480
I won't be there.

19:20.480 --> 19:24.480
We won't start
without you.

19:25.920 --> 19:27.040
Ta-da!

19:27.040 --> 19:28.160
Hey...

19:28.160 --> 19:29.280
What time?

19:29.280 --> 19:30.560
7.30.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.000
You won't regret this.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.880
I regret everything.

19:35.880 --> 19:38.720
So, if there's a shrinking of
the surface and edges of the tongue,

19:38.720 --> 19:40.160
it indicates
pernicious anaemia.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.080
The bright red
patches indicate...

19:42.080 --> 19:44.000
Owen, please,
enough shoptalk. OK?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.800
OK. Where to now?

19:45.800 --> 19:46.880
On call.

19:46.880 --> 19:47.920
What for?

19:47.920 --> 19:48.960
40 winks.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.240
I'm not tired.

19:50.240 --> 19:53.080
I am. I've been
up for 36 hours.

19:53.080 --> 19:57.080
Darn. Full house.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.320
Hey, watch it.

19:59.320 --> 20:02.680
Sorry.

20:02.680 --> 20:05.880
I've just
never seen a case
of glossitis before.

20:05.880 --> 20:07.640
Her tongue
was all swollen.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.560
It won't be
your last.

20:09.560 --> 20:11.480
What's the drug
of choice for treatment?

20:11.480 --> 20:14.520
What are you asking me for?
You already know the answer.

20:14.520 --> 20:16.640
I have
a photographic memory.

20:16.640 --> 20:20.640
Yeah, for mammaries.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.680
Oh, no.

20:22.680 --> 20:23.960
Call a code.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.120
What's a code?

20:25.120 --> 20:29.120
Stop this thing. Get a nurse
and have her call a code.

20:35.440 --> 20:36.880
Call a code.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.360
Who are you?

20:38.360 --> 20:39.440
Call a code! Please!

20:39.440 --> 20:42.120
Listen, you little squirt, I don't
know what you're up to or where you
scored that ID...

20:42.120 --> 20:44.360
Lucy, code blue, stat!

20:44.360 --> 20:46.160
Code blue.

20:46.160 --> 20:48.800
Take over
on compressions.
I'll breathe him.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.880
What?
You do know CPR,
right?

20:50.880 --> 20:52.120
Yeah, I think so.

20:52.120 --> 20:55.120
Then come down here
and give me a hand.

20:55.120 --> 20:59.120
Now, you little
worm, now!

21:00.720 --> 21:02.600
Come on, Owen, like you
really mean it.

21:02.600 --> 21:06.600
You're trying to save
this guy's life.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.600
Hook him up.
Ventilate him
with the ambu-bag.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.480
One for every
five compressions.

21:15.480 --> 21:17.480
Two amps bicarb,
get some eppie ready

21:17.480 --> 21:20.840
and start a lidocaine drip.
Come on, people, let's move.
We're losing him!

21:20.840 --> 21:23.400
I don't know
what you're saying.

21:23.400 --> 21:27.400
I don't know
what to do.

21:30.760 --> 21:34.760
I knew I should've
taken the stairs.

21:38.480 --> 21:42.480
Here we are.

21:42.680 --> 21:45.520
Decaf for me,
constant comment for you.

21:45.520 --> 21:46.680
Thanks.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.520
Mark and I are
both coffee drinkers.

21:49.520 --> 21:50.960
Once in a while

21:50.960 --> 21:52.440
he'll have
some chamomile

21:52.440 --> 21:54.320
just to settle
his stomach.

21:54.320 --> 21:55.760
Speaking of health food,

21:55.760 --> 21:57.080
have a designer cookie.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.160
Well...

21:58.160 --> 22:01.080
Come on. They're too good.
They're Italian.

22:01.080 --> 22:02.520
Well, twist my arm.

22:02.520 --> 22:05.240
Why is your yard
all torn up?

22:05.240 --> 22:07.120
The gardener's
resodding the back.

22:07.120 --> 22:10.800
He's putting in some
kind of plot device.

22:10.800 --> 22:14.800
Now, how does the life
of a doctor's wife suit you?

22:15.280 --> 22:16.720
These are too delicious.

22:16.720 --> 22:20.720
Well, Jack warned me,
but I didn't realise

22:22.760 --> 22:24.560
how tough the schedule
would be.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.160
Do you ever
get used to the hours?

22:26.160 --> 22:29.280
No. When I was
pregnant with Stephen,

22:29.280 --> 22:31.520
Mark was a resident,
I didn't see him for days on end.

22:31.520 --> 22:34.080
Sometimes when Jack
gets home, he is so wound up.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.360
Mark, too.

22:35.360 --> 22:38.080
Especially
if an operation
doesn't go his way.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.320
Jack just withdraws.

22:39.320 --> 22:43.320
Lately, he has
been so remote.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.560
He seems to be coping very well.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.200
After all, it isn't that long.

22:47.200 --> 22:50.080
He swears he's
over Nina's death and...

22:50.080 --> 22:52.160
No, I didn't mean Nina.

22:52.160 --> 22:56.160
I mean what happened
to him in prison.

22:56.320 --> 23:00.320
Jack was in prison?

23:10.320 --> 23:12.840
He's spacey,
self-doubting, inefficient.

23:12.840 --> 23:13.920
Who are we talking about?

23:13.920 --> 23:15.080
Boomer. Hi.

23:15.080 --> 23:17.040
Hi.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.160
Who's Boomer?

23:18.160 --> 23:19.280
Jack Morrison.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.680
Why do you
call him Boomer?

23:21.680 --> 23:23.120
I don't remember.

23:23.120 --> 23:25.720
It's something to do
about a dog.

23:25.720 --> 23:28.200
He's getting fragged
in the matrimonial trenches.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.240
Take it from a veteran
of conjugal campaigns.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.640
Right. You were married
all of a whole month.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.560
16 days,
but I learned.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.520
How many times you got to
put your finger in the socket

23:36.520 --> 23:38.000
before you figure out
the current is hot.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.960
There's something definitely
wrong with him.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.800
He's started dropping
the baton again.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.200
He's not
even in the race.

23:43.200 --> 23:46.120
It's been six months
since the rape.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.520
He raped somebody?

23:47.520 --> 23:49.920
Uh-uh. Other way
around. He received.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.040
That's just a rumour.

23:52.040 --> 23:53.680
Don't kid yourself.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.640
Gossip! Nobody
knows for sure.

23:56.640 --> 23:57.560
Where?

23:57.560 --> 23:59.040
Newcastle Penitentiary.

23:59.040 --> 24:01.520
Has anybody bothered
to ask him

24:01.520 --> 24:02.960
what really happened?

24:02.960 --> 24:04.040
Oh, sure.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.120
"Is it true that a couple
of big, burly convicts
had their way with you?"

24:06.120 --> 24:07.360
Victor!

24:07.360 --> 24:08.400
Jackie.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.440
He's coming apart at the seams.

24:10.440 --> 24:13.120
He told me he thought he saw the con
who did the dirty deed.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.800
Oh, shoot. Here comes
Dr Westphall.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.320
I've been avoiding him.

24:16.320 --> 24:17.440
Dr Westphall!

24:17.440 --> 24:21.440
Dr Griffin, I'd like to see you in
my office this afternoon. A couple
of things we have to sort out.

24:24.040 --> 24:27.000
Right now I'd rather be
in Boomer's shoes.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.640
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

24:29.640 --> 24:31.440
Is that
a new hairdo?

24:31.440 --> 24:32.520
Absolutely not.

24:32.520 --> 24:33.920
Looks different
every week.

24:33.920 --> 24:36.840
Daniel, I've got something to
say. My drug screening
is this afternoon.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.800
I'm not
taking the test.

24:39.800 --> 24:40.920
Why?

24:40.920 --> 24:42.360
Why should I?

24:42.360 --> 24:46.360
Now, Helen, the hospital
needs testing.

24:47.080 --> 24:50.440
There have been several
incidents city-wide involving
orderlies and nurses.

24:50.440 --> 24:51.520
And doctors.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.480
Accidents caused
by chemical intoxication.

24:53.480 --> 24:55.480
You'd be naive
to suppose otherwise.

24:55.480 --> 24:58.080
You're calling me
childish?
Of course not!

24:58.080 --> 25:00.160
I'm for testing, if there's
evidence of abuse.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.560
But to help,
not to punish.

25:02.560 --> 25:04.960
What you're doing
is terrifying everybody.

25:04.960 --> 25:08.960
The hospital's
collective BP is way up.

25:10.560 --> 25:12.680
The common good
of St Eligius

25:12.680 --> 25:16.680
outweighs the right
of the individual.

25:17.320 --> 25:19.880
If you don't take
the test,

25:19.880 --> 25:21.320
we'll suspend you.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.360
Would you really
do that to me, Daniel?

25:24.360 --> 25:26.080
What choice
would I have?

25:26.080 --> 25:28.160
None.

25:28.160 --> 25:32.160
Suspend me.

25:35.440 --> 25:36.880
Here he comes.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.680
Faster, faster.

25:38.680 --> 25:39.960
Car crash!

25:39.960 --> 25:42.800
Emergency vehicle
in the clear.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.560
Oh, no! You hurt
the emergency
vehicle.

25:45.560 --> 25:46.680
Nippy out.

25:46.680 --> 25:47.800
Hello.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.240
How was your day?

25:49.240 --> 25:51.560
Oh, more of the same.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.560
I saw Ellen Craig
today.

25:53.560 --> 25:55.080
Oh, yeah. How was your lunch?

25:55.080 --> 25:57.000
Where's
Chris and Caitlin?

25:57.000 --> 25:58.400
In their rooms.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.360
We still going
to Sal's for pizza?

26:00.360 --> 26:04.360
I need some time
alone with you
before dinner.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.600
Jack?

26:05.600 --> 26:07.760
Jack, we need
to talk.

26:07.760 --> 26:11.320
OK, talk. What's the matter?
Has Pete been a bad egg?

26:11.320 --> 26:12.960
No. Pete's an angel.

26:12.960 --> 26:14.120
Good.

26:14.120 --> 26:17.040
Jack, Ellen
told me that...

26:17.040 --> 26:19.560
I really don't know how
to say this.

26:19.560 --> 26:20.680
Sounds serious.

26:20.680 --> 26:23.280
Yeah.

26:23.280 --> 26:26.160
Ellen told me
that you were...

26:26.160 --> 26:27.280
Caitlin, please!

26:27.280 --> 26:29.400
I asked you to stay
in your room!

26:29.400 --> 26:31.240
Hi, Jack.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.840
How's it going, kiddo?
How was school?

26:32.840 --> 26:33.920
School's OK.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.320
What did you do today?

26:35.320 --> 26:38.400
Nothing, except
Mom's acting really weird.

26:38.400 --> 26:40.160
We're having a little discussion.
Maybe you ought...

26:40.160 --> 26:42.200
Oh, OK,
but I'm starving.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.600
We'll be in
in a jiffy.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.520
OK. Great. I want that thick crust
with extra sausage.

26:47.520 --> 26:50.320
Gotcha. What's up?

26:50.320 --> 26:52.080
Were you in prison?

26:52.080 --> 26:55.800
No. Outreach programme,
community service.

26:55.800 --> 26:59.800
I worked
in the prison clinic.
Oh.

26:59.960 --> 27:01.880
Well, I got so worried

27:01.880 --> 27:04.720
because, all of a sudden,
she dropped the subject.

27:04.720 --> 27:07.120
Well, it's nothing
to concern you.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.640
Caitlin, Chris,
it's time for pizza.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.080
She looked
so uncomfortable.

27:11.080 --> 27:15.080
I mean, why did she
drop the subject, Jack?

27:15.080 --> 27:16.440
Maybe she was embarrassed.

27:16.440 --> 27:19.400
I got into a fight,
a little beat up, that's all.

27:19.400 --> 27:20.960
OK?

27:20.960 --> 27:22.240
Nothing happened.

27:22.240 --> 27:23.400
OK?

27:23.400 --> 27:24.480
OK.

27:24.480 --> 27:28.480
OK.

27:32.920 --> 27:35.240
Watch this one.

27:35.240 --> 27:37.000
What do you see?

27:37.000 --> 27:38.680
Size 7 3/8.

27:38.680 --> 27:41.160
OK.

27:41.160 --> 27:45.160
Nothing up my sleeves.

27:50.760 --> 27:52.720
Nothing in my hat.

27:52.720 --> 27:54.040
Let me try it again.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.640
I thinking of buying a car.

27:55.640 --> 27:58.480
I've got to get this down
before I entertain the kiddies.

27:58.480 --> 28:01.400
One of those T-birds
with the cute little portholes.

28:01.400 --> 28:04.640
You'll have to dig
into your pension plan
to pay for that.

28:04.640 --> 28:05.920
I shouldn't think so.

28:05.920 --> 28:08.600
That car is a classic.

28:08.600 --> 28:10.160
Too soon to tell,

28:10.160 --> 28:12.040
but they are
rather nice.

28:12.040 --> 28:13.840
(TELEPHONE BUZZES)

28:13.840 --> 28:14.960
Hello.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.200
Yes.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.560
They're waiting for you
in paediatrics.

28:19.560 --> 28:20.680
Wait a minute. I'm ready.

28:20.680 --> 28:21.720
OK?

28:21.720 --> 28:25.720
Nothing
up my sleeves.

28:31.320 --> 28:35.320
I've got to get
a new hat.

28:48.120 --> 28:49.560
You're on time.

28:49.560 --> 28:50.960
For crying out loud.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.440
Who's Kardiak
the Magnificent?

28:52.440 --> 28:55.480
You, who else?

28:55.480 --> 28:56.560
Boo!

28:56.560 --> 28:58.760
For the love
of Mike, Helen.

28:58.760 --> 29:02.200
Can't you see I'm
about to make an entrance?

29:02.200 --> 29:05.120
Sorry, but the police are here.
They have found John Doe.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.560
I'll be right back.

29:06.560 --> 29:09.200
At last, the long
arm of the law.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.720
There you are, Doe.

29:10.720 --> 29:14.360
Where's my novel?

29:14.360 --> 29:15.800
That isn't John Doe, damn it.

29:15.800 --> 29:18.680
It's a sad day in Boston
when an upstanding citizen

29:18.680 --> 29:22.680
gets short shrift
from the boys in blue.

29:28.440 --> 29:29.920
It's show time!

29:29.920 --> 29:31.480
(CHEERING)

29:31.480 --> 29:35.480
The show's over.

29:48.880 --> 29:52.760
So, where have you been
for the last two hours?

29:52.760 --> 29:55.680
Studying.

29:55.680 --> 29:58.720
I've been
with your friend
from the elevator.

29:58.720 --> 30:01.240
You can visit him
any time you're ready.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.280
Really?

30:02.280 --> 30:04.560
Sure. In the morgue.

30:04.560 --> 30:08.560
Thanks for leaving me
holding the ambu-bag.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.640
Come on, cut it out.

30:10.640 --> 30:12.720
(SOBS) I didn't know
what to do.

30:12.720 --> 30:16.720
I was no help at all.

30:17.200 --> 30:18.800
Owen...

30:18.800 --> 30:22.640
the guy was probably
dead before he hit
the floor.

30:22.640 --> 30:24.000
I didn't help him.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.720
So what?

30:25.720 --> 30:29.720
But his body went cold.

30:39.600 --> 30:42.640
You know, Owen, when I was
10 years old,

30:42.640 --> 30:45.040
my best friend's
father died.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.960
It was an open casket.

30:46.960 --> 30:50.400
I had never seen
a dead person before.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.000
Mr Bouchet
lying there,

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
kind of yellow
and puffy.

30:56.560 --> 31:00.080
I went towards him,
and I closed my eyes,

31:00.080 --> 31:01.520
walking on autopilot.

31:01.520 --> 31:02.960
I probably knelt there

31:02.960 --> 31:04.880
no longer
than 10 seconds.

31:04.880 --> 31:07.280
But I'll never
forget that smell -

31:07.280 --> 31:10.560
formaldehyde
and bay rum.

31:10.560 --> 31:14.560
I went home and barfed.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.680
But you're
used to death now.

31:17.680 --> 31:21.680
No! It still scares me.

31:21.760 --> 31:23.040
That does it.

31:23.040 --> 31:25.760
I'm leaving St Eligius.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.200
What are you talking about?

31:27.200 --> 31:28.640
You're supposed to feel better.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.560
I just spilled my guts to you.

31:30.560 --> 31:32.640
Hands-on's not
where I belong.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.960
My innermost
thoughts and fears.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.360
I'm going back
to the university.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.760
I'm going to get my PhD
in genetic research.

31:39.760 --> 31:42.680
My very soul. I bared my psyche
for the entire world to see.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.240
Shut up, Elliot.

31:44.240 --> 31:45.360
OK.

31:45.360 --> 31:47.680
The gift of my intelligence
is also my curse.

31:47.680 --> 31:50.600
If you ask me, you should go build
a tree house somewhere.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.240
Take some time off.
Act like a normal kid.

31:52.240 --> 31:54.240
I'm not normal.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.360
Yes, you are!

31:55.360 --> 31:56.800
My IQ is 162.

31:56.800 --> 32:00.320
OK, so you're not.

32:00.320 --> 32:04.320
I guess I better
talk to Dr Kim.

32:05.160 --> 32:06.320
Hey, Elliot.

32:06.320 --> 32:09.680
We're going across to the park
for two-hand touch,

32:09.680 --> 32:11.560
a little pass, punt, kick.
Roll around the leaves.

32:11.560 --> 32:12.760
Want to come?

32:12.760 --> 32:13.960
Sure.

32:13.960 --> 32:17.560
Good.

32:17.560 --> 32:20.040
Hey, Owen, you want to join us?

32:20.040 --> 32:21.680
I'm not that good at sports.

32:21.680 --> 32:23.240
That's OK.
I'll teach you.

32:23.240 --> 32:27.240
I'm not that bad.

32:29.120 --> 32:30.560
Boy, am I steamed.

32:30.560 --> 32:32.000
So am I.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.320
No. I just got
a goodbye hug
from Helen Rosenthal.

32:35.320 --> 32:38.720
That woman's worked here...how long?
20-odd years? What the hell's
going on in this place?

32:38.720 --> 32:40.840
Mandatory testing
means exactly
what it implies.

32:40.840 --> 32:43.640
Yeah. Well, I knew
it was a bad idea.

32:43.640 --> 32:46.560
Helen's being stubborn
for the sake of ego.

32:46.560 --> 32:47.840
Same as when she still
worked in the nurses' strike.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.440
No. No, you're wrong.

32:49.440 --> 32:51.840
What Helen is doing
is responding

32:51.840 --> 32:55.200
to a basic flaw
in the whole concept.

32:55.200 --> 32:59.200
Look, what you have now, Daniel,
is a whole undercurrent
of suspicion, innuendo.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.840
Of course drugs are a major problem
in the world, we all know it,

33:02.840 --> 33:06.240
but playing big brother
won't give us an answer.

33:06.240 --> 33:08.600
All you are doing is encouraging
people who are addicted
to find a place to hide.

33:08.600 --> 33:12.600
I'm baffled by your
simplistic view
of human nature.

33:12.680 --> 33:16.680
This hospital was built
on that foundation,
wasn't it?

33:17.640 --> 33:19.000
You're in a fog.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.120
What's that supposed to mean?

33:20.120 --> 33:23.120
I can't see you
without my glasses.

33:23.120 --> 33:24.760
I'll come closer.

33:24.760 --> 33:26.680
Your points were
well taken,

33:26.680 --> 33:29.080
but I'm afraid we're
too far along now.

33:29.080 --> 33:31.160
Drug screening
will continue.

33:31.160 --> 33:32.640
Well, that's fine.

33:32.640 --> 33:35.040
Then you can just consider me
suspended, Daniel.

33:35.040 --> 33:39.040
There's no way in this world
I'm going to take that test.

33:45.920 --> 33:47.280
And I feel terrible,

33:47.280 --> 33:50.080
because obviously she didn't know
anything about what had
happened to Jack.

33:50.080 --> 33:52.960
Sometimes you have to
learn the hard way.

33:52.960 --> 33:55.760
Now this is my idea
of breakfast,

33:55.760 --> 33:59.160

in that Danish.

Dr Craig?

34:05.080 --> 34:06.400
I just wasn't good enough.

not magician.

to shut up.

asked him yet?

34:13.520 --> 34:15.159
Ask me? Ask me what?

34:15.159 --> 34:18.040
To help get my husband
out of Russia.

34:18.040 --> 34:20.920
What do I look like,
a freedom fighter?

34:20.920 --> 34:23.280
You are
important man.

34:23.280 --> 34:27.280
Read my lips,
sister. Nyet!

34:30.320 --> 34:34.320
Ohh...

34:39.159 --> 34:43.159
Miss Kayshen's trouble
appears to be simply a side effect
of her antiarrhythmic therapy.

34:44.360 --> 34:46.679
Quinidine certainly can cause
upper GI distress.

You wanted
to see me?

34:52.360 --> 34:55.360
Yes. I've put a halt
to the drug testing

34:55.360 --> 34:56.760
until we can formulate
a new policy.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.600
This means
I'm not suspended?

34:58.600 --> 34:59.720
Think so.

34:59.720 --> 35:01.120
Oh, thank goodness.

35:01.120 --> 35:03.440
Luther, here comes
the best part of the job.

35:03.440 --> 35:07.160
Go tell Miss Kayshen
the good news.

35:07.160 --> 35:09.920
I find it tough
to admit I'm wrong.

35:09.920 --> 35:12.120

you're a big man.

35:12.120 --> 35:13.640
Especially
when I'm right.

35:13.640 --> 35:16.720
Helen, you embarrassed me before
my peers, the board,

35:16.720 --> 35:18.520
and I won't
forget it.

35:18.520 --> 35:20.400
Now if you'll
excuse me,

35:20.400 --> 35:24.400
I have some
work to do.

35:29.960 --> 35:31.400
She had to tell him when...

35:31.400 --> 35:33.320
Morning, Jack.
Do you mind?

35:33.320 --> 35:36.840
Oh, no.

by the lab.

35:41.480 --> 35:42.400
Fine.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.520
Fine.

35:43.520 --> 35:45.160
She's OK.

complaints about your work.

complaining that you're neglecting
them,

35:51.880 --> 35:54.120
you're not paying
attention to details,

35:54.120 --> 35:55.520

them roughly.

That's not like you.

I admit,
I've been a little unfocused.

are concerned too,

36:00.640 --> 36:02.240
saying you're
short-tempered, moody.

to you in prison

and I poured you
on that airplane back to Seattle...

The idea of putting in
a new sprinkler system

37:00.120 --> 37:03.480
was to water the azaleas,
not wash the windows.
