WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:01.602
AND THE SAME THING GOES
FOR QUARTERLY REPORTS.

00:01.635 --> 00:02.570
THEY ARE UNREADABLE.

00:02.603 --> 00:04.772
THEY'RE JUST NUMBERS
AND BORING AND BLECH.

00:04.805 --> 00:07.308
SO WHAT I WAS THINKING
IS THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE

00:07.341 --> 00:09.477
SOME SORT OF GRAPHIC.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.745
LIKE IF WE HAVE A BAD QUARTER,
PUT IN A STORM CLOUD.

00:13.314 --> 00:16.784
AND WHEN WE HAVE
A GOOD QUARTER...

00:16.817 --> 00:18.252
FIREWORKS.

00:18.286 --> 00:21.789
OR A RACE CAR.

00:21.822 --> 00:23.557
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
A RACE CAR.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.226
USE YOUR IMAGINATION.

00:25.259 --> 00:27.261
(Jim)
THERE'S THIS CUBE ON THE SCREEN,

00:27.295 --> 00:28.462
AND IT BOUNCES AROUND
ALL DAY.

00:28.496 --> 00:29.663
AND SOMETIMES IT LOOKS
LIKE IT'S HEADING

00:29.697 --> 00:31.699
RIGHT INTO THE CORNER
OF THE SCREEN.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.101
AND AT THE LAST MINUTE
IT HITS THE WALL

00:33.134 --> 00:35.169
AND BOUNCES AWAY.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.105
WE ARE ALL JUST DYING
TO SEE IT GO

00:37.138 --> 00:40.241
RIGHT INTO THE CORNER.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.410
PAM CLAIMS THAT SHE SAW IT
ONE DAY

00:42.443 --> 00:44.645
WHEN SHE WAS ALONE
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

00:44.678 --> 00:45.846
OKAY...

00:45.879 --> 00:48.082
I BELIEVE SHE THINKS
SHE SAW IT.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.150
I SAW IT.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.518
I SAW IT,
AND IT WAS AMAZING.

00:50.551 --> 00:51.619
WHO SAID
I DIDN'T SEE IT?

00:51.652 --> 00:53.354
DID JIM SAY
THAT I DIDN'T SEE IT?

00:53.387 --> 00:54.522
I SAW IT!

00:54.555 --> 00:57.325
WE HAVE A LOT
OF COLORED PAPER HERE.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.827
WHY, OH, WHY, DO WE KEEP
PRINTING THIS ON WHITE?

00:59.860 --> 01:01.662
NO! COME ON!

01:01.695 --> 01:03.831
YEAH. I KNOW.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.599
I KNOW.
IT'S BLAND.

01:05.633 --> 01:06.767
(Oscar)
IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.237
DUDE, YOU'VE
GOTTA BELIEVE.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.639
MAYBE WE COULD HAVE
SOME SORT OF RIDDLE...

01:11.672 --> 01:13.807
(Jim)
WAIT FOR IT.

01:13.841 --> 01:16.644
LIKE SOMETHING
THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR...

01:16.677 --> 01:18.646
SORT OF
A WHERE'S WALDO?

01:18.679 --> 01:19.713
OH!

01:19.747 --> 01:22.250
[laughter, cheers]

01:22.283 --> 01:23.884
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.653
LET'S QUIT
WHILE WE'RE AHEAD.

01:25.686 --> 01:26.820
(Kevin)
THAT WAS SO AWESOME.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.423
THAT WAS AWESOME.
THANK YOU.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.658
[laughing]

01:30.691 --> 01:33.194
SOME DAYS,
I AM JUST ON FIRE.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.729
[talking through teeth]
WHAT CAN I SAY?

02:09.630 --> 02:10.631
HEY, THERE HE IS.

02:10.664 --> 02:11.632
HEY, MEREDITH.
HOW YOU FEELING?

02:11.665 --> 02:13.767
I NEVER THANKED YOU
FOR COMING TO THE HOSPITAL.

02:13.801 --> 02:14.802
OH, PLEASE.
IT WAS MY PLEASURE.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.337
WELL, WE ALL CAME.
SO...

02:16.370 --> 02:18.339
WELL, I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU COMING.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.741
[singsong]
I'M SINGLING YOU OUT.

02:20.774 --> 02:21.942
UH-HUH...

02:21.975 --> 02:23.811
ANYWAY,
I HAVE THIS SHARPIE.

02:23.844 --> 02:24.778
UH-HUH.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.581
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU COULD SIGN MY CAST.

02:27.615 --> 02:28.649
MM-HMM.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.655
CAN YOU WRITE
WHERE I CAN READ IT?

02:34.688 --> 02:35.823
OH--YEP.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.964
[whispering]
I'LL READ THIS
WHEN I GET HOME.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.499
ALL RIGHT.

02:48.436 --> 02:49.803
(Pam)
MICHAEL, THIS IS
THE PRESS RELEASE

02:49.837 --> 02:51.272
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.274
RYAN WANTS YOU
TO SHARE IT WITH EVERYONE.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.475
OH, DOES HE?

02:54.508 --> 02:55.476
HE DOES.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.510
MM.

02:56.544 --> 02:57.745
OKAY.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.580
ATTENTION, EARTHLINGS.

02:59.613 --> 03:00.714
I HAVE SOME NEWS.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.350
BEEP-BEEP-BEEP
BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP

03:02.383 --> 03:04.218
BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP
BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.653
OKAY.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.655
TODAY'S THE BIG DAY
THAT I'M HEADING TO NEW YORK

03:07.688 --> 03:11.492
TO ATTEND A PARTY WITH SUSHI
AND IMPORTANT PEOPLE.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.561
ON AN UNRELATED NOTE,
IF ANYBODY HAS

03:13.594 --> 03:15.629
AN INTERESTING ANECDOTE
THAT IS NOT BORING

03:15.663 --> 03:16.497
AND EASY TO MEMORIZE,

03:16.530 --> 03:18.699
PLEASE DROP BY MY OFFICE
BEFORE I LEAVE.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.501
THANK YOU.
(Jim)
WHOOPS.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.636
WAS THAT REALLY WHAT RYAN
WANTED YOU TO TELL US?

03:22.670 --> 03:27.007
AND..."TODAY THE DUNDER MIFFLIN
INFINITY WEBSITE

03:27.040 --> 03:28.676
OFFICIALLY LAUNCHES."

03:28.709 --> 03:30.311
WELL, THE WEBSITE
IS THE BRAINCHILD

03:30.344 --> 03:32.012
OF MY BRAINCHILD, RYAN.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.582
IT IS MY BRAIN GRANDCHILD.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.650
AND, UH, TO CELEBRATE
ITS BIRTH,

03:36.684 --> 03:38.018
ALL OF THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES

03:38.051 --> 03:39.853
ARE GOING TO HAVE
SATELLITE PARTIES

03:39.887 --> 03:43.257
WHICH WILL BE CONNECTED
VIA WEB CAMS AND FIBERS

03:43.291 --> 03:46.360
TO THE REAL PARTY, WHICH IS
GOING ON IN NEW YORK CITY

03:46.394 --> 03:49.663
AT A VERY EXCLUSIVE NIGHTCLUB.

03:49.697 --> 03:52.533
AND THAT IS WHERE
ALL OF THE VIPs,

03:52.566 --> 03:54.468
INCLUDING YOURS TRULY,

03:54.502 --> 03:57.805
WILL BE PARTYING
WITH NEW YORK CITY'S FINEST.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.741
AND I DO NOT MEAN
POLICEMEN.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.910
"THE COMPANY IS PROJECTING
RECORD HIGH SALES

04:02.943 --> 04:04.712
"AND THAT BY 6:00,
THE WEBSITE WILL BE

04:04.745 --> 04:06.880
THE NEW BEST SALESMAN
IN THE COMPANY."

04:06.914 --> 04:08.482
WOW. WATCH OUT, DWIGHT.

04:08.516 --> 04:09.650
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.485
I'M NOT GONNA BE BEATEN
BY A WEBSITE.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.786
ACTUALLY, IT SOUNDS
LIKE YOU ARE.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.755
REALLY? 'CAUSE RYAN
SAYS SO?

04:14.788 --> 04:15.689
THAT'S FROM RYAN?

04:15.723 --> 04:17.491
DOES IT MENTION
IF HE'S SEEING ANYBODY?

04:17.525 --> 04:18.759
NO, IT DOESN'T.
I'LL FIND OUT TONIGHT.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.461
YES, PLEASE LET US KNOW.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.630
I CAN MAKE MORE SALES
THAN A COMPUTER.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.432
IN FACT,
I CHALLENGE THAT WEBSITE

04:24.465 --> 04:25.933
TO MAKE MORE SALES
THAN ME TODAY.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.635
WASTE OF TIME.

04:27.668 --> 04:28.636
WHAT'S THAT, PIPSQUEAK?

04:28.669 --> 04:30.404
WASTE OF TIME.

04:30.438 --> 04:31.805
THE WEBSITE'S
GOING TO WIN.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.006
YOU BELIEVE
A COMPUTER CAN BEAT ME?

04:33.040 --> 04:34.575
I DON'T CARE,
BUT YES.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.976
WELL, I WILL
PROVE YOU WRONG.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.411
I DON'T CARE,
AND YOU WON'T.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.679
YOU'LL SEE.

04:38.712 --> 04:39.747
I WON'T BE WATCHING,
AND I WON'T.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.552
DWIGHT MERCY KILLED
ANGELA'S CAT.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.787
IT'S VERY COMPLICATED.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.589
IT'S CAUSED
A LOT OF UNPLEASANTNESS

04:48.622 --> 04:50.724
BETWEEN DWIGHT AND ANGELA.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.761
WHO WERE BOTH ALREADY
PRONE TO UNPLEASANTNESS.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.732
[jazzy/bluesy music]

04:58.766 --> 05:00.868
*

05:00.901 --> 05:01.869
STANLEY,
YOU'RE DANCING.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.704
NO, I'M NOT.
[stops music]

05:05.839 --> 05:07.808
YEAH, I CREATED
A WEBSITE.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.110
LOOK, AT THE END
OF THE DAY,

05:10.143 --> 05:12.713
APPLE'S APPLE IS FLYING
AT 30,000 FEET.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.615
THIS IS A PAPER COMPANY.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.417
AND I DON'T WANT US
TO GET LOST IN THE WEEDS

05:16.450 --> 05:17.685
OR TO A BEAUTY CONTEST.

05:17.718 --> 05:18.619
(man)
HEY! I TOLD YOU

05:18.652 --> 05:20.721
I DON'T WANT YOU DOING
THESE THINGS IN HERE.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.056
YOU CAN USE YOUR OWN OFFICE
OR DO IT DOWN THE HALL.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.426
CONVERGENCE, VIRAL MARKETING.
WE'RE GOING GUERILLA.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.794
WE'RE TAKING IT TO THE STREETS

05:26.827 --> 05:28.796
WHILE KEEPING AN EYE
ON THE STREET--WALL STREET.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.798
I DON'T WANT TO REINVENT
THE WHEEL HERE.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.033
IN OTHER WORDS,
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.869
BUYING PAPER
JUST BECAME FUN.

05:37.838 --> 05:41.509
AND THIS IS WHERE
I WILL RECORD YOUR SALES.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.411
HMM. VERY NICE.
VERY NICE.

05:43.444 --> 05:46.680
AND THEN I WILL
SAY SOMETHING POSITIVE

05:46.714 --> 05:48.816
LIKE "KUDOS"
OR "JOB WELL DONE."

05:48.849 --> 05:51.018
OR ZIP-A-DEE-DOO-DAH.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.656
I CAN'T TELL
IF HE'S MOCKING ME.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.458
JUST IGNORE HIM.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.559
CAN'T DO THAT.

05:58.592 --> 06:01.429
[laughs]
IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME
TO LET THINGS GO.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.696
I WAS. MOCKING.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.498
THANK YOU.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.068
I JUST FEEL LIKE WE NEED
SOMETHING MORE TO ACKNOWLEDGE

06:08.101 --> 06:09.403
WHEN I MAKE A SALE.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.038
YES, LIKE A CHIME
OR A BELL.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.707
OR A GONG.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.048
GO TO MY CAR.
OPEN THE TRUNK.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.751
INSIDE, YOU WILL SEE
MANY PELTS.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.086
UNDER THE SMALLEST ONE
IS A CASE.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.756
INSIDE THAT CASE
IS A BEAR HORN.

06:28.789 --> 06:29.957
BRING IT TO ME.

06:29.990 --> 06:30.991
YES!

06:37.230 --> 06:40.568
ISN'T 7:00 P.M.
A LITTLE LATE FOR A LUNCH PARTY?

06:41.769 --> 06:42.536
LUNCH PARTY?

06:42.570 --> 06:45.005
IT'S SUPPOSED TO SAY
LAUNCH PARTY.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.741
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU?

06:47.775 --> 06:50.678
ANGELA IS WORSE
THAN USUAL LATELY,

06:50.711 --> 06:52.446
AND WE HAVE A PARTY
TO THROW.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.949
SO I GOOGLED "HOW TO DEAL
WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE,"

06:55.983 --> 06:59.019
AND I GOT ALL OF THIS.

06:59.052 --> 07:02.490
[whispering]
SO WE'RE GONNA TRY OUT
SOME NEW THINGS TODAY.

07:02.523 --> 07:05.826
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE FACT
THAT THE BANNER SAYS "LUNCH"?

07:05.859 --> 07:08.496
I FEEL ANGRY.
ANGRY AT YOU.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.731
ANGRY AT YOU FOR DOING
SOMETHING STUPID.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.032
ANGRY AT ME FOR BELIEVING

07:12.065 --> 07:14.034
YOU COULD DO SOMETHING
NOT STUPID.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.839
I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
THAT MUST BE AWFUL.

07:18.872 --> 07:22.242
IT IS AWFUL.
YOU'VE MADE THIS DAY AWFUL.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.479
MAYBE YOU COULD JUST
CHANGE THE "U" INTO AN "A."

07:25.513 --> 07:27.815
THEN IT WOULD SAY
LANCH PARTY, KEVIN.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.983
WOULD IT REALLY BE BETTER
IF IT SAID LANCH PARTY?

07:30.017 --> 07:31.018
(Michael)
OH, LUNCH PARTY.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.786
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO SAY LAUNCH.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.488
OKAY, WOW!
EASY, BOOSTER SEAT.

07:34.522 --> 07:35.989
NOBODY CARES ABOUT
THIS PARTY ANYWAY.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.625
I CARE!

07:37.658 --> 07:38.692
PLAN A PARTY, ANGELA.

07:38.726 --> 07:40.027
OH, AND THE ENTIRE
WORLD WILL SEE IT.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.195
OH! AND HERE'S $65
FOR YOUR BUDGET.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.831
OH, AND HERE ARE FOUR IDIOTS

07:43.864 --> 07:45.499
WHO'LL DO NOTHING
BUT WEIGH YOU DOWN.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.668
OH, AND YOUR CAT'S
STILL DEAD.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.002
20 SECONDS TO GO TIME.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.705
GOT IT.
CARB UP.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.541
REALLY? POWER GEL?

07:53.574 --> 07:57.578
HEY, YOU WANNA WIN,
YOU GOTTA FUEL LIKE A WINNER.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.913
(Andy)
OKAY. WE START...

07:59.947 --> 08:02.883
AS SOON AS I MAKE
THIS SHOT.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.084
HAH--GO!

08:04.117 --> 08:05.586
YAH!

08:08.756 --> 08:10.758
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
IF I TOLD YOU

08:10.791 --> 08:12.292
WE COULD PULL A PRANK
ON DWIGHT

08:12.325 --> 08:14.662
AND AT THE SAME TIME
NOT BE WORKING?

08:16.063 --> 08:17.197
WHAT?

08:17.230 --> 08:18.732
HE'S GOING THROUGH
A BREAKUP.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.668
YEAH, I'M AWARE
OF THAT.

08:20.701 --> 08:21.802
BUT HE'S ALSO BEING
SUPER-ANNOYING,

08:21.835 --> 08:22.870
AND I'M NOT
A PERFECT PERSON.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.138
[bear horn beeps]
YEAH!

08:25.172 --> 08:26.807
YOU GOT ONE!
THREE REAMS!

08:26.840 --> 08:29.910
IN YOUR FACE,
MACHINES!

08:31.178 --> 08:33.280
WHAT KINDA PRANK
ARE YOU THINKING?

08:34.715 --> 08:37.618
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
I COULD OFFER FREE SHIPPING?

08:37.651 --> 08:38.686
SURE, I'LL HOLD.

08:38.719 --> 08:39.953
[IM tone]

08:56.670 --> 08:57.771
NOT SURE.

08:57.805 --> 08:58.872
[Pam typing]

08:58.906 --> 09:00.874
JUST BECAME SELF-AWARE.

09:00.908 --> 09:03.210
SO MUCH TO FIGURE OUT.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.813
I THINK I'M PROGRAMMED
TO BE YOUR ENEMY.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.749
I THINK IT IS MY JOB
TO DESTROY YOU

09:08.782 --> 09:10.918
WHEN IT COMES
TO SELLING PAPER.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.136
[IM tone]

09:32.372 --> 09:35.809
(Dwight)
IT APPEARS THAT THE WEBSITE
HAS BECOME ALIVE.

09:35.843 --> 09:38.345
THIS HAPPENS TO COMPUTERS
AND ROBOTS SOMETIMES.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.213
AM I SCARED
OF A STUPID COMPUTER?

09:40.247 --> 09:42.616
PLEASE! THE COMPUTER
SHOULD BE SCARED OF ME.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.785
I HAVE BEEN SALESMAN
OF THE MONTH

09:44.818 --> 09:46.820
FOR 13 OUT OF THE LAST
12 MONTHS.

09:46.854 --> 09:48.656
YOU HEARD ME RIGHT.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.990
I DID SO WELL LAST FEBRUARY

09:50.023 --> 09:51.892
THAT CORPORATE
GAVE ME TWO PLAQUES

09:51.925 --> 09:54.061
IN LIEU OF A PAY RAISE.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.035
OKAY.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.771
YES, IT'S TOO TIGHT.

10:03.804 --> 10:04.705
WAY TOO TIGHT.

10:04.738 --> 10:05.973
REALLY?

10:06.006 --> 10:07.140
THIS IS WHY I'M HERE?

10:07.174 --> 10:08.676
WHY IS IT SO TIGHT?

10:08.709 --> 10:10.010
IT'S A EUROPEAN CUT.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.912
IT JUST LOOKS BAD.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.247
UM...HEY.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.050
UH, WHAT'S HANGING?

10:17.084 --> 10:19.052
SETTING UP THE WEB CAM
FOR THE PARTY.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.088
OH, GOOD.
OKAY, COOL.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.894
HOW MANY POUNDS DO YOU
THINK I COULD LOSE BY 7:00?

10:26.927 --> 10:29.296
DEPENDS HOW MUCH
YOU'VE EATEN ALREADY TODAY.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.699
I HAD ONE OF THOSE...
[ringing]

10:31.732 --> 10:33.300
DUNDER MIFFLIN.
THIS IS PAM.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.401
[whispering]
TOO MANY CARBS.

10:34.434 --> 10:36.136
JUST ONE SECOND.
WE'RE IN A MEETING.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.437
I'LL SEE
IF HE'S AVAILABLE.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.339
IT'S JAN.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.943
WHY DON'T YOU WANNA
GO TONIGHT?

10:42.976 --> 10:45.212
WHAT--ALL YOUR FRIENDS
ARE GONNA BE THERE.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.314
(Jan)
MY FRIENDS? MICHAEL,
I WAS TERMINATED.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.116
JUST--[sighs].

10:49.149 --> 10:50.984
IS IT REALLY
THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU?
YEAH!

10:51.018 --> 10:52.152
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.754
GO BY YOURSELF.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.455
NO--[scoffs].
NO.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.790
NO. IF I GO BY MYSELF,

10:56.824 --> 10:58.792
EVERYBODY'LL THINK
I'M A BIG LOSER.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.460
WELL...

11:00.493 --> 11:02.796
DO I HAVE YOUR PERMISSION
TO INVITE CAROL?

11:02.830 --> 11:03.864
JESUS, MICHAEL!

11:03.897 --> 11:05.165
I'M SOR--I'M SORRY.

11:05.198 --> 11:08.435
IT'S JUST THE FIRST...GIRL
THAT POPPED INTO MY HEAD.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.704
I'LL FIND SOMEBODY
THAT I HAVEN'T SLEPT WITH.

11:10.738 --> 11:11.772
[horn beeps]

11:11.805 --> 11:13.306
OH!
NICE!

11:13.340 --> 11:15.175
WEBSITE CHECK,
PLEASE.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.210
305.

11:17.244 --> 11:18.445
3-0-5.

11:18.478 --> 11:21.214
YOU, MY FRIEND,
ARE WINNING HANDSOMELY.

11:21.248 --> 11:23.817
OH, IT JUST MADE
ANOTHER SALE--380.

11:23.851 --> 11:28.421
YOU, MY FRIEND, ARE IN
A VERY CLOSE SECOND.

11:28.455 --> 11:29.757
402.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.759
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST LAY OFF, LADY?

11:31.792 --> 11:33.794
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO,
NOT ANNOUNCE IT?

11:33.827 --> 11:34.895
412.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.467
SO, THIS IS THE DEALIO.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.203
GOD HAS SMILED UPON ME

11:43.236 --> 11:44.404
AND GIVEN ME TWO TICKETS

11:44.437 --> 11:46.974
TO THE BIG PARTY
IN NEW YORK TONIGHT.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.076
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
THIS EVENING?

11:52.846 --> 11:54.047
(Michael)
LOOK AT THAT.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.216
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN
LITTLE LANGUAGE NOW,

11:56.249 --> 11:57.517
LIKE TWINS.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.786
SURE, WE'LL GO.

11:58.819 --> 11:59.787
ALL RIGHT, WELL,

11:59.820 --> 12:01.188
FIGHT IT OUT
AMONGST YOURSELVES.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.389
I WAS THINKING PAMMY,

12:02.422 --> 12:03.891
BUT BOYS' NIGHT OUT
IS ALSO GOOD.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.826
OH, I'M SORRY.
WHAT?

12:06.794 --> 12:08.495
ONE OF THE TICKETS
IS FOR HIM.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.297
JUST LET ME KNOW
WHO THE WINNER IS.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.400
NOT IT.
NOT IT.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.768
NOPE.
I WON.

12:14.802 --> 12:15.803
DEFINITELY NOT.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.204
IF ANYTHING,
IT WAS A TIE.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.939
TIE GOES
TO THE GIRLFRIEND.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.442
NO, I REALIZE YOU NORMALLY
REORDER IN NOVEMBER,

12:22.475 --> 12:24.311
BUT WHAT I'M SUGGESTING--

12:24.344 --> 12:25.779
YOU DID WHAT?

12:25.813 --> 12:27.347
OH! NO!

12:27.380 --> 12:29.983
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE
NOT SUPPOSED TO DO, DAMN IT!

12:30.017 --> 12:31.451
WHY WOULD YOU REORDER
FROM A COMPUTER

12:31.484 --> 12:34.154
WHEN YOU COULD HAVE THE PERSONAL
TOUCH OF A SALESMAN?

12:34.187 --> 12:35.555
[groans]
OH!

12:35.588 --> 12:36.523
HOW'S IT GOING?

12:36.556 --> 12:37.858
FINE. GOOD.

12:37.891 --> 12:38.892
YEAH?
YEAH.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.193
YOU LOOK
A LITTLE WORRIED.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.362
I DO NOT LOOK
WORRIED.

12:44.231 --> 12:45.498
[IM tone]

12:56.543 --> 12:58.078
"HERE'S A SUGGESTION,
COMPUTER.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.813
"I ASSUME
YOU READ BINARY.

12:59.847 --> 13:05.085
SO WHY DON'T YOU
011-1111-011-011?"

13:05.118 --> 13:06.386
OKAY.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.221
UM, WHILE YOU WERE
TYPING THAT,

13:08.255 --> 13:10.557
I SEARCHED EVERY
DATABASE IN EXISTENCE

13:10.590 --> 13:13.226
AND LEARNED EVERY FACT
ABOUT EVERYTHING...

13:13.260 --> 13:14.962
AND MASTERED THE VIOLIN.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.599
OH, AND SOLD MORE PAPER.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.467
[typing]

13:20.500 --> 13:22.102
[IM tone]

13:30.010 --> 13:32.112
I ASKED FOR
ASSORTED CUTLERY,

13:32.145 --> 13:33.513
AND I GOT BACK SPOONS.

13:33.546 --> 13:34.982
THESE ARE WORTHLESS.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.616
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

13:36.649 --> 13:40.553
BUT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME
WHEN YOU USE THAT TONE.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.390
PHYLLIS,

13:43.423 --> 13:46.059
THESE ARE SPOONS.

13:46.093 --> 13:48.528
SPOONS
HAVE ROUNDED TOPS

13:48.561 --> 13:51.098
AND ARE USED
TO SCOOP THINGS.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.600
WHAT WE NEED
ARE FORKS

13:53.633 --> 13:57.905
WHICH HAVE PRONGS
OR TINY SPEARS ON TOP.

13:57.938 --> 14:01.441
AND WE NEED KNIVES
WHICH HAVE BLADES.

14:01.474 --> 14:04.577
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME
NOW?

14:04.611 --> 14:05.578
YES.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.214
GOODY.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.553
HEY, MAN.
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

14:13.586 --> 14:14.554
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:14.587 --> 14:15.923
I HAVE A DELIVERY.
OH, YEAH?

14:15.956 --> 14:18.125
KELLY ORDERED THIS
ONLINE.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.103
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

14:30.137 --> 14:31.638
I AM IN THE FIGHT OF MY LIFE
AGAINST THIS COMPUTER,

14:31.671 --> 14:32.805
AND EVERY SALE COUNTS.

14:32.839 --> 14:35.342
BUT YOU GET TO PUT THE PAPER
IN THIS LITTLE SHOPPING CART,

14:35.375 --> 14:37.510
AND THEN IT SAYS "THANKS FOR
SHOPPING WITH DUNDER MIFFLIN."

14:37.544 --> 14:40.981
DAMN IT, KELLY,
IT KNOWS!

14:41.014 --> 14:43.116
IT KNOWS WHAT YOU DID!
WHO KNOWS?

14:43.150 --> 14:44.651
RETURN IT.
RETURN IT NOW.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.653
HEY...

14:46.686 --> 14:49.589
HOW ABOUT INSTEAD OF YELLING
AT OUR SWEET LITTLE MISS KAPOOR

14:49.622 --> 14:50.657
OVER 500 SHEETS OF PAPER,

14:50.690 --> 14:51.691
YOU GET BACK TO YOUR DESK

14:51.724 --> 14:55.328
AND START SELLING
MULTIPLE REAMS, LIKE A MAN.

14:55.362 --> 14:57.597
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.366
OKAY, IF THIS MAKES
THE DIFFERENCE,

14:59.399 --> 15:02.602
I'M GONNA TELL IT
THAT YOU WERE RESPONSIBLE.

15:02.635 --> 15:05.338
WHO'S "IT"?

15:09.542 --> 15:10.944
HERE YOU GO.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.445
THANKS.

15:12.479 --> 15:13.480
SO YOU STILL
MISSING RYAN?

15:13.513 --> 15:16.283
NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.051
MM.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.589
(Dwight)
I AM NOT A BAD PERSON.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.391
WHEN I LEFT STAPLES,

15:24.424 --> 15:25.558
I TOOK SOME OF THEIR LEADS
WITH ME,

15:25.592 --> 15:27.694
BUT I NEVER INTENDED
TO USE THEM.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.629
WHAT DID I INTEND
TO DO WITH THEM?

15:29.662 --> 15:31.031
WHO KNOWS?

15:31.064 --> 15:33.000
MAYBE KEEP THEM
AS A SOUVENIR.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.168
MAYBE USE THEM.

15:35.202 --> 15:36.169
YES, MR. GALLIATTO,

15:36.203 --> 15:38.571
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO PAY
10% LESS FOR PAPER

15:38.605 --> 15:40.673
THAN YOU'RE PAYING
RIGHT NOW?

15:40.707 --> 15:42.742
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT
HOW I GOT YOUR INFORMATION.

15:42.775 --> 15:46.046
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT
YOU SAY YES.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.380
GOOD.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.616
ALL RIGHT, I'M READY TO GO,
AND I'M CALLING SHOTGUN.

15:49.649 --> 15:50.617
I'M DRIVING?

15:50.650 --> 15:51.584
YES, THANK YOU.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.254
ALL RIGHT, LET ME JUST
SAY GOOD-BYE TO PAM.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.255
OH, YEAH, YOU BETTER.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.723
YOU BETTER SAY GOOD-BYE
TO PAM.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.491
SAY GOOD-BYE TO PAM.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.527
[high-pitched voice]
GOOD-BYE.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.030
I LOVE YOU.

16:03.063 --> 16:05.665
OOH, OOH, OOH,
UH-HUH.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.534
[whispering]
I LOVE YOU--OKAY.

16:07.567 --> 16:10.437
* I'M LEAVING INSIDE JIM'S CAR

16:10.470 --> 16:12.405
* I DON'T KNOW WHEN
I'LL BE BACK AGAIN *

16:12.439 --> 16:14.341
* YES, I DO

16:14.374 --> 16:17.477
* TOMORROW I'LL BE BACK

16:17.510 --> 16:19.046
* I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW

16:19.079 --> 16:20.513
YEAH, SO YOU KNOW WHAT,

16:20.547 --> 16:23.150
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS TAKE OFF
A LITTLE BIT EARLY TONIGHT?

16:23.183 --> 16:24.684
BECAUSE THERE'S A PARTY.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.619
A PARTY FOR THE WEB SITE
I'VE BEEN PLANNING

16:26.653 --> 16:28.155
FOR TWO WEEKS.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.656
IF YOU ARE NOT THIS TALL,

16:29.689 --> 16:32.559
YOU MAY NOT RIDE
THE ROLLER COASTER.

16:32.592 --> 16:33.560
SEE YOU GUYS TOMORROW.

16:33.593 --> 16:34.627
PERFECT.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.696
SO LET ME JUST GET
SOME BASIC INFORMATION FROM YOU.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.698
MM-HMM.
[message alert chimes]

16:45.638 --> 16:47.440
I'M SORRY, SO SORRY.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.176
YES, COULD YOU
REPEAT THAT?

16:52.845 --> 16:53.680
YES!

16:53.713 --> 16:55.515
TEN REAMS FOR
THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT!

16:55.548 --> 16:57.750
[air horn blares]

16:57.784 --> 16:58.785
DID I HAPPEN TO MENTION
THE 40 REAMS

16:58.818 --> 17:00.087
FOR THE BATTERED WOMEN'S
SHELTER?

17:00.120 --> 17:01.688
NO.
HUH?

17:01.721 --> 17:04.357
[air horn blaring]

17:06.226 --> 17:07.527
STOP IT!
GIVE ME THAT!

17:07.560 --> 17:08.761
GIVE IT!

17:08.795 --> 17:10.297
DID YOU SEE THE BOARD?

17:10.330 --> 17:11.564
THERE'S STILL AN HOUR.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.403
YOU EVER READ THIS?

17:16.436 --> 17:17.504
YEAH.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.306
A LONG TIME AGO,
BUT I LIKED IT.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.374
I GOT IT FOR RYAN.

17:21.408 --> 17:22.842
I WANTED TO GET HIM
OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO,

17:22.875 --> 17:24.377
BUT THEY WERE SOLD OUT.
YEAH.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.247
I FIGURED SAME SORT OF STUFF
IN HERE.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.249
IT'S NOT,
BUT IT'S A GOOD BOOK.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.318
MWAH, MWAH.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.153
WHAT WAS THAT?

17:33.186 --> 17:34.854
LEAVING PENNSYLVANIA.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.456
OH.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.824
TWO KISSES.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.460
ONE FOR ME, ONE FOR JAN.
GOTCHA.

17:40.493 --> 17:41.461
YOU GUYS SHOULD
COME OVER FOR DINNER.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.296
YOU AND PAM, THAT'D BE FUN.
THAT WOULD BE FUN.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.864
FRIDAY?
WANT TO COME OVER FRIDAY?

17:44.897 --> 17:46.133
I CAN'T.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.467
AFTER WORK, YOU GUYS--

17:47.500 --> 17:51.538
OH, NO, BECAUSE--

17:51.571 --> 17:53.340
YOU'RE GONNA LET ME KNOW
WHEN WE'RE CLOSE, RIGHT?

17:53.373 --> 17:54.141
YES.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.408
ACTUALLY, I WILL
TELL YOU RIGHT NOW.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.377
IT'S A CLUB CALLED
CHAT ROOM,

17:57.410 --> 17:59.646
AND THERE'S A PASSWORD
TO GET IN.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.315
WHICH IS ACTUALLY
"PASSWORD," SO...

18:02.349 --> 18:04.151
OKAY.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.118
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:05.152 --> 18:07.387
THAT IS AN INVITATION
TO AN ONLINE PARTY.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.855
NO.
YEAH.

18:08.888 --> 18:09.856
I'M SURE THAT'S NOT--

18:09.889 --> 18:12.892
ARE THERE THREE "Ws"

18:12.925 --> 18:15.762
AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE ADDRESS?

18:15.795 --> 18:17.830
YES.
YEP.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.370
WELL, THE INVITATION SAYS
"VIPs ONLY."

18:23.403 --> 18:26.506
IS THIS HOW YOU TREAT
YOUR VIPs, RYAN?

18:26.539 --> 18:28.808
WE'RE ALREADY
IN THE CITY.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.710
THE MAIN PART
WITH THE BUILDINGS.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.145
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

18:32.179 --> 18:33.346
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO TONIGHT?

18:33.380 --> 18:36.583
AND IF YOU TELL ME THAT I HAVE
TO DRIVE BACK TO SCRANTON

18:36.616 --> 18:38.185
TO THE SATELLITE PARTY,

18:38.218 --> 18:40.720
I AM GOING TO THROW UP.

18:40.753 --> 18:43.556
OKAY, I'M GOING TO THROW UP.
I'M THROWING UP.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.358
YOU'RE MAKING ME
THROW UP, RYAN.

18:45.392 --> 18:46.159
YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS LIKE?

18:46.193 --> 18:47.260
I WILL TELL YOU
WHAT THIS IS LIKE.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.829
THIS IS LIKE WHEN THE FRESHMEN
WOULD THROW A PARTY,

18:49.862 --> 18:52.732
AND WOULDN'T LET ANY
OF THE SENIORS GO.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.367
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS LIKE.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.469
DOESN'T IT JUST
PISS YOU OFF SOMETIMES

18:56.503 --> 18:58.371
THAT LITTLE TWERP
GOT THE PROMOTION OVER US?

18:58.405 --> 19:00.707
OH, ACTUALLY I WITHDREW
FROM CONSIDERATION.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.443
YEAH, I WITHDREW TOO.

19:11.251 --> 19:15.422
FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE!

19:15.455 --> 19:18.225
YES!
WHOO!

19:18.258 --> 19:19.359
(Dwight)
WHOO!

19:19.392 --> 19:21.828
AFTER NUMEROUS PROJECTIONS
THAT THE COMPUTER WOULD CRUSH

19:21.861 --> 19:23.530
ALL SALESMEN IN IT PATH,

19:23.563 --> 19:28.701
I AM VERY HAPPY TO REPORT
THAT OUR VERY OWN DWIGHT SCHRUTE

19:28.735 --> 19:31.438
HAS CRUSHED
HIS ELECTRONIC NEMESIS,

19:31.471 --> 19:32.572
IF YOU WILL,

19:32.605 --> 19:34.874
BY A WHOPPING 52...

19:34.907 --> 19:36.276
REAMS!
REAMS!

19:36.309 --> 19:37.444
(Dwight)
WAIT, SAY IT AGAIN--

19:37.477 --> 19:38.811
ANNOUNCE IT AGAIN.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.347
52 REAMS!
NO, NO, NO,
THE FIRST PART.

19:40.380 --> 19:44.351
DWIGHT HAS DEFEATED
THE COMPUTER.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.452
HEY.

19:45.485 --> 19:49.322
SO...
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:49.356 --> 19:51.324
[whispering]
I DID IT FOR YOU.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.792
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO DO IT FOR ME.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.494
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.930
HOW DO YOU TELL SOMEONE
IT'S OVER?

19:57.964 --> 19:59.999
YOU SEND THEM
A NOTARIZED LETTER, RIGHT?

20:00.032 --> 20:04.737
WELL, WHAT IF THE RECIPIENT
IS YOUR NOTARY?

20:04.771 --> 20:08.275
HELLO, PAM.
HELLO.

20:08.308 --> 20:11.378
HEY, DO YOU HAVE ANY MEN
THAT YOU CAN FIX ME UP WITH?

20:11.411 --> 20:14.314
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP WITH A MAN.

20:14.347 --> 20:17.617
(Pam)
UM...UH...
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.586
LET ME KNOW.

20:21.688 --> 20:25.358
[typing]

20:25.392 --> 20:27.994
[message alert chimes]

20:34.701 --> 20:36.669
ALL RIGHT,
WHO WANTS TO PARTY?

20:36.703 --> 20:37.770
WHY AREN'T YOU IN NEW YORK?

20:37.804 --> 20:39.506
OH-HO, WHAT?!

20:39.539 --> 20:40.740
OH, I THINK
I FAKED OSCAR OUT.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.475
YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T
COMING BACK

20:42.509 --> 20:43.910
AND WE COULD LEAVE EARLY.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.778
I THINK I FAKED
STANLEY OUT TOO.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.347
WHO ELSE THOUGHT
THAT I WAS LEAVING,

20:47.380 --> 20:48.648
AND THAT YOU COULD ALL
GO HOME EARLY?

20:48.681 --> 20:51.418
GOTCHA, GOTCHA, GOTCHA.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.886
WELL, WHO NEEDS NEW YORK?
RIGHT?

20:53.920 --> 20:56.323
WE CAN HAVE A KILLER PARTY
RIGHT HERE IN SCRANTON.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.457
THANK YOU.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.691
NO, NO, NO, NO.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.460
THIS IS GONNA BE NOTHING LIKE
THE PARTY YOU'VE BEEN PLANNING.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.595
THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.564
AND EVERYBODY'S
GONNA COME.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.033
WHAT'S WRONG WITH DWIGHT?

21:07.066 --> 21:08.401
HE BEAT THE COMPUTER.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.503
OH, HEY, GOOD FOR YOU.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.339
GOOD FOR YOU.
SCRANTON POWER!

21:12.372 --> 21:14.341
ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:14.374 --> 21:16.543
ANGELA, I'D LIKE YOU TO COME
INTO MY OFFICE IN TEN MINUTES.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.811
BRING SOMETHING TO WRITE WITH,
AND SOMETHING TO WRITE ON.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.713
GOOD.

21:22.449 --> 21:25.051
(Michael)
THIS WAS A PRETTY
DISAPPOINTING DAY.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.820
IT WAS KIND OF A SLAP
IN THE FACE.

21:27.854 --> 21:32.759
TO REALIZE THAT
I WASN'T AS IMPORTANT

21:32.792 --> 21:35.762
AS I THOUGHT I WAS
TO A CERTAIN YOUNG EXECUTIVE...

21:35.795 --> 21:37.430
WHO I'D CARED ABOUT.

21:37.464 --> 21:41.468
BUT YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT GONNA CRY OVER IT.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.503
I DID THAT IN THE CAR
ON THE WAY HOME.

21:43.536 --> 21:44.504
HOW WE DOING ON TIME?

21:44.537 --> 21:46.339
THE PARTY STARTS
IN AN HOUR.

21:46.373 --> 21:47.407
GOOD, THESE ARE SOME THINGS

21:47.440 --> 21:50.777
THAT I WOULD LIKE
TO HAVE HAPPEN.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.346
"BEER, LIGHT BEER,
STREAMERS, ORCHIDS,

21:53.380 --> 21:55.415
BETTER LIGHTING,
SOMETHING MADE OF ICE."

21:55.448 --> 21:57.450
THOSE ARE JUST THINGS.
THIS IS HOW I WANT IT TO FEEL.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.519
"PIZZA WITH MUSHROOMS,
PIZZA WITHOUT MUSHROOMS,

21:59.552 --> 22:01.354
WHITE PIZZA STEAK--"

22:01.388 --> 22:04.757
I WOULD LIKE THIS PARTY
TO BE SEXIER, COOLER,

22:04.791 --> 22:05.958
MORE IMPORTANT--"

22:05.992 --> 22:08.628
"CHOCOLATES,
SOMEONE FAMOUS, COOL MUSIC,

22:08.661 --> 22:11.431
CONFETTI, GO-GO DANCERS"?

22:11.464 --> 22:13.466
I WANT IT TO EMBARRASS
ALL OTHER PARTIES.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.636
I WANT IT TO BE A PARTY
THAT THE GUYS IN NEW YORK

22:16.669 --> 22:18.805
WATCH ON THE WEB CAM
AND SAY,

22:18.838 --> 22:22.074
"WOW, HOW DID THEY GET
AL ROKER TO COME?"

22:22.108 --> 22:23.876
I CAN'T DO THIS.
YES, YOU CAN.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.011
I CAN'T DO IT.
YES, YOU CAN.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.579
I KNOW YOU CAN.

22:26.613 --> 22:28.681
I WOULDN'T SAY IT
IF I DIDN'T 100% BELIEVE IT.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.450
WHO ELSE COULD DO THIS?

22:30.483 --> 22:32.885
OKAY. OKAY.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.053
NO, SERIOUSLY.

22:34.086 --> 22:34.854
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE
WHO COULD DO IT BETTER?

22:34.887 --> 22:36.456
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME.

22:38.991 --> 22:39.992
I'LL GET THE PIZZA.

22:48.935 --> 22:52.705
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF ANGELA?
JESUS.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.407
I THINK SHE'S EFFICIENT.

22:54.441 --> 22:57.777
NO, NOT LIKE THAT.
AS A WOMAN.

22:57.810 --> 23:01.047
* W-O-M-A-N

23:01.080 --> 23:02.649
I HADN'T NOTICED.

23:02.682 --> 23:06.453
YOU HADN'T NOTICED
SHE'S A WOMAN?

23:06.486 --> 23:08.755
I HEAR SHE'S SINGLE
AND READY TO MINGLE.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.190
(Andy)
I'M THINKING ABOUT
MAKING A PLAY FOR HER.

23:11.223 --> 23:14.661
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
CRAZY, RIGHT?

23:14.694 --> 23:17.830
I THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE
TO DATE SOMEONE YOU WORK WITH.

23:17.864 --> 23:19.966
ISN'T THAT PART OF THE FUN?
NO.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.034
I THINK YOU SHOULD
DATE KELLY.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.970
SHE WORKS HERE TOO.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.538
HOW IS THAT
ANY DIFFERENT?

23:25.572 --> 23:28.675
UH, SHE WORKS
IN THE ANNEX.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.677
YOU'RE ALSO WELCOME
TO DATE TOBY.

23:32.579 --> 23:35.582
OKAY.

23:35.615 --> 23:37.484
GOOD NEWS.
WE GET TO GO HOME?

23:37.517 --> 23:38.551
GUESS WHO JUST ORDERED

23:38.585 --> 23:41.654
FROM YOUR FAVORITE
PIZZA PLACE ALFREDO?

23:41.688 --> 23:43.656
WAIT...

23:43.690 --> 23:48.160
ALFREDO'S PIZZA CAFE...
OR PIZZA BY ALFREDO?

23:48.194 --> 23:49.161
SAME THING.

23:49.195 --> 23:50.797
NO.
[all disagreeing]

23:50.830 --> 23:51.898
(Michael)
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT,

23:51.931 --> 23:53.766
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHEN
YOU ALL TALK AT THE SAME TIME!

23:53.800 --> 23:56.068
(Kevin)
OSCAR, TALK TO HIM.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.704
MICHAEL, THERE'S
A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE

23:57.737 --> 23:59.138
BETWEEN THESE TWO
PIZZA PLACES.

23:59.171 --> 24:01.708
BOTH IN QUALITY
OF INGREDIENTS

24:01.741 --> 24:03.075
AND IN OVERALL TASTE.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.611
WHICH ONE DID YOU
ORDER FROM?

24:06.813 --> 24:07.847
PIZZA BY ALFREDO.

24:07.880 --> 24:08.948
[all groan]

24:08.981 --> 24:10.683
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
OKAY, OKAY.

24:10.717 --> 24:14.053
WHAT IS BETTER, A MEDIUM AMOUNT
OF GOOD PIZZA,

24:14.086 --> 24:16.689
OR ALL YOU CAN EAT
OF PRETTY GOOD PIZZA?

24:16.723 --> 24:18.591
(all)
A MEDIUM AMOUNT OF GOOD PIZZA.

24:18.625 --> 24:21.260
[sighs]

24:21.293 --> 24:22.595
OH, NO, IT'S BAD.

24:22.629 --> 24:25.865
IT'S REAL BAD.

24:25.898 --> 24:29.702
IT'S LIKE EATING
A HOT CIRCLE OF GARBAGE.

24:32.071 --> 24:34.707
YOU CAN PICK ONE
OF THESE THINGS.

24:34.741 --> 24:36.609
IT'S UNREASONABLE
FOR YOU TO ASK ME

24:36.643 --> 24:37.677
TO DO ALL OF THIS.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.846
IT SHOULD TAKE YOU
NO TIME AT ALL

24:39.879 --> 24:42.481
IF YOU PUT THE CARE INTO IT
THAT YOU NORMALLY DO.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.019
OW!

24:47.053 --> 24:49.756
THAT SEEMED TO SHUT HER UP.

24:50.923 --> 24:53.626
YOU LOOKING FOR DINNER
AND A MOVIE?

24:53.660 --> 24:55.127
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA
FIND IT IN THAT BOX.

24:57.930 --> 25:00.867
IT JUST SO HAPPENS I KNOW
WHERE YOU CAN FIND IT,

25:00.900 --> 25:05.605
BUT AGAIN...
NOT IN THE BOX.

25:07.874 --> 25:11.177
ANGELA, ARE YOU HEARING WORDS
THAT I'M SAYING?

25:11.210 --> 25:12.178
WHAT?

25:12.211 --> 25:13.880
HELLO.

25:13.913 --> 25:16.048
I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON A PARTY FOR THREE WEEKS

25:16.082 --> 25:17.684
THAT JUST GOT THROWN
OUT THE WINDOW.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.719
SO NOW I HAVE TO PULL TOGETHER
A WHOLE NEW PARTY.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.688
AND MY USELESS
NUMBER TWO QUIT,

25:21.721 --> 25:23.990
SO NOW THERE'S NO ONE IN CHARGE
OF ORCHIDS, CHOCOLATES,

25:24.023 --> 25:25.692
OR THE THING
THAT'S MADE OF ICE.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.093
AND MY UPPER BACK ITCHES,
AND IT'S ITCHED ALL DAY,

25:27.126 --> 25:27.960
AND I CAN'T REACH IT.

25:27.994 --> 25:31.530
AND KEVIN HAD GREEK FOOD
FOR LUNCH AGAIN!

25:35.267 --> 25:37.704
THEY SAY YOU SHOULD NEVER
MIX BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE.

25:37.737 --> 25:38.771
REALLY?

25:38.805 --> 25:39.906
WELL THEN EXPLAIN TO ME

25:39.939 --> 25:43.643
HOW A PUTT-PUTT GOLF COMPANY
OPERATES.

25:43.676 --> 25:46.579
[telephone rings]

25:46.613 --> 25:48.247
YEP.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.650
(Pam)
THE PIZZA BY ALFREDO GUY
IS HERE.

25:50.683 --> 25:51.884
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY IT
LIKE THAT.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.986
I SAID IT NORMAL.

25:57.256 --> 25:58.991
(Michael)
HEY.
HEY.

25:59.025 --> 26:00.960
UH, $63.50, AND THAT'S
NOT INCLUDING TIP.

26:00.993 --> 26:04.864
RIGHT, I HAVE THE COUPON,
SO HALF OF $63.50,

26:04.897 --> 26:06.833
AND HALF THE TIP
ON $63.50...

26:06.866 --> 26:10.369
HALF-OFF COUPONS ONLY APPLY
TO ORDERS OF TWO PIZZAS.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.705
NO, I TOLD THEM ON THE PHONE
I WAS ORDERING EIGHT PIZZAS.

26:12.739 --> 26:13.840
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU TOLD THEM
ON THE PHONE.

26:13.873 --> 26:14.841
THAT'S OUR POLICY.

26:14.874 --> 26:16.876
YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY THINK

26:16.909 --> 26:18.745
THAT I WAS GONNA THAT I WAS
GONNA SPEND 60 BUCKS ON PIZZA?

26:18.778 --> 26:20.079
(Oscar)
IT'S NOT PIZZA.

26:20.112 --> 26:23.115
OKAY, IT DOESN'T SAY IT
ANYWHERE ON THE COUPON,

26:23.149 --> 26:27.186
AND IF IT'S YOUR POLICY,
IT SHOULD SAY IT ON THE COUPON.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.921
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

26:28.955 --> 26:30.056
NOT MY PROBLEM.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.991
IT IS YOUR PROBLEM.

26:32.024 --> 26:34.761
THAT'S NO WAY
TO DO BUSINESS, OKAY.

26:34.794 --> 26:38.665
I ORDERED EIGHT PIZZAS
WITH A HALF-OFF COUPON,

26:38.698 --> 26:41.868
SO I WOULD LIKE EIGHT PIZZAS
FOR HALF OFF, END OF STORY.

26:41.901 --> 26:43.402
GREAT STORY.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.905
$63.50, AND THAT'S NOT
INCLUDING TIP.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.339
I'M NOT GIVING THAT TO YOU.

26:47.373 --> 26:49.375
WELL, THEN, YOU'RE NOT
GETTING YOUR PIZZAS.

26:49.408 --> 26:51.043
NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT--
NO!

26:51.077 --> 26:53.680
YOU ARE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

26:53.713 --> 26:56.382
YOU'RE GOING TO STAY HERE
UNTIL WE FIGURE THIS OUT.

26:56.415 --> 26:57.383
WHAT?

26:57.416 --> 26:58.685
YOU KNOW WHAT,

26:58.718 --> 27:00.419
THIS YOUNG MAN
NEEDS TO LEARN

27:00.452 --> 27:03.422
THAT THAT'S NOT HOW
YOU TREAT PEOPLE.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.156
I DON'T CARE
IF IT'S PIZZA.

27:04.190 --> 27:07.026
GOOD BUSINESS
IS ABOUT RESPECT

27:07.059 --> 27:08.661
AND ACCOUNTABILITY

27:08.695 --> 27:09.395
AND FOLLOW-THROUGH.

27:09.428 --> 27:11.397
YOU DON'T JUST
MAKE PROMISES

27:11.430 --> 27:14.400
AND PULL THE RUG OUT
FROM UNDER SOMEBODY, DO YOU?

27:14.433 --> 27:15.935
DWIGHT, PLEASE
ESCORT THIS YOUNG MAN

27:15.968 --> 27:16.869
INTO THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

27:16.903 --> 27:18.738
RIGHT NOW.
GET INTO THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

27:18.771 --> 27:20.372
I'M NOT GOING IN THERE.
YEAH, YOU ARE.
YEAH, YOU ARE.

27:20.406 --> 27:21.941
AND YOU WILL COME OUT
WHEN YOU DECIDE TO GIVE ME

27:21.974 --> 27:23.209
A DISCOUNT ON THE PIZZA.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.411
PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

27:25.444 --> 27:26.378
THIS IS STUPID.

27:26.412 --> 27:29.982
NO, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT STUPID IS!

27:30.016 --> 27:32.018
IT'S ABOUT TO GET
ALL STUPID UP IN HERE!

27:45.732 --> 27:47.800
YOU FIND ANYTHING?

27:47.834 --> 27:50.737
WE THINK IT'S
A STRAIGHTFORWARD KIDNAPPING.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.872
STANLEY, COULD YOU
LOOK UP "ACCOMPLICES?"

27:52.905 --> 27:54.306
WHY CAN'T YOU GUYS
DO IT?

27:54.340 --> 27:56.442
BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING UP
"JAIL TIME."

27:56.475 --> 27:58.310
FINE.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.278
I'VE SEEN THIS KID BEFORE.

27:59.311 --> 28:00.880
HE'S ONE OF THE KIDS
THAT SNEAKS ONTO MY FARM

28:00.913 --> 28:02.114
AND STEALS MY HEMP.

28:02.148 --> 28:03.182
YEAH, I KNOW THAT GUY.

28:03.215 --> 28:06.052
HE'S THAT FARMER THAT GROWS
REALLY CRAPPY WEED.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.027
YOU READY TO GIVE ME
MY DISCOUNT NOW?

28:15.061 --> 28:16.162
NO.

28:16.195 --> 28:19.265
OKAY, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING
IN HERE THIS WHOLE TIME?

28:19.298 --> 28:20.299
WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS
IS THIS?

28:20.332 --> 28:21.768
WE'RE A PAPER COMPANY.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.469
THE BEST PAPER COMPANY
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD!

28:23.502 --> 28:26.405
DWIGHT, KNOCK IT OFF.

28:26.438 --> 28:28.975
YOU'D BETTER THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU ARE DOING, YOUNG MAN.

28:29.008 --> 28:30.276
YOU BETTER THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.311
NO.
I'M AN ADULT.

28:32.344 --> 28:35.181
I DON'T HAVE TO THINK
OR DO ANYTHING.

28:35.214 --> 28:35.982
YOU'RE A KID.

28:36.015 --> 28:38.250
YOU'RE A LITTLE
SNOT-NOSE PUNK KID

28:38.284 --> 28:40.352
WHO THINKS HE'S BETTER
THAN EVERYBODY ELSE.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.354
BECAUSE HE'S SOME
HOTSHOT.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.223
AND YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT SALES.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.525
SO STOP BEING A DISRESPECTFUL
LITTLE JERK, OKAY?

28:46.558 --> 28:47.827
SALES?

28:47.860 --> 28:49.128
YEAH, SALES.
YOU SELL PIZZA.

28:49.161 --> 28:50.396
LAST TIME I CHECKED
THAT'S CALLED SALES.

28:50.429 --> 28:51.397
YOU'RE SUCH A LOSER.

28:51.430 --> 28:52.531
WHAT DID YOU
JUST CALL HIM?!

28:52.564 --> 28:54.233
A LOSER.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

28:54.266 --> 28:55.434
A LOSER.
WHAT?

28:55.467 --> 28:57.169
OKAY, STOP IT.
STOP IT!
WHAT WAS THAT WORD?

28:57.203 --> 28:59.071
STOP GETTING HIM
TO SAY IT!

28:59.105 --> 29:00.439
(Michael)
YOU JUST MADE THIS WORSE.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.341
A WHOLE LOT WORSE.
I CAN MAKE HIM TALK,
MICHAEL.

29:02.374 --> 29:03.342
NO, NO, NO.

29:03.375 --> 29:04.343
(Oscar)
MICHAEL...

29:04.376 --> 29:05.411
(Stanley)
WE ARE ACCOMPLICES.

29:05.444 --> 29:06.946
[Michael shouting]
STOP TALKING ALL AT ONCE!

29:06.979 --> 29:08.314
YOU NEED TO LET HIM GO.

29:08.347 --> 29:09.916
LET GO OF LITTLE JERK BOY?

29:09.949 --> 29:11.450
BEFORE HE HAS LEARNED
HIS LESSON?

29:11.483 --> 29:12.852
YES.
YOU KNOW WHAT, JIM?

29:12.885 --> 29:14.821
THE WORLD WOULD BE
A BETTER PLACE

29:14.854 --> 29:17.156
IF PEOPLE WERE HELD ACCOUNTABLE
FOR THEIR ACTIONS.

29:17.189 --> 29:19.125
YES, BUT NOT BY
KIDNAPPING THEM.

29:19.158 --> 29:20.292
I'M NOT KIDNAPPING HIM.

29:20.326 --> 29:22.428
I AM KEEPING HIM UNTIL
I GET WHAT I WANT.

29:22.461 --> 29:23.863
AS A HOSTAGE.

29:23.896 --> 29:25.164
I THINK YOU'RE
OVERTHINKING IT.

29:25.197 --> 29:26.332
I THINK YOU'RE
UNDERTHINKING IT.

29:26.365 --> 29:29.201
YES, IS ALFREDO THERE?

29:29.235 --> 29:31.470
MAY I SPEAK
TO A MANAGER THEN?

29:31.503 --> 29:33.873
OKAY, COULD YOU TELL
THE MANAGER

29:33.906 --> 29:36.075
THE I AM KEEPING
HIS DELIVERY KID

29:36.108 --> 29:39.178
UNTIL I GET MY DISCOUNT
ON THE EIGHT PIZZAS I ORDERED?

29:39.211 --> 29:41.480
YES, I KNOW IT IS NOT
ON THE COUPON.

29:41.513 --> 29:48.821
ALSO, I WOULD LIKE HIM
TO THROW IN TWO--THREE PIZZAS

29:48.855 --> 29:50.857
UM, JUST FOR OUR...

29:50.890 --> 29:52.324
RANSOM.
TROUBLE.

29:53.625 --> 29:58.130
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

29:58.164 --> 29:59.999
WHAT'D HE SAY?
HE SAID NO.

30:00.032 --> 30:01.000
SO WE SHOULD LET HIM GO.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.936
NO, NO.

30:03.970 --> 30:06.605
(Dwight)
LISTEN UP, KID.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.240
I DON'T LIKE YOU,

30:08.274 --> 30:11.343
BUT BECAUSE SOME TOWN
IN SWITZERLAND SAYS SO,

30:11.377 --> 30:12.611
YOU HAVE RIGHTS.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.113
[knock on door]

30:17.516 --> 30:19.852
I HAVE TO HANG THESE.

30:27.927 --> 30:29.161
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT HER
LIKE THAT?

30:29.195 --> 30:30.462
HEY!

30:33.665 --> 30:35.834
[door shuts loudly]

30:41.040 --> 30:42.208
WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:42.241 --> 30:43.242
MICHAEL JUST CALLED
THE PIZZA PLACE

30:43.275 --> 30:44.376
WITH A LIST OF DEMANDS.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.212
MR. OVERDRAMATIC.
WHAT'S UP, KEVIN?

30:46.245 --> 30:49.882
WE'RE GETTING HUNGRY
OUT THERE.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.083
WE'RE ALL ACCOMPLICES NOW
ANYWAY.

30:51.117 --> 30:54.020
SO WE FIGURE
WE MIGHT AS WELL EAT.

30:54.053 --> 30:56.288
WE WOULD LIKE TO ORDER
SOME GOOD PIZZA

30:56.322 --> 30:59.358
FROM ALFREDO'S
PIZZA CAFE

30:59.391 --> 31:01.393
WHILE WE WAIT
FOR THE HOSTAGE SITUATION

31:01.427 --> 31:03.562
WITH THE BAD PIZZA
TO END.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.334
I NEEDED ANOTHER HOUR.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.202
IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE
IN ANOTHER HOUR.

31:10.236 --> 31:11.403
I THINK IT LOOKS GOOD.

31:11.437 --> 31:14.240
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT
IN CHARGE, MEREDITH.

31:14.273 --> 31:17.276
[White Stripes'
Seven Nation Army playing]

31:17.309 --> 31:19.145
*

31:19.178 --> 31:20.346
HERE YOU ARE, MY DEAR.

31:20.379 --> 31:24.483
ONE THING
MADE OF ICE.

31:24.516 --> 31:27.419
HOW DID YOU...UM--

31:27.453 --> 31:29.989
WHERE--WHERE DID YOU...

31:30.022 --> 31:30.990
IT'S JUST ICE.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.224
IT'LL MELT
ALL OVER THE FLOOR.

31:32.258 --> 31:33.659
WILL YOU HELP ME
PUT IT OVER THERE?

31:33.692 --> 31:35.194
YES, I WILL.
OKAY.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.395
EXCUSE ME.

31:36.428 --> 31:39.331
[whispering]
I STOLE IT.

31:42.568 --> 31:45.137
THANK GOD.

31:45.171 --> 31:46.072
MICHAEL.
HMM?

31:46.105 --> 31:47.573
RYAN WANTS TO INTRODUCE
THE BRANCH MANAGERS

31:47.606 --> 31:48.540
IN A FEW MINUTES.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.276
YOU JUST HAVE TO WAVE
AND INTRODUCE YOURSELF.

31:50.309 --> 31:52.344
I'LL JUST WAVE
AND INTRODUCE MYSELF.

31:52.378 --> 31:54.380
HEY, QUICK QUESTION.

31:54.413 --> 31:55.514
YEAH.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.349
[quietly]
IF I TAKE A PIZZA,

31:57.383 --> 31:59.318
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
TAKE SOME SODAS

31:59.351 --> 32:00.987
AND SOME NAPKINS
UP TO THE ROOF?

32:01.020 --> 32:02.221
I'M ALL OVER IT.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.556
OKAY.

32:04.590 --> 32:05.657
WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?

32:05.691 --> 32:07.059
GOOD PIZZA.
YEAH?

32:07.093 --> 32:07.926
MM-HMM.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.528
CHEESE, OR DO WE HAVE
OTHER FLAVORS?

32:09.561 --> 32:10.696
DIFFERENT STUFF.

32:10.729 --> 32:12.431
WHICH ONE'S THIS?
PERFECT.

32:15.301 --> 32:16.702
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT YOU SAID TO ME

32:16.735 --> 32:18.370
ON MY FIRST DAY
AT WORK,

32:18.404 --> 32:19.671
JUST BEFORE YOU WALKED ME
OVER TO MY DESK?

32:19.705 --> 32:22.241
YEAH.

32:22.274 --> 32:23.309
"ENJOY THIS MOMENT

32:23.342 --> 32:25.277
"BECAUSE YOU'RE NEVER GOING
TO GO BACK TO THIS TIME

32:25.311 --> 32:27.346
BEFORE YOU MET
YOUR DESKMATE DWIGHT."

32:27.379 --> 32:30.016
AND THAT'S WHEN I KNEW.

32:30.049 --> 32:31.383
YOU?

32:31.417 --> 32:33.252
YOU CAME UP TO MY DESK
AND YOU SAID,

32:33.285 --> 32:35.687
"THIS MIGHT SOUND WEIRD,
MM-HMM.

32:35.721 --> 32:38.290
"AND THERE'S NO REASON
FOR ME TO KNOW THIS,

32:38.324 --> 32:40.526
"BUT THAT MIXED BERRY YOGURT
YOU'RE ABOUT TO EAT

32:40.559 --> 32:42.028
HAS EXPIRED."

32:42.061 --> 32:43.662
THAT WAS THE MOMENT
THAT YOU KNEW YOU LIKED ME?

32:43.695 --> 32:45.397
YEP.

32:45.431 --> 32:49.001
WOW.

32:49.035 --> 32:50.202
CAN WE MAKE IT
A DIFFERENT MOMENT?

32:50.236 --> 32:51.203
NOPE.

32:51.237 --> 32:53.205
OH.

32:53.239 --> 32:55.474
CAN I START TALKING?

32:55.507 --> 32:56.608
IS THIS THING ON?

32:56.642 --> 33:01.380
GIVE ME--GIVE ME A SIGNAL
WHEN YOU WANT ME TO START.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.715
AND NOW,
FROM MY OLD HOMETOWN,

33:03.749 --> 33:05.351
SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA,

33:05.384 --> 33:09.121
MY FORMER BOSS,
MICHAEL SCOTT.

33:09.155 --> 33:10.156
HEY, I JUST THINK
YOU SHOULD KNOW

33:10.189 --> 33:13.292
THAT ONE OF MY SALESMEN BEAT
YOUR STUPID COMPUTER.

33:13.325 --> 33:18.030
SO TAKE THAT, [bleep].

33:18.064 --> 33:21.467
ALWAYS A JOKESTER.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.236
HOW 'BOUT THAT IMAGE?
CRYSTAL CLEAR.

33:24.270 --> 33:26.072
I WANT TO GIVE A SPECIAL...

33:26.105 --> 33:27.139
IF ANYONE OUT THERE
IS LISTENING,

33:27.173 --> 33:29.341
I'M BEING HELD HERE
AGAINST MY WILL.

33:29.375 --> 33:32.278
I'M A MINOR.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.314
OW!

33:35.347 --> 33:36.748
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33:36.782 --> 33:38.817
YOU SAID
YOUR UPPER BACK ITCHED.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.253
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO SCRATCH IT.

33:41.287 --> 33:42.388
LOOK, ANGELA,
I KNOW THIS IS WEIRD

33:42.421 --> 33:43.322
BECAUSE WE WORK TOGETHER,

33:43.355 --> 33:45.324
BECAUSE UP UNTIL
AND POSSIBLY INCLUDING NOW,

33:45.357 --> 33:47.259
I'VE REPULSED YOU.

33:47.293 --> 33:49.195
BUT I LIKE YOU.

33:49.228 --> 33:50.329
I'M NOT DATING YOU.

33:53.432 --> 33:57.303
SO ANGELA IS STUBBORN
AS A MULE.

33:57.336 --> 33:59.338
SHE'S GIVING OFF
FAIRLY STRONG VIBES

33:59.371 --> 34:02.274
THAT SHE'S NOT INTERESTED.

34:05.377 --> 34:08.514
BUT DO I LIKE HER OR NOT?

34:08.547 --> 34:14.486
BECAUSE IF I LIKE HER,
THEN I CAN'T BACK DOWN.

34:14.520 --> 34:18.224
IF YOU'RE GOING NUMBER ONE
YOU'VE GOT TEN MORE SECONDS!

34:19.825 --> 34:22.228
HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN JIM?

34:22.261 --> 34:23.529
I GUESS HE WANTED
TO GET OUT OF HERE

34:23.562 --> 34:25.097
BEFORE THE COPS FIND OUT.

34:26.798 --> 34:28.200
[sighs]

34:28.234 --> 34:29.368
(Dwight)
AAAH--AAAAAH!

34:29.401 --> 34:30.802
HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

34:30.836 --> 34:32.204
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M JUST SCARING HIM.

34:32.238 --> 34:33.305
THE TRICK IS TO
MAKE HIM THINK

34:33.339 --> 34:34.540
YOU'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING
TO HIM.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.408
I CAN HEAR YOU, MAN.
SHUT UP!

34:36.442 --> 34:37.409
OR I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU
IN THE THROAT!

34:37.443 --> 34:38.410
HEY, HEY, HEY.
STOP IT!

34:38.444 --> 34:39.811
STOP IT! NO.

34:39.845 --> 34:42.481
GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

34:42.514 --> 34:43.549
OH, MY GOD.

34:43.582 --> 34:47.386
NO, NO, NO.

34:47.419 --> 34:48.854
[quietly]
I KIDNAPPED A KID.

34:48.887 --> 34:50.256
YOU HAD TO.

34:50.289 --> 34:51.390
WHAT OTHER CHOICE
DID YOU HAVE?

34:51.423 --> 34:53.259
I'VE GOTTA PAY
FOR THE PIZZA.

34:53.292 --> 34:56.862
WELL...YEAH.

34:56.895 --> 34:58.430
[sharp sigh]

34:58.464 --> 35:00.532
OH, MY GOD.

35:00.566 --> 35:01.567
OH, MY GOD.

35:03.802 --> 35:04.970
[phone rings]
THIS IS MICHAEL.

35:05.003 --> 35:05.904
[Ryan on speakerphone]
HELLO, MICHAEL, THIS IS RYAN.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.839
FIRST OFF,
THANKS FOR THE SHOUT-OUT.

35:07.873 --> 35:09.575
YOU'RE BREAKING UP.
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.577
(Ryan)
WHY IS THERE A KID
ON YOUR WEB CAM

35:11.610 --> 35:13.612
SAYING THAT HE'S BEING HELD
AGAINST HIS WI--

35:13.645 --> 35:14.646
[disconnects phone]

35:14.680 --> 35:16.315
OKAY.

35:16.348 --> 35:18.617
I WANT YOU
TO GO IN THERE

35:18.650 --> 35:22.321
AND PAY HIM
FOR THE PIZZAS,

35:22.354 --> 35:23.822
AND GIVE HIM A GENEROUS TIP.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.824
NO MORE THAN 10%.

35:25.857 --> 35:27.259
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

35:27.293 --> 35:30.296
I...WILL OPEN THE DOOR.

35:30.329 --> 35:31.430
YEAH?

35:31.463 --> 35:32.631
AND HOPEFULLY

35:32.664 --> 35:36.235
HE WILL WALK OUT.

35:36.268 --> 35:39.805
AND THE REST IS OUT
OF OUR HANDS.

35:39.838 --> 35:42.441
SO I'M PAYING FULL PRICE?

35:42.474 --> 35:43.942
YES.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.378
(Dwight)
HERE WE GO.

35:46.412 --> 35:49.415

35:49.448 --> 35:52.318
HERE'S TWO MORE.

35:55.854 --> 35:58.156

36:00.492 --> 36:02.328
OKAY.

36:02.361 --> 36:03.229
NOW WHAT?

36:03.262 --> 36:07.833
NOW WE WAIT AND HOPE
THAT NOTHING HAPPENS.

36:07.866 --> 36:08.967
ALL RIGHT.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.236
OH, I ASSUME I'M GOING
TO BE REIMBURSED

36:10.269 --> 36:11.069
FOR THE PIZZAS?

36:11.102 --> 36:13.539
NOT NOW, DWIGHT, PLEASE.
NOT THE TIME.

36:15.341 --> 36:17.343
A TOAST.

36:17.376 --> 36:19.678
BETTER MAKE IT GOOD.

36:19.711 --> 36:23.282
TO AVOIDING A CLASS 2
FELONY CHARGE.

SCRANTON GUY.

39:34.506 --> 39:35.974

39:36.007 --> 39:38.009
[laughs]
I LIKED YOUR
STATEMENT TONIGHT.

39:38.043 --> 39:39.611
OH. OKAY. THANKS.

39:39.645 --> 39:40.846
[chuckles]

39:40.879 --> 39:43.148

THAT BEAT THE COMPUTER.

39:43.181 --> 39:44.816
OH, VERY COOL.

39:44.850 --> 39:47.419
IT WAS FUNNY TO SEE RYAN
ALL EMBARRASSED BY THAT.

39:47.453 --> 39:48.454
YEAH.
[snickers]

39:48.487 --> 39:50.121
SEE YOU LATER.

39:51.122 --> 39:52.691

39:52.724 --> 39:54.159
[chuckles]

39:54.192 --> 39:56.462
[mocking voice]
I'M RYAN, AND...

39:56.495 --> 39:59.631
AND IT DIDN'T GO THE WAY
THAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD.

39:59.665 --> 40:02.100
BECAUSE...IT DIDN'T
WORK OUT FOR ME.

40:02.133 --> 40:04.135
I'M VERY EMBARRASSED.

40:04.169 --> 40:06.037
I HAVE EGG
ALL OVER MY FACE.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.138
AND...
I'M 12 YEARS OLD.

40:07.172 --> 40:09.441
I SPENT SO MUCH TIME
IN SCRANTON,

40:09.475 --> 40:10.876
BUT I NEVER SOLD
ANY PAPER.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.512
I NEVER SOLD ANY PAPER,
AND I'M AN IDIOT.

40:13.545 --> 40:16.114
I STARTED A FIRE
WITH MY CHEESE PEELER.

40:16.147 --> 40:17.148
I--I--

40:17.182 --> 40:18.617
AND DATED
AN INDIAN GIRL.

40:18.650 --> 40:21.152
I STARTED A FIRE.
I STARTED A FIRE.

40:21.186 --> 40:22.454
NOW I GOT A BEARD.

40:22.488 --> 40:24.155
AND I HAVE NEW SHOES,

40:24.189 --> 40:25.591
AND I'M YOUR BOSS.

40:25.624 --> 40:27.192
I'M HOT.
I'M SO HOT.

40:27.225 --> 40:28.827
THAT--THAT'S WHY
EVERYBODY--

40:28.860 --> 40:31.062
I DON'T GET--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

40:31.096 --> 40:32.898
THAT'S PART OF IT.
IT'S JUST...

40:34.733 --> 40:36.067
[sighs]

40:50.048 --> 40:52.250
WANNA HEAD BACK?

40:52.283 --> 40:53.952
