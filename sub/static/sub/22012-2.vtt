00:01.535 --> 00:04.138
ADULT ADAM: Back in the '80s,
being the only kid
in my school

00:04.138 --> 00:06.507
with his own video camera
had its advantages.

00:06.507 --> 00:07.675
Most notably, I could use it

00:07.675 --> 00:10.511
to get out of
tough homework assignments.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.347
Rolling.
For example, AP Spanish.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.549
By the power of Grayskull!

00:15.549 --> 00:17.551
(THUNDER CRASHES)

00:17.551 --> 00:20.754
I have the power

00:20.754 --> 00:23.357
of espanol!

00:23.357 --> 00:26.794
Me gusta las manzanas!

00:26.794 --> 00:27.861
(APPLAUSE)

00:27.861 --> 00:28.829
ADULT ADAM: The movies
I made for school

00:28.829 --> 00:31.265
never failed to dazzle
my teachers.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.767
(SIGHS) Well, that content
was shockingly simple.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.370
But wow.
You have a video camera.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.638
That's not nothing.

00:37.638 --> 00:38.806
A-plus, senor!

00:38.806 --> 00:41.342
It was the ultimate scam
to get out of work

00:41.342 --> 00:42.510
I didn't want to do.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.679
Athletics saves lives!

00:45.679 --> 00:47.715
Get fit, or you'll end up
like this!

00:47.715 --> 00:50.718
Ah, damn it.
My foot swelled up again.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.353
Bevy, help me!

00:52.353 --> 00:54.688
Ugh!
Aah, it's locked in tight!

00:57.758 --> 01:00.328
That's a moving
cautionary tale, Goldfarb.

01:00.328 --> 01:02.330
You can sit out dodgeball
for the whole week.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.132
ADULT ADAM: Even the toughest
teachers in school

01:04.132 --> 01:05.866
fell for my homework hack.
Like Doc,

01:05.866 --> 01:08.502
the classic '80s teacher who
was rough around the edges

01:08.502 --> 01:10.304
and a sniper
with a piece of chalk.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.805
Yeah, this kind
of student cruelty

01:11.805 --> 01:13.541
was only a thing of the past.

01:13.541 --> 01:14.742
All right, I hope you
were all taking notes,

01:14.742 --> 01:16.210
'cause it's
term-paper time.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.346
I want 10 pages
on World War II,

01:18.346 --> 01:20.214
not including
bibliography.

01:20.214 --> 01:23.384
(STUDENTS GROAN)
Would you prefer double-spaced
or triple-spaced?

01:24.752 --> 01:25.686
Hey, that was close!

01:25.686 --> 01:27.721
It's called a warning shot,
fresh mouth.

01:27.721 --> 01:30.324
Always single-spaced.
Goldberg, speak.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.693
As you may know, filmmaking
has been a passion of mine

01:32.693 --> 01:34.628
since my early years here
at William Penn.

01:34.628 --> 01:37.131
Yeah. I think we all know how
that's held you back socially.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.098
Indeed.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.168
I was wondering if,
instead of the paper,

01:40.168 --> 01:42.303
you'd accept
a cinematic re-creation

01:42.303 --> 01:43.804
of an important event
from the war.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.673
Sounds like someone's trying
to get out of doing real work.

01:45.673 --> 01:46.740
Other teachers
have said yes,

01:46.740 --> 01:49.243
and they've been very pleased
with the results.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.279
Ask around the lounge.
I think you'll hear
good things.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.447
I am no longer welcome
in that lounge.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.417
Lucky for you, Doc likes
a good World War II movie.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.818
But you better wow me,
or it's an F.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.353
High stakes.
I like that game.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.588
He gets to make
a movie?

02:00.588 --> 02:03.391
Seriously, why does everyone
jump up and down for this kid

02:03.391 --> 02:05.526
just 'cause his parents
spoiled him with
a video camera?

02:05.526 --> 02:07.228
Son, it is taking
all my energy

02:07.228 --> 02:08.729
not to chuck an eraser
at your head.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.399
Dave Kim's voice
will not be silenced!

02:12.400 --> 02:13.667
How is this
allowed?

02:13.667 --> 02:15.469
(CHUCKLES)

02:15.469 --> 02:16.837
* I'm twisted up inside

02:16.837 --> 02:20.441
* But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

02:22.910 --> 02:24.212
* I don't know the future

02:24.212 --> 02:28.516
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:28.516 --> 02:30.484
ADULT ADAM: It was October 4,
1980-something,

02:30.484 --> 02:32.353
and my sister, Erica,
was in college,

02:32.353 --> 02:33.787
parent-free and loving life.

02:33.787 --> 02:34.922
Damn washing machine!

02:34.922 --> 02:35.723
Well, kind of.

02:35.723 --> 02:36.724
My jeans are
completely bleached

02:36.724 --> 02:39.193
and not in the cool,
acid-washed kind of way.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.295
How much, like, bleach
did you use?

02:41.295 --> 02:42.496
I don't know. One?

02:42.496 --> 02:43.764
One bleach?

02:43.764 --> 02:45.899
You realize you have, like,
no basic life skills,

02:45.899 --> 02:46.834
and it's gross.

02:46.834 --> 02:47.835
Okay, I just messed up
a little laundry.

02:47.835 --> 02:51.272
As if! I mean, look at
your side of the room.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.440
It's a total
garbage heap.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.807
It's an organized heap.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.709
I have a system. (CHUCKLES)

02:55.709 --> 02:58.212
It's like you don't know how
to pick up after yourself

02:58.212 --> 03:00.714
or make a bed for yourself
or feed yourself.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.417
What? I prefer to eat out
because I don't know
how to cook

03:03.417 --> 03:05.553
ramen or boil a cow
or whatever.

03:05.553 --> 03:08.422
Look, we're friends and stuff,
but if you don't learn

03:08.422 --> 03:10.458
how to take care of yourself,
I'll talk to the RA

03:10.458 --> 03:11.759
and get you evicted
or whatever.

03:11.759 --> 03:12.960
You can't do that!

03:12.960 --> 03:14.328
Oh, I can.

03:14.328 --> 03:15.596
Get it together,
or you'll be living

03:15.596 --> 03:17.298
in the mature-students dorm.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.500
I can't live with moms
who are going back to school

03:19.500 --> 03:20.768
to get their lives
on track!

03:20.768 --> 03:23.804
You either learn fast, or your
new roomie will be a divorcee

03:23.804 --> 03:26.006
who takes pottery classes
and listens to Yanni.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.475
Not Yanni!

03:27.475 --> 03:28.742
Yanni.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.344
Okay, I am an adult.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.380
I can fix this on my own.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.582
ADULT ADAM: But she couldn't,
so she came home instead.

03:34.582 --> 03:35.749
We need to talk, woman!

03:35.749 --> 03:36.884
(GASPS)

03:36.884 --> 03:38.252
Sweet God,
am I dreaming?

03:38.252 --> 03:39.420
You ruined my life!

03:39.420 --> 03:40.354
Dang it. It's real.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.022
In my dreams,
we wear matching sweaters

03:42.022 --> 03:43.624
and you drown me
in nub-nubs.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.893
Mom, I'm a total mess
at college.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.529
Because of you, I've never had
to clean or cook

03:48.529 --> 03:50.631
or act like a human
in the real world.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.466
Are you saying
I failed as a mother

03:52.466 --> 03:54.302
by being too good
of a mother?

03:54.302 --> 03:55.168
Yes!

03:55.168 --> 03:57.471
I am bleached
and stinky and hungry.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.940
Aw. Well, let Mama
do your dirty laundry

03:59.940 --> 04:02.476
and fill you with eggs
and breads and meats.

04:02.476 --> 04:05.346
Well, I kind of took
a bus at 5:00 a.m.
to learn adult skills,

04:05.346 --> 04:07.481
but your thing
sounds way easier.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.882
Feed me the meats!

04:08.882 --> 04:10.518
(CHUCKLES)

04:10.518 --> 04:12.052
Why are you here?
Why are you eating my meats?

04:12.052 --> 04:13.687
Hi, Daddy.
Huge news, Murray.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.523
Erica's gonna come home
every weekend

04:15.523 --> 04:16.924
so I can care for
her needs!

04:16.924 --> 04:17.958
That's ridiculous.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.360
She's got to learn
how to take care of herself,

04:19.360 --> 04:20.461
not have you baby her.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.495
No!
Let her baby me,

04:21.495 --> 04:23.364
or I'll be rooming
with someone's colorful aunt

04:23.364 --> 04:24.665
who's trying to
reinvent herself,

04:24.665 --> 04:26.567
but she can't
because it's too late.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.035
Stop eating my meats.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.538
No babying,
just teaching.

04:30.538 --> 04:32.906
You act like I baby them
on purpose, Murray.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.875
Mom, I'm starving!

04:34.875 --> 04:37.044
Turn this magic dust
into pancakes for me?

04:37.044 --> 04:38.078
No!

04:38.078 --> 04:39.680
This stops now, moron!

04:39.680 --> 04:41.482
Make them yourself
like an adult.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.817
Fine!

04:43.817 --> 04:47.020
Ah.
Now all we do is wait.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.155
Start now.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.624
Start teaching them how to
live without their mother

04:50.624 --> 04:52.426
so they don't end up
here forever.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.662
ADULT ADAM: While my dad tried
to help his helpless kids,

04:54.662 --> 04:56.497
Pops was patiently waiting

04:56.497 --> 04:58.432
to hang with his favorite
grandson.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.368
Oop!
There he is.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.803
You all ready to hit
the auction house, kiddo?

05:02.803 --> 05:04.838
(SIGHS)
I'm sorry. I can't go.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.840
But we pretend
we're titans of industry

05:06.840 --> 05:09.577
and drive up all the prices
of the nonsense art.

05:09.577 --> 05:10.811
Pops, I'm busy.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.680
I'm in high school.
I got a girlfriend.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.515
I'm making a movie
on World War II.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.884
World War II?
Why didn't you say so?

05:16.884 --> 05:18.852
That's my war!
Let me help.

05:18.852 --> 05:21.121
Guess I could interview you
and get some cool stories.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.757
You want stories?
I got stories.

05:23.757 --> 05:26.594
Did I ever tell you
about my crazy friend Boxy

05:26.594 --> 05:27.828
in basic training?

05:27.828 --> 05:30.364
Ooh, this is good.
Was he a boxer?

05:30.364 --> 05:33.867
No. We called him Boxy
'cause his family owned
a box factory.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.804
He tripped over a table
in the mess hall,
hurt his foot,

05:36.804 --> 05:39.106
was sent home,
became an orthodontist.

05:39.106 --> 05:42.009
Okay. Well, maybe you
should talk more about

05:42.009 --> 05:43.310
the actual war stuff.

05:43.310 --> 05:46.814
Well, for most of the war,
I was actually on
a supply ship.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.016
Shipping bullets
and bombs and stuff?

05:49.016 --> 05:51.118
Mostly canvas.
And rope.

05:51.118 --> 05:54.087
And one time,
we were loaded up
with pants.

05:54.087 --> 05:57.991
Yeah, I think I want my movie
to be less about pants

05:57.991 --> 06:00.828
and more about
saving the world.

06:00.828 --> 06:01.995
But we can hang out
some other time.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.633
ADULT ADAM: Pops could see
he was losing me.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.735
So in that moment, he decided
to spice things up

06:07.735 --> 06:10.003
with some stories
from the classic '60s sitcom,

06:10.003 --> 06:11.104
Hogan's Heroes.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.205
Oh, I got one.

06:12.205 --> 06:16.477
My supply ship got captured
and I was taken prisoner.

06:16.477 --> 06:19.079
Prisoner?
Why didn't you lead with that?

06:19.079 --> 06:20.514
I was building up to it.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.749
And I was hooked.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.717
Every tale Pops told
was better than the last!

06:23.717 --> 06:26.053
And we got all our
instructions from London

06:26.053 --> 06:28.922
through a radio we had hidden
in a coffee pot.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.157
That does make sense.

06:30.157 --> 06:33.494
I had to convince the colonel
to let me form a jazz band,

06:33.494 --> 06:35.529
which would trigger
an avalanche.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.329
Unbelievable.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.065
The chimpanzee
had nowhere to go,

06:38.065 --> 06:42.102
so it only made sense
he live with us
in our barracks.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.671
This is gonna be
an awesome movie!

06:43.671 --> 06:44.872
The script is gonna
write itself!

06:44.872 --> 06:46.474
Go get 'em, Slugger.

06:46.474 --> 06:48.876
I'm just gonna jog
the ol' memory.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.944
While Pops got schooled on
Hogan's Heroes,

06:50.944 --> 06:54.582
my mom was reluctantly
teaching Erica and Barry
life skills.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.016
And you
pinch the shoulders,

06:56.016 --> 06:58.986
flip in the sleeves,
and hello,

06:58.986 --> 07:00.888
store-quality
folded shirt.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.756
Hope you're happy,
Erica.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.526
I was enjoying my life
of leisure with my mom-butler

07:05.526 --> 07:06.193
and you ruined it.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.160
Calm down.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.663
All we're doing is learning
a few easy things

07:09.663 --> 07:10.831
to appease your father.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.533
Yeah,
learning won't hurt.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.668
Then we wouldn't have to leave
an awesome place like college

07:14.668 --> 07:16.169
to go to a lame place
like here.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.972
So you want to learn
so you can leave?

07:18.972 --> 07:22.576
Exactly.
Help us leave you.
Mmm.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.712
After hearing my sister's
change of heart,

07:24.712 --> 07:26.747
my mom decided
not to teach them,

07:26.747 --> 07:28.148
but to bring them down.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.316
Okay, then.

07:29.316 --> 07:32.686
Uh, let's start with something
simple, a fitted sheet.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.254
If you can't fold
a simple sheet,

07:34.254 --> 07:35.723
there's really no hope
for you.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.157
What the hell?

07:37.157 --> 07:39.059
Where does it begin,
and where does it end?

07:39.059 --> 07:40.994
Just give it to me, dude.
I'll show you how to do it.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.596
Oh! Oh, no!
I'm stuck!

07:42.596 --> 07:44.231
I'm stuck inside!
I'm inside of the sheet!

07:44.231 --> 07:45.666
You got it?

07:45.666 --> 07:47.267
ERICA: No. Oh, wait.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.702
BARRY: Oh, no.
Grab the stretchy part.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.037
Nope, that's not
the stretchy part!

07:50.037 --> 07:52.773
I'm gonna die in here!
You're making it worse!

07:55.142 --> 07:58.746
Oh, my God.
You are so good
at Mom stuff.

07:58.746 --> 08:01.048
I know.
It's so frustrating.

08:01.048 --> 08:03.884
You can't come
to where I am.

08:03.884 --> 08:06.687
I wish there was a way
I could go someplace.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.222
Wait!
What if you came to us?

08:09.222 --> 08:10.157
Say it, Erica.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.593
Say every detail
of every idea you just had.

08:12.593 --> 08:13.761
Every weekend,
you can visit

08:13.761 --> 08:17.130
and clean my filthy dorm,
cook me food, and do laundry

08:17.130 --> 08:19.132
while I'm at class
and partying with my friends.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.768
What about me?
Fine.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.102
She can
alternate weekends.

08:22.102 --> 08:25.539
You just solved
your unsolvable problem!

08:25.539 --> 08:27.307
Yay!

08:27.307 --> 08:30.644
Hey, morons.
Let me get this straight.

08:30.644 --> 08:33.847
You two have officially
decided to let your mom
take care of you

08:33.847 --> 08:35.048
for the rest
of your lives.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.617
She seems
very open to it.

08:36.617 --> 08:37.818
Of course she is.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.186
How do you not see what she's
doing after all this time?

08:39.186 --> 08:42.222
Dude, do you think
she gave us the impossible
sheet on purpose?

08:42.222 --> 08:45.659
Yes. She manipulates you into
needing her week after week.

08:45.659 --> 08:46.994
What are you
talking about?

08:46.994 --> 08:49.763
She made up a medical
condition so she could
have a sleepover

08:49.763 --> 08:52.933
with you in your dorm
on your first night
of college.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.568
Well, that certainly is
an example.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.036
Well, it ends today!

08:56.036 --> 08:58.806
Mom will no longer control me
with her mommery.

08:58.806 --> 09:01.308
Yeah! Let's stick it to her
by learning the life skills

09:01.308 --> 09:02.976
that we should've learned
as small children.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.312
I'm scared,
but I'm in.

09:05.312 --> 09:08.682
Take my hand, Father.
Leap with us into the unknown.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.888
Thank you, and welcome.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.825
Once in a generation,
a student project comes along

09:17.825 --> 09:20.227
that not only triggers
an automatic A,

09:20.227 --> 09:23.330
but launches an illustrious
filmmaking career.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.232
Get to it, Rex Reed.
I got a whole bucket here.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.266
ADAM: Enjoy.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.101
(MUSIC PLAYING ON TV)

09:28.101 --> 09:30.938
The year was 1943,

09:30.938 --> 09:35.008
and I was a prisoner of war
behind enemy lines.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.648
As fate would have it,
the camp was guarded

09:40.648 --> 09:45.352
by two bumbling fools who I
outsmarted on a weekly basis.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.721
If it wasn't for me,
Colonel Klink

09:47.721 --> 09:50.090
and his surprisingly
lovable sidekick,

09:50.090 --> 09:53.293
Sergeant Schultz,
would have won the war!

09:53.293 --> 09:56.096
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

10:00.734 --> 10:02.069
All right, Goldberg.
Stop the tape.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.771
(MUSIC STOPS)
Is this some kind of joke?

10:03.771 --> 10:05.839
I know what you're thinking.
It's too good.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.875
This is not your grandfather's
war story.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.309
You stole it
from Hogan's Heroes.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.278
No! I've never even
seen that show.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.146
This came straight
from my grandfather.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.883
I demand an apology
and an A-plus!

10:15.883 --> 10:18.151
More like an F and a week's
detention for being a liar!

10:24.357 --> 10:25.759
What was that?
Nothing.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.194
Did you just throw
my chalk back at me?

10:27.194 --> 10:28.729
(SCOFFS) Wha...

10:28.729 --> 10:30.397
You threw it to me.
I threw it back at you.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.899
It's a game of catch!
We have fun!

10:31.899 --> 10:33.433
Principal's office.
Now.

10:33.433 --> 10:34.735
Way ahead of you.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.272
ADULT ADAM:
After turning Pops'
war stories into cinema,

10:39.272 --> 10:41.909
only enemy
in my teacher's eyes was me.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.276
Sorry.

10:43.276 --> 10:46.113
Doc is insisting that
your grandfather's stories
are all lies.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.081
I will never
believe that!

10:48.081 --> 10:50.183
That's a year's detention,
you sassy bastard!

10:50.183 --> 10:52.452
Okay!
Everybody calm down.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.788
Mr. Goldberg,
you know that plagiarism

10:54.788 --> 10:56.790
is a very serious
academic crime.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.325
I didn't plagiarize
anything!

10:58.325 --> 10:59.927
Let's go to the tape, then,
shall we?

10:59.927 --> 11:02.062
Let's.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.396
Please, Colonel Solomon!
Please, Colonel Hogan!

11:03.396 --> 11:05.165
(TOGETHER) How else
do we get the tank in?

11:05.165 --> 11:06.366
(BOTH STUTTER) Tank?

11:06.366 --> 11:08.035
(TOGETHER)
So we can take it apart.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.837
It's only until tomorrow,

11:09.837 --> 11:11.739
and then he's gonna
take it off again...

11:11.739 --> 11:12.840
(BOTH SIGH)

11:12.840 --> 11:14.141
(TOGETHER) ...after
he steals the tank...

11:14.141 --> 11:15.142
Oh?

11:15.142 --> 11:16.209
...from the Panzer Division...
Oh!

11:16.209 --> 11:18.078
...and brings it here
into the barracks.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.980
Oh, I see nothing!

11:19.980 --> 11:21.715
I was not here!

11:21.715 --> 11:23.817
I did not even
get up this morning...

11:25.853 --> 11:28.488
Wow.
That is incriminating.

11:28.488 --> 11:31.458
I guess we have to
face facts.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.261
Hogan stole that story
from my grandfather.

11:34.261 --> 11:37.130
No, wait!
Hogan is my grandfather!

11:37.130 --> 11:38.966
Oh, and I'm Granny from
The Beverly Hillbillies.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.133
Give it up!
Never!

11:40.133 --> 11:41.802
Pops is my best friend
in the world,

11:41.802 --> 11:43.303
and there's no way
he'd lie to me.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.344
Yeah, I lied to you.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.813
Balls, man!

11:52.813 --> 11:54.815
Big balls!
I'm in real trouble here!

11:54.815 --> 11:56.016
I could be expelled.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.885
Wait. That movie
was for school?

11:57.885 --> 11:58.952
Yes.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.188
I made a movie instead of
writing a term paper.

12:01.188 --> 12:03.190
Why do they keep
letting you make movies

12:03.190 --> 12:04.892
instead of doing
actual work?

12:04.892 --> 12:06.760
It's a Quaker school.
It's very loose.

12:06.760 --> 12:07.627
I'm sorry.

12:07.627 --> 12:09.763
I didn't mean to get you
in trouble.

12:09.763 --> 12:12.265
I was just excited
to spend time together again.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.767
(SIGHS)
Now I feel terrible.

12:13.767 --> 12:14.734
Don't feel terrible.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.770
Same thing happened
with Erica and Barry.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.906
Everybody grows up.
Tell you what,

12:18.906 --> 12:22.075
I'm gonna go talk to your
teacher and fix this mishegas.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.176
He won't listen.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.445
He's a hard-ass and a sniper
with a piece of chalk.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.547
I can handle him.
I fought in the war.

12:27.547 --> 12:30.450
Don't you mean you
brought pants to the boat
that went to the war?

12:30.450 --> 12:32.853
ADULT ADAM: As Pops enlisted
to fight for my grade,

12:32.853 --> 12:36.323
my brother and sister
had been defeated by an enemy
close to home.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.324
Unbelievable!

12:37.324 --> 12:40.093
The way that woman fed us,
cleaned our rooms,

12:40.093 --> 12:41.161
loved us day and night...

12:41.161 --> 12:43.130
She's been playing us
for suckers!

12:43.130 --> 12:45.098
We should have seen
the caring and nurturing

12:45.098 --> 12:46.967
for what it was,
a ruse!

12:46.967 --> 12:49.336
Erica?
Oh, my God! You're back!

12:49.336 --> 12:51.038
Did you come all this way
to surprise me?

12:51.038 --> 12:52.205
Oh, man!

12:52.205 --> 12:54.107
Uh, I mean, hey, you!

12:54.107 --> 12:55.575
I've missed you
so much!

12:55.575 --> 12:58.846
Same. But also, I am kind of
busy dealing with this thing.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.580
Oh, can I help?
Do you know
how to do laundry?

13:00.580 --> 13:02.582
Totally. There's this
laundry chute by my bedroom,

13:02.582 --> 13:03.884
and I just put
all my dirty clothes in it.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.986
And then a few days later,
boom, they're back
in my drawer.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.387
You're useless to me.
Yep.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.588
Wait! Wait.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.958
I know someone who's been
surviving on his own forever.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.392
He can teach us
for sure.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.062
Who?
The wisest man I know.

13:15.062 --> 13:17.430
Well, you've come to the right
efficiency apartment.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.999
My perpetual single-tude

13:18.999 --> 13:21.268
has given me an amazing array
of domestic skills.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.235
Make yourselves at home

13:22.235 --> 13:25.839
in my living room/gym/
sitting area/lanai.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.441
Brisket? I made that in
my gentleman's Crock-Pot.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.309
So tender!

13:29.309 --> 13:31.178
It falls apart
at fork's first touch.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.312
Also, how long are
we gonna be here?

13:32.312 --> 13:34.447
Dude, look at
the laundry basket!

13:34.447 --> 13:36.549
Is that one of those
impossible-to-fold sheets

13:36.549 --> 13:37.417
Mom was
tricking us with?

13:37.417 --> 13:41.121
You mean fitted?
I've danced with a few.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.956
ERICA:
They're perfect.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.458
You folded them?
How'd you find the corners?

13:45.458 --> 13:47.294
You don't find the corners
of the sheet.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.595
The corners find you.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.297
Teach us everything
you know, Coach.

13:50.297 --> 13:53.166
* Never surrender
Very well.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.268
If you got the heart
and the will to win

13:55.268 --> 13:57.004
and you have
a basic understanding

13:57.004 --> 13:58.906
of how to use a vacuum,

13:58.906 --> 14:01.408
then your training
in the domestic arts
begins now!

14:04.577 --> 14:06.179
It's all from here.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.381
And then you just
power through the seams.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.250
Let your hips do the work.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.221
Ten-hut!
What's all this now?

14:14.221 --> 14:15.989
Name's Albert Solomon,

14:15.989 --> 14:18.325
veteran of the Army
Quartermaster Corps.

14:18.325 --> 14:21.995
I'm here to get my grandson
Adam a second chance.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.897
Would you do that
for a veteran?

14:23.897 --> 14:26.333
Sir, while I appreciate
your service,

14:26.333 --> 14:27.500
grades are non-negotiable.

14:27.500 --> 14:31.104
I think you'll change that
policy when you hear me out.

14:31.104 --> 14:35.208
Also, I don't remember
this jacket being so hot.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.543
Would you mind if I...

14:36.543 --> 14:38.411
Please, by all means.

14:38.411 --> 14:41.381
Ah, that's better.
Where was I?

14:41.381 --> 14:43.583
You're here to defend Adam,
even though he plagiarized

14:43.583 --> 14:45.385
the greatest show
in television history.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.420
No. I... I told him
those stories

14:47.420 --> 14:49.456
so I could spend time
with him.

14:49.456 --> 14:53.026
Also, is this shirt snug?
It... It feels snug.

14:53.026 --> 14:53.860
It's incredibly snug.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.895
Would you mind if I...
Be my guest.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.165
Where was I again?

14:58.165 --> 15:00.133
You were saying you
misrepresented your life

15:00.133 --> 15:03.570
as Hogan's Heroes in order
to impress your grandchild.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.073
What's going on now?
It's the helmet.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.441
Damn strap is so tight
on my chin.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.510
You served this country, sir.
Just get comfortable.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.280
(GRUNTS) That's some
sweet relief.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.315
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna stop all this.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.150
I'm gonna let Adam
redo his project.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.486
But just know, he has to
really impress me this time.

15:19.486 --> 15:23.023
Thank you for showing me
the dignity that I deserve.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.057
At ease.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.192
ADULT ADAM:
Pops' mission was a success!

15:25.192 --> 15:27.527
Meanwhile, Erica had
successfully put some of

15:27.527 --> 15:29.296
her new life skills
to the test.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.331
Morning, Mom.
Fresh-brewed coffee?

15:31.331 --> 15:33.333
Yes, thanks, and what
the (BLEEP) is this?

15:33.333 --> 15:36.336
Oh, we just whipped up
a little breakfast of toast,
bacon,

15:36.336 --> 15:38.505
sausage, ham steak,
freshly squeezed juice,

15:38.505 --> 15:39.739
and eggy in the hole.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.208
I use
a melon baller now.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.410
Why would you make
eggy in the hole?

15:43.410 --> 15:45.678
I'm the one who makes
eggy in the hole.

15:45.678 --> 15:48.148
Not anymore.
We eggy our own holes now.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.417
Your reign of eggy-ing
our holes is over, woman.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.619
Dad told us all about
your little plan to
make us need you,

15:52.619 --> 15:55.022
but guess what,
we learned stuff.

15:55.022 --> 15:58.158
We can egg any hole, ball any
melon, fold any sheet,

15:58.158 --> 15:59.659
top or fitted.

16:01.494 --> 16:02.996
Murray,
how could you do this?

16:02.996 --> 16:05.198
Make our children
responsible adults?

16:05.198 --> 16:06.599
I don't know
what got into me!

16:06.599 --> 16:09.002
Face it. We know
basic life skills now.

16:09.002 --> 16:12.105
Your days of manipulating us
into needing you are done.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.506
Manipulating you?

16:13.506 --> 16:15.475
I have never done anything
so awful.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.110
You faked
a pelvis injury

16:17.110 --> 16:19.046
so I'd cook
Thanksgiving dinner with you.

16:19.046 --> 16:22.182
You tricked us into filling up
a swear jar with enough money

16:22.182 --> 16:25.085
so we could take a family trip
to Colonial Williamsburg.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.154
You forged Mother's Day
coupons from us

16:27.154 --> 16:28.555
to get unlimited snuggles.

16:28.555 --> 16:29.456
Okay!
I do it every week!

16:29.456 --> 16:31.524
What do you want from me?
To be normal.

16:31.524 --> 16:32.725
You know
I can't do that!

16:32.725 --> 16:35.395
Well, you're gonna have to,
'cause after all these years

16:35.395 --> 16:37.464
of tricking us
into staying close,

16:37.464 --> 16:39.399
all you've done
is drive us away.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.537
They're right, Bevy,
and you know it.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.406
Of course I know it.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.276
They've just grown up so fast,
Murray.

16:49.276 --> 16:51.811
I'm their mother.
I've given them everything!

16:51.811 --> 16:53.813
And it is so hard
to be reminded

16:53.813 --> 16:56.116
that your time with them
is over.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.818
It's not over.
It's just changing.

16:58.818 --> 17:01.188
And you just got to figure out
a way to change with it.

17:03.056 --> 17:05.258
I have returned
for my melon baller.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.526
Good day to you.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.595
Ouch.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.599
ADULT ADAM: After ripping off
Hogan's Heroes,

17:12.599 --> 17:14.567
Pops helped me get
one final shot

17:14.567 --> 17:16.569
to save my butt and my grade.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.838
Hey. I'm just gonna skip
the preamble and show you

17:18.838 --> 17:21.208
what really happened
to my grandfather in the war.

17:22.575 --> 17:25.578
It was October 8, 1942.

17:25.578 --> 17:29.616
I signed up for basic training
and was shipped off
to Alabama.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.184
The heat was brutal,

17:31.184 --> 17:33.753
and we lost a lot of good men
along the way.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.722
I'm sorry, Al.
I got to go.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.724
Damn it, Boxy!
Don't you leave me!

17:37.724 --> 17:40.693
I got no choice!
I tripped and hurt my foot.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.496
No!

17:43.496 --> 17:46.199
POPS: It was summer.
Our boat was headed
for Florida

17:46.199 --> 17:48.601
loaded with 1,000 crates
of pants.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.704
Problem was, no one knew
which were the small pants

17:51.704 --> 17:53.740
and which were
the large pants.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.808
It was up to me to make sure

17:55.808 --> 17:58.611
everyone got
the right size pants.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.680
Sir! These pants
are too short, sir!

18:01.348 --> 18:03.750
No!

18:03.750 --> 18:07.487
We docked at dawn, and by God,
we delivered those pants,

18:07.487 --> 18:10.890
which fit perfectly
on the bravest soldiers

18:10.890 --> 18:13.126
this world has ever known.

18:13.126 --> 18:16.163
ADAM: Turns out, heroes come
in all shapes and sizes.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.565
I know Pops didn't storm
the beach at Normandy,

18:18.565 --> 18:20.700
but he still put his life
on the line.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.669
And that's why he's my hero.

18:22.669 --> 18:25.405
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

18:27.207 --> 18:29.242
DOC: (SIGHS) Damn.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.144
That got me.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.446
My gramps was a cook
on a Navy barge

18:33.446 --> 18:34.781
that never left Hudson Bay.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.583
* I don't know
where I'm going
So I don't fail?

18:36.583 --> 18:39.152
Son, that was the best damn
term paper I've ever seen.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.920
And I suggest
you keep making more.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.390
ADULT ADAM: And I did,
thanks to Pops.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.558
Turns out,
every once in a while,

18:45.558 --> 18:47.694
we get so excited
to be around our family,

18:47.694 --> 18:50.263
we lose sight of doing
what's right.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.798
Whatcha doing?
You were right.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.467
* And I've made up my mind
I'm always trying to

18:54.467 --> 18:58.171
stop the kids from changing,
stop everything from changing.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.173
* I ain't wasting no more time
But now I realize
that's impossible.

19:00.173 --> 19:04.677
* But here I go again
It's time for me
to change, too.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.546
* Here I go again
So, the visit's over?

19:06.546 --> 19:07.880
I mean,
it just felt so fast.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.782
Well, we have a few minutes
right now.

19:09.782 --> 19:10.783
Let's make
the most of it.

19:10.783 --> 19:13.286
Kids, I need to talk to you.
Geoff, get out.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.554
You know,
I don't mind staying.

19:14.554 --> 19:17.357
Sometimes, I kind of feel like
I'm part of the family. Okay.

19:17.357 --> 19:20.427
Mom, don't even start.
I get enough lectures
at school.

19:20.427 --> 19:23.896
It's not a lecture.
It's an apology.

19:23.896 --> 19:26.933
I've done a few
questionable things

19:26.933 --> 19:29.236
to keep you kids close to me.
"A few"?

19:29.236 --> 19:31.571
I've done a ton
of questionable things!

19:31.571 --> 19:33.540
But no more.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.741
You kids are changing.

19:34.741 --> 19:37.977
There's... There's no reason
I can't, too.

19:37.977 --> 19:41.848
It's time for an evolution,
a Bevolution.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.251
That sounds expensive.
Oh, it will be.

19:44.251 --> 19:46.719
But it's something
I want to do.
What do you say?

19:46.719 --> 19:49.722
ADULT ADAM:
Sometimes, the toughest
decisions in life.

19:49.722 --> 19:52.325
end up giving us
the best results.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.294
I say,
it's really awesome.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.962
* And here I go again
on my own
And I'm proud of you.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.830
And we come to appreciate
our family

19:57.830 --> 19:59.031
for who they really are...

19:59.031 --> 20:00.032
* Going down the only road
I've ever known

20:00.032 --> 20:01.834
...and who they
help us become.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.671
Wow.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.839
No more going home for Mommy
to do your laundry?

20:06.839 --> 20:09.742
Nope. I'll just be
going home for her.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.911
And in the end,
it's not just the stories

20:11.911 --> 20:14.481
we tell each other
that are important.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.383
It's the people who tell them.

20:16.383 --> 20:17.950
* I ain't wasting
no more time *

20:17.950 --> 20:19.919
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

20:23.022 --> 20:24.491
ADAM: Ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.

20:24.491 --> 20:25.692
What do you want me
to do?

20:25.692 --> 20:27.660
My name is Albert...
Actor Albert...

20:27.660 --> 20:28.661
WOMAN:
Look at the camera.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.397
...actor
Albert S. Solomon.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.631
ADAM: (LAUGHING)
That's so depressing.

20:31.631 --> 20:32.732
Say it nicer.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.501
(LAUGHTER)

20:35.402 --> 20:36.736
Don't throw that!

20:36.736 --> 20:38.838
My name is
Albert S. Solomon.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.408
I am 80...

20:41.408 --> 20:44.377
(LAUGHTER)

20:44.377 --> 20:45.545
Do you want me
to lie to you?

20:45.545 --> 20:46.913
No, no, no.
That was good.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.551
Up next, from
the Von Thurston estate

20:51.551 --> 20:55.655
is this abstract
expressionist painting
of unknown provenance.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.390
The bidding starts
at $5,000.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.758
$30,000!

20:58.758 --> 21:00.793
I have $30,000.
Whoa.
Pump the brakes, kiddo.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.662
Don't worry. The whole point
is to force these dopes

21:02.662 --> 21:04.364
to pay double
for this ridiculous art.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.533
I have $30,000 going once.

21:06.533 --> 21:07.934
I'm pretty sure that guy
raised his hand.

21:07.934 --> 21:08.868
No.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.337
No? You sure?

21:10.337 --> 21:12.805
I am sure.
I have $30,000 going twice.

21:12.805 --> 21:13.873
Come on, people!

21:13.873 --> 21:16.409
Look at that beautifully
rendered depiction of...

21:16.409 --> 21:18.345
Despair or joy
or horses.

21:18.345 --> 21:20.713
I... Who knows what it is,
but just buy it, people!

21:20.713 --> 21:24.717
Sold to Mr. Skywalker
and his associate, Dr. Zaius.

21:24.717 --> 21:27.454
Run, Adam.
Run and don't look back.
