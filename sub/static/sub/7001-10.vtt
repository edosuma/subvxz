01:13.050 --> 01:16.000
- Tim, wait. The sink is still clogged.
- I'll get to it in a minute.

01:16.090 --> 01:19.480
Come on out here.
I want you to see this thing.

01:19.570 --> 01:23.719
Well, what do you think?
This is the frame to a '34 ford Roadster.

01:23.810 --> 01:28.879
- The beginning of my dream hot rod.
- Dad, this thing's awesome.

01:28.969 --> 01:31.600
What's the big deal?
It doesn't even have an engine.

01:31.689 --> 01:33.080
Well, not yet.
I've got to build it.

01:33.169 --> 01:36.560
I think I'm going to use a small block
Chevy 350, stainless steel headers,

01:36.649 --> 01:42.399
chrome valves, pink rods, dual exhaust,
glass… Honey, what do you think?

01:43.810 --> 01:46.919
- Well, you finally got your convertible.
- Honey.

01:47.490 --> 01:49.869
Dad, am I going to be able to help you
work on this thing?

01:49.969 --> 01:51.679
- You bet.
- No, no. Brad…

01:51.770 --> 01:54.719
- Honey, you have to finish your homework.
- Oh, man.

01:54.810 --> 01:55.919
No "oh, mans". Do as she says.

01:56.010 --> 01:57.959
When you finish your homework.
then you can help me.

01:58.050 --> 01:59.439
- All right.
- Hey. Randy!

01:59.570 --> 02:01.679
- You finish your homework?
- Yeah.

02:01.770 --> 02:04.399
- You want to help?
- No.

02:05.409 --> 02:10.800
- Where did I go wrong with him?
- Don't worry about it. He's not yours.

02:16.369 --> 02:19.199
Well? Pretty cool, huh?

02:19.290 --> 02:22.600
Not much pitting. It's really
true and square, a little bit of rust.

02:22.689 --> 02:27.040
I went through every junkyard in Detroit
to find this. I paid practically nothing.

02:27.129 --> 02:29.080
You paid too much.

02:29.609 --> 02:31.280
- You don't. Honey, honey…
- Tim, you promised me…

02:31.369 --> 02:32.719
- This is a dream, this is a dream…
- You were gonna help me finish…

02:32.850 --> 02:35.359
…of mine since I was a kid.
Since I was a kid.

02:35.449 --> 02:39.639
I wanted a hot rod. Not a pro street rod.
nothing fancy, just a driver, man.

02:39.730 --> 02:43.399
When I get done, every bolt.
every weld, every detail

02:43.490 --> 02:46.439
is going to be built by these hands.
I'll be part of it, it'll be part of me.

02:46.530 --> 02:51.389
Honey. I do understand. Now. I want you
to come in and be part of our sink.

02:51.490 --> 02:54.119
I know it seems like
a rusted piece of junk.

02:54.209 --> 03:00.800
- Tim, it is a rusted piece of junk.
- To you. But to me, it looks like this.

03:04.969 --> 03:08.199
You actually see a car in that picture?

03:08.290 --> 03:10.590
- It's under Rita.
- Rita!

03:10.689 --> 03:13.600
She's the pro stock girl. They just
use her to make the car look good.

03:13.689 --> 03:17.719
And a darn fine job she's doing, too.

03:18.449 --> 03:20.719
Boy, isn't she ever.

03:20.810 --> 03:22.840
Boy, you know what I've got to do
is get the rust oﬀ this first.

03:22.929 --> 03:25.719
Sandblast would be expensive.
I'm going to try…

03:25.810 --> 03:28.800
- What are you doing with those?
- I'm going to unplug the sink.

03:28.889 --> 03:31.679
You can't unplug the sink
with needle nose pliers.

03:31.770 --> 03:37.040
I'm going to use the pliers
to get your screwdriver out of the drain.

03:38.609 --> 03:42.760
- Why is my screwdriver in the drain?
- I used it to unclog the sink.

03:42.850 --> 03:44.480
What?!

03:45.409 --> 03:47.439
You used a screwdriver?

03:47.530 --> 03:53.790
Yeah, well. I tried the plunger and it didn't
work, so I decided I should stab the guck.

03:56.129 --> 03:59.199
"Stab the guck"
with a Binford nickel-plated screwdriver?

03:59.290 --> 04:00.760
Yeah.

04:00.850 --> 04:07.959
Why don't you just go back to your hot rod
and let me take care of this?

04:08.050 --> 04:12.199
Right. Next thing you know you'll be
jamming my band saw down there.

04:12.290 --> 04:15.040
I might.
What's a band saw?

04:15.129 --> 04:18.079
Never mind.
I'll get my tools, drain, sink, screwdriver…

04:18.168 --> 04:20.119
- Son of a gun!
- Are you guys fighting?

04:20.209 --> 04:22.199
- Yes!
- No.

04:22.290 --> 04:24.159
Honey, it's real noisy down here.

04:24.250 --> 04:29.320
Why don't you just go upstairs
and finish your homework up there?

04:30.449 --> 04:34.879
Jill, come over here. I'm going to teach you
some basic plumbing.

04:34.969 --> 04:38.510
No, no, no. Tim.
You are not teaching.

04:38.649 --> 04:43.000
Look, you've got to learn basic plumbing.
What would happen if I died?

04:43.090 --> 04:46.240
And all the plumbers are dead?

04:50.090 --> 04:51.119
Yes,

04:51.209 --> 04:54.240
Tim, every time you try to
teach me anything.

04:54.330 --> 04:58.199
- you get impatient and you end up yelling.
- When was the last time I yelled at you?

04:58.290 --> 05:00.719
When you showed me how to
assemble the patio furniture.

05:00.810 --> 05:02.359
You snapped the heads right oﬀ the bolts.

05:02.449 --> 05:05.119
You told me to turn the wrench
as hard as I could.

05:05.209 --> 05:09.639
Most people would stop turning
when the wood starts cracking.

05:09.730 --> 05:12.840
Well. I would've heard the wood cracking
if you hadn't been yelling.

05:12.929 --> 05:14.480
- I wasn't yelling…
- You were yelling!

05:26.209 --> 05:31.000
Plumbing is very simple.
It's easy to learn if you just pay attention.

05:31.090 --> 05:35.399
- If I pay attention, will you be patient?
- And you won't ask any stupid questions?

05:35.490 --> 05:37.560
- fine.
- fine.

05:37.649 --> 05:41.959
OK, first thing we want to do
is remove the trap.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.320
The curved thingy?

05:45.530 --> 05:48.840
Well, that would be the technical term.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.959
To remove the trap.
we have to have the proper tool.

05:53.090 --> 05:55.550
for that, we use the trusty monkey wrench.

05:55.649 --> 05:57.600
You'll notice one side is fixed.
it's serrated on both sides…

05:57.689 --> 05:59.639
Why do they call it a monkey wrench?

05:59.730 --> 06:05.399
They call it a monkey wrench
because even a monkey can use it.

06:06.810 --> 06:09.600
Thank you. Cheetah.

06:11.369 --> 06:16.919
OK, now put the wrench on the coupling
at the end of the trap.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.570
- You mean this thing here?
- No, no, no.

06:19.649 --> 06:22.600
That connects the elbow
to the drain pipe and the flange.

06:22.689 --> 06:25.840
"flange"? Who comes up
with all these stupid names?

06:25.929 --> 06:29.080
I'm sorry, honey. It's the little silvery thingy
at the bottom, right down in…

06:29.169 --> 06:30.959
You don't have to be sarcastic, you know.

06:31.050 --> 06:33.119
You're using all these technical terms.

06:33.209 --> 06:36.000
- This is practically baby talk.
- Oh, oh, excuse me.

06:36.090 --> 06:41.439
I guess I forgot that Mark's first three words
were "Mommy". "Daddy" and "flange".

06:41.530 --> 06:43.040
- Give me the wrench. I'll do it.
- fine, you do it.

06:43.129 --> 06:44.879
OK, fine. I will.

06:44.969 --> 06:48.800
At least I know what I'm doing.
Ow!

06:48.889 --> 06:53.199
Is that the coupling or the flange?

06:56.050 --> 06:58.609
That sink's working pretty good, isn't it?

06:58.689 --> 07:02.879
- Uh-huh.
- Water's running freely, no clogs.

07:04.050 --> 07:07.560
Things got kind of heated
between us today, didn't they?

07:07.649 --> 07:10.959
- Yeah, they did.
- Well. I'd like to clear the air.

07:11.050 --> 07:13.919
I apologize, and I'm sorry.

07:15.609 --> 07:18.320
Thank you. Apology accepted.

07:26.609 --> 07:29.959
- And you?
- And me what?

07:30.050 --> 07:33.320
- Don't you want to apologize to me?
- for what?

07:33.409 --> 07:38.159
- for yelling at me.
- But I didn't yell at you. You yelled at me.

07:38.250 --> 07:41.869
That's because you dropped a screwdriver
down the sink.

07:41.969 --> 07:44.679
I don't think you realize
that I worked two hours on this sink.

07:44.770 --> 07:47.719
But I worked two hours on the sink
before you did.

07:47.810 --> 07:50.719
Worked?
You just threw tools down there.

07:50.810 --> 07:53.520
I was trying to fix it.

07:53.609 --> 07:56.199
If you wanted to fix it.
you should learn how to do it properly.

07:56.290 --> 07:57.679
Well, why should I learn how to do it

07:57.810 --> 08:01.040
when you already know how to
do it properly?

08:01.129 --> 08:02.800
Honey. I thought we share
responsibilities here.

08:02.889 --> 08:05.639
- We do.
- Well. I learned how to do the laundry.

08:05.730 --> 08:07.879
Separate the colors.
put the fabric softener in…

08:07.969 --> 08:13.639
No, wait, wait. Wait a minute. When was
the last time that you did the laundry. Tim?

08:13.730 --> 08:16.679
You know, that's…
this isn't the point.

08:16.770 --> 08:19.639
The point is. I learned how to do it.

08:19.730 --> 08:21.520
I don't see you out there
changing spark plugs.

08:21.609 --> 08:23.840
Do you want me to go out
and change the spark plugs?

08:23.929 --> 08:28.000
- You don't know how to do it.
- That's why I don't do it.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.359
- Hey, where're you going?
- I'm leaving.

08:29.449 --> 08:30.840
I'm not done talking yet.

08:30.929 --> 08:35.080
Well, it's not my fault that you never
learned how to finish a conversation.

08:38.649 --> 08:41.320
Now that we've finished the construction
of our trestle table.

08:41.409 --> 08:42.799
Let's begin the finish and sanding.

08:42.889 --> 08:45.320
for that. I'm going to discuss
mo diﬀerent kinds of sanders.

08:45.409 --> 08:49.280
Your belt sander, which is very powerful
and perfect for the rough sanding.

08:49.369 --> 08:53.240
and your orbital, or vibrating sander.
which is smaller

08:53.330 --> 08:57.439
and perfect for putting in your pocket.
Right. Al?

09:02.290 --> 09:05.119
I wouldn't know. Tim.

09:05.209 --> 09:06.520
I am kidding about that.
I am kidding.

09:06.609 --> 09:11.469
Never, ever put electrical devices
in your pants.

09:11.570 --> 09:16.000
All right, before we get going here. I'd like
to ask you fellas a few questions if I could.

09:16.090 --> 09:19.790
It is the '90s, and women expect us to help
a little bit around the house, don't they?

09:19.889 --> 09:22.639
- Maybe we should. Should we?
- Yeah.

09:22.730 --> 09:26.480
Hey, come on. You know we should
help around the house, right?

09:26.570 --> 09:29.760
Yeah, you know the problem is.
women want us to help with their work.

09:29.850 --> 09:31.800
but do they help with our work?
No!

09:31.889 --> 09:35.919
They expect us to do the laundry.
clean the oven, mop the floor, huh, right?

09:36.010 --> 09:38.199
Do you ever see her out there
gapping and changing a spark plug?

09:38.290 --> 09:40.240
No! Unclogging a drain?

09:40.330 --> 09:44.600
No! Their excuse is.
"Well, you know about this stuﬀ. I don't."

09:44.689 --> 09:47.679
"I could break a nail."

09:48.530 --> 09:51.159
This is an excuse, women.
and you're not the type to have excuses.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.810
You need to be taught.
And I don't think you're stupid

09:53.889 --> 09:57.159
just because you don't know anything.

09:57.810 --> 09:59.800
No, that didn't come out right.

09:59.889 --> 10:02.320
I don't want to get any cards and letters
over that, right, Al?

10:02.409 --> 10:06.919
That's Tim Taylor, care of Tool Time.
PO Box 327…

10:07.010 --> 10:09.719
Al, I think they know the address.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.080
Well, this is gonna be diﬀerent
because on next week's show.

10:12.169 --> 10:16.240
I've invited a group of women in, and
I'm going to teach them basic home repair

10:16.330 --> 10:19.869
using a simple language
even women can understand.

10:19.969 --> 10:24.560
- PO Box 32733…
- No. I didn't mean to give the impression

10:24.689 --> 10:26.760
that women are simple.
No, that's not what I mean.

10:26.850 --> 10:29.679
I mean, it's not a woman's fault
that they grew up spending half their time

10:29.770 --> 10:32.279
playing with plastic ovens and dolls.
and don't know a thing about tools.

10:32.369 --> 10:33.350
Right. Al?

10:39.130 --> 10:41.560
All right, we're going to finish
sanding that table now.

10:41.650 --> 10:43.480
We've got our belt attached
with a rough grip.

10:43.569 --> 10:45.520
And we want to plug the thing in now.

10:45.610 --> 10:48.480
Of course, you want to be sure the trigger
switch is not locked in the "on" position.

10:48.569 --> 10:50.869
Any idiot knows that. Al.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.639
All right, good.

11:09.730 --> 11:11.719
Thanks a lot. Dad.
That was fun.

11:11.810 --> 11:14.080
- You did a good job.
- Thanks.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.159
Are you ready for that test today?

11:16.250 --> 11:19.000
- I guess so.
- What do you mean you guess so?

11:19.089 --> 11:24.400
It's not fair. I study mice as hard
as Randy does - he gets As and I get Cs.

11:24.489 --> 11:27.360
Certain things he does better.
certain things you do better.

11:27.449 --> 11:30.560
- You kick his butt in basketball, don't you?
- Yeah.

11:30.650 --> 11:34.000
To me it's the eﬀort you put into things.
not just the grade that counts.

11:34.130 --> 11:38.159
- So it's OK if I flunk?
- No.

11:38.250 --> 11:39.759
I don't want you living here when you're 25.

11:39.850 --> 11:42.480
"Dad, you wanna shave together
or somethin'? Come on."

11:42.569 --> 11:44.279
Dad…

11:44.369 --> 11:46.279
I'm kidding.
You're gonna do fine on that test.

11:46.369 --> 11:48.960
- School bus is here!
- So long. Dad.

11:49.290 --> 11:50.880
- Good luck on your test, honey.
- Bye. Mom.

11:50.969 --> 11:52.080
Bye-bye.

11:55.130 --> 11:57.509
I'll get that.

11:58.049 --> 12:01.440
Hello. Yeah, it's me.

12:01.529 --> 12:04.880
What do you mean we don't have
any women in the audience today?

12:04.969 --> 12:06.960
Two?

12:07.049 --> 12:10.040
Well, didn't you put up the address
on the screen?

12:10.130 --> 12:12.400
Hate mail?

12:16.170 --> 12:18.360
We gotta have women in that audience.

12:18.449 --> 12:20.880
I don't care how you do it.
I need a full audience of women.

12:20.969 --> 12:23.199
Thanks. Lisa.

12:23.290 --> 12:24.960
- Problem?
- Huh?

12:25.049 --> 12:26.960
Ah, just a minor setback.

12:27.049 --> 12:30.719
I didn't get the response from
the female viewers I thought I would.

12:30.810 --> 12:37.069
Maybe cos they're all home playing
with their dolls and plastic ovens.

12:37.170 --> 12:38.360
I'm going down to the studio.

12:38.489 --> 12:42.239
I, for one, am not going to miss
this very special Tool Time.

12:42.330 --> 12:46.799
You don't have 40 friends
you can bring with you, do you?

12:51.730 --> 12:53.679
Hey. Wilson.

12:53.770 --> 12:56.330
Wilson.
Wilson, you all right?

12:56.409 --> 12:59.719
- Just fine, neighbor.
- Agh!

12:59.810 --> 13:03.080
I see you've met my scarecrow - Oliver.

13:05.009 --> 13:09.560
I always try to flameproof him
before I put him away for winter.

13:09.690 --> 13:12.480
- Wilson. I've got a little problem.
- Mm-hmm.

13:12.569 --> 13:16.520
I've gotta teach a bunch of women some
home repair tips today on Tool Time.

13:16.610 --> 13:19.319
Uh-huh.
And these women worry you?

13:19.409 --> 13:22.000
Well, if they're anything like Jill, they do.

13:22.089 --> 13:25.440
We got into this big argument when I
tried to teach her some basic plumbing.

13:25.529 --> 13:26.880
Mm-hmm.

13:26.969 --> 13:30.670
Just simple stuﬀ, you know -
coupling, flange, the trap.

13:30.770 --> 13:34.440
Well. Tim. I think the problem
might be your metamessage.

13:34.529 --> 13:37.040
That would be "message" with "meta"
on the front of it.

13:37.130 --> 13:38.350
Yes, sirree Bob.

13:38.449 --> 13:42.600
Two Ms, three Es, two As, two Ss.
T and a lonely little G.

13:42.690 --> 13:46.960
You have an awful lot of spare time,
don't you, Wilson?

13:48.449 --> 13:51.040
You see, Tim, when men teach women,
they tend to use

13:51.130 --> 13:55.000
complicated, technical terms
to make themselves appear superior.

13:55.089 --> 13:57.549
Thus saying to the woman
"you are inferior".

13:57.650 --> 14:03.080
That's what I'll do on Tool Time today.
No metamessages, keep it simple.

14:07.610 --> 14:12.199
Hi, everybody, and welcome to this special
edition, "The Ladies of Tool Time".

14:18.089 --> 14:21.630
Hey! Normally we get the show going
with a big hearty grunt

14:21.730 --> 14:24.719
to get those lungs open.
Come on, everybody.

14:32.449 --> 14:33.799
Where is Irma?

14:33.889 --> 14:35.279
Yeah.

14:35.369 --> 14:39.150
I drove all the way from Langton
to see Cooking with Irma.

14:39.250 --> 14:43.400
Well, settle down for a minute.
We played a little trick on you.

14:43.489 --> 14:45.159
We took the normal Tool Time audience

14:45.250 --> 14:47.279
and they're over watching
Cooking with Irma.

14:47.369 --> 14:49.929
and we brought you ladies in here
for a little treat.

14:50.009 --> 14:55.839
Hey. I don't care about no tools.
I came down here to learn to cook.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.119
I'm confused.

14:58.210 --> 15:01.830
You mean Irma's not going to show us
how to make crab curry?

15:01.929 --> 15:04.880
No. Wha-what's going to happen…
I'm gonna show you

15:04.969 --> 15:08.670
how to repair three very typical
household problems.

15:08.770 --> 15:10.839
Oh, a clogged sink.

15:10.929 --> 15:13.719
a bad electrical connection.
the running toilet.

15:13.810 --> 15:16.719
Oh, my God.

15:17.730 --> 15:20.029
Hey, you get to keep those hats.

15:20.130 --> 15:22.639
Those hats are yours.

15:22.730 --> 15:25.719
Hey, there's the spirit.

15:25.810 --> 15:28.600
Oh, we need three volunteers right away.

15:28.690 --> 15:31.360
- I'll volunteer.
- OK.

15:32.850 --> 15:37.400
You had your hand up. Let's get
her down with some applause here.

15:37.529 --> 15:40.679
OK, we need one more volunteer.

15:40.770 --> 15:42.159
You had your hand up.
didn't you, ma'am?

15:42.250 --> 15:43.679
No. I didn't.

15:43.770 --> 15:46.560
Oh, come on. You look like the kind
of woman that wants to learn this stuﬀ.

15:46.650 --> 15:49.880
Give her a round of applause.
Get her out here - come on!

15:55.130 --> 15:59.040
Well, we've got our three volunteers.
What do you say we meet our helpers?

15:59.130 --> 16:02.480
- Your name?
- My name is Greta Post.

16:03.130 --> 16:07.239
- OK. Greta, are you married?
- No. I'm still looking for Mr Right.

16:14.080 --> 16:17.750
How do you feel about beards?

16:17.840 --> 16:19.990
Oh. I like them.

16:21.399 --> 16:23.549
Ma'am, your name?

16:24.480 --> 16:26.779
Rita.

16:26.879 --> 16:30.500
You look pretty happy.
You must be happily married.

16:30.600 --> 16:34.220
Yes, but I'm kind of planning a divorce.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.190
- Excuse me, ma'am, your name?
- Judith Potter.

16:38.279 --> 16:40.110
Hello. Judith Potter.
Are you married?

16:40.200 --> 16:43.870
22 years to the same slug.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.509
22 years.

16:46.600 --> 16:50.429
And what a happy time
that must've been.

16:50.519 --> 16:52.629
Let's start with you. Greta.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.789
Step over to the sink here.

16:54.879 --> 17:00.870
Your typical clog. Al, could we have
a little breathing room in here, please?

17:00.960 --> 17:03.340
Excuse me.

17:10.680 --> 17:14.348
Want me to get you a magazine
or something. Al?

17:17.118 --> 17:20.740
This is your typical sink clog.
with yucky hair and grease.

17:20.839 --> 17:24.230
and I want to thank the crew of Tool Time
for providing all that hair and grease.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.269
Thanks, guys.

17:26.358 --> 17:30.190
- All right.
- Am I gonna have to touch it?

17:30.279 --> 17:32.950
Well, yeah, to get it out of there.
you have to yank it out of there.

17:33.759 --> 17:36.349
Would you like me to
get you some gloves. Greta?

17:36.440 --> 17:40.059
- Oh, could you. Al?
- Right away.

17:42.119 --> 17:48.029
Why don't you get that picnic basket and
a bottle of wine while you're back there?

17:48.119 --> 17:52.950
While we're waiting for Al, maybe Judith
can help me work on this running toilet.

17:53.039 --> 17:56.390
I know it probably sounds complicated.
but it's not.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.069
Take the lid oﬀ.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.549
You follow the rod 'till you get this
little puﬀy ball right on the end here…

18:01.640 --> 18:04.349
- Puﬀy ball?
- Right. On the end…

18:05.839 --> 18:10.509
You mean the float arm
that's attached to the ball cock?

18:13.559 --> 18:16.150
- I was trying to make it simple.
- You saying I'm simple?

18:16.240 --> 18:19.390
No. No. I'm trying to use a language
we would all understand.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.710
Then you want to take your flat-tip
screwdriver - make your adjustment.

18:22.839 --> 18:24.470
- You don't need all that.
- The proper way to do it…

18:24.559 --> 18:26.069
- You don't need all that.
- You gotta…

18:26.160 --> 18:30.829
If the toilet is running.
you just grab the rod…

18:30.920 --> 18:34.069
- and bend it.
- Ouch!

18:34.680 --> 18:38.670
Looks like that's not the first rod
you've bent.

18:40.359 --> 18:43.190
Whoo-hoo, you've got that right.

18:44.759 --> 18:47.589
Hey, we can't wait around for
our husbands to get oﬀ the couch

18:47.680 --> 18:49.349
and do something useful, can we?

18:49.440 --> 18:52.789
Hey, you doggone right!
I know it can't happen.

18:52.880 --> 18:59.109
Well. Looks like Greta's got those gloves.
Let's check on that clog, shall we?

19:01.319 --> 19:03.990
- Want to handle that clog?
- I can't do this.

19:04.079 --> 19:06.589
- Oh, sure you can. Greta.
- Would you like to sit down and rest?

19:06.680 --> 19:08.829
What?!

19:08.920 --> 19:11.190
Well. I think I would.

19:12.960 --> 19:15.150
Can I get you a soda?

19:15.240 --> 19:16.670
Hey, uh…

19:16.759 --> 19:19.950
You want me to fix the sink?

19:20.039 --> 19:24.869
No, Judith, you've done a good job.
You bent that rod perfectly, you know?

19:24.960 --> 19:28.579
Give her a big round of applause.
everybody.

19:32.799 --> 19:34.549
OK.

19:34.640 --> 19:38.069
Well. Rita, how would you like to
help me unclog this sink?

19:38.160 --> 19:40.509
No. I don't think it's a good idea.

19:40.599 --> 19:44.869
My husband always yells at me a lot
when he tries to teach me something.

19:44.960 --> 19:49.630
That's probably because he used
metamessages.

19:49.720 --> 19:54.150
That's making things sound more
complicated than they are.

19:54.240 --> 19:57.269
Using technical jargon
to make women feel inferior.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.269
And I'm sure he didn't know
he was doing that

19:59.400 --> 20:03.099
and I'm sure he's real sorry
that he did that.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.990
Well,

20:05.079 --> 20:07.150
I wouldn't mind learning
if my husband were as patient

20:07.240 --> 20:11.470
and understanding as you are.
Although, I must say,

20:11.559 --> 20:15.339
he is your biggest fan.

20:19.279 --> 20:24.220
- Brad, how did that test go today?
- I tried my best.

20:24.319 --> 20:27.710
Is the grade at least within
the first four letters of the alphabet?

20:27.799 --> 20:30.789
Come on. Brad. How did you do?

20:30.880 --> 20:33.230
I was hoping to get a C, but I didn't.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.349
- That's all right.
- Ah.

20:35.920 --> 20:39.349
- I got a C plus!
- All right!

20:39.440 --> 20:41.819
- Good work.
- Eﬀort, buddy. The eﬀort.

20:41.920 --> 20:45.950
- Nice going, jerk ball.
- Thanks a lot, doof.

20:46.039 --> 20:47.710
Get me a soda, will ya?

20:47.799 --> 20:50.990
Dad, are we going to be able to work
on the hot rod?

20:51.079 --> 20:53.109
Yeah. But you've got to go change
your clothes, all right?

20:53.200 --> 20:55.029
All right.

20:55.119 --> 20:59.910
So, um… Tim.
you were a pretty good teacher today.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.190
- Well, you were my best student.
- I was your only student.

21:04.279 --> 21:09.990
But I really did learn something.
so I decided to give you something.

21:10.079 --> 21:11.630
- Yeah?
- I know how much

21:11.720 --> 21:13.750
you like that picture of the hot rod.

21:13.839 --> 21:15.390
The picture in the magazine
with Rita in it?

21:15.480 --> 21:16.589
- Yeah.
- Really?

21:16.680 --> 21:19.349
- So I had it blown up.
- What a sport.

21:23.759 --> 21:26.470
Well. looky there.
There's a car in that picture.

21:26.559 --> 21:28.829
Yeah!

21:40.079 --> 21:42.349
Pink slips, pal.

21:43.680 --> 21:46.509
Nine grand, whole shot.

21:49.759 --> 21:52.509
Ah! Missed a shift.

21:57.559 --> 22:00.670
What are you doing?

22:02.200 --> 22:04.910
Just checkin' out that frame, honey.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.190
You are not.
You're pretending to drive.

22:09.279 --> 22:10.670
Well, maybe I was.

22:10.759 --> 22:13.430
- Is there room for mo in there?
- Wanna go for a spin?

22:13.519 --> 22:16.029
Love to.

22:18.119 --> 22:21.150
- All-leather Recaros.
- Ooh.

22:21.279 --> 22:22.420
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

22:22.519 --> 22:24.819
Watch the paint.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.059
Unlock my door, please.

22:32.599 --> 22:35.059
High output ignition system.

22:40.839 --> 22:43.430
- Pretty nice, huh?
- Very nice.
