WEBVTT

00:07.292 --> 00:09.259
How's it look?

00:09.293 --> 00:10.987
-Everything you want?
-Yeah.

00:11.062 --> 00:12.722
Around the world in 80 days.

00:12.763 --> 00:13.854
First class. Five-star.

00:13.898 --> 00:14.955
You're staying at some

00:14.999 --> 00:16.727
of the most magnificent
hotels in the world,

00:16.766 --> 00:17.993
and when you're in Florence,

00:18.034 --> 00:20.331
there's a restaurant
called Enoteca Pincchiori.

00:20.370 --> 00:21.768
l'll get the phone
number for you.

00:21.805 --> 00:23.328
lt's unbelievably romantic.

00:23.373 --> 00:25.397
Thanks, l'll have to try that.

00:25.441 --> 00:26.998
So, will you
and your traveling companion

00:27.042 --> 00:28.338
be needing two rooms or one?

00:28.377 --> 00:29.434
One.

00:29.478 --> 00:30.876
Two beds or one?

00:30.913 --> 00:32.106
One.

00:32.147 --> 00:34.410
And the name of your companion?

00:34.449 --> 00:36.245
Miss Kelly Taylor.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074

01:45.545 --> 01:47.944
No, l know, the
meetings last week.

01:47.981 --> 01:49.379
Well, when did
all this come down?

01:49.415 --> 01:50.745
About a month ago.

01:50.782 --> 01:53.011
We really didn't see any reason
to tell you about it.

01:53.051 --> 01:54.210
You could have
said something.

01:54.253 --> 01:58.052
Well, Jim, it wasn't
that important.

02:00.057 --> 02:01.421
Yeah, this is so unexpected.

02:01.459 --> 02:02.948
l...

02:03.027 --> 02:04.960
What's going on with Dad?

02:04.996 --> 02:06.326
Bender's on the phone.

02:06.364 --> 02:07.728
-Bender?
-Mm-hmm.

02:07.764 --> 02:08.957
Bender never calls him at home.

02:08.999 --> 02:10.625
l know. He must've got word

02:10.667 --> 02:11.928
that your father's
threatening to quit.

02:11.968 --> 02:13.832
Do you think he's really
gonna go through with it?

02:13.870 --> 02:15.268
Oh, he might.

02:15.305 --> 02:17.636
After 15 years, he deserves to
be treated with some respect.

02:17.673 --> 02:20.300
l mean, imagine what it's like
to get shut out of meetings,

02:20.342 --> 02:22.172
to be snubbed by people
you've been working with

02:22.211 --> 02:23.643
your entire professional life.

02:23.679 --> 02:26.977
l don't have to imagine it,
Mom. l'm living it.

02:27.015 --> 02:29.312
l was supposed to have a meeting
with the chancellor today.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.509
He blew me off.

02:30.552 --> 02:32.314
l'm sure he was just busy,
honey.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.649
Yeah...
You know, it's funny.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.586
People used to call me
the chancellor's lackey.

02:35.622 --> 02:37.646
Now he can't seem
to find the time for me.

02:37.691 --> 02:38.987
Oh, l'm sorry, honey.

02:39.026 --> 02:41.425
l know that losing the
election was tough.

02:41.460 --> 02:42.653
Yeah. l hate to admit it.

02:42.695 --> 02:45.162
lt's a little tougher
than l thought it would be.

02:46.399 --> 02:48.263
You'd better sit down.

02:48.301 --> 02:49.995
We are sitting down.

02:50.035 --> 02:55.870
Yeah, yeah. Then...
l'd better sit down.

02:55.907 --> 02:58.204
Well, what's going on?

02:58.243 --> 02:59.539
Well...

02:59.577 --> 03:01.942
the company wouldn't
accept my resignation.

03:01.979 --> 03:03.240
ls that good or bad?

03:03.280 --> 03:05.179
The reason they kept me
in the dark all this time?

03:05.216 --> 03:08.742
They've been planning to offer
me a substantial promotion.

03:08.785 --> 03:11.514
Oh, honey, well, that,
that's wonderful.

03:11.554 --> 03:13.180
Yeah. And a raise
that would put me

03:13.223 --> 03:14.416
about two and a half times

03:14.457 --> 03:15.855
my present salary.

03:15.891 --> 03:16.822
Jim!

03:16.858 --> 03:18.449
-There is a catch.
-They want us

03:18.493 --> 03:19.959
to move back to Minnesota.

03:19.995 --> 03:22.087
Mmm... Not Minnesota.

03:24.166 --> 03:25.689
Hong Kong.

03:42.214 --> 03:45.944
Whoo-ooh-ooh-ooh!

03:58.962 --> 04:00.519
Hey. How am l doing?

04:00.564 --> 04:02.053
Poetry in motion.

04:02.099 --> 04:03.463
l have a little control problem.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.693
Whoa!

04:06.903 --> 04:08.961
So do l.

04:13.142 --> 04:14.608
Mmm.

04:14.644 --> 04:17.942
l think l've been
swept off my feet.

04:17.978 --> 04:19.605
You have.

04:19.648 --> 04:21.945
What is this?

04:21.983 --> 04:23.313
Open it.

04:27.655 --> 04:29.622
Are you serious?

04:29.657 --> 04:31.385
Yeah. We'll leave
right after your exams.

04:31.425 --> 04:32.618
Just pack really light.

04:32.659 --> 04:34.285
We'll get anything
you need on the road.

04:34.327 --> 04:36.385
Clothes in France...

04:36.429 --> 04:38.055
Pearls in China...

04:38.097 --> 04:39.825
We'll go to Australia,
get you a boomerang.

04:39.866 --> 04:42.629
Dylan, l can't
just leave town.

04:42.668 --> 04:44.965
l have responsibilities.

04:45.003 --> 04:46.492
What responsibilities?

04:46.538 --> 04:47.697
School.

04:47.739 --> 04:48.830
School's out.

04:48.874 --> 04:50.170
l have a modeling contract.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.606
You get better looking
every day. They'll wait.

04:52.643 --> 04:54.610
What about my family
and friends?

04:54.645 --> 04:55.736
What about Brandon?

04:55.780 --> 04:56.871
Right?

04:56.914 --> 05:00.178
Look, you may have
traveled back in time

05:00.216 --> 05:03.241
and found me as your soul mate,
but l haven't.

05:03.286 --> 05:04.582
All l know is this life,

05:04.621 --> 05:07.111
and in this life,
l'm with Brandon,

05:07.156 --> 05:09.589
and as l recall, the last
time you and l traveled

05:09.625 --> 05:11.285
anywhere together,
we fought the whole time.

05:11.327 --> 05:14.261
So, you stay with Brandon
because you don't fight?

05:14.296 --> 05:15.455
Come on, Kel.

05:15.496 --> 05:17.258
When you're with me,
you fight with me

05:17.298 --> 05:18.730
because that's
when you're alive.

05:18.766 --> 05:21.256
We were together
in another life.

05:21.302 --> 05:23.132
lf we're gonna be
together in this one,

05:23.171 --> 05:25.900
the opportunity
is now. Right now.

05:25.939 --> 05:29.135
So come with me, unless
you want to stay here

05:29.176 --> 05:30.802
and roller-skate
with Uncle Minnesota.

05:30.844 --> 05:33.038
Dylan, don't do this.

05:33.079 --> 05:36.479
l wouldn't be here unless
l was absolutely sure

05:36.515 --> 05:38.948
that where you belong
is with me,

05:38.984 --> 05:41.110
together, wherever it is.

05:41.152 --> 05:43.312
l don't know what to say.

05:43.355 --> 05:44.616
So don't say anything.

05:44.656 --> 05:47.123
Just be ready when the car
comes to pick you up,

05:47.158 --> 05:49.125
and don't break anything

05:49.160 --> 05:51.354
out here rollerblading, okay,
'cause traveling on crutches

05:51.395 --> 05:53.157
is a bitch.

06:02.004 --> 06:03.436
Okay, boss.

06:03.473 --> 06:05.565
Movers... or car?

06:05.608 --> 06:06.733
Car.

06:06.776 --> 06:08.106
You know, at this rate,

06:08.143 --> 06:10.042
we're not gonna fit in the car.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.238
Oh, my God.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.213
lt's the final issue

06:14.249 --> 06:15.909
of the Blaze.

06:15.950 --> 06:17.780
Sweetheart, if you
stop to reminisce

06:17.818 --> 06:19.114
every time you pack something,

06:19.153 --> 06:20.744
we're not gonna get
out of here.

06:20.788 --> 06:21.776
l know, l know. lt's just, Jess,

06:21.822 --> 06:22.913
there's so many old memories,

06:22.957 --> 06:24.355
so many good friends.

06:24.391 --> 06:26.381
All right. That settles it.

06:26.426 --> 06:27.449
We're not going to Yale.

06:27.494 --> 06:28.687
We're staying here.

06:28.728 --> 06:30.922
Not on your life. Please.

06:30.964 --> 06:32.794
You know what? l haven't
gone through this drawer

06:32.831 --> 06:35.458
since l moved in and now l'm
just gonna throw it all away.

06:35.501 --> 06:36.865
So much for memories,
right?

06:36.902 --> 06:38.926
Jess, tell me where my
good-bye party is gonna be.

06:38.971 --> 06:40.938
-Nope. Nope, nope, nope, nope.
-Come on...

06:40.973 --> 06:42.940
l bet l can
get it out of you.

06:42.974 --> 06:44.463
l bet you can't, because
they wouldn't tell me,

06:44.509 --> 06:47.136
'cause they knew you'd
torture me until l broke.

06:47.178 --> 06:48.804
Well, l think
you'll tell me.

06:48.846 --> 06:50.107
l love torture.

06:50.147 --> 06:51.135
Torture?

06:51.181 --> 06:53.114
l love it when
you're rough.

06:53.150 --> 06:54.138
Hi, guys.

06:54.184 --> 06:55.810
-Hey, Steve.
-Hi, Steve.

06:55.852 --> 06:57.216
What're you doing?

06:57.254 --> 06:59.551
Well, we've almost
finished packing.

06:59.588 --> 07:01.054
Yeah. l can see that.

07:01.090 --> 07:05.617
So, uh, how's
my paper coming?

07:05.661 --> 07:07.890
Steve, l have an entire family
to move across the country,

07:07.929 --> 07:10.692
with a few finals of my own,
in case you forgot.

07:10.732 --> 07:13.564
No, l haven't forgot, but that
paper is due in three days,

07:13.601 --> 07:16.034
and that's my entire semester
grade for three courses.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.194
All right? l need that paper!

07:17.237 --> 07:18.294
Don't you think

07:18.338 --> 07:19.326
you should've thought
of that sooner,

07:19.373 --> 07:20.669
maybe written
the paper yourself?

07:20.707 --> 07:23.607
Yeah, l know. Procrastination
is my middle name,

07:23.644 --> 07:25.270
but think of it
this way, Andrea.

07:25.311 --> 07:28.143
This is the last time
you'll ever, ever

07:28.181 --> 07:30.546
-have to help me again.
-Steve,

07:30.583 --> 07:32.777
don't say it that way, okay?
l'm just gonna get sad.

07:32.818 --> 07:34.876
Sad enough to do the paper?

07:39.291 --> 07:40.848
All right, we will do the paper,

07:40.892 --> 07:42.085
Okay? We're gonna
clear off the table,

07:42.126 --> 07:43.319
and we'll do it right now.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.917
l... l can't.

07:44.962 --> 07:46.622
l have got a, a softball game.

07:46.664 --> 07:47.789
Softball?

07:47.832 --> 07:49.025
Yeah. We're in the
quarter finals.

07:49.066 --> 07:50.054
Wouldn't you know?

07:50.099 --> 07:51.087
They have me batting clean-up,

07:51.134 --> 07:52.327
and, uh... l tell you what.

07:52.368 --> 07:53.356
lf you start this paper,

07:53.403 --> 07:54.664
l'll swing by after the game

07:54.704 --> 07:55.863
and we'll finish together. Okay?

07:55.905 --> 07:57.769
Andrea, thanks. Thanks
a million. l love you.

07:57.807 --> 07:58.773
Steve! Steve!

07:58.807 --> 07:59.966
Come on. Steve!

08:05.881 --> 08:08.212
Come in.

08:11.118 --> 08:13.551
Studying on a day like this?

08:13.588 --> 08:15.418
lsn't it a crime
against nature?

08:15.455 --> 08:17.684
Here are the notes you wanted.

08:17.724 --> 08:19.452
You're not gonna say
hello or anything, huh?

08:19.493 --> 08:21.892
l don't have time for a
social call today, Valerie.

08:21.928 --> 08:23.690
l'm giving you my Psych
notes because l owe you.

08:23.730 --> 08:24.889
Now we're even.

08:24.997 --> 08:27.464
Fine.

08:37.876 --> 08:39.399
Wow.

08:39.443 --> 08:40.876
Planning a little getaway?

08:40.910 --> 08:42.571
lt's none of your business.

08:42.613 --> 08:44.135
Quite a vacation.

08:44.181 --> 08:46.410
l wonder what Brandon's
doing this summer?

08:49.019 --> 08:51.316
Thanks for the notes.

09:02.664 --> 09:04.187
Ray, l have to study.

09:04.232 --> 09:05.721
l still have three finals left.

09:05.767 --> 09:07.757
Look, you had all
the time in the world

09:07.801 --> 09:09.859
to get ready
for Andrea's party.

09:09.904 --> 09:12.064
Please, don't keep
throwing that up to me.

09:12.106 --> 09:13.868
She's one of
my best friends.

09:13.908 --> 09:15.204
What am l?

09:15.241 --> 09:16.537
Ray...

09:16.576 --> 09:18.202
Look, l should have
stayed on the road.

09:18.244 --> 09:19.870
l was doing great,
but you kept begging,

09:19.913 --> 09:22.506
so l took a step backward
and came back to L.A.

09:22.549 --> 09:24.880
For you.

09:24.917 --> 09:26.076
Ray, l love you.

09:26.118 --> 09:27.880
You know how happy
l am that you're here.

09:27.986 --> 09:30.715
You say that all the time,
but you never show it.

09:31.924 --> 09:33.185
You mean sex.

09:33.224 --> 09:35.748
Listen to me. l'm
telling you l need you.

09:35.793 --> 09:37.885
l need your time.

09:37.929 --> 09:39.862
And l'm sorry.

09:39.897 --> 09:41.488
Look, as soon
as my finals are over,

09:41.531 --> 09:43.725
l'll have the whole summer off
just to be with you,

09:43.767 --> 09:45.563
and in the meantime,

09:45.602 --> 09:47.899
why don't you come with me
to Andrea's good-bye tomorrow?

09:47.938 --> 09:49.427
No, thanks.

09:49.471 --> 09:50.494
Come on.

09:50.539 --> 09:52.165
At least we can be together.

09:52.207 --> 09:54.572
Look, strolling down
memory lane with you

09:54.610 --> 09:55.906
and the gang
from high school,

09:55.945 --> 09:57.844
doesn't sound like
that much fun to me.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.369
Well, Clare's going with David,

09:59.414 --> 10:01.244
and she didn't go
to high school with us.

10:01.282 --> 10:03.078
All the more reason
l'm staying home.

10:03.117 --> 10:04.447
l thought you liked them.

10:04.485 --> 10:06.315
l mean, last week we were
talking double dates.

10:06.354 --> 10:08.651
Look, Donna, they're
your friends, okay?

10:08.689 --> 10:10.246
Let's just keep it that way.

10:10.290 --> 10:12.587
Then they don't have to pretend
they like me any more

10:12.626 --> 10:13.592
than l like them.

10:13.627 --> 10:15.924
-That is not true.
-lt is.

10:15.962 --> 10:18.122
And l could ask you
to make a choice,

10:18.164 --> 10:20.188
but l won't.

10:22.301 --> 10:24.131
Okay.

10:24.169 --> 10:27.262
l understand,
and l appreciate it.

10:27.305 --> 10:29.101
What if l did ask you?

10:30.342 --> 10:32.036
Would you choose me?

10:33.844 --> 10:35.743
That's not fair.

10:35.779 --> 10:38.838
Look, you budgeted
a half hour for lunch.

10:38.882 --> 10:41.577
Do you want to argue,
or do you want to eat?

10:41.618 --> 10:45.576
l think l lost my appetite.

10:51.927 --> 10:53.791
Wow. Hong Kong.

10:53.829 --> 10:55.557
Do you think they'll
actually go through with it?

10:55.597 --> 10:57.723
l don't know. l guess
there's a lot of work there

10:57.766 --> 10:58.789
for accountants
getting ready

10:58.833 --> 11:00.493
for when the lease
runs out in '97.

11:00.534 --> 11:03.525
Well, what is Cindy
gonna do over there?

11:03.571 --> 11:04.537
Well, she'll have

11:04.572 --> 11:05.629
her master's degree.

11:05.673 --> 11:07.902
Maybe the Chinese
need family counselors.

11:07.974 --> 11:10.032
Who only speak English?

11:10.076 --> 11:11.906
l don't know
what they're gonna do,

11:11.945 --> 11:13.138
but they haven't traveled much.

11:13.179 --> 11:14.167
l think they're gonna go.

11:14.214 --> 11:15.908
Well, they're not the only one

11:15.948 --> 11:17.141
with the travel bug around here.

11:17.182 --> 11:18.273
Where you going?

11:19.318 --> 11:20.841
Not me.

11:22.621 --> 11:24.178
Well, then, who?

11:24.222 --> 11:26.314
Kelly didn't tell you?

11:28.159 --> 11:29.455
Kelly didn't tell me what?

11:31.262 --> 11:35.288
Brandon, when l tell you this,
it's not gossip.

11:35.332 --> 11:36.764
And l'm not telling you
to hurt you.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.460
But if l were you,
l'd want to know.

11:38.502 --> 11:39.468
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Val,

11:39.503 --> 11:40.833
get to the point.

11:42.238 --> 11:44.569
Dylan's planning on a trip
to go around the world...

11:45.775 --> 11:47.765
...and Kelly's going with him.

11:52.614 --> 11:54.740
And she told you this?

11:54.783 --> 11:56.113
Not exactly.

11:56.151 --> 11:57.913
l saw the tickets on the desk.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.043
l'm sorry, l just...

12:00.087 --> 12:03.681
it kills me that she's fooling
around on you like this.

12:05.292 --> 12:08.749
Val, could... could you
do me a favor, and, uh...

12:08.795 --> 12:11.058
l want to be alone
for a minute.

12:11.097 --> 12:14.156
Yeah, if you need me,
you just let me know, okay?

12:14.200 --> 12:16.064
Yeah, thanks.

12:24.275 --> 12:27.903
Yeah, l figured you'd be paying
me a visit sooner or later.

12:27.945 --> 12:29.878
You mind telling me
what's going on?

12:29.914 --> 12:31.904
lnviting my girlfriend
to go on trips with you

12:31.949 --> 12:33.074
around the world?

12:33.116 --> 12:34.707
l like to travel;
it's nothing personal.

12:34.751 --> 12:36.183
Come on, man, it's
totally personal.

12:36.219 --> 12:38.015
l'm just doing
what l got to do.

12:38.054 --> 12:39.145
Fine, then l'll do
what l got to do.

12:39.189 --> 12:40.280
l know you love her, Bran,

12:40.323 --> 12:43.052
but me and Kelly,
we're connected

12:43.092 --> 12:45.389
in a way that you'll
never understand.

12:45.427 --> 12:46.518
Ever.

12:58.638 --> 13:01.333
Special delivery
for Miss Kelly Taylor.

13:02.809 --> 13:03.968
What is this?

13:04.010 --> 13:05.306
lt's not my birthday.

13:05.345 --> 13:07.574
lt's just a little something
l thought you needed.

13:10.816 --> 13:12.680
New Rollerblades?

13:12.718 --> 13:13.877
l know you've
been practicing,

13:13.986 --> 13:15.111
and these will definitely
improve your form.

13:15.153 --> 13:16.119
Thank you.

13:16.154 --> 13:17.177
You're welcome.

13:17.222 --> 13:18.279
You want to go try 'em out?

13:18.323 --> 13:19.414
l've got mine in my trunk.

13:19.457 --> 13:20.787
-No, l have to study.
-Oh, come on, come on.

13:20.825 --> 13:22.121
You've been studying
like a madwoman. Let's go.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.320
-You are a bad influence on me.
-Yes, l know l am.

13:24.361 --> 13:25.827
Come on, let's go.

13:28.465 --> 13:29.988
So, how do they fit?

13:30.033 --> 13:31.499
Perfect.

13:31.535 --> 13:33.627
You probably want to try on
the other one, you know.

13:33.669 --> 13:36.193
One of your feet is generally
larger than the other one.

13:38.107 --> 13:39.903
There's something
in there.

13:39.942 --> 13:41.602
Be careful. lt might
be a black widow

13:41.643 --> 13:43.234
Oh! Get it off me!

13:43.278 --> 13:44.642
What is it?

13:46.581 --> 13:48.013
You're right, there
is something in there.

13:48.049 --> 13:49.538
A spider?

13:49.583 --> 13:50.913
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

13:53.087 --> 13:54.849
Well, l don't think
it's a spider,

13:54.889 --> 13:57.152
unless they hide in little
black velvet boxes.

13:57.191 --> 13:59.715
Brandon, what'd you do?

13:59.759 --> 14:01.919
Open it.

14:07.232 --> 14:09.290
lt's beautiful.

14:09.334 --> 14:11.460
lt's no trip around the world,

14:11.503 --> 14:14.960
but... l think we could take
quite a journey together.

14:15.006 --> 14:16.870
Valerie told you.

14:16.974 --> 14:19.840
Yeah. And Dylan
confirmed it.

14:19.877 --> 14:21.810
Are you going to go with him?

14:21.846 --> 14:24.780
l don't know.

14:24.815 --> 14:26.304
He just sprang it
on me yesterday.

14:26.349 --> 14:28.282
Are you in love with him?

14:30.120 --> 14:32.553
l still have feelings for him.

14:32.588 --> 14:34.612
And what about us?

14:36.025 --> 14:38.219
You didn't have to get me
something like this

14:38.260 --> 14:39.749
to show me that you love me.

14:39.795 --> 14:43.662
l know l didn't,
Kelly, but...

14:43.698 --> 14:46.757
l'm not gonna give you up
without a fight.

14:49.636 --> 14:51.159
Will you marry me?

15:02.114 --> 15:04.104
Now, l know it seems
like a big thing Kel,

15:04.150 --> 15:06.049
but l'm not saying we
should do it right away.

15:06.085 --> 15:07.108
l'm just saying...

15:07.152 --> 15:11.212
l want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

15:11.256 --> 15:14.281
l do love you.

15:14.326 --> 15:16.293
ls that a yes?

15:16.327 --> 15:17.418
lt's not a no.

15:17.461 --> 15:18.825
Well, that's a start.

15:20.464 --> 15:22.795
My parents are moving.

15:22.833 --> 15:24.231
Where?

15:24.267 --> 15:25.733
To Hong Kong.

15:27.170 --> 15:29.467
l'm serious.
lt just happened.

15:29.505 --> 15:32.302
And the house is
gonna be empty.

15:32.341 --> 15:35.173
l'd like you to
move in with me.

15:35.210 --> 15:37.268
We don't need
a ring for that.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.370
Ah, but we do.

15:39.414 --> 15:42.177
lt's a sign
of commitment.

15:42.216 --> 15:44.342
Now, l'm not saying you have
to put it on right away,

15:44.385 --> 15:48.878
but... if and when you do,
l'll know what that means.

15:48.922 --> 15:52.857
So no pressure, right?

15:52.893 --> 15:56.658
Kel, about the only
thing l can ask you

15:56.696 --> 15:59.425
is to not go
away with Dylan.

15:59.465 --> 16:01.295
l just need time to think
about everything.

16:01.333 --> 16:02.890
l know.

16:05.037 --> 16:07.334
You know Kel, we've been
through a lot together.

16:07.372 --> 16:09.703
Not just the good
times, but...

16:09.741 --> 16:13.608
Emily, Finley, the fire...

16:13.645 --> 16:16.204
and we're still in love
with each other.

16:16.246 --> 16:18.042
l think that means a lot.

16:20.083 --> 16:23.415
You know what l'd really
like to see right now?

16:23.452 --> 16:25.112
What?

16:25.154 --> 16:27.417
l think l'd like to see you

16:27.456 --> 16:31.687
with that ring on...
and nothing else.

16:31.726 --> 16:33.488
What do you
think of that?

16:33.528 --> 16:34.653
Huh?
Huh?

16:34.696 --> 16:36.856
That sounds
like a good idea.

16:36.898 --> 16:38.421
l think so.

16:43.804 --> 16:45.498
Light crowd
tonight, huh?

16:45.539 --> 16:47.836
Well, C.U. is not the only
college around here

16:47.875 --> 16:49.808
who's having finals
this week.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.103
Shouldn't you be
home studying?

16:51.144 --> 16:53.202
Shouldn't you be getting
ready for the show?

16:53.246 --> 16:55.076
l need to talk to you
about something.

16:55.114 --> 16:56.876
Okay, what's your problem?

16:56.950 --> 16:58.678
Our problem.

16:58.717 --> 17:00.047
Okay, what's our problem?

17:00.085 --> 17:01.051
David and Clare.

17:01.086 --> 17:02.450
They've been on my case.

17:02.487 --> 17:05.614
And what if they spill
the beans to Donna about us?

17:05.656 --> 17:06.987
Ray, would you relax?

17:07.023 --> 17:08.354
You're getting paranoid.

17:08.392 --> 17:10.256
l mean, if they do say
something to Donna,

17:10.294 --> 17:12.590
you can claim your drunken
mother made up the whole thing.

17:12.630 --> 17:14.722
-l hope you're right.
-Look, the bottom line is

17:14.763 --> 17:17.960
that our relationship
is strictly business.

17:18.001 --> 17:19.762
And if Donna doesn't like it,

17:19.803 --> 17:21.429
well, then,
that's her problem...

17:21.471 --> 17:24.233
well, and yours, l guess,
just not mine.

17:24.272 --> 17:26.637
Oh, so you're just
an innocent bystander, huh?

17:26.675 --> 17:30.701
No. l'm a club owner,
and you're my employee.

17:30.746 --> 17:32.838
And as such,
l'd like you to be happy,

17:32.914 --> 17:34.540
so you do
your job well.

17:34.582 --> 17:36.014
But the fact of the matter is,

17:36.050 --> 17:38.916
is that l can't solve your
personal problems for you.

17:40.054 --> 17:42.044
Ah, okay.

17:42.089 --> 17:44.056
Good luck, Ray.

17:45.559 --> 17:49.585
l think it's time that you, uh,
go have a good show.

17:49.628 --> 17:51.185
Hey, Phil.

17:56.168 --> 17:59.967
Wow. When did he
give this to you?

18:00.005 --> 18:02.734
This afternoon... on the beach.

18:02.774 --> 18:03.933
So, if you're engaged,

18:03.975 --> 18:05.601
how come you're keeping
the ring in the box?

18:05.643 --> 18:08.133
l haven't said yes yet.

18:08.178 --> 18:10.338
Why not?

18:10.381 --> 18:13.281
'Cause someone else gave me
something to think about.

18:24.926 --> 18:27.416
Dylan asked me to go around
the world with him.

18:30.732 --> 18:34.223
This, this trip
costs a fortune.

18:34.268 --> 18:36.997
lt seems money's no object
for Dylan these days.

18:37.038 --> 18:39.164
You're not going,
though, right?

18:39.206 --> 18:42.038
l mean, you wouldn't give up
a guy like Brandon

18:42.075 --> 18:43.371
for a fling, would you?

18:43.410 --> 18:45.400
Dylan's not talking
about a fling.

18:45.445 --> 18:47.241
Dylan didn't give you a ring.

18:49.381 --> 18:54.215
Don't think l'm crazy,
because l know this sounds nuts.

18:54.253 --> 18:57.449
l love Brandon
with all my heart...

18:57.488 --> 18:59.182
but with Dylan,

18:59.223 --> 19:01.019
l don't know,

19:01.059 --> 19:03.151
it's like he'll always
have a piece of my soul.

19:04.729 --> 19:06.286
Come in.

19:06.329 --> 19:08.125
There's someone here
to see you.

19:08.165 --> 19:10.428
-Who?
-Dylan.

19:24.512 --> 19:27.776
Wow, you look, uh,
you look great.

19:27.816 --> 19:29.442
What are you doing here?

19:29.484 --> 19:31.610
l came to see if you
made up your mind.

19:31.652 --> 19:34.279
l told you,
l need to think.

19:34.321 --> 19:36.254
You're thinking too hard.

19:36.290 --> 19:40.555
Whatever happened to the
cool, calm Dylan McKay?

19:40.593 --> 19:42.822
Well, the cool,
calm Dylan McKay

19:42.895 --> 19:46.352
just asked for what he needs
for the first time in his life.

19:46.399 --> 19:47.831
l need you.

19:48.867 --> 19:50.834
l need time.

19:52.404 --> 19:55.133
Well, the plane leaves
in four days.

19:56.808 --> 19:59.867
Don't pressure me.

20:06.583 --> 20:09.574
What's that?

20:09.619 --> 20:11.609
What?

20:11.654 --> 20:14.417
What's that thing
on your finger?

20:16.692 --> 20:19.159
l forgot l had it on.

20:19.194 --> 20:22.219
Brandon gave it to me
this afternoon.

20:25.666 --> 20:27.599
You know what?

20:27.635 --> 20:30.000
l don't even need
to know about that.

20:30.037 --> 20:33.096
l just need to know whether
or not you said yes.

20:51.156 --> 20:54.022
We can't just stand
here and stare.

20:54.058 --> 20:56.218
Who's staring?

20:56.261 --> 20:58.751
Come on. Get in here.

20:58.795 --> 21:01.661
So, what do you think
she's gonna do?

21:01.698 --> 21:03.631
l don't know.

21:03.667 --> 21:05.395
Well, l know who l'd pick.

21:05.435 --> 21:06.423
Brandon.

21:06.469 --> 21:07.526
Yeah, wouldn't you?

21:07.570 --> 21:08.831
l don't know.

21:08.938 --> 21:12.373
You know, in high school,
l always used to wonder.

21:12.408 --> 21:14.671
Wait a second--
you had a crush on Dylan?

21:14.709 --> 21:16.403
Everybody did.

21:16.444 --> 21:19.344
Well, l'm not surprised.

21:19.381 --> 21:21.575
You go for those dangerous,

21:21.616 --> 21:23.105
tortured types.

21:23.150 --> 21:24.616
You get off on the melodrama.

21:24.652 --> 21:26.312
l do not.

21:27.555 --> 21:29.249
l do?

21:30.758 --> 21:32.054
Maybe one of these days,

21:32.091 --> 21:34.320
you'll look for a guy
that takes care of you.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.190
l don't know what
you're talking about.

21:36.229 --> 21:37.320
Yeah, you do.

21:37.363 --> 21:39.330
Don't hate me for saying this--

21:39.365 --> 21:40.422
but you could do

21:40.465 --> 21:41.829
so much better than Ray.

21:43.468 --> 21:46.959
Look, Clare, l know you
and David don't like Ray,

21:47.005 --> 21:48.198
but l do.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.729
We're very happy.

21:49.774 --> 21:51.866
And you know what,
l don't need to defend him

21:51.943 --> 21:53.273
to you, or anybody else.

21:53.311 --> 21:54.504
l know. l'm sorry.

21:54.545 --> 21:56.671
l shouldn't interfere.

21:56.714 --> 21:59.011
No, you're right, you shouldn't.

21:59.049 --> 22:01.573
Especially when you're going
out with my ex-boyfriend.

22:01.618 --> 22:03.141
Don...

22:03.186 --> 22:04.675
No, l'm going to bed.

22:17.732 --> 22:18.720
Good, you're here.

22:18.766 --> 22:19.823
Where's Valerie?

22:19.901 --> 22:20.924
l don't know.

22:20.969 --> 22:22.367
Val!

22:24.972 --> 22:26.802
Hey.

22:26.840 --> 22:29.034
What's going on?

22:29.076 --> 22:31.805
Uh...
let's all sit down.

22:33.946 --> 22:36.311
Well, we just wanted
you both to know

22:36.349 --> 22:39.044
that we've made
a decision.

22:39.085 --> 22:41.143
We're taking the plunge.

22:41.186 --> 22:42.846
Well, the-the
plane, actually.

22:42.887 --> 22:44.581
We're... we're
going to Hong Kong.

22:44.623 --> 22:46.317
Well, that's great!

22:46.358 --> 22:48.848
You guys will have
a wonderful time.

22:48.926 --> 22:50.688
Well, it's a big decision,

22:50.728 --> 22:52.854
and there's still a lot
of things to consider.

22:52.930 --> 22:55.625
Yeah, and we want you both
to be comfortable with this.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.565
You know, whatever we have
to deal with, we'll...

22:57.600 --> 22:59.692
cross those bridges
when we get there.

23:01.671 --> 23:03.467
So, what do you think?

23:05.507 --> 23:08.339
l gave Kelly
an engagement ring today.

23:08.377 --> 23:09.707
-You did...
-What?

23:09.745 --> 23:11.405
You asked her to marry you?

23:12.614 --> 23:13.580
What did she say?

23:13.615 --> 23:14.774
She's thinking about it.

23:14.815 --> 23:16.941
You guys aren't selling
the house, are you?

23:16.984 --> 23:20.714
Well... l mean,
we don't know yet.

23:20.755 --> 23:22.654
We could be gone
for a good few years.

23:22.689 --> 23:24.246
l wish you would've told me.

23:24.291 --> 23:25.814
Well, honey, we are telling you.

23:25.859 --> 23:28.122
We just made this decision
a few minutes ago.

23:28.161 --> 23:30.458
You'll always have
a place to live.

23:31.897 --> 23:34.057
You sure about getting married?

23:35.334 --> 23:37.733
Are you sure
about going to Hong Kong?

24:33.251 --> 24:35.184
Oh, l feel like
l'm being kidnapped.

24:35.220 --> 24:36.652
Well, you are.

24:36.688 --> 24:37.813
Where are we going?

24:37.856 --> 24:39.652
Jesse, l feel
totally disoriented.

24:39.690 --> 24:41.680
Well, that's the
whole idea, Andrea.

24:41.726 --> 24:42.953
How much longer
is it gonna take?

24:42.993 --> 24:44.550
You know, you are

24:44.595 --> 24:46.755
the most impatient person
l've ever met in my entire life.

24:46.797 --> 24:48.821
l am not impatient, okay?
l'm curious, that's all.

24:48.898 --> 24:50.125
All right, well,

24:50.166 --> 24:51.655
you can stop your
guessing, milady,

24:51.701 --> 24:55.602
'cause we are... here.

24:55.638 --> 24:57.832
Here.

24:57.906 --> 25:00.499
Yeah. You can now take
your blindfold off.

25:00.542 --> 25:03.533
All right.

25:08.449 --> 25:10.507
Ta-da!

25:10.551 --> 25:13.542
You are... this
is unbelievable!

25:15.455 --> 25:17.615
Oh, l can't believe it.

25:20.293 --> 25:22.783
Oh, hi, honey.

25:22.862 --> 25:24.658
Look-- this is where
Mommy went to school.

25:24.697 --> 25:26.288
-Yep.
-Yeah.

25:26.332 --> 25:28.561
Your mommy was not only the
smartest girl in the school,

25:28.601 --> 25:29.794
she was also
the prettiest.

25:29.869 --> 25:33.099
Oh, yes...

25:33.138 --> 25:35.332
...too late to take that SAT
prep course now,

25:35.373 --> 25:37.431
but it's never too late
to ask that someone special

25:37.475 --> 25:39.101
to tomorrow night's
big West Beverly Prom.

25:39.144 --> 25:40.610
This is quite a campus

25:40.644 --> 25:42.133
for a public school.

25:42.179 --> 25:45.170
This is quite a campus
for any school, Miss Euro Prep.

25:45.215 --> 25:47.580
Here, Donna, l'll take that.

25:47.618 --> 25:49.915
Hey, aren't you Donna Martin?

25:49.952 --> 25:51.475
Yeah.

25:51.521 --> 25:53.283
No way! l'm a senior,
and l remember you.

25:53.322 --> 25:54.481
Oh, you, uh,

25:54.524 --> 25:56.423
probably heard me here
on campus radio.

25:56.459 --> 25:57.584
No.

25:57.626 --> 25:59.650
You're the girl
that threw up at prom.

26:01.062 --> 26:02.494
Passed out.

26:02.531 --> 26:03.861
Yeah, same difference.

26:03.899 --> 26:05.866
l was a sophomore,
and l marched for you.

26:05.900 --> 26:08.333
Um... ''Donna Martin graduates!''

26:08.369 --> 26:09.335
Right.

26:09.370 --> 26:11.769
Well, you know,
thanks for your support.

26:11.806 --> 26:13.363
Yeah, no problem.
My prom's tomorrow night.

26:13.407 --> 26:14.464
Well, be safe

26:14.507 --> 26:16.997
and sober, and watch out
for Mrs. Teasley.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.134
Yeah, l'll remember that.

26:18.178 --> 26:19.474
Hi, Jill.

26:19.512 --> 26:21.069
We'll see you
tomorrow night?

26:21.114 --> 26:23.411
Hi, Mrs. Teasley.

26:23.449 --> 26:25.382
Bye, Mrs. Teasley.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.678
You're famous.

26:26.718 --> 26:28.685
-lnfamous.
-Hi.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.880
-Thank you for coming.
-Oh, l wouldn't have missed it

26:30.922 --> 26:31.945
for the world.

26:31.989 --> 26:33.285
How you doing,
Mrs. Teasley?

26:33.324 --> 26:35.484
lt's great to see you--
not in detention.

26:35.526 --> 26:36.924
lt's good to see all of you.

26:36.961 --> 26:38.188
So, where's the guest of honor?

26:38.229 --> 26:39.661
You guys!

26:39.696 --> 26:42.789
This... this is
unbelievable.

26:42.833 --> 26:44.800
Well, we just figured
we'd come back

26:44.835 --> 26:47.200
to where it all began,
that's all. Hey, Jess.

26:47.237 --> 26:49.704
Back in high school,
before l had a life,

26:49.738 --> 26:51.637
this is where l spent
all my waking hours.

26:51.674 --> 26:52.697
Oh, yeah?

26:52.741 --> 26:54.173
-Mm-hmm.
-Andrea.

26:54.210 --> 26:57.337
Mrs. Teasley!

26:57.378 --> 26:59.811
-How are you?
-l'm just wonderful.

26:59.914 --> 27:01.710
So, introduce me
to this beautiful

27:01.749 --> 27:02.874
daughter of yours.

27:02.917 --> 27:05.350
Well, this is Hannah Rose.

27:05.385 --> 27:07.284
She's perfect!

27:07.321 --> 27:09.288
And this is my husband,
Jesse Vasquez.

27:09.323 --> 27:11.119
-lt's a pleasure to meet you.
-Likewise.

27:11.158 --> 27:12.749
So, where's Brandon and Dylan?

27:12.860 --> 27:14.121
l don't know.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.354
l don't think
they're gonna show up.

27:16.395 --> 27:17.554
Are you kidding?

27:17.597 --> 27:20.588
How could they do
this to Andrea?

27:20.633 --> 27:23.931
You guys, now l know why
you kept this a secret.

27:23.969 --> 27:26.198
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

27:26.238 --> 27:28.262
Well, don't look now,

27:28.306 --> 27:30.136
but another surprise
is heading your way.

27:30.175 --> 27:33.905
Andrea Zuckerman,
this is your life.

27:33.944 --> 27:35.774
Andrea.

27:37.414 --> 27:39.540
Gil Meyers!
What are you doing here?

27:39.582 --> 27:42.106
He works here.

27:42.151 --> 27:43.981
l heard you were
heading off to Yale.

27:44.020 --> 27:46.351
Yes, can you believe it?
And it's all his fault.

27:46.389 --> 27:47.582
Then you must be Jesse.

27:47.624 --> 27:49.488
l've heard a lot
about you, Gil. Pleasure.

27:49.525 --> 27:51.082
This is our daughter, Hannah.

27:51.126 --> 27:54.026
Hey! She is beautiful.

27:54.062 --> 27:56.621
You know, if you have
an hour or two, l could

27:56.664 --> 27:58.028
show you pictures
of my baby boy.

27:58.065 --> 28:00.589
Great! l'd love to see them.

28:00.635 --> 28:04.070
l always remembered this class
with a special fondness.

28:04.105 --> 28:06.163
-Even me, Mrs. Teasley?
-Oh, especially you, Steve.

28:06.206 --> 28:09.800
Since you spent more time
in my office than anybody else.

28:12.145 --> 28:13.736
All right, everybody,
hold on for a second.

28:13.779 --> 28:15.609
We have a special presentation
to make.

28:15.648 --> 28:17.547
Yes, we couldn't let
you and Hannah

28:17.583 --> 28:19.641
go to Yale
without the proper attire.

28:19.685 --> 28:22.915
So, we have Mommy and baby
sweatshirts from C.U.

28:22.954 --> 28:24.352
Oh!

28:24.389 --> 28:26.413
Oh, this is great.
Look at that!

28:26.457 --> 28:27.684
And a Mommy and baby

28:27.725 --> 28:29.589
West Beverly High T-shirts.

28:29.627 --> 28:32.288
Aw, you guys, perfect.

28:32.329 --> 28:34.660
We just wanted
to make sure you remember

28:34.698 --> 28:35.925
where you come from.

28:35.966 --> 28:37.557
l'll never forget that.

28:37.601 --> 28:39.261
And l'll never
forget you guys.

28:39.302 --> 28:41.633
We've known each other
for a long time, Zuckerman.

28:41.671 --> 28:43.865
We sure have.

28:43.906 --> 28:47.568
West Bev, ninth grade,
Miss Brewster's class.

28:47.610 --> 28:49.474
-Oh, boy!
-Remember?

28:49.511 --> 28:51.671
Oh, yeah. That's the first time
l ever got a B--

28:51.713 --> 28:53.771
in English, anyway.

28:53.848 --> 28:56.441
Don't think l could've done that
without your help, Andrea.

28:57.918 --> 28:59.475
Who's gonna write
my papers now?

28:59.520 --> 29:02.215
-Guess you'll have to.
-Not.

29:02.256 --> 29:04.280
l think l'll just
have Brandon do 'em.

29:05.625 --> 29:06.989
Where is Brandon
and Dylan, by the way?

29:07.026 --> 29:08.822
l thought for sure
they'd be here.

29:08.861 --> 29:10.327
Yeah, Brandon really
wanted to come,

29:10.363 --> 29:12.762
but with his family moving
and everything...

29:24.942 --> 29:27.535
Kel, l know
what's going on.

29:27.578 --> 29:30.705
He called me last night;
he told me everything.

29:30.747 --> 29:32.737
So, what are you gonna do?

29:32.782 --> 29:34.874
l wish l knew.

29:38.822 --> 29:41.119
Come on.

29:49.631 --> 29:50.995
Ray, you came!

29:51.032 --> 29:52.396
You talked me into it.

29:52.433 --> 29:54.764
Look, everybody.
Look who's here.

29:54.802 --> 29:56.098
Thrilling.

29:56.137 --> 29:57.763
Gee, if we're lucky,

29:57.804 --> 30:00.431
maybe he brought his guitar
and he'll serenade us all.

30:00.474 --> 30:02.031
-Hey, Ray.
-Hey.

30:02.075 --> 30:03.871
Well, good luck, Andrea.

30:03.910 --> 30:05.137
Thanks, Ray.

30:05.177 --> 30:06.438
Can l get you

30:06.479 --> 30:07.638
a piece of Donna's
chocolate cake?

30:07.680 --> 30:08.771
Nah, that's
all right.

30:08.814 --> 30:11.008
We can't stay long.

30:11.050 --> 30:12.676
What do you mean?

30:12.718 --> 30:14.912
-We just got here.
-Well, when you're,

30:14.953 --> 30:17.785
uh, when you're done,
l'll give you a ride home.

30:17.889 --> 30:19.685
Um, actually, Kelly,
Clare and l were planning

30:19.724 --> 30:21.520
on going over to Andrea's
after the party.

30:21.559 --> 30:24.220
Kind of like a final meeting
of the Peach Pit sorority

30:24.261 --> 30:26.194
before l take off
for the lvy League.

30:26.230 --> 30:28.220
l see.

30:28.265 --> 30:30.323
-Busy schedule.
-Ray...

30:30.367 --> 30:32.527
See you around.

30:33.569 --> 30:37.299
l, uh... l got to go.

30:40.542 --> 30:43.271
Ray... please
don't leave angry.

30:43.311 --> 30:44.607
But l am angry.

30:44.646 --> 30:46.806
Look, Andrea's one
of my best friends.

30:46.848 --> 30:48.644
How many times
have you said that?

30:48.683 --> 30:51.549
How many times do you plan
on saying good-bye to her?

30:51.585 --> 30:53.142
That is not fair.

30:53.187 --> 30:55.211
Who said l had to be fair?

30:55.256 --> 30:56.517
Please...

30:56.556 --> 30:57.681
please don't go!

30:57.724 --> 30:59.554
l hate when you
get like this.

30:59.592 --> 31:00.819
l'm sorry, okay?

31:00.894 --> 31:02.952
Well, you should have
thought about that before.

31:02.996 --> 31:04.860
You are so spoiled and selfish.

31:04.897 --> 31:06.761
l don't even know
why l bother.

31:06.832 --> 31:09.299
Please don't say that.
l love you.

31:09.334 --> 31:11.028
Oh, so now
you're gonna cry, huh?

31:11.070 --> 31:12.764
How typical--
can't get what you want,

31:12.805 --> 31:14.328
so you turn on the faucets.

31:14.372 --> 31:16.100
Fine. l won't go to Andrea's.

31:16.140 --> 31:17.766
Will that make you happy?!

31:17.842 --> 31:19.502
Don't do me any favors,
all right?

31:19.544 --> 31:22.239
l am so sick of you
and your spoiled, rich friends.

31:22.279 --> 31:23.506
l'm getting out of here.

31:23.547 --> 31:26.344
Do me a favor, don't call me!

31:26.383 --> 31:28.316
Don't worry,
you can count on it.

31:43.898 --> 31:45.797
Yep?

31:45.900 --> 31:47.958
-Hey.
-Hey.

31:48.001 --> 31:49.695
Thought you might be hungry.

31:49.737 --> 31:51.033
Starved.
How'd you know?

31:51.071 --> 31:53.038
Well, doesn't everybody
pig out during finals?

31:53.073 --> 31:55.165
Oh, man, if l get
through this one,

31:55.209 --> 31:57.176
l'll get through
the rest of my life.

31:57.210 --> 31:58.767
Well, you've had a lot
of distractions

31:58.811 --> 32:00.573
-the last couple days.
-Mm-hmm.

32:00.613 --> 32:02.580
Has Kelly given you
an answer yet?

32:02.615 --> 32:03.911
Nope.

32:03.950 --> 32:05.746
lt must be bugging you.

32:05.784 --> 32:07.080
No, l'm fine.

32:07.119 --> 32:08.415
Brandon, come on.

32:08.453 --> 32:09.749
lt's me.

32:09.788 --> 32:11.311
l've known you your whole life.

32:11.356 --> 32:14.153
All right, it's killing me.
Are you happy now?

32:15.192 --> 32:16.920
Well, l totally understand.

32:16.961 --> 32:18.951
Well, l'm glad you do,
'cause l don't.

32:18.996 --> 32:20.462
Well, that's because
you don't have

32:20.498 --> 32:22.397
a manipulative
bone in your body.

32:22.432 --> 32:23.295
ls that a compliment?

32:23.333 --> 32:25.095
The greatest.

32:25.135 --> 32:27.694
But you don't know people.

32:27.737 --> 32:29.465
And you certainly
don't know women.

32:30.806 --> 32:33.865
So you're saying
that Kelly's manipulating me?

32:33.909 --> 32:37.469
All l know is,
if l had a guy like you

32:37.513 --> 32:39.571
give me an engagement ring,

32:39.614 --> 32:41.774
l wouldn't be
stringing you along.

32:41.849 --> 32:44.612
Well, it's her decision to make.

32:44.652 --> 32:48.087
Do you want to know
what l really think?

32:48.121 --> 32:49.781
l'm not sure.

32:49.890 --> 32:51.379
Well, l'm gonna tell you
anyways.

32:51.424 --> 32:54.153
-Okay.
-l hope that Kelly

32:54.194 --> 32:58.220
chooses Dylan... because l think
you deserve better.

33:09.140 --> 33:12.233
You feel like
some company?

33:12.277 --> 33:13.971
No, l'm all right.

33:21.784 --> 33:24.115
Why does it always
have to be so hard?

33:28.090 --> 33:30.990
Because we don't fall
in love with fantasies.

33:31.026 --> 33:33.186
We fall in love
with real people.

33:35.263 --> 33:38.595
Real idiots, if you ask me.

33:38.633 --> 33:40.896
What's wrong with men?

33:40.935 --> 33:45.997
l've been asking myself
that same question.

33:46.040 --> 33:50.271
lt's always about
him, you know?

33:50.310 --> 33:55.770
What he needs, what he wants.

33:55.849 --> 33:58.043
Sounds like the men
l know.

33:58.083 --> 34:02.041
No, Brandon's not like that.

34:02.087 --> 34:06.079
Not all the time,
but he has his moments...

34:06.123 --> 34:07.612
like today;

34:07.658 --> 34:10.217
his own personal discomfort
was more important

34:10.261 --> 34:11.955
than going to Andrea's lunch.

34:13.463 --> 34:15.123
And Dylan?

34:15.165 --> 34:19.157
Donna, Dylan is one of the most
self-centered people

34:19.202 --> 34:20.862
on the planet Earth.

34:20.904 --> 34:23.496
And according to him, he's been
that way for several lifetimes.

34:23.539 --> 34:26.938
But you love them anyway.

34:26.976 --> 34:28.909
Yeah.

34:33.982 --> 34:38.007
Has, um...

34:38.052 --> 34:43.887
either Brandon or Dylan
ever been mean to you?

34:43.924 --> 34:46.221
Mean?

34:46.260 --> 34:50.320
No, not Brandon.

34:50.362 --> 34:53.331
Dylan only when
he's been drinking.

34:56.167 --> 35:01.570
Sometimes Ray can be...

35:01.606 --> 35:05.302
l don't know, just...

35:05.342 --> 35:07.070
He hurts my feelings.

35:07.111 --> 35:10.136
He puts me down.

35:10.180 --> 35:11.874
Then why do you stay
with him?

35:14.450 --> 35:16.679
l love him.

35:16.719 --> 35:21.280
l told him not to call me
anymore.

35:21.324 --> 35:23.723
l wish l could take back
every word.

35:26.428 --> 35:29.487
Well, if you love him,

35:29.531 --> 35:32.465
then l guess you should probably
follow your heart.

35:32.500 --> 35:34.990
ls that what you're gonna do?

35:35.036 --> 35:38.368
l'm gonna try.

35:42.108 --> 35:49.411
Sometimes, when l'm with Ray,
l just feel so confused.

35:49.448 --> 35:54.146
l don't, l don't know who l am
or what l want.

35:54.186 --> 35:56.050
That's totally
understandable.

35:56.087 --> 36:01.456
l mean, it's natural to let go
of a part of yourself

36:01.492 --> 36:04.051
to be with someone else,
you know?

36:04.095 --> 36:06.961
But the important part is that
you don't lose

36:06.997 --> 36:08.588
your own identity
in the process.

36:08.632 --> 36:11.361
Thanks, Kel.

36:11.401 --> 36:13.391
Are you gonna be okay?

36:13.436 --> 36:16.097
l think so.

36:16.138 --> 36:18.503
'Cause l'll be right inside
if you need me.

36:26.381 --> 36:27.972
Oh, hey!

36:28.016 --> 36:30.711
l ordered a bunch of sandwiches
and some pie for the road.

36:30.784 --> 36:31.909
Do you want anything else?

36:31.952 --> 36:35.352
Oh, Coffee, tons of coffee.

36:35.389 --> 36:38.186
Don't worry about it;
you can sleep till Utah.

36:38.225 --> 36:40.590
That's only if Hannah lets
me sleep, right, baby girl?

36:40.626 --> 36:41.853
You'll let Mama sleep,
won't you?

36:41.894 --> 36:44.020
-Are you gonna let Mama sleep?
-Huh?

36:48.734 --> 36:50.997
Honey, we're gonna get food,
and then we're gonna go...

36:56.073 --> 36:57.937
-You guys are too much.
-Andrea!

36:57.975 --> 37:00.374
Well, you didn't think we were
gonna let you get out of town

37:00.411 --> 37:02.310
without saying good-bye,
now, did you?

37:02.346 --> 37:04.677
How am l supposed to leave?

37:04.781 --> 37:06.338
Because you want this,
remember?

37:08.485 --> 37:10.384
l never thought it was
gonna be this hard.

37:10.420 --> 37:13.320
Now, Hannah, l want you to
remember these faces, okay?

37:13.355 --> 37:14.912
Because l'm going
to be telling you

37:14.957 --> 37:16.981
all the stories of the things
that we did together.

37:17.026 --> 37:19.550
All the fun times,
all the tears,

37:19.595 --> 37:21.391
and l want you to
tell your children

37:21.430 --> 37:22.987
-and your children's children.
-Great.

37:23.031 --> 37:24.691
Countless generations are gonna
know all our problems.

37:24.732 --> 37:26.221
They're all lies, Hannah.

37:26.267 --> 37:28.427
-Your mom's telling you lies.
-Don't listen to her.

37:28.469 --> 37:30.436
Steve, you better be nice
to me-- l have something

37:30.470 --> 37:31.697
in that diaper bag that
you need very badly.

37:31.805 --> 37:33.465
She saved you
a dirty diaper.

37:33.507 --> 37:35.531
No...

37:35.575 --> 37:37.565
a term paper.

37:37.611 --> 37:38.838
-You did it?
-Of course l did.

37:38.878 --> 37:40.606
What, you thought l wasn't gonna
come through for you?

37:40.646 --> 37:41.942
No, actually,

37:41.981 --> 37:43.345
l-l took what
you said to heart.

37:43.382 --> 37:44.370
l did one myself.

37:44.417 --> 37:45.542
Oh, you did?

37:45.584 --> 37:47.448
Well, then l guess we can just
throw that away.

37:47.485 --> 37:49.577
No! No, no, no!
Yours may be better.

37:49.621 --> 37:50.609
-May be?
-May be better?

37:50.655 --> 37:52.815
lt's thicker.

37:52.857 --> 37:54.380
Here, honey,
this is for you.

37:54.426 --> 37:55.722
-Oh.
-Here, let me.

37:55.793 --> 37:56.724
Go to Daddy.

37:56.794 --> 37:58.727
-Yeah.
-Go on to Daddy.

37:58.762 --> 38:02.458
Oh, Nat, you shouldn't have,
but since you did...

38:05.068 --> 38:08.935
Oh, Nat, the original
Peach Pit menu.

38:08.971 --> 38:11.461
Read the inscription.

38:11.507 --> 38:15.670
''To Andrea, you've always been
my favorite dish.

38:15.744 --> 38:17.370
Love, Nat.''

38:19.648 --> 38:22.309
You'll always have a
table here, darlin'.

38:22.349 --> 38:23.576
Thank you.

38:23.617 --> 38:24.640
You're welcome.

38:24.685 --> 38:27.278
l'm gonna miss you guys so much.

38:27.321 --> 38:30.517
l want you all to know how much
you mean to me.

38:30.557 --> 38:33.354
David...

38:33.393 --> 38:35.155
you were the best babysitter
Hannah ever had,

38:35.195 --> 38:37.025
so you better
come visit us

38:37.063 --> 38:38.927
or she's never gonna forgive me.

38:38.964 --> 38:40.487
l'll be there.

38:40.532 --> 38:42.089
Okay.

38:42.134 --> 38:43.430
Bye, Andrea.

38:43.469 --> 38:44.594
Bye.

38:50.541 --> 38:53.236
Donna, you remember that time
at Magic Mountain

38:53.277 --> 38:55.141
when we talked
about the wild ride?

38:55.179 --> 38:58.147
The last two members
of the Virgin Club.

38:58.181 --> 38:59.238
Well, l took the ride.

38:59.282 --> 39:00.908
lt was a little wilder
than l thought.

39:02.452 --> 39:06.547
You be proud
of your decision

39:06.589 --> 39:07.885
and of your character.

39:07.923 --> 39:11.221
Hey, l'm no saint.

39:11.260 --> 39:13.750
You're the closest
thing to one l know.

39:19.134 --> 39:22.625
And you, you saved my marriage.

39:22.669 --> 39:24.226
Oh, no.

39:24.271 --> 39:26.431
You did that all by yourself.

39:26.473 --> 39:28.565
l was just your friend.

39:28.609 --> 39:30.599
The best.

39:40.519 --> 39:43.351
And Kelly, you were
with me at the clinic

39:43.388 --> 39:47.050
when l made the hardest
decision of my life.

39:47.091 --> 39:49.183
You made the right one.

39:49.226 --> 39:51.853
l know l did.

39:55.199 --> 39:57.291
Go for the brass ring, Kelly.

39:57.333 --> 39:59.459
Marry him.

39:59.502 --> 40:00.968
l'll let you know.

40:05.240 --> 40:07.969
Oh, l feel like Dorothy
leaving Oz.

40:11.079 --> 40:13.069
Steve, what can l say?

40:13.114 --> 40:14.842
l love you.

40:14.882 --> 40:17.281
l love you, too, Andrea.
l'll miss you.

40:17.318 --> 40:18.375
Oh.

40:18.419 --> 40:20.010
My grades will miss you.

40:29.296 --> 40:34.096
Brandon, you are my best friend,
and you always will be.

40:34.133 --> 40:36.498
Gonna miss you.

40:36.535 --> 40:37.865
l'm gonna miss you, too.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.530
Go get 'em, chief.

40:44.709 --> 40:46.300
Hey, Andrea,

40:46.344 --> 40:47.833
we better get going.

40:49.179 --> 40:51.237
Yep, gotta go.

40:51.281 --> 40:52.304
Where's the food?

40:52.349 --> 40:53.747
The food, the food!

40:53.817 --> 40:55.340
We gotta have the food!

40:57.186 --> 40:58.880
We'll miss you, Andrea.

40:58.921 --> 41:00.911
We'll miss you, too, Jess.

41:00.957 --> 41:02.048
Take care of yourself.

41:02.091 --> 41:03.682
lt's time to go.

41:04.793 --> 41:05.850
See you later, Andrea.

41:05.894 --> 41:06.860
Bye. Love you.

41:06.895 --> 41:08.054
Take care, Jesse.

41:08.096 --> 41:10.325
Drive safely, guys.

42:05.213 --> 42:06.839
Look, guys,
l gotta get going.

42:06.881 --> 42:09.348
One more final
and l'm a junior.

42:09.384 --> 42:11.180
Hopefully.

42:11.219 --> 42:13.379
See you guys later.

42:13.420 --> 42:14.977
See ya.

42:15.022 --> 42:16.682
l'm gonna go turn
the paper in.

42:16.757 --> 42:19.281
The paper l wrote.

42:19.326 --> 42:21.657
Even though l know
Andrea's is better,

42:21.694 --> 42:24.526
l, l just think it's
the thing to do.

42:24.563 --> 42:26.826
-Later, man.
-Later.

42:27.867 --> 42:29.766
Can l talk to you guys?

42:32.704 --> 42:34.398
You guys have made
my life

42:34.439 --> 42:36.906
very difficult
the past few days.

42:36.941 --> 42:38.703
And it hasn't been easy,

42:38.742 --> 42:40.641
'cause l love you both.

42:40.678 --> 42:44.443
You may not believe that,
but it's true.

42:46.650 --> 42:48.446
Brandon, l can't accept this.

42:50.486 --> 42:52.680
Wait, please?

42:55.291 --> 42:56.655
Dylan,

42:56.692 --> 42:58.454
have a nice trip.

42:58.493 --> 43:00.722
l can't go with you.

43:00.829 --> 43:03.023
Not this time.

43:03.065 --> 43:06.192
l've made my choice,
and l choose me.

43:06.233 --> 43:09.395
l hope you understand.

43:09.437 --> 43:11.495
l'll love you both
till the day l die.
