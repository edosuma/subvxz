00:04.400 --> 00:05.200
Goldilocks!

00:05.320 --> 00:06.160
Who the fuck are--

00:06.280 --> 00:07.480
- [screams]
- Jesus!

00:07.600 --> 00:08.600
Is this your daughter?

00:08.720 --> 00:10.840
Because she has
trashed my house.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.080
I didn't Mum, she's lying.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.880
I need her and her
bitch of a mother

00:14.000 --> 00:16.200
taught that you don'tmess with the West family.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.480
That's a fucking sexy name.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.280
And you are banned
from my dairy.

00:20.400 --> 00:23.160
I wouldn't go back in
there if you paid me.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.840
Well, it seems as thoughwe're rich, Mrs. West.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.040
Can we trust you?

00:27.160 --> 00:28.400
Well, you never
asked me that before.

00:28.520 --> 00:29.920
Yeah.Well, you're a prick this time.

00:30.040 --> 00:31.040
[loud slap]

00:31.160 --> 00:31.800
I won't be here
when you get home.

00:31.920 --> 00:32.720
[laughs]

00:32.840 --> 00:34.880
I've met someone.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.200
I'll help you unpack.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.400
You're not welcome here.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.040
I'm still the same
person, you know.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.200
Off you go.
Back to the sty.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.720
Oink, oink, oink.
[laughter]

00:42.840 --> 00:44.680
Better a pig
than a rat, Lefty.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.240
So don't you dare
try to deny it.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.480
Fucking bitch!

00:48.600 --> 00:51.080
You're all fools if
you trust Lefty Munroe.

00:55.520 --> 00:59.080
You lost the goddamn money?

00:59.200 --> 01:00.120
[screams]

01:00.240 --> 01:01.360
I know a job we can do.

01:01.480 --> 01:02.680
The two of us.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.080
I'd had enough of you.
You are dead to me.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.600
No, I'm not, Ted.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.360
When I throw you off thefucking edge you will be!

01:07.480 --> 01:08.560
We all make mistakes, Ted.

01:08.680 --> 01:09.840
Do you remember our first time?

01:09.960 --> 01:10.720
You remember that?

01:10.840 --> 01:12.160
[dogs barking]

01:12.280 --> 01:13.880
Thought you would
have pulled that out.

01:14.000 --> 01:14.920
You still owe me, Ted.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.040
[screams]

01:16.160 --> 01:17.200
We need to get
him to a hospital.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.560
One job to make it right.

01:24.360 --> 01:26.280
RITA: This is bullshit, Ted.

01:26.400 --> 01:27.800
Are you even listening to me?

01:27.920 --> 01:29.120
It's very hard not to, love.

01:29.240 --> 01:30.600
Tell him to go to hell.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.160
And then tell the boysthat he's stolen our money.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.440
No.
Lost.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.360
Not stolen.

01:34.480 --> 01:35.240
And not a word.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.320
Not until we get back.

01:36.440 --> 01:37.760
Our money, Ted.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.560
Lefty deserves a
chance to make it right.

01:40.680 --> 01:42.400
Or at least not as bad.

01:42.520 --> 01:43.680
Why?

01:43.800 --> 01:44.600
[sighs]

01:44.720 --> 01:46.720
Oh, Jesus, Ted.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.800
You did not still him.

01:48.920 --> 01:51.800
Not after all his bullshityear after bloody year.

01:51.920 --> 01:54.800
Yeah, Rita.
Year after bloody year.

01:54.920 --> 01:56.360
And yes, he fucked up.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.560
And he'll pay for it.

01:57.680 --> 01:59.720
He gets one last shot.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.000
He deserves that much.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.320
Not in my book.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.240
Well aware of that.

[music playing]

02:31.440 --> 02:37.520
[SINGING] Yesterday,
I was afraid of today.

02:40.640 --> 02:43.760
Getting me down.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.680
That was a game--

02:45.800 --> 02:47.600
[inaudible]

02:47.720 --> 02:48.800
Rita.

02:48.920 --> 02:50.840
Oh, it's your
boy's first, is it?

02:50.960 --> 02:52.560
This is Wolf.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.760
And this is Desiree, right?

02:54.880 --> 02:56.000
She's been here a year.

02:56.120 --> 02:57.720
The teachers think she's gifted.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.040
Nice for you.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.240
Well, why don't you
two run along and play.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.360
Give us a chance to catch up.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.800
Go, love.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.440
He doesn't like girls much.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.360
I'm sure that'll change.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.760
[laughs]

03:08.880 --> 03:10.160
How's Theodore?

03:10.280 --> 03:11.160
He's fine.

03:11.280 --> 03:12.080
Thanks.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.200
Does he have a job now?

03:13.320 --> 03:14.080
He does.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.160
Locksmith.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.760
What about Russell?

03:16.880 --> 03:17.880
Oh, working at
the post office.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.640
An accounts clerk.

03:19.760 --> 03:20.600
Sounds rash.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.760
Oh, has excellent prospects.

03:22.880 --> 03:24.440
Sure it does.

03:24.560 --> 03:27.200
You know, we should gettogether sometime for a catch

03:27.320 --> 03:28.440
up, the four of us.

03:28.560 --> 03:31.320
It's a great idea.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.920
Wolf, for heaven's sakes!

03:33.040 --> 03:34.640
Desiree, put your dress down.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.240
Get your hand out of
your pants, young man.

03:37.360 --> 03:38.200
[door opens and closes]

03:38.320 --> 03:41.560
[footsteps]

03:41.680 --> 03:44.480
The take from Eric's lastroad trip was light again.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.160
[sighs] What else is new?

03:46.280 --> 03:47.880
I can't tell if he'sdeliberately taking the money

03:48.000 --> 03:49.200
or if he's just useless.

03:49.320 --> 03:50.640
I'd guess the latter.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.360
There's a bit of thatgoing round at the moment.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.000
Oh, you should
give him the flick.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.920
Probably.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.080
Do you think McArthy'dfancy a bit of moonlighting?

03:58.200 --> 04:01.720
To driving stolen goods
around the North Island?

04:01.840 --> 04:03.280
That would help.

04:03.400 --> 04:07.880
Oh, do I detect a whiff oftrouble in Peggy paradise?

04:08.000 --> 04:08.760
Not at all.

04:08.880 --> 04:12.200
It sounded like it to me.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.120
Just recalling how,
for all his millions

04:15.240 --> 04:18.640
of faults, with Lefty, it wasalways money, or most the time.

04:18.760 --> 04:23.000
Can't be easy, raising yourgirls on an oinker's salary.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.360
Mike earns a very
good salary, actually.

04:25.480 --> 04:26.720
And I earn money, too.

04:26.840 --> 04:28.480
Just not quite enough
to keep you in the style

04:28.600 --> 04:29.840
to which you're accustomed.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.160
And I'm not giving you a raise.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.920
I wasn't asking for one.

04:33.040 --> 04:37.800
And Mike and I are just fine,thank you very much for asking.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.080
I might need to pop away early.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.320
We've got people coming
round for dinner.

04:40.440 --> 04:41.520
And I need to get a roast on.

04:41.640 --> 04:44.000
Well, la-de-dah,
aren't you flash?

04:49.560 --> 04:50.360
Oh, hi.

04:50.480 --> 04:51.280
Did you talk to your boss?

04:51.400 --> 04:52.480
Yeah.
No dice.

04:52.600 --> 04:53.680
Sorry.

04:53.800 --> 04:54.800
Oh, they don't
realize how bloody good

04:54.920 --> 04:55.880
you are at your job.
- Yeah.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.480
I-- how's your day?

04:57.600 --> 04:58.640
You're looking at it.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.240
Did Desiree get
back to school OK?

05:00.360 --> 05:01.240
Yes.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.000
She settled straight back in.

05:03.120 --> 05:06.680
You'll never guess who I raninto today at the school.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.920
Rachel West.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.760
Jeepers.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.320
Rita.

05:12.440 --> 05:13.840
Her boy just started today.Wolf.

05:13.960 --> 05:15.200
Wolf?

05:15.320 --> 05:16.400
What the heck kind of
name is that for a kid?

05:16.520 --> 05:18.040
[laughs] I know.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.240
So she's still
with Theodore then?

05:19.360 --> 05:20.520
Yes.

05:20.640 --> 05:21.880
I thought they'd
be long split by now.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.440
All living in somecommune in the Coromandel.

05:23.560 --> 05:24.800
[laughs] Or in prison.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.120
Or that.

05:26.240 --> 05:29.800
[laughs] You know,
Theodore's actually a--

05:29.920 --> 05:31.880
he's a locksmith now.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.160
Really?

05:33.280 --> 05:34.720
I thought he might
be worth talking to.

05:34.840 --> 05:37.520
About that thing that youand Bill were talking about.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.480
That was just me and himtalking after a few beers.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.000
Yeah.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.960
But if you wanted to makeit more than just talking,

05:43.080 --> 05:45.280
a locksmith would be goodto bring on board, right?

05:45.400 --> 05:48.440
And Theodore, I'm sure yourecall, was no fan of the law.

05:48.560 --> 05:56.920
[door opens and closes]

05:57.040 --> 05:57.920
[urinating]

05:59.040 --> 05:59.840

05:59.960 --> 06:01.080
What?

06:01.200 --> 06:02.440
Having a piss in the
middle of nowhere.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.280
The road trips we've been on?

06:04.400 --> 06:05.880
Come on.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.640
You hated road trips for along time after that first one.

06:08.760 --> 06:09.760
Can you blame me?

06:09.880 --> 06:11.280
I believe your
exact words were,

06:11.400 --> 06:14.160
everything south of theBombays can go fuck themselves.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.000
I think it's good
it's just you and me.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.360
Yeah.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.320
Because the others would
kill you if they knew.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.760
This will soften the blow.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.080
You hope.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.800
Don't start thinking
I'm happy about this.

06:25.920 --> 06:26.920
Yeah.
I get that.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.080
Is this guy a
bit of the asshole

06:28.200 --> 06:29.840
you say he is, I
don't like stealing

06:29.960 --> 06:31.320
from hardworking Kiwis.

06:31.440 --> 06:32.760
Trust me, Ted.

06:32.880 --> 06:35.120
This bloke is right upyour alley, asshole-wise.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.640
You know what I mean.

06:36.760 --> 06:40.560
The moment I saw him, Ithought, Ted will love this guy.

06:40.680 --> 06:41.560
And you're sure he's loaded.

06:41.680 --> 06:42.920
Oh, yeah.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.600
Just because he flashes
the cash doesn't mean

06:44.720 --> 06:46.520
it's worth driving halfway downthe bloody country to rob him.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.160
Hey, I've put in the work.

[SINGING] Let's think ofsomething we can talk about.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.920
Let's think of something--

07:00.040 --> 07:01.120
It was delicious, Ngaire.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.280
Oh, never in [inaudible].

07:03.400 --> 07:04.480
French, is it?

07:04.600 --> 07:05.720
Brian Kerr, from
one of his books.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.200
I like a good piece of mutton.

07:07.320 --> 07:08.120
[laughs]

07:08.240 --> 07:09.040
[doorbell rings]

07:09.160 --> 07:10.880
I'll get it.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.440
Russell's lucky to bemarried to such a great cook.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.160
Oh, I should
hope he thinks so.

07:16.280 --> 07:19.200
Rita, Theodore, this is
a friend of ours, Bill.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.760
Oh, good to meet
you, Theodore.

07:20.880 --> 07:22.000
Oh, everyone calls me Ted.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.160
And everyone but
Russel calls me Bilkey.

07:24.280 --> 07:26.400
Is it OK if Bill and
I borrow Ted for a bit?

07:26.520 --> 07:28.040
Just something to run past you.- Yeah.

07:28.160 --> 07:28.840
Sure.
I'm all ears.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.560
Won't be long, love.

07:30.680 --> 07:32.160
Take all the time you need.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.080
We might have a sherry.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.360
Rita?

07:34.480 --> 07:36.800
Sherry would be lovely.

07:36.920 --> 07:37.720
Cheers.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.360
Bill's had some bad news.

07:39.480 --> 07:40.920
Just been called up.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.160
Oh, lousy luck.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.160
Tell me about it.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.600
It's just bloody wrong.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.440
Holyoke, you know, sendingour boys off to Vietnam

07:47.560 --> 07:48.640
to fight for the Yanks.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.240
You're not a fan
of the Nats, Ted?

07:50.360 --> 07:51.520
Well, like I
say, I'm a coaster.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.160
Labor through and through.

07:53.280 --> 07:54.840
The guys I know, I
went to school with,

07:54.960 --> 07:56.560
died in the Strongman Mine.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.520
Now the government's
trying to cover it up

07:58.640 --> 08:00.360
with the so-called
inquiry, the bastards.

08:03.760 --> 08:04.560
Oh.

08:04.680 --> 08:05.760
Sorry, mate.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.160
What for?

08:07.280 --> 08:09.040
Well, you know, youwork for the post office.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.160
[laughs] Just
because I work for them

08:11.280 --> 08:13.000
doesn't mean I'm a fan.

08:13.120 --> 08:16.600
In fact, Bilkey and I wantto run an idea past you.

08:16.720 --> 08:19.280
It's not what
you'd call legal.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.840
But it could be
very profitable.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.120
Keep talking.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.800
It's about a project
we got on at work,

08:25.920 --> 08:28.640
the thing that happens
in July of this year.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.320
These are the new coins.

08:30.440 --> 08:35.520
One cent, two cents, five cents,10 cents, 20, and the 50 cents.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.480
You will be using these from--[SINGING] the 10th of July

08:39.600 --> 08:42.240
next year.

08:42.360 --> 08:44.280
The dismal
currency changeover.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.960
[music playing]

08:49.800 --> 08:51.320
Only me.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.880
Phineas is playing
squash and I was bored.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.080
So I thought I'd pop round.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.000
I've got tonic.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.680
I'm sure you've got gin.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.440
I do.

09:00.560 --> 09:03.160
And you said Ted had
gone away for a bit.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.040
He has.

09:04.160 --> 09:05.720
Yeah.

09:05.840 --> 09:09.400
So I thought you'd like somecompany being here on your own.

09:09.520 --> 09:10.720
[door closes]

09:10.840 --> 09:12.960
Yep, just me.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.320
So why is Phineas
playing squash?

09:15.440 --> 09:16.960
It's his new thing
for passing the time

09:17.080 --> 09:18.520
now he doesn't have to work.

09:18.640 --> 09:19.800
[door closes]

09:19.920 --> 09:21.400
Right.

09:21.520 --> 09:25.120
Well, I wouldn't
tell Phineas to get

09:25.240 --> 09:26.800
too attached to playing squash.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.160
Why not?

09:28.280 --> 09:30.400
I just don't
think it's his game.

09:30.520 --> 09:31.800
Me neither.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.680
I don't think he realizesit doesn't actually

09:33.800 --> 09:36.080
involve squashing people.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.400
Still, it helps him pass
the childless hours.

09:39.520 --> 09:40.920
The void.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.200
The emptiness of our housewithout the pitter-patter

09:43.320 --> 09:44.440
of little feet.

09:44.560 --> 09:48.200
Carol, where did
you buy this stuff?

09:48.320 --> 09:50.960
The Foursquare, why?

09:51.080 --> 09:55.880
Carol, you know I can tellwhen you're lying, right?

09:56.000 --> 09:56.800
[sighs] OK.

09:56.920 --> 09:57.680
Yes.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.200
The forbidden dairy.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.400
But only because I wasdriving past when I remembered

10:01.520 --> 10:03.080
I should bring something.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.960
I couldn't be bothered going allthe way back to the Foursquare.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.720
We agreed to not give
that woman our business.

10:06.840 --> 10:07.600
No.

10:07.720 --> 10:09.440
You said we couldn't.

10:09.560 --> 10:10.400
[door closes]

10:10.520 --> 10:11.720
Same difference.

10:11.840 --> 10:14.400
Trish is quite nice really.We got chatting.

10:14.520 --> 10:17.400
She's a cow, whosedaughters invaded my home.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.480
Trish is adamant
they wouldn't do that.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.360
She says her girls
are really smart

10:21.480 --> 10:22.720
and never do anything bad.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.080
[music playing]

10:25.480 --> 10:27.280
Why won't she introduce
us to her sisters?

10:27.400 --> 10:29.160
- Now it's a mystery, Sparky.- Yeah.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.520
You know, there's three of us.

10:30.640 --> 10:32.640
And she's got two sisters.

10:32.760 --> 10:35.160
I think you know
what I'm saying.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.720
- It's hard not to, Eric.- Yeah.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.400
[laughs]
- What about Falani?

10:38.520 --> 10:39.760
Oh, don't be [inaudible].

10:39.880 --> 10:41.680
[music playing]

10:44.720 --> 10:51.760
That family, those girls,they're nothing but trouble.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.400
You mark my words.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.000
But if we don't think big,we'll always be a small nation.

10:56.120 --> 10:57.520
But we are a small nation.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.360
But if we want to foot itwith the boys in the world

10:59.480 --> 11:01.080
by spending millions
and millions

11:01.200 --> 11:03.040
building smelters
and dams and such

11:03.160 --> 11:04.720
like, I mean, can
we afford that?

11:04.840 --> 11:07.000
Well, if we don't we'll alwaysbe at the hands of the Arabs,

11:07.120 --> 11:08.680
every time they want toput up the price of petrol.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.600
Do you really think
this whole natural gas

11:10.720 --> 11:11.480
line is the way to go?

11:11.600 --> 11:12.800
Yes, I do, Mike.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.520
I really do.I think the government's right.

11:14.640 --> 11:15.840
I think we've got to think big.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.480
Oh, you like thinking
big, do you, Wendy?

11:18.600 --> 11:20.080
I-- I support
what they're doing.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.360
Yes.
- No.

11:21.480 --> 11:24.040
I meant in general.
You like big things?

11:26.880 --> 11:27.880
I don't know what you mean?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.480
Oh, if that's
the case, you must

11:29.600 --> 11:32.960
have been very disappointedwhen you shaved my husband.

11:33.080 --> 11:34.800
Lefty.
You remember him.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.840
Tiny cock, one ball
short of a full sac.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.040
Yes.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.440
I remember your
husband, but we nev--

11:41.560 --> 11:43.080
Wendy wouldn't do
something like that.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.440
I can assure you.

11:44.560 --> 11:47.000
And I can assure you,
Brian, that Lefty would.

11:47.120 --> 11:47.920
And that she did.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.800
[music playing]

11:55.680 --> 11:59.240
Oh, but you know, therewere so many other women,

11:59.360 --> 12:01.480
possibly I'm getting confused.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.920
My apologies,
Wendy, if he didn't

12:03.040 --> 12:05.240
have his wicked way with you.

12:05.360 --> 12:06.960
My apologies if he did.

12:07.080 --> 12:08.600
[laughs] I'll put the coffee on.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.560
[footsteps]

12:12.320 --> 12:13.480
Sorry.

12:13.600 --> 12:18.440
The separation hasn't
been easy for her.

12:18.560 --> 12:22.400
Oh, god, I hate this bed.

12:22.520 --> 12:23.320
Yeah.

12:23.440 --> 12:24.800
It's not the best, eh?

12:31.240 --> 12:32.120
I'm sorry.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.040
What for?

12:33.160 --> 12:34.360
For being a bitch.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.480
No.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.200
You weren't a bitch.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.240
If I'd known she'd
shagged Lefty,

12:39.360 --> 12:41.200
I never would have
invited them round.

12:41.320 --> 12:42.520
Don't get me wrong.

12:42.640 --> 12:43.720
I'm not a fan of the
guy, as you well know,

12:43.840 --> 12:44.920
but he was your
husband at the time.

12:45.040 --> 12:46.480
[laughs]

12:46.600 --> 12:47.800
What?

12:47.920 --> 12:50.080
Well, he was my husband
when you shagged me.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.520
Well, that's different.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.360
How?

12:53.480 --> 12:54.960
Because I love you.

12:55.080 --> 12:57.160
He was just looking for awarm place to stick his dick.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.040
[laughs]

12:58.160 --> 12:59.960
[music playing]

13:04.440 --> 13:05.760
[knock at door]

13:05.880 --> 13:06.720
[door opens]

13:09.240 --> 13:12.120
How's the room?

13:12.240 --> 13:13.840
It's all right.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.200
Good.
Good.

13:15.320 --> 13:16.440
Yeah.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.240
Mine's good, too.

13:18.360 --> 13:19.880
Oh, I went to the bottle store.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.080
Got a little something to saythanks for sticking with me.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.480
You're welcome.

13:26.600 --> 13:27.480
[door closes]

13:31.400 --> 13:32.400
Thanks, love.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.400
Sing out if you
need another cup.

13:38.760 --> 13:39.800
[door closes]

13:39.920 --> 13:41.760
It's called
Operation Overlander.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.400
And what they need to
do is move $120 million

13:44.520 --> 13:47.120
in the new currency
round the country

13:47.240 --> 13:50.240
in time for it to go intocirculation on July 18, right?

13:50.360 --> 13:51.320
And you want to steal it.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.000
Well, not all of it.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.960
Because that would be stealingall the money in New Zealand.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.480
700,000 of which is in coins.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.280
You might as well
think big there, right?

13:59.400 --> 14:00.880
Maybe one day.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.600
For now, the money's sent aroundthe country on six trains.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.240
Presumably well
guarded trains.

14:05.360 --> 14:08.920
Two plotters in every car,two dog squads on every train.

14:09.040 --> 14:12.120
All escorted by the army.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.160
How is it that you
know all of this?

14:14.280 --> 14:15.880
I work for the
post office, Ted.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.120
Very little happens
in this country

14:17.240 --> 14:18.440
that we don't know about.

14:18.560 --> 14:19.640
And I've befriended
a chap who works

14:19.760 --> 14:21.760
for the Decimal Currency Board.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.640
But don't worry
about the trains.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.320
Because what we're interestedin is once the cash leaves

14:26.440 --> 14:29.120
the trains, it
goes to 592 banks,

14:29.240 --> 14:31.080
to go into circulation
on July 10.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.840
Which means on
July 9, there will

14:32.960 --> 14:34.400
be many banks hefty with cash.

14:34.520 --> 14:35.400
[doorbell rings]

14:36.520 --> 14:38.440
Can you get that, love?

14:38.560 --> 14:40.800
Exactly.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.400
You want to hit
one of these banks?

14:42.520 --> 14:43.280
Yeah.

14:52.960 --> 14:56.080
We'll need three of us
on the inside, at least.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.520
And we'll need a driverunless that's one of you two.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.240
There's a guy I know out inthe garage, races stock cars.

15:01.360 --> 15:02.160
Sounds OK so far.

15:02.280 --> 15:03.800
He's mary.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.640
I don't care what he is,as long as he can drive.

15:05.760 --> 15:09.600
You ought to know, Mr. Munroe,if I hadn't known you better,

15:09.720 --> 15:11.160
I'd say the job you're
talking about here

15:11.280 --> 15:13.280
sounds pretty damn illegal.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.720
But are you interested
is all we want to know.

15:15.840 --> 15:16.960
But I'm a good boy.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.160
And doing crime,
that would be a--

15:19.280 --> 15:20.920
a bad thing.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.320
Well, then, forget
we ever spoke, eh?

15:23.440 --> 15:24.240
You never saw me.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.720
Afternoon.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.000
Either of you two work here?

15:31.120 --> 15:32.280
Eh?
- Yeah.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.280
Yeah.
I do.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.000
What can I help you with?

15:35.120 --> 15:37.360
Mary feller, goes by thename of Burt Armstrong.

15:37.480 --> 15:38.480
He work here?
- Oh, that guy.

15:38.600 --> 15:39.400
Yeah.

15:39.520 --> 15:40.400
No, he was trouble.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.880
We had to let him go--
what?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.360
A few months back.
Why?

15:43.480 --> 15:45.040
I need to talk to him
about some stolen cars.

15:45.160 --> 15:47.480
Ah.
Doesn't surprise me.

15:47.600 --> 15:50.200
But like I said, he
shot through on us.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.640
You're welcome to look
around if you like.

15:51.760 --> 15:52.520
Nah, nah.

15:52.640 --> 15:53.760
She's good.

15:53.880 --> 15:54.960
But if you do see
him, give me a call.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.520
McArthy, Constable Mike McArthy.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.000
- Good to meet you, Mike.- Thanks for your help.

15:59.120 --> 15:59.920
Welcome.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.400
What's that you were sayingabout being a good boy?

16:04.520 --> 16:05.960
What was that you
were saying about a job?

16:06.080 --> 16:06.840
[door opens]

16:06.960 --> 16:08.440
Sorry, there's a problem.

16:08.560 --> 16:09.440
Can you deal with it?

16:09.560 --> 16:12.560
No, not really.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.080
I'm here for the TV.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.200
I explained to them I'dcatch the payments next month.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.440
But that was three months ago.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.200
So they've sent me
to take the TV back.

16:19.320 --> 16:20.360
I have three kids.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.920
And the girls,
they love their TV.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.360
I don't know
anything about kids.

16:23.480 --> 16:24.960
I was just told to
get the TV back.

16:27.800 --> 16:31.320
Phineas, isn't it?

16:31.440 --> 16:32.720
Phineas O'Driscoll.

16:32.840 --> 16:35.280
I've seen you box
on Friday nights.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.200
Yeah.

16:36.320 --> 16:37.400
So?

16:37.520 --> 16:39.280
Your Mummy watches you.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.880
She likes it when
I beat them up.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.960
[laughs] And does she knowthat you're here doing this?

16:46.080 --> 16:48.240
Trying to take away the
things that these people

16:48.360 --> 16:49.600
have worked hard for?

You know, like-- like
Russell and Ngaire here.

And I won't have a job.

16:56.800 --> 17:00.680

Make more money than
you've ever dreamed of.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.200
In a manner of speaking.

17:27.320 --> 17:28.680
Lady, if you have
a problem with us

17:28.800 --> 17:30.400
and our lifestyle, then theonly thing I can suggest

17:30.520 --> 17:32.560
is that you sell up
and move because we're

17:32.680 --> 17:34.520
not going anywhere in a hurry.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.320

18:11.640 --> 18:13.040
That's all right.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.920
Anything that gets Eric toleave is doing me a favor.

Don't see you in

clothes shopping.

18:20.640 --> 18:21.960
Bilkey's fitting him for a suit.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.080
Does Phineas really
need an new suit, Carol?

18:26.200 --> 18:27.480
That's what I keep saying.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.800
But he looks nice in a suit.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.240
Yeah.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.320
But you might want tothink about it for a while

18:32.440 --> 18:33.800
before you spend all that money.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.840
But that's the thingabout having lots of money.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.160
You can buy things
because you want

18:37.280 --> 18:40.680
to, not because you need to.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.760
About bloody time.

What if what I said toyou gets back to McArthy?

18:56.800 --> 18:58.560
Oh, like if you said, hello.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.240
Oh, well then I'd tell him
that Phineas said hello.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.480
We should probably go, love.

So what now?

19:45.760 --> 19:48.560
Are we just meant to sit
by the fire and wait?

19:48.680 --> 19:49.440
I guess so.

26:40.680 --> 26:41.760
It's all under control.

26:41.880 --> 26:43.040
We're just testing the alarm.Yeah.

26:43.160 --> 26:44.480
Just keep walking through.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.000
It'll be off in a moment.Don't worry about it.

26:48.520 --> 26:51.840
[clang and creaking]

26:51.960 --> 26:53.800
Get them in the van.

26:53.920 --> 26:55.320
Why aren't we
taking the corners?

26:55.440 --> 26:56.560
Because the
notes are in there.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.000
Yeah.
But I can crack that.

26:58.120 --> 26:59.480
We haven't got time.

26:59.600 --> 27:00.640
[laughs] Well, I didn'tcome here for bloody coins.

27:00.760 --> 27:02.200
All these boxes
are worth hundreds.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.160
Maybe thousands.

27:04.280 --> 27:05.040
Ah!

27:05.160 --> 27:07.520
[music playing]

27:23.800 --> 27:24.840
About bloody time.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.960
Lefty, this isn't money.

27:32.080 --> 27:36.520
Unless there's money hiddenbehind the insane drivel.

27:36.640 --> 27:39.120
Oh, apparently the Sovietinvasion of Afghanistan

27:39.240 --> 27:43.160
is a sign of the coming of thebeast, as is the rolling, as is

27:43.280 --> 27:44.200
Ronald Reagan.
Who knew?

27:44.320 --> 27:45.440
- Fuck!

27:45.560 --> 27:46.480
I couldn't have put
it better myself.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.960
[music playing]

27:55.560 --> 27:56.680
Ted, forget it.

27:56.800 --> 27:57.680
We have to go.

27:57.800 --> 27:58.840
I'm here for the bloody money.

27:58.960 --> 28:00.120
This is the bloody money.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.600
I'm not pissing around
with small change.

28:01.720 --> 28:02.520
This is my gig.

28:02.640 --> 28:03.640
My job.

28:03.760 --> 28:04.680

28:04.800 --> 28:05.680

28:11.920 --> 28:12.720
Fuck!

28:16.280 --> 28:17.480

28:17.600 --> 28:18.800
I thought you said
they were miles away!

28:18.920 --> 28:19.680

28:19.800 --> 28:21.720
But they're not, are they?

28:21.840 --> 28:22.720

28:26.240 --> 28:28.080

28:33.120 --> 28:34.600
We have to fucking go.

28:34.720 --> 28:35.880
Now!

28:36.000 --> 28:36.800
If you're going to
do a job like this,

28:36.920 --> 28:38.560
you do bloody properly.

28:38.680 --> 28:39.760
Make it worth our fucking while.

28:39.880 --> 28:42.040
And if you get
greedy, you get caught.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.120
This is bloody typical of you.

28:43.240 --> 28:44.040
He's got money.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.040
I know it.

28:45.160 --> 28:46.000
Just not in the fucking safe.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.720
Get real, Lefty.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.720
Just because you don't havethe balls to take the rest.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.200
No.I've got the balls, all right.

28:51.320 --> 28:52.800
Ask Rita.

28:52.920 --> 28:54.400
You leave my wife out of this.

28:54.520 --> 28:55.440
I was there first, mate.

28:55.560 --> 28:56.360
Just saying.

28:56.480 --> 28:57.800
The cops are coming.

28:57.920 --> 28:58.720

We go now.

28:59.760 --> 29:01.960
[music playing]

29:05.240 --> 29:07.080
You know what?
You had your shot.

29:07.200 --> 29:08.320
You've had plenty of shots.

29:08.440 --> 29:09.840
But this is it, mate.
You're gone.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.120
You are out.

29:11.240 --> 29:13.280
Which is what you
wanted all along, eh?

29:13.400 --> 29:14.480

29:14.600 --> 29:15.880

29:16.000 --> 29:16.880

29:17.000 --> 29:19.280
I bloody suffered to save you.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.520
And what did I
get in return, eh?

29:21.640 --> 29:23.720

[tires screeching]

29:41.960 --> 29:43.120
We can't.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.360
There's too much weight
on the back axle.

29:44.480 --> 29:45.480
The tires are
hitting the arches.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.080
Have we thought this through?

29:47.200 --> 29:48.640
We need to lighten the loador move the coins up front.

29:48.760 --> 29:49.680
We haven't got time for that.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.040
Well, then we're fucked.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.760
I'm gonna leave
and take my chances.

29:52.880 --> 29:54.560
I'll meet you where weagreed if we got split up.

30:05.080 --> 30:07.040
Give me one good reason whyI shouldn't shoot both of you

30:07.160 --> 30:07.960
right now.

30:08.080 --> 30:09.840
[grunting]

30:12.360 --> 30:14.320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:14.440 --> 30:16.640
One of two things happens now.

30:16.760 --> 30:21.200
One, I shoot you for breakingin and attacking my husband.

30:21.320 --> 30:25.440
Two, we split the money
50/50-- fair deal.

30:25.560 --> 30:26.600
And then you drive
me to Auckland,

30:26.720 --> 30:27.920
away from this fuck knuckle.

30:28.040 --> 30:29.960
But you mean there is money?

30:30.080 --> 30:32.360
Oh, yeah.

30:32.480 --> 30:35.200
Well then, two, right?

30:35.320 --> 30:36.120
Definitely two.

30:36.240 --> 30:39.360
Yeah, two.

30:39.480 --> 30:41.720
But if you think you'rehaving your way with me again.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.360
Hang on.

30:43.480 --> 30:44.520
Strictly speaking, you werethe one who had your way with--

30:44.640 --> 30:45.400
Yeah, yes, Lefty.
We're good.

30:45.520 --> 30:46.400
We're good, OK?
Deal.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.720
When we get to
Auckland, you will take

31:19.840 --> 31:21.880
me to where my true love lives.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.240
His name is Hong.

31:23.360 --> 31:24.480
Do you know him?

31:24.600 --> 31:25.720
Doesn't ring a bell.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.680
He lives in a place
called Henderson.

31:27.800 --> 31:30.560
With this money, we willstart many great businesses.

31:30.680 --> 31:33.080
And I shall be Mrs. Hong.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.520
That's nice.

31:34.640 --> 31:37.520
I meant to ask, how comeyou only got one ball?

31:37.640 --> 31:38.400
It's a long story.

31:42.560 --> 31:45.200
They got caught?

31:45.320 --> 31:46.440
They must have.

31:46.560 --> 31:47.880
I don't know.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.360
Ted looked pretty handy,like he'd know what to do.

31:49.480 --> 31:52.720
I wish he came before
the cops came after us.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.760
What about them?

31:54.880 --> 31:56.720
[yelling]

32:09.600 --> 32:11.440
Take him.

32:11.560 --> 32:13.400

Uh, it wasn't pretty.

We have to go over the fence.

32:18.120 --> 32:19.400
Dog's too close.
You go.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.400
I'll hold it off.

32:20.520 --> 32:21.760
I know how to deal with dogs.

32:21.880 --> 32:22.840
I thought you'd been arrested.

32:22.960 --> 32:24.400
My dog, my responsibility.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.400
I won't give anyone
up. [SHOUTING] Go.

32:26.520 --> 32:27.320

33:11.160 --> 33:13.800
But the universe sure
had it in for him.

33:13.920 --> 33:15.760
OK, come on.

34:06.040 --> 34:09.280
We need to get

34:09.400 --> 34:11.600

34:11.720 --> 34:12.720
We got you.

34:12.840 --> 34:14.080
You're gonna be OK.

34:14.200 --> 34:16.480
You're gonna be rich, man.

34:16.600 --> 34:17.920
We did it.

34:18.040 --> 34:19.880

34:27.240 --> 34:28.720
I'll see you later.

34:28.840 --> 34:30.120

34:30.240 --> 34:31.040

You're back.

34:40.600 --> 34:41.440
Yep.

34:41.560 --> 34:42.480

34:42.600 --> 34:45.920
And him and the

34:46.040 --> 34:47.680
Looking forward to it already.

34:51.400 --> 34:52.600
Girls get off to school?

34:52.720 --> 34:54.520
- Yes.
- You're right.

34:54.640 --> 34:55.960
About what?

34:56.080 --> 34:57.360
This bed.

34:57.480 --> 34:59.000
Whoever invented the
waterbed should be shot.

34:59.120 --> 35:00.360
Yes.

35:00.480 --> 35:01.400
Well, we'll just have
to make do, won't we?

35:04.400 --> 35:05.720

35:05.840 --> 35:06.680
Come with me.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.520
You know that I love you, right?

35:12.640 --> 35:13.920
Of course.

35:14.040 --> 35:15.520
And I wish that I could
give you and the girls

35:15.640 --> 35:16.600
everything you want.

35:16.720 --> 35:17.920
I know.

35:18.040 --> 35:21.440
So you might as
well have this.

35:21.560 --> 35:23.760
It's American.

35:23.880 --> 35:25.400
I can see that.

35:25.520 --> 35:26.680
It's from Lefty.

35:26.800 --> 35:27.640
[grunting]

35:27.760 --> 35:28.640
What?

35:28.760 --> 35:31.080
You just fuck my wife, do you?

35:31.200 --> 35:32.560
[grunting]

35:39.520 --> 35:43.080
I presume it's
stolen, but I'm buggered

35:43.200 --> 35:44.520
if I can figure out from where.

35:49.360 --> 35:51.360
If you think I can help
you with some sort of--

35:51.480 --> 35:52.360
No.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.920
I would never ask that of you.

35:54.040 --> 35:56.160
You know that.

35:56.280 --> 36:00.560
I just figure, well, there'sno one missing that money.

36:00.680 --> 36:04.920
So you might as well haveit, if it makes you happy.

36:05.040 --> 36:09.200
Because like I say, I love you.

36:09.320 --> 36:10.360
And we need a new bed.

36:17.360 --> 36:22.240
And we will put
that bed to great use.

36:25.320 --> 36:29.120
You have my word.

36:29.240 --> 36:31.080
Here you are, love.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.720
Thank you.

36:32.840 --> 36:33.640
You're late.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.560
You know that thing Isaid about the [inaudible]??

36:39.680 --> 36:41.720
Well, just forget I spoke.

36:41.840 --> 36:42.920
I already did.

36:43.040 --> 36:45.040
Good.

36:45.160 --> 36:46.840
[humming]

36:46.960 --> 36:50.840
Why are you suddenly happy?

36:50.960 --> 36:52.560
The love of a good man, Rita.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.000
We don't get it all at once?

36:59.120 --> 37:00.120
No, Phineas.

37:00.240 --> 37:01.440
I'll use my job
at the post office

37:01.560 --> 37:03.720
to change the coins
into actual bank notes.

37:03.840 --> 37:05.120
But it'll take some time, OK?

37:05.240 --> 37:07.640
Just think of it
like a wage, Phineas.

37:07.760 --> 37:09.760
Do we get it in the new
money or the old money?

37:09.880 --> 37:10.880
Does it matter?

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
It's money, and we
bloody stole it.

37:13.120 --> 37:13.920
[laughter]

37:14.040 --> 37:15.200
Cheers.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.080
And it almost went
without a hitch.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.840
Except for me
almost fucking it up.

37:18.960 --> 37:20.240
Doesn't matter now.

37:20.360 --> 37:21.800
Well, it does to me.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.440
I owe you one.

37:23.560 --> 37:25.080
Interesting choice of wordsafter Lefty here losing a nut.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.760
Hey.
Don't call me Lefty.

37:26.880 --> 37:27.920
Well, that's what you are now.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.080
Yeah.
But I don't like it, OK?

37:29.200 --> 37:30.080
Well, you'll get used to it.

37:30.200 --> 37:32.040
[laughter]

37:33.480 --> 37:35.120
I suppose having a
boy is off the list now.

37:35.240 --> 37:36.120
No.

37:36.240 --> 37:37.360
Three girls is more than enough.

37:37.480 --> 37:38.800

38:02.760 --> 38:04.200
This isn't South Africa money.

38:04.320 --> 38:06.880
It's the job he and I did.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.640
Well, they're telling us.

38:09.760 --> 38:13.440
This is the money we'regetting instead of the rest

38:13.560 --> 38:14.360
of the South Africa money.

38:14.480 --> 38:17.760
Because that money is gone.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.720
Gone where?

38:19.840 --> 38:21.320
Gone gone.

38:21.440 --> 38:23.760
How can it be gone?

38:23.880 --> 38:26.000

38:26.120 --> 38:28.000

38:28.120 --> 38:29.040
He didn't steal the money.

38:29.160 --> 38:30.080

38:36.360 --> 38:39.200

38:49.840 --> 38:51.240
It's gone, Phineas.

38:51.360 --> 38:53.960
Lefty here has lost it--

38:54.080 --> 38:56.040

38:56.160 --> 38:57.680
if he doesn't find it again.- It's gone.

38:57.800 --> 38:58.880
I can't get it back.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.240
Don't you think I
would if I could?

39:00.360 --> 39:02.480
[SHOUTING] I need that money.

39:02.600 --> 39:05.080

39:05.200 --> 39:07.160
I have money for you.

39:07.280 --> 39:08.040
Here.

39:13.480 --> 39:14.680
What the hell is this?

39:14.800 --> 39:18.400
It's the leftovers
from our very first job.

39:18.520 --> 39:19.920
You remember that?

39:20.040 --> 39:22.240
That one didn't exactly goaccording to plan either,

39:22.360 --> 39:23.920
did it?

39:24.040 --> 39:27.600
And Lefty here sacrificed waymore than any of us that night.

39:27.720 --> 39:29.320
Do you remember?

39:29.440 --> 39:30.240
It was years ago.

39:30.360 --> 39:31.760
So?

39:31.880 --> 39:33.800
The point is it didn't goaccording to plan either.

39:33.920 --> 39:35.480
Shit.

39:35.600 --> 39:38.760
I was the one who almost cockedit up that night, from memory.

39:38.880 --> 39:39.640
We all make mistakes.

39:42.720 --> 39:44.120
Some of them are just
bigger than others.

39:44.240 --> 39:45.560
We got away with the
South African money.

39:45.680 --> 39:47.200
No, we didn't.

39:47.320 --> 39:50.080
No job's complete until thegetaway's done-- until the last

39:50.200 --> 39:52.360
of the money's in our hands.

39:52.480 --> 39:53.320
Yes.

39:53.440 --> 39:54.200
Lefty screwed up this time.

39:54.320 --> 39:55.360
Yes.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.960
We should all be
pissed off with him.

39:58.080 --> 40:00.040
But all this really meansis we have to get back

40:00.160 --> 40:01.920
to work sooner than we thought.

40:02.040 --> 40:06.120
We have to get back to doingwhat we do best, as a gang.

40:09.680 --> 40:11.000
OK?

40:11.120 --> 40:12.000
Yeah.

40:12.120 --> 40:12.920
OK.

40:13.040 --> 40:16.080
Do we get that?

40:16.200 --> 40:18.360
Yeah.

40:18.480 --> 40:19.280
Are we cool with that?

40:25.880 --> 40:26.760
Yeah.

40:30.880 --> 40:32.360
