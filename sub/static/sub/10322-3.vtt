WELL, THAT'S WHAT
WE DO AT THE MOTEL
WHEN WAXIN' WILMA'S MUSTACHE.

00:10.478 --> 00:14.548
THANKS FOR DOING THIS, GUYS.
MY HUSBAND SAID IT'S LIKE
FRENCH-KISSING HIS BROTHER FRED.

00:14.615 --> 00:17.618
NO PROBLEM, WILMA. MAYBE
SOMEDAY, I'LL NEED UNWANTED
HAIR RIPPED OFF MY BODY,

00:17.685 --> 00:19.987
AND YOU'LL BE THE ONE
TO HOLD ME DOWN.

OUR NEW STUDENT, MAGGIE LESTER.

UNFORTUNATELY FOR MAGGIE,

THE BIGGEST STAR ON TV,

THE BIGGEST JERK IN MY CLASS.

THE MUSTACHE ON THIS GIRL.

OH. BOTH NAMES
HAVE TO BE ON THE SAME LINE.

01:12.940 --> 01:16.076
I FEEL BAD
FOR THIS MAGGIE LESTER.
CHILDREN CAN BE VERY CRUEL.

01:16.144 --> 01:19.247
IN MY VILLAGE,
THEY USED TO LAUGH
AND CALL ME CHUPA CHUPS.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.815
THAT SOUNDS CUTE.
IT WAS NOT CUTE.

I HAD A BIG HEAD
AND A LITTLE BODY.

WHILE I WAS TRACKIN' DOWN
MY OLD CLASSMATE MAGGIE,

JOY WAS DEALIN' WITH A SITUATION
FROM HER MORE RECENT PAST.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.932
BABY, I LOVE THAT
SPRAY-ON STOCKING STUFF.

01:38.999 --> 01:42.236
IT MAKES YOUR LEGS
LOOK HOT, AND IT
MAKES ME A LITTLE HIGH.

01:42.303 --> 01:45.973
AND THAT'S EXACTLY HOW
I WANT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER
TO FEEL WHEN I MEET HIM TODAY.

01:46.039 --> 01:49.710
I WANT HIM TO THINK
IF HE GETS ME OFF,
I'LL RETURN THE FAVOR.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.679
DAMN IT!
I GOT LATINA.

RECENTLY, JOY HAD RUN
INTO SOME TROUBLE WITH THE LAW.

SHE WAS ARRESTED FOR
GRAND THEFT AUTO AND KIDNAPPIN'.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.853
IF CONVICTED,
IT WOULD BE HER THIRD STRIKE.

IF YOU CAN SEE MY THONG
WHEN I BEND OVER.

ALL ABOUT MY LIST.

03:13.126 --> 03:17.531
SO, UH, HOW CAN
I MAKE IT UP TO YOU?
WE COULD WAX YOUR FACE.

WE'LL WAX WHICHEVER.

IT'S OKAY, EARL.
I USED TO WAX
AND SHAVE AND PLUCK.

03:30.578 --> 03:35.015
AND I EVEN WORE A SKI MASK
FOR A WHILE, BUT IT MADE IT
IMPOSSIBLE TO GO TO THE BANK.

THIS IS JUST WHO I AM.
