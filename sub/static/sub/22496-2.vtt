00:34.901 --> 00:37.201
<b>7x02 - Link's Sausages</b>

00:37.702 --> 00:39.536
Gladys, it is time.

00:39.537 --> 00:43.206
Oh, no.
I'm not going out like a bitch.

00:43.274 --> 00:46.610
- Wha... what are you doing?
- Kicking your ass is what I'm doing.

00:46.677 --> 00:49.546
- No, you aren't. You're going out like a bitch.
- That's the thigh-master

00:49.614 --> 00:53.917
- [bleep] Oh, Reaper.
- Oh, Gladys.

00:53.985 --> 00:58.355
- Oh, Reaper.
- Grandma?

01:03.161 --> 01:05.562
Come on, come on.

01:05.630 --> 01:10.167
You're gonna flood the
engine. Don't pump the gas.

01:10.234 --> 01:15.338
Could be your carburetor. 
Pop the hood.

01:15.439 --> 01:19.819
- Try it again.
- Sounds like...

01:19.839 --> 01:24.814
- your carburetor.
- Just checked. Looks fine.

01:24.916 --> 01:28.919
- fuel pump, maybe.
- I could just call the auto club.

01:28.986 --> 01:31.922
Did you check the distributor cap?

01:32.023 --> 01:37.394
- It rained last night.
- Yep, there's water in it. Okay, try it now.

01:37.495 --> 01:41.331
You fixed it. Wow, thank you.

01:41.399 --> 01:45.691
So, you know what we're
gonna do now, right?

01:45.829 --> 01:50.800
- Whoo! Best night ever!
- Best friends ever.

01:50.801 --> 01:56.046
- Best ice cream ever.
- You guys got anywhere to be?

01:56.047 --> 01:58.848
- Actually...
- Yeah, right here.

01:58.916 --> 02:02.786
Let's cruise.

02:04.755 --> 02:07.457
Drop your weapon.
You have five seconds to comply.

02:07.558 --> 02:12.562
You have four seconds to comply.

02:12.663 --> 02:14.297
Get away from me!

02:16.601 --> 02:21.438
- Edward 209, what do you think you're doing?
- He didn't drop the gun, mama.

02:21.505 --> 02:24.447
- He did drop the gun.
- Aw, I'm sorry, mama.

02:24.448 --> 02:26.947
You're coming home with me now.

02:26.948 --> 02:29.446
You have five seconds to comply.

02:29.513 --> 02:34.384
- Okay, mama. You have four seconds to comply.
- But I said "okay, mama."

02:34.452 --> 02:38.154
- See how it feels, Edward?
- What the [bleep] is going on?

02:41.726 --> 02:43.093
- Bud.
- Why.

02:43.094 --> 02:45.829
Guys, I have cirrhosis of the liver.

02:45.896 --> 02:48.365
- Bud.
- Why?

02:48.432 --> 02:50.951
Because I have a drinking problem.

02:50.952 --> 02:53.470
Well, after crossing the freeway,

02:53.537 --> 02:57.094
base jumping off a cliff, and dodging
bullets in a gang war,

02:57.163 --> 03:03.013
- we finally found my reptar doll.
- Tommy, what are you doing in the street?

03:03.080 --> 03:05.915
Oh, thank god. They've been
lost for hours. Where were they?

03:05.983 --> 03:07.439
Stu, a word.

03:07.440 --> 03:10.353
<i>What the [bleep] Stu?</i>

03:10.454 --> 03:13.757
<i>- Well, I'm sorry. The babies escaped, and I ...
- Escaped?</i>

03:13.824 --> 03:17.560
<i>- They're babies, you sack-less moron.
- I was downstairs, working on</i>

03:17.628 --> 03:22.265
<i>- a new toy, and they just ...
- Oh, a new toy. Never mind, then.</i>

03:22.333 --> 03:24.868
<i>Didi, if you keep ridiculing my work,</i>

03:24.869 --> 03:27.404
<i>- I-I swear to god ...
- What? You'll hit me?</i>

03:27.471 --> 03:30.573
<i>- Ooh, you're such a man.
- Didi, stop.</i>

03:30.675 --> 03:34.297
<i>I'll be the man. 
See, Stu? I'm the man!</i>

03:34.332 --> 03:35.870
<i> I want a divorce.</i>

03:35.871 --> 03:38.948
These Al-Qaeda drivers are the best,
and they plan to smuggle

03:39.050 --> 03:42.919
- a nuclear device across the Mexican border.
- Gonna have to fight fire with fire.

03:42.987 --> 03:45.221
- You don't mean ...
- That's right.

03:45.289 --> 03:49.752
We're gonna need the baddest, brashest,
ballsiest hot-shit drivers in the world,

03:49.799 --> 03:52.364
and I know just the assholes.

04:09.580 --> 04:14.517
- Whoooo-ee.
- Your country needs you. You in?

04:14.618 --> 04:16.980
Me and uncle Sam, we haven't always

04:16.981 --> 04:20.523
- seen eye-to-eye.
- We want our records scrubbed clean.

04:20.624 --> 04:25.183
- Full pardons.
- One last job, and then we're out.

04:25.218 --> 04:27.530
I'm really confused,
and I want to go home.

04:27.598 --> 04:33.002
- Go team! 
- I-I-I-I don't

04:34.739 --> 04:38.808
Nice remote-control car, you eccentric bitch.

04:38.876 --> 04:43.580
- I'm gonna step on it.
- When people try to put me down, I use Punky power.

04:43.647 --> 04:46.950
- "Punky power"?
- It's what she calls

04:47.055 --> 04:51.421
- "believing in yourself."
- Actually, Punky power ... is this!

04:51.489 --> 04:55.058
Oh, no. I've heard of this.

04:55.126 --> 04:57.661
The elders in my world
spoke of the chosen one

04:57.662 --> 05:00.196
from Earth who would
possess ultimate power.

05:00.264 --> 05:05.718
<i>I will destroy the
world with Punky power.</i>

05:05.719 --> 05:07.537
Stop this, Punky.

05:07.638 --> 05:11.608
- Don't destroy the world.
- I was abandoned in a grocery store.

05:11.675 --> 05:15.478
<i>Why shouldn't I destroy the
world? It doesn't need me.</i>

05:15.546 --> 05:21.117
But I need you, Punky. You're like my real
daughter,  and I would never abandon you ...

05:21.185 --> 05:25.555
- Never!
- Do ... do you mean it?

05:25.623 --> 05:28.191
What should I do with the body?

05:28.259 --> 05:30.402
Who cares? She's not my real daughter.

05:30.584 --> 05:34.097
By the power of Grayskull...

05:34.165 --> 05:37.041
I have the power!

05:38.219 --> 05:40.103
<i>Hey, could you not have
the power at 3:00 A.M.?</i>

05:40.171 --> 05:43.551
<i>Some of us have to wake up in
three hours, for [bleep] sake.</i>

05:43.552 --> 05:45.241
Nothing more for you here,

05:45.309 --> 05:50.346
- Agent Starling. Fly, fly, fly.
- I bit my wrist.

05:50.414 --> 05:53.783
- Look at the blood!
- Agent Starling!

05:53.851 --> 05:56.820
Multiple miggs will suffer for that.
Buffalo Bill went by

05:56.887 --> 06:00.523
an alias once. Mofet.
M-o-f-e-t. Go now!

06:00.591 --> 06:03.693
- I really cut my wrists this time.
- Are you hurt?

06:03.794 --> 06:05.995
- Blammo!
- Agent Starling!

06:06.063 --> 06:09.799
I didn't think Miggs could manage again
so soon. The answer is in the file.

06:09.867 --> 06:14.137
- What does Buffalo Bill covet? Go now!
- You want to adopt a kitten?

06:14.205 --> 06:17.240
- Where'd you get a kitten?
- It's from my dick!

06:17.308 --> 06:20.043
Agent Starling!
Are you retarded, Agent Starling?

06:20.110 --> 06:23.546
Stop letting Miggs hit you with
his spooge. Look, Bill hates his own

06:23.647 --> 06:26.449
identity and he thinks that
makes him a transsexual. Go now!

06:26.517 --> 06:27.717
Want to see a magic trick?

06:27.718 --> 06:29.519
- Well, I like magic.
- Abracadabra!

06:29.587 --> 06:32.255
Agent Starling!
Miggs must have horse balls or

06:32.323 --> 06:34.224
something. I've never
seen anything like it.

06:34.291 --> 06:37.093
Look, Buffalo Bill wasn't born a killer.
He was made one through years

06:37.161 --> 06:40.263
of systematic abuse. Go now!
Agent Starling!

06:40.331 --> 06:42.432
The exit is right here.

06:44.969 --> 06:46.803
I don't think she's
gonna catch that guy.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.924
You know, Mr. Mayor,
more than just children

06:49.925 --> 06:52.475
celebrate Halloween. So
this year, why don't we cater

06:52.543 --> 06:56.145

To think, you've found a way
to stock enough food and oxygen

07:48.112 --> 07:50.577

07:51.676 --> 07:55.238

Ohh, I don't want to have this debate
with you again, Evil-lyn.

08:16.226 --> 08:20.391
You're talking about cartoon evil, not
real-world evil, which is essentially

08:20.403 --> 08:24.534
- a heightened narcissism.
- Put it in your dissertation, professor.

08:24.602 --> 08:29.038

Mother[bleep]. When we blow

- it will cease to be the highest point in eternia.
- That seems like cutting off

08:41.085 --> 08:45.310
- your nose to spite your face.
- Well, I've done that, too, and I think the results speak

08:45.374 --> 08:49.192

"beast" and a little more "man."
