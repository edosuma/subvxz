00:02.628 --> 00:04.421
<i>NARRATOR: Previously on Prison</i> Break:

00:04.505 --> 00:08.050
I find it incumbent that you see
the inside of a prison cell, Mr. Scofield.

00:08.132 --> 00:10.552
SUCRE: Why you want to see Burrows
so bad anyhow?

00:10.636 --> 00:11.845
Because he's my brother.

00:11.929 --> 00:14.765
So you get yourself
tossed into Fox River with him?

00:14.848 --> 00:17.100
To what? Save him?

00:17.184 --> 00:20.312
Whoever it was that set me up wants me
in the ground as quickly as possible.

00:20.395 --> 00:21.605
Look, the closer it gets,

00:21.688 --> 00:24.775
the more I'm worried that the bottom
is gonna fall out of this whole thing.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.818
That's the son of a bitch
that fingered Abruzzi.

00:26.902 --> 00:29.613
<i>MAGGIO: Someone found Fibonacci.
ABRUZZI: Who was this someone?</i>

00:29.988 --> 00:31.281
Why did you hire him?

00:31.365 --> 00:34.868
Keep your friends close,
your enemies closer.

00:34.952 --> 00:37.621
They come at me, John,
I'm coming after you.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.997
I doubt it.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.460
- I'm getting you out of here.
- It's impossible.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.170
Not if you designed the place, it isn't.

00:45.254 --> 00:47.965
- You've seen the blueprints.
- Better than that.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.551
I've got them on me.

01:05.399 --> 01:08.735
You're anticipating every one of my moves
three moves in advance.

01:08.819 --> 01:11.446
You're a hell of a strategist, Fish.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.740
- You ever think about Boston?
- Sure.

01:13.824 --> 01:15.826
Think you'll ever see it again?

01:15.909 --> 01:19.246
I'm a 60-year-old man
with 60 years left on my ticket.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.666
- What do you think?
- I'm thinking about going.

01:23.166 --> 01:27.045
Now, there's going and there's going.
Which one do you mean?

01:27.838 --> 01:29.548
The one you think I mean.

01:33.218 --> 01:37.806
Three days inside and he's already
thinking about turning rabbit.

01:38.307 --> 01:41.560
It'll pass. It always does.

01:42.561 --> 01:44.855
Bigger things to worry about
at the moment.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.774
I've been in here long enough
to know it when I see it.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.985
The calm before the storm.

01:50.694 --> 01:54.072
Whites and blacks will go in
at each other real soon here.

01:54.197 --> 01:57.743
Everybody chooses sides
and a lot of guys bleed.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.202
There a reason?

01:59.494 --> 02:02.789
Same reason you don't put cats and dogs
in the same cage.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.708
They don't get along.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.061
(SINGING IN SPANISH)

02:35.364 --> 02:37.324
- What?
- Toilet won't flush.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.492
So?

02:38.992 --> 02:41.703
SUCRE: Means only one thing, Fish.
OFFICER: Shakedown!

02:46.083 --> 02:48.460
The dirt shuts down the water
so you can't flush your contraband.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.545
But you got nothing to worry about.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.172
Says who?

02:56.176 --> 02:58.053
Under <i>the</i> table, <i>cofio.</i>

03:02.140 --> 03:03.684
What the hell is this?

03:03.767 --> 03:06.436
It's insurance, white boy. Now dump it.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.275
Open it.

03:15.946 --> 03:19.533
So, tooling up for the race riot, are we?

03:20.617 --> 03:22.119
Hand it over.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.666
Rughead and the billies.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.669
Which side are you on, anyhow, Fish?

03:30.752 --> 03:32.337
That would be neither, boss.

03:32.421 --> 03:37.008
Maybe you're gonna go extracurricular
with it, then. Stick a CO, maybe.

03:37.801 --> 03:40.846
- Is there a problem here, Deputy?
- Got a shank in here.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.808
Is this yours?

03:53.525 --> 03:55.193
You're not a good liar.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.655
Come on, Sucre. You're going to the SHU.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.457
- Move along, Deputy.
- I'm not clone shaking his cell down yet.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.000
I said, move along.

04:14.629 --> 04:18.425
In the old man's back pocket, are you?
Well, I got news for you, Fish.

04:18.507 --> 04:22.721
He may run this place during the day,
but I run it during the night.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.890
What the hell are you thinking, Michael?

05:08.725 --> 05:11.603
- How are we doing it?
- The infirmary.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.563
Infirmary?

05:14.606 --> 05:17.400
It's the weakest link in the security chain.

05:17.484 --> 05:20.612
As long as I get that PUGNAc,
I'll get all the access I need.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.197
What the hell's a PUGNAc?

05:22.280 --> 05:25.158
It lowers my insulin levels
to the point that I'm hyperglycemia.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.619
As long as
the good doctor thinks I'm a diabetic,

05:27.702 --> 05:30.205
I'll have plenty of time in there
to do what I need to do.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.915
- Which is?
- A little work.

05:31.998 --> 05:35.627
A little prep for your arrival.
That's the idea, anyway.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.045
<i>The 'flea'?</i>

05:37.128 --> 05:40.006
There's a little hitch
in getting the PUGNAc, that's all.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.342
They don't exactly stock it
at the commissary.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.845
You telling me this whole thing is
riding on a bunch of pills?

05:44.928 --> 05:47.264
Someone's working on it as we speak.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.646
Now is not the time
to be trusting a black inmate, Michael.

05:54.729 --> 05:59.025
- Our relationship transcends race.
- Nothing transcends race in here.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.569
I can't let you do it.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.529
Good behavior,
you're out of here in three years.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.866
- Gonna be a whole lot sooner than that.
- It can't be done...

06:06.116 --> 06:08.785
It can't be done, Michael.
No one's ever broken out of Fox River.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.788
Every single step's already been
mapped out, every contingency.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.748
Every contingency?

06:13.832 --> 06:15.542
You may have the blueprints for this place,

06:15.625 --> 06:18.086
but there's one thing those plans
can't show you. People.

06:18.169 --> 06:19.254
Guys like Abruzzi.

06:19.337 --> 06:23.008
You so much as look at these oats
the wrong way, they'll out you up.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.968
As far as the rest of these guys
are concerned,

06:25.051 --> 06:28.430
I'm just another con doing his time,
staying out of trouble.

06:28.513 --> 06:31.099
You don't go looking for trouble in here,
it just finds you.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.101
And when it does, we'll be long gone.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.979
This is madness.
You can't even get out of your cell.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.314
Not true.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.150
- What, you got a key?
- Something like that.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.742
INMATE: Wrong piece of real estate, Fish.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.161
- Belongs to T-Bag.
- Who?

08:16.287 --> 08:18.206
You'd best speak with respect, Fish.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.959
Man kidnapped half a dozen boys
and girls down in 'Bama.

08:21.042 --> 08:24.546
Raped and killed them.
Wasn't always in that order either.

08:24.921 --> 08:28.216
- Does T-Bag have a real name?
- That is my real name.

08:32.053 --> 08:35.097
No, no, no, please. Sit.

08:37.475 --> 08:41.688
So you're the new one I've been
hearing all the rave reviews about.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.565
Scofield.

08:43.982 --> 08:47.235
One thing's for sure,
you're just as pretty as advertised.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.987
Prettier, even.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.576
- Rugheads got you scared, do they?
- Sorry?

08:54.659 --> 08:56.494
I assume that's why you're over here.

08:56.578 --> 08:59.956
A few days on the inside,
any God-fearing white man realizes

09:00.040 --> 09:02.292
the correctional system's got
a serious lean toward

09:02.375 --> 09:05.420
-the African-American persuasion.
- I hadn't noticed.

09:05.503 --> 09:08.631
They got the numbers, all right,
so they think they can do as they please.

09:08.715 --> 09:12.302
We got one thing they don't. Surprise.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.472
We're gonna take the ballgame
to them real soon.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.975
It's gonna be nasty for a first-timer
like you, but we'll protect you.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.479
I'll protect you. All you gotta do is

09:23.688 --> 09:27.567
take this pocket right here,
and your life'll be all peaches and cream.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.652
I walk, you walk with me.

09:29.736 --> 09:33.281
I'm gonna keep you real close
so no one up in here can hurt you.

09:33.448 --> 09:35.909
Looks to me you already got a girlfriend.

09:38.953 --> 09:41.581
I got a whole another pocket over here.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.333
L1lpass.

09:45.877 --> 09:49.005
I don't protect you,
them rugheads are gonna gobble you up

09:49.089 --> 09:51.633
-like a plate of black-eyed peas.
- I said no.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.760
Then you best move, then.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.637
Now.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.185
You come around these bleachers again,

10:02.268 --> 10:05.230
it's gonna be more than just words
we're exchanging.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.732
Know what I'm saying?

10:09.734 --> 10:10.819
VERONICA: Excuse me.

10:10.902 --> 10:13.613
Are you the Tim Giles
that represented Lincoln Burrows?

10:13.696 --> 10:14.781
Look, if you're a reporter, I...

10:14.864 --> 10:17.742
I'm not a reporter.
I know the defendant personally.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.621
- You family?
- Not exactly.

10:21.871 --> 10:24.207
We were in a relationship
a few years back.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.042
Well, look, ma'am, I...

10:26.126 --> 10:28.294
I don't know what to tell you.
I mean, the man was guilty.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.880
The prosecution's case was a slam dunk.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.049
Because the victim was
the Vice President's brother?

10:33.133 --> 10:36.261
If you're suggesting that the federal
government rammed this thing through,

10:36.344 --> 10:38.388
I take offense to that,
'cause I fought for that guy.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.181
That's not what I meant.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.725
The evidence was there.

10:42.934 --> 10:44.561
Lincoln worked for Steadman's company.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.897
He gets into a public altercation
with the guy, so he gets fired.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.732
Two weeks later, Steadman's shot dead.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.568
The murder weapon's found
in Lincoln's house,

10:51.651 --> 10:53.403
and the victim's blood found
on his clothes.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.947
Trust me,
there are cases you lose sleep over,

10:56.030 --> 10:57.824
but this isn't one of them.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.326
What about Crab Simmons?

11:00.410 --> 11:03.788
Lincoln said he could exonerate him.
Why didn't you put him on the stand?

11:03.872 --> 11:08.042
The man's a five-time felon, all right? He...
He had no credibility.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.128
So you wouldn't mind if I paid him a visit?

11:10.211 --> 11:13.214
Be my guest.
But I don't think it'll do you any good.

11:33.276 --> 11:36.279
Strange feeling.
Don't know how to explain it.

11:39.616 --> 11:40.950
You know,

11:41.993 --> 11:46.206
usually my whole life,
it's always been crazy, noisy.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.752
Maddening, you know, in my head.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.379
But right now it's quiet.

11:54.422 --> 11:57.967
It's perfect. I'm glad you came back.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.972
I thought about you the whole time.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.227
You know,
I made a lot of mistakes in my life.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.561
I know that.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.481
I'm gonna make it right.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.107
I know you will.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.661
- What are you doing?
- I want to remember this.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.828
- No.
- Oh, come on.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.414
- Come on, V, please. Just one.
- Okay.

12:28.498 --> 12:29.707
Come on.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.093
Be easy, man.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.804
- How we doing on the PUGNAc?
- Hey, I'm working on it.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.640
Well, work faster. I need that stuff tonight.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.852
What's up there in that infirmary
that you need so bad?

12:50.186 --> 12:53.189
You get me that PUGNAc,
and maybe I'll tell you.

13:10.790 --> 13:14.460
Thought we had an understanding.
This here's for the family.

13:14.877 --> 13:18.965
You made it pretty clear you ain't blood.
How about you hand that over?

13:31.519 --> 13:33.229
Nice-looking piece of steel.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.732
A bit of work, you could do
some serious damage with it.

13:37.567 --> 13:40.737
The question is, who is it
you was planning on damaging?

13:41.237 --> 13:43.323
I seen you with the negroes, you know.

13:43.406 --> 13:47.201
What, maybe you're one of
them milk chickens, all confused-like?

13:47.285 --> 13:50.246
White on the outside,
black as tar on the inside.

13:50.455 --> 13:53.833
Maybe we ought to take a look
at them insides and find out, huh?

13:53.916 --> 13:57.420
Girl Scouts, is there a problem over there?

14:00.131 --> 14:03.384
Think we'll just hang on to this,
if that's okay with you.

14:04.344 --> 14:08.097
Hey, I'm not gonna ask you again.
Let's break up the party, ladies.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.517
You heard the man, little doggie.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.520
Get along.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.453
What's it take
to shake down another inmate?

15:53.536 --> 15:55.413
Get something he's taken from you?

15:55.496 --> 15:57.415
It would take Fibonacci.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.250
Well, I'll give you Fibonacci.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.879
I promise you that. When the time is right.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.422
The time is right now.

16:04.505 --> 16:07.884
No, the time is right when you and I are
both standing outside those walls.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.844
You're sitting on life without parole.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.888
You're never gonna
stand outside those walls again,

16:11.971 --> 16:13.806
not unless you knew someone.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.808
Someone who knew a way out.

16:16.350 --> 16:20.396
- What do you say, John?
- I say I've heard nothing but blabber.

16:41.459 --> 16:45.254
Philly Falzone. It's an honor.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.632
What are you doing here?

16:47.924 --> 16:51.719
Well I just thought we'd,
you know, fraternize.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.971
He looks like it, doesn't he?

16:54.055 --> 16:55.223
Looks what?

16:55.306 --> 16:59.602
Like everybody's been saying.
You got no sack. You've been neutered.

17:01.103 --> 17:04.857
You shouldn't talk to me like that.
You used to pick up my laundry.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.275
Not anymore, John.

17:06.358 --> 17:10.404
John, word is there's someone in here
that knows where Fibonacci is,

17:10.488 --> 17:12.698
-and you're not doing anything about it.
- I'm working on it.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.034
Well, you're not working on it fast enough.

17:15.117 --> 17:18.162
Apparently Fibonacci's coming up
for air again.

17:18.246 --> 17:20.790
Next month, a congressional hearing.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.960
Now, if he testifies at that hearing,

17:24.042 --> 17:27.505
a lot of people are going down,
including me.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.633
Now, I've known you a long time.

17:30.716 --> 17:34.679
Our wives are friends,
our kids go to the same Catholic school.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.557
Now, it would be a shame

17:37.640 --> 17:40.142
if anything were to happen to your kids.

17:40.226 --> 17:43.312
- I know my kids would miss them.
- You don't need to do this.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.480
I do.

17:45.106 --> 17:48.109
I'll get this guy. We'll get Fibonacci.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.862
Well, for everyone's sake,
I hope you're right.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.114
I am.

17:53.322 --> 17:54.699
Be well, John.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.077
Thank you.

18:07.670 --> 18:10.673
Yo, badge, I gotta use the phone!

18:12.675 --> 18:15.219
Sure, no problem.
You want a pizza and a pedicure, too?

18:15.303 --> 18:18.472
No, it's Monday, man. I gotta call my girl!
She's expecting my call.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.141
Put a sock in it. You got nothing coming.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.893
No, no, no, man! No, man! Hey!

18:29.525 --> 18:32.236
Hey, pull up the manifest.

18:34.989 --> 18:37.491
Is there an Allen Schweitzer in Gen Pop?

18:39.702 --> 18:41.829
- Nope.
- How about the SHU?

18:42.538 --> 18:44.832
No. Why are you asking?

18:44.915 --> 18:46.667
Curious, that's all.

19:25.748 --> 19:27.583
You hear the trumpets, Fish?

19:27.792 --> 19:29.418
I know you can.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.587
That's Judgment Day.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.256
It's coming. Real soon.

19:41.222 --> 19:44.266
T-BAG: Yo, curly! Come on, Maytag.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.245
What you doing in my cell?

20:08.916 --> 20:10.251
I want in.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.763
I'm not quite sure I heard that, Fish.
Did you just say you're in?

20:22.847 --> 20:23.973
That's right.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.309
You know the old saying, don't you?
"In for an inch, in for a mile."

20:27.393 --> 20:29.478
Whatever it takes.
You want me to fight, I'll fight.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.814
The bolt from the bleachers,
that's what it was for.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.107
Well,

20:33.190 --> 20:36.485
you wanna fight,
you ought to get your chance.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.362
- Next count.
- Tonight?

20:38.446 --> 20:41.490
Problem with that?
'Cause we're going straight at them.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.743
You better catch it square, Fish.

20:43.826 --> 20:45.828
We're undermanned in a big way.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.164
- All I need's a weapon.
- You want a weapon, bitch?

20:56.422 --> 20:59.341
before we trust you with the

21:10.144 --> 21:12.980
I wanted to apologize
for being so short with you before.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.691
- No problem.
- The closer he gets to an execution,

21:15.775 --> 21:19.320
the harder it becomes, so...
That's why I want to give you this.

21:19.862 --> 21:22.990
It's the surveillance tape
of the garage that night.

21:23.073 --> 21:25.910
It was a closed trial,
so no one outside of the courtroom saw it.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.745
But I thought it could help you out.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.872
- With what?
- Closure.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.631
Allen Schweitzer.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.217
That name mean anything to you?

22:24.969 --> 22:27.763
- Should it?
- I don't know. You tell me.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.934
Never heard of the guy.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.937
- Are you sure?
- Posmve.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.463
What's up, snowflake?

23:08.596 --> 23:10.389
Do you think I'm a fool?

23:11.765 --> 23:13.309
What are you talking about?

23:13.392 --> 23:15.895
I see you up there with the Hitler Youth.

23:18.022 --> 23:20.733
You know, I got a good mind
to slash you open right now.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.484
It's not what you think.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.778
They've got something I need.

23:25.446 --> 23:29.074
Now, see, that's funny.
Because I got something you need, too.

23:31.493 --> 23:34.288
Hey, you want your PUGNAc, Fish, huh?

23:37.333 --> 23:40.169
Right here, baby. It's all you.

23:43.464 --> 23:46.300
Listen, white boy, your luck just ran out.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.303
You chose the wrong side.

24:33.013 --> 24:35.140
It's great to see your face.

24:39.853 --> 24:42.606
I think it's time you quit the charade,
don%you?

24:42.690 --> 24:45.609
- What?
- It's starting to ruin people's lives.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.322
Michael's in here
because he thinks you're innocent.

24:50.406 --> 24:51.740
What's he told you?

24:51.824 --> 24:54.535
He hasn't told me anything,
but I know, Lincoln.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.286
I know what he's planning.

24:56.996 --> 25:00.582
Call him off. If you love him, call him off.

25:02.918 --> 25:04.420
I saw the tape.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.171
What's on the tape's
not how it went down.

25:06.255 --> 25:07.756
I know what I saw.

25:07.965 --> 25:10.759
I know what I saw.
I was there, remember?

25:15.389 --> 25:18.100
<i>LINCOLN: I got high that night. I had f0.</i>

25:18.183 --> 25:20.936

<i>I never pulled the trigger.
The guy was already dead.</i>

25:39.371 --> 25:42.458
- Yeah, I know. You told me...
- Then listen! Shut up!

25:42.541 --> 25:44.376
I went there that night to clear a debt.

25:44.460 --> 25:47.129
Crab Simmons was on my ass
for the $90,000 I owed him.

25:47.212 --> 25:50.841
Told me the mark was some scumbag
drug dealer, and if I took it, I'd be clean.

25:50.924 --> 25:52.801
I never pulled the trigger.
All I know is that

25:52.885 --> 25:55.763
somebody wanted me in the same garage
as Terrence Steadman that night.

25:55.846 --> 25:58.140
Why would somebody wanna set you up?

26:00.809 --> 26:03.103
It wasn't about me, it was about him.

26:03.187 --> 26:04.813
- Stead man?
- Yes.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.524
The guy was like a saint.
All the charity work,

26:07.608 --> 26:09.818
the environmental progress
his company was making.

26:09.902 --> 26:13.197
About the only person in this entire
country who had motive to kill him

26:13.280 --> 26:14.448
was you.

26:14.656 --> 26:17.868
You came all the way down here
to tell me how guilty I am?

26:19.745 --> 26:21.663
I don't know why I came here.

26:27.002 --> 26:30.005
You have your life now. I know that.

26:30.089 --> 26:34.760
But if what we had before meant anything
to you, you'd find out the truth.

26:38.055 --> 26:40.307
Maybe all this is the truth.

26:41.350 --> 26:43.268
Maybe they got it right.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.619
Come on, dog. What you all doing?

27:00.869 --> 27:03.539

- It's my girl's birthday.
- Happy birthday to her.

Well, you gotta let me call her, please.
I'll give you $1 million

- I've seen your kick, Sucre.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.276
You got something like 40 cents
to your name.

27:32.359 --> 27:35.070
Please! No, God, no!

27:57.593 --> 28:01.680
All right, Maricruz.
What are you doing? Come on.

28:01.763 --> 28:05.267
- It's okay, Hector. You go ahead.
- What are you talking about?

28:05.350 --> 28:07.227
I think I'm just gonna take a cab.

28:07.311 --> 28:10.772
What do you mean? Like go home?
I mean, you just got here.

28:14.484 --> 28:16.403
He didn't call you, did he?

28:18.906 --> 28:20.115
Look,

28:20.574 --> 28:24.119
I love Fernando to death,
but the guy's a deadbeat.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.622
You gotta move on with your life.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.007
Mr. Giles, we'd like to have
a word with you, if we could.

28:37.090 --> 28:40.302
- Oh, I really...
- I'm afraid we're going to have to insist.

28:41.970 --> 28:45.140
It's come to our attention that you made
a FOIL request a couple of days ago

28:45.224 --> 28:46.725
on the Burrows case.

28:48.644 --> 28:49.645
Yeah. So?

28:49.728 --> 28:52.147
Records show that you made
a dupe of the surveillance tape.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.482
That's right.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.651
Mind us asking why?

28:56.902 --> 28:59.112
It was for one
of Burrows' old girlfriends, man.

28:59.196 --> 29:01.823
She was under the impression
that the guy was innocent.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.659
I figured it'd, you know,
help her with closure.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.535
She's in possession of the tape now, then?

29:05.619 --> 29:09.164
Don't pull that card on me.
It's the Freedom of Information Act.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.375
She's entitled to that tape
as much as you or I.

29:11.458 --> 29:14.002
Oh, no, no. By all means, by all means.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.505
- May I go now?
- Just one more thing.

29:16.588 --> 29:20.175
This old girlfriend of his. What's her name?

29:33.021 --> 29:35.691
Excuse me.
Is this the Simmons residence?

29:35.774 --> 29:37.359
I'm Ms. Simmons.

29:37.442 --> 29:41.113
I'm sorry. I'm Veronica Donovan.

29:41.196 --> 29:43.782
I'm looking for Crab Simmons.
Are you related?

29:44.324 --> 29:46.535
- He's my son.
- Is he around?

29:46.994 --> 29:49.579
- No.
- Could you tell me where I could find him?

29:49.663 --> 29:52.541
Lady, go away. I can't help you.
Can't you understand that?

29:52.624 --> 29:54.501
Look, I'm sorry. lt'sjust...

29:55.627 --> 29:59.381
A man's life is at stake,
and maybe your son could help him.

29:59.715 --> 30:02.884
Crab can't help nobody, lady. He's dead.

30:06.013 --> 30:07.347
I'm sorry.

32:46.715 --> 32:49.217
You're a dead man!

33:35.597 --> 33:38.433
I really don't know
what to say to you, gentlemen.

33:38.767 --> 33:43.396
I try to give you the benefit of the doubt.
I try to treat you with respect.

33:45.315 --> 33:47.526
You can't even respect yourselves.

33:47.609 --> 33:50.445
So there's going to be a 48-hour lockdown.

33:50.529 --> 33:53.657
No mess, no showers, no visitation.

33:54.783 --> 33:58.787
And I strongly suggest
that you all learn to get along.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.414
Otherwise,
the next time it's gonna be a week,

34:01.498 --> 34:03.959
and the time after that,
it's gonna be a month.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.544
Think about it.

34:38.618 --> 34:42.330
- Got a Leticia Barrie on the line.
- I don't know who that is. Take a message.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.748
She says she used to date Crab Simmons.

34:48.545 --> 34:50.338
Leticia, thank you for calling.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.924
<i>You want to hear what I have to say,
we meet in a public place</i>

34:53.007 --> 34:54.175
<i>where they can't get to us.</i>

Whoa, whoa. Where who can't get to us?

34:56.594 --> 34:58.513
<i>You want to hear
what I have to say or not?</i>

34:58.597 --> 35:00.557
<i>'Cause if you don't,
I'm gonna hang up right now.</i>

35:00.640 --> 35:03.435
No,no,no.
You just name the time and the place.

35:07.981 --> 35:09.107
Over here.

35:09.190 --> 35:11.359
- Hey, Leticia, thanks for coming.
- Go easy, lady.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.486
We don't know each other, you got that?

35:13.570 --> 35:16.114
We'll stay out here in the open
where they can't get to us.

35:16.197 --> 35:18.283
Where they can't do what they do.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.702
Only reason why I'm talking to you,

35:20.785 --> 35:22.871
'cause they're gonna kill your boy
like they killed mine.

35:22.954 --> 35:26.249
Coroner's report says smack killed your
boyfriend, Leticia. It was an overdose.

35:26.333 --> 35:27.417
No overdose.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.210
- What do you mean?
- Crab didn't use.

35:29.294 --> 35:32.255
He had a bad heart.
If he touched the stuff, it'd kill him.

35:32.339 --> 35:34.966
I mean, don't you think
it's the slightest bit of a coincidence

35:35.050 --> 35:37.552
he OD-ed
a week after your boyfriend's crime?

35:37.636 --> 35:40.221
They killed him 'cause he knew things.

35:40.305 --> 35:42.265
- Things they didn't want to get out.
- Like what?

35:42.349 --> 35:44.434
Like who was
really behind that hit that night.

35:44.517 --> 35:47.562
It wasn't Crab, that's for damn sure.
And it sure as hell wasn't Lincoln.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.689
Neither of them boys knew
what they were getting into.

35:49.773 --> 35:51.733
They were just pawns in a big game.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.234
- What?
- They're here.

35:53.318 --> 35:54.319
Who's here, Leticia?

35:54.402 --> 35:56.905
Don't try to follow me. Don't find me.
I won't testify.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.573
Just slow down and talk to me.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.867
I'd get as far away from here
as you can, girl,

36:00.950 --> 36:03.578
'cause there ain't nobody they can't get to.

Hello.

36:42.867 --> 36:46.955
We have a small complication.
There's a lawyer poking around.

36:47.122 --> 36:48.790

36:49.874 --> 36:51.167
Yes.

You can handle a girl

who graduated in the middle
of her Baylor Law School class.

36:57.132 --> 37:01.970
At least I'd like to think so, given the
stakes of what we're dealing with here.

37:08.309 --> 37:12.313
Anyone that's a threat
to what we're doing is expendable.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.816
- Anyone.
- Understood.

37:14.899 --> 37:17.318
<i>Then do what you need to do
to make this go</i> away.

37:17.402 --> 37:18.653
(PHONE CLICKS)

37:31.416 --> 37:33.460
Are you there, pretty?

37:38.006 --> 37:39.966
I know you're there.

37:40.467 --> 37:43.678
Just want you to know I'm coming for you.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.765
You got nowhere to run.

37:47.348 --> 37:50.560
You're trapped in that little hole of yours.

37:51.102 --> 37:54.063
Trapped like a pig
that I'm gonna slaughter.

39:25.321 --> 39:27.907
- Who's my 1:00?
- Michael Scofield.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.955
I was wrong about you, Scofield.
Here's your PUGNAc.

39:34.289 --> 39:37.125
- Little bit late.
- Better late than never, right?

39:37.208 --> 39:39.252
Scofield! Infirmary.

39:39.335 --> 39:40.920
We'll see about that.

39:44.048 --> 39:47.969
I'm gonna find out, you know,
what it is you're doing up there.

39:58.938 --> 40:01.399
- How long does this take?
- It used to take hours.

40:01.482 --> 40:03.484
They've come a long way
with the new glucose kits.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.486
This'll take us about 10 seconds.

40:05.570 --> 40:08.573
Slide the strip into the meter,
we're ready to go.

40:11.159 --> 40:12.619
I'm sure you know this, but

40:12.702 --> 40:16.456
average glucose for a non-diabetic
is about 100 milligrams per deciliter.

40:16.539 --> 40:20.460
So we see a number like that here,
and we know you've been misdiagnosed.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.510
You seem nervous.

40:30.595 --> 40:33.014
- I do?
- You're sweating.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.933
Must be the needles.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.936
Never really got used to them.

40:38.019 --> 40:41.689
Somehow, with diabetes
and that tattoo, I find that hard to believe.

40:45.860 --> 40:47.403
Bad news, I'm afraid.

40:50.573 --> 40:54.118
180 milligrams per deciliter.
You're definitely diabetic.

41:00.917 --> 41:04.837
- Do you need anything else from me?
- Arm to stick a needle in.

41:05.254 --> 41:08.049
- Okay.
- I'll see you Wednesday.

41:09.842 --> 41:11.970
- Cute.
- Pflsonen

41:14.138 --> 41:16.557
I don't know,
there's something strange about him.

41:16.641 --> 41:17.725
What do you mean?

41:17.809 --> 41:21.062
I gave him the results of his blood test,
and there was this look on his face.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.397
It was

41:23.606 --> 41:24.774
relief.

41:28.945 --> 41:32.323
It's all right, I got it.
I'm headed over to A Wing anyhow.

41:32.532 --> 41:33.783
(WHISTLING)

41:35.284 --> 41:37.412
You're positively beaming, boss.

41:37.495 --> 41:40.832
Got up on the right side of the bed
this morning, I guess.

41:40.915 --> 41:45.169
Hold up. Sugar.
Now, don't you move, Fishy.

41:47.088 --> 41:49.924
- What are you doing?
- You're coming with us, Fish.

41:53.594 --> 41:55.221
(ABRUZZI HUMMING)

42:04.230 --> 42:08.276
This little polka
you and I have been doing for a while,

42:08.484 --> 42:10.653
as of this moment,

42:12.280 --> 42:13.573
it's over.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.039
Fibonacci.

42:21.539 --> 42:26.085
I wanna know how you got to him
and where he is right now.

42:26.335 --> 42:28.254
Not gonna happen, John.

42:45.897 --> 42:48.149
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

42:49.317 --> 42:50.401
One.

42:50.485 --> 42:53.571
I give you that information,
I'm a dead man.

42:53.821 --> 42:56.365
You know it, and I know it.

42:56.449 --> 42:57.825
Two.

42:58.993 --> 43:02.038
I'll tell you the moment we're outside
those walls, and not a second before.

43:02.121 --> 43:03.664
You tell me now.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.543
Not gonna happen, John.

43:07.710 --> 43:11.380
Hey, I'm gonna give you one last chance.

43:21.766 --> 43:23.017
Three.
