00:01.104 --> 00:02.576
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:02.606 --> 00:03.979
So I got to ask, when's this wedding?

00:04.009 --> 00:06.630
10 days. After that, 
Hayley's power is your power.

00:06.660 --> 00:08.265
The full moon won't control you anymore.

00:08.295 --> 00:11.605
(Klaus): You truly believe that
he is worthy of your trust?

00:11.635 --> 00:15.826
Yes... I want to tell you a story
about a beautiful baby girl.

00:15.856 --> 00:17.584
Elijah will remain here with you.

00:17.614 --> 00:20.037
He's been experiencing some side effects

00:20.039 --> 00:22.139
since his ordeal as our mother's captive.

00:22.141 --> 00:24.510
I curse you to this body,

00:24.844 --> 00:27.804
a meaningless, lonely death.

00:27.834 --> 00:29.885
- You know who I am.
- Freya.

00:29.915 --> 00:32.149
Tell our brothers I'll be coming 
to see them soon.

00:32.151 --> 00:34.351
(Finn): How does it feel, hunger so intense,

00:34.353 --> 00:37.580
like shards of glass creeping
through your veins?

00:37.610 --> 00:39.602
How, exactly, did baby die?

00:39.632 --> 00:42.382
She's still alive.

00:42.412 --> 00:43.994
You and your vampires

00:43.996 --> 00:46.897
are gonna help me find her.

00:46.899 --> 00:50.149
(Trumpet playing)

00:55.014 --> 00:58.826
(Finn chanting)

01:04.114 --> 01:08.128

01:43.757 --> 01:45.640
Who are you?

01:45.670 --> 01:49.217
I was wondering if you'd recognize me.

01:51.139 --> 01:54.569
Then again, you look
a bit different yourself.

01:54.599 --> 01:56.137
I'm gonna ask you again

01:56.167 --> 01:59.556
before I ask much less nicely.

01:59.586 --> 02:01.693
Who are you?

02:04.521 --> 02:07.293
Fitting I find you up here.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.584
We used to climb into the trees

02:08.614 --> 02:11.646
when we were planning a bit of mischief.

02:12.183 --> 02:13.532
Never wanted mother to hear what

02:13.562 --> 02:17.199
her little Hunin and Munin
were whispering about.

02:19.089 --> 02:21.437
Now, Finn, don't break my heart

02:21.467 --> 02:24.207
and tell me you've forgotten me.

02:27.447 --> 02:29.174
It can't be.

02:32.451 --> 02:33.972
Freya.

"The Devil is Damned"

02:52.387 --> 02:54.313
(Wind whistling)

02:54.343 --> 02:55.834
That is just not my chin, Nik.

02:55.864 --> 02:57.168
It was much more delicate.

02:57.198 --> 02:58.386
The only delicate thing

02:58.416 --> 03:00.716
about you, sister, is your ego.

03:00.718 --> 03:03.841
When placed beside the 
behemoth size of yours, certainly.

03:03.871 --> 03:05.370
(Elijah, on speakerphone):
Could we dispense with this

03:05.372 --> 03:07.372
fascinating dispute for just
a moment and return

03:07.374 --> 03:09.261
to the subject of our
supposed long-lost sister?

03:09.291 --> 03:11.365
There's not much to discuss, Elijah.

03:11.395 --> 03:13.887
Said she was Freya and then
darted off into the night.

03:13.917 --> 03:14.880
And you believed her.

03:14.910 --> 03:16.637
(Rebekah): Well, I met the girl
in a mystical loony bin.

03:16.667 --> 03:18.798
She could be anyone telling any lie,

03:18.828 --> 03:22.304
but she did seem familiar somehow.

03:22.306 --> 03:24.506
Then how is she still alive,

03:25.101 --> 03:27.530
a question as ridiculous
as its possible solutions,

03:27.560 --> 03:30.830
given this family's annoying 
predilection for cheating death?

03:30.860 --> 03:32.971
I don't know, Nik. I'm just
telling you what she said.

03:33.001 --> 03:34.232
Well, did you happen to ask

03:34.234 --> 03:35.634
if, by some similar miracle,

03:35.636 --> 03:37.225
our Aunt Dahlia lives, as well?

03:37.255 --> 03:38.238
I barely had a chance to process...

03:38.279 --> 03:39.960
Because on the list of obvious questions,

03:39.990 --> 03:41.723
it would be nice to know
if the woman who placed

03:41.725 --> 03:43.913
a curse on the firstborns of this family

03:43.943 --> 03:45.060
is still breathing air.

03:45.090 --> 03:47.501
Then let me turn back time
and do it again to your liking, then.

03:47.531 --> 03:49.764
(Elijah, on speakerphone):
Enough, both of you.

03:49.766 --> 03:51.805
(Elijah): If she is who she says,
we'll find out soon enough.

03:51.835 --> 03:54.396
For now, it remains imperative
that no one learns of Hope's existence.

03:54.426 --> 03:56.893
This has been our salvation thus far.

03:56.923 --> 03:58.495
(Klaus): Unless Hayley's husband-to-be

03:58.525 --> 04:00.097
(Klaus): starts flapping his gums.

04:00.127 --> 04:01.693
Perhaps I should take
preventative measures

04:01.695 --> 04:03.361
and separate him from his head.

04:03.363 --> 04:07.327
Jackson will do nothing
to jeopardize that wedding.

04:08.690 --> 04:11.603
Hayley's getting married.

04:12.067 --> 04:15.332
Well, what in hell else did I miss?

04:17.875 --> 04:19.444
Uh, why do people keep leaving

04:19.446 --> 04:21.673
broomsticks on the porch,

04:21.702 --> 04:25.138
seeing as I'm not exactly a "sweep while
the soup is cooking" kind of gal?

04:25.168 --> 04:28.614
Well, back in the day,

04:28.887 --> 04:31.041
it wasn't easy getting
a preacher out here.

04:31.071 --> 04:34.653
So if you were engaged
and you couldn't wait,

04:34.683 --> 04:37.568
then the community would
let your jump the broom.

04:37.598 --> 04:39.046
Couldn't wait for what?

04:39.048 --> 04:41.959
(Music playing)

04:44.665 --> 04:46.159
Oh. Ahem.

04:46.189 --> 04:47.688
Yep. Um...

04:47.690 --> 04:49.436
I would have been happier with

04:49.466 --> 04:51.108
a panini press.

04:51.138 --> 04:54.211
Ha ha ha! Just a tradition.

04:54.213 --> 04:57.647
Yeah. I got it.

05:02.407 --> 05:05.754
So what are you working on?

05:05.872 --> 05:09.298
Oh, I started this for your little girl

05:09.328 --> 05:11.550
when you lived here before.

05:11.580 --> 05:14.336
Now that she's alive...

05:16.653 --> 05:19.509
Figured it was time to finish it.

05:24.420 --> 05:25.976
Um, something else.

05:26.006 --> 05:28.462
I'm getting word from a few packs

05:28.464 --> 05:30.086
outside of Louisiana.

05:30.116 --> 05:31.982
They want to be here for the wedding.

05:31.984 --> 05:33.784
They want in on the unification ritual.

05:33.786 --> 05:35.152
I thought the ritual only affected

05:35.154 --> 05:36.928
the powers of the wolves in our pack.

05:36.958 --> 05:39.778
Unless they recognize me as their Alpha.

05:39.808 --> 05:41.447
Then your power becomes their power.

05:41.477 --> 05:42.843
You think other alphas

05:42.845 --> 05:44.965
will step down and bow to you?

05:45.444 --> 05:47.814
They're coming here today to do just that.

05:48.724 --> 05:50.384
They want what you have, Hayley.

05:50.386 --> 05:51.457
I mean, we all do.

05:51.487 --> 05:54.288
In a couple weeks after the wedding,

05:54.990 --> 05:57.378
you are gonna have one hell of an army

05:57.408 --> 05:59.993
to protect your little girl.

06:02.813 --> 06:05.856
(Rebekah): Nik? Nik.

06:06.876 --> 06:08.987
- (Beep)
- That was Aiden.

06:09.017 --> 06:13.052
- Finn has Marcel.
- What? Why?

06:13.082 --> 06:15.661
I don't know, nor do I know
where they are, what they're doing,

06:15.691 --> 06:18.539
or what specifically to do about it.

06:20.248 --> 06:23.083
This family make me
want to murder people.

06:23.113 --> 06:26.675
(Kol): I see my timing is
as impeccable as usual.

06:26.705 --> 06:30.211
Oh, the traitor thinks he can just
waltz in here like he's welcome.

06:30.241 --> 06:32.253
As gracious as your apology better be,

06:32.283 --> 06:33.394
you're still getting one hell of a slap.

06:33.424 --> 06:35.328
Wait, wait.

06:35.330 --> 06:38.698
I understand the irony of what
I'm about to say, but I came here

06:38.728 --> 06:40.858
because I need your help.

06:40.888 --> 06:42.991
Think about how to undo your
wicked, little body swap,

06:43.021 --> 06:44.376
and then we can talk about help.

06:44.406 --> 06:46.106
Look. You don't understand, Nik.

06:46.108 --> 06:47.741
Finn has locked me in this body,

06:47.743 --> 06:49.915
no more jumping.

06:49.945 --> 06:53.079
He's put a curse on me, Nik. I am dying.

06:53.555 --> 06:55.863
Hmm.

06:56.484 --> 06:59.024
Heh. You don't believe me.

06:59.054 --> 07:01.254
Well, you're hardly the
champion of truth telling.

07:01.256 --> 07:02.189
Of course.

07:02.219 --> 07:04.730
Why would a brother expect 
his siblings to leap to his aid?

07:04.760 --> 07:06.948
Oh, spare me the pity party, Kol.

07:06.978 --> 07:09.894
Your recent actions merit
a certain allowance for disbelief.

07:09.924 --> 07:12.320
Look. I know what I've done,

07:12.697 --> 07:15.615
but I won't apologize for trying
to pull one over on your Bex.

07:15.645 --> 07:19.405
You deserved it, but
I don't deserve to die,

07:19.435 --> 07:22.375
certainly not at the hands
of my own family.

07:22.704 --> 07:26.479
What kind of con are you playing?

07:27.130 --> 07:29.531
The con I hate the most...

07:29.561 --> 07:31.410
The truth.

07:35.337 --> 07:37.206
He's not lying.

07:37.236 --> 07:38.741
Even as a boy, Kol never lied

07:38.743 --> 07:40.570
once called out on the act.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.291
He may play dirty pool,

07:42.321 --> 07:46.104
but he's not lying.

07:50.668 --> 07:52.394
(Sniffs)

07:52.719 --> 07:55.746
Nik, I was helping Marcel for Davina.

07:55.776 --> 07:56.776
Finn has got him.

07:56.806 --> 07:58.349
He's trying to get a secret out of him,

07:58.379 --> 08:01.836
something he thinks
Marcel knows about you.

08:09.475 --> 08:11.891
Huh. He's right, isn't he?

08:11.921 --> 08:13.942
Marcel doesn't know
anything about anything.

08:13.972 --> 08:15.461
Well, you better hope that that's true

08:15.463 --> 08:17.296
because, believe me,

08:17.860 --> 08:20.132
Finn has the means to get it out of him.

08:20.678 --> 08:23.174
I'm here because of a spell 
that Dahlia cast

08:23.204 --> 08:25.931
placing me in a deep sleep for a century,

08:25.961 --> 08:28.540
only to then wake for
a single year of life.

08:28.542 --> 08:31.310
I've repeated this cycle
for hundreds of years.

08:31.312 --> 08:33.779
It started as a way for us to stay young

08:33.780 --> 08:35.080
and beautiful.

08:35.110 --> 08:36.424
She said, "if a witch can't be immortal,

08:36.455 --> 08:38.972
this was the next best thing,"

08:39.001 --> 08:40.658
but in time, I realized

08:40.688 --> 08:43.823
that all her stories
were paired with lies.

08:43.852 --> 08:46.205
The way you're speaking of her,

08:46.884 --> 08:50.029
you're saying that Dahlia is still alive.

08:50.498 --> 08:53.565
She doesn't just live. She hunts.

08:54.924 --> 08:56.156
I fled from her long ago

08:56.186 --> 08:58.338
and have been running ever since.

08:58.368 --> 09:01.906
To Dahlia, any act of betrayal

09:01.936 --> 09:04.261
is punishable by death.

09:07.387 --> 09:09.978
Dahlia is my cross to bear.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.356
She has no grudge against anyone but me.

09:12.386 --> 09:13.857
Did she ever speak to you about the curse

09:13.887 --> 09:16.038
she placed on this family,
the one that said she can take

09:16.068 --> 09:18.359
the firstborn of every generation?

09:18.389 --> 09:21.932
Yes, but why should that concern you?

09:21.962 --> 09:23.928
Our siblings are vampires.

09:23.930 --> 09:27.632
There are no firstborns for her to take.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.250
Niklaus...

09:30.831 --> 09:32.362
The hybrid...

09:33.342 --> 09:36.041
He had a daughter.

09:39.190 --> 09:40.908
Where is she?

09:40.938 --> 09:42.327
He has her hidden.

09:42.357 --> 09:43.704
Our mother filled my head

09:43.734 --> 09:45.250
with the terror of what would happen

09:45.280 --> 09:47.085
to all of us if that child had lived,

09:47.087 --> 09:48.486
and I've been searching for her,

09:48.488 --> 09:49.850
but she's been impossible to find.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.419
Nothing is impossible to find, Finn.

09:52.449 --> 09:53.380
Yep.

09:53.410 --> 09:56.711
As powerful as you are, I found you.

10:01.232 --> 10:03.205
I'll need wormwood and ripple weed

10:03.235 --> 10:05.700
and a few other items.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.082
I've come to understand a hard lesson

10:14.112 --> 10:16.644
in our time apart.

10:18.096 --> 10:21.197
You have to let some things die

10:21.227 --> 10:25.476
so that others might live.

11:00.584 --> 11:02.418
I know you're in there.

11:02.420 --> 11:04.286
Whatever Finn has in store,

11:04.562 --> 11:06.622
we're gonna get through this together.

11:06.866 --> 11:08.457
(Footsteps)

11:08.459 --> 11:10.259
(Finn): It's that can-do spirit

11:10.261 --> 11:12.867
that makes you the perfect choice.

11:13.494 --> 11:15.114
Got a job for you.

11:15.144 --> 11:16.599
I don't think so.

11:30.811 --> 11:32.193
Really?

11:32.723 --> 11:34.685
You care to reconsider?

11:37.253 --> 11:38.420
(Splat)

11:44.071 --> 11:46.295
Look. What do you want me to do?

11:47.224 --> 11:49.298
It's simple, really.

11:49.300 --> 11:53.268
I need you to bring me Hayley's blood.

11:56.178 --> 11:58.407
(Cooing)

12:11.676 --> 12:14.189
- (Crash)
- (Hope screams)

12:14.191 --> 12:15.198
Oh...

12:15.228 --> 12:17.381
(Crying)

12:17.411 --> 12:20.879
She yanked the tablecloth, and
that knickknack fell on her.

12:20.881 --> 12:22.514
(Crying continues)

12:22.516 --> 12:24.582
It's just a scratch. Oh...

12:24.584 --> 12:26.584
(Screaming)

12:35.089 --> 12:37.012
(Cami): Elijah?

12:37.014 --> 12:38.513
Elijah!

12:38.515 --> 12:40.548
Yes. Forgive me.

12:40.550 --> 12:42.951
- Um...
- (Crying)

12:52.258 --> 12:53.728
So what is the secret, anyway?

12:53.730 --> 12:55.945
The term "secret" implies something

12:55.975 --> 12:57.758
only known by those who have earned

12:57.788 --> 13:00.468
the right to be aware of it.

13:00.832 --> 13:01.936
Start the spell.

13:01.938 --> 13:03.605
Well, it's easier said than done.

13:03.607 --> 13:06.642
Finn is channeling the
power from our parents.

13:06.672 --> 13:07.775
He's a lot stronger than something

13:07.777 --> 13:09.310
some week-old witch and I can do.

13:09.312 --> 13:11.530
Now hang on. I might not
be trained, but I...

13:12.048 --> 13:13.147
(Gasps)

13:13.149 --> 13:14.382
Oh...

13:17.061 --> 13:19.587
Oh... Blast.

13:20.470 --> 13:22.552
We need a stronger witch. Call Davina.

13:22.582 --> 13:24.275
No, no, no, no, no.

13:24.305 --> 13:25.865
I don't want her to know that I'm sick.

13:25.895 --> 13:29.994
- Then do a better bloody job.
- I just need time.

13:30.024 --> 13:32.163
This spell that Finn cast to lock you

13:32.193 --> 13:34.035
in your body, do you remember it?

13:34.037 --> 13:37.204
Well, I was a little distracted 
by the murdery part.

13:37.206 --> 13:39.454
If we can use his own spell against him,

13:39.484 --> 13:40.708
once he's locked in his body,

13:40.710 --> 13:44.793
I can end our collective woes
with a brief snap of the neck.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.747
All I need to do is pull it 
from your memory.

13:46.749 --> 13:47.865
No. No, no.

13:47.895 --> 13:50.705
I am not allowing anybody into 
my mind. Do you understand?

13:50.735 --> 13:54.805
You came into my home asking for my help.

13:55.666 --> 13:57.166
This is it.

13:58.495 --> 14:00.861
It's not a request.

14:00.891 --> 14:02.419
I've wanted one thing for years...

14:02.449 --> 14:04.609
To drive a dagger into his heart.

14:05.584 --> 14:07.685
Uh! Uh!

14:11.920 --> 14:13.324
See?

14:13.837 --> 14:16.288
I'm guessing just by the look on your face

14:16.368 --> 14:18.880
that it worked, but just listen.

14:18.910 --> 14:19.897
Uh!

14:21.464 --> 14:23.067
(Cami): It's a trigger.

14:23.562 --> 14:25.135
You pulled yourself back,
which is improvement,

14:25.137 --> 14:26.753
for sure, but we can't ignore the fact

14:26.783 --> 14:28.565
that your mind clearly went elsewhere.

14:28.595 --> 14:31.621
It's very common in
traditional PTSD patients.

14:31.651 --> 14:34.263
You've done the work
to face your atrocities.

14:34.293 --> 14:37.356
The truth is, it's just going to take
some time to settle.

14:38.031 --> 14:39.183
And you believe you have the power

14:39.213 --> 14:40.300
to resolve this.

14:40.302 --> 14:43.209
- It's not that easy. There's no...
- (Snap)

14:43.239 --> 14:44.819
And you're fixed.

14:44.849 --> 14:46.924
In cases like yours, sometimes not dwelling

14:46.954 --> 14:48.522
on the problem is more productive

14:48.552 --> 14:51.509
than examining it through
the minutia of therapy,

14:51.539 --> 14:54.443
staying mentally busy
instead of physically.

14:54.746 --> 14:56.632
This house, though charming,

14:56.662 --> 14:59.592
is completely falling apart.

15:01.933 --> 15:03.754
So this is your solution.

15:03.784 --> 15:06.212
Mend the home, mend the man.

15:06.242 --> 15:09.032
Or we could go fishing, and I could tell 
you about the summer I lost my virginity.

15:09.062 --> 15:10.694
I'll mend the home.

15:10.962 --> 15:12.328
I'll spend the day with Hope,

15:12.358 --> 15:14.644
and you spend the day not thinking

15:14.914 --> 15:17.197
and fixing the heater because this place

15:17.227 --> 15:20.023
is freezing at night.

15:21.359 --> 15:23.720
(Children shouting)

15:24.622 --> 15:26.363
Jack...

15:31.969 --> 15:33.203
Ha ha!

15:33.205 --> 15:34.871
(Boy): He's not it. I'm it.

15:35.078 --> 15:36.186
Oh!

15:41.975 --> 15:43.763
Looks like I got some competition.

15:43.993 --> 15:45.041
Ha ha ha!

15:45.277 --> 15:46.945
Unfortunately for Daisy,

15:46.975 --> 15:49.751
I'm a one-woman kind of guy.

15:49.781 --> 15:51.945
Our meeting is taking place up at Mary's.

15:52.339 --> 15:53.578
Ok.

15:55.738 --> 15:58.378
You go ahead. I'll be right there.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.187
Uh! Whoa!

16:05.217 --> 16:07.114
Wait. I'm not here to hurt you.

16:07.144 --> 16:09.455
Well, stalking me is a very
funny way of showing it.

16:09.683 --> 16:11.993
You're lucky we're friends,
or I would've just killed you.

16:12.023 --> 16:13.408
Ok. Remember our friendship when

16:13.438 --> 16:15.026
I tell you why I'm here.

16:15.056 --> 16:17.026
Finn sent me to get your blood.

16:17.397 --> 16:19.166
Why would Finn want my blood?

16:19.196 --> 16:21.941
I assume he needs it for a locator spell

16:22.241 --> 16:25.565
to find your daughter.

16:27.789 --> 16:28.875
No.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.934
How does he know?

16:32.964 --> 16:34.161
Put two and two together.

16:34.191 --> 16:35.231
Where's Finn now?

16:35.261 --> 16:37.507
I don't know. He said he'd tell
me where to meet him later,

16:37.537 --> 16:38.533
but listen.

16:38.563 --> 16:40.069
I got to give him something.

16:40.071 --> 16:41.384
He's killing one of my guys every hour

16:41.414 --> 16:43.255
until he gets it.

16:44.248 --> 16:46.776
I need to call Klaus.

16:48.159 --> 16:49.796
You come simpering for brotherly love,

16:49.826 --> 16:51.163
and the whole time, you're plotting

16:51.193 --> 16:52.884
against me with that damn dagger.

16:52.914 --> 16:54.068
You're no better than Finn.

16:54.098 --> 16:54.934
Ah, and you threatening me

16:54.936 --> 16:56.666
makes you better than Finn, does it?

16:56.885 --> 16:58.567
The both of you just stop it.

16:58.597 --> 17:01.024
I came to you because you're my family,

17:01.054 --> 17:02.559
but I see whilst you and Rebekah

17:02.589 --> 17:04.186
and Elijah all hang portraits

17:04.217 --> 17:07.048
and share secrets, I'm the odd one out.

17:07.078 --> 17:08.146
You want to know where Finn is?

17:08.176 --> 17:09.359
You want to find a way to kill him?

17:09.390 --> 17:11.416
Then you can figure it out yourself.

17:11.673 --> 17:14.118
Rrgh! Ah! Uh!

17:14.121 --> 17:16.321
Aagh!

17:16.324 --> 17:18.624
(Panting)

17:19.459 --> 17:23.162
(Panting)

17:23.921 --> 17:26.464
Your stupid temper will be
the end of you one day.

17:28.631 --> 17:30.469
Just know that.

17:30.471 --> 17:33.805
(Cell phone vibrates)

17:33.807 --> 17:34.806
(Beep)

17:34.808 --> 17:36.822
What is it, Hayley?

17:39.646 --> 17:41.647
(Sobbing)

17:56.314 --> 17:58.330
- (Cell phone ringing)
- Uh...

18:01.350 --> 18:02.868
(Beep)

18:04.406 --> 18:05.550
Are you calling to gloat,

18:05.580 --> 18:07.741
you venomous, venomous animal?

18:07.771 --> 18:11.302
There's no need for such language.

18:12.297 --> 18:13.423
I'm calling with a proposition

18:13.453 --> 18:15.714
that might motivate
me to spare your life.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.018
You've got my interest.

18:20.020 --> 18:22.338
I need you to draw some of Klaus' blood.

18:22.368 --> 18:23.883
Bring me some in an hour,

18:24.271 --> 18:26.024
and I'll heal you.

18:34.060 --> 18:35.733
It would be my pleasure.

18:43.487 --> 18:45.187
(Music playing on radio)

19:16.925 --> 19:18.358
(Klaus): Pick up the damn phone, Elijah.

19:18.388 --> 19:19.645
Finn is trying to find Hope.

19:19.675 --> 19:20.768
She's safe.

19:20.798 --> 19:22.948
It'll take 100 witches
to break the cloaking spell.

19:22.978 --> 19:24.550
I would've said the same
about mother finding you,

19:24.580 --> 19:26.914
and yet a flock of starlings
later, and here we are.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.481
He won't let them get to her, Nik,

19:28.511 --> 19:29.993
but you need to remain calm.

19:30.023 --> 19:32.386
Our brother doesn't do calm.

19:33.867 --> 19:35.055
Uh!

19:35.057 --> 19:36.862
Agh!

19:40.324 --> 19:41.461
Uh!

19:41.463 --> 19:43.630
Oh, you're angry, are you?
Well, join the party.

19:43.632 --> 19:45.933
I've been here 1,000 years.

19:46.238 --> 19:48.936
Uh! D'agh!

19:49.313 --> 19:52.645
I was building that dagger
to protect myself against you, Nik.

19:52.675 --> 19:54.074
I'm not the bad guy

19:54.076 --> 19:56.143
in this chapter of our family's story.

19:57.145 --> 20:00.143
I'm the wronged. I'm the dead
but never mourned,

20:00.173 --> 20:02.560
and whilst you got everything
that you wanted,

20:02.590 --> 20:05.393
I got a family who didn't care if I lived

20:05.423 --> 20:08.388
- or if I died.
- Oh, shut up.

20:08.390 --> 20:11.752
We've all suffered!
We've all been wronged!

20:11.782 --> 20:13.927
Go on. Go on. Finish it off.

20:15.042 --> 20:16.997
Go on. Kill me.

20:20.718 --> 20:23.487
I'm not gonna kill you, you idiot.

20:23.743 --> 20:26.289
Despite your behavior,
you're still my brother.

20:28.458 --> 20:29.503
Oh...

20:29.533 --> 20:32.243
Yeah, just the one you dagger repeatedly.

20:32.273 --> 20:34.110
I've daggered all of you,

20:34.140 --> 20:36.288
each for your own good.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.906
If you don't agree with my motives, fine...

20:38.936 --> 20:41.012
I never claimed to be
the bastion of temperance...

20:41.042 --> 20:44.379
But stop this drivel about being
singled out and unloved.

20:44.409 --> 20:47.877
You are a Mikaelson.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.723
You're my blood,

20:51.769 --> 20:54.083
and I need you.

20:54.085 --> 20:56.752
I need you by my side.

20:59.955 --> 21:03.676
What does it even mean, Nik, hmm?

21:03.882 --> 21:06.812
You talk about family...
family this, family that.

21:06.842 --> 21:07.947
I haven't even earned the right

21:07.949 --> 21:09.640
to share your secrets, have I?

21:09.670 --> 21:14.520
No. You haven't, but by all means,

21:14.522 --> 21:18.378
brother, prove yourself.

21:19.073 --> 21:21.026
It's not too late.

21:35.915 --> 21:38.210
Finn wants your blood.

21:38.212 --> 21:40.885
He promised to heal
me if I delivered it.

21:40.915 --> 21:42.781
You know where he is?

21:42.783 --> 21:45.623
You've got to tell me why he wants it.

21:45.653 --> 21:46.873
Look, Nik.

21:46.903 --> 21:48.854
You've got to trust me
for once in your life,

21:48.856 --> 21:51.657
and I will stand by your side, I promise.

21:51.659 --> 21:53.525
You would risk your life to help me?

21:53.527 --> 21:55.027
I know enough about dark magic

21:55.029 --> 21:56.679
to know that I'm hexed.

22:00.265 --> 22:04.336
There's no reversing what
Finn's done to me,

22:04.338 --> 22:06.449
which makes him a murderer and a liar,

22:06.479 --> 22:08.545
and if I'm gonna die, I'll be damned

22:08.821 --> 22:11.147
if he gets what he wants.

22:13.263 --> 22:16.548
Finn has been dead to me for a long time.

22:16.550 --> 22:20.585
Tonight I intend to make that official.

22:20.587 --> 22:21.959
Help me.

22:21.989 --> 22:24.956
Then I will share my secret with you.

22:31.179 --> 22:35.267
He'll be in the bell tower
of the Saint Louis cathedral.

22:39.685 --> 22:43.569
Go inside my head. Find the spell.

22:44.732 --> 22:47.251
Let's finish this.

22:47.281 --> 22:49.781
D'aagh!

22:55.490 --> 22:59.176
Wolves are bonded by what
is most important to us...

22:59.206 --> 23:03.261
The earth of our territory,
the blood of our packs.

23:05.511 --> 23:07.066
We have a problem.

23:07.096 --> 23:10.025
- What's wrong?
- Too many ears...

23:12.059 --> 23:14.572
But I need some of your blood.

23:15.282 --> 23:18.837
It's... it's a stall. I'll explain later.

23:19.140 --> 23:22.191
Oh. Your timing is perfect.

23:24.663 --> 23:26.641
(Mary): Mixing these elements,

23:26.671 --> 23:30.096
we irrevocably bind
ourselves to one another,

23:30.126 --> 23:33.138
creating a new Crescent pack.

23:33.168 --> 23:35.449
I ask each one of you,

23:35.786 --> 23:38.463
do you renounce your alpha status?

24:02.994 --> 24:05.923
Well, where is he? Is this a trick?

24:06.866 --> 24:09.493
He said he'd be here, I swear.

24:12.293 --> 24:14.565
This is the remnant of a spell,

24:15.605 --> 24:17.223
ancient.

24:19.334 --> 24:20.326
It's impressive.

24:20.356 --> 24:23.617
Admire its artistry later.
Tell me what he's set in motion.

24:23.647 --> 24:27.563
Kol, what is that?

24:44.240 --> 24:45.240
(Chanting)

24:54.783 --> 24:57.884
(Rebekah): Runic tiles. What's it mean?

24:57.914 --> 25:02.436
It's the symbol for baby.

25:12.637 --> 25:14.775
That's it, isn't it?

25:16.074 --> 25:17.978
Your baby's still alive.

25:18.373 --> 25:20.464
(Rebekah): Finn tricked us
into running about all day

25:20.494 --> 25:22.347
thinking he was looking
for a way to find Hope.

25:22.377 --> 25:24.727
When he knew where she was all along.

25:27.045 --> 25:28.545
(Cell phone ringing)

25:34.392 --> 25:35.424
(Beep)

25:35.984 --> 25:38.065
- Niklaus.
- (Klaus, on phone): Finn knows about Hope,

25:38.095 --> 25:39.166
about everything.

25:39.168 --> 25:40.708
I don't know how long until he gets there,

25:40.738 --> 25:42.927
but he is on his way.

25:44.309 --> 25:46.166
Yes, remarkably well on his way,

25:46.196 --> 25:49.276
I would say, brother.

26:06.352 --> 26:08.022
(Cami): Hey, Elijah,

26:08.052 --> 26:10.045
I left my cell at the house like an idiot.

26:10.075 --> 26:14.154
Luckily, pay phones are still
a thing out here in the sticks.

26:19.210 --> 26:22.817
Um, anyway, we're heading home now.

26:30.971 --> 26:32.636
(Chuckles)

26:33.782 --> 26:35.253
I don't know if the pediatric ward

26:35.283 --> 26:36.375
would approve of Uncle Elijah

26:36.405 --> 26:39.978
using vampire blood to heal boo-boos.

26:41.972 --> 26:42.992
Cami is not answering.

26:43.022 --> 26:44.409
(Rebekah): Elijah will protect them.

26:44.439 --> 26:46.457
Finn is channeling both
our parents. He's too strong.

26:46.487 --> 26:48.716
We need to find a way
to sever his link to them.

26:48.746 --> 26:49.795
How do we do that?

26:49.825 --> 26:52.416
I can't sever the link,

26:52.446 --> 26:54.896
but there is something that we can try.

26:56.241 --> 26:58.291
It'll take power of our own....

26:59.744 --> 27:02.138
And a lot of it.

27:04.181 --> 27:07.164
(Chants)

27:11.084 --> 27:12.149
How'd you find me?

27:12.179 --> 27:14.473
Little help from our sister.

27:14.503 --> 27:16.106
Rebekah would never lower herself

27:16.136 --> 27:17.821
to wallow in your filth.

27:17.851 --> 27:20.177
We have more than one, you know,

27:21.480 --> 27:25.205
and I get the sense she
doesn't like you all that much.

27:26.633 --> 27:28.455
- Freya.
- (Finn): Mother warned me

27:28.485 --> 27:29.651
Dahlia would kill us all

27:29.681 --> 27:32.214
to acquire another firstborn Mikaelson,

27:32.244 --> 27:35.426
and me, I'm in no mood to die.

27:37.424 --> 27:40.814
(Hayley): Klaus said it was all just 
a plan to keep us distracted.

27:40.844 --> 27:42.748
He's going after her. I have to get there.

27:42.778 --> 27:45.239
Wait. You said so yourself.
It's 6 hours away.

27:45.269 --> 27:46.436
Finn's already there.

27:46.466 --> 27:48.509
I can't just stand here
and do nothing, Marcel.

27:48.539 --> 27:50.638
Hayley, listen to me.
There is no way that Elijah

27:50.668 --> 27:54.278
is gonna let anything happen 
to your baby girl today.

27:54.308 --> 27:59.749
So go help Jackson build the army
that'll help keep her safe tomorrow.

28:14.773 --> 28:17.132
(All moaning)

28:19.803 --> 28:21.338
Uh...

28:28.774 --> 28:30.374
Where the hell are we?

28:32.310 --> 28:34.317
I smell blood.

28:41.075 --> 28:44.907
Cowering behind your witchcraft.
You always were pathetic, Finn.

28:44.937 --> 28:47.647
After nearly a millennium
of dishonorable acts

28:47.677 --> 28:49.383
hidden away in your own mind,

28:49.413 --> 28:52.137
you have the audacity to call me names.

28:52.167 --> 28:53.536
Ha!

28:54.181 --> 28:56.611
What I do now I do for
the members of my family

28:56.641 --> 28:58.174
who can still be saved.

28:58.616 --> 29:01.407
Unfortunately, neither you nor Niklaus
managed to make that list.

29:03.957 --> 29:05.255
Huh!

29:09.053 --> 29:10.787
Huh! Uh!

29:11.125 --> 29:14.123
Aah! Uh! Uh!

29:15.269 --> 29:16.692
Ah!

29:35.313 --> 29:37.385
(Kol): We can't get in without Finn's blood.

29:37.415 --> 29:38.614
(Rebekah): Well, how do we disrupt Finn

29:38.616 --> 29:40.183
from channeling our parents in there

29:40.185 --> 29:41.994
if we can't even get to
the bloody binding circle?

29:42.024 --> 29:44.520
We're not here to disrupt Finn's power.

29:44.522 --> 29:46.062
We're trying to overload it.

29:46.092 --> 29:48.988
Are you daft? You want
to make him stronger?

29:49.018 --> 29:52.534
Look. A witch can only ever 
channel so much power.

29:52.564 --> 29:54.597
After this, things start to get ugly.

29:54.599 --> 29:57.438
I mean, you literally start 
to disintegratefrom the inside.

29:57.468 --> 30:01.584
He'll either have to release 
the power or, well, let it kill him.

30:01.614 --> 30:03.339
But he won't be dead. 
He'll just body-jump.

30:03.341 --> 30:09.122
Yes, into a body 300 miles away
from the niece that he's trying to nab.

30:09.494 --> 30:11.145
(Chuckles)

30:11.175 --> 30:15.191
In case you're wondering,
this is the side of you I like.

30:20.700 --> 30:22.491
Look. I am...

30:25.415 --> 30:28.631
I'm gonna get you back in your body, Bex,

30:29.022 --> 30:31.367
if it's the last thing I do, I promise.

30:32.662 --> 30:34.136
Right now, just worry about how in blazes

30:34.138 --> 30:35.769
I'm gonna be any use to you whatsoever

30:35.799 --> 30:37.239
when I know nothing about magic.

30:37.241 --> 30:39.572
You don't need to know
anything about magic.

30:39.602 --> 30:41.439
I'm just gonna have to channel you.

30:43.018 --> 30:45.475
Did you get me what I asked for?

30:45.505 --> 30:48.072
Mystical artifacts and dark objects galore

30:48.102 --> 30:49.701
from my own personal collection

30:49.703 --> 30:51.703
garnered over 1,000 years.

30:51.705 --> 30:54.578
I wondered where this had gone.
Half this stuff is mine.

30:54.608 --> 30:57.056
There's more.

31:09.616 --> 31:11.445
You want to trust me with this?

31:11.475 --> 31:13.275
Whatever you need.

31:15.794 --> 31:17.695
Whatever it takes.

31:18.470 --> 31:22.601
All right. Let's get started.

31:32.244 --> 31:34.991
(Scraping)

31:44.048 --> 31:46.124
After the anointing of the alphas

31:46.126 --> 31:48.792
will be the final seal of our...

32:02.136 --> 32:03.474
Gia, you don't have to do this.

32:03.476 --> 32:06.537
Sorry, but I do. Raah!

32:08.113 --> 32:09.947
Huh! No!

32:09.949 --> 32:11.202
- (Crack) 
- Uh!

32:11.232 --> 32:14.953
We just need to keep them
at bay until Finn's spell breaks.

32:14.983 --> 32:16.020
It's a hell of a spell.

32:16.022 --> 32:18.289
Get the alphas in the cabin.
I'll hold them off.

32:18.291 --> 32:19.624
Try to keep my guys alive.

32:19.626 --> 32:22.154
Ditto. Uh! Uh!

32:22.629 --> 32:24.162
(Crack)

32:28.367 --> 32:29.670
(Slam)

32:30.987 --> 32:32.220
(Glass shatters)

32:32.222 --> 32:33.655
Marcel, you got any idea how to end this?

32:33.657 --> 32:36.648
Just weather the storm
until we figure that out.

33:07.190 --> 33:11.977
Where are you, Camille?
There's no use in hiding.

33:20.941 --> 33:26.633
(Kol and Rebekah chanting)

33:33.680 --> 33:35.248
We're close.

33:35.326 --> 33:38.764
We just need something
to put it over the top.

33:40.466 --> 33:41.714
Take me.

33:43.855 --> 33:47.711
I am a vampire-werewolf hybrid with
10 centuries of blood on my hands.

33:47.741 --> 33:49.462
- Channel me.
- No, Nik.

33:49.492 --> 33:51.626
You wanted my trust, brother.

33:51.879 --> 33:53.581
Here it is.

34:00.091 --> 34:01.995
Do not fail me.

34:48.259 --> 34:51.594
I know you're in here, Camille.

34:51.597 --> 34:54.931
- (Whoosh) 
- Uh! Ah!

34:55.704 --> 34:57.234
(Moaning)

35:01.394 --> 35:03.006
Uh!

35:03.036 --> 35:07.341
(Chanting)

35:08.833 --> 35:10.730
(Chanting)

35:14.537 --> 35:16.007
(Chants)

35:18.823 --> 35:20.515
D'ah!

35:27.318 --> 35:28.318
Uh!

36:02.138 --> 36:05.294
(Chanting)

36:05.636 --> 36:08.078
Aah!

36:08.108 --> 36:10.039
(Chanting)

36:12.376 --> 36:14.110
Yaah!

36:14.112 --> 36:16.545
Aah! Aah!

36:16.547 --> 36:19.181
Aah!

36:19.183 --> 36:22.035
Uh! Uh! Yah!

36:22.385 --> 36:24.053
Uh!

36:25.493 --> 36:27.556
I don't want to kill you, Gia.

36:29.461 --> 36:30.843
Uh!

36:38.977 --> 36:40.903
They broke the spell.

36:42.861 --> 36:46.676
You're a genius, you glorious bastard.

36:50.183 --> 36:52.948
I'm a littleurprised it worked myself.

36:54.073 --> 36:56.393
(Coughing)

36:58.822 --> 37:01.557
- Kol?
- (Coughs)

37:03.573 --> 37:07.529
Listen. I am not gonna let you die,

37:08.599 --> 37:10.399
you hear me...

37:11.989 --> 37:14.570
Whatever it takes.

37:19.169 --> 37:20.876
(Jackson): Hayley...

37:37.595 --> 37:40.342
Hope will be all right.
Elijah will protect her.

37:40.372 --> 37:43.098
I know it... but, Jack, this stuff,

37:43.100 --> 37:45.934
these attacks, they're
only gonna get worse.

37:49.994 --> 37:53.742
We need to get married 
as soon as possible.

37:56.746 --> 37:57.726
Uh...

37:57.756 --> 38:00.067
(Panting)

38:01.490 --> 38:03.490
Tell me it worked.

38:03.520 --> 38:06.260
We did our bit, I promise.

38:06.290 --> 38:10.686
Finn is back to being a normal,
regular-strength, maniacal bastard.

38:12.208 --> 38:15.855
I know in the last millennium,
we haven't always seen eye to eye,

38:15.885 --> 38:19.188
but in this moment,
I am reminded once again

38:19.218 --> 38:23.557
of something Elijah has always said.

38:27.896 --> 38:31.012
Family is power.

38:37.483 --> 38:39.141
Thank you.

38:42.215 --> 38:44.392
You're welcome.

38:44.394 --> 38:47.163
Speaking of Elijah...

38:47.894 --> 38:51.551
He will prevail. Of that I have no doubt.

39:14.334 --> 39:16.718
(Footsteps)

39:24.956 --> 39:27.568
(Hope fussing)

39:28.563 --> 39:30.805
It's ok. It's ok.

39:32.154 --> 39:35.180
(Cami humming)

39:36.462 --> 39:38.746
(Finn): Look at you, brother.

39:38.748 --> 39:43.668
You're a mess, and, as we both know,
untidiness is your undoing.

39:47.810 --> 39:51.519
Tell me, do your soiled clothes

39:51.549 --> 39:54.428
serve as a reminder
of your filthy memories,

39:55.345 --> 39:57.079
your many sins?

39:57.433 --> 40:01.402
Are you having bad memories now, brother,

40:01.404 --> 40:04.274
perhaps of the innocent Tatia...

40:05.533 --> 40:07.307
Or any one of the other poor souls

40:07.309 --> 40:10.277
who met their fate at your hands?

40:18.160 --> 40:20.387
That's a shame, really, because, in a way,

40:20.389 --> 40:22.723
the child is just another
one of your victims.

40:23.248 --> 40:25.225
Had you the will to stand against me,

40:25.227 --> 40:27.227
you might have saved her,
but because she was left

40:27.229 --> 40:30.927
under the protection of a wretch, a beast

40:30.957 --> 40:35.653
that basks in the blood of others,
she will die.

40:37.675 --> 40:41.518
I suppose your little niece
never really had a chance.

40:47.742 --> 40:49.516
(Engine stops)

40:56.057 --> 40:57.490
(Sighs)

41:04.660 --> 41:05.988
(Finn): I'd ask for a response,

41:06.018 --> 41:07.817
but I wouldn't want to taint myself

41:07.819 --> 41:12.161
with the vulgar refuse that must, 
even now, be flashing through your mind.

41:16.261 --> 41:20.330
Let me assure you, 
my mind is quite clear...

41:21.783 --> 41:23.438
Much like the gas which has pervaded

41:23.468 --> 41:25.435
every single room in this home

41:25.437 --> 41:26.532
whilst you have been ranting

41:26.562 --> 41:29.814
like the lunatic that you are.

41:30.663 --> 41:35.808
You have disgraced this family
for the last time.

41:39.883 --> 41:41.507
Goodbye, brother.

41:44.527 --> 41:46.449
Oh my God!
