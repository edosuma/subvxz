I'M ALIVE.

24:54.243 --> 24:55.786
HE HAS NO SEX DRIVE.

24:55.786 --> 24:57.496
THE ONLY THING HE CARES ABOUT
IS THE DAMN BABIES.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.625
- KEV MOVED OUT?

25:21.812 --> 25:23.981
THEN HE STARTED YELLING AT ME
BECAUSE THEY WERE CRYING,

25:23.981 --> 25:25.483
LIKE IT WAS ONLY MY FAULT,

25:25.483 --> 25:27.443
AND THE ONLY WAY
I CAN GET HIM TO EVEN LOOK AT ME

25:27.443 --> 25:29.570
IS IF I KNOCK HIM
UPSIDE THE HEAD WITH A PAN.

25:29.570 --> 25:31.615

WITH A PAN?

25:31.615 --> 25:33.032

HE TOOK THEM TO THE PARK

25:44.835 --> 25:47.463
