01:09.583 --> 01:11.022
Once upon a time,

01:11.155 --> 01:15.138
there was a traveler on horseback
who finds himself facing a swamp.

01:15.538 --> 01:18.708
And he doesn't know whether to
go around or try to wade through.

01:20.961 --> 01:23.157
The traveler asks a local boy:

01:23.306 --> 01:26.921
"Tell me, local boy. Does the
swamp have a hard bottom ?"

01:27.478 --> 01:29.368
And the boy tells him that it does.

01:31.632 --> 01:34.314
So the traveler guides his horse into the swamp

01:34.519 --> 01:38.498
and they begin to sink deeper
and deeper into the muck.

01:39.343 --> 01:40.817
He shouts to the boy:

01:41.069 --> 01:42.992
"I thought you said it has a hard bottom !"

01:44.191 --> 01:45.508
And the boy says:

01:45.630 --> 01:48.686
"It does, Mr. Traveler.
You're just not there yet."

01:49.158 --> 01:51.902
- Today ?
- Today ! That's why I promoted you.

01:52.353 --> 01:54.109
And the sinking begins.

01:54.202 --> 01:57.559
I noticed that you haven't signed
up for the annual Happy Time retreat.

01:57.945 --> 01:58.932
Right.

01:59.128 --> 02:01.990
The sign-up sheet is firmly
taped to the microwave, Millie.

02:02.128 --> 02:03.095
Have you not seen it ?

02:03.511 --> 02:06.264
No, I saw the sheet, it's just that...

02:09.854 --> 02:13.162
A night in the woods with these
freaks scares me more than being dead.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.925
We only retreat once a year.
That's what makes it annual.

02:17.033 --> 02:18.211
Why retreat at all ?

02:19.194 --> 02:20.320
Who's attacking us ?

02:21.488 --> 02:22.635
Always the cute joke.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.509
that's your defense mechanism.

02:24.729 --> 02:25.845
- What ?
- Sarcasm.

02:25.999 --> 02:28.247
That's how you keep people at a safe distance.

02:28.605 --> 02:29.695
No, I don't.

02:29.793 --> 02:30.621
You do.

02:30.622 --> 02:32.175
You use humor.

02:32.245 --> 02:36.799
For others, it's aggressive body
piercings and facial tattoos.

02:38.781 --> 02:40.251
Thanks, Skitter.

02:41.506 --> 02:43.643
I'm not trying to distance anybody.

02:43.837 --> 02:46.935
I mean look at your cubicle.
It's as bare as a...

02:47.202 --> 02:48.656
pop star’s midriff.

02:48.722 --> 02:51.098
I enjoy a clutter-free workspace.

02:51.452 --> 02:54.585
Not a single photo of a friend or family...

02:54.965 --> 02:56.059
Make me sad.

02:56.285 --> 02:57.221
Hey guys !

02:57.222 --> 02:58.060
Juice barn run.

02:58.061 --> 03:01.599
Oh Todd ! Count me in. I can't risk
another low-blood sugar episode today.

03:01.923 --> 03:02.899
Are you in, Millie ?

03:04.268 --> 03:05.876
Millie, Millie...

03:06.198 --> 03:07.975
Would it kill you to be part of the team ?

03:08.666 --> 03:11.575
It's just I've got so much work to do, Dolores.

03:11.672 --> 03:12.958
And it's half-day for me so...

03:13.059 --> 03:16.449
Well half-days are one thing but
half-ass commitment to your coworkers

03:16.551 --> 03:17.858
is quite another.

03:18.881 --> 03:22.204
Now, if I don't go get
that Raspberry Razzmatazz,

03:22.255 --> 03:24.016
I can't be held responsible for my actions.

03:24.268 --> 03:25.233
Really.

03:25.352 --> 03:26.347
Legally !

03:38.650 --> 03:41.288
How could I tell Dolores that
it was hard to play for her team

03:41.360 --> 03:43.776
when I had already been
drafted by the other side ?

03:45.779 --> 03:48.261
And with the new membership,
we offer 2 personal training sets.

03:48.846 --> 03:50.356
Can we take them with this one ?

03:50.781 --> 03:51.732
Diego ?

03:52.650 --> 03:53.575
Of course.

03:53.576 --> 03:55.086
I wander if he makes house calls.

03:55.245 --> 03:56.321
Use your español.

04:02.779 --> 04:05.887
Ladies, I'm Brazilian. I speak Portuguese.

04:06.505 --> 04:07.524
That doesn't make any sense.

04:07.929 --> 04:08.850
Pardon me !

04:09.424 --> 04:10.366
Excuse me !

04:13.623 --> 04:15.526
Say something in Portuguese for me.

04:15.609 --> 04:17.478
Did you go to the gym when you were alive ?

04:17.933 --> 04:19.260
I died in 1938.

04:19.337 --> 04:21.911
For exercise, we drank Slow
Gins and smoked Lucky Strikes.

04:22.045 --> 04:23.874
Hi ! Would you like to try a Rev'N UP bar ?

04:23.991 --> 04:26.039
It's free, 15 grams of proteins,
loads of fiber.

04:27.816 --> 04:28.803
No, thanks.

04:29.675 --> 04:31.113
What do you think of these guys ?

04:31.527 --> 04:33.079
- For what ?
- Millie's family !

04:34.897 --> 04:37.974
Well, they're very attractive
and they look republican.

04:38.251 --> 04:39.162
You think ?

04:39.373 --> 04:40.428
Yeah, isn't that what you are ?

04:40.534 --> 04:41.508
No !

04:41.554 --> 04:43.464
I never voted but I'm not that !

04:43.791 --> 04:45.609
- What were you ?
- I was an actress.

04:46.714 --> 04:48.497
Well, I like the way they look.

04:48.892 --> 04:50.647
Confident. Like winners.

04:55.624 --> 04:56.925
What kind of rackets are they holding ?

05:01.039 --> 05:01.954
Squash.

05:10.167 --> 05:11.267
What just happened ?

05:12.057 --> 05:13.214
He dropped the barbell.

05:14.129 --> 05:15.445
Nice going, Zoé !

05:15.789 --> 05:18.061
You just had to add an extra
pin to your map, didn't you ?

05:18.312 --> 05:19.665
Just had to have one more country.

05:19.916 --> 05:20.760
Oh really ?

05:20.761 --> 05:23.360
And that's not why you nailed
that Mohammed guy last week ?

05:24.544 --> 05:25.481
Can we change ?

05:25.794 --> 05:26.889
It's something tailored ?

05:27.145 --> 05:28.865
I'm afraid it's casual death day.

05:31.047 --> 05:34.488
Tell me when I do that,
use humor to distance myself.

05:35.307 --> 05:37.027
You're doing it so say something nice.

05:38.982 --> 05:40.605
I'm sorry that you died.

05:42.357 --> 05:43.761
At least, you have each other.

05:44.292 --> 05:45.501
At least, you're together.

05:48.855 --> 05:49.864
No, I don't get it.

05:50.269 --> 05:51.348
Millie's parents.

05:52.097 --> 05:54.405
Those people are supposed
to be related to you ?

05:54.933 --> 05:57.062
Round robin tennis bullshit.

05:57.350 --> 06:00.453
They're related to Millie. Happy Time Millie.

06:02.420 --> 06:03.633
They look like drinkers.

06:03.867 --> 06:05.138
They look like Catholics.

06:05.389 --> 06:06.929
They look like they wouldn't like me.

06:07.651 --> 06:09.622
What are you trying to say about my family ?

06:09.987 --> 06:11.195
They know what I'm trying to say.

06:12.056 --> 06:13.771
I don't think I care for the implication.

06:13.857 --> 06:17.590
I just don't understand why you want
that frosty tennis bitch to be your mom.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.154
This is not her family. Why are we
talking about them as if they are ?

06:20.247 --> 06:23.069
It's not just about tennis.
That's all I'm saying.

06:23.155 --> 06:24.063
Well, they don't exist.

06:25.077 --> 06:26.377
And that's a squash racket.

06:26.470 --> 06:27.871
- Do you play squash ?
- No.

06:28.016 --> 06:29.193
I think I'd be good at it.

06:29.408 --> 06:30.914
- Really ?
- No.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.115
Would you like to enlighten me
as to the point of the picture ?

06:33.254 --> 06:35.383
Everybody else has pictures on their desks.

06:35.669 --> 06:37.160
At Happy Time. I don't.

06:37.309 --> 06:39.842
I just want Dolores off my case.
She says I don't fit in.

06:40.232 --> 06:41.288
Dolores is right.

06:41.896 --> 06:44.036
It's a little late in the game to start.

06:44.134 --> 06:45.102
I don't wanna fit in.

06:45.230 --> 06:46.565
I just don't wanna stand out.

06:46.920 --> 06:47.888
Okay, I'll buy that.

06:48.783 --> 06:49.748
Here you go.

06:53.857 --> 06:57.426
I can't believe you guys fell
for this Waffle Haus club crap.

06:57.538 --> 06:59.219
Six more punches and I get a free waffle.

06:59.331 --> 07:01.461
- I only got eight more to go.
- Seven !

07:01.707 --> 07:02.864
And I hate waffles.

07:03.545 --> 07:04.881
Your next waffle is free.

07:05.721 --> 07:07.154
I've been ravenous lately.

07:07.282 --> 07:09.950
It's the whole undead metabolism thing.
I don't know.

07:10.535 --> 07:11.609
Are you sure you don't want a card ?

07:11.989 --> 07:14.349
Thank you, Kiffany but
it's really not my thing.

07:16.561 --> 07:19.903
Whatever everyone else was doing,
I always went the other way.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.548
I wasn't a joiner.

07:22.061 --> 07:24.124
Maybe that's just the way I was brought up.

07:36.739 --> 07:39.050
Georgia. Georgia ! Shhh ! They'll hear you !

07:39.265 --> 07:40.197
Sweaty...

07:41.358 --> 07:43.238
Why do we pretend not to be here ?

07:43.499 --> 07:46.428
Because we don't want them coming
back and singing every night.

07:46.689 --> 07:48.419
They'll want us top join them.

07:48.645 --> 07:49.611
Okay.

07:50.253 --> 07:51.592
Georgia, what are you doing ?
Where are you going ?

07:51.733 --> 07:52.731
Georgia, get back here !

07:52.829 --> 07:54.895
- Clancy !
- Georgia, get back here or...

07:55.208 --> 07:56.586
Or there'll be no Santa Claus for you.

07:56.781 --> 07:58.025
You don't scare me.

08:05.618 --> 08:06.720
Shut up !

08:08.127 --> 08:09.909
We want a silent night.

08:12.770 --> 08:14.487
No ! Stop it !

08:16.074 --> 08:17.145
And never come back !

08:22.803 --> 08:23.728
Coast is clear.

08:24.354 --> 08:25.326
Good job, sweaty.

08:25.383 --> 08:26.362
Thanks.

08:29.132 --> 08:30.662
And it wasn't just caroling.

08:30.754 --> 08:33.817
Faced with any kind of activity,
my parents went the other way.

08:34.385 --> 08:35.582
Ran the other way.

08:36.407 --> 08:37.898
We were a group of loners.

08:38.471 --> 08:39.609
If they were options,

08:39.914 --> 08:41.701
chances are we'd opt out.

08:42.481 --> 08:45.111
But being undead and
unmotivated at the workplace,

08:45.184 --> 08:48.593
I had a lot of time on my hands to
think about the "what if" of life.

08:52.905 --> 08:54.865
Like what if I hadn't dropped out of college ?

08:55.326 --> 08:56.853
Would I still have died ?

08:57.319 --> 08:58.959
What if I had had a different family ?

08:59.208 --> 09:01.383
A family that didn't always opt out.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.746
And God blesseth everyone !

09:21.865 --> 09:22.798
Think fast !

09:23.539 --> 09:25.674
I'm sorry about that. I caught you off-guard.

09:25.849 --> 09:27.584
I'm Greg, the retreat facilitator.

09:28.209 --> 09:29.888
I'm Millie, just Millie.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.984
I'm afraid, she's not with us.

09:33.064 --> 09:35.926
I don't really play games. I'm not really gamy.

09:36.330 --> 09:38.696
You know, everyone has something
to contribute to the team.

09:39.366 --> 09:41.855
Don't you wanna be alone with
nature and your fellow workers ?

09:42.065 --> 09:43.668
Nop, can't. Bed-wetter.

09:43.939 --> 09:46.115
Oh... It's too bad.

09:46.638 --> 09:47.592
I'm kidding.

09:47.723 --> 09:50.313
But I'm really not going. Really.

09:51.261 --> 09:53.749
You know, I'm sure that this one will fit.

09:53.801 --> 09:54.861
I'm sure it's your size. Just...

09:55.537 --> 09:57.585
Not really a group hat person either.

09:59.059 --> 10:00.975
Well, you're not a lot of things, are you ?

10:01.758 --> 10:04.390
I'm not even alive so let's lose the attitude.

10:04.477 --> 10:07.246
Alright well, you know,
you have fun holding down the fort.

10:11.307 --> 10:13.320
But I didn't wanna hold down the fort.

10:14.252 --> 10:15.475
The fort is for losers.

10:16.068 --> 10:17.774
The fort's a pain in the ass.

10:20.395 --> 10:22.618
Reggie ! Dinner !

10:23.038 --> 10:23.945
I'm coming !

10:24.692 --> 10:26.437
- Did you straighten you room ?
- Yes !

10:26.914 --> 10:29.305
- Did you put everything away ?
- Yes !

10:29.704 --> 10:32.424
- Is it spotless ?
- Spotless !

10:40.073 --> 10:43.027
Reggie ! Why are you unfolding that napkin ?

10:44.671 --> 10:46.284
Because I'm eating dinner ?

10:46.657 --> 10:47.752
This isn't for us.

10:47.867 --> 10:50.370
This is for the realtor and a
couple she's bringing by tomorrow.

10:51.010 --> 10:52.172
You're making them dinner ?

10:52.284 --> 10:54.000
I'm making it look like a dinner party.

10:54.619 --> 10:56.924
Buyers wanna see a place
where they might entertain.

10:57.395 --> 10:58.692
We never entertain.

10:59.571 --> 11:01.010
It's just for show.

11:01.374 --> 11:04.615
It's like a... It's like a serving suggestion.

11:06.719 --> 11:07.805
Where's our dinner ?

11:09.126 --> 11:11.430
I got us Burger Round-Up !

11:12.311 --> 11:13.443
You and I get to do a picnic !

11:19.894 --> 11:20.870
This is bullshit !

11:20.876 --> 11:22.453
Putting food on the floor
doesn't make it a picnic.

11:22.853 --> 11:24.534
Please don't swear !

11:26.755 --> 11:28.302
This is how homeless people eat !

11:31.026 --> 11:35.808
Well, I'm gonna enjoy my Round-Up
with cheese whether you join me or not.

11:36.094 --> 11:37.011
Not.

11:38.568 --> 11:39.648
I'm going in my room.

11:40.220 --> 11:41.507
You're sleeping with me tonight.

11:41.599 --> 11:43.595
I already made your bed and
I want it to stay that way.

11:43.826 --> 11:45.786
It's my room ! You snore !

11:47.487 --> 11:50.488
I mean it, Reggie ! You'd better
not be messing up that bed.

11:50.883 --> 11:51.819
I mean it !

11:56.524 --> 11:57.470
Working double today ?

11:57.851 --> 11:58.628
That's rough.

11:58.629 --> 12:00.017
I don't mind, keeps me out of trouble.

12:00.529 --> 12:02.434
- You want a piece of cherry pie, sweaty ?
- Sure.

12:02.531 --> 12:04.707
Well, you ever wait tables ? That's harder
than digging a ditch, you should try.

12:04.774 --> 12:07.038
You'd see what a real job is.
It is a noble vocation.

12:07.180 --> 12:08.579
My dogs are barking.

12:09.352 --> 12:10.205
I have a real job.

12:10.206 --> 12:11.221
I have two real jobs.

12:11.788 --> 12:15.353
So... I think I'm gonna go on
the Happy Time retreat tomorrow.

12:16.662 --> 12:17.653
Pie is nice.

12:18.143 --> 12:19.061
Did you hear me ?

12:19.105 --> 12:20.041
When I was you age,

12:20.514 --> 12:23.218
I used to treat the crust like it was
just here to hold the good stuff in.

12:23.776 --> 12:25.455
I used to leave the whole
back end of it on a plate.

12:26.066 --> 12:27.129
Because I got older,

12:27.529 --> 12:29.685
I learnt to appreciate the crust.

12:30.643 --> 12:32.383
To stand on the outside looking in,

12:32.475 --> 12:35.291
it's not really the best way to lay low.

12:36.367 --> 12:38.746
The more I stay out of the group,
the more they notice me...

12:39.444 --> 12:40.489
That's bad.

12:40.786 --> 12:43.141
You'll learn that the crust and
pie have too different recipes.

12:43.326 --> 12:44.687
Ultimately they commingle but

12:45.126 --> 12:48.476
they are very separate entities.

12:48.784 --> 12:50.673
I'm saying I'm gonna go.

12:50.975 --> 12:53.402
It's... the right thing to do, okay ?

12:53.581 --> 12:56.112
Okay, you've decided. What do you need me for ?

12:56.485 --> 12:58.948
I need the day off tomorrow.
Can you cover for me ?

12:59.019 --> 13:01.063
You know, George, reaping is not like
some waitresses trading their shifts.

13:01.635 --> 13:03.285
The noble vocation.

13:03.381 --> 13:04.540
I don't need your smart mouth.

13:05.220 --> 13:07.073
- It's serious business.
- Serious business.

13:09.306 --> 13:10.356
I need to know where you are.

13:10.422 --> 13:12.562
You are like an E.R. doc.
Do you understand that ? You're on call.

13:12.619 --> 13:14.278
You're on call 24/7.

13:14.375 --> 13:16.619
- 365 !
- I don't need you smart mouth !

13:16.715 --> 13:17.705
Sorry.

13:18.892 --> 13:20.877
- I changed my mind.
- I think that's wise.

13:21.178 --> 13:22.967
Not about the retreat. About the pie.

13:23.218 --> 13:25.062
So I'll see you when I get back.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.274
- You want it ?
- Yeah, please.

13:31.113 --> 13:33.002
- More coffee ?
- Please.

13:39.306 --> 13:40.283
What are you doing ?

13:42.797 --> 13:43.733
It's for the aroma.

13:43.801 --> 13:46.070
Honey, this couple is ready
to pay more than we'd even ask.

13:46.286 --> 13:47.395
So, let's put on a show here.

13:48.424 --> 13:49.401
What kind of show ?

13:49.911 --> 13:51.319
A good one.

13:51.589 --> 13:54.384
So let's smile and be friendly,
make them feel welcome.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.223
Why don't you just make the cookies ?

13:56.318 --> 13:57.284
Reggie, get the door !

14:15.579 --> 14:16.498
Hey !

14:19.098 --> 14:20.402
Let me ask you something, Millie.

14:20.704 --> 14:23.831
Would you screw a Mustang Grill to 57 Chevy ?

14:24.103 --> 14:25.619
- Me ? No.
- Exactly !

14:25.783 --> 14:27.412
You don't mess with the classics.

14:27.498 --> 14:30.114
So when I say "get the fixings for Smores"

14:30.243 --> 14:33.315
you don't show up with
Annie Hall chocolate bar.

14:33.858 --> 14:36.454
Smore is like a delicate eco-system.

14:36.716 --> 14:40.498
Graham cracker, marshmallow and
the great American Hershey bar.

14:41.651 --> 14:43.741
I'm sorry, I'm not a camper.

14:43.888 --> 14:46.771
Hey ! I'm really happy you
decided to join us, Millie.

14:46.858 --> 14:49.966
You just... need to get
your head in the game, huh ?

14:51.133 --> 14:52.074
Come on.

14:53.787 --> 14:55.920
Hey ! Back in the truck !

14:56.378 --> 14:57.306
Go on !

14:58.548 --> 14:59.449
Fucking mutt !

14:59.665 --> 15:02.183
Oh the great outdoors ! Brisk !

15:03.199 --> 15:04.127
Feel that ?

15:04.762 --> 15:06.858
That's the I.Q. falling ?

15:07.546 --> 15:10.417
Goddamn dog ! It'll just soon
fuck a duck that hunt one !

15:11.002 --> 15:14.011
I meant to say "go team" !
Hershey bars or bust !

15:14.288 --> 15:16.633
Although I don't care for
the cruelty to animals.

15:16.929 --> 15:17.896
They're hunters.

15:20.683 --> 15:21.656
Hershey bars ?

15:28.015 --> 15:31.036
Nice 12 gage ! Daddy had one of those.

15:31.129 --> 15:32.054
Excuse me !

15:32.055 --> 15:33.006
Full choke.

15:33.198 --> 15:36.080
- Is it duck hunting season already ?
- Yeah, whatever.

15:36.289 --> 15:37.913
Weight loss drinks.

15:46.217 --> 15:48.261
Most hunters are morning people.

15:49.428 --> 15:50.750
They have Hershey bars.

15:50.897 --> 15:53.597
That's what I like to hear, Millie.
Let's load 'em up !

15:56.045 --> 15:57.221
Hi Linda !

15:57.334 --> 15:59.311
- Oh great boots !
- Thank you.

15:59.550 --> 16:01.721
Joy, these are the Cawps, Andy and Stephanie.

16:01.948 --> 16:02.887
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:03.067 --> 16:03.984
This is Reggie.

16:05.439 --> 16:06.364
Hello.

16:07.243 --> 16:08.174
Great place.

16:08.854 --> 16:10.463
- Are you baking ?
- I am.

16:10.944 --> 16:13.807
The Cawps are very interested in this property.

16:13.934 --> 16:16.408
As you can see, they're in
need of a little more space.

16:18.246 --> 16:19.336
Ever since she got...

16:19.506 --> 16:20.850
I mean since we got...

16:21.307 --> 16:22.219
you know...

16:22.776 --> 16:24.481
I never know exactly how to say it.

16:24.707 --> 16:26.305
Say "since I impregnated her".

16:26.469 --> 16:27.688
Take full responsibility.

16:27.989 --> 16:29.234
Unless of course it's not yours.

16:32.772 --> 16:36.725
Just look at the period treasures
that they have preserved.

16:36.792 --> 16:40.073
All of the crown moldings,
the original hardware.

16:40.616 --> 16:41.564
Nice.

16:41.686 --> 16:44.405
Modern amenities as well.
These are all dual pane windows.

16:44.488 --> 16:46.085
I insisted on those for safety.

16:46.689 --> 16:49.187
I was pregnant with my daughter
when we bought the house.

16:50.463 --> 16:51.936
And I'm guessing that's you ?

16:52.137 --> 16:53.070
Guess again.

16:54.011 --> 16:55.070
That was her sister.

16:55.414 --> 16:57.010
- George.
- George ?

16:57.579 --> 16:58.565
Georgia.

16:59.597 --> 17:00.635
Pretty name.

17:01.357 --> 17:04.252
This really is the perfect
home for a growing family.

17:04.742 --> 17:07.135
Reggie, why don't you
show the Cawps your room ?

17:07.345 --> 17:09.217
- Do I get a commission ?
- Reggie !

17:09.864 --> 17:12.260
I'd love it if you'd take
us to see your room, Reggie.

17:16.874 --> 17:17.832
Okay.

17:21.536 --> 17:22.936
Very interested.

17:28.031 --> 17:29.015
You.

17:29.486 --> 17:30.523
You.

17:33.958 --> 17:35.681
Route 9 and Gentilly Boulevard.

17:35.936 --> 17:38.067
Slippery pits. Biker hot spot.

17:38.287 --> 17:39.967
If you need an escort, let me know.

17:40.078 --> 17:41.973
You're very sweat but I can handle myself.

17:42.475 --> 17:44.764
Well, they're bikers not vampires, Daisy.

17:45.199 --> 17:47.846
Don't let the blond looks deceive you,
I'm a very powerful woman.

17:48.025 --> 17:48.989
Good for you.

17:49.393 --> 17:51.171
I'm gonna have to take a little time off today.

17:51.584 --> 17:55.174
And by little, I mean I will be back tomorrow
and I trust you'll be fine without me.

17:55.743 --> 17:57.601
And by that, I mean try not to fuck up.

17:57.724 --> 17:59.341
By fuck up, of course, I mean Mason.

17:59.685 --> 18:00.780
Your servant !

18:02.425 --> 18:04.932
Well... I have order to restore.

18:05.183 --> 18:06.403
Your servant !

18:06.525 --> 18:08.712
First time cute, second time
you have to buy me some beer.

18:10.218 --> 18:12.634
Rube, why do you assume I'm gonna fuck up ?

18:12.706 --> 18:13.612
'Cause you're a fuck up !

18:42.273 --> 18:44.472
This, of course, is the
perfect children's room.

18:50.929 --> 18:54.902
Plenty of space for more beds
if more kids are in God's plan.

18:55.210 --> 18:56.664
I don't see how God's involved.

19:01.315 --> 19:03.075
I'll be right back.

19:03.489 --> 19:04.488
Yes ?

19:05.563 --> 19:08.931
The only mold in that
house is between her ears.

19:11.262 --> 19:12.592
Grimm's anthology.

19:15.179 --> 19:16.536
I used to be a teacher, you know.

19:17.171 --> 19:18.511
I was supposed to put that away.

19:18.630 --> 19:19.618
That's okay.

19:19.730 --> 19:20.969
Such a lightful room.

19:21.805 --> 19:23.186
Where's your sister's bedroom ?

19:24.517 --> 19:27.042
My mom turned it into an exercise room.

19:27.446 --> 19:29.367
Oh... Where's your sister living now ?

19:30.360 --> 19:32.030
I don't know exactly.

19:32.343 --> 19:33.309
Is she in college ?

19:34.247 --> 19:35.302
She's dead.

19:37.196 --> 19:39.167
Oh I'm so sorry.

19:39.577 --> 19:42.465
It's okay, she's not like completely gone.

19:42.972 --> 19:45.695
- Because ?
- She comes back.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.603
- She comes back ?
- A lot.

19:55.874 --> 19:57.002
That wasn't her.

20:03.766 --> 20:04.736
Okay, everybody...

20:04.820 --> 20:07.463
If you could be an animal, any animal,

20:08.281 --> 20:09.766
what animal would you choose to be ?

20:11.200 --> 20:13.411
Dolores ! Would you like to go first ?

20:13.545 --> 20:15.388
I'd like to go last if you wouldn't mind.

20:15.490 --> 20:16.699
Okay, I think that'd be appropriate.

20:17.103 --> 20:18.132
Thanks, Greg.

20:18.312 --> 20:19.371
Millie, how about you ?

20:21.159 --> 20:24.001
I think I'll go right before Dolores.

20:24.964 --> 20:26.883
Do you think that's appropriate ?

20:27.216 --> 20:28.179
Who gives a shit ?

20:28.307 --> 20:29.598
I really do, Greg.

20:30.943 --> 20:31.932
Can I start ?

20:33.463 --> 20:35.348
Sure, Todd. Yeah, that'd be great.

20:36.617 --> 20:37.835
If I were an animal,

20:38.297 --> 20:39.991
I think I would be a crab.

20:40.764 --> 20:42.639
- Not an animal !
- Millie !

20:42.772 --> 20:44.380
It's not, it's a crustacean.

20:47.391 --> 20:49.351
What ? At least, I'm listening.

20:50.861 --> 20:52.593
I'm sorry. A crab is an animal.

20:52.680 --> 20:57.072
It's a big furry warm-blooded
beast that sleeps in cocktail sauce.

20:57.313 --> 21:01.896
Look, Millie. This is an exercise about
revealing yourself to your coworkers.

21:02.663 --> 21:05.269
And we all find things to
hide behind at the office.

21:05.388 --> 21:09.187
Our cubicles, our telephones, our deadlines,...

21:09.274 --> 21:10.564
Our sarcasm.

21:10.683 --> 21:14.737
You know, we all find ways not to get to
know the people that we rely on the most.

21:15.265 --> 21:17.788
Okay ? And out here in the wild,
there's no place to hide.

21:18.255 --> 21:23.013
Okay ? So I think that we should
all try to get to know Todd the crab.

21:24.882 --> 21:26.674
I bet Todd has crabs.

21:27.596 --> 21:28.522
Todd, please.

21:29.361 --> 21:33.350
I always feel as if I'm moving sideways.

21:34.062 --> 21:35.695
Motherfucking real fucked !

21:35.834 --> 21:36.950
Viciously fucked !

21:37.042 --> 21:38.477
Bullocking bastard hell !

21:38.763 --> 21:40.002
I'm officiously fucked.

21:40.073 --> 21:41.005
Why not you, darling ?

21:41.035 --> 21:43.037
Unless, of course, you're
interested in which case you could...

21:43.131 --> 21:44.144
No ? Well, piss off !

21:44.200 --> 21:45.771
Fuck off! Oh Jesus Christ !

21:46.014 --> 21:47.399
Oh bullocks !

21:47.492 --> 21:48.421
Kiffany ! Kiffany !

21:48.833 --> 21:50.021
Kiffany ! Kiffany !

21:51.246 --> 21:53.100
Listen. Have you found a little post-it ?

21:53.177 --> 21:55.132
You know, yellow, the writing on.

21:55.250 --> 21:57.021
Like the kind you people always play with ?

21:57.099 --> 21:58.281
- Yes, exactly !
- No.

21:58.553 --> 21:59.945
Is this one particularly important ?

22:00.201 --> 22:01.420
Bullock ! You don't know.

22:01.982 --> 22:03.447
Jesus Christ ! I'm fucked !

22:03.872 --> 22:04.856
Move !

22:05.215 --> 22:06.500
Shit ! Bullocks !

22:06.678 --> 22:07.733
Fucking bullocks !

22:08.235 --> 22:10.171
Okay, that's it. I'm fucking fucked.

22:10.241 --> 22:12.275
I'm bullockly viciously fucked.

22:12.494 --> 22:13.846
Royally fucked I am.

22:19.786 --> 22:21.164
Wow ! That is so interesting.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.817
I just assumed all those stories about

22:23.017 --> 22:25.137
degrading initiation rituals were true.

22:25.455 --> 22:27.615
No one has to kill anyone
to get in the Bold Eagles.

22:27.836 --> 22:29.979
We figured the right members
come up at the right time.

22:30.059 --> 22:33.066
Trish became one after someone had
read a poem he wrote in the biker mag.

22:33.498 --> 22:35.978
Open verse for the open road.

22:41.849 --> 22:43.565
I do love a real man of letters.

22:44.123 --> 22:45.818
So why are you guys called the Bold Eagles ?

22:46.064 --> 22:48.091
We don't wear helmets. Fucks with our hair.

22:49.009 --> 22:51.905
I just think a man should choose
how close to death he wants to live.

22:52.291 --> 22:53.590
Closer than you think, Tidy.

22:58.895 --> 23:01.251
Daisy ! Daisy ! I need your help now !

23:02.953 --> 23:04.169
You want to...

23:04.551 --> 23:06.366
You want to take your hands off the lady ?

23:11.686 --> 23:12.853
I'm in trouble !

23:13.309 --> 23:16.061
This is Mason. He's okay but he's
just not very well brought up is all.

23:16.160 --> 23:17.190
No, I'm not.

23:17.404 --> 23:19.448
The only thing we hate more than bad manners is

23:19.529 --> 23:20.989
a goddamned fascist helmet law.

23:21.486 --> 23:22.433
Bare heads 'till we're dead !

23:22.710 --> 23:23.632
'Till we're dead !

23:26.356 --> 23:27.604
Better dead than not !

23:33.807 --> 23:34.932
I lost my post-it.

23:35.721 --> 23:37.498
Have a nice ride, fellows. Gotta go !

23:40.743 --> 23:43.780
- Some loyal group of people.
- So dangerous.

23:49.543 --> 23:50.609
Tidy !

23:54.712 --> 23:56.739
Motorcycles, they're dangerous.

23:59.306 --> 24:00.989
Well, a helmet wouldn't have helped.

24:01.256 --> 24:02.433
Tidy made a big mess.

24:07.574 --> 24:10.892
And I moved here from Albany
when she broke off the engagement.

24:12.111 --> 24:15.777
3000 miles down the road and I
still can't get her out of my mind !

24:16.156 --> 24:19.873
No. We were never engaged ! Frank...

24:19.970 --> 24:20.890
We were totally engaged.

24:21.138 --> 24:22.961
- I gave you my mother's ring !
- So ?

24:23.524 --> 24:24.922
Okay, huh... Frank ! Frank ! Frank ! Frank !

24:25.148 --> 24:26.090
Sally...

24:26.416 --> 24:27.413
Please !

24:29.135 --> 24:30.050
Right, right.

24:31.949 --> 24:34.758
Anyways, that's why I feel like a leopard.

24:35.024 --> 24:36.627
Because you're stalking her ?

24:37.456 --> 24:39.468
Because I can't change my spots !

24:40.262 --> 24:42.714
Okay, Millie. I think it's your turn.

24:43.252 --> 24:44.266
I... No.

24:44.384 --> 24:45.797
I'm... I just...

24:45.909 --> 24:47.189
I... I don't really...

24:51.420 --> 24:53.369
I'm not an animal.

25:00.384 --> 25:02.341
This was starting to feel familiar.

25:02.556 --> 25:04.261
Staying on the side lines,

25:04.548 --> 25:08.490
criticizing, clinging to the fringes
instead of jumping into the fray.

25:09.299 --> 25:11.424
It was like watching the escalator run.

25:11.685 --> 25:12.929
When would I step on ?

25:13.446 --> 25:16.524
Okay, Dolores, well,
I guess that... just leaves you !

25:16.760 --> 25:17.710
Bring us home !

25:17.799 --> 25:20.847
- Well... I always thought...
- I'm a cat.

25:23.135 --> 25:25.648
I mean... not like a house cat,

25:26.049 --> 25:27.348
not like Marie, Dolores.

25:28.393 --> 25:29.386
I'm a stray.

25:31.844 --> 25:33.590
Wanders the streets alone.

25:34.676 --> 25:36.748
Kinda distant and mean.

25:40.814 --> 25:44.168
Not a cat you'd wanna pet
or bring home to your kids.

25:44.906 --> 25:47.461
You just don't know where
those claws are, you know.

25:52.089 --> 25:53.390
And I'm a black cat.

25:55.750 --> 26:00.421
And I have many, many lives.

26:04.911 --> 26:06.995
And now you know who I am.

26:12.493 --> 26:13.763
You think Rube would have a better lock.

26:21.492 --> 26:22.478
Wow !

26:24.424 --> 26:25.669
Color me impressed !

26:29.699 --> 26:32.161
He writes the information on our post-its.

26:32.238 --> 26:34.583
He has to copy it down from somewhere, right ?

26:34.752 --> 26:35.689
Yeah, but where ?

26:36.816 --> 26:39.667
I check the liquor cabinet,
you check everywhere else.

26:39.801 --> 26:41.657
Mason, no, this is a covert operation.

26:41.809 --> 26:44.506
We need to thread gently and cover our tracks.

26:48.280 --> 26:50.539
Old fossil head Rube !
Always have the best booze.

26:51.768 --> 26:54.788
They've been drinking long enough not
to mess around with the cheap shit.

26:55.285 --> 26:56.192
How is that helping ?

26:58.941 --> 27:01.015
Takes off the edge.
I'm on edges right now, alright ?

27:01.117 --> 27:03.233
Mason, if he finds out,
we've been rummaging around in here...

27:03.313 --> 27:04.234
Put that down !

27:04.947 --> 27:05.903
Put it down !

27:06.780 --> 27:08.429
Put that down !

27:11.178 --> 27:13.779
- Okay.
- This was your idea, Daisy.

27:22.417 --> 27:25.019
I once had to hide for
hours in one half this size

27:25.075 --> 27:29.233
from a shrew of Mrs. Tyron Powers who
was supposed to be in Palm Springs.

27:29.951 --> 27:32.811
I was forced to urinate in a eyeball glass.

27:33.550 --> 27:35.306
What is it with you and them married ones ?

27:36.000 --> 27:37.625
Forbidden food.

27:37.712 --> 27:40.001
That was then. And I don't know why
you're treating this like happy hour.

27:43.962 --> 27:44.875
Holy shit !

27:46.336 --> 27:48.818
So... So many of them !

27:49.326 --> 27:50.743
So much more of them !

27:53.796 --> 27:55.259
Poor me a drink, will you ?

27:56.156 --> 27:58.280
Just one and only to warm me up.

27:58.445 --> 27:59.387
Yeah, we'll loophole.

27:59.745 --> 28:01.108
Synapses up a bit.

28:01.204 --> 28:04.144
Make our minds a little more... nimble.

28:11.122 --> 28:12.392
We'll keep looking for your post-it.

28:12.480 --> 28:13.805
We'll keep looking ! Yeah !

28:38.407 --> 28:40.498
- Why are you spying on me ?
- I'm not.

28:41.040 --> 28:44.302
- I wasn't saying anything.
- I didn't say that you were.

28:44.481 --> 28:46.653
Why are you here then ?
Why just show up all of a sudden ?

28:47.349 --> 28:48.271
Well...

28:48.767 --> 28:51.250
What has been your experience as
to why I show up all of a sudden ?

28:52.526 --> 28:53.841
Oh no !

28:55.757 --> 28:59.520
You know, you do have actual
responsibilities in this world.

29:00.712 --> 29:03.816
I know you ! You're Millie's sponsor !

29:03.985 --> 29:05.372
So devoted !

29:06.894 --> 29:08.567
- It's Dolores, right ?
- Right !

29:08.757 --> 29:10.657
- And you're, Rube ?
- I am.

29:10.963 --> 29:13.708
Is that a first name or a last name ?

29:13.985 --> 29:14.958
Just Rube.

29:15.091 --> 29:16.008
Like Cher.

29:16.786 --> 29:17.692
Like Houdini.

29:18.255 --> 29:19.632
Love Houdini !

29:19.898 --> 29:21.783
Wouldn't it have been fun to have seen him ?

29:22.541 --> 29:26.927
Seen him ? Rube probably reaped him.

29:27.471 --> 29:29.944
What brings you out here, Rube ?

29:30.222 --> 29:31.399
Well, Dolores,

29:33.390 --> 29:35.219
as much as I'd like to get into that with you,

29:36.970 --> 29:38.716
one of the "A" of A.A. stands for...

29:38.844 --> 29:41.685
You don't... wanna drink, do you Millie ?

29:42.198 --> 29:43.929
Actually, I was referring to the other "A".

29:45.342 --> 29:46.779
Oh... Of course !

29:48.730 --> 29:51.874
Dolores, I think I need to go
for a walk and get some fresh air.

29:52.105 --> 29:54.030
You're on the woods,
you're surrounded by fresh air.

29:55.101 --> 29:57.539
I just... wanna go for a walk.

29:58.189 --> 30:04.456
I need to... commune with the spirits of...
the North West.

30:04.860 --> 30:06.379
You really are a cat, aren't you ?

30:06.836 --> 30:08.537
Alone and mysterious.

30:09.124 --> 30:11.666
Make sure you make it back
for ghost stories and Smores.

30:12.074 --> 30:13.084
I'll try.

30:15.823 --> 30:18.491
You don't happen to know
any ghost stories, do you ?

30:19.188 --> 30:20.963
I heard a couple in my days.

30:21.464 --> 30:23.862
And just as I was comfortable in the circle,

30:24.317 --> 30:25.951
death held me away.

30:27.609 --> 30:29.017
You put you left arm in,

30:29.118 --> 30:30.774
you put you left arm out,

30:30.840 --> 30:34.711
you put you left arm in
and you shake it all about !

30:34.779 --> 30:38.623
You do the hockey dockey
and you turn all around.

30:38.971 --> 30:41.639
That's what it's all about !

30:50.790 --> 30:51.906
I look like a flaffer.

30:52.218 --> 30:53.897
You should have seen me do the Charleston.

30:54.131 --> 30:55.782
You are lovely !

31:01.295 --> 31:04.855
Opera, opera, jazz...

31:05.100 --> 31:07.384
Boring, boring, snory !

31:08.214 --> 31:09.381
I am drunk.

31:10.482 --> 31:12.141
I hate being drunk !

31:12.673 --> 31:13.753
Funny I don't mind it.

31:14.896 --> 31:15.859
Ever.

31:18.783 --> 31:21.715
My goodness ! You think you know a man...

31:22.376 --> 31:23.815
Barry Manilow !

31:26.196 --> 31:27.240
Play me something swinging.

31:28.741 --> 31:30.148
I wanna dance and forget all this...

31:31.415 --> 31:32.323
this stuff.

31:32.760 --> 31:33.974
Oh yeah because you know what ?

31:35.709 --> 31:37.886
Somebody is gonna die
alone today, aren't they ?

31:41.101 --> 31:42.842
What was on your post-it, Mason ?

31:48.972 --> 31:51.829
Now, can I show you the outside storage ?

31:51.998 --> 31:53.125
I'd love to see that. Honey ?

31:53.667 --> 31:55.919
In a second. I just wanna get a
feel for the house one more time.

32:18.771 --> 32:20.748
So, Reggie. What were you watching ?

32:22.555 --> 32:23.501
Nothing.

32:25.536 --> 32:28.137
What did you mean when you
said your sister comes back ?

32:29.442 --> 32:30.810
She visits us.

32:31.009 --> 32:32.587
And you talk to her ?

32:33.277 --> 32:34.835
Not like face to face.

32:35.424 --> 32:38.214
So she checks up on you, sees if you're okay...

32:40.001 --> 32:40.942
I guess.

32:45.956 --> 32:46.868
Are you ?

32:53.649 --> 32:56.289
I don't think you should move here.

33:02.350 --> 33:03.790
Where was her favorite spot in the house ?

33:06.385 --> 33:07.778
Her room, I think.

33:09.454 --> 33:11.204
She didn't really tell me things.

33:14.431 --> 33:16.062
I think we should go back to the Waffle Haus.

33:16.130 --> 33:18.848
If you miss a reap, a wrath
will be visited upon you

33:18.849 --> 33:21.977
as such will have you writhing
in testicles shriveling horror.

33:22.069 --> 33:23.206
That was Rube.

33:23.277 --> 33:25.879
- Why do you drink so much ?
- You are so lovely. I love you.

33:26.002 --> 33:28.321
You're so perfect and
your skin is so beautiful.

33:28.459 --> 33:30.216
True but not what I asked.

33:30.358 --> 33:31.309
It's all the...

33:32.320 --> 33:34.773
the people's imperfections
that make them so beautiful.

33:36.371 --> 33:39.062
Like the black velvet that
shows off a little diamond.

33:39.964 --> 33:44.013
Those three freckles that
show off you alabaster skin.

33:44.286 --> 33:45.642
Cut the bullshit, Mason.

33:45.724 --> 33:46.657
What, Daisy ?

33:48.443 --> 33:49.426
Really.

33:49.427 --> 33:53.282
What in the whole goddamned scheme
of things is one more unhappy soul ?

33:54.798 --> 33:56.585
I just cannot get it any more.

33:59.605 --> 34:01.566
I cannot get it any more.

34:08.858 --> 34:10.630
You saw the post-it before you lost it.

34:11.043 --> 34:12.007
No.

34:14.532 --> 34:15.438
Yes, you did.

34:15.831 --> 34:18.304
You always look at it when you get it.

34:18.360 --> 34:19.308
Even for just a second.

34:19.503 --> 34:20.496
No, I don't.

34:21.444 --> 34:22.399
Do I ?

34:22.606 --> 34:23.588
I watch you.

34:25.668 --> 34:28.063
You never just put it in you pocket.

34:28.233 --> 34:29.389
You watch me ?

34:29.550 --> 34:31.716
You always look at it because you're curious.

34:32.049 --> 34:33.210
You wanna know.

34:34.813 --> 34:35.966
What do I wanna know ?

34:37.030 --> 34:38.295
Their name.

34:40.159 --> 34:42.703
Where they're gonna die. You're curious.

34:43.118 --> 34:44.501
- You always look at it.
- Yeah.

34:46.277 --> 34:49.196
Yeah. Sometimes I do look at it.

34:51.324 --> 34:52.960
And you looked at this one too.

34:54.762 --> 34:56.574
And this person won't die alone.

35:10.766 --> 35:12.222
This is a ghost story

35:13.307 --> 35:15.248
and it's a love story.

35:16.855 --> 35:20.270
It's about a man who loved a woman.

35:21.597 --> 35:26.241
A man who thought the flame of
their love could never diminish.

35:31.123 --> 35:32.119
But it did.

35:33.312 --> 35:34.869
What had once been a dance

35:35.546 --> 35:39.502
had become a battle.

35:41.060 --> 35:42.493
They fought, fought.

35:45.428 --> 35:46.707
In the dead of the night,

35:48.709 --> 35:53.169
after angry words were spoken,

35:55.703 --> 35:59.427
he left their bed and saddled his horse.

36:02.765 --> 36:03.912
She said to him:

36:05.136 --> 36:07.056
"If you don't come back in 3 days,

36:08.740 --> 36:10.271
then you can never come back.

36:10.804 --> 36:11.868
Mark my words.

36:14.416 --> 36:15.535
I'll be gone."

36:16.697 --> 36:17.737
Where would she go ?

36:18.089 --> 36:20.086
To live with an old
boyfriend from high school !

36:20.594 --> 36:22.872
I think you two are a
little ahead of the story.

36:24.792 --> 36:26.158
Am I gonna be interrupted again ?

36:28.674 --> 36:31.045
Any other questions, thoughts ?

36:34.173 --> 36:36.082
Then I will continue.

36:38.305 --> 36:39.435
Still angry.

36:41.739 --> 36:43.711
Still angry, the man rode away.

36:45.785 --> 36:47.348
And he enjoyed the solitude.

36:48.535 --> 36:51.018
The noise of their argument was replaced by the

36:52.176 --> 36:54.126
soothing sound of the forest.

37:05.494 --> 37:07.727
But after just 2 days in the forest,

37:11.264 --> 37:12.836
he was filled with regret.

37:16.072 --> 37:18.068
He wanted to return to the woman he loved.

37:19.247 --> 37:21.725
And he wanted to return to he life he missed.

37:23.092 --> 37:25.094
So he found a shortcut through the woods

37:25.339 --> 37:26.311
and he took it.

37:27.249 --> 37:31.151
He was desperate, desperate to get back to
the woman he loves before it was too late.

37:32.094 --> 37:33.947
Her threat surrounding his head...

37:34.301 --> 37:36.793
Would she wait for him or
would she be true to her words ?

37:37.214 --> 37:38.218
Would she be gone ?

37:42.017 --> 37:44.341
He could feel his horse losing speed

37:46.445 --> 37:48.458
as if it wouldn't make it through the night.

38:17.861 --> 38:18.971
What was that ?

38:19.140 --> 38:21.315
Double barrel, twelve gage, full choke.

38:21.382 --> 38:22.590
Do we need to go help somebody ?

38:23.578 --> 38:25.119
That was sweet, Frank.

38:29.185 --> 38:30.489
I'm just the storyteller.

38:30.740 --> 38:32.263
Greg here is in charge. Greg ?

38:32.375 --> 38:36.222
Oh oh ! No. No I... I don't think so.

38:36.370 --> 38:39.241
I'm a little afraid of the trees at night.

38:41.593 --> 38:45.002
We could either stop now or go on
with the story, it's up to you, guys.

38:45.104 --> 38:46.113
No more interruptions.

38:48.055 --> 38:49.011
Okay.

38:49.012 --> 38:49.993
How you doing, Crystal ?

38:50.046 --> 38:51.357
You're about to lose your marshmallow.

38:54.298 --> 38:57.091
The man came to the edge
of a dark and unknown swamp.

38:59.471 --> 39:00.608
He had to make a decision.

39:01.670 --> 39:03.200
Should he go into the swamp

39:03.835 --> 39:04.997
or go around ?

39:07.256 --> 39:09.473
Does he go through the
swamp or does he go around ?

39:10.440 --> 39:12.483
We all ask ourselves that question, don't we ?

39:15.500 --> 39:17.951
It's a very scary question to answer all alone.

39:22.779 --> 39:23.886
Excuse me, you...

39:24.731 --> 39:25.837
You got something I need.

39:25.978 --> 39:26.774
I'm sorry ?

39:26.775 --> 39:28.401
The post-it. It's mine.

39:28.611 --> 39:31.418
Then maybe you can tell me
why it has my name on it ?

39:32.392 --> 39:33.650
I can't do that, I'm sorry.

39:34.173 --> 39:35.172
I'm sorry.

39:39.283 --> 39:40.701
Next to the swamp was a boy.

39:43.820 --> 39:47.296
My name isn't... You ! oh God !

39:47.384 --> 39:48.429
The man asks the boy:

39:48.525 --> 39:49.452
"Tell me...

39:50.431 --> 39:52.084
does the swamp have an hard bottom ?"

39:53.983 --> 39:56.262
And the boy tells the man: "It does".

39:57.594 --> 40:01.357
So the man guides his horse into the swamp.

40:12.478 --> 40:17.967
And as he begins to sink,
deeper and deeper into the swamp,

40:18.581 --> 40:19.985
he says to the boy:

40:20.742 --> 40:22.985
"I thought you said it had a hard bottom !"

40:28.023 --> 40:31.161
And the boy says: "It does...

40:33.199 --> 40:34.638
You're just not there yet."

40:39.206 --> 40:41.673
So the man doesn't get
back to his wife in time.

40:41.843 --> 40:42.778
He might !

40:42.877 --> 40:45.089
He might get out and reach her ! Right ?

40:45.945 --> 40:47.495
That's the end of the story, folks.

40:48.740 --> 40:50.758
I mean he might get back to her.

40:51.305 --> 40:52.215
Guys !

40:54.275 --> 40:57.782
- Hey ! What did I miss ?
- A wonderful story.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.779
Millie, I've been worried about you.

40:59.846 --> 41:02.309
- We heard a gunshot.
- Oh I'm fine.

41:03.148 --> 41:05.883
Okay, just don't go off alone like that again.

41:07.408 --> 41:08.365
Rube !

41:08.904 --> 41:09.897
Thank you.

41:10.040 --> 41:10.980
Thank you.

41:16.803 --> 41:20.122
So was the story you told scary ?

41:21.161 --> 41:22.066
Oh I don't know.

41:22.094 --> 41:23.379
I didn't hear it, I just told it.

41:24.444 --> 41:25.795
Smart mouth !

41:26.122 --> 41:27.337
It was a little scary.

41:30.260 --> 41:32.268
You know why people like to get together to

41:33.005 --> 41:34.874
hear these kind of stories in the woods ?

41:35.856 --> 41:37.066
Why don't you tell me ?

41:39.436 --> 41:41.023
They like to face their fears...

41:42.759 --> 41:43.663
together.

41:45.626 --> 41:47.628
Somehow easier than facing them alone.

41:53.185 --> 41:54.101
You'd like some ?

41:55.073 --> 41:55.897
Of what ?

41:55.898 --> 41:56.910
It's what I've christened,

41:56.911 --> 42:00.271
the combination of Graham cracker and
chocolate lightly toasted over an open flame.

42:01.643 --> 42:02.743
We're out of marshmallows.

42:03.257 --> 42:04.225
Some ?

42:05.745 --> 42:06.979
That's better than nothing.

42:08.770 --> 42:09.738
I'll see you tomorrow.

42:13.420 --> 42:14.352
You're not staying ?

42:15.145 --> 42:16.881
I got an early breakfast meeting.

42:17.951 --> 42:19.442
You enjoy the rest of the retreat.

42:23.255 --> 42:26.006
Maybe it was just the warmth of the fire,

42:26.375 --> 42:29.523
but for once I was happy to
have a spot in the circle.

42:38.719 --> 42:42.513
Dolores and I drove back together and
she told me that she too was a cat,

42:42.958 --> 42:44.736
that she was born in the year of the cat,

42:45.111 --> 42:47.009
that she had all the qualities of a cat.

42:47.900 --> 42:50.322
I swear to God if she told
me she went in a litter box,

42:50.424 --> 42:52.437
I was living her by the side of the road.

43:02.319 --> 43:03.711
Looks good. More buyers coming ?

43:04.014 --> 43:05.535
No, this is for us.

43:05.943 --> 43:08.212
I thought we deserved a
little sit-down breakfast.

43:09.502 --> 43:10.675
Sorry, I gotta go.

43:10.859 --> 43:13.732
Wait ! Here take bacon !

43:17.387 --> 43:18.297
Reggie...

43:18.673 --> 43:21.428
You know, if you ever wanna
talk to me about anything,

43:21.929 --> 43:23.967
you know, I mean anything at all,

43:24.172 --> 43:25.647
about George.

43:27.434 --> 43:28.361
God !

43:31.880 --> 43:32.984
Hello ?

43:34.403 --> 43:35.324
Hello ?

43:36.911 --> 43:37.956
Come on !

43:38.083 --> 43:40.300
If anyone is there, would
you just say something ?

43:44.432 --> 43:46.692
You know if that keeps happening,
I'm gonna change our number.

43:47.828 --> 43:49.324
I don't think that's a good idea.

43:49.764 --> 43:50.754
I gotta go.

44:32.905 --> 44:35.509
Once upon a time, there was a girl named George

44:37.445 --> 44:40.881
who couldn't quite forget
there was once upon a time.

45:01.305 --> 45:07.738
