00:38.502 --> 00:40.004
Aaah!

00:44.275 --> 00:45.344
Here's the safe.

00:50.314 --> 00:53.581
Open the safe, amigo, or else.

00:53.583 --> 00:56.551
<i>Lo siento.</i> I don't
even know the combination.

00:56.553 --> 00:57.621
Give the signal.

01:03.327 --> 01:06.262
Starboard to signal.

01:06.264 --> 01:08.133
Fire!

01:17.074 --> 01:19.311
How do you like my opener?

01:25.583 --> 01:27.319
Huh?

01:30.088 --> 01:32.754
Who the heck are you? Hello and good-bye.

01:32.756 --> 01:36.091
They call me El Rollan.

01:36.093 --> 01:38.093
I'm a legend in these parts.

01:38.095 --> 01:40.196
I'll teach you to rob innocent people.

01:40.198 --> 01:42.631
We know how to do that already.

01:47.605 --> 01:49.771
You would look much more fearsome

01:49.773 --> 01:52.740
if you had a gun or a sword in your hand.

01:52.742 --> 01:55.413
Surrender immediately, or
I'll smite you with my...

01:58.648 --> 02:01.686
Eh... uh... with this.

02:03.320 --> 02:06.254
He's gonna smite us with his fish.

02:06.256 --> 02:10.261
- Look at Rollan the legend.
- Rollan the loser.

02:14.331 --> 02:17.532
Okay, I'll smite you with my tuna.

02:17.534 --> 02:19.303
<i>¡Ándale!</i>

02:25.443 --> 02:26.744
<i>¡Olé!</i>

02:31.748 --> 02:33.284
Huh?

02:35.719 --> 02:36.821
Nice dancing.

02:43.760 --> 02:46.595
You remind me of myself when I was young.

02:46.597 --> 02:49.899
I also dreamed of being a legend.

02:49.901 --> 02:54.436
So someone gave me this book
and said, "Read it and go."

02:54.438 --> 02:58.174
Here. I pass it on to you now.

02:58.176 --> 03:02.881
If you want to become a
legend someday, read it and go.

03:13.690 --> 03:14.793
Huh?

03:53.630 --> 03:55.200
Hmm.

04:04.609 --> 04:07.809
Looks to me like the
girls are crazy about you.

04:07.811 --> 04:10.314
No, they're just plain crazy.
I have nothing to do with it.

04:12.483 --> 04:15.350
- I love you, Dad.
- Look!

04:15.352 --> 04:19.853
Why do they envy us? We're orphans who
are forced to travel around like gypsies.

04:19.856 --> 04:23.859
To them, we're legends. We defeated
the Snow Queen and saved the world.

04:23.861 --> 04:25.794
Legends? Really?

04:25.796 --> 04:29.597
Somehow I feel more like a circus
sideshow act, like a singing donkey.

04:29.599 --> 04:32.001
The students are just arriving now.

04:32.003 --> 04:35.503
We'll bring you out in about five minutes.

04:35.505 --> 04:39.508
At least with these kids, there's
someone out there who needs us.

04:39.510 --> 04:42.044
No one will ever replace
our parents, Gerda.

04:42.046 --> 04:44.946
Here. I wanted to give you this.

04:44.948 --> 04:48.383
- It's a drawing I made for you.
- Wow. Kai.

04:48.385 --> 04:50.986
You drew this?

04:50.988 --> 04:53.888
Thank you. It's beautiful.

04:53.890 --> 04:55.691
It's amazing.

04:55.693 --> 04:59.294
But you were so little
the last time you saw them.

04:59.296 --> 05:01.630
How did you remember what they looked like?

05:01.632 --> 05:03.965
Sometimes I see them in my dreams.

05:03.967 --> 05:07.936
Oh, Kai, thank you.

05:07.938 --> 05:11.472
We have very special
guests here today, children.

05:11.474 --> 05:15.510
Here they are, the famous
defeaters of the Snow Queen,

05:15.512 --> 05:18.946
the sibling legends, Gerda and Kai.

05:26.089 --> 05:29.090
And that's how we defeated the Snow Queen.

05:31.962 --> 05:34.595
Our parents would be proud of us now.

05:34.597 --> 05:38.900
Kids, you have five minutes to
talk with our honored guests.

05:38.902 --> 05:41.272
Whoo-hoo!

05:45.409 --> 05:47.910
I'm afraid you're squeezing
in a little too tight.

05:47.912 --> 05:50.912
Please, give us some space.

06:03.460 --> 06:06.664
I want an autograph too!

06:07.397 --> 06:08.696
So adorable.

06:16.674 --> 06:18.907
Go, go, go!

06:18.909 --> 06:20.642
I got a lock of his hair!

06:23.046 --> 06:24.815
Wait! Stop!

06:27.818 --> 06:29.551
You forgot your payment.

06:29.553 --> 06:31.453
Here you are.

06:31.455 --> 06:33.791
You gave such a great performance.

06:37.827 --> 06:40.162
Looks like we'll go without dinner tonight.

06:46.537 --> 06:50.037
Remember, they can't destroy our memories.

06:50.039 --> 06:52.109
And this. Let me fix it.

06:53.443 --> 06:55.176
Tough luck.

06:55.178 --> 06:57.513
Okay, what's next?

06:57.515 --> 07:00.181
Tomorrow we're speaking at another
grade school in the countryside,

07:00.183 --> 07:01.784
and after that...

07:01.786 --> 07:03.719
Let me see that.

07:03.721 --> 07:07.655
- Kai!
- Scrambling around from town to town for peanuts.

07:07.657 --> 07:11.160
This wouldn't be happening to us if our
parents were around, you can be sure of that.

07:11.162 --> 07:14.662
But we don't have parents anymore.

07:14.664 --> 07:17.198
What else would we do? Where would we go?

07:17.200 --> 07:19.167
I've already thought everything through.

07:19.169 --> 07:21.169
We'll stay with Orm for a while.

07:21.171 --> 07:23.438
He'll be happy to have us over,

07:23.440 --> 07:26.073
and the other trolls don't
really care who we are.

07:26.075 --> 07:30.878
No one will ever play nasty tricks
on us or tear us apart for souvenirs.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.748
- Stay with Orm?
- Yeah.

07:32.750 --> 07:36.184
We'll stay with him and
then decide what to do next.

07:36.186 --> 07:38.520
I guess it could work.

07:38.522 --> 07:42.157
But if you didn't like the way we
lived, why didn't you say so before?

07:42.159 --> 07:44.760
I tried. You just didn't listen.

07:44.762 --> 07:46.527
Oh, Kai, I...

07:49.866 --> 07:51.770
Hey!

07:53.070 --> 07:55.136
Looks like we're walking to Orm's.

07:55.138 --> 07:56.607
Hmm. Hmph.

08:01.678 --> 08:04.812
Cheer up. Just think of the
cool life we'll have there.

08:04.814 --> 08:06.648
And a cool place to stay.

08:06.650 --> 08:09.585
And no more Snow Queen stories.

08:09.587 --> 08:11.220
Promise me?

08:11.222 --> 08:12.955
I promise.

08:12.957 --> 08:16.591
No one will know who we really
are, so let's keep it that way.

08:16.593 --> 08:19.127
I think we even need to change our names.

08:19.129 --> 08:21.128
Change our names? Why?

08:21.130 --> 08:23.865
We need simple and unassuming names.

08:23.867 --> 08:26.167
How about Hansel and Gretel?

08:26.169 --> 08:29.003
We're regular kids, not some legends.

08:29.005 --> 08:32.073
Or even better, how about pirate names?

08:32.076 --> 08:34.542
You can be Cutthroat Carl and I'll be...

08:34.544 --> 08:35.878
Pirates.

08:35.880 --> 08:39.013
Kai, what on earth are you doing?

08:39.015 --> 08:41.649
Sometimes Alfida goes
out skiing in this area.

08:41.650 --> 08:44.119
She knows my signal. With
any luck she'll see us.

08:44.121 --> 08:45.823
Alfida, the pirate girl?

08:59.135 --> 09:00.771
Kai!

09:05.875 --> 09:08.810
So <i>this</i> is what you meant by skiing?

09:08.812 --> 09:10.278
Amazing.

09:10.280 --> 09:14.016
Looks like you lubbers could
use a lift. Climb aboard.

09:14.018 --> 09:17.585
What are you doing here? Did you
finally decide to become pirates?

09:17.587 --> 09:19.555
No way.

09:19.557 --> 09:21.623
Will you take us to Orm's?

09:21.625 --> 09:24.261
Sure. I'm all free now. I'm on my holiday.

09:41.245 --> 09:44.211
Huh?

09:44.213 --> 09:46.717
I'll get you!

09:56.961 --> 10:00.095
Huh?

10:11.775 --> 10:14.176
Yay!

10:22.019 --> 10:24.085
- Orm doesn't feel bored here.
- Luta!

10:24.087 --> 10:26.354
Hi, Orm!

10:26.356 --> 10:29.758
Kai! Gerda! Alfida! My old friends.

10:31.327 --> 10:32.664
Oh!

10:36.000 --> 10:38.233
Load the cannons and fire!

10:47.244 --> 10:50.378
Nice place you've got here.

10:50.380 --> 10:54.749
By thunder, this is a right awesome cabin.

10:54.751 --> 10:57.284
Yeah, well, Grandma became a queen,

10:57.286 --> 11:00.154
and now I have some relatives
I didn't know about before.

11:00.156 --> 11:03.057
I'm off to the mountainside. I want to
paint the landscape in the moonlight.

11:03.059 --> 11:05.359
<i>Buenas tardes.</i>

11:05.361 --> 11:08.696
Hey, didn't anyone
teach you to knock first?

11:08.698 --> 11:11.800
Sorry, Orm, but you've promised
to tell one more legend.

11:15.673 --> 11:17.038
Sure. Come on in.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.242
Meet Gerda, Alfida, and Kai.

11:20.144 --> 11:21.877
Hmm!

11:21.879 --> 11:23.378
Guys, this is Rollan.

11:23.380 --> 11:25.080
<i>Hola, amigos.</i>

11:25.082 --> 11:26.750
Hi.

11:31.255 --> 11:32.890
So you're from Spain?

11:33.991 --> 11:36.023
How did you end up here?

11:36.025 --> 11:40.995
This pirate lady gave me a book that
opened my eyes and changed my life.

11:40.997 --> 11:45.466
I'm fascinated by legends, so I
came here to the land of the legends.

11:45.468 --> 11:48.136
Everyone knows that
trolls are famous for them.

11:48.138 --> 11:50.238
Pirate lady? Oh!

11:50.240 --> 11:51.873
That was my mom.

11:51.875 --> 11:56.143
She told me all about
you, the legend fanatic.

11:58.848 --> 12:02.017
The pirates still laugh about it.

12:02.019 --> 12:06.721
I believe the old saying...
where there's smoke, there's fire.

12:06.723 --> 12:09.957
Legends do exist. They're all around us.

12:09.959 --> 12:12.494
Gerda and Kai are such beautiful names.

12:12.496 --> 12:14.830
Straight from the legend Orm once told me.

12:14.832 --> 12:18.499
Actually, our names are very
common where we come from.

12:18.501 --> 12:20.435
Orm told you?

12:20.437 --> 12:22.738
How interesting.

12:22.740 --> 12:24.306
What legend is that? Tell us.

12:24.308 --> 12:25.873
Fine, then.

12:25.875 --> 12:28.844
Listen to my personal
favorite, which is about Gerda,

12:28.846 --> 12:30.811
who saved all the trolls
from the Snow Queen.

12:30.813 --> 12:32.848
Luta!

12:32.850 --> 12:36.383
Remember a couple of years ago we had
a very long winter and nobody knew why?

12:36.385 --> 12:38.920
Someone blamed a global cold snap.

12:38.922 --> 12:42.056
Someone else a conspiracy
of sled and ski sellers.

12:42.058 --> 12:45.093
But indeed that was the doing
of the mighty Snow Queen.

12:45.095 --> 12:47.061
No way! Really?

12:47.063 --> 12:48.529
<i>Sí, mi amigo.</i>

12:48.531 --> 12:50.798
And we would all have been frozen

12:50.800 --> 12:54.835
if it were not for the
two heroes, Gerda and Kai.

12:54.837 --> 12:57.474
- Wow.
- So here's how the story goes.

12:59.308 --> 13:01.877
Then Gerda leaped to the
Snow Queen and yelled,

13:01.879 --> 13:04.079
"Abracadabra!"

13:04.081 --> 13:06.547
Then Gerda grabs the
Snow Queen by the collar,

13:06.549 --> 13:08.215
really lets her have it.

13:08.217 --> 13:10.284
- Ha!
- Uh... uh...

13:10.286 --> 13:14.355
And the Snow Queen is like, "Oh,
little Gerda, please don't kill me."

13:14.357 --> 13:18.026
And Gerda says, "You kidnapped
my brother. You froze my parents.

13:18.028 --> 13:19.326
I'll destroy you."

13:19.328 --> 13:22.062
And she beat her with
magic, magic, more magic.

13:22.064 --> 13:23.831
Huh?

13:30.874 --> 13:33.474
Abracadabra! Scorky yorky!

13:33.476 --> 13:36.545
Then Gerda throws the Snow
Queen right up into the sky.

13:36.547 --> 13:39.984
Now there she is, the North Star.

13:41.851 --> 13:44.319
Wow. That's amazing.

13:44.321 --> 13:47.022
What was there before the North Star?

13:47.024 --> 13:48.893
Um...

13:49.992 --> 13:52.827
I-I-I'll go get
some firewood.

13:52.829 --> 13:54.830
- It's getting pretty chilly in here.
- Orm!

13:54.832 --> 13:57.599
- What?
- Were you trolling him?

13:57.601 --> 14:00.601
Why are you blaming me?

14:00.603 --> 14:03.939
Trolls all over our kingdom compete
to come up with the funniest legend

14:03.941 --> 14:06.106
to tell the new guy in town.

14:06.108 --> 14:07.542
I'm sorry, Rollan.

14:07.544 --> 14:10.946
What a fool I was.

14:10.948 --> 14:14.516
Wait. How do you know this
legend isn't really true?

14:14.518 --> 14:18.485
Are you the very same
legends from the story?

14:18.487 --> 14:22.923
Are you the unbelievable mix of
awesomeness and power that they call Kai?

14:22.925 --> 14:24.859
And are you Gerda,

14:24.861 --> 14:27.896
the most beautiful and heroic
girl in the entire world?

14:27.898 --> 14:29.397
- Yes.
- No!

14:29.399 --> 14:31.633
- Yes!
- No! You promised.

14:31.635 --> 14:34.335
Yes, I promised. But lying isn't right.

14:34.337 --> 14:36.071
Are you calling me a liar?

14:36.073 --> 14:39.106
Both you and I decided to
keep it a secret. Remember?

14:39.108 --> 14:42.610
He asked a simple question, so
I gave him a truthful answer.

14:42.612 --> 14:44.879
I've had it with people like him.

14:44.881 --> 14:47.315
Now they're coming all the
way from Spain to laugh at us,

14:47.317 --> 14:49.183
to see the curiosities.

14:49.185 --> 14:51.887
Everybody thinks that we're legends,
that we live this charmed life,

14:51.889 --> 14:53.321
but we don't!

14:53.323 --> 14:55.489
We move around from town
to town like vagabonds,

14:55.491 --> 14:57.057
all for chump change.

14:57.059 --> 14:58.526
But no more!

14:58.528 --> 15:01.662
That "chump change" was
all we had to live on.

15:01.664 --> 15:04.498
I can't hide any longer
or tell people lies.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.566
Stop bickering, you two.

15:05.568 --> 15:07.101
You're just a selfish narcissist.

15:07.103 --> 15:09.170
And you're just ungrateful.

15:09.172 --> 15:11.172
All right, then go.

15:11.174 --> 15:14.209
Tell everyone about your
heroic feats. But without me.

15:14.211 --> 15:16.945
Good. Maybe I will.

15:16.947 --> 15:21.048
But who will look after you? Let's face
it. You're pretty helpless without me.

15:21.050 --> 15:23.417
I don't need anyone to look after me.

15:23.419 --> 15:25.287
- I don't need a sister!
- Oh!

15:25.289 --> 15:28.489
If our parents were here, you would behave.

15:28.491 --> 15:30.093
But they aren't!

15:38.935 --> 15:40.368
Wait. What are you doing?

15:40.370 --> 15:43.037
I'm buzzing off, away from here.

15:43.039 --> 15:45.075
- It's my ship.
- Then help me.

16:08.365 --> 16:11.132
I just don't understand how
Kai can behave like that.

16:11.134 --> 16:13.000
You saved his life.

16:13.002 --> 16:16.571
If somebody saved my life, I'd
be serving them peeled grapes.

16:16.573 --> 16:19.373
I don't think Kai understands
how difficult it was for me

16:19.375 --> 16:22.576
to make ends meet without
our parents around.

16:22.578 --> 16:25.245
She didn't care about my opinion.

16:25.247 --> 16:27.548
Your sister loves you.

16:27.550 --> 16:29.584
She traveled halfway around the world

16:29.586 --> 16:32.454
and defeated the Snow
Queen in order to save you.

16:32.456 --> 16:34.222
That was a long time ago.

16:34.224 --> 16:36.491
She changed a lot since then.

16:36.493 --> 16:39.727
Now I think I'm just a burden for her.

16:39.729 --> 16:43.365
I tried to provide a better
living for the both of us,

16:43.367 --> 16:47.605
but without our parents
I'm afraid I failed.

16:49.139 --> 16:52.407
Kai was everything that I had.

16:52.409 --> 16:56.110
From now on I can fend for myself.

16:56.112 --> 16:57.611
I'm leaving.

16:57.613 --> 17:00.215
Have you thought that through carefully?

17:00.217 --> 17:04.151
Yes, I think that it'll be
better for the both of us.

17:04.153 --> 17:07.387
I understand your pain about your parents.

17:07.390 --> 17:09.522
You know, I study legends

17:09.525 --> 17:12.560
because I've been searching
for my lost mother too.

17:12.561 --> 17:14.560
- Really?
- Yes.

17:14.563 --> 17:17.598
It's still my dearest
wish to someday find her,

17:17.601 --> 17:19.532
and I think I can now.

17:19.535 --> 17:22.603
I know how to do it, because
there is this troll legend...

17:22.605 --> 17:26.174
Wait. Did Orm tell you that one too?

17:26.175 --> 17:28.309
No. Look at this.

17:28.310 --> 17:30.411
It's called the wishing stone.

17:30.413 --> 17:34.749
If a person finds it and makes their
dearest wish upon it, it will come true.

17:34.751 --> 17:37.619
I've been searching for it for a long time.

17:37.621 --> 17:40.254
The trolls couldn't help me
because they don't know where it is.

17:40.256 --> 17:44.125
Omana's Caves, Lake Gao, the Temple.

17:44.127 --> 17:47.262
The trolls all know about
these places as well.

17:47.264 --> 17:49.664
It's just forbidden to go there.

17:49.666 --> 17:52.132
- Forbidden?
- Of course it is.

17:52.134 --> 17:54.668
You can get cursed, or cast spells there,

17:54.670 --> 17:58.740
or cause trouble to the whole
city or even the entire world.

17:58.742 --> 18:00.274
- Let's go.
- Where?

18:00.276 --> 18:02.176
Let's find the wishing stone.

18:02.178 --> 18:04.478
You're not the only one
who has a wish to make.

18:04.480 --> 18:07.448
- But what about all the taboos and curses?
- Chicken?

18:07.450 --> 18:09.652
I'd do anything for my mother.

18:19.763 --> 18:23.398
It was the most amazing
thing I'd ever seen.

18:37.214 --> 18:38.612
That's how it was.

18:38.614 --> 18:41.249
This mirror helped me
to defeat the Snow Queen.

18:41.251 --> 18:43.618
Hmm. Hmm.

18:53.796 --> 18:55.295
That's it.

18:55.297 --> 18:57.300
We're not tourists anymore.
We're professionals.

19:27.898 --> 19:30.631
Do you know how to ice skate?

19:30.633 --> 19:31.866
No.

19:31.868 --> 19:33.834
Don't worry. I'll teach you.

19:33.836 --> 19:36.436
Aah!

20:31.594 --> 20:33.360
Ahh.

20:33.362 --> 20:34.664
Hmm? Huh?

20:53.717 --> 20:55.015
Huh?

20:55.017 --> 20:57.417
Two stones.

20:57.419 --> 21:00.988
There is only one in the
legend, and we have two.

21:00.990 --> 21:04.725
It looks too ominous to be
the wishing stone, doesn't it?

21:08.031 --> 21:11.632
What are you talking about?
It's here to scare the tourists.

21:11.634 --> 21:13.736
But we are professionals.

21:18.374 --> 21:19.576
It's stuck.

21:44.301 --> 21:46.533
Maybe it's a trap.

21:46.535 --> 21:48.339
I don't see anything.

21:49.371 --> 21:50.740
I'll check it out.

21:55.044 --> 21:56.511
- What the...
- Rollan!

21:56.513 --> 21:59.513
- Gerda!
- What's going on here?

21:59.515 --> 22:01.515
Uh... Uh...

22:01.517 --> 22:03.886
Rollan. Rollan!

22:07.524 --> 22:09.956
- Huh?
- Rollan, are you okay?

22:09.958 --> 22:12.627
I'm fine. Don't worry
about me. How are you?

22:12.629 --> 22:14.361
I'm fine too.

22:14.363 --> 22:16.930
I-I don't know. What's going on here?

22:16.932 --> 22:19.734
Do you see anything there at all?

22:19.736 --> 22:21.639
Yes! I found something!

22:33.015 --> 22:34.784
Huh?

22:37.786 --> 22:39.387
What is it?

22:39.389 --> 22:42.357
Uh... don't know yet.

22:57.373 --> 22:59.407
What's going on, Gerda?

22:59.409 --> 23:01.312
Huh?

23:07.950 --> 23:09.452
Uh...

23:14.690 --> 23:15.825
Maybe this!

23:23.099 --> 23:25.535
Rollan, I've gotta get
you out of there! Hold on!

23:28.071 --> 23:30.571
Huh?

23:30.573 --> 23:31.906
Huh?

23:48.925 --> 23:50.561
Gerda!

23:59.936 --> 24:02.703
Ooh! Aah! Ohh!

24:02.705 --> 24:04.608
Ah!

24:06.442 --> 24:09.579
Huh?

24:14.516 --> 24:17.952
Whew!

24:17.954 --> 24:19.486
Uh-oh.

24:19.488 --> 24:21.891
Huh?

24:27.464 --> 24:29.196
Rollan, are you okay?

24:29.198 --> 24:32.032
Thank you for saving me.

24:32.034 --> 24:33.868
Uh, you're welcome.

24:41.844 --> 24:44.212
Oh, wow.

24:44.214 --> 24:45.883
<i>Magnifico.</i>

24:47.950 --> 24:52.786
It's so beautiful. Have you
ever heard of this place?

24:52.788 --> 24:55.523
- No.
- Me neither.

24:55.525 --> 24:58.161
It means no one ever
made it out of here alive.

25:32.094 --> 25:34.529
Gerda, look!

25:34.531 --> 25:36.531
The wishing stone!

25:36.533 --> 25:39.969
I can't believe it. We did it. We found it.

25:54.150 --> 25:56.751
Dear wishing stone,

25:56.753 --> 25:59.056
please make my parents come back.

26:00.255 --> 26:03.259
<i>Glacium versus ignus.</i>

26:15.271 --> 26:16.874
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

26:23.780 --> 26:27.281
You shall be hot like fire.
You shall be cold like ice.

26:27.283 --> 26:31.586
The evil force inside you
will like a slave reside.

26:31.588 --> 26:34.988
But the moment a star appears in the view,

26:34.990 --> 26:38.794
the evil force will
make a slave out of you!

26:40.596 --> 26:41.931
The Snow Queen!

26:51.073 --> 26:54.007
Soon as the first star appears in the view,

26:54.009 --> 26:58.244
my reign over the Earth will start anew.

27:17.265 --> 27:21.369
Yeah. Oh, yeah, man.

27:21.371 --> 27:26.307
<i>♪ Sitting out On this
cold, cold night ♪</i>

27:27.611 --> 27:31.681
<i>♪ Watching the dudes
Fishing by the moonlight ♪</i>

27:33.949 --> 27:37.818
<i>♪ With my horse, of
course It feels so right ♪</i>

27:45.428 --> 27:48.061
Guess he just doesn't like reggae.

27:48.063 --> 27:50.296
Hee-haw!

27:50.298 --> 27:53.333
Run!

27:53.335 --> 27:56.707
I guess no dudes here like reggae.

28:24.700 --> 28:26.135
Huh?

29:12.348 --> 29:14.148
Whew.

29:16.518 --> 29:18.688
Oh! Ohh!

29:21.757 --> 29:23.090
Rollan.

29:23.092 --> 29:24.792
Rollan, are you okay?

29:24.794 --> 29:26.830
I'm not sure.

29:30.466 --> 29:32.169
Ohh!

29:37.473 --> 29:39.072
Oh!

29:39.074 --> 29:41.908
- Oh, my gosh.
- Awesome!

29:41.910 --> 29:44.145
Gerda, is it you?

29:44.147 --> 29:47.080
I was afraid. You look like the Snow Queen.

29:47.082 --> 29:49.015
- How did you do it?
- Uh...

29:49.017 --> 29:51.452
Huh? What?

29:51.454 --> 29:54.191
- Why are you looking at me like my head is on fire?
- Well...

29:59.461 --> 30:02.428
What's happened to us?
Is it not my reflection?

30:02.430 --> 30:05.099
The stone has something mixed up.

30:05.101 --> 30:08.135
I just asked the wishing stone
to make my parents come back.

30:08.137 --> 30:11.071
Those were your parents?
You should've warned me.

30:11.073 --> 30:12.973
Don't be stupid.

30:12.975 --> 30:15.208
It seems that the Snow Queen embodied me

30:15.210 --> 30:17.378
and some kind of fire demon got into you.

30:17.380 --> 30:19.379
In me? A demon?

30:19.381 --> 30:20.851
Oh, my gosh.

30:27.055 --> 30:29.793
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.

30:38.266 --> 30:39.433
Oh.

30:39.435 --> 30:42.072
Ohh!

30:47.442 --> 30:49.812
Yeah.

30:55.517 --> 30:57.283
Ah!

31:00.422 --> 31:02.025
Ohh!

31:20.409 --> 31:23.977
Uh, this looks nothing
like our wishes coming true.

31:23.979 --> 31:25.281
What now?

31:51.407 --> 31:52.943
Aaah!

32:01.583 --> 32:05.285
A long time ago Orm used to
be the Snow Queen's servant.

32:05.287 --> 32:08.187
He should know what happened
to us. He'll help us.

32:08.189 --> 32:10.323
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

32:10.325 --> 32:15.161
And if I find out that he told you
about this wishing stone, I'll...

32:15.163 --> 32:16.629
Got it.

32:16.631 --> 32:18.869
Uh...

32:44.526 --> 32:46.126
Huh?

32:46.128 --> 32:50.430
<i>Up, down, up, down, up, down.</i>

32:50.432 --> 32:52.465
<i>Very good. Now stretch.</i>

32:52.467 --> 32:56.337
<i>Back straight, chest out.</i>

32:56.339 --> 32:59.138
<i>Now let's work those glutes.</i>

32:59.140 --> 33:02.678
<i>And one, two, one, two, one, two.</i>

33:27.535 --> 33:29.636
Huh?

33:37.178 --> 33:39.747
What the...

33:42.517 --> 33:45.452
- Oh, this feels great.
- Uncle Orm!

33:45.454 --> 33:47.787
Hey there, buddy, come on in.

33:49.758 --> 33:52.161
Wow. What's that smell?

33:53.561 --> 33:55.629
I didn't do it.

33:55.631 --> 33:58.032
- Me neither.
- Then who?

33:58.034 --> 34:00.436
Huh?

34:30.697 --> 34:34.635
- Do you think we are still in the forbidden area?
- No idea. Keep quiet.

34:34.637 --> 34:38.338
Your Majesty, the
celebration must be canceled.

34:38.340 --> 34:40.739
And we have to think of
how to save our lives.

34:40.742 --> 34:43.141
There is no escaping your destiny.

34:43.143 --> 34:44.678
We can't spread panic.

34:44.679 --> 34:48.815
But somebody dared to awaken
the ancient curse of Lake Gao.

34:48.818 --> 34:51.350
The whole world is in danger.

34:51.351 --> 34:54.554
Long ago my grandfather
died on the battlefield

34:54.556 --> 34:57.291
trying to fight the lake's curse.

34:57.293 --> 34:59.425
Trolls then hardly survived,

34:59.427 --> 35:04.164
and now I'm given a chance
to fulfill his destiny.

35:04.166 --> 35:07.633
What fool dared to step
into these forbidden caves?

35:07.635 --> 35:12.238
We have to find him before
it's too late. But how?

35:12.240 --> 35:15.742
We'll understand who
it is once we see them.

35:15.744 --> 35:17.577
Do it then,

35:17.579 --> 35:21.183
and I'll go to my people
and try to calm them down.

35:27.622 --> 35:29.691
What have we done?

35:33.262 --> 35:37.231
Hurry up to Orm. We need to
get everything back to normal.

35:37.233 --> 35:40.800
What's more important, we
need to do that unnoticed.

35:40.802 --> 35:46.173
Something has to be done
about our appearances too.

35:46.175 --> 35:48.575
With your hair burning you won't go far.

35:48.577 --> 35:49.876
And you look amazing.

35:49.878 --> 35:52.211
No doubt. But what about you?

35:59.387 --> 36:01.623
Mm-mmm!

36:13.769 --> 36:15.671
Ah!

36:20.709 --> 36:23.480
Huh! Ha!

36:47.669 --> 36:49.836
Enjoy the show. Hey, look, what...

36:49.838 --> 36:52.305
Aah! Oh, that hurts!

36:52.307 --> 36:54.675
Quiet. It was just some water.

36:54.677 --> 36:57.544
Water? It was painful.

36:57.546 --> 36:59.912
Oh, please don't attract attention.

36:59.914 --> 37:02.552
They'll notice us
because of you in no time.

37:08.490 --> 37:09.659
Hmm?

37:10.959 --> 37:12.695
Mmm. Mm-mmm.

37:14.563 --> 37:17.300
Whew. Nobody noticed us.

37:22.371 --> 37:24.704
Gerda?

37:24.706 --> 37:26.539
Your Highness, there they are!

37:26.541 --> 37:28.677
It's them! They're the culprits!

37:29.912 --> 37:32.912
Ladies and gentlemen, trolls of all ages,

37:32.914 --> 37:35.849
welcome to our one-and-only
performance in your fair town.

37:35.851 --> 37:37.783
The Fire and Ice Show,

37:37.785 --> 37:40.820
featuring that legendary
master of fire, Rollan.

37:40.822 --> 37:43.990
Nonsense.

37:43.992 --> 37:48.461
That's Gerda, the one who
saved us from the Snow Queen.

37:48.463 --> 37:50.564
Gerda! Gerda! Gerda!

37:50.566 --> 37:53.466
Good thing I've always got a cool
head, huh? Now it's your turn.

37:53.468 --> 37:55.438
You distract them. I'll find the way out.

37:57.972 --> 37:59.905
Uh... Uh...

38:21.396 --> 38:24.330
What else can you expect
from this clumsy chump?

38:26.501 --> 38:27.736
Hey.

38:29.070 --> 38:30.472
Come on.

38:35.543 --> 38:37.044
Rollan the legend?

38:37.046 --> 38:40.613
Yeah, more like Rollan the loser.

39:13.014 --> 39:14.049
It's him!

39:29.597 --> 39:31.731
Huh?

39:40.476 --> 39:41.774
Capture them!

39:41.776 --> 39:43.843
Run!

39:43.845 --> 39:45.711
Hurry!

39:45.713 --> 39:49.483
Catch them! I must know what's going on.

39:49.485 --> 39:52.555
There's chaos and anarchy already starting.

39:57.492 --> 39:59.695
Huh?

40:14.108 --> 40:15.377
Come on.

40:23.418 --> 40:24.586
It's over. We're trapped.

40:34.896 --> 40:36.832
Hold on tight.

41:11.133 --> 41:13.033
- Uh... Uh...
- Huh?

41:13.035 --> 41:15.468
- Huh?
- Uh...

41:15.470 --> 41:17.173
Just don't ask how.

41:22.945 --> 41:25.979
With the help of that caravan,
we'll get out of the city.

41:25.981 --> 41:28.981
Watch and learn how to hitch a ride.

41:28.983 --> 41:30.584
Hey, mister, will you give us a lift?

41:30.586 --> 41:33.253
Hi, Gerda. How's life?

41:33.255 --> 41:37.189
It could be better. We need to get
to Orm's as quickly as possible.

41:37.191 --> 41:40.227
Come on in. We're also leaving.

41:40.229 --> 41:42.896
No one here likes reggae.

41:45.233 --> 41:49.035
I can't believe it was
Gerda. She saved our lives.

41:49.037 --> 41:51.271
Maybe she regrets doing that.

41:51.273 --> 41:54.908
Are you sure you didn't offend her somehow?

41:54.910 --> 41:56.943
Is that a joke?

41:56.945 --> 41:58.812
You're a shaman, not a clown.

41:58.814 --> 42:00.680
What do we do now?

42:00.682 --> 42:02.883
I don't know.

42:02.885 --> 42:04.550
You <i>should</i> know.

42:04.552 --> 42:07.287
If you don't know, what good are you?

42:07.289 --> 42:11.624
There is one trustworthy way though.

42:11.626 --> 42:14.260
Find out what happened
and report back to me.

42:14.262 --> 42:16.530
You have a few hours until evening.

42:16.532 --> 42:19.568
Otherwise, you'll be a clown
for the rest of your life.

42:23.204 --> 42:25.738
Huh?

42:33.115 --> 42:35.916
Oh! Oh!

42:35.918 --> 42:38.285
Huh?

42:38.287 --> 42:40.022
Oh! Oh!

42:49.865 --> 42:51.868
Huh?

42:57.271 --> 42:59.305
- Huh?
- A giant!

43:34.175 --> 43:36.809
Whoo!

43:36.811 --> 43:39.379
Yee-hah!

43:39.381 --> 43:41.651
Whoo-hah!

43:53.996 --> 43:56.762
Where is Kai now, I wonder?

43:56.764 --> 43:59.064
I think he realized he
was wrong and came back.

43:59.066 --> 44:01.767
Have you thought it over?

44:01.769 --> 44:04.104
Are you sure you don't want
to go back and say good-bye?

44:04.106 --> 44:06.338
Yes. It's all been decided.

44:06.340 --> 44:09.642
She doesn't need me, and
I don't need her either.

44:09.644 --> 44:11.311
Now I'm free like the wind.

44:11.313 --> 44:13.713
Hurry!

44:13.715 --> 44:16.383
Every minute counts. Only
what's most important.

44:16.385 --> 44:19.218
Gerda, don't take it too much to heart.

44:19.220 --> 44:21.354
He has nowhere to go but back to you.

44:21.356 --> 44:24.423
I'll be the first pirate
painter in history.

44:24.425 --> 44:27.026
I'll paint all the great sea battles.

44:27.028 --> 44:29.831
Like always, can't find
it when you need it.

44:30.865 --> 44:32.865
Gerda.

44:32.867 --> 44:35.300
Doesn't mean a thing to
me what happens to her now.

44:35.302 --> 44:38.104
Can't this thing go any faster?

44:38.106 --> 44:39.805
Sorry, dude.

44:39.807 --> 44:43.776
Only the doomsday itself could
make old Honey run faster.

44:43.778 --> 44:47.248
Here it is, finally. Let's go, let's go.

44:57.358 --> 44:59.996
Gerda, no!

45:08.269 --> 45:10.372
Kai!

45:16.477 --> 45:20.682
Uh, maybe you should, like, slow down.

45:31.827 --> 45:33.126
Oh!

45:33.128 --> 45:36.762
They're alive! Thank goodness you're okay.

45:36.764 --> 45:39.231
- But where's Kai?
- We're okay, but only for a little while.

45:39.233 --> 45:42.771
- What?
- There's the canyon up ahead.

45:45.273 --> 45:47.841
Nothing fazes me, man.

45:47.843 --> 45:50.276
I'm like a total Zen meister.

45:51.747 --> 45:53.049
Gerda.

46:01.822 --> 46:03.058
Whoa!

46:09.497 --> 46:11.332
Whoa!

46:21.075 --> 46:22.876
Yay!

46:34.289 --> 46:35.954
Everyone alive?

46:35.956 --> 46:38.093
Uh-huh.

46:57.378 --> 46:58.912
Where's Kai?

46:58.914 --> 47:02.048
He sailed with Alfida. I hope they're okay.

47:02.050 --> 47:05.584
Ball!

47:12.894 --> 47:17.062
Stop it.

47:17.064 --> 47:18.400
Oh!

47:24.939 --> 47:27.073
Ah!

47:27.075 --> 47:29.274
Thank you, Rollan.

47:29.276 --> 47:31.878
Can anybody tell me what's going on here?

47:31.880 --> 47:36.416
Why are you so cold, he's
so hot, and I'm so confused?

47:36.418 --> 47:38.084
That's what we want to know.

47:38.086 --> 47:40.954
Was it you who told Rollan
about the wishing stone?

47:40.956 --> 47:42.622
Was it some kind of joke?

47:42.624 --> 47:45.425
Well, as you can see, nobody's laughing.

47:45.427 --> 47:47.292
Who told him what?

47:47.294 --> 47:50.296
I've never heard about any
wishing stone in my life.

47:50.298 --> 47:52.298
Rollan, give me that picture.

47:52.300 --> 47:56.001
Uh, I lost it, or burned it accidentally.

47:56.003 --> 47:57.937
I can't remember which.

47:57.939 --> 48:01.006
Well, about 80 percent that I lost
it and 20 percent that I burned it.

48:01.008 --> 48:03.977
The wishing stone in the forbidden cave?

48:03.979 --> 48:06.512
- Huh?
- Underneath Lake Gao.

48:06.514 --> 48:09.381
Oh, you're freaking me out, man.

48:09.383 --> 48:11.350
- We found it.
- Ah!

48:11.352 --> 48:14.053
Except we didn't get what we wished for.

48:14.055 --> 48:17.189
Instead, spirits of the
Snow Queen and the Fire King

48:17.191 --> 48:20.126
got out of the wishing stone
and possessed Rollan and me.

48:22.997 --> 48:26.936
Oh, Honey, the apocalypse is coming!

48:28.269 --> 48:30.970
Apparently, he's not as
Zen-like as he thought.

48:30.972 --> 48:33.138
Why did you enter the forbidden caves?

48:33.140 --> 48:35.642
Don't you realize there's a good
reason why they're forbidden?

48:35.644 --> 48:39.211
We'll talk about that later. Let's
focus on what we're going to do now.

48:39.213 --> 48:42.015
How should I know? What am I, Wiki-Orm?

48:42.017 --> 48:45.517
I was sure you'd help us.

48:45.519 --> 48:49.354
Maybe I could, but I have
no idea what happened to you.

48:49.356 --> 48:51.457
Oh!

48:51.459 --> 48:52.591
What's with you?

48:54.361 --> 48:56.461
What on earth is happening here?

48:56.463 --> 48:59.564
We're wasting our time.
That's what's happening to us.

48:59.566 --> 49:01.700
With the rise of the first star,

49:01.702 --> 49:04.105
our transformation will be complete.

49:05.439 --> 49:07.106
It looks like we're doomed.

49:07.108 --> 49:09.475
Are you serious?

49:09.477 --> 49:12.611
If you kept your eyes wide open more,
you wouldn't be so darn gullible!

49:12.613 --> 49:16.582
You believe anything you
hear. You're like a child.

49:16.584 --> 49:20.086
You should try spending more time in
the library researching your facts.

49:20.088 --> 49:23.523
I'm to blame? It was you who
pulled the wool over my eyes.

49:23.525 --> 49:26.091
Did you say you have a library?

49:26.093 --> 49:28.961
Of course we do. We're trolls, not
some sort of illiterate goblins.

49:28.963 --> 49:32.634
- And you have legends there?
- No, only silly comic books.

49:34.269 --> 49:36.468
Of course there are legends there!

49:36.470 --> 49:39.305
All the troll legends are gathered there.

49:39.307 --> 49:41.606
Hurry up then. We need
to get to your library.

49:41.608 --> 49:46.345
But how? Even if we make it before
sunset, we'll get caught in no time.

49:46.347 --> 49:48.981
We're right at the top
of their most-wanted list.

49:48.983 --> 49:51.249
Don't worry. We'll make
it through all right.

49:51.251 --> 49:52.654
It's our only hope.

50:11.271 --> 50:13.207
- Ah!
- Ah!

50:21.282 --> 50:24.149
Aw!

50:24.151 --> 50:28.620
Look at that! A locomotive
made of ice. All right!

50:28.622 --> 50:30.689
We'll smash our way into the city.

50:30.691 --> 50:33.425
We'll knock them out left and right.

50:33.427 --> 50:36.631
Take that. Watch out! Rollan the legend.

50:41.102 --> 50:43.202
Nah, let's use it as a distraction

50:43.204 --> 50:46.204
- and get into the library instead.
- Mm-hmm.

50:46.206 --> 50:49.177
All aboard! Your seat
numbers are on your tickets.

51:19.173 --> 51:20.305
Huh?

51:38.325 --> 51:41.227
Hurry up. We need more water quickly.

51:41.229 --> 51:44.229
Hurry up! Put out that fire quickly.

51:44.231 --> 51:48.269
I simply must have those trendy pink shoes.

51:52.206 --> 51:53.738
Move it!

51:53.740 --> 51:55.640
Have they found Gerda yet?

51:55.642 --> 51:58.244
We're looking for them,
but we need more help.

51:58.246 --> 52:00.245
Half the city is on fire.

52:00.247 --> 52:04.552
If we don't find them soon, the
entire world will be on fire.

52:12.193 --> 52:14.359
They're getting away. Seize them.

52:14.361 --> 52:16.264
But what about my shoes?

52:32.247 --> 52:34.582
Huh?

52:36.718 --> 52:39.655
One, two, pull.

52:40.655 --> 52:44.325
One, two, pull.

52:45.260 --> 52:46.195
Huh?

52:52.499 --> 52:58.271
Pirates? Oh, no, they hate reggae. Oh!

52:58.273 --> 52:59.905
For real? Do you really hate reggae?

52:59.907 --> 53:01.941
Ugh, can't bear the sound.

53:01.943 --> 53:04.544
Huh. Rahat, have you seen Gerda?

53:04.546 --> 53:07.249
You can't even imagine
what happened to her.

53:09.550 --> 53:10.751
Wow.

53:14.521 --> 53:16.689
Are you sure this is a library?

53:16.691 --> 53:19.595
It looks more like some
kind of bakery to me.

53:24.566 --> 53:26.602
Excuse me. Can you tell me...

53:27.769 --> 53:30.503
- Grandma?
- Oh, sweetie.

53:30.505 --> 53:32.637
What are you doing here?

53:32.639 --> 53:35.341
Now this library is mine,

53:35.343 --> 53:37.876
I'm trying to pose a scientific theory

53:37.878 --> 53:41.814
that digesting cookies
helps you learn new material.

53:41.816 --> 53:46.352
Who's that with you? Is that Gerda?

53:46.354 --> 53:48.354
- And who is that?
- Ah...

53:48.356 --> 53:50.856
- This is Rollan.
- Your boyfriend?

53:50.858 --> 53:52.658
No.

53:52.660 --> 53:55.760
Grams, where is the magic
stones and legends section?

53:55.762 --> 53:57.731
You need the magic section.

54:01.802 --> 54:05.740
But be careful, and don't
forget to fasten your seat belts.

54:12.380 --> 54:16.184
This elevator will take you
straight to the magic section.

54:17.918 --> 54:20.919
All right. Who wants some cookies?

54:20.921 --> 54:22.323
Oh, Grandma!

54:29.264 --> 54:30.465
Huh?

55:05.332 --> 55:07.332
Uh... Huh.

55:30.090 --> 55:32.390
Where are all the books and scrolls?

55:32.392 --> 55:34.996
This is the magic section.
What else do you want?

55:39.434 --> 55:42.801
Such magic in here. There it is!

55:42.803 --> 55:48.073
www.wishingstone.troll, edited
by Professor Troll-lo-lo.

55:48.075 --> 55:49.908
What could that possibly mean?

55:49.910 --> 55:51.843
Some kind of nonsense.

55:51.845 --> 55:54.379
You're some kind of
nonsense, and that's a link.

55:54.381 --> 55:56.050
Help me out here, please.

55:58.119 --> 56:00.885
I'll find the link,
and you find the number.

56:00.887 --> 56:02.790
It's number one.

56:05.927 --> 56:08.396
- I'm ready.
- So are we.

56:12.499 --> 56:13.966
Now what?

56:13.968 --> 56:16.001
That should've worked.

56:16.003 --> 56:17.836
We're wasting our time.

56:17.838 --> 56:19.504
Do you have any other options?

56:19.506 --> 56:21.374
You dragged us here.

56:21.376 --> 56:23.776
"The world is in danger,
and there's no time.

56:23.778 --> 56:25.577
Hey, let's go to the library."

56:25.579 --> 56:26.879
Stop it.

56:26.881 --> 56:29.981
What's next, genius, the
aquarium or the theater?

56:29.983 --> 56:31.883
Oh, maybe a fashion show.

56:31.885 --> 56:34.986
It's not my fault you stuck your
noses where you shouldn't have.

56:34.988 --> 56:39.825
Your big nose surely knows where we
shouldn't have stuck ours, sausage nose.

56:39.827 --> 56:42.428
I'll poke you with my sausage
nose, and it won't be pretty.

56:42.430 --> 56:44.129
- Please.
- Give it a try.

56:44.131 --> 56:46.664
How do you want your
sausage nose to be cooked,

56:46.666 --> 56:48.800
medium rare or well-done?

56:48.802 --> 56:51.005
Stop it already. You're
as bad as each other.

56:55.876 --> 56:57.079
- Huh?
- Huh?

57:33.180 --> 57:35.680
<i>If you desire to awaken the elements</i>

57:35.682 --> 57:37.983
<i>and to see the world
descend into chaos,</i>

57:37.985 --> 57:39.919
<i>then you must hurry on.</i>

57:39.921 --> 57:44.393
<i>Say "glacium versus ignus"
and touch the wishing stone.</i>

57:48.762 --> 57:50.631
<i>You shall be hot like fire.</i>

57:52.900 --> 57:56.901
<i>You shall be cold like ice.</i>

57:56.903 --> 58:01.675
<i>The evil force inside you
will, like a slave, reside.</i>

58:10.952 --> 58:13.852
<i>But the moment a star
appears in the view,</i>

58:13.854 --> 58:16.988
<i>the evil force will
make a slave out of you.</i>

58:16.990 --> 58:21.861
<i>If you desire to free the world from
the chaos and the strain and the stow,</i>

58:21.863 --> 58:24.762
<i>the evil force of the elements,</i>

58:24.764 --> 58:27.966
<i>then hurry, you must return,
say, "Bochum, bonis, venis"</i>

58:27.968 --> 58:30.671
<i>and touch the wishing stone.</i>

58:32.740 --> 58:35.240
It's that simple? But we must hurry.

58:35.242 --> 58:37.175
We only have one hour left.

58:37.177 --> 58:38.946
Your time is up.

58:40.780 --> 58:42.881
- Seize them!
- We'll see.

58:42.883 --> 58:44.820
- Uh, what's that?
- Huh?

58:49.523 --> 58:50.890
What's that?

58:50.892 --> 58:52.758
It's just old-fashioned pepper.

58:52.760 --> 58:54.959
No magic at all.

58:54.961 --> 58:57.695
Let us go. We're in a big hurry.

58:57.697 --> 59:01.666
There is a simple way to
get things back to normal.

59:04.604 --> 59:07.773
- Oh!
- Stop! Set them free immediately.

59:07.775 --> 59:09.240
Huh? Oh.

59:11.311 --> 59:15.648
You don't understand. We will
all die because of these two.

59:15.650 --> 59:17.916
It is you who does not understand.

59:17.918 --> 59:21.086
My grandfather used to solve
all his problems with power.

59:21.088 --> 59:24.657
It led to the troll
people nearly dying out.

59:24.659 --> 59:29.061
Whereas Gerda saved us when
our power seemed useless.

59:29.063 --> 59:31.729
I am not following in
my grandfather's steps.

59:31.731 --> 59:34.066
We won't fight evil with evil.

59:34.068 --> 59:38.137
Instead, let us help them. This is my will.

59:38.139 --> 59:40.939
Hooray! Long live Gerda!

59:40.941 --> 59:42.307
- Long live the king.
- Hooray.

59:42.309 --> 59:45.010
Gerda, I believe in you with all my heart,

59:45.012 --> 59:47.312
and I also believe you'll do it,

59:47.314 --> 59:49.284
but I can't be that sure of him.

59:56.724 --> 01:00:00.124
Aye. Understood.

01:00:00.126 --> 01:00:02.898
Then you'll have to hurry
up. The sun is setting.

01:00:04.331 --> 01:00:07.099
If you don't do it before the time,

01:00:07.101 --> 01:00:09.771
I'll have to give my final order.

01:00:18.111 --> 01:00:22.950
It looks so marvelous that I nearly
forgot about that pair of shoes.

01:00:23.985 --> 01:00:26.619
Huh? Oh!

01:00:26.621 --> 01:00:29.224
Soldiers, our motherland is in danger.

01:00:57.218 --> 01:01:00.119
I feel I'm turning into the Snow Queen.

01:01:00.121 --> 01:01:03.959
Hold on. I'm with you.

01:01:10.296 --> 01:01:12.865
Grandma Rosa, do you know
where Gerda and Orm are?

01:01:12.867 --> 01:01:17.903
I forgot. Maybe a cup of chamomile tea?

01:01:17.905 --> 01:01:20.374
- That way!
- Run.

01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:24.809
Come on, my dears.

01:01:33.688 --> 01:01:38.126
Bochum, bonis, venis.

01:01:51.037 --> 01:01:52.773
Hmph!

01:02:04.351 --> 01:02:06.350
Oh!

01:02:06.352 --> 01:02:09.854
Rollan, it worked. We did it.

01:02:09.856 --> 01:02:11.957
Rollan?

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:18.396
Oh, Rollan, it didn't work!
The spell had no effect on you.

01:02:18.398 --> 01:02:20.432
What are we going to do?

01:02:20.434 --> 01:02:23.167
Oh, no. What are we going to do?

01:02:23.169 --> 01:02:26.707
The magic didn't work. The
spell had no effect on me.

01:02:29.744 --> 01:02:31.276
Well?

01:02:31.278 --> 01:02:34.916
What if I didn't want the
spell to have an effect on me?

01:02:36.383 --> 01:02:40.452
What? I don't understand you.

01:02:40.454 --> 01:02:44.222
When I was a child, I
wanted to be a superhero,

01:02:44.224 --> 01:02:48.026
but when I grew up, I realized
I just wanted to be super,

01:02:48.028 --> 01:02:51.997
and I didn't care if I was a
superhero or a super villain.

01:02:51.999 --> 01:02:55.466
What are you talking
about? What about your mom?

01:02:55.468 --> 01:02:58.336
You said the only reason
you studied legends

01:02:58.338 --> 01:03:00.338
was so that you could find her.

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.374
The only reason I studied legends

01:03:02.376 --> 01:03:04.943
was to find a way to obtain super powers.

01:03:04.945 --> 01:03:06.812
And now I got them.

01:03:06.814 --> 01:03:10.218
Mama's fine. I lied about
her simply to win your trust.

01:03:11.785 --> 01:03:15.220
How could you lie like
that about your own mother?

01:03:15.222 --> 01:03:18.226
Actually, it's easy when
you know what you want.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.361
You don't know what you're doing.

01:03:22.363 --> 01:03:24.562
We have to stop this.

01:03:24.564 --> 01:03:26.965
Stop it?

01:03:26.967 --> 01:03:29.934
You could have stopped me while
you still had your magic powers,

01:03:29.936 --> 01:03:32.838
but you were thinking only about love.

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.209
You're such a fool.

01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:38.075
I'm a fool?

01:03:38.077 --> 01:03:41.479
Could you remind me who of
us took a stranger's advice

01:03:41.481 --> 01:03:43.448
instead of your brother's?

01:03:43.450 --> 01:03:45.550
And he warned you about me.

01:03:45.552 --> 01:03:49.120
It's not by accident that he ran
away from such a selfish girl.

01:03:51.224 --> 01:03:55.059
It's not a gift. It's a
curse. You'll lose yourself.

01:03:55.061 --> 01:03:57.229
This force will destroy you.

01:03:57.231 --> 01:03:58.767
Ow.

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:03.234
No, this force will destroy <i>you,</i>

01:04:03.236 --> 01:04:06.604
and I'll become Rollan the legend forever!

01:04:38.338 --> 01:04:39.907
Ah.

01:04:49.883 --> 01:04:51.919
Oh!

01:05:02.528 --> 01:05:04.932
Oh! Oh.

01:05:38.264 --> 01:05:40.067
Hmm.

01:05:41.468 --> 01:05:43.501
Orm, where is Gerda?

01:05:43.503 --> 01:05:45.405
She must be with Rollan.

01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:52.244
Hey, stop right there!

01:05:52.246 --> 01:05:56.184
My name is Rollan, and I
am a legend in these parts.

01:05:57.151 --> 01:05:58.119
Aaah!

01:06:01.689 --> 01:06:04.392
Stop him before it's too late!

01:06:07.528 --> 01:06:09.664
It is too late.

01:06:11.698 --> 01:06:14.135
No!

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.477
What's happening?

01:06:45.365 --> 01:06:48.402
Attack!

01:06:53.606 --> 01:06:55.142
Line up the artillery.

01:07:02.648 --> 01:07:05.452
Huh? Oh.

01:07:13.526 --> 01:07:15.063
Huh?

01:07:24.637 --> 01:07:26.239
There's no way.

01:07:28.275 --> 01:07:29.707
Gerda!

01:07:29.709 --> 01:07:31.175
Huh?

01:07:31.177 --> 01:07:33.544
Gerda!

01:07:33.546 --> 01:07:35.550
- Kai?
- Gerda!

01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:41.285
Go back. You won't be able to help me.

01:07:41.287 --> 01:07:45.690
It's only my fault. Go back. Save yourself.

01:07:48.594 --> 01:07:50.796
She's right. You won't make it across.

01:07:50.798 --> 01:07:53.001
That's the road to death.

01:08:20.193 --> 01:08:22.062
Ah!

01:08:32.538 --> 01:08:33.808
Oh.

01:08:53.594 --> 01:08:56.227
Hmm. Oh!

01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:58.299
Ooh! Aaah!

01:09:00.733 --> 01:09:03.737
Uh...

01:09:06.173 --> 01:09:08.305
Ah!

01:09:08.308 --> 01:09:10.178
Ooh.

01:09:15.848 --> 01:09:19.316
Kai, you came to save me.

01:09:19.318 --> 01:09:22.589
You're my sister, and I'll
always have your back too.

01:09:32.366 --> 01:09:34.202
Ah.

01:09:45.745 --> 01:09:48.148
Hold on. I'll get you out of there.

01:10:01.228 --> 01:10:02.630
Fire!

01:10:17.911 --> 01:10:20.715
Waah!

01:10:23.916 --> 01:10:26.351
Are you okay?

01:10:32.759 --> 01:10:35.696
- Aaah!
- Huh? Whoa!

01:10:48.741 --> 01:10:51.342
Fall back. We're retreating.

01:10:51.344 --> 01:10:53.778
But, Your Majesty, you can't retreat.

01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:55.946
- Gerda?
- We have to stop him.

01:10:55.948 --> 01:10:58.416
Otherwise, the destruction
he's going to cause

01:10:58.418 --> 01:11:00.955
will make the Snow Queen look
like a sweet little schoolgirl.

01:11:02.356 --> 01:11:04.492
Idiots! Save the queen!

01:11:05.392 --> 01:11:08.296
No! My precious.

01:11:16.469 --> 01:11:17.938
What else could we throw at him?

01:11:21.575 --> 01:11:23.842
Right now there's nothing we can do.

01:11:23.844 --> 01:11:26.247
Our weapons are useless to defeat him.

01:11:35.921 --> 01:11:37.758
Thank you.

01:11:39.358 --> 01:11:41.493
Oh! You don't need to defeat him.

01:11:41.495 --> 01:11:43.595
You need to put him out.

01:11:43.597 --> 01:11:47.298
We've been trying to put him out for a
whole hour. It's obviously not working.

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:50.435
- I mean, you need to water him.
- What?

01:11:50.437 --> 01:11:53.837
For crying out loud! You
need to extinguish him.

01:11:55.675 --> 01:11:58.043
Gerda, you're a genius!

01:11:58.045 --> 01:12:00.845
If this works, I'm going
to make you a general.

01:12:00.847 --> 01:12:04.018
You'll be fat and rich and
able to boss everyone around.

01:12:06.853 --> 01:12:10.888
Careful, you. This is a
220-year-old loto chellollo.

01:12:10.890 --> 01:12:13.361
Every drop of it is precious.

01:12:15.661 --> 01:12:17.264
Quick, take it all.

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:31.342
I don't think he'll
appreciate the complex bouquet.

01:12:31.344 --> 01:12:33.813
Load, ready, fire!

01:12:50.429 --> 01:12:52.696
It worked. He's down!

01:12:52.698 --> 01:12:54.798
Excellent swill.

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.002
Hey, you! I need a couple
of barrels for my next party.

01:13:02.843 --> 01:13:03.811
Hmm.

01:13:15.722 --> 01:13:17.957
Water this rascal down.

01:13:22.595 --> 01:13:23.531
Load!

01:13:43.983 --> 01:13:46.853
Just a little bit more, and we'll
knock him down into the lake.

01:13:48.588 --> 01:13:50.555
Finish him!

01:13:51.991 --> 01:13:54.525
We don't have anymore left.

01:13:54.527 --> 01:13:56.863
- We're out of barrels.
- What?

01:14:10.811 --> 01:14:12.776
- Uh...
- Uh...

01:14:12.778 --> 01:14:15.046
Oh!

01:14:15.048 --> 01:14:17.050
Step back. Let's get out of here.

01:14:18.552 --> 01:14:20.121
Come on!

01:14:27.994 --> 01:14:30.194
Look out!

01:14:41.073 --> 01:14:42.175
Gerda!

01:15:40.299 --> 01:15:41.568
No!

01:17:02.115 --> 01:17:05.149
I... I can't believe she's gone.

01:17:05.151 --> 01:17:06.883
She was so brave.

01:17:06.885 --> 01:17:09.186
Aye, that she was.

01:17:09.188 --> 01:17:12.222
A braver lass never walked
the face of the earth.

01:17:12.224 --> 01:17:16.159
And she deserved a far better
fate than Davy Jones' locker.

01:17:16.161 --> 01:17:18.962
She saved us again.

01:17:18.964 --> 01:17:23.803
I hereby pronounce her Generalissimo Gerda.

01:17:29.308 --> 01:17:32.776
I never thanked her for
everything she did for me.

01:17:32.778 --> 01:17:34.846
Thank you, Gerda.

01:17:34.848 --> 01:17:37.748
It's been my pleasure,
Kai. Don't mention it.

01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:40.083
Funny. I can almost still hear

01:17:40.085 --> 01:17:43.421
her sweet, kind, gentle voice.

01:17:43.423 --> 01:17:46.356
Me too. It's almost spooky-like.

01:17:46.358 --> 01:17:50.293
Uh, did anyone think about
jumping in there to go look for me?

01:17:50.295 --> 01:17:52.396
No, because there's no way

01:17:52.398 --> 01:17:54.132
that you could have survived that fall.

01:17:54.134 --> 01:17:56.700
Actually, I might beg to differ.

01:17:56.702 --> 01:17:59.136
She's right. I've gotta try anyway.

01:18:00.939 --> 01:18:03.240
Gerda, you're alive!

01:18:07.112 --> 01:18:10.047
I'm so sorry I told you I didn't need you.

01:18:10.049 --> 01:18:13.117
Forgive me, please. You were right.

01:18:13.119 --> 01:18:15.453
I was so egotistical.

01:18:15.455 --> 01:18:18.855
From now on, you can
call us Hansel and Gretel.

01:18:18.857 --> 01:18:21.859
It doesn't matter now. You're my family.

01:18:21.861 --> 01:18:24.962
Although it's only a small
one, it's all that matters.

01:18:24.964 --> 01:18:27.832
- Brother.
- Hooray!

01:18:29.803 --> 01:18:31.271
- Yes!
- Hooray!

01:18:34.307 --> 01:18:35.876
Hmm.

01:18:38.244 --> 01:18:40.912
What makes me really confused

01:18:40.914 --> 01:18:43.114
is that how this fragile girl

01:18:43.116 --> 01:18:45.882
can be such a brave soldier at heart.

01:18:45.884 --> 01:18:48.285
You acted very insightfully

01:18:48.287 --> 01:18:51.422
from the very beginning, Your Majesty.

01:18:51.424 --> 01:18:55.827
Your grandfather would have
been really proud of you.

01:18:55.829 --> 01:18:59.198
- You think so?
- Everyone thinks so.

01:19:00.866 --> 01:19:03.367
What should we do with them,
throw them into the lake?

01:19:03.369 --> 01:19:05.903
Why throw them into the lake?

01:19:05.905 --> 01:19:09.774
Throw them into the furnace.
We'll put them all to work.

01:19:18.250 --> 01:19:20.920
Farewell!

01:19:23.255 --> 01:19:26.224
So this is what you asked
the wishing stone to give you?

01:19:26.226 --> 01:19:29.993
To make the trolls present us
with this huge pile of gold?

01:19:29.995 --> 01:19:33.931
Of course not. That must
be King Arrog's gift.

01:19:33.933 --> 01:19:37.534
I think he's thankful that
this whole story ended up well.

01:19:37.536 --> 01:19:40.137
And now we're sailing away.

01:19:40.139 --> 01:19:42.205
Tell me honestly what you wished for

01:19:42.207 --> 01:19:44.111
when you found the wishing stone.

01:19:45.245 --> 01:19:48.512
I wished for our parents to return.

01:19:48.514 --> 01:19:51.485
Unfortunately, the legend about
the wishing stone was a lie.

01:19:55.254 --> 01:19:56.856
Aha.

01:20:19.278 --> 01:20:21.212
Hmm.
Mm-mm-mm.

01:20:51.244 --> 01:20:53.246
Father.

01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:55.212
- Gerda.
- Kai.

01:20:55.214 --> 01:20:56.614
- Kai.
- Gerda.

01:20:56.616 --> 01:20:58.252
We missed you.
