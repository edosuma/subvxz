00:03.803 --> 00:05.338
- I love the ocean.

00:07.307 --> 00:08.708
It's so beautiful.

00:10.276 --> 00:11.511
And frightening.

00:12.946 --> 00:16.515
Considering the things
that I've done,

00:16.516 --> 00:19.019
seems like an appropriate
place for me to be buried.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.983
- Look, the whole case is farce.

00:50.984 --> 00:52.484
The judge is up for reelection,

00:52.485 --> 00:54.685
tryin' to look tough on the
whole organized crime thing.

00:54.709 --> 00:57.289
Using our boy, Sonny Smith,

00:57.290 --> 00:59.658
as some sort of example.

00:59.659 --> 01:02.161
He is a legit businessman.

01:02.162 --> 01:05.096
I mean so what, so what, he
owns a few Miami strip clubs.

01:05.098 --> 01:06.999
They're gonna lynch
him in town square?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.640
Who do you think pays
the strippers' rent?

01:08.664 --> 01:11.003
The judge and his
buddy politicians.

01:11.004 --> 01:12.538
They want lap dance
after lap dance

01:12.539 --> 01:13.939
and they even take 'em home.

01:13.940 --> 01:15.374
It's exactly what happened.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.375
But now I'm dealin' with
this whole tax fraud thing

01:17.376 --> 01:18.496
that I have to take care of,

01:18.520 --> 01:20.546
but it is all under control.

01:20.547 --> 01:22.282
I got this, I hit ya back.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.255
Well good morning, ladies.

02:03.256 --> 02:05.376
Why so bright-eyed and
bushy-tailed this morning, huh?

02:09.294 --> 02:10.762
Hey, it's Peter.

02:10.763 --> 02:12.831
- You forgot my birthday,
did you even realize that?

02:12.832 --> 02:15.934
- Elaine, I'm so
sorry, sweetie, I.

02:15.935 --> 02:18.737
I didn't miss your birthday,
I rescheduled it.

02:18.738 --> 02:20.939
- You can't reschedule
a birthday.

02:20.940 --> 02:23.709
What sleazeball criminal did
you help get off this time?

02:23.710 --> 02:25.750
- Honey, I didn't hear you
complain about my clients

02:25.774 --> 02:27.646
when I was takin'
on fancy vacations,

02:27.647 --> 02:29.815
buying you nice
jewelry and clothes.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.817
- I never asked for any of that.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.720
Do you ever think
that maybe I worry

02:34.721 --> 02:36.555
that you're gonna turn up dead

02:36.556 --> 02:39.291
and I'm gonna wake up with
a horse head in my bed?

02:39.292 --> 02:40.772
- Honey, can we talk
about this later?

02:40.796 --> 02:43.599
- Peter, you work with
all kinds of criminals.

02:44.664 --> 02:48.300
- Honey, baby, listen, how 'bout
I come over later tonight

02:48.301 --> 02:49.835
for some dinner, 'kay?

02:49.836 --> 02:51.370
And I'll make it up
to you, I promise,

02:51.371 --> 02:53.652
but right now I have to get to
an important meeting, okay?

02:53.676 --> 02:56.542
- Oh, oh yeah, is that what
you call it when you, uh,

02:56.543 --> 02:59.179
meet a drug lord
in a strip club?

03:00.613 --> 03:02.853
You know what, you're never
gonna change, are you, Peter?

03:02.854 --> 03:04.421
- Honey, can we talk
about this later?

03:04.422 --> 03:06.118
- No, you know, you know what?

03:06.119 --> 03:08.487
I'm sorry, I'm done. - Elaine.

03:08.488 --> 03:10.956
- I am in a relationship
with the Dish Network.

03:10.957 --> 03:12.257
- Elaine, wait.
- I'm done.

03:12.258 --> 03:13.393
- Elaine.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.831
- Man, you forgot her birthday?

03:25.405 --> 03:26.873
- You know the drill.

03:28.074 --> 03:29.609
Turn around.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.083
- Is that anyway to treat
your one and only friend?

03:39.085 --> 03:41.053
- Petey.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.087
- Mrs. Smith.

03:42.088 --> 03:43.423
- Have a seat.

03:48.161 --> 03:50.829
You know, I had a shrink once

03:50.830 --> 03:52.732
that told me I had trust issues.

03:54.834 --> 03:57.103
She also told me I
spoiled my boy Sonny.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.374
She's right, I do
have trust issues.

04:03.009 --> 04:04.777
She disappeared
right after that.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.615
Don't take it personal.

04:10.717 --> 04:13.118
'Cause I just look at ya.

04:13.119 --> 04:15.989
And I say, "Oh, he might
be packin' heat."

04:20.026 --> 04:21.459
This better be good.

04:21.461 --> 04:23.662
- Look, I told ya not to worry.

04:23.663 --> 04:24.930
I've got it all under control.

04:24.931 --> 04:28.233
- That's my baby boy
we are talkin' about.

04:28.234 --> 04:29.401
- It's a done deal.

04:29.402 --> 04:31.003
- And we don't do jail.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.971
- Nobody's goin' to jail.

04:32.972 --> 04:35.507
He's more than well
compensated to take the rap.

04:35.508 --> 04:37.476
He's grateful for the
bump when we get him out.

04:37.477 --> 04:40.480
Look, Johnny's been cookin'
the books for years.

04:41.748 --> 04:43.715
Just how Sonny
told him to do it.

04:43.716 --> 04:46.184
Hell, he's the Iron
Chef of cooking books.

04:46.185 --> 04:49.621
But I promise you, your
business, on paper,

04:49.622 --> 04:52.557
looks completely
legal and legit.

04:52.558 --> 04:54.726
He knows when to
keep his mouth shut.

04:54.727 --> 04:56.062
- Course he does.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.132
Because he's just like you.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.134
- Right.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.536
- We do not tolerate
any mistakes.

05:04.537 --> 05:07.307
- Well that's good,
'cause I don't make them.

05:08.275 --> 05:09.275
- Get outta here.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.010
- Let's go, up.

05:15.214 --> 05:19.251
- Mr. Stephens, what were
your responsibilities

05:19.252 --> 05:22.954
workin' for the defendant Mr.
Sonny Smith?

05:22.955 --> 05:24.589
- I was his bookkeeper.

05:24.590 --> 05:27.093
- How long did you have
those responsibilities?

05:28.561 --> 05:30.429
- Just over six years.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.931
- But isn't it true, Mr.
Stephens,

05:32.932 --> 05:35.934
that Mr. Smith had nothing to do

05:35.935 --> 05:37.769
with the way his, his
books were handled?

05:37.770 --> 05:40.973
That actually, well, he
left 'em all up to you.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.177
Right?

05:44.711 --> 05:48.814
And so, all this business
about money laundering,

05:48.815 --> 05:50.749
probably outside of his purview.

05:50.750 --> 05:51.984
Isn't that true?

05:53.353 --> 05:56.288
And wouldn't you agree, Mr.
Stephens,

05:56.289 --> 05:59.057
that the Smith Shipping Company,

05:59.058 --> 06:01.293
well, it's way too big

06:01.294 --> 06:05.297
for one man to watch how
every single penny is spent.

06:05.298 --> 06:06.399
Unless.

06:09.902 --> 06:12.971
Well, unless

06:12.972 --> 06:16.309
it was his one and only job.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.814
As it was yours.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.953
Isn't that right, Mr. Stephens?

06:30.156 --> 06:31.858
Do you need a tissue, Mr.
Stephens?

06:32.925 --> 06:35.094
- Mr. Stephens,
answer the question.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.473
- Yesterday afternoon,
I found out

06:48.474 --> 06:50.243
that I have pancreatic cancer.

06:52.812 --> 06:54.113
And that it's terminal.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.384
I think it's time I
did the right thing.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.253
- Look, Johnny.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.654
Look, I'm sure everyone in here

07:02.655 --> 07:04.655
is really sorry to hear
about your health problems.

07:05.792 --> 07:07.860
But I'm gonna need
your answer here.

07:10.530 --> 07:14.399
Wasn't it you, and you alone,

07:14.400 --> 07:18.003
that dealt with all the
money for Mr. Smith

07:18.004 --> 07:21.808
and his shipping company based
in the port of New Orleans?

07:25.845 --> 07:27.079
Come on, Johnny.

07:28.247 --> 07:29.482
- Not exactly.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.818
- That is not,

07:32.819 --> 07:34.920
that is not what you
previously stated under oath.

07:34.921 --> 07:37.256
- I was scared, what
do you want me to say?

07:38.124 --> 07:39.791
I lied.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.260
I mean, Sonny's been
payin' me for years

07:42.261 --> 07:43.695
to doctor the books.

07:43.696 --> 07:45.530
To do whatever it
takes to make sure

07:45.531 --> 07:47.332
the operation runs smoothly.

07:47.333 --> 07:48.893
- Mr. Stephens.
- Because you don't tell

07:48.917 --> 07:50.385
people like the Smiths "no."

07:51.170 --> 07:53.939
Besides, they paid me an
exorbitant amount of money.

07:53.940 --> 07:56.608
$250,000 at first
to take the fall,

07:56.609 --> 07:59.044
then another quarter million
when I got outta jail,

07:59.045 --> 08:01.379
and I got to keep my job.

08:01.380 --> 08:04.250
I've seen a lot of bad
things in my life.

08:05.785 --> 08:08.386
And I've never done
anything about it.

08:08.387 --> 08:10.122
Well now it's time to
do the right thing.

08:11.190 --> 08:13.725
You know, you hear these
stories about people...

08:13.726 --> 08:15.594
- Mr. Stephens, please
take your seat.

08:15.595 --> 08:17.930
- Havin' these
come-to-Jesus moments.

08:19.098 --> 08:20.432
Well I'm pretty
sure this is mine.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.234
- Mr. Stephens, take your seat.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.668
- And I can tell you right now,

08:23.669 --> 08:28.039
that man is a criminal, a
drug dealer, and a murderer.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.441
- Mr. Stephens, take your seat.

08:29.442 --> 08:30.842
- And I'm no better,
and I'm turnin'

08:30.866 --> 08:32.177
my life to God. - Objection!

08:32.178 --> 08:33.778
- And it feels so good!

08:33.779 --> 08:36.047
- He cannot, you
can't prove that!

08:36.048 --> 08:37.948
- You can't! Your honor!
- Sit down!

08:37.950 --> 08:39.618
- Your honor, I want,
I want a doctor

08:39.619 --> 08:43.054
to prove this man is
mentally fit to testify!

08:43.054 --> 08:45.690
Judge, your honor, your honor...

08:45.691 --> 08:48.627
- Mr. Franklin, is
there anything else

08:48.628 --> 08:50.930
you'd like to ask Mr. Stephens?

08:57.270 --> 08:59.705
- No, nothing.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.282
- I'm gonna kill you.

09:10.950 --> 09:12.450
- Is that a threat?

09:12.451 --> 09:13.886
In a courtroom?

09:14.887 --> 09:17.523
- No, it's a promise.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.298
- Mr. Franklin.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.166
Are you all right?

09:28.167 --> 09:30.769
- I'm okay, your honor,
just gettin' some water.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.371
- Bury him with Johnny.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.511
- I never saw this coming.

09:48.487 --> 09:49.622
Hey, wait!

09:51.057 --> 09:52.792
Hey wait, stop, stop, stop!

09:56.195 --> 09:58.264
- Sure you don't wanna
take her for a spin?

09:59.498 --> 10:01.967
- Nope, bought it good.

10:01.968 --> 10:03.768
- Put the new
plates in the mail.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.137
Sucker.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.616
- Fuck!

10:17.617 --> 10:18.718
Fuck!

10:23.289 --> 10:24.389
Miss Smith.

10:24.390 --> 10:25.390
- Petey.

10:26.525 --> 10:28.593
Hey, so it looks like

10:28.594 --> 10:32.297
you are headin'
south on the 405.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.165
In Los Angeles.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.334
Is Disneyland on
your bucket list?

10:36.335 --> 10:37.869
- Why do you think I'm in LA?

10:37.870 --> 10:40.039
- Sonny is a little upset.

10:42.108 --> 10:43.542
He don't like jail food.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.579
When Sonny gets a little upset,

10:47.580 --> 10:49.514
Mama gets real upset.

10:49.515 --> 10:52.217
- Please, Miss Smith,
just trust me.

10:52.218 --> 10:53.718
- I am gonna find you.

10:53.719 --> 10:56.287
At that happiest place on earth.

10:56.288 --> 11:00.092
And I am gonna blow
your fuckin' head off.

11:02.928 --> 11:04.263
Have a nice day.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.742
What do you want?

11:17.743 --> 11:18.911
What are you lookin' at?

11:20.079 --> 11:21.514
- Find me now, bitch.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.384
- You!

11:27.420 --> 11:28.621
Finish him.

11:55.347 --> 11:58.184
- Christ, I'm a dead man.

12:04.090 --> 12:06.726
Where the fuck am I?

12:15.034 --> 12:16.168
Texas.

12:17.603 --> 12:18.704
Yeehaw.

12:23.442 --> 12:24.643
Juniper.

12:26.312 --> 12:27.947
Good luck findin' me here.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.590
- Hey, what are ya lookin' for?

12:38.758 --> 12:39.758
- How do I pay?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.392
- You're lookin' at it.

12:41.393 --> 12:42.393
Go ahead and pump it.

12:42.394 --> 12:43.729
- Yeah?
- Yes.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.665
I like them shoes.

12:47.666 --> 12:49.068
What do ya call 'em?

12:51.103 --> 12:52.204
- My shoes?

12:53.906 --> 12:55.141
Gucci.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.478
That's funny.
- So where ya headed?

13:00.679 --> 13:02.080
- I'm not sure yet.

13:02.081 --> 13:05.316
I'm, uh, lookin' to relocate.

13:05.317 --> 13:07.619
- Fella like you
movin' to Juniper?

13:07.620 --> 13:09.321
Must either be crazy or...

13:10.723 --> 13:12.458
Somebody lookin' for you?

13:13.959 --> 13:16.240
- I don't really think that's
any of your business, right?

13:16.264 --> 13:18.229
- You know, Mister,
pretty much everybody

13:18.230 --> 13:20.331
that wants to live
here already does.

13:20.332 --> 13:22.767
But, hey, you're lookin'
for a place to stay,

13:22.768 --> 13:23.928
I hear they're tryin' to rent

13:23.952 --> 13:26.171
ole Chigger
Chastain's place out.

13:26.172 --> 13:28.339
- Where, uh, where
might that be?

13:28.340 --> 13:30.309
- Ah, tell ya what.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.212
See that boy with the
mower across the way?

13:34.213 --> 13:35.246
- With the dog?

13:35.247 --> 13:36.247
- Yeah.

13:36.248 --> 13:37.415
That's Tiger.

13:37.416 --> 13:40.084
He's, uh, well, he's special.

13:40.085 --> 13:41.619
Anyway, you just
follow him home.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.756

17:19.838 --> 17:21.339
So if I was you,
I'd stay inside.

17:21.339 --> 17:23.260
It'd be a shame if you

Wouldn't want you

18:25.838 --> 18:27.772
- Now, Roy.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.108
That ain't no way to
talk to our guest.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.943
- A scientific fact, Nana.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.344
- Uh, well, Frank.

18:33.345 --> 18:34.880
Where'd you say you was from?

18:36.248 --> 18:38.716
- Back east, New York.

18:38.717 --> 18:40.952
- I had you pegged for a Yankee.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.054
You workin' over at the plant?

18:43.055 --> 18:44.890
- No, I'm, uh, I'm a writer.

18:46.158 --> 18:48.392
I'm actually finishing a novel.

18:48.393 --> 18:50.528
- Good boy.

18:50.529 --> 18:53.131
- Tiger, do you always
feed Buddy at the table?

18:53.132 --> 18:54.499
- Of course I do.

18:54.500 --> 18:55.733
He's Buddy.

18:55.734 --> 18:58.202
And he's my very best buddy.

18:58.203 --> 19:00.104
- Only 'cause you
can't get any girls.

19:00.105 --> 19:02.039
- That, that's a
big fat lie, Roy.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.274
- Really?

19:03.275 --> 19:05.075
How come all I see you
with is your lawnmower,

19:05.099 --> 19:07.678
them damn firecrackers,
and that smelly dog?

19:07.679 --> 19:09.180
- Buddy don't smell.

19:09.181 --> 19:10.082
- Yeah he does.

19:10.083 --> 19:11.315
- No, no he don't.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.085
- Yeah he does.

Hey, babe.

Yep, hey, one second.

Excuse me.

19:20.626 --> 19:22.126

19:22.127 --> 19:23.895
- It's a hot girl, so that'd
be none of your damn business.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.463
- It's a school night, Roy.

19:25.464 --> 19:26.864
Now don't be out too late.

19:26.865 --> 19:28.333

19:37.109 --> 19:39.377
His, uh, charming personality?

19:39.378 --> 19:42.780

19:42.781 --> 19:46.285
And girls like boys
who play football.

19:48.153 --> 19:49.354

25:29.628 --> 25:32.196
What brings you

- Guess not, well if you can
find something interesting

25:43.623 --> 25:46.443

got quite an imagination.

25:46.444 --> 25:48.212
Uh, do you know where Roy's at?

26:05.897 --> 26:07.598
- Allison likes me.

26:07.599 --> 26:09.601
I, I got me a girlfriend.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.520
- When are you
gonna finish this?

26:29.521 --> 26:31.256
- Workin' on it.

26:33.491 --> 26:34.559
- Well.

26:35.727 --> 26:37.461
It's gotta be done.

26:37.462 --> 26:39.530
Just stop your bitchin'.

26:39.531 --> 26:41.131
- I'm not bitchin'.

26:41.132 --> 26:42.434
- Okay.

26:43.435 --> 26:46.570
What's this I hear about
you goin' out for, uh,

26:46.571 --> 26:48.172
homecomin' queen?

26:48.173 --> 26:50.508
- You ain't gotta worry
about it, I'm not doin' it.

26:55.380 --> 26:56.914
- Why not?

26:56.915 --> 26:59.235
You're the best-lookin' thing
in this town since your mama.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.120
- Well thank you, but we'd
have to find a formal dress

27:03.121 --> 27:05.956
and we just don't have that
kind of money right now.

27:05.957 --> 27:08.326
- Ah, so it's all my fault?

27:10.562 --> 27:12.122
- Well if you didn't
drink and piss away

27:12.146 --> 27:14.198
everything you make.

27:14.199 --> 27:15.533
- What'd you say?

27:17.068 --> 27:18.670
Hey, what'd you say?

27:21.272 --> 27:24.209
You better watch that wise-ass
mouth of yours, little girl.

27:25.844 --> 27:28.146
You gonna get yourself
in big trouble.

27:32.784 --> 27:34.019
You hear me?

27:35.120 --> 27:36.721
Huh? - Yeah.

27:37.722 --> 27:38.757
- Yeah?

27:42.394 --> 27:43.595
All right.

27:46.097 --> 27:48.166
You can get all this
shit outta here.

28:08.987 --> 28:10.755
- Tiger! Tiger!

28:11.790 --> 28:14.058
Tiger, hey.

28:14.059 --> 28:15.225
What are you doin'?

28:15.226 --> 28:17.394
- Your lawn needs, needs
cuttin' real bad.

28:17.395 --> 28:18.562
Can't you see?

28:18.563 --> 28:20.464
- I can see that,
Tiger, but I don't.

28:20.465 --> 28:22.399
- First time's free.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.468
And, and, and since
this one's so small,

28:24.469 --> 28:26.670
I'll do it twice for nothin'.

28:26.671 --> 28:30.341
After that it's, um,
three times for $20.

28:31.276 --> 28:33.377
Or four times for 15.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.512
- Are you sure?

28:35.513 --> 28:37.681
- I'm sorry but
that's just business.

28:37.682 --> 28:40.285
- Wow, is that how you
get all your customers?

28:41.786 --> 28:43.754
Well you are very smart.

28:43.755 --> 28:47.157
- No, no, not me,
but Buddy, he's,

28:47.158 --> 28:48.659
he's the smartest dog ever.

28:48.660 --> 28:49.693
- Is he?

28:49.694 --> 28:50.961
- Mm hmm.
- Yeah?

28:50.962 --> 28:52.196
You sure love him.

28:52.197 --> 28:53.797
- Of course I do, Buddy.

28:53.798 --> 28:55.099
He's my best buddy.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.334
- Hi, Buddy.

28:57.335 --> 29:01.004
All right, Tiger, well thank
you for cuttin' our grass.

29:01.005 --> 29:01.940
- Okay.
- Lord knows

29:01.941 --> 29:03.040
nobody else'll do it.

29:03.041 --> 29:04.743
Thank you.

29:12.817 --> 29:13.818
- Buddy.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.822
Buddy, I, I got me a girlfriend.

29:22.727 --> 29:24.261
- Hey, you've reached Elaine.

29:24.262 --> 29:26.563
Leave me a message and I
will call you right back.

29:26.564 --> 29:27.632
Thanks, bye.

30:05.136 --> 30:06.370
- Hi.

30:06.371 --> 30:07.504
Brenda?

30:07.505 --> 30:09.406
- Betty.

30:09.407 --> 30:11.609
What can I do for you, Mr.
Stephens?

30:13.645 --> 30:14.946
- They're very good.

30:19.117 --> 30:21.718
My God, my God, Betty.

30:21.719 --> 30:23.654
This pie, I, I can't
even describe it.

30:23.655 --> 30:24.989
It's like crack.

30:26.624 --> 30:29.059
You're a crack dealer, Betty.

30:29.060 --> 30:31.296
- Well I'm sure
that's a compliment.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.500
So I hear you're a writer.

30:36.501 --> 30:39.236
That sounds pretty excitin'.

30:39.237 --> 30:40.505
- Not really.

30:41.639 --> 30:43.174
It's a lot of alone time.

30:44.742 --> 30:46.711
- I like to read romance novels.

30:47.946 --> 30:50.849
I know it's silly,
but I just love 'em.

30:53.618 --> 30:57.487
- I can imagine livin'
in a place like this,

30:57.488 --> 31:00.257
you probably wanna
escape somehow.

31:00.258 --> 31:02.193
You guys don't even
have a movie theater.

31:03.161 --> 31:05.796
- There's a lot of
fine folk livin' here.

31:05.797 --> 31:08.499
Good people, just
tryin' to get by.

31:09.467 --> 31:12.336
It would be nice to
travel more though.

31:12.337 --> 31:13.571
See the world.

31:15.640 --> 31:18.942
- Well maybe when Lanny
retires, you can.

31:18.943 --> 31:21.278
- Retire, shoot.

31:21.279 --> 31:24.182
Around here, if you're not
workin', you must be dead.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.318
- Like Chigger?

31:29.087 --> 31:31.822
- You want another piece of pie?

31:31.823 --> 31:33.358
- You even need to ask?

31:34.525 --> 31:36.127
Thank you.

31:37.695 --> 31:40.899
- Well, Chigger was gone long
before he pulled that trigger.

31:42.834 --> 31:44.936
He got hooked on
that awful meth.

31:46.404 --> 31:49.306
You know who got him
hooked, don't ya?

31:49.307 --> 31:51.608
Tiger and Roy's daddy.

31:51.609 --> 31:53.510
Can you believe, he
used to cook that stuff

31:53.511 --> 31:55.646
right in the house?

31:55.647 --> 31:58.650
With them babies runnin'
around all over the place.

32:01.452 --> 32:03.922
It's no wonder Tiger
turned out the way he did.

32:06.324 --> 32:08.759
- What about their mother?

32:08.760 --> 32:11.662
- Their daddy went crazy one
day and shot their mama.

32:11.663 --> 32:14.531
Then himself.

32:14.532 --> 32:16.501
Guess that was right
after Roy was born.

32:18.803 --> 32:20.637
- Why?

32:20.638 --> 32:23.074
- Guess he thought she
was cheatin', somethin'.

32:24.342 --> 32:25.810
Who knows?

32:27.712 --> 32:30.781
I tell ya, I'm not one to
speak ill of the dead,

32:30.782 --> 32:33.817
but between you, me,
and the fence post,

32:33.818 --> 32:36.253
I wouldn't be
surprised if she was.

32:36.254 --> 32:38.622
She was a whore.

32:38.623 --> 32:40.692
And everybody in town knew it.

32:42.193 --> 32:44.528
A lot of people
say he killed her

32:44.529 --> 32:46.998
'cause he found out
that Roy weren't his.

32:48.833 --> 32:50.735
- And you guys say
this place is boring.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.430
- Well it's a good thing
those boys had their nana

32:54.454 --> 32:55.722
to take 'em in.

32:56.607 --> 32:58.167
I don't know what
would've become of 'em

32:58.191 --> 33:00.143
if she hadn't come
in to raise 'em.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.946
She's a goddamn saint,
I tell you what.

33:02.947 --> 33:05.049
That lady is a goddamn saint.

33:06.484 --> 33:07.785
Hell yeah.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.788
They just don't make
'em like her anymore.

33:36.881 --> 33:38.348
- Ding dong.

33:38.349 --> 33:39.483
- Who are you?

33:39.484 --> 33:42.853
- Let's just say a
friend of a friend.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.821
When someone takes off

33:44.822 --> 33:46.782
and doesn't tell their
friend where they're goin',

33:46.783 --> 33:48.450
it's kinda frustratin',
isn't it, Elaine?

33:48.451 --> 33:50.927
- I have no idea where
Peter is, Miss.

33:50.928 --> 33:52.496
- Smith.

33:52.497 --> 33:57.234
Oh come on, come on,
think real hard, Elaine.

33:57.235 --> 33:58.769
Come on, just use
your little head.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.203
Think real hard.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.139
- I don't know.

34:02.140 --> 34:04.341
- You're a very
attractive woman.

34:04.342 --> 34:05.809
- Please don't.

34:05.810 --> 34:07.850
- He hasn't reached out to
you even for a good fuck?

34:07.874 --> 34:10.510
- I haven't spoken to him
since he disappeared.

34:11.783 --> 34:14.018
- You're a terrible
liar, Elaine.

34:34.371 --> 34:35.772
- Gimme a T.

34:35.773 --> 34:37.074
- Somebody lookin'
at you, slick.

34:37.074 --> 34:38.241
- Gimme an I, I.

34:38.242 --> 34:40.143
Gimme a T, T.

34:40.143 --> 34:41.911
Gimme an E, E.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.580
Gimme an R, R.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.248
- Oh my God, a kiss.

34:46.451 --> 34:48.150
- I'm gonna hit that real soon.

34:48.152 --> 34:50.120
She ain't even gonna
see it comin'.

34:50.121 --> 34:51.922
- Hell yeah, you
lookin' good, bro.

34:53.958 --> 34:54.958
- Dad.

34:59.497 --> 35:00.498
Dad.

35:06.504 --> 35:09.172
- That was your mama's.

35:09.173 --> 35:11.208
She paid a ton of
money for that dress

35:11.209 --> 35:13.977
back when I was on the force.

35:13.978 --> 35:15.313
Only wore it once.

35:22.386 --> 35:25.489
Don't ya think
somethin' like that

35:25.490 --> 35:27.191
should be worn more than once?

35:29.427 --> 35:30.495
- Dad.

35:37.935 --> 35:39.103
Thank you.

35:40.104 --> 35:41.472
- You're welcome.

35:45.376 --> 35:49.813
You know, uh, when
you're friend there,

35:49.814 --> 35:53.049
uh, that boy Roy Mitchell

35:53.050 --> 35:55.385
sees ya in that thing,

35:55.386 --> 35:57.721
you tell him not
to get any ideas.

35:57.722 --> 35:58.722
- 'Kay.

35:59.657 --> 36:00.791
- Okay.

36:02.693 --> 36:03.861
Have fun.

36:12.303 --> 36:13.583
- You ready to go get some, Roy?

36:13.584 --> 36:14.552
- Yeah, Coach.
- Let's go.

36:14.553 --> 36:15.872
Listen, you gotta make a play.

36:15.873 --> 36:17.593
You gotta get in there
and make a play, Roy.

36:17.594 --> 36:18.628
Can you do it, son?

36:18.629 --> 36:20.043
- Yeah, Coach, yeah, Coach!

36:20.044 --> 36:22.312
- Now get your tail out
there and make a play.

36:22.313 --> 36:24.153
- I'm gonna fuckin' run
right through you, boy.

36:24.177 --> 36:25.745
I'm puttin' you right
in the ground.

36:30.288 --> 36:31.556
- Let's go, that's right!

36:32.657 --> 36:35.092
- Yeah, that a boy, Roy,
way to hit somebody!

36:36.861 --> 36:38.996
- Get 'em, let's go,
make a big hit.

36:41.899 --> 36:43.266
Let's go, that's right!

36:43.267 --> 36:45.602
- That's number
29, Roy Mitchell,

36:45.603 --> 36:47.572
makin' that sack for the Tigers.

37:00.451 --> 37:01.719
- Hey, Tiger.

37:02.687 --> 37:04.956
Your brother Roy's
pretty good, huh?

37:06.557 --> 37:08.593
- Yeah, I reckon
he's a good 'un.

37:13.331 --> 37:15.398
- Tiger, can I ask
you somethin'?

37:15.399 --> 37:17.667
- Uh huh.

37:17.668 --> 37:19.836
- How did you get
the name Tiger?

37:19.837 --> 37:22.739
- My, my mama said that
when, when I get somethin',

37:22.740 --> 37:26.076
I, I hold on to it like a tiger.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.143
- Your mom, huh?

37:27.144 --> 37:28.446
- Mm hmm.

37:30.281 --> 37:31.949
- That's a perfect
name for you, Tiger.

37:35.119 --> 37:37.587
- Allison is the
daughter of Carl Blevins

37:37.588 --> 37:38.888
and Juniper High School's

37:38.889 --> 37:41.224
1990 homecomin' queen.
- Allison!

37:41.225 --> 37:42.259
- Hi.
- LeAnn Willis.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.661
- That's my girlfriend Allison.

37:44.662 --> 37:46.464
Ain't she the prettiest one?

37:47.832 --> 37:49.266
- Yeah, Tiger, she is.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.747
- She says she plans
to attend college

37:50.771 --> 37:53.169
after graduation in
the study of nursing.

37:53.170 --> 37:56.374
Allison is escorted this
evening by Roy Mitchell.

38:02.613 --> 38:04.148
- Way to go, Allison.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.183
- Ladies and gentlemen,

38:07.184 --> 38:10.687
this year's Juniper
High homecoming queen,

38:10.688 --> 38:12.056
Allison Blevins.

38:23.868 --> 38:25.235
- Tiger.

38:25.236 --> 38:27.338
- Yeah, Alice, we
love ya, darlin'.

38:28.973 --> 38:30.308
- Tiger.

38:35.746 --> 38:37.081
- She's beautiful.

38:40.051 --> 38:42.653
Lord a mercy, baby's
got her bluejeans on.

38:44.188 --> 38:46.289
- Hey there, cowboy.

38:46.290 --> 38:48.258
I like them boots.

38:48.259 --> 38:50.160
- Oh yeah, you know,
I don't know how

38:50.161 --> 38:51.628
you guys wear these things.

38:51.629 --> 38:55.165
- Aw, they'll be fine
once you break 'em in.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.067
We're goin' shootin'
in the mornin'.

38:57.068 --> 39:00.270
We, uh, invitin' you to
come along if you want.

39:00.271 --> 39:04.774
- Oh, guys, I'd love to, you
know, but I don't got a gun.

39:04.775 --> 39:07.110
- Man without a gun.

39:07.111 --> 39:08.979
Uh, you got a pecker
down in them jeans?

39:13.050 --> 39:14.284
- I got a shitload of guns.

39:14.285 --> 39:16.786
I can let you use one of 'em.

39:16.787 --> 39:18.089
- I'm game.

39:39.477 --> 39:40.745
Hey, Tiger.

39:43.681 --> 39:44.715
You okay?

39:45.850 --> 39:47.451
- No.

39:49.120 --> 39:53.324
Allison was my girlfriend and
Roy up and stoled her from me.

39:55.326 --> 39:57.394
- Look.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.330
Maybe she wasn't the
right one for ya.

40:01.699 --> 40:04.267
- She says she likes me.

40:04.268 --> 40:07.036
She, she even kissed
me right here.

40:07.037 --> 40:10.073
- Tiger, just because a girl

40:10.074 --> 40:12.575
kisses you and says
she likes you,

40:12.576 --> 40:14.845
that doesn't mean she wants
to be your girlfriend.

40:16.213 --> 40:17.548
- Well why not?

40:18.416 --> 40:20.850
- 'Cause women are crazy.

40:20.851 --> 40:24.455
And complicated and
confusing sometimes.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.558
- You, you got a girlfriend, Mr.
Frank?

40:29.193 --> 40:30.361
- Sort of.

40:31.595 --> 40:32.897
Well I did.

40:34.365 --> 40:35.599
But she, uh.

40:38.202 --> 40:39.969
She got mad at me.

40:39.970 --> 40:41.404
- What, what for?

40:41.405 --> 40:44.374
- Lots of reasons, Tiger.

40:44.375 --> 40:46.376
And they're all my fault.

40:46.377 --> 40:47.745
So I deserved it.

40:53.417 --> 40:54.885
What are you doin' anyway?

40:55.886 --> 40:59.989
- Oh, um, I, I'm
countin' my fireworks.

40:59.990 --> 41:01.825
I, I got me the best
firework business

41:01.826 --> 41:04.027
in the whole, whole world.

41:04.028 --> 41:05.308
- You do have quite the arsenal.

41:05.332 --> 41:07.530
- Yeah, yeah, my bottle rockets,

41:07.531 --> 41:11.301
and I got firecrackers
and, and smoke bombs,

41:11.302 --> 41:12.902
and people clashers.

41:12.903 --> 41:16.006
Um, I got Roman
candles, you want some?

41:19.143 --> 41:20.577
You know, I been
tryin' to count 'em

41:20.578 --> 41:23.581
and I keep messin' up
and have to start over.

41:24.682 --> 41:26.282
- I can help you count 'em.

41:26.283 --> 41:28.551
- Really?
- Mm hmm.

41:28.552 --> 41:31.322
- You're the nicest person
I, I ever met, Mr. Frank.

41:35.259 --> 41:38.596
You sure don't seem like
anybody else around here.

41:40.798 --> 41:42.732
- What do I seem like?

41:42.733 --> 41:43.767
- Um.

41:45.069 --> 41:46.604
I, I don't know.

41:47.638 --> 41:48.939
Like.

41:50.374 --> 41:52.776
Like you don't really
got a home nowhere.

42:04.989 --> 42:06.456
- Get down, motherfuckers!

42:06.457 --> 42:08.091
- Roy, my boy!

42:08.092 --> 42:09.426
Roy, my boy!

42:10.761 --> 42:12.762
Get over here, you
son of a bitch.

42:12.763 --> 42:15.332
Hey, the beers are cold
but the women are not.

42:16.634 --> 42:19.203
- You, Simon, that
you, where's the beer?

42:20.938 --> 42:22.639
Thank you.

42:22.640 --> 42:25.241
- Hey, you get at
it yet or what?

42:25.242 --> 42:26.176
- I'm goin' to.

42:26.177 --> 42:27.711
- Yeah, you better.

42:30.147 --> 42:32.182
- Canadian mojo.
- Yeah, that's a jump start.

42:37.821 --> 42:39.222
- Where'd you get that.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.103
Boogie Night's jacket.
- It was my dad's jacket!

42:41.127 --> 42:42.425
- All right.

42:42.426 --> 42:45.529
- Naw, man, what is this
Canadian whisky bullshit?

42:50.935 --> 42:52.402
Hey, where's my queen?

42:52.403 --> 42:54.203
Queeny, I wanna see my queen.

42:54.204 --> 42:55.438
Come here, you.

42:55.439 --> 42:57.274
I want a little kiss.

42:58.876 --> 43:00.076
- Will you hold this?

43:00.077 --> 43:02.278
- Bye, guys, we'll
see you later.

43:02.279 --> 43:03.580
I'll see you later.

43:03.581 --> 43:05.248
You look so pretty over there.

43:05.249 --> 43:06.950
I saw you in the
corner of my eye,

43:06.951 --> 43:08.885
I just about went crazy.

43:08.886 --> 43:10.353
I go like this. - Like that.

43:10.354 --> 43:12.790
- And I turn ya and I dip ya.

43:14.091 --> 43:16.192
Make this.

43:16.193 --> 43:17.861
You look so pretty, honey.

43:19.229 --> 43:21.564
Do you know that? - No.

43:21.565 --> 43:23.232
- Hey, there's somethin'
happen' here.

43:23.233 --> 43:24.334
- Roy!

43:24.335 --> 43:25.669
- Hey!
- Man, get outta here.

43:27.538 --> 43:30.407
- All right, where
are you goin'?

43:33.444 --> 43:35.178
- So nice up in here.

43:35.179 --> 43:36.747
In your boots and your crown.

43:37.648 --> 43:38.948
- Yeah, no.

43:38.949 --> 43:40.149
- I thought so.

43:40.150 --> 43:41.618
I get you all to myself.

43:41.619 --> 43:42.620
- Roy.

43:43.754 --> 43:44.954
You're drunk.

43:44.955 --> 43:46.322
- Baby, uh uh.
- Mm hmm.

43:46.323 --> 43:48.324
- No I ain't, baby.
- Yeah.

43:48.325 --> 43:49.560
Roy.

43:50.227 --> 43:52.128
- Homecomin's special, you know?

43:52.129 --> 43:53.129
- Yeah.

43:53.964 --> 43:55.532
Let's go outside.

43:57.568 --> 43:58.568
Roy.

43:59.670 --> 44:00.970
Roy, no. - Just.

44:00.971 --> 44:02.605
- Roy.

44:02.606 --> 44:03.907
Roy, come on.

44:04.842 --> 44:06.709
Roy, Roy, stop.

44:06.710 --> 44:07.977
Roy, stop.

44:07.978 --> 44:11.014
Roy, stop!

44:11.015 --> 44:12.715
Roy, get off me!

44:12.716 --> 44:14.017
- It's okay, Allison.

44:14.018 --> 44:15.219
Allison, Jesus!

44:19.990 --> 44:21.290
Allison!

44:21.291 --> 44:23.427
Hey, wait, hold on,
Allison, hold on!

44:25.396 --> 44:27.263
Allison, wait!

44:27.264 --> 44:28.731
Get the fuck off of me!

44:28.732 --> 44:30.532
- Bro, that's what she,
that's what she wants.

44:30.556 --> 44:32.458
All right, have a fuckin' drink.

44:36.206 --> 44:38.342
- What the fuck are
y'all lookin' at?

44:53.023 --> 44:54.524
- Hey.

44:54.525 --> 44:55.558
- Hi.

44:55.559 --> 44:56.759
- You okay?

44:56.760 --> 44:58.061
- Yeah, I'm fine.

44:58.062 --> 44:59.295
Are you lost?

44:59.296 --> 45:01.330
- No, no, no, um, do
you guys always walk

45:01.331 --> 45:03.399
around in the dark like this?

45:03.400 --> 45:06.335
- No, uh, I just lost my ride.

45:06.336 --> 45:07.904
- Well I, I can give you a lift.

45:07.905 --> 45:08.806
- Oh no, no.

45:08.807 --> 45:09.939
- You remember me?

45:09.940 --> 45:10.940
I'm the writer.
- I remember you, yeah.

45:10.941 --> 45:12.642
I live right up there, I'm fine.

45:12.643 --> 45:15.045
- Listen, I, I can give you a
ride, it's late and it's dark.

45:15.946 --> 45:16.946
- Okay.

45:18.949 --> 45:20.049
I appreciate it.

45:20.050 --> 45:21.418
- No problem.

45:28.058 --> 45:29.792
You okay?

45:29.793 --> 45:31.594
- Yeah, I'm fine.

45:31.595 --> 45:32.755
- Do you wanna talk about it?

45:32.779 --> 45:35.531
- I don't want to talk about it.

45:35.532 --> 45:37.600
- I saw that you won
homecoming queen.

45:37.601 --> 45:39.302
You looked very beautiful.

45:39.303 --> 45:40.837
- Thank you.

45:40.838 --> 45:43.406
- You're welcome.

45:43.407 --> 45:44.907
- Been writin' lately?

45:44.908 --> 45:46.142
- Huh?

45:46.143 --> 45:49.312
- I don't think you're a writer.

45:49.313 --> 45:51.047
- How'd ya figure that out?

45:51.048 --> 45:53.282
- I could tell from
the moment I met you.

45:53.283 --> 45:55.651
- Oh yeah?
- Yep.

45:55.652 --> 45:56.954
- No, I'm not.

45:58.222 --> 45:59.723
I'm a lawyer actually.

46:03.861 --> 46:06.262
Made some very bad decisions

46:06.263 --> 46:08.831
with some very bad people.

46:08.832 --> 46:11.367
And, uh, I need to
lay low for a while

46:11.368 --> 46:13.871
so I ended up here.

46:15.005 --> 46:16.740
- This crappy little
piss-ant town.

46:18.175 --> 46:20.109
- Piss-ant.

46:20.110 --> 46:21.612
I like that word.

46:23.814 --> 46:27.083
Actually, it's been, uh,

46:27.084 --> 46:28.851
it's been a good
experience for me.

46:28.852 --> 46:30.720
I've learned a lot about myself.

46:30.721 --> 46:32.055
- Oh good.

46:34.458 --> 46:37.960
- So I'm assuming you're
not going to marry Roy.

46:37.961 --> 46:41.063
And have a bunch of homecoming
queens and football stars.

46:41.064 --> 46:42.765
- No.

46:42.766 --> 46:44.867
If I did, I would end
up like Chigger, so.

46:44.868 --> 46:45.803
- Don't say that.

46:45.804 --> 46:47.203
- No, I would.

46:47.204 --> 46:49.806
No, as soon as I graduate,
I'm outta here.

46:49.807 --> 46:53.142
- From what I hear,
Chigger was a meth head.

46:53.143 --> 46:56.145
You have a lot more going
on for yourself than that.

46:56.146 --> 46:57.581
- I hope so.

46:58.782 --> 47:01.217
- Where would you go?

47:01.218 --> 47:02.652
- I don't know.

47:02.653 --> 47:05.521
Somewhere where I
can see the ocean.

47:05.522 --> 47:07.790
Never seen it before.

47:07.791 --> 47:10.326
- You never been
to a, to an ocean?

47:10.327 --> 47:11.228
Really?

47:11.229 --> 47:12.495
- Yeah, not once.

47:12.496 --> 47:14.297
- Wow.

47:14.298 --> 47:18.935
I used to, uh, I used to
have a place in Malibu.

47:18.936 --> 47:21.604
Right on the ocean actually.

47:21.605 --> 47:24.540
Man, the sunsets are amazing.

47:24.541 --> 47:25.843
- You miss it?

47:28.278 --> 47:29.413
- Every day.

47:30.447 --> 47:32.348
- So I'm right up here.

47:32.349 --> 47:33.749
You can just pull over here.

47:33.750 --> 47:35.252
- You sure?
- Yeah.

47:38.856 --> 47:40.156
- I appreciate it.

47:40.157 --> 47:41.625
Really, thank you.

47:42.860 --> 47:44.161
- You're welcome.

47:47.165 --> 47:48.165
Hey, Allison.

47:48.166 --> 47:49.466
- Yeah?

47:50.734 --> 47:54.637
- Look, whenever
things get really bad,

47:54.638 --> 47:56.106
just think of Malibu.

47:58.842 --> 48:00.878
- Okay, thank you.

48:16.827 --> 48:18.896
- I thought me and Allison
had somethin' good goin'.

48:20.964 --> 48:22.198
Thought she was into me.

48:22.199 --> 48:24.233
I mean, you saw the way
she was lookin' at me.

48:24.234 --> 48:25.902
- I hear ya.

48:25.903 --> 48:28.404
Girls' a prick-teaser, man.

48:28.405 --> 48:29.872
You gave away all your card

48:29.873 --> 48:30.907
lettin' her treat you like
that in front of everyone.

48:30.908 --> 48:31.775
I mean.

48:31.776 --> 48:32.842
- It isn't right, is it?

48:32.843 --> 48:34.310
- Hell no it ain't right.

48:34.311 --> 48:35.611
I wouldn't let some chick
talk to me like that,

48:35.612 --> 48:37.213
and before her, you
wouldn't either.

48:37.214 --> 48:38.848
- Yeah.

48:38.849 --> 48:39.650
It ain't right!

48:39.651 --> 48:41.051
- Where ya goin'?

48:48.225 --> 48:49.459
- Allison!

48:50.327 --> 48:52.395
Hey, Allison, open the door.

48:52.396 --> 48:53.396
- Crazy son of a bitch.

48:53.397 --> 48:54.830
- Allison, just open the door.

48:54.831 --> 48:56.766
I just wanna talk to ya!

48:56.767 --> 48:58.501
So open the door!

48:58.502 --> 49:00.604
- Come on.
- So open the door!

49:06.009 --> 49:08.411
- Sometimes you're the moose.

49:08.412 --> 49:11.181
- Sometimes you're the mailbox.

49:12.482 --> 49:14.216
- Damn, how much?

49:14.217 --> 49:16.552
- Oh, let's just call it,
uh, double or nothin'.

49:16.553 --> 49:18.793
- You guys always get so boozed
up before you go huntin'?

49:18.817 --> 49:20.823
- Well, if we didn't we
wouldn't go huntin'.

49:20.824 --> 49:22.458
- Or drinkin'.

49:22.459 --> 49:24.860
- You gotts give the birds
a fightin' chance, Frank.

49:24.861 --> 49:26.596
- If I was a quail.

49:28.098 --> 49:31.902
I'd feel safe sittin' right
at the end of his gun barrel.

49:33.470 --> 49:34.971
- Amen.

49:34.972 --> 49:36.706
- You guys might
be surprised what,

49:36.707 --> 49:38.107
what I've seen at
the end of a gun.

49:38.108 --> 49:39.241
- Oh do tell.

49:39.242 --> 49:40.510
Frank, what.

49:42.746 --> 49:44.814
It's the station house,
I gotta take it.

49:44.815 --> 49:45.948
This is Dobbs.

49:45.949 --> 49:47.450
- Hey, man, you busy?

49:47.451 --> 49:49.371
- Well, yeah, I'm about
to go bird huntin', what?

49:49.372 --> 49:50.839
- Seems Carl's
girl's gone missin'.

49:50.840 --> 49:52.455
- What?
- Yep.

49:52.456 --> 49:53.456
Well he's losin' it, too.

49:53.457 --> 49:54.790
- You tell Carl.

49:54.791 --> 49:56.225
Well just keep him there.

49:56.226 --> 49:58.186
Tell him to hold his damn
horses till I get there.

49:58.210 --> 50:00.563
Carl Blevins'
daughter's missin'.

50:00.564 --> 50:02.631
- Well if you need anything,
you let us know, okay?

50:02.632 --> 50:04.066
- Yeah, same here, man.

50:04.067 --> 50:06.502
- You guys finish off
this bottle of tequila.

50:06.503 --> 50:08.138
Try not to shoot each other.

50:09.973 --> 50:11.773
That's a rain check on
the bird huntin', Stid.

50:11.797 --> 50:13.142
- Yeah.
- That ain't good.

50:13.143 --> 50:15.277
- No, it ain't, I mean, Carl's
been a damn train wreck

50:15.278 --> 50:16.712
since his wife left.

50:16.713 --> 50:19.049
I don't know what this is gonna
do to the son of a bitch.

50:22.853 --> 50:25.054
- I left her a bunch
of messages and she,

50:25.055 --> 50:28.357
she usually just calls me back.

50:28.358 --> 50:29.792
It's not like her.

50:29.793 --> 50:32.128
- Carl, you used to
be a cop, all right.

50:32.129 --> 50:34.597
So I gotta ask you.

50:34.598 --> 50:36.065
Things at home been worse
with you and Allison?

50:36.066 --> 50:37.800
- You think I'd
somethin' to my girl?

50:37.801 --> 50:39.281
You think I'd do
somethin' to my girl?

50:39.305 --> 50:40.336
- Calm down, Carl.

50:40.337 --> 50:41.570
- Huh, that's all I got!

50:41.571 --> 50:42.805
- Calm down.

50:42.806 --> 50:44.373
I just have to know
if you did somethin'

50:44.374 --> 50:45.808
that coulda made her run off.

50:45.809 --> 50:46.976
- She's not run off!

50:46.977 --> 50:48.844
She left all her stuff here.

50:48.845 --> 50:50.846
All her clothes are here.

50:50.847 --> 50:52.715
And girls don't do that,
you know that, Jeff.

50:52.716 --> 50:54.150
- All right, I, I
know you're upset.

50:54.151 --> 50:55.551
I'm upset, too.

50:55.552 --> 50:57.253
I just have to do my job.

50:57.254 --> 50:58.454
- What are you doin'?

50:58.455 --> 50:59.955
You're just wastin' your time.

50:59.956 --> 51:03.025
You should be out talkin'
to that Mitchell boy.

51:03.026 --> 51:05.961
He's the son of a
cold-blooded killer!

51:05.962 --> 51:08.397
- Carl, I just have to
have all the information

51:08.398 --> 51:09.665
to be able to do my job.

51:09.666 --> 51:10.866
Carl.

51:10.867 --> 51:11.802
- How come you're
not talkin' to him?

51:11.803 --> 51:13.002
- I will talk to him

51:13.003 --> 51:15.071
and don't jump to any
conclusions, Carl.

51:15.072 --> 51:16.352
- You don't have the time, Jeff!

51:16.353 --> 51:17.753
- I know how much
time I don't have!

51:17.777 --> 51:18.898
I'm sorry!

51:19.943 --> 51:21.744
What?

51:21.745 --> 51:23.479
- You know what's gonna happen?

51:23.480 --> 51:24.880
- What?

51:24.881 --> 51:26.816
- They found some
footprints outside

51:26.817 --> 51:29.218
the girl's window.

51:29.219 --> 51:31.721
- Call Dallas, get
forensics here, ASAP.

51:33.990 --> 51:35.125
Good work.

51:38.763 --> 51:39.763
Carl.

51:39.764 --> 51:40.864
- It's my fault.

51:43.033 --> 51:45.134
I can't do anything right.

51:45.135 --> 51:46.869
- And I can't imagine
what it must feel...

51:46.870 --> 51:49.338
- It's my fault, I
drove her away.

51:49.339 --> 51:50.840
I gotta get her back.

51:50.841 --> 51:53.175
Jeff, you gotta get her back.

51:53.176 --> 51:56.413
- I will, I'm on it, I'm
your eyes and ears, Carl.

51:57.848 --> 52:00.616
- It's my fault, I
know it's my fault.

52:00.617 --> 52:01.951
Oh Jesus.

52:01.952 --> 52:03.320
- All right, all right.

52:20.137 --> 52:21.271
- Roy Mitchell!

52:22.239 --> 52:23.906
Roy Mitchell, come out here!

52:23.907 --> 52:25.574
What'd you do with her?

52:25.575 --> 52:27.810
What'd you do with my baby?

52:27.811 --> 52:28.778
Where is she?

52:28.779 --> 52:30.446
What happened to my baby?

52:30.447 --> 52:31.447
- Hey.

52:32.516 --> 52:33.682
- You're gonna die.

52:33.683 --> 52:34.584
- Carl.

52:34.585 --> 52:35.985
- Did you kill my daughter?

52:35.986 --> 52:37.219
- What the hell is
the matter with you?

52:37.220 --> 52:38.420
What are you talkin' about?

52:38.421 --> 52:39.588
- You couldn't stay away.

52:39.589 --> 52:42.091
- Carl, what are
you talkin' about?

52:42.092 --> 52:43.292
- My Allison.

52:43.293 --> 52:45.013
- Carl, get outta here,
you dirty old drunk.

52:45.863 --> 52:46.863
- Where is she?

52:46.864 --> 52:48.063
I said where did she go?

52:48.064 --> 52:50.332
- Don't you hit my brother!

52:50.333 --> 52:51.434
- Oh, stupid kid.

52:52.369 --> 52:53.469
- What in the fuck, Carl?

52:53.470 --> 52:54.670
- Where is she?

52:54.671 --> 52:56.191
- What the fuck is
the matter with you?

52:56.674 --> 52:57.674
Hey!

52:57.675 --> 52:59.808
Get outta here, Carl, I swear.

52:59.809 --> 53:02.611
- You two, you two know
what happened to Allison.

53:02.612 --> 53:05.247
- Buddy, you okay?

53:05.248 --> 53:07.783
You're all right, you're
all right, settle down.

53:07.784 --> 53:09.318
It's okay, Carl, get outta here!

53:09.319 --> 53:10.719
- You know what
happened to my baby.

53:10.743 --> 53:12.354
- Get outta here.

53:12.355 --> 53:14.023
Oh jeez.

53:14.024 --> 53:16.126
- Oh God.
- Hey, you're okay.

53:25.503 --> 53:26.503
- Hello.

53:26.504 --> 53:29.206
- You have really pissed me off.

53:30.874 --> 53:32.576
I am coming to get you.

53:49.626 --> 53:50.693
- Hey, Roy.

53:50.694 --> 53:52.494
- What do y'all want from me?

53:52.495 --> 53:54.530
Look, Carl come over
here into my house

53:54.531 --> 53:56.611
lookin' for a fight, I didn't
go to that man's house,

53:56.635 --> 53:57.967
I didn't start no trouble,

53:57.968 --> 53:59.435
he came over here!
- Hey, hey, hey,

53:59.436 --> 54:01.596
hey, calm down, I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

54:01.620 --> 54:02.171
Calm down.

54:02.172 --> 54:04.092
Now if Carl did somethin',
I'll take care of him.

54:04.116 --> 54:05.674
It ain't about him.

54:05.675 --> 54:06.976
It's about Allison.

54:06.977 --> 54:08.377
- What about her?

54:08.378 --> 54:10.980
- What'd y'all do last night?

54:10.981 --> 54:12.881
- Went to the dance.

54:12.882 --> 54:14.049
- And?

54:14.050 --> 54:16.151
- Took her on over
to Ray's house.

54:16.152 --> 54:18.554
- 'Bout what time
of night was that?

54:18.555 --> 54:20.122
- I don't know, about
midnight I guess.

54:20.123 --> 54:22.191
- You bring her straight
home from Ray's?

54:22.192 --> 54:24.593
- I didn't take her home.

54:24.594 --> 54:25.961
- Who did?

54:25.962 --> 54:26.863
- I don't know.

54:26.864 --> 54:28.097
- She just leave?

54:28.098 --> 54:29.499
- You get in a fight?

54:31.134 --> 54:32.535
- Lover's quarrel.

54:34.704 --> 54:36.905
- What was it about?

54:36.906 --> 54:39.308
- You know how girls are.

54:39.309 --> 54:41.076
Started drinking, gettin'
flirty and stuff,

54:41.077 --> 54:42.378
and then the second you
make your move on 'em,

54:42.379 --> 54:44.280
they turn on ya like ya
done somethin' wrong.

54:44.281 --> 54:45.681
- Get used to that.

54:45.682 --> 54:49.518
- So she left the party and
you didn't go after her?

54:49.519 --> 54:52.021
- No, I didn't go after her.

54:52.022 --> 54:54.657
- Roy, you don't
seem very concerned

54:54.658 --> 54:56.526
about Allison bein' missin'.

54:57.694 --> 54:59.361
- Missin'?

54:59.362 --> 55:00.497
- Yeah.

55:03.066 --> 55:06.435
- I'm sure she'll turn up.

55:06.436 --> 55:09.405
- When do you think that'll be?

55:09.406 --> 55:10.806
- Yeah, I'm outta here.

55:10.807 --> 55:13.142
- Hey, hey, hey, it's all
right, thank ya, Tim.

55:13.143 --> 55:14.777
Listen, hey, hey.

55:14.778 --> 55:17.146
Son, we don't know where she is.

55:17.147 --> 55:18.647
I'm sure we'll find her.

55:18.648 --> 55:20.549
All right, you're right.

55:20.550 --> 55:22.619
Hey, listen, son.

55:24.187 --> 55:26.322
Some good tacklin'
you did last night.

55:26.323 --> 55:27.990
You played really hard.

55:27.991 --> 55:29.325
- You hold up for
us right there.

55:29.326 --> 55:31.860
- It's a shame y'all
didn't win that game.

55:31.861 --> 55:35.197
- I can't do everything
myself, can I?

55:35.198 --> 55:38.000
- Sure can't, I
know how you feel.

55:38.001 --> 55:39.234
Holler at us. - Jeff.

55:39.235 --> 55:40.804
- All right, Roy, thank ya, son.

55:41.838 --> 55:43.205
- Hey, listen.

55:43.206 --> 55:45.140
That shit don't fly
in Mississippi, son.

55:45.141 --> 55:47.577
- It ain't Mississippi and
I ain't your goddamn son.

55:48.678 --> 55:50.179
Hey, Tiger.

55:50.180 --> 55:51.480
Here's Tiger.

55:51.481 --> 55:53.382
Bless his heart.

55:53.383 --> 55:54.483
Hey, Tiger.

55:54.484 --> 55:56.185
- Hey, man.

55:56.186 --> 55:57.319
- How ya doin', buddy?

55:57.320 --> 55:58.620
Can we talk to you for a minute?

55:58.621 --> 56:00.055
- Sure, Mr. Officer.

56:00.056 --> 56:03.492
- It's Sheriff Jeff
but all right.

56:03.493 --> 56:04.760
How's the truck runnin'?

56:04.761 --> 56:06.161
- It, it's pretty good.

56:06.162 --> 56:07.997
- Yeah?
- Mm hmm.

56:09.432 --> 56:12.235
- Tiger, you know that
girl Allison Blevins?

56:13.536 --> 56:14.737
- Course I do.

56:14.738 --> 56:17.506
- Uh huh, well you
notice anything,

56:17.507 --> 56:20.743
you know, any problems between
Allison and Roy lately?

56:20.744 --> 56:23.645
- Mm, problems?

56:23.646 --> 56:27.649
- Yeah, like is he
actin' unusual?

56:27.650 --> 56:30.119
- Nope, Roy looks
the same to me.

56:30.120 --> 56:33.489
- All right, hey,
thank ya, Tiger.

56:33.490 --> 56:35.257
I'll see you, buddy.

56:35.258 --> 56:36.793
- All right.

56:38.428 --> 56:41.831
- But, now Allison, she looked
like she, she was cryin'.

56:43.233 --> 56:45.834
- Oh, she did, huh?

56:45.835 --> 56:48.103
You saw her last night?

56:48.104 --> 56:49.773
- Mm hmm, I sure did.

56:51.274 --> 56:53.909
She, she was cleanin'
out her garage

56:53.910 --> 56:55.911
sort, sorta cryin' and all.

56:55.912 --> 57:00.215
But she said it was,
um all, all-ergy.

57:00.216 --> 57:01.084
- Allergies.

57:01.085 --> 57:02.684
- Yeah, yeah, that's it.

57:02.685 --> 57:04.525
- That's pretty, uh,
that's pretty late, Tiger.

57:04.526 --> 57:06.093
What you doin' here
that time of night?

57:06.094 --> 57:08.524
- Oh, I like to
drive by Allison's

57:08.525 --> 57:10.692
'cause she's my girlfriend.

57:10.693 --> 57:11.693
- Really?

57:11.694 --> 57:12.629
- Sheriff.

57:12.629 --> 57:13.530
- Hey, Frank.

57:13.531 --> 57:14.696
- Frank.

57:14.697 --> 57:15.964
- Any word on the missing girl?

57:15.965 --> 57:18.100
- Hey, Frank, uh, just
tryin' to see if Tiger

57:18.101 --> 57:19.268
knows anything about her.

57:19.269 --> 57:20.736
- She say if she was
goin' somewhere?

57:20.737 --> 57:23.071
Like maybe see a
friend or somethin'?

57:23.072 --> 57:24.072
- Um.

57:25.375 --> 57:26.608
I, I don't know.

57:26.609 --> 57:28.544
She said she had to get
rid of all them boxes

57:28.545 --> 57:32.080
or her daddy'd get mad, so
I took 'em to the dump.

57:32.081 --> 57:34.616
- You mind if we take a look?

57:34.617 --> 57:36.084
- It's kinda messy and all.

57:36.085 --> 57:37.319
- It's all right.

57:37.320 --> 57:38.254
- Tiger, you don't, you
don't have to let them

57:38.254 --> 57:39.189
look in your truck.

57:39.190 --> 57:41.490
- Hey, hey, why are you talkin'?

57:41.491 --> 57:43.158
- I'm just lettin'
him know his rights.

57:43.159 --> 57:44.860
- You have the right
to butt the hell out.

57:44.861 --> 57:47.095
This is a police investigation.

57:47.096 --> 57:48.564
Come on.

57:48.565 --> 57:50.405
- Tiger, you don't, you
don't have to let them.

57:50.429 --> 57:52.431
- Not another word.

57:56.239 --> 57:58.440
- Hey, Sheriff,
you're gonna wanna

57:58.441 --> 58:00.009
take a look at this.

58:07.350 --> 58:09.685
- Tiger, can you explain this?

58:09.686 --> 58:11.254
- Um.

58:12.255 --> 58:14.536
- We're gonna have to take you
down to the station, Tiger.

58:14.560 --> 58:15.058
All right?

58:15.059 --> 58:16.225
- To the police station?

58:16.226 --> 58:17.160
- Yeah.
- Tiger, you don't, you don't

58:17.161 --> 58:18.393
have to go with them, Tiger.

58:18.394 --> 58:20.596
- Listen, you gotta
stop talkin'.

58:20.597 --> 58:22.397
- It's okay, Buddy,
we're just gonna go

58:22.398 --> 58:24.067
to the police station.

58:25.535 --> 58:27.002
- That dog ain't comin'.

58:27.003 --> 58:28.737
- He's gotta come.

58:28.738 --> 58:30.572
He gets scared if
I'm not with him.

58:30.573 --> 58:31.807
- Tough shit.
- Jeff, Jeff.

58:31.808 --> 58:33.041
Just let him take the dog.

58:33.042 --> 58:34.243
- Tim, get him in
the truck, huh?

58:34.244 --> 58:35.577
- Hey, listen, Tiger,
do not say a word

58:35.578 --> 58:36.513
unless you have an
attorney, you understand.

58:36.514 --> 58:37.754
Not until you have an attorney.

58:37.778 --> 58:39.181
- Hey, enough!
- Do you understand?

58:39.182 --> 58:40.149
- Put him in the truck or
I'll put him in the truck.

58:40.150 --> 58:41.350
What are you doin'?

58:41.351 --> 58:42.911
- Is this how the law
works around here?

58:42.935 --> 58:44.920
- I am the law
here, who are you?

58:44.921 --> 58:47.256
- Gonna talk to the sheriff.

58:47.257 --> 58:49.091
- Hey, Grandma was
slow but she was old.

58:49.092 --> 58:51.493
Get him in the damn truck, Tim.

58:51.494 --> 58:52.896
Jesus Christ.

59:06.809 --> 59:08.044
- Buddy!

59:13.483 --> 59:17.519
- So you did not follow her home

59:17.520 --> 59:20.290
and take advantage of Allison.

59:23.860 --> 59:26.795
- How many times

59:26.796 --> 59:30.098
are you gonna ask me
the same question

59:30.099 --> 59:31.968
a hundred different ways?

59:35.705 --> 59:38.307
- I'm just tryin' to understand

59:38.308 --> 59:42.111
why you don't care about your
girlfriend disappearin', Roy.

59:44.047 --> 59:45.281
- What I care about?

59:46.816 --> 59:48.985
What do you know
what I care about?

59:51.387 --> 59:52.822
You don't know me.

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:33.329
- How you doin'?

01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:35.163
- Hi, welcome to Walls Mart.

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:37.900
- I'm with the FBI,
have you seen this man?

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:42.271
If so, tell me everything
you know about him.

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:45.408
- Buddy.

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:47.242
Where?

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.013
Where did they put Buddy?

01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:00.757
Where, where, where are we?

01:01:02.358 --> 01:01:04.493
Is, is this the police station?

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:07.329
- This is hell, son.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:08.797
- Hell?

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:10.878
- And there ain't a livin'
soul that knows we're here

01:01:10.902 --> 01:01:12.871
besides me and Deputy Tim.

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:17.874
We just talked to Carl, Tiger.

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:21.309
He said that these

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:24.780
bloody clothes
belong to Allison.

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:27.216
That she was wearin' 'em
when she left the house.

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:36.625
You know, Tiger,
sometimes we do things

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.260
and we don't mean to.

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:40.263
- Like, like what?

01:01:41.497 --> 01:01:43.799
- Like sittin' outside
a girl's house

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.368
and watchin' her
through the window.

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:49.037
You went over there last night.

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:51.774
You were watchin' her
'cause you love her.

01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:55.811
Told me she was your girlfriend.

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:58.548
- She, she was my girlfriend.

01:01:59.582 --> 01:02:01.116
- Was?

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:03.085
- Roy up and stoled her from me!

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:04.820
- That's right.

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:05.887
That's right.

01:02:05.888 --> 01:02:07.923
Your own brother.

01:02:07.924 --> 01:02:10.827
That makes you really angry.

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:15.731
Angry enough to do somethin'
that you didn't wanna do.

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.165
- Yeah.

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:20.569
- Roy, a bit of a loose cannon.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:23.772
I can appreciate
that, but you don't.

01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:24.906
Got up in them drawers.

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:26.374
- No, no.

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:28.510
- Yeah he did, got in them
pants and you couldn't.

01:02:28.511 --> 01:02:29.791
- Nobody got in Allison's pants.

01:02:29.792 --> 01:02:31.352
- Really, nobody got
in Allison's pants.

01:02:31.376 --> 01:02:33.014
Then why do we have her pants

01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:35.417
covered in blood that
we found in your truck?

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:37.919
'Cause you killed her and
what'd you do to her body?

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.920
- I.

01:02:40.223 --> 01:02:41.456
I, I don't know!

01:02:41.457 --> 01:02:43.425
- Why did you kill her?
- Quit askin' me!

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:46.128
- Carl loves his
daughter Allison.

01:02:46.129 --> 01:02:49.164
More than anything
in this world.

01:02:49.165 --> 01:02:50.866
And you took her from him.

01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:52.100
- No.

01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:54.102
- And if you don't
tell me the truth.

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:56.404
Tiger, look at me.

01:02:56.405 --> 01:02:58.741
I'm gonna take
somethin' from you.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:04.112
- Is he all right?

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:05.413
- Yeah, he's all right.

01:03:05.414 --> 01:03:06.581
What, what's up?

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:08.884
- Forensics just came back.

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:11.887
Tiger's DNA's all over
the bloody clothes.

01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:14.422
- Well, evidence don't lie.

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:15.758
- I know, I just.

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.161
Tiger, Jeff.

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:21.122
I don't think he's capable
of somethin' like this.

01:03:21.146 --> 01:03:23.999
- Tim, would we be
havin' this conversation

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.300
if he wasn't slow?

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:26.968
The evidence points to him.

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:28.237
- I just.

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:32.040
- That report came
back, it says exactly

01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:34.109
what I thought it was gonna say.

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:38.246
Your DNA, your semen, your spit

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:40.683
was all over Allison's clothes.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.288
Do you hear what I'm sayin'?

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:49.457
There was a boot prints, your
boots, outside her window

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:52.261
leadin' to your truck, where
the clothes were found.

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:57.666
You killed Allison.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:58.947
- No, no!
- Why did you kill her?

01:03:58.971 --> 01:04:00.836
- No, I didn't, I
didn't kill Allison.

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:03.438
- What did you do with the body?

01:04:03.439 --> 01:04:04.439
- I.

01:04:05.808 --> 01:04:07.008
I, I don't know!

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:09.044
- Why did you kill her?
- Quit askin' me!

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:10.445
- Okay, I'm gonna
quit askin' you.

01:04:10.446 --> 01:04:11.613
You know what I'm gonna do?

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:13.094
I'm gonna make it
real simple for you.

01:04:13.118 --> 01:04:14.749
Even you understand simple.

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:16.750
Now, Tiger, if you don't
tell me the goddamn truth,

01:04:16.774 --> 01:04:19.977
so help me God, I'm gonna
take somethin' from you.

01:04:29.132 --> 01:04:30.132
- Buddy!

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:31.433
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:33.134
- I missed you so much, Buddy.

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:35.303
- You love that dog,
don't you, Tiger.

01:04:35.304 --> 01:04:37.974
- Course I do, he's
my best buddy.

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:41.576
- You'd love to take Buddy home,

01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:43.879
see Nana and Roy, wouldn't ya?

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.213
- I, I can go home?

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:46.415
- Right now.

01:04:47.683 --> 01:04:49.951
Wouldn't you love that, huh?

01:04:49.952 --> 01:04:52.821
You tell us

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:55.490
what you did to Allison Blevins

01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:58.193
or you will never. - No!

01:04:58.194 --> 01:05:00.862
- See that dog ever again!
- No!

01:05:00.863 --> 01:05:01.963
You leave Buddy alone!

01:05:01.964 --> 01:05:03.365
- I will take him!

01:05:03.366 --> 01:05:04.834
- No, Buddy!

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:08.236
Officer Tim, please!

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:10.105
Please!

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:11.741
Open, open the door.

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:14.075
- Rescue teams have concluded

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:16.044
the state-wide search for
the missing teenager

01:05:16.045 --> 01:05:18.413
Allison Blevins of
Juniper, Texas.

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:20.148
Blevins went missing
several weeks ago

01:05:20.149 --> 01:05:22.417
and is presumed dead
by local authorities.

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:24.185
The suspect, Tiger Mitchell,

01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:26.054
is going to trial
for her murder.

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:28.991
State prosecutor Reggie Huntley
has declined to comment.

01:05:29.959 --> 01:05:31.693
- When you're on the run,

01:05:31.694 --> 01:05:34.429
you learn to focus
on the here and now.

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:37.366
Because, believe me,
anything can happen.

01:05:38.534 --> 01:05:42.204
Here I am in Juniper,
Texas, small town America.

01:05:43.172 --> 01:05:46.841
Tiger's going to trial for the
murder of Allison Blevins.

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:49.444
Dobbs seems like he's
on a witch hunt.

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:50.979
Nothing adds up.

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:54.582
No body, no murder
weapon, no witnesses.

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:55.917
Nothing.

01:05:55.918 --> 01:05:57.786
The whole trial
feels like a sham,

01:05:57.787 --> 01:06:00.488
with Dobbs expediting
the whole process

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:02.791
just to get what he wants.

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.125
I could see it in her eyes.

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:05.293
Where you gonna go?

01:06:05.294 --> 01:06:07.228
She's a runner.

01:06:07.229 --> 01:06:08.430
Just like me. - I don't know.

01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:10.733
Somewhere where I
can see the ocean.

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:15.738
- I don't know what
happened to Allison.

01:06:17.206 --> 01:06:18.674
I don't know anything really.

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:24.981
Except these folks
taught me something.

01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:30.353
You can run forever.

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:35.491
But you can't run
from your heart.

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:48.704
- Are counsel for the
parties present?

01:06:50.106 --> 01:06:51.173
- Yes, your honor.

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:55.076
- Present.

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:56.557
- It's my understanding, Mr.
Franklin,

01:06:56.581 --> 01:06:58.346
that you're here representing Mr.
Mitchell

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:00.348
pro hoc vice, correct?

01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:01.583
- Yes, your honor.

01:07:01.584 --> 01:07:03.118
- Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:06.321
we're about to begin a trial.
- I like your suit.

01:07:06.322 --> 01:07:08.002
- The state of Texas
versus Tiger Mitchell.

01:07:08.026 --> 01:07:09.057
- It's my dad's.

01:07:09.058 --> 01:07:10.825
- Counsel for each
of the parties

01:07:10.826 --> 01:07:13.762
will now have an opportunity
to question you.

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:16.064
- I don't know what he's sayin'.

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:18.199
- Just, just when they ask,

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.368
all you say is "not guilty."

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:21.303
- Not guilty.

01:07:21.304 --> 01:07:22.570
- Not guilty, okay.

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:25.507
- And for the
duration of the case.

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:27.242
- Remember, "not guilty."

01:07:27.243 --> 01:07:30.445
- To witnesses and
to the court only.

01:07:30.446 --> 01:07:33.482
- We, uh, made a cast
of the imprint...

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:38.086
of the shoe of the suspect

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:41.457
after we took him into custody.

01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:46.061
- I submit to the court.

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:51.032
Exhibit C, pair of work boots

01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:52.700
worn by the defendant

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:54.236
when he was brought
in for questioning.

01:07:55.171 --> 01:07:57.506
- Let the exhibit be
received into evidence.

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:05.280
- The photographs, the boot,

01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:07.116
and the imprints.

01:08:12.721 --> 01:08:15.291
What were the results
of those lab tests?

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:20.362
- They, they matched
the shoes perfectly.

01:08:22.331 --> 01:08:23.666
- Nothin' further.

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:27.368
- You may step down, sir.

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.319
- Sheriff.

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:45.520
- Yes, sir?

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.488
- Isn't it true that
Tiger made no effort

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:49.657
to hide the bloody clothes
you found in his truck?

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:53.928
In fact, he voluntarily
informed you

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:55.596
they actually belonged
to Allison Blevins.

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:59.667
- No, we told Tiger we need
to look inside his truck.

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:01.202
He complied.

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:04.939
We found the clothes, and then
he agreed they were hers.

01:09:04.939 --> 01:09:08.542
- Well tell me, does that
sound like the behavior

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:10.778
of a, of a guilty man?

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:13.014
A man who might've
murdered someone?

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:14.616
- Objection, speculation.

01:09:14.617 --> 01:09:16.898
- I'm just asking for his
professional opinion, your honor.

01:09:16.921 --> 01:09:20.354
- Overruled, answer the
question, Sheriff.

01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:22.624
- It's highly unusual.

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:23.825
- I, I'm sorry, one more time.

01:09:23.849 --> 01:09:26.127
- Highly unusual.

01:09:26.127 --> 01:09:27.363
- No further questions.

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:32.301
- Yeah, yeah he came around.

01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:37.339
Mowed our lawn for free.

01:09:38.407 --> 01:09:42.210
Picked some flowers once,
left 'em by the door.

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:43.545
- For Allison.

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:45.346
- They sure as hell
weren't for me.

01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:51.953
- Did the defendant
ever drive by

01:09:51.953 --> 01:09:53.654
or sit outside your
house at night?

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:58.060
- Yeah, seemed like just about
every time I turned around...

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:00.563
there he was.

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:04.266
- Nothin' further.

01:10:06.268 --> 01:10:08.403
- Your witness, Mr. Franklin.

01:10:08.404 --> 01:10:12.540
- Mr. Blevins, isn't it true
that you and your daughter,

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:14.475
well you have a
bad relationship?

01:10:14.476 --> 01:10:17.680
- Well, son, we had
some tough times.

01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:20.683
I thought you were
gonna call me.

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:24.485
- My phone died, my phone
died, Dad, my phone died!

01:10:24.486 --> 01:10:25.720
- Don't mess with me!
- I'm sorry, Dad,

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:27.488
my phone died.
- I said don't mess with me!

01:10:27.489 --> 01:10:28.290
- My phone died.

01:10:28.291 --> 01:10:29.357
- What's that?

01:10:29.358 --> 01:10:30.159
- Oh my God.
- What's that, huh?

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:31.459
- Nothing, Dad, nothin'.

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.695
- Havin' a teenager
is kinda like,

01:10:33.696 --> 01:10:35.797
that goes with the territory.

01:10:35.798 --> 01:10:38.700
- Well tell me,
do drunken fights

01:10:38.701 --> 01:10:40.836
and screaming threats?

01:10:42.785 --> 01:10:44.305
Does that also come
with the territory?

01:10:44.306 --> 01:10:46.674
- Objection, totally
inflammatory.

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:49.177
- Did he lay one finger on you?

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:50.679
Just one finger!

01:10:51.981 --> 01:10:55.150
- What if he did?

01:10:56.018 --> 01:10:57.118
Don't you sass me!

01:10:57.119 --> 01:10:58.853
You understand me?

01:10:58.854 --> 01:11:00.688
I said don't sass me!

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:02.089
You know, Mr. Franklin,
I don't know

01:11:02.113 --> 01:11:04.482
where you're goin'
with this but.

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:08.697
You're just a goddamn little
whore, you know that don't ya!

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.834
Damn!

01:11:12.835 --> 01:11:15.837
I'm stayin' at Carol's, I'm
gonna stay at Carol's,

01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:18.039
and I want you to clean
up that carport.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.341
I don't think that
had anything to do

01:11:20.342 --> 01:11:22.645
with my daughter just
up and disappearin'.

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:29.551
- Of course it does.

01:11:39.261 --> 01:11:40.329
- Allison.

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:44.433
Where you at, girl?

01:11:46.035 --> 01:11:47.403
You still asleep, hon?

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:53.007
- Because that's
exactly what happened

01:11:53.008 --> 01:11:54.208
when her mother left you.

01:11:54.209 --> 01:11:55.677
- Objection!

01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:56.945
- You son of a bitch.

01:11:58.414 --> 01:12:00.783
- Order, order, strike Mr.
Franklin's comments.

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:05.220
- No further questions.

01:12:06.855 --> 01:12:08.589
- Do you solemnly
swear or affirm

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:10.758
the testimony you are about
to give is the truth,

01:12:10.759 --> 01:12:13.461
the whole truth, and nothin' but
the truth, so help you God.

01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:14.996
- Yes, sir.

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:17.765
- Mr. Hill, how long have
you known the defendant?

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:20.468
- Well, about as long as
he's been alive I reckon.

01:12:20.469 --> 01:12:22.503
- Have you ever noticed any

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:25.707
angry, violent behavior
from the defendant?

01:12:25.708 --> 01:12:27.709
- That boy wouldn't hurt a flea,

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:29.945
less of course it was makin'
that dog of his itch.

01:12:31.447 --> 01:12:32.947
- No further questions.

01:12:32.948 --> 01:12:35.350
- How come you couldn't
of told us the truth?

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:37.285
Uh, Peter.

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:38.953
- Yeah, how dumb do
you think we are?

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:40.154
- I'm sorry.

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:41.123
- Don't need your sorries.

01:12:41.124 --> 01:12:43.358
Need you to get that boy off.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:44.992
- State prosecutor
Reggie Huntley

01:12:44.993 --> 01:12:46.861
still refuses to comment.

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:49.130
Peter Franklin, New York
criminal defense attorney

01:12:49.131 --> 01:12:51.966
for the defendant Tiger Mitchell,
released this statement

01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:53.701
earlier today. - Son of a bitch.

01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:56.237
- My client is being held
with almost no evidence

01:12:56.238 --> 01:12:57.672
against him.

01:12:57.673 --> 01:13:00.074
He is clearly being coerced
by local law enforcement

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:01.709
into a false confession.

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:02.910
- More coverage on this story.

01:13:02.934 --> 01:13:05.837
- Miss Smith, you're not
gonna believe this.

01:13:10.853 --> 01:13:12.887
- May I help you fellas?

01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:14.722
- I'm Agent Brody,
this is Agent Mead.

01:13:14.723 --> 01:13:16.524
We're with the FBI.

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:19.060
Do you know this man?

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:21.963
- Nope, can't say I do.

01:13:21.964 --> 01:13:24.065
- You sure about that?

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:26.734
- Think I'd remember an
ugly loser like that.

01:13:26.735 --> 01:13:30.204
Kind of like I won't
forget your face.

01:13:30.205 --> 01:13:31.606
- Lemme see that picture.

01:13:31.607 --> 01:13:33.307
- Now, Carl, I think it's that.

01:13:33.308 --> 01:13:35.810
- I'm an officer, I
was on the force here

01:13:35.811 --> 01:13:38.246
and I can, maybe I
can help y'all.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.414
Yeah I know him.

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:40.581
- Where can we find him?

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:43.518
- Well, you're feds, huh?

01:13:43.519 --> 01:13:44.987
- Yes, sir.

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:48.022
- You swear or affirm
to tell the truth,

01:13:48.023 --> 01:13:51.026
the whole truth, and nothin' but
the truth, so help you God?

01:13:52.628 --> 01:13:53.961
- Yeah.

01:13:53.962 --> 01:13:55.063
- Roy.

01:13:57.299 --> 01:13:59.867
Would you say that your brother,

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:01.936
the defendant,

01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:03.639
has a problem with girls?

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:05.840
- No.

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:08.009
Except he never has any.

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:11.312
- Did he have a thing

01:14:11.313 --> 01:14:13.247
for Allison Blevins?

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:14.449
- Probably so.

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:16.250
He liked her a lot.

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:18.686
- As a girlfriend.

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:20.255
- That was his hope.

01:14:21.723 --> 01:14:24.258
- But wasn't she
goin' out with you?

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:25.594
- Yeah.

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:29.097
Yeah, she was homecomin'
queen, I was her escort.

01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:33.701
- And didn't Allison disappear

01:14:33.702 --> 01:14:38.339
that very night that
Tiger first discovered

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.909
that you were the one
that she actually liked?

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:45.980
- Yeah, but you see,

01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:49.917
Tiger, he doesn't always
understand these things.

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:51.078
- Because of his limitations.

01:14:51.102 --> 01:14:52.253
- Objection, your honor.

01:14:52.254 --> 01:14:54.956
The witness is not
a psychologist.

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:56.425
- Sustained.

01:14:57.459 --> 01:15:01.028
- Now you've seen the evidence
against your brother.

01:15:01.029 --> 01:15:02.797
- Yes, sir.

01:15:02.798 --> 01:15:06.334
- But the defense claims that
Tiger's limitations mean

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:09.036
he couldn't have harmed
Allison Blevins.

01:15:09.037 --> 01:15:10.197
What do you think about that?

01:15:10.198 --> 01:15:11.498
- Once, once again, your honor,

01:15:11.499 --> 01:15:13.674
the witness is not
a psychologist.

01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:15.844
- Sustained, stick to the facts.

01:15:16.879 --> 01:15:21.816
- Have you ever seen
your brother get angry

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:23.285
and hurt somebody?

01:15:26.154 --> 01:15:27.155
- Yeah.

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:32.527
I mean, there was this one time.

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:33.995
This guy tried to
run over his dog

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:36.964
and Tiger, Tiger 'bout
exploded on him.

01:15:36.965 --> 01:15:38.132
- He was tryin' kill Buddy.

01:15:38.133 --> 01:15:40.801
- Quiet please, Mr. Mitchell.

01:15:40.802 --> 01:15:42.537
- Did he hurt the man?

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:44.672
- No, I pulled him off the guy.

01:15:44.673 --> 01:15:47.008
- So you're sayin' that
when Tiger gets upset

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:50.745
over somethin' or somebody
that he cares a lot about,

01:15:50.746 --> 01:15:52.013
he can act out?

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:54.615
- That is pure
speculation, your honor.

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:55.950
- I'll allow it.

01:15:55.951 --> 01:15:57.752
The witness has been
able to observe

01:15:57.753 --> 01:15:59.787
the behavior of the defendant.

01:15:59.788 --> 01:16:02.323
- And when Carl Blevins
came to your door,

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:04.191
did Tiger act out then?

01:16:04.192 --> 01:16:06.272
- No, he didn't act out, he
was tryin' to protect me.

01:16:06.296 --> 01:16:08.029
Carl Blevins attacked me.

01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:10.665
- And wouldn't you say

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:12.733
that if,

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:15.770
if Allison wouldn't return
his expressions of love?

01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:17.004
- I didn't say that, I didn't.

01:16:17.005 --> 01:16:18.439
- Well let's be honest here.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.008
If Allison had a choice to make
between somebody like you,

01:16:21.009 --> 01:16:23.678
a football star, good-lookin',

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:25.680
a man with a future,

01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:29.483
and Tiger, a man-child
with no skills,

01:16:29.484 --> 01:16:30.953
what's she gonna do?

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:34.722
She's gonna have to tell the man

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:36.524
who's obsessed with her,

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:39.727
who drives by her
house every night,

01:16:39.728 --> 01:16:41.629
who

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:44.799
dreams one day she
will love him,

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.902
she's gonna have to tell him no.

01:16:47.903 --> 01:16:49.236
And when she rejects Tiger,

01:16:49.237 --> 01:16:51.105
can you imagine the anger,

01:16:51.106 --> 01:16:54.675
after years of total
frustration and rejection.

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:55.810
- Objection!

01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:57.979
Who the hell is testifying here?

01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:59.947
- Get to your question, Mr.
Huntley.

01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:02.617
- My point is, is doesn't
take a mental giant

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.151
to do somebody harm,
now does it, Roy?

01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:05.386
- Objection, your honor!

01:17:05.387 --> 01:17:06.587
- I don't know.

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:07.389
- Includin' murder.
- Objection,

01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:09.390
your honor, objection!

01:17:09.391 --> 01:17:11.058
- Sustained.

01:17:11.059 --> 01:17:12.693
- That's all.

01:17:12.694 --> 01:17:15.096
- Your witness, Mr. Franklin.

01:17:15.097 --> 01:17:16.565
- Roy.

01:17:18.266 --> 01:17:21.369
Isn't it true Allison
left the, the party early

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:23.137
because she was upset with you?

01:17:23.138 --> 01:17:25.172
- Yeah, well, that's
how women are.

01:17:25.173 --> 01:17:27.476
They lack control
over their emotions.

01:17:29.711 --> 01:17:33.247
- Wasn't she upset because
you were so drunk

01:17:33.248 --> 01:17:35.082
and you were forcing
yourself on her?

01:17:35.083 --> 01:17:36.283
Isn't that right?

01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:37.804
Roy, we already got
all the testimonies

01:17:37.828 --> 01:17:40.187
from everybody
else at the party.

01:17:40.188 --> 01:17:42.289
- Yeah, okay, maybe I'd
been drinkin' a little.

01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:44.526
Doesn't mean I was gonna
hurt her or anything.

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:48.663
- That was it?

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:49.830
She just went home?

01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:51.366
- Yeah, pretty much.

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:54.969
- Isn't it true, Roy,

01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:56.804
that you went over
to Allison's house

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:57.872
after the party?

01:17:57.873 --> 01:18:00.008
- Where you gettin' that from?

01:18:02.611 --> 01:18:03.978
- You're under oath, son.

01:18:03.979 --> 01:18:06.113
You lie on this stand,

01:18:06.114 --> 01:18:08.949
you might be seeing jail time.

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:12.054
And all those scholarships
will be gone.

01:18:13.922 --> 01:18:16.023
- Allison!

01:18:16.024 --> 01:18:17.692
Hey, Allison, open the door!

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:18.959
- Crazy son of a bitch.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.428
- Allison, just open the door.

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:22.530
I just wanna talk to ya!

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:24.231
Just wanna tell ya
that you're pretty,

01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:25.866
so open the door.

01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:31.639
So open the door!

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.376
Allison, open the door.

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:38.246
Allison, come on!

01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:44.685
- So I'm gonna ask
you one more time.

01:18:44.686 --> 01:18:47.288
Did you go to Allison
Blevins house

01:18:47.289 --> 01:18:48.723
after the party?

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:50.157
- Yeah, okay, maybe I did,

01:18:50.158 --> 01:18:52.793
but I just wanted to
see how she was doin'.

01:18:52.794 --> 01:18:55.162
- And how was she doin', Roy?

01:18:55.163 --> 01:18:56.923
- I don't know, she
wouldn't answer the door.

01:18:56.924 --> 01:18:59.158
- Why, because she was afraid
what you might do to her?

01:18:59.159 --> 01:19:01.036
- Objection, speculation.

01:19:10.245 --> 01:19:12.113
- You were upset, Roy,

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:15.049
because she turned you down.

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:17.351
And nobody turns
down Roy Mitchell.

01:19:17.352 --> 01:19:19.286
Objection, your honor.

01:19:19.287 --> 01:19:21.056
- Sustained.

01:19:22.624 --> 01:19:23.959
- Nothing further.

01:19:25.026 --> 01:19:26.361
- Step down, sir.

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:39.040
Your witness, Mr. Franklin.

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:43.677
- Sheriff, how long have
you known the defendant?

01:19:43.678 --> 01:19:45.046
- His whole life.

01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:48.582
- Did you ever have any concerns

01:19:48.583 --> 01:19:50.684
that he might be a threat

01:19:50.685 --> 01:19:52.887
to your community?

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:54.255
- A threat, no.

01:19:54.256 --> 01:19:56.690
Concerns that he might
burn somethin' down

01:19:56.691 --> 01:19:58.325
with a Roman candle that you buy

01:19:58.326 --> 01:20:01.128
out of the back of
his truck, yeah.

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:03.531
Tiger's always been a
good 'un in my book.

01:20:03.532 --> 01:20:06.100
I mean, it's not his fault he
don't play with a full deck.

01:20:06.101 --> 01:20:07.535
- A full deck.

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:09.069
You mean his disability?

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:10.905
- I don't know if I'd
call it a disability.

01:20:10.906 --> 01:20:12.740
He's a capable enough fella.

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:14.441
He's just slow, that's all.

01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:16.877
- He's just slow, that's all?
- Yes, sir.

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:19.614
- Sheriff, his being slow.

01:20:21.883 --> 01:20:23.584
Is he any different than you?

01:20:23.585 --> 01:20:24.685
- Well yeah.

01:20:24.686 --> 01:20:27.054
Absolutely, I'm not slow.

01:20:27.055 --> 01:20:28.122
And he's simple-minded.

01:20:28.123 --> 01:20:29.323
He doesn't have the same sense

01:20:29.347 --> 01:20:31.091
of right and wrong that we do.

01:20:31.092 --> 01:20:34.628
He's like a really
tall 10 year old boy.

01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:35.730
- Okay.

01:20:37.065 --> 01:20:38.732
Is it possible, Sheriff,

01:20:38.733 --> 01:20:41.836
on the night of September 5th,

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:44.072
that when Tiger was looking
through Allison's window...

01:20:49.911 --> 01:20:52.346
He walked around the
back to the garage

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:54.348
where she was clearing boxes

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:56.251
and just simply
offered to help her?

01:20:58.186 --> 01:20:59.220
- Oh my God.

01:20:59.221 --> 01:21:00.454
- Hi, Allison.

01:21:00.455 --> 01:21:02.089
- Tiger, what are
you doin' here?

01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:05.259
- I, I like to drive by
your house sometime.

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:06.261
- Oh.

01:21:10.233 --> 01:21:11.233
For me?

01:21:11.234 --> 01:21:12.834
- Mm hmm.

01:21:14.469 --> 01:21:16.670
- Well thank ya, Tiger.

01:21:16.671 --> 01:21:19.540
- I, I'm sorry, I, I didn't, I
didn't mean to make you cry.

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:21.041
- Oh no, Tiger.
- I was just.

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:23.377
- Tiger, I'm not cryin', it's
just allergies with the dust

01:21:23.378 --> 01:21:24.578
and everything.

01:21:24.579 --> 01:21:26.179
I have to take these
bottles to the dump.

01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:27.781
- I'll get them boxes
for you, here, see.

01:21:27.782 --> 01:21:29.083
- Oh no, it's really heavy.

01:21:29.084 --> 01:21:30.751
Tiger, it's really heavy.
- It's okay.

01:21:30.752 --> 01:21:32.453
- You're strong but, Tiger.
- I am.

01:21:32.454 --> 01:21:33.954
- I have to take
'em to the dump.

01:21:33.955 --> 01:21:35.155
I can't.

01:21:35.156 --> 01:21:36.876
- It's okay, I, I gotta
go to the dump, too.

01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:38.993
I got lots of trash.

01:21:38.994 --> 01:21:40.561
- Okay.
- Mm hmm.

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:42.597
- Oh, well, one
more then, Tiger.

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:46.033
- Is that possible?

01:21:46.034 --> 01:21:49.237
- All right, I, I guess so.

01:21:50.505 --> 01:21:52.873
- Oh that, that's gonna have
to go upfront with Buddy

01:21:52.874 --> 01:21:54.675
'cause it's all full back here.

01:21:54.676 --> 01:21:55.843
- Okay.

01:21:55.844 --> 01:21:57.344
- But it doesn't
explain how he got

01:21:57.345 --> 01:22:00.581
his semen on her bloody clothes.

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:02.650
- Buddy.

01:22:02.651 --> 01:22:04.518
Buddy, it, it, it's Allison.

01:22:04.519 --> 01:22:06.420
- If she cut her own
hand on a broken,

01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:09.156
broken beer bottle,

01:22:09.157 --> 01:22:11.358
she could've got blood
on herself, right?

01:22:11.359 --> 01:22:12.459
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:14.128
- Bye, Allison.
- Bye.

01:22:14.129 --> 01:22:15.596
- She would've thrown,

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:17.665
she would've thrown
those clothes away.

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:20.101
- Bye.

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:32.980
- So when Tiger took out
all Allison's trash,

01:22:32.981 --> 01:22:35.416
those clothes would've
ended up in his truck.

01:22:35.417 --> 01:22:38.319
Well maybe, maybe Tiger

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.080
couldn't find anything
else to clean up with,

01:22:40.104 --> 01:22:43.357
so he used Allison's discarded
t-shirt and shorts.

01:22:43.358 --> 01:22:46.694
There is no body,

01:22:46.695 --> 01:22:49.930
no evidence of a struggle.

01:22:49.931 --> 01:22:52.467
No proof of a crime
even committed.

01:22:53.835 --> 01:22:55.537
Just a boy with an
innocent crush.

01:22:59.381 --> 01:23:00.941
- That's some theory
you got goin' there

01:23:00.942 --> 01:23:02.109
but what you're forgettin' is

01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:03.577
we have a signed confession.

01:23:03.578 --> 01:23:04.446
He confessed...

01:23:04.447 --> 01:23:06.113
- You mean a confession

01:23:06.114 --> 01:23:09.216
that you obtained
with your deputy

01:23:09.217 --> 01:23:10.985
without an attorney present?

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:12.786
That confession?

01:23:12.787 --> 01:23:14.756
- I don't, I just want my dog.

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:18.058
Please.

01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:19.427
- It's locked.

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:24.865
Come on. - No!

01:23:24.866 --> 01:23:26.234
- Come on, Tiger.

01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:30.605
There's nobody that's
comin' here, Tiger.

01:23:33.508 --> 01:23:37.379
You went over to Allison's
that night, didn't ya?

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:41.316
She was upset.

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:44.118
You just wanted to make her
feel better, huh, Tiger?

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:45.119
- I did.

01:23:48.323 --> 01:23:49.958
- You wanted to kiss
her, didn't you?

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:54.963
You didn't mean to
hurt her, Tiger.

01:23:57.766 --> 01:23:58.900
But you did.

01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:09.411
- Nothing further.

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:30.130
- The court recognizes Mr.
Reggie Huntley

01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:32.934
to make his closing argument
on behalf of the state.

01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:38.406
- I know it's hard to accept.

01:24:40.308 --> 01:24:42.342
But we all know

01:24:42.343 --> 01:24:43.778
it is the painful truth.

01:24:46.114 --> 01:24:48.183
Sometimes people
live double lives.

01:24:49.284 --> 01:24:50.751
A pleasant,

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:53.587
even kind-hearted young man,

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:55.656
nice,

01:24:55.657 --> 01:24:59.259
well-intentioned on the outside,

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:02.362
a lovable friend of
this, this little town.

01:25:02.363 --> 01:25:04.231
But then,

01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:06.400
inside,

01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:09.703
deep inside there are hidden,

01:25:09.704 --> 01:25:11.805
frightenin',

01:25:11.806 --> 01:25:15.175
ungovernable urges that

01:25:15.176 --> 01:25:17.077
we never really knew about.

01:25:17.078 --> 01:25:19.847
Desperate, savage
feelin's that sometimes

01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:21.049
just erupt.

01:25:23.585 --> 01:25:25.220
And then it's too late.

01:25:26.187 --> 01:25:29.656
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tiger Mitchell

01:25:29.657 --> 01:25:32.493
had a secret life

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:35.963
fueled by sexual urges.

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:39.366
He is not the innocent
man-child he appears to be.

01:25:39.367 --> 01:25:41.535
And now it's time
to tell the truth.

01:25:41.536 --> 01:25:46.106
When you convict Mr. Mitchell

01:25:46.107 --> 01:25:49.209
for murderin' Allison Blevins,

01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:53.013
you will send a crucial,
necessary message

01:25:53.014 --> 01:25:57.084
that all lies must be revealed

01:25:57.085 --> 01:26:02.055
and that truth,
even painful ones,

01:26:02.056 --> 01:26:03.625
must prevail.

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:14.768
- Mr. Franklin, you may
make your closing argument

01:26:14.769 --> 01:26:16.237
on behalf of the defendant.

01:26:24.245 --> 01:26:25.513
- Fate.

01:26:26.881 --> 01:26:29.184
Fate brought me here
to this little town.

01:26:31.152 --> 01:26:34.621
Then I got to know the
fine people of Juniper.

01:26:34.622 --> 01:26:38.158
And they accepted me
for, for who I am.

01:26:38.159 --> 01:26:39.526
But there's been only one person

01:26:39.527 --> 01:26:41.262
who's affected me more
than any of them.

01:26:43.364 --> 01:26:44.599
That's Tiger Mitchell.

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:49.002
Tiger Mitchell is
everything good and true

01:26:49.003 --> 01:26:50.737
you celebrate.

01:26:50.738 --> 01:26:54.107
Rare enough to find
it in yourself.

01:26:54.108 --> 01:26:58.779
That's why the very idea,

01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:03.184
the very idea of him causing
the death of Allison Blevins.

01:27:07.021 --> 01:27:08.256
It's just not possible.

01:27:11.559 --> 01:27:13.061
It's not possible.

01:27:14.829 --> 01:27:18.432
So he was frustrated that
he couldn't get a girl.

01:27:18.433 --> 01:27:20.167
But to think that
his frustration

01:27:20.168 --> 01:27:23.437
would lead him to,

01:27:23.438 --> 01:27:24.438
to kill?

01:27:25.506 --> 01:27:26.975
To kill someone?

01:27:28.543 --> 01:27:31.645
You ask anyone who knows Tiger.

01:27:31.646 --> 01:27:36.116
Tiger was threatened,

01:27:36.117 --> 01:27:39.920
manipulated, and harassed

01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:42.156
to confess to something
that he never did.

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:44.359
That's the real crime.

01:27:47.395 --> 01:27:51.699
Tiger Mitchell is a
good-hearted, loyal kid.

01:27:53.935 --> 01:27:57.604
Much more deserving in life
than what he's been given.

01:27:57.605 --> 01:28:01.308
And with this lack of evidence,

01:28:01.309 --> 01:28:02.777
we're gonna take
that away from him?

01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:07.080
So are we really gonna
put a young man

01:28:07.081 --> 01:28:10.784
behind bars for a crime
that we don't even know

01:28:10.785 --> 01:28:12.553
has even been committed?

01:28:14.522 --> 01:28:15.523
Why?

01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:19.794
Why, because he's not like us?

01:28:32.473 --> 01:28:35.143
As God as my witness,
I know in my heart...

01:28:38.913 --> 01:28:41.915
that Tiger Mitchell

01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:43.384
is an innocent man.

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:02.703
- Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

01:29:02.704 --> 01:29:06.373
have you selected a foreperson
from among your number?

01:29:06.374 --> 01:29:08.642
- We have, your honor.

01:29:08.643 --> 01:29:10.811
- And have you
reached a verdict?

01:29:10.812 --> 01:29:12.179
- Yes we have, your honor.

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.315
- Would the defendant
please rise?

01:29:18.986 --> 01:29:21.289
Mr. Foreman, please
publish the verdict.

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:26.226
- In the case of the state of
Texas versus Tiger Mitchell

01:29:26.227 --> 01:29:27.961
on the charge of murder,

01:29:27.962 --> 01:29:30.832
we the jury find the
defendant not guilty.

01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:37.238
- Tiger.

01:29:39.474 --> 01:29:41.142
- I, I'm not guilty, Roy.

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.014
I'm not guilty.

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:49.817
- That's my boy.

01:29:53.654 --> 01:29:55.222
- We did it.

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:56.823
- You're, you're my
second-best buddy,

01:29:56.824 --> 01:29:58.759
next to Buddy of course.

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.994
- Of course, Tiger.

01:30:00.995 --> 01:30:02.397
- I knew it.

01:30:40.435 --> 01:30:43.471
- Travelin' kinda light
aren't ya, Peter?

01:30:44.539 --> 01:30:47.707
- Oh, yeah.

01:30:47.708 --> 01:30:49.410
Just a little dirty laundry.

01:30:54.582 --> 01:30:55.582
- Get over here.

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:57.051
- Okay.

01:30:58.419 --> 01:31:01.988
- I have some dirty laundry
to take care of as well.

01:31:01.989 --> 01:31:04.625
- Come on, guys, don't ya have
anything better to do, huh?

01:31:05.726 --> 01:31:06.726
- No.

01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:11.131
Do you remember when you

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:14.100
said to our employer,

01:31:14.101 --> 01:31:15.368
what was that?

01:31:15.369 --> 01:31:16.603
- "I don't make mistakes."

01:31:16.604 --> 01:31:18.271
- That.

01:31:18.272 --> 01:31:20.174
- Well you can't win
'em all, right?

01:31:22.343 --> 01:31:24.545
- Yeah, well tell that to Sonny.

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:28.850
- Miss Smith sends her regards.

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:40.194
What a shithole.

01:31:48.469 --> 01:31:52.006
Say goodbye to
God-forsaken Texas.

01:31:55.943 --> 01:31:57.278
- I got him.

01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:01.482
- You want him,
come and get him.

01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:05.051
I could take out half
these rednecks myself.

01:32:05.052 --> 01:32:07.588
I got the other half.

01:32:08.823 --> 01:32:10.757
- That's what you get
for messin' with Texas!

01:32:10.758 --> 01:32:12.092
- Good shot, Roy.

01:32:12.093 --> 01:32:13.360
- Damn straight.

01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:15.862
- Anybody else want some
of this redneck action?

01:32:15.863 --> 01:32:17.864
Might wanna put those
little pea-shooters down.

01:32:17.865 --> 01:32:19.165
- You set us up.

01:32:19.166 --> 01:32:21.035
- Y'all stepped right into it.

01:32:22.537 --> 01:32:23.904
- Here's what's gonna happen.

01:32:23.905 --> 01:32:26.806
You're gonna put that
firearm down on the ground.

01:32:26.807 --> 01:32:28.241
Put it down or I'm gonna put one

01:32:28.242 --> 01:32:29.809
between your goddamn eyes.

01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:30.810
Now!

01:32:33.814 --> 01:32:35.615
Now you get in your fancy car

01:32:35.616 --> 01:32:37.017
and you better drive west

01:32:37.018 --> 01:32:38.258
and you get the hell outta here

01:32:38.282 --> 01:32:40.287
before I put a boot
in your ass so far

01:32:40.288 --> 01:32:41.454
you gonna taste leather.

01:32:41.455 --> 01:32:43.123
- Don't, don't mess with Mr.
Frank.

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:44.926
He, he's my buddy.

01:32:53.367 --> 01:32:54.527
- We're not through with you.

01:32:54.551 --> 01:32:55.835
- You heard him.

01:32:55.836 --> 01:32:57.405
Now get the hell outta here.

01:33:10.351 --> 01:33:13.053
- Those are bad men, Mr. Frank.

01:33:13.054 --> 01:33:14.354
- Yes they are, Tiger.

01:33:14.355 --> 01:33:17.190
- Sometimes you're the moose.

01:33:17.191 --> 01:33:20.193
- Sometimes you're the mailbox.

01:33:20.194 --> 01:33:22.796
- I tell ya what, let's
all go down to Stid's.

01:33:22.797 --> 01:33:24.331
Drinks are on the house.

01:33:24.332 --> 01:33:25.532
- I heard that.

01:33:25.533 --> 01:33:27.601
- I don't know how
to thank you guys.

01:33:27.602 --> 01:33:29.336
You guys saved my life.

01:33:29.337 --> 01:33:32.907
- Well, us rednecks gotta
stick together, right?

01:33:36.577 --> 01:33:39.679
- Just another day
in Juniper, huh?

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:42.248
I guess I might
actually write a novel.

01:33:42.249 --> 01:33:43.517
- You should.

01:34:16.384 --> 01:34:20.253
- I, I don't want you to go, Mr.
Peter.

01:34:20.254 --> 01:34:21.555
- I know, Tiger.

01:34:23.190 --> 01:34:26.192
But those mean guys,
they might come back.

01:34:26.193 --> 01:34:29.596
I don't want anybody
gettin' hurt.

01:34:29.597 --> 01:34:31.498
- Where you headed?

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:33.266
- I'm not sure yet.

01:34:33.267 --> 01:34:35.135
I was thinkin' start,
start headin' west

01:34:35.136 --> 01:34:36.776
and see where the road
takes me, you know?

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:38.538
- You take good
care of yourself.

01:34:38.539 --> 01:34:41.741
I'll be prayin'
real hard for ya.

01:34:41.742 --> 01:34:43.376
- Nana, thank you.

01:34:43.377 --> 01:34:45.413
- Thank you for takin'
care of my boys.

01:34:53.487 --> 01:34:54.822
- I'm gonna miss you, Tiger.

01:34:57.625 --> 01:34:59.060
You take care of yourself.

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:05.565
You hold on to it like a tiger.

01:35:05.566 --> 01:35:08.034
- You, you gonna come
visit me sometime?

01:35:08.035 --> 01:35:09.570
- Stranger things have happened.

01:35:13.207 --> 01:35:14.741
Take care of your bro.

01:35:14.742 --> 01:35:16.143
- You can count on it.

01:35:21.582 --> 01:35:22.582
- Here.

01:35:28.989 --> 01:35:30.357
It looks good on you.

01:35:31.292 --> 01:35:32.593
Ain't that right, Buddy?

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:40.167
- I'll see you, Buddy.

01:35:51.645 --> 01:35:53.279
- Hey, Tiger, how ya doin'?

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:54.781
- Hey, Mr. Joe Ralph.

01:35:54.782 --> 01:35:56.182
- How's Buddy?

01:35:56.183 --> 01:35:58.619
- Oh, he's, he's my best buddy.

01:36:03.791 --> 01:36:06.760
- Lanny, look at
that, we did it.

01:36:06.761 --> 01:36:08.228
- Congratulations, baby.

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:09.796
- So proud of us.

01:36:09.797 --> 01:36:11.998
- I can't wait to eat your pie.

01:36:11.999 --> 01:36:13.534
- Lanny!

01:36:24.512 --> 01:36:26.881
- Allison said she had
never seen the ocean.

01:36:27.948 --> 01:36:30.150
And that's when I realized

01:36:30.151 --> 01:36:33.319
that maybe I took
things for granted.

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:35.000
I don't know if they'll
ever find her body.

01:36:36.056 --> 01:36:37.591
Who knows if they'll
ever find mine.

01:36:38.859 --> 01:36:41.395
It's only a matter of time
before I gotta pay the piper.

01:36:42.596 --> 01:36:44.198
Miss Smith will never give up.

01:36:46.267 --> 01:36:47.735
I'll never see Elaine again.

01:36:49.170 --> 01:36:50.805
Now I sleep with one eye open.

01:36:52.072 --> 01:36:53.741
At least I got to see
the ocean again.

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:07.320
- Hey.

01:37:08.656 --> 01:37:10.423
Where's your bathing suit?

01:37:10.424 --> 01:37:11.691
- Left it in Texas.

01:37:11.692 --> 01:37:14.494
- That's a very sad story.

01:37:14.495 --> 01:37:16.696
- Ladies.

01:37:16.697 --> 01:37:19.065
- Thank you.

01:37:19.066 --> 01:37:22.135
- Oh hey, you again.

01:37:22.136 --> 01:37:24.938
You must enjoy the scenery.

01:37:24.939 --> 01:37:26.606
- It's beautiful.

01:37:26.607 --> 01:37:28.842
- Can I get you anything.

01:37:28.843 --> 01:37:30.977
- No, I'm good right
now, thank you.

01:37:30.978 --> 01:37:32.313
- You're welcome.

01:37:34.014 --> 01:37:36.416
- You look like a speedos man.

01:37:36.417 --> 01:37:39.752
- Would you give it
a rest, Rose, jeez.

01:37:39.753 --> 01:37:40.721
- Do I?

01:37:40.722 --> 01:37:42.223
- Mm hmm.

01:37:45.993 --> 01:37:47.353
- Can I get you
guys anything else?

01:37:47.377 --> 01:37:49.295
- Oh we're good, we are good.

01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:51.464
We're just enjoying the view.

01:37:51.465 --> 01:37:54.100
- Oh, that's why I work here.

01:37:54.101 --> 01:37:55.535
- Hey, your accent.

01:37:55.536 --> 01:37:56.769
Where's it from?

01:37:56.770 --> 01:37:59.272
- Oh, you guys don't wanna know.

01:37:59.273 --> 01:38:00.907
- No, it's cute,
where's it from?

01:38:00.908 --> 01:38:04.344
- Um, this little
piss-ant town in Texas.

01:38:04.345 --> 01:38:05.865
Yeah, let me know if
you need anything.

01:38:05.889 --> 01:38:06.580
- Thank you.

01:38:06.581 --> 01:38:08.082
- Oh, excuse me.

01:38:09.617 --> 01:38:10.717
Allison?

01:38:10.718 --> 01:38:11.851
- Oh my God.

01:38:11.852 --> 01:38:13.554
Mr. Frank, what are
you doing here?

01:38:14.788 --> 01:38:17.857
I mean, I, I never thought
that they would pin it

01:38:17.858 --> 01:38:19.893
on anyone, I mean
let alone Tiger.

01:38:19.894 --> 01:38:21.494
I feel horrible.

01:38:21.495 --> 01:38:22.795
- He's okay.

01:38:22.796 --> 01:38:24.063
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:38:24.064 --> 01:38:25.384
- Are you sure the
case is closed?

01:38:25.408 --> 01:38:26.799
He's fine, he's not
goin' to jail?

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:29.469
- I got him off, thank God.

01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:30.937
- Yeah.

01:38:30.938 --> 01:38:33.873
- Listen, I'll let everybody
in Juniper know you're okay.

01:38:33.874 --> 01:38:34.775
That you're alive.

01:38:34.776 --> 01:38:36.477
But you have to do me a favor.

01:38:38.279 --> 01:38:40.680
Let your dad know
that you're okay.

01:38:40.681 --> 01:38:43.917
He was worried sick, he
was torn up from it.

01:38:43.918 --> 01:38:45.551
- I couldn't end up like my mom.

01:38:45.552 --> 01:38:48.087
- You won't, you didn't.

01:38:48.088 --> 01:38:49.289
You're here.

01:38:49.290 --> 01:38:51.525
Just do that for me, okay?

01:38:58.265 --> 01:39:00.234
- Is this enough for your book?

01:39:03.037 --> 01:39:04.238
- I'm still a lawyer.

01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:07.408
Except I'm not
chasin' the money.

01:39:09.677 --> 01:39:11.245
I learned a lot from Tiger.

01:39:12.913 --> 01:39:15.214
- Amber, could you come help
me for a second please?

01:39:15.215 --> 01:39:17.417
- Yeah, yeah, I'll
be right there.

01:39:17.418 --> 01:39:18.952
- Amber now?

01:39:18.953 --> 01:39:19.953
- Yep.

01:39:20.921 --> 01:39:22.388
- I like it.

01:39:22.389 --> 01:39:23.856
- What's yours?

01:39:23.857 --> 01:39:24.857
- Mine?

01:39:27.194 --> 01:39:28.194
Buddy.

01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:30.530
Buddy Mitchell.

01:39:30.531 --> 01:39:31.798
- Really?

01:39:31.799 --> 01:39:33.300
- Yeah, why?

01:39:34.301 --> 01:39:36.836
I think it fits the situation.

01:39:36.837 --> 01:39:38.104
- Okay.

01:39:38.105 --> 01:39:39.872
- So Malibu, huh?

01:39:39.873 --> 01:39:42.408
- Hey, you sold me on it.

01:39:42.409 --> 01:39:43.410
- I did.

01:39:44.645 --> 01:39:46.513
- Cheers to Malibu.

01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:49.650
- To Malibu.
