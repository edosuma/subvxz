09:41.015 --> 09:42.973
I fully support him.
He's my best friend.

09:43.017 --> 09:45.628
But you just said
that the Grindr story was

09:45.672 --> 09:46.760
a load of bull.

09:46.803 --> 09:47.978
He would never do
a random hook up.

09:48.022 --> 09:49.676
He's been in a relationship
for a year.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.288
Oh, okay.

09:53.331 --> 09:55.507
May we ask with who?

09:55.551 --> 09:58.554
Phil Diaz,
his physical therapist.

09:59.686 --> 10:02.079
He's in the chapel
praying for Tommy.

10:02.123 --> 10:06.954
<i>♪</i>

10:06.997 --> 10:10.261
I'm not religious, but I need
to be near God right now.

10:12.263 --> 10:13.525
Is Tommy gonna pull through?

10:13.569 --> 10:16.311
We certainly hope so.

10:16.354 --> 10:18.182
Chrissy told you
about me and Tommy?

10:18.226 --> 10:19.836
Yeah.
How long have you known him?

10:19.880 --> 10:22.186
We started working together
after his injury.

10:22.230 --> 10:25.320
He had a complete dislocation
of the right shoulder.

10:25.363 --> 10:27.627
The bone was literally
ripped out of the socket.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.803
Is that when you two
got close?

10:30.847 --> 10:32.675
We talked a lot
in our sessions.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.024
Got to some truths.

10:34.068 --> 10:35.939
It was kind of
a miraculous process.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.855
We fell in love.

10:38.899 --> 10:42.293
Does anyone besides Chrissy
know about you and him?

10:42.337 --> 10:43.817
Not many.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.209
But after tonight,

10:45.253 --> 10:47.037
the whole world is
gonna find out.

10:47.081 --> 10:48.256
How so?

10:48.299 --> 10:51.041
Tommy was in great shape.
Unbeatable.

10:51.085 --> 10:54.610
After his win, he was gonna
come out as a gay man.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.742
Right there in the ring.

10:55.785 --> 10:58.396
Okay, how many people
knew about that?

10:58.440 --> 11:01.486
Chrissy, me, Jax Bell.

11:01.530 --> 11:04.141
The former champ,
now commissioner

11:04.185 --> 11:05.882
and co-owner of FWO.

11:05.926 --> 11:07.710
Right.
And what was his take on that?

11:07.754 --> 11:09.407
I couldn't tell you.

11:09.451 --> 11:12.976
And Jax, he'll charm
the trunks right off of you.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.718
But no one ever knows
what he's really thinking.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.589
Captain, Fin's got something.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.679
Okay. Um, I'll go.

11:23.639 --> 11:26.642
- Hey.
- TARU tossed Tommy's phone.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.078
That Grindr account?

11:28.122 --> 11:30.646
It was just activated
yesterday.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.735
Looks like somebody
tried to kill Tommy

11:32.779 --> 11:34.389
then make it look like
a hook-up gone wrong.

11:34.432 --> 11:36.783
He was planning
on outing himself tonight.

11:36.826 --> 11:38.436
After the fight.

11:38.480 --> 11:41.309
So whoever this was didn't want
him getting in that ring

11:41.352 --> 11:43.790
Or coming out afterwards.

11:49.926 --> 11:51.711
You can't just
shut me out like this.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.016
Katie, don't hang up--

11:53.060 --> 11:54.496
Katie.

11:54.539 --> 11:55.932
[knocks on door]
Chief.

11:55.976 --> 11:57.368
Hey, you wanted to see me?

11:57.412 --> 11:58.805
Yeah. Come on in.

12:00.154 --> 12:01.198
I assume you've seen this?

12:01.242 --> 12:02.765
- I have.
- And where are we?

12:02.809 --> 12:05.376
Well,
the Grindr date was staged.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.813
Yeah,
I coulda told you that.

12:09.206 --> 12:10.512
Sorry.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.166
Sorry, it's been a long week.

12:14.385 --> 12:15.909
What's going on?

12:15.952 --> 12:19.042
Raising teenaged daughters?
Tougher than this job.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.740
And the middle one? Jesus.

12:20.783 --> 12:24.308
Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm lucky
my son's still in grade school.

12:24.352 --> 12:25.745
You know
my wife and I on Thursday

12:25.788 --> 12:28.399
waited up till 2:30
in the morning?

12:28.443 --> 12:31.315
[scoffs] You know what we see.
The animals out there.

12:31.359 --> 12:32.795
I was scared to death.

12:32.839 --> 12:35.102
I can imagine.

12:35.145 --> 12:37.844
And then she gets home,
and she's drunk.

12:37.887 --> 12:40.629
She's hammered, and she starts
mouthing off to me.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.892
I mean, if I--if I had spoken
to my father like that,

12:42.936 --> 12:44.241
I'd have been put in traction.

12:44.285 --> 12:46.200
I'm so sorry.

12:46.243 --> 12:47.723
Well, it was just
screaming and yelling.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.856
And then she locked herself
in her room

12:49.899 --> 12:51.074
and I shouldered the door open.

12:51.118 --> 12:53.729
Now my wife gets pissed off
at me.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.340
After 32 years of marriage,
I guess--

12:56.384 --> 12:59.169
I guess we're entitled
to a bad night or two, right?

12:59.213 --> 13:01.432
Look, if there's anything
that I can do...

13:01.476 --> 13:02.912
Nah, it's not your concern.

13:02.956 --> 13:06.524
Just close the case and get
this off my desk please.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.708
I guess we've all seen
the headlines.

13:16.752 --> 13:19.929
Including McGrath,
who is stressed.

13:19.973 --> 13:22.366
- Is everything okay with him?
- Something's going on.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.629
Okay, guys,
where are we on this case?

13:24.673 --> 13:26.501
Is there any update
on Tommy's condition?

13:26.544 --> 13:28.329
Tommy hasn't regained
consciousness.

13:28.372 --> 13:30.461
I spoke with Chrissy,
and she finally went home

13:30.505 --> 13:31.593
late last night
to get some sleep.

13:31.636 --> 13:33.377
So what do we know
about his life?

13:33.421 --> 13:35.336
Debts, financials?

13:35.379 --> 13:36.728
He hasn't fought
for the last year and a half.

13:36.772 --> 13:38.295
But for the last
couple of months,

13:38.339 --> 13:39.949
money's been going out
pretty fast.

13:39.993 --> 13:41.081
Credit card bills,

13:41.124 --> 13:42.952
retail therapy,
cash withdrawals.

13:42.996 --> 13:45.389
- Enough debt to throw a fight?
- He didn't need to.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.130
Last night was gonna be
a big payday.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.392
And I checked FanDuel

13:48.436 --> 13:49.306
and the other
online betting sights.

13:49.350 --> 13:50.655
There was no late money,

13:50.699 --> 13:52.179
like, big, last-minute swings
in the odds.

13:52.222 --> 13:54.485
And FW fighters
don't fix matches.

13:54.529 --> 13:55.878
They do it for honor.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.575
Kiki Alves was trying
to beat Tommy in the ring.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.969
Maybe. Okay, what about
forensics in the vehicle?

14:00.013 --> 14:02.363
Velasco, you said that there
were only traces of blood?

14:02.406 --> 14:03.755
Yes, CSU confirmed.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.453
There's just no way
that Tommy sustained

14:05.496 --> 14:06.758
the head injury in the truck.

14:06.802 --> 14:08.499
I mean, we're checking
traffic cams, but...

14:08.543 --> 14:10.850
Okay, so we don't have
a crime scene.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.591
In the meantime,
let's piece together

14:13.635 --> 14:15.506
a timeline of Tommy's day.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.508
Day of a big fight?
I'm sure he worked out.

14:17.552 --> 14:18.770
Let's start
at the training center.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.646
<i>We stand in solidarity</i>

14:24.689 --> 14:27.040
<i>with our brother warrior</i> <i>
Tommy Baker</i>

14:27.083 --> 14:32.001
<i>and condemn this vicious</i> <i>
and biased attack.</i>

14:32.045 --> 14:34.699
<i>Tommy's in the fight</i> <i>
of his life right now.</i>

14:34.743 --> 14:37.920
<i>He needs our prayers</i> <i>
and support.</i>

14:37.964 --> 14:39.966
<i>Not our judgement.</i>

14:40.009 --> 14:44.187
<i>And we hope these perpetrators</i> <i>
will face a swift</i>

14:44.231 --> 14:45.928
<i>and merciless punishment.</i>

14:45.972 --> 14:47.712
Where do we start?

14:47.756 --> 14:48.844
Ricky Nowak.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.150
He and Tommy
are in the same stable.

14:50.193 --> 14:51.368
They train together.

14:51.412 --> 14:54.154
He was an up-and-comer
for a minute.

14:54.197 --> 14:56.852
Tommy was like a hero to me.
I'm sick about this.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.636
Any idea
who could have done this?

14:58.680 --> 15:00.421
Everybody loves that guy.

15:00.464 --> 15:02.510
So you saw Tommy Friday
morning when you came in?

15:02.553 --> 15:04.207
You guys worked out?

15:04.251 --> 15:05.992
He just wanted
to talk to Jax.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.558
Do you know about what?

15:09.125 --> 15:11.954
This might cost me with Jax,
but whatever it was,

15:11.998 --> 15:13.216
Jax was pissed.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.609
I could hear them
yelling at each other.

15:14.652 --> 15:16.393
Tommy came out of the office
real shaken up.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.395
Okay, and did Tommy
stick around after that?

15:18.439 --> 15:19.570
Did he talk to anybody else?

15:19.614 --> 15:21.790
No, he was in a bad mood.
He left.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.966
Is Jax here now?

15:24.010 --> 15:26.186
The word is he's at
the network with his lawyers.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.971
A million people paid to stream
a fight that never happened.

15:29.015 --> 15:31.931
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

15:31.974 --> 15:34.020
<i>♪</i>

15:34.063 --> 15:37.458
Tommy got into it with Jax
the day of the fight?

15:37.501 --> 15:39.025
I had no idea.

15:39.068 --> 15:42.376
Well, so what do you know
about their relationship?

15:42.419 --> 15:44.421
Uh, he's the boss.

15:44.465 --> 15:46.032
They try to keep it cordial.

15:46.075 --> 15:48.034
Jax likes to tell his fighters
they're family,

15:48.077 --> 15:50.427
but guys like him,
they turn on a dime.

15:50.471 --> 15:52.168
You never talked to Tommy
at all on Friday?

15:52.212 --> 15:55.955
No, I took Duke to lunch,
we walked around the city.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.174
Then I went back to the hotel
to get ready for the fight.

15:58.218 --> 16:01.612
And Tommy was supposed
to stay here in this apartment?

16:01.656 --> 16:03.571
Anybody with him?
- No.

16:03.614 --> 16:06.008
He cooks himself a lean meal,
does some light cardio,

16:06.052 --> 16:07.357
gets in his zone.

16:07.401 --> 16:09.620
Everyone just gives him space
before a fight.

16:09.664 --> 16:13.146
Okay, so cardio.
What, does he run or bike?

16:13.189 --> 16:14.408
Where would he have done that?

16:14.451 --> 16:16.627
He uses the elliptical
or the treadmill.

16:16.671 --> 16:18.499
We've got a great gym
in the basement.

16:18.542 --> 16:21.284
I can get the concierge
to show it to you.

16:21.328 --> 16:23.460
So Tommy's wife
said that he may have

16:23.504 --> 16:25.288
worked out here on Friday.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.247
Are there--
are there any cameras?

16:27.290 --> 16:29.814
No--the condo board
voted against it.

16:29.858 --> 16:31.729
The women didn't want
to be ogled.

16:31.773 --> 16:33.862
There's only one view,
and that's of the entrance.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.516
Did he have any guests
that day?

16:35.559 --> 16:37.039
Not through the lobby.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.824
Are there any other entrances
in the building?

16:39.868 --> 16:41.696
There's a back door
in the basement.

16:42.740 --> 16:45.134
Terrible.
Just terrible what happened.

16:45.178 --> 16:46.570
Tommy's such a good guy.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.529
Always holds the elevator
for other people,

16:48.572 --> 16:50.922
all the kids
in the building love him.

16:50.966 --> 16:52.533
The exit leads
to the parking garage.

16:52.576 --> 16:53.708
There's no cameras,

16:53.751 --> 16:55.057
so anybody could have
come in here

16:55.101 --> 16:57.364
without being noticed.
- Only if they have a key.

16:57.407 --> 17:00.019
Well, those are droplets
on the floor.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.456
- It could be blood.
- Get CSU in here.

17:05.372 --> 17:07.678
And Jax Bell is on his way in.

17:07.722 --> 17:09.680
Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Bell.

17:09.724 --> 17:11.030
I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.074
It's been a day.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.033
And I can't stay long.

17:14.076 --> 17:16.687
The pay-per-view people
are sitting in my office.

17:16.731 --> 17:19.603
But anything I can do to help,
I'm here.

17:19.647 --> 17:23.085
I really appreciate
the job you guys do.

17:23.129 --> 17:24.608
Thank you.

17:24.652 --> 17:26.567
Well, we're just trying
to piece together Tommy's day.

17:26.610 --> 17:29.700
So we know that he was
in your training facility.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.441
Did--did you two speak?

17:31.485 --> 17:32.703
Yeah, we did.

17:32.747 --> 17:35.358
Just wishing him well.

17:35.402 --> 17:37.882
That's not what we heard.

17:37.926 --> 17:40.059
How about we start over,
Mr. Bell?

17:40.102 --> 17:43.714
Because we already know that
you two were overheard arguing

17:43.758 --> 17:45.238
the morning of the fight.

17:45.281 --> 17:47.370
Okay, look.

17:47.414 --> 17:49.111
If this is gonna
turn adversarial,

17:49.155 --> 17:51.070
I can just walk out
and you can talk to my lawyers.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.855
I just lost
millions of dollars.

17:53.898 --> 17:56.466
The last thing I wanted was
for Tommy to miss that fight.

17:56.510 --> 17:58.077
Really?

17:58.120 --> 18:01.036
Even though he was planning
to come out right after?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.211
Right there in the ring?

18:02.255 --> 18:03.386
And you were okay with that?

18:03.430 --> 18:05.562
Hell, yes, I was.

18:05.606 --> 18:07.738
<i>[tense music]</i>

18:07.782 --> 18:10.872
We were gonna build
a whole campaign about it.

18:10.915 --> 18:15.355
Our first openly gay
male fighter.

18:15.398 --> 18:17.226
Our rainbow warrior.

18:17.270 --> 18:19.010
Nike, Wheaties.

18:19.054 --> 18:21.187
Hell, we were even
talking to Trojan.

18:21.230 --> 18:25.234
Tens of millions of dollars
were tied to that announcement.

18:25.278 --> 18:26.844
Okay.

18:26.888 --> 18:29.543
But you still didn't tell us
what you were fighting about.

18:29.586 --> 18:32.372
Tommy came in to tell me
he couldn't go through with it.

18:32.415 --> 18:34.896
- He got cold feet?
- Not exactly.

18:34.939 --> 18:36.985
His dad.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.813
Surprised him.

18:38.856 --> 18:41.163
So he didn't want to tell
the world that he was gay

18:41.207 --> 18:42.382
in front of his father?

18:42.425 --> 18:43.818
More like he was afraid to.

18:43.861 --> 18:46.516
Tommy said
his dad would kill him.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.301
You believe Tommy?

18:48.344 --> 18:50.868
All I know is, Duke Baker?

18:50.912 --> 18:53.610

19:00.095 --> 19:01.792

it was Tommy's blood type

19:01.836 --> 19:03.054
on the floor of that gym.

19:03.098 --> 19:05.100
- Okay. You running the DNA?
- Yeah.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.841

a little after 5:00 p.m.

who's that the wheel.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.935
Just a heads up,
Duke Baker's on his way in.

19:13.978 --> 19:15.197
Okay,
what do you know about him?

19:15.241 --> 19:17.460
Uh, legendary ass kicker.

19:17.504 --> 19:19.506
Fought in tough-man
competitions all over Georgia

19:19.549 --> 19:22.073
including every bar
in my hometown.

19:22.117 --> 19:23.640
- Does he have a record?
- No convictions.

19:23.684 --> 19:26.339
But his brother's on the force
with Gwinnett PD.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.079

19:28.123 --> 19:29.820

19:31.648 --> 19:34.085
Velasco, one thing
you're gonna learn on this job,

19:34.129 --> 19:36.610

19:41.832 --> 19:43.878
Yes.

19:43.921 --> 19:45.749

19:45.793 --> 19:47.969
Ah, so you've heard
the rumors going around

19:48.012 --> 19:49.927
about McGrath, right?

19:49.971 --> 19:51.277
What kind of rumors?

19:51.320 --> 19:53.540
A domestic incident
in his house in Syosset

19:53.583 --> 19:56.151
late Thursday night.
Cops were called.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.326
He mention that to you?

19:57.370 --> 19:58.806
He did.

19:58.849 --> 20:00.982
Just said that one of
his daughters was acting out.

20:01.025 --> 20:02.549
And they got into it a bit.

20:02.592 --> 20:05.813
But, uh, he left out the part
about the police response.

20:05.856 --> 20:07.075
So he didn't tell you

20:07.118 --> 20:08.468
when the Nassau County cops
got there,

20:08.511 --> 20:12.341
he told them to report it
as unfounded?

20:12.385 --> 20:14.213
That's abuse of the badge, Liv.

20:14.256 --> 20:17.433
Fin, you've never told
a cop that you were on the job

20:17.477 --> 20:19.174
when you got pulled over?
- That's not the same.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.263
Look, I know
that you don't like the guy.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.396
All right,
but you're not expecting me

20:23.439 --> 20:26.007
to go over his head
and use this to take him out?

20:26.050 --> 20:27.487
No, no, no, no.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.880
Just maybe mention to him
that you've heard the rumors.

20:29.924 --> 20:32.274
And you got his back.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.711
Can't be bad to have
a little leverage on that guy.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.235
All right, Fin.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.456
Mr. Baker,
thank you for coming in.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.023
I know this is
a very hard time.

20:42.066 --> 20:43.329
Tommy's still in a coma.

20:43.372 --> 20:45.287
Doctors can't tell us
a damn thing.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.768
Can you?
- I...

20:47.811 --> 20:48.769
That's what I thought.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.118
We are still working
the case.

20:50.161 --> 20:51.119
We could use your help.
- Yeah.

20:51.162 --> 20:52.903
Can I get you
a cup of coffee?

20:52.947 --> 20:54.296
No. Let's just get to it.

20:56.907 --> 20:59.214
I never wanted him and Chrissy
to come here.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.216
You know, Tommy coulda done
just fine

21:01.260 --> 21:02.348
on the Southern circuit.

21:02.391 --> 21:03.740
But he needed the big time.

21:03.784 --> 21:05.699
It's been ten years,
and my family still thinks

21:05.742 --> 21:07.918
I'll come to my senses
and move back to Georgia.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.180
[chuckles]

21:09.224 --> 21:11.487
Your trip to New York
was a surprise

21:11.531 --> 21:13.097
for Tommy and Chrissy,
isn't that right?

21:13.141 --> 21:14.751
I didn't want them
fussing over me.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.536
- Mm.
- Didn't work.

21:16.579 --> 21:19.887
They insisted I stay
in this fancy-ass hotel.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.280
Chrissy stayed with me.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.194
Probably to make sure
I didn't check myself out.

21:23.238 --> 21:25.153
You hadn't been up to visit,
though, much.

21:25.196 --> 21:27.111
Why now?

21:27.155 --> 21:28.809
I have my reasons.

21:28.852 --> 21:30.985
Anything to do
with Tommy's announcement?

21:31.028 --> 21:32.726
Ha. No.

21:32.769 --> 21:35.729
No, Tommy don't involve me
in his business dealings.

21:35.772 --> 21:38.209
No, he's got people
for that now.

21:38.253 --> 21:41.082
Just like he has people
to train him now.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.823
I--

21:42.866 --> 21:45.304
I used to go see Tommy
fight at Champs

21:45.347 --> 21:47.436
when he was a little kid.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.569
You were training him then.

21:49.612 --> 21:51.266
Yeah, so I was.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.225
But I was just
a bar-room brawler.

21:54.269 --> 21:56.358
You know, that's only gonna
take you so far.

21:56.402 --> 21:59.361
Yeah, that still must have
stung a little.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.842
That people were saying
that he boxed you out.

You think I have some hand
in this obscenity?

22:11.939 --> 22:14.376
No, I'm--I'm doing my job.

22:14.420 --> 22:17.292
And I have to ask if there's
any bad blood between you?

22:19.033 --> 22:22.471
I may not have been
the best father, okay?

22:22.515 --> 22:26.475
But all I ever wanted to do
was to protect that boy.

22:27.563 --> 22:29.957
And that's why I taught him
to fight in the first place.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.306
'Cause I knew he'd need it.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.916
Because?

22:32.960 --> 22:36.267
You see what they're saying.
You've seen the headlines.

22:36.311 --> 22:37.921
And I always knew he was.

22:38.705 --> 22:40.663
But I just figured
if I was tough on him

22:40.707 --> 22:44.624
and made him follow
in the traditions of Baker men,

22:44.667 --> 22:46.365
maybe...

22:49.890 --> 22:51.892
After his mother died,

22:51.935 --> 22:55.286
I might have been
too hard on him after that.

22:56.592 --> 22:58.420
And he got away from me
first chance he could.

22:59.856 --> 23:03.817
And now I'm running out of time
to make things right.

23:03.860 --> 23:05.558
The doctors say
he's gonna pull through.

23:05.601 --> 23:06.863
He's got a good chance.

23:06.907 --> 23:10.519
Thank God,
but I got pancreatic cancer.

23:10.563 --> 23:12.173
And the doctors say
I got two months.

23:12.216 --> 23:13.348
I'm so sorry.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.481

23:18.222 --> 23:19.485

23:19.528 --> 23:21.574
- When was that?
- Thursday.

23:21.617 --> 23:25.795
And we started talking,
and he got a phone call.

23:25.839 --> 23:28.363

from one of his money people,

23:28.407 --> 23:31.235
and he was on the phone
for a long time.

23:31.279 --> 23:32.933
And then he was late
for the weigh-in.

23:32.976 --> 23:36.327
And he said
we'll talk after the fight.

you saw him?

here to make amends.

from Duke.

Tommy got a phone call
about his finances

24:14.757 --> 24:16.106
Okay, we go through

24:17.717 --> 24:19.806
with his business manager
on Thursday night.

24:19.849 --> 24:20.894

not willing to talk

a Porsche for $10,000 a month.

Ricky was part of our crew that

back in the house, huh?

I am sure that that night

38:52.721 --> 38:55.202
was scary for all of you.

38:55.245 --> 38:58.814
Maybe finding out
how and why it happened

38:58.858 --> 39:00.990
isn't such a bad idea.

39:01.034 --> 39:04.211
You've been a little rough
around the edges at work too.

39:05.343 --> 39:09.390
Asking for help,
there's no shame in that.

39:09.434 --> 39:12.741
Okay. I'll look into it.

39:12.785 --> 39:14.961
But the last thing I need is
- someone at 1
- PP

39:15.004 --> 39:16.179
thinking I'm seeing a shrink.

39:16.223 --> 39:17.703
Well, they're not gonna
hear it from me.

39:17.746 --> 39:19.661
I appreciate that,
but you know how this place is.

39:19.705 --> 39:22.751
If someone can get a rung up
by pulling me down,

39:22.795 --> 39:23.970
then they will.
