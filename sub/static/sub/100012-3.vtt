16:56.600 --> 17:00.400
Perhaps it's what you deserve,
with your filthy words.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.449
I used to fuck seven men a day,

17:05.560 --> 17:07.961
and now I'm learning
how to ride a horse side-saddle.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.448
There's good and there's evil.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.449
There's both mixed.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.965
And that's Arthur and you...and me?

17:21.079 --> 17:24.367
You don't get what you deserve,
you get what you take.

17:26.280 --> 17:28.248
What about him?

17:32.960 --> 17:34.962
He's making up his mind.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)

17:41.480 --> 17:43.687
(DOOR OPENS)

17:46.680 --> 17:49.160
Someone called Polly Gray to see you.

17:51.920 --> 17:55.003
Yes or no?

17:55.120 --> 17:56.451
Yes.

17:56.560 --> 17:58.961
(FOOTSTEPS RECEDE)

18:02.760 --> 18:04.285
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)

18:18.040 --> 18:19.963
I've come to take you to the clinic.

18:20.080 --> 18:22.560
I already told Michael-
my husband or no-one.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.409
I've got a car.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.285
They have taxis,
even in this fucking city.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.688
Look, if they don't hear a heartbeat,
they're gonna give you options.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.404
None of them are nice.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.489
I had my check-up three days ago.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.329
They heard a beating heart.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.330
But if they had told me
that baby had died inside of me,

18:40.440 --> 18:42.522
I would have wanted someone with me.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.010
My husband may do as he's told,

18:46.120 --> 18:48.202
but, er, I don't.

18:48.320 --> 18:51.403
Look, if they hear a heartbeat,
you won't need anybody with you,

18:51.520 --> 18:53.204
cos you'll have the baby with you.

18:53.320 --> 18:55.049
So I will leave you alone.

18:55.160 --> 18:58.607
But if you get in a taxi in this city
and they hear your accent,

18:58.720 --> 19:00.722
they'll take you on a grand tour.

19:03.680 --> 19:04.806
Come on.

19:10.200 --> 19:14.000
- So, when will Mum be home?
- She said she had to go to Birmingham.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.726
- Do you want me to cook you something?
- Cook?

19:16.840 --> 19:18.444
You're a man.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.965
This is really not fair.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.367
Your mother never told me
you were this good.

19:28.480 --> 19:30.687
I'm in a club. I'm the champion.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.723
I beat people even older than you.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.286
Even older than me? (CHUCKLES)

19:37.760 --> 19:42.368
At school, some of the children
say that black people and jews are worse.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.323
Worse than what?

19:44.440 --> 19:46.488
Than anything.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.329
And one teacher,

19:48.440 --> 19:49.930
Mr Hudson,

19:50.040 --> 19:52.566
he calls my friend a little Jew boy.

19:56.040 --> 20:00.602
Karl, these days,
there are some very stupid people

20:00.720 --> 20:03.405
saying some very stupid things.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.284
0K?

20:06.440 --> 20:07.646
What do you think?

20:14.040 --> 20:15.121
Checkmate.

20:18.280 --> 20:20.760
I think I don't want you to be my dad.

20:20.880 --> 20:23.850
Cos my dad's white...and he's in heaven.

20:44.520 --> 20:48.445
POLLY: I came to see you in hospital
to tell you there's a strategy in place,

20:48.560 --> 20:50.085
not to break you out.

20:50.200 --> 20:54.285
Don't worry,
my sister will look after me.

20:57.280 --> 20:59.203
You must stay here,

20:59.320 --> 21:02.767
and you'll let Tommy deal
with the men who killed your son.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.289
You're 45 today.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.448
I'm probably a bit older than that.

21:19.760 --> 21:21.091
Probably.

21:23.360 --> 21:24.600
I've dealt death.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.841
Now death has dealt with me.

21:30.600 --> 21:34.491
I have one more killing to do
then I'll be done.

21:38.920 --> 21:41.127
Happy birthday, Polly Gray.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.450
(GREET IN ROMANY)

22:38.680 --> 22:40.091
Get a car and a driver.

22:40.200 --> 22:43.249
Find out where the Fury family are camped.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.647
I need their men to help me.

22:45.760 --> 22:49.367
I'll need my hunting rifle, 5O bullets.

22:49.480 --> 22:51.528
I'm going to Scotland.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.762
Yeah. Give you a key, did she?

23:13.880 --> 23:16.247
I was meant to meet her today,
but she said had to go to Birmingham.

23:16.360 --> 23:17.805
Yes. Tommy sent her on a mission.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.285
She's doing my job for me.

23:19.400 --> 23:20.526
Where's Karl, eh? Where's the boy?

23:20.640 --> 23:22.449
He went to buy an ice cream.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.369
Ada said to tell you she'd be late.

23:24.480 --> 23:27.404
- You knew I'd be here?
- Yeah, we knew you'd be here.

23:27.520 --> 23:29.284
We have some business for you.

Ah, Michael.
You still have shit on your shoes.

23:47.080 --> 23:49.048
My associate here can evidently smell it.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.286
I don't mean any of fence.

23:50.400 --> 23:52.880
Here, Michael, go and find Karl

23:53.000 --> 23:55.446
and buy him an ice cream, eh?

23:55.560 --> 23:56.891
The man doesn't trust you.

23:58.080 --> 23:59.923
Fuck you, Tom.

24:07.840 --> 24:09.080
You know Gina phoned.

24:13.040 --> 24:15.008

24:18.080 --> 24:20.970
by the time
that baby draws its first breath,

24:21.080 --> 24:22.127
you and I will be done.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.762
And you will be king.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.120
Is that it, Michael?

24:33.240 --> 24:34.810
You know, Tom,

24:34.920 --> 24:36.763
there are doctors in London now

24:36.880 --> 24:40.089
who can talk their way into your head,
dig out all the shit.

You should read it.

(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

25:17.320 --> 25:19.721
What investigation is he talking about?

25:22.320 --> 25:25.927
Two weeks ago,
a journalist was killed in Maida Vale.

25:26.040 --> 25:29.089
The night before,
he'd come to me about some story

25:29.200 --> 25:31.202
he was going to write about me.

25:31.320 --> 25:32.924
We had nothing to do with that killing.

25:33.040 --> 25:35.008
Mosley wants you as his deputy?

25:36.600 --> 25:38.409
His constituency is Smethwick.

25:38.520 --> 25:39.521
It borders my own.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.165
He wants Birmingham as his stronghold.

25:41.280 --> 25:44.648
He knows I've...strong support
among working people.

25:44.760 --> 25:49.607
We help him out at rallies,
show up at some town hall meetings.

25:49.720 --> 25:52.849
Right, and why are you showing
this letter to me?

25:52.960 --> 25:54.371
A Minister of State

25:54.480 --> 25:57.086
who may have seditious intentions.

25:57.200 --> 25:59.202
There's no proof of sedition
in this letter.

25:59.320 --> 26:00.890
You work in intelligence, Younger.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.207
You don't need proof.
Give it to your superiors.

26:03.320 --> 26:06.483
Mr Shelby, I have a very specific brief.

26:06.600 --> 26:10.730
My brief is specifically
to gather information

26:10.840 --> 26:12.763
on the activities of communists.

26:15.360 --> 26:18.569
Your immediate superior
in the intelligence unit

26:18.680 --> 26:21.411
is a Colonel Patrick Wyatt, yeah?

26:21.520 --> 26:26.367
I understand he regularly plays polo
with Oswald Mosley.

26:26.480 --> 26:30.690
They share membership of various clubs
in London and Birmingham.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.040
I have specific orders.

26:32.160 --> 26:33.491
I am a soldier.

26:33.600 --> 26:36.410
You think you can join this family?

26:37.840 --> 26:40.571
I have no intention of joining a family.

26:40.680 --> 26:44.287
Well, thank fuck for that,
cos, er, you'd hate our weddings.

26:44.400 --> 26:47.085
Thought you said this was about business.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.009
Yes - family business
and government business,

26:49.120 --> 26:50.485
all in one envelope.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.481

26:57.600 --> 26:59.250
Forget about Ada.

26:59.360 --> 27:00.964
Forget about weddings.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.804
You know what Mosley represents.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.968
You know his philosophy.

27:08.680 --> 27:12.401
I am planning to reply to him
and tell him that I'm making up my mind.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.888
But in the meantime,
you need to give me instruction.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.843
I could fight him on my own, if I have to,

27:18.960 --> 27:22.169
or I could join his organisation

27:22.280 --> 27:26.171
and undermine him on behalf of the King.

27:26.280 --> 27:28.726
But you need to make a decision.

27:46.120 --> 27:49.920
I suppose there are a few things
I can do on my own initiative.

You see, we all try and get away.

32:32.720 --> 32:34.882
But we never do.

32:45.720 --> 32:49.202
I wish I felt that heartbeat today.

32:53.120 --> 32:55.964
You're starting to sound
a little sorry for yourself.

32:59.040 --> 33:01.168
I'm an American.

33:02.520 --> 33:04.727
We don't just go round
and round and round.

33:04.840 --> 33:05.966
We go in a straight line.

33:07.440 --> 33:11.570
And my baby...will be born in New York.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.366
I'm not happy about moving this meeting
to licensed premises.

33:28.560 --> 33:33.361
You've saved your union the train fare,
and you hate London anyway.

33:33.480 --> 33:36.723
We're looking for popular speakers
for our upcoming rally.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.923
You're making quite a name for yourself
in the Commons.

33:40.040 --> 33:41.644
Betty!

33:41.760 --> 33:43.250
What are you drinking?

33:43.360 --> 33:44.521
Water.

33:44.640 --> 33:46.563
Bottle of Champagne, Betty.

33:46.680 --> 33:48.728
You'll drink it on your own.

33:48.840 --> 33:49.966
That's the idea.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.889
Shall we sit down, Miss Eden?

(CORK CLATTERS)

34:17.159 --> 34:18.685
Revolution.

34:21.080 --> 34:24.527
So, how is life as a socialist?

34:26.239 --> 34:27.571
This glass.

34:29.080 --> 34:30.127
The bubbles.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.849
They rise to the top.

34:35.280 --> 34:38.329
Each bubble has the same chance to rise.

34:38.440 --> 34:41.330
That is a very peculiar form of socialism.

34:41.440 --> 34:42.487
And this bottle.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.404
Once the cork comes out...

34:48.040 --> 34:50.646
...you can't get it back in.

34:50.760 --> 34:52.649
You need to finish what you started.

34:54.320 --> 34:56.561
It's cleverness, that's all.

34:59.320 --> 35:01.243
So you're playing at this.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.522
People can be turned around.

35:05.320 --> 35:06.242
Even your people.

35:06.360 --> 35:08.806
- My people?
- Yeah.

35:08.920 --> 35:10.968
For them, it's just the same.

35:11.080 --> 35:13.924
Communism. Fascism.

35:14.040 --> 35:17.044
For most people,
it's an apple and an apple.

35:17.160 --> 35:19.208
Fascism is the subject of the rally.

35:19.320 --> 35:22.051
I want you to speak against it.

35:22.160 --> 35:23.924
In answer to your question...

35:25.160 --> 35:27.049
...I cannot address your rally...

35:28.480 --> 35:30.801
...because it's not part
of the current strategy.

35:33.880 --> 35:35.962
Are you OK, Thomas?

35:36.080 --> 35:38.970
Do you want a man to carry you home?

(GLASS TUMBLES)

35:40.920 --> 35:43.924

I warn you, I'll break your heart.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.764
(COUGHS)

36:31.240 --> 36:33.083
I didn't expect you home.

36:36.320 --> 36:39.324
Frances said Linda was here today.

36:39.440 --> 36:42.922
Frances has a very specific loyalty,
doesn't she?

36:44.560 --> 36:48.007
Well, people are loyal
to those who pay their wages.

36:49.840 --> 36:54.050
Also, Maggie at the exchange
said you made some calls.

36:54.160 --> 36:56.208
Then you'll know I called a solicitor.

36:57.240 --> 36:59.402
Did Maggie listen in to the conversation?

37:05.320 --> 37:06.890
He said he'd represent me.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.889
But I put the phone down.

37:11.480 --> 37:13.642
There and then, I made a decision.

37:15.720 --> 37:19.770
And when I heard your car pull up,
I got changed.

37:24.720 --> 37:27.087
You said, in your head,
you still pay for it.

37:28.800 --> 37:31.041
So I've decided to continue
to take the payment

37:31.160 --> 37:32.889
and balance my heart against my head,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.241
as though it were a book of accounts.

37:35.360 --> 37:39.126
- I value my head a shilling more.
- Huh!

37:42.360 --> 37:47.730
When was the last time
you had to worry about shillings, eh?

37:48.880 --> 37:52.566
People are loyal to those
who pay their wages.

37:52.680 --> 37:54.523
That's why I'll be loyal to you.

37:56.680 --> 37:59.411
But this is the deal.

37:59.520 --> 38:02.729
You don't fuck anybody else in my house,

38:02.840 --> 38:04.888
nor within a day
of holding our child by the hand.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.570
A day on either side.

38:08.640 --> 38:11.689
And you let me in sometimes.

38:11.800 --> 38:12.926
Into your head.

38:16.680 --> 38:18.045
To clear it out.

38:18.160 --> 38:20.401
That what needs clearing out.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.005
Agreed.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.445
And this...

38:29.560 --> 38:31.608
Always.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.768
The deal is...

38:35.880 --> 38:37.120
...you belong to me.

38:38.600 --> 38:39.681
MY property.

38:41.320 --> 38:43.243
No-one touches my property.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.162
I touch myself, but it's still you anyway.

38:49.280 --> 38:51.806
So that's why I put the phone down.

38:58.240 --> 38:59.685

I don't have an address.

41:00.280 --> 41:02.851
But she's with the Quakers in Bournville.

41:03.920 --> 41:07.242
<i>Apparently,
there is someone who is a Friend.</i>

41:08.320 --> 41:13.008
He had a wife who died
from Spanish flu in 1918.

And he has a daughter.

for his crucifixion,

50:46.360 --> 50:50.888
it will be me who drives in the nails.

51:34.280 --> 51:36.169
Mr Shelby!

51:36.280 --> 51:38.248
At last you are alone.

51:40.640 --> 51:42.404
I think we'll make quite the team.

51:44.520 --> 51:46.602
The pheasants won't know what hit them.

51:46.720 --> 51:50.281

51:51.680 --> 51:53.489
You're a fine shot, Mr Shelby.

51:55.040 --> 51:56.530
You were in the yeomanry, yes?

51:57.800 --> 51:59.529
Were you cavalry?

51:59.640 --> 52:02.450
You won the Distinguished Service Medal.

52:02.560 --> 52:03.607
That'll help.

52:04.880 --> 52:05.881
With what?

52:07.320 --> 52:09.766
Two months ago, I was in Rome.

52:09.880 --> 52:11.211
I met Mr Mussolini.

52:12.320 --> 52:14.004
You and I and men like him...

52:16.360 --> 52:18.044
...we will shape the future.

52:20.480 --> 52:22.403
When will you resign
from the Labour Party?

52:25.240 --> 52:28.050
The day before I announce
the formation of my new party.

52:30.960 --> 52:35.887
The British Union of Fascists will be born
on January 1st of next year.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.490
The first day of a new decade.

52:41.080 --> 52:44.289
The 1930s, Mr Shelby, will belong to us.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.565
Did you bring that cigar?

52:52.080 --> 52:53.161
Before we smoke...

52:54.400 --> 52:55.765
...I have some conditions.

52:58.120 --> 53:00.521
It really isn't going to be
that kind of relationship.

53:04.640 --> 53:07.120
Just smoke like the fine man
you will become.

53:15.720 --> 53:18.405
(BIG BEN CHIMES)

53:22.880 --> 53:24.882
Yes, Colonel Ben Younger.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.924

code 78.

53:30.400 --> 53:32.289
It's me. (CLEARS HIS THROAT)

53:32.400 --> 53:34.289
I've agreed to work with our friend.

53:35.560 --> 53:38.040
He's gonna announce on January 1st.

53:38.160 --> 53:41.164
I need to know that my position
as informant against him

53:41.280 --> 53:42.520
is officially sanctioned.

(BAND PLAYS)

53:50.280 --> 53:52.601
Today, gentlemen,

53:52.720 --> 53:56.281
we are avenging an unprovoked attack

53:56.400 --> 53:58.721
on members of our organisation

53:58.840 --> 54:02.811
who were simply carrying out
a routine border patrol.

54:02.920 --> 54:05.241
Our enemies are Gypsies,

54:05.360 --> 54:10.082
members of a race destined
for natural eradication anyway,

54:10.200 --> 54:13.409
due to what the scientists call selection.

54:14.840 --> 54:18.970
And since these beggars
are unchristened and unregistered,

54:19.080 --> 54:21.447
the local constabulary
will as soon drop them

54:21.560 --> 54:25.451
in a communal grave
as find a name for a gravestone.

54:26.960 --> 54:32.171
So proceed in any manner you choose
to find the fugitive we seek.

- Yeah.

54:44.400 --> 54:46.323
The Billy Boys are coming for you.

54:46.440 --> 54:48.090
How the fuck did you find me?

54:49.680 --> 54:52.081
- How the fuck did theyfind me?
- I kind of let it slip.

54:52.200 --> 54:54.202
Give you no choice, eh?

54:54.320 --> 54:56.482
What, hmm? What?

55:05.120 --> 55:07.327
And a Bentley outside, the engine running.

55:07.440 --> 55:09.807
Fastest engine in the world,
apparently, which is good.

55:09.920 --> 55:12.764
We've got two minutes to get out of here.

55:12.880 --> 55:15.167

55:35.440 --> 55:38.922
We are seeking a man
by the name of Aberama Gold.

Hand the gentleman over,
and no-one else will be harmed.
