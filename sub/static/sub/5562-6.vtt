WEBVTT

00:11.445 --> 00:13.411
Man:
Your product, gentlemen.

00:13.413 --> 00:16.347
I'll test it.
Give me a minute, boss.

00:16.349 --> 00:17.781
You're the expert.

00:21.753 --> 00:23.319
I can use the time
to count the money.

00:29.660 --> 00:31.793
Two million.

00:31.795 --> 00:32.794
In full.

00:42.771 --> 00:44.203
It's real.

00:48.309 --> 00:49.808
So is this.

00:49.810 --> 00:51.409
Binetex.
Small mass,

00:51.411 --> 00:53.077
Very big bang.

00:55.815 --> 00:57.581
We are done here.

00:59.151 --> 01:02.152
It was supposed to be 50 pounds.

01:02.154 --> 01:03.453
Where's the rest of it?

01:03.455 --> 01:06.189
You can keep the car.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.356
It's in
the trunk.

01:07.358 --> 01:09.825
Let's go!

01:09.827 --> 01:11.425
Put the case down.

01:14.396 --> 01:16.062
Let me guess,

01:16.064 --> 01:17.830
Your man checked the car.

01:17.832 --> 01:19.198
Put the money down

01:19.200 --> 01:20.732
And be thankful
we're letting you

01:20.734 --> 01:22.100
Walk away.

01:33.146 --> 01:33.511
(shouts)

01:37.083 --> 01:39.249
(gunshots continue)

01:41.853 --> 01:43.185
(grunts)

01:45.189 --> 01:46.555
Cover me!

02:03.707 --> 02:04.706
(engine starts)

02:04.708 --> 02:06.708
(tires screeching)

02:06.710 --> 02:08.676
(panting)

02:17.853 --> 02:20.119
(beeping)

02:56.890 --> 02:59.156
(loud slurping)

03:09.901 --> 03:11.500
You enjoying that?

03:11.502 --> 03:13.835
Oh, you mean
my smoothie?

03:13.837 --> 03:15.570
Funny you should mention it,
'cause I really feel

03:15.572 --> 03:17.505
Like I'm missing
something.

03:17.507 --> 03:20.541
He's just upset because
I finished his protein powder.
You put it

03:20.543 --> 03:21.708
On your ice cream.
You left it

03:21.710 --> 03:23.609
At my house.
I didn't think you'd mind.

03:23.611 --> 03:25.277
I wrote my name on the lid.
Who writes
their name

03:25.279 --> 03:27.612
On things they then leave
at their girlfriend's house?

03:27.614 --> 03:28.913
Do you still write your name
on your underwear?

03:28.915 --> 03:30.814
I need to mark
my territory.

03:30.816 --> 03:31.748
Poor choice of words.

03:31.750 --> 03:33.382
Yeah.
The bottom line is

03:33.384 --> 03:34.649
You're just really bad
with personal boundaries.

03:34.651 --> 03:35.916
Oh.
(callen laughs)

03:35.918 --> 03:37.183
(laughs)

03:37.185 --> 03:38.584
Something funny?

03:38.586 --> 03:40.819
You two having
a discussion

03:40.821 --> 03:42.220
About boundaries?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.754
Isn't that
a little ironic?

03:43.756 --> 03:45.288
Iron... Explain that.
Most people

03:45.290 --> 03:46.822
Bring their work lives home.

03:46.824 --> 03:48.290
You guys bring your
home lives to work.

03:48.292 --> 03:49.391
Boundaries

03:49.393 --> 03:51.226
Get blurry.
Deeks and I

03:51.228 --> 03:53.661
Keep our work lives and
personal lives very separate.

03:53.663 --> 03:55.462
I have a rule
about that.
Really?

03:55.464 --> 03:56.930
Yeah.
What about
that little...

03:56.932 --> 03:58.665
Display of affection last week

03:58.667 --> 04:01.367
On lincoln at
the stop light?
Ha!

04:01.369 --> 04:05.237
(chuckles) didn't know
you guys were behind us.
And...

04:05.239 --> 04:07.572
The fight over
who gets the side of the bed

04:07.574 --> 04:10.308
That's closest to the bathroom.
Eric:
Oh,

04:10.310 --> 04:12.643
Or deeks telling us
how kensi likes to hang-dry

04:12.645 --> 04:14.311
Her underwear
in the living room.

04:14.312 --> 04:15.978
Deeks, you hang-dry
your underwear.

04:15.981 --> 04:17.447
Yeah. In the bathroom,

04:17.449 --> 04:19.849
Where things are supposed
to hang-dry.

04:19.851 --> 04:21.250
And there it is.

04:21.252 --> 04:23.485
Boundaries obliterated.

04:23.487 --> 04:26.221
More stuff I
can never un-hear.

04:26.223 --> 04:26.988
Granger and hetty...
Request

04:26.990 --> 04:29.657
Our presence up in ops, perhaps?

04:29.659 --> 04:31.992
Uh, actually,
want to talk to sam.

04:31.994 --> 04:34.260
Alone.

04:42.970 --> 04:45.236
What's going on?

04:45.238 --> 04:48.639
Take a look, agent hanna.

04:48.641 --> 04:50.007
Nell:
Atf retrieved this

04:50.009 --> 04:51.875
Surveillance video
from last night.

04:51.877 --> 04:54.310
(filtered):
All good.

04:54.312 --> 04:55.944
That's mark.
Yes,

04:55.946 --> 04:57.011
It is.

04:57.013 --> 04:58.479
Mark ruiz
was working

04:58.481 --> 05:00.848
As an undercover asset for atf.

05:00.850 --> 05:02.282
Nell: He infiltrated
a militia group

05:02.284 --> 05:04.917
Started
by gary madison.
Madison was trying

05:04.919 --> 05:07.586
To buy a large amount
of a new experimental explosive

05:07.588 --> 05:09.387
Called binetex.

05:09.389 --> 05:10.988
Ruiz mounted
the camera

05:10.990 --> 05:13.390
Inside the grill of the car
to record the buy.

05:13.392 --> 05:18.661
Atf said
that case contains the money.

05:18.663 --> 05:20.863
$2 million.
Did atf

05:20.865 --> 05:22.264
I.D. The sellers?

05:22.266 --> 05:23.498
The leader is a man
named ramon santos,

05:23.500 --> 05:25.867
But they can't find
any background on him.

05:25.869 --> 05:29.269
Nell: And here's the rest
of the video we recovered.

05:32.774 --> 05:33.939
Sam:
Looks like the deal

05:33.941 --> 05:35.607
Went south.

05:35.609 --> 05:37.442
There's the sellers
leaving.

05:39.312 --> 05:41.278
Now watch this.

05:47.051 --> 05:49.317
(beeping)

05:50.320 --> 05:52.053
Can you think
of any reason

05:52.055 --> 05:54.588
Why your ex-partner
would want to kill

05:54.590 --> 05:57.057
Madison
and his men?

05:57.059 --> 06:00.860
No, but that doesn't
mean there isn't one.

06:00.862 --> 06:02.428
Hetty:
The trouble is ruiz

06:02.430 --> 06:06.965
Hasn't checked in
with his atf handlers in weeks.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.300
Atf has asked for our
help in finding him.

06:09.302 --> 06:10.668
Given he is

06:10.670 --> 06:13.303
A former ncis agent.

06:13.305 --> 06:14.337
His behavior

06:14.339 --> 06:16.339
Is erratic, at best.

06:16.341 --> 06:18.674
Criminal, at worst.

06:18.676 --> 06:21.343
You think mark is dirty?

06:21.345 --> 06:26.347
I know you've personally
invested a lot in him, sam.

06:26.349 --> 06:28.982
But when he left
ncis, it was

06:28.984 --> 06:31.050
Because of his drug problem.

06:31.052 --> 06:33.318
Mark has been clean
going on ten years.

06:33.320 --> 06:34.319
Have you
seen him

06:34.321 --> 06:36.354
Recently?

06:36.356 --> 06:37.888
Not in a while
but I know the man.

06:37.890 --> 06:39.356
Yes, well,
we all thought

06:39.358 --> 06:40.790
We knew the man.

06:40.792 --> 06:43.859
You want to be involved?
Or are you too close to this?

06:52.068 --> 06:54.735
I'll bring the team up to speed.

07:01.409 --> 07:03.742
Deeks:
Whoa. Wasn't
expecting that.

07:03.744 --> 07:05.477
Do we know who this guy is?

07:05.479 --> 07:07.045
Sam:
Man on the screen
is a freelance

07:07.047 --> 07:09.447
Atf asset.
His name is

07:09.449 --> 07:10.915
Mark ruiz.

07:10.917 --> 07:12.516
He was my first partner

07:12.518 --> 07:14.017
Before I met
callen.

07:14.019 --> 07:15.351
We worked together
for a year.

07:15.353 --> 07:17.753
I'm sorry. Rewind for a second.

07:17.755 --> 07:20.622
You had a partner at ncis
before callen?

07:20.624 --> 07:22.724
I did a lot of things
before I met callen.

07:22.726 --> 07:25.426
Ruiz was working
deep cover

07:25.428 --> 07:27.060
For a group
trying to buy binetex.

07:27.062 --> 07:29.695
Callen:
Military-grade
explosives.

07:29.697 --> 07:31.363
Supposed to be under lock
and key.

07:31.365 --> 07:33.081
None turned up missing,

07:33.082 --> 07:34.798
Which means someone must
have figured out the recipe.

07:34.801 --> 07:36.667
Why did ruiz leave ncis?

07:37.636 --> 07:40.402
Personal reasons.

07:43.473 --> 07:46.474
You think he detonated the bomb?

07:46.476 --> 07:48.409
Atf thinks he may have turned,

07:48.411 --> 07:50.144
Maybe
for his own financial gain.

07:50.146 --> 07:52.146
Maybe he lost his edge,
got frustrated,

07:52.148 --> 07:54.081
Killed the militia guys.

07:54.083 --> 07:56.083
Atf got it wrong.

07:56.085 --> 07:59.386
My former partner is not dirty,
and he's not a murderer.

07:59.388 --> 08:01.388
I'm just saying
people change, sam,

08:01.390 --> 08:03.423
Especially
when they're in deep cover.

08:03.425 --> 08:04.490
Deeks...
Kensi:
If we're gonna

08:04.492 --> 08:05.624
Work this case,

08:05.626 --> 08:07.892
We need to understand
what's going on.

08:07.894 --> 08:11.495
The debris from the blast didn't
damage all of the footage.

08:11.497 --> 08:13.563
I found more.

08:15.500 --> 08:18.968
Kensi:
Looks like ruiz went back
into the building.

08:18.970 --> 08:20.502
Callen:
Yeah. And that's

08:20.504 --> 08:21.503
The buyer's case.

08:21.505 --> 08:22.904
Deeks:
Last man standing

08:22.906 --> 08:26.107
Walks away with the money.

08:44.993 --> 08:46.926
You good?
I'm fine.

08:46.928 --> 08:48.928
Want to tell me why you're
sending kensi and deeks

08:48.930 --> 08:50.863
To the crime scene when you
are the explosives expert?

08:50.865 --> 08:52.831
Kensi's learned a lot.
She pays attention.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.033
She asks good questions.
She's got this.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.934
You want to tell me
where we're going?

08:56.936 --> 08:58.602
It's complicated.

08:58.604 --> 09:01.738
"mathlete trigonometry"
complicated

09:01.740 --> 09:03.773
Or "let's not tell
my partner" complicated?

09:03.775 --> 09:04.874
You getting in the car?

09:04.876 --> 09:06.208
Why didn't you tell the team

09:06.210 --> 09:07.709
The whole story back there?

09:07.711 --> 09:11.879
Because a lot of baggage comes
with the word "addict."

09:11.881 --> 09:13.547
And you don't think
there's any chance

09:13.549 --> 09:15.015
He could've relapsed again?

09:16.852 --> 09:18.785
Hey.

09:18.787 --> 09:20.987
If ruiz is dirty,

09:20.989 --> 09:22.855
You gonna be able
to put the cuffs on him?

09:22.857 --> 09:24.956
What do you think?

09:27.593 --> 09:29.859
(car door shuts)

09:29.861 --> 09:31.927
(engine starts)

09:34.965 --> 09:37.031
(indistinct chatter)

09:37.967 --> 09:40.701
Yikes.

09:40.703 --> 09:43.770
Looks like
a war zone.

09:47.876 --> 09:49.876
This is the blast crater.

09:49.878 --> 09:53.045
Detonation happened
right here.

09:53.047 --> 09:55.981
Look at how this wall buckled.

09:55.983 --> 09:58.183
It would have to be
a super high detonation velocity

09:58.185 --> 09:59.651
To cause this kind

09:59.653 --> 10:01.119
Of damage. Very
high brisance.

10:01.121 --> 10:03.788
Yeah, well,
I usually like my brisance

10:03.790 --> 10:06.991
With a little bit of jelly
in a café with pepé le pew.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.059
Oh, you mean
the other kind of brisance?

10:10.061 --> 10:11.894
The shattering capability
of a high explosive.

10:11.896 --> 10:13.095
Like binetex.

10:13.097 --> 10:17.165
Exactly like binetex, actually.

10:18.101 --> 10:21.802
What's going on with you?

10:21.804 --> 10:24.204
I just don't understand why
sam would protect some guy

10:24.206 --> 10:25.738
That may have killed
three people.

10:25.740 --> 10:27.740
I don't.
I do.

10:27.742 --> 10:29.842
(sighs)
because they were
partners. And to be

10:29.844 --> 10:31.977
Completely honest, I would do
the same thing for you.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.611
Not if I murdered someone.

10:34.847 --> 10:36.980
I mean, if you did it
for the right reasons, yeah.

10:36.982 --> 10:38.147
Yeah, I think I would.

10:41.685 --> 10:42.884
Boundaries.

10:42.886 --> 10:45.019
Right. We're-we're...
I'll be...

10:45.021 --> 10:47.021
Over here.

10:47.023 --> 10:49.089
(people talking indistinctly
nearby)

11:02.003 --> 11:04.136
Hey, check this out.

11:04.138 --> 11:05.637
What do you got?

11:06.606 --> 11:09.039
It's a piece of a sim card.

11:10.208 --> 11:12.541
Command detonation
by cell phone.

11:14.278 --> 11:15.944
I'll get it to eric.

11:15.946 --> 11:19.180
You want to tell sam
or should I?

11:24.053 --> 11:26.987
We already knew it was probably
detonated by a cell phone.

11:26.989 --> 11:28.888
Sim card doesn't
mean anything.

11:28.890 --> 11:30.956
I didn't say it did.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.692
Do you want me to guess
who we're going to see?

11:35.995 --> 11:39.262
Let's see, you didn't use gps
or the wonder twins to get here

11:39.264 --> 11:41.130
Which means you probably
know this person.

11:41.132 --> 11:43.198
You also didn't
check the address,

11:43.200 --> 11:45.667
Which means
you've been here before.

11:45.669 --> 11:47.568
What else, sherlock?

11:47.570 --> 11:49.136
We're not approaching
tactically

11:49.138 --> 11:50.937
And that means
you trust this person.

11:50.939 --> 11:52.138
Woman:
Don't forget your helmet!

11:52.140 --> 11:54.173
Got it.

11:55.142 --> 11:56.674
Mama,

11:56.676 --> 11:59.876
There's a super
ginormous man here.

12:01.045 --> 12:03.345
Sam.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.246
What a surprise.

12:05.248 --> 12:06.580
It's so good
to see you.

12:06.582 --> 12:08.949
Alicia ruiz, my partner, callen.

12:08.951 --> 12:11.084
Nice to meet you.

12:11.086 --> 12:12.285
Who are they?

12:12.287 --> 12:13.686
You don't remember sam?

12:13.688 --> 12:16.021
He's a friend
of your dad's.

12:16.957 --> 12:18.156
It's been a long time.

12:18.158 --> 12:20.691
Yeah, it has.

12:21.894 --> 12:24.927
Which means you're not
just dropping by, are you?

12:26.897 --> 12:28.830
Sam:
We just need to talk
to him, that's all.

12:28.832 --> 12:31.065
He hasn't checked in
with his handlers, has he?

12:31.067 --> 12:33.200
No.

12:33.202 --> 12:35.335
Have you heard from him?

12:35.337 --> 12:37.203
Mark's been pretty
much off the grid

12:37.205 --> 12:39.038
For the past
few months.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.939
But we're used to that.

12:40.941 --> 12:44.108
Not that anyone ever
really gets used to it.

12:44.110 --> 12:46.743
Are you two together?

12:49.114 --> 12:51.047
On again, off again.

12:52.016 --> 12:53.382
And now?

12:54.351 --> 12:57.018
Off again.

12:57.020 --> 12:59.320
Alicia, we really need you
to help us find him.

12:59.322 --> 13:01.789
And we need
to find him fast.

13:01.791 --> 13:04.025
You must have a number

13:04.026 --> 13:06.260
Or contact in case there's
an emergency with joey, or...

13:11.900 --> 13:13.699
That's his number.

13:15.636 --> 13:16.935
(phone clicks)

13:16.937 --> 13:18.069
I'll send this to nell,

13:18.071 --> 13:20.838
See if she can get
a gps location on him.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.040
Thank you for helping.

13:23.042 --> 13:25.642
(door opens, closes)

13:25.644 --> 13:27.944
How you really doing?

13:27.946 --> 13:30.146
Managing.

13:32.250 --> 13:33.949
How's kamran and aiden?

13:33.951 --> 13:35.150
Pictures?

13:35.152 --> 13:37.418
Yeah. There you are.

13:39.355 --> 13:41.355
Getting big.

13:41.357 --> 13:42.889
Just like joey.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.995
Mark chose work over us.

13:51.964 --> 13:54.731
He chose drugs over us.

13:54.733 --> 13:57.300
And joey knows it.

13:58.770 --> 14:00.102
You can only be pushed aside
for so long

14:00.104 --> 14:02.237
Before you start to think
you are the problem.

14:02.239 --> 14:04.172
You were never the problem.

14:05.675 --> 14:07.274
How many times can I ask you
to save him?

14:07.276 --> 14:09.943
As many times as you need to.

14:10.912 --> 14:12.945
(sobs)

14:18.218 --> 14:19.984
(nell speaks indistinctly
over phone)

14:22.688 --> 14:23.887
All right, thanks, nell.

14:23.889 --> 14:25.788
We'll keep you posted.

14:31.395 --> 14:33.862
You seem close.

14:35.031 --> 14:38.799
I was there for her and joey
when mark was in recovery.

14:39.935 --> 14:42.101
It was tough to see a guy
with so much potential

14:42.103 --> 14:44.169
Go down like that.

14:44.171 --> 14:45.937
(phone rings)

14:45.939 --> 14:47.705
Yeah?

14:47.707 --> 14:49.006
Eric:
Found ruiz.

14:49.008 --> 14:50.207
Or at least his phone.

14:50.209 --> 14:52.142
Location is on its way to you.

14:52.144 --> 14:53.209
(computer chirping)

14:58.915 --> 15:00.414
Ruiz is just to the north.

15:00.416 --> 15:02.015
He's moving.

15:02.017 --> 15:05.218
Either walking really fast
or driving super slow.

15:05.220 --> 15:06.319
Callen:
<i> There he is.</i>

15:13.761 --> 15:15.827
Just me.

15:20.199 --> 15:22.299
Sam:
Mark!

15:24.036 --> 15:25.468
Sam.

15:25.470 --> 15:28.137
Wow.

15:28.139 --> 15:29.938
Something tells me
this isn't a coincidence.

15:29.940 --> 15:31.439
Yeah, uh...

15:31.441 --> 15:33.407
A lot of people looking for you.

15:33.409 --> 15:35.242
Yeah, kinda figured.

15:35.244 --> 15:38.445
Look, the op went south,
I couldn't check in.

15:38.447 --> 15:40.113
I need to stay in play.

15:40.115 --> 15:41.881
Eight o'clock.

15:41.883 --> 15:44.383
Black jacket, gun.

15:44.385 --> 15:45.784
Sam:
I don't see him.

15:45.786 --> 15:47.519
(grunting)

15:47.521 --> 15:49.287
(people exclaiming)

15:49.289 --> 15:51.389
Relax, I've got him.

15:51.391 --> 15:53.858
(grunting)

15:54.360 --> 15:57.094
Woman:
Oh, my god!

15:57.930 --> 15:59.029
(women gasp)

16:04.969 --> 16:07.469
(panting)

16:08.405 --> 16:09.971
(grunts, groans)

16:09.973 --> 16:11.906
That's how you greet
an old friend?

16:11.908 --> 16:13.207
(groans)
huh?

16:13.209 --> 16:14.241
Old partner, maybe.

16:14.243 --> 16:16.209
I don't know about
the friend part.

16:16.211 --> 16:18.311
Don't try to run again.

16:18.313 --> 16:19.278
You only get one pass.

16:19.280 --> 16:21.079
(chuckles):
Okay.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.180
You got me.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.381
I'm done.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.348
I'm not running.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.083
(grunting)

16:26.085 --> 16:27.017
Come on.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.385
Why, you scared?

16:28.387 --> 16:30.286
(grunting)

16:30.288 --> 16:32.254
I'm scared I might
have to hurt you.

16:32.256 --> 16:34.456
That's funny,
that never bothered you before.

16:34.458 --> 16:37.292
Callen:
You boys better stop
before someone loses an eye.

16:40.163 --> 16:42.163
You here to save me again,
sammy?

16:42.165 --> 16:43.364
Big hero.

16:43.366 --> 16:45.432
Nah. This time
I'm here to arrest you.

16:45.434 --> 16:47.167
Turn around.

16:47.169 --> 16:49.335
(handcuffs clicking)

17:01.548 --> 17:03.581
Can't believe
you cuffed me, sammy.

17:03.583 --> 17:06.016
I mean, this is...
This is ridiculous.

17:06.018 --> 17:08.852
Look, I told you to
stop calling me sammy.

17:08.854 --> 17:10.887
Take me back to
the beginning.

17:10.889 --> 17:12.121
Lay it out for me.

17:12.123 --> 17:13.455
A few months ago,

17:13.457 --> 17:16.090
Atf busted two former
cal tech grad students

17:16.092 --> 17:18.459
In west covina
for manufacturing binetex.

17:18.461 --> 17:20.194
Okay.
Atf already knew

17:20.196 --> 17:21.929
That they had sold 50 pounds
of the explosives

17:21.931 --> 17:26.332
To a filipino arms dealer
named ramon santos.

17:27.401 --> 17:30.335
I was able to get in
undercover

17:30.337 --> 17:34.172
As a middleman between
santos and madison's guys.

17:34.174 --> 17:36.407
We set up a buy,
everything was going smoothly

17:36.409 --> 17:37.841
Until the sale went down.

17:37.843 --> 17:39.309
Then... You saw the rest.

17:39.311 --> 17:41.311
Yeah, we did.

17:41.313 --> 17:43.413
Why'd you kill them, mark?

17:43.415 --> 17:45.948
You think I set off the bomb?

17:45.950 --> 17:47.249
We saw your footage.

17:47.251 --> 17:49.084
You keyed your phone,
the building went boom.

17:49.086 --> 17:51.419
I was calling in to atf, man.

17:51.421 --> 17:53.271
Then who detonated the bomb?

17:53.272 --> 17:55.122
My guess, it's the sellers
trying to cover their tracks.

17:55.124 --> 17:56.556
They were already trying
to rip off the buyers.

17:56.558 --> 17:58.424
That's why the whole deal
went bad.

17:59.393 --> 18:01.259
We'll see.

18:01.261 --> 18:03.494
Oh, why take my word for it,
I screwed up.

18:03.496 --> 18:06.029
But never in the field.

18:06.031 --> 18:09.165
What does that count for
anyway?

18:12.336 --> 18:14.302
You know, it's, um...

18:14.304 --> 18:16.337
It's interesting

18:16.339 --> 18:19.273
That you're the one
that doesn't trust me.

18:19.275 --> 18:21.308
Why's that?

18:21.310 --> 18:23.443
(laughs)

18:23.445 --> 18:25.211
Way to play dumb, sam.

18:25.213 --> 18:27.379
Betrayal's your bag, not mine.

18:30.350 --> 18:32.383
Whatever.

18:32.384 --> 18:34.417
Santos still thinks
that I'm an explosives expert.

18:34.420 --> 18:36.453
I still think that I can
get him to make a deal.

18:36.455 --> 18:38.455
But the longer I'm in here,

18:38.456 --> 18:40.456
The more likely it is that the
binetex is going to get sold

18:40.459 --> 18:42.392
And we'll lose
track of it.

18:43.328 --> 18:44.560
Betrayal between
partners.

18:44.562 --> 18:48.029
Things just got real.

18:49.432 --> 18:51.665
Turn off the feed.

18:51.667 --> 18:53.299
But this is getting
interesting.

18:53.301 --> 18:56.168
Turn it off.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.337
Sam:
Turn it off.

19:00.506 --> 19:02.606
You using again?
(groans)

19:02.608 --> 19:05.208
Simple question,
simple answer.

19:06.477 --> 19:10.278
A year ago, I went undercover
with a biker gang

19:10.280 --> 19:12.413
And they forced me to do
cocaine in front of them.

19:12.415 --> 19:15.249
I relapsed, I busted their ass
and I got clean.

19:15.251 --> 19:16.483
A lot of undercover

19:16.485 --> 19:18.518
Assets figure out ways
to fake it, mark.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.386
And a lot of those guys end up
with a bullet in their head

19:20.388 --> 19:21.587
In the mojave.

19:21.589 --> 19:23.422
That's the whole truth

19:23.424 --> 19:25.290
So help me god.

19:25.292 --> 19:27.425
And speaking of truths,

19:27.427 --> 19:30.928
Do you have anything you want
to share with me, sammy?

19:32.131 --> 19:33.497
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

19:46.545 --> 19:49.212
Eric:
We've checked ruiz's cell phone.

19:49.214 --> 19:51.180
Any calls or texts
to his atf handler?

19:51.182 --> 19:52.447
None listed.

19:52.449 --> 19:54.715
Also, if ruiz had a
speed-dial to the number

19:54.717 --> 19:57.084
That detonated the bomb,
it's been deleted.

19:57.086 --> 19:59.586
Could have gone to dial and then
the explosion interrupted him.

19:59.588 --> 20:00.954
Yeah, maybe.

20:00.956 --> 20:03.089
Eric:
Something else.

20:03.091 --> 20:04.390
In the last 20 minutes,
ruiz's cell phone

20:04.392 --> 20:06.425
Received five calls
from the same number.

20:06.427 --> 20:08.126
Looks like a burn phone.

20:08.128 --> 20:09.360
Sam:
Send me the number, eric.

20:09.362 --> 20:12.062
Eric:
You got it.

20:16.368 --> 20:18.000
There's no evidence
on your phone

20:18.002 --> 20:20.535
That you tried
to call atf.

20:20.537 --> 20:23.437
How much money was in that case
you took out of there?

20:23.439 --> 20:25.472
I took it to stay in the game.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.372
No, how much?

20:26.374 --> 20:27.573
Two million.

20:27.575 --> 20:29.274
Come on, sam.

20:29.276 --> 20:31.676
Let me make another deal
with santos.

20:34.147 --> 20:36.046
Whose number is this?

20:36.048 --> 20:38.381
Speak of the devil.

20:38.383 --> 20:41.417
Why is santos calling
a dead man?

20:41.419 --> 20:44.520
He went back for the money,
saw it was gone.

20:44.522 --> 20:46.355
Knew I made it out.

20:46.357 --> 20:48.557
But it's weird.

20:48.559 --> 20:50.992
Santos was never going to sell.

20:50.994 --> 20:54.628
All he brought with him
was a sample.

20:55.597 --> 20:58.030
Maybe that's all he had.

20:58.032 --> 21:01.633
No. Caltech guy said
he bought it all.

21:01.635 --> 21:04.402
You were planning
on returning that money

21:04.404 --> 21:06.604
To the atf evidence locker?

21:06.606 --> 21:09.473
Right?
This is my way in,
sam, okay?

21:09.475 --> 21:13.243
You know how this works--
I got five months in on this op.

21:13.245 --> 21:17.012
Let me reach out to santos
before he changes his mind.

21:19.049 --> 21:20.782
Give me another chance.

21:24.788 --> 21:27.054
(door closes)

21:32.060 --> 21:34.593
I'm going undercover
with ruiz as a new buyer.

21:34.595 --> 21:36.494
Gonna meet with santos,
make a deal.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.796
We'll take him down
when he delivers the binetex.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.430
And you trust ruiz?

21:40.432 --> 21:42.799
I don't.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.567
Deek: Sam,
he might have

21:44.569 --> 21:45.501
Murdered those men.

21:45.503 --> 21:47.402
We haven't confirmed that.

21:47.404 --> 21:49.270
Anybody have a better idea?

21:53.142 --> 21:56.543
Have ruiz call santos,
set it up.

22:03.318 --> 22:05.384
¶ ¶

22:15.462 --> 22:18.162
(camera shutter clicking)

22:24.603 --> 22:26.769
(beeping)

22:26.771 --> 22:28.137
Nell?

22:28.139 --> 22:30.339
Yeah. What do you got?
They're in.

22:30.341 --> 22:33.108
Granger's sending you
photos-- see if you can
I.D. Any of these guys.

22:33.110 --> 22:34.809
This is your new buyer?

22:34.811 --> 22:36.510
Gideon chambiri.

22:36.512 --> 22:37.544
Tanzania.

22:37.546 --> 22:39.679
Santos:
Mr. Tanzania,

22:39.681 --> 22:41.414
You speak english?

22:41.416 --> 22:44.216
(tanzanian accent):
I let the money do the talking.

22:44.218 --> 22:48.486
It's funny, mr. Tanzania,
I have<i> never</i> heard of you.

22:48.488 --> 22:51.155
And I never heard of you.

22:52.658 --> 22:56.159
Ruiz, he says
you have serious money.

22:56.161 --> 22:59.461
$300,000 per pound of binetex.

23:02.132 --> 23:03.498
Thing is...

23:03.500 --> 23:06.601
I do not do
multimillion-dollar deals

23:06.603 --> 23:09.403
While standing in a driveway.

23:09.405 --> 23:12.139
Let us go inside.

23:12.141 --> 23:15.175
Sam (over radio):
Good.

23:20.581 --> 23:22.414
You have my attention.

23:22.416 --> 23:24.549
But first things first.

23:24.551 --> 23:26.751
Where's the $2 million.

23:26.753 --> 23:28.719
Oh, we're talking about a lot
more money than $2 million.

23:28.721 --> 23:30.687
$300,000 a pound?

23:30.689 --> 23:33.322
That's... $15 million.
Look,

23:33.324 --> 23:35.424
I do not know either of you.

23:35.426 --> 23:36.792
You bring me

23:36.794 --> 23:38.760
The $2 million, then we talk.

23:38.762 --> 23:40.211
This is nonsense.

23:40.212 --> 23:41.661
I bring you someone
with real money.

23:41.664 --> 23:44.798
Let's just make a deal--
you get rich, everyone's happy.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.332
The $2 million first.

23:46.334 --> 23:47.633
Okay, show us the product,

23:47.635 --> 23:50.268
And then the $2 million is
a down payment.
No.

23:50.270 --> 23:51.702
No deal.

23:55.274 --> 23:57.841
All right, you win.
We'll go get the money.

23:57.843 --> 23:59.909
Let's go.
Uh-uh-uh.

23:59.911 --> 24:02.645
I do not like strangers
to know where I live.

24:03.648 --> 24:05.781
He will stay.

24:05.783 --> 24:07.616
You go.

24:07.618 --> 24:10.385
This is insane.
Put the guns down.

24:10.387 --> 24:11.886
Get the money.

24:11.888 --> 24:13.454
Maybe I will not

24:13.456 --> 24:14.555
Kill him.

24:14.557 --> 24:16.456
Otherwise...

24:16.458 --> 24:18.624
Maybe I will kill you both.

24:20.861 --> 24:23.494
Why isn't santos
making this deal easy?

24:23.496 --> 24:25.762
Doesn't make sense.

24:25.764 --> 24:27.697
Guys, we ran the photos
through facial rec.

24:27.699 --> 24:30.366
Ramon santos
is not an arms dealer.

24:30.368 --> 24:31.500
His real name

24:31.502 --> 24:33.568
Is amir mattar.

24:34.637 --> 24:36.637
Deeks: He's a member
of the moro islamic

24:36.639 --> 24:38.572
Liberation front based
in southern philippines.

24:38.574 --> 24:41.608
Kensi: And their
terrorist m.O. Of choice

24:41.610 --> 24:43.627
Is car bombs and blowing up

24:43.628 --> 24:45.645
Callen:
Santos doesn't want to sell
government buildings.

24:45.647 --> 24:47.279
Those explosives,
he wants to use them.

24:47.281 --> 24:51.216
And he wants the $2 million
to finance his attack.

24:51.218 --> 24:53.518
Look, I already said that
I was gonna get your money.

24:53.520 --> 24:56.220
Just put down the weapons.

24:56.222 --> 24:58.956
Killing me would
have consequences

24:58.958 --> 25:01.792
You cannot even imagine.

25:01.794 --> 25:04.594
I will take my chances.

25:09.533 --> 25:10.899
(camera shutter clicking)

25:18.975 --> 25:21.642
Sam, you good?

25:21.644 --> 25:23.310
(over radio):
Sam, talk to me.

25:23.312 --> 25:25.211
Just listen to me.

25:25.213 --> 25:26.979
We can work this out.

25:26.981 --> 25:29.448
All right, this is bad.
One of our team should be

25:29.450 --> 25:31.716
In there with sam.
What do we got
on santos' men?

25:31.718 --> 25:34.269
Hold on.

25:34.270 --> 25:36.821
Okay, santos' men are not part
of the moro terrorist group.

25:36.823 --> 25:38.923
They're local hire
filipinos.

25:38.925 --> 25:41.325
Sam, you getting that?
These guys should not be

25:41.327 --> 25:42.659
On the same side.

25:42.661 --> 25:44.293
You gentlemen know

25:44.295 --> 25:48.230
You are working... With a
moro liberation fighter?

25:49.299 --> 25:50.731
Do not listen to him.

25:50.733 --> 25:54.334
This man never wanted
to sell binetex.

25:54.336 --> 25:56.402
He wants to use it

25:56.404 --> 25:57.736
In the philippines.

25:57.738 --> 25:59.805
Shoot him!

25:59.806 --> 26:01.873
He wants to kill
innocent filipinos.

26:01.875 --> 26:03.007
Your people.

26:03.009 --> 26:04.274
I said shoot him!

26:07.912 --> 26:09.244
(panting)

26:09.246 --> 26:10.578
Sam?

26:10.580 --> 26:13.247
Sam: Killing santos
was the right call.

26:13.249 --> 26:14.982
You did not know

26:14.984 --> 26:17.451
You are working with
the moro group?

26:17.453 --> 26:18.952
We suspected...

26:18.954 --> 26:22.855
But we clearly didn't do
our homework.

26:26.460 --> 26:29.627
(speaking tagalog)

26:29.629 --> 26:31.695
(continues
in tagalog)

26:34.966 --> 26:36.298
Do you know what

26:36.300 --> 26:37.399
He is saying?

26:37.401 --> 26:38.833
Granger:
The guy he's speaking to

26:38.835 --> 26:40.968
Is his brother.
He says he should have

26:40.970 --> 26:43.370
Investigated santos.

26:43.372 --> 26:45.972
You know who I am.
Who are you?

26:45.974 --> 26:47.773
Call me diego.

26:47.775 --> 26:50.875
Okay, diego,
do you have the explosives?

26:52.511 --> 26:53.743
Yes.

26:53.745 --> 26:56.478
Sam:
Then my offer stands.

26:58.782 --> 27:00.448
Santos was right.

27:00.450 --> 27:01.882
We don't know you.

27:01.884 --> 27:04.417
But... $2 million.

27:04.419 --> 27:06.352
That'd help us

27:06.354 --> 27:07.820
Feel better about that.

27:07.822 --> 27:10.789
Fine. We'll go get the money.

27:10.791 --> 27:12.056
You have one hour.

27:12.058 --> 27:14.291
You're not back...

27:14.293 --> 27:15.592
We're ghosts.

27:15.594 --> 27:18.328
Then we will move quickly.

27:18.330 --> 27:21.331
This is crazy.
Sam's going undercover

27:21.333 --> 27:23.399
With somebody we barely
know anything about.

27:23.401 --> 27:25.968
You know what?
We should probably
check his file.

27:25.970 --> 27:29.771
I like the way you think
<i>I</i> like the way I think.

27:31.674 --> 27:33.073
(electronic chirping)

27:33.075 --> 27:36.709
Access denied?
Deeks:
Try my password.

27:39.580 --> 27:40.779
Hello, friend.

27:40.781 --> 27:42.097
(gasps)

27:42.098 --> 27:43.414
Yes, hello.
(laughs):
Eric, nell.

27:43.416 --> 27:45.382
Just working here.

27:45.384 --> 27:49.052
Attempting to access mark ruiz's
personnel file, are we?

27:49.054 --> 27:50.586
No.

27:50.588 --> 27:51.553
Can you help us?

27:51.555 --> 27:53.922
Hmm. Just a second. Eric?

27:53.924 --> 27:56.357
Oh, yeah. It says here
that ruiz's history

27:56.359 --> 27:57.991
Is none of
your business.

27:57.993 --> 27:59.359
Oh.

27:59.360 --> 28:00.726
Oh, well, that's really
interesting, 'cause the case

28:00.729 --> 28:02.662
Is about ruiz.

28:02.663 --> 28:04.596
Nell:
Granger has sealed the file.

28:04.599 --> 28:06.332
Stay out of the database,
you guys...

28:06.334 --> 28:09.335
Or granger<i> will</i> fry
your motherboard.

28:09.337 --> 28:10.602
Ncis may be sealed.

28:10.604 --> 28:14.505
But there's a whole lot
more internet out there.

28:29.121 --> 28:31.788
This is the place, huh?
Yeah.

28:39.364 --> 28:42.898
Hey, do me a favor--
let's turn off the
comms for a minute.

28:42.900 --> 28:44.366
Sam:
What's up?

28:44.368 --> 28:45.766
Ruiz:
I just want to talk.

28:49.404 --> 28:50.503
(beeping)

28:52.039 --> 28:54.372
Just had a question for you.

28:54.374 --> 28:56.073
It's been bothering me.

28:56.075 --> 28:57.474
Bring it.

29:00.479 --> 29:02.846
(sighs) back when
I was in rehab...

29:02.848 --> 29:04.414
Which time?

29:04.416 --> 29:05.648
(chuckles)
the first two.

29:07.551 --> 29:11.052
(sighs)
when I was in there...

29:11.054 --> 29:14.488
I know you spent
a lot of time...

29:14.490 --> 29:17.591
At my house.

29:17.593 --> 29:20.026
And you slept with alicia.

29:22.430 --> 29:24.430
Well?

29:26.400 --> 29:29.134
It wasn't a question;
it was a statement.

29:29.136 --> 29:31.736
Well, I'm asking, sammy.

29:31.738 --> 29:33.637
You know there are
ten different reasons

29:33.639 --> 29:35.438
Why that would never happen.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.505
(laughs softly)

29:36.507 --> 29:37.906
Did you?

29:38.909 --> 29:41.776
I did not sleep with her.

29:41.778 --> 29:45.079
Is that what your
little paranoid squirrel
brain needed to hear?

29:51.186 --> 29:53.419
Callen:
Those are diego's men.

29:53.421 --> 29:55.821
Granger: They must have put
a tracker on the car.

29:55.823 --> 29:57.923
Not good.

30:00.127 --> 30:02.160
Come on,
turn those comms back on.

30:02.162 --> 30:05.496
I just needed to ask,
see your reaction.

30:05.498 --> 30:06.997
I was your partner.

30:06.999 --> 30:09.499
I saved your career
a dozen times.

30:09.501 --> 30:11.734
What the hell's
wrong with you?

30:12.870 --> 30:14.436
I'm done.

30:14.438 --> 30:16.204
Is that the money?

30:16.206 --> 30:17.538
Is that the m...

30:17.540 --> 30:19.506
Let's get it over with.

30:20.509 --> 30:22.575
Let's go.

30:34.488 --> 30:36.554
And just for the record--

30:36.556 --> 30:39.590
If it wasn't for promises
I made to alicia and your son,

30:39.592 --> 30:42.592
I would've cut you loose
a long time ago.

30:45.530 --> 30:47.029
This guy's not african.

30:47.031 --> 30:48.530
Callen:
Federal agents!

30:51.501 --> 30:53.033
Callen:
Don't even think about it.

30:53.035 --> 30:55.468
Sam:
Federal agents.
Don't move.

30:57.138 --> 30:59.037
(grunts)

31:03.709 --> 31:04.908
(handcuffs clicking)

31:04.910 --> 31:06.142
What were you doing?

31:06.144 --> 31:08.544
My brother said
just to check them out.

31:08.546 --> 31:11.046
We wanted to make sure
they weren't cops.

31:11.048 --> 31:13.114
You got your answer.

31:13.116 --> 31:14.582
And we got a problem.

31:18.254 --> 31:20.787
I don't think so.

31:20.789 --> 31:22.555
Diego's gonna be

31:22.557 --> 31:25.558
Very worried about this guy.

31:38.238 --> 31:39.637
You got it?
Ruiz:
Yeah.

31:39.639 --> 31:41.038
Come over here, take a look.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.239
Now, before I show you this,

31:42.241 --> 31:44.507
So I know who
I'm dealing with,

31:44.509 --> 31:45.908
You guys blew up
madison, right?

31:45.910 --> 31:48.844
Not us. That was santos.

31:58.221 --> 32:00.221
Where's my brother?

32:00.223 --> 32:01.755
Sam:
He is...

32:01.757 --> 32:03.590
With my people.

32:03.592 --> 32:05.592
You hurt him,
I will hunt you down.

32:05.594 --> 32:06.993
Shut up.

32:06.995 --> 32:09.662
If you do not do
exactly as I say,

32:09.664 --> 32:11.263
I will not only hurt him.

32:11.265 --> 32:13.098
I will kill him.

32:13.100 --> 32:17.635
Now, do you have the binetex?

32:19.238 --> 32:21.238
Yes.
Good.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.240
You are dealing
with me now.

32:23.242 --> 32:26.276
The price has dropped.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.244
$200,000 a pound.

32:28.246 --> 32:30.679
Ten million total.

32:32.015 --> 32:34.582
Send the location.

32:34.584 --> 32:36.717
Kensi:
His name is isko lacan.
He and his brother

32:36.719 --> 32:38.318
Diego were working
drugs, weapons

32:38.320 --> 32:40.019
And prostitution
here in l.A.

32:40.021 --> 32:41.787
All right, got it.

32:41.789 --> 32:44.623
Between ncis and atf,
we put got five million dollars.

32:44.625 --> 32:46.191
Plus the two million from ruiz.

32:46.193 --> 32:48.593
The other three's
just gonna have to be fake.

32:48.595 --> 32:51.295
All right, put
it together.

32:51.297 --> 32:53.630
Okay.

32:53.632 --> 32:55.698
Actually, um,

32:55.700 --> 32:57.866
Just one more thing.

32:57.868 --> 33:01.069
We've been doing
some digging.

33:01.071 --> 33:03.838
Ruiz used his credit card
at a parking meter

33:03.840 --> 33:05.940
Outside a church
every Thursday for three years.

33:05.942 --> 33:07.875
The same church

33:07.877 --> 33:10.310
That a substance abuse
support group was meeting at.

33:10.312 --> 33:11.995
Why didn't you just tell us

33:11.996 --> 33:13.679
That ruiz was washed out
of ncis because of drugs?

33:13.682 --> 33:16.215
Well, I'm not exactly
the office gossip.

33:16.217 --> 33:19.184
Well, it's not gossip if
it's relevant to the case.

33:19.186 --> 33:21.052
If he's clean now, how so?

33:21.054 --> 33:23.354
That's a big if.
It's hard enough

33:23.356 --> 33:26.657
To get clean
without being branded an addict.

33:26.659 --> 33:29.126
Look, I'm not asking
you to trust ruiz.

33:29.128 --> 33:32.896
I'm asking you to trust sam.

33:37.301 --> 33:39.367
Fair enough.

33:40.670 --> 33:42.736
Okay.

33:46.641 --> 33:48.741
(phone ringing through)

33:48.743 --> 33:50.709
Man:
Yes, sir.

33:50.711 --> 33:52.343
Is the tac team ready?
Man:
Yes, sir.

33:52.345 --> 33:54.678
All right, stand by.

33:56.048 --> 33:59.949
(gasping and wheezing)

33:59.951 --> 34:03.685
(grunting)

34:04.087 --> 34:05.653
(grunts)

34:15.797 --> 34:18.998
He's dead. You okay?
Uh-huh.

34:23.137 --> 34:25.203
There's been a complication.

34:39.919 --> 34:43.320
Put most of the real bills
on top, then mix in the rest.

34:43.322 --> 34:45.188
Pray they can't tell
the difference.

34:45.190 --> 34:47.089
You really think
we're gonna get that far

34:47.091 --> 34:49.124
Without diego's brother?

34:49.126 --> 34:51.659
You had to shoot him?

34:53.729 --> 34:55.995
You don't trust
that I did the right thing?

34:55.997 --> 34:59.864
Because I sure as hell have
been trusting you, agent hanna.

35:02.935 --> 35:04.801
Yes, you have.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.803
I have an idea.

35:07.806 --> 35:10.439
Sam, remember rosarito?

35:12.409 --> 35:16.043
Yeah. That could work.

35:19.782 --> 35:22.382
Gonna head out in a few.
I'm riding point with atf.

35:23.752 --> 35:25.151
Is that ruiz's file?

35:25.153 --> 35:26.685
Yeah.

35:26.687 --> 35:28.687
Trying to decide

35:28.689 --> 35:31.189
Whether I can trust him.

35:31.191 --> 35:34.325
Yeah. Jury's still out with me.

35:34.327 --> 35:35.793
Your partner trusts him.

35:35.795 --> 35:38.829
Well, sam's loyal to a fault.

35:38.831 --> 35:40.997
Sometimes it blinds him.

35:44.902 --> 35:48.703
Agent ruiz was running
an undercover op for me

35:48.705 --> 35:51.105
In the province of kunar.

35:51.107 --> 35:55.775
Sam and a group of seals
were providing support.

35:55.777 --> 35:58.110
They were ambushed.

35:58.112 --> 36:00.112
The cost

36:00.114 --> 36:03.115
Was the lives of two men
from sam's seal team.

36:03.117 --> 36:05.117
Ruiz lived

36:05.119 --> 36:08.420
While sam's brothers died.

36:08.422 --> 36:10.221
Sam always wanted to believe

36:10.223 --> 36:13.090
That ruiz's life
was worth the cost.

36:13.092 --> 36:16.793
Even when ruiz didn't
believe it himself.

36:16.795 --> 36:19.095
I'll have my partner's back.

36:19.097 --> 36:20.996
Good.

36:49.326 --> 36:52.026
¶ ¶

37:03.538 --> 37:05.971
Give me my brother.

37:05.973 --> 37:07.539
We brought the money.

37:07.541 --> 37:09.173
Let us see the product.

37:14.046 --> 37:16.179
Isko?

37:16.181 --> 37:18.347
(grunting)

37:18.349 --> 37:19.881
Sam:
I need to see

37:19.883 --> 37:22.083
The explosives now.

37:23.052 --> 37:25.152
Open it.

37:50.211 --> 37:52.277
(hissing)

37:55.148 --> 37:57.014
It's good. Let's do this.

37:57.016 --> 37:58.949
Granger:
Execute. Execute.

38:01.420 --> 38:03.186
(tires squealing, siren toots)

38:03.188 --> 38:06.155
Man (over p.A.):
Federal agents!
Lay down your weapons.

38:06.157 --> 38:08.223
Put your hands in the air.

38:09.259 --> 38:10.424
Move, and you die.

38:11.560 --> 38:13.459
(grunts)

38:13.461 --> 38:15.260
Man:
Atf! Don't move!

38:15.262 --> 38:16.294
On you knees!

38:16.296 --> 38:18.262
On the ground! Down! Knees!

38:18.264 --> 38:20.197
Down on your knees!
Down! Now!

38:20.199 --> 38:21.198
Man:
Coppers.
Stay right where you are.

38:21.200 --> 38:23.066
Hands on your head!

38:29.340 --> 38:31.139
Who's got eyes on sam?

38:31.141 --> 38:33.207
Anyone?

38:33.209 --> 38:34.274
Deeks:
I got nothing.

38:34.276 --> 38:36.342
What about ruiz?

39:17.251 --> 39:19.251
So you finally learned
to shoot, huh?

39:19.253 --> 39:21.319
(ruiz gasping)

39:22.588 --> 39:24.955
(grunting)

39:24.957 --> 39:27.924
Eric, nell, I need an ambulance.
I have an agent down!

39:27.926 --> 39:29.258
Eric:
On it.

39:29.260 --> 39:30.259
(grunting)

39:30.261 --> 39:33.195
Oh, that... (laughs)

39:33.197 --> 39:34.563
That's a lot of blood.

39:34.565 --> 39:36.464
You're fine.
(groans)

39:36.466 --> 39:38.566
Eric, what's the eta
on that ambulance?

39:38.568 --> 39:41.001
Eight minutes out.

39:41.003 --> 39:42.235
(groaning)

39:42.237 --> 39:44.170
(groaning)

39:44.172 --> 39:46.005
Hang in there, buddy.
Hang in there.

39:46.007 --> 39:48.640
Right... Right...
You'll be okay. Yeah.

39:48.642 --> 39:51.376
(sirens approaching)

39:57.183 --> 39:59.249
(indistinct voice over p.A.)

40:05.089 --> 40:06.955
Hi.

40:06.957 --> 40:10.959
So, doctor say there's only
minor internal bleeding.

40:10.961 --> 40:14.329
They'll take you up to
surgery in a few minutes.

40:14.331 --> 40:16.431
This time, I saved you.

40:16.433 --> 40:19.100
I was wondering how
long it was gonna be

40:19.102 --> 40:21.102
Before you brought that up.

40:21.104 --> 40:22.937
(laughs)

40:22.939 --> 40:24.371
Payback's a bitch.

40:24.373 --> 40:26.506
Yeah, it is.

40:29.043 --> 40:31.209
We're even.

40:31.211 --> 40:34.679
I could save you ten times,

40:34.681 --> 40:37.181
And we wouldn't be even.

40:37.183 --> 40:39.249
You hear me?

40:44.021 --> 40:46.387
Thanks, brother.

40:48.624 --> 40:50.223
Hey.

40:53.528 --> 40:57.329
Hey, joey, come here.

41:04.571 --> 41:07.371
Your daddy saved my life.

41:07.373 --> 41:09.473
He's a hero.

41:15.313 --> 41:18.080
Hey. How you doing?

41:18.082 --> 41:20.982
He's gonna be fine.

41:20.984 --> 41:23.049
Thank god.

41:25.686 --> 41:27.752
Thank you.

41:31.390 --> 41:34.324
Hey.

41:38.463 --> 41:42.765
You came back.

41:42.767 --> 41:45.267
Uh, yeah, I got some work done
while mark was in surgery.

41:45.269 --> 41:47.402
They just took him to recovery.

41:47.404 --> 41:48.603
How's he doing?
Looks like

41:48.605 --> 41:49.770
He's gonna be okay.

41:49.772 --> 41:51.238
Good.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.606
How's your tummy?

41:52.608 --> 41:54.708
I didn't hit you
too hard, did I?

41:54.710 --> 41:56.576
Well, I can't keep
solid food down,

41:56.578 --> 41:58.477
But other than that,
I'm top notch.

41:58.479 --> 42:00.479
Well, if you did
some more sit-ups...

42:00.481 --> 42:03.248
Oh. Yes, so nice to have
a partner who cares.

42:03.250 --> 42:13.358
You know I love you, g.
And I love you, too... Sammy.

42:13.360 --> 42:18.796
You know I love you, g.
And I love you, too... Sammy.
