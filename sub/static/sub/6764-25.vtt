01:38.064 --> 01:39.725
All you gotta do
is go up to Nat and say,

01:39.899 --> 01:41.958
"Nat, look, I've been coming here
a long time,

01:42.135 --> 01:46.128
and I gotta tell you, as a friend,
you gotta update the jukebox.

01:46.306 --> 01:48.672
This music is...
It's out of a time warp. "

01:48.842 --> 01:51.333
- Well, I don't think it's gonna work.
- Of course it will work.

01:51.511 --> 01:53.570
All you gotta do is act sincere
when you talk to Nat.

01:53.746 --> 01:55.179
He loves that stuff.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.307
Steve.

01:58.485 --> 02:01.181
Tell him that none of us
can relate to this music anymore.

02:01.354 --> 02:04.118
Well, I don't think now would be
the best time to tell Nat about this.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.314
Why not?

02:13.099 --> 02:14.964
- Hi, Nat.
- Hi.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.194
You really like
listening to this music, huh?

02:17.370 --> 02:20.032
Like I always say,
if you can remember the '60s...

02:20.206 --> 02:21.798
I had a feeling
he was gonna say that.

02:24.210 --> 02:27.202
Donna, I cannot go to Mammoth.
I have a lot of reading to do.

02:27.380 --> 02:28.870
So you can take all your books.

02:29.048 --> 02:31.175
Bren, we had fun
going down the slopes in Big Bear.

02:31.351 --> 02:34.650
You had fun.
I was on my butt the whole time.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.381
- Oh, wait till you try it.
- And she will.

02:37.557 --> 02:40.754
Yeah, I said I'd probably go
if it's not too cold.

02:40.927 --> 02:42.758
It won't be,
and so even if we don't go skiing,

02:42.929 --> 02:45.955
they have all these natural hot springs,
great restaurants, it'll be fun.

02:46.132 --> 02:48.532
Hey, I'm not the one
trying to get my deposit back.

02:48.701 --> 02:50.862
Seriously, Bren, I mean,
if I can take a week

02:51.037 --> 02:52.766
and not go surfing
and go out with you guys,

02:52.939 --> 02:54.531
you cannot pull out
this late in the game.

02:54.707 --> 02:55.799
Look, I wanna go.

02:55.975 --> 02:58.603
- So go.
- I can't.

02:58.778 --> 02:59.802
What, you can't?

02:59.979 --> 03:01.844
What do you mean, you can't?
Are you grounded?

03:02.015 --> 03:03.812
No, not technically,
but my parents wanna know

03:03.983 --> 03:06.679
when I'm finally gonna learn
how to set limits for myself.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.720
Can't you tell them you'll do that
after you're back from spring break?

03:09.889 --> 03:12.153
Yeah, tell them you need a weekend
away with your friends

03:12.325 --> 03:13.758
and we'll straighten you out.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.258
You want me to talk to them?

03:15.428 --> 03:18.022
No, I'm just gonna stay here.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.265
Hello.

03:29.442 --> 03:30.534
Oh, hi, Donna.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.803
Yeah, I picked up my skis,
they're waxed, I'm psyched.

03:32.979 --> 03:34.537
How about you?

03:36.616 --> 03:38.106
I hear you.

03:38.284 --> 03:41.344
Let me see what I can do. Bye.

03:42.989 --> 03:44.854
- Who was that?
- That was Donna.

03:45.024 --> 03:46.958
She was wondering
if there's anything she could do

03:47.126 --> 03:49.287
to help change your mind
about Brenda and the ski trip.

03:49.462 --> 03:51.054
What about Brenda and the ski trip?

03:51.231 --> 03:52.789
You mean she's not grounded?

03:54.300 --> 03:56.234
- No.
- No.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.162
Hi, guys.

03:59.806 --> 04:02.673
- How are you doing?
- Apparently, better than you.

04:02.842 --> 04:05.140
Yeah, we're sorry to hear
you got grounded.

04:06.346 --> 04:07.472
Who called?

04:07.647 --> 04:09.137
Donna.

04:09.849 --> 04:11.578
Look, I'm sorry.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.946
I got backed into a corner,
I needed an excuse.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.178
You were the first thing
that popped into my head.

04:16.356 --> 04:17.550
Would you like to be grounded?

04:17.724 --> 04:18.748
I don't care.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.791
As long as I don't have to go
skiing again.

04:31.571 --> 04:33.163
You know,
in the time that we lived here,

04:33.339 --> 04:35.739
this bench
has become completely warped.

04:35.908 --> 04:38.103
I think
you've become completely warped.

04:39.078 --> 04:41.808
Brenda,
just answer me one question.

04:41.981 --> 04:43.778
What am I supposed to say
to all our friends

04:43.950 --> 04:46.544
when we're riding up on the chair lift
and they ask me,

04:46.719 --> 04:49.745
"What's wrong with Brenda?
How come she flaked on us?"

04:49.922 --> 04:53.119
What am I supposed to say?
"Oh, don't worry about Brenda.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.386
Sure, she lied through her teeth
about being grounded,

04:55.561 --> 04:57.859
but she only did it
to spare your feelings. "

04:58.431 --> 05:01.059
Well, you could tell them
that I am grounded.

05:01.701 --> 05:03.635
Why don't you
tell them that yourself?

05:05.772 --> 05:07.000
Brandon.

05:09.108 --> 05:12.635
Please don't be mad at me.
I'm going through a lot of stuff now.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.643
You're always going through
some stuff, Brenda,

05:14.847 --> 05:17.247
and you're always going to extremes.
You know what I'm saying?

05:17.417 --> 05:18.907
Now, I don't know
about everybody else,

05:19.085 --> 05:21.485
but I'm getting real tired
of dealing with it.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.820
Yeah, I'm getting pretty tired
of dealing with it too.

05:27.193 --> 05:29.252
Have fun in Mammoth.

05:43.643 --> 05:44.667
Good morning.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.108
Oh, I was just writing you a note,
but now that you're up,

05:47.280 --> 05:49.976
you have one last chance
to come to the swap meet with us.

05:50.149 --> 05:52.879
- Where is it again?
- Pasadena, the Rose Bowl.

05:53.052 --> 05:55.213
- You and Daddy go.
- Oh, come on.

05:55.388 --> 05:58.221
You know, all I really wanna do
is go for a bike ride, take a bath,

05:58.791 --> 06:01.351
try and find something good to read.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.222
Just try not to think too much.

06:05.064 --> 06:06.895
Okay.

07:11.030 --> 07:15.558
<i>Dear Diary, when I was 10 years old,
I made a vow never to keep a diary.</i>

07:15.735 --> 07:18.101
<i>I mean, is there anything more '50s
and repressed</i>

07:18.271 --> 07:20.171
<i>than pouring your heart
to some little black book</i>

07:20.339 --> 07:22.239
<i>you hide under your mattress?</i>

07:22.408 --> 07:26.174
<i>But the times, they are a-changing,
and we all need somebody to love.</i>

07:26.345 --> 07:28.313
<i>So hello, Diary, I'm Wendy,</i>

07:28.481 --> 07:31.041
<i>and my New Year's resolution
is not to be so uptight.</i>

07:31.217 --> 07:34.118
<i>And make 1968
the best year of my life.</i>

07:34.287 --> 07:37.381
<i>January 2nd.
Went to the Peach Pit last night.</i>

07:37.557 --> 07:40.424
<i>Got in a fight with Peter.
Got in a fight with Will.</i>

07:40.593 --> 07:42.117
<i>Got in a fight with Michelle.</i>

07:42.295 --> 07:44.820
<i>Are we starting to see a pattern here,
Diary?</i>

07:44.997 --> 07:47.898
<i>The truth is,
my friends don't understand me at all.</i>

07:48.067 --> 07:50.695
Brenda?

07:50.870 --> 07:51.894
We're off.

07:52.104 --> 07:54.766
Mom, you will not believe what I found
underneath the window seat.

07:55.908 --> 07:57.808
We won't be late. Love you.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.569
Bye.

08:03.683 --> 08:06.516
<i>Dear Diary,
I wonder if any future historians</i>

08:06.686 --> 08:09.120
<i>will trace the fall
of Western civilization</i>

08:09.288 --> 08:12.689
<i>to the moment my parents started
watching the Vietnam War for dinner.</i>

08:12.859 --> 08:14.156
<i>I mean, my family has always been</i>

08:14.327 --> 08:17.296
<i>one part Father Knows Best,
one part Twilight Zone.</i>

08:17.463 --> 08:19.192
<i>I can't describe what it's like
to sit there,</i>

08:19.365 --> 08:21.492
<i>watching the Tet Offensive
night after night,</i>

08:21.667 --> 08:24.693
<i>while we eat our TV dinners
in total silence.</i>

08:25.505 --> 08:28.440
<i>And no one says anything
to anyone</i>

08:28.608 --> 08:30.132
<i>until there's a commercial.</i>

08:30.309 --> 08:35.076
The communists have definitely
infiltrated the antiwar movement.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.716
<i>My brother Will is a little to the right
of Attila the Hun.</i>

08:37.884 --> 08:39.249
<i>He always has to talk first.</i>

08:40.253 --> 08:44.121
And you can bet they're dancing
in the streets in Moscow and Hanoi.

08:44.690 --> 08:47.557
<i>Although I usually disagree
with his political pronouncements,</i>

08:47.727 --> 08:49.058
<i>I hardly ever say anything,</i>

08:49.228 --> 08:51.253
<i>because I hate it
when he and Daddy gang up on me.</i>

08:51.430 --> 08:54.331
If that's what you honestly believe,
you don't know anything.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.730
You're naive.
You live in an ivory tower.

08:56.903 --> 08:58.530
Tell her, Dad.

08:58.704 --> 09:01.400
She's naive.
She lives in an ivory tower.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.708
The gravy on this turkey is different,
isn't it?

09:07.880 --> 09:09.541
<i>- It's new and improved.
- Groovy.</i>

09:09.715 --> 09:11.979
<i>- Far-out.
- Fantastic.</i>

09:12.151 --> 09:15.052
<i>It's going to take courage to tell them.</i>

09:20.359 --> 09:21.883
<i>March 31 st.</i>

09:22.061 --> 09:24.962
<i>Dear Diary, if any of your friends
ever wanna know</i>

09:25.131 --> 09:27.497
<i>what the generation gap
is all about,</i>

09:27.667 --> 09:30.602
<i>just send them to my house
for 15 minutes.</i>

09:30.770 --> 09:32.829
<i>There we were, with our TV dinners,</i>

09:33.005 --> 09:37.101
<i>watching LBJ assuring all of us
that we were winning the war in Asia,</i>

09:37.276 --> 09:39.676
<i>when all hell broke loose.</i>

09:39.845 --> 09:42.609
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it. It's probably for me.

09:43.783 --> 09:46.980
If that's who I think it is,
tell him to get a haircut.

09:50.056 --> 09:51.990
- Hey, what's happening?
- We're still eating.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.149
You weren't supposed
to pick me up until they left.

09:55.194 --> 09:58.925
Well, time has become
an irrelevant concept to me, I'm sorry.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.929
Wendy, who's out there?

10:01.100 --> 10:03.591
Oh, it's Ho Chi Minh, Dr. Edwards.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.536
Wendy, would you come here,
please?

10:06.806 --> 10:08.569
Give me a second.

10:10.876 --> 10:12.434
Yeah.

10:12.612 --> 10:17.481
<i>With America's future under challenge
right here at home.</i>

10:17.883 --> 10:19.316
I thought we made it perfectly clear

10:19.485 --> 10:21.453
that Peter Brinkley is not allowed
in this house.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.749
He's not in the house, Daddy.
He's outside by his van.

10:25.691 --> 10:26.988
Thanks for dinner, Mom.

10:27.159 --> 10:28.956
- Where are you going?
- To the library.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.527
Not dressed like that, you're not.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.960
Since when did we start
letting her wear miniskirts?

10:33.132 --> 10:34.156
I won't be home late.

10:34.333 --> 10:35.357
That's right, you won't,

10:35.534 --> 10:37.468
because you're not going
with that crumbum.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.731
Peter is a serious thinker, Daddy.
You just don't like his politics.

10:40.906 --> 10:43.033
I don't like him. He's a crumbum.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.642
He is not a crumbum.

10:44.810 --> 10:47.404
Honey, I think
you might wanna listen to this.

10:47.913 --> 10:49.642
Oh, man, Rowan and Martin
are so much funnier

10:49.815 --> 10:50.941
than the Smothers Brothers.

10:51.117 --> 10:53.608
Especially when Goldie goes,
"Sock it to me, sock it to me. "

10:53.786 --> 10:55.981
I like that part
when Sammy Davis Jr. Comes down.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.816
<i>Here comes the judge
Here comes the judge</i>

10:57.990 --> 11:00.823
- You know me.
- You know me.

11:01.594 --> 11:04.028
Commander in Chief will resign
and these guys are doing jokes

11:04.196 --> 11:05.686
from a television show.

11:05.865 --> 11:07.355
My Natale's the same.

11:07.533 --> 11:09.967
Oh, yeah, he got two lines
in a Glenn Ford movie,

11:10.136 --> 11:11.865
now he's too big
to work here anymore.

11:12.038 --> 11:14.598
Well, you know, Sal,
with LBJ out of the picture,

11:14.774 --> 11:16.435
there's gonna be a shakeup
at the Pentagon.

11:16.609 --> 11:18.975
Who knows, we might have this thing
won by Christmas.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.079
That'd be great.

11:22.481 --> 11:27.248
That's a good boy,
not like the rest of these son of a...

11:30.690 --> 11:32.988
Why don't you guys go sit down?
I'm gonna change the music.

11:33.159 --> 11:34.183
It's so crowded.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.295
Oh, Maryanne Bagley
from the Alpha House just walked in.

11:37.463 --> 11:41.263
- Maryanne Bagley is a prude.
- Oh, but she's so fine.

11:41.434 --> 11:44.562
Just go make a move.
You know what you gotta do to score.

11:44.737 --> 11:45.965
I do?

11:46.138 --> 11:47.969
<i>Oh, Seth, come on.
You read Playboy, don't you?</i>

11:48.140 --> 11:51.735
We're living in the middle
of a sexual revolution here, big guy.

11:51.911 --> 11:54.038
The chicks dig it
almost as much as guys do.

11:54.213 --> 11:57.774
We just have to help them
get into the right frame of mind.

11:58.751 --> 12:00.844
Go ask her what sign she is.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.317
What sign?

12:04.123 --> 12:06.148
That's how Hefner does it.

12:06.926 --> 12:08.723
Right.

12:11.964 --> 12:15.092
- Hi, Maryanne.
- Yes, Seth?

12:15.601 --> 12:17.831
So, what's your sign?

12:18.003 --> 12:19.300
Oh, well, this one says,

12:19.472 --> 12:22.669
"War is not healthy for children
and other living things. "

12:22.842 --> 12:25.333
And this one says,
"Vote for Bobby. "

12:25.511 --> 12:27.308
Pretty groovy, huh?

12:27.847 --> 12:29.610
Yeah.

12:30.950 --> 12:32.884
You were collecting signatures
for Bobby Kennedy

12:33.052 --> 12:35.612
at a Simon and Garfunkel concert?

12:35.788 --> 12:38.552
Yeah, we want him to get on the ballot
in time for the primary.

12:38.724 --> 12:39.748
Why?

12:39.925 --> 12:43.725
Well, so he can get elected president
and end this stinking war, that's why.

12:43.896 --> 12:46.524
Excuse me, I was having
a conversation with my sister.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.667
Now, what were you saying
about Bobby Kennedy?

12:48.834 --> 12:51.769
I was saying we want him
to end this stinking war.

12:52.171 --> 12:55.436
"You don't have to be a weatherman
to know which way the wind blows. "

12:55.608 --> 12:58.133
Time has come for a change
and something's happening.

12:58.811 --> 13:00.073
I'll tell you what's happening.

13:00.813 --> 13:04.305
What's happening
is you're out of here, all of you.

13:04.483 --> 13:06.576
Nobody gonna make a hippie joint
out of my diner.

13:07.486 --> 13:10.819
You tell him, Sallie.
Love it or leave it.

13:10.990 --> 13:13.322
- I say we leave it.
- I say we boycott.

13:13.492 --> 13:16.052
You just violated our civil rights,
Mr. Bussichio.

13:16.228 --> 13:18.253
Oh, yeah?

13:18.430 --> 13:21.058
Well, you just violated my stomach.

13:21.233 --> 13:22.860
And to show you
I got no hard feelings,

13:23.035 --> 13:27.404
Will, get him the record to take,
so I don't gotta hear no more.

13:28.707 --> 13:31.107
Now get out of here, all of you!

13:32.378 --> 13:35.040
You keep your record, man.
You keep your stinking jukebox.

13:35.214 --> 13:37.705
Come on, let's go.

13:42.788 --> 13:44.756
Will, I'm sorry.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.423
You're not gonna tell Mom and Dad,
are you?

13:51.430 --> 13:52.920
<i>After that night,
I knew that nothing</i>

13:53.098 --> 13:55.931
<i>would ever be the same
between me and my brother again.</i>

13:56.101 --> 13:57.432
<i>Hell, after that night,</i>

13:57.603 --> 14:00.163
<i>nothing would be the same
for anybody again.</i>

14:00.806 --> 14:04.503
<i>Dear Diary, I know I promised
to drop you a note every day,</i>

14:04.677 --> 14:07.305
<i>but the last two weeks
have been insane.</i>

14:07.479 --> 14:09.140
<i>The California primary is tomorrow.</i>

14:09.315 --> 14:11.340
<i>When the polls close,
a lot of the volunteers</i>

14:11.517 --> 14:14.213
<i>are going down to Rancho Park
for a private victory celebration</i>

14:14.386 --> 14:17.184
<i>before heading over to
the Ambassador Hotel to see Bobby.</i>

14:17.356 --> 14:21.349
<i>Peter says the world will be watching
what happens in California.</i>

14:21.527 --> 14:23.654
<i>Peter has started going out
with Michelle.</i>

14:23.829 --> 14:25.194
<i>They're sleeping together.</i>

14:25.364 --> 14:27.832
<i>They're talking about
living together someday.</i>

14:28.000 --> 14:31.060
<i>Is it any wonder
why I have a broken heart?</i>

14:34.707 --> 14:37.904
You know, this tree has been here
longer than the missionaries.

14:38.077 --> 14:39.601
I mean,
it was here before Warner Bros.

14:39.778 --> 14:44.738
I bet you if we cut it open, it would tell
the story of this planet in its rings.

14:44.917 --> 14:48.375
Peter, this is a sycamore tree.
It's not a sequoia.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.385
It's probably
not more than 30 years old.

14:50.956 --> 14:53.288
You really can't trust anything
over 30.

14:54.326 --> 14:58.524
Well, maybe we could strip the bark
and roll it up and smoke it.

14:58.697 --> 15:01.131
That would be really trippy.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.631
I got a lighter.

15:03.369 --> 15:04.961
Well, I have a joint.

15:05.137 --> 15:06.331
Is that real?

15:06.505 --> 15:07.904
Acapulco gold.

15:08.073 --> 15:11.440
Let's try it.
Come on, just this once, please.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.040
You heard the lady. Light her up.

15:16.215 --> 15:18.445
I don't think this is a good idea.

15:19.184 --> 15:20.879
I'll go talk to her.

15:22.488 --> 15:25.582
She's probably just worried
about getting busted.

15:25.758 --> 15:29.023
- Hey, Wendy, come on, I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

15:29.194 --> 15:32.595
It's just, you know,
if I'm near it, I'll wanna try it.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.733
Well, it's okay.
Just, you know, take one hit.

15:34.900 --> 15:37.562
That's all I'm gonna do.
You don't even have to inhale.

15:37.736 --> 15:39.397
Knowing me,
I'd probably just flip out.

15:39.571 --> 15:41.732
I'll see you at the victory party.

15:43.609 --> 15:47.511
You scared me. What's wrong?

15:48.180 --> 15:50.045
Robert Kennedy has been shot.

15:58.824 --> 16:01.349
So can I interest you
in a piece of pie?

16:01.527 --> 16:02.551
Oh, please, I'm stuffed.

16:02.728 --> 16:06.220
I couldn't put another morsel of food
in my mouth.

16:06.398 --> 16:10.300
Well, unless, of course,
the baby wants some.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.571
- Hi, Bren.
- Hello, Natale.

16:13.739 --> 16:14.797
Natale?

16:15.507 --> 16:17.771
<i>That was your billing in
Fate is the Hunter. Did you know</i>

16:17.943 --> 16:20.207
- Nat was in a Glenn Ford movie?
- No.

16:20.379 --> 16:22.279
What, have you been picking through
the archives?

16:22.448 --> 16:24.040
Better than that. I found this old diary

16:24.216 --> 16:26.207
from a girl who used to hang out here
in the 1960s.

16:26.385 --> 16:27.647
Let me see.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.845
- Who is she?
- Wendy Edwards.

16:30.022 --> 16:32.252
Her brother Will worked here
in the spring of '68.

16:32.424 --> 16:35.325
Oh, yeah. I remember him.

16:35.494 --> 16:36.518
I think.

16:36.695 --> 16:39.892
Look at these numbers,
134, ten, 66, 72...

16:40.065 --> 16:42.556
Hey, no fair, peeking.
You have to read a diary in sequence.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.761
Sorry, it looks like a code to me.

16:45.938 --> 16:48.805
Well, all I know is that
Wendy Edwards went to CU,

16:48.974 --> 16:51.135
she grew up in my house
and lived in my room.

16:51.310 --> 16:52.937
Really? That's wild.

16:53.112 --> 16:55.808
Yeah, I feel kind of weird, though,
like I'm invading her privacy.

16:55.981 --> 16:58.176
I mean, this is her personal diary.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.285
Well, I bet you could track
the real Wendy down

17:01.453 --> 17:03.250
at the Registrar's Office.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.913
Well, actually, I was thinking
of going to the research library,

17:06.090 --> 17:07.955
looking her up
in an old yearbook or something.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.357
- That sounds like a plan.
- Good.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.622
Is that the original jukebox?

17:12.798 --> 17:14.595
I don't know.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.060
Which one of these guys is Sal?

17:20.539 --> 17:22.404
The one under the clock.

17:25.644 --> 17:27.737
Not at all like I pictured him.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.120
- Any luck?
- I'm sorry.

17:38.290 --> 17:39.314
Just as I suspected.

17:39.491 --> 17:42.551
We haven't transferred
the student yearbooks to microfilm yet.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.821
You're gonna have to go up
to the sixth floor

17:44.997 --> 17:46.931
and see what we have in the stacks.

17:47.099 --> 17:48.464
Thanks.

17:48.634 --> 17:50.363
What years are you looking for?

17:51.603 --> 17:55.972
Well, she probably would've graduated
in 1969, if she graduated at all.

17:56.141 --> 17:58.336
Didn't a lot of kids
take time off back then

17:58.510 --> 18:00.068
to get their heads together?

18:00.245 --> 18:03.510
"Tune in, turn on and drop out. "

18:04.116 --> 18:05.549
Where were you
during those years?

18:05.717 --> 18:09.414
Well, I was in junior high,
but I did come here

18:09.588 --> 18:12.557
for the big hippie Be-In
that was going on in the main quad.

18:13.058 --> 18:15.026
When was that?

18:15.194 --> 18:18.186
March 31 st, 1969.

18:18.664 --> 18:21.633
One year after Lyndon Johnson
announced his resignation.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.597
That's right.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.262
Here it is.

18:26.438 --> 18:29.839
This is what Wendy Edwards had
to say about the great hippie Be-In.

18:33.512 --> 18:34.911
<i>Dear Diary,</i>

18:35.080 --> 18:38.277
<i>I honestly don't think
I was cut out to be a hippie.</i>

18:39.251 --> 18:42.743
<i>I don't get high.
I despise acid rock.</i>

18:42.921 --> 18:45.185
<i>And I don't think there's
anything particularly liberating</i>

18:45.357 --> 18:47.450
<i>about growing hair
under my armpits.</i>

18:47.626 --> 18:48.786
<i>Having said that,</i>

18:48.961 --> 18:52.021
<i>let me say that the Be-In
was definitely a cosmic happening,</i>

18:52.197 --> 18:54.961
<i>especially if you were a dog.</i>

18:58.203 --> 18:59.898
<i>Or Michelle.</i>

19:00.072 --> 19:04.441
<i>I can't help it.
I look at her and I wanna be her.</i>

19:04.610 --> 19:07.443
<i>I wanna be the one
playing the tambourine.</i>

19:11.650 --> 19:14.141
Lovely. Guys, excellent job.
Ladies and gentlemen...

19:14.319 --> 19:16.981
<i>Or standing next to Peter
when he's there doing what he can</i>

19:17.156 --> 19:19.090
<i>to raise everyone's consciousness
about the war.</i>

19:20.259 --> 19:21.783
<i>Did I say everyone?</i>

19:21.960 --> 19:24.520
<i>What I should have said
is everyone but one.</i>

19:25.430 --> 19:28.331
Will, don't take this the wrong way,
but I don't know,

19:28.500 --> 19:30.991
a lot of chicks don't respond to a guy
who comes to a love-in

19:31.170 --> 19:34.230
dressed in an ROTC uniform.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.037
He's blowing it.

19:36.208 --> 19:38.574
Yeah, right on.
That's what I wanna hear.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.439
You know, I know
it's a rhetorical question,

19:40.612 --> 19:42.102
but, hey, somebody had to ask it.

19:42.281 --> 19:44.078
The real question is,
do you people believe

19:44.249 --> 19:47.343
in the Constitution
of the United States of America?

19:47.519 --> 19:49.111
Oh, this man has been brainwashed,
people,

19:49.288 --> 19:51.779
by the military-industrial complex.

19:51.957 --> 19:54.187
Do you believe
that freedom is worth fighting for?

19:54.359 --> 19:55.917
Worth dying for?

19:56.094 --> 19:57.118
Listen to that.

19:57.296 --> 19:59.059
He's ready to drop napalm
on the Mekong Delta.

19:59.231 --> 20:01.791
Forget the lies they've been telling you
about the war in Vietnam.

20:01.967 --> 20:04.959
It is legal, it is moral
and it is winnable.

20:05.137 --> 20:09.005
Do the words My Lai massacre
mean anything to you, officer, huh?

20:10.275 --> 20:11.640
<i>By the time I got up to the podium,</i>

20:11.810 --> 20:14.540
<i>Peter and Will were engaged
in mortal combat.</i>

20:14.713 --> 20:16.943
<i>They'd probably still be at it
if Michelle hadn't lost it</i>

20:17.115 --> 20:19.015
<i>right in front
of the whole damn Be-In.</i>

20:19.184 --> 20:20.412
<i>I mean, she just fell apart,</i>

20:20.586 --> 20:23.646
<i>said she couldn't handle
the bad vibes, so Peter called it quits.</i>

20:23.822 --> 20:26.120
<i>But first, he made a point of calling
my brother a fascist,</i>

20:26.291 --> 20:28.452
<i>who, in turn, call Peter a traitor.</i>

20:28.827 --> 20:32.263
<i>And then they glared at each other,
and then they glared at me.</i>

20:32.431 --> 20:34.023
Peace.

20:34.199 --> 20:35.826
<i>And then
they went their separate ways.</i>

20:36.001 --> 20:37.593
Peace.

20:54.086 --> 20:57.249
"Sometimes it's hard to believe
they were ever best friends. "

20:57.422 --> 20:59.322
Boy, that's powerful stuff.

21:00.025 --> 21:01.959
Yeah, it's all like that.

21:02.127 --> 21:03.321
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

21:03.495 --> 21:05.190
<i>The library will be closing
in five minutes.</i>

21:05.364 --> 21:06.831
- Oh, no.
- Don't worry.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.092
I'll go up to the stacks
and pull everything you need.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.327
- It'll all be here tomorrow morning.
- Thanks.

21:11.503 --> 21:13.198
That'll give me time
to catch up on reading.

21:13.372 --> 21:15.306
- Enjoy it.
- Bye.

21:25.550 --> 21:28.246
<i>At this stage in my life,
the last thing I wanted to do</i>

21:28.420 --> 21:30.718
<i>was ask my brother Will for a favor.</i>

21:30.889 --> 21:35.189
<i>But when push comes to shove,
you gotta go with the flow.</i>

21:38.897 --> 21:40.262
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:40.432 --> 21:42.059
<i>How was 2001?</i>

21:43.769 --> 21:45.430
It was a real space odyssey.

21:45.604 --> 21:47.469
Know the part when Hal,
the computer, flips out?

21:47.639 --> 21:49.402
- Yeah.
- Well, so did Michelle.

21:49.574 --> 21:51.166
It was a real bummer,
so we had to leave.

21:51.943 --> 21:53.376
She flipped out?
What was the matter?

21:53.545 --> 21:54.637
Was she on something?

21:55.547 --> 21:57.174
Well...

21:57.949 --> 21:59.177
She took some LSD.

21:59.351 --> 22:01.080
Well, did you take her
to the emergency room?

22:01.253 --> 22:02.550
No, we brought her here.

22:02.721 --> 22:04.188
Why did you bring her here?

22:04.356 --> 22:05.721
The only way to get her to maintain

22:05.891 --> 22:07.552
was to promise her
a chocolate shake.

22:07.726 --> 22:10.422
I mean, she's coming now.
She should be fine.

22:11.096 --> 22:12.996
- Where is she now?
- In Peter's van.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.065
- Did she get the drugs from that guy?
- No.

22:15.233 --> 22:16.996
What about you?
Did you do any acid tonight?

22:17.169 --> 22:19.899
You know I don't do psychedelics.

22:20.072 --> 22:22.404
Well, except for that time
I did mushrooms in Tuna Canyon.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.709
All right.
All right, you can bring her in.

22:26.878 --> 22:29.938
I'll stay with her, talk her down,
fix her some food, whatever it takes.

22:30.115 --> 22:31.673
But Peter's gotta wait outside.

22:32.718 --> 22:34.208
Thanks.

22:37.155 --> 22:39.851
<i>I knew my brother would volunteer
to take care of Michelle.</i>

22:40.025 --> 22:41.890
<i>The fact is
he always had a crush on her,</i>

22:42.060 --> 22:45.029
<i>but was too shy
to do anything about it.</i>

22:45.197 --> 22:47.062
Hey, Michelle.

22:51.236 --> 22:54.569
<i>Me, on the other hand,
I wear my heart like a wheel.</i>

22:56.241 --> 22:57.401
Peter.

23:01.713 --> 23:03.943
Peter, we can't do this.

23:04.116 --> 23:07.017
For sure we can, Wendy.
You've just gotta live in the moment.

23:07.185 --> 23:10.552
I mean, nothing can be more beautiful
or spiritual or existentially pure

23:10.722 --> 23:14.556
than two bodies and souls
melding into one.

23:14.726 --> 23:16.250
Yeah, but if Michelle hadn't OD'd,

23:16.428 --> 23:18.328
she would have been the one
here melding.

23:18.497 --> 23:20.727
Okay, so Michelle's into her own trip,
but you know what?

23:20.899 --> 23:24.630
She's not into that bourgeois
monogamy thing and neither am I.

23:24.803 --> 23:29.001
I just wanna be free
and spontaneous.

23:29.174 --> 23:31.665
I wanna be it with you.

23:31.843 --> 23:34.641
If you can't be with the one you love,
love the one you're with?

23:34.813 --> 23:38.408
You know I don't wanna do anything
to bum you out or to hassle you.

23:38.583 --> 23:42.075
And I don't wanna make you do
anything that you don't wanna do.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.745
I just wanna make love to you.

23:45.991 --> 23:48.357
Yeah, sweet love.

23:56.968 --> 23:59.596
<i>Why do I get so possessive, Diary?</i>

23:59.771 --> 24:02.331
<i>Why am I so insecure?</i>

24:02.507 --> 24:07.342
<i>I couldn't let him go all the way,
not while he's still with Michelle.</i>

24:15.787 --> 24:19.154
<i>I lost what could have been
the great love of my life tonight.</i>

24:19.691 --> 24:22.854
<i>I lost Peter Brinkley forever.</i>

24:30.469 --> 24:32.334
I'm surprised
Brenda didn't leave the lights on.

24:32.504 --> 24:34.495
Yeah, she must have left early.

24:38.944 --> 24:40.275
You think we paid too much for it?

24:40.445 --> 24:43.744
No, it's a great piece. It's unique.

24:43.915 --> 24:46.713
- Well, maybe 5 percent.
- Yeah.

24:48.386 --> 24:50.980
- Honey, you're here.
- Hey.

24:53.558 --> 24:55.423
What's wrong?

24:58.930 --> 25:00.830
I love Dylan.

25:01.633 --> 25:04.067
That's why
I didn't go away with them.

25:05.570 --> 25:07.435
Poor Wendy.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.633
Who's Wendy?

25:10.809 --> 25:13.175
I think she's losing it.

25:26.324 --> 25:27.814
<i>Dear Diary,</i>

25:27.993 --> 25:30.860
<i>sometimes I don't recognize myself
in the mirror anymore,</i>

25:31.029 --> 25:34.362
<i>and I can't figure out
if that's bad or that's good.</i>

25:34.533 --> 25:36.125
<i>I just have to learn
how to stop living up</i>

25:36.301 --> 25:37.962
<i>to other people's expectations.</i>

25:38.136 --> 25:41.037
<i>And learn how to stop
being so hard on myself.</i>

25:44.309 --> 25:45.867
<i>Today was a good day, though.</i>

25:46.044 --> 25:49.480
<i>I met Maryanne and Michelle
over at the Pit for old times' sake.</i>

25:49.648 --> 25:50.842
<i>What a scene.</i>

25:51.016 --> 25:52.779
Sit down.

25:53.451 --> 25:55.885
<i>Especially
with Ronnie and Seth lurking about.</i>

25:56.054 --> 25:57.078
Look at them over there.

25:57.255 --> 25:59.780
Two years ago,
they were pledging the same sorority.

25:59.958 --> 26:02.324
Now that sorority folded.

26:02.694 --> 26:04.662
Michelle Carson's on the pill.

26:04.829 --> 26:07.161
How do you know she's on the pill?

26:07.332 --> 26:11.268
That's not important now, is it?
What's important here is you.

26:11.436 --> 26:13.165
From listening to your rap,
I can tell you...

26:13.338 --> 26:15.238
I'm horny.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.841
I told you Maryanne Bagley
was a prude.

26:18.009 --> 26:19.306
I know, I know.

26:19.477 --> 26:21.911
There's just something about her
that keeps me hanging on.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.640
I'm gonna take her to the Donovan
concert at the Bowl tonight,

26:24.816 --> 26:26.249
see if I can turn things around.

26:26.418 --> 26:30.115
Well, then, tonight is the night
for the full-court press.

26:30.288 --> 26:33.223
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
she's not into contact sports.

26:33.391 --> 26:34.983
Oh, yes, she is.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.321
You just have to find out
the games people play

26:37.495 --> 26:39.053
and have a little faith.

26:39.230 --> 26:41.858
Well, thank you, Reverend Ike.

26:42.834 --> 26:45.325
Laugh all you want, I'm a believer.

26:45.503 --> 26:47.562
You tell a girl
something she wants to hear,

26:47.739 --> 26:49.502
you'll get what you want.

26:50.008 --> 26:53.569
Yeah, well, the hard part
is figuring out what they wanna hear.

26:53.745 --> 26:55.212
No, you make that up
as you go along.

26:55.380 --> 26:56.904
The hard part
is trying to convince them

26:57.082 --> 26:58.879
to stay in your dorm room
after curfew.

26:59.050 --> 27:01.041
That's what's hard.

27:13.865 --> 27:16.595
I really loved
the way he did this in concert.

27:16.768 --> 27:21.171
Yeah, Donovan's a genius.
You wanna hear it again?

27:21.339 --> 27:23.136
Oh, I'd love to, but...

27:23.541 --> 27:26.101
Well what about the other side?
We could hear that once more.

27:26.277 --> 27:28.336
I don't know. It's getting late, isn't it?

27:29.080 --> 27:31.378
I don't know, is it?

27:33.918 --> 27:35.715
No, it's only 11:30.

27:35.887 --> 27:38.720
Well, that can't be.
I mean, the concert ended at 11.

27:40.859 --> 27:43.828
Oh, yeah, you're right.

27:43.995 --> 27:47.158
Someone must've accidentally
unplugged my clock radio.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.297
I'll find out what time it is.

27:54.939 --> 27:57.999
At the sound of the tone,
the time will be...

27:58.943 --> 28:01.810
Oh, you're not gonna believe this.
It's 2:15.

28:01.980 --> 28:03.038
Oh, my God, Seth.

28:03.214 --> 28:05.148
You've gotta get me out of here.
It's after hours.

28:05.316 --> 28:08.217
You kidding, you wanna get busted?
The R.A.'s are right by the elevator.

28:08.386 --> 28:11.150
I mean, we could get kicked out
of school. We could get demerits.

28:11.322 --> 28:13.313
What are we gonna do?

28:13.491 --> 28:15.049
<i>And what they did, of course,</i>

28:15.226 --> 28:17.694
<i>was turn out the lights
and go to sleep.</i>

28:18.263 --> 28:19.992
<i>Except they didn't go to sleep,</i>

28:20.165 --> 28:22.827
<i>which turned out to be
a total bummer in the extreme.</i>

28:23.001 --> 28:26.095
<i>For after Maryanne gave in
and went all the way with Seth,</i>

28:26.271 --> 28:28.637
<i>he never spoke to her again.</i>

28:33.511 --> 28:35.138
Feeling any better, honey?

28:35.313 --> 28:37.281
Oh, a lot better, thanks.

28:37.449 --> 28:40.748
A hot bath was an excellent
suggestion, very life-affirming.

28:40.919 --> 28:42.409
Very '60s.

28:42.587 --> 28:44.282
Your mother was telling me
about that diary.

28:44.456 --> 28:45.718
Oh, I cannot put it down.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.949
I mean, even though
it happened 25 years ago,

28:48.126 --> 28:50.822
I can relate to practically everything
that Wendy went through.

28:50.995 --> 28:53.589
- I bet we could relate to some of that.
- Yeah, you would.

28:53.765 --> 28:57.428
Actually, there's one part in it
that I wanna read to you, come on in.

29:00.538 --> 29:01.800
There's this part
where she wrote

29:01.973 --> 29:03.873
about war and
the Student Mobilization Committee.

29:04.042 --> 29:06.340
It sounds a lot like the way
that your father was with you.

29:06.511 --> 29:08.570
Lot of cursing, huh?

29:08.980 --> 29:12.541
Well, Wendy's brother kicked in
the television set.

29:12.717 --> 29:14.014
Here it is.

29:14.185 --> 29:16.745
"Dear Diary, in Asia,
the Vietnamese people

29:16.921 --> 29:19.651
are supposedly fighting
for the right of self-determination. "

29:19.824 --> 29:24.022
<i>At my house in flats of Beverly Hills,
I am fighting for the right to exist.</i>

29:24.195 --> 29:27.926
I'm sorry, this is just more of that
same old left-wing rhetoric

29:28.099 --> 29:29.532
that's tearing this country apart.

29:29.934 --> 29:32.300
You see, you ask him a question,
all you get is a lecture.

29:32.470 --> 29:34.768
For Pete's sake, Will,
answer your sister

29:34.939 --> 29:37.635
so I can eat my chicken tetrazzini
in peace for a change.

29:38.643 --> 29:40.008
I forgot what the question was.

29:40.178 --> 29:42.078
The question is,
did you need my permission

29:42.247 --> 29:44.181
when you joined
the Officers Training Corps?

29:44.349 --> 29:46.146
That's not the point.

29:46.317 --> 29:47.875
- Yes or no?
- No.

29:48.052 --> 29:50.543
So why do I need your permission
to go to a peaceful rally?

29:50.722 --> 29:53.316
Because it's not gonna be
a peaceful rally.

29:53.491 --> 29:54.685
That's not true, Will.

29:54.859 --> 29:58.818
Dad, this is just another way
for Peter Brinkley and the SDS

29:58.997 --> 30:00.362
to try to shut down the university.

30:00.532 --> 30:01.931
Not true.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.226
It's gonna backfire.

30:03.401 --> 30:05.801
You'll see, it's gonna become
a violent demonstration.

30:05.970 --> 30:08.336
The rally is sponsored
by the American Friends Committee,

30:08.506 --> 30:10.770
the Newman Center
and the Academic Senate.

30:10.942 --> 30:13.934
That is hardly the vanguard
of the New American Revolution.

30:15.580 --> 30:18.174
All right, the real question is,

30:18.349 --> 30:20.544
are you gonna come
and watch my graduation?

30:20.718 --> 30:22.709
How can I possibly do that?

30:22.887 --> 30:24.218
It's easy.

30:24.389 --> 30:26.584
You don't go
to your damn demonstration.

30:26.758 --> 30:28.089
You go with Mom and Dad
to the base

30:28.259 --> 30:29.988
and you clap for me
when I get my commission.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.185
Will.

30:31.362 --> 30:35.025
And not because you support the war,
but because I'm your brother.

30:40.038 --> 30:43.132
You know, we can't even parade
around the campus

30:43.308 --> 30:44.798
because of your rally.

30:44.976 --> 30:46.705
You know how that makes me feel?

30:48.713 --> 30:50.340
<i>Book him, Danno!</i>

30:52.417 --> 30:57.047
Will, I was watching that program.

30:58.356 --> 31:00.119
Do you see
what you've done to this family?

31:06.931 --> 31:09.058
<i>In hindsight, I can't help but wonder</i>

31:09.234 --> 31:11.099
<i>if Peter and some
of the other student leaders</i>

31:11.269 --> 31:14.705
<i>hadn't used the rally as a pretext to
take over the administration building</i>

31:14.873 --> 31:17.603
<i>and see themselves
on the evening news.</i>

31:17.775 --> 31:19.106
<i>But in all fairness,</i>

31:19.277 --> 31:22.804
<i>there was a real sense of community
on the campus that night.</i>

31:22.981 --> 31:25.381
<i>And a sense that our voices
would be heard,</i>

31:25.550 --> 31:27.643
<i>and our policy demands
would be accepted,</i>

31:27.819 --> 31:31.186
<i>and the fate of the world would
be forever changed because of it.</i>

31:31.356 --> 31:35.190
Wait a minute!
What happened to all my soldiers?

31:35.360 --> 31:37.851
What happened to their draft cards?

31:38.029 --> 31:40.224
Beats me, Uncle Sam.

31:40.398 --> 31:41.831
<i>But as time wore on,</i>

31:42.000 --> 31:45.026
<i>I became overwhelmed
with an impending sense of dread</i>

31:45.203 --> 31:47.364
<i>that the only thing
that was gonna happen that night</i>

31:47.538 --> 31:50.063
<i>was that most of us
were gonna get our heads bashed in.</i>

31:56.180 --> 31:58.080
- Excuse me.
- Wendy, we've been looking for you.

31:58.249 --> 32:00.979
- We don't wanna get arrested.
- Me neither, but I have to find Peter.

32:01.152 --> 32:03.017
Okay, we'll be in the quad.

32:04.622 --> 32:05.884
- Wendy, are you holding?
- What?

32:06.057 --> 32:08.150
- Do you have any grass?
- No.

32:08.326 --> 32:10.954
Just keep your bandannas wet,
everything will be all right, okay?

32:11.129 --> 32:13.256
- Don't freak out on me.
- I don't wanna get arrested.

32:13.431 --> 32:15.331
You won't.
That's not what's going on here.

32:15.500 --> 32:16.558
Peter, look out!

32:20.004 --> 32:23.337
"I was charged with trespassing
and resisting arrest.

32:24.542 --> 32:27.067
Fortunately, the charges against me
and the other students,

32:27.245 --> 32:29.679
including Peter, were dropped.

32:30.848 --> 32:35.683
Unfortunately, my brother and his unit
shipped out to Da Nang that morning

32:35.853 --> 32:38.515
and I never got the chance
to say goodbye. "

32:42.026 --> 32:45.587
Yeah, that's what it was like.

32:45.997 --> 32:49.592
Mom, Dad, peace.

32:52.070 --> 32:53.594
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.

32:53.771 --> 32:55.295
Good night.

33:07.852 --> 33:09.615
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

33:09.787 --> 33:11.846
- Hey there.
- You got a good night's sleep.

33:12.023 --> 33:15.550
I did. I dreamt I went to Disneyland
with Judy Collins and Joan Baez,

33:15.727 --> 33:18.321
and we wound up singing folk songs
on the Matterhorn.

33:19.564 --> 33:21.555
It sounds like this diary
is really getting to you.

33:21.733 --> 33:24.201
I might as well be Wendy Edwards.
I mean, think about it.

33:24.369 --> 33:25.495
We had the same room,

33:25.670 --> 33:28.434
we both got arrested
and got the charges dropped.

33:28.606 --> 33:29.698
Thank God.

33:29.874 --> 33:32.604
And we both let ourselves
get hung up on guys with sideburns.

33:32.777 --> 33:34.404
But you have
a much better relationship

33:34.579 --> 33:35.910
with your brother than she did.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.344
Well, actually,
they ended up making amends.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.848
He wrote her this incredible letter
from Vietnam.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.249
Here, let me read it to you.

33:46.324 --> 33:49.418
"Dear Wendy, thanks for the tapes. "

33:49.594 --> 33:51.789
<i>You don't know how much it means
to hear from you,</i>

33:51.963 --> 33:55.899
<i>especially since we weren't
on such good terms when I left.</i>

33:56.067 --> 33:58.627
<i>I've gotta confess,
I wasn't really prepared</i>

33:58.803 --> 34:02.830
<i>for how disorienting
everything is over here.</i>

34:03.007 --> 34:05.771
<i>Morale is pretty low,
and even I'm counting the days</i>

34:05.943 --> 34:09.071
<i>till we can get over to Bangkok
for some R and R.</i>

34:11.248 --> 34:16.812
<i>But until then, we got a job to do,
so there's no use in complaining.</i>

34:16.987 --> 34:21.755
<i>Besides, I'm not sure
anybody's listening anymore.</i>

34:22.560 --> 34:25.688
<i>I love you. I miss you.</i>

34:25.862 --> 34:27.228
<i>Will.</i>

34:31.369 --> 34:34.360
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get
your guys' day started the wrong way.

34:34.539 --> 34:38.304
No, no, no.
Just brings back a lot of memories.

34:38.476 --> 34:40.103
Yeah.

34:40.277 --> 34:41.643
Makes me want
to turn back the clock

34:41.813 --> 34:43.974
and start over again.

34:44.148 --> 34:46.708
Yeah, it makes me
wanna find the real Wendy Edwards.

34:55.525 --> 34:57.255
Hi.

34:57.829 --> 35:01.697
Oh, hi. I was expecting you.

35:02.333 --> 35:03.766
Did you find her in the yearbook?

35:03.935 --> 35:07.427
Well, it's so disorganized up there
I was lucky to find the elevator.

35:07.605 --> 35:09.539
- You're kidding.
- Never fear.

35:09.707 --> 35:11.641
I have a friend who works
at the Alumni House,

35:11.809 --> 35:14.778
and she gave me
the last known address for her.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.743
I can't believe
I'm gonna meet Wendy.

35:16.914 --> 35:19.075
So tell me, what's the first thing
you're gonna ask her?

35:20.351 --> 35:25.379
What do the numbers
134, ten, 66 and 72 mean?

35:25.556 --> 35:26.853
- What?
- Look.

35:27.024 --> 35:29.959
This is her last entry,
July 18th, 1969.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.619
There's these numbers.
I mean, they just came out of nowhere.

35:32.797 --> 35:35.732
Well, you know what happened
July 18th, 1969?

35:36.300 --> 35:38.234
Yeah, I do.

35:39.770 --> 35:41.237
Did you order a pizza?

35:41.405 --> 35:43.532
One pepperoni and one mushroom.

35:43.708 --> 35:44.732
What kind of crust?

35:44.909 --> 35:46.137
For God's sake, Pippa.

35:46.310 --> 35:49.905
There's a man walking on the moon
and you're talking about pizza.

35:51.249 --> 35:53.683
There's money in my purse.

36:00.925 --> 36:02.256
Peter?

36:02.994 --> 36:06.486
Long time no see.
How have you been?

36:07.431 --> 36:08.693
How have you been?

36:10.268 --> 36:12.429
It's been kind of intense.

36:13.237 --> 36:14.670
Yeah, I was worried about you.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.238
Wendy, who's out there?

36:16.407 --> 36:19.069
It's Neil Armstrong, Dr. Edwards.

36:19.243 --> 36:20.972
Wendy!

36:24.749 --> 36:27.912
You know,
you're always getting me in hot water.

36:29.487 --> 36:32.320
Well, I just wanted to come
and say goodbye.

36:32.490 --> 36:34.151
You're leaving?

36:34.325 --> 36:37.123
Yeah,
I'm gonna drive across the country.

36:37.295 --> 36:40.355
Far-out. By yourself?

36:40.531 --> 36:42.158
No, with Michelle.

36:45.603 --> 36:47.070
Before we broke up,
we made this pact

36:47.238 --> 36:50.639
that we'd go
to this rock festival back East,

36:50.808 --> 36:53.276
so we're still gonna go.

36:53.444 --> 36:54.741
You're going to Woodstock?

36:54.912 --> 36:57.881
I got plenty of room in the van
if you wanna go.

36:59.250 --> 37:01.718
I don't think
Michelle would appreciate that.

37:01.886 --> 37:04.787
Yeah,
I don't even think Michelle will notice.

37:04.956 --> 37:06.924
What? Is she always tripping?

37:07.091 --> 37:10.652
Yeah, she's pretty out there lately.

37:11.729 --> 37:15.426
After the concert, she wants
to backpack around Europe,

37:15.600 --> 37:16.624
or something.

37:16.801 --> 37:20.897
Go live in a commune
in the Greek Isles.

37:21.939 --> 37:23.372
And what are you gonna do?

37:23.841 --> 37:26.241
I'm not coming back either.

37:27.545 --> 37:29.570
I was thinking maybe Canada.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.237
To live?

37:31.415 --> 37:34.578
If I stay here,
they're gonna draft me for sure.

37:35.453 --> 37:37.717
Would you come with me, Wendy?

37:39.190 --> 37:40.885
Please?

37:42.526 --> 37:43.857
<i>So, what did she do?</i>

37:44.028 --> 37:45.620
She wrote down these numbers.

37:46.030 --> 37:48.555
When you find out what they mean,
will you let me know?

37:49.433 --> 37:50.627
I promise.

37:50.801 --> 37:52.735
Say hi to Wendy for me.

37:53.371 --> 37:54.736
Bye.

38:35.446 --> 38:36.970
Wendy?

38:38.949 --> 38:40.177
Yes?

38:42.887 --> 38:44.912
I think I have something
that belongs to you.

38:49.894 --> 38:52.590
Oh, my.

38:53.531 --> 38:55.726
You know, we got pretty whacked
by the quake out here,

38:55.900 --> 39:00.098
but looking at this
after all these years...

39:00.271 --> 39:05.038
God. It's a real jolt too,
let me tell you.

39:05.876 --> 39:08.868
I always assumed
my mother threw it away.

39:09.413 --> 39:13.645
Now I'd be too embarrassed
to show it to her.

39:14.518 --> 39:15.951
Is that Pippa?

39:17.021 --> 39:18.147
Yeah.

39:18.322 --> 39:20.813
And that's my son Brian,

39:21.225 --> 39:23.090
his girlfriend, Michelle.

39:23.260 --> 39:25.125
Michelle?

39:25.296 --> 39:27.560
Isn't that ironic?

39:29.767 --> 39:31.029
What happened to her?

39:31.202 --> 39:32.794
She burned out early.

39:33.537 --> 39:38.600
Died of a heroin overdose in '71,
I think it was.

39:40.845 --> 39:42.642
Do you have a photograph of her?

39:43.914 --> 39:46.974
Let me see
if I can find my old yearbook.

39:50.287 --> 39:51.652
That's Michelle?

39:51.822 --> 39:53.619
She was very pretty, wasn't she?

39:53.791 --> 39:55.224
I thought she was a blond.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.985
No.

39:57.661 --> 39:59.595
No.

39:59.764 --> 40:01.425
Oh, Maryanne was a blond.

40:01.599 --> 40:02.964
That's Maryanne?

40:03.134 --> 40:06.934
- With Seth and Ronnie.
- No way.

40:07.104 --> 40:08.833
Yeah, that's them.

40:09.006 --> 40:12.169
Well, in my imagination,
they looked a lot different.

40:13.344 --> 40:15.335
Are you guys still close?

40:15.513 --> 40:18.880
At this point, I think
it's fair to say we've all lost touch.

40:19.049 --> 40:20.243
Even with Peter?

40:23.220 --> 40:28.055
I see his credit on the TV sometimes,
but that's it.

40:28.225 --> 40:29.715
What does he do?

40:29.894 --> 40:30.986
He's a writer.

40:31.862 --> 40:33.625
What about your brother?
How's Will?

40:35.433 --> 40:36.866
Will.

40:39.703 --> 40:41.762
Will never made it home.

40:44.742 --> 40:48.872
Do you have any brothers and sisters,
Brenda?

40:49.046 --> 40:50.138
A brother.

40:50.314 --> 40:52.077
Are you close?

40:52.783 --> 40:54.978
I would like to think we are.

40:55.986 --> 40:57.613
Keep working at it.

40:59.056 --> 41:01.786
Times change, people change.

41:02.660 --> 41:06.426
It's so damn easy
to take things for granted.

41:11.802 --> 41:15.568
So when things settle down next week,
I'll give you a call.

41:15.739 --> 41:16.797
Definitely.

41:16.974 --> 41:20.410
I'll give you tour of the old homestead,
buy you a burger or something.

41:20.578 --> 41:22.443
I'd like that.

41:22.613 --> 41:24.410
Oh, you know what, I almost forgot.

41:24.582 --> 41:27.380
In your last entry, you had
a bunch of numbers written down.

41:29.887 --> 41:32.651
One-thirty-four, ten, 66...

41:32.823 --> 41:34.017
Yeah, what were those?

41:34.825 --> 41:38.124
Those are the numbers of the roads
we took to get to Woodstock.

41:39.463 --> 41:40.487
You went to Woodstock?

41:41.365 --> 41:42.730
Yeah.

41:44.401 --> 41:45.425
Cool.

41:46.937 --> 41:48.734
You take care of yourself, Brenda.

41:49.173 --> 41:50.731
You too.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.290
You know, when I told you
you could borrow my car,

42:07.458 --> 42:09.153
I didn't think you'd take me up on it.

42:09.326 --> 42:10.623
What are you doing here?

42:10.794 --> 42:12.091
We're all here.

42:12.263 --> 42:14.527
- Because it was raining.
- There wasn't much snow.

42:14.698 --> 42:17.292
Yup, and it is sunny
and 80 degrees in Palm Springs.

42:17.468 --> 42:21.063
- My grandparents said come on down.
- And you too if you wanna come.

42:21.839 --> 42:24.000
- Far-out.
- Far-out?

42:24.174 --> 42:26.039
<i>What's this?
You rented the movie Woodstock?</i>

42:26.544 --> 42:28.205
- Yeah.
- Both parts?

42:28.379 --> 42:31.371
What are you doing
calling your sister "Woodstock"?

42:32.116 --> 42:35.051
- That'd make you Snoopy, wouldn't it?
- Let's check it out.
