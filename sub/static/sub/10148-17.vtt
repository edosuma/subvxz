WEBVTT

01:25.336 --> 01:26.420
Hey...

01:31.801 --> 01:33.427
It's amazing
how many friends you can buy

01:33.511 --> 01:34.679
with a rich stepfather.

01:35.054 --> 01:37.139
Is it possible
that we're just a teeny bit jealous?

01:37.515 --> 01:38.515
Maybe.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.935
Talk, talk, talk. Let's dance.

01:44.230 --> 01:47.024
You sure don't do anything halfway,
Big Jim.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.528
Ha! There's no reason the Tate family
shouldn't have the best,

01:50.695 --> 01:53.406
and, as long as I'm around,
that's what it's gonna have.

01:56.284 --> 01:57.284
Laid off?

01:57.451 --> 01:58.828
Paxton Powers wants to move

01:58.911 --> 02:01.038
the light weapons division
into new areas.

02:01.372 --> 02:04.250
You mean, he wants to dump me
and hire someone else at a lower salary?

02:04.709 --> 02:06.252
I won't dignify that with an answer.

02:06.669 --> 02:07.962
Due to recent market reversals,

02:08.045 --> 02:10.172
your severance package,
alas, will be modest.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.591
I built that division up from nothing.

02:12.925 --> 02:14.176
I was in special forces.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.637
I've got degrees
in electronics and engineering.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.687
They'll have to hire two people
to replace me.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.056
Take it easy, Jim.

02:20.182 --> 02:22.059
Look, Karen, I just got married.

02:22.143 --> 02:24.145
I'm remodeling the house.
I've got alimony.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.645
Things are tight.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.357
I mean... You started out
as my assistant.

02:28.691 --> 02:29.567
Put in a word for me.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.486
Let me outsource as a consultant
until I can find something else.

02:34.864 --> 02:36.157
There's nothing I can do.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.332
But the electrical contractor
comes tomorrow,

02:44.415 --> 02:47.335
and I've got to get a check to Mr. Sweem
for the new drapes.

02:47.752 --> 02:48.832
What can I do to help, Dad?

02:49.003 --> 02:50.838
Hey, everyone, stop, right now.

02:51.297 --> 02:53.382
You're looking
at the best weapons designer around.

02:53.466 --> 02:55.384
Other companies
are already bidding for me.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.678
This layoff is a huge blessing.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.765
Now, let's stop all this panic
and go out to dinner.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.098
Jared's buying.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.978
Sony, Jim,
but the military is cutting back.

03:06.979 --> 03:08.814
Hey, I'm lucky to have a job.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.918
<i>We've got a project
coming up you'd be perfect for.</i>

03:11.942 --> 03:13.444
<i>Can you hang on for 18 months?</i>

03:16.697 --> 03:19.367
What can I say, Jim?
These cutbacks affect everyone.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.369
Force Tech can't afford
to bring you on board.

03:21.744 --> 03:23.829
Force Tech has a short memory, Istivan.

03:24.288 --> 03:26.415
I've helped you guys out before
under the table.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.417
And we paid you generously.

03:29.377 --> 03:33.881
Of course, there are certain
unofficial job opportunities.

03:34.965 --> 03:35.965
Like what?

03:36.133 --> 03:38.594
You once mentioned a sonic wave device

03:38.677 --> 03:41.639
that could shatter steel,
the perfect anti-tank weapon.

03:42.098 --> 03:44.767
I designed it,
but Wayne-Powers passed on a prototype.

03:45.142 --> 03:48.104
Force Tech has contacts
with a certain foreign government

03:48.187 --> 03:52.566
that is, oh, temporarily in disfavor
with the world community.

03:52.858 --> 03:55.986
If you were to build them a prototype,
they would be embarrassingly grateful.

03:57.196 --> 03:58.196
It's not that easy.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.333
I'd have to steal the specifications
and build the thing from scratch.

04:01.492 --> 04:02.618
I understand, Jim.

04:02.993 --> 04:06.789
If it's too much, you can always go live
on your modest severance package,

04:06.956 --> 04:09.417
but our client won't wait,
and neither will I.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.085
I need an answer now.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.102
{933931

05:24.533 --> 05:25.868
Yeah!

06:43.612 --> 06:46.031
You're going to jail.
Easy or hard, it's up to you.

06:46.699 --> 06:48.367
Here's a tip, hard isn't fun.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.090
Untraceable, tax-free.

08:26.507 --> 08:27.591
A small down payment.

08:28.384 --> 08:31.762
Not bad. I still need to swipe
a high-capacity circuit board.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.764
You made quite an impression on the web.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.517
They're already calling you
"The Human Armory."

08:36.934 --> 08:38.352
You build this stuff, you test it,

08:38.727 --> 08:41.087
but you always wonder how it'll work
when the pressure's on.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.355
Are you satisfied?

08:42.690 --> 08:43.691
It was like war.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.484
It is a war, Jim.

08:45.943 --> 08:49.196
Every great conflict
is centered around economic struggle.

08:49.446 --> 08:52.908
Your personal battle
for financial security is no different.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.327
Tell that to Batman. He almost got me.

08:56.370 --> 08:57.663
You may have to take him out.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.999
After all, wars have their casualties.

09:07.423 --> 09:08.674
<i>Still no official comment</i>

09:08.799 --> 09:10.884
<i>from Wayne-Powers
regarding last week's break-in.</i>

09:11.218 --> 09:12.845
<i>However, sources state that Armory</i>

09:12.928 --> 09:15.013
<i>may have accessed
top-secret research files.</i>

09:15.305 --> 09:17.266
I told those dummies
to beef up security.

09:17.891 --> 09:21.395
Jim, honey, Mr. Sweem wants to knock out
that old rock fireplace

09:21.603 --> 09:23.147
and put in Italian marble.

09:23.397 --> 09:26.316
I wasn't sure I'd like it,
but he faxed over these designs.

09:26.483 --> 09:27.483
I don't care.

09:27.651 --> 09:28.986
It's just that, even discounted,

09:29.069 --> 09:31.739
the marble is going to be
20% above the bid, not including...

09:31.822 --> 09:32.822
I don't care!

09:36.243 --> 09:38.495
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.540
Whatever you want, hon,
I'm sure it'll look great.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.376
I think
I'll get some work done out back.

09:45.002 --> 09:46.002
See you later.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.175
How about this?

09:52.509 --> 09:54.720
"Men With Little Heads." Too retro.

09:56.722 --> 09:58.432
I guess we don't say "Hi" anymore.

09:59.308 --> 10:02.102
Oh, Terry, sorry.
I was thinking about stuff.

10:02.352 --> 10:03.187
I bet.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.606
Where does the man
who has everything put it all?

10:06.356 --> 10:07.356
What is your problem?

10:07.566 --> 10:09.067
Take it easy. I was just kidding.

10:12.154 --> 10:14.323
Sony,
sometimes she really ticks me off.

10:14.907 --> 10:16.658
- You okay?
- Yeah, fine.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.285
What's the matter?

10:19.870 --> 10:20.870
It's my stepdad.

10:21.205 --> 10:22.539
He's acting very un-schway.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.249
Layoffs hit people hard.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.335
Tell me. He's got a workshop.

10:26.502 --> 10:28.837
It's become his new home.
Mom and I aren't allowed in.

10:29.046 --> 10:30.422
He's pushing us out of his life.

10:30.589 --> 10:31.589
It's not like him.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.467
He's just depressed. Give him some time.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.385
- He'll snap out of it.
- I guess so.

10:38.096 --> 10:40.432
What's with Jared,
the bond market crash?

10:40.766 --> 10:43.227
His dad's a light weapons expert.
He gets laid off.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.853
Suddenly, Wayne-Powers is burglarized

10:44.937 --> 10:47.417
by a guy with enough equipment
to stand off a marine battalion.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.441
- Armory?
- I gotta make sure.

11:55.591 --> 11:56.591
What? Hey.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.677
What hit us? Electromagnet?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.054
I don't know, but it took out our power.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.480
Get out of here. Move, move!

15:44.361 --> 15:45.821
What are you doing in Dad's drawer?

15:46.113 --> 15:47.364
Just borrowing some socks.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.133
Did he say when he was getting back?

15:49.157 --> 15:51.159
No, he thought
the meeting could run pretty late.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.067
The client is very excited

16:24.151 --> 16:26.820
about the possibilities
of this new weapon of yours...

16:27.779 --> 16:28.905
Must've left the lights on.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.243
The war room. Very schway.

16:33.869 --> 16:35.203
You shouldn't be here, Hegedesh.

16:36.413 --> 16:37.706
Plans change.

16:37.789 --> 16:40.041
My principals have pushed
the deadline forward.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.058
Ijust have to install
this circuit board,

16:42.252 --> 16:43.545
then pay up, and we're finished.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.005
And I mean it, Hegedesh.

16:45.297 --> 16:46.297
Whatever you like, Jim.

16:47.132 --> 16:49.217
But I thought you enjoyed being Armory.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.637
Let's just say
it got a little too thrilling tonight.

16:53.221 --> 16:54.723
There.

16:55.599 --> 16:56.599
Ugh!

16:58.768 --> 16:59.768
Let go.

17:01.646 --> 17:02.480
Jared?

17:02.564 --> 17:03.564
Take your hands off him.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.276
Don't do me any favors, Armory.

17:06.526 --> 17:07.360
Jared...

17:07.444 --> 17:08.987
Mom and I were worried sick about you,

17:09.571 --> 17:12.240
but I guess blowing up the town
comes first, you dreg.

17:12.574 --> 17:13.574
This is very bad.

17:13.950 --> 17:14.950
You better do something.

17:15.452 --> 17:16.452
Back off.

17:16.786 --> 17:17.829
Son, listen to me.

17:22.834 --> 17:23.834
Listen...

17:23.919 --> 17:25.545
I heard shouting. What's going on?

17:31.509 --> 17:34.095
- Armory?
- Please, Lorraine, I had to.

17:34.304 --> 17:35.304
No!

17:36.056 --> 17:38.016
Don't you see? I did this for you.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.976
For both of you. I had to.

17:40.644 --> 17:42.979
There was no other way.
I was going to lose everything.

17:43.438 --> 17:44.648
You wouldn't have lost us.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.566
You did this for yourself, Jim.

17:46.942 --> 17:48.985
All your high talk and big money.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.195
You lied to us, and now...

17:50.862 --> 17:52.072
Listen, babe, it's over.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.616
This was just a stopgap. That's all.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.285
A way to get over the hump.
It's gonna be okay.

17:57.786 --> 17:59.579
How? 'Cause no one knows?

17:59.663 --> 18:01.164
I know. Jared knows.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.917
How in the name of heaven
is this ever gonna be okay?

18:06.253 --> 18:08.296
- What's that?
- Look at your security camera.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.591
Batman?

18:13.301 --> 18:14.636
There's no way he followed me.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.514
Let's see if he wants to drop in.

18:18.556 --> 18:19.556
Isfivan, no.

18:30.902 --> 18:33.238
I'm sorry, Jim,
but either he goes or we go.

18:52.424 --> 18:54.884
- Dad, no!
- I'm doing this for all of us.

19:15.030 --> 19:16.364
You're through, Batman.

19:22.412 --> 19:23.621
The war's over, Istivan.

19:24.122 --> 19:25.122
We lost.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.341
Dad!

19:53.943 --> 19:55.653
So the judge was lenient. I'm glad.

19:56.071 --> 19:57.655
My dad cooperated in every way.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.741
Of course, he won't be home for a while.

19:59.949 --> 20:00.950
And there's that fine.

20:01.368 --> 20:02.744
Yeah, I heard you lost the car.

20:03.745 --> 20:06.026
You meet more interesting people
on public transportation.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.125
Hey, I got my sister's car
while she's away.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.544
Any time you need a ride,
I'm there, Jared.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.421
You never made that offer to me.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.340
Maybe you're spoiled.
