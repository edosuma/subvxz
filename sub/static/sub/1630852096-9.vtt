WEBVTT

00:07.094 --> 00:09.052
<i>Previously</i> <i>
on</i> Star Trek: Discovery...

00:09.096 --> 00:11.446
You're losing sight
of the real problem.

00:11.489 --> 00:13.187
The Anomaly.
I took what I learned

00:13.230 --> 00:15.406
about the device at the center
of the DMA

00:15.450 --> 00:19.454
and designed this, a weapon
capable of destroying it.

00:19.497 --> 00:20.977
If we detonate this weapon,

00:21.021 --> 00:23.066
we cannot control the message
we're sending.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.112
If we make first contact peacefully,

00:25.155 --> 00:27.288
carefully, we can.

00:27.331 --> 00:29.290
And I understand the appeal
of Tarka's plan.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.814
But communication and diplomacy,
this is why the Federation

00:31.857 --> 00:33.816
has lasted for so long.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.383
It'll save more lives
in the long run.

00:35.426 --> 00:37.689
All we know for sure is that
the DMA will keep killing

00:37.733 --> 00:39.039
if we do nothing.

00:39.082 --> 00:41.650
Power source that controls
that device?

00:41.693 --> 00:44.348
I need it to go home.

00:44.392 --> 00:46.046
Book, no.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.701
<i>In order to build</i> <i>
an isolytic weapon,</i>

00:49.745 --> 00:50.876
Tarka needs isolynium.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.008
That's a black-market element

00:52.052 --> 00:53.444
that is not easy to track down.

00:53.488 --> 00:55.359
<i>I planted a tracker.</i>

00:55.403 --> 00:57.274
The signal can be detected
from multiple sectors away.

00:57.318 --> 00:59.711
If the DMA is
their mining equipment,

00:59.755 --> 01:01.496
I can only imagine
what their weapons are like.

01:01.539 --> 01:04.194
And if their power supply
is threatened,

01:04.238 --> 01:07.850
it will almost certainly
be seen as a hostile act.

01:07.893 --> 01:10.200
Booker and Tarka
must be stopped.

01:10.244 --> 01:12.028
I know.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.650
<i>
Not as much isolynium in here</i> <i>
as I thought.</i>

01:25.694 --> 01:27.304
<i>Wil it be enough?</i>

01:27.348 --> 01:29.045
<i>
Federation banned it</i> <i>
for good reason.</i>

01:29.089 --> 01:31.047
<i>A little goes a long way.</i>

01:31.091 --> 01:33.658
Is it enough to destroy the DMA?

01:33.702 --> 01:35.791
And then some.

01:36.574 --> 01:38.098
Careful.

01:42.406 --> 01:44.582
Careful...

01:58.857 --> 02:01.425
And we have ourselves a weapon.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.514
How long till it's ready?

02:03.558 --> 02:05.081
Five or six hours.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.128
I need to calibrate
to destroy the DMA controller

02:08.171 --> 02:11.261
but protect
the internal power source.

02:11.305 --> 02:14.177
As long as I can generate
a null-space bubble

02:14.221 --> 02:16.005
within the isolytic
detonation field,

02:16.048 --> 02:17.615
the power source
should be fine.

02:17.659 --> 02:20.096
Just... speed it up.

02:20.140 --> 02:24.187
She'll understand,
once this is over.

02:24.231 --> 02:25.449
They all will.

02:25.493 --> 02:29.279
We're not gonna lose anyone else
to that thing.

02:34.632 --> 02:36.286
Come.

02:38.070 --> 02:41.030
- Captain?
- Finally got a response from Book.

02:41.073 --> 02:43.424
It's encrypted,
so it can't be traced.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.382
I thought you should see it.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.605
Michael.

02:50.648 --> 02:52.694
Hey.

02:53.651 --> 02:56.611
I went through all the data
you sent.

02:56.654 --> 02:59.440
Makes sense the DMA could be
some kind of mining device

02:59.483 --> 03:03.444
and all that's happened
is collateral damage.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.272
But even if this is true,

03:05.315 --> 03:07.448
it doesn't change how many lives
have been lost.

03:07.491 --> 03:11.278
How many more will be lost if
we don't do something right now.

03:11.321 --> 03:14.150
The DMA could move again
at any time.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.066
We just can't afford to wait.

03:19.764 --> 03:22.332
I love you, Michael.

03:22.376 --> 03:25.814
I wish there was a way to find
a middle ground on this, but...

03:25.857 --> 03:28.208
I just don't see it.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.776
I'm sorry.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.909
Goodbye.

03:36.390 --> 03:37.652
Well...

03:37.695 --> 03:39.480
I really thought it would
make a difference

03:39.523 --> 03:41.177
if he knew it wasn't an attack.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.398
Now, if we don't stop them,
that could be what comes next.

03:44.441 --> 03:47.749
It would seem he has left us
with no choice.

03:49.881 --> 03:51.840
To say that this wasn't easy

03:51.883 --> 03:54.016
would be an insult
to understatement.

03:54.059 --> 03:56.279
The optics, the complexities.

03:56.323 --> 03:57.367
Sir,

03:57.411 --> 04:00.501
am I able to lead
this mission or not?

04:00.544 --> 04:03.330
Are you sure
that that's what you want?

04:03.373 --> 04:05.070
It is.

04:05.114 --> 04:08.248
Well, President Rillak had
quite a lot to say about this.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.815
But she does understand
that <i>Discovery</i> is the only ship

04:10.859 --> 04:12.687
capable of reaching Mr. Booker
on time,

04:12.730 --> 04:14.602
and no one knows him
better than you.

04:14.645 --> 04:17.692
I also reminded her
that you have never let me down.

04:17.735 --> 04:19.302
Thank you, sir.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.521
Don't thank me yet.

04:20.564 --> 04:22.697
The president remains concerned

04:22.740 --> 04:25.047
that if things
don't go smoothly,

04:25.090 --> 04:26.831
you might be
too emotionally compromised

04:26.875 --> 04:28.224
to make the hard call.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.095
I have the same concern,
so I'm going to send

04:30.139 --> 04:31.706
another officer with you.

04:31.749 --> 04:34.230
Someone who will be empowered
to step in, if needed,

04:34.274 --> 04:36.319
and issue the necessary orders

04:36.363 --> 04:38.582
with the full backing
of my authority.

04:38.626 --> 04:41.716
With respect, Admiral,

04:41.759 --> 04:44.936
that-that is Captain Saru's job.

04:44.980 --> 04:48.331
He, too, is close to Book,
is he not?

04:50.899 --> 04:53.205
I understand this is awkward, Captain.

04:53.249 --> 04:55.730
May I ask who the officer is?

04:55.773 --> 04:57.253
A friendly face,

04:57.297 --> 04:59.386
which I hope will make it
easier on everyone.

04:59.429 --> 05:01.083
Commander,
will you please join us?

05:05.392 --> 05:07.263
Captain.

05:08.090 --> 05:09.744
Commander Nhan?

05:15.402 --> 05:17.926
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

05:17.969 --> 05:20.972
Uh, sir, I-I have to say,

05:21.016 --> 05:23.018
if the concern
is my connection to Book,

05:23.061 --> 05:24.802
Nhan and I go way back.

05:24.846 --> 05:27.414
I'm aware.
But she's also a Barzan.

05:27.457 --> 05:29.894
And there's a reason
so many of her world

05:29.938 --> 05:32.332
serve in the security forces.

05:33.463 --> 05:34.899
Duty above all.

05:37.032 --> 05:39.469
I'll give you two a minute.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.298
I, uh...

05:42.342 --> 05:44.822
I'd only met Book in passing,

05:44.866 --> 05:47.259
but he sounds like a good man.

05:47.303 --> 05:50.828
I'm sorry it's come to this.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.178
Thank you for that, Nhan.

05:55.180 --> 05:57.139
So, when did you join
Federation Security?

05:57.182 --> 05:58.793
I thought you were
still living on Barzan.

05:58.836 --> 06:02.100
I was, but after completing
the seed-vault mission,

06:02.144 --> 06:05.452
I ended up not staying too long.

06:05.495 --> 06:06.975
Hmm.

06:07.018 --> 06:09.238
Upgraded my breathers, though.

06:09.281 --> 06:11.980
- Real eyes, real you.
- Mm-hmm.

06:13.024 --> 06:14.156
Were you able to find
your family line

06:14.199 --> 06:15.505
and connect with them?

06:15.549 --> 06:17.725
Uh, yeah.

06:17.768 --> 06:19.291
Didn't work out.

06:19.335 --> 06:21.816
And Security asked me
to lead a cleanup task force

06:21.859 --> 06:23.208
against the Emerald Chain.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.950
Covert ops.
I couldn't tell anyone.

06:25.994 --> 06:27.604
I read the reports.

06:27.648 --> 06:30.390
Bloody skirmishes
in the outer sectors.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.437
This isn't the way
I wanted to come back.

06:34.481 --> 06:38.441
But I figured, better me
than someone you don't know.

06:39.486 --> 06:41.401
I'm glad it's you.

06:58.287 --> 07:00.071
Mr. Saru.

07:00.115 --> 07:02.204
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

07:02.247 --> 07:05.163
Not at all. It is always
a pleasure to hear from you.

07:05.207 --> 07:08.689
Well, I wonder if I may ask
a favor.

07:08.732 --> 07:13.520
On Ni'Var, I joined you in
a thresh-tor kashek meditation.

07:13.563 --> 07:17.393
I found it greatly helpful
in settling my mind.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.396
I could use such help now.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.920
Of course.

07:31.668 --> 07:33.453
Your hands.

07:37.239 --> 07:39.328
Breathe deeply.

07:42.287 --> 07:45.552
You are having difficulty focusing.

07:47.118 --> 07:48.946
I am distracted, yes.

07:48.990 --> 07:51.079
The mission to stop Mr. Booker

07:51.122 --> 07:54.517
will be a most unfortunate undertaking.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.388
Indeed it will.

07:56.432 --> 07:58.913
But I sense that is not all.

07:58.956 --> 08:03.091
You are insightful, as ever.

08:03.134 --> 08:05.485
My ward, Su'Kal.

08:05.528 --> 08:08.183
He is deeply worried
about the Anomaly.

08:08.226 --> 08:10.402
I do not know
how to comfort him.

08:10.446 --> 08:13.667
Ah, of course,
at such a dire time,

08:13.710 --> 08:16.452
these personal feelings
are of little import.

08:16.496 --> 08:21.326
Such feelings
are always of import.

08:23.111 --> 08:24.547
May I suggest,

08:24.591 --> 08:28.290
when formal meditation
proves challenging,

08:28.333 --> 08:31.598
I find the peaceful routines
of daily life

08:31.641 --> 08:33.600
and the joyful connection therein

08:33.643 --> 08:37.473
can help reestablish
inner balance.

08:37.517 --> 08:42.652
A walk, perhaps, or a-a shared
meal between friends.

08:42.696 --> 08:46.351
I would be pleased to join you,
if you'd like.

08:48.658 --> 08:53.533
I w... I will, uh,
consider that.

08:55.056 --> 08:58.015
Thank you, Madam President.

08:58.059 --> 09:00.104
Of course.

09:00.148 --> 09:02.716
Good luck, Mr. Saru.

09:11.551 --> 09:15.163
The captain is on her way.
Let us prepare for departure.

09:15.206 --> 09:16.599
I can't believe
we're actually doing this.

09:16.643 --> 09:19.733
Book hasn't exactly given us
much of an option.

09:19.776 --> 09:22.562
He thinks he's doing the right
thing. A lot of people agree.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.346
Whatever one's opinions,

09:24.389 --> 09:26.696
we all have our orders.

09:32.702 --> 09:34.443
Hey, look who's back.

09:38.316 --> 09:40.014
You're Federation Security now?

09:40.057 --> 09:41.885
Damn.
You look great.

09:41.929 --> 09:44.888
- It's so good to see you.
- This is a wonderful surprise, Commander.

09:44.932 --> 09:48.370
Thank you, sir.
I've really missed all of you.

09:48.413 --> 09:51.852
And feel free to ignore me.
I'm just observing.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.984
Seeing how the pros do it.

09:54.028 --> 09:56.596
No, they should know.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.556
Commander Nhan is here because
of my personal connection

10:00.600 --> 10:02.123
to this mission.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.473
We need to stop Book and Tarka,
and she's going to help

10:04.516 --> 10:06.518
make sure the job is done right.

10:06.562 --> 10:08.956
I would have made
the same choice

10:08.999 --> 10:12.307
if I were
in the admiral's shoes.

10:15.527 --> 10:18.008
This isn't an easy mission.

10:18.052 --> 10:20.184
Not for any of us.

10:20.228 --> 10:23.623
But it is critical
that we succeed.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.410
Commander Owosekun, on screen.

10:30.455 --> 10:33.328
The tracker in Book's ship
tells us that they're here,

10:33.371 --> 10:35.373
hiding in this uninhabited
rogue planet.

10:35.417 --> 10:36.853
We believe they're
finishing construction

10:36.897 --> 10:38.246
on the isolytic weapon.

10:38.289 --> 10:40.596
We'll have the element
of surprise.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.729
We need to use it well.
If they manage to jump

10:42.772 --> 10:44.861
into the DMA
before we detain them,

10:44.905 --> 10:47.821
pursuit will become
much more dangerous.

10:48.909 --> 10:50.388
Black alert.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.478
Activate cloak.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.700
Let's fly.

12:42.544 --> 12:44.415
<i>
Status report.</i>

12:44.459 --> 12:46.940
<i>
Book's ship is inside a cavity</i> <i>
4,000 meters in.</i>

12:46.983 --> 12:49.507
No sensors or security
around the outside perimeter.

12:49.551 --> 12:51.205
Okay.

12:51.248 --> 12:52.728
Let's get into position.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.512
Take us as close as you can, Commander.

12:54.556 --> 12:56.601
Aye, Captain. Coming in.

12:58.473 --> 13:03.260
Stopping in three, two...

13:05.045 --> 13:07.264
...one.

13:08.091 --> 13:09.440
We're ready.

13:11.007 --> 13:12.792
Bringing Book's ship
on screen, Captain.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.405
Mr. Saru, Commander Nhan,
in my ready room.

13:17.448 --> 13:19.799
Have Dr. Culber join.

13:22.932 --> 13:26.762
Book's ship has a built-in
security disruption field,

13:26.806 --> 13:29.547
so we can't beam
directly on board,

13:29.591 --> 13:31.288
but a cloaked shuttle
can slip in

13:31.332 --> 13:33.334
close to
this maintenance hatch.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.640
That'll be our entry point.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.602
Respectfully, I'm not sure you
should be leading this mission.

13:40.645 --> 13:44.084
I wasn't planning to.
Mr. Saru will be taking point.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.826
Dr. Culber will be joining
with Commander Rhys,

13:46.869 --> 13:48.436
- and Commander Bryce will pilot.
- What about

13:48.479 --> 13:50.046
Bryce's work for Dr. Kovich?

13:50.090 --> 13:51.918
We still need
to make first contact.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.963
I'll have Zora keep looking
for communication frequencies

13:54.007 --> 13:55.791
that can pass
through the Galactic Barrier.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.575
Then Commander Bryce will
have plenty to analyze

13:57.619 --> 13:59.012
when he gets back
from the mission.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.799
- Mr. Saru, please take her through it.
- Of course, Captain.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.802
We will use a multi-phasic
signal discriminator to override

14:06.846 --> 14:09.674
external proximity sensors
and gain entrance

14:09.718 --> 14:13.591
before Mr. Booker and Tarka
are notified of our arrival.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.811
Once we make our way
to the bridge,

14:15.855 --> 14:17.813
Dr. Culber will help deescalate

14:17.857 --> 14:19.989
the situation
so we may take the ship.

14:20.033 --> 14:22.818
Book is acting out
of anger and grief.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.472
He's doing
what he thinks is right,

14:24.515 --> 14:26.169
but he's not unreasonable.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.084
Tarka's the wild card here.

14:28.128 --> 14:31.871
We will have our phasers
with us, but set to stun.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.438
Only to be used
if necessity requires.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.876
I know
you'll make the right call.

14:39.835 --> 14:42.446
Be safe.

14:56.808 --> 14:58.898
<i>
3,000 meters and closing.</i>

14:58.941 --> 15:00.725
Book will be locked up for life.

15:00.769 --> 15:02.902
He stole classified tech.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.947
He's about
to use an isolytic weapon.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.993
Because the Federation
isn't acting fast enough.

15:07.036 --> 15:09.125
You don't know what it's like
to lose everything.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.692
What do you want us to do,
launch an attack?

15:10.735 --> 15:11.911
I'm not saying
we should attack. But...

15:11.954 --> 15:13.303
Stop comparing pain, man.

15:13.347 --> 15:14.609
- You have no idea.
- Gentlemen,

15:14.652 --> 15:16.263
you are here
to execute your orders,

15:16.306 --> 15:19.440
however you may feel about them,
or one another in this moment.

15:19.483 --> 15:22.965
Listen, this is tough
for everyone.

15:23.009 --> 15:25.533
And we all have different views
on what Book's done,

15:25.576 --> 15:27.535
but we're here to fix this,

15:27.578 --> 15:29.667
and that's what we're gonna do.

15:29.711 --> 15:32.540
Together. Okay?

15:35.151 --> 15:37.066
Thank you, Dr. Culber.

15:37.893 --> 15:41.288
Prepare the shuttle
for docking, Commander Rhys.

15:41.331 --> 15:43.551
Commander Bryce, take us in.

15:43.594 --> 15:45.857
- Aye, Mr. Saru.
- Aye, Mr. Saru.

15:45.901 --> 15:49.383
<i>
Protective shielding deployed.</i>

15:49.426 --> 15:50.906
<i>
We're now at full stop</i>

15:50.950 --> 15:52.386
<i>two meters</i> <i>
from the maintenance hatch.</i>

15:52.429 --> 15:54.127
<i>Engaging airlock field.</i>

15:54.170 --> 15:56.912
Commander Owosekun, isolate the
shuttle's cloaking signature.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.088
Aye, Captain.

16:01.264 --> 16:03.223
The shuttle's soft dock
is complete, Captain.

16:03.266 --> 16:05.747
No response
from Booker's proximity sensors.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.270
They don't seem
to know we're here.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.272
Proceed, Mr. Saru.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.535
<i>
Commander Rhys, prepare</i> <i>
the signal discriminator.</i>

16:11.579 --> 16:12.972
Are you good?

16:15.713 --> 16:18.020
Captain, something's not right.

16:18.064 --> 16:20.196
[soft, skittering sound] <i>
Disco Two, report!</i>

16:20.240 --> 16:21.589
<i>Saru?</i>

16:21.632 --> 16:23.330
Something is on the shuttle, Captain.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.987
Like, all over the shuttle.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.779
I've never heard an alarm
like this on my ship.

16:37.822 --> 16:39.607
It's our new defense system.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.348
It's just a little something
I threw together

16:41.391 --> 16:42.697
on our way to Porathia.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.612
Without telling me?

16:44.655 --> 16:46.222
We were buying
banned weapons tech

16:46.266 --> 16:47.571
from an underworld market.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.965
It's an intrusion warning.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.749
It's one
of <i>Discovery's</i> shuttles.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.969
Michael must've slipped
a tracker on the isolynium.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.666
Did you know
his ship could do that?

16:55.710 --> 16:57.277
No. Commander Owosekun,
can you beam them back?

16:57.320 --> 17:00.062
I can't. Too much interference
from the disruption field.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.412
- I'm losing comms, Captain.
- Saru, you need to abort!

17:02.456 --> 17:03.935
Understood, Captain.

17:03.979 --> 17:05.981
Commander Bryce,
get us back to <i>Discovery.</i>

17:06.025 --> 17:07.243
I'm trying, sir.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.637
You need to stop it!
They'll be killed!

17:09.680 --> 17:11.204
I designed the system
to be autonomous.

17:11.247 --> 17:12.292
They'll be dead before I can

17:12.335 --> 17:13.510
even reprogram the first layer.

17:13.554 --> 17:14.990
Come on!
We've got to do something!

17:15.034 --> 17:17.210
We're stuck!
I-I can't disengage!

17:17.253 --> 17:21.779
<i>
Structural</i> <i>integrity compromised.</i>

17:21.823 --> 17:23.999
Fire an EMP charge
through the hull.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.132
Might slow it down enough
for the shuttle to break free.

17:26.175 --> 17:27.829
Got it.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.657
Owosekun, how much time
do they have left?

17:29.700 --> 17:31.354
Hull integrity down
to ten percent.

17:31.398 --> 17:33.269
<i>
Oxygen levels</i> <i>
are dropping, Captain.</i>

17:33.313 --> 17:35.184
Discovery <i>shuttle,</i> <i>
ready thrusters</i>

17:35.228 --> 17:36.664
<i>- to blast yourselves free.</i>
- Book?

17:36.707 --> 17:38.753
Captain, there's
a massive electromagnetic

17:38.796 --> 17:40.276
surge coming from Book's ship.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.973
Saru, maximum thrusters!

17:42.017 --> 17:43.932
<i>- Now!</i>
- Go, Mr. Bryce.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.025
<i>
Hull breach imminent.</i>

17:50.069 --> 17:52.897
<i>Saru!</i>
- We are trying, Captain.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.336
Come on. Get out of there.

17:56.379 --> 17:57.467
Can you get a lock now?

17:57.511 --> 17:58.860
I'm working on it, Captain.

17:58.903 --> 18:00.992
<i>
The shuttle's breaking apart.</i>

18:01.036 --> 18:04.213
<i>Owosekun?</i> <i>
- Almost got them.</i>

18:13.266 --> 18:14.789
Is everyone all right?

18:14.832 --> 18:16.791
We are, indeed.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.185
Thank you all
for your assistance.

18:19.228 --> 18:21.491
Okay, let's get back
to stations.

18:21.535 --> 18:23.493
Commander Bryce, let me know
what you find with Dr. Kovich.

18:23.537 --> 18:24.886
Aye, Captain.

18:24.929 --> 18:28.585
Captain,
we just lost the tracker signal.

18:29.369 --> 18:32.807
It's probably because
they found it. Hail him.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.809
<i>
Did everyone make it off</i> <i>
in time?</i>

18:34.852 --> 18:38.334
- Yes. Book, listen... <i>
- I'm sorry, Michael.</i>

18:38.378 --> 18:39.727
<i>I have a job to do.</i>

18:39.770 --> 18:41.468
They jumped, Captain.

18:41.511 --> 18:43.557
- He's gone.
- Damn it.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.254
They're going to the DMA.

18:45.298 --> 18:47.169
Then so are we.

18:47.213 --> 18:48.910
We cannot allow them
to destroy that controller.

18:48.953 --> 18:52.566
We cannot let our first contact
with Species Ten-C

18:52.609 --> 18:54.394
be an act of aggression.

18:54.437 --> 18:56.091
Not if we want peace.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.659
We have no idea
where the controller is.

18:58.702 --> 19:01.314
We don't know what exactly
we'll find when we jump in,

19:01.357 --> 19:04.839
so let's be prepared
for anything.

19:04.882 --> 19:07.233
Black alert.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.780
Shields up.

19:32.823 --> 19:35.696
And let's find that controller
before they do.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.439
If we beat them to it,
what then?

19:39.482 --> 19:42.137
How do you plan on stopping them
from using their weapon?

19:42.181 --> 19:45.140
Figuring that out
is next on my list.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.447
Captain,
dark matter interference

19:47.490 --> 19:49.449
is greater than expected.

19:49.492 --> 19:50.711
Cloaking will be spotty,
at best.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.060
It's impacting
shield stability.

19:52.103 --> 19:53.801
Scanning range is limited,
as well.

19:53.844 --> 19:55.933
It's like finding
a needle in a haystack,

19:55.977 --> 19:57.283
as my grandma used to say.

19:57.326 --> 19:59.633
Mr. Booker will be facing
similar challenges.

19:59.676 --> 20:01.287
Yes, but he has a head start.

20:01.330 --> 20:02.940
Detmer,
plot a grid search pattern.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.551
Aye, Captain. Owosekun,

20:04.594 --> 20:07.206
scan for the subspace rift
around the DMA controller.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.164
Given its size,
it should be easier

20:09.208 --> 20:10.644
to find than the device itself.

20:10.687 --> 20:11.819
Aye, Captain.

20:11.862 --> 20:14.865
Captain, Mr. Saru,

20:14.909 --> 20:17.999
I need to request
that we speak privately.

20:19.696 --> 20:22.003
Commander Nilsson,
you have the conn.

20:26.703 --> 20:29.402
My orders were to let you carry
out this tactical operation

20:29.445 --> 20:31.142
without intervening.

20:31.186 --> 20:33.667
If it failed,
I was to give you this briefing.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.974
There's a vulnerability that'll
allow us to disable Book's ship

20:37.018 --> 20:39.063
before
they can fire their weapon.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.848
I know Book's ship.
It's airtight.

20:40.891 --> 20:43.154
Not with the prototype
spore drive, it isn't.

20:43.938 --> 20:47.028
If we fire a photon torpedo
at the impulse manifold,

20:47.071 --> 20:49.030
the detonation will cause
a chain reaction,

20:49.073 --> 20:51.162
hit a weak spot in the drive

20:51.206 --> 20:53.295
and destroy the whole thing.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.254
With all the interference here,

20:55.297 --> 20:57.125
we wouldn't be able
to beam them out.

20:58.126 --> 21:00.041
Which is why it's a last resort.

21:00.084 --> 21:02.435
If the explosion sets off
the isolytic weapon,

21:02.478 --> 21:05.264
it could destroy <i>Discovery</i>
in the process.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.353
Not if we can jump away first.

21:07.396 --> 21:09.180
If?

21:09.224 --> 21:12.749
Billions of lives will be saved
either way.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.839
Look, I'm sorry about Book,

21:15.883 --> 21:17.145
and I know the options
aren't pleasant...

21:17.188 --> 21:19.060
It isn't just about Book
or <i>Discovery.</i>

21:19.103 --> 21:21.149
The Federation needs
that spore drive.

21:21.192 --> 21:23.325
We have to at least
consider this.

21:23.369 --> 21:26.023
There's too much at stake.
If there's any other way...

21:26.067 --> 21:28.330
And if you wait too long
to realize there isn't?

21:28.374 --> 21:31.899
- That won't happen. And I will not let you...
- I'm authorized

21:31.942 --> 21:33.117
to relieve you of command
and issue the order...

21:33.161 --> 21:34.336
I will not let you
take over my ship

21:34.380 --> 21:36.295
- while I safely weigh...
- Please. Please.

21:36.338 --> 21:37.948
If I may.

21:39.341 --> 21:42.518
Dr. Culber offered
some sage advice earlier.

21:42.562 --> 21:44.259
That in times of division,

21:44.303 --> 21:47.523
we identify that upon
which we can agree.

21:47.567 --> 21:51.832
A shared goal, perhaps,
that can lead to compromise.

21:51.875 --> 21:53.921
You're right.

21:53.964 --> 21:56.010
We need to find middle ground

21:56.053 --> 21:58.186
between us, and with Book.

22:00.928 --> 22:03.234
A shared goal.

22:04.497 --> 22:05.454
Engineering.

22:05.498 --> 22:07.108
<i>Stamets.</i>

22:07.151 --> 22:09.371
I'm working fast as I can
to increase the scanning range.

22:09.415 --> 22:12.113
Put Reno on it.
I need you for something else.

22:12.156 --> 22:14.028
<i>Check my logic here.</i>

22:14.071 --> 22:15.508
If you needed something,

22:15.551 --> 22:17.292
you wouldn't stop
until you got it, right?

22:17.336 --> 22:19.120
Or at least
until you had no choice

22:19.163 --> 22:21.296
but to move on
and look somewhere else for it.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.168
I... have no idea
what you're talking about.

22:24.212 --> 22:25.605
Boronite.

22:25.648 --> 22:27.258
That's what the DMA is mining,

22:27.302 --> 22:29.086
and they wouldn't leave an area

22:29.130 --> 22:30.914
until the boronite
in that area was exhausted.

22:30.958 --> 22:32.481
So if we scan

22:32.525 --> 22:34.222
<i>for the remaining boronite</i> <i>
in this subsector...</i>

22:34.265 --> 22:36.224
We can calculate
the rate of consumption

22:36.267 --> 22:39.401
and predict how much longer
before the DMA jumps again.

22:39.445 --> 22:40.794
<i>Exactly.</i>

22:40.837 --> 22:42.404
Ah, but the, uh,
margin of error.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.275
I don't have
a large enough sample size.

22:44.319 --> 22:46.626
Work with Zora to build a model
based on what we've got.

22:46.669 --> 22:48.367
If we can get a timetable,
we might be able

22:48.410 --> 22:49.977
to use it to get Book
to stand down.

22:50.020 --> 22:51.631
<i>
On it.</i>

22:51.674 --> 22:52.936
We should call the admiral.

22:52.980 --> 22:55.025
Let's do it together.

22:58.202 --> 23:00.857
Any sign of the controller?
Not yet.

23:00.901 --> 23:02.206
And with all the interference,

23:02.250 --> 23:04.470
our cloak keeps going
in and out.

23:06.036 --> 23:07.647
Listen. About the shuttle...

23:07.690 --> 23:09.605
They almost died.

23:09.649 --> 23:11.607
I'm sorry.

23:11.651 --> 23:14.828
This mission is ten years
in the making for me.

23:14.871 --> 23:17.396
I need this to work.

23:17.439 --> 23:20.921
And I understand very well
what all this means to you.

23:20.964 --> 23:23.576
With <i>Discovery</i> in the way,

23:23.619 --> 23:25.578
there will come a point

23:25.621 --> 23:28.450
when you have to decide
what's more important--

23:28.494 --> 23:32.149
your feelings for them,
or stopping the DMA.

23:34.238 --> 23:36.632
Don't go behind my back again.

23:37.981 --> 23:40.244
- Finish the weapon.
- It is finished.

23:40.288 --> 23:42.377
I asked you five minutes ago
where to load it,

23:42.421 --> 23:44.161
and you were too distracted
to hear me.

23:44.205 --> 23:46.120
Torpedo Tube Six.

23:48.252 --> 23:50.429
I'll continue scanning
for the controller.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.176
Sensors are picking up
an energy spike.

23:59.220 --> 24:01.004
Is it the controller?

24:01.048 --> 24:02.658
I-I can't tell.

24:02.702 --> 24:04.617
It's an object of some kind.

24:06.575 --> 24:08.751
Booker's ship dead ahead!

24:08.795 --> 24:10.013
Ten degrees hard to port!

24:10.057 --> 24:12.146
Aye, Captain.

24:17.281 --> 24:18.979
I knew
you were out here somewhere.

24:19.022 --> 24:20.589
We have a shot.
We could take it.

24:20.633 --> 24:22.417
Or we could burn out
Book's scanners,

24:22.461 --> 24:24.245
make it impossible for them
to find the controller.

24:24.288 --> 24:27.248
Rhys, launch a full spread
of sensor-blinding bursts

24:27.291 --> 24:29.206
at Book's ship as we pass,

24:29.250 --> 24:31.470
- maximum energy yield.
- Aye, Captain.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.475
Where did they come from?

24:39.652 --> 24:41.436
She's trying
to blind our scanners.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.872
Well done, them.

24:42.916 --> 24:44.526
Scanner function's down to 40%.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.746
- Can you fix it?
- Yes, but not if they hit us again.

24:46.789 --> 24:49.313
They won't.
See the hydrogen cloud ahead?

24:49.357 --> 24:51.577
We're gonna give them a taste
of their own medicine.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.317
Book just fired something
in the direction

24:53.361 --> 24:54.841
of that hydrogen cloud.

24:54.884 --> 24:57.452
A magnesium charge.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.498
He's going to ignite it
in 20 seconds.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.543
- How do you know that?
- We had a run-in with pirates

25:01.587 --> 25:04.415
in Breen space, back in the day.
He pulled the same move.

25:04.459 --> 25:06.069
Detmer, take us toward it.

25:06.113 --> 25:07.593
Captain,
with compromised shields,

25:07.636 --> 25:09.551
the heat blast will burn out
our thermal regulators.

25:09.595 --> 25:11.118
We will avoid the blast
if we dive in low,

25:11.161 --> 25:12.336
and that'll blind Book
long enough

25:12.380 --> 25:13.642
for us to get out of here.

25:13.686 --> 25:16.123
Detmer, on my mark,
full power astern,

25:16.166 --> 25:17.907
adjust course,
1-8 mark 4.

25:17.951 --> 25:20.431
Aye, Captain.
Here comes the blast.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.609
Now!

25:31.617 --> 25:34.054
Take us into that dark matter
dust cloud,

25:34.097 --> 25:35.708
20 degrees off
our starboard beam.

25:35.751 --> 25:37.144
Once we're in,
resume the grid search.

25:37.187 --> 25:38.362
Aye, Captain.

25:38.406 --> 25:40.495
That was an act of aggression.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.932
He knew whatever damage
would be temporary.

25:42.976 --> 25:45.239
We're not out of options yet.

25:46.153 --> 25:48.547
Where'd they go?

25:48.590 --> 25:50.549
The Breen gambit.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.899
- She's got a good memory.
- What does that mean?

25:52.942 --> 25:54.161
And why the hell
are you laughing?

25:54.204 --> 25:55.423
There's nothing funny
about this.

25:55.466 --> 25:56.903
We don't know where they went.

25:56.946 --> 26:00.167
I'm guessing somewhere
in that dark matter cloud.

26:00.210 --> 26:02.343
This isn't a game, Book.
You're costing us time.

26:02.386 --> 26:04.998
No, I'm saving our asses.
The only thing we've got going

26:05.041 --> 26:07.000
is that I know Michael's
tactics, and I know her crew.

26:07.043 --> 26:09.829
Yeah, maybe you know them too
well. Maybe that's the problem.

26:09.872 --> 26:11.352
Just fix the damn scanner

26:11.395 --> 26:13.789
so we can find the controller
before they do.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.574
Captain, I'm getting
strong sensor contact--

26:15.617 --> 26:18.185
high concentration
of galactic barrier particles.

26:18.228 --> 26:20.622
- It's the subspace rift.
- Great work, Owosekun.

26:20.666 --> 26:23.059
Detmer, set a course.
Stamets, where are we

26:23.103 --> 26:24.539
with that boronite timetable?

26:24.583 --> 26:26.323
We're working
as fast as we can.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.195
We're crunching gigaquads
of raw data.

26:28.238 --> 26:29.675
<i>Can you crunch faster?</i>

26:29.718 --> 26:32.416
Is there an acceptable answer
other than "yes"?

26:32.460 --> 26:35.419
- No.
- Then yes.

26:42.296 --> 26:43.950
<i>
That's it, Captain--</i>

26:43.993 --> 26:45.604
the DMA controller.

26:55.396 --> 26:57.616
Give us a closer look.

27:01.097 --> 27:03.578
The Ten-C don't care, do they?

27:03.622 --> 27:06.015
Churn space, take boronite.

27:06.059 --> 27:08.017
Rinse and repeat.

27:08.061 --> 27:11.934
We will stop them,
and we'll do it the right way.

27:11.978 --> 27:15.198
Won't be long before
Book's here to try <i>his</i> way.

27:15.242 --> 27:17.026
And we'll be ready.

27:17.070 --> 27:19.028
Commander Detmer, bring us in
as close as possible.

27:19.072 --> 27:23.772
I want to put ourselves between
Book's ship and that controller.

27:26.732 --> 27:30.257
And we are going to hold
as long as we possibly can.

27:39.962 --> 27:42.051
Stamets, I need that timetable.

27:42.095 --> 27:43.357
<i>
Working on it with Zora.</i>

27:43.400 --> 27:45.359
<i>Just need a little bit longer.</i>

27:45.402 --> 27:47.317
We can't keep playing
cat and mouse forever.

27:47.361 --> 27:49.015
Once they get here,
we'll need to make

27:49.058 --> 27:51.191
a decisive move, or they will.

27:51.234 --> 27:53.193
We just need
to stall long enough for Stamets

27:53.236 --> 27:55.021
to get the data I need
to talk Book down.

27:55.064 --> 27:56.849
Getting new data didn't
change his mind before.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.067
Why would it now?

27:58.111 --> 28:00.069
Because he's reasonable,

28:00.113 --> 28:01.984
and he's logical,

28:02.028 --> 28:04.465
and he really doesn't want
to see anyone hurt.

28:04.508 --> 28:08.121
I know he'll give us more time.
I know he will.

28:08.164 --> 28:09.862
We'll just need
to know how much.

28:09.905 --> 28:11.951
And what if you're wrong?

28:11.994 --> 28:14.388
Then we can find another way.

28:14.431 --> 28:17.957
We already <i>have</i> another way.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.524
We need to be ready.

28:23.832 --> 28:25.834
Commander Rhys.

28:28.358 --> 28:30.621
This tactical program...

28:30.665 --> 28:32.972
it would destroy Book's ship.

28:33.015 --> 28:35.061
We're not there yet.

28:35.104 --> 28:36.715
That's a last resort.

28:41.807 --> 28:44.940
We hope to avoid this option...
for everyone's sake.

28:44.984 --> 28:47.334
But my orders are
to prevent them from firing

28:47.377 --> 28:50.772
on that controller at any cost.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.426
Sensors are picking up
Booker's ship.

28:52.469 --> 28:53.688
He's coming in fast.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.298
Okay, he'll have to decloak

28:55.342 --> 28:56.691
to get a target lock.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.520
Maintain our cloaking
as best as you can.

28:59.563 --> 29:01.304
Drop it on my mark.

29:01.348 --> 29:03.263
Aye, Captain.

29:03.306 --> 29:06.048
Stamets, let Zora take over.

29:06.092 --> 29:07.571
I need you to jump.

29:07.615 --> 29:11.619
It's genius. The controller.

29:12.881 --> 29:14.709
This is going to work.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.407
What we're doing
is really going to work.

29:17.451 --> 29:19.105
Is the weapon loaded?

29:19.148 --> 29:20.541
On your mark.

29:20.584 --> 29:21.542
<i>
Warning.</i>

29:21.585 --> 29:23.196
<i>Proximity alert.</i>

29:23.239 --> 29:26.112
Damn it. They found us,
and they're blocking our shot.

29:26.155 --> 29:27.504
Can you beam it in?

29:27.548 --> 29:29.071
I'll have to lower
the disruption field.

29:29.115 --> 29:31.117
- They'd be able to beam us out.
- Well, go around them.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.727
Jump!

29:37.514 --> 29:39.516
Stamets, get ready
to jump again.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.127
Detmer, stay between him
and that controller.

29:41.170 --> 29:43.825
Do not let them get a clean shot.
Aye, Captain.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.000
You had a shot
at the controller.

29:45.044 --> 29:46.393
You should have taken it.

29:46.436 --> 29:47.786
We have one weapon.
We can't afford to miss.

29:47.829 --> 29:49.918
I'm gonna warn them off.
Target their shields.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.444
Shields down to 50%, Captain.

29:54.488 --> 29:55.837
Captain...
- He's not trying to hurt us,

29:55.881 --> 29:57.143
just warn us off.

29:57.186 --> 29:58.884
We can argue semantics
all we want, but I think

29:58.927 --> 30:02.235
we can both agree
that Book is shooting at us.

30:03.627 --> 30:06.413
- Rhys, return fire.
- Aye, Captain.

30:11.984 --> 30:14.595
So, how long are you planning
on letting them hit us?

30:14.638 --> 30:17.772
She's doing the same thing
we are-- warning us off.

30:19.121 --> 30:21.254
Look, I know you love her,

30:21.297 --> 30:23.996
I know you care for her crew,
but this needs to stop.

30:24.039 --> 30:26.215
You want to go to some home
in another universe.

30:26.259 --> 30:27.913
I lost my entire home here.

30:27.956 --> 30:30.002
Don't you dare tell me
how to do this.

30:30.045 --> 30:32.265
I'm firing another round
of warning shots,

30:32.308 --> 30:34.310
then we jump again. Get ready.

30:42.057 --> 30:43.885
Damn it! Enough!

30:43.929 --> 30:45.495
No!

30:53.895 --> 30:57.290
That was a full spread
of quantum torpedoes.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.595
Shields down to 20%.

30:58.639 --> 31:00.075
Give the order
or I will, Captain.

31:00.119 --> 31:01.990
There is no way Book was
responsible for that attack.

31:02.034 --> 31:04.775
It doesn't matter. I lost half
my team on my last mission

31:04.819 --> 31:07.387
waiting too long to make a call
I knew needed to be made.

31:07.430 --> 31:08.954
I will not let that
happen again.

31:08.997 --> 31:11.521
You said it yourself.
The stakes are too high.

31:11.565 --> 31:13.915
It's time.

31:16.048 --> 31:17.876
I fear she may be right.

31:33.543 --> 31:36.285
<i>
Captain, we've finished</i> <i>
our calculations.</i>

31:36.329 --> 31:39.723
<i>It should take 154 hours--</i> <i>
about a full week--</i>

31:39.767 --> 31:41.247
<i>before the DMA gets</i> <i>
all the boronite in this area</i>

31:41.290 --> 31:42.988
<i>and jumps again.</i>

31:43.031 --> 31:44.424
Great work.

31:44.467 --> 31:47.035
Lieutenant Christopher,
hail Book's ship.

31:49.516 --> 31:50.952
No response, Captain.

31:50.996 --> 31:53.650
Keep trying.
Commander Rhys...

31:55.217 --> 31:57.089
I want you to obey the order

31:57.132 --> 31:59.395
if Commander Nhan gives it.

32:02.268 --> 32:04.531
Mr. Saru, you have the conn.

32:04.574 --> 32:07.882
Commander Nhan, with me.

32:11.277 --> 32:14.367
With your team,
how many lives did you save?

32:14.410 --> 32:16.499
- I don't understand.
- How many?

32:16.543 --> 32:18.937
115.

32:19.720 --> 32:23.245
Not too long ago, I made
a choice that saved lives, too.

32:23.289 --> 32:25.204
In the process, I lost others.

32:25.247 --> 32:28.511
As leaders, we see success
or failure, right or wrong,

32:28.555 --> 32:31.558
but it's never that binary.
Nothing is.

32:31.601 --> 32:33.647
There is a middle ground here.

32:33.690 --> 32:36.737
And I know
that I can get Book to see it.

32:36.780 --> 32:39.522
I just have to make him look.

32:39.566 --> 32:41.307
What can you do,
put on an EV suit

32:41.350 --> 32:42.699
and pound on his viewscreen?

32:42.743 --> 32:44.223
I was thinking more
fly a shuttle

32:44.266 --> 32:46.442
in front of his viewscreen.

32:48.705 --> 32:51.621
If they try to launch
their weapon, we will fire.

32:53.058 --> 32:55.060
You won't survive.

32:55.103 --> 32:57.149
I believe in Book.

32:57.192 --> 32:59.673
But if I'm wrong,
if anything happens,

32:59.716 --> 33:02.241
I know you'll save my team.

33:02.284 --> 33:04.504
Your team.

33:06.549 --> 33:08.943
Good luck, Michael.

33:26.656 --> 33:28.615
<i>
We are standing by, Captain.</i>

33:28.658 --> 33:30.486
Commander Rhys is locked
on target.

33:30.530 --> 33:32.271
<i>
Understood.</i>

33:33.098 --> 33:35.100
Touch the console again,
and I'll take your hands off.

33:35.143 --> 33:37.276
We came here
to put a stop to the DMA.

33:41.236 --> 33:43.021
Shuttle, identify yourself.

33:43.064 --> 33:45.414
<i>
Book, it's me.</i>

33:45.458 --> 33:47.851
Michael.

33:49.201 --> 33:51.638
Commander Rhys, stand by.

33:51.681 --> 33:53.161
Aye, Commander.

34:05.391 --> 34:07.828
<i>
You haven't been answering</i> <i>
our hails.</i>

34:07.871 --> 34:10.091
<i>
Been a little busy.</i>

34:10.135 --> 34:12.311
<i>Impressive maneuvering,</i> <i>
by the way.</i>

34:12.354 --> 34:14.008
<i>
You, too.</i>

34:15.053 --> 34:18.839
<i>Book, we can't go on</i> <i>
like this.</i>

34:20.623 --> 34:23.017
If we keep digging in
on our own sides,

34:23.061 --> 34:27.195
we'll keep battling each other
and not the real threat.

34:27.239 --> 34:30.111
<i>I know you get that.</i>

34:30.155 --> 34:32.983
You said you wished
there was a middle ground?

34:33.027 --> 34:35.073
I do.

34:35.899 --> 34:37.423
I'm sending you new data.

34:38.206 --> 34:41.470
<i>Now, given the rate</i> <i>
the DMA is mining boronite,</i>

34:41.514 --> 34:43.516
<i>we expect it to remain</i> <i>
in this uninhabited area</i>

34:43.559 --> 34:45.126
<i>of space for another week.</i>

34:45.170 --> 34:48.782
No lives will be in danger
during that time.

34:48.825 --> 34:52.829
<i>And what I'm about to propose</i> <i>
is a plan President Rillak</i>

34:52.873 --> 34:54.918
<i>and Admiral Vance both approved.</i>

34:54.962 --> 34:57.051
You stand down for the week,

34:57.095 --> 34:58.705
<i>you come aboard</i> Discovery,

34:58.748 --> 35:00.707
<i>- we hold you there.</i>
- Hold us?

35:00.750 --> 35:02.491
Not in the brig.

35:02.535 --> 35:06.452
Just there, for safety's sake,
and it's just one week.

35:06.495 --> 35:09.890
<i>And the Federation uses
that time to make first contact</i>

35:09.933 --> 35:11.892
and work to convince
whoever created this thing

35:11.935 --> 35:13.850
to withdraw it.

35:13.894 --> 35:16.462
<i>And if that fails,</i>

35:16.505 --> 35:20.118
they'll back your plan
to destroy the controller.

35:24.339 --> 35:26.820
<i>
Privacy settings activated.</i>

35:26.863 --> 35:28.387
We can't take this deal.

35:28.430 --> 35:31.216
You lost voting rights
when you fired those torpedoes.

35:31.259 --> 35:33.653
We both have so much
at stake here.

35:33.696 --> 35:35.307
You can't just decide to...

35:35.350 --> 35:37.091
It's a viable compromise.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.397
Or it's a lie!

35:38.440 --> 35:40.616
She would say anything
to get you to back off.

35:40.660 --> 35:43.793
I trust Michael. Completely.

35:45.099 --> 35:47.232
And it's the right choice.

35:47.275 --> 35:50.713
I need that power source.
I need to go home.

35:50.757 --> 35:53.760
Book...

35:53.803 --> 35:57.024
Don't do this. Please.

36:01.985 --> 36:04.727
We'll stand down for a week.

36:07.991 --> 36:10.690
<i>
Thank you.</i>

36:12.474 --> 36:14.563
<i>Discovery,</i>

36:14.607 --> 36:16.435
I'm on my way back.

36:16.478 --> 36:17.914
<i>Cancel black alert.</i>

36:17.958 --> 36:19.438
<i>Book and Tarka</i> <i>
are standing down.</i>

36:19.481 --> 36:21.135
<i>Prepare for them in shuttle bay.</i>

36:31.058 --> 36:35.715
Are you familiar with
the concept "expected utility"?

36:35.758 --> 36:38.152
It's a core tenet
of game theory.

36:38.196 --> 36:41.808
A mathematical method to help
determine the optimal move

36:41.851 --> 36:44.114
in a situation
where risk is high

36:44.158 --> 36:47.857
and the outcome is unclear.

36:47.901 --> 36:51.078
Such analysis can lead
to unexpected solutions.

36:51.121 --> 36:54.647
Of course, one needs
to be clear-headed

36:54.690 --> 36:57.389
to make the right move.

36:59.695 --> 37:01.001
What are you doing?

37:01.044 --> 37:03.786
- I'm being clear-headed.
- No!

37:03.830 --> 37:05.745
Captain,

37:05.788 --> 37:07.834
they lowered
the disruption field.

37:07.877 --> 37:09.618
I'm reading
a transporter signature.

37:09.662 --> 37:12.404
And a massive tachyon surge
inside the DMA controller.

37:12.447 --> 37:15.102
Michael, Tarka beamed the weapon <i>
into the controller.</i>

37:15.145 --> 37:17.191
<i>It'll go off any second!</i> <i>
You have to move!</i>

37:17.235 --> 37:19.454
Can we do anything?
Can we stop it?

37:19.498 --> 37:21.500
I do not believe so, Captain.

37:21.543 --> 37:24.764
The detonation will stretch
half a parsec. We need to go.

37:24.807 --> 37:26.026
Not until I know they're safe.

37:26.069 --> 37:27.506
The null-space bubble

37:27.549 --> 37:29.203
will protect the internal
power source, not us.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.901
We're waiting until they jump.

37:36.950 --> 37:38.386
You tried. Let's go.

37:38.430 --> 37:41.346
Damn it. Black alert!
Jump! Now!

37:58.450 --> 38:01.670
I understand it was a risk,
but it needed to be done.

38:01.714 --> 38:04.064
And it worked.

38:04.804 --> 38:07.372
Everyone's safe.
The DMA's gone.

38:07.415 --> 38:09.896
No more worlds
will be destroyed.

38:09.939 --> 38:12.551
You can go back,
I can go home.

38:12.594 --> 38:15.815
Once we get the power source...

38:19.035 --> 38:21.429
I just need to find it.

38:24.389 --> 38:26.129
No.

38:26.173 --> 38:28.567
No, it's here. It has to be.

38:28.610 --> 38:31.309
It's not here!

38:33.267 --> 38:35.313
Tarka.

38:45.975 --> 38:49.022
It's powered from the other side
of the wormhole.

38:50.458 --> 38:52.808
Outside the galaxy.

39:08.476 --> 39:10.522
Come.

39:12.045 --> 39:14.395
Any word from Book?

39:15.831 --> 39:17.964
I keep hailing.

39:18.007 --> 39:20.967
He won't answer.

39:21.010 --> 39:23.273
What happens now?

39:23.317 --> 39:26.233
We have no idea
how the Ten-C will respond, so,

39:26.276 --> 39:28.104
the admiral's implementing
emergency protocols

39:28.148 --> 39:29.628
in case of retaliation.

39:29.671 --> 39:31.847
We're fast-tracking
the first contact mission.

39:31.891 --> 39:33.675
Commander Bryce is still
looking for ways

39:33.719 --> 39:35.982
to communicate
through the Galactic Barrier.

39:36.025 --> 39:38.071
The rest of us leave tomorrow.

39:38.114 --> 39:40.073
Did you say your goodbyes?

39:40.116 --> 39:43.250
They made me promise
I won't be a stranger.

39:43.293 --> 39:45.861
I'm going to hold you
to that, too.

39:45.905 --> 39:48.168
Please.

39:53.042 --> 39:56.089
Thank you for supporting me...

39:56.132 --> 40:00.049
reaching out to him
one last time.

40:01.964 --> 40:04.489
What you said earlier--

40:04.532 --> 40:07.100
how nothing's ever
black and white--

40:07.143 --> 40:10.146
I actually did find my family.

40:11.147 --> 40:13.672
Most live in this one village.

40:13.715 --> 40:16.762
So I went to a park there.

40:16.805 --> 40:21.854
There were kids playing
and parents hovering.

40:21.897 --> 40:23.246
Same as my parents did.

40:23.290 --> 40:26.032
I tried to talk to them, but...

40:26.075 --> 40:28.904
there was so much
I couldn't say.

40:30.079 --> 40:32.560
That I'm from the past,
for starters.

40:33.822 --> 40:38.479
So, I figured, if I couldn't
be fully honest with them...

40:38.523 --> 40:41.351
Like with us? Hmm.

40:41.395 --> 40:44.267
You couldn't tell us
you were back in uniform, so...

40:44.311 --> 40:48.446
All or nothing? That's me.

40:49.272 --> 40:53.538
Anyhow, I think it's time
for me to get okay

40:53.581 --> 40:56.236
with some middle ground.

40:56.279 --> 40:58.325
Hmm.

40:59.500 --> 41:03.286
I'd love to come back
to <i>Discovery</i> one of these days.

41:03.330 --> 41:06.246
- If that's okay?
- Oh, you always have a home here.

41:07.029 --> 41:09.510
Good luck out there.

41:09.554 --> 41:11.991
You, too.

41:24.699 --> 41:26.484
Mr. Saru.

41:26.527 --> 41:30.400
Long day.
How are you holding up?

41:30.444 --> 41:32.751
Ah, as well as could be
expected, all things considered.

41:32.794 --> 41:36.972
I wanted to commend you
for your calm

41:37.016 --> 41:39.018
during today's mission.

41:39.061 --> 41:40.759
I only wish
we'd found success.

41:40.802 --> 41:42.412
Yeah.

41:42.456 --> 41:45.546
I, uh-- considering
what we're dealing with--

41:45.590 --> 41:47.896
feel silly
bringing this up, but

41:47.940 --> 41:52.248
I'm in need of advice
on how best to respond to...

41:52.292 --> 41:55.251
an overture
from President T'Rina.

41:56.035 --> 41:58.298
An overture?

41:59.560 --> 42:03.433
She asked me
to join her for dinner.

42:04.870 --> 42:07.481
Uh... socially.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.875
- Oh.
- Uh, of course, I cannot,

42:09.918 --> 42:12.965
given the mission at hand,
but I'm unsure how best

42:13.008 --> 42:15.620
to convey that,

42:15.663 --> 42:18.231
even if it were possible,

42:18.274 --> 42:22.191
I would... decline.

42:22.235 --> 42:25.107
We-- she and I--

42:25.151 --> 42:28.284
hail from vastly
different cultures.

42:28.328 --> 42:31.984
I already feel pulled
between my commitments

42:32.027 --> 42:33.986
to Kaminar and Starfleet and...

42:34.029 --> 42:36.554
Do you have feelings for her?

42:38.164 --> 42:40.949
I think...

42:40.993 --> 42:43.648
perhaps I do?

42:43.691 --> 42:47.173
With respect, sir,
in my professional opinion,

42:47.216 --> 42:49.218
you're being an idiot.

42:49.262 --> 42:51.612
Connection is always a risk,

42:51.656 --> 42:55.703
but compared to everything else
we're dealing with right now...

42:55.747 --> 42:57.923
I'd say it's one
that you can handle.

42:57.966 --> 43:00.186
Mm. Mm.

43:00.229 --> 43:01.709
<i>
Mr. Saru,</i>

43:01.753 --> 43:04.407
<i>you're requested</i> <i>
on the bridge immediately.</i>

43:05.800 --> 43:07.585
Thank you, Doctor,

43:07.628 --> 43:11.284
for that... unexpected candor.

43:16.898 --> 43:19.074
Is everything all right,
Captain?

43:19.118 --> 43:21.511
The USS <i>Mitchell</i>
is monitoring

43:21.555 --> 43:23.688
the area
where the DMA was located.

43:23.731 --> 43:25.385
They just sent this.

43:25.428 --> 43:28.649
A new DMA has appeared?

43:28.693 --> 43:32.131
In the exact same place.

43:33.088 --> 43:36.570
Then, it would seem,
like it or not...

43:36.614 --> 43:39.529
We just made first contact.
