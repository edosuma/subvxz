WEBVTT

00:06.689 --> 00:07.560
Boar's Head?

00:07.560 --> 00:09.560
More like "Bored's Head," right?

00:09.560 --> 00:11.960
I literally said that joke
to you yesterday.

00:11.960 --> 00:14.030
Yeah.
I'm stealin' it.

00:16.300 --> 00:17.500
Hey, team?

00:17.500 --> 00:18.770
Uh, gather round for a sec.

00:18.770 --> 00:20.440
Tommy! Tommy!

00:20.440 --> 00:21.700
I almost sold a sandwich.

00:21.710 --> 00:23.040
Why didn't you?
I dropped it.

00:23.040 --> 00:26.180
But I put it aside so we can
eat it later, chief.

00:26.180 --> 00:27.380
Okay, Dino.

00:27.380 --> 00:29.110
Tommy and Dino to the end!

00:29.110 --> 00:30.580
Right, right.
Okay.

00:30.580 --> 00:33.920
I'm sorry to say that
our assistant manager George

00:33.920 --> 00:35.720
passed away last night. Who?

00:35.720 --> 00:38.590
George worked here a long time
and loved his work.

00:38.590 --> 00:43.060
He even mentioned Sub Hub
six times in his suicide note.

00:43.060 --> 00:45.860
Anyway, we need someone
to take his place.

00:45.860 --> 00:47.400
What day did you start? Tuesday.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.270
Uh-huh. And you?
Wednesday.

00:49.270 --> 00:51.330
Hayley, looks like you're
our new assistant manager.

00:51.340 --> 00:53.540
But it was Wednesday
three years ago.

00:53.540 --> 00:55.540
You know we go
by day of the week, Chloe.

00:55.540 --> 00:58.070
So, it's basic stuff...
Time cards, inventory,

00:58.080 --> 01:00.340
taking George's dead body
down from the ceiling fan.

01:00.350 --> 01:02.280
Cool.
Dino, go get George down.

01:02.280 --> 01:03.480
You got it, Hayley!

01:03.480 --> 01:05.519
Hayley and Dino to the end!

01:06.420 --> 01:08.820
Uh, his hands are tied
behind his back.

01:08.820 --> 01:10.750
We sure this is a suicide?

01:10.760 --> 01:13.220

says you got a promotion.

01:50.060 --> 01:52.860
Is this true or is Jeff playing
a dirty little trick on me?

01:52.870 --> 01:54.600
Yes! They made me
assistant manager.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.870
Let him go!

01:55.870 --> 01:57.730
Oh, Hayley!

01:57.740 --> 02:01.070
I've been so disappointed in you
for so long!

02:01.070 --> 02:03.340
Completely given up on you
as a father.

02:03.340 --> 02:05.010
You what?
Oh, yeah!

02:05.010 --> 02:07.210
But now that you've
turned things around,

02:07.210 --> 02:08.610
I got you a gift.

02:08.610 --> 02:09.680
A day planner?

02:09.680 --> 02:11.480
Yeah.
And the best part?

02:11.480 --> 02:13.750
I've already
filled it out for you.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.550
"Go to work, go home.

02:15.550 --> 02:17.220
Go to work, go home.

Go to work, go home.

02:18.890 --> 02:20.490
"Go to work, go home."
Go to work, go home.

02:20.490 --> 02:22.290
Welcome to the long march.

02:22.290 --> 02:23.690
Ohh, I envy you.

02:23.700 --> 02:25.430
Just starting out
on a job you'll do

02:25.430 --> 02:27.030
for the next 40 years.

02:27.030 --> 02:30.500
The turbulent wave of life's joy
and despair will become...

02:30.500 --> 02:32.100
a flat line.

02:32.100 --> 02:34.500
Eeeeeee!

02:34.510 --> 02:35.570
What?

02:35.570 --> 02:38.040
Soon you'll be marching to work,

02:38.040 --> 02:40.180
clockin' in and out,
marching home,

02:40.180 --> 02:41.640
over and over and over.

02:41.650 --> 02:44.310
You'll be 30, 40, 50, 60.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.450
Eeeeeee!

02:46.450 --> 02:49.920
The march ends at the grave.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.120
It's just a promotion.

02:52.120 --> 02:55.190
There's that vacant stare
of a fellow marcher.

02:55.190 --> 02:58.600
Aw, man, the march!

03:00.200 --> 03:01.330
Did I make a mistake?

03:01.330 --> 03:03.070
I mean, look,
I took the promotion

03:03.070 --> 03:05.070
because, like, future is female,

03:05.070 --> 03:08.000
but what if I get trapped
in some monotonous life?

03:08.010 --> 03:10.210
Remember what
Dr. Ronson said...

03:10.210 --> 03:12.610
Sometimes your feelings
come out more clearly

03:12.610 --> 03:14.210
in free-style rap.

03:14.210 --> 03:17.410
Babe, do you want me
to drop a beat?

03:17.420 --> 03:18.750
Maybe you should.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.770
I'll be here long after you,
Gucci Mane.

03:44.780 --> 03:46.980
Gucci Mane, it's Klaus.

03:46.980 --> 03:49.510
You need to get to the studio
right now.

03:49.510 --> 03:51.180
Your girl wants me, Gucci Mane.

03:51.180 --> 03:53.980
You're getting clowned,
Gucci Mane!

03:56.460 --> 04:00.260
That was the worst Uber ride
of my life.

04:00.260 --> 04:01.590
It was a nightmare.

04:01.590 --> 04:04.130
How long did he stop
at that gas station

04:04.130 --> 04:05.000
to take a dump?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Which time?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.600
A-And what about
that fish dinner

04:07.600 --> 04:09.000
he was picking at
the whole time?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.670
He was only eating the bones!

04:12.070 --> 04:15.340
"Please let us know how
your ride with Ernie was."

04:15.340 --> 04:17.010
Ha!
One star.

04:17.010 --> 04:18.339
Him up, Steve.

04:18.339 --> 04:20.209
I-I feel bad.

04:20.209 --> 04:23.880
These guys get fired if
their rating falls below 4.6.

04:23.880 --> 04:26.420
I don't want to take fish
off his dashboard.

04:26.420 --> 04:28.280
Fine.
Give him four stars.

04:28.290 --> 04:32.150
It won't ruin his life,
but it <i>will</i> send a message.

04:33.160 --> 04:35.830
Now it's asking
how much tip to leave.

04:35.830 --> 04:36.960
Dude, dude, dude!

04:36.960 --> 04:39.130
Type a poop emoji!
Do it!

Advertise your product or brand here

04:50.040 --> 04:52.510
These guys don't march.

04:52.510 --> 04:54.980
Hayley.
No phones at work.

04:54.980 --> 04:57.450
Don't want you thinking
of the outside world.

05:07.460 --> 05:08.660
Avocado on that?

05:13.870 --> 05:15.530
<i>Go to work, go home.</i>

05:15.530 --> 05:16.530
Avocado on that?

05:18.070 --> 05:19.470
<i>Go to work, go home.</i>

05:19.470 --> 05:20.540
Avocado on that?

05:22.410 --> 05:23.670
<i>Go to work, go home.</i>

05:23.680 --> 05:24.680
Avocado on that?

05:26.280 --> 05:27.680
<i>Go to work, go home.</i>

05:27.680 --> 05:28.750
Avocado on that?

<i>Go to work, go home.</i>

05:31.550 --> 05:32.550
Avocado on that?

05:33.420 --> 05:34.890
<i>Go to work, go home.</i>

05:34.890 --> 05:35.750
Avocado on that?
<i>Go to work, go home.</i>

05:35.750 --> 05:36.690
<i>Go to work, go home.</i>

05:36.690 --> 05:37.690
Avocado on that?

05:41.160 --> 05:42.430
Aah!

05:43.630 --> 05:45.500
Avocado... Aah!

05:47.100 --> 05:49.870
And... done.

05:51.170 --> 05:52.370
Get in.

05:52.370 --> 05:54.870
I quit Sub Hub,
and now we live in your van.

05:59.010 --> 06:01.480
I did it.
I broke free.

06:01.480 --> 06:03.350
Bye-bye, Sub Hub!

06:03.350 --> 06:05.480
Smell ya later, road map!

06:05.480 --> 06:06.680
And who needs keys?

06:06.680 --> 06:08.280
All doors are open.

06:09.420 --> 06:13.020
Babe, how are we gonna
pay for stuff?

06:13.020 --> 06:15.290
Your prayers have been answered.

06:15.290 --> 06:17.430
Roger? Have you been here
the whole time?

06:17.430 --> 06:19.160
Yeah.
Have you not heard me?

06:19.160 --> 06:22.970
I've literally been playing
music back here the whole time.

06:26.240 --> 06:27.840
I know how you can
pay for stuff.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.440
You two can be van lifers.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.580
Then you monetize it.

06:31.580 --> 06:33.110
What?
I'm... I'm confused.

06:33.110 --> 06:34.110
He gets it.

06:34.110 --> 06:36.110
Van life is huge on Instagram.

06:36.110 --> 06:37.910
People show themselves
living in a van,

06:37.920 --> 06:38.980
going to cool places.

06:38.980 --> 06:40.720
They get tons of followers,

06:40.720 --> 06:41.920
and then companies sponsor them

06:41.920 --> 06:43.990
and pay for
their sunset-filled lives.

06:43.990 --> 06:45.590
Sign us up!
What's happening?

06:45.590 --> 06:46.920
Now, you'll need an agent

06:46.930 --> 06:48.990
to find those sponsors
and do the deals.

06:48.990 --> 06:50.930
And, of course, I <i>am</i> an agent.

06:50.930 --> 06:53.730
Ugh! But, honestly, honestly,
I do not have space

06:53.730 --> 06:55.330
for any new clients right now.

06:55.330 --> 06:58.730
Ugh! This is so frustrating
because I like you so much.

06:58.740 --> 07:00.070
I didn't want to like you.

07:00.070 --> 07:01.810
Come on.
Be our agent.

07:01.810 --> 07:03.140
I don't have the time!

07:03.140 --> 07:05.540
Unnngh!
Lea'me alone!

07:05.540 --> 07:07.280
I promised my wife!

07:07.280 --> 07:08.680
It can't be me!

07:08.680 --> 07:11.410
It has to be me.

07:11.420 --> 07:12.680
Damn it, I'm doing it.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.820
Great! This way,
we can stay on the road!

07:14.820 --> 07:17.490
All right!
What an exciting time for us.

07:17.490 --> 07:18.990
The three friends.

07:20.630 --> 07:24.130
I'm gonna do those deals!

07:25.500 --> 07:28.300
I say this all the time,
but I'll say it again...

07:28.300 --> 07:31.030
You can't look too good
for a Billy Joel concert.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.900
Don't forget the hat.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.840
I'll call us an Uber.

07:40.850 --> 07:42.710
"Ernie is
one minute away."

07:42.710 --> 07:43.780
Ernie?

07:43.780 --> 07:45.580
Is that the driver...?

07:45.580 --> 07:46.850
It is.

07:46.850 --> 07:48.250
I'm canceling.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.920
Try Lyft.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.920
"Ernie is
one minute away."

07:51.920 --> 07:52.990
Oh, God!

07:52.990 --> 07:54.460
He's on Lyft too!

07:54.460 --> 07:57.730
Why don't I just go on Tinder
and find a guy to drive us?

07:57.730 --> 08:02.270
Oh!
It's him!

08:02.270 --> 08:04.400
He's everywhere!

08:04.400 --> 08:05.540
I better drive.

08:05.540 --> 08:07.540
Mom, why are you on Tinder?

08:07.540 --> 08:09.740
I said I'll drive.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.810
Oh, God.
Fish!

08:16.680 --> 08:20.220
Feels light.
No bones.

08:25.890 --> 08:26.890
It's Ernie!

08:26.890 --> 08:29.160
Back in the house!

08:32.030 --> 08:33.900
What the hell was that?
I don't know!

08:33.900 --> 08:36.100
That's the first time
it's ever happened to me.

08:36.100 --> 08:37.299
Back door!

08:38.570 --> 08:39.770
The back door's locked.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.100
I'll get the key under the mat.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.110
Mom! That's the first
time that's ever happened.

08:45.110 --> 08:46.910
You gotta believe me!

08:48.910 --> 08:50.580
Is this right?

08:50.580 --> 08:51.920
Am I making yoga?

08:51.920 --> 08:53.580
I don't know, babe,
but I <i>do</i> know

08:53.590 --> 08:56.720
you're leaving footprints
all over the goddamn van!

08:57.990 --> 09:00.390
Hello?
Hales, sup!

09:00.390 --> 09:02.730
No sponsors yet,
but I got irons in the fire.

09:02.730 --> 09:04.730
We're working towards
the holy grail...

09:04.730 --> 09:06.330
Açai Incorporated.

09:06.330 --> 09:07.400
Like the berry?

09:07.400 --> 09:09.930
Like the gold mine.
It's a superfood.

09:09.940 --> 09:12.400
Throw all your regular food
in the trash.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.740
Unless it can cure the clap.

09:13.740 --> 09:16.340
Because that's
what açai did for me.

09:16.340 --> 09:18.740
In 16 hours,
I was back on the street,

09:18.740 --> 09:21.140
circulating,
just having a good time.

09:21.150 --> 09:23.010
Roger!
We need money.

09:23.010 --> 09:25.080
Then you need to make
your life brandable.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.480
I need glam shots.

09:28.350 --> 09:30.490
My "Karate Kid" bush!

09:30.490 --> 09:32.090
Eh, this looks scary.

09:32.090 --> 09:35.330
People are going to expect
exciting content from our brand.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.930
You need more speed!

09:41.700 --> 09:42.830
Aah!

09:42.830 --> 09:45.770
Go slower in the air.
You're blurry.

09:47.770 --> 09:49.370
Wah-aah!

09:49.370 --> 09:50.440
Wah!

09:50.440 --> 09:52.180
Whoa!

09:52.180 --> 09:53.780
Aah!

09:53.780 --> 09:55.110
Wah!

09:55.110 --> 09:57.380
Ohh, Jeff,
you're gonna love this...

09:57.380 --> 09:59.580
We got it on the first shot.

09:59.590 --> 10:01.120
That's great, babe.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.050
Remember how I criticized you?

10:03.050 --> 10:04.720
I was wrong.

10:11.860 --> 10:13.000
Hello?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.270
What up?!
Time for breakfast.

10:15.270 --> 10:17.930
I suggest some
Jon's Green Mill Oats,

10:17.940 --> 10:19.800
'cause they're
your first sponsor.

10:19.810 --> 10:21.400
That's super exciting, Roger!

10:21.410 --> 10:22.940
Okay, gotta go.
Rhonda!

10:22.940 --> 10:24.870
Where the [bleep] are my deals?!

10:24.880 --> 10:26.140
Jeff, get up!

10:26.140 --> 10:27.340
We gotta go to work.

10:27.350 --> 10:28.740
I thought we didn't work?

10:28.750 --> 10:29.750
We don't.
Now get up!

10:29.750 --> 10:30.950
We're gonna be late!

10:43.630 --> 10:46.630
<i>We were once trapped
working nine to five.</i>

10:46.630 --> 10:50.700
<i>But now, the only time
we worry about is the present.</i>

10:50.700 --> 10:53.570
<i>And our Raymond Roxbee watches</i>

10:53.570 --> 10:55.710
<i>always tell us the present time.</i>

10:55.710 --> 11:00.510
<i>Use code "Hayley-Jeff"
for 15% off.</i>

11:00.510 --> 11:03.510
<i>Life is fleeting,
so make each day special.</i>

11:03.520 --> 11:04.910
<i>Make time for a sunrise.</i>

11:04.920 --> 11:07.380
<i>Make time for a loved one.</i>

11:07.390 --> 11:09.320
<i>Make a permanent mark
on your life...</i>

11:09.320 --> 11:11.790
<i>with Cosmo Dry Erase Markers.</i>

11:11.790 --> 11:13.920
<i>Now with orange.</i>

11:17.130 --> 11:20.000
Mama, we're out of food.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.400
Can't we order some delivery?

11:21.400 --> 11:23.670
No.
Ernie works for every app.

11:23.670 --> 11:27.740
Now hush up.
Dinner's almost ready.

11:27.740 --> 11:29.740
The last stick of gum?

11:29.740 --> 11:32.610
But what will we eat
on Christmas?

11:32.610 --> 11:35.080
What's up,
ya gum-eatin' bastards?

11:35.080 --> 11:36.610
Sorry, I'm just riding high

11:36.610 --> 11:38.150
'cause I hired someone
off TaskRabbit

11:38.150 --> 11:39.480
to put together my bookshelf.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.690
TaskRabbit the app?
And he's coming here?

11:45.160 --> 11:47.960
That's right.
This boss owns a bookshelf.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.760
A gift from my good friend
Gucci Mane.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.160
Who are you friends with?

11:52.160 --> 11:53.830
Being a loser?

11:53.830 --> 11:56.100
Probably.

11:56.100 --> 11:58.770
Hey, who put this couch here?

12:00.040 --> 12:01.170
Tuttle?

12:01.170 --> 12:02.970
Oh, dingdoodle,

12:02.970 --> 12:05.840
this isn't my house.

12:11.250 --> 12:12.850
Babe, Vista Point, two miles.

12:12.850 --> 12:14.050
Should we check it out?

12:14.050 --> 12:15.250
Are you nuts?

12:15.250 --> 12:17.390
We need a shot
of us eating calzones

12:17.390 --> 12:19.460
on the Hoover Dam
without a care in the world

12:19.460 --> 12:20.520
by sundown!

12:20.530 --> 12:22.590
Now step on it!

12:24.530 --> 12:26.530
Not the brakes!
The gas!

12:26.530 --> 12:30.470
No! All we ever do is post
and caption and hashtag.

12:30.470 --> 12:32.800
And I'm sick of sniffing markers
all the time!

12:32.800 --> 12:35.270
I'm not making you do that.

12:35.270 --> 12:37.210
We need a break!

12:39.750 --> 12:42.150
Wow, this is beautiful.

12:42.150 --> 12:43.350
Right?
See what happens

12:43.350 --> 12:45.480
when you get off Instagram
for a while?

12:45.480 --> 12:47.080
How did you find this place?

12:47.090 --> 12:48.150
On Instagram.

12:48.150 --> 12:50.950
Thank God for Instagram.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.360
I'm so glad you made me do this.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.290
Made <i>us</i> do this, babe.

12:57.300 --> 12:58.760
Ooh, you know,
it's a little chilly.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.700
I'm gonna go snatch my serape.

13:00.700 --> 13:02.500
Snatch away, babe.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.970
What are you doing?

13:05.970 --> 13:07.170
Oh, this?

13:07.170 --> 13:09.310
Just testing...
the nature.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.980
Did it test positive
for genital lies?!

13:11.980 --> 13:13.440
What up, nomads?

13:13.450 --> 13:16.710
I got three words for you...
Ah-sigh-ee.

13:16.710 --> 13:18.850
We landed the big sponsorship.

13:18.850 --> 13:20.720
See?
It's all paying off.

13:20.720 --> 13:23.250
We can go anywhere
and do anything.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.720
Then I want to go home
and do nothing!

13:25.720 --> 13:27.520
The whole point of this
was to get away

13:27.530 --> 13:28.720
from being a worker drone,

13:28.730 --> 13:30.930
and here you are,
working like crazy.

13:30.930 --> 13:32.000
This isn't work.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.400
You're lying to yourself.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.000
What are you gonna say next?
The sky isn't blue?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.670
Whatever color it is or isn't,

13:37.670 --> 13:39.000
it's the perfect background

13:39.000 --> 13:41.410
for Señor Thomson's
Frozen Wontons.

13:41.410 --> 13:43.210
And since you can't see that,

13:43.210 --> 13:45.070
you're no help to me out here.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.280
Babe... Sorry, Jeff.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.740
You should go home.

13:47.750 --> 13:48.410
Oh.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.750
Here.
For the drive.

13:50.750 --> 13:51.880
I can't hear you.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.480
Are you asking if
I'm sleeping with the pilot?

13:53.490 --> 13:55.290
Lord knows I'm trying.

13:57.890 --> 13:59.220
Actually, no need to climb up.

13:59.220 --> 14:00.220
You can't get past me.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.760
I'm stuck, arms are jelly.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.290
So, Lance, you were right.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.890
I shouldn't have
rode in like this.

14:04.900 --> 14:06.360
I was trying to be a big shot,

14:06.360 --> 14:08.430
and, well, to be honest,
I'm in trouble.

14:08.430 --> 14:11.900
But don't panic, Lance.
Panicking won't help anybody.

14:11.900 --> 14:14.440
Lance, quick update...
I panicked and let go.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.570
So, any solution involving
the ladder, well, that's out.

14:17.580 --> 14:19.710
Now we're working on
slowing down a free-fall.

14:19.710 --> 14:23.710
The tools I have at my disposal
are a bullhorn.

14:30.290 --> 14:32.160
Can you lose the headband?

14:32.160 --> 14:33.490
It's screwing up
the green screen.

14:33.490 --> 14:35.960
Actually can't.
I have a doctor's note.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.090
Whoa-ho!

14:37.100 --> 14:38.900
First trip to the Grand Canyon?

14:38.900 --> 14:41.760
If you're gonna hike down,
make sure to bring enough water.

14:41.770 --> 14:43.430
That's how my friend died.

14:43.430 --> 14:46.700
I'm Cameron Smiles,
CEO of Açai Incorporated.

14:46.710 --> 14:48.640
How's it going?
These promos are fun.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.840
But I'm excited to get out on
the open road. You're on it!

14:51.840 --> 14:54.840
With the magic of green screen,
you can go anywhere!

14:54.850 --> 14:57.380
Why don't we head
to Wacky-kiki Beach?

14:57.380 --> 14:58.920
Mike! Give us Wacky-kiki.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.250
♪ Surf surfin' ♪

15:00.250 --> 15:01.380
♪ Beach Boys, yeah ♪

15:01.390 --> 15:02.590
I'm the big ca-hoota!

15:02.590 --> 15:04.720
See you on the half pipe,
fish tacos!

15:04.720 --> 15:06.790
It looks so good on the monitor!

15:06.790 --> 15:09.660
So we shoot everything
in front of the screen?

15:09.660 --> 15:11.260
I'm never really going anywhere?

15:11.260 --> 15:13.460
How can you say that
when you're...

15:13.470 --> 15:15.400
suddenly on the moon!

15:15.400 --> 15:17.000
Give us spacesuits, Mike!

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
Well, I guess a fake moon
beats real Sub Hub.

15:20.010 --> 15:21.340
That's my motto.

15:21.340 --> 15:23.810
So, um,
let's say we bring in Jeff.

15:23.810 --> 15:26.880
But I-I told Jeff to go home.
Good call.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.610
But you're not gonna want
new Jeff to go home.

15:29.610 --> 15:33.280
Jeff 2.0 is super hot,
super punctual,

15:33.280 --> 15:34.350
and best of all?

15:34.350 --> 15:36.150
He's 100% hologram!

15:37.360 --> 15:38.960
Wait, this guy's real?

15:38.960 --> 15:41.160
Mike, we're working
on the hologram stuff, right?

15:41.160 --> 15:43.490
Getting closer every day, boss!

15:48.700 --> 15:50.100
He's almost done.

15:50.100 --> 15:51.370
Why didn't we run?

15:51.370 --> 15:55.100
He went to his car like 10 times
to get more tools.

15:55.110 --> 15:57.770
All finished.

15:57.780 --> 16:01.240
Now to take care
of one last thing.

16:01.250 --> 16:04.110
Oh, great, you're done.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.650
Hmm.

16:05.650 --> 16:08.720
And I'm guessing
you didn't use this washer

16:08.720 --> 16:11.860
because they gave an extra one
by mistake?

16:11.860 --> 16:16.060
Hate to tell you, buddy,
but IKEA doesn't make mistakes.

16:17.260 --> 16:19.060
My hands are tied here.

16:19.060 --> 16:20.930
You're getting four stars.

16:20.930 --> 16:22.470
Four stars?

16:22.470 --> 16:24.000
It's just a washer.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.740
Back talk?
Three stars.

16:25.740 --> 16:28.000
They should write about you
in Laffy Taffy wrappers,

16:28.010 --> 16:30.340
'cause you're
a [bleep] joke, bro!

16:30.340 --> 16:31.410
Klaus, I wouldn't...

16:31.410 --> 16:32.610
This is good for us.

16:32.610 --> 16:35.080
I'm gonna eat your bones.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.880
How 'bout you bite my ass?

16:36.880 --> 16:37.910
Two stars.

16:39.550 --> 16:42.420
The curse is his now.

16:42.420 --> 16:44.220
Slit my throat?

16:44.220 --> 16:47.220
One star.

16:47.230 --> 16:49.690
Uh, what's going on?

16:49.690 --> 16:51.960
Hayley!
Something so rad happened.

16:51.960 --> 16:55.100
We signed some new talent,
and she and Jeff just gelled.

16:55.100 --> 16:58.640
Totally organic. Anyway, she's
taking your spot on the account.

16:58.640 --> 17:00.840
What?
Wait, you mean <i>my</i> account?

17:00.840 --> 17:02.910
Well, you signed ownership
over to us.

17:02.910 --> 17:06.710
<i>But</i> what if I told you
we could use you in Brazil?

17:06.710 --> 17:08.849
Real Brazil.
I'd say sign me up.

17:08.849 --> 17:11.510
No need. You already
signed the Brazil Clause.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.050
Actually,
we didn't get a signature

17:13.050 --> 17:14.250
on the Brazil Clause, boss.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.990
What?! I need that thing,
like, right now!

17:16.990 --> 17:19.520
I'll still go.
Oh, that'd be perfect.

17:19.520 --> 17:20.859
Mike, you wanna
shoot a Brazil Clause

17:20.859 --> 17:22.730
over to the printer?
Let's head to the printer.

17:22.730 --> 17:24.660
That's where
the Brazil Clause'll come out.

17:34.410 --> 17:36.610
This thing's a workhorse.

17:40.350 --> 17:44.010
All right!
We out here!

17:44.020 --> 17:45.680
What a great farm.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.820
I'm gonna get some great shots.

17:47.820 --> 17:48.820
Whoa!

17:48.820 --> 17:52.020
I know him.
He's a van lifer.

17:52.020 --> 17:53.560
And so is he.

17:55.290 --> 17:57.230
What the hell is going on here?

17:57.230 --> 17:59.360
Pick berries.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.260
Hashtag slave life.

18:03.970 --> 18:05.370
Oh, my God.

18:05.370 --> 18:07.570
Is this where Açai Incorporated

18:07.570 --> 18:09.640
sends influencers
when they get replaced?

18:09.640 --> 18:11.710
Yes.
Now go to work!

18:11.710 --> 18:12.710
Then go home?

18:12.710 --> 18:14.110
No!

18:14.110 --> 18:15.310
Only go to work.

18:15.310 --> 18:16.780
Go to work, go to work.

18:16.780 --> 18:18.450
Go to work, go to work.

18:18.450 --> 18:19.780
Welcome to the short march.

18:19.780 --> 18:22.250
Oh, man, the march!

18:27.390 --> 18:29.990
So hungry.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.360
Ooh, one left.

18:35.670 --> 18:38.600
Aah-ja-ja!

18:52.380 --> 18:55.320
Is this the pile
for medical attention?

18:55.320 --> 18:58.720
It's a death trench, dummy.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.790
This is my trench now.

19:00.790 --> 19:03.390
Hayley!
Where are you?!

19:03.400 --> 19:04.460
Jeff?

19:15.540 --> 19:18.740
Hashtag rescue!

19:23.220 --> 19:24.280
Jeff.

19:24.280 --> 19:26.220
Hey... babe.

19:26.220 --> 19:27.680
How did you find me?

19:27.690 --> 19:30.220
I follow the guy
who releases the guard monkeys

19:30.220 --> 19:31.420
on Instagram.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.890
Thank God for Instagram, right?

19:33.890 --> 19:36.890
No, Jeff.
Thank God for <i>you.</i>

19:36.900 --> 19:39.500
You... almost saved me.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.960
I'm so sorry.

19:47.510 --> 19:49.240
Oh, my God.
My arm.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.370
Açai juice really is a...

19:51.380 --> 19:53.040
Superfood!

19:55.450 --> 19:56.710
No!

19:56.720 --> 19:59.050
They're drinking
the undiluted juice!

20:07.790 --> 20:09.590
Whoa.

20:10.660 --> 20:11.730
Whoa!

20:11.730 --> 20:12.900
Aah!

20:14.070 --> 20:15.470
Whoooa!

20:24.880 --> 20:27.080
Let's get the hell outta here!

20:28.680 --> 20:30.410
I love you so much, Jeff!

20:30.420 --> 20:32.750
Superfood!

20:35.290 --> 20:37.550
Go to work, go home.

20:37.560 --> 20:39.420
Go to work, go home.

20:39.420 --> 20:41.090
Ah!
Superfood.

20:41.090 --> 20:44.290
Jeff, you can't visit me at work
until you go back to normal.
