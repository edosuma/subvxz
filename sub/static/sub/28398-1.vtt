[wine pouring]

00:08.943 --> 00:09.675
[clink]

00:19.887 --> 00:22.721
(dramatic music)

01:32.960 --> 01:34.393
- [Waylon] It's all right
to do that because--

01:34.395 --> 01:35.727
- [Nida] No, no, no, no.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.296
That's disgusting.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.000
- Eww, gross.

01:43.304 --> 01:44.470
- Yep, yep, yep.

01:45.573 --> 01:47.339
- [Nida] Oh my gosh,
your hair is so cute.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.807
- It's your first
day today, huh?

01:48.809 --> 01:50.209
- [Nida] You excited.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.043
- Yeah.

01:51.045 --> 01:51.977
- Yeah?

01:51.979 --> 01:53.479
You don't sound very excited.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.147
How was your (speaking
in a foreign language)?

01:56.050 --> 01:57.316
(laughing)

01:57.318 --> 01:58.484
Isn't that what that
little Mexican dude

01:58.486 --> 02:01.620
on Sesame Street
calls Frosted Flakes?

02:01.622 --> 02:04.523
- I don't know what is
wrong with your daddy.

02:04.525 --> 02:05.891
- [Waylon] Hey did
you get enough to eat?

02:05.893 --> 02:07.092
- Yeah.

02:07.094 --> 02:07.793
- [Waylon] Yeah, you
want anything else?

02:07.795 --> 02:08.460
- No, thanks.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.361
- No?

02:09.362 --> 02:10.261
- All right, you got
everything packed up?

02:10.264 --> 02:11.196
You ready to go?

02:11.198 --> 02:12.464
- [Justine] Um hmm.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.099
- All right, tell
bad Daddy bye.

02:14.101 --> 02:15.200
- [Waylon] Hey did
you feed your dog?

02:15.202 --> 02:16.101
- No, I did.

02:16.103 --> 02:16.969
- No?

02:18.906 --> 02:22.274
All right, easy, easy.

02:22.276 --> 02:25.144
Hey listen, you have the
best day today, okay?

02:26.247 --> 02:27.446
And we're gonna
be nice to people,

02:27.448 --> 02:28.680
and what do we do?

02:28.682 --> 02:29.915
- Make sure others
are being nice too.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.283
- And we don't pick on anyone.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.452
- Don't let on anyone
pick on anybody else.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.553
- I love you.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.688
- All right, bye daddy.

02:36.690 --> 02:37.923
- [Waylon] I'll see
you right after school.

02:37.925 --> 02:38.891
- Bye.

02:38.893 --> 02:40.192
- Love you.
- I love you.

02:40.194 --> 02:42.327
- I'll see you later.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.795
- Yes, you will.

02:43.797 --> 02:44.696
Stop.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.234
All right, let's go.

02:49.236 --> 02:50.135
Come on.

02:58.279 --> 03:01.780
- [Weatherman] Sticky and
humid with a high of 96.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.983
With the winds out of the
east at 14 miles per hour.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.419
It's currently 75 degrees.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.955
(piano music)

03:22.736 --> 03:26.338
¶ Lift your head up ¶

03:26.340 --> 03:27.406
- Hey.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.473
- [Nida] Hi.

03:28.475 --> 03:29.908
- I was just leaving.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.343
- [Nida] Okay.

03:31.345 --> 03:33.745
(sad music)

03:42.990 --> 03:45.390
- [Waylon] Here's your coffee.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.125
- [Nida] Thanks.

03:47.127 --> 03:49.528
(sad music)

04:07.581 --> 04:09.715
(crying)

04:12.019 --> 04:14.386
(sad music)

04:56.130 --> 04:57.529
- [Janet] Good morning, Waylon.

04:57.531 --> 04:58.797
- Good morning, Janet.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.465
I was just wondering
if you could tell me

05:00.467 --> 05:04.703
who send out these welcome to
the new school year letters.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.172
- I do.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.607
- You do?

05:08.609 --> 05:09.808
- I'm so sorry.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.010
It's an automated system
through the computer

05:12.012 --> 05:14.880
that prints out the
letters and the labels.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.982
- Right, right, right
but someone has to put

05:16.984 --> 05:18.750
the information in
there and take it out.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.053
Ain't you the person
in charge of that?

05:21.055 --> 05:22.287
- Yes.

05:22.289 --> 05:23.221
- [Waylon] Yeah, so
you could've taken

05:23.223 --> 05:25.190
Justine's name outta there.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.224
- I'm so sorry.

05:26.226 --> 05:27.859
- Well you know Justine's dead.

05:29.163 --> 05:31.396
You were at the funeral.

05:31.398 --> 05:32.931
- Yes--

05:32.933 --> 05:34.666
- Listen, let me tell you
what's a good fucking time

05:34.668 --> 05:37.502
is getting this in the
mail and having my wife

05:37.504 --> 05:40.539
crying because you didn't
want to do your fucking job.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.374
As if we needed another
reminder that our little girl

05:42.376 --> 05:46.011
ain't here no more,
Janet, because every
fuckin' thing does.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.212
- Waylon.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.447
- I just want to
come by this morning

05:48.449 --> 05:49.948
and say thank you
for reminding me

05:49.950 --> 05:52.718
my little girl ain't gonna
start third grade this year.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.287
- Waylon, I'm so sorry.

05:55.289 --> 05:57.155
- Have yourself a
lovely day, Janet.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.441
(country music)

06:19.380 --> 06:20.612
Yo.

06:20.614 --> 06:23.849
- Hey grab a gallon in
front of the fridge.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.521
- How much is it?

06:29.523 --> 06:31.957
- Mom said to put
it on her bill.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.458
- I'll just pay.

06:33.460 --> 06:36.194
(country music)

06:37.030 --> 06:38.530
- There's a trap in there too.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.098
- What?

06:40.100 --> 06:43.168
- Dad broke the trap in the
kitchen sink or somethin'.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.002
- Of course he did.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.704
Did he flood the house?

06:45.706 --> 06:47.239
- Mom didn't say.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.641
- I don't have time
for this shit today.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.309
- What's wrong?

06:51.311 --> 06:52.778
- Nothing, just another day.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.380
You got any?

06:55.382 --> 06:56.281
- No, I don't.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.152
Dad says hurry.

07:00.154 --> 07:01.787
He's waiting on the milk.

07:01.789 --> 07:04.523
(country music)

07:13.834 --> 07:14.666
- Hey!

07:14.668 --> 07:15.500
- Yo!

07:15.502 --> 07:16.902
- What took you so long?

07:16.904 --> 07:19.271
Can't eat without
something to drink.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.672
- They didn't have
any whole milk.

07:20.674 --> 07:21.973
They only had skim.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.743
- Oh that right there,
see that's what they get

07:24.745 --> 07:27.045
for not letting Raylene
do the ordering.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.448
That old lady that runs
the place is worthless

07:29.450 --> 07:30.949
as tits on a boar hog.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.951
- [Mom] He's just pulling
your leg, you old grump.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.252
- [Dad] It's true.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.388
- Here is your whole milk.

07:39.726 --> 07:41.960
- I wouldn't have
been surprised.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.628
- What are you doing
underneath the sink anyway?

07:43.630 --> 07:44.463
- [Dad] I was fixing it.

07:44.465 --> 07:45.430
It had a leak.

07:45.432 --> 07:46.531
- No, it did not.

07:46.533 --> 07:47.799
The thing was clogged up.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.267
It only started to
leak once you took

07:49.269 --> 07:51.436
the trap out, couldn't figure
out how to put it back in.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.305
- You've just got
it cross threaded.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.508
All right, turn the faucet on.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.178
Wow, look at that.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.012
- [Dad] Work?

08:01.014 --> 08:02.247
- Yeah of course it is.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.049
- I couldn't see what I
was doing under there.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.751
- Well that's more the
reason to leave it run.

08:06.753 --> 08:07.686
- What's the matter?

08:07.688 --> 08:09.221
- My back hurts.

08:09.223 --> 08:11.256
- Grab one of my
pills and take one.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.491
- Where they at?

08:12.493 --> 08:14.226
- Right in front of
ya on the counter.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.228
- Bring me one.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.063
- You only have three in here.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.398
- That's all right, take it.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.735
- I'll call the drugstore
and get a refill.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.470
- You've been taking more of
those than you're supposed to?

08:25.472 --> 08:28.106
- I only take what you give me.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.174
- You want me to
stop on my way home

08:29.176 --> 08:30.108
and pick 'em up for you?

08:30.110 --> 08:31.042
- No, that's all right, honey.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.377
I gotta go to town anyway.

08:32.379 --> 08:33.411
- You sure?

08:33.413 --> 08:34.880
- Yep.

08:34.882 --> 08:35.680
- All right, well call if
you need anything, all right?

08:35.682 --> 08:36.915
- Bye.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.183
- Hey stay our from
underneath that sink.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.751
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.152
Can't get these.

08:43.156 --> 08:45.957
(dramatic music)

10:31.832 --> 10:34.733
(whistle blowing)

10:37.504 --> 10:39.904
(muttering)

10:41.975 --> 10:44.376
- Hey Waylon, got a second?

10:46.079 --> 10:47.178
- I'll see you, boy.

10:54.921 --> 10:57.789
- Could you get
that door, Waylon?

11:00.627 --> 11:03.294
- What can I do for you?

11:03.296 --> 11:05.964
- I got a paper
here that I need you

11:05.966 --> 11:07.866
to have your doctor sign.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.401
- What kind of paper?

11:09.403 --> 11:11.302
- It's just a paper saying
that you have prescription.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.040
- What are you talking about?

11:15.042 --> 11:17.142
- You know your drug
test came back saying

11:17.144 --> 11:20.745
you had opioids in your
system which is fine

11:20.747 --> 11:22.580
provided that you
have a prescription.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.416
- Well I ain't got
no prescription.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.786
I mean I took a pain pill.

11:29.056 --> 11:30.055
- I understand.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.691
But you know with
these fellas, opioids

11:32.693 --> 11:34.025
can mean any number of things.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.761
So they just wanna see a script.

11:37.764 --> 11:39.664
- Well what does it mean?

11:39.666 --> 11:42.500
- No script, it means
a failed drug test.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.102
- Okay but Jimmy, I
just told you I don't

11:44.104 --> 11:46.271
have no script, so
what does it mean?

11:46.273 --> 11:48.640
- They will assume the
worst without a script.

11:49.776 --> 11:51.576
- Well I will tell
'em it's my dad's,

11:51.578 --> 11:54.045
and it's because of all
these orders right here.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.280
I mean Jimmy, when
they start cutting

11:55.282 --> 11:56.815
the ever living shit
out of them posts,

11:56.817 --> 11:59.918
it hurts my fucking back so bad
I can barely sleep at night.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.927
(dramatic music)

12:08.929 --> 12:11.329
Jimmy, have I ever missed a day?

12:11.331 --> 12:12.163
- No.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.031
- Never been late.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.734
Don't have a write
up for nothing.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.001
- I know.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.670
- I got a back that
hurts when they decide

12:18.672 --> 12:21.039
China needs a post
cut for a week.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.841
- Well you can take
the test again.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.343
We give everyone the
chance to take it again

12:25.345 --> 12:26.845
if something shows
up the first time.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.813
- Of course, I'll do
whatever they want.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.550
- Okay, okay good.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.252
You got four days.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.688
I want you to go back
and see that same doctor.

12:37.791 --> 12:41.493
And Waylon, buddy, this
one's got to be clean.

12:42.562 --> 12:43.495
- It will be.

12:45.699 --> 12:46.498
- Now go on home.

12:48.702 --> 12:49.968
- I appreciate you, Jimmy.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.336
- Good evening, Waylon.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.874
(piano music)

13:05.519 --> 13:06.417
- Toby!

13:08.755 --> 13:09.621
Here boy!

13:39.719 --> 13:42.187
(rock music)

14:00.841 --> 14:01.739
Hey babe?

14:06.613 --> 14:07.812
Hey how are you?

14:07.814 --> 14:08.713
- Hi.

14:11.818 --> 14:12.717
- How's it going?

14:13.653 --> 14:14.853
- [Nida] Good.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.926
- Thank you, darlin'.

14:23.730 --> 14:26.598
I stopped by the board of
education this morning.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.032
- Oh I know.

14:28.034 --> 14:28.933
They called me.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.302
- What are you up to?

14:31.304 --> 14:32.570
You wanna sit for a minute?

14:34.207 --> 14:36.174
- I'm just watching a show.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.275
Just gonna go to bed.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.178
- You okay?

14:40.180 --> 14:41.713
- Yeah, I'm just tired.

14:51.892 --> 14:54.559
(TV muttering)

15:09.910 --> 15:13.444
- [Waylon] I'm gonna sit
with you for a minute.

15:13.446 --> 15:16.080
(TV muttering)

15:27.861 --> 15:31.095
- [TV Announcer]
Down at the car wash.

15:33.934 --> 15:34.866
- Your feet hurt?

15:37.404 --> 15:38.903
Here I'll rub 'em for you.

15:38.905 --> 15:39.704
- Babe, don't worry about it.

15:39.706 --> 15:40.538
Just eat.

15:40.540 --> 15:41.439
- It's all right.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.909
(TV muttering)

15:49.616 --> 15:51.516
How was your day?

15:51.518 --> 15:52.417
- Fine.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.252
- Work good?

15:55.088 --> 15:55.987
- Yep.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.189
- You guys get a lot done today?

15:58.191 --> 15:59.090
- Waylon.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.795
(TV muttering)

16:09.669 --> 16:11.302
- Ow.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.570
- Sorry.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.206
(TV muttering)

16:42.435 --> 16:43.334
- Here.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.173
I think I'm just
gonna go to bed.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.008
- I'll come with you.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.109
- No, just stay.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.010
- I'm wore out, babe.

16:52.012 --> 16:52.910
- Waylon.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.146
- What's wrong?

16:55.949 --> 16:57.582
Babe, what's wrong?

16:59.219 --> 17:01.953
- I can't do this anymore.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.022
- What?

17:04.024 --> 17:04.922
- This.

17:09.696 --> 17:10.945
You.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.195
I can't be with you
like this anymore.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.231
- Babe--

17:13.233 --> 17:14.532
- I can't.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.100
- We're working on this.

17:16.102 --> 17:16.968
It's getting better.

17:16.970 --> 17:17.869
- No, no.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.271
No, we're not.

17:22.375 --> 17:26.544
Asking me how my day
was and how my job was

17:26.546 --> 17:27.678
is not communicating.

17:27.680 --> 17:28.479
It's not talking.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.081
It's small talk.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.249
I fucking hate small talk.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.151
I don't wanna talk about my day.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.085
- Babe, we can't
just keep talking

17:34.087 --> 17:36.220
about the bad shit all the time.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.456
- Please, come on, Waylon.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.660
(sad piano music)

17:51.237 --> 17:52.703
I want a divorce.

17:59.712 --> 18:02.613
(sad piano music)

18:28.708 --> 18:31.442
(country music)

18:34.681 --> 18:35.980
- [Nona] How are you, babe?

18:35.982 --> 18:37.281
- Well, well, look at you.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.650
You ain't so bad on
the country scale.

18:40.854 --> 18:42.120
- Shut up.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.654
- But you're taken
though, aren't ya?

18:43.656 --> 18:45.590
- Is that what you're sayin'?

18:45.592 --> 18:48.192
- Yeah, you really
grabbed my heart.

18:48.194 --> 18:51.496
- My god, you want the Turkey?

18:51.498 --> 18:52.997
- Yeah, that'll do it.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.837
- Are you doing all right?

18:59.839 --> 19:01.005
- Yeah.

19:01.007 --> 19:01.906
Yeah, I'm fine.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.542
- Okay, I'll be right back.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.648
(country music)

19:21.361 --> 19:23.694
Here you go.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.530
- [Waylon] Thank you.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.965
- Where's Raylene?

19:27.967 --> 19:29.433
- I don't know.

19:29.435 --> 19:32.103
I hate to break
it to you though.

19:32.105 --> 19:34.138
She really ain't gay.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.506
- Who the hell says that?

19:36.676 --> 19:39.143
God damn it, Waylon.

19:39.145 --> 19:41.712
- It's good seeing you
over there the other night.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.849
Don't worry, I ain't
gonna tell no one.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.053
- It's time for a warm up.

19:49.923 --> 19:51.055
You want one?

19:51.057 --> 19:51.956
- Yeah.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.993
You got the cream in
here tonight, don't you?

19:55.995 --> 19:58.829
- All the good boys are
home with their wives.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.398
- Is that so?

20:00.400 --> 20:01.732
- Cheers, babe.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.434
- Cheers.

20:07.607 --> 20:08.673
- I'll be back.

20:08.675 --> 20:09.574
- Thank you.

20:14.514 --> 20:17.248
(country music)

20:36.502 --> 20:37.235
Hey bud.

20:57.857 --> 21:00.558
(ominous music)

21:19.212 --> 21:22.280
(pill crunching)

21:22.282 --> 21:25.016
(ominous music)

21:46.339 --> 21:48.773
(coughing)

21:48.775 --> 21:51.242
(ominous music)

21:51.244 --> 21:53.477
(coughing)

21:53.479 --> 21:56.213
(ominous music)

22:17.036 --> 22:18.135
- What's the matter
with you, Waylon?

22:18.137 --> 22:19.270
Something wrong?

22:19.272 --> 22:20.471
- Charlie, fuck off.

22:20.473 --> 22:21.405
- Ease up, buddy.

22:21.407 --> 22:23.040
- You got a problem, Waylon?

22:23.042 --> 22:24.975
- Okay now, it's
time to go home.

22:24.977 --> 22:27.044
Come on, get outta here.

22:28.314 --> 22:31.282
(vomiting)

22:31.284 --> 22:33.584
(coughing)

22:37.724 --> 22:40.458
(ominous music)

22:53.072 --> 22:55.406
(smacking)

23:12.592 --> 23:14.859
- Mom, Waylon's up.

23:17.663 --> 23:19.029
- [Announcer] Major
focus this hour

23:19.031 --> 23:20.297
on the island of Puerto Rico.

23:20.299 --> 23:24.201
Maria hitting land as a
category four hurricane.

23:24.203 --> 23:25.369
This storm's a killer.

23:25.371 --> 23:27.705
We mentioned before
how dangerous

23:27.707 --> 23:29.006
this storm has become.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.641
FEMA administrator
Brock Long with me

23:30.643 --> 23:33.010
now live out of Washington DC.

23:33.012 --> 23:34.412
- Nida told me to move out.

23:36.616 --> 23:38.149
She wants a divorce.

23:38.151 --> 23:39.383
- [Announcer] What
are you doing?

23:39.385 --> 23:41.786
What are you hearing
about this storm now?

23:42.789 --> 23:44.021
- [Brock] So yesterday,
we were looking

23:44.023 --> 23:46.157
at a very fierce
but compact storm.

23:46.159 --> 23:47.892
- [Nida] No, I am
not doing this alone.

23:47.894 --> 23:48.826
- [Waylon] That's
what I thought.

23:48.828 --> 23:49.660
I figured this would play out

23:49.662 --> 23:51.162
just about like this.

23:51.164 --> 23:55.399
- [Nida] That's right walk
away like you always do.

23:56.436 --> 23:59.336
(sad piano music)

25:13.946 --> 25:15.179
- [Mom] Where's Waylon?

25:16.048 --> 25:17.114
- On the porch.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.422
- Okay, go on out
and talk to him.

25:26.826 --> 25:27.725
- Why?

25:28.995 --> 25:30.394
- [Mom] Would it kill
you to say something

25:30.396 --> 25:31.328
nice to your son?

25:32.832 --> 25:35.733
Just get out there
for God's sake.

25:56.389 --> 25:58.455
- Don't tell no one,
but they're gonna stock

25:58.457 --> 25:59.456
the river tomorrow.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.393
They said they're
gonna put 500 pound

26:02.395 --> 26:04.328
of fish up Back
Fork in the mornin'.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.331
- I figure the secret'll be out

26:07.333 --> 26:09.133
by the time the stock
truck goes up the road,

26:09.135 --> 26:10.701
don't you think?

26:10.703 --> 26:12.369
- Probably.

26:12.371 --> 26:13.938
They should stock in the winter.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.773
That'd keep some
fish in the water.

26:25.318 --> 26:28.986
Hey your mom wanted
me to talk to you.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.889
Wanted me to tell you
you could stay here

26:31.891 --> 26:32.990
if you needed to.

26:34.260 --> 26:37.027
Told her you'd probably
stay with Raylene.

26:38.297 --> 26:41.231
But you know you
can if you want.

26:47.640 --> 26:50.541
Well gotta go see
if the food's ready.

26:51.811 --> 26:53.243
Hey Raylene.

26:53.245 --> 26:54.144
- Hey.

26:56.282 --> 26:57.181
How are you?

26:58.184 --> 26:59.416
- [Waylon] I'm good.

26:59.418 --> 27:00.317
- Yeah?

27:01.921 --> 27:03.921
Let me see those hands.

27:05.224 --> 27:06.790
Oh, looks like it.

27:19.538 --> 27:22.172
(guitar music)

28:04.483 --> 28:06.250
- Can I get one of
your pills, Dad?

28:08.721 --> 28:10.354
- Yeah, here.

28:16.162 --> 28:17.061
- Thank you.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.500
You need anything from town?

28:23.502 --> 28:24.401
- No.

28:25.471 --> 28:26.904
- I'll be back in a bit.

28:26.906 --> 28:27.805
- Okay.

28:36.682 --> 28:37.614
- Waylon leave?

28:38.651 --> 28:39.550
- Yeah.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.053
- You didn't give him any
of your pills, did you?

28:44.390 --> 28:45.656
- I gave him one.

28:45.658 --> 28:46.924
- [Mom] Oh Bill.

28:46.926 --> 28:48.325
- [Bill] What?

28:48.327 --> 28:49.593
- And what about
you, young lady?

28:49.595 --> 28:51.628
When are you gonna
cut this shit out?

28:51.630 --> 28:53.230
- Enough with it, Mom.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.299
- [Mom] People talk, Raylene.

28:55.301 --> 28:57.501
- All right, I'm not
listening to this.

28:57.503 --> 28:58.502
- Well you think
that they don't.

28:58.504 --> 28:59.703
You think that we don't hear?

28:59.705 --> 29:00.537
- Well let's hear it.

29:00.539 --> 29:01.438
What are they sayin'?

29:03.275 --> 29:04.641
- Yeah exactly.

29:05.678 --> 29:07.478
You always worried
about what people think.

29:07.480 --> 29:09.246
- I happen to care about you.

29:19.358 --> 29:22.059
(TV gun firing)

29:42.815 --> 29:44.314
- [Nida] You want one?

29:44.316 --> 29:46.283
- [Waylon] No thank you.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.185
- [Nida] I still
haven't seen the dog.

29:48.187 --> 29:49.586
- Just keep food out,
he'll turn up in a bit.

29:49.588 --> 29:50.487
He always does.

29:51.690 --> 29:53.891
Listen I'm gonna take
the rocking chair, okay?

29:53.893 --> 29:55.459
- [Nida] Yeah, take
whatever you want.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.593
- [Waylon] That's it.

29:57.963 --> 30:00.531
- [Nida] You gonna
stay with your parents?

30:00.533 --> 30:01.832
- [Waylon] No.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.600
- [Nida] I don't
think it's a good idea

30:03.602 --> 30:05.335
to stay at Raylene's.

30:05.337 --> 30:06.370
- Well I don't have
much of a choice, do I?

30:06.372 --> 30:07.638
- Well I can help you.

30:07.640 --> 30:08.772
I mean I can help
you find a place.

30:08.774 --> 30:10.507
There's the apartments
up Back Fork.

30:10.509 --> 30:11.642
- That's okay.

30:11.643 --> 30:12.776
- You know my parents,
they also have that couch,

30:12.778 --> 30:14.478
and those side tables.

30:14.480 --> 30:15.312
It's fine.

30:15.314 --> 30:16.547
I can help you.

30:16.549 --> 30:17.481
- Listen, it's all
good, I'm good.

30:17.483 --> 30:20.484
- Would you just stop please.

30:21.854 --> 30:29.860
I mean, Waylon, don't you
wanna talk about all of this

30:29.862 --> 30:34.364
shit with it not being
a screaming fight?

30:34.366 --> 30:36.900
Don't you want to
talk about why?

30:36.902 --> 30:39.203
- Pretty obvious, ain't it?

30:42.775 --> 30:45.475
- Is that why you don't
talk about Justine

30:45.477 --> 30:47.211
'cause it's obvious she's gone?

30:47.213 --> 30:48.512
- See this is what
I ain't doin'.

30:48.514 --> 30:49.346
I'm not doing it.

30:49.348 --> 30:50.247
- You never do.

30:51.750 --> 30:52.683
Yeah, that's right.

30:52.685 --> 30:54.618
Walk away like you always do.

31:09.768 --> 31:12.336
I'm all alone, Waylon.

31:15.574 --> 31:20.544
Something, anything, I never
know what you're thinking

31:21.614 --> 31:24.348
or feeling because
you won't talk to me.

31:24.350 --> 31:25.449
- I don't want a divorce.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.717
How 'bout that?

31:26.719 --> 31:28.819
But that don't much
matter, does it?

31:28.821 --> 31:32.022
- Well I wouldn't
know what if anything

31:32.024 --> 31:33.891
affected you because
you're emotionless.

31:33.893 --> 31:37.361
It's just, it's nothing,
nothing, nothing,

31:37.363 --> 31:38.962
and then you blow up.

31:38.964 --> 31:41.131
It's like the only
emotion you know is anger.

31:41.133 --> 31:43.901
- You think I don't
care about you or this?

31:43.903 --> 31:46.870
- You're so level
until you're mad.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.141
I don't know what
you're feeling.

31:53.212 --> 31:54.544
- Maybe that was for you.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.714
Did you ever think about that?

32:00.019 --> 32:02.085
- If that was for me,
then why don't I feel

32:02.087 --> 32:03.253
so much love?

32:03.255 --> 32:04.221
- I don't know, darling,
'cause I've been

32:04.223 --> 32:05.589
right here this whole time.

32:06.959 --> 32:08.392
There ain't a whole lot of
times where what I'm thinking

32:08.394 --> 32:10.494
or feeling when you're
constantly in tears.

32:10.496 --> 32:12.562
- I have gone through
this by myself.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.765
I am drowning here.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.604
- And you're asking
me to save you

32:20.606 --> 32:21.905
when I can't swim myself.

32:22.975 --> 32:25.542
(piano music)

32:28.614 --> 32:29.947
(crying)

32:29.949 --> 32:31.615
I'm sorry you felt a lack.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.754
(crying)

32:40.726 --> 32:43.560
(dramatic music)

33:59.772 --> 34:02.105
(creaking)

34:03.042 --> 34:04.107
Ray?

34:04.977 --> 34:07.811
(dramatic music)

34:17.089 --> 34:18.622
- [Raylene] I need four 30s.

34:18.624 --> 34:20.257
- That'll be 80 bucks.

34:20.259 --> 34:21.625
- [Ralene Voiceover]
Don't have it.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.126
- [Dealer] Not
gonna pay anything?

34:23.128 --> 34:24.761
- [Raylene] Not 80.

34:26.432 --> 34:31.068
- I was hoping you weren't
gonna pay anything, Raylene.

34:32.771 --> 34:37.140
Pretty little blouse on
when I saw you drive up.

34:37.142 --> 34:40.043
(dramatic music)

34:41.246 --> 34:43.413
I like it when you do it.

34:46.685 --> 34:47.584
Yeah.

34:59.531 --> 35:02.099
(grunting)

35:02.101 --> 35:05.769
(upsetting dramatic music)

35:15.214 --> 35:17.514
(grunting)

35:22.187 --> 35:25.155
(sad violin music)

35:35.968 --> 35:37.134
- [Waylon] Hey Jimmy.

35:37.136 --> 35:38.468
- What do you say there, Waylon?

35:40.239 --> 35:43.807
Listen buddy, I was
real sorry to hear

35:43.809 --> 35:45.775
what happened
between you and Nida.

35:45.777 --> 35:47.210
- Appreciate that, bud.

35:47.212 --> 35:48.612
- We'll get it
sorted out though.

35:48.614 --> 35:50.580
- Well if there's anything
you need, you just

35:50.582 --> 35:51.414
let me know.

35:51.416 --> 35:52.716
- I will for sure.

35:52.718 --> 35:54.217
- Okay.

35:54.219 --> 35:56.520
Oh hey, did you get
that test scheduled yet?

35:56.522 --> 35:58.755
- Yeah, I'm going on Tuesday.

35:58.757 --> 35:59.656
- Sounds good.

36:04.863 --> 36:07.497
(bell ringing)

36:09.468 --> 36:11.935
- It's only ever in your
system about three days,

36:11.937 --> 36:12.736
but you drink the
tea the whole day,

36:12.738 --> 36:14.004
and you take the B3.

36:14.006 --> 36:15.772
You're gonna piss all
day long, but at least

36:15.774 --> 36:16.806
you'll be clean.

36:16.808 --> 36:17.941
- [Waylon] All right.

36:19.044 --> 36:20.510
- Why don't you
just get a script?

36:21.880 --> 36:24.281
I know a doc in DC who'll
write you one for two grand.

36:24.283 --> 36:26.383
- I ain't getting
no script, bud.

36:26.385 --> 36:27.551
- It'll make your
headache go away.

36:27.553 --> 36:29.152
- [Waylon] Yeah,
I'll end up dead too.

36:29.154 --> 36:30.787
- Nah, look at me.

36:30.789 --> 36:31.888
- That's what I'm afraid of.

36:31.890 --> 36:33.390
You seen yourself lately.

36:33.392 --> 36:34.758
(laughing)

36:34.760 --> 36:37.027
Listen I really appreciate it.

36:37.029 --> 36:37.928
All right, buddy.

36:46.905 --> 36:48.171
- You missed some.

36:48.173 --> 36:50.574
You can't mow with a weed eater.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.109
- You can mow it
yourself if you want.

36:53.111 --> 36:54.611
- Come on.

36:54.613 --> 36:55.445
- [Waylon] Where're you going?

36:55.447 --> 36:56.646
- Fishin'.

36:56.648 --> 36:57.781
- [Waylon] I ain't
going fishin'.

36:57.783 --> 36:58.615
- Come on.

36:58.617 --> 37:00.617
I can't go by myself.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.852
I might fall in a
river and drown.

37:02.854 --> 37:04.287
- I can mow in peace then.

37:05.657 --> 37:06.556
- Come on.

37:12.397 --> 37:13.797
- My stuff's at the house.

37:16.435 --> 37:18.635
- [Bill] What's that
you're drinkin'?

37:18.637 --> 37:19.502
- It's tea.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.173
- Tea?

37:23.175 --> 37:24.107
- Yeah, it's tea.

37:25.143 --> 37:27.477
(laughing)

37:28.680 --> 37:30.180
- Tea.

37:30.182 --> 37:32.015
(laughing)

37:32.017 --> 37:33.750
Oh you're drinking tea.

37:33.752 --> 37:36.086
(laughing)

37:43.528 --> 37:45.328
- I'll be right back.

37:48.900 --> 37:50.667
- Oh my God, he's in there.

37:50.669 --> 37:51.568
He's in there!

37:51.570 --> 37:52.402
He's in there.

37:52.404 --> 37:53.570
- Whoa.

37:53.572 --> 37:54.237
- I don't know what
happened to him.

37:54.239 --> 37:55.255
- Nida stop.

37:55.256 --> 37:56.272
- I don't know what happened.
- Calm down, calm down.

37:56.275 --> 37:57.073
I'm right here, I'm right here.

37:57.075 --> 37:59.609
What is it? Tell me.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.177
- It's Toby, he's dead.

38:01.179 --> 38:02.045
He's in there.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.079
He's dead.

38:03.081 --> 38:04.481
Take her inside.

38:04.483 --> 38:07.017
(dramatic music)

38:07.019 --> 38:07.917
Go now.

38:08.987 --> 38:11.821
(dramatic music)

39:01.440 --> 39:04.240
(stick snapping)

39:08.213 --> 39:11.114
(dramatic music)

39:25.497 --> 39:27.564
One day without somethin'.

39:28.967 --> 39:31.801
(dramatic music)

40:05.971 --> 40:08.705
(phone ringing)

40:17.149 --> 40:18.047
Hello?

40:31.096 --> 40:33.596
(rock music)

40:39.971 --> 40:41.604
- [Nona] Waylon.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.717
- [Waylon] What are you doing?

40:54.719 --> 40:57.353
- Hey what are you doing here?

40:57.355 --> 40:59.489
- [Waylon] I came to get you.

40:59.491 --> 41:00.323
- I can't leave yet.

41:00.325 --> 41:01.624
I feel amazing.

41:01.626 --> 41:02.859
- She can't leave.

41:02.861 --> 41:04.360
She's hanging with me.

41:04.362 --> 41:06.095
- [Raylene] Waylon.

41:06.097 --> 41:07.397
- She ain't hanging with you.

41:07.399 --> 41:08.698
- [Waylon] It's time
to go home, come on.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.366
- I can't get up.
- Get your stuff.

41:10.368 --> 41:11.201
- Hey where are you going.

41:11.203 --> 41:12.035
- [Raylene] Waylon.

41:12.037 --> 41:12.869
(smacking)

41:12.871 --> 41:14.070
- Oh shit.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.638
- [Waylon] We're
going home, let's go.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.473
- I feel so good.

41:16.475 --> 41:17.340
- [Waylon] Now.

41:18.276 --> 41:19.876
- Don't you be jealous, missy.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.912
- Raylene, go home.

41:22.914 --> 41:23.847
- [Waylon] You're comin' too.

41:23.849 --> 41:25.315
Come on.

41:25.317 --> 41:26.983
- I'm so sorry, Waylon.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.052
- [Waylon] It's not
your fault, darlin'.

41:32.824 --> 41:33.890
- I'm sorry.

41:45.670 --> 41:46.970
- [Waylon] You all right?

41:48.440 --> 41:49.339
- Yeah.

41:52.477 --> 41:53.376
- Yeah?

41:54.246 --> 41:55.478
- [Nona] Yeah.

41:59.384 --> 42:02.619
- Well it was good
seeing you tonight.

42:09.194 --> 42:13.329
Darlin', she's no good for you.

42:25.677 --> 42:28.478
(dramatic music)

43:06.284 --> 43:09.018
(phone ringing)

43:13.058 --> 43:14.157
- [Nurse] Hey Waylon.

43:14.960 --> 43:15.992
- Hey there.

43:15.994 --> 43:17.527
- You here for your drug test?

43:18.663 --> 43:19.963
- Actually would it
be possible to see

43:19.965 --> 43:21.397
a doctor for a minute?

43:21.399 --> 43:22.865
- Sure, come on back.

43:22.867 --> 43:24.033
We'll take care of ya.

43:31.409 --> 43:32.241
(knocking)

43:32.243 --> 43:33.509
- Hey Jim.

43:33.511 --> 43:35.211
- What do you say there, Waylon?

43:35.213 --> 43:36.479
- [Jimmy] I just got
back from the doctor.

43:36.481 --> 43:38.314
I wanted to drop
this off to you.

43:38.316 --> 43:40.083
- Oh I didn't think
they'd have the results

43:40.085 --> 43:41.751
for another few days.

43:41.753 --> 43:44.220
- Well they won't, but
that's for the prescription.

43:45.156 --> 43:46.422
- Prescription?

43:46.424 --> 43:48.825
- Yeah, yeah for the
oxy, so you can send

43:48.827 --> 43:51.194
it along with the
other when it comes it.

43:51.196 --> 43:52.729
- I didn't think you had one.

43:52.731 --> 43:54.030
- Well I didn't, but then I got

43:54.032 --> 43:55.565
to talking with the
doctor, and I told her

43:55.567 --> 43:58.134
how I take one of my dad's
pills every now and then,

43:58.136 --> 43:59.669
you know when my
back would flare up.

43:59.671 --> 44:04.707
She thought that was okay,
so she wrote me a script.

44:07.278 --> 44:09.946
- She gave you any
indication what it might be.

44:09.948 --> 44:13.650
- She likely just said it
was you know just muscle

44:13.652 --> 44:15.218
spasms or somethin'.

44:15.220 --> 44:16.719
She says it wasn't
a chronic pain.

44:16.721 --> 44:19.489
So as long as I'm just
taking 'em as I need to

44:19.491 --> 44:20.590
it'll be okay.

44:23.228 --> 44:26.362
- Okay, glad you
got it sorted out.

44:26.364 --> 44:28.398
Hopefully it helps
with that pain there.

44:28.400 --> 44:30.366
- Yeah, yeah, I think it will.

44:30.368 --> 44:32.335
You know I'm just taking
one every now and then.

44:32.337 --> 44:34.370
You know to get some sleep.

44:34.372 --> 44:36.439
- Okay, I'll just put this
with your file there, bud.

44:36.441 --> 44:38.207
- Oh and hey, she said
to give 'em a call

44:38.209 --> 44:39.375
if you had any questions.

44:39.377 --> 44:40.877
- Oh I think this'll
be just fine.

44:40.879 --> 44:42.845
- [Waylon] All right,
I'll see you, Jim.

44:42.847 --> 44:43.746
- See you Waylon.

44:49.054 --> 44:52.622
(electronic bell ringing)

44:53.591 --> 44:54.490
- Hey.

44:56.728 --> 44:58.695
Look I'm sorry.

44:58.697 --> 45:00.063
Please don't try to
make me feel any worse

45:00.065 --> 45:00.897
than I already do.

45:00.899 --> 45:02.098
It was stupid.

45:02.100 --> 45:03.099
- It was stupid.

45:03.101 --> 45:04.167
- I pissed you off.

45:04.169 --> 45:05.101
I pissed Nona off.

45:05.103 --> 45:06.602
I fucked up, and I get it.

45:06.604 --> 45:09.472
Just I don't need a guilt
trip on top of it, okay?

45:15.513 --> 45:16.879
- Put that in your pocket.

45:17.916 --> 45:19.248
- Where did you get these?

45:21.986 --> 45:23.319
You got a prescription?

45:24.589 --> 45:27.023
- Stay away from those places.

45:27.025 --> 45:28.391
You stay away from Cotton.

45:30.295 --> 45:33.930
You think I didn't
know about that?

45:33.932 --> 45:35.398
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.667
- You think I don't know
what you're doin' for pills?

45:38.937 --> 45:40.002
I know it's not a problem
for you to get 'em

45:40.004 --> 45:41.771
if you don't have any money.

45:41.773 --> 45:43.606
And I know they don't
give 'em away for free.

45:43.608 --> 45:45.174
You're gonna get yourself hurt.

45:45.176 --> 45:47.210
- Don't give me your
self righteous bullshit.

45:47.212 --> 45:49.112
- If you wanna do
drugs, you get 'em,

45:49.114 --> 45:51.080
and you do 'em at the house.

45:51.082 --> 45:52.415
Look at me.

45:52.417 --> 45:54.050
Look at me.

45:54.052 --> 45:55.118
Now I'm not always
gonna be around

45:55.120 --> 45:56.385
to be your babysitter.

45:58.022 --> 45:59.756
- What have you been saying
for the past three days?

45:59.758 --> 46:01.190
Oh I'm not gonna
take another pill,

46:01.192 --> 46:03.526
and then you go to the doctor
and get a prescription.

46:03.528 --> 46:04.761
You're no better.

46:04.763 --> 46:06.863
- Darlin, I don't get
high and lay in bed

46:06.865 --> 46:09.832
with a bunch of using jerk
offs that I don't fuckin' know.

46:10.902 --> 46:12.368
- You think you're
better than everybody

46:12.370 --> 46:14.604
who took a pill once for
fun and now they can't stop?

46:14.606 --> 46:16.405
You think because you lost
a kid it gives you the right

46:16.407 --> 46:18.007
to blow that shit up your nose?

46:18.877 --> 46:21.244
(whistling)

46:22.180 --> 46:23.079
Waylon.

46:24.215 --> 46:25.715
Waylon, stop.
(electronic bell ringing)

46:28.386 --> 46:29.285
Fuck.

46:31.756 --> 46:34.657
(sad piano music)

47:14.232 --> 47:17.266
(crowd murmuring)

47:17.268 --> 47:19.869
(guitar music)

47:22.273 --> 47:25.074
(fire crackling)

47:27.779 --> 47:28.811
Hey.

47:28.813 --> 47:30.046
- What's going on here?

47:31.649 --> 47:33.316
- You said do it at home.

47:33.318 --> 47:34.817
(laughing)

47:34.819 --> 47:37.787
- You got a few pills, and
you got a few friends, huh?

47:37.789 --> 47:39.155
- Come and have a beer.

47:39.157 --> 47:40.189
- I gotta work in the morning.

47:40.191 --> 47:41.290
- Come on you can have one beer.

47:41.292 --> 47:42.325
Let's go.

47:42.327 --> 47:43.226
- Come on.

47:45.663 --> 47:46.696
Come (laughing) on.

47:49.968 --> 47:52.768
(dramatic music)

47:56.708 --> 47:59.342
- What are you all smiling for?

48:04.115 --> 48:05.781
You didn't check this
one out, did you?

48:05.783 --> 48:08.451
(laughing)

48:08.453 --> 48:11.254
(dramatic music)

48:18.129 --> 48:20.863
(fire crackling)

48:26.337 --> 48:28.504
- [Man In crowd] Why not?

48:32.377 --> 48:33.209
- [Woman In Flannel] So
why are you staying here

48:33.211 --> 48:35.544
with Raylene now?

48:35.546 --> 48:36.445
- Who said I was?

48:37.482 --> 48:38.347
- It's what I heard.

48:39.350 --> 48:40.449
- You did, huh?

48:41.719 --> 48:42.652
- Small town.

48:47.025 --> 48:48.891
- Grapevines are good for
growing gapes, darlin',

48:48.893 --> 48:49.959
and that's about it.

48:50.828 --> 48:52.094
- [Woman In Flannel] Is that so?

48:53.197 --> 48:54.096
- Um hmm.

48:57.502 --> 48:58.834
- It's hot, isn't it?

49:00.371 --> 49:01.704
You want another beer?

49:01.706 --> 49:03.472
- I'm gonna head in a minute.

49:05.310 --> 49:06.609
- You want anything else?

49:10.448 --> 49:13.616
- No, I'm good.

49:13.618 --> 49:15.785
Nice to see you though.

49:21.292 --> 49:22.425
I'm going in.

49:22.427 --> 49:23.526
I'll see you, darlin'.

49:23.528 --> 49:25.428
- [Raylene] All right.

49:26.764 --> 49:29.732
(urinating)

49:29.734 --> 49:32.435
(knocking)

49:32.437 --> 49:34.403
I'm still in here.

49:34.405 --> 49:36.505
- Yeah, I know.

49:39.444 --> 49:41.777
(flushing)

49:48.453 --> 49:49.585
You want to, huh?

49:52.190 --> 49:53.089
Come on.

49:54.025 --> 49:55.024
I want you.

49:55.927 --> 49:56.759
- Stop.

49:56.761 --> 49:57.693
- What?

49:57.695 --> 49:58.561
- No, I'm not doing this.

49:58.563 --> 49:59.662
Stop.

49:59.664 --> 50:00.563
- Come on.

50:01.399 --> 50:02.565
No one's gonna know.

50:02.567 --> 50:04.467
I won't say anything.

50:04.469 --> 50:06.369
I know you want to.

50:06.371 --> 50:09.138
- Listen, I know what you want.

50:09.140 --> 50:11.774
All right, stop
embarrassing yourself.

50:11.776 --> 50:14.577
(dramatic music)

50:20.918 --> 50:22.885
- [Raylene] What did you do?

50:22.887 --> 50:25.554
- [Woman In Flannel] What,
your brother's an asshole.

50:25.556 --> 50:27.723
- [Raylene] What the
fuck did you say?

50:27.725 --> 50:29.325
What did you say?

50:29.327 --> 50:30.693
Get the fuck outta here.

50:30.695 --> 50:33.529
(dramatic music)

50:39.737 --> 50:41.470
- [Nida] Hello?

50:41.472 --> 50:44.306
(dramatic music)

50:48.646 --> 50:49.578
- Hey babe.

50:49.580 --> 50:51.380
- Jesus, you scared me.

50:51.382 --> 50:52.782
What's goin' on?

50:54.385 --> 50:57.286
(dramatic music)

50:58.723 --> 50:59.622
- I miss you.

51:05.496 --> 51:08.030
(piano music)

52:00.418 --> 52:01.750
- I can't.

52:01.752 --> 52:02.651
- Why?

52:07.592 --> 52:09.091
Why?

52:09.093 --> 52:10.326
I need you.

52:10.328 --> 52:11.760
Baby, I want you.

52:13.097 --> 52:14.730
- No, you want sex.

52:17.235 --> 52:18.200
Babe, stop.

52:27.378 --> 52:30.479
I don't feel that way
about you anymore.

52:42.093 --> 52:44.426
You can have sex
with someone else.

52:44.428 --> 52:45.327
It's fine.

52:46.130 --> 52:47.096
- I don't want to.

52:48.432 --> 52:49.865
- You're allowed.

52:49.867 --> 52:54.170
- That's fucked up, babe.

52:54.172 --> 52:56.505
- It's what you want
to hear me say, right?

52:56.507 --> 52:58.707
You can have sex with someone.

52:58.709 --> 52:59.542
You're allowed.

52:59.544 --> 53:00.976
I give you permission.

53:08.286 --> 53:10.553
- You want me to have
sex with someone else?

53:13.658 --> 53:15.791
Is that what you wanna do?

53:24.035 --> 53:26.468
You do that there's no
coming back from it.

53:26.470 --> 53:27.970
It's over.

53:27.972 --> 53:28.804
- It is.

53:28.806 --> 53:29.705
It is over.

53:30.541 --> 53:32.107
- Babe, we haven't even tried.

53:35.046 --> 53:36.345
Baby, we're just
trying to survive.

53:36.347 --> 53:37.746
Now we can.

53:37.748 --> 53:40.282
- No, I'm done.

53:40.284 --> 53:41.517
I'm done trying.

53:41.519 --> 53:44.086
- Listen, this is worth
fighting for, damn it.

53:47.358 --> 53:49.725
We didn't get married and
have a baby for nothing.

53:49.727 --> 53:52.228
I'm not going to
walk away from that.

53:52.230 --> 53:54.196
Please, let's just
give this a chance.

53:56.834 --> 53:57.733
- No.

53:58.536 --> 53:59.435
No.

54:00.304 --> 54:02.104
Too much has changed.

54:06.377 --> 54:08.210
Too much has changed.

54:09.647 --> 54:09.912
I love you.

54:13.517 --> 54:16.151
I'll always love you, but this,

54:19.423 --> 54:20.556
this is done.

54:23.594 --> 54:24.493
It's over.

54:26.097 --> 54:28.897
(dramatic music)

55:06.804 --> 55:07.903
(sniffing)

55:07.905 --> 55:10.372
(dramatic music)

55:10.374 --> 55:11.340
- [Mom] Hey Waylon.

55:11.342 --> 55:12.608
- Hey what you doing?

55:12.610 --> 55:14.043
- I was just hurting
a little bit.

55:14.045 --> 55:16.345
- I still have some
coffee in the kitchen.

55:17.481 --> 55:19.348
- Actually just looking
for a few of your pills.

55:19.350 --> 55:20.883
- I don't think
I have many left.

55:20.885 --> 55:23.719
- I just need a couple
to sleep that's all.

55:23.721 --> 55:26.555
(dramatic music)

55:31.729 --> 55:33.095
- [Bill] What about yours?

55:33.998 --> 55:35.230
- Where's yours at?

55:35.232 --> 55:37.433
I wanna see how many
you got in there.

55:37.435 --> 55:38.867
Don't worry, I'll look.

55:38.869 --> 55:40.569
I'm gonna see how many
you have in there.

55:40.571 --> 55:41.737
- Honey, you don't
need those pills.

55:41.739 --> 55:42.571
- I need 'em mama.

55:42.573 --> 55:44.073
My back's in a bad way.

55:44.075 --> 55:46.241
- No, you're in a bad way
because of those bills.

55:46.243 --> 55:47.776
Dad!

55:47.778 --> 55:50.612
(dramatic music)

55:51.515 --> 55:54.183
- Waylon, leave it alone.

55:54.185 --> 55:55.017
- Sweetheart.

55:55.019 --> 55:56.752
- Here we are.

55:56.754 --> 55:58.087
Stop, stop!

55:58.089 --> 56:00.422
(dramatic music)

56:00.424 --> 56:02.791
- You gonna bring her back
when you're done with it?

56:04.028 --> 56:06.829
(dramatic music)

56:24.382 --> 56:26.682
(grunting)

56:28.786 --> 56:31.620
(dramatic music)

57:45.496 --> 57:47.729
(moaning)

57:52.136 --> 57:53.602
- Good morning.

57:53.604 --> 57:54.670
- Hi pretty.

57:55.906 --> 57:56.738
(laughing)

57:56.740 --> 57:57.639
- Hi.

58:01.011 --> 58:02.010
- I gotta pee.

58:05.916 --> 58:07.483
Oh you scared the crap outta me.

58:07.485 --> 58:09.184
What are you doing?

58:09.186 --> 58:10.085
- What?

58:11.121 --> 58:12.020
- Waylon?

58:13.657 --> 58:15.858
Hey you gotta go to work.

58:18.395 --> 58:19.261
Waylon?

58:20.297 --> 58:21.930
Waylon?

58:21.932 --> 58:22.965
Oh my God, what you do, Waylon?

58:22.967 --> 58:23.799
Hey?

58:23.801 --> 58:25.868
Hey, Waylon!

58:25.870 --> 58:26.702
Hey.

58:26.704 --> 58:27.536
Look at me.

58:27.538 --> 58:28.470
- [Nona] Oh my God.

58:28.472 --> 58:29.938
- Oh my God, what you do?

58:29.940 --> 58:30.772
- What happened.

58:30.774 --> 58:31.607
- Hey, hey!

58:31.609 --> 58:32.508
- Raylene what do I?

58:33.444 --> 58:34.276
- Wake up!

58:34.278 --> 58:35.377
- Should I call 911?

58:35.379 --> 58:36.311
Should I call.

58:36.313 --> 58:38.313
I'm gonna call 911, Raylene.

58:38.315 --> 58:39.381
- Wake up.

58:39.383 --> 58:40.215
Oh my god.

58:40.217 --> 58:41.049
- [Nona] Is he okay?

58:41.051 --> 58:42.284
- Fuck.

58:42.286 --> 58:44.319
- [Nona] What's
going on with him?

58:44.321 --> 58:45.153
Is he okay, Raylene?

58:45.155 --> 58:46.388
- Yes, hang up.

58:46.390 --> 58:48.023
What the fuck is this shit?

58:48.025 --> 58:50.292
I told you don't
do that shit alone.

58:50.294 --> 58:52.060
If you wanna do it,
you do it with me.

58:52.062 --> 58:53.328
- Stop, stop.

58:53.330 --> 58:54.463
- Holy shit.

58:55.299 --> 58:56.932
What the fuck is wrong with you?

58:56.934 --> 58:58.100
Holy shit.

58:59.336 --> 59:00.536
Fuck that shit.

59:01.872 --> 59:02.838
- I'm okay.

59:02.840 --> 59:03.972
- What are you doin'?

59:06.443 --> 59:09.344
(Waylon coughing)

59:11.115 --> 59:13.582
Fuck Raylene, that's not okay.

59:13.584 --> 59:14.683
It's not okay.

59:14.685 --> 59:15.517
(crying)

59:15.519 --> 59:16.585
- It's okay.

59:21.792 --> 59:23.525
Hey, it's all right.

59:24.528 --> 59:25.427
It's okay.

59:47.718 --> 59:48.617
- Hey.

59:58.128 --> 59:59.361
Thanks.

59:59.363 --> 1:00:01.897
I've gotta pay it today.

1:00:01.899 --> 1:00:03.098
- Yeah, it's all right.

1:00:06.437 --> 1:00:07.970
Listen we need to
figure something out

1:00:07.972 --> 1:00:12.040
'cause I can't keep
paying the mortgage

1:00:12.042 --> 1:00:17.112
and giving you money too
and living somewhere else.

1:00:17.648 --> 1:00:18.413
- I know.

1:00:19.617 --> 1:00:23.685
I was thinking it might
be best to sell it.

1:00:25.255 --> 1:00:26.822
- You wanna try and rent it?

1:00:26.824 --> 1:00:29.725
- We couldn't get
near enough in rent

1:00:29.727 --> 1:00:30.792
to cover the mortgage.

1:00:30.794 --> 1:00:32.527
You'll still be payin'.

1:00:37.134 --> 1:00:39.167
- I was just thinking
for down the road

1:00:39.169 --> 1:00:40.235
if this worked out.

1:00:45.542 --> 1:00:48.610
- Yeah so, I'll talk to
someone and try and sell it,

1:00:49.413 --> 1:00:52.247
you know if it's okay with you.

1:00:52.249 --> 1:00:53.815
Be better without the headache.

1:00:54.818 --> 1:00:56.485
- Yeah if that's what you want.

1:00:59.923 --> 1:01:00.789
- Okay.

1:01:04.028 --> 1:01:05.927
You'll help get the
place cleaned up?

1:01:07.031 --> 1:01:09.631
Yeah, it looks
pretty bad right now.

1:01:11.035 --> 1:01:12.567
Don't forget to bring the mower

1:01:12.569 --> 1:01:14.836
and the weed eater back.

1:01:14.838 --> 1:01:17.105
- Well they're gone, darlin'.

1:01:17.107 --> 1:01:18.140
- What?

1:01:18.142 --> 1:01:19.207
- Yeah, I pawned 'em.

1:01:25.883 --> 1:01:28.750
- That mower was $5,000.

1:01:28.752 --> 1:01:31.486
My parents gave us that, Waylon.

1:01:39.596 --> 1:01:41.630
I'm sure we can borrow my dads.

1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:43.799
I'll call him.

1:01:43.801 --> 1:01:45.500
He can come meet
us at the house.

1:01:59.783 --> 1:02:03.885
Waylon, you don't look good.

1:02:06.390 --> 1:02:07.255
What can I do?

1:02:08.358 --> 1:02:09.224
- Nothin'.

1:02:12.296 --> 1:02:13.562
- You can't keep this up.

1:02:14.598 --> 1:02:16.665
You need help, babe.

1:02:16.667 --> 1:02:17.532
- I do, huh?

1:02:19.937 --> 1:02:22.838
You tuck tail and run,
and leave me with no home

1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:25.173
and no wife, and you
expect me to believe

1:02:25.175 --> 1:02:27.175
that you're worried
about my wellbeing?

1:02:32.716 --> 1:02:36.084
- We weren't happy,
Waylon, neither one of us.

1:02:37.821 --> 1:02:39.488
- No darlin', you weren't happy.

1:02:42.826 --> 1:02:44.559
Don't lump me into
your feelings.

1:02:45.596 --> 1:02:48.396
(dramatic music)

1:03:05.349 --> 1:03:09.484
I used to hold your hand
at night while you slept

1:03:10.587 --> 1:03:12.521
'cause that was the
only time you'd let me.

1:03:13.857 --> 1:03:16.625
(dramatic music)

1:03:26.837 --> 1:03:28.270
- See you inside.

1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:32.641
(dramatic music)

1:03:36.446 --> 1:03:37.479
- Sign here.

1:03:38.916 --> 1:03:41.750
(dramatic music)

1:03:47.891 --> 1:03:49.791
Here you go, last one.

1:03:49.793 --> 1:03:52.961
(dramatic music)

1:03:52.963 --> 1:03:54.596
After I go to the
courthouse tomorrow

1:03:54.598 --> 1:03:57.098
and get these filed,
it'll only be a week

1:03:57.100 --> 1:04:00.535
or two before you get
your judgment in the mail,

1:04:00.537 --> 1:04:02.604
and we have everything
we need here.

1:04:02.606 --> 1:04:06.641
So there's no reason the
divorce won't be final.

1:04:06.643 --> 1:04:09.444
(dramatic music)

1:04:50.187 --> 1:04:51.419
(electronic bell ringing)

1:04:51.421 --> 1:04:52.320
- Hello?

1:04:54.458 --> 1:04:55.957
We're closed.

1:04:59.162 --> 1:05:00.362
- Hey Ray, ray.

1:05:02.699 --> 1:05:04.299
Where you been?

1:05:04.301 --> 1:05:05.867
I haven't seen you for awhile.

1:05:07.004 --> 1:05:08.603
- We're closed for
the night, Cotton.

1:05:08.605 --> 1:05:09.437
- It's okay.

1:05:09.439 --> 1:05:10.538
I ain't shoppin'.

1:05:12.643 --> 1:05:13.642
- What do you want?

1:05:16.446 --> 1:05:18.580
- Why haven't you come
see me for awhile?

1:05:18.582 --> 1:05:20.448
- Waylon's on his way over.

1:05:20.450 --> 1:05:21.716
- No, he ain't.

1:05:21.718 --> 1:05:23.318
I wanted to tell ya.

1:05:30.193 --> 1:05:31.092
I miss you.

1:05:32.362 --> 1:05:35.230
I was just hoping
that you're not buying

1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:38.466
from nobody else.

1:05:41.204 --> 1:05:42.237
- I gave it up.

1:05:43.507 --> 1:05:46.608
- Ray, Ray, Ray, Ray--

1:05:46.610 --> 1:05:47.976
- I don't need it no more.

1:05:49.746 --> 1:05:52.714
- Yeah well I heard
you get your pills

1:05:52.716 --> 1:05:53.548
from your brother.

1:05:53.550 --> 1:05:54.950
He has a script now.

1:05:55.819 --> 1:05:56.885
Is he selling?

1:05:56.887 --> 1:05:58.219
- This town is small enough.

1:05:58.221 --> 1:05:59.454
You can't take a shit
without someone knowing.

1:05:59.456 --> 1:06:00.689
There are people
selling, but I can

1:06:00.691 --> 1:06:01.923
tell you that he ain't.

1:06:04.394 --> 1:06:07.495
- The question is
whether I believe you.

1:06:07.497 --> 1:06:09.064
- You got no reason not to.

1:06:10.400 --> 1:06:11.566
But I guess that doesn't matter.

1:06:11.568 --> 1:06:13.001
You're gonna believe
what you want.

1:06:16.807 --> 1:06:19.274
I don't need anything
from you anymore, Cotton.

1:06:20.777 --> 1:06:22.277
That's all that matters.

1:06:22.279 --> 1:06:24.446
- Yeah what if I need
something from you?

1:06:28.385 --> 1:06:33.455
¶ Raylene, Raylene, Raylene ¶

1:06:36.493 --> 1:06:39.995
¶ I see you in my dreams ¶

1:06:41.932 --> 1:06:45.100
No, no, no, just 'cause
you're getting your pills

1:06:45.102 --> 1:06:47.836
from your brother don't
mean you're gonna quit.

1:06:52.009 --> 1:06:54.609
Are you sucking his dick
for him like you do mine?

1:06:58.115 --> 1:06:59.581
You sucking somebody else's?

1:07:02.152 --> 1:07:03.651
Now here's the way
it's going to go.

1:07:03.653 --> 1:07:05.387
You got two choices.

1:07:06.757 --> 1:07:08.289
Now you can take this.

1:07:11.962 --> 1:07:14.262
Now you can take it
in an ass beatin'.

1:07:17.534 --> 1:07:18.733
What you want, Raylene?

1:07:18.735 --> 1:07:20.568
Which way you want it?

1:07:22.172 --> 1:07:26.174
¶ Oh Raylene, Raylene, Raylene ¶

1:07:32.282 --> 1:07:35.784
¶ I see you in my dreams ¶

1:07:39.289 --> 1:07:41.456
Oh Raylene, there you go.

1:07:42.325 --> 1:07:44.893
You know I like it right here.

1:07:48.698 --> 1:07:52.033
Oh right there, yeah that's it.

1:07:52.035 --> 1:07:55.270
(dramatic music)

1:07:55.272 --> 1:07:56.171
That's it.

1:07:57.908 --> 1:07:59.808
Yeah, that's it.

1:07:59.810 --> 1:08:00.942
That's it.

1:08:00.944 --> 1:08:02.177
That's it, yeah.

1:08:02.179 --> 1:08:04.913
Yeah, you like it
like that, yeah.

1:08:04.915 --> 1:08:07.715
(dramatic music)

1:08:25.936 --> 1:08:28.002
- You ever gone too
far out in the river

1:08:29.406 --> 1:08:30.839
where the water's too deep?

1:08:32.509 --> 1:08:35.710
The current's so strong
that you can't fight it

1:08:37.948 --> 1:08:39.848
and you feel yourself
breaking free

1:08:39.850 --> 1:08:41.716
from the rocks
underneath your feet?

1:08:43.253 --> 1:08:46.154
(dramatic music)

1:08:46.156 --> 1:08:50.225
And before you know it,
you're being swept away.

1:08:51.628 --> 1:08:54.729
You're no longer in
control, darlin'.

1:08:54.731 --> 1:08:57.565
(dramatic music)

1:09:00.036 --> 1:09:01.836
Right then you
belong to the river,

1:09:04.174 --> 1:09:05.373
and you're gonna drown.

1:09:06.176 --> 1:09:08.977
(dramatic music)

1:09:17.654 --> 1:09:18.786
Don't worry, darlin'.

1:09:21.291 --> 1:09:22.757
I still have my feet.

1:09:35.672 --> 1:09:38.506
(dramatic music)

1:10:40.570 --> 1:10:42.904
(sniffing)

1:10:44.140 --> 1:10:45.673
(dramatic music)

1:10:45.675 --> 1:10:47.976
(coughing)

1:10:48.778 --> 1:10:51.579
(dramatic music)

1:11:09.065 --> 1:11:11.266
(banging)

1:11:15.639 --> 1:11:16.604
- Say Cotton.

1:11:20.277 --> 1:11:24.078
- Waylon, here you now.

1:11:24.080 --> 1:11:26.681
- I just need to get high.

1:11:26.683 --> 1:11:27.515
- Really?

1:11:27.517 --> 1:11:28.416
- Yeah.

1:11:30.820 --> 1:11:31.719
- Sit down.

1:11:35.125 --> 1:11:36.024
Sit down.

1:11:36.026 --> 1:11:36.858
Not there, that's mine.

1:11:36.860 --> 1:11:38.192
Sit down somewhere else.

1:11:43.533 --> 1:11:44.632
Hey bro, you want a beer?

1:11:44.634 --> 1:11:45.800
- No, I'm good.

1:11:48.905 --> 1:11:50.438
- In case you change your mind.

1:11:53.009 --> 1:11:55.343
(groaning)

1:11:59.115 --> 1:12:00.214
What you lookin' for?

1:12:01.551 --> 1:12:02.850
- A couple 80s.

1:12:04.087 --> 1:12:04.919
- I ain't got no 80s.

1:12:04.921 --> 1:12:06.521
Nobody got 80s.

1:12:06.523 --> 1:12:07.922
I got 60s.

1:12:07.924 --> 1:12:09.957
- Yeah, how much you want?

1:12:09.959 --> 1:12:11.092
- $30 a pill.

1:12:11.094 --> 1:12:11.926
- I'll take 'em.

1:12:11.928 --> 1:12:13.027
I'll pay you tomorrow.

1:12:13.029 --> 1:12:14.262
- Get the fuck out.

1:12:14.264 --> 1:12:15.930
- Come on, you know
I'm good for it.

1:12:15.932 --> 1:12:17.565
- You and everybody else.

1:12:17.567 --> 1:12:20.034
- Have I ever not been?

1:12:20.036 --> 1:12:21.002
- No more store credit.

1:12:21.004 --> 1:12:22.537
- I get paid tomorrow.

1:12:22.539 --> 1:12:25.807
- You've got some fuckin'
balls, man, you know that?

1:12:25.809 --> 1:12:27.442
I heard you might be selling.

1:12:27.444 --> 1:12:29.644
You buying else when
you come back in here

1:12:29.646 --> 1:12:33.214
sick needing pills and
ask for store credit.

1:12:33.216 --> 1:12:35.616
- Cotton, come on.

1:12:35.618 --> 1:12:38.086
Come on, I'll give
you 100 tomorrow.

1:12:39.189 --> 1:12:40.221
- [Cotton] You want two 60s?

1:12:40.223 --> 1:12:41.055
- Yeah, that's why I came.

1:12:41.057 --> 1:12:41.923
That's why I'm here.

1:12:41.925 --> 1:12:43.458
- I'll give you two 60s.

1:12:43.460 --> 1:12:44.959
- Yeah, cool brother.

1:12:44.961 --> 1:12:46.260
I'll be here as soon as
I'm done working tomorrow.

1:12:46.262 --> 1:12:47.528
I'll be here.

1:12:47.529 --> 1:12:48.795
- If you suck my
dick, I'll give you

1:12:48.798 --> 1:12:49.931
them two 60s.

1:12:52.402 --> 1:12:55.203
I'm gonna start treating
you like all the other

1:12:55.205 --> 1:12:57.605
crying whores come in here.

1:12:57.607 --> 1:12:59.607
You suck my dick,
I'll give you a pill.

1:13:01.010 --> 1:13:02.510
- I ain't sucking your dick.

1:13:02.512 --> 1:13:03.811
- Really?

1:13:03.813 --> 1:13:06.547
Got your two 60s right here.

1:13:06.549 --> 1:13:09.751
(pills rattling)

1:13:09.753 --> 1:13:10.985
Here they are.

1:13:11.821 --> 1:13:14.689
(dramatic music)

1:13:15.725 --> 1:13:16.591
- Four.

1:13:17.827 --> 1:13:20.294
(laughing)

1:13:20.296 --> 1:13:21.496
- Four?

1:13:21.498 --> 1:13:24.332
(dramatic music)

1:13:30.173 --> 1:13:31.239
- All right.

1:13:33.977 --> 1:13:34.876
Four 60s.

1:13:37.247 --> 1:13:40.448
Ain't nobody gonna be the wiser.

1:13:40.450 --> 1:13:43.284
(dramatic music)

1:13:47.524 --> 1:13:49.023
Come on, brother.

1:13:51.027 --> 1:13:51.926
Come on.

1:13:54.831 --> 1:13:56.297
Pay up right now.

1:13:57.100 --> 1:13:59.901
(dramatic music)

1:14:01.838 --> 1:14:03.304
That's it.

1:14:03.306 --> 1:14:06.107
(dramatic music)

1:14:09.179 --> 1:14:11.078
That's it, come on.

1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:13.915
(dramatic music)

1:14:20.457 --> 1:14:23.090
(smacking)

1:14:23.092 --> 1:14:24.258
- You shoot at me,
you piece of shit?

1:14:25.328 --> 1:14:27.462
(gun firing)

1:14:27.464 --> 1:14:30.431
You stay the fuck
away from Raylene.

1:14:30.433 --> 1:14:33.234
(dramatic music)

1:14:46.616 --> 1:14:49.083
(gun firing)

1:14:51.621 --> 1:14:54.422
(dramatic music)

1:15:00.830 --> 1:15:04.131
(gun clattering)

1:15:04.133 --> 1:15:07.034
(dramatic music)

1:15:14.477 --> 1:15:16.611
Everything is
gonna be all right.

1:15:16.613 --> 1:15:17.545
Cotton can't say a word.

1:15:17.547 --> 1:15:18.846
He ain't gonna say a word.

1:15:20.383 --> 1:15:23.284
(dramatic music)

1:15:23.286 --> 1:15:26.587
If anyone asks you,
you never said a word

1:15:26.589 --> 1:15:28.122
to me about what
happened last night.

1:15:28.124 --> 1:15:29.090
Do you understand?

1:15:30.927 --> 1:15:32.527
Nothing.

1:15:32.529 --> 1:15:35.796
I went over there to get
pills, and he shot at me.

1:15:35.798 --> 1:15:37.698
That's what happened.

1:15:37.700 --> 1:15:40.501
(dramatic music)

1:15:46.042 --> 1:15:47.909
- I've turned on myself.

1:15:52.115 --> 1:15:54.215
When he raped me, I came.

1:15:55.418 --> 1:15:57.552
(crying)

1:16:06.429 --> 1:16:09.263
(dramatic music)

1:16:42.098 --> 1:16:44.999
(whistle blowing)

1:16:45.802 --> 1:16:47.234
- Appreciate it boss.

1:16:48.571 --> 1:16:52.006
- Hey man, I heard he broke
his jaw, bust his cheek,

1:16:52.008 --> 1:16:53.307
burst his eardrum.

1:16:54.210 --> 1:16:55.977
Cotton's gonna kill someone.

1:16:55.979 --> 1:16:57.078
- You know he will.

1:16:57.080 --> 1:16:58.946
- They know who did it too.

1:16:58.948 --> 1:17:00.615
That's what I heard.

1:17:00.617 --> 1:17:03.351
- Yeah, you know who
else knows, Cotton.

1:17:03.353 --> 1:17:04.418
I guarantee he's gonna take care

1:17:04.420 --> 1:17:05.620
of it by himself.

1:17:05.622 --> 1:17:06.821
- He's not pressing
charges on him.

1:17:08.224 --> 1:17:09.457
- Tell you what I sure
as hell wouldn't want

1:17:09.459 --> 1:17:11.192
to be on the biting
end of that snake.

1:17:12.562 --> 1:17:15.596
- Sounds like to me Cotton
oughta watch his ass.

1:17:15.598 --> 1:17:16.998
If somebody wanted
him dead, he'd be

1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:19.567
blowing smoke rings out
the back of his head.

1:17:19.569 --> 1:17:21.502
- Okay Waylon, get on inside.

1:17:22.605 --> 1:17:24.271
- [Mill Worker] Man,
oughta snap your head.

1:17:45.028 --> 1:17:47.261
(sighing)

1:17:54.337 --> 1:17:55.436
- It's okay Jimmy.

1:17:57.707 --> 1:17:59.006
I ain't mad, bud.

1:17:59.008 --> 1:18:00.107
I've been waiting
for it to happen.

1:18:00.109 --> 1:18:01.142
It's all right.

1:18:04.180 --> 1:18:05.746
- Don't come to work tomorrow.

1:18:11.587 --> 1:18:12.486
Waylon.

1:18:16.559 --> 1:18:17.792
- It's my fault, bud.

1:18:17.794 --> 1:18:19.393
I'm sorry for making
you have to do it.

1:18:23.433 --> 1:18:25.299
- I just want you
to take some time.

1:18:27.070 --> 1:18:28.569
- What do you mean take time?

1:18:30.606 --> 1:18:32.640
- I spoke with the bosses,
and everyone's agreed

1:18:32.642 --> 1:18:34.775
that you have had one
heck of a bad year.

1:18:36.312 --> 1:18:37.978
I mean this is enough
to kill everyone

1:18:37.980 --> 1:18:39.346
here including myself.

1:18:42.085 --> 1:18:44.685
They're giving you
full medical benefits,

1:18:44.687 --> 1:18:46.420
and you're still
getting your pay.

1:18:47.857 --> 1:18:51.158
You need help,
brother, so go get it.

1:18:55.798 --> 1:18:57.565
- I don't know what to say.

1:18:58.868 --> 1:18:59.767
- I know.

1:19:03.172 --> 1:19:05.673
Not a day goes by I don't
think about Justine.

1:19:10.113 --> 1:19:13.881
You know I loved her like
she were one of my own.

1:19:17.286 --> 1:19:19.053
I don't know what
I would've done.

1:19:22.658 --> 1:19:23.691
- Thank you, Jimmy.

1:19:26.796 --> 1:19:27.695
- Okay now.

1:19:35.004 --> 1:19:36.771
- Thanks for keeping
up her grave.

1:20:00.797 --> 1:20:03.330
- There's around
500, 600 missing.

1:20:03.332 --> 1:20:04.365
She was skimming.

1:20:05.368 --> 1:20:07.168
- You know for sure it was her?

1:20:07.170 --> 1:20:09.303
- Yeah Mrs. Skool had a
couple of cameras there.

1:20:09.305 --> 1:20:12.606
The books were off a little
bit over a longer period,

1:20:12.608 --> 1:20:14.241
so she put 'em up.

1:20:15.111 --> 1:20:17.144
- Let me ask you something?

1:20:17.146 --> 1:20:19.113
Is there anything
else on those tapes?

1:20:22.251 --> 1:20:25.519
Come on I've known you
my whole life, and?

1:20:26.589 --> 1:20:29.356
- Yeah, it's all there.

1:20:30.827 --> 1:20:32.893
- Can he go away for that?

1:20:32.895 --> 1:20:36.263
- Raylene said it
was consensual.

1:20:39.669 --> 1:20:41.202
- What about bail?

1:20:41.204 --> 1:20:43.437
- Not until she's
been arraigned.

1:20:44.507 --> 1:20:46.941
- All right, thanks Dave.

1:20:50.646 --> 1:20:53.514
- Transport'll be here in
about 10 minutes for Raylene.

1:20:55.051 --> 1:20:56.684
We'll bring her out the side.

1:20:58.921 --> 1:20:59.920
- I appreciate you.

1:21:08.464 --> 1:21:10.664
(beeping)

1:21:11.467 --> 1:21:14.168
(PA chattering)

1:21:17.240 --> 1:21:19.073
- You just can't
touch her, Waylon.

1:21:20.943 --> 1:21:22.009
- What are you doing here?

1:21:22.011 --> 1:21:23.077
- You okay?

1:21:23.079 --> 1:21:24.578
- Yeah.

1:21:24.580 --> 1:21:26.747
- I'll be down to bail you
out as soon as its set.

1:21:26.749 --> 1:21:27.982
- Don't.

1:21:27.984 --> 1:21:29.350
- No, no, I'll get
it figured out.

1:21:29.352 --> 1:21:32.353
- No Waylon, I won't
leave if you do.

1:21:34.156 --> 1:21:35.589
It's better for me in here.

1:21:36.993 --> 1:21:39.560
They said first offense, I
go straight to treatment.

1:21:42.665 --> 1:21:43.998
I can't do this anymore.

1:21:46.202 --> 1:21:49.670
You've lost two girls,
and it'll all go to waste

1:21:49.672 --> 1:21:51.171
if you get lost too.

1:21:52.475 --> 1:21:55.542
- [Dave] Raylene, we gotta go.

1:21:56.779 --> 1:21:57.845
- All right.

1:21:59.382 --> 1:22:00.347
I love you.

1:22:00.349 --> 1:22:01.515
- I love you.

1:22:01.517 --> 1:22:03.417
Be careful, all right.

1:22:04.687 --> 1:22:07.988
(dramatic piano music)

1:23:16.225 --> 1:23:17.358
- What you doin'?

1:23:19.595 --> 1:23:20.995
- Waiting for it to get dark.

1:23:20.997 --> 1:23:21.895
- Yeah.

1:23:26.268 --> 1:23:27.368
We found a place.

1:23:30.206 --> 1:23:33.173
We'll take you there now.

1:23:33.175 --> 1:23:35.976
Take you up to the
hospital, get you something

1:23:35.978 --> 1:23:37.011
to get us there.

1:23:40.282 --> 1:23:41.782
- Dad, I ain't
goin' to no rehab.

1:23:41.784 --> 1:23:42.116
I can't do it.

1:23:45.688 --> 1:23:48.055
- You can't keep doing this.

1:23:52.228 --> 1:23:53.794
I buried a grandbaby.

1:23:54.830 --> 1:23:56.263
I can't bury another.

1:23:57.500 --> 1:23:59.033
You're supposed to bury me.

1:24:01.037 --> 1:24:05.406
But this won't work
unless you want it to.

1:24:13.482 --> 1:24:18.552
I ain't no good at
talking, never have been.

1:24:19.622 --> 1:24:21.722
And I'm payin' that price.

1:24:25.094 --> 1:24:28.762
You're supposed to
learn, be better for it.

1:24:30.933 --> 1:24:32.066
Be better than me.

1:24:39.675 --> 1:24:41.909
Go for a walk along the river.

1:24:45.448 --> 1:24:47.381
You've got a strong mind.

1:24:49.118 --> 1:24:50.284
Get it back.

1:24:51.554 --> 1:24:53.220
Make things right.

1:24:58.661 --> 1:25:01.495
(dramatic music)

1:25:59.421 --> 1:26:02.222
(flushing)

1:26:02.224 --> 1:26:05.058
(dramatic music)

1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:53.340
(grunting)

1:26:54.176 --> 1:26:56.977
(dramatic music)

1:27:01.684 --> 1:27:03.417
- [Nida] Drink this.

1:27:07.189 --> 1:27:08.589
Come on.

1:27:08.591 --> 1:27:11.391
(dramatic music)

1:28:02.645 --> 1:28:05.479
(pleasant music)

1:28:27.303 --> 1:28:28.201
- Hi.

1:28:30.539 --> 1:28:31.805
- You're real.

1:28:36.979 --> 1:28:39.112
- [Nida] How you feelin'?

1:28:42.718 --> 1:28:45.118
- I think I'm gonna make it.

1:28:47.990 --> 1:28:48.922
Thank you, baby.

1:28:54.963 --> 1:28:57.698
- I know it wasn't just all you.

1:29:01.670 --> 1:29:02.736
I messed up.

1:29:08.243 --> 1:29:09.710
- It's all right?

1:29:11.180 --> 1:29:14.314
- I can't work on us until
I work on me, you know?

1:29:16.218 --> 1:29:17.551
I'm gonna need some time.

1:29:21.824 --> 1:29:25.025
I would never ask
you to wait for me,

1:29:25.027 --> 1:29:26.593
but I hope you do.

1:29:32.167 --> 1:29:35.335
- I'm not going
anywhere, darlin'.

1:29:35.337 --> 1:29:38.171
(pleasant music)

1:29:48.250 --> 1:29:51.318
- I'm not gonna
have another family.

1:29:53.689 --> 1:29:55.155
It's only you.

1:29:55.157 --> 1:29:56.790
It's always just you.

1:29:56.792 --> 1:29:58.592
You know that, right?

1:30:00.162 --> 1:30:01.061
- Um hmm.

1:30:07.836 --> 1:30:12.906
- I love you.

1:30:13.709 --> 1:30:15.375
- I love you so much, baby.

1:30:21.216 --> 1:30:24.618
(pleasant guitar music)

1:31:34.056 --> 1:31:36.790
(calming music)

1:33:20.662 --> 1:33:23.296
(guitar music)
