So, you're coming back tomorrow?

21:15.507 --> 21:18.042
You're not worried about
getting your cutie mark?

21:18.077 --> 21:20.678
Nah. I already know
I'm a good flyer.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.746
It kinda runs in the family.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.882
I guess it's time to see
what other stuff I can do.

21:26.452 --> 21:27.451
Hm hm.
