<i>Previously on Strike Back...</i>

00:01.545 --> 00:03.655
Section 20 requires new leadership.

00:03.690 --> 00:05.575
Some of you already
know Captain Dalton.

00:05.580 --> 00:07.850
Michael Stonebridge, you
must miss it, in the field?

00:07.885 --> 00:09.910
Tonight you'll be
employing live rounds.

00:10.490 --> 00:11.940
Get down!

00:12.530 --> 00:15.365
- What happened to your brother...
- His name was Jake. He was a fine soldier.

00:15.366 --> 00:16.988
- What's in the case?
- Nuclear triggers.

00:16.990 --> 00:20.100
Do you have any idea what possession of those
triggers could mean in the wrong hands?

00:20.135 --> 00:22.030
- Can we start again?
- Of course we can.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.135
Kerry!

00:23.140 --> 00:25.190
Craig Hanson as the man
who murdered your wife.

00:25.225 --> 00:27.107
- Conrad Knox.
- That is our new target?

00:27.142 --> 00:28.990
He could certainly
afford those triggers.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.150
With this...
We can raise Africa

00:31.160 --> 00:34.300
to where its voice is not
just heard, but listened to.

00:34.310 --> 00:36.950
There are clear guidelines
about the treatment of prisoners.

00:37.550 --> 00:39.720
- Craig Hanson, Mr. Knox.
- Hire him.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.540
If we deactivate this one
without doing the other one

00:41.575 --> 00:43.520
at exactly the same
time, it'll detonate.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.125
I forgive you.

00:46.130 --> 00:48.480
This isn't about Africa.
This is about you.

00:51.500 --> 00:52.540
Fuck me.

00:52.550 --> 00:53.415
No!

00:53.450 --> 00:54.920
Dalton has been shot.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.975
Section 20 has
a future after all.

00:58.010 --> 01:00.110
It's a good thing
there was two of you.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.920
- Please...
- Shut up!

02:13.000 --> 02:16.565
You are making a mistake. I have told you,
I am a journalist. You are making a mistake.

02:16.960 --> 02:20.360
The woman you were
with... a journalist, too?

02:20.820 --> 02:22.979
I don't know who you mean.

02:25.081 --> 02:27.541
Don't you know what
we do with spies?

02:30.220 --> 02:32.780
You are making a mistake.
I am Associated Press.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.460
Check my credentials!

02:35.740 --> 02:37.220
Where is the woman?

02:38.221 --> 02:40.021
- Go fuck yourself!
- Stop!

02:40.802 --> 02:42.322
Stop!

02:42.980 --> 02:44.280
Kamali.

02:45.281 --> 02:48.281
- Al-Zuhari would not...
- Al-Zuhari and I speak as one.

02:48.286 --> 02:50.282
You should know that.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.483
He"ll tell you nothing.

03:06.084 --> 03:07.984
And we don't have time for this.

03:10.010 --> 03:11.830
You are making a mistake.
I am a journalist.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.700
I know who you are, Sgt. Baxter.

03:17.720 --> 03:19.570
I know everything.

NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, USA

05:32.180 --> 05:34.980
You see, in Britain, we have
a game called Snooker,

05:35.450 --> 05:37.500
which is similar in
many ways; it just, uh,

05:37.590 --> 05:40.360
requires a more skillful
and delicate touch.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.900
It's also played on a larger
table with much smaller pockets,

05:49.110 --> 05:52.020
so this is, um, easy.

06:04.220 --> 06:06.700
- You served?
- No, ma'am. I'm an accountant.

06:07.820 --> 06:12.730
- You boys wear it like a badge.
- I'm on holiday.

06:14.090 --> 06:16.760
- How far are you going?
- Until we run out of road.

06:19.330 --> 06:21.520
May you find peace
at the end of it.

06:22.670 --> 06:24.080
Cheers to that.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.935
Oh, fuck me.
I love American girls.

06:29.320 --> 06:33.150
- Where's that buddy of yours at? - You should
probably ask that pretty waitress of yours.

06:34.020 --> 06:35.490
That's my daughter!

07:21.600 --> 07:24.840
"Let's have some fun," you said.
"Let's get away from it all," you said, yeah. Brilliant.

07:24.855 --> 07:26.810
Michael, you wanted
to go for a fuckin' walk.

07:27.060 --> 07:28.950
Mate, the Camino de
Santiago's not a walk,

07:28.985 --> 07:30.840
it's a spiritual pilgrimage.
I told you that.

07:31.550 --> 07:34.370
Hey, you boys, you know that
California's a helmet state, right?

07:34.405 --> 07:36.800
No, sir, we weren't
aware of that.

07:36.802 --> 07:38.055
- I was.
- Really?

07:38.060 --> 07:42.185
And you got traffic violations in
6 other states from here to Alaska.

07:42.215 --> 07:43.680
Only 6?

07:43.820 --> 07:46.540
- You runnin' from somethin'?
- Uh, we're just on holiday, sir.

07:47.060 --> 07:49.760
- Vacation. - Vacation.
- He means vacation.

07:49.765 --> 07:51.850
License and registration.

07:53.350 --> 07:55.000
Does that belong to you?

08:07.860 --> 08:09.410
Is that Richmond?

08:10.840 --> 08:12.230
Fucking Richmond.

08:13.520 --> 08:16.070
- They're definitely with us.
- See ya, man.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.820
Stand to, Sergeants.
Leave is over.

08:21.920 --> 08:24.020
- What's going on? - What're you
talking about? We just got here!

08:24.110 --> 08:25.645
Come on, Michael.
Back me up on this.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.290
- Look, we're heading south.
We have plans. - Not anymore!

08:28.295 --> 08:30.400
- Why? - What happened?
- Baxter's dead!

08:31.050 --> 08:32.760
- What? How?
- Come on.

08:33.789 --> 08:35.360
- Briefing en route.
- Wait!

08:35.390 --> 08:38.080
Transport waiting
at Twentynine Palms airbase.

08:40.100 --> 08:41.900
I got a situation here.

08:57.290 --> 09:00.300
BEIRUT, LEBANON

09:10.170 --> 09:11.580
Shit.

10:05.470 --> 10:06.881
Out!

10:07.720 --> 10:09.182
Out!

10:10.460 --> 10:12.790
Not you, Sankara,
you sack of shit!

10:16.890 --> 10:18.920
- You betrayed me.
- No! I swear!

10:21.180 --> 10:23.600
They murdered one of my men.

10:25.280 --> 10:28.790
You give me Kamali, or Hezbollah finds out
that you're working for me.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.230
But I'm not...

10:32.100 --> 10:33.770
You better hope they think so.

10:34.570 --> 10:36.550
Colombia! They went to Colombia!

10:37.260 --> 10:41.240
- Colombia's a big fucking place! - Kamali's meeting
the Gomez Cartel and the Russians!

10:41.650 --> 10:43.260
They're about to go to war!

10:45.460 --> 10:47.640
Put some fucking clothes
on. You're disgusting.

11:04.680 --> 11:07.900
- Ready, Sergeant. - What is that
you're gonna put in my ass?

11:07.920 --> 11:09.870
Yellow fever, tetanus, typhoid.

11:10.690 --> 11:14.940
You're going into Colombian jungle, Sergeant.
You're gonna be dodging more than bullets.

11:15.720 --> 11:18.940
Seein' as you asked so
nicely, Doc, here you go, man.

11:19.300 --> 11:20.740
Here we go.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.830
- That wasn't gel.
- Who's your daddy now?

11:28.780 --> 11:31.170
Major Dalton, they're
ready for the briefing now.

11:34.980 --> 11:36.600
Welcome back, Sergeants.

11:38.170 --> 11:41.520
- I presume you've heard
about Baxter. -Yes, ma'am!

11:41.980 --> 11:44.235
We will have time to mark
his death, but as it stands,

11:44.270 --> 11:47.550
we only have a small window of
time to catch the fuck who did it.

11:48.470 --> 11:51.070
Richmond...
Whitehall online yet?

11:51.910 --> 11:53.620
Coming up now, Major.

12:02.420 --> 12:04.150
They're ready for you, sir.

12:08.260 --> 12:09.620
Major.

12:10.820 --> 12:12.585
- Gentlemen. - Shit.
- Good evening, Colonel.

12:12.620 --> 12:14.510
- That's Philip Locke.
- What, you know him?

12:14.670 --> 12:16.170
No. I know of him.

12:16.250 --> 12:18.010
- Never met.
- Headlines only.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.550
While you two were away
on your little soiree,

12:22.230 --> 12:24.400
an operation in Beirut
went badly wrong.

12:25.030 --> 12:27.270
Sgt. Baxter's
killer is this man...

12:28.030 --> 12:31.570
Leo Kamali. He's a British national,
Lebanese heritage.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.760
Kamali is the money man of
the Al-Zuhari terror network

12:34.795 --> 12:36.520
and the brains of the operation.

12:36.930 --> 12:39.685
Thanks to Kamali, Al-Zuhari
and his organization control

12:39.720 --> 12:43.310
the supply of most of the cocaine
and heroin going into Europe.

12:43.470 --> 12:47.070
Dalton and Baxter were
tracking him, and, uh, well...

12:49.080 --> 12:50.690
<i>care to embellish, Major?</i>

12:50.950 --> 12:52.880
Low-level surveillance,
intelligence-gathering.

12:54.680 --> 12:57.740
- We got made somehow.
- Can you turn that off?

12:58.150 --> 13:00.790
We get Kamali, we
get Al-Zuhari himself.

13:00.800 --> 13:04.475
He's the ultimate target of this mission,
and we've never had a chance to get to him before,

13:05.000 --> 13:06.450
until now.

13:06.470 --> 13:09.120
We have no current intelligence
on Al-Zuhari's whereabouts,

13:09.130 --> 13:12.190
but thanks to Major Dalton, we
know Kamali's currently in Bogota,

13:12.280 --> 13:14.100
but our chance to
get him is limited.

13:14.150 --> 13:16.780
<i>Colombia is still its usual
mess of corruption and violence.</i>

13:16.990 --> 13:20.480
<i>Cartels still have politicians and police
on the payroll, so there is no trusting anyone.</i>

13:20.640 --> 13:22.060
Except this woman.

13:23.070 --> 13:25.295
<i>That's Kim Martinez,
a DEA agent</i>

13:25.330 --> 13:28.200
<i>running a small narco unit
in the jungle near an area</i>

13:28.235 --> 13:31.550
<i>controlled by cartel
boss Miguel Gomez.</i>

13:32.080 --> 13:34.180
<i>He's the man Kamali's
gonna meet.</i>

13:35.340 --> 13:39.070
I've worked with Martinez before.
She's good. She's very good.

13:39.950 --> 13:41.650
She'll take you to him.

13:42.320 --> 13:45.440
Richmond'll set up the Mobile
Crib at Bogota Air Force base.

13:46.410 --> 13:48.760
- Questions?
- Yeah. You want him dead or alive?

13:48.795 --> 13:50.600
<i>We want Kamali alive.</i>

13:51.230 --> 13:54.080
<i>With his intel, we could cripple
Al-Zuhari's entire network.</i>

13:54.260 --> 13:55.690
Agreed.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.360
But if capture's
not an option...

13:58.920 --> 14:00.240
kill him.

14:00.260 --> 14:01.715
- Roger that.
- Yes, sir.

14:01.720 --> 14:04.390
The holiday's over, lads.
Good luck.

14:05.420 --> 14:06.440
Oh, and, Major Dalton,

14:07.830 --> 14:11.070
you know I've been looking for an excuse
to get some dust on my boots.

14:13.030 --> 14:16.830
- Don't give me one.
- No, sir.

14:19.470 --> 14:21.860
If they're bringing Locke
into this, it's serious shit.

14:22.220 --> 14:23.770
Yeah? What's his story?

14:23.870 --> 14:26.050
Philip Locke. He's a
Special Forces legend.

14:26.550 --> 14:29.110
When I trained at Hereford, he
was the man we all wanted to be.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.600
He's served in every major
theater for the last 3 decades.

14:32.900 --> 14:36.240
Rumor has it he was one of the men who
went after the IRA on Gibraltar.

14:37.250 --> 14:38.330
Got it.

14:38.340 --> 14:41.420
- Do you think they're ready for this?
- The cartels don't screw around.

14:41.710 --> 14:43.110
How are they looking?

14:45.750 --> 14:47.540
Better than you, ma'am.

14:51.480 --> 14:55.050
- We should be fuckin' slammin' tequilas
in Baja right now. - Don't tell me that, Michael!

14:55.170 --> 14:56.680
Shit.

14:57.620 --> 15:00.010
The plan was always to
come back to Twenty, right?

15:02.930 --> 15:04.310
Mike?

15:06.170 --> 15:07.660
See you on the ground.

15:11.570 --> 15:13.060
See ya round.

15:21.090 --> 15:22.620
Go on. Say something.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.070
Zero, this is Bravo team.

15:34.170 --> 15:36.540
On the ground... finally.

15:39.260 --> 15:41.390
Zero, this is Bravo team.
Do you read me?

15:44.400 --> 15:46.140
- You got anything?
- Nothing.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.560
- Cartel must be jamming the signal.
- Yeah.

15:49.290 --> 15:50.700
Movin' out.

15:55.390 --> 15:59.180
CAQUETÁ, COLUMBIA

16:29.760 --> 16:31.300
Fuck me.

16:31.780 --> 16:33.190
- Mike.
- Yeah?

17:03.200 --> 17:06.191
{\an8}BOGOTA AIR FORCE BASE, COLUMBIA

17:04.981 --> 17:07.080
Corporal.
Are we up yet?

17:07.140 --> 17:08.920
Got comms online in 20 minutes.

17:08.930 --> 17:10.460
- What's the problem?
- Signal issues.

17:10.470 --> 17:11.835
- Get it sorted.
- Yes, ma'am.

17:11.845 --> 17:13.650
I need the Crib operational.

17:13.651 --> 17:16.050
Scott and Stonebridge are
in country and need support.

17:16.079 --> 17:18.280
I want their location
and I want radio contact.

17:20.020 --> 17:22.069
Dropped into some
shit hole like this.

17:23.930 --> 17:26.310
Fuckin' God knows
what diseases around.

17:28.430 --> 17:32.370
Pick some bad-ass hombre,
and for what?

17:34.300 --> 17:36.610
World's just gonna
keep on turnin',

17:37.930 --> 17:40.380
and some asshole's
just gonna replace him.

17:42.720 --> 17:45.260
We're in the bad-ass
hombre-making business, buddy.

17:45.760 --> 17:49.500
- Fuckin' job creators.
- Ours is not to reason why.

17:49.790 --> 17:53.380
Well, maybe it's time we start.
I'm gettin' sick of this shit.

17:53.410 --> 17:55.330
I just want to
fuckin' win, you know?

17:56.290 --> 17:58.530
There's no win. You
know that. We still...

18:01.600 --> 18:03.080
What the fuck was that?

18:05.540 --> 18:07.830
- Probably a candiru.
- What the fuck's that?

18:08.170 --> 18:10.930
The little fish that swims up
your cock and drinks your blood.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.510
You can't get it out.
It's got barbs.

18:14.120 --> 18:17.590
- You fuckin' kiddin' me? - No, mate.
- We get a vaccine for that?

18:17.900 --> 18:20.000
Nothin' to worry about, mate,

18:20.520 --> 18:22.690
'cause it'll never
find your tiny cock.

18:22.720 --> 18:26.805
Fuck you.
I want to get out now.

18:26.810 --> 18:29.020
Bravo, this is Zero.
Radio check, over.

18:31.220 --> 18:33.955
On it. Bravo, this is Zero.
Radio check, over.

18:33.990 --> 18:37.620
<i>Zero, this is Bravo Team.
Difficult radio check, over.</i>

18:37.840 --> 18:40.470
We can track you, but clear
comms are gonna be hard.

18:41.130 --> 18:43.750
You're two clicks south of
the rendezvous with Martinez.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.470
Good bearing.

20:45.670 --> 20:47.400
Who betrayed us?

20:48.570 --> 20:50.210
Who betrayed us?

20:51.370 --> 20:53.050
Who betrayed us?

21:00.610 --> 21:02.190
Get up, you bitch!

21:02.600 --> 21:03.900
A name.

21:04.070 --> 21:06.480
That's all I want from you.
A name.

21:10.381 --> 21:12.181
Give me a name!

21:14.000 --> 21:15.482
Fuck you!

21:35.390 --> 21:37.815
Colonel, what does the name
Sebastian Gray mean to you?

21:37.825 --> 21:39.180
<i>Gray?</i>

21:39.320 --> 21:41.150
Well, he was with MI6.

21:42.390 --> 21:44.650
He worked out of the Beirut
consulate in the eighties,

21:44.651 --> 21:46.900
but when they recalled him,
he vanished.

21:48.250 --> 21:49.710
Up until two years ago,

21:49.880 --> 21:52.090
<i>he was selling intel
to the highest bidder,</i>

21:52.280 --> 21:55.400
but then went to ground when
he pissed off the French.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.380
<i>They sent a team in to get
him. We thought he was dead.</i>

21:58.530 --> 22:01.130
Yeah, well, I have a pretty
strong feeling he isn't. Need to find him.

22:01.140 --> 22:04.480
Well, I'll send you what we can,
but it's past its sell-by date.

22:04.515 --> 22:06.920
And if you do find him,
approach from downwind.

22:09.880 --> 22:12.560
He sees you first, you've lost him.

22:28.450 --> 22:30.280
Get me on the next
flight to Beirut.

22:30.360 --> 22:31.720
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

22:57.021 --> 22:58.521
Hello sir!

23:01.630 --> 23:03.200
How are you?

23:04.030 --> 23:05.670
Are you alone?

23:11.340 --> 23:12.880
Hands up.

23:14.870 --> 23:18.110
- I take it that weapon's not for fishing.
- Protection.

23:18.330 --> 23:20.560
Around here, you never
know when some dumb gringo

23:20.595 --> 23:22.830
will come out of the jungle.

23:23.210 --> 23:25.650
Perhaps I should
introduce my friends, huh?

23:29.210 --> 23:30.590
Gentlemen.

23:35.330 --> 23:36.790
You're late.

23:38.220 --> 23:40.470
- I thought there was two of you.
- There is.

23:47.210 --> 23:51.390
Kim Martinez.
Even lovelier in the flesh.

23:51.770 --> 23:53.970
Don't try that charm shit on me.

23:56.510 --> 23:59.600
- This one talk?
- When I have something to say, yeah.

24:02.750 --> 24:04.936
So you're Colonel
Locke's team, huh?

24:04.940 --> 24:07.190
Well, we better get you
briefed before you go

24:07.225 --> 24:09.440
stumbling into somebody
else in the jungle.

24:09.470 --> 24:12.100
Not everybody's as
warm-hearted as me.

24:14.770 --> 24:17.330
- I like her.
- You would.

24:26.650 --> 24:28.885
Listen, if you boys want Kamali,

24:28.890 --> 24:30.795
you're going to have to
take him from this guy...

24:30.820 --> 24:32.710
Miguel Gomez,

24:32.760 --> 24:35.045
former Colombian police commander.

24:35.055 --> 24:38.000
- He changed sides?
- Money'll do that.

24:38.160 --> 24:41.430
Now, Gomez was a brutal cop,
but he is in a whole 'nother

24:41.440 --> 24:43.510
league now he's
running his own cartel.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.790
He calls himself "The Jaguar."

24:46.160 --> 24:47.775
All this is his.

24:47.810 --> 24:50.240
It's heavily guarded and patrolled,

24:50.640 --> 24:53.520
but Colonel Locke tells me
you guys get the job done,

24:54.370 --> 24:56.170
operating behind the lines.

24:56.205 --> 24:57.530
Yep, that's us.

24:57.590 --> 24:59.060
There's a line?

25:03.760 --> 25:06.290
Kamali's here only
once or twice a year,

25:06.430 --> 25:09.710
and we know he's key to moving the cartel's
money out of the country.

25:09.745 --> 25:11.595
Now Gomez has
called together all

25:11.600 --> 25:14.850
the cartel bosses to meet
with a Russian arms dealer.

25:15.200 --> 25:18.480
My guess... it was
on Kamali's orders.

25:45.620 --> 25:48.445
Gomez's place is
two clicks southeast.

25:48.480 --> 25:51.270
Find a suitable
O.P., wait till dark.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.100
Sounds like a plan.

26:03.810 --> 26:07.725
- Leo.
- Miguel, my friend.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.960
It's good to see you.
It's been too long.

26:10.190 --> 26:13.650
Seems like you only come to see
me now when there are problems.

26:13.690 --> 26:16.070
- Are they all here?
- You're the last.

26:16.310 --> 26:17.700
I have entertainment.

26:17.705 --> 26:20.600
You didn't need to bring
your own puta madre.

26:21.120 --> 26:25.090
Her name is Celine, Miguel,
and she is not for The Jaguar.

26:28.710 --> 26:31.780
- Viktor?
- Yeah, Viktor is here, not Arkady.

26:32.130 --> 26:35.655
- He can make it a problem.
- We have a lot of unhappy people here, Leo.

26:35.656 --> 26:38.903
We expected the organ
grinder, not the monkey.

26:38.905 --> 26:41.949
Sometimes the monkey
is easier to control.

26:41.952 --> 26:45.170
- Viktor, you remember
my friend Leo. - I do.

26:46.010 --> 26:49.185
Do remember me to your father.
He is a great man.

26:49.220 --> 26:51.955
It's a shame he couldn't be here.

26:51.990 --> 26:54.690
I speak for my
father in all things.

27:18.980 --> 27:20.610
Is there a problem, soldier?

27:23.330 --> 27:26.430
Candiru. You know, those little
fish that swim up...

27:26.465 --> 27:29.170
Not here.
It's the Amazon.

27:37.870 --> 27:39.210
Asshole.

27:42.990 --> 27:45.360
I shouldn't be here.

27:49.680 --> 27:51.780
I shouldn't have to be here,

27:53.360 --> 27:56.275
and that I am must surely tell us

27:56.310 --> 27:59.750
that something is
not as it should be.

28:01.110 --> 28:03.380
Our activities

28:03.430 --> 28:06.400
are under more scrutiny
than ever before.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.910
Every agency, every police force
bring their strength against us,

28:11.920 --> 28:14.740
and yet we prevail.

28:15.200 --> 28:19.821
How? Because we are
united in our efforts.

28:20.061 --> 28:22.350
Division will destroy us.

28:23.970 --> 28:27.530
Lack of trust will destroy us,

28:27.565 --> 28:31.090
and I will not tolerate it.

28:31.470 --> 28:35.470
Al-Zuhari will not tolerate it.

28:46.600 --> 28:49.090
Who says crime doesn't pay, huh?

28:50.360 --> 28:52.120
I got 4 on the towers.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.110
I got at least 6 on the ground.

28:54.200 --> 28:58.215
Am I right in believing
that Samuel has paid you

28:58.250 --> 29:02.030
for the arms shipment which you
agreed to deliver a week ago?

29:02.065 --> 29:05.110
You know where your fucking ship is
and you know why it's not here.

29:05.140 --> 29:07.330
Leo, you talk about respect?

29:07.880 --> 29:10.000
Two of my best men killed, huh?!

29:10.035 --> 29:11.500
Is this true?

29:12.160 --> 29:16.080
Samuel says that the russians raped
and murdered one of his whores

29:16.115 --> 29:17.180
and he had them killed in return.

29:17.215 --> 29:21.510
- Martinez. - Hmm? - Want to take out
the guards, cover our exfil?

29:22.070 --> 29:25.000
Why don't I just go in and
grab Kamali for you, too?

29:25.300 --> 29:27.650
A distraction for our
exfil will be great.

29:27.660 --> 29:29.690
- You got it.
- "You got it."

29:30.490 --> 29:33.230
- He gets "You got it"?
- He's polite.

29:33.410 --> 29:35.860
Besides, that British
accent kills me.

29:37.360 --> 29:40.090
There is a way for
us to make a peace,

29:40.770 --> 29:44.690
but it is through
sacrifice that we progress.

29:45.390 --> 29:46.880
Of course, Viktor,

29:47.090 --> 29:50.285
you will deliver the shipment.

29:50.320 --> 29:54.070
I'll ensure Arkady will
hear of your diplomacy,

29:54.370 --> 29:55.990
and he'll be proud of his son.

29:57.090 --> 29:59.535
- Samuel... - Hey, I'm not going
to do a fucking...

29:59.538 --> 30:03.343
You will make redress
for your actions,

30:03.345 --> 30:06.910
and we will all
learn a new respect.

30:17.340 --> 30:19.217
So let's go in soft,
let's grab Kamali,

30:24.210 --> 30:26.085
and let's leave, try
not to start a war here.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.830
Copy that.

30:30.040 --> 30:31.420
Stop it!

31:52.470 --> 31:54.610
Stop. Hold on.

31:57.760 --> 32:01.560
- Damien.
- Rebecca.

32:03.830 --> 32:07.140
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- What do you think I'm doing here?

32:07.175 --> 32:08.780
You said you were out.

32:08.790 --> 32:11.640
You said no more
Mossad, no more killing!

32:11.930 --> 32:13.520
I gave you that out!

32:14.850 --> 32:17.110
Did you really believe
it was gonna be that easy?

32:17.145 --> 32:19.340
- Jesus Christ.
- This is what we do.

32:20.420 --> 32:21.730
And you?

32:23.060 --> 32:24.790
- I'm here for Leo Kamali.
- Ha.

32:25.101 --> 32:26.331
"Ha."

32:26.380 --> 32:28.150
What's that mean?

32:28.620 --> 32:31.030
Gracias, brother, gracias.

32:44.690 --> 32:46.850
- Kamali's mine.
- Bullshit.

32:46.870 --> 32:49.930
Do you have any idea what I had
to do to get close to this guy?

32:49.965 --> 32:53.265
- Yeah, I got a pretty fair idea, Rebecca.
- Do you even know who he is?

32:53.300 --> 32:56.435
- Yeah, of course I do. He's Allah's banker.
- So why do you think I'm here?

32:56.470 --> 32:58.200
What? So Mossad can disappear him?

32:58.235 --> 33:01.070
Fuck that. He killed one of ours.
I'm taking him.

33:04.170 --> 33:06.825
Damien, do not fuck this up.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.990
I am this close to
getting somethi...

33:12.430 --> 33:14.570
- Celine?
- Fuck.

33:17.600 --> 33:18.980
Celine?

33:24.040 --> 33:25.360
Celine?

33:31.210 --> 33:32.930
You locked the door?

33:33.180 --> 33:35.655
I don't like how these
bodyguards look at me.

33:35.660 --> 33:38.160
They make me feel like
one of those cheap hookers.

33:43.260 --> 33:46.470
I don't like these
people any more than you.

33:46.505 --> 33:47.670
It's necessary.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.700
I will make it up to you.

33:51.660 --> 33:53.100
I promise.

33:54.740 --> 33:57.390
Not now. There'll time
later for us.

33:57.395 --> 33:59.410
I love it when you speak Arabic.

34:00.480 --> 34:01.720
No.

34:02.250 --> 34:03.770
Buenas noches.

34:07.470 --> 34:09.600
What is this, a
fuckin' family reunion?

34:09.630 --> 34:11.400
- Pretty harsh.
- Not really.

34:15.230 --> 34:16.679
Want to get dressed?

34:27.760 --> 34:29.989
- You're making a big mistake.
- Shut him up.

34:30.020 --> 34:33.931
- You don't know what you're doing.
- No, he just makes it look that way.

34:33.967 --> 34:35.920
You have to listen
to me. You have...

34:37.429 --> 34:38.889
No, I don't.

34:49.092 --> 34:50.505
What are you doing?

34:50.507 --> 34:53.176
- Oh, shit.
- Move!

34:53.739 --> 34:55.440
No, no, no, no, no.

34:58.518 --> 35:01.444
Calm down.
I'm on your side.

35:22.860 --> 35:24.110
The fuck you wearing?

35:24.520 --> 35:26.870
You think I brought my fatigues?

35:27.060 --> 35:27.925
This the exit.

35:27.960 --> 35:30.630
As long as Locke's little
buddy's done her job.

35:30.900 --> 35:32.540
Delta, need that distraction.

35:33.700 --> 35:35.445
You can't do this. Kamali's mine.

35:35.450 --> 35:38.642
Unless you got a Mossad team out there
disguised as tree frogs,

35:38.677 --> 35:40.180
he's ours. Oh, yeah.

35:40.190 --> 35:42.320
It's always the little things
they don't tell you, huh?

35:42.330 --> 35:44.490
Like she's an Israeli agent?

35:44.510 --> 35:47.550
Delta, come in, Delta. Delta,
how about that distraction?

35:47.920 --> 35:49.600
Delta, come in. Do you copy?

35:50.100 --> 35:51.630
Delta, respond.

35:53.420 --> 35:55.660
Nothing.
Scott, moving.

35:56.440 --> 35:57.760
Oy, come here!

35:57.800 --> 35:59.455
What the fuck?!

35:59.490 --> 36:01.330
- Come here.
- Do you know who the fuck I am?!

36:01.335 --> 36:03.110
I don't care who you
are. Come here, mate.

36:03.145 --> 36:04.430
Don't!

36:08.420 --> 36:09.820
Moving.

36:30.590 --> 36:32.150
Fuck.

36:32.260 --> 36:34.130
Follow me, follow me!
Move!

36:40.650 --> 36:42.450
Just follow me,
just follow me!

36:44.210 --> 36:45.550
Viktor!

36:46.250 --> 36:47.640
Viktor!

36:48.530 --> 36:49.940
Viktor.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.280
You remember whose
side you're on, huh?

37:17.510 --> 37:20.420
All right, you guys got
to start moving! Move!

37:20.780 --> 37:21.855
Go!

37:21.860 --> 37:24.550
- Who the hell is that?
- It's a long story. Move!

37:24.690 --> 37:26.080
Moving.

38:16.170 --> 38:17.900
Excuse me. Excuse me.

38:24.630 --> 38:26.100
Damn it!

38:55.440 --> 38:59.200
The only way you leave here is with a bullet
in your head. Now fucking move.

39:12.300 --> 39:15.820
Don't shoot.
They haven't made us yet.

39:41.010 --> 39:43.400
- Oh, God.
- Come here!

39:44.200 --> 39:45.560
Martinez!

39:47.840 --> 39:49.055
Martinez!

39:49.090 --> 39:50.500
- Move!
- Fuck!

39:50.630 --> 39:52.240
Rebecca! Down there!

39:52.275 --> 39:53.950
- Oh, God.
- Halt!

39:54.200 --> 39:56.795
Martinez!
Come here! Come here!

40:00.750 --> 40:02.320
Come here!

40:04.430 --> 40:05.740
Follow me!

40:16.050 --> 40:18.020
Martinez! Get back here!

40:18.055 --> 40:20.260
- Moving!
- Fuck!

40:20.380 --> 40:22.030
Mikey! 9 o'clock

40:22.180 --> 40:23.910
Fuck! Scott, moving!

40:38.790 --> 40:40.270
Grenade!

40:41.670 --> 40:42.870
Good work.

40:42.900 --> 40:46.170
Bravo One. Do you copy?
This is Brave One. Come in.

40:47.220 --> 40:49.570
Zero, we need an exfil now.

40:52.010 --> 40:53.360
Nothing.

40:53.870 --> 40:55.850
- Fuck.
- We're on our own.

40:59.170 --> 41:01.350
Stay down.

41:09.840 --> 41:12.040
Mike! More coming
on the ridge!

41:13.010 --> 41:14.580
Catch it!

41:20.730 --> 41:23.620
- Fuck! Told you I couldn't cover 'em!
- Move! Move! Move! Down!

41:30.682 --> 41:32.210
- Oh! Michael!
- Yeah?

41:32.790 --> 41:36.080
- You Navy boys like to swim, right?
- Yeah.

41:36.530 --> 41:38.830
You want to go get that boat?

41:41.400 --> 41:44.170
Yeah, let's do it!
What the hell? Why not?

41:44.205 --> 41:46.700
Rebecca! You cover us back there!

41:53.650 --> 41:56.970
- What the hell is he doing?
- Something brave or something stupid.

41:57.500 --> 41:59.650
Can't tell yet.
