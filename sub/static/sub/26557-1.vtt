No this place is fantastic.

01:26.852 --> 01:30.219
Oh, the king cut,

01:30.221 --> 01:32.389
The Mill Creek Inn.

01:32.391 --> 01:35.462

out, I'll drive.

01:37.195 --> 01:37.831
Hello?

Hello?

01:44.769 --> 01:45.471
Margaret, are you out there?

01:46.805 --> 01:48.571
Is there something
wrong with our phones?

02:36.989 --> 02:38.891
Looks like it's my lucky day.

03:11.522 --> 03:12.989
Oh you guys are already up?

03:12.991 --> 03:14.458
Well, yeah good, we
got more to skate soon.

03:14.460 --> 03:15.525
Is that, uh, before

03:15.527 --> 03:18.595
or after our little morning
session with Mrs. J.

03:18.597 --> 03:20.731
Dude, her husband's
been dead for like a year.

03:20.733 --> 03:21.697
Show some respect.

03:21.699 --> 03:23.566
I heard she went lesbian.

03:23.568 --> 03:25.302
#scissoring.

03:25.304 --> 03:27.637
Yeah, total lesbian.

03:27.639 --> 03:31.743
And, what a freaky
way for a dude to die.

03:33.945 --> 03:34.781
Hold my beer.

03:47.026 --> 03:48.491
Help!

03:48.493 --> 03:49.429
Help, Dale.

03:50.361 --> 03:51.560

03:55.401 --> 03:58.435
That whole four hour
bit with the chainsaws?

04:22.461 --> 04:23.392
Morning boys.

04:23.394 --> 04:24.661
Oh good morning Mrs. Johnson.

04:24.663 --> 04:26.762
Good morning Jonsey.

04:26.764 --> 04:27.599
Aw.

04:31.470 --> 04:32.538
Good morning.

04:35.774 --> 04:38.574
What the hell is up
with Mrs. J. and Jonsey?

04:38.576 --> 04:40.077
What, what?

04:40.079 --> 04:42.611
Maybe she's into the 50
Shades of beat my ass shit?

04:42.613 --> 04:43.680
Well
I'll beat your ass

04:43.682 --> 04:44.714
if you keep talking that way.

04:44.716 --> 04:46.817
Dude, it's a real thing.

04:46.819 --> 04:50.120
Like exercise balls but
with whips and shit.

04:50.122 --> 04:52.356
What do you know
about exercise?

04:52.358 --> 04:54.757
You boys forget, I had a
life before I was married.

04:54.759 --> 04:55.692
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:55.694 --> 04:57.026
I used to play for the U.

04:57.028 --> 04:58.795
We were national champs and won.

04:58.797 --> 04:59.930
Impressive.

04:59.932 --> 05:02.666
Now if you boys are hungry,
oh have some cherries.

05:02.668 --> 05:03.699
I got them this morning.

05:03.701 --> 05:04.935
Thanks.

05:04.937 --> 05:07.738
This isn't the only
cherry I'd like to eat.

05:07.740 --> 05:10.873
Jonsey, what's going on
between you and Mrs. J.?

05:10.875 --> 05:13.377
Dude, she's like 10
years older than me, okay.

05:13.379 --> 05:14.847
Dude, more like 15.

05:18.149 --> 05:20.683
What, doesn't
even matter, okay.

05:20.685 --> 05:21.653
I'm with Jenny now.

05:22.654 --> 05:24.154
You know we're probably
gonna get engaged soon.

05:24.156 --> 05:25.956
- Engaged.
- Congratulations!

05:25.958 --> 05:28.524
Wait, what is.

05:28.526 --> 05:29.425
I've got a good place

05:29.427 --> 05:30.426
you could get a ring!

05:30.428 --> 05:31.861
Get out, we're
not engaged yet.

05:31.863 --> 05:33.562
Go sit your crazy
Russian ass down.

05:33.564 --> 05:36.636
Do not buy any of his
cheap knock off Russian shit.

05:37.536 --> 05:38.569
All right, that's it guys.

05:38.571 --> 05:40.704
From now on we just
think about the cup only,

05:40.706 --> 05:42.706
concentrate on the cup.

05:42.708 --> 05:44.408
The D-cup.

05:46.745 --> 05:47.945
The Prairie
Kings and the Ice Cats playing

05:47.947 --> 05:51.817
for the championship and all
hell has broken loose here.

05:52.884 --> 05:54.517
The fans are loving it

05:54.519 --> 05:58.555
and the fall out brawl
has broken loose.

05:58.557 --> 05:59.856
Let's go boys!

05:59.858 --> 06:01.558
Stop it let's go.

06:02.194 --> 06:03.392
Brewski!

06:03.394 --> 06:05.762
Well this has
been stewing all night folks

06:05.764 --> 06:08.130
and it has boiled over.

06:08.132 --> 06:12.803
Both of these teams literally
fighting for the cup.

06:12.805 --> 06:16.706
This is an old fashioned Donny
Hook, ladies and gentlemen.

06:18.610 --> 06:20.844
Well it appears as if two
players are just gonna watch

06:20.846 --> 06:21.781
from afar.

06:23.214 --> 06:25.781
Why that's Vlad Putin and
little Donny Trump watching

06:25.783 --> 06:28.851
almost as if they
orchestrated this whole thing.

06:30.555 --> 06:33.690
Officials trying to restore
some sense of order.

06:37.862 --> 06:39.096
Brian Pyette,
reporting here live,

06:39.098 --> 06:40.096
we're getting reports that the
disturbance actually started

06:40.098 --> 06:43.500
up north near a small
lake near Alexandria.

06:43.502 --> 06:46.773
Hold on the rune stone, zombies?

06:48.940 --> 06:50.606
Well it looks like

06:50.608 --> 06:53.745
Coach BlackJack is delivering
some words of inspiration.

06:56.581 --> 06:58.147
What was it?

06:58.149 --> 07:00.115
Boys I need to
tell you something.

07:00.117 --> 07:05.021
It's something that's,
well, it's personal.

07:05.023 --> 07:08.925
Uh, for as long as I can
remember I've been embarrassed

07:08.927 --> 07:11.063
to use the steam
room in the gym.

07:12.663 --> 07:14.567
You see, I have a problem.

07:16.634 --> 07:18.267
I have a hidden penis.

07:18.269 --> 07:19.902
Aw, son of a bitch.

07:19.904 --> 07:24.875
It's true, but I, uh, I
overcame this little adversity

07:24.877 --> 07:27.844
through working out
and eatin' right

07:27.846 --> 07:29.880
and a heavy dose of testosterone

07:29.882 --> 07:34.454
and a very beautiful and
extremely understanding wife.

07:36.721 --> 07:40.890
My point is, that if I can
overcome this hidden penis thing?

07:40.892 --> 07:44.194
I know you boys can win
this game,

07:44.196 --> 07:47.130
so please get out
there and win, okay!

07:47.132 --> 07:48.697
Thanks Coach!

07:48.699 --> 07:49.765
All right you heard him boys!

07:49.767 --> 07:52.836
If he can find his penis,
we can find the balls,

07:52.838 --> 07:54.904
now let's go win this game!

07:57.175 --> 07:59.276
Clock winding
down in the second period.

07:59.278 --> 08:01.877
Prairie Kings looking
for the equalizer.

08:01.879 --> 08:03.579
Carried across the line.

08:03.581 --> 08:05.014
Here's an opportunity
and the slog

08:05.016 --> 08:07.250
with a one timer kicked out.

08:07.252 --> 08:08.851
And as the puck goes to the
corner, two periods done.

08:08.853 --> 08:10.889
Gotta win this game.

08:11.889 --> 08:14.623
- Oh man, wait, wait dude.
- What?

08:14.625 --> 08:15.858
Now we don't have that beer.

08:15.860 --> 08:16.728
- Shit.
- Shit.

08:20.831 --> 08:22.666
LED, you
look like shit.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.300
You sit this last
period out, okay?

08:26.305 --> 08:27.507
No, Coach.

08:28.706 --> 08:31.711
I'm good, I can get
one more out of it.

08:32.945 --> 08:35.945
Okay, if
you got it in ya.

08:35.947 --> 08:37.147
Tension
filling the air here

08:37.149 --> 08:40.650
in the arena as the Prairie
Kings and the Ice Cats play

08:40.652 --> 08:43.890
for the championship, a one
goal game in the 3rd period.

08:44.956 --> 08:47.025
Here's an opportunity,
shot score!

08:48.125 --> 08:50.629
And we're tied, two, two.

08:51.363 --> 08:52.829
Fuck yes!

08:52.831 --> 08:53.762
This
game now all even,

08:53.764 --> 08:56.098
and perhaps headed for overtime.

09:03.609 --> 09:05.775
And we're underway
with overtime.

09:05.777 --> 09:07.009
Next goal wins.

09:07.011 --> 09:09.045
Will it be the Prairie Kings

09:09.047 --> 09:12.382
or the Ice Cats that will
hoist the cup tonight.

09:18.789 --> 09:21.059
Oh and a huge hit in the corner.

09:23.794 --> 09:24.993
Carrying through
the neutral zone,

09:24.995 --> 09:28.067
across the blue line, Wave
down to Lundquist, he scores!

09:31.269 --> 09:32.669
Kings win!

09:32.671 --> 09:33.936
Kings win!

09:33.938 --> 09:34.938
Kings win!

09:34.940 --> 09:38.041
Hiendrick Lundquist in overtime,

09:38.043 --> 09:40.211
the Prairie Kings
have won the cup.

09:42.346 --> 09:43.882
LED, I know you're sick.

09:45.250 --> 09:47.816
LED, I'm talkin' to
you, I want an answer.

09:55.927 --> 09:58.927
A joyous
moment for the Prairie Kings.

09:58.929 --> 10:02.031
And devastation
for the Ice Cats.

10:04.903 --> 10:06.072
Look we won!

10:07.205 --> 10:09.873
Jenny, hey, hey, we won!

10:09.875 --> 10:10.940
We won!

10:10.942 --> 10:11.775
Hey.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.108
Oh my God.

10:13.110 --> 10:14.944
Hey, hey, we're having
a huge celebration,

10:14.946 --> 10:16.146
want to come sailing
with us later?

10:16.148 --> 10:18.117
Jonsey, I told
you it's girl night.

10:19.150 --> 10:20.349
What?

10:20.351 --> 10:21.984
But, but we won?

10:21.986 --> 10:25.921
We discussed this, my nights
are mine, no exceptions.

10:25.923 --> 10:26.955
But, but, Jenny.

10:26.957 --> 10:27.891
Jenny.

10:27.893 --> 10:29.959
No more talking about
her, she's a bitch.

10:29.961 --> 10:33.798
Man, tonight we found our balls
and we are kings!

10:34.932 --> 10:35.900
- Yes.
- Wahoo!

10:48.145 --> 10:49.881
- Show down!
- Whoa!

10:51.149 --> 10:53.019
I do not need a turn!

10:56.020 --> 10:58.421
Um why you guys are
makin' so much noise.

10:58.423 --> 10:59.825
No reason Swede.

11:00.458 --> 11:01.391
Okay.

11:01.393 --> 11:02.758
Did anybody see my beer?

11:02.760 --> 11:05.060
No Swede, we haven't
seen your beer.

11:05.062 --> 11:06.729
I thought I had it
in the shower with me,

11:06.731 --> 11:08.831
but I don't know where it went.

11:08.833 --> 11:09.967
All right, I'm gonna
go look for it.

11:10.999 --> 11:11.033
Thanks.

11:11.035 --> 11:12.401
Thanks for trying.

11:14.004 --> 11:15.037
Oh fuck.

11:15.039 --> 11:16.107
Wave.

11:17.908 --> 11:22.914
Six cans enter, one can
leaves, six cans enter.

11:26.051 --> 11:30.820
One can
leaves, six cans enter.

11:30.822 --> 11:34.891
One can leaves, six cans enter!

11:34.893 --> 11:36.759
One can leaves!

11:43.033 --> 11:44.870
- Come on man.
- All right.

11:47.038 --> 11:48.872
Party on the buns, let's go!

11:48.874 --> 11:50.142
Party on the buns.

11:53.144 --> 11:54.145
Ah.

11:56.114 --> 11:59.114
Six cans enter, one can leaves.

11:59.116 --> 12:00.783
Yeah honey.

12:00.785 --> 12:02.417
I don't think we'll be
having any more cans today.

12:02.419 --> 12:03.252
Oh.

12:03.254 --> 12:04.521
Hey Jonsey.

12:04.523 --> 12:05.421
Uh, it's beard o'clock,

12:05.423 --> 12:07.223
Okay Gandalf.

12:21.505 --> 12:24.239
All thanks to your
fearless leader!

12:24.241 --> 12:25.910
Come on props man.

12:45.197 --> 12:46.030
Hey.

13:00.544 --> 13:02.478

13:03.447 --> 13:06.181
Hey, nice uni's boys!

13:06.183 --> 13:07.916
They come in men's?

13:09.120 --> 13:12.088
Woo, yeah, they
come in men all right.

13:12.090 --> 13:13.323
Who wants a part of me?

13:27.404 --> 13:28.240
Oh God!

13:55.133 --> 13:56.302
Get in, get in!

13:57.269 --> 13:58.233
What the hell,

13:58.235 --> 13:59.435
What the hell is going on?

13:59.437 --> 14:01.103
I, I, I mean, I mean.

14:01.105 --> 14:03.272
What the hell is going on!

14:03.274 --> 14:05.007
Shut the hell up Wave!

14:05.009 --> 14:05.941
Jonsey!

14:05.943 --> 14:07.643
What the hell is going on?

14:07.645 --> 14:09.244
How do you expect me to know!

14:09.246 --> 14:11.980
All right, everybody
just stop freaking out!

14:11.982 --> 14:12.614
Okay.

14:12.616 --> 14:13.650
Stop it.

14:15.019 --> 14:16.118
Hey, close the
curtains all right,

14:16.120 --> 14:16.953
I don't want anybody to see us.

14:16.955 --> 14:18.655
BJ, barricade the door.

14:18.657 --> 14:20.125
Swede turn on the TV.

14:24.528 --> 14:25.630
It's not in Swedish.

14:26.932 --> 14:28.500
Introducing Ultro-pep,

14:29.634 --> 14:32.167
when you need more
than just fat.

14:32.169 --> 14:36.104
Ultro-pep will keep you
going long after you're dead.

14:39.977 --> 14:41.710
Brian Pyette
reporting here, um,

14:41.712 --> 14:46.015
I never thought I would say
this, but it's, it's zombies.

14:46.017 --> 14:49.185
It, it's freaking zombies,
let's get out of here.

14:50.355 --> 14:51.557
- Zombies.
- Oh, what!

14:53.158 --> 14:54.360
Son of a bitch.

14:56.094 --> 14:57.225
Oh my God, oh
my God, oh my God.

14:59.197 --> 15:01.232
Everybody relax,
just relax, okay.

15:02.533 --> 15:05.167
It's Dean, it's Dean,
remember, he had to take a shit

15:05.169 --> 15:07.136
so he couldn't come,
okay, it's just Dean.

15:07.138 --> 15:09.204
I'll be the bearer
of bad news, okay.

15:09.206 --> 15:11.107
- Yeah.
- I'll go break it to him.

15:11.109 --> 15:12.507
It's gonna be okay.

15:14.511 --> 15:16.247
Hey Dean, Dean, Dean.

15:19.350 --> 15:22.285
That's weird, I don't see him.

15:22.287 --> 15:24.686
You know I think with this
whole zombie apocalypse thing,

15:24.688 --> 15:26.689
and like us dying
might say something...

15:30.394 --> 15:31.429
Oh my God!

15:33.298 --> 15:35.230
That is some kickin' shit!

15:53.083 --> 15:55.251
Well shit, what are
we supposed to go.

15:55.253 --> 15:58.220
I mean, this place is
probably full of zombies now.

15:58.222 --> 15:59.354
I want to go home.

15:59.356 --> 16:00.757
Where the hell are
we supposed to go.

16:00.759 --> 16:02.358
- Calm down, calm down.
- Your mom's place?

16:02.360 --> 16:03.593
Isn't she hosting
a swinger's party?

16:03.595 --> 16:05.228
So what!

16:05.230 --> 16:07.262
Hey leave Swede's mom's crazy
sex life out of this okay?

16:07.264 --> 16:08.531
It's not gonna help anything.

16:08.533 --> 16:09.498
Yeah.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.499
What does it help.

16:10.501 --> 16:12.602
Dude I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

16:12.604 --> 16:14.103
All right, just
let me think right.

16:14.105 --> 16:15.338
- I get mean when I panic.
- It's okay.

16:15.340 --> 16:16.205
Just let me think.

16:16.207 --> 16:18.273
So the zombies are
over there, right.

16:18.275 --> 16:20.376
All right, so that means
we can't go over there.

16:20.378 --> 16:21.643
So let's go that way all right.

16:21.645 --> 16:23.079
Does that sound good everybody?

16:23.081 --> 16:24.280
And go where?

16:24.282 --> 16:26.985
- I don't know, just, what?
- What?

16:28.052 --> 16:29.786
Oh, no time to
think, come on, move!

16:29.788 --> 16:30.786
Oh, oh God.

16:46.770 --> 16:50.373
Okay, okay, we can't just
keep running around all night,

16:50.375 --> 16:53.642
we have to, find someplace
that we can hold out.

16:53.644 --> 16:55.344
Hold out for what!

16:55.346 --> 16:57.847
Some dude in a park would
show up and save our asses.

16:57.849 --> 16:59.482
While you mom would stop...

16:59.484 --> 17:00.416
Wait!

17:00.418 --> 17:01.450
Why do you gotta go to my mom?

17:01.452 --> 17:03.151
I can't be a zombie man,

17:03.153 --> 17:05.755
I don't think I can find any
place on my schedule for that.

17:05.757 --> 17:10.258
Don't worry BJ, I will shoot
your ass, I will cut you,

17:10.260 --> 17:13.128
whatever it takes, is that
cuttin' off the head thing real

17:13.131 --> 17:14.396
or just in the movies.

17:14.397 --> 17:17.499
I, uh, think so, I
mean, I'm like 45% sure.

17:17.501 --> 17:19.469
I saw a guy on YouTube do that.

17:19.471 --> 17:20.670
What?

17:20.672 --> 17:21.871
If anything we'll
just find a gun

17:21.873 --> 17:22.805
and you can just
shoot me in the face

17:22.807 --> 17:23.472
and we'll be done with it.

17:23.473 --> 17:24.275
All right.

17:25.175 --> 17:27.175
BJ, wait a sec.

17:27.178 --> 17:28.276
What about me?

17:28.278 --> 17:30.580
You're just gonna leave
me to turn into a zombie?

17:30.582 --> 17:31.581
You bunny fucker.

17:31.583 --> 17:34.484
No dude, man, I love you dude.

17:34.486 --> 17:36.419
I can't, I won't let you change.

17:36.421 --> 17:38.488
Well how in the
hell are you supposed

17:38.490 --> 17:41.591
to keep me from changing
if I shoot you in the face?

17:41.593 --> 17:43.459
We'll find a second gun
right, and then we can both,

17:43.461 --> 17:46.863
you know, take the gun one in
each mouth at the same time,

17:46.865 --> 17:48.698
and you know,
just Romeo and Juliet,

17:48.700 --> 17:49.532
you know what I'm saying?

17:49.534 --> 17:50.699
No, that is gay.

17:50.701 --> 17:52.735
I'm not sure I'm into that BJ.

17:52.737 --> 17:54.402
I mean, I love you and all, but,

17:54.404 --> 17:56.238
Boys.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.544
It's not gay, we're just shooting
each other in the mouth.

18:01.412 --> 18:02.777
Simultaneously?

18:02.779 --> 18:03.613
Yeah.

18:03.615 --> 18:04.546
With our pants on.

18:04.548 --> 18:05.780
Yes, with our pants on,

18:05.782 --> 18:07.517
wait, why would we
take our pants off?

18:07.519 --> 18:08.450
Boys.

18:08.452 --> 18:09.451
Can you imagine a scenario

18:09.453 --> 18:11.621
in which we would take
out pants off tonight?

18:11.623 --> 18:13.855
You're the one who brought
up Romeo and Juliet man!

18:13.857 --> 18:14.923
I don't know!

18:14.925 --> 18:16.424
Boys!

18:16.426 --> 18:19.428
Stop freaking out, just
take a deep breath.

18:19.430 --> 18:21.264
We just need to find
somewhere we can sit back

18:21.266 --> 18:21.930
and relax, all right.

18:21.932 --> 18:23.266
Just chill.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.534
There was a
college back there.

18:24.536 --> 18:26.302
I saw a sign that
said safe place.

18:26.304 --> 18:28.571
You know, like where we all
went after President Trump won?

18:28.573 --> 18:29.505
The Kool-Aid and...

18:29.507 --> 18:30.907
Not that safe place Swede.

18:30.909 --> 18:32.708
Maybe we should shoot
him in the face first.

18:32.710 --> 18:34.544
Hey, hey, I got it.

18:34.546 --> 18:35.611
We got to the arena.

18:35.613 --> 18:36.546
All right?

18:36.548 --> 18:37.514
Arena, does that sound good?

18:37.516 --> 18:39.614
Man, the arena's like
five miles from here.

18:39.616 --> 18:42.418
We all just came back
from a championship game,

18:42.420 --> 18:44.687
and I'm pretty sure we're
all still fuckin' drunk.

18:45.522 --> 18:46.655
Yeah.

18:46.657 --> 18:47.789
Oh yeah, I got it.

18:47.791 --> 18:48.623
Drive.

18:48.625 --> 18:49.592
I can drive.

18:49.594 --> 18:50.625
Ah!

18:50.627 --> 18:51.459
Yo great.

18:51.461 --> 18:52.594
Hey, anybody got a car?

18:52.596 --> 18:54.963
No, I take the bus.

18:54.965 --> 18:56.431
- I take the bus.
- Yeah, the bus.

18:56.433 --> 18:58.567
- We can take the bus.
- The bus.

18:58.569 --> 18:59.669
- The bus.
- Like in Sweden!

18:59.671 --> 19:00.506
Let's go boys,

19:03.708 --> 19:04.806
Let's go that way.

19:04.808 --> 19:05.975
- Jonsey?
- Yeah I see them.

19:05.977 --> 19:07.677
- All right, nice zombies.
- Oh, this is it.

19:07.679 --> 19:09.411
- Good zombies.
- We're either gonna die

19:09.413 --> 19:10.613
or we're about to be zombies.

19:10.615 --> 19:12.315
Hey look, hey look
at me all right.

19:12.317 --> 19:13.382
We're not gonna die.

19:13.384 --> 19:14.984
Just, don't look at 'em okay.

19:14.986 --> 19:17.253
Yeah, and we'll
figure something out.

19:17.255 --> 19:18.554
I have to tell you something.

19:18.556 --> 19:20.823
This last year
since, Harold died,

19:20.825 --> 19:22.691
it's been really, it's
been really lonely.

19:22.693 --> 19:23.758
Yeah, yeah.

19:23.760 --> 19:24.960
And you've been so nice.

19:24.962 --> 19:26.394
You know, I'm
just tryin' to help.

19:26.396 --> 19:28.296
I know it might
seem inappropriate,

19:28.298 --> 19:31.633
but I think I'm falling for you.

19:31.635 --> 19:33.401
Are you okay, you know what?

19:33.403 --> 19:34.437
We can just do this later,
all right, there's zombies.

19:34.439 --> 19:37.940
No, not, for you Jonsey,
I'm falling for you.

19:42.446 --> 19:43.278
Oh my God.

19:44.715 --> 19:46.449
It can't be him.

19:46.451 --> 19:47.583
BJ, come on!

19:47.585 --> 19:48.617
Come on!

19:51.556 --> 19:52.391
Wait up!

19:53.523 --> 19:55.257
Back here, back
here, be quiet.

19:55.259 --> 19:56.258
We got it only one bus so
we have to make this work.

19:56.260 --> 19:56.926
Okay, okay.

19:56.928 --> 19:58.427
So here's the plan.

19:58.429 --> 19:59.694
We are gonna get out here,

19:59.696 --> 20:00.863
make a beeline for
that bus, right.

20:00.865 --> 20:03.365
We're gonna hop on the bus,
we're gonna take that key,

20:03.367 --> 20:04.699
put it in the ignition right,

20:04.701 --> 20:05.401
and then we're gonna get out

20:05.403 --> 20:06.835
of there like a bat out of hell.

20:06.837 --> 20:07.902
Does that sound
good to you guys?

20:07.904 --> 20:08.738
All right perfect.

20:08.740 --> 20:09.904
Put it in, put it in.

20:09.906 --> 20:10.905
All right, all right.

20:10.907 --> 20:11.974
Let's go boys on
three all right?

20:11.976 --> 20:13.642
One, two, three,

20:13.644 --> 20:14.809
Let's go boys!

20:17.382 --> 20:18.713
Where, where, where's the bus?

20:18.715 --> 20:20.415
Where.

20:20.417 --> 20:24.519
Just shoot me in the face
right now, Wave, get a gun.

20:25.656 --> 20:29.357
Somebody obviously had
the same great idea we did.

20:29.359 --> 20:30.625
We're playin'?

20:30.627 --> 20:31.459
All right, let's this nightmare.

20:31.461 --> 20:32.661
This isn't working.

20:32.663 --> 20:33.529
All right, back
that way, let's go.

20:33.531 --> 20:34.697
Back that
way, back that way.

20:34.699 --> 20:35.730
- All right.
- Come on.

20:35.732 --> 20:37.565
We don't know where.

20:44.875 --> 20:47.610
- It's not far now.
- Mother fuck!

20:47.612 --> 20:49.745
Guys, guys, all
right, all right.

20:49.747 --> 20:50.880
How 'bout this,
can we fast walk?

20:50.882 --> 20:51.913
Can we at least do that?

20:51.915 --> 20:53.382
Huh?

20:53.384 --> 20:56.255
All right, come on,
act like athletes.

20:57.654 --> 20:59.388
Still got a ways to go buddy.

20:59.390 --> 21:00.890
There's a little
girl over there.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.865
She could get killed out here.

21:11.969 --> 21:13.736
Hey kids?

21:13.738 --> 21:15.307
What are you guys doing outside?

21:19.443 --> 21:21.312
Where's your mommy and daddy?

21:24.848 --> 21:27.449
I'm gonna see if they're okay.

21:27.451 --> 21:28.049
Swede!

21:28.051 --> 21:29.451
What are you doing?

21:29.453 --> 21:30.719
Don't get close to 'em.

21:30.721 --> 21:31.554
Jonsey, they're
just scared kids.

21:31.556 --> 21:33.622
Have you ever
seen The Shining?

21:33.624 --> 21:34.657
The Omen?

21:34.659 --> 21:35.591
The Exorcist?

21:35.593 --> 21:36.592
Pet Cemetery?

21:36.594 --> 21:37.593
Toy Story?

21:37.595 --> 21:38.561
Stranger Things?

21:38.563 --> 21:41.796
Home Alone from Joe
Pesci's point of view?

21:41.798 --> 21:43.065
Okay Wave.

21:43.067 --> 21:45.367
You guys they're just
scared little kids!

21:47.038 --> 21:47.838
I told you!

21:48.905 --> 21:50.706
Red Rum mutha fucka'.

21:50.708 --> 21:51.740
Red Rum!

21:54.811 --> 21:56.746
Wait, wait, wait guys, guys.

21:56.748 --> 21:58.748
We gotta go back
for Swede, right.

21:58.750 --> 21:59.648
We, we, just can't
leave him like that.

22:02.653 --> 22:03.719
- I think,
- You think what!

22:03.721 --> 22:05.453
I think he's gone, he's gone.

22:05.455 --> 22:07.823
I just like a them anyway.

22:08.759 --> 22:11.026
I love talkin' to Swede.

22:11.028 --> 22:12.026
His mom.

22:14.832 --> 22:16.699
She would do anything for us.

22:16.701 --> 22:19.535
I mean she would bend over
backwards for the entire team.

22:21.939 --> 22:23.538
What was her name again?

22:23.540 --> 22:24.840
Elsa.

22:27.912 --> 22:29.577
After each game
she'd come right out

22:29.579 --> 22:32.515
on the ice it didn't matter.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.449
The cold didn't
bother her anyway.

22:38.588 --> 22:39.788
Guys!

22:39.790 --> 22:40.623
Guys!

22:46.463 --> 22:47.863
Did we lose those
little monsters yet?

22:47.865 --> 22:49.864
I haven't seen them in
like six or seven blocks

22:49.866 --> 22:50.865
but those little shits are fast.

22:50.867 --> 22:53.835
Hey guys, they're just
kids, we can take them.

22:53.837 --> 22:55.571
We can take them.

22:55.573 --> 22:58.540
Mrs. J. you saw those
fuckers eat Swede whole.

22:58.542 --> 22:59.141
Oh Swede.

22:59.143 --> 23:00.609
They're not kids.

23:00.611 --> 23:02.812
They're more like
midget cannibals.

23:06.717 --> 23:08.817
Cannibal, cannibal!

23:08.819 --> 23:09.855
Oh God.

23:13.156 --> 23:14.657
Oh do something!

23:14.659 --> 23:17.462
- No, no, no.
- Don't let him bite you!

23:28.506 --> 23:30.573
I can't believe you just
seismic tossed a three year.

23:30.575 --> 23:31.509
He's super dead.

23:32.609 --> 23:33.444
Super dead.

23:34.244 --> 23:35.780
Nice save though.

23:55.232 --> 23:56.967
What do we do now?

23:57.999 --> 23:57.833
Help me.

23:57.835 --> 23:59.834
Somebody help me!

23:59.836 --> 24:02.938
Jonsey, Jonsey, remember,
there's midget cannibals.

24:02.940 --> 24:05.744
Hey, Jenny, Jenny.

24:07.644 --> 24:08.878
What are you doing
all the way over here?

24:08.880 --> 24:10.778
Okay, so I was at
girl's night, right.

24:10.780 --> 24:12.648
And we decided to do crochet
at Elizabeth's house.

24:12.650 --> 24:13.882
Yeah.

24:13.884 --> 24:14.851
So we drove all
the way over there.

24:14.853 --> 24:15.751
But she didn't have
enough yarn so we had

24:15.753 --> 24:17.786
to go to the craft
store to get some more,

24:17.788 --> 24:18.856
but of course they didn't
have the color we were,

24:20.924 --> 24:22.924
Why is everyone
looking at me funny?

24:22.926 --> 24:23.859
No reason.

24:23.861 --> 24:24.927
All right, all right, fine,

24:24.929 --> 24:25.795
but what are you doing out here,

24:25.797 --> 24:27.563
running in the
middle of the street.

24:27.565 --> 24:29.664
Oh, Elizabeth's
brother was chasing me.

24:29.666 --> 24:31.734
There's something
wrong with him.

24:41.077 --> 24:41.711
Wait.

24:45.316 --> 24:47.749
You're running from this guy?

24:47.751 --> 24:48.918
For how long?

24:48.920 --> 24:49.855
About 3 miles or so.

24:51.255 --> 24:54.559
And you never though
to, to just, I don't know.

24:56.928 --> 24:58.960
Kick out his crutches?

24:58.962 --> 24:59.763
Like this?

25:03.101 --> 25:06.768
Okay, not all of us can
be geniuses like you Wave.

25:06.770 --> 25:07.838
Say cheese, cheese.

25:09.574 --> 25:10.208
Ah, yes.

25:11.308 --> 25:13.609
I'm so glad I found you.

25:13.611 --> 25:14.943
I missed you so much.

25:16.814 --> 25:17.716
I love you Jonsey.

25:18.749 --> 25:22.785
Yeah, me to Jenny.

25:22.787 --> 25:23.952
So where are you guys going?

25:23.954 --> 25:25.286
Oh, we're going to the arena.

25:25.288 --> 25:26.988
That's a terrible idea.

25:30.994 --> 25:32.061
We should go to
my Daddy's house.

25:32.063 --> 25:33.696
He can help us, he has a gun.

25:33.698 --> 25:36.030
I don't think a .22
revolver is gonna save us all.

25:36.032 --> 25:37.900
Yeah, I really think
Wave's right on this one.

25:40.938 --> 25:43.771
Safest place for us
right now is the arena.

25:43.773 --> 25:44.974
No, Jonsey.

25:44.976 --> 25:47.241
Daddy can help us, take
me there right now.

25:53.284 --> 25:54.216
What?

25:54.218 --> 25:56.151
Am I the only one who saw that?

25:56.153 --> 25:58.789
- Son of a bitch!
- Let's go.

26:19.876 --> 26:20.808
All right, now
everyone who's a piece

26:20.810 --> 26:22.311
of shit turn around right now.

26:22.313 --> 26:24.078
What the shit.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.981
What are you, are
you like shitty robots?

26:28.853 --> 26:30.719
They look like
homeless bounty hunters.

26:30.721 --> 26:31.319
Hey.

26:31.321 --> 26:33.221
We hunted you didn't we?

26:33.223 --> 26:35.757
Oh, I mean, we
decided to come here,

26:35.759 --> 26:37.892
this is Jenny's house,
uh that's Jenny.

26:37.894 --> 26:39.294
She lives here with her
dad, he's got a gun.

26:39.296 --> 26:40.796
Shut up, none of that matters.

26:40.798 --> 26:43.097
All that matters is
that you're here now.

26:43.099 --> 26:45.834
And we gotta stick together
while the world burns.

26:45.836 --> 26:48.103
You know, watch
each others backs.

26:48.105 --> 26:49.671
I don't know about this.

26:49.673 --> 26:52.740
No, it's okay lady,
I'll, we're Rob and Don.

26:52.742 --> 26:54.977
You know, you can trust us.

26:54.979 --> 26:57.412
I took karate for two years.

26:57.414 --> 26:58.713
At the mall.

26:58.715 --> 26:59.948
Wait, what mall.

26:59.950 --> 27:01.083
The outlet mall.

27:01.085 --> 27:03.151
It was the outlet mall
by my mom's house actually.

27:03.153 --> 27:06.020
Hey, you two
actually want to help?

27:06.022 --> 27:07.055
Hey, look at me.

27:07.057 --> 27:08.090
You two want to help?

27:08.092 --> 27:09.357
All right, tell you what.

27:09.359 --> 27:11.392
How 'bout you two sit out here
and look for zombies, got it?

27:11.394 --> 27:12.995
- Yeah, yeah.
- Good.

27:12.997 --> 27:15.064
Whatever you say man.

27:15.066 --> 27:17.199
All right, we
are goin' inside.

27:17.201 --> 27:20.268
You two stay here,
keep an eye out

27:20.270 --> 27:22.738
and if you hear anything,
report back to me.

27:22.740 --> 27:23.471
Good?

27:23.473 --> 27:25.007
Good?

27:25.009 --> 27:26.044
All right, let's go.

27:35.318 --> 27:36.820
Daddy, I'm home.

27:39.390 --> 27:41.190
I don't think he's here Jenny.

27:41.192 --> 27:42.190
He said he would be here.

27:42.192 --> 27:43.424
He never lies to me.

27:43.426 --> 27:44.261
Okay.

27:48.164 --> 27:49.064
You did not ask.

27:49.066 --> 27:50.769
Put that back right now.

27:53.770 --> 27:55.837
Guys, just put it back okay?

27:55.839 --> 27:58.306
Jones, it's pepperoni,
you know it's my favorite.

27:58.308 --> 28:00.074
Now.

28:00.076 --> 28:01.278
Just do as she says, okay?

28:13.124 --> 28:14.890
So now what Jenny?

28:14.892 --> 28:16.124
We wait.

28:16.126 --> 28:17.127
We wait?

28:18.362 --> 28:20.031
Well I got news for you.

28:21.164 --> 28:24.365
We don't have time
to wait for your Dad

28:24.367 --> 28:28.103
to get back from his
colonoscopy Jenny.

28:28.105 --> 28:30.805
We are like zombie bait.

28:30.807 --> 28:32.141
They're gonna
break down the door

28:32.143 --> 28:34.209
and eat us out of the house.

28:34.211 --> 28:37.411
Now I don't wanna get
eaten out by zombies Jenny,

28:37.413 --> 28:39.213
but you ain't giving
me any choice.

28:39.215 --> 28:40.783
'Cause you want to stay here.

28:40.785 --> 28:42.754
Well I got news for you.

28:44.020 --> 28:45.190
We're sitting ducks.

28:46.089 --> 28:47.088
- Exactly.
- What, what?

28:47.090 --> 28:49.123
- Whoa.
- Hey guys.

28:49.125 --> 28:51.096
What are you goin'
especially you, what?

28:53.830 --> 28:55.096
Oh, okay, all right.

28:55.098 --> 28:57.865
Listen, it's the end of the
world and you guys are idiots.

28:57.867 --> 28:59.468
You don't deserve
to continue on.

28:59.470 --> 29:02.270
Okay, only the intelligent
and strong get to go on

29:02.272 --> 29:04.405
and form a new race
of superhumans.

29:04.407 --> 29:06.909
The Rob and Don-ians.

29:06.911 --> 29:09.244
Intelligent and beautifuL
and perfect in every way.

29:09.246 --> 29:11.279
Don't point the gun at
yourself Rob, point it,

29:11.281 --> 29:12.346
point it at them, not me.

29:12.348 --> 29:13.582
Point it at them.

29:13.584 --> 29:15.116
All right, so we're
gonna take your clothes.

29:15.118 --> 29:16.852
Take your clothes, we're
gonna take your clothes

29:16.854 --> 29:19.587
and then we're gonna make
you all shiny and chrome.

29:19.589 --> 29:21.155
- Right Don.
- Wait, what?

29:21.157 --> 29:22.391
We're gonna take your clothes

29:22.393 --> 29:24.058
and we're gonna spray
paint you in chrome.

29:24.060 --> 29:25.160
Yeah sure.

29:25.162 --> 29:26.228
Chrome!

29:26.230 --> 29:27.328
- Hey Rob, Rob.
- What?

29:27.330 --> 29:28.530
I don't know about the
whole chrome thing, okay.

29:28.532 --> 29:31.199
I don't think any, I don't
think it's very intimidating.

29:31.201 --> 29:32.234
I like chrome.

29:32.236 --> 29:33.067
You like chrome.

29:33.069 --> 29:34.536
We're Rob and Don,
we like chrome.

29:34.538 --> 29:35.938
That's what we do, we
take people's clothes

29:35.940 --> 29:37.171
and then we spray
paint them in chrome.

29:37.173 --> 29:38.373
I know I told
you I liked chrome,

29:38.375 --> 29:39.307
but maybe I was
just sayin' that to,

29:39.309 --> 29:41.910
you know, get you to like me.

29:41.912 --> 29:43.344
If I'm honest, I never
really liked the chrome.

29:43.346 --> 29:46.113
I was more in for the
stuff and the things

29:46.115 --> 29:47.015
and the clothes and.

29:47.017 --> 29:48.584
Shiny and chrome,
shiny and chrome.

29:48.586 --> 29:49.852
Okay, give us you
clothes, take 'em off now.

29:49.854 --> 29:51.219
Fine.

29:51.221 --> 29:53.421
Just take it off, okay guys.

29:53.423 --> 29:55.023
Oh my God, fuckin' perverts.

29:55.025 --> 29:56.127
- Yeah.
- Fuck.

30:01.265 --> 30:02.131
Can go a little faster.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.232
Wash us with cold
water too, okay.

30:04.234 --> 30:05.803
Witness me.

30:12.076 --> 30:13.141
All right.

30:13.143 --> 30:14.977
No butt stuff.

30:14.979 --> 30:16.280
What is this, a size nine 1/2?

30:19.282 --> 30:21.048
Oh, and stay down there.

30:21.050 --> 30:23.384
Down there in the basement
where you'll stay forever.

30:23.386 --> 30:25.254
Rob and Don got
you in the basement.

30:25.256 --> 30:27.221
- In the basement.
- Basement, yeah, yeah.

30:27.223 --> 30:30.324
And by the way,
we found your dad.

30:30.326 --> 30:31.559
Found your dad.

30:31.561 --> 30:33.161
Yeah, yeah, he's
in the basement.

30:33.163 --> 30:34.528
Basement.

30:34.530 --> 30:35.963
- Daddy?
- Jenny.

30:35.965 --> 30:37.266
Oh and one more thing.

30:37.268 --> 30:38.267
- One more thing.
- One more thing.

30:38.269 --> 30:41.536
- Drop it on them Rob.
- Drop it on them Rob.

30:41.538 --> 30:43.905
Revelation, drop
it on them Rob.

30:43.907 --> 30:45.306
Do it.

30:45.308 --> 30:46.540
He's a zombie.

30:54.018 --> 30:54.619
Rob, Rob.

30:56.287 --> 30:57.451
All right, first of all
will someone get Jenny?

30:57.453 --> 30:58.856
Her dad's a zombie.

31:01.191 --> 31:02.227
Let me get this.

31:08.699 --> 31:13.904
Okay, those little fuckers
took our clothes and our food.

31:15.338 --> 31:17.575
And they locked us in the
basement with a zombie.

31:18.942 --> 31:20.542
Wave, I'm about sick
of this shit man.

31:20.544 --> 31:22.647
Well what are you
gonna do about it huh?

31:24.080 --> 31:25.616
You know, I'm
gonna do somethin'.

31:26.650 --> 31:28.316
Yeah.

31:28.318 --> 31:29.653
I'm gonna do somethin'.

31:30.988 --> 31:31.623
Yeah.

31:35.459 --> 31:36.928
Well ladies.

31:38.328 --> 31:39.329
Looks like it's just us.

31:41.397 --> 31:44.334
We should probably
huddle, for warmth.

31:45.368 --> 31:48.402
I don't think we
need to do that.

31:48.404 --> 31:50.037
I'm, I'm, I'm okay.

31:50.039 --> 31:51.506
I'm warm.

31:51.508 --> 31:53.342
Okay, great.

31:53.344 --> 31:54.508
Are you hungry?

31:54.510 --> 31:55.312
No.

31:56.413 --> 31:58.313
No, no, let's just go.

31:58.315 --> 31:59.284
Yeah, let's go.

32:02.586 --> 32:03.488
Suit yourself.

32:18.067 --> 32:19.170
Daddy where are you?

32:22.205 --> 32:23.106
Daddy it's me.

32:28.412 --> 32:29.447
Daddy?

32:32.449 --> 32:34.317
Look, I know those
kids were lying.

32:38.188 --> 32:39.023
Daddy?

32:48.132 --> 32:48.733
Daddy?

32:51.335 --> 32:52.299
Jenny, Jenny hey, hey!

32:52.301 --> 32:53.567

32:53.569 --> 32:55.069
Are you okay, it's me,
it's me, it's Jonsey.

32:55.071 --> 32:56.270
I know, you scared
the crap out of me.

32:56.272 --> 32:57.338
I'm just lookin' out for you.

32:57.340 --> 32:58.373
Are you okay?

32:58.375 --> 32:59.173
Yes I'm fine.

32:59.175 --> 33:00.275
Don't do that to me.

33:00.277 --> 33:02.212
I was just gonna, but,
all right, let's go, yeah.

33:03.413 --> 33:04.449
You're welcome.

33:09.153 --> 33:12.453
No really, if you huddle
for warmth, we stay warm.

33:12.455 --> 33:14.221
There is a blanket right here.

33:14.223 --> 33:16.624
But like, we can, we
can like stick together.

33:16.626 --> 33:19.361
- Hey, where's BJ?
- Where's BJ?

33:19.363 --> 33:20.828
I just asked
you the same thing.

33:20.830 --> 33:22.264
Well I don't know.

33:22.266 --> 33:23.532
He said somethin'
about somethin'

33:23.534 --> 33:27.369
and then he stomped his pasty
hard shaped ass into the dark.

33:27.371 --> 33:28.569
We have to find him.

33:28.571 --> 33:30.639
Oh hey, hey BJ.

33:30.641 --> 33:32.106
Get your ass over here.

33:32.108 --> 33:33.208
Will you get the
fuck over here BJ?

33:33.210 --> 33:35.278
Who's gonna shoot me in
the face if you're dead?

33:37.280 --> 33:38.080
That's not BJ.

33:38.082 --> 33:39.280
Hide me.

33:39.282 --> 33:40.414
- Hey, get back.
- Hide me, hide me.

33:40.416 --> 33:42.249
- Get back, get back.
- No, no, no.

33:42.251 --> 33:43.485
Let's go, let's
get out of here.

33:45.788 --> 33:46.624
Hey.

33:52.628 --> 33:53.562
- In the closet.
- In the closet?

33:53.564 --> 33:55.363
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

33:55.365 --> 33:56.398
No one will find us in here.

33:56.400 --> 33:57.333
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

33:57.335 --> 33:58.400
Zombies are dumb,
they won't open door.

33:58.402 --> 33:59.366
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

33:59.368 --> 34:00.535
Oh, that's fine.

34:00.537 --> 34:01.769
How you doin'?

34:01.771 --> 34:03.206
Uh, I'm good.

34:03.874 --> 34:05.474
I've had better days.

34:05.476 --> 34:08.543
But, you know, the
apocalypse has its perks.

34:08.545 --> 34:09.811
I guess.

34:09.813 --> 34:10.811
Um so you like stuff?

34:10.813 --> 34:11.847
Hey, hey, back up buddy.

34:11.849 --> 34:13.648
Back up buddy, get out of here.

34:13.650 --> 34:14.782
Get out here.

34:16.219 --> 34:17.818
I'm telling you, we need
to huddle for warmth.

34:17.820 --> 34:19.454
- No.
- Hey, hey.

34:19.456 --> 34:20.387
Okay guys, guys.

34:20.389 --> 34:21.590
How do we get out of here?

34:21.592 --> 34:22.523
I don't know.

34:22.525 --> 34:24.592
- Zombie!
- Behind you!

34:24.594 --> 34:26.460
- Strangle him Jonsey!
- I'm trying!

34:26.463 --> 34:28.896
- Try harder.
- You could help me.

34:28.898 --> 34:31.565
- I am helping!
- Just shoot it!

34:31.568 --> 34:32.570
Ah, save me!

34:40.177 --> 34:40.844
Great shot BJ!

34:42.210 --> 34:43.478
Hey, I thought you
were a defense man.

34:43.480 --> 34:46.414
Eh, I got sick and
tired of playing defense.

34:46.416 --> 34:48.418
Somebody hold me.

34:50.420 --> 34:53.521
- Nice shot brother.
- BJ, BJ, oh.

34:53.523 --> 34:55.222
It's good to see you.

34:55.224 --> 34:56.193
Jenny, honey.

34:57.327 --> 34:58.492
Look at me.

34:58.494 --> 35:00.929
I know this is difficult.

35:00.931 --> 35:02.863
Look it's time we changed.

35:02.865 --> 35:04.298
The world's changed now,

35:04.300 --> 35:05.900
we gotta change you
know what I'm saying?

35:05.902 --> 35:07.735
We have to keep moving.

35:07.737 --> 35:09.637
Now it's time to fight.

35:18.614 --> 35:19.449
Um.

35:20.751 --> 35:24.452
I don't know what
that was about.

35:24.454 --> 35:26.387
I want to be with you.

35:26.389 --> 35:27.623
Jenny.

35:27.625 --> 35:32.730
Um, I know your emotions are
all over the place right now.

35:33.597 --> 35:34.829
But this is not the time.

35:34.831 --> 35:36.530
And besides sweetie.

35:36.532 --> 35:37.567
I'm straight.

35:38.568 --> 35:40.304
You don't care about me.

35:41.438 --> 35:43.604
And I know you're trying
to steal my man too.

35:43.606 --> 35:44.472
Wait.

35:44.474 --> 35:45.874
I've seen how
you are around him.

35:45.876 --> 35:47.441
And it's sick.

35:47.443 --> 35:48.842
You old women disgust me.

35:48.844 --> 35:50.447
Jenny, stop.

35:51.481 --> 35:52.479
I know you're upset.

35:52.481 --> 35:55.249
But you don't need to
take it out on Ms. J.

35:55.251 --> 35:56.351
See.

35:56.353 --> 35:57.651
I knew it.

35:57.653 --> 35:59.354
You love her too.

35:59.356 --> 36:01.255
Well to hell with you Jonsey.

36:01.257 --> 36:03.624
Now get the hell
out of my house.

36:03.626 --> 36:04.525
All of you.

36:04.527 --> 36:05.461
All right, wait, wait.

36:05.463 --> 36:06.661
Jenny you're being
hysterical all right.

36:06.663 --> 36:07.595
Let's just talk about this.

36:07.597 --> 36:09.699
Get out, get out, get out!

36:15.539 --> 36:18.606
Son of a bitch, they threw
our clothes all over the yard.

36:18.608 --> 36:19.409
Really?

36:20.510 --> 36:22.346
Someone's gotta get 'em, I mean.

36:23.347 --> 36:24.679
- Rock, paper, scissors?
- Uh, yeah.

36:24.681 --> 36:27.548
How are gonna play rock, paper,
scissors with four people?

36:27.550 --> 36:28.883
It's two versus two.

36:28.885 --> 36:29.818
That's works, a
little tournament.

36:29.820 --> 36:31.485
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

36:31.487 --> 36:32.320
- What?
- Ready Jonsey?

36:32.322 --> 36:32.957
Come on.

36:34.824 --> 36:35.759
- Oh!
- Ah.

36:40.563 --> 36:41.598
You ready?

36:43.367 --> 36:44.202
- Ah.
- Dammit.

36:45.735 --> 36:47.401
Good game.

36:47.403 --> 36:48.970
It's not that cold.

36:48.972 --> 36:51.940
Yeah okay, any requests?

36:51.942 --> 36:52.874
My purse.

36:52.876 --> 36:54.342
Make sure you get my purse.

36:54.344 --> 36:54.876
And everything else
that I was wearing.

36:54.878 --> 36:56.577
I want my tie.

36:56.579 --> 36:58.481
You want your tie, okay, okay.

36:59.650 --> 37:00.648
Sounds good.

37:00.650 --> 37:01.715
Make sure they
didn't curl my socks.

37:01.717 --> 37:02.617
Yeah, yeah, okay.

37:33.317 --> 37:35.583
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey.

37:35.585 --> 37:38.920
Think this is a safe
place right now, huh?

37:38.922 --> 37:40.458
Nobody else is here.

37:41.425 --> 37:42.057
Jonsey?

37:42.059 --> 37:43.425
What, what is it?

37:43.427 --> 37:44.793
There's uh something
by the dumpster.

37:44.795 --> 37:47.095
All right, I can't
tell what it is.

37:47.097 --> 37:48.662
I don't know if it's
a zombie or not.

37:48.664 --> 37:49.496
Where?

37:49.498 --> 37:50.764
By the dumpster.

37:50.766 --> 37:54.437
Hey, we see you over
there, come on out.

37:55.972 --> 37:57.642
What's nine times two?

37:58.675 --> 38:00.108
What?

38:00.110 --> 38:02.476
Zombies brains
are made of mush.

38:02.478 --> 38:04.748
Answer the question or
we answer with lead.

38:05.614 --> 38:06.648
Oh man, what?

38:06.650 --> 38:07.615
I stink at math.

38:07.617 --> 38:09.650
It's 18, it's 18, don't shoot.

38:09.652 --> 38:10.918
18.

38:10.920 --> 38:12.519
We're entering the
arena, all right.

38:12.521 --> 38:13.521
All right, look,
we're not zombies.

38:13.523 --> 38:14.625
We're just humans.

38:15.492 --> 38:16.691
The arena?

38:16.693 --> 38:18.959
That place is zombie
central station.

38:18.961 --> 38:20.061
I'm Jonsey.

38:20.063 --> 38:21.695
- This is BJ.
- Yeah.

38:21.697 --> 38:23.630
Over there's Wave.

38:23.632 --> 38:24.701
This is Ms. Johnson.

38:25.735 --> 38:28.739
And this person right here is?

38:29.539 --> 38:30.472
Uh?

38:30.474 --> 38:31.876
Seriously?

38:35.945 --> 38:36.947
- Lindsey?
- Yeah.

38:38.581 --> 38:40.081
Who's underwear is that?

38:40.083 --> 38:43.050
That'd be Chet's,
he volunteered.

38:50.460 --> 38:51.628
Let's go boys.

38:52.829 --> 38:53.762
Wait, where you guys goin'?

38:53.764 --> 38:54.628
We're
goin' to the U.P.

38:54.630 --> 38:57.400
Nobody's crazy
enough to go the U.P.

38:59.469 --> 39:00.769
They're pretty
crazy the way the laughed

39:00.771 --> 39:02.836
at our impending deaths.

39:02.838 --> 39:04.072
You know what?

39:04.074 --> 39:06.911
Let's forget about
them guys, let's go.

39:14.050 --> 39:14.952
Dead end.

39:22.692 --> 39:25.726
Oh shit, I don't want
to become a zombie.

39:25.728 --> 39:27.829
How do we not become zombies?

39:27.831 --> 39:29.030
I mean, I always like read

39:29.032 --> 39:31.166
in books that they
burn bodies right.

39:31.168 --> 39:33.001
That should stop it right?

39:33.003 --> 39:34.436
Oh shit.

39:34.438 --> 39:35.836
I should have put
that in my will.

39:35.838 --> 39:38.039
Cremate my ass so
I don't come back.

39:38.041 --> 39:41.543
I mean, I got your body
if you need a good burn.

39:41.545 --> 39:43.510
What are you
gonna burn me with?

39:43.512 --> 39:44.646
This.

39:44.648 --> 39:46.514
Man, you ain't
burnin' shit with that.

39:46.516 --> 39:47.148
What?

39:47.150 --> 39:48.816
Hey, hey, a door.

39:48.818 --> 39:49.983
Boys, door!

39:49.985 --> 39:51.020
Oh yeah.

39:52.856 --> 39:53.691
See.

39:58.994 --> 40:00.128
Oh here it is.

40:04.900 --> 40:05.900
Nice.

40:05.902 --> 40:09.804
- Cay-joon, cay-joon.
- Cajun Club dumb ass.

40:09.806 --> 40:12.574
- What's the Cajun Club?
- Two drink minimum anyone?

40:12.576 --> 40:14.075
Yeah, I'll take three.

40:14.077 --> 40:14.912
Oh yeah.

40:16.880 --> 40:19.914
Shots, I poured
one for everybody.

40:19.916 --> 40:21.816
- Yay.
- Way to go Wave.

40:21.818 --> 40:23.885
- One for you.
- Great.

40:23.887 --> 40:26.119
- One for you Jonsey.
- Thanks.

40:26.121 --> 40:27.722
Two for me.

40:27.724 --> 40:28.822
To the game, we won.

40:28.824 --> 40:31.928
- We won.
- Toast.

40:32.829 --> 40:33.961
- Cheers.
- Roast.

40:33.963 --> 40:36.097
And to Wave's mom!

40:36.099 --> 40:38.199
You watch your mouth when
you're talking about her.

40:38.201 --> 40:39.700
Oh man, I just want to
show my appreciation for...

40:39.702 --> 40:40.767
Be nice bro.

40:40.769 --> 40:41.905
I will end you.

40:42.771 --> 40:45.874
Okay.

40:45.876 --> 40:46.840
At this point
I don't even know

40:46.842 --> 40:48.008
if you guys are getting this.

40:48.010 --> 40:51.211
But not only do we have a
zombie apocalypse on our hands,

40:51.213 --> 40:53.847
there are also several
structure fires

40:53.849 --> 40:56.284
throughout the Park
Lawn neighborhood.

40:56.286 --> 40:59.686
Live, in Austin, Bryan Pyette.

40:59.688 --> 41:01.891
Mom, pick up your phone,
I'm tryin' to call you.

41:03.092 --> 41:05.559
Park Lawn is
Jen's neighborhood.

41:07.898 --> 41:10.632
I don't think, she's
probably gonna die there.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.902
Guys this is all my fault,
I gotta make it right.

41:14.170 --> 41:15.003
I gotta go back.

41:15.005 --> 41:15.802
You guys stay here.

41:15.804 --> 41:16.973
No fuckin' way.

41:18.007 --> 41:18.875
We're a team.

41:19.943 --> 41:21.545
We stick together.

41:24.114 --> 41:24.949
Ah.

41:26.583 --> 41:28.883
Well let's find
the way outta here.

41:28.885 --> 41:31.722
All right, let's go boys.

41:36.159 --> 41:37.659
When you need energy.

41:37.661 --> 41:38.959
When you need sparkle.

41:38.961 --> 41:40.695
When you need it to hit you

41:40.697 --> 41:42.896
and when it has to have ginseng.

41:42.898 --> 41:44.831
We're out of alphabets.

41:44.833 --> 41:46.166
I'ma scared.

41:46.168 --> 41:48.570
When you
need more than just pep,

41:48.572 --> 41:50.804
Ultro-pep, it delivers.

41:50.806 --> 41:52.173
Hey, hey.

41:52.175 --> 41:54.208
Well, well,
well, what do we got here.

41:54.210 --> 41:55.677
Hold on.

41:55.679 --> 41:56.878
We
got death dancers.

41:56.880 --> 42:01.014
Now what in the fuck are you
doin' in my fine establishment.

42:01.016 --> 42:02.784
Well you see your back
door was open right.

42:02.786 --> 42:05.052
And we were bein' chased
by zombies and we didn't...

42:05.054 --> 42:07.255
Zombies, we're all
runnin' from zombies, boy.

42:07.257 --> 42:09.289
That doesn't mean you get to
walk into my bar uninvited.

42:09.291 --> 42:11.228
It's just that, okay.

42:13.829 --> 42:16.831
And drinkin' all my
mutherfuckin' booze.

42:16.833 --> 42:20.834
You got some balls the
size of bells on you kid.

42:20.836 --> 42:21.802
- All right.
- Now how the hell

42:21.804 --> 42:23.371
- you gonna pay for it?
- We can pay for it.

42:23.373 --> 42:24.942
All right, we got money,
right guys, we got money.

42:26.675 --> 42:27.941
- Anytime now.
- You got anything?

42:27.943 --> 42:29.876
Oh, oh good, you
got some pepperoni.

42:29.878 --> 42:32.347
How 'bout I blow that dick
off of that pepperoni?

42:32.349 --> 42:33.981
We don't need to do that,

42:33.983 --> 42:35.083
- we don't need to do,
- Give me some goddam money.

42:35.085 --> 42:36.016
Wow, I have it.

42:36.018 --> 42:38.619
Oh thank you so much Lindsey.

42:38.621 --> 42:39.820
Give me the goddam money.

42:39.822 --> 42:41.023
Take it man, all yours,
it's all yours, just keep it.

42:41.025 --> 42:45.959
Thank you, thank you, $10
oh that's very nice of you.

42:45.961 --> 42:48.061
That's gonna pay for
about 1/10th of it.

42:48.063 --> 42:51.331
Now what the fuck am I
gonna do for the rest.

42:51.333 --> 42:53.700
- Um.
- I guess I'm just gonna have

42:53.702 --> 42:54.969
- to shoot you.
- No, no, no.

42:54.971 --> 42:57.871
No, no, we'll do anything,
sir, just anything.

42:57.873 --> 42:59.007
Anything right guys?

42:59.009 --> 43:00.008
We'll do anything.

43:00.010 --> 43:00.941
Anything you want.

43:00.943 --> 43:01.842
Just say it, just name it.

43:01.844 --> 43:03.911
- Well you'll do anything.
- Anything.

43:03.913 --> 43:05.014
- Anything.
- Yes.

43:07.983 --> 43:10.717
You know, I've been watching
you boys skatin' around

43:10.719 --> 43:14.889
at the hockey rink with those
tight little asses of yours.

43:14.891 --> 43:17.258
I kind want to touch
'em if I could.

43:17.260 --> 43:18.892
Reminds me of Dorothy Hamilton

43:18.894 --> 43:22.195
in the 1986 Olympics,
tight and white.

43:22.197 --> 43:23.865
What do you want with us?

43:23.867 --> 43:24.798
You know one thing
I think I'd like

43:24.800 --> 43:26.200
to see from you is maybe what

43:26.202 --> 43:28.939
those tight little asses
look like with pants off?

43:29.972 --> 43:32.005
- What?
- Yeah, I think I'd like

43:32.007 --> 43:35.846
to get those pants off of
you boys and watch you dance.

43:36.780 --> 43:38.979
- What?
- You fuckin' heard me.

43:38.981 --> 43:41.449
Get those pants off and dance.

43:47.724 --> 43:50.057
Why do we keep taking
off our clothes tonight?

43:50.059 --> 43:51.661
Wave just shut up.

43:52.996 --> 43:54.429
And dance.

43:56.099 --> 43:57.167
Shut and dance.

44:07.876 --> 44:11.012
He's like an Asian
hockey super dancing.

44:11.014 --> 44:13.684
Are you the captain of
the Chinese hockey team?

44:17.387 --> 44:20.121
- Come here.
- Shut up and dance.

44:27.163 --> 44:28.132
Oh, stop it.

44:33.068 --> 44:37.074
He moves it like he's
done it many times before.

44:53.155 --> 44:55.458
Oh this one's a naughty one.

44:59.128 --> 45:02.162
What are you the retarded
sidekick or somethin'?

45:02.164 --> 45:04.168
Whatever it is,
it's workin' for me.

45:14.043 --> 45:17.213
Oh it smells like
the swamp of love.

45:20.083 --> 45:21.215
Hey.

45:21.217 --> 45:23.217
Hey, we gotta get out of here.

45:23.219 --> 45:24.952
Who knows what that
guy's gonna do.

45:29.291 --> 45:31.092
We gotta get his gun somehow.

45:31.094 --> 45:32.226
Yeah, but how
we gonna do that?

45:32.228 --> 45:34.130
It's right next to him.

45:35.998 --> 45:39.099
Yellow's the new
color for gold.

45:45.942 --> 45:46.777
Stop it.

45:51.581 --> 45:53.050
- Hold my purse.
- Wait, what.

45:54.117 --> 45:55.916
Jesus Christ alive.

45:55.918 --> 45:58.121
I've died and I've
went to hockey heaven.

46:03.358 --> 46:05.293
You might have to
help me out of this.

46:05.295 --> 46:07.831
It's gettin' to hot in here.

46:10.065 --> 46:14.137
Oh mamacita, the redhead
cat comes walkin' at me.

46:15.572 --> 46:18.142
Let's find out, do the
curtains match the carpet.

46:20.443 --> 46:24.878
Wave, BJ, put your
clothes back on.

46:24.880 --> 46:26.447
We are getting' the
hell outta here.

46:27.382 --> 46:28.883
Hey Wave, nice moves.

46:28.885 --> 46:29.617
Did your mom teach you them?

46:29.619 --> 46:31.017
Hey what I tell you.

46:33.456 --> 46:35.559
What is wrong with you?

46:43.333 --> 46:45.235
- Oh.
- Let 'em have it.

46:50.005 --> 46:51.972
- Son of a bitch.
- Seriously.

46:51.974 --> 46:54.374
At least now we have something
to burn the bodies with.

47:48.297 --> 47:50.331
Jenny, it's Jonsey.

47:50.333 --> 47:52.700
Jenny, Jenny, hey!

47:52.702 --> 47:55.936
Oh, I thought you were
dead, so good to see you.

47:55.938 --> 47:57.405
But hey, hey, hey,
look at me, look.

47:57.407 --> 48:00.206
Wait, this entire
neighborhood's on fire, okay.

48:00.208 --> 48:01.275
We gotta, we gotta get out.

48:01.277 --> 48:03.244
Jonsey, it's okay,
everything is gonna be fine.

48:03.246 --> 48:04.577
Yeah, I don't
think you understand,

48:04.579 --> 48:05.612
like, everything's up in smoke.

48:05.614 --> 48:07.315
I'm so glad you came back.

48:07.317 --> 48:09.115
'Cause we're gonna be burnt
to a crisp if we stay here.

48:09.117 --> 48:11.217
Then we can be the family
I always wanted us to be.

48:11.219 --> 48:12.686
I don't think you're
listening to me.

48:12.688 --> 48:14.354
Like, when I say burnt to
a crisp, I mean like worse,

48:14.356 --> 48:15.188
Come on, sit down, let's go.

48:15.190 --> 48:16.222
than Dad's cooking.

48:16.224 --> 48:17.490
Come on, sit down.

48:17.492 --> 48:19.360
- Jonsey, sit.
- He's not dead.

48:19.362 --> 48:20.994
Sit, down.

48:20.996 --> 48:21.632
Now sit, good.

48:23.298 --> 48:25.132
Who cooked these beans.

48:26.268 --> 48:28.601
What, was it your Dad?

48:28.603 --> 48:30.570
He and I have some
big news to tell you.

48:30.572 --> 48:31.639
What, what, what news.

48:31.641 --> 48:34.008
We don't have any, what news?

48:34.010 --> 48:35.309
Why our engagement Jonsey.

48:35.311 --> 48:36.276
Our engagement!

48:36.278 --> 48:37.711
Oh, we're not engaged.

48:37.713 --> 48:41.048
You can ask Daddy for my
hand just like we talked about.

48:41.050 --> 48:43.083
All right, that's not
your dad, that is a dead...

48:43.085 --> 48:44.517
Ask him!

48:49.391 --> 48:54.397
Um,
Mr. James,

48:56.331 --> 49:01.270
nice zombie, um, I would
like to ask your daughter...

49:02.304 --> 49:03.403
- We've gotta go,
- What?

49:03.405 --> 49:04.637
- The fire is coming,
- Oh my god.

49:04.639 --> 49:05.639
And there's a horde of
zombies right outside,

49:05.641 --> 49:06.507
it's headed this way.

49:06.509 --> 49:07.608
You hear that?

49:07.610 --> 49:09.010
A horde of zombies is coming.

49:09.012 --> 49:10.043
What the fuck is
this bitch doing here?

49:10.045 --> 49:11.612
Not again.

49:11.614 --> 49:13.347
Hm, unless you want
an open marriage.

49:13.349 --> 49:14.548
No, no marriage.

49:14.550 --> 49:16.583
Oh honey, I do not
have time for your shit.

49:17.420 --> 49:18.519
Let's go.

49:18.521 --> 49:20.186
This is our
engagement party bitch,

49:20.188 --> 49:21.354
now get the hell
out of our house.

49:21.356 --> 49:23.456
Jonsey, what the
hell is wrong with her?

49:23.458 --> 49:25.693
I don't know,
let's just, guys.

49:25.695 --> 49:30.296
Man stealing, cradle
robbing, two bit slut cougar.

49:30.298 --> 49:33.266
You stay away from my man.

49:33.268 --> 49:34.501
He's mine.

49:34.503 --> 49:38.572
Yeah, that's enough you top
bun lip gloss lesbian bitch.

49:38.574 --> 49:40.374
Now you're gonna
leave this house

49:40.376 --> 49:42.776
and come with us right now.

49:42.778 --> 49:44.378
Or you're gonna die.

49:44.380 --> 49:47.280
And I'm about 30 seconds
from not giving a damn.

49:50.318 --> 49:52.221
Yeah, Jenny we need to go.

49:54.190 --> 49:55.322
What?

49:55.324 --> 49:56.289
You're on her side?

49:56.291 --> 49:58.325
I want to live, yeah.

49:58.327 --> 49:59.360
I knew there was
something going on

49:59.362 --> 50:00.728
between the two of you.

50:00.730 --> 50:02.162
Oh come on, don't
be like that Jenny.

50:02.164 --> 50:04.398
To find out at our
engagement party?

50:04.400 --> 50:06.200
Daddy!

50:06.202 --> 50:07.534
What?

50:07.536 --> 50:09.637
Oh hell no, all right,
Jenny it's over.

50:09.639 --> 50:10.440
Let's go.

50:11.706 --> 50:13.139
Let's get out of here.

50:13.141 --> 50:15.342
Jonsey, I thought
you were the one.

50:15.344 --> 50:18.179
But I guess you're
really into old ladies.

50:18.181 --> 50:19.813
Was it the Granny
Takes a Tinkle video?

50:19.815 --> 50:21.315
Is that what made you
go after the gray hair?

50:21.317 --> 50:24.150
I am not that fucking old.

50:24.152 --> 50:25.552
It's not worth it.

50:25.554 --> 50:26.720
Jonsey!

50:26.722 --> 50:29.222
No, stay with me
Jonsey, be my husband!

50:29.224 --> 50:30.458
Jenny watch out!

50:33.496 --> 50:34.327
- Jonsey, wait, she's gone.
- Jonsey, please help me!

50:34.329 --> 50:37.298
She's gone,
Jonsey, she's gone.

50:37.300 --> 50:38.769
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Let's go.

50:45.807 --> 50:47.309
Where's Jenny?

50:51.681 --> 50:53.813
Look man, we've got
to get going, okay?

50:53.815 --> 50:55.816
This whole neighborhood's
gonna burn down any minute.

50:55.818 --> 50:58.418
There's a horde
just up that street.

50:58.420 --> 50:59.155
All right?

51:01.657 --> 51:03.224
You're right.

51:03.226 --> 51:04.494
You're right, let's go.

51:11.701 --> 51:13.300
I hate you Jonsey!

51:13.302 --> 51:15.469
You two timing cheat.

51:15.471 --> 51:17.838
I curse you and
your little gang.

51:17.840 --> 51:20.544
Especially that slut
cougar with you.

51:21.811 --> 51:23.480
It's not worth it.

51:25.181 --> 51:28.485
I swear I'll get
you, I'll kill you all.

51:29.452 --> 51:31.288
And your little dog too.

51:32.454 --> 51:34.257
Wow, that's some
real medieval shit.

51:35.458 --> 51:37.226
Wait a minute, we have a dog?

53:05.581 --> 53:06.579
The back door boys.

53:06.581 --> 53:07.680
Huh?

53:07.682 --> 53:09.682
The back door, that's
how we get into the arena.

53:09.684 --> 53:10.918
The maintenance guy would
always leave it open for me

53:10.920 --> 53:12.586
so I could skate early.

53:12.588 --> 53:15.889
Okay, so how are we
supposed to get there?

53:15.891 --> 53:17.523
We got no pucks, and there are

53:17.525 --> 53:19.795
at least four dozen zombies
between us and there.

53:21.429 --> 53:25.634
Dude, I'm so pooped right
now, I can't run anymore.

53:26.434 --> 53:29.403
Well, guys.

53:29.405 --> 53:30.604
What?

53:30.606 --> 53:31.537
Where'd Rachel go?

53:31.539 --> 53:33.840
Who the fuck is Rachel?

53:33.842 --> 53:37.510
Dude, that super hot chick

53:37.512 --> 53:39.012
who's been with us
all fuckin' night.

53:39.014 --> 53:40.680
That's Rachel!

53:40.682 --> 53:42.583
Well, she knows
where we're headed.

53:42.585 --> 53:47.289
If, if, if she's okay she'll,
she'll meet us at the arena.

53:48.356 --> 53:49.523
Right?

53:49.525 --> 53:51.624
- Yeah.
- Really?

53:51.626 --> 53:52.862
- I'm sure she will.
- Yeah.

53:53.963 --> 53:55.565
She'll be fine.

53:56.498 --> 53:57.563
She's Rachel!

53:57.565 --> 53:59.599
She's you know,
tall and sturdy.

53:59.601 --> 54:00.501
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:00.503 --> 54:05.005
God help us, let's
just go, come on.

54:05.007 --> 54:05.842
Fuck.

54:15.318 --> 54:17.687
You guys, I thought of
this really good plan.

54:21.891 --> 54:23.490
Wow.

54:23.492 --> 54:24.358
They finally...

55:30.960 --> 55:31.795
Fuck!

55:33.396 --> 55:36.032
Your maintenance guy,
your buddy fucked us dude.

55:38.000 --> 55:38.835
Arena.

55:50.713 --> 55:51.715
I knew that.

55:57.820 --> 55:58.855
Oh man.

55:59.755 --> 56:01.423
You still have this?

56:10.498 --> 56:11.134
Mm.

56:39.527 --> 56:40.726
How are you even
on the hockey team?

56:40.728 --> 56:41.897
Duh, hey.

56:43.599 --> 56:45.965
On skates, I'm perfect.

56:45.967 --> 56:48.568
Walkin' on the ice I'm no good.

56:48.570 --> 56:50.003
Been that way
since I was a baby.

56:50.005 --> 56:51.771
I was born with skates on.

56:51.773 --> 56:54.141
So did you like come out
headfirst or skate first.

56:54.143 --> 56:56.880
- Boy, boys!
- Whoa dude.

56:58.581 --> 57:00.517
A few hours ago we were kids.

57:01.851 --> 57:02.983
Champions of our fate.

57:02.985 --> 57:04.753
Nobody told us what to do.

57:06.688 --> 57:08.588
But who are we now, huh?

57:08.590 --> 57:10.793
We're nobodies, that's who.

57:12.027 --> 57:14.126
We're just like everybody
else scrambling out there

57:14.128 --> 57:18.231
in the dark, praying
for one last period.

57:18.233 --> 57:21.834
When in reality, we're just
skating endless circles

57:21.836 --> 57:24.773
on this rink of life
until the game's over.

57:26.275 --> 57:27.673
And you know what?

57:27.675 --> 57:29.610
I personally don't want to die.

57:29.612 --> 57:30.776
I don't want to die in the hands

57:30.778 --> 57:33.813
of a disgusting zombie scum.

57:33.815 --> 57:35.081
Yeah.

57:35.083 --> 57:36.249
I don't want to
go out like that.

57:36.251 --> 57:37.117
I want to fight.

57:37.119 --> 57:38.584
Yeah.

57:38.586 --> 57:41.255
I want to live to come
back to this very arena

57:41.257 --> 57:43.289
and watch my son drop his,

57:43.291 --> 57:44.927
Oh wait, or, or.

57:46.295 --> 57:48.695
- Or daughter?
- Yes.

57:48.697 --> 57:51.865
Or daughter, drop
his or hers first puck

57:51.867 --> 57:53.900
onto this very ice.

57:53.902 --> 57:55.568
Jonsey, your shoes
have been untied.

57:55.570 --> 57:56.940
I will get to that BJ!

57:58.139 --> 58:02.041
Oh, yeah, all right
so first things,

58:02.043 --> 58:03.943
we gotta barricade
this entire place,

58:03.945 --> 58:06.313
make sure nobody
can get in, okay.

58:06.315 --> 58:07.481
Second is supplies.

58:07.483 --> 58:10.016
Hopefully there's still some
food left at concessions.

58:10.018 --> 58:12.221
Oh, yes, I love their nachos.

58:14.088 --> 58:15.858
- Huh, hold on a sec.
- Cool.

58:16.858 --> 58:18.592
What else.

58:18.594 --> 58:19.592
You caught that raccoon up
in your mom's attic, right?

58:19.594 --> 58:20.996
Yeah.

58:22.597 --> 58:24.298
Do you think you can booby
trap this entire place?

58:24.300 --> 58:26.833
Booby traps, man
I've got more ideas

58:26.835 --> 58:28.804
for traps than
Kevin McCallister.

58:31.106 --> 58:32.773
Huh, huh?

58:32.775 --> 58:33.941
Sniper post.

58:33.943 --> 58:36.976
I got like 100%
coverage up here, pop.

58:36.978 --> 58:38.112
Oh, I can tap
into the lighting

58:38.114 --> 58:40.983
or sound system so we can
control it from anywhere.

58:44.052 --> 58:45.052
What?

58:45.054 --> 58:46.889
Even cougars can be tech savvy.

58:49.358 --> 58:50.990
All right, good.

58:50.992 --> 58:53.726
Let's do this.

58:53.728 --> 58:54.563
Beat?

58:58.300 --> 59:02.001
- When are you gonna learn?
- Shut up.

59:07.976 --> 59:09.211
Awesome.

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:21.985
That right there?

01:00:22.885 --> 01:00:25.688
That's our last resort,
that's our Alamo.

01:00:28.956 --> 01:00:30.423
What's an Alamo?

01:00:30.425 --> 01:00:34.998
Uh, it's French,
for ice cream.

01:00:47.909 --> 01:00:51.413
Well boss, I think we're
uh, we should be pretty set.

01:00:53.215 --> 01:00:57.383
Maybe, uh, maybe we
can take a few minutes,

01:00:57.385 --> 01:00:59.956
maybe an hour, just
take some rest.

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.088
Morning will be in a few hours,

01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:04.760
can I just, can I just
lay down here Jonsey.

01:01:06.094 --> 01:01:06.961
- No.
- Set my alarm.

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:12.001
BJ, for once,
that sounds like a,

01:01:14.268 --> 01:01:19.274
like a very good idea.

01:01:24.045 --> 01:01:25.414
I'll take first watch.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.008
Wake, up, wake up boys.

01:01:57.079 --> 01:02:00.045
All right noise,
let's go check it out.

01:02:05.887 --> 01:02:06.889
Whoa.

01:02:10.192 --> 01:02:11.494
What's goin' on?

01:02:13.094 --> 01:02:17.165
I'm coming for you Jonsey.

01:02:20.501 --> 01:02:21.135
Love Jenny.

01:02:23.105 --> 01:02:25.141
Colon, hyphen end parenthesis.

01:02:26.007 --> 01:02:28.307
Wave, that's a smiley face.

01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:30.177
Wow.

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:32.211
I told you that was
some real big old shit.

01:02:32.213 --> 01:02:33.215
Yeah, thanks Wave.

01:02:36.485 --> 01:02:38.755
Hey, hey, steady.

01:02:42.891 --> 01:02:43.523
Steady.

01:02:43.525 --> 01:02:44.360
Nope.

Do you guys give you up?

01:03:10.385 --> 01:03:12.922
Or are you thirsty for more.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.633

taking our clothes!

01:03:48.155 --> 01:03:51.124
And this one is for
taking Wave's food.

01:04:00.202 --> 01:04:04.503
This one is for locking us in
the basement with a zombie!

01:04:07.509 --> 01:04:08.945
One, two, 10!

01:04:13.315 --> 01:04:15.282

01:04:25.626 --> 01:04:27.026
Oh my god.

01:04:27.028 --> 01:04:28.360

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:42.175
Okay.

01:04:42.177 --> 01:04:43.012

01:05:02.496 --> 01:05:04.697
Well that was easy.

01:05:04.699 --> 01:05:06.166
A little too easy.

01:05:22.416 --> 01:05:23.451

01:05:25.152 --> 01:05:26.720

01:07:51.166 --> 01:07:53.398
Son of a bitch!

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.403
Bruce, sir, well

01:07:59.474 --> 01:08:02.411
Don't touch me, mascots.

01:08:03.811 --> 01:08:04.779
Where's Jonsey?

01:08:10.485 --> 01:08:11.353
I'll kill him.

01:08:12.219 --> 01:08:12.855
Drop it.

01:08:16.524 --> 01:08:17.425
Good, good.

01:08:18.792 --> 01:08:22.562
Now Jonsey, we can
be together forever.

01:08:22.564 --> 01:08:24.296
Seriously?

01:08:24.298 --> 01:08:25.367
Ask me Jonsey.

01:08:26.301 --> 01:08:27.703
Tell me you'll love me forever.

01:08:29.404 --> 01:08:31.470
And I'll let your friends go.

01:08:37.444 --> 01:08:38.514
Sorry guys.

01:08:41.381 --> 01:08:42.216
You win.

01:08:46.386 --> 01:08:47.221
Jenny.

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:53.492
Will you.

01:08:53.493 --> 01:08:54.328
Don't do it!

01:08:56.497 --> 01:09:00.502
Will you, do me the honor.

01:09:04.939 --> 01:09:09.541
Will you, marry

01:09:18.453 --> 01:09:19.518

01:09:20.988 --> 01:09:21.823
Ow.

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:27.359
Not some bitch is takin'
this old woman's man.

01:09:31.865 --> 01:09:33.299
No!

01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:47.515
Oh yeah.

Let's get 'em boys!

01:10:15.743 --> 01:10:17.845
Let's wash this
zombie shit off us.

01:10:26.554 --> 01:10:29.321
Still lookin' for
his hidden penis.

01:10:29.323 --> 01:10:30.491
What do we do with him?

01:10:33.761 --> 01:10:36.295
I've, I've got an idea.

01:10:36.297 --> 01:10:36.898
Huh, huh?

01:11:27.582 --> 01:11:28.848
This is
far from over folks.

01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:30.616
They're suggesting you
get out of the city

01:11:30.618 --> 01:11:34.620
as soon as possible, fires
and zombies are everywhere,

01:11:34.622 --> 01:11:36.725
Brian Pyette,
reporting from the U.P.

01:11:37.926 --> 01:11:40.663
When you need
glitter, when you need sparkle.

01:11:42.764 --> 01:11:44.696
So what now Captain?

01:11:44.698 --> 01:11:45.697
Guess we get out of town.

01:11:45.699 --> 01:11:48.701
I don't think we're
all gonna fit in this.

01:11:54.676 --> 01:11:55.778
What's that?

01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:09.421
Oh!

01:12:09.423 --> 01:12:11.391
Oh my God.

01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:13.558
Barry Melrose!

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.027
Oh son of a bitch,

01:12:15.863 --> 01:12:16.698
Come on boys.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.069
Thank you, thank

01:12:27.108 --> 01:12:29.811
Hear it's safe in Moose Jaw.

01:12:52.734 --> 01:12:54.800
Mr. Melrose, what an honor.

01:12:54.802 --> 01:12:55.701
How'd you find us?

01:12:55.703 --> 01:12:56.705
Saw your spotlight.

01:12:57.704 --> 01:13:01.206
Son of a bitch.

01:13:11.219 --> 01:13:12.820
