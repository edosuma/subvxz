13:28.945 --> 13:30.280
There has been much debate,

13:30.347 --> 13:32.615
both internationally
and here in Markovia,

13:32.682 --> 13:35.351
about what to do
with Quraci refugees

following the invasion
of Qurac

13:36.986 --> 13:39.055
by the rogue state of Bialya.

13:39.122 --> 13:42.025
So, we will make our position
perfectly clear.

13:42.091 --> 13:44.093
Markovia will not
turn its back

13:44.160 --> 13:46.428

fleeing tyranny.

13:46.495 --> 13:49.165
Quracis are welcome
in Markovia.

13:49.232 --> 13:51.667
But that is not what we came
to discuss today.

13:51.734 --> 13:53.002
All over the world,

13:53.069 --> 13:55.638
children and teens
are being abducted.

13:55.705 --> 13:58.007
The way our daughter
was abducted.

13:58.074 --> 14:01.244
Meta-human trafficking
is an international scourge.

14:01.311 --> 14:04.613
Today, we pledge all
of Markovia's resources

14:04.680 --> 14:08.580

or not?

14:24.667 --> 14:26.969
(SIGHING SOFTLY) Yes.

14:27.036 --> 14:30.339
And yes, you tested positive
for the meta-gene.

14:30.406 --> 14:31.974
-Which means Tara--
-Yes.

14:32.041 --> 14:35.111
Princess Tara would likely
have tested positive as well.

14:35.178 --> 14:37.580
Which explains why
she was taken.

14:37.646 --> 14:40.016

is correct,

14:41.751 --> 14:43.086
how does that help?

14:43.152 --> 14:44.820

obviously have

14:44.887 --> 14:46.789
meta-humans working for them.

How does anyone without
his or her own meta-abilities

fight such people?

14:51.360 --> 14:53.128
Maybe he can't.

14:53.195 --> 14:55.064
But maybe...

14:55.131 --> 14:56.632
Does Markovia have
the technology

14:56.699 --> 14:58.768
to create its own meta-humans?

14:58.834 --> 15:00.703
To what end, Brion?

15:00.770 --> 15:03.372
To fight meta-fire
with meta-fire?

15:03.439 --> 15:04.907
Please answer the question.

15:04.974 --> 15:08.410

importance to all of us.

We need to vet every Quraci
in the country

20:38.874 --> 20:40.609
for meta-human powers.

20:40.676 --> 20:42.044
And that cannot be done

20:42.111 --> 20:45.281
without giving Markovia's
patriotic security forces

20:45.348 --> 20:48.717
the extreme authority
to get the job done.

20:48.784 --> 20:50.186
GORDON:<i>Well, of course not.</i>

20:50.253 --> 20:53.623
Now, what about the throne?

20:53.690 --> 20:58.690
Next in line is your nephew,
Prince Gregor. Correct?

20:58.827 --> 21:00.529
Indeed.

21:00.596 --> 21:02.932
But Gregor is only 17.

21:02.998 --> 21:05.602
So, until he comes of age
next year,

21:05.668 --> 21:08.404
<i>I will be acting
</i> <i>as his regent.</i>

21:34.029 --> 21:36.466
Hello, Dr. Jace?

JEFFERSON:<i>Good night,
</i> <i>Jennifer.</i> (KISSING)

21:39.935 --> 21:42.635
Good night, Anisa.

21:45.675 --> 21:48.277
I know it's late.
Thanks for letting me see 'em.

21:48.344 --> 21:50.646
(SCOFFING) Of course,
you're their father.

21:50.712 --> 21:52.014
I'm giving it up, Lynn.

21:52.081 --> 21:54.216
The life, all of it.

21:54.283 --> 21:55.951
-Mmm-hmm.
-Seriously.

21:56.018 --> 21:58.254
Jeff, I'm the sister
of a Green Lantern

21:58.321 --> 22:01.157
and the ex-wife
of a Black Lightning.

22:01.223 --> 22:03.425
I know how this
quitting-the-life thing goes.

22:03.492 --> 22:04.527
You mean it now,

22:04.594 --> 22:06.228
but sticking to it
is something else.

22:06.295 --> 22:08.597
Trust me, it'll stick.

22:08.664 --> 22:11.300
I have no choice.

22:11.367 --> 22:13.068
(SIGHING SOFTLY) No.

22:13.135 --> 22:14.537
Forget it. Don't even start.

22:14.604 --> 22:17.206
It's an entire meta-human
trafficking syndicate

22:17.273 --> 22:20.042
that we can take down
in one night.

22:20.109 --> 22:22.577
When it's all over,
we go our separate ways.

22:22.644 --> 22:23.713
I can't.

22:23.780 --> 22:26.148
<i>I know what happened
</i> <i>on Rann, Jeff.</i>

22:26.215 --> 22:27.950
But we can make sure
something like that

22:28.017 --> 22:29.251
never happens again.

22:29.318 --> 22:30.687
You're not hearing me.

22:30.753 --> 22:32.622
I'm not saying I won't,
I'm saying I can't.

22:32.689 --> 22:35.224
My powers,
they're not working.

22:35.291 --> 22:37.226
<i>I'm useless, broken.</i>

22:37.293 --> 22:39.796
I came for the man,
not the powers.

22:39.863 --> 22:42.832
You're a still a hero,
and I still need you on this.

22:42.899 --> 22:45.334
Midnight at
the Centennial Park Zeta-Tube.

22:45.401 --> 22:47.036
We'll wait five minutes.

22:47.102 --> 22:49.372
I won't be there.

22:49.438 --> 22:52.741
ORACLE:<i>I heard that.
</i> <i>Doesn't sound promising.</i>

22:52.808 --> 22:54.710
No, it doesn't.

22:54.776 --> 22:59.276

23:23.939 --> 23:25.274
Don't give me that look.

23:25.341 --> 23:27.109
One mission only. Agreed?

23:27.176 --> 23:28.478
Agreed.

23:28.544 --> 23:30.712
Time is short,
mission briefing en route.
