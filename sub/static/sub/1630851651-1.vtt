00:05.839 --> 00:10.511
Fact: the dictionary defines a hero as
a person who is admired for courage,

00:10.594 --> 00:13.138
outstanding achievements
or noble qualities.

00:13.222 --> 00:15.724
Now, if you ask
a bunch of third-graders...

00:15.807 --> 00:18.685
What does "hero" mean to you?

00:18.769 --> 00:20.062
Someone who can fly.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.648
Who avenges justice in her community.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.359
With super hearing and super vision.

00:25.442 --> 00:28.111
And saves the day
by throwing cars and stuff.

00:28.195 --> 00:31.240
I think there are a lot of
different kinds of heroes.

00:31.323 --> 00:32.491
-But--
-I know.

00:32.573 --> 00:34.868
It was rude of me to cut him off.
It's okay.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.912
That's Charles, my little brother.

00:36.995 --> 00:40.123
Anyway, ask those same kids
who their hero is...

00:40.207 --> 00:43.168
-My mom.
-Definitely my mom.

00:43.252 --> 00:45.712
-My dad.
-Billie Eilish.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.214
Which is funny,

00:47.297 --> 00:50.801
because none of my friends' parents
can fly or throw a car.

00:50.884 --> 00:54.263
You know, I'm not sure
about Billie Eilish, but I doubt it.

00:54.346 --> 00:59.309
Tensions ran high as local residents
and nearby businesses were evacuated.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.520
But thanks to the unwavering courage

01:01.603 --> 01:04.565
of the Middleton Fire Department's
first responders,

01:04.647 --> 01:07.651
-it looks like this...
-I really hope Dad's okay.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.736
He could certainly use a hot shower.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.488
-Hey.
-Dad!

01:12.281 --> 01:15.242
-Otherwise I'm great.
-Were you scared?

01:15.325 --> 01:18.537
You bet I was. If I'd gotten there
just a few seconds later,

01:18.620 --> 01:21.415
I would have missed out on
the last maple Crumbdillyicious.

01:22.624 --> 01:23.625
Glad you're safe.

01:25.127 --> 01:26.128
Did they sleep?

01:26.211 --> 01:29.089
Lizzie got eight hours.
Charles, not so much.

01:29.756 --> 01:33.218
-He worries about you.
-Did you save anyone's life?

01:33.302 --> 01:35.304
As a matter of fact, I did.

01:35.387 --> 01:39.600
A little girl, as she was trapped,
hiding in the corner of the cabin.

01:40.309 --> 01:41.685
You wanna meet her?

01:45.355 --> 01:47.232
A puppy!

01:48.984 --> 01:50.777
Can we keep her, please?

01:51.278 --> 01:54.239
-She could be my birthday present.
-That's not fair.

01:54.323 --> 01:57.034
-She should be my dog. I'm older.
-So?

01:57.117 --> 01:59.411
So I know way more about dogs than you do.

01:59.494 --> 02:02.414
-Guys, that's enough.
-You know more about dogs than anyone.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.167
-So what? Mom, tell her I'm right.
-Dad, come on.

02:05.250 --> 02:08.044
Okay. Hey. Listen up.
Your dad and I discussed this,

02:08.127 --> 02:10.255
and we don't think we're ready
for a puppy.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.382
-What?
-What? When did you discuss this?

02:12.466 --> 02:15.427
Just now.
We looked at each other like this.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.931
How's that a discussion?

02:19.014 --> 02:22.976
Just like when I look at you like this,
you know exactly what it means.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.523
-It means we can't keep her.
-The station is printing up flyers

02:27.606 --> 02:30.734
and sending an email blast
to see if we can locate her owner.

02:30.817 --> 02:34.238
Did you know if a missing pet's owner
hasn't been located within seven days,

02:34.321 --> 02:36.782
there's a 90% chance
that it's been abandoned?

02:36.865 --> 02:41.370
So, while you're looking for her owner,
where is she going to stay?

02:45.165 --> 02:47.793
I have a great feeling
about this discussion.

02:47.876 --> 02:48.877
Me too.

02:50.462 --> 02:54.883
I mean, it's only a few days.
How much damage can she do to the mudroom?

02:54.967 --> 02:56.844
-Yes!
-Yes! Thank you.

02:56.927 --> 02:57.928
Told ya.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.765
I just thought of a great name. Ashley.

03:01.849 --> 03:05.310
We can call her Ash,
since Dad found her in the ashes.

03:05.394 --> 03:08.564
Or, since she rose from the ashes,
we could call her Phoenix.

03:08.647 --> 03:11.149
I'm reading a book
on mythological creatures.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.861
But I like the name Ash too.

03:14.778 --> 03:18.323
Anyway, I have a work deadline,
so she's your responsibility.

03:18.407 --> 03:20.868
Feeding, cleaning,
keeping her out of trouble.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.202
We got it covered, Mom.

03:22.286 --> 03:28.333
And let's keep her off the new rug.
Your dad gets a pass this one time.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.671
Since it's Ash's first day
in a strange new place,

03:32.754 --> 03:36.341
I think it would be a great idea
for Charles and I to stay home from school

03:36.425 --> 03:39.678
-and keep her company.
-Yeah, that's a great idea.

03:39.761 --> 03:40.762
Can we?

04:05.621 --> 04:06.622
What?

04:18.634 --> 04:21.345
-Debate club?
-Just handed in my closing statements.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.805
-Cooking class?
-They ran out of flour.

04:23.889 --> 04:26.266
-Excellent. Bus stop at 3:00?
-Copy that.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.399
What a good pup.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.278
Who's a good pup? You are.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.867
I've been called many things,
Mr. Peterson, but a good pup...

04:43.951 --> 04:47.120
that's a first.
Hope you had a lovely nap.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.012
Hey, Charles, what's in the bag?

05:04.513 --> 05:07.975
Some vegan chili, pretzel dust,
half a grilled cheese sand--

05:08.058 --> 05:10.727
You can't just feed a puppy
random leftovers.

05:10.811 --> 05:14.314
-It has to have a well-balanced diet.
-Yeah, I know that.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.817
Okay, we can't make any mistakes.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.903
If we wanna convince Mom and Dad
to let us keep Ash,

05:19.987 --> 05:21.488
everything has to be perfect.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.452
Oh, boy.

05:27.536 --> 05:30.122
-Oh, God.
-What did you do?

05:32.624 --> 05:34.585
Yuck! You still smell like smoke.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.087
Okay. We have half an hour
before Mom gets home.

05:37.171 --> 05:39.089
I'll give her a bath. You clean the room.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.967
Why can't I give her a bath
and you clean the room?

05:42.050 --> 05:45.637
Charles, we don't have time to argue.
We have to work together as a team.

05:45.721 --> 05:47.472
That's the only way we'll keep her.

05:47.556 --> 05:49.808
Okay, but is she gonna be my dog
or your dog?

05:49.892 --> 05:51.852
Neither. She'll be our dog. Okay?

05:51.935 --> 05:54.479
Okay. Why can't I give her a bath
and you clean the room?

05:54.563 --> 05:57.691
You might get soap in her eyes.
We'd have to rinse it out with saline,

05:57.774 --> 06:00.736
which we don't have, because
Mom threw it out after Dad got LASIK.

06:00.819 --> 06:03.488
-Although we could make some with two--
-It's fine.

06:04.656 --> 06:08.243
-You wash the dog and I'll clean the room.
-Perfect. Come on, Ash.

06:17.794 --> 06:21.465
Mom just pulled up.
The mudroom's clean. How was Ash's bath?

06:25.511 --> 06:26.512
Surprising.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.265
-No way!
-Very much way.

06:30.766 --> 06:34.102
She was covered in soot. Turns out
she's actually a golden retriever.

06:34.186 --> 06:36.396
Lizzie? Charles?

06:36.480 --> 06:37.731
In here.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.442
Okay. Time to introduce Mom to...

06:40.526 --> 06:43.403
-Goldie.
-Goldie?

06:43.487 --> 06:46.031
Well, she doesn't look like
an Ash anymore, does she?

06:46.114 --> 06:48.450
Goldie the golden retriever?

06:50.285 --> 06:51.495
I like it.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.414
So, how was Ash's first day--

06:55.541 --> 06:56.542
Who's that?

07:04.591 --> 07:07.302
We were really worried
about smoke inhalation.

07:07.386 --> 07:09.137
It can be really bad for dogs.

07:09.221 --> 07:10.973
I think she knows that.

07:11.723 --> 07:16.270
I do see something in here.
A cute little pink puppy eardrum.

07:17.396 --> 07:19.356
Her lungs are good.
Her heartbeat's spot on.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.941
She is healthy and good to go.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.318
So, how much do we owe you?

07:23.402 --> 07:24.570
Let me see.

07:24.653 --> 07:28.949
Checkups on adorable puppies rescued
from burning buildings are on the house.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.743
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

07:31.827 --> 07:34.830
Thank you both for taking
such good care of Goldie. She's perfect.

07:34.913 --> 07:38.917
-Now all she needs is a lot of PLC.
-You mean TLC?

07:39.001 --> 07:42.629
No, PLC. Patience, love and consistency.

07:42.713 --> 07:45.382
I know she's not gonna get
a shortage of love from you two,

07:45.465 --> 07:49.094
-but puppy training can take time.
-If you have any tips...

07:49.678 --> 07:53.265
Well, I am a huge fan
of early interspecies socialization.

07:53.849 --> 07:55.475
Introducing her to other dogs.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.936
There has been some debate
in the pet care community,

07:58.020 --> 08:00.439
-but I feel they're--
-Debate.

08:00.522 --> 08:03.775
No, I'm late for the tournament.
I gotta go.

08:03.859 --> 08:06.778
Hey, please promise me
you will take her straight home.

08:06.862 --> 08:09.114
-Yeah. Promise.
-Bye.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.407
Bye.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.576
Get her all to yourself.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.830
Goldie, look.

08:22.085 --> 08:23.086
Hi.

08:24.421 --> 08:27.090
I saw your golden retriever
sitting in the window,

08:27.174 --> 08:30.469
and I thought that maybe
they could socialization-ize.

08:30.552 --> 08:34.472
Socialize? With Rufus? Oh, no, no, no.

08:34.556 --> 08:38.894
The only thing Rufus wants to do is
sit by himself and stare out that window.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.355
Why?

08:41.438 --> 08:46.026
He's been that way ever since
my beloved Henry passed away last year.

08:47.569 --> 08:48.946
I'm sorry.

08:52.741 --> 08:57.871
Look. I know you don't know me
or Goldie, but could we try?

08:57.955 --> 09:01.708
I mean, I think it could be
really good for her and Rufus.

09:01.792 --> 09:04.503
And then my parents might let me keep her.

09:04.586 --> 09:07.422
It couldn't hurt if they just meet, right?

09:08.006 --> 09:09.591
It could hurt all right.

09:09.675 --> 09:13.470
Rufus has gotten kind of prickly
in his old age,

09:13.554 --> 09:17.933
and your pup is much more likely
to end up a chew toy than a protégée.

09:18.016 --> 09:22.396
Now, you should go home,
and I need to get back to-- Rufus!

09:23.313 --> 09:25.440
Oh, no! Oh, no, no! Rufus!

09:25.524 --> 09:27.860
-Goldie, stop!
-Rufus, no! Rufus!

09:29.403 --> 09:31.446
Grandma, what's going on?

09:32.030 --> 09:34.575
That's what's going on, Sammy.

09:34.658 --> 09:37.828
-No way.
-Very much way.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.332
It's weird we've never seen each other
at school.

09:42.416 --> 09:46.003
I don't know too many kids. My grandma
and I just moved here four months ago.

09:46.670 --> 09:49.965
-Was that after your grandpa died?
-My grandpa?

09:50.048 --> 09:51.800
Your grandpa. Henry.

09:52.384 --> 09:56.054
No. Henry was our other dog.
He was really old.

09:58.640 --> 10:02.519
-Goldie really loves that bone.
-I can't believe Rufus let her have it.

10:02.603 --> 10:05.856
The peanut butter ones are his favorite.
He must really like her.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.316
I think she likes him too.

10:09.568 --> 10:11.528
Does Rufus do any tricks?

10:11.612 --> 10:14.281
A few. Hey, Rufus. Paw bump.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.368
Cool. Do you think you could teach Goldie?

10:18.452 --> 10:20.245
I don't know. But we can try.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.752
So, how was the debate?

10:26.835 --> 10:29.796
Your sister was amazing.
I think you would have enjoyed it.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.424
-Where were you?
-It's a long story, but--

10:32.508 --> 10:34.676
-Morning.
-You slept late.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.386
Morning.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.430
Rough night at the station.

10:38.514 --> 10:41.391
Took me forever to beat Lt. Fleckman
at Mega Cart Racer.

10:41.475 --> 10:45.312
Congrats. I know how hard you've been
working on your brake drifting.

10:45.395 --> 10:46.688
Any puppy updates?

10:46.772 --> 10:50.108
As a matter of fact,
I have both good news and bad news.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.195
Bad first, please.

10:53.278 --> 10:56.823
No one has come forward to claim her,
so it looks like you were right.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.408
Goldie might have been abandoned.

10:59.535 --> 11:03.539
-So, the good news is?
-A newlywed couple saw the flyer,

11:03.622 --> 11:06.250
and they are very interested in
adopting Goldie.

11:07.417 --> 11:10.504
-They're coming this weekend to meet her.
-You said good news.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.464
That's the worst news ever!

11:12.548 --> 11:16.635
-Honey, we said a few days.
-No, you said a few days.

11:16.718 --> 11:21.306
Come on. Goldie is such a good puppy.
And smart. Watch.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.102
Wait, what are you doing?

11:25.686 --> 11:27.980
Charles,
I told you to keep her off the new rug.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.440
I taught her a trick. Trust me.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.151
Okay, Goldie. Paw bump.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.531
Come on, you know this. Paw bump.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.158
Goldie, no!

11:40.993 --> 11:43.370
Come on, little girl.
Hey. Let's go outside.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.372
Charles, meet me in the kitchen.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.916
And bring both of your piggy banks.

11:50.335 --> 11:53.630
Great trick, Charles.
Thanks for ruining any chance we ever had.

11:56.133 --> 11:59.094
So, yeah. I totally blew it.

12:02.931 --> 12:04.600
Lizzie won't talk to me...

12:05.726 --> 12:08.687
which I guess isn't all bad, but still.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.939
Wait, no. Here, use this.

12:12.191 --> 12:14.359
It's the only straw you'll ever need.

12:14.443 --> 12:17.696
I mean, do you know
how many trees that saves? And turtles.

12:17.779 --> 12:20.282
I bet my parents
won't even let me have a turtle now.

12:20.365 --> 12:23.744
That's a good thing. Turtles are
much happier in their natural habitats,

12:23.827 --> 12:25.913
and they can live
for over a hundred years.

12:25.996 --> 12:28.874
I mean, like,
who would take care of it then?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.251
I'm just saying.

12:32.169 --> 12:35.547
I'm gonna have to wait
until I'm a grown-up to get a puppy.

12:35.631 --> 12:36.632
Well,

12:36.715 --> 12:40.594
if you wanna bring Goldie to my house,
we can maybe teach her more tricks.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.930
Then maybe your parents
will change their minds

12:43.013 --> 12:45.849
-before those people come to meet her.
-I don't know.

12:45.933 --> 12:50.938
Please. Rufus is sad. He spends all day
just staring out the window.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.106
But he loved playing with Goldie.

12:53.190 --> 12:56.068
And so did I.
She reminds me a lot of Henry.

12:56.652 --> 13:01.240
Why not? I guess the worst that can happen
is she pees on your grandma's rug.

13:02.533 --> 13:04.201
-Paw bump?
-Yeah.

13:12.501 --> 13:15.003
-It's me.
-That's why I locked it.

13:15.087 --> 13:19.466
Come on, Lizzie. I know I messed up.
But I think I know a way I can fix it.

13:20.634 --> 13:25.180
But I can't do it without you.
We're a team, right?

13:34.606 --> 13:36.400
Okay, Rufus. Sit.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.361
There you go. Your turn.

13:39.444 --> 13:42.030
-Hey, Goldie. Up, and then sit.
-Up.

13:42.698 --> 13:45.868
To sit you gotta stand up.
So, up and then sit.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.381
She really loves
those peanut butter bones.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.151
Hey, Charles.

14:19.735 --> 14:23.906
Listen, I feel bad for getting
so mad at you. You didn't deserve it.

14:24.489 --> 14:28.160
I mean, a lot of the times you do,
but... not this time.

14:28.243 --> 14:31.538
It's okay.
You thought we were gonna lose Goldie.

14:31.622 --> 14:34.583
-I'd be mad too.
-Not just that.

14:34.666 --> 14:38.086
I think sometimes
I like to feel in control.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.546
Sometimes?

14:40.214 --> 14:44.426
Anyway. As part of a team,
I know I can't control everything.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.261
You get a pass this one time.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.096
Thanks.

14:48.180 --> 14:52.100
Okay. We have three days to train Goldie
until those people come.

14:52.184 --> 14:54.811
And then when Mom and Dad
see how amazing you are,

14:54.895 --> 14:56.897
you get to live with us forever.

14:59.775 --> 15:00.776
Come on.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.653
Come on. Come on.

15:04.363 --> 15:05.614
And here they are.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.324
And this must be Goldie.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.409
You are so cute.

15:09.493 --> 15:10.577
Kids, meet the Lus.

15:10.661 --> 15:14.957
I thought they weren't coming
till Saturday.

15:15.040 --> 15:18.418
We've been staring at Goldie's picture
every day. We couldn't wait.

15:18.502 --> 15:20.504
-Can we pet her?
-Yeah.

15:21.421 --> 15:25.509
Just, right now she-- she's thirsty.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.679
-Yeah, thirsty.
-Yeah. She-- You know, you gotta hydrate.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.433
Okay. So, couple questions.

15:33.934 --> 15:35.352
Is your yard fenced in?

15:35.853 --> 15:38.814
It is. Three acres,
so there's plenty of room for her to run.

15:39.481 --> 15:43.193
I mean, that's good, but she can't just
run around all the time by herself.

15:43.277 --> 15:46.154
It's important that there's
someone home most of the day.

15:46.238 --> 15:49.241
-Lizzie.
-I work from home.

15:49.324 --> 15:52.327
I'm an organic chef, and you'll be
happy to know I plan on cooking

15:52.411 --> 15:53.704
all Goldie's food myself.

15:53.787 --> 15:57.249
Puppies have very different
nutritional needs from adult dogs.

15:57.332 --> 15:59.209
I think we've got it covered.

16:00.711 --> 16:02.880
Don was actually
in his third year of vet school

16:02.963 --> 16:05.465
when he left to start up
his own eyeglass company.

16:05.549 --> 16:07.301
For every pair of glasses we sell,

16:07.384 --> 16:10.220
we donate one to a needy child
from an underdeveloped country.

16:10.304 --> 16:15.017
-So, college dropout? I don't know.
-Lizzie, that's enough.

16:15.726 --> 16:19.396
I'm sorry.
They've grown quite attached to the puppy.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.899
It's totally understandable.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.650
Sorry, here's Goldie.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.781
-Wish me luck.
-Peanut butter?

16:31.116 --> 16:32.409
So cute.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.037
Hey, Mom,
is it okay if we let Goldie off the leash?

16:35.120 --> 16:39.249
I think it would be good for the Lus
to see her when she's more relaxed.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.960
-You know a lot about dogs.
-Sure do.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.128
Okay.

16:46.673 --> 16:47.591
Cute.

16:53.764 --> 16:54.723
My purse.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.770
Just being a puppy.
Okay, Goldie. Put it down.

17:01.146 --> 17:02.105
-Goldie.
-Okay.

17:03.815 --> 17:04.858
I-- Goldie.

17:07.611 --> 17:08.612
Oh, God.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.573
Goldie, you definitely have a wild streak.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.539
That will go down in history.

17:18.622 --> 17:21.750
The great puppy peanut butter prank
of the twenty-first century.

17:21.834 --> 17:25.127
I don't think the Lus will be
getting a puppy for a long time.

17:27.798 --> 17:29.591
You know, I hope you're wrong.

17:29.675 --> 17:33.011
They'd be a great family,
just for the right dog.

17:33.095 --> 17:36.765
As long as it's not Goldie. She's ours.

17:36.849 --> 17:40.227
-Well, that was something.
-I know.

17:40.310 --> 17:44.439
It's so interesting how dogs behave
around people they just don't like.

17:44.523 --> 17:49.111
And look how she acts
around the people who she does like.

17:49.194 --> 17:50.946
You're not mad at her, are you?

17:51.029 --> 17:53.907
Of course not. It's not Goldie's fault.

17:53.991 --> 17:56.410
We had no idea what a handful she was.

17:56.493 --> 17:59.788
What do you mean?
And why do you have Goldie's leash?

18:00.706 --> 18:04.334
Your dad and I found a wonderful
animal shelter right here in Middleton.

18:04.418 --> 18:08.255
They're better equipped to handle
an energetic puppy like Goldie.

18:08.338 --> 18:10.382
And it really is the best option for her.

18:10.465 --> 18:13.552
-I'm gonna drop her off tomorrow.
-Dad, you can't!

18:13.635 --> 18:17.306
Honey,
this is a debate you're not going to win.

18:17.389 --> 18:19.641
You two can say goodbye
in the morning, okay?

18:20.559 --> 18:21.768
Come on, sweetheart.

18:26.648 --> 18:27.649
Come on.

18:29.151 --> 18:32.821
I messed up... again.

18:41.330 --> 18:42.331
Hey.

18:45.042 --> 18:46.877
Couldn't wait until the morning either?

18:46.960 --> 18:49.922
You know how I can never sleep
when Dad's out fighting a fire?

18:50.005 --> 18:50.923
Yeah?

18:51.006 --> 18:53.634
Well, Goldie has a mom and dad too.

18:54.676 --> 18:56.553
Probably brothers and sisters.

18:56.637 --> 18:59.515
Do you think she wonders
if they're ever gonna come back?

19:01.141 --> 19:02.267
I don't know.

19:02.351 --> 19:06.605
Now all she has is us.
And we're giving her away.

19:06.688 --> 19:07.940
It's not fair.

19:08.023 --> 19:12.402
Well, you know, Charles, so many people
are gonna see Goldie at that shelter.

19:12.486 --> 19:15.322
They're gonna fall in love with her
and wanna take her home

19:15.405 --> 19:17.074
and make her part of their family.

19:18.534 --> 19:20.494
Do you really think so?

19:21.745 --> 19:24.081
-I do.
-I hope you're right.

19:24.748 --> 19:28.961
You know, sometimes if you believe
good things will happen, they do.

19:29.044 --> 19:33.465
That's why I can sleep when Dad's away.
I always know he's gonna come home safe.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.224
Hey.

19:42.307 --> 19:45.727
Morning. I just got a strange voice mail
from Don Lu.

19:45.811 --> 19:49.147
Something about being able
to make a sandwich with his pants.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.816
And then we found this.

19:52.860 --> 19:54.152
Uh-oh.

19:54.236 --> 19:58.115
And that was the plan: to train Goldie
with Rufus every day this week

19:58.198 --> 20:01.702
so you could see how great she is
and finally let us keep her.

20:01.785 --> 20:04.663
But the Lus came early
and ruined everything.

20:04.746 --> 20:08.000
You know, if you think about it,
it's actually all their fault.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.835
-Yeah.
-So, yeah.

20:09.918 --> 20:12.796
-Are you done?
-One more thing.

20:12.880 --> 20:16.216
Charles and I will agree to
a 50% allowance reduction

20:16.300 --> 20:21.054
for however long it takes to pay back
the Lus for ruining her expensive purse.

20:21.138 --> 20:22.347
And his pants.

20:22.431 --> 20:23.515
Yep.

20:23.599 --> 20:25.934
-Now we're done.
-Okay.

20:26.018 --> 20:28.604
Let me tell you two something
about good parenting.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.273
Okay. All right.

20:31.356 --> 20:36.862
Listen up. No matter how hard you try,
you make mistakes, a lot of them.

20:37.988 --> 20:40.532
At the end of the day,
that's not what's important.

20:40.616 --> 20:44.244
Because the most important thing
about being a good parent

20:44.328 --> 20:46.496
is doing what's best for your kids.

20:47.247 --> 20:50.918
So your point is
you know what's best for us,

20:51.001 --> 20:53.003
and that's giving away Goldie?

20:53.086 --> 20:56.465
And even though we totally disagree,

20:56.548 --> 20:59.760
it doesn't matter,
because you're being good parents?

20:59.843 --> 21:01.762
You two messed up. All right?

21:01.845 --> 21:05.641
Like your dad said,
all good parents make mistakes.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.811
Wait, we're the good parents?

21:09.895 --> 21:11.063
When you were little,

21:11.146 --> 21:14.816
we were having a terrible thunderstorm
and you could not fall asleep.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.735
Wanna know what your dad and I did?

21:16.818 --> 21:19.905
We built a blanket fort
and stayed with you all night long.

21:19.988 --> 21:22.950
Looked a lot like the one
you two built for Goldie.

21:23.033 --> 21:24.618
I think we used the same blankets.

21:26.411 --> 21:32.417
And when we saw that, we both realized
you're ready for a puppy of your own.

21:32.501 --> 21:33.585
-Really?
-What?

21:33.669 --> 21:35.754
And we didn't even have to
look at each other.

21:35.838 --> 21:37.047
-Yes!
-Oh, my...

21:37.130 --> 21:39.716
But only after you call the Lus
and apologize.

21:39.800 --> 21:43.053
And promise to keep her off the rug
until we put in a doggy door.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.263
-Okay. Deal.
-Yes! Okay.

21:44.346 --> 21:45.472
Come on.

21:45.556 --> 21:49.309
-Goldie! Goldie! Goldie!
-Goldie! Goldie, guess what? Goldie.

21:50.602 --> 21:52.479
Goldie? Where is she?

21:54.523 --> 21:56.942
-Goldie?
-Goldie?

21:57.025 --> 21:58.652
Come on. It's okay, girl.

22:00.529 --> 22:02.573
-Charles?
-What?

22:04.575 --> 22:07.494
I think Goldie might have made
her own doggy door.

22:09.204 --> 22:11.498
-Goldie!
-Goldie!

22:11.582 --> 22:14.251
-Goldie!
-Goldie! Where is she?

22:14.334 --> 22:16.879
Do you think she knew
she was going to the shelter?

22:16.962 --> 22:20.549
She's smart, but not that smart.
Maybe she just wanted to play?

22:20.632 --> 22:22.885
That doesn't make sense.
Why would she run away?

22:22.968 --> 22:25.554
-She can play with us.
-I don't know, Charles.

22:27.014 --> 22:29.224
I know where she is. Follow me.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.786
Look at them playing. Like BFFs.

22:50.704 --> 22:53.916
-That's how he used to play with Henry.
-I know.

22:56.376 --> 22:59.171
You must be so happy
your parents are letting you keep Goldie.

22:59.254 --> 23:02.633
-Yeah. Yeah.
-What's wrong?

23:02.716 --> 23:06.720
Nothing. She just looks really happy
playing with Rufus.

23:07.221 --> 23:10.015
Yeah. Really happy.

23:18.315 --> 23:20.609
My sister and I just had a discussion,

23:20.692 --> 23:24.571
and we were wondering how you'd feel
about adopting Goldie.

23:24.655 --> 23:25.697
What?

23:26.990 --> 23:28.575
Look, we love Goldie.

23:28.659 --> 23:32.287
But what's most important
is what's best for her.

23:32.371 --> 23:33.872
And for Rufus.

23:34.498 --> 23:37.125
And you, and you, Sammy.

23:37.209 --> 23:38.919
Really? Are you sure?

23:39.503 --> 23:40.504
Yeah.

23:42.130 --> 23:43.131
We're sure.

23:43.215 --> 23:45.884
Grandma, can we? Please?

23:49.429 --> 23:50.806
On one condition.

23:50.889 --> 23:55.519
The two of you have to agree
to be Goldie's godparents.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.980
-Deal.
-Deal.

23:58.063 --> 23:59.648
I think we have a deal.

24:00.274 --> 24:03.110
Hey, Rufus, come. We've got amazing news.

24:04.528 --> 24:05.779
Goldie, come.

24:07.447 --> 24:08.448
Goldie.

24:09.783 --> 24:13.495
Don't worry. My friend Sammy
is an excellent dog trainer.

24:15.080 --> 24:18.125
I'm not worried a bit.
I think they're gonna be best friends.

24:22.045 --> 24:25.299
Anyway, if you were wondering
what Charles was gonna say earlier

24:25.382 --> 24:27.050
when I cut him off, here you go.

24:27.134 --> 24:30.345
You know, he's actually pretty smart
for a third-grader.

24:30.429 --> 24:32.139
I mean, he is my brother.

24:33.390 --> 24:36.518
I think there are a lot of
different kinds of heroes,

24:36.602 --> 24:40.022
but the one thing they all have in common
is helping others.

24:40.105 --> 24:44.359
And those others don't have to be people.
They can be dogs too.

24:44.443 --> 24:48.280
Dogs are awesome.
They give us companionship and love.

24:48.363 --> 24:51.617
And sometimes help us make new friends.

24:51.700 --> 24:55.204
But they need us to take care of them
and be their heroes.

24:58.457 --> 24:59.499
The end.
