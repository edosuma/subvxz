17:46.466 --> 17:52.339
I got it, I got it.
I do this.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.712
Looks like we got
some visitors.

18:06.853 --> 18:09.356
Okay, class, since this
is our first field trip,

18:09.356 --> 18:12.292
I want you to obey a few
very simple rules, okay?

18:12.292 --> 18:15.595
Ugh. Dirt.
Nice footwear.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.298
Perfect for spelunking.
I don't want you
to touch anything.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.033
Don't move anything.
Don't even breathe
unless we tell you to...

18:21.033 --> 18:23.203
and wear your
protective gloves
at all times.

18:23.203 --> 18:26.506
Why do we have to do this?
Firsthand field experience,
that's why.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.575
The very meat and potatoes
of geology.

18:28.575 --> 18:31.077
Is this gonna be
on the final?
Yes.

18:31.077 --> 18:33.680
Officer, nice to see you again.
Hey, Professor.
What's up?

18:33.680 --> 18:37.550
We came to pick up the rock.
Pick it up? What?

18:37.550 --> 18:40.520
Yeah, well, we're--
Just orders from the U.S.G.S.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.722
They want it under
controlled conditions.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.524
It's very technical.

18:44.524 --> 18:47.427
Oh, technical stuff.
It's technical.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.229
So, yeah, okay.
Go right ahead.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.664
We're just gonna haul it
right on out of here.
Sure, go ahead.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.334
Deke and Danny,
remember what we
talked about, right?

18:54.334 --> 18:58.338
You guys are in charge
of the hoisting. I want you
to get the winch to the hole.

18:58.338 --> 19:03.142
Okay, fellas, stop nodding
and just stare at me
for a second, okay?

19:03.142 --> 19:05.077
Focus.

19:05.077 --> 19:08.215
You understand
what I want you to do?
Yeah, we got you.

19:08.215 --> 19:10.717
Yeah.
Go do it.

19:20.860 --> 19:25.131
Ira, I'm picking up
a heavy creepy vibe here.

19:25.131 --> 19:27.734
Yeah, a lot has changed.

19:29.969 --> 19:31.971
Class, I know
these look like mushrooms,

19:31.971 --> 19:34.741
but please try to refrain
from eating them.

19:38.211 --> 19:41.248
Ugh!
It smells disgusting.

19:41.248 --> 19:44.517
Nadine,
sometimes science stinks.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.520
It's the game we play, baby.

19:50.890 --> 19:54.193
Rotten egg smell.
Hydrogen sulfide, right?

19:54.193 --> 19:57.964
Yeah, and ammonia and methane.
It's like it's converting
the atmosphere.

19:57.964 --> 20:01.701
Look at all this
rudimentary plant life.
It's amazing.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.572
I don't wanna get
all girly here,

20:05.572 --> 20:08.575
but I think I feel something
wiggling around my toes.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.515
The ground
does seem to be moving.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.626
Whoa!

20:26.626 --> 20:30.096
Flatworms.
Millions of them!

20:30.096 --> 20:33.833
Eww! God! Ohh!

20:33.833 --> 20:36.035
God!
Ohh! Whoa!

20:36.035 --> 20:38.838
Barely 18 hours,
and we already
have flatworms.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.240
Look, look, look!
Hey, there they are!

20:41.240 --> 20:43.242
Hi, Dr. Kane!
Hey, Dr. Kane!

20:43.242 --> 20:45.812
Ohh!

20:45.812 --> 20:48.648
Man, I almost went down
on that one!
That was awesome.

20:51.217 --> 20:53.853
Come here, little buddy.

20:57.624 --> 21:01.828
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

21:06.232 --> 21:08.601
You didn't hurt it.
You killed it.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.937
The oxygen must have killed it.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.640
Must need its own
atmosphere to live.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.476
Yeah. Why don't you
grab a specimen jar?

21:16.476 --> 21:21.481
We'll try to scoop
some of the atmosphere
in there with them.

21:21.481 --> 21:25.585
Took us two billion years
to do what they did
in just a couple of days.

21:25.585 --> 21:29.756
Yeah. Those little germs
are the embodiment
of the American dream.

21:29.756 --> 21:33.760
Ahem. I'm, um,
so sorry to interrupt,
Professor Block,

21:33.760 --> 21:37.697
but am I correct
in assuming that that
little field trip...

21:37.697 --> 21:40.700
fulfilled my missing
credit requirements?

21:40.700 --> 21:44.270
You know, Nadine,
you're a very,
very smart girl,

21:44.270 --> 21:47.039
but if you would just focus--

21:50.510 --> 21:55.114
Um, Professor, the little
wiggly worm things in there
are breaking.

21:55.114 --> 21:57.784
Ira, look.
Yeah.

22:02.021 --> 22:05.458
[ Ira ]
No, it's not breaking.
It's splitting.

22:05.458 --> 22:08.194
It's mitosis.
That's how they reproduce.

22:08.194 --> 22:12.031
No sex?
No time for sex.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.800
Bummer.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.669
Oh, little guys
are splitting again.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.806
Put it away.
Look, we call no one,
we tell no one.

22:19.806 --> 22:22.174
This is our secret,
right?

22:22.174 --> 22:24.677
What about the government?
Is this the kind of thing
they usually get involved in?

22:24.677 --> 22:30.282
No. No government.
I know those people.
Absolutely not.
You do?

22:30.282 --> 22:33.553
Look, this is our discovery
and we have to maintain
absolute control.

22:33.553 --> 22:38.024
We have to do more research
and check our findings,
document everything.

22:45.765 --> 22:48.267
[ Man ]
Hey, Wayne.

22:48.267 --> 22:51.971
[ Sighs ]
What's this?

22:51.971 --> 22:54.874
That would be
an all-cotton towel, sir.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.777
I believe a Fieldcrest.
It's a damp towel,
Wayne.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.779
What the hell
is a damp towel
doing on my chaise?

22:59.779 --> 23:03.015
Okay. Let me go
take care of this for you.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.117
You should, Wayne,
because you're
the pool manager.

23:05.117 --> 23:11.357
If anyone knows what
to do about the dampness
on my chair, it's you.

23:11.357 --> 23:15.462
"Oh, you know what to do
with the towels 'cause
you're the pool boy."

23:21.000 --> 23:23.503
What the hell?

23:28.274 --> 23:33.813
[ Water Bubbling ]

23:33.813 --> 23:35.948
Where did you guys
come from?

23:51.531 --> 23:53.866
You're dead now.
[ Bubbling ]

24:06.979 --> 24:08.781
Whoa! What the--

24:15.488 --> 24:17.624
Okay.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.862
Hey, Harry, when I checked
the samples this morning,

24:22.862 --> 24:24.931
I found
three different subspecies.

24:24.931 --> 24:27.867
I mean, these things
are evolving so quickly.

24:27.867 --> 24:30.503
God knows
what we're gonna find
when we get back.

24:30.503 --> 24:33.205
Whoa!
Whoa!

24:35.875 --> 24:38.978
Please tell me there's
an air show today.
Damn.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.951
Ah, shit.

24:54.561 --> 24:56.896
Can I help you?
Harry Block, Ira Kane.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.898
United States
Geological Society.

24:58.898 --> 25:02.068
We're doing some
important research.
This is our site.

25:03.803 --> 25:06.038
I'm sorry. Not anymore.
You're not on the list.

25:06.038 --> 25:09.308
What do you mean?
We come here all the time.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.911
This is not a nightclub.
Take it somewhere else.

25:11.911 --> 25:14.146
Hey, I know
my constitutional
rights, okay?

25:14.146 --> 25:16.182
You can't tell me--
Harry! Harry! Look,

25:16.182 --> 25:20.219
maybe you can
call your superior,
we can have a word with him.

25:23.155 --> 25:25.391
I have a Harry Block
and an Ira Kane out here....

25:25.391 --> 25:27.927
saying they have some
connection to the site.
Punk.

25:27.927 --> 25:30.730
What?
You gotta know how
to talk to the white man.

25:30.730 --> 25:33.566
The white man about
to get his ass whupped.
He doesn't like to be yelled at.

25:33.566 --> 25:35.568
Did you say Kane?
Ira Kane?

25:35.568 --> 25:38.571
Yeah. Yeah.
The Ira Kane?

25:38.571 --> 25:42.709
Oh, I've been looking forward
to this for a long time.
You bastard!

25:42.709 --> 25:45.511
[ Soldier ]
You're history!
Hey, hey, hey!

25:45.511 --> 25:47.947
Get his gun!
You're crazy!

25:47.947 --> 25:50.316
Take it easy!
All right, they're good. Up!

25:50.316 --> 25:54.453
You're responsible
for the worst month of my life!
Let me go!

25:54.453 --> 25:56.889
What the hell
was that about?
I don't know.

25:56.889 --> 26:01.160
All right, drive straight down
to the command tent.
They're expecting you.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.762
Go.
Thank you.

26:02.762 --> 26:05.798
That's the guy that
had me in diapers
for over a month!

26:05.798 --> 26:08.267
Let me go!
Who the hell was that?

26:37.229 --> 26:39.531
Gentlemen, just up here.
General Woodman's
expecting you.

26:39.531 --> 26:43.502
Russell Woodman?

26:43.502 --> 26:46.605
Ha ha! Ira!

26:46.605 --> 26:49.008
Ohh!
What an unexpected
surprise.

26:49.008 --> 26:52.011
For me too. I didn't realize
we were on a hugging basis.

26:52.011 --> 26:55.414
The same old Ira Kane.
And you must be?

26:55.414 --> 26:59.451
Harry Block, this is
General Russell Woodman,
head of U.S. Army research.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.821
General.
Harry.

27:01.821 --> 27:04.023
So you two know each other?

27:04.023 --> 27:06.025
Ira used to work for me.
Right, Ira?

27:06.025 --> 27:08.594
I worked with you, actually.

27:08.594 --> 27:12.932
Ira, you used to work in
Army research at the Pentagon?
Yeah.

27:12.932 --> 27:15.001
And all this time I thought
you were just a schoolteacher.

27:15.001 --> 27:17.603
No. How did you find out
about this, Russell?

27:17.603 --> 27:22.008
You leave the Pentagon,
you don't call me,
you don't write.

27:22.008 --> 27:24.243
We like to keep tabs
on our prodigal sons.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.545
So you tapped my phone?

27:26.545 --> 27:28.480
No. We're not
the KGB, Ira.

27:28.480 --> 27:32.618
Actually, we've been
monitoring your computer.

27:32.618 --> 27:35.054
His computer?

27:35.054 --> 27:38.190
All those girls in the photos
are over 18.

27:38.190 --> 27:41.427
Yes, I'm sure.
I should have figured.

27:41.427 --> 27:45.564
You should've known better
than to try to keep something
this big from us.

27:45.564 --> 27:48.034
And the C.D.C.
Ah!

27:48.034 --> 27:50.069
Just in time.
Ira, this is Allison Reed,

27:50.069 --> 27:55.007
senior researcher
in epidemiology
at the... C.D.C.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.709
[ Harry ]
Nice underwear.

27:56.709 --> 27:59.011
A garter belt
at a day function?

27:59.011 --> 28:01.413
I can do it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. I'm okay.

28:01.413 --> 28:04.016
I'm okay. Dr. Kane.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.085
I'd heard about
your recklessness,

28:06.085 --> 28:08.487
but you are way out of line
on this one.

28:08.487 --> 28:10.890
Do you realize
how dangerous this situation
could have become?

28:10.890 --> 28:14.927
It's nice to meet you too.
No need to play
the blame game here.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.996
No harm, no foul.
Suffice it to say...

28:16.996 --> 28:21.200
that we're all very appreciative
the discovery made
by Dr. Kane and Mr. Black.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.904
Block.
Block.
I'm sorry.

28:24.904 --> 28:27.473
The confirmation of
the existence of life
outside this planet--

28:27.473 --> 28:29.675
Would be the greatest
scientific discovery...

28:29.675 --> 28:31.944
of our time.
Yes, actually.

28:31.944 --> 28:36.916
Yes, and you have my word
that you'll be kept in the loop
from this point forward.

28:36.916 --> 28:39.752
Oh, you son of a bitch.
What do you mean,
kept in the loop?

28:39.752 --> 28:41.720
General, we are the loop.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.256
We're not gonna cut you out,
but we do need to take control.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.859
We're just
following protocol, Ira.
You remember protocol.

28:46.859 --> 28:50.696
I got some protocol
right here for you, Russell.
Come and get it!

28:50.696 --> 28:53.165
Look, the simple fact is,
this research
must continue...

28:53.165 --> 28:55.201
under careful
government control
and scrutiny.

28:55.201 --> 28:57.203
We've already
secured the area.

28:57.203 --> 28:59.271
We're constructing
an air lock into the cavern...

28:59.271 --> 29:01.440
and a state-of-the-art
field research facility.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.542
So, you see,
there's not a whole lot...

29:03.542 --> 29:08.180
for the science department
of Glen Canyon Community
College to do here.

29:08.180 --> 29:11.183
Did you catch that condescending
tone with he says "Glen Canyon
Community College"?

29:11.183 --> 29:13.385
We are following
well established
federal guidelines.

29:13.385 --> 29:16.155
Please, Russell.
Don't pull this crap.
We deserve to be here.

29:16.155 --> 29:19.725
You deserve
to be here?

29:19.725 --> 29:22.995
You're lucky anybody's ever
let you near a science
laboratory again, Ira.

29:24.530 --> 29:28.134
You're a disgrace,
and a dangerous one
at that.

29:31.170 --> 29:34.473
Lieutenant,
show these men out.

29:34.473 --> 29:37.509
This is horseshit.

29:37.509 --> 29:40.179
This is not over.

29:40.179 --> 29:43.182
You're in for a fight,
Russell.

29:43.182 --> 29:47.186
Would you stop
following me, please?
Thank you.

29:47.186 --> 29:50.189
We're not gonna
bend over and take this!

29:50.189 --> 29:53.625
Fruit basket
for Russell Woodman!

29:53.625 --> 29:55.962
Happy holidays,
General!

29:57.796 --> 30:01.567
Cute.

30:01.567 --> 30:06.205
Dr. Kane, are you asking me
to bar the federal government...

30:06.205 --> 30:09.608
from involvement in a discovery
as significant as this one?

30:09.608 --> 30:11.944
No, not at all.
We're asking you
to make sure...

30:11.944 --> 30:15.114
that the local scientists who
actually made the discovery...

30:15.114 --> 30:17.216
continue to play
a significant role.

30:17.216 --> 30:19.351
They've kept us out
for almost two weeks.

30:19.351 --> 30:23.222
We put our lives on the line
to find these little guys,
Your Majesty.

30:23.222 --> 30:26.092
We just want to
be there for them
as they grow up.

30:26.092 --> 30:28.794
We were the first team
at the meteor site,

30:28.794 --> 30:30.863
and all the initial testing
was done in our lab, Judge.

30:30.863 --> 30:35.234
The facilities at Glen Canyon
Community College are a joke.

30:35.234 --> 30:38.737
They weren't a joke
when I went there, General.

30:38.737 --> 30:40.806
Okay.

30:40.806 --> 30:45.444
Your Honor, if the court
would allow me
to depose Dr. Kane?

30:45.444 --> 30:47.479
Depose me?

30:47.479 --> 30:50.049
We think your past
is very relevant, Dr. Kane.

30:50.049 --> 30:55.254
These issues speak directly
to his competence
as a scientist.

30:55.254 --> 30:58.057
Dr. Kane, you were
a top-level researcher...

30:58.057 --> 31:03.295
at USAMRID from '94 to '97,
were you not?
Yes, that's correct.

31:03.295 --> 31:06.732
And you were
summarily dismissed
in the summer of 1997.

31:06.732 --> 31:09.936
Any idea why?

31:09.936 --> 31:12.338
My services were
no longer required?

So in your opinion,
your firing...

31:14.941 --> 31:17.643
had nothing to do
with an experimental
anthrax vaccine...

31:17.643 --> 31:21.147
that you developed
and administered to nearly
140,000 U.S. soldiers...

I see where
you're going with this.

to the soldiers that were
inoculated with your vaccine?

what you're asking.

Um, well, as with
any new vaccine,

there were certain
side effects
associated with it.
