00:05.125 --> 00:06.197
Previously on E. R.

00:06.198 --> 00:09.389
I have Samantha Sobriki with me.
She's looking for her husband.

00:11.322 --> 00:14.671
I got a message in my answering machine
from Lucy Knight.

00:14.672 --> 00:16.985
- When is Kerry coming back?
- Who said she is?

00:17.605 --> 00:21.612
- No, Carter! What's the matter with you?
- He's violent.

00:21.613 --> 00:25.234
It was an accident! This is Pablo,
they don't come any gentler.

00:25.235 --> 00:29.804
I am not an invalid!
I can still make it to the damn bathroom...

00:29.805 --> 00:31.408
- ... by myself!
- Dad. Sit down. Come on, sit down.

00:31.409 --> 00:36.414
You don't give your mommy and daddy
any trouble, do you? Beautiful family.

00:39.147 --> 00:41.852
E. R. 6x19 "THE FASTEST YEAR"

00:42.025 --> 00:44.860
- Keep it in, Dad.
- I have to cough, Mark.

00:45.028 --> 00:48.278
Well, you don't have to talk.
Put it back in.

00:48.489 --> 00:51.360
- Want me to bite down on it?
- Dad.

00:51.576 --> 00:53.782
End up with a mouthful of mercury.

00:53.869 --> 00:55.198
Dad.

00:55.704 --> 00:57.911
- All right. Say "E."
- E.

00:58.123 --> 01:00.080
- Once again.
- E.

01:00.292 --> 01:03.328
- Last time.
- E. Cripes!

01:03.587 --> 01:07.454
Sounds like pneumonia.
We have to get you a chest film.

01:07.674 --> 01:12.668
- Hell, Mark! Do we have to?
- Have something better to do today?

01:12.887 --> 01:17.679
- It's Sunday. We could go to church.
- Yeah, right.

01:17.892 --> 01:21.510
- Temperature's 101.
- Oh, big deal.

01:26.191 --> 01:29.145
- Morning, Randi.
- Dr. Weaver, welcome back.

01:29.319 --> 01:31.525
- Kerry, nice to see you.
- Robert.

01:33.656 --> 01:36.823
Have enough time
to rethink your choices?

01:37.034 --> 01:40.699
You get buried here
with Mark taking extra time off?

01:40.913 --> 01:45.989
No, I love being close with my troops.
You didn't answer my question.

01:46.209 --> 01:51.001
- I don't intend to.
- I'll take your presence as a yes.

01:51.172 --> 01:55.004
I didn't appoint you chief
so you could turn soft on me.

01:55.176 --> 01:57.050
No. I know you didn't.

01:57.261 --> 01:59.883
And you do realize
I can un-appoint you...

02:00.097 --> 02:03.181
...should you be unable
to uphold our standards?

02:03.350 --> 02:07.811
- Yes, I do.
- Well, then, top of the morning to you.

02:08.981 --> 02:10.558
John?

02:13.485 --> 02:16.569
- John.
- Oh, man!

02:17.197 --> 02:19.569
- What time is it?
- Quarter past 7.

02:19.782 --> 02:21.691
How about some breakfast?

02:23.619 --> 02:25.861
Maybe just some toast.

02:26.914 --> 02:29.072
Did you get any sleep?

02:31.501 --> 02:34.372
I gave up trying around 2.

02:35.422 --> 02:38.921
I came down and watched
a couple of infomercials.

02:39.425 --> 02:43.375
I ordered a machine
so you can make your own beef jerky.

02:43.596 --> 02:46.513
- You didn't!
- I didn't.

02:46.682 --> 02:48.509
Then I came in here.

02:50.144 --> 02:54.058
Seems it's the only room in the house
where you can sleep.

02:54.273 --> 02:56.894
Maybe we should put a bed in here.

02:58.568 --> 03:00.228
Somebody!

03:02.697 --> 03:03.728
John.

03:06.075 --> 03:07.700
What?

03:07.910 --> 03:10.781
I wish you'd talk to somebody
about your not sleeping.

03:12.373 --> 03:14.033
I'll be fine.

03:14.458 --> 03:16.166
You want a slice?

03:16.376 --> 03:17.835
Absolutely.

04:08.466 --> 04:11.171
- Wanna play hoops?
- She's bulking up now.

04:11.386 --> 04:13.129
- I'm sorry.
- I can take it.

04:13.346 --> 04:15.587
As soon as I'm done "bulking up."

04:15.806 --> 04:18.926
- You guys go ahead.
- She's so bad, it's no fun.

04:19.142 --> 04:22.761
- I could kick your butt.
- Go, both of you. Now.

04:22.980 --> 04:26.811
I'd like to say excuse my kids,
but there's no excuse.

04:26.983 --> 04:29.142
I grew up with three brothers.

04:29.319 --> 04:32.485
Peter tells me
you're from Indianapolis.

04:32.697 --> 04:35.366
- Your family still live there?
- They do.

04:35.575 --> 04:38.066
Could you go shut them up, please?

04:38.286 --> 04:42.117
- Don't ask her a million questions.
- Go, go!

04:42.331 --> 04:46.280
So... Any of your brothers
become doctors too?

04:46.460 --> 04:48.369
A couple of them work for my dad.

04:48.587 --> 04:51.837
- And that would be in...?
- He's in insurance.

04:52.007 --> 04:54.960
It's a good line of work.
You didn't want to do that?

04:55.927 --> 05:01.051
Working and living so close,
family can be stifling. Not all, of course.

05:01.265 --> 05:03.174
Of course.

05:04.351 --> 05:07.934
- Have another waffle.
- Thanks.

05:10.274 --> 05:14.485
- Transfer. One, two, three.
- Get a CBC, chem panel and urine dip.

05:14.694 --> 05:16.521
Delia, what happened?

05:16.696 --> 05:21.737
Daddy was taking me to Shelly's house,
and this car hit us really fast.

05:21.951 --> 05:25.071
- She have any medical problems?
- She had leukemia.

05:25.413 --> 05:26.244
You know what kind?

05:26.339 --> 05:28.864
AML.
She's been in remission for eight months.

05:29.083 --> 05:30.577
How's your arm?

05:31.001 --> 05:35.461
- Looks like you'll need sutures.
- I want to stay with Delia.

05:35.672 --> 05:38.542
- Haleh.
- We can do it right here.

05:38.758 --> 05:42.092
- You okay, Daddy?
- It's a little cut. They'll fix me.

05:42.262 --> 05:46.804
- I had stitches once. It's not bad.
- I'll try to be as brave as you are.

05:47.016 --> 05:48.973
- Okay?
- Okay.

05:49.185 --> 05:51.307
Can't go wrong with a Chevy.

05:51.395 --> 05:53.434
I have gone wrong many times, in a Chevy.

05:53.547 --> 05:55.207
I always admired the Subaru.

05:55.240 --> 05:58.975
I say go with something classic
like an old Mustang convertible.

05:59.152 --> 06:02.984
- Two babies, remember?
- How about the police auction?

06:03.198 --> 06:05.486
- What do you drive, Luka?
- An old Saab.

06:05.658 --> 06:08.030
Swedes have a high suicide rate.

06:08.119 --> 06:09.198
What's this all about?

06:09.370 --> 06:11.279
I'm gonna buy a new car.
I mean, a new used car.

06:11.372 --> 06:12.603
What? Today?

06:12.623 --> 06:15.873
- My mom's got the twins.
- What time are you off?

06:16.085 --> 06:19.121
- About an hour. Why?
- Go to the place I got mine.

06:19.296 --> 06:22.996
I know the guy. He'll give you
a good deal. I can come with you.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.834
- Take a guy with you.
- They only listen to Al.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.633
- They listen to me. But I'm on.
- Me too.

06:29.847 --> 06:33.596
- Sure you don't mind?
- I just have a few cases to finish.

06:33.809 --> 06:35.387
- Okay. Thanks.
- Good.

06:35.561 --> 06:39.261
Dr. Corday?
CBC's back on Delia Chadsey.

06:39.440 --> 06:43.852
White blood count of 60,000.
Fifty percent blasts.

06:44.069 --> 06:45.444
Her leukemia's back.

06:45.654 --> 06:47.869
She never got a marrow transplant.

06:47.913 --> 06:49.697
You want me to talk to the father?

06:49.866 --> 06:53.282
- No. I can do it.
- Thanks.

06:56.205 --> 07:00.665
- Mark, I heard your father's here.
- Malik's getting him settled in.

07:00.876 --> 07:01.907
What is it?

07:02.044 --> 07:04.961
Rhonchi and consolidation in lungs.

07:05.172 --> 07:07.294
Wanna go check on him now?

07:07.465 --> 07:09.541
I didn't wanna be here either. But my son...

07:09.634 --> 07:12.207
...has the last word in medical things.

07:12.387 --> 07:14.712
I know. My son's a first-year med.

07:14.931 --> 07:18.181
Only thing worse is first-year law:
my daughter.

07:18.351 --> 07:20.509
Mark, this is Sarah MacKenzie.

07:20.686 --> 07:24.304
We're kindred spirits
in being hospital hostages.

07:24.481 --> 07:28.395
- How do you do? Nothing serious.
- My shin got infected.

07:28.902 --> 07:33.065
- Hello, David. How are you?
- I'm still here. Can't be too bad.

07:33.239 --> 07:36.074
- Want a portable chest?
- Go to Radiology.

07:36.284 --> 07:39.154
Get a P.A. and lateral.
He must stay on O-2.

07:39.328 --> 07:44.868
This is Elizabeth Corday. She and my
son are, what you call it, "friends."

07:45.042 --> 07:48.826
- Hello.
- Looks like you have your hands full.

07:49.004 --> 07:51.921
- I can do that.
- I got it. Five of albuterol.

07:52.132 --> 07:54.457
- Start a saline lock?
- I can do that.

07:54.634 --> 07:59.510
- Sure.
- Not bad. Two doctors. No waiting.

07:59.722 --> 08:03.969
- Reece went out like a light.
- Not only can she eat, she can play.

08:04.143 --> 08:08.010
Kids like her. What about you?

08:08.230 --> 08:11.895
Since when do you care what I think?
Do you like her?

08:12.109 --> 08:14.600
I wouldn't have brought her here if I didn't.

08:14.694 --> 08:16.507
Are you serious about her?

08:16.738 --> 08:18.944
Jackie, it's early to be serious.

08:19.115 --> 08:23.195
I hope so. Because she's
not serious about you.

08:24.704 --> 08:27.740
All right.
What's that supposed to mean?

08:27.915 --> 08:32.162
I'm just saying. She's having fun.
She's not ready to settle down.

08:32.336 --> 08:37.211
- Who says I am?
- You're not settled with a 3-year-old.

08:37.424 --> 08:39.630
That doesn't mean marriage.

08:39.801 --> 08:42.967
She's nice, we have fun.
But it's not serious.

08:43.179 --> 08:46.180
Good. Glad to hear it.
Then I like her too.

08:47.975 --> 08:50.181
Female intuition again?

08:50.394 --> 08:52.885
- Certainly not.
- Did she say something?

08:53.063 --> 08:57.939
She had to.
I asked a million questions.

09:00.779 --> 09:05.357
Edgar's mother is a nurse upstairs.
She's finding someone to fill in.

09:06.201 --> 09:07.825
What are you thinking, meningitis?

09:07.994 --> 09:11.279
Fever, vomiting, headache.
I need help with the LP.

09:11.956 --> 09:14.363
- Is he lethargic?
- He's sleepy.

09:14.583 --> 09:16.991
Can you roll him up in a ball?

09:20.464 --> 09:24.757
All right, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be just fine.

09:24.968 --> 09:28.301
Okay. Good position.
Okay, here we go.

09:29.264 --> 09:31.256
Steady.

09:32.475 --> 09:34.432
Okay. I'm ready.

09:34.685 --> 09:36.974
Good. I'm in.

09:37.146 --> 09:38.854
I feel the pop.

09:39.023 --> 09:41.858
Did you feel the pop? Keep going.

09:42.609 --> 09:44.068
- I can't-
- Yes, you can.

09:44.277 --> 09:48.227
- Stop, please! You 're hurting me.
- Calm down!

09:48.406 --> 09:50.114
What's sticking in my back?

09:50.325 --> 09:53.160
Give him more Ativan.
Lucy, keep going!

09:53.369 --> 09:56.453
- It'll be a traumatic tap.
- It won't get any easier.

09:56.622 --> 09:58.496
- Let's get this to the lab.
- Right away.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.907
There you go, Edgar.
This isn't so bad, is it?

10:03.003 --> 10:06.419
Your medication will wear off soon,
and you won't feel so sleepy.

10:08.550 --> 10:10.174
Thanks, Carter.

10:13.847 --> 10:16.005
Carter.

10:16.224 --> 10:17.766
Thanks.

10:17.934 --> 10:20.092
Yeah, sure. No problem.

10:21.896 --> 10:24.647
Ever discuss a bone-marrow transplant?

10:24.857 --> 10:28.724
No HLA-matched relative.
I only matched three antigens.

10:28.902 --> 10:31.440
- You've done this before.
- Big time.

10:31.655 --> 10:34.821
She's gonna need
reinduction chemotherapy.

10:34.991 --> 10:36.818
Chemo again?

10:37.368 --> 10:40.903
Oh, man. God, we were so hopeful.

10:41.080 --> 10:44.247
Into her second remission,
they can try a BMT.

10:44.417 --> 10:48.248
- If they can find a donor.
- There are no other possibilities?

10:50.088 --> 10:53.125
- No. Not exactly.
- Not exactly?

10:53.341 --> 10:56.841
- Her half sister hasn't been tested.
- Why not?

10:57.387 --> 11:00.304
She's from my first marriage.
Ugly divorce.

11:00.515 --> 11:03.930
- My ex isn't inclined to help.
- Not to save a child?

11:04.101 --> 11:08.146
We should go ahead with the chemo.
Then just go from there.

11:08.314 --> 11:12.097
Sure. I'll check with the
National Registry in Milwaukee.

11:12.317 --> 11:14.559
A match with an unrelated donor
is better than nothing.

11:14.736 --> 11:16.314
Thank you.

11:23.369 --> 11:25.741
- Are you ready yet?
- Just about.

11:25.955 --> 11:30.451
CVA is being admitted to medicine,
seizure patient can go home...

11:30.626 --> 11:34.873
...Edgar's LP says no meningitis,
we're waiting for his lytes.

11:35.088 --> 11:39.382
- His mom had to go back to work.
- I'll check on him. Good luck.

11:39.593 --> 11:41.087
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

11:44.472 --> 11:46.263
Edgar, how are you doing?

11:46.474 --> 11:49.510
What's she got?
Why does she have that stick?

11:49.727 --> 11:51.684
- It's okay.
- What's she gonna do?

11:51.896 --> 11:55.395
- Nobody's gonna do anything.
- Don't let her touch me!

11:55.607 --> 11:57.232
- It's-
- Wait a minute now.

11:57.401 --> 12:02.027
- Get her away from me!
- It's all right. Sweetie!

12:02.239 --> 12:04.361
- Get her away from me!
- Okay.

12:04.574 --> 12:06.116
Get her away from me!

12:06.326 --> 12:09.825
- I'm sorry, Dr. Weaver.
- I guess he's feeling better.

12:10.038 --> 12:13.122
Get him, Conni.
Get Malucci if you need help!

12:14.291 --> 12:16.996
- Mark
- Hey.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.790
- How is he?
- Making new friends as usual.

12:22.007 --> 12:26.300
I got the films back.
It is post-obstruction pneumonia.

12:26.511 --> 12:31.801
- Gave him cefotaxime, IV piggyback.
- So are you going to keep him here?

12:32.016 --> 12:36.512
For a while. Make sure he doesn't
react badly to the antibiotics.

12:36.729 --> 12:39.813
I'll stop in and say hello.

12:40.190 --> 12:42.646
So can I do anything to help?

12:42.860 --> 12:45.813
Just gonna steal some supplies.
Don't tell.

12:46.029 --> 12:48.520
Well, I love stealing. Let me help.

12:50.283 --> 12:52.774
Saline flushes. Need alcohol wipes.

12:52.869 --> 12:55.194
Okay. Check.

12:55.955 --> 12:59.039
Two-by-twos, extension tubing?

12:59.208 --> 13:02.162
Extension tubing, check.

13:02.544 --> 13:04.786
- Needles and syringes.
- Syringes.

13:06.715 --> 13:08.542
Syringes.

13:09.676 --> 13:11.336
Mark?

13:12.095 --> 13:14.550
Needles and syringes.

13:15.390 --> 13:16.884
I'm gonna...

13:18.017 --> 13:21.931
I'll need to borrow
more infusion bottles of cefotaxime.

13:22.146 --> 13:26.855
He'll be on antibiotics for 10 to 14 days,
depending on how he responds.

13:27.026 --> 13:29.101
Yeah, of course.

13:33.114 --> 13:36.863
- It would've been faster with my car.
- That's okay.

13:37.076 --> 13:39.484
- Unfortunately, it's in the shop.
- What?

13:39.662 --> 13:43.956
Routine checkup. Nothing wrong.
It's a good place. Herb's great.

13:44.125 --> 13:47.161
- Herb?
- He and I are like this:

13:47.378 --> 13:51.541
He's my second cousin's wife's
brother-in-law.

13:51.715 --> 13:54.288
That would definitely
make you like this.

13:55.093 --> 13:58.841
- Excited?
- About buying a used car? No.

13:59.013 --> 14:03.640
- My mom thinks I should get a minivan.
- They're very good. Practical.

14:03.810 --> 14:06.810
- Great. My life is over.
- Don't say that.

14:07.021 --> 14:09.559
We'll have them put
a Porsche engine in.

14:09.732 --> 14:14.524
- Really?
- No. I'm sorry. I was kidding.

14:16.279 --> 14:21.025
- Bringing you wasn't such a good idea.
- We'll get you a really good car.

14:21.201 --> 14:24.534
- Mrs. Pooler, any allergies?
- What's wrong?

14:24.746 --> 14:27.663
Tachy at 120.
Pulse ox is 91 on two liters.

14:28.207 --> 14:32.287
- You on medication?
- Just a pill for high blood pressure.

14:32.461 --> 14:34.039
- Proprana...
- Propranolol?

14:34.254 --> 14:36.792
- Propranolol.
- With asthma?

14:36.965 --> 14:40.049
That can kill you.
Who's your doctor?

14:40.260 --> 14:44.554
- Mr. Pooler?
- It's my medication for high BP.

14:44.764 --> 14:49.924
Ruth has Medicare, and they won't pay
for her prescriptions. Enalo...

14:50.144 --> 14:53.145
- Enalapril?
- Yeah, it costs $50.

14:53.314 --> 14:57.726
We just have our social security.
We thought she could take mine.

14:57.901 --> 15:00.357
See, I'm in an HMO.
I get them for free.

15:01.029 --> 15:03.816
If you're in an HMO,
why isn't your wife?

15:04.032 --> 15:07.732
I take many pills for my heart.
She just has asthma.

15:07.952 --> 15:12.116
Wanted to keep her own doctor,
but the HMO won't let her do that.

15:13.416 --> 15:15.325
- Found your runaway.
- Where?

15:15.501 --> 15:18.371
Cafeteria, eating tapioca pudding.

15:18.587 --> 15:20.247
- He okay?
- He seems fine.

15:20.464 --> 15:25.802
Good. His labs came back. Elevated BUN
and creatinine. His potassium's low.

15:26.011 --> 15:29.925
Give him a saline bolus,
10 per kilo, on maintenance.

15:30.140 --> 15:32.891
- You want me to take him?
- Spiff him up.

15:33.059 --> 15:34.387
Sure thing, chief.

15:35.103 --> 15:36.976
I don't think this is right.

15:37.146 --> 15:42.520
No. You'd have remembered if it had
been across the street from a stadium.

15:42.693 --> 15:46.441
Doesn't seem like a natural place
for a used-car lot.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.570
Gee, no, it doesn't.

15:49.407 --> 15:51.815
- I'm hungry.
- Yeah. Me too.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.992
What do you think? A hot dog?

15:55.371 --> 15:58.289
- It's here.
- Sorry about this.

16:02.336 --> 16:05.539
- Mr. Chadsey?
- I was getting Delia some water.

16:05.714 --> 16:09.057
I spoke to the Legal department
and there is nothing we can do...

16:09.092 --> 16:10.550
...to make your ex-wife-

16:10.635 --> 16:13.589
I didn't ask you to check on that.
What are you doing?

16:13.805 --> 16:17.138
- You should talk to her.
- I told you she won't help.

16:17.350 --> 16:21.264
- Then let me try. Mr. Chadsey-
- I said no!

16:25.483 --> 16:30.228
I just want to be with Delia.
Don't make this harder than it is.

16:32.739 --> 16:34.696
Is this really necessary?

16:34.908 --> 16:39.735
Propranolol lasts 24 hours. She needs
continuous breathing treatment.

16:39.913 --> 16:41.739
Such a fuss. I'm sorry.

16:41.956 --> 16:45.241
Don't worry,
the ICU will take good care of you.

16:45.459 --> 16:49.955
I know. They did last time
after my operation.

16:50.172 --> 16:53.089
You were here for an operation?
For what?

16:53.300 --> 16:56.716
Oh, dear, let me think.
What was it called, Ralph?

16:56.928 --> 17:00.379
Gee, I'm not sure.
It had to do with her stomach.

17:00.598 --> 17:04.299
Yes, that's it. They took
something out of my stomach.

17:04.519 --> 17:08.730
- Does that make a difference?
- No, but I just wanna make sure.

17:08.939 --> 17:11.608
- Come on. Here we go.
- Thank you.

17:11.817 --> 17:14.486
- Randi, I'll be in Medical Records.
- Okay.

17:15.404 --> 17:18.737
The infield fly rule is...

17:18.949 --> 17:22.448
...when the batter hits the ball...

17:22.618 --> 17:28.075
...and it goes way high up, you know,
like over the pitcher's mound...

17:29.709 --> 17:34.038
...the guy on 2nd must go to 3rd
before the guy on 1st can go.

17:34.213 --> 17:38.045
I thought they're not supposed
to run on a fly ball.

17:38.884 --> 17:40.592
It's complicated.

17:41.136 --> 17:45.513
You don't have any idea what
the infield fly rule is, do you?

17:45.682 --> 17:47.425
Can we go now?

17:48.810 --> 17:53.139
I mean, you may have
a new used car, but I don't.

17:53.648 --> 17:57.811
- My first vehicle was a tractor.
- A tractor?

17:57.985 --> 18:00.654
Yeah. My grandpa's farm.

18:00.821 --> 18:03.822
He let me drive
when I was about 11, 12.

18:03.990 --> 18:07.240
Till I took out some fences
and one of his cows.

18:07.410 --> 18:11.242
- Was your dad a farmer too?
- He was a train conductor.

18:11.789 --> 18:14.660
I'd ride on his lap
when I was little.

18:14.876 --> 18:19.454
Sometimes my brother and I would go
all the way to Zagreb with him.

18:19.672 --> 18:23.883
We'd run through the cars,
looking at the passengers, thinking:

18:24.092 --> 18:26.049
"My father drives the train."

18:26.261 --> 18:29.381
- You spent a lot of time with your dad?
- Yeah.

18:31.016 --> 18:35.179
Did you come here a lot with
your father? Learn about baseball?

18:35.353 --> 18:38.022
- Why? Because I know so much?
- Yeah.

18:38.189 --> 18:42.021
No, actually.
My dad died when I was really little.

18:42.193 --> 18:43.817
- I never knew him.
- I'm sorry.

18:43.986 --> 18:45.777
Yeah. So am I.

18:46.697 --> 18:49.863
Must make you think
about Kate and Tess...

18:50.075 --> 18:52.482
...about their knowing their father.

18:54.162 --> 18:59.369
Yeah, I guess. But you'd know what
they're missing more than I do.

19:01.335 --> 19:05.796
- We gonna buy a car or not?
- We're going to buy a car.

19:06.006 --> 19:10.134
I couldn't find Ruth Pooler's file.
It's probably in storage.

19:10.344 --> 19:12.217
- I can get it in an hour.
- Okay.

19:12.387 --> 19:16.634
I found that other one you wanted.
Paul Sobriki? Psych file.

19:17.016 --> 19:18.475
That's the one.

19:19.102 --> 19:20.133
Sign right here.

19:23.731 --> 19:25.309
All right.

19:41.706 --> 19:44.707
- Hey, Dr. Carter.
- Dr. DeRaad, hi.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.076
- How you doing?
- Good. Fine.

19:48.671 --> 19:51.375
Just going over an old chart.
Asthma patient.

19:51.548 --> 19:56.625
- Getting back into work okay?
- Pretty well. I have good and bad days.

19:56.845 --> 20:01.388
- Actually, today hasn't been that...
- Well...

20:01.599 --> 20:04.968
- ... come on up and we'll talk.
- No. I'm okay.

20:05.603 --> 20:08.141
I know. But I have time.

20:08.940 --> 20:11.265
Say, 3:00?

20:14.111 --> 20:15.938
Sure. Thanks.

20:21.493 --> 20:26.914
- That was a hell of a time.
- Sam did two tours, wanted a third.

20:27.081 --> 20:29.323
But I told him I'd kill him.
He heard me.

20:29.542 --> 20:32.496
- What are you doing?
- Talking to Mrs. MacKenzie.

20:32.712 --> 20:34.704
- Call me Sarah.
- Pulse ox, Dad.

20:34.922 --> 20:37.757
- Gotta leave it on.
- I didn't know it was off.

20:37.925 --> 20:41.376
Her husband's a Navy man too.
Served in Vietnam.

20:41.553 --> 20:44.589
- Although later than I did.
- Is that so?

20:45.140 --> 20:49.137
Still thinks he's Navy,
on the lake in his boat now.

20:49.310 --> 20:52.477
Says it keeps him sane.
Isn't this supposed to be dripping?

20:53.272 --> 20:56.890
- I understand what he means.
- Keep your elbow straight.

20:57.443 --> 21:00.397
I love being out on the water.

21:01.447 --> 21:04.613
Sometimes in the
middle of the night...

21:04.825 --> 21:06.864
...you get a storm.

21:07.035 --> 21:10.570
Thirty-foot waves coming
in different directions.

21:12.540 --> 21:16.324
Rocking and rolling
like you wouldn't believe.

21:17.503 --> 21:21.453
Still, it puts you to sleep
like a little baby.

21:23.676 --> 21:28.218
I'd wake up at dawn,
go out to the tip of the bow...

21:29.681 --> 21:32.219
...and the water
would be clear and calm.

21:34.644 --> 21:38.891
Ships slicing through it
like cool air.

21:40.608 --> 21:43.015
Calmest place on earth,
I used to think.

21:49.491 --> 21:51.780
Like the storm...

21:52.619 --> 21:54.861
...never even happened.

22:14.639 --> 22:16.596
- Hi. Jessamyn?
- Yes.

22:16.766 --> 22:18.593
- Jessamyn Chadsey?
- Yes.

22:18.768 --> 22:22.580
- Jessamyn, who is it?
- Hi. Mrs. Lomax?

22:22.648 --> 22:24.615
- Yes?
- Hi, my name is Abby Lockhart.

22:24.668 --> 22:26.474
I work at County General.

22:26.651 --> 22:30.862
It's something wrong? Did something
happen to Terry? Please, come in.

22:32.740 --> 22:35.195
No. No.

22:36.410 --> 22:40.028
I've been treating your former
husband's daughter.

22:40.205 --> 22:43.455
- Did he send you here?
- No. He didn't.

22:44.667 --> 22:49.163
- You know about her leukemia?
- Get out! Jessamyn, upstairs.

22:49.380 --> 22:52.381
- No. Mom, I want to stay.
- She's a child.

22:52.883 --> 22:56.003
- Our closest match is unrelated.
- Get out!

22:56.178 --> 22:59.843
If Jessamyn matched,
she'll more likely survive.

23:00.056 --> 23:02.630
I don't care about him
or anything to do with him!

23:02.851 --> 23:06.682
- Mom, calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

23:06.896 --> 23:11.107
- Please, leave.
- Mrs. Lomax, if you could just-

23:11.317 --> 23:14.401
I asked you to leave.
Do I need to call somebody?

23:17.197 --> 23:21.740
'97 Camry, power steering,
power brakes, power windows...

23:21.910 --> 23:27.248
...power locks, power seats,
and all for only $18,000?

23:27.415 --> 23:29.823
- That's outrageous!
- You're enjoying this.

23:30.043 --> 23:34.254
Now, here we go. Special deal.
Very low price.

23:34.422 --> 23:36.959
$3300.

23:37.925 --> 23:42.218
- What is it?
- It's a Dodge Dynasty. 1989.

23:42.387 --> 23:45.222
Good year. And only 90,000 miles.

23:45.432 --> 23:50.058
- It's a Dodge Dynasty.
- Okay, it's not your thing.

23:50.270 --> 23:53.638
How about a '91 Mercury Sable...

23:53.815 --> 23:57.433
...for $2900.
What more could you want?

23:57.610 --> 24:00.776
Four doors, windshield wipers,
antenna...

24:13.166 --> 24:15.324
- Hey, Malucci.
- Yeah, chief?

24:15.543 --> 24:16.871
Come here.

24:17.044 --> 24:21.172
Your little runaway
is hiding down the hall.

24:21.340 --> 24:24.045
- What's he doing?
- Spying on me.

24:24.260 --> 24:26.548
Get him back to Exam Two.

24:29.931 --> 24:34.474
We're treating her with antibiotics.
But her oxygen level is low.

24:35.145 --> 24:39.308
Pneumonia can be a peaceful way
for an elderly person to die.

24:39.524 --> 24:45.312
- We don't want her to die!
- She'll fall asleep, stop breathing.

24:45.488 --> 24:46.982
There's no pain or suffering.

24:47.156 --> 24:49.991
Can she put her
on a breathing machine?

24:50.200 --> 24:52.489
It may be best for nature
to take its course.

24:52.661 --> 24:55.994
Last month I saw her sit up and eat.

24:56.206 --> 24:59.409
She stopped eating a while ago
according to the nursing home.

24:59.584 --> 25:02.703
She's being fed through a tube now,
directly to her stomach.

25:03.296 --> 25:05.833
- We can't just let Grandma die.
- We won't.

25:07.591 --> 25:09.667
- If you need time-
- We don't need time!

25:10.260 --> 25:12.930
We need somebody to help us!
That's not you!

25:16.141 --> 25:18.264
Excuse me for a moment...

25:21.729 --> 25:24.600
- Have you seen Dr. Weaver?
- No.

25:34.992 --> 25:37.613
I keep having these thoughts.

25:37.786 --> 25:42.163
It's like I see moments of the accident.
Something reminds me.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.829
Accident? I'd call it an attack.

25:45.001 --> 25:48.370
A brutal attack for which
you had no warning.

25:48.963 --> 25:50.505
Right.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.544
Well, that's the thing.

25:53.759 --> 25:58.136
See, I assisted on the spinal tap
on Paul Sobriki.

25:58.305 --> 26:01.389
And he was aggressive.

26:01.600 --> 26:05.099
And he was overreacting.

26:05.270 --> 26:08.140
And he'd had Ativan.
And I numbed him with lidocaine.

26:08.356 --> 26:10.645
But his response was...

26:11.818 --> 26:13.442
...as if...

26:14.737 --> 26:16.196
...we were stabbing him.

26:16.780 --> 26:18.987
In his mental state,
he thought you were.

26:22.536 --> 26:25.869
I should've realized
something was very wrong.

26:26.831 --> 26:30.330
So should have Lucy,
but she didn't either, did she?

26:32.086 --> 26:34.209
There's always "what ifs."

26:34.380 --> 26:36.918
What if I did
the psych consult sooner?

26:37.758 --> 26:41.921
It'd be easy to see it as an accident.
But we can't.

26:42.137 --> 26:46.846
I know. I just want to get
these thoughts out of my head.

26:47.601 --> 26:49.889
It'll take some time.

26:52.856 --> 26:55.014
- Have you seen him?
- Paul Sobriki?

26:56.567 --> 26:59.687
Have you seen him or his wife?

27:00.613 --> 27:04.231
No. You're curious about
what's happening with them?

27:05.284 --> 27:08.071
No. No. I just...

27:11.206 --> 27:13.494
It's a 911. I gotta go.

27:14.375 --> 27:17.210
- Thank you.
- Anytime. Come back.

27:18.421 --> 27:20.164
It's been a pleasure.

27:20.381 --> 27:24.509
Come back. But you won't need to.
It'll last 10 years.

27:24.718 --> 27:26.794
My name is Manny.
Did you get a number?

27:27.012 --> 27:30.132
Oh, God, I hope I won't be driving
this car in 10 years.

27:30.349 --> 27:32.341
It's a beauty. Come on.

27:32.559 --> 27:36.888
It's a small station wagon.
But thanks for your help.

27:39.065 --> 27:40.808
Shall we celebrate?

27:43.778 --> 27:46.185
- Are you stealing?
- I'm borrowing.

27:46.405 --> 27:50.272
- I think he's stealing.
- Doctor, I need your help.

27:50.492 --> 27:53.778
- I'm not on.
- I know. I can't find Kerry.

27:53.996 --> 27:56.118
Dad, I'll be right back.

27:57.540 --> 28:00.114
- What is it?
- Syncope. Blunt head trauma.

28:00.293 --> 28:02.416
In the ICU with his wife, he fell.

28:02.629 --> 28:04.835
- You all right?
- Lateral C-spine and chest?

28:05.047 --> 28:09.424
- CBC, lytes, cardiac enzymes, EKG.
- Whoa, look out!

28:09.593 --> 28:12.380
Let's get a head CT.
Where's the blood from?

28:12.596 --> 28:15.250
Occipital scalp lac. No hemotympanum.

28:15.341 --> 28:17.334
Systolic's 95, pulse ox 98.

28:17.369 --> 28:21.311
Bolus 250 of saline. Ancef.
Update his tetanus.

28:21.521 --> 28:23.644
Here's the 12-lead from upstairs.

28:23.815 --> 28:27.100
No ST changes.
It's not a heart attack.

28:28.110 --> 28:31.277
She can't eat.
She has no quality of life.

28:32.364 --> 28:35.567
If we intubate her,
they'll take her to the ICU.

28:35.743 --> 28:39.787
Hook her up to tubes
and wires and machines.

28:39.955 --> 28:44.700
And she'll die in perhaps
two, three weeks.

28:45.210 --> 28:47.617
If we leave her as she is now...

28:48.254 --> 28:52.038
...she'll die today,
maybe tomorrow...

28:52.258 --> 28:53.882
...but peacefully.

28:55.511 --> 28:59.093
You need to think carefully
about her wants.

29:01.683 --> 29:03.972
Mr. Hemmings,
your mom's letting go.

29:06.980 --> 29:08.438
You think we should do that?

29:10.233 --> 29:12.309
You should spend
some time with her.

29:19.950 --> 29:22.441
- Thank you, Dr. Greene.
- Sure.

29:29.918 --> 29:33.002
Thanks. I'll tell you
what the head CT shows.

29:33.338 --> 29:35.828
- How's it going?
- All right. You?

29:36.007 --> 29:40.134
I'll pack up the old man
and take him for a spin.

29:40.302 --> 29:43.885
- His labs and films aren't back yet.
- Okay. I'll call the lab.

29:44.056 --> 29:45.550
- You call Radiology.
- Okay.

29:45.766 --> 29:47.474
- Oh, boy!
- What?

29:47.684 --> 29:50.934
Remember that leukemia case?
Hi, Jessamyn.

29:51.146 --> 29:53.019
- Are they here?
- This is Dr. Weaver.

29:53.189 --> 29:56.356
- Hi.
- They're waiting for a bed upstairs.

29:56.567 --> 30:00.232
I wanna do this. I want to help out
if I can. What do I have to do?

30:00.404 --> 30:01.780
Okay, well-

30:01.989 --> 30:05.322
- Did your mother drive you here?
- No, I drove myself.

30:06.201 --> 30:10.530
- Does she know you're here?
- I'm old enough to decide.

30:10.747 --> 30:14.958
When it comes to this subject,
there's no talking to Mom.

30:15.126 --> 30:19.704
- So she hasn't given consent?
- My dad wants this.

30:19.881 --> 30:22.751
I want this.
That has to count for something.

30:23.301 --> 30:25.589
It does. It counts for a lot.

30:25.803 --> 30:30.429
But the rules are very clear.
It's your mother's decision.

30:30.891 --> 30:33.382
She said she can't understand this.

30:33.560 --> 30:36.514
A life's at stake.
I can't either.

30:36.896 --> 30:41.891
I'm so sorry. Abby, let me know
when those labs are back.

30:43.069 --> 30:45.560
- Let's see your dad.
- I don't want to.

30:45.780 --> 30:48.152
He'll love that you want to do this.

30:48.365 --> 30:52.363
I don't care what he thinks.
I'm only helping Delia.

30:52.995 --> 30:55.948
Good eating today. Hot dog, hamburger.

30:56.039 --> 30:57.414
French fries?

30:58.750 --> 31:02.830
Thank you. I haven't been through
a drive-through for so long.

31:03.421 --> 31:07.798
Would've been a pity
to leave the car alone its first day.

31:08.634 --> 31:10.674
Yes, I agree.

31:11.303 --> 31:16.677
When I came to Chicago,
I came here a lot to look at the city.

31:16.850 --> 31:18.178
It's so beautiful.

31:20.312 --> 31:23.811
- You grow up in a city?
- No, by the coast.

31:28.236 --> 31:29.778
Were you there during the war?

31:32.156 --> 31:37.114
No. Then we were in Vukovar.

31:38.871 --> 31:42.654
A small apartment.
I didn't have much money.

31:45.543 --> 31:50.620
We kept the children in
all the time for safety.

31:53.092 --> 31:57.504
- They'd get crazy. What do you call it?
- Cabin fever.

32:01.016 --> 32:03.305
I was going to the market.

32:03.518 --> 32:06.603
Not for much.
Just for cheese and bread.

32:07.606 --> 32:10.642
And they were climbing all over me.

32:10.859 --> 32:13.693
"Please let me come. Let me come."

32:14.487 --> 32:19.445
The answer was the same as always.
"No, it's not safe."

32:21.452 --> 32:22.827
My wife stayed with them.

32:24.163 --> 32:27.780
- Luka.
- No, it's okay.

32:29.918 --> 32:33.334
I was just 50 meters away...

32:33.505 --> 32:35.627
...when I heard the whistle
in the air.

32:39.385 --> 32:42.220
Artillery shell hit the building.

32:52.564 --> 32:54.058
It's all redone now.

32:55.733 --> 32:58.307
People rebuilt all during the war.

32:58.486 --> 33:01.736
One day you're in a café,
the next day it's bombed.

33:01.906 --> 33:04.860
The next day, they're rebuilding.

33:08.162 --> 33:10.119
That's what you do.

33:10.330 --> 33:14.624
Something happens, you rebuild,
you go on.

33:21.382 --> 33:25.510
We should go.
Your mom will think you're joy riding.

33:43.236 --> 33:45.643
Hey, Randi, where is Dr. Malucci?

33:45.863 --> 33:48.864
- He was in Exam One a while ago.
- Thanks.

34:00.752 --> 34:02.495
Hey, Malu-

34:03.630 --> 34:07.923
- Dr. Weaver.
- Can I speak to you for a moment?

34:10.553 --> 34:13.257
I don't want to hear your reasons
or justifications.

34:13.429 --> 34:15.755
- Did you know I could fail you for that?
- Yes.

34:15.933 --> 34:18.139
- What are you-?
- I wanted to help.

34:18.351 --> 34:21.851
Her coming here was brave.
What you did is stupid.

34:22.022 --> 34:26.315
Her sister will be in chemo
two months before the transplant.

34:26.484 --> 34:28.975
- The mother will know.
- She wanted to try.

34:29.152 --> 34:32.603
It's our sometimes lousy job
to say no.

34:32.822 --> 34:37.034
There are rules this department
must and will follow. Clear?

34:37.202 --> 34:38.697
Yes.

34:39.496 --> 34:41.784
Make sure she can drive home.

34:43.125 --> 34:45.246
Dr. Weaver.

34:45.877 --> 34:48.034
I don't think trying to help
is ever stupid.

34:53.342 --> 34:56.509
- I'm really sorry.
- Hope I didn't get you in trouble.

34:56.721 --> 35:00.884
I'll live. While you're here,
why not see your dad?

35:01.100 --> 35:05.892
- No, I'm gonna leave.
- I really wish you wouldn't.

35:07.564 --> 35:11.431
Dr. Weaver,
I'm having trouble with an HMO.

35:11.609 --> 35:15.025
A 76-year-old guy. They want to
transfer him, we should keep him here.

35:15.238 --> 35:18.191
- Any EKG changes or ectopy?
- No.

35:18.366 --> 35:19.943
- What insurance?
- Blue Beacon.

35:20.159 --> 35:22.994
We transfer their stable patients.

35:23.203 --> 35:26.240
It's complicated.
His wife's in the ICU.

35:26.456 --> 35:29.161
- They won't authorize it.
- It's best if they're together.

35:29.334 --> 35:30.662
They won't authorize it.

35:30.835 --> 35:33.540
He can't be transferred.
He's dehydrated.

35:33.755 --> 35:35.961
- Rehydrate him.
- He's hypokalemic.

35:36.174 --> 35:38.000
- Replete his potassium.
- He's anemic.

35:38.217 --> 35:39.546
- Actively bleeding?
- No.

35:39.719 --> 35:41.296
It's chronic. He can go.

35:41.512 --> 35:45.759
- He wants to stay with his wife.
- Does he want a $2000 hospital bill?

35:45.933 --> 35:49.467
All right, well, I'm leaving. I don't know
if I can oversee the transfer.

35:49.645 --> 35:51.436
Then I'll do it.

35:52.230 --> 35:56.975
They were filming a Swedish movie
near my grandpa's farm.

35:57.193 --> 35:58.474
They needed animals.

35:58.820 --> 36:01.026
So you just rented out cows and chickens?

36:01.197 --> 36:06.155
Sheep and horses too. My brother and I.
We made a lot of money for teenagers.

36:06.368 --> 36:08.491
But it was a huge mess-

36:08.704 --> 36:13.033
- Luka? What's happening?
- I don't believe this. I'm gonna kill Herb!

36:13.250 --> 36:15.207
We didn't meet Herb!

36:15.418 --> 36:19.036
This happened when I bought mine.
Herb said it was a fluke.

36:19.214 --> 36:23.258
- You're telling me this now?
- I can fix it.

36:37.481 --> 36:40.565
So you brought me to the water.

36:42.569 --> 36:45.024
Good boy. Good boy.

36:48.074 --> 36:49.947
It's funny, Mark.

36:50.868 --> 36:54.948
You know some years seem to pass
faster than others?

36:55.122 --> 36:58.704
- Yeah.
- This year's been the fastest.

37:01.044 --> 37:04.377
I was thinking how strange
things can be.

37:06.257 --> 37:07.835
You know...

37:08.217 --> 37:11.218
...in all the wars I served in...

37:12.847 --> 37:15.966
...I never watched a man die?

37:16.976 --> 37:19.645
On some ships you get lucky.

37:21.772 --> 37:24.476
But I must have told you
about that time...

37:24.649 --> 37:28.065
...we had an explosion
at the base motor pool.

37:28.278 --> 37:31.113
- When you were stationed in Guam?
- Yes.

37:31.614 --> 37:35.742
I was little.
Mom and I were at San Diego.

37:36.035 --> 37:38.526
You called and told Mom about it
over the phone.

37:38.996 --> 37:41.238
We lost seven men.

37:41.790 --> 37:45.325
I was in the Exchange
when it happened.

37:45.544 --> 37:49.956
I was looking for some shaving cream
or something.

37:50.465 --> 37:53.631
Everybody scrambled out.

37:54.135 --> 37:59.046
I started to, me and a lieutenant
in the aisle next to me.

37:59.306 --> 38:03.304
The shampoo section, as I recall.

38:03.852 --> 38:07.102
The next thing I know,
I hear a crash.

38:08.482 --> 38:13.642
I turn and all these bottles
had come flying off the shelf.

38:13.820 --> 38:17.948
And this poor son of a bitch
is collapsing on the floor.

38:18.115 --> 38:20.155
He had a heart attack.

38:20.326 --> 38:23.742
- What'd you do?
- I screamed for help.

38:23.913 --> 38:27.412
No one came.
They were all at the motor pool.

38:28.959 --> 38:30.750
I got down.

38:31.878 --> 38:35.579
I loosened his tie
and unbuttoned his collar.

38:37.050 --> 38:39.671
He grabbed onto my hand...

38:40.720 --> 38:43.175
...begged me not to leave him.

38:44.557 --> 38:46.051
So I stayed.

38:48.102 --> 38:52.016
And I pulled him into my arms
and I held him.

38:53.482 --> 38:55.557
Just the two of us.

38:56.985 --> 39:00.685
For the next four minutes
I watched him die.

39:02.115 --> 39:04.866
The longest four minutes of my life.

39:07.870 --> 39:10.195
But in a crazy way...

39:11.665 --> 39:14.998
...four of the best minutes
of my life.

39:18.630 --> 39:23.042
There was some kind of value
in just being there.

39:26.387 --> 39:28.545
Thank you, Mark...

39:32.768 --> 39:36.552
...for bringing me out to the water.

39:40.442 --> 39:42.399
You're welcome, Dad.

39:47.448 --> 39:50.698
- Sam?
- Dr. Greene?

39:50.868 --> 39:54.367
Sam, I'd like you to meet my dad,
David Greene.

39:54.580 --> 39:57.664
Dad, Sam MacKenzie.
Sarah's husband.

39:58.041 --> 40:01.078
- How do you do, sir?
- What the hell?

40:04.631 --> 40:07.335
Dr. Carter tried to keep me here.

40:07.509 --> 40:11.720
It's tough with HMOs.
New Western will take good care of you.

40:11.888 --> 40:16.514
Could you tell my wife
I'll call as soon as I'm settled?

40:16.725 --> 40:19.014
There's no patient phones in ICU.

40:19.186 --> 40:22.685
But you can call the main number
to ask how she is.

40:22.856 --> 40:27.897
Good. Thanks again for everything.
My wife and I appreciate it.

40:28.069 --> 40:29.184
You're welcome, sir.

40:41.290 --> 40:43.117
How's Paul doing?

40:44.293 --> 40:49.250
He's at Chester.
I guess that's the main place for Illinois.

40:50.757 --> 40:52.999
They put him on medication.

40:55.053 --> 40:57.887
What did you want to talk about?

40:58.097 --> 41:01.632
I don't know. I just keep
thinking about what happened...

41:01.851 --> 41:03.890
You're not the only one.

41:04.561 --> 41:06.684
Sometimes my thoughts...

41:06.897 --> 41:10.431
...seem as loud as the voices
Paul hears.

41:11.026 --> 41:14.560
I lived with him, I slept with him.

41:14.737 --> 41:17.063
I'm about to bear his child.

41:18.241 --> 41:20.150
How could I not see it?

41:20.993 --> 41:22.820
I don't know.

41:27.041 --> 41:31.038
- Keep trying!
- I am trying. It's not starting.

41:31.253 --> 41:36.045
- Keep trying. It'll start.
- "Keep trying. It'll start."

41:36.591 --> 41:38.880
- It'll start.
- It's not starting.

41:47.726 --> 41:51.060
It's been an otherwise
really nice day.

42:26.095 --> 42:30.342
- Thank you for calling.
- I'm sorry about all this.

42:30.558 --> 42:31.933
Where are they?

42:32.143 --> 42:36.638
Your ex is in the cafeteria.
I'll take you to Jessamyn.

42:55.039 --> 42:57.956
Everybody wants this, Mrs. Lomax.

43:31.156 --> 43:32.484
A lemonade stand?

43:32.657 --> 43:37.402
Yeah. Me and my friends would set up
a card table with a sign that says:

43:37.578 --> 43:42.121
"Lemonade, 10 cents a glass."
Not as lucrative as the cow trade.

43:42.791 --> 43:44.831
We rode high if we made $1.50.

43:45.586 --> 43:49.453
- But less cleanup than the cow trade.
- True.

43:49.673 --> 43:51.749
I look forward to that
with Kate and Tess...

43:51.925 --> 43:54.629
...when that'll be
a very important thing.

43:54.802 --> 43:58.847
Wondering if they used enough sugar
and when a car will drive by.

43:59.557 --> 44:00.968
Yeah.

44:04.603 --> 44:06.512
I expected the tow truck by now.

44:07.606 --> 44:11.555
Yeah. But then nothing has gone
as expected today.
