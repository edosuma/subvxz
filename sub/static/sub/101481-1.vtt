WEBVTT

06:54.112 --> 06:55.081
Eh, buddy!

08:18.230 --> 08:19.232
So
that's all, then?

08:21.266 --> 08:22.635
Just-

08:22.668 --> 08:23.536
found him
laying there, eh?

08:24.201 --> 08:24.870
Yeah.

08:33.678 --> 08:35.212
Did you know this
guy before-Keith?

08:36.280 --> 08:37.149
No, Sir.

08:40.652 --> 08:41.120
Well-

08:42.354 --> 08:44.824
Nerves can do queer things to
people sometimes, you know?

08:45.524 --> 08:47.125
Make you do all
kinds of things you-

08:48.860 --> 08:50.129
never thought
you'd ever do.

10:18.817 --> 10:20.653
Hey,
what are you at?

10:21.687 --> 10:22.153
Yeah, best kind.

10:24.855 --> 10:25.289
Yeah, right on.

10:25.322 --> 10:26.824
Listen.

10:26.857 --> 10:27.892
I'll ask you a
question, now.

10:32.230 --> 10:33.065
No no.

10:33.097 --> 10:33.765
Never mind.

10:34.899 --> 10:35.768
Uh, listen.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.304
You coming to town
day after tomorrow?

10:41.005 --> 10:41.673
Yeah.

10:43.107 --> 10:43.908
Oh yeah, that
works, yeah.

10:46.010 --> 10:46.577
Right on.

10:46.611 --> 10:47.413
Oh yeah,
bring the mail?

10:50.014 --> 10:50.682
Alright.

13:51.562 --> 13:52.398
Can I help you?

13:55.966 --> 13:56.434
Uh-

13:58.202 --> 13:59.971
What were you
doing at my door?

14:00.004 --> 14:01.105
I'm sorry.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.108
For what?

14:03.841 --> 14:05.276
I'm sorry for
bothering you.

14:11.383 --> 14:12.283
You're not
bothering me, yet.

14:15.953 --> 14:17.288
You also haven't said
what you're looking for.

14:23.461 --> 14:24.430
It's just about Keith.

14:26.163 --> 14:26.865
You're a little late.

14:26.898 --> 14:27.966
They found him
dead last week.

14:39.110 --> 14:40.111
What did you say
your name was?

14:41.980 --> 14:42.648
Scott Rose.

14:45.649 --> 14:46.317
Well, Scott.

14:47.184 --> 14:47.951
If you remember
what you're looking for-

14:47.985 --> 14:49.355
you come back
and take it, huh?

14:51.623 --> 14:53.092
Just stay the fuck
away from my house.

14:58.096 --> 15:00.198
My cousin got that big
scrap yard there off Union.

15:03.701 --> 15:05.270
In case you ever needed
a hand with anything.

15:08.072 --> 15:09.375
What would I
need a hand with?

16:44.668 --> 16:45.571
There's a stranger!

16:47.438 --> 16:48.307
What are
you at, then?

16:48.706 --> 16:49.541
Nothing.

16:49.573 --> 16:50.442
I just got out.

16:50.475 --> 16:51.176
Either thing?

16:52.409 --> 16:53.312
Nothing all week.

16:54.245 --> 16:57.048
Took me all God-damn day
to get my new spot set up.

16:58.716 --> 16:59.717
I can't think
straight, b'y.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.452
It's like-

17:01.485 --> 17:03.054
like my brain is
floating around.

17:08.159 --> 17:09.094
That's it, then?

17:12.230 --> 17:12.698
What?

17:15.232 --> 17:17.101
I was over to
Reynold's yesterday.

17:19.237 --> 17:21.272
He told me you were the one
that found buddy in the woods?

17:23.272 --> 17:24.142
What?

17:24.643 --> 17:26.077
I found buddy
in the woods.

17:26.111 --> 17:27.079
That's it.

17:27.112 --> 17:29.114
Why didn't you tell me
that when you called?

17:29.146 --> 17:29.814
I don't know.

17:30.214 --> 17:30.881
Didn't come
to me mind.

17:30.915 --> 17:32.082
Never come
to your mind?

17:32.116 --> 17:34.286
to tell that you hauled a
dead fellow out of the river?

17:37.555 --> 17:38.423
He wasn't
in the river.

17:40.157 --> 17:40.692
Sook.

17:42.861 --> 17:44.296
I suppose everyone
knows now?

17:50.567 --> 17:51.235
Here.

17:54.672 --> 17:55.339
Thanks.

18:05.650 --> 18:06.852
Did you want to
know about him?

18:07.051 --> 18:08.119
Who?

18:09.153 --> 18:10.189
Well, I wasn't
there at the time.

18:10.221 --> 18:12.223
But Craig said this fellow
came by the yard twice

18:12.257 --> 18:14.392
trying to low-ball him
on some old beater.

18:14.424 --> 18:15.225
Right?

18:15.259 --> 18:16.027
Yeah, well fuck all
Craig would get

18:16.059 --> 18:17.361
haggling over
the likes of that.

18:17.394 --> 18:18.430
So buddy went on.

18:20.230 --> 18:21.566
How do you know it
was the same fellow?

18:21.598 --> 18:23.167
You don't know
who Keith is?

18:23.201 --> 18:23.669
No.

18:24.469 --> 18:25.336
Tangled up in
gangs or whatever.

18:26.403 --> 18:27.271
Foolishness.

18:27.838 --> 18:29.107
Yeah, good
riddance, then.

18:29.673 --> 18:30.341
Yeah.

18:37.214 --> 18:38.250
I went up
to his house.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.152
What?

18:41.219 --> 18:42.653
I didn't know
what to be at, b'y.

18:43.621 --> 18:44.823
I felt responsible.

18:45.355 --> 18:47.625
I think someone was
fucking with my traps.

18:49.193 --> 18:49.661
Shit.

18:49.861 --> 18:50.528
Yeah.

18:51.596 --> 18:53.230
Some missus up there.

18:53.263 --> 18:54.298
She told me
to fuck off.

18:55.266 --> 18:56.668
Yeah, I seen
her around.

18:56.701 --> 18:57.568
Hanging off of him.

19:00.270 --> 19:00.739
She's knocked up.

19:02.406 --> 19:03.240
If buddy's scrounging-

19:03.273 --> 19:05.242
he's in a
tender spot.

19:05.276 --> 19:07.679
And you're best not to get
fucked up with all that.

20:47.444 --> 20:49.681
I'd say I been pretty
patient up to this point.

20:49.713 --> 20:51.316
Yes, I'd say so.

20:54.018 --> 20:54.685
It's all right.

20:54.719 --> 20:55.854
Just give us a
few minutes.

21:02.426 --> 21:04.561
And now you want
me to try and find

21:04.595 --> 21:06.731
the kind of patience that I'm
not even sure I fucking got.

21:11.402 --> 21:12.370
And he's the one

21:12.403 --> 21:15.606
you're going to
have to ask next

21:15.640 --> 21:16.541
for some patience.

21:23.815 --> 21:25.083
I understand, Cotton.

21:25.115 --> 21:25.783
I do.

21:28.051 --> 21:29.288
I know you do.

21:31.556 --> 21:33.024
And I'm not trying
to be unreasonable.

21:33.057 --> 21:34.425
I know.

21:34.459 --> 21:37.663
I'm just in a really
tender spot, here.

21:40.464 --> 21:41.799
I've got a bit of
cash in the truck.

21:41.833 --> 21:43.035
But that's it.

21:46.503 --> 21:47.671
Go down and wait.

21:47.704 --> 21:49.307
And I'll send someone
down to get it.

22:43.094 --> 22:44.596
He's got some
money for me.

22:47.498 --> 22:48.834
I want you
to get it.

22:51.102 --> 22:52.704
And then take him
up to the barrens.

26:57.948 --> 26:58.750
Excuse me.

26:58.782 --> 26:59.250
Hello.

27:06.089 --> 27:06.757
What-?

27:10.394 --> 27:11.162
What's your problem, man?

27:11.194 --> 27:12.029
Move.

27:12.063 --> 27:14.132
Is Keith around
or what?

27:16.067 --> 27:16.901
No.

27:17.768 --> 27:19.069
You're lying.

27:19.103 --> 27:20.404
I'm not. He's gone.

27:23.140 --> 27:23.975
Is this a joke?

27:25.041 --> 27:25.909
Get out of
my way.

27:27.411 --> 27:28.246
Tell me
where he is.

27:28.278 --> 27:28.946
And I'll go.

27:29.880 --> 27:30.782
He's dead.

27:33.284 --> 27:34.986
Quit shagging around.

27:43.326 --> 27:43.994
Look at me.

27:46.896 --> 27:48.098
I don't owe
you anything.

27:49.365 --> 27:50.434
If he's gone,
you might.

27:52.169 --> 27:53.905
I'll get loud.

28:50.394 --> 28:51.261
Ah, hey.
It's Mona.

28:52.797 --> 28:53.364
Um.

28:56.166 --> 28:58.301
I don't know if you're still
screening my calls or not.

28:58.335 --> 28:59.871
But I-

28:59.903 --> 29:03.141
I would
like to talk.

29:03.173 --> 29:04.041
If you'd like to.

29:06.544 --> 29:07.211
Um-

29:08.846 --> 29:10.315
I've been in one
place for a while-

29:13.083 --> 29:14.853
for a change, so-

29:52.288 --> 29:53.458
You're going to
be a grandmother.

29:58.061 --> 29:59.062
Okay, bye.

30:09.105 --> 30:09.973
Listen.

30:10.773 --> 30:12.008
I just got the call
about Keith-

30:12.041 --> 30:13.144
saying he's dead.

30:15.179 --> 30:16.214
Don't worry about
the package.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.116
Just get the fuck
over here.

30:22.019 --> 30:23.554
The fucker
fell off a bank.

30:23.586 --> 30:24.254
And struck his head.

30:24.288 --> 30:25.923
What do you
want me to say?

30:35.231 --> 30:36.233
Ask around!

30:37.268 --> 30:38.135
That's it!

30:39.903 --> 30:41.038
Now, stay
the fuck put!

30:41.939 --> 30:42.941
And give me
some time!

31:37.126 --> 31:38.096
Go to bed
out of it!

31:43.467 --> 31:44.502
Super!

31:44.835 --> 31:45.702
Thank you!

31:45.736 --> 31:47.004
What happened?

31:47.037 --> 31:47.671
I don't know.

31:47.704 --> 31:48.771
I got out
of the truck.

31:48.806 --> 31:50.642
And the leaf spring was
split right down the middle.

31:51.642 --> 31:52.375
It was all-

31:52.409 --> 31:54.111
swung out like.

31:54.144 --> 31:55.113
Good thing it
didn't swing in.

31:57.146 --> 31:57.615
Yeah.

32:00.384 --> 32:01.419
Ah, I got to
get going.

32:06.390 --> 32:08.626
Your lady came
by the yard.

32:09.625 --> 32:10.295
What?

32:11.327 --> 32:11.995
Keith's woman.

32:12.930 --> 32:14.231
She was just stood
there when I come out.

32:17.034 --> 32:17.969
Oh yeah?

32:18.001 --> 32:18.568
What did she want?

37:26.742 --> 37:27.411
Hey!

37:30.313 --> 37:31.481
What is your problem?

37:34.418 --> 37:34.986
It's getting cold out!

38:15.525 --> 38:16.394
Milk? Sugar?

38:16.793 --> 38:17.494
I can get it.

38:17.695 --> 38:18.496
I'm not crippled.

38:42.418 --> 38:44.788
You got no one
around here?

38:51.027 --> 38:52.730
I've got some family
on the mainland.

38:52.762 --> 38:53.998
Not exactly close-knit.

38:58.601 --> 38:59.502
What about Keith's crowd?

39:02.972 --> 39:03.873
Not really.

39:17.853 --> 39:19.056
You didn't know Keith
too well, did you?

39:29.833 --> 39:30.800
I'm tired.

39:45.782 --> 39:46.817
Where did you
get the wood?

39:48.684 --> 39:49.519
Took some of mine.

39:49.853 --> 39:50.854
I only lives
up there.

39:50.887 --> 39:51.756
Across the river.

39:58.695 --> 39:59.530
Thank you.

40:01.030 --> 40:01.865
Thank <i> you</i>.

42:34.851 --> 42:35.619
Come on!

42:41.157 --> 42:42.626
I can smell the wood
burning out here!

42:46.163 --> 42:47.097
What are you?

42:47.130 --> 42:48.364
In the tub and can't
hear me or something?

42:48.398 --> 42:49.032
Open the door!

42:49.065 --> 42:50.967
I can fucking
hear you!

42:51.001 --> 42:51.935
I don't got
nothing for you!

42:51.967 --> 42:52.969
So go the
fuck away!

42:53.436 --> 42:54.871
Just checking on Keith.

42:55.938 --> 42:56.373
He's dead!

42:56.405 --> 42:57.007
Fuck off!

42:57.039 --> 42:58.007
Or I'll call
the cops!

42:59.943 --> 43:01.045
No you won't.

43:10.152 --> 43:11.221
What are you
doing out here?

43:12.889 --> 43:13.724
Go home, buddy.

43:14.257 --> 43:15.793
This don't concern you.

43:18.728 --> 43:19.896
Mona, is everything alright?

43:24.833 --> 43:25.301
No!

43:26.302 --> 43:27.338
Fuck sakes!

43:28.005 --> 43:29.239
Just get the fuck
out of here!

43:36.112 --> 43:39.115
I'll fucking
eat you whole.

43:39.516 --> 43:40.718
Okay, you fucker.

43:41.784 --> 43:42.385
Ugh!

43:45.155 --> 43:45.823
Ugh!

43:46.023 --> 43:46.724
Ugh!

43:47.157 --> 43:48.057
Ugh!

43:49.159 --> 43:49.992
Ugh!

48:26.635 --> 48:30.072
I don't want to have
to come find you

48:30.106 --> 48:32.342
every fucking time.

48:47.155 --> 48:47.924
For a minute.

48:51.360 --> 48:52.028
Cotton.

48:53.128 --> 48:53.931
What are you doing?

48:56.699 --> 48:57.367
What?

49:02.137 --> 49:04.007
Keith had something fucking
big hanging over them.

49:05.173 --> 49:06.208
I don't know

49:06.242 --> 49:08.178
where that stands now
that he's fucking buried.

49:08.210 --> 49:08.978
Yours?

49:10.313 --> 49:11.315
The Frenchman's.

49:13.115 --> 49:14.684
I stuck my fucking
neck out for it though.

49:20.155 --> 49:21.157
What about his missus?

49:21.190 --> 49:23.059
Now she has some
new fellow there-

49:23.092 --> 49:24.193
acting like a cowboy.

49:26.661 --> 49:27.364
Were the cops there?

49:28.563 --> 49:29.231
No.

49:32.068 --> 49:33.270
And they've got
something to hide.

49:34.804 --> 49:35.472
Oh, I can't.

49:35.505 --> 49:36.539
The wife will
have a fit.

49:36.572 --> 49:39.009
Ask her if she'd rather be
on fucking welfare then!

49:43.211 --> 49:44.213
You're going
back out there.

49:45.414 --> 49:47.451
And you're going to see what
the fucking cowboy's saying.

49:48.184 --> 49:49.052
Okay.

49:49.818 --> 49:50.686
And go alone.

49:52.121 --> 49:53.456
Don't bring that
fucking nuisance!

50:17.679 --> 50:19.114
You got a
real talent

50:19.148 --> 50:20.384
for fucking shit
up, don't you?

50:45.273 --> 50:46.275
Taking off early?

50:47.210 --> 50:48.744
Uh-youngster's waiting.

50:51.847 --> 50:52.516
Okay.

50:55.485 --> 50:56.153
Alright, then.

50:59.521 --> 51:00.489
I'm going
to kill him.

51:10.900 --> 51:12.102
That fellow.

51:12.869 --> 51:13.537
Her.

51:15.338 --> 51:16.840
I'm going to put
them in the ground.

51:21.309 --> 51:22.078
No, you're not.

51:22.612 --> 51:24.314
It wasn't a question.

51:26.148 --> 51:27.483
You're going to
have to try real hard

51:27.516 --> 51:29.652
not to tear a fucking
hole in this thing.

51:30.920 --> 51:32.856
You were
in Fort Mac.

51:33.456 --> 51:35.125
15 years.

51:35.157 --> 51:36.391
Boiler maker.

51:36.425 --> 51:38.528
I was up in
the Territories.

51:39.695 --> 51:41.131
Fucking miserable.

51:44.500 --> 51:45.568
I ended up
with fuck all.

51:49.438 --> 51:51.108
Well, that sums
us up, doesn't it?

51:51.806 --> 51:53.342
Sacrificing ourselves

51:53.376 --> 51:55.245
for people who think
we're disposable?

51:55.644 --> 51:58.114
Yeah, a lot of guys
get crushed out there.

51:58.347 --> 52:00.282
I met Keith

52:00.315 --> 52:01.784
when I lost the family,
and came back.

52:02.918 --> 52:04.153
And he
set me up.

52:11.226 --> 52:13.663
Now, his body's
not even cold.

52:13.695 --> 52:15.431
And some fellow's
lying in his bed?

52:18.501 --> 52:19.870
I'm going to gun
them down.

52:21.369 --> 52:22.271
Both of them.

52:28.643 --> 52:29.745
Hey!

52:29.778 --> 52:30.413
Hey hey hey!

52:30.445 --> 52:31.413
Coyote hey!

52:31.447 --> 52:33.249
Get the fuck out
of that truck!

52:33.282 --> 52:34.550
Look, I'm sick
and tired of you

52:34.583 --> 52:36.185
dragging me into
your fucking bullshit!

52:36.219 --> 52:37.353
Ohhh!

52:37.385 --> 52:37.920
Ughh!

52:40.889 --> 52:42.458
What the fuck?

52:42.992 --> 52:43.660
Uhh!

52:45.795 --> 52:46.463
Ughh!

52:54.603 --> 52:55.371
Ughh!

53:01.777 --> 53:02.445
Ughhh!

53:04.947 --> 53:05.749
Ugh!!

54:14.983 --> 54:16.819
I was just going
to come get you.

54:17.619 --> 54:18.221
Yeah, I know.

54:18.253 --> 54:19.322
I just saw
you pull up.

54:20.021 --> 54:20.889
Nice.

54:22.557 --> 54:23.393
Hold on.

54:31.599 --> 54:33.001
A bit of a
rough week.

54:33.034 --> 54:34.002
Yeah, no shit.

54:34.036 --> 54:34.936
No.

54:34.969 --> 54:35.938
Cops came by
about you.

54:36.940 --> 54:39.041
That piece of shit you
hauled out of the woods-

54:39.074 --> 54:39.975
they're trying
to figure out

54:40.010 --> 54:41.711
whether you and he
had any prior run-ins.

54:41.744 --> 54:42.711
Fighting or whatever.

54:43.079 --> 54:43.913
Ah, fuck.

54:46.715 --> 54:48.652
Probably doesn't help you
fucking his woman, either!

54:49.219 --> 54:50.653
I'm just
helping her out.

54:50.686 --> 54:51.421
She needs it.

54:52.454 --> 54:53.789
She don't need you.

54:53.822 --> 54:54.891
Not like you
wants her to.

54:55.557 --> 54:56.992
She's in a bit
of trouble, b'y.

54:57.025 --> 54:57.693
Yeah.

54:57.726 --> 54:58.694
She brought
that on herself.

54:58.728 --> 55:00.596
Now it's going to start
looking more and more

55:00.628 --> 55:01.831
like there's a reason
you're the one

55:01.864 --> 55:03.432
that pulled him up
out of the river.

55:10.606 --> 55:12.409
I'm thinking about
taking off for a while.

55:13.541 --> 55:14.009
Where?

55:14.376 --> 55:15.844
I don't know.

55:15.878 --> 55:17.080
I just feels
it coming.

55:21.851 --> 55:23.753
I'm going to leave the
keys to the house with you.

55:23.786 --> 55:25.755
I don't need your
father's cabin.

55:25.788 --> 55:26.956
Someone got
to watch it!

55:26.989 --> 55:28.858
Listen, if you think
you're responsible-

55:28.891 --> 55:30.093
like this is something
you got to do-

55:31.693 --> 55:32.628
you're not helping her.

55:33.195 --> 55:34.029
You're helping yourself.

55:34.063 --> 55:35.498
And it's fucking foolish.

55:37.532 --> 55:38.999
Thanks.

56:38.726 --> 56:40.195
Morning.

56:40.228 --> 56:41.129
Thanks for the ride.

56:41.163 --> 56:41.697
That's alright.

56:41.730 --> 56:42.398
I was heading downtown.

56:42.431 --> 56:43.264
I had to do
a few things.

56:45.134 --> 56:45.902
You in a hurry?

56:49.938 --> 56:50.906
Just wait right there.

56:50.940 --> 56:51.773
I'll be right back.

58:11.954 --> 58:13.122
Fuck fuck.

58:16.891 --> 58:17.860
Fuck.

59:26.027 --> 59:27.629
Uh-

59:27.663 --> 59:32.034
The other night-
those guys-

59:32.067 --> 59:32.969
They all knew Keith.

59:34.369 --> 59:35.337
They were friends.

59:44.713 --> 59:46.082
Do you want to
come in for a bit?

59:50.085 --> 59:51.320
Ah, not like that.

59:55.858 --> 59:58.861
It's just nice to have another
heartbeat around sometimes.

59:59.094 --> 59:59.963
You know?

01:00:00.228 --> 01:00:00.896
Yeah.

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:30.987
I thought I
heard you.

01:01:31.519 --> 01:01:32.288
I woke you.

01:01:35.056 --> 01:01:35.957
No.

01:01:37.992 --> 01:01:39.061
What were you
doing in there?

01:01:41.797 --> 01:01:42.264
Restless.

01:01:45.199 --> 01:01:47.035
Yeah, but what were
you doing in there?

01:01:48.269 --> 01:01:49.938
Nothing, just-

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:50.440
just looking.

01:01:53.007 --> 01:01:53.875
What were you
looking for?

01:01:58.347 --> 01:01:59.382
I was just
being nosy.

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:02.117
Sorry.

01:02:04.152 --> 01:02:05.487
Stop being so
damn sorry.

01:02:16.231 --> 01:02:17.433
Don't go looking
through my shit.

01:02:20.302 --> 01:02:21.237
I hate that.

01:02:37.552 --> 01:02:38.820
It's all Keith's
stuff anyways.

01:02:42.958 --> 01:02:43.826
I'll donate it.

01:02:51.532 --> 01:02:52.268
Or not.

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:52.934
I don't know.

01:02:53.735 --> 01:02:55.938
I don't think we
should stay here.

01:02:58.974 --> 01:02:59.842
We.

01:03:01.443 --> 01:03:02.111
You.

01:03:05.112 --> 01:03:06.848
They've got no
reason to come back.

01:03:10.117 --> 01:03:12.954
Sometimes when
I'm in the woods-

01:03:14.389 --> 01:03:15.825
I feel like I'm
being followed.

01:03:18.226 --> 01:03:19.127
I circle back.

01:03:21.128 --> 01:03:22.097
And there's
tracks there.

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:25.535
Something was following me.

01:03:29.371 --> 01:03:32.008
I'm not saying you don't know
how to take care of yourself.

01:03:36.545 --> 01:03:37.546
Do you feel
that way now?

01:03:37.579 --> 01:03:38.847
Like you're being followed?

01:03:47.322 --> 01:03:49.090
You know, I'm
not your problem.

01:03:49.123 --> 01:03:50.525
I just want
to help.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.569
I can take care
of myself.

01:04:04.606 --> 01:04:06.008
Something's been
eating at me.

01:04:09.543 --> 01:04:10.413
Yeah?

01:04:13.282 --> 01:04:14.016
Well, spit it out.

01:04:15.317 --> 01:04:17.019
I found Keith
in the river.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:26.428
You found him?

01:04:27.362 --> 01:04:28.431
I lives up
that way.

01:04:32.333 --> 01:04:33.168
I was out working.

01:04:37.072 --> 01:04:38.106
I just found him.

01:04:39.641 --> 01:04:40.208
I don't understand.

01:04:40.242 --> 01:04:40.943
You went
looking for him?

01:04:40.976 --> 01:04:42.411
Or you knew he
was up there?

01:04:45.579 --> 01:04:46.248
Hey.

01:04:49.184 --> 01:04:49.652
Look at me.

01:04:50.952 --> 01:04:51.420
Look at me.

01:04:52.119 --> 01:04:52.621
You lied to me.

01:04:54.588 --> 01:04:56.057
I felt responsible.

01:04:57.693 --> 01:04:59.095
I don't know why
I came up here.

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:01.195
I don't know what
I was looking for.

01:05:01.228 --> 01:05:03.031
It doesn't explain
why you lied to me.

01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:04.400
I wasn't just about
to walk up here

01:05:04.432 --> 01:05:06.367
and knock on your
door and tell you

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.303
I found him in the river
with his head smashed open.

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:15.177
What was he
doing there, eh?

01:05:17.244 --> 01:05:19.013
Was he trying to
steal my animals?

01:05:19.047 --> 01:05:19.715
Get the bounty?

01:05:19.748 --> 01:05:20.615
What're you
trying to do?

01:05:20.648 --> 01:05:21.317
Hm?

01:05:22.583 --> 01:05:23.286
Nothing!

01:05:27.088 --> 01:05:28.490
Keith wasn't trying
to steal your shit.

01:05:29.123 --> 01:05:30.591
Okay, he had people
looking for him.

01:05:30.625 --> 01:05:32.128
I hadn't seen him
in a fucking week.

01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:43.172
You pity me.

01:05:43.771 --> 01:05:44.673
You pity me.

01:05:49.143 --> 01:05:50.011
Right?

01:05:52.047 --> 01:05:53.081
I've wanted to
take care of you

01:05:53.114 --> 01:05:54.983
from the moment
I first saw you.

01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:14.135
Wanted to?

01:06:16.204 --> 01:06:17.173
Want?

01:06:34.755 --> 01:06:36.157
You may be
a good man.

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:40.495
Even if
I feel it.

01:06:44.532 --> 01:06:45.300
And I feel it.

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:53.509
But I've been
wrong before.

01:09:27.261 --> 01:09:28.462
I'm going
somewhere new.

01:09:30.997 --> 01:09:32.399
Well, new
enough, at least.

01:09:40.307 --> 01:09:41.644
I got into some
trouble again.

01:09:47.582 --> 01:09:49.551
But it's not going to
follow me, I don't think.

01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:56.725
I've got a ride
now, so-

01:10:08.737 --> 01:10:10.739
I'd like to come back,
if you'd have me back.

01:10:14.042 --> 01:10:15.410
But I understand-

01:10:15.443 --> 01:10:16.912
if that's not
something that-

01:10:20.515 --> 01:10:21.784
you want anymore.

01:10:34.328 --> 01:10:34.929
I miss you.

01:10:40.335 --> 01:10:42.605
And I hope that you
got my last message.

01:10:51.078 --> 01:10:53.381
At this point, I don't even know
if you're there anymore.

01:10:57.685 --> 01:10:58.453
Hey.

01:10:58.487 --> 01:10:59.587
Listen, I needs to
come by tonight.

01:11:01.922 --> 01:11:02.690
It's just-don't
go anywhere

01:11:02.724 --> 01:11:04.525
until I gets to
the shop, alright?

01:12:53.568 --> 01:12:54.436
What are you doing?

01:12:54.469 --> 01:12:54.935
Just get your shit.

01:12:54.969 --> 01:12:55.636
Let's go.

01:12:56.436 --> 01:12:57.171
I have to leave you here
for a little while, that's all.

01:12:57.204 --> 01:12:57.905
Just a short while.

01:12:58.773 --> 01:12:59.641
No.

01:13:00.942 --> 01:13:01.943
No, we've got
to get going.

01:13:01.975 --> 01:13:02.943
Come on.

01:13:02.976 --> 01:13:03.979
I've got to talk to my
cousin about something.

01:13:04.011 --> 01:13:04.979
Hey.

01:13:05.012 --> 01:13:06.414
Give him the keys to
the cabin, that's all-

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:06.882
and we're gone.

01:13:06.914 --> 01:13:07.849
Door's unlocked.

01:13:07.881 --> 01:13:08.750
Plenty of
food up there.

01:13:16.957 --> 01:13:17.625
Hey!

01:13:30.003 --> 01:13:30.872
Scott?

01:13:31.672 --> 01:13:32.140
Scott.

01:13:41.548 --> 01:13:42.818
You're going to
be fine here, okay?

01:13:43.251 --> 01:13:44.820
I'm not going to
be gone very long.

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:45.520
I promise.

01:13:48.523 --> 01:13:48.990
Scott?

01:13:49.957 --> 01:13:50.925
I promise.

01:14:53.054 --> 01:14:53.956
Double ought twelve.

01:14:57.225 --> 01:14:58.627
And a box of slugs.

01:14:59.927 --> 01:15:00.628
Size?

01:15:01.128 --> 01:15:01.930
Heaviest you've got.

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.002
I guess you're not
planning on eating it.

01:16:04.158 --> 01:16:04.993
Fuck sakes.

01:16:26.113 --> 01:16:27.214
What's going on, buddy?

01:16:31.685 --> 01:16:32.153
Bullshit!

01:16:40.795 --> 01:16:41.663
Yeah.

01:16:44.364 --> 01:16:46.702
What, are you
robbing me?

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:48.737
You calling
me a thief?

01:16:56.411 --> 01:16:57.645
You're with the
rest of them.

01:17:01.882 --> 01:17:02.716
Look, man.

01:17:02.751 --> 01:17:04.319
I got no stake in
any of this shit.

01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:07.923
What about that pretty
little girl you're fucking?

01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:09.958
Whatever she got
hooked up with

01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:11.193
on account of
Keith, she's out of it!

01:17:14.729 --> 01:17:15.163
You're ruined.

01:17:15.195 --> 01:17:16.064
What?

01:17:18.899 --> 01:17:20.735
She got you ruined,
right through.

01:17:21.569 --> 01:17:23.438
You're about to have
your whole world

01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:24.872
pulled right out
from under your feet.

01:17:25.139 --> 01:17:26.775
And you don't
even know it.

01:17:28.009 --> 01:17:29.043
You don't even
know her.

01:17:34.981 --> 01:17:35.615
Now get in
the truck.

01:17:35.649 --> 01:17:36.984
We're going
for a ride.

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.088
I got something
you might want.

01:17:41.922 --> 01:17:42.890
And if I gives
it to you-

01:17:42.923 --> 01:17:43.957
you gets in
that truck-

01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:45.193
you turns around
and you leaves.

01:17:45.225 --> 01:17:46.728
Alright? You fucks off!

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:09.718
Alright?

01:18:10.018 --> 01:18:10.886
All there.

01:18:13.287 --> 01:18:14.890
I found that where I
found your buddy.

01:18:17.524 --> 01:18:18.960
Take that
and go on.

01:18:29.002 --> 01:18:29.970
Get in the truck.

01:19:06.974 --> 01:19:08.176
She's in it for
survival, man.

01:19:12.078 --> 01:19:13.481
And you got caught
up in the middle.

01:19:57.958 --> 01:19:58.559
Holy shit!

01:19:58.826 --> 01:19:59.460
You fucking asshole!

01:19:59.493 --> 01:20:00.027
Hey hey!

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:01.129
Drop the fucking guy!

01:20:01.796 --> 01:20:04.097
Get on your
fucking knees!

01:20:04.131 --> 01:20:05.600
He didn't have anything
to do with this!

01:20:05.632 --> 01:20:06.268
Shut up!

01:20:08.502 --> 01:20:09.938
Let's fucking get
this over with.

01:20:30.091 --> 01:20:31.259
You too.

01:20:38.131 --> 01:20:39.067
What's that?

01:20:39.567 --> 01:20:40.534
You heard me.

01:20:42.235 --> 01:20:43.203
What the fuck, guys?

01:20:43.237 --> 01:20:44.972
We fucking got
this sorted!

01:20:45.006 --> 01:20:46.975
This is fucking bullshit!

01:20:47.007 --> 01:20:47.908
Fuck you!

01:20:47.942 --> 01:20:48.409
Get the fuck!

01:20:49.377 --> 01:20:50.011
Fuck you!

01:20:50.045 --> 01:20:52.279
You get that
fucking gun

01:20:52.313 --> 01:20:53.347
out of my
fucking face!

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:54.115
Shut the fuck up!

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:07.081
Stop!

01:23:07.113 --> 01:23:08.281
Stop!

01:23:08.314 --> 01:23:09.216
Ugh!

01:23:10.016 --> 01:23:10.751
I'll fucking stop
you for good!

01:24:37.304 --> 01:24:38.172
Ohh!

01:26:00.787 --> 01:26:03.290
You should've
had me in the other night.

01:26:03.323 --> 01:26:06.359
We could have all
this settled now.

01:26:06.393 --> 01:26:07.828
You weren't welcome.

01:26:17.805 --> 01:26:19.407
This baby is Keith's.

01:26:22.275 --> 01:26:23.778
Well, he's gone.

01:26:25.912 --> 01:26:30.817
And that's just some
bastard that belongs to you.

01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:04.652
There wasn't anything
I could do for him.

01:27:13.293 --> 01:27:13.760
Uhhh!

01:27:16.029 --> 01:27:17.764
Uhh!

01:27:33.846 --> 01:27:34.782
Uhh!

01:27:40.854 --> 01:27:42.356
Uhh!

01:28:17.824 --> 01:28:18.492
What?

01:28:28.702 --> 01:28:29.168
I got it.

01:28:29.203 --> 01:28:29.871
Hang on, hang on.

01:28:33.039 --> 01:28:34.775
You left me here!

01:28:35.576 --> 01:28:36.411
Are you okay?

01:28:37.578 --> 01:28:38.913
Where the
fuck were you?

01:28:38.945 --> 01:28:40.480
I don't know!

01:28:40.514 --> 01:28:43.851
They were going to shoot
me like a fucking dog!

01:28:43.884 --> 01:28:45.720
- What? Who?
- Liam was there.

01:28:45.752 --> 01:28:46.420
I don't know!

01:28:46.453 --> 01:28:49.789
But-I fucking
killed them!

01:28:49.823 --> 01:28:51.459
But I fucking
killed them, man.

01:28:58.832 --> 01:28:59.867
Uhhh!

01:29:03.069 --> 01:29:04.738
There's no one
gunning for you, now.

01:29:05.372 --> 01:29:06.574
There's no one
gunning for you.

01:29:06.606 --> 01:29:07.307
What?

01:29:07.341 --> 01:29:08.576
There's no one
gunning for you.

01:29:09.743 --> 01:29:10.878
Hey hey hey.

01:29:12.845 --> 01:29:14.748
Come on. Come on.

01:29:14.782 --> 01:29:15.416
No, that's alright.

01:29:15.448 --> 01:29:17.016
You go on.

01:29:17.050 --> 01:29:18.853
I left the keys
in the ignition.

01:29:21.788 --> 01:29:23.123
The truck is at
the gas station.

01:29:34.534 --> 01:29:36.804
Okay okay.

01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:57.218
Um-

01:30:57.251 --> 01:31:01.021
I won't bother
you anymore.

01:31:01.054 --> 01:31:02.222
I don't like talking
to your machine.

01:31:03.623 --> 01:31:04.524
Doesn't feel right.

01:31:07.994 --> 01:31:09.997
I just wanted to
try one more time.

01:31:12.865 --> 01:31:14.734
I know what kind of a
burden I must have been.

01:31:14.768 --> 01:31:15.670
Can I do it?

01:31:24.043 --> 01:31:24.945
We're on the move.

01:31:26.947 --> 01:31:28.149
I'm not sure
how far we'll go.

01:31:34.887 --> 01:31:37.158
But can you
see any fish?

01:31:37.823 --> 01:31:38.792
Mm-hmm. Do you?

01:31:39.059 --> 01:31:40.161
It's like some frontier.

01:31:43.663 --> 01:31:45.032
We can settle
wherever we want.
