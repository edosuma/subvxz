CHRIS ROCK:
After a couple of weeks
at Tattaglia without Greg,

00:09.243 --> 00:10.811
I tried hanging out
with a few different crowds

00:10.844 --> 00:13.447
to make myself feel better.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.283
I tried hanging out
with the losers.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.618
So, what do you want to
study

00:17.651 --> 00:20.621
Dude, why are you
always studying?

00:20.654 --> 00:23.624
Yeah, you act like we're
graduating tomorrow.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.659
Don't be such
a downer.

00:27.328 --> 00:30.398
I even tried hanging out
with the break-dance crews.

00:30.431 --> 00:34.502
*

00:34.535 --> 00:37.505
I only had a connection
with one person in the school,

00:37.538 --> 00:39.673
and it was the wrong type
of connection.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.110
What's up, Theo?

00:42.143 --> 00:44.112
There was only one time
during the day

00:44.145 --> 00:45.379
that I didn't miss Greg.

00:45.413 --> 00:46.414
Home Ec.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.582
It smelled like biscuits,

00:48.616 --> 00:50.284
and it looked
like Victoria's Secret.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.286
Greg wasn't there,

00:52.320 --> 00:54.588
but if there's one way
to replace one good friend,

00:54.622 --> 00:56.657
it's with a bunch
of strange women.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.693
Hey, that's how strip
clubs were born.

00:59.727 --> 01:03.764

PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

andVOLKSWAGEN.

01:07.801 --> 01:12.573
When you get into a Volkswagen,
it gets into you.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.609
* Aw, make it funky now.

01:33.394 --> 01:36.130
For a lot of guys, Home Ec
would have been a bad choice.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.765
But for me,
it was a perfect fit.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.734
Everything I did in class
I already did at home.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.370
These are good, Chris.

01:42.403 --> 01:44.405
Thanks. Maybe I could taste
your cookies sometime.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.706
What'd you say?

01:45.739 --> 01:46.707
Nothing.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.709
You know, I mean,

01:48.742 --> 01:50.744
like if you were
to bake some here.

01:50.778 --> 01:51.912
In class.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.647
Hmm. Don't be funny.

01:53.681 --> 01:54.948
Okay.

01:54.982 --> 01:58.619
Because I was a guy and a good
cook, I got a lot of attention.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.388
Bye, Chris.
Bye, Chris.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.522
The only girl in class

02:01.555 --> 02:04.758
who wouldn't give me the time
of day was Maria.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.895
Don't be mad at me
because you can't make toast.

02:07.928 --> 02:10.731
Back on my block, somebody was
catching heat besides me.

02:10.764 --> 02:13.334
A ticket?! How you gonna give me
a ticket?

02:13.367 --> 02:15.403
You're parked by a hydrant.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.438
Do you see a fire?
Do you smell smoke?

02:17.471 --> 02:18.739
Do you see a dog
trying to pee?

02:18.772 --> 02:20.308
You know what?
You need to give

02:20.341 --> 02:21.509
yourself a ticket.

02:21.542 --> 02:22.876
You're the one
that's double-parked.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.578
You give me that pad!

02:24.612 --> 02:25.713
Got you now!

02:25.746 --> 02:27.281
Now who's violent?

02:27.315 --> 02:28.616
Ah! How you like me now?

02:28.649 --> 02:29.850
Oh, oh. What,
what, what?

02:29.883 --> 02:31.319
Now, you got your ticket.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.553
What, you want
some of this?

02:32.586 --> 02:33.687
Would you look
at that?

02:33.721 --> 02:35.956
Now, she should be
ashamed of herself.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.958
Didn't you have a fight
with that meter maid?

02:37.991 --> 02:39.727
That was different.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.694
No, it wasn't.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.396
Do you see a fire?

02:42.430 --> 02:43.564
Do you smell smoke?

02:43.597 --> 02:45.299
Do you see a dog
trying to pee?

02:45.333 --> 02:47.468
What you need to do is
give yourself a ticket.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.702
You're the one
that's double-parked!

02:48.736 --> 02:49.437
Give me that!

02:49.470 --> 02:51.272
Give me that!
How's it feel now?

02:51.305 --> 02:53.274
I give the tickets!

02:55.809 --> 02:57.811
Mom, what are
you doing?

02:57.845 --> 02:59.413
That's your mother?

02:59.447 --> 03:02.816
Y'all get in the house.
Y'all go get in the house. Now!

03:02.850 --> 03:05.819
Mom, why are you
always doing this?

03:05.853 --> 03:08.522
Tasha, please, stop talking
to me like I'm your daughter.

03:08.556 --> 03:09.623
Hi!

03:09.657 --> 03:10.791
I'm Peaches!

03:10.824 --> 03:12.526
Hi. I'm Rochelle.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.262
This is Chris' mom.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.729
:
Rochelle?

03:17.765 --> 03:19.700
Oh, I heard so
much about you.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.969
Oh, my God. I've been meaning
to go upstairs and say hi.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.505
But, woo, things have been
so crazy since I got out.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.839
Got out?
Mm-hmm.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.007
Of what?

03:27.040 --> 03:27.975
Jail.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.977
Jail?
Mm-hmm.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.680
Ooh, girl,
can you believe it?

03:32.713 --> 03:35.849
I go out with this guy, he gon'
knock over a liquor store.

03:35.883 --> 03:36.950
I'm in the car,

03:36.984 --> 03:39.520
and he hop in with
a bag of money

03:39.553 --> 03:41.689
waving his gun talking about
"Drive, drive, drive!"

03:41.722 --> 03:43.624
Next thing I know

03:43.657 --> 03:45.393
I'm doing four to six years

03:45.426 --> 03:46.660
for aiding and
abetting.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.696
All right, well, I will
talk to you later.

03:48.729 --> 03:52.833
Ooh! Girl, that
is a nice purse!

03:52.866 --> 03:54.768
Oh, it's all leather.
Mm-hmm.

03:54.802 --> 03:57.771
See, I knew I would like you.
I love people with good taste.

03:57.805 --> 03:58.739
You're just like me.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.474
Minus the tackiness
and the rap sheet.

04:00.508 --> 04:01.809
Come on, Mom.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.944
She'll talk your ear off all day
if you let her.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.313
Oh, Tasha, please.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.418
While my mom was reeling,

04:10.451 --> 04:12.520
Drew and Tonya had Mr. Omar
on the hook.

04:12.553 --> 04:13.621
Okay,

04:13.654 --> 04:15.523
now, let's cut to the chase.

04:15.556 --> 04:16.724
This is Herman.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.725
All right,
now, this

04:17.758 --> 04:18.759
is the food.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.561
Now you put in two shakes.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.563
Not one, not three, two.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.064
Every day, after school.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.900
And if Herman survives,
I'll pay you ten dollars.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.636
What if Herman dies?

04:28.669 --> 04:29.737
Then I keep my money

04:29.770 --> 04:31.605
and buy me another fish.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.007
Oh! The Color Purple!
Can we watch it?

04:34.041 --> 04:35.142
I love Danny Glover.

04:35.175 --> 04:37.478
Mister was the best movie
villain since Darth Vader.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.513
No. Leave my movies alone.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.682
Don't touch anything,
don't eat anything.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.384
Don't sit, search or stare.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.387
Just feed Herman and leave.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.455
Got it?

04:47.488 --> 04:49.623
Yes.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.959
While Mr. Omar's fish
were about to get fed,

04:51.992 --> 04:54.495
things in Home Ec
were about to get cooking.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.497
Okay, for our second group
of partners,

04:56.530 --> 05:01.369
we have Sadie and Lola, Tiffany
and Amber, Chris and...

05:01.402 --> 05:04.372
Chris and Maria, Chris
and Maria, Chris and Maria...

05:04.405 --> 05:05.373
...and Angel.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.741
I hadn't noticed Angel before,

05:07.775 --> 05:09.443
but if she looked
like her name,

05:09.477 --> 05:12.079
as Greg would say,
I was about to be in there.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.481
Where's Angel?

05:13.514 --> 05:14.982
Right over there.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.823
Hi. I'm Chris.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.958
:
Hi. I'm Angel.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.661
Ahn
More like, "What the hell?"

05:27.695 --> 05:29.363
Ahn
What's up with the outfit?

05:29.397 --> 05:30.398
And the makeup?

05:30.431 --> 05:31.932
I'm androgynous, silly.

05:31.965 --> 05:35.135
Around 1986, a new trend emerged
called androgyny.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.870
Inspired by the looks
of personalities

05:36.904 --> 05:39.707
such as Boy George,
Prince, Grace Jones

05:39.740 --> 05:41.609
and Attorney General Janet Reno,

05:41.642 --> 05:43.444
gender benders,
as they were also called,

05:43.477 --> 05:44.978
stretched the perceptions
of what it meant

05:45.012 --> 05:46.647
to be male or female.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.549
Ahn
What type of name is that?

05:48.582 --> 05:49.983
It's Boriqua, baby.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.085
Look, I know what you're doing.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.754
I wish I could say the same.

05:53.787 --> 05:54.988
You do?
Yes.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.057
I know you boys like
to come into Home Ec

05:57.090 --> 05:59.993
trying to do more
than bake cookies.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.396
You and me,
we could be friends.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.764
I could use you.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.899
I don't think I like
where this is headed.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.435
What are you talking about?

06:07.468 --> 06:10.871
Me, I understand fashion,
hair and Madonna,

06:10.904 --> 06:13.173
but I'm terrible in the kitchen.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.141
So?

06:14.174 --> 06:16.009
I saw you looking at Maria.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.010
All I'm saying

06:17.044 --> 06:19.413
is that, if
you help me,

06:19.447 --> 06:20.581
I can help you.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.850
And how is that?

06:22.883 --> 06:24.117
Chelsea?

06:24.151 --> 06:26.086
What, Angel?

06:26.119 --> 06:27.855
This boy just broke up
with his girlfriend.

06:27.888 --> 06:28.956
Oh.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.024
He's depressing me
with sad talk.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.927
Would you kiss him
on the cheek?

06:33.961 --> 06:35.996
He needs
a reason to live.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.567
How's that?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.001
Yeah. It was good.

06:41.034 --> 06:44.438
So do we have a deal?

06:44.472 --> 06:45.439
What?

06:45.473 --> 06:46.707
Do we have a deal?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.141
Oh. Uh... Yeah.

06:49.477 --> 06:50.944
Ow!

06:50.978 --> 06:53.447
I broke his androgyny bone!

06:57.618 --> 06:59.820
While Maria
couldn't make a corn flake,

06:59.853 --> 07:01.555
I helped Angel make a cake.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.657
Angel, your cake

07:03.691 --> 07:04.925
is amazing.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.060
I couldn't have
done it without Chris.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.896
If you want an "A"
on your next project,

07:08.929 --> 07:10.898
that is your boy.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.566
Really?

07:12.600 --> 07:14.935
(Aerosmith's
"Dude Looks Like a Lady" plays)

07:14.968 --> 07:16.504
Chris?

07:16.537 --> 07:17.505
Yes?

07:17.538 --> 07:19.239
Maria.
Yes.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.842
I was wondering...
Yes?

07:21.875 --> 07:23.977
...if maybe you can
help me make a cake?

07:24.011 --> 07:24.878
Yes.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.980
She may not know
how to work an oven,

07:27.014 --> 07:28.782
but she knows how to work me.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.518
Charming, he cooks...

07:30.551 --> 07:31.852
I don't know, Maria.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.588
Sounds like a catch to me.

07:34.622 --> 07:37.257
We'll see about that
after we make the cake.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.927
See you, Chris.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.962
Yes.

07:41.995 --> 07:45.132
Me and Angel made a deal
to work together in class,

07:45.165 --> 07:46.934
but being seen together
in the hallway

07:46.967 --> 07:50.103
was a whole other thing.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.972
Yeah. I have to go ask
Mrs. Williams something.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.641
Yeah. I'll
catch you later.

07:53.674 --> 07:58.579
* That, that dude
looks like a lady... *

07:58.612 --> 08:00.814
Back at Mr. Omar's,

08:00.848 --> 08:04.117
Tonya was worried
about being seen, too.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.986
What are you doing?

08:06.019 --> 08:07.254
I was watching
The Color Purple.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.056
Mr. Omar said not
to touch his stuff.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.991
I wasn't touching.
I was watching.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.661
Fine. If anything gets
messed up, it's on you.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.062
Nothing's going
to get messed up,

08:15.095 --> 08:16.296
so shut up.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.931
Come on.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.172
Hey, Rochelle!

08:25.205 --> 08:27.240
Hey!

08:27.274 --> 08:29.543
Translation:
"Who told you where I work?"

08:29.577 --> 08:30.844
Who told you where I work?

08:30.878 --> 08:31.645
Who's this?

08:31.679 --> 08:33.013
I'm Peaches.

08:33.046 --> 08:33.981
That's, uh,
Tasha's mother.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.315
She just moved
in next door.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.217
Girl, you look
just like your daughter.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.151
With a rap sheet.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.587
I'm Vanessa.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.821
Vanessa

08:40.854 --> 08:42.990
Oh, this is your shop!
Oh, this is nice!

08:43.023 --> 08:44.625
Oh! Rochelle, I should
have known you worked

08:44.658 --> 08:46.159
at a nice place like this.
Just don't rob it.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.160
Just don't rob it.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.562
Rob it?

08:48.596 --> 08:50.297
She is just joking!

08:50.330 --> 08:51.965
I just got
out of jail.
Jail?

08:51.999 --> 08:52.966
Mm-hmm.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.034
Which one?
Taconic.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.202
Oh. Medium security.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.237
What were you doing? Aiding
and abetting or something?

08:57.270 --> 08:59.306
Yeah, girl, you know
how that is.
You do?

08:59.339 --> 09:01.975
It almost happened to me once.
I was just sitting in a car...

09:02.009 --> 09:04.177
Supposed to be on a date?
Guy hops in
with a bag of money...

09:04.211 --> 09:06.880
Talk about, "Drive!"?
Drive? I hopped out
and ran.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.081
That's what
you should have done.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.016
That's what I should
have done.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.317
Okay, Peaches.
All right, girl.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.319
Well, I will
see you later...
Ooh! Oh! Oh!

09:12.352 --> 09:14.187
Oh, speaking of later!
Oh, girl, I need a touch-up.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.255
Tasha's staying with
some friends tonight.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.858
I'm going out with this guy,
and I need to look good.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.993
Then you better not
show him your tattoos.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.061
Don't show him your tattoos.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.796
You got tattoos?
I was in jail.

09:22.830 --> 09:23.864
I'll squeeze
you in.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.032
Sit down.
Oh, girl,

09:25.065 --> 09:27.067
thank you!

09:27.100 --> 09:29.737
I was cool with Angel,
but not with androgyny,

09:29.770 --> 09:31.605
so I asked my dad for help.

09:31.639 --> 09:32.973
Hey, Dad?

09:33.006 --> 09:36.043
Hey. You did a good job
with dinner tonight.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.211
Thanks.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.113
Can I ask you
a question?

09:40.147 --> 09:43.250
I'm not giving up
my sweet potato pie recipe.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.318
You're just going
to have to kill me first.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.287
Oh. Oh, no.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.660
See, there's this guy
in my Home Ec class.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.194
You having a problem?

09:54.227 --> 09:56.063
No, not at all.

09:56.096 --> 09:59.199
He's just a little flamboyant.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.768
Flamboyant?

10:00.801 --> 10:03.170
Yeah. He looks kind
of like Boy George.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.673
Oh, you mean
androgynous?

10:05.706 --> 10:06.974
Yeah.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.409
We have to partner
on this project, and he's cool.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.078
I just don't want
people thinking

10:11.111 --> 10:13.213
that me and him hang out
like that.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.949
I knew this androgynous
guy when I was coming up.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.718
You did?
Yeah.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.120
He was one of the
baddest dudes I ever met.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.755
Pink Bobby Jenkins.

10:21.789 --> 10:24.257
He was androgynous way
before it was popular.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.226
Everybody used to
make fun of him.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.061
Pink Bobby?

10:28.095 --> 10:29.429
So, did you guys hang out?

10:29.462 --> 10:30.664
Nope.

10:30.698 --> 10:33.133
I didn't want people to
think I was androgynous.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.435
Then one day, I was
coming home from school,

10:35.468 --> 10:36.904
and these guys jumped me.

10:36.937 --> 10:39.172
Oh, they
had me, too.

10:39.206 --> 10:42.242
Then, next thing I know,
here comes Pink Bobby.

10:42.275 --> 10:46.246
Man, Pink Bobby was
knocking suckers out.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.915
I asked him
why'd he help me,

10:47.948 --> 10:49.349
even though I
wouldn't talk to him.

10:49.382 --> 10:52.185
But he said he didn't care
that I didn't talk to him.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.254
It was because I
didn't talk about him.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.857
After that, we
were always cool.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.292
And people didn't think
you were androgynous?

10:59.326 --> 11:02.195
Look, Chris, unless
you show up in a dress,

11:02.229 --> 11:04.197
heels and makeup,

11:04.231 --> 11:06.266
nobody's gonna think
you're androgynous.

11:06.299 --> 11:09.002
Thanks, Dad.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.942
Surprise!
Surprise!

11:14.975 --> 11:16.443
Malvo?

11:16.476 --> 11:17.911
You two know each other?

11:17.945 --> 11:19.179
Yeah, baby, we
old friends.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.114
This is the guy you were
talking about?
Yeah.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.816
But I didn't know you two knew
each other.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.317
Why didn't you
say something?
Baby, 'cause you

11:24.351 --> 11:26.019
wouldn't quit talking.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.021
He is so stupid.
Ain't he stupid?

11:28.055 --> 11:29.823
Is that a trick question?

11:29.857 --> 11:31.091
Rochelle, you
are crazy.

11:31.124 --> 11:31.959
Oh, I could say

11:31.992 --> 11:34.294
the same thing about you.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.297
Oh, baby.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.166
Oh, come on,
let's go sit down.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.333
Yeah.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.902
This is crazy.
Ain't this crazy?

11:41.935 --> 11:43.737
This is crazy, baby.
Whoo!

11:43.771 --> 11:45.973
There haven't been this many
ex-cons in one place

11:46.006 --> 11:48.776
since Naomi Campbell
had lunch with Amy Winehouse.

11:48.809 --> 11:49.943
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.311
Whoo!

11:51.344 --> 11:52.780
Thanks for
dinner, y'all.
Yeah.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.982
I'm glad y'all showed
up when y'all did,

11:55.015 --> 11:56.817
because we were done
eating an hour ago.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.251
MALVO:
See, that's why
y'all are good people.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.253
You know, if it had have
been me, I would have been,

12:00.287 --> 12:01.922
like, "I hope they ain't
hungry." You know?

12:01.955 --> 12:03.991
Well, how did you two meet?

12:04.024 --> 12:06.026
We both got
the same parole officer.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.227
We were taking our drug tests,

12:07.260 --> 12:08.461
and he was coming out
the bathroom.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.197
And she was coming
down the hall and...

12:10.230 --> 12:12.432
BOTH:
We was both holding
cups of pee.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.167
Oh, baby!

12:14.201 --> 12:15.903
Sounds like a love story
for R. Kelly.

12:15.936 --> 12:16.904
That sounds nice.

12:16.937 --> 12:17.938
See, I wanted you to meet him

12:17.971 --> 12:19.272
to get your opinion,
but you already know him,

12:19.306 --> 12:21.541
so that's good
enough for me.
Hey, y'all

12:21.574 --> 12:24.311
got any Jell-O or something
like that for dessert?

12:24.344 --> 12:27.881
I'll see what I can find.

12:27.915 --> 12:30.350
Rochelle, you want
to give me a hand?
Okay, baby.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.518
MALVO:
Cool.

12:31.551 --> 12:34.287
PEACHES:
Malvo?
Hmm?

12:34.321 --> 12:35.455
PEACHES:
You like Jell

12:35.488 --> 12:36.824
MALVO:
Baby, I love Jell-O.

12:36.857 --> 12:37.891
PEACHES:
I love Jell-O, too!

12:37.925 --> 12:38.959
Does it say...

12:38.992 --> 12:41.128
: Does it say
"Rikers Island" on our door?

12:41.161 --> 12:43.363
No.
Then why are there
two convicts in my house?

12:43.396 --> 12:45.432
She just showed up. What
was I supposed to do?

12:45.465 --> 12:47.000
Tell her to just get out.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.401
I don't want
to be rude.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.337
Look, she barged in,
she ate our food,

12:50.370 --> 12:51.538
and she brought a guest.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.406
She's rude.
She's Tasha's
mother, okay?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.275
Now, for Chris
and Tasha's sake,

12:55.308 --> 12:57.077
we have to be
neighborly.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.445
Look, be neighborly
at her house.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.213
I don't want her in here.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.381
Come on, ya'll.

13:01.414 --> 13:02.382
Where the Jell

13:02.415 --> 13:04.384
Did you try Bill Cosby's house?

13:04.417 --> 13:07.387
Back at school, I decided
to step out of my comfort zone

13:07.420 --> 13:09.422
and into my discomfort zone.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.191
You'll get
your Eurythmics tape back

13:11.224 --> 13:12.559
when I give it back, bitch.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.161
Hey, man.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.428
Hey.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.930
You want to go
get some lunch

13:16.964 --> 13:18.098
and hang out
or something?

13:18.131 --> 13:19.166
No.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.300
Why not?

13:24.137 --> 13:27.040
Chris, you're a nice guy.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.876
I don't know how to say this.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.978
I don't mind working
with you in class,

13:31.011 --> 13:32.612
but being seen
with you out here--

13:32.645 --> 13:34.114
it's a whole other thing.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.516
I get picked on enough
for the way I dress.

13:36.549 --> 13:39.319
Hanging out with you will
give people one more reason.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.955
I just got the
"It's not you, it's me" speech

13:41.989 --> 13:43.957
from a guy who wears pumps?

13:43.991 --> 13:46.493
While I figure out my feelings,
let's take a break.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.232
Without Greg around
to talk this out,

13:52.265 --> 13:53.500
I decided to talk to myself.

13:53.533 --> 13:56.069
Dude, who was that androgynous
guy you were just talking to?

13:56.103 --> 13:57.370
Oh, that's Angel.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.406
Do I need to
kick his ass?

13:59.439 --> 14:00.473
Don't try it.
Androgynous guys

14:00.507 --> 14:02.442
have a reputation
for being great fighters.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.511
Nah, he's cool.
He's in my Home Ec class.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.147
Home Ec?
Do I need to kick your ass?

14:07.180 --> 14:10.350
You don't understand. He's tight
with every girl in the class.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.351
They trade clothes.

14:11.384 --> 14:12.352
He's gonna hook me up.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.353
Yeah

14:13.386 --> 14:15.455
Hey, Chris.
Yes?

14:15.488 --> 14:17.324
You're gonna help me
with that cake, right?

14:17.357 --> 14:19.059
Yes.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.228
Good. Who's your friend?

14:21.261 --> 14:22.896
How you doin', honey?
I'm Greg.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.031
I like your coat.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.233
The skullcap is another story.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.500
Man, you're so in there.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.602
Anyways, I gotta go
beat up some nerds.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.104
Have fun at your bake-off.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.472
If you don't find any nerds,

14:32.505 --> 14:35.042
you could just punch yourself
in the face.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.377
While I got a sleeveful, my
mother was getting an earful.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.345
He's a Pisces.
I'm an Aquarius.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.247
That's fish and water.
That go together, right?

14:40.280 --> 14:42.115
Ooh, girl, that ain't...

14:42.149 --> 14:44.151
Peaches, I would love
to talk to you right now,

14:44.184 --> 14:46.286
but I gotta cook.
Ooh, I could
help you cook.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.521
You makin' chicken, I could fry
it, corn, I could shuck it.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.158
I can make a mean grilled cheese
with a iron if you're desperate.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.159
No, that's okay.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.460
And if you're really desperate,

14:53.493 --> 14:55.929
wine out of toilet water
and a gun out of soap.

14:55.963 --> 14:58.031
Okay, my grilled cheese
is fresh to die...

14:58.065 --> 15:00.000
Peaches?
Huh?
Stop, okay?

15:00.033 --> 15:02.302
I really appreciate the fact
that you like me,

15:02.335 --> 15:04.471
but we have
to set some boundaries.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.272
Like prison gates.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.607
Oh, okay, okay.
Girl, say no more.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.441
See, we just alike.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.543
You need your space,
I need my space.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.113
Right.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.247
Okay!
Okay!

15:14.281 --> 15:15.983
Well, call me. Okay?
Okay.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.217
You gonna call me?
Sure.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.952
No, I'm-a call you
when you done, okay?

15:18.986 --> 15:21.154
No, no, I'll call you.
I'll call you. Yeah.

15:21.188 --> 15:22.322
Okay, well, call me.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.957
I'll call you. Okay. Bye.

15:23.991 --> 15:26.226
Okay.
Okay.

15:27.494 --> 15:30.130
Hmm. Okay.

15:30.163 --> 15:35.068
Uh-huh, all right,
all right, all right.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.403
Everything seems to be in order.

15:36.436 --> 15:40.007
Herman is healthy.
Mission accomplished.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.208
DREW:
Thank you.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.210
You didn't touch
anything, did you?

15:43.243 --> 15:44.211
No.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.079
No.
All right.

15:46.113 --> 15:50.317
This is the beginning
of a beautiful relationship.

15:58.225 --> 16:01.028
Yo, y'all have
to try this cake.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.762
My girl Maria
made it for me.

16:02.795 --> 16:06.466
Maria

16:06.499 --> 16:08.701
Well, she ain't my girl girl,
just this girl.

16:08.735 --> 16:09.602
She diggin' on me.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.072
I told her she need
to be able to cook

16:12.105 --> 16:14.141
if she wants to get with me.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.510
See, I don't like
girls that can't cook.

16:17.544 --> 16:18.611
So you like her?

16:18.645 --> 16:20.280
Well, I don't know about her,

16:20.313 --> 16:22.115
but I like this cake.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.550
You want a piece? Try it.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.485
I was using cake
to get closer to Maria

16:25.518 --> 16:28.388
and she was using cake
to get closer to Dickerson,

16:28.421 --> 16:30.623
and it didn't work
for either one of us.

16:36.296 --> 16:39.532
Oh! Rochelle!
You scared the...!

16:39.566 --> 16:42.102
Peaches, what the hell
are you doing in my house?!

16:42.135 --> 16:45.172
Girl, I lost my keys,
Tasha wasn't home,

16:45.205 --> 16:46.473
so I just let myself in.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.474
You let yourself in?

16:47.507 --> 16:48.475
Mm-hmm.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.477
There's three locks on the door.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.145
Oh, yeah, those are no good.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.213
You really need to upgrade.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.381
I mean, having those locks

16:54.414 --> 16:56.216
is like leaving
your door wide open.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.750
No, it's not.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.453
That was a closed door
with three locks on it.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.789
Why didn't you break
into your own house?

17:02.822 --> 17:04.457
That's what I'm saying.
It's the locks.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.626
Mine are unpickable. You think
I'm gonna be standing out

17:06.659 --> 17:08.495
on the street looking like I'm
breaking into somebody's house?

17:08.528 --> 17:11.698
Peaches, what's
wrong with you?

17:11.731 --> 17:15.335
Do you remember
the talk that we had
about boundaries?

17:15.368 --> 17:17.204
I needed your advice,
and I have been

17:17.237 --> 17:18.538
sitting here
all day waiting for you...

17:18.571 --> 17:19.539
Peaches...

17:19.572 --> 17:21.108
What?

17:21.141 --> 17:22.775
How would you feel
if you came home

17:22.809 --> 17:25.478
and I was in your house
with your man?

17:25.512 --> 17:27.780
Why would I know
where your man is?

17:27.814 --> 17:29.382
Oh, by the way, Vanessa called.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.817
She said make sure
you call her back.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.252
You answered my phone?!

17:32.285 --> 17:34.487
What? You acting
like I stole something!

17:34.521 --> 17:36.256
You are a criminal.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.325
I was an accomplice!

17:38.358 --> 17:40.527
That is not the same thing!

17:40.560 --> 17:42.662
They locked you up
in the same jail.

17:42.695 --> 17:45.365
Oh, oh, okay, I get it.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.867
So you think
that I am a criminal!

17:47.900 --> 17:49.602
Joker, joker, joker.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.871
I mean, what else
am I supposed to think?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.473
You know what?
Think what you want.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.641
No, I'm thinking.

17:54.674 --> 17:55.608
Think that.
No, really,
I'm thinking.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.110
No, think that.
I'm thinking.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.678
Think that.
Believe me,
I'm thinking that!

17:58.711 --> 18:00.213
And stay away
from my Turtles.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.149
Well, you outta milk!

18:02.749 --> 18:04.684
Hey, hey! Hey!

18:04.717 --> 18:05.718
DREW:
Hey, Mr. Omar.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.287
Uh-uh, don't "Hey" me.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.422
I know y'all were watching
my videotape machine.

18:09.456 --> 18:10.623
How?

18:10.657 --> 18:11.791
The counter told on you.

18:11.824 --> 18:15.695
It was at 0743.
Now it says 0002.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.297
So?

18:17.330 --> 18:19.566
So? So the lady I'm seeing
likes to do things

18:19.599 --> 18:21.401
by the numbers.
I was waiting on 800.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.503
She had a special surprise
for me at 800,

18:23.536 --> 18:24.371
and you ruined it!

18:24.404 --> 18:26.439
The surprise was,
she was a man.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.640
Isn't that kinda weird?

18:27.674 --> 18:28.875
Isn't that kinda none
of your business?

18:28.908 --> 18:32.579
Look, I told you
not to touch anything.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.815
A deal is a deal.
Now give me back my money.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.552
Any day now.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.288
Tragic!

18:41.321 --> 18:45.225
(Cyndi Lauper's
"True Colors" plays)

18:45.258 --> 18:48.761
Um, listen, Rochelle,

18:48.795 --> 18:50.930
I'm sorry for breaking
into your apartment.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.865
Okay.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.702
And you know I think
you're smart and stylish...

18:55.735 --> 18:56.703
Mm-hmm.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.271
Like me.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.340
And I'd really like for us
to be friends.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.209
I don't know, Peaches.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.843
You've really went
a little too far.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.512
I know.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.717
Well, I'm sorry for calling
you a criminal.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.652
It's okay.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.621
Okay.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.623
* I see your true colors...

19:16.656 --> 19:18.191
Hey!
Hey!

19:18.225 --> 19:21.528
What the hell you think
you're doing?!
What the hell
you think you're doing?!

19:21.561 --> 19:22.629
Get away
from that car!

19:22.662 --> 19:25.198
Angel and I were reaching
a new understanding.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.334
Sorry about Maria.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.336
It's cool. You know, that's
just how girls are.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.737
That's why
I don't mess with them.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.340
No, it's not.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.708
So, I'll talk
to you tomorrow.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.544
See ya.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.749
Yeah, you can go first.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.517
Yep. Bye.

19:45.752 --> 19:48.821
After all was said and done,
even a roomful of girls

19:48.855 --> 19:51.758
wasn't the same as having
one good friend.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.332
Greg

19:59.366 --> 20:00.833
Got kicked out
of the Bronx Academy.

20:00.867 --> 20:01.834
So I'm back.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.503
See you still have that coat.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.772
I've changed in ways
you couldn't imagine, Chris.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.241
I've seen things.
I've done things.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.477
I've tasted blood
and it tastes good.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.246
Taste that, Tonto.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.215
See you later, Kemo Sabe.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.618
Welcome back, dude.

20:18.651 --> 20:19.852
Thanks.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.922
* Everybody hates Chris

20:22.955 --> 20:24.457
* And Greg. *

20:41.508 --> 20:43.810
* Aw, make it funky now.
