Since when?

08:47.076 --> 08:48.326
- Hey.
- Ah!

08:48.410 --> 08:49.784
[with German accent]
Welcome to the camps.

08:49.868 --> 08:51.701
- Walt, no.
- Happy birthday, old man.

08:51.784 --> 08:52.868
- Sorry.

to Miguel and Margaret?

- Oh, shit, nobody told you?

09:00.243 --> 09:02.576
- Have you not spoken
to Margaret?

09:02.659 --> 09:04.243
- Well, not directly.

09:04.326 --> 09:05.492

a good groove.

She's finished.

She's fucking a waiter
from 9021Pho.

09:10.826 --> 09:13.368

09:14.617 --> 09:17.076
- All right,
which one's ours, Carleen?

09:17.160 --> 09:19.534

ours is.

09:33.451 --> 09:35.243

I can't believe

this information.

09:42.326 --> 09:43.617
- Well, it's private.

09:43.701 --> 09:46.617
I didn't want to betray
Margaret's confidence.

09:46.701 --> 09:47.951
- Well, that's reasonable.
- That's a stupid thing

09:48.034 --> 09:50.076

- Oh! Sisters.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.742
- No, I'm sorry for them,
and this--

09:51.826 --> 09:53.659
this is a tragedy
for all of us,

09:53.742 --> 09:56.076
but I hope they don't think
they can not pay,

09:56.160 --> 09:58.368

between four couples.

covering them with the economy

doing much better.

at a very good rate

10:07.826 --> 10:09.909

- Carleen, do you have

I guess she just wanted
to give you

10:43.160 --> 10:44.659

- Well, yeah, I've been

10:44.742 --> 10:47.201

because I'm the touchstone.

10:47.285 --> 10:50.118

it is wonderful so far.

nut and seed bars.

can be attributed, potentially,

I also want you to know
that I'm genuinely positive

that we can restore
some balance during the course

12:24.285 --> 12:25.784
of this trip,
and I want to make it clear

12:25.868 --> 12:27.410
that much of what I was
going through was hormonal

12:27.492 --> 12:30.118

bioidentical hormones.
