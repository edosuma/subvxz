- Hey, have we got maths today?
- Yeah.

04:12.958 --> 04:14.666
Our homework was so hard.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.291
Yeah, it's tricky.

04:16.375 --> 04:17.708
- Morning!
- Thanks, Miss.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.541
The hardest ever...

04:26.833 --> 04:28.500
How's that? That's not too tight?

04:30.041 --> 04:32.083
Okay, so the hours of your curfew

04:32.166 --> 04:34.666
are 10:00 p.m. till 7:00 a.m.
to accommodate your job.

04:34.750 --> 04:36.958
So the equipment is actually
your responsibility.

04:37.041 --> 04:39.000
So don't tamper with the strap
or the unit,

04:39.083 --> 04:40.625
and don't let anyone else tamper with it.

04:40.708 --> 04:43.416
Um, otherwise, yeah, you will be
in breach of your probation.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.541
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- No, no, I'm fine.

04:45.625 --> 04:47.791
It's actually, uh, in case you poison me.

04:47.875 --> 04:48.916
Oh.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
No, that is actually policy.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.958
Um, if you wouldn't mind following me

04:53.041 --> 04:54.958
just so the unit can get
a sense of the location?

04:55.041 --> 04:56.208
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

04:56.291 --> 04:57.250
We need to-- Get up!

05:00.083 --> 05:02.583
So, what happen, Simone?
You no have no man yet?

05:03.750 --> 05:05.583
Let me tell you something about men.

05:06.375 --> 05:09.125
Them is genetically programmed

05:09.208 --> 05:10.625
to be horndog!

05:10.708 --> 05:12.291
True she talk!

05:12.375 --> 05:15.666
So don't let them cock up them leg
and piss up on you.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.041
I will try not to.

05:19.250 --> 05:20.458
Hello, Doo-Doo.

05:21.083 --> 05:22.208
Mm-hmm.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.250
Me make myself pretty for you.

05:25.250 --> 05:26.125
Hmm.

05:26.208 --> 05:27.500
Stop that!

05:28.791 --> 05:32.791
Listen, you know you see me
being a bad girl already.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.458
Mm-hmm.

05:34.541 --> 05:35.375
You wait.

05:39.500 --> 05:43.500
Rah! You love to pretend
like you ain't seeing me calling you.

05:43.583 --> 05:47.375
Simone! Don't make me come and pull you
out by your ear, you understand?

05:47.458 --> 05:48.416
Call me back.

05:52.291 --> 05:53.791
What's up, Yvonne?

05:53.875 --> 05:54.833
Mmm.

05:54.916 --> 05:56.000
How you living?

05:56.083 --> 05:58.750
Just a kidnapped princess
trying to find my country.

05:58.833 --> 06:01.375
- How you living?
- Oh, my, it's hot out there.

06:01.458 --> 06:03.333
- Mmm.
- I need a shower.

06:04.833 --> 06:06.000
Here's my package.

06:09.083 --> 06:10.000
That's my number.

06:10.791 --> 06:12.041
Forget the swipe right...

06:12.916 --> 06:14.583
and call me.

06:45.166 --> 06:46.708
Who was that boy at school?

06:46.791 --> 06:49.000
Oh, yeah, Ben.
He's in my maths class.

06:49.083 --> 06:49.916
Ben...

06:50.000 --> 06:53.333
Roisin's mum's getting married again.
She's gonna have a little brother.

06:53.416 --> 06:57.125
- Oh. Oh, no. Poor Roisin.
- She wants a little brother.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.750
I'm just joking.

07:03.583 --> 07:05.208
How's that? Is that all right?

07:07.333 --> 07:08.958
Simone! Simone!

07:09.041 --> 07:11.333
What's the matter? What's the matter?

07:12.125 --> 07:16.166
It's cold outside. You love to pretend
like you don't see me calling you, huh?

07:16.250 --> 07:17.958
I'm sorry,
I thought it was an emergency!

07:18.041 --> 07:20.500
Yeah, it is! Your vagina called
and told me it's dying.

07:20.583 --> 07:21.666
Hi, honey! How you've been?

07:21.750 --> 07:22.916
What are you doing?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.583
You get more and more beautiful every day.

07:25.666 --> 07:26.916
- Yvonne!
- Mm-hm?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.750
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. You?

07:30.083 --> 07:33.625
Mandy, I got a question for you.
How bomb would your mum...

07:33.708 --> 07:36.666
look in... this!

07:36.750 --> 07:39.000
- I'm too tired for this, babe.
- Woo.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.291
- Yvonne.
- Yes?

07:40.375 --> 07:42.916
- What are you doing?
- We are going out.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.750
- Auntie Vonnie?
- Yes?

07:46.833 --> 07:48.666
My mother has no interest in going out.

07:49.125 --> 07:50.875
That's a clever girl. Look at that.

07:50.958 --> 07:52.000
Oh.

07:52.083 --> 07:54.791
Go to sleep before I pitch you
off the balcony. Mm-hmm.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.500
Yvonne, even your mum has more fun.

07:56.583 --> 07:58.416
Yeah, because my mum has
zero responsibilities.

07:58.500 --> 08:01.958
- I've got responsibilities, thank you.
- She got another responsibility.

08:03.541 --> 08:05.541
Ooh!

08:05.625 --> 08:07.833
Never fear,
the babysitter is here.

08:08.333 --> 08:09.833
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Hey, Martina.

08:09.916 --> 08:10.958
Hello, Martina.

08:11.541 --> 08:12.375
Mum?

08:12.666 --> 08:15.000
Mum? Yeah, It's fine.
I don't-- We're here tonight.

08:15.083 --> 08:16.166
- Want a chicken nugget?
- No!

08:16.250 --> 08:18.625
She's had dinner.
She had steamed fish and kale.

08:18.708 --> 08:20.416
That's no food for a growing girl.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.625
No, it is food for a growing girl.
Not chicken nuggets!

08:22.708 --> 08:24.750
Come on, Mandy. Let's go upstairs.

08:24.833 --> 08:26.958
We're going out. And we're gonna par--

08:28.875 --> 08:30.791
- What you looking at?
- What are you wearing?

08:31.291 --> 08:33.750
Tomasz bought this for me.

08:34.166 --> 08:36.541
- Tomasz?
- Yeah, he's the new caretaker.

08:36.625 --> 08:37.541
Oh, God.

08:37.625 --> 08:38.666
What?

08:38.750 --> 08:39.582
I don't know.

08:39.666 --> 08:42.291
So spiky. Uptight.

08:42.375 --> 08:45.250
- Not like you, sweetheart.
- Nothing wrong with being uptight.

08:45.333 --> 08:48.708
Maybe that's what attracts blokes
like... Kestrel, eh?

08:48.791 --> 08:51.208
Oh, okay. Maybe I'll avoid them
if I dress like a pineapple.

08:51.291 --> 08:52.458
Happy little pineapple.

08:52.541 --> 08:54.708
- Come on, Mandy! Bedtime!
- Mandy?

08:54.791 --> 08:56.541
Come out on the town with us, babe.

08:56.625 --> 08:57.750
I'm nine.

08:57.833 --> 08:59.833
You go out, we're staying in to play.

08:59.916 --> 09:02.291
- We're not going out to play.
- I'm not here for nothing.

09:03.291 --> 09:06.750
The mother is pregnant 22 months.

09:06.833 --> 09:07.958
And will breastfeed...

09:08.041 --> 09:11.125
Simone, this is so dead.
This is so upsetting.

09:12.291 --> 09:14.208
You need to change your perspective, babe.

09:14.291 --> 09:16.083
I don't need to change my perspective.

09:16.166 --> 09:18.166
Yeah, you do. This is adulthood.

09:18.250 --> 09:19.541
I am an adult.

09:19.625 --> 09:22.458
I go to work,
I pay my bills, I pay my rent,

09:22.541 --> 09:25.916
I buy vibrators, I have sex, and I drink.

09:28.958 --> 09:32.416
No, I don't want blueberries or anything
that's gonna make me more like you.

09:32.958 --> 09:34.416
You need to get your piece wet!

09:34.500 --> 09:35.708
You're vulgar.

09:35.791 --> 09:39.416
Yes, I am vulgar, and that's a good thing.
I am so happy!

09:39.500 --> 09:41.208
Look at how happy I am.

09:41.291 --> 09:42.791
I am un-stressed.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.375
You...

09:44.791 --> 09:48.208
You're tense. You know why? 'Cause you
never let nobody rub up on you,

09:48.291 --> 09:50.416
giving you a transcending experience.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.708
If I want a transcending experience,
I'll go to church, Yvonne.

10:20.458 --> 10:22.500

10:22.583 --> 10:24.166
Pick her up around five!

10:24.250 --> 10:26.291

10:26.375 --> 10:28.083
Mandy ain't one! Hit the town!

10:28.166 --> 10:29.708

10:29.791 --> 10:32.166
Make her stay with Mum!
Sim, what's your sell-by date?

10:32.958 --> 10:35.791
You ain't had a date
since the end of Myspace.

10:35.875 --> 10:37.291
You forgot how rum tastes.

10:37.375 --> 10:40.375
Burning throat's not a taste.
Mandy needs a stable place.

10:40.458 --> 10:42.541
And if I'm off my face looking wasted--

10:42.625 --> 10:44.458
Then Mum will take your place, bae.

10:47.583 --> 10:49.458

10:49.541 --> 10:52.291
Ten sips, free drinks,
last drinks in the rave.

12:01.625 --> 12:02.750

12:04.000 --> 12:05.208
It's good to see you.

This... on the house.

12:07.791 --> 12:08.916
Thanks, Barney.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.708

- I can't. I got some things to do.

12:16.791 --> 12:18.041

- Sorry.

12:18.125 --> 12:19.958
I miss our deep chats, man.

12:20.041 --> 12:20.916
Long time.

- Thank you.

12:33.458 --> 12:34.708
You're welcome.

12:35.958 --> 12:37.666
Finish up, let's head round the corner.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.625
Round the corner, where?

12:40.916 --> 12:43.208
- Jake's.
- No. You said you hate Jake's.

12:43.291 --> 12:45.916
- Yeah, I do, but I'm horny.
- Yvonne.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.208

12:47.291 --> 12:49.708

Been away.

14:56.458 --> 14:59.041

15:08.416 --> 15:09.791
That's not my drooling.

15:10.333 --> 15:11.166
I'm going in.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.750
Oh, hi... Wow!

15:17.833 --> 15:20.333
I saw you come through and I just thought

15:21.208 --> 15:24.791
I don't wanna spend the rest of my night
wondering what if. You know?

15:32.083 --> 15:32.958
Oh, yes.

15:34.041 --> 15:36.458
Barney, where are the draughts?

15:39.791 --> 15:42.250
She likes draughts.

15:45.416 --> 15:48.291
Shall we play some draughts?
Hold this, I'll clear the table.

15:48.375 --> 15:50.208
I love you. I love you.

15:50.291 --> 15:52.333
Don't leave! Stay here.
Just stay here. Okay?

15:52.416 --> 15:55.666
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
I will be back in 20 minutes!

15:55.750 --> 15:58.583
Okay, Barney. Bye, Barney!

16:13.541 --> 16:16.000
- What you looking at?
- I'm just looking, innit?

16:16.083 --> 16:18.083
Don't look at me, all right?

16:18.166 --> 16:20.500
Relax and settle yourself,
you little child!

16:21.916 --> 16:25.291
Hold this. And this.
Don't nick nothing, though!

16:25.375 --> 16:27.708
- Come here. No, come here!
- No, leave it.

16:27.791 --> 16:29.833
- Where you going?
- You don't wanna start this.

16:29.916 --> 16:31.125
Look at you, you little smurf.

16:31.208 --> 16:33.375
- Come here. Don't talk. Act.
- Don't start with me.

16:33.458 --> 16:35.583
- You not gonna go light?
- What you got, bruh?

16:44.083 --> 16:46.125
Dickhead. Oh, thank you!

16:47.000 --> 16:48.666
- I think I get free entry for that.
- Yes.

16:48.750 --> 16:50.166
Oh, thanks, guys.

16:50.625 --> 16:51.875
Party!

16:53.083 --> 16:54.166
I am black.

16:54.875 --> 16:56.166
White.

16:56.791 --> 16:57.750
Are you ready to lose?

16:58.208 --> 17:01.375
I don't wanna brag or anything,
but I am an absolute demon at this game.

17:01.458 --> 17:04.790
Is that where you got those biceps from,
all that draughts practice?

17:04.875 --> 17:06.375
- You noticed?
- Mmm.

17:08.415 --> 17:09.540
It's all in the first move.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.958
That's not the rules.

17:15.458 --> 17:17.458
'Cause it gives me... this. Thank you.

17:17.540 --> 17:19.790
That was-- You're very good at this game.

17:19.875 --> 17:22.915
I think you're just a bit distracted.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.625
- I am, as well.
- Yeah, you definitely are.

17:25.708 --> 17:27.750
Fieldgate Primary School.
I used to go there.

17:27.833 --> 17:30.208
I bet we know some people in common.

17:30.291 --> 17:32.208
Yeah, I bet we don't.

17:32.291 --> 17:36.083
- Wow, that is a beautiful smile.
- Oh, thank you.

17:36.166 --> 17:37.791
- It's a gorgeous smile.
- Thank you.

17:37.875 --> 17:39.291
I do allow myself the odd one.

17:39.375 --> 17:40.208
Odd one?

17:40.291 --> 17:43.666
Yeah! At Christmas, birthdays, Easter...

17:43.750 --> 17:45.500
I'm honored to be here
n this rare occasion,

17:45.583 --> 17:47.625
but I got to say,
you should smile more than that.

17:47.708 --> 17:48.875

Hmm. Not long out either.
What? A couple of days? A week?

Come on, let's get up. Let's go.

22:43.166 --> 22:44.166
Hi.

22:53.625 --> 22:55.125
I didn't get your name.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.083
Raymond.

22:58.166 --> 22:59.125

23:00.166 --> 23:01.916
Nice to meet you. My name's Simone.

23:03.583 --> 23:04.750
Good to meet you.

23:07.083 --> 23:08.833
Your first night out.
Where are your friends?

23:08.916 --> 23:11.500
That is a good question.
I don't know where they are.

23:11.583 --> 23:13.666
- Wow.
- They're grown up, they're busy.

23:13.750 --> 23:15.333
Families, kids, and stuff.

23:15.416 --> 23:16.291
Busy.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.375
Look.

23:23.250 --> 23:25.208
I don't even know
why I'm saying this, but...

23:26.083 --> 23:28.291
I wasn't violent, okay?

23:28.375 --> 23:30.333
I mean, I wasn't violent,
I was just stupid.

23:30.416 --> 23:33.250
- That's how I ended up in prison, end of.
- Yeah, okay.

23:33.333 --> 23:36.875
To be honest, I was hoping it would be
a bit more dramatic, a little bit more...

23:37.166 --> 23:38.750
"I was head of mafia gang camp."

23:43.666 --> 23:44.666
You're funny.

23:46.625 --> 23:48.041
Put your number in my phone.

23:50.291 --> 23:51.125
Okay.

23:53.708 --> 23:55.125
- Shall I call myself?
- No.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.916
- Getting off now?
- Yeah, that's why I pressed the bell.

24:04.333 --> 24:05.166
Sorry.

24:07.041 --> 24:08.250
You're very handsome.

24:09.041 --> 24:11.416
You're... freaking gorgeous!

You have a beautiful family.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.375
- Thank you.
- Bro...

27:09.833 --> 27:11.708
You could have come visit.

27:11.791 --> 27:13.291
Lot of things you could have done.

27:18.833 --> 27:19.875
I'm sorry I didn't.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.666
Like I never made it to a visit.

27:27.791 --> 27:29.458
- How's it going work-wise?
- It's all right.

27:29.541 --> 27:32.708
- Got some street cleansing thing.
- What?

27:32.791 --> 27:34.125
Street cleansing.

27:34.208 --> 27:37.000
Do they like...
give you one of those vehicles?

27:37.083 --> 27:41.875
I understand the job does entail
a number of... carts and vehicles, yeah.

27:41.958 --> 27:43.958
Don't laugh. You're a dickhead.

27:44.333 --> 27:45.166
Oh.

27:46.416 --> 27:47.250
That's good.

27:47.875 --> 27:49.833
You need the money. It's good.

27:49.916 --> 27:51.833
Listen, job don't start till tomorrow.

27:52.708 --> 27:55.166
Well, the christening's done,
you didn't make me godfather.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.166
But I'm willing to let that slide if...

27:58.458 --> 28:00.250
after this... go home.

28:00.333 --> 28:03.583
Go on the prowl, ninja style. Could still
walk you through a cold-blood maneuver.

28:03.666 --> 28:04.708
No, I can't.

28:04.791 --> 28:07.166
You don't have to do anything.
Just come with, be my wingman.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.750
It's my daughter's christening.

28:09.208 --> 28:11.083
I just moved back in with Artemis.

28:11.708 --> 28:13.375
I gotta prove it to her.

28:13.458 --> 28:14.333
Prove it to her?

28:15.708 --> 28:17.291
- You're the dad.
- Yeah?

28:17.958 --> 28:18.791
That's enough, innit?

28:18.875 --> 28:21.916
How long you gonna act like this for?
Till you're like 40? 50?

28:22.375 --> 28:24.666
Look, I gotta get back
to my daughter's christening.

28:24.750 --> 28:26.875
Make sure you come say bye
before you leave, yeah?

28:52.125 --> 28:53.833
There you go. Hold on a minute.

28:56.333 --> 28:58.833
Put your hand there. Then you sweep.

29:00.041 --> 29:01.583
You can do it all day.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.208
Good afternoon.
We are court-appointed bailiffs.

29:30.833 --> 29:34.458
- And are you Mr. Barney Bickerstaff?
- Yeah.

29:36.125 --> 29:39.125
We're here regarding
an unpaid council tax fine.

29:39.625 --> 29:41.125
This place is legend.

29:41.541 --> 29:43.833
- Are you the owner?
- Actually, my dad left it to me.

29:43.916 --> 29:47.583
It used to be ram up.
I had some magical times in this gaff.

29:47.958 --> 29:49.958
Uh, did you receive the invoice, sir?

29:50.041 --> 29:52.833
£820, including costs.

29:53.500 --> 29:54.750
You can have what I've got.

29:54.833 --> 29:59.416
I'm going to carry out a possessions
inventory for the amount of £820.

30:00.083 --> 30:01.791
Minus the cash, of course.

30:01.875 --> 30:04.958
And then remove goods for that amount.

30:05.750 --> 30:06.916
You sign here.

30:09.958 --> 30:12.375
Um, sorry.
Could I have a look at that chair?

30:17.916 --> 30:20.458
Don't know. Don't know.
About a fiver each? A tenner?

30:20.541 --> 30:21.458
Yeah.

30:35.041 --> 30:37.291
- Yeah, I know it's important.
- Gotta get stuff done.

30:37.375 --> 30:39.916
- Sent my CV to everyone.
- You done it?

30:40.000 --> 30:42.458
Stapled my prison release form
to the back and everything.

30:42.541 --> 30:45.750
- Are you serious right now? You're mad.
- That was a joke, Mother, calm down.

30:45.833 --> 30:46.833
Don't mess about.

30:46.916 --> 30:49.541
Sometimes your head is gone.
I don't know where your head is.

30:49.625 --> 30:51.916
- Focus and do what you need to do. What?
- Mum?

30:52.000 --> 30:54.500
I'm just getting some messages
through. It might be about work.

30:54.583 --> 30:56.958
What messages? About who?
Oh, you are such a liar.

30:57.041 --> 30:58.750
Yes, I am lying to you, but I love you.

30:58.833 --> 30:59.958
Oh, yeah.

31:28.708 --> 31:30.458
How was it having Grandma babysit?

31:33.083 --> 31:34.958
I think you turned out pretty well,
considering.

31:35.041 --> 31:36.041
Hey!

31:36.125 --> 31:37.458
Have some respect.

31:37.541 --> 31:39.041
I know, but it's the truth!

31:39.125 --> 31:41.875
Yeah, well, I think you turned out
pretty well, considering.

31:43.666 --> 31:45.416
You're a great mum.

31:45.500 --> 31:46.750
Yeah.

31:47.833 --> 31:50.541
It's me and you, baby...
against the world.

32:04.416 --> 32:06.833
- I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.
- You'll have to move it.

32:06.916 --> 32:10.458
No, no, no. I'm sorry, madam. This is
the optimal position for monitoring.

32:10.541 --> 32:13.250
I can't have that
in the middle of my prayer meetings!

32:13.333 --> 32:15.625
Well, you move it again,
it'll trigger further responses!

32:15.708 --> 32:18.291
Well, of course I'm gonna have to move it.

32:18.375 --> 32:20.708
How can I clean it without moving it?

32:20.791 --> 32:22.000
Who's your manager?

32:22.083 --> 32:24.791
- This is what I was talking about.
- You do the crime...

32:24.875 --> 32:26.250
but I pay the price!

32:26.333 --> 32:29.250
It's like he thinks there's some kind
of free ride in this world.

32:30.250 --> 32:32.333
I am wearied by this. I'm tired.

32:32.416 --> 32:34.541
You know, he was a heavy baby.

32:34.625 --> 32:36.750
I spent 20 hours in labor with him.

32:36.833 --> 32:38.458
- Really?
- Why? Because his head's so big.

32:38.541 --> 32:39.458
Hello?

32:40.500 --> 32:41.666
Tomorrow night.

32:41.750 --> 32:43.291
I'm available tomorrow night.

32:43.375 --> 32:45.166
Don't come with no expectations.

32:45.250 --> 32:46.416
No, no, no, I won't.

32:48.250 --> 32:49.875
Do you even know who this is?

32:49.958 --> 32:52.375
Of course I know who this is.
Simone, right?

32:52.458 --> 32:53.291
Good.

32:53.375 --> 32:54.416
Eight o'clock.

32:55.083 --> 32:56.500
Can we make it 6:30?

32:57.500 --> 32:58.333
Okay.

32:59.541 --> 33:00.416
Good.

33:04.333 --> 33:05.208
Shit.

33:09.083 --> 33:10.250
Star &amp; Garter.

33:18.083 --> 33:19.125
Have a good one!

33:19.541 --> 33:20.916
Come on!

33:23.000 --> 33:24.541
Woo!

33:24.625 --> 33:27.125
- Food time!
- Can we get kebabs?

33:33.708 --> 33:34.833
Hey.

33:36.208 --> 33:37.041
Who's this?

33:38.041 --> 33:38.875
I'm Kestrel.

33:38.958 --> 33:40.416
Move from the kid.

33:41.083 --> 33:42.125
You've grown so big.

33:43.708 --> 33:45.500
I've got no right to call myself your dad.

33:46.416 --> 33:48.000
- But--
- What you doing here?

33:48.791 --> 33:49.625
Hmm?

33:50.791 --> 33:52.375
- Look, just--
- I was wondering, Mandy.

33:53.541 --> 33:55.041
I was wondering if, um...

33:58.041 --> 34:00.458
if you would like to spend
some time together.

34:00.541 --> 34:03.458
No. No, no, no, no, no. Definitely not.

34:15.833 --> 34:18.208
- Gotta say, man, Jake's is looking good.
- Thanks, man.

34:18.291 --> 34:20.958
You know, it was your dad
that inspired me.

34:22.916 --> 34:24.291
RIP and that.

34:24.375 --> 34:27.083
Yeah, but, you know... The moon waxes...

34:27.166 --> 34:28.625
and the moon wanes.

34:29.375 --> 34:32.416
You know? And then you pretty even
run out of waning.

34:36.958 --> 34:39.583
No, listen. Look. That's real.

34:39.666 --> 34:41.166
And I want you to have that.

34:45.791 --> 34:46.708
Yeah?

34:48.041 --> 34:49.166
What you gonna do with it?

34:49.833 --> 34:51.750
Jake's Dirty Pizza Lounge.

34:52.416 --> 34:53.583
Yeah, I've seen the future.

34:53.666 --> 34:55.625
Spelt crusts and fit birds.

34:56.333 --> 34:57.958
Don't tell me you don't want none of that.

34:58.458 --> 35:00.791
See, that's the mistake you made
with this place.

35:01.333 --> 35:02.416
You know, all this...

35:03.666 --> 35:04.666
community shit.

35:05.166 --> 35:07.041
Cheap food for the elders and that.

35:07.541 --> 35:08.375
Nah!

35:08.458 --> 35:10.708
People don't want inclusivity, mate.

35:11.125 --> 35:14.416
They want exclusivity.
And something for the gluten intolerant.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.375
So, do you wanna celebrate?

35:30.958 --> 35:32.416
- Hi.
- Hey.

35:32.500 --> 35:33.958
Sorry, I...

35:34.041 --> 35:35.500
I didn't know.

35:35.583 --> 35:37.833
It doesn't mention the crackheads
who fight here nightly.

35:37.916 --> 35:40.916
Look, this property comes
with regular morning performances

35:41.000 --> 35:42.333
from a local street artist.

35:42.416 --> 35:43.666
Every morning.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.708
The city died when we wasn't looking.

35:47.416 --> 35:48.666
Do you like ungentrified food?

35:50.041 --> 35:52.125
I love ungentrified food.

35:52.208 --> 35:53.541
- This way.
- Thank you.

35:53.625 --> 35:55.916
- You look lovely!
- Thank you.

35:56.750 --> 35:57.750
You too.

35:57.833 --> 35:59.125
Smells good in here, no?

35:59.208 --> 36:00.083
Really does.

36:01.500 --> 36:02.875
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

36:02.958 --> 36:05.125
Nibble bits are on the house.
Have you guys been before?

36:05.208 --> 36:07.166
- I've been here before.
- I haven't.

36:07.250 --> 36:09.416
- Have a read at the menu.
- Okay, thank you.

36:09.875 --> 36:11.416
I'm a pig, sorry.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.041
Wow! Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

36:13.125 --> 36:15.416
They do really good, uh, smoothies
here as well.

36:15.500 --> 36:16.833
- Yeah?
- I recommend this one.

36:16.916 --> 36:18.500
Mango, tamarind, ginger.

36:19.166 --> 36:20.708
That's got milk. I don't drink milk.

36:21.583 --> 36:24.500
- Why not? What's wrong with milk?
- I'm just not a baby cow, so...

36:25.458 --> 36:27.875
You're one of those Star &amp; Garter people.

36:27.958 --> 36:30.500
You're one of those vegan, no gluten,
no nothing--

36:30.583 --> 36:32.833
How dare you compare-- No.

36:32.916 --> 36:35.125
- I am... I'm just healthy.
- Yeah?

36:35.208 --> 36:37.416
Star &amp; Garter. That's fucking blasphemous.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.041
- Know what I'm eating?
- What you eating?

36:39.125 --> 36:41.666
- I'm eating this meat platter.
- Oh, meat.

36:42.791 --> 36:44.416
Man must eat meat.

36:45.750 --> 36:47.958
- It's good protein!
- Man must eat protein.

36:48.041 --> 36:50.416
Don't you want like a big strong guy
to look after you?

36:50.500 --> 36:52.750
Ah, you know, I'm pretty strong myself.

36:52.833 --> 36:55.041
- Been taking care of me for a while now.
- All right.

36:55.125 --> 36:57.208
Just offering.

36:57.291 --> 36:59.791
Oh. So where are you from anyway?

36:59.875 --> 37:01.375
I'm from the wild, wild west.

37:01.458 --> 37:03.708
So, is that... is that in... the UK?

37:03.791 --> 37:04.750
Kilburn.

37:04.833 --> 37:06.958
Oh, wow! That's the west where it's wild.

37:07.041 --> 37:07.958
AKA wild, wild--

37:08.041 --> 37:10.208
Kill... as in Kil-burn.

37:10.291 --> 37:12.708
- That's why they call it-- Wow!
- Wild, wild west.

37:15.166 --> 37:16.166
Amazing.

37:21.916 --> 37:23.208
Sexy ankle bracelet.

37:23.291 --> 37:25.708
Yeah, it's one of those new smartwatches.

37:25.791 --> 37:29.125
That is... exactly something
my daughter would say.

37:29.208 --> 37:30.375
I take that as a compliment.

37:32.583 --> 37:33.416
You got kids?

37:34.000 --> 37:35.083
No.

37:35.166 --> 37:37.250
You don't... think you do.

37:38.625 --> 37:39.541
Watch it.

37:42.291 --> 37:43.583
So, can I ask?

37:44.583 --> 37:45.791
What did you do?

37:47.541 --> 37:49.291
- It was going so well.
- Sorry!

37:49.375 --> 37:52.083
Nah, it's all right. I can tell you, um...

37:53.291 --> 37:54.166
I was silly.

37:54.958 --> 37:56.791
I was an idiot. I was unlucky.

37:57.083 --> 37:59.916
I was walking out of the pub,
ten o'clock, I see this mate of mine.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.916
And he says,
"Come back to mine for a smoke."

38:03.000 --> 38:05.916
And in retrospect,
I probably should have been checking

38:06.000 --> 38:08.666
for this brother's juddery demeanor,
his general drunkenness,

38:08.750 --> 38:10.291
and he had this strange look in his eye.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.458
But at the time I said, "Cool, let's go."

38:12.541 --> 38:14.416
And we walked past this silver car,

38:14.500 --> 38:18.000
and he notices this laptop
in the back seat.

38:18.083 --> 38:19.416
- Mm-hmm.
- So, he just...

38:19.500 --> 38:21.750
tries his luck and tries to open the door,

38:21.833 --> 38:24.208
and he goes, "It's open," so he goes in.

38:25.333 --> 38:28.083
Before I can stop him, he's all looking
in the glove box and stuff.

38:28.166 --> 38:31.500
And lo and behold, what he finds
is a wad of cash, a bag of pills,

38:31.583 --> 38:33.291
and a bag of coke.

38:33.375 --> 38:36.333
And so he decides,
being the man that he is,

38:36.416 --> 38:38.916
to snort a considerable amount
of that coke.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.083
And um, yeah, madness ensued.
It wasn't coke, it was ketamine.

38:42.166 --> 38:44.125
- No.
- Yeah. So he's in the car,

38:44.208 --> 38:46.333
he's losing his shit,
he's all high as a kite.

38:46.416 --> 38:48.916
And he accidentally locks himself
in the car.

38:49.333 --> 38:51.625
Then what happens next is he knocks
the CD player

38:51.708 --> 38:53.375
and the music starts blaring out.

38:53.458 --> 38:55.041
And so here's where I get involved.

38:55.125 --> 38:57.333
Because of me being the man I am,

38:57.958 --> 39:00.833
you know, I decided to do
the selfless thing, you know,

39:00.916 --> 39:03.500
and, um, to try and help him
out of the car.

39:03.916 --> 39:05.541
I give the window a little nudge.

39:05.625 --> 39:08.625
It completely shatters because
I'm a strong guy. That's no secret, yeah?

39:09.125 --> 39:10.791
And as I'm pulling him out,

39:10.875 --> 39:13.916
that's when the Feds come weaving
round the corner.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.541
They see me. I'm half in the car.

39:15.625 --> 39:17.541
I'm like, "Officer, it's not
what it looks like."

39:17.625 --> 39:19.375
And they're like, "It probably is, mate.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.333
Put your hands on the car."

39:21.416 --> 39:24.166
That's the long and short of it.
Pretty much how it went down.

39:24.250 --> 39:26.625
- You sure you don't want to... try this?
- Wow.

39:26.708 --> 39:27.583
God, I mean...

39:28.083 --> 39:28.916
Wow.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.625
- Wow. That's what I said.
- Yeah.

39:30.708 --> 39:34.708
I was like, if that's what's happening
to a good Samaritan like me, then...

39:34.791 --> 39:35.625
Sick world.

39:35.708 --> 39:37.125
That is some bullshit.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.083
I know.

39:38.625 --> 39:40.458
That whole story is bullshit.

39:41.916 --> 39:43.000
You're chatting shit.

39:43.625 --> 39:44.458
Yeah?

39:45.291 --> 39:46.125
Bullshit.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.875
That's the truth. God's honest truth.

39:51.416 --> 39:53.458
Okay, maybe I wanted
a little bit of that money.

39:53.541 --> 39:55.291
- Right.
- I mean, it was free money.

39:55.375 --> 39:57.375
You know, can you blame me?

39:57.458 --> 39:59.375
It's not as if I was
like robbing from a saint.

39:59.458 --> 40:02.125
It was clearly from a bad place,
or whatever.

40:02.208 --> 40:04.375
So, yeah... And I got unlucky, as well.

40:04.458 --> 40:06.833
Because when the coppers came,
they searched the car,

40:06.916 --> 40:09.666
there was 20 grand in the boot,
and some weapons and stuff,

40:09.750 --> 40:11.875
our fingerprints all over
this stolen car.

40:12.333 --> 40:15.625
So I was awarded three years
at Her Majesty's pleasure.

40:15.708 --> 40:17.416
And given this... thing.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.333
Yeah. A souvenir.

40:20.083 --> 40:21.416
Yeah, something like that.

40:22.250 --> 40:23.083
Where's your mate?

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
He's in a galaxy far, far away.

40:26.083 --> 40:27.666
It was a big error of judgment.

40:28.166 --> 40:31.833
And are you prone to making
errors of judgment?

40:32.625 --> 40:33.875
I dunno.

40:33.958 --> 40:35.083
So what do you do now?

40:35.625 --> 40:38.125
What do you wanna do?
Career? Employment?

40:38.208 --> 40:39.583
You have a lot of questions.

40:39.666 --> 40:41.666
I'm sorry. I've just met you.

40:43.416 --> 40:44.583
Fair enough.

40:47.333 --> 40:49.541
I have a job. Yeah.

40:49.625 --> 40:50.583
Like everyone else.

40:50.666 --> 40:51.583
What do you do?

40:54.833 --> 40:56.958
You know how you don't mean to ask
a woman her age?

40:58.166 --> 41:01.625
Um, is this...
is this really one of those--

41:01.708 --> 41:03.458
This is one of those questions.

41:03.541 --> 41:04.833
- Okay.
- Yeah.

41:04.916 --> 41:06.541
I mean, when a guy is fresh out of prison,

41:06.625 --> 41:09.750
you're not meant to ask how he makes
a living and where he's living.

41:09.833 --> 41:11.750
That's just-- you don't ask.

41:12.458 --> 41:13.625
- Noted.
- Good.

41:13.708 --> 41:14.625
Noted.

41:15.833 --> 41:16.916
So where do you live?

41:17.250 --> 41:19.000
That's your last question of the evening.

41:19.083 --> 41:21.541
Yes, Your Honor, it is my last question.

41:23.833 --> 41:25.750
- I live at home with my mum.
- Where's your dad?

41:28.250 --> 41:30.041
My dad died when I was little.

41:31.500 --> 41:32.500
Sorry.

41:32.958 --> 41:33.791
It's all right.

41:34.583 --> 41:37.666
I had to kill him, he was out of control.

41:37.750 --> 41:40.708
Maybe that's why you went to prison.
Murder.

41:41.291 --> 41:42.708
You haven't eaten anything.

41:42.791 --> 41:43.625
No...

41:45.625 --> 41:46.541
Not hungry?

41:48.500 --> 41:49.500
Not as much.

41:58.375 --> 42:00.375
- You can get something to go.
- Let's get it to go.

42:00.458 --> 42:01.333
Excuse me!

42:01.958 --> 42:04.041
Um, can we get this
in a takeaway box, please?

42:06.375 --> 42:09.125
We didn't buy anything. That's so rude.

42:09.208 --> 42:11.000
We can leave, like, a big tip.

42:16.250 --> 42:19.416
You know, I used to think
this hill wasn't for people like me.

42:20.500 --> 42:21.541
A hill is a hill.

42:22.666 --> 42:24.333
It don't belong to no one person.

42:28.083 --> 42:29.916
Why don't you come a bit closer?

42:31.333 --> 42:32.250
What for?

42:33.375 --> 42:34.875
What do you mean, "what for"?

42:37.416 --> 42:38.916
You've gone all shy.

42:40.000 --> 42:40.875
Shy.

42:40.958 --> 42:41.958
Yeah.

42:48.208 --> 42:49.333
I have, as well.

44:01.625 --> 44:02.750
Where's your mum?

44:03.958 --> 44:05.125
Working nights.

44:06.291 --> 44:07.416
She's a midwife.

44:10.166 --> 44:11.000
Wait.

44:12.041 --> 44:13.541
You don't think I'm that easy?

44:16.500 --> 44:17.333
Got you.

44:18.708 --> 44:20.375
It'd be a pleasure to have you around.

44:21.333 --> 44:23.041
- For tea.
- For tea.

44:23.125 --> 44:24.333
- Uh-huh.
- Just tea.

44:28.916 --> 44:31.708
- Evening, is that Raymond Legendre?
- Yeah, it is. Hi.

44:31.791 --> 44:35.000
Yeah, it's showing in the system
you're two minutes late for curfew.

44:35.583 --> 44:37.958

Get out the shower! Come on!

51:42.500 --> 51:44.875
I've got maths club!
Ben's gonna be waiting! Mum!

51:45.333 --> 51:47.083
I'm tired.
My feet are sore.

51:47.166 --> 51:50.625
Mum! We need to leave now
Right now.

51:51.083 --> 51:52.375
What's in my lunchbox?

51:52.458 --> 51:55.333
Well, madam,
today we have the tuna tartare.

51:56.541 --> 51:58.083
Hello.

51:58.875 --> 51:59.958
Hello.

52:00.666 --> 52:01.625
Um...

52:02.541 --> 52:04.125
I'll introduce myself, then. Hello!

52:08.000 --> 52:09.875
- I came to give you this. Cool.
- Thank you.

52:09.958 --> 52:12.125
- Why have you got my mum's bangle?
- Don't ask questions.

52:12.208 --> 52:15.333
I'm, uh, your mum's mate.
Mate, as in "friend."

52:15.416 --> 52:16.791
Thanks. Good to see you.

52:16.875 --> 52:18.583
Okay. Good to see you. Take care.

52:21.125 --> 52:22.333
- Okay.
- Yup.

52:22.416 --> 52:23.291
Bye.

52:23.916 --> 52:25.583
- You know. I just came to give you--
- Yup.

52:27.375 --> 52:28.208
Okay.

52:28.791 --> 52:29.625
Bye.

52:34.500 --> 52:36.875
Mummy's got a boyfriend.

52:36.958 --> 52:37.791
Excuse me!

52:38.916 --> 52:41.583
Do you think that's smart,
talking to me like that?

52:41.666 --> 52:44.708
- That's very disrespectful, understand?
- Why are you being so weird?

52:44.791 --> 52:48.916
Don't ask me why I'm being weird. I'm not
your friend at school. It's very rude.

52:49.666 --> 52:50.875
Go to school. Go on.

53:35.166 --> 53:36.666
- Stay for a second.
- I need to work.

53:36.750 --> 53:38.791
- Well, can I see you again?
- What?

53:39.291 --> 53:42.625
Can I see you again? Without the sex.
Just me and you, hanging.

53:44.166 --> 53:45.166
I'll think about it.

53:55.416 --> 53:58.583
Who is it, huh,
against the whole wide world?

53:59.541 --> 54:00.666
Me and you.

54:01.208 --> 54:03.041
Exactly. It is me and you.

54:03.958 --> 54:05.083
Hi, Simone.

54:05.166 --> 54:07.958
Um, it would be lovely to see you again.

54:08.041 --> 54:09.500
So, uh yeah.

54:10.000 --> 54:10.833
Bye.

54:14.833 --> 54:19.166
Call him now. Don't you want
more of that sweet chocolate?

54:19.250 --> 54:20.583
What's your problem?

54:20.666 --> 54:24.125
I don't know. What if he's just...
playing games, innit?

54:24.208 --> 54:27.250
Babes, games are fun!
What are you afraid of?

54:27.333 --> 54:29.875
Getting cavities?
Or have you got diabetes?

54:29.958 --> 54:31.083
Simone? Sim--

54:41.416 --> 54:43.958
You know what? I didn't like babies,
but I do now because of you.

54:44.041 --> 54:47.833
One problem though. I don't understand
what they're saying. Sort of like women.

54:48.583 --> 54:51.500
You've got to... think of it
from her point of view.

54:51.583 --> 54:53.375
You're not exactly a catch,

54:53.458 --> 54:56.791
with your fresh out of prison,
still living with your mother vibe.

54:57.416 --> 54:58.250
It's...

54:59.166 --> 55:00.541
It's hardly what girls dream about.

55:00.625 --> 55:03.875
Girls don't dream about this, yeah?
I got my own car.

55:03.958 --> 55:06.958
Why, this is sexy, you know?
Let me tell you about this car.

55:07.041 --> 55:11.291
When I'm coming, I can let them know
by just-- a little beep. See that?

55:11.375 --> 55:12.500
See? She responded.

55:12.916 --> 55:14.833
This one is the lights on the top.

55:14.916 --> 55:16.291
When I'm cruising down,

55:16.375 --> 55:18.833
all the mummies run out of the cafes
and they're like,

55:18.916 --> 55:21.000
"There he goes again, Raymond Legendre!"

55:21.083 --> 55:22.916
It's mad. It's mental.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.041
Have you finished? You're deflecting.

55:28.250 --> 55:29.166
You're deflecting.

55:29.250 --> 55:32.000
This is why I don't have girlfriends.
Too much stress.

55:32.625 --> 55:34.166
Uncle Raymond's deflecting.

55:34.750 --> 55:35.583
Hmm?

55:43.375 --> 55:44.333
Hi, Yvonne.

55:45.875 --> 55:47.500
It's second floor, on the right.

55:49.708 --> 55:51.541
Hey! Listen.

55:51.625 --> 55:54.333
If your mum finds out about this,
we're both screwed, you get me?

55:54.416 --> 55:55.875
This is about me.

55:56.416 --> 55:59.166
Either you come with me,
or I do it alone.

56:00.416 --> 56:03.250
I'm doing it. Pass my crutches.

56:19.708 --> 56:20.833
Go on, then.

56:20.916 --> 56:21.750
Well done.

56:22.291 --> 56:23.333
Well done.

56:27.916 --> 56:29.250
Come on, babe.

56:29.333 --> 56:30.416
Hi.

56:36.041 --> 56:36.916
Mandy.

56:39.541 --> 56:40.791
What are you staring at?

56:55.250 --> 56:58.750
I didn't really know what you like,
so, um, I've got us crisps and...

56:58.833 --> 57:00.333
sweets... as well.

57:00.666 --> 57:03.583
It's gonna take a little bit more
than biscuits and sweets.

57:08.416 --> 57:09.291
How are you?

57:11.000 --> 57:12.833
- Do you dislike me?
- No.

57:15.416 --> 57:16.250
Why'd you ask?

57:16.333 --> 57:18.541
You've haven't spent one minute with me
before today.

57:19.041 --> 57:19.958
That's cause, um...

57:20.625 --> 57:22.000
That's cause I've been an idiot.

57:42.458 --> 57:43.708
You all right, ladies?

57:43.791 --> 57:46.291
Hey, baby.
You have fun at Auntie Vonnie's?

57:48.750 --> 57:50.625
What's wrong? What?

57:50.708 --> 57:53.000
Why didn't you tell me
Dad lived down the road?

58:06.750 --> 58:09.875
I mean, she was gonna go without me.
You know what she's like. She's...

58:09.958 --> 58:12.625
confident and outspoken,
and that's amazing.

58:14.750 --> 58:19.125
I mean, you weren't there. He didn't look
all that bad. He kinda looked... good.

58:19.666 --> 58:21.541
It was the wrong decision. I...

58:27.833 --> 58:28.875
This is, um...

58:30.625 --> 58:32.500
- This is my problem.
- Yeah.

About Dad.

01:06:20.791 --> 01:06:21.625
No.

01:06:23.166 --> 01:06:25.375
No, he left us! He left us.

I met lots of people.

01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:36.541

- Too much.
- Did you ever love anyone else?

01:06:52.333 --> 01:06:55.625
Oh, I love you. And I love Mandy. But--

01:06:57.458 --> 01:06:59.333

- Nothing. Just take my place.

01:07:23.041 --> 01:07:24.291

01:07:28.041 --> 01:07:29.416

the man who now holds her, like a soldier.

01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:26.166
A brave soldier.

01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:29.958
I'm gonna slice the man, dice the man,
I won't rest until I ice the man.

01:14:30.041 --> 01:14:32.958
Now violence inspires my blood
like a virus.

01:14:41.208 --> 01:14:43.833
My phone crashed.
I've been waiting for an upgrade.

01:14:45.208 --> 01:14:47.500
I ain't even gonna pick that lie apart.

01:14:48.333 --> 01:14:49.416
Look, come here.

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:52.875
No, I'd love to, but I need this package
dropped off in 30.

01:14:55.166 --> 01:14:56.375
So go do your job.

01:15:00.916 --> 01:15:01.750
All right.

01:15:40.916 --> 01:15:44.333
Hey. You all right?
What was so important, then?

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:47.500
We're going to play a game of pool.

01:15:48.041 --> 01:15:49.708
And a game...

01:15:50.666 --> 01:15:51.500
of truth.

01:15:51.583 --> 01:15:54.625
Okay, so, I've definitely never played
truth pool.

01:15:54.708 --> 01:15:56.291
You'll have to show me the ropes.

01:15:56.708 --> 01:15:58.125
Who's this? Your chaperone?

01:15:58.208 --> 01:16:00.458
No, I'm actually her maths partner.

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:04.708
There you go.

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:12.625
Okay, Dad. Truth.

01:16:13.541 --> 01:16:16.083
What exactly happened with you and Mum?

01:16:17.375 --> 01:16:19.791
Uh... you not got any easier ones?

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:21.208
No.

01:16:21.666 --> 01:16:24.333
Um, when me and your mum first
got together, we were--

01:16:24.416 --> 01:16:27.416
we were very young. We loved each other
very much. It was great.

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:30.791
When you get older, sometimes
it just doesn't work out, and...

01:16:30.875 --> 01:16:32.625
you have to live away from each other.

01:16:33.416 --> 01:16:34.250
He's lying.

01:16:35.625 --> 01:16:36.833
Yeah. You're lying.

01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:41.083
Okay. But the truth is... I was selfish.

01:16:41.791 --> 01:16:42.875
And I was an addict.

01:16:42.958 --> 01:16:46.625
Because I was selfish, I couldn't face
the responsibility of looking after you,

01:16:46.708 --> 01:16:47.541
so I ran away.

01:16:48.583 --> 01:16:49.416
Your shot.

01:16:54.958 --> 01:16:57.541
Mandy, what you doing here?
Where's your mum?

01:17:00.541 --> 01:17:03.958
- Who's this guy?
- This is Kestrel.

01:17:04.625 --> 01:17:05.625
My dad.

01:17:05.708 --> 01:17:06.583
Who's this?

01:17:07.666 --> 01:17:11.791
We're about to find out. Raymond, we're
playing a truth game and you're up next.

01:17:13.291 --> 01:17:15.375
- You wanna play?
- All right.

01:17:25.333 --> 01:17:26.625
What do you think of my mum?

01:17:28.333 --> 01:17:30.166
Kestrel is Mum's first love.

01:17:33.791 --> 01:17:36.666
So... reckon you've got a chance?

01:17:38.958 --> 01:17:39.875
She got barriers.

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:42.750
I messed up and she pushed me away.

01:17:46.375 --> 01:17:49.083
- Reckon you've got a chance?
- No, I blew it, mate.

01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:56.666
Are you in love with my mum?

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:34.416
How are you, Raymond Legendre?

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:37.333
Fine.

01:18:38.291 --> 01:18:41.166
I have waited so long
to have you in this position.

01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:42.666
What have I done to you?

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:46.041
I almost don't know what to do with you,
I'm so pleased with myself!

01:18:46.125 --> 01:18:48.291
Be reasonable! Hey, what's this all about?

01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:51.833
Just wondering what the best way is
to prolong your suffering.

01:18:52.666 --> 01:18:54.750
Get my full three years' worth.

01:18:54.833 --> 01:18:56.500

- You do know me.

01:19:18.208 --> 01:19:20.916
I watched you spellbind my woman
in front of me.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.916
And that's why you have to die.

01:19:26.666 --> 01:19:29.000
I'm gonna cut you until I can't see you.

01:19:29.083 --> 01:19:31.833
And when I can't see you,
I'm gonna cut what you was.

01:19:36.250 --> 01:19:37.666
Gimme a pull of that spliff.

01:19:39.291 --> 01:19:41.916
Mate, you're about to cut me up,
you can't give me two drags?

01:20:00.333 --> 01:20:01.750
You don't know what love is.

01:20:04.541 --> 01:20:06.750
To wake up
and see her face in the ceiling.

01:20:07.666 --> 01:20:09.416
To talk to her
even though she's not there.

01:20:09.833 --> 01:20:11.583
To want her to touch you so bad.

01:20:12.041 --> 01:20:14.625
To feel your heart burst with tenderness.

01:20:14.708 --> 01:20:17.000
- My love for her is mystical.
- Lyrical.

01:20:17.083 --> 01:20:18.500
Metaphysical, yeah.

01:20:23.208 --> 01:20:24.416
It's hell, isn't it?

01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:31.875
Stroke my hair like how my mum did.

01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:10.000
Okay if I leave him here?

01:21:15.541 --> 01:21:16.708
Mum?

01:21:16.791 --> 01:21:17.833
Mum!

01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:20.208
She's not in her room.

01:21:20.708 --> 01:21:22.666
- Listen, what?
- She's not in her room!

01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:24.125
- Mandy?
- Mandy!

01:21:24.208 --> 01:21:26.916
Why did you not call me if you were tired?
I would have come home.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.708
- She was in bed!
- Mandy! Mandy!

01:21:29.791 --> 01:21:31.458
Look! Where have you been?

01:21:31.541 --> 01:21:34.916
Mandy, why would you leave the house
without asking for permission?

01:21:35.666 --> 01:21:38.000
All you had to was wake her up
and say you wanna go out.

01:21:38.833 --> 01:21:41.458
It's not smart, Mandy,
it's not clever to do that.

01:21:41.541 --> 01:21:44.083
If someone takes your wheelchair,
how are you getting home?

01:21:44.166 --> 01:21:46.208
- She knows that.
- No, she obviously doesn't.

01:21:46.291 --> 01:21:47.458
That's why she left the house.

01:21:47.541 --> 01:21:50.750
- How could you be so stupid?
- I didn't want to turn out like you.

01:21:52.875 --> 01:21:55.708
- Why are you saying that to me?
- You push everyone away.

01:21:57.708 --> 01:22:00.166
Dad, Raymond, Auntie Vonnie.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.458
I don't push everybody away.
I don't push you away, do I?

01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:08.750
Sometimes you're scary.

01:22:10.416 --> 01:22:13.916
Baby, why would you say I'm scary?
I'm not trying to scare you.

01:22:14.375 --> 01:22:15.541
I'm trying to look after you.

01:22:15.958 --> 01:22:18.500
I don't want it to be just you and me
against the world.

01:22:18.583 --> 01:22:21.416
Auntie Vonnie took me to see Kestrel
because I made her.

01:22:22.208 --> 01:22:23.083
She loves me.

01:22:24.458 --> 01:22:25.666
And she loves you too.

01:22:32.208 --> 01:22:33.583
Okay. Okay.

01:22:37.416 --> 01:22:38.250
Okay.

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:44.500
- Can you watch her for a bit, please?
- Yeah.

01:22:45.583 --> 01:22:47.541
- Call his parents.
- Yeah.

01:22:50.666 --> 01:22:54.458
Have you, um...
have you pissed on the stick yet?

01:22:54.875 --> 01:22:55.708
I can't.

01:22:57.125 --> 01:22:58.958
What do you mean, you can't?

01:22:59.375 --> 01:23:00.333
I'm scared.

01:23:03.041 --> 01:23:04.666
I'm the fun girl. I'm not the...

01:23:05.208 --> 01:23:06.708
mum girl or the family girl.

01:23:06.791 --> 01:23:07.958
Who says?

01:23:08.625 --> 01:23:09.666
Hmm?

01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:11.458
It's not necessarily yours.

01:23:13.166 --> 01:23:14.000
Right.

01:23:14.833 --> 01:23:16.708
Ain't necessarily not mine.

01:23:17.958 --> 01:23:19.250
Let me know how it goes, yeah?

01:23:20.541 --> 01:23:21.875
I'm okay, Conrad.

01:23:21.958 --> 01:23:22.875
Conrad, okay!

01:23:22.958 --> 01:23:23.833
Okay, Conrad!

01:23:23.916 --> 01:23:25.416
Leave this woman--

01:23:26.833 --> 01:23:28.666
Look, I need... space.

01:23:29.666 --> 01:23:31.875
Let me know when you're done
with your space, yeah?

01:23:40.958 --> 01:23:42.291
Don't I know you?

01:23:43.541 --> 01:23:44.416
Oh...

01:23:44.916 --> 01:23:45.875
Fuck.

01:23:55.833 --> 01:23:56.666
Are you coming?

01:24:00.041 --> 01:24:02.833
I can't have a baby, Gil.

01:24:02.916 --> 01:24:04.500
It would fuck everything up.

01:24:05.166 --> 01:24:06.375
What's it gonna fuck up?

01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:09.000
My self-defeating patterns.

01:24:09.083 --> 01:24:11.250
- What do you mean?
- The good time has to stop.

01:24:11.333 --> 01:24:12.750
Why stop if it's a good time?

01:24:12.833 --> 01:24:15.083
Don't know. What do you like to do
that you don't anymore?

01:24:15.166 --> 01:24:16.916
- I don't do it any more.
- Exactly.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.708
Yeah. if I have a baby,
that's what they'll do to me.

01:24:19.791 --> 01:24:21.500
- What?
- That's what the baby will do to me.

01:24:21.583 --> 01:24:24.250
- The baby'll hunt you with a kebab knife?
- Huh?

01:24:24.333 --> 01:24:26.208
- That's what I don't do.
- What?

01:24:26.291 --> 01:24:29.625
No, I don't want to talk about it,
but there's things I've stopped doing.

01:24:32.250 --> 01:24:36.083
But we need to find an answer, and only
your piss will give us that answer.

01:24:36.916 --> 01:24:38.875
Would you hold my hand
while I piss on this stick?

01:24:38.958 --> 01:24:41.625
Yeah, I can hold your hand
while you piss on that stick.

01:24:41.708 --> 01:24:44.208
Look how you're smiling.
You're a fucking pervert.

01:24:44.791 --> 01:24:45.666
Don't move!

01:25:02.625 --> 01:25:04.125
- So?
- What?

01:25:05.250 --> 01:25:06.375
Are you a mum?

01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:08.750
Are you pregnant?

01:25:10.541 --> 01:25:11.416
Oh, man.

01:25:11.916 --> 01:25:13.125
Shit.

01:25:15.375 --> 01:25:16.458
But are you pregnant?

01:25:17.916 --> 01:25:18.833
So, wait...

01:25:19.875 --> 01:25:22.875
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I don't know what's the matter with me.

01:25:22.958 --> 01:25:26.375
Um, I'm not happy-- I'm not happy
because I'm supposed to be happy,

01:25:26.458 --> 01:25:28.958
but I'm not happy because I'm not happy,
you know?

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.500
You're not happy
because you're not pregnant.

01:25:31.583 --> 01:25:33.583
Yeah, I'm not happy
because I'm not pregnant. Yeah.

01:25:33.666 --> 01:25:35.125
So you wanted to be pregnant.

01:25:35.208 --> 01:25:37.041
Course not.
Who wants to be fucking pregnant?

01:25:37.125 --> 01:25:38.208
Lots of people.

01:25:38.791 --> 01:25:40.958
The baby would have been so fucking cute.

01:25:42.125 --> 01:25:43.041
'Cause I'm cute.

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:47.541
You're supposed to say
"Yeah, Yvonne you're cute."

01:25:47.625 --> 01:25:49.000
I wouldn't say you're cute.

01:25:50.041 --> 01:25:51.416
Cute's like small.

01:25:51.916 --> 01:25:53.541
I'd say you're more magnificent.

01:25:59.958 --> 01:26:00.791
Thanks.

01:26:02.458 --> 01:26:03.291
I like that.

01:26:04.041 --> 01:26:04.916
That's all right.

01:26:05.333 --> 01:26:06.500
I'm sorry I hit you.

01:26:07.291 --> 01:26:08.166
That's all right.

01:26:12.666 --> 01:26:13.666
I'll get over it.

01:26:20.291 --> 01:26:23.791
Do you know what cheers me up
when I'm feeling down? Come on.

01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:26.250
Oh, my coat!

01:26:37.041 --> 01:26:38.333
Is this what you want?

01:26:40.041 --> 01:26:41.583
Is this what you want?

01:26:50.208 --> 01:26:53.291
That's what it's about.
Just walking round...

01:26:53.833 --> 01:26:55.500
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!

01:27:00.833 --> 01:27:02.500
I got a new friend now.

01:27:04.791 --> 01:27:05.625
What?

01:27:07.208 --> 01:27:08.041
Hmm?

01:27:10.125 --> 01:27:12.166
I held your hand while you gave birth.

01:27:12.875 --> 01:27:15.708
And I rubbed that nipple cream
on your titties

01:27:15.791 --> 01:27:17.708
when they were sore from breastfeeding.

01:27:17.833 --> 01:27:19.750
I've rubbed cream on your titties.

01:27:20.833 --> 01:27:21.833
I'm sorry.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.083
Yvonne, I need you.

01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:29.000
No, I'm sorry.

01:27:29.083 --> 01:27:31.333
I should have asked,
I should have told you.

01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:34.583
I need you.

01:27:36.125 --> 01:27:38.875
- You look like you're crying, bro.
- Who's crying, bro? No one's crying.

01:27:38.958 --> 01:27:41.375
You? I don't know. I don't know.

01:27:41.666 --> 01:27:44.208
Don't cry. I'll slap you if you cry, bro.

01:27:44.291 --> 01:27:45.250
I'll slap you.

01:27:45.333 --> 01:27:47.250
I'll slap you in the face
with one of my tits.

01:27:48.375 --> 01:27:49.208
As if.

01:27:49.291 --> 01:27:51.416
Yeah, I could. They're saggy enough.

01:27:55.791 --> 01:27:56.791
Sorry.

01:27:58.541 --> 01:28:01.458
Don't come anywhere near me.
Stay away from me.

01:28:08.208 --> 01:28:09.333
What you gonna do now?

01:28:11.041 --> 01:28:11.875
I...

01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:14.333
am going to buy Mandy a kebab.

01:28:15.416 --> 01:28:16.250
What?

01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:17.625
- A kebab.
- Whoa!

01:28:19.291 --> 01:28:20.833
Oh, by the way, this is Gil.

01:28:21.916 --> 01:28:22.791
All right?

01:28:22.875 --> 01:28:23.708
Hmm.

01:28:24.125 --> 01:28:25.208
Mmm-mmm.

01:28:27.583 --> 01:28:28.750
- What?
- What are you doing?

01:28:28.833 --> 01:28:30.125
- I don't smell.
- Ew.

01:28:35.333 --> 01:28:37.833
Tequila. Please. Tequila. Now.

01:28:37.916 --> 01:28:39.208
- What's your name?
- Barney.

01:28:39.291 --> 01:28:41.625
Barney. Barney, please
can I have a tequila?

01:28:41.708 --> 01:28:42.875
I fucking hate men, Barney.

01:28:42.958 --> 01:28:45.666
You've come to the right place,
'cause there's none in here.

01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:46.583
Well...

01:28:51.041 --> 01:28:54.125
Where you been?
I texted your ass about a million times.

01:28:54.666 --> 01:28:56.208
Oh, I've been with Barney, babe.

01:28:59.083 --> 01:29:00.458
I like it.

01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:02.625
Yes. No queues in here, Dave.

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:04.958
Let's get everyone down here.

01:29:05.916 --> 01:29:06.750
Really?

01:29:20.083 --> 01:29:21.416
Thank you. Cheers, boss.

01:29:25.166 --> 01:29:28.666
Um... I guess it's, uh... it's Raymond.

01:29:28.750 --> 01:29:29.625
Isn't it?

01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:31.458
No kebab for me.

01:29:31.541 --> 01:29:35.083
What, you just gonna walk out of here
like there's no vibe between us, yeah?

01:29:35.791 --> 01:29:39.708
Seems like you have vibes with loads
of people, like the girl from Willesden.

01:29:40.125 --> 01:29:43.000
Okay, what you saw there was me
just being a certified wasteman.

01:29:43.083 --> 01:29:44.958
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm done with that.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.291
- I'm done with that tired old script.
- What do you want?

01:29:49.916 --> 01:29:50.750
I want you.

01:29:51.666 --> 01:29:53.583
I'm sorry, Raymond, but, um...

01:29:55.041 --> 01:29:58.583
you're the kind of guy that should come
with a warning sign on your forehead.

01:29:58.666 --> 01:30:00.958
And you'll cut me up again.
Yes, yes, you will.

01:30:01.041 --> 01:30:02.541
This is your fucking meat and drink.

01:30:02.625 --> 01:30:04.458
Picking up girls,
fucking with their heads.

01:30:04.541 --> 01:30:08.375
I'm sorry, but I look at you,
I feel like I'm 15.

01:30:08.458 --> 01:30:13.041
I got dazzles in my belly.
And this is where I get off.

01:30:14.208 --> 01:30:15.041
I can't.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:18.958
What are you doing?

01:30:19.625 --> 01:30:21.458
I'm Simone's heart, and I'm scared.

01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:28.333
Rah.

01:30:29.541 --> 01:30:32.041
Your heart just told me
that you keep her in a cage.

01:30:32.708 --> 01:30:33.708
That is very mean.

01:30:39.416 --> 01:30:41.208
Hello, Simone's heart. I'm Raymond.

01:30:41.625 --> 01:30:43.833
Um, I know why she keeps you caged,

01:30:43.916 --> 01:30:45.958
and it's because
she's trying to protect you.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.458
But I know a thing or two about cages,
and cages got keys.

01:31:01.333 --> 01:31:02.250
Hello.

01:31:04.958 --> 01:31:05.958

01:31:07.166 --> 01:31:08.000
