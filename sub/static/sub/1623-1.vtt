# These arms of mine

00:08.425 --> 00:10.916
# They are lonely...

00:11.053 --> 00:13.135
MAN: Where are you right now?

00:13.972 --> 00:17.180
Somewhere warm? Safe?

00:18.227 --> 00:20.058
Next to someone you love?

00:20.187 --> 00:25.853
Now, what if all that was gone and
the only thing you could do is survive?

00:27.402 --> 00:29.814
You would, right?

00:29.947 --> 00:32.279
You'd try.

00:32.407 --> 00:35.865
You'd do things, horrible things,

00:36.912 --> 00:40.120
until you lose that last thing
you have left:

00:40.249 --> 00:41.989
yourself.

00:43.752 --> 00:46.994
But what if you could take it back,

00:47.130 --> 00:50.964
all of it, a reset switch?

00:52.678 --> 00:54.760
You'd hit it, right?

00:56.056 --> 00:57.262
You'd have to.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.724
# They are burning...

01:02.271 --> 01:04.102
See you soon.

01:04.231 --> 01:07.598
# Burning from wanting you #

01:07.734 --> 01:09.725
WOMAN: It's never been about if.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.772
It's always been when.

01:11.905 --> 01:15.147
When we'll face the next epidemic,

01:15.284 --> 01:17.696
or the next pandemic.

01:17.828 --> 01:20.786
In Athens, 43OBC, typhoid.

01:20.914 --> 01:24.748
A thousand years later, the Justinian
Plague ravages the Byzantine Empire.

01:24.876 --> 01:28.585
In the 14th century,
the Black Death destroys most of Europe.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.796
Ancient history, right?

01:30.924 --> 01:34.087
Not exactly. This is last year.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.301
My home turf, Pennsylvania Memorial,

01:36.430 --> 01:38.546
during last season's whooping cough.

01:38.682 --> 01:41.298
We were overrun.
We didn't see it coming.

01:44.146 --> 01:49.231
This is a controversial thing to say in
front of a room full of doctors, but..

01:49.359 --> 01:50.860
we're not God.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.897
We can't predict the future,

01:53.030 --> 01:56.898
but we can plan for it, and that's what
I'm presenting here tonight,

01:57.034 --> 02:01.403
a level of preparation
unprecedented in modern medical history,

02:01.538 --> 02:06.248
and it needs to start right here, on
the front lines, with doctors like us.

02:08.712 --> 02:10.543
(PHONE RINGS)

02:10.672 --> 02:13.789
- Dr Railly.
- How'd the presentation go? Sign it.

02:13.925 --> 02:17.258
You know,
I might be getting the hang of this.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.844
- When are you coming home?
- Not soon enough.

02:19.973 --> 02:23.431
Senator Royce and l
have got another fundraiser tonight.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.926
I'm sorry there's been
so many of these in a row,

02:26.063 --> 02:27.849
but I got plans to make it up to you.

02:27.981 --> 02:32.065
They involve you, me, a cabin,

02:32.194 --> 02:36.233
no phones, no email,
a lot of wine, all weekend.

02:36.365 --> 02:37.980
l was hoping to see you tonight,

02:38.116 --> 02:41.483
but I guess I can let you sweep me
off my feet and make it up to me...

02:41.620 --> 02:42.735
a few times.

02:42.871 --> 02:45.487
Wow. Like a few times?

02:45.624 --> 02:48.115
Come home to me and I'll show you.

02:49.002 --> 02:52.119
- As soon as I can, sweetie.
- I'll be waiting up for you.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.710
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Aaron, call the police.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.174
- Hey, hey! Don't do that.
- Cassie?

02:58.303 --> 02:59.918
- Don't do that.
- Cassie?

03:00.055 --> 03:01.465
- Cassie?
- What happened?

03:01.598 --> 03:03.134
Cassie, stay on the line.

03:03.266 --> 03:06.099
Oh, my God.
Somebody just grabbed Cassie.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.389
Put the car in gear.
Drive us out of here.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.980
Hey, stop it! Listen to me.
l have a knife. I have a knife.

03:12.109 --> 03:15.693
I do not wanna use it, but I will
if I have to. You understand me?

03:15.821 --> 03:17.903
Put the car in drive.
Get us out of here.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.649
Drive the car. I don't have time
to play games with you. Drive.

03:31.753 --> 03:35.041
Do you want money? I can get you money.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.664
- We can go to an ATM.
- I don't want your money.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.792
I'm not here to steal from you.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.886
(LABORED BREATHING)

03:44.015 --> 03:46.347
I'm running out of time.

03:46.476 --> 03:49.843
It took too long to find you.
There's too many damn people.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.103
I'm not gonna hurt you, Dr Railly.

04:00.198 --> 04:04.612
- How do you know my name?
- Dr Cassandra Railly.

04:04.745 --> 04:08.704
Born October 3rd, 1980,
Syracuse, New York.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.995
Oldest child.
Intensive care, meningitis, 1986.

04:12.127 --> 04:15.711
Your mother died of an embolism in 1990.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.875
You went to medical school, Columbia.

04:18.008 --> 04:22.001

04:22.137 --> 04:24.173
-(COUGHS)
-2o15?

04:24.306 --> 04:28.515
- It's 2013. I work at a hospital.
- You're the right person, trust me.

04:28.643 --> 04:32.227
I don't have time to explain things.
Just tell me what I need to know.

04:32.355 --> 04:34.687
OK. OK.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.307
Where is Leland Frost?

04:40.447 --> 04:42.278
I don't know anyone by that name.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.651
What? What? No.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.947
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
Look, Leland Frost.

04:54.002 --> 04:54.991
- I'm sorry.
- Think!

04:55.128 --> 04:57.835
You know a man named Leland Frost.
I need to find him.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.704
- OK.
- Leland Frost!

04:59.841 --> 05:02.753
OK. Is he a patient?
So many people go through the hospital.

05:02.886 --> 05:06.549
- No. What are you talking about?
- I'm sorry.

05:06.681 --> 05:09.263
- Leland Frost!
- (SIREN WAILS)

05:10.519 --> 05:13.101
Pull in here. Pull the car over. Do it.

05:19.402 --> 05:22.394
- Get out! Get out of the car! Come on.
- No, please.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.067
Come on, come on.

05:24.199 --> 05:27.032
- Help!
- Hey, hey! Don't. Do not scream.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.994
Come on. Come here.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.038
- Stay. Stay there!
- OK.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.327
Stay there.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.167
Come on. Come on.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.708
Something's gotta go right.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.096
(COUGHS)

05:47.222 --> 05:51.181
What's your name?
You know mine already.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.134
- Cole.
- All right.

05:54.271 --> 05:57.434
- Cole, let's talk about this.
- Nothing to talk about.

05:58.733 --> 06:02.442
You don't know who Leland Frost is.
That means they sent me back too early.

06:02.571 --> 06:07.406
- What do you mean, too early?
- It's too far back in the past.

06:08.577 --> 06:11.364
- This is the present.
- No, this is the past.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.578
2043 is the present.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.323
- (COUGHS)
- You think you're from the future.

06:17.168 --> 06:20.706
OK, why did they send you
back in time, Cole?

06:21.756 --> 06:23.712
About four years from now,

06:23.842 --> 06:28.461
most of the human race is gonna be
wiped out by a plague, a virus,

06:28.597 --> 06:32.010
and we know that it's because of a man
named Leland Frost.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.098
I have to find him.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.434
- You saw my lecture.
- (COUGHS)

06:36.563 --> 06:38.269
OK, listen to me, Cole.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.435
I know you really believe these things,
but they're not real.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.399
I'm not crazy.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.444
I'm not crazy.

06:47.282 --> 06:50.024
- That's just like mine.
- It's notjust like yours.

06:50.160 --> 06:55.120
This is your watch from my time,
your future.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.284
This is your watch.

07:02.297 --> 07:06.415
Don't take your eyes off that watch, OK?

07:06.551 --> 07:08.633
OK.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.151
How is that happening?

07:34.287 --> 07:37.404
I know,
it's hard to wrap your mind around.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.576
You think it's impossible, but it's not.

07:39.709 --> 07:43.873
- I don't understand.
- Break the past, the future follows.

07:44.005 --> 07:47.088

- Cole.

Cole, listen to me.
You are not travelling through time.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.788
- You saw the watch.
- We have you surrounded!

You're gonna get killed.

- I can feel it.
- The alley is sealed off!

08:25.422 --> 08:29.540
I can feel it. It's happening.
It won't be long now.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.926
Show your hands!

- Weapon! Weapon!

- Don't shoot! Let me see it.

No. Get back. Get back.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.729
He's not my friend.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.857
He wasn't, anyway.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.860
I don't know what he was.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.071
You want another one?

10:18.118 --> 10:19.483
Sure.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.702
OK.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.257
Miss? Miss?

10:36.010 --> 10:37.295
I'm off my shift now,

10:37.428 --> 10:41.467
but, honey, I'm gonna give you
some unsolicited advice, OK?

10:41.599 --> 10:43.385
It's been a week.

But good luck.

Hi. Can you help me check out
of my room, please? I'm in 516.

Sure thing.

- Last name?

11:20.430 --> 11:23.922
You can't be in here.
Sir, would you please come with me?

Get off me!

Cole?

11:31.858 --> 11:32.893
Cole.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.150
Sorry. No, he's with me. He's with me.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.611
All right.
You need to get to a hospital.

11:38.740 --> 11:42.574
No, no, no.
No hospitals, no authorities. Just you.

11:45.747 --> 11:49.160
OK, almost there.
All right, stay with me.

I had to see if you were real.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.068
Here I am.

12:20.198 --> 12:22.280
Here you are.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.701
You know, you're late.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.240
It's not an exact science.

to spend the rest of your life

right here on the floor of this cell.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.765
- That's one option.
- What's the other one?

12:54.148 --> 12:57.891
Depends. Do you believe in fate?

13:00.196 --> 13:01.811
Sure.

13:01.948 --> 13:05.566
Fate, karma, Santa Claus.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.784
I'm very spiritual.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.871
(COUGHS)

13:14.043 --> 13:17.627
Spirituality is just science
we don't understand...

13:19.257 --> 13:20.417
...yet.

13:21.342 --> 13:26.006
Call it what you will, but something
led you and me to this moment.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.381
For what?

13:30.518 --> 13:36.309
A mission, one for which
I believe you were destined.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.649
Who are you?

13:40.611 --> 13:41.862
Jones is my name.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.905
You're going to help me
change the world, Mr Cole.

CASSIE: It's OK. You're OK.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.613
Hey, hey, hey, just lie back.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.492
Lie back. I'm here. I'm right here.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.332
Injections are complete.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.543
Your cells have taken to the process
quite nicely.

14:06.679 --> 14:11.594
Splintering will be painful.
Push through it as best you can.

14:11.726 --> 14:17.266
Time is different for you now.
Everyone else is bound by time. Not you.

14:17.398 --> 14:20.265
Not even a paradox can hold you back.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.310
Mr Cole.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.488
She is not your mission.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.992
She's just a puzzle piece.

14:38.294 --> 14:42.503
Remember, Mr Cole.
Remember your mission.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.957
Everything else is secondary.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.338
Everyone you see is already dead.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.022
- How long was I out?
- Almost three days.

15:02.151 --> 15:05.234
- What?
- Whoa. No. Whoa. Hold on.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.103

You're not exactly 100% yet.

Although you do heal fast,
like unusually fast.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.990
You're lucky.
The bullet passed clean through.

15:18.126 --> 15:22.290
You know, the one you took
before you disappeared.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.287
Splintered.

15:25.258 --> 15:29.422
- Is that what you call it?
- That's what they call it.

15:33.391 --> 15:35.473
You believe me now.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.555
You don't think I'm crazy?

15:40.148 --> 15:42.264
No crazier than I am.

15:42.942 --> 15:47.527
I mean, Ijust sewed up a bullet wound
I saw you get two years ago.

15:50.158 --> 15:53.321
I don't know what I believe, but...

15:55.788 --> 15:57.870
...you're here.

16:01.544 --> 16:04.206
OK. All right, we gotta move.

16:04.338 --> 16:07.956
Whoa. Hold on. Cole, you've just
been shot. Your body's been traumatized.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.629
- You need time to recover.
- I don't have time.

16:10.761 --> 16:13.013
- Ijust need a second.
- We don't have a second!

16:13.139 --> 16:14.675
Stop!

16:16.392 --> 16:20.010
You have no idea what the last two years
have been for me.

16:21.606 --> 16:25.349
It's been three days for you,
but it's been years for me.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.693
- Listen, Dr Railly...
- And it's not really doctor any more.

16:28.821 --> 16:32.985
It's kind of hard to keep your practice
when everyone thinks you're a lunatic.

16:37.121 --> 16:41.364
Now, you asked me to be here and I am...

16:43.753 --> 16:46.244
...but I have
a lot of goddamn questions.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.968
You're right.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.179
It's been a long time for you.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.516
You deserve some answers.

17:02.730 --> 17:06.473
Most of what we know
is pieced together from fragments,

17:06.609 --> 17:09.442
but it all started
with the world getting sick.

17:09.570 --> 17:16.032
In 2017,
a plague killed seven billion people.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.776
Only a fraction
of the world's population survived.

17:19.622 --> 17:23.535
Humanity's on the way out,
one more generation at best.

17:23.668 --> 17:27.911
The virus is mutating, evolving.

17:29.674 --> 17:33.383
Some of us, very few, were immune.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.006
Many became scavengers,

17:37.139 --> 17:39.881
or worse,
they took advantage of the chaos,

17:40.017 --> 17:43.680
raiding survivors, families,

17:43.813 --> 17:49.558
for food, supplies,
whatever they could get their hands on.

17:49.694 --> 17:54.563
The rest went underground,
starving, near extinction.

17:54.699 --> 17:58.988
Till one day a group of scientists
returned to the surface

17:59.120 --> 18:02.738
to gather information,
piece together whatever they could.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.707
And they found something,

18:06.836 --> 18:09.828
a possible reset switch,

18:09.964 --> 18:13.627
something started in your time,
finished in mine,

18:13.759 --> 18:15.499
a last resort.

18:15.636 --> 18:19.970
Our only option is to undo it,

18:20.099 --> 18:23.262
stop the plague
from ever happening in the first place.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.866
Why did you come for me?

18:46.375 --> 18:50.288
COLE: When the world was falling apart,
you were with the CDC.

18:52.757 --> 18:55.294
Holed up, searching for a cure.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.386
You died there.

19:01.182 --> 19:06.597
But you were able to send a message
to anyone who'd listen, just a voice.

19:06.729 --> 19:09.892
Now, the message that we have
is... is broken.

19:10.024 --> 19:11.480
The data's been corrupted.

19:11.609 --> 19:14.442
My name is Dr Cassandra Railly
of the... (STATIC)

19:14.570 --> 19:17.027
We 're working on containment
of the... (STATIC)

19:17.156 --> 19:19.488
CDC stations... hear me.

19:19.617 --> 19:23.485
The plague starts with Leland Frost.

19:24.997 --> 19:29.081
The true architects of the plague,
they're watching me.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.701
I 'm running out of time.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.249
...is among you. Please, Cole.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.048
I said your name?

19:38.969 --> 19:40.709
You gave me this mission.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.428
You're the reason I'm here.

19:43.557 --> 19:46.014
Now, it's been two years, Cassie.

19:47.228 --> 19:51.813
Please tell me
you know who Leland Frost is.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.985
Idon1.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.911
RAILLY:
Ever since the day you disappeared

20:08.040 --> 20:11.578
or splintered or whatever,
I've been looking for Leland Frost.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.952
- What'd you find?
- A whole bunch of them.

20:14.088 --> 20:19.048
But no one fitting the description of
a guy who ends the world with a plague.

20:19.176 --> 20:22.418
So I had to enlist some help.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.222
MAN: I'll be right down.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.801
Can I...?

20:30.938 --> 20:32.394
Yeah.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.693
I'm very hungry.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.691
- Who is this guy?
- Jeremy was NSA.

20:46.203 --> 20:49.536
His job was to know things
people didn't want him to know.

20:49.665 --> 20:52.156
My father did
some consulting work for him.

20:52.293 --> 20:55.035
I told your father
if he needed anything, I'd be there.

20:55.171 --> 20:58.459
Of course, those offers
aren't meant to be handed down.

20:58.591 --> 21:02.175
Jeremy's been helping me dig through
Leland Frosts. We needed to filter.

21:02.303 --> 21:03.668
From what Cassie's told me,

21:03.804 --> 21:06.841
we're looking for somebody
connected with bioengineering.

21:06.974 --> 21:12.435
And now I know why we haven't found him.
The name's not Leland Frost.

21:13.856 --> 21:17.940
It's Leland Goines,
CEO of the Markridge Group.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.104
Aren't they working
on a malaria vaccine?

21:20.237 --> 21:23.400
That's the surface story, but if
you follow the black-budget coins,

21:23.532 --> 21:26.695
it's gonna flow right into biological
and chemical munitions.

21:26.827 --> 21:30.740
Military programs way, way off book.

21:30.873 --> 21:34.240
This guy, Leland, take a look
at his internal security designation.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.367
Frost.

21:36.504 --> 21:38.165
That's him.

21:39.381 --> 21:42.293
We've been tracking the wrong name.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.883
Leland Goines, where is he?

21:45.012 --> 21:47.674
I can tell you where he's gonna be
tomorrow night.

21:47.807 --> 21:51.391
There's a big soirée in DC.
Markridge will be there.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.009
Then that's where we're going.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.386
It'll be a buttoned-up
security operation.

21:55.523 --> 22:00.187
Have to be on the list to get in,
like Senator Royce.

22:02.655 --> 22:06.898
- Royce is gonna be there?
- Probably more trouble than it's worth.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.742
Could work, though.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.162
Oh, that's good.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.627
If I lived in this time,
this is all I'd eat.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.042
Cheeseburgers every meal.

22:25.219 --> 22:29.929
Hey, we need to come up with a game plan
for when we find Leland Goines.

22:30.057 --> 22:32.389
We find him, I kill him, that's it.

22:34.520 --> 22:40.231
No. No, you can'tjust walk in there
and murder someone.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.725
One for seven billion?
That math works for me.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.568
That might not solve the problem.

22:44.697 --> 22:48.315
Whatever this guy's done to create
this plague might already be underway.

22:48.450 --> 22:52.068
No, let's say you stop him, how will you
know if the future has changed?

22:52.204 --> 22:54.616
We'll know. I'll be erased.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.415
You mean you'll... you're gonna die?

22:58.544 --> 23:02.503
No, it's... it's not death.
It's something else.

23:02.631 --> 23:07.091
This me will never have been
from that moment forward.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.595
It's complicated.

23:11.473 --> 23:14.601
It's OK. I knew
this was a one-way trip coming in.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.848
And then what about the future?

23:22.902 --> 23:25.939
It'll be rewritten
into something better.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.445
Plague will never have happened.

23:29.575 --> 23:31.657
My time will be gone.

23:32.620 --> 23:36.238
Trust me,
there's nothing there worth saving.

23:59.897 --> 24:02.183
OK we'll work our wa in slow.
5

24:04.234 --> 24:07.101
Price tag. Can't have that.

24:07.237 --> 24:10.821
Keep an eye out for Goines. Try to
look like you're not keeping an eye out.

24:10.950 --> 24:14.568
- Right.
- If he's in there, we'll find him.

24:18.499 --> 24:21.536
- You look good.
- Thanks.

24:22.586 --> 24:27.205
You... You look like the women
we used to see in old magazines.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.166
Which magazines?

24:33.305 --> 24:38.550
I mean... you look... clean.

24:41.188 --> 24:43.850
I'll take it. Thank you.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.559
That's good.
Smiles are good. We're at a party.

24:49.029 --> 24:52.738
- Good evening. Your name, please?
- Dr Cassandra Railly.

24:52.866 --> 24:54.948
- OK.
- With my plus one.

24:57.913 --> 25:00.199
- First name again, please?
- Cassandra.

25:01.750 --> 25:04.833
- It may or may not be under "doctor".
- I'll find it.

25:04.962 --> 25:07.954
Thank you. It's a very long list.

25:11.218 --> 25:18.056
It's Railly. R-A-I-L-L-Y.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.265
Uh, Senator, excuse me one second.

25:20.394 --> 25:22.305
Cassie.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.349
What are you doing here?

25:25.482 --> 25:29.851
Wow. I'm consulting for the Markridge
Group, their inoculation project.

25:29.987 --> 25:31.978
I had no idea you would be here.

25:32.114 --> 25:35.402
I guess I should have figured that out,
movers and shakers an' all.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.820
- Ma'am, I'm not finding it.
- Oh.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.864
No, it's fine. She's... She's with me.

25:39.997 --> 25:41.407
- Oh.
- I'll take your coat.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.041
Thank you.

25:43.625 --> 25:48.289
Oh, Aaron, this is Greg.
He's my plus one.

25:48.422 --> 25:51.164
- Greg, hi there.
- Hello.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.382
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

25:54.178 --> 25:56.885
So how do you know each other?

25:59.933 --> 26:04.472
- She bought me a cheeseburger.
- She...

26:04.605 --> 26:08.473
MAN: Marker, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

26:08.609 --> 26:12.147
If you'll excuse me,
I've got an ass I've gotta go kiss,

26:12.279 --> 26:15.112
but this is to be continued, all right?

26:15.240 --> 26:17.322
Of course.

26:24.750 --> 26:28.288
OK. Let's go find Goines.

26:38.388 --> 26:39.423
No.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.446
Cole.

27:28.522 --> 27:32.310
Sorry about that. I know it's why
you used to hate these things.

27:33.527 --> 27:34.983
You look good.

27:35.112 --> 27:38.821
God, what the hell am I saying?
You look great.

27:42.744 --> 27:45.451
Honestly, Cass, it's great to see you
back on your feet.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.117
Thank you.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.750
(INDISTINCT VOICE OVER RADIO)

28:08.520 --> 28:11.182
Hey, you got another one of those?

28:17.905 --> 28:20.021
I was worried about you, Cass.

28:21.366 --> 28:24.608
- Well, you don't have to be any more.
- That's good.

28:26.496 --> 28:30.034
- Damn it, you didn't have to leave.
- Yes, I did.

28:30.167 --> 28:32.032
A man vanished before your eyes.

28:32.169 --> 28:35.161
If a patient said that to you,
what diagnosis would you give?

28:35.297 --> 28:37.253
I wasn't your patient, Aaron.

28:37.382 --> 28:41.295
- What did you want me to do?
- I wanted you to believe me.

28:41.428 --> 28:44.420
I believe that something happened to you
that night, Cassie,

28:44.556 --> 28:46.092
and I am sorry about that, I am,

28:46.225 --> 28:48.591
but I do not believe
that it was a time traveler.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.184
OK. You know what?
I can't do this right now.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.304
It was really good seeing you, Aaron.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.522
- Excuse me.
- OK. Cassie...

29:05.827 --> 29:08.318
GOINES: Truth is,
in the rest of the 21st century,

29:08.455 --> 29:11.162
scientists will be your rock stars.

29:11.291 --> 29:15.125
Like this guy. This is Jagger.

29:16.296 --> 29:19.163
He may not look like him,
might not sound like him,

29:19.299 --> 29:21.085
not nearly as cool as him,

29:21.218 --> 29:26.133
but what's in this
is gonna change the world.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.472
Me, I'm just a numbers guy,

29:28.600 --> 29:33.970
but Oliver here,
he's a damn Rolling Stone.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.476
What is it that you do, Oliver?

29:37.609 --> 29:40.817
I study viral and bacterial modalities
and their interpolation

29:40.946 --> 29:43.028
relating to biochemical application.

29:43.156 --> 29:47.274
He plays God, and quite convincingly.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.036
No.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.589
Cole.

30:02.718 --> 30:04.800
No! Cole!

30:06.888 --> 30:08.173
Cole!

30:13.437 --> 30:15.644
No!

30:22.571 --> 30:25.062
Get him out of here.

30:27.075 --> 30:29.737
Get on this.

30:38.420 --> 30:39.956
Cassie, tell me what this is.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.500
- I'm not gonna explain this to you.
- You better.

30:42.632 --> 30:45.590
You used me to get into this place
and now my ass is on the line.

30:45.719 --> 30:47.255
I'm sorry.

30:47.387 --> 30:52.302
Did this guy, did this Cole, did he
find you or did you find him, huh?

30:52.434 --> 30:55.551
Is this just some kind of twisted
Stockholm syndrome?

30:55.687 --> 30:57.723
Oh, that's what it is.

31:00.650 --> 31:01.901
Damn it.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.115
I had him. Why'd you stop me?

31:11.244 --> 31:14.111
I told you, you can'tjust kill someone.

31:14.247 --> 31:16.408
He's already dead.

31:16.541 --> 31:20.409
Don't you understand that?
Everybody is already dead.

31:20.545 --> 31:23.912
You are already dead because of him!

31:26.301 --> 31:33.013
Seven billion people dead.
I had a chance to stop him.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.351
Something is wrong.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.358
Hey.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.448
Who is that? Cole.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.487
- No, no, no!
- Hey! Hey!

31:53.620 --> 31:56.532
- Cole!
Get off me! Cassie!

32:02.462 --> 32:06.330
Her name is Cassandra Railly, was a
respected neurologist from Philadelphia,

32:06.466 --> 32:08.047
left her practice last January.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.428
- What about him?
- Just this.

32:10.554 --> 32:14.172
An unsolved from two years ago.
Someone apparently kidnapped Dr Railly.

32:14.307 --> 32:17.140
This guy's prints
match those found at the scene. No ID.

32:17.269 --> 32:20.887
Railly said his name was Cole
and that he vanished before her eyes.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.478
Vanished?

32:22.607 --> 32:25.474
She said he claimed to be
from the future. Loony tunes.

32:25.610 --> 32:29.444
Hey. Hey! No! Cassie!

32:30.907 --> 32:35.196
Get him sedated and call Ollie.
I want him to run the works.

32:36.413 --> 32:38.404
- On this guy?
- Get it done.

32:39.749 --> 32:43.333
OLIVER: Scientifically speaking,
this guy is an impossibility. Look.

32:43.462 --> 32:47.626
This is the neural activity of a normal
brain working complex mathematics.

32:47.757 --> 32:50.965
This, that's our friend in there.

32:51.094 --> 32:56.214
That is grand mal seizure activity
without the chaos or the damage.

32:56.349 --> 33:00.012
- Take a look at his adrenal glands.
- They're on overdrive.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.932
Explains how he took down
all that security.

33:04.065 --> 33:06.932
Right, but nothing explains
his physiology.

33:07.068 --> 33:09.775
Look, Markridge is the cutting edge
of biotechnology,

33:09.905 --> 33:14.114
but this guy... this guy's
a flesh-and-blood molecular computer.

33:14.242 --> 33:17.450
Programmed for what? No clue.
We'll have to ask him.

33:17.579 --> 33:19.535
But I can tell you that this Cole person

33:19.664 --> 33:22.906
is a product of advancements
way past us,

33:23.043 --> 33:25.250
by 20 years, maybe more.

33:38.183 --> 33:39.719
- Are you all right?
- I'm OK.

33:39.851 --> 33:40.840
- Look at me.
- I'm OK.

33:40.977 --> 33:42.717
- Did they hurt you?
- Listen to me.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.311
I think I'm running out of time.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.055
You're gonna splinter?

33:47.192 --> 33:48.978
Good. Listen to me.

33:49.110 --> 33:52.853
Just go back five hours, get us out of
the whole thing, the party, the police.

33:52.989 --> 33:55.105
I can't do that.
It doesn't work like that.

33:55.242 --> 33:58.575
It doesn't work like that.
It's too precise. It's too dangerous.

33:58.703 --> 34:01.866
I could run into
another instance of myself and it...

34:03.750 --> 34:05.991
Give me your watch. Give me your watch.

34:07.837 --> 34:11.295
If you're hoping
to reprise your efforts from the party,

34:11.424 --> 34:15.258
you should know that these gentlemen
have orders to kill her first.

34:20.141 --> 34:26.558
Now, in all currently known science,
time travel is impossible.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.981
Here's the thing, Cole.

34:31.528 --> 34:34.895
I have something
currently known science doesn't.

34:35.031 --> 34:39.274
You ready for this?
This is crazy stuff, but it's true.

34:42.080 --> 34:45.664
I remember meeting you in 1987,

34:46.918 --> 34:48.749
28 years ago,

34:48.878 --> 34:52.837
and you looked exactly the same
as you do today.

34:59.556 --> 35:02.013
Don't understand? That's OK.

35:03.893 --> 35:06.430
I didn't either at first.

35:06.563 --> 35:12.274
Told myself here's a man who looks like
someone I met a long time ago.

35:13.903 --> 35:18.772
And then I realized... he is that man.

35:18.908 --> 35:21.866
I didn't meet you in 1987.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.699
Not yet.

35:25.832 --> 35:27.288
But you will.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.996
What was it you were looking for?

35:34.090 --> 35:37.173
Was it Horsemen of the Apocalypse
or something?

35:37.302 --> 35:39.384
No.

35:40.347 --> 35:44.386
Army of the 12 Monkeys.

35:44.517 --> 35:46.929
They end the world, right?

35:47.062 --> 35:49.053
Yeah, that was it.

35:49.189 --> 35:52.056
And it's hard to forget.

35:58.365 --> 36:00.105
You don't know who they are yet.

36:06.289 --> 36:08.496
You know what this means, right?

36:10.001 --> 36:14.791
You are evidence
that at some point, somewhere,

36:14.923 --> 36:16.709
the impossible is made possible,

36:16.841 --> 36:18.923
and for some reason...

36:21.221 --> 36:23.837
...it has to do with me.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.183
So what do I do?

36:36.319 --> 36:38.310
I mean, clearly, after today's events,

36:38.446 --> 36:42.189
you view me
as some kind of adversary or an enemy.

36:47.205 --> 36:50.948
Tell me, what do I do
that is so monumental

36:51.084 --> 36:58.172
that the laws of physics are broken
to send you chasing after me?

37:03.263 --> 37:05.424
No? All right.

37:08.977 --> 37:12.219
Whatever it is,
it appears it was all for nothing.

37:14.065 --> 37:17.808
And this isn't personal, Cole,
I just gotta cut you up...

37:19.487 --> 37:21.694
see what makes you tick.

37:21.823 --> 37:26.112
I guess that means you aren't gonna
be able to go back to 1987 after all.

37:28.830 --> 37:30.912
You know what they call that?

37:32.333 --> 37:33.584
Paradox.

37:38.882 --> 37:40.838
Her I don't need.

37:41.968 --> 37:44.300
- Keep it clean.
- Goines.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.511
You wanna see what a paradox looks like?

37:52.979 --> 37:54.970
OK.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.188
(TICKING)

38:17.962 --> 38:19.042
Look closely.

39:59.606 --> 40:01.722
You OK?

40:04.235 --> 40:05.475
Whatjust happened?

40:06.905 --> 40:10.614
Something comes back in time,
comes into contact with itself,

40:10.742 --> 40:14.200
Mother Nature doesn't like it
when you rearrange her furniture.

41:09.217 --> 41:11.299
You can't kill me, Cole...

41:13.346 --> 41:15.382
...cos that would mean you'd...

41:15.515 --> 41:18.632
you'd have no reason
to come for me in the first place.

41:43.918 --> 41:45.203
He's dead.

41:49.716 --> 41:51.581
But you're still here.

41:59.767 --> 42:01.883
No.

42:03.855 --> 42:04.935
No, no, no.

42:06.482 --> 42:08.564
That doesn't make any sense.

42:12.488 --> 42:14.570
That doesn't make any sense. He...

42:17.160 --> 42:19.242
How is that possible?!

42:30.173 --> 42:32.255
How is that possible?

42:47.982 --> 42:51.816
Don't lose this. It's gonna
save our ass again a minute ago.

42:53.196 --> 42:55.278
- Right.
- (INDISTINCT VOICES)

42:56.824 --> 42:58.940
Come on. Come on, we gotta go.

43:02.538 --> 43:05.029
Over here. Right here, OK?

43:10.046 --> 43:11.911
(SIREN WAILS)

43:12.048 --> 43:14.164
Come on.

43:14.300 --> 43:17.133
Come on. Over here.

43:17.261 --> 43:19.343
Come on. OK, all right, listen to me.

43:19.472 --> 43:22.680
You gotta get as far away from here
as possible and stay hidden.

43:22.809 --> 43:26.017
- They're gonna be looking for you.
- What about you?

43:26.145 --> 43:28.978
I'm going back... now.

43:30.024 --> 43:32.936
To tell them about Goines
and the Army of the 12 Monkeys.

43:33.069 --> 43:34.605
They end the world.

43:37.865 --> 43:39.730
Will I see you again?

43:43.121 --> 43:45.578
I don't know.

43:45.706 --> 43:47.537
You have to go... now.

43:47.667 --> 43:49.749
Go. Go.

43:55.967 --> 43:58.049
(YELLS)

44:12.775 --> 44:15.812
- How you feeling, brother?
- Top of the world, Ramse.

44:17.822 --> 44:19.904
Mr Cole, did you find him?

44:20.032 --> 44:22.114
Yeah, Ifound him.

44:23.995 --> 44:26.077
Then you failed your mission.

44:29.333 --> 44:32.791
You were to eliminate him
before he could release the plague.

44:33.421 --> 44:35.503
Leland's dead.

44:36.632 --> 44:40.124
I killed him,
just like you wanted me to.

44:41.637 --> 44:43.628
You were wrong.

44:43.764 --> 44:45.891
Killing him didn't change anything.

44:47.643 --> 44:49.725
There were others.

44:51.314 --> 44:53.396
There were always others.

44:55.359 --> 44:57.771
Others?

44:57.904 --> 45:00.020
Others who?

45:15.546 --> 45:17.628
Mr Cole, who?

45:37.568 --> 45:39.900
The Army of the 12 Monkeys.

45:52.500 --> 45:54.582
MAN: I'm here to see Goines.

45:55.878 --> 45:58.494
There's been an accident.

46:03.094 --> 46:05.710
Your father is dead. I'm sorry.

46:06.722 --> 46:08.804
There'll be some papers to Sign.

46:11.102 --> 46:14.594
Your father left you
a great deal of money.

46:15.523 --> 46:16.854
I know if he were here,

46:16.983 --> 46:20.225
he would tell you he always wanted you
to carry on his work.

46:20.361 --> 46:25.401
He may not have shown it,
but he considered you his legacy.

46:28.244 --> 46:30.326
