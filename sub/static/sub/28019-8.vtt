WEBVTT

00:04.630 --> 00:06.125
John? Yeah.

00:06.149 --> 00:08.697
Get out here. I think I can see Mars.

00:08.721 --> 00:11.463
I'll be right out, babe,
I'm just gonna take my insulin.

00:12.725 --> 00:15.032
You better not fall asleep in there.

00:17.078 --> 00:18.881
I don't know.

00:18.905 --> 00:21.884
It might be an alien spaceship.

00:21.908 --> 00:23.882
Or a bug in the lens.

00:25.425 --> 00:27.827
But I seriously think it's Mars.

00:28.512 --> 00:30.482
You coming to have a look?

00:38.795 --> 00:39.815
Babe?

00:41.150 --> 00:43.321
I knew you'd fall asleep.

00:44.194 --> 00:46.170
I knew it.

00:48.065 --> 00:49.632
Oh, you're freezing.

00:50.075 --> 00:51.764
Why are you so cold?

00:53.853 --> 00:55.205
John?

00:55.855 --> 00:58.008
Oh, my God.

00:58.032 --> 00:59.511
John?

01:00.335 --> 01:01.644
Wake up!

01:03.907 --> 01:08.714
I'm picturing bachelor pad chic.

01:08.738 --> 01:09.715
Uh-huh.

01:09.739 --> 01:11.978
With a private dojo, obviously.

01:12.002 --> 01:13.632
Obviously.

01:15.832 --> 01:20.378
And, and an entire room
for just your suits.

01:23.448 --> 01:25.774
I have to see your place.

01:25.798 --> 01:28.975
You will. Next time.

01:31.021 --> 01:32.955
You said that last time.

01:32.979 --> 01:34.981
- Did I?
- Mm-hmm.

01:42.641 --> 01:44.532
Oh, I-I got it.

01:44.556 --> 01:45.968
Oh, yeah, it is you.

01:45.992 --> 01:48.014
It's the boss.

01:48.038 --> 01:49.668
Kate Barrett.

01:49.692 --> 01:51.452
Apologies for the late hour.

01:51.476 --> 01:53.237
Not a problem, sir. What's going on?

01:53.261 --> 01:54.760
What was the name
of that private negotiator

01:54.784 --> 01:56.675
you worked with
on the Black Dolphin case?

01:56.699 --> 01:58.155
Eric Beaumont.

01:58.179 --> 01:59.811
Yeah. What'd you think of him?

02:00.729 --> 02:02.985
I'd say he does good work. Why?

02:03.009 --> 02:04.422
See if you can get in touch with him.

02:04.446 --> 02:06.424
I need an out-of-house negotiator ASAP.

02:06.448 --> 02:08.121
We got a lead in the Hemmigen case.

02:08.145 --> 02:10.122
I'll see if I can track him down.

02:10.146 --> 02:11.540
Great.

02:13.194 --> 02:16.675
My boss needs you to consult on
a major domestic terrorism case.

02:17.537 --> 02:18.566
Okay.

02:18.590 --> 02:19.983
We have to get to New Jersey right away.

02:21.027 --> 02:23.418
- I'll call my team.
- Great.

02:25.209 --> 02:27.315
Does he know about us?

02:27.339 --> 02:29.123
That's a negative. Does your team?

02:29.800 --> 02:31.777
I don't think it's come up.

02:32.461 --> 02:33.679
Hmm.

02:39.045 --> 02:41.613
- Maxine, I love you.
- Do it, now!

02:43.000 --> 02:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.405 --> 02:52.600
Eric.

02:52.624 --> 02:55.192
Oliver. The FBI needs our help on a case.

02:55.701 --> 02:56.604
Okay.

02:56.628 --> 02:57.692
You okay?

02:57.716 --> 02:59.259
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

02:59.283 --> 03:02.132
Just got woken up in the middle
of the night is all.

03:02.156 --> 03:03.133
Where we going?

03:03.157 --> 03:04.134
New Jersey.

03:04.158 --> 03:05.439
Can you call Zara and Cynthia?

03:05.463 --> 03:07.137
I need you guys on the next flight out.

03:07.161 --> 03:09.051
I'll explain the details
when you get there.

03:09.075 --> 03:10.424
Okay.

03:45.503 --> 03:48.047
Cri/Res' A-team. Good to have you here.

03:48.071 --> 03:50.223
Hey, Kate. Nice to meet you in person.

03:50.247 --> 03:51.398
You, too, Zara.

03:51.422 --> 03:53.270
- It's good to see you again, Kate.
- Cynthia.

03:53.294 --> 03:55.054
So this is Hemmigen Pharmaceuticals.

03:55.078 --> 03:58.231
The largest supplier of diabetic
insulin in the country.

03:58.255 --> 04:00.803
Three days ago, somebody
poisoned the supply.

04:00.827 --> 04:02.496
It's all over the news. Cyanide, right?

04:02.520 --> 04:04.585
Right. Hemmigen is
testing all their batches.

04:04.609 --> 04:06.239
They've issued a complete recall.

04:06.263 --> 04:08.110
But now there's a massive
insulin shortage

04:08.134 --> 04:09.240
across the country.

04:09.264 --> 04:11.723
Why can't other suppliers
step up to meet the demand?

04:11.747 --> 04:14.546
They have, but there are
23 million diabetics nationwide,

04:14.570 --> 04:17.149
and Hemmigen supplies
insulin to 93% of them.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.120
So far, there have been
eight deaths by poisoning

04:19.144 --> 04:22.954
and about 700,000 people
have no access to insulin.

04:23.454 --> 04:25.476
Yesterday, an unknown
subject called Hemmigen,

04:25.500 --> 04:28.130
wanting $50 million to
stop the insulin murders.

04:28.154 --> 04:30.916
He revealed a batch number that
Hemmigen hadn't tested yet.

04:31.338 --> 04:34.311
Turns out, it waspoisoned,
and he claims to know the rest.

04:34.335 --> 04:36.095
Boss, this is the team

04:36.119 --> 04:37.662
from Crisis Resolution.

04:37.686 --> 04:39.403
Guys, Assistant Director Donovan.

04:39.427 --> 04:41.405
Nice to meet you all.
I've heard great things.

04:41.429 --> 04:43.276
Eric Beaumont.
It's good to meet you, sir.

04:43.300 --> 04:46.279
Look, normally we keep
negotiation in-house,

04:46.303 --> 04:48.107
but this unknown subject
is a conspiracy theorist

04:48.131 --> 04:49.630
who doesn't want to deal with the Feds.

04:49.654 --> 04:51.241
We're happy to help in any way we can.

04:51.265 --> 04:52.677
Good, 'cause we're running out of time.

04:52.701 --> 04:55.201
We're getting reports that
ERs across the country

04:55.225 --> 04:58.335
are overflowing with patients
falling into diabetic comas

04:58.359 --> 05:00.237
- from not taking their insulin.
- You're saying

05:00.261 --> 05:03.122
the fear of being poisoned
can actually kill people?

05:03.146 --> 05:06.038
Correct. Now, the FDA
is advising diabetics

05:06.062 --> 05:08.083
to get clean insulin
from other suppliers,

05:08.107 --> 05:09.751
but there's not enough for everyone.

05:10.371 --> 05:13.088
The red dots indicate
where poisoned batches

05:13.112 --> 05:16.258
were found, the faces
represent fatalities.

05:16.681 --> 05:18.877
Our victim report rate is accelerating.

05:18.901 --> 05:21.358
How long can diabetics go
without taking their meds?

05:21.382 --> 05:23.708
After 36 hours, there's
vomiting, dehydration,

05:23.732 --> 05:25.492
then they fall into a diabetic coma.

05:25.516 --> 05:27.852
If the coma goes untreated, they can die.

05:27.853 --> 05:30.614
How long till Hemmigen finishes
testing all their batches?

05:30.638 --> 05:32.051
They need three more days.

05:32.075 --> 05:34.270
- We don't have three more days.
- Which is why

05:34.294 --> 05:36.055
we need you to negotiate
the caller into giving up

05:36.079 --> 05:37.708
the rest of the poisoned batch numbers

05:37.732 --> 05:39.473
in the next 24 hours.

05:54.010 --> 06:02.037
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

06:05.316 --> 06:06.989
Attention, Hemmigen employees,

06:07.013 --> 06:10.061
please be aware of increased
security on the premises.

06:10.974 --> 06:14.083
Another death.
That brings the total to ten.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.085
Did you find any pattern to
which batches were poisoned?

06:16.109 --> 06:18.348
No, the batch numbers
are all over the place.

06:18.372 --> 06:20.530
They're seemingly random.

06:20.984 --> 06:23.158
I'm gonna make sure
we're set up for the call.

06:25.771 --> 06:27.749
So, you and Kate, huh?

06:28.106 --> 06:29.673
How long has this been going on?

06:30.733 --> 06:32.188
Are you reading my metrics?

06:32.212 --> 06:34.016
All right, Beaumont.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.409
Good for you, man.

06:35.433 --> 06:37.672
- You guys serious?
- No.

06:37.696 --> 06:39.413
No, not serious at all.

06:40.190 --> 06:41.408
Oliver?

06:43.136 --> 06:44.493
Wendy?

06:44.517 --> 06:46.333
What are... what are you doing here?

06:46.357 --> 06:48.161
I work here.

06:48.185 --> 06:50.946
You're looking at Hemmigen's
VP of risk management.

06:50.970 --> 06:52.382
Eric Beaumont.

06:52.406 --> 06:55.023
Wendy Vaughan. Nice to meet you.

06:55.409 --> 06:56.560
Uh, Wendy and I went

06:56.584 --> 06:58.171
to grad school together.

06:58.195 --> 07:00.608
We were sparring partners
in the psychology department.

07:00.632 --> 07:03.132
Pizza and beer and Lacanian
psychoanalytic theory.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.005
Never met a guy who used
philosophical reinterpretations

07:06.029 --> 07:08.921
of Freudian teachings as foreplay before.

07:08.945 --> 07:10.139
We dated for a bit.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.374
Didn't last. Better off as friends.

07:13.917 --> 07:17.128
So, I understand you're handling
the negotiation, Mr. Beaumont.

07:17.152 --> 07:18.140
As Hemmigen's rep,

07:18.165 --> 07:19.975
- I'd like to be on the call.
- Of course.

07:19.999 --> 07:21.411
Hemmigen is going to do everything it can

07:21.435 --> 07:23.457
to make sure no more innocent people die.

07:23.481 --> 07:25.420
Eric, Oliver, this is Dinesh.

07:25.444 --> 07:26.765
He'll be handling communications.

07:26.789 --> 07:29.028
Hey, the UnSub should be making
contact any minute, yeah.

07:29.432 --> 07:30.793
Okay.

07:32.969 --> 07:35.425
So, Wendy Vaughan, now, huh?

07:35.449 --> 07:37.384
I thought you swore to never get hitched.

07:37.408 --> 07:39.386
I distinctly remember you
saying something about

07:39.410 --> 07:41.214
the institution of marriage

07:41.238 --> 07:43.607
being "a patriarchal stranglehold."

07:43.631 --> 07:45.871
And then I met Peter Vaughan.

07:46.575 --> 07:48.482
Wait, Senator Pete Vaughan?

07:48.506 --> 07:50.299
I'm a politician's wife now.

07:50.323 --> 07:52.791
I know. How very unfeminist of me.

07:52.815 --> 07:56.126
What about you? You got a
lucky lady in your life?

07:57.123 --> 07:59.710
Oh, I'm sorry. I hit a sore spot.

07:59.734 --> 08:01.321
Can I ask what her name is?

08:01.345 --> 08:03.323
Yeah, her name is, uh, Maxine.

08:03.347 --> 08:05.107
We used to work together.

08:05.131 --> 08:07.327
Hmm. You know what they say
about mixing business

08:07.351 --> 08:09.720
with pleasure.

08:10.432 --> 08:11.746
All right, it's him.

08:19.189 --> 08:20.514
My name's Eric Beaumont,
I'm a negotiator.

08:20.538 --> 08:21.950
Who am I speaking with?

08:21.974 --> 08:23.612
I said no Feds.

08:24.063 --> 08:26.041
I assure you, I'm not a Fed.

08:26.065 --> 08:27.347
I used to work at the FBI,

08:27.371 --> 08:29.286
but not anymore. I'm independent.

08:30.390 --> 08:31.438
Waveform match?

08:31.463 --> 08:32.525
Why did you leave?

08:32.549 --> 08:33.614
No, nothing from our database.

08:34.265 --> 08:36.530
Why'd I leave the FBI?

08:36.750 --> 08:38.183
Guns, mainly.

08:38.626 --> 08:40.011
I don't like violence.

08:40.035 --> 08:42.884
Oh, I wouldn't go anywhere
without my .45.

08:42.908 --> 08:44.712
Only way to protect yourself.

08:44.736 --> 08:46.757
Otherwise, you're in their hands.

08:46.781 --> 08:49.021
Tapping our phones, invading our privacy.

08:49.045 --> 08:51.197
We can't see 'em, but they're there.

08:51.890 --> 08:54.678
How do I know you are
who you say you are?

08:54.702 --> 08:56.245
Because I know all the batch numbers

08:56.269 --> 08:57.464
of all the poisoned insulin.

08:57.488 --> 09:00.119
Well, I'd like to know them, too.

09:00.143 --> 09:01.598
You will after I get my money.

09:01.622 --> 09:04.471
- $50 million, cash.
- Cash?

09:04.495 --> 09:06.299
At a drop location of my choosing.

09:06.655 --> 09:07.909
That's a lot of money.

09:07.933 --> 09:09.432
Drop in the bucket for Hemmigen.

09:09.456 --> 09:11.347
They'll pay to protect their image.

09:11.371 --> 09:12.740
They don't care about the victims

09:12.764 --> 09:14.698
unless they affect their bottom line.

09:15.038 --> 09:16.309
We can look into putting
that money together,

09:16.333 --> 09:18.441
but first we need a sign
of your goodwill.

09:18.465 --> 09:21.357
HP-50622.

09:21.381 --> 09:22.793
You test that batch yet?

09:22.817 --> 09:26.188
Hemmigen tested it this
morning, and it is poisoned,

09:26.212 --> 09:28.218
but the news isn't public yet.

09:30.042 --> 09:31.933
No. No, we haven't.

09:31.957 --> 09:33.775
You're gonna want to test it.

09:33.799 --> 09:35.642
$50 million in cash.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.418
You got a deal.

09:38.442 --> 09:39.922
What the hell, Beaumont?

09:41.053 --> 09:42.335
This is how he works.

09:42.359 --> 09:43.727
- By not negotiating?
- Trust him.

09:43.751 --> 09:44.815
He's got a plan.

09:44.839 --> 09:46.711
I want confirmation from Hemmigen.

09:51.991 --> 09:55.000
This is Wendy Vaughan, Vice
President of Risk Management.

09:55.537 --> 09:57.497
You have my word
that you'll get your money.

09:58.375 --> 10:00.005
But you don't know who
you're dealing with.

10:00.029 --> 10:01.441
Actually, I do.

10:01.465 --> 10:02.833
And Hemmigen will pay.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.488
I'll send coordinates
from an encrypted account,

10:05.512 --> 10:07.698
so don't bother trying to track me down.

10:07.722 --> 10:09.492
Drop the money in four hours.

10:16.182 --> 10:18.240
He's not our guy.

10:18.264 --> 10:20.939
Then why did you agree to give

10:20.963 --> 10:24.377
"not our guy" $50 million?

10:24.401 --> 10:27.554
50 million in Bitcoin
would make sense, but cash?

10:27.578 --> 10:30.557
This is not amateur hour.
This is a mass casualty event.

10:30.581 --> 10:32.124
If the real killer wanted money,

10:32.148 --> 10:33.342
they would have threatened murder,

10:33.366 --> 10:34.604
not gone through with it.

10:34.628 --> 10:37.433
Whoever's behind this
wants people to die.

10:37.457 --> 10:39.000
So then how do you explain the fact

10:39.024 --> 10:41.046
that he's known some
of the poisoned batch numbers?

10:41.070 --> 10:44.266
I don't know if he's
an accomplice, a piggybacker,

10:44.290 --> 10:46.660
or a useful idiot, but he has
information that we need.

10:46.684 --> 10:48.531
Arranging the drop and then following him

10:48.555 --> 10:51.360
to a second location is our best
chance to track the real killer.

10:51.801 --> 10:54.798
And he's right: Hemmigen will pay.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.248
Tell that to the board of directors.

10:56.272 --> 10:57.497
I don't know how I'm gonna
get them to release

10:57.521 --> 10:59.107
that much money in four hours.

10:59.131 --> 11:00.654
Well, do the best you can.

11:10.490 --> 11:13.556
Subject has turned onto a private road.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.994
Eric.

11:16.018 --> 11:17.410
Oh, thanks.

11:18.368 --> 11:22.000
You know, you never, uh,
did answer my question.

11:22.024 --> 11:24.542
About how long it's been going
on between you and Kate.

11:25.505 --> 11:26.795
Couple months.

11:27.464 --> 11:28.963
You know, I didn't mean
what I said about it

11:28.987 --> 11:30.443
not being serious.

11:30.467 --> 11:32.217
So it is serious.

11:32.947 --> 11:36.971
- It's, uh... complicated.
- Hmm.

11:39.345 --> 11:41.810
Subject's car has now stopped.

11:43.349 --> 11:44.813
He's getting out.

11:56.101 --> 11:58.906
Units five and six moving into position.

11:58.930 --> 12:00.312
Six in position.

12:00.336 --> 12:04.346
Well, he got his money. $50 million.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.609
How much do you think that weighs?

12:06.633 --> 12:08.253
1,100 pounds.

12:10.380 --> 12:11.923
I looked it up.

12:18.515 --> 12:19.753
You know what, I'm gonna call Wendy.

12:19.777 --> 12:21.102
She's gonna want to see this.

12:21.126 --> 12:22.934
Oh, yeah, good idea.

12:24.738 --> 12:26.716
All units standing by.

12:26.740 --> 12:28.501
Standing by.

12:29.274 --> 12:30.570
Hmm, voice mail.

12:51.113 --> 12:53.047
He's going inside the cabin.

12:53.071 --> 12:55.595
No sign of anyone else.

13:08.869 --> 13:10.108
All units, move in.

13:24.189 --> 13:25.688
He was killed?

13:25.712 --> 13:27.864
Forensics thinks someone cut
the gas line at the cabin.

13:27.888 --> 13:30.302
- Anyone inside?
- It was empty.

13:30.326 --> 13:31.477
So our only lead is dead.

13:31.501 --> 13:33.043
We did manage to I.D. the guy:

13:33.067 --> 13:34.262
Bruce Kaplansky.

13:34.286 --> 13:36.569
He worked at Hemmigen in quality control.

13:36.593 --> 13:38.527
Well, if he had an accomplice,
I want him in here.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.219
All known associates, too.

13:45.391 --> 13:49.190
The cabin blew up? What about the money?

13:49.214 --> 13:50.800
Most of it was destroyed.

13:50.824 --> 13:52.541
How am I supposed to explain
that to the board of directors?

13:52.565 --> 13:55.327
Forensics are scouring
the wreckage for DNA.

13:55.351 --> 13:56.589
They will find out who did this.

13:56.613 --> 13:58.863
Well, at least he can't hurt
any more people.

14:00.876 --> 14:03.724
Whoever blew up that cabin
is the real Insulin Killer.

14:04.055 --> 14:06.425
- You think Bruce had an accomplice?
- No.

14:06.449 --> 14:07.861
An accomplice would have gotten the money

14:07.885 --> 14:09.123
and then killed Bruce.

14:09.147 --> 14:10.385
I think whoever did this

14:10.409 --> 14:11.473
was trying to prevent Bruce
from revealing

14:11.497 --> 14:13.301
what he knew about the poisonings.

14:13.325 --> 14:16.145
Then why not kill him before
the call? Why risk the exposure?

14:16.169 --> 14:18.480
Because the killer didn't know
who Bruce was until they heard

14:18.504 --> 14:20.426
his voice on the call.

14:21.078 --> 14:23.355
Do you think the killer
intercepted the call somehow?

14:23.379 --> 14:25.487
The line was secure. If they
were tapping it, we'd know.

14:25.511 --> 14:29.317
No, I think the killer was in this room.

14:30.228 --> 14:31.942
You think the killer was here?

14:31.966 --> 14:33.539
They knew about the drop

14:33.563 --> 14:35.976
and had access to Hemmigen's
production floor

14:36.000 --> 14:37.369
at the time of the tampering.

14:37.393 --> 14:39.371
Now, there's only one
person I can think of

14:39.395 --> 14:40.787
who fits that criteria.

14:43.660 --> 14:44.811
Wendy.

14:44.835 --> 14:46.726
Everyone on the call was accounted for

14:46.750 --> 14:49.903
at the time of the drop except for Wendy.

14:49.927 --> 14:52.732
I did try calling her.
It went straight to voice mail.

14:52.756 --> 14:56.214
And she did insist on being on that call.

14:56.238 --> 14:58.207
I think she recognized Bruce's voice.

14:58.231 --> 15:02.132
And she said, "You don't know
who you're dealing with."

15:02.156 --> 15:03.291
She was angry.

15:03.315 --> 15:05.614
Yeah, I don't think she was
talking about Hemmigen.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.423
I think she was talking about herself.

15:20.975 --> 15:24.520
The insulin shortage has led
to mass panic nationwide

15:24.544 --> 15:27.697
as emergency rooms find
themselves overrun with patients

15:27.721 --> 15:31.788
in diabetic ketoacidosis,
a potentially deadly condition.

15:31.812 --> 15:34.008
Drug companies are in a race against time

15:34.032 --> 15:35.923
to meet the demand for insulin.

15:35.947 --> 15:37.315
We're bringing in
everyone Bruce talked to

15:37.339 --> 15:38.795
in the last 48 hours.

15:38.819 --> 15:41.799
I want to talk to Wendy Vaughan.
I think she's involved.

15:42.344 --> 15:44.061
Are you insane?

15:44.085 --> 15:45.672
She's not some disgruntled employee.

15:45.696 --> 15:47.587
She's the VP of risk management.

15:47.611 --> 15:49.110
You have no cause to arrest her.

15:49.134 --> 15:51.199
I don't want to arrest her,
I just want to interview her.

15:51.223 --> 15:52.679
Reason being?

15:53.019 --> 15:55.333
Multiple tampered batches
point to an inside job,

15:55.357 --> 15:57.205
and she has high-level security clearance

15:57.229 --> 15:59.120
that gives her access
to the production floor.

15:59.144 --> 16:01.209
She also happens to be
married to a senator,

16:01.233 --> 16:03.603
who happens to be on the
FBI's oversight committee.

16:03.627 --> 16:05.213
I know it's a big ask.

16:05.237 --> 16:07.607
No, it's more than a big ask.
It's a political minefield.

16:07.631 --> 16:09.913
All I'm thinking about right now
are the 700,000 diabetics

16:09.937 --> 16:11.872
who are in desperate need
of safe insulin.

16:11.896 --> 16:14.091
Two more deaths from poisoning
have been reported.

16:14.115 --> 16:15.223
A different batch.

16:15.247 --> 16:17.336
That brings the body count to 12.

16:19.947 --> 16:22.709
Okay, you can talk to Wendy,
but on one condition.

16:22.733 --> 16:24.362
I will be in the box with you.

16:24.386 --> 16:27.148
- Deal.
- Donovan needs to sign off on it first.

16:27.631 --> 16:29.285
I'm sure he'll love the idea.

16:38.118 --> 16:40.683
Pending Donovan's approval, we're in.

16:40.707 --> 16:42.946
You and Wendy have a history,
so I'm gonna need you in my ear.

16:42.970 --> 16:45.558
I'm still trying to wrap
my head around the idea

16:45.582 --> 16:48.212
that she could actually be the killer.

16:48.236 --> 16:50.201
We used to play beer pong together.

16:51.370 --> 16:54.479
Zara, check out Hemmigen's
production floor.

16:54.503 --> 16:57.091
See if you can find a connection
between Wendy and Bruce, please.

16:57.115 --> 16:58.668
Okay, I'm on it.

16:59.683 --> 17:00.964
What do I need to know about her?

17:00.988 --> 17:03.967
Well, she's scary-smart,
competitive as hell.

17:03.991 --> 17:07.398
Her favorite topic of
conversation is herself.

17:07.423 --> 17:09.493
She was fun to spar with.
Life of the party.

17:09.518 --> 17:11.060
But I don't know,
whenever we were together,

17:11.085 --> 17:13.586
we just never really connected.

17:13.609 --> 17:15.413
- And she ended it?
- Yeah.

17:15.436 --> 17:17.154
One day, out of nowhere.

17:17.178 --> 17:19.679
She never told me why.
I never figured it out.

17:20.314 --> 17:22.203
Donovan's on board...

17:22.227 --> 17:23.986
as long as your questions
stick to Hemmigen.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.597
So be careful what you say in there.

17:26.248 --> 17:27.465
Let's do this.

17:32.540 --> 17:33.822
I heard you wanted to see me.

17:33.846 --> 17:35.345
Do you have any news on the killer?

17:35.369 --> 17:36.999
Please have a seat.

17:37.540 --> 17:39.349
We just want to make sure
we've covered everything

17:39.373 --> 17:41.627
regarding Hemmigen in this case.

17:42.986 --> 17:45.573
You work in risk management, right?

17:45.597 --> 17:47.183
Wh-What does that entail, exactly?

17:47.207 --> 17:50.709
I identify the possible risks
associated with a product

17:50.733 --> 17:53.189
or with the process used
to develop, manufacture

17:53.213 --> 17:54.234
and distribute it.

17:54.258 --> 17:55.888
That's a massive responsibility.

17:55.912 --> 17:58.499
I oversee a multifaceted
framework that liaises

17:58.523 --> 18:00.675
between corporate compliance,
the business team,

18:00.699 --> 18:02.024
and the legal department.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.460
You must know a lot
about how Hemmigen works,

18:03.484 --> 18:04.723
the ins and outs.

18:04.747 --> 18:06.725
Do you have access
to the production floor?

18:07.695 --> 18:09.379
Yes, of course. Why?

18:09.403 --> 18:10.990
Well, what I'm getting at,
Wendy, is that sometimes

18:11.014 --> 18:13.949
we know things without even
knowing that we know them.

18:14.994 --> 18:16.386
You think I'm involved.

18:16.410 --> 18:19.346
We're just covering all our bases.

18:19.370 --> 18:20.869
How dare you?

18:20.893 --> 18:22.044
Oh, no, we're not
accusing you of anything.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.306
We're just having a conversation here.

18:23.330 --> 18:26.222
This is a national disaster.

18:26.246 --> 18:29.399
The FBI and your little outfit...
Crisis Resolution, is it?

18:29.423 --> 18:31.271
I'm sure you have limited resources,

18:31.295 --> 18:33.099
so why are you wasting
precious time on me?

18:33.846 --> 18:35.841
Someone's getting defensive.

18:35.865 --> 18:38.476
You dated her. I don't see it.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.541
What can I say? It was college.

18:40.937 --> 18:42.438
I also LARPed.

18:43.046 --> 18:44.588
LARPed?

18:44.612 --> 18:46.068
Live-action role-play?

18:47.109 --> 18:48.201
Never mind.

18:48.225 --> 18:50.246
I convinced the board of directors

18:50.270 --> 18:52.292
to release $50 million,

18:52.316 --> 18:54.381
only to have that money blown up,

18:54.405 --> 18:56.078
for which I have you to thank.

18:56.102 --> 18:58.254
What did you do after the board meeting?

18:58.278 --> 19:00.430
I called my husband in D.C.

19:00.454 --> 19:02.781
He spent an hour consoling me.

19:02.805 --> 19:04.043
So, if it's an alibi you're after,

19:04.067 --> 19:05.348
check my phone records.

19:05.372 --> 19:07.445
She's making this tragedy all about her.

19:07.469 --> 19:10.223
Exaggerated sense of self-importance.

19:10.247 --> 19:12.834
Self-entitlement.
Wendy's definitely a narcissist.

19:12.858 --> 19:14.974
Eric, ask her about the victims.

19:14.998 --> 19:16.533
I noticed you haven't
mentioned the victims

19:16.557 --> 19:17.578
of the Insulin Killer.

19:17.602 --> 19:19.069
What's that supposed to mean?

19:19.093 --> 19:21.408
12 people are dead,
hospitals are full of patients

19:21.432 --> 19:22.583
in diabetic comas.

19:22.607 --> 19:24.803
You don't think that's been on my mind?

19:24.827 --> 19:26.456
It's all I think about.

19:26.480 --> 19:29.285
She's calm, no signs of anxiety.

19:29.309 --> 19:31.374
Well, she's definitely acting upset.

19:31.398 --> 19:33.080
Emphasis on "acting."

19:33.104 --> 19:35.199
Her metrics aren't matching her words.

19:35.979 --> 19:37.260
If she doesn't like being accused,

19:37.285 --> 19:39.960
why doesn't she just leave
or call her husband?

19:40.246 --> 19:42.037
Get a lawyer?

19:42.061 --> 19:45.693
Because she is enjoying this.

19:45.717 --> 19:47.501
She likes the attention.

19:48.764 --> 19:50.654
What are you doing?

19:50.678 --> 19:52.258
Profiling.

19:53.634 --> 19:56.704
Eric, I found a connection
between Bruce and Wendy.

19:56.728 --> 19:59.925
Someone filed a complaint
about Bruce to Wendy

19:59.949 --> 20:02.754
for smoking on the production floor.

20:02.778 --> 20:04.451
You knew Bruce Kaplansky.

20:04.475 --> 20:05.626
Not well.

20:05.650 --> 20:07.106
I understand he was reported to you

20:07.130 --> 20:08.847
for smoking on the production floor.

20:08.871 --> 20:10.413
I find that interesting.

20:10.437 --> 20:12.285
That Bruce was a smoker?

20:12.309 --> 20:13.634
That you knew.

20:13.658 --> 20:15.375
Which is why you cut
the gas lines in his cabin

20:15.399 --> 20:16.811
and turned it into a death trap.

20:16.835 --> 20:18.770
Eric, stick to Hemmigen.

20:18.794 --> 20:20.859
I agreed to this meeting
to answer your questions,

20:20.883 --> 20:22.338
not to be accused of murder.

20:22.362 --> 20:24.310
The longer we sit here,
the more people die.

20:24.335 --> 20:25.563
Eric.

20:27.001 --> 20:28.711
You two are dating, aren't you?

20:30.880 --> 20:33.436
I wonder what my husband
will have to say about that.

20:34.133 --> 20:36.507
It's a conflict of interest.

20:38.346 --> 20:40.661
Be careful, though, hon. I heard him say

20:40.685 --> 20:42.948
it's not serious between you two.

20:45.914 --> 20:48.023
Please be aware,
because of increased security,

20:48.047 --> 20:49.702
you must keep your passes
with you at all times.

20:49.727 --> 20:50.941
How's it going?

20:53.194 --> 20:55.160
What'd I miss?

20:55.184 --> 20:56.858
Did you dig up anything else on Wendy?

20:56.882 --> 20:58.617
She was on the phone with her husband

20:58.641 --> 21:00.328
for over an hour after the board meeting.

21:00.352 --> 21:02.777
- So her alibi checks out.
- Not necessarily.

21:02.801 --> 21:05.997
She called from her Hemmigen
number, but it was a VolP call.

21:06.021 --> 21:08.261
- VolP?
- Voice over IP.

21:08.285 --> 21:09.439
An Internet call.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.592
Service providers don't keep
records of user data,

21:11.616 --> 21:14.464
so the calls are
notoriously hard to trace.

21:14.488 --> 21:16.075
She could've been calling
from her office,

21:16.099 --> 21:17.250
but she also could've been

21:17.274 --> 21:18.555
calling en route to Bruce's cabin.

21:18.579 --> 21:20.427
She's using her husband as a shield.

21:20.451 --> 21:22.907
I found another interesting nugget:

21:22.931 --> 21:24.300
for Hemmigen to save face,

21:24.324 --> 21:25.780
someone's head's gonna have to roll,

21:25.804 --> 21:28.870
most likely the chief operating
officer Clark Mathison.

21:28.894 --> 21:31.220
And guess who's in line for his job.

21:31.244 --> 21:32.569
Wendy Vaughan.

21:32.593 --> 21:35.485
It doesn't surprise me.
Back in grad school,

21:35.509 --> 21:37.574
she had a little nickname:
Wisteria Wendy.

21:37.598 --> 21:40.360
- She was a climber.
- Grades, guys,

21:40.384 --> 21:42.013
and social status...
she did whatever it took

21:42.037 --> 21:43.406
to get whatever she wanted,

21:43.430 --> 21:45.800
and she didn't care who
she hurt along the way.

21:45.824 --> 21:47.715
At first I thought
she was just ambitious,

21:47.739 --> 21:49.630
but now I'm starting
to see something else,

21:49.654 --> 21:51.719
a specific psychological profile.

21:51.743 --> 21:53.286
What kind of profile?

21:53.310 --> 21:55.070
This.

21:55.506 --> 21:57.246
I think Wendy's a Dark Triad.

21:57.270 --> 22:00.075
Someone who presents
with three characteristics:

22:00.099 --> 22:01.946
narcissistic, ego-driven,

22:01.970 --> 22:04.253
psychopathic, lacking empathy,

22:04.277 --> 22:06.864
and Machiavellian, highly manipulative.

22:06.888 --> 22:08.953
Dark Triads are well educated

22:08.977 --> 22:11.130
and they move up fast
in the business world.

22:11.154 --> 22:12.365
So if what you're saying is true,

22:12.389 --> 22:14.394
then we should detain her and
conduct a formal interrogation.

22:14.418 --> 22:16.352
Your typical tactics won't
work with a Dark Triad.

22:16.376 --> 22:18.441
She has no empathy and
her defenses are up.

22:18.465 --> 22:20.530
- What's her weakness?
- She doesn't have any.

22:20.554 --> 22:22.097
Unless you count her competitive streak.

22:22.121 --> 22:23.359
I mean, the girl loves to win.

22:23.383 --> 22:25.405
So let's let her think she's won.

22:25.429 --> 22:27.494
You know, if I could get her on her turf,

22:27.518 --> 22:29.800
where she's in control,
and get her sparring again,

22:29.824 --> 22:31.411
like we did back in grad school,

22:31.435 --> 22:33.239
maybe I could get her
to let something slip.

22:33.263 --> 22:34.805
If you could get her to implicate herself

22:34.829 --> 22:36.416
in the insulin murders,
we could leverage her

22:36.440 --> 22:38.125
to reveal the remaining batches.

22:38.149 --> 22:40.217
Yeah, what exactly are you proposing?

22:41.271 --> 22:42.509
We let Wendy go.

22:43.512 --> 22:45.860
Donovan just approved
getting her in here.

22:45.884 --> 22:47.514
He's not gonna be on board
with letting her go,

22:47.538 --> 22:49.733
especially now... she's a flight risk.

22:49.757 --> 22:51.344
You know as well as I do,
we don't have a lot of time.

22:51.368 --> 22:53.370
This is the best strategy
we have to get her to crack.

22:57.318 --> 22:58.742
I'm really sorry this happened.

22:58.766 --> 23:01.049
They had no right
to question you like that.

23:01.073 --> 23:03.269
I get that they were doing
their due diligence,

23:03.293 --> 23:04.574
but it was humiliating.

23:04.598 --> 23:06.272
To imply that I was somehow involved...

23:06.296 --> 23:09.288
I told Eric it was ridiculous.
I was overruled.

23:09.864 --> 23:12.756
Well, thanks for sticking up
for me, but it's too late.

23:12.780 --> 23:14.585
Hemmigen put me on leave.

23:15.087 --> 23:17.504
- For how long?
- Indefinitely.

23:18.308 --> 23:21.591
All I want to do is stop
this-this monster,

23:21.615 --> 23:23.767
and now I'm not even allowed
back in the building

23:23.791 --> 23:25.619
until the investigation is resolved.

23:27.926 --> 23:29.295
How about a drink?

23:29.319 --> 23:32.950
I'm sure you could
use one right about now.

23:32.974 --> 23:34.474
You know, when I saw you today,

23:34.498 --> 23:37.433
I got to say, it, uh, it was nice.

23:37.457 --> 23:39.783
I've been feeling
pretty rough since things

23:39.807 --> 23:41.987
fell apart with Maxine, and, uh,

23:42.854 --> 23:45.824
seeing you reminded me
of the good old days.

23:46.988 --> 23:48.661
Oliver.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.045
You know what?

23:59.232 --> 24:01.820
A drink is probably not a bad idea.

24:01.845 --> 24:03.605
Why don't you come over
for a glass of wine?

24:03.882 --> 24:06.078
Okay. Let's do it.

24:06.103 --> 24:07.596
Great.

24:15.539 --> 24:17.125
You think Wendy's onto him?

24:17.149 --> 24:20.607
If she's as smart as he says
she is, I wouldn't be surprised.

24:20.631 --> 24:22.609
Donovan was okay with this?

24:22.633 --> 24:24.765
I don't know. I didn't ask him.

24:26.201 --> 24:28.441
I didn't want to take the chance
he'd say no.

24:28.465 --> 24:30.617
And when he finds out?

24:30.641 --> 24:33.533
We incriminate Wendy, it won't matter.

24:34.456 --> 24:35.883
Right.

24:35.907 --> 24:37.101
Your team find any connection

24:37.125 --> 24:38.625
between Wendy and the poisonings?

24:38.649 --> 24:40.104
Not yet.

24:40.128 --> 24:41.367
Wendy better be guilty.

24:41.391 --> 24:43.194
I'd feel awful
for snooping in her office.

24:43.218 --> 24:44.370
There's no record of Wendy

24:44.394 --> 24:46.981
even setting foot
on the production floor.

24:47.005 --> 24:48.722
So, um...

24:49.138 --> 24:50.854
Eric and Kate, huh?

24:50.878 --> 24:53.814
- Looks like it.
- Interesting.

24:54.226 --> 24:56.239
Interesting that they're together, or...

24:56.263 --> 24:58.153
Interesting that the same employee

24:58.177 --> 25:00.821
swiped in on Hemmigen's
production floor every time

25:00.845 --> 25:02.609
the contaminated batches
were shipped out.

25:02.633 --> 25:03.675
Who?

25:03.699 --> 25:07.721
An employee by the name
of Lisa Mansfield.

25:09.030 --> 25:10.659
Who is Lisa Mansfield?

25:12.244 --> 25:14.138
Wow.

25:14.162 --> 25:16.924
Nice digs. Thanks.

25:16.948 --> 25:19.318
Peter insisted on a gourmet kitchen.

25:19.342 --> 25:20.754
You know me, I can barely fry an egg,

25:20.778 --> 25:23.714
but I lucked out
nabbing a hubby who cooks.

25:24.477 --> 25:26.717
Let me grab something
from the wine cellar.

25:29.395 --> 25:32.331
Eric, she has a toll transponder
in her car.

25:32.355 --> 25:34.115
Good eye, Oliver.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.639
Did your people track Wendy's car?

25:36.663 --> 25:38.162
If she drove to Bruce's
cabin, she would've

25:38.186 --> 25:40.164
passed through some highway
tolls; we could prove it.

25:40.188 --> 25:42.713
Her car was parked
at Hemmigen all afternoon.

25:44.454 --> 25:47.346
Peter claims cooking helps him relax,

25:47.370 --> 25:50.111
a concept I will never understand.

25:55.371 --> 25:57.443
If it were up to me, it would be
takeout every night of the week.

25:57.467 --> 25:58.705
Yeah, well, you were the queen

25:58.729 --> 26:00.663
of microwave ramen, back in the day.

26:00.687 --> 26:02.947
Mr. Noodle. You remember.

26:05.047 --> 26:06.321
To old friends.

26:06.345 --> 26:08.478
To old friends.

26:10.677 --> 26:11.935
Mmm.

26:11.959 --> 26:15.809
Oh, God, I still can't believe
they actually think it was me.

26:15.833 --> 26:17.245
Everyone was on edge

26:17.269 --> 26:19.160
and it got out of hand, that's all.

26:19.184 --> 26:22.013
You're right. Let's talk
about something else.

26:23.173 --> 26:25.847
Hostage negotiation, huh?
Never saw that coming.

26:25.871 --> 26:28.415
Yeah, yeah, I guess
it is kind of different.

26:28.439 --> 26:30.374
But you, you know, I'd always figured

26:30.398 --> 26:33.290
you'd be running your own
private practice by now.

26:33.314 --> 26:34.500
Why Hemmigen?

26:34.993 --> 26:37.076
Oh, I was getting an award

26:37.100 --> 26:39.470
at some conference, and Hemmigen

26:39.494 --> 26:41.472
swooped in and wined and dined me.

26:41.496 --> 26:43.038
At the end of the day, their comp

26:43.062 --> 26:44.388
was just too good to turn down.

26:44.412 --> 26:46.651
Of course, who knows
what's next for me there.

26:47.339 --> 26:49.717
Do you know if they have any
new leads or suspects?

26:49.742 --> 26:51.177
I have a theory, actually.

26:51.468 --> 26:55.136
You remember, back in grad
school, a psychological profile

26:55.160 --> 26:57.009
that we studied called the Dark Triad?

26:57.033 --> 26:58.793
Seems like a stretch, no?

26:58.817 --> 27:00.447
You know, Triads want to cause damage

27:00.471 --> 27:02.449
on an epic scale.

27:02.473 --> 27:04.538
What better way than to target
a massive drug company?

27:04.562 --> 27:06.801
Largest supplier of
insulin in the country.

27:06.825 --> 27:08.194
Seriously, Oliver?

27:08.218 --> 27:10.351
How many Dark Triads
have you ever actually met?

27:13.179 --> 27:15.486
I think she's taking the bait.

27:17.870 --> 27:20.796
I'm sorry about
what Wendy overheard me say.

27:22.058 --> 27:23.775
About it not being serious between us.

27:24.334 --> 27:25.919
Don't worry about it.

27:26.497 --> 27:28.672
It's not that serious for me either.

27:29.370 --> 27:31.043
We're just having fun, right?

27:31.067 --> 27:32.301
Right.

27:33.042 --> 27:34.873
You know, th-there is something

27:34.897 --> 27:36.483
that I've been wondering all these years.

27:36.507 --> 27:37.806
What's that?

27:38.204 --> 27:39.834
Why did you ghost on me?

27:40.642 --> 27:42.402
Aw, have you really been

27:42.426 --> 27:44.274
thinking about me all these years?

27:44.298 --> 27:46.982
I mean, you never did give me
a reason why you broke it off.

27:48.345 --> 27:50.758
Well, I guess, after I won
the Brighton Fellowship,

27:50.782 --> 27:52.804
I got too busy for a relationship.

27:52.828 --> 27:54.762
Oh, right, I forgot you won that.

27:54.786 --> 27:56.895
Lucky, I guess. The competition
was pretty stiff.

27:56.919 --> 27:58.505
Yeah, you asked me to lobby for you

27:58.529 --> 28:01.378
because I knew Professor Stanton
on the selection committee,

28:01.788 --> 28:06.121
and I wasn't supposed to,
but I did, and you won,

28:06.145 --> 28:08.733
and then you dumped me the next day.

28:08.757 --> 28:10.387
Yeah, it tracks.

28:10.631 --> 28:12.084
What tracks?

28:12.108 --> 28:13.509
You used me.

28:14.415 --> 28:16.828
Like you're probably using
your senator husband now.

28:17.763 --> 28:19.396
Where's this coming from?

28:19.420 --> 28:21.398
Are you jealous or something?

28:21.422 --> 28:23.269
Did he get you the job at Hemmigen?

28:23.293 --> 28:25.140
Because I looked into you, Wendy.

28:25.164 --> 28:26.577
They didn't wine and dine you.

28:26.601 --> 28:28.840
In fact, you had to apply
for the job three times

28:28.864 --> 28:31.059
before they would even
give you an interview.

28:31.083 --> 28:32.626
What, are you stalking me now?

28:32.650 --> 28:34.454
Only a Triad would have the discipline

28:34.478 --> 28:36.326
to set a long game plan into action.

28:36.823 --> 28:38.153
Stake out a company,

28:38.177 --> 28:40.112
move up the ranks
until they got a position

28:40.136 --> 28:42.027
with a high-level security clearance.

28:42.621 --> 28:44.377
You're playing me.

28:44.831 --> 28:46.074
And not very well.

28:46.098 --> 28:48.686
I knew it the moment
you suggested a drink.

28:48.710 --> 28:50.775
You never were very good at pretending.

28:51.505 --> 28:54.474
You were so happy-go-lucky
in grad school,

28:54.498 --> 28:57.327
but you're different now.

28:59.373 --> 29:01.960
Clearly dealing with
some personal issues.

29:02.917 --> 29:04.092
Is it that Maxine?

29:04.964 --> 29:06.725
She must've really done a number on you.

29:06.902 --> 29:08.053
Don't bring her into this.

29:08.077 --> 29:10.142
She broke up with you, didn't she?

29:10.166 --> 29:11.448
And it crushed you.

29:11.472 --> 29:13.928
Just like you were crushed
when I dumped you.

29:13.952 --> 29:15.495
He's letting things get personal.

29:16.071 --> 29:17.497
Something's wrong.

29:17.521 --> 29:19.107
But to take your petty little grudge

29:19.131 --> 29:21.414
and actually accuse me of this atrocity

29:21.438 --> 29:23.111
is beyond pathetic.

29:23.135 --> 29:25.070
It's sociopathic.

29:25.497 --> 29:26.922
I want you to leave.

29:28.532 --> 29:30.316
Wendy.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.345
What'd you put in my drink?

29:39.369 --> 29:41.129
You can't leave well enough
alone, can you?

29:41.153 --> 29:44.437
Don't tell me you
stalked Maxine like this, too.

29:44.891 --> 29:46.221
Oliver.

29:46.245 --> 29:48.789
Can you hear me? Oliver?

29:48.813 --> 29:50.686
I looked into you, too, you know.

29:51.398 --> 29:53.775
Found a police report about the shooting.

29:56.716 --> 29:58.277
What was that like?

29:59.537 --> 30:01.236
Dale! Do it now!

30:03.524 --> 30:05.415
Did Maxine go to jail?

30:05.439 --> 30:07.634
No. No, it wasn't her fault.

30:07.658 --> 30:09.331
It was your fault, wasn't it?

30:09.355 --> 30:12.669
You put her in that terrible position.

30:13.272 --> 30:15.512
Whatever room they walked into
must be jamming the signal.

30:15.536 --> 30:17.507
She's leading him into a trap.

30:23.065 --> 30:26.131
You know, an experience like
that can have lasting effects.

30:26.155 --> 30:28.481
Post-traumatic stress syndrome.

30:28.505 --> 30:30.012
You've got all the signs.

30:48.525 --> 30:50.301
I couldn't protect her.

30:50.325 --> 30:53.207
That's right.
And it destroyed her, didn't it?

30:53.231 --> 30:55.930
She had to kill someone to save you.

30:55.954 --> 30:57.589
No wonder she left you.

30:58.361 --> 31:00.929
You made her a murderer.

31:05.150 --> 31:06.563
No.

31:06.587 --> 31:09.217
She's not a murderer. You are.

31:09.241 --> 31:10.852
I know you did it.

31:13.289 --> 31:15.232
Put the gun down, Oliver.

31:16.510 --> 31:18.527
Let's talk about this.

31:19.382 --> 31:21.447
We're friends, remember?

31:23.255 --> 31:24.798
Oliver.

31:26.041 --> 31:28.019
Help me!

31:28.043 --> 31:31.002
I can't believe you shot me.

31:34.876 --> 31:37.295
Drop the gun, Oliver.

31:40.152 --> 31:41.913
- Put the gun down.
- He shot me.

31:41.938 --> 31:43.983
He tried to kill me.

31:54.682 --> 31:56.791
You released her...
bent my arm to get her in here.

31:56.815 --> 31:58.140
What the hell were you thinking, Barrett?

31:58.164 --> 32:00.055
Don't even get me started about...

32:00.079 --> 32:02.188
The shortage of insulin has become acute.

32:02.212 --> 32:04.013
Hospitals are reporting an uptick

32:04.037 --> 32:06.486
in admissions
for diabetic-related symptoms.

32:06.510 --> 32:08.977
State and federal authorities
are encouraging people

32:09.001 --> 32:11.762
not to forgo their insulin
medication out of fear

32:11.786 --> 32:12.972
of contamination.

32:12.972 --> 32:14.428
I think you're too
distracted by your boyfriend.

32:14.452 --> 32:15.603
I don't want an explanation.

32:15.627 --> 32:17.039
You're off the case
pending a full review.

32:17.063 --> 32:19.065
- Sir, but...
- No. Get out!

32:26.725 --> 32:28.703
What did Donovan say?

32:28.727 --> 32:30.095
About what?

32:30.119 --> 32:32.402
Releasing someone
suspected of mass murder

32:32.426 --> 32:34.839
or the fact that one of
your team members shot her?

32:34.863 --> 32:36.493
Or maybe you're referring to him learning

32:36.517 --> 32:38.190
that you and I are an item?

32:38.214 --> 32:41.411
Because he addressed all three
topics, quite colorfully.

32:41.435 --> 32:43.544
Okay, I'm sorry.

32:43.568 --> 32:46.764
He's taken me off the case
pending further review.

32:46.788 --> 32:48.549
Look, I'm not blaming you.

32:48.573 --> 32:50.986
Letting Wendy go was my decision.

32:51.010 --> 32:53.632
But I think that this, whatever we are,

32:53.656 --> 32:55.405
might be clouding my judgment.

32:58.835 --> 33:01.101
You said your people
tracked Wendy's transponder,

33:01.125 --> 33:02.693
but did they track her husband's?

33:03.690 --> 33:05.091
I'm not sure.

33:06.968 --> 33:09.221
You're actually asking me
for another favor?

33:09.245 --> 33:12.118
Kate, I will fix all this, I promise.

33:15.977 --> 33:18.127
I can't believe I shot her.

33:18.939 --> 33:20.782
Well, thankfully, it's just a graze.

33:20.806 --> 33:23.045
She's gonna be fine.

33:23.069 --> 33:24.611
Thank you.

33:25.695 --> 33:27.876
Your drink wasspiked.

33:28.198 --> 33:30.530
Your blood tested
positive for scopolamine,

33:30.554 --> 33:33.316
an odorless, tasteless drug
that makes people vulnerable

33:33.340 --> 33:35.013
to suggestion. Victims have no memory

33:35.037 --> 33:36.493
of what happens to them
when they're on it.

33:36.517 --> 33:39.017
Wendy's pressing charges,
but if she drugged Oliver,

33:39.041 --> 33:40.671
that proves culpability, doesn't it?

33:40.695 --> 33:42.754
Her husband's on the oversight committee.

33:43.822 --> 33:45.800
It'll take more than that
for the FBI to move against her.

33:45.825 --> 33:47.846
Where did the gun even come from?

33:48.426 --> 33:49.660
It was mine.

33:50.836 --> 33:54.641
I-I got it a couple months ago,
but I never used it, I swear.

33:56.017 --> 33:57.435
Till today.

33:58.147 --> 33:59.646
What were you thinking?

34:00.846 --> 34:02.911
I don't know what's going on with me.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.783
What did you guys see
on the button cam feed?

34:06.069 --> 34:08.351
It cut out. We lost the signal.

34:08.375 --> 34:11.092
I'm gonna see if I can get
your cell phone out of evidence.

34:11.117 --> 34:13.902
Maybe there's something on there
that can help us.

34:16.996 --> 34:18.708
I know Wendy's the killer.

34:18.733 --> 34:21.146
Oh, we believe you.

34:21.170 --> 34:24.149
But Wendy never set foot
onto the production floor.

34:24.172 --> 34:26.150
There is one employee who was present

34:26.175 --> 34:28.007
when the poisoned batches
were shipped out.

34:29.175 --> 34:30.373
Who?

34:30.397 --> 34:32.114
Her name's Lisa Mansfield.

34:32.138 --> 34:34.159
She's the VP of quality control.

34:34.183 --> 34:35.420
Well, let's bring her in.

34:35.849 --> 34:37.554
We can't find her anywhere in the state.

34:37.578 --> 34:39.130
Yeah, that's because Lisa Mansfield

34:39.154 --> 34:40.382
doesn't work at Hemmigen.

34:40.407 --> 34:42.253
She's a paranoid schizophrenic

34:42.277 --> 34:44.656
at the Hillbrook Psychiatric Asylum.

34:44.679 --> 34:47.607
Wendy and I studied her case
in grad school.

34:48.320 --> 34:52.308
Well, Wendy created a fake
employee file for her.

34:52.331 --> 34:55.702
Pay history, security
clearance, the works.

34:55.726 --> 34:57.628
She must have swiped
onto the production floor

34:57.672 --> 34:58.649
as Lisa Mansfield

34:58.674 --> 35:00.118
when she poisoned the batches.

35:00.142 --> 35:01.404
The evidence is incriminating,

35:01.428 --> 35:03.449
but even if the Feds arrest Wendy,

35:03.473 --> 35:05.582
she won't give up the remaining
contaminated batch numbers.

35:06.059 --> 35:08.017
She wants people to die.

35:09.671 --> 35:12.544
There might be another way
to get her to talk.

35:24.814 --> 35:27.822
Have you come to apologize
for Oliver's behavior?

35:28.568 --> 35:30.825
No, no, I'm here because I have proof

35:30.849 --> 35:34.002
that you created Lisa
Mansfield's employee profile,

35:34.026 --> 35:36.656
which ties you to the insulin tampering.

35:36.680 --> 35:39.921
All that sounds like
is proof that I was framed.

35:39.945 --> 35:41.487
By Bruce, no doubt.

35:41.511 --> 35:43.668
One tip from me, and FBI techs

35:43.692 --> 35:45.468
will be digging into
your electronic fingerprint.

35:45.492 --> 35:47.649
Tracing Lisa Mansfield to you

35:47.673 --> 35:49.104
will be child's play for them.

35:49.128 --> 35:50.777
I don't know who you think you are...

35:50.801 --> 35:54.413
I'm a negotiator,
and I'm here to make a deal.

35:55.387 --> 35:58.013
None of the evidence that I have

35:58.037 --> 35:59.641
needs to come to light.

36:00.387 --> 36:02.757
If you give me
the remaining batch numbers

36:02.781 --> 36:04.938
and you drop the charges against Oliver,

36:05.784 --> 36:08.589
everyone will go their separate ways.

36:08.613 --> 36:10.895
He shot me. Do you understand that?

36:10.919 --> 36:12.897
I understand that you have no empathy.

36:12.921 --> 36:15.865
Something tells me that prison
won't suit you very well.

36:16.751 --> 36:18.773
If I gave you these batch numbers

36:18.797 --> 36:20.662
that you seem to think I have,

36:21.091 --> 36:23.069
that would constitute a confession.

36:23.094 --> 36:25.072
Not if they were sent
anonymously to the FBI

36:25.097 --> 36:27.640
from an encrypted e-mail account.

36:27.936 --> 36:30.721
The crisis would be averted,
you'd get promoted,

36:30.746 --> 36:32.724
and no one would be the wiser.

36:32.985 --> 36:36.660
If you've looked into me,
and I'm... I'm sure you have,

36:36.976 --> 36:38.674
you know I'm a man of my word.

36:39.741 --> 36:42.720
And if you're as brilliant
as you think you are,

36:43.517 --> 36:45.003
you know what I'm offering is

36:45.027 --> 36:46.479
your only way out of this.

37:04.625 --> 37:07.250
You know, not a lot of people
can do what I do.

37:08.543 --> 37:09.998
It takes a certain kind of person

37:10.022 --> 37:11.546
to work in risk management.

37:12.461 --> 37:14.483
People have accused me
of lacking empathy,

37:14.508 --> 37:19.445
but the truth is people like me
serve a necessary function.

37:21.373 --> 37:22.616
Do they?

37:23.022 --> 37:24.259
History has proven so.

37:24.284 --> 37:25.927
Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan.

37:25.951 --> 37:28.538
They were the ones
who made tough decisions.

37:28.562 --> 37:31.802
The greatest leaps in human progress

37:31.826 --> 37:33.717
were made by people like us.

37:33.741 --> 37:35.458
Psychopaths, you mean.

37:35.482 --> 37:37.072
I mean leaders.

37:38.267 --> 37:40.533
And we're not gonna sit idly by.

37:41.334 --> 37:44.579
When the asteroid hits
that decimates the population,

37:45.797 --> 37:48.800
we're the ones who will do
what needs to be done.

37:50.845 --> 37:53.607
I have seen a lot
of self-delusion in my time,

37:53.631 --> 37:55.347
but yours takes the cake.

37:55.371 --> 37:56.914
You just wanted those people to die

37:56.938 --> 37:58.843
so you could feel like you mattered.

38:00.289 --> 38:03.389
I'm here to tell you
that you don't matter, Wendy.

38:04.729 --> 38:06.351
And you never will.

38:09.864 --> 38:11.842
The FBI received an anonymous e-mail

38:11.866 --> 38:14.018
listing the remaining
tainted batch numbers.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.684
Hemmigen did a risk assessment
and determined that

38:16.709 --> 38:18.209
the casualty rate is actually higher

38:18.234 --> 38:20.777
if they don't start supplying
insulin than if they do.

38:21.049 --> 38:22.810
So they destroyed the batches on the list

38:22.834 --> 38:24.115
and terminated the recall.

38:24.139 --> 38:25.502
Well, that's great news.

38:25.526 --> 38:27.467
There's still a risk
that some of the batches

38:27.491 --> 38:28.729
out there could be poisoned.

38:28.753 --> 38:31.122
Self-preservation's a powerful motivator.

38:31.146 --> 38:33.647
If Wendy lied,
we'd find out and go after her.

38:33.671 --> 38:35.597
That woman does not want to rot in jail.

38:35.621 --> 38:36.998
Mm, maybe you're right.

38:37.022 --> 38:39.851
She did drop the charges against Oliver.

38:45.378 --> 38:47.772
We're really gonna let
a mass murderer walk.

38:56.041 --> 38:57.671
Wendy Vaughan, FBI.

38:57.695 --> 38:59.586
You're being placed under arrestHey!

38:59.610 --> 39:01.159
- For the murder of Bruce Kaplansky.
- Get off me.

39:01.183 --> 39:04.155
Don't touch me!
Do you know who my husband is?

39:04.179 --> 39:06.984
Let's go. You have the right
to remain silent.

39:07.008 --> 39:08.943
If you give up that right,
anything you say can and will

39:08.967 --> 39:10.684
be used against you in a court of law.

39:10.708 --> 39:12.686
You have the right to an attorney.

39:12.710 --> 39:13.861
If you cannot afford an attorney,

39:13.885 --> 39:15.468
one will be provided for you.

39:15.492 --> 39:17.168
You knew she'd get arrested.

39:17.192 --> 39:18.561
Well, I knew she killed Bruce.

39:18.585 --> 39:20.500
I just needed proof
that she drove to his cabin.

39:20.524 --> 39:22.594
Yeah, but her car was parked at Hemmigen.

39:23.459 --> 39:25.437
Ah, she drove her husband's car.

39:25.461 --> 39:27.515
We tracked it to a toll
road right by the cabin.

39:28.290 --> 39:31.313
Does Kate know you made
a deal with Wendy?

39:31.686 --> 39:33.062
No.

39:33.614 --> 39:35.356
She does not.

39:38.213 --> 39:40.304
Bruce piggybacked on Wendy's plan.

39:40.328 --> 39:42.273
Oh, you think he discovered
the poisoned insulin

39:42.297 --> 39:43.997
in quality control and didn't report it?

39:44.021 --> 39:45.545
He knew that Hemmigen would pay

39:45.569 --> 39:47.024
to contain the threat, and they did.

39:47.048 --> 39:49.026
But because Bruce wasn't
part of Wendy's plan,

39:49.050 --> 39:50.637
he became her weak link.

39:50.661 --> 39:53.683
Control freaks like Wendy
are terrible improvisers,

39:53.707 --> 39:56.512
which is why she forgot to
remove the toll transponder

39:56.536 --> 39:57.731
from her husband's car.

39:57.755 --> 39:59.361
We still have a problem.

39:59.385 --> 40:01.648
Even though Wendy dropped
the charges against Oliver,

40:01.672 --> 40:03.693
the FBI wants to investigate
the shooting.

40:03.717 --> 40:05.695
You guys may have lost the
button cam signal in the van,

40:05.719 --> 40:07.175
but the feed automatically downloaded

40:07.199 --> 40:08.611
to the phone in your pocket.

40:08.635 --> 40:10.308
Check it out.

40:10.332 --> 40:12.659
You can tell people whatever you want,

40:12.683 --> 40:14.661
but I don't think anyone
will believe you.

40:14.685 --> 40:16.483
Wendy, let go of the gun.

40:16.507 --> 40:18.229
She pulled the trigger.

40:18.253 --> 40:20.101
- I didn't shoot her?
- No.

40:20.125 --> 40:22.214
She shot herself.

40:23.650 --> 40:25.672
But why the gun, Oliver?

40:25.696 --> 40:30.379
After what happened with Maxine,
I just didn't feel safe.

40:30.403 --> 40:31.982
Why didn't you come to us?

40:32.006 --> 40:33.201
We could have talked about it.

40:33.225 --> 40:34.681
Yeah, I knew you wouldn't approve.

40:35.208 --> 40:36.793
I get it, I do.

40:38.143 --> 40:40.687
But in my experience,
the problem with carrying a gun

40:40.711 --> 40:43.148
is that eventually it will go off.

40:44.671 --> 40:46.649
I think I need help.

40:47.387 --> 40:49.937
We're here for you. Whatever you need.

40:53.288 --> 40:55.266
So when's your review happening?

40:55.290 --> 40:56.703
It's not.

40:56.727 --> 40:58.748
Donovan said I'll actually be
getting a commendation.

40:58.772 --> 41:00.576
Oh, congrats. Well deserved.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.186
He also said you gave me full credit

41:02.210 --> 41:04.101
for getting the batch numbers.

41:04.125 --> 41:06.408
How did you get Wendy to spill?

41:06.432 --> 41:08.408
You need a date for this ceremony?

41:09.435 --> 41:11.805
Thought it wasn't serious between us.

41:11.829 --> 41:14.914
Okay, look, I... I said
what I said because

41:15.397 --> 41:17.854
women I've been in relationships with,

41:17.878 --> 41:20.422
bad things happened to
them, because of me.

41:20.670 --> 41:22.422
So you're trying to protect me...

41:23.464 --> 41:24.731
by keeping me at arm's length?

41:24.755 --> 41:26.297
I know it's stupid, but...

41:26.321 --> 41:27.864
Yeah, it's stupid.

41:27.888 --> 41:31.472
So how about, from now on,
you let my safety be my call.

41:32.023 --> 41:34.242
I mean, you did ask out an FBI agent.

41:35.853 --> 41:38.614
Wait, I asked you out?
I distinctly remember you...

41:38.638 --> 41:39.900
Shut up, Beaumont.
