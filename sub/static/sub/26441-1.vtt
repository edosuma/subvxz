She smashed it with a hammer.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.118
Because you keyed my nearside door!

04:01.200 --> 04:02.680

04:09.800 --> 04:12.793
Thank you.
Can I suggest a simple solution?

04:13.120 --> 04:15.256
You pay for her cracked window,
you pay for her scratched door

04:15.280 --> 04:17.456
and we all agree that parking around
here is a nightmare

04:17.480 --> 04:19.576
but that grown-ups really shouldn't need
to call the police

04:19.600 --> 04:21.238

04:23.520 --> 04:25.000
Now, if we're all agreed on that,

04:25.120 --> 04:27.096
there's no need for me
to take any further police action

04:27.120 --> 04:29.635

13:15.840 --> 13:18.719
It was exploding
and then it dematerialised.

13:20.440 --> 13:22.033
Don't panic. Not the end of the world.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.914
Well, it could be the end of the world,
but one thing at a time.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.360
Are we supposed to understand
anything you're saying?

13:27.520 --> 13:30.319
- She thinks that thing is an alien.
- GRAHAM: Don't be daft.

13:30.400 --> 13:31.800
There's no such thing as aliens.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.656
Anyway, even if there was, they ain't
gonna be on a train in Sheffield.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.797
Why not? I'm alien and I'm here.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.229
Grace, we're going.

13:39.440 --> 13:40.510
No, we're not.

13:40.640 --> 13:43.917
- She just saved our lives.
- Don't be scared.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.077
All of this is new to you
and new can be scary.

13:46.160 --> 13:47.879
Now, we all want answers.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.952
Stick with me, you might get some.

13:50.480 --> 13:53.279
Actually, erm, I don't want answers.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.440
I just want to get to work
and forget all about this.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.273
If that's all right with everyone.

13:58.760 --> 14:02.037
Even if it isn't, thank you.

14:04.440 --> 14:07.194
- Would you like me to...
- No, thank you.

14:07.720 --> 14:11.600
I, er, just want to be on my own.
I'll walk.

14:11.760 --> 14:12.760
I need the air.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.633
And I'm with him.

14:15.720 --> 14:17.279
We don't get aliens in Sheffield.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.111
I think he's still in shock. Bless him.

14:22.920 --> 14:24.434
Obvious question,

14:24.520 --> 14:27.240
but has anyone noticed anything else
out of the ordinary tonight?

14:32.800 --> 14:35.269
I'm gonna be in such trouble
if they find out I was there.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.033
Can we have the lights and siren on?

14:37.120 --> 14:39.874
No! I shouldn't be doing any of this.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.394
So you three know each other?

14:41.480 --> 14:43.199
- I'm his nan, Graham's my husband.
- Ah.

14:43.320 --> 14:44.390
Second husband.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.954
And you two know each other.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.576
Yeah. Yaz and I were at school together.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.796
- Huh.
- Not Yasmin Khan?

14:49.880 --> 14:51.075
Hello, Ryan's nan.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.157
Haven't you done
well for yourself, love?

14:53.240 --> 14:55.096
And you say you just found it there,
this thing?

14:55.120 --> 14:56.190
Yeah, pretty much.

14:56.800 --> 14:59.474
- I took pictures.
- DOCTOR: (GASPS) Good lad.

15:00.640 --> 15:01.869
That's exciting.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.600
No. Not exciting. What do I mean?

15:05.360 --> 15:07.397
Worrying. Fast as you can, Yaz.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.475
RYAN: There's my bike.

15:14.920 --> 15:16.149
Why's it in a tree?

15:16.760 --> 15:18.513
We were up top and I chucked it over.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.393
He gets cross because he can't ride it.

15:20.480 --> 15:21.596
We're giving him lessons.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.837
He's got dyspraxia.
It's a coordination disorder.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.070
Anyway, enough about me.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.993
The tree's to the left,
so it should be...

15:30.040 --> 15:31.320
YASMIN: It was definitely there.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.953
So where's it gone?

16:32.760 --> 16:36.117
Rahul, if you're all right about that,
should we not tell someone?

16:38.360 --> 16:39.840
What good would that do?

16:41.400 --> 16:42.959
I'm worried for you, mate.

16:45.280 --> 16:46.634
I finally got it.

16:49.240 --> 16:51.675
Go on, mate. Have a pint on me.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.840
I'll see you Monday.
Pick you up at 8:00.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.156
(BREATH TREMBLES)

17:14.520 --> 17:16.272
- (CAMERA BEEPS)
- (SIGHS)

17:41.920 --> 17:45.800
Two weird things, one city, same night.
Makes me nervous.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.056
I'll see if there's been
any more reports on that object.

17:48.080 --> 17:50.356
Good, because we need
all the information we can get.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.596
Meet us back here.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.816
GRAHAM: I can have a word
with some of my old pals from work.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.776
I mean, if you want to know what's
happening, ask a bus driver.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.736
- He always says that.
- Yeah, that's because it is true.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.240
I'd still be doing it now if I could.

17:59.280 --> 18:01.317
I can search for weird stuff
on social media.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.376
And I'll check in with my nurses group
on WhatsApp.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.835
- Seriously though, aliens?
- Yup.

18:05.920 --> 18:07.593
Oh, yeah,
maybe I won't mention that bit.

18:07.680 --> 18:08.716
(CHUCKLES)

18:09.640 --> 18:13.350
Suddenly I feel really tired.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.960
That was a big fall you had, love.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.520
Should get you checked out at A&E.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.718
No. I never go anywhere
that's just initials.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.718
(GASPS) Although...

18:23.440 --> 18:25.159
(GROANS) Can one of you catch me?

18:25.240 --> 18:26.520
RYAN: You're going to fall over?

18:26.600 --> 18:28.273
In two minutes, 19 seconds. Wait!

18:28.360 --> 18:29.430
Forget the two minutes.

18:29.520 --> 18:31.876
Nineteen...
Oh, this new nose is so unreliable.

18:31.960 --> 18:32.960
(GASPS)

18:40.240 --> 18:41.913
Yaz, you've done your shift.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.117
Stop pestering
me for more interesting shouts.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.759
It's not that. I'm just wondering

18:45.840 --> 18:48.320
whether there's been anything else
out of the ordinary tonight?

18:49.040 --> 18:52.351
It's the night shift in Sheffield,
everything's out of the ordinary.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.872
I've got to ask you,
any talk of weird stuff

19:01.120 --> 19:03.112
or strange creatures out tonight?

19:03.880 --> 19:06.759
My wife's out with her mates at karaoke,
if that's what you mean.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.791
- (LAUGHING)
- (LAUGHS) Yeah.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.239
Not hear.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.589
Feel. Can you feel...

21:11.840 --> 21:12.876
Stay still, Ryan.

- What is it? What's the matter?

Yeah, I have. Okay.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.036
(INHALES SHARPLY)

21:33.120 --> 21:35.919
Really sorry. Not good news. DNA bombs.

21:36.560 --> 21:39.029
Microimplants which code to your DNA.

21:39.120 --> 21:42.113
On detonation, they disrupt
the foundation of your genetic code,

21:42.240 --> 21:43.390
melting your DNA.

Fast, and nasty and outlawed

21:47.200 --> 21:48.395
How did we get them?

21:48.480 --> 21:50.016
Never mind that,
are they going to go off?

21:50.040 --> 21:52.271
Quiet, I'm trying to think.
It's difficult.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.920
I'm not yet who I am.

21:56.160 --> 21:58.516
Brain and body still rebooting.

21:58.760 --> 22:00.080
Reformatting.

22:01.240 --> 22:03.038
Oh, reformatting!

22:03.600 --> 22:05.990
- Can I borrow that?
- Yeah, I guess so, but what for?

22:06.200 --> 22:08.271
That creature. On the train.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.869
When you two came onboard,
it zapped us all with these.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.470
Simple plan to take out witnesses.
Very clever.

the origin signal for the DNA bombs.

then stops to pull out a tooth?

25:58.520 --> 26:00.193

26:00.280 --> 26:02.590
Or it's done what it came here for.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.430
Some sort of transport chamber.

26:05.960 --> 26:08.520
Presumably for that thing we just saw
in the alley.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.876
But why here? Why tonight?

26:13.480 --> 26:15.153
Actually, that might have been me.

26:18.040 --> 26:20.760
Why? What did you do.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.873
When I went to get my bike,
there was this line in the air

26:24.960 --> 26:26.792
and then it moved and there were shapes.

26:27.600 --> 26:28.600
And?

26:29.760 --> 26:31.877
- And I touched one.
- Ryan.

26:32.480 --> 26:33.800
You all would have done the same.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.559
- I wouldn't.
- I would have.

26:36.360 --> 26:39.797
All right, the shapes disappeared.
A few seconds later that appeared.

26:41.640 --> 26:42.640
What have I done?

26:45.280 --> 26:46.919
Hard to say, really.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.401
I suppose you'll be blaming this
on the dyspraxia as well.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.472
Can't ride a bike,
started an alien invasion.

26:51.560 --> 26:52.560
- Graham.
- What?

26:52.640 --> 26:55.030
- Enough, love.
- All right, I made a mistake.

26:55.440 --> 26:58.239
But why did that guy move this thing
from the Peaks to here?

26:58.320 --> 27:00.391
And how did he even know
it was there?

27:01.520 --> 27:02.636
Good questions.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.913
Let's take a look around here,
see what we can find.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.150
Can't follow it.

27:09.240 --> 27:12.438
The tracking's been blocked,
like it figured out what I was doing.

27:12.600 --> 27:15.718
If we were tracking bomb signals
from that creature from the train,

27:16.360 --> 27:17.635
why did they lead us here?

27:18.360 --> 27:19.760
Another good question.

27:20.120 --> 27:23.238
I don't know. If I could analyse that...

27:23.320 --> 27:24.993
Course, what I really need is my...

27:25.080 --> 27:26.594
(GROANS)

27:27.360 --> 27:28.953
I could build one!

27:29.080 --> 27:32.278
I'm good at building things. Probably.

27:42.440 --> 27:43.954
It's not your fault, all this.

27:44.040 --> 27:45.394
Yeah, it basically is.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.400
You couldn't have known
that was going to happen.

27:47.440 --> 27:49.159
Maybe tell Graham that.

27:49.240 --> 27:50.799
He knows, really.

27:58.200 --> 27:59.873
Do you believe she's an alien?

28:01.240 --> 28:02.720
Yeah, I think I do, yeah.

28:03.520 --> 28:05.398

57:54.840 --> 57:55.956
How do you cope with that?

the world, they're never gone from me.

That's the sort of thing

everything we've lied to people about,

I should get back to finding my TARDIS.

58:39.120 --> 58:42.079
Doctor, can I just say

58:43.240 --> 58:44.960
you really need
to get out of those clothes.

Ah! Not that.

Yup.

a particular type of energy.

I've tracked that energy trail

Stenza technology is really annoying
