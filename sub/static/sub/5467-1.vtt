<i>I am a stone.</i>

01:41.058 --> 01:44.353
<i>I do not move.</i>

01:48.316 --> 01:53.029
<i>Very slowly,
I put snow in my mouth,</i>

01:53.821 --> 01:56.866
<i>then he won't
see my breath.</i>

02:04.457 --> 02:09.169
<i>I take my time.
I let him come closer.</i>

02:09.252 --> 02:13.049
<i>I have only one bullet.
I aim at his eye.</i>

02:13.466 --> 02:18.804
<i>Very gently, my finger
presses on the trigger.</i>

02:22.350 --> 02:26.562
<i>I do not tremble.</i>

02:26.771 --> 02:31.234
<i>I have no fear.
I'm a big boy now.</i>

02:36.155 --> 02:39.033
<i>Ready, Vassili?</i>

02:39.116 --> 02:41.911
Now, Vassili.
Fire!

02:41.994 --> 02:45.122
<i>Fire, Vassili!
Fire!</i>

03:43.723 --> 03:47.143
Come on, pick your feet up.

03:47.226 --> 03:50.646
<i>Get on your feet.
Prepare to board the train.</i>

03:58.654 --> 04:02.116
You there, come along with me now.
This way, pal.

04:04.452 --> 04:06.787
<i>All civilians, get out!</i>

04:06.871 --> 04:09.373
<i>Make way, let the civilians off.</i>

04:09.415 --> 04:11.709
<i>This is a military convoy.</i>

04:11.959 --> 04:17.531
<i>No one stays on board
but our valiant soldiers.</i>

04:17.548 --> 04:21.135
<i>This is a convoy
to Stalingrad...</i>

04:21.219 --> 04:24.680
<i>only for the soldiers
of the Red Army.</i>

04:44.283 --> 04:47.370
All aboard!

05:13.312 --> 05:15.481
<i>Autumn, 1942.</i>

05:15.565 --> 05:19.068
<i>Europe lies crushed
beneath the Nazi jackboot.</i>

05:22.154 --> 05:25.783
<i>The German Third Reich
is at the height of its power.</i>

05:25.867 --> 05:29.245
<i>Hitler's armies are charging
through the heart of the Soviet Union...</i>

05:29.328 --> 05:31.789
<i>towards the oil fields
of Asia.</i>

05:31.873 --> 05:35.418
<i>One last obstacle remains.
A city on the Volga...</i>

05:35.501 --> 05:39.630
<i>where the fate of the world
is being decided: Stalingrad.</i>

06:29.847 --> 06:31.682
Glorious comrade Stalin...

06:31.766 --> 06:35.603
<i>has ordered not another
step backwards.</i>

06:35.686 --> 06:39.857
The people of the Soviet Union
shall be free.

06:54.330 --> 06:58.292
<i>Go forward, comrades.
Not a step backwards!</i>

07:16.102 --> 07:19.313
<i>Listen to these letters
sent by Russian mothers...</i>

07:19.397 --> 07:22.525
<i>to their sons on the front.</i>

07:22.608 --> 07:27.738
<i>"Volodya, my child,
I know that it's for our motherland...</i>

07:31.117 --> 07:36.747
<i>"I know that it's for our motherland
that you are giving your life.</i>

07:51.971 --> 07:56.601
"Everyone here knows
that you will not fall back.

07:56.642 --> 07:59.729
"Everyone here
is proud of you.

08:01.439 --> 08:05.443
<i>"Your father is dead.
Your brothers are dead.</i>

08:05.484 --> 08:08.029
<i>Avenge us
on the hordes of fascists".</i>

08:45.858 --> 08:48.277
<i>Nobody move!
Stay on the boat!</i>

08:49.529 --> 08:51.489
Get back or I'll shoot!

08:51.531 --> 08:54.951
<i>Back from the rails, or we shoot.
Shoot the traitors!</i>

09:29.735 --> 09:33.155
Come on, come on!
Move!

09:35.074 --> 09:39.537
<i>Come on, comrades,
come on!</i>

09:39.579 --> 09:41.539
<i>Move, or you'll be shot!</i>

09:57.597 --> 10:01.058
<i>Over here, stretcher!</i>

10:06.147 --> 10:08.482
<i>The one with
the rifle shoots!</i>

10:08.566 --> 10:11.235
One out of two
gets a rifle.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.655
The one without
follows him!

10:14.739 --> 10:18.367
When the one
with the rifle gets killed,

10:18.451 --> 10:23.206
<i>the one who is following
picks up the rifle and shoots!</i>

10:23.289 --> 10:28.503
<i>The one with
the rifle shoots!</i>

10:28.586 --> 10:31.923
<i>The one without follows him!</i>

10:32.006 --> 10:34.717
When the one with
the rifle gets killed,

10:34.800 --> 10:37.261
<i>the one who is following...</i>

10:37.345 --> 10:41.390
<i>picks up the rifle and shoots!</i>

10:41.474 --> 10:43.434
<i>The one with
the rifle shoots!</i>

10:43.518 --> 10:48.523
<i>- This way, now.
- The one without follows him!</i>

11:11.295 --> 11:15.758
<i>Soldiers of the glorious
Red Army, from now on...</i>

11:15.842 --> 11:20.221
<i>it is either victory
or death!</i>

11:20.304 --> 11:24.308
<i>- Those who retreat will be shot.
- I need a rifle.</i>

11:24.392 --> 11:27.979
<i>There will be no mercy
for cowards and traitors!</i>

11:28.062 --> 11:31.148
<i>Achtung!</i>

13:18.005 --> 13:21.175
It's hopeless, comrades.
Get back!

13:21.259 --> 13:23.886
<i>Pull back!</i>

13:23.970 --> 13:26.764
<i>Pull back!</i>

13:26.806 --> 13:29.684
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

13:29.767 --> 13:33.729
<i>In the name
of the Soviet Union,</i>

13:33.813 --> 13:36.607
<i>not a step backwards,
or we shoot.</i>

13:36.691 --> 13:39.944
<i>No retreat!
Not a step back!</i>

13:40.027 --> 13:43.030
<i>- No mercy!
- Deserters will be shot.</i>

13:43.114 --> 13:46.784
- Fire!
- Shoot the traitors!

13:46.826 --> 13:49.453
Cowards will be shot!

13:50.580 --> 13:53.875
<i>No mercy for cowards!</i>

14:29.410 --> 14:34.749
<i>Russians, surrender.
You will see your home again.</i>

14:34.832 --> 14:37.502
<i>This is not your war.</i>

14:37.585 --> 14:42.048
<i>Join your German comrades,
they understand your suffering...</i>

14:42.089 --> 14:46.010
<i>and will care more for you
than your own officers,</i>

14:46.052 --> 14:49.347
<i>who are only sending you
to your death.</i>

14:49.430 --> 14:52.934
<i>The Third Reich
is not your enemy.</i>

14:53.017 --> 14:56.604
<i>The enemy is bloodthirsty Stalin
and his Bolshevik camp,</i>

14:56.687 --> 15:00.358
<i>who have stolen your land, who have
deported your father...</i>

15:23.422 --> 15:24.882
Fire!

17:22.708 --> 17:27.171
<i>You'll get us caught,
comrade Commissar.</i>

17:48.734 --> 17:51.445
<i>With your permission,
comrade Commissar.</i>

18:24.061 --> 18:27.523
- Which one should I aim at first?
- You should wait...

18:27.607 --> 18:29.567
till there's an explosion.

18:41.787 --> 18:46.083
- Do you know how to shoot?
- A little.

19:37.593 --> 19:40.096
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
He's looking at us.

20:45.536 --> 20:48.122
Thank you,
comrade Commissar.

20:54.754 --> 20:59.717
Danilov, political officer,
second class.

20:59.800 --> 21:03.721
Twenty-first infantry.

21:21.906 --> 21:25.493
"Vassili Zaitsev".

21:25.576 --> 21:27.870
"On this day,
September the 20th, 1942,

21:27.912 --> 21:31.624
"a shepherd boy from the Urals...

21:34.377 --> 21:38.506
"Arrived in the city of Stalingrad,
on the banks of the Volga.

21:38.589 --> 21:41.425
"His name is Vassili Zaitsev.

21:41.467 --> 21:47.265
"Like thousands before him, he came
to answer comrade Stalin's call.

21:49.225 --> 21:52.854
"Armed with a rifle, he quickly made
the fascist invader realize that...

21:52.937 --> 21:58.067
"from now on he would be punished for
every step he took in the motherland;

21:58.109 --> 22:01.445
that from here on,
the only way was back".

22:04.365 --> 22:06.409
What do you think?

22:08.077 --> 22:11.289
I think comrade Commissar's
been overgenerous.

22:27.972 --> 22:32.435
<i>Let me go!
Let me go!</i>

22:36.647 --> 22:40.985
<i>By order of comrade Stalin,
no civilian can leave the city.</i>

22:43.487 --> 22:46.949
Get back!

22:47.033 --> 22:49.493
<i>Stand away,
or we will open fire.</i>

23:00.755 --> 23:02.590
<i>Stand away!</i>

23:02.673 --> 23:04.634
<i>Get back!</i>

23:05.676 --> 23:07.595
<i>Get back or we shoot!</i>

23:07.678 --> 23:09.347
Back!
Keep back!

23:09.388 --> 23:13.851
<i>Make way for
comrade Stalin's envoy!</i>

23:17.522 --> 23:20.733
I carried out my orders.

23:20.816 --> 23:24.070
I sent in
all of my boys.

23:24.153 --> 23:27.698
But the Germans
engulfed us.

23:27.782 --> 23:31.953
They have artillery,
aircraft, tanks.

23:32.036 --> 23:36.165
- And me, what did I have?
- The sacred duty to resist!

23:36.249 --> 23:38.709
I have to
report to the boss.

23:40.962 --> 23:44.006
Perhaps you'd prefer
to avoid the red tape.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.574
My name is...

24:09.657 --> 24:14.328
Nikita Sergeyevich Kruschev.

24:15.663 --> 24:18.416
I've come to take things
in hand here.

24:18.499 --> 24:22.503
This city is not Kursk...

24:22.587 --> 24:26.424
nor is it Kiev, nor Minsk.

24:26.465 --> 24:30.052
This city is Stalingrad.

24:30.094 --> 24:33.848
Stalingrad!

24:33.931 --> 24:37.101
This city bears the name
of the boss.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.729
It's more than a city,
it's a symbol.

24:39.812 --> 24:45.067
If the Germans
capture this city,

24:45.109 --> 24:49.572
the entire country
will collapse.

24:49.655 --> 24:53.826
Now, I want our boys...

24:53.910 --> 24:56.537
to raise their heads.

24:56.621 --> 25:00.249
I want them to act like
they have balls!

25:00.333 --> 25:04.504
I want them to stop shitting
their pants!

25:07.548 --> 25:11.469
That's your job.

25:11.511 --> 25:16.849
As political officers,
I'm counting on you.

25:19.519 --> 25:23.397
You,
what's your suggestion?

25:23.481 --> 25:25.900
Shoot all the other generals
who have retreated...

25:25.983 --> 25:29.153
<i>and their
chiefs of staff too.</i>

25:29.237 --> 25:32.073
M- Make some examples.

25:32.156 --> 25:36.410
<i>- D-D-Deport families of the deserters...
- Yeah, that's all been done.</i>

25:36.494 --> 25:38.829
<i>Give them hope!</i>

25:50.675 --> 25:54.804
Here, the men's only choice
is between German bullets and ours.

25:54.846 --> 25:57.974
But there's another way.
The way of courage.

25:58.015 --> 26:00.476
The way of love
of the motherland.

26:00.518 --> 26:02.478
We must publish
the army newspaper again.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.647
We must tell magnificent stories.
Stories that extol...

26:04.689 --> 26:06.691
<i>sacrifice, bravery.</i>

26:06.774 --> 26:09.026
<i>We must make them believe
in the victory.</i>

26:09.110 --> 26:13.155
We must give them hope,
pride, a desire to fight.

26:13.197 --> 26:17.326
Yes, we need to
make examples.

26:17.368 --> 26:20.496
But examples to follow.

26:20.580 --> 26:24.458
What we need...
are heroes.

26:28.796 --> 26:30.840
Do you know any heroes
around here?

26:30.923 --> 26:36.387
Yes, comrade,
I know one.

26:41.142 --> 26:43.311
<i>That's me!</i>

26:43.394 --> 26:47.356
"Vassili Zaitsev".
That's me!

26:47.398 --> 26:50.484
No, you're not dreaming.
It's your name.

26:50.568 --> 26:53.321
We made the front page.

26:53.404 --> 26:56.657
They haven't changed a word.

26:56.741 --> 27:00.119
Do you have any idea
what this means?

27:00.203 --> 27:02.747
It's not the back page,
it's not the second page,

27:02.830 --> 27:05.082
- it's the front page.
- The front page!

27:05.166 --> 27:07.585
They're going to reprint
our article everywhere.

27:07.627 --> 27:11.631
In the Caucasus, in the Crimea,
even in the Urals.

27:11.714 --> 27:15.092
Tomorrow morning, Stalin himself
will be sitting over breakfast,

27:15.134 --> 27:18.888
reading my words,
memorizing your name.

27:18.930 --> 27:21.641
<i>We're famous, Vassili.
Kruschev loved the article.</i>

27:21.724 --> 27:23.768
He's promoted me
to the general staff.

27:23.851 --> 27:27.355
And you
to sniper division.

27:29.482 --> 27:31.442
- Well, that's good.
- It's very good.

27:31.526 --> 27:34.737
- It's very good. It's great.
- It's very great!

27:34.779 --> 27:37.031
- It's great!
- For us because we did it together.

27:37.406 --> 27:38.574
Together!

27:38.658 --> 27:40.743
- Although I did all the hard work.
- Oh, yeah?

27:40.785 --> 27:43.120
- You're very lucky I can't fight back.
- Why's that?

27:43.204 --> 27:45.540
Because Kruschev told me to make sure
nothing happens to you.

27:45.623 --> 27:47.583
- You're too important.
- I'm too valuable.

27:47.667 --> 27:50.211
Yes, careful of my... careful
of my glasses, please. They're new.

27:50.294 --> 27:52.255
Sorry, sir.

27:54.549 --> 27:56.884
- I'm famous! We're famous!
- I'm famous! I'm famous!

27:56.968 --> 27:59.512
<i>Vassili,
the young shepherd from the Urals,</i>

27:59.595 --> 28:01.514
<i>killed his 12th
German officer today.</i>

28:01.597 --> 28:03.599
<i>He used to hunt wolves,
now he shoots fascists.</i>

28:03.641 --> 28:06.769
Today, Vassili Zaitsev
shot his 23rd German officer.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.855
<i>He is an example to us all.</i>

28:08.938 --> 28:11.482
<i>Vassili shot
his 32nd German officer.</i>

28:14.277 --> 28:18.197
<i>Count only the Germans
you have killed.</i>

28:18.281 --> 28:20.283
<i>- Today, Vassili Zaitsev...
- Here is the evidence...</i>

28:20.324 --> 28:22.994
<i>11 dog tags retrieved
by sniper Vassili Zaitsev.</i>

28:28.666 --> 28:31.836
<i>More and more men and women, fighters
from all branches of our armed forces,</i>

28:31.878 --> 28:36.340
<i>join the sniper division and learn
the skills of Vassili Zaitsev.</i>

28:40.428 --> 28:42.430
<i>I am a stone.</i>

28:46.058 --> 28:48.561
<i>I am a stone.</i>

28:49.687 --> 28:51.647
<i>I breathe slowly.</i>

28:59.572 --> 29:02.533
<i>I aim at the eye.</i>

29:31.395 --> 29:33.898
<i>So it is you,</i>

29:33.981 --> 29:37.652
the great Vassili Zaitsev.

29:37.735 --> 29:41.197
- My mother makes potatoes with bacon.
- Sounds good.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.783
When she sees you,
she won't believe her eyes.

29:45.701 --> 29:50.081
- How many today?
- Only two.

29:50.164 --> 29:53.000
And the last one,
why didn't you shoot him?

29:53.084 --> 29:57.755
He was only a foot soldier.
Wasn't worth giving away my position.

29:58.156 --> 29:59.745
Bless you.

30:01.167 --> 30:02.462
We know how much
we owe you.

30:04.448 --> 30:06.682
We pray for you every day.

30:07.765 --> 30:12.562
Every evening, we listen to them talk
about you on Radio Moscow.

30:12.603 --> 30:16.315
Thanks. You've certainly
managed well down here.

30:16.399 --> 30:21.028
<i>My parents used to store furniture
down here before the war.</i>

30:21.112 --> 30:23.739
Sacha, drop that right now.

30:23.823 --> 30:26.826
It's loaded.

30:35.293 --> 30:37.211
This way, comrade Commissar.

30:37.295 --> 30:39.255
Thank you, comrade.

30:41.090 --> 30:43.426
Good evening.

30:45.887 --> 30:48.389
Comrade Zaitsev?

30:51.559 --> 30:56.564
My God, where does
all this mail come from?

30:56.647 --> 31:01.694
From all over the country,
Mrs. Filipov, from all over.

31:01.777 --> 31:03.821
This one's from the workers
of the Kouzbass.

31:03.905 --> 31:06.908
<i>They want to name
their mine after Vassili.</i>

31:06.991 --> 31:08.951
Right, let's start
with the miners.

31:10.411 --> 31:12.955
Come on,
let's get to work.

31:17.335 --> 31:19.921
<i>Dear comrades
from the Kouzbass,</i>

31:20.004 --> 31:23.966
- Kouzbass.
- I thank you for your letter of praise.

31:24.050 --> 31:26.886
- Praise?
- R-A-I-S-E.

31:29.555 --> 31:34.769
And... I hope that
I can live up...

31:34.852 --> 31:39.774
to your expectations...
A- T-I-O-N-S.

31:39.857 --> 31:43.569
<i>Expectations.</i>

31:43.653 --> 31:46.447
You're interested
in German literature, Mrs. Filipov?

31:48.783 --> 31:52.537
<i>It's all right,
it's our neighbor.</i>

31:52.620 --> 31:55.164
<i>- Right, where were we?
- Tania, we have guests.</i>

31:55.248 --> 31:58.084
<i>Your offer to name...</i>

32:04.924 --> 32:08.135
<i>I...</i>

32:08.219 --> 32:10.137
I- I recognize you.

32:12.932 --> 32:14.892
He's Vassili Zaitsev.

32:18.396 --> 32:20.940
I saw your picture
in the paper.

32:21.023 --> 32:24.026
<i>Thank you
for everything you're doing.</i>

32:24.110 --> 32:27.822
- And this is his friend, Commissar...
- Danilov.

32:27.905 --> 32:30.032
Danilov.

32:30.074 --> 32:32.201
Tania is like
a daughter to me.

32:32.243 --> 32:35.580
She used to take care of Sacha
when I worked at the factory.

32:35.663 --> 32:37.832
She even taught him German.
All these books are hers.

32:37.915 --> 32:41.544
- Oh, they're yours?
- She studied German at the university.

32:41.586 --> 32:43.921
- Which university?
- Moscow.

32:49.093 --> 32:52.471
Moscow. Moscow.

32:54.599 --> 32:56.726
Shouldn't we, uh...

32:56.809 --> 33:00.104
Yes, let's continue.

33:00.146 --> 33:04.609
<i>Your offer to name
your mine after me...</i>

33:04.650 --> 33:08.321
is... a great honor.

33:10.031 --> 33:14.076
H- O-N.

33:14.118 --> 33:16.120
Yes, I know.
Honor.

33:16.204 --> 33:18.915
Very good.

33:18.956 --> 33:24.420
Shouldn't we make the point that
I'm not the only one fighting?

33:24.462 --> 33:28.466
<i>That... That's excellent...
excellent idea, Vassili.</i>

33:28.549 --> 33:30.593
- We can take it even further though.
- Oh.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.637
We can take it further.

33:32.678 --> 33:36.766
<i>Your battle for
the production of coal...</i>

33:36.807 --> 33:40.436
is as worthy as mine.

33:40.478 --> 33:45.316
There's no "K" in coal.

33:45.399 --> 33:47.401
<i>Just-Just one "L."</i>

33:49.862 --> 33:52.823
<i>Oh, tell me if I'm going too fast.</i>

33:52.907 --> 33:55.660
- No, you're not going too fast.
- You sure?

33:55.743 --> 33:57.828
<i>I just thought is there
any other improvements?</i>

33:57.912 --> 34:02.416
Why don't you get some rest?
These letters can wait until tomorrow.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.919
<i>We should carry on.
We're not tired.</i>

34:05.002 --> 34:08.130
Thank you, Mrs. Filipov.
These people...

34:08.214 --> 34:11.092
took the trouble
to write to us.

34:11.175 --> 34:14.512
Tomorrow, we may not
be around to write back.

35:25.958 --> 35:27.960
Major Konig,
Herr General.

35:48.606 --> 35:52.109
I was expecting
someone...

35:52.193 --> 35:54.111
else.

35:54.195 --> 35:57.073
Certainly not someone
so prestigious.

35:57.114 --> 35:59.116
I imagine you have
your reasons...

35:59.200 --> 36:03.037
for getting yourself involved
in this hellish situation.

36:06.165 --> 36:10.086
<i>My army is not designed
for this kind of fighting.</i>

36:10.127 --> 36:12.380
<i>Yesterday, yet again,
I had to promote...</i>

36:12.463 --> 36:16.926
25 sergeants to replace the officers
shot down by their sharpshooters.

36:18.803 --> 36:22.598
<i>Those snipers are
demoralizing my people.</i>

36:22.640 --> 36:26.978
This city is no more than...

36:27.061 --> 36:29.105
a heap of ruins.

36:31.148 --> 36:34.318
But the fuehrer's persisting.

36:34.402 --> 36:37.613
He has made it a personal matter
between Stalin and himself.

36:43.828 --> 36:47.456
We should trust
the fuehrer's instinct.

36:47.498 --> 36:51.127
He always managed to
lead us to victory.

36:53.004 --> 36:56.841
<i>We shall be back home
for Christmas.</i>

36:59.468 --> 37:03.514
How are you going to go about finding
this young Russian?

37:03.598 --> 37:09.520
I'll fix it so that he's the one
who finds me.

37:10.855 --> 37:13.608
Vassili.
Vassili.

37:13.691 --> 37:16.777
- Come on, time to get up.
- What?

37:16.861 --> 37:20.656
They have a problem in the department
store sector. They need us. Come on.

37:30.249 --> 37:33.920
<i>Look, Vassili, he's hiding
in the department store. Over there.</i>

37:38.925 --> 37:40.885
<i>So far this morning,</i>

37:40.927 --> 37:45.264
he's knocked off five officers,
plus two machine gunners.

37:47.391 --> 37:52.355
<i>Look, third floor,
fourth window from the left.</i>

37:52.396 --> 37:56.150
Fourth window from the left.

37:58.903 --> 38:00.863
<i>See him?</i>

38:00.905 --> 38:03.574
Yeah, I see him.

38:15.127 --> 38:18.047
<i>There, you got him!</i>

38:18.089 --> 38:20.925
<i>Great shot.</i>

38:23.344 --> 38:26.264
Let's go get
his dog tag.

38:30.101 --> 38:32.270
<i>Good-bye, comrade Commissar.</i>

38:32.353 --> 38:35.022
Thank you for your
hospitality, Mrs. Filipov.

38:43.281 --> 38:46.284
You can borrow
whatever you like.

38:46.367 --> 38:49.078
I'm not sure what they would say
to me at headquarters...

38:49.120 --> 38:52.081
if I came back with an armful
of Goethe and Schiller.

38:52.540 --> 38:54.208
There's some Marx too.

38:55.793 --> 38:57.962
You were assigned to civil defense
at the 12th district?

38:58.045 --> 39:00.298
No, I volunteered.

39:00.339 --> 39:03.593
It's such a coincidence
meeting you like this.

39:03.634 --> 39:05.636
Comrade Kruschev was
telling me just yesterday...

39:05.720 --> 39:08.139
how desperately we're in need
of operators who speak German.

39:08.181 --> 39:11.976
I can't. Our militia's responsible
for all the people in this neighborhood.

39:12.059 --> 39:14.061
We're already
desperately short of men.

39:14.145 --> 39:17.106
We'll give you a dozen soldiers
for every one that speaks German.

39:17.190 --> 39:19.150
I'd rather stay and fight.

39:19.192 --> 39:22.320
Serving at headquarters is fighting.
You'd be far more useful there.

39:24.739 --> 39:26.866
<i>You stay here.
You cover us.</i>

39:26.949 --> 39:29.118
<i>- All right.
- We go.</i>

39:31.454 --> 39:33.831
Take care.

39:37.418 --> 39:39.337
Ludmilla, come on.

40:31.430 --> 40:33.432
Check the stairway.

42:22.333 --> 42:24.252
It's a trap.

42:24.335 --> 42:26.629
I know.

42:50.027 --> 42:52.989
Move back.

43:41.287 --> 43:43.247
He's still here.

44:08.022 --> 44:10.608
<i>- They're coming straight for us!
- Ludmilla,</i>

44:10.691 --> 44:14.445
stay where you are,
he's over there somewhere.

44:25.498 --> 44:27.750
We have to
get out of here!

44:30.878 --> 44:34.215
- We have to get out of here!
- Just stay where you are!

44:37.844 --> 44:39.804
What are we gonna do?

44:39.887 --> 44:42.306
Ludmilla, stay where you are!

44:53.234 --> 44:55.945
Fuck this, I'm going.

44:57.822 --> 45:00.950
Ludmilla, no!

45:52.210 --> 45:54.045
What does this mean?

45:56.422 --> 45:59.550
"The little shepherd from the Urals
receives a new sniper's rifle,

45:59.634 --> 46:05.389
"a Mosin-Nagant 7.62,
with its 3.5-Power P.U. Telescope.

46:05.473 --> 46:07.475
Pride of precision
of Soviet production".

46:07.558 --> 46:10.895
- I've seen that rifle close up.
- Have you?

46:10.978 --> 46:15.691
I've even touched it.
I know him well, Vassili Zaitsev.

47:05.116 --> 47:09.787
Ludmilla and Anton were killed today,
and it was my fault.

47:09.871 --> 47:12.290
No, I'm sure
that's not true.

47:12.373 --> 47:17.753
There was a German sniper.
I walked them right into his trap.

47:17.795 --> 47:21.215
<i>- What else can you tell me?
- He didn't relocate.</i>

47:21.299 --> 47:26.137
A sniper who doesn't
relocate isn't normal.

47:27.722 --> 47:33.644
<i>He was very good. It wasn't just
his shooting, it was his instinct.</i>

47:33.728 --> 47:36.397
He was a step ahead
of me all the time.

47:36.480 --> 47:40.610
That's because he knows
everything about you.

47:40.651 --> 47:43.571
His name is Konig,
Major Konig.

47:43.654 --> 47:48.284
They've sent him here
to ki...

47:48.367 --> 47:51.495
to find you.

47:57.877 --> 48:00.630
At first we weren't sure
if the information was reliable.

48:00.713 --> 48:03.758
It seems he's come
all the way from Berlin to stop you.

48:03.841 --> 48:07.261
You've caused them so many sleepless
nights, they sent their top marksman.

48:07.345 --> 48:11.349
- What do we know about him?
- He's a major in the Wehrmacht.

48:11.432 --> 48:15.436
He's director of their
sniper school in Zossen.

48:15.520 --> 48:18.981
Koulikov studied under him
at Zossen before the war.

48:19.065 --> 48:23.444
<i>He knows all his tricks. From now on,
he'll go with you everywhere.</i>

48:23.528 --> 48:26.948
A nobleman from Bavaria
who hunts deer...

48:27.031 --> 48:30.201
against a shepherd boy from the Urals
who poaches wolves.

48:30.284 --> 48:33.204
It's more than a confrontation
between two nations.

48:36.707 --> 48:39.836
It's the essence
of class struggle.

48:39.919 --> 48:42.588
I'm glad
you're so happy.

48:44.632 --> 48:47.844
He had all the advantages.
Next time you'll be even.

48:47.885 --> 48:50.638
No one shoots
like you, Vassili.

48:59.564 --> 49:02.525
She's been transferred.

49:02.608 --> 49:06.112
I'll see if they're ready
for you next door.

49:10.908 --> 49:14.161
- Hello.
- You look smart in your new uniform.

49:15.621 --> 49:18.624
Make sure they don't take it back
once you've finished.

49:18.708 --> 49:21.043
Yeah, they probably will.

49:24.755 --> 49:29.218
<i>I've heard the rumor about the German,
and I wanted to wish you luck.</i>

49:29.260 --> 49:31.846
Thank you.
I'll need it.

49:31.929 --> 49:36.559
From what comrade Danilov
tells me, you're going to win.

49:38.603 --> 49:41.397
Hmm.

49:41.439 --> 49:43.566
It's time.

49:46.277 --> 49:49.238
<i>- Vassili! Vassili!
- Come to my arms.</i>

49:50.615 --> 49:54.535
Look in my direction.

49:54.619 --> 49:56.871
Put your cap back on,
you look more heroic.

49:56.954 --> 49:59.749
<i>- This way, comrade Zaitsev.
- I love this little fellow.</i>

49:59.832 --> 50:03.377
<i>Vassili, is it true that
you volunteered for the front?</i>

50:03.403 --> 50:04.420
<i>How old are you, Vassili?</i>

50:04.462 --> 50:06.464
Do you know what this duel
means for our country?

50:06.547 --> 50:10.468
Is it true you killed your first wolf
when you were five?

50:10.510 --> 50:13.221
<i>Are you proud to be challenged
by the best sharpshooter in Germany?</i>

50:13.304 --> 50:15.264
The Germans are starting
to shit their pants.

50:15.348 --> 50:18.559
<i>Go on, my boy, tell us how
you're going to deal with him.</i>

50:18.643 --> 50:22.063
<i>- Or rather, no. Tell it to the boss.
- One more question, please.</i>

50:22.146 --> 50:25.316
He likes
good hunting stories.

50:30.863 --> 50:34.033
Look at him with pride,

50:34.116 --> 50:36.869
because he's looking at you.

50:36.953 --> 50:40.748
The whole country
is looking at you.

51:02.186 --> 51:06.649
Forgive me, forgive me,
Grandfather.

51:38.598 --> 51:41.684
So, it's not the wolf that
chooses the hunting ground...

51:41.726 --> 51:44.020
but the hunter.

51:47.732 --> 51:50.735
But I'm sure your grandfather
taught you that.

51:54.864 --> 51:57.158
Except in this case,

51:57.241 --> 51:59.160
I'm the game.

52:03.664 --> 52:06.375
<i>However,
today what we're going to do...</i>

52:06.459 --> 52:08.878
<i>is lure the wolf
out of his lair...</i>

52:08.920 --> 52:12.048
<i>to where we want him to be.</i>

52:50.837 --> 52:54.298
You're the one whose life is valuable.
You go first.

52:54.340 --> 52:59.053
No, no. We take it in turns.
Next time is your turn to go first,

52:59.136 --> 53:01.097
<i>and then it's you, Volodya.</i>

53:16.153 --> 53:20.408
Son of a bitch!

53:23.244 --> 53:27.957
These are new pants. I just took them
off a captain from the 251 st yesterday.

53:31.836 --> 53:36.299
Sixteen months I spent
in Germany at the school in Zossen.

53:36.382 --> 53:40.303
<i>Of course, those were the days
when we were friends with the Krauts;</i>

53:40.344 --> 53:43.806
<i>when our Joseph
and their Adolph...</i>

53:43.848 --> 53:46.934
<i>were walking hand in hand.</i>

53:48.686 --> 53:51.606
<i>From here to the wire,
160 meters, right?</i>

53:57.361 --> 53:59.363
One hundred and fifty-five.

53:59.447 --> 54:04.160
<i>Whatever. That'll make 'em
send out a repair guy.</i>

54:04.202 --> 54:07.496
<i>Let's relocate.</i>

54:14.128 --> 54:15.963
Aah!

54:27.183 --> 54:29.352
Hey, Volodya!

54:38.778 --> 54:41.864
After the Germans
invaded us,

54:41.906 --> 54:45.952
it wasn't the same
atmosphere anymore.

54:46.035 --> 54:48.579
Threw my ass
in prison.

54:48.663 --> 54:51.415
What were you doing
in Germany, huh?

54:51.499 --> 54:56.170
Excuse me, says I, but it was
comrade Stalin who sent me there.

54:56.254 --> 55:00.925
Don't bring our glorious leader
into your treachery.

55:01.008 --> 55:04.428
Confess, spy bastard!
Confess.

55:04.512 --> 55:08.516
And bang! Bang, bang, bang!

55:11.853 --> 55:14.564
Well, there wasn't a sickle,
but there was a hammer.

55:14.647 --> 55:19.151
And bang.
Knocked out all my teeth.

55:21.571 --> 55:25.700
<i>That's right, boy.
Have no illusions.</i>

55:25.783 --> 55:29.078
That's the land of socialism
and universal bliss for you.

55:32.456 --> 55:37.086
<i>Hey! It's your repair guy.</i>

55:37.170 --> 55:39.672
I got him.

55:53.477 --> 55:55.438
It's about soup time,
isn't it?

55:55.479 --> 55:58.316
I'm going.

55:58.399 --> 56:01.235
<i>Well, get a move on, Volodya,</i>

56:01.319 --> 56:06.949
<i>and try not to spill it all
on your way back, you Marxist bastard.</i>

56:19.128 --> 56:22.882
The enemy sniper activity reported
during the past 24 hours, Herr Major.

56:25.384 --> 56:29.096
Two sentries shot
in the train station sector.

56:29.180 --> 56:32.099
One artillery observer
in the Northern sector.

56:32.183 --> 56:35.520
One lieutenant from the 24th Panzer
division in the factory sector.

56:35.603 --> 56:39.106
<i>Three telephone repairmen
in the workers'housing sector.</i>

56:39.190 --> 56:43.486
<i>They also tell me we have just taken
a prisoner who may interest you.</i>

56:43.569 --> 56:45.488
I hope he's still
able to speak.

56:45.571 --> 56:48.199
Excuse me, sir?

56:48.282 --> 56:50.785
Nothing.
Thank you.

56:52.954 --> 56:55.831
<i>So, tell us, Volodya,</i>

56:55.915 --> 56:58.042
<i>which building is he in?</i>

57:00.837 --> 57:02.755
There is no way
I know that.

57:05.174 --> 57:07.176
He moves around
all the time.

57:07.260 --> 57:10.179
He jumps from one
to the next.

57:10.263 --> 57:12.181
On which floor?

57:12.265 --> 57:14.183
I don't know.

57:14.267 --> 57:17.395
We'll see about that.

57:17.478 --> 57:19.939
Undress him.

57:20.022 --> 57:22.483
<i>Put him in
one of our uniforms.</i>

57:50.928 --> 57:54.140
You see, they are stubborn.

57:54.223 --> 57:56.392
That's the good thing
about the Germans.

57:56.475 --> 58:00.813
Man, you got to admit
when they get an idea in their heads...

58:16.746 --> 58:18.873
Right.

58:18.956 --> 58:21.375
Let's see if our customer
has arrived.

58:21.459 --> 58:23.961
Are you ready?

58:24.045 --> 58:25.963
Uh-huh.

58:26.047 --> 58:30.259
And now our famous shepherd
from the Urals,

58:30.343 --> 58:32.637
who Major Konig
thinks is an idiot,

58:32.720 --> 58:35.681
gets up to make sure
he has hit his target.

58:35.765 --> 58:38.559
<i>Major Konig sees him.</i>

58:42.063 --> 58:44.857
Aims for his helmet.

58:44.941 --> 58:47.485
Fires.

58:47.568 --> 58:50.863
<i>Reveals his position
and is shot in turn.</i>

59:01.874 --> 59:06.045
Except...
Major Konig doesn't fire...

59:09.590 --> 59:12.426
because Major Konig
isn't there.

59:16.389 --> 59:18.307
Koulikov!

59:24.021 --> 59:27.650
Don't you think that was strange,
that last one?

59:27.733 --> 59:30.862
They sent him out
to get shot like the others.

59:30.945 --> 59:32.864
It's not natural.

59:32.947 --> 59:36.409
Not without artillery,
without trying to cover him.

59:38.494 --> 59:41.664
Oh, no, I'm the one
who was stupid.

59:41.747 --> 59:44.000
They don't give a shit
about telephone guys.

59:44.041 --> 59:46.002
I mean, it's like us
with the Ukrainians.

59:46.043 --> 59:49.547
They'd never bother a major
over a few dead grunts.

59:50.756 --> 59:55.428
Tomorrow, we'll kill us
some generals.

01:00:03.936 --> 01:00:06.647
Whose turn is it?

01:00:06.731 --> 01:00:09.525
Mine, I think.

01:00:09.609 --> 01:00:11.861
Oh, you're such a cheater!

01:00:13.279 --> 01:00:15.364
You can't fool Papa Koulikov.

01:00:15.448 --> 01:00:19.368
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
it's my turn to go first.

01:00:21.454 --> 01:00:24.582
And it's your turn to get a hole
in your britches.

01:01:40.783 --> 01:01:42.702
To victory.

01:01:50.126 --> 01:01:54.839
This sniper business
has been dragging on too long.

01:01:54.922 --> 01:01:57.175
What's that little fellow
of yours up to?

01:02:00.052 --> 01:02:02.513
He's probing,
comrade Kruschev.

01:02:02.597 --> 01:02:05.057
He's testing the Germans
for weaknesses.

01:02:05.141 --> 01:02:07.059
He's meticulous
in his preparation.

01:02:09.478 --> 01:02:14.400
Vodka...
is a luxury we have.

01:02:14.483 --> 01:02:17.862
Caviar is
a luxury we have.

01:02:17.945 --> 01:02:20.823
Time is not.

01:02:20.865 --> 01:02:23.826
He's aware of that
comrade Kruschev. We both are.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.331
I assure you
he will succeed.

01:02:28.414 --> 01:02:30.458
<i>Good.</i>

01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:34.795
It seems your destinies
are entwined.

01:02:56.943 --> 01:02:58.861
They're keeping you busy.

01:03:03.741 --> 01:03:05.826
I picked this up
in the kitchen.

01:03:05.868 --> 01:03:09.622
It's from the reception the other day.
I thought Mrs. Filipov might like it.

01:03:10.373 --> 01:03:13.626
Um, she will be thrilled.
That's very sweet of you.

01:03:14.752 --> 01:03:16.963
There's plenty more
if you're hungry.

01:03:18.381 --> 01:03:20.842
You're Jewish,
aren't you?

01:03:20.883 --> 01:03:25.263
There's nothing in our religion
that says you can't eat sturgeon.

01:03:25.346 --> 01:03:29.851
My father had a premonition
all this would happen.

01:03:29.892 --> 01:03:32.061
You mean the war?

01:03:32.144 --> 01:03:36.148
<i>He understood that the hatred
of the Jews ran deep.</i>

01:03:36.232 --> 01:03:40.444
He was saving up to buy
some land in Palestine.

01:03:40.528 --> 01:03:44.740
He said it was the only land
we truly belonged in;

01:03:44.824 --> 01:03:47.702
the only land
we had a duty to defend.

01:03:47.743 --> 01:03:51.873
<i>He insisted I learn
to use a rifle.</i>

01:03:51.914 --> 01:03:54.208
I learned to shoot.

01:03:58.754 --> 01:04:03.926
I know that in times of war, personal
feelings should be put aside, but...

01:04:03.968 --> 01:04:06.053
I have a favor
to ask you.

01:04:06.095 --> 01:04:08.389
Of course.
Anything you want.

01:04:08.431 --> 01:04:11.601
I want to be reassigned.

01:04:13.728 --> 01:04:16.355
What's happened, Tania?

01:04:41.005 --> 01:04:42.965
<i>He shot him.</i>

01:04:46.802 --> 01:04:49.263
He shot him even though
he jumped first.

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.184
Shot him on the run.

01:04:53.267 --> 01:04:55.520
<i>It was
an impossible shot.</i>

01:04:55.603 --> 01:04:57.897
<i>I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:01.400
You've promised people
a victory I can't deliver.

01:05:03.486 --> 01:05:06.239
I don't stand a chance
against this man.

01:05:06.322 --> 01:05:08.407
You mustn't talk
like that, Vassili.

01:05:10.076 --> 01:05:13.704
<i>What if I told you we found
a way to track his movements?</i>

01:05:13.788 --> 01:05:15.915
We've got someone, Vassili.

01:05:15.998 --> 01:05:19.210
Someone close to him
passing us information.

01:05:19.293 --> 01:05:22.338
Next time you will be
one step ahead of him.

01:05:24.048 --> 01:05:26.008
I promise.

01:05:35.476 --> 01:05:39.063
Now I have a favor to ask.

01:05:39.146 --> 01:05:41.065
From me?

01:05:43.985 --> 01:05:45.903
It's about Tania.

01:05:51.367 --> 01:05:53.327
Come in.

01:05:58.332 --> 01:06:00.376
<i>He doesn't even know you exist.</i>

01:06:00.459 --> 01:06:04.213
<i>But at that moment, you are closer
to him than anyone else on earth.</i>

01:06:04.297 --> 01:06:07.466
You see his face
through the sight.

01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:09.886
You see whether he shaved
that morning or not.

01:06:09.969 --> 01:06:13.723
You can see whether he's married
by whether he has a wedding ring on.

01:06:16.225 --> 01:06:18.352
It's not like...

01:06:18.436 --> 01:06:21.689
just firing at a distant shape,
not just a uniform.

01:06:21.731 --> 01:06:24.817
It's a man's face.

01:06:24.901 --> 01:06:28.613
Those faces don't go away.

01:06:28.696 --> 01:06:33.868
<i>They come back and they just...
they get replaced by more faces.</i>

01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:37.121
Did Danilov ask you
to tell me this?

01:06:37.205 --> 01:06:40.958
He likes you very much. I think he'd try
anything to change your mind.

01:06:41.042 --> 01:06:43.794
Did he tell you
why I asked for the transfer?

01:06:43.878 --> 01:06:45.796
No.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:48.799
<i>This morning, a list
arrived at headquarters.</i>

01:06:48.883 --> 01:06:51.511
It was a list of civilians
who'd been...

01:06:51.594 --> 01:06:54.055
rounded up and sent to Germany
in a convoy...

01:06:54.096 --> 01:06:56.682
that left Stalingrad
three weeks ago.

01:06:58.351 --> 01:07:00.686
My parents
were amongst them.

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:07.109
After 30 kilometers,
the German soldiers...

01:07:07.193 --> 01:07:11.322
stopped the train
and forced everyone out.

01:07:13.115 --> 01:07:17.620
In the middle of a bridge,
they bound them together,

01:07:17.703 --> 01:07:20.623
two by two.

01:07:20.665 --> 01:07:23.292
Mothers with daughters.

01:07:23.376 --> 01:07:25.294
Husbands and wives.

01:07:27.213 --> 01:07:31.467
They... lined them up
against the railing,

01:07:31.509 --> 01:07:34.846
and then they fired
a single shot at each pair...

01:07:34.929 --> 01:07:36.848
to save bullets.

01:07:37.974 --> 01:07:40.685
It worked.

01:07:40.768 --> 01:07:45.356
The bodies of the ones who died
dragged the others under the water.

01:07:48.776 --> 01:07:50.903
I know they died together.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:55.074
They never would have let
themselves be separated.

01:08:10.423 --> 01:08:14.093
That's Koulikov's rifle.
It's a good... rifle.

01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:25.270
Thank you.

01:08:54.466 --> 01:08:57.178
I know how he leaves
the shelter.

01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:59.180
He goes through
the tractor factory.

01:08:59.221 --> 01:09:02.475
The tractor factory is big.

01:09:05.185 --> 01:09:07.854
I know exactly where.
He crawls through a gutter,

01:09:07.939 --> 01:09:10.858
under a grate
where the vats are,

01:09:10.899 --> 01:09:12.944
then he goes out
from the workshop.

01:09:13.027 --> 01:09:16.238
<i>In between the two,
there's a place where he's in the open.</i>

01:09:16.322 --> 01:09:19.200
It's under
a long, iron foot walk.

01:09:53.109 --> 01:09:55.194
Good luck, comrade.

01:11:40.258 --> 01:11:43.010
I know exactly where
he's waiting for me.

01:11:46.138 --> 01:11:48.975
He'll be on the foot walk
over the gutter.

01:11:49.058 --> 01:11:51.519
We'll take him out
from behind.

01:12:11.455 --> 01:12:16.752
We'll get to the other end
of the workshop through these pipes.

01:12:16.794 --> 01:12:18.754
<i>Follow me.</i>

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:07.405
You go that way.
I'll go around this way.

01:14:07.488 --> 01:14:10.283
Okay?

01:14:26.048 --> 01:14:27.967
Shit!

01:14:35.349 --> 01:14:38.769
Sergei,
you should go back.

01:14:38.853 --> 01:14:42.064
<i>- No, I'll be all right.
- Go back.</i>

01:14:42.148 --> 01:14:44.525
No, you go!

01:14:49.071 --> 01:14:51.032
Keep your legs in.

01:15:33.908 --> 01:15:38.746
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:16:37.263 --> 01:16:40.808
Comrade Stalin is asking for
one last effort!

01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:42.894
<i>The fate of the motherland
is at risk!</i>

01:16:42.977 --> 01:16:45.563
<i>The fate of all those
you love and cherish!</i>

01:16:45.646 --> 01:16:48.024
It's for them
that we fight today.

01:16:50.276 --> 01:16:53.863
Listen to me, Tania. The Germans
are throwing everything at us.

01:16:53.946 --> 01:16:56.866
If they're lucky, one in ten
of these soldiers will come back alive.

01:16:56.949 --> 01:16:59.952
You're highly educated.
You know languages.

01:17:00.036 --> 01:17:03.414
Every intercept you translate
saves hundreds of lives.

01:17:03.497 --> 01:17:07.335
Every message you decode
kills thousands of theirs.

01:17:07.376 --> 01:17:09.504
You have a duty to survive.

01:17:09.545 --> 01:17:12.131
Vassili was born to fire a gun.
It's what he knows.

01:17:12.215 --> 01:17:15.885
You and I were born
for a different purpose.

01:17:15.968 --> 01:17:18.804
If Vassili were here,
he would tell you the same thing.

01:17:22.058 --> 01:17:26.562
Where is he?
Where is Vassili?

01:18:32.461 --> 01:18:34.505
<i>Keep your head down.</i>

01:18:34.589 --> 01:18:37.216
<i>- Tell me where he is.
- Stay into that pipe, Tania.</i>

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:39.302
Stay in. Stay in!
Get your head in!

01:18:47.143 --> 01:18:49.312
Slow down.

01:18:49.395 --> 01:18:51.314
Don't shoot.

01:18:56.319 --> 01:18:58.112
He's over there.

01:19:11.584 --> 01:19:14.587
Do you see the pillar
in front of you?

01:19:16.464 --> 01:19:18.925
<i>I need you
to move round behind it.</i>

01:19:28.809 --> 01:19:30.728
Go.

01:19:32.438 --> 01:19:37.818
<i>Tania, I need you to find
a large piece of glass.</i>

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:41.072
Piece of glass.

01:19:42.615 --> 01:19:46.536
<i>Do you see the kiln...</i>

01:19:46.619 --> 01:19:50.331
behind me to the left
of the factory?

01:19:52.625 --> 01:19:54.585
Yes? I can't hear you.

01:19:54.669 --> 01:19:57.797
<i>- Yes.
- Yes.</i>

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.132
Do you see...

01:20:00.216 --> 01:20:03.219
the two louvers?

01:20:04.554 --> 01:20:07.390
<i>- Yes.
- Do you see the one...</i>

01:20:07.473 --> 01:20:10.226
with a broken slat?

01:20:10.309 --> 01:20:12.228
Yes.

01:20:12.353 --> 01:20:14.397
This is what
I want you to do.

01:20:21.404 --> 01:20:24.615
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

01:20:24.699 --> 01:20:28.911
Three... two... one...

01:20:47.096 --> 01:20:49.682
Hello, Sacha.

01:20:55.813 --> 01:20:57.899
He was right
where you said he'd be.

01:20:59.442 --> 01:21:01.360
Nearly there.

01:21:04.614 --> 01:21:06.532
He's very clever.

01:21:11.787 --> 01:21:13.789
Tell me about him.

01:21:20.963 --> 01:21:24.842
Why was it his grandfather taught him
how to shoot and not his father?

01:21:24.926 --> 01:21:28.513
His father's dead.
His mother too.

01:21:31.474 --> 01:21:33.476
Does he talk
about his father?

01:21:33.559 --> 01:21:35.978
No. He didn't know him.

01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:40.274
Did he go to school?

01:21:40.316 --> 01:21:43.945
He knows how to write.
He answers lots of letters.

01:21:43.986 --> 01:21:47.073
Hmm. Is it girls
who write to him?

01:21:47.156 --> 01:21:49.951
Everyone writes to him.

01:21:49.992 --> 01:21:52.036
Is there a girl
he loves in his village?

01:21:52.119 --> 01:21:55.998
- Not in his village, here.
- Does she love him?

01:21:56.082 --> 01:21:59.001
Yes, because he's handsome.

01:21:59.085 --> 01:22:02.129
Because he's brave
and she's very beautiful.

01:22:02.213 --> 01:22:04.590
I know her well.
She's from my neighborhood.

01:22:04.674 --> 01:22:07.635
<i>She went to the university.
They're handsome together.</i>

01:22:07.718 --> 01:22:09.804
<i>Later, the two of them
will get married.</i>

01:22:15.852 --> 01:22:17.812
At least, I think so.

01:22:19.981 --> 01:22:22.984
And you, Sacha,

01:22:23.025 --> 01:22:24.986
why are you helping
the Germans?

01:22:29.031 --> 01:22:32.410
Because they're stronger.
Because they're going to win the war.

01:22:32.493 --> 01:22:35.746
And because you like
chocolate, huh?

01:22:52.388 --> 01:22:55.349
<i>All these people here
know they're gonna die.</i>

01:22:55.391 --> 01:22:58.728
So each night
when they make it back,

01:22:58.811 --> 01:23:01.522
it's a bonus.

01:23:01.564 --> 01:23:04.192
Excuse me.

01:23:04.233 --> 01:23:06.694
So, every cup of tea,

01:23:06.736 --> 01:23:08.988
every cigarette...

01:23:09.071 --> 01:23:12.575
<i>becomes a little celebration.</i>

01:23:12.658 --> 01:23:15.119
<i>Because for a lot of us,
it may be our last night.</i>

01:23:16.704 --> 01:23:20.499
It's just something
you have to accept here.

01:23:20.583 --> 01:23:22.502
Everyone has their time.

01:23:26.839 --> 01:23:31.552
<i>In the forest,
the wolf lives for three years,</i>

01:23:31.594 --> 01:23:33.554
the donkey for nine.

01:23:36.724 --> 01:23:40.269
So, that's-that's got to be
a proverb from the Urals.

01:23:40.353 --> 01:23:42.313
It makes no sense to me
whatsoever.

01:23:42.396 --> 01:23:46.275
The donkey lives longer
because he's more useful.

01:23:46.359 --> 01:23:48.277
Makes absolute sense.

01:23:48.361 --> 01:23:50.446
There aren't any donkeys
in the forest.

01:23:50.530 --> 01:23:53.449
You made it up.

01:23:53.533 --> 01:23:57.411
So... I'm a donkey?

01:24:01.082 --> 01:24:04.377
People like you
and Danilov...

01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:06.379
have to survive this.

01:24:06.462 --> 01:24:09.799
People who have read books,
had an education.

01:24:11.342 --> 01:24:13.803
We'll need you
when the war is over.

01:24:13.886 --> 01:24:16.597
<i>And if you survive?</i>

01:24:16.639 --> 01:24:20.393
<i>What will the useless
Vassili Zaitsev do then?</i>

01:24:20.476 --> 01:24:23.688
<i>I wanna work in a factory.</i>

01:24:23.771 --> 01:24:28.317
My granddad took me
to a factory once.

01:24:28.401 --> 01:24:33.364
<i>There was this man there,
high up on a...</i>

01:24:33.447 --> 01:24:35.825
on a foot walk.

01:24:35.908 --> 01:24:39.078
He wasn't wearing blue
like the others.

01:24:39.161 --> 01:24:43.374
The people he was supervising
didn't understand what they were doing.

01:24:43.457 --> 01:24:45.710
But for him,
for him up there,

01:24:45.793 --> 01:24:48.462
it was simple;
it was clear.

01:24:48.504 --> 01:24:53.718
And I thought, "One day,
I could be that man".

01:24:59.348 --> 01:25:03.144
Sad to have a dream
you know won't happen.

01:25:04.854 --> 01:25:06.814
Why shouldn't it?

01:25:09.108 --> 01:25:11.027
You'll outlive us all.

01:25:11.110 --> 01:25:13.154
Hmm.

01:25:13.237 --> 01:25:16.199
You'll be the oldest donkey
in the forest.

01:25:33.174 --> 01:25:36.052
<i>"150 meters stand between
the Germans and the Volga.</i>

01:25:36.093 --> 01:25:38.513
<i>"Today the whole world
is watching these 150 meters.</i>

01:25:38.554 --> 01:25:41.641
They are what makes
Stalingrad..."

01:25:41.724 --> 01:25:43.643
the capitol...

01:25:43.726 --> 01:25:45.937
of the war.

01:25:50.566 --> 01:25:52.527
Your friend, Tania...

01:25:53.903 --> 01:25:55.863
have you see her?

01:25:55.905 --> 01:25:58.699
She stays over there now,
with the snipers.

01:26:01.077 --> 01:26:03.871
Tell the major we're sending in
all of our sharpshooters...

01:26:03.913 --> 01:26:06.582
to support the attack
on the factory.

01:26:07.875 --> 01:26:10.336
Tell him Vassili
will be there.

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:04.070
- I need to talk to you.
- Sure.

01:30:08.241 --> 01:30:10.618
- Danilov.
- Hmm?

01:30:23.297 --> 01:30:25.883
You have to
stop writing about me.

01:30:29.262 --> 01:30:31.848
I'm not gonna get him
because I'm not good enough.

01:30:31.931 --> 01:30:35.852
Sooner or later, he's gonna find me,
he's gonna kill me.

01:30:35.893 --> 01:30:38.187
I've warned you before
not to talk like this.

01:30:40.273 --> 01:30:43.568
This time it's different.

01:30:45.194 --> 01:30:47.488
You've built me up...

01:30:47.572 --> 01:30:51.075
and up into someone I'm not.

01:30:52.493 --> 01:30:55.705
I can't carry that weight anymore.
I wanna fight.

01:30:56.873 --> 01:31:00.668
I want to fight just
as a regular soldier.

01:31:01.794 --> 01:31:03.713
I understand.

01:31:03.796 --> 01:31:07.508
The thing is, you're not a regular
soldier. You're extraordinary.

01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:11.179
No, I'm what
you've made me.

01:31:11.262 --> 01:31:13.806
Nothing more.

01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:20.730
Why are you
telling me this now?

01:31:20.813 --> 01:31:23.149
Hmm? What's happened?

01:31:26.694 --> 01:31:28.613
What's changed?

01:31:33.576 --> 01:31:35.661
<i>Did you speak
to Tania for me?</i>

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:39.999
- Yes.
- Well...

01:31:40.082 --> 01:31:42.460
will she reconsider?

01:31:46.130 --> 01:31:48.341
I don't know.

01:31:50.843 --> 01:31:54.722
She should. She'll be much safer.
She should, you know that.

01:31:54.764 --> 01:31:58.392
<i>- Yeah.
- It'll be easier to get her reassigned.</i>

01:31:58.434 --> 01:32:01.646
<i>The Germans are preparing
another offensive in the city center.</i>

01:32:01.729 --> 01:32:04.982
<i>The propaganda battle is crucial
for morale. We need you more than ever.</i>

01:32:05.066 --> 01:32:07.026
Sacha. Hold on. Sacha!

01:32:11.697 --> 01:32:14.617
- Tell him what you know, Sacha.
- Hello, Sacha.

01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:16.827
There was dust
on the major's boots.

01:32:16.911 --> 01:32:21.332
Sacha has the major convinced
he's gone over to the other side.

01:32:21.415 --> 01:32:24.377
<i>I don't need to tell you
the risks he's taking.</i>

01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:27.839
<i>The dust was yellow. There's only
one place where there's dust like that...</i>

01:32:27.922 --> 01:32:31.175
in the back of the chemical factory,
a big heap on the tracks.

01:32:33.135 --> 01:32:35.096
Well done.

01:32:35.137 --> 01:32:37.974
Sacha...

01:32:38.057 --> 01:32:40.476
wait for me outside then.

01:32:47.441 --> 01:32:49.110
- Danilov,
- Hmm?

01:32:49.151 --> 01:32:53.072
You had no right
to use him.

01:32:53.155 --> 01:32:56.284
No, no, I didn't use him,
Vassili.

01:32:56.367 --> 01:32:59.453
He did it of his own accord.

01:32:59.537 --> 01:33:02.039
You know why?

01:33:02.123 --> 01:33:04.208
Because he believes in you!

01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:14.969
Tomorrow morning, we're going
to take back the chemical factory.

01:33:15.052 --> 01:33:18.306
Sacha's informed the major
you'll be there,

01:33:18.347 --> 01:33:21.058
so now you know where
you have to wait for him.

01:33:21.142 --> 01:33:24.312
- In the middle of an assault.
- I'm following orders.

01:33:24.395 --> 01:33:26.564
I suggest you do the same.

01:33:28.316 --> 01:33:31.360
Now, I'm aware
of the risks.

01:33:31.444 --> 01:33:33.362
You'll be fine.

01:33:37.950 --> 01:33:39.869
Comrade.

01:34:06.354 --> 01:34:08.272
That's the Germans
up there.

01:34:08.356 --> 01:34:10.316
And yesterday
was the Russians.

01:34:10.399 --> 01:34:12.485
We're not very far now.

01:34:14.529 --> 01:34:17.240
Sacha...

01:34:17.323 --> 01:34:19.617
you're playing
a very dangerous game.

01:34:21.202 --> 01:34:23.287
I want you to win.

01:34:24.413 --> 01:34:27.708
See there?
Keep going along the river.

01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:30.378
It's safe... for a while.

01:39:09.115 --> 01:39:13.244
<i>He's dead.
We found this on his corpse.</i>

01:39:16.038 --> 01:39:19.792
<i>Your reason for being here
has ceased to exist.</i>

01:39:19.876 --> 01:39:22.003
Pardon me, Herr General,

01:39:22.044 --> 01:39:24.881
but I do not believe...

01:39:24.964 --> 01:39:27.258
<i>There is a plane bound for Berlin
tomorrow evening.</i>

01:39:27.341 --> 01:39:29.635
<i>You will be on it.</i>

01:39:32.555 --> 01:39:35.975
Until then, I must ask you
for your dog tags.

01:39:38.227 --> 01:39:41.355
Imagine how Russian propaganda
would profit from your death.

01:39:41.397 --> 01:39:43.816
If you fall,
you will fall unknown.

01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:46.235
You've already had
a near miss.

01:39:55.369 --> 01:39:58.372
Also please take
this War Merit Cross.

01:39:58.456 --> 01:39:59.957
It was awarded posthumously...

01:40:00.041 --> 01:40:02.376
to a lieutenant of the
116th Infantry Division...

01:40:02.418 --> 01:40:04.587
who fell here during the first days
of the battle.

01:40:07.173 --> 01:40:09.091
He was my son.

01:40:11.761 --> 01:40:14.680
<i>If the landing is captured,
everything's lost!</i>

01:40:17.183 --> 01:40:19.101
Come here.

01:40:22.396 --> 01:40:24.315
What did I tell you?

01:40:24.398 --> 01:40:27.026
You've been playing
your fiddle too much!

01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:29.862
If it's confirmed
that he's dead, we're sunk!

01:40:29.946 --> 01:40:33.658
<i>- Well, you're sunk.
- It isn't true.</i>

01:40:33.741 --> 01:40:36.577
It was intercepted
from their staff headquarters.

01:40:36.619 --> 01:40:39.497
What do they have to do,
dangle his body in front our our men?

01:40:39.580 --> 01:40:42.542
They're lying.

01:40:42.625 --> 01:40:46.754
That's good.
Very good.

01:40:46.838 --> 01:40:50.633
Write it, then.
"Vassili Zaitsev is not dead.

01:40:50.716 --> 01:40:53.135
"This is what he had
for breakfast this morning.

01:40:53.219 --> 01:40:57.640
This is a picture of him reading
today's newspaper". You're the poet.

01:40:58.224 --> 01:40:59.642
<i>What?</i>

01:40:59.725 --> 01:41:02.270
<i>You won't give up
the riverbank!</i>

01:41:02.353 --> 01:41:05.356
<i>I don't care if you've lost
half your men!</i>

01:41:05.439 --> 01:41:08.526
Lose the other half,
or lose yourself!

01:41:14.490 --> 01:41:16.868
Is he back?

01:41:18.995 --> 01:41:20.955
He should be back soon.

01:41:23.291 --> 01:41:25.668
The German attack cut the lines.
That's why he's late.

01:41:28.337 --> 01:41:30.298
Can we go outside?

01:41:36.679 --> 01:41:39.182
I wrote to my mother
about you.

01:41:39.265 --> 01:41:41.684
<i>She wanted me to tell you
that once this war was over,</i>

01:41:41.767 --> 01:41:44.145
if there's anything you needed...
anything at all...

01:41:44.187 --> 01:41:46.480
our family
will be there for you.

01:41:48.941 --> 01:41:51.027
You know I'm here for you.

01:41:55.448 --> 01:41:58.242
They're saying
Vassili is dead.

01:41:58.326 --> 01:42:02.663
Vassili Zaitsev
will never see his loved ones again.

01:42:02.705 --> 01:42:06.334
<i>Surrender!
This is your only hope.</i>

01:42:10.129 --> 01:42:12.757
You're upset.

01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:15.092
Because Zaitsev is dead?

01:42:18.054 --> 01:42:20.848
You don't have to hide it.
There's no shame in it.

01:42:21.891 --> 01:42:24.268
You're a Russian
like he is.

01:42:27.104 --> 01:42:29.273
<i>Don't listen to them.</i>

01:42:29.357 --> 01:42:32.610
It's just propaganda.

01:42:32.693 --> 01:42:34.737
He isn't dead.

01:42:35.905 --> 01:42:37.823
And do you know why?

01:42:39.075 --> 01:42:41.244
Because I haven't
killed him yet.

01:42:48.251 --> 01:42:50.211
I'm going to tell you
a little secret.

01:42:52.088 --> 01:42:55.132
Only you, because
I know I can trust you.

01:42:55.216 --> 01:42:58.386
But you must swear to me that
you won't tell another soul.

01:43:00.888 --> 01:43:03.850
You swear?

01:43:03.933 --> 01:43:06.978
I found a terrific spot.

01:43:07.061 --> 01:43:09.814
It's by the exit
from the train station.

01:43:09.897 --> 01:43:12.733
I'll hide
in the water tower.

01:43:12.775 --> 01:43:15.778
<i>Tomorrow.
I'll wait for him there.</i>

01:43:15.862 --> 01:43:19.866
You'll see.
He'll be there.

01:43:20.992 --> 01:43:25.162
He always is.

01:43:32.295 --> 01:43:36.132
I also want you to swear that from now
on, you'll stay home where you belong.

01:43:38.467 --> 01:43:42.138
Do you swear?
Yes?

01:43:45.224 --> 01:43:48.144
Good.

01:43:48.227 --> 01:43:50.229
"We know he's alive.
We know he won't fail us.

01:43:50.313 --> 01:43:53.608
We know because he is a part of us now.
Vassili is eternal".

01:43:56.652 --> 01:44:00.114
Where have you been?
We've looked everywhere for you.

01:44:00.156 --> 01:44:03.826
<i>Oh, didn't you hear?
I was dead.</i>

01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:07.914
<i>At least the noble sniper
Zaitsev...</i>

01:44:10.041 --> 01:44:12.835
Vassili was dead.

01:44:12.919 --> 01:44:14.837
The real one.

01:44:17.256 --> 01:44:20.051
Me...

01:44:20.134 --> 01:44:22.053
I was asleep,

01:44:22.136 --> 01:44:24.055
<i>and I missed my chance.</i>

01:44:24.138 --> 01:44:29.477
<i>Then, I was curled up
in a corner, hiding...</i>

01:44:29.519 --> 01:44:32.021
from a man
who wants to kill me.

01:44:32.104 --> 01:44:34.899
I'll talk to Kruschev.

01:44:34.982 --> 01:44:38.027
He'll send you back
to your old division.

01:44:38.110 --> 01:44:41.447
- Where's Tania?
- She's at the shelter.

01:44:41.531 --> 01:44:43.783
I've been to the shelter.

01:44:43.866 --> 01:44:45.993
<i>I told her you weren't dead.</i>

01:44:47.745 --> 01:44:51.290
The major said so.
He said the other Germans were lying.

01:44:51.374 --> 01:44:54.460
He told me you were waiting
for him at the station.

01:44:58.381 --> 01:45:00.299
Vassili.

01:45:20.736 --> 01:45:22.697
Vassili.

01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:26.158
Vassili.

01:45:32.915 --> 01:45:35.251
My little Sacha.

01:45:35.334 --> 01:45:37.253
I knew it.

01:45:55.271 --> 01:45:57.982
<i>- Vassili.
- Tania.</i>

01:46:04.780 --> 01:46:07.074
I knew you weren't dead.

01:46:07.116 --> 01:46:09.577
How?

01:46:09.619 --> 01:46:12.413
Because we only just met.

01:46:16.083 --> 01:46:21.339
I prayed for the first time
since I was a little girl.

01:46:21.422 --> 01:46:24.717
When I opened my eyes,
Sacha was standing there...

01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:26.969
waiting to give me
the good news.

01:46:29.972 --> 01:46:32.934
I think he loves you
even more than I do.

01:46:57.333 --> 01:47:00.002
<i>To the proper military authority,</i>

01:47:00.086 --> 01:47:02.630
I'm calling to the commandant's
attention the recent changes noticed...

01:47:02.713 --> 01:47:06.801
in the attitude towards fighting
of soldier Vassili Zaitsev.

01:47:06.843 --> 01:47:10.972
<i>He has attempted on several occasions
to escape his duties,</i>

01:47:11.013 --> 01:47:13.432
voiced doubts on the chances
of our victory...

01:47:13.516 --> 01:47:15.434
and made defeatist comments
in public.

01:47:17.019 --> 01:47:19.647
<i>The inexplicable
duration of his duel...</i>

01:47:19.689 --> 01:47:24.610
with the Nazi sharpshooter
can only be explained by...

01:47:24.694 --> 01:47:27.488
his lack of belief
in the communist ideal.

01:47:35.413 --> 01:47:37.331
Good morning, Sacha.

01:47:39.333 --> 01:47:43.212
Once again, he knew
exactly where to find me.

01:47:43.296 --> 01:47:46.757
Don't you think
that's strange?

01:47:46.841 --> 01:47:50.636
Apart from me, only you knew.

01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:53.472
I don't hold it against you,
Sacha.

01:47:53.556 --> 01:47:56.893
You've done
a very brave thing.

01:47:56.976 --> 01:47:59.937
You've chosen your camp.
I respect that.

01:48:00.021 --> 01:48:01.939
But it isn't my camp.

01:48:02.023 --> 01:48:04.901
We're both soldiers,

01:48:04.984 --> 01:48:09.697
and we're both enemies,
so I know you understand.

01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:15.369
I'm annoyed with you, little Sacha, for
not staying home as I made you swear to.

01:48:15.453 --> 01:48:18.831
I'm annoyed with you for obliging me
to do what I'm going to have to do.

01:48:24.378 --> 01:48:28.299
I've never seen anyone
frown so much in their sleep.

01:48:31.385 --> 01:48:33.846
How long have you been
watching me?

01:48:33.930 --> 01:48:36.349
All night.

01:48:36.432 --> 01:48:39.393
You've been snoring away
happily for hours.

01:48:39.435 --> 01:48:42.396
I don't snore.
Do I?

01:48:42.438 --> 01:48:44.398
Like a pig.

01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:46.984
I suppose I talk
in my sleep as well.

01:48:47.068 --> 01:48:48.986
Yes.

01:48:51.197 --> 01:48:53.241
There's something
I should tell you.

01:49:00.831 --> 01:49:03.668
On the train...

01:49:03.751 --> 01:49:05.670
coming here...

01:49:07.547 --> 01:49:09.632
we were in the same car.

01:49:09.715 --> 01:49:11.634
No.

01:49:11.717 --> 01:49:13.928
I saw you.

01:49:13.970 --> 01:49:17.431
You were reading,
and you fell asleep.

01:49:19.934 --> 01:49:23.479
I didn't dare look at you,
you were so beautiful.

01:49:25.231 --> 01:49:27.149
It was scary.

01:49:29.986 --> 01:49:34.115
Afterwards, I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

01:49:34.156 --> 01:49:36.117
It made me smile.

01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:41.998
And then I thought of all the men
who would get to hold you...

01:49:44.333 --> 01:49:46.377
who'd make you laugh...

01:49:48.921 --> 01:49:50.840
how lucky they were.

01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:57.171
And now I'm the one
lying next to you.

01:50:00.057 --> 01:50:03.019
- Was I snoring?
- Like a pig.

01:50:35.176 --> 01:50:37.136
What?

01:50:40.806 --> 01:50:44.018
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, no.

01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:46.020
- Oh, my God!
- Tania, no.

01:50:46.062 --> 01:50:48.064
- Tania, no!
- No, get off me!

01:50:48.147 --> 01:50:50.816
- Get off me! Get off me!
- It's what he wants!

01:50:50.858 --> 01:50:52.818
- This is what he wants!
- Get off me!

01:50:52.860 --> 01:50:56.197
- No, he'll kill you. He'll kill you!
- Let me go!

01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:59.408
- I'll run after you, and he'll kill me.
- Let me go!

01:50:59.534 --> 01:51:02.328
- Let me go!
- This is what he wants! I'll get him.

01:51:02.370 --> 01:51:05.248
I promise I'll get him.

01:51:05.331 --> 01:51:08.376
I'll get his rifle for you.
I promise, Tania.

01:51:27.603 --> 01:51:30.940
I need you.

01:51:34.151 --> 01:51:37.196
You have to leave now, Mrs. Filipov.
Stalingrad may fall.

01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:40.032
The last of the boats are leaving.
The Germans will be here any moment.

01:51:40.074 --> 01:51:43.452
He's brought you a pass.
You'll be safe on the other side.

01:51:43.536 --> 01:51:46.289
Gather your things, and we'll help you
carry them to the landing stage.

01:51:46.372 --> 01:51:49.959
I'm not leaving.
This is my home.

01:51:50.042 --> 01:51:53.045
This is my Sacha's home.
I can't leave.

01:51:53.087 --> 01:51:55.423
<i>I have to tell you something,
Mrs. Filipov.</i>

01:51:58.009 --> 01:52:01.012
Something very difficult
to understand.

01:52:01.095 --> 01:52:03.014
It's about Sacha.

01:52:17.445 --> 01:52:20.198
He's gone over to the Germans.
He's betrayed his country.

01:52:20.281 --> 01:52:22.658
He's with the enemy now.
He won't be coming back.

01:52:25.536 --> 01:52:27.455
Oh, my God.

01:52:30.458 --> 01:52:32.376
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:52:35.296 --> 01:52:38.508
He's become a traitor.

01:52:38.591 --> 01:52:41.469
<i>The poor little thing.</i>

01:52:41.511 --> 01:52:44.388
<i>What has he done?</i>

01:52:47.141 --> 01:52:49.143
So, he's going to
stay over there?

01:52:54.690 --> 01:52:59.529
Yes... he's going to
stay over there.

01:52:59.612 --> 01:53:03.324
<i>I shouldn't be saying this,
comrade Commissar,</i>

01:53:03.366 --> 01:53:06.244
but maybe
it's for the best.

01:53:06.327 --> 01:53:08.663
If the Germans have won,
he'll be safe.

01:53:08.746 --> 01:53:12.667
<i>I know it's wrong, but perhaps
he has made the right choice.</i>

01:53:31.936 --> 01:53:34.814
<i>- Oh! Oh, Tania!
- Tania?</i>

01:53:35.982 --> 01:53:38.734
<i>- Oh, Tania!
- Tania!</i>

01:53:39.819 --> 01:53:42.780
<i>Oh, my God! Oh!</i>

01:53:59.046 --> 01:54:03.718
I need a doctor!
A doctor!

01:54:07.513 --> 01:54:10.308
I have a pass.
I have a pass!

01:54:10.391 --> 01:54:12.310
You must let her cross.

01:54:15.021 --> 01:54:16.939
Please!

01:54:17.023 --> 01:54:21.068
- It's useless. She'll never make it.
- No! No, she will!

01:54:21.152 --> 01:54:24.238
She's my daughter!
She's my daughter!

01:54:24.322 --> 01:54:26.741
- I beg of you!
- All right.

01:54:26.824 --> 01:54:29.660
- Oh, thank you!
- Put this one on the boat.

01:55:16.499 --> 01:55:19.168
Where is he?

01:55:19.252 --> 01:55:21.754
<i>Where's the major?</i>

01:55:21.838 --> 01:55:24.048
A few inches
from your face.

01:55:26.843 --> 01:55:29.846
<i>I've been such a fool,
Vassili.</i>

01:55:29.929 --> 01:55:34.141
Man will always be man.

01:55:34.225 --> 01:55:36.310
There is no new man.

01:55:37.645 --> 01:55:40.982
We tried so hard to create
a society that was equal,

01:55:41.065 --> 01:55:43.818
<i>where there'd be nothing
to envy your neighbor.</i>

01:55:43.901 --> 01:55:47.280
But there's always
something to envy.

01:55:48.906 --> 01:55:50.992
A smile...

01:55:51.075 --> 01:55:52.994
a friendship.

01:55:54.495 --> 01:55:58.541
<i>Something you don't have
and want to appropriate.</i>

01:55:58.624 --> 01:56:02.211
<i>In this world...
even a Soviet one...</i>

01:56:02.295 --> 01:56:05.464
there will always
be rich and poor.

01:56:07.216 --> 01:56:09.302
Rich in gifts...

01:56:10.803 --> 01:56:12.722
poor in gifts.

01:56:13.806 --> 01:56:15.725
Rich in love...

01:56:16.934 --> 01:56:18.853
poor in love.

01:56:25.193 --> 01:56:28.237
Tania isn't coming back.

01:56:28.821 --> 01:56:31.782
<i>She's dead, Vassili.</i>

01:56:39.957 --> 01:56:44.212
<i>She was cut down by shrapnel.
It was quick.</i>

01:56:44.295 --> 01:56:46.297
<i>I don't think
she even saw it coming.</i>

01:56:48.049 --> 01:56:50.092
She was on her way
back to you.

01:56:50.176 --> 01:56:55.264
As soon as she had seen Mrs. Filipov to
the boats, she was coming back for you.

01:56:55.348 --> 01:57:00.186
<i>She was right.
You're a good man, Vassili.</i>

01:57:04.315 --> 01:57:06.859
<i>I want to help you,
Vassili.</i>

01:57:06.943 --> 01:57:09.612
<i>Let me do one last thing.</i>

01:57:09.695 --> 01:57:12.198
Something useful
for a change.

01:57:17.745 --> 01:57:19.747
Let me show you
where the major is.

01:57:19.789 --> 01:57:22.250
Don't do that.
Don't do that!

02:01:36.921 --> 02:01:42.134
<i>Today, February 3, 1943,
is an ominous day for Hitler...</i>

02:01:42.176 --> 02:01:46.639
<i>and the endless columns of hundreds
of thousands of German prisoners.</i>

02:01:46.764 --> 02:01:50.601
It is an unforgettable day
of hope for our motherland.

02:02:03.489 --> 02:02:07.493
<i>After 180 days of heroic combat...</i>

02:02:07.577 --> 02:02:09.662
<i>in the market city
of Stalingrad,</i>

02:02:09.704 --> 02:02:14.959
<i>and as a result of the valor
and self-sacrifice of our soldiers,</i>

02:02:15.042 --> 02:02:18.171
<i>the commander
of our glorious Red Army...</i>

02:02:18.212 --> 02:02:21.382
<i>received
the unconditional surrender...</i>

02:02:21.465 --> 02:02:25.178
<i>of the German fascist invaders.</i>

02:02:37.356 --> 02:02:41.569
Sorry. No, young man,
I cannot find...

02:02:41.652 --> 02:02:43.571
- a matching name in the book.
- Could you check again?

02:02:43.654 --> 02:02:46.490
<i>- This is the address and her name.
- She is not here.</i>

02:02:46.574 --> 02:02:51.162
Yes, this is our address,
but we don't have her anymore.

02:02:51.245 --> 02:02:53.998
<i>- This is the address. She's been here.
- I'm so sorry.</i>

02:02:54.081 --> 02:02:56.792
<i>- She wrote to me.
- I looked three times. She's not here.</i>

02:02:56.876 --> 02:03:02.340
<i>Believe me, there is no Tania Chernova.
I can't help you.</i>

02:03:02.423 --> 02:03:04.342
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>
