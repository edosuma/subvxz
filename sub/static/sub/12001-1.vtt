00:17.182 --> 00:18.116
Yours?

00:18.216 --> 00:20.402
This is it! We're here!

00:20.502 --> 00:23.721
- On this very...
- Come on.

00:26.024 --> 00:28.727
And this is our bachelorette.
Say hi, Casey.

00:28.827 --> 00:30.028
Can you turn that thing off?

00:30.128 --> 00:33.732
And get your last week of being
single undocumented, not a chance!

00:33.832 --> 00:35.601
Seriously, turn it off.

00:35.701 --> 00:39.548
Yeah, I understand, but I asked
for three beds, and there's only two.

00:40.673 --> 00:42.951
Okay, thanks.

00:43.308 --> 00:44.676
I need a drink.

00:45.778 --> 00:47.880
Let's get this vacation started.

00:47.980 --> 00:50.749
- I'm gonna have a piÃ±a colada.
- That sounds fun.

00:50.849 --> 00:52.918
You're a bachelorette,
you can do whatever you want.

00:53.018 --> 00:55.921
May I... may I have a piÃ±a colada, please?

00:56.021 --> 00:58.958
- Oh, don't be nervous, we're harmless.
- Don't turn away.

00:59.058 --> 01:03.962
- This is so relaxing.
- Here is to your freakin' bachelorette!

01:04.062 --> 01:05.096
- To me!
- Woo!

01:05.197 --> 01:06.732
Yeah!

01:06.832 --> 01:09.101
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:09.201 --> 01:11.203
Oh, it's so good.
Maybe I should've bought one.

01:11.303 --> 01:13.705
I think we need some shots.

01:13.805 --> 01:16.241
We're here to have fun.

01:16.341 --> 01:17.910
We will.

01:18.010 --> 01:18.844
- Jill?
- Yeah?

01:18.944 --> 01:20.846
Are you having one?

01:20.946 --> 01:23.729
Delicious.

01:24.816 --> 01:27.385
I'd like to make a toast.

01:27.485 --> 01:31.123
Casey! Get out here, please.

01:31.223 --> 01:36.295
Whatever happens tonight, know that
we love you and we care for you.

01:36.395 --> 01:39.243
- And I'm so proud of...
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:39.343 --> 01:43.569
- What is it?
- There's a bug in the toilet!

01:43.669 --> 01:47.327
- What does it look like?
- I don't know! It's a bug!

01:56.415 --> 01:59.585
I mean, seriously, his mother hates me.

01:59.685 --> 02:02.087
She thinks I'm ruining his life.

02:02.187 --> 02:05.624
Well, of course she does. I mean,
you're taking away her baby boy.

02:05.724 --> 02:08.894
Ugh, we live in the same building.

02:08.994 --> 02:12.865
She's making sure that you're not
defiling him before marriage.

02:12.965 --> 02:16.635
You know, it is weird that she's
making him make you wait.

02:16.735 --> 02:20.679
I mean, how old-school is she?
Who waits for marriage anymore?

02:21.139 --> 02:26.106
Lots of rum! ...alcohol in here?

03:13.692 --> 03:17.863
I just don't know. I mean, like,
how do I know that this is it?

03:17.963 --> 03:20.666
How do I know that Jared
is actually the one?

03:20.766 --> 03:23.535
Honey, you are so totally fine, okay?

03:23.635 --> 03:26.038
I mean, Jared loves you and he's smart.

03:26.138 --> 03:30.175
- And... and he's so...
- He's good looking.

03:30.275 --> 03:34.012
- He's good looking!
- And he's an investment banker.

03:34.112 --> 03:38.339
- He's an investment banker.
- He's probably great in bed.

03:41.687 --> 03:44.211
Guys, let's just go.

03:44.790 --> 03:46.058
Honey...

03:56.885 --> 04:00.124
I'm getting married! Woo!

04:00.226 --> 04:02.964
- Anything?
- Anything.

04:03.575 --> 04:06.745
Guys! Guys! Guys!
You've gotta come hear this! Come!

04:06.845 --> 04:11.684
- Hey, where have you been?
- It's amazing. Come! Hurry up!

04:11.884 --> 04:15.220
It's called the Buddha Strand
Sea of Stars.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.790
It's the most beautiful place on earth.

04:17.890 --> 04:21.660
The water is so clear,
that once you step in it,

04:21.760 --> 04:25.452
- it's like you're standing on the sky.
- Wow.

04:25.552 --> 04:28.189
So, how do we get there?

04:29.167 --> 04:33.038
You can't.
It's not really a tourist thing.

04:33.138 --> 04:38.199
Oh, come on. There must be
something we can do, right?

04:39.845 --> 04:42.536
Okay, we enter here.

04:43.015 --> 04:45.217
Are we seriously doing this?

04:45.317 --> 04:48.587
We're doing this! Get your ass in there!

04:50.889 --> 04:53.448
Are we almost there?

04:54.726 --> 04:58.030
I don't know. Is that the hill?

04:58.130 --> 05:02.100
- I don't know.
- This doesn't look like anything on the map.

05:02.200 --> 05:05.860
Ugh! Guys, I'm getting
eaten alive out here.

05:16.815 --> 05:18.750
- We're here!
- We're here! Woo!

05:18.850 --> 05:21.954
- We're getting in that water.
- I can't believe we actually found it.

05:22.054 --> 05:24.760
- Let's just go investigate a little?
- Come on, Jill!

05:24.860 --> 05:27.008
- Don't fall.
- Oh, it's so nice!

05:27.108 --> 05:29.027
I thought it was supposed
to be white sand.

05:29.127 --> 05:31.897
Oh, my God. It's so nice!

05:31.997 --> 05:34.265
- The water's so beautiful!
- Kirsten!

05:37.735 --> 05:39.738
- Ugh.
- Stick your head under.

05:39.838 --> 05:43.275
- How's the water?
- Why don't you come in and find out?

05:43.375 --> 05:45.232
Yeah!

05:45.644 --> 05:47.179
You know you gotta tell him, right?

05:47.279 --> 05:50.348
- What?
- Jared, he's got the right to know.

05:50.448 --> 05:51.917
- Jill!
- What?

05:52.017 --> 05:55.787
Not the time or the place.
It's none of our business.

05:55.887 --> 05:59.413
I will! I will tell him.

05:59.825 --> 06:02.160
- He wants kids more than anything.
- I know.

06:02.260 --> 06:04.396
And you don't.

06:04.496 --> 06:06.598
I know.

06:06.698 --> 06:08.834
I'll tell him.

06:08.934 --> 06:10.302
- Ow!
- What?

06:10.402 --> 06:13.360
I just felt something in the water.

06:13.839 --> 06:16.742
Oh, my God! I think something bite me!

06:16.842 --> 06:20.111
- Yeah, I know, I'm covered.
- No, I mean, under water, Jill.

06:20.211 --> 06:24.216
Oh, it's because you're so tasty,
baby. Tasty!

06:24.816 --> 06:28.153
- Oh, I just felt something there.
- What?

06:28.253 --> 06:30.524
- Jill? Jill!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.393
- Jill!
- Jill? What happened?

06:32.493 --> 06:37.014
- I think there's something in the water!
- Casey! Casey! Get out! Get out!

06:37.963 --> 06:41.422
- Jill! Jill?
- Jill?

06:43.936 --> 06:47.406
- You shit head! Jill!
- I'm sorry, I had to!

06:47.606 --> 06:50.569
- I'm coming over!
- You bitch!

06:51.009 --> 06:53.812
- Are you alright?
- No, something bit me.

06:53.912 --> 06:56.514
Aww, are you okay?

06:56.614 --> 06:59.651
Yeah. It's just a little bite.

07:30.047 --> 07:33.685
- Hello, beautiful.
- Hi. You're home.

07:33.785 --> 07:35.120
- Yeah.
- Why aren't you at work?

07:35.220 --> 07:38.345
Well, I wanted to see you. I missed you.

07:40.558 --> 07:43.895
I missed you too, so much.

07:43.995 --> 07:47.065
You better have. How was it?

07:47.165 --> 07:49.935
It was fun. It was a lot.

07:50.035 --> 07:52.593
I don't even know where to begin.

07:54.105 --> 07:55.963
What?

07:56.908 --> 07:59.461
- I have a surprise.
- What?

07:59.561 --> 08:02.880
- Keep your eyes closed. Okay?
- Okay.

08:02.980 --> 08:07.007
Alright, that's it. Just move forward.

08:07.719 --> 08:10.822
- Okay, no peeking.
- You're really bad at this.

08:10.922 --> 08:13.792
Shh. I'm trying to have a moment here.

08:13.892 --> 08:17.929
If you're taking me to the bedroom,
I need to shower first.

08:18.029 --> 08:20.387
Getting warmer.

08:22.767 --> 08:26.327
And stop. You ready?

08:32.477 --> 08:33.611
I...

08:33.712 --> 08:36.514
I dug it out of my mom's
storage last month.

08:36.614 --> 08:39.583
And I found a guy in the village,
that restores antiques.

08:39.683 --> 08:42.054
It was my father's before it was mine.

08:42.154 --> 08:46.046
I mean, for whenever we're ready.

08:47.158 --> 08:50.651
It's... it's beautiful, babe.

08:54.266 --> 08:56.568
That didn't take long.

08:56.668 --> 08:58.737
I can call him later.

08:58.837 --> 09:00.739
It's okay.

09:00.839 --> 09:03.742
So? Do you love it?

09:03.842 --> 09:05.733
I...

09:07.579 --> 09:12.451
- Ah, damn. I'm sorry, baby. It's Chuck.
- Tell him I say hi.

09:12.551 --> 09:15.687
I wanna hear all about
your trip tonight, okay?

09:15.787 --> 09:18.679
I promise, okay?

09:22.060 --> 09:24.985
Hey, Chuck. How you doing?

11:04.846 --> 11:06.670
Ow.

11:16.841 --> 11:20.011
<i>Hey, Mrs. Kennedy. Where's the mister?</i>

11:20.111 --> 11:23.748
- Working. Where else?
- You serious? You just got back.

11:23.848 --> 11:27.119
Yeah, well, he's not the one on vacation.

11:27.219 --> 11:29.287
Seriously, sweetie,
you need to sit Jared down,

11:29.387 --> 11:31.789
tell him this workaholic act
needs to stop.

11:31.889 --> 11:36.316
Yeah. There are a lot of things
we need to talk about.

11:36.661 --> 11:38.429
The ring...

11:38.529 --> 11:40.933
The ring, and just...

11:41.033 --> 11:45.603
Honey, you're not still getting cold feet,
are you? We talked about this.

11:45.703 --> 11:48.695
No, I just...

11:48.795 --> 11:52.260
<i>Okay, it better not be about
that creep on the trip.</i>

11:52.360 --> 11:54.529
- Kirsten!
- I'm sorry. I'm just asking.

11:54.629 --> 12:00.073
- I mean, hell, I feel guilty about it.
- No, it's just...

12:01.253 --> 12:03.910
It's about a lot of things.

12:50.435 --> 12:54.094
- You're back.
- Hi, Mrs. Kennedy.

12:54.372 --> 12:56.574
The bugs seemed to like you.

12:56.674 --> 12:59.313
Oh... yeah.

12:59.413 --> 13:04.471
I actually think the insects over there,
prefer the taste of bug-spray.

13:07.619 --> 13:12.623
So, I was just doing laundry,
and I ran out of detergent before I left.

13:12.723 --> 13:14.692
Do you have some?

13:14.792 --> 13:19.119
A woman doesn't run out of detergent.

13:21.966 --> 13:26.304
Dmitri called.
You haven't decided on the wedding band.

13:26.404 --> 13:28.339
Yeah, I know. I just got back today.

13:28.439 --> 13:31.009
But I have it on my list
to call him tomorrow.

13:31.109 --> 13:34.812
And the caterer? And the florist?

13:34.912 --> 13:37.081
You have a deposit due for the dress.

13:37.181 --> 13:42.587
And Myrna won't finish
the alterations, until you pay it.

13:42.687 --> 13:45.891
- I know.
- You know?

13:46.291 --> 13:51.029
And still you left on some trip,
with your friends.

13:51.629 --> 13:56.601
Well, I'm back now. Who would've known
weddings would be this hard, right?

13:56.701 --> 13:58.836
Marriage is hard.

13:58.936 --> 14:02.006
Kids are hard.

14:02.106 --> 14:04.976
You know nothing of either.

14:05.076 --> 14:07.678
If you can't handle something so silly,

14:07.778 --> 14:11.805
so simple, as a wedding...

14:12.684 --> 14:15.409
then I pray for my son.

14:17.638 --> 14:20.464
Don't forget your detergent.

14:29.634 --> 14:34.041
- <i>This is it. We're here!</i>
- <i>You look beautiful. It's fine!</i>

14:34.706 --> 14:36.674
<i>Look at this rock!</i>

14:36.774 --> 14:39.075
<i>This is a rock!</i>

15:06.604 --> 15:10.942
Hi, Cyrano! How's my favorite puppy?

15:11.042 --> 15:14.412
I missed you so much. Yes, I did!

15:14.512 --> 15:18.149
- We were hoping you'd stop by today.
- Hi, Mr. Matheson.

15:18.249 --> 15:21.875
Poor boy. He's been
moping about for over a week.

15:22.053 --> 15:26.490
I don't think I've seen him
this sad since Silvia passed.

15:27.158 --> 15:29.016
So, how was your trip?

15:29.560 --> 15:32.797
Exhausting. It's good to be back.
That's for sure.

15:32.897 --> 15:35.834
- Vacations can do that.
- Do what?

15:35.934 --> 15:39.003
Well, make you miss the little things.

15:39.103 --> 15:43.040
- It's good to have you back, Casey.
- Thanks, Mr. Matheson. It's good to be back.

15:43.140 --> 15:46.644
Well, you two go have fun.
And thanks for walking him.

15:46.744 --> 15:52.049
Thanks. We will.
Come on, boy. Come on. Come on.

15:52.149 --> 15:54.442
Come on, Cyrano.

16:39.297 --> 16:41.999
I have to postpone the wedding.

16:42.099 --> 16:44.385
I just...

16:44.485 --> 16:46.337
I can't do it.

16:46.437 --> 16:49.963
- <i>I know. I know it's really hard.</i>
- I can't do it.

16:50.875 --> 16:54.045
- I'm not ready.
- <i>I know, honey.</i>

16:54.145 --> 16:59.316
<i>That's why you need to talk to him,
tonight. Tell him how you feel.</i>

16:59.416 --> 17:02.019
<i>You owe it to him and yourself.</i>

17:02.119 --> 17:05.926
<i>If you wait any longer, it will be
too close to the wedding to turn back.</i>

17:06.027 --> 17:08.114
<i>And how...</i>

17:36.087 --> 17:40.575
Mom, please. Enough already.
I don't want to hear it anymore.

17:40.675 --> 17:42.960
Well, you're going to.

17:43.060 --> 17:47.521
Mom, Casey and I are getting married.
You need to start accepting it.

17:48.265 --> 17:52.003
You're my son. The only good thing
I have in this wretched world,

17:52.103 --> 17:56.441
and I will not just watch you
make the same mistakes I did.

17:56.541 --> 17:59.385
For the last time, Mom, my fiancÃ© is not,

17:59.485 --> 18:02.152
nor has she ever, cheated on me.

18:02.847 --> 18:05.872
That's what I said about your father.

18:07.151 --> 18:09.709
She's not good for you.

18:10.488 --> 18:12.557
I've gotta go.

18:12.657 --> 18:14.948
I'll see you later.

18:53.097 --> 18:57.034
- You're late.
- I know. I'm sorry, babe. Work was...

18:57.134 --> 18:58.959
Yeah.

19:02.173 --> 19:04.364
Are you mad?

19:05.843 --> 19:09.836
No. Come on, dinner's getting cold.

19:13.117 --> 19:16.487
So Chuck looks at this guy and he says,
"What are you fucking kidding me?

19:16.587 --> 19:18.923
"Homeless Henry,
on 9th dresses better than you do."

19:19.023 --> 19:22.059
Then, babe, I swear to God,
Chuck looks this guy right in the eyes,

19:22.159 --> 19:24.462
and he says,
"Get the fuck out of my office,

19:24.562 --> 19:27.932
"and don't come back
until you buy a decent suit."

19:32.570 --> 19:34.872
Casey, you okay?

19:34.972 --> 19:37.889
Yeah, I just...

19:42.461 --> 19:46.607
I just must have caught
a bug or something.

19:49.854 --> 19:53.304
Hey, where's your ring?

19:54.492 --> 19:57.428
Oh, I wanted to clean it after the trip.

19:57.528 --> 20:00.153
It's just soaking in the bathroom.

20:00.701 --> 20:03.300
Oh, you know you've got to watch out,
what you put your ring in.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.959
It's white gold, so...

20:06.304 --> 20:09.898
Jared, we need to talk.

20:13.877 --> 20:15.768
Okay.

20:17.281 --> 20:21.074
I've been thinking a lot about the wedding.

20:22.153 --> 20:24.413
- And about a lot of other things.
- I know.

20:24.513 --> 20:27.559
My mom was telling me,
you're a little bit behind on the planning.

20:27.659 --> 20:29.994
She said she's totally willing to help.

20:30.094 --> 20:32.452
It's not that.

20:35.099 --> 20:36.901
I just...

20:39.637 --> 20:42.640
- Babe, are you sure you're alright?
- Yeah.

20:42.740 --> 20:44.599
I just...

21:05.629 --> 21:10.657
- Casey, you alright?
- I'm fine! I'll be out in a minute.

21:25.583 --> 21:27.285
That didn't sound good.

21:27.385 --> 21:31.411
Must be the food from the trip.
You know me.

21:32.456 --> 21:35.126
Well, I guess we're done with dinner.

21:35.226 --> 21:37.050
Sorry.

21:40.898 --> 21:42.933
Come on, let's get you to bed,
get you some rest.

21:43.033 --> 21:44.924
Okay.

21:50.007 --> 21:51.898
Touchdown.

21:54.645 --> 21:56.480
How you feeling now?

21:56.580 --> 21:58.471
Better.

21:59.817 --> 22:02.075
I'd like you to stay.

22:06.090 --> 22:09.594
You know, when I got a place here,
to help my mom with the building,

22:09.694 --> 22:13.631
I thought I was only gonna be here
for a couple months.

22:13.731 --> 22:16.634
I couldn't wait to get back
to the upper east side.

22:16.734 --> 22:19.436
And then I met you.

22:19.836 --> 22:21.901
And I didn't want to leave.

22:23.841 --> 22:26.610
Your mother won't know
if you stay the night.

22:26.710 --> 22:29.030
Have you met my mother? She'll know.

22:29.280 --> 22:33.050
- She hates me.
- What? That's not true.

22:33.150 --> 22:36.754
She does. You won't even
sleep here because of her.

22:36.854 --> 22:40.446
She's just a little old fashioned,
that's all.

22:41.292 --> 22:44.084
Hey, listen to me.

22:45.562 --> 22:47.632
I love you.

22:47.732 --> 22:51.068
And next week,
you and I will be husband and wife.

22:51.468 --> 22:54.900
And after that,
we'll leave this place, and we'll...

22:55.000 --> 22:57.274
start our lives together.

22:57.374 --> 23:01.810
She'll come around, you'll see. Okay?

23:04.415 --> 23:06.272
Okay.

23:19.446 --> 23:21.832
- Casey.
- Come on.

23:21.932 --> 23:26.309
- Casey, we should wait.
- Shut up.

23:27.320 --> 23:29.573
- Casey.
- Shut up.

23:29.673 --> 23:32.366
- Casey.
- Shut up.

25:01.698 --> 25:03.167
Casey?

25:03.267 --> 25:06.437
I'm fine! Everything's fine!

25:06.537 --> 25:08.239
What the hell was that?

25:08.339 --> 25:12.276
I'm fine! It's just a small
bug bite from the trip.

25:12.376 --> 25:14.800
Well, it looks infected.

25:14.978 --> 25:17.782
Yeah, I have some cream for it.

25:17.882 --> 25:21.474
Just gonna take a bath first, wash it out.

25:21.918 --> 25:24.577
Really? So we're done here?

25:25.021 --> 25:27.291
You have an early morning.

25:27.391 --> 25:30.583
You should go before your mom notices.

25:36.567 --> 25:38.736
Well, are you at least gonna say goodbye?

25:38.836 --> 25:40.927
Good night.

25:46.710 --> 25:49.271
Well, have a good night.

27:23.173 --> 27:25.209
Where have you been?

27:25.309 --> 27:27.600
Flake much?

27:30.647 --> 27:33.084
Sorry. Rough night.

27:33.184 --> 27:37.588
You too?
It is like the worst diarrhea ever.

27:37.688 --> 27:41.024
I told Kirsten we shouldn't
have drank the water.

27:41.124 --> 27:43.160
I know, right?

27:43.260 --> 27:47.297
Well, look at you, miss Molly Homemaker.

27:47.397 --> 27:51.657
He must've known something was up,
if you cooked for him.

27:51.969 --> 27:53.756
So?

27:54.700 --> 27:57.118
What did you say?

27:57.924 --> 27:59.750
I didn't tell him.

28:01.511 --> 28:05.516
You didn't tell him?
Jesus, Casey, the wedding is in a week.

28:05.616 --> 28:10.420
I know. I know. I just couldn't tell him.
Last night, I couldn't tell him.

28:10.520 --> 28:16.593
It's okay. It's okay
Honey, you know I love you, right?

28:16.693 --> 28:19.217
- And I love Jared too.
- Yeah.

28:19.317 --> 28:24.618
He's a great guy. He's established,
he's mature, he's good looking.

28:24.718 --> 28:27.009
And he's ready.

28:27.404 --> 28:30.441
But, honey, you're not ready.

28:30.741 --> 28:33.861
If nothing else, our trip proved that.

28:35.779 --> 28:37.784
Did he notice your ring is gone?

28:40.184 --> 28:43.630
And you lied to him about it, I assume.

28:46.957 --> 28:49.326
Oh, honey, it's okay.

28:49.426 --> 28:54.348
Oh, it's alright.
You're gonna be fine. You'll see.

28:55.632 --> 28:56.983
What?

28:58.068 --> 29:01.738
One of my bites,
I think it's infected. It hurts.

29:01.838 --> 29:03.907
Look, ever since
we came back from this trip...

29:04.007 --> 29:07.733
Oh, tell me about it. Look, I'm covered.

29:08.812 --> 29:13.283
But I went to the dermatologist yesterday,
and he gave me this cream.

29:13.383 --> 29:15.653
- You need to use it. It helps.
- Yeah.

29:15.753 --> 29:19.192
But I have to get to work, honey, okay?
I'll talk to you later?

29:19.292 --> 29:21.746
Yeah, yeah.

29:37.941 --> 29:41.845
Kirsten? Kirsten? Get up. It's Casey.

29:41.945 --> 29:45.305
- Is she okay?
- I found her. I don't know. Let's go.

29:46.583 --> 29:49.965
Casey? Casey, what happened?

29:50.065 --> 29:54.358
Casey? Casey! Casey, wait.

29:55.058 --> 29:56.882
Casey!

29:58.328 --> 30:00.732
Oh, my God, Casey?

30:00.832 --> 30:03.566
Did someone have a good time last night?

30:04.401 --> 30:06.269
I don't know what happened.

30:06.369 --> 30:09.206
I woke up naked on the beach.

30:09.306 --> 30:13.477
Everything was gone. My clothes, my purse.

30:13.577 --> 30:15.946
The ring, my ring is gone.

30:16.046 --> 30:21.652
- Where the hell did you go?
- I don't know! I can't fucking remember.

30:25.722 --> 30:28.225
Jill, are you filming this?

30:28.325 --> 30:31.261
What the fuck is wrong with you?

30:31.361 --> 30:33.486
Turn it off.

31:19.042 --> 31:21.311
- Morning, Casey.
- Hi, Mr. Matheson.

31:21.411 --> 31:24.448
Dear, you're as pale as a ghost.

31:24.548 --> 31:29.002
Yeah, I must have caught
a bug down south. I'll be fine.

31:29.102 --> 31:33.646
You have to watch it down there.
They have all sort of weird critters.

31:34.105 --> 31:38.729
Cyrano? Hey. Come on, let's go for a walk.

31:38.829 --> 31:42.733
Hmm. Cyrano? That's very strange.

31:43.033 --> 31:47.270
Cyrano, come. Come on, boy.
Come see Casey.

31:47.370 --> 31:51.030
Come on, you lazy dog. Come.

31:51.408 --> 31:53.844
Cyrano, come here.

31:53.944 --> 31:55.804
Cyrano!

31:56.914 --> 31:59.783
I don't know what's gotten into him.
I'm sorry, Casey.

31:59.883 --> 32:02.586
Maybe he's not feeling well either.

32:02.686 --> 32:05.789
Maybe he just wants to stay in today.
We can try it again tomorrow.

32:05.889 --> 32:08.392
Yeah. Okay.

32:08.492 --> 32:12.022
- I'll come by in the morning.
- We'd look forward to that.

32:22.238 --> 32:23.573
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey.

32:23.673 --> 32:27.433
- <i>Hey, what's up?</i>
- What are you doing?

32:28.545 --> 32:32.237
Are you sure about this? About postponing?

32:34.885 --> 32:37.253
When are you gonna tell him?

32:37.353 --> 32:39.444
I don't know.

32:39.756 --> 32:41.657
Tonight maybe.

32:41.757 --> 32:44.361
You know,
why don't you just sleep on this?

32:44.461 --> 32:47.786
It just seems a little impulsive.

32:50.100 --> 32:54.504
Hey... have you been sick at all,
since our trip?

32:54.604 --> 32:57.574
Yeah, I've been tired as a motherfuck.

32:57.674 --> 33:01.144
I'm telling you,
I am never traveling again.

33:01.244 --> 33:05.749
Why? Are you okay?
You know, you don't look so good.

33:05.849 --> 33:09.386
Yeah. I don't know.

33:09.486 --> 33:13.679
I can't eat anything.
I can't keep food down.

33:15.625 --> 33:19.730
- Maybe you're pregnant.
- What? Don't even say that.

33:19.830 --> 33:23.255
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

33:23.767 --> 33:27.337
I'm not pregnant. I'm not.

33:27.837 --> 33:31.897
I can't be. It's not possible.

35:53.984 --> 35:55.852
<i>Hi, Barker's After Hours Clinic.</i>

35:55.952 --> 35:58.789
Hi, I was in Costa Rica last week,

35:58.889 --> 36:02.192
and I got bit by something in the water.

36:02.292 --> 36:04.661
<i>Okay, what did it look like?</i>

36:04.761 --> 36:08.153
I don't know. I didn't see it.

36:08.798 --> 36:11.201
<i>Are you looking at the bite mark now?</i>

36:11.301 --> 36:14.037
- Yes.
- <i>And what color is it?</i>

36:14.337 --> 36:18.007
- Red.
- <i>Does it look infected?</i>

36:18.107 --> 36:21.178
Yeah, and it hurts.

36:21.278 --> 36:25.381
And there's this weird white liquid,

36:25.481 --> 36:28.218
that just keeps coming out.

36:28.318 --> 36:31.922
<i>Okay, that's just pus.
Have you put any antiseptic on it?</i>

36:32.022 --> 36:35.225
- No.
- <i>That's the first thing you should do.</i>

36:35.325 --> 36:39.295
<i>Any over the counter corticosteroid,
should kill the infection.</i>

36:39.395 --> 36:40.664
Okay.

36:40.764 --> 36:44.835
<i>As for the vomiting, it may be caused
by the infection, or maybe not.</i>

36:44.935 --> 36:48.660
<i>You should probably see
your physician to know for sure.</i>

36:49.873 --> 36:52.297
There's one more thing.

36:56.412 --> 36:58.671
I'm pregnant.

37:58.875 --> 38:01.478
- Hello?
- <i>Office of Doctor Martin Langstaff.</i>

38:01.578 --> 38:04.791
<i>We're currently closed.
Please leave us a message.</i>

38:04.891 --> 38:08.818
Hello, this is... this is Casey Morgan.

38:08.918 --> 38:11.969
I'm not feeling well, and...

38:12.622 --> 38:17.149
I need to speak to a doctor
as soon as possible.

38:17.960 --> 38:21.854
Please call me back. It's Casey Morgan.

39:39.075 --> 39:41.693
Surprise!

39:41.845 --> 39:46.416
Babies! Babies! Babies! Babies!

40:02.933 --> 40:07.713
Babies! Babies! Babies! Babies!

40:08.139 --> 40:11.541
No! No! No! No, please! Stop!

40:11.641 --> 40:15.044
Stop! Stop! Stop! Please, stop!

40:15.144 --> 40:17.947
You're killing them! No! Don't! Stop!

40:18.047 --> 40:21.341
Stop! Please, stop!

40:21.441 --> 40:24.621
Stop, please! Stop! Stop!

40:24.721 --> 40:27.657
Please! Stop!

40:28.207 --> 40:32.846
Stop, please stop! Stop! Please, no!

42:20.736 --> 42:24.140
No. No, no, no, no, no.

42:49.212 --> 42:51.092
Casey?

43:22.515 --> 43:24.311
Casey!

43:26.636 --> 43:29.506
I know you're in there! Answer the door!

44:06.943 --> 44:10.046
I know you're in there! Answer the door!

44:17.320 --> 44:20.845
Casey! Open up!

45:05.034 --> 45:07.592
What are you doing here?

45:09.639 --> 45:11.641
What is wrong with you?

45:11.741 --> 45:14.343
You shouldn't be here.

45:14.443 --> 45:18.948
No, this is exactly where I should be.

45:19.048 --> 45:22.330
I've had complaints about the smell.

45:23.185 --> 45:25.510
What is this?

45:28.991 --> 45:31.260
I know what you are.

45:31.360 --> 45:35.531
You harlot! I asked you for one thing.

45:35.631 --> 45:39.869
Do not soil my son, out of wedlock.

45:39.969 --> 45:42.461
You couldn't even do that.

45:43.239 --> 45:46.008
You're filthy. Look at this place!

45:46.108 --> 45:48.211
You're disgusting!

45:48.311 --> 45:52.081
I know that is not my son's child in you.

45:52.548 --> 45:56.274
So tell me the truth. Whose child is it?

45:56.686 --> 45:59.444
Please leave.

46:01.757 --> 46:04.426
When I tell him tonight,

46:04.526 --> 46:07.530
the wedding will be canceled.

46:07.630 --> 46:09.899
And you and your bastard

46:09.999 --> 46:13.191
won't get a penny from us.

46:14.103 --> 46:18.027
Whose child is it?

46:21.377 --> 46:24.880
Leave now.

46:24.980 --> 46:27.215
Answer me.

46:29.752 --> 46:31.762
Answer me!

49:37.172 --> 49:40.242
<i>Hey, it's Casey. Leave a message.</i>

49:40.342 --> 49:43.101
Hey, it's me again.

49:43.579 --> 49:45.680
What's going on, Case?

49:45.780 --> 49:50.152
I live 50 feet away and I haven't seen
or heard from you in days.

49:50.252 --> 49:53.022
Come on, fill me in here.

49:53.122 --> 49:56.425
Give me a call. Something, please.

49:56.525 --> 49:58.550
Anything.

50:16.612 --> 50:18.636
Casey, open up.

50:22.685 --> 50:25.844
- Casey, I'm coming in.
- Jared!

50:29.458 --> 50:32.862
- Casey, open the door and let me in.
- I can't do it.

50:32.962 --> 50:35.765
What do you mean?
Just open the door. Let me in.

50:35.865 --> 50:38.534
No. The wedding!

50:39.234 --> 50:41.926
I can't do it!

50:43.172 --> 50:45.274
What do you mean you can't do the wedding?

50:45.374 --> 50:47.576
I'm not ready.

50:47.676 --> 50:50.001
I can't do it!

50:51.213 --> 50:54.183
Just open up. We need to talk about this.

50:54.283 --> 50:56.819
I love you, Jared!

50:58.353 --> 51:01.424
I just need some time...

51:02.658 --> 51:04.760
...to figure things out.

51:04.860 --> 51:07.319
Casey, open the door.

51:09.331 --> 51:11.767
Casey, open the door.

51:13.302 --> 51:17.118
- Open up!
- Jared, leave!

52:09.658 --> 52:11.461
Jill?

52:12.261 --> 52:14.807
Jill, open the door.

52:19.535 --> 52:22.605
- Oh, hey, what's up?
- Why are you avoiding me?

52:22.705 --> 52:27.676
What? I'm not, I've just been busy.
Why? What's the emergency?

52:27.776 --> 52:30.279
In case you haven't noticed,
Casey's been M.I.A. for a week.

52:30.379 --> 52:32.648
She's not answering
any of my calls or texts.

52:32.748 --> 52:36.552
Yeah, I know. I got her voicemail too.
I just wanted to give her space.

52:36.652 --> 52:40.498
This whole decision with Jared,
she must be taking it pretty hard.

52:40.598 --> 52:42.742
Well, yeah, you think?

52:42.842 --> 52:45.895
We went on this trip together,
and we said we'd watch out for each other.

52:45.995 --> 52:49.999
And look what happened.
This is our fault. All of us.

52:50.099 --> 52:53.235
Give me a break, Kirsten, okay?
She made her own decisions down there.

52:53.335 --> 52:56.071
No one forced her to cheat on Jared.

52:56.171 --> 52:59.875
I don't remember signing up
to be her babysitter.

52:59.975 --> 53:03.045
Wow. Jill, nice.

53:03.145 --> 53:06.060
You know what? Whatever. Regardless
of what you think happened down there,

53:06.160 --> 53:07.950
we need to figure out
what's going on with her.

53:08.050 --> 53:12.187
She's probably just lying in her bed crying,
and eating a huge tub of ice cream,

53:12.287 --> 53:15.024
watching a shitty Dabrowski movie.

53:15.124 --> 53:17.326
She'll be fine.

53:17.426 --> 53:19.895
Honestly, I don't know.

53:20.195 --> 53:22.164
Something feels off.

53:22.264 --> 53:25.653
I really don't think
she's just ignoring us.

53:27.102 --> 53:29.438
I stopped by her apartment yesterday.

53:29.538 --> 53:32.130
And she didn't answer but...

53:32.892 --> 53:35.044
But what?

53:35.144 --> 53:38.180
I smelled something coming from inside.

53:38.280 --> 53:40.438
Something really bad.

53:41.950 --> 53:44.042
I'm just...

53:44.353 --> 53:47.049
I'm just worried that she...

53:47.471 --> 53:51.627
Come on, Kirsten! She would never do that.

53:51.727 --> 53:56.431
- She's way too much of a pussy.
- Jill, what the hell is wrong with you?

53:56.531 --> 54:00.068
You know, just because you're cool with being
a whore, doesn't mean everybody is.

54:00.168 --> 54:02.026
Wow.

54:02.938 --> 54:04.774
Okay.

54:05.274 --> 54:08.643
Well, it was great seeing you.
Thanks for stopping by.

56:56.845 --> 56:58.670
Casey?

57:01.516 --> 57:03.374
Casey!

57:04.236 --> 57:08.029
Come on, Casey. Open up.
Seriously, you're scaring me.

57:38.687 --> 57:40.545
Casey?

57:55.704 --> 57:58.129
Casey, seriously!

58:09.384 --> 58:11.876
Casey, you're scaring me.

58:54.679 --> 58:57.138
Don't go in there.

58:59.268 --> 59:01.003
Casey?

59:01.103 --> 59:04.339
Oh, my God, Casey you scared the shit
out of me. Where have you been?

59:04.439 --> 59:07.242
And what is all this?

59:07.342 --> 59:09.533
What happened in here?

59:09.644 --> 59:11.475
I'm...

59:12.614 --> 59:13.707
...sick.

59:13.807 --> 59:17.606
Casey, talk to me here.
Why have you been ignoring me?

59:19.721 --> 59:22.724
Kirsten, I'm so scared.

59:22.824 --> 59:25.392
Oh, my God. Casey,
I was so worried about you.

59:27.529 --> 59:30.766
You should have called me.
Hey, come on. Let's get you out of here.

59:30.866 --> 59:34.005
- I can't!
- Yes, you can. Come on.

59:34.105 --> 59:37.222
No, I can't leave now.

59:43.612 --> 59:46.771
Casey, your face...

59:48.483 --> 59:50.954
Kirsten, don't be scared.

59:51.954 --> 59:55.648
Kirsten, don't be scared.
Kirsten, don't be scared.

59:55.908 --> 59:59.494
Kirsten! Kirsten, please.
Kirsten, please don't go in there.

59:59.594 --> 01:00:03.699
Kirsten, don't go in there!
Kirsten, don't go in there! Kirsten!

01:00:03.799 --> 01:00:06.801
Casey, Casey, it's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay. I'm calling an ambulance.

01:00:06.901 --> 01:00:09.271
Kristen, open the door!

01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:16.615
Open the door!

01:00:17.063 --> 01:00:19.637
Open the door!

01:00:20.182 --> 01:00:23.023
Open the door!

01:00:29.891 --> 01:00:33.484
Open it! Open the door!

01:00:38.933 --> 01:00:40.825
Kirsten, open the door!

01:00:42.504 --> 01:00:46.558
Open the door! Kirsten, open the door!

01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:08.363
Oh, Kirsten, I'm sorry!

01:01:08.463 --> 01:01:13.090
Kirsten! I'm sorry! Kirsten, I'm sorry.

01:01:13.735 --> 01:01:17.999
Kristen, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:21.456
No! No! No!

01:04:04.039 --> 01:04:06.770
I'm so sorry.

01:04:08.693 --> 01:04:10.812
- Did she sleep with him?
- Jared...

01:04:10.912 --> 01:04:13.404
Did she sleep with him?

01:04:23.858 --> 01:04:27.484
- I never would have done that to her.
- I know.

01:04:27.979 --> 01:04:33.057
- I would have loved her and only her.
- I know. I know. I'm so sorry.

01:04:35.403 --> 01:04:38.862
Jared, you deserve so much better.

01:04:42.577 --> 01:04:44.402
I...

01:04:45.747 --> 01:04:48.339
She never saw you.

01:04:49.484 --> 01:04:52.610
She never saw you like I did.

01:06:07.629 --> 01:06:09.698
Oh, Jared.

01:08:09.297 --> 01:08:11.588
Stop it!

01:09:13.581 --> 01:09:15.471
Casey?

01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:23.613
Casey, are you there?

01:09:29.529 --> 01:09:31.569
Casey.

01:09:47.548 --> 01:09:49.406
Casey?

01:09:56.357 --> 01:09:58.753
Are you here?

01:10:09.237 --> 01:10:11.695
What the fuck is that?

01:10:20.682 --> 01:10:24.576
Casey, if you can hear me...

01:10:26.025 --> 01:10:28.608
say something.

01:10:54.182 --> 01:10:57.450
Oh, my God! Casey!

01:12:19.801 --> 01:12:22.058
Oh, my God.

01:12:23.037 --> 01:12:26.504
Casey, what happened to you?

01:12:29.043 --> 01:12:31.534
Casey, please.

01:12:31.979 --> 01:12:34.404
We can get you help.

01:12:35.583 --> 01:12:37.752
We'll go to the hospital.

01:12:37.852 --> 01:12:40.277
You're going to be okay.

01:12:41.923 --> 01:12:44.980
It's really not that bad.

01:12:48.696 --> 01:12:50.521
People...

01:12:53.034 --> 01:12:56.193
People always get sick after vacations.

01:12:57.204 --> 01:13:00.063
I'm sure they've seen this before.

01:13:21.395 --> 01:13:23.197
<i>Stop.</i>

01:13:42.583 --> 01:13:44.719
<i>Stop. Stop.</i>

01:13:44.819 --> 01:13:47.410
<i>You gotta stop.</i>

01:14:00.534 --> 01:14:04.961
You... let that happen to me.

01:14:06.974 --> 01:14:08.242
You watched me.

01:14:08.342 --> 01:14:11.545
No. I didn't realize
where he was taking you.

01:14:11.645 --> 01:14:14.686
- Remember? He was a nice guy, just...
- Liar!

01:14:17.018 --> 01:14:19.735
Please don't hurt me!

01:14:20.755 --> 01:14:23.491
Please! Don't hurt me, please!

01:14:23.591 --> 01:14:28.129
You let him take me,
because you wanted me to suffer.

01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:31.399
No. No. No, I don't.

01:14:31.899 --> 01:14:34.535
Or is it because you want him?

01:14:34.635 --> 01:14:37.726
- Casey, I wouldn't...
- You did!

01:14:38.105 --> 01:14:40.163
I know.

01:14:41.242 --> 01:14:43.500
I heard.

01:14:51.652 --> 01:14:53.321
Call to him.

01:14:53.421 --> 01:14:56.613
Please. Please don't, Casey.

01:14:56.991 --> 01:15:01.251
You love him. So call to him.

01:15:02.129 --> 01:15:05.133
Please. Please don't. Please?

01:15:17.912 --> 01:15:19.613
Call to him.

01:15:19.713 --> 01:15:21.449
Jared.

01:15:21.549 --> 01:15:23.384
Louder.

01:15:23.484 --> 01:15:25.953
- Jared.
- Louder!

01:15:26.053 --> 01:15:29.246
- Jared.
- Louder!

01:15:36.063 --> 01:15:39.689
- Louder!
- Jared!

01:15:47.508 --> 01:15:50.402
Jared!

01:15:59.653 --> 01:16:02.256
Jill? Casey?

01:16:02.356 --> 01:16:04.581
Jared!

01:16:12.199 --> 01:16:13.634
I'm here. I'm here, okay?

01:16:13.734 --> 01:16:16.184
- I can't move. I can't move.
- What's happening?

01:16:16.284 --> 01:16:18.372
Please, you gotta get me out of here.
Get me out of here!

01:16:18.472 --> 01:16:21.209
- What happened?
- She's a monster.

01:16:21.309 --> 01:16:26.114
- Who is? Where's Casey?
- Casey's gone. She's gone.

01:16:26.214 --> 01:16:28.482
- Okay. Okay.
- She's just gone. I don't know.

01:16:28.582 --> 01:16:32.506
- Talk to me. Where's Casey?
- Get me out of here!

01:16:40.795 --> 01:16:42.997
Hello, Jared.

01:16:43.097 --> 01:16:44.953
Jesus.

01:16:45.802 --> 01:16:47.687
Casey?

01:16:50.871 --> 01:16:53.541
Do you still think I'm pretty?

01:16:53.641 --> 01:16:57.278
- What happened to you?
- Do you still want to have babies with me?

01:16:57.378 --> 01:16:59.273
- Please. Please don't.
- Shut up!

01:16:59.373 --> 01:17:03.985
Look, Casey, I don't understand...
Just talk to me.

01:17:04.285 --> 01:17:06.887
Casey? Casey?

01:17:07.248 --> 01:17:10.124
- Somebody help!
- Shut up!

01:17:15.997 --> 01:17:19.734
No. No. No. No.

01:17:20.534 --> 01:17:24.204
Jill? Jill? No. No. No.

01:17:38.102 --> 01:17:40.472
Why would you do that?

01:17:41.622 --> 01:17:43.458
Instinct.

01:18:02.276 --> 01:18:04.102
Stop.

01:18:07.681 --> 01:18:11.652
I'm sorry, Jared. I'm sorry.

01:18:11.752 --> 01:18:16.510
- What's wrong with you?
- It's just... it's just a little bug bite.

01:18:18.792 --> 01:18:22.419
Will you help me? Please?

01:18:23.730 --> 01:18:25.175
Please?

01:18:28.202 --> 01:18:30.060
Please.

01:18:31.739 --> 01:18:33.563
Yeah.

01:18:34.942 --> 01:18:36.430
Good.

01:21:29.667 --> 01:21:31.799
Alright, stay back.

01:21:31.899 --> 01:21:35.406
Keep back, please. Keep back. Thank you.

01:21:35.506 --> 01:21:37.530
Excuse me.

01:22:29.410 --> 01:22:31.945
Jesus Christ.

01:22:35.516 --> 01:22:38.118
We're gonna need backup,
to help quarantine this unit.

01:22:38.218 --> 01:22:41.223
I need E.M.S. and Hazmat, A.S.A.P.

01:22:50.931 --> 01:22:52.755
Clear!

01:23:11.117 --> 01:23:13.778
Someone's alive in here.

01:23:38.278 --> 01:23:41.922
Oh, my God. Last time we went on vacation,
I got so sunburned,

01:23:42.022 --> 01:23:44.251
literally like,
bubbling up on my shoulders.

01:23:44.351 --> 01:23:48.055
Come on! Don't tell me that.

01:23:48.155 --> 01:23:50.291
I just want to enjoy this trip.

01:23:50.391 --> 01:23:53.027
Just tired of hearing
everyone's travel horror stories.

01:23:53.127 --> 01:23:56.786
I'm just telling you so you
don't make the same mistake.

01:23:57.534 --> 01:24:00.001
Get plenty of sunscreen.

01:24:00.134 --> 01:24:03.738
I am telling you,
the sun in Costa Rica, is relentless.

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:06.707
Your pale skin
is gonna light up like a match.

01:24:06.807 --> 01:24:09.009
I'm not an idiot. I'll wear sunscreen.

01:24:09.109 --> 01:24:13.480
Okay, I'm not an idiot either,
and it happened to me. I'm just saying.

01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:17.117
I just wanna go away, and relax
and not worry about anything.

01:24:17.217 --> 01:24:21.204
Sunburns, I can deal with.
I just don't want to get sick.

01:24:21.304 --> 01:24:23.790
Ouch!

01:24:25.092 --> 01:24:29.352
Oh, my God. That is so disgusting!

01:24:31.898 --> 01:24:33.834
Are you okay?

01:24:33.934 --> 01:24:37.969
Yeah, it's just a little bite.
