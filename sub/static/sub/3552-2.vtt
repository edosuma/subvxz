WEBVTT

00:01.032 --> 00:02.033
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.033 --> 00:03.274
(laughs)
 LADIES.

00:03.274 --> 00:05.476
RENEE WAS CHARMED
BY THE NEW NEIGHBOR.

00:05.476 --> 00:07.208
DIBS.

00:07.208 --> 00:10.241
TRYING TO PROTECT GABY,
CARLOS COMMITTED MURDER.

00:10.241 --> 00:14.785
WE ARE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE
TO TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THIS.

00:14.785 --> 00:16.387
ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE
TO LIVE WITH THAT?

00:16.387 --> 00:19.150
AND THE WOMEN SWORE TO KEEP
THE SECRET.

00:19.150 --> 00:22.323
BUT THEN BREE
RECEIVED A WARNING.

00:29.060 --> 00:30.431
(Mary Alice) WHEN I WAS ALIVE,

00:30.431 --> 00:35.035
BREE VAN DE KAMP
WAS ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS.

00:35.035 --> 00:40.611
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAD
SO MUCH IN COMMON.

00:40.611 --> 00:45.346
LIKE BREE, I ALSO RECEIVED
A MENACING LETTER--

00:45.346 --> 00:48.249
ONE THAT THREATENED TO SHATTER
THE PERFECT LIFE

00:48.249 --> 00:52.523
I HAD WORKED SO HARD TO CREATE.

00:52.523 --> 00:58.289
YOU SEE, I HAD ONCE COMMITTED
A DESPERATE ACT OF MY OWN.

00:58.289 --> 01:02.593
AND DESPITE MY BEST EFFORTS
TO CONCEAL IT,

01:02.593 --> 01:07.198
SOMEONE FOUND OUT AND WAS
DETERMINED TO EXPOSE ME.

01:09.100 --> 01:12.643
I THOUGHT ABOUT
TELLING MY FRIENDS.

01:12.643 --> 01:16.847
BUT I DECIDED
NOT TO BURDEN THEM.

01:16.847 --> 01:20.511
I HAD HOPED
THAT WITH ONE FINAL ACT,

01:20.511 --> 01:23.454
I COULD CONSIGN MY DEEDS
TO HISTORY.

01:23.454 --> 01:26.517
BUT I HAD FORGOTTEN
THAT HISTORY...
 (click)

01:26.517 --> 01:30.261
HAS A WAY OF REPEATING ITSELF.

01:34.425 --> 01:36.827
SOMETHING INTERESTING?
 (gasps)

01:36.827 --> 01:41.672
NO. NO, JUST A... LETTER...

01:41.672 --> 01:45.376
FROM A FRIEND WHO I HAVEN'T,
UH, HEARD FROM IN A WHILE.

01:45.376 --> 01:47.408
YOU OKAY?

01:47.408 --> 01:49.580
I'M FINE.

01:49.580 --> 01:51.212
I'M JUST ANNOYED

01:51.212 --> 01:55.786
BECAUSE THE, UH, POSTMAN LEFT ME
GABY'S WATER BILL AGAIN.

01:55.786 --> 01:58.549
YOU GO IN. I'LL JUST
PUT IT BACK IN THE BOX.

01:58.549 --> 02:00.851
ALL RIGHT.

02:04.495 --> 02:06.657
(door closes)

02:16.437 --> 02:17.908
(gasps) OH, KAREN.

02:17.908 --> 02:20.641
YOU SCARED ME. WHAT ARE
YOU DOING OUT SO LATE?

02:20.641 --> 02:23.844
WHAT AM I, A CAT? I'M ALLOWED
TO BE OUT PAST 10:00.

02:23.844 --> 02:28.179
I'M SORRY. HAVE YOU SEEN
ANYONE NEAR MY MAILBOX?

02:28.179 --> 02:29.680
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

02:29.680 --> 02:34.154
I JUST... GOT A LETTER.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.286
AN OBSCENE LETTER.

02:35.286 --> 02:36.757
THAT'S ALL?

02:36.757 --> 02:39.390
YOU OUGHTA BE HAPPY THAT SOMEONE
STILL FINDS YOU OBSCENE.

02:39.390 --> 02:42.363
LAST WEEK, I GOT CALLED "SIR"
THREE TIMES.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.365
KAREN! THIS IS SERIOUS.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.937
I NEED TO FIND OUT WHO PUT
THIS LETTER IN MY MAILBOX.

02:46.937 --> 02:49.840
WOW,
YOU'RE REALLY SHAKEN UP.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.172
YES, I AM.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.374
THIS IS VERY UPSETTING,

02:53.374 --> 02:55.806
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

02:55.806 --> 02:58.779
IT'S JUST A NOTE, BREE.
LET IT GO.

03:01.952 --> 03:06.917
YES, BREE VAN DE KAMP AND I
HAD SO MUCH IN COMMON.

03:06.917 --> 03:10.761
WE SHARED SIMILAR LIVES.

03:10.761 --> 03:13.724
AND NOW BREE
FOUND HERSELF PRAYING

03:13.724 --> 03:17.398
THAT WE WOULDN'T
SHARE A SIMILAR FATE.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.843
IN THE DIVIDED WORLD
OF THE SUBURBS,

03:32.843 --> 03:36.717
EVERYONE IS LOOKING
FOR A WAY TO CONNECT.

03:36.717 --> 03:41.722
THEY FEND OFF LONELINESS
WITH CASUAL CONVERSATION.

03:41.722 --> 03:46.857
THEY SHARE OLD TREASURES
WITH A YOUNG FRIEND.

03:46.857 --> 03:51.231
THEY HELP A NEIGHBOR
MAKE A DIFFICULT MOVE.

03:53.504 --> 03:55.366
BUT FOR CARLOS AND GABY SOLIS,

03:55.366 --> 03:57.938
THE ONLY CONNECTION
THAT MATTERED

03:57.938 --> 04:00.971
WAS THE ROMANTIC ONE.

04:00.971 --> 04:03.814
AND WHEN IT CAME
TO MAINTAINING IT,

04:03.814 --> 04:08.279
GABY WAS WILLING TO PULL OUT
ALL THE STOPS.

04:08.279 --> 04:09.249
(pop)

04:09.249 --> 04:11.922
(sighs)
WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING?

04:11.922 --> 04:14.655
A NEW RECORD. IT'S BEEN 38 DAYS
SINCE WE LAST HAD SEX,

04:14.655 --> 04:17.288
AND THAT STREAK
IS ENDING TONIGHT.

04:17.288 --> 04:18.488
SERIOUSLY,
IT'S BEEN THAT LONG?

04:18.488 --> 04:20.361
38 DAYS.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.833
THAT'S LIKE THREE YEARS
IN HOO-HAH TIME.

04:22.833 --> 04:24.465
(chuckles)
SWEETIE, I WOULD LOVE TO,

04:24.465 --> 04:26.266
BUT I HAVEWAY
 TOO MUCH WORK TO DO.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.739
UNH-UNH. NO, NO.
NO EXCUSES.

04:28.739 --> 04:30.841
I CHANGED THE SHEETS,
SHAVED MY LEGS,

04:30.841 --> 04:32.303
AND DUMPED THE KIDS
AT McCLUSKEY'S,

04:32.303 --> 04:35.346
SO DROP YOUR PANTS, COWBOY,
AND SADDLE UP.

04:37.007 --> 04:38.309
YES, MA'AM.

04:38.309 --> 04:41.512
OH! (laughing)

04:47.888 --> 04:51.322
DON'T FEEL BAD.
IT HAPPENS TO LOTS OF MEN.

04:51.322 --> 04:55.025
NOT TO ME. NOT TO US.

04:55.025 --> 04:56.327
(sighs)

04:56.327 --> 04:57.968
WELL, ITHASBEEN 38 DAYS.

04:57.968 --> 05:00.030
MAYBE THE POOR LITTLE GUY
FORGOT WHAT TO DO.

05:00.030 --> 05:01.301
NOT HELPING.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.603
OH.

05:02.603 --> 05:05.436
LISTEN, YOU'VE BEEN UNDER
A LOT OF STRESS LATELY.

05:05.436 --> 05:07.938
SO RELAX.

05:07.938 --> 05:09.309
HOW ABOUT I GIVE YOU
A NICE MASSAGE,

05:09.309 --> 05:12.012
WE FINISH THE CHAMPAGNE,
AND LATER WE TRY AGAIN?

05:12.012 --> 05:14.845
GABY, THANKS, BUT IT'S
NOT GONNA WORK, OKAY?

05:20.351 --> 05:22.092
(sighs)

05:23.594 --> 05:28.829
LIKE CARLOS, SUSAN DELFINO
WAS ALSO FEELING DISCONNECTED.

05:28.829 --> 05:33.664
HER GUILT MADE THE WORLD
A STRANGE AND SCARY PLACE...

05:33.664 --> 05:35.806
(brakes squeal)

05:35.806 --> 05:39.970
WHERE SHE COULD BE EXPOSED
AT ANY MOMENT.

05:39.970 --> 05:44.114
HEY! HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

05:44.114 --> 05:46.046
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.378
WHAT?

05:47.378 --> 05:49.119
YEAH, AND YOU'RE NOT
GETTING AWAY WITH IT.

05:49.119 --> 05:51.382
YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD WALK OUT
WITH A CASE OF SODA

05:51.382 --> 05:52.653
AND NO ONE WOULD NOTICE?

05:52.653 --> 05:56.987
OH. UH... (laughs)

05:56.987 --> 05:58.929
I-I FORGOT
THOSE WERE DOWN THERE.

05:58.929 --> 06:01.932
YEAH. RIGHT. I'VE NEVER
HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE.

06:01.932 --> 06:04.134
MA'AM, I'M GONNA ASK YOU
TO STEP AWAY FROM THE CART

06:04.134 --> 06:05.966
AND KEEP YOUR HANDS
WHERE I CAN SEE 'EM.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.398
(panting)
EVERYTHING OKAY HERE?

06:07.398 --> 06:09.099
IF YOU CONSIDER
LARCENY OKAY.

06:09.099 --> 06:10.771
MRS. DELFINO,

06:10.771 --> 06:14.374
ON BEHALF OF FAIRVIEW MARKET,
I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR KEVIN.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.476
SEEMS WE'RE ALL PAYING THE PRICE

06:15.476 --> 06:18.108
FOR HIS REJECTION
FROM THE POLICE ACADEMY.

06:18.108 --> 06:20.681
OH, WELL, EXCUSE ME FOR
NOT WANTING TO LIVE IN A WORLD

06:20.681 --> 06:21.952
WHERE PEOPLE
CAN COMMIT CRIMES

06:21.952 --> 06:24.014
WITHOUT SUFFERING
THE CONSEQUENCES.

06:24.014 --> 06:26.617
YOUARE A CRIMINAL.

06:26.617 --> 06:30.661
I'VE KNOWN MRS. DELFINO
FOR YEARS.

06:30.661 --> 06:33.023
SHE PAYS FOR THE GRAPES
SHE EATS IN THE PRODUCE SECTION.

06:33.023 --> 06:36.066
SHE WOULD NEVER DO
ANYTHING BAD.

06:36.066 --> 06:38.128
SURE, I WOULD.

06:38.128 --> 06:39.470
WHAT?

06:39.470 --> 06:42.032
YOU DON'T KNOW ME AT ALL.

06:42.032 --> 06:45.075
I'M A VERY BAD PERSON.
I DID A HORRIBLE THING.

06:45.075 --> 06:46.877
I DESERVE TO BE PUNISHED.

06:46.877 --> 06:49.910
LET ME CUFF HER. I HAVE CUFFS.
I BROUGHT 'EM FROM HOME.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.081
NO ONE'S GETTING CUFFED.

06:51.081 --> 06:54.114
JUST... PAY FOR THE SODA
NEXT TIME YOU COME IN.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.517
NO, NO, NO.
NO, YOU NEED TO MARCH ME INSIDE

06:56.517 --> 06:59.089
AND MAKE ME PAY NOW.
 MRS. DELFINO--

06:59.089 --> 07:00.891
I'M SERIOUS.

07:00.891 --> 07:02.152
(clicking)

07:02.152 --> 07:06.657
MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF ME
TO DETER OTHER CRIMINALS.

07:08.699 --> 07:10.531
FINE. TAKE HER IN.
 COPY THAT.

07:12.703 --> 07:16.637
YEP. DID THE CRIME.
DOING THE TIME.

07:16.637 --> 07:20.210
DEAD MAN WALKING.

07:20.210 --> 07:23.173
(sighs)

07:23.173 --> 07:24.575
SO WHAT'S THE DAMAGE?

07:24.575 --> 07:26.777
AN ARM AND A LEG?
JUST AN ARM?

07:26.777 --> 07:29.119
(sighs) NOT EVEN A FINGER.
IT'S A CRACKED FITTING.

07:29.119 --> 07:30.521
I SWAPPED IT OUT.
IT'S NO CHARGE.

07:30.521 --> 07:32.583
REALLY?
THE FIRST GUY I CALLED

07:32.583 --> 07:34.154
SAID I HAD TO RE-PIPE
THE WHOLE HOUSE.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.586
OH, IT'S A SCAM.

07:35.586 --> 07:37.187
THESE PIPES ARE
TOP-OF-THE-LINE COPPER.

07:37.187 --> 07:39.459
THE GUY THAT PUT 'EM IN
DID A GREAT JOB.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.833
HOW DOYOUKNOW?
 IT WAS ME. (chuckles)

07:42.833 --> 07:45.095
YOU JUST SAVED ME 10 GRAND.

07:45.095 --> 07:47.197
NO WONDER PEOPLE SAY
SUCH GOOD THINGS ABOUT YOU.

07:47.197 --> 07:49.770
(laughs) WELL...

07:49.770 --> 07:51.642
WHAT ARE NEIGHBORS FOR?

07:51.642 --> 07:53.674
NEED ANYTHING ELSE,
JUST HOLLER.

07:53.674 --> 07:57.578
ACTUALLY,
THEREISONE THING.

07:57.578 --> 07:58.979
I'M A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER,

07:58.979 --> 08:01.181
ABOUT TO BREAK GROUND
ON A NEW PROJECT,

08:01.181 --> 08:03.554
AND, UH, I'M LOOKING
FOR SOME HELP--

08:03.554 --> 08:05.856
LOCAL GUYS
THAT I CAN TRUST.

08:05.856 --> 08:07.017
YOU INTERESTED?

08:07.017 --> 08:10.490
(sets box down)

08:17.668 --> 08:19.900
HEY, MIKE. GOT A MINUTE?

08:19.900 --> 08:21.732
UM... HEY, RENEE.

08:21.732 --> 08:23.534
WE'RE FRIENDS, RIGHT?

08:23.534 --> 08:24.875
WELL...

08:24.875 --> 08:27.277
OH, COME ON.
YOU FIXED MY TOILET FOR FREE.

08:27.277 --> 08:29.540
UM, THAT WASN'T FREE.
I SENT YOU A BILL.

08:29.540 --> 08:31.011
YOU JUST HAVEN'T PAID IT.

08:31.011 --> 08:35.115
(laughs)

08:35.115 --> 08:38.518
AHH. ANYWAY, LOOK,
HERE'S THE DEAL.

08:38.518 --> 08:42.623
UH, BEN LIKES ME.
HE JUST DOESN'T KNOW IT YET.

08:42.623 --> 08:46.026
NOW I NEED TO FIND THAT THING
THAT WE CONNECT ON.

08:46.026 --> 08:49.229
YOU'VE BEEN ON THE INSIDE.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT HIM?

08:49.229 --> 08:53.033
WELL, HE'S GOT COPPER PIPES.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.234
SOMETHING PERSONAL.

08:54.234 --> 08:57.608
I SAW A BOX OF CHEERIOS...
AND A COFFEEMAKER.

08:57.608 --> 09:00.170
HE MUST LIKE COFFEE.
UNLESS IT'S FOR GUESTS.

09:00.170 --> 09:02.272
OH, MY GOD. I GOT MORE
OUT OF THE CABLE GUY,

09:02.272 --> 09:04.044
AND HE'S DEAF.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.977
DOES HE HAVE ANY PHOTOS?
ARTWORK? THINK, DELFINO, THINK!
 (pounds door)

09:06.977 --> 09:08.148
OKAY.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.581
OKAY. UM...

09:10.581 --> 09:11.982
THERE WAS THIS PLAQUE
FROM THE MAYOR--

09:11.982 --> 09:14.084
SOMETHING ABOUT HIS WORK
WITH THE ELDERLY.

09:14.084 --> 09:15.185
REALLY?

09:15.185 --> 09:18.789
HE LIKES THE ELDERLY?

09:18.789 --> 09:20.560
WELL, I LIKE THE ELDERLY.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.262
SINCE WHEN?

09:22.262 --> 09:24.635
OH. OLD PEOPLE
ARE ADORABLE.

09:24.635 --> 09:27.237
I LOVE
THEIR LITTLE RAISIN FACES

09:27.237 --> 09:30.040
AND THOSE TENNIS BALLS
THEY PUT ON THEIR WALKERS.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.802
THANKS FOR THE TIP...

09:31.802 --> 09:34.705
FRIEND.

09:34.705 --> 09:37.007
(sighs)

09:37.007 --> 09:39.079
(door opens)

09:39.079 --> 09:40.210
MOM!

09:40.210 --> 09:41.281
HEY, HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

09:41.281 --> 09:43.654
AWESOME.
DAD'S HOTEL IS SO COOL.

09:43.654 --> 09:45.355
WE WENT SWIMMING IN THE POOL
AND PLAYED MARCO POLO

09:45.355 --> 09:47.287
AND CANNONBALLED
OFF THE DIVING BOARD.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.588
WHY DON'T WE HAVE A POOL?

09:48.588 --> 09:50.220
AND THEN WE GOT HAMBURGERS
AND FRENCH FRIES

09:50.220 --> 09:52.062
AND SUPER-SIZED
CHERRY COLA SLUSHIES.

09:52.062 --> 09:54.665
(slurps)
 AH. SUGARANDCAFFEINE.

09:54.665 --> 09:57.097
I GUESS YOU FIGURED
THEY WERE TOO YOUNG FOR METH?

09:57.097 --> 09:59.229
IT'S JUST A SLUSHIE.

09:59.229 --> 10:00.300
ON A SCHOOL NIGHT.
SHE'S GONNA BE UP TILL 2:00 A.M.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.332
JUST 'CAUSE YOU COULDN'T
SAY "NO."

10:02.332 --> 10:03.874
YOU'RE BLOWING THIS
OUT OF PROPORTION.

10:03.874 --> 10:05.275
WHO WANTS TO PLAY MEGA MONOPOLY?

10:05.275 --> 10:07.337
IT'S JUST LIKE REGULAR MONOPOLY
BUT WITH MORE STUFF.

10:07.337 --> 10:09.710
YOU JUST KEEP PLAYING
AND PLAYING

10:09.710 --> 10:11.011
AND PLAYING AND PLAYING
AND PLAYING...

10:11.011 --> 10:13.083
YEAH.WAY OUT OF PROPORTION.

10:13.083 --> 10:16.086
LOOK, NOW THAT WE'RE
REALLY SEPARATED,

10:16.086 --> 10:18.048
I REFUSE TO BE
THE BAD GUY ALL THE TIME.

10:18.048 --> 10:20.390
YOU HAVE GOT TO LEARN
TO SAY "NO."

10:20.390 --> 10:22.322
I SAY IT.
 (scoffs)

10:22.322 --> 10:24.254
TONIGHT WHEN WE WALKED PAST
THE PET SHOP,

10:24.254 --> 10:25.325
THEY WANTED A SPIDER MONKEY.
I SAID "NO."

10:25.325 --> 10:28.699
I'M SERIOUS.
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW.

10:28.699 --> 10:30.230
I'M NOT GONNA LET THIS BE
THE HOUSE OF PAIN

10:30.230 --> 10:32.963
WHILE YOU'RE LIVING IT UP
AT THE MTV BEACH HOUSE.

10:32.963 --> 10:35.105
YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:35.105 --> 10:36.807
THINGSAREDIFFERENT NOW.

10:36.807 --> 10:40.410
FOR INSTANCE, I USED TO HAVE TO
STAND HERE AND LISTEN TO THIS.

10:40.410 --> 10:45.145
BUT NOW I'M THINKING...
NO.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.377
(door opens)

10:47.377 --> 10:50.981
HEY, LOOK AT THAT. I'M GETTING
PRETTY GOOD AT THIS "NO" THING.

11:01.091 --> 11:02.132
IT'S BAD ENOUGH WHEN WE WEREN'T
EVEN TRYING TO HAVE SEX,

11:02.132 --> 11:03.694
BUT TO TRY AND FAIL?

11:03.694 --> 11:05.135
WELL, DO YOU THINK
IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO

11:05.135 --> 11:06.937
WITH THE STRESS
CARLOS IS UNDER?

11:06.937 --> 11:09.199
WE'RE ALL UNDER STRESS.
YOU KNOW WHAT'S STRESSFUL?

11:09.199 --> 11:11.671
IS NOT HAVING SEX
FOR 39 1/2 DAYS.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.144
YOU'RE SOUNDING
A LITTLE CALLOUS.

11:14.144 --> 11:17.247
I DON'T MEAN TO. IT'S JUST,
SEX IS IMPORTANT TO US.

11:17.247 --> 11:21.151
EVEN IN OUR TOUGHEST TIMES, IT'S
WHAT ALWAYS HELD US TOGETHER.

11:21.151 --> 11:23.784
IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT, I'M
WORRIED WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO US.

11:23.784 --> 11:24.815
I GET THAT.

11:24.815 --> 11:25.916
SO... COME ON, GIRLS.

11:25.916 --> 11:29.159
HOW CAN I SPICE THINGS UP
IN THE BEDROOM?

11:30.791 --> 11:32.062
IS THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENING?

11:32.062 --> 11:35.395
GABRIELLE SOLIS IS
ASKINGUSFOR SEX TIPS?

11:35.395 --> 11:37.327
I KNOW! IT'S THE APOCALYPSE.

11:37.327 --> 11:39.269
WELL, IF YOU DON'T MIND
HARSH LIGHTING

11:39.269 --> 11:42.232
AND BLATANT MISOGYNY,
YOU CAN ALWAYS WATCH A PORNO.

11:42.232 --> 11:44.004
WATCHED ONE. FILMED ONE. NEXT.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.136
THIS MAY SHOCK YOU,

11:46.136 --> 11:50.280
BUT SOMETIMES MIKE AND I
LIKE DOING IT IN PUBLIC.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.282
HUH. THOSE OF US WHO WANDERED

11:52.282 --> 11:54.785
BY SANTA'S WORKSHOP
AT THE CHRISTMAS CARNIVAL--

11:54.785 --> 11:57.087
NOT THAT SHOCKED.

11:57.087 --> 11:58.448
YOU COULD TRY ROLE-PLAYING.

11:58.448 --> 12:00.720
ONCE, I DRESSED UP
IN A FRENCH MAID'S COSTUME,

12:00.720 --> 12:02.953
AND ORSON PRETENDED TO BE
A STUBBORN STAIN,

12:02.953 --> 12:05.025
AND WHY IS EVERYBODY
LOOKING AT ME?

12:05.025 --> 12:08.058
SERIOUSLY, GUYS,
I NEED SOMENEWMOVES.

12:08.058 --> 12:10.060
WELL, THERE'S THIS ONE MOM
AT SCHOOL--

12:10.060 --> 12:11.762
AND I PROMISED
I WOULDN'T USE HER NAME--

12:11.762 --> 12:14.334
BETTY CUNNINGHAM--WHO HIRED
A STRIPPER TO TEACH HER

12:14.334 --> 12:16.506
HOW TO GIVE HER HUSBAND
A LAP DANCE.

12:16.506 --> 12:17.868
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
A STRIPPER COULD TEACHME,

12:17.868 --> 12:19.239
BUT IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

12:19.239 --> 12:22.012
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'S GONNA WORK?

12:22.012 --> 12:23.513
WHY WOULDN'T IT?

12:25.015 --> 12:28.478
BECAUSE... I GET WHERE
CARLOS IS COMING FROM.

12:28.478 --> 12:32.152
THIS KIND OF GUILT CAN
REALLY MESS WITH YOUR HEAD.

12:33.924 --> 12:35.485
SOMETHING YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT?

12:37.057 --> 12:38.758
OKAY, THE OTHER DAY,

12:38.758 --> 12:41.792
I ACCIDENTALLY TOOK A CASE
OF SODA FROM THE SUPERMARKET,

12:41.792 --> 12:43.834
AND THE SECURITY GUARD
STARTED YELLING AT ME.

12:43.834 --> 12:45.495
AND AT FIRST, I WAS LIKE, "NO,"

12:45.495 --> 12:48.038
BUT THEN I WAS LIKE
"YES, I DESERVE IT.

12:48.038 --> 12:49.870
I DESERVE TO BE PUNISHED."

12:49.870 --> 12:52.803
IT FELT RIGHT TO BE
PUBLICLY HUMILIATED LIKE THAT,

12:52.803 --> 12:54.905
AND WHY IS EVERYBODY
LOOKING AT ME?

12:54.905 --> 12:58.008
'CAUSE THERE'S A BUCKET OF CRAZY
WHERE YOUR HEAD USED TO BE.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.282
SO NOW I'M CRAZY.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.285
I THOUGHT YOU SAID I COULD
TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS STUFF.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.887
YOU CAN,

13:06.887 --> 13:08.188
AND WE APPRECIATE WHAT
YOU'RE GRAPPLING WITH,

13:08.188 --> 13:12.062
BUT YOU CANNOT GO AROUND
ATTRACTING ATTENTION LIKE THAT.

13:12.062 --> 13:13.223
IT'S NOT SAFE.

13:13.223 --> 13:14.825
EXACTLY.

13:14.825 --> 13:16.967
SO KNOCK IT OFF AND GO GET ME
SOME MORE COFFEE!

13:19.799 --> 13:22.833
WHAT? SHE LIKES TO BE YELLED AT.

13:25.035 --> 13:26.907
HEY, YOU.

13:26.907 --> 13:30.240
UH, I THOUGHT YOU WERE,
UH, AT WORK.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.282
I PRONOUNCE
THE CITY OF FAIRVIEW

13:32.282 --> 13:34.584
SAFE ENOUGH
TO HAVE LUNCH WITH MY GIRL.

13:34.584 --> 13:36.887
OH, THAT WOULD BE LOVELY,

13:36.887 --> 13:40.190
BUT I HAVE SOMETHING
I NEED TO DO. SHOOT.

13:41.952 --> 13:43.523
OH, YEAH? LIKE WHAT?

13:43.523 --> 13:45.525
WHAT?

13:45.525 --> 13:49.029
UNLESS IT'S A--
IT'S A BIG SECRET.

13:50.901 --> 13:53.563
ISIT A BIG SECRET?

13:53.563 --> 13:56.066
CHUCK.

13:56.066 --> 13:58.008
I'M SORRY. YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:58.008 --> 14:00.110
I...

14:00.110 --> 14:02.612
YOU DON'T OWE ME
ANY EXPLANATIONS.

14:04.844 --> 14:08.078
I JUST... I JUST NEED
TO KNOW THAT WE'RE OKAY.

14:08.078 --> 14:09.379
CHUCK...

14:09.379 --> 14:12.082
MY FEELINGS FOR YOU
HAVE NOT CHANGED,

14:12.082 --> 14:14.054
JUST MY SCHEDULE
FOR THE DAY.

14:14.054 --> 14:14.955
MWAH.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.856
WELL, THAT'S GOOD,

14:16.856 --> 14:18.858
BECAUSE SUSPICION CAN BE
A GREAT TRAIT IN POLICE WORK,

14:18.858 --> 14:21.191
BUT IT'S HORRIBLE
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

14:21.191 --> 14:23.463
JUST ASK MY EX.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.066
I NEVER WANNA BE
THAT GUY AGAIN.

14:32.502 --> 14:34.274
(door opens and closes)

14:46.056 --> 14:49.019
(loudly) HELLO THERE, KAREN.

14:49.019 --> 14:50.290
"KAREN"?

14:50.290 --> 14:53.193
WHAT HAPPENED TO "LIVER SPOT"
OR "6 FEET UNDER"

14:53.193 --> 14:55.195
OR ONE OF
YOUR OTHER CUTE NICKNAMES?

14:55.195 --> 14:57.127
NO, NO, I CAN'T COME IN!

14:57.127 --> 15:00.500
I'M JUST DROPPING OFF
ANOTHER HOME-COOKED MEAL!

15:00.500 --> 15:04.104
WHAT MEAL? WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU YELLING FOR?

15:04.104 --> 15:06.576
(under breath)
JUST LIFT THE NAPKIN.

15:06.576 --> 15:09.179
50 BUCKS.
WHAT'S THE CATCH?

15:09.179 --> 15:11.681
DON'T LOOK NOW,
BUT DO YOU SEE BEN OVER THERE?

15:15.045 --> 15:17.117
MM. SUBTLE.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.419
ANYWAY, HE HAS A SOFT SPOT
FOR OLD PEOPLE,

15:19.419 --> 15:23.023
AND AS FAR ASHEKNOWS,
SO DO I.

15:23.023 --> 15:26.356
(loudly) NO, NO,
YOUR CRINKLED LITTLE SMILE

15:26.356 --> 15:29.199
IS THANKS ENOUGH FOR ME.

15:29.199 --> 15:31.001
ARE YOU PETTING ME?

15:31.001 --> 15:33.964
(sighs) JUST SAY NICE THINGS
ABOUT ME TO BEN.

15:33.964 --> 15:36.066
TELL HIM I BRING YOU MEALS,
THAT KIND OF STUFF.

15:36.066 --> 15:39.239
WELL, IT'S A PRETTY BIG FAVOR
FOR 50 BUCKS.

15:39.239 --> 15:42.212
CONSIDERING I DON'T LIKE YOU,
I'LL DO IT FOR $100.

15:42.212 --> 15:43.573
FINE.

15:43.573 --> 15:46.316
TOMORROW I'LL BRING YOU A C-NOTE
AND A JELL-O MOLD. DEAL?

15:46.316 --> 15:47.947
(loudly) OH, RENEE.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.120
BLESS YOUR HEART.
YOU'RE SO GOOD TO ME.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.282
NO,YOU'RETHE ONE
WHO ENRICHESMYLIFE.

15:52.282 --> 15:54.624
THE JOY I GET...

15:54.624 --> 15:57.957
(normal voice)
HANDS OFF. HE'S GONE.

16:01.131 --> 16:03.093
OH, MY GOD.

16:03.093 --> 16:06.166
YOU THINKISENT THIS?

16:06.166 --> 16:08.238
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW THIS MAKES ME FEEL?

16:08.238 --> 16:10.140
FORGIVE ME. I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS POSSIBLE

16:10.140 --> 16:12.172
TO DAMAGE THE SELF-ESTEEM
OF A MURDERER.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.144
ACONFESSEDMURDERER.

16:14.144 --> 16:17.677
AND THIS--THIS IS THE ONLY WAY
YOU CAN SEE ME?

16:17.677 --> 16:19.609
(muffled) PAUL! PAUL.

16:19.609 --> 16:21.251
(pounds)

16:21.251 --> 16:23.153
(sighs)

16:23.153 --> 16:25.155
(muffled) PLEASE.

16:28.288 --> 16:32.192
I'M SORRY. I'VE JUST BEEN
SO PANICKED SINCE I GOT IT.

16:32.192 --> 16:35.765
IT HAS THE EXACT SAME WORDING AS
THE LETTER MARY ALICE RECEIVED.

16:35.765 --> 16:38.368
YES.

16:38.368 --> 16:40.470
THAT'S VERY WEIRD.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.635
BUT WHY ARE YOU
SO WORKED UP ABOUT IT?

16:45.635 --> 16:47.477
(gasps) I BELIEVE MARY ALICE
GOT A LITTLE WORKED UP

16:47.477 --> 16:48.738
WHEN SHE GOT HERS.

16:48.738 --> 16:51.641
BUT SHE WAS HIDING SOMETHING.
YOU AREN'T.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.415
RIGHT?

16:55.415 --> 16:57.747
OF COURSE NOT.

16:57.747 --> 17:00.190
IT'S OBVIOUSLY JUST
A CRUEL PRANK,

17:00.190 --> 17:03.293
BUT I STILL WANNA KNOW
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE.

17:03.293 --> 17:06.526
IT HAD TO BE SOMEONE WHO KNEW
ABOUT THE ORIGINAL NOTE.

17:06.526 --> 17:10.660
WELL, LET'S SEE.
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S MARTHA HUBER.

17:10.660 --> 17:12.502
OBVIOUSLY
SHE DIDN'T SEND IT.

17:12.502 --> 17:14.104
THEN THERE'S YOU,

17:14.104 --> 17:16.306
SUSAN, LYNETTE, GABY.

17:16.306 --> 17:18.167
I ASSUME YOU'VE
ALREADY ASKED THEM.

17:19.769 --> 17:24.314
UH, ACTUALLY, I-I HAVEN'T
MENTIONED IT TO THE GIRLS YET.

17:24.314 --> 17:27.416
I-I STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.

17:27.416 --> 17:29.519
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,

17:29.519 --> 17:31.751
DON'T KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.

17:33.153 --> 17:37.287
IF MARY ALICE HAD SHARED
HER NOTE WITH YOU GIRLS...

17:37.287 --> 17:39.459
THINGS MIGHT HAVE
TURNED OUT...

17:39.459 --> 17:42.061
A WHOLE DIFFERENT WAY.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.474
YOU KNOW IT'S RECYCLING DAY.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.645
SO?

17:55.645 --> 17:57.147
SO IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE ABOUT

17:57.147 --> 17:59.209
TO PUT KITCHEN GARBAGE
IN YOUR RECYCLING BIN.

17:59.209 --> 18:02.612
OH. I HOPE
I DON'T GET PUNISHED.

18:08.688 --> 18:12.091
OH, HERE I AM,
DROPPING A TURKEY CARCASS

18:12.091 --> 18:13.293
IN WITH THE RECYCLING.

18:13.293 --> 18:16.596
AND HERE I AM,
NOT GIVING A CRAP.

18:22.572 --> 18:24.634
UH-OH. YOU GOT ME.

18:24.634 --> 18:26.836
CAN I BUM ONE?

18:26.836 --> 18:28.608
MY OLD LADY MADE ME QUIT.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.741
(sighs)

18:31.741 --> 18:34.614
(mouth full) 17...

18:34.614 --> 18:36.816
18...

18:36.816 --> 18:38.488
19...

18:38.488 --> 18:41.891
THANK GOD.
THOSE WERE FROM LAST WEEK.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.762
HELLO.
UH, BEN, ISN'T IT?

18:52.762 --> 18:54.304
YES.

18:54.304 --> 18:56.636
UH, LISTEN, UH,

18:56.636 --> 18:57.767
I WAS JUST TALKING
TO MRS. McCLUSKEY,

18:57.767 --> 19:02.672
AND I GOTTA SAY,
I REALLY MISJUDGED YOU.

19:02.672 --> 19:04.474
OH?
 YEAH.

19:04.474 --> 19:06.576
SHE WAS TELLING ME
ALL THE WAYS YOU'VE HELPED HER.

19:06.576 --> 19:09.449
WELL, I LIKE TO THINK
I'M DOING GOD'S WORK,

19:09.449 --> 19:13.823
YOU KNOW, UNTIL HE TAKES HER
IN HER SLEEP OR WHAT HAVE YOU.

19:13.823 --> 19:15.385
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNEW THIS,

19:15.385 --> 19:18.428
BUT I'M QUITE INVOLVED
WITH SENIORS MYSELF.

19:18.428 --> 19:22.892
GET OUT! LOOK AT US,
HAVING THINGS IN COMMON.

19:22.892 --> 19:25.265
(chuckles) YEAH.

19:25.265 --> 19:29.699
SO IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE
I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

19:29.699 --> 19:34.374
ACTUALLY, YES.
ARE YOU FREE TONIGHT?

19:35.845 --> 19:37.577
(door creaks)

19:37.577 --> 19:38.678
HEY, BUDDY.

19:38.678 --> 19:39.749
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
FOR DINNER TONIGHT?

19:39.749 --> 19:41.551
(door closes)
 MEXICAN? CHINESE?

19:41.551 --> 19:43.182
ACTUALLY, THERE'S A PARTY
AT RICH COHEN'S

19:43.182 --> 19:44.354
I WAS HOPING TO GO TO.

19:44.354 --> 19:46.586
YEAH? DON'T HOPE TOO HARD.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.717
WHY NOT?

19:47.717 --> 19:49.719
REMEMBER WHEN
RICH TURNED 13?

19:49.719 --> 19:52.692
IT WAS THE ONLY BAR MITZVAH
EVER SHUT DOWN BY THEPOLICE.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.794
I DON'T TRUST HIS PARENTS.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.696
WELL, IF YOU MAKES YOU FEEL
BETTER, THEY'RE OUT OF TOWN.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.868
OOH, AN UNSUPERVISED PARTY?
EVEN BETTER.

19:58.868 --> 20:00.230
WE'RE JUST GONNA BE

20:00.230 --> 20:01.731
EATING PIZZA
AND WATCHING MOVIES AND STUFF,

20:01.731 --> 20:04.274
AND RICH'S OLDER BROTHER
WILL BE THERE.
 (gasps)

20:04.274 --> 20:06.776
PERFECT.
SOMEONE TO BUY THE BEER.

20:06.776 --> 20:10.580
SO YOU'RE SAYING "NO"?
AGAIN?

20:10.580 --> 20:12.342
UH...

20:16.546 --> 20:19.789
I'M NOT SAYING NO.
I'M SAYING ASK YOUR DAD.

20:19.789 --> 20:22.592
HEY! I'M JUST DROPPING OFF
A CHECK.

20:22.592 --> 20:24.724
(door closes)
 HANG ON A SEC. PARKER HAS
SOMETHING HE WANTS TO ASK YOU.

20:25.755 --> 20:27.827
PARKER.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.799
CAN I GO TO A PARTY
AT RICH COHEN'S HOUSE TONIGHT?

20:29.799 --> 20:31.261
WHAT DID YOUR MOM SAY?

20:31.261 --> 20:34.634
HIS MOM SAID HE SHOULD
ASK HIS DAD.

20:34.634 --> 20:38.968
OH. WELL... H-HIS PARENTS
ARE GONNA BE THERE, RIGHT?

20:38.968 --> 20:41.841
NOPE. NO PARENTS.

20:42.972 --> 20:45.475
AND... RICH COHEN--

20:45.475 --> 20:47.647
DIDN'T SOMETHING HAPPEN
AT HIS BAR MITZVAH?

20:47.647 --> 20:49.979
LOTS OF THINGS HAPPENED--
DRINKING, POT SMOKING,

20:49.979 --> 20:51.781
THE WHITTAKER GIRL
GOT PREGNANT.

20:51.781 --> 20:54.324
(chuckles) IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU
ALREADY MADE UP YOUR MIND HERE.

20:54.324 --> 20:56.426
NO, NO, NO.

20:56.426 --> 20:59.529
I HAVE NOT MADE UP MY MIND.
IT IS ENTIRELY UP TO YOU.

20:59.529 --> 21:02.792
YOU HEAR THAT, DAD?
ENTIRELY UP TO YOU.

21:05.495 --> 21:07.637
WELL... I-IT SEEMS LIKE
YOUR MOM DOESN'T THINK

21:07.637 --> 21:09.739
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA--
 I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

21:09.739 --> 21:11.701
I DON'T NOT THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

21:11.701 --> 21:14.273
OH, SO YOUDO
 DO THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.907
I DON'T NOT THINK IT'S NOT...
NOT... A GOOD IDEA.

21:17.907 --> 21:18.978
OKAY, I'M CONFUSED.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.009
WELL, IF YOUR MOM'S
NOT SAYING "NO,"

21:20.009 --> 21:21.411
I'M NOT SAYING "NO" EITHER.

21:21.411 --> 21:22.952
OH! WELL, IF YOUR DAD'S
NOT SAYING "NO,"

21:22.952 --> 21:24.584
I'M SURE AS HELL
NOT GOING TO SAY "NO."

21:24.584 --> 21:25.885
SO IS THAT A "YES"?

21:25.885 --> 21:28.788
WELL... (chuckles)
IT'S NOT A "NO."

21:28.788 --> 21:29.859
SWEET.

21:29.859 --> 21:31.921
(chuckles)

21:31.921 --> 21:35.625
(door opens and closes)

21:37.597 --> 21:38.928
ARE YOU SURE THIS THING
IS SAFE?

21:38.928 --> 21:41.531
MY SON PLAYS FIREMAN ON MINE
ALL THE TIME.

21:41.531 --> 21:42.832
DO YOU WANNA SEE A PICTURE?

21:42.832 --> 21:45.575
LET'S NOT MAKE THIS SADDER
THAN IT IS.

21:45.575 --> 21:47.477
ALL RIGHT, SO MY HUSBAND'S
HAVING A LITTLE PROBLEM

21:47.477 --> 21:49.779
IN THE BEDROOM.
 WITH HIS WIENER?

21:49.779 --> 21:52.311
YES, WITH HIS... WIENER.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.083
WELL, YOU CAN RELAX,
BECAUSE I'M LIKE A DOCTOR,

21:54.083 --> 21:57.617
AND I SEE THIS PROBLEM
ALL THE TIME WITH OLDER WOMEN.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.819
"OLDER"?
(scoffs) EXCUSE ME.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.090
I DON'T THINK OUR AGES
ARE THAT FAR APART.

22:01.090 --> 22:02.492
WHEN WEREYOUBORN?

22:02.492 --> 22:03.723
1992.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.455
ME, TOO. ALL RIGHT,
ENOUGH CHITCHAT.

22:05.455 --> 22:07.397
GIVE ME A TASTE OF WHAT
I'M GONNA LEARN HERE.

22:15.665 --> 22:18.007
OKAY. I'D DO YA.

22:18.007 --> 22:18.938
LET ME TRY.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.740
THAT WAS KIND OF ADVANCED.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.713
I WAS THINKING MAYBE WE COULD
START WITH SOMETHING SIMPLE,

22:23.713 --> 22:25.114
LIKE GRINDING ON A CHAIR.

22:25.114 --> 22:27.076
OKAY, WILL YOU STOP
TREATING ME LIKE A GRANDMA?

22:27.076 --> 22:30.750
I DO YOGA AND ZUMBA
AND KICKBOXING.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.622
I'M IN EXCELLENT SHAPE.

22:32.622 --> 22:35.885
OKAY. (grunting)

22:35.885 --> 22:38.488
NOT BAD.

22:38.488 --> 22:39.989
OKAY, NOW ASS UP,
LEGS OUT,

22:39.989 --> 22:43.733
AND REMEMBER,SLOWIS SEXY.

22:43.733 --> 22:46.035
AAH!
 (thud)

22:46.035 --> 22:47.397
OH, MY GOD.

22:47.397 --> 22:50.840
OHH! OKAY. UH... (grunts)
A LITTLE HARDER THAN IT LOOKS.

22:50.840 --> 22:52.742
NO WORRIES.
YOU'LL PICK IT UP IN NO TIME.

22:52.742 --> 22:54.003
SIX MONTHS TOPS.

22:54.003 --> 22:56.646
WHAT?!
I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG.

22:56.646 --> 22:59.148
I NEEDYOURMOVES,
YOUR BODY...

22:59.148 --> 23:02.952
MY ASS, BUT BASICALLY
I NEED TO BE YOU BY TONIGHT.

23:04.554 --> 23:06.015
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TONIGHT?

23:06.015 --> 23:08.017
I'M HEADLINING
AT DOUBLE D's.

23:08.017 --> 23:09.959
IF I TRIPLE YOUR PAY,

23:09.959 --> 23:13.092
WOULD YOU MIND
BEING THE OPENING ACT HERE?

23:17.627 --> 23:18.868
BEN, I DON'T KNOW HOW
THE FOOD IS,

23:18.868 --> 23:20.530
BUT I ALREADY LOVE
THIS RESTAURANT.

23:20.530 --> 23:22.672
WE ARE
THE YOUNGEST PEOPLE HERE.

23:22.672 --> 23:25.875
OH, THIS ISN'T A RESTAURANT.

23:25.875 --> 23:27.907
(indistinct conversations)

23:27.907 --> 23:29.679
THIS IS THE SENIOR CENTER.

23:29.679 --> 23:32.712
WELCOME TO
THE BEN FAULKNER FUNCTION ROOM.

23:32.712 --> 23:35.985
(scoffs) WE'RE NOT
EATING HERE, ARE WE?

23:35.985 --> 23:38.748
NO, NO, WE'RE SERVING.

23:38.748 --> 23:41.821
WE CAN EAT AFTERWARDS IF
THERE ARE, YOU KNOW, LEFTOVERS.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.993
OH, FUN.

23:43.993 --> 23:48.427
UH, BUT I'M--
I'M A LITTLE UNDERDRESSED.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.631
THERE YOU GO.

23:51.631 --> 23:52.762
THERE. NOW YOU'RE PERFECT.

23:52.762 --> 23:54.534
(slaps back)

23:55.765 --> 23:58.968
GABY, F.Y.I.,
GUYS WHO USED TO BE BLIND

23:58.968 --> 24:00.640
DON'T ENJOY RELIVING IT.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.712
RELAX.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS.

24:02.712 --> 24:04.744
NOW JUST SIT BACK

24:04.744 --> 24:06.646
AND GET READY FOR TAKEOFF.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.785
MMM.

24:15.785 --> 24:16.786
(chuckles)

24:16.786 --> 24:17.727
(giggles) YEAH.

24:17.727 --> 24:21.460
WOW. (chuckles)
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING OUT.

24:21.460 --> 24:25.034
I HAVE... (singsongy)
BUT THAT'S NOT MY ASS.

24:25.034 --> 24:26.696
(whispers)
IT'S A PROFESSIONAL'S.

24:26.696 --> 24:28.668
MEET DAKOTA.

24:28.668 --> 24:31.501
WHAT THE HELL?
WHAT IS THIS?

24:31.501 --> 24:34.143
A GIFT FROM YOUR WIFE.
I WORK AT DOUBLE D's,

24:34.143 --> 24:36.075
OUT BY THE INTERSTATE.

24:36.075 --> 24:38.978
NOT THE ONE BY THE AIRPORT
THAT HAD THE HEPATITIS SCARE.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.480
YOU HIRED A STRIPPER.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.613
ONLY AS A WARM-UP ACT.

24:43.613 --> 24:45.154
THEN LATER ON,
SHE'LL CLEAR OUT,

24:45.154 --> 24:47.887
AND IT'S JUST YOU AND ME
FOR THE MAIN EVENT.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.919
NOPE. NOT DOING THIS.

24:49.919 --> 24:52.792
HANG ON. IDEA. SIT DOWN.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.724
(chuckles)

24:54.724 --> 24:56.195
OH! OKAY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:56.195 --> 24:58.928
I DON'T... OH, MY GOD.
HE'S RIGHT.

24:58.928 --> 25:00.930
YOUR BODY--
IT'S LIKE A DOLPHIN.

25:00.930 --> 25:02.231
GIVE IT A LITTLE SPANK.

25:02.231 --> 25:03.733
NOTHING WILL FIX
HIS PROBLEM QUICKER

25:03.733 --> 25:06.035
THAN A LITTLE
GIRL-ON-GIRL ACTION.

25:06.035 --> 25:07.106
MY "PROBLEM."

25:07.106 --> 25:08.778
(gasps)

25:08.778 --> 25:09.709
YOU TOLD HER.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.881
OKAY, QUICK.
MAKE OUT WITH ME.

25:11.881 --> 25:15.044
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW
EMBARRASSING THIS IS FOR ME?

25:15.044 --> 25:18.147
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
YOU CAN GO NOW.

25:21.891 --> 25:23.553
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT
TO ME?

25:23.553 --> 25:25.795
TRY TO GET OUR SEX LIFE
BACK ON TRACK?

25:25.795 --> 25:27.056
CARLOS, EVEN AT OUR WORST,

25:27.056 --> 25:29.859
THIS IS THE ONE THING
THAT'S ALWAYS WORKED FOR US.

25:29.859 --> 25:31.661
I JUST WANT US
TO GET BACK TO NORMAL.

25:31.661 --> 25:33.733
WE'RE NEVER GOING BACK
TO NORMAL!

25:33.733 --> 25:36.736
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?!

25:36.736 --> 25:40.109
WHAT I DID...

25:40.109 --> 25:42.141
YOU CAN'T WISH IT AWAY.

25:42.141 --> 25:45.214
IT IS WITH ME ALL THE TIME,

25:45.214 --> 25:47.076
WHETHER I'M AWAKE

25:47.076 --> 25:48.978
OR ASLEEP...

25:53.322 --> 25:55.655
OR TRYING
TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU.

25:55.655 --> 25:59.689
I'M SORRY. I JUST WISH
THERE WAS SOMETHING I COULD DO.

26:02.762 --> 26:04.063
THERE'S NOT.

26:08.898 --> 26:11.901
(indistinct conversations)

26:13.572 --> 26:15.905
WHAT'S THAT?

26:15.905 --> 26:18.047
I DON'T KNOW.

26:18.047 --> 26:19.909
IS IT GOOD?

26:19.909 --> 26:21.851
LET ME CLUE YOU IN
ON SOMETHING.

26:21.851 --> 26:25.354
FOOD IS USUALLY
EITHER GOOD OR FREE.

26:27.717 --> 26:29.358
HOW COME YOU'RE DRESSED
SO FANCY?

26:29.358 --> 26:33.092
BECAUSE I'M ON A DATE
WITH THAT HOT AUSSIE OVER THERE.

26:33.092 --> 26:36.866
HE JUST FAILED TO MENTION
WHAT THE DATE WAS.

26:36.866 --> 26:40.599
BEN BROUGHT YOU TO SLING FOOD
DRESSED LIKE THAT?

26:40.599 --> 26:44.003
(chuckles) HONEY, I THINK
HE'S MESSING WITH YOU.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.735
(chuckles)

26:54.313 --> 26:55.985
I HOPE YOU HAD
A GOOD LAUGH.

26:55.985 --> 26:58.147
BE THANKFUL I SHOVED THAT
ON YOUR HEAD.

26:58.147 --> 26:59.849
THERE WAS ANOTHER OPTION.

27:05.254 --> 27:06.726
RENEE, STOP.

27:06.726 --> 27:09.959
WHY? SO YOU CAN
MOCK ME SOME MORE?

27:09.959 --> 27:11.260
I WASN'T MOCKING YOU.

27:12.862 --> 27:14.934
OKAY, BUT I MEAN,
YOU DID KINDA DESERVE IT--

27:14.934 --> 27:18.908
I MEAN, YOUR WHOLE
"I HEART OLD PEOPLE" THING.

27:18.908 --> 27:21.671
I WAS TRYING TO FIND
SOMETHING WE HAD IN COMMON,

27:21.671 --> 27:24.373
AND NOW I KNOW WE HAVE
NOTHING IN COMMON.

27:24.373 --> 27:27.016
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON
WHO DOES THINGS LIKE THIS,

27:27.016 --> 27:30.319
AND... I'M ME.

27:30.319 --> 27:31.981
YOU'RE NOT A GOOD PERSON?

27:31.981 --> 27:34.083
NO, BEN, I'M NOT.

27:34.083 --> 27:38.227
BECAUSE TRUTHFULLY,
DOING CHARITY MAKES ME NAUSEOUS.

27:38.227 --> 27:39.729
YEAH, ME, TOO.

27:39.729 --> 27:40.890
WHAT?

27:40.890 --> 27:44.734
MAKES MEUNCOMFORTABLE, TOO,
BUT I KNOW WHY THAT IS.

27:44.734 --> 27:46.165
DO YOU?

27:46.165 --> 27:48.738
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS.

27:48.738 --> 27:51.901
WHY? YOU AFRAID OF SAYING
SOMETHING TRUTHFUL?

27:55.404 --> 27:59.078
WHEN MY MOM... DIED,

27:59.078 --> 28:02.411
I WAS BOUNCED AROUND
FROM RELATIVE TO RELATIVE,

28:02.411 --> 28:03.953
MOST OF THEM DIRT-POOR.

28:03.953 --> 28:07.917
WE WERE ON THE RECEIVING END
OF A LOT OF CHARITY.

28:07.917 --> 28:10.159
I SPENT PLENTY OF TIME
IN PLACES LIKE THIS.

28:12.021 --> 28:13.793
AND I HATED IT.

28:13.793 --> 28:15.194
THEY HAND YOU SOMETHING--

28:15.194 --> 28:18.467
A, UH, A DENTED CAN OF FOOD
OR AN UGLY SHIRT.

28:18.467 --> 28:21.470
AND SOMEONE TELLS YOU, "SAY
'THANK YOU' TO THE NICE LADY."

28:21.470 --> 28:26.375
AND YOU DO, BUT SECRETLY,
YOU WANNA SCREAM, "I HATE YOU."

28:28.237 --> 28:32.141
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO CLAW
YOUR WAY OUT OF SOMETHING.

28:32.141 --> 28:34.984
LOOK AT US...

28:37.446 --> 28:41.821
HAVING THINGS IN COMMON.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.200
(scratching sound)

28:51.200 --> 28:52.862
(exhales deeply)

28:54.403 --> 28:57.807
(siren blares)

28:57.807 --> 29:00.840
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

29:04.043 --> 29:05.414
IS THERE A PROBLEM,
OFFICER?

29:05.414 --> 29:07.376
YEAH. YOU'RE PARKED
IN A FIRE ZONE.

29:07.376 --> 29:12.121
OH! DARN THE LUCK, I AM.

29:12.121 --> 29:13.953
WELL, SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEBODY'S GONNA BE SLAPPED

29:13.953 --> 29:15.985
WITH A PRETTY STEEP FINE.

29:15.985 --> 29:17.827
YEAH, I SHOULD WRITE YOU
A TICKET.

29:17.827 --> 29:19.058
MM.

29:19.058 --> 29:21.760
BUT IF YOU PROMISE
NOT TO DO IT AGAIN,

29:21.760 --> 29:23.362
I'LL LET YOU OFF
WITH A WARNING.

29:23.362 --> 29:25.835
WHAT?
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

29:25.835 --> 29:28.938
'CAUSE I'M A NEW DAD.
 OH, JEEZ.

29:28.938 --> 29:32.141
ABIGAIL DOROTHY BROVKA,
8 POUNDS, 6 OUNCES.

29:32.141 --> 29:33.903
I'M JUST SO HAPPY,

29:33.903 --> 29:35.074
FILLED WITH LOVE.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.876
ANYTHING SHORT
OF A TRIPLE MURDER,

29:36.876 --> 29:38.978
AND I'M PRETTY MUCH
LOOKING THE OTHER WAY.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.550
NO, NO. NO, DON'T LOOK
THE OTHER WAY.

29:41.550 --> 29:44.113
NO, LOOKTHISWAY.

29:44.113 --> 29:46.485
LAWS HAVE BEEN BROKEN.
THERE MUST BE CONSEQUENCES.

29:46.485 --> 29:48.057
I JUST WANNA GET HOME
TO MY BABY.

29:48.057 --> 29:50.419
I MEAN, LOOK AT HER,
ALL WRAPPED UP

29:50.419 --> 29:52.391
LIKE THE TASTIEST LITTLE BURRITO
IN FAIRVIEW.

29:52.391 --> 29:54.463
OH, LOOK AT THAT.
 YEAH.

29:54.463 --> 29:56.165
AH, WELL...

29:56.165 --> 29:58.097
(mutters)

29:58.097 --> 30:00.129
THAT WAS NOT COOL.

30:00.129 --> 30:03.402
NOW FORTUNATELY FOR YOU,
I ALWAYS CARRY A BACKUP.

30:03.402 --> 30:04.904
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

30:04.904 --> 30:07.036
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO
TO GET ARRESTED HERE?

30:07.036 --> 30:09.578
LADY, PEOPLE LIKE YOU
USED TO DRIVE ME NUTS.

30:09.578 --> 30:12.141
BUT NOTHING CAN FAZE ME NOW
THAT THIS SWEET LITTLE GIRL'S

30:12.141 --> 30:13.342
COME INTO MY LIFE.

30:13.342 --> 30:17.947
WELL, THAT SWEET LITTLE GIRL--
SHE'S GOTDUMBOEARS.

30:17.947 --> 30:19.188
(thud)

30:20.489 --> 30:21.951
UHH!

30:21.951 --> 30:23.122
MA'AM, YOU CAN TURN AROUND

30:23.122 --> 30:25.454
AND PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

30:25.454 --> 30:27.526
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.
 (handcuffs clicking)

30:27.526 --> 30:30.059
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN
AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU

30:30.059 --> 30:32.031
IN A COURT OF LAW.
 (exhales deeply)

30:32.031 --> 30:34.833
HEY, MIKE.

30:34.833 --> 30:38.037
UM, I, UH, I'VE GOT
A BIT OF A PROBLEM.

30:38.037 --> 30:40.209
MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME OUT
WITH IT.

30:40.209 --> 30:42.611
I CAN TRY.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

30:42.611 --> 30:44.173
YOU.

30:46.075 --> 30:49.618
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO HIRE YOU
WHEN I CAN'T GET YOU BONDED?

30:49.618 --> 30:53.152
WHO KNEW? MIKE DELFINO,
SUBURBAN DAD,

30:53.152 --> 30:57.186
GUY WHO KEEPS THE NEATEST LAWN
ON THE BLOCK,

30:57.186 --> 30:58.888
EX CON?

30:58.888 --> 31:00.890
(sighs) YEP.

31:00.890 --> 31:03.232
AND YOU WERE GONNA
MENTION THIS WHEN?

31:03.232 --> 31:05.864
LOOK, I'M SORRY. IT'S NOT
SOMETHING I TEND TO LEAD WITH

31:05.864 --> 31:07.136
WHEN I MEET SOMEBODY.

31:07.136 --> 31:09.468
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT THAT GUY
ANYMORE.

31:09.468 --> 31:11.100
THAT'S RIGHT.

31:11.100 --> 31:15.244
A BAD COP TRIED TO RAPE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND,

31:15.244 --> 31:18.077
AND YOU FOUGHT HIM
TO PROTECT HER.

31:18.077 --> 31:21.380
TELL ME WHY YOU WOULDN'T
WANNA BE THAT GUY ANYMORE.

31:21.380 --> 31:24.253
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
I WAS A KID,

31:24.253 --> 31:27.486
AND I'VE LEARNED LIFE'S A LOT
MORE COMPLICATED THAN I THOUGHT.

31:27.486 --> 31:29.488
NAH. NAH.

31:29.488 --> 31:32.621
LIFE IS BRUTALLY SIMPLE.

31:32.621 --> 31:37.566
LIFE IS GETTING WHAT YOU WANT
AND PROTECTING WHO YOU LOVE...

31:37.566 --> 31:39.398
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
IS WEAKNESS.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.300
A GUY LIKE YOU...

31:41.300 --> 31:44.173
GUY LIKE YOU KNOWS IT.

31:45.674 --> 31:47.376
BEN, IF THIS IS ALL JUST
TO TELL ME YOU CAN'T USE ME,

31:47.376 --> 31:48.437
I UNDERSTAND.

31:48.437 --> 31:50.109
NO, NO, NO, NO,
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

31:50.109 --> 31:52.381
I SAID I COULDN'TBONDYOU.

31:52.381 --> 31:54.313
(sighs)

31:54.313 --> 31:56.685
I CAN DEFINITELY USE YOU.

31:58.647 --> 32:01.150
I HOPE YOU'VE COOLED OFF
A BIT.

32:01.150 --> 32:05.024
YEAH. WELL, UH, SPENDING
A FEW HOURS IN A CELL

32:05.024 --> 32:09.328
WITH A DRUNK TRANSVESTITE
WILL DO THAT TO YOU. (chuckles)

32:09.328 --> 32:13.032
YOUR BABY'S CUTE,
BY THE WAY.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.964
I SWEAR SHE'LL GROW
INTO THOSE EARS.

32:14.964 --> 32:18.607
THANKS. THE GUY YOU CALLED
TO PICK YOU UP IS HERE.

32:18.607 --> 32:20.939
(sighs)

32:20.939 --> 32:24.243
(telephone ringing in distance)

32:26.115 --> 32:28.217
CARLOS, THANKS FOR COMING.

32:28.217 --> 32:30.179
I COULDN'T CALL MIKE,
AND, UH,

32:30.179 --> 32:31.550
I DIDN'T WANNA UPSET
THE GIRLS, SO...

32:31.550 --> 32:32.951
YOU OKAY?

32:32.951 --> 32:36.055
THEY TOLD ME YOU ASSAULTED
A MOTORCYCLE COP.

32:36.055 --> 32:40.359
(sighs) ACTUALLY,
IT WAS JUST A MOTORCYCLE.

32:40.359 --> 32:42.531
THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE YOU.

32:42.531 --> 32:45.734
I'VE BEEN...

32:45.734 --> 32:49.198
IN THIS WEIRD PLACE LATELY.

32:50.169 --> 32:54.273
I KEEP DOING THINGS,
HOPING TO GET CAUGHT.

32:54.273 --> 32:56.205
DOES IT HELP?

32:56.205 --> 32:58.447
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

33:00.179 --> 33:02.711
AND THEN I JUST
FEEL GUILTY AGAIN.

33:06.255 --> 33:10.489
(whispers) I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW TO PULL MYSELF OUT OF THIS.

33:10.489 --> 33:11.990
(lowered voice) I GET IT.

33:11.990 --> 33:16.465
GABY KEEPS PUSHING ME TO ACT
LIKE EVERYTHING IS NORMAL.

33:16.465 --> 33:18.997
I GUESS WE'RE JUST SUPPOSED
TO STUFF EVERYTHING DOWN

33:18.997 --> 33:20.369
AND MOVE ON.

33:20.369 --> 33:22.071
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

33:22.071 --> 33:25.304
THE GIRLS ARE PLAYING POKER

33:25.304 --> 33:29.578
AND ACTING LIKE THINGS ARE FINE,
AND THEY'RE NOT.

33:32.311 --> 33:33.312
(sighs)

33:39.288 --> 33:41.320
IT IS NICE TO BE ABLE
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.352
OHH.

33:43.352 --> 33:45.394
IT IS.

33:47.796 --> 33:49.458
DO YOU WANNA GET
SOME COFFEE?

33:52.661 --> 33:54.363
SOUNDS GOOD.

34:05.114 --> 34:09.118
(beeping)

34:09.118 --> 34:11.750
(ringing,
indistinct conversations)

34:11.750 --> 34:13.581
PARKER, IT'S ME.

34:13.581 --> 34:16.255
IT'S GETTING LATE.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

34:16.255 --> 34:19.158
EVERYTHING IS FINE, M'LADY.

34:19.158 --> 34:20.589
WHO'S THIS?

34:20.589 --> 34:21.830
Toph.

34:21.830 --> 34:24.433
IF THIS IS A BOOTY CALL,
TOPH IS READY TO FILL IN.

34:24.433 --> 34:27.436
WHERE IS PARKER?

34:27.436 --> 34:28.837
I don't know, man.

34:28.837 --> 34:30.139
IT'S KIND OF

34:30.139 --> 34:32.841
A "LORD OF THE FLIES"
SITUATION HERE.

34:32.841 --> 34:36.304
SO... ARE WE HOOKING UP OR WHAT?

34:36.304 --> 34:37.306
OH!

34:37.306 --> 34:38.447
(beep)

34:38.447 --> 34:40.149
♪♪♪

34:40.149 --> 34:41.250
PARKER!

34:41.250 --> 34:44.081
PARKER!

34:44.081 --> 34:46.355
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.
I'M LOOKING FOR MY SON,

34:46.355 --> 34:48.357
PARKER SCAVO--
I'M HOPING YOU KNOW HIM.

34:48.357 --> 34:51.389
(crowd chanting) KEG STAND!
KEG STAND! KEG STAND! KEG STAND!

34:51.389 --> 34:54.263
AND NOW I'M HOPING YOU DON'T.

34:54.263 --> 34:57.226
KEG STAND! KEG STAND! KEG STAND!
KEG STAND! KEG STAND! KEG STAND!

34:57.226 --> 34:59.298
WHOA, HOLD ON.
THIS IS A PRIVATE PARTY.

34:59.298 --> 35:00.769
UH, I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

35:00.769 --> 35:02.571
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WHAT ARE YOU,
SOME KIND OF NARC?

35:02.571 --> 35:06.175
NO, I'M JUST LOOKING FOR MY SON,
I SWEAR. I'M NOT A NARC.

35:06.175 --> 35:08.337
EXACTLY WHAT A NARC
WOULD SAY.

35:08.337 --> 35:09.478
STEP ASIDE, KID.

35:09.478 --> 35:11.740
LADY, I SAID NO.

35:11.740 --> 35:15.184
LISTEN TO ME.
MY SON IS HERE SOMEWHERE,

35:15.184 --> 35:17.346
AND HE IS PROBABLY DRUNK
AND PROBABLY TERRIFIED,

35:17.346 --> 35:19.248
AND I HAVE GOT TO FIND HIM.

35:19.248 --> 35:22.351
SORRY. THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE
LETTING A NARC INTO OUR PARTY.

35:22.351 --> 35:26.325
I AM NOT... UGH! (grunts)

35:26.325 --> 35:28.697
(indistinct conversations)

35:28.697 --> 35:29.898
OKAY.

35:29.898 --> 35:31.700
WOULD ANARCDO THIS?

35:33.662 --> 35:36.335
LEGS!

35:36.335 --> 35:37.636
(crowd chanting) KEG STAND!

35:37.636 --> 35:42.441
KEG STAND! KEG STAND! KEG STAND!
KEG STAND! KEG STAND!

35:42.441 --> 35:44.313
(Tom) LYNETTE?

35:44.313 --> 35:45.374
UH... TOM!

35:45.374 --> 35:47.716
(crowd) KEG STAND!

35:47.716 --> 35:49.848
THIS ISN'T WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.
I HAVEN'T BEEN DRINKING.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.850
(belches)

35:51.850 --> 35:54.823
I MEAN, A LITTLE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

35:54.823 --> 35:58.527
PARKER CALLED ME TO PICK HIM UP
BECAUSE HE DRANK TOO MUCH.
 WHERE IS HE?

35:58.527 --> 36:00.889
HE'S IN THE CAR. HE SENT ME BACK
BECAUSE HE LOST HIS PHONE.

36:00.889 --> 36:04.533
IS HE OKAY?
 HE'S COVERED IN PUKE,
WHICH I'M HOPING IS--IS HIS.

36:04.533 --> 36:06.295
OH, GOD.

36:06.295 --> 36:09.568
THIS IS YOUR FAULT
FOR LETTING HIM COME HERE.

36:09.568 --> 36:11.870
MYFAULT?
 YOUCOULD HAVE STOPPED HIM.

36:11.870 --> 36:14.443
OH, PLEASE. YOU KNEW
IT WAS A BAD IDEA.

36:14.443 --> 36:16.375
YOU WERE JUST TOO BUSY
TESTING ME.

36:16.375 --> 36:20.209
NO, I WAS GIVING YOU A CHANCE
TO STAND UP AND BE A FATHER.

36:20.209 --> 36:21.510
NOW WE'VE GOT
A 16-YEAR-OLD SON

36:21.510 --> 36:22.911
WE HAVE TO CLEAN OFF
WITH A GARDEN HOSE.

36:22.911 --> 36:25.854
I GUESS YOU SHOWED ME.

36:25.854 --> 36:28.817
(scoffs)

36:32.561 --> 36:34.263
HE ASLEEP?

36:34.263 --> 36:36.795
YEAH. I THOUGHT

36:36.795 --> 36:40.829
LET HIM SOBER UP
BEFORE WE PUNISH HIM.

36:40.829 --> 36:43.372
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T
HAVE LET HIM GO TONIGHT.

36:44.833 --> 36:50.739
BUT RIGHT NOW SAYING "YES"
IS THE ONLY MOVE I'VE GOT.

36:50.739 --> 36:52.381
"MOVE"?

36:52.381 --> 36:54.283
WHAT IS THIS?

36:54.283 --> 36:56.345
SOME KIND OF GAME
YOU'RE TRYING TO WIN?

36:56.345 --> 37:01.390
LYNETTE, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THIS IS LIKE FOR ME.

37:01.390 --> 37:04.493
FOR 20 YEARS, I HAD
THE SAME BEDTIME RITUAL.

37:04.493 --> 37:08.226
I-I BRUSHED MY TEETH, AND I'D
GO LOOK AT EACH KID SLEEPING,

37:08.226 --> 37:11.960
AND NO MATTER WHAT CRAP
HAPPENED DURING THE DAY,

37:11.960 --> 37:15.534
I KNEW THE THINGS
THAT MATTERED WERE OKAY.

37:15.534 --> 37:17.966
NOW MY RITUAL...

37:17.966 --> 37:19.938
I BRUSH MY TEETH.

37:19.938 --> 37:22.971
SO, YES.

37:22.971 --> 37:24.613
I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN
TO MAKE THE LITTLE TIME

37:24.613 --> 37:27.546
THAT I SPEND WITH THEM
THE BEST PART OF THEIR WEEK.

37:27.546 --> 37:29.518
WOW. YOU'RE SUCCEEDING.

37:29.518 --> 37:32.421
WHEN I SEE THEM
SPRINT OUT TO THE CAR,

37:32.421 --> 37:34.723
SO EXCITED TO SEE DADDY,

37:34.723 --> 37:36.855
PART OF ME THINKS, GREAT.

37:36.855 --> 37:40.429
THEY'RE OKAY WITH THIS,
AND PART OF ME THINKS...

37:42.631 --> 37:45.263
OH, CRAP.

37:45.263 --> 37:48.537
I'M LOSING THEM TO YOU.

37:48.537 --> 37:50.969
SO YOU'RE TRYING
TO WIN, TOO.

37:50.969 --> 37:52.501
NO.

37:57.806 --> 38:00.309
I JUST...

38:00.309 --> 38:03.011
I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.986
AND THE ONLY WAY
WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS

38:07.986 --> 38:11.790
IS IF WE STOP WORRYING
ABOUT...

38:13.922 --> 38:15.794
WHO WINS.

38:24.633 --> 38:26.004
I'M SORRY TO BURDEN YOU
WITH THIS,

38:26.004 --> 38:28.877
BUT I JUST COULDN'T KEEP IT
TO MYSELF ANYMORE.

38:28.877 --> 38:31.039
WHY NOT?
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO TELLME?

38:31.039 --> 38:33.342
REPRESSION IS, LIKE,
YOUR THING.

38:33.342 --> 38:35.884
OKAY, LET'S--LET'S SAY
SOMEONE KNOWS.

38:35.884 --> 38:37.315
THEY'RE NOT ASKING US
FOR MONEY.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.388
THEY'RE NOT TRYING
TO BLACKMAIL US.

38:39.388 --> 38:40.619
I SAY UNTIL THEY TELL US
WHAT THEY WANT,

38:40.619 --> 38:43.392
WE JUST ACT LIKE
EVERYTHING'S NORMAL.

38:43.392 --> 38:45.954
EXCEPT I'M DRINKING
A LOT MORE.

38:45.954 --> 38:48.497
YOU DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD TELL THE OTHERS?

38:48.497 --> 38:50.328
WELL, WE CAN'T TELL SUSAN.
SHE'S ALREADY FLIPPING OUT.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.100
YOU'RE RIGHT.
AND WE SHOULDN'T TELL LYNETTE,

38:52.100 --> 38:53.462
GIVEN WHAT'S GOING ON
IN HER MARRIAGE.

38:53.462 --> 38:55.604
OR CARLOS, GIVEN WHAT'S
GOING ON IN MINE.

38:57.736 --> 38:59.838
SO YOU DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD DOANYTHING?

38:59.838 --> 39:02.040
(glass clatters)

39:02.040 --> 39:03.572
WELL, THERE IS ONE THING
I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU

39:03.572 --> 39:06.445
YOUNEED TO DO.
GET RID OF CHUCK!

39:06.445 --> 39:08.817
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I SHOULD, BUT, UM--

39:08.817 --> 39:09.978
BUT WHAT?

39:09.978 --> 39:12.120
THIS IS GONNA SOUND STRANGE.

39:12.120 --> 39:16.084
HE MAKES ME FEEL SAFE.

39:16.084 --> 39:18.356
SAFE? YEAH, I DO THINK
THAT'S STRANGE,

39:18.356 --> 39:20.459
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT
SOME LUNATIC KNOWS.

39:20.459 --> 39:23.632
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO END THIS,
AND YOU'VE GOT TO END IT NOW.

39:26.134 --> 39:28.366
CHUCK?

39:32.871 --> 39:35.043
NOW ISN'T THAT FUNNY?

39:35.043 --> 39:36.975
I WASJUSTTHINKING
TO MYSELF,

39:36.975 --> 39:39.948
"HOW AM I GONNA WASH MY BACK
IN THE SHOWER?"

39:39.948 --> 39:41.480
AND THEN YOU WALK IN.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.881
SERENDIPITY, HUH?

39:44.413 --> 39:47.986
SORRY. I'M GONNA PASS.

39:47.986 --> 39:50.919
OKAY.

39:52.791 --> 39:55.393
IS, UM...

39:55.393 --> 39:56.695
SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND?

39:56.695 --> 40:00.028
IT CAN WAIT.

40:00.028 --> 40:01.500
BREE...
 GO AHEAD.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.572
TAKE YOUR SHOWER.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.136
(sighs)

40:10.979 --> 40:13.982
(shower running)

40:23.121 --> 40:29.197
(telephone rings)

40:29.197 --> 40:30.999
(ring)

40:30.999 --> 40:32.130
(beep)

40:32.130 --> 40:33.662
(exhales deeply) HELLO?

40:33.662 --> 40:35.033
(woman)
I have a collect call

40:35.033 --> 40:36.765
from Fairview Correctional
Institution.

40:36.765 --> 40:38.937
Will you accept
the charges?

40:38.937 --> 40:41.670
YES.

40:41.670 --> 40:44.473
(Paul)
Bree, it's Paul Young.

40:44.473 --> 40:46.214
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU ASKED ME--

40:46.214 --> 40:49.578
you know, who might have known
about Mary Alice's note.

40:49.578 --> 40:50.819
YEAH?

40:50.819 --> 40:53.482
WHEN I CONFESSED TO THE MURDER
OF MARTHA HUBER,

40:53.482 --> 40:55.053
I MENTIONED THE LETTER
TO THE POLICE.

40:58.527 --> 41:00.559
WELL, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHO THESE POLICEMEN WERE?

41:00.559 --> 41:02.491
The main detective
was a tall guy

41:02.491 --> 41:05.463
WITH A SHORT NAME LIKE,
UH, PENCE OR VINCE.

41:05.463 --> 41:09.538
WAS IT VANCE? CHUCK VANCE?

41:09.538 --> 41:11.540
YES, THAT'S IT.

41:11.540 --> 41:12.971
I HAVE TO GO.

41:12.971 --> 41:15.173
(beep, receiver clatters)

41:16.845 --> 41:18.647
(shower turns off)

41:20.709 --> 41:21.950
(wallet thuds)

41:23.251 --> 41:25.884
OKAY. I KNOW THAT WAS
THE SHORTEST SHOWER

41:25.884 --> 41:28.687
I'VE EVER TAKEN, BUT I...
(sighs)

41:28.687 --> 41:30.589
I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THE LOOK
ON YOUR FACE BEFORE.

41:30.589 --> 41:33.562
BE HONEST WITH ME, BREE.

41:33.562 --> 41:35.664
ARE YOU ABOUT
TO BREAK UP WITH ME?

41:38.797 --> 41:42.671
(sighs) OF COURSE NOT.

41:44.202 --> 41:48.577
IN FACT, LET'S GET YOU BACK
IN THAT SHOWER. (giggles)

41:51.610 --> 41:55.714
YES, IN THE DIVIDED WORLD
OF THE SUBURBS,

41:55.714 --> 42:00.088
EVERYONE IS LOOKING FOR
SOME WAY TO MAKE A CONNECTION.

42:01.790 --> 42:06.294
SOME SEEK TO CONNECT BY
FOCUSING ON A GREATER GOOD...

42:08.957 --> 42:13.231
SOME BY REVEALING
A COMMON HISTORY...

42:16.034 --> 42:21.940
SOME BY SHARING A PAIN
NO ONE ELSE CAN HEAL.

42:24.242 --> 42:25.974
THEN THERE ARE THOSE

42:25.974 --> 42:29.177
WHO ONCE SOUGHT
TO MAKE A CONNECTION...

42:31.119 --> 42:36.554
THAT THEY NOW WANT DESPERATELY
TO ESCAPE.
