WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:07.075
WHAT ARE
YOU KIDS DOIN'?

00:07.108 --> 00:08.242
OH, WE'RE
BUILDING A FORT.

00:08.276 --> 00:10.311
EVER BUILD A FORT,
GRANDPA?

00:10.344 --> 00:11.112
ABSOLUTELY.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.081
WE USED TO PLAY
COWBOYS AND INDIANS.

00:13.114 --> 00:17.218
UH, THAT'S WHEN
YOU WERE ALLOWED
TO SAY "INDIANS."

00:17.251 --> 00:19.653
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO SAY "INDIANS"
ANYMORE.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.590
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO SAY "BITE ME."

00:23.124 --> 00:24.492
WATCH YOUR MOUTH.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.594
BITE ME, INDIAN.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.163
HEY, WATCH YOUR MOUTH.

00:31.199 --> 00:34.068
HEY, ARE YOU OK?
WHERE'S LILY?

00:34.102 --> 00:35.303
WE FOUND THE PLACE.
NO LILY.

00:35.336 --> 00:37.238
YEAH, BUT THE GUY
WHO RUNS THE PLACE,

00:37.271 --> 00:38.339
HE'S GONNA REMEMBER
THE FINNERTYS...

00:38.372 --> 00:41.275
EVERY TIME HE LOOKS
UP TO THE WALL
AND SEES THE SPOT

00:41.309 --> 00:44.645
WHERE DANNY AIELLO
USED TO BE.

00:44.678 --> 00:47.115
YOU STOLE A PHOTO
OF DANNY AIELLO?

00:47.148 --> 00:49.183
IT'S A SIGNED PHOTO
OF DANNY AIELLO.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.285
I LOVE THIS GUY.

00:51.819 --> 00:52.520
SO NO LILY.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.189
THAT GIRL IS
IN SO MUCH TROUBLE.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.725
SHE HAS STEPPED
OVER THE LINE THIS TIME.

00:57.758 --> 00:58.592
I'M FURIOUS.

00:58.626 --> 01:01.129
I'M BEYOND FURIOUS.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.431
HEY, EVERYBODY.
HEY, DAD.

01:03.464 --> 01:04.332
HOW YA DOIN'?

01:04.365 --> 01:07.101
HEY, YOU LOOK CUTE.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.537
SHE IS IN
SO MUCH TROUBLE.

01:09.570 --> 01:13.107
I JUST WISH
WE COULD TELL HER.

01:27.488 --> 01:28.422
ALL RIGHT, WE REALLY
NEED TO DO SOMETHING,

01:28.456 --> 01:30.191
BECAUSE AFTER
WHAT SHE'S DONE...

01:30.224 --> 01:31.459
WHAT'S LILY DONE?

01:31.492 --> 01:32.426
WE DON'T KNOW,

01:32.460 --> 01:34.595
BUT SHE'S
DEFINITELY GONE
TOO FAR THIS TIME.

01:34.628 --> 01:35.629
DEFINITELY.

01:35.663 --> 01:36.697
PROBABLY.

01:36.730 --> 01:37.598
ALMOST CERTAINLY.

01:37.631 --> 01:38.699
IF WE WANT
TO FIND OUT...

01:38.732 --> 01:40.734
WE'RE JUST
GONNA HAVE TO
CONFRONT HER.

01:40.768 --> 01:41.469
SO CONFRONT HER.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.371
DAD, WE CAN'T
CONFRONT HER.

01:43.404 --> 01:47.541
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE ALL SCARED
OF A TEENAGE GIRL.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.743
LOOK, DAD, YOU JUST
HAD TO DEAL WITH BOYS.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.712
YOU'VE NEVER HAD TO DEAL
WITH A TEENAGE GIRL.

01:51.745 --> 01:52.713
THEY ARE TERRIFYING.

01:52.746 --> 01:56.817
THEY HAVE
2 SETTINGS--RAGE
AND SCREAMING RAGE.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.353
I KNOW SHE'S
UP TO SOMETHIN'.

01:59.387 --> 02:00.654
BUT WHAT GOOD
DOES IT DO YA?

02:00.688 --> 02:02.390
YOU'VE GOT NO EVIDENCE.

02:02.423 --> 02:05.726
NOTHIN' YOU CAN USE,
ANYWAY.

02:05.759 --> 02:08.396
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT?

02:08.429 --> 02:10.598
OK, IT WAS A GOOD FAITH
SEARCH FOR A STAMP.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.866
HEY, ED, YOU KNOW
WHERE ANY STAMPS ARE?

02:12.900 --> 02:13.701
I DON'T LIVE HERE.

02:13.734 --> 02:14.735
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I JUST GET CONFUSED,

02:14.768 --> 02:17.471
'CAUSE YOU'RE
ALWAYS ON MY COUCH
EATING MY FOOD.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.840
IT'S AN
UNDERSTANDABLE
MISTAKE.

02:19.873 --> 02:20.508
LILY!

02:20.541 --> 02:23.444
LIL, DO YOU
HAVE ANY STAMPS?

02:25.379 --> 02:26.680
LILY?

02:51.372 --> 02:53.241
HMM, STAMPS.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.682
SEPTEMBER 12, 1979?

03:03.384 --> 03:04.252
FAKE I.D.?

03:04.285 --> 03:05.786
THE TEENAGER
WE KNOW AS LILY

03:05.819 --> 03:10.258
IS ALSO
A 21-YEAR-OLD NAMED
LILLIAN WINTERHAVEN.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.794
AN HEIRESS, NO DOUBT.

03:13.827 --> 03:14.895
SO WHAT'S SHE GONNA
DO WITH THIS CARD?

03:14.928 --> 03:17.865
WE DON'T KNOW, BUT NONE OF
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE GOOD.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.401
SO WHAT THE HELL'S
SHE DOIN' WITH
A FAKE I.D. ANYWAYS?

03:20.434 --> 03:22.670
MAYBE SHE WANTS TO GO
TO "R" RATED MOVIES.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.672
WE TAKE HER
TO "R" RATED
MOVIES ANYWAY.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.973
BESIDES, YOU
ONLY HAVE TO BE 17

03:26.006 --> 03:27.641
TO GET INTO
AN "R" RATED MOVIE.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.009
MISS WINTERHAVEN IS 21.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.511
OK, JUST RELAX,
SEAN.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.512
WE HAD
FAKE I.D.s, TOO.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.648
YEAH, AND DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT WE DID WITH THEM?

03:37.017 --> 03:39.820
WHOO! LAW SCHOOL
IS A BITCH.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.256
WHOO. SURE IS.

03:42.290 --> 03:45.626
HEY, SO, UH,
WHAT DO WE NEED?

03:45.659 --> 03:48.762
UH...UGH.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.564
UH...DO WE
NEED BEER?

03:50.598 --> 03:51.599
BEER? UH...

03:51.632 --> 03:53.601
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST GET SOME IN CASE.

03:53.634 --> 03:56.370
BETTER SAFE
THAN SORRY.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.740
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL
TAKE THIS AND,
UH...

03:59.773 --> 04:01.542
THOSE CONDOMS
RIGHT THERE.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.843
YOU GOT I.D.?

04:02.876 --> 04:05.379
HA HA HA HA!

04:05.413 --> 04:06.113
HEE HEE HEE!

04:06.146 --> 04:06.980
WHOO, MAN, IT'S
BEEN A LONG TIME

04:07.014 --> 04:08.782
SINCE SOMEONE
ASKED ME
FOR THAT, YEAH.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.918
THAT IS VERY
FLATTERING.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.821
ALL RIGHT, MR. COUSTEAU.

04:13.854 --> 04:17.358
THAT'LL BE $26.32.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.528
20--

04:22.095 --> 04:25.399
YOU KNOW, WE'LL
JUST TAKE THE BEER.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.669
WHERE'D YOU FIND
THE I.D., ANYWAY?

04:28.702 --> 04:30.471
IN HER ROOM.

04:30.504 --> 04:31.204
WHAT?

04:31.238 --> 04:33.006
YEAH, IT WAS
IN HER DESK DRAWER.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.442
OHH.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.843
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!

04:35.876 --> 04:37.611
THIS IS
NOT GOOD.

04:37.645 --> 04:40.047
I'M NOT FOLLOWIN'
THE BIG CONTROVERSY.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.983
HE TOOK THE I.D.
OUT OF HER ROOM.

04:43.016 --> 04:43.551
YEAH?

04:43.584 --> 04:46.487
IT'S TAINTED
EVIDENCE.

04:46.754 --> 04:49.757
A PARENT CANNOT
GO INTO A TEENAGE
GIRL'S BEDROOM,

04:49.790 --> 04:51.425
CANNOT GO
THROUGH HER STUFF.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.893
ANYTHING HE FINDS
IS INADMISSIBLE.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.728
NOTHIN'
IS INADMISSIBLE.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.597
JUST SHOVE IT
IN HER FACE.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.798
HO HO!

04:57.831 --> 04:59.667
DAD, HAVE YOU EVER
HAD A CONFRONTATION
WITH A TEENAGE GIRL?

04:59.700 --> 05:01.802
IT'S LIKE BEING LOCKED
IN THE TRUNK OF A CAR

05:01.835 --> 05:03.504
WITH A WOLVERINE.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.440
THEY'RE EMOTIONAL
POWDER KEGS,

05:06.474 --> 05:07.908
AND BY GOING
INTO HER BEDROOM,

05:07.941 --> 05:09.109
WE LIT THE MATCH.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.110
HEADS UP.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.079
OH, YEAH.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.647
I DON'T GET IT.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.849
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL
ABOUT GOIN' INTO
LILY'S ROOM?

05:15.883 --> 05:20.654
OH, GRANDPA, DON'T
GO INTO LILY'S ROOM.

05:20.688 --> 05:23.090
YOU WILL REGRET IT.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.603
WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO COME IN MY ROOM?

05:35.636 --> 05:37.838
I'M SLEEPWALKING.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.973
IT'S DANGEROUS
TO WAKE ME UP.

05:40.007 --> 05:43.877
OH. WELL, WHEN YOU WAKE UP,
REMEMBER THIS--

05:43.911 --> 05:47.381
I'M IN NINTH GRADE.
THEY TEACH US CHEMISTRY.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.683
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU LEARN
IN CHEMISTRY?

05:49.717 --> 05:51.519
HOW TO MAKE POISON,

05:51.552 --> 05:53.153
UNDETECTABLE POISON.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.956
I COULD'VE COVERED
THE DOORKNOB IN IT TODAY.

05:55.989 --> 05:59.927
BUT TOUCHED
THE DOORKNOB.

05:59.960 --> 06:03.531
IT ONLY WORKS
ON LITTLE BOYS.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.872
THERE'S NO SUCH
POISON, HENRY.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.741
BESIDES, WHY WOULD
SHE GO TO SO MUCH TROUBLE

06:13.774 --> 06:16.777
WHEN SHE COULD JUST
SMOTHER YOU IN YOUR SLEEP?

06:18.011 --> 06:20.648
STOP IT.
YOU'RE SCARING HIM.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.784
I'M SAVING HIS LIFE.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.554
SO YOU ALL
LIVE IN FEAR
OF A LITTLE GIRL?

06:26.587 --> 06:28.856
WHO'S RUNNIN'
THIS HOUSE, ANYWAY?

06:28.889 --> 06:29.757
WE ARE, ALL RIGHT?

06:29.790 --> 06:33.026
AND IT'S NOT LIKE WE
DIDN'T CONFRONT HER...

06:33.060 --> 06:34.595
IN A WAY.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.632
OH, UH, HEY, LIL.
HEY.

06:38.666 --> 06:39.332
HEY, DAD.

06:39.366 --> 06:40.901
UH, WHAT ARE YOU
UP TO TONIGHT?

06:40.934 --> 06:43.170
NOTHING. GOING
TO CHRISTINA'S.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.773
OH, CHRISTINA.
YEAH, YEAH.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.841
SHE'S THE REAL
HEAVY DRINKER, RIGHT?

06:47.875 --> 06:48.542
NO.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.978
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S, UM...

06:51.011 --> 06:51.945
GOD, WHO IS THAT?

06:51.979 --> 06:54.147
THE REAL HEAVY DRINKER
IS, UM...

06:54.181 --> 06:55.449
NOBODY.

06:55.483 --> 06:56.283
OH, YEAH,
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:56.316 --> 06:58.051
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE REALLY SHOULD JUST--

06:58.085 --> 06:59.887
WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT THINGS MORE.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.054
YOU KNOW,
I WAS WATCHIN' THE TV,

07:01.088 --> 07:03.691
AND I SAW THAT AD
WITH FRASIER'S MAID,
AND SHE WAS LIKE,

07:03.724 --> 07:04.992
"TALK TO YOUR KIDS."

07:05.025 --> 07:06.627
HA HA HA.
YOU KNOW, MORE,

07:06.660 --> 07:08.996
AND, UH, YOU'RE
MY KID, AND...

07:09.029 --> 07:12.733
I'M JUST REALLY
INTERESTED IN YOUR LIFE.

07:12.766 --> 07:17.037
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT MY PERIOD?

07:18.772 --> 07:21.074
YEAH. BYE, DAD.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.915
OH, YOU'RE WORKIN'
WAY TOO HARD.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.850
YOU WANT TO GET THE TRUTH
OUT OF YOUR KID,

07:29.883 --> 07:31.585
YOU ASK HIM
DIRECT QUESTIONS,

07:31.619 --> 07:33.053
AND LOOK HIM
STRAIGHT IN THE EYE.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.087
IT DOESN'T WORK,
DAD.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.889
I'VE TRIED IT.
REALLY?

07:35.923 --> 07:37.658
DOESN'T WORK.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.829
OK, I HAVEN'T
TRIED IT.

07:41.862 --> 07:42.663
UH-HUH. HA HA HA.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.498
BUT IT WOULDN'T WORK
WITH LILY ANYWAY.

07:44.532 --> 07:45.298
I MEAN, SHE'S
A DIFFERENT BREED.

07:45.332 --> 07:47.167
SHE'S REMORSELESS.
SHE KNOWS NO FEAR.

07:47.200 --> 07:51.138
YEAH, WHAT
YOU CALL HELL,
SHE CALLS HOME.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.674
IT'S NOT ABOUT FEAR.
IT'S ABOUT RESPECT.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.509
WAIT. HOW'S SHE
GONNA RESPECT ME

07:55.543 --> 07:56.944
AFTER I VIOLATED
HER PRIVACY?

07:56.977 --> 07:58.011
SHE DOESN'T
HAVE PRIVACY.

07:58.045 --> 08:01.582
WHY WOULD A TEENAGER
WANT TO KEEP
SOMETHIN' PRIVATE?

08:01.615 --> 08:03.984
BECAUSE IT'S BAD.

08:04.017 --> 08:08.822
YOU BOYS WERE
NEVER ABLE TO KEEP
ANYTHING FROM ME.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.834
YOU DON'T WANT
TO CONFRONT HER?
I'LL DO IT.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.068
I'LL BE BACK
IN 5 MINUTES

08:55.102 --> 08:55.803
WITH THE INFORMATION
YOU NEED.

08:55.836 --> 08:56.804
DAD, DAD,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

08:56.837 --> 09:00.540
IT'S MY HOUSE,
THEY'RE MY KIDS,
I'M IN CONTROL.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.175
NONE SHALL PASS.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.712
WHOA, WHAT'S
GOIN' ON HERE?

09:04.745 --> 09:05.512
COOL FORT,
HUH, DAD?

09:05.545 --> 09:07.047
YEAH, AND YOU GUYS
CAN'T GET PAST US

09:07.080 --> 09:09.082
WITHOUT
THE SECRET PASSWORD.

09:09.116 --> 09:11.084
MMM,
LET ME GUESS.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.086
IT'S BOOBIES.

09:14.888 --> 09:18.091
I TOLD YOU WE NEEDED
A DIFFERENT PASSWORD.

09:18.125 --> 09:22.129
I JUST LIKE
THAT ONE SO MUCH.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.330
BOOBIES!

09:23.363 --> 09:25.032
WHOA, DAD,
HERE'S THE THING, OK?

09:25.065 --> 09:26.033
WE CONFRONT HER,

09:26.066 --> 09:28.736
THEN SHE'S GONNA FIND OUT
ABOUT THE OTHER THING.

09:28.769 --> 09:29.770
THERE'S ANOTHER THING?

09:29.803 --> 09:30.704
WE WERE SO DESPERATE

09:30.738 --> 09:31.639
TO SEE WHAT SHE WAS USIN'
THE FAKE I.D. FOR

09:31.672 --> 09:36.910
THAT WE DID SOMETHIN'
BORDERLINE UNETHICAL.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.346
WE KIND OF CHECKED
HER E-MAIL.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.049
OK, WHAT'S
HER PASSWORD?

09:42.082 --> 09:43.951
TRY BOOBIES.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.352
IT'S NOT
BOOBIES.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.320
IT'S
TIMBERLAKE.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.089
HOW DO
YOU KNOW?

09:49.122 --> 09:51.224
LOOK AROUND.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.230
AHEM!

09:57.264 --> 09:58.966
TIM-BER-LAKE.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.634
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
WORK, WORK, WORK.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.069
Computer:
WELCOME!

10:02.102 --> 10:02.703
I'M IN!

10:02.736 --> 10:04.004
Computer:
YOU'VE GOT MAIL.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.940
OK, THIS IS HER
PRIVATE EMAIL
ACCOUNT.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.108
I JUST WANT TO
GO ON RECORD

10:08.141 --> 10:10.177
AS SAYING
THIS IS WRONG.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.211
DO YOU WANT
ME TO STOP?

10:11.244 --> 10:13.146
I JUST WANT IT
ON THE RECORD.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.281
OK, DULY NOTED.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.883
LOOK AT THE SUBJECT
ON THIS ONE.

10:15.916 --> 10:18.051
"I WILL FREAK YOU
CRAZY, BABY."

10:18.085 --> 10:19.887
HEY, THEY'RE
RIPPING OFF MY LINE.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.188
Claudia:
COME ON,
OPEN IT!

10:21.221 --> 10:22.189
Jimmy:
CALM DOWN.

10:22.222 --> 10:22.990
IT'S JUST JUNK MAIL.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.692
OK, THERE'S GOTTA
BE SOMETHING HERE.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.727
THERE'S GOT TO BE
JUST SOME CLUE.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.229
WHAT--
HEY, WHAT'S THAT?

10:29.262 --> 10:30.898
UH, SOMEONE'S
INSTANT MESSAGING YOU.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.133
SOMEONE NAMED
"SWEETANDNASTEE."

10:33.166 --> 10:35.669
THEY THINK
YOU'RE LILY.

10:35.703 --> 10:37.270
AH, "LILY?"

10:37.838 --> 10:39.139
JUST SHUT IT DOWN!
SHUT IT DOWN!

10:39.172 --> 10:40.340
YOU GOTTA BAIL, MAN.
NO, NO, NO!

10:40.373 --> 10:43.310
THIS SWEETANDNASTEE
PERSON MIGHT BE ABLE
TO GIVE US A CLUE.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.683
YES...

10:51.719 --> 10:53.320
YOU KNOW...

10:55.255 --> 10:57.324
FRESH...

10:57.925 --> 10:58.692
KEEPING IT FRESH?

10:58.726 --> 10:59.960
YEAH, YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT ALL THE KIDS

10:59.993 --> 11:01.061
ARE SAYING THESE DAYS.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.029
NO, THEY'RE NOT.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.263
YEAH, THAT'S
OLD SCHOOL, MAN.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.298
NOW THE KIDS
ARE SAYING "SPANK."

11:05.332 --> 11:08.301
YOU KNOW, LIKE
"YO, THAT'S SPANK, MAN!"

11:08.335 --> 11:10.270
NO, WE'RE NOT.

11:10.738 --> 11:11.905
YOU WILL BE.

11:18.311 --> 11:19.813
NOW WE'RE LIKE TWINS?!

11:19.847 --> 11:22.482
LILY'S GOT A
TATTOO ON HER BUTT?

11:22.515 --> 11:26.219
HENRY, GO DOWNSTAIRS!
YEAH.

11:26.253 --> 11:27.354
HAVE WE EVER
CHECKED HER BUTT?

11:27.387 --> 11:28.989
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO CHECK HER BUTT?!

11:29.022 --> 11:30.290
SO WE'RE JUST
SUPPOSED TO SIT BACK

11:30.323 --> 11:31.324
AND NOT CHECK
HER BUTT?

11:31.358 --> 11:33.326
WE ARE HER PARENTS!

11:33.360 --> 11:34.327
HOLD ON A SECOND, OK?
WAIT.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.997
OK, I'M GONNA
FIND OUT WHAT'S UP.

11:37.397 --> 11:42.069
ANYTHING GOING
ON TONIGHT?

11:45.238 --> 11:48.108
TO THE RAVE, RIGHT?

11:48.141 --> 11:49.276
Both: THE RAVE?

11:49.309 --> 11:52.379
LET'S GO.
LET'S GO TO THE RAVE.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.247
WHAT'S A RAVE?

11:54.281 --> 11:56.349
YOU SHOULD ASK EDDIE.
HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT 'EM.

11:56.383 --> 12:00.220
YEAH, I'M FAMILIAR
WITH THE SCENE.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.238
I EVENTUALLY GOT
TIRED OF THE HASSLES.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.907
I MEAN, THE COPS
DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.441
YEAH, CAN YOU
BELIEVE THOSE
DUMB COPS?

12:21.474 --> 12:23.143
I MEAN, THEY CAN'T
EMBRACE THE IDEA

12:23.176 --> 12:24.444
OF TEENAGERS USING
ILLEGAL DRUGS

12:24.477 --> 12:25.879
IN CONDEMNED
WAREHOUSES.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.848
IN THIS DAY AND AGE!

12:27.881 --> 12:28.949
OH, MY GOD.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.084
SEEMS LIKE
JUST YESTERDAY

12:31.118 --> 12:32.319
SHE WAS
MY LITTLE BALLERINA

12:32.352 --> 12:35.255
AND NOW SHE'S
A TATTOOED
PARTY GIRL.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.224
WELL, I'M SURE
YOU'LL GET A CHANCE

12:37.257 --> 12:38.291
TO TALK TO HER SOON

12:38.325 --> 12:40.760
ON JERRY SPRINGER!

12:41.394 --> 12:42.963
OH, WE'LL TALK TO HER.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.131
WHEN EXACTLY?

12:44.164 --> 12:45.398
YOU KNOW WHAT, DAD?

12:45.432 --> 12:46.333
NOW!

12:46.366 --> 12:48.335
YOU KNOW, LILY
HAS GONE TOO FAR
ON THIS ONE.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.070
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA MARCH
RIGHT UP THERE

12:50.103 --> 12:52.906
AND GO, YES!
I WENT INTO YOUR
ROOM, YOUNG LADY.

12:52.940 --> 12:53.941
AND YES, I WENT
INTO YOUR DRAWER

12:53.974 --> 12:56.543
BECAUSE I'M YOUR DAD
AND I'M CONCERNED
ABOUT YOU.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.510
YES!
YES!

12:57.544 --> 12:58.478
YES, I WENT
INTO YOUR ROOM!

12:58.511 --> 13:00.113
I WENT INTO--
OH, I WENT INTO--

13:00.147 --> 13:01.548
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN'T EVEN
CALL IT YOUR ROOM

13:01.581 --> 13:03.884
UNTIL YOU START PAYING
RENT, YOUNG LADY!

13:03.917 --> 13:04.617
HEH HEH HEH! OK!

13:04.651 --> 13:06.253
YOUR ROOM!
MY HOUSE!

13:06.286 --> 13:08.088
Sean: IT'S--
NO, MY ROOM!

13:08.121 --> 13:09.422
SURE, SURE, SURE
I WAS IN YOUR ROOM.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.291
AND I'M GONNA DO IT
AGAIN WHENEVER I LIKE

13:11.324 --> 13:12.525
BECAUSE I'M YOUR FATHER!

13:12.559 --> 13:14.427
FATHERS--

13:14.461 --> 13:16.029
OK, SURE.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.135
YEAH, DAD?

13:22.169 --> 13:24.204
LILY, I THINK WE
SHOULD TALK ABOUT

13:24.237 --> 13:25.272
WHERE YOU WERE
TONIGHT.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.374
I WAS AT CHRISTINA'S.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.209
I DON'T THINK SO.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.343
WHY NOT?

13:30.377 --> 13:31.879
COULD IT BE BECAUSE

13:31.912 --> 13:33.046
YOU WERE IN MY ROOM!

13:33.080 --> 13:36.449
YOU VIOLATED MY PRIVACY,
YOU TRAMPLED MY TRUST,

13:36.483 --> 13:39.953
BECAUSE YOU WERE
IN MY ROOM!

13:41.388 --> 13:43.857
NO, I WASN'T.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.229
BOY, I REALLY
HIT THE JACKPOT.

13:49.262 --> 13:52.432
IT'S KENNY ROGERS,
CHERYL LADD,

13:52.465 --> 13:55.535
THE BLACK GUY
FROM MIAMI VICE.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.305
HE'S REALLY SPANK.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.174
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO GO IN MY ROOM!

14:01.208 --> 14:02.142
LOOK, THIS
IS MY HOUSE.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.643
I'LL GO INTO
ANY ROOM I WANT.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.645
WELL, WHY DON'T
YOU JUST GO IN
THE BATHROOM

14:05.678 --> 14:08.348
AND FLUSH YOUR FACE?

14:08.982 --> 14:10.583
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF I CHOOSE TO, I WILL.

14:10.617 --> 14:11.218
AND IN EITHER ONE

14:11.251 --> 14:14.121
BECAUSE THEY'RE
BOTH MINE!

14:14.154 --> 14:15.388
GO AHEAD!

14:15.422 --> 14:17.490
OH, SHE'S ON SOMETHING!

14:17.524 --> 14:21.528
I THINK SHE SNORTED
UP SOME OF THAT EXSTAMACY.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.164
HO HO HO,
THAT'S IT!

14:24.197 --> 14:25.432
I AM DONE WITH
THIS FAMILY.

14:25.465 --> 14:26.266
I AM DISOWNED!

14:26.299 --> 14:28.601
OH, COME ON.
YOU CAN'T DISOWN YOURSELF.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.037
FINE.
THEN I QUIT.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.104
WHOA!
FREEZE RIGHT THERE!

14:31.138 --> 14:36.243
YOUNG LADY, I AM
NOT CHASING YOU
TO ANY MORE RAVES.

14:37.110 --> 14:37.877
WHAT?

14:37.911 --> 14:41.614
HMM, HMM, HMM.
WE KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.

14:41.648 --> 14:45.252
YOU ACTUALLY WENT?

14:45.485 --> 14:47.955
'COURSE I WENT.
I--

14:48.155 --> 14:50.457
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"ACTUALLY"?

14:50.490 --> 14:52.392
I WAS AT CHRISTINA'S HOUSE.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.694
LIKE I SAID.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.164
HEY, LILY?

14:57.197 --> 15:00.167
THIS IS WEIRD.
YOU'RE ON-LINE.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.935
NO, I'M NOT.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.070
YES, YOU ARE.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.238
YOUR SCREEN NAME
JUST POPPED UP ON
MY BUDDY LIST. SEE?

15:05.272 --> 15:06.239
NO WAY.

15:06.273 --> 15:09.176
SOMEBODY SIGNED ON
WITH MY NAME!

15:09.209 --> 15:10.143
NO!

15:10.177 --> 15:11.311
YES!

15:11.344 --> 15:14.014
SEND THEM
AN INSTANT MESSAGE.
LILY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:15.015 --> 15:17.951
IT'S PROBABLY
MY LITTLE BROTHER.

15:17.985 --> 15:20.253
THEY'RE NOT ANSWERING.

15:20.287 --> 15:23.123
TYPE ARE YOU THERE?

15:23.991 --> 15:26.426
THIS IS SO FREAKING ME OUT.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.128
TOTALLY.

15:28.161 --> 15:31.264
"JUST HANGING. YOU KNOW,
KEEPING IT FRESH"?

15:31.298 --> 15:32.532
OH, MY GOD!

15:32.565 --> 15:34.467
IT'S MY DAD!

15:34.501 --> 15:36.269
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

15:36.303 --> 15:38.171
IT'S HIM.

15:38.205 --> 15:41.541
AH, YOU KNOW,
KEEPING IT FRESH.

15:41.574 --> 15:44.444
DID HE REALLY SAY
"KEEPING IT FRESH"?

15:44.477 --> 15:46.246
I'LL TALK TO HIM.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.680
SHOULD WE SIGN OFF?

15:47.714 --> 15:48.515
NO. MOVE OVER.

15:48.548 --> 15:52.319
I'M GOING TO SCREW WITH HIM
A LITTLE.

15:53.153 --> 15:56.356
CHRISTINA IS
SWEETANDNASTEE?

15:56.389 --> 16:00.127
OH, MAN! I KNEW IT!

16:00.160 --> 16:03.130
WHOA, WHOA.
WAIT A MINUTE.
THERE WAS AN ADDRESS...

16:03.163 --> 16:05.465
IN YONKERS
AND A PASSWORD

16:05.498 --> 16:09.202
PUMPKIN?
PUMPKIN!
THAT'S IT EXACTLY!

16:10.037 --> 16:11.171
OHH-H-H.

16:11.204 --> 16:14.274
I JUST MADE UP
AN ADDRESS AT RANDOM.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.210
WELL, THERE WAS
SOMETHING THERE.

16:17.244 --> 16:20.980
THIS IS IT--
540 WHITE STREET.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.251
IT'S A DRY CLEANERS.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.386
I BET THE KIDS
GET ALL MESSED UP

16:26.419 --> 16:28.055
ON DRY CLEANING CHEMICALS.

16:28.088 --> 16:31.258
AND THEN THEY PUT ON
OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.325
THAT'S SICK.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.161
THAT'S BRILLIANT.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.096
PHEW.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.803
A LOT OF CELEBRITIES

16:43.836 --> 16:45.038
YEAH.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.239

16:46.273 --> 16:47.107
KENNY ROGERS.

16:47.140 --> 16:50.743
"TO BOBBY,
YOU KNOW WHEN
TO FOLD 'EM."

16:50.777 --> 16:52.412
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

16:52.445 --> 16:53.780
HEY, I DON'T SEE A RAVE.

16:53.813 --> 16:56.116
IT'S PROBABLY DOWN
IN THE BASEMENT
OR SOMETHING.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.618
THAT'S WHAT
THE PASSWORD'S FOR.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.387
CAN I HELP YOU?

17:00.420 --> 17:01.621
OH, YEAH.
HEY, UM...

18:21.368 --> 18:22.302

TRYING TO FIND OUT.

19:07.514 --> 19:10.350
LILY, WE REMEMBER
WHAT IT WAS LIKE
TO BE TEENAGERS.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.319
YOU CAN'T HOLD YOU
AGAINST ME.

19:12.352 --> 19:16.223
I'VE GIVEN YOU NO REASON
TO BE SO SUSPICIOUS.

19:16.256 --> 19:19.926
OH, IS THAT SO,
MS. WINTERHAVEN?

19:19.959 --> 19:21.594
EXCUSE ME?

19:21.628 --> 19:26.399
UH, YEAH, MS. UH,
LILLIAN WINTERHAVEN.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.401
THAT'S NOT MINE.

19:28.435 --> 19:29.436
OH, IT'S NOT?

19:29.469 --> 19:31.371
WELL, IT'S NOT MY NAME.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.473
IT'S GOT
YOUR PICTURE ON IT.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.140
UCK!

19:34.173 --> 19:36.376
MOM, IT WAS
JUST A GOOF, OK?

19:36.409 --> 19:37.910
ALL THE KIDS AT SCHOOL
HAVE THEM.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.011
I HAVEN'T EVEN USED
MINE YET.

19:39.045 --> 19:42.715
YET! SEE, THAT'S
THE WORD THAT SCARES US.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.717
NAH-AH--AH-AH--UNH-UNH.

19:44.751 --> 19:45.685
NO.

19:45.718 --> 19:46.619
WHATEVER.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.421
Sean: WHOA! YOU STOP
RIGHT THERE, YOUNG LADY.

19:48.455 --> 19:51.458
THIS ISN'T
JUST ABOUT THE I.D.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.360
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:53.393 --> 19:57.864
WELL, THE I.D. WASN'T
THE ONLY THING I FOUND.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.300
UCK.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.969
WHAT ELSE DID YOU FIND?

20:03.002 --> 20:06.739
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL
WHAT I FOUND.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.008
OH, OK. THAT'S
NOT EVEN MINE.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.811
I'M JUST HOLDING IT
FOR CHRISTINA.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.747
YOUR MOTHER AND I
ARE SO DISAPPOINTED

20:14.781 --> 20:16.683
AND HEARTBROKEN.
AREN'T WE, BABY?

20:16.716 --> 20:21.388
DISAPPOINTED DOESN'T EVEN
BEGIN TO DESCRIBE...

20:21.421 --> 20:22.555
I'M SO SORRY.

20:22.589 --> 20:25.925
THIS WILL NEVER,
EVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.560
YOU BET YOUR ASS
IT WON'T.

20:27.594 --> 20:28.795
NOW, YOU MARCH UP
THOSE STAIRS

20:28.828 --> 20:30.997
AND YOU GET THAT THING
AND YOU BRING IT DOWN
HERE AND THEN...

20:31.030 --> 20:34.467
AND THEN WE'LL TALK
ABOUT MAYBE PUTTING
THIS THING BEHIND US

20:34.501 --> 20:38.605
AND THEN MAYBE I CAN
LOOK AT YOU THE SAME WAY
I USED TO LOOK AT YOU.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.674
LIKE THE DAUGHTER
I LOVED.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.943
OK.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.717
NICE WORK!

20:50.750 --> 20:51.751
NUMBER ONE.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.853
SCARED THE CRAP
OUT OF HER.

20:53.886 --> 20:54.854
YES, WE DID.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.289
OH, BABY, MMM!

20:56.323 --> 20:57.690
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT IS?

20:57.724 --> 21:00.427
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
WE'LL FIND OUT
IN A MINUTE.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.900
Lily: OOPS!

21:07.934 --> 21:11.304
AT LEAST WE KNOW
IT WASN'T A HANDGUN.

21:11.338 --> 21:16.075
Walter: OPEN THE SIDE!
I CAN'T BREATHE IN HERE!

21:16.108 --> 21:17.944
Jimmy: GRANDPA?

21:17.977 --> 21:20.046
WHERE ARE YOU?

21:20.079 --> 21:20.747
Walter: AAH!

21:20.780 --> 21:23.783
I JUST HIT
THE UMBRELLA STAND.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.852
OH, MY GOD!

21:25.885 --> 21:28.488
UH, GUYS, THIS IS
WAY, WAY, WAY TOO BIG.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.356
Eddie:
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

21:29.389 --> 21:31.023
THERE'S NO WAY TO GET
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

21:31.057 --> 21:34.361
Walter: AW,
THE HELL WITH IT!

21:37.830 --> 21:38.798
GRANDPA!

21:38.831 --> 21:40.567
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

21:40.600 --> 21:41.668
I'M SORRY, BOYS.

21:41.701 --> 21:44.637
I GOT TO USE THE BATHROOM.

21:44.671 --> 21:48.708
I'M SURPRISED THERE
ISN'T ONE IN THERE.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.843
THERE IS.

21:50.877 --> 21:52.879
OH, NO!
OH,GOD.

21:58.551 --> 21:59.719
OH, DON'T--WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

21:59.752 --> 22:01.721
YOU GUYS COMIN' BACK
FOR MORE?

22:01.754 --> 22:02.722
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.991
WE--WE--WE CAME
TO APOLOGIZE.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.759
WE MADE A MISTAKE.

22:06.793 --> 22:07.760
I'LL SAY.

22:07.794 --> 22:08.728
AND WE'RE SORRY

22:08.761 --> 22:11.998
AND WE WANT
TO GIVE YOU
YOUR PICTURES BACK.

22:15.535 --> 22:19.005
WHERE THE HELL'S
MY PHILIP MICHAEL THOMAS?

22:19.038 --> 22:19.772
WHO?

22:19.806 --> 22:22.074
THE BLACK GUY
FROM MIAMI VICE.

22:22.108 --> 22:25.111
AW, YOU--
RUN!
