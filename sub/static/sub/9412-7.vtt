Billy, what are you doing?

02:02.833 --> 02:04.833
Is that why they call you
Sheena of the jungle?

You should've seen your face.
"Help! Shark! Somebody, please!"

02:07.733 --> 02:10.600
Well, you can help me now.
Get me out of this boat.

If you're so scared of getting wet,
why'd you go fishing in the first place?

02:13.600 --> 02:17.100
I had to find something to do
around here. It's so boring.

02:17.100 --> 02:21.100
Why did Mom and Dad dump us
at Uncle Harold's for the whole summer?

02:21.100 --> 02:23.100
It's not that bad.

02:23.100 --> 02:25.100
Besides,
Uncle Harold's pretty cool.

02:25.100 --> 02:28.600
He's weird.
And he treats us like we're kids.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.600
But, Sheena, we are kids.

02:31.100 --> 02:32.700
I mean, look at this place.

We're, like, hundreds of miles
from the nearest town,

no TV.

- Billy, what are you doing?

I don't know about that.

Maybe he just came in.

- Where you going?
- Just gonna go take a look outside.

find Uncle Harold first.

Come on.
Don't be such a chicken.

where we're never supposed to go...

06:50.100 --> 06:52.100

And don't go into the water.
I'll be back soon.

18:40.567 --> 18:41.867
You can't go by yourself.

18:41.867 --> 18:44.900
You may need help, Harry.
We'll all go.

18:44.900 --> 18:48.133
Besides, he's probably just suffering
from heat stroke or something.

18:48.133 --> 18:51.133
[ Sighs ]
All right.

18:51.133 --> 18:54.133
Janet, call an ambulance.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.767
And make sure
that he's comfortable.

18:56.767 --> 19:00.033
Let's go.

19:24.433 --> 19:26.933
[ Click, Static ]

19:26.933 --> 19:28.933
[ Click ]

19:28.933 --> 19:30.933
[ Static Continues ]

19:30.933 --> 19:33.433
That's strange.

19:33.433 --> 19:35.967
The line's down again.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.100
I'll have to take the truck for help.

19:47.433 --> 19:50.433
[ Harry ] This must be
the last island in the bay.

19:50.433 --> 19:52.933
- [ Billy ] You've never been here?
- Not this far.

19:52.933 --> 19:55.933
[ Ritter ] I'll stay with the boat while
the three of you look for Lady Milton.

19:56.933 --> 19:58.933
[ Motor Stops ]

20:04.433 --> 20:07.433
Well, it looks like a deserted island.

20:07.433 --> 20:09.433
Race you to the cliff.

20:09.433 --> 20:11.467
Hey.
You guys get back here.

20:11.467 --> 20:15.567
- We're just scouting ahead.
- We have no idea what's on this island.

20:15.567 --> 20:17.967
That's what we're trying to find out.

20:17.967 --> 20:21.267
[ Motor Starting ]

20:21.267 --> 20:24.133
Jake, what do you think you're doing?

20:24.133 --> 20:27.300
- Protecting our experiment, Harry.
- What do you mean?

20:27.300 --> 20:28.800
I'm not gonna let you
throw away our work

20:29.300 --> 20:31.100
just 'cause you don't
have the guts to see it through.

20:31.100 --> 20:34.233
You can't just leave us on this island,
Ritter. This is insane!

20:36.233 --> 20:38.733
Have a nice life--

20:38.733 --> 20:40.967
What's left of it.

20:42.300 --> 20:45.300
- Is this some kind of joke?
- Bye-bye!

20:45.300 --> 20:47.800
- I wish it was.
- [ Ritter Laughing ]

20:50.467 --> 20:52.467
