WEBVTT

00:00.295 --> 00:02.280
So, who are you gonna choose?

00:03.058 --> 00:05.541
I'm sure by now you're all
aware that someone

00:05.566 --> 00:07.939
posted a list of Speckulate
employee salaries.

00:07.965 --> 00:09.037
I did it.

00:09.062 --> 00:11.184
I hacked into HR and I
posted the salaries online.

00:11.364 --> 00:12.414
I did it.

00:12.571 --> 00:14.246
- I did it.
- I did it.

00:14.510 --> 00:16.669
I know we're colleagues, but...

00:17.216 --> 00:18.674
do you mind if I kiss you?

00:18.881 --> 00:21.421
You know, maybe I'll develop
my app on my own.

00:21.829 --> 00:24.580
If you choose to leave, you
can't take your app with you.

00:24.605 --> 00:26.860
Is there anything in your personnel file

00:26.885 --> 00:29.900
- that you wouldn't want this jury to know about?
- Objection.

00:29.925 --> 00:32.814
The personnel file of Officer
Griffin is not in evidence,

00:32.839 --> 00:34.200
you rule to keep it under seal.

00:34.225 --> 00:36.455
Can't leak those files
to Jamal's attorney.

00:36.480 --> 00:38.295
Do not do something impulsive.

00:39.010 --> 00:42.073
I haven't felt this way
about anybody in a long time.

00:42.098 --> 00:43.298
I should have fought for you.

00:43.323 --> 00:46.245
By the way, I'm not
moving back to Wisconsin.

00:46.270 --> 00:48.354
I flew back because I
wanted to tell you in person.

00:48.379 --> 00:49.570
I left Lily.

00:49.595 --> 00:50.773
The truth is...

00:50.798 --> 00:53.231
I wish I was the one who
died that day, not Jacob.

00:53.572 --> 00:54.629
Who's Jacob?

00:55.010 --> 00:56.660
- Our son.
- Hello?

00:57.654 --> 01:00.116
I drove out to this cliff by the beach.

01:00.141 --> 01:01.471
I was gonna drive off.

01:01.496 --> 01:05.946
One of the voices that I kept
hearing in my head is yours.

I'd be happy to step up
in her place, Your Honor.

02:49.775 --> 02:50.901
That won't be necessary.

02:51.420 --> 02:53.303
Jamal Thompson trial will be in recess

02:53.328 --> 02:55.131
while I consider whether or not to allow

02:55.156 --> 02:56.707
Officer Griffin's personnel files in.

02:56.732 --> 02:59.423
- But you already ruled, Your Honor.
- That was on discovery.

02:59.448 --> 03:00.748
Correct. This is evidentiary.

03:00.773 --> 03:02.884
Well, if they were ill-gotten,
that would disqualify them.

03:02.908 --> 03:05.553
Well, the plaintiff claims that
the files were sent anonymously,

03:05.578 --> 03:07.670
which does not meet the
definition of ill-gotten.

03:07.695 --> 03:08.998
You could exclude the records

03:09.023 --> 03:10.716
based on failure to
properly authenticate them,

03:10.740 --> 03:12.500
under Federal Rule of Evidence 901.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.525
Thank you, Ben. I will
consider the obvious.

03:16.348 --> 03:17.388
That's all.

03:19.743 --> 03:20.783
Callie, may I have a word?

03:56.400 --> 03:58.920
So... they're all named Spartacus?

04:00.883 --> 04:03.588
No. They're all saying they're Spartacus

04:03.613 --> 04:06.863
- to cover for the real Spartacus.
- Oh.

04:07.097 --> 04:10.958
So everyone told us that
they released the salaries

04:11.383 --> 04:12.467
because...

04:13.243 --> 04:15.543
- that's all I got.
- Because Mariana did it.

04:19.601 --> 04:21.262
- What?
- Just talking about your app.

04:21.529 --> 04:22.829
Have you picked you team yet?

04:22.944 --> 04:25.944
Yeah, I heard there was,
uh, office space downstairs.

04:25.969 --> 04:27.553
Marketing Department, bottom floor.

04:28.349 --> 04:30.166

- Yeah.

- I am Raj.
- I am Raj.

04:34.924 --> 04:36.092
I am Raj.

04:36.117 --> 04:37.397
I don't think he gets it.

04:41.820 --> 04:45.520
_

04:45.545 --> 04:47.311
So, you think Wilson suspects you

04:47.336 --> 04:48.849
of taking the files from his office

04:48.874 --> 04:50.109
and giving them to Malika?

04:51.076 --> 04:52.076
I don't know.

04:52.791 --> 04:55.018
The young woman who sits
with Jamal's mother in court,

04:56.324 --> 04:57.950
is she the person you disclosed,

04:57.975 --> 04:59.332
who lives in your building?

04:59.649 --> 05:00.649
Yes, why?

05:02.031 --> 05:03.089
Just curious.

05:04.219 --> 05:05.539
That's all he asked.

05:07.032 --> 05:09.282
Uh, I'm not sure I want to
know the answer to this.

05:10.578 --> 05:11.976
Did you take the files?

05:12.271 --> 05:13.363
No.

05:13.667 --> 05:16.226
No, I didn't take them
from Wilson's office,

05:16.251 --> 05:18.853
but I did receive them, anonymously.

05:19.150 --> 05:21.312
Someone had them messengered
to me at The Coterie.

05:21.336 --> 05:23.712
I have no idea who. But
in them, Griffin confirmed

05:23.737 --> 05:26.186
that he was present when the
former police chief, Robert Kelley,

05:26.210 --> 05:27.489
said it's better for the department

05:27.513 --> 05:28.985
to let victims of police shootings die.

05:29.009 --> 05:30.237
You should have told Wilson.

05:30.262 --> 05:32.168
You should have given them
to him, immediately.

05:32.193 --> 05:34.750
- No one knows I have them.
- The person who sent them to you does.

05:34.774 --> 05:36.786
They can't prove that I got
them, or that I read them.

05:36.810 --> 05:38.594
Callie! Don't be so naive!

05:38.781 --> 05:40.678
If Wilson finds out you had those files

05:40.703 --> 05:42.766
before the plaintiff's attorney
presented them in court

05:42.790 --> 05:44.359
you're going to be the prime suspect.

05:44.384 --> 05:45.878
You could face criminal charges.

05:45.903 --> 05:47.241
Not to mention, the bar could refuse

05:47.265 --> 05:48.924
to ever give you a
license to practice law.

05:48.948 --> 05:51.511
The jury needs to hear what's
in those files. It's not fair.

05:51.536 --> 05:52.974
Throwing your career under the bus

05:52.999 --> 05:54.607
isn't going to change anything.

05:54.632 --> 05:56.153
Reckless behavior, as,

05:56.478 --> 05:57.975
as righteous as you think it may be,

05:58.000 --> 05:59.466
has real consequences.

05:59.491 --> 06:01.458
This could follow you
for your entire life.

06:01.483 --> 06:02.700
I mean, don't you get that?

06:04.862 --> 06:06.422
I mean, what am I going to do with you?

06:08.362 --> 06:10.202
Oh, you don't need to
do anything with me.

06:11.223 --> 06:14.516
Yeah, maybe I'm too naive and
reckless for you to be bothered with.

06:35.586 --> 06:36.685
Where have you been?

06:37.331 --> 06:38.549
Doctor's appointment.

06:40.226 --> 06:42.101
So, Wilson had me write a bench memo

06:42.126 --> 06:44.688
arguing against allowing the
personnel records in as evidence.

06:45.162 --> 06:47.656
I knocked it out of the park,
if I do say so myself.

06:47.681 --> 06:49.933
- He let you read them?
- No.

06:50.976 --> 06:52.567
Don't you think that's unusual?

06:52.982 --> 06:55.550
To ask you to defend a position
on a document you haven't read?

06:56.278 --> 06:57.518
I really don't care.

06:59.069 --> 07:00.660
Do you care about anything, Ben?

07:00.755 --> 07:02.555
Except for career advancement?

07:07.688 --> 07:09.363
You know, my father
took a job as a janitor

07:09.387 --> 07:11.638
in one of the best college
prep-schools in the country,

07:11.952 --> 07:14.432
so he could get a discount on
the tuition for me to go there.

07:16.147 --> 07:18.507
My mother worked seven
days a week waiting tables.

07:19.889 --> 07:21.409
If I get to be a Supreme Court clerk,

07:21.434 --> 07:24.178
I'll get a 300K signing bonus
at any law firm of my choosing.

07:25.363 --> 07:27.732
I'm going to use that money to
buy my parents a house. So...

07:28.849 --> 07:30.567
career advancement, sure.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.528
But what motivates me most, is
taking care of the two people

07:33.552 --> 07:35.192
who made all this possible for me.

07:38.589 --> 07:39.661
You know, Callie,

07:40.029 --> 07:41.811
you could have gone straight
to work at a non-profit,

07:41.835 --> 07:42.935
but don't kid yourself.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.836
You applied for this clerkship
for the same reason we all did.

07:47.223 --> 07:49.276
It's an elite path to success,
and you know it.

07:49.732 --> 07:50.849
Good night.

08:08.812 --> 08:09.870
Yes?

08:12.535 --> 08:14.161
I'd like to offer precedent

08:14.186 --> 08:16.977
that would allow you to
let the personnel files in.

08:17.346 --> 08:20.193
I think that these records
are extremely relevant

08:20.218 --> 08:21.704
to the plaintiff's Monell claim

08:21.729 --> 08:23.561
that the city had an informal policy

08:23.586 --> 08:25.633
to let suspects die instead
of giving them critical care.

08:25.657 --> 08:27.282
How do you know what's inside the files?

08:27.551 --> 08:30.059
The Supreme Court held
in Connick v. Thompson

08:30.083 --> 08:31.918
that plaintiffs could prove
deliberate indifference...

08:31.942 --> 08:33.142
You didn't answer my question.

08:34.087 --> 08:37.378
Did you... take the
files from this office?

08:38.706 --> 08:39.756
No, sir.

08:39.883 --> 08:41.543
They were sent to me anonymously.

08:41.568 --> 08:43.607
Why would someone send you the files?

08:45.789 --> 08:46.789
I don't know why.

08:47.686 --> 08:49.769
But I didn't show them to anyone.

08:49.794 --> 08:52.364
- I give you my word on that.
- The Monell claim doesn't apply.

08:52.730 --> 08:55.506
There's no evidence that this
was an actual police policy.

08:55.531 --> 08:58.274
- It's a comment made by one man.
- The police chief.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.617
This is smoking-gun evidence of notice

09:00.642 --> 09:02.151
by the policymaker himself.

09:02.176 --> 09:03.284
You're stretching the precedent

09:03.308 --> 09:06.480
to provide the outcome you want,
not the law supporting it.

09:08.788 --> 09:10.371
With all due respect, Your Honor,

09:10.717 --> 09:12.458
you may think you're
not an activist judge,

09:12.483 --> 09:15.987
but you have consistently protected
the police as an institution

09:16.012 --> 09:18.813
regardless of the actions
of individual officers.

09:19.415 --> 09:21.595
There is no such thing
as an impartial judge

09:21.620 --> 09:23.066
on the left or the right.

09:23.091 --> 09:24.593
You choose conservative precedents,

09:24.618 --> 09:27.018
not because you have to,
because you want to.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.160
Is that all?

09:31.236 --> 09:32.276
Yes, sir.

09:33.216 --> 09:36.034
We'll discuss what to do
about your failure to disclose

09:36.059 --> 09:38.601
that you were in possession
of sealed documents tomorrow.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.889
Um, hi, I'm Alice Kwan,

09:52.111 --> 09:53.635
and I'm new to stand-up.

09:55.119 --> 09:57.730
I mean, why do they even call
it stand-up? You know, 'cause...

09:58.198 --> 10:01.726
the first guy who did it
decided to stand and not sit?

10:02.739 --> 10:05.941
I mean, what if he'd sat? You know,
would it be called sit-down?

10:06.164 --> 10:08.266
I'm going to do some sit-down tonight.

10:10.467 --> 10:12.546
So, I recently came out to my parents.

10:13.032 --> 10:16.901
♪ My brain's electric,
eccentric, unstoppable... ♪

10:16.926 --> 10:19.707
We read that gay people like rainbows.

10:20.567 --> 10:23.258
Oh, yeah, they... We do. Thanks.

10:23.572 --> 10:26.147
But you're not going to cut
your hair short, are you?

10:26.172 --> 10:27.698
Your hair is so pretty,

10:27.893 --> 10:29.903
and you will still wear dresses?

10:30.891 --> 10:32.075
Sure, yeah.

10:34.997 --> 10:38.080
Of course, no one in
the family can know.

10:43.278 --> 10:46.122
So, they're fine with me being gay,

10:46.147 --> 10:50.682
as long as I'm not
"too gay", or... or out.

10:51.928 --> 10:55.806
So, two steps out of the
closet, one step back in.

10:55.936 --> 10:57.928
Kind of caught in the door jamb.

10:58.965 --> 11:00.064
Help!

11:04.644 --> 11:06.019
That was amazing.

11:06.463 --> 11:07.538
It was?

11:08.004 --> 11:11.055
I mean, it was for me. For sure.

11:11.660 --> 11:15.706
It's just, you know, sometimes the
first time with someone can be...

11:16.124 --> 11:18.175
not as good as the second time.

11:19.010 --> 11:21.457
The second time was just as
amazing as the first time.

11:22.652 --> 11:24.268
Wait till the third time.

11:24.587 --> 11:26.637
That's when I really
pull out all the tricks.

11:26.662 --> 11:28.345
Oh, he has tricks.

11:29.111 --> 11:32.172
Come on, the Kamasutra came from India.

11:32.197 --> 11:34.714
Ooh, maybe we should
make a Kamasutra app.

11:35.808 --> 11:38.126
I'd love to see you pitch that to Evan.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.882
Actually, I would not like that.

11:40.607 --> 11:42.833
Don't worry, I talked to Angela.

11:43.527 --> 11:45.329
Evan didn't come on to Amanda.

11:45.550 --> 11:47.988
She quit because she got a
better offer somewhere else.

11:48.532 --> 11:50.475
It's not him I need to worry about,

11:50.500 --> 11:53.960
it's the sexist nerds that work for him.

11:54.266 --> 11:56.366
Not including you, by the way.

11:57.298 --> 12:01.300
You know, in fact, I was
kind of hoping that, maybe,

12:01.802 --> 12:03.314
you'd want to join my team.

12:04.233 --> 12:05.325
Really?

12:10.866 --> 12:15.751
So... what's the plan now?

12:17.529 --> 12:19.529
You know, they have
grief support groups.

12:22.449 --> 12:24.689
I know what I need to do. I just...

12:25.754 --> 12:27.794
I never really dealt with it, you know?

12:28.699 --> 12:29.815
I'm going to be fine.

12:33.493 --> 12:36.036
I really don't want anybody to know

12:36.426 --> 12:38.336
about Jacob, or that
I was in the hospital.

12:38.640 --> 12:39.965
- Okay?
- Yeah.

12:40.447 --> 12:41.487
Of course.

12:46.906 --> 12:47.966
But...

12:49.397 --> 12:52.107
you do need someone to talk to.

12:52.660 --> 12:53.944
I have someone to talk to.

12:55.152 --> 12:56.168
I have you.

13:05.110 --> 13:10.180
So, um, I do think that
it's important to kind of,

13:10.205 --> 13:11.832
you know, keep this on the D.L.

13:12.016 --> 13:13.908
Just for optics and all.

13:17.620 --> 13:18.620
Got it.

13:23.387 --> 13:24.678
Uh, can I use the bathroom?

13:24.703 --> 13:25.943
Yeah, go for it.

13:27.077 --> 13:29.437
Uh, yeah, it's just right
through there, right?

13:40.102 --> 13:42.653
Oh, uh, um...

13:42.678 --> 13:45.558
What... I... The, the, the
bathroom's just d-down the hall.

13:45.583 --> 13:48.601
- Down the hall. Cool. I should, um...
- Yeah, just over there.

13:56.954 --> 14:00.630
I am so sorry that I
looked at your penis...

14:00.812 --> 14:03.288
Jamie! Hi.

14:04.274 --> 14:05.373
Hey.

14:06.906 --> 14:09.533
There were girls in the
bathroom, so I didn't want...

14:09.558 --> 14:11.244
You, you two know each other, right?

14:11.985 --> 14:13.461
Yes. Yes, we do.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.878
- From, uh, Davia's birthday.
- Right. Yeah.

14:15.974 --> 14:19.149
- How you doing?
- Great. Good.

14:19.174 --> 14:20.556
I'm sorry, I was just, uh...

14:20.581 --> 14:23.274
Oh, it's fine. I actually
have to go anyway.

14:23.299 --> 14:25.049
So, um, I'll text you later.

14:25.758 --> 14:26.833
Great.

14:28.737 --> 14:30.630
Didn't mean to barge in.
The door was open.

14:30.655 --> 14:33.556
- No worries.
- Uh, is Callie around?

14:33.781 --> 14:36.517
Uh, if she's not in the lounge,
I would try the roof?

14:36.816 --> 14:37.816
Will do.

14:38.525 --> 14:40.851
- It's over there.
- That's right. Thank you.

14:57.679 --> 14:58.754
Hey.

14:59.233 --> 15:00.308
Hey.

15:06.079 --> 15:07.079
How are you?

15:09.700 --> 15:13.844
Uh, you know, okay for an amateur artist

15:13.869 --> 15:17.229
whose work is unprovocative and passé.

15:17.799 --> 15:19.849
You didn't see the review of
the show in The Times?

15:19.874 --> 15:21.424
Whoever wrote that is an idiot.

15:21.817 --> 15:23.968
Or maybe the person who
bought a piece from me is.

15:24.780 --> 15:25.814
He's not.

15:27.896 --> 15:30.172
- He?
- Or she.

15:32.717 --> 15:34.717
I've never had that much
fun making anything.

15:39.916 --> 15:41.523
Well, don't be discouraged.

15:42.230 --> 15:43.779
You're a brilliant artist.

15:44.104 --> 15:45.104
I believe in you.

15:49.247 --> 15:50.247
You okay?

15:54.360 --> 15:55.600
You want to talk about it?

15:57.845 --> 15:58.845
No.

16:01.090 --> 16:05.794
No, I don't want to talk or
think about anything right now.

16:37.378 --> 16:38.458
Jamie?

17:01.511 --> 17:02.627
I'm sorry.

17:05.445 --> 17:06.445
Me too.

17:26.585 --> 17:29.304
Sorry. I'm sorry.

17:29.568 --> 17:31.418
Look, you know I want you,

17:32.118 --> 17:35.964
but I don't want to be this
drug that numbs you out.

17:36.131 --> 17:38.223
Someone that you just
want to get lost in.

17:39.219 --> 17:41.690
Look, when, and if this
is real, let me know.

17:41.692 --> 17:44.071
But please don't use me
because you don't want to deal

17:44.096 --> 17:46.196
with whatever it is
that's bothering you.

17:48.891 --> 17:50.132
It's not fair, Callie.

17:58.871 --> 18:00.392
I know how hard it was for you

18:00.417 --> 18:02.618
not to slip those personnel
records to Jamal's lawyers,

18:02.643 --> 18:04.693
and you deserve a lot
of credit for that,

18:04.788 --> 18:06.513
and I admire you so much

18:06.794 --> 18:08.511
for wanting to fight for social justice

18:08.536 --> 18:10.197
and change what is
wrong with the system.

18:11.222 --> 18:14.790
And I, uh...

18:16.257 --> 18:19.775
I realize I came across as patronizing.

18:20.915 --> 18:21.957
I'm sorry.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.500
I just want to protect you.

18:30.226 --> 18:31.659
Because I, uh...

18:34.790 --> 18:35.848
I love you.

19:02.781 --> 19:06.800
And please destroy
Griffin's personnel records

19:06.825 --> 19:08.351
and never tell anyone you had them.

19:09.658 --> 19:11.175
Especially, Judge Wilson.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.491
_

19:21.100 --> 19:25.100
_

19:25.842 --> 19:29.442
_

19:31.910 --> 19:34.910
_

19:37.155 --> 19:41.155
_

19:41.671 --> 19:43.671
_

19:44.302 --> 19:47.302
_

19:47.327 --> 19:49.009
- Yes.
- _

19:50.741 --> 19:54.241
_

19:54.265 --> 19:56.265
_

19:58.949 --> 20:00.649
_

20:00.674 --> 20:02.766
Sorry, Alice.

20:04.408 --> 20:06.000
Aw, poor, Alice.

20:07.288 --> 20:08.528
Why, "poor Alice"?

20:09.630 --> 20:10.896
Oh, nothing.

20:12.770 --> 20:13.802
What, you don't like it?

20:14.374 --> 20:16.374
I do. I just had a late lunch.

20:17.554 --> 20:19.794
I'll finish it later, I promise.

20:23.550 --> 20:25.069
Have you spoken to your ex?

20:26.347 --> 20:28.289
- Have you spoken to yours?
- No.

20:28.652 --> 20:31.132
But I didn't leave him a suicidal
message on his voice mail.

20:33.087 --> 20:34.767
I let her know I'm all right.

20:37.646 --> 20:39.086
She played the message for me.

20:42.704 --> 20:44.087
What did you mean when you said

20:44.696 --> 20:46.756
you wanted her to have everything?

20:49.251 --> 20:51.171
Everything a happy life has to offer.

20:54.091 --> 20:55.675
Are you still in love with her?

20:56.318 --> 20:58.459
- Are you still in love with Jeff?
- No.

20:58.773 --> 21:00.208
- And stop doing that!
- What?

21:00.233 --> 21:01.233
Deflecting.

21:04.331 --> 21:05.823
Did something happen

21:06.220 --> 21:08.380
that made you suddenly
want to kill yourself?

21:09.659 --> 21:10.819
No.

21:11.731 --> 21:13.531
It wasn't that sudden.

21:19.703 --> 21:20.823
So, it's over with Jeff?

21:23.123 --> 21:24.247
Yes.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.224
Will you promise me

21:33.134 --> 21:35.666
that if you ever feel
suicidal again, that you...

21:35.691 --> 21:37.200
you'll just come to me?

21:37.769 --> 21:40.335
Please, at any time, day or night.

21:40.470 --> 21:43.821
Just tell me before you do anything?

21:48.011 --> 21:49.127
I promise.

21:54.293 --> 21:56.977
Do it. It's very serious.

22:08.999 --> 22:12.292
So, um, in certain communities,

22:12.317 --> 22:16.085
any behavior considered
to be not conforming

22:16.110 --> 22:18.642
with a group value is frowned upon.

22:18.667 --> 22:21.394
Like, gayness for example,

22:21.663 --> 22:23.734
and not just the gay person gets judged,

22:23.759 --> 22:25.624
everyone in their family does, too.

22:26.152 --> 22:31.635
So, as to not bring shame on
to my fifth cousin, Alfred,

22:32.672 --> 22:36.357
uh, I can be gay, just in private.

22:37.300 --> 22:39.220
And that's kind of the biggest problem,

22:39.245 --> 22:42.938
'cause I sort of promised someone
that I'd be out and proud.

22:45.724 --> 22:47.967
Hey, so I have to tell you something.

22:48.662 --> 22:51.514
I'm gay. Lesbian. Into the ladies.

22:51.697 --> 22:54.156
What? Just kidding, I know.

22:54.265 --> 22:55.632
I've had a feeling for a while.

22:55.729 --> 22:58.622
- Did we come out to our parents?
- Yes, we did.

22:58.647 --> 23:00.630
And they also already knew.

23:00.655 --> 23:02.990
So, now that we all know.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.265
I accept us and love us very much.

23:05.372 --> 23:06.455
Thank you.

23:06.918 --> 23:08.869
- Let's tell the world!
- Let's do it!

23:09.654 --> 23:11.495
- I'm gay!
- _

23:13.483 --> 23:16.459
Hi! Hi there. Hi there.
Uh, I'm, I'm gay!

23:16.484 --> 23:18.364
I'm gay! I'm out and I'm proud.

23:18.389 --> 23:19.877
I, I just wanted the world to know!

23:19.901 --> 23:21.664
_

23:21.689 --> 23:24.589
So, there's this girl named
Joey, oh, I like her a lot,

23:24.614 --> 23:25.917
and now that I'm out and proud,

23:25.942 --> 23:28.109
I'm hoping she'll give
me another chance.

23:28.134 --> 23:30.710
Joey, don't let a good thing go.

23:30.735 --> 23:32.126
I'm a, I'm a good thing!

23:32.275 --> 23:35.772
Joey, she's adorable, please
give her another chance.

23:39.142 --> 23:40.635
_

23:40.660 --> 23:43.160
So, there you have it.

23:43.317 --> 23:45.261
Uh, I'm out to my parents.

23:45.618 --> 23:50.593
Out to myself. Out to a number
of random people on the street.

23:51.132 --> 23:55.710
And everyone agrees that you
should give me a third chance.

23:56.353 --> 23:57.553
Hope to hear from you soon.

24:40.612 --> 24:41.712
Hey.

24:42.822 --> 24:45.356
Hey, Hot Raj.

24:46.086 --> 24:47.819
I remember these.

24:48.262 --> 24:49.587
We used to play with them all the time.

24:49.611 --> 24:52.480
Got them at museums when I was a kid.

24:55.677 --> 24:57.827
Uh, great sex yesterday.

24:57.852 --> 24:58.951
Yeah.

24:59.585 --> 25:00.599
Hey, Raj!

25:00.624 --> 25:03.158
When you're done playing with
that phallus, we've got a scrum.

25:03.183 --> 25:05.683
- Come on.
- Come on, boy. Come on!

25:08.459 --> 25:09.499
See ya.

25:12.036 --> 25:13.116
Hello.

25:15.029 --> 25:17.497
I just wanted to say I'm
so pleased you're staying,

25:17.831 --> 25:20.461
and I'm very enthusiastic
about your app.

25:20.901 --> 25:22.880
And I want you to know
that now that Josh is gone,

25:22.913 --> 25:26.401
you can, you can bring
any issues to my attention.

25:27.607 --> 25:30.401
Um... thank you, but you know,

25:30.426 --> 25:33.407
I don't want to be known
as the Complainer in Chief.

25:33.870 --> 25:35.912
Maybe you should make
yourself accessible

25:35.937 --> 25:37.956
to all of your employees
and their issues.

25:38.861 --> 25:39.935
Good idea.

25:42.388 --> 25:43.888
Oh, I remember these.

25:49.326 --> 25:50.726
Never could get the hang of that.

26:01.117 --> 26:02.428
Ms. Walker,

26:02.453 --> 26:05.480
I'm admonishing you for attempting
to blindside the defense

26:05.505 --> 26:07.750
with your line of questioning
before we recessed.

26:08.033 --> 26:09.910
I find no legal precedent

26:09.935 --> 26:12.459
that compels the court to
allow this new evidence in.

26:13.966 --> 26:18.419
However, I find no precedent
that clearly precludes it.

26:18.809 --> 26:20.237
Therefore, you may enter

26:20.262 --> 26:23.427
Officer Griffin's personnel
files into the record.

26:40.274 --> 26:43.368
Were you present when Chief Robert
Kelly told a group of officers

26:43.393 --> 26:45.342
that it's better for the department

26:45.367 --> 26:47.569
to let victims of police shootings die?

26:47.594 --> 26:48.601
Yes.

26:48.626 --> 26:50.570
Did you take his comments as an order?

26:50.595 --> 26:52.955
- No, I did not.
- Where do you get your authority from,

26:52.980 --> 26:55.627
- as a police officer?
- From our superiors.

26:55.652 --> 26:58.429
- Like the chief of police?
- I guess.

26:58.454 --> 27:00.745
Did you think Chief Kelly
was giving you the authority

27:00.770 --> 27:02.991
- to let Jamal Thompson die?
- No, sir.

27:03.016 --> 27:06.239
So, if he doesn't care about
victims of police brutality,

27:06.414 --> 27:07.938
- why should you?
- Objection.

27:07.963 --> 27:10.093
- Testifying.
- Sustained.

27:10.634 --> 27:12.453
Did you think you would
face any consequences

27:12.478 --> 27:14.523
if you failed to provide
prompt critical care?

27:14.741 --> 27:16.165
We needed to secure the scene

27:16.190 --> 27:17.599
before we sent E.M.T.'s in

27:17.624 --> 27:19.265
to make sure Mr. Thompson
wasn't a threat.

27:19.290 --> 27:21.674
You shot him seven times.

27:21.699 --> 27:23.669
He collapsed in a pool of his own blood.

27:23.694 --> 27:25.494
What possible threat did you perceive?

27:25.519 --> 27:28.594
- Objection. Testifying.
- Sustained.

27:39.119 --> 27:41.936
You're so hot. I love your body.

27:42.844 --> 27:44.178
Everything about you.

27:45.423 --> 27:46.463
Thank you.

27:58.916 --> 28:01.142
Um, um, you're, you're,
you're hurting me.

28:01.596 --> 28:04.671
Oh, uh, sorry.

28:06.193 --> 28:07.589
You know what? Uh, we should,

28:07.914 --> 28:09.668
we should just probably
get back to work.

28:09.693 --> 28:11.252
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?

28:11.718 --> 28:13.043
Nothing. You know, it's just...

28:13.618 --> 28:15.144
I don't know, this was a bad idea.

28:15.169 --> 28:16.727
You know, we don't
have a lot of time and,

28:16.751 --> 28:18.289
and I just, I got to work on my team...

28:18.313 --> 28:20.553
Am I the first uncircumcised
guy you've been with?

28:26.212 --> 28:30.330
Okay. Look, I felt bad
about the way I looked at it,

28:30.355 --> 28:31.888
and, I don't know,

28:31.913 --> 28:34.063
I... It-it's just because
I had never seen one before.

28:34.328 --> 28:37.238
Not because I don't like it,
which I do very much.

28:38.008 --> 28:41.018
But I don't know, I asked
my friends what to do.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.596
You told your friends?

28:42.621 --> 28:45.421
Well, Alice left the conversation early.

28:45.855 --> 28:48.101
I guess what my friends
told me to do was wrong

28:48.125 --> 28:49.558
and I'm sorry.

28:51.349 --> 28:52.389
I didn't mean to hurt you.

28:54.119 --> 28:55.193
It's okay.

28:56.071 --> 28:58.806
Maybe, instead of asking your friends,

29:00.104 --> 29:02.204
you should ask me what to do with it.

29:04.583 --> 29:06.960
Okay. So...

29:07.796 --> 29:09.388
what should I do with it?

29:09.413 --> 29:10.513
Oh.

29:17.750 --> 29:19.654
Thanks for giving me another chance.

29:20.107 --> 29:22.107
Your video was adorable.

29:22.393 --> 29:24.019
How could I resist?

29:24.411 --> 29:26.770
You know, it does feel
really good to be out.

29:27.014 --> 29:28.064
I know.

29:28.908 --> 29:32.459
In fact, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

29:34.322 --> 29:37.107
I'm thinking of changing
my pronouns to "they-them".

29:39.139 --> 29:43.657
Uh, i-is this pending,
or effective immediately?

29:46.851 --> 29:51.020
I have no idea how I'm going
to introduce they to my folks.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.634
I mean, the positive side,

29:53.659 --> 29:55.973
there's no gender pronouns in Mandarin.

29:57.592 --> 30:01.102
But on the negative, Joey doesn't speak Mandarin.

30:01.127 --> 30:02.144
Oh.

30:02.904 --> 30:06.239
Hey, sorry. I tripped over
this paint can over here.

30:06.264 --> 30:07.608
Oh. What are you doing down here?

30:08.308 --> 30:10.668
This is where I smoke my weed.

30:10.693 --> 30:12.218
How long have you been standing there?

30:12.936 --> 30:16.911
Uh, somewhere around, "I
came out to my parents."

30:17.103 --> 30:19.840
- So, the whole entire time.
- Pretty much.

30:19.865 --> 30:23.192
I, I was just working on,
uh, material for my stand-up.

30:23.932 --> 30:27.559
If I even end up doing it,
which I'm not sure I will.

30:27.584 --> 30:29.869
Yeah. Yeah. But, hey...

30:30.531 --> 30:33.991
if you do, you should
have some actual jokes.

30:35.947 --> 30:36.947
Right.

30:39.220 --> 30:40.247
See ya.

30:41.608 --> 30:44.259
If both sides are ready,
we'll hear closing arguments.

30:45.180 --> 30:46.631
The Supreme Court has ruled

30:46.656 --> 30:49.943
that what matters is whether
or not the officers in question

30:49.968 --> 30:52.921
had reasonable fear of
a threat to their lives,

30:52.946 --> 30:54.996
based on their assessment alone.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.829
Can you think of any reason

30:57.475 --> 31:00.676
that Jamal would suddenly
stop running, turn around,

31:01.049 --> 31:04.726
and lunge at two police
officers with guns drawn,

31:04.751 --> 31:06.326
armed only with a cell phone?

31:06.691 --> 31:09.191
Based on their experience
on the streets,

31:09.648 --> 31:11.882
it's not unreasonable to believe

31:12.175 --> 31:13.580
Jamal might have been armed.

31:13.605 --> 31:14.847
Because he was black.

31:15.663 --> 31:18.489
Because they embrace racist stereotypes,

31:18.514 --> 31:19.942
they assumed he was armed

31:20.162 --> 31:21.278
and gunned him down.

31:21.303 --> 31:24.140
- When faced with a potential threat...
- Jamal was no threat.

31:24.165 --> 31:26.886
These officers owed it to
their wives and children...

31:26.911 --> 31:28.527
And after they shot him in the back...

31:28.552 --> 31:30.239
To make sure they came
home from work that night.

31:30.263 --> 31:31.989
They let him bleed to death,

31:32.638 --> 31:35.531
because his life did not matter to them.

31:35.773 --> 31:38.281
Officers Griffin and
Turani got to go home

31:38.306 --> 31:39.867
to their wives and children that night.

31:40.197 --> 31:44.041
Jamal will never go home to his
mother, Sandra, and his family.

31:44.265 --> 31:47.313
He'll never be married,
never have a child of his own.

31:48.271 --> 31:51.897
Sandra Thompson is no longer a mother.

31:53.638 --> 31:58.531
She's lost her only child,
and that is not right.

31:59.822 --> 32:01.331
This must stop.

32:03.421 --> 32:06.322
But they won't stop it.

32:08.245 --> 32:09.245
It's up to us.

32:11.772 --> 32:12.772
It's up to you.

32:36.931 --> 32:38.207
Could I get a flat white?

32:39.390 --> 32:40.464
Hey.

32:40.841 --> 32:42.575
Have you seen all the
fallout from the spreadsheet?

32:42.599 --> 32:44.140
It's all over the Internet.

32:44.165 --> 32:46.758
No, I've been trying my best to
stay off the Internet, actually,

32:46.783 --> 32:48.716
with all the bro-holes harassing me.

32:48.741 --> 32:50.417
Screw them. We have your back.

32:50.442 --> 32:52.531
Totally, and we got you something.

32:53.731 --> 32:54.748
Guys!

32:59.359 --> 33:00.467
Thank you.

33:03.663 --> 33:06.239
But, you know, maybe I'll
just use this at home.

33:06.573 --> 33:10.200
And look, we know you can't
choose all of us for your team.

33:10.225 --> 33:11.467
So, don't feel weird about it.

33:11.492 --> 33:14.572
We're just so excited for the first
all-female team at Speckulate!

33:22.656 --> 33:26.380
So, if everyone knows that Mariana
released the salaries online,

33:26.405 --> 33:28.725
and Speckulate is getting
all this crap for it,

33:28.750 --> 33:30.670
how is she still here?
Why didn't she get fired?

33:30.992 --> 33:33.242
Because she's boning the boss.

33:33.267 --> 33:34.926
- Oh.
- That's not true.

33:34.951 --> 33:37.552
Oh, yeah? How would you know?

33:37.577 --> 33:39.839
- What, cause she's boning you?
- He wishes.

33:39.864 --> 33:42.275
- He's so in the friend zone.
- You can't believe

33:42.300 --> 33:43.749
a girl can be as smart as you,

33:43.774 --> 33:46.174
so you have to say she's sleeping
with the boss to get ahead.

33:46.356 --> 33:48.210
No wonder the women here
are angry and frustrated.

33:48.234 --> 33:51.536
They have to work with a
bunch of misogynistic morons.

33:51.561 --> 33:53.386
I bet you can't even
spell "misogynistic".

33:53.411 --> 33:56.137
Yeah, what is it? Like "mas"... M-A-S...

33:56.304 --> 33:58.231
- "Misogyn... "It's like a S-H"?
- Hey, Mariana.

33:58.256 --> 34:00.014
Can you spell "misogynistic"?

34:00.341 --> 34:02.802
A-L-E-X?

34:03.056 --> 34:04.216
That's pretty good.

34:08.109 --> 34:09.685
Hey, good morning, Evan.

34:09.904 --> 34:14.447
So, um, I'm taking your advice
on being more accessible.

34:14.706 --> 34:16.675
I'm moving my offices down here.

34:16.699 --> 34:17.891
Uh, Red Team is moving upstairs,

34:17.916 --> 34:20.007
so you and your team
can have their offices.

34:20.507 --> 34:23.139
Oh, n-no. I, I don't, I don't
need that much space.

34:23.165 --> 34:25.255
I-I'm happy to move down to Marketing.

34:25.281 --> 34:27.172
- I heard that they have room.
- No. That's not necessary.

34:27.197 --> 34:28.599
I want us to be on the same floor.

34:29.148 --> 34:30.257
All of us.

34:34.701 --> 34:37.368
I have some ideas about your
app, if you, have a moment.

34:37.886 --> 34:39.005
Sure.

34:50.925 --> 34:52.491
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:52.516 --> 34:54.020
I'm so happy to hear your voice.

34:54.355 --> 34:55.831
Everything here is so screwed up.

34:55.857 --> 34:57.260
Lily's calling everyone we know

34:57.285 --> 34:59.769
and telling them I was having
an affair and I'm leaving her.

34:59.794 --> 35:01.810
Even my family's pissed at me.

35:02.421 --> 35:03.846
This is so hard.

35:04.222 --> 35:06.147
- I know.
- But it'll all be worth it

35:06.172 --> 35:08.856
when you move home and we
can finally be together.

35:08.881 --> 35:11.055
I miss you so much.

35:11.080 --> 35:14.021
- I love you.
- Me too.

35:38.516 --> 35:41.110
On the first complaint
of excessive force

35:41.135 --> 35:43.163
in violation of Section 1983,

35:43.188 --> 35:44.801
the jury finds the defendant...

35:47.960 --> 35:48.986
not liable.

35:52.736 --> 35:56.066
On the second complaint, of
failure to provide critical care,

35:57.921 --> 35:59.566
the jury finds the defendants...

36:06.844 --> 36:09.312
... also not liable.

36:36.682 --> 36:38.058
That's not what this is about.

36:38.082 --> 36:39.802
- Then what is it about?
- Me.

36:39.826 --> 36:40.830
Trying to take care of myself.

36:40.854 --> 36:42.469
Trying to stop throwing my life away.

36:42.494 --> 36:45.247
You spent our entire marriage
taking care of yourself.

36:45.769 --> 36:49.186
Jacob had to get cancer for
you to pay any attention to him.

36:49.230 --> 36:50.647
You were a shitty husband!

36:50.672 --> 36:51.832
And a shitty father!

36:56.125 --> 36:57.765
Daddy?

37:00.666 --> 37:01.906
I can't sleep.

37:03.206 --> 37:04.914
Jacob, go back to bed.

37:05.108 --> 37:06.933
Will you come lie down with me?

37:06.958 --> 37:08.266
I can't. I'm working.

37:08.291 --> 37:09.460
Daddy, please?

37:09.485 --> 37:11.710
Dammit, Jacob! I said go back to bed!

37:56.385 --> 37:59.911
I'm tired of white juries
and white judges

37:59.936 --> 38:01.896
protecting these officers who kill us.

38:02.448 --> 38:05.491
Who shoot us and beat us to death,

38:05.516 --> 38:07.333
without fear of consequences.

38:07.806 --> 38:11.375
A Supreme Court who uses
racism as its justification.

38:11.743 --> 38:14.703
If they fear us, if they hate us,

38:15.012 --> 38:16.753
then it's okay to kill us.

38:16.778 --> 38:19.805
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

38:19.830 --> 38:23.059
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

38:23.084 --> 38:25.822
- Black lives matter!
- I am not the only mother

38:25.847 --> 38:28.490
whose child has been
stolen by law enforcement.

38:29.022 --> 38:31.214
I stand here today
with Geneva Reed-Veal,

38:31.686 --> 38:34.212
Gwen Carr, Lesley McSpadden,

38:34.353 --> 38:37.283
and all the other grieving
mothers fighting for answers

38:37.308 --> 38:39.801
and accountability where there is none.

38:40.320 --> 38:43.294
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

38:43.319 --> 38:45.997
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

38:46.022 --> 38:48.058
- Black lives matter!
- Well, they might as well have shot me today.

38:48.082 --> 38:49.382
I wish they would have.

38:49.407 --> 38:53.467
I wish they would have put me
out of this pain and this misery.

38:53.734 --> 38:55.259
Officer Lawrence Griffin

38:55.595 --> 38:58.413
and Officer Amir Turani
murdered my baby.

38:59.396 --> 39:00.963
I will never hold him again.

39:01.203 --> 39:03.226
I will never laugh at
his silly jokes again.

39:03.251 --> 39:07.696
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

39:07.721 --> 39:10.814
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

39:10.839 --> 39:13.664
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

39:13.689 --> 39:14.901
Black lives matter!

39:14.926 --> 39:18.566
I will never hear him say,
"I love you, Mama", ever again.

39:19.193 --> 39:21.902
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

39:21.927 --> 39:24.834
Jamal's life mattered!
Jamal's life mattered!

39:24.859 --> 39:27.946
Jamal's life mattered!
Jamal's life mattered!

39:27.971 --> 39:30.900
Jamal's life mattered!
Jamal's life mattered!

39:30.925 --> 39:33.884
Jamal's life mattered!
Jamal's life mattered!

39:33.909 --> 39:36.849
Jamal's life mattered!
Jamal's life mattered!

39:36.874 --> 39:39.600
Jamal's life mattered!
Jamal's life mattered!

39:48.308 --> 39:51.170
Federal Marshals. Are
you Callie Adams Foster?

39:53.587 --> 39:56.000
- Yes.
- Will you come with us please?

39:56.519 --> 39:57.577
What's this about?

39:57.739 --> 40:00.031
Do you have your federal
court security card on you?
