08:46.690 --> 08:47.923
You're learning chinese.

08:47.925 --> 08:49.691
Part of a citywide chief initiative

08:49.693 --> 08:51.026
'cause I don't have enough on my plate.

08:51.028 --> 08:52.327
Oh. Busy day?

08:52.329 --> 08:55.296
Well, I have a budget meeting,
a heart transplant,

08:55.298 --> 08:57.932
and a high-security flying
in from Kingston any minute,

08:57.934 --> 08:59.834
so yes, you could say that.

08:59.836 --> 09:02.270
The car crash I rode in on.
I'd like in on the surgery.

09:02.272 --> 09:03.538
- Patrick's on call.
- Yeah, I know.

09:03.540 --> 09:04.939
I met him. He's great.

09:04.941 --> 09:07.108
Unlike your terrible lying,
he is an excellent surgeon.

09:07.110 --> 09:08.395
[cellphone buzzes] I'm sure he is.

09:08.445 --> 09:10.712
But the patient, I sort of
promised her that I'd be there.

09:10.714 --> 09:11.979
She's a single mother.

09:11.981 --> 09:14.014
Well, then, she's used to
people breaking their promises.

09:14.244 --> 09:15.750
Except that I had my
finger in her chest cavity

09:15.752 --> 09:17.017
when I made that promise, Dawn.

09:18.386 --> 09:20.054
Fine, I don't have time to argue.

09:20.056 --> 09:21.789
Assist Dr. Curtis, scrub up.

09:21.791 --> 09:23.357
Thank you.

09:23.359 --> 09:25.059
<i>Bu kuh chi.</i>

09:26.694 --> 09:28.528
[chuckles] Wow.

09:28.530 --> 09:30.664
[telephone rings in distance]

09:30.666 --> 09:33.834
How is she doing?

09:33.836 --> 09:34.935
Vitals are all over the map,

09:34.937 --> 09:36.503
and she's still losing a boatload of blood.

09:36.505 --> 09:37.604
What's the imaging show?

09:37.606 --> 09:39.005
Nothing. It's inconclusive.

09:39.007 --> 09:41.074
Okay, so we have blunt
trauma to the abdomen,

09:41.076 --> 09:42.575
which means that it's likely...

09:42.577 --> 09:43.709
Liver or spleen.

09:43.711 --> 09:45.578
I've ordered a speed-tract
and a trauma lap tray

09:45.580 --> 09:46.980
with extra sponges.

09:46.982 --> 09:48.514
She's unstable, so we're gonna...

09:48.516 --> 09:49.649
So, we will pack first,

09:49.651 --> 09:51.651
and then work systematically
to find the bleeder.

09:51.653 --> 09:53.419
[monitor beeping]

09:53.421 --> 09:55.554
That was, uh, quite an
entrance you made this morning.

09:55.556 --> 09:57.590
I'm not usually that dramatic.

09:57.592 --> 09:58.758
Eh, that's not what I heard.

09:58.760 --> 09:59.691
Really?

09:59.693 --> 10:02.394
Car crashes.

10:02.396 --> 10:04.362
Comas.

10:06.132 --> 10:07.666
Giving birth
at your board examinations.

10:07.668 --> 10:09.467
Actually, it was in the ambulance

10:09.469 --> 10:11.503
on the way back from the boards.

10:11.505 --> 10:15.207
Sorry if I've overstepped.

10:15.209 --> 10:17.509
Don't worry about it. Really.

10:17.511 --> 10:20.145
So, what brought you here, Dr. Curtis?

10:20.147 --> 10:22.281
Would you believe love?

10:22.283 --> 10:24.382
It didn't exactly work out.

10:24.384 --> 10:27.686
- Sorry to hear that.
- So is she, I hope.

10:28.788 --> 10:30.087
They're almost finished prepping.

10:30.089 --> 10:31.589
We should probably hurry up and meet again.

10:31.591 --> 10:33.425
Alex.

10:33.427 --> 10:36.060
I'm... I had an aunt named Alex.

10:36.062 --> 10:38.596
[chuckles]
Bit of a moose was old aunty Alex.

10:38.598 --> 10:41.633
You don't remind me of her at all,
which is good.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.268
I'm Patrick.

10:44.270 --> 10:45.403
I can't shake your hand.

10:45.453 --> 10:47.231
No, no, of course. Of course, you can't.

10:51.476 --> 10:54.244
Mr. Fong in bed 3 needs
an I&D for an abscess.

10:54.246 --> 10:55.612
And I shall order it.

10:55.614 --> 10:57.948
And I shall administer it.

10:58.450 --> 10:59.667
Really?

10:59.819 --> 11:01.852
Melanda transferred six weeks ago.

11:01.854 --> 11:02.986
We broke up three months ago.

11:02.988 --> 11:05.589
Yeah, but when'd you stop sleeping together?

11:05.591 --> 11:06.556
[pops lips]

11:06.558 --> 11:07.590
I guess you don't waste any time.

11:07.592 --> 11:09.559
Life is short, Lin.

11:09.561 --> 11:10.960
- Dr. Lin.
- Yep.

11:11.052 --> 11:12.928
- Can I borrow you for a sec?
- Yeah.

11:13.267 --> 11:15.431
Just tried to triage a 50-year-old
female, Vivian Gerbasi.

11:15.433 --> 11:16.966
She's got terrible abdominal pain,

11:16.968 --> 11:18.033
but that's all I got.

11:18.035 --> 11:19.435
She insists on talking to a doctor.

11:19.437 --> 11:21.170
Let's meet her.

11:21.172 --> 11:23.773
- [panting]
- Hi, Ms. Gerbasi.

11:23.775 --> 11:24.741
I'm Dr. Lin.

11:24.743 --> 11:26.175
Please, call me Viv.

11:26.536 --> 11:28.177
Okay, let's take a look.

11:28.227 --> 11:29.621
Ohh.

11:30.647 --> 11:32.398
Let me know if you feel any pain, okay?

11:32.497 --> 11:33.515
Okay.

11:33.517 --> 11:36.118
It just came on, all of a sudden.

11:36.120 --> 11:38.120
I'm sure
that it's just jet lag, but...

11:38.122 --> 11:39.588
- Where were you?
- Oh.

11:39.590 --> 11:41.556
It's gonna come on now.

11:43.126 --> 11:45.160
[coughing]

11:50.332 --> 11:51.732
- I'll take it.
- I'm sorry.

11:51.734 --> 11:53.601
It's okay.

11:55.837 --> 11:57.272
Where were you traveling, Viv?

11:58.638 --> 12:01.538
That's why I insisted
on talking to a doctor.

12:01.811 --> 12:03.978
I was in the Ivory Coast.

12:05.247 --> 12:08.482
As in, the country next to Liberia.

12:08.484 --> 12:09.951
Okay, Lin, call a code orange.

12:09.953 --> 12:11.097
We need to secure an isolation room,
all right?

12:11.147 --> 12:13.071
- Got it.
- Cabrera? Hey.

12:13.121 --> 12:16.156
I need you to secure all
the PPE we can find.

12:16.158 --> 12:17.857
I'm gonna call the NML
and get her out of here.

12:17.859 --> 12:19.192
Are you saying this patient has eb...

12:19.194 --> 12:20.727
Whoa, whoa, Serena, we don't know that.

12:20.729 --> 12:21.795
We don't know anything yet.

12:21.797 --> 12:23.196
Until we do, it's business as usual.

12:23.198 --> 12:25.032
- Okay?
- Oh, god.

12:25.034 --> 12:26.166
Hey.

12:28.102 --> 12:29.269
Just in case.

12:30.638 --> 12:32.072
- Don't even think about it.
- You wish.

12:32.074 --> 12:35.341
[monitors beeping]

12:35.343 --> 12:37.376
Her belly is filling up with blood.

12:37.378 --> 12:40.746
Okay, let's go! Pack, pack, pack.
All four quadrants.

12:40.748 --> 12:42.281
[suction hissing]

12:42.283 --> 12:44.083
Ugh, it's not helping. Dr. Baumann, is...

12:44.085 --> 12:45.517
Is the blood running under pressure?

12:45.519 --> 12:47.086
It needs to go in as quickly as possible.

12:47.088 --> 12:49.221
I'm on it, boss.

12:50.057 --> 12:51.657
Okay.

12:51.659 --> 12:53.224
[monitor beeps]

12:53.226 --> 12:54.827
Okay, everything's tight.

12:54.829 --> 12:56.595
Now, let's put it in reverse.

12:56.597 --> 12:57.763
Alex, be ready to...

12:57.765 --> 12:59.397
Suction? Got it.

13:00.767 --> 13:02.701
- Here you go.
- All right.

13:02.703 --> 13:04.269
Safe with the liver.

13:04.271 --> 13:08.540
Gallbladder, colon, it's okay.

13:08.542 --> 13:10.909
With the amount of blood,
it's probably the aorta.

13:10.911 --> 13:12.510
You should go directly to
the left lower quadrant.

13:12.512 --> 13:13.878
We unpack clockwise. That's the procedure.

13:13.880 --> 13:14.979
Left upper quadrant next...

13:14.981 --> 13:16.380
Okay, I know that's what we normally do...

13:16.382 --> 13:18.048
That's how it's always done.

13:19.651 --> 13:22.052
Pancreas, spleen, both good.

13:22.054 --> 13:26.256
Okay, there you are, you scandalous bugger.

13:26.258 --> 13:27.625
It is the aorta.

13:27.627 --> 13:29.560
The force of the impact must have torn it.

13:29.562 --> 13:32.530
- You need to cross-clamp to stop the bleed.
- It's carnage. I can't see a thing.

13:32.532 --> 13:34.164
Well, you need to find the
defect and put a stitch in it.

13:34.166 --> 13:35.264
- If you don't...
- Or she'll die.

13:35.266 --> 13:36.466
That's the same on both sides of the pond.

13:36.468 --> 13:38.969
Make a decision, guys.
She's not coping well.

13:38.971 --> 13:42.372
You got one chance at this. It's your call.

13:42.374 --> 13:44.374
I'll do it blind. Aortic clamp.

13:51.660 --> 13:54.193
I have the celiac trunk. Damn it.

13:54.195 --> 13:56.095
There's barely any space. It slipped.

Systolic is 70.

We can't keep up with the blood loss.

You know what? You had your chance.

14:02.470 --> 14:03.569
It's the angle. If I could just...

14:03.571 --> 14:06.372
Well, I'm left-handed.
I can get it from here.

14:06.374 --> 14:07.773
Clamp.

14:07.775 --> 14:08.807
We're losing her!

14:10.377 --> 14:11.910
Dr. Curtis, please.

Suction.

Blood pressure's climbing back up.

14:26.526 --> 14:28.526
What do you know?

14:30.463 --> 14:32.865
I'll close the defect on my own.

14:32.867 --> 14:34.332
I can stay on to assist.

No, it's...

[monitors beeping steadily]

14:37.704 --> 14:40.004
I'm sure a surgeon of your caliber

14:40.006 --> 14:41.306
could be of more use somewhere else.

14:42.775 --> 14:44.542
Sorry. Do you mind?

14:44.544 --> 14:46.578
Of course.

14:48.147 --> 14:51.349
Um, if you do need me for anything...

14:51.351 --> 14:53.318
Yeah, I'll page you.

Okay.

Oh, delivered safely to the doctor's lounge.

15:07.934 --> 15:09.233
Okay, I'm here to call in my favor.

15:09.435 --> 15:11.773
Okay. Uh, great. Shoot.

15:11.823 --> 15:13.167
Okay, so I'm spearheading

15:13.217 --> 15:14.805
an exciting, new,
cutting-edge Alzheimer's study.

15:14.855 --> 15:16.369
We're going to be pitching
to three board members

15:16.419 --> 15:17.958
in less than an hour to secure some funding.

15:18.008 --> 15:18.876
"We"?

15:19.487 --> 15:21.932
Yeah, well, Dr. Baldwin was
in line to be my orthopod,

15:21.982 --> 15:23.132
but he fell with the flu, so...

15:23.182 --> 15:24.588
And you want me to pinch hit?

15:24.638 --> 15:26.401
Okay, so the study involves
injecting the patient

15:26.451 --> 15:28.334
with an anti-inflammatory
drug called toramex.

15:28.384 --> 15:30.161
We inject it into the
spine right by the neck.

15:30.211 --> 15:31.195
Then we tilt the body

15:31.245 --> 15:33.167
so we encourage blood
flow right to the brain.

15:33.217 --> 15:35.970
You know, neurologists at UCLA
have seen great results with it.

15:36.020 --> 15:37.841
Okay, great. Get them to
present with you, then.

15:37.891 --> 15:38.929
Okay, if anybody should be supporting

15:38.931 --> 15:40.330

15:40.332 --> 15:41.597
I would think you of all people.

15:41.599 --> 15:42.933
Okay, well, I'd still want
to read up on it, Shahir.

15:42.935 --> 15:44.234
Well, the pitch is this afternoon.

15:44.385 --> 15:47.453
Okay, then, Shahir, no. Come on. I'm out.

Is that before or after I
start bleeding out of my eyes?

16:05.757 --> 16:07.490
Okay, please don't move.

16:10.798 --> 16:13.996
There hasn't been a reported
case in the Ivory Coast.

16:13.998 --> 16:16.566
I'd be the first.

16:16.568 --> 16:17.967
Patient zero.

16:17.969 --> 16:20.202
How unlucky am I?

16:20.204 --> 16:23.072
Tell me more about the trip.
Why the Ivory Coast?

16:23.584 --> 16:28.310
Um... you ever have a dream,
when you were little, I mean?

16:28.312 --> 16:30.612
[chuckles] Sure.

16:30.614 --> 16:34.116
It was to kiss Bobby McMillian
behind the portables,

16:34.118 --> 16:35.584
which I did.

16:35.586 --> 16:37.619
[laughs] How did that turn out?

16:37.621 --> 16:40.789
He told everyone I sexually harassed him,

16:40.791 --> 16:42.992
and my parents
started home schooling me.

16:42.994 --> 16:45.560
Oh, dear. [chuckling] I'm sorry.

16:45.562 --> 16:49.830
Mine was to see the pygmy hippopotamus.

16:49.832 --> 16:51.665
[chuckles]

16:51.667 --> 16:53.634
My father showed me a picture of them

16:53.636 --> 16:55.503
when I was a little girl.

16:55.505 --> 16:59.807
They were so cute
with their little webbed toes.

16:59.809 --> 17:01.675
I promised myself

17:01.677 --> 17:04.645
that before I turned 50
that I would see them.

17:04.646 --> 17:06.747
And that happened last week.

17:06.749 --> 17:09.817
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.352
When my boyfriend, Sam,

17:11.354 --> 17:15.856
heard about my... stupid childhood promise,

17:15.858 --> 17:17.892
he-he was the one.

17:17.894 --> 17:20.359
He made me do it.

17:20.362 --> 17:23.130

17:23.132 --> 17:25.999
- [chuckles]
- That's amazing.

17:26.633 --> 17:28.001
And then I broke up with him.

17:28.002 --> 17:29.804
Oh?

17:29.806 --> 17:33.173
He was... he's younger than I am,

17:33.175 --> 17:34.308
18 years.

17:34.310 --> 17:36.109
18 years? Go, Viv.

17:36.111 --> 17:38.145
[laughs]

17:39.648 --> 17:44.117
Said he didn't care about the age gap.

17:44.119 --> 17:47.220
He said he didn't want any kids.

17:47.222 --> 17:48.455
He said all the right things.

17:48.457 --> 17:50.424
You still broke up with him?

17:52.126 --> 17:54.027
You can't know what you don't know.

17:59.934 --> 18:03.003
The heart is a mysterious little muscle.

18:05.139 --> 18:07.040
I'm gonna die alone here, aren't I?

18:19.886 --> 18:21.120
You know, I've been gone less than a year,

18:21.170 --> 18:22.547
and it seems like everything's changed.

18:22.597 --> 18:24.657
There's new staff. Dawn is learning chinese.

18:24.659 --> 18:26.125
[laughs]

18:26.127 --> 18:28.060
It's like I've fallen down a rabbit hole.

18:28.062 --> 18:29.662
Yeah.

18:29.664 --> 18:31.931
Things are pretty different around here.

18:31.933 --> 18:34.033
I guess I forget how much sometimes.

18:34.686 --> 18:37.069
Yeah, and everywhere I look,
it's just that...

18:37.661 --> 18:40.439
maybe nothing's really changed
except that he's not here.

18:46.012 --> 18:47.312
What's that?

18:47.372 --> 18:51.984
Um, this is Luke's
long-form birth certificate.

18:51.986 --> 18:53.018
Came in the mail this morning.

18:53.020 --> 18:55.320
The name of the father is still empty.

18:55.322 --> 18:58.056
[inhales sharply] Right.

18:58.058 --> 19:00.125
Well, we've been living
in such a blissful bubble,

19:00.127 --> 19:01.660
I haven't wanted to burst it, so...

19:01.662 --> 19:04.095
I know. Me, too.

19:04.320 --> 19:05.564
You think it's time?

19:09.035 --> 19:10.200
I don't know. Maybe.

19:10.202 --> 19:13.203
[cellphone buzzes]

19:13.205 --> 19:15.740
- [sighs]
- I'm needed in the O.R. again.

19:16.181 --> 19:17.072
Car crash?

19:17.122 --> 19:18.509
No, I'm actually not sure what this is.

19:18.511 --> 19:20.411
Okay, go.
We'll worry about this later.

19:20.413 --> 19:21.445
Okay.

19:25.383 --> 19:26.884
[chuckles]

19:37.265 --> 19:39.050
Dr. Sharpe, what have you got?

19:39.100 --> 19:40.721
A patient got flown in from Kingston.

19:40.771 --> 19:41.950
He's got a ruptured ulcer.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.901
Somebody better get in there
and patch him up, then.

19:44.031 --> 19:46.066
That's the thing. I can't put him under.

19:46.116 --> 19:46.770
What?

19:46.772 --> 19:48.885
Turns out, he's also got severe sleep apnea.

19:48.935 --> 19:50.753
His airway's just too tight
to get a tube down him.

19:50.803 --> 19:52.839
You're thinking high thoracic epidural.

19:52.889 --> 19:54.662
Dr. Bell says you're the
only surgeon on staff

19:54.712 --> 19:56.450
who's ever pulled off an awake surgery.

19:56.622 --> 19:58.322
That was Joel's idea, actually.

19:58.646 --> 20:00.727
[chuckles] Why doesn't that surprise me?

20:00.777 --> 20:02.631
Naomi Rios, single mother
from the car crash.

20:02.681 --> 20:03.355
How's she doing?

20:03.405 --> 20:05.330
It's touch and go.
Dr. Curtis is still operating.

20:05.380 --> 20:06.220
He's thorough.

20:06.337 --> 20:08.153
That's one word for it.

20:09.843 --> 20:11.551
Look, I know
it's your first day back...

20:11.601 --> 20:12.629
No, go ahead.

20:12.631 --> 20:13.830
- You sure?
- Yeah.

20:13.832 --> 20:15.098
Let's do an awake surgery.

20:15.100 --> 20:17.000
There is one more thing about this patient.

20:17.002 --> 20:19.603
He was convicted of killing his wife.

20:19.989 --> 20:22.270
Okay, good to know.

20:27.556 --> 20:28.829
Mr. Crenshaw.

20:29.285 --> 20:31.676
So, you're the one who's gonna cut me open.

20:31.947 --> 20:32.989
Yes.

20:33.414 --> 20:34.535
What's your name?

20:34.585 --> 20:36.115
It's policy not to give the inmates

20:36.165 --> 20:37.946
any personal information.

20:38.072 --> 20:40.044
She's about to look at my guts.

20:40.359 --> 20:42.999
Doesn't get any more personal than that.

20:45.299 --> 20:47.115
I'm pretty freaked out here.

20:47.822 --> 20:49.664
My name is Dr. Reid. Alex.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.365
I'm here to get you better.

20:52.328 --> 20:54.535
Can you remove these handcuffs, please?

21:11.203 --> 21:13.304
[monitors beeping steadily]

21:16.541 --> 21:18.976
Mr. Crenshaw, can you feel this?

21:18.978 --> 21:20.544
Crenshaw: No.

21:21.922 --> 21:24.514
I hope you've got steady hands.

21:24.516 --> 21:26.083
You haven't been drinking, have you?

21:26.085 --> 21:27.852
[chuckles] No.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.253
[chuckling] Good.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.654
That's good.

21:30.656 --> 21:33.423
Although I could really
go for one right now.

21:33.425 --> 21:36.927
I used to work as a bartender
in this fancy country club.

21:38.029 --> 21:39.128
Ice, please?

21:40.631 --> 21:42.298
After dark, I'd sneak out on the course

21:42.300 --> 21:44.634
and pretend I was the type of guy

21:44.636 --> 21:47.237
that could afford to play there.

21:47.239 --> 21:49.439
You golf, doc?

21:49.441 --> 21:51.675
No, I don't have the time.

21:51.677 --> 21:53.877
You feel this?

21:53.879 --> 21:56.012
Not a thing.

21:56.014 --> 22:00.784
I took it up years later,
when I married Amy.

22:00.786 --> 22:02.419
Became that type of guy, I guess.

22:02.421 --> 22:05.188
Okay, let's get started.

22:05.190 --> 22:07.490
Scalpel?

22:07.492 --> 22:09.658
You sure I'm not gonna feel anything?

22:09.660 --> 22:13.096
If you do, you let us know.

22:14.598 --> 22:16.465
No offense, I don't trust doctors.

22:16.467 --> 22:18.368
None taken.
I don't trust criminals.

22:18.370 --> 22:21.637
Fair enough.

22:21.639 --> 22:23.039
It was a doctor that got me put away.

22:23.041 --> 22:24.340
Officer: That's enough.

22:24.342 --> 22:25.608
Alex: Actually, that's okay.

22:25.610 --> 22:27.377
It's important that everybody
stays calm and relaxed

22:27.379 --> 22:28.344
while in here.

22:28.346 --> 22:30.679
It's not in my job description.

22:30.681 --> 22:33.181
Well, it is in mine, and this is my O.R.,
so I call the shots.

22:33.323 --> 22:34.715
Got it?

22:37.021 --> 22:38.153
Thank you.

22:38.633 --> 22:41.312
You're welcome. Dr. Sharpe?

22:41.513 --> 22:43.573
He's all yours.

22:53.503 --> 22:56.371
[alarms beeping] [gasping]

22:57.673 --> 22:58.706
She's seizing.

22:59.875 --> 23:02.610
Okay, we need 2 milligrams of lorazepam

23:02.612 --> 23:04.512
and some phenytoin
in case she doesn't respond.

23:04.514 --> 23:07.950
[choking]

23:09.819 --> 23:12.120
Damn it!

23:14.023 --> 23:15.324
Screw it. I'm going in.

23:15.326 --> 23:17.158
No, Zach! No, no!

23:17.160 --> 23:18.693
Zach, you can't go in there!

23:18.695 --> 23:20.929
Let's go. Let's go!

23:20.931 --> 23:22.831
Come on!

23:22.833 --> 23:24.332
Hey, that's okay.

23:24.334 --> 23:26.334
[choking continues]

23:26.336 --> 23:27.502
Okay.

23:31.574 --> 23:33.341
There you go. There you go. There you go.

23:33.343 --> 23:34.876
[choking stops]

23:34.878 --> 23:36.243
[coughs]

23:36.245 --> 23:38.212
[monitor beeping steadily]

23:42.550 --> 23:45.151
Alex: Tom, you have a nasty-looking ulcer

23:45.153 --> 23:46.587
that's been perforated.

23:46.589 --> 23:47.955
I need to patch this.

23:47.957 --> 23:49.356
I wish I was surprised.

23:49.358 --> 23:52.693
Gut's been a mess since they put me inside.

23:52.695 --> 23:56.797
Okay. JP drain.

23:56.799 --> 23:57.931
Fixing the plumbing, doc?

23:57.933 --> 24:00.868
Kind of, yeah.

24:00.870 --> 24:02.735
Okay.

24:02.737 --> 24:04.937
You might feel a little pull here.

24:04.939 --> 24:07.640
I thought I wasn't
supposed to feel anything.

24:07.642 --> 24:09.509
More like a little pressure.

24:09.511 --> 24:11.344
Just try to take a nice,
deep breath for me now.

24:13.714 --> 24:16.049
Mnh, I can't get a good breath in.

24:16.051 --> 24:17.984
Suction, please.

24:17.986 --> 24:19.419
[monitor beeps rapidly]

24:19.421 --> 24:21.254
Pulse is rising.

24:21.256 --> 24:23.156
Seriously, I-I can't do this.

24:23.158 --> 24:24.156
He's pushing.

24:24.158 --> 24:25.725
Sedation. Deep breaths, Tom.

24:25.727 --> 24:27.493
- Deep breaths.
- I can't!

24:27.495 --> 24:28.861
You know what, Tom?

24:28.863 --> 24:30.963
Try to think of a place that
is nice and calm and relaxing.

24:30.965 --> 24:32.071
- Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god.
- Listen to my voice.

24:32.132 --> 24:33.833
Why don't you describe it to me?
What does it look like?

24:33.835 --> 24:35.034
The... the barn.

24:35.036 --> 24:36.769
Amy and I, we'd sneak off, but...

24:36.771 --> 24:38.004
[screams, inhales sharply]

24:38.006 --> 24:39.580
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- You felt that?

24:39.648 --> 24:42.241
Mm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
all on my right side.

24:42.243 --> 24:43.308
More propofol, Dr. Sharpe.

24:43.310 --> 24:45.710
I'm on it!

24:45.712 --> 24:47.145
Okay, try to keep him steady, please.

24:47.147 --> 24:49.180
[grunting]

24:51.150 --> 24:52.918
What's happening to me?

24:52.920 --> 24:54.953
[monitor beeping steadily]

24:57.957 --> 25:00.158
Lorazepam worked like a charm.

25:00.160 --> 25:03.261
She should be in sleepy
town for a while now.

25:05.998 --> 25:07.866
Her boyfriend's camping out, huh?

25:07.868 --> 25:09.968
Maggie: Sam... yeah.

25:09.970 --> 25:12.503
He insists he's not leaving.

25:13.872 --> 25:15.940
Where is that blood work?

25:15.942 --> 25:17.108
Zach, what are you doing in there

25:17.110 --> 25:19.177
without any protective gear?

25:19.179 --> 25:21.279
- Do you have a death wish?
- [scoffs]

25:21.281 --> 25:22.613
What am I supposed to think?

25:22.615 --> 25:24.115
Think whatever you want, Maggie.

25:24.117 --> 25:25.749
- That's mature.
- Well, screw mature.

25:25.751 --> 25:27.017
No, seriously, what were you thinking,

25:27.019 --> 25:28.086
just charging in there?

25:28.088 --> 25:29.253
I was thinking that she was gonna die

25:29.255 --> 25:30.555
while you're out there
fiddling with your gear.

25:30.557 --> 25:32.356
It's protocol to protect yourself.

25:32.358 --> 25:36.294
Well... it's my job to protect the patient.

25:40.365 --> 25:43.667
He's been here all day.

25:43.669 --> 25:44.935
He's beating himself up

25:44.937 --> 25:47.170
for letting her go to Africa on her own.

25:48.220 --> 25:50.641
Maybe he'll make it up to her.

25:50.643 --> 25:53.043
Well, let's hope he gets the chance.

25:56.114 --> 25:57.615
Tom, Tom, listen to me.

25:57.617 --> 25:58.916
You are going to be okay, all right?

25:58.918 --> 26:00.183
We're gonna take good care of you.

26:00.185 --> 26:02.419
I'm in a lot of pain here.

26:02.421 --> 26:04.421
Okay, the epidural isn't working.
Dr. Sharpe?

26:04.423 --> 26:06.624
Uh, blood pressure's rising.
He's going into shock.

26:06.626 --> 26:08.725
Breathing is compromised.
Bring in the wedge.

26:08.727 --> 26:11.360
Let's get this retractor out
of here and give me that towel.

26:11.362 --> 26:13.195
All right, let's take this off.

26:13.197 --> 26:14.697
[metal utensils clatter]
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

26:15.699 --> 26:17.299
Oh, god.

26:18.669 --> 26:21.037
Hold onto him!

26:21.039 --> 26:24.340
We're gonna move up in one, two, three, up.

26:24.342 --> 26:25.908
There we go.

26:25.910 --> 26:28.910
- Oh, god. Oh, god.
- Hand on him.

26:28.912 --> 26:30.446
You're gonna be okay, Tom.
You're gonna be okay.

26:30.448 --> 26:32.548
Dr. Sharpe!

26:32.550 --> 26:35.284
Try to relax if you can.

26:35.286 --> 26:38.587
Airway's too tight. I can't intubate.

26:38.589 --> 26:41.590
Okay, prepare for a crash trach. Scalpel!

26:41.592 --> 26:42.791
[alarm beeping]

26:42.793 --> 26:44.760
Stay with me here, Tom. Stay with me.

26:44.762 --> 26:46.828
Dr. Sharpe?

26:46.830 --> 26:47.963
Go.

26:47.965 --> 26:50.465
Okay. Hold onto him for me, all right?

26:50.467 --> 26:51.832
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

26:53.869 --> 26:56.237
- He's under.
- Let's get him breathing.

26:56.239 --> 26:59.006
[monitors beeping rapidly]

27:03.627 --> 27:05.728
[monitor beeping, air hissing]

27:09.332 --> 27:11.300
I am not gonna lose someone
on my first day back.

27:11.302 --> 27:13.235
3-0 silk.

27:13.237 --> 27:15.505
[suction hissing]

27:27.617 --> 27:30.218
Scissors.

27:32.054 --> 27:33.889
And done.

27:33.891 --> 27:35.990
How's he doing, Sharpe?

27:35.992 --> 27:39.294
He's better.
Baseline is still rocky, though.

27:39.296 --> 27:41.262
Satting at 80. BP is still low.

27:41.264 --> 27:42.964
He's still alive.

27:42.966 --> 27:45.833
Okay, let's close him up
and get him into the ICU.

27:45.835 --> 27:47.001
Nice work, everybody.

27:47.003 --> 27:49.437
Good job, Dr. Reid.

28:01.883 --> 28:04.418
Hey.

28:04.420 --> 28:08.155
Hey. Can you help me?

28:08.157 --> 28:11.759
Um... You're okay.

28:13.394 --> 28:17.097
What's happening to me?
Am I invisible, like a ghost?

28:17.099 --> 28:18.165
You could say that.

28:18.167 --> 28:19.934
But you can see me.

28:19.936 --> 28:22.436
You're a little hard to miss, no offense.

28:24.439 --> 28:25.605
Prison for life.

28:25.607 --> 28:27.941
For what?

28:27.943 --> 28:30.043
It's a long story.

28:30.045 --> 28:31.211
I see.

28:31.213 --> 28:34.181
No, you don't. I'm-I'm innocent.

- Hey.
- Hey.

40:13.516 --> 40:15.049
Please tell me that he's still awake.

40:15.051 --> 40:16.451
No, he's fast asleep.

40:16.453 --> 40:17.385
Oh.

40:17.387 --> 40:18.653
Hello to you, too, beautiful.

40:18.655 --> 40:19.821
[laughs]

40:21.556 --> 40:23.223
But there is some good
news to go with the bad.

40:23.225 --> 40:24.825
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:24.827 --> 40:26.626
Shahir's funding came through.

40:26.628 --> 40:28.928
I guess I'm getting into the brain game.

40:29.864 --> 40:31.030
That's great. Cheers.

40:31.032 --> 40:33.600
Mm-hmm.

40:33.602 --> 40:35.635
You know, I don't think I've
ever been so happy to be home.

40:35.637 --> 40:38.271
Which is why I...

40:38.273 --> 40:40.507
I kind of decided something today.

40:40.509 --> 40:41.875
Okay.

40:41.877 --> 40:43.943
Um...

40:43.945 --> 40:47.312
I-I don't want to do the paternity test.

40:47.314 --> 40:49.047
What?

40:49.049 --> 40:51.751
I don't care if he's mine
so long as he's yours.

40:51.753 --> 40:53.786
<i>Ours.</i>

40:53.788 --> 40:57.690
If he's yours, he's ours.

40:57.692 --> 40:59.492
If it was a kangaroo, I'd raise him.

40:59.494 --> 41:03.095
Charlie, you deserve to know.

41:03.097 --> 41:06.098
Mm, not if I don't care.

41:06.100 --> 41:07.533
[inhales deeply]

41:07.535 --> 41:11.169
And I think you deserve
someone who doesn't care.

41:12.572 --> 41:14.540
So does Luke.

41:15.675 --> 41:17.643
Do you have any idea how much I love you?

41:17.645 --> 41:19.845
[laughs]

41:21.014 --> 41:23.015
[baby crying]

41:23.017 --> 41:24.149
- Wait.
- What?

41:24.151 --> 41:25.617
- Listen.
- No. What?

41:25.619 --> 41:26.919
He's awake. I'm just gonna go check on him.

41:26.921 --> 41:27.953
No, no, no, no, no. No, no.

41:27.955 --> 41:29.421
I haven't seen him all day.

41:29.423 --> 41:32.291
No, sweetheart, you go in there,
you're not coming out. Okay?

41:32.293 --> 41:34.092
You can go see him in a little bit,

41:34.094 --> 41:35.193
but we kind of have

41:35.195 --> 41:37.129
some unfinished business from this morning

41:37.131 --> 41:39.197
- that I'd like to attend to.
- [laughs]

41:39.199 --> 41:43.501
I'll go look after him, and you stay here.

41:43.503 --> 41:47.105
When I get back... be naked.

41:47.107 --> 41:48.873
Sir, yes, sir.

41:48.875 --> 41:50.875
[baby coos]

41:50.877 --> 41:52.109
Hey!

41:52.111 --> 41:55.780
What are you doing up?

41:55.782 --> 41:57.549
What are you doing up? Hey.

41:57.551 --> 42:01.453
I really need you to go to sleep,
like, right now.

42:01.455 --> 42:02.852
Charlie.

42:03.692 --> 42:04.911
The medical examiner who

42:04.961 --> 42:06.586
- testified against me.
- What the hell are you doing in my house?

42:06.676 --> 42:08.225
He lied under oath.

42:08.227 --> 42:09.861
- You can't be here.
- The prosecution's case rested

42:09.863 --> 42:11.062
almost entirely in Dwyer's favor.

42:11.064 --> 42:12.129
Hey!

42:12.131 --> 42:14.031
This isn't the way this works, okay?

42:14.299 --> 42:17.669
- You know bones.
- Help me prove that Dwyer lied.

42:17.671 --> 42:20.605
Please. You're my last chance.

42:20.607 --> 42:21.773
Charlie?

42:23.140 --> 42:24.608
Hey, everything okay?

42:24.610 --> 42:25.609
Yeah.

42:25.611 --> 42:27.210
- There's my little guy.
- Yeah.

42:27.212 --> 42:28.612
[baby coos]

42:28.614 --> 42:29.980
Hi.

42:29.982 --> 42:32.616
Yeah, you want to come to mommy?

42:33.105 --> 42:34.751
Yeah.

42:34.753 --> 42:36.251
Yeah.
