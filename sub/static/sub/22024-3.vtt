you can copy onto any deVIce.

00:28.160 --> 00:29.582
It gives you access
to the Dark net.

01:20.040 --> 01:23.043
We can finish the build
ourselves. Shape it
however we want.

01:23.110 --> 01:25.977
I know, love, but we agreed.

01:26.050 --> 01:29.611
Sweetheart. We're not getting
any younger. And if we want to
have two kids...

01:29.690 --> 01:31.442
We could change the world
with this.

01:31.520 --> 01:34.353
We still will, love. Just...

That's all.

Milla, come on.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.861
We agreed...

01:48.940 --> 01:51.261

03:06.580 --> 03:08.775
Thank you,
it was beautiful.
Thank you.

03:14.290 --> 03:15.552
Hi, there.

03:17.490 --> 03:19.958
Um...

03:20.030 --> 03:25.821
Dad and I, we'd fish a lot.
It was... kind of our thing,
I guess.

03:25.900 --> 03:26.969
And...

03:29.370 --> 03:31.759
So, one time, when I was
very young,

03:31.840 --> 03:34.434
I must have_ been
eight or nine,

03:34.510 --> 03:38.344
we were staying in this cabin
on Lake Okeechobee.

03:38.410 --> 03:40.742
And we were
out on the dock,
my dad and I,

03:40.820 --> 03:43.288
and I reeled in
this two-foot pike.

03:43.350 --> 03:46.319
If you don't know,
pike are really ugly fish.

03:46.390 --> 03:49.723
They're bony,
they're skinny, ugly.

03:49.790 --> 03:53.897
Anyway, it was the first fish
I ever reeled in by myself,

03:53.960 --> 03:57.361
so I was ecstatic.
I was very, very,
very pleased,

03:57.430 --> 04:01.196
and I really wanted to eat it.

04:01.270 --> 04:04.000
My mom is less than thrilled
because she's gonna have
to cook it

04:04.070 --> 04:08.837
And so She's explaining to me
that after it's cleaned
and deboned,

04:08.910 --> 04:10.901
there's gonna be
no meat left to eat,

04:10.980 --> 04:14.347
but I didn't want
to hear it. I was determined
to eat that fish.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.014
So, dinner was served,

04:17.090 --> 04:20.412
and I had it in front of me,
and I took my first bite,

04:20.490 --> 04:25.257
and it tasted awful.
Just really, really bad.

04:26.260 --> 04:28.091
Man, I was disappointed,

04:28.160 --> 04:31.197
and my dad
could see that.

04:31.270 --> 04:36.298
He reached over,
and he took a bite,
and he...

04:36.370 --> 04:39.737
He was, I mean,
really, really tasting it.

04:39.810 --> 04:44.201
I mean, closing his eyes,
and absorbing all the flavors,

04:44.280 --> 04:45.941
and he opens his eyes
and he says,

04:46.010 --> 04:50.185
"Wow, this is
the most amazing,
delicious fish

04:50.250 --> 04:52.047
"I've ever put in
my mouth!"

04:53.290 --> 04:55.110
Slaps me on the back.

04:55.190 --> 04:58.159
And I didn't
believe him,

04:58.230 --> 05:03.918
but, uh, still really
nice to hear, you know.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.195
And everywhere we went
for the rest of the weekend,

05:06.270 --> 05:09.899
he'd tell anyone who'd listen
about this delicious fish
that his son caught.

05:12.410 --> 05:14.435
And...

05:14.510 --> 05:17.149
I think that was my dad
in a nutshell.

05:17.210 --> 05:20.373
He was always trying to make
those around him feel good,

05:21.250 --> 05:22.888
didn't matter
who they were,

05:22.950 --> 05:28.058
whether they were
a complete stranger
or his only son.

05:38.300 --> 05:39.324
I'm so sorry.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.061

It means a lot.

it could've been Nicholas?
Mmm.

of the timing
but they let him go.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.966

I really think that
this could be not only
the new Dark net,

22:45.960 --> 22:47.598
I think it could be

22:49.900 --> 22:51.561

That's, um, kind of what
we're already doing.

gonna do when your network

all that data?

lends storage Space.

about you, that you're not
quite yourself,

27:16.800 --> 27:21.567

to steer clear for a bit

some things. Some things
that I'm not proud of.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.979
But I want you to know
it has no bearing on
how I feel about you

28:05.050 --> 28:07.041

for that matter.

to tell you that
in person.

than any man
I've ever met.

very touching.

28:59.030 --> 29:01.590

his sword down like that.

Well, thank you.

29:12.480 --> 29:14.209

says the bad things
at a funeral, right?

Mm-hmm.

29:22.590 --> 29:24.023
I think...

29:25.730 --> 29:28.619
I think I even used
the word "w_hore"
at one pOInt.

In the eulogy?

29:29.900 --> 29:31.390

plenty more
I could've said.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.760
So. ..
(CLEARS THROAT)

29:36.840 --> 29:38.467
I know about
the investigation.

29:40.310 --> 29:41.800
Yeah, uh...

29:41.880 --> 29:43.233
Good. Let's talk
about that.

29:43.310 --> 29:46.677
That's actually bullshit.
That's gonna be cleared up.

29:46.750 --> 29:51.813
We're fine. I mean,
rich white guys,
we don't go to jail.

29:54.860 --> 29:58.580
Well, I imagine, uh,
you have a little
experience with that.

29:58.660 --> 30:00.252
Right? Please don't
take offense.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.195
The only thing
that offends me, son,

30:05.930 --> 30:07.227
is dishonesty.

30:07.300 --> 30:10.497
Okay. Well...
(CLEARING THROAT)

30:10.570 --> 30:13.835
Then let me just say
that I didn't call you
to share stories,

30:13.910 --> 30:15.275
as delightful
as it sounds.

30:15.340 --> 30:17.808
That part was
dishonest of me.

30:22.380 --> 30:23.369
Okay.

30:23.950 --> 30:25.042
So hit me.

30:25.120 --> 30:28.283
Well, first of all,
you and my dad,

30:28.360 --> 30:31.727
I know what you guys
were doing back then.

30:31.790 --> 30:34.520
Well, if you didn't,
you'd have to be
pretty thick.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.022
Fair enough.

30:36.100 --> 30:37.727
So I would imagine

30:37.800 --> 30:40.860
that it's been
pretty difficult, the last
17 years or so

30:40.940 --> 30:44.364
to get back to where
you were before
the tech bubble burst.

30:44.440 --> 30:48.479
What if I told you
there's a new tech frontier
on the horizon?

30:48.540 --> 30:51.077
A new Dark net completely
separate from Tor.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.607
It's its own software.
It's on its
own network.

30:53.680 --> 30:56.843
Goods and services
can be bought or sold,
information exchanged,

30:56.920 --> 31:00.742
political uprisings
orchestrated. All securely.
All anonymously.

31:00.820 --> 31:04.881
It's free from government
interference. It's free
from corporatization.

31:04.960 --> 31:08.794
This network is controlled
by myself and two other
very smart people.

31:08.860 --> 31:11.294
And what if I was
to tell you that

31:12.230 --> 31:13.822
we're not even
financed yet,

31:13.900 --> 31:17.336
but we have
a faster growth rate
right now than Tor.

31:19.140 --> 31:20.903
I'd say that
was impossible.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.002
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.945
I mean, unless...

31:25.010 --> 31:27.478
Unless you got some
government agency

31:27.550 --> 31:30.178
or at least a massive
corporation behind you.

31:30.250 --> 31:31.740
See, you don't
need those things.

31:31.820 --> 31:33.287
Not when you have
my secret weapon.

31:35.920 --> 31:38.286
RANCE: The Albanians
might do it.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.351
You can call
my guy in China.

31:40.430 --> 31:42.489
Nah, fuck that.
He's too safe.

31:42.560 --> 31:44.118
IZZY: It's zero risk
for them.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.794
As long as you connect us,
rent them as nodes,

31:46.870 --> 31:48.132
maybe they'll
do it for free.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.839
Jesus Christ,
and you want
five hops?

31:50.900 --> 31:52.800
Maybe Six.

31:52.870 --> 31:54.735
Six hops.
Different countries.

31:54.810 --> 31:58.405
Impossible to trace.
I mean, that's the safest
network ever built.

31:58.480 --> 31:59.447
Literally.

31:59.510 --> 32:02.115
The encryption's
gonna be a beast.

32:02.180 --> 32:04.580
Slow as southern balls.

32:04.650 --> 32:07.687
You just need to have
the right Cipher.

32:07.750 --> 32:11.425
RANCE: What, you're gonna
built that too while you're
working on the code?

32:12.260 --> 32:13.682
I bet Stella
could do it.

32:13.760 --> 32:14.988
I'll find someone.

32:16.130 --> 32:17.392
RANCE: You talk to her?

32:17.800 --> 32:18.789
Huh?

32:18.870 --> 32:20.360
Stella.

32:20.430 --> 32:23.069
I said She'd do
a great job
with your cipher.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.902
Nah. Uh-uh.

32:25.970 --> 32:28.279
What's up
with her aanay?

32:28.340 --> 32:31.844
I heard She turned down
some big job at Raytheon.

32:31.910 --> 32:33.002
Heard She's
getting married...

32:33.080 --> 32:34.274
She's not
gonna do it.

32:34.980 --> 32:36.345
Come on, Queen.

32:37.380 --> 32:39.109
She's not gonna
do it, okay?

32:39.190 --> 32:41.317
So, I'll find someone.

32:41.390 --> 32:43.415
That's fine. Your call.

32:43.490 --> 32:45.958
Just gonna need
half my money up front.

32:46.030 --> 32:47.054
I can't do that.

32:47.130 --> 32:48.825
RANCE: Cool.

32:48.900 --> 32:52.028
You Shouldn't have problem
finding somebody else
to work for you.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.692
Dude, Rance,
come on.

32:53.770 --> 32:56.432
Maybe we can work out
some sort of stake.

32:56.500 --> 32:59.207
Company's gonna be
printing cash
once we launch.

32:59.270 --> 33:01.602
So just like
GenCoin, right?

33:02.480 --> 33:03.936
It's not like
I cut you out.

33:04.010 --> 33:06.046
I worked for you
for three months,

33:06.110 --> 33:07.702
moonlighting for free.

33:08.880 --> 33:09.949
You screwed me, bitch.

33:10.020 --> 33:11.339
I got screwed.

33:11.420 --> 33:13.388
Rance, had it not been
stolen from me,

33:13.450 --> 33:15.486
we'd be sharing a nice
little office right now.

33:17.160 --> 33:22.291
You are so good
with promises

33:23.860 --> 33:26.067
like it's your
favorite part.

33:27.070 --> 33:28.662
Follow up,
not so much.

33:31.740 --> 33:33.162
I'll absorb your debts.

33:34.940 --> 33:39.206
Just put me in contact
with whoever you owe
and I will take over.

33:39.950 --> 33:41.144
Everything.

33:43.220 --> 33:44.710
I don't know if
you'd wanna do that.

33:50.860 --> 33:52.054
Hmm.

33:53.030 --> 33:54.292
IZZY: Is that a yes?

33:58.970 --> 34:00.164

in what is best
for Araknet,

41:38.860 --> 41:40.851
and if partnering
with them
is what's best,

41:40.930 --> 41:43.125
we should strongly
consider that.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.589
I'm gonna make
these decisions.
That was the deal.

41:45.670 --> 41:46.819
Pretty sure that's
the deal we made.

41:46.900 --> 41:48.765
Okay.
Okay. I'm gonna
answer this.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.091
Hope you stick around.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.636
Hello?
NICK: Hi!

41:53.710 --> 41:55.701
Hi, you guys.
Can you see us?

41:55.780 --> 41:57.600
Yeah, we can see you.
Can you see us?

41:57.680 --> 41:59.944
Yeah, we can. Looks
dark out there already.

42:00.010 --> 42:03.673
Yeah. You know,
it's 5:30 in the evening
here, so...

42:04.250 --> 42:05.979
That's wild.

42:06.050 --> 42:08.553
This is Ronald,
this is Izzy,
and I'm Nick.

42:08.620 --> 42:13.057
I'm Joni. This is my wife
and research partner, Milla.

42:13.130 --> 42:14.757
Hello.

42:14.830 --> 42:16.422
NICK: Nice to meet you.
Thank you so much
for hopping on with us.

42:16.500 --> 42:18.320
Yeah, of course.

42:18.400 --> 42:20.868
So, we were doing a little
research and we _came
across your prOJect.

42:21.870 --> 42:23.735
Now, did you guys
write it?

42:23.800 --> 42:28.669
Yeah. So, Joni authored
the browser program
and I did the encryption.

42:28.740 --> 42:32.278
Yeah, I thinkI read about
you guys a couple years ago
on the Wiretap Blog.

42:32.350 --> 42:33.601
MILLA: Yeah.

42:33.680 --> 42:36.615
Yeah. They do an article.
It was very nice.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.238
Yeah. It was very nice.

42:38.320 --> 42:41.414
And we are a fan
of your work,
too, Isabelle.

42:41.490 --> 42:45.586
Yeah, we took a look
at your GenCoin code,
and it's amazing.

42:45.660 --> 42:47.525
Yeah. Thank you.

42:47.590 --> 42:50.627
MILLA: Why did you decide
to leave? If you don't
mind us asking.

42:50.700 --> 42:52.998
I'm just into
new things now.

42:53.070 --> 42:55.368
NICK: Anyway, we don't
wanna take up too much
of your time.

42:55.440 --> 42:58.603
We just wanted to
introduce ourselves and,

42:58.670 --> 43:00.262
you know, maybe talk
a little Shop.

43:00.340 --> 43:02.604
See how things are going
on your project, how far
along you are...

43:02.680 --> 43:03.931
Yeah, yeah, of course.

43:04.580 --> 43:06.377
But...

43:06.450 --> 43:09.442
Yeah, so, we would
really like to talk
about Guizer but...

43:09.520 --> 43:12.444
But we can't really
discuss any details
is the thing.

43:12.520 --> 43:16.058
MILLA: Yeah, we just
Signed an NDA with
someone, 'cause...

43:16.120 --> 43:18.111
JONI: (IN SWEDISH)
We can tell them
about the sale, though.

43:18.190 --> 43:20.021
MILLA : (IN SWEDISH)
Can we?

43:20.090 --> 43:21.728
NICK: We wouldn't wanna
get you in trouble
or anything.

43:21.800 --> 43:25.292
Are they out there already?
The company.

43:25.370 --> 43:28.965
JONI: Yeah. It's actually
a real coincidence.

43:29.040 --> 43:30.792
Well, maybe
not really.
No.

43:30.870 --> 43:33.600
I mean, come on.
It's one of the biggest
there is. So...

43:33.670 --> 43:35.331
IZZY: What's
the coincidence?

43:35.410 --> 43:36.638
Who did you sell to?

43:38.240 --> 43:39.969
Who did you sell to?

43:40.050 --> 43:42.871
Axis. Your friend.
Alex Bell.

43:42.950 --> 43:45.316
Yeah. Isn't that wild?

43:54.190 --> 43:55.225
JONI: Hello?

44:04.600 --> 44:05.760
Fuck!
