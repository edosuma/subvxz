00:05.421 --> 00:06.992
Big for a tracker, isn't it?

00:06.993 --> 00:10.562
But they also collect data from the
anomalies in a particularly com system.

00:10.563 --> 00:14.359
With these in, I can monitor and record
everything you say while out in the field.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.825
- Is that necessary?
- Yeah, of course.

00:17.780 --> 00:21.463
If anyone gets into trouble,
everyone will know about it immediately.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.555
Are these only
on during alert?

00:23.560 --> 00:26.461
Philipp and Lester want them
on all the time just in case.

00:26.770 --> 00:27.927
All right.

00:28.217 --> 00:30.558
The range of them is
amazing but unfortunately,

00:30.559 --> 00:32.899
they will stop feeding back
if you go through an anomaly.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.696
How is that even an issue?

00:34.697 --> 00:37.200
Policy's strict. No one goes
through, not for any reason.

00:37.201 --> 00:40.746
- No. - Everyone has been
briefed. Everyone knows the rules.

00:41.110 --> 00:42.764
I go and hand these out.

00:46.983 --> 00:49.913
I wasn't suggesting
anyone should go through.

00:50.968 --> 00:52.923
He knows.
He'll calm down.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.221
Oh. Hey.

01:00.335 --> 01:03.652
Look, I'm so sorry about earlier.

01:03.653 --> 01:05.277
It literally took
20 minutes for me...

01:05.278 --> 01:07.713
...to extract my foot from my
mouth. May I tell everthing?

01:07.714 --> 01:08.777
Forget it.

01:08.778 --> 01:11.540
I completely overreacted.
I'm sorry.

01:11.855 --> 01:15.392
Look, I know you've been asking
around about the old team.

01:15.393 --> 01:16.607
That's ok.

01:16.608 --> 01:19.168
You can ask me anything you like.
I don't bite your head off.

01:21.470 --> 01:24.242
I know it's probably classified
and everything about...

01:24.243 --> 01:26.804
There is something
I don't understand.

01:29.975 --> 01:34.017
I thought Danny and the others followed
Helen Cutter to the future.

01:34.018 --> 01:35.168
But I've...

01:35.500 --> 01:39.426
I've heard people talking about
the past... about early humans...

01:41.268 --> 01:43.461
When the others didn't return,

01:43.765 --> 01:46.935
Sarah deciphered something
in Helen Cutter's diary.

01:47.255 --> 01:50.040
Side 333,
the Rift Valley.

01:50.562 --> 01:53.094
It's where the human ancestors evolved.

01:54.300 --> 01:55.530
Sarah was always certain...

01:55.531 --> 01:59.222
...that Helen Cutter was gonna try
and find her way back there somehow.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.899
- But why?
- To murder them.

02:02.431 --> 02:05.809
To wipe out the human race
before it even started.

02:06.110 --> 02:10.084
That woman was seriously
messed up. But...

02:10.600 --> 02:13.131
But she failed, right?
We're still here.

02:13.965 --> 02:16.728
Yeah.
It seems like it.

02:16.729 --> 02:18.743
Your friends figured it out.

02:18.744 --> 02:20.279
They stopped her.

02:25.062 --> 02:27.595
Yeah. Yeah.
I made it.

02:27.819 --> 02:29.008
Hang on.

02:36.701 --> 02:40.520
Sorry, I missed the call time.
I'm gonna do another bittiest girl.

02:40.521 --> 02:41.885
Sounds messy.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.453
Best one I've had in a long time.

02:44.933 --> 02:47.420
- The team was fantastic.
- Good to hear.

02:47.629 --> 02:50.119
<i>Becker is a pain in the rear
but he's good at what he does.</i>

02:51.920 --> 02:53.377
What?
What's wrong?

02:53.378 --> 02:57.555
Matthew, these people will become
your friends. It's only natural.

02:57.556 --> 03:00.190
<i>I've been working
towards for ten years.</i>

03:00.191 --> 03:02.950
I'm not going to get too close.
I'm not going to take any chances.

03:02.951 --> 03:06.139
Forgive me.
It's only that sometimes,

03:06.545 --> 03:09.685
I think this is impossible, sometimes
I think we're going to fail.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.063
We won't.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.560
But we're running out of time!
