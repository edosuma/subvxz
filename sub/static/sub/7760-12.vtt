- FUNNY, I'VE ALWAYS
HEARD PALM SPRINGS

10:04.672 --> 10:06.606
WAS A VERY GOOD PLACE.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.144
- HOW DID YOU KNOW?

10:11.178 --> 10:13.280
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW I KNOW.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.889
WELL, I HOPE
YOU HAD FUN.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.260
- IF YOU CALL
A CIRCUIT PARTY

10:27.294 --> 10:30.731
WITH 20,000 TWEAKED-OUT FAGS
FUN.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.265
- SO WHY DID YOU GO?

10:32.299 --> 10:33.400
- [sighs]

10:33.433 --> 10:36.003
BECAUSE I'D NEVER BEEN BEFORE.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.371
SINCE I HAD THE TIME.
- AND THE MONEY.

10:39.807 --> 10:41.942
MUST HAVE COST A PRETTY PENNY,

10:41.975 --> 10:44.211
LEAVING AT THE LAST MINUTE.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.446
WHERE'D IT COME FROM, HMM?

10:46.479 --> 10:49.416
AND BEFORE YOU SAY THE CHECK
YOUR GRANNY GAVE YOU

10:49.449 --> 10:51.418
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY,

10:51.451 --> 10:53.821
HOW ABOUT GUS' COLLEGE FUND?

10:53.854 --> 10:58.425
THE ONE MEL AND LINZ
ENTRUSTED YOU WITH?

10:58.458 --> 11:02.429
HOW COULD YOU STEAL MONEY
FROM A BABY?

11:02.462 --> 11:03.897
- IT'S NOT LIKE
HE'S GOING TO NEED IT

11:03.931 --> 11:07.234
FOR ANOTHER 15 YEARS.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.436
ANYWAY, I DIDN'T STEAL IT.
I BORROWED IT.

11:09.469 --> 11:12.172
I HAVE EVERY INTENTION OF
PAYING THEM BACK, WITH INTEREST.

11:12.205 --> 11:15.042
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO REPAY THEM.

11:15.075 --> 11:18.111
I ALREADY REPLACED IT.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.447
EVERY CENT.

11:20.480 --> 11:23.083
WITH THE MONEY
I WAS GOING TO USE

11:23.116 --> 11:26.820
TO BUY THAT OVEN.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.321
- YOU DID THAT FOR ME?

11:28.355 --> 11:30.858
- NOT JUST FOR YOU.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.926
FOR THEM.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.127
SO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO LOOK

11:34.161 --> 11:35.963
AT SOMEONE
THEY LOVE AND TRUST

11:35.996 --> 11:40.167
AND REALIZE HE'S BECOME
A THIEF AND A LIAR.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.511
- SO YOU AND BRIAN
EVER FUCK?

11:51.544 --> 11:53.213
- WHAT?

11:53.246 --> 11:55.816
- I SAID, DID YOU AND BRIAN
EVER FUCK?

11:55.849 --> 11:56.950
- NO, WE NEVER--

11:56.984 --> 11:58.018
- I DIDN'T THINK SO.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.087
YOU'RE NOT HIS TYPE.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.755
- WELL, NEITHER ARE YOU.

12:01.789 --> 12:02.956
- WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.357
- HEY, WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

12:04.391 --> 12:06.960
- SOMEONE'S GOT
A SCHOOLBOY CRUSH.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.495
- I DO NOT.
- OH, CHRIST.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.230
THAT'S ALL WE NEED.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.431
- JUST STAY AWAY FROM HIM,
OKAY?

12:11.464 --> 12:13.366
HE'S A BAD INFLUENCE.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.037
- I MADE YOU
A TRIPLE-SCOOP PISTACHIO SUNDAE,

12:17.070 --> 12:20.173
EXTRA HOT FUDGE,
AND SPRINKLES ON TOP.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.975
- WHAT THE FUCK
DO I LOOK LIKE?

12:22.009 --> 12:23.010
A NINE-YEAR-OLD?

12:23.043 --> 12:25.012
- NO, HONEY, YOU DON'T.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.114
YOU LOOK LIKE
A SMART-ASS LITTLE TWERP

12:27.147 --> 12:29.749
WHO COULD USE
SOME MANNERS.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.121
NOW HOW ABOUT
A NICE, BIG THANK-YOU?

12:34.154 --> 12:35.856
- THANK YOU.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.257
- THAT'S BETTER.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.426
- OH, I GOT IT.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.394
- WAIT A MINUTE,
AREN'T YOU GOING TO EAT IT?

12:41.428 --> 12:44.331
- I HATE PISTACHIO.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.145
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

12:58.178 --> 12:59.546
- NOTHING.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.049
- DO YOU KNOW HIM?
JASON KEMP?

13:02.082 --> 13:03.416
- KIND OF.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.285
- DID HE HUSTLE TOO?

13:05.318 --> 13:07.087
- HE WAS JUST STARTING OUT.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.289
HE HADN'T LEARNED THE ROPES,
LIKE, WHO TO GO WITH,

13:09.322 --> 13:13.293
WHO NOT TO, MAKE SURE
YOU COLLECT UP FRONT.

13:13.326 --> 13:16.329
I'VE GOTTA GET TO WORK.

13:16.363 --> 13:19.466
- HOLD IT.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.435
IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE NIGHT HE DIED,

13:22.469 --> 13:24.304
WHO HE WAS WITH,
WHERE HE WAS,

13:24.337 --> 13:25.939
YOU OWE IT TO HIM
TO SAY SOMETHING.

13:25.973 --> 13:26.940
- HE'S DEAD.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.076
I DON'T OWE HIM SHIT.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.378
ANYWAY, HE OWED ME 50 BUCKS.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.380
- 50 BUCKS?

13:33.413 --> 13:36.316
[bills rustling]

13:36.349 --> 13:37.317
THERE.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.452
THERE!

13:39.486 --> 13:41.989
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.193
- THE NIGHT HE GOT KILLED,
WE WERE AT A BAR.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.929
HE WENT OFF
WITH THIS TRICK.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.597
I WARNED HIM NOT TO,

13:50.630 --> 13:52.866
BUT JASON
NEEDED THE MONEY,

13:52.900 --> 13:55.335
SO HE WENT ANYWAY.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.337
THAT'S THE LAST TIME
I SAW HIM.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.506
- ANY IDEA
WHO THIS GUY WAS?

14:02.109 --> 14:04.377
- WHY DIDN'T YOU GO
TO THE POLICE?

14:04.411 --> 14:05.979
- YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.115
THEY'D NEVER ARREST HIM.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.217
- WHY NOT?

14:10.250 --> 14:13.153
- YOU FIGURE IT OUT.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.023
[door closes]

14:16.056 --> 14:17.657
- A COP?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.227
- YOU'RE SAYING A COP
KILLED JASON KEMP.

14:20.260 --> 14:23.096
- I'M SAYING THAT THIS KID
SAW HIM LEAVE A HUSTLER BAR

14:23.130 --> 14:24.497
AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING

14:24.531 --> 14:26.633
WITH SOMEONE
THAT HE KNEW WAS A COP.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.368
AND A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER,

14:28.401 --> 14:31.104
THE BOY TURNS UP DEAD
IN A DUMPSTER.

14:31.138 --> 14:34.674
- WHY SHOULD I TAKE
THE WORD OF SOME HUSTLER?

14:34.707 --> 14:35.976
- WHY SHOULDN'T YOU?

14:36.009 --> 14:38.145
- ANY NUMBER OF REASONS.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.513
THEY'RE LIARS, THIEVES,

14:40.547 --> 14:42.983
DRUG DEALERS, ADDICTS.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.517
JUST BECAUSE YOUR SON
AND HIS FRIEND

14:44.551 --> 14:46.386
HAVE A SOFT SPOT
IN THEIR HEARTS--

14:46.419 --> 14:47.988
MAKE THAT THEIR HEADS--

14:48.021 --> 14:49.456
AND HAVE TAKEN ONE IN

14:49.489 --> 14:51.524
DOESN'T MEAN
HE'S TO BE BELIEVED OR TRUSTED.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.260
- WELL, YOU COULD
AT LEAST TALK TO HIM.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.128
GET A FUCKING DESCRIPTION.

14:55.162 --> 14:56.997
- OF SOMEONE
HE HAS IT IN FOR?

14:57.030 --> 14:59.132
WHO CHASED HIM
OFF HIS CORNER?

14:59.166 --> 15:02.002
HARASSED ONE OF HIS TRICKS?
ARRESTED HIM FOR PROSTITUTION?

15:02.035 --> 15:04.271
- IT'S A FUCKING LEAD, CARL.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.173
CAN'T YOU
AT LEAST FOLLOW IT?

15:06.206 --> 15:09.209
- IT'S OFF MY DESK.
COLD-CASED.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.443
- BY WHO?

15:10.477 --> 15:13.680
- HIGHER-UPS.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.215
- YOU MEAN STOCKWELL?

15:15.248 --> 15:17.284
- THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.687
- WHOEVER KILLED JASON KEMP
IS MY BUSINESS.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.289
SO YOU CAN TELL
YOUR HIGHER-UPS

15:22.322 --> 15:23.690
TO GET THEIR ASSES DOWN HERE

15:23.723 --> 15:26.359
AND PUT IT BACK
ON THE FRONT BURNER.

15:26.393 --> 15:30.063
- I'M SORRY, MRS. NOVOTNY,

15:30.097 --> 15:32.732
BUT I DON'T TAKE
MY ORDERS FROM YOU.

15:32.765 --> 15:38.471
[indistinct chatter]

15:40.107 --> 15:41.574
- HE SAID
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING,

15:41.608 --> 15:45.712
BUT HE HAD THAT RINGS-OF-SATURN
LOOK UNDER HIS EYES.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.314
- CRYSTAL?

15:47.347 --> 15:48.748
- WELL, WE ALL KNOW
THE DRUG OF CHOICE

15:48.781 --> 15:51.084
AT THE WHITE PARTY
AIN'T ADVIL.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.720
- I CAN'T IMAGINE TED--

15:53.753 --> 15:55.322
I MEAN, YOU'D THINK
HE'D KNOW BETTER

15:55.355 --> 15:56.990
THAN TO MESS WITH THAT SHIT.

15:57.024 --> 16:00.593
- I COULD'VE KILLED HIM.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.063
BUT HE LOOKED SO TIRED,
SO PAINED,

16:03.096 --> 16:05.365
I JUST WANTED TO HUG HIM
AND TELL HIM

16:05.398 --> 16:07.567
EVERYTHING IS GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

16:10.137 --> 16:13.006
- HEY, GUYS.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.641
- TEDDY.

16:14.674 --> 16:17.377
- HI, MICHAEL.
- ARE YOU OKAY?

16:17.410 --> 16:19.012
LISTEN, IF YOU EVER WANT
TO GET TOGETHER

16:19.046 --> 16:21.348
AND JUST TALK THINGS OUT...
- THANKS, MICHAEL.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.516
BUT I'VE HAD
MY LOST WEEKEND,

16:23.550 --> 16:26.386
AND IT'S OVER.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.021
I CAN NOW OFFICIALLY SAY
I'VE BEEN

16:28.055 --> 16:30.990
TO MY FIRST WHITE PARTY
AND MY LAST.

16:36.129 --> 16:39.066
- I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

16:45.205 --> 16:48.708
- ANOTHER COSMO, PLEASE.

16:48.741 --> 16:51.678
- I'LL HAVE A CLUB SODA.

16:53.813 --> 16:56.283
I REALLY MUST HAVE CRASHED.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.522
WOKE UP
AND YOU WEREN'T THERE.

17:02.555 --> 17:05.258
- YEAH, WELL,
I NEEDED TO GET AWAY.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.560
I'M SURE
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

17:11.164 --> 17:13.566
I'M GLAD
YOU GOT SOME REST.

17:22.575 --> 17:23.810
- EM...

17:23.843 --> 17:25.278
- THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY.

17:25.312 --> 17:27.314
IT'S PERFECTLY LOGICAL.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.816
ONE DAY, YOU'RE TED SCHMIDT,
MY BEST FRIEND

17:29.849 --> 17:31.418
AND THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,
AND THE NEXT DAY,

17:31.451 --> 17:33.553
YOU'RE TED SCHMIDT,
CIRCUIT BOY.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.288
AND PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU DIDN'T DO ANY DRUGS

17:35.322 --> 17:38.191
BECAUSE IT IS OBVIOUS
YOU DID.

17:39.726 --> 17:44.297
- OKAY, I TRIED IT.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.466
I'M A LATE BLOOMER.

17:46.499 --> 17:47.834
I MEAN, I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
SEX WITH ANOTHER GUY

17:47.867 --> 17:50.170
UNTIL I WAS 21.

17:50.203 --> 17:55.442
- WELL, I'M SURE YOU MADE UP
FOR IT THIS WEEKEND.

17:55.475 --> 17:58.578
- LOOK, IT'S OVER AND DONE.

17:58.611 --> 18:02.349
I CHALK IT UP TO EXPERIENCE.
I MOVE ON.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.451
TOMORROW MORNING,

18:04.484 --> 18:09.456
LIFE BEGINS ANEW.

18:09.489 --> 18:12.859
YOU KNOW,
I-I WAS THINKING.

18:12.892 --> 18:15.795
MAYBE I'LL START
ANOTHER BUSINESS.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.365
YOU KNOW,
BECOME A FINANCIAL PLANNER,

18:18.398 --> 18:21.368
BUILD UP A LIST OF CLIENTS.

18:24.371 --> 18:28.341
BUT FIRST...

18:28.375 --> 18:30.277
[clears throat]

18:33.280 --> 18:36.249
I'M GOING TO GO TELL MELANIE
AND LINDSAY THE TRUTH.

18:39.386 --> 18:42.755
- THAT'S, UH...

18:42.789 --> 18:46.359
THAT'S VERY ADMIRABLE.

18:46.393 --> 18:49.529
- I JUST HOPE THEY ACCEPT
MY APOLOGY.

18:54.267 --> 18:57.504
THEN I'M GOING
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.906
I KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE
MORE THAN JUST WORDS,

18:59.939 --> 19:02.909
BUT...

19:02.942 --> 19:07.580
SOMEHOW,
I'LL FIND A WAY.

19:11.851 --> 19:12.819
[indistinct chatter]

19:12.852 --> 19:13.920
[knock on door]

19:13.953 --> 19:17.824
[men moaning]

19:17.857 --> 19:20.827
[laughter, moaning]

19:22.562 --> 19:26.466
- ANOTHER QUIET EVENING
AT THE KINNEY RESIDENCE.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.975
HELLO, EXCUSE ME.

19:36.008 --> 19:40.313
EXCUSE ME.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.881
- OH, YEAH.
- OH.

19:41.914 --> 19:42.982
- THAT'S RIGHT.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.952
- EXCUSE ME, HONEY.

19:45.985 --> 19:49.822
PARDON ME, BABY.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.991
HI.

19:52.024 --> 19:56.363
GLAD TO SEE
YOU'RE PLAYING SAFELY.

19:58.865 --> 20:02.201
DID I COME AT A BAD TIME?

20:04.871 --> 20:08.308
- NO.
BUT I DID.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.609
- WHO THE FUCK'S SHE?

20:09.642 --> 20:11.444
- THE AVON LADY.

20:11.478 --> 20:14.481
CAN'T YOU SEE
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMEONE?

20:14.514 --> 20:16.916
- WELL, I'M SORRY
TO PULL YOU AWAY,

20:16.949 --> 20:18.785
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.753
- [snorts]

20:23.390 --> 20:25.258
- THE KID
MICHAEL AND BEN TOOK IN

20:25.292 --> 20:26.759
SAID THE NIGHT
THAT JASON KEMP DIED,

20:26.793 --> 20:30.330
HE SAW HIM IN A HUSTLER BAR,
PICKING UP A COP.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.499
- AND WHAT ARE
YOU TELLING ME FOR?

20:32.532 --> 20:34.767
- YOU KNOW, IF YOU TRIED
THINKING WITH YOUR BRAIN

20:34.801 --> 20:37.470
INSTEAD OF YOUR DICK,
YOU MIGHT REALIZE

20:37.504 --> 20:38.905
THAT STOCKWELL
AND HIS CAMPAIGN

20:38.938 --> 20:41.474
COULD BE IN DEEP SHIT
IF IT TURNED OUT

20:41.508 --> 20:43.943
THAT THE KILLER WAS ONE
OF PITTSBURGH'S FINEST.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.512
- DO ME A FAVOR, DEBBIE,

20:45.545 --> 20:47.280
TELL YOUR BOYFRIEND.

20:47.314 --> 20:50.350
- HE'S NOT MY BOYFRIEND.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.652
AND I ALREADY DID,
AND HE WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.287
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO DO?

20:54.321 --> 20:55.788
- NAIL THE BASTARD!

20:55.822 --> 20:57.624
- THE ONLY PERSON
I'M INTERESTED IN NAILING

20:57.657 --> 20:59.392
IS HIM.
[slaps]

20:59.426 --> 21:02.729
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

21:04.564 --> 21:10.537
[men moaning]

21:17.444 --> 21:20.513
[both moaning]

21:20.547 --> 21:22.048
- JUST DO IT.
DO IT.

21:22.081 --> 21:23.816
- ALL RIGHT, BABY,
THEY'LL HEAR YOU IN SCRANTON.

21:23.850 --> 21:24.951
- SO WHAT IF THEY DO?

21:24.984 --> 21:26.919
OH, MY GOD.
OH!

21:26.953 --> 21:29.956
[moaning]

21:29.989 --> 21:32.392
- [pants]

21:32.425 --> 21:34.461
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

21:34.494 --> 21:36.463
- FUCK, I JUST HAVE A LOT
ON MY MIND, THAT'S ALL.

21:36.496 --> 21:40.400
IT'S...THIS COURSE
I'M TEACHING

21:40.433 --> 21:44.471
AND THIS CHAPTER
I'M--I'M STUCK ON.

21:44.504 --> 21:47.073
- THIS KID.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.675
- YEAH, YEAH.

21:48.708 --> 21:51.077
HE'S OUT THERE
ON THE STREET,

21:51.110 --> 21:52.679
TURNING TRICKS, ALL RIGHT?

21:52.712 --> 21:53.946
HOPEFULLY BEING CAREFUL.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.849
BUT WHAT IF HE PICKS UP
THE WRONG GUY?

21:56.883 --> 21:58.017
HE COULD END UP THE NEXT KID

21:58.050 --> 21:59.686
IN A DUMPSTER, MICHAEL.
- CHRIST.

21:59.719 --> 22:01.554
HE FUCKS UP OUR SEX LIFE
WHEN HE'S HERE,

22:01.588 --> 22:04.023
AND NOW HE'S FUCKING IT UP
WHEN HE'S NOT HERE.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.725
[knock on door]

22:07.994 --> 22:10.697
- OKAY, THAT'S HIM.

22:10.730 --> 22:11.864
[knock on door]

22:11.898 --> 22:13.366
- WELL, AT LEAST
EVERYONE IN SCRANTON

22:13.400 --> 22:16.102
WILL HAVE
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

22:16.135 --> 22:19.506
[chatter on TV]
[laughter]

22:19.539 --> 22:21.107
- WHERE HAVE YOU TWO BEEN?

22:21.140 --> 22:23.510
- MOVIE...

22:23.543 --> 22:25.578
AND A MATTRESS SALE.

22:25.612 --> 22:27.847
- 60% OFF.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.115
- WELL, I HOPE
IT GETS HERE SOON.

22:29.148 --> 22:30.717
LISTENING
TO THAT OLD THING SQUEAK

22:30.750 --> 22:33.786
EVERY TIME YOU TWO
GET IT ON KEEPS ME AWAKE.

22:33.820 --> 22:37.524
- MAYBE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE
YOUR EAR PRESSED TO THE WALL.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.859
- THINK I'LL GO WARM UP
THE SHEETS.

22:39.892 --> 22:41.594
- 7-KARAT GOLD OVERLAY.

22:41.628 --> 22:42.862
LOOK AT THIS SETTING,
LADIES.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.130
CAN YOU SEE THAT?

22:44.163 --> 22:45.532
COULD WE GET A LITTLE CLOSER,
RICHARD?

22:45.565 --> 22:46.899
THAT'S IT.

22:46.933 --> 22:50.870
- SO WHY ARE YOUR TITS
IN A TWIST?

22:50.903 --> 22:52.939
THEY RUN OUT OF
THAT EMPRESS ALEXANDRA BRACELET

22:52.972 --> 22:54.006
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR?

22:54.040 --> 22:55.141
- YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

22:55.174 --> 22:56.809
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.

22:56.843 --> 22:59.946
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
SUCH A BRIEF TIME.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.948
- NEVER MIND.

23:01.981 --> 23:06.018
RODNEY'S WAITING.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.654
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

23:07.687 --> 23:09.055
- I OWN THIS ONE MYSELF.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.690
IT'S UP THERE
IN MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE--

23:10.723 --> 23:11.958
- WHAT IS IT, SIS?

23:11.991 --> 23:13.893
- HE LOOKED RIGHT THROUGH ME.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.027
- WHO DID?

23:15.061 --> 23:18.164
- HORVATH.
WHO DO YOU THINK?

23:18.197 --> 23:20.767
AND HE CALLED ME
MRS. NOVOTNY,

23:20.800 --> 23:24.070
LIKE I WAS
A TOTAL STRANGER.

23:24.103 --> 23:28.775
A TOTAL FUCKING STRANGER.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.209
I HATE MEN.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.044
WHY COULDN'T I HAVE BEEN
A LESBIAN?

23:32.078 --> 23:34.681
- BECAUSE MOM WOULD'VE HAD
A HEART ATTACK

23:34.714 --> 23:36.949
IF BOTH HER KIDS WERE GAY.

23:36.983 --> 23:38.651
STUFFING THIS IN YOUR MOUTH

23:38.685 --> 23:42.955
ISN'T GOING TO MAKE YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER.

23:46.693 --> 23:48.961
- HORVATH'S LIKE
A CHEESE DOODLE.

23:48.995 --> 23:50.963
- YOU TOLD ME
HE WAS WELL-ENDOWED.

23:50.997 --> 23:53.533
- I MEAN,
YOU JUST SHOULDN'T START,

23:53.566 --> 23:56.936
'CAUSE ONCE YOU DO...

23:56.969 --> 23:58.671
ALL YOU WANT IS MORE.

23:58.705 --> 24:01.674
JUST BETTER NEVER TO HAVE
HAD ANY AT ALL THAN TO--

24:01.708 --> 24:03.142
- WE HAVE INDEED SOLD OUT.

24:03.175 --> 24:05.244
SORRY, THAT'S IT.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.546
- SHIT.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.548
THEY JUST SOLD OUT.

24:08.581 --> 24:09.682
- OH.

24:09.716 --> 24:11.584
- [crying] FUCK.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.586
- [chuckles]

24:13.620 --> 24:15.655
IT'S OKAY.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.628
- YOU BETTER WEAR SOME GLOVES
AND A SKI CAP.

24:21.661 --> 24:24.497
IT'S FREEZING OUTSIDE.

24:24.531 --> 24:28.635
OH, CHRIST.
DID I JUST SAY THAT?

24:28.668 --> 24:31.037
I SOUND LIKE MY MOTHER.
ACTUALLY, MAKE THAT YOUR MOTHER.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.839
- THANKS.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.574
- ANYTHING ELSE?

24:34.607 --> 24:37.476
- BE SURE TO WEAR
YOUR RUBBERS.

24:40.613 --> 24:41.748
WAIT UP.

24:41.781 --> 24:45.251
- NOW WHAT?

24:45.284 --> 24:48.120
[keys jingle]

24:48.154 --> 24:51.791
- THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED THIS.

24:51.824 --> 24:54.160
- I THOUGHT
YOU DIDN'T TRUST ME.

24:54.193 --> 24:57.063
- WELL, THIS WAY,
WE DON'T HAVE TO STOP

24:57.096 --> 24:59.532
WHATEVER IT IS WE'RE DOING
TO LET YOU IN.

25:19.051 --> 25:21.287
- I'M SURPRISED
YOU DID THAT.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.824
- ONCE HE'S GONE,
WE CAN ALWAYS CHANGE THE LOCK.

25:27.827 --> 25:30.797
- MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE
AN ELEGANT AFFAIR.

25:30.830 --> 25:35.301
- LONG NIGHT'S JOURNEY
INTO DAY.

25:35.334 --> 25:37.670
AH.

25:37.704 --> 25:40.239
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE.
- UGH.

25:40.272 --> 25:43.209
YEAH, I WAS HELPING DAPHNE
STUDY FOR MIDTERMS.

25:45.077 --> 25:50.116
- 20 OF PITTSBURGH'S HOTTEST,
HORNIEST HUNKS...

25:50.149 --> 25:52.652
AND DEBBIE.

25:52.685 --> 25:55.254
- WELL, I KNOW HOW MUCH
SHE WANTS TO BE A GAY MAN,

25:55.287 --> 25:57.657
BUT IS IT WISE TO ENCOURAGE HER?
- [chuckles]

25:57.690 --> 26:00.927
WELL, SHE COULDN'T WAIT
TO TELL ME THE NEWS.

26:00.960 --> 26:04.196
IT SEEMS THE LITTLEST HUSTLER
KNEW DUMPSTER BOY,

26:04.230 --> 26:07.266
SAW HIM PICKING UP A COP
THE NIGHT HE WAS MURDERED.

26:07.299 --> 26:09.335
- OH, SHIT.
- YEAH.

26:09.368 --> 26:12.138
FOR SOME REASON,

26:12.171 --> 26:16.208
SHE THOUGHT
I WOULD BE INTERESTED.

26:16.242 --> 26:19.078
- AREN'T YOU?

26:19.111 --> 26:21.948
- NO. I ALREADY TOLD YOU.
- RIGHT.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.950
YOU WANT TO HAVE
FUN, FUN, FUN

26:23.983 --> 26:27.119
TILL YOUR DADDY TAKES
YOUR FREEDOM AWAY.

26:27.153 --> 26:32.024
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,
HE ALREADY HAS.

26:32.058 --> 26:34.861
BUT IF YOU'RE CONTENT
TURNING YOUR PLACE

26:34.894 --> 26:37.363
INTO THE NEXT BACK ROOM,

26:37.396 --> 26:39.365
FINE.

26:39.398 --> 26:43.369
ONLY HOW ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP
A CLEANING LADY?

26:43.402 --> 26:46.906
- I MADE A HASTY DECISION.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.841
A POOR ONE.

26:48.875 --> 26:52.111
AND ONE FOR WHICH
I WILL ALWAYS BE ASHAMED,

26:52.144 --> 26:53.312
BUT...

26:53.345 --> 26:54.881
I...

26:54.914 --> 26:57.249
HOPE YOU CAN FIND IT
IN YOUR HEARTS

26:57.283 --> 26:58.384
TO FORGIVE ME.

26:58.417 --> 27:02.989
AND IF NOT TODAY,
THEN SOMEDAY

27:03.022 --> 27:06.192
AND THAT SOMEHOW

27:06.225 --> 27:08.294
I CAN EARN BACK YOUR LOVE

27:08.327 --> 27:11.597
AND...YOUR RESPECT.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.403
- THAT'S...

27:17.436 --> 27:19.438
VERY BRAVE OF YOU, TED,

27:19.471 --> 27:23.743
TO COME HERE AND OWN UP
TO WHAT YOU DID.

27:23.776 --> 27:25.878
DON'T YOU THINK, MEL?
- YEAH, YEAH.

27:25.912 --> 27:29.916
IT TOOK GUTS,
AND IT WAS A VERY NICE SPEECH,

27:29.949 --> 27:33.920
BUT WE'LL HAVE
TO WAIT AND SEE.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.788
- SEE WHAT?

27:35.822 --> 27:37.223
- SAYING YOU'RE SORRY
IS ONE THING.

27:37.256 --> 27:39.458
MEANING IT IS ANOTHER.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.761
- HE TOLD YOU
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

27:41.794 --> 27:45.798
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, EM.
I DON'T NEED YOU TO DEFEND ME.

27:45.832 --> 27:48.167
I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR NOT
ACCEPTING MY APOLOGY, MEL.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.102
IF I WERE YOU,

27:50.136 --> 27:51.771
I DOUBT I WOULD EITHER, SO--

27:51.804 --> 27:53.072
- SHE DIDN'T SAY
SHE DIDN'T ACCEPT IT.

27:53.105 --> 27:54.306
- ALL I'M SAYING IS,
WE'LL SEE.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.908
THAT'S ALL.

27:55.942 --> 27:57.777
- I UNDERSTAND.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.045
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?

27:59.078 --> 28:01.914
I JUST WANT TO GO USE
YOUR BATHROOM.

28:01.948 --> 28:05.184
[clears throat]

28:05.217 --> 28:07.854
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW HARD THAT WAS FOR HIM?

28:07.887 --> 28:10.189
- I KNOW. I FEEL SO BAD FOR HIM.
- WELL, I DON'T.

28:10.222 --> 28:12.324
HE'S A FUCKING DRUG USER.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.994
- THAT IS NOT TRUE.
HE TRIED IT ONCE.

28:15.027 --> 28:15.995
- COME OFF IT, EMMETT.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.363
FOR HIM TO GET TO THE POINT

28:17.396 --> 28:19.065
WHERE HE'D ACTUALLY STEAL
OUR MONEY--

28:19.098 --> 28:20.733
- HE DIDN'T STEAL IT.
HE BORROWED IT.

28:20.767 --> 28:22.201
HE WAS PLANNING
ON PUTTING IT BACK.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.803
- AND YOU BELIEVE HIM?
- DON'T YOU?

28:23.836 --> 28:25.137
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE HIS FRIENDS.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.073
- WE ARE HIS FRIENDS.
- DAMN GOOD FRIENDS.

28:27.106 --> 28:29.208
- THEN WHY CAN'T
YOU SHOW HIM THE TEENIEST,

28:29.241 --> 28:31.343
TINIEST BIT OF COMPASSION?

28:31.377 --> 28:33.212
- BECAUSE HE'D ONLY
ABUSE IT AND US.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.214
- MEL!
- THE SAME WAY HE'S ABUSING YOU.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.483
- HE IS NOT ABUSING ME.

28:37.516 --> 28:38.517
- AND WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?

28:38.550 --> 28:40.219
- HE IS COUNTING ON ME,

28:40.252 --> 28:42.354
TO BE THERE FOR HIM,
TO--TO BELIEVE IN HIM.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.390
TO HELP HIM PUT HIS LIFE
BACK IN ORDER.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.025
- COULD YOU STOP BEING
A SILLY FAGGOT

28:46.058 --> 28:49.361
AND HAVE SOME BALLS,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES?

28:49.395 --> 28:53.032
- WELL,
I MAY BE A SILLY FAGGOT,

28:53.065 --> 28:55.367
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
MEL?

28:55.401 --> 28:58.004
YOU'RE A CUNT.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.179
- [clears throat]

29:07.213 --> 29:09.481
[door opens and slams]

29:11.884 --> 29:13.252
- HEY, HEY, HEY.

29:13.285 --> 29:15.054
- MM.
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

29:15.087 --> 29:16.388
- OH, I'M SO HOT.

29:16.422 --> 29:17.990
I COULD JUST GO DOWN
ON YOU RIGHT HERE.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.391
- HEY, DON'T--

29:19.425 --> 29:20.793
I DON'T THINK MRS. GIANNINI
WOULD APPRECIATE

29:20.827 --> 29:22.528
TAKING TIBERIUS
FOR HIS STROLL

29:22.561 --> 29:24.396
AND SEEING YOU
GIVING ME A BLOW JOB.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.532
- MM.
- OKAY.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.267
- THEN HURRY UP
AND OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.002
- BE PATIENT.

29:30.036 --> 29:31.938
WE GOT THE PLACE TO OURSELVES
ALL AFTERNOON, OKAY?

29:31.971 --> 29:33.272
SO YOU CAN SCREAM
AS LOUD AS YOU...

29:33.305 --> 29:34.306
- SHIT!

29:34.340 --> 29:36.275
- WHAT THE FUCK?

29:36.308 --> 29:37.576
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE WORKING.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.011
- WE DIDN'T KNOW YOU'D BE.

29:39.045 --> 29:41.580
- GET OUT OF HERE,
YOU SICK FUCK.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.183
- I WANT MY MONEY BACK.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.584
- HERE, YOU CAN PUT IT
TOWARDS YOUR BAIL

29:45.617 --> 29:47.019
WHEN I CALL THE POLICE
AND HAVE YOU ARRESTED

29:47.053 --> 29:49.088
FOR SOLICITING A MINOR.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.556
[door slams]

29:50.589 --> 29:53.159
- ONE MORE HAPPY, SATISFIED
CUSTOMER, THANKS TO YOU.

29:53.192 --> 29:54.560
- WE DID NOT GIVE YOU
A KEY

29:54.593 --> 29:56.295
SO THAT YOU COULD TURN TRICKS
IN OUR HOME.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.097
- YOU NEVER SAID
I COULDN'T.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.099
- BECAUSE WE NEVER THOUGHT
YOU WOULD.

30:00.132 --> 30:03.335
- WELL, I NEED THE MONEY, OKAY?
- FOR WHAT?

30:03.369 --> 30:04.971
- FOR WHEN YOU GET TIRED
OF DOING YOUR GOOD DEED

30:05.004 --> 30:06.338
AND YOU KICK ME OUT.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.207
- WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT KICKING YOU OUT?

30:08.240 --> 30:10.309
- YOU PULL ANOTHER STUNT
LIKE THIS, AND WE WILL.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.511
- LOOK, IF THIS IS SOME TEST

30:12.544 --> 30:14.613
TO SEE HOW FAR
YOU CAN GO TO PROVOKE US

30:14.646 --> 30:16.615
SO THAT WE'LL TELL YOU TO LEAVE,
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.317
WE WANT YOU HERE.

30:18.350 --> 30:21.087
- SO YOU CAN FEEL GOOD
ABOUT YOURSELF.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.488
WELL, FUCK THAT SHIT!

30:22.521 --> 30:25.491
YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DAMN KEY.

30:32.398 --> 30:34.400
- HEY, MAN, WHAT'S UP?
YOU WANT SOME OF THIS?

30:34.433 --> 30:36.202
- HEY, COME ON, SLOW DOWN.

30:36.235 --> 30:38.104
- BUDDY, BUDDY!
YEAH, YOU!

30:38.137 --> 30:40.639
- [grunts]

30:40.672 --> 30:43.009
- HEY, I GOT A NICE, TIGHT ASS
HERE FOR YA.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.111
- HEY!
YOU LIKE YOUNG DICK?

30:45.144 --> 30:48.080
IT'S YOURS.
50 BUCKS!

30:48.114 --> 30:51.217
WOULDN'T HAVE DONE YOU ANYWAY,
MOTHERFUCKER!

30:51.250 --> 30:52.618
- HEY, HOW ABOUT A THREESOME,
BABY?

30:52.651 --> 30:55.354
- WHOA.
- CHECK IT OUT.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.623
- THERE'S MY DADDY.
- WHOO-HOO.

30:57.656 --> 30:59.225
- HEY, OVER HERE, BUD.

30:59.258 --> 31:01.360
- FIGURED YOU'D
COME AROUND EVENTUALLY.

31:01.393 --> 31:02.494
- GET IN.

31:02.528 --> 31:05.231
- THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK.

AND I WANTED THEM.

42:09.961 --> 42:11.296
I COULD FUCK
A ROOMFUL OF GUYS

42:11.329 --> 42:16.167

42:19.337 --> 42:20.572
'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT ME.

MAKE SENSE.

42:53.104 --> 42:55.206
- I DON'T--

42:55.240 --> 42:58.276

AH, I GUESS AT THEIR AGE,
IF THEY WANT IT,

44:02.874 --> 44:03.809
