WEBVTT

00:04.399 --> 00:05.999
Ah, resort season...

00:06.068 --> 00:07.734
when the umbrellas go up,

00:07.803 --> 00:09.568
the fresh towels go down,

00:09.638 --> 00:11.805
and the sparkling pool awaits.

00:13.542 --> 00:14.808
Sorry, buddy.

00:14.877 --> 00:16.143
See you next summer.

00:21.216 --> 00:23.650
Sue was gonna do a little cleaning
up of her own,

00:23.752 --> 00:25.118
and at the top of her list...

00:25.187 --> 00:26.653
get rid of her brother.

00:26.755 --> 00:28.288
Axl, that's my robe.

00:28.390 --> 00:29.923
Fine.

00:30.025 --> 00:31.525
Ew! No, don't take it off!

00:31.627 --> 00:32.859
Ugh! What are you doing here?

00:32.961 --> 00:34.628
I'm waiting for Lexie to get
back from psychology class,

00:34.730 --> 00:35.962
and then we might go out or something.

00:36.031 --> 00:38.031
Oh, that reminds me...
got to pick up a new lady razor,

00:38.133 --> 00:39.432
'cause, you know, between my beard

00:39.535 --> 00:42.169
and your wire-brush leg hairs,
it is trashed.

00:42.271 --> 00:44.638
Look, I believe I was very cool

00:44.740 --> 00:46.273
about you dating my best friend,

00:46.375 --> 00:49.109
but I didn't know it'd mean
that you'd be here all the time

00:49.211 --> 00:50.944
even when she is not here.

00:51.046 --> 00:52.712
Um, our dad is not paying the rent.

00:52.814 --> 00:53.813
Lexie's dad is.

00:53.916 --> 00:55.815
So whatever Lexie wants, Lexie gets.

00:55.918 --> 00:57.617
And Lexie wants all this,

00:57.686 --> 01:00.020
and Lexie's dad wants me
to have your chips.

01:00.122 --> 01:02.155
I can't take it anymore!
I am sick of you!

01:02.224 --> 01:03.323
Oh, my God.

01:03.425 --> 01:05.058
Sue, back in the old days,
they used to live

01:05.160 --> 01:06.760
with their siblings
and their grandparents

01:06.862 --> 01:08.328
and multiple generations.

01:08.430 --> 01:09.396
You should embrace this.

01:09.464 --> 01:10.931
And truth is, as the eldest son,

01:11.033 --> 01:12.098
I could have married you off

01:12.201 --> 01:13.600
to some old geezer
for a couple of goats,

01:13.702 --> 01:14.868
and this place would be mine.

01:14.970 --> 01:16.670
You should be thanking me
for letting you stay.

01:16.738 --> 01:17.671
What's your point?

01:17.773 --> 01:19.005
Give me your Netflix password.

01:19.107 --> 01:20.073
Ohh! That's it!

01:20.175 --> 01:21.208
No more!

01:21.310 --> 01:23.210
I'm out of here.

01:24.246 --> 01:26.379
And put that drink on a coaster!

01:31.019 --> 01:32.319
What the... Axl?

01:32.421 --> 01:34.321
Seriously, I need your Netflix password.

01:34.423 --> 01:35.722
How did you get here so fast?

01:35.791 --> 01:36.990
I don't drive like a grandma.

01:37.092 --> 01:38.158
That's not my fault.

01:38.260 --> 01:40.060
Aunt Edie's car
doesn't turn left anymore.

01:40.162 --> 01:42.062
Since you're both here,
I believe you've noticed

01:42.130 --> 01:43.830
we now own a microfiche machine.

01:43.899 --> 01:46.933
Now, there is a sign-in
clipboard to reserve times.

01:47.035 --> 01:48.902
I just ask that everyone
respects the schedule

01:49.004 --> 01:50.770
in order that we all get
a chance to enjoy it.

01:50.872 --> 01:53.039
And please, no food or drink
near the machine.

01:53.141 --> 01:55.609
The only reason we're both here
is because Axl decided

01:55.711 --> 01:57.877
to follow me home to torture me.

01:57.980 --> 01:59.546
Uh, actually, not about you.

01:59.648 --> 02:00.914
Got a speed-interviewing event

02:00.983 --> 02:03.183
at the Orson Cozy Suites
and Conference Center.

02:03.285 --> 02:06.119
I've heard of speed reading,
but not speed interviewing.

02:06.221 --> 02:08.555
It's where I'll chat with a bunch
of employers for, like, two minutes each,

02:08.624 --> 02:10.289
and then they'll all fight over
who gets to hire me.

02:11.927 --> 02:15.128
Hey! Everybody picked the
perfect weekend to come home.

02:15.230 --> 02:16.496
Pool's ready.

02:16.598 --> 02:18.798
It's warm, pH level's good,

02:18.900 --> 02:21.001
it's a shimmering blue,
got all the animals out.

02:21.103 --> 02:22.202
You're all good to go.

02:22.304 --> 02:23.737
- Okay. Thanks.
- Yeah, thanks.         - Cool.

02:23.839 --> 02:26.072
Yep. Anytime you want to get in.

02:26.174 --> 02:27.440
- Can't wait.
- Mm-hmm.   - Okay.

02:28.410 --> 02:29.876
All right.

02:31.446 --> 02:33.380
Pbbbbbht.

02:37.552 --> 02:38.718
Pool's open.

02:38.787 --> 02:40.420
All right.

02:43.492 --> 02:44.858
Pool's open.

02:46.128 --> 02:47.894
Ooh! You clean up nice!

02:47.963 --> 02:49.229
Are you nervous?
'Cause you shouldn't be nervous.

02:49.331 --> 02:50.397
Nah, I got this.

02:50.465 --> 02:52.866
I have two interesting facts
about myself,

02:52.934 --> 02:54.701
a pertinent question for each company,

02:54.770 --> 02:55.802
and, if there's time,

02:55.871 --> 02:57.971
a pithy comment on the world at large.

02:58.073 --> 03:00.006
"Crazy times, huh?"

03:00.942 --> 03:02.075
Uh-huh.

03:02.144 --> 03:03.443
Do you need to practice?

03:03.512 --> 03:05.312
Okay, I'm gonna pretend
to be an employer.

03:05.380 --> 03:08.581
Hi. I'm... Mom from Mom Co.

03:08.684 --> 03:10.517
Nice to meet you.
Tell me a little about yourself.

03:10.585 --> 03:12.385
I'm not really interested
in working for Mom Co.

03:12.454 --> 03:13.820
Been with the company over 20 years.

03:13.922 --> 03:14.954
It's time to move on.

03:15.023 --> 03:16.323
See, that's not a good attitude,

03:16.425 --> 03:17.857
and employers pick up on that.

03:17.926 --> 03:19.693
I'm just saying you have a tendency

03:19.761 --> 03:22.595
to close up your body
and cross your arms.

03:22.664 --> 03:25.065
Listen, I read an article
about a pit boss in Las Vegas

03:25.133 --> 03:26.833
who said you can learn
everything about a person

03:26.935 --> 03:28.468
just by reading their body language,

03:28.537 --> 03:31.338
and right now you are exhibiting
off-putting body language.

03:31.373 --> 03:33.440
Well, that's what I'm going for,
because I am put off.

03:33.542 --> 03:35.809
What you want to do is
just put your shoulders back

03:35.911 --> 03:36.776
and keep your head up.

03:36.878 --> 03:38.044
That signals confidence.

03:38.146 --> 03:39.646
- Mom.
- And keep the hair out of your eyes.

03:39.748 --> 03:40.947
Just soften your face.

03:41.049 --> 03:42.048
Mom!

03:42.117 --> 03:44.150
Okay, okay. You're gonna
do great. Go get 'em.

03:45.053 --> 03:46.553
- Wait!
- Mom!

03:46.655 --> 03:49.622
Your jacket... Why is it
only faded in this one spot?

03:49.725 --> 03:51.825
What? What? What?

03:51.893 --> 03:53.393
Oh, shoot!

03:53.462 --> 03:55.028
God, the curtains broke
in the Winnebago,

03:55.097 --> 03:57.263
so I stapled the jacket up
to block out the sun.

03:57.366 --> 03:58.598
So you used your suit?

03:58.700 --> 03:59.999
Relax. It's fine.

04:00.102 --> 04:01.768
I'll just... I won't turn around.

04:01.837 --> 04:03.370
No... T-This is too important.

04:03.472 --> 04:05.138
You've got to look sharp.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.339
I have an idea.

04:08.176 --> 04:10.110
Maybe if we roll up the sleeves.

04:10.178 --> 04:12.712
Oh, my God. I am not wearing
my daddy's jacket!

04:12.781 --> 04:14.647
I'll end up working at Mom Co. forever.

04:14.716 --> 04:16.516
Well, Brick's suit jacket
is your old jacket.

04:16.584 --> 04:18.385
Maybe you can still fit into that.

04:18.487 --> 04:19.652
What... Really, Mom?!

04:19.755 --> 04:21.721
I can't even raise my arms
to shake someone's hand.

04:21.822 --> 04:24.457
Oh, wait... I think I have
an old jacket that might work.

04:24.905 --> 04:26.526
It's very mannish.

04:27.496 --> 04:29.729
Not as mannish as I remembered.

04:29.765 --> 04:32.098
You know, I should
wear that again. It's cute.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.099
Pool's open.

04:33.168 --> 04:34.667
Pbbbht.

04:34.703 --> 04:38.037
So, with a little medical tape
and a couple of safety pins,

04:38.140 --> 04:39.839
Axl was ready to knock 'em dead.

04:39.941 --> 04:41.107
I'm Axl Heck.

04:45.781 --> 04:48.047
Yes, I have a résumé right here.

04:48.150 --> 04:49.549
No.

04:49.618 --> 04:51.584
- Are those funeral programs?
- Yeah.

04:51.653 --> 04:53.620
A lot of friends and family have died,
so I just want to work, work, work

04:53.722 --> 04:55.288
to avoid the pain.

04:55.357 --> 04:58.124
It's always been a dream of mine
to work at a global seed company.

04:58.226 --> 05:00.527
We don't sell seeds. We sell mattresses.

05:00.629 --> 05:01.661
Oh.

05:01.730 --> 05:02.829
Right, right, right,
right, right, right, right.

05:02.898 --> 05:05.698
But... you have to grow
the cotton with seeds

05:05.767 --> 05:07.801
to make the mattresses, and... Ow!

05:09.471 --> 05:10.970
Safety pin.

05:11.039 --> 05:12.439
Sorry... forgot something.

05:12.541 --> 05:14.641
My greatest flaw is
that I'm a perfectionist.

05:15.677 --> 05:17.477
Yes, your overall growth is flat,

05:17.579 --> 05:19.245
but I think you have to
look at the macro picture,

05:19.347 --> 05:21.181
which I find very promising.

05:21.283 --> 05:23.049
I'm sorry our time went so fast.

05:23.151 --> 05:24.584
Here, let me give you my card.

05:24.686 --> 05:25.652
Oh.

05:33.902 --> 05:35.001
Get off your phone.

05:35.070 --> 05:36.803
And I never thought
I'd have to say this...

05:36.872 --> 05:38.105
Get off the microfiche.

05:38.173 --> 05:40.207
Look, it's beautiful out there,

05:40.275 --> 05:42.609
and you guys spent the whole day
looking at screens.

05:42.678 --> 05:43.810
I busted my butt on that pool.

05:43.879 --> 05:45.245
I even got the good kind of chlorine...

05:45.314 --> 05:47.600
that doesn't cause rashes...
and nobody went in.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.100
That's it. I'm getting rid of the pool.

05:49.202 --> 05:50.368
- No!
- What?!

05:50.436 --> 05:52.303
It costs money, with all the water
and the chemicals,

05:52.405 --> 05:54.105
and frankly, I'm tired
of mowing around it.

05:54.173 --> 05:55.506
But we love the pool.

05:55.541 --> 05:57.475
Yeah, I would get in right now,
but it's about to be dark,

05:57.543 --> 05:59.010
and that teen
who shoplifted from Quiksilver

05:59.078 --> 06:00.411
is still on the loose.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.713
Look, all I know is, last time
anybody's been in that pool

06:02.782 --> 06:04.015
was two summers ago.

06:04.050 --> 06:06.217
- We'll go in tomorrow. We promise.
- Mm-hmm.

06:10.590 --> 06:12.623
Hey! That's my good funeral jacket.

06:12.658 --> 06:14.191
What's going on? How did it go?

06:14.260 --> 06:15.292
It sucked!

06:15.361 --> 06:16.727
That stupid jacket ruined my confidence,

06:16.796 --> 06:17.962
and that's the one thing I have...

06:18.031 --> 06:19.997
totally unearned confidence.

06:20.066 --> 06:21.499
And no wonder it's your funeral jacket.

06:21.567 --> 06:23.234
I died in it, like, 30 times.

06:23.336 --> 06:24.869
Oh, I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

06:24.904 --> 06:27.104
Blood was dripping down my hand!

06:27.173 --> 06:28.672
Oh, yeah, that's bad.

06:28.741 --> 06:30.174
Sounds like you could use a swim.

06:30.243 --> 06:31.675
A swim?! My God!

06:31.744 --> 06:33.511
I'm about to graduate, and I got no job!

06:33.546 --> 06:36.881
This is not supposed to happen
to me. I'm Axl Heck.

06:36.949 --> 06:38.215
I'm a winner.

06:38.284 --> 06:39.683
Or, at least, I was.

06:42.488 --> 06:44.688
Hey, Woolworth's is looking
for a Christian soda jerk.

06:44.757 --> 06:45.890
You think he'd like that?

06:48.995 --> 06:50.394
Hey, hey, hey! It's a beautiful day!

06:50.496 --> 06:51.495
Why aren't you in the pool?

06:51.564 --> 06:52.763
I don't want to go in the pool.

06:52.799 --> 06:53.831
Why aren't you in the pool?

06:53.866 --> 06:55.666
'Cause I don't want to go in the pool.

06:55.735 --> 06:56.801
I'm 20, okay?

06:56.869 --> 06:58.469
You're young. You should be frolicking.

06:58.504 --> 07:01.138
I frolicked once when I was 8.
Didn't care for it.

07:02.175 --> 07:03.741
Oh, crap! Too late. He's home.

07:06.646 --> 07:07.945
Hey! What are you doing?!

07:08.047 --> 07:09.380
We have to look like
we've been in the pool!

07:09.482 --> 07:11.115
- Now do me!
- Oh, my God!

07:11.217 --> 07:13.050
Aah!

07:13.152 --> 07:15.319
- Whoa!
- Okay, okay!

07:17.356 --> 07:18.322
Hey, Dad!

07:18.424 --> 07:19.557
Hey.

07:19.659 --> 07:21.292
Yeah, yeah. We were just in the pool.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.526
It was fun.

07:22.628 --> 07:23.894
Really?

07:23.963 --> 07:25.296
Where are your bathing suits?

07:25.331 --> 07:27.531
We dried them in the dryer.

07:27.567 --> 07:29.900
And then we put them away
in the... d-drawer.

07:30.903 --> 07:31.869
How long were you in there?

07:31.971 --> 07:32.970
- Hours.    - Hours.

07:33.039 --> 07:34.872
Hours. Yep.

07:34.941 --> 07:37.908
Oh, we were all pruned up,
we were in there for so long.

07:37.977 --> 07:39.643
Remember how much fun we had, Brick?

07:39.712 --> 07:41.745
- I said "Marco," he said "Polo,"
- Mm-hmm.

07:41.814 --> 07:44.648
And so on and so forth
and what have you.

07:44.717 --> 07:45.983
Did you find the quarters at the bottom

07:46.018 --> 07:47.284
that I threw in there
for you to dive down and get?

07:47.386 --> 07:48.752
- Absolutely.    - We did.

07:48.821 --> 07:50.788
That's funny, 'cause I didn't
put any quarters at the bottom.

07:51.791 --> 07:54.592
You're busted. Use it or lose it.

08:00.266 --> 08:01.532
Knock, knock.

08:01.601 --> 08:04.835
I brought you my nightstand cookies.

08:04.937 --> 08:08.172
Oh, I'm sorry about
the whole jacket fiasco,

08:08.274 --> 08:10.508
but, hey, it's all
just fodder for your TED Talk.

08:10.576 --> 08:11.842
The only TED Talk I'll be giving

08:11.911 --> 08:15.312
will be to another guy
in the gutter named Ted.

08:15.414 --> 08:16.480
Well...

08:16.549 --> 08:18.649
I might have something
to make you feel better.

08:18.751 --> 08:20.951
Look, I know you're
heading out into the world,

08:21.020 --> 08:24.421
and you need to look professional, so...

08:24.490 --> 08:25.756
I'm gonna buy you a suit.

08:25.825 --> 08:28.058
Hmm. We gonna hit a garage sale?

08:28.127 --> 08:30.728
Nope. We're going to a real suit store.

08:30.796 --> 08:32.830
I am taking you to The Suit Plantation.

08:32.965 --> 08:33.797
Mm-hmm.

08:33.900 --> 08:35.499
It's in a mini-mall on Route 37

08:35.601 --> 08:37.568
next door to the gas station
with the good hot dogs.

08:37.669 --> 08:39.169
Wait, wait, wait.
Does that include pants?

08:39.272 --> 08:40.804
Yes, but you have to keep them on.

08:40.907 --> 08:43.207
And we might have to take one selfie.

08:43.595 --> 08:44.775
All right.

08:44.877 --> 08:46.710
Just no arms around each other.

08:46.779 --> 08:48.712
Let's just see how we feel
when we get there.

08:52.418 --> 08:53.350
He... H-H-Hey!

08:53.452 --> 08:54.585
Where do you think you're going?

08:54.687 --> 08:56.020
I'm going to read.

08:56.088 --> 08:57.755
Mm, no. I think
you're getting in the pool.

08:57.823 --> 08:59.490
It's all good...
I checked the pool for quarters,

08:59.559 --> 09:00.524
and I wet down the towels.

09:00.626 --> 09:01.942
- We're covered for today.
- Mnh-mnh!

09:02.011 --> 09:04.562
Brick, Dad said, "Use it or lose it,"

09:04.664 --> 09:07.598
so you better get out there
and use that pool.

09:07.700 --> 09:08.966
You know, maybe we should lose it,

09:09.035 --> 09:10.801
since neither of us
seem to want to use it.

09:10.903 --> 09:13.270
Don't say that!
We have had that pool forever.

09:13.372 --> 09:15.139
It's like the fifth family member.

09:15.208 --> 09:16.574
I'm the fifth family member.

09:16.642 --> 09:18.008
Don't you get it, Brick?

09:18.077 --> 09:19.843
This is about more than the pool.

09:19.946 --> 09:23.347
They are trying to turn this
into an adult house.

09:24.517 --> 09:25.816
What do you mean?

09:25.918 --> 09:28.219
I mean, we're getting older,

09:28.287 --> 09:30.554
and Mom and Dad are
smelling the barn on parenting

09:30.656 --> 09:32.189
and looking to phase us out.

09:32.291 --> 09:34.525
Our yearbooks, inspirational posters,

09:34.627 --> 09:36.660
"Planet Nowhere" books...

09:36.729 --> 09:38.062
you think they're gonna keep all that?

09:38.164 --> 09:39.163
No.

09:39.198 --> 09:40.464
They wouldn't do that.

09:40.533 --> 09:41.432
Wouldn't they?

09:41.534 --> 09:42.499
The other day,

09:42.568 --> 09:44.702
I heard Mom complain
about the chipped bowls.

09:44.770 --> 09:46.337
She wanted to get all new ones,

09:46.405 --> 09:48.305
and then Dad said, and I quote,

09:48.374 --> 09:50.541
"Wait till the kids are gone."

09:50.643 --> 09:52.009
I love our chipped bowls.

09:52.111 --> 09:53.544
Well, you can kiss 'em goodbye.

09:53.646 --> 09:55.179
Don't actually kiss them.
You'll cut your lips.

09:55.281 --> 09:56.647
But this is how it starts...

09:56.682 --> 09:59.316
You leave to go to college,
and you come back, and poof...

09:59.418 --> 10:00.985
all the jigsaw puzzles are gone.

10:01.087 --> 10:02.286
But it isn't Christmas without saying

10:02.355 --> 10:03.554
that we're gonna do the jigsaw puzzle

10:03.656 --> 10:04.722
and then not doing it.

10:04.824 --> 10:05.656
It happens, Brick.

10:05.758 --> 10:07.524
Remember Grandma's doll room?

10:07.627 --> 10:09.493
That used to be Aunt Janet's room.

10:09.595 --> 10:10.961
That's right.

10:11.030 --> 10:13.564
Before you know it,
your room becomes Dad's TV room,

10:13.666 --> 10:15.232
and my room becomes Mom's TV room,

10:15.268 --> 10:16.767
and then we're all married with kids,

10:16.869 --> 10:19.169
but do we have rooms
to cram our families into?

10:19.272 --> 10:20.204
No!

10:20.306 --> 10:21.939
We have to stay at the Ramada Inn

10:22.041 --> 10:23.474
because our rooms are filled

10:23.576 --> 10:25.409
with recliner chairs and hand weights.

10:25.511 --> 10:27.711
This isn't about nostalgia
anymore, Brick.

10:27.813 --> 10:29.913
This is about our very survival.

10:30.016 --> 10:32.149
They can't wait to get rid of us.

10:32.767 --> 10:34.551
Well, they've never been big fans.

10:34.654 --> 10:37.321
Look, Sue, you're overreacting.

10:37.390 --> 10:38.722
Maybe you need to cool off.

10:38.824 --> 10:40.891
Perhaps a dip in the pool
would do the trick.

10:48.067 --> 10:49.166
What are you doing?

10:49.268 --> 10:50.434
Nothing.

10:54.709 --> 10:55.774
Well, we're just so proud.

10:55.843 --> 10:58.433
He's graduating from
East Indiana State in May.

10:58.535 --> 11:00.954
Terrible football team. They stink.

11:01.581 --> 11:03.447
Well, they didn't play the right people.

11:03.516 --> 11:05.015
Anyway, he's going into the world

11:05.084 --> 11:06.650
with a B.S. in business.

11:06.719 --> 11:07.985
Pretty great, huh?

11:08.054 --> 11:09.520
It's so hard to get a job nowadays.

11:09.589 --> 11:11.055
I'm glad I'm almost dead.

11:13.493 --> 11:14.658
Oh!

11:14.760 --> 11:17.228
You look so handsome!

11:18.364 --> 11:19.630
Ohh!

11:19.732 --> 11:22.132
How does it feel? Good? Do you like it?

11:22.201 --> 11:24.568
Yeah, it feels good. I like it.

11:24.637 --> 11:26.403
Okay, but do you love it?

11:26.472 --> 11:28.138
Hmm? Got to love it.

11:29.575 --> 11:30.441
Uh, Mom.

11:30.543 --> 11:31.709
Sorry. Sorry.

11:31.811 --> 11:33.277
Got carried away.

11:33.379 --> 11:35.045
It's just that you look so grown up,

11:35.114 --> 11:36.714
and you never let me touch you anymore.

11:36.816 --> 11:38.616
Okay.

11:38.651 --> 11:40.484
Um... I like the suit,
but I was thinking

11:40.586 --> 11:42.486
something darker
might bring out my eyes.

11:42.555 --> 11:44.221
He'd like to see it in something darker!

11:49.328 --> 11:52.630
I couldn't believe my little
boy was graduating college.

11:52.698 --> 11:54.131
Wow.

11:54.200 --> 11:57.234
Seems like only yesterday
I dreaded taking him shopping.

11:57.303 --> 11:59.103
Axl, honey, you have to wear pants!

11:59.171 --> 12:00.704
You can't go without pants
forever, you know!

12:00.806 --> 12:03.073
That's it! I'm not buying you
something I've never seen on you.

12:03.175 --> 12:04.341
I'm coming in.

12:04.410 --> 12:05.576
Oops! Sorry, sir!

12:05.645 --> 12:07.278
I didn't see anything.

12:07.346 --> 12:09.914
Axl! Come out of there this minute!

12:10.016 --> 12:11.916
Ooh! This is cute!

12:13.185 --> 12:15.519
So, while I was trying
to keep it together,

12:15.621 --> 12:18.355
Brick was doing whatever
it took to keep his pool.

12:19.458 --> 12:21.976
- Brick, can I get out now?
- Nope.

12:22.045 --> 12:25.396
My dad hasn't come home
to see us enjoying the pool yet.

12:25.464 --> 12:27.264
Well. What's this?

12:27.333 --> 12:29.066
Got a little pool party going on here?

12:29.135 --> 12:30.601
Ah, Dad. Great.

12:30.670 --> 12:32.870
As you can see,
we are indeed enjoying the pool.

12:34.340 --> 12:35.606
Frolic.

12:37.076 --> 12:38.309
Yay.

12:39.612 --> 12:42.012
Yep, we're all having a great time.

12:42.081 --> 12:43.447
Please don't say how I'm feeling.

12:43.549 --> 12:44.782
You know how I hate that.

12:45.651 --> 12:46.951
You know, the way I see it,

12:47.053 --> 12:48.485
there's still something
missing from that pool...

12:48.588 --> 12:49.453
you.

12:49.555 --> 12:51.422
I... would love to be in there,

12:51.490 --> 12:53.023
but I feel a poop coming on.

12:54.139 --> 12:55.239
Playing it safe.

12:58.698 --> 12:59.663
Stop!

12:59.765 --> 13:00.831
No, you stop.

13:03.402 --> 13:04.468
I don't get it.

13:04.503 --> 13:05.769
Why do you care so much about something

13:05.838 --> 13:07.404
that you ignore most of the time?

13:07.473 --> 13:09.273
Well, by that theory,

13:09.375 --> 13:11.208
what are you still doing with Mom?

13:14.847 --> 13:16.380
I love this suit on you.

13:16.482 --> 13:18.949
And it loves being on me.

13:19.051 --> 13:20.117
You needed a good suit.

13:20.186 --> 13:21.619
Now you have something
to wear to interviews...

13:21.721 --> 13:22.886
maybe even on a date.

13:22.955 --> 13:25.022
I know people don't wear suits
on dates anymore,

13:25.091 --> 13:26.824
but maybe if you go to a play
or something.

13:26.892 --> 13:28.125
People still go to plays.

13:28.194 --> 13:30.294
I mean, I don't.
Your dad's glued to the couch.

13:30.396 --> 13:31.996
But when girls see you in this suit,

13:32.031 --> 13:33.697
they are gonna be all over you.

13:35.635 --> 13:38.469
Well, I don't really
know about that, but...

13:38.537 --> 13:39.670
now that you brought it up,

13:39.739 --> 13:42.473
I have actually...
kind of been... seeing someone.

13:43.776 --> 13:44.675
Lexie.

13:44.744 --> 13:46.543
Oh! Oh.

13:46.612 --> 13:47.745
Okay. Really?

13:47.847 --> 13:48.846
Oh. Lexie.

13:48.914 --> 13:51.649
Well, she's nice. That's great.

13:51.717 --> 13:53.884
Wow. Okay.

13:53.919 --> 13:56.186
I don't know... I kind of
thought you'd be all like, um,

13:56.255 --> 13:58.689
"You just broke up with April.
It's too soon.

13:58.791 --> 13:59.657
Use your brain."

13:59.759 --> 14:01.325
What? No. Pfft.

14:01.427 --> 14:02.893
That doesn't sound like me.

14:02.995 --> 14:04.461
Well, anyway, you know, it's...

14:04.530 --> 14:06.030
a little too early in the whole thing,

14:06.098 --> 14:07.297
but we definitely like each other,

14:07.366 --> 14:09.833
so... gonna take this one slow.

14:10.703 --> 14:11.869
Well, that's totes cool.

14:11.971 --> 14:13.871
Thanks for filling me in on the haps.

14:15.741 --> 14:19.410
Wow! Suit shopping and my son
confiding on me on his own!

14:19.478 --> 14:21.578
If I could get him to go for
one of those good hot dogs

14:21.647 --> 14:25.182
from the gas station next door,
this would be the perfect day.

14:25.284 --> 14:26.650
Oh, before you take the suit off,

14:26.719 --> 14:28.252
maybe you should check the pocket...

14:28.320 --> 14:29.520
make sure your wallet fits.

14:29.588 --> 14:30.988
Oh, I don't carry a wallet.

14:31.057 --> 14:32.623
Don't say it. Don't say it.

14:32.725 --> 14:33.891
Don't ruin the moment.

14:33.993 --> 14:35.526
He's a grown-up.
He can do what he wants.

14:35.594 --> 14:37.428
Really, Axl? Are you kidding me?

14:37.496 --> 14:39.997
You don't carry a wallet?
That is so dumb!

14:40.066 --> 14:41.265
Where are you putting your money?

14:41.367 --> 14:42.266
I said it.

14:42.368 --> 14:43.667
I put it in my sock.

14:43.769 --> 14:45.536
If I'm not wearing socks,
I put it in my shoe,

14:45.638 --> 14:47.271
and if I'm wearing flip-flops,
roll it up,

14:47.373 --> 14:48.439
tuck it behind my ear,

14:48.474 --> 14:50.074
where my illustrious hair
holds it in place.

14:50.142 --> 14:51.375
Are you kidding me?!

14:51.444 --> 14:53.343
Okay, you might be
taking job interviews,

14:53.412 --> 14:56.680
but you are acting like
some surfing ho daddy in Hawaii.

14:56.716 --> 14:58.949
You're an adult. You got to be
better with your money.

14:59.051 --> 15:00.584
Oh, my God. Here we go!

15:00.686 --> 15:01.752
I'm good with money.

15:01.854 --> 15:02.820
That's hilarious.

15:02.888 --> 15:04.121
You're gonna be getting a paycheck.

15:04.190 --> 15:06.657
You need a new bank account
with checks and registers...

15:06.759 --> 15:07.791
All right, all right, I got it.

15:07.893 --> 15:09.560
No! You don't got it!

15:09.662 --> 15:11.662
You have to keep up with how much
money you have in your account,

15:11.731 --> 15:12.963
you need cash when you leave the house.

15:13.032 --> 15:14.098
These are the things

15:14.200 --> 15:17.134
that separate a true adult
from a man-child.

15:17.203 --> 15:20.070
Wow. And I let you touch me
and everything.

15:22.208 --> 15:23.240
Kids.

15:23.342 --> 15:26.076
No one tells you how
they're gonna wreck your life.

15:26.178 --> 15:27.277
Cash or credit?

15:27.379 --> 15:28.579
Ugh. Credit.

15:31.117 --> 15:32.282
Wow.

15:32.307 --> 15:34.885
That's the fastest decline I ever got.

15:34.954 --> 15:36.787
What? It's declined?

15:36.889 --> 15:37.955
That can't be right.

15:37.990 --> 15:39.022
Can you try again?

15:39.125 --> 15:40.891
We have better luck with second swipes.

15:42.762 --> 15:43.460
Nope.

15:44.964 --> 15:48.198
Okay, listen, I just came down
pretty hard on my son

15:48.300 --> 15:49.967
for being irresponsible with money,

15:50.035 --> 15:53.003
so this isn't an ideal time
for this to be happening.

15:53.072 --> 15:54.538
Maybe you and I can work something out,

15:54.640 --> 15:56.440
like you let me have the suit

15:56.509 --> 15:57.674
and I'll pay you next mth.

15:57.743 --> 15:58.876
Why would I agree to that?

15:58.978 --> 16:01.145
You're obviously bad with money.

16:01.213 --> 16:02.379
Fine.

16:02.448 --> 16:03.580
Maybe I have enough cash.

16:04.650 --> 16:09.286
Let's see... We got twenty... three...

16:09.388 --> 16:10.921
Ooh! Look!

16:10.956 --> 16:12.289
I got a free water bottle from the gym.

16:12.391 --> 16:14.825
That's worth, what, like 10 bucks?

16:14.894 --> 16:16.093
- Ma'am.
- Ooh! Hah!

16:16.195 --> 16:19.096
A 20% off at the Orson Escape Room.

16:19.198 --> 16:21.298
We did that as a family. So fun.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.499
Ma'am.

16:22.568 --> 16:24.568
How about change?
You take change, right?

16:24.670 --> 16:26.537
I've got tons of change.

16:28.073 --> 16:29.239
A marble.

16:29.341 --> 16:32.109
I've heard of vintage marbles
going for $5,000,

16:32.178 --> 16:33.577
so... I think we're there.

16:35.181 --> 16:36.413
You take debit cards?

16:37.449 --> 16:38.582
Yeah.

16:38.651 --> 16:40.217
Wait, wait. No, you can't do that.

16:40.319 --> 16:41.485
You don't have any money.

16:41.587 --> 16:42.920
Actually, I do.

16:42.988 --> 16:44.822
You know, they gave us
football meal stipends,

16:44.890 --> 16:47.257
and I didn't always eat...
just kind of socked it away.

16:47.359 --> 16:49.393
Plus, I made a lot of money
selling grilled cheese,

16:49.495 --> 16:51.395
so, I don't know,
I've just been saving up.

16:51.497 --> 16:53.197
Feels like a good idea
to have a safety net.

16:53.299 --> 16:54.698
Ohh!

16:54.800 --> 16:56.400
I am gonna pay you back every cent.

16:56.502 --> 16:57.835
And I'm gonna pay for the hot dogs

16:57.937 --> 16:59.136
that we're gonna get next door.

17:00.272 --> 17:01.772
I just don't want this day to end.

17:01.874 --> 17:03.173
Oh, good.

17:05.070 --> 17:06.832
Ta-da!

17:06.925 --> 17:08.992
Wow! Look at you!

17:10.630 --> 17:12.097
Hey, look at this...

17:12.165 --> 17:14.031
even got room for this guy.

17:14.133 --> 17:15.366
Nice.

17:15.434 --> 17:17.867
Well, get ready to be
exhausted and miserable,

17:17.936 --> 17:20.037
'cause you are so getting a job now.

17:20.106 --> 17:21.362
Yeah!

17:23.242 --> 17:26.710
Um... yeah. Here's the thing, Mom.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.212
Uh...

17:29.482 --> 17:32.349
This whole time, I was...
kind of blaming the suit,

17:32.418 --> 17:34.885
but I think the problem
might have been me.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.017
What?

17:36.086 --> 17:37.438
Yeah. I don't know.

17:37.463 --> 17:38.922
I think I just got
kind of overwhelmed in there

17:38.991 --> 17:40.624
and kind of froze.

17:40.726 --> 17:41.992
I mean, it's a lot.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.928
Graduation's coming up,
all my friends are getting jobs,

17:44.997 --> 17:46.964
and I'm just starting to think
it might not happen for me.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.666
And why should it? I know nothing.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.401
Four years, I've been studying business.

17:50.469 --> 17:52.536
I literally have no idea what it is.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.838
Axl, let me tell you something...

17:54.907 --> 17:56.473
Now, I know this is gonna go against

17:56.542 --> 17:59.443
everything you know about me, but...

17:59.721 --> 18:01.912
I am not a terrible dental assistant.

18:01.981 --> 18:03.447
I actually know what I'm doing now.

18:03.549 --> 18:06.317
But in the beginning,
I was so overwhelmed.

18:06.385 --> 18:08.218
I would try to pass the instruments,

18:08.287 --> 18:09.820
and all I would hear Dr. Goodwin say is,

18:09.922 --> 18:11.722
"No, not that one... that one!"

18:11.824 --> 18:13.290
And all I hear the patients say is,

18:13.392 --> 18:14.658
"Ow! That's my tongue!"

18:14.760 --> 18:16.960
Okay, but, like, so, I find
someone who's willing to hire me,

18:17.029 --> 18:18.729
then I show up on my first day, and...

18:18.831 --> 18:20.264
how will I know
what I'm supposed to do?!

18:20.366 --> 18:21.365
Oh, you won't.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.100
But eventually, you'll figure it out.

18:23.169 --> 18:24.401
And then you'll have kids,

18:24.470 --> 18:27.805
and you'll be out-of-your-mind
scared all over again.

18:27.873 --> 18:29.455
You know, it's funny,

18:29.524 --> 18:31.508
'cause when you're young,
you're never scared,

18:31.577 --> 18:35.346
but when you become an adult,
you're scared all the time.

18:35.381 --> 18:38.115
I think that's how you know
you're an adult...

18:38.184 --> 18:40.308
even more than carrying a wallet.

18:44.490 --> 18:45.422
Ohh!

18:46.892 --> 18:49.026
Mom. Mom! Not on the suit.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.060
Sorry.

18:53.999 --> 18:55.966
Dad! Dad! W-W-W-Wait!

18:56.068 --> 18:57.668
Dad! Stop! No, no, no, no! Wait!

18:57.737 --> 18:59.536
Look! I was just going in for a swim!

18:59.638 --> 19:00.571
Me too!

19:00.639 --> 19:02.005
Sorry, pallies.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.307
I gave you plenty of chances,

19:03.409 --> 19:04.708
I warned you over and over again,

19:04.810 --> 19:06.076
and now it's done... it's over.

19:06.178 --> 19:07.211
Wait! No, no, no, no, no!

19:07.313 --> 19:08.612
No, look! Look! We're using the pool!

19:08.647 --> 19:09.847
Brick, swim under my leg!

19:09.949 --> 19:11.648
Yeah! And let's wet our hair
and play Beauty Parlor!

19:11.717 --> 19:13.083
- Oh, yeah, yeah!
- Wow!

19:13.185 --> 19:15.052
That ship has sailed. Sorry.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.528
- Marco!
- Polo!

19:16.631 --> 19:17.621
Please don't erase our childhood!

19:17.690 --> 19:18.756
We love our chipped bowls!

19:18.858 --> 19:19.757
And I love my room!

19:19.859 --> 19:20.858
I don't want it to be a room

19:20.926 --> 19:22.526
that Mom thinks she can do projects in

19:22.595 --> 19:24.695
and then just end up drying sweaters!

19:24.797 --> 19:26.230
See? Wha... Whoa!

19:26.332 --> 19:27.531
We love this!

19:27.633 --> 19:28.832
- Yeah! Whoo!
- Whee!

19:28.934 --> 19:30.567
Look how much fun we're having!

19:33.806 --> 19:35.272
Are you guys serious about this?

19:35.374 --> 19:36.607
You gonna keep on using this pool?

19:36.709 --> 19:37.775
Uh-huh!

19:37.843 --> 19:39.543
'Cause I don't want a repeat
of the badminton net.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.778
That thing was up 10 years...

19:40.846 --> 19:42.413
never used, had to mow around it.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.480
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:43.582 --> 19:44.715
You're gonna have to drag me out of it.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.017
My new home address is this pool!

19:47.086 --> 19:49.052
Me too... although
I might not be in here

19:49.155 --> 19:51.088
during peak sun hours,
'cause Cindy likes me pale.

19:51.223 --> 19:53.323
Hey, Brick and lady and your guy's dad!

19:53.392 --> 19:55.592
There's water all over your front yard!

19:55.628 --> 19:57.461
It's going into the street!

19:57.563 --> 20:01.031
Whoa! Is that a pool?!

20:01.133 --> 20:02.933
Whoa! You lucky ducks!

20:03.002 --> 20:06.470
You're so lucky to have
your own pool in your own yard!

20:06.539 --> 20:08.806
I wish we had a pool.

20:08.874 --> 20:12.569
I'd give anything in the whole
world to have a pool!

20:17.316 --> 20:19.183
Go ask your mom if you can have a pool.

20:19.285 --> 20:20.517
Really?!

20:21.320 --> 20:22.517
Really.

20:27.259 --> 20:29.593
Axl wasn't the only one growing up.

20:29.695 --> 20:31.595
Sue and Brick were, too.

20:31.697 --> 20:33.764
It's hard to let go of your childhood,

20:33.866 --> 20:35.933
but there's a certain peace
that comes from knowing

20:36.035 --> 20:38.969
someone else is gonna love
your pool as much as you did.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.270
- Watch me, Mommy!
- Watch me!      - No, watch me!

20:40.372 --> 20:41.538
- No, watch me!  - Watch me!
- Marco!

20:41.607 --> 20:43.207
No, I'm Marco!

20:43.309 --> 20:45.476
I want a full-size Popsicle!

20:45.578 --> 20:47.010
No, I want a...

20:47.112 --> 20:49.913
I just wish they could love it
a little bit quieter.

20:50.015 --> 20:52.916
So... what exactly
were you measuring my room for?

20:53.018 --> 20:55.085
Hey, you know the rules...
no talking at dinner.
