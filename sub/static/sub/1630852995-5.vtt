07:53.740 --> 07:56.610
Grubby! Grubby! Grubby!

07:56.643 --> 08:00.447
- No, no. No Grubby, no.
Boo Grubby.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.216
Cancel me.

08:02.249 --> 08:05.686
- Bad Grubby,
stop throwing wine, please.

08:05.719 --> 08:10.157
Please, Mama.

08:10.190 --> 08:13.126
[together]
Oh, my God. What the? Grubby.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.028
- There were like nine
different versions

08:15.062 --> 08:16.530
of the Grubby costume
in her crafting room.

08:16.563 --> 08:18.365
It was like Tony Stark's
lab in there.

08:18.398 --> 08:20.400
- Shh. Be quiet.
I'm watching this.

08:20.434 --> 08:23.637
- They canceled Smoking Baby,
son.

08:23.670 --> 08:27.307
I'm just trying to protect our
family's legacy.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.142
- I know, Mama.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.011
Mr. Hunchman
figured out your plan:

08:31.044 --> 08:32.579
trashing the Tesla dealership,

08:32.613 --> 08:35.382
the Apple store,
then the hot yoga studio

08:35.415 --> 08:37.584
all leading to this fancy
white wine shop.

08:37.618 --> 08:41.688
- Exactly, all the fancy shit
that liberals like.

08:41.722 --> 08:45.492
I thought if I attacked them
then the Woke Mob

08:45.526 --> 08:50.130
would cancel Grubby
and we'd get Smoking Baby back.

08:50.164 --> 08:53.667
But Grubby just got more
and more popular.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.236
- 'Cause liberals don't love
those places, Mama.

08:56.270 --> 08:58.605
Deep down everyone hates
those places.

08:58.639 --> 08:59.706
- Really?

08:59.740 --> 09:02.142
Even this white wine shop?

09:02.176 --> 09:04.044
What is there to hate
about a store

09:04.077 --> 09:05.779
that only serves whites?

09:05.812 --> 09:07.414
[crowd gasps, boos]

09:07.447 --> 09:09.116
- Cancel that lady.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.084
- Hey, she's talking
about wine.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.053
My mama isn't racist.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.022
Uh, are you?
- No.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.223
It's just...
[sighs]

09:16.256 --> 09:18.992
Monica,
I don't get the cosplay.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.461
You dress my boy up,
hide him in fur

09:21.495 --> 09:23.330
instead of letting him be
the big,

09:23.363 --> 09:27.267
beautiful Smoking Baby
he was born to be.

09:27.301 --> 09:29.469
- Uh, Mitch,
you want to take this one?

09:29.503 --> 09:31.171
- I love her, Mama.

09:31.205 --> 09:33.640
And I don't want to shave my
whole body and wear a diaper

09:33.674 --> 09:35.142
or smoke, actually.

09:35.175 --> 09:39.012
- [sighs] Well,
I can't say I understand,

09:39.046 --> 09:43.217
but if this is what makes
you happy, here you go, Grubby.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.286
all: Grubby! Grubby!
Grubby!

09:46.320 --> 09:49.690
Grubby! Grubby! Grubby!

09:49.723 --> 09:54.428
Grubby! Grubby!
Grubby! Grubby! Grubby!

09:54.461 --> 09:55.596
- [gasps]
Oh, my God.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.998
David, it's her.
It's Madame Slingshot.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.333
- What's a Madame Slingshot
now?

09:59.366 --> 10:00.667
- The woman who's been
stalking me. There.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.003
- Her real name is
actually Motorcycle Car Lady.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.738
Wh-where is she?
I don't see her.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.273
Wait a minute.
John, that's Kaydee.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.608
- What? Who?

10:07.641 --> 10:09.610
- Kaydee Festermeyer
from high school, man.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.378
- Kaydee Festermeyer?

10:11.411 --> 10:13.380
Why does that name
sound familiar?

10:13.413 --> 10:15.082
- Oh-ho-ho,
she was a legend.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.650
She cured her own tobacco.

10:16.683 --> 10:19.786
She had, like,
a super-dangerous beehive.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.622
She had a
pet raccoon named Ripper,

10:21.655 --> 10:23.156
who she kept in her locker.

10:23.190 --> 10:26.326
Oh, and her mom glued hair
on the dolls

10:26.360 --> 10:29.363
at the Lettuce Head
Southern Dolls factory.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.999
- Hey, Purefoy,
how the fudge are you?

10:32.032 --> 10:34.735
- Hey, what's up, Kaydee?

10:34.768 --> 10:36.336
- I don't think
your little friend

10:36.370 --> 10:38.605
has been following my clues.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.474
- I think he just
figured it out.

10:40.507 --> 10:42.142
- Don't talk to her
like it's normal.

10:42.176 --> 10:44.378
- The Mystery
of the Golden Lungs.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.046
- It's easy.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.648
If you just follow the clues,
you always get it right.

10:47.681 --> 10:51.318
- In tenth grade the Tobacco
Club's Golden Lungs trophy

10:51.351 --> 10:52.619
was stolen.

10:52.653 --> 10:55.222
You traced it
to Kaydee's locker.

10:55.255 --> 10:58.292
She got suspended,
and no one ever saw her again.

10:58.325 --> 11:01.395
- You know what you did yet,
Hunchman, huh?

11:01.428 --> 11:02.729
You see the big picture?

11:02.763 --> 11:04.998
- No, I don't.
What do you want from me?

11:05.032 --> 11:06.099
What do you want?

11:06.133 --> 11:08.168
- Revenge!

11:08.202 --> 11:10.170
- I hate to say this,

11:10.204 --> 11:12.506
but I think she wants revenge.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.988
Made in Georgia
