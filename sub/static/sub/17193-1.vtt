02:22.586 --> 02:23.886
what's your name, darling?

02:24.639 --> 02:25.828
Annie.

02:29.026 --> 02:30.293
Are you on your own?

02:36.774 --> 02:38.301
Are you on the hop?

03:01.358 --> 03:02.905
Excuse me, sir.

03:06.837 --> 03:08.397
Would you like me to pleasure you?

03:10.117 --> 03:11.862
No. Child.

03:13.371 --> 03:14.871
I don't want that.

03:24.415 --> 03:26.682
Aaaaah!

03:28.919 --> 03:31.988
Move it. Come on, let's go, boys.

03:47.738 --> 03:49.071
Move!

04:18.702 --> 04:20.736
Go. Keep going.

04:40.691 --> 04:43.292
Right on schedule.

04:45.195 --> 04:48.197
Go, Ted, look out.

04:59.776 --> 05:01.877
Police! Drop your weapons!

05:10.487 --> 05:12.455
Jesus

05:12.457 --> 05:14.624
Christ!

05:20.497 --> 05:21.631
Don't shoot!

05:21.633 --> 05:24.500
I give up. Look, here's me gun.

05:58.135 --> 05:59.635
Fine work, Lewis.

05:59.637 --> 06:02.471
Always good to be on the right side of the law.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.781
Christ, we got to be quick.

06:11.783 --> 06:13.349
Take a fistful of coins and run.

06:13.351 --> 06:16.185
God bless you, Detective Corcoran.

06:16.187 --> 06:19.055
Corky, all right if I go have breakfast with my wife?

06:19.057 --> 06:20.389
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

06:20.391 --> 06:23.559
This time, ask her to let you keep some of the loot.

06:23.561 --> 06:25.394
May the pox rot both your dicks.

06:25.396 --> 06:26.562
Mwah.

06:32.869 --> 06:34.470
Caught in the act,

06:34.472 --> 06:36.172
you lousy cur.

06:36.174 --> 06:38.207
When will they learn?

06:38.209 --> 06:40.443
Got you a nice new watch, sergeant.

06:43.313 --> 06:46.248
Maguire, be on your way.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.384
Corcoran and me will watch over this money

06:48.386 --> 06:51.687
'til the cap'n gets here.

06:54.392 --> 06:56.859
Next time,

06:56.861 --> 06:58.360
I'll be leading the apprehension

06:58.362 --> 06:59.862
of the criminals.

06:59.864 --> 07:01.931
This war hero crap don't cut nothing

07:01.933 --> 07:03.432
with me, Corky.

07:03.434 --> 07:05.434
I had a brother like you.

07:05.436 --> 07:07.770
Too smart for his own good.

07:07.772 --> 07:11.073
Got himself knifed in the groin.

07:11.075 --> 07:12.541
Don't be too smart, Boyo.

07:21.818 --> 07:23.252
All these cutthroats dead?

07:23.254 --> 07:24.920
Aye, cap'n. I was just

07:24.922 --> 07:27.389
praising Detective Corcoran for a job well done.

07:27.391 --> 07:29.024
Quite a mess.

07:29.026 --> 07:31.927
You pick up the strays.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.429
You put the bags in my carriage.

07:33.431 --> 07:35.431
Sergeant Byrnes and I

07:35.433 --> 07:36.932
will return this money to the bank.

07:57.821 --> 07:59.522
You're a copper.

08:55.379 --> 08:57.046
Can't you knock?

08:57.048 --> 09:00.082
You want me to knock?

09:00.084 --> 09:03.285
A little courtesy's all I'm asking.

09:03.287 --> 09:06.488
I'm not thinking courteous thoughts right now.

09:20.103 --> 09:23.806
Oh, you're an angel. Oh.

09:42.698 --> 09:44.526
What does Corcoran see

09:44.528 --> 09:46.762
in Eva?

09:46.764 --> 09:50.032
Does she remind him of his mother?

09:52.454 --> 09:53.850
I know this...

09:54.505 --> 09:56.605
she can't possibly remind him of his wife,

09:56.607 --> 09:58.807
that sweet little thing, his Ellen.

10:02.275 --> 10:03.279
Do you think she's going to come back

10:03.281 --> 10:04.780
or do you think she's gone...

10:04.782 --> 10:06.949
stop talking about Kevin's wife.

10:06.951 --> 10:08.450
Do you understand me?

10:11.254 --> 10:12.854
Forgive me, Molly.

10:14.558 --> 10:15.386
Just...

10:16.294 --> 10:18.160
don't be talking about his wife.

10:18.162 --> 10:19.662
Kevin's like my brother.

10:22.065 --> 10:25.768
A girl I know down in new Orleans

10:25.770 --> 10:28.437
wants to bring up some creoles,

10:28.439 --> 10:30.539
open up a joint near the fifth Avenue hotel.

10:30.541 --> 10:33.375
It's a different world

10:33.377 --> 10:36.845
on 23rd street... so many millionaires.

10:36.847 --> 10:38.480
Before the war, there were just a few,

10:38.482 --> 10:42.251
and, now, there's gaggles of them.

10:42.253 --> 10:44.153
Would you like to get rich with me, Corky?

10:44.155 --> 10:46.121
What do you mean by that?

10:47.992 --> 10:49.325
Nothing.

10:49.327 --> 10:51.060
Just a bad dream.

10:51.062 --> 10:54.430
For your captain.

10:55.833 --> 10:57.299
Yes?

10:57.301 --> 10:59.935
There's a body in Cow bay.

11:24.344 --> 11:25.894
I know this girl.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.567
She was hit down hard.

11:32.570 --> 11:34.120
You feeling all right, Kevin?

11:35.332 --> 11:36.376
Why would I be feeling all right,

11:36.501 --> 11:37.971
looking at a dead child?

11:38.647 --> 11:40.473
We'll take her to O'Malley's mortuary.

11:41.885 --> 11:44.187
No. No, not yet.

11:44.494 --> 11:45.537
Help me.

11:51.354 --> 11:53.789
Here, cover her up.

12:12.781 --> 12:14.331
It's a white man.

12:19.783 --> 12:21.650
I recognize him.

12:21.652 --> 12:23.152
Matthew!

12:23.154 --> 12:24.820
Shh, it'll be all right.

12:30.660 --> 12:32.161
What do you want?

12:32.163 --> 12:34.029
I want to know how she died.

12:36.066 --> 12:37.666
$5.

12:37.668 --> 12:39.168
Now, look here, snowball...

12:39.170 --> 12:40.302
$6.

12:40.304 --> 12:42.538
3 now, 3 after.

12:42.540 --> 12:44.206
When will "after" be?

12:44.208 --> 12:47.543
This time tomorrow.

12:47.545 --> 12:53.182
$10 now and you're done by noon.

12:53.184 --> 12:55.751
Well, if this city had a morgue,

12:55.753 --> 12:57.486
like the one in Paris...

13:02.225 --> 13:03.725
evening to you, gentlemen.

13:21.377 --> 13:22.911
Uppity nigger.

13:22.913 --> 13:25.247
He has a right to be. During the war,

13:25.249 --> 13:26.748
he saved my hide at Chancellorsville.

13:26.750 --> 13:28.250
Ah... I knew it.

13:28.252 --> 13:29.751
I would've been there with you,

13:29.753 --> 13:31.253
if it weren't for my eye.

13:31.255 --> 13:32.754
I know you would've.

13:32.756 --> 13:34.256
I'm sure they'd take you now.

13:34.258 --> 13:35.891
Go away! Cigar?

13:35.893 --> 13:37.359
Ah!

13:37.361 --> 13:38.827
Let's go back down the paradise

13:38.829 --> 13:40.329
for a nightcap.

13:40.331 --> 13:41.830
I'm going to head down to the docks.

13:41.832 --> 13:43.232
Kevin.

13:43.234 --> 13:45.801
If McClaugherty's ship had come to port, we'd know.

13:45.803 --> 13:47.102
Are you certain of that?

13:47.104 --> 13:49.104
Since I came home two months ago

13:49.106 --> 13:50.706
and found an empty home,

13:50.708 --> 13:52.274
I ain't certain of anything.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.344
I'll walk with you, then.

14:20.373 --> 14:21.874
All right!

14:21.876 --> 14:23.809
Everybody, give me your attention!

14:25.046 --> 14:26.545
If you should happen to come across

14:26.547 --> 14:28.681
a distinctive gold locket engraved

14:28.683 --> 14:31.517
with the letters e and c on its face.

14:31.519 --> 14:33.085
It might have pictures of a man...

14:33.087 --> 14:35.087
And a little girl on the inside.

14:35.089 --> 14:37.056
Shut up!

14:37.058 --> 14:39.224
Two months, I've been living in this rat's lair

14:39.226 --> 14:41.160
and, all this time, every single day,

14:41.162 --> 14:43.128
he goes on about a goddamn locket.

14:43.130 --> 14:44.997
Enough to make a man weep!

14:44.999 --> 14:46.498
I said, shut up!

14:46.500 --> 14:47.766
Detective Corcoran?

14:47.768 --> 14:49.735
Good morning, Julius.

14:49.737 --> 14:51.637
I'm to bring you to Mr. Morehouse.

15:35.352 --> 15:36.715
Corcoran's your man.

15:36.717 --> 15:39.618
He whipped the 71st regiment into shape

15:39.620 --> 15:41.787
and the Irish were as fiercely loyal to him

15:41.789 --> 15:43.789
as he was to me.

15:43.791 --> 15:45.224
God's truth, he had no reason

15:45.226 --> 15:46.725
to follow my sorry ass.

15:46.727 --> 15:48.727
A Harvard boy, playing major?

15:48.729 --> 15:49.995
I was all theory and ideals.

15:51.432 --> 15:54.967
Detective Corcoran, sir.

15:54.969 --> 15:56.635
Winfred Haverford. How do you do?

15:56.637 --> 15:58.237
It is a pleasure to meet the man

15:58.239 --> 16:00.773
who cut off Robert Morehouse's leg.

16:00.775 --> 16:02.441
Cut off my leg and saved my life.

16:02.443 --> 16:04.309
A perfect, precise, clean cut.

16:04.311 --> 16:05.811
My surgeons were extremely impressed.

16:05.813 --> 16:08.447
Luck of the Irish.

16:08.449 --> 16:11.283
Always so modest, Corky. He saved my life

16:11.285 --> 16:12.985
and got himself a detective's badge.

16:12.987 --> 16:14.486
If you'd have brought me back dead, my father

16:14.488 --> 16:15.988
would've had the mayor make you a count.

16:17.158 --> 16:18.791
Sit. How about a whiskey?

16:18.793 --> 16:20.526
No, thank you.

16:20.528 --> 16:23.328
Winfred is staging a prizefight

16:23.330 --> 16:25.164
on Staten Island.

16:25.166 --> 16:27.099
He needs a respected former pugilist,

16:27.101 --> 16:29.701
such as yourself; Of unimpeachable integrity,

16:29.703 --> 16:31.336
such as yourself; To referee the match.

16:31.338 --> 16:33.939
And I, of course, thought of you.

16:33.941 --> 16:35.974
I always call a clean and straight fight.

16:35.976 --> 16:37.476
I promise you that.

16:37.478 --> 16:40.379
I saw you knock out Mike McCool in '58.

16:40.381 --> 16:41.814
63 rounds.

16:41.816 --> 16:44.349
God almighty, it was amazing.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.617
Well, it turns out

16:45.619 --> 16:46.985
it wasn't the real Mike McCool.

16:48.722 --> 16:51.056
If that'll be all, major, I have business to do.

16:51.058 --> 16:52.925
There is one more item.

16:56.930 --> 16:58.297
That ship, the <i>Gantelope,</i>

16:58.299 --> 17:00.332
in which you're always so interested.

17:00.334 --> 17:02.067
Well, the harbormaster tells me

17:02.069 --> 17:04.002
she's due back in port any day now.

17:04.003 --> 17:05.904
With Tungus McClaugherty onboard?

17:05.906 --> 17:07.306
Who knows?

17:07.308 --> 17:09.074
The bastard may have been lost at sea.

17:12.422 --> 17:13.377
Thank you.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.012
Peculiar.

17:15.015 --> 17:16.515
Stain deep in the skin,

17:16.517 --> 17:18.983
calluses.

17:18.986 --> 17:21.019
I doubt the child ever owned a pair of shoes,

17:21.021 --> 17:22.521
but she is very clean.

17:22.522 --> 17:23.922
Her scalp? Somebody even

17:23.924 --> 17:25.324
combed jasmine all through her hair.

17:25.326 --> 17:26.758
Yesterday, when I saw her

17:26.760 --> 17:28.727
at the stables, she looked like hell.

17:28.729 --> 17:30.229
Well, somebody dolled her up

17:30.231 --> 17:32.097
between then and the time of death.

17:32.099 --> 17:34.833
Her vagina was bespoiled with semen.

17:34.835 --> 17:36.468
I also examined the hymen, which was

17:36.470 --> 17:39.271
newly bruised, but the skin did not bleed,

17:39.273 --> 17:42.841
meaning she was deflowered <i>after</i> she was killed.

17:42.843 --> 17:46.278
She was a virgin?

17:46.280 --> 17:48.881
Yes.

17:48.883 --> 17:51.650
She offered to, uh,

17:51.652 --> 17:53.585
pleasure me for an egg yesterday.

17:53.587 --> 17:55.454
Well, she died a virgin,

17:55.456 --> 17:57.623
from a single blow to the head.

17:57.625 --> 17:59.691
This mark here, you can see it,

17:59.693 --> 18:01.894
shaped like some type of ornament.

18:01.896 --> 18:03.395
You can see it's starting to fade,

18:03.397 --> 18:05.631
so I made a sketch.

18:10.870 --> 18:12.738
Any guesses as to what the shape's supposed to be?

18:12.740 --> 18:14.439
Damned if I know, but the sketch is

18:14.441 --> 18:15.941
the actual size of the wound.

18:15.943 --> 18:18.377
Can you figure out what she was hit with?

18:18.379 --> 18:21.914
Can I? Yes. Will I? No.

18:21.916 --> 18:23.415
Today is moving day.

18:23.417 --> 18:25.584
You're moving? To where?

18:25.586 --> 18:27.186
Just up north of the new park.

18:27.188 --> 18:28.420
Carmansville.

18:28.422 --> 18:29.788
So far away?

18:29.790 --> 18:31.223
Not so far, now... railroad put in

18:31.225 --> 18:32.624
a station at 157th and Amsterdam.

18:32.626 --> 18:33.792
Even so.

18:33.794 --> 18:35.294
Look around you, Corky.

18:35.296 --> 18:36.795
Since the riots, my people have been

18:36.797 --> 18:39.665
moving out of five points.

18:39.667 --> 18:42.467
My wife?

18:42.469 --> 18:44.136
Her brothers were hung by the neck

18:44.138 --> 18:45.804
from that very lamppost.

18:45.806 --> 18:48.840
The Irish mob burned the two bodies.

18:48.842 --> 18:51.243
She never got to bury her brothers.

18:51.245 --> 18:53.312
She remembers the screams.

18:53.314 --> 18:59.151
We've all of us heard screams, Matthew.

18:59.153 --> 19:02.020
I'm off to see Dr. Grimes

19:02.022 --> 19:05.090
to verify your findings.

19:05.092 --> 19:06.792
You're not going to tell him it was me, are you?

19:06.794 --> 19:09.428
If you do, he'll deny what's in front of his eyes.

19:09.430 --> 19:11.930
I'll say what I always say...

19:11.932 --> 19:14.266
<i>I'm</i> the genius.

19:14.268 --> 19:15.767
And then, I'll take her

19:15.769 --> 19:17.936
to O'Malley's funeral parlor.

19:54.140 --> 19:55.641
Oh! Watch where you're going!

19:55.643 --> 19:57.976
Annie? Annie!

19:57.978 --> 19:59.911
Annie!

19:59.913 --> 20:02.714
Get out of the way! Move!

20:02.716 --> 20:05.484
Annie, where are you?!

20:05.486 --> 20:07.819
Annie!

20:10.156 --> 20:12.224
Annie!

20:12.226 --> 20:14.393
I'll never go off with you again, ever!

20:15.562 --> 20:18.363
Annie?

20:18.365 --> 20:19.765
Hey, Annie?

20:23.703 --> 20:25.504
You got another egg for me, handsome?

20:27.073 --> 20:28.674
Who is this, Annie?

20:33.947 --> 20:35.280
Annie.

20:35.282 --> 20:36.915
Annie, look at me! Annie, who is this?!

20:36.917 --> 20:39.351
Annie! Who do you think you are?

20:40.953 --> 20:42.120
Ohh!

20:44.390 --> 20:46.458
I'm the police, you stupid bastard.

20:57.370 --> 20:59.304
Annie! Annie!

20:59.306 --> 21:00.939
Vera.

21:00.941 --> 21:03.075
Vera, come along, dear, come.

21:16.251 --> 21:20.271
Ah. Good evening, Mr. Morehouse.

21:20.605 --> 21:21.838
Bill.

21:24.842 --> 21:27.110
Welcome, sir, to Contessa Popadou's.

21:27.112 --> 21:28.978
Thank you.

21:32.050 --> 21:34.984
Ladies.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.402
Monsieur M.

21:44.629 --> 21:46.129
Always a pleasure.

21:46.131 --> 21:47.664
Contessa.

21:57.041 --> 21:58.274
Ah.

22:08.152 --> 22:10.286
Monsieur Morehouse.

22:10.288 --> 22:11.688
One minute.

22:11.690 --> 22:14.090
I have a special lady

22:14.092 --> 22:15.592
for our special guest.

22:23.934 --> 22:25.969
Come in.

22:36.180 --> 22:39.215
Andrew.

22:39.217 --> 22:42.252
You think Molly could be a wife?

22:42.254 --> 22:44.220
You think she could be capable of that?

22:44.222 --> 22:45.722
You're considering a marriage

22:45.724 --> 22:47.223
to that trollop?

22:47.225 --> 22:48.358
I dunno.

22:48.360 --> 22:51.694
Molly's got a way about her.

22:51.696 --> 22:53.396
I wonder what she'd be like

22:53.398 --> 22:54.898
if I took her away from all that chintz.

22:54.900 --> 22:56.733
And where, on God's green earth,

22:56.735 --> 22:58.201
would you be taking her away to?

22:58.203 --> 23:00.270
I could buy an acre, do a bit of farming.

23:00.272 --> 23:02.839
A month of plowing,

23:02.841 --> 23:05.074
you'd slit your own throat.

23:05.076 --> 23:07.443
All done here, Kevin.

23:07.445 --> 23:09.178
Shall we say a prayer?

23:09.180 --> 23:11.314
No. I want you two to go find Annie.

23:11.316 --> 23:13.149
Why? Why waste our time?

23:13.151 --> 23:15.184
We solve murders, Andrew.

23:15.186 --> 23:16.986
Annie may lead us to this girl's killer.

23:16.988 --> 23:18.488
And I don't want Annie,

23:18.490 --> 23:19.989
or any other child, to be next.

23:19.991 --> 23:21.624
Finding this girl's killer

23:21.626 --> 23:23.393
isn't going to bring your daughter back.

23:23.395 --> 23:24.494
Shut up.

23:24.496 --> 23:26.462
I'll search for Annie, Kevin.

23:26.464 --> 23:28.131
Soon as we make the collections.

23:28.133 --> 23:30.199
Captain's tax comes first. You know that.

23:30.201 --> 23:31.701
All right, you two take off.

23:31.703 --> 23:33.703
I'll track down Annie myself.

24:07.504 --> 24:09.339
Annie?

24:15.446 --> 24:16.779
Annie.

24:18.383 --> 24:19.515
It's okay. Stop it.

24:19.517 --> 24:21.117
Don't hurt me!

24:21.119 --> 24:22.719
Please! Don't kill me!

24:22.721 --> 24:23.886
Annie.

24:23.888 --> 24:25.388
Annie, I'm not going to hurt you.

24:25.390 --> 24:27.523
Annie! I'm not going to hurt you.

24:27.525 --> 24:29.058
Please don't hurt me!

24:29.060 --> 24:31.127
Annie. Annie! I'm not...

24:31.129 --> 24:32.628
I'm not going to hurt you, Annie.

24:33.732 --> 24:37.500
It's okay. It's okay.

24:39.437 --> 24:41.471
It's okay. It's okay.

24:41.473 --> 24:44.240
When pa died,

24:44.242 --> 24:47.010
me and my sister Kate were alone.

24:47.012 --> 24:49.545
I was begging in front of

24:49.547 --> 24:52.115
contessa popadou's house.

24:52.117 --> 24:55.385
She invited me in. She was so kind.

24:55.387 --> 24:57.887
Soon, I learned

24:57.889 --> 25:00.323
the reason for her kindness.

25:00.325 --> 25:03.026
A certain kind of gentleman

25:03.028 --> 25:08.898
will pay a high price for girls my age.

25:08.900 --> 25:15.738
10 days, I was a prisoner.

25:15.740 --> 25:17.473
Then, glancing out the window,

25:17.475 --> 25:20.176
I saw my sister searching for me.

25:20.178 --> 25:21.844
The Contessa was standing right behind,

25:21.846 --> 25:23.379
said Kate should come live with us.

25:23.381 --> 25:24.781
I said no.

25:24.783 --> 25:26.282
The Contessa threatened to send me

25:26.284 --> 25:27.784
to Blackwell's Island...

25:27.786 --> 25:29.452
don't worry about the Contessa.

25:29.454 --> 25:30.686
I'm going to be paying her a visit.

25:30.688 --> 25:32.455
Corky will crack her French head.

25:32.457 --> 25:33.923
Tsk.

25:35.092 --> 25:38.995
I didn't want to go to Blackwell's Island.

25:38.997 --> 25:43.132
So, two days ago, I saw Kate again

25:43.134 --> 25:45.601
and yelled for her to come to the house

25:45.603 --> 25:48.571
and, when the Contessa

25:48.573 --> 25:52.175
was distracted with my sister,

25:52.177 --> 25:54.410
I ran away.

25:57.047 --> 25:59.582
Was there

25:59.584 --> 26:01.417
one particular man

26:01.419 --> 26:04.253
who preferred little girls?

26:05.857 --> 26:07.623
Annie.

26:07.625 --> 26:09.058
Answer me.

26:09.060 --> 26:11.727
Leave her be.

26:11.729 --> 26:13.329
Molly's going to give you a hot bath

26:13.331 --> 26:14.831
in your own room.

26:14.833 --> 26:16.766
And you're going to sleep for a long time.

26:16.768 --> 26:19.435
That sound good?

26:19.437 --> 26:20.937
We're going to keep you safe

26:20.939 --> 26:22.438
until you're healthy again.

26:22.440 --> 26:23.940
So you don't have to be afraid,

26:23.942 --> 26:25.575
all right?

26:25.577 --> 26:27.243
Some along, hon.

26:27.245 --> 26:29.412
You're in a gentler joint, I promise you.

26:36.453 --> 26:38.588
General McClellan did not seek the presidency,

26:38.590 --> 26:40.223
but was forced to accept it by <i>acclamation.</i>

26:40.225 --> 26:42.458
You know that the emancipation proclamation

26:42.460 --> 26:44.560
has put fear in the hearts of the Irish.

26:44.562 --> 26:46.229
They're <i>terrified</i> <i>that the negroes</i>

26:46.231 --> 26:48.431
will come north and steal all their jobs.

26:48.433 --> 26:51.067
All Tammany Hall must do is get

26:51.069 --> 26:53.436
the Irish to the polls, drunk or sober.

26:53.438 --> 26:55.505
I predict McClellan will carry the city.

26:55.507 --> 26:56.906
Remarkable.

26:56.908 --> 26:58.908
So do I.

26:58.910 --> 27:00.042
Winnie, do you know how lucky you are,

27:00.044 --> 27:02.778
to have wed a woman not only politically astute,

27:02.780 --> 27:05.014
but brilliantly articulate as well?

27:05.016 --> 27:07.617
That is why I imported her from England.

27:08.853 --> 27:11.687
Little good does being astute do me.

27:11.689 --> 27:14.390
Prussian ruffians and fenian louts

27:14.392 --> 27:15.892
can mark their ballot with an x,

27:15.894 --> 27:18.127
but I, being a woman,

27:18.129 --> 27:20.163
do not have that right.

27:20.165 --> 27:21.697
How about I give you my vote?

27:21.699 --> 27:24.066
I was favoring Frémont.

27:24.068 --> 27:25.301
Frémont?

27:25.303 --> 27:26.502
What?

27:26.504 --> 27:28.070
Now, there's a dark horse.

27:28.072 --> 27:29.505
If your father heard that you

27:29.507 --> 27:30.973
were supporting Frémont, he would spit nails.

27:30.975 --> 27:33.476
And how do you know what my father would do?

27:33.478 --> 27:36.012
He is Norbert Morehouse, after all.

27:38.682 --> 27:41.918
Yes, he is.

27:41.920 --> 27:44.420
I'm off to New Orleans to inspect the Creoles.

27:44.422 --> 27:46.122
Through enemy lines.

27:46.124 --> 27:47.924
I've got two passes,

27:47.926 --> 27:49.392
one signed by President Lincoln,

27:49.394 --> 27:50.893
the other by President Davis.

27:50.895 --> 27:55.031
You're not the only one with fancy friends.

27:55.033 --> 27:57.567
I'll be gone a week or so.

27:57.569 --> 28:01.470
Don't use too many of the girls.

28:01.472 --> 28:03.606
You're the only one I want.

28:17.888 --> 28:20.323
I'm done upstairs with the...

28:22.492 --> 28:24.460
why are you unpacking?

28:24.462 --> 28:27.263
Before we go, there's something I must do.

28:27.265 --> 28:28.531
Matthew.

28:28.533 --> 28:30.032
It won't take but a while.

28:30.034 --> 28:31.601
You head up to the new place with the Monroes.

28:31.603 --> 28:33.102
I'll come in a few hours.

28:33.104 --> 28:35.104
That man, Corcoran, is evil.

28:35.106 --> 28:37.540
No. He's our friend.

28:48.453 --> 28:49.619
Hyup.

28:49.621 --> 28:51.454
We're all paid up, copper.

28:51.456 --> 28:53.055
You got no business here.

28:53.057 --> 28:54.490
I just need to speak to the Contessa

28:54.492 --> 28:55.925
for a moment, Bill, about a murder.

28:55.927 --> 28:57.627
Well, anything you've got to say

28:57.629 --> 28:59.428
to the lady, I'll pass on

28:59.430 --> 29:01.163
as a service to the police.

29:01.165 --> 29:04.333
Well, this little girl,

29:04.335 --> 29:06.035
this beautiful,

29:06.037 --> 29:08.571
beautiful little girl, um,

29:08.573 --> 29:11.240
somebody cleaned her up,

29:11.242 --> 29:12.742
combed some oil in her hair,

29:12.744 --> 29:14.243
and then killed the poor child.

29:14.245 --> 29:17.246
Bashed her head.

29:17.248 --> 29:20.283
Now, why would somebody...

29:20.285 --> 29:22.184
why would somebody do that, Bill?

29:22.186 --> 29:24.620
Maybe she had it coming, eh?

29:26.923 --> 29:28.891
Evening.

29:43.507 --> 29:46.475
You and me,

29:46.477 --> 29:48.044
we're going to talk about that little girl.

30:45.802 --> 30:47.303
You know everything that goes on

30:47.305 --> 30:48.738
in the bowels of that whorehouse!

30:56.146 --> 30:57.613
Tell me who killed that little girl!

31:01.063 --> 31:02.187
I've been thinking about it, Bill.

31:03.189 --> 31:04.688
You're the kind who'd rape the little girl

31:04.690 --> 31:06.190
after you beat her to death.

31:06.192 --> 31:08.025
Why don't you unchain me, huh?

31:08.027 --> 31:09.626
Accuse me
man-to-man!

31:09.628 --> 31:11.495
Oh,
man-to-man?

31:11.497 --> 31:12.496
Aye.

31:12.498 --> 31:14.231
You want a fair fight?

31:14.233 --> 31:15.632
Ach! Ahh!

31:15.634 --> 31:17.568
You're talking to the wrong...

31:17.570 --> 31:19.136
ah!

31:19.138 --> 31:20.637
Ohh!

31:22.808 --> 31:25.109
I didn't kill no bloody little girl!

31:45.396 --> 31:47.364
You want a boiled egg?

31:47.366 --> 31:48.832
I'll take one for my wife.

31:48.834 --> 31:51.001
She likes eggs.

31:51.003 --> 31:52.970
The girl was killed with a walking stick.

31:52.972 --> 31:56.373
Well, the girl's name was Kate.

31:56.375 --> 31:58.842
The head of the walking stick was made of something

31:58.844 --> 32:00.778
equal or greater in density than bone.

32:00.780 --> 32:03.046
Maybe silver, maybe ivory.

32:03.048 --> 32:07.518
"The blow was struck by a man

32:07.520 --> 32:10.020
approximately 6'0 " tall."

32:10.022 --> 32:12.256
Bill Longin is

32:12.258 --> 32:15.526
a good 6 inches taller than 6'0".

32:15.528 --> 32:17.161
Who is Bill Longin?

32:17.163 --> 32:21.031
You sure about this?

32:21.033 --> 32:22.633
Couldn't someone taller have been bending down

32:22.635 --> 32:24.134
or kneeling, or something?

32:24.136 --> 32:25.702
Then the angle would be different.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.274
Well, damn me to hell.

32:32.778 --> 32:35.078
It's all right.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.180
Shh!

32:39.250 --> 32:41.451
You didn't kill that girl.

32:41.453 --> 32:45.823
They're going to hang me for it, anyway.

32:45.825 --> 32:47.958
No one's going to hang you, Bill.

32:49.728 --> 32:51.161
Just tell me what happened

32:51.163 --> 32:52.596
at the Contessa's that night.

32:52.598 --> 32:54.031
Come on, Corky, be honest.

32:54.033 --> 32:56.133
Would you betray her trust, eh?

33:01.606 --> 33:03.874
Yes, yes, I made that cane.

33:03.876 --> 33:06.376
The head of a
wolf. One-of-a-kind.

33:06.378 --> 33:07.711
Anniversary gift.

33:07.713 --> 33:09.613
Given by who to who?

33:09.615 --> 33:11.281
I'm not at liberty to say.

33:11.283 --> 33:13.750
This is a police investigation, sir.

33:13.752 --> 33:16.687
My clientele is of the highest order.

33:16.689 --> 33:18.455
You can talk

33:18.457 --> 33:20.591
or you can pray.

33:20.593 --> 33:21.892
Haverford.

33:21.894 --> 33:23.293
Winfred Haverford.

33:26.564 --> 33:28.065
Deliveries out back.

33:28.067 --> 33:29.566
Mr. Haverford, please.

33:29.568 --> 33:32.436
Detective Corcoran, Metropolitan police.

33:32.438 --> 33:33.937
I will inquire.

33:38.076 --> 33:40.844
There's a Detective Corcoran here to see you.

33:40.846 --> 33:42.446
What does he want?

33:42.448 --> 33:43.881
He didn't say.

33:43.883 --> 33:45.682
Send him away.

33:59.597 --> 34:04.334
The cane belongs to Winfred Haverford.

34:04.336 --> 34:06.837
He told the Contessa that the girl fell,

34:06.839 --> 34:08.338
hit her head.

34:08.340 --> 34:10.040
But I went over the wound on her skull

34:10.042 --> 34:11.475
with a magnifying glass

34:11.476 --> 34:12.909
and made a drawing of the mark,

34:12.911 --> 34:14.878
which matches the head

34:14.880 --> 34:17.848
of Haverford's walking stick.

34:17.850 --> 34:20.350
And...

34:20.351 --> 34:22.319
Dr. Grimes at St. Vincent's

34:22.321 --> 34:24.588
makes notice of the mark as well.

34:24.590 --> 34:27.491
Winfred Haverford.

34:27.493 --> 34:28.992
You didn't talk to any reporters?

34:28.994 --> 34:32.529
Of course not, cap'n.

34:32.531 --> 34:36.800
Of course not.

34:36.802 --> 34:39.870
What a world we live in, eh, detective?

34:39.871 --> 34:41.605
That the body of a young girl

34:41.607 --> 34:44.641
could be so brutally used

34:44.643 --> 34:47.043
and discarded so easily.

34:47.045 --> 34:49.313
Yes, sir.

34:49.315 --> 34:51.281
And, uh, with your permission...

34:51.283 --> 34:52.783
sergeant Byrnes and I will be

34:52.784 --> 34:54.518
taking charge of this investigation.

34:54.520 --> 34:56.652
That'll be all.

34:56.655 --> 34:59.823
Admirable work, detective.

35:04.295 --> 35:06.563
Yes.

35:06.565 --> 35:09.099
Admirable work, Boyo.

Detective Corcoran, sir.

36:48.564 --> 36:49.511
Here's the sleuth

36:49.636 --> 36:52.135
who practices modern scientific methods of deduction.

36:52.320 --> 36:54.687
I think he's rather ingenuous, really,

36:54.689 --> 36:56.188
figuring out your walking stick

36:56.190 --> 36:58.390
was the murder weapon.

36:58.392 --> 36:59.892
Explain to the detective.

37:00.751 --> 37:04.274
Last night, Bill Longin confessed to the murder of Kate Reilly.

37:06.233 --> 37:07.733
Mr. Haverford was a victim

37:07.735 --> 37:09.735
of the panel game at the Contessa's house.

37:09.737 --> 37:11.236
Do you know how

37:11.238 --> 37:12.738
the panel game works, detective?

37:12.740 --> 37:14.540
I know how the panel game works.

37:14.542 --> 37:16.008
I wasn't aware that the Contessa

37:16.010 --> 37:17.142
was a practitioner.

37:17.144 --> 37:18.644
We weren't aware of it

37:18.646 --> 37:20.212
because she was getting away with it.

37:20.214 --> 37:23.148
While Mr. Haverford was being, um,

37:23.150 --> 37:24.817
entertained

37:24.819 --> 37:27.353
by <i>two</i> <i>lovely ladies,</i>

37:27.355 --> 37:29.822
Longin was going through Mr. Haverford's clothes

37:29.824 --> 37:32.057
and the child interrupted.

37:32.059 --> 37:33.726
The girl screamed and Longin hit her

37:33.728 --> 37:36.161
with Mr. Haverford's stick.

37:36.163 --> 37:39.331
The case is closed, detective.

37:39.333 --> 37:42.968
Bill Longin will hang and a fine

37:42.970 --> 37:44.470
will be levied on the Contessa.

37:50.344 --> 37:51.844
Ah, justice.

37:51.846 --> 37:54.680
Winnie was understandably quite upset

37:54.682 --> 37:56.181
to have been suspected

37:56.183 --> 37:59.084
of such a reprehensible deed.

37:59.086 --> 38:01.286
His good name, and all.

38:01.288 --> 38:02.788
He wanted to have you dismissed,

38:02.790 --> 38:04.957
but father said no.

38:04.959 --> 38:08.360
After all, you quite competently,

38:08.362 --> 38:10.095
and quite discreetly,

38:10.097 --> 38:12.564
gathered the evidence and presented it

38:12.566 --> 38:15.501
to your superiors to be judiciously evaluated.

38:15.503 --> 38:17.002
Father says you're to be commended.

38:18.805 --> 38:21.707
Bravo.

38:25.813 --> 38:29.381
One more item, detective.

38:29.383 --> 38:31.850
The Contessa once told me

38:31.852 --> 38:34.119
that the girl has a...

38:34.121 --> 38:37.089
a sister, a twin, name of Annie.

38:37.091 --> 38:38.590
Where is she?

38:38.592 --> 38:41.927
I put her in the convent of St. Brenda's,

38:41.929 --> 38:43.429
with the nuns.

38:43.431 --> 38:46.098
Good.

38:46.100 --> 38:48.200
I only want what's best for the child.

39:01.014 --> 39:02.848
Thank you.

39:08.188 --> 39:10.089
Anybody comes asking about her,

39:10.091 --> 39:11.657
you fetch me right away.

39:11.659 --> 39:13.425
You can count on me, Kevin.

39:18.498 --> 39:19.998
Where you going?

39:20.000 --> 39:23.535
See a dead man.

39:31.845 --> 39:33.078
You're dead!

39:33.080 --> 39:34.480
C'mere, copper, c'mere, so I can break your face!

39:34.482 --> 39:35.848
Shut up, you scum!

39:35.850 --> 39:37.750
Bill!

39:37.752 --> 39:39.184
Bend over, Corcoran, I got a present for ya!

39:39.186 --> 39:43.822
Detective Corcoran, ha ha. Come on in.

39:43.824 --> 39:45.657
Awfully sorry about this, Bill.

39:45.659 --> 39:47.526
Oh, don't be.

39:47.528 --> 39:49.561
The situation turned out to be

39:49.563 --> 39:52.531
a very good thing for me.

39:52.533 --> 39:54.399
Have a drink with me, pally.

39:54.401 --> 39:56.735
Well, ain't this a pig living in muck, eh?

39:56.737 --> 39:58.237
Yes, it is.

40:06.346 --> 40:09.381
If you'd have told me last night

40:09.383 --> 40:10.883
that we'd be sipping Brandy

40:10.885 --> 40:12.518
and smoking cigars,

40:12.520 --> 40:14.953
I'd have told thee to lick my arse.

40:14.955 --> 40:18.090
Bill, I could slip you out, get you to Boston.

40:18.092 --> 40:19.591
Wouldn't be hard to do.

40:19.593 --> 40:21.960
Don't bother thyself, lad.

40:21.962 --> 40:26.665
Truth is, me liver's shot, aye.

40:26.667 --> 40:28.167
Doc Claggett gives me less than a year.

40:28.169 --> 40:31.703
So you're just going to let them

40:31.705 --> 40:33.739
hang you for this girl's murder?

40:33.741 --> 40:36.208
Do you know what's bloody priceless?

40:36.210 --> 40:38.210
I get to live like the king of Siam

40:38.212 --> 40:40.012
for a month,

40:40.014 --> 40:42.447
me Sophie gets $5,000,

40:42.449 --> 40:45.184
and, best of all,

40:45.186 --> 40:47.019
the public gets the satisfaction

40:47.021 --> 40:49.254
of seeing someone hang for this heinous crime.

40:49.256 --> 40:50.989
The public ought to see the man

40:50.991 --> 40:53.125
who actually committed this heinous crime

40:53.127 --> 40:54.626
hang for it.

40:54.628 --> 40:56.061
Never gonna happen, copper.

40:56.063 --> 40:57.563
You know this stretch of road.

40:57.565 --> 41:00.199
Things are different for people like them

41:00.201 --> 41:01.700
than they are for people like us

41:01.702 --> 41:05.270
and there's bloody naught we can do about it.

41:05.272 --> 41:08.407
Come on, what is it your people say?

41:08.409 --> 41:09.975
<i>Sláinte.</i>

41:27.026 --> 41:29.528
Hey, give me some of that.

41:29.530 --> 41:32.164
Get off.

41:50.650 --> 41:52.251
Ellen?

41:58.124 --> 42:02.261
You here to berate me

42:02.263 --> 42:04.229
for accusing your husband?

42:04.231 --> 42:06.131
I'm here for the truth.

42:06.133 --> 42:08.667
Did Winfred kill that little girl?

42:08.669 --> 42:11.169
Yes.

42:11.171 --> 42:15.440
And he had his way with her?

42:15.442 --> 42:19.611
He did.

42:26.319 --> 42:28.820
Promise me

42:28.822 --> 42:32.157
Kate Reilly's murder will be avenged.

43:26.914 --> 43:28.013
Tell me about Kevin Corcoran.

43:28.015 --> 43:29.481
Where's my wife?

43:29.483 --> 43:31.616
Is he prone to violence?

43:31.618 --> 43:33.285
Your friend Corcoran is beneath contempt.

43:33.287 --> 43:35.654
Which puts him one level above you.

43:35.656 --> 43:37.723
I saw a white men outside on horses.

43:37.725 --> 43:39.057
Don't shoot!

43:39.059 --> 43:40.726
I want to buy five points.

43:40.728 --> 43:42.027
Buy five points? Why?

43:42.029 --> 43:43.729
Who are ya? I'm her father.

43:43.731 --> 43:46.164
Your father's not dead. Mr. Reilly was here?

43:46.166 --> 43:47.632
Why do you care about that little tramp so much?

43:47.634 --> 43:48.700
Why do you?

43:48.702 --> 43:51.036
May God repay Winfred for all his deeds.
