00:18.485 --> 00:19.985

00:19.987 --> 00:21.487
MIKE: Looks like
it's just you and me, bud.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.188
I'm the father of her child.
Not anymore.

00:23.190 --> 00:26.692
Everybody's life got worse
the day they met you.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.994
I guess we can't
trust each other.
I guess not.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.195
Where were you?

00:30.197 --> 00:32.297
Oh, farts.

00:32.299 --> 00:33.499
Oh, hi, Phil's penis.

00:33.501 --> 00:34.566
Out helping Phil.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.002
Tandy!

00:37.004 --> 00:39.071
(snoring)

00:50.417 --> 00:51.884
(grunts)

00:51.886 --> 00:53.318
Get away from me!

00:53.320 --> 00:54.686
But you... Come on.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.321
Get away from
me, Tandy!

00:56.323 --> 00:58.590
I'm just trying to get you
ready for your big unveiling.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.192
I know what you're
going through right now.
(cow bellows)

01:00.194 --> 01:02.261
You're disoriented,
you're angry...

01:02.263 --> 01:03.429
Damn right, I'm angry!

01:03.431 --> 01:04.763
But you did the right thing

01:04.765 --> 01:07.166
by getting drunk enough to let
me get you into these stocks.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.333
And that's really
gonna score

01:08.335 --> 01:10.002
a bunch of points
with the group, okay?

01:10.004 --> 01:11.403
You ready?
(cow bellows)

01:11.405 --> 01:12.704
Okay, this is
a big moment.
What?

01:12.706 --> 01:14.106
Here we go.
(shouts)
(pot clanging)

01:14.108 --> 01:15.574
Hey, everyone,
come out here!

01:15.576 --> 01:16.708
Get me out of here.

01:16.710 --> 01:17.676
Some really
exciting stuff!

01:17.678 --> 01:19.078
PHIL 2:
Stop it!

01:19.080 --> 01:20.946
TANDY: Phil somehow
put himself in the stocks!

01:20.948 --> 01:22.581
No, I didn't!
It's amazing, right?

01:22.583 --> 01:24.783
What do you mean,
no, you didn't? Yeah, you did.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.952
You're in there right now.
I clearly didn't do it.

01:26.954 --> 01:29.088
What... I'm holding a pot
and something in this hand.

01:29.090 --> 01:30.289
I couldn't have done it.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.790
Wow, we are really
using these things

01:31.792 --> 01:33.459
on a weekly basis now.

01:33.461 --> 01:34.960
If you ask me,
it's too little, too late.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.595
Or do you mean
the exact right amount

01:36.597 --> 01:38.630
at the exact
right time? Hmm?

01:38.632 --> 01:40.365
Erica, Erica,
what do you think, huh?

01:40.367 --> 01:42.568
Pretty cool.
(cow bellowing)

01:42.570 --> 01:45.471
What the goll dang is
up with that cow, huh?

01:45.473 --> 01:47.272
TODD: Oh, my goodness,
guys, get out here!

01:47.274 --> 01:48.440
You got to see this!

01:48.442 --> 01:49.875
No, the show's
in the atrium!

01:49.877 --> 01:51.043
Come on!

01:51.045 --> 01:52.478
Ugh, God.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.079
Okay, I need to go
see what the hell's

01:54.081 --> 01:55.114
going on out there.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.516
Oh, my...
Wow.
Whoa.

02:03.823 --> 02:05.290
(moos)

02:05.292 --> 02:08.460
Holy cow.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.528
Boom.

02:12.932 --> 02:14.166
Hey, little guy or gal.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.401
Not sure what you are,
but you are cute.

02:16.403 --> 02:17.803
Oh, you're a guy. Okay.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.139
Can tell by the...
the penis. Yeah.

02:20.141 --> 02:22.407
Did you guys hear those
noises she was making?

02:22.409 --> 02:24.576
It s-sounded like
she saw the devil.

02:24.578 --> 02:27.579
Yeah, well, she was going
through excruciating pain,

02:27.581 --> 02:29.982
what with the tearing
and the ripping,

02:29.984 --> 02:32.484
and cows don't have doctors
to sew them up.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.621
(clicks tongue)
Oh, I guess we don't either.

02:35.623 --> 02:36.588
Guys, you know what this means?

02:36.590 --> 02:37.856
I mean, there must be
a bull around.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.359
Hey, yeah. Remember when
we first moved in here,

02:40.361 --> 02:42.794
and she'd keep sneaking out
in the middle of the night?

02:42.796 --> 02:44.596
Ah, she was just going off
to do a little

02:44.598 --> 02:47.032
"wham, bam, thank you,
livestock," weren't you?

02:47.034 --> 02:49.268
You little hussy.
TODD: We got to find this bull.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.170
I mean, if we can
get them to mate...

02:51.172 --> 02:52.538
Oh, my God, you are obsessed

02:52.540 --> 02:54.039
with everyone having
more and more babies!

02:54.041 --> 02:56.308
What? I'm talking about
milk, Melissa. Geez!

02:56.310 --> 02:58.677
For those of you who aren't
gonna jump down my throat every

02:58.679 --> 03:00.512
time I say something, how about
we go out looking for the bull?

03:00.514 --> 03:03.182
TANDY: Sounds like a pretty
good idea, sure.
(others agree)

03:03.184 --> 03:04.983
Uh, all right, let's
meet up in about an hour.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.386
That'll give me some time
to gather some gear,

03:07.388 --> 03:08.820
collect some cow urine.

03:08.822 --> 03:09.888
Got to stay hydrated.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.357
Uh, no, bulls are
attracted to cow urine.

03:13.459 --> 03:15.394
Kinky badinky.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.495
(bellows)

03:16.497 --> 03:17.796
TODD: All right,
let's do this, huh?

03:17.798 --> 03:18.897
All right.
Come on.

03:21.301 --> 03:22.701
Those sounds.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.469
Yeah, that's the ripping.

03:24.471 --> 03:26.205
(clicks tongue)
Lucky duck.

03:28.474 --> 03:29.641
TANDY:
Hey, bud.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.009
You are not gonna
believe this.

03:31.011 --> 03:33.011
The cow had a
friggin' calf.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.513
Yeah, a little boy.

03:34.515 --> 03:35.914
You can tell
by the penis.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.883
Oh, cutest thing
you've ever seen.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.418
Uh, the calf,
not the penis.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.253
(chuckles) I mean, it was
a fine-looking penis.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.922
Why do you keep asking me
about this calf's penis?

03:43.924 --> 03:45.157
(chuckles)
Dirty mind.

03:45.159 --> 03:46.992
They don't care
that I'm in here.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.827
So just let me out.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.230
Uh, sure, the calf stole
the headline today.

03:51.232 --> 03:53.232
Okay, but soon that
buzz will wear off,

03:53.234 --> 03:55.033
and they'll focus
on you in here.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.102
Nobody cares about me.

03:57.104 --> 03:59.504
Hey, like it or not,
we're a family.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.106
And you never
give up on family.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.108
Took me a long time
to learn that.

04:03.110 --> 04:06.178
And one of these days,
you're gonna learn that, too.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.380
Uh, Tandy.

04:08.382 --> 04:09.915
Tandy, you're right.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.049
I'm right?

04:11.051 --> 04:13.051
Come-come back.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.254
I've been...
I've been bullheaded.

04:15.256 --> 04:18.223
I think I've been letting
our past cloud my judgment.

04:18.225 --> 04:19.891
I got to pay my dues.

04:19.893 --> 04:22.427
Hey, I am so friggin'
proud of you right now.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.396
But, look, if you
really want to help me,

04:24.398 --> 04:26.265
(whispers): let me out of here
so I can find that bull.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.300
Think about how excited
everyone would be.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.569
I mean, that would be
a pretty baller move.

04:30.571 --> 04:31.536
Right!

04:31.538 --> 04:33.405
And, look, once I find it,

04:33.407 --> 04:36.275
I come right back,
put myself back in the stocks.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.210
I don't know. I mean...

04:38.212 --> 04:40.812
It's like you said,
we're family.

04:42.482 --> 04:44.116
MIKE:
<i>All right.</i>

04:44.118 --> 04:46.551
Just a few more
twisty-turnies here,

04:46.553 --> 04:51.390
and you and I will be
in the shortwave radio business.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.659
You don't think
it's gonna work, do you?

04:53.661 --> 04:55.460
Hey, look, this is
our best shot at connecting

04:55.462 --> 04:57.329
with another living person
out there, okay?

04:57.331 --> 04:59.331
It's better than
any of our other ideas,

04:59.333 --> 05:00.932
like, uh, the telescope

05:00.934 --> 05:03.969
or-or bouncing the laser pointer
off the Taj Mahal.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.171
Or your idea of just
flicking the lights off and on

05:06.173 --> 05:07.472
till someone notices.

05:08.675 --> 05:09.675
That-that was not my...

05:09.677 --> 05:11.510
Not my idea, mm-mm.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.477
No, nice try.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.980
Friggin' worm.

05:14.982 --> 05:15.981
Hello.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.349
(radio static hissing)

05:17.351 --> 05:19.484
This is Commander Mike Miller

05:19.486 --> 05:21.486
<i>from the International</i>
<i>Space Station.</i>

05:21.488 --> 05:22.988
<i>Anybody out there?</i>

05:32.932 --> 05:33.999
Hey, Gail, we're all...

05:34.001 --> 05:34.966
Oh! Oh!
Oh, God, I'm sorry!

05:34.968 --> 05:37.369
Uh...
I'm-I'm sorry.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.171
We're all gathering
in the kitchen.
I'm not...
No, I'm coming.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.340
I'm... I mean...
For-for... for the
whole... the bull thing.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.308
Yeah, no, the bull.
We're just in the kitchen.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.110
I just... a little
CPR refresher, okay?

05:45.112 --> 05:47.145
Yeah, right.
You take your time.
I'll be there in a second.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.146
C-Copy that. Yep.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.214
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

05:50.616 --> 05:52.117
Crap!

05:53.553 --> 05:55.721
Okay, in a moment,
we will be embarking

05:55.723 --> 05:58.390
on perhaps the most important
mission of our brave new world.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.959
Okay? Finding this bull

06:00.961 --> 06:03.895
is our "One giant leap
for mankind."

06:03.897 --> 06:07.499
Finding this bull
is our "I have a dream."

06:07.501 --> 06:09.067
Finding this bull

06:09.069 --> 06:11.470
is our "Where's the beef?"

06:11.472 --> 06:12.537
Literally.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.306
Can you get
to the point, Tandy?

06:14.308 --> 06:16.241
I can get to the point,
I can get to the set,

06:16.243 --> 06:17.843
I can get to the whole
freakin' match, Melissa.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.911
Let's let Phil
out of these stocks

06:19.913 --> 06:21.847
to help us search for this bull.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.482
Is that what this
is all about?

06:23.484 --> 06:25.050
This is about way
more than that.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.485
This is about team.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.819
Hey, team, take a knee.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.421
Yeah, I called us a team. Why?

06:29.423 --> 06:30.889
'Cause we are one.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.024
<i>Webster's Dictionary</i>
defines the word "team"

06:33.026 --> 06:36.261
as "Together Everyone
Achieves More."

06:36.263 --> 06:38.730
So let's let Phil
out of these stocks.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.233
'Cause at the end of the day,
there's no I in "team,"

06:41.235 --> 06:43.235
but there is one
in "find," okay?

06:43.237 --> 06:45.871
There's a T in Todd and Tandy;
there's an E in Erica;

06:45.873 --> 06:48.106
there's an A in Andrew,
Carol's middle name;

06:48.108 --> 06:50.742
and there is an M
in Melissa and Miller--

06:50.744 --> 06:52.010
my last name,
his last name, okay?

06:52.012 --> 06:53.245
There's no G for Gail.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.847
But that's because,
as the oldest...

06:55.849 --> 06:58.717
uh, non-youngest
member of our group,

06:58.719 --> 07:00.385
she's our coach.

07:00.387 --> 07:02.187
Every team needs
a grizzled coach,

07:02.189 --> 07:04.723
and there's a G in "grizzled"
and there's a G in Gail.

07:04.725 --> 07:08.894
So let's tear down these stocks,
Mr. Gorbachev.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.796
Okay?

07:10.798 --> 07:13.932
And let's go find
that mother-friggin' bull.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.567
If we say yes,
will you stop talking?

07:15.569 --> 07:16.635
Yes.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.603
Fine, do it.

07:18.605 --> 07:19.971
(whoops)

07:19.973 --> 07:21.306
TANDY:
Good news.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.208
They agreed to
let you out.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.643
I knew I could count on you.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.878
Oh, God, I'm so
excited about this.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.281
I never thought we'd be on
the same page with something.

07:29.283 --> 07:31.450
But, heck, here we are in
lockstep with each other.

07:31.452 --> 07:33.552
I won't even be surprised
if at some point

07:33.554 --> 07:36.087
we started finishing
each other's...

07:36.089 --> 07:39.057
(pitch rising)

07:39.059 --> 07:40.892
s... sentences.

07:40.894 --> 07:41.893
Yeah.
Mm.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.261
We'll get there one day.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.363
Or our names aren't...

07:48.301 --> 07:49.301
Phil Miller.
...Phil Miller.

07:49.303 --> 07:50.268
Yeah.
Yeah.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.137
(chuckles)

07:54.073 --> 07:55.907
(grunts)
Out you go.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.676
"Out, damned spot!"

07:57.678 --> 08:00.645
It's a Shakespeare...
reference.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.581
Where you going?

08:02.583 --> 08:04.583
Oh, look at you, real
man on a mission.

08:04.585 --> 08:05.951
Got that eye
of the tiger.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.152
Love it.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.820
So, uh, where you want
to start looking?

08:08.822 --> 08:10.655
I'll start with Canada.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.091
Canada? Oh, you're gonna start
there and work your way back?

08:13.093 --> 08:14.793
Bye, Tandy.

08:14.795 --> 08:17.662
Tell everyone they won't have
to worry about me anymore.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.364
'Cause I'm out of here.

08:19.366 --> 08:23.802
Wait, what about all the
stuff you said in the stocks?

08:23.804 --> 08:25.770
You're just
gonna leave us?

08:25.772 --> 08:27.772
We're your family.

08:30.476 --> 08:33.311
You know,
I don't have a family.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.313
Didn't you learn
anything from the virus?

08:35.315 --> 08:37.415
We're all alone.

08:39.318 --> 08:41.386
(engine starts)

08:44.524 --> 08:46.591
TANDY:
Oh, farts.

08:53.499 --> 08:54.966
TODD:
Hey, look. (chuckles)

08:54.968 --> 08:56.368
Hey, whoa, Todd...

08:56.370 --> 08:57.369
Wait, what?

08:57.371 --> 08:58.803
Uh, no, no. Oh, God.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.872
Uh, hey, I was gonna say,
"Hey, look, it's Gail."

09:00.874 --> 09:02.741
I'm sorry, I bet you thought
I was gonna say...

09:02.743 --> 09:04.409
Oh, yeah, I-I thought
you were gonna say,

09:04.411 --> 09:05.877
"Hey, look, there's
the bull."
No, I know.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.312
I-I was... I was...
I was gonna say,

09:07.314 --> 09:09.581
"Hey, uh... hey,
look, it's Gail."

09:09.583 --> 09:12.083
Probably should've just said,

09:12.085 --> 09:13.051
uh, hello.
Hi, or...

09:13.053 --> 09:14.219
Oh, yes, or hi.
Hello.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.587
Yes. Yeah.
You could have said hello.

09:15.589 --> 09:18.023
(clears throat)

09:18.025 --> 09:20.425
Boy, it's a hot one,
isn't it?
Did you see anything?

09:20.427 --> 09:21.927
Yeah.

09:21.929 --> 09:25.363
Okay, I'm just gonna come on
out and tell you what you saw.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.332
I took a CPR dummy,

09:27.334 --> 09:29.367
and I dressed it up
to look like Gordon,

09:29.369 --> 09:32.604
and I talk to it, and I
do other stuff with it,

09:32.606 --> 09:35.440
and we're probably gonna
need a new CPR dummy.

09:35.442 --> 09:38.276
Yep, that's what
I thought I saw.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.712
And I know it's nuts.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.114
But it just helps me.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.116
You know?

09:45.118 --> 09:47.519
'Cause I just miss
Gordon so dang much.

09:47.521 --> 09:50.021
I totally understand.

09:50.023 --> 09:53.024
You're so lucky
to have Melissa.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.093
Well, I don't know
if I do.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.928
It's been a bit
of a mess lately.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.130
We're just... I don't know.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.601
Well, hon, relationships
are always a roller coaster.

10:02.603 --> 10:05.437
You just... if you love her,
you just got to make it work.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.439
'Cause it is such a
blessing in this world

10:07.441 --> 10:10.408
if you have a partner,
someone you can talk to,

10:10.410 --> 10:12.277
someone who gets you.

10:12.279 --> 10:16.314
'Cause without that, life is
just a big bunch of nothing.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.450
(sighs)

10:22.655 --> 10:25.390
♪ ♪

10:34.266 --> 10:37.669
Carol, did you pack
unsweetened lemonade in here?

10:37.671 --> 10:39.170
Nope.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.573
That's what I thought,
yeah, yeah.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.043
CAROL:
Oh.

10:47.446 --> 10:50.248
Okay, you guys.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.750
Have some big news.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.853
First of all, this is not
unsweetened lemonade, okay?

10:54.855 --> 10:56.821
Uh, if we could just be

10:56.823 --> 10:59.357
a little more, uh,
conscious of labeling things.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.126
You know.

11:01.128 --> 11:04.496
Piece of tape, "urine."

11:04.498 --> 11:06.164
That's all I'm saying.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.699
Second of all--
and this is

11:07.701 --> 11:10.869
kind of the main thing-- um...

11:10.871 --> 11:14.539
Phil did not go out
searching for the bull.

11:14.541 --> 11:17.342
You know, I let him
out of the stocks,

11:17.344 --> 11:19.144
and he just drove off.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.646
ERICA:
So h-he's

11:21.648 --> 11:24.215
just, like,<i> gone</i> gone?

11:24.217 --> 11:26.451
D-Did he say anything?

11:26.453 --> 11:28.386
Yeah, he said
to tell all you guys

11:28.388 --> 11:30.822
that you don't have to worry
about him anymore.

11:30.824 --> 11:33.625
I mean, he said
it more like,

11:33.627 --> 11:35.660
(imitating Phil 2): "Tell them
they don't have to worry

11:35.662 --> 11:37.228
"about him,
I mean, me anymore...

11:37.230 --> 11:39.998
Tandy."

11:40.000 --> 11:42.500
So, uh, back on
the search again.

11:42.502 --> 11:43.501
(clears throat)

11:43.503 --> 11:45.003
Hey, hey!

11:45.005 --> 11:47.172
Look, we got supplies.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.473
We got maps.

11:48.475 --> 11:51.076
Uh, we got walkies
and, uh, unlabeled cow urine.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.311
You know, you know,
why don't we put a-a pin

11:53.313 --> 11:56.881
in this bull search
and, uh, and go find Phil, huh?

11:59.318 --> 12:02.053
So we're not even
gonna look for him?

12:02.055 --> 12:04.489
We're just gonna
let him be alone?

13:18.798 --> 13:21.666
Oh, it's the famous bull hunter.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.001
Any luck with
the bull?

13:23.003 --> 13:24.636
Obviously not.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.337
Don't you think
I would've told you?

13:26.339 --> 13:28.606
I don't know what you will
and won't tell me anymore.

13:28.608 --> 13:29.941
Okay, you know what?
That's it.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.743
We need to talk about this.

13:31.745 --> 13:34.179
Oh, fun! So after walking
around in the heat all day,

13:34.181 --> 13:36.581
you want to go
fry up some bacon

13:36.583 --> 13:38.249
and gab about our
relationship some more?

13:38.251 --> 13:40.618
What is going on here, Melissa?

13:40.620 --> 13:43.188
I mean, I'm obviously
not making you happy.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.290
And, you know, you're not...

13:45.292 --> 13:46.691
you know.

13:46.693 --> 13:47.826
What?

13:47.828 --> 13:49.160
Nothing. Let's just...

13:49.162 --> 13:50.261
Just say it.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.796
I'm not making you happy.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.865
No, I just...

13:55.801 --> 13:58.670
Uh...

13:58.672 --> 14:02.040
I don't know,
maybe it's just time...

14:02.042 --> 14:04.008
we take a little break.

14:04.010 --> 14:07.579
No, Todd, I think maybe
it's time we take a big break.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.653
(knocking)

14:15.655 --> 14:18.489
Come on in.

14:18.491 --> 14:19.657
Hey.

14:19.659 --> 14:21.359
Hey.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.228
I hope I'm not
disturbing you and Gordon.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.630
Oh, no, we're taking a breather.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.832
(crying):
Melissa and I just broke up.

14:27.834 --> 14:28.967
Oh.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.536
Todd.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.004
Hey.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.240
I'm so sorry.

14:35.242 --> 14:36.741
Aw.

14:38.143 --> 14:40.178
You look like a man
who could use a drink.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.080
That sounds great.
Okay.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.048
(sighs)

14:44.050 --> 14:45.750
You know, maybe it was

14:45.752 --> 14:47.652
for the best. I don't know.

14:47.654 --> 14:50.054
We were just...
We kept fighting all the time.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.991
And it was just...
getting really heavy.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.759
God, I know how that is.

14:54.761 --> 14:57.562
Do you remember how much
Gordon and I fought

14:57.564 --> 14:58.730
when we first met?

14:58.732 --> 15:00.265
It was like
cats and dogs.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.266
Yeah, I mean,

15:01.268 --> 15:02.400
I'll never forget that time

15:02.402 --> 15:04.402
he stood up on the table
and peed in your wine.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.670
You threw it in his eyes.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.538
Aw, yeah.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.275
(crying):
I miss her so much already.

15:10.277 --> 15:13.011
Oh... hey.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.178
Come in here.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.880
I'm sorry.

15:15.882 --> 15:18.783
Aw. You know what?

15:18.785 --> 15:20.785
You are gonna be okay.
Thanks, Gail.

15:20.787 --> 15:23.021
You really are.
I just wonder,
you know, if it is.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.689
It's gonna be all right.
Don't wonder, no.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.858
Because, you know, you just,
it's so seldom that you meet

15:26.860 --> 15:28.726
somebody that you really like.
You will. You're gonna
be all right.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.261
Nobody ever knows these
things, but I swear,

15:30.263 --> 15:32.864
it just takes time.
But I guess it just
all takes some time.

15:43.876 --> 15:44.909
(loud thump, all gasp)

15:44.911 --> 15:46.210
(clears throat)

15:46.212 --> 15:48.046
Good morning, Vietnam.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.547
You know, this morning
when I watched Phil

15:49.549 --> 15:51.616
drive out of here
and head for Canada,

15:51.618 --> 15:53.251
I thought he was crazy.

15:53.253 --> 15:56.054
I mean, why would anyone choose
to be alone, when they could

15:56.056 --> 15:57.822
live in a world
with people?

16:00.626 --> 16:02.226
That's what Phil chose to do.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.895
(loud thump)

16:03.897 --> 16:05.964
'Cause the way
we were treating him,

16:05.966 --> 16:08.800
that alternative seemed better
than sticking around here.

16:11.136 --> 16:13.905
Maybe you guys don't remember
what it felt like out there.

16:13.907 --> 16:15.807
(thump)
How lonely,

16:15.809 --> 16:18.343
how sad, how pointless life was.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.078
Well, I remember.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.412
(loud thump)

16:21.414 --> 16:23.815
'Cause I almost had
to go back to that.

16:23.817 --> 16:26.284
But somehow,
I got a second chance.

16:26.286 --> 16:27.352
(loud thump)

16:27.354 --> 16:29.854
Look, I deserve
everything I got, you know?

16:29.856 --> 16:31.189
And in a way,

16:31.191 --> 16:32.523
Phil does, too.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.926
Okay? He's not perfect.

16:34.928 --> 16:37.128
But who among us is?

16:37.130 --> 16:38.863
(loud thump)

16:38.865 --> 16:41.666
There's an old expression,
uh, that says,

16:41.668 --> 16:43.368
"Let he who is without sin

16:43.370 --> 16:46.371
cast the first stone
in a glass house."

16:46.373 --> 16:47.772
Okay, I don't need
another Tandy talk.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.108
Okay, Melissa, why don't
we start with you, then, huh?

16:50.110 --> 16:51.542
This is a woman

16:51.544 --> 16:54.946
who strongly and forcefully
tried to hit on a married man.

16:54.948 --> 16:56.180
That's me.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.683
I absolutely did not.
You did.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.152
You told me you were horny,
and that is a solid hit-on.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.287
And, look, Carol,
you are fully justified

17:03.289 --> 17:05.023
to throw that rock
at her horny little head,

17:05.025 --> 17:07.058
but here's
why you won't.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.693
'Cause you lied
to this entire group

17:08.695 --> 17:10.194
about me being dead.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.230
Why are you bringing that up?!

17:12.232 --> 17:13.531
Just proving the point

17:13.533 --> 17:15.700
that none of us
are without sin, okay?

17:15.702 --> 17:18.002
Bacon, teen pregnancy.

17:18.004 --> 17:19.737
I'm 25.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.906
Wait, you're judging Erica
for getting pregnant?

17:21.908 --> 17:23.508
No, the exact opposite!

17:23.510 --> 17:25.877
And I'm gonna
not-judge you next, okay?

17:25.879 --> 17:28.246
'Cause I know
what you did, Gail.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.714
And there are some people
at this table

17:29.716 --> 17:31.149
who are not gonna be
very happy with it.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.251

17:33.253 --> 17:34.652
barfed in the humidor.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.988
I did not.

17:36.990 --> 17:38.890
Gail, it was tortilla chips
and Chardonnay!

17:38.892 --> 17:41.893
I did not knowingly
barf in the humidor.

Well, I think maybe
you should start caring

17:50.904 --> 17:53.037
a little bit more
about a few things.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.839
What are you getting at, Gail?
Okay, you know what,
let's just...

17:54.841 --> 17:57.175
You know what?
What? What? Calm down?
Yes!

17:57.177 --> 17:58.242

18:04.684 --> 18:06.517
Guess what, Erica,
you're not special, okay?

18:06.519 --> 18:08.252
You're just pregnant!

18:08.254 --> 18:10.054
No, don't say "pregnant"
