Bobby Raskin?

36:01.619 --> 36:03.203
Ugh!
You're from Iowa.

36:03.238 --> 36:06.406
He's big.
He's like Tommy Mottola.

36:06.457 --> 36:08.909

"who's Tommy Mottola?"

the first day?

36:19.087 --> 36:21.255
Marilyn would have!

we're about to start.

Our esteemed lyricist
has finally finished the verses

37:00.845 --> 37:02.629

Since we're six days away
from an invited audience,

37:05.016 --> 37:06.450
I'd like to work quickly.

37:06.484 --> 37:08.185
So let's try it
with the original staging

37:08.219 --> 37:09.636
and see if it fits
the new words.

37:09.687 --> 37:11.772
Places for the second verse,
please.

37:11.806 --> 37:14.107
Uh, and if you guys
could try it without the pages,

37:14.142 --> 37:15.108
that would be super.

37:15.143 --> 37:17.110
- Uh...
- Just do it.

37:17.145 --> 37:18.228
No, no, no.
