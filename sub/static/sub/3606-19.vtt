00:00.301 --> 00:04.870
Kara: <i> When I was a child,</i>
<i> my planet Krypton was dying.</i>

00:04.872 --> 00:08.374
<i> I was sent to earth</i>
<i> to protect my cousin.</i>

00:08.376 --> 00:10.275
<i> But my pod got</i>
<i> knocked off-course</i>

00:10.277 --> 00:12.011
<i> and by the time I got here,</i>

00:12.013 --> 00:16.081
<i> my cousin</i>
<i> had already grown up</i>
<i> and become superman.</i>

00:16.083 --> 00:17.950
<i> And so I hid my powers</i>

00:17.952 --> 00:22.621
<i> until recently</i>
<i> when an accident forced me</i>
<i> to reveal myself to the world.</i>

00:22.623 --> 00:26.025
<i> To most people</i>
<i> I'm an assistant</i>
<i> at catco worldwide media.</i>

00:26.027 --> 00:29.661
<i> But in secret, I work with my</i>
<i> adoptive sister for the deo</i>

00:29.663 --> 00:31.663
<i> to protect my city</i>
<i> from alien life</i>

00:31.665 --> 00:34.033
<i> and anyone else</i>
<i> that means to cause it harm.</i>

00:35.669 --> 00:38.270
<i> I am Supergirl.</i>

00:38.272 --> 00:40.105
Kara:
<i> Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:40.107 --> 00:42.107
Alex: <i> Hank didn't kill astra.</i>

00:42.109 --> 00:43.375
(Softly) I did.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.377
Ma'am, colonel Harper
just resigned

00:45.379 --> 00:47.246
and named a new
acting director of the deo.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.448
-Who?
-You.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.784
I'm a fugitive now.
I'm on the run.

00:51.786 --> 00:55.721
By the way, I call myself
indigo these days.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.723
Myriad works.

00:57.725 --> 01:01.560
And, very soon, astra's dream
for what earth can become
will be reality.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.031
James?

01:06.033 --> 01:07.533
First national city,

01:07.535 --> 01:10.436
and then the earth
itself will belong to us.

01:24.552 --> 01:27.352
Deo is secure.
What are your orders?

01:27.354 --> 01:29.288
<i> -Release the prisoners.</i>
-It is done.

01:29.290 --> 01:32.491
<i> All but the white martian.</i>

01:32.493 --> 01:34.793
<i> For everyone's sake,</i>
<i> leave that one be.</i>

01:38.866 --> 01:41.834
Computer: <i> Warning.</i>
<i> Containment override</i>
<i> activated.</i>

01:41.836 --> 01:44.103
<i> Cell power dampeners</i>
<i> will shut down</i>

01:44.105 --> 01:45.604
<i> in two minutes.</i>

01:45.606 --> 01:46.839
(Alarm blares)

01:58.786 --> 02:00.352
I know not your face, human.

02:01.622 --> 02:05.057
I am maxima,
queen of the planet almerac.

02:05.059 --> 02:08.560
Open this door
and you'll find out
exactly what that means.

02:17.404 --> 02:18.637
(Grunts)

02:19.974 --> 02:21.607
(Grunting)

02:23.577 --> 02:26.812
Do you value
your life so little
you won't fight back?

02:26.814 --> 02:29.114
Myriad has begun on earth.

02:29.116 --> 02:31.950
Non calls you to his legions.

02:31.952 --> 02:34.419
You will be the kings
and queens of this world,

02:34.421 --> 02:37.890
once you swear
your fidelity to him.

02:37.892 --> 02:41.293
Since superman refused
the honor of marrying me...

02:41.295 --> 02:45.297
Computer: <i> Warning.</i>
<i> Prisoner release</i>
<i> in one minute.</i>

02:45.299 --> 02:48.400
I will pledge allegiance
to your non.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.649
Early parole is canceled.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.751
(Both grunting)

03:23.671 --> 03:24.836
That tickled.

03:27.274 --> 03:30.242
We could have been family,
Kara Zor-El.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.244
I once sought to make
your cousin my mate.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.545
Ew, gross!

03:37.618 --> 03:38.684
(Loud grunt)

03:42.656 --> 03:44.156
(Gun firing)

03:44.158 --> 03:45.457
(Groans)

03:45.459 --> 03:47.559
(Gunfire continues)

03:50.965 --> 03:52.030
(Gun clicking)

03:52.032 --> 03:54.266
Lucy! You have to fight it.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.301
You have to wake up!

03:56.303 --> 03:57.769
-Computer: <i> Warning.</i>
-(Cocks gun)

03:57.771 --> 04:00.405
<i> Prisoner release</i>
<i> in 15 seconds.</i>

04:04.111 --> 04:05.510
(Grunts)

04:07.047 --> 04:08.447
(Guns click)

04:09.250 --> 04:10.949
(Panting)

04:12.886 --> 04:14.086
(Beeping)

04:14.088 --> 04:18.457
<i> Warning. Prisoner release</i>
<i> in five, four,</i>

04:19.126 --> 04:21.026
<i> three, two...</i>

04:22.663 --> 04:24.229
(Panting)

04:24.231 --> 04:27.332
<i> Containment override</i>
<i> deactivated.</i>

04:27.334 --> 04:30.402
<i> Prisoner cell release</i>
<i> canceled.</i>

04:30.904 --> 04:32.337
(Groaning)

04:34.141 --> 04:35.807
(Grunting)

04:37.211 --> 04:38.710
(Clatters)

04:39.346 --> 04:41.046
(Panting)

04:41.048 --> 04:42.414
Lucy...

04:43.884 --> 04:44.950
I'm so sorry.

04:47.254 --> 04:48.520
(Gasps)

05:01.135 --> 05:02.634
Kelex?

05:04.004 --> 05:06.371
Kelex, are you here?

05:06.373 --> 05:08.006
<i> How may I assist you,</i>
<i> lady Kara?</i>

05:08.008 --> 05:10.175
Where is Kal-El?
I can't find him
anywhere on earth.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.878
<i> Kal-El is attending to</i>
<i> a matter off-world.</i>

05:14.114 --> 05:17.683
Kelex, I need you to tell me
about myriad.

05:17.685 --> 05:21.320
<i> Warning. This construct</i>
<i> is not authorized</i>
<i> to discuss myriad.</i>

05:21.322 --> 05:24.756
You were designed to obey
the members of
the honorable house of El,

05:24.758 --> 05:27.826
and to preserve the memory
of Krypton wherever it went.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.796
If you don't override
your orders,

05:30.798 --> 05:33.498
myriad will destroy
the house of El

05:33.500 --> 05:37.369
and the memory of Krypton
will be lost forever.

05:37.371 --> 05:40.072
You will have failed
in your prime directive.

05:41.608 --> 05:42.674
Please.

05:43.811 --> 05:47.479
Please! I just need someone
to help me!

05:48.482 --> 05:50.115
Hello, Kara.

05:51.085 --> 05:52.351
Mom!

05:52.353 --> 05:55.253
Myriad was developed
on Krypton by your aunt.

05:55.255 --> 05:58.857
It was created to prevent
the planet's
imminent destruction.

05:58.859 --> 06:02.594
We had strangled the planet's
resources beyond recovery.

06:02.596 --> 06:06.598
The politicians argued,
but could not agree
on what to do.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.534
Thus, according to
high records,

06:09.536 --> 06:12.104
astra implemented
her own solution.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.172
Myriad.

06:14.174 --> 06:18.377
Technology designed
to force everyone
to her way of thinking.

06:19.246 --> 06:20.579
Mind control.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.614
When they were caught
attempting to use

06:22.616 --> 06:26.051
the myriad technology against
the people of argo city,

06:26.053 --> 06:27.719
astra and non were arrested.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.721
And sentenced to fort rozz.

06:29.723 --> 06:33.592
Much like Krypton, this planet
is on the verge of
ecological destruction.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.660
I can stop it.

06:35.662 --> 06:37.562
But the humans won't like
my methods.

06:37.564 --> 06:40.098
That's why I need you.
They trust you.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.666
Together we can save them.

06:41.668 --> 06:45.604
That's what they've been
trying to do all along.

06:45.606 --> 06:48.407
They've been trying to use
myriad on earth.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.742
To save the planet.

06:52.546 --> 06:56.014
But I don't understand.
Why is everyone so afraid
to talk about it?

06:56.016 --> 06:57.949
Why wouldn't you
even speak of it?

06:57.951 --> 07:02.721
Myriad could be used to
enslave whole worlds
at the push of a button.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.389
The high council determined

07:04.391 --> 07:07.292
that if knowledge
of such technology
were to get out,

07:07.294 --> 07:10.862
it would upset
the delicate balance
of power of the galaxy.

07:10.864 --> 07:11.963
Mom, please.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.366
You have to tell me
how to stop this.

07:14.368 --> 07:16.902
I am sorry, my dear Kara.

07:16.904 --> 07:20.138
Once started,
myriad cannot be stopped.

07:38.325 --> 07:39.591
Remain seated.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.660
We're on the lookout
for a pair of fugitives,

07:41.662 --> 07:44.796
wanted in connection to
some very serious crimes.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.933
These two are considered
to be extremely dangerous.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.769
If you have any information,
please speak up.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.206
(Indistinct murmurs)

08:11.525 --> 08:13.859
This bus is clear.
Let's get out of here.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.109
(Keyboards clacking)

08:37.184 --> 08:38.583
Supergirl: Kelly?

08:38.585 --> 08:40.185
(Continues typing)

08:40.787 --> 08:42.787
That's Kryptonian.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.690
What is non up to?

08:53.133 --> 08:55.700
Winn. Winn?

08:56.670 --> 08:58.637
Winn, can you hear me?

08:59.506 --> 09:01.106
I know you're in there.

09:02.676 --> 09:05.176
I could really use
my friend right now.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.078
(Continues typing)

09:11.018 --> 09:12.317
James.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.120
Come on, James.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.858
You are stronger than this.
Come back.

09:20.627 --> 09:22.294
Come back to me.

09:24.264 --> 09:27.098
There was a time
that I was so afraid
you wouldn't see me

09:27.100 --> 09:29.200
and now I just wish
you'd smile.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.870
<i> The United States army</i>
<i> has taken up position</i>

09:31.872 --> 09:34.806
<i> at every entrance way</i>
<i> into national city.</i>

09:34.808 --> 09:36.975
<i> Until this threat</i>
<i> is neutralized,</i>

09:36.977 --> 09:40.312
<i> national city has effectively</i>
<i> been quarantined.</i>

09:40.314 --> 09:42.681
-This is general Lane.
<i> -It's Supergirl.</i>

09:42.683 --> 09:45.016
-How's Lucy.
-She's alive.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.351
<i> She's safe.</i>

09:46.353 --> 09:49.354
She's enthralled to non's
master weapon, isn't she?

09:50.257 --> 09:52.991
(Sighs) Yes.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.694
Listen, you need to keep
everybody outside
of city limits

09:55.696 --> 09:57.996
until I can
figure this out, okay?

09:59.232 --> 10:02.233
I know you and i
haven't always had

10:02.235 --> 10:04.169
the best work relationship,
but...

10:04.171 --> 10:07.806
I'll do my part.
I trust you'll do yours.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.808
Good luck.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.746
(Elevator bell dings)

10:14.748 --> 10:19.117
Ker-rah, call Harrison Ford
and tell him that
I'm flattered,

10:19.119 --> 10:21.686
but once and for all,
i do not date older men,

10:21.688 --> 10:23.688
especially when
they're married.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.223
(Supergirl clears throat)

10:25.892 --> 10:26.992
Oh!

10:27.561 --> 10:28.727
Supergirl!

10:28.729 --> 10:29.961
Well, what a
pleasant surprise.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.596
What, do we have a 9:00 A.M.?

10:31.598 --> 10:33.431
-You're not a mindless drone.
-Uh, no.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.467
No, I learned that lesson
when Demi Moore and I

10:35.469 --> 10:38.403
wore the same dress
to the premiere of <i> ghosts.</i>
Never again.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.105
Ms. Grant, listen to me.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.607
Everyone in the city
is affected by this
alien signal.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.242
They're acting
like automatons.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.112
Haven't you noticed?

10:47.114 --> 10:50.582
Hmm, well, yes,
they are a bit more quiet
than usual.

10:50.584 --> 10:53.952
Maybe my reign of terror
has finally reached
its peaked effectiveness.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.654
-(Cell phone chimes)
-Oh.

10:55.656 --> 10:58.690
Ah, you do have a cell phone?
Can I get that number, please?

10:58.692 --> 11:01.860
-It's superman.
-Oh, can I get his number
as well?

11:01.862 --> 11:03.595
He's coming to help.

11:03.597 --> 11:04.996
He is?

11:07.668 --> 11:09.267
Where is he?

11:15.709 --> 11:18.276
(Distant footsteps)

11:18.278 --> 11:19.644
Cat: Oh, my god.

11:19.646 --> 11:22.747
What's happening to everyone?

11:22.749 --> 11:24.249
There he is!
There he is.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.751
Who? Superman? Where?

11:27.154 --> 11:28.219
What?

11:29.890 --> 11:31.523
What? Oh, god. No.

11:31.525 --> 11:32.791
What is it?

11:32.793 --> 11:34.726
Myriad. It's affecting
my cousin too.

11:34.728 --> 11:37.362
Myriad?

11:37.364 --> 11:39.764
Wait a minute,
if it's affecting superman,

11:39.766 --> 11:42.033
then are any of us safe?

11:42.035 --> 11:44.869
Well, I may not be superman,
but...

11:45.539 --> 11:47.105
I do have my moments.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.283
Do Kryptonians gloat?

11:58.285 --> 11:59.918
Because I'll bet
wherever he is,

11:59.920 --> 12:01.886
ol' uncle non
is feeling pretty good
about himself.

12:01.888 --> 12:04.389
Why am I not surprised
that your brain
is intact, Max?

12:04.391 --> 12:08.193
What is it they say?
Only cockroaches
will survive the apocalypse.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.694
Happy to see you too, cat.

12:09.696 --> 12:11.696
You look lovely,
considering the end is nigh.

12:11.698 --> 12:14.899
-Why weren't you affected?
-Ion blockers.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.969
I realized the Kryptonians
were using my lte
interface system.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.905
That's why they broke
into my lab over Christmas.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.074
They're using my satellites
to send neural signals

12:23.076 --> 12:25.844
directly into the minds of
everyone in national city.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.379
These scramble the signal
before they reach my brain.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.682
If you invented technology
that blocks myriad,

12:30.684 --> 12:32.884
why didn't you give it
to the deo?

12:32.886 --> 12:35.520
Once henshaw
and his trusted girl Friday
stepped down,

12:35.522 --> 12:37.088
I had no one
at the deo to trust.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.858
Well, clearly, not everybody
needs this ear-wig thingy,

12:39.860 --> 12:43.461
because I don't have one
and my brain
is perfectly intact.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.463
I see you got the earrings
i sent you last night.

12:45.465 --> 12:46.731
(Clicks tongue) Oh, I get it.

12:46.733 --> 12:49.400
-Ion blockers
in the diamonds?
-Mmm-hmm.

12:49.402 --> 12:52.103
Oh, so many karats
and yet so functional.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.938
(Chuckles) Didn't seem right

12:53.940 --> 12:56.808
for the world to lose
cat Grant's mind.

12:59.412 --> 13:02.080
Speaking of, where is
your faithful assistant?

13:02.082 --> 13:03.414
Out marching with the masses?

13:03.416 --> 13:05.483
(Sighs) Don't be glib, Max.

13:05.485 --> 13:08.887
Probably should be worried
about her.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.990
If it only targets humans,
why was my cousin affected?

13:11.992 --> 13:13.825
Nature versus nurture.

13:13.827 --> 13:16.661
He may be an alien,
but your cousin grew up
on earth.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.229
Seems like
environmental factors,

13:18.231 --> 13:21.966
being raised by ordinary
people, made his brain
more human.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.068
The man of steel
brought to his knees

13:24.070 --> 13:26.905
all because he went to
kindergarten and watched
<i> sesame street.</i>

13:26.907 --> 13:28.673
You think this is funny?

13:28.675 --> 13:32.744
Everything I have feared
has come to pass.
I couldn't be more serious.

13:32.746 --> 13:35.680
We have to stop them.
They're using your satellites.

13:35.682 --> 13:39.150
Can't you reprogram them
and destroy myriad
from the inside?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.219
I tried.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.121
There's some pretty epic
force fields around those
satellites at the moment.

13:43.123 --> 13:46.257
You're always 10 steps ahead,
Max. I know you have a plan.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.326
Of course I do.
(Clicks tongue)

13:49.529 --> 13:50.862
We kill them all.

13:58.205 --> 14:02.574
When Alexander saw
the breadth of
his domain, he wept,

14:02.576 --> 14:05.443
for there were no more
worlds to conquer.

14:06.880 --> 14:07.946
Need a tissue?

14:09.082 --> 14:12.517
National city
under our control, at last.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.320
Even Kal-El could not escape
its power.

14:15.322 --> 14:18.389
Nothing can stand
against us now.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.926
Except your niece.

14:21.928 --> 14:25.530
I calculate she's
chomping at the bit
to take her revenge on you.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.700
Like astra, you overestimate
her strength.

14:31.504 --> 14:37.809
Since your dearly-departed
wife's corpse is floating
through space right now,

14:37.811 --> 14:41.112
I'd say maybe you both
underestimated her power.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.081
You want me to kill her?

14:43.083 --> 14:46.384
Every minute that she lives
is a minute that
she's plotting against us.

14:46.386 --> 14:50.722
She has already prevented
the release of the fort rozz
escapees from the deo.

14:50.724 --> 14:53.224
It will not change
the outcome.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.160
Kill Kara Zor-El today

14:56.162 --> 14:58.129
or fight her tomorrow.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.133
And once it's done,

15:02.135 --> 15:04.936
you can go back to admiring
your kingdom.

15:16.516 --> 15:17.782
(Door squeaks)

15:23.657 --> 15:25.123
-Who are you?
-Alex: Mom!

15:25.125 --> 15:26.557
No, no, it's me.
It's Alex.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.860
Alex! Oh, my god!

15:28.862 --> 15:31.763
-Hi.
-Hi. I needed that.

15:31.765 --> 15:34.332
Are you all right?
What is going on?

15:34.334 --> 15:35.400
Well...

15:35.402 --> 15:37.969
And who's this?

15:37.971 --> 15:41.005
Oh, uh, yes, that's
a little harder to explain.

15:41.007 --> 15:43.474
-I don't understand, sweetie.
-I...

15:43.476 --> 15:46.711
Dr. danvers, you might want
to step back.

15:49.983 --> 15:52.050
(Rustling)

15:52.052 --> 15:54.585
-What the hell?
-No, no, no. It's okay.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.788
No, whatever that is,
that killed your father!

15:56.790 --> 15:58.556
-No, he didn't.
-What?

15:58.558 --> 16:01.793
The real Hank henshaw
blackmailed dad into
joining the deo.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.262
This is who tried to save him.

16:04.264 --> 16:07.598
His name is j'onn.
He's a shape-shifter
from Mars.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.502
Is it true?

16:11.504 --> 16:13.604
What's true is your husband
was one of the best people
I've ever known.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.273
He saved my life.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.809
Alex: And j'onn has saved mine
and Kara's. You can trust him.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.811
Mom, we don't have much time.

16:19.813 --> 16:22.246
J'onn and I are on the run.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.283
We just stopped by
to supply up.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.919
Wait. "On the run"?
How did you even
get out of the city?

16:27.921 --> 16:29.520
What are you talking about?

16:29.522 --> 16:32.156
You don't know
what's happening
in national city?

16:32.158 --> 16:34.158
There's something
you have to see.

16:38.498 --> 16:43.101
(Scoffs) Max, how exactly
do you plan on killing
an army of supermans?

16:43.103 --> 16:45.703
I'll tell you the plan when
i know you're both on board.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.638
Can't have muscles over here
trying to stop me.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.607
Killing is never the solution.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.209
Except we're way past
villains-of-the-week
and kittens stuck in trees.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.177
We're at war.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.912
And the only way to win a war
is to kill the enemy
before they kill us.

16:54.914 --> 16:56.647
So, time to grow up and put on
the big girl cape.

16:56.649 --> 16:59.150
Oh, looks like someone made it
through security.

17:01.154 --> 17:04.122
The son of Jor-El
has already knelt before me.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.657
Soon you will too.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.933
I don't want
to fight you, child.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.301
Afraid I'll win?

17:17.303 --> 17:19.037
You've already lost.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.272
Accept it
and the glorious fulfillment
of astra's vision.

17:21.274 --> 17:22.840
In the end, she defeated you.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.876
This doesn't look like
victory to me.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.078
And all you're doing
is betraying her.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.847
I was with astra
in her final moments.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.618
We forgave each other,

17:33.620 --> 17:37.021
we paid respect
to our blood bonds.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.857
-She didn't want this.
-Of course she did.

17:39.859 --> 17:43.127
It's what everyone wants,
is it not?

17:43.129 --> 17:44.962
Peace on earth.
Goodwill towards man.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.631
It's a lot less like
Christmas out there

17:46.633 --> 17:48.266
and more like
<i> dawn of the dead.</i>

17:48.268 --> 17:51.769
The human race finally
has a chance to live.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.305
Or it would suffer
the same fate as Krypton.

17:54.307 --> 17:56.474
And the same thing
is happening on earth,

17:56.476 --> 18:01.179
with a populace more
interested in reality stars
and political circuses

18:01.181 --> 18:04.115
than working together
to solve the world's problems.

18:04.117 --> 18:07.018
So, mind control is the answer
to global warming?

18:07.020 --> 18:08.586
(Clicks tongue)
Why didn't I think of that?

18:08.588 --> 18:11.656
Thanks to myriad, there are
no more racial divisions,

18:11.658 --> 18:14.492
no Republicans, no democrats.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.928
Only one people,
working with one purpose

18:16.930 --> 18:20.498
towards one goal.
To save the world.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.434
Except you haven't saved them,
you've enslaved them.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.603
Humanity is better than this.

18:25.605 --> 18:29.874
If you really want this planet
to avoid the fate of Krypton,
then work with us.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.142
Non: With these people?

18:31.144 --> 18:33.411
These two are the best of
your world

18:33.413 --> 18:38.416
and all they do is help
the populace amuse
themselves to death.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.885
If anything, they laid
the groundwork for me.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.420
You've already turned us
into drones.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.322
Winn! Winn, can you hear me?

18:44.324 --> 18:47.291
Your inventions have
drowned out sense
and turned it into nonsense.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.227
Winn: But now
everyone is united,

18:49.229 --> 18:51.229
everyone's creativity
and thought

18:51.231 --> 18:55.967
dedicated to
eradicating famine,
disease, climate change.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.602
Maxwell: You're harvesting
the brain power

18:57.604 --> 19:01.439
of everyone in the city
to solve the world's problems?

19:01.441 --> 19:03.241
National city is a giant
think tank?

19:03.243 --> 19:07.211
This is not the way to solve
the world's problems.

19:07.213 --> 19:09.847
Your heroics have done nothing
to save the planet.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.816
This is the inevitability
of myriad.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.017
Non, stop this!

19:13.019 --> 19:14.785
These are your friends,
aren't they?

19:14.787 --> 19:16.387
Let them go.

19:16.389 --> 19:17.922
I've have lived with loss.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.159
Allow me to return the favor.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.364
Cat: Kelly?

19:27.100 --> 19:28.900
What are you doing to them?

19:28.902 --> 19:32.336
Non has ended crime
in national city in one day.
One second.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.971
Supergirl: Winn. Winn, stop!

19:33.973 --> 19:35.740
Which is more than
the three of you
have ever done.

19:35.742 --> 19:38.042
James. James?

19:38.044 --> 19:39.277
-Kelly.
-Oh, my god.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.245
-No, no, no, no, no, no!
-What's happening?

19:43.816 --> 19:45.750
-What's happening?
-Catch.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.388
No!

20:04.604 --> 20:07.772
Oh, my god.
Oh, my...

20:07.774 --> 20:09.807
-You missed one.
-(Grunts)

20:09.809 --> 20:13.010
-Do not stand against me.
-Or more will die.

20:13.012 --> 20:17.848
Everyone you know,
love, and care for will die.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.819
Accept defeat, Kara Zor-El.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.955
I have already saved
national city.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.991
Next, I will save the world.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.467
(Breath trembling)

20:48.414 --> 20:50.948
It's a nice photograph.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.483
Beautiful family.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.052
We were.

20:59.225 --> 21:03.227
So, Alex said Jeremiah
saved your life.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.365
Were you with him?

21:09.235 --> 21:11.269
Were you with him at the end?

21:12.538 --> 21:15.206
His only thought was for you
and the girls.

21:16.409 --> 21:17.775
I made him a promise.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.478
And I've been trying to
keep that promise
every day since.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.114
Thank you.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.919
So, Mars...

21:28.921 --> 21:33.491
I have to ask,
underneath it all,
are you a little green man?

21:34.694 --> 21:36.994
I'm a big green man, actually.

21:36.996 --> 21:40.398
Ha! And how are you able
to change form?

21:40.400 --> 21:43.668
Is it an enzyme or some other
chemical catalyst

21:43.670 --> 21:47.204
your body secretes that allows
you to reorganize your DNA?

21:47.206 --> 21:49.774
And how do you adjust
for the change
in body density?

21:49.776 --> 21:51.676
How does your
respiratory system

21:51.678 --> 21:55.479
process the increased oxygen
and nitrogen present
in our air that...

21:55.481 --> 21:57.715
What? What is so funny?

21:57.717 --> 21:59.483
Like mother, like daughter.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.686
Kara? Are you all right?

22:01.688 --> 22:03.554
(Breath trembling) I'm fine.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.156
(Sighs) <i> You're lying.</i>

22:05.658 --> 22:07.358
Yes.

22:07.360 --> 22:10.061
Did you reach cadmus?
Did you and Hank find
your dad?

22:10.063 --> 22:12.430
We were on our way there
until we heard about all this.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.632
-Where are you now?
-At mom's.

22:14.634 --> 22:17.768
Stay there.
If you come to national city,
myriad will take over you too.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.937
There's no way
I'm leaving you there
by yourself.

22:19.939 --> 22:23.507
I'm not alone. I'm, uh...
I'm with Ms. Grant.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.076
Why wasn't cat affected?

22:26.045 --> 22:27.845
Maxwell lord protected her

22:28.514 --> 22:30.314
<i> and himself.</i>

22:30.316 --> 22:33.584
Of course he did.
Kara, we never know
when we can trust him.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.319
You know what?

22:35.321 --> 22:37.988
I don't really have a choice
right now.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.924
<i> You don't know what</i>
<i> it's like here.</i>

22:39.926 --> 22:41.926
It's my only option.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.696
-I love you, Alex.
<i> -Kara, listen...</i>

22:45.698 --> 22:47.331
(Phone beeps)

22:47.333 --> 22:48.466
Kara?

22:49.802 --> 22:51.068
(Sighs)

22:52.205 --> 22:54.472
She's working with Max
to stop non.

22:54.474 --> 22:56.741
-I'm going back.
-I don't think you can.

22:56.743 --> 22:58.776
I'm not human.
Myriad won't affect me.

22:58.778 --> 23:00.711
I'm going with you.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.913
No, you're not.
You're staying here where
this evil can't touch you.

23:02.915 --> 23:04.982
It's what your sister wants.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.084
It's what your father
would want.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.589
He still needs you.

23:15.628 --> 23:18.963
Maxwell: Are you finally ready
to do what needs to be done?

23:23.669 --> 23:25.236
(Sighs)

23:26.572 --> 23:28.205
What's your plan?

23:28.207 --> 23:31.709
Before you and I sang <i> Kumbaya</i>
and decided to be friends,

23:31.711 --> 23:34.945
I was working on a weapon
to use against
the Kryptonians.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.881
-All Kryptonians.
-What kind of weapon?

23:36.883 --> 23:39.116
A bomb.
Filled with kryptonite dust.

23:39.118 --> 23:42.219
It'll irradiate
the entire city.
Choke them all.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.889
No more myriad.

23:44.891 --> 23:49.460
Um, Anderson, do you think
you could hold on
for just a skosh?

23:49.462 --> 23:54.665
(Stammers) Forgive me,
but won't that kill
Supergirl and superman?

23:54.667 --> 23:58.135
Not if she flies up
and detonates it over
the city center.

23:58.137 --> 24:00.104
Then she and he skedaddle.

24:00.106 --> 24:03.073
She won't be able to come back
to national city for roughly
50 years...

24:03.075 --> 24:05.943
-(Laughs)
-But that's a small price to
pay to save the world, right?

24:05.945 --> 24:10.681
What about the human beings?
Will they be affected at all?

24:10.683 --> 24:13.717
The concussive force to
properly displace
the kryptonite dust

24:13.719 --> 24:15.419
will result in some losses.

24:15.421 --> 24:17.788
Hmm, Anderson, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

24:17.790 --> 24:21.292
What exactly are we
talking about, Max? Losses.

24:22.662 --> 24:23.794
8% of the population.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.830
8% of the population.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.198
8% of four million people?

24:27.200 --> 24:29.066
That is over
300,000 people, Max.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.035
Versus the seven billion
people on the planet

24:31.037 --> 24:32.303
that non wants to turn
into zombies.

24:32.305 --> 24:34.438
Are you seriously
considering this?

24:36.742 --> 24:38.309
She is.

24:38.311 --> 24:40.377
Because she knows
it's our only chance.

24:40.379 --> 24:41.912
If this spreads from
national city,

24:41.914 --> 24:43.514
it won't be long before
every man, woman and child,

24:43.516 --> 24:46.617
including your children,
will be on their knees.

24:46.619 --> 24:48.285
I won't let that happen.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.654
I swore to save this world.
That's exactly
what I'm going to do.

24:50.656 --> 24:53.123
What if we tell non
we have this weapon?

24:53.125 --> 24:54.592
Force him to see reason.

24:54.594 --> 24:57.795
(Scoffs) Tell that to Kelly,
the office skydiver.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.129
Please, have you no shame?

24:59.131 --> 25:01.332
No. Not anymore.
All I have is my mind.

25:01.334 --> 25:03.968
And for how much longer
I'm not sure.

25:03.970 --> 25:08.539
What I know is that,
for every second we don't act,
we risk the end of humanity.

25:10.409 --> 25:12.476
Time to save
the world, Supergirl.

25:13.779 --> 25:15.479
Are you with me?

25:22.388 --> 25:23.954
Did you get an answer?

25:23.956 --> 25:25.789
<i> I've spoken with</i>
<i> the president directly.</i>

25:25.791 --> 25:28.826
<i> She agrees</i>
<i> with your assessment.</i>

25:28.828 --> 25:32.162
<i> You have her authorization</i>
<i> to proceed with your plan.</i>

25:32.164 --> 25:33.430
Thank you, general.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.065
<i> May god have mercy</i>
<i> on our souls.</i>

25:35.067 --> 25:38.102
If there was a god, general,

25:38.104 --> 25:41.338
I'm sure she wouldn't have
put us in this mess
in the first place.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.640
(Beeps)

25:44.343 --> 25:46.443
How did you become like this?

25:50.983 --> 25:53.717
Did I ever tell you how
my parents died?

25:53.719 --> 25:56.120
Alex told me they were exposed
to a fatal virus

25:56.122 --> 25:58.756
when the government gave
them faulty Hazmat suits.

25:58.758 --> 26:01.125
What I didn't tell
your dear old sis

26:02.428 --> 26:04.895
was that I warned them
about those suits.

26:06.532 --> 26:08.766
I knew they wouldn't hold up.

26:08.768 --> 26:11.669
I begged them and the CDC
to scrap them, but...

26:11.671 --> 26:14.471
(Scoffs) No one would
listen to me.

26:16.108 --> 26:17.741
The know-it-all.

26:19.779 --> 26:22.546
I swore from that moment on,

26:24.150 --> 26:27.418
that if I could
protect people,
if I could save them,

26:27.420 --> 26:29.553
I wouldn't wait
for permission.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.222
I would act.

26:32.224 --> 26:35.159
Just like you do every time
you jump out the window
and save the day.

26:35.161 --> 26:37.561
We act, you and I.

26:40.232 --> 26:42.933
We're more alike
than you think.

26:43.603 --> 26:45.102
I hope not.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.641
I'll be at my facility
getting the bomb ready.

26:56.515 --> 26:57.848
Is the deed done?

26:57.850 --> 27:01.218
Kara Zor-El will no longer
be a problem.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.988
Is she dead or isn't she?

27:03.990 --> 27:06.190
I could have killed her.

27:06.192 --> 27:09.493
But that would have spared her
the agony of losing
everyone she loves.

27:09.495 --> 27:11.562
I thought it would please you.

27:13.933 --> 27:16.533
You've always known
how to please me.

27:18.638 --> 27:21.705
Now, it's time for us
to consider what's next.

27:21.707 --> 27:23.941
Next, we go to Metropolis.

27:23.943 --> 27:27.044
Then to opal city,
central city,

27:28.014 --> 27:29.947
Washington D.C.

27:29.949 --> 27:33.951
You sound like a cut-rate
politician running for office.

27:35.988 --> 27:39.123
The small dreams
of a small man.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.426
Not worthy of you.

27:42.428 --> 27:43.961
Already, the humans
in this city

27:43.963 --> 27:45.729
have cast away
their differences

27:45.731 --> 27:48.132
and are working towards
the salvation of their planet.

27:48.134 --> 27:52.770
For a lesser species,
they are surprisingly
creative.

27:52.772 --> 27:55.239
They show
exceptional ingenuity.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.074
All the better to serve you.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.544
And yet, you falter.

28:00.546 --> 28:04.915
I am the lord of earth.

28:04.917 --> 28:08.185
You could be
the lord of the universe.

28:09.155 --> 28:12.389
Don't you realize
what you have?

28:12.391 --> 28:16.894
You've created a force
that could take over
the galaxy.

28:16.896 --> 28:20.030
A vast army that exists
only to do your bidding.

28:21.934 --> 28:26.103
You want to take one planet
and turn it into your fiefdom,

28:26.105 --> 28:28.405
when you have
an entire universe

28:28.407 --> 28:31.041
crying out
to be ruled by you.

28:33.145 --> 28:36.180
To worship you as I do.

28:39.785 --> 28:41.218
Eliza: Alex said you were both
on the run.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.987
Are you in some kind of
trouble with the deo?

28:45.958 --> 28:47.858
Alex, we've been through this.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.427
If you expect me to just watch
you fly away,

28:50.429 --> 28:52.029
you're out of your mind.

28:53.032 --> 28:55.032
This is not up for discussion.

28:55.034 --> 28:58.869
Alex, I know
how brave you are,
but you cannot fight this.

28:59.705 --> 29:01.772
Yes. Yes, we can.

29:03.909 --> 29:07.611
I remember the last time
i watched my father
walk out that door.

29:07.613 --> 29:09.580
It was the worst day
of my life.

29:09.582 --> 29:13.717
Not finding out whether or not
he was coming back,
but watching him go.

29:13.719 --> 29:17.755
Knowing that whatever
happened next, I had no say.
That is not me.

29:17.757 --> 29:18.889
There's nothing you can do.

29:18.891 --> 29:21.225
Yes, there is.
If you help me.

29:21.227 --> 29:25.696
You can protect me.
You can use your telepathy
to guard my mind.

29:31.137 --> 29:32.336
All right.

29:39.812 --> 29:41.311
Promise you'll come home.

29:42.715 --> 29:46.049
I promise. I will try.

29:46.051 --> 29:47.684
Very, very hard.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.555
Mom, there's something
that you should know
about dad...

29:51.557 --> 29:53.757
Alex, we should go.

29:53.759 --> 29:55.225
What is it?

29:57.696 --> 29:59.163
I'll tell you
when we get back.

30:09.241 --> 30:11.375
(Distorted)
We'll see you soon, doctor.

30:19.185 --> 30:20.250
(Whooshing)

30:22.421 --> 30:26.557
(Sighs) I've always liked
the view out this window.

30:26.559 --> 30:29.359
Wish I had it
from my office.

30:29.361 --> 30:31.328
I like looking at the park.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.163
All the people.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.432
Mothers pushing
their strollers.

30:35.434 --> 30:37.534
Kids playing.

30:37.536 --> 30:41.438
I wonder which of them
will die in Max's moronic
attempt to save the city.

30:44.710 --> 30:46.443
I don't know
how to fight this.

30:46.445 --> 30:47.878
What would you have me do?

30:47.880 --> 30:49.646
You could come up
with a better plan

30:49.648 --> 30:52.316
than irradiating the city
and killing thousands
of people.

30:54.420 --> 30:55.686
(Sighs deeply)

30:58.157 --> 31:01.725
My mother was faced with
this decision on Krypton.

31:01.727 --> 31:03.160
To act or do nothing.

31:03.929 --> 31:05.429
And she chose wrong.

31:07.800 --> 31:11.401
I love her, but she
didn't save Krypton
like she promised.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.941
And my planet died.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.712
My culture.

31:21.714 --> 31:23.780
My home.
My parents.

31:25.050 --> 31:28.185
Everything was just wiped
from the stars.

31:31.657 --> 31:33.190
(Exhales sharply)

31:34.760 --> 31:36.760
How can I let that
happen again?

31:38.330 --> 31:40.297
I know you're scared.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.165
I am too.

31:42.902 --> 31:43.967
But so is Max.

31:43.969 --> 31:45.502
And so is non,
for that matter.

31:45.504 --> 31:48.205
All of you are letting
your fear guide you,

31:48.207 --> 31:52.376
but somebody has to find
the courage to stand up
even though they're afraid.

31:53.946 --> 31:56.546
You know, the worst decisions
that I've ever made

31:56.548 --> 31:59.850
in my life were
based on fear.

32:00.986 --> 32:02.819
But you showed me

32:02.821 --> 32:05.656
that there was another way
to be strong,

32:05.658 --> 32:07.224
by having faith in people.

32:07.226 --> 32:10.260
By believing that
goodness would prevail.

32:12.064 --> 32:14.831
And because of you,
i started letting people in.

32:15.834 --> 32:17.367
(Chuckles)

32:17.369 --> 32:20.103
I even opened up myself up
to my assistant, ker-rah,

32:20.105 --> 32:24.508
who helped me have
a relationship
with my son again.

32:25.978 --> 32:28.045
Now, I can't tell you
what to do, Supergirl.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.646
But if you've
taught me anything,

32:29.648 --> 32:34.051
you have taught me that
hope is stronger than fear.

32:34.053 --> 32:37.988
(Chuckles)
And that is what I think of
every time I look at that.

32:39.358 --> 32:41.491
You've changed me.

32:41.493 --> 32:44.127
And I am not easy to change.

32:44.129 --> 32:47.731
And I believe that
you can change
everyone out there.

32:47.733 --> 32:50.334
Not with violence,
not with fear.

32:51.403 --> 32:54.304
Just be Supergirl.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.907
That's all anyone's
ever needed from you.

32:58.844 --> 33:00.277
Thank you, cat.

33:09.722 --> 33:12.022
That gives me an idea.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.001
The martian.

33:25.371 --> 33:26.903
He's back.

33:29.141 --> 33:30.207
(Grunts)

33:33.278 --> 33:34.177
(Grunts)

33:34.179 --> 33:36.780
What is it?
Are you okay?

33:36.782 --> 33:39.583
This myriad signal
is really strong.

33:39.585 --> 33:42.853
It's taking up a lot of my
mental energy shielding
your mind from it.

33:42.855 --> 33:44.521
Okay, if you have to
sacrifice me...

33:44.523 --> 33:46.323
That's not gonna happen.

33:48.594 --> 33:51.595
Why did you stop me from
telling my mother my father
was still alive?

33:51.597 --> 33:54.197
Until we stop non,
there's nothing we can do
for your father.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.533
Eliza has enough on her plate
worrying about you and Kara.

33:56.535 --> 33:57.601
-(Whooshing)
-(Thuds)

34:09.448 --> 34:10.914
Nice try.

34:12.584 --> 34:14.284
(Chuckles)

34:14.286 --> 34:16.720
You didn't even see me coming.

34:16.722 --> 34:20.924
There was only a 25.6% chance
that you would turn up.

34:20.926 --> 34:23.560
Once again defying the odds.

34:25.931 --> 34:29.199
Just like that time
your people perished

34:30.135 --> 34:33.837
and you alone survived.
(Chuckles)

34:33.839 --> 34:36.273
(Inhales)
Impressive.

34:37.376 --> 34:40.343
But the humans
might call that lucky.

34:42.581 --> 34:43.947
(Grunts)

34:43.949 --> 34:46.016
It has nothing to do
with luck.

34:49.621 --> 34:50.687
(Grunts)

35:33.398 --> 35:34.498
Stand down.

35:35.067 --> 35:36.600
(Alex gasping)

35:36.602 --> 35:40.437
Or I scrape her brain
from her skull.

35:40.439 --> 35:43.573
Alex: J'onn,
don't listen to her. Just...
(Gasps)

35:43.575 --> 35:46.610
Go find Supergirl.
Save the city.

35:48.347 --> 35:50.046
No! No!

35:50.048 --> 35:51.748
(Choking and gasping)

35:57.156 --> 35:59.089
Endangered.

35:59.091 --> 36:00.457
Now extinct.

36:02.027 --> 36:03.527
(Indigo sighs)

36:03.529 --> 36:06.796
I do love
wiping out a species.
(Chuckles)

36:06.798 --> 36:08.798
(Inhales deeply)

36:08.800 --> 36:12.335
And you're next, human.

36:24.016 --> 36:25.849
Good.
You changed your mind.

36:25.851 --> 36:28.718
I was starting to regret
saving it
in the first place.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.921
For the record,
i seriously thought
the two of us

36:30.923 --> 36:33.423
would be having
a lot more fun
during armageddon.

36:33.425 --> 36:36.359
Oh, Max, we're not here
to talk about your bomb.

36:36.361 --> 36:37.961
Supergirl has a plan.

36:37.963 --> 36:39.129
(Chuckles)

36:39.131 --> 36:41.064
Which means
cat browbeat you.

36:41.066 --> 36:42.966
"Inspired" is closer
to the truth.

36:42.968 --> 36:45.101
I'm a muse, Max.

36:45.103 --> 36:46.336
To the world.

36:46.338 --> 36:47.370
(Clicks tongue)

36:47.372 --> 36:50.173
So, what's your plan?

36:51.610 --> 36:53.343
Hope.

36:53.345 --> 36:54.911
You know what?
I'm gonna go with the plan

36:54.913 --> 36:56.980
that has the bomb and
kills the bad guys instead.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.515
No bomb.
No one dies.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.050
You think I wanna do this?
It's the only way to win.

37:00.052 --> 37:01.785
What? What are we winning?

37:01.787 --> 37:04.588
Causing more chaos?
More destruction?

37:04.590 --> 37:06.723
More lives lost?

37:06.725 --> 37:10.627
You hated me for months,
because you thought I'd use
my power indiscriminately,

37:10.629 --> 37:13.663
kill people
with no regard
for their lives.

37:13.665 --> 37:16.299
That is exactly the choice
you're making with this bomb.

37:16.301 --> 37:20.337
Please tell me you've had
enough analysis
to know that she's right.

37:20.339 --> 37:21.504
You were afraid of me.

37:21.506 --> 37:22.806
Now you're afraid of non.

37:24.009 --> 37:26.343
I understand that fear.

37:26.345 --> 37:28.778
But we cannot let it
drive our actions.

37:30.849 --> 37:33.617
Make another choice
that honors your parents.

37:34.620 --> 37:35.819
And mine.

37:40.892 --> 37:42.359
(Breathes deeply)

37:44.196 --> 37:45.595
I'm listening.

37:47.299 --> 37:48.798
Indigo: Wakey-wakey.

37:51.737 --> 37:55.372
-Where am I?
-Non: At the heart
of our operation.

37:55.374 --> 37:58.341
This is where you and astra
have been hiding
all these years?

37:58.710 --> 38:00.377
Yes.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.279
This was our prison.

38:02.714 --> 38:04.914
Our home.

38:04.916 --> 38:08.918
Until you killed her
with a kryptonite sword.

38:08.920 --> 38:14.124
I wanted you wide awake,
so I could see the pain
and fear in your eyes

38:14.126 --> 38:15.425
as you died.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.527
I may have told him
you did the deed.

38:17.929 --> 38:19.929
Sorry.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.598
Astra didn't want this.

38:21.600 --> 38:24.234
After you used the black mercy
on Supergirl,

38:24.236 --> 38:25.969
she came to me,

38:25.971 --> 38:27.871
told me how to save her.

38:27.873 --> 38:30.473
She didn't kill me
when she had the chance.

38:31.076 --> 38:32.842
I'm sure she loved you,

38:32.844 --> 38:34.878
but what you're doing
to national city,

38:34.880 --> 38:37.447
what you're planning
to do to earth,

38:37.449 --> 38:39.316
she lost her taste for it.

38:40.786 --> 38:42.052
Hear her now.

38:44.022 --> 38:47.490
She and your niece
consider themselves sisters.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.059
Family.

38:49.761 --> 38:51.227
Your point?

38:51.229 --> 38:53.363
You want to hurt them both?

38:54.700 --> 38:56.066
I know how.

39:03.342 --> 39:04.841
-(Door opening)
-(Sighs)

39:07.079 --> 39:08.778
Will any of this
equipment work?

39:08.780 --> 39:12.649
Well! No reason
why it shouldn't.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.784
So, you brought us
to your very first,

39:14.786 --> 39:17.821
very out of the way
TV station so we can...

39:17.823 --> 39:20.256
What? Dust off
your daytime Emmy?

39:20.258 --> 39:23.326
No, Max. Actually
we are here to inspire.

39:23.328 --> 39:24.928
We are going to show them
a symbol.

39:24.930 --> 39:27.430
One of optimism, love,
and, yes, hope.

39:27.432 --> 39:32.369
A sight so undeniable,
that people will recognize it
even under this spell.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.773
Where do we start?

39:36.775 --> 39:38.575
Cat: Do you think
you can do it?

39:38.577 --> 39:42.278
We can't stop myriad's signal,
but we can piggyback
off of it.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.247
We're lucky.
This TV station is old.

39:44.249 --> 39:45.782
Not that old.

39:45.784 --> 39:47.050
Not old-old.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.551
But old enough that it uses
broadcast technology

39:48.553 --> 39:51.221
instead of digital.

39:51.223 --> 39:54.424
We can transmit a signal
by calibrating it
to myriad's frequency,

39:54.426 --> 39:56.326
without leaving
any online fingerprints.

39:56.328 --> 39:57.861
Take that, indigo.

39:57.863 --> 40:00.730
It'll ride the wave without
anybody knowing a thing.

40:00.732 --> 40:03.333
-Cat: I have one question
for you, Max.
-Max: Shoot.

40:03.335 --> 40:06.503
The earrings,
how did you know
i would wear them?

40:08.507 --> 40:09.973
I didn't.

40:11.076 --> 40:12.442
I guess

40:13.779 --> 40:15.145
I just had hope.

40:17.282 --> 40:18.681
(Loud bang)

40:19.317 --> 40:20.717
Stay here.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.734
Supergirl: Alex?

40:37.736 --> 40:39.803
What are you doing here?
I told you not to come.

40:39.805 --> 40:42.539
I warned you what would happen
if you worked against me.

40:43.809 --> 40:46.009
I found your
ultimate opponent.

40:46.011 --> 40:48.478
One that knows
your every weakness.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.480
No! (Gasps)

40:52.384 --> 40:55.351
(Stammers) I'm not doing this.

40:55.353 --> 40:57.620
I am not going to
fight my sister.

41:00.225 --> 41:02.759
(Shouting)
Did you hear that, non?

41:02.761 --> 41:05.161
If you want to fight me,
come out here
and do it yourself.

41:05.163 --> 41:06.262
I'm not gonna hurt her.

41:06.264 --> 41:07.697
You have no choice.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.934
Kill Alex danvers
or let her kill you.

41:10.936 --> 41:12.368
Either way...

41:12.370 --> 41:13.770
You lose.

41:17.509 --> 41:19.576
Recognize this?

41:19.578 --> 41:21.945
It's the same sword
your sister used...

41:21.947 --> 41:23.313
To kill astra.

41:23.315 --> 41:24.914
It's almost justice.

41:26.518 --> 41:28.518
Alex, please wake up.

41:28.520 --> 41:29.986
She can't hear you.

41:31.490 --> 41:33.423
Revenge won't bring
astra back.

41:33.425 --> 41:35.992
I don't want
to bring her back.

41:35.994 --> 41:37.627
I want you to join her.
