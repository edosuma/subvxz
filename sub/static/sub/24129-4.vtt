Hurricane Katrina was one

06:27.559 --> 06:29.596
1,800 people died

06:29.630 --> 06:33.289
and 80% of the population
of New Orleans was displaced.

06:33.323 --> 06:35.153
But I'm gonna
shock you here.

06:35.187 --> 06:37.293
The surprising truth is,
Hurricane Katrina

06:37.327 --> 06:39.882
was not the storm
of the century.

06:39.916 --> 06:43.748
In fact, it may have been
as weak as a Category 1

06:43.782 --> 06:45.646
when it hit New Orleans.

06:45.681 --> 06:48.891
Only a Category 1?
Then why all the destruction?

06:48.925 --> 06:50.720
Good question,
Mr. Mountain Man.

06:50.755 --> 06:53.343
The real culprit
wasn't the storm itself,

06:53.378 --> 06:55.794
it was our failure
to prepare for it.

06:55.829 --> 06:59.419
Half of New Orleans
lies below sea level,

06:59.453 --> 07:01.351
which means it relied
on these levees

07:01.386 --> 07:02.801
to control flooding.

07:02.836 --> 07:04.354
But the levees
were constructed

07:04.389 --> 07:07.357
out of sand built atop
porous soil,

07:07.392 --> 07:09.325
which made them
extremely vulnerable

07:09.359 --> 07:12.155
to rapid erosion
during Katrina.

desperately in need

07:23.339 --> 07:25.686

07:42.703 --> 07:44.325
in recent history.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.500
For more, let's go
to the Weather History Channel's

07:46.535 --> 07:49.607
own Mr. Science,
Hurricane Harvey.

07:49.641 --> 07:52.126
That's my name,
and what I'm here to talk about!

07:52.161 --> 07:54.474
Hurricane Harvey
is a textbook example

07:54.508 --> 07:56.855
of how human choices
artificially turned

07:56.890 --> 08:00.514
a minor hurricane
into a devastating flood!

08:00.549 --> 08:02.136
Up until the 1960s,

08:02.171 --> 08:05.795
Houston was naturally protected
from major flooding

08:05.830 --> 08:07.521
thanks to its
coastal prairies,

08:07.556 --> 08:09.040
which absorbed flood waters

08:09.074 --> 08:11.801
before they could do
any damage.

08:11.836 --> 08:13.389
Ooh!

08:13.423 --> 08:17.151
But as the city expanded,
greedy developers

08:17.186 --> 08:21.639
exploited legal loopholes
to pave over those prairies.

08:21.673 --> 08:24.365
And worse, they didn't even
tell new residents

08:24.400 --> 08:27.437
that they now lived
in a flood zone.

08:27.472 --> 08:31.441
So, when Harvey hit,
the water had nowhere to go,

08:31.476 --> 08:35.342
and 47,000 people
were displaced.

08:35.376 --> 08:37.551
And worst of all,
my breakfast is ruined.

08:37.586 --> 08:38.759
Back to you, Adam!

08:38.794 --> 08:39.760
[chuckling]
Harvey.

08:39.795 --> 08:41.175
So that area only flooded

08:41.210 --> 08:43.695
because of how humans
modified the land?

08:43.730 --> 08:45.525
It's unbelievable!

08:45.559 --> 08:47.596
Okay, what about
Maria, huh?

08:47.630 --> 08:49.563
That storm was huge.

08:49.598 --> 08:51.531
Good question!
For more on that,

08:51.565 --> 08:53.843
let's go to our
time-traveling storm chaser,

08:53.878 --> 08:55.914

who's on the scene

08:55.949 --> 08:57.467
at Hurricane Maria.

08:57.502 --> 08:58.468
Thanks, Adam!

08:58.503 --> 09:00.574
Every time
there's a major storm,

09:00.609 --> 09:03.577
the media sends dopes like me
to stand outside

09:03.612 --> 09:06.028
and get rained on
for your amusement.

09:06.062 --> 09:07.581
But the truth is,

09:07.616 --> 09:09.928
it wasn't the wind and rain
that was responsible

09:09.963 --> 09:12.310
for the estimated
thousands of lives lost

09:12.344 --> 09:13.967
in Puerto Rico.

09:14.001 --> 09:15.900
It was because
after the storm...

09:18.074 --> 09:21.146
...the island went 84 days
without water

09:21.181 --> 09:23.908
and 64 days
without electricity.

09:23.942 --> 09:26.566
The corporate corruption
and government neglect

09:26.600 --> 09:29.396
that led to those failures
was the real killer.

09:29.430 --> 09:32.813
Back to you, Adam.
I'm going the [bleep] inside.

09:32.848 --> 09:34.401
So, all those people died

09:34.435 --> 09:35.816
and we could have
prevented it?

09:35.851 --> 09:38.578
Yes.
But I'm afraid the problem

09:38.612 --> 09:41.788
is much bigger than just
a failure to prepare.

09:41.822 --> 09:43.790
Our collective impact
on the planet

09:43.824 --> 09:47.310
has led to climate change
on such a massive scale,

09:47.345 --> 09:50.728
it's actually
making disasters stronger.

09:50.762 --> 09:53.178
And for more on that,
we have Dr. Michael Mann,

09:53.213 --> 09:54.939
distinguished professor
of atmospheric science

09:54.973 --> 09:56.975

09:57.010 --> 09:58.805
Always a pleasure to appear
on a parody

09:58.839 --> 10:00.116
of the Weather Channel, Adam.

10:00.151 --> 10:01.911
And you're right,
we can say

10:01.946 --> 10:03.603
with a great degree
of confidence

10:03.637 --> 10:05.501
that climate change
is making hurricanes

10:05.535 --> 10:07.641
and other weather disasters
more extreme.

10:07.676 --> 10:09.954
Now, Michael,
how is that possible?

10:09.988 --> 10:11.921
Explain it to me like
I'm a five-year-old

10:11.956 --> 10:14.096
who hates science
and thinks climate change

10:14.130 --> 10:16.201
is a hippie crack-pot
conspiracy.

10:16.236 --> 10:18.756
When you burn fossil fuels,
you warm the atmosphere,

10:18.790 --> 10:20.274
you warm the ocean.

10:20.309 --> 10:23.105
A warmer atmosphere
holds more moisture,

10:23.139 --> 10:25.176
so these storms produce
more rainfall.

10:25.210 --> 10:26.798
For every additional
degree of warmth,

10:26.833 --> 10:28.938
wind speeds
for the strongest storms

10:28.973 --> 10:31.147
increase by about
10 miles per hour.

10:31.182 --> 10:33.943
Now, that translates
to a nearly 25% increase

10:33.978 --> 10:35.773
in the destructiveness
of these storms.

10:35.807 --> 10:37.671
The warming also
slows down the jet stream,

10:37.706 --> 10:40.778
so these storms stay parked
in the same spot for longer,

10:40.812 --> 10:43.332
giving you even more rainfall
and worse flooding.

10:43.366 --> 10:45.230
Not only that,
climate change has caused

10:45.265 --> 10:47.647
unprecedented wildfires
in North America

10:47.681 --> 10:48.717
in recent years.

10:48.751 --> 10:51.029
Global warming gives you
more heat waves,

10:51.064 --> 10:53.342
it dries out forests,
so you get larger,

10:53.376 --> 10:54.895
more destructive wildfires.

10:54.930 --> 10:56.656
The truth is, Birch,
human activity is making

10:56.690 --> 10:59.175
extreme weather events
more destructive.

10:59.210 --> 11:01.661
And if we continue
to burn fossil fuels

11:01.695 --> 11:03.697
and put carbon pollution
into the atmosphere,

11:03.732 --> 11:05.803
we are gonna see
worse and worse droughts,

11:05.837 --> 11:09.669
heat waves, superstorms,
floods, and wildfires.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.187
That's unbelievable.

11:11.222 --> 11:12.395
Believe it.

11:12.430 --> 11:15.813
As mighty as nature is,
our impact on the planet

11:15.847 --> 11:16.814
is even greater.

11:16.848 --> 11:19.713
See, this is why
we need to be protecting

11:19.748 --> 11:21.819
and preserving our planet,

11:21.853 --> 11:25.270
not choking it to death
with our noxious emissions!

11:25.305 --> 11:26.927
God, I cannot wait
to get back

11:26.962 --> 11:29.758
to pure, wild,
untrammeled nature!

11:29.792 --> 11:31.691
[grunts]

11:31.725 --> 11:33.554
What Birch hasn't
fully absorbed yet

11:33.589 --> 11:37.731
is that no spot on Earth
is free from human impact.

11:37.766 --> 11:39.457
We all affect nature.

11:39.491 --> 11:42.425
Every breath you take,
every move you make...

11:42.460 --> 11:44.048
I'll be watching you.

11:44.082 --> 11:46.015
Now, this is why
I love climatologists.

11:46.050 --> 11:47.603
You folks are hilarious.

11:51.055 --> 11:52.435
[birds chirping]

11:52.470 --> 11:53.954
[sighing]
Finally...

11:53.989 --> 11:57.924
pure, pristine,
unadulterated nature.

11:57.958 --> 12:00.374
[Adam, in British accent]
Observe the homo sapien.

12:00.409 --> 12:04.724
He believes he is a humble,
respectful visitor in nature.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.554
But little does he know,
his very presence on this planet

12:07.588 --> 12:10.246
irreparably changes it.Hey, who is talking?!

12:10.281 --> 12:12.939
In anger, he tears
at the undergrowth,

12:12.973 --> 12:15.217
revealing our trusty narrator.

12:15.251 --> 12:17.909
Like all humans,
he wreaks havoc on nature

12:17.944 --> 12:19.566
wherever he goes.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.569
Okay, David Atten-Boring,
that is not true.

12:22.603 --> 12:23.950
I preserve nature.

12:23.984 --> 12:25.606
I donate to
the National Parks Foundation,

12:25.641 --> 12:26.746
I am on the board--

12:26.780 --> 12:28.886
The human chatters
in protest,

12:28.920 --> 12:31.267
not realizing that even
national parks

12:31.302 --> 12:33.580
are human-made constructions.What?

12:33.614 --> 12:37.653
In fact, the man who conceived
of the very idea, John Muir,

12:37.687 --> 12:41.001
himself irreparably
altered an entire ecosystem

12:41.036 --> 12:43.901
in American's greatest park,
Yosemite.

12:43.935 --> 12:45.765
Ah, there he is now,

12:45.799 --> 12:49.078
entering Yosemite
for the very first time.

12:49.113 --> 12:51.011
My goodness!

12:51.046 --> 12:55.188
We must preserve this pristine
and untrammeled wilderness.

12:55.222 --> 12:59.019
But the truth is,
it wasn't untrammeled at all.

12:59.054 --> 13:00.918
Are you gonna do that voice
for the whole time?

13:00.952 --> 13:01.988
[in normal voice]
Nah, that was enough.

13:02.022 --> 13:04.128
The Ahwahnechee People
had made their home

13:04.162 --> 13:06.268
in the area
we now know as Yosemite

13:06.302 --> 13:09.340
for at least 3,500 years.

13:09.374 --> 13:13.033
But Muir didn't consider them
natural in the least.

13:13.068 --> 13:17.555
These people are most ugly,
some altogether hideous.

13:17.589 --> 13:20.696
They have no right place
in the landscape.

13:20.730 --> 13:21.697
Get them out of here!

13:21.731 --> 13:22.802
[rifle cocking]

13:22.836 --> 13:24.804
Wait, the father
of America's national parks

13:24.838 --> 13:26.391
believed in ethnic cleansing?

13:26.426 --> 13:28.014
Pretty much, yeah.

13:28.048 --> 13:29.705
But what Muir
didn't realize

13:29.739 --> 13:32.052
was the supposedly pristine
nature he found

13:32.087 --> 13:34.641
was in fact created
by the Ahwahnechee,

13:34.675 --> 13:37.575
because for millennia,
they had cultivated the land

13:37.609 --> 13:39.888
by selectively pruning plants,
sowing seeds,

13:39.922 --> 13:41.855
and setting controlled fires.

13:41.890 --> 13:43.132
What?

13:43.167 --> 13:45.238
But forest fires
are bad, right?

13:45.272 --> 13:46.480
To the contrary.

13:46.515 --> 13:48.310
Forest fires
are actually necessary

13:48.344 --> 13:50.312
to maintain the health
of a forest.

13:50.346 --> 13:51.900
And by conducting
controlled burns,

13:51.934 --> 13:53.729
the Ahwahnechee
cleared undergrowth

13:53.763 --> 13:56.145
and made space
for new plants to grow,

13:56.180 --> 13:57.871
increasing biodiversity.

13:57.906 --> 14:00.978
Only we can start
forest fires.

14:01.012 --> 14:03.912
[gun cocking]

14:03.946 --> 14:06.707
After they were kicked out,
the undergrowth returned,

14:06.742 --> 14:08.399
and without regular
controlled fires,

14:08.433 --> 14:10.608
the forest became
twice as dense,

14:10.642 --> 14:14.681
and as more vegetation had
to compete for water, drier.

14:14.715 --> 14:16.994
So now, instead of many
small controlled burns,

14:17.028 --> 14:21.412
Yosemite is more prone
to rare-but-extreme wildfires.

14:22.620 --> 14:25.105
Muir didn't preserve
Yosemite's landscape

14:25.140 --> 14:27.521
he completely altered it.

14:27.556 --> 14:30.007
What?!
I thought that conversation

14:30.041 --> 14:34.011
was all about preserving nature
in its natural state--

14:34.045 --> 14:35.909
to have as little
impact as possible.

14:35.944 --> 14:38.118
Sorry.
Try as we might,

14:38.153 --> 14:40.914
our species is incapable
of having no impact

14:40.949 --> 14:42.226
on the natural world.

14:42.260 --> 14:46.540
Everywhere we go
is affected by our presence.

14:46.575 --> 14:48.646
Simply going on a hike
in the woods

14:48.680 --> 14:50.820
changes the ecosystem you visit.

14:50.855 --> 14:52.719
One study found
that hiking trails

14:52.753 --> 14:55.032
create a corridor of impact,

14:55.066 --> 14:57.241
wherein wildlife reacts
to human presence

14:57.275 --> 15:00.969
up to 100 meters
on either side of the trail.

15:01.003 --> 15:03.143
And just by traveling
from place to place,

15:03.178 --> 15:05.145
we introduce non-native species

15:05.180 --> 15:07.734
into new environments
all the time,

15:07.768 --> 15:09.943
even if it's just
the tiny bacteria

15:09.978 --> 15:11.980
and fungi on your shoes.

15:12.014 --> 15:13.567
[Birch]
But people have to travel.

15:13.602 --> 15:15.293
How am I supposed
to protect nature

15:15.328 --> 15:16.916
if I can't even get to it?

15:16.950 --> 15:18.848
[Adam]
The truth is,
there quite literally

15:18.883 --> 15:20.574
isn't a spot on Earth

15:20.609 --> 15:24.095
that hasn't been impacted
by humanity's existence.

15:24.130 --> 15:25.959
The Atlantic Ocean
is so crowded

15:25.994 --> 15:28.065
with fishing boats,
shipping lines,

15:28.099 --> 15:30.067
undersea cables
and chemical runoff,

15:30.101 --> 15:32.310
that right whales
now effectively live

15:32.345 --> 15:35.589
in a noisy and polluted
underwater city.

15:35.624 --> 15:37.764
To feed our massive appetite,

15:37.798 --> 15:40.801
humanity now breeds
so much livestock

15:40.836 --> 15:42.251
that our animal food supply

15:42.286 --> 15:44.944
outweighs all other
terrestrial mammals

15:44.978 --> 15:47.325
by 14 times.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.949
We've even changed
the air itself.

15:49.983 --> 15:52.986
5,000 years ago
the dawn of rice farming

15:53.021 --> 15:55.678
released so much methane
into the atmosphere

15:55.713 --> 15:58.440
it actually thwarted
a second Ice Age.

15:58.474 --> 16:00.856
And thanks to increased
forest clearing,

16:00.890 --> 16:03.307
factory emissions,
electricity generation,

16:03.341 --> 16:05.654
and transportation,
every breath we take

16:05.688 --> 16:09.175
now contains 41% more
carbon dioxide

16:09.209 --> 16:12.281
than it did in 1750.

16:12.316 --> 16:14.904
The hard truth is,
human activity

16:14.939 --> 16:17.528
is altering the Earth's
fundamental systems

16:17.562 --> 16:20.980
on such a massive scale,
scientists believe

16:21.014 --> 16:24.121
we've actually entered
a new geological age--

16:24.155 --> 16:26.019
the Anthropocene.

16:26.054 --> 16:28.125
[woman]
Otherwise known
as the Age of Humans.

16:28.159 --> 16:29.885
[Adam]
Birch, this is Emma Marris,

16:29.919 --> 16:31.887
a science writer
who's written extensively

16:31.921 --> 16:32.992
about the Anthropocene.

16:33.026 --> 16:35.649
But pure nature must
exist somewhere, right?

16:35.684 --> 16:37.755
I've seen it in
nature documentaries.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.515
Actually, those documentaries
are part of the problem.

16:39.550 --> 16:41.000
They're usually filmed
as if they're in

16:41.034 --> 16:43.036
a vast wilderness
filled with animals.

16:43.071 --> 16:45.314
But often, they're filmed
right by the road,

16:45.349 --> 16:46.936
and they just cut it
out of the shot.

16:46.971 --> 16:47.937
[horn honking]

16:47.972 --> 16:50.147
What?
No!

16:50.181 --> 16:51.907
The truth is,
the majority of the Earth

16:51.941 --> 16:54.220
is neither totally humanized
or totally wild.

16:54.254 --> 16:55.773
It's somewhere in between.

16:55.807 --> 16:58.569
We've altered three-quarters
of the land on Earth.

16:58.603 --> 17:01.606
We have dammed rivers,
we have acidified the oceans,

17:01.641 --> 17:04.402
we have pumped the atmosphere
full of carbon dioxide,

17:04.437 --> 17:06.508
and we have moved
plants and animals around

17:06.542 --> 17:08.061
on a massive scale.

17:08.096 --> 17:11.444
And our effects on the planet
threaten life on Earth.

17:11.478 --> 17:14.343
Our impact is immense
and deeply scary.

17:14.378 --> 17:17.760
Entire ecosystems are on
the verge of being wiped out.

17:17.795 --> 17:19.417
And because we transformed
their homes

17:19.452 --> 17:20.970
and turned up
the temperature,

17:21.005 --> 17:23.042
and introduced
new predators,

17:23.076 --> 17:25.354
many species are on
the verge of extinction.

17:25.389 --> 17:27.253
A meteor triggered
the mass extinction

17:27.287 --> 17:28.978
that wiped out the dinosaurs.

17:29.013 --> 17:32.430
And unless we make
drastic changes in how we live,

17:32.465 --> 17:34.536
we could be the next meteor.

17:34.570 --> 17:36.710
And although
the planet will survive,

17:36.745 --> 17:38.367
our impact will be felt

17:38.402 --> 17:40.645
in the geological record
for eternity.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.579
So, there's no pristine,
untouched nature to preserve.

17:43.614 --> 17:45.133
I'm afraid not.

17:45.167 --> 17:47.100
Well, how do I go on living
in a world like that?

17:47.135 --> 17:48.274
Don't lose heart, Birch.

17:48.308 --> 17:50.276
There's still so much
we can do to protect

17:50.310 --> 17:51.277
the nature right
in our own back--

17:51.311 --> 17:55.108
No, Adam!
Just leave me here to die.

17:55.143 --> 17:58.387
There's nothing left
to talk about.

17:58.422 --> 18:00.113
Man, he is taking
this hard.

18:00.148 --> 18:02.736
Pfft.
Nature bros.

18:02.771 --> 18:04.013
[whistling theme]

18:06.257 --> 18:08.570
Just leave me here
to die, Adam.

18:08.604 --> 18:09.743
What's the point of living

18:09.778 --> 18:12.229
if there's no more nature
to protect?

18:12.263 --> 18:14.472
No matter how I try
and minimize my impact,

18:14.507 --> 18:16.612
it's too late!

18:16.647 --> 18:19.960
Forest beasts and insects come!

18:19.995 --> 18:23.309
Feast upon my pitiful
human flesh!

18:23.343 --> 18:26.415
Return me to the earth
so that I may harm you no more.

18:26.450 --> 18:29.004
Yikes.
Birch, you are taking this

18:29.038 --> 18:30.281
too hard, man.

18:30.316 --> 18:32.628
Yeah, I think
I see the problem.

18:32.663 --> 18:34.251
Birch, if you try
to define nature

18:34.285 --> 18:37.495
as a place that's totally
untouched by humanity,

18:37.530 --> 18:40.498
yeah, you're not gonna
find that on this planet.

18:40.533 --> 18:42.845
But I think you just have
the wrong definition.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.642
Instead, you could
define nature

18:46.677 --> 18:48.886
as anywhere
where live thrives,

18:48.920 --> 18:51.647
anywhere where there's
multiple species interacting.

18:51.682 --> 18:54.202
And when you do that,
something kind of
amazing happens.

18:54.236 --> 18:56.549
This becomes just as much
a part of nature

18:56.583 --> 18:57.895
as Yosemite is.

18:57.929 --> 18:59.621
Even a city park
like this one

18:59.655 --> 19:03.728
is full of diverse plants,
insects, and other species,

19:03.763 --> 19:05.868
including humans!

19:05.903 --> 19:08.077
We're a part
of nature too.

19:08.112 --> 19:11.391
And yes, that means
we can't help but impact it.

19:11.426 --> 19:14.463
But we're unique among
all these species

19:14.498 --> 19:17.190
in that we can
understand and change

19:17.225 --> 19:18.709
the impact we're having.

19:18.743 --> 19:22.575
And that gives us the power
and the responsibility

19:22.609 --> 19:24.473
to nourish and protect
the natural world.

19:24.508 --> 19:26.682
The trends we talked
about today are troubling.

19:26.717 --> 19:29.375
But we can slow
and even reverse them

19:29.409 --> 19:31.687
if we act now to fight
climate change,

19:31.722 --> 19:34.173
and to protect not just
the nature out there,

19:34.207 --> 19:37.486
but also the nature
here in our own backyards.

19:37.521 --> 19:39.523
And that way,
you and everyone

19:39.557 --> 19:41.732
can have a life filled
with nature every day.

19:41.766 --> 19:43.527
And now, if you'll excuse me,

19:43.561 --> 19:46.012
I'm gonna do a little
urban bird watching.

19:46.046 --> 19:47.013
[bird calling]

19:47.047 --> 19:49.118
[gasps]
A bufflehead?

19:49.153 --> 19:51.569
This time of year?
Amazing.

19:53.433 --> 19:54.572
Wow.

19:54.607 --> 19:56.367
You know, I never
thought of it that way.

19:56.402 --> 19:58.438
I don't have to go out
into the wilderness

19:58.473 --> 19:59.888
to commune with nature.

19:59.922 --> 20:02.856
It's all around me!
[laughs]

20:02.891 --> 20:05.238
Hello, anas platyrhynchos!

20:05.273 --> 20:06.757
[duck quacking]

20:06.791 --> 20:10.864
And hello to you,
muhlenbergia rigens.

20:10.899 --> 20:13.867
And a heartfelt hello
to you...

20:13.902 --> 20:16.111
homo sapiens.

20:16.145 --> 20:17.699
Birch, you're back.

20:17.733 --> 20:19.770
I thought you said
city hikes were beneath you

20:19.804 --> 20:22.221
and you needed to climb
Mount Everest to "escape."

20:22.255 --> 20:24.395
[clears throat]
My fellow outdoors people!

20:24.430 --> 20:26.397
Please, forgive me.

20:26.432 --> 20:28.399
I now see the error
of my ways.

20:28.434 --> 20:30.953
This urban park is worthy
of as much respect

20:30.988 --> 20:32.472
as the highest peaks.

20:32.507 --> 20:36.062
Will you accept me
back into your fold?

20:36.096 --> 20:37.374
Uh... sure.

20:37.408 --> 20:38.375
We're leaving now, though.

20:38.409 --> 20:40.446
Oh!
[laughs]

20:40.480 --> 20:42.724
Oh, Adam, I can't
thank you enough.

20:42.758 --> 20:44.967
I now feel more
in touch with nature

20:45.002 --> 20:46.900
than I ever did before.

20:46.935 --> 20:48.937
Would you like
to join our hike?

20:48.971 --> 20:50.283
I would love to!
I even brought a snack.

20:50.318 --> 20:52.251
My patented trail bologna.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.770
Um... never mind.

20:54.805 --> 20:57.497
Okay, haha, more for me!

20:57.532 --> 21:00.293
Mm!
Sweet and slimy!

21:00.328 --> 21:02.502
[chuckles]
Mm!

21:02.537 --> 21:03.676
[whistling theme]

21:04.780 --> 21:05.919
Okay, so we're here
at Griffith Park,

21:05.954 --> 21:07.335
which is the big park in LA.

21:07.369 --> 21:08.577
And we've been
shooting here all day.

21:08.612 --> 21:11.270
You keep pointing out all
these animals all around us.

21:11.304 --> 21:13.202
Well, we keep getting
practically interrupted

21:13.237 --> 21:14.480
by, like, herds of deer,

21:14.514 --> 21:17.448
and red-tail hawks come
swooping out of the sky,

21:17.483 --> 21:20.624
and there's acorn woodpeckers
flitting amongst us.

21:20.658 --> 21:22.004
We're shooting a scene
where it's supposed

21:22.039 --> 21:23.212
to be ecological
devastation,

21:23.247 --> 21:25.042
and we're getting,
like, mobbed by wildlife.

21:25.076 --> 21:26.492
So, that's your point, right?

21:26.526 --> 21:28.701
That, like, there's so much
nature all around us

21:28.735 --> 21:30.289
that we don't--
we don't even acknowledge.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.945
Yeah, I mean,
it's one of my points,

21:31.980 --> 21:33.119
one of my many points,
but I think--
Sure.

21:33.153 --> 21:34.431
You have-- your one
of many points.

21:34.465 --> 21:36.191
But I do, I think that,
you know,

21:36.225 --> 21:39.125
we've been sort of trained
in part by nature documentaries

21:39.159 --> 21:40.954
to see nature as something
that's far away

21:40.989 --> 21:42.162
and out there...
Right.

21:42.197 --> 21:43.785
...and it's something
that only rich people

21:43.819 --> 21:44.993
can afford to access.

21:45.027 --> 21:47.306
And often, that means
that we just don't have

21:47.340 --> 21:49.066
our nature eyes on when
we're just walking

21:49.100 --> 21:50.792
around the city,
but there's tons here.

21:50.826 --> 21:53.312
And your philosophy is,
make more nature

21:53.346 --> 21:54.520
everywhere we can.
Yes.

21:54.554 --> 21:56.245
And the nice thing
about not fixating

21:56.280 --> 21:58.800
on this sort of super-pristine
untouched nature,

21:58.834 --> 22:01.354
is that you can't make
more of that stuff.

22:01.389 --> 22:03.874
Mm.
You can't make more
of untouched nature.

22:03.908 --> 22:05.703
Right.
But you can make
more nature.

22:05.738 --> 22:08.188
You can take a place
that's denuded of species,

22:08.223 --> 22:10.812
and you can bring that
biodiversity level up.

22:10.846 --> 22:14.229
I read a study recently
that since 1970,

22:14.263 --> 22:17.474
like, 60% of wildlife
has declined

22:17.508 --> 22:19.648
in areas that we thought
were, hey, wild,

22:19.683 --> 22:21.167
and the animals
just hanging out there.

22:21.201 --> 22:23.238
How do we remain optimistic
when that's happening?

22:23.272 --> 22:25.758
Well, we need to take those
declines really seriously.

22:25.792 --> 22:27.484
But I think that
it's important to realize

22:27.518 --> 22:31.177
that those are declines in
the numbers of each species,

22:31.211 --> 22:33.282
not in the numbers
of species, right?
Okay.

22:33.317 --> 22:35.664
So 60% of species
aren't extinct.

22:35.699 --> 22:38.184
It's just many species
are on these downward trends.

22:38.218 --> 22:39.530
Got it.
So, the bad news is,

22:39.565 --> 22:40.704
the numbers of animals
are going down

22:40.738 --> 22:42.395
'cause we are
squeezing them out.

22:42.430 --> 22:43.914
Mm-hmm.But the good news is,

22:43.948 --> 22:46.399
is that there's still time
to turn the ship around.

22:46.434 --> 22:48.781
There is still time
to reform our ways

22:48.815 --> 22:51.370
and to change our ways so that
these species can come back.

22:51.404 --> 22:53.510
How do we do that?
What-- what are things
that people can do?

22:53.544 --> 22:55.408
Well, there's a bunch
of really important

22:55.443 --> 22:56.858
structural things
that we need to do, right?

22:56.892 --> 22:58.618
So, we can all be super-good,

22:58.653 --> 23:00.413
and we can all
have our bag

23:00.448 --> 23:01.863
that we take
to the grocery store.

23:01.897 --> 23:03.382
[laughing]
The canvas bag, yeah, yeah.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.384
The canvas bags.
But what we really
need to do

23:05.418 --> 23:07.420
is we really need to have,
like, big, big changes

23:07.455 --> 23:09.595
in how-- in what kind
of fuels we're using,

23:09.629 --> 23:11.390
the kind of energy mix
that we're using.

23:11.424 --> 23:13.771
Yeah.
How we're permitting
development.

23:13.806 --> 23:16.118
Those new roads that
you think are inevitable,

23:16.153 --> 23:18.569
like, we can decide not
to build those new roads.

23:18.604 --> 23:20.399
Or build them differently
or put them in different
places, or...

23:20.433 --> 23:21.607
Yeah, right.

23:21.641 --> 23:24.092
You know, there are big
systemic things to do.

23:24.126 --> 23:25.542
So, I actually think that
the most important thing

23:25.576 --> 23:27.060
that we can do
as individuals

23:27.095 --> 23:29.235
is get a little bit
politically involved.

23:29.269 --> 23:30.339
Mm.Actually,
that's more important

23:30.374 --> 23:31.824
than the whole
shopping bag thing.

23:31.858 --> 23:33.239
I mean, we've all been
sort of trained

23:33.273 --> 23:34.965
that the way
we can be good people

23:34.999 --> 23:36.484
is being good consumers

23:36.518 --> 23:38.002
and buying the right kind
of green stuff.

23:38.037 --> 23:39.590
But I think that
it's actually better

23:39.625 --> 23:41.765
to occasionally just feed
your kids a frozen pizza,

23:41.799 --> 23:43.352
and then go to
the city council meeting

23:43.387 --> 23:45.113
and make sure that
the zoning laws...Right, right.

23:45.147 --> 23:48.012
...in your town are conducive
to biodiversity.

23:48.047 --> 23:50.152
It is really dire.

23:50.187 --> 23:52.741
Situation is bad.
There's a lot of work to do.

23:52.776 --> 23:54.743
But the message that I hope
that we can bring across

23:54.778 --> 23:57.332
is that it isn't
too late, right?

23:57.366 --> 23:59.921
Because if it's too late,
then people stop trying
to make a change.

23:59.955 --> 24:02.751
Right.The goals that are important
to me are stopping extinctions,

24:02.786 --> 24:04.995
increasing biodiversity,
making sure that everybody

24:05.029 --> 24:07.515
and their brother
has access to nature.

24:07.549 --> 24:10.034
Right.
Those are goals

24:10.069 --> 24:12.451
that are achievable, right?

24:12.485 --> 24:15.454
And they don't involve
trying to go back in time.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.939
It's a changing world,
it's not gonna go back

24:17.973 --> 24:20.113
to some pristine,
pure state.

24:20.148 --> 24:22.771
And there never
was some magical day

24:22.806 --> 24:24.601
that everything was right
with the world.

24:24.635 --> 24:26.810
Yeah.
We just gotta
keep figuring out

24:26.844 --> 24:29.606
how can we make a better
world looking forward.Yeah.

24:29.640 --> 24:32.091
Thank you so much for coming.
I really appreciate it.Yeah, thank you
for having me.
