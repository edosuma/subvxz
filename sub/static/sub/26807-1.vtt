00:47.053 --> 00:48.188
Hey.

00:48.956 --> 00:50.021
- Welcome.
- Hi.

00:50.023 --> 00:51.155
Hi, Hodja.

00:51.157 --> 00:52.758
Madam, I have some
delicious oil for you.

00:52.760 --> 00:53.991
Wow.

00:53.993 --> 00:55.793
- Wow.
- That's amazing.

00:55.795 --> 00:57.462
All the best quality...

00:57.464 --> 00:59.798
Come see
the hand-woven carpets.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.700
...home-grown dates.

01:01.702 --> 01:03.935
Fresh figs.

01:03.937 --> 01:07.005
Home-grown dates,
fresh figs.

01:11.978 --> 01:13.211
...ladies and gentlemen.

01:13.213 --> 01:14.414
This way.

01:20.254 --> 01:21.919
Last one's a rotten egg.

01:32.665 --> 01:33.732
Some bread, sir?

01:38.772 --> 01:39.740
Huh?

01:46.180 --> 01:49.413
I'm still half asleep, Raya.

01:49.415 --> 01:51.416
You should have seen
where I was in my dream.

01:51.418 --> 01:53.252
It was the most
amazing city,

01:53.254 --> 01:54.889
filled with people and,

01:55.689 --> 01:57.321
well, they were so kind.

01:57.323 --> 01:59.591
They offered me
all sorts of things.

02:00.561 --> 02:02.026
Those smells.

02:02.028 --> 02:04.363
It was such
an amazing atmosphere.

02:04.365 --> 02:07.898
Oh, all the world
is so big, Raya.

02:07.900 --> 02:11.270
It reaches all the way
to the blue mountains.

02:11.272 --> 02:13.875
And behind the blue mountains
is even more world.

02:14.774 --> 02:17.811
And behind them,
you can see even more.

02:19.613 --> 02:23.248
That really is quite
a lot of world, Raya,

02:23.250 --> 02:25.217
that we've never seen.

02:25.219 --> 02:28.587
Wouldn't it be cool to go on
an adventure together, Raya?

02:28.589 --> 02:29.820
You and me...

02:29.822 --> 02:31.290
...the fantastic duo.

02:31.292 --> 02:34.058
Conquering the world.
Me and goat, forever.

02:35.863 --> 02:36.695
Ugh.

02:36.697 --> 02:39.931
Oh, Raya. Why didn't you
say something?

02:39.933 --> 02:41.533
Now we're late
for milking time.

02:41.535 --> 02:43.968
Ugh, Mom will go crazy.

02:43.970 --> 02:45.236
Come on.

02:45.238 --> 02:46.837
Hurry.

03:14.802 --> 03:16.037
Be careful, son.

03:17.772 --> 03:20.639
You can't barge into me
like that when I'm busy working.

03:20.641 --> 03:23.241
But you're sitting
in a bad spot there, Aram.

03:24.577 --> 03:26.344
Can't you sit somewhere
that's not in front of the gate?

03:26.346 --> 03:29.213
And how often have I told you
to come home on time

03:29.215 --> 03:31.315
and before it
gets dark, Hodja?

03:31.317 --> 03:33.318
The poor animal's
about to explode.

03:33.320 --> 03:34.685
There, there, Raya.

03:34.687 --> 03:35.555
Here.

03:36.556 --> 03:38.792
Hodja, it's time
you learnt to sew.

03:39.125 --> 03:40.958
But...

03:40.960 --> 03:42.326
I don't think
I can do it.

03:42.328 --> 03:43.861
Ah, here.

03:43.863 --> 03:45.032
You'll soon learn how.

03:46.566 --> 03:49.367
The thread
is too long, Dad.

03:49.369 --> 03:51.770
Or maybe my T-Rex arms
are too short.

03:52.839 --> 03:56.040
Come on, boys.
The date soup is served.

03:56.042 --> 03:58.042
Mmm, date soup.

04:00.280 --> 04:01.616
Eat it up now.

04:12.393 --> 04:15.993
How often do I have to tell you
that goats eat up on the mountain

04:15.995 --> 04:18.363
where they serve grass?

04:18.365 --> 04:22.234
Do you think I can afford to roll out
the white table cloth for a goat?

04:22.236 --> 04:24.135
It's not bank notes
I'm sewing.

04:24.137 --> 04:27.104
But Dad, Raya's
not just any goat.

04:27.106 --> 04:28.507
Raya's my sister.

04:28.509 --> 04:30.709
Your sister?
What nonsense is that?

04:30.711 --> 04:32.777
If that goat's your sister,

04:32.779 --> 04:34.178
your mother is...

04:34.180 --> 04:36.647
His mother is a what now?

04:36.649 --> 04:39.017
Well, if it's a problem,

04:39.019 --> 04:41.652
you could just be
completely free of us kids.

04:41.654 --> 04:45.222
Because Raya and I are ready to
go out into the big wide world.

04:45.224 --> 04:46.190
Isn't that right, Raya?

04:47.527 --> 04:50.161
Hodja, there's nothing
for you out there.

04:50.163 --> 04:53.397
Mixing country folk with the
fine city folk, it's of no use.

04:53.399 --> 04:55.467
It's like mixing dates
with shawarmas.

04:55.469 --> 04:56.767
It simply doesn't work.

04:56.769 --> 04:58.370
I just want to see the world.

04:59.539 --> 05:01.705
You're not going to see
any world, Hodja.

05:01.707 --> 05:03.875
You must stay here
and concentrate on your sewing

05:03.877 --> 05:06.811
so you can be a tailor,
just like your father.

05:06.813 --> 05:08.313
No, I will not.

05:08.315 --> 05:09.448
Oh, yes you will.

05:09.450 --> 05:10.748
- No.
- Yes.

05:10.750 --> 05:11.515
- No.
- Yes.

05:11.517 --> 05:12.484
- No!
- Yes.

05:12.486 --> 05:13.418
- No!
- Careful.

05:13.420 --> 05:14.852
- No! No!
- Yes!

05:14.854 --> 05:16.890
You must!

05:18.192 --> 05:19.394
Hmm?

05:22.896 --> 05:24.328
Aram, listen.

05:24.330 --> 05:26.063
The boy has ambitions.

05:26.065 --> 05:28.666
I don't want to discuss
this any further.

05:28.668 --> 05:31.503
You stay here and the become
a tailor's apprentice. End of.

05:31.505 --> 05:33.871
You can forget about
the tailoring, okay?

05:33.873 --> 05:35.073
I don't wanna do it.

05:35.075 --> 05:36.942
And besides, I can't.

05:36.944 --> 05:39.044
I don't have time to become
a tailor's apprentice.

05:39.046 --> 05:41.046
I have to take care of Raya.

05:41.048 --> 05:44.349
But, if there was someone else
who could be goatherd,

05:44.351 --> 05:47.021
maybe then I might
have the time.

05:47.620 --> 05:49.387
Well, I'm off to bed.

05:49.389 --> 05:51.192
Come on, Raya.

05:52.692 --> 05:53.661
Hmm.

05:54.695 --> 05:58.096
I'm sure he really
would like to be a tailor,

05:58.098 --> 05:59.563
but he's sort of right.

05:59.565 --> 06:02.036
That goat need to be cared for.

06:04.971 --> 06:07.606
Jamila, my darling.

06:07.608 --> 06:10.442
Wouldn't you like to take care
of Raya for awhile?

06:10.444 --> 06:12.613
Seeing how you love animals.

06:14.214 --> 06:15.746
You can forget that.

06:15.748 --> 06:19.052
I have enough work
caring for one old goat.

06:24.791 --> 06:27.962
I'll just go over and return
El Faza's kaftan.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.500
<i>Assalamu Alaikum</i>, Mr. Faza.

06:35.502 --> 06:37.568
<i>Assalamu Alaikum</i>, sir.

06:37.570 --> 06:39.871
What a lovely kaftan.

06:39.873 --> 06:42.106
Well, uh, it's actually yours.

06:42.108 --> 06:43.541
Ahh.

06:43.543 --> 06:45.810
Oh, well,
yes of course.

06:45.812 --> 06:47.811
Uh, I will
get your payment.

06:47.813 --> 06:49.216
No, no, no,
don't get up.

06:50.216 --> 06:51.685
It's free of charge.

06:52.452 --> 06:54.019
No payment?

06:54.021 --> 06:55.753
That was cheap.

06:55.755 --> 06:57.388
Do you want to trade
with something else?

06:57.390 --> 06:58.989
No.

06:58.991 --> 07:02.928
But I can offer to sew all your
clothes completely free of charge,

07:02.930 --> 07:05.029
if you would care
for the goat?

07:05.031 --> 07:07.164
Oh, uh, I understand.

07:07.166 --> 07:10.868
Well, I do not have many
customers in the store anymore,

07:10.870 --> 07:13.371
so, one more goat,
more or less.

07:13.373 --> 07:16.575
Yes, and the boy
can go and travel.

07:16.577 --> 07:20.277
Sorry, I couldn't help
overhearing your talk.

07:20.279 --> 07:24.181
Well, yes, yes, I mean,
we are neighbors, so...

07:25.819 --> 07:26.717
Oh, no.

07:26.719 --> 07:28.587
We've talked about all that,
him and I.

07:28.589 --> 07:29.887
And I've decided.

07:29.889 --> 07:32.556
He is going to be his
father's apprentice tailor.

07:32.558 --> 07:34.758
All that nonsense about
wanting to see the world,

07:34.760 --> 07:36.294
he'll forget about that.

07:36.296 --> 07:39.263
Well, I'm not
too sure about that.

07:39.265 --> 07:40.431
Good evening.

07:40.433 --> 07:42.135
And thanks for helping
with the goat.

07:42.536 --> 07:43.767
We'll see.

07:45.005 --> 07:46.707
Huh? Uh-oh.

07:53.512 --> 07:55.546
I have to help that boy.

07:55.548 --> 07:58.986
So, he can
fulfill his wish.

07:59.586 --> 08:01.656
If only I could.

08:12.432 --> 08:14.099
Good morning, son.

08:14.101 --> 08:15.233
Rise and shine.

08:15.235 --> 08:16.935
Today is the big day.

08:18.171 --> 08:19.203
Big day?

08:19.205 --> 08:22.806
Yes. You are officially
a tailor's apprentice.

08:22.808 --> 08:25.243
El Faza has offered
to take care of the goat.

08:25.245 --> 08:27.878
Later, you can take over
your father's business.

08:27.880 --> 08:29.948
And now that
I have an apprentice,

08:29.950 --> 08:33.318
I can call myself
a master tailor.

08:33.320 --> 08:34.519
What do you say?

08:34.520 --> 08:36.919
You're not listening
to anything I say, Dad.

08:36.922 --> 08:40.524
I wanna go on an adventure
and see the world.

08:40.525 --> 08:44.062
Hodja, the big wide world
is not a nice place.

08:44.063 --> 08:45.630
- So there.
- How would you know?

08:45.632 --> 08:48.232
- Have you seen it?
- I have...

08:48.234 --> 08:50.300
not. But I've read...

08:50.302 --> 08:53.138
Dad. I don't want
to be a tailor.

08:53.140 --> 08:54.505
Ugh. Come on, Raya.

09:06.152 --> 09:07.754
Ugh.

09:10.456 --> 09:12.158
Oh, Raya.

09:13.826 --> 09:15.629
What would I do
without you?

09:17.263 --> 09:18.999
Who's the cutest
goat in the world?

09:19.266 --> 09:20.564
Aww.

09:20.566 --> 09:22.433
You're the cutest goat in the world.

09:22.435 --> 09:24.369
What's up, my boy?

09:24.371 --> 09:26.504
Did someone eat
your baklava?

09:26.506 --> 09:27.875
No.

09:28.908 --> 09:31.543
It's my dad.
He won't let me travel.

09:31.545 --> 09:33.611
He's always
so careful.

09:33.613 --> 09:36.050
I just wanna
see the world.

09:36.616 --> 09:38.582
But I don't know how.

09:38.584 --> 09:39.583
You don't?

09:39.585 --> 09:41.351
I can't walk
to the end of the world.

09:41.353 --> 09:45.490
So unless I learn to grow
wheels or a pair of wings,

09:45.492 --> 09:46.890
I can forget all about it.

09:46.892 --> 09:49.829
Ah, maybe
I can help you.

09:50.530 --> 09:52.233
Come with me,
my boy.

09:53.967 --> 09:54.935
Huh?

09:56.703 --> 09:58.706
Ahh.

09:59.839 --> 10:03.173
I know it's
here somewhere.

10:03.175 --> 10:06.577
I remember everything
except where I put it.

10:06.579 --> 10:07.448
Wow.

10:09.483 --> 10:11.452
Oh, let's see.

10:12.285 --> 10:14.184
No, that's not it either.

10:20.392 --> 10:22.296
Oh,
you old fool.

10:23.396 --> 10:24.998
Where did I put it?

10:30.570 --> 10:31.805
What was that?

10:32.472 --> 10:33.708
Raya, look!

10:36.343 --> 10:39.246
Teprac... erehw era uoy?

10:43.517 --> 10:44.548
It...

10:44.550 --> 10:45.820
It's alive.

10:49.488 --> 10:52.590
Well, that's one way
of putting it.

10:52.592 --> 10:54.659
The important thing
is it can fly.

10:54.661 --> 10:56.863
It's a flying carpet?

10:57.329 --> 10:59.364
Whoa!

10:59.366 --> 11:00.798
Can I try it?

11:00.800 --> 11:02.733
You can't just
try it, my boy.

11:02.735 --> 11:04.202
You can borrow it.

11:04.204 --> 11:05.837
Borrow the carpet?

11:05.839 --> 11:07.539
Yes, exactly.

11:07.541 --> 11:11.478
You can borrow the carpet,
Hodja, if you could...

11:12.378 --> 11:13.477
No.

11:13.479 --> 11:14.913
I cannot
ask you that.

11:14.915 --> 11:16.481
Please, please, anything.

11:16.483 --> 11:17.915
It might be
too dangerous.

11:17.917 --> 11:20.751
"Dangerous"?
Just ask, you got it.

11:20.753 --> 11:22.053
Okay.

11:22.055 --> 11:25.291
Will you fly to Petto
and try to find my Diamond?

11:25.825 --> 11:27.292
Eh, Petto?

11:27.294 --> 11:28.726
- Mmm-hmm.
- Diamond?

11:28.728 --> 11:31.895
Uh, you lost me there
a little bit.

11:31.897 --> 11:34.399
Petto is the Sultan City.

11:34.401 --> 11:36.634
It's a wonderful place.

11:36.636 --> 11:39.537
The palace has domes
covered in gold.

11:39.539 --> 11:44.042
Unfortunately, I had to escape
from there without my Diamond.

11:44.044 --> 11:46.845
Oh, I miss her
so terribly.

11:46.847 --> 11:48.212
Eh, "her"?

11:48.214 --> 11:49.282
Yes.

11:49.916 --> 11:51.381
Uh, sorry, uh...

11:51.383 --> 11:52.917
That's my granddaughter.

11:52.919 --> 11:55.389
A wonderful little girl.

11:56.156 --> 11:58.555
I had to flee
without her.

11:58.557 --> 12:00.290
The Sultan
was after me.

12:00.292 --> 12:02.760
He wanted to throw me
to the crocodiles.

12:02.762 --> 12:04.228
Crocodiles?

12:04.230 --> 12:04.996
Why?

12:04.998 --> 12:06.865
He wanted
to steal my carpet.

12:06.867 --> 12:09.701
He was completely obsessed
with the idea of flying.

12:09.703 --> 12:11.970
The easiest way
was to get rid of me.

12:11.972 --> 12:13.704
What a total jerk!

12:13.706 --> 12:16.476
I tried many times
to retrieve my Diamond,

12:17.676 --> 12:19.611
but no luck.

12:19.613 --> 12:22.179
Now I'm too old to travel.

12:22.181 --> 12:25.286
But you are so young
and healthy.

12:25.719 --> 12:27.253
You could do it.

12:27.887 --> 12:29.355
Will you do it for me?

12:30.089 --> 12:31.157
Will you?

12:31.858 --> 12:34.058
Would I do it?
Would I do it?

12:34.060 --> 12:35.525
Of course, I would.

12:35.527 --> 12:37.095
I'm off to see
the world!

12:37.097 --> 12:38.496
I'm off to see
the world!

12:38.498 --> 12:41.499
And I'm gonna see the world
from a flying carpet.

12:45.638 --> 12:48.305
But, it might get dangerous.

12:48.307 --> 12:50.808
You must promise me
to take good care of yourself.

12:50.810 --> 12:52.076
I promise.

12:52.078 --> 12:52.843
But...

12:52.845 --> 12:54.846
How do you
control the carpet?

12:54.848 --> 12:57.081
It takes a little practice,
you know,

12:57.083 --> 13:00.717
because the carpet has
its very own personality.

13:00.719 --> 13:02.720
You can't just
walk all over it.

13:02.722 --> 13:04.087
But, how then?

13:04.089 --> 13:05.756
You...

13:05.758 --> 13:08.159
You just have to do
everything backwards.

13:08.161 --> 13:10.662
- Backwards?
- Yes, exactly.

13:10.664 --> 13:11.663
Backwards.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.997
You're a smart kid.

13:13.999 --> 13:15.632
Yeah, come on.

13:15.634 --> 13:17.235
Come with me, Raya.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.741
It's okay.
I'll manage it.

13:23.743 --> 13:25.278
That's good, my boy.

13:28.647 --> 13:30.350
I trust you!

13:32.118 --> 13:34.419
- Hello there, Mom. I'm back.
- Ah, Hodja.

13:34.421 --> 13:35.355
- Hello.
- Hi, Dad.

13:35.955 --> 13:38.255
So, are you ready?

13:38.257 --> 13:39.823
Sure, I'm ready.

13:39.825 --> 13:41.558
I'm ready
to go to Petto.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.361
The city of the Sultan.

13:43.363 --> 13:44.598
- To Petto?
- Yes.

13:46.366 --> 13:47.497
How exciting.

13:47.499 --> 13:50.000
It's a thousand miles away,
you know.

13:50.002 --> 13:52.770
And how exactly did
you plan to get there?

13:52.772 --> 13:54.642
Well, I'm just gonna fly.

13:55.474 --> 13:56.343
That's how.

13:57.676 --> 13:59.476
Fly?

13:59.478 --> 14:03.280
Hear that, Jamila? Now the boy
really has lost his falafels.

14:03.282 --> 14:04.615
Let's just hear
what he has to say.

14:04.617 --> 14:06.918
- You see, I was just...
- No, no. Don't say anything.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.052
Let me guess.

14:08.054 --> 14:09.920
You have sewn
a hot air balloon.

14:09.922 --> 14:12.023
Oh, no, wait.
You can't sew.

14:12.025 --> 14:13.591
No. You've trained
a bunch of bats.

14:13.593 --> 14:16.727
Hmm, better yet, an eagle.
Yes, that's better.

14:16.729 --> 14:20.130
You have trained an eagle that
has now become quite tame

14:20.132 --> 14:22.100
and has promised
to fly you to Petto

14:22.102 --> 14:25.870
while juggling oranges and
singing the national anthem.

14:25.872 --> 14:27.704
Well, close, Dad.

14:27.706 --> 14:29.640
I'm going on
a flying carpet.

14:29.642 --> 14:31.174
A flying carpet?

14:31.176 --> 14:32.909
Poor me.

14:32.911 --> 14:35.480
My only son has gone
completely crazy.

14:35.482 --> 14:39.317
Totally cuckoo. Round the bend.
Soft in the shawarma.

14:39.319 --> 14:42.486
Flipped his fez.
Lights on, nobody's home.

14:42.488 --> 14:44.054
Just stop it, Aram.

14:44.056 --> 14:45.957
Oh, you're
part of it too.

14:45.959 --> 14:47.424
Oh, I see.

14:47.426 --> 14:51.062
Oh yes. Okay, now that my whole
family has screws loose,

14:51.064 --> 14:52.663
I won't stand in the way.

14:52.665 --> 14:54.265
No. Okay.

14:54.267 --> 14:57.467
- If you can prove that you can fly that rug...
- Mmm-hmm.

14:57.469 --> 14:58.535
As far as I'm concerned,

14:58.537 --> 15:00.670
you can fly off
wherever you want to.

15:00.672 --> 15:02.406
Yeah, even the moon.

15:02.408 --> 15:03.241
But,

15:03.243 --> 15:04.976
if anything
doesn't take off,

15:04.978 --> 15:07.311
you're gonna be
a tailor's apprentice.

15:07.313 --> 15:09.383
- Is that a deal?
- It's a deal.

15:14.320 --> 15:15.189
Hmm.

15:15.488 --> 15:16.357
Hmm.

15:20.292 --> 15:24.194
Hmm. Which is the front and
which is the back of a carpet?

15:24.196 --> 15:25.896
Both ends
look the same.

15:25.898 --> 15:28.566
It's not easy
to turn it backwards.

15:28.568 --> 15:32.102
Mmm, l-l-let's give
this end a shot.

15:35.007 --> 15:36.676
Fly, carpet.

15:45.852 --> 15:47.387
Fly, carpet.

15:47.753 --> 15:49.123
Fly, carpet.

15:50.723 --> 15:51.688
Fly.

15:55.661 --> 15:56.861
Fly, carpet.

15:56.863 --> 15:58.395
Oh, fly already.

15:58.397 --> 16:00.430
What's wrong with you?

16:00.432 --> 16:01.667
Fly.

16:04.536 --> 16:06.404
Oh, it's not working!

16:06.406 --> 16:09.073
What did El Faza
mean by backwards?

16:09.075 --> 16:10.574
Should the carpet
be reversed?

16:10.576 --> 16:12.876
Or...
Oh, what's happening?

16:17.182 --> 16:19.917
Raya, what're you doing?

16:19.919 --> 16:21.785
You're trying
to tell me something?

16:21.787 --> 16:23.621
You're saying...

16:29.528 --> 16:30.995
Bleat backwards?

16:30.997 --> 16:33.664
And you're
walking backwards.

16:33.666 --> 16:34.899
You, eh...

16:34.901 --> 16:37.501
Hmm.

16:37.503 --> 16:41.072
Oh, you want me
to talk backwards.

16:41.074 --> 16:44.342
I'll try talking backwards.
That's a good idea.

16:44.344 --> 16:46.280
A really
good idea, Raya.

16:47.180 --> 16:50.581
So, "fly carpet"
becomes,

16:50.583 --> 16:54.221
becomes...
"Fly carpet" becomes...

16:54.586 --> 16:56.289
Ylf, teprac!

17:04.063 --> 17:05.398
Huh?

17:06.031 --> 17:07.964
Oh, excuse me.

17:07.967 --> 17:09.367
Excuse me, sweet carpet.

17:09.368 --> 17:11.835
I was being
a little too aggressive.

17:11.837 --> 17:13.205
I'll try again.

17:13.605 --> 17:16.373
Ylf, teprac.

17:26.786 --> 17:28.852
It worked!
It worked!

17:28.854 --> 17:30.388
Raya, you're a genius.

17:30.390 --> 17:32.756
Look, El Faza,
I've mastered it.

17:32.758 --> 17:34.891
I'm the champion in backward speaking.

17:34.893 --> 17:36.360
That's great, Hodja.

17:36.362 --> 17:38.196
But how
do I find Petto?

17:38.198 --> 17:40.531
Well...

17:40.533 --> 17:43.066
You'll just have to, um...
Oh, uh,

17:43.068 --> 17:45.169
let the carpet
find the way,

17:45.171 --> 17:47.572
and fly to the sun.

17:47.574 --> 17:49.739
I'll find your Diamond.
I promise.

17:49.741 --> 17:51.242
That's good, my boy.

17:51.244 --> 17:53.247
Just trust the carpet.

17:58.718 --> 18:00.117
Bye, Dad.

18:00.119 --> 18:01.686
I'm gonna go to Petto.

18:01.688 --> 18:02.786
Uh...

18:02.788 --> 18:03.920
But...

18:03.922 --> 18:05.121
Goodbye, son.

18:05.123 --> 18:06.056
Goodbye, Mom.

18:06.058 --> 18:07.358
Do you really
wanna go?

18:07.360 --> 18:09.360
Don't worry.
I'll be back.

18:09.362 --> 18:12.095
Well, he has earned
the right to go.

18:12.097 --> 18:13.166
But...

18:13.632 --> 18:15.099
Oh.

18:15.101 --> 18:16.536
Take care now,
my darling.

18:20.472 --> 18:21.906
And what
about you, Raya?

18:21.908 --> 18:22.910
Are you ready?

18:24.509 --> 18:28.181
So, now, everybody,
ready for departure!

18:38.591 --> 18:40.727
Whoa!

18:44.063 --> 18:45.496
Whoa! Whoa!

18:45.498 --> 18:47.430
Whoa!

18:52.738 --> 18:53.840
Look, Raya.

19:02.649 --> 19:03.850
Oh!

19:40.687 --> 19:41.755
Whoa!

19:54.400 --> 19:55.701
Enjoy!

20:10.482 --> 20:11.350
Oh.

20:15.955 --> 20:16.857
Hey!

20:40.747 --> 20:41.848
Wow!

20:43.982 --> 20:45.716
Domes of gold!

20:45.718 --> 20:47.150
Wow!

20:47.152 --> 20:48.954
Oh, that must be Petto.

21:05.805 --> 21:06.907
Wow.

21:11.811 --> 21:13.009
Come on, Raya.

21:17.216 --> 21:18.485
Wow.

21:22.488 --> 21:24.955
It's exactly like
in my dream, Raya.

21:26.124 --> 21:27.361
What're you looking at?

21:29.796 --> 21:31.328
Huh.

21:31.330 --> 21:33.363
Watch where
you're going.

21:33.365 --> 21:35.134
Get out of here,
little boy.

21:37.269 --> 21:39.169
Get out of here.

21:39.171 --> 21:42.739
It's exactly like in my dream
but just completely different.

21:43.976 --> 21:45.208
Stop! Thief!

21:45.210 --> 21:46.243
Huh?

21:48.514 --> 21:49.546
Get back here.

21:49.548 --> 21:50.880
Oh, come on, move!

21:50.882 --> 21:53.883
I gotta get to the palace
with the Sultan's pigeons.

21:53.885 --> 21:56.486
If he doesn't get his
pigeon tongues tonight,

21:56.488 --> 21:58.922
then I will definitely be
crocodile food.

21:58.924 --> 22:01.124
Oh, hello.

22:01.126 --> 22:02.258
Hello, pretty birds.

22:02.260 --> 22:04.428
Hey. What're you
doing, kid? Huh?

22:04.430 --> 22:07.031
No. I just wanted to say
hi to the pigeons.

22:07.033 --> 22:09.233
"Just wanted to say
hi to the pigeons"?

22:09.235 --> 22:10.467
No.

22:10.469 --> 22:12.870
You wanted to steal
as many as you could

22:12.872 --> 22:16.806
and then call on all your dirty,
hungry street friends, right?

22:16.808 --> 22:20.046
Have a regular feast
at the Sultan's expense.

22:20.813 --> 22:21.544
Huh?

22:21.546 --> 22:22.713
- Oh, would we?
- Ha!

22:22.715 --> 22:24.715
I see.
So, you admit it.

22:24.717 --> 22:27.485
Well, then it's you that'll be
fed to the crocodiles.

22:27.487 --> 22:29.320
Guard, I've caught a thief!

22:29.322 --> 22:30.854
Get over here! Quickly!

22:30.856 --> 22:31.921
But I... But I...

22:31.923 --> 22:34.891
Typical. No one around
when you want one.

22:34.893 --> 22:36.960
Whoa! Look at that.

22:36.962 --> 22:39.229
You know what, you might just
be able to save yourself

22:39.231 --> 22:40.663
by giving me
that carpet there.

22:40.665 --> 22:42.533
Yeah, everything's
under control.

22:42.535 --> 22:44.534
It was just
a misunderstanding.

22:44.536 --> 22:47.470
Just the very thing my wife
has been looking for.

22:47.472 --> 22:49.473
Luckily for you, my friend,

22:49.475 --> 22:51.041
you're gonna get off lightly.

22:51.043 --> 22:52.509
No, no, no, let it go.

22:52.511 --> 22:54.344
Let it go.
It's not my carpet.

22:54.346 --> 22:56.412
Ah, so you stole that too.

22:56.414 --> 22:58.983
Well, game over, buddy,
let go of the carpet.

22:58.985 --> 23:01.351
No, no, no,
I've not stolen anything.

23:01.353 --> 23:04.790
I-I-I've borrowed it. I borrowed
it so I could fly here.

23:05.892 --> 23:07.490
Huh? Fly?

23:09.895 --> 23:12.630
If that's a flying carpet,
you know what you should do?

23:12.632 --> 23:14.631
Give it to the Sultan.

23:14.633 --> 23:17.700
He'll make you the General
of the entire army.

23:19.271 --> 23:20.336
- Follow me.
- Huh?

23:26.178 --> 23:27.878
What were you thinking?

23:27.880 --> 23:30.714
You do not put your hands
near the Sultan's pigeons.

23:30.716 --> 23:32.882
How stupid can you be?

23:32.884 --> 23:34.985
Are you trying
to lose your hands?

23:34.987 --> 23:36.320
Use your head.

23:36.322 --> 23:37.720
Don't you know
it's a death penalty

23:37.722 --> 23:40.323
for touching the Sultan's
pigeons, country bumpkin?

23:40.325 --> 23:42.560
Huh... Eh, no!

23:42.562 --> 23:45.295
Okay. So you're
not from the city.

23:45.297 --> 23:49.803
No. I come from a small village
called Pjort, far away from here.

23:50.902 --> 23:52.002
But...

23:52.004 --> 23:53.370
- like how?
- "How"?

23:53.372 --> 23:55.471
I flew here on my carpet.

23:55.473 --> 23:56.674
- Flew?
- Yeah.

23:56.676 --> 23:59.275
Ding dong.
Is there anyone home?

23:59.277 --> 24:01.111
Cuckoo factory.

24:01.113 --> 24:04.448
Listen, if that's a flying
carpet, then this is a pyramid.

24:04.450 --> 24:06.784
Hmm, well then it
must hurt to sit down.

24:06.786 --> 24:09.352
Ha-ha. You're cheeky.

24:09.354 --> 24:10.656
You owe me something.

24:10.957 --> 24:12.055
I do?

24:12.057 --> 24:12.924
Yes, you do.

24:12.926 --> 24:15.458
Ugh. I saved your life,
you nitwit.

24:15.460 --> 24:16.893
But I thought you
wanted to help me.

24:16.895 --> 24:18.329
Help? Please.

24:18.331 --> 24:21.265
Do I look like the ambassador
for homeless children?

24:21.267 --> 24:23.434
Here, it's nothing
for nothing.

24:23.436 --> 24:25.569
- Huh. Give me that old rug.
- Whoa!

24:25.571 --> 24:27.771
- No, no, I can't. It's not mine.
- Yeah, yeah.

24:27.773 --> 24:29.840
- -I saw the
little girl thief over there.

24:29.842 --> 24:31.842
- Quick, this way.
- Now we have her.

24:31.844 --> 24:33.776
They ran that way, huh?

24:33.778 --> 24:35.312
Where'd they go?

24:37.016 --> 24:38.017
In here.

24:50.997 --> 24:52.062
You live here?

24:52.064 --> 24:53.700
Yeah. Keep going.

24:56.001 --> 24:58.168
- What's your name, by the way?
- Hodja.

24:58.170 --> 24:59.902
- Mine's Emerald.
- Nice to meet you.

24:59.904 --> 25:01.705
And my goat's called Raya.

25:01.707 --> 25:03.343
Cute goat.

25:04.110 --> 25:05.775
- Ouch!
- Hey.

25:05.777 --> 25:06.912
- What's up?
- Huh?

25:07.779 --> 25:09.246
Oh.

25:09.248 --> 25:10.613
Where do you
think you're at?

25:10.615 --> 25:13.219
The Rat goes nuts if
we bring strangers home.

25:17.590 --> 25:19.255
Hide him.
The Rat is coming.

25:19.257 --> 25:20.192
Go.

25:29.834 --> 25:33.006
Well, what has my little
guinea fowl brought me today?

25:35.940 --> 25:39.176
Oh, do my eyes
deceive me?

25:39.178 --> 25:41.011
Finally, I'm rich.

25:41.013 --> 25:42.816
Rich!

25:54.192 --> 25:56.060
Stale bread?

25:56.062 --> 25:59.362
Aww, my own
little golden sparrow.

25:59.364 --> 26:01.867
You know
I love stale bread.

26:03.501 --> 26:05.235
Okay, so let me
get this right.

26:05.237 --> 26:08.371
You children seem to believe that
shelter is free, am I right?

26:08.373 --> 26:12.676
That you are poor street urchins
who are entitled to a home.

26:12.678 --> 26:15.012
But you're wrong.

26:15.014 --> 26:18.082
That ship sailed when your parents
threw you into the trash.

26:18.084 --> 26:21.017
So if you don't hurry up and
find out where your talents lie,

26:21.019 --> 26:23.757
then I know a gutter
with your name on it.

26:25.924 --> 26:27.159
Ah!

26:28.526 --> 26:31.762
That's better. Shall we continue
the progress, young lady?

26:31.764 --> 26:36.036
May one be permitted to ask what
delicacies you hide behind your back?

26:36.535 --> 26:39.205
Or is it a secret?

26:41.606 --> 26:44.009
Let's have
a little look-see, shall we?

26:46.746 --> 26:49.149
- I'll teach you never to...
- Stop!

26:50.048 --> 26:53.583
Well, what
have we here?

26:53.585 --> 26:56.789
The Prince
and his mighty...

26:57.222 --> 26:58.188
Goat.

27:01.594 --> 27:03.196
Ooh, <i>Salaam.</i>

27:03.828 --> 27:06.463
What nice pearly whites.

27:06.465 --> 27:08.198
So, is there more
to see here?

27:08.200 --> 27:11.834
In that case, I think Your Highness
should clear off back to his castle.

27:11.836 --> 27:16.506
Unless you wanna see how I turn this
bag of bones here into a saddlebag.

27:16.508 --> 27:17.908
I got milk.

27:17.910 --> 27:20.143
Delicious goat's milk.

27:20.145 --> 27:21.447
For everybody.

27:28.353 --> 27:29.389
Mmm.

27:31.590 --> 27:32.959
Not bad.

27:34.125 --> 27:35.024
Not bad.

27:35.026 --> 27:37.127
But I don't expect
your gallant milkman

27:37.129 --> 27:40.531
is the only thing you'll present
me with today, little dove.

27:40.533 --> 27:41.901
Hang on.

27:42.334 --> 27:43.766
Huh?

27:43.768 --> 27:45.337
Wait. No, no, no,
that's mine.

27:45.770 --> 27:47.470
A carpet. Yes.

27:47.472 --> 27:49.038
Now the menu is complete.

27:49.040 --> 27:51.307
An old, dusty carpet
as dessert.

27:51.309 --> 27:52.876
How delicious.

27:52.878 --> 27:56.783
Could one be so fortunate as to have
a dirty, stinking sock as a garnish?

27:58.350 --> 27:59.216
And keep it down.

27:59.218 --> 28:01.521
I wanna enjoy
my mutton in peace.

28:04.623 --> 28:06.323
You said
it wasn't yours.

28:06.325 --> 28:07.557
Yes, I know.

28:07.559 --> 28:08.859
But it's one I borrowed.

28:08.861 --> 28:10.593
And it's definitely
not yours.

28:10.595 --> 28:13.630
So, you borrowed
a flying carpet?

28:13.632 --> 28:14.797
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

28:14.799 --> 28:17.935
From whom?
The Caliph of Baghdad?

28:17.937 --> 28:19.570
I don't care
if you believe me.

28:19.572 --> 28:21.103
Uh, you got your milk

28:21.105 --> 28:22.538
and I don't
owe you anymore.

28:22.540 --> 28:25.609
You've never
tasted hunger, have you?

28:25.611 --> 28:26.810
What would you know
about that?

28:26.812 --> 28:27.947
Have you?

28:28.646 --> 28:29.679
No.

28:29.681 --> 28:30.980
Yeah, well, we have.

28:30.982 --> 28:33.382
But why? There's lots
of food everywhere.

28:33.384 --> 28:34.851
Why would you starve?

28:34.853 --> 28:37.621
I'll tell you why. Because that fat
lump of a sultan eats everything,

28:37.623 --> 28:39.355
so we're left with nothing.

28:39.357 --> 28:42.258
But why he can't just share
if he has so much?

28:42.260 --> 28:44.428
Ha! Him? Share?

28:44.430 --> 28:45.562
No. Never.

28:45.564 --> 28:47.496
He just wants
more and more.

28:47.498 --> 28:49.632
You don't get fat
on air alone.

28:49.634 --> 28:52.238
Enough! I want quiet!

28:57.476 --> 28:58.344
Goodnight.

29:04.717 --> 29:08.084
I better get going. There's
something I have to find.

29:08.086 --> 29:10.553
- I hope we meet again.
- Probably, country bumpkin.

29:10.555 --> 29:12.389
- You take care.
- Yeah.

29:12.391 --> 29:13.258
Sure.

29:23.768 --> 29:26.269
We better postpone
our search till tomorrow.

29:26.271 --> 29:27.537
Okay, Raya?

29:27.539 --> 29:31.440
But, first, let's find a better
place to sleep than this.

29:31.442 --> 29:35.111
Hmm, what do you say
we take the penthouse, okay?

29:35.113 --> 29:37.549
As Price and his mighty goat.

29:38.217 --> 29:39.319
Right, Raya?

29:40.385 --> 29:41.520
Hmm?

29:42.554 --> 29:44.290
Ylf, teprac.

29:51.764 --> 29:53.498
Ylf, teprac?

29:55.734 --> 29:57.237
Te-Teprac, ylf?

30:13.719 --> 30:15.587
Goodnight, Raya.

30:18.556 --> 30:19.925
Goodnight, carpet.

30:22.561 --> 30:23.759
Oh, no.

30:23.761 --> 30:26.431
I mean, "Doogthgin, teprac."

30:47.553 --> 30:49.455
Oh, no.
Oh, no. Raya.

30:50.588 --> 30:52.057
Where's the carpet?

30:53.057 --> 30:54.791
It must be that Emerald
who's taken it.

30:54.793 --> 30:59.463
She already took it at that
house and gave it to that nasty man.

30:59.465 --> 31:00.400
Come on, Raya.

31:15.213 --> 31:18.215
Hey, buddy, you can't just
barge into the Sultan's palace.

31:18.217 --> 31:19.953
You think we were
born yesterday?

31:20.853 --> 31:23.285
No, n-no. But, but...

31:23.287 --> 31:24.688
But what?

31:24.690 --> 31:28.091
I hope I don't flatter myself to
say that I have something here

31:28.093 --> 31:29.793
that our all-loving father,

31:29.795 --> 31:33.030
the brother of the moon
and the sun, our great father,

31:33.032 --> 31:35.998
our most righteous,
all powerful and...

31:36.000 --> 31:37.967
Shut up
and cut to the chase.

31:37.969 --> 31:42.238
I've something here our honorable Sultan
has desired for a very long time.

31:42.240 --> 31:43.806
And what would
that be?

31:43.808 --> 31:45.677
His Greatness
has everything.

31:47.912 --> 31:49.880
Oh yeah.

31:49.882 --> 31:51.948
A moth-eaten old carpet.

31:51.950 --> 31:54.950
Yeah, he doesn't
have one of them.

31:54.952 --> 31:56.388
You're right there, buddy.

31:57.422 --> 31:58.621
How funny.

31:58.623 --> 32:01.291
Y-You're a very
funny man.

32:01.293 --> 32:02.225
Yes.

32:02.227 --> 32:03.259
And very handsome too.

32:03.261 --> 32:05.161
Spare us the waffle,
old timer.

32:05.163 --> 32:07.630
And while you're at it, you
can take your moldy old rag

32:07.632 --> 32:10.900
and crawl back into the
hole you crawled out of.

32:10.902 --> 32:13.703
What? But, but, but, but,
it can fly.

32:13.705 --> 32:17.210
Fly?
You hear that? Get out of here.

32:18.709 --> 32:20.544
The gentleman may not be aware

32:20.546 --> 32:25.181
that the one who brings the flying
carpet to our dearly beloved Sultan,

32:25.183 --> 32:27.551
will become
the new General

32:27.553 --> 32:29.919
of the entire army.

32:29.921 --> 32:33.558
Such a carpet is
the Sultan's highest wish.

32:34.426 --> 32:36.293
Well, uh, uh...

32:36.295 --> 32:38.562
You know, the Sultan
really wants a flying carpet.

32:38.564 --> 32:40.831
It's like number one
on his wish list.

32:40.833 --> 32:42.565
Yeah, of course
I know that.

32:42.567 --> 32:44.133
So, if,

32:44.135 --> 32:46.902
if it really is a flying carpet,

32:46.904 --> 32:51.174
and the Sultan hears that we
prevented it from entering,

32:51.176 --> 32:53.342
then we'll be
up the creek.

32:53.344 --> 32:56.446
Uh, no, I think we'll be
thrown to the crocodiles.

32:56.448 --> 32:59.515
But up a creek sounds
like much more fun.

32:59.517 --> 33:00.917
You idiot!

33:00.919 --> 33:02.451
Let's just let him in.

33:02.453 --> 33:05.621
And if the carpet
doesn't fly,

33:05.623 --> 33:08.691
he's the one who gets
to swim with the crocodiles,

33:08.693 --> 33:10.462
not us.

33:10.728 --> 33:11.761
Okay.

33:11.763 --> 33:13.433
- Right this way, sir.
- Right this way, sir.

33:13.832 --> 33:15.599
Gentlemen.

33:17.169 --> 33:20.336
Not doing so well
seeing the big world, Raya.

33:20.338 --> 33:22.107
Maybe my dad was right.

33:26.010 --> 33:27.910
I know he can be a bit strict,

33:27.912 --> 33:29.478
but I miss him anyway.

33:29.480 --> 33:33.015
And now I can't go home
because I've lost the carpet.

33:33.017 --> 33:35.287
And I haven't found
Diamond either.

33:36.854 --> 33:39.488
I need to find Emerald
if I'm to find the carpet.

33:39.490 --> 33:42.360
But I'll probably
never see her again.

33:44.363 --> 33:46.263
Excuse me, excuse me.

33:46.265 --> 33:49.032
Do you happen to know
a girl called Emerald?

33:49.034 --> 33:50.967
She's like,
she has black hair.

33:50.969 --> 33:55.639
Oh, well, I know about 30
black-haired girls called Emerald.

33:55.641 --> 33:57.276
So, good luck with that.

34:00.077 --> 34:01.314
Stop! Thief!

34:02.381 --> 34:03.813
Emerald.

34:07.619 --> 34:09.485
Stop!

34:09.487 --> 34:12.821
Thief? Thief.
Yeah, she sure is.

34:12.822 --> 34:14.226
I know
you took it.

34:15.293 --> 34:16.696
Come back here.

34:17.962 --> 34:19.129
Let's go.

34:24.870 --> 34:25.770
Now.

34:26.737 --> 34:27.772
Whee!

34:38.884 --> 34:40.083
Come on, you idiot.

34:40.085 --> 34:41.687
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

34:42.788 --> 34:44.487
Ugh, not again.

34:44.489 --> 34:46.225
They'll never
catch them anyway.

35:01.038 --> 35:02.542
Whoa, watch out, kid.

35:07.546 --> 35:08.714
Aha!

35:11.616 --> 35:12.651
Up here, Raya.

35:20.792 --> 35:22.460
Hmm.

35:37.843 --> 35:38.911
Here you go.

35:48.252 --> 35:49.854
Quick. Grab my hand.

36:04.502 --> 36:06.736
Oh, she's gone again.

36:06.738 --> 36:09.806
Ugh, things move
really fast in the big city.

36:09.808 --> 36:11.207
Right, Raya?

36:13.745 --> 36:15.348
What's up, bumpkin?

36:16.948 --> 36:18.047
Give me back my carpet.

36:18.049 --> 36:20.616
Do I look like someone
who carries carpets around?

36:20.618 --> 36:22.217
Do you think
I selll rugs?

36:22.219 --> 36:25.321
Now what use would
I have for an old carpet?

36:25.323 --> 36:28.792
You stole it. You're a thief.

36:28.794 --> 36:33.228
Well, say that again and
I'll turn your mug into a <i>durum</i> roll.

36:33.230 --> 36:34.698
I'm not a thief.

36:34.700 --> 36:37.199
I borrow from those who have too much.
Get it?

36:37.201 --> 36:38.567
And that's
just how it is.

36:38.569 --> 36:41.971
So I did not steal
your stupid old carpet.

36:41.973 --> 36:43.276
Have fun.

36:44.142 --> 36:45.011
But...

36:47.044 --> 36:48.310
I'm sorry.

36:48.312 --> 36:49.446
I didn't mean it like that.

36:49.448 --> 36:51.580
- It's just that...
- "It's just that," what?

36:51.582 --> 36:55.984
That somebody has stolen it and you're one
of the few who know it's a flying carpet.

36:55.986 --> 36:57.687
Uh, I don't
really know that.

36:57.689 --> 36:59.989
It's just something
you claim.

36:59.991 --> 37:01.690
I haven't
seen it take off.

37:01.692 --> 37:04.493
Until I see that,
it's just an old rag to me.

37:04.495 --> 37:05.631
Huh?

37:06.665 --> 37:08.063
Ow!

37:08.065 --> 37:09.899
Will you please
help me?

37:09.901 --> 37:12.034
Me? Help you?

37:12.036 --> 37:13.103
Yeah.

37:13.105 --> 37:14.103
Yeah.

37:14.105 --> 37:16.272
Why is that so weird?

37:16.274 --> 37:19.078
Well, no one's ever
asked me that before.

37:20.678 --> 37:22.414
No one? But...

37:23.047 --> 37:24.549
Will you?

37:25.149 --> 37:26.352
Hmm, yes.

37:26.785 --> 37:28.585
I'd be happy to.

37:28.587 --> 37:31.687
- I guess you have to try something new sometimes.
- Yeah.

37:31.689 --> 37:33.422
I can't go home
without the carpet

37:33.424 --> 37:35.091
and I also
need to find Diamond.

37:35.093 --> 37:37.226
A diamond? Of course.
Easy-peasy.

37:37.228 --> 37:39.062
I happen to have
seven here in my pocket.

37:39.064 --> 37:40.029
What size
do you want?

37:41.632 --> 37:42.498
Whoa!

37:42.500 --> 37:44.500
Not that
kind of diamond.

37:44.502 --> 37:46.703
I mean,
it's a little girl.

37:46.705 --> 37:49.505
A little girl?
That's even worse.

37:49.507 --> 37:52.308
- Okay, let's try and find the carpet first.
- Good idea.

37:52.310 --> 37:54.377
I just don't know
where to start.

37:54.379 --> 37:55.547
Huh?

37:56.781 --> 37:59.315
Smart goat
you got there.

37:59.317 --> 38:01.016
Yeah, that's The Rat.

38:01.018 --> 38:02.685
100%.

38:02.687 --> 38:03.788
The Rat?

38:04.989 --> 38:07.056
Soon, I will be General.

38:07.058 --> 38:08.824
More food. Now.

38:08.826 --> 38:10.859
Otherwise you'll all
be thrown to the crocodiles.

38:10.861 --> 38:14.531
Yes, that means
someone will be sent today.

38:14.533 --> 38:16.966
Oh, oh,
that doesn't bode well.

38:16.968 --> 38:19.669
The Sultan's always
extra grumpy when he's hungry.

38:19.671 --> 38:21.373
And he's always hungry!

38:33.250 --> 38:37.487
What kind of dried-up little prune
of a man is that before me?

38:37.489 --> 38:38.924
I can't eat him.

38:39.591 --> 38:41.594
Oh, such shoddy service.

38:42.694 --> 38:44.828
Ahh!

38:44.830 --> 38:46.161
My favorite dish.

38:46.163 --> 38:47.996
Slow-roast pigeon tongue.

38:56.241 --> 38:58.107
Highest Sultan,

38:58.109 --> 38:59.842
your reverence.

38:59.844 --> 39:03.513
May you
and your countless wives

39:03.515 --> 39:06.415
live full and blissful lives.

39:06.417 --> 39:09.284
As the sun
crosses the sky,

39:09.286 --> 39:11.687
and moon shines...

39:12.623 --> 39:14.056
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, fine.

39:15.361 --> 39:20.129
I have been told you have a
particular wish, Your Highness,

39:20.131 --> 39:21.667
a dream.

39:22.399 --> 39:24.102
I have a dream?

39:24.969 --> 39:26.502
A dream of

39:26.504 --> 39:28.737
being able to fly.

39:28.739 --> 39:29.607
Huh?

39:32.410 --> 39:34.013
More. More.

39:38.984 --> 39:43.453
And I was led to believe
that Your Greatness

39:43.455 --> 39:45.221
plans to make General,

39:45.223 --> 39:47.824
he who brings
to you

39:47.826 --> 39:49.528
a flying carpet.

39:52.330 --> 39:53.532
That's right.

39:54.866 --> 39:57.000
I believe if you
receive a flying carpet,

39:57.002 --> 39:58.701
you have to give
something in return.

39:58.703 --> 40:01.770
I mean,
I'm not unreasonable.

40:01.772 --> 40:03.973
Even though
I can do whatever I want.

40:03.975 --> 40:07.442
But, there isn't much
buoyancy in that moldy rag.

40:07.444 --> 40:09.515
Remember, I'm a big man.

40:10.047 --> 40:11.181
Yes, I am.

40:11.183 --> 40:14.484
And uh, so now, I think
I'll eat my breakfast in peace.

40:14.486 --> 40:17.987
Afterwards, we'll see if that old
rag can lift itself off the ground.

40:17.989 --> 40:19.656
Now go away.

40:19.658 --> 40:21.627
My mouth's watering.

40:23.361 --> 40:25.230
Just like my crocodiles.

40:27.098 --> 40:28.964
Just so you know.

40:30.035 --> 40:31.737
More food!

40:38.810 --> 40:41.344
No, Hodja.
He is camel dung.

40:41.346 --> 40:43.114
He'll never
return the carpet.

40:44.248 --> 40:45.582
Even if we ask nicely?

40:45.584 --> 40:47.482
Ask nicely?

40:47.484 --> 40:49.351
Perhaps it's like that
where you come from.

40:49.353 --> 40:50.587
But not here in Petto.

40:50.589 --> 40:52.455
It's everyone
for himself.

40:53.825 --> 40:57.663
Sorry. That's just how
the pita is baked, bumpkin.

40:57.995 --> 40:58.962
But,

40:58.964 --> 41:01.663
don't you know
anyone who would help?

41:01.665 --> 41:03.366
Uh, there is
one lady.

41:03.368 --> 41:04.701
Her name's Gemstone.

41:04.703 --> 41:07.971
She's pretty cool.
Maybe she'll help.

41:07.973 --> 41:10.806
I said maybe. I wouldn't put my
fingers in the chopping block for it.

41:10.808 --> 41:12.975
- That's better than nothing.
- Whoa.

41:12.977 --> 41:14.076
Let's try.

41:14.078 --> 41:14.946
Sure.

41:20.819 --> 41:23.118
- Not far to go.
- Great.

41:23.120 --> 41:25.654
So, this is where
the coppersmiths work.

41:25.656 --> 41:27.058
- Wow.
- Pretty cool, huh?

41:27.392 --> 41:28.725
Yeah.

41:28.727 --> 41:30.629
And this is where
Gemstone lives.

41:32.596 --> 41:34.364
Hey, look,
there she is.

41:34.366 --> 41:38.567
They also say that His Corpulence,
our flabby whale of a Sultan,

41:38.569 --> 41:40.335
had his greatest wish
come true.

41:40.337 --> 41:42.105
Uh-huh.
And what was his wish?

41:42.107 --> 41:45.408
Well, our
protuberantly rotund ruler

41:45.410 --> 41:46.808
has always
dreamed of flying

41:46.810 --> 41:49.812
ever since he was
a little chubby baby sultan.

41:49.814 --> 41:52.649
And now, finally,
his dream came true.

41:52.651 --> 41:54.150
Yeah, but how?
Come on, tell us.

41:54.152 --> 41:57.120
They say that our hefty,
meat-mountain moghul

41:57.122 --> 42:00.156
has got his hands
on a flying carpet.

42:00.158 --> 42:01.424
A flying carpet?

42:01.426 --> 42:04.393
Yes, the Sultan
got it from The Rat,

42:04.395 --> 42:07.062
that little tawdry pest.

42:07.064 --> 42:08.263
And the worst thing

42:08.265 --> 42:11.266
is that he will be
the new General of the army.

42:11.268 --> 42:12.534
- No!
- Yes.

42:12.536 --> 42:14.870
I heard it
from the Sultan's own guards.

42:14.872 --> 42:15.605
No!

42:15.607 --> 42:17.507
So it really is
a flying carpet.

42:17.509 --> 42:18.741
That's what
I said all along.

42:18.743 --> 42:21.576
Hold on
to your fez and glasses,

42:21.578 --> 42:23.645
a flying carpet!

42:23.647 --> 42:25.647
I must admit,
I owe you one, bumpkin.

42:25.649 --> 42:27.285
You are not as stupid
as I thought.

42:27.986 --> 42:30.652
Wait, it's not
The Rat's carpet.

42:30.654 --> 42:32.087
- What?
- It's Hodja's.

42:32.089 --> 42:33.355
Yes.

42:33.357 --> 42:34.790
It's not
entirely mine.

42:34.792 --> 42:36.094
It's half mine.

42:36.527 --> 42:37.763
I borrowed it.

42:38.163 --> 42:39.763
Oh, no.

42:39.765 --> 42:43.699
I've heard that the Sultan is already
going to fly the carpet this afternoon.

42:43.701 --> 42:45.734
No, we have to
get it back before that.

42:45.736 --> 42:48.170
But that's
not possible, Hodja.

42:48.172 --> 42:50.906
But can't we just sneak
into the palace and take it?

42:50.908 --> 42:53.775
I'm telling you, it's harder to
get into the Sultan's palace

42:53.777 --> 42:56.145
than it is to get a camel
through one of my earrings.

42:56.881 --> 42:59.084
Oh, what are
we gonna do?

43:03.955 --> 43:06.656
You can't win
everytime, bumpkin.

43:06.658 --> 43:09.958
Come on. This one belongs
on the minus list.

43:09.960 --> 43:12.094
Sometimes you just have
to throw in the towel,

43:12.096 --> 43:13.795
or the carpet,
in this case.

43:13.797 --> 43:15.401
Yes.

43:16.067 --> 43:17.466
Sometimes.

43:17.468 --> 43:19.103
But it's not
gonna be this time.

43:20.305 --> 43:22.605
I promised to come home
with that carpet.

43:22.607 --> 43:24.574
And I promised
to find Diamond.

43:24.576 --> 43:26.078
And the promises you make,

43:26.578 --> 43:27.509
you keep.

43:27.511 --> 43:29.745
Wow, Hodja.

43:29.747 --> 43:31.714
Now you've got
nerves of steel.

43:31.716 --> 43:34.884
You know this is not
for wimps, right?

43:34.886 --> 43:36.919
Can you spot
any wimps here?

43:36.921 --> 43:39.522
Hey, listen to you.

43:39.524 --> 43:41.824
The bumpkin's
becoming a hero.

43:41.826 --> 43:43.792
A courageous hero.

43:45.029 --> 43:45.928
Well,

43:45.930 --> 43:48.130
we'd better help him then,
right, Raya?

43:49.901 --> 43:52.734
You know what?
I might be able to help you.

43:52.736 --> 43:53.803
It'll be hard.

43:53.805 --> 43:55.504
I bring food up to the palace.

43:55.506 --> 43:57.775
Not so loud.

44:00.745 --> 44:03.281
Now, tea
for everybody.

44:04.783 --> 44:07.516
A flying carpet
that you have borrowed

44:07.518 --> 44:08.850
has been stolen?

44:08.852 --> 44:12.654
I am so unbelievably tired
of that overfed Sultan.

44:12.656 --> 44:15.223
He just grabs
everything for himself.

44:15.225 --> 44:16.424
Exactly.

44:16.426 --> 44:19.127
We have to get you in there
so you can get that carpet back.

44:19.129 --> 44:21.931
Yes, and I know
how to do it.

44:21.933 --> 44:24.801
But, unfortunately,
we can't bring your goat.

44:24.803 --> 44:26.601
- 'Cause we are going...
- Mm-hmm.

44:26.603 --> 44:28.770
...door where
the guards are...

44:33.877 --> 44:35.213
How about that?

44:35.547 --> 44:36.612
Yes.

44:36.614 --> 44:38.217
We need to leave
immediately.

44:38.549 --> 44:39.417
Hmm?

44:41.451 --> 44:43.286
Ooh, nice.

44:49.694 --> 44:51.330
Bye Raya, see you.

44:54.198 --> 44:57.033
Aw, it will be okay.

44:57.035 --> 44:58.536
He will be back, Raya.

44:59.504 --> 45:00.839
<i>Inshallah.</i>

45:01.406 --> 45:02.507
Good luck.

45:14.585 --> 45:15.788
Ooh.

45:34.305 --> 45:36.938
Ah, the lovely Gemstone.

45:36.940 --> 45:39.074
It's so nice to see you.

45:39.076 --> 45:43.045
Are you bringing some stuff
here for our noble Sultan?

45:43.047 --> 45:45.647
Whatever it is,
I'd say it's lovely.

45:45.649 --> 45:48.384
Thanks.
Yes, doesn't it?

45:48.386 --> 45:52.721
Mmm, it does. But, uh, we are gonna
have to investigate thoroughly.

45:52.723 --> 45:54.857
You think I have
something to hide?

45:54.859 --> 45:57.292
Oh. No.

45:57.294 --> 45:59.261
Yeah, uh, no.

45:59.263 --> 46:02.033
I would never
say anything.

46:04.335 --> 46:07.569
Look, we just have
to check your baskets.

46:07.571 --> 46:09.471
Just following orders,
you know.

46:09.473 --> 46:12.375
- Ooh.
- Oh, wow. What beautiful melons.

46:12.377 --> 46:13.676
Thanks.

46:13.678 --> 46:15.377
Yeah, I'll just
check this one.

46:15.379 --> 46:16.978
Not that there's anything,
you know.

46:18.482 --> 46:20.216
Hey, it bit me!

46:20.218 --> 46:22.484
You are so funny.

46:22.486 --> 46:25.154
Uh, you probably pricked
yourself on a cactus fig.

46:25.156 --> 46:28.991
A big, strong, muscular man
like you are,

46:28.993 --> 46:30.525
wouldn't even feel that.

46:30.527 --> 46:32.795
No, no, no,
it was nothing.

46:35.866 --> 46:37.866
Hey, whenever
you're ready, guys.

46:37.868 --> 46:40.236
The Sultan's waiting
for his pigeon tongues.

46:51.882 --> 46:54.317
What were
you thinking, Hodja?

46:54.319 --> 46:57.085
It almost went wrong.
Why did you bite his finger?

46:57.087 --> 46:59.254
Sorry, but he
was tickling me.

47:01.459 --> 47:03.893
Whoa. What...

47:03.895 --> 47:05.861
Make sure that
nobody sees you.

47:05.863 --> 47:08.464
You would like to go home
in one piece, right?

47:08.466 --> 47:10.699
- Good luck, Hodja.
- Goodbye, Gemstone.

47:10.701 --> 47:13.034
- And thanks.
- Bye, Gemstone.

47:13.036 --> 47:14.770
We'll see you
later, right?

47:14.772 --> 47:16.275
Yes, you will.

47:17.375 --> 47:18.243
<i>Inshallah.</i>

47:20.578 --> 47:22.147
- Whoa!
- Hey, watch out.

47:30.321 --> 47:33.959
Wow!

47:34.725 --> 47:35.593
Come on.

47:42.332 --> 47:44.567
Oh, wow!

47:45.937 --> 47:48.870
You probably never saw a palace
like this before, huh, bumpkin?

47:48.872 --> 47:50.306
No, have you?

47:50.308 --> 47:52.208
No, of course not.

47:52.210 --> 47:54.713
They don't exactly have
open house on weekends.

47:57.114 --> 47:58.813
But, you are right.

47:58.815 --> 48:01.016
I am a bumpkin.

48:01.018 --> 48:05.223
Well, bumpkin is just
something I say, Hodja.

48:05.622 --> 48:06.821
You're okay.

48:06.823 --> 48:09.058
- You think so?
- Yes.

48:09.060 --> 48:13.995
You can't help if you come
from back end of nowhere.

48:13.997 --> 48:16.531
It's actually
really nice in Pjort.

48:16.533 --> 48:18.102
I have
a wonderful mom.

48:19.370 --> 48:22.040
- And dad.
- Oh, lucky you.

48:22.939 --> 48:24.140
I wish I had.

48:24.142 --> 48:26.678
What do you mean? Don't
you have a mom and dad?

48:27.779 --> 48:29.411
I don't really
have a family.

48:29.413 --> 48:32.781
Well, yes, a grandfather,
but...

48:32.783 --> 48:34.382
I don't even know
where he lives.

48:34.384 --> 48:38.122
He could sit on a mountain top
in Mongolia for all I know.

48:39.156 --> 48:41.457
So, I'll probably
never find him.

48:41.459 --> 48:44.426
If we find the carpet,
then we could fly home.

48:44.428 --> 48:45.928
And you could
stay with me.

48:45.930 --> 48:48.196
When we find
the carpet, Hodja.

48:48.198 --> 48:50.466
- I would really like that.
- Great.

48:50.468 --> 48:54.136
And then, we'll go to Mongolia
to find your grandfather.

48:54.138 --> 48:56.938
It's a deal. Come on. Let's go
steal the carpet back.

48:56.940 --> 48:58.042
Yeah.

49:08.718 --> 49:10.788
I'm finished.

49:11.522 --> 49:12.754
Clean-up time.

49:12.756 --> 49:14.723
- Come on. Chop-chop.
- Um, yes.

49:14.725 --> 49:17.493
Ye-Yes, I'm coming,
my dear.

49:17.495 --> 49:21.964
There. Now you're
all clean again.

49:21.966 --> 49:25.167
Are you full,
my little mouse?

49:25.169 --> 49:26.902
One can never be
completely full.

49:26.904 --> 49:28.337
- Huh?
- But I might just make it

49:28.339 --> 49:30.705
until it's time
for my third lunch.

49:34.879 --> 49:36.112
Well, well.

49:36.114 --> 49:37.679
That was really
something, sweetie.

49:37.681 --> 49:41.650
Yes, but much better out
than in, my little honey pie.

49:41.652 --> 49:45.154
Now, where is that ugly, pruny
little rat man with my carpet?

49:45.156 --> 49:46.754
I feel like flying.

49:46.756 --> 49:49.058
- Yeah.
- On my way.

49:50.194 --> 49:51.993
Here, here I am,
Your Highness.

49:51.995 --> 49:53.761
Your, your most...

49:53.763 --> 49:55.563
Oh, no,
not all that again.

49:55.565 --> 49:57.266
Why don't you
stick a cork in it?

49:57.268 --> 49:59.438
The carpet!
The carpet!

50:02.205 --> 50:05.908
Here. There you go,
Your Greatness.

50:05.910 --> 50:07.942
Well, don't just
stand there.

50:07.944 --> 50:10.045
Move me!

50:10.047 --> 50:13.251
Pull my legs. Do I have
to do everything myself?

50:15.085 --> 50:18.620
Fools. Can't you do
anything right?

50:18.622 --> 50:21.092
A trip to the crocodiles for...

50:23.027 --> 50:24.426
You there.

50:24.428 --> 50:26.428
- Wh-What?
- Yes, you magnificence.

50:26.430 --> 50:28.767
- Uh, uh, no, no, no!
- Right away.

50:31.902 --> 50:33.669
Well, now that that's done,

50:33.671 --> 50:36.871
now we can taxi to the
runway, flight captain.

50:40.611 --> 50:43.882
I shall be the world's
first flying sultan.

50:46.049 --> 50:48.783
Nothing less,
Your Magnificence.

50:48.785 --> 50:51.620
Oh, you think big
and smart.

50:51.622 --> 50:55.790
Yes, are you ready
for the flight of your life?

50:55.792 --> 50:58.092
Yes, chocks away.

50:58.094 --> 51:01.230
Fly, O magic carpet.

51:01.232 --> 51:03.368
Fly!

51:05.703 --> 51:07.736
Ylf, teprac!

51:07.738 --> 51:09.241
Ylf...

51:11.075 --> 51:13.277
I said ylf...

51:15.680 --> 51:17.145
What's wrong?

51:17.147 --> 51:18.716
Is it not
a flying carpet?

51:19.716 --> 51:21.283
Oh, yes,
of course it is.

51:21.285 --> 51:25.620
It-It's just not used to flying
with such an enormous...

51:25.622 --> 51:27.191
personality?

51:27.825 --> 51:30.792
So fly, you lazy carpet.

51:30.794 --> 51:32.530
Your sultan
commands it.

51:36.968 --> 51:38.299
Why you...

51:38.301 --> 51:40.669
Mutinous, rebellious...

51:40.671 --> 51:43.871
Throw that filthy carpet
to the crocodiles.

51:43.873 --> 51:46.507
But, uh,
it's a carpet.

51:46.509 --> 51:50.145
We just risk getting the
crocodiles constipated again.

51:50.147 --> 51:53.582
Yes, your crocodiles
are a tad sensitive.

51:53.584 --> 51:56.652
They're the lesser spotted
Western Nile crocodile.

51:56.654 --> 52:00.188
And while your illustriousness
is having lunch,

52:00.190 --> 52:02.493
I'll beat some sense
into that carpet.

52:06.997 --> 52:09.198
No worries,
O highest Sultan.

52:09.200 --> 52:10.801
It'll be fine.

52:12.136 --> 52:14.236
Ooh, yum yum.

52:14.238 --> 52:16.640
I'll teach you a lesson
you'll never forget.

52:21.846 --> 52:22.814
- Oh.
- Oh.

52:24.281 --> 52:25.517
Come, come.

52:27.018 --> 52:27.953
Hmm.

52:32.290 --> 52:33.592
Follow me.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.600
There's Rat
with the carpet.

52:44.602 --> 52:45.469
Quickly.

52:47.004 --> 52:47.906
Oh.

52:57.681 --> 52:58.750
Ooh.

53:10.828 --> 53:14.532
I know full well that
you're a flying carpet.

53:15.433 --> 53:17.165
And if you
don't fly soon,

53:17.167 --> 53:19.335
I'll unravel you faster
than you can say,

53:19.337 --> 53:23.304
"Five flat fattened figs on a
flattened fat fig vessel."

53:26.410 --> 53:30.446
I also saw how you
threw the Sultan off.

53:30.448 --> 53:33.681
A thing like that could get me
thrown to the crocodiles.

53:33.683 --> 53:35.484
And that's not
gonna happen

53:35.486 --> 53:37.618
this close to
achieving my goal.

53:37.620 --> 53:40.188
I'll make you fly if
it's the last thing I do

53:40.190 --> 53:43.361
so I can become General.

53:49.632 --> 53:51.232
Hmm.

53:51.234 --> 53:54.002
Then I no longer
have to bow and scrape.

53:54.004 --> 53:56.138
Then
I can do what I want.

53:56.140 --> 53:59.375
Then it's-it's me
who decides.

53:59.377 --> 54:03.348
And no more
calling me "Rat."

54:05.815 --> 54:07.049
Huh?

54:07.051 --> 54:09.554
What? Huh?
Stop! Stop!

54:12.189 --> 54:13.058
Throw!

54:17.460 --> 54:20.161
Hey! Hey...

54:20.163 --> 54:21.696
- What a little darling.
- Hey.

54:21.698 --> 54:23.632
I always wanted one
like that.

54:23.634 --> 54:24.799
Very soft.

54:24.801 --> 54:27.469
This boy has stolen
from the Sultan.

54:27.471 --> 54:28.504
He must be punished!

54:28.506 --> 54:30.906
Nobody's going
to be punished here.

54:30.908 --> 54:34.379
Such a little sugar pet.
We'll mind you.

54:37.415 --> 54:39.380
What?
What's that noise?

54:39.382 --> 54:43.051
Do you want me to throw you all,
my own wives, to the crocodiles?

54:43.053 --> 54:44.486
Look what we found.

54:44.488 --> 54:47.723
- Isn't he adorable?
- If we wash him, and give him some clean clothes...

54:47.725 --> 54:49.290
May we keep him?

54:49.292 --> 54:50.692
Please, can't we?

54:50.694 --> 54:54.163
Your Magnificence, this boy
has tried to steal your carpet.

54:54.165 --> 54:55.596
What are you saying?

54:55.598 --> 54:58.232
Your Magnificence, this boy
has tried to steal your carpet.

54:58.234 --> 55:00.137
Yes, I heard you fine
the first time.

55:01.004 --> 55:02.237
Stop that nonsense.

55:02.239 --> 55:04.071
- It's hurting my ears.
- Oh, dear.

55:04.073 --> 55:05.908
He needs minding.

55:05.910 --> 55:07.308
Oh, how sad that...

55:07.310 --> 55:08.743
- He smells of goat.
- We'll wash him.

55:08.745 --> 55:10.212
He'll be so nice.

55:10.214 --> 55:11.946
He'll be like a rose bud.

55:12.982 --> 55:14.449
And he has fleas.

55:14.451 --> 55:16.250
Fleas? He has fleas?

55:16.252 --> 55:18.520
Run! I can already
feel the creatures!

55:18.522 --> 55:21.156
- Itchy! Itchy! Ew!
- I can already feel them all over me!

55:24.261 --> 55:26.498
So you want
to steal my carpet?

55:27.163 --> 55:28.230
You little worm.

55:28.232 --> 55:29.397
I'm not a worm.

55:29.399 --> 55:32.467
What? You dare to
contradict me, young worm?

55:32.469 --> 55:36.071
The great Sultan
Harun Al-Kaheed

55:36.073 --> 55:38.440
Bin Sulaiman Makhmood Fasai

55:38.442 --> 55:41.844
Abdul Rahim Jabbar
Hakeem Zaheer...

55:42.846 --> 55:46.884
...Abdul Azeem Ruma
Ipdin Al-Khattab?

55:47.951 --> 55:48.750
Guards!

55:48.752 --> 55:50.922
Throw him
to the crocodiles.

55:52.056 --> 55:54.159
Um, wait, wait.
Stop!

55:55.359 --> 55:56.859
What's that you say?

55:56.861 --> 55:59.161
Is it now the fashion
to contradict me?

55:59.163 --> 56:00.031
Uh...

56:00.763 --> 56:01.763
No. No, no.

56:01.765 --> 56:05.033
But can't we just put him
in jail, you know?

56:05.035 --> 56:06.703
Eh, temporarily.

56:07.738 --> 56:09.937
Whatever for, by the beard
of all the prophets?

56:09.939 --> 56:12.174
My little crocodiles
will not go hungry.

56:12.176 --> 56:13.375
Uh,

56:13.377 --> 56:15.344
no, no, but, uh,

56:15.346 --> 56:17.578
but, but it's just
that right now,

56:17.580 --> 56:20.382
he's the only one who knows
how to make the carpet fly.

56:20.384 --> 56:22.116
So...

56:22.118 --> 56:24.620
How very confusing.

56:24.622 --> 56:27.522
- Well, throw him in the dungeons first.
- No!

56:27.524 --> 56:29.790
Then we throw him
to the crocodiles afterwards.

56:33.696 --> 56:35.397
Let go of me!

56:35.399 --> 56:38.266
I haven't done anything.
It's my carpet.

56:38.268 --> 56:40.435
The Rat stole it from me.

56:40.437 --> 56:41.937
Gee, that's exciting.

56:41.939 --> 56:43.971
I wish you could tell me
more about it,

56:43.973 --> 56:46.408
if I wasn't so
incredibly indifferent.

57:00.890 --> 57:06.661
So, you're here again to disturb
me with all your noise.

57:06.663 --> 57:10.801
The constant whirlwind
of muscles and stupidity.

57:13.603 --> 57:15.203
But, uh, Grim,

57:15.205 --> 57:18.373
it's been more than ten years
since we brought you a prisoner.

57:18.375 --> 57:21.710
Yeah, after the Sultan began
throwing everyone to the crocodiles,

57:21.712 --> 57:24.112
you haven't had too many
customers in your shop.

57:24.114 --> 57:25.313
Yeah, yeah.

57:25.315 --> 57:27.815
I better open
the office then.

57:27.817 --> 57:29.917
Throw him
into number seven.

57:29.919 --> 57:32.487
It was clean
not too long ago.

57:34.325 --> 57:35.627
With pleasure.

57:41.966 --> 57:43.268
A load of fuss.

57:45.134 --> 57:46.435
What am I gonna do?

57:46.437 --> 57:48.306
I've ruined everything.

57:50.674 --> 57:53.275
Now I'll never get home
to my mom and dad again.

57:55.980 --> 57:58.248
I wonder,
do they think of me?

58:12.428 --> 58:14.529
Here you go.

58:14.531 --> 58:16.797
Water yesterday,
water today.

58:16.799 --> 58:18.236
Water again tomorrow.

58:19.136 --> 58:20.868
I really miss milk.

58:20.870 --> 58:24.038
Yes, milk is good.

58:24.040 --> 58:26.577
But it's not just
the goat you miss.

58:28.044 --> 58:30.578
It's all too quiet
without Hodja.

58:30.580 --> 58:32.783
It's like he's
been gone forever.

58:34.484 --> 58:37.187
Take care that I don't
get too fond of you.

58:41.125 --> 58:43.290
And what about El Faza?

58:43.292 --> 58:45.127
I haven't found his Diamond.

58:45.129 --> 58:46.560
And what about Emerald?

58:47.665 --> 58:50.899
No, I can't sit here
and count spiders.

58:50.901 --> 58:52.736
I have to get
out of here.

58:57.573 --> 59:00.609
It's no use
threatening a carpet.

59:00.611 --> 59:04.815
I swear by my fez,
I will be General.

59:13.489 --> 59:15.292
There's only
one thing to do.

59:17.995 --> 59:20.261
I have to use
that meddling boy.

59:20.263 --> 59:23.198
He's the only one who can
get that carpet to fly.

59:23.200 --> 59:24.636
And you!

59:25.268 --> 59:26.500
Come with me.

59:26.502 --> 59:28.305
We don't want
any escape attempts.

59:30.741 --> 59:31.909
Let me out!

59:32.509 --> 59:33.708
Let me out!

59:33.710 --> 59:35.609
I haven't done
anything wrong.

59:35.611 --> 59:37.011
Yeah, yeah.

59:37.013 --> 59:40.684
- Everyone's innocent. Check.
- Somebody let me out!

59:47.457 --> 59:49.860
Oh, I'm in checkmate.

59:56.567 --> 59:58.567
Why didn't
I think of that?

59:58.569 --> 01:00:02.006
There are lots of loose bricks
in an old prison like this.

01:00:18.888 --> 01:00:22.190
Booyaka! Hodja Houdini!

01:00:22.192 --> 01:00:23.428
I'm free!

01:00:28.832 --> 01:00:30.397
Huh, let's see.

01:00:30.399 --> 01:00:31.366
Hey.

01:00:31.368 --> 01:00:33.734
Hello. Let me out!

01:00:33.736 --> 01:00:35.906
I'm innocent. Really.

01:00:41.944 --> 01:00:42.913
Huh?

01:00:44.781 --> 01:00:47.616
What the heck
is going on?

01:00:47.618 --> 01:00:49.484
Why is there a boy
in number eight?

01:00:49.486 --> 01:00:51.855
I'm sure I put him
in number seven.

01:00:52.656 --> 01:00:56.259
What is going on?
Unbelievable.

01:00:59.696 --> 01:01:02.129
So this is
number seven. Huh!

01:01:02.131 --> 01:01:04.434
Hi there. Are you
gonna let me out?

01:01:05.435 --> 01:01:07.536
Huh? I don't get it.

01:01:07.538 --> 01:01:08.773
What's going on?

01:01:10.439 --> 01:01:12.109
Why are there
two boys now?

01:01:22.085 --> 01:01:23.521
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:01:25.388 --> 01:01:26.923
This can't be happening.

01:01:32.428 --> 01:01:33.396
Oh.

01:01:36.265 --> 01:01:37.134
Huh?

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.667
- Hi.
- Oh.

01:01:39.669 --> 01:01:42.405
Going crazy.
Going crazy.

01:01:44.006 --> 01:01:45.275
Is there
something wrong?

01:01:47.176 --> 01:01:48.542
Huh? No, I...

01:01:48.544 --> 01:01:50.411
I'm just a little confused.

01:01:50.413 --> 01:01:52.948
There's a boy next door
in number eight,

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:56.217
and as far as I can see,
he looks just like you.

01:01:56.219 --> 01:01:57.118
Yeah.

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.520
It's probably
just a street kid

01:01:58.522 --> 01:02:01.422
that's conned his way in
to get free food and lodging.

01:02:01.424 --> 01:02:02.794
I heard about that.

01:02:03.794 --> 01:02:04.926
Is that right?

01:02:04.928 --> 01:02:07.462
I never heard about
that kind of thing.

01:02:07.464 --> 01:02:11.399
Well, I guess I need to get
out and about more often.

01:02:11.401 --> 01:02:12.533
Just you wait.

01:02:12.535 --> 01:02:14.969
Soon all the cells will be
filled with street kids

01:02:14.971 --> 01:02:17.239
who scrounge for food
and a place to sleep.

01:02:17.241 --> 01:02:20.011
Can you imagine
how noisy that would be?

01:02:22.078 --> 01:02:24.078
We'll have none
of that around here.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.882
I'm gonna end this racket.

01:02:31.053 --> 01:02:33.323
Out you go,
you little freeloader.

01:02:36.026 --> 01:02:37.025
Out!

01:02:37.027 --> 01:02:38.826
And you can tell
all your freeloading friends

01:02:38.828 --> 01:02:40.795
that Grim
ain't an easy fellow to fool.

01:02:40.797 --> 01:02:42.033
- Hey.
- Hah!

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.201
Yeah.

01:02:46.203 --> 01:02:47.736
I still got it.

01:02:47.738 --> 01:02:49.103
Don't I, kid?

01:02:49.105 --> 01:02:50.105
Huh?

01:02:50.107 --> 01:02:50.975
Kid?

01:02:52.375 --> 01:02:55.446
Huh? Kid!

01:02:57.413 --> 01:02:58.915
He ran off on me.

01:02:59.549 --> 01:03:00.949
Behind my back,

01:03:00.951 --> 01:03:03.120
while I was throwing
the other one out.

01:03:03.587 --> 01:03:05.189
Oh, darn it.

01:03:07.323 --> 01:03:10.594
I had a feeling this day
was gonna end badly.

01:03:19.569 --> 01:03:21.036
Come on.

01:03:21.038 --> 01:03:24.739
There's no mystery to going
quickly down the staircase.

01:03:24.741 --> 01:03:26.944
Just put your
best foot forward.

01:03:28.344 --> 01:03:33.580
Uh, but both my feet
are equally pretty.

01:03:33.582 --> 01:03:36.016
It's just a saying.

01:03:36.018 --> 01:03:37.284
- Oh, I see.
- It means...

01:03:37.286 --> 01:03:39.422
- Hi there.
- ...get a move on.

01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:41.459
Why do I bother?

01:03:48.497 --> 01:03:49.496
Let's go.

01:03:49.498 --> 01:03:51.401
Don't just lie there.
Get after him!

01:03:56.906 --> 01:03:59.009
Hodja, you're alive.

01:03:59.942 --> 01:04:01.875
I thought...

01:04:01.877 --> 01:04:03.310
I'm so happy
to see you.

01:04:03.312 --> 01:04:05.148
- And you got the carpet.
- Yeah.

01:04:06.515 --> 01:04:07.384
This way.

01:04:15.024 --> 01:04:16.293
Teprac ylf.

01:04:17.294 --> 01:04:18.395
Quick. Jump.

01:04:22.466 --> 01:04:23.598
No!

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.000
They're getting away.

01:04:25.002 --> 01:04:27.171
Close all the doors.
Now!

01:04:27.636 --> 01:04:28.506
Huh?

01:04:30.406 --> 01:04:31.473
Whoa!

01:04:35.611 --> 01:04:37.112
No way out.

01:04:37.114 --> 01:04:39.013
Like vermin
in a trap.

01:04:39.015 --> 01:04:40.882
Who's the rat now?

01:04:42.685 --> 01:04:43.553
Huh?

01:04:46.989 --> 01:04:48.158
Faster.

01:04:54.096 --> 01:04:56.297
Just like I told sweetie pie.

01:04:56.299 --> 01:04:57.364
Did you?

01:05:00.404 --> 01:05:02.237
Oh, no! Fleas!

01:05:02.239 --> 01:05:04.575
He has fleas!
Throw them out!

01:05:05.375 --> 01:05:06.708
You have fleas?

01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:09.411
Well, it would have been nice to
know before you hugged me earlier.

01:05:09.413 --> 01:05:10.478
No, I don't.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.580
That was just something
The Rat said.

01:05:12.582 --> 01:05:13.517
Quiet.

01:05:14.551 --> 01:05:16.583
They flew in here.

01:05:16.585 --> 01:05:20.654
Out! Out! This place
is off-limits for men.

01:05:20.656 --> 01:05:22.690
Catch those kids!

01:05:22.692 --> 01:05:24.826
Order from the Sultan.

01:05:24.828 --> 01:05:27.661
Then it's whopping time!

01:05:33.969 --> 01:05:35.272
I got them!

01:05:37.207 --> 01:05:38.075
Not.

01:05:45.515 --> 01:05:46.484
This way.

01:05:48.018 --> 01:05:49.253
After them.

01:06:19.348 --> 01:06:21.482
What?
What's happening?

01:06:21.484 --> 01:06:24.152
Did I not throw that little
worm into the dungeon?

01:06:24.154 --> 01:06:26.654
What is he doing
with my carpet?

01:06:26.656 --> 01:06:27.690
Go after him. Now!

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:32.595
Whoa!

01:06:35.832 --> 01:06:37.535
Close those doors!

01:06:50.446 --> 01:06:51.614
Buffoon!

01:06:56.652 --> 01:06:57.951
The Rat is a thief!

01:06:57.953 --> 01:06:59.187
He stole my carpet

01:06:59.189 --> 01:07:00.989
but he doesn't know
how to make it fly.

01:07:00.991 --> 01:07:02.357
Yes, he did it.

01:07:02.359 --> 01:07:04.862
He stole it because he wants
to become your General.

01:07:10.433 --> 01:07:14.169
Do you really think I care who
this carpet's previous owner was?

01:07:14.171 --> 01:07:16.437
Because now
it's my carpet.

01:07:16.439 --> 01:07:19.339
And that's the only thing
that matters.

01:07:19.341 --> 01:07:21.875
You can't just take
other people's things.

01:07:21.877 --> 01:07:24.145
Oh, can't I?
Oh, that's funny.

01:07:24.147 --> 01:07:26.080
Because that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

01:07:26.082 --> 01:07:28.315
But I do plan to give
something in return.

01:07:28.317 --> 01:07:32.252
I intend, for instance, to give your
little girlfriend to my crocodiles.

01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:36.626
- Hey, back.
- Let go of me!

01:07:37.393 --> 01:07:39.027
- Let go of me!
- Wait!

01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:41.529
Listen, you know
that I'm the only person

01:07:41.531 --> 01:07:43.565
who can show you
how to fly the carpet.

01:07:43.567 --> 01:07:46.770
But I'll only do so
if you release Emerald.

01:07:47.136 --> 01:07:48.439
Deal?

01:07:50.573 --> 01:07:52.040
Okay, it's a deal.

01:07:52.042 --> 01:07:53.473
You show us
how we fly the carpet,

01:07:53.475 --> 01:07:56.044
then, then, uh, yes,
we'll let the girl go free.

01:07:56.046 --> 01:07:57.712
No, Hodja.

01:07:57.714 --> 01:07:59.547
No! You cannot trust them!

01:07:59.549 --> 01:08:01.152
- Put those spears away.
- No!

01:08:03.419 --> 01:08:05.085
We'll have to fly outside.

01:08:05.087 --> 01:08:06.620
We wouldn't want
our great Sultan

01:08:06.622 --> 01:08:10.123
to hit his pretty head off
the ceiling now, would we?

01:08:10.125 --> 01:08:12.263
Yes, yes,
that sounds sensible.

01:08:23.037 --> 01:08:23.907
Teprac.

01:08:25.242 --> 01:08:28.479
Ll'ew teg taht natlus.

01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:41.622
Please, take your place,
Your Lordship.

01:08:41.625 --> 01:08:43.790
I should bring
a co-pilot with me.

01:08:43.792 --> 01:08:44.859
I can do it.

01:08:44.861 --> 01:08:46.859
No, no,
that won't do.

01:08:46.862 --> 01:08:48.362
You could kidnap me.

01:08:48.363 --> 01:08:50.198
Think I was born yesterday?

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:51.832
The Rat will go.

01:08:51.835 --> 01:08:53.703
Yes, of course.

01:09:04.345 --> 01:09:06.349
- Please.
- Certainly.

01:09:07.751 --> 01:09:09.953
Perfect.
Now we're ready.

01:09:11.121 --> 01:09:13.053
Here we go.

01:09:13.055 --> 01:09:15.625
Ylf, teprac.

01:09:25.068 --> 01:09:26.767
I can fly!

01:09:26.769 --> 01:09:28.703
Look, I can fly!

01:09:28.705 --> 01:09:32.038
And I am General!

01:09:32.041 --> 01:09:33.473
A very good general.

01:09:33.475 --> 01:09:35.375
- Let's take a little trip.
- Yes.

01:09:35.377 --> 01:09:37.078
Let us, my Sultan.

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:43.017
Don't worry. We will be back
at crocodile feeding time.

01:09:45.354 --> 01:09:48.358
Won, teprac, won!

01:09:49.626 --> 01:09:51.761
No, no. No, no,
not down. Up.

01:09:52.328 --> 01:09:53.993
- Won.
- No, no, no.

01:09:53.996 --> 01:09:55.163
No. Stop!

01:09:55.165 --> 01:09:56.297
To the right.

01:09:56.299 --> 01:09:57.935
To the left!

01:10:02.471 --> 01:10:05.376
Down, boy!
You'll give me a fall.

01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:08.375
This is very stressful.

01:10:08.377 --> 01:10:10.581
Can we stop?
I want to get down.

01:10:11.214 --> 01:10:12.547
I want to get down!

01:10:12.549 --> 01:10:14.649
Don't worry.
You will.

01:10:14.651 --> 01:10:17.988
Worht meht ot eht selidocorc.

01:10:24.993 --> 01:10:26.296
Ow!

01:10:35.971 --> 01:10:37.905
Oh! Make it stop!

01:10:41.577 --> 01:10:43.910
This is not good.
Not good at all.

01:10:43.912 --> 01:10:45.315
Teprac, won.

01:10:48.751 --> 01:10:51.455
Oh, Mommy!

01:11:04.634 --> 01:11:05.732
Help me.

01:11:10.439 --> 01:11:12.009
Run! Keep running!

01:11:15.444 --> 01:11:16.979
Get a move on.

01:11:18.547 --> 01:11:21.281
I'm going
as fast as I can!

01:11:21.283 --> 01:11:22.618
- Huh?
- Huh?

01:11:24.354 --> 01:11:26.023
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

01:11:35.364 --> 01:11:36.800
- Hodja.
- Emerald.

01:11:37.767 --> 01:11:39.066
Uh, no you don't.

01:11:39.068 --> 01:11:40.334
No, let her go.

01:11:40.336 --> 01:11:42.503
She's to be thrown
to the crocodiles.

01:11:42.505 --> 01:11:43.907
Orders from the Sultan.

01:11:45.274 --> 01:11:46.643
What sultan?

01:11:47.577 --> 01:11:49.509
There is no sultan anymore.

01:11:49.511 --> 01:11:51.344
You can do as you wish.

01:11:51.346 --> 01:11:54.414
But I like getting orders.

01:11:54.416 --> 01:11:58.319
Okay, do whatever you like.
That's an order.

01:11:58.321 --> 01:12:00.588
I wanna be
a camel breeder.

01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:02.593
I think I'd like
an ice cream.

01:12:06.795 --> 01:12:09.629
You know what? It's the
best day of my life.

01:12:09.631 --> 01:12:12.400
Now I can finally get
that vegetable garden.

01:12:12.402 --> 01:12:13.935
Everyone is free now.

01:12:13.937 --> 01:12:16.337
And you can
all share everything.

01:12:16.339 --> 01:12:17.741
Just as it should be.

01:12:19.408 --> 01:12:22.145
And now, let's get going.
Shall we?

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:25.279
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

01:12:25.281 --> 01:12:27.147
- Bye now.
- Goodbye. See ya.

01:12:27.149 --> 01:12:29.417
- Come back and visit us soon.
- Don't be a stranger.

01:12:29.419 --> 01:12:32.756
I'll make something delicious
with coriander.

01:12:36.392 --> 01:12:37.825
Gee, that's pretty.

01:12:37.827 --> 01:12:40.160
It'll be the latest fashion
in Petto.

01:12:40.162 --> 01:12:42.496
Wow. Look.

01:12:42.498 --> 01:12:44.432
Oh.

01:12:44.434 --> 01:12:46.100
- Oh, there they are.
- Hi, Hodja.

01:12:46.102 --> 01:12:48.503
- Hi, Emerald.
- Hey, down there.

01:12:51.241 --> 01:12:53.007
Oh, Raya.

01:12:53.009 --> 01:12:54.441
Oh, how I missed you.

01:12:56.513 --> 01:12:58.745
You've been
so brilliant, Hodja.

01:12:58.747 --> 01:13:01.518
Yes, now everything's great.

01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:07.056
I never found Diamond.

01:13:07.422 --> 01:13:08.688
Huh?

01:13:08.690 --> 01:13:09.559
Huh?

01:13:10.993 --> 01:13:11.862
What?

01:13:15.398 --> 01:13:17.531
Diamond?

01:13:17.533 --> 01:13:20.567
That's what my grandfather called
me since I was a little girl.

01:13:20.569 --> 01:13:22.802
He could never remember
that I'm called Emerald.

01:13:22.804 --> 01:13:24.338
So, you've known
all the time.

01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:28.308
Of course. You don't play a trump
card like that immediately.

01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:32.646
Besides, I would have missed that
silly face of yours right now.

01:13:32.648 --> 01:13:36.083
Eh, but you're still coming
with me to Pjort, right?

01:13:36.085 --> 01:13:38.485
Sort of looks that way,
country bumpkin.

01:13:38.487 --> 01:13:40.656
Huh?

01:13:42.858 --> 01:13:44.525
- Goodbye, friends.
- Bye-bye.

01:13:44.527 --> 01:13:45.526
Bye.

01:13:45.528 --> 01:13:47.460
- See you soon.
- Bye.

01:13:47.462 --> 01:13:49.062
Bye!

01:14:03.779 --> 01:14:05.378
Wow!

01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:06.847
What does it mean anyway?

01:14:06.849 --> 01:14:09.917
"Worht meht ot eht selidocorc"?

01:14:09.919 --> 01:14:11.819
I spoke backwards
to the carpet.

01:14:11.821 --> 01:14:14.054
It means, "Throw them
to the crocodiles."

01:14:14.056 --> 01:14:16.656
The carpet and I
had a plan, and it worked.

01:14:16.658 --> 01:14:18.726
Well, what do you know.

01:14:18.728 --> 01:14:20.764
There's more than chickpeas
in there.

01:14:24.067 --> 01:14:25.900
Whoa!

01:14:25.902 --> 01:14:27.567
There's Pjort.
There's my home!

01:14:27.569 --> 01:14:29.273
Oh, wow.
It's so pretty.

01:14:33.142 --> 01:14:34.342
El Faza.

01:14:34.344 --> 01:14:36.846
Huh. Hodja!

01:14:37.513 --> 01:14:39.446
Uh, the carpet,

01:14:39.448 --> 01:14:41.915
and my Diamond.

01:14:41.917 --> 01:14:46.052
- How much you have grown, my little girl.
- Grandfather!

01:14:46.054 --> 01:14:47.120
Wow!

01:14:48.358 --> 01:14:51.258
Oh, how I missed you.

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:54.197
My sweet darling
little Diamond.

01:15:06.341 --> 01:15:08.142
Oh, Mom.

01:15:11.613 --> 01:15:14.280
I'm sorry
I left you in Petto.

01:15:14.282 --> 01:15:15.749
You didn't have
a choice.

01:15:15.751 --> 01:15:17.151
And anyway,
there's not much fun

01:15:17.153 --> 01:15:19.954
having a grandfather who's
been eaten by a crocodile.

01:15:22.024 --> 01:15:25.228
Ah, it's so wonderful
that we're all here together.

01:15:26.162 --> 01:15:28.829
You really have done
so well, Hodja.

01:15:28.831 --> 01:15:32.769
I'm so proud
of my very brave son.

01:15:36.139 --> 01:15:37.370
Yes.

01:15:37.372 --> 01:15:39.106
Now we are a real family.

01:15:42.077 --> 01:15:43.879
Ylf, teprac.

01:15:57.926 --> 01:15:59.959
- Are you okay?
- Help him, Aram.

01:15:59.961 --> 01:16:01.964
Oh, thank you.
