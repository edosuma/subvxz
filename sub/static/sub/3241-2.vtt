WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:03.382
<i>Previously...</i>

00:03.462 --> 00:05.681
<i>We were in Scotland
on our second honeymoon.</i>

00:05.756 --> 00:07.633
This is a pattern
I've not seen before.

00:07.716 --> 00:09.343
The marriage-finds divided.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.724
The life line's forked.

00:11.803 --> 00:13.726
Where will we be
watching this spectacle?

00:14.473 --> 00:16.567
<i>There is a place
called Craigh na Dun.</i>

00:16.642 --> 00:19.361
<i>There's a local group
who used to observe rituals there.</i>

00:27.110 --> 00:29.363
- You're not Frank.
- No, madam. I am not.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.664
- What's your name?
- Claire Beauchamp. I'm a nurse.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.377
Thank you, Sassenach. Truly.

00:39.456 --> 00:42.426
<i>As much as my rational mind
rebelled against the idea,</i>

00:42.501 --> 00:46.972
<i>I knew in my heart
I was no longer in the 20th century.</i>

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

02:50.587 --> 02:54.808
<i>The last time I was here,
Frank and I simply took the car.</i>

02:54.883 --> 02:58.262
<i>But after spending two days
and nights jolting along on a horse,</i>

02:58.345 --> 03:00.768
<i>I knew I'd never find my way back,</i>

03:00.847 --> 03:04.442
<i>not unless I convinced these people
to help me in some way.</i>

03:04.518 --> 03:06.361
Dougal, you're back early, man.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.359
We hadna thought to see ye
before the gathering.

03:08.438 --> 03:12.659
Aye, well, we've had some luck.
Some good, some bad.

03:12.734 --> 03:16.409
Rupert, ye great fat fart,
what have you done to my Peggy now?

03:16.488 --> 03:18.707
Did I not tell you
to tighten her girth?

03:18.782 --> 03:20.534
Let me be, old rat.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.496
I been riding all night, and
I don't need you squalling in my ear.

03:23.578 --> 03:25.171
Did ye never even look at her hooves?

03:25.247 --> 03:27.375
You canna expect any beast

03:27.457 --> 03:29.380
to carry around something
that weighs as much as you,

03:29.459 --> 03:31.461
without taking care
of the poor creature's feet.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.764
Like a cow riding a mouse.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.136
Shut yer hole.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.809
Rupert, m'dear!

03:45.892 --> 03:48.145
How good to see ye!

03:49.563 --> 03:50.985
My dear.

03:54.609 --> 03:57.613
Ye'll all be needing breakfast,
I reckon.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.448
Plenty in the kitchen.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.499
Away in, and feed yerselves.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.122
Murtagh,

04:07.205 --> 04:12.587
you look and smell like a rat that's
been dragged through sheep dung.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.467
Gi' us a kiss, then.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.173
- Oh, no!
- A kiss, then!

04:24.014 --> 04:26.984
And what do we have here?

04:33.356 --> 04:36.530
Claire Beauchamp,
Mistress Fitzgibbons.

04:40.322 --> 04:41.995
Murtagh found her,

04:42.073 --> 04:45.668
and Dougal said we must
bring her along with us, so...

04:45.744 --> 04:47.087
So.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.628
Well...

04:53.168 --> 04:54.169
Claire.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.474
Come with me.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.223
We shall find you something to eat,

05:02.302 --> 05:04.145
something to wear
that's a bit more...

05:06.056 --> 05:08.809
Well, a bit more.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.189
Well, what about him?

05:11.269 --> 05:13.988
- I can fend for myself.
- No, you're hurt.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.407
He was shot yesterday.

05:16.566 --> 05:19.410
- I'll be fine.
- No, you won't.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.913
I bandaged his shoulder,

05:21.988 --> 05:24.116
but I wasn't able to
clean it or dress it properly.

05:24.199 --> 05:25.997
I must tend to it
before it gets infected.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.376
I mean, inflamed.

05:31.623 --> 05:33.375
You know, with fever and swelling.

05:34.584 --> 05:35.836
Oh, aye.

05:37.128 --> 05:38.596
I ken fine what ye mean.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.594
But do you mean to say
you know what to do for that?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.603
Are ye a charmer, then?

05:49.724 --> 05:50.976
A Beaten?

05:53.103 --> 05:54.320
Something like that.

05:56.273 --> 05:57.866
Jamie.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.318
Ye heard the lady.

05:59.401 --> 06:01.278
Ye need tending.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.238
This way.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.951
Let's get you out of the rain.

06:26.636 --> 06:30.061
As ye asked, garlic and witch hazel
to boil the rags.

06:30.140 --> 06:33.189
I also brought comfrey
and cherry bark for the pain.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.482
Perfect.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.532
Call out if you need anything else.

06:42.277 --> 06:43.995
I will. Thank you, Mrs. Fitzgibbons.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.040
Everybody calls me Mrs. Fitz.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.831
You may also.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.115
The Redcoats.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.448
Flagged me twice
in the space of a week.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.789
They'd have done it twice
the same day, I expect,

07:27.864 --> 07:30.663
were they not afraid of killing me.

07:30.742 --> 07:33.370
There's no joy
in flogging a dead man.

07:35.038 --> 07:37.541
I shouldn't think anyone
would do such a thing for joy.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.251
Well,

07:39.334 --> 07:41.086
if Randall was not precisely joyous,

07:41.169 --> 07:43.843
he was at least
very pleased with himself.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.221
Clumsy. It'll have to
be boiled again.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.359
Why were you flogged?

07:59.521 --> 08:02.775
Well, the first time
was escaping Fort William.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.819
And the second was theft.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.245
Or at least, that's what
the charge sheet read.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.408
Why were you escaping
in the first place?

08:13.743 --> 08:15.996
They were holding me prisoner.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.080
I gathered that.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.885
Why? On what charge?

08:24.087 --> 08:25.805
That...

08:25.880 --> 08:27.632
I think it was obstruction.

08:29.092 --> 08:31.015
Obstruction? What's that?

08:31.094 --> 08:33.847
It doesn't sound like
a serious crime.

08:33.929 --> 08:35.773
Well,

08:35.849 --> 08:38.852
I suppose it's whatever
the English say it is.

08:42.605 --> 08:46.451
Aye, it was
near to four years ago now.

08:49.612 --> 08:53.242
<i>They put a levy on
all the landholders in the county,</i>

08:53.324 --> 08:56.123
<i>sent out small parties of soldiers,</i>

08:56.202 --> 08:59.547
<i>collecting food,
horses for transport, and suchlike.</i>

09:02.292 --> 09:04.294
<i>Aye, it was one day in October,</i>

09:04.377 --> 09:07.096
<i>Captain Randall
came along to our place.</i>

09:09.466 --> 09:12.811
<i>My father was away.
He'd gone to a funeral.</i>

09:15.430 --> 09:18.309
<i>I was up in the fields
when I heard shouting.</i>

09:18.391 --> 09:20.268
No!

09:20.351 --> 09:21.819
No, no!

09:26.066 --> 09:27.784
Jenny!

09:28.985 --> 09:30.157
Jenny, run!

09:39.412 --> 09:40.834
Consider yourself carefully.

09:54.511 --> 09:55.854
I surrender to you, sir.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.013
Get on your knees?

09:58.681 --> 09:59.773
No.

10:00.517 --> 10:01.894
Now let my sister be.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.485
Your sister?

10:05.021 --> 10:06.318
That's interesting.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.666
She's...

10:20.745 --> 10:21.746
She's bonnie.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.383
I'll take a closer look.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.129
No!

10:37.053 --> 10:38.396
Bring his head up.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.689
He wanted to send a message.

10:49.732 --> 10:52.736
This is what you get when
you fight back against the English.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.781
You care to see more?

11:30.857 --> 11:33.280
Or would you rather go into the house
and offer me better entertainment?

11:33.359 --> 11:34.531
Don't go with him.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.331
Even if he slits my throat
right before your eyes.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.675
So,

11:55.757 --> 11:57.134
she went with him.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.730
She thought he'd kill me,

12:02.805 --> 12:04.853
and perhaps she was right.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.943
After that,
I dinna ken what happened.

12:09.187 --> 12:12.407
When I woke up, I was trussed up
in the wagon with the chickens,

12:12.482 --> 12:14.234
jolting down the road
to Fort William.

12:14.859 --> 12:15.860
I'm so sorry.

12:15.944 --> 12:18.493
That must have been terrible for you.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.414
Aye.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.288
Chickens are very poor company.

12:26.996 --> 12:27.997
Don't do that.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.675
I'm going to
strap that arm to your side.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.096
Just hold still.

12:43.638 --> 12:44.639
You're a kind woman

12:45.848 --> 12:48.271
with a good touch.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.691
Your husband is a lucky man.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.207
<i>My husband.</i>

13:06.536 --> 13:08.755
<i>What was Frank going through?</i>

13:10.456 --> 13:13.630
<i>His wife disappears without a trace,</i>

13:13.710 --> 13:16.634
<i>without a word, without explanation.</i>

13:17.338 --> 13:19.432
<i>Fears would prey on him.</i>

13:19.507 --> 13:22.681
<i>Perhaps I was abducted.
Perhaps I was dead.</i>

13:22.760 --> 13:23.761
Claire?

13:23.845 --> 13:26.018
<i>Or perhaps, worst of all,</i>

13:26.097 --> 13:27.599
<i>I had left him for another man.</i>

13:27.682 --> 13:29.150
Mrs. Randall?

13:31.060 --> 13:32.903
<i>Claire!</i>

13:39.027 --> 13:41.246
Mrs. Beauchamp, what's wrong?

13:44.073 --> 13:45.325
I'm fine.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.755
I was just thinking about my husband.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.593
Lass.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.431
Is he not alive?

14:05.261 --> 14:06.729
No, actually.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.900
He's not alive.

14:20.443 --> 14:23.413
There. Do not cry.

14:24.739 --> 14:25.831
No.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.010
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.485
You need not be scared of me.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.318
Nor anyone else here,

14:58.940 --> 15:00.658
so long as I'm with ye.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.112
When you're not with me?

15:07.198 --> 15:09.826
Just never forget that you're English

15:09.909 --> 15:12.458
in a place where
that's not a pretty thing to be.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.840
Thank you. I will.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.466
Watch yourself.

15:26.217 --> 15:28.219
Now, you sleep a bit.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.895
You're worn out.

15:32.807 --> 15:36.357
Likely someone will
want to speak to you before too long.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.398
I suppose you're right.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.260
You must get up now! Come along!

16:01.377 --> 16:02.754
Up with ye!

16:06.716 --> 16:09.390
You slept the whole day.
'Tis near 5:00.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.352
Have some hot broth for ye
by the fire.

16:21.856 --> 16:22.982
Rouse yourself!

16:31.115 --> 16:32.162
Thank you.

16:47.757 --> 16:48.758
Come along.

16:55.806 --> 16:58.229
What kind of corset is that?

17:00.937 --> 17:02.280
It's a brassiere.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.026
It's from France.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.054
Good and tight.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.251
There.

17:58.494 --> 18:01.668
Now you're ready
to be taken to himself.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.529
<i>If I was going to survive,</i>

18:25.605 --> 18:28.700
<i>I needed to acclimatize myself
as quickly as possible.</i>

18:29.609 --> 18:33.113
<i>I knew where I was. But when?</i>

18:33.195 --> 18:34.492
<i>From the clothes and weapons alone,</i>

18:34.572 --> 18:37.416
<i>I knew it was most likely
the 18th century.</i>

18:43.664 --> 18:45.291
<i>1743.</i>

18:45.958 --> 18:48.632
<i>Scotland is definitely
part of Great Britain.</i>

18:48.711 --> 18:51.134
I see you've met some of my friends.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.722
Forgive me for helping myself.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.898
Some old comrades,

19:10.733 --> 19:12.827
some new acquaintances,

19:12.902 --> 19:14.870
yet to make their secrets known.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.741
But all friends nonetheless.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.371
I welcome ye, mistress.

19:20.576 --> 19:23.546
My name is
Colum Ban Campbell MacKenzie,

19:24.830 --> 19:26.127
laird of this castle.

19:27.875 --> 19:28.876
Please.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.763
<i>1743,</i>

19:36.842 --> 19:39.345
<i>decades before
the American Revolution.</i>

19:39.428 --> 19:42.398
<i>England and France are at war again.</i>

19:42.473 --> 19:45.101
<i>One of the Hanover kings
is on the throne.</i>

19:45.184 --> 19:46.936
<i>But which one?</i>

19:50.648 --> 19:54.528
It was my understanding that
my brother and his men

19:54.610 --> 19:57.955
found you in some apparent distress.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.624
"Apparent?"

20:00.700 --> 20:04.250
I was attacked and nearly raped
by one of the soldiers

20:04.328 --> 20:05.705
of King George II.

20:07.456 --> 20:10.960
And other than this near rape,

20:11.377 --> 20:14.096
you suffered no further molestation?

20:14.171 --> 20:15.172
No.

20:15.798 --> 20:19.348
Please extend my gratitude
to your brother for his kind escort.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.107
I will, of course,

20:25.182 --> 20:28.937
need to arrange transport back
to Inverness as soon as possible.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.696
I'm sure something can be arranged.

20:33.774 --> 20:36.903
But I do myself wish to know

20:36.986 --> 20:40.581
how exactly a lady such as yourself

20:40.656 --> 20:42.624
came to be wandering about
in the woods,

20:42.700 --> 20:45.044
dressed in nothing but her shift.

20:46.287 --> 20:49.006
It's interesting. I took a course
in withstanding interrogation

20:49.081 --> 20:51.425
as part of officer training,
and the basic principle was

20:51.500 --> 20:54.379
that you stick to the truth
as much as humanly possible,

20:54.462 --> 20:56.965
only altering those details
that have to be kept secret.

20:57.548 --> 21:00.927
I am a widowed lady from Oxfordshire.

21:01.010 --> 21:05.265
I was traveling with a manservant
to distant relatives in France,

21:05.347 --> 21:07.691
and we were set upon by highwaymen.

21:08.184 --> 21:10.778
While I managed to
escape the bandits,

21:10.853 --> 21:13.356
I was forced to abandon
my horse and property.

21:14.023 --> 21:16.617
While wandering through the woods,

21:16.692 --> 21:19.821
I was suddenly attacked
by Captain Jack Randall.

21:19.904 --> 21:23.033
I believe you know of him.

21:24.992 --> 21:29.088
It was during this
unpleasant encounter

21:29.163 --> 21:30.790
that I was relieved of my clothes.

21:33.334 --> 21:38.215
It's true that Captain Randall
has a certain reputation.

21:40.049 --> 21:42.393
But he is an officer. A gentleman.

21:44.637 --> 21:48.562
And you're saying that
a man bearing the king's commission

21:48.641 --> 21:53.021
decided to rape a stray lady traveler
he came upon in the woods

21:53.103 --> 21:54.150
for no good reason.

21:56.524 --> 22:01.371
Is there ever a good reason for rape,
Master MacKenzie?

22:03.489 --> 22:05.742
I beg your forgiveness, madam.

22:07.576 --> 22:10.455
An unfortunate turn of phrase
on my part.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.758
Not at all.

22:14.834 --> 22:18.589
I believe we were discussing
my transport back to Inverness.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.842
Aye.

22:22.925 --> 22:26.646
A tinker by the name of Sean Petrie,

22:26.720 --> 22:28.597
he will be here Saturday next.

22:29.515 --> 22:33.315
He stops at Leoch
on his way to Inverness once a month,

22:33.394 --> 22:36.614
and he often has room
for one or two passengers.

22:39.108 --> 22:41.987
Saturday next? Forgive me.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.530
I've lost track in all the confusion.

22:45.155 --> 22:47.624
Not at all. Five days from now.

22:52.329 --> 22:53.876
Meanwhile...

22:58.127 --> 23:01.381
I offer you
the hospitality of our humble home.

23:03.507 --> 23:04.724
Thank you.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.516
<i>Five days.</i>

23:11.599 --> 23:14.102
<i>Five days, and I would be
back on the road to Inverness,</i>

23:14.184 --> 23:16.357
<i>and then back to
the stones atop Craigh na Dun,</i>

23:17.313 --> 23:19.862
<i>and hopefully back home.</i>

23:22.234 --> 23:24.407
<i>I did know something of this era.</i>

23:24.486 --> 23:27.911
<i>The politics, the people,
their dress.</i>

23:27.990 --> 23:30.789
<i>Even some of their customs
and colloquialisms were familiar.</i>

23:32.953 --> 23:34.751
<i>But it was all secondhand knowledge,</i>

23:34.830 --> 23:37.629
<i>acquired from books,
museums, paintings.</i>

23:39.335 --> 23:41.303
<i>It was like landing on an alien world</i>

23:41.378 --> 23:44.097
<i>you'd only glimpsed
through a telescope.</i>

23:49.553 --> 23:50.850
Aye, lads.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.774
Well, two against one, hey?
That's not fair.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.396
How about two against two?

23:56.060 --> 23:57.357
Where you going?

23:57.436 --> 23:59.859
What about you?
One-on-one, come on, Hamish.

23:59.939 --> 24:00.940
Show us your moves.

24:01.023 --> 24:02.275
That's it, good lad.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.031
Very good.

24:04.652 --> 24:05.778
Very quick.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.363
Come on.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.283
You wouldna kill an unarmed man.
Oh, no!

24:11.367 --> 24:12.869
But he's not dead!

24:13.369 --> 24:15.542
I've got ye! I've got ye!

24:16.705 --> 24:18.207
<i>But then you begin to wonder</i>

24:19.041 --> 24:23.763
<i>if maybe life on this alien world
is not so different after all.</i>

25:48.756 --> 25:49.757
Allow me.

25:56.638 --> 25:57.981
Thank you.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.824
May I present my wife Letitia?

26:07.900 --> 26:12.576
Letitia, Mrs. Claire Beauchamp,
an English lady of Oxfordshire.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.031
A pleasure to meet ye.

26:14.114 --> 26:15.331
The pleasure's mine.

26:16.033 --> 26:20.038
I trust Mrs. Fitzgibbons
found you comfortable lodgings?

26:20.120 --> 26:22.214
Very. She's a wonder.

26:22.289 --> 26:25.509
The wonder is how she manages to
bake bannocks such as these

26:25.584 --> 26:28.508
with the poor ovens
we have in the kitchens.

26:41.809 --> 26:42.856
Why "Beauchamp"?

26:45.395 --> 26:46.396
I beg your pardon?

26:46.480 --> 26:50.030
I was wondering why
you call yourself Claire Beauchamp.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.946
It's my name.

26:54.029 --> 26:57.158
Aye, but if your family
hail from France,

26:57.241 --> 27:00.711
would it not be
more properly Beauchamp?

27:03.872 --> 27:05.294
Well,

27:05.374 --> 27:09.595
the ties we have to France
are old, but not close.

27:11.130 --> 27:14.304
At some point, I suspect an ancestor
decided to adopt the English style.

27:17.511 --> 27:21.061
And what part of France
do your folk come from, exactly?

27:22.933 --> 27:25.311
The relatives I have
are from the North.

27:25.394 --> 27:26.862
Near Compiègne.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.114
Compiègne.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.538
I trust Mr. MacTavish
is feeling better?

27:36.822 --> 27:37.869
Mr. MacTavish?

27:38.407 --> 27:39.533
She means young Jamie.

27:39.950 --> 27:41.793
Jamie? Why?

27:42.035 --> 27:43.582
Whatever is the matter with the lad?

27:43.662 --> 27:45.255
Naught but a scratch, my dear.

27:46.665 --> 27:47.757
Where is he though, Dougal?

27:47.875 --> 27:50.469
I sent him to the stables to help
Old Alec with the horses.

27:51.587 --> 27:52.588
The stables?

27:52.921 --> 27:55.265
Best place for him under
the circumstances.

27:55.382 --> 27:56.975
I don't want him inside the walls.

28:01.430 --> 28:02.556
But it's yours to choose,

28:04.516 --> 28:06.359
if you don't agree with my orders.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.819
I reckon he'll do well enough there.

28:12.232 --> 28:14.109
Bring us a bottle of the Rhenish.

28:20.282 --> 28:23.661
Now, you won't find this
in Oxfordshire.

28:31.084 --> 28:32.677
Are ye bound for Compiègne, then?

28:34.046 --> 28:35.343
Compiègne, yes.

28:41.929 --> 28:43.647
It's a lovely city,
wouldn't you agree?

28:46.141 --> 28:50.396
In truth, I wouldn't know,
having never been there myself.

28:50.479 --> 28:51.696
First visit?

28:54.149 --> 28:55.696
Yes.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.954
And will you be staying with family?

29:01.365 --> 29:02.662
Distant family.

29:02.741 --> 29:03.833
Never met them?

29:07.329 --> 29:10.003
No. But I look forward to it, though.

29:10.123 --> 29:12.672
A joyous occasion, I imagine.

29:15.295 --> 29:16.968
One can only hope.

29:24.554 --> 29:25.555
Hello.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.271
My name is Claire.

29:30.519 --> 29:32.521
Go on, then. Give her your name.

29:33.730 --> 29:34.731
Hamish.

29:34.815 --> 29:37.284
It's a pleasure to meet you, Hamish.

29:37.359 --> 29:40.283
I saw you playing earlier today
in the courtyard with your father.

29:40.362 --> 29:42.114
With my father?

29:42.197 --> 29:45.827
Yes, surely you remember, Dougal.
You were swinging him around.

29:59.506 --> 30:01.053
I'm sorry,

30:02.467 --> 30:04.469
I appear to have made an error.

30:04.553 --> 30:06.806
I'm the son and heir
of Colum MacKenzie.

30:06.888 --> 30:09.437
Indeed you are.

30:18.900 --> 30:23.906
I'm afraid the rigors of the past few
days have been catching up with me.

30:25.699 --> 30:27.451
If you'll excuse me,

30:29.369 --> 30:31.087
I think I shall retire early tonight.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.545
A good night to ye, then.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.132
Mrs. Beauchamp.

30:57.689 --> 30:58.690
<i>Frank would have laughed</i>

30:58.774 --> 31:01.744
<i>and said I fell for
the oldest trick in the book.</i>

31:01.818 --> 31:03.866
<i>Ply the subject with food and drink,</i>

31:03.945 --> 31:06.289
<i>but all the while
continuing the interrogation.</i>

31:07.282 --> 31:11.662
<i>I would have to be more careful if I
were to survive the next five days.</i>

31:31.973 --> 31:33.771
You've missed breakfast.

31:36.520 --> 31:37.988
Still some porridge.

31:40.190 --> 31:41.191
Warm it for ye.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.952
No, I...

31:44.403 --> 31:47.748
I was thinking I should change the
bandage on Mr. MacTavish's shoulder.

31:48.782 --> 31:49.783
Jamie.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.873
Where would I find the stables?

31:56.164 --> 31:57.165
Up at the meadow.

31:58.792 --> 32:00.135
To the East.

33:02.147 --> 33:03.148
Aye!

33:05.567 --> 33:07.911
I'm so sorry about that.

33:14.117 --> 33:17.371
She's just a girl with spirit is all.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.169
That's always a good thing.

33:22.918 --> 33:24.295
What can I do for you,
Mistress Beauchamp?

33:25.962 --> 33:27.805
It's what I can do for you.

33:27.881 --> 33:29.599
Some fresh bandages and some lunch.

33:32.427 --> 33:33.474
Aye.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.777
Quite the appetite.

33:42.687 --> 33:45.736
I should think you'd eat grass
if there was nothing else.

33:45.815 --> 33:46.816
I have.

33:47.943 --> 33:51.447
Doesna taste bad,
but it's not very filling.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.453
You've actually eaten grass?

33:57.536 --> 33:59.664
The winter.

33:59.746 --> 34:00.747
Year before last.

34:01.623 --> 34:02.966
I was living rough, you know,

34:03.041 --> 34:06.045
in the woods
wi' a group of lads, raiding cattle.

34:06.127 --> 34:10.098
We'd had poor luck
for a week and more

34:10.172 --> 34:12.426
and no food amongst us left.

34:15.762 --> 34:19.562
One might ask why you were raiding
cattle and living the life of a thief

34:19.641 --> 34:21.359
instead of tending to your own farm.

34:25.981 --> 34:27.197
There was a price on my head.

34:28.984 --> 34:30.406
£10. Sterling.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.783
A farmer's whole year in these parts.

34:37.492 --> 34:40.917
Seems excessive
for a single escaped prisoner.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.880
No, not for escape.

34:44.958 --> 34:45.958
For murder.

34:48.168 --> 34:51.389
But I didn't actually
kill the man I'm wanted for.

34:53.632 --> 34:57.058
You're a very complicated man,
Mr. MacTavish.

34:57.137 --> 34:58.184
Nay.

34:59.681 --> 35:02.104
Nay, it's a simple story, really.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.697
I told you
what happened to me at Fort William.

35:07.731 --> 35:10.405
I could hardly move for a day or two

35:10.483 --> 35:12.201
after I'd been flogged
the second time.

35:12.819 --> 35:15.163
And I had fever from the wounds.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.661
Once I could stand again, though,

35:18.992 --> 35:22.997
some friends made shift
to get me out of the camp

35:23.872 --> 35:26.796
by means I'd best not go into.

35:26.875 --> 35:30.630
And there was some ruckus as we left,

35:31.588 --> 35:33.511
and a Redcoat was shot.

35:35.884 --> 35:36.885
Not by you.

35:38.303 --> 35:39.725
To tell ye the truth,

35:40.555 --> 35:43.308
I was too weak to do more than
hang off the horse.

35:45.226 --> 35:46.523
Four years ago now.

35:47.062 --> 35:48.735
More like an old dream, but...

35:50.690 --> 35:51.737
There it is.

35:57.364 --> 35:59.537
I take it
your real name's not Mr. MacTavish.

36:00.659 --> 36:01.660
No.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.418
No, it's not.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.125
A nom de guerre, as it were.

36:09.751 --> 36:11.879
Aye. If you like.

36:14.381 --> 36:17.180
You know,
it's valuable information, that.

36:18.885 --> 36:19.886
You know,

36:21.513 --> 36:23.811
I doubt there are informers
in the castle itself,

36:23.890 --> 36:26.609
but, you know, there might be
some about the countryside

36:26.685 --> 36:28.733
be glad enough to earn a few pennies

36:28.812 --> 36:30.359
by letting the English know
where I was,

36:31.815 --> 36:34.238
did they know I was a wanted man.

36:37.737 --> 36:38.738
Does Colum know?

36:39.406 --> 36:41.124
That I'm an outlaw?

36:43.034 --> 36:44.251
Aye.

36:44.327 --> 36:46.705
Aye, Colum knows.

36:46.788 --> 36:48.131
And Dougal.

36:48.790 --> 36:51.418
But they're uncles
on my mother's side.

36:53.837 --> 36:55.464
Now I know.

36:56.965 --> 36:58.717
Why did you tell me?

37:00.218 --> 37:01.219
You asked.

37:04.597 --> 37:05.940
That's no answer.

37:07.392 --> 37:10.236
You could have lied, or told me
it was none of my business.

37:11.438 --> 37:13.236
Well, I suppose I could have.

37:13.314 --> 37:14.440
Didn't think Of that.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.695
Decided to trust ye instead.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.624
Are you done stuffing your face
while the horses run wild?

37:22.782 --> 37:24.409
And when will that colt be broken?

37:25.034 --> 37:26.707
None the sooner
for starving myself.

37:33.501 --> 37:36.630
I best be returning to work.

37:36.713 --> 37:39.091
Thank you for the food and the...

37:40.175 --> 37:42.769
Just try not to
get flogged or stabbed today.

37:42.844 --> 37:43.970
That'll be thanks enough.

37:45.054 --> 37:46.681
No promises, Sassenach.

38:02.697 --> 38:03.698
Are you following me?

38:05.617 --> 38:07.210
You are. Why?

38:13.291 --> 38:15.464
You could at least
do me the courtesy of an answer.

38:16.419 --> 38:19.389
- Did Colum tell you to follow me?
- Nah.

38:20.048 --> 38:21.049
Dougal, then?

38:22.383 --> 38:24.852
Ken, for a woman, you do
ask a fair amount of questions.

38:25.345 --> 38:26.312
So I've been told.

38:26.387 --> 38:28.264
Well, I have nae answers for ye.

38:28.348 --> 38:30.225
I am but Dougal's eyes, not his head.

38:31.392 --> 38:32.564
But let me warn ye, mistress.

38:32.644 --> 38:36.239
These eyes won't be
turning their gaze from ye

38:36.314 --> 38:38.783
until the head orders me to.

38:42.862 --> 38:44.079
It could be worse.

38:44.864 --> 38:47.117
I'll be sharing guard duty
with Angus,

38:47.408 --> 38:49.752
and you'll not be finding him
as charming as myself.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.584
He's in his cups
more than out of them,

38:52.747 --> 38:53.999
a fornicator of women,

38:54.082 --> 38:57.211
and a shagger of wee beasties
when there's no women to be found.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.339
So I suggest you enjoy me
while ye can,

39:00.421 --> 39:03.516
because you'll be yelling for me
when you feel the foul breath

39:03.591 --> 39:06.140
of that mad bastard
on the back of your neck.

39:06.761 --> 39:07.762
Lovely.

39:08.012 --> 39:10.481
Lucky for you he prefers
female creatures

39:10.557 --> 39:12.685
with the tang of the farmyard
about them.

39:13.059 --> 39:15.027
Then I'll remember
to bathe regularly.

39:15.937 --> 39:17.439
He wouldna ken what to make of that.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.030
<i>Well, clearly,
you suspect me of something,</i>

39:21.109 --> 39:22.782
or you wouldn't
have people watching me.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.364
Perhaps you'd be so kind as to
give me a notion of your suspicions,

39:25.446 --> 39:26.572
or is that too much to...

39:30.159 --> 39:32.708
I suspect you may be an English spy.

39:34.038 --> 39:36.666
A spy? Me?

39:36.833 --> 39:39.052
Ye have no told the truth
about who and what you are.

39:39.669 --> 39:41.296
Of that I'm sure.

39:42.964 --> 39:46.810
And until I am sure of ye,
I'll have you watched day and night.

39:48.094 --> 39:50.313
- Now you ken my mind.
- Very well.

39:51.764 --> 39:52.890
But I think you'll find

39:52.974 --> 39:56.399
I'll be doing very little of interest
over the next four days.

39:56.477 --> 39:58.525
I do hope your spies
give you a full report.

39:58.605 --> 40:00.232
Four days?

40:02.191 --> 40:04.114
Yes.

40:04.193 --> 40:06.742
I leave with Mr. Petrie on Saturday.

40:06.821 --> 40:08.073
Forgive me.

40:08.156 --> 40:10.124
I would've thought your brother
would have told you that.

40:11.284 --> 40:13.662
Perhaps you don't "ken" his mind.

40:21.836 --> 40:23.088
<i>For the next few days,</i>

40:23.171 --> 40:26.516
<i>I determined
to maintain a simple routine,</i>

40:26.591 --> 40:30.312
<i>both, to keep my mind occupied
while I awaited the tinker's arrival</i>

40:30.386 --> 40:35.017
<i>and to give Dougal's men nothing
of the slightest interest to report.</i>

40:42.732 --> 40:46.532
<i>Mrs. Fitz put me to work
helping harvest food for the kitchen.</i>

40:48.029 --> 40:52.375
<i>I found a quiet sense of pleasure
in touching growing things once more,</i>

40:53.159 --> 40:56.413
<i>felt the satisfaction
of helping them thrive.</i>

40:58.456 --> 40:59.457
Those kind are poison.

41:04.087 --> 41:06.556
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to laugh.

41:08.007 --> 41:11.011
I imagine it was funny
from over there.

41:11.636 --> 41:12.808
Thanks for the warning, though,

41:12.887 --> 41:15.515
but I do know
those mushrooms are poisonous.

41:15.598 --> 41:17.271
Who is it
you're planning to do away with?

41:17.976 --> 41:19.193
Your husband, perhaps?

41:19.936 --> 41:22.906
Tell me if it works,
and I'll try it on mine.

41:25.358 --> 41:26.359
Actually,

41:27.235 --> 41:30.159
now, while the caps of
these mushrooms are poisonous,

41:30.238 --> 41:33.333
you can make a powder
out of the dried fungi.

41:33.408 --> 41:37.083
It's very effective in stopping
bleeding when applied topically.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.538
Fancy that.

41:40.748 --> 41:42.466
My name is Geillis. Geillis Duncan.

41:42.542 --> 41:45.136
I'm sorry,
I should have introduced myself.

41:45.211 --> 41:47.589
- My name is...
- I know who you are, Claire.

41:47.672 --> 41:49.345
The village has been humming
with talk of ye

41:49.424 --> 41:50.767
since you came to the castle.

41:53.386 --> 41:54.854
What is it they're saying about me?

41:55.555 --> 41:57.774
That you're likely a Sassenach spy.

42:11.112 --> 42:14.286
You know, those will start bleeding

42:15.366 --> 42:17.994
to get rid of a child you don't want.

42:18.077 --> 42:19.579
Brings on your flux.

42:19.662 --> 42:21.505
But only if you use it early.

42:22.081 --> 42:26.507
Too late, and it can kill you
as well as the child.

42:27.628 --> 42:32.008
The girls in the village come to me
every now and again for such things.

42:33.551 --> 42:34.723
They say I'm a witch.

42:35.803 --> 42:36.804
Are you?

42:38.473 --> 42:39.645
Hardly.

42:41.434 --> 42:43.402
Although I am aware of

42:43.478 --> 42:47.654
how wood betony
can transform toads into pigeons.

42:52.820 --> 42:56.700
You should come visit me sometime
down in the village.

42:56.783 --> 42:58.956
I have a cabinet
full of potions and medicinals

42:59.035 --> 43:02.084
I wager would tickle yer fancy.

43:02.163 --> 43:04.541
But I hope
I'll see you tonight at the hall.

43:04.624 --> 43:06.342
The hall?

43:14.967 --> 43:16.594
<i>After a week's observation</i>

43:16.677 --> 43:20.102
<i>I diagnosed Colum's condition
as Toulouse-Lautrec syndrome.</i>

43:22.850 --> 43:25.228
<i>Named for its most famous sufferer,</i>

43:25.311 --> 43:27.814
<i>who did not yet exist,
I reminded myself,</i>

43:28.689 --> 43:32.034
<i>it was a degenerative disease
of bone and connective tissue.</i>

43:39.200 --> 43:41.123
<i>Lautrec died at 38,</i>

43:41.327 --> 43:44.206
<i>and given the state of medicine
in the 18th century,</i>

43:44.831 --> 43:48.005
<i>Colum MacKenzie was most certainly
living on borrowed time.</i>

43:51.254 --> 43:54.884
Masters William Talbot
and Fingal Duncan,

43:54.966 --> 43:57.185
will ye stand forth?

44:03.391 --> 44:05.735
They're neighbors.

44:05.810 --> 44:07.403
Having a dispute over a cow.

44:08.563 --> 44:09.564
A cow?

44:23.035 --> 44:24.036
He says...

44:24.412 --> 44:26.039
Well, let me see.

44:26.122 --> 44:27.669
It's all right.

44:27.748 --> 44:29.500
I have the feeling something
would be lost in translation.

44:29.584 --> 44:32.884
Kyle Ferguson,
step forward and present yourself.

44:42.263 --> 44:44.265
They're fighting over some property.

45:07.330 --> 45:10.675
Her father accuses her
of loose behavior.

45:17.548 --> 45:21.473
Her father wishes the MacKenzie to
have her punished for disobedience.

45:47.161 --> 45:48.378
No.

46:18.609 --> 46:20.828
He's offering to
take the girl's punishment.

46:20.903 --> 46:22.246
What?

46:22.571 --> 46:24.790
But he's still injured.

46:30.746 --> 46:32.373
They're arguing it now.

46:56.314 --> 46:58.487
He allows it.

47:08.868 --> 47:10.916
He chooses fists.

47:10.995 --> 47:12.338
Fists?

47:12.413 --> 47:14.711
Rather than the strap.

47:16.959 --> 47:20.008
If ye'd wanted a beating,
I'd been happy to oblige ye.

47:20.087 --> 47:23.341
Aye, but you might have done
some real damage.

47:23.424 --> 47:26.894
Watch yourself, laddie.
Your uncle is up to something.

48:23.567 --> 48:25.114
How long must this go on for?

48:25.194 --> 48:27.196
Only until bloods drawn.

48:27.279 --> 48:29.782
Usually when their nose is broken.

48:37.790 --> 48:39.838
This is barbarous.

49:23.711 --> 49:25.384
Claire, stay here.

50:24.605 --> 50:27.825
This way is quicker,
and you'll stir less gossip.

50:34.949 --> 50:36.041
Here.

50:38.077 --> 50:39.078
Why did you do that?

50:40.079 --> 50:41.797
Take that girl's punishment?

50:43.290 --> 50:44.883
Do you know her?

50:48.837 --> 50:49.963
Ken who she is.

50:51.674 --> 50:54.393
Haven't really spoken to her, though.

50:55.219 --> 50:56.471
Then why?

50:59.014 --> 51:01.733
It would have shamed the mass

51:01.809 --> 51:04.653
to have been beaten in the hall
before everyone that knows her.

51:04.728 --> 51:06.776
Taken a long time to get over it.

51:08.023 --> 51:10.401
It's easier for me.

51:10.484 --> 51:13.658
I'm sore, but I'm nae really damaged.

51:14.572 --> 51:16.199
I'll get over it in a couple days.

51:18.659 --> 51:19.831
Here ye are, lad.

51:20.286 --> 51:21.754
Rinse your mouth with this.

51:22.663 --> 51:24.961
It'll cleanse the cuts
and ease the pain.

51:25.666 --> 51:26.918
Willow bark tea.

51:27.167 --> 51:28.669
Bit of ground orris root.

51:28.752 --> 51:30.004
Ground up well.

51:31.338 --> 51:32.385
Top of life.

51:33.799 --> 51:35.676
What ye did was kindly meant, lad.

51:38.679 --> 51:40.647
Laoghaire is my granddaughter,
ye ken?

51:51.609 --> 51:55.785
Take that bandage off your shoulder
in the next two days.

51:55.863 --> 51:57.536
Would it not be easier
if you did that?

51:57.615 --> 52:00.118
Yes, but I'll be gone.

52:01.076 --> 52:03.704
I'm leaving with Mr. Petrie tomorrow.

52:07.374 --> 52:08.375
I see.

52:12.212 --> 52:13.384
Well...

52:16.050 --> 52:18.724
Then perhaps this is good-bye.

52:20.387 --> 52:21.388
Yes.

52:26.393 --> 52:29.613
I think someone
would like to speak with you alone.

52:30.272 --> 52:31.273
Aye.

52:34.985 --> 52:36.202
Well, goodbye to you, then, Jamie.

52:37.946 --> 52:40.870
Safe journeys to ye, Claire.

53:02.137 --> 53:04.231
The bannocks
should last a day or two,

53:04.306 --> 53:06.354
and the cheese will keep for a week.

53:06.433 --> 53:08.652
You've been too kind,
Mrs. Fitzgibbons.

53:08.727 --> 53:11.606
- I can't thank you enough.
- Think nothing o' it, lass.

53:15.275 --> 53:17.323
Safe journey to ye.

53:23.617 --> 53:25.961
- Colum wishes to see ye.
- Why?

53:27.538 --> 53:28.790
It doesna matter why.

53:31.625 --> 53:32.626
All right.

53:34.044 --> 53:35.170
I'll be back in a minute.

53:54.690 --> 53:56.237
Oh, come on.

53:57.025 --> 53:59.244
Three, two, one...

53:59.653 --> 54:00.825
Something wrong?

54:02.322 --> 54:03.323
No.

54:37.649 --> 54:39.026
Good day to ye, Mrs. Beauchamp.

54:39.443 --> 54:40.615
Good day.

54:40.694 --> 54:44.415
Ye have no connections
with clan Beaton, have ye?

54:45.991 --> 54:47.789
The Beatons? No.

54:47.993 --> 54:51.463
The healers of clan Beaten
are famous through the highlands.

54:51.538 --> 54:53.961
We had one here,

54:54.041 --> 54:57.466
until he caught a fever
which carried him off within a week.

54:57.544 --> 54:59.342
Davie Beaton was his name.

55:00.714 --> 55:03.843
And this was his surgery,
he called it.

55:04.384 --> 55:05.601
Really?

55:10.265 --> 55:11.733
All this,

55:11.809 --> 55:13.937
and no one to share it with?

55:24.196 --> 55:28.747
I understand you have quite
some skill as a healer yourself.

55:28.826 --> 55:30.248
It's an interest of mine, yes.

55:34.248 --> 55:36.717
You know the uses
of these potions and things?

55:37.501 --> 55:39.674
Some.

55:39.753 --> 55:42.302
This is all really fascinating.

55:42.381 --> 55:44.008
Thank you for showing me.

55:44.091 --> 55:45.684
But I must be going.

55:45.759 --> 55:49.935
Seeing as we have not had a healer
since Davie passed,

55:50.556 --> 55:52.854
I want you to take up the work.

55:54.101 --> 55:55.102
But I'm leaving.

55:56.562 --> 55:58.690
No. You're staying.

56:03.694 --> 56:04.991
What did Dougal say to you?

56:05.070 --> 56:07.914
Did one of his thugs
make up lies about me?

56:09.658 --> 56:11.786
My brother keeps
his own counsel on you.

56:12.578 --> 56:14.751
This is my decision.

56:14.830 --> 56:16.173
Then why am I staying?

56:16.248 --> 56:18.967
Because it is my pleasure
that you do so.

56:19.668 --> 56:21.466
Because you think I'm a spy.

56:22.254 --> 56:25.224
Surely you don't believe that.

56:25.299 --> 56:29.224
I believe that you have secrets,
Claire.

56:29.303 --> 56:32.557
Now, maybe they're the kind of
secrets that every woman has,

56:32.639 --> 56:37.236
which pose no threat to me,
to Leoch, or to clan MacKenzie.

56:37.311 --> 56:40.235
But until I know for sure,

56:40.314 --> 56:42.487
you will remain here,

56:43.734 --> 56:45.156
as my guest.

56:52.910 --> 56:55.504
You mean as your prisoner, don't you?

57:01.835 --> 57:03.837
Only if you try to leave.

57:06.800 --> 57:14.800
