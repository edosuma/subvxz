38:50.806 --> 38:52.678
-WHAT? I WROTE YOU A NOTE.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.810
-I KNOW.
IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.

38:59.511 --> 39:01.382
-NOW THIS IS KINKY.

39:08.389 --> 39:10.173
-YOU OKAY?
-YES.

39:23.317 --> 39:24.753
2-HEY, HOBIE.
-HEY.

39:24.927 --> 39:25.928
WHERE'S YOUR DAD?

39:26.102 --> 39:27.408
-HE WENT DOWN ON THE BEACH.

39:27.582 --> 39:28.975
SAID HE HAD TO GO
TALK TO DR. TAYLOR.

39:49.778 --> 39:52.172
-SPOT ANYTHING
UNUSUAL OUT THERE?

39:53.216 --> 39:54.566
-ACTUALLY, YES.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.916
THERE WAS AN UNUSUALLY
LARGE GROUP OF DOLPHINS

39:57.090 --> 39:58.657
CIRCLING YOUR SHORE.

39:59.484 --> 40:01.660
THEY'RE VERY
SENSITIVE CREATURES.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.402
-SO ARE CHILDREN.

40:06.447 --> 40:09.276
-YOUR SON BELIEVES
IN POSSIBILITIES,
MR. BUCHANNON.

40:09.450 --> 40:11.234
MOST CHILDREN DO.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.846
THE SHAME IS
MOST ADULTS DON'T.

40:15.717 --> 40:17.763
-WHAT MAKES YOU
SUCH A BELIEVER?

40:18.764 --> 40:19.939
-I DON'T KNOW.

40:20.113 --> 40:21.462
I USED TO THINK
IT WAS ALL THE DATA,

40:21.636 --> 40:23.029
ALL THE FACTS
I'D COLLECTED.

40:23.203 --> 40:26.119
BUT IT'S DEEPER THAN THAT.

40:27.512 --> 40:30.340
I'D RATHER BELIEVE IN MY HEART
THAT THERE'S SOMEONE OUT THERE

40:30.515 --> 40:33.213
THAT MIGHT HELP GET
THIS PLANET BACK ON COURSE

40:33.387 --> 40:35.650
THEN BELIEVE
THAT THERE ISN'T.

40:37.826 --> 40:38.827
-WHAT IF--

40:39.828 --> 40:41.221
-WHAT IF THAT
SOMEONE OUT THERE

40:41.395 --> 40:43.528
REALLY DOESN'T GIVE
A DAMN ABOUT US?

40:44.137 --> 40:46.705
AND WHAT IF THEY'RE
REALLY INTO IT
FOR THEMSELVES?

40:47.923 --> 40:51.057
-THEN WE SHOULD DEFINITELY
FIND THAT OUT, SHOULDN'T WE?

40:54.364 --> 40:56.366
-ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANT
ANY HOT CHOCOLATE?

40:57.063 --> 40:59.457
-LOOK.
-[THUNDER]

41:25.395 --> 41:26.658
-WHAT WAS THAT?

41:29.878 --> 41:31.445
-WHERE'D DR. TAYLOR GO?

41:46.547 --> 41:49.550
[THUNDER]

41:50.246 --> 41:51.552
WHOA.

42:03.869 --> 42:06.436
