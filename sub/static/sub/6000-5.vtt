<i>Previously on "Finding Carter"...</i>

00:01.919 --> 00:04.163
Dad, I feel like you're not
telling me something.

00:04.164 --> 00:05.172
I had a one-night stand.

00:05.173 --> 00:06.733
<i>It was the biggest
mistake of my life.</i>

00:06.734 --> 00:08.509
- Carter, this is Hillary.
- Hi.

00:08.510 --> 00:10.144
I'm your dad's teaching
assistant.

00:10.979 --> 00:12.324
<i>Max and I are done.</i>

00:14.389 --> 00:16.096
Your father and I are
separating.

00:26.184 --> 00:27.128
Hey.

00:27.129 --> 00:28.489
Gabe, is...

00:28.490 --> 00:30.656
Is that Carter?

00:30.657 --> 00:31.664
I think so.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.344
Wait, you still
go to school here?

00:33.880 --> 00:35.113
Funny.

00:35.114 --> 00:36.458
You guys should do standup.

00:36.459 --> 00:38.074
We heard about
what happened with Lori

00:38.075 --> 00:39.817
and we were just
trying to cheer you up.

00:39.818 --> 00:41.001
- You okay?
- I'm not gonna lie,

00:41.002 --> 00:42.529
it's been a rough few days.

00:42.830 --> 00:44.713
In fact, the only reason
I'm here is because the new

00:44.714 --> 00:47.829
guidance counselor has insisted
that I come in for some

00:47.830 --> 00:50.558
face-to-face time
with my parents.

00:51.749 --> 00:53.317
Have you guys met this woman?

00:53.318 --> 00:54.292
Abby.

00:54.703 --> 00:56.491
She's a serious hard-ass.

00:56.492 --> 00:58.924
But her ass is seriously hard.

00:59.877 --> 01:01.709
- Well played, it is. Great.
- Yeah.

01:01.710 --> 01:02.901
- Well, I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

01:03.295 --> 01:04.516
- See ya.
- Bye.

01:07.550 --> 01:09.134
Hey, where have you been?
You're late.

01:09.135 --> 01:10.389
By, like, three minutes.

01:10.390 --> 01:11.650
Do we know what
this meeting is about?

01:11.651 --> 01:12.937
Something about my future.

01:12.938 --> 01:13.921
That sounds positive.

01:15.009 --> 01:16.057
- Elizabeth?
- Yes.

01:16.058 --> 01:18.793
Abby, this is my husband David.

01:18.794 --> 01:21.500
Hello. And you must be Carter.

01:21.501 --> 01:23.043
I must be.

01:23.044 --> 01:24.408
- Shall we get started?
- Yes.

01:24.917 --> 01:25.584
Okay.

01:25.585 --> 01:26.848
<i>According to our records,</i>

01:26.849 --> 01:29.263
Carter's missed nine days
of school this month,

01:29.264 --> 01:31.462
ten last month.

01:31.835 --> 01:33.209
- Ten days?
- We had no idea.

01:33.210 --> 01:35.623
On top of that, her GPA
has been sliding each quarter.

01:35.624 --> 01:37.796
- It's now a 2.4.
- 2.4?

01:37.797 --> 01:40.265
If Carter keeps this up she may
have to repeat her junior year

01:40.266 --> 01:43.252
or she could be kicked out
for chronic truancy.

01:44.104 --> 01:44.936
Okay.

01:46.144 --> 01:48.536
Yes, I fully admit that school

01:48.537 --> 01:51.580
hasn't been the biggest
priority for me recently,

01:51.912 --> 01:53.688
but that could have
something to do with the fact

01:53.689 --> 01:55.712
that I just committed
the woman who raised me

01:55.713 --> 01:57.848
to a mental institution.

01:57.849 --> 02:00.056
I just returned home
after being kidnapped

02:00.057 --> 02:03.231
for the second time
in my 17 years on this planet,

02:03.232 --> 02:04.808
so how about you
all just give me

02:04.809 --> 02:05.992
a little bit of a break?

02:05.993 --> 02:08.431
Sweetheart, you've been
through a lot, we get that.

02:08.433 --> 02:09.632
But school is important.

02:09.633 --> 02:11.284
What can we do to help you?

02:11.285 --> 02:12.820
I don't need help,
really, I'm fine.

02:12.821 --> 02:15.115
You've had a rough time,
but maybe if you think about

02:15.116 --> 02:16.748
letting it stop,
try to look forward.

02:16.749 --> 02:19.228
We all want to help you succeed.
Now, are you planning

02:19.229 --> 02:21.476
on taking your college
aptitude test tomorrow?

02:21.477 --> 02:24.284
Was it something I put
down in my calendar? No.

02:24.285 --> 02:26.564
These scores are
vital to your future.

02:26.565 --> 02:27.891
The higher your score,

02:27.892 --> 02:30.296
the more opportunities
you'll have for college.

02:30.297 --> 02:32.096
The sooner you take them,
the more chances

02:32.097 --> 02:34.188
you'll have
to increase your score.

02:35.768 --> 02:39.055
Well, I want to thank you
all for your time

02:39.056 --> 02:40.896
and your concern.

02:42.127 --> 02:43.744
Consider your message received.

02:45.360 --> 02:46.752
Loud and clear.

03:18.734 --> 03:22.033
Sync and corrections by biamussolin
www.addic7ed.com

03:22.382 --> 03:23.890
- So you just left?
- Yeah.

03:23.891 --> 03:25.633
All three of them
were just standing there

03:25.634 --> 03:27.442
going through my file like
I was on trial or something.

03:27.443 --> 03:30.945
Now they are insisting that
I take the SATs tomorrow.

03:30.946 --> 03:31.993
Those monsters.

03:31.994 --> 03:33.673
Whose side are you on, Crash?

03:33.674 --> 03:34.865
Come on, they're just
looking out for you.

03:34.866 --> 03:36.797
Yeah, okay, but I really
don't need them to.

03:37.249 --> 03:39.888
You know, okay, for all of
Lori's faults,

03:39.889 --> 03:41.833
and believe me, there are many,

03:43.433 --> 03:45.437
she never got on my case
about school.

03:46.313 --> 03:49.614
She just trusted me
enough to leave me alone

03:49.615 --> 03:51.598
and let me figure
stuff out for myself.

03:53.405 --> 03:54.653
Miss.

03:54.654 --> 03:56.253
This employee bothering you?

03:56.254 --> 03:58.031
No. I was just, um, talking...

03:59.098 --> 04:00.656
- What?
- He's kidding.

04:00.657 --> 04:01.722
This is my uncle Shane.

04:02.524 --> 04:03.802
It's nice to finally meet you.

04:03.803 --> 04:05.515
- I'm Carter.
- Nice to meet you, too.

04:05.516 --> 04:07.004
Thank you for everything
you did for Crash.

04:07.005 --> 04:08.003
Hey.

04:08.004 --> 04:09.395
Crash is family.

04:09.396 --> 04:10.858
Never turn your back on family.

04:11.159 --> 04:12.795
And don't forget,
we need this turnaround by 2:00.

04:12.796 --> 04:14.587
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.535
See you again soon, I hope.

04:15.536 --> 04:17.678
Yeah, definitely. Bye.

04:18.430 --> 04:19.744
See? Why can't any of the adults

04:19.745 --> 04:21.344
in my family be that cool?

04:23.376 --> 04:25.368
I think I have a way
to turn your day around.

04:25.369 --> 04:26.608
- How?
- I'm gonna take you out tonight.

04:26.609 --> 04:28.522
- What, on, like, a date?
- Yes, an actual date

04:28.523 --> 04:30.084
in a nice restaurant
with tablecloths

04:30.085 --> 04:32.804
and waiters, menus that don't
have pictures of food on them.

04:32.805 --> 04:34.285
You don't have to do that.

04:34.286 --> 04:35.708
I want to.

04:36.182 --> 04:37.476
Okay.

04:41.076 --> 04:42.157
So.

04:42.158 --> 04:44.404
How'd you discover this room?

04:44.405 --> 04:47.048
I was a library monitor
last year,

04:47.049 --> 04:49.689
so I know every nook
and cranny of this place.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.472
No one ever set foot

04:51.473 --> 04:53.529
in the Russian literature
section, not once.

04:54.681 --> 04:56.104
Well, this was fun.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.936
Should we do something
again after lunch?

04:59.937 --> 05:02.240
You know, we've hooked up
five times this week,

05:02.241 --> 05:03.948
and each time you take off
the second it's over.

05:03.949 --> 05:05.747
- What's the rush?
- Well, at this moment,

05:05.748 --> 05:08.699
I have exactly four
minutes to get to pre-Calc

05:09.200 --> 05:11.715
and I thought that
this was just a...

05:12.880 --> 05:16.503
Friends with benefits
type thing situation.

05:16.504 --> 05:17.759
Doesn't have to be.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.463
Why don't you come to the fair
with me tonight?

05:19.464 --> 05:21.798
- Misterwives is playing.
- I don't know. SATs are tomorrow.

05:21.799 --> 05:25.122
I was just gonna go home and do
some last-minute cramming.

05:25.123 --> 05:26.242
You've been cramming for months.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.089
You're ready.

05:27.090 --> 05:28.626
Let me present this to you

05:28.627 --> 05:30.799
in a way you can
better understand.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.381
Do you want to go
to the fair with me?

05:32.382 --> 05:33.428
"A," not at all,

05:33.429 --> 05:34.596
"B," not sure,

05:34.597 --> 05:36.291
"C," a little,

05:36.292 --> 05:39.659
"D," a lot.

05:42.803 --> 05:44.299
Um...

05:45.000 --> 05:46.227
"C"?

05:46.228 --> 05:47.316
"C."

05:47.317 --> 05:48.594
I can work with that.

05:51.271 --> 05:53.126
Okay, looks like
your half of the bills

05:53.127 --> 05:56.607
- comes to 537.12.
- Really?

05:56.608 --> 05:58.832
Well, I think I'm gonna be
a little short this month.

05:58.833 --> 06:01.609
Short as in, like,
can you spot me a fiver, or...

06:01.610 --> 06:03.378
Or a couple C-notes.

06:03.379 --> 06:04.930
Sorry.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.242
I wasn't anticipating my grandma

06:06.243 --> 06:08.187
being so rigid with
the monthly allowance.

06:08.188 --> 06:10.074
She's trying to get me to
come and live with her

06:10.075 --> 06:11.826
and she thinks the big
squeeze will do it.

06:11.827 --> 06:13.554
Can you just cover me
and I'll pay you back?

06:13.555 --> 06:15.282
Bird, you know I'd be
up for that totally.

06:15.283 --> 06:16.906
You've been really great
about letting me stay here.

06:16.907 --> 06:18.657
I just... truth is, I just...

06:18.658 --> 06:20.146
I don't make enough
to cover us both.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.338
Money management.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.414
It's never really been
my strong suit.

06:23.415 --> 06:25.958
No worries, you have other
stellar qualities.

06:25.959 --> 06:27.974
But if we're gonna keep
the lights on around here,

06:27.975 --> 06:30.654
you're gonna maybe need
to cut back on entertaining.

06:30.655 --> 06:31.861
Yeah, I guess.

06:31.862 --> 06:34.053
Except the people
have grown to expect

06:34.054 --> 06:35.333
certain amenities from me.

06:35.334 --> 06:37.806
What am I supposed to do?
Go all Marie Antoinette on them?

06:37.807 --> 06:40.089
No, no, nobody's asking you
to lose your head.

06:40.090 --> 06:42.897
I'm just asking you
to keep it on straight.

06:49.987 --> 06:51.930
Hey, do you have any lip gloss?

06:51.931 --> 06:53.554
Whoa! Hot date?

06:53.555 --> 06:54.722
Lukewarm.

06:54.723 --> 06:56.750
Yeah, it's in the top drawer.

06:57.351 --> 06:58.753
So?

06:58.754 --> 06:59.824
Who's the lucky guy?

07:01.345 --> 07:02.146
Ofe.

07:02.147 --> 07:03.282
Ofe?

07:03.883 --> 07:05.254
Wow, I did not see that coming.

07:05.255 --> 07:06.382
Me neither.

07:07.686 --> 07:10.422
- I kinda like it, though.
- Yeah, I think I kinda like it, too.

07:11.823 --> 07:12.974
What's all this?

07:14.544 --> 07:16.622
I also have a date tonight.

07:16.623 --> 07:18.572
Cool. Anyone I know?

07:20.212 --> 07:22.170
- Wow.
- Taylor, he's not the same guy anymore.

07:22.171 --> 07:23.308
To me, he is.

07:24.908 --> 07:26.108
Okay.

07:29.075 --> 07:30.523
You should go with that one.

07:30.524 --> 07:33.079
Brings out your eyes.

07:40.936 --> 07:42.676
What is this?

07:51.971 --> 07:53.925
Can you please just
forget you saw that?

07:53.926 --> 07:55.238
No, I don't think I can.

07:55.239 --> 07:56.557
Where did you get this?

07:56.558 --> 07:57.822
Lori gave it to me.

07:57.823 --> 07:59.942
Why does she have
a picture of our dad?

07:59.943 --> 08:01.590
To prove that she
had an affair with him.

08:01.591 --> 08:04.422
That woman is so crazy.

08:05.165 --> 08:07.558
Does she really expect us
to believe that...

08:11.433 --> 08:13.161
Well, it isn't true, is it?

08:15.881 --> 08:17.649
This is why mom and dad
are separating?

08:17.650 --> 08:19.730
Tay, I think it's better
if you ask them these questions.

08:19.731 --> 08:21.138
No, I'm asking you.

08:21.139 --> 08:23.466
Yeah, and I'm saying, I think
it's better if you ask them.

08:23.467 --> 08:24.802
Fine, I will.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.994
Is it true?

08:34.995 --> 08:36.378
Where'd you get that?

08:36.379 --> 08:37.898
She found it in my room.

08:39.140 --> 08:40.674
- Is what true?
- Did you have an affair with Lori?

08:40.674 --> 08:42.506
- Did he what?
- Taylor, this is not the time.

08:42.508 --> 08:44.955
- It's a yes or no question, dad.
- This is an adult conversation

08:44.956 --> 08:47.242
- that I'm not open to having right now.
- Why not?

08:47.243 --> 08:48.834
Because not everything
your mother and I deal with

08:48.835 --> 08:51.315
in our personal lives
is your business.

08:51.316 --> 08:53.323
How is you sleeping
with Carter's kidnapper

08:53.324 --> 08:54.491
not my business?

08:54.492 --> 08:55.582
Taylor, that's enough.

08:55.583 --> 08:57.414
This conversation is over.

09:00.150 --> 09:01.742
Anything you'd like to say?

09:07.823 --> 09:09.982
It's true.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.711
- I knew it.
- It happened a long time ago.

09:12.712 --> 09:14.703
It was a couple of years
before Carter was kidnapped.

09:14.704 --> 09:16.583
I am so sorry, Taylor,
we should have told you.

09:16.584 --> 09:18.879
You thought that Carter could
handle it but we couldn't?

09:18.880 --> 09:20.791
They didn't tell me.
I found out by myself.

09:20.792 --> 09:22.375
Like that somehow
makes it better?

09:22.376 --> 09:23.961
We're sisters.
You should have told me.

09:23.962 --> 09:25.985
Yeah, it would have been
nice if you told me, too.

09:25.986 --> 09:27.272
I promised them I wouldn't.

09:27.273 --> 09:28.888
'Cause that would be,
what, the first time

09:28.889 --> 09:30.232
you broke a promise
to our parents?

09:30.233 --> 09:32.112
Taylor, we were just
trying to protect you.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.268
Well, I don't know who to be
more mad at, you guys or Lori,

09:34.269 --> 09:37.305
who somehow still manages
to screw up my life,

09:37.306 --> 09:38.601
even from jail.

09:38.602 --> 09:39.904
I'm out of here.

09:39.905 --> 09:40.688
Where are you going?

09:40.689 --> 09:41.864
The fair. Don't wait up.

09:41.865 --> 09:43.145
Taylor.

09:43.146 --> 09:44.698
Can I come, too?

09:44.699 --> 09:46.081
Sure. Why not?

09:46.082 --> 09:47.528
Enjoy your date.

09:54.648 --> 09:58.920
Study date with Bird.
For the SATs tomorrow.

10:08.334 --> 10:09.332
Hey.

10:09.333 --> 10:11.053
Hey. Okay if he tags along?

10:11.054 --> 10:12.924
I know it's probably not
what you had in mind.

10:12.925 --> 10:14.349
No problem at all. Hey, buddy.

10:16.902 --> 10:17.876
You okay?

10:17.877 --> 10:18.893
All good.

10:20.476 --> 10:22.044
You ready for some fun,
little man?

10:23.389 --> 10:24.900
Okay.

10:30.450 --> 10:31.920
We agreed we wouldn't
say anything.

10:31.921 --> 10:34.567
- I know.
- So why'd you do it?

10:34.568 --> 10:36.454
Because I hated seeing
Taylor so upset.

10:36.455 --> 10:38.079
Or because you couldn't
pass up an opportunity

10:38.080 --> 10:39.454
to make me look like a bad guy.

10:39.455 --> 10:42.516
David, they got past my affair with Kyle,
they'll get past this, too.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.138
Are you trying to turn
the kids against me?

10:44.139 --> 10:45.817
- Is that what this is about?
- What are you talking about?

10:45.818 --> 10:46.802
Why would I do that?

10:46.803 --> 10:48.413
Because we don't know where
we'll stand when the dust

10:48.414 --> 10:49.437
settles on this separation.

10:49.438 --> 10:51.670
For all I know, you're...
You're plotting.

10:51.671 --> 10:52.830
Plotting?

10:52.831 --> 10:54.558
Yeah, trying to get
the kids to pick sides,

10:54.559 --> 10:56.630
in case in the end, you know.

10:56.631 --> 10:59.370
David, I am still pulling to
make this marriage work.

10:59.971 --> 11:01.127
And you find that funny?

11:01.128 --> 11:03.060
- Hilarious, actually.
- Why?

11:03.061 --> 11:05.867
Because from where I'm standing,
only one of us is pulling for

11:05.868 --> 11:07.400
this marriage to work
and it's me.

11:15.707 --> 11:16.612
Hi.

11:16.613 --> 11:17.796
Is David in?

11:24.884 --> 11:27.305
Maybe your date would
like to weigh in on this.

11:32.094 --> 11:34.198
I'm sorry, are we seeing other people now?

11:34.199 --> 11:37.847
Hillary and I are just friends,
we are not seeing each other,

11:37.848 --> 11:40.485
- unlike you and Kyle.
- What are you talking about now?

11:40.486 --> 11:42.797
Grant told me he saw
the two of you kissing.

11:44.334 --> 11:45.806
- That's not true.
- So Grant's lying?

11:45.807 --> 11:48.910
No, what happened was,
Kyle tried to kiss me - and I stopped it.

11:48.911 --> 11:50.758
If you want to see other people,
just say so.

11:50.759 --> 11:52.680
I'm not the one
with the date in the next room.

11:52.681 --> 11:55.136
We are going for a friendly drink.
It's not a date.

11:55.137 --> 11:57.373
Well, if you want it
to be, please don't let me stop you.

11:57.374 --> 11:59.140
So you do think we should
see other people.

11:59.141 --> 12:00.909
No, what I think is you're
afraid to tell me

12:00.910 --> 12:02.396
that you want
to see other people.

12:02.397 --> 12:06.128
Excuse me, I'm so sorry,
I couldn't help but overhear.

12:07.108 --> 12:08.092
I think I'm just gonna go.

12:08.093 --> 12:09.245
No, please...

12:09.246 --> 12:10.852
I'm sorry, could you
hang on a second?

12:10.853 --> 12:13.588
Well, it sounds like you two are
having difficulty communicating.

12:13.589 --> 12:14.772
How can you tell?

12:14.773 --> 12:16.656
I was a psychology minor.

12:26.220 --> 12:28.704
Maybe seeing other people
isn't the worst idea.

12:34.568 --> 12:36.137
Well, now we're communicating.

12:37.105 --> 12:38.473
So, yeah.

12:38.474 --> 12:40.336
Business is going really well,

12:40.337 --> 12:41.840
Shane's already
looking to expand,

12:41.841 --> 12:42.753
open up a few more shops.

12:42.754 --> 12:44.336
He's teaching me how
the whole operation works.

12:44.337 --> 12:45.904
In a few years,
I should be able to

12:45.905 --> 12:47.840
move up from
mechanic to manager.

12:48.488 --> 12:49.568
Wow.

12:49.569 --> 12:52.336
I never heard you sound,
so, um...

12:53.684 --> 12:55.024
Mature. Nice.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.028
Mature may be a stretch,

12:56.029 --> 12:57.476
but for the first time
in my life,

12:57.477 --> 12:58.836
I feel like I...

13:00.787 --> 13:01.749
I'm gonna be okay.

13:01.750 --> 13:03.885
I'm not gonna screw
everything up, you know?

13:03.886 --> 13:05.517
What about you?

13:06.965 --> 13:08.084
You feeling any better?

13:08.085 --> 13:09.340
Not really a bit.

13:10.533 --> 13:11.972
Well, don't worry.
Dinner is just phase one.

13:11.973 --> 13:13.788
I got a whole phase
two planned out.

13:13.789 --> 13:14.645
What's phase two?

13:14.646 --> 13:15.581
It's a surprise.

13:15.582 --> 13:16.540
Okay, I don't mean to offend,

13:16.541 --> 13:19.190
but the last thing I need
in my life right now

13:19.191 --> 13:20.487
is another surprise.

13:20.488 --> 13:21.872
- Can you just tell me?
- Okay.

13:21.873 --> 13:23.504
We're going to the County Fair.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.320
You want to go to a County Fair?

13:26.321 --> 13:27.912
What?
I can appreciate a good fair.

13:27.913 --> 13:31.434
I'm shocked you would want to participate
in such a wholesome G-rated activity.

13:31.435 --> 13:34.096
But who said it
had to be G-rated?

13:34.097 --> 13:36.209
Crash, what are you doing?

14:16.116 --> 14:18.075
Okay, let's go
check out the ghost tent.

14:18.076 --> 14:19.491
- Want to smoke? Mhm.
- Yes.

14:22.059 --> 14:24.043
I'll just stay here,
while you guys talk.

14:24.044 --> 14:25.204
Hey.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.207
Tay, you've barely said
a word to me all evening.

14:30.243 --> 14:31.588
Why start now?

14:33.155 --> 14:34.116
All right.

14:34.117 --> 14:35.660
Just so I'm clear,

14:38.196 --> 14:39.432
our parents are getting
separated for something

14:39.433 --> 14:42.320
that happened, like,
15 years ago.

14:44.759 --> 14:46.983
Yeah, it doesn't make a whole
lot of sense to me, either.

14:47.484 --> 14:49.487
Nothing in this
family ever does.

15:03.353 --> 15:04.624
Hey, Abby.

15:04.625 --> 15:06.657
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Abby.

15:06.658 --> 15:07.654
What are you doing here?

15:07.655 --> 15:10.332
Even I can
appreciate a good County Fair.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.383
- Yeah, that's what I said.
- Everyone feeling ready for tomorrow?

15:12.384 --> 15:13.148
Ready-ish.

15:13.464 --> 15:15.773
Abby, what's your professional
opinion on guessing versus

15:15.774 --> 15:17.653
skipping questions
you don't know the answers to?

15:17.654 --> 15:19.145
I hear that it's
actually better to skip.

15:19.146 --> 15:20.273
I hear you're better
off guessing.

15:20.274 --> 15:22.115
If you're gonna guess,
the correct answer

15:22.116 --> 15:23.115
is almost never the letter "D."

15:23.116 --> 15:24.570
What about the essays?
'Cause I hear that

15:24.571 --> 15:26.387
short essays actually score
higher than long essays.

15:26.388 --> 15:28.196
Don't get caught up in all that.

15:28.197 --> 15:30.114
There's no secret formula
for beating the test.

15:30.115 --> 15:32.460
Just... do your best.

15:32.461 --> 15:34.306
Well, as long as I
get a high enough score

15:34.307 --> 15:35.524
to get into a good art school,

15:35.525 --> 15:36.883
I'll be happy.

15:36.884 --> 15:38.724
Well, I need to kick ass
if I'm gonna have a shot

15:38.725 --> 15:39.667
at an athletic scholarship.

15:41.332 --> 15:42.139
Okay, you know what?

15:42.140 --> 15:43.635
We're We're gonna get some food.

15:47.920 --> 15:48.775
Sorry.

15:48.776 --> 15:50.439
Just needed to get away
from that conversation.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.119
- And that woman.
- Who was she?

15:52.120 --> 15:53.622
That was Abby.

15:53.623 --> 15:56.046
The new guidance counselor
I was telling you about.

15:57.182 --> 15:58.490
She doesn't seem so bad.

15:59.719 --> 16:02.032
She's got everybody brainwashed
about the SATs tomorrow.

16:02.033 --> 16:04.268
Did you decide whether
or not you're taking them?

16:05.568 --> 16:07.171
- No, mom, I didn't.
- Just asking.

16:07.172 --> 16:09.064
Okay, well, I'm just
trying to enjoy tonight

16:09.065 --> 16:10.510
and not worry about tomorrow.

16:11.111 --> 16:13.223
Gee, if only you were
able to talk to someone

16:13.224 --> 16:14.855
who could look into the future

16:14.856 --> 16:16.755
and tell you what
was gonna happen.

16:17.256 --> 16:18.443
We are not doing that.

16:18.444 --> 16:19.835
We are so doing that.

16:19.836 --> 16:21.123
Let's go.

16:21.124 --> 16:22.308
Let's do it.

16:38.167 --> 16:39.550
Grant?

16:42.070 --> 16:43.375
I thought that was you.

16:43.376 --> 16:44.791
Reagan.

16:44.792 --> 16:46.246
Hey.

16:47.438 --> 16:50.107
Funny running in... to you here.

16:50.108 --> 16:51.259
I know, right?

16:53.547 --> 16:55.274
I can't believe we're finally
meeting in person.

16:55.275 --> 16:56.450
Talking face to face.

16:56.451 --> 16:57.388
Instead of on Skype.

16:57.389 --> 16:59.035
It was bound to
happen eventually.

16:59.987 --> 17:00.843
So...

17:02.507 --> 17:04.426
What's up, girlfriend?

17:04.428 --> 17:06.050
Since we skyped this afternoon?

17:06.051 --> 17:07.377
Not much.

17:09.307 --> 17:10.643
Cool.

17:12.426 --> 17:13.395
Hey.
How about instead of talking,

17:13.396 --> 17:17.075
we just go to separate corners
and... facetime each other?

17:17.076 --> 17:18.423
Yeah, it'll be like old times.

17:21.967 --> 17:24.646
- So, having fun?
- Yeah, you?

17:25.823 --> 17:27.391
Interesting.

17:27.392 --> 17:29.135
Very, very interesting.

17:29.136 --> 17:30.971
Seriously?

17:30.972 --> 17:32.331
Just go with it.

17:32.332 --> 17:33.731
You have a sister?

17:35.634 --> 17:36.491
Yeah.

17:36.492 --> 17:37.643
And two brothers, right?

17:37.644 --> 17:38.851
Nope. Just one.

17:38.852 --> 17:40.162
Close, though.

17:41.563 --> 17:44.595
So everything that I'm seeing
here for you is really good.

17:45.651 --> 17:47.466
This is the king of wands card.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.155
It says you're career-driven
and goal-oriented.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.379
The page of pentacles says
you're a good student

17:52.380 --> 17:53.650
with a commitment to learning.

17:53.651 --> 17:56.867
The queen of wands says you'll
achieve happiness and success

17:56.868 --> 17:58.783
in all aspects of your career.

17:59.851 --> 18:01.047
God.

18:01.048 --> 18:02.446
Okay, I can't read your energy

18:02.447 --> 18:04.651
unless you're fully open
to this experience.

18:04.652 --> 18:06.915
I'm sorry, but, are you kidding?

18:06.916 --> 18:07.703
- Carter...
- What?

18:07.704 --> 18:09.351
Come on, she probably
gives the same reading

18:09.352 --> 18:10.343
to everyone who comes in here.

18:10.344 --> 18:11.687
- No, I...
- Here's a question.

18:11.688 --> 18:13.959
How come everything you
hear from a tarot reader

18:13.960 --> 18:14.983
is a good thing?

18:14.984 --> 18:17.302
Is all the energy off
of <i> every</i> single person

18:17.303 --> 18:18.510
who comes in here positive

18:18.511 --> 18:20.774
or do you ever, like,
have to give the bad news?

18:20.775 --> 18:22.967
You know, like this card says

18:22.968 --> 18:24.239
you're not gonna
graduate college

18:24.240 --> 18:27.295
and this card says
you're destined to end up

18:27.296 --> 18:28.951
working a crappy
minimum wage job

18:28.952 --> 18:30.611
for the rest of your
life and this card

18:30.612 --> 18:33.170
says you're gonna get 740
on your SATs tomorrow,

18:33.171 --> 18:34.769
so why even bother taking them?

18:37.241 --> 18:38.365
Sorry.

18:38.966 --> 18:40.329
You didn't even let her finish.

18:40.330 --> 18:42.085
Yeah, I'd heard enough.

18:42.729 --> 18:43.632
Hey.

18:43.633 --> 18:44.937
Come on.

18:44.938 --> 18:46.177
Why are you taking
this so seriously?

18:46.178 --> 18:47.897
- It's supposed to be fun.
- Yeah, really fun

18:47.898 --> 18:49.809
that everyone in my life
except me has a plan,

18:49.810 --> 18:51.155
including you.

18:51.156 --> 18:54.899
I wish I could go five minutes
without being reminded of it.

19:02.620 --> 19:03.444
Okay.

19:04.899 --> 19:06.373
Statistically,
between the two of us,

19:06.374 --> 19:07.845
one of these should have
landed already.

19:07.846 --> 19:09.404
This game is rigged.

19:11.977 --> 19:12.968
You sure you're okay?

19:12.969 --> 19:14.737
Yeah. I told you, I'm fine.

19:14.738 --> 19:15.904
- Why?
- I don't know.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.360
It just seems like
something's on your mind.

19:17.361 --> 19:18.552
Just...

19:19.360 --> 19:20.706
Stupid family stuff.

19:20.707 --> 19:22.105
You know how it is.

19:23.624 --> 19:24.756
Actually, I don't.

19:24.757 --> 19:26.439
I grew up in a totally
normal home,

19:27.105 --> 19:28.676
with two dads
who love each other.

19:29.557 --> 19:32.228
No kidnappings,
no lies, no drama.

19:32.229 --> 19:33.732
My family has no stuff,

19:33.733 --> 19:36.941
but I'd love to be the guy
you can talk to about yours.

19:36.942 --> 19:37.772
I don't want to talk.

19:38.286 --> 19:39.068
I want to win.

19:50.671 --> 19:52.160
Absolutely no way.

19:52.161 --> 19:53.776
No way, dude, are you kidding?

19:53.777 --> 19:55.712
No, I'm not kidding.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.223
You actually think you can get
Abby to go for you.

19:59.224 --> 20:00.711
Yeah, I do.

20:00.712 --> 20:02.048
I'm serious.

20:02.049 --> 20:03.687
There's a real connection there.

20:03.688 --> 20:05.512
Okay, even I won't
go down the teacher route.

20:05.513 --> 20:06.848
It only leads to trouble.

20:06.849 --> 20:08.488
All I ever do is study
and go to practice.

20:08.489 --> 20:10.328
Maybe I could
use a little trouble.

20:10.329 --> 20:11.736
You're the best, Bird.

20:11.737 --> 20:12.875
You rock, Bird.

20:12.876 --> 20:13.752
Thanks, Bird.

20:13.753 --> 20:15.020
No need. It's my pleasure.

20:16.572 --> 20:17.963
Do I even want to ask?

20:18.915 --> 20:20.691
Relax, okay, I just

20:20.692 --> 20:22.299
bought out the bumper cars
for the next hour.

20:22.300 --> 20:23.700
Bird, where did you
get the money for that?

20:23.701 --> 20:25.475
I squeezed a little extra
out of my grandparents.

20:25.476 --> 20:27.059
Okay, okay, but what
about our bills?

20:27.060 --> 20:28.707
We need that money
to eat and live.

20:28.708 --> 20:29.659
We're gonna be on the street.

20:29.660 --> 20:31.556
My God, it only
cost a few hundred bucks.

20:31.557 --> 20:33.348
Why do you have
to be so dramatic?

20:33.349 --> 20:35.107
Why do you have to think that
you won't have any friends

20:35.108 --> 20:36.675
unless you buy them?

20:46.664 --> 20:47.607
Whoa, check this one out.

20:49.488 --> 20:50.687
Nice.

20:52.959 --> 20:54.159
Tell me.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.567
If I put on some weight...

20:59.311 --> 21:00.370
Reagan, where'd you go?

21:05.513 --> 21:06.617
Reagan?

21:12.129 --> 21:15.013
- I was like, might want to adjust that.
- Wow, that's really embarrassing.

21:16.129 --> 21:16.986
Hey, Abby.

21:16.987 --> 21:18.500
- Hey, Carter.
- Look, could you just

21:18.501 --> 21:20.276
do me a favor and stay away
from the guy I'm seeing?

21:20.277 --> 21:22.964
When you talk trash to my parents
about me is humiliating enough.

21:23.980 --> 21:25.556
No, she wasn't
doing that, Carter.

21:25.557 --> 21:27.672
I started up
a conversation with her.

21:29.173 --> 21:30.061
- Why?
- He was just telling me

21:30.062 --> 21:31.381
how great he thinks you are.

21:31.382 --> 21:33.933
And even though you may not
have it all figured out,

21:33.934 --> 21:35.517
you're the smartest
person he knows

21:35.518 --> 21:37.125
and I shouldn't worry about you.

21:37.126 --> 21:39.458
- Did I miss anything?
- No, that's...

21:39.459 --> 21:40.509
That's pretty much it.

21:40.510 --> 21:42.202
All right.

21:42.203 --> 21:43.657
It's Shane, I gotta take this.

21:46.409 --> 21:47.361
Sorry.

21:47.362 --> 21:48.457
That's okay.

21:49.297 --> 21:51.753
Getting yelled at by students is
pretty much a daily occurrence.

21:51.754 --> 21:52.994
I'm used to it.

21:54.106 --> 21:56.930
So, I saw one of my
test prep books

21:56.931 --> 21:59.649
in the garbage outside
of my office.

21:59.650 --> 22:02.250
I'm not gonna be seeing
you tomorrow, am I?

22:02.251 --> 22:03.713
I wouldn't hold your breath.

22:03.714 --> 22:06.417
You know, if Crash was able
to let go of his past,

22:06.418 --> 22:08.521
and turn his life around,

22:08.522 --> 22:10.058
especially with everything
he's been through,

22:10.059 --> 22:12.134
it seems like you could, too.

22:30.287 --> 22:31.349
Hey.

22:32.861 --> 22:34.150
- Where'd you go?
- Where did I go?

22:34.151 --> 22:35.510
Where did you go?

22:36.509 --> 22:37.822
Sorry. I kept walking,

22:37.823 --> 22:39.733
- I thought you were right behind me.
- Well, I wasn't.

22:39.734 --> 22:41.581
Maybe you should pay closer
attention next time.

22:44.733 --> 22:46.181
Okay, well.

22:46.564 --> 22:48.485
I should probably be
getting back to my family.

22:49.670 --> 22:51.262
Good seeing you.

22:52.197 --> 22:53.381
Yeah.

23:05.154 --> 23:06.817
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:07.994 --> 23:09.041
You having fun?

23:09.042 --> 23:10.290
Yeah, you?

23:10.291 --> 23:11.594
Yeah, a blast.

23:13.161 --> 23:14.713
Something's bothering you,
I can tell.

23:14.714 --> 23:16.585
It's funny, I can tell there's
something bothering you, too.

23:17.922 --> 23:19.833
Maybe we're
psychically connected.

23:19.834 --> 23:21.234
Maybe.

23:21.235 --> 23:22.505
What number am I thinking of?

23:22.906 --> 23:24.129
17.

23:24.130 --> 23:25.306
46.

23:25.307 --> 23:26.587
Damn it.

23:26.588 --> 23:27.858
Well.

23:27.859 --> 23:29.173
We tried.

23:29.174 --> 23:30.454
You want to talk
about whatever it is?

23:30.455 --> 23:31.862
No, I'll be fine.

23:35.325 --> 23:36.678
Tell me what's
going on with you.

23:38.445 --> 23:40.070
Well.

23:41.030 --> 23:43.197
My dad had an affair with Lori.

23:43.198 --> 23:44.725
Whoa.

23:44.726 --> 23:46.037
Yeah.

23:46.038 --> 23:47.773
A few years before
she took Carter.

23:47.774 --> 23:49.958
That's why my parents
are separating.

23:50.934 --> 23:53.006
So that's what's
going on with me.

23:53.007 --> 23:54.261
Are you okay?

23:54.262 --> 23:56.646
Well, at first
I was mad at everyone

23:56.647 --> 23:58.545
for keeping me in
the dark about it,

24:00.181 --> 24:03.157
but truthfully,
I'm glad that they did,

24:03.762 --> 24:06.585
because now that I know,
I wish that I didn't.

24:06.586 --> 24:10.186
I think that in the back of my
mind, I was holding on to some

24:10.187 --> 24:11.481
stupid fantasy that my parents

24:11.482 --> 24:13.529
might actually
end up back together.

24:15.889 --> 24:17.874
Now it just seems hopeless.

24:17.875 --> 24:20.138
I have to disagree.

24:20.480 --> 24:21.551
- Why?
- I mean, they've already

24:21.552 --> 24:24.907
been through so much together.
I'm sure they can get through this, too.

24:24.908 --> 24:26.343
I don't know.

24:26.344 --> 24:27.759
This is pretty bad.

24:29.126 --> 24:30.591
Have a little faith.

24:31.895 --> 24:33.271
Thanks.

24:34.871 --> 24:37.935
You're still the only person
I can talk to about any of this.

24:37.936 --> 24:39.947
I'm glad to be of service.

24:40.248 --> 24:41.429
Hey.

24:41.430 --> 24:43.020
Max, I need a favor.

24:43.021 --> 24:44.644
Shane just called.

24:44.645 --> 24:47.356
He's got a job he wants me
to do tonight, but I...

24:47.357 --> 24:50.404
I really don't want
to bail on Carter.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.077
Is there any chance
you could do it?

24:52.078 --> 24:53.100
It's easy money.

24:53.101 --> 24:54.244
It pays 200 bucks.

24:55.044 --> 24:55.924
Yeah.

24:55.925 --> 24:57.844
Yeah, dude, I can
definitely use 200 bucks.

24:57.845 --> 24:59.108
Dude, you're a lifesaver.

24:59.109 --> 25:00.371
Come on, I'll give
you the details.

25:00.372 --> 25:01.477
All right.

25:01.478 --> 25:03.588
- Bye, Taylor.
- Bye.

25:15.197 --> 25:16.331
- Hey.
- Hey, you won.

25:16.332 --> 25:18.277
No, not exactly.

25:18.278 --> 25:20.621
I traded it for some product.

25:20.622 --> 25:22.541
It'll cut into
this week's profits,

25:22.542 --> 25:24.654
but I really wanted you
to have it.

25:31.589 --> 25:33.349
I should have got you
the Sabertooth, right?

25:33.350 --> 25:34.605
I know you wanted
the Sabertooth.

25:34.606 --> 25:35.958
No, no, no, no, no, no.

25:36.838 --> 25:38.197
It's fine.

25:38.198 --> 25:39.662
It's fine.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.381
I love it.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.635
So I have to ask.

25:51.636 --> 25:53.172
I thought you might.

25:53.173 --> 25:54.393
The other day,

25:54.394 --> 25:56.927
I tried to kiss you
and you shot me down,

25:57.912 --> 25:59.160
but then tonight,

25:59.161 --> 26:02.360
you ask me over and here
we are on your couch making out.

26:04.344 --> 26:05.288
What changed?

26:07.156 --> 26:10.100
David and I decided to see other
people during our separation.

26:10.101 --> 26:10.914
And whose idea was that?

26:10.915 --> 26:12.129
- Does it matter?
- A little.

26:14.649 --> 26:15.546
Kyle, the truth is,

26:15.547 --> 26:18.105
I don't know why I'm doing
anything right now.

26:18.106 --> 26:19.850
I'm just trying to
make it through the day.

26:19.851 --> 26:21.658
- I get that.
- But...

26:21.659 --> 26:23.362
I know I wanted to see you

26:23.363 --> 26:24.827
and I'm glad you're here.

26:34.839 --> 26:35.949
Carter's here.

26:37.693 --> 26:39.733
- I thought you had the place to yourself.
- Yeah, so did I.

26:43.349 --> 26:44.945
Okay!

26:44.946 --> 26:46.540
So I'm guessing the kids
don't know about

26:46.541 --> 26:47.981
your new arrangement
with David yet.

26:47.982 --> 26:50.072
No, and I want to keep it
that way, so I'll call you.

26:50.073 --> 26:51.080
Okay.

26:52.912 --> 26:54.773
Hey, how was your study session?

26:54.774 --> 26:55.881
Fine.

26:55.882 --> 26:58.489
Carter. Freeze.

26:58.490 --> 26:59.802
What?

26:59.803 --> 27:02.208
- Have you been drinking?
- A little, yeah.

27:02.209 --> 27:03.999
How do you expect
to remember anything tonight?

27:04.000 --> 27:05.271
I wasn't studying.

27:05.272 --> 27:06.495
Okay.

27:07.423 --> 27:08.342
Where were you?

27:08.343 --> 27:09.855
I was with Crash.

27:09.856 --> 27:11.311
Please tell me you're joking.

27:13.155 --> 27:14.075
Nope, not joking.

27:14.076 --> 27:15.403
Why would you let him
back in your life?

27:15.404 --> 27:17.131
You mean the guy
Abby thinks so highly of?

27:17.132 --> 27:19.891
Yeah, we ran into your buddy at
the County Fair, and guess what?

27:19.892 --> 27:21.724
She loves Crash.

27:22.738 --> 27:24.036
Thinks he's a really great guy.

27:24.037 --> 27:26.699
In fact, she told me she thinks
I should be more like him.

27:26.700 --> 27:27.923
I don't understand.

27:27.924 --> 27:30.811
Why are you determined to blow
your entire future?

27:30.812 --> 27:32.426
What future?

27:34.274 --> 27:35.883
Don't you get it?

27:35.884 --> 27:38.852
College was never
in the plan for me.

27:39.763 --> 27:41.655
Lori never even mentioned it.

27:43.790 --> 27:47.075
But now I'm supposed to take
this test tomorrow,

27:47.863 --> 27:49.447
this really important test,

27:51.047 --> 27:53.215
so that I can get some score,

27:53.216 --> 27:54.902
some number,

27:55.803 --> 27:57.022
which will essentially determine

27:57.023 --> 27:59.696
what the rest of my
entire life looks like,

28:01.526 --> 28:02.696
and that's...

28:02.697 --> 28:06.303
You know, that's great if you
have absolutely any idea what

28:06.304 --> 28:08.391
the hell you want the rest of
your life to look like,

28:08.392 --> 28:11.491
but I just don't,
and I can't take it.

28:19.123 --> 28:21.779
I'm not exactly sure what I'm
supposed to say right now to you

28:21.780 --> 28:25.371
I never had this conversation
with Grant or Taylor.

28:25.372 --> 28:28.218
I feel like if I push too hard,

28:28.219 --> 28:29.595
you're just gonna push back

28:29.596 --> 28:32.267
and I'm afraid if I don't push
hard enough, then...

28:33.195 --> 28:34.410
I'm Lori.

28:37.363 --> 28:39.875
You're a lot of things,
but you're not Lori.

28:42.872 --> 28:44.463
I just wish that you wouldn't

28:44.464 --> 28:46.566
put so much pressure
on yourself.

28:46.567 --> 28:52.567
You don't have to figure out your
entire life at age 17, baby.

28:53.856 --> 28:56.534
Why don't you just take
the test tomorrow,

28:56.535 --> 29:00.207
see what happens
and you have nothing to lose.

29:00.208 --> 29:01.319
Because I'll bomb it.

29:01.320 --> 29:02.567
Okay, so you know what?

29:02.568 --> 29:03.839
Bomb it.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.851
Bomb it big, okay?

29:05.852 --> 29:07.382
And then you take it again.

29:07.383 --> 29:10.754
I'll help you
and Taylor will help you.

29:10.755 --> 29:13.496
Your whole family is behind you.

29:16.443 --> 29:19.051
You don't have to go
through this alone.

29:26.739 --> 29:27.883
You probably just want me
to go to college

29:27.884 --> 29:30.946
so you can have me out
of the house for four years.

29:30.947 --> 29:32.938
Well, that's definitely a perk.

29:35.355 --> 29:36.571
Thank you.

30:07.391 --> 30:08.671
I am telling you, that guy Dean

30:08.672 --> 30:10.598
falls asleep in every
one of your classes.

30:10.599 --> 30:11.635
Come on, every class?

30:11.636 --> 30:13.075
15 minutes in. Like clockwork.

30:13.076 --> 30:14.347
How have I not noticed this?

30:14.348 --> 30:16.539
Well, he made sure to sit behind
the largest person he can find

30:16.540 --> 30:18.215
and then he pulls
his cap down...

30:18.216 --> 30:19.847
And here I was thinking
I was becoming

30:19.848 --> 30:21.252
a pretty good teacher.

30:21.253 --> 30:22.523
You are a good teacher.

30:24.579 --> 30:25.971
You're a great teacher.

30:27.299 --> 30:30.236
Well, you're a great
teaching assistant.

30:42.350 --> 30:43.807
I shouldn't have done that.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.999
Why not? I've been wanting
you to all night.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.455
I'm still married to Elizabeth.

30:50.956 --> 30:52.443
Well, technically,

30:52.744 --> 30:54.150
you're separated,

30:55.655 --> 30:56.503
and correct me if I'm wrong,

30:56.504 --> 30:59.200
but I did hear Elizabeth
say that she thinks

30:59.201 --> 31:00.631
you both should
see other people.

31:00.632 --> 31:01.559
I know.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.719
Look, David, I like you.

31:05.943 --> 31:07.603
You're sweet, you're smart,

31:08.140 --> 31:09.314
but I don't... I don't want to...

31:09.315 --> 31:11.939
I don't want to break up
your marriage either.

31:11.940 --> 31:13.746
I'm in no rush here.

31:15.075 --> 31:16.739
So why don't we just
take things slow

31:16.740 --> 31:19.923
and we'll see what happens.

31:19.924 --> 31:21.883
- Deal?
- Deal.

31:29.189 --> 31:30.533
I'm really sorry
for what I said.

31:30.534 --> 31:32.269
Don't be.

31:34.470 --> 31:36.070
You're right.

31:38.357 --> 31:42.012
I spend money on people
because if I don't,

31:42.013 --> 31:44.606
I'm afraid they'll
want nothing to do with me.

31:44.907 --> 31:46.477
Why would you think that?

31:46.778 --> 31:49.549
Well, that's the only reason
people put up with my parents,

31:49.550 --> 31:52.361
so why would I be any different?

31:54.777 --> 31:57.433
Because you're
talented and funny.

31:57.734 --> 31:59.601
The life of the party, Bird.

31:59.602 --> 32:01.321
Hell, you are the party.

32:02.222 --> 32:06.093
Even if you stopped
being everybody's ATM,

32:06.094 --> 32:08.389
they're still gonna
be crazy about you.

32:09.829 --> 32:11.173
You're sweet.

32:14.749 --> 32:16.133
All right, I gotta get to work.

32:16.134 --> 32:18.405
Thank you for taking
this job last minute.

32:18.406 --> 32:20.325
It's not like I really
had a choice.

32:21.669 --> 32:24.125
Somebody spent all of our
rent money on bumper cars.

32:34.554 --> 32:36.465
What are you doing here?
I thought it was mom's night.

32:36.466 --> 32:37.985
I wanted to talk to you.

32:37.986 --> 32:39.056
Okay.

32:39.057 --> 32:40.425
Talk.

32:48.449 --> 32:50.809
I'm sorry for not telling
you what happened

32:50.810 --> 32:52.289
between Lori and me.

32:54.034 --> 32:55.424
I should have.

32:58.329 --> 33:01.245
So if there's anything
you want to know,

33:01.246 --> 33:03.425
ask me and I'll tell you.

33:08.509 --> 33:10.045
Did you love her?

33:10.955 --> 33:12.628
No.

33:12.629 --> 33:14.669
How long did it last?

33:14.670 --> 33:16.517
One night.

33:17.685 --> 33:20.037
Then I realized my mistake

33:20.038 --> 33:22.013
and it never happened again.

33:23.325 --> 33:24.629
Why'd you do it?

33:24.630 --> 33:28.085
Your mom and I were having
issues at home.

33:28.486 --> 33:30.665
Lori was my way

33:30.666 --> 33:32.537
to avoid dealing with them,

33:32.538 --> 33:35.057
using a physical relationship

33:35.058 --> 33:37.177
to hide from your problems.

33:37.178 --> 33:39.865
I hope you never
have to experience that.

33:39.866 --> 33:42.136
It only makes them worse.

33:48.074 --> 33:49.481
Anything else?

33:49.482 --> 33:51.040
No.

33:51.041 --> 33:53.145
I'll let you get back.

34:48.002 --> 34:50.456
Make sure to lock this
place up extra tight.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.728
No problem.

35:39.113 --> 35:40.489
You're here early.

35:40.490 --> 35:41.649
I left my computer.

35:41.650 --> 35:43.154
I thought I'd grab a coffee.

35:48.458 --> 35:50.114
How was your friendly drink?

35:54.650 --> 35:56.129
It was fine.

35:56.130 --> 35:57.578
How was your night?

36:00.049 --> 36:01.941
Uneventful.

36:03.959 --> 36:06.192
I did have a nice
heart-to-heart with Carter.

36:06.493 --> 36:07.202
Really?

36:07.203 --> 36:09.012
Yeah, I think I finally
got through to her.

36:09.013 --> 36:11.018
- That's fantastic.
- She's beginning to understand

36:11.019 --> 36:12.706
the importance
of a good education.

36:26.509 --> 36:28.890
You gotta be kidding me.

36:32.214 --> 36:33.478
Good morning, Bird.

36:33.479 --> 36:34.775
Is it?

36:34.776 --> 36:35.951
I don't remember the last time

36:35.952 --> 36:38.094
I was up this
early on a Saturday.

36:42.016 --> 36:43.046
Hey, Max, what's up?

36:44.935 --> 36:46.014
I'm fine.

36:46.015 --> 36:47.374
Thanks for asking.

36:47.375 --> 36:49.862
And thanks again for last night.

36:49.863 --> 36:51.590
I honestly don't know

36:51.591 --> 36:54.110
what I would do without
you in my life.

36:54.111 --> 36:56.383
You are never moving out, ever.

36:57.750 --> 36:58.862
Hey.

36:58.863 --> 37:00.363
Hey.

37:02.659 --> 37:04.594
So I was thinking,

37:04.595 --> 37:07.459
the test doesn't start
for another 30 minutes.

37:07.460 --> 37:11.218
Any interest in checking out
some Russian literature?

37:11.219 --> 37:13.348
Yeah. I could...

37:13.349 --> 37:15.519
I could use a little
brush up on my Tolstoy.

37:25.820 --> 37:27.315
Are you okay?

37:27.316 --> 37:29.303
You seem kind of far away.

37:30.725 --> 37:32.208
No, I'm fine.

37:32.209 --> 37:33.871
I'm right here.

37:41.514 --> 37:43.135
A through G is
over here to the right.

37:45.815 --> 37:47.536
- Hey, Abby.
- Hi, Gabe. Good seeing you last night.

37:47.537 --> 37:49.644
It's good seeing you
any time of day.

37:49.645 --> 37:51.052
You know,
I couldn't help but notice

37:51.053 --> 37:52.595
you were flying solo
at the fair.

37:52.596 --> 37:53.547
No boyfriend?

37:53.548 --> 37:55.635
I am not discussing
my personal life with you.

37:55.636 --> 37:57.011
I discuss my personal
life with you.

37:57.012 --> 37:58.595
- That's different.
- Why?

37:58.596 --> 38:00.054
I'm your guidance counselor.

38:03.117 --> 38:06.078
Well, even guidance counselors
need guidance from time to time.

38:09.741 --> 38:11.910
Your table's that way,
Mr. Materos.

38:13.101 --> 38:14.214
Thank you, Ms. Baker.

38:18.535 --> 38:20.182
- Elizabeth. Hey.
- Hey.

38:20.183 --> 38:22.311
I thought we were
on the same side, Abby.

38:22.312 --> 38:23.459
- Excuse me?
- Carter told me

38:23.460 --> 38:24.907
that you met
her ex-boyfriend Crash

38:24.908 --> 38:26.503
and you thought
he was a great guy.

38:26.504 --> 38:28.476
- I do think he's a great guy.
- Well, you're wrong.

38:28.477 --> 38:30.065
You came all the way down here
to tell me that?

38:30.066 --> 38:32.733
Yes, I did. Because he's a criminal
and we need to work together

38:32.734 --> 38:34.453
to keep him out of
Carter's life.

38:34.454 --> 38:36.477
He's a terrible
influence on her.

38:40.398 --> 38:42.077
Are you sure about that?

38:52.603 --> 38:53.426
- Here.
- What's this?

38:53.427 --> 38:55.760
I put together a little
SAT care package.

38:56.888 --> 38:58.488
It's number two pencils,

38:58.489 --> 39:00.929
pencil sharpener, extra erasers,

39:00.930 --> 39:03.544
a calculator, a banana
and an energy drink.

39:04.135 --> 39:05.144
Thank you.

39:07.192 --> 39:09.433
I'm gonna need
all the help I can get.

39:13.313 --> 39:14.792
You nervous?

39:16.978 --> 39:18.661
I just think about Lori.

39:20.231 --> 39:21.569
What about her?

39:22.644 --> 39:25.600
Not once did she ever
ask to see a report card.

39:26.201 --> 39:28.300
Never asked about homework.

39:28.301 --> 39:31.156
Didn't really care
if I cut class.

39:34.060 --> 39:35.504
I don't know,

39:35.505 --> 39:38.965
maybe she wasn't just being
a cool mom after all.

39:40.712 --> 39:41.904
Maybe she just
didn't care whether

39:41.905 --> 39:43.760
I did well or not in school.

39:43.761 --> 39:45.175
Why wouldn't she want that?

39:45.176 --> 39:47.944
Because if I went off to
college, she'd be all alone.

39:49.928 --> 39:51.624
That'd be pretty messed up
if that were true.

39:51.625 --> 39:52.959
Right.

39:52.960 --> 39:55.311
But who's more
messed up than Lori?

39:58.448 --> 40:00.372
Anyway, thank you.

40:21.340 --> 40:22.924
Where the hell have you been?

40:24.637 --> 40:25.532
With Carter, what's up?

40:25.533 --> 40:27.147
How about you tell me?

40:28.796 --> 40:29.675
Is something wrong?

40:29.676 --> 40:30.836
Yeah.

40:30.837 --> 40:32.316
Something is.

40:32.317 --> 40:33.784
You set me up.

40:33.785 --> 40:35.504
Set you up how?

40:35.805 --> 40:38.412
The car you had
dropped off last night?

40:39.369 --> 40:40.327
What about it?

40:40.328 --> 40:41.968
Are you really gonna stand there
and pretend you didn't

40:41.969 --> 40:44.364
know that it
was filled with coke?

www.addic7ed.com

40:59.898 --> 41:00.628
You set me up.

41:00.629 --> 41:01.731
I'm not that guy anymore.

41:01.732 --> 41:02.844
Tell them, Carter.

41:03.508 --> 41:04.548
Really?

41:04.549 --> 41:05.964
Crash left you to die.

41:06.265 --> 41:07.240
Police!

41:07.541 --> 41:08.572
Taylor?

41:09.776 --> 41:11.025
He's gone.
