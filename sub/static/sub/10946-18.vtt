00:00.280 --> 00:01.593
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.613 --> 00:03.949
You Ty Borden?

00:03.983 --> 00:05.217
- Yeah.
- You're under arrest

00:05.251 --> 00:06.718
for the assault
of Jesse Stanton.

00:08.587 --> 00:10.455
When I was a little girl,

00:10.489 --> 00:12.524
I always used to imagine
what my wedding would be like.

00:12.558 --> 00:14.258
I even told my mom that

00:14.293 --> 00:16.328
I was gonna ride Sugarfoot
down the aisle.

00:16.361 --> 00:17.729
Georgie, we know
that you saw us kissing.

00:17.763 --> 00:19.964
But just because
those feelings are there

00:19.998 --> 00:22.133
doesn't necessarily mean that
we're getting back together.

00:23.568 --> 00:25.669
What is your problem?!

00:25.704 --> 00:28.372
So what if you were abandoned?!
Who cares?! Get over it!

00:28.406 --> 00:30.308
Jesse's dropping the charges.

00:30.342 --> 00:31.825
- Let's get married!
- What?

00:31.845 --> 00:33.845
This is our moment. I don't
wanna wait another minute!

00:33.879 --> 00:36.147
They're eloping.

00:36.181 --> 00:38.915
All right
then, let's begin.

01:04.175 --> 01:07.143
Hey! Look who's finally awake!

01:07.178 --> 01:08.979
I haven't slept like that
in weeks.

01:11.349 --> 01:13.583
- Thanks for making tea.
- No problem.

01:13.617 --> 01:15.141
There's bacon and eggs
keeping warm in the oven

01:15.161 --> 01:16.386
if you want some.

01:16.420 --> 01:18.521
Can I expect this every morning?

01:24.862 --> 01:26.629
It's so quiet here.

01:26.663 --> 01:29.905
I know. I wish we could
just stay here forever.

01:35.305 --> 01:38.359
We should probably call Lou.

01:39.442 --> 01:40.236
Yeah.

01:40.256 --> 01:42.827
It was the right decision, right?

01:43.813 --> 01:45.386
It was the right decision.

01:52.720 --> 01:55.724
This is so completely
selfish and-and unfair of them

01:55.758 --> 01:57.426
to leave me hanging like this.

01:57.460 --> 01:59.828
Well, it's not totally
about you.

01:59.862 --> 02:02.463
Wha-really, Peter? You know what?
It-it kinda is.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.033
Because I'm the one who's gonna
have to cancel the arena,

02:05.067 --> 02:06.668
and the flowers, and the food.

02:06.688 --> 02:08.169
Oh! And, let's not forget,

02:08.203 --> 02:10.972
call each of the guests
personally.

02:11.006 --> 02:12.974
I should've seen this coming.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.809
I think, you know what?
Actually, I did.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.972
I saw this coming. You know, even
before Ty's assault charges!

02:17.992 --> 02:20.147
Peter, be honest with me.

02:20.181 --> 02:22.249
Is even a small part
of this my fault?

02:22.283 --> 02:25.697
I mean, did I...
Did I push Amy too hard?

02:25.717 --> 02:27.241
Okay. don't answer that.

02:27.261 --> 02:29.191
Look, I know you're supposed to
fly out to Vancouver tonight,

02:29.211 --> 02:31.124
but... are you gonna go?

02:31.159 --> 02:33.961
I mean, just considering
everything that's...

02:33.995 --> 02:36.463
No. It's canceled already.

02:36.497 --> 02:38.031
I'm gonna stick around
until this all settled.

02:38.066 --> 02:41.381
Thank you.
I... I appreciate that.

02:42.172 --> 02:44.541
So what time did the guys
leave this morning?

02:44.561 --> 02:46.606
Oh, like before dawn.

02:48.576 --> 02:51.511
Yeah. No cell
reception out here.

02:51.545 --> 02:53.546
Guess we'll have to call Lou
when we're on the road.

02:53.581 --> 02:56.015
Sometimes the
reception's better outside.

02:56.049 --> 02:58.317
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

03:01.489 --> 03:03.022
Well, maybe I
should go outside then.

03:06.927 --> 03:09.536
Yeah, yeah, coming.

03:12.809 --> 03:15.134
- Hey!
- Good morning.

03:15.168 --> 03:17.336
Now what the heck did you two
think you were doing?!

03:17.371 --> 03:20.106
- Okay, h-hold on a second.
- We can explain.

03:20.140 --> 03:22.574
Well, do you have any idea
what Lou's going through right now?

03:22.609 --> 03:24.075
How did you even know
we were here?

03:24.110 --> 03:26.712
Will Vernon called. That's how!

03:26.746 --> 03:28.747
He also said that you were
looking for a minister.

03:28.781 --> 03:30.682
We were, okay?

03:30.717 --> 03:32.684
We wanted to get away
from all the craziness.

03:32.719 --> 03:35.654
We just wanted something
that was... special.

03:35.688 --> 03:37.671
Well, congratulations. I guess
you got what you wanted.

03:37.691 --> 03:40.406
No, hold on. We didn't, guys.

03:40.426 --> 03:41.518
You didn't what?

03:41.538 --> 03:45.230
We wanted to be...
with family and friends.

03:45.264 --> 03:49.781
So... no. We didn't get married.

Good boy.

04:38.656 --> 04:42.385
Okay... okay,
does that feel better?

04:42.419 --> 04:46.289
Huh? Here, look.

04:46.323 --> 04:49.559
Got it? Got it? Good. Good boy.

04:56.766 --> 04:59.502
Hi, bud. You
gonna be nice today?

05:05.776 --> 05:07.509
Fine, be that way.

05:07.543 --> 05:10.268
But I can't help you
if you won't let me.

05:12.915 --> 05:15.150
Hey, Spartan. Hi.

05:19.355 --> 05:22.090
Well, you know
this is all your fault.

05:22.125 --> 05:24.326
- What're you talking about?
- Well, you gave 'em the idea.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.595
"When I look back on my wedding,

05:26.629 --> 05:29.160
it would've been better
if Marion and I'd just eloped."

05:29.180 --> 05:30.359
And I quote.

05:30.379 --> 05:33.531
Oh, you should talk about
running away and getting married.

05:33.551 --> 05:36.570
Ah!

05:36.605 --> 05:40.675
And you! I want you two
to stay on our tail.

05:40.709 --> 05:44.612
Don't get out of our sight
all the way back to Heartland.

05:48.532 --> 05:50.874
Compared to possible jail
time, this will be a picnic.

05:50.894 --> 05:53.053
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

05:53.587 --> 05:55.156
Get a move on! Let's go.

05:56.858 --> 05:58.626
What's-what's that, dad?

05:58.660 --> 06:00.834
No... you're-
you're coming in and out.

06:00.854 --> 06:02.863
Dad!

06:03.497 --> 06:06.500
They didn't get married?!

06:06.824 --> 06:08.235
Uh... okay! Fine.

06:08.270 --> 06:10.341
But-but-obviously
they don't want a wedding

06:10.361 --> 06:12.438
like the one we planned.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.684
They do.
Th-they wanna get married.

06:14.704 --> 06:17.196
Okay. Uh... yes!

06:17.216 --> 06:19.412
No, of course I'm relieved.

06:19.446 --> 06:21.481
Yeah... no, no. No!
I-I-I don't wanna talk to them

06:21.515 --> 06:23.475
or-or I'm gonna lose it.

06:23.495 --> 06:25.385
Yes. Okay.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.801
Okay, so, apparently they
thought about getting married

06:27.821 --> 06:28.988
but then they didn't get married

06:29.022 --> 06:31.757
and now they still wanna
get married.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.926
So it's a go. They're coming
home like nothing happened.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.762
Good! So then
it's all good now, right?

06:36.797 --> 06:38.912
And you can relax a whole bunch.

06:38.932 --> 06:42.622
Relax? Peter, there
is zero time to relax.

06:42.642 --> 06:44.869
Oh, Georgie, now that the
wedding is actually happening,

06:44.904 --> 06:47.206
you have your last
dress fitting today.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.425
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

06:49.445 --> 06:51.324
What do you mean,
you're not doing that?

06:51.344 --> 06:53.778
Wait, wait. I
got it, I got it.

06:53.813 --> 06:56.387
- I got it.
- Okay.

07:09.510 --> 07:11.863
What's the
deal with the dress?

07:11.897 --> 07:13.998
I don't wanna be part
of the wedding.

07:14.033 --> 07:16.601
I don't feel like... Watching people
promise to be together forever.

07:16.635 --> 07:18.836
It just... makes me sick.

07:21.673 --> 07:23.741
Well, I know that
you're mad at me,

07:23.775 --> 07:25.909
and I know you're mad
at your mom.

07:25.944 --> 07:28.177
But I don't know why
you're mad at Amy.

07:28.197 --> 07:30.462
'Cause she's the one you're gonna
hurt with this, you know that, right?

07:30.482 --> 07:33.083
Well, she doesn't
even want a big wedding.

07:33.118 --> 07:36.617
That's why her and Ty ran away
in the first place.

07:36.816 --> 07:40.792
I'd run away if I could...
And maybe I will.

07:41.772 --> 07:43.360
- C'mon, Georgie...
- No, I'm serious.

07:43.394 --> 07:46.227
I could go live with Jeff.

07:47.084 --> 07:48.765
Yup, well, I
guess that's a decision

07:48.799 --> 07:51.734
you're gonna have to make.

07:52.429 --> 07:56.959
Listen, your mom and I are really,
really trying to be positive about this-

07:56.979 --> 08:00.334
Yeah, 'cause there's so
much stuff to be positive about.

08:02.773 --> 08:05.581
So I guess...

08:05.615 --> 08:07.850
You're going back
to Vancouver now.

08:08.096 --> 08:10.789
No, I'm staying here.

08:11.388 --> 08:13.689
Your mom could use my support.

08:13.723 --> 08:17.890
And she could use yours too,
okay?

08:34.144 --> 08:35.750
Bye, dad.

08:38.214 --> 08:40.615
Hi, Remy. Good dog.
No, you stay outside.

08:40.649 --> 08:43.952
Stay.

08:46.689 --> 08:49.691
Lou. I am so, so sorry.

08:49.725 --> 08:51.278
And I understand
how upset you were.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.660
Are.

08:52.695 --> 08:54.862
Are... and I
just want you to know

08:54.896 --> 08:57.432
that it was good for us
to walk away.

08:57.466 --> 08:58.933
Well, I hope you guys
enjoyed yourselves

08:58.967 --> 09:00.901
because you gave us all
a heart attack.

09:00.936 --> 09:03.304
No, really. It put
things into perspective.

09:03.339 --> 09:05.906
And we are happy to go forward
with the wedding as planned.

09:05.941 --> 09:07.709
We'll do it your way now,
I promise.

09:07.743 --> 09:11.245
My way? Amy, it was never
just my way.

09:18.553 --> 09:19.920
Can I go and play, mommy?

09:19.955 --> 09:23.023
You don't want any pie?
Okay.

09:23.058 --> 09:25.559
All right. So the cake
and the caterers.

09:25.593 --> 09:27.728
- You're on top of that, right?
- Yes, I am. They're on track.

09:27.762 --> 09:30.129
Great. You two still need to
hang up the lights at the dude ranch,

09:30.164 --> 09:32.549
and the evergreens need to be
put into barrels, okay?

09:32.569 --> 09:35.974
Amy, you and Ty still wanna spend your
wedding night at the dude ranch, right?

09:35.994 --> 09:36.892
Uh, yeah.

09:37.066 --> 09:39.734
Okay.
And I hope you picked up your suit.

09:39.883 --> 09:41.775
Uh... my suit?

09:41.809 --> 09:43.577
Well, I have a suit.
It's... it's a nice one.

09:43.611 --> 09:45.411
It's the one I wore
at Jack and Lisa's party.

09:45.445 --> 09:48.781
Ty, it's your wedding day.
You need a formal black suit.

09:48.815 --> 09:52.018
I don't care if-if you rent it.
I told you and Caleb weeks ago.

09:52.052 --> 09:53.486
Aren't you glad you
came back from Pike River?

09:53.520 --> 09:55.955
Look, I'm sorry.
But, you know,

09:55.990 --> 09:58.457
you guys decided you wanted this
wedding enough that you didn't elope.

09:58.492 --> 10:00.059
So somebody has to pull it
all together,

10:00.094 --> 10:03.061
and I guess that someone is me.

10:03.550 --> 10:05.102
I'll get it.

10:09.202 --> 10:13.372
How can you let me know now?
This close to the day?

10:13.407 --> 10:17.609
Okay. Yes, I might've missed
your call earlier, but...

10:17.643 --> 10:20.212
This is unacceptable.
I am gonna talk to my lawyer.

10:20.246 --> 10:22.247
Fine!

10:22.563 --> 10:24.482
And the nightmare continues.

10:24.517 --> 10:26.485
What's going on?

10:26.505 --> 10:30.222
Hillsdale Valley Arena,
the-the venue... It fell through.

10:30.256 --> 10:32.524
What? How?

10:32.558 --> 10:34.859
They double
booked with a rodeo!

10:34.894 --> 10:37.061
A rodeo!
The wedding can't happen there.

10:37.095 --> 10:40.331
- That's great!
- That's great?!

10:40.365 --> 10:42.867
It's not great, Lou,
but just relax, okay?

10:42.902 --> 10:45.537
That venue felt too big anyway.
We'll find somewhere else.

10:45.571 --> 10:47.705
Amy, there is nowhere else.

10:47.740 --> 10:51.208
Anywhere even worth considering
would be booked by now.

10:51.243 --> 10:53.911
Lou, it's okay, all right?
We just wanna get married.

10:53.946 --> 10:55.246
It doesn't matter
where we do it.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.548
Yes it does, Amy!

10:58.313 --> 11:01.352
I... I'm sorry!
I-I totally messed this up!

11:01.386 --> 11:03.354
- Lou! It'll be fine.
- Lou!

11:03.388 --> 11:05.196
Just leave it, Peter.

11:07.653 --> 11:09.526
You know, when...

11:09.561 --> 11:12.496
Lyndy and I were
getting married,

11:12.530 --> 11:16.199
her parents planned
this big wedding...

11:16.233 --> 11:18.535
in a church, and...

11:18.570 --> 11:22.739
reception for...
two hundred or more.

11:22.774 --> 11:26.242
Well, Lyndy and I,
we weren't that into it.

11:26.277 --> 11:28.711
What we both really
wanted was...

11:28.745 --> 11:32.248
You know, something small.

11:32.283 --> 11:35.952
In fact, we both wanted
to get married right here,

11:35.987 --> 11:38.021
right in front
of this fireplace.

11:42.183 --> 11:43.392
So do I...

11:46.204 --> 11:48.214
I'm with you.

11:51.301 --> 11:52.635
Let's just have
the wedding here.

11:52.669 --> 11:54.737
It's the best of all places
and...

11:54.771 --> 11:56.238
I think that's what
I've always wanted!

11:56.272 --> 11:58.076
Then why didn't you say so?

11:58.096 --> 11:59.674
Well... I don't know.

11:59.709 --> 12:01.910
You just had everything
under control...

12:01.944 --> 12:04.646
Amy, if I pushed you
into things you didn't want,

12:04.680 --> 12:06.181
I'm sorry. All right?
That's not...

12:06.216 --> 12:07.868
that wasn't my intention.

12:07.888 --> 12:09.700
You didn't, Lou.

12:11.710 --> 12:15.252
Okay. Maybe a little.

12:16.133 --> 12:18.026
But I'm the one
who should be sorry.

12:18.060 --> 12:19.961
I should've been here,
giving you more feedback.

12:19.996 --> 12:23.064
And I know you were frustrated
with me.

12:23.098 --> 12:24.699
Now we have a chance
to do things differently.

12:24.734 --> 12:26.902
Amy, it's winter.

12:26.936 --> 12:28.837
We can't just pitch a tent
in the yard

12:28.871 --> 12:30.238
and throw up some twinkly
white lights

12:30.272 --> 12:32.106
and it will all be fine!

12:32.141 --> 12:33.508
No. But we can have it here
in the living room,

12:33.542 --> 12:35.143
in front of the fireplace.

12:35.177 --> 12:37.145
We'll never fit all
the guests in there.

12:37.179 --> 12:40.448
Sure we will, Lou. We've had
lots of big parties here.

12:41.974 --> 12:43.651
What is this?

12:43.685 --> 12:45.686
- It's your wedding dress.
- Really?

12:46.262 --> 12:48.689
Mrs. Bell sent it.

12:53.223 --> 12:56.764
Oh, Amy, it's beautiful.

12:57.106 --> 12:59.733
Lou, I wanna get married here.

12:59.768 --> 13:02.835
It will be simple and amazing.

13:02.870 --> 13:04.904
I really think that,
for the first time,

13:04.939 --> 13:08.676
it feels right.
For both me and for Ty.

13:27.094 --> 13:31.097
Hey! Look, I know you don't
trust me, but you can.

13:31.131 --> 13:34.968
I'm not gonna hurt you.

13:35.002 --> 13:37.035
You know what's gonna happen
if you don't at least try?

13:37.070 --> 13:39.438
You'll never have a home.
No one will ever take you.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.711
You're trouble.

13:45.745 --> 13:49.415
Trouble.
That's what I'm gonna name you.

13:52.789 --> 13:54.167
Trouble.

13:59.666 --> 14:01.534
That's it!

14:01.568 --> 14:04.224
Good boy!

14:05.316 --> 14:07.573
You know, I am actually
getting excited about the wedding.

14:07.608 --> 14:09.108
Like really excited.

14:09.142 --> 14:10.676
Did I tell you that
my dress came?

14:10.711 --> 14:12.211
Mrs. Bell did an amazing job!

14:12.245 --> 14:13.779
Have you picked yours up yet?

14:13.813 --> 14:16.090
Uh, no.

14:16.110 --> 14:18.017
Georgie, you only have a
couple of days to do that.

14:18.051 --> 14:19.952
Well...

14:19.986 --> 14:23.688
Would you be like super mad

14:23.723 --> 14:26.058
if... I wasn't your bridesmaid?

14:26.695 --> 14:29.611
Oh... okay.

14:30.162 --> 14:32.431
I'm disappointed,
but I understand

14:32.465 --> 14:34.433
that you're not going through
the greatest time right now.

14:34.467 --> 14:36.667
And if you don't wanna
stand up with me,

14:36.687 --> 14:38.303
it's okay.

14:41.173 --> 14:44.008
Amy! Look out!

14:48.370 --> 14:50.186
It's gonna take a lot
longer than I expected

14:50.206 --> 14:51.730
for this guy to come around.

14:51.750 --> 14:54.328
Well, you can't give up on him.
It'll just make things worse.

14:54.348 --> 14:57.525
He'll think no one in the whole
world cares about him.

15:03.895 --> 15:06.330
Hey... Georgie's worried
about you.

15:06.364 --> 15:08.866
You have to learn to trust us.

15:14.172 --> 15:16.941
What's wrong, Paint? Hmm?

15:17.509 --> 15:19.742
You okay?

15:22.246 --> 15:25.037
You feeling all right?

15:25.950 --> 15:27.084
Oh...

15:27.118 --> 15:29.877
- Hey there.
- Hey.

15:29.897 --> 15:33.141
- What's wrong with him?
- Feel his legs.

15:36.494 --> 15:38.571
Oh yeah.

15:38.591 --> 15:41.998
The lumps in his joints have really
gotten bigger, haven't they?

15:42.032 --> 15:44.367
And they're hot.
Really inflamed.

15:44.401 --> 15:46.636
How inflamed?

15:49.046 --> 15:51.908
Well, I'm sure the herbs and the
massage are good for him, Jack...

15:51.942 --> 15:55.883
But he's not healing up
like he ought to.

15:56.367 --> 15:58.881
Well, Scott can prescribe him
some drugs that could...

15:58.915 --> 16:01.750
That could help, you know?

16:01.784 --> 16:04.550
He... he just might not make the
progress that a younger horse...

16:04.570 --> 16:07.012
Just be straight with me.

16:09.928 --> 16:13.713
I hate to say this, Jack, but it...
it's time.

16:15.450 --> 16:17.365
His cow herding days are over.
I...

16:17.400 --> 16:20.058
I think you should
let him retire.

16:31.980 --> 16:34.449
Amy?

16:34.483 --> 16:37.085
I'm really sorry...

16:37.611 --> 16:39.746
About what?

16:40.577 --> 16:43.390
It's not your fault
everything is so messed up.

16:43.425 --> 16:46.323
I've been thinking
a lot about it and...

16:47.873 --> 16:52.129
Do you think I could still
be your bridesmaid?

16:53.792 --> 16:56.003
If you want me to?

16:56.038 --> 16:58.705
Of course I want
you to, Georgie.

16:59.312 --> 17:01.741
Thank you.

17:01.776 --> 17:06.512
And you know, if you ever
wanna talk about anything,

17:06.548 --> 17:10.556
I'm here to listen, okay?
I mean that.

17:12.319 --> 17:14.421
And I think you're right
about that horse.

17:14.455 --> 17:16.957
I understand, and we will give
him every chance he needs.

17:17.357 --> 17:20.026
Okay. Thank you.

17:35.298 --> 17:38.478
I don't know why we don't just
keep these up here all year round.

17:43.917 --> 17:45.951
Great.

17:51.891 --> 17:53.898
General.

17:56.380 --> 17:59.164
Surprised to see you here. I thought
you'd be long gone to Vancouver by now.

17:59.198 --> 18:01.466
Yeah, well, I'll be around
as long as Lou needs me, so.

18:01.501 --> 18:03.102
Well, first time
for everything, huh?

18:03.136 --> 18:06.138
All right, just
give it a rest, you guys.

18:06.172 --> 18:09.407
You know, Peter,
I haven't said much, but...

18:09.442 --> 18:12.810
I really hate to see you
and Lou go through this.

18:12.845 --> 18:14.746
You guys have always been
real good

18:14.780 --> 18:17.149
at working things out, together.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.651
Now you've got to think
about the girls too and...

18:19.685 --> 18:23.721
I know. I... I know, Jack.
Believe me, I do.

18:23.756 --> 18:26.223
But don't forget,
Marion had two girls too and...

18:26.258 --> 18:27.992
Amy and Lou grew up just fine,

18:28.027 --> 18:29.727
in spite of Tim being
an absentee father.

18:29.762 --> 18:31.829
Wha? What? What do you know?

18:31.864 --> 18:33.430
I know I'm not gonna be an
absentee dad, that's what I know,

18:33.465 --> 18:35.633
and I'm gonna be here
for my kids when they need me.

18:35.668 --> 18:37.635
I'm-I'm sensitive to that.

18:37.669 --> 18:40.070
Well, nothing says sensitive
like a separation agreement.

18:40.104 --> 18:41.872
You know what?
I don't need your crap, Tim.

18:41.906 --> 18:43.207
You're gonna have to
keep taking it, obviously...

18:43.241 --> 18:45.466
All right, all right, enough!

18:48.046 --> 18:49.880
We've got work to do here.
See those boughs?

18:49.914 --> 18:51.448
They all have to go
into these barrels.

18:51.483 --> 18:53.950
Lou's orders.
So let's get at it.

19:00.791 --> 19:03.927
Caleb, hey! Where are you, man?

19:03.961 --> 19:05.803
Did you remember to pick up
the suits?

19:08.465 --> 19:11.470
Oh, thank God. Lou
has been on my case.

19:11.490 --> 19:14.217
Well, I'm late cause they had to
do a few final alterations on my suit.

19:14.237 --> 19:15.916
That looks good.

19:15.936 --> 19:18.374
Well, I'll tell you, it's not
something I'd like to do everyday.

19:18.409 --> 19:21.376
The guy was a little too up
close and person for my taste.

19:23.386 --> 19:24.880
Oh yeah.

19:24.915 --> 19:26.882
I look hot in a tuxedo.

19:26.917 --> 19:29.551
Caleb! What the
heck is this?!

19:30.247 --> 19:32.221
Uh...

19:38.028 --> 19:40.196
- Hey, Amy!
- Can you believe it?

19:40.230 --> 19:42.564
This time tomorrow
we'll be married.

19:42.599 --> 19:46.235
Yeah. Really. We will.
Uh... it's crazy.

19:47.671 --> 19:49.364
Are you okay?

19:49.384 --> 19:50.772
Yeah. I'm fine.

19:50.806 --> 19:53.993
You just sound kind of...
nervous.

19:54.013 --> 19:55.076
Do you wanna come over?

19:55.111 --> 19:57.379
Uh... yeah, I... I can't.

19:57.413 --> 20:00.915
I got some last minute things
to, uh, fix up.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.516
Besides, it's bad luck
to see the bride

20:02.551 --> 20:04.942
the night before the wedding,
right?

20:05.599 --> 20:08.484
Okay. Be superstitious.

20:08.504 --> 20:09.891
I love you.

20:09.925 --> 20:12.170
- I love you too.
- I'll see you tomorrow and...

20:12.190 --> 20:13.746
don't be late, please.

20:13.766 --> 20:16.597
Okay.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.099
Caleb, what're we gonna do
with this?

20:19.134 --> 20:22.169
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:22.631 --> 20:25.506
- How're you feeling?
- Good.

20:25.540 --> 20:27.377
You're not thinking
of packing up your truck

20:27.397 --> 20:29.233
and leaving, are you?

20:29.253 --> 20:31.822
We are never gonna
live that one down, are we?

20:33.621 --> 20:34.862
Amy...

20:35.817 --> 20:39.719
I know Ty and I have had our
differences in the past, but...

20:40.221 --> 20:42.579
I know he loves you and...

20:44.800 --> 20:46.626
He's the right partner for you.

20:46.661 --> 20:49.235
You're still the best part
of the package.

20:49.255 --> 20:50.863
But one
of the hardest things

20:50.883 --> 20:52.973
that a father has to do
is entrust his daughter

20:52.993 --> 20:54.722
to another man.

20:54.742 --> 20:56.584
But Ty's the right man,

20:56.604 --> 21:00.612
so... you're happy, I'm happy.

21:05.013 --> 21:06.693
Bedtime for the bride.

21:06.713 --> 21:08.781
She needs her beauty sleep.

21:08.816 --> 21:11.583
Okay! You got all the
crazy plans together, Lou?

21:11.618 --> 21:13.452
Not really.
The bakery just called

21:13.486 --> 21:15.964
and the freezer broke down
without them knowing,

21:15.984 --> 21:18.324
so the cake basically melted.

21:18.358 --> 21:20.394
But that is not something
the bride needs to worry about.

21:20.414 --> 21:22.961
Right? Right.

21:26.499 --> 21:30.282
So your suit is number 5087,
right?

21:31.304 --> 21:35.486
Did you happen, by chance,
to get a black tux?

21:35.506 --> 21:36.871
Yes!

21:37.318 --> 21:39.930
Yes, it's very boring.

21:40.913 --> 21:43.062
Well, I think my friend
happens to have

21:43.082 --> 21:45.616
your totally awesome blue tux.

21:45.651 --> 21:48.786
Any chance that we can meet
and swap it out?

21:48.821 --> 21:52.824
Yes! Okay. I'll be there in
twenty minutes, tops.

21:53.334 --> 21:55.915
First round's on me. See ya.

21:56.064 --> 21:57.928
Done.

21:57.963 --> 22:01.566
See? Problem
solved. That's why I'm your best man.

22:04.302 --> 22:07.006
Hey, partner.
How're you feeling?

22:19.397 --> 22:22.868
Are you ready to take
one more ride with me?

22:30.252 --> 22:32.488
You've been a good friend

22:34.659 --> 22:36.347
and worked real hard.

22:38.736 --> 22:42.128
I guess you deserve a little
peace and quiet in the field.

22:48.950 --> 22:51.283
Lou, don't forget do give
the duderanch key to Ty.

22:51.284 --> 22:53.547
I'm on it! Dad, did
you pick up the flowers?

22:53.581 --> 22:55.316
Nobody asked me
to pick up flowers?

22:55.350 --> 22:57.623
These heels are killing me!
I am not wearing them!

22:57.643 --> 22:59.253
I told you to practice.

22:59.287 --> 23:01.154
Okay, the flowers are here.

23:01.188 --> 23:03.687
Where is Katie's other shoe?

24:29.840 --> 24:31.423
Wow.

24:32.245 --> 24:34.645
You look so beautiful.

26:17.813 --> 26:21.582
Welcome family,
friends, and loved ones.

26:21.616 --> 26:25.222
We gather today to celebrate
the wedding of Amy and Ty.

26:25.408 --> 26:26.951
You have come here to share
in this commitment

26:26.971 --> 26:29.369
that they make to one another,

26:29.389 --> 26:34.294
to offer your love and support
to their union,

26:34.329 --> 26:38.018
and to allow Amy and Ty to start
their married life together

26:38.038 --> 26:40.829
surrounded by the people dearest

26:40.849 --> 26:43.103
and most important to them.

26:43.803 --> 26:46.334
So let's get this started.

26:47.842 --> 26:51.711
Do you, Ty,
take Amy to be your wife,

26:52.188 --> 26:55.254
your partner in life
and your one true love.

26:55.403 --> 26:58.666
Will you love her, comfort her,

26:58.815 --> 27:00.735
honour her and protect her

27:00.755 --> 27:02.588
as long as you both shall live?

27:03.783 --> 27:05.496
I will.

27:06.786 --> 27:10.162
Do you, Amy, take
Ty to be your husband,

27:10.575 --> 27:13.331
your partner in life
and your one true love?

27:13.901 --> 27:16.648
Will you love him, comfort him,

27:16.668 --> 27:18.733
honour him and protect him

27:18.753 --> 27:21.049
as long as you both shall live?

27:21.069 --> 27:22.390
I will.

27:22.410 --> 27:25.443
Will you, family and friends,

27:25.810 --> 27:28.212
support and uphold Amy and Ty
in their marriage now

27:28.247 --> 27:30.567
and in the years to come?

27:30.587 --> 27:32.784
We will.

27:33.121 --> 27:35.931
Amy and Ty have
written their own vows.

27:35.951 --> 27:38.743
Please, go ahead
when you're both ready.

27:39.438 --> 27:40.559
Deep breath.

27:44.278 --> 27:47.479
Ty, you are my best friend,

27:48.025 --> 27:51.769
and I promise to love you
and cherish you.

27:52.467 --> 27:55.506
Amy, I have never had
a better friend.

27:56.215 --> 27:59.111
I promise to love you,
laugh with you

27:59.131 --> 28:01.445
and to comfort you.

28:02.010 --> 28:04.315
I promise to
grow along with you,

28:05.042 --> 28:06.946
and to be willing to face change

28:06.966 --> 28:08.352
when we both change.

28:08.386 --> 28:12.679
I promise to share my hopes,
my thoughts and my dreams

28:12.699 --> 28:14.733
as we build our lives together.

28:14.753 --> 28:16.887
When you need someone
to encourage you,

28:17.073 --> 28:19.329
you will always have me.

28:19.363 --> 28:23.032
When you need a helping hand,
you will always have mine.

28:23.066 --> 28:26.644
Because from this day forward,
you do not walk alone.

28:27.738 --> 28:29.572
My arms will be your shelter,

28:29.606 --> 28:33.008
my heart will be your home.

28:33.043 --> 28:35.510
I promise to love you
with all I have to give...

28:35.545 --> 28:38.147
And all that I have to give...

28:38.181 --> 28:41.591
In the only way that
I know - for I carry your heart.

28:41.802 --> 28:43.518
I carry it in my heart.

28:43.553 --> 28:46.130
Always and forever.

28:48.324 --> 28:50.448
May I have the rings, please?

29:00.603 --> 29:03.405
Ty, please place
this ring on Amy's finger

29:03.439 --> 29:05.639
and repeat after me.

29:06.124 --> 29:08.676
Amy, I give you this ring

29:08.710 --> 29:11.880
as a daily reminder
of my love for you.

29:12.180 --> 29:15.572
Amy, I give you this ring

29:15.592 --> 29:18.467
as a daily reminder
of my love for you.

29:20.522 --> 29:25.272
Amy, please place
this ring on Ty's finger

29:25.292 --> 29:27.495
and repeat after me.

29:27.922 --> 29:30.964
Ty, I give you this ring

29:30.999 --> 29:33.809
as a daily reminder
of my love for you.

29:33.829 --> 29:36.069
Ty, I give you this ring

29:36.104 --> 29:39.060
as a daily reminder
of my love for you.

29:40.562 --> 29:42.943
Well done.

29:42.977 --> 29:45.654
By the power of
your love and commitment

29:45.674 --> 29:47.881
and the power vested in me,

29:47.916 --> 29:51.753
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

29:53.118 --> 29:55.154
You may kiss each other!

30:21.301 --> 30:22.815
Soraya, it is so great to see you.

30:22.835 --> 30:24.768
I can't believe you came
all the way from England!

30:24.803 --> 30:25.959
Oh my God, I
wouldn't have missed it!

30:25.979 --> 30:27.704
You know that! Come here!

30:27.738 --> 30:30.340
Congratulations, Ty.
What a day!

30:30.374 --> 30:32.024
Yeah. Thanks for
being here, Clint.

30:32.044 --> 30:33.024
I appreciate it.

30:33.044 --> 30:38.829
Everyone, I would like to
officially introduce Ty and Amy

30:38.849 --> 30:41.785
for their first dance
as husband and wife.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.485
You look beautiful.

31:17.217 --> 31:18.748
Thank you.

31:21.724 --> 31:23.959
Hey, kids,
you wanna dance?

31:25.661 --> 31:28.864
Come here. You
guys look so pretty.

31:37.857 --> 31:39.474
Will you dance with me?

31:39.508 --> 31:42.042
Excuse me.
I will.

31:58.426 --> 32:01.328
You look so
handsome it's ridiculous.

32:01.363 --> 32:03.530
Thank you.

32:08.708 --> 32:11.041
I love you.

32:12.219 --> 32:14.466
What did you just say?

32:15.009 --> 32:17.277
Well, one of us had to say it.
You weren't showing any signs.

32:17.311 --> 32:20.127
I said it. I said it already.
I...

32:20.147 --> 32:21.815
- You never responded.
- You did not. When did you say that?

32:21.849 --> 32:25.118
The other day I said
it and you said, "mmm..."

32:25.152 --> 32:27.320
- That's not true!
- Yeah!

32:44.504 --> 32:46.104
Can I borrow
him for a moment?

32:46.139 --> 32:48.313
- Sure. Yeah.
- Thank you.

32:48.697 --> 32:51.009
Okay.

32:53.814 --> 32:58.383
I guess this probably isn't
the right time or place but...

32:58.418 --> 33:01.619
You do know I got Jesse
to drop the charges against Ty?

33:02.057 --> 33:04.390
- I do.
- Yeah, well...

33:04.589 --> 33:05.991
The other issue...

33:06.025 --> 33:08.660
The lien Jesse put on
your property?

33:08.694 --> 33:11.487
I tried to set that right too,
but unfortunately, I couldn't.

33:11.507 --> 33:13.164
It's already in effect.

33:13.198 --> 33:15.061
If the loan isn't paid
within the next month,

33:15.081 --> 33:16.133
the bank will call it.

33:16.168 --> 33:18.027
Well, I appreciate
you trying, Val.

33:18.047 --> 33:20.101
Thank you.

33:22.074 --> 33:23.508
You're kidding.

33:23.542 --> 33:26.583
Caleb, I'm more than
happy to cover the loan.

33:26.603 --> 33:28.913
Jesse was completely
out of line.

33:28.948 --> 33:31.849
See, he hasn't realized yet

33:31.883 --> 33:35.486
that money can tear friends
and family apart.

33:35.520 --> 33:38.789
And that's not the way
the Stanton's do business.

33:39.425 --> 33:41.208
I can't accept this.

33:41.228 --> 33:42.928
Yes you can.

33:47.231 --> 33:50.433
Wow. The man sure looks
damn good in a tux.

33:54.677 --> 33:56.451
Caleb...

33:58.743 --> 34:03.013
You know I always thought you
weren't good enough for Ashley.

34:03.507 --> 34:05.482
I was wrong.

34:05.516 --> 34:07.617
She's never been as happy
as she was with you.

34:20.563 --> 34:22.021
You know,
weddings are funny.

34:22.041 --> 34:25.067
They have a way of making you
remember your own.

34:25.101 --> 34:27.898
Ours was kind of crazy,
wasn't it?

34:28.022 --> 34:29.639
It was pretty great.

34:29.672 --> 34:31.940
Remember grandpa surprised us
with that sleigh?

34:31.975 --> 34:34.514
Yes! I
remember how cold it was!

34:34.534 --> 34:36.581
It was freezing! Oh...

34:38.208 --> 34:39.801
But I didn't care.

34:39.821 --> 34:42.654
That was the happiest day
of my life.

34:43.585 --> 34:47.114
- I'm sorry, I didn't um...
- No. It's okay.

34:47.134 --> 34:50.918
It was... It was a great day.

34:53.226 --> 34:54.862
Jeff?

34:54.897 --> 34:58.790
Um, I... I have a question.

34:59.572 --> 35:02.617
If... if I wanted to,

35:02.637 --> 35:05.512
do you think I could
come live with you?

35:05.532 --> 35:08.043
You wanted me to before.

35:08.063 --> 35:12.387
Uh... look, Georgie,

35:12.407 --> 35:16.122
I get that you're upset
about Lou and Peter,

35:16.142 --> 35:18.299
you know,
splitting up and everything...

35:18.319 --> 35:20.521
- But-but Jeff...
- Just listen to me, all right?

35:20.556 --> 35:23.573
You will do way better
staying here

35:23.593 --> 35:25.358
than you will living with me.

35:25.393 --> 35:27.953
I'm working real long hours
to prove myself at this job

35:27.973 --> 35:29.665
and it's just...

35:29.685 --> 35:32.165
It's not the place
for you to be.

35:33.036 --> 35:35.133
And look at them...

35:35.468 --> 35:36.503
Who knows, but...

35:36.537 --> 35:39.807
Those two don't look like
they're over.

35:39.841 --> 35:42.375
But they are.

35:42.410 --> 35:47.226
Even so, neither of
them will ever abandon you.

35:48.219 --> 35:49.849
You can count on that.

35:59.093 --> 36:05.345
Okay, folks. Now I have a
note from Ty's parents to read

36:05.365 --> 36:11.046
and emails from as far away
as England, from Mallory.

36:11.257 --> 36:12.404
Now there'll be speeches

36:12.439 --> 36:15.159
and more speeches to come,
I'm sure.

36:15.179 --> 36:18.344
After a courtship like Amy
and Ty have had,

36:18.378 --> 36:21.420
everybody's got
something to say.

36:21.767 --> 36:22.715
It's true!

36:22.735 --> 36:24.936
But there's one
more step to take

36:24.956 --> 36:28.187
before this marriage
is complete.

36:28.665 --> 36:31.176
Now my family,
the Bartlett family,

36:31.196 --> 36:34.826
has a tradition
as old as this ranch.

36:34.981 --> 36:38.897
And, Ty, now that you are
officially part of this tribe,

36:39.454 --> 36:42.512
and I can't tell you
how proud I am to say that,

36:42.532 --> 36:45.038
it's time for you
to pick a stone.

36:46.838 --> 36:47.639
Make it quick, Ty,

36:47.673 --> 36:49.999
before he goes into that
old yarn of his.

36:52.244 --> 36:54.280
Which one's
yours again, Amy?

36:54.300 --> 36:55.713
This one.

36:56.360 --> 36:57.681
Is this one taken?

36:57.701 --> 36:59.250
No, sir.

36:59.919 --> 37:01.352
That's the one then.

37:01.387 --> 37:06.364
Done. This is now,
officially, the Ty Borden stone.

37:06.384 --> 37:07.892
Hooray! Yay! Yes, sir!

37:08.531 --> 37:10.626
Cheers, everyone. To Amy and Ty.

37:10.661 --> 37:13.318
Cheers!

37:20.898 --> 37:22.871
All right.

37:24.919 --> 37:27.776
Okay, I got this.

37:27.811 --> 37:31.046
- Now watch your dress.
- Just don't drop me.

37:31.081 --> 37:33.539
All right.

37:38.154 --> 37:40.856
- It's locked.
- Don't you have a key?

37:40.890 --> 37:42.390
Oh yeah, Lou said she put it
in my suit pocket.

37:42.425 --> 37:44.126
- Can you get it?
- Put me down?

37:45.828 --> 37:47.457
Okay...

37:50.125 --> 37:52.834
She didn't do it.

37:52.868 --> 37:56.605
The great wedding planner
forgot to give me the key.

37:56.639 --> 38:00.374
Hold on a second.

38:00.408 --> 38:02.744
Ty! Not a good idea.

38:07.324 --> 38:09.784
I got a better idea.

38:18.384 --> 38:20.549
No, I can walk!

38:20.569 --> 38:22.263
Okay.

38:31.239 --> 38:32.773
Oh! Hold on a second.
Hold on, hold on.

38:32.807 --> 38:34.579
Come here.

38:40.748 --> 38:43.396
I'm glad that
cabin was locked.

38:46.754 --> 38:50.022
Hey, it all started
here, didn't it?

38:50.057 --> 38:54.160
So I guess I did it. I
married the boy in the loft.

39:22.442 --> 39:25.296
So the cow said
"Hey, close the door".

39:25.317 --> 39:27.486
Were you raised in a house?"

39:29.655 --> 39:32.691
Hey-hey!

39:32.725 --> 39:35.026
Oh, there they are!

39:35.060 --> 39:38.429
How was your night?
Did you like the cabin?

39:38.464 --> 39:40.531
Um, yes, it would've
been great, Lou,

39:40.565 --> 39:42.113
except that the door was locked.

39:42.133 --> 39:45.203
- What? No!
- Yeah. It's okay though.

39:45.237 --> 39:47.071
- It all worked out.
- Oh no!

39:47.106 --> 39:48.473
Oh no, someone
left the door locked.

39:48.507 --> 39:51.375
They forgot the keys?!
That so wasn't on my list!

39:51.409 --> 39:53.410
- Oh wait!
- So sorry.

39:53.444 --> 39:55.962
Speaking of keys,
I have something to say.

39:55.982 --> 39:59.182
We all got together
on your wedding present

39:59.217 --> 40:03.053
and... here it is.

40:03.087 --> 40:06.908
- Uh.
- What? Did you-to France?!

40:06.928 --> 40:08.584
Are you kidding?!

40:08.604 --> 40:10.552
And this is the key
to my home in Toulon...

40:10.572 --> 40:13.430
it actually opens the door
to the house...

40:13.464 --> 40:14.952
and it's all yours.

40:14.972 --> 40:16.400
And the car is coming
this afternoon,

40:16.434 --> 40:18.204
so I'd go pack, if I were you.

40:18.224 --> 40:22.039
- What?! This is unbelievable!
- Thank you!

40:22.073 --> 40:23.507
- We're going to France.
- Yeah!

40:23.541 --> 40:25.274
Guess what?

40:25.308 --> 40:26.743
This time,
you get to go together.

40:35.300 --> 40:38.837
That was the most
beautiful wedding ever.

40:38.857 --> 40:41.757
It was better
than I ever imagined.

40:41.791 --> 40:43.865
I couldn't have done it
without you.

40:43.885 --> 40:46.719
- You're the best.
- Thank you.

40:46.739 --> 40:49.131
- Where is Georgie?
- I-you know, I don't know.

40:49.166 --> 40:51.400
I told her you were leaving.

40:51.435 --> 40:52.801
Peter, have you seen Georgie?

40:52.835 --> 40:54.480
No.

40:54.500 --> 40:56.072
Your chariot
awaits, madame.

40:56.106 --> 40:57.573
- Okay.
- Okay.

40:57.607 --> 40:59.041
Don't wanna miss your flight.

40:59.075 --> 41:00.375
- Tell Georgie I'll call her.
- I will.

41:00.409 --> 41:02.143
Yeah, we better get going, Amy.

41:02.178 --> 41:03.478
Jack.

41:03.512 --> 41:06.147
- Proud of you.
- Thank you.

41:06.574 --> 41:08.199
Hey.

41:10.452 --> 41:12.406
You be safe.

41:12.589 --> 41:14.576
I love you.

41:21.397 --> 41:22.897
We'll miss you!

41:36.377 --> 41:37.979
It's okay.

41:38.013 --> 41:39.146
You don't have to be afraid
anymore.

41:39.180 --> 41:41.390
You can trust me.

41:46.097 --> 41:48.388
It's okay.

41:48.423 --> 41:50.857
I don't want you to go.

41:50.891 --> 41:53.327
I'm here with you,
I'll take care of you.

42:05.806 --> 42:07.473
- Stop the car.
- Hey.

42:49.683 --> 42:52.484
It's okay.
