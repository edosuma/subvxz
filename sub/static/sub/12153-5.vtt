Oh, it's got heart.
Yes, it's got laser battles.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.900
It's got a timely message
of interstellar poverty.

00:20.900 --> 00:24.800
Uh-huh. Listen, have your assistant
call my assistant.

00:24.800 --> 00:27.200
We'll set somethin' up.
Good enough.

00:27.200 --> 00:31.100
J.C., listen,
just got off the Nextel with Big B.

00:31.100 --> 00:34.100
Yeah, intrigued, but wants to know
who's playing Tom Joad. Uh-huh.

00:34.100 --> 00:37.400
Well, I'm pretty sure that
Henry Fonda's dead, sweetie.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.300
Yeah. ''Bring him back to life''?

00:39.300 --> 00:41.900
Let me talk to my science people.
Okay, no promises.

00:41.900 --> 00:44.600
- Directors. Harmonica!
- Lorney Tunes!

00:44.600 --> 00:47.500
Oh, the eyes, the hair, the dress.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.500
It's no wonder the fourth floor
has a crush on you.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.700
Hey, tell me, priceless.
Where do I find Angel?

00:51.700 --> 00:54.400
Just called. He's on his way back in
from a field mission.

00:54.400 --> 00:57.400
<i>Though I wouldn't, if I were you.</i>
<i>It sounds like he's in a mood.</i>

00:57.400 --> 01:00.600
Oh, don't worry, darlin'. I've pulled
the big boy out of many a broodfest.

Angel, how did the new
neural-intercept grenade work?

01:08.800 --> 01:11.500
It didn't.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.800
Right. I'll take it down to Fred,
have her look at it.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.700
Hey, Angelheart.
Wes, if you see Fred...

01:15.700 --> 01:17.600
can you have her
pencil me in for later?

01:17.600 --> 01:20.200
I've gotta talk to her about
Henry Fonda's big comeback.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.700
- [ Wesley ] All right.
- Angel, we gotta have a confab.

01:22.700 --> 01:25.600
<i>- Es muy importante.</i>

01:25.600 --> 01:28.700
It's about the party. I've done
all I can do for the big to-do...

01:28.700 --> 01:31.800
but we've still got a few bugs
to comb out of the cootie garage.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.300
A bridge too far?
Let me try it again.

01:34.300 --> 01:37.000
Lorne, I've been out all night.
I'm beat up. I'm exhausted.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.900
I'm covered head to toe in Thraxis blood,
which actually kind of burns...

01:39.900 --> 01:42.100
so this is all gonna have to wait
until I take a shower.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.900
- You killed a Thraxis? But--
- Shower.

01:45.400 --> 01:49.100
Van, why don't we scratch the Thraxis
off of the invite list?

01:49.100 --> 01:51.600
And you got a copy of that print ad
we're gonna run this week?

01:51.600 --> 01:54.000
- Yeah. Right.
- What is this?

01:54.000 --> 01:56.400
''Wolfram and Hart
wants to be up your alley''?

01:56.400 --> 01:58.600
That's like a bus station
pickup line. Change it.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.800
On second thought, burn it.
Grab yourself a bagel or somethin' too.

No pun intended.

Maybe 'cause we're

Well, some people are comin',

the A-list people--
they seem to be giving it a miss.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.000
- And if they don't show up,
this shindig is gonna be a bust.
- Good.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.500
- Good?
- Yeah, I wasn't too crazy
about this thing to begin with.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.700
I mean, we are talking about
our clients, right?

07:03.700 --> 07:06.400
Our evil clients. Not the sort of folks
I'd really like to show a good time.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.800
I'd be a lot happier if the whole thing
just kind of fell through.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.400
- Then we can get back to--
- [ Laughs ] Okay! Okay, you're killin' me!

Can't you just feel up
the big picture, Mr. Magoo?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.300
It's not about good and evil.
It's about party.

a mood, a snit, even.

07:33.400 --> 07:37.700
So what say we talk about this once
you've calmed down a bit?

07:41.800 --> 07:43.700
Yeah, sure. That's fine with--

07:43.700 --> 07:46.200
Great. Your office, 25 minutes.

- Was Angel mad?
- Shouldn't he be?

07:53.300 --> 07:55.400
We sent him out there with
a defective piece of weaponry.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.900
Which ''we'' are we talking about?

07:57.900 --> 08:01.700
Fred, these techno-mystical hybrids
are a complicated affair.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.600
I don't know.
They seem kind of simple to me.

08:04.600 --> 08:08.300
<i>It's just a little handheld,</i>
<i>spell-casting robot, right?</i>

08:08.300 --> 08:11.800
So it's either the robot or the spell
that we have a problem with.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.700
Well, the grenade's core
enchantment looks operational...

08:14.700 --> 08:17.300
so I think we're talking about
a faulty trigger mechanism.

08:17.300 --> 08:19.700
No. Wait a minute.
I designed that mechanism myself.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.000
<i>Yeah, that's right, and I machined it.</i>

08:22.000 --> 08:25.700
It was beautiful work
on both counts, if I may say.

08:25.700 --> 08:28.500
- You may.
- [ Chuckles ]

08:28.500 --> 08:30.700
I agree, as a sculptural piece.

08:30.700 --> 08:32.900
But the device's trigger
may not have been refined enough...

08:32.900 --> 08:34.799
to actually trigger the effect.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.700
Happy Halloween, kids.

<i>How do you know your spell-casters</i>
<i>didn't screw up the payload?</i>

08:39.400 --> 08:43.100

you get when you know something.

something a little more important...

make these sort of judgments.

Listen, Angel, don't worry about a thing.
This is my forte.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.800
but they all played nicely
together while they were there.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.600

Fine. I surrender.
Go ahead, Lorne.

37:41.400 --> 37:44.700
What I can't figure out
is why I said I'd do it tonight.

37:44.700 --> 37:48.300
Yeah. A lot of us are having
that kind of problem.

37:49.800 --> 37:53.500
I kind of wished you were here.

37:54.700 --> 37:56.600
Well, the night is still young.

37:56.600 --> 37:59.500
Well, I mean, no,
it's over, actually.

37:59.500 --> 38:03.900
<i>But, uh, did you-- do you</i>
<i>wanna get a cup of coffee?</i>

38:05.100 --> 38:07.600
Actually, I could use a drink.

38:14.800 --> 38:19.700
That thing-- I think it was
a manifestation of Lorne's subconscious.

38:19.700 --> 38:23.100
It peeled away from his mind,
using Lorne's supernatural powers...

38:23.100 --> 38:25.500
to punch its way into our world.

38:25.500 --> 38:28.000
''Punch'' is the right word.
Why was it trying to kill everyone?

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
I don't think it was.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.900
It may have just been processing
the conflicts...

38:31.900 --> 38:34.600
that Lorne normally
deals with in his sleep...

38:34.600 --> 38:37.400
acting out on the emotional responses
he has to the people around him.

38:37.400 --> 38:41.700
I guess Lorne makes
some judgments after all. Eve--

38:41.700 --> 38:46.200
So, I guess we should--
I don't know-- talk?

38:46.200 --> 38:48.600
About what?

38:48.600 --> 38:52.400
About what happened,
you know, back there, with us.

38:52.800 --> 38:56.200
Angel, it's not like this is
the first time I've had sex...

38:56.200 --> 38:58.200
under a mystical influence.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.000
I went to U.C. Santa Cruz.

39:02.100 --> 39:03.900
<i>[ Door Opens ]</i>

39:06.500 --> 39:09.300
How you doin'?

39:09.300 --> 39:11.200
I don't know.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.900
- [ Sniffs ]
- [ Laughs ]

39:23.900 --> 39:26.500
I'm a slob.
[ Laughs ]

39:32.300 --> 39:35.300
Hey, I spoke with Sebassis's people,
explained what I could.

39:35.300 --> 39:38.000
Yeah, so what've we got?
Lawsuit? Demon war?

39:38.000 --> 39:41.800
No. Seems like they enjoy a little
blood sport at their social functions.

39:41.800 --> 39:45.500
- Looks like we're okay.
- We're not okay.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.800
We've been so focused
on the dangers outside...

39:47.800 --> 39:50.500
that we didn't see the ones within.

39:50.500 --> 39:54.000
This place is tryin'
to change us, Gunn.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.800
We can't ever forget that.

39:57.400 --> 40:01.100
Pretty damn good party though.
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:01.100 --> 40:03.900
Well, you know, today, but later.

40:03.900 --> 40:06.300
<i>- Oh, and your chair--</i>
- What?

40:06.300 --> 40:09.300
Don't sit in it.
I already called Janitorial.

40:09.300 --> 40:11.600
Why can't I--

40:11.600 --> 40:15.100
You pissed in the big man's chair?
That's fantastic.

40:15.100 --> 40:17.000
Spike, can you please turn off
that warm fuzzy?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.700
What, the Lorne thing? Wore off.
I just think that's bloody fabulous.

40:19.700 --> 40:22.100
All right, guys. Good night.

40:22.100 --> 40:24.600
Let Lorne get some sleep, all right?

40:24.600 --> 40:26.800
Out.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.100
All right.Just this once.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.600
<i>[ Lorne Moans, Mumbles ]</i>

40:34.600 --> 40:36.800
I'm sorry.
[ Mumbling Continues ]

40:36.800 --> 40:39.300
Hey, it's okay, Lorne.

40:39.300 --> 40:42.000
-Just try to get some rest. Get some sleep.
- Mmm.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.800
Yeah. 'Cause it's-- it's hard to--

40:46.100 --> 40:48.600
It's hard bein'--
bein' the host of the party.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.500
Bein'--

40:50.500 --> 40:54.300
Stop tryin' to be.
