The Democratic Republic of Congo
is the scene of the worst

01:23.072 --> 01:26.830
humanitarian crisis in the world
according to the United Nations.

01:27.530 --> 01:30.761
<i>In what has been described
as the world's deadliest conflict</i>

01:30.861 --> 01:34.338
<i>since World War II,
millions of people have been killed.</i>

01:35.304 --> 01:39.567
<i>Massacres and rape,
routinely used as weapons of war,</i>

01:39.667 --> 01:43.746
<i>have forced hundreds of thousands
of people to flee their homes.</i>

01:43.846 --> 01:48.909
<i>For years, the United Nations
and non-governmental organizations, NGOs,</i>

01:49.009 --> 01:53.814
<i>have been providing humanitarian relief
in an increasingly unstable situation,</i>

01:53.914 --> 01:57.331
<i>often requiring the presence
of private security contractors</i>

01:57.431 --> 01:59.920
<i>to ensure aid workers' safety.</i>

02:00.020 --> 02:03.132
<i>The conflict is fuelled
by the country's vast mineral wealth,</i>

02:03.232 --> 02:06.954
<i>with all sides suspected
of deliberately prolonging the violence</i>

02:07.428 --> 02:10.823
<i>to plunder natural resources
such as gold, diamonds,</i>

02:10.923 --> 02:14.744
<i>copper, coltan,
and other high-value minerals</i>

02:14.844 --> 02:18.273
<i>to meet the growing demand
of the Western world.</i>

02:19.949 --> 02:24.086
<i>Despite calls for a ceasefire
and the presence of UN peacekeepers,</i>

02:24.186 --> 02:28.617
<i>a deteriorating humanitarian situation
of poverty and corruption</i>

02:28.758 --> 02:35.289
<i>jeopardize hopes of a lasting peace
and reconstruction of the shattered nation.</i>

03:01.640 --> 03:02.900
Jimmy!

03:03.000 --> 03:04.919
- Hey.
- What are you drinking?

03:05.019 --> 03:07.521
Oh, you guys look pretty tonight,
but I got my gal over here.

03:07.621 --> 03:10.883
- I'll buy you one.
- Roger that, Jim.

03:10.983 --> 03:12.401
- Hey, chief.
- Hey, what's happening?

03:12.501 --> 03:14.403
- We're up to here in mud out there.
- Jesus.

03:14.503 --> 03:17.407
- So I shut down the site for tonight.
- Will it be ready?

03:17.507 --> 03:21.477
There are not enough of us.
We have to meet the new Minister of Health.

03:21.577 --> 03:25.222
We need his support
to train medical staff locally.

03:25.322 --> 03:27.233
I'll get a face-to-face meeting
and we'll go together.

03:27.333 --> 03:28.259
Okay.

03:28.359 --> 03:30.412
- I'll email him now.
- Thank you. Hey.

03:32.396 --> 03:33.889
- How are you?
- Good.

03:33.989 --> 03:35.650
- Hey. How are you?
- What's up?

03:35.750 --> 03:39.094
- Where am I? Where do you want me?
- Here. No.

03:39.194 --> 03:41.664
What are you having, Jim?

03:41.764 --> 03:44.108
I'll have a pretty little thing
just like Annie's got here.

03:44.208 --> 03:46.586
- A blue one.
- A blue one, yeah.

03:50.222 --> 03:54.310
- Was there anything else, Annie?
- Yes, there was.

03:54.410 --> 03:58.798
We also need to coordinate with local NGOs
to distribute condoms outside the clinics...

03:58.898 --> 04:02.009
Oh, man. Don't talk to me
about condom distribution.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.420
It's like rape promotion
in these villages.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.881
You might as well
hand them out to the wild dogs.

04:06.981 --> 04:10.117
And a great humanitarian, Mr. Terry Cox.

04:10.217 --> 04:12.561
Wait a minute. How long
we been friends? Twenty years?

04:12.661 --> 04:15.214
I think that's the first time
I've ever heard you call me a humanitarian.

04:15.314 --> 04:17.116
<i>Our main story from Africa,</i>

04:17.216 --> 04:19.652
<i>where the Minister of Mining
and Natural Resources</i>

04:19.752 --> 04:23.139
<i>of the Democratic Republic of Congo
has triggered a burst of reactions</i>

04:23.239 --> 04:25.718
<i>from the international community
this afternoon</i>

04:25.818 --> 04:27.585
<i>by announcing the decision to cancel</i>

04:27.685 --> 04:31.907
<i>and renegotiate all pre-existing contracts
with foreign mining companies.</i>

04:32.206 --> 04:34.675
<i>With growing evidence
of political corruption,</i>

04:34.775 --> 04:38.354
<i>there are questions regarding
the motivations behind this decision,</i>

04:38.454 --> 04:40.265
<i>but the minister
advocates the restricted...</i>

05:01.694 --> 05:03.612
Good morning, honey.

05:03.712 --> 05:07.041
- I've gotta go to work.
- Okey-dokey.

05:07.566 --> 05:10.036
Really. We are short on staff.

05:10.136 --> 05:11.679
- I have to.
- Okay, sweetheart.

05:11.779 --> 05:15.709
- You have a good day at work.
- Let me go.

05:32.992 --> 05:36.628
- Don't you have to go to work, too?
- I think I got a couple of hours.

05:36.728 --> 05:39.899
I gotta grab some stuff from my place,
and then get out to the site.

05:39.999 --> 05:41.426
What are you doing over there?

05:42.209 --> 05:45.471
Aren't you guys here to work for us?
To protect us?

05:45.571 --> 05:49.325
I am your 24-hour personal bodyguard.

05:49.425 --> 05:52.871
I'm putting my meanest guys
on the clinic tonight. You'll be safe.

05:55.514 --> 05:57.625
Will you work late?

05:57.725 --> 05:59.953
I'm hoping not.

06:01.353 --> 06:03.381
I'll see you later.

06:07.359 --> 06:08.787
See you later, Jim.

06:16.077 --> 06:19.147
<i>How we doing on
the perimeter-fence check? Over.</i>

06:19.538 --> 06:21.107
<i>Perimeter checked and secured.</i>

06:21.207 --> 06:25.444
<i>This security detail's getting boring.
I can't wait to see some real action.</i>

06:25.544 --> 06:27.420
<i>It's crazy hot out here tonight.</i>

06:27.520 --> 06:30.482
<i>I've made sure that every checkpoint
is resupplied with fresh water.</i>

06:30.582 --> 06:32.785
Roger that. I don't know about you,

06:32.885 --> 06:36.197
<i>but I find it harder and harder
to focus out here in this heat.</i>

06:36.297 --> 06:38.933
I've been letting the dehydration
get to my memory so much,

06:39.033 --> 06:41.777
<i>I'm having to start writing shit down
just to remember to take a piss.</i>

06:41.877 --> 06:46.550
I was video-documenting on my cell phone
earlier, like a goddamn wazoo.

06:47.149 --> 06:49.327
Action at the gate. Sitrep.

06:49.427 --> 06:51.772
<i>Roger. Two NGO vehicles on site.</i>

06:52.538 --> 06:55.232
<i>Seems to be Felix's escort.</i>

07:01.230 --> 07:05.469
<i>Felix and Cox jabbering. What do you figure
that's all about at 2200 hours?</i>

07:05.968 --> 07:10.573
- On my mark, switch to all freq 4.
- <i>Roger. Switching now.</i>

07:11.090 --> 07:13.360
- <i>Reed, Jim. Check.</i>
- Lima Charlie to me.

07:14.885 --> 07:18.206
I got a feeling we're going operational.

07:48.361 --> 07:49.554
- Hey, Annie.
- Felix.

07:49.654 --> 07:53.500
- Hello. Is he gonna make it?
- Till the next time.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.493
- I need a break.
- Sure.

07:55.593 --> 08:00.206
We've had five of those
machete wounds today. We lost two.

08:00.306 --> 08:02.825
Another day in paradise.

08:02.925 --> 08:04.752
Did you get us a meeting
with the Minister of Health?

08:04.852 --> 08:07.079
Yeah. 9:00 tomorrow morning, you and I.

08:07.179 --> 08:10.650
- Happy?
- Did you go to the airstrip tonight?

08:10.858 --> 08:14.136
- Just for a few minutes. Administrative.
- Did you see Jim?

08:14.236 --> 08:16.305
I didn't speak to him.
I didn't wanna bother him.

08:16.405 --> 08:20.110
They've got a big job out there,
and I had a sense they'd go late.

08:21.827 --> 08:24.480
He's a lucky man, Jim Terrier.

08:24.580 --> 08:27.865
- He's a hard man.
- If only you could love a soft one.

08:33.706 --> 08:37.753
- Can I drive you home?
- Thanks, but I'll wait for Jim.

08:38.152 --> 08:39.370
Okay.

08:39.470 --> 08:42.398
There's plenty of work here
for me to pass the time.

08:42.498 --> 08:45.076
I only stopped by to ask you that.

09:01.367 --> 09:02.952
Hey, Jim. Document this.

09:03.052 --> 09:05.346
Oh, Reed! Watch where
you point that weapon, man.

09:05.446 --> 09:07.039
Have some barrel control, man.

09:07.139 --> 09:08.824
All right, mates,
here are your target packs.

09:08.924 --> 09:12.037
Drop that, Jimmy.
This is Operation Calvary.

09:12.536 --> 09:14.422
We insert as a team here,

09:14.522 --> 09:18.559
four degrees, 18 minutes south,
15 degrees, 18 minutes east.

09:18.659 --> 09:23.424
Reed, you are Sierra 1, and you'll be
positioned here, in a third-floor apartment.

09:23.524 --> 09:27.835
Two blocks down will be Bryson,
Sierra 2, and Jim, Sierra 3.

09:27.935 --> 09:32.210
You're the lucky one, Jim.
Double bedroom at the Grand Hotel.

09:34.751 --> 09:35.877
Reed, report.

09:35.977 --> 09:38.313
Tango 1 is completing
a three-car convoy.

09:38.612 --> 09:41.733
Fronting and backing vehicles
are low profile, soft skins.

09:42.232 --> 09:45.837
Target vehicle:
B7 armored white, Toyota Land Cruiser.

09:46.963 --> 09:50.021
The convoy will travel westbound
down the boulevard.

09:50.121 --> 09:54.987
He'll hit a natural choke point, giving us
three to five-second window of opportunity.

09:55.087 --> 09:57.999
Yeah. You guys are already zeroed
for ballistic advantage.

09:58.099 --> 10:01.452
Your drop cards are adjusted
to Kinshasa density altitude, right?

10:01.552 --> 10:02.853
- Roger that.
- Roger. Green light?

10:02.953 --> 10:05.706
Felix will give the green light
when he confirms the target is inbound.

10:05.806 --> 10:09.602
Felix will also designate
which of you shooters engages.

10:09.702 --> 10:11.763
- Any other questions?
- Extraction plan?

10:12.062 --> 10:15.809
Once the hit occurs, the shooter,
and the shooter only, is into the wind.

10:17.635 --> 10:21.180
- Off continent?
- Yeah. We have a plane on standby.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.657
That's how Felix wants it.

10:23.757 --> 10:26.689
Don't let the target escape the X.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.326
<i>Sierra 3, copy.</i>

11:40.451 --> 11:41.770
Sierra 3, Lima Charlie.

11:42.962 --> 11:45.215
<i>Nice night in Kinshasa, huh?</i>

11:51.036 --> 11:52.823
You are the designated trigger, Jim.

11:57.151 --> 12:00.663
I had a feeling. Roger that.

12:05.284 --> 12:07.996
- Hey.
- <i>I'm here.</i>

12:14.176 --> 12:16.709
Look out for her for me, will you?

12:17.505 --> 12:22.010
I will take care of Annie.
You have my word, Jim.

12:35.831 --> 12:38.459
<i>Calvary is confirmed.</i>

12:39.151 --> 12:42.822
<i>Stand by. Stand by.
Confirm Tango 1 on the move.</i>

12:42.922 --> 12:46.058
<i>Vehicle speed: 30 miles per hour.
Rear right passenger seat.</i>

12:46.158 --> 12:49.954
<i>Calvary is a go. Repeat.
Calvary is a go.</i>

13:00.314 --> 13:02.309
Stand by. Stand by. I have control.

13:24.113 --> 13:27.400
<i>Tango 1 down. Liftoff. Liftoff.</i>

13:40.755 --> 13:43.216
See you later, Annie.

13:47.078 --> 13:50.134
The latest reports
from the Democratic Republic of Congo,

13:50.234 --> 13:53.834
<i>where the unclaimed assassination
of the Minister of Mining</i>

13:53.934 --> 13:58.173
<i>has triggered violent confrontations
in the capital city of Kinshasa.</i>

13:58.889 --> 14:02.594
<i>Across the country, clashes between
government forces and rebels,</i>

14:02.893 --> 14:05.663
<i>along with indiscriminate raids
on civilian populations,</i>

14:05.763 --> 14:09.084
<i>have started again
with rising intensity.</i>

14:09.383 --> 14:13.496
<i>A country already crippled by corruption
in a decade of civil war</i>

14:13.596 --> 14:16.457
<i>descends even further into chaos.</i>

15:06.273 --> 15:07.892
<i>Bonjour.</i>

15:08.500 --> 15:10.207
<i>Bonjour.</i>

15:13.914 --> 15:15.400
Hey!

15:37.996 --> 15:39.857
Hey!

15:40.650 --> 15:43.252
Customs released the humanitarian
aid cargo yesterday,

15:43.352 --> 15:47.748
so we've just received this new shipment
of rice, canned food, and medical supplies.

15:47.848 --> 15:49.467
We need to extend our storage space

15:49.567 --> 15:51.620
and we're running a little short
on lumber, but it's not a problem.

15:51.819 --> 15:54.105
We've also received the water pumps
that Jim asked for,

15:54.205 --> 15:56.833
so he can now finish
setting up the water wells.

15:58.901 --> 16:01.679
Jim, you're up, but you know this meeting
is for department heads only.

16:01.779 --> 16:03.907
Oh. Forgive the liberty.
Eugene's my chainman.

16:04.731 --> 16:08.284
We are loading up on the remaining
pipe today, 150 feet of joint,

16:08.384 --> 16:11.864
push on, hit our mark on well bore
NLT this evening.

16:11.964 --> 16:14.792
As you were. No later than this evening.

16:14.892 --> 16:16.753
- We have CBM information?
- Eugene.

16:17.662 --> 16:20.439
Sitrep. Coal bed methane rating
is below standard

16:20.539 --> 16:23.693
and presents no risk of contamination
to the groundwater bed.

16:23.793 --> 16:25.679
But lots of clean water for my people.

16:25.978 --> 16:28.150
Thank you.

16:28.414 --> 16:31.376
I got a couple of teenagers back home
I'd like you to spend some time with.

16:31.476 --> 16:35.897
Jim has many qualities, but we still have
a security issue. Regarding surfing.

16:36.622 --> 16:38.891
Jim, come on. You've been here
for over a year now.

16:38.991 --> 16:41.445
You know security protocol
apply to all staff.

16:43.396 --> 16:47.659
Is that a new shirt?
Sorry. It's very pretty.

17:33.304 --> 17:36.291
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I'll pull it away.

17:42.054 --> 17:43.465
Okay, just...

18:26.139 --> 18:27.765
Jim!

18:41.989 --> 18:43.709
Eugene, stop.

20:06.031 --> 20:08.727
- Are there any more?
- No.

20:12.204 --> 20:15.933
Are you okay? Eugene, are you okay?

20:16.033 --> 20:17.302
- You sure?
- Yeah.

20:38.481 --> 20:42.357
Okay, Eugene, listen to me,
you did the right thing.

20:42.457 --> 20:46.330
You hear me? You did the right thing.
And now you're gonna do more, okay?

20:46.430 --> 20:48.941
Come on. Get all of our people back
to the compound.

20:49.041 --> 20:51.644
Tell Camille to lock down
all projects and all AOs.

20:51.744 --> 20:53.871
I'm gonna send a cab
back to the compound.

20:53.971 --> 20:57.233
Have security just throw my ruck
over the wall. Nobody goes outside.

20:57.333 --> 20:58.943
Then, tomorrow, when it's safe,

20:59.043 --> 21:01.112
have all the nationals reabsorb
into the community,

21:01.212 --> 21:03.615
go to emergency evac plan
for the expats.

21:03.856 --> 21:05.282
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

21:05.382 --> 21:06.851
- Are the keys in the Rover?
- Yeah. Sure.

21:06.951 --> 21:10.496
Okay. Give that to security.
Now can you do that?

21:10.596 --> 21:12.790
- I will take you to Kinshasa, Mr. Jim.
- No, no, no, Eugene.

21:12.890 --> 21:15.502
You've gotta do what I asked you to do
because you're the one who can do it.

21:15.701 --> 21:18.338
You understand? Okay.

21:18.737 --> 21:23.493
I've got a lot of respect for you, young man.
You saved my life. I'll never forget that.

22:07.653 --> 22:10.849
<i>Sierra 3, come in. Sierra 3.</i>

22:13.509 --> 22:16.245
<i>Don't let the target escape the X.</i>

22:22.818 --> 22:27.031
<i>Stand by. Stand by.
Confirm Tango 1 on the move.</i>

22:38.768 --> 22:40.363
<i>Calvary is a go.</i>

22:45.441 --> 22:49.963
<i>...and the crew, we'd like to welcome you
aboard this flight to London.</i>

24:28.377 --> 24:29.762
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

24:29.862 --> 24:31.948
- Hey. Jim Terrier.
- Terry.

24:33.466 --> 24:36.096
For fuck's sake. Oh, man.

24:36.196 --> 24:39.649
I heard you were living in London all
this time. You don't call, you don't write.

24:39.749 --> 24:42.525
- Yeah.
- Please, will you sit down?

24:42.625 --> 24:45.002
I'm surprised that they let you in,
looking like that.

24:45.102 --> 24:46.921
- Do you want a drink?
- No, thanks.

24:47.021 --> 24:50.892
Yeah, no, I was living in London
for several years

24:50.992 --> 24:54.621
after our escapade in Congo.

24:55.212 --> 24:58.373
Not a proud moment,
and I guess I felt awkward reaching out.

24:58.473 --> 25:02.244
Well, you always worried too much, Jim.
The past is the past, my friend.

25:02.344 --> 25:07.375
I see you lost the mustache. Looks good.
I never cared for the mustache on you.

25:08.834 --> 25:13.180
Boy, these are nice digs.
You've done well, huh?

25:13.280 --> 25:18.736
Me? Well, yeah. Company's expanded
since you retired, went multinational.

25:18.836 --> 25:22.899
Provides much more extensive services
now in machinery, weaponry, expertise.

25:22.999 --> 25:25.109
I don't know about you,
I just seem to travel all the time.

25:25.209 --> 25:29.605
Branches worldwide.
You see, no more Kevlar vests for me.

25:29.705 --> 25:33.326
I went from killer to cashier.
Don't tell anyone.

25:36.153 --> 25:38.513
You look worried, Jim. What is it?

25:38.989 --> 25:42.727
Terry, who all knew
about Project Calvary?

25:43.427 --> 25:47.340
- Why do you wanna dig up that history?
- I was in Congo for the last year.

25:47.440 --> 25:50.635
Yesterday, three indigs came after me,
specifically after me.

25:51.727 --> 25:54.307
Specifically after you?

25:57.842 --> 26:02.747
That's not good. Well, for all our sakes,
I hope you're wrong.

26:02.847 --> 26:06.308
Who knew about Calvary? You, me, Reed,
and Bryson. But we're all brothers.

26:06.408 --> 26:09.137
The clients knew, of course,
but who they were, I don't know.

26:09.237 --> 26:13.190
I mean, mining corporations,
politicians...

26:13.290 --> 26:16.427
That information was way above
my pay grade back then.

26:16.527 --> 26:20.072
Felix Marti was the only civilian
who knew about it.

26:20.172 --> 26:22.758
He was the only direct contact
with the clients.

26:22.858 --> 26:26.141
I think if your gut instinct is that
this trouble is related to Calvary,

26:26.241 --> 26:31.125
then we should both track down
Felix Marti, find out who's behind it.

26:31.225 --> 26:33.836
The last I heard,
he was back in Barcelona.

26:33.936 --> 26:36.019
I think I should track down
Reed and Bryson

26:36.119 --> 26:38.841
and give them the heads up.
I think they might be operating still.

26:38.941 --> 26:42.020
We should keep in contact about this.
How can I reach you?

26:42.219 --> 26:43.897
I'll call you.

26:44.196 --> 26:47.913
You keep your eyes open 'cause
they could be coming after you, too.

27:03.857 --> 27:05.444
<i>Terrier just walked out
of the company's building.</i>

27:10.389 --> 27:13.535
<i>Heading west towards the junction.
North side.</i>

27:14.818 --> 27:16.578
<i>Crossing the street now.</i>

27:18.089 --> 27:21.977
<i>Sunglasses, parka, camo backpack.
Oscar 1, he's coming your way.</i>

27:27.206 --> 27:31.670
<i>He's ex-Special Forces. Don't tail him
too close. He could spot you.</i>

27:44.716 --> 27:47.322
- <i>He's heading for the subway.</i>
- Stay with him?

27:47.422 --> 27:50.905
<i>Negative. Stand down.
We'll take it from here.</i>

28:06.470 --> 28:08.065
- Did you come alone?
- Well, what do you think?

28:08.664 --> 28:10.709
- How long have you known me?
- I mean, you're sure you weren't followed?

28:10.850 --> 28:13.536
After I received your message,
I caught two tubes,

28:13.636 --> 28:17.906
walked twice round Victoria Park,
like a fucking lunatic.

28:18.006 --> 28:20.193
What's going on?

28:21.585 --> 28:25.123
Jim, they're brain dead.
They only care about the match.

28:25.622 --> 28:29.134
Three pipe-hitters just tried
to take me down in Congo, Stan.

28:29.234 --> 28:31.462
Fuck me.

28:31.804 --> 28:33.305
What makes you think
they were after you?

28:33.405 --> 28:35.458
It's the Congo, for fuck's sake.
What do you expect?

28:35.558 --> 28:39.671
If we were to drop into Liberia tomorrow,
there'd be one or two feisty campers

28:39.812 --> 28:40.913
who'd wanna kick the shit
out of most white blokes.

28:41.013 --> 28:44.492
It wasn't regular army, Stanley,
it wasn't rebels, it wasn't FARDC.

28:45.284 --> 28:46.452
- All right.
- All right?

28:46.552 --> 28:48.438
Fucking cupcake.

28:51.039 --> 28:53.110
- You're paranoid?
- Yeah.

28:55.394 --> 28:59.582
Somebody wanted 50 ccs of me
for proof of kill. Is that paranoid?

28:59.682 --> 29:02.301
Whoever it is that sent those hitters,

29:02.401 --> 29:04.471
they've figured out by now
that I'm still alive.

29:04.970 --> 29:09.450
I need to find out who wants me dead
before they find me again.

29:10.910 --> 29:12.713
Well, Jim,

29:13.812 --> 29:16.507
I'll put you up for a job, right,
keep you off the grid.

29:16.607 --> 29:19.176
- It's black work, your type...
- No, I don't do that anymore.

29:19.276 --> 29:21.847
You don't do that anymore?
What the fuck do you want me to do?

29:21.988 --> 29:23.447
I just want you to keep your ear
to the ground,

29:23.547 --> 29:25.950
find out who's using SCARs,

29:26.050 --> 29:30.187
who's offering jobs in Congo,
who's asking questions about me.

29:30.287 --> 29:32.828
I gotta find out
why after all this time.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.152
I talked to Cox.
He hadn't heard anything.

29:36.252 --> 29:39.364
I wanna go to Barcelona
and get to Felix. Maybe he knows.

29:41.257 --> 29:45.778
Now, get me set up. I just need
24 to 48 hours, then I'll bump.

29:45.878 --> 29:47.164
I need you to set me up with a kit.

29:47.763 --> 29:50.807
You get compromised,
and I fucking go down with you,

29:50.907 --> 29:54.637
and I'm just beginning to enjoy
my pathetic little life here.

29:55.087 --> 29:56.214
Fucking...

29:56.714 --> 29:59.074
Drop me out, will you, mate?
That's twice you've done that now.

29:59.174 --> 30:02.244
Fucking shut up, granddad.
It's only a fucking pint.

30:02.344 --> 30:04.890
- You want some, I'll give it you.
- Granddad.

30:14.498 --> 30:17.394
Okay. Okay, I'm gonna get my jacket.

30:18.294 --> 30:19.738
Call the fucking pigs!

30:25.051 --> 30:27.203
Look at the fucking state of me.

30:27.303 --> 30:29.905
Every fucking time,
you have to chin someone.

30:30.005 --> 30:33.142
You'll end up doing
plenty of fucking time.

30:33.242 --> 30:35.970
I only wanted to see the fucking game.

30:36.814 --> 30:38.874
Jim?

30:40.650 --> 30:43.044
Are you all right?

30:46.697 --> 30:49.725
Jim, come here. Come here.

30:49.825 --> 30:52.980
- Something's wrong. Oh. My head.
- Jim, you all right?

30:53.579 --> 30:57.066
- My head.
- I've got you. I've got you.

30:58.434 --> 31:02.906
- Oh, fuck.
- Jim? I've got you.

31:08.444 --> 31:10.063
<i>Mr. Terrier.</i>

31:10.163 --> 31:13.599
The dizziness that you described,
have you had these episodes before?

31:13.699 --> 31:15.669
Chronic headaches, balance,
coordination issues?

31:15.968 --> 31:18.671
Headaches only. Headaches.
I don't sleep well.

31:18.771 --> 31:20.966
Memory? Any significant head trauma?

31:21.207 --> 31:25.637
Significant head trauma? No.
I forget things sometimes.

31:26.078 --> 31:28.272
I have to take notes
to remember details.

31:28.372 --> 31:31.234
- What's the scar above your right eye?
- Shrapnel.

31:31.483 --> 31:33.010
What was the cause
of the shrapnel injury?

31:33.110 --> 31:36.480
- IED.
- Oh, so nothing significant, then.

31:36.580 --> 31:40.569
Have you spent a lot of time near artillery
or loud concussive blasts?

31:41.727 --> 31:43.854
I suppose so, yeah.

31:43.954 --> 31:47.059
- Do you get mood swings, short temper?
- I'll attest to that.

31:48.459 --> 31:51.921
Right. What we're looking
at here, you see this?

31:52.021 --> 31:55.809
All this red area here,
that is amyloid plaque buildup.

31:56.308 --> 32:01.906
It's actually toxic to your brain,
and it's quite significant.

32:02.573 --> 32:04.676
Now, normally, this would indicate
early Alzheimer's,

32:04.817 --> 32:08.546
but given the nature of your collapse
tonight and your history,

32:08.646 --> 32:12.037
I'd say what this tells me is you're
suffering from post-concussion syndrome.

32:12.216 --> 32:14.827
It's head trauma of a cumulative nature.

32:14.927 --> 32:17.563
Now I certainly hope
you live a very long life,

32:17.663 --> 32:20.666
but this is a serious condition.

32:20.766 --> 32:23.527
This can lead to memory loss,
chronic depression,

32:23.627 --> 32:26.073
sometimes suicidal thoughts.

32:26.572 --> 32:27.532
Have you ever...

32:27.673 --> 32:31.503
No. No, I mean... No.
Just the headaches.

32:32.152 --> 32:34.380
So, what, I take drugs for this or...

32:34.480 --> 32:37.708
Well, I can prescribe you
a specific treatment for the headaches,

32:37.808 --> 32:42.381
but for the condition itself,
unfortunately, no, there's no drugs.

32:42.621 --> 32:45.725
Just take care of your mind. Certainly
avoid anything strenuous on your head,

32:45.825 --> 32:49.721
like rough sports,
loud concerts, East End pubs...

32:51.188 --> 32:55.102
Seriously, though, any more stresses
like this, and that is gonna get worse.

33:02.349 --> 33:03.777
Can you hold that for a second?

33:06.020 --> 33:08.197
That's really healthy.

33:08.297 --> 33:11.743
I'm going to Barcelona
with or without your help, Stan.

33:12.142 --> 33:14.028
Here.

33:24.138 --> 33:27.592
You're going to Barcelona when you know
it's an insane thing to do.

33:27.692 --> 33:30.094
You didn't listen
to what the doc said, did you?

33:30.194 --> 33:32.097
And you ain't done this job
for a long old time, mate.

33:32.438 --> 33:35.183
- Just get me a safe place in Barcelona.
- No.

33:35.482 --> 33:36.978
- But you're my friend.
- Yeah. And as your friend,

33:37.078 --> 33:41.231
I don't wanna see you dead in the gutter
with a bullet in the back of your head.

33:42.281 --> 33:43.958
You can't even catch a fucking lighter.

33:44.058 --> 33:46.444
Okay, once in Barcelona,
if I put down my credit card,

33:46.544 --> 33:50.196
put my name on a hotel registry, they're
gonna be onto me, and that'll be on you.

33:50.296 --> 33:51.950
What, you're gonna play
that fucking card with me now?

33:52.091 --> 33:55.620
I gotta go, Stan.
Do you hear me? I got to go.

34:03.077 --> 34:04.296
You know what?

34:05.396 --> 34:06.465
- Here.
- I don't want it.

34:06.605 --> 34:09.442
Well, fuck it, then.
You're out of your fucking mind.

34:09.542 --> 34:12.478
If that's what you want,
I'll set it up for you.

34:12.578 --> 34:14.764
I'll call you in the morning.

34:16.782 --> 34:20.751
<i>Jim, you know what?
I don't think you should go on your own.</i>

34:20.851 --> 34:24.023
<i>Why should you have all the fun
while I'm stuck here?</i>

34:24.123 --> 34:27.194
<i>I'll fly out after you
in case you need some backup.</i>

34:27.493 --> 34:31.281
<i>I've got some contacts in Barcelona,
friends of mine, ex-Spanish Legion,</i>

34:32.565 --> 34:34.368
<i>old dogs like me.</i>

34:34.766 --> 34:36.594
<i>No one pays attention to them anymore.</i>

34:36.694 --> 34:39.813
<i>They'll take good care of you,
get you a place, a car,</i>

34:39.913 --> 34:42.206
<i>everything you need.</i>

34:42.675 --> 34:44.335
<i>You'll be safe.</i>

38:36.308 --> 38:37.676
What I will tell you,

38:37.776 --> 38:41.681
and what I think all of our panelists
are indicating, is that...

38:42.380 --> 38:47.412
we must combine and target our efforts
with the goal of long-term societal...

38:47.853 --> 38:49.581
<i>Sierra 3, copy.</i>

38:52.572 --> 38:56.179
<i>Once the hit occurs, the shooter,
and the shooter only, is into the wind.</i>

38:56.279 --> 39:00.491
- <i>Off continent?</i>
- <i>Yeah, that's how Felix wants it.</i>

39:01.892 --> 39:04.596
The private sector
can no longer think only vertically,

39:04.737 --> 39:09.184
and the aid sector can no longer exist
with solely horizontal humanitarianism.

39:09.659 --> 39:11.220
What we need,
what we really need here...

39:11.369 --> 39:12.868
Is money.

39:16.499 --> 39:20.277
I was going to say...

39:21.328 --> 39:22.806
sir,

39:22.906 --> 39:24.729
is balance.

39:24.829 --> 39:26.451
Balance...

39:30.096 --> 39:32.247
When our mission...

39:32.347 --> 39:35.531
is of greater...

39:36.135 --> 39:40.323
service to ourselves than to
our clients or beneficiaries,

39:40.423 --> 39:44.136
then we're destined to failure.
It's balance. It's balance.

39:51.047 --> 39:53.353
Out. Out.

40:01.185 --> 40:03.989
- You're in Spain.
- And you're in a swanky suit.

40:04.730 --> 40:06.016
Jim, why are you here?

40:09.652 --> 40:11.837
- I think you know.
- No, I don't.

40:11.937 --> 40:13.865
Believe me, I don't.
What can I do for you?

40:14.006 --> 40:16.168
Someone tried to kill me
three days ago in Congo.

40:16.642 --> 40:21.340
Oh, wow. What is that, your book title?
It's pretty good, actually.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.633
You're all writing memoirs these days.

40:24.233 --> 40:27.679
But why were you in Congo? Why?
Didn't we do them enough harm?

40:28.078 --> 40:30.589
I was drilling wells.

40:31.215 --> 40:33.904
- I was working for an NGO.
- Really?

40:34.004 --> 40:37.939
Yeah, really. Not all of us
wanna turn our sin into profit.

40:40.249 --> 40:41.526
Really?

40:42.284 --> 40:45.072
Well, let me tell you,
I don't believe a word you're saying.

40:45.571 --> 40:49.133
I believe you're here because you think
Annie will leave me to be with you.

40:49.233 --> 40:52.916
And I would be most welcoming
of the humiliation you would suffer

40:53.016 --> 40:56.140
in attempting to take her.
Is that clear?

40:56.240 --> 41:00.152
She is a remarkable woman, Jim.
Remarkable.

41:00.770 --> 41:02.381
But when you told me to look after her,

41:02.580 --> 41:05.217
you didn't actually expect her to wait
for a man who walked away?

41:05.358 --> 41:07.426
She's my wife,

41:07.526 --> 41:08.844
and she will remain so.

41:08.944 --> 41:12.682
That said, we can play along
in this fairy tale, but then why would I...

41:12.782 --> 41:15.384
Don't fuck with me, Felix.
We were all part of the operation.

41:15.484 --> 41:18.105
I mean, you did your part, I did mine.
We all found a way to justify it.

41:18.404 --> 41:22.608
Listen, it's been many years since I spoke
to anybody we worked with back then.

41:22.708 --> 41:24.960
I'm running my own place here now,
as you can see.

41:25.060 --> 41:26.362
I'm running my own enterprise.

41:26.462 --> 41:29.365
And neither of us can afford to do
anything but forget that project.

41:29.465 --> 41:33.228
- It never happened.
- That's the way you wanna play it, Felix?

41:34.169 --> 41:35.747
With me?

41:37.181 --> 41:40.752
Oh, God. Okay, okay, this is
what I'll do for you, soldier boy.

41:41.368 --> 41:45.423
I'll go to some of my stateside sources,
and I'll find out what I can.

41:45.523 --> 41:48.593
And whatever I find,
I will give to you, okay?

41:53.939 --> 41:58.269
We're gonna start over again here, Jim.
Yeah, civilly.

41:58.369 --> 42:01.365
Join Annie and I for dinner tonight.

42:01.714 --> 42:03.508
Murgola Restaurant? 10:00 p.m.

42:04.909 --> 42:06.261
I'm sure she'd love to see you.

42:08.387 --> 42:09.888
I came here to talk to you.

42:09.988 --> 42:12.912
If that were the case,
you'd have called.

43:18.107 --> 43:20.054
Jim!

43:20.453 --> 43:22.368
Welcome.

43:22.845 --> 43:23.855
Sit down.

43:24.246 --> 43:26.628
I need a chair, please.

43:28.166 --> 43:29.945
He didn't...

43:31.537 --> 43:32.698
You didn't tell her.

43:33.038 --> 43:35.242
No, I didn't tell her.
It was a surprise.

43:35.941 --> 43:39.470
As it was a surprise for me
to see you this afternoon.

43:41.130 --> 43:43.666
What are you doing here?

43:43.766 --> 43:48.005
Our old friend has had some, what,
trouble back in the stomping grounds.

43:48.688 --> 43:51.048
And you know what?
I have a lot of information for you.

43:51.148 --> 43:54.677
For both of us, actually.
But before any of that,

43:54.777 --> 43:57.389
we have a surprise, right,
we'd like to share with him?

43:57.688 --> 43:59.558
- We have champagne.
- Felix, stop.

43:59.857 --> 44:05.063
Felix, what? Felix, what? Pretty soon,
we'll be saying, "Felix Junior, stop."

44:05.204 --> 44:06.494
Stop!

44:06.594 --> 44:08.846
What? What happened? What... Sorry.

44:08.946 --> 44:11.046
Am I missing anything?

44:11.368 --> 44:13.688
Why is everyone so tense? I mean...

44:13.838 --> 44:17.116
if you think of the coincidence
of all of this, you should not be tense.

44:17.216 --> 44:19.878
A dear and old friend arrives in town

44:20.019 --> 44:22.788
just as we are formalizing
the adoption of our first child.

44:22.888 --> 44:25.891
- I think it's a reason enough to...
- Stop.

44:25.991 --> 44:27.419
- Sit down.
- You're humiliating me.

44:27.560 --> 44:29.463
No, the way you stared at him
humiliates you.

44:29.662 --> 44:31.423
Enough. That's enough.

44:41.006 --> 44:43.234
Proud of yourself?

45:02.361 --> 45:03.272
Annie!

45:05.364 --> 45:07.943
Annie! Annie, please.

45:08.043 --> 45:11.287
- Just wait one second.
- What? What?

45:11.387 --> 45:13.965
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you knew.

45:15.608 --> 45:19.930
That you were here in Barcelona?
That you were coming to dinner?

45:20.629 --> 45:23.019
I'm sorry.

45:24.283 --> 45:27.537
It's easy to say now, isn't it, James?

45:30.723 --> 45:33.526
Just tell Felix if he still wants to
give me the information that he got,

45:33.626 --> 45:37.622
I'll be at 93 Calle Hercules,
apartment 4D.

47:54.175 --> 47:56.336
- You moved back to London?
- Yeah.

47:56.635 --> 48:00.132
But I had been in DRC,
where I spent the past year,

48:00.531 --> 48:03.468
helping out, following your lead.

48:07.011 --> 48:08.885
Don't.

48:10.398 --> 48:13.353
You come here and you want
to talk about eight years ago.

48:15.327 --> 48:18.817
Really, Jim, what did you think
was gonna happen?

48:18.958 --> 48:20.267
You coming here?

48:20.367 --> 48:23.085
I came back here 'cause somebody's
trying to kill me, and it's got to do

48:23.185 --> 48:25.490
with what happened that made me
have to leave in the first place.

48:25.789 --> 48:27.367
And what was that, Jim?

48:34.006 --> 48:35.950
Of course.

48:36.050 --> 48:38.378
You never told me
about what you did then,

48:39.077 --> 48:42.341
so why would you start now?

48:43.190 --> 48:45.802
I had to leave. I had no choice.

48:47.253 --> 48:50.223
And I don't need an explanation.
I really don't.

48:50.923 --> 48:53.359
We are different people now.

48:53.459 --> 48:55.738
I'm trying to be.

48:57.730 --> 48:59.764
What do you see in him?

49:00.464 --> 49:04.695
If a firefighter saves you from a fire,
there is a debt.

49:04.795 --> 49:07.473
Felix was there for me
when you disappeared.

49:07.573 --> 49:10.052
He did everything
he could to protect me.

49:10.251 --> 49:13.012
I've tried to pay the debt
with marriage.

49:13.112 --> 49:17.167
I'm still paying,
and he's still collecting.

49:44.735 --> 49:47.463
Felix asked me to come.

49:48.289 --> 49:50.158
He is apologetic for what happened,

49:50.457 --> 49:55.521
and he seems to think the information
he has for you is important.

49:56.722 --> 50:00.993
This is the address
of our home in the country.

50:01.952 --> 50:05.590
Join us for lunch tomorrow at 2:00?

50:08.167 --> 50:10.054
Yeah.

50:52.686 --> 50:55.185
Peek-a-boo!

51:01.487 --> 51:06.634
Romeo. Romeo. Romeo.

51:06.734 --> 51:09.210
Annie said you wanted to see me.

51:10.271 --> 51:11.464
Let's go inside.

51:11.564 --> 51:16.495
It took me a few phone calls, but I managed
to dig up some interesting stuff.

51:18.262 --> 51:20.206
Yeah, it seems you may be right.

51:20.306 --> 51:23.585
There is something going on in connection
with what we did back then.

51:23.984 --> 51:24.920
What is that?

51:30.358 --> 51:34.096
- Do you wanna get that?
- No, no, no, no.

51:34.295 --> 51:37.220
I think it's more important
we finish our conversation.

51:37.320 --> 51:40.143
Do you... Are you hungry?
Do you wanna eat something?

51:40.426 --> 51:43.010
Mercedez, please bring something to eat.

51:43.110 --> 51:46.511
- No, I'm not hungry.
- Okay.

51:47.750 --> 51:49.778
Stop. Stop.

51:50.377 --> 51:52.781
- Will you stop, please? Come on...
- Will Annie be joining us?

51:55.483 --> 52:00.888
Annie... Annie is riding,
always with her horses.

52:03.841 --> 52:06.285
What were we talking about?

52:06.385 --> 52:09.522
Yes, for you to be a target,

52:09.622 --> 52:13.209
you must have more information
than just your memory, right, Jim?

52:13.309 --> 52:16.981
What do you keep? A diary?
Do you keep a diary?

52:17.081 --> 52:19.840
A diary of the horror we created?

52:19.940 --> 52:22.561
With the blood of all these...

52:22.661 --> 52:27.264
women and grandpas and all
those baby ones, little ones,

52:27.364 --> 52:31.919
floating in the river beside their toys.
And you keep a diary of that?

52:32.019 --> 52:33.318
We have to look forward, Jim.

52:33.579 --> 52:37.608
Looking back, all we're doing
is fucking and killing like animals.

52:37.708 --> 52:40.762
And you know a lot about that,
especially about fucking and killing.

52:46.600 --> 52:51.656
- I'm going to get a shower.
- Yeah, you better get a shower.

52:53.207 --> 52:55.335
Right, Jim?

53:03.759 --> 53:05.436
You asked me here
to give me some information,

53:05.536 --> 53:09.457
- so give me the fucking information.
- Here's the information, right here.

53:09.557 --> 53:12.309
It appears your old friends and me

53:12.409 --> 53:15.613
are on a congressional subpoena list.

53:15.713 --> 53:18.575
It shouldn't be long before we have
Interpol on our backs.

53:18.716 --> 53:22.578
"Into events in Kinshasa,
Democratic Republic of Congo in 2006."

53:22.678 --> 53:24.706
Well, that was only a matter of time.

53:26.390 --> 53:29.460
I see Cox is on the list.
What about Reed and Bryson?

53:29.560 --> 53:31.520
Well, that's an interesting part
of the story.

53:31.620 --> 53:35.166
I found obituaries
for both Reed and Bryson.

53:35.266 --> 53:38.703
Of the three shooters,
you're the only one left.

53:57.621 --> 53:59.796
What are you looking at?

53:59.896 --> 54:01.492
Oh. Do you remember Stan Edgerton?

54:01.592 --> 54:04.621
- Who?
- My friend Stanley. You met him.

54:05.020 --> 54:06.089
No, I don't recall.

54:06.189 --> 54:09.008
He worked with the company
with Cox and I before Congo.

54:09.108 --> 54:13.462
We did joint taskforce in Liberia.
He happened to be in Barcelona.

54:13.562 --> 54:15.122
And I hope you don't mind,
I gave him your address.

54:15.222 --> 54:18.969
He's gonna come out here
and we're gonna go hunting from here.

54:21.145 --> 54:22.597
Hunting? For what?

54:24.273 --> 54:26.727
Whatever's in season.
I just need to shoot something.

54:27.593 --> 54:30.439
- They should be here any minute now.
- But when are they...

54:35.626 --> 54:38.155
But who...

54:38.621 --> 54:40.115
They? Who are they?

54:40.414 --> 54:44.243
They, Stan and a couple of U.S. Marines
from the embassy who had a day off

54:44.343 --> 54:46.654
and wanted to shoot something, too.

54:46.754 --> 54:49.616
No. I can't believe it.

54:51.467 --> 54:53.686
You all right?

54:53.786 --> 54:55.788
Okay.

54:56.288 --> 54:58.241
Fine.

55:03.045 --> 55:05.223
Are you trying to say something?

55:05.623 --> 55:09.010
- You're saying what?
- We have to go. It's all fucked now.

55:09.593 --> 55:12.189
- I should use the bathroom. Do you mind?
- Why would I mind?

55:15.241 --> 55:18.011
I'm feeling the balance might be lost.

55:18.302 --> 55:20.930
Where is it, now? Okay.

55:24.116 --> 55:25.143
Fuck.

55:27.419 --> 55:30.164
What did you tell 'em? That my friends
were coming with a car full of guns?

55:30.264 --> 55:33.085
What did you think would happen
when you asked me to get information?

55:36.512 --> 55:38.990
You cannot take her.

55:39.090 --> 55:41.901
She's mine. She's my wife.

55:42.001 --> 55:45.108
Ask her, who was there for her?

55:45.988 --> 55:48.958
Why did you come back
into our lives, Jim? Why?

55:49.058 --> 55:51.936
Get up. Move. Come on.

55:52.495 --> 55:54.997
- I can't let you take her away from me.
- Which way?

55:55.097 --> 55:57.157
- Annie?
- What's going on?

55:57.257 --> 55:59.319
- Annie!
- She's my wife. She's my wife.

56:00.811 --> 56:03.247
Get dressed. Get dressed.
You gotta get dressed, darling.

56:03.347 --> 56:04.940
Felix? What happened to your face?

56:05.040 --> 56:06.743
- Annie, no!
- What did you do to him?

56:07.042 --> 56:09.404
Get your clothes on, now.
Get your clothes on.

56:09.504 --> 56:12.123
Yes, get dressed.
For Christ's sake, get dressed.

56:12.223 --> 56:14.367
Will someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

56:14.467 --> 56:16.443
He set me up,
but he's too drunk to understand

56:16.543 --> 56:18.713
- they're gonna try to kill all of us.
- Kill?

56:18.813 --> 56:21.082
They were going to take him
when he left the house,

56:21.182 --> 56:23.217
but he fucked it all up for hunting.

56:23.317 --> 56:26.345
There's nobody coming, Felix,
no hunting party.

56:28.164 --> 56:31.392
How many are there? How many? How many?

56:31.492 --> 56:35.705
What difference does it make now, Jim?
What difference does it make?

56:35.805 --> 56:38.291
Felix, what did you do? What did you do?

56:38.391 --> 56:40.402
Annie, get down!

56:40.502 --> 56:43.543
Listen, we are going to be attacked.
I gotta get us out of here.

56:43.643 --> 56:45.489
- Just do what I say. Do you understand?
- Where are you? Where are you?

56:45.589 --> 56:47.742
- Just do what I say.
- Jim. Annie.

56:47.842 --> 56:50.261
Wasn't this what you both always wanted?
I mean, you made it.

56:50.361 --> 56:53.389
You're finally back together.
You may well have children together.

56:53.489 --> 56:54.946
That would be heaven.
But you were right...

56:55.046 --> 56:57.475
- Felix, we gotta go.
- Hell. Hell don't forget us.

56:57.575 --> 57:00.379
- It's in our hands.
- Okay, okay, we'll do all that later.

57:00.479 --> 57:03.090
- It's on our hands, James.
- Stop, Felix! We've gotta go!

57:03.190 --> 57:04.734
You're never gonna be happy, Jim.

57:04.834 --> 57:06.552
- Stay down.
- And I am sorry to tell you now.

57:07.152 --> 57:11.349
This hell we created
is gonna be with you always!

57:11.449 --> 57:13.724
- We will never be able to leave this life.
- Get down.

57:13.824 --> 57:16.604
- Or do you think you can escape it?
- Felix, get down! Get down!

57:16.704 --> 57:19.191
Let the real hunt begin!

57:24.754 --> 57:26.976
Fuck it.

57:37.867 --> 57:39.086
To happiness.

57:40.244 --> 57:43.286
To your goddamn fucking happiness.

57:45.340 --> 57:47.394
Felix, don't!

57:47.494 --> 57:49.067
Felix!

57:57.327 --> 57:58.814
Felix. Felix.

58:00.072 --> 58:02.199
Annie, he's gone.
There's nothing you can do for him.

58:02.299 --> 58:04.961
They're gonna come for us.
We've gotta go.

58:05.444 --> 58:07.622
Now.

58:11.909 --> 58:14.995
<i>Bravo Team to leader. We're moving in.</i>

58:16.814 --> 58:17.916
Stay close.

58:18.907 --> 58:20.502
Stay calm. Calm.

58:24.605 --> 58:27.118
Stay there. Stay there.

58:30.677 --> 58:33.806
Annie, do you have another car? Shit.

58:34.773 --> 58:38.052
Come on. We gotta go. Come on. Come on!

59:42.775 --> 59:45.135
<i>Master bedroom clear.</i>

59:55.104 --> 59:57.432
<i>Main floor is clear.</i>

01:00:06.399 --> 01:00:08.193
Come on, shut up!

01:00:47.673 --> 01:00:48.756
Go!

01:00:53.153 --> 01:00:55.584
Circle them. Go to the other side.

01:01:09.011 --> 01:01:10.496
Come on.

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:20.940
Jim Terrier, I heard
great things about you.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.311
You were quite a marksman back in the day.
It seems you haven't lost your touch.

01:01:25.427 --> 01:01:29.457
- <i>They're trapped in the bathroom.</i>
- <i>Copy that. I'm heading to the roof.</i>

01:01:29.557 --> 01:01:33.486
I know every room in this house.
You have one skylight, this door.

01:01:33.786 --> 01:01:37.073
You've got nowhere to go.
And I know you're not alone.

01:01:37.573 --> 01:01:42.203
His wife is with you, Annie.
We just want you, not her.

01:01:42.303 --> 01:01:45.373
So give yourself up,
and we will let the girl go.

01:01:45.973 --> 01:01:48.006
You care for her, no?

01:01:48.106 --> 01:01:50.604
Open the door
and she will walk away from this.

01:01:54.029 --> 01:01:57.059
Who sent you? Who do you work for?

01:01:57.159 --> 01:01:58.553
Why?

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:03.642
You wonder why your past
comes back to haunt you?

01:02:06.836 --> 01:02:07.853
I guess your little bitch

01:02:07.953 --> 01:02:10.482
must be wondering how she got
caught up in that slaughter, too.

01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:14.861
And now you're ready
to sacrifice an innocent woman?

01:02:22.417 --> 01:02:24.392
Okay. Okay.

01:04:28.903 --> 01:04:31.164
We need to change cars.
They'll be all over us.

01:04:37.269 --> 01:04:40.798
It's in here. It belongs to a farmer,
a friend of Felix.

01:04:41.098 --> 01:04:45.169
Felix always wanted to buy this car,
but he wouldn't sell it.

01:04:45.711 --> 01:04:47.471
Hope it runs as good as it looks.

01:04:47.671 --> 01:04:51.350
Who are these people?
What's going on, Jim?

01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:55.022
- What was Felix talking about?
- Felix was drunk. He was delusional.

01:04:55.421 --> 01:04:57.147
Don't lie to me!

01:04:58.957 --> 01:05:01.778
I'm not moving until you explain.

01:05:02.694 --> 01:05:04.351
Tell me, Jim.

01:05:05.773 --> 01:05:06.700
Please.

01:05:22.706 --> 01:05:25.242
We did some bad things.

01:05:27.978 --> 01:05:30.349
I did some bad things.

01:05:32.566 --> 01:05:33.727
Tell me.

01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:39.285
Cox,

01:05:40.366 --> 01:05:42.224
me,

01:05:43.769 --> 01:05:46.497
a couple of others from the company.

01:05:46.997 --> 01:05:50.117
We weren't just laying an airfield
and doing protection for an NGO.

01:05:50.217 --> 01:05:52.286
We had...

01:05:52.862 --> 01:05:55.039
a parallel contract
with a mining interest.

01:05:55.139 --> 01:05:57.450
Felix was the liaison.

01:05:57.550 --> 01:06:01.312
We were supplying arms
to the rebels, training.

01:06:02.246 --> 01:06:05.883
The company would get its piece
of the pie from the resources.

01:06:06.083 --> 01:06:09.446
It should have been
a clean contract, but...

01:06:10.196 --> 01:06:12.791
it didn't work out that way.

01:06:14.175 --> 01:06:16.019
And why did you leave me?

01:06:19.638 --> 01:06:21.969
It was me.

01:06:23.809 --> 01:06:26.613
I'm the one that killed
the Mining Minister.

01:06:30.149 --> 01:06:32.016
The contract with the company

01:06:32.116 --> 01:06:35.513
dictated that the shooter leave
the continent, so I left the continent.

01:06:35.613 --> 01:06:39.292
I thought I'd come back, I thought
things would improve, but they didn't.

01:06:39.392 --> 01:06:42.661
I watched the event playing out on TV,
tried to reach you.

01:06:42.761 --> 01:06:45.156
Felix told me you were safe.

01:06:47.266 --> 01:06:49.261
And I just couldn't...

01:06:50.736 --> 01:06:53.964
I felt so trapped. Annie...

01:06:55.674 --> 01:07:01.013
I thought about you every second.
I know I abandoned you.

01:07:01.113 --> 01:07:07.078
It's the biggest mistake I ever made.
I just... I couldn't face you after that.

01:07:07.686 --> 01:07:10.656
But I loved you every second.

01:07:10.756 --> 01:07:14.527
I can't ask you to forgive me.
I can't expect anything.

01:07:21.325 --> 01:07:22.461
What about now?

01:07:24.036 --> 01:07:26.256
I have to get some things
from the apartment,

01:07:27.189 --> 01:07:30.609
<i>and then we'll go someplace
where I can hide you.</i>

01:07:30.709 --> 01:07:32.927
<i>A safe place.</i>

01:07:53.323 --> 01:07:55.596
Okay, slide over.

01:07:57.219 --> 01:07:59.163
Okay, you're gonna drive in circles.

01:07:59.363 --> 01:08:02.708
Four right turns, turn around,
four left turns. Just keep doing that.

01:08:02.808 --> 01:08:05.337
If anyone looks at you too long,
you leave me.

01:08:05.761 --> 01:08:09.341
Okay? If you don't hear from me
in 15 minutes, you leave me.

01:08:12.868 --> 01:08:15.480
Go. Go. Go, go.

01:12:26.755 --> 01:12:27.599
Jim.

01:12:29.016 --> 01:12:30.718
Drive.

01:12:32.561 --> 01:12:34.890
- What happened?
- Nothing to worry about.

01:12:35.031 --> 01:12:39.269
Just drive until you can't drive anymore.
I have a friend who's gonna help us.

01:13:35.775 --> 01:13:38.120
You must be Annie. Come here.

01:13:39.178 --> 01:13:40.289
Meet Stanley.

01:13:43.199 --> 01:13:46.295
What? I told you I couldn't
leave you on your own.

01:13:49.071 --> 01:13:51.574
Right, there's mange and <i>vino</i> in there.

01:13:51.674 --> 01:13:53.902
I'll hide the car.

01:13:55.294 --> 01:13:57.723
<i>You're lucky I've got lots
of friends in Spain.</i>

01:14:01.241 --> 01:14:04.044
- Now...
- I'm gonna go.

01:14:04.244 --> 01:14:06.992
- Night, darling.
- Good night.

01:14:45.052 --> 01:14:46.521
You gotta go back home, Jim,

01:14:46.921 --> 01:14:51.500
notify Interpol or the DOJ,
tell 'em exactly where you are.

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.753
Call your attorney.
Turn yourself over to him.

01:14:53.853 --> 01:14:56.181
It's the one shot you got.

01:14:58.290 --> 01:15:00.635
It's the one shot she's got.

01:15:00.776 --> 01:15:04.647
I got three dead in the DRC, another five
or six at Felix's house in the country,

01:15:04.747 --> 01:15:06.782
and then two, boom, in Barcelona,

01:15:06.882 --> 01:15:10.879
most likely Spanish citizens,
killed by an American in Spain.

01:15:12.079 --> 01:15:14.166
All Spanish.

01:15:17.793 --> 01:15:20.188
All right, here's what I've found.

01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:22.341
The company's got an LLC,

01:15:22.998 --> 01:15:28.688
some kind of fucking import/export
cover called Aquila Corp.

01:15:29.188 --> 01:15:30.906
It's running their black ops.

01:15:31.006 --> 01:15:34.353
They're using a lot of Spaniards
'cause it's operating out of Gibraltar.

01:15:35.436 --> 01:15:37.346
Oh, I got another one for you.

01:15:37.446 --> 01:15:40.908
It's managed by your friend, Cox.

01:15:43.152 --> 01:15:47.156
Word is, the company's in line
for a new deal.

01:15:47.256 --> 01:15:48.608
Pentagon-size shit, you know.

01:15:49.308 --> 01:15:53.963
Anything resurfacing from the past,
any indictment, will fuck 'em right up.

01:15:54.863 --> 01:15:56.966
So they're clearing house.

01:15:57.066 --> 01:16:01.804
And you're first in line with Bryson
and Reed. Two down, one to fucking go.

01:16:02.204 --> 01:16:05.509
With Felix dead,
guess who stays in the game?

01:17:19.290 --> 01:17:21.943
I got you a clean car.

01:17:22.393 --> 01:17:24.421
Catch.

01:17:25.963 --> 01:17:28.733
Here you are.
It's parked 'round the side.

01:17:31.043 --> 01:17:33.329
Jim, you all right?

01:17:33.763 --> 01:17:35.164
- Yeah.
- You sure?

01:17:35.264 --> 01:17:37.199
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:17:37.299 --> 01:17:39.168
Get her to the police
and get yourself out of Dodge.

01:17:39.268 --> 01:17:42.354
If the shit goes down,
you haven't heard from me.

01:17:42.938 --> 01:17:44.441
Well, you let me hear from you.

01:17:47.276 --> 01:17:50.422
- Come on. You call me, right?
- Yeah.

01:17:51.806 --> 01:17:54.016
<i>You've got a long drive ahead of you.</i>

01:17:54.116 --> 01:17:56.852
<i>You're already exhausted. You're sick.</i>

01:17:56.952 --> 01:17:59.562
<i>So don't do anything stupid.</i>

01:17:59.662 --> 01:18:01.600
<i>Don't expect a friendly welcome anymore.</i>

01:18:36.734 --> 01:18:38.812
Need a light?

01:18:45.751 --> 01:18:48.229
Mind if I sit down?

01:18:49.989 --> 01:18:52.547
I think I might have one with you.

01:18:55.077 --> 01:18:58.948
You ever have one of those days
when every law is Murphy's Law?

01:19:00.683 --> 01:19:04.820
Everything's going wrong and everybody
wants to kill you for something.

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:07.323
You know, my wife's been on me
for weeks now

01:19:07.423 --> 01:19:10.067
to finish this tree house
in the garden for the kids, you know.

01:19:10.167 --> 01:19:14.239
One bloody tree and about 30 inches
where I can get the ladder in

01:19:14.339 --> 01:19:17.856
before I run into my wife's garden.

01:19:20.837 --> 01:19:23.881
- You a tourist?
- Something like that.

01:19:25.908 --> 01:19:28.236
Yeah.

01:19:29.353 --> 01:19:32.290
Got some heavy shit
going on up there today.

01:19:32.615 --> 01:19:34.058
- Is that right?
- Oh, yeah.

01:19:34.358 --> 01:19:38.704
One of the companies in that building
got a surprise visit from Interpol.

01:19:38.804 --> 01:19:41.182
You know Interpol?

01:19:43.197 --> 01:19:45.378
You know, I think
if I went home right now

01:19:45.478 --> 01:19:50.149
and, with the little space that I've got,
but I put my mind to it,

01:19:50.249 --> 01:19:54.103
I could finish that tree house
lickety-split, you know?

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:57.861
Sometimes we make
our problems bigger when we...

01:19:57.961 --> 01:20:01.652
we put off doing it the right way
the first time round.

01:20:04.054 --> 01:20:06.917
Then they just get harder
and harder to face.

01:20:08.109 --> 01:20:09.427
You think?

01:20:10.231 --> 01:20:12.146
I do.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:16.151
And guess what? I think a smart bloke
like you thinks so, too.

01:20:23.349 --> 01:20:25.251
Here's what I'm gonna do.

01:20:25.351 --> 01:20:27.228
'Cause I'm sure you've got
your own tree house to build,

01:20:27.328 --> 01:20:29.748
but if you ever wanna
build one together,

01:20:35.736 --> 01:20:36.822
let me know.

01:20:39.089 --> 01:20:41.910
And by the way, if I were you,
I wouldn't play in that tree house today.

01:20:43.819 --> 01:20:48.165
Termites. And they wanna bite off
more than your hand.

01:20:48.816 --> 01:20:49.976
Get my drift, cowboy?

01:21:18.946 --> 01:21:21.374
- <i>Aquila Corp.</i>
- <i>Terrance Cox's office, please.</i>

01:21:21.574 --> 01:21:22.826
<i>Putting you through.</i>

01:21:26.262 --> 01:21:28.013
Terrance Cox's office.
How may I help you?

01:21:28.113 --> 01:21:30.049
<i>Give Mr. Cox the following message.</i>

01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:35.237
Tell him JT will meet him
at the Oceana Aquarium in one hour.

01:21:35.337 --> 01:21:37.532
One hour.

01:22:04.425 --> 01:22:06.811
It's good to see you, Jim.

01:22:06.911 --> 01:22:09.989
I understand it's been
a rough couple of days.

01:22:10.623 --> 01:22:13.567
- For me or for you?
- That's a good question.

01:22:13.667 --> 01:22:18.172
Seems like the past has got us
by the short hairs. <i>C'est la vie,</i> huh?

01:22:18.272 --> 01:22:20.650
We made some choices then.
We have to make some new ones now.

01:22:23.719 --> 01:22:25.739
Walk with me.

01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:36.790
Terry Cox, my goodness.

01:22:36.890 --> 01:22:39.769
I did the same thing. Have you brought
the children back for more?

01:22:39.869 --> 01:22:42.914
Hello, Ruth. No. No children today.

01:22:43.014 --> 01:22:46.542
Our kids play together.
They love the sharks.

01:22:50.062 --> 01:22:53.041
Think I'm going soft, digging wells?
You think I'm fucking stupid, Terry?

01:22:58.838 --> 01:23:02.742
You set me up!
You forgotten we trained together?

01:23:19.775 --> 01:23:20.903
Ruth?

01:23:37.434 --> 01:23:40.429
I didn't wanna do this kind
of shit anymore!

01:23:40.529 --> 01:23:43.366
For somebody who doesn't
wanna do this kind of shit anymore,

01:23:43.466 --> 01:23:45.868
your kill ratio's pretty fucking high.

01:23:45.968 --> 01:23:49.865
Terry, just you and me,
how do we fix this?

01:23:51.207 --> 01:23:52.959
Fix this?

01:23:54.810 --> 01:23:56.863
Ruth.

01:24:00.791 --> 01:24:02.927
All right, let's move.
They can't be very far.

01:24:03.027 --> 01:24:05.936
We'll go all the way around the aquarium.
You take the main entrance.

01:24:06.036 --> 01:24:08.454
Let's go. Go!

01:24:08.554 --> 01:24:11.302
I'm wondering what exactly
it is you wanna fix, Jim.

01:24:11.402 --> 01:24:15.673
I did everything I could
to clean up after Calvary.

01:24:15.773 --> 01:24:18.434
Personally, I don't think the pieces
can be put together,

01:24:18.534 --> 01:24:21.646
legally, I mean, but it's not my call.

01:24:22.421 --> 01:24:24.348
Interpol?

01:24:25.341 --> 01:24:27.998
Congressional hearings? The subpoena?

01:24:28.098 --> 01:24:30.972
That's a bit cumbersome, isn't it?

01:24:31.263 --> 01:24:34.600
But with Reed and Bryson in the ground,
I can see the company's perspective.

01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:38.904
You're the last objective.
You're the last real threat on the table.

01:24:39.004 --> 01:24:40.489
Yeah, lucky me.

01:24:40.589 --> 01:24:43.151
You were the team leader, Terry.
Why just Bryson, Reed, and me?

01:24:45.069 --> 01:24:47.930
I don't know.

01:24:48.030 --> 01:24:51.717
I think the company
values my consistency.

01:24:51.817 --> 01:24:54.389
You do play the numbers.

01:24:54.489 --> 01:24:56.084
Yeah. Let me ask you...

01:24:56.184 --> 01:25:00.294
what does humanity pay
a well-intentioned well digger these days?

01:25:01.210 --> 01:25:04.355
Or is that a penance, Saint Jim?

01:25:06.549 --> 01:25:08.200
<i>Do you ever think about...</i>

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.339
Do you ever reflect on what we do?

01:25:17.893 --> 01:25:21.939
You're still living the dream, Jim?

01:25:22.039 --> 01:25:23.400
War and peace.

01:25:24.608 --> 01:25:25.877
Fucking joke.

01:25:28.045 --> 01:25:32.708
Did you think you'd find peace
being peaceful, Jim?

01:25:33.208 --> 01:25:35.478
You crack me up.

01:25:35.578 --> 01:25:38.214
There's war and there's purpose.

01:25:39.014 --> 01:25:42.818
Expand territory,
access vital resources.

01:25:43.318 --> 01:25:44.796
Don't slip, now.

01:25:55.197 --> 01:25:59.569
You and me, we're war fighters, mate.
We've served a grander purpose, haven't we?

01:26:00.069 --> 01:26:05.150
War fighters execute the will
of faceless power, the unknown.

01:26:09.612 --> 01:26:11.089
You don't look well, Jim.

01:26:15.242 --> 01:26:19.630
You don't wanna do this shit anymore?
You don't have to stay in this fight.

01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:23.593
At a certain point,
you've gotta stop the pain,

01:26:23.993 --> 01:26:27.930
die like a soldier,
make the ultimate sacrifice.

01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:30.558
I can see you're there.

01:26:31.258 --> 01:26:35.179
I see it in your eyes.
I've seen it before.

01:26:35.746 --> 01:26:37.140
You want out.

01:26:41.852 --> 01:26:43.789
What you got there, Jim?

01:26:48.784 --> 01:26:51.454
Those are the tail numbers.

01:26:51.654 --> 01:26:55.925
I have the manifest to every plane,
every weapon we flew in,

01:26:56.025 --> 01:27:00.138
every asset we flew out.
I also kept things on Project Calvary.

01:27:02.565 --> 01:27:05.535
So what you gonna do with this?
Give it to a newspaper, put it online,

01:27:05.635 --> 01:27:08.204
or some wazoo shit like that?

01:27:08.504 --> 01:27:10.881
You could have given this
to those agents.

01:27:10.981 --> 01:27:14.413
You could have told them everything,
but you didn't do that. Why?

01:27:14.513 --> 01:27:17.010
Because it would destroy...

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.987
'Cause it would destroy you,
and then you wouldn't be able

01:27:22.087 --> 01:27:26.656
to ride off into the night
with the damaged goods.

01:27:26.756 --> 01:27:29.492
The damaged goods, no? No?

01:27:29.892 --> 01:27:32.245
You... Oh, dear.

01:27:32.545 --> 01:27:36.418
I'm sorry to tell you this.
You really don't know what happened

01:27:36.518 --> 01:27:38.684
to your little lady friend

01:27:38.784 --> 01:27:43.906
when the raids came in
after you left her in the DRC.

01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:47.432
Wild dogs, Jim. Wild dogs.

01:27:48.564 --> 01:27:50.152
Fuck!

01:27:50.252 --> 01:27:52.513
You fucker!

01:27:55.684 --> 01:27:59.742
I really struggled with this, mate.
I had no choice.

01:27:59.842 --> 01:28:03.092
I've got a job to do.
It's just part of the job.

01:28:03.992 --> 01:28:06.521
You kill me,
the job will still get done.

01:28:07.663 --> 01:28:09.541
Then we've got nothing left
to talk about.

01:28:31.921 --> 01:28:33.715
- You okay?
- Just fucking get him!

01:31:39.358 --> 01:31:41.911
<i>Jim Terrier. I was expecting your call.</i>

01:31:42.711 --> 01:31:44.990
Have a word with your friend, Stanley.

01:31:49.827 --> 01:31:51.972
Come on, mate. Spit it out.

01:31:55.291 --> 01:31:57.526
We've been going at him
for a while here, Jim.

01:31:57.626 --> 01:32:00.596
Man hasn't said a word, not a thing.

01:32:00.796 --> 01:32:02.314
<i>That's loyalty for you.</i>

01:32:02.414 --> 01:32:05.110
For a fellow who gets paid
to kill people, he's a stand-up guy.

01:32:06.218 --> 01:32:08.030
You have a go with him, Jim.

01:32:08.829 --> 01:32:10.173
Stan.

01:32:11.807 --> 01:32:13.835
<i>Stanley.</i>

01:32:14.610 --> 01:32:17.204
Do something for me, Jim.

01:32:19.523 --> 01:32:21.492
Kill this bastard.

01:32:21.592 --> 01:32:24.796
Now I don't think that's a very nice
thing to say, Stanley.

01:32:36.707 --> 01:32:39.335
By the way, that little notebook
that you left behind in Gibraltar,

01:32:39.435 --> 01:32:42.513
don't worry about that,
I picked that up for you.

01:32:43.213 --> 01:32:45.741
<i>You know what?
That's how we found this place.</i>

01:32:45.841 --> 01:32:49.328
<i>How nice of you to have
written down the address.</i>

01:32:49.712 --> 01:32:52.890
You're way more fucked up
than I thought, Jim.

01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:55.918
I mean, there's nothing
left of you, is there?

01:32:56.018 --> 01:32:59.247
Who do you wanna talk to next?
You wanna talk to your girlfriend?

01:32:59.997 --> 01:33:01.324
<i>Here she is.</i>

01:33:02.124 --> 01:33:04.468
Come on, Annie.

01:33:06.045 --> 01:33:08.014
<i>Annie, can you hear me?</i>

01:33:08.887 --> 01:33:10.592
<i>Annie, it's me.</i>

01:33:12.118 --> 01:33:14.012
Annie...

01:33:15.529 --> 01:33:19.342
<i>Annie. Talk to me, Annie. Are you okay?</i>

01:33:19.892 --> 01:33:21.587
<i>Annie?</i>

01:33:34.323 --> 01:33:37.109
<i>You motherfucker. You motherfucker.</i>

01:33:37.809 --> 01:33:39.904
Here it is, Jim.
You come back here, I'll give you Annie.

01:33:40.204 --> 01:33:43.049
<i>You know where we are,
or did you forget that, too?</i>

01:33:44.316 --> 01:33:48.746
You're gonna meet me out
in a public place, right out in the open.

01:33:48.946 --> 01:33:51.499
- Why would I do that, Jim?
- <i>Why would you do that?</i>

01:33:51.599 --> 01:33:55.487
Take a look at your phone. I'm gonna
send you a little something, okay?

01:34:05.604 --> 01:34:09.800
<i>...advantage. Your drop cards are adjusted
to Kinshasa density altitude, right?</i>

01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:12.511
<i>Felix will give the green light
when he confirms the target is inbound.</i>

01:34:12.611 --> 01:34:16.023
<i>Felix will also designate
which of you shooters engages.</i>

01:34:16.623 --> 01:34:19.102
<i>Don't let the target escape the X.</i>

01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:23.355
<i>Okay, so here's what's gonna happen.</i>

01:34:23.455 --> 01:34:27.151
You want that video file,
you want my notebooks,

01:34:27.251 --> 01:34:29.579
<i>you're gonna meet me in a public place,
and you're gonna bring her.</i>

01:34:29.679 --> 01:34:31.164
If you don't,
I'm gonna throw it out in the street

01:34:31.264 --> 01:34:32.790
where everyone in the world can see it.

01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:36.703
<i>Do you understand? I don't give a fuck
how wazoo that sounds.</i>

01:34:38.621 --> 01:34:40.464
Where at?

01:34:53.852 --> 01:34:55.344
This is Barnes.

01:34:55.444 --> 01:34:58.916
If you're still interested
in building a tree house,

01:34:59.016 --> 01:35:00.452
I could use another hammer.

01:35:01.727 --> 01:35:02.704
Where are you?

01:35:15.032 --> 01:35:17.661
- Anything?
- <i>Nada.</i>

01:35:25.418 --> 01:35:29.322
- I hope you're here.
- <i>What did you shoot her up with?</i>

01:35:29.422 --> 01:35:31.949
Well, she's tired. It's a very hot day.

01:35:32.049 --> 01:35:34.527
<i>I have what you want.</i>

01:35:35.336 --> 01:35:38.064
- He can see us.
- Bring it here, the girl walks.

01:35:38.364 --> 01:35:42.235
<i>No, send her out now, alone,
and then I'll give you what you want.</i>

01:35:42.335 --> 01:35:45.546
We have a seat here for you, Jim.
We're not gonna do anything in public.

01:35:45.646 --> 01:35:47.823
<i>I will. Last chance. Send her out.</i>

01:35:47.923 --> 01:35:49.743
Jim...

01:35:53.029 --> 01:35:55.993
<i>I got him. Just opposite from here.
He's walking out.</i>

01:35:56.699 --> 01:35:58.777
<i>Don't lose him.</i>

01:36:04.114 --> 01:36:07.269
<i>Heading downstairs.
Should intercept him in the gallery.</i>

01:36:10.054 --> 01:36:12.049
- <i>Can you see him?</i>
- <i>Affirmative.</i>

01:36:14.625 --> 01:36:16.153
<i>Report. Where are you?</i>

01:36:20.865 --> 01:36:23.109
<i>I'm right behind him.
Heading towards the stalls.</i>

01:36:23.209 --> 01:36:25.562
<i>Copy that. I'll meet you there.</i>

01:36:31.792 --> 01:36:33.487
<i>He's heading to the corral.</i>

01:37:33.754 --> 01:37:38.110
- <i>Target's in the corral. Over.</i>
- Stay with the target. Shoot him on sight.

01:40:17.952 --> 01:40:20.380
Man down. In pursuit of target.

01:40:35.886 --> 01:40:38.948
Reiniger, Reiniger. Where are you?

01:40:39.348 --> 01:40:40.651
Shit!

01:42:10.890 --> 01:42:13.125
You can't go this way.

01:43:29.318 --> 01:43:30.786
Annie.

01:43:30.886 --> 01:43:32.666
- Jim!
- Annie.

01:43:35.349 --> 01:43:37.195
Come on. Grab my hand.

01:43:38.594 --> 01:43:39.962
Don't move!

01:43:40.662 --> 01:43:41.999
Don't move, Annie.

01:43:59.598 --> 01:44:01.289
Jim.

01:44:01.389 --> 01:44:04.929
Give me the documents, Jim.
The documents, or I kill her.

01:44:14.705 --> 01:44:16.590
Jim?

01:44:23.856 --> 01:44:24.815
- Annie.
- Jim.

01:44:24.915 --> 01:44:26.226
Use the rope.

01:44:30.446 --> 01:44:31.889
- Here.
- Jim.

01:44:31.989 --> 01:44:33.425
Hurry, Annie.

01:44:36.168 --> 01:44:38.084
Come on. Come on.

01:44:45.427 --> 01:44:46.945
Jim.

01:45:05.081 --> 01:45:06.558
Are you okay?

01:45:07.408 --> 01:45:09.615
Police! Don't move! Don't move!

01:45:11.921 --> 01:45:14.707
Let me go! No!

01:45:38.447 --> 01:45:43.411
Okay. Could you just
pat my eyes or something?

01:45:46.888 --> 01:45:48.742
Thank you.

01:45:51.101 --> 01:45:53.879
Thank you. Thanks.

01:45:55.548 --> 01:45:56.983
Where's Annie?

01:46:12.898 --> 01:46:15.110
Do we need a lawyer,
or should I start talking?

01:46:16.736 --> 01:46:20.781
You have to assure me
that nothing will happen to her.

01:46:21.365 --> 01:46:23.768
She had nothing to do with any of it.

01:46:23.868 --> 01:46:26.704
Jim, look, it's not her
you should worry about.

01:46:26.804 --> 01:46:30.149
We know she wasn't involved.
She'll be okay.

01:46:30.249 --> 01:46:32.802
You, that's another story.

01:46:33.002 --> 01:46:37.256
We understand you have some information,
material that we need.

01:46:37.715 --> 01:46:39.151
You wanna tell us what it is?

01:46:46.290 --> 01:46:50.127
I have names, dates, video files.

01:46:50.227 --> 01:46:55.074
I recorded virtually everything
from the beginning of the operation.

01:46:56.300 --> 01:46:57.653
I'll cooperate.

01:46:58.527 --> 01:47:01.114
I'll explain everything we did.

01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:05.260
You're making the right decision, Jim.

01:47:05.785 --> 01:47:10.320
<i>No doubt it's gonna help you in court,
but after what you've done,</i>

01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:12.879
<i>you're gonna serve time.</i>

01:47:14.768 --> 01:47:17.446
<i>It's gonna be tough, Jim.</i>

01:47:23.636 --> 01:47:26.042
<i>The chairman of an international
security company</i>

01:47:26.142 --> 01:47:30.518
<i>and the CEO of one of the world's
largest mining corporations</i>

01:47:30.618 --> 01:47:34.646
have been arrested on suspicion
of involvement in the assassination

01:47:34.746 --> 01:47:38.366
of Congo's Minister of Mining
eight years ago.

01:47:38.466 --> 01:47:42.863
The arrests, triggered by new evidence
from a key witness to the killing,

01:47:42.963 --> 01:47:45.416
were ordered
by the International Court of Justice

01:47:45.516 --> 01:47:48.769
<i>after a lengthy Interpol investigation.</i>

01:47:48.869 --> 01:47:50.913
<i>No official statement
has been released yet,</i>

01:47:51.013 --> 01:47:53.841
<i>but a source close
to the investigation said</i>

01:47:53.941 --> 01:47:59.822
the case raises new questions about
the covert methods used by multinationals

01:47:59.922 --> 01:48:04.285
seeking to control natural resources
in the developing world

01:48:04.385 --> 01:48:08.615
regardless of the humanitarian
consequences.
