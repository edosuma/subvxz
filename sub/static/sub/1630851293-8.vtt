>> John: HI THERE!

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
STILL COMING TO YOU FROM THIS

00:33.000 --> 00:33.000
BLANK VOID.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
WHICH I ACTUALLY SHARE WITH THE

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
PIXAR LAMP.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
IT SAYS IF I TRY TO LEAVE, IT'LL

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
CRUSH ME LIKE THE LETTER "I",

00:40.000 --> 00:40.000
AND I CAN'T TELL HOW SCARED

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
AND/OR HORNY I SHOULD BE.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
IT'S BEEN ANOTHER BUSY WEEK.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
IN THE U.S., COVID VACCINATIONS

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
ARE RACING AGAINST NEW VARIANTS

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
OF THE VIRUS.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
AND IN THE U.K., PRINCE PHILIP

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
DIED, WHICH IS A TRAGEDY IF YOU

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
DON'T KNOW A SINGLE THING ABOUT

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
HIM.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000

ABOUT HIM, YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW

THIS.

>> TAKE IT BACK TO THE BEGINNING

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
FOR US, ALASTAIR, AND TELL US

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
HOW THE YOUNG PRINCE PHILIP OF

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
GREECE AND DENMARK MET THE

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000

01:10.000 --> 01:10.000
PRINCE PHILIP AND

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
QUEEN ELIZABETH ARE COUSINS WHO

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
LATER GOT MARRIED -- ALSO KNOWN

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
AS A "GIULIANI MEET-CUTE."

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
MEANWHILE, THE MATT GAETZ SAGA

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
CONTINUES TO UNFOLD THIS WEEK,

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
AND NOT IN ANY WAYS THAT LOOK

01:22.000 --> 01:22.000
GOOD FOR HIM.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
>> THE NEW REPORT OVERNIGHT

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
ALLEGES GAETZ SENT CLOSE

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
ASSOCIATE AND ACCUSED

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
SEX TRAFFICKER JOEL GREENBERG

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
$900 IN TWO LATE-NIGHT VENMO

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
TRANSACTIONS IN 2018.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
ACCORDING TO THE DAILY BEAST,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
GREENBERG USED THE SAME APP TO

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
SEND THREE YOUNG WOMEN,

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
INCLUDING ONE WHO HAD RECENTLY

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
TURNED 18, VARYING SUMS OF MONEY

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
THAT AMOUNTED TO $900.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
GREENBERG MADE THE PAYMENTS TO

01:42.000 --> 01:42.000
THE THREE YOUNG WOMEN WITH THE

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
DESCRIPTIONS "TUITION,"

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
"SCHOOL," AND "SCHOOL."

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
>> John: YOU FUCKING IDIOTS!

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE TO SAY

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
THIS, BUT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
SUSPICIOUS POTENTIALLY CRIMINAL

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
TRANSACTIONS,

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
VENMO IS NOT THE APP TO USE.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
VENMO IS FOR ONE THING AND ONE

02:02.000 --> 02:02.000
THING ONLY: PASSING JUDGMENT ON

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
FRIENDS' SPENDING HABITS WHILE

02:03.000 --> 02:03.000
OBSESSING OVER WILD FINANCIAL

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
MYSTERIES.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
WAIT, BRIAN PAID HIS GIRLFRIEND

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
FOR PIZZA?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
WHY CAN'T KAITLIN JUST LET HIM

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
SLIDE ON THIS?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
THEY LIVE TOGETHER, AND IT'S

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
PIZZA.

02:10.000 --> 02:10.000
WAIT, KAITLIN'S PAYING BRIAN

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
NOW?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
FOR CAKE?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
BRIAN LIKED IT?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
THE FUCK IS GOING ON IN

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
THIS RELATIONSHIP?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
AND LOOK, I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

02:18.000 --> 02:18.000
MATT GAETZ HAS DENIED ALL

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
ACCUSATIONS.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
AND I'M SURE THERE WILL BE MORE

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
TO SAY ABOUT ALL THIS WHEN HE

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
GOES TO PRISON.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
BUT FOR NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
IMMIGRATION.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COVERAGE

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
LATELY ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
THE BORDER, WHICH IS TROUBLING

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
AND COMPLICATED, BUT I'D

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
ACTUALLY LIKE TO TALK ABOUT

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
SOMETHING A LOT LESS COMPLICATED

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
THAT'S ALSO GETTING A LOT LESS

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
COVERAGE, AND THAT IS THE U.S.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
REFUGEE ADMISSIONS PROGRAM.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
IT'S FOR PEOPLE CURRENTLY ABROAD

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
FLEEING PERSECUTION OR VIOLENCE

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
WHO'VE APPLIED FOR RESETTLEMENT.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
AND THE U.S. USED TO BE A WORLD

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
LEADER IN HOW MANY REFUGEES WE

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
ACCEPTED, BUT THIS FUCKING GUY

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
NOT ONLY SLASHED THE ADMISSIONS

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
CAP DOWN TO A HISTORIC ANNUAL

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
LOW OF 15,000, HE ALSO ADDED

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
DISCRIMINATORY ELIGIBILITY

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
CATEGORIES THAT HAVE BLOCKED

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
MANY MUSLIM AND AFRICAN REFUGEES

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
FROM COMING TO THE U.S.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
AND TO HIS CREDIT, BIDEN RAN ON

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
A PLATFORM THAT INCLUDED

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
REVERSING TRUMP'S POLICIES.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
AND SINCE TAKING OFFICE, HE'S

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
BEEN ABOUT AS ELOQUENT AS BIDEN

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
CAN BE ABOUT THE MORAL

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
IMPERATIVE OF DOING SO.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
>> COME WITH ME INTO

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
SIERRA LEONE.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
COME WITH ME INTO PARTS OF

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
LEBANON.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
COME WITH ME AROUND THE WORLD

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
AND SEE PEOPLE PILED UP IN

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
CAMPS, KIDS DYING, NO WAY OUT,

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
REFUGEES FLEEING FROM

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
PERSECUTION.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
WE, THE UNITED STATES, USED TO

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
DO OUR PART.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
WE WERE PART OF THAT.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
WE'RE -- AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S,

03:38.000 --> 03:38.000
YOU KNOW -- SEND ME YOUR

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
HUDDLED MASSES.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
COME ON!

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
>> John: RIGHT, AND UNDERNEATH

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
THAT PATRIOTIC WORD SALAD IS A

03:48.000 --> 03:48.000
PRETTY GOOD POINT.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
EVEN THOUGH HE'S MAKING IT WHILE

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
MANAGING TO SOUND LIKE A GUY IN

03:50.000 --> 03:50.000
A STATUE OF LIBERTY COSTUME IN

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
TIMES SQUARE.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
"SEND ME YOUR HUDDLED MASSES.

03:53.000 --> 03:53.000
COME ON.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I'M BREATHING IN GREEN LEAD

03:54.000 --> 03:54.000
PAINT HERE, SO DO YOU WANT

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
A PICTURE WITH ME AND

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
BUZZ LIGHTYEAR OR NOT?"

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
IN EARLY FEBRUARY, BIDEN

03:58.000 --> 03:58.000
ANNOUNCED THAT HE'D RAISE THE

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
CEILING ON ADMISSIONS TO OVER

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
62,000, ELIMINATE TRUMP'S

04:02.000 --> 04:02.000
RESTRICTIONS, AND RAISE THE CAP

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
EVEN HIGHER NEXT YEAR.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
WHICH SOUNDS GREAT.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT WAS TWO

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
MONTHS AGO, AND HE STILL HASN'T

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
SIGNED THE PRESIDENTIAL

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
DETERMINATION THAT WOULD REVISE

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
TRUMP'S RULES.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
AND IT HAS BEEN HARD TO GET A

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
STRAIGHT ANSWER FROM THIS

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
ADMINISTRATION ABOUT WHY.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THAT

04:22.000 --> 04:22.000
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
DONE IMMEDIATELY.

04:23.000 --> 04:23.000
WHY DIDN'T HE DO IT TODAY?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
>> I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
AGAIN SOON IN THE COMING DAYS

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
AND WEEKS ON MORE STEPS AND

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
ACTIONS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
INTERESTED IN TAKING.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
SO I'M JUST NOT GONNA GET AHEAD

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
OF THAT RIGHT NOW.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
>> WHY HASN'T THE PRESIDENT

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
SIGNED THE PAPERWORK TO LIFT

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
THE, THE -- RAISE THE REFUGEE

04:36.000 --> 04:36.000
CAP?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
>> WELL, I WOULD REFER YOU TO

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
THE STATE DEPARTMENT.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
>> LAST MONTH, THE PRESIDENT DID

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
ANNOUNCE THAT HE INTENDED TO

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
RAISE THE REFUGEE CAP.

04:45.000 --> 04:45.000
THAT HASN'T SEEMED TO HAPPEN YET.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
WHY HAVEN'T THOSE FLIGHTS

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
CONTINUED?

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
>> HE REMAINS COMMITTED, BUT I

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
DON'T HAVE AN UPDATE ON THE

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
TIMING OF THE FLIGHTS.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
>> DOES IT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
WITH THE FACT THAT RESOURCES ARE

04:53.000 --> 04:53.000
GOING TOWARDS THE BORDER AT THIS

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
TIME?

04:54.000 --> 04:54.000
OR --

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
>> NO, NO, IT'S NOT RELATED TO

04:56.000 --> 04:56.000
THAT.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
NO.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
>> John: THEN WHAT IS IT RELATED

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
TO?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
ALTHOUGH PROPS TO JEN PSAKI,

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
ONLY A FEW MONTHS INTO THE JOB

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
AND SHE'S ALREADY WAVING AWAY

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
CONCERNS ABOUT STRANDED REFUGEES

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
WITH THE EASE OF

05:10.000 --> 05:10.000
A SPIRIT AIRLINES GATE

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
AGENT LETTING YOU KNOW YOUR

05:11.000 --> 05:11.000
FLIGHT'S DELAYED.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
"REST ASSURED, WE'RE COMMITTED

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
TO GETTING YOU TO ORLANDO

05:13.000 --> 05:13.000
EVENTUALLY.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
WE JUST CAN'T TELL YOU WHERE

05:14.000 --> 05:14.000
YOUR PLANE IS, WHY IT'S TAKING

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
SO LONG, OR WHAT YEAR YOU MIGHT

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
ARRIVE."

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
AND THE THING IS, THERE ARE

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
NEARLY 115,000 REFUGEES IN

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
VARIOUS STAGES OF THE

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
RESETTLEMENT PROCESS RIGHT NOW,

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
WITH MORE THAN 35,000 ALREADY

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
APPROVED FOR RESETTLEMENT HERE.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
BUT UNTIL BIDEN SIGNS THAT

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
DETERMINATION, THEY'RE STILL

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
BEHOLDEN TO TRUMP'S LOW

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
ADMISSIONS CEILING AND BULLSHIT

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
RACIST RULES.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
AND MUCH AMONG, MORE THAN 700

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
REFUGEES HAD THEIR FLIGHTS

05:47.000 --> 05:47.000
CANCELED. AND REMEMBER, THESE ARE

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
SURRENDERED THEIR BELONGINGS OR

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
HOMES IN ANTICIPATION OF LEAVING

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
THE COUNTRY OR WHO ARE WAITING

05:51.000 --> 05:51.000
IN CAMPS.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
ALSO, ANY DELAY CAN MEAN THEIR

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
REQUIRED HEALTH OR SECURITY

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
CHECKS EXPIRE, AND THEY HAVE TO

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
START THE WHOLE PROCESS ALL OVER

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
AGAIN.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
ONE CONGOLESE WOMAN WAS

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
SCHEDULED TO FLY HERE IN EARLY

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
MARCH BUT HAD HER TICKET

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
CANCELED, AND BECAUSE SHE'S

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
PREGNANT AND NOW IN HER THIRD

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
TRIMESTER, SHE CAN NO LONGER

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
TRAVEL AT ALL.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
AND BY THE WAY, WHEN HER BABY IS

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
BORN, THAT CHILD WILL HAVE TO

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
UNDERGO A SEPARATE SCREENING

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
PROCESS THAT COULD TAKE MONTHS.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
WHICH IS PRETTY WEIRD BECAUSE

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
I'M RELATIVELY SURE YOU CAN'T

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
HAVE FOREIGN ALLEGIANCES BEFORE

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
YOU HAVE OBJECT FUCKING

06:25.000 --> 06:25.000
PERMANENCE.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

06:26.000 --> 06:26.000
NOW STUCK IN THIS POINTLESS

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
LIMBO.

06:27.000 --> 06:27.000
IT'S AN INFURIATING SITUATION,

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
PERHAPS BEST SUMMED BY THIS

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
WOMAN, WHO CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
HER FRIEND -- A REFUGEE

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
CURRENTLY STUCK IN A CAMP IN

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
MALAWI, WHO'S BEEN APPROVED FOR

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
RESETTLEMENT -- CAN'T GET ON A

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
PLANE.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
>> THIS PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
WHEN HE CAME, HE SAID THAT HE

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
WOULD JUST ADD MORE REFUGEES TO

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
COME TO USA.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
AND I HEAR IN THE NEWS THAT

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
THERE IS A PAPER.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS A PAPER OR

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
SOMETHING THAT HE'S SUPPOSED TO

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
SIGN.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
PLEASE, PLEASE, IF HE HEAR MY

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
VOICE, PLEASE HELP OUR FRIENDS

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
WHO ARE STRUGGLING IN THE

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
REFUGEE CAMP.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
>> John: LOOK, AT LEAST SOME

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
OF THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
BIDEN -- MAYBE RELUCTANTLY --

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
DID SO ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
REFUGEES WOULD NOT HAVE TO GO ON

07:10.000 --> 07:10.000
CAMERA TO BEG FOR THEIR

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
ALREADY-APPROVED LOVED ONES TO

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
BE ALLOWED TO COME HERE, BECAUSE

07:14.000 --> 07:14.000
THAT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
GOOD GUYS ARE SUPPOSED TO

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
CHANGE, RIGHT NEXT TO NOT HIRING

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
THEIR OWN KIDS OR NOT LETTING

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
MIKE LINDELL SWAP OUT THE

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
PILLOWS IN THE LINCOLN BEDROOM.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
AND FOR BIDEN, THIS IS ACTUALLY

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
REALLY SIMPLE.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
HE DOESN'T NEED TO NEGOTIATE

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
WITH REPUBLICANS ON THIS OR

07:27.000 --> 07:27.000
RECKON WITH JOE MANCHIN'S BONER

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
FOR THE FILIBUSTER.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
HE JUST NEEDS TO SIGN A PIECE OF

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
PAPER.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
AND FOR A GUY WHO CLEARLY WANTED

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
TO BE THE PERSON WHO "RESTORED

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
THE SOUL" OF AMERICA, IT'S PAST

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
TIME FOR HIM TO LOOK DEEP INTO

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
HIS OWN, PICK UP A FUCKING PEN,

07:43.000 --> 07:43.000
AND DO THE RIGHT THING.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
AND NOW THIS.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
>> Announcer: AND NOW, A

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
FAREWELL TRIBUTE TO THE GREATEST

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
QUESTIONS EVER ASKED ON

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
YAHOO! ANSWERS.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
>> WHY DO MY BALLS SMELL LIKE

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
HAM?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
WHAT'S WRONG ABOUT BEING

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO POKEMON?

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
IS IT TRUE THAT SWEAT IN PEE ARE

08:11.000 --> 08:11.000
LIKE COUSINS?

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
WHAT IS THAT ONE MOVIE WHERE

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
LINDSAY LOHAN AND JAMIE LEE

08:19.000 --> 08:19.000
CURTIS SWITCH BODIES?

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
NOT "FREAKY FRIDAY?"

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
STD FROM DOUG?

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
IS IT POSSIBLE?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
OKAY, WEIRD QUESTION, I SAW A

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
FROG CARRYING ANOTHER FROG ON

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
ITS BACK.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
DOES OF ART CONTAIN DNA?

08:38.000 --> 08:46.000
HOW IS BABBY FORMED?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
>> John: MOVING ON.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
NURSING HOMES, THE ABSOLUTE LAST

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
THING YOU WANT ANDREW CUOMO TO

08:50.000 --> 08:50.000
BE HANDLING, TIED COMFORTABLY

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
WITH LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
NURSING HOMES, AND LONG-TERM

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
CARE IN GENERAL, ARE SOMETHING

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
WE TEND TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
BUT THE TRUTH IS, WHETHER DUE TO

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
OLD AGE OR DISABILITY, MANY OF

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
US DO OR WILL REQUIRE HELP WITH

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
DAILY LIVING.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS 65 AND

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
OLDER IS PROJECTED TO NEARLY

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
DOUBLE OVER THE NEXT 40 YEARS,

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
AND ONE STUDY ESTIMATED OVER

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
TWO-THIRDS OF AMERICANS WHO

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
REACH 65 WILL NEED LONG-TERM

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
CARE AT SOME POINT IN THEIR

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
LIVES.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS, FOR THE

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
RICH, THERE ARE PLENTY OF

09:23.000 --> 09:23.000
OPTIONS.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
THERE ARE MULTIPLE UPSCALE

09:24.000 --> 09:24.000
RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES WHERE

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
RESIDENTS CAN TRANSITION, IF

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
NEEDED, INTO FULL-TIME NURSING

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
CARE, LIKE THIS ONE, TOURED IN

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
EXQUISITE FASHION BY 2 CHAINZ:

09:28.000 --> 09:28.000
>> ALL RIGHT.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
SO THE NAME OF THIS EPISODE IS

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
CALLED "THE MOST EXPENSIVE

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
RETIREMENT," RIGHT?

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
AND SO THIS IS THE MOST

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
UPSCALE, LUXURIOUS RETIREMENT

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
HOME THAT I'VE EVER SEEN AND

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
EVER HEARD ABOUT.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
>> THE BUILDING ITSELF COST

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
$100 MILLION TO BUILD.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
>> DAMN.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
>> THE -- THE MARBLE, IT'S FROM

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
ITALY.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
IT'S CUSTOM CARPET.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
>> I SEE A LOT OF ART.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
I SEE THE VERSACE PLATES.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
>> John: OKAY.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
EXTRAVAGANCE OF THAT PLACE

09:53.000 --> 09:53.000
ASIDE, LET'S ALL JUST AGREE:

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
THAT $195 PLATE SUCKS SHIT.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
AND I'M NOT NORMALLY A PLATE

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
GUY -- YOUR BOY'S A SAUCER FREAK

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
FROM WAY BACK.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
I'M A BOWL BITCH.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
PLATES AREN'T REALLY MY THING.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
BUT EVEN I CAN TELL THAT PLATE

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
IS A 2.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
THAT'S A 2 IN OHIO.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
IF YOU'RE GONNA SPEND THAT KIND

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
OF MONEY ON A PLATE, IT BETTER

10:09.000 --> 10:09.000
BE REALLY BIG, REALLY FUN, OR

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
REALLY, REALLY HOT.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
THAT PLATE --

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
LOOK AT ME.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
PUT YOUR PHONE DOWN AND LOOK AT

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
ME WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU.

10:20.000 --> 10:20.000
THAT PLATE FUCKS.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
BUT THE FACT IS, MOST OF US

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
AREN'T ENDING UP IN THAT PLACE.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
IN FACT, THE VAST MAJORITY OF

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
PEOPLE RECEIVE LONG-TERM CARE AT

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
HOME, AND AROUND 80% OF THAT

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
CARE IS PROVIDED BY UNPAID

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
CAREGIVERS, OFTEN FAMILY MEMBERS

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
WHO WANT TO KEEP THEIR LOVED

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
ONES OUT OF INSTITUTIONAL CARE,

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
LIKE THIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
>> CHERYL AND KRISTIN ARE AMONG

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
THE 42 MILLION AMERICANS CARING

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
FOR LOVED ONES AT HOME, AND THE

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
TASKS THEY PERFORM HAVE BECOME

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
INCREASINGLY COMPLEX.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
>> WHEN WE HAVE TO FLUSH HIS

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
PICC LINE OR CLEAN HIS PEG TUBE

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
OR TAKE HIS BLOOD GLUCOSE OR HIS

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
BLOOD PRESSURE, YOU KNOW, NONE

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
OF US WENT TO SCHOOL FOR THAT.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT EDUCATED THAT

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
WAY.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
>> I DON'T FEEL LIKE I HAD

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
ENOUGH TRAINING AT ALL FOR THIS.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
WE'VE KIND OF LEARNED BY TRIAL

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
AND ERROR.

10:57.000 --> 11:03.000
>> John: THAT SEEMS REALLY HARD.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
AND THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS

11:04.000 --> 11:04.000
YOU EXPECT TO DO BY TRIAL AND

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
ERROR -- SOLVING A PUZZLE,

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
LEARNING TO PRONOUNCE THE NAME

11:06.000 --> 11:06.000
OF TAMBOURINE SATURDAY, OR

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
CHOOSING A HAIRCUT -- FOR THE

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
RECORD, ERROR, ERROR, ERROR, AND

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
ERROR -- BUT PROVIDING ESSENTIAL

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
MEDICAL CARE SHOULD NOT BE ONE

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
OF THOSE THINGS.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
TAKING CARE OF SOMEONE AT HOME

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
CAN BE AN INCREDIBLY

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
COMPLICATED, FULL-TIME JOB

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
THAT IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNPAID.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
IN FACT, IN TERMS OF LOST WAGES,

11:28.000 --> 11:28.000
THE LABOR OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
TOTALS ABOUT $67 BILLION

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
ANNUALLY.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
THAT'S A WORKFORCE THAT, IF IT

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
WERE PAID, WOULD RIVAL THE

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
ENTIRE GDP OF BULGARIA.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
BUT FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
TO EAT OFF UNFUCKABLE PLATES OR

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
WHOSE LOVED ONES ARE UNABLE TO

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
HELP THEM AT HOME, MANY WIND UP

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
IN LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES.

11:46.000 --> 11:46.000
THERE ARE TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
THEM IN THE U.S., AND AS WE'VE

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
SEEN DURING THE COVID CRISIS,

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
THEY CAN BE FAR FROM IDEAL.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
RESIDENTS AND STAFF IN THEM MAKE

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
UP LESS THAN 1% OF THE

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
POPULATION, BUT CURRENTLY

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
ACCOUNT FOR A THIRD OF COVID

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
DEATHS.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
THE PANDEMIC PUSHED AN ALREADY

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
HEAVILY STRAINED SYSTEM TO THE

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
ABSOLUTE BRINK, WITH CONDITIONS

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
GETTING SO BAD THERE WERE

12:07.000 --> 12:07.000
NEAR-CONSTANT LOCAL NEWS STORIES

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
LIKE THIS:

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
>> ONE RESIDENT HERE SAYS HER

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
CALLS FOR HELP OR IGNORED

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
BECAUSE THERE WASN'T ENOUGH

12:16.000 --> 12:16.000
STAFF TO RESPOND.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
>> I'M SCREAMING, "GET ME OUT OF

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
HERE, GET ME OUT OF HERE, GET ME

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
OUT OF THIS THI --"

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I WAS SCREAMING AT THEM.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
I WAS IN TERRIBLE PAIN, AND THEY

12:22.000 --> 12:22.000
DIDN'T COME FOR ME.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
>> PENNY SHAW WAS IN PAIN AS SHE

12:23.000 --> 12:23.000
LAY HELPLESS IN HER BED AT

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
BRAINTREE MANOR NURSING HOME IN

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
THE MIDST OF THE COVID-19

12:27.000 --> 12:27.000
PANDEMIC.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
SHE BECAME SO DESPERATE SHE EVEN

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
CALLED BRAINTREE POLICE FOR

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
HELP.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
>> I CAN'T LAY IN BED FOR HOURS

12:34.000 --> 12:34.000
AND HOURS, YOU KNOW, IN PAIN

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
LIKE THAT.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
>> John: I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
WE CONTACTED THAT FACILITY, IT

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
INSISTED THAT THE SAFETY OF ITS

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
RESIDENTS IS OF UTMOST

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
IMPORTANCE, BUT THAT IS PRETTY

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
FUCKING HARD TO BELIEVE WHEN

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
THEY ARE CALLING THE POLICE FOR

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
HEALTH.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
THEIR ONLY TWO INSTANCES WHERE

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
THAT IS TO BE EXPECTED, AND THAT

13:04.000 --> 13:04.000
IS

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
IF YOU'RE GIVING BIRTH OR

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
DIGESTING A CRUNCH WRAP SUPREME.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
BUT IT'S A LOT MORE UPSETTING

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
AND THE TRUTH IS, COVID JUST

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
EXPOSED WHAT WE'VE BASICALLY

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
KNOWN FOR YEARS -- THAT THE WAY

13:11.000 --> 13:11.000
THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED ARE

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
TREATED IN FAR TOO MANY OF THESE

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
FACILITIES IS WITH, AT BEST,

13:14.000 --> 13:14.000
INDIFFERENCE, AND AT WORST,

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
ABUSE AND NEGLECT.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

13:17.000 --> 13:17.000
LONG-TERM CARE -- HOW THE

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
INDUSTRY IS STRUCTURED, HOW THAT

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
STRUCTURE CREATES BAD

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
INCENTIVES, AND WHAT WE CAN DO

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
GOG FORWARD.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
AND WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
TWO MAIN TYPES OF LONG-TERM

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
CARE FACILITIES: NURSING HOMES,

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
AND ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
NURSING HOMES ARE MEDICAL

13:34.000 --> 13:34.000
FACILITIES OVERSEEN BY TRAINED

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
NURSES AND LARGELY STAFFED BY

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
LOW-PAID NURSING ASSISTANTS.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
AND THERE HAVE LONG BEEN ISSUES

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
WITH NURSING HOME CARE -- A GAO

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
REPORT COVERING A FIVE-YEAR

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
PERIOD BEFORE THE PANDEMIC FOUND

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
THAT 82% OF HOMES HAD BEEN CITED

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
FOR INFECTION PREVENTION AND

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
CONTROL DEFICIENCIES, AND ABOUT

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
HALF HAD PERSISTENT PROBLEMS

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
THAT HAD BEEN CITED ACROSS

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
MULTIPLE YEARS.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
AND A BIG REASON FOR THAT MAY BE

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
BECAUSE UNDERSTAFFING IS A BIG

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
PROBLEM, WITH EMPLOYEES OFTEN

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
TASKED WITH TAKING CARE OF WAY

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
TOO MANY RESIDENTS, AS THESE

14:05.000 --> 14:05.000
NURSING ASSISTANTS POINTED OUT

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
JUST LAST YEAR.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
>> THEY'RE NOT BEING SHOWERED.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
>> PEOPLE FALLING OUT OF BED.

14:10.000 --> 14:10.000
>> THE MEN AREN'T BEING SHAVED.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
>> PEOPLE FALLEN TO WHERE THEY

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
FELL OUT OF THEIR WHEELCHAIRS.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
>> WHAT IF THEY NEED CHANGED?

14:16.000 --> 14:16.000
>> THEY MIGHT GET IT ONE TIME.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
>> A DAY?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
>> A DAY.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
WE HAVE 22 RESIDENTS APIECE.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
MOST DAYS, THAT'S FOR ONE PERSON

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
TO WASH, DRESS, GET UP, TWO

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
MEALS, AND THEY'RE BEING

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
NEGLECTED BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
TO EVERYBODY.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
I TOLD THE ADMINISTRATOR, I'M

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
EMBARRASSED OF MY WORK PROCESS

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
BECAUSE I CAN'T DO WHAT I WAS

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
TRAINED TO DO ON HOW TO TAKE

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
CARE OF THESE RESIDENTS.

14:46.000 --> 14:46.000
>> John: THAT IS OBVIOUSLY

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
UNACCEPTABLE.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW BAD

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
THINGS NEED TO GET FOR YOU TO

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
TELL YOUR BOSS YOU'RE

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
EMBARRASSED BY YOUR WORK?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
I'M NOT EVEN EMBARRASSED BY MY

14:54.000 --> 14:54.000
WORK, AND JUST THREE MINUTES

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
AGO, I JOKED ABOUT FUCKING A

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
PLATE.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
ALSO, THAT WASN'T REALLY A JOKE.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
CALL ME, WOLF PLATE.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
AND NURSING ASSISTANTS AREN'T

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
JUST OVERWORKED -- THEY'RE

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
REALLY UNDERPAID.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
THE MEDIAN NATIONAL SALARY FOR

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
THAT JOB IS BARELY $30,000 A

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
YEAR.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
AND ONE REASON IS THAT NEARLY

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
70% OF NURSING HOMES ARE NOW

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
FOR-PROFIT INSTITUTIONS.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
AND THERE IS A LOT OF PROFIT FOR

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
THEM TO MAKE, BECAUSE THEY DON'T

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
PAY STAFF MUCH, BUT THEY CHARGE

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
YOU A LOT.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
THE AVERAGE PER-PERSON COST FOR

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
A PRIVATE ROOM IS $100,000 PER

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
YEAR.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "YEAH,

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
THAT IS EXPENSIVE, BUT DOESN'T

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
THE MEDICARE PROGRAM I HAVE PAID

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
INTO ALL MY LIFE COVER THAT?"

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
WELL, NO, IT DOESN'T.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
MEDICARE ONLY FULLY COVERS THE

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
FIRST 20 DAYS OF NURSING HOME

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
CARE AFTER AN ELIGIBLE HOSPITAL

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
VISIT, THEN PARTIALLY PAYS FOR

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
UP TO 100 DAYS.

15:42.000 --> 15:48.000
BUT AFTER THAT, YOU ARE ON THE

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
HOOK FOR ALL COSTS.

15:49.000 --> 15:49.000
THE ONLY OTHER WAY TO ACCESS

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
TAXPAYER HELP TO LIVE IN A

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
NURSING HOME IS TO ALMOST

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
COMPLETELY IMPOVERISH YOURSELF,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
TO BASICALLY SPEND YOUR WAY DOWN

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
TO THE POINT YOU QUALIFY FOR

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
MEDICAID, THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
FOR THE POOR, WHICH, CRUCIALLY,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
REIMBURSES NURSING HOMES AT LESS

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
THAN HALF THE AVERAGE DAILY RATE

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
PAID BY MEDICARE.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
AND WHILE YOU WOULD LIKE TO

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
THINK THAT NURSING HOMES WOULD

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
TREAT ALL PATIENTS THE SAME,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
WHETHER THEY'RE ON MEDICARE OR

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
MEDICAID, THE TRUTH IS, YOU

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
MIGHT GET TWO VERY DIFFERENT

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
EXPERIENCES.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE ON MEDICARE,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
YOU COULD WIND UP GETTING TOO

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
MUCH ATTENTION.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
JUST LISTEN TO AN ASSISTANT

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
MANAGER AT ONE NURSING HOME

16:22.000 --> 16:22.000
CHAIN DESCRIBE HOW MEDICARE

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
PATIENTS THERE WERE TREATED.

16:25.000 --> 16:25.000
>> WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
THERAPY THAT YOU WERE BEING TOLD

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
TO ADMINISTER DO YOU THINK WAS

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
NOT NECESSARY?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
>> I WOULD SAY PROBABLY, AS TIME

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
WENT ON, ABOUT 40%.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
>> 40% OF THE WORK THAT YOU WERE

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
DOING --

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
>> WAS NOT REASONABLE AND NOT

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
NECESSARY UNDER MEDICARE

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
GUIDELINES.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
AT ANOTHER FACILITY, THE ENTIRE

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
REHAB STAFF SIGNED A LETTER TO

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
THEIR BOSS.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
IT READS, "WE HAVE BEEN

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
ENCOURAGED TO MAXIMIZE

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
REIMBURSEMENT EVEN WHEN

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
CLINICALLY INAPPROPRIATE."

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
>> John: THAT IS ABSURD.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
THE DOJ ACTUALLY FILED A LAWSUIT

16:54.000 --> 16:54.000
CLAIMING THAT THE CHAIN THAT

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
WOMAN WORKED FOR, LIFE CARE

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
CENTERS OF AMERICA -- WHICH RUNS

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
OVER 200 NURSING HOMES -- WAS

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
SUBJECTING ITS PATIENTS TO

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
THERAPY EVEN AS THEY WERE ON

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
THEIR DEATHBEDS.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
IT ALLEGED ONE 92-YEAR-OLD WHO

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
WAS DYING OF METASTATIC CANCER

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
WAS RECORDED AS HAVING HAD

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
48 MINUTES OF PHYSICAL THERAPY,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
47 MINUTES OF OCCUPATIONAL

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
THERAPY, AND 30 MINUTES OF

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
SPEECH THERAPY, JUST TWO DAYS

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
BEFORE HIS DEATH, ON A DAY HE

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
WAS SPITTING UP BLOOD.

17:18.000 --> 17:18.000
WHICH IS ABSURD.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
RESIDENTS SHOULD BE GETTING

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
PROPER NURSING CARE.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
NOT SHIT-TONS OF EXPENSIVE

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
THERAPEUTIC TREATMENTS THAT ARE

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
CLINICALLY INAPPROPRIATE.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
WHICH, BY THE WAY, I'M PRETTY

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
SURE WAS THE ORIGINAL SLOGAN OF

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
GOOP.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
NOW, LIFE CARE DENIED

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
WRONGDOING, BUT AGREED TO PAY

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
$145 MILLION TO RESOLVE THAT

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
LAWSUIT.

17:39.000 --> 17:39.000
AND THEY'RE HARDLY ALONE HERE.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
OVER THE PAST DECADE, MULTIPLE

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
OTHER LARGE NURSING HOME CHAINS

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
FRAUDULENT MEDICARE BILLING

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
PRACTICES AND DENIED WRONGDOING

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
WHILE PAYING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
TO SETTLE THEIR CASES.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU DO WHEN

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
YOU ARE TOTALLY INNOCENT.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
SO TO RECAP HERE: IF MEDICARE IS

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
PAYING, THE RISK IS, YOU COULD

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
BILLED FOR UNNECESSARY

17:58.000 --> 17:58.000
TREATMENTS.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
BUT IF MEDICAID IS PAYING --

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
WHICH, REMEMBER, REIMBURSES

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
NURSING HOMES AT LESS THAN HALF

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
THE AVERAGE DAILY RATE -- THINGS

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
COULD GET MUCH WORSE.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
BECAUSE IF FACILITIES WANT TO

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
OPEN UP A BED TO A MORE

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
LUCRATIVE PATIENT, THEY CAN TAKE

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
DRASTIC ACTION.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
>> RONALD, WHO WAS 51 AND

18:14.000 --> 18:14.000
HOMELESS, GOT REHAB AT THE

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
NURSING HOME WHERE HE LIVED FOR

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
MORE THAN A YEAR.

18:17.000 --> 18:17.000
THEN ONE NIGHT, AROUND

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
10:00 P.M., HE SAYS AN

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
ADMINISTRATOR CAME INTO HIS

18:22.000 --> 18:22.000
ROOM.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
>> BIG SMILE ON THEIR FACE,

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
SAYING, "WE'RE KICKING YOU OUT."

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
YEAH.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
AND THEY JUST BUNDLED ME INTO A

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
VAN AND JUST DROPPED ME OFF HERE

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
ON THE SIDEWALK.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
>> THE AVALON VILLA CARE CENTER,

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
THROUGH ITS LAWYERS, TOLD NBC

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
NEWS IT STRONGLY DISPUTES THAT

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
IT HAS INAPPROPRIATELY

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
DISCHARGED ANY PATIENTS.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
THE HOMELESS SHELTER WHERE

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
RONALD IS LIVING NOW SAYS IT'S

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
SEEN CASES LIKE THIS BEFORE.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
EXPERTS EVEN HAVE A TERM FOR IT:

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
RESIDENT DUMPING.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
>> John: OH, COME ON, THAT'S

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
JUST FUCKING EVIL.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
"RESIDENT DUMPING" IS A

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
PRACTICE.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
I DON'T EVEN LIKE IT WHEN

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
RESIDENTS ARE DUMPED ON

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
"GREY'S ANATOMY."

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
AT THE ALTAR, BURKE?

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
YOU DUMPED THAT RESIDENT AT THE

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
FUCKING ALTAR?

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO

19:10.000 --> 19:10.000
CRISTINA?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
YOU FUCKING MONSTER!

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
AND YOU'D HOPE REGULATORS WOULD

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
PUNISH NURSING HOMES FOR DOING

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
THINGS LIKE THAT.

19:14.000 --> 19:14.000
BUT THE OVERSIGHT HERE HAS SOME

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
MASSIVE GAPS.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
FOR INSTANCE, THE FEDERAL

19:16.000 --> 19:16.000
GOVERNMENT KEEPS A LIST OF

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
SO-CALLED "SPECIAL FOCUS

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
FACILITIES" -- HOMES THAT HAVE A

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
PATTERN OF SERIOUS PROBLEMS OVER

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
THEREFORE RECEIVE EXTRA

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
INSPECTIONS.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
THERE ARE 88 NURSING HOMES ON

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
THAT LIST -- BUT INTERESTINGLY,

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
NOT BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
88 HOMES THAT DESERVE TO BE, BUT

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
BECAUSE, DUE TO LIMITED

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
RESOURCES, THE GOVERNMENT HAS

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
CAPPED THE LIST AT THAT EXACT

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
NUMBER, DESPITE THE FACT THEY

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE AN ADDITIONAL

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
400 FACILITIES QUALIFY FOR THE

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
PROGRAM.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
AND LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING EVERY

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
LIST SHOULD GO ON FOREVER.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
IF A LIST OF CUTEST OTTERS WAS

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
CAPPED AT 88, THAT'D BE A

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
PERFECTLY FINE LIST.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
BUT IF THERE WERE 400 OTHER CUTE

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
OTTERS THAT WERE ALSO ABUSING

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
THE ELDERLY, I'D REALLY LIKE TO

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
KNOW WHO ALL OF THEM ARE.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WELL,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
IF I NEED TO MOVE A LOVED ONE

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
INTO A NURSING HOME, I'M

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
DEFINITELY GOING TO LOOK ONLINE

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
AND MAKE SURE IT'S A GOOD ONE,"

20:09.000 --> 20:09.000
WELL, BE CAREFUL.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
BECAUSE WHILE THE GOVERNMENT

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
DOES HAVE A WEBSITE WHERE

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
NURSING HOMES ARE RATED FROM ONE

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
TO FIVE STARS, IT HAS AN

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE LOOPHOLE.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
>> OF THE THREE FACTORS THAT

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
DETERMINE AN OVERALL RATING,

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
ONLY THE HEALTH INSPECTIONS ARE

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
CONDUCTED INDEPENDENTLY.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
THE OTHER STATISTICS, STAFFING

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
AND QUALITY MEASURES, ARE

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
SELF-REPORTED BY THE NURSING

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
HOME.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
THESE SELF-REPORTED STATISTICS

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
CAN BOOST A THREE-STAR RATING

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
INTO A FIVE-STAR RATING OVERALL.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
>> THE PROBLEM IS, YOU KNOW,

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
IT'S GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
SO WHATEVER THEY'RE TELLING THE

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
FEDS, THE FEDS ARE NOT -- THAT

20:41.000 --> 20:41.000
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ISN'T GOING

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
IN AND DOUBLE-CHECKING THAT

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
THEIR NUMBERS ARE ACCURATE.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
>> John: YEAH.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
"GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT."

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
AND THAT IS PATHETIC.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
SOMETHING IMPORTANT AS OUR

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
NURSING HOME RATING SYSTEM

20:53.000 --> 20:53.000
SHOULDN'T FOLLOW THE SAME RULE

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
AS EVERY RECIPE ON VELVEETA'S

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
WEBSITE.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
BECAUSE THERE'S JUST NO WAY ANY

20:59.000 --> 20:59.000
OF THOSE ARE GOOD.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
IF YOU'RE MAKING A RECIPE

21:01.000 --> 21:01.000
THAT CALLS FOR A PUDDLE OF

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
LORAX JIZZ, THEN DON'T BE

21:02.000 --> 21:09.000
SURPRISED WHEN THE FINISHED

21:09.000 --> 21:09.000
PRODUCT IS EQUALLY REPULSIVE.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
IT'S GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT.

21:10.000 --> 21:10.000
SO GIVEN EVERYTHING YOU'VE SEEN,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
IT'S HARDLY SURPRISING THAT --

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
FOR REASONS OF COST OR

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
CONDITIONS -- MANY MIGHT WANT TO

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
AVOID A NURSING HOME ALTOGETHER.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
WHICH BRINGS US TO ASSISTED

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
LIVING FACILITIES, OR ALFs.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
AROUND A THIRD OF PEOPLE IN

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
LONG-TERM CARE ARE IN ONE OF

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
THESE, AND THEY DO COST FAR LESS

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
THAN A NURSING HOME -- TYPICALLY

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
AROUND $50,000 A YEAR.

21:31.000 --> 21:31.000
ALFs STARTED OUT AS AN

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
ALTERNATIVE FOR THOSE WHO NEEDED

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
HELP WITH KEY ACTIVITIES -- LIKE

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
DRESSING, TOILETING, TAKING

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
MEDICINES AND EATING -- BUT ONLY

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
NEEDED LIMITED MEDICAL SUPPORT.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
JUST AS WITH NURSING HOMES, THE

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
VAST MAJORITY OF ALFs ARE

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
FOR-PROFIT.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME KEY

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
DIFFERENCES.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
ALFs ARE LARGELY PAID FOR

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
OUT-OF-POCKET.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
AND THEY ARE FAR LESS REGULATED,

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
MAKING EASY FOR BASICALLY ANYONE

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
TO START ONE.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
AND I DO MEAN ANYONE.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
TAKE STEPHANIE COSTA.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
BY 30, SHE OWNED SIX SMALL ALFs

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND HAD

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
MADE A LOT OF MONEY FROM THEM,

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
ENOUGH TO QUALIFY HER TO

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
APPEAR IN AN EPISODE OF

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
"THE MILLIONAIRE MATCHMAKER."

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
>> MY NAME IS STEPHANIE AND I'M

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
30 YEARS OLD AND I OWN A CHAIN

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
OF ELDERLY CARE FACILITIES.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
MY NET WORTH IS $3-4 MILLION,

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
PROBABLY.

22:22.000 --> 22:22.000
I'VE ALWAYS HAD THIS THING OF

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
TAKING CARE OF OLDER PEOPLE.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
LIKE SICK, PEOPLE THAT ARE

22:24.000 --> 22:24.000
DYING.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
I'VE ALWAYS REALLY FELT FOR

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
THEM.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
SO I COULDN'T WAIT TO GRADUATE

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
COLLEGE AND START MY OWN

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
BUSINESS DOING ASSISTED LIVING

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
FACILITIES LIKE NURSING HOMES.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
>> John: OKAY.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
THERE ARE A LOT OF UNFAIR

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
REASONS THAT I INHERENTLY DON'T

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
TRUST STEPHANIE COSTA, FROM HER

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
DRIVING A DOUCHEY FERRARI TO THE

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
FACT SHE LOOKS LIKE AN

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
UNCREDITED EXTRA FROM AN

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
"ENTOURAGE" PARTY SCENE TO THAT

22:42.000 --> 22:42.000
VOICE, WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A MOUSE

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
WHO WOULDN'T DRESS CINDERELLA

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
BECAUSE IT HAD BETTER THINGS TO

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
DO.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT

22:50.000 --> 22:50.000
GUT FEELING IS ENTIRELY VALID,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
BECAUSE COSTA TREATED HER

22:52.000 --> 22:52.000
EMPLOYEES AND RESIDENTS SO

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
TERRIBLY THAT, AFTER MULTIPLE

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS,

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
CALIFORNIA BANNED COSTA FROM THE

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
INDUSTRY FOR LIFE AND ORDERED

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
HER AND HER COMPANY TO PAY ABOUT

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
$1.6 MILLION FOR UNPAID

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
WAGES AND PENALTIES.

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
BUT IF YOU THINK THAT GAVE HER

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
ACCOUNTABILITY, YOU'RE GOING TO

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
WANT TO THINK AGAIN.

23:11.000 --> 23:11.000
>> SHE KEPT THIS HOME AFTER

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY AND

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
SETTLED WITH WORKERS FOR A

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
FRACTION OF WHAT SHE OWED.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
HER SIX CARE HOMES ARE NOW OWNED

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
BY A PROPERTY INVESTMENT COMPANY

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
REGISTERED BY HER FATHER.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
>> John: OH, YEAH.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
NOT JUST THAT, AS RECENTLY AS

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
LAST YEAR, SHE WAS STILL LISTED

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
AS THAT COMPANY'S CEO.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
SO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
REALLY TAUGHT STEPHANIE COSTA A

23:30.000 --> 23:30.000
LESSON THERE.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
SPECIFICALLY, THE LESSON THAT

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
YOU CAN TREAT YOUR ELDER CARE

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
WORKERS LIKE ABSOLUTE SHIT,

23:33.000 --> 23:33.000
AVOID ANY REAL CONSEQUENCES, AND

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
JUST KEEP LIVING YOUR LIFE IN

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
THE SINGLE UGLIEST HOME IN

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
BEVERLY HILLS -- ALTHOUGH IT'S

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
LEGITIMATELY HARD TO TELL

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
WHETHER THAT'S ACTUALLY A HOME

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
OR JUST AN ABANDONED

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
WHITE CASTLE.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
BUT IT'S NOT JUST INDIVIDUALS

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
INVOLVED HERE.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
THERE ARE ALSO BIG CORPORATIONS

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
RUNNING ALFs, WHO'VE BEEN

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
WORKING HARD TO FILL BEDS.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
AND DESPITE THE FACT ALFs ARE

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
SUPPOSED TO BE FOR PEOPLE WHO

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
REQUIRE LESS MEDICAL ATTENTION,

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
RECENTLY, SOME HAVE BEEN

23:55.000 --> 24:03.000
AGGRESSIVELY COURTING DEMENTIA

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
PATIENTS FOR MEMORY CARE

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
PROGRAMS, AS SEEN IN THIS

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
ADVERTISEMENT FOR BROOKDALE, THE

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
LARGEST ALF PROVIDER IN THE

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
COUNTRY.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
>> THIS IS A COMPASSIONATE PLACE

24:10.000 --> 24:10.000
THAT HELPS FAMILIES THROUGH VERY

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
DIFFICULT STAGES OF DEMENTIA IN

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
A SAFE AND COMFORTABLE SETTING,

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
AND I HAVE PEACE OF MIND KNOWING

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
THERE IS A STAFF, FULLY TRAINED,

24:14.000 --> 24:14.000
24 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
WEEK.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH MY

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
MOM'S QUALITY OF LIFE HAS

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
IMPROVED SINCE COMING HERE.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
I'M SEEING HER SMILING AND

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
LAUGHING AGAIN.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
>> WE HELP THEM MAINTAIN THEIR

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
ABILITIES AND ENCOURAGE THE USE

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
OF THEIR CURRENT SKILLS IN A

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
WARM, ENGAGING ENVIRONMENT.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
>> THIS IS A SPECIAL PLACE, AND

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
EVERY DAY IS A NEW BEGINNING

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
WITH LOTS OF SMILES AND

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
MEMORIES.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
>> John: OKAY.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
I GET THAT A SENIOR LIVING

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
COMMERCIAL MIGHT WANT TO HAVE AT

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
LEAST ONE STAFFER WITH THEIR

24:39.000 --> 24:39.000
ARMS AROUND A RESIDENT'S

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
SHOULDERS.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
THAT'S KIND OF NICE.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
TRUSTWORTHY.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
MAKES YOU FEEL SAFE.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
BUT IMMEDIATELY CUTTING TO

24:44.000 --> 24:44.000
ANOTHER ONE FEELS LIKE A BIT

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
MUCH.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
AND THEN A THIRD STARTS TO MAKE

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
ME FEEL A LITTLE NERVOUS.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
AND WHEN THAT FOURTH HITS, AS A

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
BRITISH PERSON, I'VE GOT TO SAY,

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
THAT IS JUST TOO MUCH PHYSICAL

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
CONTACT.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
THAT SAID, EVEN I'LL ADMIT, AN

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
ALF THAT OFFERED ALL THAT

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
COMMERCIAL CLAIMS TO BUT WITH

25:02.000 --> 25:02.000
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS TOUCHING

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
WOULD BE GREAT.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
UNFORTUNATELY, A WOMAN WHO

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
WORKED AT A BROOKDALE FACILITY

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
IN SOUTH CAROLINA PAINTED A VERY

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
DIFFERENT PICTURE OF HOW

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
STAFFERS ARE TRAINED TO WORK

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
WITH DEMENTIA PATIENTS.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
>> WHEN YOU FIRST START, THEY

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
HAVE YOU SIT THROUGH A SERIES

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
OF IN-SERVICES OR ORIENTATION

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
AND IT LASTS ABOUT A WEEK, BUT

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
IT'S JUST VIDEO, BUT ONCE

25:23.000 --> 25:23.000
THEY PUT YOU OUT ON THE FLOOR,

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
THEY DON'T -- THEY DON'T GIVE

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
YOU ANY TRAINING.

25:25.000 --> 25:31.000
THEY JUST STICK YOU OUT THERE.

25:31.000 --> 25:36.000
>> John: WELL, THAT'S NOT REALLY

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
IDEAL, IS IT?

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
IT'S HARD TO RETAIN IMPORTANT

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
INFORMATION JUST BY WATCHING A

25:39.000 --> 25:39.000
VIDEO.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
CASE IN POINT: THIS VIDEO.

25:41.000 --> 25:41.000
THINK ABOUT IT.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
WHAT HAVE YOU REALLY LEARNED

25:42.000 --> 25:42.000
FROM THIS?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
SURE, A FEW RANDOM FACTS ABOUT

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
THE LONG-TERM CARE INDUSTRY THAT

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
YOU'LL PROBABLY IMMEDIATELY FORGET.

25:45.000 --> 25:45.000
BUT MAINLY, YOU'VE LEARNED THAT

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
IT'S POSSIBLE TO WANT TO FUCK A

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
PLATE.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
AND THAT'S A LESSON YOU WILL

25:51.000 --> 25:51.000
NEVER FORGET.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
AND BROOKDALE INSISTS THAT IT

25:52.000 --> 25:52.000
OFFERS ONGOING TRAINING FOR ITS

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
WORKERS AND THAT ITS TRAINING

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
PROGRAM FOR DEMENTIA CARE

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
WORKERS MEETS OR EXCEEDS STATE

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
GUIDELINES.

26:00.000 --> 26:06.000
BUT THAT IS NOT REALLY SAYING

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
MUCH, AS SOME STATES ONLY

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
REQUIRE TWO TO 30 HOURS, AND

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
SOUTH CAROLINA -- WHERE THAT

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
FACILITY IS LOCATED -- HAS NO

26:15.000 --> 26:15.000
STATE MINIMUM AT ALL.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU'RE

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
WONDERING ABOUT WHY THERE WERE A

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
BUNCH OF SHOTS OF A POND IN THAT

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
STORY, THE ANSWER IS HORRIFYING.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
BECAUSE A 90-YEAR-OLD RESIDENT

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
THERE, WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
UNDER CONSTANT SUPERVISION

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
BEFORE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
MEMORY CARE UNIT, DIED AFTER

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
LEAVING THE FACILITY UNNOTICED

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
>> THERE ARE SIGNS OUT HERE

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
WARNING PEOPLE ABOUT ALLIGATORS.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ONE, IT

26:34.000 --> 26:34.000
SAYS, "ALLIGATORS MAY LIVE HERE,

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
BE GATOR SAFE."

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
IN THIS CASE, THE SIGNS PROBABLY

26:37.000 --> 26:37.000
WOULD NOT HAVE MADE A

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
DIFFERENCE, ACCORDING TO

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
AUTHORITIES.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
WE'RE TOLD THE VICTIM LIKELY

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
SLIPPED OR FELL DOWN A STEEP

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
EMBANKMENT AND LANDED IN THE

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
WATER, ATTRACTING THE GATOR'S

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
ATTENTION.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
>> John: HOLY FUCKING SHIT.

26:48.000 --> 26:53.000
I HONESTLY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE

26:53.000 --> 26:53.000
TO BEGIN THERE.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
BUT I GUESS I'D START WITH: WHY

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
WOULD ANYONE PUT AN ASSISTED

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
LIVING FACILITY NEXT TO A

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
FUCKING ALLIGATOR POND?

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
THAT SEEMS LIKE THE SORT OF

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
DETAIL THAT REALLY HAS TO BE

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
INCLUDED AT THE END OF ONE OF

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
BROOKDALE'S HEARTWARMING ADS.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
>> THIS IS A SPECIAL PLACE AND

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
EVERY DAY IS A NEW BEGINNING

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
WITH LOTS OF SMILES AND

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
MEMORIES.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
ALSO, ONE OF OUR RESIDENTS

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
WAS EATEN BY AN ALLIGATOR, SO...

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Y'KNOW...

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
THERE'S THAT.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
>> John: YEAH.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
THERE IS THAT.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT INFORMATION

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW, BROOKDALE.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
AND LOOK, OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S AN

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
APPALLING STORY.

27:27.000 --> 27:27.000
BUT TO BE FAIR, IT IS HARD TO

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
TALK ABOUT LONG-TERM CARE

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
WITHOUT SHOWING YOU AT LEAST ONE

27:29.000 --> 27:29.000
OF THOSE.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
JUST BE GRATEFUL I DIDN'T SHOW

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
YOU THE STORY WHERE A RESIDENT

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
JUMPED FROM A FOURTH-STORY

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
WINDOW OF AN ALF, OR THE ONE

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
ABOUT A NURSING HOME RESIDENT

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
WHO SET HERSELF ON FIRE, OR THE

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
ONE ABOUT A 91-YEAR-OLD

27:39.000 --> 27:39.000
SUFFERING FROM ALZHEIMER'S WHO

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
FROZE TO DEATH ON CHRISTMAS DAY.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
WHICH, BY THE WAY SOUNDS LIKE A

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
HOLIDAY ALBUM WRITTEN BY

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
FUCKING BJORK.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
WELL, OBVIOUSLY, INCREASED

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT ARE

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
BADLY NEEDED.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
THAT FACILITY WITH THE

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
ALLIGATORS WAS EVENTUALLY FINED

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
BY THE STATE FOR 11 VIOLATIONS,

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
INCLUDING NOT PROPERLY

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
PERFORMING NIGHT CHECKS AND

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
LETTING STAFFING DROP BELOW

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
REQUIRED LEVELS, BUT THE PENALTY

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
ISSUED WAS JUST $6,400.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
AND IT FEELS LIKE IF YOU LOST A

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
LOVED ONE IN SUCH A HORRIFIC

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
WAY, YOU'D WANT MORE

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
ACCOUNTABILITY THAN "DON'T

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
WORRY, SOMEONE DECIDED THEIR

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
LIFE WAS WORTH THE PRICE OF A

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
2013 CHRYSLER MOTOWN."

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
AND THE FACT IS, THERE ARE LOTS

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
OF IDEAS ON HOW TO FORCE

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
FACILITIES TO IMPROVE --

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
MANDATING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
MONEY HAS TO GO TO PATIENT CARE,

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
FOR INSTANCE, OR THAT RESIDENTS

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
HAVE ACCESS TO A MINIMUM AMOUNT

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
OF CARE PER DAY.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
BUT THE BIGGER FIX HERE MIGHT BE

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
TO TRY AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR AS

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE NOT TO

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
END UP IN THESE INSTITUTIONS IN

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
THE FIRST PLACE AND INSTEAD

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
RECEIVE WHATEVER SUPPORT THEY

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
NEED AT HOME.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
NEARLY 90% OF PEOPLE OVER 65

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
APPARENTLY WANT TO STAY IN THEIR

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
HOME FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE,

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
WHICH DOES MAKE SENSE.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
THE PROBLEM IS, RIGHT NOW, MANY

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
OF THEM CAN'T, BECAUSE UNDER

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
MEDICAID, NURSING HOME CARE IS

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
AN ENTITLEMENT -- BUT HOME-BASED

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
CARE IS NOT.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
TO ACCESS LONG-TERM SERVICES AND

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
SUPPORTS THROUGH MEDICAID IN

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
YOUR HOME, YOU NEED A WAIVER

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
FROM YOUR STATE.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
AND TO BE FAIR, SOME, LIKE

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
WASHINGTON, DO THAT PRETTY WELL.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
MORE THAN 70% OF THE MEDICAID

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
MONEY THEY SPEND ON LONG-TERM

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
CARE FOR OLDER PEOPLE AND ADULTS

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
WITH DISABILITIES IS SPENT ON

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
SERVICES -- THINGS LIKE SKILLED

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
NURSING VISITS, HOME CARE AIDES

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
WHO CAN HELP WITH DAILY TASKS,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
AND EVEN THE ABILITY TO PAY

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
FAMILY CAREGIVERS.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE LIKE THOSE TWO

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
WOMEN YOU SAW EARLIER.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
THE PROBLEM IS, OTHER STATES

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
HAVE WAITING LISTS THAT CAN BE

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
MANY YEARS LONG, BY WHICH POINT,

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
SENIORS TRYING TO ACCESS THAT

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
CARE CAN BE DEAD, BECAUSE,

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
SADLY, THAT IS HOW TIME WORKS.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
NATIONWIDE, MORE THAN 800,000

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
PEOPLE ARE ON THESE KINDS OF

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
WAITING LISTS.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
WHAT WE NEED IS REFORM AT A

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
NATIONAL LEVEL -- AND THERE ARE

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
ACTUALLY SOME PROMISING

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
DEVELOPMENTS HERE.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
A DISCUSSION DRAFT OF A BILL WAS

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
RECENTLY INTRODUCED THAT WOULD

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
MAKE HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
CARE AN ENTITLEMENT UNDER

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
MEDICAID.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
AND BIDEN'S PROPOSED

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN ACTUALLY

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
CALLS FOR $400 BILLION TO BE

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
SPENT ON THOSE EXACT SERVICES.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
AND THAT WOULD BE A BIG DEAL.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
AND LOOK, AGGRESSIVE TRANSITION

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
TO HOME-BASED CARE IS GOING TO

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
NEED RIGOROUS GUARDRAILS AND

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
MONEY IS NOT MISSPENT, JUST IN A

30:17.000 --> 30:17.000
DIFFERENT WAY.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
THE LAST THING I WANT IS, FIVE

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
YEARS FROM NOW, TO BE HAVING TO

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
DO A SHOW ON THE EVILS OF

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
NEW FOR-PROFIT HOME CARE

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
AGENCIES WHO'VE BEEN DESTROYING

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
PEOPLE'S LIVES IN THEIR OWN

30:26.000 --> 30:26.000
HOMES.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WAIT,

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
FIVE YEARS FROM NOW YOU'LL STILL

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
BE DOING SHOWS IN THE VOID?"

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
OH, NO.

30:32.000 --> 30:32.000
WE'LL BE BACK IN THE VOID.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
SPECIFICS, BUT --

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
SPOILER ALERT --

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
IT'S NOT A PANDEMIC NEXT TIME!

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
IT'S SPIDERS.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
BUT WE DO NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
AND IT ALL STARTS WITH SHOWING

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
THAT WE GIVE A SHIT ABOUT WHAT

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
HAPPENS TO THE ELDERLY AND

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN THIS

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
COUNTRY, 'CAUSE RIGHT NOW,

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
EVIDENCE POINTS TO THE FACT THAT

30:53.000 --> 30:53.000
WE ABSOLUTELY DON'T, AND ALL THE

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
OTHER PROBLEMS ARE STEMMING FROM

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
THAT.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
AND THE LONGER WE CONTINUE TO

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
IGNORE THIS, THE WORSE IT'S

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
GOING TO GET.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, RIGHT NOW,

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
THIS IS AN INDUSTRY WHERE THE

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
PEOPLE IN ITS CARE ARE BEING

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
FIGURATIVELY -- AND SOMETIMES

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
LITERALLY -- EATEN ALIVE.

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
AND NOW THIS.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
>> Announcer: AND NOW, A FEW

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
MORE OF THE GREATEST QUESTIONS

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
EVER ASKED ON YAHOO! ANSWERS.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
>> HOW DO I GET SPAGHETTI STANDS

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
OFF MY UNDERWEAR.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
IS IT OKAY TO GET A TRAMPOLINE

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
WET ONCE AND A WHILE?

31:31.000 --> 31:38.000
DOES THE MOVIE "AIR BUD" PAINT

31:38.000 --> 31:43.000
ACCURATE PICTURE OF A DOG'S

31:43.000 --> 31:43.000
SKILL?

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
MY DAD IS A GOLF, WHAT DO I DO?

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
WHY ARE THE HOLES AND KETCHUP

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
ARE ALWAYS IN THE RIGHT PLACES

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
FOR THEIR EYES?

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
WHY WASN'T I BORN AN OCTOPUS?

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
CAN A BIRD STAY ON A CLOUD?

31:58.000 --> 32:08.000
HOW DO I FIX MY FARTING PENIS?

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
HOW DO I TURN OFF MY CAPS LOCK?

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
>> John: THAT'S OUR SHOW,

32:14.000 --> 32:19.000
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING,

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
GOOD NIGHT.
