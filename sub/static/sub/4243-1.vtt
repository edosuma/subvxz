WEBVTT

00:06.042 --> 00:07.571
All right, kids. Show me what you got.

00:07.572 --> 00:10.091
Ready? Five, six, seven, eight.

00:10.092 --> 00:13.087
Welcome to NYADA.

00:13.088 --> 00:16.065
This is Dance 101,
my name's Cassandra July,

00:16.067 --> 00:19.016
and if you are not suffering
from severe body dysmorphia,

00:19.017 --> 00:22.003
then you don't want it enough.

00:22.004 --> 00:24.000
Let's get this straight, freshmen:

00:24.001 --> 00:26.016
There's maybe two of you in this room

00:26.017 --> 00:28.002
that are good enough
to make it in this business.

00:28.003 --> 00:30.133
As for the rest of you,

00:30.134 --> 00:34.087
thank you for paying my
rent on my loft in Soho.

00:34.088 --> 00:36.041
Hey. What's your name?

00:36.042 --> 00:37.095
Uh, Lydia.

00:37.096 --> 00:40.016
No, no, your name's Muffin Top,

00:40.017 --> 00:42.061
and from now on,
it's rice cakes and ipecac.

00:42.062 --> 00:45.042
Or cut off a butt cheek,
'cause you need to drop a few.

00:47.038 --> 00:49.024
Hold it.

00:49.025 --> 00:50.074
I'm sorry.

00:50.075 --> 00:54.074
Did my conversation with
Muffin Top offend you?

00:54.075 --> 00:56.004
- No.
- Hmm?

00:56.005 --> 00:57.038
What's your name?

00:57.039 --> 00:59.012
- Rachel.
- Little Miss...

00:59.015 --> 01:01.088
- David Schwimmer?
- Little Miss David Schwimmer.

01:01.091 --> 01:05.019
I bet you were
a big star back in Iowa.

01:05.021 --> 01:07.012
- I'm actually from Ohio.
- Ohio.

01:07.013 --> 01:08.046
That's even worse.

01:08.047 --> 01:10.028
You ever look at a map?

01:10.029 --> 01:13.479
Ohio is like a giant turd that
Michigan just can't pinch off.

01:13.480 --> 01:15.811
So did you come all the way
to New York City

01:15.812 --> 01:17.071
to show me how to run my class?

01:17.072 --> 01:20.058
- No, I... I came to learn.
- Okay.

01:20.061 --> 01:22.028
Lesson number one:

01:22.029 --> 01:23.288
Your piqué turns are pathetic,

01:23.289 --> 01:28.000
and your stuck-up little attitude's
really pissing me off. Music!

01:30.025 --> 01:32.028
All right, let's go!

01:32.029 --> 01:34.045
Energy in your fingers.

01:34.046 --> 01:36.024
Higher. Higher.

01:36.025 --> 01:38.020
Into the ground.
Higher!

01:38.021 --> 01:39.083
Higher, higher!

01:39.084 --> 01:42.046
- Come on!
- I don't need any help.

01:42.047 --> 01:44.217
No, no, sweetie, I'm not
coming down here to help you.

01:44.218 --> 01:47.016
I'm coming down here to give you
a big New York City welcome.

01:47.017 --> 01:49.017
You suck.

01:56.038 --> 01:57.616
What's up, blogosphere?

01:57.652 --> 01:59.722
Jacob Ben Israel here,
back on the street

01:59.723 --> 02:03.659
with an exclusive look at
McKinley's newest celebrities,

02:03.660 --> 02:04.710
the New Directions!

02:04.711 --> 02:07.651
Artie Abrams, lunch room sources tell me

02:07.652 --> 02:09.651
you've been seen sitting with Cheerios!

02:09.651 --> 02:11.638
Well, I'm usually sitting.

02:11.639 --> 02:14.651
But, yes, and I can tell you it
is great to finally be popular.

02:14.652 --> 02:16.151
National champs, baby!

02:16.179 --> 02:17.232
Whoo!

02:17.233 --> 02:21.173
Sam Evans: from hobo stripper
to Glee club celebrity.

02:21.174 --> 02:23.216
- How does it feel?
- Awesome, and about time.

02:23.217 --> 02:26.204
I never thought I'd have a
freshman for a personal assistant.

02:28.183 --> 02:30.190
This isn't organic.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.178
Wow. "C You Next Tina."

02:32.179 --> 02:33.250
Do Taylor Lautner again.

02:33.251 --> 02:35.199
Bella, I love you.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.229
And I am a werewolf.

02:38.183 --> 02:40.285
Is it true you broke up
with Mike Chang

02:40.286 --> 02:42.450
a week after tattooing
"Mike Chang 4ever" on your hip

02:42.451 --> 02:45.161
because the long-distance
thing was too hard?

02:45.162 --> 02:47.165
Um... okay.

02:47.166 --> 02:49.178
I still love him,
and we're still friends,

02:49.179 --> 02:52.253
and I changed the tattoo
to "Make Change 4ever."

02:52.254 --> 02:54.228
Change is good.

02:54.229 --> 02:58.211
They said Rachel Berry was
the group's undisputed star,

02:58.212 --> 03:02.161
so, really, the only question is:

03:02.162 --> 03:04.215
Which one of you is the new Rachel?

03:04.216 --> 03:06.162
- I am. - I am.
- I am.

03:09.258 --> 03:12.178
<i>It's nice to know I'm missed.</i>

03:12.179 --> 03:14.162
<i>New York can make a girl feel lonely.</i>

03:14.163 --> 03:16.165
<i>I miss my dads.
I miss Finn.</i>

03:16.166 --> 03:18.257
<i>I haven't heard
from him in two months.</i>

03:18.258 --> 03:21.203
<i>Maybe he's just trying to
give me the space I need</i>

03:21.204 --> 03:24.165
<i>to make it on my own.
Surrender, right?</i>

03:24.166 --> 03:25.191
<i>I'm sure that's it.</i>

03:25.192 --> 03:27.190
<i>My roommate seems nice.</i>

03:27.191 --> 03:30.182
<i>Well, I haven't officially met her.</i>

03:30.183 --> 03:32.327
<i>She's usually busy with
company, but she sounds nice.</i>

03:32.328 --> 03:34.233
<i>I just wish Kurt had
gotten into NYADA with me.</i>

03:36.204 --> 03:38.222
<i>The co-ed bathrooms take
some getting used to.</i>

03:38.223 --> 03:42.181
<i>I got tired of everyone's opinion
of my extensive nighttime ritual,</i>

03:42.182 --> 03:44.191
<i>so I started showering
at 3:00 in the morning</i>

03:44.192 --> 03:46.245

Hey. You're a freshman, right?

04:28.170 --> 04:29.210
Yeah, I'm Rachel Berry.

04:29.211 --> 04:30.541
I'm majoring in musical theater.

04:30.542 --> 04:33.190
Me, too. Brody Weston.

04:33.191 --> 04:35.187
- I'm a junior.
- Hi.

04:35.188 --> 04:40.169
Well, you survived your first class
with Cassie, so you must be good.

04:40.170 --> 04:42.866
- Is she, uh, always that awful?
- Yeah, she's tough.

04:42.867 --> 04:45.243
But I wouldn't have gotten that
chorus gig in the revival of

04:45.244 --> 04:47.237
<i>Working </i> last summer if
she didn't push me so hard.

04:47.238 --> 04:49.169
You were on Broadway?

04:49.170 --> 04:51.194
Steel Worker Number Three.

04:51.195 --> 04:53.170
Show lasted for, like,
three performances,

04:54.281 --> 04:55.359
but still...

04:55.360 --> 04:57.318
I like to come in here at night, too.

04:57.319 --> 05:00.292
People give me a hard time
about my moisturizing ritual.

05:00.293 --> 05:02.310
- Me, too.
- We're actors, right?

05:02.313 --> 05:05.364
Our skin is like our
paintbrush <i>and </i> our canvas.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.350
Actually, I'm not really
sleeping much, lately.

05:10.351 --> 05:13.346
Not a lot of city noise
in Lima, Ohio.

05:13.347 --> 05:17.304
I just think everything takes
a little getting used to, but... yeah.

05:17.305 --> 05:19.342
You'll be fine.

05:19.343 --> 05:24.272
Just remember, you're here
because you're the best of the best.

05:25.293 --> 05:27.293
Start believing that.

05:29.343 --> 05:31.282
Oh, and, in case
you were wondering...

05:31.283 --> 05:32.318
which you were...

05:32.319 --> 05:34.301
I'm straight.

05:36.364 --> 05:39.960
So he was wearing a towel that was
barely covering his tinkletube,

05:39.961 --> 05:41.350
and he's straight? Hot.

05:41.351 --> 05:42.358
Do you like him?

05:42.359 --> 05:44.339
No, you know I'll always love Finn.

05:44.340 --> 05:46.342
Oh, and I love you,
I miss you like crazy,.

05:46.343 --> 05:48.455
Oh, is that why you're
calling me every three hours?

05:48.456 --> 05:50.355
Well, I just want to make
sure that you're okay.

05:50.356 --> 05:52.359
I'm great, I love it here.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.367
My dance teacher worships me.

05:54.368 --> 05:56.304
But how are you?
Are you okay?

05:56.305 --> 05:58.355
- I'm keeping busy.
- Where are you right now?

05:58.358 --> 06:00.367
I just passed Mrs. Hagberg's
old classroom.

06:00.368 --> 06:03.346
Figured I'd stop by McKinley
and meet their newest addition.

06:03.347 --> 06:07.304
Porcelain, this is my daughter Robin.

06:07.305 --> 06:10.367
I've loved the name ever since
I was a little girl.

06:10.368 --> 06:14.288
It recalls hope, and springtime,

06:14.289 --> 06:16.329
and my favorite dead Bee Gee.

06:16.330 --> 06:18.325
Oh, she's the love of my life.

06:18.326 --> 06:22.367
And I'm so...
so devoted to her.

06:22.368 --> 06:24.300
Kitty! Get in here.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.366
Yes, Coach Sylvester?

06:25.367 --> 06:28.364
I need you to change Robin's diaper,
and then sing her a lullaby.

06:28.365 --> 06:32.359
Preferably something not yet
butchered by the Glee club.

06:32.360 --> 06:34.300
Good luck finding one.

06:34.301 --> 06:36.279
Porcelain, this is Kitty.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.422
Kitty is my new head bitch.

06:37.423 --> 06:39.800
She's like a young Quinn Fabray,
except she's not pregnant,

06:39.842 --> 06:41.762
manic-depressive,
or in and out of a wheelchair.

06:41.763 --> 06:43.451
Shouldn't you be
in college or something?

06:43.452 --> 06:46.367
I thought gay people were
all successful overachievers.

06:46.368 --> 06:47.860
I am a successful...

06:47.861 --> 06:49.651
Oh, don't pay attention
to what Kitty thinks,

06:49.654 --> 06:52.321
even if it's exactly what
the rest of the world thinks.

06:52.322 --> 06:55.275
I'm actually very proud
of you, Twinkletush.

06:55.276 --> 06:56.330
You're a real trailblazer.

06:56.331 --> 06:59.824
You know, it used to be that just
straight ex-football players

06:59.825 --> 07:02.749
would lurk the halls of high schools
after graduation, but you've proven

07:02.750 --> 07:04.410
that gay ex-show choir
champs can also be

07:04.411 --> 07:07.313
depressive sad sacks desperately
clinging to the past.

07:07.314 --> 07:08.353
I'm not a sad sack, okay?

07:08.354 --> 07:11.349
My classes at Allen County Community
College start next week...

07:11.350 --> 07:13.647
I'm sorry, I tuned out the
moment you opened your mouth.

07:13.648 --> 07:16.304
Keep living the dream, Porcelain.

07:16.305 --> 07:17.334
Glee!

07:19.364 --> 07:21.347
We are coming off of
a National Championship,

07:21.348 --> 07:22.888
but it's time to look forward,

07:22.889 --> 07:25.347
and thanks to Glee now being
the coolest club in the school,

07:25.348 --> 07:27.330
- Whoo!
- Right on.

07:27.331 --> 07:28.534
This shouldn't be a problem.

07:29.368 --> 07:31.330
All right.

07:34.351 --> 07:36.304
Yes, we've lost some big voices.

07:36.305 --> 07:37.978
But we still have
some huge ones in here.

07:37.979 --> 07:40.751
And I promise to do everything I can
to replace the ones that we lost.

07:40.752 --> 07:43.363
And on that note,
I'd like to introduce you

07:43.364 --> 07:46.313
to our newest member: The MVP
of last year's nationals,

07:46.314 --> 07:48.284
Wade "Unique" Adams.

07:49.364 --> 07:50.760
That's a great haircut, Mercedes.

07:50.761 --> 07:52.342
I thought you graduated.

07:52.343 --> 07:54.547
I wanted to be somewhere where
different was celebrated.

07:54.548 --> 07:57.330
We are so excited to have you.

07:58.355 --> 08:01.321
Guys... where's the love?

08:01.322 --> 08:03.301
I think Wade is great,
but the competition

08:03.302 --> 08:05.363
to be the new Rachel
is already so intense,

08:05.364 --> 08:07.333
the last thing that we
need is one more contender.

08:07.334 --> 08:09.301
"The New Rachel"?

08:09.302 --> 08:11.270
Every Glee club needs a star performer.

08:11.271 --> 08:12.939
Rachel was that,
and now that she's gone,

08:12.940 --> 08:14.329
many of us want the job.

08:14.330 --> 08:16.292
Okay, we don't win with stars.

08:16.293 --> 08:17.303
We win as a team.

08:17.304 --> 08:18.555
One that supports new members.

08:18.556 --> 08:20.355
Now, I don't want to hear
any more of this...

08:20.356 --> 08:22.313
this "New Rachel" stuff, okay?

08:22.314 --> 08:24.334
Have a seat, Wade.

08:28.293 --> 08:29.326
Make no mistake:

08:29.327 --> 08:31.343
Unique will be the new Rachel.

08:33.284 --> 08:34.650
We decide this on our own, then...

08:34.652 --> 08:36.283
Thunderdome style.

08:36.284 --> 08:38.284
5:00, in the auditorium.

08:43.272 --> 08:44.349
So, here are the rules:

08:44.350 --> 08:46.360
We perform the song for Artie,
he makes his choice,

08:46.361 --> 08:48.317
we go to Mr. Shue as a group,

08:48.318 --> 08:50.350
and we tell him who
the new lead soloist is.

08:50.351 --> 08:53.333
Hopefully, it'll be me, 'cause
that's what Rachel wanted.

08:53.334 --> 08:55.751
Though I am uncomfortable doing
this behind Mr. Shue's back,

08:55.752 --> 08:57.329
I am a director.

08:57.330 --> 08:59.751
Therefore, I never pass up on
an opportunity to judge people.

08:59.752 --> 09:02.313
What song are we singing?

09:02.314 --> 09:04.278
What Rachel would sing,
if she were here.

09:04.279 --> 09:05.860
The song of the summer,
"Call Me Maybe."

09:05.861 --> 09:07.351
- Yes.
- Do you need time to prepare?

09:07.354 --> 09:09.367
I can sing any song, any time.

09:09.368 --> 09:11.346
Just press play, and get back.

11:09.326 --> 11:11.321
So, how's Santana?

11:11.322 --> 11:14.292
She's good. She's just really
busy with cheerleading practice,

11:14.293 --> 11:16.338
and it's hard making out over Skype.

11:16.339 --> 11:18.338
You can't really scissor a Webcam.

11:18.339 --> 11:21.464
Here's an extra hot soy latte for him,
and a no-chocolate for her.

11:21.465 --> 11:23.309
Yes.

11:23.310 --> 11:25.321
I can't wait till Friday.

11:25.322 --> 11:26.333
Why?

11:26.334 --> 11:27.362
Glee Club auditions.

11:27.363 --> 11:28.343
That sounds like fun.

11:28.344 --> 11:30.329
Pretty nice.

11:30.330 --> 11:33.326
Is it depressing that I'm more excited
about it than either of you?

11:33.327 --> 11:34.355
- Yeah.
- No, not at all.

11:34.358 --> 11:36.271
Just a little bit.

11:36.272 --> 11:38.334
- No, it's...
- Excuse me. Garcon?

11:42.314 --> 11:44.342
My ice latte's too cold.

11:44.343 --> 11:46.304
It's an iced latte.

11:46.305 --> 11:47.718
It's an iced latte that's too cold.

11:47.719 --> 11:51.275
I'm gonna need you
to make me a new one.

11:51.276 --> 11:52.778
Hello?

11:52.779 --> 11:55.380
Hey, Kurt, you got to refill the
biscotti Barrel every 15 minutes.

11:55.402 --> 11:57.310
Coming.

11:58.347 --> 12:01.297
I'll be right back with your latte.

12:03.310 --> 12:04.351
- Uh, Miss July?
- Yeah?

12:04.354 --> 12:07.329
I, uh, I don't know
how to tell you this,

12:07.330 --> 12:10.325
but I can't be your TA this year.

12:10.326 --> 12:12.297
I start <i>Wicked </i> rehearsals tomorrow.

12:12.298 --> 12:14.195
I'm just playing
a flying monkey, but still...

12:14.196 --> 12:16.599
Oh, stop it. Does it matter?
It's your first Broadway show.

12:16.600 --> 12:17.539
You'll never forget it.

12:17.640 --> 12:20.275
I was 17, I was a dancing spoon.

12:20.276 --> 12:22.518
Well, the casting director
said it's the recommendation

12:22.519 --> 12:25.275
you gave me that really
put me over the top,

12:25.276 --> 12:27.313
so thank you for everything.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.275
I'm so proud of you, Benjie.

12:29.276 --> 12:30.322
Thank you. I should go.

12:30.323 --> 12:32.355
I have to get fitted for my monkey legs.

12:34.000 --> 12:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:47.326 --> 12:50.313
You had enough time, so who is it?

12:50.314 --> 12:51.722
You can't rush the casting process.

12:51.723 --> 12:53.321
My genius needs it's dream time.

12:53.322 --> 12:55.329
You guys are the Glee Club, right?

12:55.330 --> 12:57.354
Hi. I'm gonna try out.

12:57.355 --> 13:00.283
I'm a sophomore. My name is Marley.

13:00.284 --> 13:03.280
Okay, well, lots of competition,
so good luck to you.

13:07.326 --> 13:09.270
Unique offers her greetings
and salutations.

13:09.271 --> 13:10.874
Wade, you can't wear
that makeup and stuff in here.

13:10.875 --> 13:12.296
You have to understand
how this stuff works.

13:12.297 --> 13:13.316
It's like <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

13:13.317 --> 13:15.315
Yeah, the peace between us and
the truly popular kids is weak...

13:15.316 --> 13:16.312
Winter is coming.

13:16.313 --> 13:18.608
It's not gonna take much for us to get
smacked down to the bottom again.

13:18.609 --> 13:20.368
Maybe you should just save
Unique for performances

13:20.369 --> 13:23.271
and be Wade the rest of the time, hmm?

13:23.272 --> 13:27.318
All right... I'll go take off my face.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.668
- Hey, Glee people.
- Hey, Kitty.

13:32.669 --> 13:34.351
Hey, you guys see the new lunch lady?

13:34.352 --> 13:37.333
She's so fat, they took a
picture of her last Christmas.

13:37.334 --> 13:39.359
Still printing.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.271
Hey, she has to wear a watch
on both wrists,

13:42.272 --> 13:44.310
because she covers two time zones.

13:45.339 --> 13:47.291
Maybe she has, like,
a medical condition,

13:47.292 --> 13:49.339
or she swallowed somebody
with a medical condition.

13:51.699 --> 13:52.670
Right, Artie?

13:59.678 --> 14:02.666
When she sits around the house,
she really sits around the house.

14:02.667 --> 14:03.685
Attaboy.

14:03.686 --> 14:05.686
Attaboy!

14:10.624 --> 14:11.703
Hey, you ready to go?

14:11.704 --> 14:14.623
Hey. I thought that
you could wear this

14:14.624 --> 14:17.644
to your Glee audition.

14:17.645 --> 14:19.648
Well, even if they think
it's secondhand,

14:19.649 --> 14:23.648
the tag will say
high-class secondhand.

14:23.649 --> 14:25.665
It's high school.
It's all about being special.

14:25.666 --> 14:28.677
But... the right kind of special,

14:28.678 --> 14:32.652
not Goodwill clothes,

14:32.653 --> 14:34.628
daughter-of-the-lunch-lady special.

14:37.645 --> 14:40.665
You really think I have a chance
of getting into Glee Club?

14:40.666 --> 14:42.695
You have magic in your throat, Marley.

14:44.641 --> 14:46.182
It's time to share it with the world.

14:47.699 --> 14:50.640
I'm going to drive the car
a couple blocks away,

14:50.641 --> 14:53.698
and I will wait for you there.

14:53.699 --> 14:56.670
I don't want to risk anyone
seeing you get in the car with me.

15:02.636 --> 15:04.636
Mm-wah!

15:05.653 --> 15:08.440
God almighty, Schwimmer,

15:08.441 --> 15:09.720
possible you're getting worse?

15:09.721 --> 15:11.652
I've been practicing a lot.

15:11.653 --> 15:13.669
I've just had a little bit
of a rough week.

15:13.670 --> 15:16.631
Aw, you tired? You lonely?

15:16.632 --> 15:17.685
You homesick?

15:17.686 --> 15:20.652
Well, you better decide
how badly you want it,

15:20.653 --> 15:22.299
'cause this school is filled with people

15:22.300 --> 15:24.665
who will do whatever necessary
to make it in this business.

15:24.666 --> 15:25.774
Why are you picking on me?

15:25.775 --> 15:27.699
I'm not! I'm motivating you!

15:30.674 --> 15:32.665
What's your problem now?

15:32.666 --> 15:34.666
There's just alcohol on your breath.

15:39.649 --> 15:40.666
It's Listerine.

15:41.686 --> 15:44.711
Let me tell you something.

15:44.712 --> 15:48.665
I may not be a wide-eyed
ingenue anymore,

15:48.666 --> 15:51.632
but I can still dance

22:18.678 --> 22:20.632
- I did.
- You did not.

22:20.635 --> 22:24.641
I think you need to practice a little
bit more and reapply in December.

22:27.636 --> 22:28.703
Did she just get cut?

22:28.704 --> 22:30.661
It happens.

22:30.662 --> 22:32.653
Rachel Berry.

22:42.703 --> 22:44.716
Impress me.

22:50.274 --> 22:52.985
Hi. I'm Rachel Berry, and I'll be
singing "New York State of Mind,"

22:53.050 --> 22:54.003
written by Billy Joel.

22:54.004 --> 22:55.415

25:59.439 --> 26:01.442
Thank you. Thank you.

26:01.443 --> 26:02.871
Wow.

26:02.872 --> 26:04.420
Now, that's what I call star quality.

26:04.421 --> 26:05.427
What do you guys think?

26:05.428 --> 26:07.393
- Ten.
- It was good.

27:22.439 --> 27:24.426
What's this?

27:24.427 --> 27:26.434
I'm organizing all the sheet music.

27:26.435 --> 27:27.821
Artie, go around it, not over it.

27:27.822 --> 27:29.646
Thanks, Dottie.
You're dismissed for the day.

27:29.647 --> 27:31.425
This is for you...
and no, it's not a bribe,

27:31.426 --> 27:35.367
because we all know Rachel told me
herself that I'm the new Rachel.

27:35.368 --> 27:36.448
MVP in the house.

27:36.449 --> 27:39.359
Bro, I thought we agreed you'd
only wear that stuff onstage.

27:39.360 --> 27:40.508
What's wrong with you guys?

27:40.509 --> 27:42.398
This club is about diversity
and acceptance.

27:42.399 --> 27:44.426
Or at least it used to be.

27:44.427 --> 27:46.406
And another thing...
since when did everyone

27:46.407 --> 27:48.426
become so obsessed with
who's the biggest star?

27:48.427 --> 27:51.810
Since day one... you and Rachel
fought over solos for three years.

27:51.811 --> 27:54.359
No more stalling, Artie.

27:54.360 --> 27:55.360
Who's the new Rachel?

27:56.368 --> 27:57.421
Tell us.

27:57.422 --> 28:00.447
After meticulous deliberation
and an online poll,

28:00.448 --> 28:03.413
the new Rachel
is... Blaine.

28:03.414 --> 28:06.410
- How?
- Brittany, you were a close second.

28:06.413 --> 28:07.124
I came in third?

28:07.125 --> 28:08.935
Let's not worry about
third or fourth place.

28:08.936 --> 28:10.714
And we don't need
to talk about this, either.

28:10.715 --> 28:12.334
Why do you hate
strong black women for?

28:12.435 --> 28:14.375
Guys, this young lady
gave hands-down

28:14.376 --> 28:16.362
one of the best auditions
I have ever seen.

28:16.363 --> 28:18.863
Let's give it up for our
newest member, Marley Rose.

28:19.443 --> 28:23.413
Marley, on behalf of all
of New Directions!, welcome.

28:23.414 --> 28:24.426
Thank you.

28:24.427 --> 28:26.388
I'm really excited to be here.

28:26.389 --> 28:28.409
I really like your sweater.
Where'd you get it?

28:28.410 --> 28:29.447
Oh. Thanks.

28:29.448 --> 28:32.380
Um, J.Crew.

28:32.381 --> 28:33.421
Really?

28:33.422 --> 28:34.443
<i>The only new member</i>

28:34.444 --> 28:36.426
out of all those people?

28:36.427 --> 28:38.421
It wasn't that many.

28:38.422 --> 28:41.401
Okay, it was awesome!

28:41.402 --> 28:43.447
Hearing them cheer for me, accept me.

28:43.448 --> 28:45.412
And that Rachel Berry
everybody talks about

28:45.413 --> 28:47.400
rode that Glee club train
right to Broadway.

28:47.401 --> 28:49.170
Well, I don't want to be
on Broadway, though.

28:49.171 --> 28:50.646
I want to be a singer on the radio.

28:50.647 --> 28:52.543
Well, then let the Glee club
help you get there.

28:52.544 --> 28:54.430
For now, the important thing

28:54.431 --> 28:57.389
is you found someplace you belong.

28:59.368 --> 29:00.431
There's one problem.

29:03.410 --> 29:05.418
They were making fun of you.

29:07.406 --> 29:09.392
Well, they're teenagers.

29:09.393 --> 29:11.434
Just feels so weird lying about you.

29:11.435 --> 29:13.384
You're my mom.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.384
You remember what happened
at the last school?

29:15.385 --> 29:17.434
You didn't have any friends.

29:17.435 --> 29:19.388
I won't let that happen again.

29:19.389 --> 29:20.416
This is your shot to sit

29:20.417 --> 29:21.552
at the popular kids' table.

29:21.553 --> 29:23.427
Don't blow it.

29:27.406 --> 29:30.371
Of course, I think you
should be the lead soloist.

29:30.372 --> 29:32.371
But can I give you some advice?

29:32.372 --> 29:34.421
Even when Rachel was
her most controlling,

29:34.422 --> 29:37.405
she still made sure
everyone felt included.

29:37.406 --> 29:40.392
Okay. You have a point.

29:40.393 --> 29:42.363
Can I give you some advice?

29:42.364 --> 29:45.413
You can't be here anymore, Kurt.

29:45.414 --> 29:48.392
I get it. I know.
I'm pathetic.

29:48.393 --> 29:50.381
No, no, you're...
you're not pathetic.

29:50.382 --> 29:52.451
It's just that you're...
you're stuck.

29:52.452 --> 29:55.426
You don't belong here anymore.
You belong in New York.

29:55.427 --> 29:57.421
And I'm reapplying for NYADA.

29:57.422 --> 29:59.405
But I can't just go to New York.

29:59.406 --> 30:01.401
You don't need NYADA.

30:01.402 --> 30:03.166
And believe me,
I don't want to see you go,

30:03.167 --> 30:04.939
but I just can't stand
to see you stay here.

30:04.940 --> 30:06.367
It's killing you.

30:06.368 --> 30:07.422
And that's killing me.

30:07.423 --> 30:09.401
What about us?

30:09.402 --> 30:11.417
In a year, I'll be there, too, but...

30:11.418 --> 30:14.421

Brittany, I'm sorry, but I won
fair and square. You can't

32:33.436 --> 32:35.721
just decide not to sing anymore.
We all need your voice.

32:35.722 --> 32:38.262
I had a song in my heart,
Blaine Warbler, and you killed it.

32:38.263 --> 32:40.308
Now I have a dead song in my heart,
and pretty soon,

32:40.309 --> 32:42.789
the corpse of my dead heart song
is going to start to smell.

32:42.790 --> 32:43.372
Okay, guys.

32:43.375 --> 32:46.197
Since we can't do a popularity
homecoming float with all white people,

32:46.198 --> 32:48.601
I say I think we should do one
with all white chrysanthemums.

32:48.602 --> 32:50.443
That's a good idea.

32:50.446 --> 32:53.372
We need a float,
why don't we all just ride her?

32:54.385 --> 32:56.392
Look at her boobs.

32:56.393 --> 32:58.397
It's like two grocery bags full of soup.

32:58.398 --> 33:00.439
- That's really mean.
- Excuse me?

33:00.442 --> 33:01.892
You don't know her.

33:01.893 --> 33:03.416
You don't know what her life is like.

33:03.417 --> 33:04.448
So? Why do you care?

33:04.449 --> 33:06.431
Because she's my mom.

33:10.398 --> 33:13.377
I thought you guys were different.

33:21.406 --> 33:24.384
That your boyfriend?

33:24.385 --> 33:25.405
Hey.

33:25.406 --> 33:26.431
Yeah, this is Finn.

33:26.432 --> 33:29.435
He's in the Army, so we really
haven't been talking much lately.

33:29.436 --> 33:33.384
I had a girlfriend back home
when I first started NYADA.

33:33.385 --> 33:36.363
Yeah, we lasted six weeks.

33:36.364 --> 33:37.812
No, that's not gonna happen to us.

33:37.813 --> 33:39.391
I'm not gonna turn my back on him.

33:39.392 --> 33:40.522
Oh, nobody said you should.

33:40.523 --> 33:46.371
Anyway, I came to tell you
that you killed it in Tibideaux's class.

33:46.372 --> 33:47.384
Nice job.

33:47.385 --> 33:48.384
Thank you.

33:48.385 --> 33:51.435
You know, it's just, other than
when I was singing that song,

33:51.436 --> 33:57.421
I've just really never felt as
amazingly wrong as I do here.

33:57.422 --> 34:00.392
Just all alone.

34:00.393 --> 34:03.398
Kind of feel like I'm just
gonna throw up all the time.

34:04.439 --> 34:07.798
Well, it's just because you're
becoming a different person.

34:07.799 --> 34:09.388
That's why you came to New York.

34:09.389 --> 34:13.405
To be that new and improved girl.

34:13.406 --> 34:15.376
Here, let me see your phone.

34:15.377 --> 34:16.527
We're gonna take a picture.

34:20.393 --> 34:22.376
Let me see.

34:22.377 --> 34:23.447
You look good.

34:23.447 --> 34:26.376
Don't fight the new you.

34:26.377 --> 34:29.376
Because from what I've seen,

34:29.377 --> 34:32.388
she is gonna kick some serious tail.

34:32.389 --> 34:36.371
And start adding
new memories to the old ones.

34:38.447 --> 34:40.398
Walk you to class?

34:43.435 --> 34:44.547
What's the problem, people?

34:44.549 --> 34:46.388
You've been here a week.

34:46.389 --> 34:47.726
You should be dancing at, like,

34:47.728 --> 34:50.391
<i>Black Swan </i> levels
of psychosis right now.

34:50.393 --> 34:52.400
You, Miss Schwimmer.

34:52.402 --> 34:54.406
Show me your piqué.

34:56.406 --> 34:58.392
Okay, give me another one.

34:58.393 --> 35:00.393
Center yourself this time.

35:03.443 --> 35:05.455
Better, slightly.

35:05.456 --> 35:08.371
You gonna roll your eyes at me now?

35:08.372 --> 35:10.363
No.

35:10.364 --> 35:14.392
And I'm gonna keep getting better
till I'm the best you've ever seen.

35:14.393 --> 35:16.371
Oh, you're mouthy.

35:16.372 --> 35:17.443
And you got guts.

35:17.444 --> 35:19.417
Good, I like it.

35:19.418 --> 35:22.413
I like that spirit in my students.

35:22.414 --> 35:24.442
'Cause it'll make it more fun for me

35:24.443 --> 35:28.393
when I'm making your every
waking moment a hell on earth.

35:32.945 --> 35:34.020
So boring.

35:39.567 --> 35:42.395
All right.

35:42.399 --> 35:43.898
As soon as you find a place to live,

35:43.928 --> 35:45.809
I'll ship you the rest of your stuff.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.778
And you'll get enough cash
from selling your car

35:47.804 --> 35:50.156
to get you through at least
two weeks in a motel.

35:50.157 --> 35:53.156
And the emergency credit
card, which is only for what?

35:53.157 --> 35:55.056
Emergencies.
Dad, this is silly.

35:55.057 --> 35:57.143
I don't have to be in New York
to reapply for NYADA.

35:57.144 --> 35:59.024
So I can find a job
that pays me the same amount

35:59.025 --> 36:01.148
as Lima Bean, but pay
ten times more in rent?

36:01.149 --> 36:03.156
Yeah, because it's an adventure.

36:03.157 --> 36:06.202
Look, all great artists need a
little struggle in their lives.

36:06.203 --> 36:08.166
Didn't you tell me that Julia Roberts

36:08.167 --> 36:10.181
sold shoes in New York
before she made it?

36:10.182 --> 36:13.182
Good enough for Pretty Woman,
good enough for Kurt Hummel.

36:16.149 --> 36:17.156
Scared?

36:17.157 --> 36:18.210
Terrified.

36:18.211 --> 36:21.181
New York is gonna be a
breeze compared to Lima.

36:21.182 --> 36:25.148
Think about all the crap you've been
putting up with the last couple years.

36:25.149 --> 36:27.424
You know the difference between
this place and New York?

36:27.425 --> 36:29.148
Decent bagels?

36:29.149 --> 36:31.145
New York is filled
with people like you.

36:31.146 --> 36:34.185
People who aren't
afraid to be different.

36:34.186 --> 36:37.178
You're gonna feel at home there.

36:39.178 --> 36:40.251
If you're not scared,

36:40.252 --> 36:42.518
just means you're not sticking
out your neck far enough.

36:42.519 --> 36:44.168
You truly are
the world's greatest dad.

36:44.169 --> 36:47.199
I know. It's written on the coffee
mug you got me for Father's Day.

36:47.200 --> 36:49.131
Now, get out of here.

36:49.132 --> 36:50.411
You're gonna miss your flight.

36:58.199 --> 37:00.223
I'm gonna miss you, Dad.

37:00.224 --> 37:03.145
You can always come back.

37:08.216 --> 37:10.207
But you won't.

37:13.211 --> 37:16.127
I love you.

37:16.128 --> 37:18.190
I love you, too, Kurt.

37:37.182 --> 37:41.224
Hey, Marley, just wanted to apologize
for all of us and beg you not to quit.

37:41.225 --> 37:43.765
Look, I get you.

37:43.766 --> 37:46.199
Like, for instance, I know that
that sweater is from Walmart

37:46.200 --> 37:47.970
and your mom sewed the
J.Crew label into it.

37:47.971 --> 37:49.140
How do you know that?

37:49.141 --> 37:51.136
Because my mom used to do
the same thing for me.

37:51.137 --> 37:54.203
The best thing about Glee Club
is it's not about labels.

37:54.204 --> 37:56.203
If you can sing, if you can dance,

37:56.204 --> 37:58.223
you belong.

37:58.224 --> 37:59.224
And, dude, you can sing.

37:59.225 --> 38:02.127
I don't know.
You say that,

38:02.128 --> 38:04.185
but the way you were
making fun of my mom,

38:04.186 --> 38:06.185
something doesn't feel right.

38:06.186 --> 38:08.210
We came to apologize.

38:08.211 --> 38:11.134
I think being popular
felt a little too good,

38:11.135 --> 38:12.172
and we forgot ourselves.

38:12.173 --> 38:14.034
Well, I didn't.
I was always popular,

38:14.035 --> 38:16.147
but I do forget to wear
underwear sometimes, though.

38:16.148 --> 38:19.168
The best part about Glee Club is
that everyone gets to be a star.

38:19.169 --> 38:20.930
Which is why we're all
hoping that you could

38:20.931 --> 38:22.564
come to rehearsal
with us this afternoon,

38:22.565 --> 38:25.172
and maybe sing lead vocal on one
of the songs we're working on.

38:25.173 --> 38:26.495
And if words don't convince you,

38:26.496 --> 38:30.128
let the majesty and mystery of
Unique's <i>fabulousness </i> be enough!

38:31.136 --> 38:32.173
I mean it.

38:32.174 --> 38:33.324
Glee Club's a special place.

38:33.325 --> 38:36.006
I mean, where else
could I dress like this,

38:35.207 --> 38:37.344
and be welcomed with open arms?

38:38.145 --> 38:39.222
Okay, one last thing.

38:39.223 --> 38:41.703
I don't think I'm comfortable
sitting with that cheerleader

38:41.704 --> 38:44.139
and those guys at lunch.

38:44.140 --> 38:45.151
That won't be a problem.

38:45.152 --> 38:47.931
We could handle Gimpy and the
Tarantula Head and Richie Poor,

38:47.932 --> 38:50.426
because you guys were
national champs like us,

38:50.487 --> 38:53.189
but our invitation was not
extended to pre-op Precious

38:53.190 --> 38:55.182
based on the novel <i>Barf </i> by Sapphire

38:55.183 --> 38:58.148
and Mike and Molly's daughter
as part of our crew.

38:58.149 --> 39:01.127
Well, I guess we're not
in your crew anymore.

39:01.128 --> 39:03.199
You know, I was kind of hoping
you'd say that.

39:06.161 --> 39:08.216
And with that, order is restored.

39:11.186 --> 39:15.136
Well, looks like you guys have been
officially welcomed to the Glee Club.

39:15.137 --> 39:17.210
Unique's eyes...
they are on <i>fire!</i>

39:17.211 --> 39:19.216
Let's get you guys cleaned up
and go to rehearsal.

39:27.157 --> 39:28.211
You wanted to see me?

39:28.212 --> 39:31.195
Yes, I wanted to talk to
you about your audition.

39:31.196 --> 39:34.169
Do you have any idea
how hard I worked on that song?

39:34.170 --> 39:36.169
I was up for three nights
getting it right,

39:36.170 --> 39:37.726
and you didn't even let me finish.

39:37.727 --> 39:39.724
Glee Club performs
in front of hundreds of people.

39:39.725 --> 39:41.165
Some of them might boo you.

39:41.166 --> 39:43.145
You gonna throw a mic stand at them?

39:43.146 --> 39:44.148
So I'm angry.

39:44.149 --> 39:45.193
I got a right to be.

39:45.194 --> 39:46.216
You don't know me.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.135
You don't know my life.

39:48.136 --> 39:49.249
I know your brother, Jake.

39:50.132 --> 39:50.720
Puckerman.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.219
Half-brother.

39:52.220 --> 39:54.131
Our dad's like an NBA player.

39:54.132 --> 39:57.139
There could be 50 other
Puckermans running around Ohio.

39:57.140 --> 39:59.326
No one ever mentioned
anything about having a brother.

39:59.327 --> 40:00.153
He doesn't know.

40:00.154 --> 40:01.223
I get it.

40:01.224 --> 40:03.180
Now that you know
I'm related to your boy,

40:03.181 --> 40:04.724
I'm good enough for your stupid club?

40:04.725 --> 40:08.131
No. When I saw you
were related to him,

40:08.132 --> 40:11.148
I realized how much good
Glee Club did him.

40:11.149 --> 40:13.160
Made me want to take a chance on you.

40:13.161 --> 40:16.139
But you've got to get
that chip off your shoulder.

40:16.140 --> 40:18.020
And I interrupted
your audition because I knew

40:18.021 --> 40:21.215
after the first verse
that I wanted you in this club.

40:21.216 --> 40:23.152
You're really good, Jake.

40:23.153 --> 40:25.210
You think I'm good?

40:25.211 --> 40:26.219
Yeah.

40:26.220 --> 40:29.160
No.

40:29.161 --> 40:31.131
I'm not changing.

40:31.132 --> 40:34.203
I like this chip on my shoulder and
I'm not losing it to sing for you.

40:35.224 --> 40:39.140
