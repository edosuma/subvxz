WEBVTT

00:01.230 --> 00:02.527
Previously on SEAL Team...

00:02.570 --> 00:04.788
Nate was hiding a burner
phone from his wife.

00:04.830 --> 00:06.058
The address we found
in Nate's truck,

00:06.100 --> 00:07.658
You already went, didn't you?

00:07.700 --> 00:09.304
I mean, it's not like Nate was
the first teammate we had

00:09.340 --> 00:10.739
to get some on the side.

00:10.770 --> 00:12.101
This only proves that he
wasn't the exception.

00:12.140 --> 00:13.732
What the hell were you doing,
Nate?

00:13.780 --> 00:14.530
I just need to worry
about the mission,

00:14.580 --> 00:16.673
guys to my left,
guys to my right.

00:16.710 --> 00:18.268
Do that, there's not
a SEAL alive

00:18.310 --> 00:19.709
who wouldn't want
to roll with you.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.069
JUMP MASTER:
Second stick going up.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.041
FINN (over radio):
Bandit 1, five canopies,

00:22.090 --> 00:23.443
looking for a sixth.

00:23.490 --> 00:24.718
Negative contact.

00:24.750 --> 00:27.787
PILOT (over radio): Jumper in
distress. Failing to 3,000 feet.

00:27.820 --> 00:30.618
Jumper appeared to impact ground
at speed.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.591
(goats bleating,
goatherd trilling)

00:41.140 --> 00:42.732
(horn honks)

00:44.740 --> 00:47.072
(trilling)

01:37.730 --> 01:41.188
ADAM:
It's not often we have
to have this conversation.

01:41.230 --> 01:43.721
Thank God.
Not like this, anyway.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.328
We'll be holding a service

01:45.370 --> 01:47.588
soon as we're done notifying
Brian's next of kin.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.232
Even though the death
wasn't in combat,

01:49.270 --> 01:50.567
we're still going in person.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.703
Frogman to family. Only right.

01:52.740 --> 01:55.504
That kid does two tours
in Trashcanistan.

01:55.540 --> 01:57.440
Not a damn scratch.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.846
Then he burns
in a faulty 'chute.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.518
Them the breaks.

02:01.550 --> 02:02.847
You see Spenser?

02:02.890 --> 02:04.812
ADAM: That doesn't make this
any less of a tragedy.

02:04.850 --> 02:07.353
Brian's los_s hits
our community hard.

02:07.390 --> 02:09.358
Apparently, he was real tight
with the Armstrong kid.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.823
Part of his education.

02:10.860 --> 02:13.420
That's cold, brother,
even for you.
No, it's not.

02:13.460 --> 02:16.327
If this kid falls apart
every time he loses a buddy,

02:16.370 --> 02:17.894
he's in the wrong
line of work.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.830
ADAM:
Damn good operator.

02:19.870 --> 02:21.360
He'll be missed.
Tell you what.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.868
Let's just wait till he
loses a buddy in combat

02:23.910 --> 02:25.161
and see how he
handles that.

02:25.210 --> 02:28.304
Amen.

02:40.890 --> 02:41.709
Spensen

02:41.760 --> 02:43.489
Yeah.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.327
Brian's parents
live in Lamont, California.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.624
Yeah. Yeah, he said something
about outside of Bakersfield.

02:47.660 --> 02:48.854
We're flying out.

02:48.900 --> 02:50.868
(scoff)
I'm sorry, what?

02:50.900 --> 02:52.697
You're Brian's authorized
representative

02:52.740 --> 02:53.866
to notify his next of kin.

02:53.900 --> 02:56.903
Ah, man. Must...

02:56.940 --> 02:59.477
Look, Brian, he-he never said
anything to me about it.
Doesn't matter.

02:59.510 --> 03:01.603
Brian specified you
on his CACO form.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.779
Why don't you pack an
overnight bag? Ciwies.

03:03.810 --> 03:05.346
He specified that.

03:05.380 --> 03:07.871
Wheels up at 0900.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.547
(helicopter blades whirring)

03:11.720 --> 03:12.948
ERIC:
All right, listen up.

03:12.990 --> 03:14.787
Captain Garcia from JSOC's

03:14.820 --> 03:18.620
gonna read us in on the op that
he's been building. Captain.

03:18.660 --> 03:20.594
GARCIA: We're looking at
architectural drawings

03:20.630 --> 03:21.949
of a residential bunker

03:22.000 --> 03:23.729
designed by the same firm
in Germany

03:23.770 --> 03:25.897
used to build 'em for Saddam.

03:25.930 --> 03:27.830
As you can see, the plans call

03:27.870 --> 03:29.861
for four barracks-style
guardrooms

03:29.910 --> 03:31.730
between two sets of blast doors.

03:31.770 --> 03:33.829
Behind the second door,
there's a utility closet

03:33.880 --> 03:35.802
and a small living area.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.909
Now, what do you think
I'd get a mortgage for

03:36.950 --> 03:37.905
on a place like that right now?

03:37.950 --> 03:39.577
(chuckles)

03:40.880 --> 03:42.017
Ballpark.

03:42.050 --> 03:45.588
This happy fella
is Faraz Jelani.

03:45.620 --> 03:46.985
He's a Yemeni fixer.

03:47.020 --> 03:49.011
A source tell us he's the one
commISSIoned the plans.

03:49.060 --> 03:51.255
Wouldn't tell the Germans
where he was planning to burld.

03:51.290 --> 03:53.758
Look, a guy works as a
fixer in that neighborhood,

03:53.800 --> 03:54.892
of course he's gonna
have a fortress, right?

03:54.930 --> 03:57.819
We don't think he was building
the place for himself.

03:57.870 --> 03:59.667
And we don't believe
it's in Yemen, either.

04:01.740 --> 04:04.265
Oh.
GARCIA: I suppose I don't need
to tell you who that is.

04:04.310 --> 04:07.632
Hold on. You're saying
you found Abu Hassan?

04:07.680 --> 04:09.500
We recently managed to place
a tracking device

04:09.550 --> 04:11.848
on a vehicle belonging
to one of Hassan's couriers.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.019
We followed
that vehicle...

04:14.050 --> 04:15.938
to this location.

04:15.980 --> 04:17.379
MANDY: You're looking
at a limestone

04:17.420 --> 04:19.684
ridge in the Asir Mountains,

04:19.720 --> 04:23.486
about 50 miles northeast
of Abha, in Saudi Arabia.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.555
We believe these shapes
correspond

04:25.590 --> 04:27.922
to the guard emplacements
on the architectural plan.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.758
And that would mean
that this line

04:30.800 --> 04:32.893
would be the ramp down to
the exterior blast doors.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.659
Wait a second. We're gonna make
a hit inside Saudi Arabia.

04:35.700 --> 04:39.067
Same Saudi Arabia that--
I'm sorry, that supplies

04:39.110 --> 04:42.807
more than half of the oil that
we import from the Persian Gulf.

04:42.850 --> 04:43.999
RAY: Is there any chance
you're gonna tell us

04:44.050 --> 04:45.608
that the Saudis
are on-on board,

04:45.650 --> 04:47.311
th-they're gonna help
us with the snatch?

04:47.350 --> 04:48.772
Decision's been made
not to Include

04:48.820 --> 04:50.048
_our_Saudi all_ies
In this operation.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.513
Well, they're not gonna be
our allies for long.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.879
You sure they're protecting him?

04:53.920 --> 04:56.787
Not sure, but we can't
assume they aren't.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.479
GARCIA:
Needless to say,

04:58.530 --> 05:01.920
the diplomatic and economic
considerations are considerable.

05:01.960 --> 05:03.860
But Hassan was
Khalid Sheik Mohammed's

05:03.900 --> 05:04.969
senior operational commander.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.560
And he's still directing
al-Qaeda operations in Yemen.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.398
Makes him the biggest fish we've
gone after since bin Laden,

05:10.440 --> 05:12.431
and now, we believe we know
where he is.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.698
But to get DOD approval,
we need to demonstrate

05:14.740 --> 05:17.971
an assault plan that doesn't
risk a geopolitical catastrophe.

05:18.010 --> 05:19.511
I'm sorry, we're gonna
"demonstrate"?

05:19.550 --> 05:20.869
We built a full-size replica

05:20.920 --> 05:22.581
of the bunker inside
a secure hangar.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.781
Brass are inbound, as we speak,
to view our rehearsal,

05:24.820 --> 05:26.412
soon as you all are up to speed.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.950
This replica's already
been built?

05:27.990 --> 05:30.356
We spend the last few days
developing our assault plan.

05:30.390 --> 05:31.721
SONNY: Okay, pump
the brakes here.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.524
Who the hell has been designing
our assault plan?

05:37.870 --> 05:38.928
Keith, is
Senior Chief Fuller there?

05:38.970 --> 05:41.734
KEITH (on intercom): Yes, sir.
Standing right here.

05:41.770 --> 05:42.998
GARCIA: Perfect.
We're ready for him.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.804
I assume you all know
Beau Fuller?
Gentlemen.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.979
GARCIA:
Your Charlie Team leader.
Ladies.

05:48.010 --> 05:49.079
Last week, while
you were in Africa,

05:49.110 --> 05:50.247
we got Charlie Team
up and running.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.373
Chief Fuller's gonna be running
you through our operation

05:52.420 --> 05:53.717
as soon as our guests arrive.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.377
I'm sorry. Is that
our plan or your plan?

05:55.420 --> 05:57.615
Because if we were involved
In this whole process,

05:57.650 --> 05:59.652
first thing we would do,
we'd get an intel brief,

05:59.690 --> 06:01.783
then we would all
put our heads together...

06:01.820 --> 06:03.048
GARCIA: Afraid there's
no time for that.
There's no time for that.

06:03.090 --> 06:04.523
I'm confident
Chief Fuller's plan

06:04.560 --> 06:05.925
will get us our green light.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.552
Thank you, sir. I'd say
we've got a real shot,

06:07.600 --> 06:09.989
assuming you fellas
are able to keep up.

06:10.030 --> 06:13.158
(chuckles)
Wow. Garcia has a comedian
here, ladies and gentlemen.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.088
Gentlemen, I'm not gonna
mince words.

06:15.140 --> 06:17.631
This has the potential to be

06:17.670 --> 06:19.069
the defining op of our lives.

06:19.110 --> 06:20.975
This is the one you'll tell
your grandkids about.

06:21.010 --> 06:24.047
Bottom line, I simply
cannot stress enough

06:24.080 --> 06:26.913
the importance of
getting this one right.

06:26.950 --> 06:28.815
Get your game faces on.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.622
This is General Tinsdale
from CENTCOM.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.525
Ms. Burgess from State.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.460
We want this op green-lit,

06:43.500 --> 06:45.092
these are the people
we need to convince.

06:45.130 --> 06:48.497
Now, as with all
multi-team operations,

06:48.540 --> 06:51.805
cooperation and communication
will be essential.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.809
Now, as you can see,
the exterior blast doors

06:54.840 --> 06:56.899
are only approachable
via the kill zone,

06:56.950 --> 06:58.599
right between the two
guard positions.

06:58.650 --> 07:03.019
The door, 4,000 pounds
of solid, reinforced steel.

07:03.050 --> 07:06.019
Far as what we can expect
to find behind that door,

07:06.050 --> 07:07.210
I'm gonna turn it over
to Ms. Ellis.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.455
Hassan's bodyguard force
consists

07:09.490 --> 07:11.754
of a dozen or so
of his most loyal fighters.

07:11.790 --> 07:13.849
These appear to be
their living quarters,

07:13.900 --> 07:16.494
past which, we come to
an interior blast door.

07:16.530 --> 07:19.590
On the other side of that
should be our target,

07:19.640 --> 07:21.596
Abu Hassan al-Qatal.

07:21.640 --> 07:22.538
Chief Fuller will
now run us through

07:22.570 --> 07:24.538
our current thinking
for the infil. Chief.

07:24.570 --> 07:26.128
Thank you, sir.

07:26.170 --> 07:27.808
We're looking at
a direct helo assault.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.979
Quick and dirty
land right on the "X."

07:30.010 --> 07:32.205
25 yards from the blast door.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.774
What we lose in surprise,
we make up for

07:33.820 --> 07:35.242
in speed and violence
of action.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.417
RAY: Look, uh,
listen, seriously.

07:36.450 --> 07:38.589
No offense, but we-we're not
talking Afghanistan here,

07:38.620 --> 07:39.712
we're talking
Saudi Air Defense.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.580
What's the alternative?

07:41.620 --> 07:43.759
A low vis drive in, drive out?
It'd be a lot quieter.

07:43.790 --> 07:45.519
BEAU: Yeah,
more rislq.

07:45.560 --> 07:46.857
Look, we have to assume
we'll be compromised

07:46.900 --> 07:48.595
as soon as we hit
the guards, anyway.

07:48.630 --> 07:50.928
At most, the helo gives
the Saudis another, what,

07:50.970 --> 07:53.268
90 seconds
more warning?

07:53.300 --> 07:54.767
Mandy, nearest Saudi
force, how close?

07:54.800 --> 07:55.767
Oh, here.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.007
Eight klicks east of the target,

07:58.040 --> 08:00.508
special police battalion
in Tabab.

08:00.540 --> 08:03.077
We estimate the minimum response
time is 14 minutes.

08:03.110 --> 08:05.203
Chief Fuller. I
trust you understand

08:05.250 --> 08:06.672
that we cannot_
engage the Saudis

08:06.720 --> 08:08.574
under any circumstances.
Oh, yes, ma'am.

08:08.620 --> 08:10.815
We are aware, but we feel
comfortable with that margin.

08:10.850 --> 08:13.057
Some of us do.

08:13.090 --> 08:14.819
SONNY: If we
engage the Saudis,

08:14.860 --> 08:16.657
it's gonna get ugly real quick.

08:16.690 --> 08:17.622
Again,

08:17.660 --> 08:20.549
under no circumstances
can we cause damage

08:20.600 --> 08:22.795
or injury to any local forces.

08:22.830 --> 08:25.219
Bottom line, however we do this,
we got to be gone 14 minutes

08:25.270 --> 08:27.261
after our friends in Tabab
get the call.

08:27.300 --> 08:29.609
Furthe_r demonstrate
our actions on target,

08:29.640 --> 08:31.608
I suggest we move
to the full-size mock.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.198
I'll have some refreshments
brought down.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.878
If you'll please follow me.
Showtime.

08:34.910 --> 08:36.002
WOMAN:
Mmm, refreshments.

08:38.710 --> 08:40.746
Yeah, so I never knew you
to buck for rank.

08:40.780 --> 08:41.849
That what I'm doing?

08:41.880 --> 08:43.711
Oh, come on. I know you know
how many team leaders

08:43.750 --> 08:45.183
there are for every
troop chief slot.

08:45.220 --> 08:46.653
Preacher's getting close
to retirement,

08:46.690 --> 08:47.884
you want to take his place.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.057
Figure it's not a bad idea

08:49.090 --> 08:51.285
to show up the competition
in front of Command, right?

08:51.330 --> 08:52.592
Wow, you know what?

08:52.630 --> 08:54.598
That never crossed my mind.
Yeah.

08:54.630 --> 08:56.666
That's what-- well, there's
a difference between me and you.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.258
Oh, that's just one of many.
Yeah.

08:58.300 --> 08:59.164
I guess so.

09:01.670 --> 09:03.160
You want to tell me
what that was about?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.735
History, man.
A lot of history.

09:05.770 --> 09:07.101
Want to
catch me up?

09:07.140 --> 09:09.176
On Beau and Jason?
Yeah.

09:09.210 --> 09:10.768
They went through
Green Team together.

09:10.810 --> 09:12.175
And Jason made
team leader first.

09:12.210 --> 09:13.142
So much for
the brotherhood.

09:13.180 --> 09:15.171
Come on, now, who fights
more than brothers?

09:15.220 --> 09:16.346
Plus,

09:16.380 --> 09:17.745
now, there's always,

09:17.790 --> 09:19.587
"How many black team leaders
does it take

09:19.620 --> 09:20.780
to screw in
a light bulb?"

09:20.820 --> 09:21.650
I'm not gonna touch that one.

09:21.690 --> 09:23.089
Both of them.
Ugh.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.189
I'm just saying, I'm sure
it hasn't been easy for him.

09:25.230 --> 09:26.254
I can imagine.

09:26.290 --> 09:28.099
But that does not
excuse the fact

09:28.130 --> 09:31.691
that he is
a little bit of a dick.

09:31.730 --> 09:32.992
CLAY:
You done a lot of these?

09:33.040 --> 09:34.632
ADAM:
Next-of-kin notifications?

09:34.670 --> 09:35.659
Done four.

09:35.700 --> 09:39.932
I guess I could tell you
it gets easier, but, uh...

09:39.980 --> 09:42.039
So what do you say?

09:42.080 --> 09:44.640
(car alarm chirps)
Ah, you're overthinking.

09:44.680 --> 09:47.740
There's no predicting what
a parent'll want to hear.

09:47.780 --> 09:51.841
Only thing you can do is go in,
make the best of it.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.787
"You never really know
what's behind the door

09:54.820 --> 09:55.957
until you breach it."

09:57.960 --> 10:01.919
ADAM: How much you, uh,
know about Brian's family?

10:01.960 --> 10:04.963
Just what he told me.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.231
Their dad sells insurance,
mom's a librarian.

10:08.270 --> 10:12.969
Cul-de-sac, white picket fence,
swing in the yard.

10:13.010 --> 10:14.830
I guess someone's got to
have that life.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.906
You know _
where we're g0ing?

10:18.950 --> 10:21.919
Uh, yeah, got an
address for his mom.

10:21.950 --> 10:25.044
Lucy Denise, 113 High Street.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.827
There, uh, is there any chance
you want to do all the talking?

10:35.260 --> 10:37.763
JASON:
Hope they like the show.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.267
As long as they leave some
refreshments for the rest of us.

10:39.300 --> 10:41.791
A shame we can't afford to build
one of these ahead of every hit.

10:41.840 --> 10:42.909
BEA_U:
To continue...

10:45.470 --> 10:49.770
However we infil, this is the
first door we have to breach.

10:49.810 --> 10:51.846
Once we're on target, Charlie
Team will engage both guards,

10:51.880 --> 10:53.313
then be primary to the breach.

10:53.350 --> 10:54.817
Naturally.
Bravo will

10:54.850 --> 10:56.841
hang back to provide overwatch
and, if necessary,

10:56.890 --> 10:57.845
support by fire.

10:57.890 --> 10:58.879
Wow, keeping us really safe.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.888
That's very thoughtful of you.

11:00.920 --> 11:02.410
Well, we'll try to leave
something for you.

11:02.460 --> 11:05.088
As I was saying, after
we breach and make entry,

11:05.130 --> 11:07.826
half of Bravo Team stays outside
to maintain rear security,

11:07.860 --> 11:09.896
rest of Bravo falls on Charlie
to clear the structure.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.898
So, not only is
Bravo Team split,

11:11.930 --> 11:14.262
but half of it is now
with Charlie Team?

11:14.300 --> 11:16.131
BEAU: Yeah, don't worry about
it. I'll take good care of 'em.

11:16.170 --> 11:17.364
Really? Because, you
know what, in my book,

11:17.410 --> 11:18.729
I don't think you
should split the teams.

11:18.770 --> 11:19.976
BEAU: So what? You
worried your scouts

11:20.010 --> 11:21.102
can't handle being away

11:21.140 --> 11:23.847
from their scout leader?
(chuckles): Oh. Right. Scouts.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.768
All right. Once we're
through the blast door,

11:25.810 --> 11:27.038
we move on to
the next stage

11:27.080 --> 11:29.446
of our presentation.
If you'll follow me, please.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.881
JASON:
This just keeps getting better.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.478
This is the area
where we're most likely

11:34.520 --> 11:36.078
to encounter resistance,

11:36.120 --> 11:37.428
the second blast door.

11:37.460 --> 11:38.757
We clear
this section,

11:38.790 --> 11:40.428
get set to blow
the internal blast door,

11:40.460 --> 11:41.859
we figure
we still got

11:41.900 --> 11:43.299
eight minutes to get in and out
with Hassan.

11:43.330 --> 11:46.094
Another
explosive breach?
Why not?

11:46.130 --> 11:48.098
How many noncombatants
do we have on the other
side of that door?

11:48.140 --> 11:50.836
Hassan has three wives,
six children.

11:50.870 --> 11:52.906
A couple lieutenants
have families.

11:52.940 --> 11:54.498
We have no idea

11:54.540 --> 11:56.770
what kind of security
Hassan'll have in there.

11:56.810 --> 11:58.448
I mean, could be half-dozen guys
in S-vests behind this door.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.869
I want 'em on their knees,
seeing stars
when we come through.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.217
RAY: Could also be
a bunch of kids.

12:02.250 --> 12:04.514
Or there could not be.
Rules of engagement say,
unless we see them,

12:04.550 --> 12:07.917
we have no obligation
to assume they're there.
JASON: Or there could be.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.848
I don't know about you, but
I really don't want to see

12:09.890 --> 12:11.778
half a dozen kids
dead on CNN.

12:11.830 --> 12:14.321
TINSDALE: I believe
I have a solution.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.863
See, I was concerned
about the children myself,

12:16.900 --> 12:18.390
thought
we might find a way

12:18.430 --> 12:20.933
to distract them, keep them
busy, out of harm's way.

12:20.970 --> 12:22.528
So I had my staff
pull stats

12:22.570 --> 12:25.403
on the most popular
candies in Saudi Arabia.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.204
The Galaw bar seems to be
a consistent top seller.

12:28.240 --> 12:31.801
Figure if we issue
each operator a dozen or so,

12:31.850 --> 12:34.410
you can pass 'em out whenever
you come across the children.

12:34.450 --> 12:36.077
That's good
thinking, sir.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.088
SONNY: Good-Idea Fairies drive
all the way down here from DC.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.485
to break our balls in person?

12:39.520 --> 12:41.556
No matter how popular
the candy is, sir,

12:41.590 --> 12:43.421
we're not gonna be able
to have that option till we get

12:43.460 --> 12:45.257
through that door.
Yeah, and we're not
gonna be able to get

12:45.290 --> 12:46.518
through that door
unless we blow it.

12:46.560 --> 12:47.492
No, we cut it.

12:47.530 --> 12:49.157
We don't have time
to cut it.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.827
How much time's
that gonna cost us?

12:50.870 --> 12:52.565
Let's see,
four-inch tempered steel?

12:52.600 --> 12:54.397
Take the Broco torch
two, three minutes.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.396
Doesn't seem to leave a lot
of time to get you all back out

12:56.440 --> 12:58.806
before the Saudis arrive.
Look, the torch

12:58.840 --> 13:00.808
is too slow. We got to blow it.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.068
JASON: Sir,
I'm confident my guys

13:02.110 --> 13:03.941
can make initial assault,
get to this door,

13:03.980 --> 13:06.244
have plenty of time to
burn it, secure HVT,

13:06.280 --> 13:09.511
and make exfil without
killing noncombatants

13:09.550 --> 13:10.847
on the other
side of that door.

13:10.890 --> 13:12.448
You got two minutes.

13:12.490 --> 13:14.014
We'll run it
with the torch.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.789
Let's do this.

13:19.390 --> 13:21.324
ADAM: Maybe Brian got
the address wrong.

13:21.360 --> 13:22.861
His mom's name
is Lucy Denise.

13:22.900 --> 13:25.994
Maybe she owns
the place.

13:26.030 --> 13:28.533
(indistinct chatter)

13:28.570 --> 13:30.003
Excuse me.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.304
Any chance you know somebody
called Lucy Denise?

13:33.340 --> 13:35.831
Is this some
kind of joke?

13:35.880 --> 13:37.177
Not that we know of.

13:37.210 --> 13:39.940
How-how is it a joke,
Lucy Denise?

13:39.980 --> 13:42.278
Well, place is called Lucy's.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.288
Been here going on 40 years.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.481
One of the waitresses
been here almost that long.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.488
Name's Denise.

13:48.520 --> 13:52.058
DENISE: So, that thing where
cops are required to admit

13:52.090 --> 13:53.990
who they are,
you ask 'em straight out--

13:54.030 --> 13:55.952
that's just in the movies,
right?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.423
Uh, as we said, ma'am...
Yeah, yeah.

13:58.470 --> 14:00.961
You're with the navy.
I remember.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.106
"Lucy Denise,"
huh? Well,

14:04.140 --> 14:05.437
guess that's me.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.609
Oh, unless she's
wanted for something

14:07.640 --> 14:08.937
or she owes you money.
In that case,

14:08.980 --> 14:12.040
I have never heard of her.
(chuckles)

14:12.080 --> 14:13.377
Well, you found me.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.980
So, you want to tell me now
why you're looking?

14:16.020 --> 14:17.146
Brian Armstrong.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.408
You know him?

14:19.450 --> 14:20.951
CLAY: I swear,
ma'am, we're not...

14:20.990 --> 14:23.151
we're not trying to jam
anybody up here, okay?

14:23.190 --> 14:25.329
Brian...

14:25.360 --> 14:27.021
Brian is a friend.

14:28.960 --> 14:32.225
Brian's mom used to use this
place as free baby5itting.

14:32.270 --> 14:35.364
She'd drop Brian off
whenever she was out doing...

14:35.400 --> 14:36.958
whatever it was
she was d0ing.

14:37.010 --> 14:40.434
He'd sit in a corner booth
with a stack of books.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.607
Would never drink
a soda though,

14:42.640 --> 14:45.006
no matter how many
times we offered.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.314
Strictly water or milk.

14:47.350 --> 14:49.045
Do you, uh...
do you have any idea

14:49.080 --> 14:51.082
where we might be able
to find his mom?

14:51.120 --> 14:53.611
Oh, she passed away.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.959
Brian couldn't have
been more than eight,

14:56.990 --> 14:59.584
nine. Went to live
with his dad.

14:59.630 --> 15:02.019
Use some coffee?

15:02.060 --> 15:03.368
Yeah. We both could.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.095
Long flight.

15:05.130 --> 15:06.688
Well, have a seat
over there.

15:06.730 --> 15:08.664
That's where Brian
used to sit.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.362
I'll go fetch
you some fresh.

15:19.310 --> 15:21.141
I don't get it.

15:21.180 --> 15:24.013
Said his mom came to all
of his football games.

15:26.020 --> 15:28.159
Said he talked to her
every week.

15:32.090 --> 15:34.092
*

15:36.600 --> 15:39.125
ERIC:
14-minute

15:39.170 --> 15:40.535
response time
for the Saudi cops.

15:40.570 --> 15:43.368
Clock starts as soon
as you engage the guards.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.105
The most time-consuming
portion

15:45.140 --> 15:47.574
of this op will be breaching
the two blast doors.

15:47.610 --> 15:51.171
If you fail to exfil
with Abu Hassan in 14 minutes,

15:51.210 --> 15:52.643
we'll stop the drill and reset.

15:52.680 --> 15:55.410
All right, boys,
show us what you got.

15:55.450 --> 15:57.145
I'll show you
what I got.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.043
(grunts)

15:58.090 --> 15:59.648
MAN:
Three,

15:59.690 --> 16:02.659
two, one. Execute.
(mock gunshots)

16:02.690 --> 16:04.385
(beeps, stopwatch ticking)
Okay. Sentries are down.

16:04.430 --> 16:07.149
*

16:22.410 --> 16:24.241
Fire in the hole!

16:31.350 --> 16:33.079
What in the hell was that?

16:33.120 --> 16:34.189
A breaching charge.

16:34.220 --> 16:35.209
You think it was big enough?

16:35.260 --> 16:36.215
"P" for "plenty," baby.

16:36.260 --> 16:37.386
You just turned
a two-ton door

16:37.430 --> 16:39.079
into a two-ton obstacle,
numbnuts.

16:39.130 --> 16:40.427
(arguing indistinctly)

16:40.460 --> 16:43.293
Sir, will you excuse us
a moment?

16:43.330 --> 16:45.321
Eric...
Yeah.

16:47.270 --> 16:49.033
All right, look, you know what,
I know that the book says

16:49.070 --> 16:50.537
to overpower the breach
when there's no friendlies

16:50.570 --> 16:51.730
on the other side
of the wall,

16:51.770 --> 16:54.204
but maybe we should start
thinking outside of the book.

16:54.240 --> 16:56.208
Oh, for a change.
What's that supposed to mean?

16:56.240 --> 16:58.447
The book's there to keep
everyone safe. Improvising's
how people get hurt.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.744
You know what, I'm not gonna
have to tell one of my guys'
widows that she and her kids

17:00.780 --> 17:02.748
just had her life
cored out on account

17:02.780 --> 17:05.089
of I insisted on flying
by the seat of my pants.

17:05.120 --> 17:08.681
Hey. Do I need to get in this?

17:08.720 --> 17:11.052
We're good.
Yeah, we got it.
It's nothing to worry about.

17:11.090 --> 17:12.159
ERIC:
Listen to me,

17:12.190 --> 17:13.498
all right?
This is not Green Team.

17:13.530 --> 17:16.226
We shouldn't be handling
Green Team business.

17:16.260 --> 17:19.195
Now, those people up there
are losing patience.

17:19.230 --> 17:21.266
So whatever's between
the two of you,

17:21.300 --> 17:23.507
I suggest
you let it go.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.735
I'm not gonna
tell you again.

17:32.450 --> 17:35.146
CLAY: No swing in the yard,
no white picket fence.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.683
Starting to feel
like a pattern.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.142
Yeah.

17:39.190 --> 17:40.487
WOMAN:
Don't you move!

17:40.520 --> 17:43.580
Got my 20-gauge set
straight at your spines.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.780
Pull this trigger,
both of you crap in bags

17:45.830 --> 17:47.195
the rest of
your lives.

17:47.230 --> 17:49.118
You're making a
mistake, ma'am.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.390
We're with the Naw. I'm
Master Chief Adam Seaver.

17:51.430 --> 17:53.398
This is Petty
Officer Clay Spenser.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.091
WOMAN: Oh, Navy,
huh? Turn around.

17:56.140 --> 17:59.132
Nice and slow.

18:04.910 --> 18:08.277
That's not a real good idea,
bluff having a shotgun.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.139
Not a real good idea,

18:09.180 --> 18:11.512
go snooping around
abandoned houses.

18:11.550 --> 18:14.212
Uh, you know the people
used to live here?

18:14.260 --> 18:15.352
Some of 'em.

18:15.390 --> 18:17.881
For a while, seemed like
there were new people in here

18:17.930 --> 18:19.488
every couple of months.

18:19.530 --> 18:21.157
Look, ma'am, a, um,

18:21.200 --> 18:23.293
friend of ours
gave us this address.

18:23.330 --> 18:26.788
We're-we're looking for a man
named, uh, Samuel Armstrong.

18:26.830 --> 18:29.162
Any chance
that rings a bell?
Friends of his?

18:29.200 --> 18:30.633
His son, Brian.

18:30.670 --> 18:33.776
Good. Sammy was
a son of a bitch.

18:33.810 --> 18:35.903
The boy was a
good egg, though.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.443
Used to wonder about him _
sometimes, what happened to him.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.710
He join the Navy?

18:40.750 --> 18:43.412
I hope you all can keep him
from turning into his old man.

18:43.450 --> 18:46.840
You happen to know where
Samuel went gifter he left here?
ure.

18:46.890 --> 18:48.357
Son of a bitch
finally got himself

18:48.390 --> 18:50.221
sent up to the penitentiary

18:50.260 --> 18:52.228
in Salinas.
Sahnas.

18:52.260 --> 18:54.399
He still there?
No idea.

18:54.430 --> 18:57.228
Child Services shipped the boy
off to a state home.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.589
Never heard from either
one of 'em again.

18:58.630 --> 18:59.927
Used to wonder
about him sometimes,

18:59.970 --> 19:01.460
what happened
to the boy.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.206
You, uh... you happen
to remember the name

19:03.240 --> 19:03.934
of the state home?

19:03.970 --> 19:05.335
GARCIA:
All right, sir,

19:05.370 --> 19:07.474
here we go again.

19:07.510 --> 19:09.478
*

19:12.310 --> 19:13.072
(beeps, stopwatch ticking)

19:13.110 --> 19:16.443
DAVIS: 14 minutes.
Piece of cake.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.179
*

19:40.310 --> 19:42.471
They got to be faster out there.

19:53.590 --> 19:55.581
*

20:15.510 --> 20:17.239
(groans)

20:18.950 --> 20:20.941
(mock gunshots)

20:30.690 --> 20:31.486
(horn blows)
ERIC: Time!

20:31.530 --> 20:33.395
(groaning)

20:36.300 --> 20:39.269
*

20:40.300 --> 20:42.359
(beeps, stopwatch ticking)

20:42.400 --> 20:45.267
(creaking)

20:45.310 --> 20:46.231
It's better.

20:47.810 --> 20:49.698
(mock gunshots)
(thud)

20:51.750 --> 20:53.047
(mock gunshots)
(thud)

20:53.080 --> 20:54.775
*

21:13.740 --> 21:14.934
Ready to burn.

21:18.970 --> 21:20.631
(horn blows)

21:20.680 --> 21:21.931
Time's up, fellas.

21:21.980 --> 21:24.346
(groaning, chatter)

21:24.380 --> 21:27.417
DAVIS:
They'll get it.

21:27.450 --> 21:28.519
They'll get it.

21:28.550 --> 21:31.519
(beeps, stopwatch ticking)

21:33.660 --> 21:35.981
(groans)

21:36.020 --> 21:38.682
(mock gunshots)
(grunts)

21:45.000 --> 21:46.592
(hissing)

22:03.920 --> 22:05.717
Cut. Cut it! Cut it!

22:05.750 --> 22:07.786
That's it.

22:07.820 --> 22:09.378
(whooshing, horn honks)

22:13.130 --> 22:14.552
(door creaks open)

22:14.600 --> 22:15.897
Now that's it.

22:15.930 --> 22:17.363
The op's off.
(groaning)

22:17.400 --> 22:18.594
Oh, come on.
Sir, all due respect,

22:18.630 --> 22:20.461
there's not gonna be any plywood
on the target.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.899
Or we just go
explosive...
MAN:
Right.

22:21.940 --> 22:22.964
Not doing explosives.
GARCIA:
It doesn't matter.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.103
Even before the fire,
you were about

22:24.140 --> 22:26.358
to miss another time target,
and nobody

22:26.410 --> 22:27.809
wanted to put their
name on the op

22:27.840 --> 22:29.899
that started a war with
Saudi Arabia. Bottom line--

22:29.940 --> 22:31.544
brass feels
the op's too rislq.

22:31.580 --> 22:33.616
They don't want to commit.

22:35.420 --> 22:37.980
Oh, you happy?

22:38.020 --> 22:40.488
What the hell is that _
supposed to mean, sunshine?

22:40.520 --> 22:42.454
Playing the same plan we've
had for the last few days.

22:42.490 --> 22:44.082
Then the Great
Jason Hayes appears,

22:44.130 --> 22:46.655
starts changing things up on
the fly, just like always.

22:46.690 --> 22:48.794
It's not my fault that your
plan got all jacked up.

22:48.830 --> 22:51.162
No, the only thing jacked up,
man, is your attitude.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.839
How about your ego?
You've been trying
to undermine me this whole time.

22:53.870 --> 22:55.690
This whole time!
Why have I been undermining you
this whole time?

22:55.740 --> 22:58.402
Because you have one tool
that you use for every job.

22:58.440 --> 23:00.476
That charge you would have put
on the interior of that door

23:00.510 --> 23:02.432
would have collapsed
the entire bunker.
That is your opinion!

23:02.480 --> 23:04.072
Yeah, it is also my opinion

23:04.110 --> 23:06.874
that you devised a plan that
would kill innocent people.

23:06.910 --> 23:11.017
But then again, we all know
how you feel about that.

23:11.050 --> 23:13.917
You don't_k_n_ow there are
gonna be CIVIlians on target!

23:13.960 --> 23:16.884
You don't know
that there won't be.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.080
You know what, Jay?

23:18.130 --> 23:20.189
You love to talk
about the Good-Idea Fairies.

23:20.230 --> 23:22.698
Always want to talk
about the Good-Idea Fairies,

23:22.730 --> 23:24.129
come late to an op,

23:24.170 --> 23:26.627
screw everything up
with their lame-ass ad-libs.

23:26.670 --> 23:30.162
But it never occurs to you that
you a the Good-Idea Fairy.

23:30.200 --> 23:33.203
Always trying to change
things up, do something extra,

23:33.240 --> 23:35.208
remind everyone how much better

23:35.240 --> 23:37.606
Jason Hayes is
than everybody else.

23:37.650 --> 23:40.619
Yeah, but when
somebody gets hurt,

23:40.650 --> 23:42.538
or gets killed, 'cause
you couldn't be bothered

23:42.580 --> 23:44.081
to stick to
the script?

23:44.120 --> 23:46.486
You seriously talking
about Nate right now?
"Hey, can't blame Jason Hayes

23:46.520 --> 23:49.216
for being aggressive."
(indistinct chatter)

23:49.260 --> 23:50.887
(indistinct chatter)
Break that up!

23:50.930 --> 23:52.886
Break it up. Easy, easy.

23:52.930 --> 23:53.897
JASON:
What do you got?!
Come on, Santini.

23:53.930 --> 23:55.227
Santini, come on.
Hey!

23:55.260 --> 23:56.693
Hey, relax!
Hey!

23:56.730 --> 23:58.527
You thought I was the one
with the temper.

23:58.570 --> 24:01.835
Relax. Come on,
let's go.

24:01.870 --> 24:04.065
(indistinct chatter)

24:05.910 --> 24:08.037
JASON:
You know what?
I'm not apologizing

24:08.080 --> 24:09.172
to that jackass, if that's
what you want me to do.

24:09.210 --> 24:11.246
Oh, what? Jason Hayes
apologize? Perish the thought.

24:11.280 --> 24:14.579
Yeah, perish the thought.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.508
You know, when I was
getting out of selection,

24:16.550 --> 24:18.484
Bravo Team was deciding
which candidate

24:18.520 --> 24:21.819
from my Green Team class they
were gonna pick in the draft.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.555
You remember any
of the conversations they had

24:23.590 --> 24:24.921
before deciding
it ought to be me?

24:24.960 --> 24:26.757
I don't, okay?
I was a 3IC back then.

24:26.790 --> 24:29.691
Okay. All right, well,
let me ask you something.

24:29.730 --> 24:31.163
You ever consider
the color of my skin?

24:31.200 --> 24:32.792
Come on. No,
it's not about that.

24:32.830 --> 24:34.866
It is not about that,
do you understand me?

24:34.900 --> 24:36.765
As far as I'm concerned,
jackasses come in one color.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.267
Yeah, but this particular
jackass is black.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.778
Yeah? And, so?
Look, I get it, man.

24:40.810 --> 24:42.573
I never could
stand Beau myself.

24:42.610 --> 24:44.544
All right? He's an arrogant,
uptight perfectionist

24:44.580 --> 24:45.706
with no sense of humor,

24:45.750 --> 24:47.570
and he won't think
outside the box.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.178
I get it.
He drives you crazy.

24:49.220 --> 24:50.744
Good. I'm glad
that we see the same way.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.246
Okay, well, how do you think
he's seeing you?

24:52.290 --> 24:54.508
Better question-- do I care?

24:54.560 --> 24:56.255
He's seeing a white guy
with slept-on hair,

24:56.290 --> 24:57.882
couple days' growth,
and your shirt

24:57.930 --> 24:59.249
flapping almost as
much as your mouth.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.554
Thanks for that, Ray.
Really appreciate it.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.249
Look, man, the point is,

25:03.300 --> 25:05.029
he's seeing a guy go through
life the way he wishes he could.

25:05.070 --> 25:06.298
Look, what do you even
know about this guy?

25:06.330 --> 25:10.608
I know enough! I know what it's
like starting BUD/S-- 150 guys,

25:10.640 --> 25:12.699
first day of Phase 1,
I'm the only black face.

25:12.740 --> 25:14.276
Night time surf torture,

25:14.310 --> 25:16.574
everyone laid out
side-by-side on the beach,

25:16.610 --> 25:19.602
eyes stinging, mouths tasting
like puke, salt and sand.

25:19.650 --> 25:20.810
Every time a wave comes in,

25:20.850 --> 25:22.112
everybody's trying
to cheat, right?

25:22.150 --> 25:23.310
Keep their head up

25:23.350 --> 25:24.886
so the sea_ water doesn't
go back in your nose.

25:24.920 --> 25:26.683
Instructors yelling
at you to get back down.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.688
The thing is, in the dark, Jace,

25:28.720 --> 25:32.019
it's hard to tell one white face
from another.

25:32.060 --> 25:34.119
So who do you think
they call out by name?

25:34.160 --> 25:36.128
Huh?

25:36.160 --> 25:38.299
"Perry, you get your nappy head
back down in that sand!"

25:38.330 --> 25:40.321
We chose you because
you're a great operator.

25:40.370 --> 25:43.066
No, you chose me
because I was the best operator.

25:44.710 --> 25:47.577
It's what you're not
understanding, brother.

25:47.610 --> 25:49.737
For me, for Beau,
being great's not good enough.

25:49.780 --> 25:51.805
You go outside the box,

25:51.850 --> 25:53.738
you're innovative,
a self-starter.

25:53.780 --> 25:56.578
If we do it, we can't
follow the rules.

25:56.620 --> 25:58.815
I'm not saying that excuses
the way Beau is at all.

25:58.850 --> 26:00.044
I'm just saying
it's something

26:00.090 --> 26:01.284
you ought to at least
take into account.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.789
Got it, man.
I got it, all right?

26:06.830 --> 26:08.650
Look, I appreciate
you talking to me,

26:08.700 --> 26:10.793
but did you hear
what he said about Nate?

26:10.830 --> 26:12.718
You know what? You were actually
the one who brought up Nate.
Really?

26:12.770 --> 26:15.364
Somebody gets killed 'cause
I can't stick to the script?

26:15.400 --> 26:17.061
You don't think
that's what he meant?

26:17.100 --> 26:18.328
You know what I think?
(sighs)

26:18.370 --> 26:20.804
I think Nate's death has been
eating at you for months now,

26:20.840 --> 26:22.330
and I think it's time you talked
to somebody about it

26:22.380 --> 26:23.404
'cause it's not going away.

26:23.440 --> 26:26.045
Therapy. Therapy--
yeah, that's never gonna happen.

26:26.080 --> 26:27.638
Maybe not a shrink,
necessarily.

26:29.150 --> 26:32.688
But me, Alana, somebody.

26:32.720 --> 26:35.280
That's not what we do, Ray.
Yeah?

26:37.690 --> 26:38.850
and risk getting bounced
out of command.

26:38.890 --> 26:40.653
Look, how many
friends have we lost?

26:40.700 --> 26:41.894
We never talk about them.

26:41.930 --> 26:43.693
Why is so Nate different?

26:43.730 --> 26:45.698
You know what? Honestly, I
really don't care about the why.

26:45.730 --> 26:48.392
All I care about is
figuring out how to fix it.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.739
I told Naima
we got scrapped.

26:51.770 --> 26:54.409
She's making lunch.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.408
You hungry?

26:56.440 --> 26:57.805
No. I'm good.
I'm fine.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.203
I got something
I got to do.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.616
Somewhere I need
to be, okay?

27:02.420 --> 27:04.308
I'm good.
Okay.

27:04.350 --> 27:05.908
Yeah.

27:15.030 --> 27:16.691
Hey, Pete.

27:16.730 --> 27:18.288
What's going on?

27:18.330 --> 27:19.866
Thanks for coming by, man.

27:19.900 --> 27:21.162
Well, after all
we've been through,

27:21.200 --> 27:22.394
hard to see turning
you down for a drink.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.237
Man, it's a little thick
in here, isn't it?

27:24.270 --> 27:25.760
Yeah, probably
the AC's broken.

27:25.810 --> 27:26.902
Well, you want
to go somewhere else?

27:26.940 --> 27:28.168
Hell, no. Drink in the heat.

27:28.210 --> 27:30.747
Let's pretend
we're back in Kabul.
Hey, what can I get you?

27:30.780 --> 27:33.169
Can I get a beer
and a shot of tequila? You in?

27:33.210 --> 27:35.314
Yeah, make it two.
Got it.
Okay.

27:35.350 --> 27:37.079
How long you been back
in Virginia?

27:37.120 --> 27:39.384
Oh, a couple months.

27:39.420 --> 27:41.149
Sorry about Nate.

27:41.190 --> 27:43.249
Yeah, I wanted to get back
for the funeral. I...

27:43.290 --> 27:45.952
had to stay in JBad,
finish a contract.

27:45.990 --> 27:48.197
Yeah.

27:48.230 --> 27:50.221
Um...

27:52.130 --> 27:54.234
(indistinct chatter,
pool balls clicking)

27:54.270 --> 27:55.737
Where'd you get that?

27:55.770 --> 27:57.465
Found that in Nate's burn box.

27:57.500 --> 28:00.469
What do you know
about her?

28:00.510 --> 28:03.104
Marjan. You know
that 'terp that you had,

28:03.140 --> 28:04.744
the one that disappeared?
That's his wife.

28:04.780 --> 28:07.044
Oh, yeah, I know that.

28:07.080 --> 28:09.173
Well, after her
husband disappeared,

28:09.220 --> 28:10.778
she assumed
he was picked up by the Taliban,

28:10.820 --> 28:12.185
thought she was next.

28:12.220 --> 28:14.051
Right.
Here you go.

28:14.090 --> 28:16.456
Thanks.
Enjoy.

28:17.860 --> 28:19.452
Thanks.

28:23.500 --> 28:26.264
So...

28:26.300 --> 28:29.133
she comes to you, right?

28:29.170 --> 28:32.230
And she asks you
to get her out of Afghanistan.

28:32.270 --> 28:34.204
Nate knew
I had contacts at the border.

28:34.240 --> 28:35.138
Right.

28:35.180 --> 28:36.829
How'd she get to Virginia?

28:38.450 --> 28:40.008
Bad idea, Pete.

28:40.050 --> 28:41.472
Well, what was I gonna do?
Say no?

28:41.520 --> 28:42.919
You know what I owed Nate.

28:42.950 --> 28:45.214
(sighs)

28:45.250 --> 28:46.945
Anybody else know
about her?

28:46.990 --> 28:48.355
No, just my guys.

28:48.390 --> 28:50.756
Now what are you
worried about?

28:50.790 --> 28:52.280
You think the DOD'd
go after Molly's pension?

28:52.330 --> 28:54.298
All it takes is
one cake-eater

28:54.330 --> 28:56.093
to make an example
out of somebody, man.

28:56.130 --> 28:59.497
Must be nice, you know?
Be an officer,

28:59.530 --> 29:02.067
seeing everything from 30,000
feet where it all makes sense.

29:02.100 --> 29:02.998
Never having
to be on the ground,

29:03.040 --> 29:05.804
see where people live,
how messy it gets.

29:08.980 --> 29:12.802
Right. On the ground
where people live,

29:12.850 --> 29:15.318
sweat.

29:15.350 --> 29:16.840
Especially in the desert.

29:18.890 --> 29:21.188
Thanks, Pete.

29:21.220 --> 29:23.984
Thank you all for coming
back at this late hour.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.349
On a hunch,
Jason asked me

29:25.390 --> 29:27.187
to check the thermal
imaging of the compound,

29:27.230 --> 29:28.993
and we discovered that

29:29.030 --> 29:31.169
because the German design firm
didn't know

29:31.200 --> 29:33.065
where this bunker
would be constructed,

29:33.100 --> 29:34.931
there were unable to anticipate

29:34.970 --> 29:37.131
the challenges particular
to the desert environment.

29:37.170 --> 29:40.207
The extreme heat of the location
appears to have forced Hassan

29:40.240 --> 29:42.037
to install a pair

29:42.080 --> 29:44.878
of AC ducts that
don't appear

29:44.910 --> 29:47.003
on the plans we used
to design our models.

29:47.050 --> 29:48.972
Our analysis of the imagery
suggests that

29:49.020 --> 29:50.339
two vertical ducts were drilled

29:50.380 --> 29:52.041
directly
into the limestone cliffs,

29:52.090 --> 29:55.059
and connect to horizontal
ducts in5ide the compound,

29:55.090 --> 29:57.285
and therefore,
lack the secure countermeasures

29:57.320 --> 29:59.220
of the rest
of the bunker's vent system.

29:59.260 --> 30:01.353
So, by dropping
through the air ducts,

30:01.400 --> 30:03.391
we bypass all sentries
and blast doors,

30:03.430 --> 30:05.864
arriving here
without alerting anyone

30:05.900 --> 30:07.299
to our presence.

30:07.330 --> 30:09.264
Easy to beat the clock
if it never starts.

30:09.300 --> 30:11.165
That's right.
GARCIA: How big are the ducts?

30:11.210 --> 30:12.905
MANDY: We estimate
three feet by three feet.

30:12.940 --> 30:14.532
Crawl a few hundred feet
with all that gear?

30:14.580 --> 30:17.208
It's gonna be tight.
Nobody said
it was gonna be easy.

30:17.240 --> 30:18.275
TINSDALE:
What about the exfil?

30:18.310 --> 30:20.141
I hope you're not planning
to climb back up that rope

30:20.180 --> 30:21.078
with your prisoner.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.918
Well, once we secure
the package inside,

30:23.950 --> 30:25.315
we_ will communicate
With Charlie Team,

30:25.350 --> 30:28.148
they will clear inward
as we clear outward.

30:28.190 --> 30:30.886
We'll open the interior
blast door and exfil together.

30:30.930 --> 30:31.589
Chief Fuller,

30:31.630 --> 30:33.518
any objections?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.389
Well, that's damn right
it ain't gonna be easy.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.431
But at least this way
it's possible.

30:45.470 --> 30:47.028
I say we give it a shot.

30:48.910 --> 30:51.105
Yeah, we'll give it a shot.

30:51.150 --> 30:54.938
EMORY: Some of the children
are only with us a few weeks.

30:54.980 --> 30:57.517
Just long enough for
their parents to get clean,

30:57.550 --> 31:00.439
or get their act together
enough to regain custody.

31:00.490 --> 31:02.219
A lot of them end up
coming back.

31:02.260 --> 31:03.454
Any ever get adopted out?

31:03.490 --> 31:04.889
EMORY:
Uh, once in a while.

31:04.930 --> 31:06.488
Mostly the
younger ones.

31:06.530 --> 31:09.522
Couples in the market
for a little bundle of joy

31:09.560 --> 31:11.369
to jazz up the
Christmas card

31:11.400 --> 31:14.494
aren't real eager to
bring a surly teenager

31:14.540 --> 31:17.100
into their home,
doesn't even share their DNA.

31:17.140 --> 31:19.529
Most part, you're here
after your tenth birthday,

31:19.570 --> 31:21.936
you're here for the duration.

31:23.510 --> 31:25.341
CLAY: (clears throat)
What about, uh,

31:25.380 --> 31:26.677
what about foster care?

31:26.710 --> 31:28.075
That's a dice roll.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.246
Department does
what they can

31:29.280 --> 31:32.044
on their budget,
but never weed out

31:32.090 --> 31:34.149
all the crazies, entrepreneurs
in it for the check.

31:34.190 --> 31:36.408
You ask me, kids are
better off with us.

31:36.460 --> 31:39.384
At least here,
they know they're safe.

31:39.430 --> 31:40.920
Our "library."

31:42.230 --> 31:45.393
Obviously, no one's giving
us money for books.

31:45.430 --> 31:47.193
Barely give us
enough for food.

31:47.230 --> 31:49.698
So, the older kids leave
theirs here when they move out.

31:49.740 --> 31:52.629
Uh, Brian's dad, we called
Salinas-- place he did time--

31:52.670 --> 31:55.070
but they had no idea where he
might've gone after he got out.

31:55.110 --> 31:56.429
Any chance you got
some records somewhere

31:56.480 --> 31:57.435
might help us find him?

31:57.480 --> 31:58.549
Uh, I can check.

31:58.580 --> 32:00.002
You want to come back
to the office?

32:10.560 --> 32:12.551
*

32:40.120 --> 32:42.111
*

32:46.460 --> 32:48.655
You, uh... haven't asked

32:48.700 --> 32:50.691
what I found out
about Brian's dad.

32:50.730 --> 32:53.494
I figured nothing.
Otherwise you would've told me.

32:53.530 --> 32:55.532
He's dead.

32:55.570 --> 32:58.539
Took a knife in the chest
outside of a strip club

32:58.570 --> 33:00.299
a few weeks after he
got out of Salinas.

33:00.340 --> 33:01.739
(exhales)

33:01.780 --> 33:04.044
I guess that's not
really a shocker.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.775
Still.

33:05.810 --> 33:08.449
It's a hell of a thing
for a kid to have to carry,

33:08.480 --> 33:10.368
family like that.

33:10.420 --> 33:12.388
Wonder how Brian managed it.

33:12.420 --> 33:14.411
Apparently,
he made up a new one.
(laughs)

33:14.460 --> 33:17.156
I guess he did, didn't he?

33:19.530 --> 33:21.418
Shame he didn't live long enough
to realize

33:21.460 --> 33:23.451
teams are all the family
any of us need.

33:23.500 --> 33:24.319
(chuckles)

33:24.370 --> 33:27.021
"Teams are all the family
you need"?

33:27.070 --> 33:30.369
What, did you see that on a
recruiting poster somewhere?

33:35.540 --> 33:37.235
What about you?

33:37.280 --> 33:38.645
You were how old
when you went to live

33:38.680 --> 33:40.545
with your grandparents? Five?

33:44.450 --> 33:46.486
I was five
when my old man split.

33:49.220 --> 33:50.517
Then, uh...

33:50.560 --> 33:52.755
my mom, she tried to do
the single parenting thing

33:52.790 --> 33:54.326
for a few months, and...

33:54.360 --> 33:56.555
I was about six

33:56.600 --> 33:58.659
when _she sent me to
live With her parents.

33:58.700 --> 34:01.089
They were missionaries,
your dad told me.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.596
Yeah.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.438
Good people?

34:05.470 --> 34:08.576
Best I ever knew.

34:08.610 --> 34:09.736
Think you'd have been
better off

34:09.780 --> 34:13.568
if you, uh,
stayed with your mom?

34:13.610 --> 34:15.749
No, I don't think so.
(clears throat)

34:15.780 --> 34:18.283
Way I hear it, my mom
was kind of a mess back then.

34:19.320 --> 34:21.618
What about Ash?

34:21.660 --> 34:22.786
You could've moved back in
with him.

34:22.820 --> 34:25.789
I wanted to get as far away
from that guy as possible.

34:28.830 --> 34:31.663
Like I said,
teams are your real family.

34:31.700 --> 34:33.520
You don't know it yet,

34:33.570 --> 34:36.539
but you will.

34:39.570 --> 34:41.208
ERIC:
All right.

34:41.240 --> 34:44.107
This will be a full run-through
with live role-players.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.539
Keep in mind, gentlemen,
this is our final shot.

34:46.580 --> 34:48.445
We miss our time,
there's no more do-overs.

34:48.480 --> 34:49.674
Make it count.

34:49.720 --> 34:52.746
(clears throat)

34:52.790 --> 34:54.587
Look, uh, before...

34:54.620 --> 34:55.780
What I said...

34:55.820 --> 34:58.357
What you actually didn't say.
Yeah, well...

34:58.390 --> 35:00.585
either way,
I shouldn't have got near it.

35:00.630 --> 35:03.394
What happened with
Nate, that's, uh...

35:03.430 --> 35:04.658
that's war, man.

35:04.700 --> 35:06.122
Appreciate that.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.434
Doesn't mean I like you.

35:08.470 --> 35:10.631
But...
Appreciate that, too.

35:12.410 --> 35:14.776
All right,
role-players are in place.

35:14.810 --> 35:16.471
How's it looking?
Bravo's ready.

35:16.510 --> 35:17.579
Charlie, same.

35:17.610 --> 35:19.703
All right. Let's do this.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.354
Bravo Team set.

35:37.400 --> 35:39.391
We've reached
the horizontal ducts.

35:39.430 --> 35:40.658
Copy. Charlie set.

35:40.700 --> 35:41.837
Standing by.

35:41.870 --> 35:44.532
B_ravo Team
movmg to breach.

36:12.970 --> 36:15.165
*

36:25.450 --> 36:27.179
(mock gunshots)

36:42.830 --> 36:45.219
(screams)
Hey. Go.

36:45.270 --> 36:47.693
Up. Up. Come on.

36:47.730 --> 36:49.288
Let's go!

36:51.340 --> 36:52.705
Jackpot.

36:52.740 --> 36:53.832
Target secure.

36:53.870 --> 36:55.679
Roger, Bravo 1.

36:55.710 --> 36:56.938
On my "go."

36:56.980 --> 36:58.868
Three, two,

36:58.910 --> 37:01.242
one-- execute.

37:01.280 --> 37:02.918
Execute.

37:31.780 --> 37:33.475
*

37:56.940 --> 37:58.601
(mock gunshots)

38:01.040 --> 38:02.029
Go.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.898
That's a good workout.
I told you they'd get it.

38:23.930 --> 38:25.921
Nice job.

38:26.970 --> 38:28.790
All right, boys, ENDEX.

38:28.840 --> 38:29.795
What was the time?

38:29.840 --> 38:32.058
12 minutes and change.
Two minutes to spare.

38:32.110 --> 38:33.532
Okay, tell you what.

38:33.570 --> 38:35.401
What do you say
we run this again, huh?

38:35.440 --> 38:38.079
This time, why don't you
give us some curveballs?

38:40.110 --> 38:41.975
Welcome back.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.976
Find what you're looking for?

38:44.020 --> 38:45.578
Not really.

38:45.620 --> 38:47.508
Oh, sorry to hear it.

38:47.550 --> 38:48.983
Can I get you something?

38:49.020 --> 38:51.056
Be honest, ma'am, we were hoping

38:51.090 --> 38:52.352
you could sit with us
for a sec.

38:52.390 --> 38:54.028
A sec, I guess.

38:54.060 --> 38:55.459
Slow morning and all.

39:14.750 --> 39:18.447
Uh, look, ma'am...

39:18.490 --> 39:20.014
I'm afraid it's our duty

39:20.050 --> 39:23.918
to inform you that...

39:23.960 --> 39:27.851
Brian Armstrong died two
days ago in rural Virginia.

39:30.900 --> 39:32.629
At this time,
we cannot disclose

39:32.670 --> 39:34.535
the nature of his death,

39:34.570 --> 39:36.162
but on behalf of the
Secretary of Defense...

39:36.200 --> 39:37.861
I'm not his kin.

39:39.910 --> 39:42.879
As far as we know,
he didn't have any.

39:42.910 --> 39:44.901
(voice breaking):
Oh, that's awful.

39:47.210 --> 39:49.075
But what he did have

39:49.120 --> 39:51.941
was he had a lot of people
who went out of their way

39:51.990 --> 39:54.857
to keep him safe until
he could do that for himself.

39:56.890 --> 40:00.155
And you're one
of those people.

40:00.190 --> 40:01.896
Think you should be proud
of that.

40:08.070 --> 40:10.061
(indistinct chatter)

40:16.640 --> 40:19.143
(whistles quietly)

40:19.180 --> 40:22.115
(indistinct conversation)

40:25.150 --> 40:28.187
What's up?
Bad news, fellas.

40:28.220 --> 40:29.482
Op's cancelled.

40:31.260 --> 40:33.558
Do we know why?
Do we ever know why?

40:34.560 --> 40:36.118
(whistles sharply)

40:36.160 --> 40:38.151
ERIC: According
to Mandy, turns out

40:38.200 --> 40:39.929
Hassan wasn't even
In the bunker.

40:39.970 --> 40:42.063
Meaning he got
spooked, took off?

40:42.100 --> 40:43.499
Or he wasn't even there
In the first place.

40:46.270 --> 40:47.862
Thank you for
your hard work.

40:47.910 --> 40:49.207
Tell your boys
to get some rest.

40:49.240 --> 40:50.707
Back at it on Monday.

40:50.740 --> 40:52.173
Right.
Look at it this way.

40:52.210 --> 40:54.917
Next time Abu Hassan
shows up in that bunker,

40:54.950 --> 40:57.009
we don't have to sit around
and wait for a green light.

40:57.050 --> 40:58.813
All right?
Maybe we get there in time.

40:58.850 --> 41:01.182
Right.

41:01.220 --> 41:03.211
Yeah...
Yep.

41:03.260 --> 41:04.955
(loudly):
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!
Ca-caw.

41:04.990 --> 41:06.252
What is that?

41:06.290 --> 41:07.826
Cank bird.

41:07.860 --> 41:10.226
There's a cank bird?
Yep.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.490
Shows up just before
an op gets canked.
Like an omen.

41:12.530 --> 41:14.964
It's Indian.
Well, Native American.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.194
SONNY:
Anyone else hungry?
Yeah.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.298
GARCIA: Yeah, I'm pretty sure
one of them gentlemen clubs

41:17.340 --> 41:20.832
up on 17 just started
a breakfast buffet.
Whoo!

41:20.870 --> 41:22.269
Well, what the hell
we waiting for?

41:22.310 --> 41:23.504
Let's make it rain.

41:42.160 --> 41:43.957
I was a friend
of Nate Massey's.

41:46.000 --> 41:46.989
I know who you are.

41:49.570 --> 41:50.764
You worked with him.

41:58.850 --> 42:00.602
You're not having any tea?

42:00.650 --> 42:02.641
Not yet.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.887
Put it in your mouth.
I'm sorry?

42:04.920 --> 42:06.649
Hold the sugar
between your teeth,

42:06.690 --> 42:08.214
and drink the tea
through it.

42:08.250 --> 42:10.889
That's how I learned
to drink it

42:10.920 --> 42:12.626
when I was a little girl.

42:12.660 --> 42:13.922
Sugar in the t...

42:15.960 --> 42:16.927
Like this?

42:16.960 --> 42:18.860
(chuckling)

42:21.030 --> 42:21.894
Mm-hmm.

42:24.640 --> 42:25.766
Yeah. Okay.

42:25.810 --> 42:29.576
That's how you drink tea
in Afghanistan?

42:29.610 --> 42:33.239
That's how my family
drinks tea in Afghanistan.

42:33.280 --> 42:36.340
Do_ all Americans drink
their tea the same way?

42:37.980 --> 42:39.641
I didn't me...
I'm sorry, I, uh...

42:39.690 --> 42:40.987
You know what,
I should probably...

42:41.020 --> 42:43.614
No, I... I'm sorry.

42:51.230 --> 42:53.266
Do you want to talk about Nate?
