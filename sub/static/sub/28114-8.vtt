WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:04.599
Um, hello?

00:04.600 --> 00:07.539
Hi. Is somebody there?

00:07.540 --> 00:08.779
Is this, uh... ?

00:10.330 --> 00:12.179
Oh. Can you repeat that?

00:12.180 --> 00:13.979
I can't understand what you're saying.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.279
Okay, great.

00:18.280 --> 00:21.179
Um, I've been told that you have,

00:21.180 --> 00:24.889
uh, a room with a heart-shaped tub.

00:24.890 --> 00:28.119
A tub that is, uh, shaped like a heart.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.919
No reservations.

00:29.920 --> 00:31.199
Cash in hour.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.738
Oh, okay.

00:32.740 --> 00:35.159
Um... listen, we would only need it

00:35.160 --> 00:36.659
for about three hours.

00:36.660 --> 00:38.839
Cleaning now. Now clean.

00:38.840 --> 00:39.879
Someone clean room.

00:39.880 --> 00:41.339
Okay, good. Good.

00:41.340 --> 00:43.339
Clean is good. I love clean.

00:43.340 --> 00:44.709
I pay now?

00:44.710 --> 00:46.009
Wait 40 minutes.

00:46.010 --> 00:47.539
You pay. 40 minutes.

00:47.540 --> 00:49.809
I have to wait 40... ?

00:49.810 --> 00:52.679
Can I reserve it?

00:52.680 --> 00:54.290
Ugh.

00:58.640 --> 01:00.319
Ugh!

01:02.260 --> 01:04.159
I don't know about this, dude.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.310
You never, ever support me.

01:07.330 --> 01:08.999
I do support you.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.879
I'm in the middle of East L.A.
renting you a sex motel room.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.019
You could get pregnant

01:14.020 --> 01:16.749
from bumping into the
furniture in this hotel.

01:16.750 --> 01:18.319
Sorry, Mom. Not all of us knew

01:18.320 --> 01:21.739
we wanted to be actors
at age nine or whatever.

01:21.740 --> 01:24.690
Honey, I support you. Okay?

01:24.700 --> 01:26.919
I support your vision.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.189
What is your vision, by the way?

01:29.190 --> 01:31.599
We need to shoot here.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.919
This is the original motel from the '40s

01:33.920 --> 01:37.059
with, like, the first heart-shaped tubs

01:37.060 --> 01:40.859
and, like, the decay and-and all that.

01:40.860 --> 01:42.529
Mm-hmm.

01:42.530 --> 01:45.179
Never mind. You wouldn't get it.

01:45.180 --> 01:48.359
Of course I get it. I
was young once, too.

01:48.360 --> 01:51.239
I used to do shit like
this all the time.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.450
One time, my friends and I...

01:57.750 --> 02:00.130
I support you. I do.

02:01.780 --> 02:03.549
You're really following through.

02:03.550 --> 02:05.299
Good for you.

02:05.300 --> 02:08.348
I can't wait to see the pictures.

02:08.350 --> 02:10.520
Thanks, Mom.

02:12.070 --> 02:13.959
You can go now.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.329
Oh, no way.

02:15.330 --> 02:17.619
I ain't leaving you here alone. Nope.

02:17.620 --> 02:19.499
We will wait.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.499
I love the cleaning.

02:21.500 --> 02:22.799
Keep on cleaning.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.970
Wax on, wax off.

02:26.440 --> 02:28.409
Okay.

02:28.410 --> 02:31.509
Whoa!

02:31.510 --> 02:34.259
Ha-ha! Smells like my 20s.

02:34.260 --> 02:35.479
Really?

02:35.480 --> 02:37.289
Yes.

02:37.290 --> 02:39.319
- Oh, it's great.
- Okay, please try

02:39.320 --> 02:42.179
not to touch any surface of this room

02:42.180 --> 02:43.289
with your bare skin.

02:43.290 --> 02:44.899
Okay, Mom. Thanks.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.049
You can go now.

02:46.050 --> 02:47.629
Okay.

02:47.630 --> 02:49.969
- Sam, hi!
- Hi.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.629
- Hi, baby.
- Dude, this place...

02:51.630 --> 02:52.769
- C'est magnifique.
- You look beautiful.

02:52.770 --> 02:54.569
Sam, bonjour.

02:54.570 --> 02:56.969
- Bonjour. Ça va?
- Ça va très bien.

02:56.970 --> 02:59.439
This is, like, super professional...

02:59.440 --> 03:01.879
set up, nice, cool.

03:01.880 --> 03:03.179
Oh.

03:03.180 --> 03:05.179
Is that what you're gonna wear?

03:05.180 --> 03:07.319
Hmm. Okay.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.719
- Well, yeah.
- Okay, Mom. We're good.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.149
We only have three hours.

03:10.150 --> 03:12.789
So, you like the part where I drive you

03:12.790 --> 03:14.540
and I pay for the things, hmm?

03:14.550 --> 03:17.059
- Ollivier can drive me back.
- I'll-I'll make sure

03:17.060 --> 03:18.859
your daughter gets home
safely, Sam, okay?

03:18.860 --> 03:21.279
And thank you so much for
everything that you've done.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.039
For the film, for the lens,

03:23.040 --> 03:25.779
for creating such a talented daughter.

03:25.780 --> 03:27.090
C'est vraiment joli.

03:28.340 --> 03:30.439
Cute.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.479
So sweet. Oh.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.909
Oh, okay.

03:33.910 --> 03:35.839
Changing right there. Paisley.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.819
Okay, so,

03:37.820 --> 03:40.539
you have to lock this door
and let no people in.

03:40.540 --> 03:42.199
No person. Nobody.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.639
- Bien sûr, belle-mère. No problem.
- Okay?

03:43.640 --> 03:44.649
- I got it.
- Okay.

03:44.650 --> 03:46.319
And, uh, I got...

03:46.320 --> 03:48.459
Here's your water,

03:48.460 --> 03:50.959
and here is some Purell,

03:50.960 --> 03:53.199
and there's healthy snacks in here,

03:53.200 --> 03:54.599
but don't take them out and put them

03:54.600 --> 03:56.729
on the surface of the bureau, okay?

03:56.730 --> 03:59.759
So, just, um, barricade this door.

03:59.760 --> 04:00.839
- Yes.
- I mean barricade it.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.330
Like, put that in front of it, okay?

04:03.340 --> 04:05.459
'Cause if anybody walks
in here and sees this,

04:05.460 --> 04:08.259
I could get arrested. What's happening?

04:08.260 --> 04:09.860
I feel like I'm in trouble.

04:18.269 --> 04:20.319
You working?

04:20.320 --> 04:21.789
What?

04:21.790 --> 04:23.859
You working?

04:23.860 --> 04:26.129
Am I working?

04:26.130 --> 04:27.459
No...

04:27.460 --> 04:29.819
Oh, yeah. Am I working?

04:29.820 --> 04:32.770
No.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.539
Okay.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.939
Hang on. Can I ask you something?

04:40.940 --> 04:42.109
Yeah.

04:42.110 --> 04:44.879
What's the going rate

04:44.880 --> 04:46.829
for someone like me?

04:46.830 --> 04:48.749
Depends.

04:48.750 --> 04:50.299
On what?

04:50.300 --> 04:51.989
It's a buyer's market.

04:51.990 --> 04:55.539
So... 15 minutes.

04:55.540 --> 04:56.719
What's a good offer?

04:56.720 --> 05:00.189
The top ain't bad, but
how's your caboose?

05:00.190 --> 05:02.959
It's-it's a nice caboose.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.499
It's tight and high.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.990
Let me see.

05:11.140 --> 05:12.919
35.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.279
35?

05:15.280 --> 05:17.179
I was thinking 40,

05:17.180 --> 05:19.449
but the hand brace took it down.

05:19.450 --> 05:21.609
Oh.

05:21.610 --> 05:25.499
Mm. Okay.

05:29.190 --> 05:31.130
- See you around.
- Have a nice day.

05:36.470 --> 05:40.050
I love that fucking car.

05:44.870 --> 05:49.240
Blue, purple and rainbow confetti.

05:49.540 --> 05:53.460
Yellow, green, pink.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.679
Fat carrot.

05:57.680 --> 06:00.099
Eggs with mustache.

06:00.100 --> 06:03.560
Eggs as basketballs, baseballs.

06:03.570 --> 06:05.860
Baby chicken being born in a pot of tea.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.039
Straw coming out of his head.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.239
Can I get five gold star balloons

06:10.240 --> 06:12.219
and the letter K? Do
you have the letter K?

06:12.220 --> 06:14.840
- And H and J.
- The letters H and J.

06:14.850 --> 06:16.089
Mylar or latex?

06:16.090 --> 06:18.089
- Mylar.
- Mylar.

06:18.090 --> 06:20.659
- We're out of Mylar.
- They're out of Mylar.

06:20.660 --> 06:22.680
You can't be serious.
They're out of Mylar?

06:22.690 --> 06:25.139
- Out of Mylar.
- Oh, my God. That's ridiculous.

06:25.140 --> 06:27.489
Fine. I'll just do latex.

06:27.490 --> 06:28.959
Can you tell me...

06:28.960 --> 06:32.119
is there a way to drive
with balloons? Like,

06:32.120 --> 06:34.459
is there, like, a protocol
for blown-up balloons

06:34.460 --> 06:36.339
for, like, visibility?

06:36.340 --> 06:38.419
Well, that's up to you
and how you drive.

06:38.420 --> 06:39.469
You know what I'm saying?

07:32.480 --> 07:33.569
That's so cute.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.499
Can you turn your head a
little bit more to the right?

07:40.700 --> 07:42.179
That's awesome.

07:44.260 --> 07:45.679
Can you just face that
down a little, please?

07:45.680 --> 07:46.689
Of course.

07:46.690 --> 07:48.399
- Oh, that looks awesome.
- Right?

07:48.400 --> 07:50.649
- Good night.
- Night.

08:30.140 --> 08:32.089
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

08:32.090 --> 08:34.779
Whoa! Thank you.

08:34.780 --> 08:37.830
Oh. Really?

08:38.590 --> 08:41.299
Real-oh?

08:41.299 --> 08:43.369
Huh.

08:43.370 --> 08:45.249
Thank you for helping us with the shoot,

08:45.250 --> 08:47.459
belle mère. Bisou.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.159
Ollivier.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.220
Hashtag he fucked her.

08:57.020 --> 08:59.119
- Bape up.
- Hmm.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.900
- Time to bape up.
- Hmm?

09:00.910 --> 09:02.819
Don't you want to come and see what

09:02.820 --> 09:04.709
the Easter Bunny left you?

09:09.460 --> 09:12.209
Good morning. Good morning.

09:12.210 --> 09:14.579
The Easter Bunny came.

09:14.580 --> 09:17.679
- What do you think about that?
- Oh, my God.

09:17.680 --> 09:19.539
Mom, must we with the charade?

09:19.540 --> 09:21.300
Yes, we must!

09:21.310 --> 09:23.979
We must! Good morning!

09:23.980 --> 09:27.009
How are you? Guess what?

09:27.010 --> 09:30.579
Candy. Candy for breakfast.

09:30.580 --> 09:32.979
Peter Cottontail is
downstairs. Let's go!

09:32.980 --> 09:34.399
Thank you, Mom.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.609
Phil!

09:38.610 --> 09:41.329
I didn't find my name on a basket.

09:41.330 --> 09:43.839
You don't get a basket. You're Jewish.

09:43.840 --> 09:46.379
Darling, you better hurry.

09:46.380 --> 09:47.819
It's a brunch, you know,

09:47.820 --> 09:50.139
and the food always goes
cold if you're late.

09:50.140 --> 09:53.639
Oh, I'm not going, but I
made a nice cake for you

09:53.640 --> 09:56.299
- to bring to Walter.
- You certainly are going.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.569
I'm not going on my own.

09:57.570 --> 09:58.899
You are.

09:58.900 --> 10:00.460
- Yes!
- What?!

10:00.470 --> 10:02.379
Ooh, candy!

10:02.380 --> 10:04.499
You said you were coming with me.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.899
I never said that. I was never going.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.199
Then I'll take Duke.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.600
Duke wants to stay home
with me. Don't you, honey?

10:11.660 --> 10:14.979
There are gonna be games,
and an Easter egg hunt

10:14.980 --> 10:16.759
and all sorts of things.

10:16.760 --> 10:18.199
- I'll go.
- Hmm?

10:18.200 --> 10:20.529
Is it okay, Mom?

10:20.530 --> 10:21.979
Not that you asked,

10:21.980 --> 10:23.919
but I think this whole
holiday is offensive.

10:23.920 --> 10:27.550
Like, it's-it's basically
marking the fertility of women.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.959
Like, the beginning of breeding season.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.419
But we like the candy.

10:31.420 --> 10:35.699
Duke, grab your basket, go
upstairs and get dressed.

10:35.700 --> 10:38.649
You're going with Nan to her
married boyfriend's house.

10:38.650 --> 10:40.400
Okay.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.779
Mm, come on. Let's go upstairs.

10:45.780 --> 10:48.239
His wife is 82,

10:48.240 --> 10:50.139
and she has advanced Alzheimer's

10:50.140 --> 10:52.419
and sits in a chair all day long.

10:52.420 --> 10:55.890
But doesn't it feel
disrespectful to her?

10:55.900 --> 10:58.139
I mean, how do you think that she feels?

10:58.140 --> 11:01.540
Oh, Pipsqueak, if you haven't
worked this out by now,

11:01.550 --> 11:03.929
life gets very complicated.

11:03.930 --> 11:07.019
When you're young and someone's married,

11:07.020 --> 11:08.579
it's an automatic no.

11:08.580 --> 11:11.179
But as you get older,

11:11.180 --> 11:14.369
you see that... sometimes

11:14.370 --> 11:16.959
some people find
themselves in situations

11:16.960 --> 11:18.999
that are untenable.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.579
And yet they can't leave a marriage.

11:21.580 --> 11:23.819
There's insurance and children

11:23.820 --> 11:25.949
and illness, property.

11:25.950 --> 11:27.729
There's a million reasons

11:27.730 --> 11:29.919
why they stay together
when they shouldn't.

11:29.920 --> 11:32.299
So the question doesn't become

11:32.300 --> 11:34.339
"Are you married"

11:34.340 --> 11:37.219
but "How married are you?"

11:37.220 --> 11:40.059
Hmm.

11:40.060 --> 11:44.679
And to answer your question,
"How does his wife feel?"

11:44.680 --> 11:47.879
I think she sits in a chair
and drools all day long.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.179
That's what I think.

11:49.180 --> 11:51.589
That cake is adorable, by the way.

11:51.590 --> 11:53.169
Put it in the tin.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.419
Ta-ra.

12:01.210 --> 12:02.969
Oh, look who's here.

12:02.970 --> 12:04.779
Happy, happy.

12:04.780 --> 12:06.519
- I brought you a cake.
- Ah.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.079
Old family recipe.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.799
Thank you, sweetheart.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.500
Mmm.

12:14.590 --> 12:17.629
My... My sister Delia.

12:17.630 --> 12:20.200
- This is my friend Phyllis.
- Hello.

12:22.350 --> 12:25.139
Uh, Duke, uh,

12:25.140 --> 12:27.569
you go downstairs with the kids, 'cause

12:27.570 --> 12:29.949
they're hiding the Easter eggs out back.

12:29.950 --> 12:33.039
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:33.040 --> 12:36.079
So, you're the British lady

12:36.080 --> 12:37.969
this guy can't stop squawking about.

12:37.970 --> 12:39.189
I'm Jeremy,

12:39.190 --> 12:41.929
blessed with the best
genes of all the bunch.

12:41.930 --> 12:44.969
And such a humble man at that.

12:44.970 --> 12:46.549
Get out of here.

12:48.550 --> 12:50.529
This is so pretty.

12:50.530 --> 12:53.789
May the 57th annual

12:53.790 --> 12:57.539
Stanton Family Easter Egg Hunt...

12:57.540 --> 12:58.900
begin!

13:05.100 --> 13:07.059
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.339
Oh.

13:11.340 --> 13:12.849
Oh...

13:12.850 --> 13:14.439
There's more over there.

13:14.440 --> 13:15.709
Okay. Found one.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.300
Aah!

13:23.560 --> 13:25.039
Ow.

13:27.580 --> 13:30.600
- Ah, is it bleeding?
- It's just a little scratch.

13:32.280 --> 13:34.429
Get back in there. Eye on the prize.

13:34.430 --> 13:36.399
Are you sure she didn't cut her cornea?

13:36.400 --> 13:38.039
Are you seeing blurry, honey?

13:38.040 --> 13:40.399
- Hmm.
- No, she's just fine.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.599
Tough as nails.

13:42.600 --> 13:43.719
There we are.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.850
I've got some Neosporin in the house.

13:45.860 --> 13:46.940
Let me fix you up, sweetie.

13:48.350 --> 13:49.899
Come on, sweetie.

13:49.900 --> 13:51.739
Let me fill up your basket, dear.

13:51.740 --> 13:54.779
- Oh.
- Go on.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.520
Come on out.

14:14.100 --> 14:16.960
You got wet?

14:19.360 --> 14:22.249
... the wrapped ones.

14:22.250 --> 14:25.899
No. Those are the...

14:25.900 --> 14:27.919
Ah.

14:32.860 --> 14:35.080
You know Theresa.

14:49.390 --> 14:51.019
You know...

14:51.020 --> 14:54.319
when your mother got
pregnant with your sister,

14:54.320 --> 14:56.859
I told her she had to get married

14:56.860 --> 14:59.659
to your father right away, but
she didn't want to do that.

14:59.660 --> 15:02.729
So I told her she had to get
an abortion right away.

15:02.730 --> 15:05.089
She didn't want to do that, either.

15:05.090 --> 15:08.819
She never really loved your father.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.639
I suppose that's why

15:10.640 --> 15:13.980
the marriage was doomed from the outset.

15:15.160 --> 15:18.439
These are things you should
know, my little angel.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.539
Hey, little big man.

15:25.540 --> 15:27.839
Hi, Uncle Marion!

15:27.840 --> 15:30.599
Time to go, Phil.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.729
What are you doing here?

15:32.730 --> 15:34.759
You called me to pick you up?

15:34.760 --> 15:35.979
Hmm? Let's go.

15:35.980 --> 15:38.279
Well, I haven't finished my drink.

15:38.280 --> 15:40.379
Ah, that means we can
be here ten more days.

15:40.380 --> 15:41.419
Come on.

15:41.420 --> 15:43.959
Why such a rush?

15:43.960 --> 15:46.249
It's not as if you have anywhere to be.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.869
- Careful.
- It's the truth.

15:48.870 --> 15:51.219
You have no place to be. You
never have any place to be.

15:51.220 --> 15:52.549
That's enough.

15:52.550 --> 15:56.499
You've been play-acting some busy-busy

15:56.500 --> 15:58.859
since you crashed into California.

15:58.860 --> 16:01.000
One second.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.459
You cannot speak to me that way.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.959
I can speak to you any way I like.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.319
You apologize. Now.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.899
Little Lord Fauntleroy.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.569
I mean it, Phil. Say you're sorry.

16:15.570 --> 16:18.100
Well, I do feel sorry.

16:18.110 --> 16:19.569
- Do you?
- I feel sorry

16:19.570 --> 16:22.019
that you are as insecure as your father.

16:22.020 --> 16:23.119
But at least he had

16:23.120 --> 16:24.819
- a sense of humor.
- No more. This is it.

16:24.820 --> 16:28.169
Red line drawn. I demand
a statement of remorse.

16:28.170 --> 16:29.189
A what?

16:29.190 --> 16:30.589
A statement of remorse!

16:30.590 --> 16:31.669
For what?

16:31.670 --> 16:33.639
For everything. For e...

16:33.640 --> 16:34.819
everything!

16:34.820 --> 16:36.799
Pull yourself together.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.589
Making a scene.

16:38.590 --> 16:41.139
I want a statement of remorse, Phil.

16:41.140 --> 16:42.779
For the last 53 years of my life

16:42.780 --> 16:43.979
with you.

16:43.980 --> 16:45.519
And I'm not leaving here until I get it.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.359
Oh, the dramatics.

16:47.360 --> 16:49.369
The neglected Marion.

16:49.370 --> 16:51.399
No one's even asked me
why I'm still out here.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.839
Darling, no one needs to ask.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.079
We all know that little toad of a wife

16:56.080 --> 16:57.749
kicked you to the curb months ago,

16:57.750 --> 17:00.260
but we've been too polite to mention it.

17:02.240 --> 17:03.580
Come on.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.359
Let's get away from Satan.

17:11.220 --> 17:12.459
Hey.

17:12.460 --> 17:14.169
Piece of pie?

17:14.170 --> 17:16.260
Something sweet for my sweet? Hmm?

17:18.660 --> 17:19.858
I think I'll just go

17:19.859 --> 17:20.898
- and freshen up for a moment.
- Hmm? Hmm? No. No, no.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.519
No, sit. Sit down. Sit.

17:25.109 --> 17:28.159
Family is complicated.

17:28.160 --> 17:30.619
It always has been.

17:30.620 --> 17:35.469
But when you round out
enough of these holidays,

17:35.470 --> 17:37.079
focus on the good.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.200
Life is too short.

17:43.820 --> 17:46.139
I'm glad you came today.

17:46.140 --> 17:47.939
Thank you, dear.

17:47.940 --> 17:48.960
Okay.

17:57.760 --> 18:02.399
Is it true that my mom
didn't want to marry my dad?

18:02.400 --> 18:06.030
I'm not gonna even ask
where you heard that from.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.700
My mom didn't love my dad?

18:23.560 --> 18:25.159
Look, kid, I'm gonna tell you something

18:25.160 --> 18:27.480
your mother never will or has to.

18:28.380 --> 18:29.949
Your father's an asshole.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.399
And it's important that you...

18:33.400 --> 18:37.110
are respectful and find love
in your heart for your father.

18:37.780 --> 18:39.659
But I'm telling you, kid,

18:39.660 --> 18:43.119
he is a yoiner and a putz
and a complete schmuck.

18:43.120 --> 18:46.659
Unfortunately, we don't get
to choose our parents.

18:46.660 --> 18:49.779
Just have to play the hand we're dealt.

18:49.780 --> 18:52.199
And the sooner you see
your father for who he is,

18:52.200 --> 18:54.740
the sooner you can move on in life.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.669
And, look...

18:59.670 --> 19:02.289
just because your father is a loser,

19:02.290 --> 19:04.619
that does not rub off on you.

19:04.620 --> 19:05.779
Okay?

19:05.780 --> 19:07.559
It's not genetic. It's not.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.859
You're different, okay?

19:09.860 --> 19:12.219
And not weird-different. Cool.

19:12.220 --> 19:13.380
Cool-different.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.149
All right, and I've got
some other good news.

19:17.150 --> 19:20.559
Your mother may be the greatest
mother in-in the world.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.679
She's crazy

19:22.680 --> 19:25.299
and a complete pain in the ass

19:25.300 --> 19:27.979
and annoying,

19:27.980 --> 19:29.679
but she loves you

19:29.680 --> 19:31.699
and she would do anything for you.

19:31.700 --> 19:34.079
And the most important
thing in the world...

19:34.080 --> 19:35.439
the most important thing...

19:35.440 --> 19:38.249
is that she's there.

19:38.250 --> 19:40.379
You wake up, she's there.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.009
You go to sleep, she's there.

19:42.010 --> 19:43.419
You need her, she's there.

19:43.420 --> 19:45.540
You don't need her, she's there.

19:46.660 --> 19:50.319
Even when she isn't there...

19:50.320 --> 19:51.880
she's there.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.819
She'll always be there,

19:56.820 --> 20:00.420
and that is all that matters.

20:03.260 --> 20:05.759
Okay, what's my favorite ice cream?

20:05.760 --> 20:07.309
- Mint chip.
- That's true.

20:07.310 --> 20:09.540
Let's go get some.

20:41.600 --> 20:45.219
Well, you must be Esther.

20:45.220 --> 20:46.879
Lovely to meet you.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.890
I've heard so much about you.

20:51.060 --> 20:53.359
I'm Phil.

20:53.360 --> 20:56.259
I don't know if Walter's
told you about me,

20:56.260 --> 20:57.959
but he's my friend.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.739
My special friend.

21:00.740 --> 21:03.540
He thinks the world of you.

21:19.110 --> 21:21.660
You have such pretty hair.

21:26.820 --> 21:29.369
I was born behind the veil.

21:29.370 --> 21:31.979
A caulbearer, they call it.

21:31.980 --> 21:34.419
The amniotic sac was still
attached to my head

21:34.420 --> 21:36.190
during birth. Very rare.

21:37.140 --> 21:39.490
Sign of good luck.

21:40.460 --> 21:43.079
It's supposed to protect
me from drowning,

21:43.080 --> 21:45.299
provide good fortune at court,

21:45.300 --> 21:47.459
and grant safety on the battlefield.

21:47.460 --> 21:50.879
And I can also feel ghosts and spirits

21:50.880 --> 21:52.200
due to the caul.

21:56.120 --> 21:59.770
So, you see, I've always felt lucky.

21:59.780 --> 22:01.440
You're lucky, too.

22:01.460 --> 22:03.719
I lost my husband years ago.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.399
So it's just me now.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.179
And I do okay.

22:07.180 --> 22:09.039
