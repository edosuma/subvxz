00:12.378 --> 00:13.743
Yo, you need help
lighting that?

00:16.481 --> 00:18.047
All right. Where's your damn wallet?

00:18.049 --> 00:19.348
Come on, man!
Get it out!

00:19.350 --> 00:20.917
I'm getting it.
I'll cut you, man. I swear.

00:20.919 --> 00:22.585
Take it easy. I'm getting it.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.921
All units move in,
move in, move in!

00:33.164 --> 00:35.131
I'm a cop!

00:35.133 --> 00:37.934
Get off me! I'm a cop!
I'm a cop! Don't fight me, man!

00:37.936 --> 00:39.535
Don't fight me!

00:39.537 --> 00:40.702
Jamie!

00:45.009 --> 00:46.009
Stay right there!

00:46.577 --> 00:47.543
Hands up!

00:47.545 --> 00:48.644
Jamie, are you okay?

00:48.646 --> 00:49.812
Yeah, I think so.

00:49.814 --> 00:51.847
What'd you do that for?
I dropped the knife!

00:51.849 --> 00:53.749
Doesn't matter. You grabbed
for my gun. You're under arrest.

00:53.751 --> 00:54.850
No, I didn't!

00:54.852 --> 00:57.385
You have the right
to remain silent.

00:57.387 --> 01:01.523
I know. My dad's a cop.

01:07.064 --> 01:09.164
<i>Michael,</i>

01:09.166 --> 01:11.032
you up? Breakfast is done!

01:11.034 --> 01:12.467
You know I don't eat breakfast.

01:12.469 --> 01:14.436
Uh, you should
the day of tryouts

01:14.438 --> 01:16.804
for a big math
competition.

01:16.806 --> 01:18.039
You ready?

01:18.041 --> 01:19.040
Yep.

01:19.042 --> 01:20.808
Do you have your calculator?

01:20.810 --> 01:23.374
I told you, we're not allowed
to bring calculators.

01:23.398 --> 01:24.279
Baby,

01:24.280 --> 01:26.280
can you help me
with this bow tie?

01:26.282 --> 01:28.115
That's what you're wearing to
the opening of a youth facility?

01:28.117 --> 01:29.249
I'm not wearing it
for the youth.

01:29.251 --> 01:30.217
I'm wearing it for the cameras.

01:30.219 --> 01:31.151
It's corny.

01:31.153 --> 01:32.553
Say what?
It makes you look

01:32.555 --> 01:33.921
like you work in a restaurant.

01:33.923 --> 01:35.122
Oh, so now you're
a fashion critic?

01:35.124 --> 01:36.824
- Just saying.
- Now you're gonna get it.

01:36.826 --> 01:37.959
Come on, slugger. Come on.

01:37.961 --> 01:39.026
Huh?

01:40.929 --> 01:42.229
Good luck today, son.

01:42.231 --> 01:44.398
And be careful out there, hmm?
Dad,

01:44.400 --> 01:45.699
I'm going to a math contest.

01:45.701 --> 01:47.834
I'm saying,
if you run into the police...

01:47.836 --> 01:50.770
Be polite but know your rights.
All right.

01:50.772 --> 01:53.140
Get out of here.

01:53.142 --> 01:56.143
Rumble, young
man. Rumble.

02:06.488 --> 02:07.438
Mommy, please,
where are you?

02:07.462 --> 02:09.323
Will you shut up?!

02:09.324 --> 02:12.659
Mommy. Mommy.
Well, here we go again.

02:12.661 --> 02:15.194
Oh, my God. At least
she's not singing

02:15.196 --> 02:16.962
“99 Bottles of Beer” anymore.
Mommy, please don't

02:16.964 --> 02:18.831
let them hit me again.

02:18.833 --> 02:20.506
Mommy, don't let them
hit me again.

02:20.530 --> 02:21.268
Yo,

02:21.269 --> 02:23.903
Rent-a-cop, we may... we
might need to pull over again.

02:23.905 --> 02:25.771
Please, Mommy.
Mommy, it hurts. It hurts.

02:25.773 --> 02:27.640
Please,
Mommy,

02:27.642 --> 02:28.841
it hurts. Please.

02:28.843 --> 02:31.343
Please, Mommy,
don't let them hit me again.

02:31.345 --> 02:33.178
Hey, guys. For real now.

02:33.180 --> 02:34.813
Mommy, please!

02:34.815 --> 02:37.082
Yo, seriously!
She's not faking now!

02:37.084 --> 02:39.384
Hey, you want to go back there
and tell 'em to shut up again?

02:39.386 --> 02:42.120
No. You shut 'em up.

02:42.122 --> 02:43.889
Buckle up.

02:43.891 --> 02:45.624
Guys, don't do this!

02:58.972 --> 03:01.440
This lady's out! Stop!

03:01.442 --> 03:03.808
Stop the van, man! Stop!

03:12.418 --> 03:16.287
Yo, how did everybody do
on the game theory question?

03:16.289 --> 03:18.422
- Beasted on it.
- Well, what do you expect?

03:18.424 --> 03:20.524
His mom's a teacher,
and his dad's a sponsor.

03:20.526 --> 03:21.892
Nobody gave me the answers.

03:21.894 --> 03:23.961
Whatever.
Hey, who's up

03:23.963 --> 03:26.830
for chilling at my mom's with
some <i>Call to War 2</i> on the Xbox?

03:26.832 --> 03:28.765
So lame. <i>3's</i>
about to come out.

03:28.767 --> 03:30.720
Hey, guys,
I'll catch up to you later!

03:30.744 --> 03:31.436
What's up?

03:31.437 --> 03:32.733
Just got to take care
of something!

03:32.757 --> 03:34.306
All right. Later, G.

03:34.307 --> 03:36.840
Really, Anthony? You're
pulling me out of a meeting?

03:36.842 --> 03:39.542
Come down to the scene
of a traffic accident?

03:39.544 --> 03:41.211
You need to see
what happened here.

03:41.213 --> 03:44.514
Looks like more of a job
for Highway Patrol.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.817
Yeah, well, this is the private
prison van that was supposed

03:46.819 --> 03:49.753
to be bringing up the witness
for our big fraud trial.

03:49.755 --> 03:51.354
You mean the one that was
in custody in Florida,

03:51.356 --> 03:53.456
Kenny Becker?
Yeah, Kenny was in the van

03:53.458 --> 03:56.192
when it got T-boned
going through the intersection.

03:56.194 --> 03:58.528
It was carrying a bunch of other
prisoners getting picked up

03:58.530 --> 04:01.197
and dropped off all along
the Eastern Seaboard.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.465
So where's Kenny?

04:02.467 --> 04:05.101
We're sorting through
all the IDs,

04:05.103 --> 04:06.269
trying
to figure it out.

04:06.271 --> 04:09.939
Got at least four injured,
one escaped.

04:12.476 --> 04:13.542
And throw in

04:13.544 --> 04:14.744
one D.O.A.

04:14.746 --> 04:16.278
So our witness is in the wind

04:16.279 --> 04:18.113
and we have no way
of tracking him?

04:18.116 --> 04:22.084
That's how it goes
when you travel economy.

04:26.524 --> 04:28.457
Why am I not getting
any information?!

04:28.459 --> 04:31.893
I have a right to
know! I have a right!

04:31.895 --> 04:34.095
You show me! Tell me
who is in charge here!

04:34.097 --> 04:35.864
- Is that Potter?
- That's him.

04:35.866 --> 04:37.999
The hell is he doing?
Take it easy.

04:38.001 --> 04:40.264
- Take it easy?
- What is going on here?!

04:40.265 --> 04:41.678
Our job's not hard
enough without this guy

04:41.679 --> 04:44.946
screwing up our crime scene and
making our life more difficult?

04:44.948 --> 04:47.982
The victim's his son,
Michael Potter. 15 years old.

04:47.984 --> 04:50.152
Three shots
at close range.

04:50.154 --> 04:52.720
That is my son!

04:52.722 --> 04:55.271
Oh, my God.
Somebody, you tell me, you tell me!

04:55.295 --> 04:56.052
What do we know?

04:56.053 --> 04:58.486
No witnesses to the attack.
Looks like he was taking

04:58.488 --> 05:00.788
a shortcut through this lot
to get home.

05:00.790 --> 05:03.124
The boy was an honor student at
Crispus Attucks High School.

05:03.126 --> 05:04.159
Supposed
to be

05:04.161 --> 05:05.960
on his way home
from a math contest.

05:05.962 --> 05:07.662
Was it a robbery? What?

05:07.664 --> 05:09.264
His cell phone was still
in his backpack.

05:09.266 --> 05:10.798
Cash was still
in his wallet.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.834
Maybe he resisted?
But three shots

05:13.836 --> 05:15.402
is a lot
for a robbery.

05:15.404 --> 05:18.005
Talk to me!

05:19.909 --> 05:21.709
Is it true?

05:21.711 --> 05:25.512
Is it true? Is it true?

05:25.514 --> 05:26.681
No, is it true?

05:26.683 --> 05:28.449
No!

05:29.819 --> 05:30.818
Let go of me.

05:30.820 --> 05:32.352
Let go of me. No.
Baby, calm down!

05:32.354 --> 05:35.789
No, I need to see him! No!

05:35.791 --> 05:38.459
My son!

05:38.461 --> 05:40.427
I have to see
my son! No!

05:40.429 --> 05:42.696
That's my boy, Reagan!

05:42.698 --> 05:45.132
That's my boy in that dirt
right there!

05:45.134 --> 05:49.069
Reagan, you better do this
right! That's my son!

05:54.186 --> 05:58.186

Commissioner.

06:43.213 --> 06:45.813
I'm so sorry for your loss.

06:45.815 --> 06:48.783
I'm still waiting for it
to sink in.

06:48.785 --> 06:51.620
I'm not sure what I'll do
when it does.

06:51.622 --> 06:55.156
You'll try to deal,
help the others to deal.

06:55.158 --> 06:57.925
Not sure I have it in me.

06:57.927 --> 06:59.393
Did you?

06:59.395 --> 07:01.162
When you lost your son?

07:04.567 --> 07:06.834
Off and on.

07:06.836 --> 07:10.504
Michael was our only child.

07:10.506 --> 07:12.906
We always kept him off
the streets. But maybe

07:12.908 --> 07:16.377
we tried too hard
and-and left him unprepared...

07:16.379 --> 07:18.245
You can't...

07:18.247 --> 07:20.281
you can't blame yourself.

07:20.283 --> 07:22.015
Yeah.

07:22.017 --> 07:23.917
So you still don't have
anything?

07:23.919 --> 07:26.220
Not yet. But we will soon.

07:26.222 --> 07:27.721
You're certain of that?

07:28.557 --> 07:30.223
I have faith.

07:30.225 --> 07:32.793
I ask you to.

07:35.530 --> 07:38.431
I know we've had
our differences.

07:38.433 --> 07:39.966
With good reason.
We both want

07:39.968 --> 07:43.236
exactly the same thing
right now.

07:44.539 --> 07:46.972
If there's anything
my office can do

07:46.974 --> 07:49.242
to help you or your family...

07:49.244 --> 07:54.880
Just find the son of a bitch
that killed my boy.

08:07.128 --> 08:09.228
Lois.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.836
I'm so sorry.

08:29.583 --> 08:31.550
Any sign of Kenny?

08:31.552 --> 08:32.717
Not yet.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.585
We ID'd all
the other prisoners.

08:34.587 --> 08:36.386
He must have escaped
from the wreck.

08:36.389 --> 08:38.470
You want to go with me when
I have to tell the judge?

08:38.557 --> 08:39.650
Erin, there's something else.

08:39.674 --> 08:41.126
Worse than losing

08:41.128 --> 08:43.594
your key witness
right before a trial?

08:43.596 --> 08:46.330
The female prisoner
dead at the scene?

08:46.332 --> 08:47.565
Her injuries aren't consistent

08:47.567 --> 08:49.433
with being caused
by the accident.

08:49.435 --> 08:50.534
What, like she was beaten?

08:50.536 --> 08:52.270
I thought all the prisoners
were handcuffed.

08:52.272 --> 08:54.472
Something's off here,
I'm telling you.

08:54.474 --> 08:56.807
That's Rick Wolf, Sr.

08:56.809 --> 08:58.609
It's his private
transport company.

08:58.611 --> 09:00.278
His son was
in the front of the van.

09:00.280 --> 09:01.912
Senior flew up from
business meetings

09:01.914 --> 09:03.046
in D.C.

09:03.048 --> 09:04.248
to deal with this.
Look,

09:04.250 --> 09:05.182
not our problem.

09:05.184 --> 09:07.284
We just need
to find Kenny Becker.

09:07.286 --> 09:09.519
This must be Ms. Reagan
from the D.A.'s office.

09:09.521 --> 09:11.388
And I thought
all the good-looking prosecutors

09:11.390 --> 09:12.555
were down south.

09:12.557 --> 09:14.091
Lucky them.

09:14.093 --> 09:15.425
Touché.

09:15.427 --> 09:19.096
I'm concerned with finding
our missing witness.

09:19.098 --> 09:21.999
Yeah, that Kenny,
he's a greased pig, all right.

09:22.001 --> 09:24.734
Just waltzed away from
the scene with his hands cuffed.

09:24.736 --> 09:26.068
But it's New York.

09:26.070 --> 09:28.004
I guess you people are used
to seeing things like that.

09:28.006 --> 09:30.540
I'm gonna need to interview
the other prisoners

09:30.542 --> 09:32.776
you were transporting.
How would that be helpful?

09:32.778 --> 09:33.976
Well, they were

09:33.978 --> 09:36.313
all together. Our witness
may have dropped a clue

09:36.315 --> 09:38.247
as to where he was headed.
I have a contract

09:38.249 --> 09:40.582
to drop these prisoners
in five different jurisdictions

09:40.584 --> 09:41.546
in the next 24 hours.

09:41.548 --> 09:42.583
Well, we wouldn't
take that long.

09:42.584 --> 09:45.923
If you call up the local prosecutors
once we've dropped 'em off,

09:45.924 --> 09:47.924
I'm sure they could hook you up.

09:49.160 --> 09:51.794
Thank you for your help.

09:51.796 --> 09:53.129
Happy to oblige.

09:53.131 --> 09:55.597
Uh, next time I'm in town,

09:55.599 --> 09:57.433
what say we grab a cocktail?

10:07.077 --> 10:09.244
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

10:09.246 --> 10:10.779
Oh, good.

10:13.283 --> 10:14.850
You're gonna be cleared,
you know.

10:14.852 --> 10:16.885
Says who?

10:16.887 --> 10:19.354
He pulled a knife,
he grabbed for your gun.

10:19.356 --> 10:21.923
You had every reason to fear
for your life. End of story.

10:21.925 --> 10:24.159
Actually, I thought
he grabbed for my gun.

10:24.161 --> 10:25.393
The way my shirt ripped,

10:25.395 --> 10:27.362
it might have just got caught.
So maybe,

10:27.364 --> 10:29.764
not the end of the story.

10:29.766 --> 10:31.799
Well, it was his choice
to try to rob someone.

10:31.801 --> 10:33.568
And his bad luck it just
happened to be a cop.

10:33.570 --> 10:35.503
Yeah, and my bad luck that...

10:35.505 --> 10:37.338
his father happened
to be a captain

10:37.340 --> 10:40.241
with the state police
and ex-NYPD.

10:42.412 --> 10:43.911
Hey.

10:45.915 --> 10:49.716
What's eating you is the kid's
father's a cop, just like yours.

10:49.718 --> 10:52.853
He was headed to an Ivy League
school, just like you did.

10:52.855 --> 10:55.589
So why's that kid
on the wrong end of your gun?

10:56.893 --> 10:59.059
What's eating me...

11:00.396 --> 11:02.529
...is I'm not harder to find

11:02.531 --> 11:04.765
when I'm trying
to be hard to find.

11:14.510 --> 11:15.876
Yeah, what time was that
that it happened, huh?

11:17.145 --> 11:18.845
Yeah?

11:18.847 --> 11:21.014
You need to be part
of this conversation.

11:23.351 --> 11:24.951
You sit tight.

11:27.055 --> 11:28.714
- Detective.
-Reverend.

11:28.715 --> 11:30.288
You know Ed Shabazz
from my security team.

11:30.312 --> 11:31.170
Of course.

11:31.171 --> 11:32.951
- He used to be with your department.
- Mm-hmm.

11:32.952 --> 11:34.919
We've brought a suspect
in for you.

11:37.937 --> 11:39.007
You did what?

11:39.008 --> 11:41.795
We found this individual
selling video games on a blanket

11:41.895 --> 11:43.794
outside the organization's
community center.

11:43.796 --> 11:45.897
We traced
the serial numbers.

11:45.899 --> 11:48.099
Same video games my son had just
bought with our credit card.

11:48.101 --> 11:50.868
That's great detective work,
but tell me something.

11:50.870 --> 11:52.936
Why does this man look
like he was beaten?

11:54.306 --> 11:55.472
He fell on the way here.

11:55.474 --> 11:56.973
He fell on what, your fist?

11:57.810 --> 11:58.876
What's your name, sir?

11:58.878 --> 12:00.911
I go by Sh-Shoo Fly.

12:00.913 --> 12:03.179
These men, did they tune you up?

12:04.149 --> 12:06.583
I'm not saying nothing.

12:06.585 --> 12:09.352
Except that I found
those games in the trash.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.187
You didn't find a gun
in there, too, did you?

12:11.189 --> 12:13.656
No. Just the games.

12:13.658 --> 12:14.824
It's unbelievable.
You people complain

12:14.826 --> 12:15.959
about police brutality,

12:15.961 --> 12:17.127
and then you go and do this?

12:17.129 --> 12:18.895
You watch who
you call “you people.”

12:18.897 --> 12:20.130
Oh, pardon me, <i>you.</i>

12:20.132 --> 12:21.298
You want us
to do everything

12:21.300 --> 12:23.433
by the book--
this ain't in our book.

12:23.435 --> 12:25.701
This isn't even part of
your good book, Reverend.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.169
We just brought you a suspect.

12:27.171 --> 12:28.771
If you are serious
about solving this case,

12:28.773 --> 12:30.606
you'd at least
question him.

12:30.608 --> 12:33.342
I can't talk to him
because he got tuned up.

12:33.344 --> 12:35.377
That means everything
he says is tainted now.

12:37.348 --> 12:39.749
Look. I get what you're
trying to do here, okay?

12:39.751 --> 12:40.983
And I understand how you feel.

12:40.985 --> 12:43.218
Really? Are you
making arrangements

12:43.220 --> 12:45.421
to bury one of
your own children?

12:48.725 --> 12:50.859
I'm gonna talk to the reverend
for a second, okay?

12:50.861 --> 12:53.095
Come on.

12:57.268 --> 12:59.468
The lab results came back.

12:59.470 --> 13:00.969
They found a little bit
of marijuana

13:00.971 --> 13:02.270
in your son's system.

13:02.272 --> 13:03.772
We're trying to find out
who the hell sold it to him.

13:03.774 --> 13:05.574
My son was a
straight-A student.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.676
Never touched a
drug in his life.

13:07.678 --> 13:09.678
Look. I have a boy your
son's age. They grow up fast.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.746
Maybe you just didn't know him
as well as you thought you did.

13:11.748 --> 13:14.082
Are you seriously trying to
paint him as a drug abuser?

13:14.084 --> 13:16.050
Absolutely not.
I never said that.

13:16.052 --> 13:18.886
When your father gave
me his assurances,

13:18.888 --> 13:20.688
I thought I could work
with you people.

13:20.690 --> 13:22.323
Watch who you call
“you people.”

13:22.325 --> 13:24.859
You! Detective Reagan.

13:24.861 --> 13:27.128
And I'm gonna demand that you
be taken off of this case.

13:27.130 --> 13:30.998
You don't get to choose who
catches what case, Reverend.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.233
There's too much
bad faith here.

13:33.235 --> 13:35.435
I am going to call the governor,

13:35.437 --> 13:37.437
and have him appoint
a special prosecutor

13:37.439 --> 13:38.806
to take this case over.

13:38.808 --> 13:40.975
You're making a mistake.

13:40.977 --> 13:42.710
I don't have a right
to express my opinion?

13:42.712 --> 13:44.277
Of course you have a right
to express your opinion,

13:44.279 --> 13:46.213
but it's better if
we work together.

13:46.215 --> 13:48.148
We're out of here.

13:48.150 --> 13:50.150
If they can't give us
justice here,

13:50.152 --> 13:53.253
we're gonna go find it
somewhere else.

14:04.781 --> 14:07.382
I know that. People hear
“special prosecutor,”

14:07.384 --> 14:10.051
what they really hear
is cops screwed it up.

14:10.053 --> 14:11.887
- But look at the source.
- I am.

14:11.889 --> 14:13.721
Potter's called for a special
prosecutor on parking tickets.

14:13.723 --> 14:15.190
I know his playbook.

14:15.192 --> 14:15.673
Then we got...

14:15.697 --> 14:17.292
Come on, Sid, we know
what you're gonna say.

14:17.293 --> 14:17.991
What am I gonna say?

14:18.015 --> 14:20.095
“Boss. We can't let our
critics dictate terms to us.”

14:20.997 --> 14:22.296
Well, I'd be right.

14:22.298 --> 14:24.465
Garrett, this isn't just
an image problem for us.

14:24.467 --> 14:26.501
There is a practical problem
as well.

14:26.503 --> 14:28.068
That's right.
The investigation

14:28.070 --> 14:29.937
is stalling out
because the community

14:29.939 --> 14:31.739
has stopped cooperating.

14:31.741 --> 14:34.237
They're buying into when Potter
says we can't be trusted.

14:34.261 --> 14:34.776
Which is why

14:34.777 --> 14:36.576
we have to get him back
on our side publicly.

14:36.578 --> 14:39.880
And immediately. The longer
we let this case go on,

14:39.882 --> 14:41.581
the more it's gonna
cost us in the long run.

14:41.583 --> 14:43.117
So, what,
we bow down

14:43.119 --> 14:44.484
to Potter just because he's on

14:44.486 --> 14:46.486
the megaphone
once again?

14:46.488 --> 14:49.022
But in this case, he is using it

14:49.024 --> 14:51.391
as a man who lost his only son.

14:51.393 --> 14:55.094
That is different
in the worst way.

14:55.096 --> 14:56.396
I don't think

14:56.398 --> 15:00.434
he should get a hall pass
just because he lost his son.

15:00.436 --> 15:03.036
So do we placate him
by turning the case over

15:03.038 --> 15:05.338
to a special prosecutor?

15:06.207 --> 15:09.809
We're not turning it over
to anyone.

15:16.851 --> 15:18.684
You're Janko?

15:18.686 --> 15:20.320
Yeah. Can I help you?

15:20.322 --> 15:21.687
I understand you're
Officer Reagan's partner.

15:21.689 --> 15:24.089
I'd like a word with you
about the shooting by the park.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.825
You one of the
investigators?

15:25.827 --> 15:27.993
It was my son who got shot.

15:27.995 --> 15:31.964
Uh, I really don't think
I should be talking to you.

15:31.966 --> 15:33.332
Is there something I need
to hear about what happened?

15:33.334 --> 15:36.168
You're a state police captain,
and you know the drill.

15:36.170 --> 15:37.336
They got him on the ward
at Bellevue

15:37.338 --> 15:38.971
with a bullet in his abdomen.

15:38.973 --> 15:41.039
You know,
I hope he pulls through.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.140
He will.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.576
But I'd like a word with Reagan.
You know,

15:44.578 --> 15:47.012
he's just gonna tell you exactly
the same thing I just told you.

15:47.014 --> 15:49.181
You just let him know
I'm looking for him.

15:49.183 --> 15:51.216
Here's my card.

15:59.693 --> 16:01.893
My investigators told me
that you have information

16:01.895 --> 16:03.060
on a murder.

16:03.062 --> 16:04.295
Saw it with my own eyes.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.897
I'm listening.
They picked up

16:05.899 --> 16:07.866
a bunch of us for transport,

16:07.868 --> 16:11.002
threw us in the back of a filthy
van like we were animals,

16:11.004 --> 16:13.104
and starved us
for 1,200 miles.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.705
They wouldn't let us
use the bathroom.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.640
They wouldn't give this Katy
her meds.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.009
And when we complained,

16:18.011 --> 16:20.511
they took us for a rough ride.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.214
It's not necessarily
a murder case.

16:23.216 --> 16:26.450
Then what about this?

16:26.452 --> 16:29.319
When Katy started
acting out again,

16:29.321 --> 16:32.589
they stopped the van,
took the cuffs off...

16:36.261 --> 16:38.829
They encouraged the other
prisoners to beat on her.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.231
You know as well as I do
that that woman didn't die

16:41.233 --> 16:43.500
from being
in a traffic accident.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.301
And you're willing
to testify to that?

16:45.303 --> 16:48.438
So long as you get Florida to
drop their charges against me.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.706
That's a heavy lift.

16:50.708 --> 16:53.076
Everyone down south
knows about Big Rick Wolf

16:53.078 --> 16:54.577
and his
murder vans.

16:54.579 --> 16:56.612
This isn't the first time
they've had someone die

16:56.614 --> 16:57.780
in custody.

16:57.782 --> 16:59.949
And they've gotten away with it.

17:00.785 --> 17:03.385
Because everyone's making money

17:03.387 --> 17:05.319
or they're too
scared to talk.

17:05.321 --> 17:08.758
But I've got nothing to lose.

17:08.760 --> 17:12.127
Except prison time.

17:21.704 --> 17:23.672
Seriously, Darnell?

17:23.674 --> 17:25.839
You invited the governor
to sit with us

17:25.842 --> 17:27.776
at the funeral?
Listen to me,

17:27.778 --> 17:30.612
I'm trying to get him
to appoint a special prosecutor.

17:30.614 --> 17:33.949
Darnell, this is the service
for our son.

17:33.951 --> 17:35.550
Yes, it is.

17:35.552 --> 17:38.519
I'm trying to get these people
to recognize his humanity

17:38.521 --> 17:40.021
and-and our loss

17:40.023 --> 17:41.456
and take a stand.

17:41.458 --> 17:43.692
A funeral is a time for us
to come together

17:43.694 --> 17:45.827
and grieve, Darnell.

17:46.697 --> 17:49.564
Michael's death
has to mean something.

17:49.566 --> 17:51.699
It means something!
It means everything!

17:51.701 --> 17:53.834
We don't need
a special prosecutor

17:53.836 --> 17:55.936
to tell us what it means!

17:55.938 --> 17:58.005
You think that that boy
doesn't mean the world to me?

17:58.007 --> 18:00.641
You think that my heart
is not broken like yours?

18:00.643 --> 18:03.744
Because if you don't know that,
Lois, you don't know me at all.

18:07.016 --> 18:08.448
Excuse me, Reverend.

18:08.450 --> 18:09.750
You've got
company.

18:09.752 --> 18:12.886
Not now. Please.
I should tell Reagan

18:12.888 --> 18:14.855
to wait
or come back later?

18:27.336 --> 18:30.303
I realize
this isn't a good time.

18:30.305 --> 18:32.805
There are no more good times
anymore. Say your piece.

18:32.807 --> 18:35.308
We need to turn the heat down
on the rhetoric

18:35.310 --> 18:37.344
and recognize
we have a common goal.

18:37.346 --> 18:39.379
Just different ways
of achieving that goal.

18:39.381 --> 18:41.668
My officers do not discriminate
among victims.

18:41.669 --> 18:45.118
I don't know what's more amazing--
your gall in showing up here

18:45.120 --> 18:47.253
or the fact that you can
say that with a straight face.

18:47.255 --> 18:49.822
But I do have the gall
and the straight face.

18:49.824 --> 18:52.458
I also have the manpower
and the expertise

18:52.460 --> 18:54.694
to catch your
son's killer.

18:54.696 --> 18:56.062
You do not have either.

18:56.064 --> 18:57.916
And the sooner
you accept that...

18:57.917 --> 18:59.431
The sooner
I play the fool.

18:59.433 --> 19:00.699
We cannot do our job

19:00.701 --> 19:03.569
if you and your people
are acting like vigilantes.

19:03.571 --> 19:04.736
So you're putting all this
on my shoulders?

19:04.738 --> 19:06.238
400 years
of institutional racism

19:06.240 --> 19:07.806
and it is my fault...
Please.

19:07.808 --> 19:09.308
...that the police
can't be trusted?

19:09.310 --> 19:12.130
None of this is helping
to get Michael's killer.

19:12.131 --> 19:14.746
Your son even tried to imply
that my child was responsible

19:14.748 --> 19:17.348
for the circumstances
of his own death.

19:18.076 --> 19:19.755
That is not what he was saying.

19:19.756 --> 19:23.856
I didn't see anybody spreading rumors
when your family was in pain.

19:24.658 --> 19:27.425
There really is no talking
to you.

19:27.427 --> 19:29.694
Even now.

19:29.696 --> 19:31.896
Then get off my damn porch.

19:33.466 --> 19:35.433
That's what I like to see.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.935
A dedicated
public servant working,

19:37.937 --> 19:39.837
burning the candle
at both ends.

19:39.839 --> 19:41.739
“It will not last
the night;

19:41.741 --> 19:44.475
“But ah, my foes,
and oh, my friends--

19:44.477 --> 19:46.476
It gives
a lovely light.”

19:46.478 --> 19:48.478
Your office just served
my company with a subpoena,

19:48.480 --> 19:50.514
Ms. Reagan. Mind telling me
what that's about?

19:50.516 --> 19:52.249
Well, you shouldn't be
too surprised.

19:52.251 --> 19:54.518
A prisoner died in your custody
within the confines

19:54.520 --> 19:56.087
of New York County.
That poor woman

19:56.089 --> 19:58.422
was not in the best of health.
Her records will show that.

19:58.424 --> 20:00.290
Records show she shouldn't
have been in the van

20:00.292 --> 20:01.258
in the first place.

20:01.260 --> 20:03.360
That warrant was vacated
months ago.

20:03.362 --> 20:05.195
That lady was no angel,
believe me.

20:05.197 --> 20:06.396
You see her arms?

20:06.398 --> 20:08.332
Rick, let's not get
into the weeds.

20:08.334 --> 20:11.101
Let's just say we did
what we're paid to do.

20:11.103 --> 20:12.902
Great. Then you shouldn't
have any problem

20:12.904 --> 20:15.372
opening your files and
letting us review your records.

20:15.374 --> 20:16.740
If you go up

20:16.742 --> 20:19.609
against us, all your witnesses
will be low-life lawbreakers.

20:19.611 --> 20:22.178
Choirboys rarely witness
major crimes.

20:22.180 --> 20:25.048
But look who you're bringing
to the dance.

20:26.618 --> 20:29.152
Kenny Becker?
Did you know that when

20:29.154 --> 20:30.553
we picked him up in Florida,

20:30.555 --> 20:32.655
he was already in custody there
for another crime?

20:32.657 --> 20:36.292
Yes, he was charged in
connection with a home invasion.

20:36.294 --> 20:37.960
But did you know
that the old lady

20:37.962 --> 20:39.961
his partner tied up
in that house just died?

20:39.963 --> 20:41.129
That makes Kenny

20:41.131 --> 20:42.797
an accessory to murder.

20:42.799 --> 20:44.599
Son, what do you think
the odds are

20:44.601 --> 20:46.801
that a jury will take
his word over ours?

20:46.803 --> 20:48.136
Not good.

20:48.138 --> 20:50.071
Ask yourself, is it worth it?
You're gonna let

20:50.073 --> 20:53.341
a murderer go free
so you can persecute people

20:53.343 --> 20:57.478
who provide a valuable service
to law enforcement nationwide?

21:17.599 --> 21:21.033
Detective Reagan...
is this the suspect?

21:21.035 --> 21:22.601
Why don't you get him out
of here?

21:22.603 --> 21:24.436
I'll put him in the juvenile
room and make some calls.

21:24.438 --> 21:25.738
Mm-hmm.
We heard

21:25.740 --> 21:27.539
you picked up somebody
using my son's credit card.

21:27.541 --> 21:28.447
Maybe.

21:28.448 --> 21:30.093
What's going on?
I'm entitled to know.

21:30.245 --> 21:32.745
Oh, <i>now</i> you want it
to be a two-way street?

21:32.747 --> 21:34.546
Suddenly you want
to share information?

21:34.548 --> 21:35.814
Reagan, come on!

21:35.816 --> 21:37.316
Hey, you take a hike.

21:39.587 --> 21:43.355
We have information that a gang
is targeting young kids

21:43.357 --> 21:45.424
coming out of
a video game store.

21:45.426 --> 21:47.693
Same video game store
that your son was visiting.

21:47.695 --> 21:50.028
So you're gonna question this
young man you just brought in?

21:50.030 --> 21:51.496
He's 15, which means we can't

21:51.498 --> 21:53.498
until a parent or guardian
comes down here.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.633
Hey, break it up,
will you?

21:55.635 --> 21:58.003
Get out of here.
There's nothing to see.

21:58.005 --> 22:00.105
You always manage to find

22:00.107 --> 22:02.240
a way around it.
Why not this time?

22:02.242 --> 22:04.009
Maybe you want me
to find a way around it now

22:04.011 --> 22:05.643
because it has to do
with your son. Is that it?

22:05.645 --> 22:07.279
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

22:07.281 --> 22:10.481
No, I'm not enjoying this
in the least, believe me.

22:10.483 --> 22:11.683
Payback, huh?

22:11.685 --> 22:13.117
For all those times that I

22:13.119 --> 22:15.753
called you out for violating
rights in my community!

22:15.755 --> 22:17.588
You want to know the truth,
Reverend?

22:17.590 --> 22:19.223
Most people

22:19.225 --> 22:21.793
come down off their high horse
when they need something.

22:21.795 --> 22:24.829
But not you. You've stayed
right up where you always are,

22:24.831 --> 22:27.965
and believe it or not, I have
so much more respect for you

22:27.967 --> 22:31.468
for doing that than if
you'd flip and act different.

22:31.470 --> 22:35.172
I hope to God that you're never
where I am right now.

22:35.174 --> 22:39.009
Me, too. But right now,
I'm a voice for your son,

22:39.011 --> 22:41.778
and if you want to help me find
who did this to him,

22:41.780 --> 22:44.781
you got to work with us,
not against us.

22:53.359 --> 22:56.993
Oh. The 18 in selected

22:56.995 --> 22:59.262
sherry oak casks.

22:59.264 --> 23:00.930
Are we celebrating,

23:00.932 --> 23:03.399
or should I be worried
that you've gone on the pad?

23:03.401 --> 23:05.768
That's one thing I
haven't been accused of.

23:05.770 --> 23:09.906
I thought that shooting team
gave you a clean slate.

23:09.908 --> 23:11.741
They did.

23:11.743 --> 23:13.076
All good on that end.

23:13.078 --> 23:16.011
The kid I shot...

23:16.013 --> 23:18.447
his father's a captain
with the state police.

23:18.449 --> 23:19.915
Ex-NYPD.

23:19.917 --> 23:21.650
Makes it worse somehow, huh?

23:21.652 --> 23:25.087
Also got word from my partner
that he wants to see me.

23:26.891 --> 23:28.758
Sounded pretty worked up.
Oh, you can't meet

23:28.760 --> 23:30.192
with the parent of the defendant

23:30.194 --> 23:31.927
you're gonna have
to testify against.

23:31.929 --> 23:33.695
Case is closed.
Kid took the plea.

23:33.697 --> 23:34.642
Yeah?

23:34.666 --> 23:36.532
Maybe he'll
get off drugs in prison.

23:36.533 --> 23:38.867
That's why he tried
to rob you-- drug money?

23:38.869 --> 23:41.669
Yeah, apparently, he had a full
ride on a lacrosse scholarship

23:41.671 --> 23:44.472
when he got injured and then
became addicted to painkillers.

23:44.474 --> 23:46.941
Sad story.

23:50.380 --> 23:52.213
But it's not <i>your</i> sad story.

23:54.183 --> 23:56.851
Which is why I want
to duck the dad.

23:56.853 --> 23:58.586
You're under no obligation.

23:58.588 --> 24:00.555
And there could still
be a civil suit.

24:00.557 --> 24:03.757
I'm not worried about
the civil suit, but...

24:03.759 --> 24:05.927
<i>don't</i> I have an obligation?

24:05.929 --> 24:07.261
As what?

24:07.263 --> 24:11.765
As a cop... to another cop.

24:14.670 --> 24:17.838
My first C.O. once told me

24:17.840 --> 24:20.674
that if there's a conversation
you've been avoiding,

24:20.676 --> 24:25.145
then that's the one
you need to have.

24:38.460 --> 24:40.360
Not so fast.

24:40.362 --> 24:42.963
Come to see us off, did you?

24:42.965 --> 24:44.497
Up here, they like

24:44.499 --> 24:46.032
to make damn sure
you left town.

24:46.034 --> 24:48.268
That's called
<i>northern</i> hospitality.

24:48.270 --> 24:50.503
We got another
subpoena for you.

24:50.505 --> 24:51.537
Give me a break.

24:51.539 --> 24:52.772
Son, let's not be
intolerant.

24:52.774 --> 24:53.973
These New Yorkers may not know

24:53.975 --> 24:55.240
how the rest
of the country works.

24:55.242 --> 24:57.543
Well, unfortunately for you,
you <i>are</i> in New York,

24:57.545 --> 24:59.144
and this is the way it works.

24:59.146 --> 25:03.148
Miss... was I not being
clear enough before?

25:03.150 --> 25:05.985
We're leaving town and taking
our prisoners with us.

25:05.987 --> 25:08.087
Oh, you were clear.
It's just not happening.

25:08.089 --> 25:09.621
Well, it <i>better</i> be happening.

25:09.623 --> 25:12.557
I have to drop these prisoners
in five different jurisdictions

25:12.559 --> 25:13.959
by the end of business today,

25:13.961 --> 25:16.761
and no subpoena for records
is gonna change that.

25:16.763 --> 25:18.998
Well, we're done with
subpoenas for you.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.800
Nah, this one's for you, kid.

25:21.802 --> 25:24.203
You were in the front
of that van when the lady died.

25:24.205 --> 25:28.673
Unpack your bags.
You ain't going nowhere.

25:39.219 --> 25:41.419
Reverend Potter, sir.

25:55.668 --> 25:58.102
Just you?

25:58.104 --> 26:00.470
Please.

26:00.472 --> 26:03.007
What I have to say isn't part
of a bigger conversation.

26:03.009 --> 26:05.442
That'd be a first.

26:05.444 --> 26:08.712
And maybe a last,
but this is just between us.

26:08.714 --> 26:10.614
Fine by me.

26:10.616 --> 26:13.951
I'm reconsidering my position
vis-à-vis cooperation.

26:13.953 --> 26:15.685
In what way?

26:15.687 --> 26:18.321
I understand your detectives
released the boy

26:18.323 --> 26:21.324
who had my son's credit card
on recognizance.

26:21.326 --> 26:24.294
He will still be charged,
but as you know, he is 15.

26:24.296 --> 26:26.696
And his parents bought
a good enough lawyer.

26:26.698 --> 26:29.632
Protecting his rights...
as they should.

26:31.236 --> 26:35.204
But I also realize
that the more time that goes by,

26:35.206 --> 26:37.540
the harder it's going
to be to catch my son's killer.

26:37.542 --> 26:39.308
48, to be exact.

26:39.310 --> 26:41.410
What's that?
Hours.

26:41.412 --> 26:44.047
In our job, the odds
crater after that.

26:51.255 --> 26:55.591
I'm asking our community
to cooperate with the NYPD.

26:55.593 --> 26:57.960
Just this once?
I have

26:57.962 --> 27:01.130
always said that there are
good cops and bad cops.

27:01.132 --> 27:02.528
But a lot less about
the good ones.

27:02.552 --> 27:03.800
You mind?!

27:03.801 --> 27:07.335
You're still preaching to your
choir. I'm not in your choir.

27:09.172 --> 27:11.772
The cops can't do their jobs
without us,

27:11.774 --> 27:16.077
and we can't keep the
communities safe without them.

27:21.718 --> 27:24.018
At last.

27:24.020 --> 27:25.686
Oh, cut it out.

27:25.688 --> 27:29.823
This is more complicated than
you'd admit to, and you know it.

27:29.825 --> 27:33.527
Let's just meet halfway.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.500
Okay.

27:39.502 --> 27:41.101
You're prepared to let my people

27:41.103 --> 27:43.069
do their job
without interference?

27:43.071 --> 27:46.006
Yes.

27:46.008 --> 27:48.808
Then thank you.

27:50.712 --> 27:55.982
Darnell, we will bring
your boy's murderer to justice.

27:55.984 --> 27:58.417
Then thank you.

28:27.977 --> 28:30.277
You're the guy
who shot my son.

28:30.279 --> 28:31.311
Captain.

28:31.313 --> 28:32.546
Forget my rank.

28:32.548 --> 28:35.114
I'm not talking to you
as a police officer.

28:41.256 --> 28:43.122
I'm guessing you want
to talk about what happened?

28:43.124 --> 28:45.792
I know what happened.
I read the report.

28:45.794 --> 28:47.627
Then I'm not sure
what else to tell you.

28:47.629 --> 28:49.862
I did my job. I'm sorry
that your son got hurt.

28:49.864 --> 28:51.698
You don't have any kids, do you?

28:51.700 --> 28:53.166
No, not yet.

28:53.168 --> 28:55.001
Want to make God laugh?

28:55.003 --> 28:57.269
Tell him your plans.

28:57.271 --> 28:59.072
Not sure I'm following you.

28:59.074 --> 29:02.274
I wasn't around much when
Scottie was growing up.

29:02.276 --> 29:04.376
Then when I saw
him going down

29:04.378 --> 29:06.378
a bad road with drugs,

29:06.380 --> 29:08.880
I tried tough love.

29:10.618 --> 29:13.985
But all I did was
drive him away.

29:15.623 --> 29:18.724
So I came here

29:18.726 --> 29:21.527
to apologize.

29:21.529 --> 29:23.529
Apologize to me?

29:23.531 --> 29:27.899
My son had some
of the same chances as you,

29:27.901 --> 29:30.602
and now he's going to prison.

29:32.806 --> 29:35.506
That's not how
I thought it would go.

29:35.508 --> 29:38.810
Your son's still young.

29:38.812 --> 29:41.879
Prison doesn't usually
build character.

29:41.881 --> 29:44.115
But at least I know he...

29:44.117 --> 29:49.854
he won't be out on the street,
hurting himself or anyone else.

29:49.856 --> 29:53.023
I hope he finds a way
to turn it around.

29:54.861 --> 29:57.061
Thanks, Reagan.

29:57.063 --> 29:59.563
Me, too.

30:07.006 --> 30:10.274
You really didn't know
what this was about, huh?

30:12.411 --> 30:15.211
Took balls showing up.

30:15.213 --> 30:18.214
Your dad must be proud of you.

30:30.228 --> 30:32.495
That is not gonna work!

30:32.497 --> 30:33.331
The hell are you talking about?

30:33.355 --> 30:34.531
You're trying
to make it look

30:34.532 --> 30:35.765
like you got
all of these people

30:35.767 --> 30:37.290
talking about me.
But I recognize

30:37.291 --> 30:39.157
half of them as just
cops in plainclothes.

30:39.159 --> 30:40.893
Move your ass.
Hey! What's up, Joe?

30:40.895 --> 30:41.470
How's the kids?!

30:41.494 --> 30:43.262
I said move your ass
and shut your mouth.

30:45.099 --> 30:46.465
This won't hold up.

30:46.467 --> 30:48.900
I'll be home before you are.
Says you.

30:48.902 --> 30:50.969
We've got at least
six witnesses telling us

30:50.971 --> 30:53.705
you've switched from
drug dealing to identity theft.

30:53.707 --> 30:55.640
And we know
you're using underage kids

30:55.642 --> 30:57.152
to steal credit cards for you.

30:57.176 --> 30:58.233
I run a group home

30:58.234 --> 31:00.345
that helps disadvantaged
children in the community.

31:00.347 --> 31:02.414
It's a front
for a criminal enterprise.

31:02.416 --> 31:04.281
Oh, my goodness...

31:04.283 --> 31:05.850
We boring you?
Yeah.

31:05.852 --> 31:07.852
It's a lot of noise
for identity theft.

31:07.854 --> 31:09.020
Hmm.

31:10.256 --> 31:13.257
We know you organized kids
from your group home

31:13.259 --> 31:15.359
into a gang
and had them target kids

31:15.361 --> 31:17.862
walking out of a video store
for robberies.

31:17.864 --> 31:19.897
You also encouraged
them to get a body.

31:19.899 --> 31:22.566
So you had them kill someone
as part of their initiation.

31:22.568 --> 31:25.036
You're used to dealing
with feeble brains, aren't you?

31:25.038 --> 31:26.904
Very few as feeble as you.

31:26.906 --> 31:29.740
It's made you lazy,
bad at your jobs.

31:29.742 --> 31:31.542
See, you're lunging
for answers because

31:31.544 --> 31:33.244
you've got
a high-profile case.

31:33.246 --> 31:34.745
But you've got nothing.

31:34.747 --> 31:36.547
And I've got nothing more
to say to you guys.

31:36.549 --> 31:39.550
Except I want my lawyer.

31:39.552 --> 31:40.884
Now.

31:40.886 --> 31:41.985
That may be
the smartest thing

31:41.987 --> 31:43.453
he's said all day.

31:48.493 --> 31:50.594
I'm not given to
bluster, Ms. Reagan.

31:50.596 --> 31:52.595
But this is what you
call a classic case

31:52.597 --> 31:54.330
of prosecutorial
overreach.

31:54.332 --> 31:56.666
A prisoner died
in your custody in your van.

31:56.668 --> 31:59.302
And we now know
it's not the first time.

31:59.304 --> 32:00.670
Not even the fifth.

32:00.672 --> 32:02.072
Reality check?

32:02.074 --> 32:05.041
A lot of these folks
that we transport

32:05.043 --> 32:07.077
don't have healthy
lifestyles to begin with.

32:07.079 --> 32:08.644
Drunks, junkies.

32:08.646 --> 32:10.546
Stuff happens.

32:11.382 --> 32:14.050
Can you tell me
what a screen test is?

32:14.052 --> 32:15.851
Something they do in Hollywood.

32:15.853 --> 32:18.054
It's when a driver
punishes handcuffed prisoners

32:18.056 --> 32:20.756
by driving erratically
so they bounce

32:20.758 --> 32:22.058
into the screen in the van.

32:22.060 --> 32:24.827
Also known as a rough ride.

32:24.829 --> 32:26.528
Autopsy report
came back.

32:26.530 --> 32:29.064
Your prisoner died
from peritonitis.

32:29.900 --> 32:33.401
Internal injuries
from being beaten

32:33.403 --> 32:36.137
that were aggravated
in the wreck.

32:37.707 --> 32:39.574
Tough case for you.

32:39.576 --> 32:40.874
Not that tough.

32:40.876 --> 32:43.511
Your son was in the van
when she was beaten.

32:43.513 --> 32:45.279
He took the cuffs
off the prisoners

32:45.281 --> 32:47.047
and encouraged them to hit her.

32:47.049 --> 32:50.017
We have his text messages
telling you

32:50.019 --> 32:52.219
exactly what was happening.

32:52.221 --> 32:55.689
See, based on what the
prisoners saw in the van,

32:55.691 --> 32:58.859
we got a subpoena for your son's
cell phone service provider.

32:58.861 --> 33:00.127
And, kid,

33:00.129 --> 33:03.063
the words don't look
too good on your end.

33:03.065 --> 33:06.133
But I wouldn't take
all that weight if I was you.

33:08.069 --> 33:09.603
Dad...

33:09.605 --> 33:12.239
Son, don't you worry.

33:12.241 --> 33:15.908
We're gonna get you
the best lawyer money can buy.

33:15.910 --> 33:17.511
Word to the wise,

33:17.513 --> 33:19.446
you might want to find your own.

33:19.448 --> 33:22.381
Your interests
are no longer the same.

33:31.292 --> 33:32.925
Come on. I told you,

33:32.927 --> 33:36.129
I'm not saying a word to you
guys until my lawyer gets here.

33:36.131 --> 33:37.663
I didn't ask you any questions.

33:37.665 --> 33:39.298
Did our guest show up yet?

33:39.300 --> 33:41.267
Actually,
I was just gonna check.

33:46.340 --> 33:48.140
Yes.

33:48.142 --> 33:50.008
Our guest did show up.

33:50.010 --> 33:51.210
I don't know him.

33:51.212 --> 33:53.111
I never talked to that man
before in my life.

33:53.113 --> 33:55.280
I'm sorry, I thought
we weren't talking to you.

33:55.282 --> 33:56.748
You were waiting
for your lawyer.

33:56.750 --> 33:58.483
Forget the lawyer.
I'm telling you,

33:58.485 --> 33:59.918
I do not know that man.
And I damn sure

33:59.920 --> 34:01.887
don't know anything
about what happened to his son.

34:01.889 --> 34:03.088
Huh.
But you know

34:03.090 --> 34:04.022
who he is, right?

34:04.024 --> 34:05.724
Of course I know who he is.

34:05.726 --> 34:07.358
I've seen Potter on TV.

34:07.360 --> 34:09.360
Oh, you know him a
lot more than that.

34:09.362 --> 34:11.295
You were in his
youth at risk camp,

34:11.297 --> 34:13.665
the one that his group
sponsors, when you were a kid.

34:13.667 --> 34:15.966
In fact, he kept you
out of prison as a kid.

34:15.967 --> 34:17.368
So?

34:17.370 --> 34:19.370
So, if you know Reverend Potter,

34:19.371 --> 34:20.405
you must know he's got

34:20.407 --> 34:22.172
a lot of people behind him.
All right,

34:22.175 --> 34:24.074
cool, yeah.
The reverend looked out for me.

34:24.077 --> 34:25.810
But that was a long time ago.

34:25.812 --> 34:27.476
What has he done for me lately?

34:27.478 --> 34:29.112
Wow. You know,
they say gratitude

34:29.114 --> 34:30.748
is the shortest-lived
of all emotions.

34:30.750 --> 34:32.248
Except the
rev's still got

34:32.251 --> 34:33.550
a lot of friends over at Rikers

34:33.552 --> 34:35.753
who haven't forgotten
what he tried to do for them.

34:35.755 --> 34:37.755
In fact, if somebody
was to do something

34:37.757 --> 34:40.858
to hurt the reverend's kids
and then show up in Rikers,

34:40.860 --> 34:42.993
I would guess they'd
probably have a serious problem

34:42.995 --> 34:43.960
on their hands.

34:43.962 --> 34:44.661
You think so?

34:44.663 --> 34:45.829
I know so.

34:45.831 --> 34:46.929
You can't threaten me like that.

34:46.931 --> 34:49.199
I'm sorry, we're
not talking to you.

34:49.201 --> 34:51.101
You're waiting for your lawyer.

34:57.876 --> 34:59.643
Might be a while.

35:06.985 --> 35:09.318
Get me a damn pen and paper.

35:09.320 --> 35:10.854
I'm ready to start writing.

35:10.856 --> 35:12.455
Your lawyer's not here yet.

35:12.457 --> 35:13.389
I don't care.

35:13.391 --> 35:15.358
I want to put things my way.

35:19.029 --> 35:21.063
You guys got to do me a favor.

35:21.065 --> 35:22.164
What's that?

35:22.166 --> 35:25.934
Tell the rev
I did not know it was his kid.

35:28.473 --> 35:31.707
We're not here
to do you any favors.

35:46.991 --> 35:49.391
We got him.

35:49.393 --> 35:52.026
Who is it?

35:52.028 --> 35:55.229
The actual shooter
was one Dante Micklewhite.

35:55.231 --> 35:57.031
Age 15.

35:57.033 --> 35:59.867
Did he know my son?

35:59.869 --> 36:01.436
No.

36:01.438 --> 36:04.706
He was part of a gang
run by Omar Davis.

36:04.708 --> 36:08.976
The murder was, uh,
his initiation into the crew.

36:08.978 --> 36:11.612
It was...

36:11.614 --> 36:13.747
Senseless.

36:13.749 --> 36:15.516
Yes.

36:15.518 --> 36:18.419
I knew Omar Davis.

36:18.421 --> 36:21.823
Well, it turns out he was
in one of your at risk programs

36:21.825 --> 36:24.191
back in the day.

36:24.193 --> 36:27.428
If I never have to swallow
another piece of irony

36:27.430 --> 36:30.664
this lifetime,
that'd be just fine.

36:30.666 --> 36:32.933
I hear you.

36:32.935 --> 36:35.001
Well, you do and you don't.

36:35.003 --> 36:37.838
Oh, no. I do.

36:37.840 --> 36:39.806
My son

36:39.808 --> 36:43.143
died at the hand
of a crooked cop.

36:45.314 --> 36:47.680
I didn't know that.

36:47.682 --> 36:49.816
No reason you would.

36:49.818 --> 36:51.718
Anyway,
I don't want to keep you.

36:51.720 --> 36:55.955
I just wanted you to hear it
from me as soon as I got it.

36:55.957 --> 36:57.390
Thank you.

36:57.392 --> 36:59.359
And to Detective Reagan.

37:00.194 --> 37:03.028
I'll pass that along.

37:03.030 --> 37:04.296
Commissioner.

37:04.298 --> 37:07.166
Yeah.

37:07.168 --> 37:12.504
Would you and Detective Reagan
consider attending the funeral?

37:16.244 --> 37:18.677
You can let us know
in the morning.

37:18.679 --> 37:21.747
I can let you know right now.

37:21.749 --> 37:24.716
We'd be honored.

37:35.061 --> 37:38.129
I'll see you there.

37:53.146 --> 37:56.147
Sometimes we just have to put
our personal feelings aside.

37:56.149 --> 37:59.750
So, what, you're just gonna take
a time-out from being enemies?

37:59.752 --> 38:01.452
Not enemies, exactly.

38:01.454 --> 38:03.320
More like agree to disagree.
Actually,

38:03.322 --> 38:05.689
just to disagree, since we
were never really offered

38:05.691 --> 38:07.858
the choice whether
to agree or not.

38:07.860 --> 38:09.126
Good point.

38:09.128 --> 38:10.928
But you're being big about it,
so good for you.

38:10.930 --> 38:12.129
Yeah.

38:12.131 --> 38:14.432
Good for you. And
there's no real choice.

38:14.434 --> 38:15.999
The Potters lost their son.

38:16.001 --> 38:17.935
There's no sides
to a tragedy.

38:17.937 --> 38:19.202
But it
takes two sides

38:19.204 --> 38:21.671
to agree to a truce.

38:21.673 --> 38:23.740
And if that's
what's happening here,

38:23.742 --> 38:26.376
it's something
to be grateful for.

38:26.378 --> 38:28.278
Amen. Right?

38:28.280 --> 38:29.579
Amen. Right.

38:29.581 --> 38:31.348
So, are you guys just
gonna go back to being enemies

38:31.350 --> 38:32.782
or whatever
on Monday morning?

38:32.784 --> 38:34.351
Probably.

38:34.353 --> 38:36.018
Maybe not <i>so</i> much.

38:36.020 --> 38:37.320
Hopefully.

38:37.322 --> 38:40.723
He's, uh, asked me
to speak at the service.

38:40.725 --> 38:42.091
That's a big step.

38:42.093 --> 38:43.426
Or maybe it's just that he knows

38:43.428 --> 38:46.295
that we know
what they're going through.

38:47.933 --> 38:49.532
What are you gonna say, Dad?

38:52.103 --> 38:53.735
“And even in our sleep,

38:53.737 --> 38:58.474
“pain that cannot forget falls
drop by drop upon the heart,

38:58.476 --> 39:02.178
and in our own despair...”

39:03.881 --> 39:07.483
“...against our will,

39:07.485 --> 39:12.955
comes wisdom to us
by the awful grace of God.”

39:15.092 --> 39:17.593
St. Matthew?

39:17.595 --> 39:18.794
Shakespeare?

39:18.796 --> 39:22.531
It's Aeschylus.

39:23.968 --> 39:26.901
I was... I was gonna say it
at Joe's funeral,

39:26.903 --> 39:28.336
but, um...

39:28.338 --> 39:31.339
I couldn't, at the time.

39:34.277 --> 39:37.278
Now you can?

39:39.749 --> 39:41.949
I think so.

39:46.322 --> 39:48.789
I hope so.
