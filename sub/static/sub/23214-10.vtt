"Dingos After Dark."

09:12.920 --> 09:14.420
Siri, take us to San Diego.
-No --

09:14.420 --> 09:15.920
Recalculating route.

09:15.920 --> 09:18.210
Siri, it's me or him.

09:18.210 --> 09:19.920
I don't understand.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.040
You really want Siri
to make that choice?

09:22.040 --> 09:23.960
I don't.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.960
She's obviously
gonna choose you.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.880
Can you please have her
play Solange?

09:27.880 --> 09:28.670
Yeah, I got you.

09:28.670 --> 09:30.380
Siri, play some Daft Punk.

09:30.380 --> 09:31.670

09:34.750 --> 09:36.040
Oh, hi. Sorry.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.290
This drink isn't right.

09:38.290 --> 09:39.710
Okay.
What's wrong with it?

09:39.710 --> 09:41.080
It tastes funny.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.080
Well, what are
you looking for?

09:43.080 --> 09:45.880
A drink that
doesn't taste funny.

09:45.880 --> 09:48.540
Fine,
I'll get you a new one.

09:54.210 --> 09:56.460
-Nothing.

09:56.460 --> 09:57.830
Am I crazy for sending
the drink back?

09:57.830 --> 09:59.830
You often send
your drink back.

09:59.830 --> 10:01.790
So, what, am I not supposed to
get what I paid for?

10:05.880 --> 10:07.620
Okay, look,
I'm just gonna say it.

10:07.620 --> 10:08.920
We're all friends here,
right?

10:08.920 --> 10:11.000
We can be honest
with each other.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.380
Do you think this might have
something to do with the fact

10:14.380 --> 10:15.880
that black guys are --

10:15.880 --> 10:16.830
Don't!

10:16.830 --> 10:19.790
No, no, Ana, it's fine.
We're all friends.

10:19.790 --> 10:21.250
We're not that close.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.790
You're about to insinuate
that this is why black guys

10:23.790 --> 10:25.210
aren't checkin' for us,
aren't you?

10:25.210 --> 10:28.080
See, normally I would
call you a bitch right now,

10:28.080 --> 10:31.920
but since you're questioning
my attitude, I will hold it.

10:31.920 --> 10:35.670
And honestly, Nomi, no one
returns more drinks than you.

10:35.670 --> 10:38.170
Oh my God,
taste that.

10:38.170 --> 10:39.830
No, I'm serious,
taste it.

10:39.830 --> 10:42.210
I want to record your face
so that I can show you

10:42.210 --> 10:44.540
what it looks like
when you drink dog piss.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Well, it's like what Jazz said,
I'm paying for a drink.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.960
Should I not get
what I paid for?

10:50.960 --> 10:52.960
Exactly. But when you do it,
it's how you act.

10:52.960 --> 10:55.080
And when I do it,
it's how black girls act.

10:55.080 --> 10:58.710
Right. We're difficult, sassy,
full of attitude.

10:58.710 --> 11:02.330
I mean, for me, you're basically
rattling off a club sandwich.

11:02.330 --> 11:04.920
What? I can't do
the passive chick.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.960
I see that
with my mom and pops.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.880
I need a little bit
of danger.

11:08.880 --> 11:12.290
Like, maybe I got to sleep
with one eye open

11:12.290 --> 11:14.960
or wonder if she's gonna throw
a toaster in the shower.

11:14.960 --> 11:18.210
That is sexy as hell to me.

11:18.210 --> 11:21.880

lost your hero status.

and here's the deal -- we're
in college, and I'm single.

19:08.250 --> 19:10.250
It's not that deep.
White girls holla at me.

19:10.250 --> 19:13.620
Mexican girls holla at me.
We kick it sometimes.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.460
How is that better
than "Because I can"?

19:16.460 --> 19:18.330
I mean, what was I
supposed to say?

19:18.330 --> 19:20.460
Hold on one second.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.380
All of it
caught me off guard.

19:22.380 --> 19:25.250
I'm in my bag,
got a couple drinks.

19:25.250 --> 19:27.290
They just played "Mask Off"
for the third time.

19:27.290 --> 19:30.250
And then you come in through
with the interrogation.

19:30.250 --> 19:34.420
Yeah, that's my sister -- face
of an angel, heart of an MS-13.

19:34.420 --> 19:36.250
Yeah, I can see she has
that gear in her.

19:36.250 --> 19:39.420
Look, I don't want her
or you or anyone thinking

19:39.420 --> 19:40.790
I don't like black girls

19:40.790 --> 19:42.920
'cause that's just not
the real.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.380
I don't know where y'all from,
but I'm from Queens.

19:45.380 --> 19:47.620
When I came here,
it was a whole new world.

19:47.620 --> 19:51.040
Everybody's so open, so I
figured I'd do the same.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.420
Yeah, that's what
I keep telling her.

19:53.420 --> 19:54.920
It's not so bad to open up.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.210
Yeah.
I'm Doug, by the way.

19:57.210 --> 20:00.080
I'm Jazz.

20:00.080 --> 20:03.830
♪♪

20:03.830 --> 20:05.500
I'ma go to class.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.290
Take good notes, girl.

20:09.290 --> 20:14.500
So, Doug, you don't happen to
rock climb, do you?

20:14.500 --> 20:16.500
Nah,
these are Air Max 97s.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.460
I see.

20:17.460 --> 20:19.540
I can't do that with these.
-I feel you.

20:24.040 --> 20:25.880
Dude, I hate to admit it,
but Luca was right.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.670
I have a clear preference
for light-skinned girls.

20:27.670 --> 20:29.120
I -- This is not a good look.

20:29.120 --> 20:32.250
Whoa. Who's that? She is by far
the star of the show.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.210
Dude, fall back.
That's my mom.

20:34.210 --> 20:35.540
Okay?

20:35.540 --> 20:37.210
Yo, wait a minute.

20:39.170 --> 20:40.540
Huh?

20:40.540 --> 20:42.080
What?

20:42.080 --> 20:43.540
What?

20:43.540 --> 20:45.830
You don't have a thing
for light-skinned girls.

20:45.830 --> 20:48.420
You have a thing
for your mom.

20:48.420 --> 20:49.380
Huh?

20:49.380 --> 20:51.330
So, is your dad still
in the picture or...
