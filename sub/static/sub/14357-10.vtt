<i>El Gato!</i>

00:30.151 --> 00:32.706
<b>2x10- "Si"</b>

00:40.356 --> 00:41.440
He did it!

00:41.566 --> 00:43.275
Ja. Ha!

00:43.401 --> 00:47.196
"Puss in Boots is the best.
He's also very handsome."

00:47.279 --> 00:49.323
It doesn't rhyme but I don't care.

00:49.407 --> 00:51.033
I feel this thing inside me

00:51.116 --> 00:53.411
like I do not hate him so much anymore.

00:53.494 --> 00:55.079
Hey. What's all the hubbub?

00:55.204 --> 00:57.456
Oh, that wonderful Puss in the Boots

00:57.540 --> 01:00.418
has restored the protective spell
of San Lorenzo.

01:00.501 --> 01:02.044
Whoa!

01:02.127 --> 01:04.962
Pickles for everyone! On the house.

01:05.964 --> 01:07.674
Look! It's him.

01:08.092 --> 01:11.887
Friends, I, Puss in Boots,

01:11.970 --> 01:15.682
have restored the protective spell
of San Lorenzo at long last.

01:15.766 --> 01:17.268
In fulfilling my promise,

01:17.351 --> 01:21.313
I have become the greatest legend
in the history of legends.

01:23.566 --> 01:25.943
Puss! Puss! Puss!

01:26.110 --> 01:30.781
<i>Puss! Puss! Puss! Puss!
Puss! Puss!</i>

01:30.948 --> 01:32.866
<i>Three cheers for Puss!</i>

01:34.076 --> 01:38.163
<i>Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray!</i>

01:38.247 --> 01:40.082
<i>Hip hip...
- Hooray!</i>

01:44.378 --> 01:47.005
Babieca, you are a unicorn again!

01:47.089 --> 01:49.716
That's right. First I wasn't, then I was.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.219
Then I wasn't again, and now I am again.

01:52.303 --> 01:53.596
Hey, look!

01:54.430 --> 01:56.098
<i>That looks just like me.</i>

01:56.557 --> 01:57.433
Sure does.

01:57.516 --> 02:01.019
Now, do you wanna meet
the man in the moon?

02:01.103 --> 02:02.104
You bet I do.

02:02.688 --> 02:04.398
This is the greatest day of my life!

02:05.023 --> 02:10.821
<i>Puss! Puss! Puss!
Puss! Puss! Puss! Puss!</i>

02:10.946 --> 02:15.326
<i>Puss! Puss! Puss!
Puss! Puss!</i>

02:15.909 --> 02:17.453
Puss!
- Hm?

02:19.955 --> 02:23.668
Uh... Oh, yes, yes,
it was like I was saying,

02:23.750 --> 02:26.128
today will be the day
that I fulfill my promise

02:26.211 --> 02:29.465
and finally restore the protective spell
of San Lorenzo.

02:29.548 --> 02:32.050
Ha! We have heard that before.

02:32.134 --> 02:34.720
Yes, only today, it is true.

02:34.803 --> 02:38.015
Artephius! The final piece
of missing treasure.

02:38.098 --> 02:39.808
Yes, my lord.

02:39.891 --> 02:43.395
Are you ready to witness
my greatest act of heroism ever?

02:43.479 --> 02:45.189
Heroism?

02:45.272 --> 02:47.816
You are just fixing the problem
you created.

02:47.899 --> 02:51.737
Please. Hold your applause
until after his heroic deed.

02:51.820 --> 02:54.573
No, Uli. SeÃ±ora Zapata is right.

02:54.657 --> 02:58.160
Breaking San Lorenzo's spell
was the greatest mistake I ever made,

02:58.243 --> 03:00.912
and I will bear that burden
until I set it right.

03:00.996 --> 03:02.831
Which I will do! Now!

03:30.275 --> 03:32.319
O mighty Mage Sino,

03:32.403 --> 03:34.279
we have returned your treasure.

03:34.363 --> 03:37.533
The debt is paid.
Sincerely, Puss in Boots.

03:45.583 --> 03:47.334
<i>Shouldn't something happen?</i>

03:47.918 --> 03:50.462
Oh, you bet.
When all the treasure is returned,

03:50.546 --> 03:54.759
that should turn Sino's eye from angry red
to pretty blue.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.011
Hm. Maybe if I just...

04:00.889 --> 04:02.099
There.

04:14.653 --> 04:16.113
Hey! Tall creepy statue!

04:16.196 --> 04:18.531
Look! The last piece of treasure!

04:18.616 --> 04:20.701
Now, change your eye back to blue!

04:22.160 --> 04:24.413
One moment. Not to worry.

04:27.958 --> 04:31.128
Maybe the statue is broken.

04:32.546 --> 04:35.466
I just do not understand.
Why am I being punished?

04:35.549 --> 04:38.427
We did everything we were supposed to.
- Mm-hmm.

04:38.510 --> 04:41.263
I swore a sacred vow
to protect San Lorenzo

04:41.346 --> 04:43.181
and return her to her former glory.

04:43.265 --> 04:44.683
And I intend to do so.

04:44.767 --> 04:47.269
Eh. Your heart is in the right place.

04:47.352 --> 04:48.771
Yes, of course it is.

04:48.854 --> 04:50.272
This town and the people in it

04:50.355 --> 04:51.857
are all that matters to me.
- Ow!

04:51.940 --> 04:54.777
Also, quick question,
what suits a Statue Me better,

04:54.860 --> 04:55.986
marble or obsidian?

04:56.069 --> 04:59.197
Marble is more durable,
but obsidian is more dramatic.

04:59.281 --> 05:01.533
Hey! Whee!

05:01.659 --> 05:03.201
A thought just occurred to me.

05:04.870 --> 05:08.582
Maybe the orb wasn't the last piece
of missing treasure.

05:08.666 --> 05:09.916
Maybe there's more.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.085
No, no. I refuse to believe that.

05:12.169 --> 05:13.337
No more treasure.

05:13.420 --> 05:15.714
Yeah, well, there must be more treasure
out there.

05:15.798 --> 05:18.550
It's a shame too, because the scroll
spoke of a great doom...

05:18.634 --> 05:19.510
<i>Ow!</i>

05:19.593 --> 05:22.847
...that would coincide with the eclipse,
which is only three days away.

05:24.973 --> 05:28.268
Well, then. If there is treasure
to be found, I will find it at once.

05:28.352 --> 05:30.646
I will set things right
if it is the last thing I do.

05:30.729 --> 05:32.189
That's the spirit!

05:32.272 --> 05:34.733
Then they will build me a statue so grand,

05:34.817 --> 05:37.986
people will do the bathroom in their pants
when they see it.

05:42.407 --> 05:44.117
Finish translating that spell at once.

05:44.201 --> 05:46.119
By the time you have completed your task,

05:46.203 --> 05:49.247
I will have found the last
of the missing treasure.

05:49.832 --> 05:50.916
<i>Ow!</i>

06:01.051 --> 06:02.636
Toby, what are you doing?

06:02.720 --> 06:04.889
Helping you read
through the treasure list-y thing.

06:04.971 --> 06:07.140
'Cause I'm a better helper than Uli.

06:07.224 --> 06:10.227
That is not how a squire helps his knight
with his reading.

06:10.310 --> 06:13.731
Oh, really?
- Ja. This is how it is done.

06:13.814 --> 06:17.902
I'm reading harder, Puss.
- Nein. I am.

06:17.984 --> 06:20.571
That is enough! Both of you!
Time out, now!

06:20.654 --> 06:23.908
I apologize, Herr Boots,
but I am just so excited

06:23.990 --> 06:26.243
you are so close to fulfilling
your destiny.

06:26.326 --> 06:28.662
Yeah, what he said. But better.

06:28.746 --> 06:30.247
Not close enough, I'm afraid.

06:30.330 --> 06:34.167
This inventory will take forever
to get through. Unless...

06:34.251 --> 06:35.836
Whoa! Unless what?

06:35.920 --> 06:38.004
No, it is too dangerous.

06:38.088 --> 06:41.258
But I thought nothing was too dangerous
for Herr Boots.

06:41.341 --> 06:44.970
True. But I warn you,
this could kill us all.

06:45.053 --> 06:46.263
What are you gonna do?

06:46.346 --> 06:49.224
I am going to employ an ancient
secret technique

06:49.307 --> 06:52.519
I learned from the mysterious monks
in the Far East.

06:52.603 --> 06:56.648
It is known as... speed reading.

06:57.733 --> 06:59.985
The miracles never stop mit you.

07:10.036 --> 07:12.163
Oh. Aaaah!

07:20.756 --> 07:21.715
Puss!

07:25.636 --> 07:26.720
Is he dead?

07:26.804 --> 07:29.598
Felina! The final piece of treasure.

07:29.681 --> 07:30.849
I know what it is.

07:30.933 --> 07:32.601
What is it? Is it bacon?

07:32.684 --> 07:36.438
It is a single gold coin.
One I recognize for its strange date:

07:36.521 --> 07:40.275
1829, hundreds of years in the future.

07:40.358 --> 07:43.278
And this future coin and I have a past.

07:43.361 --> 07:45.363
<i>It is fitting that the key
to restoring the spell</i>

07:45.447 --> 07:47.992
<i>is the same piece of treasure
that broke the spell</i>

07:48.074 --> 07:51.244
<i>when someone whose name I cannot
recall took it as a souvenir.</i>

07:51.829 --> 07:55.749
Hmm...
I wonder what happened to that coin.

08:41.086 --> 08:43.587
1829!

08:43.672 --> 08:46.884
At last, I have found the magical coin
from the future

08:46.967 --> 08:48.886
that is the final piece of my latest,

08:48.969 --> 08:52.931
very much not-insane plot
to rule the world.

08:53.015 --> 08:55.809
And to think, they called me crazy.

08:55.893 --> 08:57.602
They're the crazy ones!

09:08.780 --> 09:11.992
Oh! I am so excited to discover
the coin's whereabouts.

09:12.076 --> 09:13.785
Where do you think it is?

09:13.869 --> 09:16.663
Why, it probably ended up
someplace harmless,

09:16.747 --> 09:20.458
like inside a walnut,
or atop a friendly snail's shell or... Huh?

09:23.420 --> 09:26.423
The Duchess' evil lair.

09:28.508 --> 09:31.219
Seriously, what is it with the Duchess
and lightning?

09:31.344 --> 09:34.305
Ha. She is no match for you.
- No match!

09:34.389 --> 09:36.767
Your muscles are like mountain boulders.

09:36.850 --> 09:37.935
I am a rock!

09:38.060 --> 09:40.311
Your hands are like deadly serpents.

09:41.939 --> 09:47.652
Your eyes, like jade pools gently lapping
at the feet on a luxurious holiday.

09:47.736 --> 09:48.946
What was that last part?

09:49.029 --> 09:51.949
Ooh. It was probably the wind. Let's go.

10:01.291 --> 10:03.877
All right, we go in, grab the coin,
and hurry home.

10:03.961 --> 10:05.879
Und then they build your statue?

10:05.963 --> 10:09.257
Yes! Tell me, do you think this new design
is too garish?

10:09.967 --> 10:12.510
It is more beautiful than heaven.

10:12.594 --> 10:14.596
Good. On three.

10:14.679 --> 10:18.391
Uno, dos, three! Whoa! Wow, what?

10:19.476 --> 10:22.938
Who dares enter my... Oh, it's you.

10:23.730 --> 10:25.607
Well, let's get this over with.

10:32.864 --> 10:36.618
Hello? Artephius?
Have you by any chance seen Toby? Oh, my!

10:42.916 --> 10:46.336
Artephius, are you... all right?

10:47.087 --> 10:49.923
Ooh. Hiya, Dulcinea.
Come to check on the spell, I bet.

10:50.007 --> 10:52.843
It took me all night
and 42 cups of Valerian root tea,

10:52.926 --> 10:55.720
but I did it.
I translated the whole darn thing.

10:55.804 --> 10:58.140
Valerian root?
Doesn't that just make you sleep?

10:58.223 --> 10:59.224
Oh, it sure does.

10:59.307 --> 11:01.518
I had to balance it out with
43 cups of coffee.

11:01.643 --> 11:06.648
Hah. You thought you could keep me down,
tea, but you can't. I'm a mad dog!

11:10.819 --> 11:11.736
Anyway...

11:13.404 --> 11:14.990
Oh, this is so exciting.

11:15.073 --> 11:16.783
The spell is finally gonna be restored.

11:16.867 --> 11:18.827
I was starting to believe
it was never gonna happen.

11:18.910 --> 11:20.620
I don't know though.

11:20.704 --> 11:23.623
Something about this spell
just seems fishy to me.

11:23.707 --> 11:24.749
Real fishy.

11:24.833 --> 11:27.418
You know, sometimes
when those we care about

11:27.502 --> 11:29.880
are expecting a lot from us,
it can make us feel...

11:29.963 --> 11:32.007
Gassy?
- Nervous.

11:33.091 --> 11:36.636
"When yourself you find in doubt,
sing a song and belt it out."

11:36.720 --> 11:38.471
Oh. No, wait, that wasn't the one.

11:39.556 --> 11:41.975
"Turtle, turtle, turtle dove, gift..."

11:42.059 --> 11:43.393
Wait. No. What?

11:43.476 --> 11:45.812
"Little Sparrow Fancy Pants..."

11:45.896 --> 11:46.730
Ugh.

11:46.855 --> 11:49.733
Okay, the point is
you are a wonderful alchemist

11:49.816 --> 11:51.401
and you have nothing to be worried about.

11:51.484 --> 11:56.406
Hm. Well, maybe. But this spell uses
a lot of Arcanum Corallinum,

11:56.489 --> 11:57.866
which, as everyone knows,

11:57.949 --> 12:01.703
is typically used in dark spells
of deceit and malice.

12:01.786 --> 12:03.997
Really? Hm. Okay, maybe
actually you should...

12:04.081 --> 12:07.000
And the scroll smells like tea.

12:07.084 --> 12:10.170
Should magic scrolls smell like tea?
Is that normal?

12:10.295 --> 12:12.881
It's the tea! It wants revenge!

12:12.964 --> 12:15.175
Danger! Danger! Danger!

12:15.259 --> 12:17.261
Alert the constabulary.

12:21.681 --> 12:23.600
Die, you miserable cat!

12:26.811 --> 12:29.898
Hip, hop, hop, hop, hop.

12:32.817 --> 12:35.320
Oh!
- Now give me my coin.

12:35.403 --> 12:37.155
No!

12:37.239 --> 12:39.449
Leave Puss alone!

12:40.617 --> 12:42.160
<i>Toby, what are you doing?</i>

12:42.244 --> 12:44.329
Proving to you that I'm the better squire.

12:44.454 --> 12:47.332
Everybody knows that I am Puss' squire.

12:47.415 --> 12:48.792
No, I am!

12:49.960 --> 12:51.920
No! Stop! Bad.

12:54.005 --> 12:56.174
Duchess, drop that coin.

12:56.925 --> 13:00.428
You mean this magical coin
that will allow me to power

13:00.511 --> 13:03.140
my amazing suit of magical armor?

13:03.223 --> 13:05.142
Yes. Precisely.

13:05.809 --> 13:06.768
With pleasure!

13:20.824 --> 13:22.242
Oh!

13:23.160 --> 13:25.329
Prepare to die, Puss in Boots!

13:30.292 --> 13:31.835
Did I hit someone?

13:31.918 --> 13:35.839
Nein. You have only succeeded
in making yourself appear foolish.

13:35.922 --> 13:38.342
Why is this thing so complicated?

13:38.424 --> 13:39.676
Distract her.

13:39.759 --> 13:42.346
Your squire accepts.
- But, but... Aw.

13:44.514 --> 13:47.058
Hello, you! Look at me over here.

13:47.142 --> 13:50.645
Do not concern yourself with
the goings-on of Puss in Boots.

13:54.899 --> 13:57.777
What are you doing? Stop that.

13:58.528 --> 14:00.905
Da. Look at my little hoofy legs.

14:00.989 --> 14:03.074
Listen to how they keep time.

14:05.410 --> 14:08.705
Give! Me! That! Coin!

14:09.164 --> 14:10.957
Stop! You're gonna break it.

14:18.464 --> 14:21.176
<i>I don't need the coin
to operate the suit.</i>

14:21.301 --> 14:22.427
<i>Just to turn it on.</i>

14:23.387 --> 14:25.180
But that is no fair.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.476
I kinda wanna go home.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.270
We are in complete agreement.

14:47.535 --> 14:49.329
<i>That was the last straw.</i>

14:49.413 --> 14:53.333
<i>I will have my revenge on San Lorenzo!</i>

14:58.546 --> 15:01.674
Oh.

15:02.717 --> 15:05.553
Hi, Puss. You missed...
- Yes, hello. No time. Duchess coming.

15:05.636 --> 15:07.347
But do not worry. I have it.
- Have what?

15:07.431 --> 15:11.517
The final piece of treasure.
Now, prepare your finest praise.

15:15.397 --> 15:16.814
Eh... Ugh!

15:19.734 --> 15:23.405
Ja, no, that was not nearly as dramatic
as I'd hoped.

15:28.159 --> 15:29.786
It worked. Artephius!

15:30.870 --> 15:33.039
I've returned every last piece
of treasure to the Treasure House

15:33.123 --> 15:35.292
and the Duchess is coming
and she has a giant magical suit of armor

15:35.375 --> 15:36.876
and have you finished translating
the spell yet?

15:36.960 --> 15:38.128
You bet.

15:38.211 --> 15:40.046
Eeeh! Huzzah!

15:40.130 --> 15:42.215
Now, restore that spell!

15:42.299 --> 15:43.967
Oh, silly Puss.

15:44.050 --> 15:48.846
Sure, I translated the spell,
but executing it is gonna take a while.

15:48.930 --> 15:51.766
What?
- I need to assemble ingredients,

15:51.849 --> 15:55.520
distill Arcanum Corallinum
from spirit of nitre, shave my legs,

15:55.603 --> 15:59.816
which isn't technically a part of the
process but grooming is important.

15:59.899 --> 16:01.901
I'd say I'm at least two days out.

16:09.409 --> 16:11.369
Hey, don't look so glum, chum.

16:11.453 --> 16:13.579
The eclipse is still two days away.

16:13.663 --> 16:14.998
Plenty of time.

16:15.081 --> 16:18.876
Though, too bad it sounds like
the Duchess is gonna destroy us anyway.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.628
No! I have worked too hard.

16:20.711 --> 16:23.507
If the spell cannot protect San Lorenzo,
I will.

16:23.589 --> 16:25.591
How you gonna do that?
- I do not know.

16:25.675 --> 16:26.717
Hm.

16:26.801 --> 16:30.805
Oh. That reminds me. The spell...
Something's fishy about it.

16:30.888 --> 16:33.391
I think it might not be what it seems.

16:33.475 --> 16:36.520
I must find a solution,
lest madness overtake me.

16:36.602 --> 16:39.022
Ah!
- Spells seem fishy all the time.

16:39.105 --> 16:43.401
It is quite common. Now, run along
and do the spell, magic man.

16:43.485 --> 16:45.945
What do you know about spells?
- Oh, every goaty man

16:46.029 --> 16:48.865
must learn basic alchemy
when we are goaty boys.

16:48.990 --> 16:50.867
Now go! Do it. Do it!

16:51.493 --> 16:54.329
I must protect the town. But how? I know!

16:54.412 --> 16:57.040
I will build a giant wall
around San Lorenzo.

16:57.123 --> 16:58.916
No, wait, that sounds crazy.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.128
Ah, yes, I will train a flock of eagles
to protect us.

17:02.212 --> 17:03.588
No, too much bird seed.

17:03.713 --> 17:05.006
Oh, oh! That is it!

17:05.089 --> 17:09.135
I will dig a protective moat around town
using the power of punching.

17:23.858 --> 17:27.194
Don't worry, Puss,
we'll figure something out.

17:28.530 --> 17:30.031
Ja. Together.

17:40.958 --> 17:44.629
<i>Hello, San Lorenzo!</i>

17:45.046 --> 17:46.631
Go!

17:49.926 --> 17:51.802
Duchess, I am in no mood for...

17:56.015 --> 17:57.975
Aaa! Ugh.

18:08.361 --> 18:10.447
Make the fightings on her, Puss.

18:14.618 --> 18:15.660
Aaaah!

18:20.582 --> 18:23.293
Ha. Another innocent saved by...

18:35.888 --> 18:36.889
Ha!

18:41.645 --> 18:42.895
Whoa, ooh!

18:46.941 --> 18:48.359
Whoa-oaaah.

18:50.945 --> 18:53.657
Goodbye, Puss.

18:55.492 --> 18:56.867
Huh? Oh!

18:59.996 --> 19:02.165
<i>San Lorenzo!</i>

19:02.248 --> 19:05.168
<i>I have returned!</i>

19:11.382 --> 19:12.592
Hmm.

19:21.934 --> 19:26.022
It is I, the Great Mage Sino.

19:29.192 --> 19:32.487
<i>Excuse me, but I was
about to smash my nemesis here.</i>

19:40.537 --> 19:43.122
Okay, well, so I'm just gonna go.

19:47.627 --> 19:50.129
That is precisely how
I would have vanquished her,

19:50.213 --> 19:51.673
O Great Mage Sino.

19:52.340 --> 19:55.635
I am Puss in Boots,
protector of San Lorenzo.

19:55.719 --> 19:58.638
I welcome ye. Thou. You.

20:01.807 --> 20:03.059
Um, yes. Well...

20:03.142 --> 20:06.521
You will be pleased to know that we are
almost ready to restore your spell.

20:06.604 --> 20:07.522
Huzzah!

20:08.105 --> 20:09.065
Restore it?

20:09.649 --> 20:12.235
Yes, but please, save your applause for...

20:12.318 --> 20:15.530
It was meant to last a thousand years!

20:15.613 --> 20:16.573
Who broke it?

20:20.410 --> 20:22.245
You broke my spell?

20:23.329 --> 20:26.541
Well, you see,
it is actually a very humorous story.

20:26.624 --> 20:28.167
<i>Puss in Boots!</i>

20:28.752 --> 20:32.088
For the crime of breaking
my protective spell,

20:32.171 --> 20:36.593
you are hereby banished
from San Lorenzo.

20:36.676 --> 20:38.720
<i>Forever!</i>

20:42.056 --> 20:43.391
Banished? But, O Great...

20:43.474 --> 20:46.686
The Great Mage Sino has spoken!

20:47.186 --> 20:49.313
But I can explain. I...

20:49.397 --> 20:52.983
Enough!
You put this town in danger.

20:53.067 --> 20:55.528
You put your friends in danger.

20:55.612 --> 20:59.240
And you are a bad kitty.

21:03.411 --> 21:05.121
No, he's not, Sino. You're...

21:05.204 --> 21:06.997
He is right.

21:07.957 --> 21:08.999
I am no hero.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.838
I have committed myself to protecting you,
but from what? My own mistake?

21:14.297 --> 21:16.507
No. I see this now.

21:18.635 --> 21:20.010
Sino is correct.

21:21.429 --> 21:24.056
I... must leave you.

21:30.396 --> 21:33.941
Amigos, you must learn
to get along in my absence.

21:34.024 --> 21:36.235
I will not be here
to glare at you anymore.

21:39.447 --> 21:42.199
You're just gonna leave without a fight?
That isn't like you.

21:42.283 --> 21:44.076
I cannot fight Sino.

21:44.160 --> 21:47.121
This is his town. I was just living in it.

21:47.913 --> 21:50.040
And ruining it.

21:53.628 --> 21:54.587
So that's it?

21:57.340 --> 21:58.675
You're just giving up?

22:02.303 --> 22:03.137
Fine.

22:04.472 --> 22:05.431
Then go.
