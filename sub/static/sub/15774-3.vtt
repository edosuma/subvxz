WEBVTT

00:01.301 --> 00:02.901
Hmm...

00:04.935 --> 00:07.203
What is taking you so long?

00:07.237 --> 00:10.706
You have the first turn.
You can put any word down.

00:13.009 --> 00:14.833
Don't rush me.

00:20.999 --> 00:22.999
Is "dogarf" a word?

00:23.033 --> 00:24.668
I'm not telling you.

00:24.702 --> 00:26.602
You're fun to play with.

00:26.636 --> 00:30.642
Is "fodgrf" a word?

00:30.677 --> 00:33.978
If you can't say it,
it's probably not a word.

00:34.013 --> 00:35.816
Ok, fine.

00:39.659 --> 00:40.927
"Darvog"?

00:40.961 --> 00:42.998
- What?
- I challenge.

00:43.032 --> 00:44.834
"Darvog" is a word.

00:44.869 --> 00:45.936
Use it in a sentence.

00:45.970 --> 00:48.709
I just did. "Darvog" is a word.

00:48.743 --> 00:49.944
That's a sentence.

00:49.979 --> 00:52.582
Do you not know
what a sentence is?

00:52.616 --> 00:54.517
Because if you don't know
what a sentence is,

00:54.551 --> 00:55.585
we shouldn't play.

00:55.620 --> 00:58.022
It would be like
playing with a child.

00:58.057 --> 01:01.327
You want something to eat?
I am darvogged.

01:23.657 --> 01:27.060
I just invented a new sandwich.

01:28.730 --> 01:32.633
I took peanut butter and
spread it on a piece of bread.

01:32.668 --> 01:35.705
And then, on the other
piece of bread,

01:35.739 --> 01:38.308
I put some jelly.

01:40.745 --> 01:44.083
I call it a jelly
and peanut butter sandwich,

01:44.117 --> 01:46.319
or a j&pb.

01:49.690 --> 01:53.126
Not great. Weird combination.

01:53.161 --> 01:55.095
Don't move.

01:55.129 --> 01:56.763
Why?

01:56.798 --> 01:58.065
Spider.

01:58.099 --> 02:00.067
Where? Where is it?

02:00.101 --> 02:02.136
Is it on me? Get it off me!

02:02.170 --> 02:03.904
Get out of the way!

02:03.939 --> 02:05.139
- Uhh huh huh!
- Where did it go?

02:05.173 --> 02:06.874
What did it look like?

02:06.908 --> 02:09.143
It was the biggest
spider I've ever seen.

02:09.176 --> 02:10.777
Ooh! Ooh!

02:10.812 --> 02:12.379
Uhh!

02:15.183 --> 02:16.516
What are you doing?

02:16.551 --> 02:17.752
I'm gonna kill it.

02:17.786 --> 02:20.922
Are you mad? You can't do that.

02:20.957 --> 02:24.160
You need to capture it
and take it outside...

02:24.194 --> 02:25.762
And then kill it.

02:25.796 --> 02:27.798
We don't want
that mess in here.

02:27.832 --> 02:29.165
The maid just cleaned.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.166
We don't have a maid.

02:30.201 --> 02:31.768
I meant you.

02:31.802 --> 02:34.170
Hey, guys! Uhh! Spider!

02:35.840 --> 02:37.074
Lola!

02:37.108 --> 02:38.276
Oh, did you like that lamp?

02:38.310 --> 02:39.878
Let me get you another one.

02:39.912 --> 02:41.146
Seriously, it's no problem.
I can go right now.

02:41.180 --> 02:43.215
I'm 8 hours early
for our date anyway.

02:43.249 --> 02:45.017
I don't see the spider.

02:45.051 --> 02:46.185
Oh, I missed him.

02:46.219 --> 02:47.553
He could be anywhere!

02:47.587 --> 02:48.888
You guys should be careful.

02:48.923 --> 02:50.190
I heard this story once
about a spider

02:50.224 --> 02:51.859
that crawled inside
this man's ear

02:51.893 --> 02:53.127
and laid its eggs in there,

02:53.161 --> 02:55.229
and the spider babies
ate his brain.

02:56.098 --> 02:58.834
Well, time to go lamp shopping!

02:58.868 --> 03:02.237
You know what, I should go
help Lola with that lamp.

03:02.272 --> 03:05.007
Lamps can be pretty tricky.

03:05.042 --> 03:08.211
Wait for me! I'm not getting
killed by a spider today!

03:13.952 --> 03:16.254
A j&pb? I think
that sounds good.

03:16.288 --> 03:17.856
I invented a sandwich once.

03:17.890 --> 03:19.792
You take a piece of bread,
a piece of cheese,

03:19.826 --> 03:21.160
a bunch of ice cream,
a little more bread,

03:21.194 --> 03:23.162
some fish sticks,
a little syrup,

03:23.196 --> 03:24.898
and then the heel of the bread.

03:26.367 --> 03:28.168
I call it a darvog.

03:28.202 --> 03:31.872
Ah! I knew that was a word.

03:33.975 --> 03:36.210
You can't do anything until
he's been missing for 24 hours?

03:36.244 --> 03:39.280
But this is an emergency!
You're the police!

03:39.314 --> 03:42.250
What if something
terrible's happened to him?

03:42.284 --> 03:45.087
No, you calm down!

03:49.326 --> 03:51.460
I can't stand it!

03:52.963 --> 03:54.898
We're looking for a lamp.

03:54.932 --> 03:56.233
Tosh is missing!

03:56.267 --> 03:57.935
Well, we're not
looking for a tosh.

03:57.969 --> 03:59.971
We're looking for a lamp.

04:00.005 --> 04:01.272
What's a tosh?

04:01.306 --> 04:03.207
Tosh, my dear friend!

04:03.242 --> 04:06.278
He went to mail a letter,
but he never came back!

04:07.880 --> 04:10.215
Oh, dear. How long
has he been gone?

04:10.250 --> 04:11.784
10 minutes!

04:11.818 --> 04:13.953
Oh, poor thing.

04:13.988 --> 04:17.290
We're never apart. I just know something
terrible has happened to him!

04:17.325 --> 04:18.959
11 minutes! Tosh!

04:18.993 --> 04:21.327
That's the worst thing
I've ever heard.

04:21.362 --> 04:25.765
When I heard about this guy who had a spider
lay babies in his ear and eat his brain.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.302
Oh!

04:32.406 --> 04:34.874
Tears won't bring
your friend back.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.309
Right now, time is our enemy.

04:37.344 --> 04:41.314
In the case of an abduction,
every second counts.

04:41.348 --> 04:42.915
Listen to me.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.251
If we don't find
your friend soon,

04:45.285 --> 04:49.888
the chances are, you will
never see him again.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.559
Oh, sorry.

04:55.961 --> 04:57.996
May I?

04:58.030 --> 04:59.264
We'll take your case.

04:59.298 --> 05:01.867
Oh, are you private detectives?

05:01.901 --> 05:05.337
No, but I can't go home until bugs
takes care of that giant spider,

05:05.372 --> 05:08.307
and this seems like a decent way
to kill some time.

05:08.341 --> 05:11.077
Now, can you give us a general
physical description of the victim?

05:11.111 --> 05:12.311
Victim?!

05:12.345 --> 05:13.746
Hey! The clock... it's ticking.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.281
All right.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.984
High cheekbones,
big expressive eyes,

05:19.019 --> 05:20.353
athletic build.

05:20.387 --> 05:23.089
Oh, no, wait! That one's me.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.424
This is Tosh.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.692
What's his height?

05:25.726 --> 05:27.293
About 9 1/2 inches tall.

05:27.328 --> 05:28.862
Weight?

05:28.896 --> 05:30.930
Now, he'll tell you
he's 3/4 of a pound,

05:30.965 --> 05:32.499
but between you, me,
and the fencepost...

05:32.533 --> 05:35.435
He's at least a pound,
but he carries it well.

05:35.469 --> 05:39.039
It's gonna be ok. Believe me, I have
a sixth sense about these things.

05:39.073 --> 05:42.308
I've got sight, I've got hearing,
I've got taste, I've got smell.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.577
- What is the other one?
- Touch?

05:44.612 --> 05:47.981
Oh, thanks. I'm flattered, but I'm
trying to think of the other sense.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.316
Whatever it is, I've got it.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.385
But the important one
is my sixth sense:

05:52.420 --> 05:54.354
My sense of humor.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.423
Boo brr boo bbb boo!

05:56.457 --> 06:01.328
Bbb bboo ddoo doo dooo pplll!

06:01.362 --> 06:03.965
Mm mmew!

06:03.999 --> 06:08.103
I guarantee you
we will find your friend.

06:08.137 --> 06:10.372
But just in case we don't, we'll
go ahead and take the lamp now

06:10.406 --> 06:13.275
so it's not awkward
later, you know.

06:18.381 --> 06:20.383
- Ohh!

06:20.417 --> 06:22.284
Lola, I can't talk right now.

06:22.318 --> 06:24.019
Oh, it's no problem.

06:24.053 --> 06:26.088
Just wanted you to know that daffy
and I are gonna be a little late.

06:26.122 --> 06:28.424
We're investigating
a missing person's case.

06:28.458 --> 06:29.791
Mmhmm.

06:29.826 --> 06:31.994
But the good news is
we got you a new lamp,

06:32.028 --> 06:34.496
and it looks exactly
like your old one,

06:34.531 --> 06:36.098
except it's a different color

06:36.132 --> 06:37.733
and the base is a
little wider... a lot wider.

06:37.767 --> 06:39.435
And the shade's different.
It's a weird shade.

06:39.469 --> 06:41.937
Aah!

06:41.972 --> 06:45.374
You know, you could at least
see it before you judge it.

06:45.409 --> 06:47.009
Unbelievable, that guy.

06:47.044 --> 06:49.645
Tell me about it.
Try living with him.

06:55.674 --> 06:57.208
What are we doing here again?

06:57.242 --> 06:59.177
We need to print up
missing person's flyers

06:59.211 --> 07:00.612
and put them up all over town,

07:00.646 --> 07:02.247
get the public involved.

07:02.281 --> 07:05.483
Plus, I get the 10% friends
and family discount here.

07:06.875 --> 07:07.745
Hey, guys!

07:07.754 --> 07:09.188
I don't have time to chitchat.

07:09.222 --> 07:11.790
Lola and I are in a race against
the clock to save a life.

07:11.824 --> 07:13.392
One of the gophers is missing.

07:13.426 --> 07:15.928
That's terrible.
How long has he been gone?

07:15.962 --> 07:17.229
- 15.
- Days?

07:17.263 --> 07:19.164
Minutes.

07:19.198 --> 07:21.266
And every second
I spend talking to you

07:21.300 --> 07:23.302
is a second I don't have.

07:23.336 --> 07:27.239
Now, do you have a dollar? I want to get
something from the vending machine.

07:27.273 --> 07:29.274
Thanks. Put it on my tab.

07:29.309 --> 07:30.476
Minus 10%.

07:33.980 --> 07:35.180
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

07:35.214 --> 07:37.515
Daffy and I
working side by side

07:37.550 --> 07:39.250
in an emotionally
charged environment?

07:39.285 --> 07:43.188
How easy it is for two people
bonded by a shared experience

07:43.222 --> 07:45.123
to become romantically
intertwined.

07:45.157 --> 07:49.895
I just want you to know that is not
gonna happen with me and daffy.

07:49.929 --> 07:51.296
Yeah.

07:51.330 --> 07:53.231
I wasn't worried.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.300
Ok, now that my blood
sugar's under control,

07:55.334 --> 07:57.936
we can focus on that flyer.

07:57.970 --> 07:59.270
Ooh! What about a reward?

07:59.305 --> 08:00.906
Good idea!

08:00.940 --> 08:03.942
But how do you put a dollar
amount on a human life?

08:03.976 --> 08:07.546
What am I talking about?
He's a gopher. Put 5 bucks.

08:07.580 --> 08:10.349
All right, now, let's put
the photo of Tosh here.

08:10.383 --> 08:11.650
We don't have a photo.

08:11.684 --> 08:13.986
What we also
don't have is time, Lola.

08:14.020 --> 08:16.855
That gopher's been gone
for 16 minutes.

08:16.890 --> 08:19.525
Maybe we should just
give up and go home.

08:20.994 --> 08:23.362
You don't mean that.

08:23.396 --> 08:26.232
And the spider's still there,
so, remember, you can't go home.

08:26.266 --> 08:28.000
You're right.

08:28.034 --> 08:30.169
We don't have a photo. We'll
have to draw a picture of him.

08:30.203 --> 08:35.374
Ooh! Ok, not to brag, but I have
been told I am a great artist.

08:35.408 --> 08:38.043
Oh, no, wait. I've been told
I'm a great flautist.

08:38.077 --> 08:40.345
No, that doesn't make sense.
I don't play the flaut.

08:40.379 --> 08:42.881
Maybe I've been told
something about Sauerkraut?

08:42.916 --> 08:44.316
Wait, what are we
talking about?

08:44.350 --> 08:45.818
Drawing the gopher.

08:45.852 --> 08:47.586
Ooh! I'll do it.

08:47.620 --> 08:50.256
Not to brag, but I've been
told I'm a great artist.

08:50.290 --> 08:53.359
Yes, ok... Shade that part...

08:53.393 --> 08:54.794
How's that?

08:54.828 --> 08:56.162
I don't know.

08:56.196 --> 08:58.364
Just those two
big teeth in front?

08:58.399 --> 08:59.999
He looks like a hillbilly.

09:00.033 --> 09:01.968
No offense.

09:02.002 --> 09:03.269
How about that?

09:03.304 --> 09:05.839
Better. What about
putting him in clothes?

09:05.873 --> 09:08.975
You know, like, maybe a white
outfit to signify his purity?

09:09.010 --> 09:11.344
Ooh, yeah, like he's
the innocent victim.

09:11.378 --> 09:13.312
I like that.

09:13.347 --> 09:16.282
Hmm. Now it's a little
too much white.

09:16.316 --> 09:19.351
Maybe he needs a pop of color.

09:19.386 --> 09:21.353
Ooh! That looks good.

09:21.388 --> 09:23.922
What about a hat?
Give him a little personality,

09:23.957 --> 09:26.558
like, "hey, look at me.
I got a hat on."

09:27.994 --> 09:29.560
Oh, yeah, that's our guy.

09:32.564 --> 09:35.299
Let's see what kind of spider
we're dealing with here.

09:35.334 --> 09:37.368
Uhh! This kind of
looks like him.

09:37.402 --> 09:39.370
"African sand spider.

09:39.404 --> 09:42.307
"The genus is sicarius,

09:42.341 --> 09:45.277
which is Latin for...
Murderer"?

09:46.846 --> 09:49.914
"The venom of the six-eyed
sand spider is highly toxic

09:49.949 --> 09:54.018
"and causes blood
vessel leakage

09:54.053 --> 09:58.390
tissue destruction,
and multi-organ breakdown"?

09:58.424 --> 09:59.491
Aah!

09:59.525 --> 10:01.559
Check out my n-new
driving gloves.

10:01.594 --> 10:03.361
W-why are you so jumpy?

10:03.396 --> 10:05.330
There's a killer spider
in the house.

10:05.364 --> 10:09.634
A kkiller spider?
You m-mean that one?

10:11.070 --> 10:12.404
W-what do we do?

10:12.439 --> 10:14.440
Just calm down.

10:14.474 --> 10:16.342
Let me get on your shoulders.

10:16.376 --> 10:19.078
II just had my jacket cleaned.

10:19.112 --> 10:21.413
Fine. Get on my shoulders.

10:21.447 --> 10:24.482
Oh! You're real solid,
aren't you?

10:24.517 --> 10:26.417
I... Don't know about this.

10:26.452 --> 10:28.653
You can do this, porky.

10:29.988 --> 10:32.456
Ddo we have to g-get so close?

10:32.490 --> 10:35.425
It's a spider. It's not
gonna jump on you.

10:35.460 --> 10:38.428
Aah! It's on my face!

10:38.462 --> 10:41.431
- Kill it!
- But it's on my face!

10:41.465 --> 10:43.433
Stab it!

10:43.467 --> 10:45.168
Get off me!

10:45.202 --> 10:46.402
Porky, you're panicking!

10:46.437 --> 10:50.073
There's a p-poisonous
spider on my face!

10:50.107 --> 10:51.674
Aaah!

10:54.078 --> 10:55.678
Aaah!

11:01.186 --> 11:04.455
Wwhat about my driving gloves?

11:04.489 --> 11:06.424
Really?

11:09.128 --> 11:11.496
This mailbox
was Tosh's destination.

11:11.530 --> 11:14.466
Did he make it? There's only
one way to find out:

11:14.500 --> 11:16.402
Dust for fingerprints.

11:16.436 --> 11:20.706
Right. Yes.
Dust for fingerprints.

11:26.612 --> 11:28.146
You know what,
we don't need fingerprints.

11:28.180 --> 11:29.481
Let's run some forensics.

11:29.515 --> 11:31.049
Right, forensics.

11:31.084 --> 11:33.718
Love forensics.
Big fan of forensics.

11:36.489 --> 11:39.424
Now that I think about it, all
we really need is a DNA sample.

11:39.458 --> 11:44.728
Right. One sample
of DNA coming up.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.500
You want to just crawl inside
and see if he's in there?

11:50.534 --> 11:52.369
Ooh! Fun!

11:58.542 --> 12:00.477
Nope! No gopher.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.512
Ooh, but there's tons
of mail in here.

12:02.546 --> 12:04.748
Oh, really?

12:07.318 --> 12:10.387
Hmm. Not as roomy
as I thought it would be.

12:11.556 --> 12:13.724
Nnow what do we do?

12:15.126 --> 12:17.494
Hey, boy!

12:17.528 --> 12:19.529
You're a good guard dog, right?

12:21.165 --> 12:23.166
There's an intruder
in the house.

12:25.036 --> 12:26.503
You think you can get him?

12:29.507 --> 12:32.542
Good boy! Then go
in there and get him!

12:41.587 --> 12:43.554
Bye-bye.

12:45.691 --> 12:49.226
Wwell, it's getting late.

12:49.261 --> 12:53.231
It l-looks like you've got
e-everything under control.

12:53.265 --> 12:56.601
So, I-I'll just go now.

12:56.635 --> 12:59.770
I'll g-get my driving gloves
some other time!

13:06.777 --> 13:08.378
What do we know?

13:08.412 --> 13:10.914
We know climbing inside
a mailbox is against the law.

13:10.948 --> 13:12.282
What else?

13:12.316 --> 13:14.117
The fire department's not happy

13:14.151 --> 13:16.552
when they have to use the jaws of
life to pry you out of a mailbox.

13:16.586 --> 13:18.087
What else?

13:18.121 --> 13:19.856
The city says you have to pay
to replace the mailbox

13:19.890 --> 13:22.758
or do 1,100 hours
of community service.

13:22.793 --> 13:24.727
What else?

13:24.762 --> 13:27.564
Tosh has been missing for 28 minutes
and we still haven't found him.

13:27.598 --> 13:28.899
Oh, right, the gopher.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.533
I totally forgot
about that whole situation.

13:30.568 --> 13:34.504
Well, I guess we're
back to square one.

13:34.538 --> 13:37.640
Or...

13:37.674 --> 13:40.943
Uhhuh, uh-huh, interesting...

13:40.978 --> 13:44.914
Maybe, could be... Ahh!

13:44.948 --> 13:46.983
I like where you're
going with this.

13:47.017 --> 13:48.918
I hadn't thought of that.

13:48.952 --> 13:51.621
You're good! What do you think?

13:51.655 --> 13:53.989
I think this is just the break
we've been looking for.

13:54.024 --> 13:55.992
Yeah, I think we'll be able
to focus a lot better

13:56.026 --> 13:57.827
after we make some cookies.

14:00.931 --> 14:02.565
I just set out
the poisonous gas,

14:02.600 --> 14:03.934
so that'll take care
of your spider.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.935
Just don't go back inside
for 24 hours.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.536
You don't want to
breathe that stuff in.

14:07.571 --> 14:09.638
Oh, and thanks
for the driving gloves!

14:09.673 --> 14:11.207
Don't mention it.

14:13.643 --> 14:14.977
Hi, Mr. bunny.

14:15.011 --> 14:16.979
Hey, gossamer,
what's the matter?

14:17.013 --> 14:19.014
My pet ran away.

14:19.049 --> 14:20.649
Aw, I'm sorry.

14:20.683 --> 14:21.916
His name's Webster.

14:21.951 --> 14:24.052
He looks like
an African sand spider,

14:24.086 --> 14:25.854
but he's actually harmless.

14:25.888 --> 14:30.859
I really miss him. Can you please
let me know if you see him?

14:59.688 --> 15:01.222
Gossamer!

15:02.491 --> 15:04.059
Look who I found.

15:04.093 --> 15:06.027
That's not Webster.

15:06.062 --> 15:07.963
There he is!

15:07.997 --> 15:11.667
Oh, I missed you
so much, buddy.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.007
I thought those cookies
would help us focus,

15:19.041 --> 15:22.043
but now I'm just really
full and tired

15:22.078 --> 15:23.645
and a little sick.

15:23.679 --> 15:25.980
Well, the gopher's been
gone an hour anyway.

15:26.015 --> 15:27.715
I think we should
just assume the worst

15:27.750 --> 15:29.684
and get on with our lives.

15:29.718 --> 15:31.652
But how are we gonna break
the news to that poor gopher?

15:31.686 --> 15:33.954
I don't know. E-mail? Text?

15:33.989 --> 15:36.190
The beauty of today's
electronic devices

15:36.224 --> 15:40.828
is that they allow you to maintain a cool
distance when delivering upsetting news.

15:40.862 --> 15:45.699
Ah! Or maybe we don't have to
break the news after all.

15:45.734 --> 15:47.268
Come on!

15:48.770 --> 15:51.072
Gotta keep that blood sugar up.

15:56.111 --> 15:59.147
Where are you, Tosh?

15:59.181 --> 16:01.083
Oh, wait. That's me.

16:01.117 --> 16:03.652
Where are you, Tosh?

16:03.687 --> 16:06.087
We found your friend!

16:06.122 --> 16:08.323
Where is he?

16:10.193 --> 16:11.826
Tada!

16:14.797 --> 16:19.100
I guess this case is closed.

16:21.136 --> 16:22.971
Oh, Tosh!

16:24.139 --> 16:25.540
Where were you?

16:25.574 --> 16:27.208
Why? Whatever do you mean?

16:27.242 --> 16:29.744
After I went to the mailbox,
I spent an hour in the park.

16:29.778 --> 16:32.113
I thought it would be good
to have a little time to myself,

16:32.147 --> 16:35.717
but the truth of the matter is,
I hated every second of it!

16:35.751 --> 16:37.785
Turns out, I didn't
want time to myself.

16:37.820 --> 16:40.087
I just want to be with you.

16:40.122 --> 16:41.288
Well, why didn't you tell me?

16:41.323 --> 16:42.756
You could have at least
left a note.

16:42.791 --> 16:44.224
But I did.

16:44.259 --> 16:46.994
I wrote it on that notepad
by the cash register.

16:51.131 --> 16:52.732
"Dear Mac,
I'm going to the park

16:52.766 --> 16:54.500
"to spend a little time alone.

16:54.534 --> 16:56.768
"I'm sure I'll hate it.
Didn't want you to worry.

16:56.803 --> 16:59.304
Xoxoxo, Tosh."

17:00.272 --> 17:04.142
You know what, I should
go help bugs...

17:04.176 --> 17:06.145
Kill that spider.

17:07.381 --> 17:09.382
Spiders can be pretty tricky.

17:10.684 --> 17:12.085
What, are you nuts?

17:12.118 --> 17:15.188
Why were you handling
a poisonous spider?

17:15.222 --> 17:18.157
You're lucky we didn't
have to amputate.

17:18.192 --> 17:19.859
Am I gonna be ok?

17:19.894 --> 17:24.196
You'll be fine.
Just go home. Get some rest.

17:24.231 --> 17:28.099
Oh. The exterminator said I
can't go home until tomorrow.

17:28.135 --> 17:32.805
Well, you don't have to go
home, but you can't stay here.

17:32.839 --> 17:34.740
Put this on twice a day.

17:34.774 --> 17:36.875
- What is it?
- Darvog.

17:36.909 --> 17:38.810
It's an anti-inflammatory.

17:38.845 --> 17:40.178
Better than amputating!

17:46.085 --> 17:48.186
How many hours
until we can go home?

17:48.220 --> 17:49.654
19.

17:51.423 --> 17:52.724
Who's your friend?

17:52.758 --> 17:54.559
I'm still deciding on a name.

17:54.593 --> 17:58.195
Right now, it's between lieutenant
maximilian Von Lundergartner

17:58.230 --> 17:59.864
or Frank.

17:59.898 --> 18:01.865
Well, you can't go wrong
with either one,

18:01.900 --> 18:04.168
except for that first one.

18:04.202 --> 18:07.238
I'm starving!
What is taking so long?

18:07.272 --> 18:09.240
Yeah, where's speedy?

18:09.275 --> 18:11.209
Oh, I missed you so much!

18:11.243 --> 18:12.911
I missed you so much!

18:12.945 --> 18:14.178
Well, I missed you more.

18:14.213 --> 18:16.882
Oh, don't be silly.
I missed you more.

18:22.188 --> 18:26.826
All right, gopher!
Gimme my $5.00!

18:26.860 --> 18:29.395

20:30.985 --> 20:32.753
No, it's just

20:32.787 --> 20:35.122
it's really too weird.
