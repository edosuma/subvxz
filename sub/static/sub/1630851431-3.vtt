WEBVTT

01:30.250 --> 01:31.458
-Hello.
-Hello.

01:31.541 --> 01:32.958
-For one?
-Yes.

01:37.541 --> 01:38.750
Hello.

01:40.000 --> 01:40.958
Welcome.

01:41.041 --> 01:42.625
-Make yourself at home.
-Hello.

01:42.708 --> 01:44.166
PAIK JONG-WON

01:45.125 --> 01:47.083
Would you like your water cold?

01:47.166 --> 01:49.375
-Or hot?
-I'd like some hot water.

01:49.458 --> 01:50.833
Sure, a glass of hot water.

01:51.583 --> 01:53.000
It's a bit chilly today.

01:53.583 --> 01:54.666
Be right back.

02:08.250 --> 02:09.958
I didn't want to burn your tongue.

02:10.041 --> 02:12.125
-I mixed some cold water.
-Thank you.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.291
-Is there a menu?
-Wet tissue first.

02:14.375 --> 02:15.333
I'll bring it out.

02:23.833 --> 02:24.791
Here you go.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.750
You've got
a lot of Korean traditional liquor.

02:29.833 --> 02:30.875
Yes.

02:35.875 --> 02:37.500
I wanted a back bar

02:37.583 --> 02:40.791
with many Korean liquor
naturally mixed in.

02:40.875 --> 02:42.875
That's unique for a bar. I like it.

02:43.708 --> 02:47.541
They blend nicely with foreign liquor.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.166
-Right.
-It doesn't look out of place.

02:50.250 --> 02:52.458
-I had to look carefully to tell.
-Right.

02:54.083 --> 02:55.833
Cocktails are named after Korean regions.

02:58.458 --> 03:01.250
I make cocktails using Korean liquor.

03:01.333 --> 03:03.708
-This menu is a bit…
-They're all…

03:03.791 --> 03:07.458
This way, the customers
can easily relate to the menu.

03:07.541 --> 03:09.458
"Andong." Many regional names on the menu.

03:09.541 --> 03:10.625
-"Yeoju," too.
-Yes.

03:10.708 --> 03:12.458
They're named after Korean regions.

03:12.541 --> 03:14.708
I use their local ingredients and alcohol.

03:14.791 --> 03:16.208
Then walnuts for "Cheonan"?

03:16.708 --> 03:17.625
-Yes.
-So it is.

03:17.708 --> 03:18.541
CHEONAN

03:18.666 --> 03:21.541
Cheonan's known for hodu-gwaja
and grape spirits called Dureang.

03:21.625 --> 03:23.333
"Andong." Many regional names.

03:23.416 --> 03:24.708
-"Yeoju," too.
-Yes.

03:24.791 --> 03:27.291
-Peanuts from Yeoju.
-Yes, Yeoju peanuts.

03:27.375 --> 03:30.125
"Yeoju No. 2" has other ingredients.
Yeoju has fertile land.

03:30.208 --> 03:33.000
They're known for earth produce
such as sweet potatoes.

03:33.083 --> 03:35.333
-Kooksoondang is like this.
-I see "Hamyang," too.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.666
-Yes, Damsol of Hamyang.
-This is fun.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.500
And some other local ingredients.

03:40.708 --> 03:42.208
It's an interesting menu.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.666
-"Jeju."
-Yes.

03:46.750 --> 03:48.041
"Jeju" sounds nice.

03:48.125 --> 03:49.666
Shall we start with "Jeju"?

03:49.750 --> 03:51.458
I'm torn between "Yeoju" and "Jeju."

03:51.541 --> 03:53.708
"Should I drink 'Yeoju' or 'Jeju'?" Funny.

03:53.791 --> 03:57.958
-I've got ties to Jeju so I'll try "Jeju."
-Sure, "Jeju" as your first choice.

03:59.458 --> 04:02.166
I was just in the process
of making "Jeju."

04:02.250 --> 04:05.458
-I can explain it as I make it.
-For another table? Great, I'll watch it.

04:05.541 --> 04:06.375
Yes.

04:06.458 --> 04:08.000
The ingredients…

04:08.083 --> 04:09.875
If you think of Jeju,

04:09.958 --> 04:11.916
there's a famous local liquor.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.875
-Omegisul.
-Right, Omegisul.

04:13.958 --> 04:16.958
We use Gosorisul as the base,
which is distilled from Omegisul.

04:17.041 --> 04:18.041
Gosorisul!

04:18.791 --> 04:20.916
People don't know what that is.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.875
I used to think
it was some sort of animal.

04:23.958 --> 04:25.875
-A raccoon or a badger.
-Right.

04:25.958 --> 04:29.166
It turns out
that's a dialect for sojugori.

04:29.250 --> 04:30.250
Correct.

04:39.541 --> 04:44.041
GOSORI, SOJUGORI, GOSORI

04:44.125 --> 04:48.625
So in that region,
they call spirits made this way "gosori."

04:48.708 --> 04:51.083
I was wondering what it was at first, too.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.458
Actually, I didn't know
what omegi was either.

04:54.125 --> 04:56.250
-It's millet.
-Right.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.958
It's actually glutinous millet
but it's called omegi.

04:59.041 --> 05:01.833
I didn't know what omegi-tteok was.
It's really millet-tteok.

05:09.291 --> 05:16.000
OMEGI, MILLET, OMEGI

05:35.750 --> 05:38.500
COOKING RICE

05:50.708 --> 05:54.375
COOLING RICE

06:39.333 --> 06:41.166
FERMENTING

06:48.666 --> 06:50.958
FILTERING THEN BOTTLING

07:13.041 --> 07:16.250
YAKJU

07:20.958 --> 07:23.541
OMEGISUL

07:44.666 --> 07:46.333
COLD WATER

07:50.208 --> 07:53.833
WHAT IF YOU DISTILL OMEGISUL?

08:13.458 --> 08:16.250
GOSORISUL

08:25.458 --> 08:26.458
Exactly.

08:27.083 --> 08:29.833
-Yes.
-Millet spirit.

08:29.916 --> 08:31.250
Distilled in sojugori.

08:31.333 --> 08:32.750
You know your alcohol well.

08:32.833 --> 08:33.791
-Me?
-Yeah.

08:33.875 --> 08:36.250
I do know a thing or two about food.

08:36.875 --> 08:39.416
-I actually like drinking.
-I see.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.291
The color is unique for Gosorisul.

08:41.375 --> 08:42.583
Why this color?

08:42.666 --> 08:44.083
This one.

08:44.166 --> 08:47.375
We put in some Solomon's seal
and Jeju mandarin zest.

08:47.458 --> 08:49.750
-In Gosorisul?
-Yes.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.000
-Here?
-Yes.

08:51.083 --> 08:52.250
That makes sense.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.333
To get this color, you'd need caramel

08:55.416 --> 08:57.291
or put it in oak barrel for a while.

08:57.375 --> 08:58.250
You're right.

08:58.333 --> 09:02.541
If you smell it, you'll notice
Solomon's seal gives it a chocolaty scent.

09:02.625 --> 09:03.625
-You're right!
-Yes.

09:03.708 --> 09:05.041
It's because it's roasted.

09:05.125 --> 09:07.291
-But there's no chocolate?
-Not at all.

09:07.375 --> 09:08.791
-It's the Solomon's seal?
-Yup.

09:08.875 --> 09:10.250
-Wait, once more.
-Sure.

09:11.541 --> 09:13.541
Do you want to taste some?

09:13.625 --> 09:15.416
No, I'll have the cocktail first.

09:15.500 --> 09:16.500
Got it.

09:23.041 --> 09:24.375
Very interesting.

09:25.208 --> 09:28.500
I found out that Solomon's seal
can bring out such flavor when…

09:28.583 --> 09:30.250
Being Korean, I always thought

09:30.333 --> 09:32.583
that Solomon's seal had a hearty flavor.

09:32.666 --> 09:34.750
Like from the tea I drank as a child.

09:34.833 --> 09:35.875
That was it.

09:35.958 --> 09:37.750
Then I talked to foreign bartenders

09:37.833 --> 09:41.000
and they complimented Solomon's seal
as an excellent spice.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.291
I was very surprised by the smell.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.000
It was an interesting discovery.

09:46.125 --> 09:47.500
Fascinating.

09:48.083 --> 09:49.708
Absolutely fascinating.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.625
This doesn't bring out
enough of the citrus flavor

09:53.708 --> 09:57.375
so we mix Hondiju or Nimome
which have mandarin in it.

09:57.458 --> 09:59.416
-Some fermented alcohol.
-Hondiju!

09:59.500 --> 10:01.333
HONDIJU

10:01.458 --> 10:02.958
It'd smell like mandarin then.

10:03.041 --> 10:05.583
So it's a cocktail with a citrus base,

10:06.125 --> 10:09.333
the creaminess of Jeju mandarin chocolate

10:10.083 --> 10:12.333
and some lemon and sweeteners.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.958
That's unexpected.
Mixing Gosorisul and Hondiju…

10:17.041 --> 10:18.083
And here

10:18.958 --> 10:20.333
we add egg whites.

10:21.666 --> 10:23.708
-Egg? Egg whites?
-Yes.

10:23.791 --> 10:26.250
This is a classic technique.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.250
From mid to late 1800s, I think?

10:29.041 --> 10:33.000
Back then, people enjoyed drinks
with lemon juice in it

10:33.083 --> 10:35.791
calling it "sours" for the sour flavor.

10:35.875 --> 10:42.041
If you add egg whites to it,
you get a rich flavor and fluffy texture.

11:44.041 --> 11:47.000
Here's your "Jeju." Enjoy.

12:03.166 --> 12:05.250
One "Jeju" for you.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.750
This way, here?

12:12.708 --> 12:14.000
-Now…
-Is that mine?

12:14.083 --> 12:15.666
Yes, here's your "Jeju."

12:16.208 --> 12:17.583
-Thank you.
-Sure.

12:18.708 --> 12:19.666
-Like this?
-Thanks.

12:19.750 --> 12:21.166
Yes, any way you'd like.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.458
The egg white will give it
a fluffy texture

12:24.541 --> 12:28.500
and the lemon oil spritzed on top
will bring out a fresh scent.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.125
Wow.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.666
If I hadn't seen it,
I wouldn't know it's egg whites.

12:35.750 --> 12:38.166
-It doesn't taste like egg at all.
-Right.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.041
I thought there'd be a chocolaty flavor.

12:52.125 --> 12:53.833
-But it's just the scent.
-Correct.

12:53.916 --> 12:57.500
It's a hint of chocolate
added to sour and smooth type of cocktail.

12:57.583 --> 13:00.083
-I taste heartiness.
-Yes.

13:00.166 --> 13:03.791
Hondiju gives it a scent of mandarin.

13:07.250 --> 13:08.500
I'm glad you like it.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.375
It's delicious.

13:16.833 --> 13:17.833
It's brilliant.

13:20.416 --> 13:21.750
I appreciate it.

13:21.833 --> 13:23.541
No, really. You're amazing.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.583
How did you come up with this?

13:38.666 --> 13:41.708
-I thought bartenders…
-Yes.

13:41.791 --> 13:44.875
…took great pride in filling their shelves
with foreign liquor

13:44.958 --> 13:47.416
but this is nearly a quarter

13:48.250 --> 13:50.916
devoted to Korean traditional liquor.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.458
Yes, you're right.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.625
I felt similarly until a few years ago.

13:55.708 --> 13:57.583
Then about five, six years ago

13:57.666 --> 14:01.541
-I went to a bartending contest.
-I hear you have many of those.

14:01.625 --> 14:03.708
And as I traveled the world,

14:03.791 --> 14:07.416
I would see a tiny country
with one local liquor

14:07.500 --> 14:11.916
being so proud of it,
and making cocktails with it.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.208
It was really inspiring.

14:13.291 --> 14:18.166
I studied whiskey and gin everyday
but knew nothing about Korean liquor.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.041
-Right.
-So once that hit me,

14:20.125 --> 14:22.208
I got back and went to gayangju lab.

14:22.291 --> 14:25.083
I don't mean to be rude
but what an admirable young man.

14:25.166 --> 14:26.708
-It's an honor.
-I mean it.

14:26.791 --> 14:29.958
I'm just getting into
Korean traditional liquor.

14:30.041 --> 14:34.208
I look for specific brands and try them.
And because I cook,

14:34.291 --> 14:38.666
I wish Korean traditional liquor
would become more widely-known.

14:38.750 --> 14:41.375
Just then, I see places like this
gathered here.

14:41.458 --> 14:42.958
I feel very grateful.

14:43.041 --> 14:46.583
It's great to be able to pick
from our own selection of alcohol.

14:47.208 --> 14:49.875
Korean traditional liquor bars
are popular now, right?

14:49.958 --> 14:50.958
Definitely.

17:50.708 --> 17:52.041
This is mine.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.958
I'm starving.

19:15.791 --> 19:17.333
Welcome!

19:17.416 --> 19:18.500
Welcome.

19:18.583 --> 19:19.875
Hyeongnim, how are you?

19:21.708 --> 19:22.916
Long time no see.

19:23.000 --> 19:23.875
How are you?

19:23.958 --> 19:25.125
-It's been a while.
-Hi.

19:25.208 --> 19:26.541
LEE JOON-GI

19:26.625 --> 19:28.208
What a great vibe.

19:29.833 --> 19:32.083
I didn't see you coming.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.166
-How've you been?
-How are you?

19:35.250 --> 19:37.083
-Hyeongnim.
-You've lost more weight.

19:37.166 --> 19:38.916
Work. Shooting wears you out.

19:39.583 --> 19:40.583
Yeah.

19:41.291 --> 19:43.208
You look younger!

19:44.291 --> 19:45.666
You look cuter.

19:46.833 --> 19:47.833
Cute…

19:48.666 --> 19:50.500
-That's the impression you're giving me.
-Well.

19:50.583 --> 19:52.333
-Having kids might've done it.
-Yeah?

19:53.875 --> 19:56.916
-We can't meet to volunteer these days.
-I know.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.583
Which do you prefer?

19:58.666 --> 20:01.083
I used to call you hyeongnim.

20:01.166 --> 20:02.458
-Or…
-Hyeongnim it is.

20:02.541 --> 20:05.291
That's what we decided last time we drank.

20:05.375 --> 20:06.208
Right.

20:07.250 --> 20:08.625
-Can we order…
-Hello.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.541
YOUNGER FRIEND

20:09.625 --> 20:12.291
Do you like anything in particular?

20:12.375 --> 20:14.958
I will go with your recommendation.

20:15.041 --> 20:16.791
Then let's start with tenderloin.

20:16.875 --> 20:18.375
-Yup.
-200g of tenderloin.

20:19.125 --> 20:21.375
And then

20:21.458 --> 20:24.375
-Rib-eye cap.
-That's actually part of prime rib-eye.

20:24.458 --> 20:26.125
Prime rib-eye includes the cap.

20:26.208 --> 20:28.541
-Then 200g of rib-eye cap alone.
-Yup.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.041
-How's outside skirt?
-Good.

20:30.125 --> 20:31.583
200g of outside skirt.

20:32.208 --> 20:34.333
Tenderloin, outside skirt, rib-eye cap.

20:34.416 --> 20:36.500
-We're eating all of that?
-It's not much.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.416
Anything else you recommend?

20:39.500 --> 20:41.416
I would recommend

20:41.500 --> 20:43.333
-123A ribs.
-123A ribs.

20:43.416 --> 20:46.666
-Yes.
-We'll take a little thicker cut of that.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.500
We can do that.

20:49.083 --> 20:50.583
Let's see. For drinks…

20:51.166 --> 20:54.875
-Great selection of Korean liquor.
-Yes, many Korean traditional liquor.

20:54.958 --> 20:57.625
We've got a variety
for you to pair with food.

20:58.458 --> 21:01.250
I should tell you now.
Do you have a corkage fee?

21:01.333 --> 21:02.375
-I brought my own.
-Yes.

21:02.458 --> 21:04.083
It's 10,000 won per bottle.

21:04.166 --> 21:06.125
Regardless of the type of alcohol.

21:06.208 --> 21:08.750
-Wine or Korean alcohol?
-Yes, all the same.

21:08.833 --> 21:10.958
-10,000 won? Not bad.
-Yes, 10,000 won.

21:11.041 --> 21:13.166
I brought two, so I'll let you know later.

21:13.250 --> 21:14.416
-What?
-Sure.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.291
-You can handle that.
-I should've guessed.

21:17.375 --> 21:19.333
I should've brought gloves.

21:19.416 --> 21:21.875
-I'll be crawling out of here.
-We'll try a few today.

21:21.958 --> 21:23.375
Two bottles is nothing.

21:23.458 --> 21:25.416
It's you! We can do it.

21:26.125 --> 21:27.208
Let's see.

21:28.958 --> 21:30.250
They carry this?

21:30.333 --> 21:31.625
-You have Bokdanji?
-We do.

21:31.708 --> 21:34.083
This is hard to find. We'll take one.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.333
BOKDANJI

22:32.000 --> 22:39.000
BOKDANJI

22:45.500 --> 22:46.708
Excuse me.

22:46.791 --> 22:48.458
I'll set up the drinks first.

22:48.541 --> 22:50.041
I'm glad. We need it now.

22:50.625 --> 22:51.875
First, aperitif.

22:53.750 --> 22:55.083
To begin.

22:55.166 --> 22:58.000
Compare this
to the bokbunja liquor you used to drink.

22:58.916 --> 23:00.375
Do you know what bokbunja is?

23:00.875 --> 23:04.208
Sure, but…

23:04.833 --> 23:06.291
-It's…
-I've only had it as liquor.

23:06.375 --> 23:07.375
Right.

23:15.583 --> 23:18.958
Technically speaking,
it's called Joseon strawberry.

23:19.041 --> 23:21.541
Before there were regular strawberries,
we'd think of this

23:21.625 --> 23:22.708
as strawberry and eat it.

23:24.833 --> 23:27.791
JOSEON STRAWBERRY?

23:28.791 --> 23:30.666
BOKBUNJA!

23:53.791 --> 23:56.291
BOKDANJI
KANG JIN-HEE

24:26.666 --> 24:28.291
-It's been a while.
-Yes.

24:28.916 --> 24:30.083
Let's go for it.

24:32.458 --> 24:33.458
Wait…

24:35.500 --> 24:38.125
Compare this
to the bokbunja liquor we usually drink.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
I am so ready to drink.

24:50.166 --> 24:52.083
The scent is richer.

24:52.166 --> 24:53.375
-Right? Rich scent.
-Yes.

24:53.458 --> 24:55.791
This is different
from typical bokbunja liquor.

24:55.875 --> 24:57.583
The ones we usually drink.

24:57.666 --> 25:00.458
Bokbunja is not normally sweet.

25:00.541 --> 25:01.791
Not this sweet, anyway.

25:01.875 --> 25:06.000
There's some sweetness
but it's not this sweet.

25:06.583 --> 25:10.708
When you make fruit wine, you put in sugar

25:10.791 --> 25:13.208
-and then pour alcohol over it.
-Yes.

25:13.291 --> 25:15.791
That's how bokbunja liquor
is typically made.

25:16.666 --> 25:21.083
What's special about this
is that it's made differently.

25:21.958 --> 25:23.416
There are basic ingredients.

25:23.500 --> 25:26.666
Rice, nuruk, water.

25:27.166 --> 25:29.458
-Nuruk ferments the rice.
-Right.

25:29.541 --> 25:32.958
So you mix the three
to get to fermentation.

25:33.041 --> 25:34.916
Depending on how you make the alcohol

25:35.000 --> 25:38.166
with the right ratio of water and rice,

25:38.833 --> 25:39.708
it becomes sweet.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.833
They added bokbunja to that sweetness.

25:42.916 --> 25:45.208
So this is naturally sweet.

25:45.791 --> 25:47.375
-A little different.
-Naturally.

25:47.875 --> 25:49.041
Simple ingredients.

25:49.125 --> 25:50.208
-Sweeteners?
-None.

25:50.291 --> 25:51.250
Just nuruk, rice…

25:51.333 --> 25:53.000
Nuruk, rice, purified water.

25:53.916 --> 25:57.083
So it's not as sweet
as other bokbunja liquors.

25:57.625 --> 25:59.083
-Yeah?
-It's a natural sweetness.

26:00.708 --> 26:02.541
How do you study all that?

26:02.625 --> 26:05.791
I don't. I try it myself.
I distill alcohol at home.

26:06.666 --> 26:08.333
My wife got so mad.

26:08.416 --> 26:09.875
You buy all the equipment?

26:10.666 --> 26:12.083
Well, I get curious.

26:13.416 --> 26:16.291
When do you have the time?

26:16.375 --> 26:18.958
She won't let me play games
so I'm left with this.

26:19.958 --> 26:22.041
I like games but that's off limits.

26:22.625 --> 26:23.875
It's fun.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.041
-Is that ours?
-Yup.

26:26.125 --> 26:28.583
Let me show you your meat
minus the outside skirt.

26:28.666 --> 26:31.500
I will work on that
while you eat this first.

26:31.583 --> 26:34.416
This is the tenderloin.
I brought the center cut for you.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.916
These are the rib-eye cap
and the 123A ribs.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.083
123A ribs have the most marbling in hanu.

26:39.166 --> 26:40.250
You can eat in this order.

26:40.333 --> 26:41.708
RIB-EYE CAP, TENDERLOIN, 123A RIBS

26:41.791 --> 26:42.875
-I'll prepare it now.
-Yes.

26:42.958 --> 26:44.833
-We'll grill it for you.
-Thank you.

26:46.708 --> 26:47.750
It's marvelous.

26:47.833 --> 26:48.916
Welcome!

27:13.541 --> 27:16.166
HANU

31:32.875 --> 31:34.000
This is tenderloin?

31:34.083 --> 31:35.291
-Tenderloin.
-Tenderloin.

31:44.625 --> 31:45.833
It just melts.

31:48.916 --> 31:50.250
How's the meat?

31:50.333 --> 31:51.500
-Great.
-Delicious.

31:54.333 --> 31:55.250
It's so good.

31:57.541 --> 31:59.333
-Tasty.
-So juicy.

32:18.041 --> 32:19.166
Great texture.

32:20.125 --> 32:22.333
Can we get new glasses for my bottle now?

32:22.416 --> 32:24.791
-I'll change the glasses.
-So you can bring your own.

32:24.875 --> 32:26.416
Now, let's try my bottles.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.750
-I'll clear this for you.
-Yes.

32:32.916 --> 32:35.125
-Dugyeonju?
-Guess what it is.

32:36.750 --> 32:37.750
Dugyeon…

32:38.416 --> 32:39.458
Gyeon for dogs?

32:42.375 --> 32:44.250
Drink it and we become two dogs?

32:45.000 --> 32:47.750
You're still witty, all right.

32:47.833 --> 32:50.916
You haven't changed.
Alcohol still brings out the wits in you.

32:52.250 --> 32:54.916
I remember last time,
you were not fun at all

32:55.000 --> 32:56.375
until you got drunk.

32:57.041 --> 32:58.583
Here are your glasses.

32:59.291 --> 33:02.083
The name says it all.

33:03.625 --> 33:05.500
Dugyeonju.

33:05.583 --> 33:08.000
-Here's a hint. Dugyeonsae.
-Dugyeonsae.

33:08.750 --> 33:10.291
Dugyeonsae, little cuckoo.

33:17.708 --> 33:19.166
Little cuckoo? No idea.

33:19.250 --> 33:20.708
-Really?
-I don't know.

33:20.791 --> 33:23.375
It's in the song,
"Maiden of Soyanggang River."

33:24.708 --> 33:25.916
-It's in the song?
-Yup.

33:26.500 --> 33:27.500
Little cuckoo?

33:28.666 --> 33:31.208
The little cuckoo cried so sadly

33:31.291 --> 33:33.625
that it spat up blood and died.
And in that spot…

33:33.708 --> 33:35.666
-a flower sprouted.
-A flower.

33:37.750 --> 33:39.250
Korean rosebay on the side!

33:39.333 --> 33:41.041
You weren't supposed to see that!

33:42.916 --> 33:44.000
-So…
-Korean rose bay.

33:44.083 --> 33:46.000
-Korean rosebay.
-In the liquor.

33:46.583 --> 33:50.416
Alcohol made with Korean rosebay
is called Dugyeonju.

33:52.250 --> 33:54.875
The origins go back a thousand years.

33:54.958 --> 33:56.375
Thousand-year history.

33:56.458 --> 33:59.000
During Goryeo Dynasty,
there was a famous general.

33:59.083 --> 34:01.041
-General Bok Ji-gyeom.
-Right.

34:01.125 --> 34:04.375
The tale has it
that he retired to the countryside.

34:04.458 --> 34:07.208
But he fell ill
when he got to his hometown, Myeoncheon.

34:07.750 --> 34:10.333
As he was slowly dying away,

34:10.416 --> 34:12.083
his dutiful daughter, Yeong-Ryang

34:12.166 --> 34:15.250
prayed for a hundred days.
It's a theory, of course.

34:15.333 --> 34:17.791
Then a spirit appeared…

34:17.875 --> 34:19.708
-Spirits are essential to these tales.
-Yes.

34:19.791 --> 34:23.666
The spirit told her to make a liquor
using glutinous rice and Korean rosebay.

34:23.750 --> 34:25.333
-He gave her a recipe.
-Yes.

35:56.583 --> 35:58.625
DUGYEONJU

36:11.708 --> 36:14.375
MYEONCHEON DUGYEONJU
PRESERVATION SOCIETY

36:43.625 --> 36:47.291
The spirit also told her to use
the water from a spring called Ansaem.

36:48.166 --> 36:52.416
And then to brew it for 100 days
before the father drinks it.

36:52.500 --> 36:55.083
So he recovered.

36:55.166 --> 36:56.166
But…

36:57.250 --> 36:59.166
-I see.
-What does that mean?

36:59.250 --> 37:00.208
It means this.

37:00.291 --> 37:03.666
There is a spring called Ansaem
in Myeoncheon, present day Dangjin.

37:04.541 --> 37:08.125
I'd never heard of it.

37:08.750 --> 37:10.333
There are many more.

37:10.416 --> 37:11.666
For example,

37:11.750 --> 37:13.916
when we think of
traditional Korean liquor,

37:14.000 --> 37:15.250
we think of Andong soju.

37:15.333 --> 37:16.666
-That's it.
-That's famous.

37:16.750 --> 37:19.583
But there are so many more.
Hansan Sogokju, to start.

37:19.666 --> 37:24.291
The culture of Korean traditional liquor
stems from homemade gayangju.

37:24.375 --> 37:26.500
We have a culture
of making liquor at home.

37:27.666 --> 37:30.500
It's more fun to drink
when you know the story behind it.

37:30.583 --> 37:31.583
Yeah.

37:35.041 --> 37:37.416
-I've never seen this.
-Cheers. Oh, wait.

37:38.250 --> 37:40.875
In remembrance
of the thousand-year-old tale.

37:42.083 --> 37:44.666
Liquor with a thousand-year-old tale.

37:54.208 --> 37:56.333
This is not for chugging.

37:56.416 --> 37:58.750
-Right.
-It tastes so good.

37:59.416 --> 38:01.416
With this…

38:01.500 --> 38:04.458
-I feel the buzz rise pleasantly.
-Yes.

38:04.541 --> 38:06.916
I think our alcohol culture
needs to change a bit.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.958
We should enjoy the drink
instead of going for the quantity.

38:10.041 --> 38:11.875
Drink it slowly and enjoy it.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.541
We never learned it that way, that's why.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.958
-I learned it that way, too.
-From our seniors.

38:17.041 --> 38:18.833
-Me too.
-"No break mid-drink."

38:18.916 --> 38:20.916
That's what you get used to.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.291
And I've never encountered
these good-quality liquors.

38:24.375 --> 38:26.250
-When I first learned to drink…
-Well.

38:26.333 --> 38:29.083
During the Japanese annexation,

38:29.166 --> 38:31.458
homemade liquors were banned
for liquor tax.

38:31.541 --> 38:32.916
We lost our culture then.

38:33.916 --> 38:39.291
We lost many recipes for quality liquor.

38:40.041 --> 38:41.666
This liquor, too.

38:41.750 --> 38:44.833
They used to make it in Dangjin
until the ban was introduced.

38:44.916 --> 38:47.875
But during the 1988 Olympics
and the 1986 Asian Games,

38:47.958 --> 38:50.791
the government proposed
restoration of our traditional liquor.

38:50.875 --> 38:52.083
That's when we found this.

38:52.166 --> 38:56.541
And there's a story behind it.
To restore it, they found a successor.

38:56.625 --> 38:58.416
-Right.
-They started restoring it,

38:58.500 --> 39:00.250
but the successor passed away.

39:00.333 --> 39:01.541
So they lost it, again.

39:02.333 --> 39:05.916
Then in the 2000s,
they tried to restore it again.

39:06.000 --> 39:10.083
So, they gathered people
who knew the recipe well in that town

39:10.916 --> 39:13.750
and told them to make the liquor
for a tasting.

39:14.375 --> 39:15.750
-A blind testing.
-I see.

39:15.833 --> 39:17.250
It wasn't an individual effort.

39:17.333 --> 39:20.083
Everyone shared
their recipes to restore the liquor.

39:27.916 --> 39:29.125
KIM HYEON-GIL, CHAE WU-SUN

39:33.208 --> 39:34.458
KIM YU-SUN

39:36.625 --> 39:38.500
LEE SANG-YEOL

39:41.333 --> 39:43.791
LEE SEONG-SUK, PARK NO-GYU, KIM SANG-DON

39:47.291 --> 39:49.208
YU JAE-SEOK

40:36.458 --> 40:41.041
SHOW ME THE DUGYEONJU

40:44.958 --> 40:46.208
This was no easy feat.

40:46.291 --> 40:47.458
-Researching.
-Right.

40:47.541 --> 40:49.416
Failure after failure.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.958
They worked very hard
to get to the final product.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.333
-A thousand-year-old recipe.
-Yes.

40:55.125 --> 40:57.083
-It's amazing they found it.
-Right?

40:57.166 --> 41:00.625
-And to remember and continue it.
-Yes.

41:00.708 --> 41:02.500
We don't look hard enough.

41:02.583 --> 41:05.125
But there are many places in the country

41:05.208 --> 41:07.125
that are restoring the local liquor.

41:07.208 --> 41:09.916
They find and restore
traditional liquor recipes, even now.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.750
And it's increasing astronomically.

41:11.833 --> 41:12.791
It's great.

41:12.875 --> 41:15.750
It really makes a difference
to know what you're drinking.

41:15.833 --> 41:17.125
-Definitely.
-Yes.

41:17.208 --> 41:19.500
The depth and the scent are different.

41:22.666 --> 41:25.416
Even for Korean traditional liquor,
I start by sniffing.

41:26.333 --> 41:27.583
That's the amazing thing.

41:27.666 --> 41:29.625
You are an excellent student.

41:31.500 --> 41:34.541
Excuse me. Here's your rib-eye cap.

41:35.458 --> 41:36.833
-What's this?
-Rib-eye cap.

41:36.916 --> 41:39.125
-It looks like a shrimp.
-This.

41:39.208 --> 41:41.666
-Gotta eat the leaner meat first.
-Yes.

41:44.875 --> 41:46.333
It pairs well.

41:46.416 --> 41:48.166
It goes well with this, too.

41:51.458 --> 41:52.958
Rib-eye cap's full of flavor.

41:53.750 --> 41:55.333
With the liquor…

41:55.416 --> 41:57.541
-It works, right?
-Enjoying with the liquor

41:57.625 --> 41:59.916
brings out the flavor even more.

42:15.541 --> 42:18.375
-You're definitely a drinker.
-No, I'm already…

42:18.958 --> 42:20.458
-This vibe…
-Nice buzz, right?

42:20.541 --> 42:21.833
I feel…

42:23.375 --> 42:24.375
very…

42:25.083 --> 42:28.416
I feel like
I'm already getting high on this vibe.

42:28.500 --> 42:30.000
Drink first, then the meat.

42:30.083 --> 42:31.666
-Rib-eye cap.
-Yes.

42:33.166 --> 42:36.000
It'll be different from the tenderloin.

42:36.083 --> 42:38.166
You'll taste the rich flavor.

42:39.708 --> 42:42.333
I should've brought a memo pad.

42:42.416 --> 42:44.458
-Why?
-I'm learning so much.

42:45.166 --> 42:47.708
I forget things after drinking these days.

42:48.541 --> 42:52.416
Before, I used to remember everything
that the seniors would tell me

42:52.500 --> 42:53.875
when we drank together.

42:54.666 --> 42:56.375
If you remembered all that…

42:56.458 --> 42:58.500
You're not so young anymore.

42:59.750 --> 43:01.583
But it's such a waste of information

43:02.583 --> 43:03.583
to not keep record.

43:03.666 --> 43:05.833
I could write it down for my fans

43:05.916 --> 43:07.500
so I can explain to them later.

43:07.583 --> 43:10.708
Your love for your fans amaze me.

43:11.458 --> 43:13.791
-I'm so grateful for them.
-Yes, it's amazing.

43:13.875 --> 43:16.083
Do you not feel that way these days?

43:17.625 --> 43:19.375
I didn't think that in my lifetime

43:19.458 --> 43:24.208
I'd see Korean culture reaching the world,
getting praised and recognized globally.

43:24.291 --> 43:26.375
The Academy Awards, for example.

43:26.458 --> 43:28.208
-Two years in a row.
-Yes.

43:28.291 --> 43:30.375
Parasite, Ms. Youn Yuh-jung.

43:30.458 --> 43:35.541
I grew up watching Hollywood films,
so that world feels surreal to me.

43:35.625 --> 43:38.208
-lt's like landing on the moon.
-But…

43:38.291 --> 43:43.416
It's thanks to people like you.

43:43.500 --> 43:46.458
-There were many before me.
-You're humble.

43:46.541 --> 43:48.541
-You, for example.
-I did nothing!

43:49.333 --> 43:50.583
-K-food.
-Nah.

43:50.666 --> 43:53.125
Korean food came this far

43:53.208 --> 43:56.291
because actors and artists

43:56.375 --> 44:00.333
spread our culture
through their influence.

44:00.416 --> 44:02.708
Showing our food culture
in movies and dramas.

44:02.791 --> 44:04.458
That's what's making us shine.

44:07.500 --> 44:08.625
Right.

44:08.708 --> 44:12.791
Lately, more than ever, I'm thankful.

44:12.875 --> 44:16.333
It's not easy
to accept a different culture

44:17.125 --> 44:20.541
and like it for what it is.

44:20.625 --> 44:22.750
So, for me,

44:22.833 --> 44:25.791
I appreciate
being able to contribute to that.

44:25.875 --> 44:27.791
For Korean culture

44:27.875 --> 44:30.000
to be accepted
and appreciated more widely.

44:30.083 --> 44:31.500
That's what's great about you.

44:32.750 --> 44:34.666
You can take credit, but you don't.

44:35.250 --> 44:37.250
I used to.

44:37.333 --> 44:38.416
-Really?
-Yes.

44:38.500 --> 44:39.958
I've never seen it.

44:40.041 --> 44:43.208
The buzz word here last year
was "OK boomer."

44:44.083 --> 44:46.375
-Right.
-I used to be one.

44:46.458 --> 44:49.500
I'd tell the junior actors,
"You have to get through this."

44:49.583 --> 44:51.541
"Try harder and be more creative."

44:51.625 --> 44:54.458
"Get here early."

44:54.541 --> 44:56.125
And the bottom line would be,

44:56.208 --> 44:58.416
"You have it easy compared to us."

44:58.500 --> 44:59.500
Right.

44:59.583 --> 45:01.416
"The shooting environment is comfy."

45:01.500 --> 45:03.375
"Yet, you aren't trying harder

45:03.458 --> 45:06.458
and staring at your phone instead?"

45:06.541 --> 45:08.708
"Instead of arriving early to practice?"

45:08.791 --> 45:10.500
I would want to say these things.

45:11.291 --> 45:14.708
Except I would only think it inside.

45:15.750 --> 45:18.500
At one point,
I realized how pathetic I was.

45:18.583 --> 45:20.083
It wasn't like I could tell them.

45:21.583 --> 45:23.166
I just kept it to myself.

45:23.833 --> 45:25.458
I felt like a coward.

45:26.375 --> 45:30.125
And that my thoughts
were becoming obsolete.

45:30.791 --> 45:32.958
-You're doing well.
-I need to be objective.

45:33.041 --> 45:34.958
I'm working on it.

45:35.041 --> 45:39.166
On how to overcome that mindset
in a cool manner.

45:39.250 --> 45:40.458
So I wanted to ask you

45:40.541 --> 45:45.333
if and how you overcame that
and how to be wiser.

45:45.416 --> 45:47.291
I told you before,

45:47.375 --> 45:50.625
I try to follow the younger generation.

45:50.708 --> 45:52.583
-That's how I got into Korean liquor.
-Yeah?

45:52.666 --> 45:55.125
That's what I'm grateful for.

45:55.208 --> 45:57.291
-It works the other way around.
-Right.

45:57.375 --> 46:00.291
For the younger generation,
Korean traditional liquor is trendy.

46:00.375 --> 46:02.250
They drink what suits them best.

46:02.333 --> 46:03.916
And I think they are right.

46:04.666 --> 46:06.583
"K-pop? That works."

46:06.666 --> 46:08.375
"K-food must work too, then."

46:08.458 --> 46:10.958
"Young people like this these days?"

46:11.041 --> 46:12.875
That's how I came to try it.

46:12.958 --> 46:15.916
I brewed makgeolli at home and it was fun.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.375
I'd look up literature
and find out I was right.

46:19.500 --> 46:21.666
"Our way was the right way."
I'd think that.

46:21.750 --> 46:24.250
When it comes to learning,

46:24.833 --> 46:26.916
there's no age discrimination.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.291
-You learn from the young.
-Yes.

46:30.041 --> 46:33.375
So you find common grounds
from such communication.

46:33.458 --> 46:37.375
I think a lot about mannerism.

46:37.458 --> 46:39.166
Mannerism is habitual.

46:39.250 --> 46:41.833
It's toxic because I'm unaware of it.

46:42.750 --> 46:45.833
It' not about me being right

46:45.916 --> 46:48.125
or my ideas being right,

46:49.375 --> 46:51.541
and saying empty words like,
"I understand."

46:52.666 --> 46:54.916
You're saying
you constantly seek better ideas.

46:55.000 --> 46:55.916
-Yes.
-Even now.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.500
"This is the recent trend?" Like that.

46:58.583 --> 47:01.083
And it doesn't matter
whom you're learning it from.

47:01.875 --> 47:03.333
It's about learning the flow.

47:03.833 --> 47:08.041
What matters more than knowing
is finding out what you don't know.

47:10.916 --> 47:12.625
-Here.
-I feel the same way.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.083
This is…

47:16.166 --> 47:19.666
On my way here,

47:19.750 --> 47:22.541
I knew I'd get drunk quickly with you.

47:24.750 --> 47:27.083
I'm gonna talk about
all sorts of things later.

47:56.250 --> 48:00.000
Excuse me. I've grilled your 123A ribs.

48:00.833 --> 48:02.375
-It's ready to eat.
-123A ribs?

48:02.458 --> 48:03.583
-Yes.
-Thank you.

48:04.708 --> 48:06.500
Different liquor for the fatty cut.

48:06.583 --> 48:07.791
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

48:07.875 --> 48:09.333
This liquor is harder.

48:11.708 --> 48:13.833
This is spirit,
so smaller glasses will do.

48:13.916 --> 48:14.791
Sure.

48:15.375 --> 48:18.125
-It looks like beautiful hanbok.
-Let me clear this out.

48:18.208 --> 48:19.875
-This.
-Yes.

48:19.958 --> 48:21.541
Liquor with a story.

48:21.625 --> 48:22.958
And this?

48:25.708 --> 48:28.541
It looks like hanbok. Like the skirt.

48:29.958 --> 48:32.083
First of all,

48:32.166 --> 48:33.500
look at the color.

48:38.666 --> 48:40.666
There's a hint of red, right?

48:45.041 --> 48:47.041
Now, smell it.

48:48.416 --> 48:49.833
It's a mysterious smell.

48:52.541 --> 48:55.083
What's this smell? What is this?

48:57.916 --> 49:00.500
I brought special spirits for you.

49:01.666 --> 49:05.375
It's got all sorts of scent.

49:05.458 --> 49:07.416
You look like a profiler right now.

49:07.500 --> 49:10.291
What's the use of staring?
That won't tell you anything.

49:12.125 --> 49:13.833
Now, taste it.

49:13.916 --> 49:15.291
A little bit…

49:18.166 --> 49:19.166
Whoa!

49:21.791 --> 49:22.625
Whoa!

49:23.500 --> 49:26.000
I forgot to tell you this is a spirit.

49:27.541 --> 49:28.541
Strong, isn't it?

49:29.541 --> 49:30.916
-This is a spirit.
-This…

49:31.000 --> 49:33.583
-This is easily 40% ABV.
-Yes, this is quite high.

49:33.666 --> 49:34.666
Spirits.

49:36.500 --> 49:39.166
I forgot to tell you.

49:40.083 --> 49:41.375
-Spirits.
-Yes.

49:42.583 --> 49:44.291
What do you taste?

49:49.625 --> 49:50.625
Strong, isn't it?

49:54.750 --> 49:57.916
How do I describe this smell?

49:58.833 --> 50:01.208
-This…
-I need more hints.

50:01.291 --> 50:03.208
-Byeoljubujeon.
-Byeoljubujeon.

50:03.291 --> 50:06.833
In that tale, the turtle tells the rabbit

50:06.916 --> 50:09.333
that there's this liquor
at the sea palace.

50:10.666 --> 50:12.458
-You probably don't know.
-Plum flower?

50:13.041 --> 50:14.375
This is called Gamhongro.

50:51.833 --> 50:53.333
GAMHONGRO
LEE GI-SUK

50:53.416 --> 50:55.833
In the tale,
the turtle promises Gamhongro.

50:55.916 --> 50:58.000
That there's Gamhongro at the sea palace.

50:58.083 --> 50:59.666
-"So let's go, rabbit?"
-Yes.

51:00.208 --> 51:01.333
So the rabbit follows.

51:01.416 --> 51:03.625
That's an alcoholic rabbit for sure.

51:04.833 --> 51:06.125
-Gamhongro.
-This.

51:06.208 --> 51:08.375
So as I told you earlier,

51:08.458 --> 51:11.500
this is distilled liquor.

51:11.583 --> 51:12.958
After distilling it,

51:13.541 --> 51:16.541
you mix other ingredients in for infusion.

51:16.625 --> 51:17.458
-Infusion.
-Yes.

51:17.541 --> 51:20.083
The scents are from the infusion.

51:20.166 --> 51:23.541
Trying to guess
each ingredient is quite fun.

51:24.958 --> 51:27.458
-You won't get it at first.
-I'm clueless.

51:27.541 --> 51:29.416
I don't even know where to begin.

51:31.375 --> 51:33.958
No need to get discouraged.
It took me 30 tries.

51:35.666 --> 51:37.083
Anything less would be a feat.

51:37.791 --> 51:41.375
You're just trying to make me feel better.

51:41.458 --> 51:43.166
Seriously, how do you guess this?

51:44.791 --> 51:46.166
To guess it…

51:47.083 --> 51:49.083
I feel the scent…

51:58.791 --> 52:00.375
Color is pink.

52:02.875 --> 52:04.291
The scent spreads instantly.

52:05.750 --> 52:07.916
The finishing taste…

52:09.583 --> 52:10.875
lingers a while.

52:10.958 --> 52:13.958
-Mysterious scent.
-After drinking this,

52:14.041 --> 52:16.791
what I got right first was cinnamon.

52:16.875 --> 52:18.666
-Yes, this is cinnamon.
-Yes.

52:19.750 --> 52:22.041
-I knew something was pungent.
-Yeah.

52:22.125 --> 52:24.000
-That's it.
-It's not easy.

52:24.083 --> 52:26.083
It's got oriental medicinal ingredients.

52:26.166 --> 52:30.375
Gamhongro appears in Byeoljubujeon

52:30.458 --> 52:34.083
and is considered valuable
because of the ingredients.

52:34.166 --> 52:37.500
There's one that you would never guess.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.791
-That I would never guess?
-Really.

52:44.875 --> 52:46.291
Yongan, or longan.

52:46.958 --> 52:48.500
-Yong, like dragon?
-Dragon's eye.

52:48.583 --> 52:50.208
-It's known as longan.
-Longan.

52:52.208 --> 52:54.083
LONGAN

55:57.291 --> 55:58.500
Nice.

55:59.791 --> 56:02.583
That's why it's considered so valuable.

56:02.666 --> 56:06.541
That's crazy.
So it's got various medicinal ingredients.

56:06.625 --> 56:08.375
They were used for medicine, right?

56:08.458 --> 56:11.291
-Right.
-Right?

56:11.375 --> 56:13.833
So they used valuable ingredients

56:13.916 --> 56:17.458
to infuse in this liquor,
which makes the liquor valuable.

56:17.541 --> 56:20.875
And they also used rice,
which we consider valuable

56:20.958 --> 56:24.333
to carefully ferment it.

56:24.416 --> 56:27.791
Then they distilled it again.
This was a common method at homes.

56:28.291 --> 56:32.458
Listening to you,

56:32.541 --> 56:34.083
I'm a bit embarrassed.

56:34.666 --> 56:36.500
When you drink whiskey, for example,

56:36.583 --> 56:40.625
you study whether it's single malt,

56:40.708 --> 56:42.375
or how to best drink it,

56:42.458 --> 56:44.833
or the effort that goes into making it,

56:44.916 --> 56:47.541
or the distillation method.

56:48.125 --> 56:51.875
But when it comes to liquor
from my own motherland

56:51.958 --> 56:54.583
and the traditional liquor from that land,

56:54.666 --> 56:57.875
I don't know how it's made
or how to best drink it.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.166
I had no idea the kind of effort
that goes into making these.

57:03.250 --> 57:04.500
-But…
-I'm clueless.

57:04.583 --> 57:07.750
Don't be ashamed.
We didn't have access to the information.

57:08.416 --> 57:11.041
People making these
have been around for a long time.

57:11.125 --> 57:13.375
They struggled over generations.

57:14.125 --> 57:17.583
Those making these traditional liquors

57:17.666 --> 57:21.250
went through a lot
trying to continue the history.

57:21.333 --> 57:23.416
Some would call them crazy drunkards.

57:23.500 --> 57:26.500
Some had to start from scratch
to find the right information.

57:27.833 --> 57:32.333
But when you talk to these people,
you find out that they enjoy the process.

57:33.166 --> 57:34.583
-Right.
-As if…

57:35.750 --> 57:37.583
All of them. When you meet them.

57:37.666 --> 57:40.375
"Of course, this is my duty."
They would say.

57:44.750 --> 57:47.958
"FATHER'S LAST GIFT
WITH THIS I DREAM OF MY FATHER"

57:48.041 --> 57:49.500
LEE GI-SUK

57:52.791 --> 57:55.750
MADE FOR OTHERS, IT'S THEIR LIQUOR
POURED FOR ME, IT'S MY BUD!

57:55.833 --> 57:57.125
YU JAE-SEOK

57:57.208 --> 58:00.041
BLOOD, SWEAT, TEARS… AND HOPE

58:00.125 --> 58:01.958
GANG JIN-HUI

58:02.041 --> 58:03.708
At times like this…

58:03.791 --> 58:05.750
Yes, hard liquor matches this.

58:11.416 --> 58:13.541
If you ask me,

58:14.625 --> 58:18.166
I can feel the moment coming

58:18.250 --> 58:20.250
when I won't want the night to end.

58:21.416 --> 58:23.666
We could go on talking all night.

58:24.791 --> 58:26.791
I want to keep talking about liquor.

58:27.416 --> 58:29.750
-Does your wife like it too?
-She does now.

58:29.833 --> 58:31.458
Because I make so much of it.

58:32.416 --> 58:33.541
Drinking together…

58:33.625 --> 58:36.083
It's not easy for a couple
to drink together

58:36.708 --> 58:40.291
or have similar interests.

58:40.375 --> 58:42.500
-It's a great advantage.
-It's good.

58:42.583 --> 58:44.958
Now that I'm married,

58:45.041 --> 58:47.625
I find it meaningful
to share a hobby with my wife.

58:49.541 --> 58:51.750
-Really.
-It really is great.

58:52.791 --> 58:54.250
When I go drink these days,

58:54.875 --> 58:58.625
because of my age,
the conversation revolves

58:59.125 --> 59:01.291
around my work half the time

59:01.375 --> 59:05.333
and concerns about me the other half.

59:05.416 --> 59:08.625
As you just said,

59:09.208 --> 59:11.208
I wonder how long I can stay single.

59:12.916 --> 59:16.833
The right time doesn't just come.
Even for you.

59:17.916 --> 59:20.083
Your wife didn't suddenly appear.

59:20.875 --> 59:23.208
-She did.
-Out of nowhere?

59:24.041 --> 59:26.208
-My wife…
-When did you meet her?

59:26.916 --> 59:28.875
-When I was 48?
-Really?

59:28.958 --> 59:32.208
That time came later for me, too.
I'd given up on getting married.

59:32.291 --> 59:34.041
I still have seven years.

59:34.125 --> 59:36.041
You can't think that way.

59:36.916 --> 59:38.291
You're funny.

59:39.416 --> 59:41.875
I thought I wasn't meant to get married.

59:41.958 --> 59:44.166
-I'd given up.
-Were you a workaholic?

59:44.250 --> 59:46.666
-I was.
-When it comes to work…

59:47.333 --> 59:49.083
As if I was meant to work all my life.

59:49.166 --> 59:51.291
You're worse.

59:51.375 --> 59:54.208
-You love your work and do a lot of it.
-I…

59:54.291 --> 59:56.666
I'm a perfectionist.

59:56.750 --> 59:59.833
But I think that's just the phase I'm in.

59:59.916 --> 1:00:01.916
If not for work,

1:00:03.458 --> 1:00:07.083
I don't know what else I'd have in life.

1:00:07.166 --> 1:00:08.500
Work is my passion.

1:00:08.583 --> 1:00:12.958
It gives my life some meaning.

1:00:13.041 --> 1:00:16.958
I don't believe much in totemism
but some things are meant to be.

1:00:17.041 --> 1:00:20.291
-I do the sign of the cross.
-And told myself I should work hard.

1:00:20.375 --> 1:00:22.083
What else is there in life anyway?

1:00:22.166 --> 1:00:24.750
Really, I had given up.

1:00:24.833 --> 1:00:26.541
And then she suddenly appeared.

1:00:26.625 --> 1:00:27.750
Wow.

1:00:28.625 --> 1:00:29.916
I should learn from you.

1:00:33.916 --> 1:00:35.041
Respect to you.

1:00:37.041 --> 1:00:38.208
I mean…

1:00:40.625 --> 1:00:42.666
That's the hard part for me.

1:00:48.333 --> 1:00:49.541
It's not too late.

1:00:50.250 --> 1:00:52.250
You're just getting started at 40.

1:00:52.333 --> 1:00:54.916
That's when you start
thinking about marriage.

1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:58.458
I wish my parents were here.

1:00:58.541 --> 1:01:00.166
You should've brought them.

1:01:01.875 --> 1:01:02.875
Man…

1:01:02.958 --> 1:01:05.833
-More meat?
-We're ready for the meal.

1:01:05.916 --> 1:01:06.750
Meal?

1:01:06.833 --> 1:01:09.083
-Doenjang-jjigae?
-You got it.

1:01:09.166 --> 1:01:10.583
-Pa-bab, too.
-Pa-bab, it is.

1:01:10.666 --> 1:01:12.000
-Do they go along?
-Yup.

1:01:12.083 --> 1:01:14.375
Then to wrap up, we need a new bottle.

1:01:14.458 --> 1:01:16.333
This. Seoul Night.

1:01:16.416 --> 1:01:17.666
-Do you have this?
-Yes.

1:01:17.750 --> 1:01:19.208
I'll get that ready for you.

1:02:02.541 --> 1:02:05.375
PA-BAB

1:02:12.125 --> 1:02:13.958
DOENJANG-JJIGAE

1:02:24.833 --> 1:02:26.208
-Here's your pa-bab.
-Thanks.

1:02:26.291 --> 1:02:28.291
We split it into two bowls for you.

1:02:28.375 --> 1:02:30.083
-Nice. Thanks.
-Thank you.

1:02:30.875 --> 1:02:31.875
Thank you.

1:02:33.250 --> 1:02:35.750
-You can put the meat on top of the rice.
-Thanks.

1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:38.291
This is for you.

1:02:38.375 --> 1:02:40.875
-Take the big piece.
-Thank you.

1:02:42.083 --> 1:02:43.416
Koreans are weird.

1:02:43.500 --> 1:02:46.083
We have to finish with rice.

1:02:46.625 --> 1:02:49.208
I actually quit carbs.

1:02:49.291 --> 1:02:50.125
You did?

1:02:50.208 --> 1:02:52.333
But I'm craving it today.

1:02:52.416 --> 1:02:56.250
It's been five years since I quit flour.

1:02:57.541 --> 1:03:01.375
As for white rice,
it's been about two to three years.

1:03:01.458 --> 1:03:02.666
-Really?
-Yes.

1:03:05.333 --> 1:03:07.375
I could eat about ten bowls of this.

1:03:09.041 --> 1:03:12.000
Today, you make it look extra delicious.

1:03:15.083 --> 1:03:16.833
Good drink boosts my appetite.

1:03:16.916 --> 1:03:18.125
So good, it's insane.

1:03:18.208 --> 1:03:21.041
Koreans enjoy the meal more
when the atmosphere is right.

1:03:24.791 --> 1:03:25.958
Unbelievable.

1:03:30.875 --> 1:03:32.875
This is incredible because…

1:03:36.458 --> 1:03:38.708
I haven't had white rice in so long.
It's so good.

1:03:39.250 --> 1:03:41.750
Why'd you quit rice?

1:03:43.666 --> 1:03:45.750
I really missed this.

1:03:47.750 --> 1:03:49.625
This is touching. I'm…

1:03:50.458 --> 1:03:52.208
-You're making my heart ache.
-Wow.

1:03:53.666 --> 1:03:55.375
This is it. This is a meal.

1:03:57.166 --> 1:03:58.375
Wow.

1:03:58.458 --> 1:03:59.875
They cooked it just right, too.

1:04:00.416 --> 1:04:01.541
Just firm enough.

1:04:13.166 --> 1:04:14.291
I can't.

1:04:21.541 --> 1:04:23.166
Today, wow.

1:04:26.041 --> 1:04:28.291
This is spirit made with plums.

1:04:29.708 --> 1:04:30.750
Here.

1:04:31.416 --> 1:04:32.833
It's an honor.

1:04:39.625 --> 1:04:40.875
Wow.

1:04:42.583 --> 1:04:43.750
I'll be here all night.

1:04:44.958 --> 1:04:45.958
Seoul night.

1:04:46.958 --> 1:04:47.958
Something tells me

1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:50.500
it will be a long, good night.

1:05:20.958 --> 1:05:24.708
SEOUL NIGHT
HAN JEONG-HUI

1:07:07.875 --> 1:07:08.708
Right?

1:07:09.416 --> 1:07:10.416
One more shot.

1:07:13.041 --> 1:07:14.708
Wow, today.

1:07:18.791 --> 1:07:19.791
This is bad.

1:07:22.083 --> 1:07:23.708
It's getting late.

1:07:23.791 --> 1:07:28.375
It's getting late
but this is so clear and crisp.

1:07:28.458 --> 1:07:29.458
The flavor.

1:07:29.958 --> 1:07:31.291
It's a beautiful night.

1:07:56.208 --> 1:07:58.083
I should buy some for a new hobby.

1:07:58.166 --> 1:07:59.875
Try it at home. It's really fun.

1:08:00.458 --> 1:08:02.375
-You know how my wife is.
-Sure do.

1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:05.458
-She's not the jealous type.
-Right.

1:08:05.541 --> 1:08:07.291
But she gets jealous of the liquor.

1:08:07.375 --> 1:08:09.958
Because ever since
I started making liquor,

1:08:10.041 --> 1:08:12.500
the first thing I do in the morning

1:08:12.583 --> 1:08:14.166
is looking into the liquor jar.

1:08:14.250 --> 1:08:17.083
I listen to see if it's doing all right.

1:08:17.166 --> 1:08:19.833
One day, my wife started yelling.

1:08:19.916 --> 1:08:21.416
She asked me what I was doing.

1:08:21.500 --> 1:08:23.583
But then she stopped being mad

1:08:23.666 --> 1:08:25.791
when I poured her the alcohol.

1:08:25.875 --> 1:08:27.458
-It's yummy, you see.
-I see.

1:08:27.541 --> 1:08:28.958
She goes, "This is good."

1:08:29.791 --> 1:08:30.958
Try it at home.

1:08:31.041 --> 1:08:33.291
You might meet your other half
making liquor.

1:08:34.416 --> 1:08:37.625
-Right.
-Share a hobby with her.

1:08:38.166 --> 1:08:40.625
-Hobbies…
-I need to date first

1:08:40.708 --> 1:08:42.416
-to give it to a wife.
-True.

1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.875
Should I start a liquor making club?

1:08:46.708 --> 1:08:48.500
-Make it together there?
-Yes.
