Okay. Actually, open your

No, my eyes are open. I'm

Ah! Right?
- What is that?

36:23.345 --> 36:26.378
Where'd you get it from?
It's basically like a...

36:26.414 --> 36:28.615
a warrior face paint.

36:28.650 --> 36:30.282
Warrior.
- I think it's like a trophy

36:30.318 --> 36:32.118
for killing it in my challenges.

36:32.153 --> 36:34.353
(chuckles) You know.
It's warrior face paint?

36:35.423 --> 36:37.223
I know, dude. I want some.

my lips stick together a little bit.

36:40.194 --> 36:42.661

36:42.696 --> 36:44.363

36:56.210 --> 36:59.044
Where are we? What are
we doing here, Mike?

36:59.079 --> 37:00.979
Dude, dude, dude, just
take your green pellet.

37:01.015 --> 37:03.314
Okay? There you go.
- (gulps, sighs)

37:03.350 --> 37:06.217

Those types of questions...

37:06.253 --> 37:08.820
It's... it's a fool's
errand to try to answer.

37:08.856 --> 37:10.122
Okay? This is our life.

37:10.157 --> 37:12.958
This is how it's always been and
this is how it always will be.

37:12.993 --> 37:16.528
You know, I bet you the cave rats
asked these very same questions

37:16.563 --> 37:19.164

jerking off to stars or whatever.

37:19.199 --> 37:20.465
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

37:20.500 --> 37:23.000
Well, here, take another pill,
and let's... No. You know what?

37:23.036 --> 37:25.770
I'm actually good. Me and
Lumpy are going to dinner later

37:25.805 --> 37:27.338

37:27.374 --> 37:29.774

37:29.809 --> 37:32.209
That's cool. Oh, that's cool.
You guys are going to dinner?

37:32.244 --> 37:33.924
Yeah. - And that's just
a you-and-her thing?

37:33.946 --> 37:35.995
Yeah, we're not double-dating
or anything this week. Okay.

37:36.015 --> 37:37.830
Yeah, yeah. Right, right.
It's just gonna be like...

37:37.850 --> 37:39.116
(sniffles)
- What did you say?

37:39.152 --> 37:42.286
I didn't. I breathed in through
my nose sharply. (clears throat)

37:42.321 --> 37:45.022
If you're inviting me, I, of course, will go.
- No.

37:45.058 --> 37:47.391

nights for me and Lumpy.

37:47.426 --> 37:49.775

just get out and really enjoy...

37:49.795 --> 37:51.377
You guys are together
almost every night.

37:51.397 --> 37:53.479
I don't know how many times I
have to go over this with you.

37:53.499 --> 37:56.333
(slowly) Friday nights?
Can you understand me now?

37:56.368 --> 37:58.016
That's offensive.
- (coughs) If I just speak...

37:58.036 --> 37:59.618
That's an offensive accent.
What accent was I doing?

37:59.638 --> 38:02.739
I can't even tell, but there's a hint
of something... It was just... (coughs)

38:02.774 --> 38:03.855
...and I don't like it. No. No, no, no.

38:03.875 --> 38:06.076
Can I please come?
- (emphatically) I'm not going

38:06.111 --> 38:09.278
over this again! Lumpy: Boys, boys.

38:09.314 --> 38:13.583
Boys. Now, Philly, I
think it would be so nice

38:13.618 --> 38:18.088
to have Mike at dinner. You
know, we've got plenty of pellets.

38:18.123 --> 38:20.856
(chuckles) Lumpy, you keep
me sane. Do you know that?

38:20.891 --> 38:23.125
You're the only thing worth living for

38:23.160 --> 38:24.960
in this crazy, mixed-up world.

38:24.995 --> 38:27.496
Mike, of course you can come.
I'm sorry. Oh, such a good man.

38:27.532 --> 38:29.332
Isn't he such a good man? A great guy.

38:29.367 --> 38:30.733
Great guy. Two great people.

that, too. Just mild arousal.

goes to Madison Square Garden.

40:14.869 --> 40:16.936
Earl "The Pearl" Monroe shooting guard,

40:16.971 --> 40:18.637
Walt "Clyde" Frazier at the two.

40:18.672 --> 40:19.871
That's just my starting team.

me should play for the Knicks.

40:25.212 --> 40:26.345
We would be good.

40:26.380 --> 40:28.079
I mean, we'd be fantastic. Quick.

40:28.114 --> 40:29.748
We'd be sick. We have four arms.

40:29.783 --> 40:31.350
Four arms.
- Check it out.

40:31.385 --> 40:34.753
Okay, yeah, we would have some problems
with the size. Yeah, you are a little short.

(stammers) I had a little

Gnats are smaller than us! That's true.

fleas. Wait a second.

41:15.160 --> 41:18.362
Damn, dude. Sometimes
it's... it's all too much.

41:18.397 --> 41:20.330
What do you mean, Erik?
I was just thinking...

41:20.366 --> 41:22.732
There's this monkey,
we're in his asshole...

41:22.768 --> 41:26.836
Does he even know we exist?
Probably not. You know?

41:26.872 --> 41:29.038
But then, does God even know we exist?

41:29.073 --> 41:31.140
And-and... and if he
did know we existed,

41:31.175 --> 41:32.475
why would he even care about us?

41:32.511 --> 41:34.611
Corey: I don't know.
Maybe he doesn't, man.

41:34.646 --> 41:38.047
Maybe we're free. Just passing through.

41:38.082 --> 41:41.050
A brief pause in the great cosmic dance.

41:41.085 --> 41:43.752
It's like we're between
planes of existence, you know?

41:43.788 --> 41:45.888
We're ephemeral.
- You know what I like about you?

41:45.924 --> 41:48.357
You got good words, Corey. Thanks, Erik.

41:48.393 --> 41:51.593
We are ephemeral. It's like
I'm only a small reflection

41:51.629 --> 41:54.363
of the world I
constructed. Yeah, exactly.

41:54.399 --> 41:58.467
I... I am big. I mean, I am the
second-tallest flea on this monkey's ass.

41:58.502 --> 42:00.168

42:00.203 --> 42:01.269

42:06.009 --> 42:07.391

42:07.411 --> 42:10.679

monkey blood, too! How you like that?

42:10.714 --> 42:13.148

know? I don't know. I'm gay.

42:38.575 --> 42:41.442

Well, don't apologize.
Maybe... maybe you try again.

- Yes.

there's a cat in here or something."

I think there's more than that! I...
I had a fucking vision last night

51:09.202 --> 51:11.301
that we lived in the sewers, dude.

51:11.337 --> 51:13.070
I had a mom, and you had parents,

51:13.105 --> 51:15.573
and we'd listen to 311,
dude, and it was sick tight.

51:15.608 --> 51:18.141
Phil, you're seriously acting crazy.

51:18.177 --> 51:20.644
You need to eat. Just take
a pellet. I don't... (gags)

51:20.680 --> 51:23.781
(slurring) Eat the pellet, dude. Eat the...
- Whoa!

51:23.816 --> 51:26.549
(normal voice) pellet. Come on.
That's it, dude. It's the pellets!

51:26.585 --> 51:29.052
They're clouding our fucking
vision, man. That's why Lumpy...

51:29.088 --> 51:31.188
What are you guys talking about?
- Jesus Christ.

51:31.223 --> 51:32.737
Okay, stand back from
me, Lumpy. Hey, Lumpy.

51:32.757 --> 51:34.657
Hi.
- All right, dude? I don't want any trouble.

51:34.693 --> 51:36.693
Mike, listen to me. The pellets?

51:36.728 --> 51:38.828
It's like a brain wash or something like that.
- What?

51:38.864 --> 51:41.198
And Lumpy wants us to eat
them because she only exists

51:41.233 --> 51:43.533
because we take the pills, Mike.
- That's nonsense.

51:43.568 --> 51:46.369
That's ridiculous. Why would
you listen to him? Umm...

51:46.404 --> 51:47.804
He's crazy and half-starved.

51:47.839 --> 51:49.405
Okay, well, that's a good point.

51:49.440 --> 51:52.457
That's what happens when you don't eat
the pellets! I fucking look good, Mike.

51:52.477 --> 51:53.492
You get sad. You look terrible.

51:53.512 --> 51:54.726
I'm not sad! I'm the
happiest I've ever been!

51:54.746 --> 51:57.580
Because I'm thinking straight,
baby! If he's not gonna eat,

51:57.616 --> 51:59.448
we're gonna make him, okay, Mikey?

51:59.484 --> 52:01.217
Oh shit.
- Are you with me, or are you not?

52:01.252 --> 52:03.752
Mikey! This is a little nuts,
Mike, don't you agree, dude?

52:03.787 --> 52:05.336
Like maybe something
bigger is at work here?

52:05.356 --> 52:06.504
It's for his own good. Give me the pill.

52:06.524 --> 52:08.473
I'm warning you, dude.
You're gonna eat this shit.

52:08.493 --> 52:10.341
She's freaking me out. You'd
better have an umbrella,

52:10.361 --> 52:12.443

rain up in this motherfucker.

what counts, you know?

That's interesting. For me,
she only held me like a baby,

59:38.528 --> 59:40.829
sang to me, and brushed my
hair. That sorta stuff. Mm-hmm.

59:40.864 --> 59:42.964
Ah. Interesting. So,
hmm, that's interesting.

59:42.999 --> 59:45.433
Mom: Okay, maybe that's
enough questions for now.

59:45.469 --> 59:48.536
We're all very tired. (cheering)

59:48.572 --> 59:49.786
Can you two shake each other's hands

59:49.806 --> 59:51.922
so I can take a black and
white photo with a flashbulb?

59:51.942 --> 59:53.356
I don't see why not? Phil: Yeah, sure.

59:53.376 --> 59:55.892
If you can imagine, it'll be right
on the cover of the newspaper.

59:55.912 --> 59:57.126
Uh-uh, don't smile. (flash poofs)

59:57.146 --> 59:59.113
Reporter: Pssh! And here it spins.

01:00:00.016 --> 01:00:01.148
(rat coughs)

01:00:01.184 --> 01:00:02.683
Reporter: Any second now.

01:00:03.986 --> 01:00:05.651
Hmm. I don't know... Oh, there it is.

01:00:07.422 --> 01:00:09.456
Ah. Feels good to be home, huh?

01:00:09.491 --> 01:00:11.824
It feels good, man. It
feels good to be on the air.

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:14.394
Well, in New York City
air. Safe and sound.

01:00:14.429 --> 01:00:15.795

01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:18.531

01:00:19.868 --> 01:00:22.468

01:00:22.504 --> 01:00:26.171
