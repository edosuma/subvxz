00:02.001 --> 00:04.061
pu'cha!
Prepare to meet your ancestors.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:24.657 --> 00:27.387
This battle is yours today,

00:27.460 --> 00:30.793
but the House of Mo'Kai
will never yield.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.529
DoH- cha Scree!

00:36.603 --> 00:37.570
Move away, coward.

00:37.637 --> 00:39.798
l want to make this kill.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.467
You should have killed me
when my back was turned.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.305
l want to see
the fear in your eyes.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.309
Look closely

00:45.378 --> 00:47.141
and you'll see
your own destruction.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.477
You are resilient prey.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.642
l'm no one's prey!

00:58.691 --> 00:59.988
You are mine

01:00.060 --> 01:02.995
now and after death.

01:03.997 --> 01:07.057
Sick Bay, this is Holodeck 2.

01:07.133 --> 01:11.001
Janeway requires
medical assistance.

03:05.985 --> 03:07.282
She'll survive.

03:07.353 --> 03:09.480
What about her neural interface?

03:12.625 --> 03:14.559
Stable.

03:14.627 --> 03:16.390
Are you sure?

03:16.462 --> 03:17.656
There were times

03:17.730 --> 03:21.063
when she seemed...
aware of who she is.

03:21.134 --> 03:22.362
lmpossible.

03:22.435 --> 03:24.903
l was monitoring the crew
during the entire simulation.

03:24.971 --> 03:28.168
She believes she's whoever
we program her to be.

03:28.241 --> 03:30.903
Shall l return her
to the Klingon simulation?

03:30.977 --> 03:34.378
No. Bring her to Holodeck 1.

03:34.447 --> 03:38.144
l've found another program
l want to try.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.778
A conflict that took place
on her own planet.

03:40.853 --> 03:43.185
lt should prove...

03:43.256 --> 03:45.019
stimulating.

04:00.039 --> 04:04.408
Wrong

04:04.477 --> 04:09.915
Would it be wrong to kiss

04:09.983 --> 04:15.683
Seeing l feel like this?

04:15.755 --> 04:24.823
Would it be wrong to try?

04:24.897 --> 04:29.231
Wrong

04:29.302 --> 04:34.501
Would it be wrong to stay

04:34.574 --> 04:40.410
Here in your arms this way

04:40.480 --> 04:46.282
Under this starry sky?

04:46.352 --> 04:53.884
lf it is wrong...

04:53.960 --> 04:56.121
Welcome to Le Coeur de Lion.

04:56.195 --> 04:57.890
l'm Katrine.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.864
The first round
is with my compliments

04:59.932 --> 05:00.796
on one condition--

05:00.900 --> 05:04.063
you leave the war outside.

05:04.103 --> 05:07.231
More escargot
for table nine, hmm?

05:07.307 --> 05:10.834
Jacques, no lady tonight?

05:10.910 --> 05:13.879
Oh- ho. We'll have to see
what we can do about that.

05:13.946 --> 05:15.743
Forgive my neglecting you.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.043
Now, where were we?

05:17.116 --> 05:20.108
Ah, yes, my latest
adventure in Paris.

05:20.186 --> 05:23.587
..Wrong

05:23.656 --> 05:28.423
When l need you so much...

05:28.494 --> 05:31.292
l'm afraid l have
to neglect you again.

05:31.364 --> 05:32.353
Excuse me.

05:33.399 --> 05:37.358
...so long

05:37.437 --> 05:43.637
lt must be right...

05:43.710 --> 05:45.473
That's him.

05:45.545 --> 05:47.240
Our new commandant?

05:47.313 --> 05:48.905
British lntelligence believes
he's been sent here

05:48.981 --> 05:50.972
to oversee the occupation
of the city.

05:51.050 --> 05:51.982
What's his history?

05:52.085 --> 05:53.109
He served with Rommel

05:53.186 --> 05:55.484
in North Africa
and Schmidt in Poland.

05:55.555 --> 05:57.989
He is a formidable
military strategist,

05:58.057 --> 06:00.025
notorious for his cruelty.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.687
Well, let's make him
feel at home.

06:02.762 --> 06:04.252
Send him a bottle
of Chateau Latour.

06:04.330 --> 06:05.524
My compliments.

06:05.598 --> 06:06.826
The'29?

06:06.899 --> 06:07.957
Oh, l hate to waste good wine.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.592
Give him the'36.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.637
As you wish.

06:11.704 --> 06:19.406
...And l have waited so long

06:19.479 --> 06:27.648
lt must be right

06:27.720 --> 06:37.356
lt can't be wrong.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.429
Merci.

06:44.504 --> 06:46.233
Be generous to Claude
this evening.

06:46.305 --> 06:49.274
Without him, my voice is empty.

06:49.342 --> 06:50.604
Good evening.

06:53.012 --> 06:54.240
Sing.

06:54.313 --> 06:55.974
Tonight's performance
is over.

06:56.048 --> 06:56.980
Return tomorrow.

06:57.049 --> 06:58.482
Now.

06:58.551 --> 07:00.644
Remove your hand.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.847
Obey me

07:02.922 --> 07:05.288
or l will hunt you down

07:05.358 --> 07:08.054
and your bones will adorn
the bulkhead of my ship.

07:08.127 --> 07:10.254
Sit down and play the game.

07:10.329 --> 07:13.059
ln this setting,
we have no ships.

07:13.132 --> 07:15.123
We are an ancient race
of soldiers

07:15.201 --> 07:17.669
intent
upon conquering this world.

07:17.737 --> 07:19.136
Play the game.

07:19.205 --> 07:22.003
Now, now. What's this?

07:22.074 --> 07:23.006
Mademoiselle de Neuf

07:23.075 --> 07:24.702
will be happy
to sing another song.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.074
Just give her a few minutes
to freshen up.

07:26.145 --> 07:27.237
lt's late.

07:27.313 --> 07:28.610
Freshen up.

07:31.617 --> 07:32.879
Very well.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.886
Commandant Karr.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.478
You know me.

07:36.556 --> 07:38.319
Your reputation precedes you.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.086
l'm Katrine.

07:40.159 --> 07:41.922
Le Coeur de Lion
is my establishment.

07:42.028 --> 07:44.462
The first round
is with my compliments

07:44.530 --> 07:47.431
on one condition--
you leave the war outside.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.060
l wish to speak with her...

07:50.136 --> 07:51.626
alone.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.149
Charming gentleman.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.551
He is disoriented.

08:08.621 --> 08:11.249
Your world is unfamiliar to him.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.848
He'll be comfortable
soon enough.

08:12.925 --> 08:15.155
The arms of France
are open to all.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.196
l've heard otherwise.

08:17.263 --> 08:18.321
What do you mean?

08:18.397 --> 08:20.194
l understand
there is opposition

08:20.266 --> 08:22.996
to our presence here
among your citizens.

08:23.069 --> 08:24.696
The Resistance?

08:24.770 --> 08:27.034
ln Paris, perhaps,

08:27.106 --> 08:30.269
but this is a small city,
defenseless.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.835
We've learned to be
a little more diplomatic.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.437
When this war is over,

08:35.515 --> 08:38.279
we want to remain
on good terms with the victor.

08:38.351 --> 08:42.378
- Whoever that may be.
- Whoever that may be.

08:44.056 --> 08:47.514
Your city may be defenseless,
but it's crucial to the war.

08:47.593 --> 08:49.925
Any ground assault into Germany

08:50.029 --> 08:52.327
must pass through
this province.

08:52.398 --> 08:55.060
The Resistance will come here.

08:55.134 --> 08:58.160
lf they do, l'll tell them
what l tell everyone...

08:59.839 --> 09:01.568
leave the war outside.

09:04.110 --> 09:06.044
Excellent.

09:06.112 --> 09:07.704
Commandant, l've been informed

09:07.780 --> 09:10.214
there's a problem
in the Engineering section.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.945
The warp plasma network
has become unstable.

09:13.019 --> 09:14.714
What's he talking about?

09:14.787 --> 09:16.880
lt need not concern you.

09:19.659 --> 09:21.217
To the hunt.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.226
"The hunt"?

09:22.295 --> 09:24.126
For the Resistance.

09:24.196 --> 09:27.165
l shall take great pleasure
in tracking them down...

09:28.634 --> 09:30.829
and making the kill.

09:43.115 --> 09:44.776
Au revoir.

09:51.157 --> 09:52.920
How'd we do?

09:52.992 --> 09:55.654
lnsufficient
for a Saturday night.

09:55.728 --> 09:58.788
1, 247 francs
and 81 Reichsmarks.

09:58.864 --> 09:59.796
Well, it should be enough

09:59.865 --> 10:01.389
to buy an oscillator
to extend the range

10:01.467 --> 10:02.900
of our radio.

10:02.969 --> 10:04.937
First thing tomorrow
morning, l want you

10:05.004 --> 10:07.063
to take a little trip
to the countryside.

10:07.139 --> 10:09.539
There's a Monsieur Groleau
who has a cottage

10:09.609 --> 10:11.509
just past the third bridge.

10:11.577 --> 10:14.375
He's got a wine cellar
full of vacuum tubes.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.745
Tell him we need a high
frequency oscillator.

10:16.816 --> 10:17.976
Offer him 300 francs,

10:18.084 --> 10:19.847
but don't go any higher
than 500.

10:19.919 --> 10:21.784
We have more pressing needs.

10:21.854 --> 10:22.878
Such as?

10:22.955 --> 10:25.082
Explosives. We need
a launcher that can fire

10:25.157 --> 10:26.784
armor- piercing grenades.

10:26.859 --> 10:28.690
Planning on blowing
up a German tank?

10:28.761 --> 10:30.228
lf necessary.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.264
We're not trying
to build an army here.

10:32.331 --> 10:34.629
Well, maybe it's time we did.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.100
Three more German battalions
have occupied the city

10:37.169 --> 10:38.796
and a panzer division
is holding position

10:38.871 --> 10:40.566
1 1 kilometers away.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.767
When the Americans arrive
and the fighting begins,

10:42.842 --> 10:44.810
l don't intend to be standing
next to a piano

10:44.877 --> 10:46.674
singing"Moonlight Becomes You."

10:46.746 --> 10:48.008
The Americans won't even be able

10:48.080 --> 10:50.344
to approach this city
without our help.

10:50.416 --> 10:52.043
And if they can't
liberate Sainte Claire,

10:52.118 --> 10:54.279
the assault into
Germany could fail.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.048
We need to be
gathering information

10:56.122 --> 10:57.282
about German troop movements

10:57.356 --> 10:59.381
and relaying it
to Allied Command.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.392
l'm tired of lighting
the Nazis' cigarettes

11:01.494 --> 11:03.121
and laughing at their jokes.

11:03.162 --> 11:06.131
We should be helping the Allies
by assassinating these pigs.

11:06.198 --> 11:09.224
The moment we start shooting,
we expose ourselves.

11:09.301 --> 11:11.462
Right now, no one suspects us

11:11.537 --> 11:13.903
and l am not about to risk
our entire operation

11:13.973 --> 11:15.270
because you've
suddenly developed

11:15.341 --> 11:16.467
a nervous trigger finger.

11:16.642 --> 11:18.473
That is your opinion, madame.

11:18.544 --> 11:19.670
l'm the leader
of the movement here

11:19.745 --> 11:21.679
and right now, my opinion
is the only one that counts,

11:21.747 --> 11:23.112
so get the oscillator.

11:25.785 --> 11:28.276
l think we're all
feeling the strain.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.446
lt's been a hard four years,

11:29.522 --> 11:30.454
but believe me

11:30.523 --> 11:32.650
the Third Reich
is feeling it, too.

11:32.725 --> 11:34.989
We just have to hang on
a little while longer.

11:35.061 --> 11:37.325
Word from the Americans
is going to come any day.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.024
Perhaps.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.196
Again?

11:45.271 --> 11:47.239
Again.

11:47.306 --> 11:50.036
Why is she so adamant?

11:50.109 --> 11:52.475
What she's proposing
would put us all at risk.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.877
Maybe that's her intention.

11:54.947 --> 11:57.381
lf you have suspicions,
my old friend,

11:57.450 --> 11:58.508
let's hear them.

11:58.584 --> 12:00.779
From the beginning,
she's been argumentative

12:00.853 --> 12:02.582
and on more
than a few occasions,

12:02.655 --> 12:04.384
she's disobeyed
your direct orders.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.891
She's headstrong--
typical of the underground.

12:06.959 --> 12:10.395
Nevertheless, her behavior
has threatened our identities.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.863
She's the only
munitions expert we have

12:12.932 --> 12:14.729
and she can carry a tune.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.926
We need her.

12:16.001 --> 12:17.662
Let's keep our eye on her.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.467
Have her followed
for the next few days.

12:20.539 --> 12:23.337
lf she is a Nazi infiltrator,

12:23.409 --> 12:25.070
we'll have to eliminate her.

12:40.893 --> 12:41.917
Bonjour, madame!

12:41.994 --> 12:43.188
Bonjour, monsieur.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.261
Put it on my account.

12:49.335 --> 12:50.267
Whoo.

12:53.305 --> 12:54.499
Guten Tag.

12:54.573 --> 12:57.474
You...halt!

13:04.784 --> 13:06.775
Get off your vehicle.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.621
What are you transporting?

13:10.689 --> 13:13.249
Nothing but
the very essentials of life.

13:29.942 --> 13:31.739
Proceed to your destination.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.244
That l will.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.280
That l most certainly will.

13:35.347 --> 13:38.282
lf the choice were mine,

13:38.350 --> 13:40.341
you would already be dead.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.557
...all report rain.

13:50.629 --> 13:52.790
lt's currently
59 degrees in Dover

13:52.865 --> 13:54.924
with low fog across the Channel.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.934
Temperatures are expected
to range

13:57.002 --> 13:58.697
from a low of 45 degrees...

14:00.439 --> 14:01.906
Damn, l'm missing it.

14:04.910 --> 14:07.037
Our most recent intelligence

14:07.112 --> 14:10.172
shows two German armored
divisions here and here.

14:10.249 --> 14:11.682
How recent is this intelligence?

14:11.750 --> 14:13.650
- 48 hours.
- Old news.

14:13.719 --> 14:15.016
l am Reginald Smith

14:15.087 --> 14:17.817
and you're listening
to the British Radio Network.

14:17.890 --> 14:19.653
This report will repeat in...

14:19.725 --> 14:21.716
- 45 seconds.
- 45 seconds.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.261
Here's to English precision.

14:31.003 --> 14:32.561
We're closed.

14:32.638 --> 14:34.105
Morning delivery.

14:36.942 --> 14:38.910
You're late. What happened?

14:38.978 --> 14:40.502
Oh, just a little tete- a- tete

14:40.579 --> 14:42.240
with a member
of the Master Race.

14:42.314 --> 14:43.508
That's the second time
this week.

14:43.582 --> 14:45.447
Sound like they're increasing
their patrols.

14:45.517 --> 14:47.917
Perhaps it's time
we chose another courier.

14:47.987 --> 14:49.614
Our"baker"
is arousing suspicion.

14:49.688 --> 14:51.246
There's no need to worry.

14:51.323 --> 14:52.984
l change my route every day

14:53.058 --> 14:55.526
and l've become quite friendly
with most of the Gestapo.

14:55.594 --> 14:57.994
They just love my strudel.

14:58.063 --> 15:01.499
A kind thank you
to Jazzy McNulty and his band.

15:01.567 --> 15:06.129
Now, the weather for today,
September 22, 1944.

15:06.205 --> 15:07.729
ln London, skies are gray

15:07.806 --> 15:10.274
with a strong chance
of afternoon rain.

15:10.342 --> 15:12.867
Temperatures will range
from a low of 52 degrees

15:12.945 --> 15:14.913
to a high of 7 1.

15:15.014 --> 15:18.074
The northern coast reports
heavy rain and strong winds

15:18.150 --> 15:20.618
and ocean swells
reaching four feet.

15:20.686 --> 15:24.816
Devonshire, Hertfordshire
and Sonnenshire all report rain.

15:24.890 --> 15:27.381
lt's currently
59 degrees in Dover

15:27.459 --> 15:29.689
with low fog across the Channel.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.925
Temperatures are expected to
range from a low of 45 degrees

15:33.032 --> 15:34.932
to a high of 63.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.560
l am Reginald Smith,
and you are listening...

15:37.636 --> 15:38.568
Got it.

15:38.637 --> 15:40.366
Let's see the code key.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.373
Every fifth letter,
every third vowel.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.738
Use the Sunday
decryption sequence.

15:43.809 --> 15:44.901
Mm- hmm.

15:46.478 --> 15:48.673
"A..."

15:48.747 --> 15:49.975
"H...C."

15:50.049 --> 15:51.846
Straight
from Allied High Command.

15:51.917 --> 15:52.975
lt must be important.

15:53.085 --> 15:55.747
All messages regarding
the war are important.

15:55.821 --> 15:57.254
lt's only a matter of degree.

15:57.323 --> 15:58.915
l suppose you're right,
but do you have to be

15:58.991 --> 16:01.357
so...logical about everything?

16:01.427 --> 16:04.362
ln any covert battle,
logic is a potent weapon.

16:04.430 --> 16:05.362
You might try it sometime.

16:05.431 --> 16:08.264
"American Fourth lnfantry...

16:08.334 --> 16:11.792
"to invade Sainte Claire...

16:11.870 --> 16:12.837
Tuesday dawn."

16:12.905 --> 16:14.372
That's two days from now.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.603
"Require assistance.
Disable enemy communications.

16:17.676 --> 16:19.143
End message."

16:19.211 --> 16:22.112
The German radio transmitter
is housed at their headquarters.

16:22.181 --> 16:23.773
That building is
surrounded by guards.

16:23.849 --> 16:26.409
We can't just waltz in there
and plant a bomb.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.385
Maybe l can help.

16:28.454 --> 16:29.682
How?

16:29.755 --> 16:31.780
l'm upset.

16:31.857 --> 16:35.054
l need to see
my special"friend..."

16:35.127 --> 16:37.186
even if it means
bothering him at the office.

16:37.262 --> 16:38.854
A reconnaissance mission.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.193
l'll try to locate the radio,

16:40.265 --> 16:42.825
see where the guards are posted,
examine the locks,

16:42.901 --> 16:44.630
gather enough information
to get us inside.

16:44.703 --> 16:47.137
lt's too dangerous.

16:47.206 --> 16:48.195
lf you're caught,

16:48.273 --> 16:49.797
you'll be tortured
for information.

16:49.875 --> 16:51.934
You don't know my"friend."

16:52.011 --> 16:55.947
He would never do anything
to harm his own child.

16:58.650 --> 17:01.619
Encode a response
to Allied Command.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.951
Confirm that we've received
their message.

17:04.022 --> 17:07.015
Tell them we're proceeding
according to plan.

17:59.511 --> 18:01.342
Ever since my days
at the university,

18:01.447 --> 18:03.074
l've admired this painting...

18:05.117 --> 18:06.846
and now it's mine.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.945
Our fellow officers
might prefer gold or land,

18:10.022 --> 18:13.219
but, for me, the greatest
prize of war is art.

18:13.292 --> 18:16.261
Trophies of the hunt...

18:16.328 --> 18:17.989
but was the hunt fair?

18:18.063 --> 18:19.394
Sir?

18:19.465 --> 18:20.864
We entered this city
with superior firepower

18:20.933 --> 18:23.163
against a weakened prey.

18:23.235 --> 18:26.796
Do you really deserve
these...prizes?

18:26.872 --> 18:28.863
We are German.

18:28.974 --> 18:32.137
The German people deserve Europe
and everything in it.

18:32.211 --> 18:33.542
Why?

18:33.612 --> 18:35.637
Sir...

18:35.714 --> 18:37.147
You question our destiny?

18:37.216 --> 18:38.615
Of course not,

18:38.684 --> 18:41.676
but l want to hear it
in your own words.

18:41.753 --> 18:45.917
Tell me...
why are we the"Master Race"?

18:46.024 --> 18:48.925
Our blood is pure.

18:48.994 --> 18:52.430
Our people lived and hunted on
this land for a thousand years

18:52.498 --> 18:55.092
before the degenerate races
brought their corruption.

18:55.167 --> 18:58.159
Europe must be purified.

18:58.237 --> 18:59.499
You, yourself...

18:59.571 --> 19:02.335
are you stronger
than these"degenerate" races?

19:02.441 --> 19:03.373
More cunning?

19:03.408 --> 19:04.397
Yes, of course.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.808
And if you were alone
without an army supporting you,

19:06.879 --> 19:08.642
would you continue the hunt?

19:08.714 --> 19:10.238
lf your prey were armed

19:10.315 --> 19:12.545
instead of defenseless,
what then?

19:12.618 --> 19:14.017
Colonel, l don't know
what you're trying...

19:14.086 --> 19:16.850
You are superior to no one!

19:16.922 --> 19:21.325
Never underestimate your prey
or disrespect its abilities.

19:21.393 --> 19:24.851
lf you do, you will become
the hunted.

19:24.963 --> 19:27.488
When the opposing army
invades this city,

19:27.566 --> 19:29.500
remember my words.

19:31.670 --> 19:32.694
Enter!

19:36.008 --> 19:36.997
Brigitte!

19:37.075 --> 19:38.542
l'm sorry.

19:38.610 --> 19:41.306
l know l'm not supposed
to come here.

19:41.380 --> 19:42.711
Don't blame him.

19:42.781 --> 19:44.544
l told him l was ill,
that l had to see you.

19:45.884 --> 19:48.876
l will leave you two alone.

19:51.323 --> 19:52.449
Heil Hitler.

19:57.729 --> 19:59.253
lt's all right.

19:59.331 --> 20:01.731
The colonel is in
a strange mood today.

20:06.638 --> 20:08.299
What's wrong?
ls it our child?

20:08.373 --> 20:09.533
l don't know.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.075
l was dizzy.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.110
l'll call the doctor.

20:12.177 --> 20:13.508
No!

20:13.579 --> 20:15.672
l feel better now.

20:15.747 --> 20:18.181
Maybe l just needed to see you.

20:18.250 --> 20:21.845
Why haven't you
shown me this place before?

20:21.920 --> 20:24.320
l didn't want your neighbors
to see you coming here.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.323
They make it
difficult enough for you,

20:26.391 --> 20:27.415
knowing we're together.

20:27.492 --> 20:29.926
l don't care what they think.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.292
lt's beautiful.

20:33.365 --> 20:37.233
Praxiteles, master sculptor
of ancient Greece.

20:37.302 --> 20:41.170
There are only three
like this in all of Europe.

20:41.240 --> 20:45.233
So many...
wonderful things.

20:51.283 --> 20:52.750
The commandant would
have us continue

20:52.818 --> 20:55.343
this simulation until we rot.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.149
lt's pointless.

20:57.222 --> 20:58.655
We should begin the hunt.

20:58.724 --> 21:01.522
He believes we must learn
more about our prey,

21:01.593 --> 21:04.061
but l have learned enough.

21:06.131 --> 21:07.860
Ready your weapon.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.234
Avoid the cranium.

21:22.881 --> 21:23.905
This way!

21:23.982 --> 21:25.074
The message!

21:25.150 --> 21:26.242
There's no time.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.740
Ah!

22:02.821 --> 22:06.655
Computer, exit holodeck.

22:06.725 --> 22:08.249
We'll take them
to the medical bay.

22:16.568 --> 22:19.196
This neural interface
has been damaged.

22:19.271 --> 22:20.397
That's because it
took a direct hit

22:20.472 --> 22:22.633
when one of your bullets
grazed the base of her skull.

22:22.708 --> 22:24.938
l'll provide you with another--
install it.

22:25.043 --> 22:26.305
Not until l've repaired
her injuries.

22:26.378 --> 22:27.436
How long?

22:27.512 --> 22:29.036
She has two fractured vertebrae

22:29.114 --> 22:31.241
and a punctured lung--
another hour at least.

22:31.316 --> 22:32.283
Him?

22:32.351 --> 22:33.511
l've stabilized
his vital systems,

22:33.585 --> 22:35.416
but he still has
bullet fragments

22:35.487 --> 22:36.818
lodged in his shoulder.

22:36.888 --> 22:37.877
l will treat him.

22:37.956 --> 22:39.924
This time, you might
do a better job

22:39.991 --> 22:41.822
repairing
the muscle lacerations.

22:41.893 --> 22:43.155
The last crew member
you treated

22:43.228 --> 22:44.923
was brought back in
with internal bleeding.

22:44.996 --> 22:46.588
Your crew is fragile.

22:46.665 --> 22:48.428
They fall too easily.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.626
What do you expect?

22:49.701 --> 22:51.999
They've been stabbed,
shot, beaten, phasered

22:52.104 --> 22:53.696
and bat'lethed
over the past three weeks.

22:53.772 --> 22:55.740
Their bodies weren't designed
for this kind of punishment.

22:55.807 --> 22:56.831
What happened?

22:56.908 --> 22:58.876
These prey were hunted
by Turanj.

22:58.944 --> 23:00.571
Their injuries are severe.

23:00.679 --> 23:01.907
You assured me that your people

23:01.947 --> 23:03.676
would avoid causing
serious head injuries.

23:03.749 --> 23:04.738
Another centimeter

23:04.816 --> 23:06.909
and the bullet would have
penetrated her brain.

23:07.018 --> 23:08.315
lf you can't keep
your people under control,

23:08.387 --> 23:10.184
then you should put an end
to this blood sport.

23:10.255 --> 23:12.246
The simulations will continue.

23:12.324 --> 23:14.349
At least activate the holodeck
safety protocols.

23:14.426 --> 23:15.290
No.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.691
lt'll prevent
life- threatening injuries,

23:16.762 --> 23:17.751
for your people as well.

23:17.829 --> 23:20.491
lt will also eliminate
the challenge.

23:20.565 --> 23:23.432
l have had 28 wounded
and one fatality

23:23.502 --> 23:25.197
in the past 12 hours.

23:25.270 --> 23:27.636
Even l can't keep up
with that level of triage.

23:27.706 --> 23:30.140
You will keep up
or they will die.

23:30.208 --> 23:32.676
Their lives are in your hands,
Doctor.

23:32.744 --> 23:34.405
Don't fail them.

23:40.952 --> 23:44.615
When that one is ready
place him in Holodeck 2.

23:44.689 --> 23:46.884
Let's see how he fares
with the Klingons.

23:46.958 --> 23:48.255
What about her?

23:48.326 --> 23:49.691
Send her back to Holodeck 1.

23:49.761 --> 23:52.127
l like her voice.

24:01.072 --> 24:02.869
Progress?

24:02.941 --> 24:06.069
By cutting through the bulkheads
on Decks 4, 5 and 6,

24:06.144 --> 24:09.443
we've been able to expand
both holodeck grids

24:09.514 --> 24:11.345
by 5, 000 square meters.

24:11.416 --> 24:12.815
More.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.620
l can't give you any more--

24:17.689 --> 24:20.317
not without compromising
Voyager's primary systems.

24:20.392 --> 24:21.916
Then compromise them.

24:21.993 --> 24:24.826
Look, holodecks require
a tremendous amount of energy.

24:24.896 --> 24:27.831
l've already rerouted power
from all nonessential systems.

24:27.899 --> 24:31.198
Anything more, and we'll start
losing propulsion, deflectors

24:31.269 --> 24:32.793
even life support.

24:32.871 --> 24:35.931
l'll transfer a supply
of power nodules from my vessel.

24:36.074 --> 24:38.042
lntegrate them
into your systems.

24:38.109 --> 24:39.906
l want to expand
the holo- projectors

24:39.978 --> 24:41.570
into all surrounding sections.

24:41.646 --> 24:44.171
Replicate enough emitters
for the task.

24:46.351 --> 24:47.943
Yes, sir.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.591
The holo- emitters
in this corridor are stable.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.397
Let's start working
on Section 19.

25:07.939 --> 25:10.772
But first, tell the guard
to escort you to Engineering

25:10.842 --> 25:13.174
that we need more equipment--

25:13.245 --> 25:15.770
specifically,
a type- 3 isolinear emitter.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.109
lf he gives you any trouble,

25:17.182 --> 25:20.345
say"l can't complete
the assignment without it."

25:22.888 --> 25:25.322
We need an isolinear
emitter from Engineering.

25:41.573 --> 25:43.541
Ensign, how did l get here?

25:43.608 --> 25:44.632
l transferred you here

25:44.709 --> 25:46.267
using the new emitters
in this section.

25:46.344 --> 25:47.436
l assume you've got a plan?

25:47.512 --> 25:48.479
Half a plan.

25:48.547 --> 25:49.639
Let's hear it.

25:49.714 --> 25:51.773
Before we can retake the ship,
we've got to get the crew back.

25:51.850 --> 25:54.148
And that means disabling
the neural interfaces.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.652
Easier said than done.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.517
The great hunters are
everywhere you turn.

25:57.589 --> 25:58.954
Don't worry.

25:59.024 --> 26:00.821
l think l've found a way to tap

26:00.926 --> 26:02.826
into the Sick Bay
diagnostic console.

26:02.861 --> 26:04.488
The only catch is...

26:07.699 --> 26:08.723
Stand by with the emitter.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.767
l'm almost done here.

26:14.706 --> 26:15.968
The catch, Ensign?

26:16.041 --> 26:18.009
Somebody's got to be
inside the holodeck

26:18.076 --> 26:19.907
to engage
the Bridge control relays.

26:19.978 --> 26:20.910
We're shorthanded.

26:21.012 --> 26:21.979
l know.

26:22.047 --> 26:24.777
Well, we've got a Borg
on board, don't we?

26:24.849 --> 26:26.316
Maybe we can put her
to good use.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.581
l have been studying
Voyager's database

26:34.659 --> 26:36.786
looking for our next simulation.

26:36.861 --> 26:38.726
There are many to choose from.

26:38.797 --> 26:41.425
These people have
a violent history.

26:41.499 --> 26:45.026
l believe l've found
a worthy prey:

26:45.103 --> 26:47.503
the Borg.

26:47.572 --> 26:49.972
When World War ll is over,

26:50.041 --> 26:51.975
we will recreate
a notorious battle

26:52.077 --> 26:54.341
known as"Wolf 359."

26:54.412 --> 26:55.743
l look forward to it.

26:55.814 --> 26:57.247
l thought you might,

26:57.315 --> 26:59.215
but if you continue
to disobey me,

26:59.284 --> 27:01.445
this is one hunt
you will never see.

27:01.553 --> 27:04.886
You nearly destroyed
two of my favored prey.

27:04.923 --> 27:06.049
You were careless.

27:06.124 --> 27:07.716
l've become impatient.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.657
We penetrated this vessel,

27:09.728 --> 27:12.128
overcame their defenses

27:12.197 --> 27:15.860
and in the moment of the kill,
you forced us to stop.

27:15.934 --> 27:20.598
Now we play
these incessant games.

27:20.672 --> 27:24.699
lt's time we took our trophies
and moved on.

27:24.776 --> 27:27.210
Your lust for the kill
has blinded you

27:27.278 --> 27:29.644
like many young hunters.

27:29.714 --> 27:32.410
lf you took the time
to study your prey,

27:32.484 --> 27:35.282
to understand its behavior,
you might learn something.

27:35.353 --> 27:37.878
There is nothing to be learned.

27:37.956 --> 27:39.253
You're wrong.

27:39.324 --> 27:42.191
Each prey exposes us
to another way of life

27:42.260 --> 27:44.558
and makes us reevaluate
our own.

27:44.629 --> 27:46.187
Have you considered our future?

27:46.264 --> 27:47.458
What will become of us

27:47.532 --> 27:50.262
when we have hunted
this territory to exhaustion?

27:50.335 --> 27:52.826
We will travel
to another part of space,

27:52.904 --> 27:56.101
search for new prey
as we have always done.

27:56.174 --> 27:59.632
A way of life that hasn't
changed for a thousand years.

27:59.711 --> 28:01.178
Why should it?

28:01.279 --> 28:04.339
Species that don't change...

28:04.382 --> 28:05.906
die.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.315
We've lost our way.

28:11.389 --> 28:15.291
We've allowed our predatory
instincts to dominate us.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.658
We disperse ourselves
throughout the Quadrant,

28:17.729 --> 28:20.391
sending ships in all directions.

28:20.465 --> 28:24.196
We've become
a solitary race, isolated.

28:24.269 --> 28:27.102
We've spread ourselves
too thin.

28:27.172 --> 28:29.367
We're no longer a culture.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.500
We have no identity.

28:31.576 --> 28:34.238
ln another thousand years,

28:34.312 --> 28:37.110
no one will remember
the name"Hirogen."

28:37.182 --> 28:40.413
Our people must
come back together,

28:40.485 --> 28:44.353
combine forces,
rebuild our civilization.

28:44.422 --> 28:45.787
What of the hunt?

28:45.857 --> 28:48.189
The hunt will always continue

28:48.259 --> 28:50.193
but in a new way.

28:50.261 --> 28:53.856
l intend to transform this ship
into a vast simulation

28:53.932 --> 28:58.164
populated with a varied
and endless supply of prey.

28:58.236 --> 29:00.864
ln time, this technology
can be duplicated

29:00.939 --> 29:03.032
for other Hirogen.

29:03.108 --> 29:07.738
These holodecks will allow us
to hold onto our past

29:07.812 --> 29:10.007
while we face the future.

29:10.081 --> 29:13.847
Even if l were persuaded,
others wouldn't be.

29:13.952 --> 29:15.817
Then you are with me.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.316
l must continue my research.

29:21.392 --> 29:23.519
l'll see you tomorrow
on Holodeck 1.

29:23.595 --> 29:26.155
The Americans are due to invade.

29:40.145 --> 29:42.113
Remain calm and stay quiet.

29:42.180 --> 29:43.772
There's a Hirogen
working in the bio- lab.

29:43.848 --> 29:44.780
He might hear us.

29:44.849 --> 29:47.010
What's the last
thing you remember?

29:47.085 --> 29:48.484
An attack.

29:48.553 --> 29:49.850
The Hirogen vessels--

29:49.921 --> 29:52.219
they breached our hull
and boarded the ship.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.884
l was in a phaser fight
on Deck 3.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.221
l was struck several times.

29:56.294 --> 29:57.352
That's all l remember.

29:57.428 --> 29:58.395
Then you have no memory

29:58.463 --> 29:59.930
of the simulations
in the holodeck?

29:59.998 --> 30:01.295
None.

30:01.366 --> 30:02.298
The neural interface

30:02.367 --> 30:04.062
must be circumventing
your memory centers.

30:04.135 --> 30:05.193
Neural interface?

30:05.270 --> 30:06.635
lt's a subdermal transmitter

30:06.704 --> 30:08.831
that links your neocortex
to the holodeck.

30:08.907 --> 30:10.397
ln essence,
it makes you believe

30:10.475 --> 30:12.170
you're a character
within the program.

30:12.243 --> 30:14.473
Why am l in Sick Bay?

30:14.546 --> 30:16.776
You were wounded
in the simulation.

30:16.848 --> 30:21.512
lt's my job to patch you
all up and send you back in.

30:21.586 --> 30:24.384
Half the crew is
under lock and key.

30:24.455 --> 30:26.980
The rest are fighting for
their lives on the holodeck.

30:27.058 --> 30:29.083
This has been going
on for 19 days--

30:29.160 --> 30:32.288
dozens of battle scenarios,
one more brutal than the next.

30:32.363 --> 30:35.230
You should see what a mess
you were after the Crusades.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.325
Will l be sent
into another simulation?

30:37.402 --> 30:40.496
Yes, but this time...
with an advantage.

30:43.908 --> 30:46.001
l have found a way
to disable the interface

30:46.144 --> 30:47.771
by remodulating
one of your Borg implants

30:47.846 --> 30:50.246
to emit a jamming signal.

30:50.315 --> 30:52.749
Once the Hirogen have brought
you back to the holodeck,

30:52.817 --> 30:54.808
the jamming signal
will activate within seconds.

30:54.886 --> 30:56.376
My objective?

30:56.454 --> 30:58.479
You must find a control panel
inside the holodeck

30:58.556 --> 31:00.421
and engage
the Bridge access relays.

31:00.525 --> 31:01.856
That will enable
Ensign Kim and me

31:01.893 --> 31:04.054
to deactivate
all the neural interfaces.

31:04.128 --> 31:06.323
After Captain Janeway
and the crew regain awareness,

31:06.397 --> 31:07.887
you can work with them
to mount a resistance

31:07.966 --> 31:09.365
against the Hirogen.

31:09.434 --> 31:11.095
What simulation
will l be entering?

31:11.169 --> 31:13.933
World War ll--
a 20th century Earth conflict.

31:14.005 --> 31:15.131
Do you know anything about it?

31:15.206 --> 31:16.173
Nothing.

31:16.241 --> 31:17.606
That could be a problem.

31:17.675 --> 31:20.109
Once the interface is disabled,
you won't remember anything

31:20.178 --> 31:21.907
about your role
in the simulation.

31:21.980 --> 31:24.210
Think of it
as a new social setting.

31:24.282 --> 31:25.977
Do your best to fit in.

31:27.318 --> 31:28.979
This is the last
neural interface.

31:29.053 --> 31:31.647
When you've finished with her,
you'll help me replicate more.

31:33.391 --> 31:35.586
l have to sedate you now.

31:49.374 --> 31:55.938
That old black magic
has me in its spell

31:56.014 --> 32:02.715
That old black magic
that you weave so well

32:02.787 --> 32:09.488
Those icy fingers
up and down my spine

32:09.560 --> 32:14.259
The same old witchcraft
when your eyes meet...

32:22.540 --> 32:25.532
l must discontinue
this activity.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.100
l am not well.

32:31.482 --> 32:33.313
lf the entertainment
is over, l'll be going.

32:33.384 --> 32:34.408
Stay right there, Commandant.

32:34.485 --> 32:36.419
l'm sure she's fine.

32:36.487 --> 32:38.455
Let me talk to her.

32:40.758 --> 32:42.589
What's wrong?

32:42.660 --> 32:44.150
l require a glass of water.

32:44.228 --> 32:45.320
Make it a quick one.

32:45.396 --> 32:47.762
l promised the commandant
you'd be singing till midnight.

32:47.832 --> 32:50.130
l want to get a lot of
information out of him tonight.

32:50.201 --> 32:51.190
l am ill.

32:51.269 --> 32:52.998
Look, l don't care
if you're dying.

32:53.104 --> 32:54.571
Get back out there.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.869
l won't.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.410
Maybe you're right about her.

33:04.482 --> 33:06.677
The evidence is increasing.

33:06.751 --> 33:07.809
She was present today

33:07.885 --> 33:10.285
when our courier was
shot down in the street,

33:10.355 --> 33:12.448
yet somehow, she was unharmed.

33:12.523 --> 33:15.458
And now, on the eve
of our liberation,

33:15.526 --> 33:17.460
she becomes uncooperative.

33:17.528 --> 33:18.859
Leave this to me.

33:31.809 --> 33:33.800
Captain...

33:33.878 --> 33:35.846
At ease.
What's the word?

33:35.913 --> 33:38.438
There is no word, at least
not from the Resistance

33:38.516 --> 33:39.949
in Sainte Claire.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.179
Then we won't get any support
from inside the city.

33:42.253 --> 33:43.185
You may be underestimating

33:43.254 --> 33:44.812
the good citizens
of Sainte Claire.

33:44.889 --> 33:46.550
l spent a summer there
when l was 18.

33:46.624 --> 33:47.852
Let me guess.

33:47.925 --> 33:50.519
You ate a few snails,
fell in love with a local girl

33:50.595 --> 33:52.324
and became an expert
on the city.

33:52.397 --> 33:55.525
Uh...well...

33:55.600 --> 33:57.465
Yeah, pretty much like that.

33:57.535 --> 33:58.729
l see.

33:58.803 --> 34:01.271
But believe me, Captain,
those people love their town.

34:01.372 --> 34:02.862
They'll fight for it
and die for it.

34:02.907 --> 34:04.875
Don't count them out yet.

34:05.910 --> 34:07.537
All right,

34:07.612 --> 34:09.876
but l won't count
them in, either.

34:09.947 --> 34:11.437
We continue as planned--

34:11.516 --> 34:13.484
an assault from the north
at first light.

34:15.753 --> 34:19.449
So...who was the mademoiselle?

34:22.659 --> 34:24.650
Her name was Brigitte.

34:24.728 --> 34:26.492
Great gams.

34:26.563 --> 34:27.757
One hell of a temper.

34:27.831 --> 34:29.322
Sounds like your kind of girl.

34:31.069 --> 34:36.905
August 29, 1936...12:17 P. M.

34:36.974 --> 34:39.498
That's when my train
pulled out of Sainte Claire.

34:40.911 --> 34:42.436
That's the last time l saw her.

34:42.513 --> 34:45.676
We wrote to each other
every week for three years.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.445
Then the war broke out

34:47.518 --> 34:49.418
and l never heard
from her again.

34:49.487 --> 34:51.216
Sainte Claire's not a big place.

34:51.289 --> 34:53.416
She shouldn't be
too hard to find.

34:53.491 --> 34:54.856
l'm counting on it.

34:58.396 --> 35:01.229
You'll maintain position here,
20 meters from the front doors.

35:01.332 --> 35:03.061
Arm yourself
with a submachine gun

35:03.101 --> 35:04.864
and watch
for any sign of trouble.

35:04.936 --> 35:05.868
Understood.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.427
Now, we've observed
a 20- second break

35:07.505 --> 35:09.370
in the guard rotation
at 4:15 A. M.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.771
That should give you
and me enough time

35:10.842 --> 35:11.809
to enter the building

35:11.876 --> 35:13.343
through the storm window
on the eastern wall.

35:13.411 --> 35:14.708
When l was there yesterday,

35:14.779 --> 35:17.009
l saw guards posted
at all three stairways.

35:17.081 --> 35:18.514
So you'll have to reach
the second floor

35:18.583 --> 35:19.607
through the elevator shaft.

35:19.684 --> 35:21.311
The command post is
in the main gallery

35:21.385 --> 35:22.374
at the end of the hall.

35:22.453 --> 35:24.318
Once inside,
we plant the charges;

35:24.388 --> 35:25.548
load the transmitter.

35:25.623 --> 35:27.022
You'll remain here.

35:27.091 --> 35:28.524
lf something goes wrong
and we're caught,

35:28.593 --> 35:30.561
destroy all evidence
of the underground--

35:30.628 --> 35:33.392
our contact lists,
decryption codes-- everything.

35:33.464 --> 35:34.396
Right.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.023
We leave in one hour.

35:47.078 --> 35:49.342
This won't make much of a bang.

35:49.413 --> 35:51.711
You forgot to connect
the detonator.

35:51.782 --> 35:53.943
l will correct the error.

35:54.018 --> 35:55.485
lt's lucky l found
your little error.

35:55.553 --> 35:56.986
lt might have
undermined our mission.

35:57.054 --> 35:58.954
Are you having second
thoughts about tonight?

35:59.023 --> 36:00.081
No.

36:00.191 --> 36:01.715
Good, because l don't
want any more mistakes.

36:01.759 --> 36:03.192
There won't be any.

36:03.261 --> 36:04.728
Let's hope not.

36:19.911 --> 36:21.503
We've got to stop
meeting like this.

36:21.579 --> 36:23.547
l managed to grab
a quick scan of Holodeck 1

36:23.614 --> 36:25.445
and it looks like
Seven of Nine is on the move.

36:25.516 --> 36:27.040
Are you ready in Sick Bay?

36:27.118 --> 36:29.678
My Hirogen taskmaster is
working in the bio- lab.

36:29.754 --> 36:31.051
l'll have access
to the medical console

36:31.122 --> 36:32.714
for another 20 minutes at least.

36:32.790 --> 36:34.587
That'll give me enough time
to get to the Bridge and...

36:38.930 --> 36:40.488
Good afternoon.

36:40.565 --> 36:42.556
What are you doing in here?

36:42.633 --> 36:45.101
Trying to get the replicator
system back on line...

36:45.169 --> 36:47.831
unless you prefer
the emergency rations.

36:47.905 --> 36:51.068
Personally, l'm getting
tired of synthetic protein.

36:51.142 --> 36:54.168
You're supposed to be the
finest hunters in the Quadrant.

36:54.245 --> 36:57.112
Why don't you find us
something a little more tasty?

36:57.181 --> 36:59.615
Something wrong?

36:59.684 --> 37:02.847
An unauthorized transmission
was sent from this room.

37:02.954 --> 37:04.512
What kind of transmission?

37:04.589 --> 37:06.022
l don't know.

37:06.090 --> 37:07.955
Maybe you can tell me.

37:08.025 --> 37:11.017
Well...l was trying
to reroute power

37:11.095 --> 37:13.222
from the main computer
to the replicators.

37:13.297 --> 37:15.663
Oh, of course.

37:15.733 --> 37:18.998
l must have tripped
a communications subroutine.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.594
Sorry about that.

37:20.671 --> 37:21.968
Didn't mean to worry you.

37:22.039 --> 37:23.870
Your people have damaged

37:23.941 --> 37:25.909
just about every system
on this vessel.

37:26.010 --> 37:26.977
Accidents are bound to happen.

37:27.044 --> 37:30.275
Now, if you don't mind,
l'm due on the Bridge.

37:30.348 --> 37:31.576
Show it to me.

37:31.649 --> 37:32.581
What?

37:32.650 --> 37:34.743
l want to see this subroutine.

37:34.819 --> 37:38.118
Show me what you were doing
when the"accident" occurred.

37:38.189 --> 37:39.656
Forget it.

37:39.724 --> 37:41.419
l don't have time.

37:44.061 --> 37:46.529
Do as l say.

37:46.597 --> 37:47.757
All right!

37:50.968 --> 37:52.902
But you'd better
call the Bridge.

37:52.970 --> 37:56.428
Tell your superior
l'm going to be late--

37:56.507 --> 37:59.704
that l'm working
under your orders now, not his.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.938
Go ahead.

38:02.046 --> 38:03.843
Make the call.

38:03.881 --> 38:06.145
l don't want to take the blame
for this.

38:09.687 --> 38:11.985
Report to the Bridge.

38:12.056 --> 38:14.251
Thanks.

39:08.446 --> 39:11.176
Set the charges here,
here and there.

39:13.484 --> 39:14.712
This looks like a message

39:14.785 --> 39:16.719
from one of their
reconnaissance teams.

39:26.297 --> 39:30.256
These must be instructions
for troop deployments.

39:30.334 --> 39:34.100
The Germans must be taking up
new positions outside the city.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.633
lt looks like they're mobilizing

39:38.709 --> 39:41.303
more troops than our sources
originally expected.

40:27.191 --> 40:29.716
They're moving armored units
into the valley.

40:31.862 --> 40:33.989
They must know
the Americans are coming.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.156
We've got to warn them somehow.

40:37.668 --> 40:38.657
What are you doing?

40:40.871 --> 40:43.203
You haven't set the charges.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.935
What is that?

40:45.009 --> 40:47.170
l believe it is a transmitter.

40:47.244 --> 40:49.371
l'm attempting to disable it.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.415
You're sending a message
to the Nazis.

40:51.482 --> 40:52.312
No.

40:52.383 --> 40:53.645
Step away

40:53.717 --> 40:55.150
or l'll kill you.

40:55.219 --> 40:56.811
What are you doing?

40:56.887 --> 40:58.878
Uh, nothing.
Just running a diagnostic...

40:58.956 --> 41:00.719
You've accessed
the neural interface controls.

41:00.825 --> 41:01.917
Stop it immediately.

41:01.959 --> 41:04.120
l told you-- no more mistakes.

41:04.195 --> 41:06.129
You've just made your last one.

41:17.308 --> 41:18.900
Seven.

41:18.976 --> 41:21.342
Captain.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.172
Listen.

41:25.483 --> 41:26.507
A targ...

41:26.584 --> 41:28.347
just beyond that ridge.

41:28.419 --> 41:29.852
You would hunt down
a simple beast

41:29.920 --> 41:31.319
even in the midst
of our enemies?

41:31.388 --> 41:33.515
There is no enemy
as great as hunger!

41:36.060 --> 41:37.823
Why am l being interrupted?

41:37.895 --> 41:39.089
The holographic Doctor--

41:39.163 --> 41:41.188
he's disabled
their Captain's interface.

41:41.265 --> 41:42.357
How?

41:42.433 --> 41:44.367
l don't know, but l can't
reestablish the link.

41:44.435 --> 41:45.697
Send a team to Holodeck 1.

41:45.769 --> 41:47.327
Remove her from the simulation.

42:03.287 --> 42:04.777
Hirogen hunters.

42:04.855 --> 42:07.722
lnternal scans show 13 of them
on this holodeck.

42:18.502 --> 42:20.026
Need a hand, buddy?

42:21.372 --> 42:23.533
Captain Miller,
Fifth Armored lnfantry.

42:23.607 --> 42:26.075
Welcome to Sainte Claire.

42:26.143 --> 42:27.576
Get me Artillery Unit
Charlie One.

42:27.645 --> 42:29.476
Take up positions
along this street

42:29.547 --> 42:30.980
and start laying down fire.

42:35.319 --> 42:37.913
The Americans have arrived.

42:37.988 --> 42:39.956
You circumvented our control!

42:40.024 --> 42:41.286
How?

42:41.358 --> 42:43.258
Go to hell!

42:43.327 --> 42:45.591
Spread out!

43:04.448 --> 43:05.779
Bobby.

43:09.286 --> 43:11.618
You owe me a postcard.

43:12.756 --> 43:14.121
Distance: 800 yards.

43:14.191 --> 43:16.659
Correct for crosswinds.
Fire at will.

43:16.727 --> 43:18.092
Take cover, boys!

43:18.162 --> 43:20.460
Charlie One isn't
known for accuracy!

43:20.531 --> 43:22.556
l can't access
the ship's systems.

43:25.469 --> 43:27.164
Didn't you say this
was Nazi headquarters?

43:27.237 --> 43:28.169
l did.

43:28.238 --> 43:29.170
Then it would stand to reason

43:29.239 --> 43:30.263
this building
is being targeted.

43:30.341 --> 43:31.308
Let's get out of here.

43:41.952 --> 43:44.420
What happened?

43:44.488 --> 43:46.979
There was a simulated explosion
in Holodeck 1.

43:47.091 --> 43:49.321
Somehow it blew out the
holo- grid across three decks.

43:49.393 --> 43:51.190
ls the program still running?

43:51.261 --> 43:52.660
Yes.

44:12.383 --> 44:13.850
What is it?

44:13.917 --> 44:15.714
lt looks like a bunker.

44:18.222 --> 44:19.553
All units, listen up.

44:19.623 --> 44:20.783
We've just blown the lid

44:20.858 --> 44:22.917
off of some kind
of secret Nazi compound.

44:22.993 --> 44:24.585
Converge on my position.

44:24.662 --> 44:25.924
We're going in.

44:28.365 --> 44:30.765
The breach opened the simulation
into the surrounding sections.

44:30.834 --> 44:33.268
l'm picking up holographic
soldiers moving onto Deck 5.

44:33.337 --> 44:37.296
Shut down the holo- emitters
until we can regain control.

44:37.374 --> 44:40.366
l can't. The program
controls are off- line.

44:41.745 --> 44:43.576
You wanted a war?

44:43.647 --> 44:45.342
Looks like you've got one.

44:54.792 --> 44:56.657
Take your positions
on the double.

44:56.727 --> 44:58.024
All right, sir.

44:59.430 --> 45:01.159
Circle to the left.
