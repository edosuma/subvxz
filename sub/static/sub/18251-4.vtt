WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:04.105
Woman:
Wayne, I think we're lost.

00:04.138 --> 00:06.174
Shouldn't we just ask
for directions?
No, no, no, no, no,

00:06.207 --> 00:07.708
we're not lost,
I can remember

00:07.741 --> 00:09.777
from the last time
we were here.

00:09.810 --> 00:10.744
Hi!

00:13.114 --> 00:15.716
Can you believe
that our Bruce is
getting married?

00:15.749 --> 00:17.085
Yeah.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.353
You know, I remember
when I used to
change his diaper

00:19.387 --> 00:22.656
and his little peeper
used to stick straight out!

00:22.690 --> 00:26.127
Shh, Nancy, shush.
Come on.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.629
We should have
asked for a map
from the hotel.

00:28.662 --> 00:31.199
Oh no, we don't need a map.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.601
Men have a natural
sense of direction.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.703
It's just that
the names of
these streets...

00:35.736 --> 00:37.438
I mean, look at that one,
it's...

00:37.471 --> 00:40.208
Marycockscochngatan...

00:40.241 --> 00:42.110
I mean, really,
is that a word?

00:42.143 --> 00:44.545
Who can speak a language
like this? My God.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.280
I don't remember
it being so cold

00:46.314 --> 00:47.681
when we were here last time.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.784
Yeah, well,
it's winter, honey.

00:50.818 --> 00:53.754
This is crazy.
I'm going to ask someone.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.656
Excuse me,

00:55.689 --> 00:58.292
do you know
where Bruce lives?

00:58.326 --> 01:00.394
The American.

01:00.428 --> 01:03.197
* We're not living in America

01:03.231 --> 01:06.734
* But we're not sorry

01:06.767 --> 01:08.502
* I knew there was something

01:08.536 --> 01:10.604
* That we never had

01:10.638 --> 01:13.507
* We don't worry

01:13.541 --> 01:16.844
* No, we're not
living in America *

01:16.877 --> 01:20.648
* But we're not sorry, no

01:20.681 --> 01:24.152
* We don't care
about the world today *

01:24.185 --> 01:26.887
* We're not sorry

01:26.920 --> 01:28.522
* For you

01:30.057 --> 01:34.195
* For my baby, baby,
baby, baby *

01:34.228 --> 01:35.196
* Ahh

01:37.531 --> 01:39.433
(Doorbell ringing)

01:41.735 --> 01:44.037
We were wondering
if you'd like to buy
some encyclopedias.

01:44.071 --> 01:47.074
(Laughter)

01:47.107 --> 01:50.043
Honey, it's us!

01:50.077 --> 01:51.078
Yeah, I can see that.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.014
(Laughing)

01:54.047 --> 01:57.718
Nancy:
Oh my gosh, look at this place!

01:57.751 --> 01:59.052
Good to see you.
Yep.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.288
I'll take this for you.
Here you go.

02:00.321 --> 02:01.789
Honey, take your shoes off.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.424
That's what they do.
I'm not taking
my shoes off.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.025
That's what
they do in Sweden!
I told you...

02:05.058 --> 02:06.660
what... Next it's
a group bath, right?

02:06.694 --> 02:07.928
Come on.
No.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.663
Where is she,
my sweet girl?
Hey-y-y!

02:09.697 --> 02:11.565
Oh, look at you!

02:11.599 --> 02:13.133
My sweet Emma,
you look great!

02:13.167 --> 02:14.868
Oh, thank you, so do you!

02:14.902 --> 02:16.270
Hi Wayne,
how are you?
Hi, hi.

02:16.304 --> 02:17.838
I'm good.
Are those new glasses?

02:17.871 --> 02:19.407
Emma:
Yeah!
I love them.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.309
They make you
look so smart!

02:21.342 --> 02:22.543
Oh, thank you.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.945
We're so excited
about the engagement.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.515
And we have
a little surprise.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.016
(Gasp)
First, um,

02:29.049 --> 02:30.851
little drink?
Just warm us up first.

02:30.884 --> 02:31.919
Definitely.

02:31.952 --> 02:34.522
Where's our room,
by the way?

02:34.555 --> 02:37.358
Thought you
guys were staying
at the hotel?

02:37.391 --> 02:38.592
(Laughter)

02:38.626 --> 02:40.127
Nancy:
We're kidding!

02:40.160 --> 02:41.962
We're moving in!
Did you see the
look on his face?

02:41.995 --> 02:43.364
We're not,
we're not.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.932
Nancy:
Of course we're
staying at the hotel

02:44.965 --> 02:46.133
you silly Gus!

02:46.166 --> 02:47.535
Honey, look at
this view, huh?

02:47.568 --> 02:49.102
It's like a postcard.

02:49.136 --> 02:53.774
(Music)

02:53.807 --> 02:55.709
(In Swedish)

03:27.541 --> 03:37.084
(Music)

03:37.117 --> 03:40.053
(Speaking in Swedish)

04:13.086 --> 04:20.294
(Music)

04:20.328 --> 04:21.562
All right.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.096
Now for the big news.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.932
We've decided...

04:24.965 --> 04:26.767
we want to pay
for the wedding.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.302
What? No!
Yes!

04:28.336 --> 04:29.470
No! I mean,

04:29.503 --> 04:31.439
thank you so much,
but we couldn't.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.640
Yes!
No!

04:32.673 --> 04:34.908
They're saying no,
but they mean yes.

04:34.942 --> 04:35.943
No!

04:35.976 --> 04:37.345
All right,
then that's settled now.

04:37.378 --> 04:40.614
We understand the issue
of where to have the wedding.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.416
And we want you to know

04:42.450 --> 04:43.751
there are two choices,

04:43.784 --> 04:45.319
but this is your decision.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.755
Yes, it's up to you.
Whatever you want.

04:47.788 --> 04:48.956
Option number one

04:48.989 --> 04:50.190
would be to have the wedding

04:50.223 --> 04:53.126
in our local church
in Willard, Ohio.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.895
Nancy:
Which of course
is our preference.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.430
Wayne:
Option number two

04:56.464 --> 04:58.532
would be to
have the wedding

04:58.566 --> 05:02.202
in another local church
just outside of town.

05:02.235 --> 05:04.505
Right. This church
is in Celeryville.

05:04.538 --> 05:07.207
Now that's about
a seven minute drive
for our guests,

05:07.240 --> 05:08.476
and you know
your Auntie Claire

05:08.509 --> 05:09.943
does not like
to travel.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.245
Yeah, so it's really
not an option at all.
Yeah.

05:12.279 --> 05:15.215
Wow!
(Chuckle)

05:15.248 --> 05:17.284
Honey, um, want to go out
on the balcony

05:17.317 --> 05:19.387
just to get some fresh air?
Yes.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.554
Wayne:
Okay.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.756
Oh, they're
overwhelmed!
Ha-ha!

05:22.790 --> 05:24.725
What is happening?

05:24.758 --> 05:26.594
They're trying to
take over our wedding,
that's what's happening.

05:26.627 --> 05:29.196
Okay, I mean, uh,
we talked about having
the wedding here

05:29.229 --> 05:30.664
but if you want to
have it in the States

05:30.698 --> 05:32.332
it's fine with me.
No! Not at all.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.967
Our life is here now.
Okay.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.869
Plus, I can't stand
my Auntie Claire.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.638
Mainly I just don't
want them involved, okay?

05:37.671 --> 05:38.739
They've been doing this
my whole life,

05:38.772 --> 05:40.273
trying to take
over everything.

05:40.307 --> 05:41.942
Now they're trying to do it
when I'm 4000 miles away.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.545
Okay, so do you want to
go inside and tell them?

05:44.578 --> 05:46.313
Is there any way
you can do it?

05:46.346 --> 05:47.548
What?

05:47.581 --> 05:49.116
Please, you don't know
what they're like.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.451
Seriously, they just
have this way

05:50.484 --> 05:52.252
of getting what they want.
I can't explain it.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.286
Are you serious now?

05:53.320 --> 05:55.355
Yes! I'm serious!

05:55.389 --> 05:57.057
They made me play
the clarinet
for twelve years,

05:57.090 --> 05:58.191
I hate the clarinet!

05:58.225 --> 06:00.260
Wow, that blows!
(Chuckling)

06:00.293 --> 06:01.762
Get it?
With the clarinet...

06:01.795 --> 06:03.330
I get it, but it's not...
it's not funny right now.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.399
Okay, honey! Relax!

06:05.433 --> 06:06.434
I'll do it.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.001
How hard can it be?

06:08.035 --> 06:08.969
Great.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.039
Emma:
Wayne, Nancy?

06:12.072 --> 06:14.274
We have something
we would like to tell you.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.308
Before you do,

06:15.342 --> 06:17.244
we just want
to tell you

06:17.277 --> 06:19.146
how much this means to us.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.280
Yeah. To be honest,

06:20.313 --> 06:22.249
it kind of feels
like we've lost Brucie

06:22.282 --> 06:25.052
now that he's moved here,
so this helps a lot.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.620
Wayne:
He is our only child.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.522
Nancy:
And this is going to be
our only wedding.

06:28.556 --> 06:29.890
As parents.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.459
And this sort of makes up
for all those Christmases

06:31.492 --> 06:32.626
we spent alone.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.428
Hasn't it been only
one Christmas?

06:34.462 --> 06:36.664
Yes, but that one
was pretty horrible.

06:36.697 --> 06:39.266
Wayne:
So we appreciate
this one little thing

06:39.299 --> 06:41.034
that you're giving us.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.637
A chance to celebrate
your wedding

06:43.671 --> 06:45.873
in the greatest country
in the world.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.608
Nancy:
This is probably
going to be the
greatest gift

06:47.641 --> 06:50.243
that we'll ever get.
Ever.

06:50.277 --> 06:51.645
Anyway,

06:51.679 --> 06:53.213
you wanted to
tell us something?

06:55.282 --> 06:57.184
No.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.151
Bruce?

07:01.555 --> 07:02.556
What just happened?

07:02.590 --> 07:03.791
(Whispering)
I know, I told you!

07:03.824 --> 07:05.125
They're amazing
at getting
what they want!

07:05.158 --> 07:06.927
It's like they play
Jedi mind tricks
or something.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.028
Emma:
I mean, look at this.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.697
Everything is just
so traditional.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.500
I mean, a church?
We're not even religious!

07:12.533 --> 07:14.635
Oh, but churches can be nice.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.504
I mean, sometimes
traditions are nice.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.272
For real? A church wedding
with a priest?

07:19.306 --> 07:21.709
Is that really what
you were thinking?

07:21.742 --> 07:23.243
I mean, I actually
haven't thought
about it...

07:23.276 --> 07:24.645
Babe, this is not us!

07:24.678 --> 07:26.914
I mean, we have
to tell them.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.649
Okay, think of something.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.751
Okay.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.353
We could tell them
your father is sick?

07:33.386 --> 07:35.088
No! That's terrible!

07:35.122 --> 07:38.058
No. That is terrible,
I'm sorry for...

07:39.960 --> 07:41.161
bringing that up.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.730
He does have
his heart problem.
He does.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.798
I mean, so we wouldn't
exactly be lying.

07:44.832 --> 07:47.400
Right, exactly.
It's foolproof.

07:47.434 --> 07:48.468
If you say someone's sick

07:48.502 --> 07:49.503
there's nothing
they can say.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.071
They can't question it.

07:51.104 --> 07:54.875
No, they can't go
"Are you sure?
How sick is he?"

07:54.908 --> 07:56.276
(Whispering)
That's genius, honey.
Thank you.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.178
Boom.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.113
The Empire strikes back.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.615
(Chuckling)

08:01.649 --> 08:04.952
(Imitating whoosh
of lightsaber)

08:07.254 --> 08:08.255
That was a lightsaber.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.222
Yep.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.894
Okay, we need to talk
to you and Mom.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.395
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh...

08:15.428 --> 08:16.597
(Whispering)
Your mother is resting.

08:16.630 --> 08:17.865
What is it, son?

08:17.898 --> 08:19.900
Okay, we should wait
until she gets up.
Oh, no.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.434
Okay, listen.

08:21.468 --> 08:23.370
We have to talk to you
about the wedding.

08:23.403 --> 08:24.638
Before you do,

08:24.672 --> 08:27.675
I didn't want to
have to tell you two this,

08:27.708 --> 08:31.378
but now is as good
a time as any, I guess.

08:31.411 --> 08:33.814
Nancy is very sick.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.348
Are you sure?

08:35.382 --> 08:36.750
How sick is she?

08:36.784 --> 08:38.285
Very sick.

08:38.318 --> 08:39.519
Hmm.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.088
Doctor says it's
only a matter
of months.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.556
There are no guarantees.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.758
She probably
wouldn't have been able

08:44.792 --> 08:46.627
to make it here
to the wedding anyway,

08:46.660 --> 08:48.228
So, thank you.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.763
For making
the right decision.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.765
It's just that it's hard,
that's all.

08:53.466 --> 08:56.870
Sounds hard.
And horrible.

08:56.904 --> 08:59.339
Right, Bruce?

08:59.372 --> 09:01.408
Mom is sick?

09:01.441 --> 09:02.643
I mean, this is awful.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.177
Are you serious right now?

09:04.211 --> 09:06.379
He's obviously lying!
What?

09:06.413 --> 09:08.849
He used the same trick
on us that we were
going to use on them.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.652
You're being played, Bruce.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.121
Oh, they are so good!

09:14.154 --> 09:16.690
How dare they play
with my emotions like that?

09:16.724 --> 09:18.759
I guess my mother's
not even sick!

09:18.792 --> 09:21.394
So if he's lying
I'm actually happy.

09:21.428 --> 09:22.796
But if he's lying
I'm also so mad.

09:22.830 --> 09:25.032
Yeah, I know, it's low.
Yes.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.800
It's outrageous.
Yes!

09:26.834 --> 09:28.135
Pretending to be sick?
I know.

09:28.168 --> 09:31.271
That's disgusting.
It is!

09:31.304 --> 09:33.206
Although technically
we were going to
do the same thing.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.644
Yeah, but we are...

09:36.677 --> 09:37.911
Well, it's
different for us.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.146
Yes.
'Cause...

09:44.852 --> 09:45.853
Well it just is.
It is.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.287
Yes.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.356
I just had the best nap.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.625
Okay, Mom. Can we talk
with you for a second?

09:51.659 --> 09:54.061
Well sure, Brucie,
what is it?

09:54.094 --> 09:55.428
Uh, Dad said that
you were sick.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.364
Oh, that.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.201
Well, yeah, it's true.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.535
Okay, what type
of sickness

10:02.569 --> 10:04.471
are we talking about?

10:04.504 --> 10:05.673
(Doorbell ringing)

10:05.706 --> 10:07.741
Wayne:
I got it, I'll get it.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.342
You know what,
do me a favour Bruce.

10:09.376 --> 10:10.744
I don't want
to think about it.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.479
Just for tonight.
Yeah.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.581
Let's not talk
about it, all right?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.583
(Mixed greetings)

10:18.218 --> 10:21.488
Well, looks like they got
their story straight.

10:21.521 --> 10:24.424
(Sobbing)
Oh my God, your Mom is sick!

10:24.457 --> 10:26.493
She is?

10:26.526 --> 10:28.495
(Mixed chatter)

10:30.731 --> 10:34.868
Okay, anyone want
more potato mousse?

10:34.902 --> 10:36.103
Is there moose in there?

10:36.136 --> 10:37.971
I did not taste the moose
in there, really.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.740
Mashed potatoes.
Mashed.

10:39.773 --> 10:43.043
Oh, well no thank you.
It was delicious, though.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.111
Okay.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.645
Now is the time
when we in Sweden

10:45.679 --> 10:48.415
say thank you to the cock.

10:48.448 --> 10:49.817
What?

10:49.850 --> 10:51.719
It's cook. Cook.

10:51.752 --> 10:52.786
Sorry, it's cook.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.955
Uh, "cock" means
cook in Swedish.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.423
(Chuckling)

10:56.456 --> 10:58.158
Oh, sorry. Cook.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.192
Thank you, Emma.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.260
Thank you, Emma.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.294
Thank you!

11:01.328 --> 11:02.529
Okay, Wayne.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.197
Let's clear the table
and do the dishes.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.198
Yeah, ri...
(Laugh)

11:08.101 --> 11:09.803
You're serious.

11:09.837 --> 11:10.771
Uh... yes.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.307
Nancy:
Here you go, honey.
Thank you.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.076
I want a picture
of that.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.011
Nancy, wine?
Please!

11:18.045 --> 11:19.012
Thank you.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.017
Mm! Mm.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.618
What is in this dip?

11:25.652 --> 11:28.021
Oh, that's Swedish
"gubbröra".

11:28.055 --> 11:29.056
Gubbröra?

11:29.089 --> 11:30.223
It's eggs and anchovies,

11:30.257 --> 11:31.691
if you don't like it
we have other...

11:31.725 --> 11:33.226
Don't like it?
I love it!

11:33.260 --> 11:36.363
I want the recipe.
You're an amazing cook!

11:36.396 --> 11:37.965
Oh, thank you, Nancy.

11:37.998 --> 11:38.932
Oh!

11:51.144 --> 11:54.247
I love listening
to you guys
speak Swedish.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.716
Just sounds amazing.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.685
(Imitating Swedish)

12:00.220 --> 12:01.221
And then you go like,

12:01.254 --> 12:03.156
(Imitating Swedish)

12:04.591 --> 12:06.493
(Continuing)

12:08.195 --> 12:09.797
It's a beautiful language.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.601
You know, Birger,

12:14.634 --> 12:17.204
we have machines in America
that do all this.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.807
(Chuckling)
Yes, but I...
I kind of like it.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.074
Oh, I get that.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.409
A chance for the man
to get away

12:22.442 --> 12:24.211
from the old lady
now and then.

12:24.244 --> 12:28.681
No, I just like
doing dishes.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.450
Yeah.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.319
Hey, what about
your summer house?

12:32.352 --> 12:33.353
Have you sold that yet?

12:33.386 --> 12:34.922
No, not yet.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.289
If I remember right

12:36.323 --> 12:37.757
it was on a beautiful
piece of property.
Yeah.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.259
What are you asking for?

12:39.292 --> 12:42.229
Uh, two million
Swedish.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.797
Two mill...?

12:43.831 --> 12:46.566
That's less than 300 000
American dollars!

12:46.599 --> 12:48.601
That's a steal!
Yeah.

12:48.635 --> 12:49.870
We even had to lower
the price

12:49.903 --> 12:52.339
because no one
was interested.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.874
You know what?

12:53.907 --> 12:56.509
Maybe I'll just
buy that property
from you myself.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.710
Well, that's what
I used to do.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.412
I'd buy a house,
I'd fix it up,

12:59.446 --> 13:01.514
I flip it,
then I can have a profit,

13:01.548 --> 13:02.950
you can have
piece of mind.

13:02.983 --> 13:03.984
Win-win situation.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.986
Yes but you really
don't have to.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.822
I know I don't
have to, Birger.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.257
But I want to.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.993
You know,
as a favour to you!

13:13.026 --> 13:15.795
Eh, you have to see
the house first,

13:15.829 --> 13:17.998
because it's in
a terrible condition.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.766
Well, then we'll see it.

13:19.799 --> 13:20.733
Yes.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.271
I mean, you can't
call yourself a feminist

13:24.304 --> 13:25.472
and be married.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.207
The entire institution
of marriage

13:27.240 --> 13:28.275
is based on oppression

13:28.308 --> 13:30.177
seeing women
as not being equal

13:30.210 --> 13:31.845
to their dominant husbands.

13:31.879 --> 13:34.214
Mmm. I love girl talk.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.283
Don't you?

13:36.316 --> 13:37.750
So, I was thinking.

13:37.784 --> 13:39.987
Do you want to go
shopping for wedding
dresses tomorrow?

13:40.020 --> 13:41.488
Emma:
Oh, I would love to!

13:41.521 --> 13:44.057
Great! You want
to join us, Viveka?

13:44.091 --> 13:46.159
No, it's not my thing.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.360
Okay, great.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.296
Well I guess it's just
the two of us gals then.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.364
Yeah.
(Chuckling)

13:51.398 --> 13:52.399
Nancy:
Oh boy.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.001
You know I have to say...

13:54.034 --> 13:56.970
I'm not looking at this
like I'm losing a son.

13:57.004 --> 14:00.273
I look at this like
I'm gaining a daughter.

14:00.307 --> 14:01.808
The daughter
that I never had.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.078
Emma:
Oh, that's so sweet Nancy.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.346
(Clearing throat)

14:06.379 --> 14:10.517
In fact, if it's okay
I'd like to...

14:10.550 --> 14:11.751
give you something.

14:11.784 --> 14:15.722
This is a bracelet
that I wore on my wedding,

14:15.755 --> 14:18.491
and my Mom wore it
on her wedding,

14:18.525 --> 14:20.393
and I would
very much like it

14:20.427 --> 14:23.330
if you wore it
on your wedding.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.432
Oh my God, it's beautiful.

14:25.465 --> 14:26.633
I'll wear it with pride.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.868
Thank you so much, Nancy.

14:28.902 --> 14:29.769
Thank you.

14:29.802 --> 14:31.604
Oh, I love you so much.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.640
I love you too.
(Shouting)
You know what?

14:33.673 --> 14:36.576
What time are you
going wedding dress
shopping tomorrow?

14:36.609 --> 14:38.278
I think I'll be
able to make it.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.712
I'll squeeze it in.

14:39.746 --> 14:41.949
Okay.
Okay, great.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.918
Great!
You're so cute!

14:44.952 --> 14:46.486
Oh, I love you so much.

14:46.519 --> 14:54.461
(Music)

14:54.494 --> 14:55.996
Uh, I did
a little research

14:56.029 --> 14:57.897
on Swedish
real estate, Birger,

14:57.931 --> 14:59.666
and this is
a real bargain.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.901
It's way below
market value.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.171
I'd be glad to take
this off your hands.

15:04.204 --> 15:08.141
Uh, I must warn you,
we have a lot of
"kackerlackor".

15:08.175 --> 15:09.376
What's that?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.644
Ca... Cacki-lacks?

15:11.678 --> 15:13.880
I'm not sure
what you call them.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.983
Gross, dangerous things

15:16.016 --> 15:17.884
that crawl around
your house.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.619
Yeah. Relatives.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.188
Say, what's with the colour

15:21.221 --> 15:23.690
always being the same
on these buildings?

15:23.723 --> 15:25.858
Is that some kind
of communist red?

15:25.892 --> 15:27.660
No, no, eh...

15:27.694 --> 15:30.397
it's Swedish
traditional colour.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.498
Yeah, well doesn't matter

15:31.531 --> 15:32.732
I'm going to
tear it all down anyway.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.768
Wh... What?

15:35.802 --> 15:38.238
(Gasping)

15:38.271 --> 15:40.473
There it is! There!

15:40.507 --> 15:41.508
It's perfect.

15:41.541 --> 15:42.542
Woman:
My god.
You think?

15:42.575 --> 15:45.545
Nancy:
Yes! You look stunning.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.247
And it's just...
it's breathtaking.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.716
Uh, I don't know,
I'm more...

15:49.749 --> 15:51.251
Bruce? What do you say?

15:51.284 --> 15:53.486
Well, I can't see anything!
Can I take this off now?

15:53.520 --> 15:55.055
No, you can't
take it off,

15:55.088 --> 15:56.623
you're going to have
20 years' bad luck.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.725
Hello! I'm here.
Oh, hey.

15:58.758 --> 15:59.759
Mommy is here.

15:59.792 --> 16:00.760
Oh, thank God.

16:02.562 --> 16:03.763
Viveka:
What did I miss?

16:03.796 --> 16:05.165
Be honest now.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.567
What do you think of this dress?

16:07.600 --> 16:08.601
Wow.

16:08.635 --> 16:09.669
Yeah.

16:09.702 --> 16:12.072
It looks... lovely.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.140
Are you serious now?

16:13.173 --> 16:14.174
Mm-hmm.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.375
So what do you like about it?

16:15.408 --> 16:20.613
It's just white
and beautiful and, um...

16:20.647 --> 16:22.515
white.

16:22.549 --> 16:26.019
Okay, let's see.
What about this?

16:26.053 --> 16:27.887
Is it too much?

16:27.920 --> 16:29.089
You look wonderful,
honey.

16:34.561 --> 16:37.097
They're just going to...
talk it over.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.131
Yeah.

16:38.165 --> 16:41.268
This water
is very dangerous.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.736
Especially
for children.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.605
If you're not looking
for a second

16:45.638 --> 16:48.741
they get drunk
under the water.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.743
Didn't you raise
your children here?

16:51.911 --> 16:53.946
Well, I'll take
my chances.

16:53.980 --> 16:57.450
You know, we tear down
that little red building

16:57.484 --> 17:00.420
and make a nice place
for a garage.

17:00.453 --> 17:01.754
You've got yourself
a deal, Birger,

17:01.788 --> 17:03.556
I'll buy it.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.925
It must make you feel
good to get this off
your mind, huh?

17:05.958 --> 17:07.894
(Chuckling)

17:07.927 --> 17:09.429
You're welcome.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.997
Thank you.

17:11.030 --> 17:17.870
(Music)

17:24.444 --> 17:26.079
Can I help you with anything?

17:26.113 --> 17:27.680
We're fine, thank you.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.579
Woman:
Are you sure everything is okay?

18:06.853 --> 18:08.488
I'm sorry,
I don't understand Swedish,

18:08.521 --> 18:09.722
I just moved here.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.160
So Mom, this sickness.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.727
Tell me more about it.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.564
Do I have to?
It's so embarrassing.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.432
You don't have
to be embarrassed
around me, okay?

18:19.466 --> 18:20.833
Well,

18:20.867 --> 18:24.103
I'm very uncomfortable
talking about that area.

18:24.137 --> 18:25.372
What area?

18:25.405 --> 18:28.475
You know, the...
(Sighing)

18:28.508 --> 18:29.442
the bum.

18:31.978 --> 18:34.013
I have hemorrhoids.

18:34.046 --> 18:36.316
Hemorrhoids?

18:36.349 --> 18:38.185
Hemorrhoids?
Yes!

18:38.218 --> 18:40.086
What a pain in the ass.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.154
Ah!
Get it?

18:41.188 --> 18:42.355
Yeah that was a good one!

18:42.389 --> 18:43.623
No, but seriously.
I mean,

18:43.656 --> 18:45.692
that's great news,
I guess?

18:45.725 --> 18:47.059
Yeah, I mean,
it's a relief.

18:47.093 --> 18:48.595
Yeah. So now
you can tell them

18:48.628 --> 18:50.897
that we want the wedding
to be in Sweden.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.265
Yeah. Can you do it?

18:52.299 --> 18:53.833
Honey, it's your parents!

18:53.866 --> 18:56.603
You have to learn
how to face them.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.671
Stare them down,
deliver the news,

18:58.705 --> 19:01.107
I'll be right behind you.
Okay? You can do this.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.175
Okay. Yes.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.210
You can do this.
Yes.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.777
Yes. Yes!
Yes.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.746
Yes!
Can you do it?

19:06.779 --> 19:07.680
(Sighing)

19:09.782 --> 19:15.622
(Music)

19:15.655 --> 19:17.490
(Clinking glass)

19:17.524 --> 19:20.092
Okay, listen up, everyone.

19:20.126 --> 19:22.195
Bruce has an
announcement to make.

19:22.229 --> 19:23.896
Oh.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.032
Yes. Thank you, honey.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.636
Uh...

19:29.669 --> 19:32.605
Okay, I just, um...

19:32.639 --> 19:33.640
You know, maybe this
isn't the right time.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.542
Maybe it is.
Oh, maybe it is.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.644
Okay, um...

19:37.677 --> 19:41.248
Listen, this is hard
for me, okay?

19:41.281 --> 19:42.849
But sometimes
you just got to put
your foot down...

19:42.882 --> 19:43.883
Before you do...

19:43.916 --> 19:45.285
No, Dad.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.186
None of that
"before you do" crap, okay?

19:47.220 --> 19:48.221
Listen.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.456
Emma and I have been talking.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.057
Okay?

19:51.090 --> 19:52.925
And actually
it was probably more
her idea, but...

19:52.959 --> 19:54.327
No, Bruce.
No... no!

19:54.361 --> 19:56.563
It was both of our ideas.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.665
Okay? A joint decision.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.469
Jointly, we have made
the decision

20:02.502 --> 20:06.273
to have the wedding
in Sweden.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.207
I'm sorry. I know it's
disappointing for you guys,

20:08.241 --> 20:11.478
but our life
is here now, okay?

20:11.511 --> 20:14.281
(Sighing)
And also, we're going to
have it in the church.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.648
I'm sorry, honey,

20:15.682 --> 20:18.117
but it wouldn't
feel like a wedding
to me otherwise.

20:18.150 --> 20:19.819
So that's just the way
it's going to be.

20:19.852 --> 20:22.121
Okay.

20:22.154 --> 20:24.190
Okay.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.459
Okay!

20:26.493 --> 20:27.827
Well, as long
as we're being honest,

20:27.860 --> 20:30.463
um... you two, again,

20:30.497 --> 20:32.332
I'm not a big fan
of Auntie Claire.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.501
Oh, that's okay,
she hates you.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.503
(Chuckling)

20:36.536 --> 20:40.006
(Pounding table)
I also have to be honest!

20:40.039 --> 20:42.442
I love our summer house!
(Pounding table)

20:42.475 --> 20:46.446
I don't want to sell it
to Wayne or to anyone!

20:46.479 --> 20:47.414
Thank you.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.984
Nancy:
Well, if we're going
to be completely honest,

20:52.018 --> 20:54.421
I have to say that
that "gubbröra"

20:54.454 --> 20:55.822
it's... tasted disgusting.

20:55.855 --> 20:58.057
It was like a fish
took a crap

20:58.090 --> 20:59.792
right in my mouth!

20:59.826 --> 21:01.060
I knew it!

21:01.093 --> 21:02.562
Well, okay, now
that we're being honest,

21:02.595 --> 21:03.963
I have a few things
I'd like to say

21:03.996 --> 21:05.365
and I want to start
with you, Nancy...

21:05.398 --> 21:06.699
Okay, thank you.

21:06.733 --> 21:09.536
I think that's enough
honesty for one night.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.438
Thank you.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.505
Can I make a toast?

21:12.539 --> 21:14.206
Nancy:
Yes, cheers.

21:17.377 --> 21:18.978
I'm going to get
some breakfast.

21:21.348 --> 21:23.082
Good moron!

21:23.115 --> 21:25.184
I would like breakfast.

21:25.217 --> 21:28.988
Jaa, I want
a cup of caffet,

21:29.021 --> 21:32.625
and, uh, egg-uh
and bread-uh...

21:32.659 --> 21:34.026
(Sighing)

21:34.060 --> 21:36.128
What? Viveka
is teaching me Swedish.

21:36.162 --> 21:37.964
That's not S...
And, um,

21:37.997 --> 21:42.168
(clearing throat)
some hemorrhoid-uh crème-uh.

21:42.201 --> 21:43.770
Jaa, jaa.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.304
Quickly.

21:45.338 --> 21:48.107
(Speaking in Swedish)
(Chuckling)

21:48.140 --> 21:49.141
Honey?

21:49.175 --> 21:51.411
Yes?

21:51.444 --> 21:53.613
What is that?
No, no, no,
you have to...

21:53.646 --> 21:55.915
No, I'm not going
to put bread in
the suitcase!

21:55.948 --> 21:57.149
I don't care,

21:57.183 --> 21:58.851
Wayne, I have to
have that bread.

21:58.885 --> 22:01.654
That is the greatest bread
I've ever had in my life.

22:01.688 --> 22:02.589
Taste it.

22:03.756 --> 22:04.657
(Sniffing)

22:06.158 --> 22:07.894
What do you think?
It's good right?

22:07.927 --> 22:09.629
Oh!
That's good!

22:09.662 --> 22:11.731
That's bread! Okay.

22:11.764 --> 22:14.000
I'll have a little nibble
just before we...

22:14.033 --> 22:15.067
You know what?

22:15.101 --> 22:16.569
We'll stop by
the breakfast place

22:16.603 --> 22:18.505
on the way downstairs.

22:18.538 --> 22:21.474
* We're not living in America
