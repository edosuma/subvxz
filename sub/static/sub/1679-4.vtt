00:00.382 --> 00:03.929
Kids, sometimes your relationship 
goes so smoothly for so long

00:03.939 --> 00:06.143
that you think it will be 
that way forever.

00:06.153 --> 00:07.421
It never is.

00:07.431 --> 00:09.739
Well, we just had our first fight.

00:09.749 --> 00:11.186
We had our first fight.

00:11.196 --> 00:12.911
Oh, no, what'd you fight about?

00:12.991 --> 00:15.861
Oh, no, what'd you fight about?

00:18.950 --> 00:21.340
A few months ago, 
my architecture firm was approached

00:21.350 --> 00:22.567
to design this new building...

00:22.578 --> 00:24.823
It's this big skyscraper 
in Spokane.

00:24.833 --> 00:26.591
It'd be a huge project 
for his firm.

00:26.607 --> 00:28.693
And if we don't get it, 
we could go under.

00:28.709 --> 00:31.732
So anyway, the head architect 
unveils his new design

00:31.748 --> 00:33.163
to the whole company.

00:39.088 --> 00:40.080
- No.
- No.

00:40.097 --> 00:41.213
Yes.

00:41.226 --> 00:44.260
All skyscrapers 
kind of look like a...

00:44.275 --> 00:47.963
Marshall, 
it's a 78-story pink marble tower

00:47.975 --> 00:49.540
with a rounded top

00:49.557 --> 00:52.451
and two spherical 
entryways at the front.

00:52.465 --> 00:54.360
Wow, so it's the whole package.

00:54.377 --> 00:56.422
- Yeah, you did.
- Had to.

00:56.547 --> 00:59.113
Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, 
you got to get me in.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.451
And don't give me the shaft.

01:00.467 --> 01:02.301
- Yeah, you did.
- Had to.

01:03.067 --> 01:04.602
It's a travesty.

01:04.617 --> 01:06.562
It's gonna define 
the skyline of the city.

01:06.575 --> 01:09.103
If it was me, I could've 
designed something amazing.

01:09.117 --> 01:12.112
Instead, I'm spending 12 hours 
a day designing the cornices.

01:12.127 --> 01:14.872
- Yeah, you did.
- That wasn't one.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074

01:27.755 --> 01:30.073
So you and Ted 
had your first fight.

01:30.096 --> 01:32.752
It obviously ended well. 
I mean, you're here with me.

01:32.768 --> 01:34.573
Actually, 
it didn't end at all.

01:34.587 --> 01:36.671
I started getting bummed out, 
so I came here.

01:36.686 --> 01:37.672
It's what I do.

01:37.687 --> 01:39.513
When my grandma died, 
I got a perm.

01:39.528 --> 01:42.551
Ooh, two tragedies in one day.

01:43.558 --> 01:45.892
The thing is, 
Ted has been literally

01:45.908 --> 01:48.323
complaining about work 
nonstop for weeks.

01:48.335 --> 01:51.833
So, when I came over today, 
I was kind of done.

01:51.898 --> 01:53.192
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:53.206 --> 01:55.190
- How was your day?
- Good.

01:57.217 --> 01:59.032
Wow, you're a great interviewer.

01:59.047 --> 02:00.280
Aren't you gonna ask 
how my day was?

02:00.298 --> 02:02.923
No, I know how it was. 
It was awful.

02:02.938 --> 02:05.233
Ooh, you want to rent 
a movie tonight?

02:05.356 --> 02:06.872
You know, um...

02:06.887 --> 02:09.233
I listen to your work 
stories all the time.

02:09.247 --> 02:11.832
Yeah, but... 
and I don't want to be rude here,

02:11.847 --> 02:14.442
but my work stories 
are interesting.

02:14.456 --> 02:16.511
I'm a television news reporter.

02:16.738 --> 02:18.592
- Robin...
- What?

02:18.607 --> 02:20.353
I knew exactly
 what he was going to say.

02:20.367 --> 02:23.060
I was just helping him 
get there faster.

02:23.076 --> 02:26.020
You should work 
at a suicide hotline.

02:26.555 --> 02:28.172
And then it got ugly.

02:28.187 --> 02:31.852
What I don't do is tell you 
the same story over and over again.

02:31.868 --> 02:33.753
I mean, you wouldn't 
watch the same movie

02:33.767 --> 02:35.590
over and over again, would you?

02:35.607 --> 02:38.622
Maybe a great movie 
like Die Hard.

02:38.637 --> 02:40.280
But Field of Dreams?

02:40.297 --> 02:42.493
Once is more than enough.

02:45.568 --> 02:47.592
So that's your go-to bad movie?

02:47.606 --> 02:49.590
The number one example 
on the tip of your tongue

02:49.605 --> 02:52.372
of a bad movie is 
Field of Dreams?

02:52.386 --> 02:54.711
It's about 
ghost baseball players.

02:54.726 --> 02:56.322
I think it's stupid.

03:00.077 --> 03:03.611
So, now he's all mad at me 
about the stupid movie.

03:03.626 --> 03:06.382
Robin, he's upset because 
you wouldn't listen to him,

03:06.397 --> 03:08.532
not because you didn't like 
some movie.

03:08.547 --> 03:11.740
How do you not like 
Field of Dreams?!

03:12.886 --> 03:16.462
Listening is the foundation 
of a relationship.

03:16.477 --> 03:18.093
And if he's really droning on,

03:18.105 --> 03:20.592
you can always practice 
saying the alphabet backwards.

03:20.605 --> 03:23.061
You know, in case 
you get pulled over for a DUI.

03:23.075 --> 03:24.551
I guess I don't know 
how to do that.

03:24.566 --> 03:26.990
Yeah, it's really hard, 
even when you're sober.

03:27.008 --> 03:28.961
That's what I tried 
to explain to the cop.

03:28.977 --> 03:32.751
No,  I mean, I guess I don't know 
how to do this girlfriend thing.

03:32.768 --> 03:36.132
I've never been in a relationship 
this serious before.

03:37.088 --> 03:40.190
I should probably go tell him 
I'm sorry, shouldn't I?

03:41.567 --> 03:43.793
You're trying to do it right now, 
aren't you?

03:43.805 --> 03:46.372
What the hell comes before "Q"?

03:47.157 --> 03:50.873
Then at the end of the movie when 
he has a catch with his dad, like...

03:50.887 --> 03:54.472
like he never did when he was 
young enough for it to matter.

03:55.256 --> 03:57.772
Can we talk about something else?

03:58.355 --> 03:59.583
You know what, dude?

03:59.595 --> 04:01.901
Forget about Robin, okay? 
You're hanging with us tonight.

04:01.918 --> 04:03.783
I've got an awome party lined up.

04:03.796 --> 04:05.182
Oh, God.

04:05.198 --> 04:08.850
This gonna be another one 
of your weird all-guy parties?

04:08.868 --> 04:12.012
That was a poker game. 
What is wrong with you?

04:12.338 --> 04:14.540
No, it's the first law school 
party of the year

04:14.558 --> 04:16.089
and it's gonna be awesome.

04:16.105 --> 04:18.002
I haven't seen this guys since, 
like, last year

04:18.017 --> 04:19.570
before Lily and I broke up.

04:19.584 --> 04:21.873
So I'm gonna have 
to break the news to everybody.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.843
It's really gonna bum them out.

04:24.488 --> 04:26.403
This party's gonna suck.

04:27.057 --> 04:29.842
Well, love to join you at that one.

04:30.156 --> 04:32.692
But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.

04:32.748 --> 04:34.510
I wish I could join you guys, 
but I got to get back

04:34.527 --> 04:36.581
to my apparently boring job.

04:36.597 --> 04:39.123
- Your job's not boring.
- Robin thinks so.

04:39.135 --> 04:41.462
Dude, lots of chicks 
think architects are hot.

04:41.476 --> 04:44.023
Think about it, 
you create something out of nothing.

04:44.036 --> 04:45.173
You're like God.

04:45.186 --> 04:47.212
There's nobody hotter than God.

04:47.225 --> 04:49.170
I love it when you quote Scripture.

04:49.185 --> 04:53.280
I'm telling you, you should use 
the architect angle with the ladies.

04:53.295 --> 04:55.541
Okay, first of all, 
I have a girlfriend.

04:55.556 --> 04:58.010
Second, the architect angle 
doesn't even work on her.

04:58.028 --> 05:00.943
And, third, I can't imagine 
that working on anyone ever.

05:00.958 --> 05:03.303
That's 'cause you're always like...

05:03.316 --> 05:06.621
Ted Mosby, architect.

05:06.868 --> 05:08.832
If it were me, I'd be like...

05:08.845 --> 05:11.452
Ted Mosby, architect.

05:13.095 --> 05:16.680
Anything sounds impressive when 
it's said with the right attitude.

05:17.216 --> 05:18.801
Marshall Ericksen.

05:18.816 --> 05:21.501
Recently dumped 
and heading to a lame party.

05:21.515 --> 05:24.150
Whoa. Whoa, ladies, 
please take it easy.

05:24.165 --> 05:25.381
There's enough of me for everyone.

05:25.397 --> 05:27.822
Oh. Hi. Hello.

05:27.836 --> 05:29.873
All right. We're gonna take off..

05:29.888 --> 05:31.832
Wait up, I'll leave with you guys.

05:32.848 --> 05:35.350
Ted Mosby, architect.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.010
Trust  me.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.413
Hey, just out of curiosity.

05:49.427 --> 05:51.141
If a guy told you 
he was an architect,

05:51.157 --> 05:52.573
what would you think of that?

05:52.586 --> 05:53.731
Are  you kidding?

05:53.745 --> 05:55.962
Architects are hot.

05:55.976 --> 05:59.340
How do you think Mr. Brady 
scored a babe like Carol?

05:59.357 --> 06:00.991
Solid point.

06:01.005 --> 06:02.953
She did have hair of gold.

06:02.967 --> 06:04.921
- Yes, she did.
- Mm-hmm.

06:08.828 --> 06:10.560
Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?

06:10.578 --> 06:11.580
No.

06:11.595 --> 06:13.443
Hey, Lily.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.783
- You still single?
- Yes.

06:15.897 --> 06:19.411
You know... I've poured a lot of 
free drinks for you over the years.

06:19.428 --> 06:20.823
A lot.

06:20.836 --> 06:23.220
Carl, do you really want 
to be with a woman

06:23.233 --> 06:25.461
who would trade sex for beer?

06:25.477 --> 06:27.413
Only if you're into it.

06:28.489 --> 06:29.722
It's on me.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.263
Thanks.

06:31.277 --> 06:32.892
I wonder where Ted went.

06:32.908 --> 06:35.470
Ted Mosby, the architect?

06:36.316 --> 06:37.610
Actually, yeah.

06:37.628 --> 06:39.792
Oh, he is such a cool guy.

06:39.807 --> 06:41.312
He was here earlier.

06:41.327 --> 06:44.690
And what made you decide 
you wanted to become an architect?

06:44.707 --> 06:47.310
Well, you know, soul of an artist,

06:47.325 --> 06:49.632
hands of a master craftsman.

06:49.646 --> 06:51.913
It was inevitable, I guess.

06:51.928 --> 06:54.370
I bet you can draw, can't you?

06:55.266 --> 06:56.862
You should draw me.

06:56.878 --> 07:01.123
Well, I could try, but you might end up 
looking like a midcentury tri-level.

07:02.675 --> 07:06.070
Hey. If you want, my friend Marshall 
invited me to this party we could all go to.

07:06.088 --> 07:07.870
Marshall's great. 
He's just a lawyer,

07:07.885 --> 07:11.161
but somebody has to push the paper 
around for us creative types.

07:11.176 --> 07:12.643
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

07:14.417 --> 07:17.570
He asked her to a party. 
Oh, my God, are you okay?

07:17.587 --> 07:19.970
Okay? It's awesome. 
It's a win-win.

07:19.986 --> 07:22.121
Ted got to vent 
and I don't have to hear it.

07:22.138 --> 07:24.321
Maybe after he's done with 
the talkie-talk, he'll come over

07:24.337 --> 07:25.841
and I'll get the fun part.

07:25.855 --> 07:27.623
What is wrong with you?

07:27.637 --> 07:32.111
God, I feel like I'm teaching 
love as a second language here.

07:32.128 --> 07:35.002
Okay, you know how when 
he tells you boring work stories

07:35.016 --> 07:36.450
you're supposed to listen?

07:36.467 --> 07:39.423
Well, when he picks up 
some random girl at a bar,

07:39.448 --> 07:41.080
you're supposed to freak out.

07:41.098 --> 07:44.472
I'm not freaking out 
because in my mind, she's fat.

07:44.485 --> 07:47.263
She's a kickboxing instructor.

07:47.276 --> 07:50.503
Her ass looks better than my face.

07:51.088 --> 07:53.323
All right, we'll swing by the party.

07:55.265 --> 07:57.753
Now the party was for 
some of Marshall's classmates

07:57.766 --> 07:59.550
from Columbia Law School,

07:59.567 --> 08:01.261
who by day were some of the sharpest

08:01.277 --> 08:04.233
and most serious 
young legal minds in the country.

08:04.248 --> 08:06.180
By night, however...

08:08.425 --> 08:11.043
Damn, these are some 
drunk almost-lawyers.

08:11.057 --> 08:12.781
Okay! Seriously...

08:12.795 --> 08:15.691
who wants to shave my ass?!

08:15.708 --> 08:18.982
That guy went on to become 
a Supreme Court justice.

08:20.186 --> 08:22.543
Okay, where are 
the guys and the hooker?

08:22.557 --> 08:26.292
Yo, what's up, ladies? 
Welcome to the party. Yeah!

08:26.305 --> 08:28.303
Just need you to sign 
this release protecting the host

08:28.315 --> 08:30.091
from any and all responsibility 
should you harm yourself

08:30.106 --> 08:31.212
or a third party.

08:31.228 --> 08:33.941
Then freakin' rage! Yeah!

08:33.956 --> 08:36.961
Hey, drunk legal dude, um... 
have you seen Marshall Ericksen?

08:36.976 --> 08:38.511
He was with a guy named Ted.

08:38.525 --> 08:40.610
You mean Ted Mosby, the architect?

08:40.628 --> 08:42.261
Man, what a visionary.

08:42.277 --> 08:44.373
Yeah, they were here.

08:45.357 --> 08:48.353
Awards are nice, 
they look good on my shelf.

08:48.368 --> 08:50.882
But none of that acclaim means 
anything compared to the joy

08:50.897 --> 08:54.102
of seeing the sun rise over 
your first building.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.421
Wow.

08:55.437 --> 08:58.322
I would love to watch 
the sun rise with you.

08:58.335 --> 09:00.303
I know you would.

09:00.515 --> 09:02.500
It's the job.

09:02.825 --> 09:06.290
Dude. You should let us 
shave your ass tonight.

09:06.307 --> 09:08.143
No way.

09:08.745 --> 09:11.511
Hey,  Marshall, where's Lily?

09:12.425 --> 09:16.482
I didn't want to ruin the party 
for everybody this early, but, uh...

09:16.605 --> 09:18.793
everyone take a seat.

09:22.045 --> 09:25.371
Um... Lily actually called off 
the wedding this summer

09:25.388 --> 09:27.371
to go to San Francisco.

09:27.386 --> 09:28.901
So...

09:28.918 --> 09:30.942
we're broken up.

09:32.278 --> 09:34.542
Her name wasn't on 
your lease, was it?

09:34.556 --> 09:36.882
'Cause if not, New York state law, 
you're not obligated

09:36.896 --> 09:39.372
to give her half the deposit 
when you move.

09:39.895 --> 09:42.303
Yeah, that's not really the part 
I was worried about, guys.

09:42.316 --> 09:45.913
And don't forget the precedent set 
by Smith v. Rosenblatt, '74.

09:45.926 --> 09:48.132
Any personal effects she left 
in your house or dwelling

09:48.148 --> 09:51.012
become yours after 30 days.

09:51.606 --> 09:55.803
Guys, can we cease and desist 
with the lawyer speak for a minute?

09:55.818 --> 09:57.430
Love died.

09:57.446 --> 10:01.191
The love that made you all believe 
in love, that's dead now.

10:03.975 --> 10:05.372
You should sue her.

10:05.386 --> 10:07.053
Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?

10:07.068 --> 10:10.231
On the grounds of... shut up.

10:12.416 --> 10:14.613
That's our attorney general.

10:16.555 --> 10:19.482
See? Marshall's still hung up 
on our breakup.

10:19.497 --> 10:21.713
Why? Because I listened to him.

10:21.728 --> 10:24.402
It was a strong 
and nurturing relationship

10:24.416 --> 10:27.551
that I threw away like old gum.

10:27.687 --> 10:30.893
Not that I'm worried or anything, 
but, um, back to the sun rising

10:30.906 --> 10:34.431
over Ted and, uh... oh, 
what tasteful way did you describe her?

10:34.445 --> 10:36.302
The girl with the smackable ass.

10:36.318 --> 10:38.773
Yes, that's the young lady.

10:39.367 --> 10:43.510
So, I know the bouncer 
at this techno club, Posers.

10:43.528 --> 10:45.290
Do you feel like dancing?

10:45.305 --> 10:48.152
Yeah, okay. 
There is no way Ted went dancing.

10:48.166 --> 10:49.593
Ted hates clubs.

10:49.605 --> 10:52.063
Hell, yeah. I love clubs.

10:52.076 --> 10:54.341
I mean, I was going to design 
a cathedral tonight,

10:54.357 --> 10:57.333
kind of take a whack at the whole 
relationship between God and man conundrum.

10:57.345 --> 10:59.090
But sure, let's go dancing.

10:59.108 --> 11:00.312
Wait, let me just check 
with my friend.

11:00.328 --> 11:01.130
Okay.

11:01.146 --> 11:03.991
Hey, Marshall. You up for 
some super loud, repetitive music

11:04.006 --> 11:05.963
that hasn't changed 
since the mid-90s?

11:05.978 --> 11:08.613
Um... only always.

11:09.216 --> 11:10.542
Let's go.

11:11.056 --> 11:14.280
Dancing? 
He went dancing with this girl?

11:14.425 --> 11:16.460
Okay, maybe this is a little bad.

11:16.477 --> 11:19.133
Dancing is bad. 
Dancing leads to sex.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.423
Did you grow up 
in that Footloose town?

11:21.438 --> 11:23.850
I'm calling him. 
I'm telling him that I was wrong

11:23.866 --> 11:27.282
and I'm sorry, and I totally want to 
listen to his stupid stories.

11:27.298 --> 11:31.312
Yeah, think of another way 
to phrase that and you'll be fine.

11:32.435 --> 11:34.222
He's not answering.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.231
Calling Marshall.

11:38.657 --> 11:39.551
Hello.

11:39.567 --> 11:42.283
Marshall, hi, it's Robin. 
Can I talk to Ted?

11:42.295 --> 11:44.070
Oh, Robin, hi.

11:44.088 --> 11:48.050
Um, no, Ted's not here tonight. 
He's, uh... he's working.

11:48.065 --> 11:51.753
Uh, okay. Bye.

11:53.248 --> 11:55.202
Marshall just lied.

11:55.598 --> 11:57.750
Ted's cheating on me.

12:01.347 --> 12:04.472
Excuse me. I'm looking for 
a couple guys who came in here earlier.

12:04.487 --> 12:07.221
One's about six-four, 210, 
sandy brown hair.

12:07.238 --> 12:09.572
And the other's a cheating bastard.

12:09.587 --> 12:11.493
You're going to need 
to refresh my memory.

12:11.508 --> 12:15.913
Okay, fella, baby knows 
how this game's played.

12:16.315 --> 12:18.550
How's a $20 help your memory?

12:18.567 --> 12:21.342
Thanks,  but seriously, 
it was crazy tonight.

12:21.358 --> 12:24.013
You really do need 
to refresh my memory.

12:24.026 --> 12:25.772
Then can I have the...?

12:25.788 --> 12:27.510
That's cool. You keep that.

12:27.527 --> 12:29.951
So these guys-- 
one of them's an architect.

12:29.968 --> 12:31.411
Ted Mosby, the architect?

12:31.426 --> 12:32.503
That's the one.

12:32.516 --> 12:34.762
Oh, yeah, he was here.

12:35.527 --> 12:38.691
And then I was all, "No, Frank Gehry. 
You're on your own this time."

12:38.708 --> 12:42.571
And that, my dear, 
was the end of that hack's career.

12:42.817 --> 12:45.110
I live across the street.

12:45.128 --> 12:47.323
That is one hell of a non sequitur.

12:47.338 --> 12:48.732
You want to come over?

12:48.746 --> 12:51.030
Well, I don't know.

12:51.068 --> 12:53.530
But I suppose I should at least 
give you a ride home.

12:53.545 --> 12:55.023
Hop on.

12:55.265 --> 12:56.913
I'll see you at book club, Vinny.

12:56.927 --> 12:59.550
- Yeah. I'll be bringing the crudités.
- Nice.

13:01.058 --> 13:02.950
Dude, dude, what are you doing?

13:02.965 --> 13:04.431
Galloping.

13:04.455 --> 13:08.222
You proved it, all right? The whole 
Ted Mosby, architect things works.

13:08.237 --> 13:10.440
Architects rule! Whoo-hee!

13:10.455 --> 13:12.340
Aren't you a little worried 
that a certain somebody

13:12.357 --> 13:14.331
might find out that 
you're doing this?

13:14.346 --> 13:15.672
This isn't you, Ted.

13:15.685 --> 13:17.550
It is tonight.

13:17.708 --> 13:19.322
Whoo!

13:21.855 --> 13:24.040
You know this girl. 
Where does she live?

13:24.057 --> 13:26.750
I'm not telling you that 
for less than 20 bucks.

13:26.768 --> 13:29.061
- Well, I'm out of money.
- I'm cashed, too.

13:29.077 --> 13:30.550
I'll take your purse.

13:30.565 --> 13:31.463
My purse?

13:31.477 --> 13:33.721
Yeah, my girl likes clutches.

13:34.985 --> 13:36.872
Okay, fine.

13:37.278 --> 13:41.162
You should tell her that looks 
really good with a chocolate boot.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.283
Bitch is lucky I brought 
my small purse.

13:44.297 --> 13:46.642
No room for my gun. Here.

13:46.656 --> 13:48.953
Now where does the rodeo slut live?

13:48.966 --> 13:52.442
The building with the green light, 
apartment 3-C.

13:52.508 --> 13:53.990
Oh, my God, Robin,

13:54.005 --> 13:56.672
are you going to kick 
this girl's ass?

13:56.687 --> 13:58.070
Yeah...

13:58.088 --> 14:00.321
and steal her purse.

14:03.257 --> 14:05.123
I can't believe 
he's cheating on me.

14:05.137 --> 14:06.452
You know how many times 
I could have cheated?

14:06.466 --> 14:08.010
Six... no seven.

14:08.027 --> 14:10.591
And you know two of them, 
and they would surprise you.

14:10.977 --> 14:13.031
3-C, let's do this. You ready?

14:13.046 --> 14:14.572
Should I just kick the door in?

14:14.587 --> 14:16.762
Those are really nice heels 
and you already lost the purse.

14:16.775 --> 14:18.691
Let's see if it's unlocked.

14:19.578 --> 14:21.442
It's unlocked.

14:21.457 --> 14:25.433
Okay, get in there 
and kick some spankable ass.

14:27.427 --> 14:29.202
Robin.

14:29.628 --> 14:32.021
- I'm the problem.
- What?

14:32.037 --> 14:33.360
You were right.

14:33.378 --> 14:34.753
I don't know how to be a girlfriend.

14:34.765 --> 14:36.530
I took the nicest guy in the world

14:36.547 --> 14:38.310
and I made him a cheater.

14:38.326 --> 14:40.923
Well, don't stand out here 
and beat yourself up.

14:40.937 --> 14:42.671
Get in there and beat Ted up.

14:42.686 --> 14:45.012
I'll handle the slutty kickboxer.

14:45.027 --> 14:47.211
Actually, I'll take Ted.

14:47.486 --> 14:50.202
- Let's do this.
- Bring it.

15:10.865 --> 15:12.553
What do you think you're...?

15:13.298 --> 15:14.490
Barney?

15:14.505 --> 15:17.491
Thank God you're here. 
Can you help with this? I need nails.

15:18.755 --> 15:21.451
Okay, I'm totally lost here. 
Where's Ted?

15:21.465 --> 15:23.330
Ted? He's at work.

15:23.345 --> 15:25.230
How did you get here?

15:25.558 --> 15:28.503
Awesome story. As per usual.

15:28.798 --> 15:31.542
How do you think Mr. Brady 
scored a babe like Carol?

15:31.558 --> 15:32.892
Solid point.

15:32.906 --> 15:35.812
- And she did have hair of gold.
- Yes, she did.

15:35.828 --> 15:37.923
Sorry, I forgot my binocs 
for Foxy Boxing.

15:37.938 --> 15:41.171
Whoo, looks like things just got 
a little foxier right here.

15:41.188 --> 15:42.843
Yes, they did. 
And you're just in time.

15:42.858 --> 15:46.843
Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you 
in very good, if slightly sullied hands.

15:46.856 --> 15:49.842
Don't go. We don't even know your name 
to look out for your buildings.

15:49.856 --> 15:51.920
Yeah, stay.

15:53.096 --> 15:54.902
Excuse us for one second.

15:55.686 --> 15:58.911
Okay, you were right-- 
the architect thing totally works.

15:58.928 --> 16:01.681
But I've got a girlfriend 
and I've got to get back to work.

16:01.698 --> 16:04.340
This project is getting 
harder and harder.

16:04.357 --> 16:06.472
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah, had to.

16:06.486 --> 16:07.730
See ya.

16:09.006 --> 16:12.381
Sorry, my, uh... 
intern had to leave.

16:12.395 --> 16:14.271
Oh, well, that's too bad.

16:14.286 --> 16:16.372
I'm Anna, by the way.

16:17.926 --> 16:21.290
Ted Mosby... architect.

16:22.347 --> 16:25.482
But none of that acclaim means 
anything compared to the joy

16:25.496 --> 16:29.040
of seeing the sun rise 
over your first building.

16:30.797 --> 16:33.821
- Dude, dude, what are you doing?
- Galloping.

16:34.108 --> 16:38.301
All right, you proved it. The whole 
Ted Mosby, architect thing works.

16:38.315 --> 16:40.533
Architects rule! Whoo-hoo.

16:40.547 --> 16:43.683
Aren't you afraid a certain somebody 
might find out about this?

16:43.695 --> 16:45.733
I mean, this isn't you, Ted.

16:45.746 --> 16:47.771
It is tonight.

16:48.618 --> 16:50.671
And that led to a couple of hours

16:50.688 --> 16:54.642
that I cannot, as a gentleman, 
divulge to you.

16:54.658 --> 16:57.593
We did it right here, 
and here and here.

16:58.838 --> 17:01.693
But why would you use 
Ted's name?

17:01.705 --> 17:04.060
I've had some recent bad press 
on the World Wide Web.

17:04.076 --> 17:07.962
So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole 
"using my real name" thing.

17:08.867 --> 17:12.353
Oh, this is great. 
It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay.

17:12.367 --> 17:14.323
Everything isn't okay.

17:14.336 --> 17:18.692
Look at me. I'm acting crazy 
and jealous and paranoid.

17:18.707 --> 17:21.482
This is how people act 
in relationships.

17:21.497 --> 17:24.362
And that's why 
I avoid relationships.

17:24.948 --> 17:26.213
Well, guess what,

17:26.227 --> 17:29.431
I haven't been crazy or jealous 
or paranoid in months,

17:29.447 --> 17:32.731
and I really miss it.

17:33.085 --> 17:35.710
And thus ended this chapter of, 
"Let's pour our hearts out

17:35.726 --> 17:38.030
in the bedroom of Barney's 
one-night stand."

17:38.045 --> 17:40.010
Come on, let's go before 
she gets out of the shower.

17:40.027 --> 17:42.540
You're such a pig. 
You're not even going to say good-bye?

17:42.558 --> 17:46.251
I'll have you know 
I composed a lovely form letter

17:46.268 --> 17:48.682
for use in just such an occasion.

17:49.148 --> 17:51.840
Just fill out her name and then...

17:53.106 --> 17:54.763
Something  with a "A."

17:54.778 --> 17:57.432
A... A...

17:57.827 --> 18:00.400
I'll just put "resident."

18:02.335 --> 18:04.693
Go, go, go, go.

18:10.618 --> 18:12.780
Robin took a long walk that night.

18:12.796 --> 18:15.481
She thought about how opening 
yourself up to another person

18:15.498 --> 18:18.843
usually means opening yourself up 
to going a little crazy.

18:18.856 --> 18:22.653
She thought about how much easier 
it was just to be alone.

18:23.298 --> 18:25.521
And then she came to see me.

18:25.535 --> 18:29.991
# And I am nothing of a builder #

18:30.277 --> 18:34.953
# But here I dreamt I was an architect... #
Hey.

18:35.376 --> 18:36.723
Hey.

18:36.978 --> 18:39.692
- What are you doing here?
- I brought donuts.

18:39.706 --> 18:42.480
And I don't want to brag, 
but they're filled with jelly.

18:43.098 --> 18:44.452
Thanks.

18:46.895 --> 18:49.773
So, uh... how was your night?

18:49.788 --> 18:53.032
It was... fine. Nothing exciting.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.462
How was yours?

18:56.458 --> 18:59.291
You really want to hear about 
boring architect stuff?

18:59.307 --> 19:01.303
Yes, I do.

19:01.615 --> 19:04.093
I'm sorry about earlier.

19:04.547 --> 19:07.232
To tell you the truth, I never 
even saw all of Field of Dreams.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.662
I fell asleep half way through.

19:09.675 --> 19:11.873
What? The best part's 
the last 20 minutes.

19:11.887 --> 19:14.550
Well, maybe they should have moved that 
part up a little bit earlier, 'cause...

19:14.567 --> 19:16.620
You know what, um...

19:16.635 --> 19:19.583
What I'm trying to say is...

19:19.717 --> 19:22.922
I love being the person 
you bitch to.

19:23.908 --> 19:28.030
So how was your day, 
Mr. Architect?

19:28.047 --> 19:30.501
Oh, I like the way 
you say that.

19:31.298 --> 19:33.332
Hey, you want to see 
the building

19:33.345 --> 19:35.560
that will make every man 
in Spokane feel inadequate?

19:35.578 --> 19:37.260
Obviously.

19:38.316 --> 19:39.961
- Wow.
- Yeah.

19:39.975 --> 19:42.253
You know, you didn't mention 
all the foliage around the base.

19:42.265 --> 19:44.141
If you trim that back, 
the rest would look bigger.

19:44.156 --> 19:46.370
You don't have to tell me.

19:47.856 --> 19:51.632
And, um... just for fun, I've...

19:51.648 --> 19:55.511
I've sort of been working on my own idea 
of what I think the building should be.

19:59.928 --> 20:01.801
What do you think?

20:02.465 --> 20:06.590
You know that time we went to Spokane 
and I pointed out that skyscraper?

20:06.605 --> 20:09.381
That was the first building 
I ever designed.

20:09.398 --> 20:13.901
And that night was the first time 
I showed anyone my first drawing of it.

20:14.295 --> 20:15.920
Wow.

20:16.385 --> 20:18.851
Ted, this is amazing.

20:18.865 --> 20:20.781
Thanks.

20:22.175 --> 20:24.730
It's not like it will ever 
come to anything.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.501
I don't know.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.962
It might come to something.

20:29.176 --> 20:34.133
You know, girls find 
architects very hot.

20:37.786 --> 20:39.752
Okay,

20:39.765 --> 20:44.162
but I don't want you expecting 
78 stories or anything.

20:50.527 --> 20:52.641
"Dear Resident...

20:52.657 --> 20:55.571
The time we spent together, 
however long it was,

20:55.585 --> 20:57.443
meant the world to me.

20:57.455 --> 21:00.372
I would love to see you again, 
but unfortunately, I cannot.

21:00.387 --> 21:03.861
You see, I am a ghost.

21:03.878 --> 21:06.780
I can't only materialize

on the anniversary of my death.

21:09.316 --> 21:12.452

the living with you,

21:12.467 --> 21:14.512

21:14.526 --> 21:17.430

21:19.766 --> 21:23.293

from the beyond.
