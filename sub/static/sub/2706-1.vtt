01:19.871 --> 01:24.460
Who is the man that would risk
his neck for his brother man

01:24.502 --> 01:26.380
Shaft

01:26.463 --> 01:28.383
Can ya dig it

01:35.725 --> 01:37.687
Who's the cat
that won't cop out

01:37.728 --> 01:40.649
When there's danger all about

01:40.691 --> 01:42.193
Shaft

01:42.235 --> 01:43.987
Right on

01:44.070 --> 01:46.532
They say this cat Shaft
is a bad mother...

01:46.615 --> 01:48.326
Shut your mouth

01:48.368 --> 01:50.997
- I'm talkin' about Shaft
- Then we can dig it

01:51.038 --> 01:53.542
He's a complicated man

01:53.625 --> 01:57.213
But no one understands him
but his woman

01:57.297 --> 01:59.216
John Shaft

03:14.760 --> 03:16.603
Hey, what's up?

03:28.440 --> 03:30.283
Looking good.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.371
Looks like the kid got clocked with that.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.522
He gonna make it?

03:36.680 --> 03:39.331
Got his head stove in pretty good.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.801
- Witnesses?
- Nope.

03:43.720 --> 03:46.963
- He come from in there?
- He's dressed like it.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.128
You let anybody leave?

03:49.280 --> 03:53.205
- I know the job.
- Hey, I'm just doing mine.

03:54.480 --> 03:57.245
Excuse me. Excuse me.

04:09.880 --> 04:13.123
Was there anything peculiar?
Any commotions?

04:13.280 --> 04:14.566
Did you see...?

04:33.400 --> 04:36.643
All right? You just call her
and say what I told you to say.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.165
Hang up the phone.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.085
You don't worry about my father.
You worry about me.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.288
I'm not gonna argue...

04:47.800 --> 04:51.282
- What?
- How did you get that blood on yourself?

04:52.040 --> 04:53.804
Blood. What blood?

04:53.960 --> 04:56.804
I'm gonna ask you again.
If you give me attitude this time...

04:56.960 --> 04:59.486
I'm gonna drag you out of here
by your hair.

04:59.640 --> 05:03.042
How did you get that blood on yourself?

05:05.560 --> 05:07.403
It was like...

05:08.680 --> 05:10.648
he started it...

05:12.560 --> 05:14.688
and I finished it.

05:20.080 --> 05:24.210
Look, I was razzing the guy.
He couldn't take a joke.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.771
So you cracked his head open.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.162
- Hey, I can dig it.
- He left all pissed off.

05:29.320 --> 05:32.051
I followed him out to apologize.

05:32.200 --> 05:36.000
Next thing I know,
he's coming at me with a silver bat.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.288
I was defending myself.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.084
Anybody see you?

05:40.960 --> 05:43.327
No, officer. It was just
me and him out there.

05:43.840 --> 05:47.845
- Do you know who my father is?
- No. Do you?

05:49.560 --> 05:52.131
- Take him out.
- Let's go.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.049
What's your name?

06:01.600 --> 06:04.683
- Diane Palmieri.
- What'd you see, Diane?

06:06.440 --> 06:07.521
Nothing.

06:07.720 --> 06:10.883
So why you point that guy out to me
when I came in?

06:11.080 --> 06:12.161
I didn't.

06:14.680 --> 06:17.081
- What's that?
- What?

06:23.640 --> 06:27.406
- What did you see, Diane?
- Nothing, I swear. I...

06:30.360 --> 06:33.807
It's a zoo in here. And if I'm working,
how can I see anything?

06:33.960 --> 06:35.610
Detective.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.407
We have a potential witness
you should see.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.928
I'll be back in a minute.
Keep her company, okay?

06:44.520 --> 06:48.445
He did it. That racist bastard.
That's the one that did it.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.409
How do you know? Did you see it?

06:50.560 --> 06:53.962
No. He was sitting over there...

06:54.120 --> 06:57.522
<i>and he was hassling Trey from
the minute we all walked in the door.</i>

06:57.680 --> 07:00.081
Right this way. This table over here.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.605
Yo!

07:08.960 --> 07:11.964
Excuse me, sir. Yo!

07:12.320 --> 07:15.608
- What's up, man?
- They don't serve no malt liquor here.

07:17.760 --> 07:20.969
No malt liquor, all right?

07:21.120 --> 07:23.407
No. All right?

07:24.280 --> 07:25.486
- All right.
- Okay.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.801
- What the hell's your problem?
- Let's go. I wanna go.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.168
- No. No, we're fine. We're fine, okay?
- So embarrassing.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.962
Don't even worry about it.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.050
All right. Have a seat over here.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.725
- What did your friend Trey do?
- Nothing.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.721
He tried to ignore the guy,
but the bastard just wouldn't let up.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.963
No 40s, no chronic.

07:52.040 --> 07:55.010
And no... No indo, all right?

07:55.600 --> 07:58.490
<i>Hey. Hey, dog, is you deaf?</i>

07:58.640 --> 08:02.804
- Holler back!
- What? What an asshole.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.048
You got that, Tupac? All right?

08:05.520 --> 08:08.683
- And then what happened?
- Trey turned the tables on the guy.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.450
What are you doing?

08:10.600 --> 08:12.887
<i>He took one of these
white napkins and</i> a <i>knife...</i>

08:13.040 --> 08:14.929
<i>and he poked holes in it.</i>

08:15.080 --> 08:17.321
<i>Then he walked over
to where the guy was sitting.</i>

08:17.480 --> 08:19.164
I think you dropped this.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.765
<i>And he dropped it on his head.</i>

08:21.720 --> 08:22.926
Bull's-eye.

08:24.520 --> 08:25.760
<i>And everybody laughed.</i>

08:25.920 --> 08:27.649
Take that, chump!

08:28.240 --> 08:30.811
<i>I guess that little prick was pissed.</i>

08:32.159 --> 08:35.323
<i>He was embarrassed
that all his friends laughed at him.</i>

08:39.480 --> 08:43.280
Thank you. You can go
and check on your friend now.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.363
- Getting a low pulse.
- We gotta move.

08:48.760 --> 08:52.401
- We're losing him.
- Let's get rolling.

08:52.560 --> 08:55.689
Tell me he is not the primary on this.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.763
It's his catch, lieu.

08:58.120 --> 09:01.283
Walter Wade, Jr.
You big Walter Wade's son?

09:01.440 --> 09:03.249
- Yes, I am.
- The real estate developer?

09:03.400 --> 09:05.323
Correct.

09:06.320 --> 09:09.085
- Daddy's a big man?
- Big man.

09:09.520 --> 09:11.090
Big man.

09:17.720 --> 09:21.008
The waitress. She saw it?

09:21.800 --> 09:24.485
So, what you do, motherfucker?
Threaten her?

09:32.520 --> 09:35.330
She had to go to the john.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.405
What the...?

09:43.640 --> 09:46.371
- Where'd she go?
- She left.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.085
Shit!

09:59.440 --> 10:02.728
When we get him on board,
I'm gonna intubate.

10:03.480 --> 10:05.369
Let's get that defib ready, guys.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.966
He's starting to seize.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.321
- He's having a seizure.
- I think he's dying.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.960
- Homeboy's got rhythm?
- What?

10:16.280 --> 10:17.281
Damn it.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.683
Was it something I said?

10:21.400 --> 10:22.970
I think my nose is broke.

10:23.120 --> 10:25.202
- I'll clear his airway.
- Excuse me.

10:25.360 --> 10:28.284
- He broke my nose.
- He's going fast.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.528
- There's no air exchange.
- Come on.

10:30.680 --> 10:33.923
Let's get this thing open.
I can't even get a pulse right now.

10:34.080 --> 10:37.129
- Clamp an airway!
- There is chaos on the scene...

10:37.320 --> 10:39.482
Damn, we're losing him!

10:39.640 --> 10:42.041
- Son of a bitch!
- Trey!

10:45.080 --> 10:47.367
I've been waiting for this all year.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.522
You are gone from this precinct.

10:49.680 --> 10:52.968
Gone? For what?

10:58.200 --> 10:59.361
For that?

11:47.760 --> 11:49.842
His roots in the community
couldn't go deeper.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.650
He has no criminal record.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.804
Your Honor, the charge is homicide.

11:54.960 --> 11:58.169
Not having done it before
is not an excuse.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.761
Bail is set at $200,000.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.809
That don't mean shit!

12:16.440 --> 12:17.885
You're a killer, man!

12:32.520 --> 12:33.806
Fuck you!

12:42.440 --> 12:44.329
Can I get a statement from you?

12:54.880 --> 12:57.929
<i>- Shaft.</i>
<i>- It's Walter Wade.</i>

12:58.080 --> 13:00.162
<i>Thanks for breaking my nose that night.</i>

13:00.320 --> 13:02.288
<i>My lawyer says that's why I got bail...</i>

13:02.440 --> 13:06.081
<i>and that's precisely why
I'm skiing in Switzerland right now.</i>

13:06.240 --> 13:08.049
<i>See you when I see you, slick.</i>

13:37.760 --> 13:40.764
Oh, come on, man. You suck.

14:14.120 --> 14:17.602
- John Shaft.
- Carmen Vasquez. Welcome to Narcotics.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.967
- Jimmy Groves.
- Jack Roselli.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.648
You transfer in from the 35?

14:22.840 --> 14:24.842
Yeah. You John Shaft?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.367
- Heard you quit.
- Not yet.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.285
Luger, hurry the fuck up, man.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.971
Come on, you bitch bastard.

14:38.120 --> 14:41.567
Come on, you Billy Bob motherfucker.
Open the goddamn door.

14:41.720 --> 14:44.371
Let's go. Open the fucking door.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.730
That's three Happy Meals or four?

14:49.560 --> 14:51.688
- That's four. And hurry up.
- All right.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.002
Freeze, motherfuckers! Don't move!

14:54.840 --> 14:56.171
Move your fucking ass out of the way!

14:56.320 --> 14:57.367
Police!

14:57.520 --> 14:59.329
Freeze, goddamn it!

15:02.240 --> 15:04.846
Police!
Everybody on the fucking ground!

15:05.000 --> 15:07.207
Everybody freeze!
Grab that motherfucker!

15:07.360 --> 15:09.362
Down on the floor! Now!

15:09.520 --> 15:11.568
Somebody turn that fucking music off!

15:11.760 --> 15:13.520
Get down on your fucking knees.
All right...

15:13.640 --> 15:16.166
- put your hands behind your back.
- Shaft, I got one.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.084
Now you can't speak no fucking English.

15:19.240 --> 15:21.163
I bet you can say "kilo," can't you?

15:21.320 --> 15:24.290
- Hey! Hey, goddamn it! Hey!
- Come here! Come here!

15:24.480 --> 15:27.086
Don't make me chase you!
You're gonna piss me off!

15:27.240 --> 15:28.890
Stop, goddamn it! Stop!

15:29.480 --> 15:31.767
I told you to stop, damn it!

15:50.680 --> 15:52.682
Throw something else!
Throw something else!

15:56.680 --> 15:59.081
Disperse, motherfuckers! Disperse now!

15:59.240 --> 16:00.685
Come on! Come on!

16:07.040 --> 16:09.088
Watch your backs, ladies!

16:29.920 --> 16:32.651
I'm gonna fuck you up for making me run!

16:46.560 --> 16:47.686
You got me, papa.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.527
Peace, motherfucker.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.806
April Fool, motherfucker.

17:44.440 --> 17:46.681
I told you not to make me run, didn't I?

17:48.360 --> 17:50.886
This shit's too tight, yo!

17:51.320 --> 17:54.005
Sit in this car and think about
this ass-whooping you're gonna get.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.891
It's gonna be a long ride to the precinct.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.041
Paraphernalia. Nothing.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.010
- Let me call my wife.
- Shut up, cornbread.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.640
- Let me call my girlfriend.
- I said shut the fuck up.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.529
Easy with the braids, man.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.409
What you got
against black men anyway?

18:10.560 --> 18:12.403
Supposed to be like a factory up there.

18:12.560 --> 18:14.608
Must've gotten a heads-up from someone.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.640
My kid's got more
indictable shit under his bed.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.650
These scales 'll get revolved
before we clock out tonight.

18:19.840 --> 18:22.525
- Look at him.
- Who's that?

18:22.680 --> 18:25.411
Peoples Hernandez.
He's the neighborhood alligator.

18:25.560 --> 18:29.042
It's all his play up here.
He's got about a half dozen apartments.

18:29.200 --> 18:32.443
Keeps changing his shit on us
like it's a shell game.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.045
You enjoying the show?

18:37.480 --> 18:39.721
Yo, sprig, let me see the ball.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.721
Fuck. John, don't do it. Come on.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.405
John, come on. No!

18:49.560 --> 18:50.561
Son of a bitch.

18:50.720 --> 18:54.088
- Good shot.
- Peoples Hernandez, come on down!

18:55.520 --> 18:57.409
Motherfuck.

18:59.240 --> 19:00.924
Yes!

19:04.560 --> 19:08.770
Shaft. You pissed him off
now. Here come the troops.

19:13.760 --> 19:16.240
This is Egyptian cotton, motherfuck.

19:16.400 --> 19:20.564
Two-twenty thread. This is like half
your shitty-assed paycheck, okay?

19:20.760 --> 19:22.205
Step off, Peoples.

19:23.080 --> 19:26.129
You wouldn't know Egyptian cotton
if Pharaoh himself sent it to you...

19:26.280 --> 19:28.760
you knock-off wearing motherfucker.

19:29.200 --> 19:32.568
- You best sleep in that vest.
- Oh, there you go, <i>papi.</i>

19:32.720 --> 19:35.200
You're under arrest
for assaulting an officer.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.731
Stay, Lucifer.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.247
This is the only way you can touch me.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.323
You're one pathetic Kentucky-Fried nigga.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.962
I got some chicken wing for you.

19:56.120 --> 19:58.566
What have we got here?

19:59.960 --> 20:02.008
Concealed weapon.

20:02.160 --> 20:05.926
- The Iceman goeth.
- Goeth for a long time.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.970
Come on...

20:09.120 --> 20:10.724
Step UP-

20:17.160 --> 20:19.447
On the hop, folks. Let's go.
Come on. Let's go.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.328
- Peoples. Peoples.
- Can I get my shoes shined?

20:25.480 --> 20:27.323
Yeah, you sure can.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.683
Home sweet home?

20:35.240 --> 20:36.765
- Stay still, please.
- Yo, Shaft.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.928
I'm gonna put so many lawyers
on your ass...

20:39.080 --> 20:41.401
you're gonna think
they opened a branch office up there.

20:41.560 --> 20:44.689
Lawyers? Lawyers are for punetas.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.129
- I thought you were gonna smoke me.
- I smoke Camels.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.326
It's not my size.

20:52.520 --> 20:54.602
Yo, when the van comes
for these assholes...

20:54.760 --> 20:57.604
this one gets the busted seat belt.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.969
What the hell's he doing here?
Tell me it's something good.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.804
Tell me it ain't one of your dick-arounds.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.327
No. Honest to God, lieu.
I was in fear for my life.

21:06.480 --> 21:10.087
- Yeah, yeah. I know the routine.
- Will you shut the fuck up, cornbread?

21:10.240 --> 21:12.925
Yo, Luger, what's up with the "cornbread"?

21:13.760 --> 21:14.966
Your problem is what?

21:15.120 --> 21:17.248
Nazis with badges. That's my problem.

21:17.400 --> 21:21.166
Nazis?
You gotta lighten up, Shaft.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.641
I talk like this all the time.

21:24.720 --> 21:25.881
I see your point.

21:26.040 --> 21:29.726
Maybe I should take an ethnic-sensitivity
workshop? Fuck you.

21:29.880 --> 21:32.240
Maybe I should workshop my foot
up your ass. How about that?

21:32.360 --> 21:34.169
How about you pick a color, black or blue?

21:34.320 --> 21:36.687
- Hey, fuck you, Luger.
- How about I make you both, Luger?

21:36.840 --> 21:38.240
- Take it easy.
- Anytime, anywhere.

21:38.320 --> 21:41.449
- Nothing between us but air and opportunity.
- Anytime, anywhere, Shaft.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.807
- Come on, motherfucker. Come on!
- Go, go, go!

21:43.960 --> 21:46.884
Yo, Shaft,
I like the way you handled that, brah.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.201
Shut the fuck up!

21:49.040 --> 21:51.407
Yo, Shaft, you got a call.
Guy says it's urgent.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.370
I think it's the clinic. I believe
the test results may have come back.

21:54.520 --> 21:57.251
Today we find out if I'm your daddy
or the German shepherd.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.971
Pretty good.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.482
Well, how good is good?

22:03.880 --> 22:05.564
You're kidding me.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.491
Red, if this is another one of your...

22:08.800 --> 22:10.802
Solid info?

22:10.960 --> 22:13.440
One hundred percent solid?

22:14.040 --> 22:15.963
No shit.

22:16.600 --> 22:17.965
Where?

22:26.040 --> 22:29.362
All right. I got it. All right. Thanks.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.364
Gotcha.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.170
- What's up?
- Old business.

22:36.320 --> 22:38.891
- You need backup?
- No, I got it.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.569
- Rasaan.
- What?

22:41.720 --> 22:45.042
- I'm calling in a favor, son.
- Favor, my ass, motherfucker.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.680
You ain't got no favors
left with me, dog.

22:47.880 --> 22:51.168
Them shits is through.
You done ran all your shits out, baby.

22:51.320 --> 22:54.085
- Look, nigga, don't argue. Just do it.
- All right, dog.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.606
What, Rasaan? What happened?

23:00.360 --> 23:03.045
I gotta do a favor
for my man real quick.

23:48.280 --> 23:49.725
How you doing?

23:49.880 --> 23:51.769
Let's get going.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.361
How you doing, Richie Rich?

23:58.920 --> 24:00.160
Remember me?

24:02.160 --> 24:03.491
Refresh my memory.

24:12.480 --> 24:14.005
Put them on.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.923
Yeah, what's the dilli? Where we off to?

24:26.080 --> 24:28.845
- Fifteenth Precinct.
- Okay, dog.

24:32.280 --> 24:34.248
Hey, yo,
that's my dog Shaft back there.

24:34.400 --> 24:37.847
You know what I mean, that's my man.
Word up. You all right?

24:38.000 --> 24:40.890
Cold, chilly?
You want a jacket or something?

24:52.160 --> 24:55.164
I bet you thought I was sneaking back in.

24:58.280 --> 25:01.648
<i>Crown Heights'. Bed-Stuy!
Yeah! Bed-Stuy!</i>

25:01.800 --> 25:03.689
I'm innocent.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.002
You look depressed, Shaft. You depressed?

25:07.160 --> 25:10.607
Back away from the car.
Back away from the car.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.768
Fuck with the bull...

25:28.960 --> 25:31.167
You get the horns!

25:31.320 --> 25:35.041
Yeah, Shaft! Go on, baby! Yeah!

25:37.040 --> 25:38.883
You the man, Shaft! You the man!

25:39.040 --> 25:42.010
Yeah, you the man! You the man, Shaft!

25:48.160 --> 25:51.528
You know, bro, I'll be out in an hour.

25:51.680 --> 25:54.160
I don't think so, running man.

25:54.360 --> 25:58.490
You see, the van to central processing
left about five minutes ago...

25:58.640 --> 26:02.087
and there won't be another one
for hours and hours.

26:02.240 --> 26:05.403
By the time you get downtown,
we're talking overnight in the tombs...

26:05.560 --> 26:08.404
and they definitely
won't arraign your ass before morning.

26:08.560 --> 26:11.450
It's a shame we didn't get here
a little sooner.

26:16.880 --> 26:19.804
You look depressed, Walter.
You depressed?

26:22.040 --> 26:23.644
Yo, Peops, you still here?

26:23.800 --> 26:27.646
- The seat belt on the van was busted.
- Oh, damn.

26:27.800 --> 26:30.201
It's called habeas corpus, motherfucker.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.528
That mean "due process,"
for the illiterate.

26:33.240 --> 26:37.131
It's called, "You wanted
to play games with me," Peoples.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.443
I know a shitload of games.

26:39.960 --> 26:42.122
You boys play nice.

26:42.920 --> 26:46.322
Teflon don, nigga! Teflon!

26:47.480 --> 26:49.050
Bitch.

26:51.160 --> 26:54.687
<i>Hey, Blanqui,</i> what he <i>get you for?</i>

26:55.160 --> 26:56.969
Income tax evasion?

26:58.760 --> 27:00.091
Fuck you.

27:05.400 --> 27:06.731
Damn!

27:08.120 --> 27:09.721
- What's happening?
- What's up, big boy?

27:09.800 --> 27:14.362
Same old, same old.
Congratulations, man. You was on TV.

27:14.520 --> 27:17.922
Let me get your autograph. You a star.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.002
Mr. P., how you be?

27:23.200 --> 27:25.441
Fine, fine.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.080
- Who's winning?
- Who do you think?

27:29.240 --> 27:31.402
- Hey.
- Congratulations, baby.

27:31.560 --> 27:33.688
Lucky man.

27:34.560 --> 27:37.404
Alice, Alice, ease up on my nephew.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.568
Or that boy's gonna poke
a hole in something.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.684
Uncle J! Hey.

27:43.840 --> 27:48.289
Mr. Big-Time Private Eye.
Hey, I earned my pay today.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.601
Well, you did bring him in.
There's no denying that.

27:51.760 --> 27:53.842
- But what?
- What?

27:54.200 --> 27:56.282
But what?
Come on, come on. Spit it out.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.527
Nothing, nothing.

27:57.680 --> 27:59.967
Listen, so when you gonna
come on board with me, my man?

28:00.120 --> 28:02.805
- Soon.
- Soon?

28:02.960 --> 28:04.325
You're always saying that.

28:05.040 --> 28:09.602
Got a fucking nigga locked up!
Fuck, nigga! What's wrong with you?

28:10.840 --> 28:13.127
You better watch your back!

28:19.560 --> 28:23.042
- We shouldn't fucking be here, man!
- We got busted, man!

28:23.200 --> 28:26.044
- The same bust!
- You making too much money!

28:41.800 --> 28:43.165
Give me your shoes.

28:47.440 --> 28:49.124
They wouldn't fit you.

28:50.640 --> 28:52.688
Oh, shit!

28:52.840 --> 28:55.207
I only ask once.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.525
You want my shoes?

29:21.960 --> 29:25.282
For two years now,
I've been meaning to ask you.

29:25.440 --> 29:30.287
When you dress like this,
where exactly do you strap your piece?

29:30.760 --> 29:32.125
You mean you forgot already?

29:32.280 --> 29:34.806
Well, you know it was
way back in the day.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.561
Oh, yeah. Maybe you should ask Lamont.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.200
Why I gotta ask Lamont?
I'm standing right here.

29:41.360 --> 29:44.011
- Hey! Hey!
- Damn, why you always up on my woman?

29:44.160 --> 29:47.084
- This is the type of shit get a fucker killed.
- He's just playing.

29:47.240 --> 29:50.050
- Playing, my ass.
- I was asking a legitimate-ass question.

29:50.200 --> 29:53.204
Why is it every time you see me talking
to her, you roll up on me like this?

29:53.360 --> 29:55.931
- You feeling insecure?
- Lamont, he's just kidding.

29:56.080 --> 29:58.924
I ain't studying this bullshit.
We can settle this right the fuck now!

29:59.080 --> 30:02.209
- Back up off the motherfucking Armani.
- Fuck you and your Armani!

30:02.400 --> 30:04.562
Surprise!

30:17.880 --> 30:20.770
We got you, baby.
We got you. Surprise, baby.

30:29.440 --> 30:31.761
We got you this time.

30:32.240 --> 30:33.571
All right.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.443
Do you want a smoke?

30:41.160 --> 30:43.606
Don't smoke. Thanks.

30:46.160 --> 30:48.322
My name is Peoples.

30:51.320 --> 30:52.845
You know why they call me that?

30:53.000 --> 30:55.162
Because you always takes care
of your peoples?

30:55.320 --> 30:58.608
Yeah, actually, more or less.

31:02.480 --> 31:04.209
You play golf?

31:05.640 --> 31:08.291
- Not for a while.
- Golf is phat.

31:09.240 --> 31:12.289
Tiger Wood. Tiger Wood.

31:12.440 --> 31:14.010
I like him.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.164
You got a boat?

31:20.000 --> 31:21.684
I had one.

31:25.040 --> 31:27.281
What kind of boat you had?

31:28.080 --> 31:31.846
- A Boston Whaler.
- Boston Whaler.

31:33.520 --> 31:35.045
You been around the world, right?

31:35.520 --> 31:37.727
- Yeah.
- You know something?

31:37.880 --> 31:40.121
I got money longer than train smoke.

31:40.280 --> 31:43.727
I ain't never been on airplane once
my whole goddamn life.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.162
Let me ask you something.

31:46.840 --> 31:48.205
The...

31:51.760 --> 31:56.926
Five family, five borough, one love.

31:57.120 --> 31:58.804
Okay.

32:01.840 --> 32:04.320
You an interesting motherfuck.

32:04.560 --> 32:09.122
You got like a business card or something?

32:10.840 --> 32:13.366
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.761
Don't kiss me, motherfucker.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.365
- All right.
- Night.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.409
- Good night.
- Later, dog.

32:19.560 --> 32:22.689
<i>Back in custody tonight
after a two-year flight from justice.</i>

32:22.840 --> 32:25.571
<i>Wade, seen here after
his arraignment in 1998...</i>

32:25.720 --> 32:28.166
<i>was rearrested by
Detective John Shaft...</i>

32:28.320 --> 32:30.846
<i>as he flew into Westchester
County Airport tonight.</i>

32:31.000 --> 32:34.527
I don't get it.
Why the fuck did he come back?

32:34.720 --> 32:36.484
If it was me, I'd never come back.

32:36.680 --> 32:41.402
Yeah, see, if there ever
was a "but what?" that'd be it.

32:41.600 --> 32:44.171
Come to justice, that kid's old man's
got enough juice here...

32:44.320 --> 32:47.210
to slip his thumb on the scale
and nobody 'll say nothing.

32:47.400 --> 32:50.131
Ain't no fucking way he walks from this.

32:50.320 --> 32:53.403
- No way.
- Really?

33:00.560 --> 33:02.369
Let's roll.

33:03.040 --> 33:05.646
- Good night.
- Night, all.

33:08.760 --> 33:11.047
Such a cynical motherfucker.

33:13.040 --> 33:15.122
You wanna come home with me tonight?

33:15.280 --> 33:18.409
- It's been a while.
- So, what is it this time?

33:18.560 --> 33:22.201
You just wanna be held,
or you want the ID?

33:22.360 --> 33:27.002
What you think it is?
I want the ID, baby.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.808
And then I wanna be held.

33:29.960 --> 33:33.646
- That's all right with you?
- You know me.

33:33.800 --> 33:37.247
It's my duty to please that booty.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.767
Finish up. Let's go.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.764
Kearney, how's retirement?

33:48.960 --> 33:50.086
Catfish are jumping.

33:50.240 --> 33:53.289
Yeah, I heard you bought a big house
out in Nassau County.

33:53.440 --> 33:56.046
Four-bedroom colonial,
right on the water.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.929
Let me ask you something.

33:58.920 --> 34:02.686
How does a third-rate, pencil-pushing,
apple-stealing, dick-head like you...

34:02.840 --> 34:06.208
afford a four-bedroom colonial
in Nassau motherfucking County?

34:06.600 --> 34:08.443
How much they pay you, Kearney?

34:08.600 --> 34:11.524
After working a job uptown for 28 years...

34:11.679 --> 34:14.889
you know what I like best
about where I live?

34:15.320 --> 34:17.402
How do I say this?

34:18.280 --> 34:21.011
It's a restricted community.

34:25.400 --> 34:29.610
Your Honor, my client did not fly home
5,000 miles to jump bail.

34:29.760 --> 34:32.127
- You mean jump bail again.
- No doubt.

34:32.280 --> 34:34.647
He was in the wind for two years, judge.

34:34.840 --> 34:39.050
And if he decides to take off again,
the mood of the people in this city...

34:39.199 --> 34:40.360
Talk about the people!

34:40.520 --> 34:42.806
We can't risk the possibility...

34:42.960 --> 34:47.966
of waiting another two years,
another two months, two days, two hours.

34:48.120 --> 34:52.842
The district attorney's office
is ardently opposed to any kind of bail.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.241
- How about no bail?
- Remove that man.

34:55.440 --> 34:57.283
- Get him out of here.
- How about no bail?

34:57.440 --> 34:59.488
Hey, back up, son! Back up, son!

34:59.640 --> 35:02.007
Hey, son.
Hey, yo, you gonna get your ass twisted.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.407
You better get off me! Get off me!

35:04.560 --> 35:06.767
Your point is well taken, Mr. Torres.

35:06.920 --> 35:11.847
The defendant is hereby ordered
to surrender his passport to this court.

35:12.040 --> 35:15.487
However, I believe that young Mr. Wade...

35:15.640 --> 35:20.771
is sincere in his desire
to deal with whatever form of judgment...

35:20.920 --> 35:24.083
this room deems necessary to deliver.

35:24.240 --> 35:26.891
- Bail is set at one million dollars.
- What?

35:30.760 --> 35:31.886
- No!
- Your Honor...

35:32.040 --> 35:33.883
my client is prepared to post bail.

35:37.360 --> 35:39.408
Oh, no!

35:41.440 --> 35:42.646
Goddamn.

35:48.720 --> 35:51.246
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- I'm out. I'm done.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.731
What, are you nuts? Think.

35:52.920 --> 35:55.002
- Come on, John. This is wack.
- Fuck the job!

35:55.160 --> 35:58.403
<i>- I'll</i> get him my own goddamn way.
- Insane!

36:13.480 --> 36:16.689
- Hey, hey! Hey!
- All right, I'm cool. I'm cool.

36:18.440 --> 36:19.965
I quit.

36:43.840 --> 36:45.171
<i>"SHAFT".
I remember when I took that job...</i>

36:45.320 --> 36:47.687
thinking I could fight the good fight
from the inside...

36:47.840 --> 36:50.650
and you telling me about all the problems.
That color thing.

36:50.800 --> 36:53.280
"Too black for the uniform,
too blue for the brothers."

36:53.480 --> 36:55.562
About how justice
gets tangled up in red tape...

36:55.720 --> 36:57.768
or just bought off by the green.

36:57.920 --> 37:02.084
You were right.
Fuck that job. Fuck the badge.

37:02.280 --> 37:05.648
I'll get that silver-spoon motherfucker
and I'm gonna get him my own way.

37:05.800 --> 37:08.963
No lawyers, no politics,
no rules, no regulations.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.571
- No pension.
- What?

37:10.720 --> 37:13.291
You're too hot, man.
You gotta step off a bit.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.329
- Let me put my people on him.
- No. Hell no.

37:15.480 --> 37:18.211
- His ass is mine.
- Hey, what's the difference?

37:18.360 --> 37:20.601
Got is got.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.325
His ass...

37:23.760 --> 37:25.444
is mine.

37:29.320 --> 37:31.448
I believe we're in pretty
good shape on this.

37:31.640 --> 37:32.687
What about the waitress?

37:32.840 --> 37:35.161
Paul, talk to him. Thank you.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.926
The truth is, Walter, we can't find her.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.050
This guy is great.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.643
You know why we can't find her?

37:42.800 --> 37:45.087
Because she doesn't want to be found.

37:45.280 --> 37:48.602
Now, do you want to go back to Switzerland
while we try and track her down?

37:48.760 --> 37:53.243
It could take a year, two, 10, maybe never.

37:53.400 --> 37:56.290
Meanwhile, everything
and everyone else is in place.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.841
- I don't believe this.
- Look.

37:59.040 --> 38:02.806
Even if she does surface,
she is seriously damaged goods.

38:02.960 --> 38:04.849
It's just a roll of the dice, kid.

38:07.840 --> 38:12.164
<i>- I'll</i> roll my own damn dice.
- Now, Walter... Walter.

38:12.800 --> 38:16.088
- Hello. How are you?
- Hello, my darling.

38:16.240 --> 38:17.685
- How was your day?
- Fine.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.842
So is that my mother's choker?

38:21.160 --> 38:23.561
- Well...
- You gave her my mother's jewelry?

38:23.720 --> 38:26.963
Well, let me... Walter. Walter.

38:28.600 --> 38:29.647
Walter!

39:12.680 --> 39:14.682
Hi, Ms. Palmieri. Remember me?

39:15.720 --> 39:19.008
Look, I really need to talk to Diane.

39:19.160 --> 39:21.162
She don't live here.
She lives in the Bronx.

39:21.320 --> 39:23.482
Yeah, I checked the last address I had.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.927
Well, right now she's in Europe.

39:26.080 --> 39:27.809
- Europe? Where in Europe?
- Spain.

39:27.960 --> 39:30.645
- Spain? I love Spain.
- Maybe Italy.

39:30.840 --> 39:35.004
I never know until I get the postcard.
What can I tell you?

39:37.200 --> 39:38.770
Hey, okay.

39:39.720 --> 39:40.846
Thanks.

39:56.360 --> 39:59.682
I'll probably get fired for this,
but I thought you might need some help.

40:13.800 --> 40:17.327
Terry. From Metronome, right?

40:18.800 --> 40:21.406
- Remember me?
- Yeah.

40:21.600 --> 40:23.568
How did you find me?

40:23.720 --> 40:27.247
Yeah.
I'm free on Monday nights...

40:27.440 --> 40:30.171
Tuesday nights
and every other Wednesday.

40:31.360 --> 40:34.091
Read my mind. Why am I here?

40:34.280 --> 40:37.841
- You're looking for Diane?
- Got it.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.049
- What's in it for me?
- What you need?

40:41.200 --> 40:42.645
Fuck that bitch!

40:42.800 --> 40:44.450
Look down the corner.

40:44.600 --> 40:47.570
See that little nigga,
the one with the red hat?

40:47.720 --> 40:49.688
That's Malik, okay?

40:49.880 --> 40:53.965
Now, my son Tony, he's a real good boy.
A good student.

40:54.120 --> 40:57.886
But he's 12, and I caught him twice
last week running errands for Malik.

40:58.040 --> 41:02.011
I need for that to stop.
Can you handle that?

41:02.840 --> 41:06.128
Everybody on fucking drugs!
Nothing but money, man!

41:07.040 --> 41:11.090
That's Monday, Tuesday
and every other Wednesday.

41:11.280 --> 41:13.408
- Right?
- You got it, baby.

41:16.840 --> 41:19.764
Fucking haves and the should not haves,
motherfucker.

41:20.440 --> 41:23.011
Who the fuck is to say
I shouldn't have shit?

41:23.160 --> 41:27.563
Anybody looking to maintain
their employment with the N.Y.P.D...

41:27.720 --> 41:30.451
it might be in their best interest
to leave now.

41:30.600 --> 41:32.489
<i>Diamonds and pearls
I mean, whoa</i>

41:32.640 --> 41:35.928
<i>Should've seen the lights shine, nigga
Whoa</i>

41:36.080 --> 41:37.127
Yo!

41:39.160 --> 41:42.084
Down! Down! Down! Down! Down!

41:42.240 --> 41:44.129
Man, leave him alone, man!

41:44.320 --> 41:46.322
- What's my name?
- What?

41:47.120 --> 41:49.726
- What's my name?
- I don't know.

41:49.880 --> 41:52.121
- John Shaft!
- What?

41:52.320 --> 41:55.847
- John Shaft! Say it!
- John Shaft.

41:57.040 --> 41:59.566
There's a kid lives up the block
about 12 years old named Tony.

41:59.720 --> 42:01.563
- You know him?
- Yeah.

42:01.720 --> 42:05.566
Wrong answer! There's a kid lives down
the block about 12 years old named Tony.

42:05.720 --> 42:07.561
- Do you know him?
- No, I don't know that kid.

42:07.640 --> 42:09.688
- Stay!
- I don't know that nigga, not no more.

42:09.880 --> 42:12.121
- Quit pointing the gun!
- This kid you don't know.

42:12.280 --> 42:15.921
You see him coming, you run
for your motherfucking life. You got that?

42:16.080 --> 42:18.367
- Do you ever wanna see me again?
- No.

42:18.520 --> 42:20.682
- Do you ever wanna see me again?
- No!

42:20.840 --> 42:22.604
- What's my name?
- I forgot.

42:22.760 --> 42:25.366
- What's my name?
- John Shaft. John Shaft.

42:26.720 --> 42:28.210
John Shaft, yo.

42:28.360 --> 42:29.805
<i>Cleveland is</i>

42:29.960 --> 42:32.088

You answered that?

42:37.440 --> 42:39.090
My bad.

42:41.520 --> 42:43.170

42:43.640 --> 42:46.166
<i>We're not done, hold me down like

<i>The whole eastside, hold me down like

- What the fuck's all that?
- Get the fuck off me!

42:58.520 --> 43:01.285
- Give that back to me, man.
- It worked out great.

43:01.440 --> 43:03.169
Yeah. Okay.

43:03.320 --> 43:05.926
Hey, hey, hey, guys. Break it up.

43:10.280 --> 43:12.282
You're fighting over a bit of rubber?

43:12.480 --> 43:15.529
- He started it.
- No, you always start it.

43:17.840 --> 43:20.525
Here. Jump for it, okay? And behave.

43:22.200 --> 43:24.168
Is that the best you can do? Come on!

43:24.320 --> 43:25.765
You can't handle this!

43:56.640 --> 43:59.291
- Get out of the way. Get out of the way.
- Hey, stop!

44:08.120 --> 44:09.724
Get the fuck out of the road!

44:09.880 --> 44:13.168
What are you fucking doing,
you crackhead?

45:03.240 --> 45:07.404
Leon, the minute she shows up,
you call me, right?

45:07.560 --> 45:09.005
Yeah. All right.

45:09.160 --> 45:11.001
How you gonna get me
into the police academy...

45:11.040 --> 45:12.520
with you chucking your job like that?

45:12.560 --> 45:14.927
- Who lost your rap sheet for you?
- You.

45:15.080 --> 45:18.050
- Who got you that tryout with the Jets?
- You.

45:18.200 --> 45:19.840
- Who got you that gig at the club?
- You.

45:19.960 --> 45:23.806
- Who delivers 10 times out of 10?
- All right, dog. You got it. You.

45:23.960 --> 45:27.089
All right. So shut the fuck up
and call me when she shows.

45:27.800 --> 45:30.371
Why the hell you wanna be a cop...?

45:30.840 --> 45:33.491
Forget I asked. Got milk?

45:33.640 --> 45:35.768
Yeah, I got some milk. You want some milk?

45:35.960 --> 45:37.246
I got a whole bunch of milk.

45:38.480 --> 45:41.450
Mira, no, I am telling you...

45:41.600 --> 45:47.528
Jeter hit one home run,
two doubles and he walk once.

45:48.920 --> 45:51.287
He walk once.

45:58.800 --> 46:01.804
You dressing down
to blend in or something?

46:01.960 --> 46:05.806
You look like a fucking duck hunter.

46:12.680 --> 46:14.921
I need someone located.

46:15.360 --> 46:18.011
Located? What you mean, found?

46:21.960 --> 46:24.281
Located and then what?

46:32.440 --> 46:34.727
That's gonna cost you.

46:42.400 --> 46:44.880
- What am I, a pawnbroker?
- I had it all appraised.

46:45.040 --> 46:47.441
It'll cash out to about 40,000.

46:47.600 --> 46:49.602
- Stole?
- Inherited.

46:50.200 --> 46:52.202
Inherited?

46:56.160 --> 46:57.605
Forty thousand?

46:57.760 --> 46:59.762
Yo, Peoples, it's him.

47:01.880 --> 47:04.406
has <i>been the subject
of fierce racial demonstration...</i>

47:04.560 --> 47:07.882
- That's you.
- The man's fucking famous.

47:08.040 --> 47:10.611
<i>Hundreds of people
were outside the courthouse Monday...</i>

47:10.800 --> 47:13.644
<i>protesting the judge's decision
to grant bail.</i>

47:13.800 --> 47:16.883
<i>The case continues to arouse
fierce passions in this city.</i>

47:17.040 --> 47:19.566
<i>The trial is scheduled to begin
in two weeks.</i>

47:19.720 --> 47:22.200
<i>We are, of course,
following this case very closely...</i>

47:22.400 --> 47:24.448
<i>to bring you the latest developments.</i>

47:26.320 --> 47:31.406
Flaco, Flaco, Flaco,
we got Hollywood right here in the house.

47:36.560 --> 47:38.767
I gotta tell you something.

47:40.640 --> 47:44.406
In this neighborhood,
I am the motherfucking king snake.

47:45.560 --> 47:50.885
I do like this on 181,
three people die on Riverside.

47:51.680 --> 47:54.763
But the thing of it is, you know...

47:54.920 --> 47:57.810
I go downtown, right,
to take a girl out, show her the sights.

47:57.960 --> 48:01.806
I walk into a restaurant,
my stomach's in a knot...

48:01.960 --> 48:04.247
my teeth is clenched,
my hands is in fists.

48:04.440 --> 48:07.125
I don't fit in down there.
People look at me, size me up.

48:07.320 --> 48:10.802
So, like, 10 minutes into it,
I can't wait to come back home.

48:11.280 --> 48:14.966
- I'm like a prisoner, you know?
- Okay.

48:16.320 --> 48:17.890
But youuu...

48:20.920 --> 48:23.969
See, I would kill to be you.

48:25.280 --> 48:29.171
Go where you go. Do what you do.

48:30.120 --> 48:31.929
So this is what I propose.

48:32.080 --> 48:35.448
Okay, the jewelry and shit,
go hock the flash, bring me the cash.

48:35.640 --> 48:37.165
I'm not gonna not take it.

48:37.320 --> 48:39.607
But what I really want?

48:40.240 --> 48:44.006
I want you
to start taking me downtown with you.

48:44.160 --> 48:48.165
I want you to start taking me
wherever you go.

48:51.160 --> 48:53.606
You mean, like, hang out together?

48:53.760 --> 48:55.489
"Hang out." That's good.

48:55.640 --> 48:58.291
Take you to, what, Lutece,
the Harvard Club?

48:58.440 --> 49:01.762
- What the hell are you talking about?
- No, no, no.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.488
When I say "me"...

49:06.120 --> 49:07.963
"me" is this.

49:17.800 --> 49:19.211
Hi.

49:22.640 --> 49:26.281
I want you to front for me, be my face.

49:27.400 --> 49:31.803
Get me some upscale customers.
I would like that very much.

49:31.960 --> 49:34.440
You do that for me,
you get me into your world...

49:34.600 --> 49:37.331
I do that bitch for you. Word is bond.

49:37.920 --> 49:41.561
Man, you're doing a little bit
too much of your own product.

49:41.720 --> 49:45.167
- What?
- Look, it's 40,000.

49:45.320 --> 49:47.448
I thought it was gonna be more,
but that's what it is.

49:47.600 --> 49:49.887
I mean, if it's really important to you...

49:50.040 --> 49:52.611
you can tell everybody
you got a rich white boy on a rope.

49:52.800 --> 49:55.929
I really don't care. But <i>entre nous?</i>

49:56.080 --> 49:59.084
No fucking way.

50:01.200 --> 50:03.601
What's up, Peoples? Let me keep this.

50:04.720 --> 50:06.210
You know...

50:07.080 --> 50:12.530
you took a big risk
coming here all by yourself.

50:12.880 --> 50:13.927
Did I?

50:14.080 --> 50:16.287
- Yo, Peoples, can I keep this?
- No.

50:21.920 --> 50:24.924
- Forty thousand?
- That's what I said.

50:25.120 --> 50:27.885
But this other thing, you can't do for me?

50:28.080 --> 50:31.402
- Not on your life.
- Not on my life?

50:32.200 --> 50:35.010
- Peoples, let me live. Let me keep that ice.
- No.

50:35.160 --> 50:37.401
The man gonna need it
to raise some money.

50:48.480 --> 50:52.644
You drive a hard bargain, Blanquito.

51:35.360 --> 51:37.567
Where the fuck did he go?

51:42.400 --> 51:43.447
Hey!

51:43.600 --> 51:46.171
What is wrong with you,
sneaking around behind me like that?

51:46.320 --> 51:47.651
You wanna die?

51:47.800 --> 51:50.849
- Hey. Come on.
- Get in the car.

51:52.840 --> 51:54.171
<i>He had this...</i>

51:55.480 --> 51:58.211
Money belt stuffed with rocks.

51:58.360 --> 51:59.840
Peoples tell him to cash it in and...

52:01.040 --> 52:02.087
Done deal.

52:02.240 --> 52:04.280
You talking about Walter Wade,
the white boy, right?

52:05.440 --> 52:06.601
From the television.

52:06.760 --> 52:09.047
I tell you, man,
they're gonna kill that white girl.

52:14.400 --> 52:15.401
What's up?

52:15.560 --> 52:17.403
Just getting to know the lay of the land.

52:17.560 --> 52:20.370
- How you doing?
- Yeah, I'm having a conversation here.

52:20.520 --> 52:22.329
The courthouse, man,
that was some rough shit.

52:22.480 --> 52:25.529
Right, right. Sure you're right.

52:30.920 --> 52:33.400
- You sure you're all right?
- Yeah, I'm cool.

52:46.520 --> 52:49.649
Hey, Shaft, I heard you quit la policia.

52:49.800 --> 52:52.883
So I don't think it's right
I still gotta do this shit any more.

52:53.920 --> 52:57.049
Okay, okay. Okay, Shaft, okay.

53:04.360 --> 53:06.727
This guy comes in here...

53:06.880 --> 53:10.123
he's got his drawers
stuffed with jewelry and he asks me:

53:10.280 --> 53:11.770
"Can you locate somebody?"

53:11.920 --> 53:16.369
And I say yeah, because
he's kind of like a celebrity, you know.

53:16.520 --> 53:17.806
You don't want to say no.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.446
I mean, he's coming to me,
it's all flattering and shit.

53:20.600 --> 53:24.889
But the truth of it is, finding people,
that's not really my, as they say, forte.

53:25.040 --> 53:28.328
So this is what I propose.

53:28.480 --> 53:30.642
You detectives and shit, right?

53:30.920 --> 53:32.684
You detect.

53:32.840 --> 53:35.764
So why don't I subcontract to you?

53:35.920 --> 53:39.447
The guy says the shit'll cash out to about 20 Gs.
He's gonna bring it by tonight.

53:39.600 --> 53:43.286
With you I split it down the middle, 50-50.

53:43.440 --> 53:46.011
Easiest money you'll ever make.

53:46.200 --> 53:49.761
You take half, I take half.

53:50.320 --> 53:52.209
Ten large?

53:52.760 --> 53:54.683
Ten thousand.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.651
Alls you gotta do is
tell me where she's at.

53:57.800 --> 54:01.805
- Then what happens?
- Easiest money you'll ever make.

54:12.040 --> 54:14.566
You wanna tell him about Tattoo?

54:14.720 --> 54:17.326
Can I talk to you for a moment?

54:28.040 --> 54:29.451
What?

54:32.160 --> 54:35.164
- Wonder what the market did today.
- How the fuck should I know?

54:57.680 --> 55:00.001
- All the white boys.
- Get the fuck out of here!

55:00.160 --> 55:01.730
No, no, no black people.

55:08.240 --> 55:11.767
I heard you need a job. But this?

55:13.200 --> 55:16.488
You know when guys like you
go down for good?

55:17.360 --> 55:18.725
When they get aspirations.

55:18.880 --> 55:21.451
When they try and rise
above their station.

55:21.600 --> 55:24.763
Now, this contract killing thing
you got with Walter Jr.

55:25.720 --> 55:27.006
Do yourself a favor.

55:27.160 --> 55:30.482
You're a two-bit, three-block dope dealer.
Stick to what you know.

55:31.920 --> 55:34.446
Stick to what I know? Stick to what I know?

55:34.680 --> 55:38.401
Fuck you, motherfucker. I'm a star.

55:41.880 --> 55:44.850
You ain't shit.
You ain't even a fucking pig no more.

55:45.000 --> 55:49.244
Do you think that makes me
less dangerous or more dangerous?

55:49.840 --> 55:52.491
Now, I see you somewhere
I think you don't belong...

55:53.040 --> 55:54.565
I will kill you.

55:58.240 --> 55:59.446
Look.

56:00.160 --> 56:02.970
I respect you. I like you.

56:03.120 --> 56:05.202
That why you always wanna fuck me?

56:24.320 --> 56:25.526
Why you flinch?

56:33.320 --> 56:37.245
- Ms. Palmieri.
- Wait here.

56:39.960 --> 56:42.088
Motherfuckers!

56:44.120 --> 56:46.160
She didn't see nothing,
and she ain't gonna testify.

56:46.280 --> 56:49.250
- You stay the fuck away from my sister!
- No guns! Take it easy!

56:49.400 --> 56:50.447
She's your sister?

56:50.600 --> 56:53.410
Well, if your sister didn't see anything,
why's she running so hard?

56:53.560 --> 56:56.325
- Just leave her be.
- Wade threaten her again?

56:56.480 --> 56:58.289
- Don't move.
- This is fucking bullshit!

56:58.440 --> 57:00.647
If he threatened her,
I can take care of that.

57:00.800 --> 57:03.007
- Just leave her be.
- Frankie.

57:05.400 --> 57:08.370
- Mikey.
- Ma, go back in the house.

57:10.720 --> 57:15.851
- We just wanna talk to her.
- Yeah, sure, with those guns. Get lost.

57:25.160 --> 57:26.605
What do you think?

57:26.760 --> 57:29.684
- They shot a blank.
- Nothing, right?

57:29.880 --> 57:32.645
Nada.

57:32.840 --> 57:36.686
Come on, Shaft. Lead us to that waitress.

57:43.840 --> 57:45.649
I think we're being tailed.

57:57.400 --> 57:59.562
Roselli and Groves.

57:59.720 --> 58:03.406
- They're following us?
- They saw me with Tattoo last night.

58:03.560 --> 58:05.961
Now Peoples is probably
paying them to find Diane.

58:06.120 --> 58:08.327
So, yeah, they're following us.

58:08.480 --> 58:10.721
First Walter, Peoples.

58:10.920 --> 58:12.968
Now these two.

58:13.320 --> 58:15.448
They like to fuck with people?

58:15.600 --> 58:19.286
I guess I'm gonna have to show them
what fucking with people's all about.

58:27.120 --> 58:29.248
47th and Fifth.

58:49.480 --> 58:52.086
- What you staring at, bitch?
- Punk-ass!

58:52.240 --> 58:54.641
You better keep stepping, motherfucker.

58:54.840 --> 58:56.922
Fucking white boy.

59:36.600 --> 59:38.841
Freeze, mofo,
before I bust a cap in your dome!

59:50.960 --> 59:52.450
Fuck!

59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.684
- How'd I sound?
- How'd you sound?

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.366
"Freeze, mofo,
before I bust a cap in your dome."

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:06.285
Oh, pure Notorious P.l.G.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.886
Thank you, man.
That means a lot coming from you.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.283
- How much we get?
- Hang on, hang on.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.647
You are so damn controlling.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:18.883
Forty-two thousand. That's a lot of count
for a simple murder around here.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.930
I know cats that'd take out
a whole zip code for that kind of cheese.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:25.402
No doubt.
Anyways, it's a one-time favor, okay?

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.090
I owe you one.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.403
Hey, you still a motherfucking cracker.
You know that, right?

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.170
Fuck you, too, cornbread.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.405
I'm out.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.080
<i>"PEOPLES".
Well, I gotta tell you...</i>

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.287
The wheels are already set in motion.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:50.411
You know what I'm saying?
You can't just turn off the dogs of war.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.528
Look, I got fucking mugged.

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:56.287
- I have no money.
- I hear you, I hear you, I hear you.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:04.687
Well, I guess you just
got to earn it back.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.530
Ounces are 1,000.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:14.923
Eight-ball's 200. A gram's 80.
It's all prebagged.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.607
And I tell you like I tell all my boys, if
you cut it any more than it already is...

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.967
you can say goodbye
to repeat customers.

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.485
You gotta be shitting me.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.849
You keep coming back,
re-up with me nine or 10 times...

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.403
we should be even-Steven
in about six, eight months.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.968
Is this a fucking joke?

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.764
To keep in touch.

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.761
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Mom, you called me?</i>

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.924
<i>I just want to tell you
those detectives came around.</i>

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.641
<i>- I'm not testifying!</i>
<i>- I know. I know.</i>

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.201
<i>I'm not</i> a <i>bad person. I'm not.</i>

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.328
<i>I know you're not.</i>

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.051
<i>- I won't testify!</i>
<i>- Baby.</i>

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.885
<i>Please, Mom, just keep them away from me.</i>

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.645
Diane?

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:27.050
718-555-2473.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.486
I need a number check.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:33.242
<i>718-555-2473.</i>

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:37.689
<i>Comes up Tony DeCarlo,
114 Cromwell Street, Marine Park.</i>

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.969
<i>And hey, tell Shaft get that bastard.</i>

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.166
He's probably getting
one of those Simonize jobs.

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.767
Let's play games.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.368
- How you doing, partner?
- You ready, Leon?

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.924
Let's roll.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:02.801
Come on, Shaft. Lead us to the prize, baby.

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:19.723
Bro, I gotta pee.

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:27.926
He's sitting right over there.
He'll lead you right to the girl.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.890
- You got our money?
- Oh, yeah.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:34.249
- That boy, the celebrity, he got mugged.
- He what?

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:38.962
Yeah, he showed up at my house all,
like, "no <i>tengo</i> dinero, boss."

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:42.528
- Do I look like a fucking fool to you?
- I don't know.

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:46.082
- Yo, where's our money?
- I just told you he got mugged.

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.163
I mean, that's like an act of God,
you know.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:53.087
- Where is our fucking money?
- He got mugged. Ask him.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.965
Dangerous times are here now.
You got to watch your back, too.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.288
- You watch yours, too.
- New world order.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:04:59.680
You got to be very careful.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.206
Yo, yo, give me Peoples, man.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:15.766
Hello? Who the fuck is this? Hello?

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:20.249
Say exactly what I told you,
word for word.

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.526
I'll blow his motherfucking brains out.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:24.524
- Take it easy. Just be ready.
- What?

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.680
<i>"RASAAN".
Hey, yo, them two jakes you fucking with?</i>

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.326
<i>They robbed the white boy
and they got the money under the seat.</i>

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.881
<i>They playing you, dude.</i>

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.725
- Step out of the car, please.
- Excuse me?

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:56.249
Yo, yo, yo, what's up?
What's this about? What?

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.124
What? What?

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.444
Let's roll, Soul.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:16.845
Oh, shit.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.881
I know what this is gonna sound like,
but we had no idea.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.241
- You know what that's gonna sound like?
- Come on, easy.

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.283
- Shut up.
- If we thought of it...

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:27.523
which we didn't, we would've
taken him out ourselves, okay?

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.411
We're none the less nice people here.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:33.450
But that being said, we delivered.
You got your dough.

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.967
- Now give us our cut.
- Your cut?

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.282
I'll give you your cut,
you thieving motherfucker!

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.363
Give us our fucking money!
We'll kill you!

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:44.241
- Someone's gotta go! Let's all die!
- Hold it! Hold it! Peoples! Yo, Peoples!

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.209
- I saw Shaft. He drove off.
- What?

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:48.931
- I saw Shaft. He drove off.
- Shaft?

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.684
Then who the fuck is that?

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.841
What?

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:07.611
He's playing us. Shaft is playing us.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.928
- You got it, right?
- Yeah, I got it, baby.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:23.290
Hello, can I speak to
Diane Palmiri, Please?

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.602
No, Rasaan. Palmieri.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:29.082
Palmieri! I said I got it, dude.

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:31.766
What the fuck you looking at me
like that for, anyway?

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.851
Hi. Good morning.
I'm from Publisher's Clearing House.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.243
Is Diane Palmiri home
at the moment?

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.325
I don't know who you're talking about.

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.448
Wait a second. I'm saying though...

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.250
Wait a second!
You got some dough coming!

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.483
- Go. Go, go, go.
- Wait a minute! I ain't bullshitting!

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:59.763
Wish this fool'd hurry up
so we could get the fuck out of here.

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.647
It's okay. It's okay!

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.643
- Leave me alone!
- Listen to me!

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.929
Mikey, get your brother
and get over here now.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.208
Yo, Shaft! Yo!

01:08:20.479 --> 01:08:24.371
Shit. You motherfucker
bring me out here for this bullshit.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.210
Be in there, man.

01:08:35.399 --> 01:08:37.720
- What the fuck, brah, let me go.
- I said stay!

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.970
- Yo, Shaft!
- Start the fucking car!

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:05.970
Come on! Come on!

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:17.930
No.

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:21.488
- Yo, get the broad in the fucking car!
- Get in the car! Open the door!

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:25.167
No! You killed my little brother!

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:30.011
You best kill me!
You best kill me, motherfucker!

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.163
You best kill me, motherfucker!
You best kill me!

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:36.529
- Get in the car.
- You best kill me, motherfucker!

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:39.490
You best kill me!

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:44.809
- Let my sister go!
- Diane! Diane!

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.362
- Get out of here, Rasaan! Hurry up!
- Let her go!

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.246
- Diane!
- Fuck you, motherfucker.

01:09:53.399 --> 01:09:56.085
- Calm down!
- I'll choke that motherfucker!

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.720
- She didn't see nothing!
- What the fuck are you doing to her?

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.041
- Go, goddamn it!
- You got me out here with no fucking...

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.521
Mikey!

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.923
You fucked him!

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:08.809
Fuck you!

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.923
- Damn it, you motherfucker, I'll...
- Mikey!

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.931
Mikey!

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.969
This is fucked.

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:44.891
You follow them.

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.805
- Peoples, at this point...
- Look at my little brother!

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:52.010
You follow them, you find out
where they go, and you call me.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:56.131
I'll take it from there.
Don't worry about it, you puerco sucio.

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:07.564
Motherfucker, you owe me now,
Mr. Big-Time Shaft.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:37.367
I tell you, before we get up
in here, I'm gonna have to warn y'all.

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:41.483
I gave the cleaning lady a few years off.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:48.323
You know, let her get her shit together.

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:51.689
Once I pick some of this shit up,
light some candles and incense...

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.367
- everything 'll be just cool.
- Goddamn, Rasaan.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:59.161
- This is like a biohazard in here.
- You're welcome.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.448
Why don't you sit down,
have a seat, relax.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.125
I'm a bad man

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:06.727
- You first. That's nasty.
- What? Sit down.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:09.842
Go ahead. Sit down.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.681
Man, this is some repugnant shit.

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:50.520
Fuck!

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:04.161
Wait a minute! What the fuck is...?

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.403
You come into my life, next thing I know
Shaft put my little brother in a box.

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:09.440
- What?
- Snatched that bitch out from under me.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.960
- Put my brother in a box.
- He what?

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.970
What you mean what? You can't hear me?
You got something in your ear?

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:15.884
You got something in your ear?

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:19.687
No!

01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:29.321
I come back later, put this in your ass.

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.129
You fucking...

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:47.083
Hey, Carmen, I got John Shaft on the line.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.129
Yeah, Peoples.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:52.844
Sixty-eight fifty Norstrom Avenue...

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.651
between Prospect Place and Park Place.

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.850
We'll sit tight in case he makes a move.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.046
<i>I'm a bad man</i>

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:20.048
<i>There was no father there for me
Hey, and...</i>

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.849
<i>Yo, Ra's.</i>

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.048
<i>We would just to go without eatin'</i>

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:27.202
<i>Hey, how you like me now?</i>

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.249
<i>You're a bad man</i>

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:32.091
Hey, yo, big man.
What are you doing over there?

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.641
Come on. Let's get going over there.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.484
Yeah, real funny.

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:40.206
Let me use your phone.
I wanna check on my brother.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:43.762
All right, paisan. Go
check on your fratello.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:59.450
Look, it's just the two of us here.

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.848
You saw it, didn't you?

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:09.365
And it's like a big, flat stone
laying on your chest.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:15.286
You gotta let go of it, Diane.

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:17.920
Trust me on this.

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.686
Just let it go.

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.444
I was on my break.

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:32.291
<i>I went out front to have a cigarette.</i>

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:36.126
<i>I was out there about 10 minutes.</i>

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:42.122
<i>I see the black kid, Trey, coming out.
He was pissed.</i>

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:47.366
<i>Talking to himself,
like, pacing and cursing.</i>

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:50.851
<i>He didn't see me.</i>

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.287
<i>Then, like...</i>

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:57.883
<i>a minute later the Wade guy comes out.</i>

01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.691
<i>He doesn't even break stride.</i>

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:04.243
<i>He snatches up this silver,
I don't know, pole.</i>

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.449
<i>And the Trey kid turns to him,
and he saw him.</i>

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.764
<i>He saw it coming. Just bashes him.</i>

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:18.566
The spray, you know.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.490
Blood.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.449
<i>Then he sees me.</i>

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.090
<i>Wade.</i>

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.921
<i>I wanted to run. I just...
My legs wouldn't move.</i>

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:51.044
<i>And he comes over and pushes me.</i>

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.646
Give me your wallet.

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.007
<i>I didn't understand.</i>

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.847
Diane Palmieri.

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:08.046
You see that?

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:12.091
You want a taste of that?
You want a taste?

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:16.520
You're gonna go back inside,
you're gonna finish your shift.

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:19.126
Then you're gonna go home.

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:23.211
Somebody will call you later tonight.

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.249
Do you understand me?

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.281
<i>I don't even remember going back inside.</i>

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:40.445
I remember talking to you...

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.806
I remember ducking out
the back and going home...

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:49.286
and I got a call like he said I would.

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:51.881
Some guy

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.805
Very smooth, very...

01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:00.604
And the next day I just started running.

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:06.686
I been kind of running ever since.

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.725
Okay.

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:18.602
Now here's the good news.

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.127
You are about to stop running.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.647
- This trial is gonna...
- You don't get it, do you?

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:30.361
I took money.

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:36.366
The man who called me that night,
he offered me $100,000 to get lost.

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:41.407
Half right then, and half after the
disposition of the case. And I said yes.

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:45.569
I took $50,000, and I disappeared.

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:51.769
See, I told myself, I
pointed him out to you.

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:55.766
I fingered that son of a bitch,
and I got him arrested.

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.442
And I told myself that was enough.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.887
But obviously it wasn't.

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:03.642
I mean, obviously.

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:13.843
I'm so sorry.

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.681
These last two years...

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.489
they must've been hell on you.

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.049
What?

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.641
- I could be trading stocks on the Internet.
- Yeah, I could be home watching the Knicks.

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:39.609
Yeah.

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.648
Oh, shit!

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.411
- Could she know about us?
- How the fuck do I know?

01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.324
- Jesus.
- She's coming this way.

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:02.763
- Play it easy. Play it... Stay with me on this.
- Yeah.

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:05.807
- How you doing?
- Hey.

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:10.045
- Hey. What are you guys doing here?
- Watching your back.

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:12.922
I just got here. My back?

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.686
Your back, Shaft's back. You know.

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.605
Well, he never said
where he was gonna be.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.529
The drums. You hear things.

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:25.289
Drums?

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:28.806
He picked a pretty tough
neighborhood to lay low in?

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:32.806
- You wearing your vest?
- No.

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:40.400
- Jesus Christ!
- Hey!

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:44.840
- Shit.
- Police business. Police business.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.650
What the fuck you shooting at now, jake?

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.802
Shooting your ass
if you don't get out of my face!

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:51.361
- Hey, fuck you!
- Step off, assholes. Get a life, girls.

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:55.605
- Hey, get these nuts, cops!
- Go piss in the bed, boy.

01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:58.127
- What?
- Yeah, yeah, keep walking.

01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:01.284
- Keep walking. Yeah.
- Fake-ass cops.

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.208
Oh, shit.

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.485
What next, maestro?

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:34.405
- We finish what we started.
- No shit.

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:53.561
- What the fuck I do with these keys?
- Rasaan!

01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:56.161
- Hurry up. Come on.
- Be right there. Don't rush me.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.970
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:01.090
Come on, Diane. Let's go see the DA.

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:12.049
Get out the window, now!

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.046
Oh, shit!

01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.571
Out! Out! Go!

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:26.050
Motherfucker, you got my house fucked up!

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:29.966
- Go. Let's get them.
- Stay behind me. Come on!

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:35.046
Come on! Come on, Diane!

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.371
Go! Go!

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:52.766
They went out the window!

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:02.326
Hurry the fuck up!

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.764
Come on.

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:15.167
Oh, fuck, man!

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:18.008
Go to the car! Go to the car!

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:20.527
- Come on, go, go!
- This way. This way. This way.

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.171
Why?

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:36.604
My kids. You can't believe what
private schools are charging nowadays.

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:41.161
This is breaking my heart.

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:45.566
Shoot him.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:57.486
It's Giuliani time.

01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.042
Styling.

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:12.411
Go!

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:24.001
Yo, Shaft, get the fuck in the car!

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.643
I'm about to leave
all you motherfuckers, man!

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:31.929
- What the fuck y'all doing?
- Rasaan, shut the fuck up and drive!

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:43.403
Oh, Shit! Fuck! Shit! Fucking...

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:47.801
Hold on, y'all!

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:54.600
Shoot his ass!

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:03.286
Oh, shit! The car!

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.044
Watch that shit!

01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:14.001
You fucking up my car, you pussies!

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:15.969
Just drive, goddamn it! Drive!

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:46.881
We're busted!

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:55.562
Yeah! Shoot all their motherfucking asses!

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:57.051
Yeah! Yeah!

01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:00.727
It's okay. It's okay, calm down. Calm down.

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:04.322
They can't fuck with us!
They can't fuck with us!

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:08.121
You know how I hold it behind the wheel.
They can't fuck with me.

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.605
Hey, Shaft!

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:36.167
No more Teflon don, yo.
No more mayimbe.

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:41.245
I'm a motherfucking dead man.
First to admit it.

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:46.722
Maybe you kill me, or the cops.
Maybe I kill myself. I don't know.

01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:50.965
- What do you think?
- Look, this is between you and me.

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:53.925
- Let her go.
- You know, that's the funny thing, Shaft.

01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:57.169
I'm not your enemy. I'm Peoples.

01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:58.765
- They your enemy.
- Hey! Hey!

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:03.522
I ain't no your enemy. They your enemy.

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:05.569
So now you're doing
Wade's dirty work?

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:07.290
You gonna shoot me, Shaft?

01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:12.128
- All I got is this. Let's go, man.
- Okay.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.129
All right, I'm putting the gun down.

01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:20.082
Mano-a-mano. Come on. Let's go.

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:32.604
Take your woman!

01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:40.685
I'm not your enemy.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.081
I'm Peoples.

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:47.085
I'm Peoples.

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:49.769
Come on, motherfucker. Come on.

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:51.081
You through?

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:21.403
It's okay.

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:32.441
Walter Wade Jr...

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:35.080
the son of wealthy
real estate developer Walter Wade...

01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:37.447
who fled the country
more than two years ago...

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:40.211
has been out on bail
awaiting this day...

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:43.762
to try and convince a jury
of his innocence.

01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:58.885
Hey, she passes through. Let her pass.

01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:00.241
Come on through.

01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:04.044
- Everybody else, back up, please.
- Hey.

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:06.363
This morning we got a whole new lineup.

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:09.683
Got a new judge, the DA himself
is running the prosecution...

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:11.928
and we have an eyewitness.

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:15.289
Today we're gonna get our money's worth.

01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:18.649
I know we will.

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:21.646
- Shaft, can we get a word?
- How you doing?

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:24.565
Mrs. Howard, do you
have a comment on the new prosecutor?

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:27.891
<i>Hey-</i>

01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:31.647
- I'm scared to death.
- Hey, look, you're gonna be fine.

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:33.768
If you feel yourself tightening up...

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:35.843
- Just look for you.
- I'll be there.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.604
Okay.

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.810
Jesus.

01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.644
You don't even have to look at him.

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.245
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:47.402
Okay. Okay.

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:52.282
- I hope you die a slow death!
- Back off! Back off!

01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:57.841
- Guilty!
- Back it off! Let's go!

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.490
No! No, don't!

01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:03.251
Get down!

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:23.209
Let her go! Let her go!
Let her go! Let her go!

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:28.002
<i>Let her go! Let her go!
Let her go! Let her go!</i>

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:32.722
<i>Let her go! Let her go! Let her go!</i>

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:36.963
You still determined to be a private eye?

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:40.522
- I think you're making a mistake.
- I don't.

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:43.405
- Why don't you come in with us?
- I like what I do.

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:45.409
Yeah, right.

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.964
- You Detective Shaft?
- Used to be.

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:56.203
I need to file me an assault charge
against my boyfriend.

01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:58.880
People say I should talk to you.

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:01.088
This is Detective Vasquez. She's...

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.851
She's unavailable at the moment.

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:08.448
See that guy on the phone over there?
When he's done, he'll help you.

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:11.410
- They said I should talk to you.
- I don't work here anymore.

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:14.882
Just have a seat over there.
When he's done, he'll help you.

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:42.490
Write the asshole's name
and where I can find him.

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:45.928
- You can't do that.
- One for the road.

01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:53.964
All right, why don't you
get that looked at?

01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:56.168
I'll see what I can do.

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:04.323
- Now what?
- I guess I gotta pull this asshole's coat.

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:08.403
- Wanna back me up?
- Back you up?

01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.885
Bye.

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:17.445
Bye.

01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:23.128
Good luck to you.

01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:25.051
Damn jerk.

01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:29.481
Yo, Shaft, man, we gotta talk, dog.

01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:31.404

01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:34.689
The deal is, my life is fucked, man.

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:38.162
You know what I mean? I ain't got no car.
I ain't got no business.

01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.004
I can't eat.

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:43.243
You done came by the apartment
and shot up the whole fucking building.

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:46.802
- Landlady wanna put me in the street.
- Calm down, man. It ain't that bad.

01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:48.962
- What?
- It ain't all that.

01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.406

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.489

01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:55.849

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:17.809

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.526

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:23.160
You always take care of me.
I love you for that, baby.

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:26.881
- Come on, let's roll. We got work to do.
- You call this work?

01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:35.846
Yeah, cat.
Yo, say, Shaft, I been thinking, yo.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.843
Y'all should make me an associate...

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.049

01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:43.202

no hard-core detective work.

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:45.607

01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:47.489
of the broads
cheating on their husbands.

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.721
I just wanna hold a camera, dog.

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:51.929
All you'll be holding
is the steering wheel.

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:58.321
Yeah, brother, yeah.
We off into the sunset, brother.
