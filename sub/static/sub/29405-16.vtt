WEBVTT

00:04.103 --> 00:05.580
Get that.

00:05.589 --> 00:06.921
Help on the way.

00:06.924 --> 00:08.532
Hey, put another hose on it.

00:15.924 --> 00:18.465
Anybody here? LAFD.

00:18.468 --> 00:21.094
- Floor looks empty, Cap.
- Let's make sure.

00:21.097 --> 00:22.337
LAFD!

00:22.339 --> 00:24.673
LAFD. Anybody there?

00:24.675 --> 00:26.359
LAFD!

00:30.171 --> 00:32.764
Guys, guys, over here! Over here.

00:37.113 --> 00:39.889
LAFD! Is anyone in here?

00:39.892 --> 00:42.449
Is anyone in here? Cap!

00:42.452 --> 00:44.990
Guys, over here! Sir, are you hurt?

00:44.993 --> 00:47.088
Don't know. Can't get up.

00:47.091 --> 00:48.107
I need O-2!

00:48.110 --> 00:49.906
O-2 coming in.

00:49.908 --> 00:51.366
Get me the mattress carrier.

00:51.368 --> 00:53.386
Hey, can you wiggle
your toes for me, sir?

00:53.388 --> 00:55.712
- All right, there we go.
- All right, mattress secure.

00:55.715 --> 00:57.289
All right, let's pull him up.

00:57.292 --> 01:00.301
Wait. Gladys.

01:01.920 --> 01:05.672
Need to get Gladys.

01:05.674 --> 01:08.216
- He's out.
- Gladys? Who's Gladys?

01:08.218 --> 01:10.385
Might be a cat or a dog.

01:10.387 --> 01:12.596
All right, Buck, we got
this. Go look around out there

01:12.598 --> 01:15.265
- and see if you can find a pet.
- I'm on it.

01:15.267 --> 01:16.534
One, two, three.

01:17.486 --> 01:20.121
Gladys, where are you?

01:23.499 --> 01:25.825
Mayday, mayday. Building is unstable.

01:25.828 --> 01:27.569
We're calling it for
immediate evacuation.

01:27.571 --> 01:29.780
Okay, we're pulling
out. Get him downstairs.

01:29.782 --> 01:31.498
Buck, let's go, let's go.

01:31.500 --> 01:32.591
Gladys?

01:32.594 --> 01:34.639
Come on, Gladys, we really need to go.

01:36.327 --> 01:37.346
Gladys?

01:38.415 --> 01:40.248
Gladys!

01:42.678 --> 01:44.753
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

01:50.190 --> 01:51.330
_

01:51.397 --> 01:52.446
_

01:53.739 --> 01:55.599
_

02:11.299 --> 02:13.084
Possible airway burns.

02:13.087 --> 02:15.283
Let's get her to Sunset General.

02:15.285 --> 02:16.952
We found him on the bathroom floor.

02:16.954 --> 02:18.471
He must've slipped and hit his head.

02:22.051 --> 02:24.021
He passed out as soon as we got him up.

02:24.024 --> 02:25.727
Sir, can you hear me?

02:25.730 --> 02:28.505
Did you get her? Please, tell me.

02:28.507 --> 02:30.413
I got her. I got Gladys.

02:30.416 --> 02:32.675
She is okay.

02:32.678 --> 02:35.470
Oh. That's not Gladys. That's Hoover.

02:35.472 --> 02:37.906
Oh, thank God, Hoover.
But where's Gladys?

02:37.909 --> 02:39.266
Atwater Street incident,

02:39.269 --> 02:40.527
this is Metro Fire Command.

02:40.530 --> 02:42.403
- Please respond.
- Go for Captain Nash.

02:42.405 --> 02:44.905
I have a deaf woman
trapped in apartment 10G.

02:53.095 --> 02:54.299
Gladys.

02:55.492 --> 02:58.467
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

02:59.347 --> 03:01.234
That's as far as the ladders will reach.

03:01.237 --> 03:03.182
The end of her hallway is engulfed.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.458
Frazier just told me there's no access

03:04.460 --> 03:05.592
to the stairwell, either.

03:05.594 --> 03:07.777
Hey, the building next
door is not on fire.

03:07.780 --> 03:09.045
Get to her from the roof?

03:09.047 --> 03:10.961
Rappelling kit's got 150 feet of rope.

03:10.964 --> 03:13.004
That'll get me down
to the street with her.

03:13.007 --> 03:15.343
You want to do a rope
rescue? Of course, you do.

03:15.345 --> 03:16.553
Well, he's not doing it alone.

03:16.555 --> 03:17.639
He's gonna need you on the pulley.

03:17.641 --> 03:19.222
Go, go, go!

03:19.224 --> 03:21.608
Okay, we gotta be ready
here on the ground.

03:21.611 --> 03:24.519
Chim, have a cyanokit on standby.

03:24.521 --> 03:25.814
Dispatch, be advised.

03:25.817 --> 03:28.282
We cannot reach with the ladder.

03:28.284 --> 03:30.617
Please inform the resident
that we will be descending

03:30.619 --> 03:32.378
from the roof through her window.

03:37.552 --> 03:39.242
She's all alone up there.

03:39.244 --> 03:40.911
Anton, I need you to keep still.

03:40.913 --> 03:42.579
Ow!

03:42.581 --> 03:44.004
You're experiencing tenderness?

03:44.007 --> 03:45.315
Been nauseous for days.

03:46.246 --> 03:48.638
So I got antacid stashed
all over the place.

03:48.641 --> 03:51.046
You've had these symptoms for a while.

03:51.048 --> 03:52.919
- Urinating a lot?
- Yeah.

03:52.922 --> 03:55.549
You may have an excess
of calcium in your blood.

03:55.552 --> 03:58.312
Probably from an undiagnosed
thyroid condition.

03:58.314 --> 04:00.013
Just tell me they're
going to get to Gladys.

04:00.015 --> 04:01.648
Anton, don't worry.

04:01.650 --> 04:03.409
We've got our best boys on it.

04:54.629 --> 04:56.212
Get back, okay?

05:27.903 --> 05:29.403
Eddie, I got her. Coming back out.

05:29.405 --> 05:30.645
Copy that.

05:30.647 --> 05:32.665
Fire's getting a little close up here.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.291
We need to double-time it.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.113
Cap, the roof is gone!

05:40.115 --> 05:41.507
Then Buck's gonna have to lower himself

05:41.509 --> 05:43.051
the rest of the way.
You secure that rope,

05:43.053 --> 05:44.210
and you get out of there.

05:44.213 --> 05:46.178
Mitchell, Sanchez, get the airbag.

05:47.998 --> 05:50.160
Line's all yours, Buck.

05:50.163 --> 05:52.453
All right, I got it.
I'll see you down there.

05:54.389 --> 05:55.920
Come on, Buck. Come on, buddy.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.048
Go, let's go! We gotta move!

06:17.211 --> 06:18.785
Oh, my God.

06:18.787 --> 06:20.454
Are you okay?

06:23.626 --> 06:25.038
- Watch her head.
- All right.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.499
We got a 60-year-old male
with smoke inhalation,

07:05.501 --> 07:07.784
mild head lacerations,
syncopal episode at scene.

07:07.786 --> 07:10.837
BP's 150/100, but I did notice
an irregular heart rhythm.

07:10.839 --> 07:12.146
Okay, we're buried here. Thanks.

07:12.149 --> 07:13.599
Okay, hang on, hang on.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.594
This man could have a
serious thyroid problem.

07:15.597 --> 07:17.919
Tell cardiology to order a 12-lead EKG

07:17.922 --> 07:21.089
looking for arrhythmia
associated with hypercalcemia.

07:21.091 --> 07:22.180
Got it.

07:24.149 --> 07:26.686
Whoo! And that was something, huh?

07:26.689 --> 07:29.472
A fire that big, and no fatalities.

07:29.474 --> 07:30.932
We have to celebrate.

07:30.934 --> 07:33.249
We should hit up that
bar on Pico, you know,

07:33.252 --> 07:35.602
the one with the loaded
fries. First round's on me.

07:35.605 --> 07:37.014
Wish I could, man.

07:37.016 --> 07:39.032
Christopher's hosting his
first sleepover tonight.

07:39.034 --> 07:40.626
Hey, you're more than
welcome to come and celebrate

07:40.628 --> 07:41.960
with a bunch of nine-year-olds.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.442
Hah, the rest of us
will toast your absence.

07:45.577 --> 07:47.115
You're gonna have to toast mine, too.

07:47.117 --> 07:49.492
Tonight's date night with Karen.

07:49.494 --> 07:50.739
She can come.

07:50.742 --> 07:52.958
I don't think that's her
idea of a date, but have fun.

07:52.961 --> 07:55.623
Yeah, and I'm sorry,
Buck, but, uh, Athena and I

07:55.625 --> 07:58.552
have a date night tonight, too,
so you guys have a good time.

07:58.554 --> 08:00.336
- Good job.
- Yeah, sure.

08:00.338 --> 08:02.389
See you, Cap.

08:02.391 --> 08:04.500
No offense, but you are not the Buckley

08:04.503 --> 08:06.086
I was looking forward to
spending my night with.

08:06.088 --> 08:07.308
I get it, Chim.

08:07.311 --> 08:10.118
Go wine and dine my
sister. I'll be fine.

08:13.006 --> 08:15.173
Okay, Buckley,

08:15.176 --> 08:18.780
guess we'll celebrate alone.

08:30.919 --> 08:33.203
- I'll take a beer, please.
- You got it.

08:33.205 --> 08:37.499
Heroic firefightr rescue
from blazing inferno.

08:37.501 --> 08:39.684
Tonight at 11:00.

08:42.931 --> 08:44.150
Idiot.

08:46.861 --> 08:48.218
Excuse me?

08:48.220 --> 08:50.345
Running straight into
a hellfire like that,

08:50.347 --> 08:51.865
pulling rope stunts.

08:51.868 --> 08:54.490
Only a moron would do
something that reckless.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.518
Those "morons" are saving lives.

08:56.520 --> 08:57.685
Damn straight.

08:57.687 --> 09:00.021
LAFD.

09:00.023 --> 09:03.066
Best and bravest on
God's green earth, right?

09:07.456 --> 09:08.905
You used to be a firefighter.

09:08.908 --> 09:10.883
Still a firefighter.

09:10.885 --> 09:15.554
Just 'cause you retire doesn't
mean you forget who you are.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.705
Red Delacroix.

09:17.707 --> 09:19.082
Evan Buckley.

09:19.084 --> 09:21.779
Buck. Here, what are you drinking?

09:21.782 --> 09:23.729
No, no, after what you pulled out there,

09:23.731 --> 09:24.971
this round's on me,

09:24.973 --> 09:26.565
but I still think you're an idiot.

09:27.643 --> 09:29.610
Buck.

09:31.930 --> 09:33.739
So I'm telling you,

09:33.741 --> 09:36.909
so we're just bringing down
the last of this litter,

09:36.911 --> 09:38.647
and that mother bobcat,

09:38.650 --> 09:41.758
she's got a laser-beam
focus on Mac and me.

09:41.761 --> 09:44.187
And she saying, "Forget
about the damn the brushfire,

09:44.190 --> 09:47.898
you better not harm one
hair on any of my babies."

09:52.075 --> 09:57.078
Oh, Mac, he bought it in 2002.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.410
Power lines. Chatsworth.

09:58.413 --> 10:00.415
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

10:00.417 --> 10:02.693
- Yeah.
- You must see...

10:02.696 --> 10:04.667
still talk to your old crew
from time to time, right?

10:04.669 --> 10:07.087
I mean, you guys are all still in touch?

10:07.090 --> 10:08.849
At first.

10:08.851 --> 10:12.302
You know, there were
barbecues and parties and...

10:12.304 --> 10:14.170
swapping war stories.

10:15.807 --> 10:17.451
And after that, there
were Christmas cards

10:17.454 --> 10:20.118
and emails about the grandkids.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.454
Nowadays, the only thing that

10:22.456 --> 10:25.198
gets us all together in the same room

10:25.200 --> 10:28.109
is when another one of us is dead.

10:28.111 --> 10:30.653
We're all gonna go eventually, kid.

10:30.655 --> 10:34.040
You just don't want to
be the last one left.

10:34.042 --> 10:36.284
So no grandkids for you?

10:36.286 --> 10:37.970
You'd have to have kids.

10:39.664 --> 10:43.179
I always thought I'd...
I'd get around to it,

10:43.182 --> 10:46.669
but just never happened, you know?

10:46.671 --> 10:49.068
I was too consumed with the firehouse

10:49.071 --> 10:52.985
and being the best and saving lives.

10:52.987 --> 10:55.334
It's hard for a woman
to compete with that.

10:59.643 --> 11:01.776
Oh. You hear that?

11:01.779 --> 11:04.070
- What, Billie Holiday?
- Mm.

11:04.072 --> 11:06.511
The sweet sound of no kids.

11:06.514 --> 11:07.541
Oh.

11:12.822 --> 11:13.863
Mm.

11:13.865 --> 11:15.248
Mm.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.175
You gotta be kidding.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.252
Oh, let's pretend we're not home.

11:19.254 --> 11:20.662
Can't do that. Come on.

11:20.664 --> 11:21.871
All right.

11:21.873 --> 11:23.766
Oh, don't open the door all the way.

11:23.769 --> 11:26.440
You know whoever it is is
gonna want to come inside.

11:27.671 --> 11:28.762
Hen?

11:28.764 --> 11:30.546
Hi, sorry to come by unannounced.

11:30.548 --> 11:31.714
I tried to call you,

11:31.716 --> 11:33.080
but both of your phones were off.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.193
It was going straight to voicemail.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.401
Oh, you two really have
a vibe going on here.

11:37.404 --> 11:39.889
Why do you think we
weren't answering the phone?

11:39.891 --> 11:41.867
Didn't you and Karen
have dinner plans tonight?

11:41.869 --> 11:43.782
We're on our way to the restaurant.

11:43.785 --> 11:45.343
Did you leave her in the car?

11:45.346 --> 11:47.539
She refused to get out the car.

11:47.541 --> 11:51.567
I'm violating the sanctity
of date night or something.

11:51.569 --> 11:54.212
Bobby, they said on
the radio that someone

11:54.214 --> 11:56.531
from that apartment building fire died.

11:56.533 --> 11:58.199
Anton.

11:58.201 --> 12:00.472
The guy with the cat? He
seemed fine at the hospital.

12:00.475 --> 12:02.054
He should've been fine.

12:02.056 --> 12:03.480
I gave that nurse the full rundown.

12:03.483 --> 12:04.890
I even suggested an EKG.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.892
I don't know what we could've missed.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.144
Okay, just let me make a call.

12:12.402 --> 12:14.332
Wow, you two really go
all out for date night.

12:14.335 --> 12:16.384
I'm impressed.

12:16.386 --> 12:18.904
Me and Karen, we're
just going for Mexican.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.694
I need to step up my game.

12:20.697 --> 12:23.241
Your wife is spending date
night alone in her car.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.268
You might want to take a few steps.

12:28.824 --> 12:30.440
What time do florists close?

12:30.442 --> 12:31.992
No, you might want to think bigger.

12:31.994 --> 12:33.159
Google "jewelry."

12:33.161 --> 12:34.304
Mm.

12:35.739 --> 12:37.589
Official cause of death, cardiac arrest.

12:39.334 --> 12:42.761
I told them he might have hypercalcemia.

12:42.763 --> 12:43.953
That's probably what contributed

12:43.955 --> 12:45.171
to his heart failure.

12:45.173 --> 12:46.598
Maybe they didn't have
time to check for it.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.544
They were inundated with
patients from the fire.

12:48.547 --> 12:50.251
- Cap.
- I'm sorry.

12:52.922 --> 12:55.682
We assess the situation,
we treat the patients,

12:55.684 --> 12:57.759
and we pass the information
on to nurses and doctors.

12:57.761 --> 12:58.801
What's the point in doing all that

12:58.803 --> 13:00.312
if they're just gonna ignore it?

13:00.315 --> 13:02.430
Hen, you did your job.

13:02.432 --> 13:04.433
Too bad nobody else did theirs.

13:08.271 --> 13:10.938
You know, I really
didn't need an escort.

13:10.940 --> 13:13.867
Red, just didn't want
you to end up in a ditch.

13:13.869 --> 13:15.919
Whoop!

13:19.800 --> 13:21.049
There we are.

13:22.118 --> 13:24.827
All right, all right. There you go.

13:24.829 --> 13:27.497
Enough good deeds.

13:27.500 --> 13:28.743
You can get home.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.980
I'm all right. I'm all right.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.149
Oh, hey.

13:37.151 --> 13:40.393
This is them, right? This is your house.

13:40.395 --> 13:43.346
Yeah, that's my family. Fightin' 134.

13:43.348 --> 13:45.991
That's our cap, Al Prescott.

13:45.993 --> 13:49.018
And then Phillie, I told you about him.

13:49.020 --> 13:51.071
And then there's Arno, Mac,

13:51.073 --> 13:52.528
and that's me.

13:52.531 --> 13:55.406
We were about your age around then, huh?

13:58.080 --> 13:59.385
John Delacroix.

13:59.388 --> 14:01.197
Well, you didn't think Red was

14:01.199 --> 14:02.998
actually my birth name, do you?

14:03.001 --> 14:04.984
The guys used to call me Code Red

14:04.987 --> 14:06.501
because I was a bit of a hothead

14:06.504 --> 14:08.037
when I was young, huh?

14:08.039 --> 14:09.997
You know about that, don't you, Buck?

14:09.999 --> 14:13.351
The hotheads?

14:13.353 --> 14:14.497
Hey.

14:15.422 --> 14:16.946
Who's this?

14:16.949 --> 14:20.024
Cindy. The one that got away.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.563
We were gonna be married.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.096
What happened with you two?

14:26.033 --> 14:28.241
Our jobs keep us pretty busy.

14:29.703 --> 14:32.112
It's hard for someone not to feel

14:32.114 --> 14:34.683
like they're always
coming in a distant second.

14:34.686 --> 14:37.084
You broke up over the job?

14:38.403 --> 14:41.195
World Series, 1988.

14:41.197 --> 14:44.045
She had got tickets to see
the Dodgers play Oakland,

14:44.048 --> 14:45.408
home game.

14:45.410 --> 14:46.793
And I had already scheduled

14:46.795 --> 14:49.054
a shift, and I figured

14:49.056 --> 14:51.131
nobody was gonna beat the A's anyway.

14:51.133 --> 14:53.800
So I told her I'd make
it up to her later.

14:53.802 --> 14:56.377
And there never was a later.

14:56.379 --> 14:58.870
Gibson hit that homerun in game one,

14:58.873 --> 15:00.974
and by the time the
fifth game came along,

15:00.976 --> 15:03.143
she was gone.

15:06.362 --> 15:08.125
You got anybody, kid?

15:09.484 --> 15:12.560
Me? Uh... no.

15:12.562 --> 15:14.746
I did once, but...

15:14.748 --> 15:15.938
Now listen to me.

15:15.940 --> 15:19.918
You can be the hero, save lives,

15:19.920 --> 15:23.029
but don't neglect having your own.

15:23.031 --> 15:25.948
Last thing you want is to be at the end

15:25.950 --> 15:27.926
holding nothing but regrets.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.533
Trust me.

15:29.536 --> 15:31.503
I know.

15:44.012 --> 15:46.928
Look, I'm just saying
Red is a 40-year veteran

15:46.930 --> 15:49.552
of the department. Two
citations for bravery.

15:49.555 --> 15:52.433
Now he lives alone in
a one-bedroom apartment

15:52.435 --> 15:54.493
he pays for with his pension.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.454
Well, from the way you described him,

15:56.456 --> 15:57.530
it sounds like he's okay with that.

15:57.532 --> 15:59.032
Well, I'm not okay with it.

15:59.034 --> 16:00.033
Nice one, Eddie.

16:00.035 --> 16:01.201
So it's all about you.

16:01.203 --> 16:03.036
No, come on. That's not what I'm saying.

16:03.038 --> 16:05.371
It does seem like his
situation is bothering you

16:05.373 --> 16:06.632
more than it bothers him.

16:06.635 --> 16:08.824
Yeah. I mean, it does bother me.

16:08.826 --> 16:10.605
Look, Red has no friends, no family.

16:10.608 --> 16:13.942
All the guys from the 134,
they don't talk anymore.

16:13.945 --> 16:15.619
It's like they just left him behind.

16:15.622 --> 16:17.833
I'm sure they didn't mean to, Buck.

16:17.835 --> 16:19.027
Life gets busy.

16:19.030 --> 16:20.553
It's easy for people to lose touch,

16:20.555 --> 16:23.297
especially when you don't work
in the same firehouse anymore.

16:23.299 --> 16:25.174
Well, that doesn't make sense to me.

16:25.176 --> 16:26.300
Nice shot, Hen.

16:26.302 --> 16:29.303
I mean, that would never happen to us.

16:29.305 --> 16:31.180
Of course not. We're family.

16:31.182 --> 16:32.974
Yeah, it's never gonna change.

16:32.976 --> 16:35.518
Yeah, like if Bobby retired.

16:35.520 --> 16:36.935
You know something I don't?

16:36.938 --> 16:38.738
Some day.

16:38.741 --> 16:41.314
You know, or one of us
got moved to another house,

16:41.317 --> 16:42.909
we would still all stay in touch.

16:42.911 --> 16:44.689
Exactly. Like you two.

16:44.692 --> 16:46.079
You still keep in touch with the guys

16:46.081 --> 16:47.247
that used to be here, right?

16:47.249 --> 16:49.292
Um, I don't know if we'd call

16:49.295 --> 16:50.678
some of them friends.

16:50.681 --> 16:52.534
I spoke with Tommy last year.

16:52.537 --> 16:55.472
I was calling to ask for a favor, but...

16:57.500 --> 16:59.759
Anyways, that won't happen to us.

16:59.761 --> 17:01.781
Better not.

17:04.266 --> 17:06.132
Dad, Dad, this is dumb.

17:06.134 --> 17:08.768
Now, why couldn't you just
drive to the store like normal?

17:08.770 --> 17:13.347
It's a beautiful, and I wanted
to spend quality time with son.

17:13.348 --> 17:14.866
Sue me.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.035
And if I drove,

17:17.037 --> 17:20.372
then we couldn't ride these babies home.

17:20.374 --> 17:22.115
Yo! Seriously?

17:22.117 --> 17:23.875
Wait, Mom says I'm not allowed.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.193
Mom's not here, is she?

17:26.194 --> 17:28.797
And she's not the boss of me.

17:31.293 --> 17:34.127
- Okay, she is the boss of me.
- Uh-huh.

17:34.129 --> 17:36.145
But she's not here, is she?

17:39.467 --> 17:42.302
- Come on, hop on.
- All right.

17:42.304 --> 17:44.971
- Let's go.
- All right.

17:47.925 --> 17:49.309
Okay. Oh, yeah!

17:49.311 --> 17:50.834
- All right, here we go.
- Do not tell her.

17:53.222 --> 17:54.430
Awesome!

17:54.432 --> 17:55.949
- I knew you'd like it.
- Yep.

17:58.561 --> 18:00.320
Oh, nice move.

18:03.417 --> 18:05.185
I think we should stick to the sidewalk.

18:05.188 --> 18:07.327
- Yeah. Whoa, watch out!
- Whoa!

18:08.780 --> 18:10.163
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

18:10.165 --> 18:11.296
Jeez!

18:11.299 --> 18:12.448
- I think I got the hang of it.
- Yeah.

18:12.450 --> 18:14.592
Yeah.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.469
Hey, what's that noise?

18:21.434 --> 18:22.968
_

18:23.144 --> 18:26.086
_

18:27.182 --> 18:28.681
Sir, can you move in there?

18:28.683 --> 18:30.442
I think I broke my arm.

18:31.686 --> 18:33.260
You're lucky that's all you broke.

18:33.262 --> 18:36.097
These things are death traps,
especially without helmets.

18:36.099 --> 18:39.100
Which I will definitely be
writing him a ticket for.

18:39.102 --> 18:41.361
This thing didn't help.

18:41.363 --> 18:44.438
You're lucky they didn't
crash into oncoming traffic.

18:44.440 --> 18:45.682
Where's Bryce?

18:45.684 --> 18:47.920
Your son is fine. Just
some cuts and bruises.

18:47.923 --> 18:49.203
- I feel terrible.
- Well, you should.

18:49.205 --> 18:50.527
You almost killed them.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.771
Somebody order a chainsaw?

18:51.773 --> 18:53.465
Wait, did he just say "chainsaw"?

18:53.467 --> 18:54.707
I am so sorry. I don't even know

18:54.709 --> 18:55.961
how this happened.

18:55.964 --> 18:57.359
It just... it got away from me...

18:57.362 --> 18:58.494
Whoa! Careful with that thing.

18:58.496 --> 19:00.213
I think it was the wind.

19:00.215 --> 19:01.288
What were you doing flying a drone

19:01.290 --> 19:02.774
over my house in the first place?

19:02.777 --> 19:06.127
It's illegal to fly a
drone over private property.

19:06.129 --> 19:07.330
That's trespassing.

19:07.333 --> 19:09.389
Wha... no, this is just
a big misunderstanding.

19:09.391 --> 19:11.885
I'm a realtor. I was
getting aerial footage

19:11.888 --> 19:13.342
of the neighborhood for a new listing.

19:13.344 --> 19:15.010
Helps sell the full experience.

19:15.012 --> 19:16.829
- Mm.
- I know almost every neighbor

19:16.832 --> 19:17.758
on the street, and I haven't heard about

19:17.760 --> 19:18.741
any of them selling.

19:18.744 --> 19:20.261
Hasn't gone up on the MLS yet.

19:20.264 --> 19:22.184
Well, if you were flying
for your realty company,

19:22.186 --> 19:23.788
then this is a commercial drone,

19:23.791 --> 19:26.239
which should be registered with the FAA.

19:26.241 --> 19:28.690
Can I see your remote pilot's license?

19:28.693 --> 19:30.668
I don't have one.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.246
Company's too cheap to pay for it.

19:33.248 --> 19:34.732
Mm. Jones.

19:35.734 --> 19:38.663
Then I'm guessing they're too
cheap to bail you out of jail.

19:38.666 --> 19:40.799
Wait, you're arresting me? For what?

19:40.802 --> 19:43.014
Operating a drone without a license,

19:43.016 --> 19:44.257
trespassing,

19:44.259 --> 19:47.209
and destruction of private property.

19:47.211 --> 19:48.593
Is this really necessary?

19:48.596 --> 19:50.855
Can't I just pay a fine or something?

19:50.857 --> 19:54.109
Think of it as getting
the full experience.

19:55.529 --> 19:56.569
Watch your head.

19:58.273 --> 20:00.106
Arresting me just feels like

20:00.108 --> 20:01.576
way more trouble than it's worth.

20:01.579 --> 20:03.443
Arresting you is my job.

20:03.445 --> 20:05.060
You want to complain to someone,

20:05.062 --> 20:07.229
save your sob story for the Feds.

20:07.231 --> 20:10.536
This is their jurisdiction.
Rhee, take good care of him.

20:12.950 --> 20:15.076
Come on. Come on. Walk this way.

20:15.079 --> 20:16.595
I wanna talk to my lawyer!

20:16.598 --> 20:18.432
Hey, Gigi, Feds are
gonna want to see this.

20:18.435 --> 20:19.792
Oh, this is a nice one.

20:19.794 --> 20:20.906
Top of the line.

20:20.909 --> 20:22.745
- Expensive?
- For sure.

20:22.747 --> 20:24.516
Probably cost that fool a pretty penny.

20:24.519 --> 20:26.248
Says he uses it for work.

20:26.250 --> 20:27.541
Yeah, well, whoever paid for it,

20:27.543 --> 20:29.710
- it's junk now.
- I want a lawyer!

20:29.712 --> 20:31.754
You want me to log it into evidence?

20:31.756 --> 20:34.307
You think the video card's
still good on that thing?

20:34.309 --> 20:35.725
I mean, the machine took a beating,

20:35.728 --> 20:37.760
but yeah, card should be fine.

20:37.762 --> 20:38.928
- Why?
- I don't know.

20:38.930 --> 20:41.314
Just got a weird feeling I can't shake.

20:41.316 --> 20:43.562
You know what? Get a warrant.

20:43.565 --> 20:46.733
Let's see what he's really
been doing with that drone.

20:46.736 --> 20:47.871
Thanks.

21:02.003 --> 21:04.467
I found her. I found Cindy.

21:05.623 --> 21:07.599
I didn't know she was lost.

21:07.601 --> 21:10.190
Last I heard, she was
living in La Crescenta

21:10.193 --> 21:11.972
with that dentist husband of hers.

21:11.975 --> 21:13.852
Wait, you knew where
she was this whole time?

21:13.855 --> 21:16.278
Well, it wasn't like I
was stalking her, but yeah.

21:16.281 --> 21:19.747
From time to time, I'd learn some stuff.

21:19.750 --> 21:22.471
Did you hear the part when I
told you that she was married?

21:22.473 --> 21:23.973
Ah, not anymore.

21:23.975 --> 21:25.474
He died. Isn't that great?

21:25.476 --> 21:26.951
I mean, not great.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.787
Uh, that's obviously an overstatement.

21:29.789 --> 21:33.274
I'm sure he was a nice man.

21:33.276 --> 21:34.959
When did he die?

21:34.961 --> 21:36.351
A few years back.

21:37.655 --> 21:39.964
So she's been alone all this time.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.217
She doesn't have to be.

21:43.336 --> 21:44.710
She's single.

21:44.712 --> 21:46.379
You're...

21:46.381 --> 21:47.713
seriously single.

21:47.715 --> 21:49.832
Nah, I couldn't. I
mean, that wouldn't be...

21:49.834 --> 21:52.001
Last thing you want

21:52.003 --> 21:55.313
is to be at the end
holding nothing but regrets.

21:56.891 --> 21:59.651
Don't add another regret
to your collection.

22:00.845 --> 22:03.821
Well, her husband just passed, and...

22:03.823 --> 22:06.065
I guess the polite thing to do would be

22:06.067 --> 22:09.661
to go and see her and
pay my respects, huh?

22:10.738 --> 22:12.163
You should change.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.316
You should get the car ready.

22:15.318 --> 22:16.742
All right.

22:30.333 --> 22:33.375
Here. You are gonna want these.

22:33.377 --> 22:34.686
What's this?

22:34.688 --> 22:37.188
Two tickets to the Dodgers-Mets series.

22:37.190 --> 22:39.265
Now they are up in the nosebleeds,

22:39.267 --> 22:42.843
but somehow I don't think
you guys are gonna care.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.037
Hello. Can I help you?

23:10.039 --> 23:12.706
Yes, ma'am. We're here to see Cindy.

23:12.708 --> 23:13.987
Who is it, Doris?

23:13.990 --> 23:16.769
- Well...
- Hey, Cindy.

23:19.232 --> 23:22.383
Oh, my. Oh! Hello!

23:22.385 --> 23:25.737
Oh, what a nice surprise!

23:25.739 --> 23:27.596
You're friends of Mrs. Cindy's?

23:27.598 --> 23:29.390
He is. I'm just a driver.

23:29.392 --> 23:32.318
Please, please, come in, come in.

23:34.772 --> 23:36.914
Thank you.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.044
I'm telling you, we
always had a lot of fun,

23:39.047 --> 23:40.826
but I never saw her run so fast.

23:40.828 --> 23:42.119
From an earthquake?

23:42.121 --> 23:43.996
No... well, I said, "Quake!"

23:43.998 --> 23:45.906
And she thought I said, "Snake!"

23:45.908 --> 23:48.036
And she ran inside.

23:48.039 --> 23:49.613
She slammed the patio door closed,

23:49.616 --> 23:50.874
and she locked me outside.

23:50.877 --> 23:53.622
They make terrible pets.

23:53.624 --> 23:55.675
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no, no, I've heard that.

23:55.677 --> 23:56.913
And with the birds,

23:56.916 --> 23:59.603
I mean, you know I can't, of course...

23:59.606 --> 24:01.880
I've never been much
of a pet person myself.

24:01.883 --> 24:03.755
I can barely keep myself alive.

24:03.758 --> 24:05.685
But I guess with children,

24:05.687 --> 24:08.354
you had all sorts of
animals running around.

24:08.356 --> 24:10.356
You have to fold them very carefully

24:10.358 --> 24:12.858
before you put them in the box.

24:17.340 --> 24:19.106
Uh, hey, Red, maybe we should...

24:19.108 --> 24:22.535
I knew Red once.

24:24.621 --> 24:26.047
Yup.

24:27.231 --> 24:29.991
A long time ago.

24:29.994 --> 24:31.963
You're not Stanley.

24:34.957 --> 24:37.458
Why-why are you in my house?

24:37.460 --> 24:39.345
Who let you into my house?

24:39.348 --> 24:40.977
- No.
- Doris!

24:40.980 --> 24:42.480
I think it's getting late.

24:42.482 --> 24:43.926
Uh, yeah, hey, I think you're right.

24:43.929 --> 24:45.112
We should go. Red, we...

24:45.115 --> 24:47.357
Shut up! I know.

24:47.360 --> 24:51.287
Listen, Cindy, I'm
sorry. I'm sorry for...

24:51.290 --> 24:53.141
really didn't mean to bother you.

24:53.144 --> 24:55.641
I'm just really sorry.

24:55.644 --> 24:57.829
I can't go.

24:57.831 --> 24:59.646
- No, of course.
- Those men...

25:01.000 --> 25:03.817
Yeah, please excuse us.

25:03.819 --> 25:05.503
- It's okay.
- Hey, hey, Red.

25:05.505 --> 25:07.913
I'm sorry, okay? I didn't know...

25:07.915 --> 25:08.914
- Stop!
- I had no idea.

25:08.916 --> 25:10.197
I was trying to help.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.418
Do you even understand
what you just did?

25:12.420 --> 25:14.328
She was all I had left.

25:14.330 --> 25:16.756
Everything else, everyone else is gone.

25:16.758 --> 25:19.374
At least I had these
great memories of her.

25:19.376 --> 25:21.502
The girl that started bar fights

25:21.504 --> 25:23.503
and the girl who was afraid of snakes.

25:23.506 --> 25:25.148
The girl who knew who I was.

25:26.884 --> 25:28.860
Now I don't even have that.

25:28.862 --> 25:30.030
Hm?

25:31.778 --> 25:34.055
- Red.
- Come on, listen to me.

25:34.058 --> 25:36.558
Just stay away from me.

25:36.560 --> 25:40.562
I'm not sure I can
survive your help anymore.

25:47.839 --> 25:49.781
Got your message. You found something?

25:49.784 --> 25:52.123
Yeah, I looked at the most recent file.

25:52.126 --> 25:54.276
It's mainly aerial footage
of the neighborhood.

25:54.279 --> 25:55.911
Yeah, that's what he said he was doing.

25:55.913 --> 25:58.130
But then it gets weird.

26:06.924 --> 26:09.160
That's why he was flying
a drone over her house.

26:09.163 --> 26:10.717
He's a Peeping Tom.

26:10.719 --> 26:12.719
Rhee.

26:12.721 --> 26:14.888
The guy I brought in
earlier, Jeffery Hudson,

26:14.890 --> 26:17.057
bring him up and put
him in interrogation two.

26:17.059 --> 26:18.100
- Drone guy?
- Yeah.

26:18.102 --> 26:19.601
We bounced him out.

26:19.603 --> 26:21.937
What? On whose authorization?

26:21.939 --> 26:24.286
Feds. Said it wasn't worth
the drive across town.

26:24.289 --> 26:26.066
Told us to cut him loose with a warning.

26:33.784 --> 26:36.394
Thought I was heing him but
just made everything worse.

26:36.397 --> 26:38.262
But you didn't mean to, and
I'm sure he'll realize that

26:38.264 --> 26:39.454
once he calms down.

26:39.456 --> 26:41.599
She didn't even know who he was.

26:41.601 --> 26:45.294
For a second, it was like
she was afraid of him.

26:45.296 --> 26:47.563
You don't get over that so easy.

26:50.092 --> 26:53.349
Abby's mom would have moments like that.

26:53.352 --> 26:55.947
You know, Abby would always
just take it in her stride,

26:55.949 --> 26:58.098
but I know it hurt

26:58.100 --> 27:01.810
to have someone you love so much

27:01.812 --> 27:03.788
look at her,

27:03.790 --> 27:05.957
not see her.

27:05.959 --> 27:08.033
You still think about her a lot?

27:08.035 --> 27:09.034
Abby's mom?

27:10.204 --> 27:11.704
Yes, fine, sometimes

27:11.706 --> 27:13.822
I still think about Abby.

27:13.824 --> 27:15.633
But that isn't what this is about.

27:15.635 --> 27:18.696
Okay, so you don't think
this business with Red

27:18.699 --> 27:21.884
is hitting a little close to home?

27:21.887 --> 27:25.717
A lonely hero firefighter
who's pining for his lost love?

27:25.720 --> 27:27.887
I mean, that's ridiculous.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.816
You think I'm lonely?

27:33.044 --> 27:36.896
I think that you tried dating
a few times after Abby left.

27:36.898 --> 27:38.257
Which did not work out.

27:38.260 --> 27:40.182
So you just stop trying?

27:40.184 --> 27:42.159
Look, I know how hard this is.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.903
Do you?

27:43.905 --> 27:45.571
I mean, look, no offense,

27:45.573 --> 27:48.332
but you're never the
one getting left behind.

27:48.334 --> 27:50.001
You're the one who leaves.

27:51.357 --> 27:53.172
And not with Doug.

27:53.175 --> 27:57.750
Okay, Doug definitely
you should've left.

27:57.752 --> 28:00.586
All the guys you dated before him,

28:00.588 --> 28:02.371
the girl you were best friends with

28:02.373 --> 28:05.390
in high school, Mom and Dad, me.

28:08.763 --> 28:11.204
- Buck, I...
- Look, Maddie, I'm not mad.

28:11.207 --> 28:14.525
I'm just saying maybe
you don't understand.

28:14.527 --> 28:17.886
You're always the one who leaves.

28:17.888 --> 28:19.438
You don't know what it's like to watch

28:19.440 --> 28:22.891
someone you love walk away.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.784
Welcome back to The Last
Cook where the losing chefs

28:28.787 --> 28:30.708
from all my other shows
get one more chance

28:30.710 --> 28:32.901
at redemption by me.

28:32.903 --> 28:34.897
Now, we're heading
into the dessert round,

28:34.900 --> 28:37.957
and everything is on the line.

28:37.959 --> 28:41.076
Chef Maurice, what are
you preparing for me here?

28:41.078 --> 28:42.720
Triple bourbon bread pudding, Chef.

28:42.722 --> 28:45.580
Just adding some more
bourbon to the sauce now.

28:45.582 --> 28:47.249
And you've also got bourbon

28:47.251 --> 28:49.526
in the pudding itself
and the whipped cream.

28:49.529 --> 28:50.846
Sure that won't be overpowering?

28:50.849 --> 28:52.304
I want to make sure the vanilla oak

28:52.306 --> 28:53.588
and caramel notes of the bourbon

28:53.590 --> 28:55.090
really come through.

28:55.092 --> 28:57.518
So you're not worried about
repeating old mistakes?

28:57.520 --> 28:58.746
Don't worry, Chef.

28:58.749 --> 29:00.725
Not letting the title get
away from me this time.

29:00.728 --> 29:01.981
It's gonna be great.

29:01.983 --> 29:03.574
Well, you certainly sound confident.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.392
And I'm looking forward to seeing

29:05.394 --> 29:07.060
if the dish lives up to that.

29:07.062 --> 29:10.315
Chef Sharlene, you are
going full on pastry here.

29:10.318 --> 29:12.336
This is my orange-infused
chocolate truffle cake.

29:12.339 --> 29:13.579
Sounds decadent.

29:13.582 --> 29:16.236
And you're doing the
whipped cream by hand.

29:16.239 --> 29:17.509
You're not worried about time?

29:17.512 --> 29:19.590
I'm gonna whip as fast as I can.

29:19.592 --> 29:23.214
Wow. Nitrous whipped cream.

29:23.217 --> 29:25.930
A winning chef would want
the soft peaks and valleys

29:25.932 --> 29:27.006
you get from a hand whip,

29:27.008 --> 29:29.249
not the industrial fluff you get

29:29.251 --> 29:30.792
from pressurized gas,

29:30.794 --> 29:32.678
but, hey, it's gonna be great, right?

29:40.095 --> 29:41.946
Medic!

29:43.922 --> 29:45.622
_

29:45.802 --> 29:47.129
_

29:47.132 --> 29:49.269
The cannister, it just... it exploded.

29:49.271 --> 29:50.880
I don't know how it happened.

29:50.883 --> 29:53.273
Our on-set medics have been
keeping pressure on the wound.

29:53.275 --> 29:55.317
- He's right here.
- We'll take it from here.

29:57.296 --> 30:00.335
Maurice, can you hear me?

30:00.338 --> 30:01.996
He's breathing very shallow.

30:01.999 --> 30:03.824
His pulse is dropping in real time.

30:03.827 --> 30:05.452
Superficial wounds to the head and face.

30:05.454 --> 30:07.138
I got blunt force trauma to the chest,

30:07.140 --> 30:09.122
possibly a few broken ribs.

30:12.503 --> 30:14.895
See what we got here.

30:15.688 --> 30:16.808
Cap.

30:17.922 --> 30:20.012
- How deep is that shrapnel?
- Can't say.

30:20.015 --> 30:21.211
Difference between life or death

30:21.213 --> 30:23.498
this close to the heart
is millimeters, not inches.

30:23.501 --> 30:25.898
Mercy Hospital, this
is Captain Nash, 118.

30:25.900 --> 30:27.900
We have a patient with a
penetrating chest wound.

30:27.902 --> 30:29.068
Have surgeons standing by.

30:31.146 --> 30:32.312
His BP's bottoming out.

30:32.315 --> 30:33.532
I'll bolus another liter of saline.

30:33.534 --> 30:34.815
That's not gonna cut it.

30:34.817 --> 30:36.316
We're still seven
minutes out by my watch.

30:36.318 --> 30:37.393
He's got half of that.

30:37.395 --> 30:39.641
His torso's filling up with blood.

30:39.644 --> 30:41.680
That shrapnel probably
clipped his aorta.

30:41.683 --> 30:42.633
Hen, you have no way of knowing that.

30:42.635 --> 30:44.081
I could do a thoracotomy.

30:44.084 --> 30:46.042
You want to cut him open
in a moving ambulance?

30:46.045 --> 30:47.696
I could just widen the
opening that's already there.

30:47.698 --> 30:49.248
That's a job for a surgeon, Hen.

30:49.251 --> 30:51.830
I'll manually pinch the
aorta just above the injury.

30:51.833 --> 30:53.421
It's a job for a surgeon!

30:53.424 --> 30:55.381
And even if you're lucky
enough to find it, what then?

30:55.383 --> 30:57.101
You're gonna cut off
circulation in his lower limbs?

30:57.103 --> 30:59.645
I'll preserve blood flow to
the heart, lung, and brain.

30:59.648 --> 31:01.690
- Hen, no.
- He's circling the drain, Chim.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.936
You want to send him down it?

31:03.938 --> 31:05.387
He's in VTAC. He's about to code.

31:05.389 --> 31:06.940
I'll give some pressors to stabilize BP.

31:06.942 --> 31:08.411
You do what you want, I'm doing this.

31:08.413 --> 31:09.752
Hen!

31:09.755 --> 31:11.722
Just because you lost
that guy at the fire

31:11.725 --> 31:13.019
does not mean you have to do this.

31:13.021 --> 31:15.114
- Hen, no.
- I did not lose Anton.

31:15.116 --> 31:16.356
The hospital did.

31:16.358 --> 31:17.678
Damn it.

31:25.033 --> 31:26.074
Come on.

31:27.386 --> 31:28.385
Right there.

31:30.056 --> 31:31.872
Almost.

31:33.083 --> 31:34.058
Almost.

31:38.064 --> 31:39.805
I think I got it.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.901
BP's holding. Okay.

31:43.903 --> 31:45.510
Don't let go.

31:45.512 --> 31:48.597
Steady. Lower him down gently.

31:48.599 --> 31:50.018
Be careful, be careful.

31:54.652 --> 31:56.622
- What the hell happened?
- He started crashing.

31:56.625 --> 31:57.748
Too much blood loss.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.274
Did a thoracotomy to stabilize him.

31:59.276 --> 32:00.942
Are you kidding me?
That's a surgeon's job.

32:00.944 --> 32:02.944
Well, it's a job she's
done and done well,

32:02.946 --> 32:04.434
so you might as well tell
us where we're headed.

32:04.436 --> 32:05.923
Hold on.

32:05.925 --> 32:08.167
Type and cross for six
units. Page Dr. Royce.

32:08.169 --> 32:10.540
- We got this, medic.
- No, I got it.

32:10.543 --> 32:13.931
I let for half a second and
he codes before we make the ER.

32:13.933 --> 32:16.267
I'm on this train till
the end. Now which way?

32:16.269 --> 32:17.283
Go.

32:37.198 --> 32:40.040
- What do we got?
- Thoracotomy in the field.

32:41.109 --> 32:43.035
Wow. Someone needed a challenge?

32:43.037 --> 32:44.795
Afraid I didn't have a choice.

32:44.797 --> 32:48.149
Shrapnel appears to have
punctured or nicked the aorta,

32:48.152 --> 32:49.967
which I'm currently
pinching off by hand.

32:49.969 --> 32:51.228
All right, we're gonna clamp the aorta

32:51.230 --> 32:53.119
directly above your finger.

32:53.121 --> 32:55.806
Whatever you do, don't move.

32:58.460 --> 33:01.169
You can let go now, Doctor.

33:02.673 --> 33:04.464
Doctor?

33:04.466 --> 33:06.150
Oh, sorry.

33:07.353 --> 33:08.894
She's not a doctor.

33:08.896 --> 33:11.063
She's the paramedic who brought him in.

33:11.065 --> 33:13.324
Apparently felt the need to
break every rule in the book.

33:15.569 --> 33:17.635
Well, you know what
they say about rules.

33:21.167 --> 33:23.125
You were right about the shrapnel.

33:23.916 --> 33:26.083
Nice work, Firefighter...

33:26.086 --> 33:27.695
Wilson, ma'am.

33:27.698 --> 33:29.632
Henrietta Wilson.

33:38.092 --> 33:40.802
Red, hey. Hey, I came
as soon as I could.

33:40.805 --> 33:42.261
What happened?

33:42.263 --> 33:44.879
I'm sorry. I didn't
know who else to call.

33:44.881 --> 33:47.191
No, no, I'm glad you called.

33:47.193 --> 33:49.974
You said you needed
some help getting home.

33:49.977 --> 33:52.196
I should be so lucky. These...

33:52.198 --> 33:54.865
I've been arguing with these
doctors for the last hour.

33:54.867 --> 33:57.225
They won't release me,

33:57.227 --> 33:59.806
so I think you wasted a trip down here.

34:00.689 --> 34:03.040
Well, they probably know what's best.

34:03.042 --> 34:05.013
They'll release you when you're better.

34:05.016 --> 34:06.784
Oh, kid, there is no better.

34:06.787 --> 34:10.956
This escalator's only
going in one direction.

34:10.958 --> 34:12.716
It's mesothelioma.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.034
I got diagnosed last year.

34:15.036 --> 34:16.409
Actually,

34:16.413 --> 34:19.554
they tell me I lasted longer
than they thought I would.

34:19.558 --> 34:23.226
Well, you know me. Stubborn.

34:23.228 --> 34:26.668
Don't ever want to quit. Until now.

34:26.670 --> 34:29.380
No, there must be
some kind of treatment.

34:29.384 --> 34:31.143
You know, something they can do.

34:31.145 --> 34:32.552
Stop trying to save me.

34:32.554 --> 34:36.097
You're 40 years too late. Hm?

34:36.099 --> 34:37.449
I'm sorry.

34:39.770 --> 34:44.039
Okay, uh, what can I do?

34:45.942 --> 34:48.735
Maybe you could sit
with me for a while, huh?

34:48.737 --> 34:51.755
Unless you got something else to do.

34:54.427 --> 34:55.552
No.

34:56.453 --> 34:59.287
I'm good here.

34:59.289 --> 35:02.123
Hey, you, uh, never told me about Arno.

35:03.269 --> 35:05.177
How did he break his nose?

35:05.179 --> 35:07.346
Well...

35:07.348 --> 35:08.939
that's a good one.

35:08.941 --> 35:10.941
So the call comes in,

35:10.943 --> 35:13.477
and it's in an abandoned
warehouse downtown on Fifth.

35:13.480 --> 35:16.805
Smoke coming out of every window.

35:16.807 --> 35:18.953
So Arno, pretty clumsy...

35:43.166 --> 35:45.881
And they call me a show-off.

35:45.884 --> 35:47.792
Next thing you know, she'll
be doing field transplants.

35:47.794 --> 35:49.388
That's why she needs the coat.

35:49.390 --> 35:52.298
I know, you were right. It
could've gone the other way.

35:52.300 --> 35:54.604
But it didn't, so we put
that in the win column.

35:54.607 --> 35:55.983
We take 'em whenever we can get 'em.

35:55.985 --> 35:57.679
Let's commemorate the first surgery.

35:57.681 --> 36:00.232
- Yes, come on. Dr. Wilson.
- Come on! Come on!

36:00.234 --> 36:01.283
Try it on.

36:02.067 --> 36:03.327
Hen.

36:04.497 --> 36:05.737
Ahh.

36:05.739 --> 36:07.406
- Ooh.
- Ooh, it's nice.

36:07.408 --> 36:08.499
Yes.

36:08.501 --> 36:11.192
Dr. Wilson.

36:11.194 --> 36:12.859
I do like the sound of that.

36:17.392 --> 36:20.368
- I'll send you these.
- Good job, Hen.

36:20.370 --> 36:22.001
Uh... hello?

36:24.165 --> 36:25.831
Looks good on you.

36:25.834 --> 36:27.059
Thanks, Cap.

36:28.336 --> 36:30.211
And I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

36:30.213 --> 36:32.684
It was just... it was just instinct.

36:32.687 --> 36:37.694
And yeah, maybe I was
still mad about Anton dying.

36:37.696 --> 36:41.848
Felt like I had to make sure
that this one stayed a win.

36:41.850 --> 36:44.243
Feels like this is
about more than Anton.

36:45.371 --> 36:47.704
That girl, the cello player.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.706
You're still thinking about her.

36:52.453 --> 36:53.750
Every day.

36:55.530 --> 36:57.622
So how much trouble am I in?

36:57.624 --> 37:00.384
Patient didn't die. No
one's lodged a complaint.

37:00.386 --> 37:03.178
It's a great save. Don't do it again.

37:13.446 --> 37:16.285
Thanks. I'll take him from here.

37:18.237 --> 37:20.261
How'd you get them to spring me?

37:20.263 --> 37:22.652
You know, I, uh, made a few calls.

37:22.655 --> 37:25.150
Actually, it was a lot of calls.

37:25.152 --> 37:28.269
Turns out I am also stubborn.

37:28.271 --> 37:29.536
Don't I know it.

37:29.539 --> 37:31.606
So you're taking me home, right?

37:31.608 --> 37:34.275
No unscheduled stops at the Mayo Clinic

37:34.277 --> 37:37.445
for any groundbreaking
experimental treatment.

37:37.447 --> 37:39.906
Oh, I'm taking you home.

37:39.908 --> 37:41.449
Just not in my car.

37:45.431 --> 37:46.621
Attention.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.701
You did this for me.

38:22.704 --> 38:26.493
Well, you sacrificed
everything for the job.

38:26.496 --> 38:29.831
Least we could do is say thank you.

38:44.565 --> 38:48.808
Firefighter Delacroix, you
take the captain's seat.

39:27.849 --> 39:31.559
He passed away at 5:23 this morning.

39:31.561 --> 39:33.853
The department's gonna
pay for the funeral.

39:37.692 --> 39:39.710
At least he wasn't alone in the end.

39:39.712 --> 39:42.163
You were a good friend to him.

39:42.166 --> 39:45.406
Or did I just do that
thing that I always do

39:45.408 --> 39:47.125
and make it about me?

39:47.127 --> 39:52.041
Try and fix him to
make myself feel better.

39:52.044 --> 39:55.058
Maybe, but you were there
when no one else was.

39:55.060 --> 39:59.671
You know, all he ever wanted
to do was talk about the job.

40:02.425 --> 40:03.925
Really was his whole life.

40:03.927 --> 40:05.551
Evan.

40:05.553 --> 40:07.312
You are not Red.

40:07.314 --> 40:10.574
His life is not your future.

40:10.576 --> 40:13.818
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

40:13.820 --> 40:16.564
Because he didn't have a sister.

40:16.567 --> 40:18.398
He didn't have me.

40:21.069 --> 40:23.962
I know that I left you twice.

40:25.591 --> 40:26.906
Once with Mom and Dad,

40:26.908 --> 40:30.168
and once when things
got rough with Doug,

40:30.170 --> 40:32.095
but I came back.

40:33.247 --> 40:35.130
Because you're my brother.

40:36.918 --> 40:38.459
And I love you.

40:41.014 --> 40:43.131
I love you too.

40:43.133 --> 40:45.442
You're never gonna be left behind.

40:46.636 --> 40:48.612
Okay? No matter what.

40:50.616 --> 40:51.967
You promise?

40:58.532 --> 41:00.499
I promise.

41:06.489 --> 41:07.872
This is unit one.

41:07.874 --> 41:09.991
The suspect in question is now...

41:09.993 --> 41:11.244
- Hey, Lou.
- Hey.

41:12.145 --> 41:13.736
Thanks for coming.

41:13.739 --> 41:15.620
I'm surprised you were interested

41:15.623 --> 41:17.498
to come onto a voyeurism case.

41:17.500 --> 41:19.309
Serial voyeur, and guys like that,

41:19.311 --> 41:21.478
usually the tip of a very dark iceberg.

41:21.480 --> 41:23.221
Follow me around back.

41:25.176 --> 41:27.467
All right, the house is clear,
some clothes were missing,

41:27.469 --> 41:28.893
and the car is gone.

41:28.895 --> 41:31.229
Looks like he packed up in a hurry.

41:31.231 --> 41:32.547
Find anything in the garage?

41:32.549 --> 41:35.349
Well, the techs are
still sifting through it.

41:38.480 --> 41:40.980
Dozens of hard drives, hundreds of files

41:40.982 --> 41:43.667
and folders named after addresses.

41:43.669 --> 41:45.836
Probably more creepy peeping.

41:45.838 --> 41:48.335
It's gonna take a while
to catalogue all of it.

41:48.338 --> 41:49.545
Oh, my God.

41:49.548 --> 41:50.728
Stafford?

41:52.160 --> 41:57.205
I found a video, but
it's not drone footage.

42:11.170 --> 42:14.730
He's not a Peeping Tom.
He's a serial rapist.

42:14.733 --> 42:17.979
And we let him get away.
