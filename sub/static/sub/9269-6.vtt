00:46.280 --> 00:47.919
Good evening.

00:47.920 --> 00:50.839
And a rousing Institute welcome
to tonight's guests,

00:50.840 --> 00:55.439
Lady Felicia, Father Roland,
filling as Locum Curate

00:55.440 --> 00:58.559
during Father Brown's unfortunate
indisposition.

00:58.560 --> 01:02.159
And last but certainly not least,
Mrs Cholmondeley-Carter,

01:02.160 --> 01:04.718
from the National
Executive Committee

01:04.720 --> 01:08.480
who has heroically agreed to act
as head judge at tomorrow's fair.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.799
There was nothing "fair" about
last year's judgment.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.799
The best jam won
and everyone here knows it!

01:19.800 --> 01:22.319
We have a packed evening,

01:22.320 --> 01:25.039
including a cookery talk
from Mrs Hunnisett -

01:25.040 --> 01:27.759
Going Gay Without Meat.

01:27.760 --> 01:32.399
And to kick off, Father Roland's
film, Educating The African Orphan

01:32.400 --> 01:36.079
made during his recent
missionary trip to Swaziland.

01:36.080 --> 01:39.080
So, without further ado,
Andrea, lights please.

01:46.760 --> 01:49.360
Is there a Virginia
in the story?

01:58.440 --> 02:00.599
Oooh! Holy Mother of God!

02:00.600 --> 02:04.519
Father Roland, what is happening?!
No, God. No! Avert your eyes!

02:04.520 --> 02:07.679
This is not a film
about African orphans.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.280
No, it isn't! It is not mine!

02:11.600 --> 02:13.440
Avert your eyes, ladies!

02:16.160 --> 02:18.760
This is not happening!
This is not happening!

02:20.360 --> 02:23.480
Well. This is certainly educational.

02:39.498 --> 02:51.834
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

02:54.720 --> 02:58.719
And finally a cursory inspection
of the church roof account reveals

02:58.720 --> 03:03.439
that fundraising has been, shall
we say, erratic, to say the least.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.559
My Parishioners give what they can.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.199
I'm sure that with
the appropriate nudge,

03:09.200 --> 03:12.800
they can be persuaded
to dig a little deeper.

03:16.320 --> 03:17.760
Raise the roof!

03:19.320 --> 03:20.799
Very pithy.

03:20.800 --> 03:25.159
One to every household in the village. Half a
crown each and we have ourselves a steeple.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.559
And here's mine to start to you off.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.479
Sterling, Mrs McCarthy.

03:29.480 --> 03:32.039
I knew I could count on you
to lead by example.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.839
Am I interrupting? Yes. No.

03:33.840 --> 03:38.080
Her Ladyship thought this might
help with the boredom.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.639
You could do a spot of bird
watching? Feathered variety.

03:42.640 --> 03:46.999
And talking of bird watching,
last night's WI meeting...?

03:47.000 --> 03:48.319
Trust you to bring that up.

03:48.320 --> 03:51.159
I can assure you, the film I gave
to Mrs Fortescue comprised

03:51.160 --> 03:54.399
only of rainless African skies
and smiling black children.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.759
If you say so.

03:55.760 --> 03:59.079
No one doubts that.
But a mystery none the less.

03:59.080 --> 04:02.680
There'll be no more mysteries
for you until that leg is mended.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.320
Really?

04:20.360 --> 04:22.040
Hywel!

04:23.040 --> 04:24.919
On your way to the Post Office?

04:24.920 --> 04:26.999
No flies on you, Father.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.560
Mrs Clam is a comely widow
and your posy tells its own story.

04:33.760 --> 04:37.959
Wild rosemary for warm emotion
and freesias for lasting friendship.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.879
And featherhead for allurement.

04:40.880 --> 04:45.599
Talking of which, I hear the WI meeting
last night took an unexpected turn.

04:45.600 --> 04:49.079
Turns out their VIP was only
the Chief Superintendent's sister-in-law.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.239
Taken to her bed
with the shock of it.

04:51.240 --> 04:52.959
Inspector Sullivan wants answers.

04:52.960 --> 04:56.399
Father Roland gave the film
to Mrs Fortescue.

04:56.400 --> 05:00.199
And she left it at the village hall for the
ladies coming in to set up the meeting.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.719
If I've said it once,
I've said it a thousand times.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.239
You can't go round leaving doors
unlocked these days.

05:05.240 --> 05:09.039
It seems a peculiarly
unladylike crime.

05:09.040 --> 05:13.359
Try telling that to the WI ladies
and on the day of the fair to boot.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.039
Tensions already at boiling point.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.680
Sparks will fly, you mind my words.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.360
I can't stop!

05:30.520 --> 05:31.999
Stay, Jeffrey!

05:32.000 --> 05:33.559
It's always the quiet ones.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.919
Maybe he left one of his films
lying around

05:35.920 --> 05:38.239
and she got it mixed up
with the orphans.

05:38.240 --> 05:41.839
If you've something to say, Judith,
perhaps you'd have the grace

05:41.840 --> 05:43.920
and good manners
to say it to my face.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.160
I'm waiting.

05:48.520 --> 05:51.879
No? Then if you're done spreading
malicious slander

05:51.880 --> 05:54.559
then perhaps you could fetch
more bunting!

05:54.560 --> 05:55.840
Chop chop!

05:58.280 --> 06:00.519
Come, Jeffery!

06:00.520 --> 06:02.440
That woman will be the death of me.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.439
Oi. Father, give that to Father
Brown when you see him, will ya?

06:08.440 --> 06:09.879
This being...?

06:09.880 --> 06:13.719
Donation to the steeple fund
from Mrs Plumpton.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.800
Do I look like a complete greenhorn?

06:17.320 --> 06:18.759
Yep.

06:18.760 --> 06:21.279
I want nothing to do
with this ill-gotten money.

06:21.280 --> 06:25.399
Keep your cassock on. It was a
dead cert and the church roof's got
a dirty great hole in it.

06:25.400 --> 06:29.120
Father Brown should live by example,
instead of falling so publicly to vice.

06:30.320 --> 06:33.279
I was warned he surrounded himself
with undesirables.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.839
But even I couldn't have predicted
the full extent.

06:35.840 --> 06:37.639
Warned were you? By who? The Bishop?

06:37.640 --> 06:40.399
Bishop Talbot has been gracious
enough to take me under his wing.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.520
I bet has!

06:43.040 --> 06:45.159
Planted you here as his little spy.

06:45.160 --> 06:48.359
Recognises qualities in me
lacking in... others.

06:48.360 --> 06:49.999
Even priests can live a little.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.879
All right, ladies!

06:51.880 --> 06:54.039
Looking lovely.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.039
She's taken a shine to you.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.319
Don't be puerile.

06:58.320 --> 07:01.879
Listen, Father, don't take this
the wrong way but...

07:01.880 --> 07:04.319
you're a handsome bloke, all right?

07:04.320 --> 07:06.559
You can have any girl
you wanted.

07:06.560 --> 07:10.280
Why hide your knackers under
a skirt for the rest of your...

07:12.240 --> 07:14.920
Maybe there is a man under
that dress after all.

07:26.160 --> 07:29.759
I wouldn't put it past that one.
Not normal is it?

07:29.760 --> 07:33.039
All that celibacy does funny
things to a man.

07:33.040 --> 07:36.279
Jolly good of you to step
in for Mrs CholmondeleyCarter.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.759
Eleventh hour and all that.

07:37.760 --> 07:41.879
Oh, here's Father Roland.
Righto. Cakes!

07:41.880 --> 07:47.639
One to six are standard fruits,
seven to eleven - Victoria sponge,

07:47.640 --> 07:50.279
12 to 15 are marmalade loaves,
16 to 19 are lemon drizzle.

07:50.280 --> 07:54.000
And here we have
our home-baked bread.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.239
Afternoon, Mrs Bunyon. George!

08:08.240 --> 08:10.720
For me?! Oh!

08:36.360 --> 08:38.120
Hello, hello.

08:40.080 --> 08:44.759
The prize for My Favourite Room
In A Shoebox,

08:44.760 --> 08:48.839
goes to Mrs Sibree for her
"imaginative use of materials"

08:48.840 --> 08:51.880
and "witty" holiday cottage bathroom.

08:59.280 --> 09:01.639
Congratulations. Very well deserved.

09:01.640 --> 09:08.200
Best cake goes to Judith Bunyon
for her Victoria sponge.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.599
That sponge is mine.

09:12.600 --> 09:15.079
I'd recognise it anywhere.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.319
Oh, here we go again.

09:17.320 --> 09:21.319
Hers had sunk in the middle.
She switched the numbers.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.039
I'm sure that's not the case.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.919
This belongs to me.

09:24.920 --> 09:27.679
Now, ladies!

09:27.680 --> 09:29.439
A bitter and twisted fantasist.

09:29.440 --> 09:33.639
No one would put it past you after
the gooseberry jam of 1948.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.679
Was that letter something
to do with you?

09:35.680 --> 09:38.000
Now then, ladies,
that's enough of that.

09:42.840 --> 09:46.199
Why don't you come with me
and have a little cool down?

09:46.200 --> 09:48.280
I'll get you for this,
Judith Bunyon!

09:51.120 --> 09:53.400
Congratulations. Very well deserved.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.280
And the prize
for best scones goes to...

10:05.880 --> 10:07.880
Gladys Clam.

10:25.400 --> 10:28.519
Before you say anything,
it was a blind tasting.

10:28.520 --> 10:34.479
14 years unblemished record...
These scones are an award-winning

10:34.480 --> 10:39.199
secret recipe handed down from my
mother and her mother before that.

10:39.200 --> 10:43.079
This recipe was baked
for His Majesty King George IV

10:43.080 --> 10:47.039
on his visit to Kilkenny Castle
in 1826.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.719
Taste one. Go on.

10:48.720 --> 10:54.440
Taste one and then tell me
they only merit a highly commended!

11:17.840 --> 11:20.439
Deus, Pater misericordiarum,

11:20.440 --> 11:22.479
qui per mortem et resurrectionem...

11:22.480 --> 11:25.839
Pugh. Sir. No Father Brown?

11:25.840 --> 11:29.759
Nasty accident on his bicycle, sir.
That's Father Roland, his locum.

11:29.760 --> 11:33.679
He's staying at the Presbytery.
Does he fancy himself
as an amateur detective too?

11:33.680 --> 11:36.439
I doubt it.
Bit green around the gills.

11:36.440 --> 11:39.919
Needed a moment... outside,
if you get my... Amen.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.839
Oh, and there he goes again.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.799
What do we know
about the dead woman?

11:43.800 --> 11:45.479
Mrs Judith Bunyon. Farmer's wife.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.079
Her husband owns Brook Farm
in Lower Kemble.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.759
Did she have any enemies?
What, foul play?

11:50.760 --> 11:54.359
The colouration of the face
looks like cyanide poisoning.

11:54.360 --> 11:57.679
There was a bit of a hoo-ha
with Miss Thimble earlier,

11:57.680 --> 12:00.679
but then show day does tend to
bring out the worst in the ladies.

12:00.680 --> 12:03.359
Mrs Clackett narrowly escaped
a charge of ABH last year,

12:03.360 --> 12:05.799
after a bust-up
over her cherry Bakewell.

12:05.800 --> 12:09.039
And last night's incident
hasn't helped matters.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.639
Any connection there?

12:10.640 --> 12:12.439
Can't see it myself, sir.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.399
Sergeant! Get this to the lab.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.799
I want a toxicology report on my
desk by the end of the day. Sir.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.879
We'll take it from here, Pugh.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.320
Yes, sir.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.959
By the sound of it, I think
we can rule out natural causes.

12:32.960 --> 12:39.079
So, Mrs M, what can you tell us
about the dead woman?

12:39.080 --> 12:42.519
Judith was a troublemaker
and no mistake,

12:42.520 --> 12:46.359
a woman who took great delight
in spreading malicious gossip.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.599
And he who is without sin...

12:48.600 --> 12:52.959
And Vera Thimble wasn't the only one
she fell out with today.

12:52.960 --> 12:57.119
Mrs Fortescue caught Judith
pointing the finger at her Jeffrey

12:57.120 --> 13:00.839
over last night's cinematic
catastrophe.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.559
Tore a strip off her
in front of half the WI.

13:03.560 --> 13:05.399
Did she, now?

13:05.400 --> 13:07.479
Mm, somebody's got their mojo back.

13:07.480 --> 13:10.119
Yes, well, I'm no used to anyone
stuck in this chair.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.679
Oh, fiddlesticks.
Your brain's in one piece.

13:12.680 --> 13:16.359
And if you need any legwork doing,
consider me at your disposal.

13:16.360 --> 13:19.759
You?! Why not me?

13:19.760 --> 13:24.879
Well, I've always put you down
as decorative rather than useful.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.599
Decorative?!

13:26.600 --> 13:29.720
Tell me, Father. Am I "decorative"?

13:31.000 --> 13:34.119
As a rosary is both beautiful
and with purpose.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.399
I think it's up to Father Brown

13:36.400 --> 13:39.479
to decide which of us
is the more useful.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.640
Quite. Father?

13:54.240 --> 13:56.279
After you.

13:56.280 --> 13:57.959
No, after you.

13:57.960 --> 14:00.559
So much for your offer of help.

14:00.560 --> 14:03.959
If I recall correctly,
Father Brown asked us both to help.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.439
Huh!

14:05.440 --> 14:07.919
These are Chanel gloves.

14:07.920 --> 14:11.840
Oh, really? Well, I'm sure there's
plenty more where they came from.

14:13.360 --> 14:14.960
Stand aside, Mrs McCarthy.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.960
Oh, really! Oh.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.000
Oh, gosh.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.719
A Kembleford postmark.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.239
Why waste a stamp?

14:30.240 --> 14:33.799
Proverbs chapter 19, verse 9.

14:33.800 --> 14:37.119
"A false witness shall not
be unpunished,

14:37.120 --> 14:40.919
"and he that speaketh lies
shall perish."

14:40.920 --> 14:44.159
Judith Bunyon spread malicious
gossip aplenty.

14:44.160 --> 14:47.479
And the numbers?
A code of some sort?

14:47.480 --> 14:49.959
It's a puzzle. That's what it is.

14:49.960 --> 14:53.679
It's a threat, judging by her
reaction when she read it.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.359
So what do we do now?

14:55.360 --> 14:58.679
First things first, someone should
take it to the police.

14:58.680 --> 15:01.000
I will.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.359
I see.

15:05.360 --> 15:09.399
Well, if Father Brown says it's
significant, that's good enough for me.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.880
I'll make sure
the inspector gets it.

15:13.960 --> 15:17.160
Is there any news
on how Mrs Bunyon died?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.039
You didn't hear it from me,
but...

15:24.040 --> 15:26.599
murder it looks like.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.359
Cyanide poisoning.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.439
Her Victoria sponge
was laced with wasp killer.

15:31.440 --> 15:32.760
No!

15:53.080 --> 15:55.759
Is this anything to do with you?

15:55.760 --> 15:58.400
Why on earth would I do
something like that?

16:03.760 --> 16:06.559
Then we paid a visit to the Post
Office, where we managed

16:06.560 --> 16:08.919
to identify the writing paper
by its watermark.

16:08.920 --> 16:12.679
Mrs Clam had only got
in half a dozen

16:12.680 --> 16:16.839
and was obliging enough to remember
who had purchased them.

16:16.840 --> 16:20.119
Three of those were at the WI fair.

16:20.120 --> 16:23.559
Vera Thimble, Dinah Fortescue...

16:23.560 --> 16:25.880
and Mrs McCarthy.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.599
For the parish office!

16:29.600 --> 16:33.119
Well, you might as well say
Father Brown wrote that letter.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.520
Or...

16:37.880 --> 16:39.639
Father Roland...

16:39.640 --> 16:43.519
Now you really are being ridiculous.

16:43.520 --> 16:47.600
Who gave the film
to Dinah Fortescue.

16:49.760 --> 16:54.639
I think Vera Thimble also received
an anonymous letter

16:54.640 --> 16:57.880
which sent her hurtling
to Dinah Fortescue.

16:59.840 --> 17:04.479
I think we need to find out
what was in Miss Thimble's letter.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.719
How on earth do we do that?

17:06.720 --> 17:09.640
I think... we should ask her.

17:11.280 --> 17:14.159
'..And I'm also culling
a few of these birds.

17:14.160 --> 17:17.680
'You can do it if you like, Grace. Any good
at wringing necks? Heavens, no!'

17:24.400 --> 17:27.160
Oh. I didn't hear you come in.

17:30.240 --> 17:32.040
Ah!

17:34.840 --> 17:36.400
Hello! Hello?

17:53.000 --> 17:54.479
Miss Thimble.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.400
Ah, Miss Thimble!

17:58.840 --> 18:02.199
Jesus, Mary and Joseph! Oh!

18:02.200 --> 18:05.759
Oh, this is no time to have
a fit of the vapours.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.640
I think she's had a visitor.

18:09.640 --> 18:12.879
I suppose it's up to me
to go and get help, then.

18:12.880 --> 18:14.799
Well, stay there.

18:14.800 --> 18:18.000
And don't touch anything.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.760
Sorry.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.879
Oh, dear...

19:01.880 --> 19:03.560
Indeed!

19:04.720 --> 19:07.839
Oh!

19:07.840 --> 19:12.480
Long John Silver in the 4:10.
Oh, yes!

19:18.480 --> 19:20.120
Sid!

19:22.760 --> 19:24.199
May I help you?

19:24.200 --> 19:28.639
Yes, erm... can't reach
the Parish Magazine.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.520
I wonder if you...

19:35.200 --> 19:39.240
I'm enjoying your article.
"Sports Day In Swaziland."

19:40.520 --> 19:44.839
Egg and spoon race
with an ostrich egg. Very good.

19:44.840 --> 19:48.599
Who is the young lady who appears
to have pipped you to the winning post?

19:48.600 --> 19:50.679
A volunteer with
the Catholic Mission.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.079
Mr Plunkett telephoned
to book a christening.

19:53.080 --> 19:56.840
At last. Three weeks overdue,
poor woman.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.639
I must say,

19:59.640 --> 20:03.839
you and your missionary friend look very
at your ease amongst the orphans.

20:03.840 --> 20:06.679
More at ease than I am
with your record-keeping.

20:06.680 --> 20:10.359
If you'll excuse me,
I must telephone the Bishop

20:10.360 --> 20:12.399
to update him on my progress.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.919
A written reminder
for your personal diary,

20:14.920 --> 20:16.839
assuming you possess such a thing.

20:16.840 --> 20:20.640
Yes, well, give my regards
to Bishop Talbot.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.840
Oh, I will.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.240
Oh, yes. Of course!

21:23.520 --> 21:25.999
So we assume she knew her killer.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.959
Well enough to offer her tea.

21:27.960 --> 21:31.599
There was a cup on the table,
stained with lipstick.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.319
Vera Thimble never wore lipstick.

21:33.320 --> 21:35.599
Well spotted, Mrs M.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.599
At which point I had to leave
to fetch the police,

21:38.600 --> 21:41.920
as Her Ladyship
was feeling vapourish.

21:43.880 --> 21:49.039
The murder weapon was a hatpin,
ivory, inexpensive but distinctive.

21:49.040 --> 21:52.519
Apart from the teacups,
the room was undisturbed

21:52.520 --> 21:54.839
and there was one of those
on a table.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.199
Father Roland's latest initiative.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.879
Father Roland seems to be making
a habit of being present

21:59.880 --> 22:01.199
at crime scenes.

22:01.200 --> 22:05.479
He delivered one of those envelopes
to every house in the parish, Sidney.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.319
As for the letter,

22:07.320 --> 22:09.639
we are none the wiser.

22:09.640 --> 22:11.839
Actually, we are.

22:11.840 --> 22:14.720
I found it in her handbag.

22:17.320 --> 22:19.839
Were you tampering
with the crime scene, Lady F?

22:19.840 --> 22:22.399
It sounds rather thrilling
put like that.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.439
But I suppose I did.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.719
And it was identical.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.199
Proverbs 19:9.

22:29.200 --> 22:33.479
Two, eight, one, one, one,

22:33.480 --> 22:39.120
nine, two, six, nine, zero, zero.

22:40.240 --> 22:43.120
If only we knew what it meant.
I think I might know.

22:50.480 --> 22:53.120
28th November 1926, nine o'clock.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.000
Ooh! Shh!

23:03.400 --> 23:05.720
Read that.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.600
Shh!

23:17.560 --> 23:21.399
Albert Evans was a local man
and thoroughly bad lot.

23:21.400 --> 23:25.839
Drunkard, wife-beater and known
predator on underage girls.

23:25.840 --> 23:28.479
Daisy Butler was just 14
when she was found raped

23:28.480 --> 23:30.679
and strangled in Kemblebrook Wood.

23:30.680 --> 23:33.519
He was convicted and hanged
at Pentonville Prison

23:33.520 --> 23:37.439
on the 28th November 1926
at... 9am...9am.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.079
But there's more.

23:39.080 --> 23:42.399
The evidence against him
was overwhelming but circumstantial.

23:42.400 --> 23:45.519
What secured his conviction
was the eyewitness testimony

23:45.520 --> 23:48.879
of three women on their way home
from a WI meeting -

23:48.880 --> 23:51.279
Vera Thimble, Judith Bunyon...

23:51.280 --> 23:53.000
And Dinah Fortescue.

23:55.600 --> 23:59.319
Young man, be aware my husband plays
golf with the Chief Constable,

23:59.320 --> 24:01.799
so you'd better have
an extremely good reason

24:01.800 --> 24:03.880
for this extraordinary behaviour.

24:05.280 --> 24:07.319
Do you recognise this?

24:07.320 --> 24:09.719
Where the blazes did you find that?

24:09.720 --> 24:11.279
Is it yours?

24:11.280 --> 24:14.639
Lost it weeks ago.
Dropped out in the street.

24:14.640 --> 24:16.959
Ruddy things never stay in.

24:16.960 --> 24:20.439
Can I ask what brand of lipstick
you wear, Mrs Fortsecue?

24:20.440 --> 24:23.159
You most certainly may not.

24:23.160 --> 24:26.600
Is it Elizabeth Arvon
Roseberry Crush, by any chance?

24:27.680 --> 24:29.279
What the devil...?

24:29.280 --> 24:32.359
Found it by Miss Thimble's body,
along with your fingerprints.

24:32.360 --> 24:36.279
Poppycock! I haven't set foot
in that woman's house in years.

24:36.280 --> 24:38.999
You were seen having a heated
argument with her

24:39.000 --> 24:40.959
shortly after
Judith Bunyon's murder.

24:40.960 --> 24:42.519
Can I ask what that was about?

24:42.520 --> 24:44.559
It was a private matter.

24:44.560 --> 24:47.599
And the fracas yesterday
with Mrs Bunyon at the WI fair,

24:47.600 --> 24:49.719
was that also a private matter?

24:49.720 --> 24:52.039
I pulled her up
on malicious tittle-tattle,

24:52.040 --> 24:53.319
if that's what you mean.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.520
About the unfortunate mix-up
at Friday's WI meeting?

24:58.520 --> 25:03.319
Mrs Fortescue, are you aware
that your husband was arrested

25:03.320 --> 25:06.719
in a raid on a pornographic
cinema in Soho?

25:06.720 --> 25:08.799
He was never charged.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.799
He's a county court judge.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.999
If this came to light, I don't think
he'll be playing golf

25:14.000 --> 25:16.599
with the Chief Constable
any time in the near future.

25:16.600 --> 25:17.999
Meaning?

25:18.000 --> 25:21.519
I think both dead women found
out about your husband's activities

25:21.520 --> 25:24.280
and threatened to expose him.
So you killed them.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.279
Dinah Fortescue,

25:29.280 --> 25:31.799
I'm arresting you on suspicion
of the murders

25:31.800 --> 25:34.039
of Judith Bunyon and Vera Thimble.

25:34.040 --> 25:36.999
You are not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so,

25:37.000 --> 25:39.080
but whatever you do say...

25:40.520 --> 25:44.800
Hmm. Angel AND saint
rolled into one, Mrs M.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.119
Father?

25:48.120 --> 25:50.679
Not now... please?

25:50.680 --> 25:56.399
Father, may I congratulate you
on a rousing homily this morning?

25:56.400 --> 25:59.759
Temptation
and the sins of the flesh.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.879
I look forward to reading it.

26:01.880 --> 26:06.359
I hope I can tempt you
to a slice of lemon drizzle.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.359
No, thank you.

26:08.360 --> 26:11.039
I'm fasting, followed
by a prayer vigil in the church.

26:11.040 --> 26:14.119
This evening, you are normally
glued to the wireless.

26:14.120 --> 26:17.639
The Sunday Half Hour
is Father Roland's only vice,

26:17.640 --> 26:19.639
I sometimes think.

26:19.640 --> 26:23.079
I thought the choristers from
King's College Cambridge last week

26:23.080 --> 26:24.999
were particularly fine.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.840
Or was it Christ Church, Oxford?

26:30.880 --> 26:32.679
There's been a development!

26:32.680 --> 26:37.039
Oh! Good afternoon, Father.
Delightful homily this morning.

26:37.040 --> 26:39.200
I'll leave you
to your diversions.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.000
Sid.

26:43.120 --> 26:47.079
Dinah Fortescue's been charged
with both murders.

26:47.080 --> 26:50.519
The hatpin was hers and her
fingerprints were on a teacup.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.519
Have they established a motive?

26:52.520 --> 26:56.319
It all leads back to Albert Evans.

26:56.320 --> 26:59.959
Three women testified against him -
two of them are dead,

26:59.960 --> 27:01.840
and the third is in a police cell.

27:02.880 --> 27:05.679
This mentions a wife.
Do we know where she is?

27:05.680 --> 27:07.719
About 100 yards away. Where?

27:07.720 --> 27:10.959
In the graveyard. Oh. She drowned
a month after his execution.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.199
Almost certainly suicide,

27:13.200 --> 27:17.079
but they gave her the benefit
of the doubt and a Christian burial.

27:17.080 --> 27:18.879
Ah!

27:18.880 --> 27:21.919
The everyday china's good enough
for the likes of you,

27:21.920 --> 27:25.559
and you will find that downstairs
in the kitchen.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.480
Dear God and all the saints.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.839
What, Mrs M?

27:30.840 --> 27:34.439
Vera Thimble had
a Royal Doulton tea service.

27:34.440 --> 27:38.479
Never missed an opportunity to
mention it or get it out in public,

27:38.480 --> 27:42.839
but the cup found at the scene
was cheap everyday china.

27:42.840 --> 27:45.559
The sort of thing she wouldn't
give house room to.

27:45.560 --> 27:48.999
A rogue cup, planted
at the scene of the crime?

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
Ahem. My homily...

27:53.120 --> 27:54.559
for your perusal.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.000
Thank you.

28:02.480 --> 28:05.320
Planted by the real murderer.

28:07.600 --> 28:10.640
We need to have a chat
with Dinah Fortescue.

28:15.400 --> 28:18.319
I'm sorry, ladies,
but you aren't authorised.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.079
I'll come clean with you, Constable.

28:20.080 --> 28:22.119
Father Brown believes
there's about to be

28:22.120 --> 28:23.839
a grave miscarriage of justice.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.919
Does he, now? How's that, then?

28:25.920 --> 28:27.839
He's not quite sure just yet...

28:27.840 --> 28:31.039
But knowing Father Brown, he'll
get it all worked out in the end.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.559
Exactly.

28:32.560 --> 28:35.200
All right. Just... Just ten minutes.

29:11.680 --> 29:15.239
It's all just a fearful bloody
mess of a misunderstanding

29:15.240 --> 29:18.439
and no-one who's anyone
will believe it for a second.

29:18.440 --> 29:21.719
Vera Thimble received
an anonymous letter.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.639
Not from me.

29:23.640 --> 29:27.280
Did you know that Judith Bunyon
received one also?

29:28.680 --> 29:32.360
The 28th November 1926, 9am.

29:33.720 --> 29:36.560
The execution of Albert Evans.

29:38.440 --> 29:39.759
I'd like you to leave.

29:39.760 --> 29:42.799
You're going on trial
for double murder.

29:42.800 --> 29:45.999
The police have enough evidence
to convict you twice over and,

29:46.000 --> 29:50.679
I have on impeccable authority,
intend to push for a death sentence.

29:50.680 --> 29:54.840
So whatever you're concealing,
I hope it's worth hanging for.

29:58.640 --> 30:01.040
It was all such a long time ago.

30:02.640 --> 30:06.359
Daisy Butler was just 14
when she was lured into the woods,

30:06.360 --> 30:07.959
strangled...

30:07.960 --> 30:09.400
and worse.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.240
Kembleford was rocked to the core...

30:15.160 --> 30:19.399
like we'd woken up one day to find
the devil living amongst us.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.639
Forgive me, Lord, and lead me
not into temptation,

30:22.640 --> 30:24.959
but deliver me from evil.

30:24.960 --> 30:26.919
Lead me not into temptation,

30:26.920 --> 30:28.639
but deliver me from evil.

30:28.640 --> 30:32.520
Lead me not into temptation.
Get thee behind me, Satan!

30:35.360 --> 30:39.039
Albert Evans was a known predator
on young girls.

30:39.040 --> 30:42.999
The van he driving was identical
to the one we saw.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.999
He had no alibi.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.680
Not a person in Kembleford, including
his own wife, doubted his guilt.

30:50.120 --> 30:54.199
But without eye witnesses,
he'd have got off scot-free.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.800
It was unthinkable.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.760
Good evening, Hywel.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.799
Or should I say Stephen?
I had hoped, with you laid up,

31:21.800 --> 31:24.800
there'd be one less detective
to worry about.

31:25.880 --> 31:29.279
Well, I couldn't help noticing
the flowers on your mother's grave,

31:29.280 --> 31:32.240
the birdsfoot trefoil for revenge...

31:33.640 --> 31:36.200
on those who testified
against your father.

31:38.840 --> 31:40.400
12 years old.

31:44.160 --> 31:47.959
My father, a murderer and rapist.

31:47.960 --> 31:50.199
My mother, a suicide.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.760
What happened to you?

31:53.560 --> 31:55.280
I was sent to my nan's in Tywyn.

31:56.720 --> 32:01.920
She changed my name so no-one would
know I was the devil's spawn.

32:04.120 --> 32:07.479
Not that it stopped them
finding out.

32:07.480 --> 32:10.999
"Hangwell" they called me
at school.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.679
Kiddies can be very cruel like that.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.879
As for Nan...

32:15.880 --> 32:19.520
she locked her bedroom door
every night I was under her roof.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.960
Can't be too careful, see.
Like father, like son.

32:25.720 --> 32:27.080
You poor little boy.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.800
I'm so very, very sorry.

32:32.520 --> 32:34.040
Thank you, Father.

32:35.560 --> 32:38.319
I think you're the first person
who's ever said that.

32:38.320 --> 32:41.199
Mind if I take a pew? It's been
a shocking day on the feet.

32:41.200 --> 32:42.840
Be my guest.

32:47.920 --> 32:50.119
I expect you've got some questions.

32:50.120 --> 32:51.959
Yes.

32:51.960 --> 32:55.399
I was wondering why you bothered
sending the letters

32:55.400 --> 32:57.519
when it can only draw
attention to yourself.

32:57.520 --> 32:59.199
Well, that's easy.

32:59.200 --> 33:02.239
I wanted them to feel the fear
my father did...

33:02.240 --> 33:05.879
Oh! I didn't hear you come in.

33:05.880 --> 33:08.079
'..To know they had died

33:08.080 --> 33:10.239
'for what they'd done.'

33:10.240 --> 33:13.519
Horribly cunning.
Well, from you, I'll take that as

33:13.520 --> 33:18.039
a complement, Father. Although truth
be told, it was surprisingly simple.

33:18.040 --> 33:21.399
So, kindly refrain
from chasing every young girl

33:21.400 --> 33:23.800
all around the fete,
if you wouldn't mind.

33:25.880 --> 33:28.640
Am I making myself clear? Very.

33:30.760 --> 33:32.640
'Who notices a policeman?

33:35.040 --> 33:37.240
'First on every crime scene.

33:43.520 --> 33:45.560
'Access all areas.'

33:56.240 --> 33:59.159
I assume it was you
who switched Father Roland's film

33:59.160 --> 34:03.719
at the Women's Institute. Here's me,
biding my time for the right moment

34:03.720 --> 34:07.559
and then a records check turns up
Justice Jeffrey's activities.

34:07.560 --> 34:09.960
You murdered two innocent women...

34:11.120 --> 34:12.998
and framed a third...

34:13.000 --> 34:14.839
for telling the truth.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.840
Well... Well, Father...

34:18.480 --> 34:21.839
it seems like you don't know
everything after all.

34:21.840 --> 34:24.239
Not one of them is innocent.

34:24.239 --> 34:28.119
They murdered my father, as surely
as if they'd pulled the lever on the drop.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.478
It didn't feel like lying.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.400
It felt like justice.

34:33.600 --> 34:36.518
By the trial, I think I truly
believed that Bert Evans

34:36.520 --> 34:38.560
was the man I saw that night.

34:39.639 --> 34:43.880
And then some 20 years later, the
real killer was caught and confessed.

34:45.320 --> 34:50.520
Albert Evans was declared
posthumously innocent and pardoned.

34:52.679 --> 34:56.079
So, you took matters into your
own hands. An eye for an eye.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.879
Vengeance is the Lord's.

34:58.880 --> 35:00.719
He will repay.

35:00.720 --> 35:03.119
I can't wait till
the Day of Judgment.

35:03.120 --> 35:06.079
I wanted to watch them
atone for their crimes

35:06.080 --> 35:09.919
and for one of them at least,
to suffer as my father did.

35:09.920 --> 35:12.639
The opportunity for one
of them to die a long,

35:12.640 --> 35:15.400
slow death by judicial murder.

35:16.440 --> 35:18.519
It's not too late to repent.

35:18.520 --> 35:21.879
I'm chapel, see. Don't set
much store by confession.

35:21.880 --> 35:25.560
But you believe in God
and the power of his forgiveness.

35:26.680 --> 35:29.359
End this atrocity now, Stephen.

35:29.360 --> 35:30.960
Save your soul.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.760
Forgive me my sins.

36:01.680 --> 36:05.359
I want it absolutely understood
that I've never forgiven myself

36:05.360 --> 36:08.239
for what I did,
not only to Bert Evans,

36:08.240 --> 36:11.760
but his wife
and their poor little boy.

36:12.840 --> 36:14.360
Albert Evans had a son?

36:16.200 --> 36:18.639
Can you ladies tell me
what the devil you're doing?

36:18.640 --> 36:22.359
There's no time for that, Inspector.
We know who sent those anonymous letters.

36:22.360 --> 36:26.039
Anonymous letters? Received by
Judith Bunyon and Vera Thimble

36:26.040 --> 36:28.759
I don't know of any such letters.

36:28.760 --> 36:32.839
Sure you do. Vera Thimble's
was found in her handbag

36:32.840 --> 36:36.879
and we handed in
Judith Bunyon's to...

36:36.880 --> 36:38.920
Constable Pugh!

36:43.560 --> 36:46.400
When this transfer came up,
it was a sign.

36:49.240 --> 36:53.000
I was sent by God as
his angel of retribution.

36:55.680 --> 36:58.399
There's irony.
Little Stevie Evans...

36:58.400 --> 37:01.159
patrolling the town,
keeping them all safe.

37:01.160 --> 37:05.000
All the while, biding my time
for the right opportunity.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.159
This'll be painless.

37:08.160 --> 37:10.480
An accident on the stairs
in your wheelchair.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.959
There's no-one there to hear you.

37:26.960 --> 37:30.559
I'm looking forward
to all this being over...

37:30.560 --> 37:32.759
popping the question to Gladys...

37:32.760 --> 37:35.079
maybe a kiddie or two.

37:35.080 --> 37:37.039
Is everything all...?

37:37.040 --> 37:40.679
It's all fine. All under control.
Go and fetch help!

37:40.680 --> 37:44.399
We'll have you out of this
in a jiffy, Father.

37:44.400 --> 37:45.840
Go!

37:56.440 --> 37:58.120
I think not.

38:30.480 --> 38:31.960
I'm sorry, Gladys.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.559
Bonkers, in my humble opinion.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.360
Let's hope the judge thinks so.

38:48.040 --> 38:49.680
I owe you a debt of gratitude.

38:50.960 --> 38:53.359
I hear you've got a handy right-hook.

38:53.360 --> 38:57.079
County-flyweight champion,
Cambridge Half Blue...

38:57.080 --> 38:59.079
I gave it up when I entered
the seminary.

38:59.080 --> 39:03.199
I'd forgotten how good it felt.
I thought you were in church
all night. What happened?

39:03.200 --> 39:06.440
And more to the point, how did
you know that he was downstairs?

39:08.640 --> 39:11.720
All right. I'll go and see
where her ladyship's got to.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.799
Listen...

39:16.800 --> 39:18.320
thank you.

39:26.120 --> 39:29.119
It seems you know my weaknesses
better than I do myself.

39:29.120 --> 39:31.959
I couldn't help
but hear the phone ring,

39:31.960 --> 39:34.760
every Sunday at eight,
just before Sunday half-hour.

39:36.080 --> 39:37.600
What's her name?

39:45.480 --> 39:46.800
Louisa.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.840
A woman of such purity and beauty,
I was lost the first time I saw her.

39:54.480 --> 39:58.679
She sent me away, said she couldn't
steal me from God, but...

39:58.680 --> 40:00.919
by then, I was already taken.

40:00.920 --> 40:03.239
And yet you still
corresponded with her?

40:03.240 --> 40:06.639
No an impure word or thought.

40:06.640 --> 40:09.039
I broke no vow,

40:09.040 --> 40:10.880
committed no sin...

40:12.800 --> 40:15.359
except in my heart.

40:15.360 --> 40:18.479
God will understand. Too well.

40:18.480 --> 40:21.840
Too well. He sent me here
to test me...

40:22.960 --> 40:25.359
and the devil was waiting,
tempting,

40:25.360 --> 40:27.520
taunting me with carnal images.

40:31.120 --> 40:34.960
You think that film
was a coincidence?

40:36.240 --> 40:37.640
A sign?

40:39.440 --> 40:40.680
Saying what exactly?

40:42.280 --> 40:44.079
That God wants sacrifice

40:44.080 --> 40:45.719
but not suffering,

40:45.720 --> 40:47.839
that you can still serve him

40:47.840 --> 40:49.360
with the woman you love...

40:50.880 --> 40:53.399
that God has chosen for you...

40:53.400 --> 40:55.040
by your side.

40:58.360 --> 41:02.120
A cup of tea, I think, is in order.
Oh, I'll make it.

41:03.560 --> 41:07.879
Mrs McCarthy, I am perfectly capable
of making a cup of tea.

41:07.880 --> 41:09.759
No doubt you are.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.560
And... I'm...

41:12.600 --> 41:17.879
I'm sorry I said that you
were decorative. Thank you.

41:17.880 --> 41:20.199
And I'm sorry about the scones...

41:20.200 --> 41:22.199
because...

41:22.200 --> 41:24.999
I didn't actually taste them.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.999
You didn't taste my scones?
I just sort of pretended.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.719
You didn't taste my scones?!

41:31.720 --> 41:33.799
Naturally, if I had,
you would have won

41:33.800 --> 41:36.319
which is why I've decided
to come clean and have

41:36.320 --> 41:40.280
the whole competition declared
null and void, however humiliating.

41:41.360 --> 41:42.920
That won't be necessary.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.519
I know the truth

41:46.520 --> 41:48.480
and that's what matters.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.879
You know what, Mrs M?

41:53.880 --> 41:56.039
Underneath it all,

41:56.040 --> 41:57.680
you're a jolly good egg.

41:58.960 --> 42:00.560
Underneath what exactly?

42:02.400 --> 42:04.119
I come to make my goodbyes.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.959
Is something wrong, Father?

42:06.960 --> 42:08.839
On the contrary.

42:08.840 --> 42:12.879
I was lost and now am found,
thanks to Father Brown.

42:12.880 --> 42:15.239
A man of hidden wisdom,
it transpires.

42:15.240 --> 42:18.199
I shall be sure to tell the Bishop
as much, when I inform him.

42:18.200 --> 42:19.920
Inform him of what?

42:23.720 --> 42:25.480
I'm leaving the priesthood.

43:00.240 --> 43:02.080
God be with you.
