IN NEW YORK CITY'S
WAR ON CRIME,

00:09.200 --> 00:11.667
THE WORST CRIMINAL OFFENDERS
ARE PURSUED

00:11.667 --> 00:14.367
BY THE DETECTIVES
OF THE MAJOR CASE SQUAD.

00:14.367 --> 00:16.667
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:18.767 --> 00:23.434
[overlapping dialogue]

00:23.434 --> 00:26.300
[women screaming]

00:31.601 --> 00:34.767
[screaming continues]

00:39.334 --> 00:41.901
>> HIM.
HE'S EVERYWHERE.

00:41.901 --> 00:44.767
>> DON'T LET IT RUIN OUR NIGHT.

00:44.767 --> 00:46.467
>> NO, NO.

00:46.467 --> 00:49.467
I'M FINE.

00:52.033 --> 00:55.033
[electronic dance music]

00:55.033 --> 00:58.834
* *

00:58.834 --> 01:01.000
>> BITCHES CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.400
[laughs smugly]

01:02.400 --> 01:04.167
PAGE SIX
WILL HAVE US RECONCILED

01:04.167 --> 01:07.300
AND ME PREGNANT
BY THE MORNING.

01:07.300 --> 01:09.567
>> LET'S TRY FOR IT.
>> [laughs]

01:20.400 --> 01:23.000
DIDN'T TAKE LONG.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.934
>> AT LEAST HE'S CONSISTENT.

01:25.934 --> 01:27.434
>> AMY, COME ON.

01:29.100 --> 01:30.434
>> OW!

01:30.434 --> 01:32.000
>> LEAN ON ME.
WE'LL GO THROUGH THE KITCHEN.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.868
>> NO, I'M NOT SNEAKING OUT,
I CAN HIDE IT.

01:49.868 --> 01:51.734
>> UH!

01:51.734 --> 01:54.367
[both panting]

01:54.367 --> 01:57.300
WHAT IS THIS,
THE THIRD TIME WE'VE HOOKED UP?

01:57.300 --> 02:01.200
WHEN DO I GET TO KNOW
WHO YOU ARE?

02:01.200 --> 02:05.133
>> I'M PLEASURE.

02:05.133 --> 02:08.400
>> WHAT AM I GETTING MYSELF
INTO HERE?

02:08.400 --> 02:12.100
>> SCARED?

02:15.167 --> 02:20.167
>> YOU HAVE DRAINED ME
OF ALL OF MY FREE WILL.

02:20.167 --> 02:24.667
crowd: NO DEMOLITION!
NO DEMOLITION!

02:24.667 --> 02:25.901
NO DEMOLITION!

02:25.901 --> 02:28.567
>> LET'S GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

02:28.567 --> 02:32.400
crowd: NO DEMOLITION!
NO DEMOLITION!

02:32.400 --> 02:34.167
THE KRILL'S OUT EARLY TODAY.

02:34.167 --> 02:35.968
>> YEAH, IN A WEEK.
THESE IDIOTS ARE HISTORY.

02:35.968 --> 02:38.901
crowd: NO DEMOLITION!
NO DEMOLITION!

02:38.901 --> 02:42.634
NO DEMOLITION!
NO DEMOLITION!

02:42.634 --> 02:44.968
>> ALBERT, MOVE IT!

02:44.968 --> 02:47.701
>> NO DEMOLITION!
NO DEMOLITION!

02:47.701 --> 02:50.601
HAMP.

02:50.601 --> 02:53.567
HAMP, IT'S TERU.

02:53.567 --> 02:56.334
YO DUDE, IT'S 9:30.

02:56.334 --> 02:58.467
COME ON, MAN, GET UP.

02:58.467 --> 03:01.067
TIME TO WORK THOSE MONEYMAKERS.

03:01.067 --> 03:02.968
DUDE, YOUR BILLBOARDS
ARE EVERYWHERE, MAN,

03:02.968 --> 03:05.300
EVEN PHILLY.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.200
MY MOM CALLED THIS MORNING,
AND--

03:07.200 --> 03:10.000
OH, MY GOD.

04:03.767 --> 04:05.934
>> I SHOW UP WITH COFFEE,
SAME TIME EVERY DAY.

04:05.934 --> 04:09.767
HAMP LOVED TO WORK OUT,
EVEN IF HE HADN'T SLEPT.

04:09.767 --> 04:11.834
HE LOVED HIS PILATES.

04:11.834 --> 04:13.834
HE'D HURT HIS BACK
DOING WEIGHTS.

04:13.834 --> 04:15.601
IT WAS, UM, HIS COLOR.

04:15.601 --> 04:17.200
THAT'S HOW I KNEW.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.733
>> HE WAS DEAD.

04:18.733 --> 04:21.033
>> YEAH. I CALLED 911
AND THEY GOT HERE IN MINUTES.

04:21.033 --> 04:23.300
OH, MY GOD.

04:23.300 --> 04:25.667
IT WAS LESS THAN TWO HOURS AGO
THAT I WALKED IN,

04:25.667 --> 04:27.100
THINKING HE WAS ALIVE.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.000
>> OH, HEY.
UH, NO DRUGS.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.400
I ALREADY CHECKED.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.767
>> WHEN YOU FOUND
THE DOOR OPEN,

04:31.767 --> 04:34.067
YOU DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING
WAS WRONG?

04:34.067 --> 04:35.334
>> NO, NO.

04:35.334 --> 04:37.601
UH, HAMP BOUGHT THIS BUILDING
NOT TOO LONG AGO.

04:37.601 --> 04:40.200
UM, HE'S GOT OFFICES
ON THE FLOORS BELOW.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.767
PEOPLE, THEY COME AND GO
ALL THE TIME.

04:41.767 --> 04:43.634
>> WHAT KIND OF OFFICES?

04:43.634 --> 04:45.067
>> HIS FILM PROJECTS.

04:45.067 --> 04:47.934
MUSIC BUSINESS,
CHARITY WORKS.

04:47.934 --> 04:50.601
>> ANY THOUGHTS ON
HIS CAUSE OF DEATH?

04:50.601 --> 04:52.501
>> WELL, BARRING
A MEDICAL ANOMALY,

04:52.501 --> 04:54.434
I GUESS IT'S AN OVERDOSE.

04:54.434 --> 04:55.701
>> I GUESS YOU--

04:55.701 --> 04:58.434
YOU NOTICED THE PETECHIAL
HEMORRHAGING THERE.

04:58.434 --> 05:00.801
>> SUFFOCATION COULD HAVE
RESULTED FROM

05:00.801 --> 05:02.667
A REFLUX CAUSED
BY THE DRUG INGESTION.

05:02.667 --> 05:05.901
>> WELL, I DIDN'T SMELL VOMIT.

05:05.901 --> 05:08.467
>> I'LL HOLD OFF JUDGMENT
UNTIL AFTER I CRACK HIS CHEST.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.367
>> THIS IS MEMORY FOAM.

05:13.367 --> 05:15.534
>> THE PILATES INSTRUCTOR
MENTIONED HE HAD A BAD BACK.

05:15.534 --> 05:18.934
>> DO YOU NOTICE
THE BIG INDENTATIONS THERE?

05:18.934 --> 05:21.400
MAYBE MADE FROM THE KNEES,
AND SMALLER ONES HERE, SEE?

05:21.400 --> 05:23.601
>> SO HE WASN'T ALONE,
AND APPARENTLY,

05:23.601 --> 05:25.167
HE WAS LIVING UP
TO HIS REPUTATION.

05:25.167 --> 05:27.501
WE'LL BAG EVERYTHING
FOR SEMEN AND FLUIDS.

05:27.501 --> 05:31.667
CAN YOU LIGHT THAT INDENTATION
ON THE PILLOW?

05:31.667 --> 05:33.701
>> WELL, THAT'S NO SHROUD
OF TURIN, BUT--

05:33.701 --> 05:35.501
>> IT'S DEFINITELY HIS FACE.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.701
SO EITHER HE SLEPT FACE DOWN,

05:37.701 --> 05:39.200
OR SOMEONE PUSHED HIM
INTO THE PILLOW.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.334
>> MAYBE FORCED HIM DOWN
HARD ENOUGH...

05:42.334 --> 05:44.467
TO SUFFOCATE HIM.

05:55.734 --> 05:59.868
YOU, UH--
MAYBE FINISH YOUR COFFEE?

05:59.868 --> 06:01.067
>> THANK YOU.

06:01.067 --> 06:04.234
>> IT WAS HOT WHEN
YOU ARRIVED HERE?

06:04.234 --> 06:07.067
>> YEAH, UH, I NEVER BRING HAMP
COLD COFFEE.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.968
>> JUST SEEMS TO BE
ROOM TEMPERATURE NOW.

06:14.534 --> 06:16.267
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

06:16.267 --> 06:20.701
>> IT'S BEEN MORE THAN TWO HOURS
SINCE I GOT HERE.

06:20.701 --> 06:23.901
>> YEAH?
MAYBE FOUR HOURS AGO?

06:23.901 --> 06:25.367
>> SO BEFORE YOU CALLED 911--

06:25.367 --> 06:29.901
>> I CALLED AMY,
HIS EX-WIFE.

06:29.901 --> 06:32.033
I DIDN'T WANT HER TO SEE IT
ON THE NEWS.

06:32.033 --> 06:34.968
>> AND THEN AMY CLEANED OUT
THE DRUGS.

06:34.968 --> 06:37.300
>> YEAH.
YEAH.

06:37.300 --> 06:40.234
[overlapping chatter, siren]

06:45.367 --> 06:48.200
>> I DID IT TO PROTECT HIM
FROM A FEEDING FRENZY.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.601
>> DO YOU HAVE TO DO THIS NOW?

06:49.601 --> 06:51.467
SHE'S JUST LOST HER HUSBAND.

06:51.467 --> 06:53.934
>> HUSBAND?
WASN'T THERE A BITTER DIVORCE?

06:53.934 --> 06:55.300
>> I LOVED HAMP.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.901
WE WERE TRYING
FOR RECONCILIATION.

06:56.901 --> 06:59.834
>> WHY DID HAMP
LIVE AT HIS LOFT?

06:59.834 --> 07:02.234
>> THEY WERE GIVING EACH OTHER
SOME SPACE.

07:02.234 --> 07:04.434
>> I SEE YOU PLAYED VENEFICA.

07:04.434 --> 07:05.968
>> YOU PRONOUNCED IT RIGHT.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.300
PRODUCERS WANTED TO CHANGE IT.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.734
>> HUH?

07:08.734 --> 07:12.200
>> ANCIENT ROMAN WOMEN
THAT WERE SORCERESSES,

07:12.200 --> 07:14.734
THEY KILLED MEN
BY THE ACT OF LOVE.

07:14.734 --> 07:17.367
>> IF THE AUDIENCE HAS
YOUR ERUDITION,

07:17.367 --> 07:19.133
I'LL HAVE A HIT.

07:19.133 --> 07:20.934
>> THIS ONE HERE,
YOU'RE AN OLYMPIC SKIER.

07:20.934 --> 07:22.100
WHEN WAS THAT?

07:22.100 --> 07:25.334
>> <i>EXTREME MEASURES,</i> UM...

07:25.334 --> 07:26.801
THREE YEARS AGO?

07:26.801 --> 07:29.968
>> OH, THAT'S AROUND THE SAME
TIME YOU SPLIT WITH HAMP.

07:29.968 --> 07:31.434
>> YES.

07:31.434 --> 07:33.534
BUT OUR FEELINGS
WERE VERY STRONG.

07:33.534 --> 07:36.033
WE WANTED IT TO WORK.

07:36.033 --> 07:37.834
>> THE NEWS SAID
YOU LEFT THE CLUB EARLY.

07:37.834 --> 07:39.868
YOU WEREN'T HAVING FUN?

07:39.868 --> 07:43.200
>> MY HIP WAS BOTHERING ME,
SO I COULDN'T DANCE.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.334
>> YEAH, I NOTICED THAT,

07:44.334 --> 07:46.501
YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE A SLIGHT LIMP.

07:46.501 --> 07:50.534
>> MAKING <i>EXTREME MEASURES,</i>
I...FELL DOING MY OWN STUNTS.

07:50.534 --> 07:52.434
SOMETIMES STRESS
CAUSES IT TO HURT.

07:52.434 --> 07:54.634
>> MM. WHAT WAS STRESSFUL
LAST NIGHT?

07:54.634 --> 07:57.300
>> WHAT'S BETWEEN THEM
IS VERY PERSONAL.

07:57.300 --> 08:00.100
>> SO'S HOMICIDE.
AND I ASKED HER.

08:00.100 --> 08:01.267
>> SOMEONE MURDERED HAMP?

08:01.267 --> 08:04.234
>> WE'RE TRYING
TO DETERMINE THAT.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.667
BUT REMOVING EVIDENCE
DOESN'T HELP US.

08:06.667 --> 08:07.834
IN FACT, IT'S A FELONY.

08:07.834 --> 08:11.868
>> I TOLD YOU
WHY I DID IT.

08:11.868 --> 08:14.701
A MAN THAT I LOVED IS DEAD.

08:14.701 --> 08:16.801
SO I DON'T HAVE
TO TOLERATE THIS.

08:16.801 --> 08:20.033
IT'S ENOUGH.

08:20.033 --> 08:23.601
>> THE COLOR OF PASSION,
THAT'S YOU, BABY.

08:23.601 --> 08:27.667
>> WITH HER HAIR
AND COMPLEXION, FABULOUS.

08:27.667 --> 08:31.234
>> YOU'RE SWEET.

08:31.234 --> 08:32.467
>> POLICE.

08:32.467 --> 08:35.033
>> FORMERLY.
I'M NOW IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

08:35.033 --> 08:38.767
>> I AM SO CURIOUS ABOUT
HAMP TROTTER.

08:38.767 --> 08:40.267
THERE'S A RUMOR
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MURDERED.

08:40.267 --> 08:41.433
>> YEAH, I DON'T--

08:41.433 --> 08:42.801
>> SUCH A GREAT GUY.

08:42.801 --> 08:44.834
HE CAME IN HERE
A NUMBER OF TIMES.

08:44.834 --> 08:46.767
WHAT A SHAME.

08:46.767 --> 08:48.133
HE WOULD COME
WITH ALL THESE WOMEN.

08:48.133 --> 08:49.501
>> HUH.

08:49.501 --> 08:51.501
>> REAL TRAGEDY.
>> MM-HMM.

08:51.501 --> 08:54.234
>> YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
THE GIFTS HE BUYS FOR WOMEN.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.634
OR HE USED TO, RATHER.
>> RIGHT.

08:55.634 --> 08:58.667
>> WHAT A GREAT GUY.
>> CAN YOU JUST--

08:58.667 --> 09:00.334
JUST...HOLD ON.

09:00.334 --> 09:02.868
GALLA! GALLA!

09:02.868 --> 09:06.234
SO THERE'S TALK, BABY.
YOU CAN'T LET IT GET TO YOU.

09:06.234 --> 09:08.767
>> IT'S NOT WHAT I WANTED,
STASH.

09:08.767 --> 09:11.133
>> STUFF HAPPENS.

09:11.133 --> 09:13.300
THE EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAD,

09:13.300 --> 09:15.501
IT'S NOT WHERE THEY CAN FIND IT,
YOU KNOW WHY?

09:15.501 --> 09:17.200
BECAUSE I'M LOOKING OUT
FOR YOU.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.534
I HOPE YOU CAN
APPRECIATE THAT.

09:19.534 --> 09:22.567
YEAH? GOOD.

09:22.567 --> 09:24.100
'CAUSE WHEN I LOOK ACROSS
THAT TABLE,

09:24.100 --> 09:28.667
I WANNA SEE YOU WEARING
THOSE LITTLE RUBIES.

09:28.667 --> 09:30.434
[growls playfully]

09:30.434 --> 09:34.200
WE'LL BE BACK.
COME ON.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.033
>> IT'S STILL NOT OFFICIALLY
A HOMICIDE,

09:36.033 --> 09:38.234
BUT I HAD TO PUT ON EXTRA PEOPLE
TO HANDLE THE CALLS.

09:38.234 --> 09:40.968
>> WE RAN A PAPARAZZI BLOCKADE
AT AMY'S APARTMENT.

09:40.968 --> 09:43.300
>> RELATIVE TO THAT,
HER MANAGER CALLED

09:43.300 --> 09:44.701
COMPLAINING THAT MY DETECTIVES

09:44.701 --> 09:46.534
WERE AGGRESSIVE
WITH A GRIEVING WIDOW.

09:46.534 --> 09:49.234
>> DOES WIDOW APPLY
IF THEY WERE DIVORCED?

09:49.234 --> 09:51.367
>> I THINK THEY STARTED RUMORS
OF RECONCILIATION

09:51.367 --> 09:53.667
TO PROMOTE HER NEW FILM.

09:53.667 --> 09:55.534
>> THREE YEARS AGO,
SHE WAS A RISING STAR,

09:55.534 --> 09:58.634
HE WAS THE UNKNOWN MALE MODEL
WHO MARRIED HER.

09:58.634 --> 10:00.434
AMAZING HOW A SET OF ABS
AND SOME LUCK

10:00.434 --> 10:01.734
CAN TURN THINGS AROUND.

10:01.734 --> 10:04.501
>> I WOULD IMAGINE SOME ENEMIES
COME WITH SUDDEN FAME.

10:04.501 --> 10:06.968
WHO DID HAMP CLIMB OVER
ON HIS WAY TO THE TOP?

10:06.968 --> 10:10.000
>> YOU KNOW, HAMP ACTUALLY
HAD A REPUTATION FOR BEING A--

10:10.000 --> 10:12.267
A DECENT GUY.

10:12.267 --> 10:15.000
HE WAS GENEROUS,
HE EMBRACED GOOD CAUSES.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
>> HE ALSO EMBRACED ANY WOMAN
WHO GOT CLOSE ENOUGH

10:17.000 --> 10:18.300
FOR A SMELL TEST.

10:18.300 --> 10:19.667
OPENS SOME DOORS FOR MOTIVE.

10:19.667 --> 10:21.901
>> WE'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

10:21.901 --> 10:24.334
>> WE'VE ALREADY HAD
SECURITY ISSUES.

10:24.334 --> 10:26.501
CAUGHT ONE OF OUR TRANSFER
PEOPLE TRYING TO TAKE PHOTOS

10:26.501 --> 10:28.434
OF THAT WHICH MADE HIM
LEGENDARY.

10:28.434 --> 10:32.000
>> THEY COULD DEFINITELY IGNITE
A BIDDING FRENZY ON eBAY.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.934
>> VERY TASTEFULLY STATED,
CAPTAIN.

10:34.934 --> 10:37.234
NOW, CAUSE OF DEATH.

10:37.234 --> 10:38.734
DETECTIVE GOREN ONCE AGAIN

10:38.734 --> 10:40.267
HAS AN IRRITATING WAY
OF BEING RIGHT.

10:40.267 --> 10:41.901
>> HE SUFFOCATED.

10:41.901 --> 10:45.400
>> NO INTERNAL BRUISING ON HIS
THROAT, NO LIGATURE MARKS,

10:45.400 --> 10:48.534
BUT FINGERTIP BRUISES
ON HIS NECK AND LOWER SCALP

10:48.534 --> 10:49.868
WITHIN THE HAIRLINE.

10:49.868 --> 10:51.601
>> HIS FACE WAS FORCED
INTO THE PILLOW.

10:51.601 --> 10:53.234
>> HE'S A BIG STRONG GUY.

10:53.234 --> 10:54.467
THERE WERE NO SIGNS
OF A STRUGGLE.

10:54.467 --> 10:56.067
>> WELL, WITH WHAT HE HAD
IN HIS SYSTEM,

10:56.067 --> 10:59.567
HE COULD BEST BE DESCRIBED
AS TOTALLY MALLEABLE.

10:59.567 --> 11:01.734
SINUSES HAD RESIDUE OF COCAINE

11:01.734 --> 11:04.501
AND SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS
OF OXYCONTIN.

11:04.501 --> 11:06.767
>> WELL, OXYCONTIN IS
A TIME RELEASE PILL

11:06.767 --> 11:08.400
AND IT'S GROUND AND INHALED.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.133
IT HAS AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT.

11:10.133 --> 11:13.200
>> MM-HMM.
SOMNOLENCE, BRADYCHARDIA.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.501
DRUG ALONE COULD HAVE
KILLED HIM.

11:14.501 --> 11:17.067
>> IT'S USUALLY USED FOR
LONG-TERM PAIN MANAGEMENT.

11:17.067 --> 11:20.467
>> SO IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A WOMAN WITH A LIMP.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.601
>> I SEE YOUR HIP
MUST BE FEELING BETTER.

11:31.601 --> 11:33.501
YOU'RE NOT LIMPING.

11:33.501 --> 11:37.200
>> YEAH. IT'S FINE.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.367
>> I'M CURIOUS.

11:38.367 --> 11:42.367
WHAT MEDICATIONS DO YOU USE
FOR THE PAIN?

11:42.367 --> 11:45.534
>> UH, WITHOUT IMMUNITY,
MY CLIENT WON'T RESPOND TO THAT.

11:45.534 --> 11:47.767
>> WELL, I DON'T THINK
IMMUNITY'S IN HER BEST INTEREST.

11:47.767 --> 11:49.767
>> I'LL DECIDE
IF IT'S HER BEST INTEREST.

11:49.767 --> 11:52.167
SHE'S NOT RISKING A, UH,
NARCOTICS CHARGE.

11:52.167 --> 11:53.367
>> SHE'LL BE RISKING
MORE THAN THAT

11:53.367 --> 11:55.901
IF WORD OF IMMUNITY
GETS TO THE TABLOIDS.

11:55.901 --> 11:58.601
>> THE MEDIA WILL TRY HER
FOR HAMP'S MURDER.

11:58.601 --> 12:00.868
>> WAIT, YOU DON'T THINK
THAT I KILLED HAMP.

12:00.868 --> 12:04.901
>> YOU WENT TO HIS LOFT
AND REMOVED EVIDENCE.

12:04.901 --> 12:06.534
THAT'S AN ODD REACTION

12:06.534 --> 12:08.801
WHEN YOU HEAR SOMEBODY
YOU SUPPOSEDLY LOVE IS DEAD.

12:08.801 --> 12:11.267
>> WELL, I ALSO CRIED.

12:11.267 --> 12:13.067
IT TORE MY HEART OUT
TO SEE HIM LIKE THAT.

12:13.067 --> 12:15.367
I NEVER WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM.
I LOVED HIM.

12:15.367 --> 12:18.434
>> WE HEAR THAT
EVERY DAY, AMY.

12:18.434 --> 12:20.501
>> IF I HAD KILLED HAMP,

12:20.501 --> 12:22.100
I WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE DRUGS
AT THE TIME.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.934
THERE'S NO WAY
I WOULD HAVE GONE BACK.

12:23.934 --> 12:25.868
>> THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

12:25.868 --> 12:27.133
>> YEAH WELL,
I'VE PLAYED A MURDERESS.

12:27.133 --> 12:28.367
I KNOW HOW THEY THINK.

12:28.367 --> 12:31.801
>> RIGHT.
[chuckles]

12:31.801 --> 12:35.000
WE'RE NOT AFTER, UH,
NARCOTICS CHARGES HERE.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.434
WE'RE JUST--

12:36.434 --> 12:37.734
WE JUST WANT TO KNOW

12:37.734 --> 12:41.767
IF OXYCONTIN WAS ONE
OF THE DRUGS YOU REMOVED.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
>> YEAH, ALONG WITH COKE
AND SOME HASH.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.767
THE OXY BOTTLE
WAS MY PRESCRIPTION.

12:52.767 --> 12:55.400
I GAVE IT TO HAMP
ALONG WITH THE LECTURE.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.334
I THINK HE HEARD ME.

12:57.334 --> 12:58.968
>> WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

12:58.968 --> 13:00.868
>> WELL, THE BOTTLE
HAD ITS FULL PILL COUNT.

13:00.868 --> 13:02.000
IF HE OVERDOSED ON OXY,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.868
IT WAS SOMEONE ELSE
THAT GAVE IT TO HIM.

13:04.868 --> 13:07.000
>> YOUR HIP BEGAN HURTING YOU
AT THE PARTY.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
WHAT CAUSED THAT?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.667
>> I HAD SEEN HER BEFORE
AT PASTICHE.

13:11.667 --> 13:12.968
SHE WAS WITH HAMP.

13:12.968 --> 13:17.634
I...KNEW HE HAD HER,
AND THAT HE WANTED HER AGAIN.

13:17.634 --> 13:20.968
SO IT WAS TIME
TO LIMP ON HOME.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.133
>> WHO IS SHE?

13:23.133 --> 13:27.501
>> DARK HAIR, BEAUTIFUL...

13:27.501 --> 13:29.234
THEY'RE ALWAYS BEAUTIFUL.

13:29.234 --> 13:33.033
>> ONE NOTICES DETAILS
ABOUT THE OTHER WOMAN.

13:33.033 --> 13:36.100
CLOTHES, HAIRSTYLE...

13:36.100 --> 13:38.534
>> BLACK DRESS
TO ACCENTUATE WHITE SKIN

13:38.534 --> 13:41.434
AND A...GREAT BODY.

13:41.434 --> 13:43.968
SHE HAD...CANARY DIAMONDS.

13:43.968 --> 13:47.234
YOU KNOW, AT PASTICHE,
SHE WAS WEARING EMERALD STUDS.

13:47.234 --> 13:49.667
AN EARRING WHORE.

13:49.667 --> 13:53.334
>> BEAUTIFUL, BIG DIAMONDS,
AND HOT FOR THE HAMP?

13:53.334 --> 13:56.534
AT THAT PARTY, THE ONLY WOMAN
NOT COMING ONTO HIM

13:56.534 --> 13:57.734
WAS THAT CORNER BED.

13:57.734 --> 13:59.300
ALL LESBIANS.

13:59.300 --> 14:00.934
>> YOU TALK LIKE YOU KNEW HIM.

14:00.934 --> 14:02.701
>> SINCE BACK WHEN
AMY PAID HIS BAR BILLS.

14:02.701 --> 14:05.501
HE DIDN'T COME HERE FOR A WHILE
AFTER THE THING WITH THE DUKE.

14:05.501 --> 14:07.067
>> DUKE DEGUERIN?

14:07.067 --> 14:08.868
>> YOU DON'T READ PAGE SIX.

14:08.868 --> 14:10.834
THEY NEARLY HAD A PUNCH UP.

14:10.834 --> 14:12.434
I ESCORTED HAMP OUT.

14:12.434 --> 14:14.534
>> WHAT STARTED THE FIGHT?

14:14.534 --> 14:16.367
>> I DON'T KNOW.

14:16.367 --> 14:18.167
I SAW TOMMY MORGAN
TALKING WITH THE DUKE.

14:18.167 --> 14:19.667
HE MIGHT KNOW.

14:19.667 --> 14:20.968
WHATEVER IT WAS,
HE SETTLED IT DOWN.

14:20.968 --> 14:22.467
>> TOMMY MORGAN.

14:22.467 --> 14:23.834
>> THEATER DIRECTOR.

14:23.834 --> 14:26.300
HE AND HAMP WERE TIGHT.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.501
>> I'M IN SHOCK.
YOU KNOW?

14:28.501 --> 14:30.934
THE GUY HAD IT ALL.
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

14:30.934 --> 14:32.367
>> YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME
WITH HIM.

14:32.367 --> 14:34.033
>> YEAH.

14:34.033 --> 14:35.501
HAMP LOVED SHARING THE WEALTH,
YOU KNOW?

14:35.501 --> 14:38.000
HE'D TAKE US ALL TO ICELAND
FOR SOME WILD PARTY

14:38.000 --> 14:40.601
ON A COLOGNE COMPANY JET.

14:40.601 --> 14:43.367
>> YOU WERE WITH HIM
AT LAXOS WHEN HE GOT IN A FIGHT

14:43.367 --> 14:45.033
WITH DUKE DEGUERIN?

14:45.033 --> 14:46.200
>> THE <i>POST</i> CALLED IT A FIGHT.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.667
IT WAS MORE LIKE
A SHOVING MATCH.

14:47.667 --> 14:49.167
HAMP WASN'T A FIGHTER.

14:49.167 --> 14:50.534
>> WHAT STARTED IT?

14:50.534 --> 14:54.200
>> I THINK IT GOES BACK
TO THAT BIKE RACE IN THE PARK.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.901
WE'RE GETTING READY TO RIDE,
AND DUKE DEGUERIN,

14:56.901 --> 14:59.267
HE COMES WALKING UP
WEARING LYCRA SHORTS

14:59.267 --> 15:00.601
AND A LYCRA T-SHIRT.

15:00.601 --> 15:03.767
AND--AND SOME PEOPLE
SHOULDN'T BE WEARING LYCRA,

15:03.767 --> 15:05.167
AND HAMP LOVED BUSTING BALLS.

15:05.167 --> 15:07.734
SO HE YELLS, "HEY. HEY,
REMIND ME TO NEVER GET OLD."

15:07.734 --> 15:10.100
AND DEGUERIN WENT BALLISTIC.

15:10.100 --> 15:12.901
I MEAN, HIS WIFE AND SECURITY
PEOPLE HAD TO HOLD HIM BACK.

15:12.901 --> 15:14.467
>> AND THEN HAMP SAW HIM AGAIN
AT LAXOS.

15:14.467 --> 15:15.868
>> YEAH.

15:15.868 --> 15:19.601
DEGUERIN CLAIMED THAT HAMP
MADE SOME REMARK TO HIS WIFE.

15:19.601 --> 15:22.734
HE SWUNG, HAMP SHOVED,
AND THEN IT WAS OVER.

15:22.734 --> 15:24.067
I TOLD HAMP HE WAS LUCKY.

15:24.067 --> 15:25.701
>> WHY LUCKY?

15:25.701 --> 15:27.501
>> THIS ACTOR I WORKED WITH,

15:27.501 --> 15:29.667
HE WAS AT DUKE DEGUERIN'S TABLE
ONE NIGHT.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.367
ALL THESE WOMEN WERE WALKING UP
TO HIM SAYING,

15:31.367 --> 15:34.100
"HEY, GREAT TEETH,
BEAUTIFUL SMILE."

15:34.100 --> 15:36.467
LATER THAT NIGHT,
THIS GUY GETS JUMPED.

15:36.467 --> 15:40.634
HE DOESN'T GET ROBBED,
JUST, YOU KNOW?

15:40.634 --> 15:44.234
NO MORE BEAUTIFUL SMILE.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
>> ALEX. HOW ARE YOU DOING?
>> HEY, STASH.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.701
[laughs] STASH BARDEM,
MY PARTNER ROBERT GOREN.

15:58.701 --> 16:00.968
STASH AND I USED TO WORK
OUT OF THE ONE NINE.

16:00.968 --> 16:02.834
>> YEAH, YEAH. I TAUGHT HER
EVERYTHING SHE KNOWS.

16:02.834 --> 16:05.934
SO SHE MOVES TO MAJOR CASE,
MY ARTERIES GET CLOGGED IN VICE.

16:05.934 --> 16:08.000
>> OH, AS I RECALL,
YOU LOVED IT.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.667
>> AH WELL,
EVERYTHING GETS OLD.

16:09.667 --> 16:10.934
SO, I'M OUT.

16:10.934 --> 16:13.200
I'M HEADING UP SECURITY
FOR DUKE DEGUERIN.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.434
SHE'S THE BEST, ROBERT.
THE BEST.

16:16.434 --> 16:20.133
>> YEAH, SURE I REMEMBER.
FILLED TABLOIDS FOR A WEEK.

16:20.133 --> 16:21.467
>> WHAT STARTED IT?

16:21.467 --> 16:24.100
>> HIS PROFANITY WITHIN EARSHOT
OF MY WIFE.

16:24.100 --> 16:25.901
I ASKED HIM TO KNOCK IT OFF,
HE DIDN'T,

16:25.901 --> 16:28.033
SO WE CROSSED SWORDS.

16:28.033 --> 16:29.434
>> YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE?

16:29.434 --> 16:33.434
>> [scoffs]
ONLY IF I LOOK OUT HERE.

16:33.434 --> 16:37.200
HE ESPOUSES CONCERN
FOR THE BEAUTY OF OUR CITY.

16:37.200 --> 16:41.901
THEN SPREADS PORNOGRAPHY
WITH THOSE BILLBOARDS.

16:41.901 --> 16:45.300
OKAY.
ENOUGH ILL OF THE DEAD.

16:45.300 --> 16:49.534
>> SO, IS THIS ARENA
NOW GONNA MOVE AHEAD?

16:49.534 --> 16:52.367
>> AT TODAY'S MEMORIAL SERVICE,
PROTESTERS WILL PRAISE HAMP

16:52.367 --> 16:53.968
AND BEAT UP ON ME.

16:53.968 --> 16:57.834
SO NOW IS PROBABLY NOT
THE TIME.

16:57.834 --> 17:00.267
>> "NO ONE DOES IT
LIKE THE DUKE."

17:00.267 --> 17:02.334
IT'S HAMP'S WIFE.

17:02.334 --> 17:04.267
YOU TWO EVER CROSS SWORDS
OVER THIS?

17:04.267 --> 17:07.032
>> YEAH, FRIENDS SAID,
"LET'S PUT MONEY IN THE FILM

17:07.032 --> 17:09.501
SO WE CAN PARTY AT SUNDANCE."

17:09.501 --> 17:11.032
SHE JUST HAPPENED
TO BE IN IT.

17:11.032 --> 17:12.867
I HAVE NO REAL INTEREST
IN FILMS.

17:12.867 --> 17:16.367
>> AS OPPOSED TO DEVELOPING
THE ISLE OF MULL?

17:16.367 --> 17:18.867
>> NO, NOT MULL.
BUT CLOSE.

17:18.867 --> 17:21.233
THE ISLE OF ISLAY.

17:21.233 --> 17:23.968
>> OH, RIGHT.
ISLAY, YEAH.

17:23.968 --> 17:25.701
WORLD FAMOUS FOR SCOTCH.

17:25.701 --> 17:27.334
>> I BOUGHT THAT DISTILLERY.

17:27.334 --> 17:30.067
>> GLEN KENNEBRAGH.
THE STUFF IS--

17:30.067 --> 17:33.033
THIS IS $1,000 A BOTTLE.

17:33.033 --> 17:34.701
>> $2,000.

17:34.701 --> 17:36.400
BUT, UH, NOW IT'S
MY PRIVATE STOCK.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.334
NO LONGER FOR SALE.

17:38.334 --> 17:41.934
>> HAMP TROTTER'S
ON YOUR CHRISTMAS LIST?

17:41.934 --> 17:45.634
WE, WE FOUND TWO OF THOSE
BOTTLES IN HIS LOFT.

17:45.634 --> 17:49.200
>> WE GIVE 200 BOTTLES A YEAR
TO EMPLOYEES.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.167
MAYBE SOMEONE REGIFTED THEM.

17:51.167 --> 17:53.367
>> AVIA.

17:53.367 --> 17:55.400
MY DARLING WIFE, AVIA.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.734
[chuckles]

17:56.734 --> 17:59.434
THESE ARE DETECTIVES, UM,
GOBLIN AND, UH, SORRY.

17:59.434 --> 18:01.834
>> DETECTIVE GOREN
AND I'M DETECTIVE EAMES.

18:01.834 --> 18:04.133
COULD WE GET A LIST
OF THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVED IT?

18:04.133 --> 18:08.067
>> YES, FIND OUT
WHO REGIFTED MY SCOTCH.

18:08.067 --> 18:11.200
AND THEN I'LL FIRE THEM.

18:15.267 --> 18:16.934
>> THERE'S ALMOST 200 NAMES.

18:16.934 --> 18:19.834
>> WE KNOW WHO GAVE IT
TO HAMP.

18:19.834 --> 18:21.901
>> THE DUKE'S WIFE CHEATS?

18:21.901 --> 18:24.968
THAT WOULD MAKE
THE VISIT WORTHWHILE.

18:24.968 --> 18:29.467
[cell phone rings]

18:29.467 --> 18:33.033
>> DUKE.
HE WANTS TO TALK.

18:33.033 --> 18:35.167
I THINK IT'S ABOUT
THIS CITY CONTROLLER

18:35.167 --> 18:37.100
WHOSE SIGNATURE WE NEED.

18:37.100 --> 18:38.968
>> A CITY CONTROLLER.

18:38.968 --> 18:40.968
>> ALL RIGHT,
A LITTLE REALITY CHECK.

18:40.968 --> 18:43.400
WHAT WE'VE GOT WITH DUKE
IS A GOOD THING.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.767
BE MORE APPRECIATIVE.

18:44.767 --> 18:47.167
>> I DIDN'T SIGN ON
FOR WHAT WAS DONE TO HAMP.

18:47.167 --> 18:50.234
>> AND WE KNOW NOTHING AB--

18:50.234 --> 18:53.200
AND WE KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT THAT.

18:53.200 --> 18:58.100
ENOUGH SAID.

18:58.100 --> 19:01.434
NOW YOU GET WHATEVER FEELINGS
YOU HAVE UNDER CONTROL.

19:01.434 --> 19:02.801
OKAY?

19:02.801 --> 19:06.100
>> TELL DEGUERIN I WANT OUT.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.033
>> FOR YOUR SAKE,

19:14.033 --> 19:15.834
THAT'S THE ONE THING
I'LL NEVER TELL HIM.

19:24.467 --> 19:28.067
ORDER ME A CREME BRULEE.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.834
>> HAMP TROTTER'S LOFT.
I NEED ENTRY.

19:34.834 --> 19:38.467
>> THAT'S A CRIME SCENE.
THAT'S NOT EASY.

19:38.467 --> 19:42.200
>> I SAID, I NEED ENTRY.

19:42.200 --> 19:45.334
>> SURE.

19:51.601 --> 19:55.601
>> DUKE?

20:00.501 --> 20:02.801
I'M READY.

20:06.267 --> 20:08.234
>> FILTH.

20:08.234 --> 20:12.534
>> YES.
I'M FILTH.

20:12.534 --> 20:14.601
>> WHERE'S THE FEAR,
THE SUBMISSION?

20:14.601 --> 20:16.968
I NEED TO SEE THAT.

20:16.968 --> 20:21.234
>> I SWEAR, DUKE.
I'M AFRAID.

20:38.701 --> 20:41.734
>> THE MEMORIAL RALLY FOR HAMP
BY THE PEOPLE TRYING TO SAVE

20:41.734 --> 20:42.901
THE COLONIAL NEIGHBORHOOD.

20:42.901 --> 20:44.467
I THINK WE SHOULD ATTEND.

20:44.467 --> 20:48.133
>> TO HEAR LOCAL CELEBRITIES
EULOGIZE HIM?

20:48.133 --> 20:50.834
>> I'M THINKING SOMEONE SPECIAL
MIGHT SHOW UP.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.901
>> OUR BEAUTIFUL MYSTERY WOMAN.

20:52.901 --> 20:55.200
PROBLEM IS,
HOW WOULD WE KNOW HER?

20:55.200 --> 20:59.467
>> WE TAKE SOMEONE WHO DOES.

20:59.467 --> 21:03.567
>> HAMP KNEW THAT ALEXANDER
HAMILTON WALKED THESE COBBLES.

21:03.567 --> 21:04.834
crowd: YEAH.

21:04.834 --> 21:07.968
>> HE KNEW DR. BENJAMIN RUSH
STAYED WITH HIS COUSINS

21:07.968 --> 21:10.367
IN THIS HOUSE BEHIND ME.
crowd: YEAH.

21:10.367 --> 21:12.400
>> HAMP KNEW THIS
BECAUSE HE LOVED,

21:12.400 --> 21:16.133
AND WANTED TO PRESERVE
WHAT WE LOVE.

21:16.133 --> 21:18.634
crowd: YEAH!

21:18.634 --> 21:19.901
>> GET BACK.

21:19.901 --> 21:21.400
THIS HAS KILLED ANY THOUGHTS
I'VE HAD

21:21.400 --> 21:23.400
ABOUT DOING PERSONAL SECURITY.

21:23.400 --> 21:24.434
>> EASY.

21:24.434 --> 21:25.634
>> NO TO THE DUKE!

21:25.634 --> 21:28.133
all: NO TO THE DUKE!
NO TO THE DUKE!

21:28.133 --> 21:32.167
NO TO THE DUKE!
NO TO THE DUKE!

21:32.167 --> 21:35.334
NO TO THE DUKE!
NO TO THE DUKE!

21:35.334 --> 21:36.868
NO TO THE DUKE!
>> THERE.

21:36.868 --> 21:39.367
NO TO THE DUKE!
NO TO THE DUKE!

21:39.367 --> 21:41.801
>> THAT'S HER.
>> HEY HEY HEY!

21:41.801 --> 21:44.067
>> FILTHY STUPID LITTLE BITCH!

21:44.067 --> 21:45.968
SHE KILLED HAMP!
GET HER!

21:45.968 --> 21:48.234
SHE KILLED HIM!
THIS IS THE ONE--

21:48.234 --> 21:49.667
[overlapping shouting]

21:49.667 --> 21:51.501
>> BREAK IT UP.
>> SHE KILLED HAMP!

21:51.501 --> 21:52.801
>> TAKE HER OUT.
TAKE HER OVER THERE.

21:52.801 --> 21:54.100
>> GET OFF OF ME!

21:54.100 --> 21:56.634
>> LET ME THROUGH.
POLICE! LET ME THROUGH.

21:56.634 --> 21:59.367
crowd: NO TO THE DUKE!
NO TO THE DUKE!

21:59.367 --> 22:02.968
NO TO THE DUKE!
NO TO THE DUKE!

22:02.968 --> 22:03.968
NO TO THE DUKE!

22:03.968 --> 22:05.567
>> MAJOR CASE SQUAD.

22:05.567 --> 22:08.167
THE NAME IMPLIES
COMPETENCE AND JUDGMENT.

22:08.167 --> 22:11.167
IN WHAT UNIVERSE DOES
SERVING AMY TOWNSEND UP

22:11.167 --> 22:13.534
TO THE RAVENOUS MEDIA
FIT INTO EITHER CATEGORY?

22:13.534 --> 22:17.300
>> WELL, SHE SERVED HERSELF UP
FOR PUBLICITY.

22:17.300 --> 22:18.567
>> MORE IMPORTANTLY,

22:18.567 --> 22:20.868
IT GOT US THE IDENTITY
OF A PERSON OF INTEREST.

22:20.868 --> 22:23.167
>> SO TABLOIDS NOW
DO OUR WORK FOR US.

22:23.167 --> 22:25.334
>> GOTTA SAY,
THEY'RE EFFECTIVE.

22:25.334 --> 22:29.501
"GALLINA ILYANOVA RICHTER,
25, BORN IN BRIGHTON BEACH."

22:29.501 --> 22:31.000
>> ALL RIGHT, AN I.D.
WHERE IS SHE?

22:31.000 --> 22:33.100
>> NO CURRENT ADDRESS,
BUT WE'LL FIND HER.

22:33.100 --> 22:34.767
>> SHE'S BEEN IN THE SYSTEM.

22:34.767 --> 22:37.767
SHE WAS BOOKED BUT NEVER
INDICTED FOR FORGERY,

22:37.767 --> 22:40.167
THEFT, PROSTITUTION.
WORKING NAME IS GALLA.

22:40.167 --> 22:43.801
YOU REMEMBER JAMIE WITZGER?

22:43.801 --> 22:45.834
>> KING OF THE HIGH-END
CALL GIRLS,

22:45.834 --> 22:48.334
BILLED HIMSELF
AS GOD'S OWN PIMP?

22:48.334 --> 22:51.434
>> HE'S CURRENTLY IN RIKERS
AWAITING TRIAL

22:51.434 --> 22:53.767
ON OVER A HUNDRED COUNTS
OF PANDERING AND EXTORTION.

22:53.767 --> 22:56.067
>> WELL, GALLA IS ONE OF HIS.

22:56.067 --> 22:59.334
>> LET'S SEE IF JAMIE
STAYS IN TOUCH.

22:59.334 --> 23:02.667
>> I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU.
WAY AHEAD.

23:02.667 --> 23:04.000
YEAH.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.801
GALLA CALLED ME ABOUT
THE SITUATION WITH HAMP.

23:06.801 --> 23:09.300
SHE WAS TERRIFIED.

23:09.300 --> 23:10.467
>> TERRIFIED OF WHAT?

23:10.467 --> 23:11.634
>> WELL, TO START WITH,

23:11.634 --> 23:13.701
SHE FORGOT BUSINESS
IS ALWAYS BUSINESS.

23:13.701 --> 23:15.033
SHE GOT HUNG UP.

23:15.033 --> 23:17.267
>> HUNG UP ON HAMP TROTTER?

23:17.267 --> 23:20.834
>> COME ON.
THING WAS LEGENDARY.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.300
GALLA TOLD ME
IT RIVALS MY OWN.

23:22.300 --> 23:25.400
>> YOU'RE LIVING UP
TO OUR EXPECTATIONS, JAMIE.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.033
>> JUST ROCKIN'
WITH THE TRUTH, BABE.

23:27.033 --> 23:28.400
>> ANYWAY, BACK TO GALLA.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.467
SHE WAS TERRIFIED,
WAS AFRAID OF--

23:30.467 --> 23:33.601
>> THE DEAL WAS, SET UP
HAMP TROTTER FOR A DRUG BUST.

23:33.601 --> 23:35.033
YOU KNOW, JUST SET HIM UP.

23:35.033 --> 23:37.701
>> SET HIM UP FOR WHO?

23:37.701 --> 23:40.934
>> NAMES?
[chuckles]

23:40.934 --> 23:44.367
I'LL TALK EVENTS,
BUT NAMES COULD GET HER KILLED.

23:44.367 --> 23:47.267
GALLA WAS SUPPOSED
TO BANG THE HAMP,

23:47.267 --> 23:51.000
LEAVE HIM STONED IN THE ZONE
WITH A BUNCH OF DRUGS,

23:51.000 --> 23:54.267
AND SOMEONE CALLS THE TABLOIDS,
RUINS HIS CAREER.

23:54.267 --> 23:57.133
INSTEAD, HE ENDS UP DEAD.
GO FIGURE.

23:57.133 --> 24:00.367
>> AND YOU ACTUALLY
BELIEVE THAT.

24:00.367 --> 24:03.701
>> SHE DOESN'T LIE.

24:03.701 --> 24:05.601
>> IF SHE CALLS,
HAVE HER GET IN TOUCH

24:05.601 --> 24:11.400
BEFORE SHE'S GRABBED UP
ON MURDER CHARGES.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.267
>> SHE MOURNS HIM PUBLICLY,
CAT FIGHTS WITH HIS EX.

24:14.267 --> 24:16.167
THAT'S NOT GOOD, STASH.

24:16.167 --> 24:17.501
>> WELL, SHE WAS
CAUGHT OFF GUARD.

24:17.501 --> 24:19.000
WE WERE ALL
CAUGHT OFF GUARD.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.534
I MEAN, WHO KNEW THAT HAMP
WAS GONNA END UP DEAD?

24:20.534 --> 24:23.067
>> PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY HAD
A REASON TO HATE HIM.

24:23.067 --> 24:25.467
>> WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE
GUYS LIKE HAMP.

24:25.467 --> 24:29.467
WARREN BEATTY IN HIS HEYDAY,
CLOONEY, BRAD PITT.

24:29.467 --> 24:32.734
TIME WAS, YOU COULD HAVE BEEN
ON THAT LIST.

24:32.734 --> 24:34.033
>> TIME WAS?

24:34.033 --> 24:36.267
>> YEAH, I MEAN,
UH, YOU KNOW,

24:36.267 --> 24:37.434
I MEAN,
EVERYBODY HAS THEIR DAY.

24:37.434 --> 24:41.734
AND, UH, YOU'RE SETTLED
AND MARRIED NOW.

24:41.734 --> 24:44.200
>> GALLA DISOBEYED YOU
BECAUSE SHE LOVED HAMP.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.767
>> SHE SAID IT WAS JUST
A CRUSH.

24:46.767 --> 24:49.601
>> YOU SEE THE STATUE HERE?

24:49.601 --> 24:51.634
IT'S CALLED THE DYING GAUL.

24:51.634 --> 24:53.167
HE'S A WARRIOR,
HE'S BEEN STABBED.

24:53.167 --> 24:56.400
HE'S DYING.

24:56.400 --> 24:57.868
BUT EVEN IN DEATH,
HIS PHYSICAL PERFECTION

24:57.868 --> 25:02.033
BRINGS TEARS FROM WOMEN
WHO LOVED HIM.

25:02.033 --> 25:04.767
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S A BIT UNFAIR?

25:04.767 --> 25:07.300
>> NOT SURE I FOLLOW.

25:07.300 --> 25:09.534
>> LIKE HIM.

25:09.534 --> 25:11.267
>> OH, 'CAUSE HE LOOKS
LIKE A STATUE.

25:11.267 --> 25:13.367
WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S ALWAYS
GONNA BE SOMEBODY

25:13.367 --> 25:17.300
WHO'S A LITTLE BETTER LOOKING
OR A HOTTER LAY...

25:17.300 --> 25:20.200
THAN [scoffs] ME.

25:20.200 --> 25:23.334
RIGHT?
THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING.

25:23.334 --> 25:25.133
>> GALLA'S VERY SPECIAL.

25:25.133 --> 25:26.834
IN HER HEYDAY,
I SPENT A LOT OF MONEY

25:26.834 --> 25:30.067
TO FIND OUT
JUST HOW SPECIAL.

25:31.934 --> 25:34.701
SHE SAID I WAS THE BEST
SHE EVER HAD.

25:34.701 --> 25:38.868
SHE EVER SAY THAT ABOUT YOU?

25:38.868 --> 25:40.234
>> SHE SAID
THAT YOU GAVE HER

25:40.234 --> 25:43.200
EMERALD EARRINGS
AND A SABLE COAT.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.033
SHE WAS A HOOKER.
THAT IS WHAT THEY DO.

25:46.033 --> 25:49.767
>> WHATEVER IT TAKES,

25:49.767 --> 25:55.501
GOTTA GET GALLA UNDER CONTROL.

25:55.501 --> 25:59.434
[dialing cell phone]

25:59.434 --> 26:00.834
ARE YOU AT YOUR APARTMENT?

26:00.834 --> 26:02.000
ALL RIGHT, GET OVER THERE
AND STAY THERE,

26:02.000 --> 26:03.734
I'M COMING RIGHT OVER.

26:03.734 --> 26:06.234
>> WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

26:06.234 --> 26:09.667
STASH.

26:09.667 --> 26:11.934
>> THERE IS NOTHING
IN THESE PEOPLE'S LIVES

26:11.934 --> 26:13.767
THAT IS NOT NOTEWORTHY.

26:13.767 --> 26:15.400
>> ANYTHING THAT BRINGS US
CLOSER TO HAVING

26:15.400 --> 26:16.934
AN ACTUAL SUSPECT.

26:16.934 --> 26:19.167
>> THIS HELPS CONFIRM A MOTIVE
FOR DUKE DEGUERIN.

26:19.167 --> 26:20.567
>> AUSTRALIAN TABLOID.

26:20.567 --> 26:21.968
>> YEAH, WE'RE THINKING THAT

26:21.968 --> 26:25.701
DEGUERIN WAS ABLE TO STIFLE
THE COVERAGE IN THE LOCAL PRESS.

26:25.701 --> 26:27.601
>> WHAT WERE THEY DOING
IN MELBOURNE?

26:27.601 --> 26:29.200
A MEETING OF
THE WORLD WILDLIFE FUND.

26:29.200 --> 26:32.501
DUKE'S WIFE AND HAMP TROTTER
WERE BOTH MAJOR SUPPORTERS.

26:32.501 --> 26:34.501
>> WE NEED TO TALK TO HER
ON HER OWN,

26:34.501 --> 26:36.167
WITHOUT HER HUSBAND.

26:36.167 --> 26:37.400
HE KEEPS HER
PRETTY CLOSE TO HOME.

26:37.400 --> 26:41.334
>> SHE'S BEAUTIFUL,
VERY BEAUTIFUL.

26:41.334 --> 26:45.367
THAT KIND OF BEAUTY
REQUIRES HIGH MAINTENANCE.

26:45.367 --> 26:48.701
[inhales and exhales deeply]

26:53.934 --> 26:56.801
>> MRS. DEGUERIN.

26:56.801 --> 26:59.367
DETECTIVE EAMES.

26:59.367 --> 27:03.033
WE MET AT YOUR HUSBAND'S
OFFICES.

27:03.033 --> 27:04.167
>> [scoffs]

27:04.167 --> 27:06.367
I FEEL THIS
IS INAPPROPRIATE.

27:06.367 --> 27:07.968
>> BECAUSE WE DIDN'T
BRING YOU DOWNTOWN

27:07.968 --> 27:13.067
ON A WITNESS WARRANT?

27:13.067 --> 27:16.067
>> ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

27:16.067 --> 27:20.434
>> MAYBE WHAT YOU WANT.

27:20.434 --> 27:23.534
JUSTICE FOR HAMP TROTTER.

27:23.534 --> 27:26.901
>> OF COURSE I WANT THAT.

27:26.901 --> 27:28.601
EVERYONE DOES.

27:28.601 --> 27:32.434
>> BUT YOU KNEW HIM.

27:32.434 --> 27:35.667
SHARED INTERESTS.

27:35.667 --> 27:38.033
WORLD WILDLIFE FUND.

27:38.033 --> 27:41.267
MELBOURNE.

27:41.267 --> 27:45.934
YOUR HUSBAND IS
A VERY PROUD MAN.

27:45.934 --> 27:51.501
WAS HE JEALOUS?

27:51.501 --> 27:54.767
>> THERE WAS NOTHING
TO BE JEALOUS ABOUT.

27:54.767 --> 27:57.901
>> YOUR TEARS SAY
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

28:01.968 --> 28:05.434
>> IT'S SWEAT.

28:05.434 --> 28:10.534
>> YOU CONTINUED SEEING HAMP,
GAVE HIM GIFTS.

28:10.534 --> 28:13.901
KNOWING HOW YOUR HUSBAND FELT,

28:13.901 --> 28:15.934
WE KNOW IN THE PAST
YOUR HUSBAND

28:15.934 --> 28:18.167
PHYSICALLY PUNISHED PEOPLE
WHO THREATENED--

28:18.167 --> 28:22.033
>> YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU
I THINK MY HUSBAND KILLED HAMP?

28:22.033 --> 28:24.000
I HAVE TO THINK OF MYSELF.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.567
WHERE WOULD I BE
IF I SAID THAT?

28:25.567 --> 28:27.934
>> YOU'RE AFRAID.

28:30.868 --> 28:34.267
>> DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
THE POWER HE HAS?

28:34.267 --> 28:36.300
>> IT'S JUST MONEY.

28:36.300 --> 28:38.000
>> NO.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.801
IT'S WHAT COMES WITH MONEY.

28:40.801 --> 28:44.934
LITTLE PEOPLE LIKE YOU
DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

28:44.934 --> 28:47.968
ONCE, I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT.

28:50.667 --> 28:53.968
>> WE CAN PROTECT YOU.

28:58.033 --> 29:01.033
>> IF I LET MYSELF
BELIEVE THAT,

29:01.033 --> 29:04.033
I'D BE RISKING MY LIFE.

29:04.033 --> 29:05.834
>> THEN YOU KNOW
WHAT HE'S DONE.

29:11.501 --> 29:15.267
SHE SUSPECTS HIM,
MAYBE EVEN KNOWS HE DID IT.

29:15.267 --> 29:18.334
BUT SHE'S TOO AFRAID TO TALK.

29:18.334 --> 29:22.400
>> THE EVIDENCE WE COULD HAVE
USED TO PRESSURE HER,

29:22.400 --> 29:24.567
THE KENNEBRAGH SCOTCH
FROM HAMP'S LOFT,

29:24.567 --> 29:26.634
IT'S MISSING.

29:26.634 --> 29:28.767
>> MAYBE THE BOTTLES
WEREN'T BROUGHT IN.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.167
>> I LISTED IT MYSELF.

29:31.167 --> 29:34.467
>> WELL, IT'S NOT
A PERFECT WORLD.

29:34.467 --> 29:36.834
SOME SCOTCH LOVING COP
OBVIOUSLY DRANK IT.

29:36.834 --> 29:39.701
BUT WE STILL HAVE THESE.

29:39.701 --> 29:42.067
DEGUERIN'S GIFT BOTTLES
HAD HANDWRITTEN NUMBERED LABELS.

29:42.067 --> 29:44.901
THE NUMBERS TIE TO AVIA'S
CHRISTMAS LIST

29:44.901 --> 29:46.501
AND THAT TIES HER TO HAMP.

29:46.501 --> 29:50.400
>> IT DOESN'T TIE ANYTHING
TO ANYTHING WITHOUT THE SCOTCH.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.067
>> WELL, THOSE BOTTLES
CAME IN CASES,

29:52.067 --> 29:55.634
AND THE CASES
WERE ALSO NUMBERED.

29:55.634 --> 29:58.267
>> THEY COULD BE STILL
AT HAMP'S LOFT.

30:02.834 --> 30:04.267
LOOK, SOMEBODY'S
BEEN HERE BEFORE.

30:04.267 --> 30:06.934
THEY PUT A SEAL
OVER THE PREVIOUS SEAL.

30:32.968 --> 30:36.133
YEAH, THEY'RE NUMBERED.

30:36.133 --> 30:39.033
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

30:39.033 --> 30:41.968
>> IT WASN'T CSU
WHO BROKE THE SEAL.

30:59.300 --> 31:00.501
>> PROFOUND BRUISING.

31:00.501 --> 31:03.334
I'D SAY FROM THUMBS
PRESSED INTO HER THROAT.

31:03.334 --> 31:06.767
I'D ALMOST BET WE'LL FIND
A BROKEN HYOID BONE.

31:06.767 --> 31:09.267
>> UP CLOSE AND VERY PERSONAL.

31:09.267 --> 31:10.968
>> HE WANTED TO SEE HER FACE,
TO SEE HER FEAR.

31:10.968 --> 31:13.968
PULLED HER JEANS DOWN,
LEFT HER UNDERWEAR ON.

31:13.968 --> 31:16.400
>> SO HE NEVER CONSUMMATED?

31:16.400 --> 31:19.601
>> I THINK HIS RAGE WAS GREATER
THAN HIS DESIRE.

31:19.601 --> 31:21.367
>> I DON'T AGREE.
I DID A VAGINAL SWAB.

31:21.367 --> 31:23.701
I'M PRETTY SURE WE HAVE SEMEN.

31:23.701 --> 31:25.334
>> SO WE'LL HAVE DNA.

31:25.334 --> 31:26.634
SHE'S CARRYING HER JEWELRY.

31:26.634 --> 31:30.100
YELLOW DIAMOND EARRINGS,
RUBY STUDS.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.667
>> SHE'S WEARING EMERALDS.

31:33.667 --> 31:36.133
>> SHE WAS PACKED FOR TRAVEL.

31:36.133 --> 31:38.968
PASSPORT, TICKET PRINTOUT...

31:38.968 --> 31:41.567
ARUBA.

31:45.033 --> 31:47.467
>> WONDER WHO WAS WAITING
FOR HER AT THE PLANE.

31:47.467 --> 31:50.400
>> AN APPRAISAL SLIP
FOR THE RUBY EARRINGS.

31:50.400 --> 31:54.734
PURCHASED BY STANISLAV BARDEM.

31:54.734 --> 31:58.067
>> SOON AS I SAW THE UNIFORMS
AT THE AIRPORT, I KNEW.

31:58.067 --> 31:59.868
>> I'M SURE YOU KNEW
BEFORE THAT.

31:59.868 --> 32:02.734
>> WHAT, THAT GALLA WAS DEAD?
NO, NO, NO.

32:02.734 --> 32:04.334
NO, I ACTUALLY HOPED
THAT WE WERE GONNA MAKE IT

32:04.334 --> 32:06.534
OUT OF THE WOODS.

32:06.534 --> 32:09.534
>> YOUR PRINTS ARE ON THE SEAL
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

32:09.534 --> 32:11.067
WE ALSO HAVE SEMEN.

32:11.067 --> 32:14.267
>> YEAH.
AND I'LL BE A MATCH.

32:14.267 --> 32:16.801
WE MADE LOVE AT HER PLACE.

32:16.801 --> 32:18.434
AFTER I BEGGED HER,

32:18.434 --> 32:20.334
BEGGED HER TO GET
OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

32:23.234 --> 32:24.901
>> WELL, THERE'S--

32:24.901 --> 32:29.701
GALLA WAS SAVVY ABOUT MEN.

32:29.701 --> 32:31.234
>> OH, SHE HAD THAT DOWN.

32:31.234 --> 32:33.701
>> I GUESS YOU WOULD HAVE
DRESSED LIKE THAT

32:33.701 --> 32:37.901
FOR ANY MAN THAT
SHE WAS WAITING FOR.

32:37.901 --> 32:39.501
YOU GAVE HER THESE, RIGHT?

32:39.501 --> 32:44.367
>> YEAH.

32:44.367 --> 32:46.300
I'D HAVE GIVEN HER THE WORLD.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.434
>> WELL, WHEN WE FOUND HER,
SHE WASN'T WEARING THOSE.

32:52.434 --> 32:57.734
SHE WAS WEARING
THESE EMERALDS.

33:00.133 --> 33:03.968
I GUESS SHE WAS WEARING THEM
FOR THE MAN THAT KILLED HER.

33:09.901 --> 33:13.400
YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS?

33:13.400 --> 33:15.300
>> WELL, I CAN TELL YOU
WHO GAVE HER THE EMERALDS,

33:15.300 --> 33:18.000
BUT THAT'S NOT
GONNA ACQUIT ME.

33:18.000 --> 33:22.200
>> WE WANT THE MAN
WHO'S GUILTY, STASH.

33:25.400 --> 33:28.334
>> DUKE DEGUERIN.

33:28.334 --> 33:30.901
HE GAVE 'EM TO HER
AS A BONUS,

33:30.901 --> 33:33.767
FOR SAYING
HE WAS A GREAT LAY.

33:33.767 --> 33:35.834
>> WHY'D HE KILL HER?

33:35.834 --> 33:37.100
>> I DON'T KNOW.

33:37.100 --> 33:41.000
THAT GOES INTO SOME
SICK KIND OF THING

33:41.000 --> 33:43.834
THAT RELATES
TO HAMP TROTTER.

33:43.834 --> 33:45.434
>> YOU MEAN HE WAS JEALOUS.

33:45.434 --> 33:47.267
>> WELL, MORE THAN THAT.

33:47.267 --> 33:48.701
IT WAS WEIRDER.

33:48.701 --> 33:52.133
LIKE WHEN, UH, THE TABLOIDS
HAD PHOTOS OF GALLA

33:52.133 --> 33:54.501
AT HAMP'S PROTEST...

33:54.501 --> 33:57.000
IT DROVE DEGUERIN CRAZY.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.667
IT WAS, UH, ONE OF THOSE "MINE'S
BIGGER THAN YOURS" THING.

34:01.667 --> 34:04.701
ONLY I DOUBT THAT HAMP KNEW
HE WAS IN THE GAME.

34:10.967 --> 34:13.067
>> FUNNY HOW MY MEMO
ABOUT COMING IN ON TIME

34:13.067 --> 34:15.501
GOT AN OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE
RESPONSE.

34:15.501 --> 34:16.801
IT IS 3:00 A.M.

34:16.801 --> 34:18.501
>> WE COULD BE VERY CLOSE
ON GALLA'S MURDER.

34:18.501 --> 34:19.967
>> WHAT'S THE RUSH?
DNA?

34:19.967 --> 34:21.400
THAT'LL TAKE WEEKS
TO PROCESS.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.300
>> ACTUALLY, WE'RE MOVING
IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

34:23.300 --> 34:26.266
>> OKAY, I'LL HAVE SOMEONE
GET BACK TO THEM.

34:26.266 --> 34:28.100
IT WAS JAMIE WITZGER.

34:28.100 --> 34:29.701
HE GAVE ME THE NAMES
OF THREE WOMEN.

34:29.701 --> 34:31.234
WE'LL BRING THEM IN.

34:31.234 --> 34:33.567
>> THE PIMP, JAMIE WITZGER?
WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH HIM?

34:33.567 --> 34:36.434
>> LOOK, I NEED TO TELL YOU
I SENT TWO OFFICERS

34:36.434 --> 34:38.900
TO DUKE DEGUERIN'S PENTHOUSE.

34:38.900 --> 34:40.934
THEY'RE GONNA BRING HIM IN.
HE'LL BE HERE WITHIN THE HOUR.

34:40.934 --> 34:43.333
>> WE'RE ALSO BRINGING HIS WIFE
AS A MATERIAL WITNESS.

34:45.132 --> 34:49.199
>> PLEASE TELL ME WE HAVE
UNASSAILABLE EVIDENCE.

34:49.199 --> 34:51.132
YOU REALIZE THAT
ARRESTING DEGUERIN

34:51.132 --> 34:52.367
WITH ALL HIS CONNECTIONS--

34:52.367 --> 34:54.634
>> WE HAVE A SHOT
AT GETTING HIS CONFESSION,

34:54.634 --> 34:56.734
BUT WE HAVE TO MOVE
BEFORE GALLA'S DEATH

34:56.734 --> 34:57.901
HITS THE MORNING NEWS.

34:57.901 --> 34:59.701
>> CONFESSION.

34:59.701 --> 35:02.901
DEGUERIN SPEAKS THROUGH
$1,000 AN HOUR ATTORNEYS.

35:02.901 --> 35:05.167
HE CAN'T BE ENTRAPPED
INTO ADMITTING ANYTHING.

35:05.167 --> 35:06.834
WHY DID YOU CALL ME?

35:06.834 --> 35:08.367
YOU SHOULD HAVE ACTED
ON YOUR OWN.

35:08.367 --> 35:09.868
I COULD HAVE CLAIMED IMMUNITY.

35:09.868 --> 35:11.767
>> WE NEED YOU.
YOU'RE PART OF THE PLAN.

35:13.968 --> 35:15.300
>> I'M TAKING THE NAMES
OF EVERYONE.

35:15.300 --> 35:17.868
YOUR DISMISSAL,
LOSS OF PENSION BENEFITS.

35:17.868 --> 35:20.868
AND YOU'RE GONNA
HEAD THIS LIST.

35:20.868 --> 35:22.767
>> WE'RE SORRY
FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.

35:22.767 --> 35:24.434
>> BEING DRAGGED FROM MY HOME
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

35:24.434 --> 35:25.934
IS BEYOND INCONVENIENCE.

35:25.934 --> 35:27.367
>> YOU'LL SEE WE HAVE
GOOD REASON.

35:27.367 --> 35:29.200
MRS. DEGUERIN, CAN I MAKE YOU
MORE COMFORTABLE

35:29.200 --> 35:32.801
WHILE WE TALK
TO YOUR HUSBAND?

35:32.801 --> 35:34.100
>> YEAH, LET'S ALL KILL TIME

35:34.100 --> 35:36.467
TILL MY LAWYER ARRIVES
TO KILL YOU.

35:42.767 --> 35:44.467
>> WE CAN TALK IN HERE.

36:04.100 --> 36:07.434
WHAT?

36:07.434 --> 36:10.701
YOU CAN SIT.

36:15.601 --> 36:21.033
IT'S AMAZING HOW UNCERTAINTY
PLAYS A ROLE IN OUR LIFE.

36:24.434 --> 36:26.701
I DON'T KNOW,
YOU LEAVE YOUR KEYS BY THE DOOR,

36:26.701 --> 36:29.901
YOU GO BACK, YOU LOOK,
THEY'RE GONE.

36:29.901 --> 36:33.701
YOU LEAVE A PERSON,
YOU THINK THEY'RE--

36:33.701 --> 36:35.868
IN--IN TRUTH,
YOU JUST NEVER KNOW.

36:35.868 --> 36:37.434
>> THAT WOMAN'S A WHORE.

36:37.434 --> 36:38.734
>> PARDON?

36:38.734 --> 36:41.200
>> [scoffs]

36:41.200 --> 36:43.934
WHATEVER LIES
SHE'S TOLD YOU--

36:43.934 --> 36:46.267
>> THE WOMAN YOU SAW
WITH THE EMERALD EARRINGS.

36:46.267 --> 36:47.968
>> GALLA.

36:47.968 --> 36:49.701
IT'S LIKE THIS WITH WHORES.

36:49.701 --> 36:50.868
YOU PAY FOR THEIR SERVICES,

36:50.868 --> 36:52.000
SOMETIMES THINGS GET
A LITTLE ROUGH.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.601
>> THE SEX GETS ROUGH.

36:53.601 --> 36:55.701
>> EVERYTHING WAS DONE
WITH HER CONSENT.

36:55.701 --> 36:57.367
>> [scoffs]

36:57.367 --> 37:00.000
SO THE BRUISES
ON GALLA'S THROAT?

37:00.000 --> 37:01.868
YOU CHOKED HER AS PART
OF A SEX GAME?

37:01.868 --> 37:03.801
>> DISTASTEFUL,
BUT NOT ILLEGAL.

37:03.801 --> 37:07.767
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
WHATEVER LIES SHE'S TOLD YOU.

37:07.767 --> 37:12.067
>> SO YOU CHOKED HER
AND YOU LEFT HER FOR DEAD.

37:12.067 --> 37:16.801
IT'S A GAME.
SHE ACTS IT.

37:16.801 --> 37:19.601
>> INTERESTING THAT
YOU'RE VOLUNTEERING ALL THIS.

37:19.601 --> 37:22.334
SHE HASN'T ACCUSED YOU
OF ANYTHING.

37:28.100 --> 37:29.501
>> THEN WHY AM I HERE?

37:29.501 --> 37:32.934
>> YOU WANTED GALLA TO EXPOSE
HAMP TROTTER

37:32.934 --> 37:35.367
AS A DRUG ADDICT.

37:35.367 --> 37:36.901
>> [scoffs]

37:36.901 --> 37:39.601
OH, THAT'S WHAT SHE ALLEGES.

37:39.601 --> 37:42.834
>> ACTUALLY, WE HAVE TESTIMONY
FROM AN EMPLOYEE OF YOURS.

37:42.834 --> 37:46.434
>> YEAH, STASH BARDEM.

37:46.434 --> 37:48.267
HE WAS GALLA'S LOVER.

37:48.267 --> 37:50.267
HE WANTED TO RUIN HAMP
OUT OF JEALOUSY.

37:50.267 --> 37:54.434
AND NOW HE'S TRYING
TO BLAME ME.

37:54.434 --> 37:55.767
>> JEALOUSY WORKS AS A MOTIVE.

37:55.767 --> 38:00.300
>> JEALOUSY IS A MANIFESTATION
OF PROFOUND FEELINGS.

38:00.300 --> 38:01.734
THAT'S HARDLY WHAT I FELT
FOR THAT WHORE.

38:01.734 --> 38:05.467
>> IT'S ALSO EVIDENCE
OF WEAKNESS AND FEAR.

38:05.467 --> 38:07.934
PATHOLOGICAL LOW SELF-ESTEEM.

38:07.934 --> 38:10.767
>> IT'S NOT PART
OF MY CARRIAGE.

38:10.767 --> 38:12.067
>> THAT'S TRUE.

38:12.067 --> 38:14.501
YOURS IS MASKED
BY AN INFLATED EGO.

38:16.934 --> 38:18.400
BUT YOU STILL LOOK
THROUGH THAT WINDOW,

38:18.400 --> 38:21.767
YOU SEE HAMP
FLEXING HIS ABS,

38:21.767 --> 38:26.300
THE CITY BUZZES
ABOUT HIS SEXUAL PROWESS...

38:26.300 --> 38:28.601
HE'S PENETRATED DEEP
INTO YOUR LIFE.

38:28.601 --> 38:30.501
>> WATCH IT.

38:30.501 --> 38:34.100
>> YOUR WIFE SLEPT WITH HIM.
GAVE HIM GIFTS.

38:34.100 --> 38:37.167
DIDN'T THAT BOTHER YOU?

38:37.167 --> 38:38.400
>> AND I HAD HIS WIFE.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.267
YOU SAW THE INSCRIPTION
ON THAT POSTER.

38:40.267 --> 38:42.234
I WAS THE BEST.

38:42.234 --> 38:47.567
>> YEAH, BUT TO GET IT,
YOU HAD TO FINANCE HIS FILM.

38:47.567 --> 38:49.300
HE NEVER HAD TO PAY FOR IT.

38:49.300 --> 38:51.634
HAMP, WELL, HE WAS PENNILESS
WHEN HE WAS MARRIED TO HER.

38:51.634 --> 38:53.267
YOU KNOW,
WOMEN STILL WANTED HIM.

38:53.267 --> 38:56.200
THEY DESIRED HIM.

38:56.200 --> 38:59.133
I THINK THEY EVEN WEPT
FOR HIM.

38:59.133 --> 39:01.868
THESE ARE THINGS
THEY NEVER DID FOR YOU.

39:04.467 --> 39:05.968
>> I'M HERE
ON THE WORD OF A WHORE

39:05.968 --> 39:07.434
AND A DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE.

39:07.434 --> 39:09.834
I DON'T NEED THIS!

39:09.834 --> 39:12.300
>> YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

39:12.300 --> 39:16.434
YOU ALREADY ADMITTED
TO CHOKING HER.

39:16.434 --> 39:17.934
SHE'S DEAD.

39:24.868 --> 39:28.400
>> [scoffs]

39:33.467 --> 39:35.300
SO...

39:35.300 --> 39:38.968
[scoffs]

39:48.968 --> 39:53.601
>> YOU STRANGLED GALLA
ON HAMP'S BED...

39:53.601 --> 39:58.100
TO REMIND HER
THE POWER YOU TOOK OVER HIM.

39:58.100 --> 40:01.834
DID YOU FEEL THAT STRENGTH
WHEN YOU SAW HIM

40:01.834 --> 40:04.534
AFTER GALLA
HAD DONE HER JOB?

40:04.534 --> 40:06.400
>> YES.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.801
I THANKED HER
FOR A JOB WELL DONE.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.601
>> AND DRUGGING HIM
WASN'T ENOUGH.

40:14.601 --> 40:16.834
IT COULDN'T GET RID
OF THAT WEAKNESS.

40:16.834 --> 40:18.434
THE WEAKNESS THAT YOU FELT--

40:18.434 --> 40:21.534
>> WHEN I MOST NEEDED
TO BE A MAN.

40:30.033 --> 40:34.000
WHEN I WAS A CHILD,
MY AUNT GAVE ME A KITTEN.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.334
IT SCRATCHED ME.

40:35.334 --> 40:38.267
THE SCRATCH BECAME INFECTED
AND WOULDN'T HEAL.

40:38.267 --> 40:40.467
THEN I JUST HELD THE LITTLE
ANIMAL A CERTAIN WAY.

40:40.467 --> 40:41.534
SO EASY.

40:41.534 --> 40:45.968
TREMORS,
NOT REALLY A STRUGGLE.

40:45.968 --> 40:50.767
WITHIN A WEEK,
THE SCRATCH WAS GONE.

40:50.767 --> 40:54.601
I WAS FINE.

41:02.033 --> 41:05.501
>> AND GALLA,
WHAT WAS HER OFFENSE?

41:09.434 --> 41:12.000
>> SHE CRIED.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.234
LIKE THEY ALL CRIED.

41:15.234 --> 41:16.968
FOR HIM.

41:21.834 --> 41:25.634
SO NOW,
THE THEATRICS OF A TRIAL?

41:25.634 --> 41:26.934
CHEAP-SUITED PROSECUTORS

41:26.934 --> 41:30.701
AGAINST THE FINEST DEFENSE TEAM
MONEY CAN ASSEMBLE.

41:30.701 --> 41:32.701
I'VE SAID NOTHING
UNDER OATH.

41:32.701 --> 41:37.334
THE CHARADE WON'T WASH.

41:37.334 --> 41:41.234
>> DON'T FORGET ME, DUKE.

41:41.234 --> 41:44.033
THEY BROUGHT ME
AS A MATERIAL WITNESS.

41:49.300 --> 41:53.834
ODD, SEEING FEAR ON YOU.

41:53.834 --> 41:55.701
I THINK I LIKE IT.

41:58.901 --> 42:01.868
I HOPE TO SEE MORE OF IT.
