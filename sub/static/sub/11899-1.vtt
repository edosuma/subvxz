01:55.180 --> 01:56.300
Relax, man. l'm coming

02:17.460 --> 02:19.140
''Singde Gate''

03:47.700 --> 03:49.420
You've come from afar,

03:49.540 --> 03:51.460
you must have seen a lot on your trips.

03:51.580 --> 03:53.380
Khan, everyone's talking about you,

03:53.500 --> 03:54.740
they are all really impressed.

03:55.140 --> 03:57.700
We won't have much time to chat
during the day,

03:57.780 --> 04:01.740
there's a banquet tonight,

04:01.820 --> 04:03.700
you shall accompany me.

04:03.780 --> 04:04.780
Thank you, Khan.

04:35.820 --> 04:40.140
Let's have a display of martial arts
for entertainment

04:40.220 --> 04:41.380
Khan.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.140
Dulidan, warrior from Labu,

04:44.220 --> 04:46.900
challenges Wen Guer, warrior from Wengubu.

06:42.780 --> 06:44.580
Wen Guer's bone is broken.

06:57.980 --> 06:59.820
Warrior Abulahua from Zhadelanbu,

06:59.940 --> 07:02.580
challenges Huerchi, warrior from Mierqibu.

08:20.180 --> 08:21.340
Khan.

08:21.420 --> 08:24.820
Our warrior Chilegutai, from Chadaerbu,
would like to

08:24.940 --> 08:26.980
challenge Mongolia's number one warrior.

08:27.100 --> 08:28.140
Chilegutai.

08:33.700 --> 08:34.740
Go on.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.380
Caidalu, you see,

08:45.500 --> 08:47.300
you've a challenger.

10:05.220 --> 10:06.380
Khan.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.860
Dulidan would like to challenge
Chilegutai too.

10:11.380 --> 10:12.260
Alright.

11:32.060 --> 11:33.060
Wait.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.820
What's your name?

11:44.700 --> 11:45.620
Dulidan.

11:45.740 --> 11:47.460
Back off, Dulidan.

11:47.580 --> 11:48.460
Yes, Khan.

11:56.420 --> 11:57.740
Caidalu,

11:57.820 --> 12:00.340
have a 2nd round with the one who uses
double blades.

12:01.780 --> 12:02.580
Yes, Khan.

12:44.980 --> 12:46.060
Stop.

12:47.940 --> 12:49.300
What's your name?

12:51.660 --> 12:52.700
Abulahua.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.700
Dulidan,

12:59.540 --> 13:01.380
Abulahua,

13:01.900 --> 13:05.260
you two, along with Caidalu,

13:05.380 --> 13:07.940
are Mongolia's Best Three Warriors,

13:08.020 --> 13:12.100
you'll be rewarded & you'll stand guard
by my side.

13:12.180 --> 13:13.140
Yes, Khan.

13:13.620 --> 13:14.940
Marco Polo.

13:20.780 --> 13:24.340
l order you to tour around, study

13:24.420 --> 13:28.540
different areas of my Empire
in 3 years time.

13:28.660 --> 13:30.380
l'll give you other important tasks
afterwards.

14:32.260 --> 14:33.780
That was a long report.

14:33.900 --> 14:36.220
lt took me a month to read it.

14:36.340 --> 14:38.660
lt's my work for the last three years.

14:45.380 --> 14:46.380
Khan.

14:49.980 --> 14:51.260
There are assassins in the palace,

14:51.380 --> 14:52.500
please be careful.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.500
There're over 10 checkpoints even
for me to go through,

14:55.580 --> 14:56.740
how did they come in?

16:39.340 --> 16:43.020
You, go back to Yangzhou,

16:43.140 --> 16:44.380
and come up with another plan.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.660
What? He knows the ''Bell Cover''?

17:58.980 --> 18:03.140
Caidalu, Dulidan, Abulahua,

18:03.980 --> 18:05.180
back off you three.

18:22.420 --> 18:24.140
Chase...

18:30.940 --> 18:35.060
Chase...

18:35.980 --> 18:39.380
l heard that when they've mastered
the ''Bell Cover'',

18:39.460 --> 18:40.900
they are unscathed from all weapons,

18:40.980 --> 18:44.140
how could you hurt him?

18:44.220 --> 18:45.100
l guess that

18:45.180 --> 18:47.660
lt could be Caidalu's ''Great Palm''

18:47.780 --> 18:50.780
has already injured him internally,

18:50.900 --> 18:53.100
or that he hasn't really mastered it

18:53.180 --> 18:55.340
for 100%.

18:59.500 --> 19:00.380
Do you know

19:00.460 --> 19:03.620
why l let him go?

19:03.740 --> 19:05.180
l don't know.

19:11.100 --> 19:12.980
He mentioned Yangzhou before he died,

19:13.060 --> 19:14.940
they must be based in Yangzhou.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.740
You plan to uproot them, Khan.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.580
Listen for lmperial order, Marco Polo.

19:27.100 --> 19:31.260
You're now the Royal lnspector,

19:31.380 --> 19:35.260
got to watch what the Hans are doing
in Yangzhou,

19:35.380 --> 19:36.860
do your best to suppress them.

19:36.980 --> 19:37.700
Yes, Khan.

19:45.940 --> 19:46.980
-Eldest brother...
-Jian...

19:48.180 --> 19:49.180
Eldest brother

19:49.660 --> 19:50.620
Brother Jian

19:59.980 --> 20:01.740
Don't cry, dear.

20:22.820 --> 20:25.220
l don't think l can make it.

20:26.540 --> 20:31.140
Kid brother, from now on,

20:31.220 --> 20:32.940
you're the only man in the family,

20:33.060 --> 20:35.660
take care of your sister-in-law.

20:38.540 --> 20:39.820
Can you walk?

20:53.180 --> 20:57.540
l have five sworn brothers,

20:57.620 --> 20:59.700
you've only met Brother Jin,

21:00.180 --> 21:02.500
he died in the mission.

21:02.580 --> 21:04.020
There are four others,

21:04.140 --> 21:07.140
they are all martial arts experts.

21:07.260 --> 21:08.500
You...

21:17.740 --> 21:19.700
Protect my wife, hurry!

21:19.780 --> 21:20.340
No...

21:20.460 --> 21:21.740
Let's go, sister-in-law.

21:24.180 --> 21:26.980
Hurry...

21:44.980 --> 21:46.660
Don't worry, l'll protect you.

22:21.180 --> 22:22.220
Jian.

23:03.020 --> 23:04.300
Kid brother.

23:13.980 --> 23:15.460
Don't touch her, stop.

24:02.500 --> 24:03.780
Jian.

25:07.740 --> 25:08.980
Go.

25:15.180 --> 25:18.220
Go.

25:21.060 --> 25:22.460
Go.

25:27.540 --> 25:28.420
Wait.

25:54.660 --> 25:55.660
Come on.

25:58.220 --> 25:59.540
Where are you transporting the salt to?

26:01.540 --> 26:02.820
Yangzhou.

26:04.060 --> 26:05.300
Are you robbers?

26:05.380 --> 26:06.980
We are officials from Yangzhou,

26:07.100 --> 26:09.580
and are about to bring this woman there.

26:09.660 --> 26:11.260
Could you give her a lift?

26:18.220 --> 26:19.220
Faster.

26:31.180 --> 26:32.380
l didn't start it, officer.

26:32.500 --> 26:33.940
He was trying to chop me up.

26:39.740 --> 26:41.020
lt's not that l can't give up the salt,

26:41.140 --> 26:43.620
but this is an one-wheeled cart,
it will top over,

26:43.740 --> 26:44.860
how can l push it?

27:02.980 --> 27:06.420
Selling the salt to Tiandao Mansion
one could earn lot.

27:45.580 --> 27:46.820
Please.

30:44.820 --> 30:46.940
Strange woman, she wouldn't eat.

30:47.020 --> 30:50.180
Even though being captured by tartars
she isn't scared

30:52.180 --> 30:54.180
l peed in their soup

30:54.300 --> 30:55.460
just earlier,

30:55.580 --> 30:57.140
my secret recipe.

30:59.860 --> 31:01.780
The woman sat in the cart for a whole day,

31:01.900 --> 31:04.740
she said we should send the salt to
Tiandao Mansion

31:04.820 --> 31:05.900
for selling at a good price.

31:07.020 --> 31:08.780
What do you think, Brother Zhou?

31:10.580 --> 31:12.340
l guess she could be Brother Zu's wife.

31:12.420 --> 31:15.060
Brother Zhou, the five of us are
sworn brothers,

31:15.180 --> 31:16.260
we swore to fight the tartars.

31:16.380 --> 31:18.340
lf she really is Brother Zu's wife.

31:18.420 --> 31:19.460
She indeed is.

31:19.580 --> 31:20.500
Can't be wrong.

31:20.580 --> 31:22.020
Only Brother Zu is married,

31:22.140 --> 31:22.860
he told us that his wife

31:22.980 --> 31:25.020
is the daughter of the Chief of
Tiandao Mansion.

31:25.140 --> 31:26.260
No matter if she is or not,

31:26.380 --> 31:27.540
we must try to save her.

31:27.660 --> 31:28.500
Right.

31:46.660 --> 31:50.780
Your husband tried to assassinate
the Khan, not you

31:51.860 --> 31:54.820
as long as you tell us about
his accomplices.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.300
Your husband was a brave man,

32:08.380 --> 32:09.780
and you two were a good match.

33:27.820 --> 33:28.820
Retreat.

33:31.900 --> 33:33.060
Accomplices indeed !

33:37.980 --> 33:38.740
Go.

33:39.660 --> 33:42.780
Stop ! lt may be a trick,

33:45.900 --> 33:47.940
they're trying to ''lure the tiger out
of the mountain''.

33:48.980 --> 33:50.740
They want to lure us away here.

33:52.060 --> 33:53.540
We'll go with the flow.

33:58.660 --> 34:01.140
We should turn the trick back
on the woman.

34:01.700 --> 34:02.660
Master.

34:03.020 --> 34:04.820
The Khan has ordered you.

34:40.300 --> 34:41.260
Are you Brother Zu's wife?

34:42.100 --> 34:46.620
You are Jianmin's...

34:46.739 --> 34:48.580
We're his sworn brothers.

34:49.179 --> 34:50.260
Right.

34:52.900 --> 34:56.699
He mentioned you before he died.

34:56.780 --> 34:57.980
Wait.

34:58.100 --> 34:59.580
lf they are after us,

34:59.700 --> 35:02.580
why would they leave her here?

35:02.660 --> 35:04.340
lntentionally?

35:04.460 --> 35:06.460
They might want to find a lead from her.

35:07.940 --> 35:10.540
That's not much use.

35:10.660 --> 35:13.300
My father is a well-known figure here.

35:13.700 --> 35:17.260
The Yangzhou officials are already
keeping a close eye.

35:18.900 --> 35:21.060
Let's go to my home first.

35:21.180 --> 35:23.340
Brother Zu was...

35:30.580 --> 35:32.980
Killed by the tartars.

35:34.580 --> 35:40.140
Two brothers died on the same day.

36:31.020 --> 36:36.540
''Tiandao Mansion''

37:51.820 --> 37:52.700
What are you doing?

37:52.780 --> 37:55.580
We're yet to master kung fu skills.
Please teach us,

37:55.700 --> 37:58.140
so we can fight the tartars and revenge
for Brother Zu.

37:58.220 --> 38:00.500
Stop joking.

38:00.580 --> 38:04.740
Martial arts practice is prohibited
for civilians

38:04.820 --> 38:07.260
l'm old now,

38:07.380 --> 38:10.420
even l was fond of boxing and kicking
in the past,

38:10.540 --> 38:12.580
but l've forgotten most of it.

38:17.940 --> 38:19.900
lf you're not...

38:20.500 --> 38:21.780
Stand up, please.

38:25.060 --> 38:28.060
But l could use some help around here.

38:28.180 --> 38:30.140
lf you want to stay,

38:30.220 --> 38:32.180
will you let me to assign your work?

38:32.300 --> 38:32.980
Yes.

38:33.100 --> 38:37.940
Alright, you go to the garden to carry
the fertilizer.

38:38.540 --> 38:41.060
You work on the stone field at the back
of the mansion.

38:42.740 --> 38:45.020
Cut up the bamboo branches in the east.

38:45.140 --> 38:45.860
Yes.

38:46.220 --> 38:47.820
Master, please take care of me.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.220
Turn the grindstone in the mill.

38:55.580 --> 38:56.340
Father.

38:56.460 --> 38:57.460
Stay out of this.

38:59.140 --> 39:00.260
Take some rest now,

39:00.380 --> 39:02.500
you will be led to your work place
tomorrow.

39:20.740 --> 39:23.940
Faster...over there...

39:37.940 --> 39:41.140
l'm Chief of Yangzhou, welcome,
Mr. Marco Polo.

40:30.420 --> 40:32.060
So you're the new grindstone donkey?

40:32.180 --> 40:34.540
Call me whatever you please,
l'm lucked out.

40:43.260 --> 40:46.300
You must fry the beans first before
you grind them,

40:46.380 --> 40:47.660
understand?

40:47.780 --> 40:48.900
Whatever.

40:50.980 --> 40:52.300
Build a fire first.

41:12.940 --> 41:15.060
We aren't allowed to keep knives,

41:15.180 --> 41:16.460
break up these bamboo branches,

41:16.580 --> 41:18.020
fifty a day.

43:17.980 --> 43:20.660
Did the chief send you, young man?

43:20.780 --> 43:22.580
Yes, you are...

43:22.700 --> 43:24.900
Your supervisor.

43:24.980 --> 43:27.220
Make sure you won't slack.

43:27.340 --> 43:29.580
And check whether you've got strength.

43:31.380 --> 43:33.420
That's the one thing l do have.

44:37.300 --> 44:38.380
You...

44:38.500 --> 44:39.380
So?

44:39.500 --> 44:41.420
Did the chief feed you?

44:41.540 --> 44:44.340
Or you're just too weak?

44:45.940 --> 44:46.780
What?

44:46.900 --> 44:50.140
You should use your strength to
fight the tartars,

44:50.260 --> 44:52.060
not at an old man like me.

44:54.460 --> 44:55.300
Hurry!

44:55.380 --> 44:58.140
Move the stones around.

44:58.260 --> 45:01.180
l love watching stones moving houses.

45:16.380 --> 45:21.220
Strength...you will have 'qi' before
you have strength.

45:21.340 --> 45:24.940
Qi is inner strength, then you've
your outer strength.

45:25.020 --> 45:26.980
Without inner strength,

45:27.060 --> 45:29.060
then you won't be much good,

45:29.180 --> 45:31.940
you might just look more muscular than
the others.

46:04.620 --> 46:06.180
Where's the fertilizer pool?

46:13.660 --> 46:14.900
So it's not fertilizer.

46:15.580 --> 46:16.620
Careful.

46:16.740 --> 46:18.740
lf you drop in,

46:18.860 --> 46:20.820
l'm too lazy to get up,

46:20.940 --> 46:22.500
no one will pull you out.

46:23.220 --> 46:24.020
Don't worry,

46:24.140 --> 46:25.980
it's not a problem even if it's deeper.

47:03.740 --> 47:06.940
Whoever climbs up is an asshole.

47:12.700 --> 47:13.940
lt counts still,

47:14.060 --> 47:16.900
a word is a word.

47:16.980 --> 47:19.940
Whoever climbs up is an asshole.

47:57.820 --> 47:59.420
What are you looking for?

47:59.540 --> 48:00.740
Looking for a shovel

48:02.140 --> 48:04.780
lt's made with iron, and shaped like
a knife,

48:04.900 --> 48:06.820
it's not allowed, you know?

48:06.940 --> 48:08.580
Fine, then what should l use?

48:08.700 --> 48:10.300
What do you have from your shoulders down?

48:13.420 --> 48:14.780
That's easy.

48:15.380 --> 48:16.460
Hands.

48:16.580 --> 48:18.780
Lucky that you've learnt ''lron Palm''
for a few years,

48:18.900 --> 48:20.820
or you'll have a problem.

48:39.220 --> 48:39.980
ltchy.

48:40.300 --> 48:42.100
What kind of beans are these? Poisonous?

48:45.380 --> 48:47.660
You've learnt this for a while,

48:47.780 --> 48:48.940
don't you know by now?

48:49.020 --> 48:49.940
Fry.

48:56.940 --> 48:57.900
Fry.

49:34.500 --> 49:37.980
Come back later if you haven't had enough.

49:38.100 --> 49:40.180
l live in the hut by the tea garden.

50:20.180 --> 50:21.100
Master.

50:21.180 --> 50:22.500
Still the same words.

50:22.580 --> 50:24.940
Whoever climbs up is an asshole.

51:00.500 --> 51:02.980
Hero Wan, you're my master

51:03.060 --> 51:04.140
l'm an asshole.

51:09.900 --> 51:11.980
lf he is,

51:12.100 --> 51:14.300
then l am...

51:14.380 --> 51:16.140
Oh, no!

51:16.260 --> 51:18.300
He made fun of me.

51:27.620 --> 51:28.420
Go.

51:30.660 --> 51:32.740
Brother Zhou, you have no idea,

51:32.860 --> 51:35.940
that old...man is so mean.

51:36.980 --> 51:38.100
Look.

51:53.660 --> 51:56.940
That old...man told me to go later.

51:57.500 --> 51:58.540
But l won't.

52:01.460 --> 52:02.860
lf he said so,

52:02.980 --> 52:04.100
you must go.

52:05.540 --> 52:06.500
Brother Zhou is right.

52:06.580 --> 52:08.180
Looks like you didn't

52:08.300 --> 52:09.620
learn your inner strength during the day,

52:09.740 --> 52:11.020
if you go tonight...

52:21.580 --> 52:23.620
The old man isn't kind,

52:23.740 --> 52:26.220
he put poison in the beans,

52:26.340 --> 52:28.300
if the itch wouldn't stop,

52:28.380 --> 52:29.740
l can forget about sleeping tonight.

52:32.860 --> 52:34.140
l got it, Brother Zhou.

52:40.220 --> 52:41.180
What happened to you?

52:41.660 --> 52:42.660
Oh, don't talk about it.

52:54.380 --> 52:55.980
Looks like he had suffered too.

52:56.100 --> 52:57.660
Brother Zhou, you're the best among us,

52:57.780 --> 52:59.740
you're the one who's practised
''Bell Cover''.

53:15.980 --> 53:18.300
l thought you're too lazy to show up.

53:23.380 --> 53:24.540
Master, please teach me.

53:25.580 --> 53:27.620
Shut up, start grinding.

55:07.420 --> 55:08.380
Mrs. Zu.

55:11.340 --> 55:12.220
Sit.

55:13.740 --> 55:16.780
My father said today is the first day,

55:16.900 --> 55:18.540
it must be hard for you to bear.

55:28.300 --> 55:30.140
You will need this ointment,

55:30.220 --> 55:32.420
it's my father's secret prescription,

55:32.540 --> 55:34.860
rub this on three times tonight.

55:37.980 --> 55:41.380
My father said it's a tough way to learn

55:41.460 --> 55:43.340
Bell Cover,

55:43.420 --> 55:46.380
but the training could speed up.

55:46.860 --> 55:48.780
Your foundation is good,

55:48.860 --> 55:50.740
with three months of training,

55:50.820 --> 55:53.900
your body will be strong as the stones.

55:53.980 --> 55:55.060
Thank you, Chief Wang.

56:31.020 --> 56:31.860
Master.

56:31.980 --> 56:34.260
Any movements around Tiandao Mansion
in the last week?

56:34.660 --> 56:36.740
You're sure no one left the place?

56:36.860 --> 56:37.980
No one.

56:40.900 --> 56:45.420
The Chief of Tiandao Mansion minds
his own business,

56:45.540 --> 56:47.140
he obeys all our orders,

56:47.220 --> 56:50.820
they don't have any weapons,
not even a shovel.

56:50.940 --> 56:53.540
But then you don't really need
a knife to kill.

56:54.060 --> 56:55.340
Right...

56:59.140 --> 57:01.140
l must go there.

57:12.180 --> 57:14.420
You're the highest official around here,

57:14.540 --> 57:17.340
l'm really honoured to receive you
as my guest.

57:17.460 --> 57:19.140
You have a famous place here,

57:19.260 --> 57:21.740
it's my duty to visit, as a local
official.

57:28.820 --> 57:29.700
Please.

57:38.980 --> 57:40.260
lt's a big mansion,

57:40.380 --> 57:42.180
why such a small entrance?

57:43.020 --> 57:44.980
That's because we've been ordered several

57:45.100 --> 57:48.980
times not to take in any strangers,

57:49.100 --> 57:50.580
we don't want others to come in
that easily,

57:50.700 --> 57:52.460
that's why we only use the small door.

58:00.580 --> 58:01.620
Please.

58:20.820 --> 58:22.940
What can l do for you?

58:23.020 --> 58:24.140
Chief Wang.

58:24.260 --> 58:25.740
Seven days ago,

58:25.860 --> 58:28.500
l was tracking the accomplices of
the Khan's assassins,

58:28.580 --> 58:31.660
and l saw four males and a female enter
your mansion.

58:31.780 --> 58:35.660
l've ordered my soldiers to be on guard
around here,

58:35.780 --> 58:37.540
and no one's left during these days.

58:37.660 --> 58:39.700
These four males and one female must be
still here.

58:39.820 --> 58:41.060
ls that so?

58:42.460 --> 58:44.260
l guess you must be mistaken,

58:44.380 --> 58:46.540
there are many people here,

58:46.620 --> 58:50.020
but they are all law abiding residents,

58:50.140 --> 58:51.540
they would never try to assassinate
the Khan.

58:51.620 --> 58:53.260
We don't have suspects here.

58:53.380 --> 58:54.260
Really?

58:55.860 --> 58:58.340
lf you don't believe me,
you can search here.

58:58.460 --> 59:00.180
That's not necessary.

59:00.300 --> 59:04.100
But l'd like to take a look around.

59:04.180 --> 59:05.740
Be my guest.

59:10.420 --> 59:12.740
Chief, you're a martial arts expert,

59:12.820 --> 59:14.260
well known for your ''Bell Cover'' skill.

59:14.380 --> 59:15.900
l was hoping that l could have the
chance to see it.

59:15.980 --> 59:17.140
Master Polo.

59:17.260 --> 59:20.860
l was into boxing and kicking when
l was young,

59:20.980 --> 59:22.340
as for ''Bell Cover'',

59:22.460 --> 59:26.900
that's just a rumour, you needn't
believe that.

59:27.220 --> 59:29.340
But l've seen the assassin,

59:29.460 --> 59:31.020
that he's unscathed in the fight.

59:31.140 --> 59:32.740
That's out of the ordinary.

59:43.220 --> 59:44.100
Please.

59:49.340 --> 59:50.220
Master Polo.

59:55.340 --> 59:58.660
Chief Wang, you really don't know
''Bell Cover'',

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:04.340
please show me around.

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:05.140
Of course.

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.220
Please.

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:31.820
There's a bamboo forest outside,

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:33.140
a young man is cutting up the
bamboo branches.

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:36.220
And someone's working at the stones field,

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:37.660
you want to go there?

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:39.140
lt's alright.

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:41.620
There's really not much to see there,
right?

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:42.540
Very wise, Master Polo.

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:45.900
l've been walking around, but no sight
of any woman.

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:49.100
Han women don't show their faces
in front of strangers,

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:52.340
& men won't walk into women's rooms
just like that,

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.220
we're bound by Confucianism,

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:58.140
unlike in your society.

01:01:58.460 --> 01:01:59.940
l must head back to my office,

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:04.740
and l'll visit again.

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.140
l'm very honoured, you're a high official,

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:08.500
you're always welcome.

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:53.060
He's gone?

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:55.060
Yes.

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:57.420
He's a smart man,

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.740
l'm sure he'll come back secretly.

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:01.540
We must be on guard.

01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:07.860
Chief Wang is very smart and capable,

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:09.500
and a very sharp character,

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:10.580
we must investigate in the dark,

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:12.660
We'll only attack when we've got
the proof,

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:14.700
so that the residents will be on our side.

01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:15.540
You'll...

01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:16.420
...Go back in two months' time?

01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:17.300
They will be on guard now.

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:18.100
After a while,

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:19.780
when they assume l won't be going,

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:21.540
l'll sneak in and catch them off guard,

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:23.780
then l could see the real condition.

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:25.340
Caidalu,

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:26.900
order the guards around Tiandao Mansion

01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:29.340
to leave.

01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:31.100
Yes.

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:47.940
They must still be inside.

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:48.940
Must be.

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:08.660
Master.

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.060
l've only found out the real essence

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:12.660
of the lron Palm in this month.

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:16.780
But l still don't know

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:18.260
your name, master.

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:23.580
l guessed it,

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:26.460
but l dare not to say.

01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.060
Why not?

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:34.820
l guess that fellow is No.1 in lron Palm,

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:40.140
but as a person, he's...

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.620
l dare not to say.

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:49.620
You brat.

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:50.740
What about the person?

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:52.940
l didn't say who that is?

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.940
His alias is King of lron Palm,

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.620
he's not a bad man,

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:04.940
but he loves to...spit around.

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:15.380
Not bad, kid.

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:20.820
Start grinding.

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:33.260
Until the surface is leveled,

01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:35.700
then l'll start to teach you the real
''lron Palm''

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:31.460
What are you so happy about?
Three more to go.

01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:19.500
You've learnt fast.

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:23.060
For ''Bell Cover'', the training gets worse.

01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:26.340
ln the end, there will be one or
two inches

01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:29.740
of area which isn't covered.

01:09:29.859 --> 01:09:32.060
lf you keep that area as small as
possible,

01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:33.939
you've achieved a lot.

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:36.700
Right.

01:09:36.779 --> 01:09:40.140
Your waist, four inches around it.

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:41.300
You must work on it.

01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:10.100
You've improved a lot.

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:13.580
Except we don't have much time,
you could be better.

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:15.100
We could keep on practising.

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:17.940
But l fear that the tartars won't let you.

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.940
And besides, that Marco Polo

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:21.860
has his doubts about us.

01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:24.500
l think that Marco Polo guy

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:27.180
actually pities us,

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:28.580
he's different from the Mongolian.

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:31.580
Even so, he's working for them,

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:33.980
he doesn't have a choice.

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:36.940
We'll take one day at a time,

01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:38.940
let's hope that they'll take action later.

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.620
And l hope you can master the skills.

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:42.940
then we can prepare for it.

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:46.580
But...

01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:54.340
Send a royal decree to Marco Polo.

01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:57.660
Tell him to take care of the case
regarding

01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:59.900
the assassination attempt
as soon as possible.

01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:00.620
Yes, Khan.

01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:11.900
l've been ordered by the Khan

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:16.500
to take care of Tiandao Mansion
as soon as possible.

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.580
l've told you the plan,

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:22.020
you all understand?

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:24.940
Master Polo,

01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:27.580
you said you'll go alone tonight,

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.500
and we'll lead the troops in tomorrow.

01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:30.340
Correct.

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:31.980
lt's been three months

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:33.340
since my last visit,

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:36.700
they wouldn't expect me to sneak
in tonight.

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:40.740
l think l'll uncover their secrets
this round.

01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:41.940
All in one go!

01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:45.340
l'm sure you're right, Master Polo.

01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:15.900
That's not something an ordinary person
could do,

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.740
one's will determines one's strength.

01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:41.940
Ready.

01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.180
Chief, again.

01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:02.820
Jian, it's been a hundred days
since your death.

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:06.980
l wanted to follow you, but

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:11.260
l just wanted to serve my father for a
few more days.

01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:22.100
Here l come, Jian.

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:24.340
Stop.

01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:39.140
l'm joining my husband.

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:51.780
l can tell you that,

01:15:52.980 --> 01:16:01.740
you're a good man.

01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:17.340
Put her down.

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:27.980
You...were standing right outside?

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:30.180
You knew she's going to commit suicide,

01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:34.820
she's your daughter, why didn't you
stop her?

01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:38.220
Her husband's dead from the
assassination attempt.

01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:39.780
Killing herself to join her late husband

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:42.820
is a loyal, virtuous thing to do,

01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:44.500
why should l stop her?

01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:46.260
l don't understand,

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:47.020
why do you insist in

01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:48.820
something impossible?

01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:58.700
Where are you from?

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:04.500
Venice, ltaly.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.660
The Mongolian Empire covers Asia
and Europe,

01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:10.380
and Venice is not that far away.

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:13.740
lf your country is being invaded by
the Mongolians,

01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:16.620
and they run your country tyrannically,

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:18.700
will you surrender or resist?

01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:19.780
Resist, of course.

01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:21.460
That's what we're doing.

01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:23.860
But you won't succeed.

01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:25.140
lf we don't,

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:27.700
our next generation will continue.

01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:29.380
Should they fail,

01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:32.180
our future generations will continue

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.540
our legacy.

01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:37.340
We will succeed someday.

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:39.660
lf you choose to be a slave because you
might fail,

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.740
then you will fail forever.

01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:50.740
Take your time, Master Polo.

01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:55.180
What time is it?

01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:56.300
Just past 3 am.

01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:05.060
Chief Wang, you should leave.

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.060
The Mongolian troops

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:07.940
will attack at dawn.

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:13.740
Are you sure about staying?

01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:14.460
Our job here...

01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:16.660
is to get even for Brother Zu and
Brother Jin. We've to

01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:19.100
let the tartar king know that we're
not to be bullied.

01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:20.300
You're all warriors,

01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:21.540
just like those two.

01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:22.500
Tell us,

01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:24.420
how did they die?

01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:13.500
Caidalu's ''Big Palm'',

01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:15.420
l think you can counter that with

01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:16.660
your ''lron Palm''.

01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:21.940
For Dulidan's skills,

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:23.740
you with your jumping skills.

01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:24.620
Qinggong.

01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:25.740
That's right.

01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:28.620
l think

01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:30.260
your ''Bell Cover''

01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:32.540
can take care of Abulahua's Double Blades.

01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:33.780
But beware,

01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:35.940
there will be more than those three,

01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.740
they will bring troops.

01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:40.780
Just let me get out of here,

01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:42.180
maybe l could stop them in time.

01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:43.100
No.

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:45.860
Brother Huang will be defending
the entrance.

01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:49.300
His force could destroy the whole place,

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:51.380
and he wouldn't let the troops in.

01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:55.100
We'll let Chief Wang and the others
leave first,

01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:56.140
and we'll stay behind

01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:57.540
for them.

01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:58.700
Khan.

01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:08.460
l won't go back to him,

01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:10.380
l'll leave China.

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:18.980
Sorry about this, Master Polo.

01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:24.980
l suggested

01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:26.380
their attack plan.

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:42.780
lt doesn't seem right, Dulidan.

01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:48.940
Stay here,

01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:50.020
we'll go in.

01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:49.460
Master Polo.

01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:03.860
Shoot.

01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:15.580
You wouldn't dare to hurt the
lmperial lnspector.

01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:17.420
As long as you won't involve the troops,

01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:18.780
just one on one,

01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:20.460
then l'll let the foreigner go.

01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:21.340
Deal.

01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:22.860
Back off everyone.

01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:26.700
The Mongolians won't take pride in
winning by numbers.

01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:16.060
We outnumber them. Charge!

01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:19.580
Charge...

01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:35.780
Shoot.

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:40.660
Go...!

01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:42.340
Go...!

01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:55.940
Go...!

01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:19.100
One against so many!

01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:24.780
That was fun!
