<i>no intention of marrying them.</i>
<i>Happy to waste your time.</i>

19:39.553 --> 19:42.931
<i>I feel that if you have an agreement,</i>
<i>if you've been honest, you're like,</i>

19:43.015 --> 19:45.517
<i>"I never want to see you naked,</i>
<i>and I'm not into it,"</i>

19:45.601 --> 19:48.270

19:50.063 --> 19:52.232
<i>As long as you're honest, that's fair.</i>

19:52.316 --> 19:54.776

<i>you get super drunk.</i>
