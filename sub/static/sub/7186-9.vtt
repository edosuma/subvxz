00:11.045 --> 00:12.277
- Yo-ho!

00:12.279 --> 00:14.513
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:14.515 --> 00:15.948

- Yo-ho!

00:18.786 --> 00:20.586

- Let's go!

00:20.588 --> 00:23.789

<i>¶ Join with Jake</i>

00:30.064 --> 00:33.032
<i>¶ Come along</i>
<i>We need some volunteers ¶</i>

00:33.034 --> 00:34.767
-  <i>Jake!</i>
<i>- Ahoy!</i>

00:34.769 --> 00:36.301

<i>- Ahoy!</i>

00:36.303 --> 00:37.836

Let's go!

00:50.618 --> 00:52.618

00:52.620 --> 00:54.887
<i>¶ We'll set the course</i>

00:58.959 --> 01:00.692
Ha-har!

01:01.761 --> 01:03.262
Ahoy, mateys!

01:03.264 --> 01:06.031
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:07.333 --> 01:08.567
Great!

01:08.569 --> 01:10.035
To start today's adventure,

01:10.037 --> 01:12.805
everybody say
the pirate password.

01:12.807 --> 01:14.306
Yo-ho-ho!

01:14.308 --> 01:16.308
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:16.310 --> 01:18.043
One more time.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.112
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:23.283 --> 01:25.951
<i>[Jake]</i> The Mermaid's Song!

01:25.953 --> 01:27.319
[Skully] Fancy crackers!

01:27.321 --> 01:29.321
[whooping]

01:29.323 --> 01:31.256
So, when's the
big party, Marina?

01:31.258 --> 01:33.692
This is more than
just a party, Skully.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.295
Tomorrow is the
Treasure of the Tide ceremony.

01:36.297 --> 01:40.699
Oh! That's the most important
day of the year for mermaids.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.869
It's when they give
a special honor to
one of their own.

01:43.871 --> 01:46.605
But there's so much to do
to get ready in time.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.207
We'll help ya!

01:48.209 --> 01:50.709
Remember to keep a look out
for gold doubloons.

01:50.711 --> 01:54.213
Whenever we solve a
pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

01:54.215 --> 01:57.783
Then we'll collect 'em
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.952
Is everybody ready?

01:59.954 --> 02:02.688
- I've got my sword.
- I got my map!

02:02.690 --> 02:05.023
And I've got
my pixie dust.

02:05.025 --> 02:08.627
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.096
But only in emergencies.

02:13.166 --> 02:16.668
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

02:16.670 --> 02:18.804
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

02:18.806 --> 02:20.172
Let's go!

02:20.174 --> 02:23.709
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

02:23.711 --> 02:26.645

<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

02:26.647 --> 02:28.714
<i>¶ And me </i>

02:31.417 --> 02:34.086
Helpin' mermaids
is always fun!

02:34.088 --> 02:35.721
Not always!

02:35.723 --> 02:38.323
[sighs]
Stringing pearls isn't easy.

02:38.325 --> 02:41.827
I'm not sure my little sister
thinks helping out is much fun.

02:41.829 --> 02:44.663
Humph.
I'd rather go surfing.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.666
You can go surfing
after you help us, Stormy.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.768
Right now I have to
swim to Buccaneer Bay

02:49.770 --> 02:52.704
and get special oil
to light the lamps
for the ceremony.

02:52.706 --> 02:56.074
While I'm gone,
I need you to do
three mer-tasks.

02:56.076 --> 02:59.278
One, collect seashells
for decorations.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.414
Two, fill a basket with
seaweed to make a salad.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.950
And three, gather
coconuts for dessert.

03:04.952 --> 03:09.788
[sighs] OK, I'll do it, but
I'd still rather go surfing.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.857
Marina,
while you're gone,

03:11.859 --> 03:13.825
we're going to make
musical instruments.

03:13.827 --> 03:16.795
Perfect!
You pirates are the best!

03:16.797 --> 03:19.831
Remember Stormy,
I'm counting on you!

03:21.134 --> 03:22.701
Bye-bye, everybody!

03:22.703 --> 03:25.470
Bye Marina!
See you later, Stormy.

03:25.472 --> 03:28.373
Bye now.
Hope you have fun.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.710
[sighs] Mer-task number one,

03:31.712 --> 03:34.980
gather pretty seashells
for decorations.

03:37.317 --> 03:40.285
Oh! There's a
really pretty one!

03:40.287 --> 03:42.788
[burbling]

03:42.790 --> 03:45.791
Oh, it's you, Snappy! Hi.

03:45.793 --> 03:49.461
- [burbles]
- Snappy, I have to collect
a bunch of seashells.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.497
- Wanna come along?
- [burbles]

03:52.499 --> 03:54.466
[Hook] Blast!

03:54.468 --> 03:58.303
Why must treasure maps
be so confusing?

03:58.305 --> 04:01.907
Look, Snappy! It's that
funny Captain Hook.

04:01.909 --> 04:05.310
[giggles] I wish he would
find seashells for me.

04:05.312 --> 04:07.512
Then I'd have more time
to go surfing.

04:07.514 --> 04:09.915
Hey, that
gives me an idea!

04:09.917 --> 04:12.050
Have you ever heard of
the Mermaid's Song?

04:12.052 --> 04:13.919
[burbles]

04:13.921 --> 04:16.455
Well, when somebody
hears the Mermaid's Song,

04:16.457 --> 04:19.858
they have to do whatever
the mermaid asks them to do!

04:19.860 --> 04:23.128
Cover your ears
and watch this!

04:23.130 --> 04:26.331
<i>¶ Listen to</i>
<i>my song of the sea ¶</i>

04:26.333 --> 04:30.769

<i>pretty seashells for me? ¶</i>

04:30.771 --> 04:34.239
<i>¶ Come collect</i>
<i>pretty seashells for me ¶</i>

04:34.241 --> 04:39.077
It works! Captain Hook
is under the spell
of the Mermaid Song.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.780
Now he'll do
whatever I tell him!

04:41.782 --> 04:43.882
- [burbles] Uh-oh.
- Captain Hook,

04:43.884 --> 04:46.952
take this bag and collect
pretty seashells, please!

04:46.954 --> 04:50.389
Must collect...
seashells!

04:50.391 --> 04:54.259
Must collect...
seashells.

04:54.261 --> 04:55.861
Goody goldfish!

04:55.863 --> 04:58.497
Mer-task number one
is getting done!

04:58.499 --> 05:00.866
Now I can do my
second mer-task...

05:00.868 --> 05:03.268
Humph. Pick seaweed.

05:03.270 --> 05:07.439
[sigh] But maybe I can find
someone else to help me out.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.875
[rustling]

05:09.877 --> 05:11.543
[Smee] Oh, Cap'n Hook!

05:11.545 --> 05:16.248
Oh, cap'n, my cap'n,
where ever did you go?

05:16.250 --> 05:18.917
Mr. Smee gives me
another idea.

05:18.919 --> 05:22.187
<i>¶ Listen to</i>
<i>my song of the sea ¶</i>

05:22.189 --> 05:26.425
<i>¶ Won't someone pick</i>
<i>some seaweed for me? ¶</i>

05:26.427 --> 05:29.961
<i>¶ Come and pick</i>
<i>seaweed for me ¶</i>

05:31.364 --> 05:33.498
[giggles] Mr. Smee?

05:33.500 --> 05:36.868
Please pick lots of seaweed
and put it in this basket!

05:36.870 --> 05:39.271
Must pick...
seaweed.

05:39.273 --> 05:42.941
Must pick...
seaweed.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.077
The Mermaid's Song
worked again!

05:45.079 --> 05:47.212
[burbling]

05:47.214 --> 05:51.450
Now all I have to do
is... collect coconuts!

05:51.452 --> 05:53.452
[sighing]

05:53.454 --> 05:55.420
Hey, it's Cubby!

05:55.422 --> 05:58.090
I bet you I can
get him to help me too!

05:58.092 --> 06:03.662
After all, he did say
helping mermaids
is always fun!

06:03.664 --> 06:06.531
[burbles]

06:06.533 --> 06:09.901
<i>¶ Listen to</i>
<i>my song of the sea ¶</i>

06:14.408 --> 06:17.876
<i>¶ Come gather</i>

06:19.345 --> 06:22.047
Cubby! I'd like you
to gather coconuts!

06:22.049 --> 06:25.150
Lots and lots!
Just pile 'em up anywhere!

06:25.152 --> 06:28.954
Must gather...
coconuts.

Must gather...
coconuts.

seashells.

06:35.662 --> 06:38.296
Must gather...
coconuts.

06:38.298 --> 06:41.099
Must pick...
seaweed.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.935
Happy waves!
That was easy!

06:43.937 --> 06:46.271
All my mer-tasks
are getting done.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.973
You know what that
means, Snappy?

06:47.975 --> 06:51.243
We can go surfing!
Mermaid-abunga!

06:51.245 --> 06:52.944
[burbles]

06:55.615 --> 07:01.453
- This vine guitar rocks!
- Shake, rattle and shake!

07:01.455 --> 07:05.190
Hey! Cubby didn't finish
his drum! Where'd he go?

07:05.192 --> 07:07.993
Well, I'm not sure.
Let's go find him!

07:08.461 --> 07:11.696
- Oh, Cubby!
- Cubby!

07:11.698 --> 07:14.332
Mateys, spy that!

07:14.334 --> 07:18.537
Must collect...
seashells.

07:18.539 --> 07:21.673
Must collect...
seashells.

07:21.675 --> 07:24.976
Careful, captain!
You might fall!

07:24.978 --> 07:28.013
Shiver me timbers!
What's wrong with
Captain Hook?

07:28.015 --> 07:31.650
For a goofy guy,
he's acting even
goofier than usual!

07:31.652 --> 07:33.685
Maybe!
But we got to help him!

07:33.687 --> 07:37.722
Mateys! Let's put this
big sea sponge under Hook!

07:37.724 --> 07:41.026
When he falls, he'll
land on something soft!

07:41.961 --> 07:43.328
[exclaims]

07:45.031 --> 07:50.035
Captain Hook,
are you OK? Hello!

07:50.037 --> 07:52.304
[sputtering] What?!

07:52.306 --> 07:56.575
Thundering blunderbuss!
What am I doing here?!

07:56.577 --> 07:58.677
We saved old Feather Hat!

07:58.679 --> 08:01.146
And we got
three gold doubloons!

08:01.148 --> 08:05.083
Let's grab 'em and go see
what's up with Captain Hook!

08:05.085 --> 08:09.054
Look alive! Mr. Smee is
about to wake up the octopus!

08:09.056 --> 08:11.256
Must pick...
seaweed!

08:11.258 --> 08:14.426
- [burbling]
- Must pick... seaweed!

08:14.428 --> 08:18.096
Tell him to unhand
me first mate!

08:18.098 --> 08:20.632
[both hollering]

08:20.634 --> 08:23.034
Yo-ho, Mr. Octopus!

08:23.036 --> 08:25.170
Sure is a lot more fun
juggling this stuff

08:25.172 --> 08:28.073
than a couple of
salty ol' pirates.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.341
Wanna give it a try?

08:29.343 --> 08:31.142
[both yelping]

08:31.144 --> 08:32.511
Here you go!

08:32.513 --> 08:34.346
- [yelling]
- [crashing]

08:34.348 --> 08:35.747
[Jake] All right!

08:35.749 --> 08:38.517
We rescued Hook and Smee
from the Octopus

08:38.519 --> 08:41.219
and got three more
gold doubloons!

08:41.221 --> 08:44.356
Let's grab 'em
and go figure out
what's going on here!

08:46.058 --> 08:49.094
- Must pick... seaweed.
- Mr. Smee, are you OK?

08:49.096 --> 08:51.496
Mr. Smee?
[claps]

08:51.498 --> 08:53.365
[sputtering] Where am I?

08:53.367 --> 08:56.334
What in plunder
is going on?

08:56.336 --> 08:59.070
Matey alert!
Cubby's in trouble!

08:59.072 --> 09:02.240
Must gather...
coconuts.

09:02.242 --> 09:05.143
Must gather...
coconuts.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.612
- [rumbling]
- Izzy! This
is an emergency!

09:07.614 --> 09:11.116
Then it's...
pixie dust away!

09:12.585 --> 09:15.387
Must gather...
coconuts.

09:15.389 --> 09:19.090
All right!
We kept the coconuts
from falling on Cubby

09:19.092 --> 09:21.793
and got four more
gold doubloons!

09:21.795 --> 09:24.095
Let's grab 'em and go!

09:24.630 --> 09:27.666
Must gather...
coconuts.

09:27.668 --> 09:31.136
Yay-hey, no way!
What's wrong with Cubby?

09:31.138 --> 09:33.138
I think I know!

09:33.140 --> 09:35.340
Marina!
Cubby's in trouble!

09:35.342 --> 09:37.108
He's in some
kind of a daze.

09:37.110 --> 09:40.712
- Just like you said Snappy.
- [burbling in agreement]

09:40.714 --> 09:43.281
Cubby is under the spell
of the Mermaid's Song!

09:43.283 --> 09:47.152
When someone hears it,
they must do whatever
they're asked!

09:47.154 --> 09:51.356
The only way to break
the spell is to clap...
like this!

09:51.358 --> 09:53.224
- [claps]
- [gasps]

09:53.226 --> 09:55.594
Ah, coconuts.
What happened?

09:55.596 --> 09:58.430
You were under the spell
of the Mermaid's Song!

09:58.432 --> 10:01.099
That's why you were
gathering coconuts!

10:01.101 --> 10:03.768
And why I was
picking seaweed.

10:03.770 --> 10:07.305
And why I was
collecting seashells!

10:07.307 --> 10:10.175
Now the important
question is...

10:10.177 --> 10:15.447
who, as in which mermaid,
would ask us to do such things?

10:15.449 --> 10:17.415
[sighs] Stormy.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.284
Did somebody call me?

10:19.286 --> 10:21.186
Uh-oh.

10:21.188 --> 10:23.788
I know you didn't
mean any harm, Stormy,

10:23.790 --> 10:28.526
but the captain, Mr. Smee
and Cubby almost got
into big trouble.

10:28.528 --> 10:32.163
I didn't think that
would happen. I'm so sorry.

10:32.165 --> 10:36.401
Remember, the Mermaid's Song
should be used to help others,

10:36.403 --> 10:39.237
it should never
be used selfishly!

10:39.239 --> 10:42.807
Don't worry, Marina!
I won't forget. Promise!

10:42.809 --> 10:46.778
See that it never
happens again! Come, Smee!

10:46.780 --> 10:50.782
Let us take leave of these
"enchanting" mermaids!

10:50.784 --> 10:54.319
Um... Can we still be friends?

10:54.321 --> 10:55.687
- Aye!
- Sure.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.922
- Of course!
- Crackers, yeah!

10:57.924 --> 10:59.257
- Bye!
- So long!

10:59.259 --> 11:00.959
- See ya!
- Catch you later!

11:00.961 --> 11:02.527
[giggling]

11:03.896 --> 11:05.797
Thanks for helping
the mermaids get ready

11:05.799 --> 11:08.767
for the Treasure of
the Tides ceremony, mateys!

11:08.769 --> 11:12.671
Now let's put all
our gold doubloons into
our Team Treasure Chest.

11:19.912 --> 11:22.180
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:22.182 --> 11:24.215
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:24.217 --> 11:26.251
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

11:26.253 --> 11:28.953
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons! ¶</i>

11:28.955 --> 11:31.456
Come on. Count with us.

11:32.291 --> 11:34.225
[all] Yeah!

11:35.795 --> 11:38.363
[Cubby] One, two, three...

11:38.365 --> 11:40.765
[Jake] Four, five, six...

11:40.767 --> 11:44.269
[Izzy] Seven, eight, nine, ten.

11:44.271 --> 11:47.338
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today

11:47.340 --> 11:50.341
we got ten gold doubloons!

11:50.343 --> 11:52.744
We also got
lots of coconuts.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.946
Way too many!

11:57.717 --> 12:01.052
<i>¶ Listen to my</i>
<i>song of the sea ¶</i>

12:01.054 --> 12:05.323
<i>¶ Captain Hook</i>
<i>Swab the deck for me! ¶</i>

12:05.325 --> 12:08.960
<i>¶ Won't you swab the deck</i>
<i>if you please ¶</i>

12:08.962 --> 12:12.564
[Hook] Must swab decks...

12:16.268 --> 12:18.970
<i>[Jake]</i> Treasure of the Tides.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.005
[all] Go Izzy, go!

12:21.007 --> 12:24.642
- Look at her swim!
- She's as fast as Lucille!

12:24.644 --> 12:28.012
[Lucille barking]

12:30.015 --> 12:34.452
Marina, the tail
you and Stormy made
for me is perfect!

12:34.454 --> 12:37.322
We thought it would
help you feel more
like a mermaid!

12:37.324 --> 12:38.823
And now you can
swim with us

12:38.825 --> 12:40.992
to the Treasure of the Tides
ceremony tonight!

12:40.994 --> 12:44.562
The Mermaids are planning
some sort of ceremony.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.331
With treasure!

12:46.333 --> 12:49.000
Aye, cap'n.
It sounds lovely.

12:49.002 --> 12:52.904
Shh. We must learn
more about this ceremony.

12:52.906 --> 12:56.007
Where it is. And when!

12:56.009 --> 12:58.309
So Stormy, which
of the mermaids

12:58.311 --> 12:59.778
is going to be
honored this year?

12:59.780 --> 13:02.714
We can't tell you, Jake!
It's a surprise.

13:02.716 --> 13:06.584
You'll just have to
wait until tonight
over at Hidden Cove.

13:06.586 --> 13:09.354
All will be revealed
at the turn of the tides.

13:09.356 --> 13:14.058
OK, then. We'll start
hiking to Hidden Cove
and meet you at sunset.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.761
Jake, thanks for taking
care of my pixie dust

13:16.763 --> 13:21.065
while I swim with the Mermaids.
It's no good if it gets wet.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.968
Sure thing, Izz.
I'll be careful.

13:23.970 --> 13:27.472
And remember,
pixie dust is only for...

13:27.474 --> 13:31.309
[all] Emergencies!
We know!

13:31.311 --> 13:33.978
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

13:33.980 --> 13:36.881
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

13:36.883 --> 13:41.586
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

13:41.588 --> 13:44.422
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

13:44.424 --> 13:46.558
<i>¶ And me </i>

13:48.961 --> 13:52.931
Mr. Smee! We have
to get to Hidden Cove

13:52.933 --> 13:56.835
to find the
Treasure of the Tides...
whatever it is.

13:56.837 --> 13:59.003
Whatever it is, indeed.

13:59.005 --> 14:02.073
And the good news is
that little busy Izzy

14:02.075 --> 14:06.678
doesn't have pixie dust
to help her out!
So step lively!

14:06.680 --> 14:11.583
- Stepping lively, cap'n!
- [yelling]

14:11.585 --> 14:13.084
[all] Captain Hook?!

14:13.086 --> 14:14.919
What's he doing here?

14:14.921 --> 14:17.055
Let me find out
what he's up to.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.389
Captain Hook?

14:18.391 --> 14:21.392
Are you spying so
you can try to steal

14:21.394 --> 14:23.428
the Treasure of the Tides?

14:23.430 --> 14:26.764
I'll do more than
try, puny pirate!

14:26.766 --> 14:30.768
I'll beat you and
your fishy friends
to Hidden Cove

14:30.770 --> 14:34.539
and claim the mermaid's
treasure for me own!

14:34.541 --> 14:36.608
[laughs]

14:36.610 --> 14:39.677
Mateys, will you help
us stop Captain Hook

14:39.679 --> 14:42.547
from ruining the Treasure
of the Tides ceremony?

14:44.049 --> 14:48.486
Thanks! Remember to keep
a lookout for gold doubloons.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.823
Whenever we solve a
pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

14:51.825 --> 14:55.159
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

14:55.161 --> 14:57.395
Yo-ho, let's go!

14:57.397 --> 15:00.064
Ta-ta, mermaids!

15:00.066 --> 15:02.467
I don't think so,
Captain Hook.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.903
We can swim faster
than you can row!

15:04.905 --> 15:07.972
Perhaps... but you
won't be swimming far

15:07.974 --> 15:10.942
if you can't get out
of your little lagoon!

15:10.944 --> 15:13.611
[trumpeting]

15:13.613 --> 15:16.948
Ah! Shiver me ears!

15:16.950 --> 15:19.450
And shiver me timbers!

15:19.452 --> 15:23.054
Ahoy, pretty fish ladies!

15:23.056 --> 15:27.125
Yay-hey, no way!
The    <i>Jolly Roger's</i>
<i>blocking the lagoon!</i>

15:27.127 --> 15:31.629
- We need to move that ship!
- [barking]

15:31.631 --> 15:33.064
Good idea, Lucille!

15:33.066 --> 15:35.199
Go fetch our friends,
the Blue Whales.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.703
Sorry,
me little fish filets,

15:38.705 --> 15:41.539
but Cap'n Hook told us
to block the lagoon.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.174
- [barking]
- [yelling]

15:46.979 --> 15:49.213
She made it!
Good girl!

15:49.215 --> 15:52.183
That tricky seal
is slippery!

15:52.185 --> 15:54.485
And fast on
her flippers, too!

15:54.487 --> 15:56.087
Great galleons!

15:56.089 --> 16:00.925
- [barking]
- [Bones] We're in for
a whale of a time now!

16:00.927 --> 16:03.561
[whales grunting]

16:05.230 --> 16:08.566
- Thanks, Lucille.
- Thank you, too, Blue Whales!

16:08.568 --> 16:10.134
[whales trumpeting]

16:10.136 --> 16:11.803
[both] Oh!

16:12.738 --> 16:15.873
Yay-hey! We got
out of the lagoon

16:15.875 --> 16:18.076
and we got three
gold doubloons!

16:18.078 --> 16:20.979
Let's grab 'em and go
catch up to Captain Hook!

16:24.116 --> 16:26.484
Hold fast there, Smee.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.520
I'll see how far
it is to Hidden Cove.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.622
Aye-aye, cap'n!

16:33.659 --> 16:35.593
[whinnying]

16:35.595 --> 16:37.829
Oh, hello there,
little fella.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.098
Would you like
a bit of a biscuit?

16:40.100 --> 16:44.535
- [whinnying]
- Oh! Oh, dear...

16:46.005 --> 16:48.506
[Hook] Barnacles
and bilge water!

16:48.508 --> 16:50.975
Go. Shoo, now!
Off with ya.

16:50.977 --> 16:54.278
The mermaids have
somehow escaped the lagoon.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.147
Full speed ahead!

16:56.149 --> 16:58.783
I'm afraid we
can't budge, cap'n!

16:58.785 --> 17:01.185
What in plunder
are those?

17:01.187 --> 17:04.288
They're sweet little
seahorses, cap'n.

17:04.290 --> 17:07.725
Easily spooked they are,
so be nice and...

17:07.727 --> 17:11.763
Easily spooked,
are they? Excellent!

17:11.765 --> 17:16.934
I'll just turn our problem
into the mermaids' problem.

17:16.936 --> 17:19.137
[trumpeting]

17:23.242 --> 17:25.143
Oh, sea sludge!

17:25.145 --> 17:27.545
That sneaky snook,
Hook is up ahead.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.080
That's not all!

17:29.082 --> 17:31.783
- [whinnying]
- [Izzy] It's a
seahorse stampede!

17:31.785 --> 17:34.152
We need to
calm them down!

17:34.154 --> 17:36.220
I know how! Quick everybody!

17:36.222 --> 17:38.322
Let's sing them a lullaby!

17:38.324 --> 17:43.127
<i>¶ Quietly, slowly</i>
<i>Seahorses shhh ¶</i>

17:43.129 --> 17:48.199
<i>¶ Quietly, slowly</i>
<i>Seahorses shhh ¶</i>

17:48.201 --> 17:51.302
All right! We calmed
down the seahorses,

17:51.304 --> 17:54.839
and we got three more
gold doubloons!

17:54.841 --> 17:57.842
Let's grab 'em and go
catch up to Captain Hook!

18:00.746 --> 18:03.381
[grunts] Ah, coconuts!

18:03.383 --> 18:05.283
No wonder Hidden Cove
is so hidden.

18:05.285 --> 18:08.086
Guess I'm lucky.
I can fly!

18:08.088 --> 18:12.824
Hey, so can we...
with a pinch of pixie dust!

18:12.826 --> 18:14.926
Jake...?

18:14.928 --> 18:16.661
[laughing]
I don't think so, Cubby.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.596
This is no emergency.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.632
Oh well, can't blame
a matey for trying.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.304
Hurry, Mr. Smee!
Row faster!

18:26.306 --> 18:28.372
Hook's going to
beat us to Hidden Cove!

18:28.374 --> 18:31.075
Don't worry.
We've got until
the tide turns

18:31.077 --> 18:33.277
before the
Treasure of the Tides
is revealed.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.113
We'll be there to stop Hook!

18:35.115 --> 18:38.249
And we'll get there
in two shakes of a
mermaid's tail!

18:38.884 --> 18:40.384
Look sharp, Mr. Smee.

18:40.386 --> 18:44.255
The Treasure of the Tides
is around here somewhere.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.790
I know, cap'n.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.126
That lovely mermaid Marina said,

18:48.128 --> 18:52.196
"All will be revealed
at the turn of the tide."

18:52.198 --> 18:55.833
You know, that's when
the water moves away
from the shore and...

18:55.835 --> 18:59.337
Look, cap'n! There!
Rising out of the water!

18:59.339 --> 19:01.339
[Hook gasps]

19:01.341 --> 19:05.376
Smee, the Treasure
of the Tides is...

19:05.378 --> 19:08.045
...a golden throne!

19:08.047 --> 19:10.648
And it's all mine!

19:10.650 --> 19:13.718
Well, maybe not...
Here come the mermaids!

19:13.720 --> 19:16.354
Ha! What care I?

19:16.356 --> 19:19.056
They're no match
for Captain Hook.

19:19.058 --> 19:23.227
And remember, fish-tail Izzy
doesn't have her pixie dust!

19:23.229 --> 19:28.900
Which means, no flying
puny pirates or mermaids today!

19:28.902 --> 19:32.069
[gasps] Scaly tails!
There they are!

19:32.071 --> 19:34.205
Ah! Quickly now!

19:34.207 --> 19:37.275
Pry the throne
from the rock!

19:37.277 --> 19:40.845
[grunting]
Prying, cap'n!

19:40.847 --> 19:43.381
Yay-hey, no way,
Captain Hook!

19:43.383 --> 19:46.083
Oh, you won't get away
with this, Hook!

19:46.085 --> 19:47.818
Oh, yes I will!

19:47.820 --> 19:51.856
Because someone,
pretending to be a mermaid,

19:51.858 --> 19:55.059
gave away her pixie dust. Ha!

19:55.061 --> 19:58.462
And there's none to be
found for miles around!

19:58.464 --> 20:00.198
[Jake] That's what
you think, Hook!

20:00.200 --> 20:01.432
[Hook] Jake?

20:01.434 --> 20:04.435
Now this is an
emergency, Cubby.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.237
Izzy! Catch!

20:08.106 --> 20:10.741
Pixie dust away!

20:14.446 --> 20:17.081
Thanks, Jake!

20:17.083 --> 20:19.717
I hope you brought
your bathing suit, Hook,

20:19.719 --> 20:22.453
'cause you're gonna get
more than a little wet!

20:22.455 --> 20:24.355
- Yee-haw!
- [mermaids giggling]

20:24.357 --> 20:26.390
[Smee straining]

20:26.392 --> 20:29.093
I'm losing
my grip, cap'n!

20:29.095 --> 20:32.296
Hold... fast, Smee!

20:32.298 --> 20:36.500
- [Smee] Oh dear!
- [Hook yelling]

20:38.270 --> 20:40.304
[all cheering]

20:40.306 --> 20:43.307
We saved the
Mermaid Queen's throne,

20:43.309 --> 20:46.177
and we got four more
gold doubloons!

20:46.179 --> 20:50.481
Let's grab 'em and
go start the Treasure
of the Tides ceremony!

20:52.484 --> 20:53.818
[humming]

20:53.820 --> 20:56.187
Once a year,
we gather to honor

20:56.189 --> 20:58.089
one among us who
best represents

20:58.091 --> 21:00.524
kindness to all
sea creatures,

21:00.526 --> 21:02.560
courage in
times of trouble,

21:02.562 --> 21:04.996
and friendship
with her sisters.

21:04.998 --> 21:09.834
To this Special One,
we give this symbol
of our love and respect.

21:09.836 --> 21:13.838
- Me? But, I'm not...
- Yes you are, Izzy.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.841
Starting today,
you're an honorary mermaid!

21:16.843 --> 21:20.811
There's more to being a mermaid
than just having a tail.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.514
[Cubby] Way to go, Izzy!

21:23.516 --> 21:25.316
[all] Yeah!

21:25.318 --> 21:28.953
<i>¶ When the tide has turned</i>
<i>please celebrate ¶</i>

21:28.955 --> 21:31.555

21:40.433 --> 21:42.433
- All right!
- Awesome!

21:42.435 --> 21:43.934
Crackers!

21:46.104 --> 21:47.438
Thanks for
helping us celebrate

21:47.440 --> 21:50.141
the Treasure of the Tides
ceremony, mateys!

21:50.143 --> 21:54.845
Now let's put all our
gold doubloons into our
Team Treasure Chest!

22:01.987 --> 22:04.255
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

22:04.257 --> 22:06.290
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

22:06.292 --> 22:08.326
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

22:08.328 --> 22:11.195
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons! ¶</i>

22:11.197 --> 22:13.564
Come on. Count with us.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.267
[all] Yeah!

22:17.536 --> 22:20.304
[Izzy] One, two, three...

22:20.306 --> 22:22.506
[Cubby] Four, five, six...

22:22.508 --> 22:26.277
[Jake] Seven, eight, nine, ten!

22:26.279 --> 22:29.313
Yo, ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

22:29.315 --> 22:32.516
we got ten gold doubloons.

22:32.518 --> 22:36.520
And I've got something
for you, me mer-mates!

22:36.522 --> 22:40.157
Kelp crowns for being
the best mateys ever!

22:40.159 --> 22:41.926
- Cool.
- Awesome!

22:41.928 --> 22:43.994
Oyster crackers!

22:46.298 --> 22:50.301
[sighs] The Golden Throne
was within my grasp, Smee.

22:50.303 --> 22:55.306
And once again,
we're rowin' home,
empty-hooked.

22:55.308 --> 22:58.976
Oh, tut, cap'n.
Look on the bright side.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.945
At least we're not sinking.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.681
[both shouting]

23:03.683 --> 23:06.951
You had to say it,
didn't you?

23:07.652 --> 23:09.553
[upbeat music playing]

23:09.555 --> 23:13.224
<i>¶ There be treasure</i>
<i>at the end of the rainbow ¶</i>

23:13.226 --> 23:15.526
<i>¶ Treasure at the end</i>
<i>of the rainbow ¶</i>

23:15.528 --> 23:18.462
<i>¶ Where did all the clouds</i>
<i>and the rain go? ¶</i>

23:18.464 --> 23:21.298
<i>¶ The sunshine turned</i>
<i>into a rainbow ¶</i>

23:21.300 --> 23:24.402
<i>¶ All the pretty colors</i>
<i>are bright and bold ¶</i>

23:24.404 --> 23:28.639
<i>¶ Do they really hit</i>
<i>that buried gold? ¶</i>

23:28.641 --> 23:31.442
<i>¶ Red, orange, yellow</i>
<i>green and blue ¶</i>

23:31.444 --> 23:33.944
<i>¶ Don't forget</i>
<i>indigo and violet, too ¶</i>

23:33.946 --> 23:36.981
<i>¶ I forgot them colors</i>
<i>so thank you ¶</i>

23:36.983 --> 23:39.550
<i>¶ That's why we're singing</i>
<i>a rainbow tune ¶</i>

23:39.552 --> 23:42.653
<i>¶ The rain's all gone</i>
<i>but the bow's still there ¶</i>

23:42.655 --> 23:46.524
<i>¶ The sky's full of colors</i>
<i>hangin' in mid-air ¶</i>

23:46.526 --> 23:49.260
<i>¶ Set sail, all hands</i>
<i>where the rainbow lands ¶</i>

23:49.262 --> 23:52.096
<i>¶ Before the sun</i>
<i>sinks too low ¶</i>

23:52.098 --> 23:55.232
<i>¶ If the trade winds hide</i>
<i>we'll be there in time ¶</i>

23:55.234 --> 23:57.568
<i>¶ Before it fades away </i>

23:57.570 --> 23:59.503
<i>¶ There'll be</i>
<i>treasure at the end ¶</i>

23:59.505 --> 24:01.672
<i>¶ Treasure at the end</i>
<i>Treasure at the end ¶</i>

24:01.674 --> 24:03.574
<i>¶ Before it's gone again </i>

24:03.576 --> 24:07.111
<i>¶ Treasure at the end</i>
<i>of the rainbow ¶</i>
