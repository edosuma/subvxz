WEBVTT

00:02.877 --> 00:05.337
- Hmm. Oh, I don't know.
- What?

00:05.505 --> 00:07.923
Well, as old as he is in dog years...

00:08.090 --> 00:11.677
...do you think Snoopy
should still be allowed to fly this thing?

00:11.886 --> 00:14.013
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

00:14.180 --> 00:18.183
Remember when you came, you spent two
weeks getting trained by another waitress?

00:18.351 --> 00:21.103
Oh, sure.
Do you need me to train somebody new?

00:21.271 --> 00:23.564
Ha-ha-ha. Good one.

00:24.774 --> 00:28.694
Actually, uh,
Terry wants you to take the training again.

00:28.862 --> 00:29.903
Whenever.

00:33.658 --> 00:35.325
Do you believe that?

00:40.874 --> 00:41.915
Yeah.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.137
So that's two boxes
of the Holiday Macaroons.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.891
On behalf of the Brown Birds of America,
I salute you.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.438
Just admit it. You have no backhand.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.733
Excuse me, little one.
I have a very solid backhand.

01:49.901 --> 01:53.153
Shielding your face
and shrieking like a girl...

01:53.321 --> 01:55.364
...is not a backhand.

01:56.699 --> 01:58.367
I was shrieking...

01:58.535 --> 01:59.660
...like a Marine.

02:01.913 --> 02:06.333
All right, here, watch me execute
the three P's of championship play.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.252
Power, huah...

02:08.419 --> 02:09.836
...precision, shew...

02:10.003 --> 02:11.130
...and panache.

02:15.885 --> 02:17.719
You broke a little girl's leg?

02:18.388 --> 02:20.639
I know. I feel horrible, okay?

02:20.807 --> 02:24.977
It says here that a Muppet got whacked
on Sesame Street last night.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.730
Where exactly were you around 10-ish?

02:29.732 --> 02:33.443
Well, I'm gonna go see her.
I wanna bring her something.

02:33.611 --> 02:36.280
- What do you think she'd like?
- Maybe a Hello Kitty doll?

02:36.447 --> 02:38.574
The ability to walk?

02:42.370 --> 02:44.371
I'm gonna get back to retraining. Ahem.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.582
All right. See you guys.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.584
Look out, kids. He's coming.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.964
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.550
Have fun. Oh, wait. No, don't.

02:56.718 --> 03:00.012
I forgot. I am totally against that now.

03:00.972 --> 03:03.599
What? Me having a job?

03:03.975 --> 03:08.437
No, no. I am against innocent trees
being cut down in their prime...

03:08.605 --> 03:11.440
...and their corpses
grotesquely dressed...

03:11.608 --> 03:14.651
...in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.820
Hey, how do you sleep at night?

03:16.988 --> 03:20.574
Well, I'm pretty tired
from lugging the trees around.

03:21.826 --> 03:23.368
Hey, Phoebe, listen.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.370
You got this all wrong.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.581
Those trees were born
to be Christmas trees.

03:27.749 --> 03:31.960
They're fulfilling their life purpose
by making people happy.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.295
Really?

03:35.423 --> 03:37.216
Yes.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.927
Yes, and, uh, the trees are happy too...

03:40.094 --> 03:44.223
...because for most of them,
it's their only chance to see New York.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.646
After you've delivered the drinks,
you take the tray...

03:50.813 --> 03:54.316
Gunther, Gunther, please.
I have worked here for two and a half years.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.194
I know the empty trays go over there.

03:57.362 --> 04:00.280
What if you put them here?

04:00.448 --> 04:01.740
Huh.

04:02.367 --> 04:05.744
You know, that's actually a good idea.
They'll be closer to the mugs.

04:05.912 --> 04:09.623
You know what? You should have
the other waitresses do that too.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.292
- They already do.
- Huh?

04:12.460 --> 04:14.795
That's why they call it "the tray spot."

04:15.296 --> 04:18.966
I always heard them talk about that.
I just thought it was a club they went to.

04:19.132 --> 04:20.926
Oh, God.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.514
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.308
Sweetheart.

04:30.853 --> 04:34.648
So this must be kind of neat
for you, huh?

04:34.816 --> 04:37.401
Your dad tells me
you get a couple of days off school...

04:37.568 --> 04:40.737
...and you don't have to sell
those cookies anymore.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.533
Well, I kind of wanted to sell the cookies.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.452
The girl who sells the most
wins a trip to Space Camp...

04:47.620 --> 04:49.788
...and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.

04:49.956 --> 04:54.626
Wow, you really like
all this space stuff, huh?

04:54.794 --> 04:58.338
Yeah. My dad says if I'd spend as
much time helping him clean apartments...

04:58.506 --> 05:01.008
...as I do daydreaming
about outer space...

05:01.175 --> 05:03.927
...he'd be able to afford a trip
to the Taj Mahal.

05:04.095 --> 05:08.348
I think you'd have to clean a whole lot
of apartments to go all the way to India.

05:08.516 --> 05:11.685
No, the one in Atlantic City.
Dad loves the slots.

05:13.813 --> 05:17.232
He says he's gonna double
the college money my grandma left me.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.776
Huh.

05:19.944 --> 05:22.237
Well, good luck to Dad.

05:24.240 --> 05:28.910
Say, how many more boxes
would you have to sell in order to win?

05:29.120 --> 05:33.415
- The girl who won last year sold 475.
- Yeah?

05:33.583 --> 05:36.460
So far, I've sold 75.

05:39.213 --> 05:41.298
Four hundred, huh?

05:41.799 --> 05:45.177
Well, that sounds doable.
How much are the boxes?

05:45.345 --> 05:46.511
Five dollars a box.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.431
And what is second prize?

05:50.266 --> 05:51.558
A 10-speed bike.

05:51.726 --> 05:54.311
But I'd rather have something
my dad couldn't sell.

05:57.106 --> 05:58.523
Well, that makes sense.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.568
Could you do me one favor?
If it's not too much trouble.

06:01.736 --> 06:05.197
- Yeah, Sarah, anything.
- Could you pull the curtains open for me?

06:05.365 --> 06:08.283
The astronauts from the space shuttle
are gonna be on the news.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.952
Since we don't have a TV,
the lady across the alley...

06:11.120 --> 06:14.456
...said she'd push hers up to her window
so I can watch it.

06:26.969 --> 06:28.261
Yes?

06:28.429 --> 06:31.056
Yeah, hi. I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.

06:31.224 --> 06:36.228
You're no Brown Bird.
I can see you through my peephole.

06:37.063 --> 06:40.857
Um, no, hi. I'm an honorary Brown Bird.

06:44.487 --> 06:45.987
What does that mean?

06:46.155 --> 06:50.117
Uh, well, it means that I can sell cookies,
but I'm not invited to sleepovers.

06:55.039 --> 06:57.749
I can dial 911 at the press of a button,
you know.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.251
Now, go away.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.212
Please, please. It's for a poor little girl...

07:02.380 --> 07:05.966
...who wants to go to Space Camp
more than anything in the world.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.551
- I'm pressing.
- No...

07:07.718 --> 07:09.761
A policeman is on his way.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.973
Okay, okay. I'm going, I'm going.

07:17.895 --> 07:21.189
- I can still see you.
- All right.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.485
Hey.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.988
Hey. What are you doing here?

07:28.156 --> 07:30.198
Well, I thought a lot
about what you said...

07:30.366 --> 07:34.578
...and I realized, all right,
maybe I was a little judgmental.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.872
Yeah. Oh, but, oh. Ugh.

07:37.039 --> 07:39.499
Now, now, Phoebe, remember, hey...

07:39.667 --> 07:41.960
...they're just fulfilling their Christmas...

07:42.128 --> 07:43.587
- Destiny. Yes.
- Sure.

07:43.754 --> 07:46.465
- Right.
- Okay.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.968
Yikes. That one doesn't look
very fulfilled.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.388
Oh, that's one of the old ones.
He's just taking it to the back.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.932
You keep the old ones in the back?

07:56.100 --> 07:58.393
That is so ageist.

07:59.437 --> 08:03.815
- We have to make room for the fresh ones.
- So, what happens to the old guys?

08:04.358 --> 08:05.859
Well, they go into the chipper.

08:07.361 --> 08:10.322
Why do I have a feeling
that's not as happy as it sounds?

08:13.826 --> 08:14.868
No. No!

08:21.626 --> 08:23.418
Hey, hey, hey.

08:27.590 --> 08:30.133
And these come in the shapes
of Christmas characters.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.969
Santa, Rudolph and Baby Jesus.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.638
Oh.

08:34.804 --> 08:37.515
All right.
I'll take a box of the cream-filled Jesuses.

08:39.059 --> 08:42.562
Wait a minute, one box? I'm trying to send
a poor little girl to Space Camp.

08:42.730 --> 08:45.690
I'm putting you down for five boxes.
Chandler, what about you?

08:45.858 --> 08:50.195
All right, do you have any, uh,
coconut-flavored deities?

08:50.363 --> 08:54.533
No, but there's coconut
in the Hanukkah Menorah-eos.

08:55.451 --> 08:58.161
I'll put you down for eight boxes,
one for each night.

08:58.329 --> 08:59.371
Okay.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.499
- Mon?
- I'll take one box of the Mint Treasures.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.793
One, and that's it.

09:04.961 --> 09:07.546
I started gaining weight
after I joined the Brown Birds.

09:07.713 --> 09:11.591
Remember Dad bought every one
of my boxes and I ate them all?

09:12.593 --> 09:15.554
No, Mon, Dad had to buy every one
of your boxes...

09:15.721 --> 09:17.681
...because you ate them all.

09:20.059 --> 09:24.854
But, you know,
I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time.

09:25.022 --> 09:27.649
Why don't I just put you down
for three Mint Treasures...

09:27.817 --> 09:29.609
...and just a couple of the Rudolphs?

09:29.777 --> 09:31.278
No.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.449
Oh, come on, now.
You know you want them.

09:36.617 --> 09:39.035
Don't do this.

09:39.203 --> 09:43.707
I'll tell you what, Mon.
I'll give you the first box for free.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.668
Oh, God, I gotta go.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.963
Come on.
All the cool kids are eating them.

09:52.133 --> 09:55.343
And later I wanna show you
why we don't just trap spiders...

09:55.511 --> 09:58.305
...under coffee mugs
and leave them there.

10:01.559 --> 10:06.021
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate.
My life officially sucks.

10:06.188 --> 10:10.066
But wasn't this supposed to be temporary?
I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff.

10:10.234 --> 10:12.569
Well, yeah, I'm still pursuing that.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.739
How, exactly, are you pursuing that?

10:15.906 --> 10:19.826
You know, other than sending out résumés,
like, what, two years ago?

10:20.453 --> 10:23.705
Well, I'm also sending out...

10:23.873 --> 10:26.374
...good thoughts.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.919
If you ask me,
as long as you got this job...

10:30.087 --> 10:32.797
...you got nothing pushing you
to get another one.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.216
You need The Fear.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.052
- The Fear?
- He's right.

10:37.219 --> 10:39.471
If you quit this job,
you then have motivation...

10:39.639 --> 10:41.973
...to go after a job you really want.

10:42.141 --> 10:46.853
How come you're still at a job you hate?
Why don't you quit and get The Fear?

10:48.230 --> 10:50.398
Because I'm too afraid.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.901
God. I don't know.

10:53.069 --> 10:57.322
I mean, I would give anything to work
for a designer, you know, or a buyer.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.659
Ugh. I just don't wanna be 30
and still work here.

11:00.826 --> 11:05.705
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28
and still working here.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.791
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

11:07.958 --> 11:12.170
Remind me to review with you
which pot is decaf and which is regular.

11:13.547 --> 11:16.091
Can't I just look at the handles on them?

11:16.258 --> 11:18.009
You would think.

11:18.636 --> 11:22.806
Okay, fine. Gunther, you know what?
I am a terrible waitress.

11:22.973 --> 11:26.893
Do you know why I'm a terrible waitress?
Because I don't care.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.647
I don't care. I don't care which pot
is regular and which pot is decaf.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.649
I don't care where the tray spot is.

11:32.817 --> 11:36.069
I just don't care.
This is not what I wanna do.

11:37.279 --> 11:40.156
So I don't think I should do it anymore.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.952
- I'm gonna give you my week's notice.
- What?

11:44.120 --> 11:45.328
Gunther, I quit.

11:48.124 --> 11:51.042
Does this mean we're gonna have to start
paying for coffee?

11:55.840 --> 11:57.799
Okay, 12.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.843
Twenty-two.

12:00.010 --> 12:02.011
Eighteen.

12:06.267 --> 12:09.102
- What?
- I spelled out "boobies." Ha, ha.

12:13.649 --> 12:17.527
Ross, put me down for another box
of the Mint Treasures, okay?

12:17.695 --> 12:20.071
Where are the Mint Treasures?

12:20.948 --> 12:23.032
Uh, we're out. I sold them all.

12:23.534 --> 12:25.076
What?

12:25.244 --> 12:27.662
Monica, I'm cutting you off.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.959
No. No.

12:33.502 --> 12:35.211
Just a couple more boxes.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.591
It's no big deal, all right? I'm cool.

12:41.469 --> 12:44.137
You gotta help me out
with a couple more boxes.

12:45.222 --> 12:47.724
Mon, look at yourself.
You have cookie on your neck.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.225
Oh, God.

12:51.353 --> 12:55.398
- Whoa. So how many you sold so far?
- Ah? Check this out.

12:55.566 --> 12:59.819
- Five hundred and seventeen boxes.
- Oh, my God. How did you do that?

12:59.987 --> 13:02.280
Ahem. Okay, the other night,
I was leaving the museum...

13:02.448 --> 13:06.868
...just as Laser Floyd was letting out
of the planetarium.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.788
Without even trying, I sold 50 boxes.

13:09.955 --> 13:13.625
That's when it occurred to me.
The key to my success: The munchies.

13:15.336 --> 13:20.006
So I started hitting the NYU dorms
around midnight.

13:21.967 --> 13:25.136
I am selling cookies by the case.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.387
They call me...

13:26.555 --> 13:28.973
..."Cookie Dude."

13:30.434 --> 13:34.687
Okay, stop what you're doing.
I need envelope stuffers, stamp lickers...

13:34.855 --> 13:37.065
Oh, hey. Who did these résumés for you?

13:37.233 --> 13:38.650
Me, on my computer.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.777
Well, you sure used a large font.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.530
Uh, yeah.
Well, "Waitress at a Coffeehouse"...

13:43.697 --> 13:47.325
...and "Cheer Squad Co-captain"
only took up so much room.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.411
Heh, heh. Hey, that's funny.

13:50.579 --> 13:53.248
You're funny, Chandler.
You're a funny guy.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.291
You know what else is really funny?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.503
Something else I might have said?

13:59.296 --> 14:00.547
I don't know, I don't know.

14:00.714 --> 14:03.007
Weren't you the guy
that told me to quit my job...

14:03.175 --> 14:05.260
...when I had absolutely
nothing else to do?

14:05.427 --> 14:07.428
Ha-ha-ha. Huh? Huh?

14:09.557 --> 14:11.349
Sweetie, calm down. It's gonna be okay.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.101
No, it's not gonna be okay, Ross.

14:13.269 --> 14:17.188
Tomorrow is my last day,
and I don't have a lead.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.691
Okay, you know what?
I'm just gonna call Gunther...

14:19.859 --> 14:21.860
...and I'm gonna tell him I'm not quitting.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.445
You don't wanna give in to The Fear.

14:24.613 --> 14:28.032
You and your stupid Fear.
I hate your Fear.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.660
I would like to take you and your Fear...

14:30.828 --> 14:33.162
Hey. I got great news.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.915
Run, Joey. Run for your life.

14:37.835 --> 14:41.421
What? Rach, listen, have you ever heard
of Fortunata Fashions?

14:41.630 --> 14:44.215
- No.
- My old man's doing a plumbing job there...

14:44.383 --> 14:46.092
...and he heard they have an opening.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.386
Want me to see
if he can get you an interview?

14:48.554 --> 14:52.432
Oh, my God, yes. I would love that.
Oh, that's so sweet, Joey.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.436
Not a problem.
And now for the great news.

14:56.604 --> 15:00.356
- What, that wasn't the great news?
- Only if you think it's better than this.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.484
Snow-in-a-Can.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.654
I got it at work.
You want me to decorate the window?

15:06.822 --> 15:10.867
- Give it kind of a Christmas looky?
- Christmas cookie?

15:16.123 --> 15:18.499
Okay, and this one here's a Douglas fir.

15:18.751 --> 15:22.295
Now, it's a little more money,
but you get a nicer smell.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.964
Looks good. I'll take it.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.634
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.
You don't want that one. Uh-uh.

15:27.801 --> 15:32.221
No. You can have
this cool brown one. Ooh.

15:32.389 --> 15:34.724
It's almost dead.

15:34.892 --> 15:38.686
But that's why you have to buy it,
so that it can fulfill its Christmas destiny.

15:38.854 --> 15:41.606
Otherwise, they're gonna throw it
into the chipper. Tell him, Joey.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.107
Uh...

15:43.275 --> 15:47.028
Yeah, the trees that don't fulfill
their Christmas destiny, heh...

15:47.196 --> 15:49.489
...are thrown in the chipper.

15:50.407 --> 15:53.618
I think I'm gonna look around
a little bit more.

15:54.370 --> 15:58.414
Pheebs. Heh. You gotta stop doing this.
I'm working on commission here.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.335
Hey, guys.
I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.

16:02.503 --> 16:05.964
Well, look no further. This one's yours.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.007
Ah.

16:08.467 --> 16:11.469
Is this the one that I threw out last year?

16:12.638 --> 16:15.640
All right, you know what? Never mind.
Everybody wants to have a green one.

16:17.017 --> 16:19.602
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to get so emotional.

16:19.770 --> 16:23.106
I guess it's just...
The holidays are just hard.

16:23.273 --> 16:27.026
Oh, honey, is that because
your mom died around Christmas?

16:27.194 --> 16:29.529
Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that.

16:30.739 --> 16:31.864
Oh.

16:39.039 --> 16:42.083
Hi there. How many did you sell?

16:42.251 --> 16:46.838
I'm not gonna tell you.
You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.800
Hey, now. That was an accident, okay?

16:50.968 --> 16:52.176
You're a big scrud.

16:54.388 --> 16:55.888
What's a scrud?

16:56.056 --> 16:58.141
Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud?

17:00.269 --> 17:03.438
I don't have to. I can just look at you.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.273
All right, girls...

17:07.526 --> 17:09.609
...and man.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.155
Let's see your final tallies.

17:12.321 --> 17:15.116
Oh... Debbie.

17:15.992 --> 17:19.328
Three hundred and twenty-one boxes
of cookies. Very nice.

17:19.788 --> 17:22.123
Not nice enough.

17:22.708 --> 17:23.915
Charla.

17:24.084 --> 17:26.127
Two hundred and seventy-eight.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.212
Sorry, dear, but still good.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.965
Good for a scrud.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.384
Let's see.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.261
Ooh. Yes, Elizabeth.

17:36.638 --> 17:38.806
Eight hundred and seventy-one.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.933
That's crap.

17:44.188 --> 17:46.397
Sister Brown Bird.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.733
Good going.

17:50.986 --> 17:53.196
Who's next?

17:57.451 --> 17:59.786
- Hi there.
- Hi.

18:00.662 --> 18:03.372
And batting for Sarah...

18:03.540 --> 18:05.875
...Ross Geller.

18:06.043 --> 18:09.128
Eight hundred and seventy-two.

18:10.380 --> 18:14.759
Although it looks like you bought
an awful lot of cookies yourself.

18:14.927 --> 18:21.182
Ahem. That is because my doctor
says that I have a very serious...

18:21.642 --> 18:23.684
...nougat...

18:25.270 --> 18:27.396
...deficiency.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.567
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.070
Well, I lost.

18:34.238 --> 18:37.198
Some little girl loaned her uniform
to her 19-year-old sister...

18:37.366 --> 18:42.245
...who went down to the USS Nimitz
and sold over 2000 boxes.

18:44.248 --> 18:47.416
- Hey. How'd the interview go?
- Oh, I blew it.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.710
- I wouldn't have even hired me.
- Oh.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.754
- Ugh.
- Come here, sweetie.

18:51.922 --> 18:58.511
Listen, you're gonna go on like
a thousand interviews before you get a job.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.434
That's not how that was supposed
to come out.

19:05.602 --> 19:08.062
This is just the worst Christmas ever.

19:08.230 --> 19:11.399
Rach, maybe you should just, you know,
stay here at the coffeehouse.

19:11.567 --> 19:15.653
I can't. It's too late.
Terry already hired that girl over there.

19:15.821 --> 19:20.366
Look at her.
She's even got waitress experience. Ugh.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.493
Last night she was...

19:22.661 --> 19:27.790
...teaching everybody
how to make napkins into...

19:27.958 --> 19:29.333
...swans.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.753
That word was "swans."

19:32.921 --> 19:34.714
"Swans."

19:37.843 --> 19:42.471
Well, seeing that drunk Santa wet himself
really perked up my Christmas.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.231
Ah! Oh, my God.

19:52.774 --> 19:54.358
Merry Christmas!

19:55.903 --> 19:58.196
You saved them. You guys.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.364
Oh, God, you're the best.

20:00.532 --> 20:03.117
Looks like Night of the Living Dead
Christmas Trees.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.372
Hello?

20:08.540 --> 20:10.374
Yeah, this is she.

20:11.293 --> 20:14.587
Oh! You're kidding. You're kidding.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.215
Oh, thank you. I love you.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.675
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.510
I got the job.

20:21.678 --> 20:23.846
- Oh, hey. All right!
- That's great.

20:24.014 --> 20:27.433
Oh! God bless us, every one.

20:29.853 --> 20:33.147
Here we go.
I'm serving my last cup of coffee.

20:41.031 --> 20:44.283
There you go. Enjoy.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.035
Yay!

20:47.204 --> 20:48.913
- Should I tell her I ordered tea?
- No.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.082
- No.
- No.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.458
Um, excuse me, everyone?

20:52.668 --> 20:56.045
Uh, this is my last night working here...

20:56.213 --> 21:01.634
...and I just wanted to say
that I made some really good friends here.

21:01.802 --> 21:04.470
And it's just time to move on.

21:08.642 --> 21:11.435
And no offense to everybody
who still works here...

21:11.603 --> 21:15.064
...but you have no idea
how good it feels to say...

21:15.232 --> 21:17.775
...that as of this moment...

21:17.943 --> 21:22.822
...I will never have to make coffee again.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.825
Now, Mr. Kaplan Sr.
Likes his coffee strong.

21:25.993 --> 21:29.412
So you're gonna use two bags
instead of one, see?

21:29.579 --> 21:32.373
Now, pay attention
because this part's tricky.

21:32.541 --> 21:35.960
See, some people use filters just once.

21:44.678 --> 21:47.346
I'm sorry you didn't get to go
to Space Camp...

21:47.514 --> 21:53.102
...and I'm hoping that maybe somehow,
this may help make up for it. Okay?

21:53.270 --> 21:54.729
Presenting...

21:54.896 --> 21:58.983
...Sarah Tuddle's Private,
Very Special Space Camp!

22:03.196 --> 22:05.323
Really, Mr. Geller,
you don't have to do this.

22:05.490 --> 22:06.615
Oh, come on. Here we go.

22:08.160 --> 22:12.121
Stand by for mission countdown.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.706
Ten, ten, ten.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.124
Nine, nine, nine.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.460
Eight, eight, eight. Ow.

22:18.253 --> 22:19.545
Okay, blast off.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.766
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.

22:31.933 --> 22:34.935
Oh, no, an asteroid!
