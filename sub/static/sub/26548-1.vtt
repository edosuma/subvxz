02:02.881 --> 02:04.543
We weren't
expecting you till tomorrow.

02:04.545 --> 02:05.759
Well, the
timeline's moved up.

02:05.761 --> 02:07.711
That's why the
doc was stressed out.

02:07.713 --> 02:08.704
Palmer?

02:08.705 --> 02:10.592
Yeah, she arrived
just before you did.

02:19.233 --> 02:20.383
Hey, Palmer?

02:20.385 --> 02:22.143
Get out here, where are you?

02:22.145 --> 02:23.264
No, no.

02:23.266 --> 02:25.246
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Palmer!

02:39.297 --> 02:41.539
Sir, we got a problem.

02:50.881 --> 02:52.066
- Yes!
- Home run!

02:53.857 --> 02:55.298
We gotta go now.

03:22.338 --> 03:24.575
So, you
decided what you're doing

03:24.577 --> 03:26.271
for your science project?

03:26.273 --> 03:29.119
You mean what you're
doing for my science project?

03:29.121 --> 03:31.104
Uh, nope.

03:31.106 --> 03:33.823
Sorry, bro, you are on your own.

03:33.825 --> 03:35.423
And I mean, it better be good,

03:35.425 --> 03:37.663
because my regression
cell synosteosis

03:37.665 --> 03:39.263
is gonna blow Dunkle's mind.

03:39.265 --> 03:40.545
A-ba-boom.

03:41.153 --> 03:42.654
Yeah.

03:42.656 --> 03:43.807
Good.

03:43.809 --> 03:45.889
Look, James, are
you even listening?

03:46.881 --> 03:47.682
Totally.

03:48.897 --> 03:51.199
Let me guess,
calculating the probability

03:51.201 --> 03:52.415
that Natalie will
go out with you

03:52.417 --> 03:54.238
in a predetermined
set of scenarios?

03:54.240 --> 03:55.903
Fat chance.

03:55.905 --> 03:58.399
Might wanna start running the
numbers on last man on Earth.

03:58.401 --> 03:59.745
Wait, you can do that?

04:00.896 --> 04:02.560
Dude, you're so
gonna get Dunkled.

04:02.562 --> 04:04.256
She's not gonna flunk me.

04:04.258 --> 04:05.791
Last thing that lady
wants to see is me

04:05.793 --> 04:07.679
falling asleep in
her class next year.

04:07.681 --> 04:08.481
Dude.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.647
You gotta start trying, man.

04:11.649 --> 04:13.279
You know, you gotta try harder.

04:13.281 --> 04:14.432
You gotta work for
it, it's not just

04:14.434 --> 04:15.552
gonna come to you, you know?

04:15.554 --> 04:17.278
And I'm only saying this
because I'm your friend, but...

04:18.945 --> 04:19.966
I mean, come on dude, I can't
keep doing everything for you.

04:19.969 --> 04:21.120
Did you see that?

04:51.585 --> 04:52.193
What?

05:15.584 --> 05:17.122
What do you think
they're looking for?

05:18.721 --> 05:19.521
A dead body?

05:20.641 --> 05:22.402
Looking for Kim K.'s
talent, I don't know.

05:36.865 --> 05:38.017
Let's find out.

06:01.954 --> 06:03.838
Come on, come on.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.758
We lost her.

06:05.760 --> 06:09.438
We can't let her
get away with this technology.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.614
Grant's gonna kill us.

06:11.616 --> 06:12.417
Really?

06:16.354 --> 06:18.238
Who do you think they are, dude?

06:18.240 --> 06:19.294
I don't know.

06:19.296 --> 06:20.799
DEA?

06:20.801 --> 06:22.175
FBI, MIB?

06:22.177 --> 06:23.775
MIB?

06:23.777 --> 06:24.992
Dude, seriously?

06:24.994 --> 06:25.762
What?

06:33.697 --> 06:36.287
Palmer, we
just want the device!

06:36.289 --> 06:39.106
It's Arachnacorp
property, come on!

06:51.009 --> 06:52.832
Execute Motocom Protocol.

06:52.834 --> 06:54.818
Certainly, Dr. Palmer.

07:06.305 --> 07:08.993
You'll be safe here.

07:12.322 --> 07:13.983
Whoever they are,

07:13.985 --> 07:15.934
they're obviously freaking
out over something major.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.151
Something valuable.

07:17.153 --> 07:18.814
At night?

07:18.816 --> 07:20.672
Come on, maybe it's hunters.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.655
Maybe it's serial killers.

07:22.657 --> 07:24.734
Maybe we should go check
it out in the morning.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.337
Wow, that's a great idea.

07:27.648 --> 07:31.231
Besides, I'm not
skipping school tomorrow.

07:31.233 --> 07:32.418
Come on, this is crazy.

07:37.729 --> 07:39.104
Fine.

07:39.106 --> 07:41.379
After, we'll go after.

07:46.689 --> 07:47.839
- It's my dad.
- Oh.

07:47.841 --> 07:48.766
I gotta go.

07:48.768 --> 07:51.553
Yeah, dude.

08:32.991 --> 08:34.753
Ha, Buster, come on.

08:36.481 --> 08:37.282
Buster.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.477
Oof, you stink.

08:40.480 --> 08:42.623
9:45 on a school night, man.

08:42.625 --> 08:44.158
You gotta hear this.

08:44.159 --> 08:46.143
Danny and I saw these people.

08:46.145 --> 08:47.778
They had flashlights
in the woods.

08:48.738 --> 08:49.727
Okay?

08:49.729 --> 08:51.646
It's probably just someone
out for a night run.

08:51.648 --> 08:52.831
- But...
- I'm sure it's nothing.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.615
Listen, I have a early meeting
with the bank about the shop,

08:55.617 --> 08:56.959
can you get yourself
up in the morning?

08:56.961 --> 08:58.558
I think I can manage.

08:58.560 --> 09:00.639
Or, you know, I can wake
you up before I leave.

09:00.641 --> 09:01.442
No, thanks.

09:02.369 --> 09:03.518
Okay.

09:03.520 --> 09:04.319
I'll leave some cash
on the kitchen counter,

09:04.321 --> 09:05.534
just get yourself
a pizza in case

09:05.536 --> 09:07.327
I'm running late, all right?

09:07.329 --> 09:08.926
Half pepperoni for me, please.

09:08.928 --> 09:10.111
You know processed meats

09:10.113 --> 09:12.127
have been linked
to cancer, right?

09:12.129 --> 09:14.113
Right, better make it
meat lover's instead.

09:16.097 --> 09:16.898
Come on, boy.

09:18.464 --> 09:19.394
Lights out by 10.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.169
Come on.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.279
What's up, playa playa?

09:33.281 --> 09:34.078
Let's ride.

09:34.080 --> 09:34.977
Holla, home skillet.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.023
How weird was last night?

09:37.025 --> 09:37.919
Insane.

09:37.921 --> 09:39.583
I had crazy dreams about it.

09:39.585 --> 09:41.823
Was that after or before
your dream about Natalie?

10:29.889 --> 10:30.752
Morning, boys.

10:30.754 --> 10:32.350
Hi, Mr. Miller.

10:32.352 --> 10:34.431
Tell your father I got
those moving boxes ordered.

10:34.433 --> 10:35.807
Will do, thanks.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.122
Bye.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.737
Think fast.

10:46.177 --> 10:47.298
Later, losers.

10:49.921 --> 10:51.522
- Jerks!
- Jockholds.

10:57.696 --> 11:00.479
So, I'll expect a
detailed proposal from each

11:00.481 --> 11:02.402
of you by Monday.

11:03.489 --> 11:05.439
Don't forget your
proposal should include

11:05.441 --> 11:08.447
a detailed hypothesis,
including an outline

11:08.449 --> 11:10.335
of your methods and materials.

11:14.624 --> 11:15.616
Any questions?

11:19.552 --> 11:21.665
I'll be in the chem
lab until 3:15.

11:26.337 --> 11:27.710
Here you go.

11:27.712 --> 11:30.174
- Um...
- You dropped your pencil.

11:30.176 --> 11:31.230
Oh, yeah.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.887
I didn't steal it or
anything, it just came to me.

11:33.889 --> 11:34.690
It rolled to me.

11:35.873 --> 11:36.895
Right.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.687
Okay, well, thanks?

11:38.689 --> 11:40.002
Nash, James Nash.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.463
Thank you, James.

11:42.465 --> 11:43.586
You're welcome, Natalie.

11:45.377 --> 11:47.391
Okay, bye.

11:48.193 --> 11:49.375
It rolled to me?

11:49.377 --> 11:50.210
That was weird.

12:24.065 --> 12:25.119
Did you find her?

12:25.121 --> 12:26.559
We located her car, Sir.

12:26.561 --> 12:28.033
Actually that
was my idea, Sir.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.679
Now why would I
care about her car

12:31.681 --> 12:35.295
if Ms. Palmer and the
device aren't in it?

12:35.297 --> 12:36.543
Actually, that was her idea.

12:36.545 --> 12:37.663
Oh, no no, do
not put this on me.

12:37.665 --> 12:39.199
Oh no no no,

12:39.201 --> 12:40.223
- don't put that on me
- You're the one who said...

12:40.225 --> 12:42.078
- I did not say that!
- Enough!

12:42.080 --> 12:44.351
I want you to go back
out and find her.

12:44.353 --> 12:46.143
She's not just gonna
come strolling...

12:48.673 --> 12:51.070
Well, well, well, you've
got some nerve, haven't you?

12:51.072 --> 12:53.087
Strolling back in here.

12:53.089 --> 12:55.582
What is she doing here, sir?

12:55.584 --> 12:56.735
Well, for starters
I'd like my car back.

12:56.737 --> 12:58.558
That's not happening.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.873
We got
one more lap, come on!

13:06.401 --> 13:07.262
Danny, hold up.

13:07.264 --> 13:08.894
Where you going?

13:08.896 --> 13:10.911
Um, home?

13:10.913 --> 13:11.873
What'd you forget?

13:12.961 --> 13:14.911
Wait, you were
serious about that?

13:14.913 --> 13:16.127
We gotta know
what's out there.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.655
Of course you were
serious about that.

13:18.657 --> 13:20.766
Come on, daylight's burning.

13:20.768 --> 13:23.358
I thought we
had an understanding.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.766
If I'm being charged
with something,

13:24.768 --> 13:25.759
I'd like to know what it is.

13:25.761 --> 13:27.359
If not, I'd like to go.

13:27.361 --> 13:28.670
You're not
going anywhere until you

13:28.672 --> 13:30.334
tell me where the device is.

13:30.336 --> 13:31.199
And why would I do that?

13:31.201 --> 13:32.894
Because it's mine.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.239
That's debatable.

13:34.241 --> 13:36.415
Your father commissioned
F.R.E.D.I. to save lives,

13:36.417 --> 13:38.015
not destroy them.

13:38.017 --> 13:39.615
It will save lives, American
lives, on the battlefield.

13:39.617 --> 13:42.110
You voided your contract
and all your rights

13:42.112 --> 13:43.839
- to the tech when you decided...
- My lawyers don't seem

13:43.841 --> 13:45.023
- to think so.
- With all the changes that

13:45.025 --> 13:46.366
- you've mandated.
- What concern is

13:46.368 --> 13:46.814
- that of yours?
- If it falls into

13:46.816 --> 13:47.582
the wrong hands.

13:47.584 --> 13:48.799
Tell me where it is!

13:50.465 --> 13:51.359
What?

13:51.361 --> 13:53.183
Lopez managed to restore 78%

13:53.185 --> 13:54.530
of the data from the purge, sir.

13:56.032 --> 13:56.961
And the device?

13:58.112 --> 13:59.745
We're locked in on
its tracking beacon.

14:02.177 --> 14:02.978
Excellent.

14:07.969 --> 14:10.818
So, what exactly
are we looking for?

14:11.873 --> 14:13.439
Anything.

14:13.441 --> 14:16.674
Everything, clues, signs,
evidence, whatever.

14:36.672 --> 14:38.495
Uh, I'm hungry.

14:38.497 --> 14:39.488
No problemo.

14:45.409 --> 14:46.945
What do you have in there?

14:50.561 --> 14:51.873
Beans, really?

14:53.121 --> 14:54.401
A flashlight?

14:57.536 --> 14:59.583
Candy.

14:59.585 --> 15:00.481
More candy.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.447
Rope?

15:04.449 --> 15:05.983
I don't even think I wanna
know what this is for.

15:05.985 --> 15:07.042
Just being prepared.

15:08.161 --> 15:10.751
For what, the
zombie apocalypse?

15:10.753 --> 15:11.934
May I remind you that your house

15:11.936 --> 15:14.334
is two football fields that way?

15:14.336 --> 15:15.872
Yeah, but not for much longer.

15:20.353 --> 15:20.962
Yeah.

15:21.792 --> 15:23.553
I, uh, saw the sign.

15:25.600 --> 15:28.415
So your dad's really
doing it, huh?

15:28.417 --> 15:32.094
Put it on
the market yesterday.

15:32.096 --> 15:33.279
So now what?

15:33.281 --> 15:34.274
You're looking for
buried treasure?

15:39.296 --> 15:41.569
Well, uh, let's get to it.

15:48.833 --> 15:51.102
Well, where's the signal?

15:51.104 --> 15:53.026
It's going northeast
across state line.

15:54.241 --> 15:56.094
Huh, that's weird,
there's nothing out

15:56.096 --> 15:58.174
that way, but, oh no.

15:58.176 --> 15:59.423
What do you mean oh no?

15:59.425 --> 16:01.055
It just stopped.

16:01.057 --> 16:02.814
What do you mean
it just stopped?

16:02.816 --> 16:04.001
I mean it just stopped.

16:06.144 --> 16:08.034
I hope you brought
a change of clothes.

16:09.856 --> 16:10.913
Listen, man.

16:12.256 --> 16:14.142
We've been searching
for nearly two hours

16:14.144 --> 16:15.615
and we haven't found a thing.

16:15.617 --> 16:18.335
We haven't
found a thing yet.

16:18.337 --> 16:21.150
Look, maybe it's
just time we call it a day.

16:21.152 --> 16:22.816
Maybe it's time
you sucked it up.

16:24.640 --> 16:25.982
My mom's expecting
me home before dinner,

16:25.984 --> 16:27.935
you know how she is.

16:27.937 --> 16:29.889
Well, we wouldn't wanna
keep your mother waiting.

16:30.721 --> 16:32.959
Yeah, like you'd know.

16:32.961 --> 16:34.658
What's that supposed to mean?

16:37.216 --> 16:38.241
Nothing, dude.

16:40.385 --> 16:41.407
You know what?

16:41.409 --> 16:43.262
How about you come have
dinner at my house tonight.

16:43.264 --> 16:44.992
I can have dinner
at my own house.

16:46.113 --> 16:46.913
Dude, I.

16:47.968 --> 16:49.342
I really gotta go.

16:49.344 --> 16:50.560
Fine, then go.

16:51.712 --> 16:52.831
I can't just leave
you out here alone,

16:52.833 --> 16:53.950
it's gonna get dark soon.

16:53.952 --> 16:56.513
I'll head back when I finish
this stretch of the road.

16:59.585 --> 17:00.545
All right.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.224
Call me if you need me.

17:25.185 --> 17:27.198
I think I got something.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.185
Where's the rest of it?

18:15.584 --> 18:16.642
This is it.

18:55.744 --> 18:56.736
I knew it!

19:02.369 --> 19:03.170
Whoa.

19:41.536 --> 19:42.113
F.R.E.D.I.

19:45.504 --> 19:46.273
Buster!

19:47.936 --> 19:49.181
Buster, no!

19:49.183 --> 19:49.728
Buster.

19:51.104 --> 19:51.649
Go, go.

19:57.505 --> 19:58.913
What do you do?

20:07.585 --> 20:08.480
I found something.

20:10.944 --> 20:12.608
You're never going
to believe this.

20:18.657 --> 20:19.457
I don't know.

20:28.832 --> 20:33.633
That's weird.

20:34.752 --> 20:37.471
You must have a power button.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.350
James, I'm home.

20:40.352 --> 20:41.343
Great.

20:41.345 --> 20:43.262
Let's go, I'm starving.

20:43.264 --> 20:44.225
Coming!

20:56.768 --> 20:57.823
Did you find it?

20:57.825 --> 21:01.823
Uh, well, actually sir,
we found the homing beacon.

21:01.825 --> 21:04.382
Bring the device
back to the lab, stat.

21:04.384 --> 21:05.919
Well, actually, sir, you see,

21:05.921 --> 21:09.183
the beacon was disconnected
from the device.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.294
Well, why would you do that?

21:11.296 --> 21:14.270
Uh, no, sir, you see,
the beacon was separated

21:14.272 --> 21:16.734
prior to us finding the device.

21:16.736 --> 21:18.813
We suspect that it may
have been compromised.

21:18.815 --> 21:19.809
All right.

21:20.736 --> 21:23.391
Look, I'll have a
chat with Ms. Palmer

21:23.393 --> 21:26.430
and you two clowns stop messing
around and get back here.

21:26.432 --> 21:27.426
Show me.

21:41.824 --> 21:42.785
Oh my god.

21:43.905 --> 21:45.888
Thank god your mother isn't
here to see me eat like this.

21:48.257 --> 21:50.018
Who's ready for a refill?

21:50.720 --> 21:51.519
Sure.

21:51.521 --> 21:52.702
Nah, I'm good.

21:52.704 --> 21:53.469
Can I get
this outta your way?

21:53.471 --> 21:55.230
Oh, no, no, no, not.

21:55.232 --> 21:57.469
Make a move for his fries
you might lose a finger.

21:57.471 --> 21:58.688
Thanks for the tip.

22:01.024 --> 22:04.480
Listen, um, your mother
sent me an email this morning

22:05.664 --> 22:07.550
and she and your
sister were hoping

22:07.552 --> 22:10.529
for a visit from you
over the long weekend.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.217
I know, she called yesterday.

22:14.143 --> 22:16.129
Oh, you spoke to her.

22:17.535 --> 22:20.064
Great, great, so you want
me to book you a ticket?

22:21.249 --> 22:22.945
Can we afford that?

22:24.673 --> 22:26.877
Don't worry about that, okay?

22:26.879 --> 22:30.431
Meeting with the bank,
pretty good I think.

22:30.433 --> 22:31.521
- Did you get the money?
- No.

22:33.056 --> 22:35.903
But they said they would get
back to me a loan for the shop.

22:35.905 --> 22:39.261
Does that mean we don't
have to sell the house?

22:39.263 --> 22:41.310
Do we really need
that big of a house?

22:41.312 --> 22:42.400
Just the two of us?

22:43.456 --> 22:45.278
I was thinking
maybe an apartment.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.871
You know, with a pool,
something like that.

22:47.873 --> 22:48.833
What about Buster?

22:49.888 --> 22:50.910
He's our family.

22:50.912 --> 22:52.189
Also a dog.

22:52.191 --> 22:54.462
He's my dog, he's my friend.

22:54.464 --> 22:56.673
Why can't you figure this out?

23:00.609 --> 23:03.393
You know the rules,
man, no gadgets at dinner.

23:06.431 --> 23:09.439
Have we put any more thought
into your science project?

23:09.441 --> 23:11.389
I was thinking maybe
one of those, you know,

23:11.391 --> 23:13.086
volcanoes where you
pour the stuff in

23:13.088 --> 23:14.974
and then it blows up
and then most likely

23:14.976 --> 23:16.063
I clean it all up.

23:16.065 --> 23:18.048
That's kid stuff, I'm in
high school now, remember?

23:21.535 --> 23:22.974
All right, what's going on?

23:22.976 --> 23:23.935
Are you sure there's not something
you wanna tell me here?

23:23.937 --> 23:25.533
No, it's fine,
it's just Danny.

23:25.535 --> 23:28.287
He's anxious to get a
head start on the weekend.

23:28.289 --> 23:29.919
Oh, big plans?

23:29.921 --> 23:31.358
Oh yeah, you know us.

23:31.360 --> 23:32.799
We're planning to knock over
a couple convenient stores

23:32.801 --> 23:34.941
in a tri-county crime
spree overnight.

23:34.943 --> 23:36.063
Maybe boost a Ferrari.

23:36.065 --> 23:37.790
Cops should have
me home by dawn.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.008
I look forward to that.

23:41.695 --> 23:42.750
All done here?

23:42.752 --> 23:43.646
Yeah.

23:43.648 --> 23:44.414
Anyone like a piece of pie?

23:44.416 --> 23:45.022
Apple or peach?

23:45.024 --> 23:46.014
Fresh baked today.

23:46.016 --> 23:48.542
Oh, you know what?

23:48.544 --> 23:50.750
Pack one up to go for me,
breakfast of champions.

23:50.752 --> 23:51.549
You want one?

23:51.551 --> 23:52.352
No, thanks.

23:53.375 --> 23:55.169
Thank you.

23:56.576 --> 23:58.047
I can assure you
we're going to have

23:58.049 --> 24:00.033
an unmitigated
success with this.

24:01.728 --> 24:02.529
Yes.

24:03.969 --> 24:05.088
Yes, sir.

24:06.816 --> 24:07.999
I understand that, dad.

24:08.001 --> 24:10.749
So what, oh, yeah,
okay, okay, dad.

24:10.751 --> 24:12.481
Am I in charge here or am I not?

24:13.376 --> 24:14.493
Thank you.

24:14.495 --> 24:16.225
So, just go on an
enjoy your cup of cocoa

24:17.120 --> 24:18.463
and say hi to mom for me, okay?

24:18.465 --> 24:19.393
Thanks, bye.

24:32.032 --> 24:33.438
Hmm.

24:33.440 --> 24:34.241
Coulda sworn.

24:45.216 --> 24:46.494
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

24:46.496 --> 24:49.087
Uh, what do you think?

24:49.089 --> 24:50.878
The guys at Harvest
suggested I get

24:50.880 --> 24:52.861
some sort of a business
plan, you know, diversify,

24:52.863 --> 24:54.909
and thought maybe
selling these skateboards

24:54.911 --> 24:57.727
in the shop would bring
in some new customers.

24:57.729 --> 24:58.717
I dunno though.

24:58.719 --> 25:00.257
It's minimalist.

25:01.503 --> 25:03.357
Yeah, simple.

25:03.359 --> 25:05.151
Yeah, that's what
I thought so, too.

25:05.153 --> 25:06.910
I kinda like it, I think.

25:06.912 --> 25:09.247
Anyway, you mind
giving it a test ride?

25:09.249 --> 25:10.047
- Sure thing, thanks.
- Thanks.

25:10.049 --> 25:11.902
Yeah, let me know
what you think.

25:11.904 --> 25:14.751
All right, so listen, I'm
gonna search some flights

25:14.753 --> 25:15.933
for your trip to
Tucson and probably

25:15.935 --> 25:17.150
just turning in early.

25:17.152 --> 25:18.622
Sounds good.

25:18.624 --> 25:20.737
Watch some Netflix
and chill if you wanna.

25:21.696 --> 25:24.446
That doesn't mean what
you think it means, dad.

25:24.448 --> 25:25.758
Yeah, that was weird.

25:25.760 --> 25:26.560
Goodnight.

26:01.793 --> 26:04.223
Dude, seriously, a toy?

26:04.225 --> 26:05.757
You're tripping out over a toy?

26:05.759 --> 26:07.677
I don't think it's a toy.

26:07.679 --> 26:09.664
Okay, did you
try to turn it on?

26:10.624 --> 26:12.381
There's no switch.

26:12.383 --> 26:14.590
Great, a
toy that doesn't work.

26:14.592 --> 26:16.190
I mean, where did
you even find it?

26:16.192 --> 26:19.165
Okay, after you left I
found this old hunting blind

26:19.167 --> 26:20.222
and I don't know,
but it looked like

26:20.224 --> 26:21.406
someone was living in it.

26:21.408 --> 26:23.102
There wasn't anyone
in there but...

26:29.152 --> 26:31.390
There was this
sleeping bag and there

26:31.392 --> 26:34.462
was this tactical
bag and it was in it.

26:34.464 --> 26:37.214
That's pretty dope.

26:37.216 --> 26:38.526
Yeah, you gotta get over here.

26:38.528 --> 26:41.310
Mom, Luke
put paint in my hair!

26:41.312 --> 26:44.990
Luke, do not
paint your brother!

26:44.992 --> 26:47.070
I'll be right over.

26:47.072 --> 26:49.056
Okay, see ya in a bit.

27:20.703 --> 27:22.557
Caution,
you are at risk for a fall,

27:22.559 --> 27:24.352
allow me to assist you.

27:36.960 --> 27:37.951
What?

27:37.953 --> 27:38.977
You can talk?

27:40.960 --> 27:42.590
A warning?

27:42.592 --> 27:43.807
About what?

27:43.809 --> 27:45.441
It thought I was gonna fall.

27:46.655 --> 27:49.471
So it's got AI?

27:49.473 --> 27:50.433
I guess so.

27:51.359 --> 27:53.856
This thing has to be
following Asimov's laws.

27:55.232 --> 27:56.543
English, professor?

27:56.545 --> 27:58.077
Robotics 101, dude.

27:58.079 --> 27:59.966
It can't allow
anyone to get hurt,

27:59.968 --> 28:01.086
it has to obey human command

28:01.088 --> 28:03.168
and it has to protect
its own existence.

28:05.793 --> 28:07.041
Let's see if it's serious.

28:09.055 --> 28:09.856
Wait, what?

28:12.288 --> 28:13.470
Hmm.

28:13.472 --> 28:16.189
Well, okay, we need to
put you in danger again.

28:16.191 --> 28:19.422
Maybe we can illicit another
warning, wake him up, I don't...

28:19.424 --> 28:20.413
Oh, okay.

28:20.415 --> 28:21.213
Stand up, stand up.

28:21.215 --> 28:22.208
Follow my lead.

28:28.159 --> 28:30.174
Okay.

28:30.176 --> 28:31.742
You're gonna die!

28:31.744 --> 28:33.469
Oh, I'm gonna die!

28:33.471 --> 28:34.494
He's gonna die!

28:34.496 --> 28:36.413
- Unless I get saved by...
- Unless someone saves

28:36.415 --> 28:37.568
him for some reason.

28:43.007 --> 28:45.278
This sucks, it
knows we're faking.

28:46.079 --> 28:47.072
What now?

28:49.920 --> 28:50.913
Well.

28:53.185 --> 28:55.677
How confident are
you that this thing

28:55.679 --> 28:58.238
is actually trying
to protect you?

28:58.240 --> 28:59.585
I know what I saw.

29:28.191 --> 29:30.173
What the heck?

29:37.600 --> 29:38.877
How much longer
are we gonna do this?

29:38.879 --> 29:40.609
Until you decide to cooperate.

29:43.647 --> 29:46.973
Sir, we recovered
91.1% of the data.

29:46.975 --> 29:49.309
What about the other 9.9%?

29:49.311 --> 29:50.430
8.9.

29:50.432 --> 29:51.454
What?

29:51.456 --> 29:53.025
8.9%.

29:54.240 --> 29:57.533
91.1% would leave you 8.9%
shy of full data recovery.

29:57.535 --> 29:59.966
Uh, so now you
wanna be helpful?

29:59.968 --> 30:00.766
Butt out, Lopez.

30:00.768 --> 30:01.569
Yes, sir.

30:03.232 --> 30:05.438
So now you're
being helpful, hm?

30:05.440 --> 30:06.750
It's simple math.

30:06.752 --> 30:09.501
There's been some
slight data corruption.

30:09.503 --> 30:10.590
What do you mean?

30:10.592 --> 30:11.646
I'm not sure yet.

30:11.648 --> 30:14.078
We won't know until we
attempt to execute a protocol

30:14.080 --> 30:15.614
or a series of
protocols to show how

30:15.616 --> 30:17.405
the prototype's capabilities
have been affected.

30:17.407 --> 30:20.352
So why don't we just
let it do something.

30:21.439 --> 30:24.093
Hey, fly it back here.

30:24.095 --> 30:25.917
Ah, yes, the raven protocol.

30:25.919 --> 30:26.910
Great job, sir.

30:26.912 --> 30:27.710
Do it.

30:27.712 --> 30:28.606
Right away.

30:37.343 --> 30:38.622
All right.

30:38.624 --> 30:41.088
Three, two, one.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.241
What the?

30:49.759 --> 30:52.189
Activating
Raven Protocol.

30:52.191 --> 30:52.992
Whoa.

30:55.455 --> 30:56.638
Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

30:56.640 --> 30:57.632
It's flying.

30:59.551 --> 31:01.470
Unable to
activate Raven Protocol.

31:01.472 --> 31:04.414
I will run a self-diagnostic
to assess the problem.

31:04.416 --> 31:05.341
One moment, please.

31:20.031 --> 31:21.376
What is that?

31:23.551 --> 31:26.429
I can't tell if the device
has received my command

31:26.431 --> 31:29.085
or if so it's able
to execute it.

31:30.111 --> 31:30.912
Unacceptable!

31:34.047 --> 31:37.181
What do we do now?

31:37.183 --> 31:37.984
We wait?

31:43.711 --> 31:47.743
Do you think it's like a bomb?

31:50.304 --> 31:51.454
Do bombs talk?

31:51.456 --> 31:52.254
I don't know, maybe.

31:52.256 --> 31:54.077
Diagnostic complete.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.582
It appears an
electromagnetic pulse

31:55.584 --> 31:57.502
has disabled my
secondary boosters,

31:57.504 --> 32:00.030
interrupting long distance
flight capabilities.

32:00.032 --> 32:01.982
I am unable to
return to home base.

32:01.984 --> 32:03.869
Where's home base?

32:03.871 --> 32:05.950
That
location is classified.

32:05.952 --> 32:07.485
What are you?

32:07.487 --> 32:09.853
My
technology is proprietary.

32:09.855 --> 32:11.421
What do you do?

32:11.423 --> 32:13.181
I am
capable of many functions.

32:13.183 --> 32:15.488
My priority is to
protect human life.

32:17.343 --> 32:19.101
What's your name?

32:19.103 --> 32:21.182
Your badge says F.R.E.D.I..

32:21.184 --> 32:23.358
Let me guess, classified?

32:23.360 --> 32:26.558
The correct
pronunciation is F.R.E.D.I..

32:26.560 --> 32:29.150
Hi, F.R.E.D.I., I'm
James, this is Danny.

32:29.152 --> 32:30.397
Sup?

32:30.399 --> 32:31.837
Are you lost?

32:31.839 --> 32:34.301
My directive
is undetermined at this time.

32:34.303 --> 32:35.709
What does that mean?

32:35.711 --> 32:37.565
That
information is classified.

32:37.567 --> 32:39.230
You know what, I'm gonna
go on a limb here and say

32:39.232 --> 32:40.670
that this thing is a jerkface.

32:40.672 --> 32:42.238
Okay, don't make it mad.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.901
It could kill you, okay?

32:43.903 --> 32:46.141
One beam, slice
you in half, okay?

32:46.143 --> 32:47.166
That's true.

32:47.168 --> 32:48.160
Slice him.

32:49.024 --> 32:49.821
What?

32:49.823 --> 32:51.197
No.

32:51.199 --> 32:52.830
I found you in the forest.

32:52.832 --> 32:54.652
Do you know how you got there?

32:54.654 --> 32:56.894
I was placed
in hiding by my creator.

32:56.896 --> 32:57.758
In hiding?

32:57.760 --> 32:58.878
Who's your creator?

32:58.880 --> 33:00.477
Someone
is approaching.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.390
I assess their intentions
to be non-hostile.

33:03.392 --> 33:04.481
F.R.E.D.I., hide.

33:05.567 --> 33:08.062
So what, what,
what about, okay.

33:11.679 --> 33:13.216
Hey, I'm gonna go
ahead and turn it in.

33:14.976 --> 33:16.957
Danny, I didn't
know you were here.

33:16.959 --> 33:21.696
Yeah, just helping out my
home skillet with some homework.

33:23.775 --> 33:24.669
Yeah.

33:24.671 --> 33:26.429
- Homework?
- Mmhmm.

33:26.431 --> 33:27.422
Whatcha studying?

33:27.424 --> 33:30.173
- Uh, ge...
- Robotics.

33:30.175 --> 33:31.357
Robotics.

33:31.359 --> 33:32.894
AI, artificial intelligence,

33:32.896 --> 33:34.429
pretty complicated
stuff, you know?

33:34.431 --> 33:36.221
- Robots.
- Sounds pretty advanced.

33:36.223 --> 33:37.151
Yeah, it's, yeah.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.513
- Future stuff.
- Very futuristic, you know?

33:42.784 --> 33:44.801
All right, Dad, I'll
see you in the morning.

33:46.304 --> 33:46.913
Okay.

33:48.255 --> 33:49.629
Goodnight.

33:49.631 --> 33:50.432
Goodnight.

33:55.583 --> 33:56.383
F.R.E.D.I.?

33:58.111 --> 33:59.773
James
hides F.R.E.D.I., too.

33:59.775 --> 34:00.961
Is F.R.E.D.I. in danger?

34:01.984 --> 34:04.061
Oh, well, no, not here.

34:04.063 --> 34:05.692
But out there I don't know.

34:05.694 --> 34:08.094
F.R.E.D.I.
will remain here in safety.

34:08.096 --> 34:09.632
I think that's a good idea.

34:12.735 --> 34:15.422
Oh, uh, I gotta
go, dude, sorry.

34:15.424 --> 34:16.317
What, you're leaving?

34:16.319 --> 34:17.533
Now?

34:17.534 --> 34:19.484
Well, if I'm not
home in 10 my mom

34:19.485 --> 34:21.277
will ground me till summer, so.

34:21.279 --> 34:22.333
I was hoping we could
take F.R.E.D.I. out

34:22.335 --> 34:23.933
for a spin, see what she can do.

34:23.935 --> 34:25.632
F.R.E.D.I. can spin.

34:26.848 --> 34:27.869
She can spin!

34:29.888 --> 34:31.868
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
F.R.E.D.I., give it a rest.

34:31.870 --> 34:34.465
F.R.E.D.I.
will rest as instructed.

34:35.647 --> 34:36.639
Entering sleep mode.

34:38.590 --> 34:42.333
This has been a
truly incredible day,

34:42.335 --> 34:44.253
but I need to go, so.

34:44.255 --> 34:46.462
How can you sleep
at a time like this?

34:46.464 --> 34:47.931
Easy.

34:47.934 --> 34:48.799
You should try it.

34:50.239 --> 34:51.103
Later!

34:52.511 --> 34:54.016
Text me if anything happens.

35:04.415 --> 35:06.144
We're never gonna have
this done by Monday.

35:15.070 --> 35:16.605
Night, F.R.E.D.I..

35:16.607 --> 35:18.976
Goodnight, James.

35:35.743 --> 35:37.726
Good morning, James.

35:37.728 --> 35:38.560
F.R.E.D.I.?

35:46.688 --> 35:47.902
No way.

35:47.904 --> 35:49.245
I noticed
you were having trouble

35:49.247 --> 35:50.718
completing your paper
on climate change.

35:50.720 --> 35:53.085
I took the liberty of
completing it for you.

35:54.624 --> 35:55.614
Oh, well, one second.

35:55.616 --> 35:57.916
F.R.E.D.I., I need you to hide.

35:57.918 --> 35:58.879
Okay.

36:05.792 --> 36:06.591
Come in.

36:08.671 --> 36:09.757
What was that?

36:09.759 --> 36:10.560
What was what?

36:11.615 --> 36:12.449
I heard voices.

36:13.278 --> 36:14.302
Voices?

36:14.304 --> 36:15.104
Yeah.

36:18.239 --> 36:20.320
Uh, it was probably
just the radio.

36:28.000 --> 36:28.831
Are you kidding me?

36:29.888 --> 36:32.414
Come on, it's a
complete mess in here.

36:32.416 --> 36:33.917
Would it kill you
to clean your room,

36:33.919 --> 36:35.294
I don't know, every
once in awhile?

36:35.296 --> 36:37.117
Yes, as a matter of
fact, it would kill me.

36:37.119 --> 36:38.558
You know how many
toxic chemicals

36:38.560 --> 36:40.412
are in disinfectant solutions?

36:40.414 --> 36:43.454
Not to mention the trip
hazard over the vacuum cord.

36:43.456 --> 36:45.821
Or the risk of getting
tangled in dirty bed sheets.

36:45.823 --> 36:47.965
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, whatever.

36:47.967 --> 36:49.694
Okay, you fix this.

36:49.696 --> 36:50.750
We got an open house
Sunday afternoon,

36:50.752 --> 36:53.725
we'll never get an offer
with it looking like this.

36:53.727 --> 36:54.495
Fine by me.

36:56.639 --> 36:58.782
Hey, this move's gonna be good

36:58.784 --> 37:01.440
for the both of us, you'll see.

37:04.735 --> 37:06.111
Good for you.

37:08.862 --> 37:10.461
Stay here, I gotta
get ready for school.

37:10.463 --> 37:11.806
Okay, James.

37:11.808 --> 37:13.981
I'm detecting a reduced
serotonin level.

37:13.983 --> 37:14.975
Are you feeling okay?

37:15.999 --> 37:16.799
Yeah, fine.

37:43.935 --> 37:45.501
What the?

37:45.503 --> 37:46.368
F.R.E.D.I.?

37:47.423 --> 37:48.476
Did you do this?

37:48.478 --> 37:49.693
Affirmative.

37:49.695 --> 37:51.135
F.R.E.D.I. did not
want James to die.

37:52.096 --> 37:52.897
Huh?

37:54.048 --> 37:55.133
Would it kill you
to clean your room,

37:55.135 --> 37:57.277
I don't know, once in awhile?

37:57.279 --> 38:00.126
Oh, right, but, that's
just a figure of speech,

38:00.128 --> 38:01.121
I wouldn't of really.

38:01.984 --> 38:03.198
Nevermind, thanks, F.R.E.D.I..

38:03.200 --> 38:04.829
You're
welcome, James.

38:04.831 --> 38:07.679
I wanna keep you safe, so
don't forget the ground rules.

38:08.768 --> 38:11.421
Remember, nobody
can see or hear you.

38:11.423 --> 38:12.764
Observing
your natural habitat

38:12.766 --> 38:14.621
will increase my
abilities to assist you

38:14.623 --> 38:17.053
in maintaining a
safe environment.

38:17.055 --> 38:18.397
Just as long as
you do your observing

38:18.399 --> 38:19.295
without being seen.

38:34.751 --> 38:36.797
Incoming
threat detected.

38:36.799 --> 38:38.140
What?

38:38.142 --> 38:39.166
What's going on?

38:39.168 --> 38:42.077
Oh, poor baby's all alone.

38:42.079 --> 38:43.005
Let's get him.

38:45.151 --> 38:47.388
Anti-attack mode engaged.

38:47.390 --> 38:49.341
Level two defense commencing.

38:49.343 --> 38:52.861
Increasing speed, use of
safety gear is advised.

38:52.863 --> 38:54.656
It's a little
late for that now.

38:56.671 --> 38:57.662
Whoa!

38:57.664 --> 38:58.589
How is he doing that?

38:58.591 --> 38:59.901
Dude, go faster.

38:59.903 --> 39:00.735
He's getting away.

39:02.464 --> 39:03.326
You better not post this.

39:03.328 --> 39:05.086
What, come on, this
is an exciting day.

39:05.088 --> 39:06.015
Just say something.

39:07.359 --> 39:08.860
First day in the new ride.

39:08.862 --> 39:10.429
Woohoo, freedom!

39:13.696 --> 39:14.813
Prepare for olly.

39:14.815 --> 39:15.935
You know how to olly?

39:23.584 --> 39:24.575
Whoa!

39:33.247 --> 39:34.430
Wow.

39:34.432 --> 39:36.252
Oh my god, isn't
that guy in our science class?

39:36.254 --> 39:37.950
Laser on.

39:37.952 --> 39:38.942
Locked.

39:38.944 --> 39:39.965
Activated.

39:46.911 --> 39:47.680
Oh crap!

39:52.192 --> 39:54.365
Threat eliminated.

39:54.367 --> 39:55.967
That was insane.

40:05.824 --> 40:07.485
Hey, is that that guy?

40:07.487 --> 40:08.766
The one
in Mallory's video?

40:08.768 --> 40:11.198
- Yeah, he did a crazy olly.
- Pound it, bro.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.544
Man, that jump was sick.

40:14.494 --> 40:17.342
Dude, everyone's
talking about you.

40:17.344 --> 40:18.141
Oh really?

40:18.143 --> 40:18.973
I hadn't noticed.

40:18.975 --> 40:19.965
Yeah.

40:19.967 --> 40:21.758
They're saying you jumped
15 feet over a bench

40:21.760 --> 40:23.261
and nearly got Bruce arrested.

40:23.263 --> 40:26.077
Technically Bruce nearly
got himself arrested

40:26.079 --> 40:28.477
with a little help
from F.R.E.D.I..

40:28.479 --> 40:30.784
Wait, did F.R.E.D.I.
go after Bruce?

40:31.744 --> 40:33.662
It was
a defensive maneuver.

40:33.664 --> 40:35.294
F.R.E.D.I., shh.

40:35.296 --> 40:37.150
You brought that
thing to school?

40:37.152 --> 40:38.301
I just, yeah, it's fine.

40:38.303 --> 40:39.356
It's a half-day.

40:39.358 --> 40:42.301
Each solar
day is exactly 24 hours.

40:42.303 --> 40:43.104
Quiet.

40:44.223 --> 40:46.172
James, this is bad, okay?

40:46.174 --> 40:47.388
Do you not get that?

40:47.390 --> 40:50.205
This is some sort
of defense bot.

40:50.207 --> 40:51.676
People are gonna
come looking for it.

40:51.678 --> 40:52.861
I'm not
gonna let them find her

40:52.863 --> 40:55.133
and I'm not giving her back.

40:55.135 --> 40:57.340
Did you bump your head doing

40:57.342 --> 40:58.621
that stupid stunt this morning?

40:58.623 --> 40:59.519
I'm just curious.

41:00.607 --> 41:02.110
I've never felt better.

41:02.112 --> 41:03.261
This is the best day of my life

41:03.263 --> 41:05.436
and I don't intend
on wasting it.

41:05.438 --> 41:07.199
Hey, sweet move, bro.

41:08.318 --> 41:09.120
Oh.

41:10.238 --> 41:11.324
Hey, you wanna come
with me after school

41:11.326 --> 41:13.053
to see what F.R.E.D.I. can do?

41:13.055 --> 41:14.717
I can't.

41:14.719 --> 41:17.596
Me and the science class are
raising money for stem camp.

41:17.598 --> 41:19.967
So I'm tutoring students after
class to help contribute.

41:22.592 --> 41:24.701
And I actually wanted
to talk to you about

41:24.703 --> 41:26.431
who exactly I'm tutoring.

41:27.359 --> 41:29.212
Yeah, who is it?

41:29.214 --> 41:32.189
It's, it's, it's a girl.

41:32.191 --> 41:35.229
Well, well, well,
nice going, brother.

41:35.231 --> 41:36.221
Uh, who is she?

41:36.223 --> 41:37.821
Do I know her?

41:37.823 --> 41:38.973
Uh.

41:38.975 --> 41:39.806
Hey, guys.

41:39.808 --> 41:40.797
Hey.

41:40.799 --> 41:42.337
See you this afternoon, Danny.

41:43.742 --> 41:44.703
See y'all.

41:46.271 --> 41:47.613
Natalie?

41:47.615 --> 41:48.893
My Natalie?

41:48.895 --> 41:51.453
It's not what you think, dude.

41:51.455 --> 41:52.479
Nice, we gotta go.

41:54.655 --> 41:55.360
Really?

41:56.479 --> 41:57.440
James!

42:10.240 --> 42:10.941
Sir?

42:10.943 --> 42:12.220
Look, excuse the interruption,

42:12.222 --> 42:13.436
but I've been
running some tests on

42:13.438 --> 42:15.549
the virtual model of
F.R.E.D.I. and um...

42:15.551 --> 42:16.352
Move.

42:19.424 --> 42:20.797
You've been doing what?

42:20.799 --> 42:22.173
Running some tests
on the virtual model...

42:22.175 --> 42:25.085
Well that sounds like
a massive waste of time

42:25.087 --> 42:26.910
and resources, isn't it?

42:26.912 --> 42:27.805
With all due respect,
I think you're gonna

42:27.807 --> 42:28.956
wanna take a look at this.

42:28.958 --> 42:30.494
- Am I?
- Yes.

42:30.496 --> 42:31.677
See, right here.

42:31.679 --> 42:33.308
So, back in phase one of
development we created

42:33.310 --> 42:35.452
this um, this virtual
model that we can do

42:35.454 --> 42:36.573
- some, you know,
- Yes.

42:36.575 --> 42:37.853
Hypothetic goal
testing without any

42:37.855 --> 42:39.549
- real work consequences.
- Oh.

42:39.551 --> 42:41.276
Well, why in the
real world would

42:41.278 --> 42:43.965
I even care about any of this?

42:43.967 --> 42:45.149
It is the question, isn't it?

42:45.151 --> 42:46.748
- Yes, that is
- Right.

42:46.750 --> 42:48.060
A good question and I
have your answer right here.

42:48.062 --> 42:50.109
See, this is the model
for the hydrogen core

42:50.111 --> 42:51.709
that the F.R.E.D.I.
prototype uses

42:51.711 --> 42:53.821
for the fuel cell along
with the internal shielding

42:53.823 --> 42:56.448
system that we in place
for a stabilizing.

42:57.599 --> 42:59.676
Well, it appears that
the shielding is failing.

43:01.472 --> 43:03.325
All right, without all
the scientific gibberish,

43:03.327 --> 43:06.237
just tell me what you
actually mean in English.

43:06.239 --> 43:08.989
Well, um, see, the
lower the numbers go,

43:08.991 --> 43:10.206
the faster it drops.

43:10.208 --> 43:12.060
We call it the Omega Error.

43:12.062 --> 43:14.271
Ooh, the Omega Error.

43:15.519 --> 43:16.926
Oh, I do like the sound of that.

43:16.928 --> 43:18.784
Has a certain ring
to it, doesn't it?

43:19.839 --> 43:20.704
Omega Error.

43:22.718 --> 43:25.244
What happens when it
goes all the way to zero?

43:25.246 --> 43:29.181
Oh no, everything within
400 meters would incinerate.

43:32.831 --> 43:33.917
Sounds wonderful.

43:33.919 --> 43:36.188
- Uh huh, wonderful?
- Yes.

43:36.190 --> 43:38.815
- Well, it would be...
- Carry on.

43:43.807 --> 43:45.374
Why
are we in the forest?

43:45.376 --> 43:46.880
I wanted to take
you out for a spin.

43:48.287 --> 43:50.016
No, no, no, you
can stop spinning.

43:51.070 --> 43:52.412
Just wanted to see
what else you could do.

43:52.414 --> 43:53.341
- I
- am programmed to do

43:53.343 --> 43:55.996
over 10,000 different tasks.

43:55.998 --> 43:56.799
Show me.

44:16.063 --> 44:17.343
Three, two, one!

44:19.936 --> 44:21.920
Ready, I'm gonna get ya.

44:29.184 --> 44:29.983
Ow!

44:40.478 --> 44:43.519
This
won't sting a bit.

44:49.662 --> 44:50.272
Whoa!

45:10.143 --> 45:13.372
All right, F.R.E.D.I.,
how high can you go?

45:24.831 --> 45:25.632
Yes!

45:32.478 --> 45:34.077
That was amazing.

45:34.079 --> 45:35.901
Caution, Omega Error.

45:35.903 --> 45:38.973
Power cell depletion,
possible source meltdown.

45:38.975 --> 45:39.964
F.R.E.D.I.?

45:39.966 --> 45:40.893
What is Omega Error?

45:40.895 --> 45:41.949
Are you hurt?

45:41.951 --> 45:42.845
F.R.E.D.I.'s power cell

45:42.847 --> 45:44.736
capacity is depleted by half.

45:45.886 --> 45:47.709
Someone is approaching.

45:47.711 --> 45:49.055
I will scan the area.

45:50.526 --> 45:52.380
Scan complete.

45:52.382 --> 45:55.356
I detect two individuals
with hostile intentions.

45:55.358 --> 45:57.501
Their bioscans are
logged in my database.

45:57.503 --> 45:58.302
Let's go.

46:05.470 --> 46:07.485
Hey,
Williams, get over here.

46:07.487 --> 46:08.640
What do ya got?

46:10.655 --> 46:12.541
What is this?

46:12.543 --> 46:14.333
I don't know,
looks like some fort.

46:14.335 --> 46:16.256
How did
we miss this last time?

46:17.439 --> 46:19.325
I detect an
increase in your heart rate

46:19.327 --> 46:21.085
consistent with extreme stress.

46:21.087 --> 46:21.885
Quiet!

46:24.639 --> 46:25.247
Hello?

46:26.143 --> 46:26.976
Sir, is that you?

46:28.862 --> 46:29.725
Sir, I can't hear you,
you're breaking up.

46:29.727 --> 46:31.680
It sounds like you
want to release her.

46:32.671 --> 46:33.663
Really?

46:34.623 --> 46:36.413
Oh, right away.

46:36.415 --> 46:38.172
What's up?

46:38.174 --> 46:40.317
Grant wants to release Palmer.

46:40.319 --> 46:41.244
We need to go.

46:41.246 --> 46:42.175
Okay.

46:47.039 --> 46:48.060
Who are those people?

46:48.062 --> 46:49.725
F.R.E.D.I.
previously encountered

46:49.727 --> 46:51.072
them during my field trials.

46:52.254 --> 46:53.821
Is that where you came from?

46:53.823 --> 46:55.837
And don't tell me
it's classified.

46:55.839 --> 46:57.661
I won't
tell you it's classified.

46:57.663 --> 46:58.492
So tell me.

46:58.494 --> 46:59.836
I can't.

46:59.838 --> 47:01.503
Fine, I'll look it up myself.

47:03.551 --> 47:04.351
Hey!

47:06.239 --> 47:07.997
We are
likely under surveillance.

47:07.999 --> 47:09.885
Searches related to
F.R.E.D.I. may be traced

47:09.887 --> 47:10.973
to your IP address.

47:10.975 --> 47:13.916
I recommend using a public
access point for research.

47:17.535 --> 47:20.572
So tell me why we
can't just leave her here again?

47:20.574 --> 47:22.301
The Constitution.

47:22.303 --> 47:23.677
- Right.
- Enough.

47:23.679 --> 47:25.244
I've decided.

47:25.246 --> 47:26.396
We're going to let her go.

47:26.398 --> 47:27.548
She's not giving
us anything anyway.

47:27.550 --> 47:30.333
Yeah, so
just let her go again.

47:30.335 --> 47:31.200
Exactly.

47:32.350 --> 47:34.909
And then I want you to
trace her every move.

47:34.911 --> 47:35.997
Right,
because it won't be long

47:35.999 --> 47:38.300
before she heads
straight to the gadget.

47:38.302 --> 47:39.936
That's
what I'm counting on.

48:03.039 --> 48:04.828
Yeah, you know,
that's super helpful.

48:04.830 --> 48:05.885
I totally get it now.

48:05.887 --> 48:08.924
Yeah, uh, there's a ton
of little tricks like that.

48:08.926 --> 48:11.805
Here, see these phylum
classifications?

48:11.807 --> 48:15.708
It looks really overwhelming
when you see them all at once,

48:15.710 --> 48:18.364
but if you break them
down first by vertebrae

48:18.366 --> 48:21.308
and nonvertebrae and
then by the environments

48:21.310 --> 48:23.677
in which they reside it's
easier to break them down

48:23.679 --> 48:24.989
and attack it that way.

48:24.991 --> 48:26.653
- So let's start...
- Can I ask you a question?

48:26.655 --> 48:27.868
Yeah, of course.

48:27.870 --> 48:29.823
Isn't that why I'm getting
paid the big bucks?

48:30.975 --> 48:34.239
Um, what's the deal
with your friend James?

48:38.270 --> 48:39.935
I am, I don't know.

48:41.471 --> 48:42.336
What do you mean?

48:43.487 --> 48:47.069
You know, like is he single,
does he have a girlfriend?

48:51.038 --> 48:51.837
James?

48:51.839 --> 48:52.829
I was just asking.

48:52.831 --> 48:54.336
You know, for a friend.

48:55.550 --> 48:56.636
Nevermind.

48:56.638 --> 48:58.333
Uh.

48:58.335 --> 48:59.485
- So.
- Let's uh,

48:59.487 --> 49:01.088
let's get back to this.

49:02.399 --> 49:03.424
So a lot of these
equations look, uh.

49:07.071 --> 49:08.829
What was that?

49:08.831 --> 49:12.576
Uh, just some kid.

49:13.663 --> 49:15.584
Let's get back to
these classifications.

49:47.679 --> 49:50.560
Future robotics engineered
design innovation.

49:51.487 --> 49:53.117
F.R.E.D.I..

49:53.119 --> 49:54.621
F.R.E.D.I., you're a star.

49:54.623 --> 49:56.060
F.R.E.D.I. is not a star.

49:56.062 --> 49:58.237
A star is a luminous
collection of hydrogen

49:58.239 --> 50:00.924
and helium held together
by its own gravity.

50:00.926 --> 50:02.013
Shh, you gotta keep quiet.

50:02.015 --> 50:03.677
We're in the library.

51:03.071 --> 51:05.180
Hi, there.

51:05.182 --> 51:05.984
Hi.

51:06.590 --> 51:07.964
What's your name?

51:07.966 --> 51:09.471
My
name is F.R.E.D.I..

51:11.998 --> 51:13.694
Bye, robot.

51:25.214 --> 51:27.452
You know, this is a
complete waste of time.

51:27.454 --> 51:28.541
I been sitting
here for like hours

51:28.543 --> 51:30.941
and now my butt is numb.

51:30.943 --> 51:32.412
I mean, it's not like
Palmer's gonna waltz

51:32.414 --> 51:34.205
through her front door
in broad daylight.

51:34.207 --> 51:35.100
Come on!

51:35.102 --> 51:36.283
Well, if you hadn't lost her,

51:36.285 --> 51:37.821
you wouldn't be
on stakeout duty.

51:37.823 --> 51:38.908
Well if she wasn't
driving like a maniac

51:38.910 --> 51:40.092
I wouldn't have lost her.

51:40.094 --> 51:40.926
Be patient.

51:42.974 --> 51:45.564
Wow, be patient, yeah, okay.

51:45.566 --> 51:47.644
I'll show you how to be patient.

52:06.814 --> 52:07.870
F.R.E.D.I.?

52:12.894 --> 52:13.821
F.R.E.D.I.?

52:13.823 --> 52:15.517
Where are you?

52:15.519 --> 52:16.415
F.R.E.D.I.?

52:17.982 --> 52:18.879
F.R.E.D.I.?

52:55.839 --> 52:57.597
Oh, you mustn't reshelve
the books yourself,

52:57.599 --> 52:59.676
you'll muddle the system.

52:59.678 --> 53:00.606
Let me do it.

53:06.879 --> 53:07.903
F.R.E.D.I..

53:09.246 --> 53:11.869
Young man, this is a
library, not a racetrack.

53:11.871 --> 53:13.663
Yes, ma'am, sorry about that.

53:20.862 --> 53:21.947
How'd you do that?

53:21.949 --> 53:23.292
F.R.E.D.I. is equipped

53:23.294 --> 53:24.540
with a cloaking device
to evade detection

53:24.542 --> 53:26.813
in hostile circumstances.

53:26.815 --> 53:28.093
Amazing.

53:28.095 --> 53:29.276
Caution, Omega Error.

53:29.278 --> 53:31.390
Current power 45%.

53:33.375 --> 53:35.164
Hey, I found a burst of
F.R.E.D.I.-related searches

53:35.166 --> 53:37.981
originating from an IP
address at the public library.

53:37.983 --> 53:39.964
I'm headed over there now.

53:39.966 --> 53:40.892
Yeah.

53:40.894 --> 53:41.664
Bye.

53:44.925 --> 53:46.685
Yeah, no, no, you're
getting it, you're getting it.

53:46.687 --> 53:48.796
Just keep doing,
keep doing that.

53:48.798 --> 53:50.173
Real simplified.

53:50.175 --> 53:51.581
I need to talk
to you, like now.

53:51.583 --> 53:53.311
Can you not wait
until we're done?

53:54.463 --> 53:56.155
Come on.

53:56.157 --> 53:58.845
No, it's okay, we
could wrap up things now.

53:58.847 --> 54:00.061
And I could give you guys

54:00.063 --> 54:01.148
a ride home in my
car if you'd like.

54:01.150 --> 54:02.267
You have a car?

54:02.269 --> 54:03.708
Sweet.

54:03.710 --> 54:05.596
So, where am I
taking you guys?

54:05.598 --> 54:08.636
Uh, Arachnacorp, it's
by the tech complex.

54:08.638 --> 54:11.355
Off the freeway and
by the pause exit.

54:11.357 --> 54:12.639
So a science lab?

54:13.534 --> 54:15.452
Uh, it's for a
science project.

54:15.454 --> 54:17.532
Whole life's a
science project.

54:27.999 --> 54:29.885
Don't do that.

54:29.887 --> 54:30.847
Delivery?

54:33.631 --> 54:35.519
I have a delivery
for a Mr. Brody.

54:36.639 --> 54:38.716
Um, I'm Mr. Brody.

54:38.718 --> 54:40.092
Tazikis.

54:40.094 --> 54:41.019
Tazikis?

54:41.021 --> 54:41.916
- Yeah.
- Tazikis?

54:41.918 --> 54:43.132
That's my favorite.

54:43.134 --> 54:44.573
I mean, I don't have any
cash on me at the moment

54:44.575 --> 54:45.949
so I don't know how
I'm gonna pay you.

54:45.951 --> 54:47.071
It's been taken care of.

54:48.766 --> 54:50.685
It must be the
guys at the station.

54:50.687 --> 54:51.644
I love those guys.

55:54.942 --> 55:57.276
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

55:57.278 --> 55:58.078
No.

56:23.741 --> 56:25.884
What's your business
here today, kids?

56:25.886 --> 56:27.708
Um, I'm just dropping off...

56:27.710 --> 56:29.821
Morning, we're
just headed over

56:29.823 --> 56:31.805
to scout out the
tech park sidewalks

56:31.807 --> 56:33.531
for some sweet spots to ride.

56:33.533 --> 56:34.716
- I don't think so.
- Why?

56:34.718 --> 56:35.933
Skateboarding is not a crime.

56:35.935 --> 56:37.339
It's a free country.

56:37.341 --> 56:39.291
But this is a secured area.

56:39.293 --> 56:40.094
Since when?

56:41.021 --> 56:42.588
It's just a business park.

56:42.590 --> 56:43.996
What's going on?

56:43.998 --> 56:46.109
I want you kids to
turn this car around

56:46.111 --> 56:46.972
and get out of here now.

56:46.974 --> 56:49.629
Okay, yeah, we don't
want any trouble.

56:49.631 --> 56:50.876
Wait a second.

56:50.878 --> 56:52.476
You.

56:52.478 --> 56:53.084
Me?

56:53.086 --> 56:54.908
Yeah, you, Tony Hawk.

56:54.910 --> 56:55.775
What's in the bag?

56:56.894 --> 56:59.549
Uh, it's just uh,
it's just school stuff.

56:59.551 --> 57:00.348
I need to see it.

57:00.350 --> 57:01.405
We don't want
any trouble, okay?

57:01.407 --> 57:02.268
Can we just go?

57:02.270 --> 57:03.071
Open the bag.

57:07.902 --> 57:09.983
I'm gonna unzip the bag.

57:11.006 --> 57:11.902
Doing that now.

57:13.917 --> 57:14.687
Here I go.

57:22.271 --> 57:24.508
All righty, then, on your way.

57:24.510 --> 57:26.524
And I don't wanna see
any of you here again.

57:26.526 --> 57:27.325
Got it?

57:27.327 --> 57:28.127
You can count on that.

57:48.798 --> 57:50.334
Why did you lie to that guy?

57:52.477 --> 57:53.406
What's going on?

57:56.318 --> 57:58.172
Will somebody tell
me what's going on?

57:58.174 --> 57:59.039
Okay, James?

58:00.158 --> 58:02.655
Look, I know this is
your thing or whatever.

58:03.582 --> 58:04.798
What are we gonna do, man?

58:06.110 --> 58:08.508
Okay, listen, I
wasn't going to the lab

58:08.510 --> 58:09.981
for a science project.

58:09.983 --> 58:12.127
I just, I think.

58:13.566 --> 58:15.771
I think I found
something really amazing

58:15.773 --> 58:18.271
and I need to talk to a
certain person about it.

58:19.485 --> 58:22.876
Are you guys in trouble,
is it something dangerous?

58:22.878 --> 58:23.679
No.

58:24.349 --> 58:25.659
Well, not exactly.

58:25.661 --> 58:26.942
Whoa.

58:29.086 --> 58:29.887
Great.

58:44.382 --> 58:46.239
I have a spare in the trunk.

58:56.415 --> 58:59.645
Yeah, got a spare back
here but no tire iron.

58:59.647 --> 59:00.861
Or a jack.

59:00.863 --> 59:02.525
My dad was just
teaching me how

59:02.527 --> 59:03.421
to fix a flat tire and I guess

59:03.423 --> 59:05.371
I just didn't put any
of it back in there.

59:05.373 --> 59:06.142
How ironic.

59:07.261 --> 59:08.349
And I can't call
them because I'm only

59:08.351 --> 59:11.356
supposed to be driving to
and from school and practice.

59:11.358 --> 59:13.020
Don't look at me.

59:13.022 --> 59:14.652
My mom will literally kill me
if she finds out I'm out here.

59:14.654 --> 59:16.092
What about Mallory,
can we call her?

59:16.094 --> 59:17.788
She's at dance class.

59:17.790 --> 59:20.604
Besides, she only has
her learner's permit.

59:20.606 --> 59:21.787
But I guess I could call Bruce.

59:21.789 --> 59:23.548
- No.
- No, no.

59:23.550 --> 59:24.542
My dad's at his shop.

59:25.438 --> 59:27.358
He's not far, he can
bring us tools over.

59:29.311 --> 59:30.268
All right, let's
get this tire.

59:30.270 --> 59:31.324
Hey, Dad.

59:31.326 --> 59:33.819
I'm with Danny and a friend.

59:33.821 --> 59:36.158
We need your help fixing
a tire, call me back.

59:37.598 --> 59:38.655
So now I'm a friend?

59:40.222 --> 59:41.022
I hope so.

59:45.341 --> 59:46.364
Hey, Dad.

59:46.366 --> 59:48.509
Where are you and who's
car are you riding in?

59:48.511 --> 59:50.364
It's a long story,
I can explain.

59:50.366 --> 59:51.996
Tire trouble?

59:52.703 --> 59:54.235
Maybe I can help.

59:54.237 --> 59:55.036
What the heck is that?

59:55.038 --> 59:56.860
Who was that,
who was screaming?

59:56.862 --> 59:58.813
Uh nevermind, Dad, Auto
Club is here, gotta go.

59:58.815 --> 01:00:00.092
No, no, James,
don't you hang up on...

01:00:01.343 --> 01:00:03.292
I guess the cat's
outta the bag now.

01:00:03.294 --> 01:00:05.087
Or robots outta the bag.

01:00:06.077 --> 01:00:07.580
Is that a bad, okay.

01:00:07.582 --> 01:00:08.510
Is this your robot?

01:00:09.342 --> 01:00:11.515
Um yeah, I guess so.

01:00:11.517 --> 01:00:12.667
Her name's F.R.E.D.I..

01:00:12.669 --> 01:00:14.269
Who knows about this thing?

01:00:14.271 --> 01:00:15.323
No one.

01:00:15.325 --> 01:00:16.220
Just the three of us.

01:00:16.222 --> 01:00:18.428
And Dr. Palmer, so
you can't tell anybody.

01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:19.229
Excuse me for a second.

01:00:19.231 --> 01:00:20.380
Who's Dr. Palmer?

01:00:20.382 --> 01:00:21.915
Dr.
Palmer is my creator.

01:00:21.917 --> 01:00:23.739
I received a warning
from her advising

01:00:23.741 --> 01:00:25.308
us to leave Arachnacorp.

01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:26.331
Warning?

01:00:26.333 --> 01:00:27.132
What warning?

01:00:27.134 --> 01:00:28.669
Is this thing dangerous?

01:00:28.671 --> 01:00:30.140
F.R.E.D.I.
is not dangerous.

01:00:30.142 --> 01:00:31.900
My directive is to help people.

01:00:31.902 --> 01:00:33.595
I can help you.

01:00:33.597 --> 01:00:35.549
Me, oh, you wanna help me?

01:00:35.551 --> 01:00:36.702
Do your thing, F.R.E.D.I..

01:00:40.318 --> 01:00:42.331
The tire
appears to be flat.

01:00:42.333 --> 01:00:44.219
Do you have a spare
tire in the vehicle?

01:00:44.221 --> 01:00:45.212
It's talking to me.

01:00:45.214 --> 01:00:47.069
So talk back.

01:00:47.071 --> 01:00:49.915
Um, I have a spare
but I don't seem

01:00:49.917 --> 01:00:52.540
to have a jack or a tire iron.

01:00:52.542 --> 01:00:53.758
Not a problem.

01:00:56.861 --> 01:00:58.588
Are you
guys seeing this?

01:00:58.590 --> 01:00:59.806
Unbelievable.

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:08.251
- No, no, no.
- Stop, what are you doing?

01:01:08.253 --> 01:01:09.308
What's the big deal?

01:01:09.310 --> 01:01:11.068
Okay, this is amazing.

01:01:11.070 --> 01:01:12.284
You guys said it
wasn't dangerous.

01:01:12.286 --> 01:01:14.075
I said F.R.E.D.I.'s
not dangerous.

01:01:14.077 --> 01:01:16.700
I don't know about the people
who are looking for her.

01:01:16.702 --> 01:01:18.108
So you are in trouble.

01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:18.911
We.

01:01:20.542 --> 01:01:21.820
We are in trouble.

01:01:21.822 --> 01:01:23.484
Excuse me?

01:01:23.486 --> 01:01:26.108
Well, actually, now you
know as much as we do.

01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:28.315
Oh no, nope, nope,
nope, I'm taking you two

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:30.172
and this tin can home now.

01:01:30.174 --> 01:01:32.095
I'm afraid it's a
little too late for that.

01:01:37.278 --> 01:01:38.812
Oh, go ahead.

01:01:38.814 --> 01:01:41.211
No, I'm good, I need something
a little higher octane.

01:01:41.213 --> 01:01:42.716
Bad day?

01:01:42.718 --> 01:01:44.891
I have been on a wild
goose chase from one

01:01:44.893 --> 01:01:46.651
end of this town to the other.

01:01:46.653 --> 01:01:48.156
Yeah, you wouldn't
believe what we've seen

01:01:48.158 --> 01:01:49.339
at the front gate today.

01:01:49.341 --> 01:01:52.956
Wrong deliveries, lost
interns, nosy teenagers.

01:01:52.958 --> 01:01:54.652
Nosy teenagers out here?

01:01:54.654 --> 01:01:55.455
What'd they want?

01:02:05.822 --> 01:02:06.812
Repair complete.

01:02:06.814 --> 01:02:08.987
The manufacturer suggests
limiting your speed

01:02:08.989 --> 01:02:10.811
to 50 miles per hour.

01:02:10.813 --> 01:02:12.156
Thanks.

01:02:12.158 --> 01:02:13.148
You're
welcome, Natalie.

01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:14.332
She's awesome, isn't she?

01:02:14.334 --> 01:02:15.707
Caution, Omega Error.

01:02:15.709 --> 01:02:17.500
Power cell at 30%.

01:02:17.502 --> 01:02:19.359
Shield at eminent risk.

01:02:21.246 --> 01:02:23.131
What's happening?

01:02:23.133 --> 01:02:25.115
I don't know, it's
the second time today.

01:02:25.117 --> 01:02:26.012
Something's wrong.

01:02:26.014 --> 01:02:28.795
That's why I need to
find this Dr. Palmer.

01:02:28.797 --> 01:02:29.598
Like now.

01:02:49.661 --> 01:02:50.876
Yeah?

01:02:50.878 --> 01:02:52.700
I want you to
see if Palmer's inside.

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:53.503
Okay.

01:03:12.125 --> 01:03:14.043
Dr. Palmer?

01:03:16.798 --> 01:03:17.886
I know you're here.

01:03:20.446 --> 01:03:21.247
Come on.

01:03:22.238 --> 01:03:22.846
Come on out.

01:03:27.453 --> 01:03:28.350
Dr. Palmer?

01:03:38.654 --> 01:03:39.743
Dr. Palmer, come on!

01:03:40.669 --> 01:03:41.855
It's Brody.

01:03:43.133 --> 01:03:44.670
It's your friend.

01:03:49.405 --> 01:03:52.347
Is she there or
isn't she there?

01:03:52.349 --> 01:03:53.531
Huh?

01:03:53.533 --> 01:03:55.004
Gotcha, skater boy.

01:03:55.006 --> 01:03:56.988
You know why I want an
answer to the question?

01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:59.259
Because I want to know how
angry I should be with you...

01:03:59.261 --> 01:04:00.668
Sir?

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:01.372
Hold up.

01:04:01.374 --> 01:04:02.299
I think you should see this.

01:04:02.301 --> 01:04:03.676
Yes?

01:04:03.678 --> 01:04:04.923
I've got a short list
of possible locations.

01:04:04.925 --> 01:04:06.108
Then we'll impart a new one.

01:04:07.358 --> 01:04:08.411
- Awesome, sir.
- How short?

01:04:08.413 --> 01:04:10.620
Um, three
residential addresses.

01:04:10.622 --> 01:04:12.667
How positive are
you about this?

01:04:12.669 --> 01:04:14.204
Fairly positive.

01:04:14.206 --> 01:04:15.323
Fairly positive doesn't
sound good enough.

01:04:15.325 --> 01:04:16.348
Very positive, sir.

01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:18.395
Actually, I'm 100% sure.

01:04:18.397 --> 01:04:19.196
Very good.

01:04:19.198 --> 01:04:21.084
Listen, your partner
here, Williams,

01:04:21.086 --> 01:04:22.747
has got three addresses
and she's going

01:04:22.749 --> 01:04:24.156
to text you them
to you right away,

01:04:24.158 --> 01:04:25.916
I want you to meet us there
and don't mess this up.

01:04:25.918 --> 01:04:27.260
Yes, sir, I'm on my way now.

01:04:27.262 --> 01:04:28.062
Let's go in.

01:04:28.861 --> 01:04:30.430
Get outta my way.

01:04:46.878 --> 01:04:48.059
You know what I don't get?

01:04:48.061 --> 01:04:49.755
How did Palmer
know where we were?

01:04:49.757 --> 01:04:51.164
Or that we were in danger?

01:04:51.166 --> 01:04:52.828
F.R.E.D.I., what
can you tell us about

01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:54.492
the messages from Dr. Palmer?

01:04:54.494 --> 01:04:55.772
Each
message was received

01:04:55.774 --> 01:04:57.851
using a covert messaging
system not disclosed

01:04:57.853 --> 01:04:59.739
in my manualized
program settings.

01:04:59.741 --> 01:05:01.499
So she can talk to you?

01:05:01.501 --> 01:05:02.652
Like in secret?

01:05:02.654 --> 01:05:03.772
- I
- can receive messages

01:05:03.774 --> 01:05:06.043
from Dr. Palmer within
a 10 mile radius

01:05:06.045 --> 01:05:07.963
using the covert
communication system.

01:05:07.965 --> 01:05:09.500
So she's close by.

01:05:09.502 --> 01:05:11.164
Okay, but if that's the case,

01:05:11.166 --> 01:05:13.086
then why haven't we gotten
another message from her?

01:05:14.653 --> 01:05:15.710
I hope she's okay.

01:05:18.110 --> 01:05:19.390
So what do we do now?

01:05:33.245 --> 01:05:34.267
She's good to go on the lease,

01:05:34.269 --> 01:05:35.131
just have her sign right there.

01:05:35.133 --> 01:05:36.125
Hey, Dad.

01:05:37.182 --> 01:05:41.052
Four calls, five
texts, three voicemails.

01:05:41.054 --> 01:05:42.460
I know, I'm sorry.

01:05:42.462 --> 01:05:43.838
You wanna tell
me what's going on here?

01:05:44.924 --> 01:05:47.518
It's a little hard
to know where to start.

01:05:48.573 --> 01:05:51.420
Why don't put this, go
ahead in the break room.

01:05:51.422 --> 01:05:52.287
Not so fast.

01:05:53.277 --> 01:05:54.206
Who are you?

01:05:55.198 --> 01:05:56.894
Uh, I'm Natalie.

01:05:57.821 --> 01:05:58.431
Natalie.

01:05:59.933 --> 01:06:02.780
Natalie, now there's a
name I've heard before.

01:06:02.782 --> 01:06:04.572
You've heard my name?

01:06:04.574 --> 01:06:05.691
Is that you I heard screaming?

01:06:05.693 --> 01:06:06.846
Sure hope it wasn't you.

01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:09.882
No, no, no, no, no,
no sir, it wasn't.

01:06:09.884 --> 01:06:11.612
Yeah, yeah, that was me.

01:06:11.614 --> 01:06:14.559
I was just, I was surprised,
everything was fine.

01:06:15.741 --> 01:06:18.107
I mean everything is
fine, it's all good,

01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:19.516
- nothing weird here...
- Kay, that'll do.

01:06:19.518 --> 01:06:20.959
It was nice to meet you.

01:06:25.918 --> 01:06:26.718
Let's talk.

01:06:33.726 --> 01:06:34.813
Me and Danny were
out in the woods,

01:06:34.815 --> 01:06:37.627
we were looking for something
we saw the night before.

01:06:37.629 --> 01:06:41.210
I found this little
hunting blind and in it was

01:06:41.212 --> 01:06:45.979
this sleeping bag and
F.R.E.D.I. in it so I took it.

01:06:45.981 --> 01:06:47.419
Think it's not dangerous.

01:06:47.421 --> 01:06:50.045
And there's this
scientist, Dr. Palmer,

01:06:50.942 --> 01:06:52.700
she has these people
looking for her

01:06:52.702 --> 01:06:54.683
because I was out,
think they were gonna

01:06:54.685 --> 01:06:56.315
take her and use her for evil.

01:06:56.317 --> 01:06:57.691
Hey, Williams, I'm
sending you an update.

01:06:57.693 --> 01:06:59.868
It's at 16%, that is not good.

01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:01.503
16%, okay?

01:07:02.494 --> 01:07:03.485
Hi, mom.

01:07:05.213 --> 01:07:07.103
Wait, what?

01:07:08.254 --> 01:07:10.235
Some officials came to
my house asking for me.

01:07:10.237 --> 01:07:14.202
Driving, um, and
her tire went out flat

01:07:14.204 --> 01:07:15.646
and that's what you heard.

01:07:20.765 --> 01:07:24.414
Wow, I can't believe you've
been doing all this alone.

01:07:25.725 --> 01:07:28.379
Why didn't you just let me know?

01:07:28.381 --> 01:07:29.948
I didn't wanna bother you.

01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:31.198
Didn't wanna bother me?

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:35.003
You know, with the house
and the shop and all.

01:07:35.005 --> 01:07:37.788
Look, I, James, I know
things have been tough

01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:40.892
and I've been a little
distracted lately,

01:07:40.894 --> 01:07:42.651
but I want you to feel like that

01:07:42.653 --> 01:07:44.763
you can come to
me with anything.

01:07:44.765 --> 01:07:47.516
Even a bazillion-dollar
talking flying robot?

01:07:47.518 --> 01:07:50.270
Yes, even a bazillion-dollar
talking flying robot.

01:07:51.196 --> 01:07:52.955
There's nothing in my life

01:07:52.957 --> 01:07:54.973
that's more important
than you, all right?

01:07:56.925 --> 01:07:58.970
So do you wanna meet her?

01:07:58.972 --> 01:07:59.773
Yeah.

01:08:03.838 --> 01:08:06.715
Look, I really, I don't
know about this, okay?

01:08:06.717 --> 01:08:07.548
I just think that...

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:09.275
I know you're scared.

01:08:09.277 --> 01:08:10.619
It's gonna be okay.

01:08:10.621 --> 01:08:11.613
No.

01:08:18.301 --> 01:08:20.380
F.R.E.D.I., this
is my dad, Randy.

01:08:20.381 --> 01:08:22.430
Hello,
Randy, nice to meet you.

01:08:23.358 --> 01:08:24.923
Incoming call.

01:08:24.925 --> 01:08:25.916
From who?

01:08:25.917 --> 01:08:27.004
Dr. Andi Palmer.

01:08:27.006 --> 01:08:28.859
Dr. Palmer?

01:08:28.861 --> 01:08:29.850
Hello, James.

01:08:29.853 --> 01:08:31.803
You must have so many
questions, as I do for you,

01:08:31.805 --> 01:08:34.651
but the time is short
and the stakes are high

01:08:34.653 --> 01:08:35.675
so let's get right to it.

01:08:37.627 --> 01:08:39.386
I got here as soon as I could.

01:08:39.389 --> 01:08:41.435
Well, this car, I saw
it on the security footage

01:08:41.438 --> 01:08:43.068
when I was viewing the
cameras from the lab.

01:08:43.069 --> 01:08:44.188
Stop!

01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:46.010
Congratulate each other later.

01:08:46.011 --> 01:08:48.635
You, cover the rear just in
case somebody tries to get away.

01:08:48.636 --> 01:08:49.310
Come on, let's go.

01:08:52.862 --> 01:08:54.011
I'll do all the talking.

01:08:54.013 --> 01:08:55.707
Are you sure this
is going to work?

01:08:55.709 --> 01:08:57.979
I'm sure of it, you'll
just have to trust me.

01:08:57.982 --> 01:09:00.475
Dr. Palmer, I need
you to guarantee

01:09:00.478 --> 01:09:02.203
that these kids
are gonna be safe.

01:09:02.205 --> 01:09:03.611
I'm gonna do everything I can.

01:09:03.613 --> 01:09:05.466
F.R.E.D.I.'s also
here to keep you safe.

01:09:05.469 --> 01:09:08.475
She excels in risk management
in dire circumstances.

01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:10.875
So ask for her help
whenever you need it.

01:09:10.877 --> 01:09:12.221
Okay, everybody know the plan?

01:09:13.982 --> 01:09:15.707
Three
hostiles are approaching.

01:09:15.710 --> 01:09:18.555
One in the back and two
heading for the front door.

01:09:18.557 --> 01:09:19.358
Stay here.

01:09:24.252 --> 01:09:26.749
Looks like one really
angry guy in a suit

01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:30.938
and one gal who
apparently hates her job.

01:09:30.939 --> 01:09:32.346
That's Grant and
one of his lackeys.

01:09:32.349 --> 01:09:33.948
They're here for F.R.E.D.I..

01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:35.067
It's game time.

01:09:39.932 --> 01:09:41.758
Randy Nash, please.

01:09:43.742 --> 01:09:45.337
Randy Nash?

01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:47.515
Yes, Cat, you can go ahead
and take your lunch, thank you.

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:49.307
Welcome to Phat Tire,
how can I help you?

01:09:49.309 --> 01:09:51.484
We'd like to speak
to your son, James.

01:09:51.486 --> 01:09:52.283
James, what about?

01:09:52.285 --> 01:09:54.299
We believe that
he is in possession

01:09:54.301 --> 01:09:56.157
of a highly dangerous machine.

01:09:57.246 --> 01:09:58.459
I'm sorry, who are you?

01:09:58.461 --> 01:09:59.771
It's a matter of
national security.

01:09:59.773 --> 01:10:01.150
Homeland Security.

01:10:02.302 --> 01:10:04.734
Okay, I'd like to
see some ID please.

01:10:09.021 --> 01:10:11.643
Oh, weapons manufacturing.

01:10:11.645 --> 01:10:13.756
It's highly classified work.

01:10:13.758 --> 01:10:16.059
So, what makes
you think that James

01:10:16.061 --> 01:10:18.395
is in possession of this, what?

01:10:18.397 --> 01:10:19.356
Machine.

01:10:19.358 --> 01:10:20.158
Machine.

01:10:21.501 --> 01:10:23.034
How on Earth are
we supposed to get

01:10:23.036 --> 01:10:25.372
out of here without being seen?

01:10:25.374 --> 01:10:26.747
You're worried
about getting busted?

01:10:26.749 --> 01:10:28.445
You'll be grounded
till you're 50.

01:10:30.556 --> 01:10:33.979
Look, I don't care
about that anymore, okay?

01:10:33.981 --> 01:10:35.679
I just wanna do what's right.

01:10:36.669 --> 01:10:38.207
Okay, so, what's the plan?

01:10:39.997 --> 01:10:41.180
F.R.E.D.I.?

01:10:41.182 --> 01:10:42.652
Preparing
to send radio message.

01:10:42.654 --> 01:10:44.987
Voice replication active.

01:10:44.989 --> 01:10:46.266
Brody?

01:10:46.268 --> 01:10:47.675
What's up?

01:10:47.677 --> 01:10:48.924
Those
kids just took off.

01:10:48.926 --> 01:10:50.843
They're running
north, go catch 'em.

01:10:50.845 --> 01:10:51.646
Come on, hustle!

01:10:53.213 --> 01:10:54.491
Nice job, F.R.E.D.I..

01:10:54.493 --> 01:10:55.099
Thanks, James.

01:10:55.101 --> 01:10:56.667
All right, let's go.

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:58.619
Our mission
may prove dangerous.

01:10:58.621 --> 01:11:00.509
First, safety precautions.

01:11:08.253 --> 01:11:09.054
Whoa.

01:11:13.694 --> 01:11:15.230
Emergency power down.

01:11:17.566 --> 01:11:18.939
Oh no, not again.

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:22.715
Okay, there's no
time for that, go now.

01:11:22.717 --> 01:11:25.438
This photo was taken
outside our facility today.

01:11:27.037 --> 01:11:30.235
Do you have any idea of
your son's whereabouts, sir?

01:11:30.237 --> 01:11:32.316
Or did he happen to
perhaps mention a Dr. Palmer?

01:11:32.318 --> 01:11:33.755
Hmm, no, couldn't tell ya.

01:11:33.757 --> 01:11:35.738
She's a highly
dangerous individual.

01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:37.116
Yeah, well, like I said, I
don't know anything about her

01:11:37.118 --> 01:11:38.909
and I'm sure James
doesn't either.

01:11:40.893 --> 01:11:43.707
We would really like to speak
with your son now, Mr. Nash.

01:11:43.709 --> 01:11:44.668
Well, let me
get this straight.

01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:46.620
You come in my shop on a
hunch and you wanna talk

01:11:46.622 --> 01:11:50.107
to my son who's a minor about
some missing war machine?

01:11:50.109 --> 01:11:50.718
Come on.

01:11:52.285 --> 01:11:54.268
Your lack of cooperation
could be considered treason.

01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:55.230
Don't threaten me.

01:11:56.189 --> 01:11:57.818
As far as I can tell the
only thing you can prove

01:11:57.820 --> 01:11:59.646
he's guilty of is
riding in a car.

01:12:00.414 --> 01:12:01.279
What's going on?

01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:03.708
Brody,
what are you doing?

01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:04.698
Did you spot them?

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:05.883
What do you mean?

01:12:05.885 --> 01:12:07.484
You said they took
off going north.

01:12:08.892 --> 01:12:10.619
Which way is north again?

01:12:10.621 --> 01:12:11.579
What, that wasn't me.

01:12:11.581 --> 01:12:12.636
I didn't say anything.

01:12:12.638 --> 01:12:13.438
Sir.

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:15.451
Not going anywhere.

01:12:15.453 --> 01:12:16.379
Get out of my way.

01:12:16.381 --> 01:12:17.435
I'm not moving.

01:12:17.437 --> 01:12:18.364
Get out of my way.

01:12:18.366 --> 01:12:19.323
Seriously?

01:12:19.325 --> 01:12:20.318
Get out.

01:12:29.757 --> 01:12:30.558
Let's go.

01:12:36.541 --> 01:12:38.683
What are you waiting for?

01:12:38.685 --> 01:12:39.486
Let's go.

01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:49.950
Really?

01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:54.523
Wait for me!

01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:01.627
Hey Brody, send me an update?

01:13:01.629 --> 01:13:03.739
Can't talk,
we're on bicycles.

01:13:03.741 --> 01:13:04.988
You're on bicycles?

01:13:04.990 --> 01:13:06.204
Why are you on bicycles?

01:13:06.206 --> 01:13:07.228
You know what, forget it,

01:13:07.230 --> 01:13:09.278
just the numbers are going
down, you got, hello?

01:13:26.174 --> 01:13:27.068
The probability of

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:29.563
us being captures is 78.6%.

01:13:29.565 --> 01:13:32.219
Danger, F.R.E.D.I.'s power
is rapidly depleting.

01:13:32.221 --> 01:13:34.234
Protection Protocol's offline.

01:13:34.236 --> 01:13:35.227
Nice timing.

01:13:35.229 --> 01:13:36.190
We need to split up.

01:13:52.382 --> 01:13:54.108
Time to end this.

01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:56.411
You, sir, step away.

01:13:56.413 --> 01:13:57.882
Homeland security.

01:13:57.884 --> 01:14:00.124
He's just a kid,
he's just a kid!

01:14:00.126 --> 01:14:01.948
What are you doing,
he's getting away.

01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:03.227
Move after him.

01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:04.890
Get out.

01:14:04.892 --> 01:14:05.691
- No.
- What?

01:14:05.693 --> 01:14:06.587
I'm out!

01:14:06.589 --> 01:14:07.707
I didn't sign up for this.

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:08.794
I quit.

01:14:08.796 --> 01:14:09.564
What do you mean, you quit?

01:14:09.566 --> 01:14:10.362
You can't quit.

01:14:10.364 --> 01:14:11.548
You crossed the line.

01:14:11.550 --> 01:14:13.214
You don't just
walk away from me.

01:14:14.269 --> 01:14:15.739
You're fired!

01:14:15.741 --> 01:14:18.139
You know what, I
can do this alone.

01:14:18.141 --> 01:14:19.482
You, what's your name?

01:14:19.484 --> 01:14:20.283
Brody, sir.

01:14:20.285 --> 01:14:21.914
Come on, Brody.

01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:23.037
Let's go get this kid.

01:14:24.892 --> 01:14:26.495
Get out of our way,
fat guy on a bike.

01:15:17.213 --> 01:15:18.014
Dr. Palmer?

01:15:18.973 --> 01:15:20.570
You made it.

01:15:20.572 --> 01:15:22.619
Quickly, we don't
have a lot of time.

01:15:22.621 --> 01:15:23.866
They're right behind us.

01:15:23.868 --> 01:15:25.435
I need somebody
to block the door.

01:15:25.437 --> 01:15:26.524
Just open the backpack.

01:15:26.526 --> 01:15:28.894
I got it, I got it, I got it.

01:15:33.245 --> 01:15:34.814
I'm gonna need
your assistance.

01:16:06.044 --> 01:16:07.645
Does that look right to you?

01:16:09.021 --> 01:16:11.485
I need you to double
check those numbers, okay?

01:16:24.733 --> 01:16:26.077
I think they're inside.

01:16:33.629 --> 01:16:34.526
Door is locked.

01:16:35.709 --> 01:16:37.851
All right, big man, I
want you to open her.

01:16:37.853 --> 01:16:38.747
Yes, sir.

01:16:38.749 --> 01:16:41.149
I'm going around the side.

01:16:52.926 --> 01:16:54.778
It's going down.

01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:55.773
It's going down.

01:17:01.532 --> 01:17:02.461
What are we gonna do?

01:17:04.412 --> 01:17:06.365
Follow the instructions
while I enter the code.

01:17:07.230 --> 01:17:08.410
Um, guys?

01:17:09.341 --> 01:17:10.941
I need another 30 seconds.

01:17:19.358 --> 01:17:20.570
It's at 2%.

01:17:20.572 --> 01:17:22.462
Do something, come on!

01:17:23.613 --> 01:17:24.251
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:27.485
We need to hurry.

01:17:29.693 --> 01:17:32.891
Palmer, we
know you're inside.

01:17:32.893 --> 01:17:34.234
He's coming!

01:17:34.236 --> 01:17:35.675
It's at 1%.

01:17:35.677 --> 01:17:37.051
We're almost there.

01:17:37.053 --> 01:17:41.854
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:44.539
Done!

01:17:44.541 --> 01:17:48.315
It stopped.

01:17:48.317 --> 01:17:49.531
It stopped.

01:17:49.533 --> 01:17:50.430
It stopped.

01:18:01.308 --> 01:18:02.557
You sure about this?

01:18:03.837 --> 01:18:04.638
I'm ready.

01:18:08.732 --> 01:18:09.501
Pull.

01:18:16.252 --> 01:18:17.466
Get over here!

01:18:17.468 --> 01:18:18.494
Give it back.

01:18:21.854 --> 01:18:23.163
It's not here.

01:18:23.165 --> 01:18:24.285
It's not here!

01:18:31.068 --> 01:18:35.869
How many times have I
told you that I never lose?

01:18:38.077 --> 01:18:39.517
Game's over, dark.

01:18:40.702 --> 01:18:41.626
I'll never give
F.R.E.D.I. to you.

01:18:41.628 --> 01:18:42.941
Oh, yes you will.

01:18:44.316 --> 01:18:45.278
Come on.

01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:46.941
Hand it over.

01:18:47.836 --> 01:18:49.147
Come on.

01:18:49.149 --> 01:18:50.714
We coulda been
somebody together,

01:18:50.716 --> 01:18:52.699
we coulda been a unit,
we coulda been a team.

01:18:52.701 --> 01:18:53.757
Just you and me.

01:18:54.749 --> 01:18:58.205
My beautiful little,
beautiful little creation.

01:18:59.581 --> 01:19:01.403
Initiating
self destruct sequence.

01:19:01.405 --> 01:19:03.066
Wait a minute.

01:19:03.068 --> 01:19:04.347
You.

01:19:04.349 --> 01:19:05.916
You didn't switch
this thing off?

01:19:05.918 --> 01:19:07.228
Here, we're all gonna die.

01:19:07.230 --> 01:19:09.018
No, we won't.

01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:11.901
Because some of us are programmed
for protection, not war.

01:19:20.764 --> 01:19:23.358
Goodbye, James.

01:19:40.701 --> 01:19:42.139
F.R.E.D.I.!

01:19:42.141 --> 01:19:43.389
Oh my gosh.

01:19:58.332 --> 01:19:59.675
You destroyed my baby!

01:19:59.677 --> 01:20:00.667
You and I both know
that F.R.E.D.I.'s

01:20:00.669 --> 01:20:02.075
core was compromised.

01:20:02.077 --> 01:20:03.674
This is nothing but
a failed experiment.

01:20:03.676 --> 01:20:05.083
You're a failed experiment.

01:20:05.085 --> 01:20:06.042
I'm gonna destroy you.

01:20:06.044 --> 01:20:07.130
Hey, boss?

01:20:07.132 --> 01:20:07.930
We gotta go.

01:20:07.932 --> 01:20:09.627
Shut up!

01:20:09.629 --> 01:20:10.654
Don't tell me what to do.

01:20:12.477 --> 01:20:13.243
Let's get going.

01:20:13.245 --> 01:20:14.046
I'm gonna destroy you.

01:20:23.677 --> 01:20:25.659
I thought you
just deactivated it.

01:20:25.661 --> 01:20:26.907
I'm sorry, James.

01:20:26.909 --> 01:20:28.219
It was too risky.

01:20:28.221 --> 01:20:29.083
Why would you do that?

01:20:29.085 --> 01:20:30.010
We had a deal.

01:20:30.012 --> 01:20:32.669
It was the only way, trust me.

01:20:41.181 --> 01:20:42.266
- She's gone, dad.
- It's okay.

01:20:42.268 --> 01:20:44.254
- She's gone.
- It's okay.

01:20:59.548 --> 01:21:01.181
- Hi, James.
- Hey.

01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:04.413
Natalie.

01:21:09.117 --> 01:21:09.979
AI.

01:21:09.981 --> 01:21:12.378
Where did you find an
interest in robots?

01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:14.682
It's a hobby I
picked up recently.

01:21:14.684 --> 01:21:15.834
He's obsessed.

01:21:15.836 --> 01:21:16.957
It's kind of cute actually.

01:21:18.493 --> 01:21:20.829
Well, Mr. Nash, I have
to say I'm quite impressed.

01:21:25.437 --> 01:21:26.266
Thank you.

01:21:58.045 --> 01:21:58.846
What?

01:22:10.877 --> 01:22:15.614
- Whoa!
- My man.

01:22:23.996 --> 01:22:25.210
Okay, I gotta go.

01:22:25.212 --> 01:22:26.715
I'll see you later tonight.

01:22:26.717 --> 01:22:29.597
All right, see
you later, Natalie.

01:22:40.668 --> 01:22:41.915
F.R.E.D.I.?

01:22:41.917 --> 01:22:43.931
Hello, James.

01:22:43.933 --> 01:22:44.956
But how?

01:22:44.958 --> 01:22:47.099
Dr. Palmer
held onto a prototype

01:22:47.101 --> 01:22:48.795
of my original design.

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:50.714
She downloaded my
memory at the chapel.

01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:51.866
What?

01:22:51.868 --> 01:22:53.081
This is crazy.

01:22:53.083 --> 01:22:55.930
I'm
functioning at 100%.

01:22:55.932 --> 01:22:56.733
That's amazing.

01:22:57.853 --> 01:22:59.643
Why wouldn't she
tell me or my dad?

01:22:59.645 --> 01:23:00.795
She thought
it was too dangerous

01:23:00.797 --> 01:23:02.458
to reveal my existence.

01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:04.410
So why are you here?

01:23:04.412 --> 01:23:07.194
Dr.
Palmer is in trouble.

01:23:07.196 --> 01:23:08.093
She needs our help.
