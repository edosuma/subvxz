[narrator] <i>Though many know</i>
<i>the tragic love story</i>

00:50.833 --> 00:52.541
<i>of Antony and Cleopatra,</i>

00:52.625 --> 00:54.625
<i>the wayward Roman general</i>

00:54.708 --> 00:57.833
<i>who fell madly in love</i>
<i>with the enchanting Egyptian queen,</i>

00:57.916 --> 00:59.916
<i>both of them taking their lives</i>

01:00.000 --> 01:03.083
<i>rather than face a world</i>
<i>without each other,</i>

01:03.166 --> 01:05.041
<i>few know the secret story</i>

01:05.125 --> 01:09.500
<i>of the most sought-after prize</i>
<i>and unsolved puzzle of their time.</i>

01:09.583 --> 01:12.625
<i>The mystery of Cleopatra's third egg.</i>

01:13.625 --> 01:17.541
<i>On their wedding day,</i>
<i>as a symbol of his undying devotion,</i>

01:17.625 --> 01:21.625
<i>Mark Antony presented Cleopatra</i>
<i>with three bejeweled eggs,</i>

01:21.708 --> 01:24.166
<i>each one more exquisite than the last.</i>

01:25.041 --> 01:29.750
<i>For centuries, these eggs were thought</i>
<i>to be nothing more than myth, rumor.</i>

01:29.833 --> 01:32.041
<i>But then, in 1907,</i>

01:32.125 --> 01:36.625
<i>just outside of Cairo,</i>
<i>a local farmer unearthed two of them.</i>

01:37.208 --> 01:39.833
<i>Some say the third egg was never found.</i>

01:39.916 --> 01:41.708
<i>Others claim it was discovered,</i>

01:41.791 --> 01:45.791
<i>but just as quickly lost,</i>
<i>never to be seen again.</i>

01:45.875 --> 01:49.166
<i>Join us as we explore that very question.</i>

01:49.250 --> 01:51.791
<i>What happened to Cleopatra's lost egg?</i>

01:51.875 --> 01:53.833
<i>Who may hold it in their possession?</i>

01:53.916 --> 01:56.916
<i>And most importantly,</i>
<i>will we ever see the day in which</i>

01:57.000 --> 02:02.208
<i>all three eggs are reunited</i>
<i>for the first time in over 2,000 years?</i>

02:02.291 --> 02:06.375
<i>Cleopatra's first egg</i>
<i>is on display for all to see</i>

02:06.458 --> 02:10.333
<i>at the world-famous Museo Nazionale</i>
<i>di Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome.</i>

02:10.416 --> 02:13.875
<i>The second egg has been</i>
<i>sold at auction numerous times</i>

02:13.958 --> 02:16.375

04:16.291 --> 04:17.375
You're not a cop.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.041
You're right, I'm not.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.500
You know what I mean, Agent.
Your badge is no good here.

04:21.583 --> 04:23.208
So no American cowboy stuff.

04:23.291 --> 04:25.083
Don't worry. Left my chaps at home.

04:25.625 --> 04:26.625
You sure about this?

04:27.250 --> 04:30.541
I know how he thinks.
He's gonna do it today. Trust me.

04:30.625 --> 04:32.041
All right, then, here we go.

04:32.125 --> 04:36.458
[woman speaking Italian]

04:37.791 --> 04:39.666
-[man in English] Impossible.
-I'm not asking.

04:39.750 --> 04:42.166
You need to shut the museum down,
evacuate your visitors,

04:42.250 --> 04:44.458
and seal all ingress
and egress points immediately.

04:44.541 --> 04:47.000
And Interpol has the authority
to compel me to do so?

04:47.083 --> 04:48.500
Don't test me, Director.

04:48.583 --> 04:49.625
You should listen to her.

04:49.708 --> 04:51.208
And who are you? Her bodyguard?

04:51.291 --> 04:54.791
This is Special Agent John Hartley
of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit.

04:54.875 --> 04:57.791
He's a consulting profiler
who specializes in art crime.

04:58.833 --> 05:00.166
You don't look like a profiler.

05:00.250 --> 05:01.958
Yeah, I get that a lot.

05:03.541 --> 05:06.541
Forty-one hours ago, Agent Hartley
received credible intelligence that

05:06.625 --> 05:10.000
the most wanted art thief in the world,
a man named Nolan Booth,

05:10.083 --> 05:12.583
intends to steal
the Egg of Cleopatra today.

05:13.916 --> 05:15.750
Who provided you this information?

05:15.833 --> 05:16.833
The Bishop.

05:16.916 --> 05:18.458
You cannot be serious.

05:18.958 --> 05:23.125
My dear, The Bishop is nothing more
than a boogeyman story in the art world.

05:23.208 --> 05:25.250
It's a catch-all concept.
It's someone to blame

05:25.333 --> 05:27.041
when you and your friends
in law enforcement

05:27.125 --> 05:29.541
are too incompetent to solve the case.

05:29.625 --> 05:33.208
Listen to me, unless we stop it,
that egg is gonna be stolen today.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.000
In fact, it may already be gone.

05:43.875 --> 05:45.333
[guard speaking Italian]

05:45.416 --> 05:47.416
[regal musical flourish]

05:52.041 --> 05:53.416
[in English] Already gone, you say?

05:54.583 --> 05:58.833
Now, if you'll excuse me, Inspector,
I believe I owe your supervisor a call.

06:01.875 --> 06:04.000
Do you have thermal sensors in this room?

06:06.291 --> 06:08.041
-Of course we do.
-Show it to me.

06:17.375 --> 06:18.833
[director] You're wasting our time.

06:18.916 --> 06:21.708
What, may I ask, are you looking for?

06:21.791 --> 06:25.333
Well, you see, Cleopatra's first egg
is covered in 18-karat gold.

06:25.416 --> 06:26.916
And gold reflects radiation.

06:27.666 --> 06:29.958
That egg should be
reflecting the heat in this room.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.833
It should be red, not blue.

06:33.083 --> 06:35.541
It's probably just an error
in the thermal sensor.

06:35.625 --> 06:37.500
Well, there's only one way to find out.

06:42.833 --> 06:46.583
Hey, sorry, big man, but there's
no food or drink in the museum.

06:49.666 --> 06:50.541
Thank you.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.083
No, no, wait a moment.
What do you think you're doing?

06:55.166 --> 06:58.083
[woman] Relax, it's fine.
He knows what he's doing.

[in English] Jesus,
you scared me. [chuckles]

10:24.666 --> 10:27.833
I know you. You're the… You're the slow
bald guy that's been chasing me.

10:27.916 --> 10:29.291
What do you got in the bag?

10:30.041 --> 10:32.125
You're American. What brings you to Rome?

10:33.500 --> 10:35.000
Gelato, the Colosseum.

10:35.083 --> 10:36.791
-Oh, it's beautiful. Beautiful place.
-Yeah.

10:36.875 --> 10:38.833
-First time?
-Yep.

10:38.916 --> 10:42.583
[Booth] That was a fun foot chase, right?
Lots of twists and turns. Hijinks.

10:42.666 --> 10:43.875
Who knew it'd end up like this?

10:43.958 --> 10:45.833
-I did.
-Right.

10:45.916 --> 10:48.750
Fun's over, Nolan Booth.
Give me the bag, turn around,

10:48.833 --> 10:50.833
put your hands behind your back.
You're under arrest.

10:50.916 --> 10:53.875
Okay. Well, hold on one sec.
I just have two questions.

10:53.958 --> 10:55.458
Okay. Um…

10:55.541 --> 10:58.125
First question,
where'd you get that jacket?

10:58.208 --> 10:59.458
It's a statement piece.

10:59.958 --> 11:02.916
Somewhere there is a very nude cow
whispering…

11:03.000 --> 11:03.958
[whispers] …"Worth it."

11:04.541 --> 11:07.541
And number two, on the whole
arresting me thing, I totally get it.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.208
You know, baby did a bad, bad thing. Yeah.

11:10.291 --> 11:13.250
But you don't happen to have,
like, a badge or somethin'

11:13.333 --> 11:15.791
tucked away in the turtleneck, do you?

11:16.416 --> 11:18.708
I don't need to show you my badge
because I've got a gun.

11:18.791 --> 11:20.750
Here's the thing.
You're putting me in a pickle.

11:20.833 --> 11:22.791
Without identification,
how do I know who you are?

11:22.875 --> 11:24.666
For all I know, you could be the bad guy,

11:24.750 --> 11:27.291
and I could be the other bad guy.

11:29.083 --> 11:30.875
You're right. I am the bad guy.

11:30.958 --> 11:33.750
Now shut up and give me the bag
before I shoot you in the mouth.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.083
-I'm gonna give this to you.
-[Hartley] Good.

11:36.583 --> 11:39.750
Yeah, I'm just gonna give it to you
'cause I don't even want it.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.750
For the record, none of this feels good.

11:41.833 --> 11:43.000

Special Agent John Hartley, FBI.
We met earlier.

14:58.833 --> 15:02.375
Aren't you a little outside
your jurisdiction?

15:03.250 --> 15:04.083
I am.

15:06.541 --> 15:07.791
Good thing these guys aren't.

[guns cocking]

15:12.750 --> 15:13.583
Wow!

15:15.750 --> 15:18.666
Hi, guys.
Don't take your shoes off or anything.

15:20.916 --> 15:22.208
You sure you brought enough guns?

15:22.291 --> 15:24.250
What can I say? I like to be thorough.

15:24.916 --> 15:27.041
[Booth] No way, José.

15:27.125 --> 15:30.791
-The intrepid Inspector Das.
-[scoffs]

15:30.875 --> 15:34.375
I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
I'll take that. Thank you.

15:34.458 --> 15:36.833
-It's nice to meet a fan.
-[Das] Oh, that's cute.

15:36.916 --> 15:38.583
You wanna know what else is cute?

15:38.666 --> 15:40.750
Because you're wanted
in 18 separate countries,

15:40.833 --> 15:43.083
I get to choose which one of them
detains you until trial,

15:43.166 --> 15:44.583
given your escape history.

15:44.666 --> 15:45.833
What are you, six for six now?

15:45.916 --> 15:48.000
Yeah. One more
and I get a Shawshank jacket.

15:48.083 --> 15:48.958
Keep making your jokes

15:49.041 --> 15:51.416
because I'm about to send you
to the worst place in the world.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.708
Your Instagram account?

15:52.791 --> 15:55.875
You know,
I'm really starting to not like you.

15:55.958 --> 15:57.166
Oh, come on!

15:57.250 --> 15:59.583
Not like me? You don't even know me.

16:00.291 --> 16:01.791
We could have a lot in common.

16:01.875 --> 16:05.625
[scoffs] Maybe I don't know you,
but I've been building a profile on you,

16:05.708 --> 16:08.625
ever since you stole William Strang's
<i>Lady with a Red Hat </i>from the Tate

16:08.708 --> 16:09.958
back in 2014.

16:10.041 --> 16:11.375
You can't prove that was me.

16:17.125 --> 16:18.416
I got that on Etsy.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.625
I've been tracking
your scores for a while.

16:22.708 --> 16:25.041
So let me take a crack
at who I think you really are.

16:25.875 --> 16:26.916
Sure thing. Yeah.

16:28.083 --> 16:29.333
-Only child.
-Mmm-hmm.

16:29.416 --> 16:32.375
[Hartley] Dad's a Swiss cop,
Mom's an American professor.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.708
You started stealing
between the ages of six and eight.

16:37.875 --> 16:39.791
You found out
you had a real talent for it.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.750
It made you feel special, different.

16:41.833 --> 16:44.583
You like to work alone.
You don't like a team.

16:44.666 --> 16:47.708
The only jobs you take are the ones
that make the big, splashy headlines,

16:47.791 --> 16:51.833
which tells me that you only do it
for the thrill and not the money.

16:51.916 --> 16:54.458
Are you insane? I love the money.

16:55.375 --> 16:58.750
I'm not done yet.
I'm just getting to the good part.

16:58.833 --> 17:00.208
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

17:00.291 --> 17:03.250
A lot of thieves out there
who claim to only do it for the money.

17:03.333 --> 17:04.625
That's not unusual.

17:05.208 --> 17:08.375
But what is unusual
is the risk that you take.

17:09.166 --> 17:10.250
The chances.

17:11.166 --> 17:15.916
It's as though you wanna get caught
so you can escape,

17:16.000 --> 17:17.791
just to prove yourself all over again,

17:17.875 --> 17:20.416
and prove that
you're better than everybody else

17:20.500 --> 17:22.833
and that you're worthy.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.583
Worthy of what? This speech?

17:24.666 --> 17:26.041
Your father's love.

17:36.416 --> 17:37.750
Congratulations.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.458
How'd you find me?

17:40.541 --> 17:43.708
Well, the same way I knew that
you were gonna steal the egg in Rome.

17:45.625 --> 17:46.916
[whispers] The Bishop.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.166
[whispers] The Bishop.

17:49.208 --> 17:50.875
[normally] Get him ready to move.

17:56.416 --> 17:58.791
[police radio chatter]

18:08.083 --> 18:09.041
Booth, I'm curious.

18:09.125 --> 18:12.791
How does it feel to be sold out
by the most wanted art thief in the world?

18:13.291 --> 18:15.500
I'm the most wanted art thief
in the world.

18:16.791 --> 18:17.708
You were.

18:18.916 --> 18:20.291
[Das] Wait. Wait here.

18:23.791 --> 18:26.500
There's no chance I'm putting
that thing in the same van as him.

18:29.833 --> 18:32.166
-See you at the airfield.
-I'll see you there.

18:33.375 --> 18:34.958
[suspenseful music playing]

18:44.333 --> 18:45.458
[car engines starting]

18:54.666 --> 18:56.833
[officer speaking Indonesian]
[alarm buzzing]

18:57.500 --> 18:58.833
[in English] Door open.

19:33.208 --> 19:34.500
[sighs]

19:34.583 --> 19:35.833
All right. We're good.

19:50.458 --> 19:52.375
-[upbeat music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

19:53.333 --> 19:54.625
Thank you.

20:01.208 --> 20:02.041
Hi, there.

20:06.458 --> 20:08.458
-You leaving town?
-[Hartley] Flight's in an hour.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.625
Something up?

20:10.250 --> 20:12.416
You could say that. Hmm.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.000
Okay. What's going on?

20:14.083 --> 20:16.375
[chuckles] Funny,
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

20:24.958 --> 20:26.083
What are you doing with that?

20:26.166 --> 20:32.125
Oh, this priceless piece
of ancient cultural whatnot?

20:32.625 --> 20:33.916
[gasps]

20:35.375 --> 20:37.583
[dramatic music playing]

20:38.208 --> 20:39.583
Oops!

20:39.666 --> 20:41.166
Booth gave us a fake egg.

20:41.250 --> 20:43.500
I'll admit,
Booth was my first thought too.

20:43.583 --> 20:45.750
Then I asked myself,
"How well do you really know someone

20:45.833 --> 20:47.708
you only met 72 hours ago?"

20:47.791 --> 20:49.458
And someone whose official credentials

20:49.541 --> 20:52.083
came solely by
a written interagency communiqué.

20:52.166 --> 20:57.875
So I called up the Assistant Director
of the BAU at Quantico, really nice lady.

20:57.958 --> 20:59.083
She'd never heard of you.

20:59.166 --> 21:00.708
-That's impossible.
-[Das] Is it?

21:00.791 --> 21:01.875
Yes, it's impossible.

21:01.958 --> 21:04.166
As impossible as a John Hartley
with a Swiss bank account

21:04.250 --> 21:06.458
that received an $8 million wire transfer

21:06.541 --> 21:09.500
from an encrypted third-party
on the same day the egg was stolen?

21:09.583 --> 21:12.875
Quite a coincidence,
wouldn't you say, Agent?

21:12.958 --> 21:14.791
[officer 1 shouting in Italian]

21:16.875 --> 21:18.958
[officer 2 over radio]
<i>We have eyes on target.</i>

21:19.041 --> 21:22.875
Listen, whatever you think this is,
whatever you think I did, I didn't do.

21:23.458 --> 21:26.333
Someone's behind this.
The Bishop, maybe even Booth himself.

21:26.416 --> 21:28.458
-I'm being set up.
-Maybe you are, maybe you're not.

21:28.541 --> 21:30.958
Until I figure it out,
I'm gonna keep you where I can find you.

21:31.041 --> 21:34.416
Now, normally,
I'm not a vindictive person, but,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.250
well, I trusted you
and you hurt my feelings.

21:37.833 --> 21:39.458
So I picked someplace extra special.

21:39.541 --> 21:42.500
It's a bit of a black site.
Kind of the land due process forgot.

21:43.083 --> 21:44.750
You're under arrest, Agent Hartley.

21:44.833 --> 21:47.083
Das, look at me. Look at my eyes.

21:50.666 --> 21:51.791
I didn't do this.

21:55.500 --> 21:56.708
I don't believe you.

21:57.208 --> 21:59.083
[ominous music playing]

22:31.750 --> 22:33.458
[inmates shouting indistinctly]

22:38.208 --> 22:40.083
[inmates laughing]

22:54.250 --> 22:57.291
You a top or a bottom? [grunts]

22:57.375 --> 23:00.500
Doesn't matter.
Prison's gonna decide for us.

23:00.583 --> 23:01.833
You gotta be shittin' me.

23:01.916 --> 23:04.583
[Booth] Well, I'll say one thing
about ol' Inspector Das,

23:04.666 --> 23:05.958
she's got a real sense of humor.

23:06.458 --> 23:07.833
Put 'er there, roomie.

23:09.791 --> 23:11.708
You're right, we should wash up first.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.708
It's okay. You're safe here.

23:15.541 --> 23:19.666
Except if they find out you're a cop.
Then they're gonna wanna kill you.

23:19.750 --> 23:21.041
[alarm buzzing]

23:23.333 --> 23:27.625
[indistinct chatter]

23:28.208 --> 23:31.125
[Booth] Bishop must have seen you
coming from a mile away.

23:31.208 --> 23:33.125
Got your trust after selling me out.

23:33.208 --> 23:36.541
Can't run a con without gaining
the mark's trust first, that's page one.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.500
I know how a confidence scheme works,
trust me.

23:39.583 --> 23:41.666
[Booth] Well, you do now, that's for sure.

23:41.750 --> 23:45.000
The same mystery thief who ratted me out
is the same one who framed you.

23:45.083 --> 23:46.958
That seems like a coincidence,
don't you think?

23:47.541 --> 23:50.083
This is not a coincidence. This is a plan.

23:50.708 --> 23:54.166
In one move, The Bishop took out
her lead competitor and lead investigator.

23:54.916 --> 23:56.541
-Two birds, one stone.
-Egg.

23:56.625 --> 23:59.041
-What?
-Two birds, one egg.

23:59.125 --> 24:01.625
It's kind of a lay-up.
Even Post Malone gets it.

24:02.291 --> 24:04.791
This is farm-to-table, right? Thank you.

24:04.875 --> 24:06.500
I don't understand why.

24:06.583 --> 24:09.750
Why would The Bishop go to the trouble of
framing me when she already has the egg?

24:11.000 --> 24:12.166
I mean, what's left?

24:12.666 --> 24:14.166
Three hundred million dollars?

24:14.791 --> 24:16.958
You're kidding.
I never heard of a price tag like that.

24:17.041 --> 24:17.958
No one has.

24:18.041 --> 24:21.000
But you don't understand,
that's not the price for just one egg.

24:21.583 --> 24:22.750
Here's the deal.

24:22.833 --> 24:26.375
Whoever brings
this Egyptian billionaire all three eggs

24:26.458 --> 24:30.583
by the night of his daughter's wedding
gets all the marbles.

24:30.666 --> 24:33.958
Turns out,
Mr. Big Daddy Big Bucks' daughter,

24:34.041 --> 24:35.166
guess what her name is?

24:35.250 --> 24:36.666
Stop guessing, it's Cleopatra.

24:37.333 --> 24:41.458
I mean, these people are horrible.
But I like money, so…

24:42.041 --> 24:43.208
So how does that work?

24:43.791 --> 24:46.458
No one knows where the third egg is.
It's never been found.

24:46.541 --> 24:49.833
I'm not gonna lie,
that's a bit of a problem.

24:49.916 --> 24:51.958
I was gonna deal with
the second egg first.

24:52.041 --> 24:53.333
Then the rest.

24:53.416 --> 24:56.666
[sighs] All right, well,
Bureau intel says that the second egg

24:56.750 --> 24:58.458
is owned by an international arms dealer.

24:58.541 --> 25:00.250
Sotto Voce. I know all about this guy.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.666
His dad tried to strangle him
when he was 14.

25:02.750 --> 25:05.041
Nobody can stand
this son of a bitch. [chuckles]

25:06.083 --> 25:08.125
<i>Apparently, it left</i>
<i>quite the impression on him.</i>

25:08.208 --> 25:11.500
<i>And strangling folks</i>
<i>became sort of a hobby for him.</i>

25:12.208 --> 25:13.291
<i>He's a big fan.</i>

25:13.375 --> 25:14.625
[man choking]

25:14.708 --> 25:17.041
[Booth] <i>Sotto Voce is super scary.</i>

25:17.125 --> 25:18.666
<i>But he's not above having a good time.</i>

25:19.250 --> 25:22.000
<i>Throws a masquerade party every year</i>
<i>for his top buyers</i>

25:22.083 --> 25:25.208
<i>in his I-probably-have-a-tiny-penis villa</i>
<i>in Valencia.</i>

25:25.291 --> 25:27.500
<i>Gunrunners are a little touchy</i>
<i>about their identity.</i>

25:27.583 --> 25:30.958
<i>So the </i>Eyes Wide Shut <i>thing</i>
<i>takes the edge off for everyone.</i>

25:31.041 --> 25:34.000
<i>Now, what none of these</i>
<i>evil one-percenters know</i>

25:34.083 --> 25:36.583
<i>is that upstairs,</i>
<i>locked away in a secret vault,</i>

25:36.666 --> 25:39.458
<i>Dr. Shirtless has in his possession</i>

25:39.541 --> 25:42.375
<i>an ancient piece of pricelessness</i>
<i>that I like to call…</i>

25:43.583 --> 25:45.541
<i>Cleopatra's second egg.</i>

25:47.250 --> 25:49.875
And it's just begging for me to steal it.

25:49.958 --> 25:52.708
I'd be on my way there right now
if you weren't such a super cop.

25:54.750 --> 25:56.000
-Don't do that.
-[whispers] What?

25:56.083 --> 25:57.708
-Don't do that.
-[whispers] Do what?

25:57.791 --> 26:01.416
-I know what you're doing. Listen.
-[whispers] I'm not doing anything.

26:01.500 --> 26:04.750
[whispering] These guys here,
if they find out you're a C-O-P…

26:04.833 --> 26:08.250
This is a room full of convicted murderers
and toilet vodka enthusiasts.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.416
We gotta make sure
they know you're not a cop.

26:10.500 --> 26:13.791
-[yelling] <i>Nyet politsiya.</i>
-[in English] Listen to me. I beg…

26:14.500 --> 26:17.958
Guys? <i>Nyet politsiya. </i>Not a cop.

26:18.041 --> 26:21.458
This man is not a cop, all right?

26:21.541 --> 26:23.625
Get that through
your thick skulls right now!

26:23.708 --> 26:26.375
He's a profiler for the FBI,

26:26.458 --> 26:30.416
which does fall under the umbrella
of law enforcement, but not a cop.

26:30.500 --> 26:33.916
It's similar, but it's not the same thing.
It's a complicated backstory.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.666
This is our good friend,
Special Agent John Hartley.

26:36.750 --> 26:39.208
Let's give him a warm welcome
to the prison, guys.

26:39.875 --> 26:40.916
[prisoner 1 clears throat]

26:42.500 --> 26:43.916
[prisoner 2 coughs]

26:44.875 --> 26:48.000
Thank you, guys. [whispering]
I don't think anyone heard me. We're good.

26:48.083 --> 26:49.833
All's quiet on the western front.

26:49.916 --> 26:52.166
-Nobody's… Oh, no.
-[objects clattering]

26:52.250 --> 26:55.375
[Booth] Yep.
Drago Grande heard. Here he comes.

26:57.333 --> 26:59.291
[whispering] Okay, be cool.
Don't embarrass me.

27:02.625 --> 27:03.958
[normally] Hello, sir.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.500
<i>Politsiya.</i>

27:08.291 --> 27:09.375
You die.

27:09.458 --> 27:11.125
[whispering] Okay, he knows.

27:11.833 --> 27:13.125
He knows you're a cop.

27:13.708 --> 27:14.791
The jig is up.

27:22.958 --> 27:24.916
[all exclaiming]

27:25.000 --> 27:26.083
[whispering] It's okay.

27:27.291 --> 27:28.375
You can…

27:28.875 --> 27:31.458
You can have mine.
You need some nourishment.

27:33.791 --> 27:36.833
[all exclaiming]

27:36.916 --> 27:40.000
[whispering] You should get up.
You look like a little bitch right now.

27:40.083 --> 27:41.416
I say that as a friend.

27:44.333 --> 27:45.416
[Hartley sighs]

27:46.041 --> 27:46.958
Okay, look.

27:47.625 --> 27:50.083
I don't wanna do
the whole prison fight thing with you…

27:50.166 --> 27:54.375
-[soft] You got this. I'm in your corner.
-So please, no fight.

27:54.458 --> 27:56.750
Let's just go back and finish our meals.

27:57.250 --> 27:58.583
[both grunting]

27:59.166 --> 28:01.125
[grunts, groans]

28:01.208 --> 28:03.208
[all cheering]

28:11.416 --> 28:13.708
-No. No--
-[guard in Russian] Back to your cell!

28:14.750 --> 28:15.958
[Booth in English] God…

28:17.000 --> 28:18.458
All that working out.

28:19.041 --> 28:21.750
You still get your ass spanked
by a toothless man with tuberculosis--

28:21.833 --> 28:23.958
Okay. Okay.

28:24.041 --> 28:27.083
If you ever pull shit like that again,
it'll be the last thing you do.

28:27.166 --> 28:28.250
Right.

28:28.333 --> 28:30.625
-You don't know me, Booth.
-No.

28:30.708 --> 28:32.291
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

28:32.375 --> 28:34.416
Okay. Thank God, you're here.

28:35.791 --> 28:37.750
[in Russian] The captain wants to see you.

28:37.833 --> 28:38.666
Let's go!

28:38.750 --> 28:39.875
[in English] Him?

28:39.958 --> 28:41.583
Oh, no, us. Okay.

28:49.541 --> 28:50.666
[Booth sighs]

28:53.583 --> 28:54.708
Hello, boys.

28:55.458 --> 28:56.625
Oh, my God.

28:56.708 --> 28:57.791
Wow.

28:58.791 --> 29:00.250
You're the captain?

29:00.333 --> 29:03.250
You might benefit
from a little career change. [chuckles]

29:03.333 --> 29:05.208
I mean, I'm… I don't think runway,

29:05.291 --> 29:08.250
but definitely
regional catalog work, fliers…

29:08.333 --> 29:09.333
She's The Bishop.

29:09.416 --> 29:11.958
No shit, dipdick!

29:12.041 --> 29:15.208
It's so nice to finally meet you,
Mr. Booth.

29:15.291 --> 29:17.916
Such a thrill to be face-to-face

29:18.000 --> 29:20.416
with the second-best art thief
in the world.

29:20.500 --> 29:24.875
Oh, I see what you did there.
That's… [chuckles]

29:24.958 --> 29:28.083
Yeah, you got lucky
a couple of times early on, you know?

29:28.166 --> 29:31.250
But you can't name one time
in the past year that you beat me.

29:31.333 --> 29:33.041
-Helsinki.
-My parachute failed.

29:33.125 --> 29:34.041
Jakarta.

29:34.125 --> 29:36.166
-My Segway sank.
-Macau.

29:36.250 --> 29:38.208
Nobody knew that Miley Cyrus
was going to be there.

29:38.291 --> 29:39.916
It was a completely unannounced show.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.875
You can have excuses or results.

29:42.958 --> 29:44.625
-[whispers] Not both.
-[scoffs]

29:44.708 --> 29:46.791
What are we doing here? What do you want?

29:46.875 --> 29:48.750
To have a chat.

29:48.833 --> 29:50.166
First of all, Agent Hartley,

29:50.291 --> 29:54.041
please accept my sincerest apologies
for the whole mix-up in Rome.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.666
<i>You see, after I stole the egg in Bali,</i>

29:56.750 --> 30:01.958
<i>I then made an $8 million deposit</i>
<i>into an account registered in your name.</i>

30:02.625 --> 30:06.916
<i>Then, all I had to do was sit back</i>
<i>and wait for Das to take the bait.</i>

30:07.000 --> 30:08.666
[cell phone ringing]

30:08.750 --> 30:12.541
<i>A few clever keystrokes</i>
<i>and a well-timed call intercept.</i>

30:12.625 --> 30:14.791
[The Bishop] <i>FBI BAU Director's office.</i>

30:14.875 --> 30:16.958
And poof. [gasps]

30:17.041 --> 30:19.333
[mockingly] Bye-bye, Agent John Hartley.

30:20.750 --> 30:22.583
Hello, suspicious suspect.

30:22.666 --> 30:24.333
Funny, don't you think?

30:24.416 --> 30:26.125
[laughing]

30:26.208 --> 30:28.083
Shut up. You deleted my life.

30:28.166 --> 30:30.208
And now I'm stuck in a cell
with this idiot.

30:31.291 --> 30:34.041
Well, down to business then.

30:34.125 --> 30:36.750
At the risk of stating the obvious,

30:37.333 --> 30:39.375
I have the first egg in my possession,

30:39.458 --> 30:43.666
and in less than 48 hours,
I'm gonna have the second one as well.

30:45.041 --> 30:49.416
But that leaves an issue. The final egg.

30:49.500 --> 30:52.000
Well, too bad for you.
Nobody knows where the third egg is.

30:52.791 --> 30:54.166
He didn't tell you?

30:54.791 --> 30:56.125
You didn't tell him?

30:56.791 --> 30:59.000
-Didn't tell me what?
-I don't know what she's talking about.

30:59.083 --> 31:01.458
Your cellmate here
knows exactly where the third egg is.

31:01.541 --> 31:04.833
She's lying. I do not know
where the third egg is. I swear to God.

31:05.875 --> 31:08.208
[Booth] <i>I know where the third egg is.</i>
<i>I swear to God.</i>

31:08.750 --> 31:12.291
Yes, that is me. Scratch that.
That was me. I did say that.

31:12.375 --> 31:14.625
When were you gonna tell me
about the third egg?

31:14.708 --> 31:18.000
I was never gonna tell you
about the third egg because you're a cop.

31:18.083 --> 31:20.458
[The Bishop]
My offer to you, Mr. Booth, is this.

31:20.541 --> 31:24.750
Tell me where the third egg is,
I'll get you out of here and give you 10%.

31:24.833 --> 31:26.041
Rock-hard pass.

31:26.125 --> 31:28.125
I'm sorry we couldn't do business.

31:28.916 --> 31:31.166
Well, perhaps a few more days in here

31:31.250 --> 31:35.125
with the prospect
of thousands more to come

31:36.041 --> 31:37.875
will help change your mind. [chuckles]

31:38.833 --> 31:40.916
I'll stop by once I have the second egg.

31:41.416 --> 31:44.625
Oh, and when I do,
the offer's gonna be 5%.

31:44.708 --> 31:48.291
[in Russian] Thank you, Captain.
Labor detail for them both.

31:49.833 --> 31:52.625
[in English] Bye. Don't miss me too much.

31:52.708 --> 31:53.916
Ta-ta!

31:56.416 --> 31:58.083
Oh, hey, guys. [chuckles] Okay!

31:59.125 --> 32:00.958
[Hartley]
If we work together to catch her,

32:01.041 --> 32:03.333
I can do things
to The Bishop you can't do.

32:03.416 --> 32:05.000
[Booth]
There's no need to be disgusting.

32:05.083 --> 32:07.541
[both grunting]

32:08.500 --> 32:11.916
Here we go. Three, two, one.
Lift with your neck.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.250
I mean put her in prison. For life.

32:15.125 --> 32:18.625
When that happens, guess who becomes
number one art thief in the world again?

32:20.666 --> 32:23.708
Teamwork? It feels weird in my mouth.

32:23.791 --> 32:24.875
Are you carrying your side?

32:24.958 --> 32:27.833
-I'm offended you'd even ask me that.
-[grunting]

32:27.916 --> 32:30.750
-Do something. It's slipping.
-Oh, relax, baldylocks.

32:31.375 --> 32:32.500
[grunts]

32:35.875 --> 32:38.041
See? Teamwork.

32:39.250 --> 32:43.208
Team. Team. Team.
[chuckling] It feels weird in my mouth.

32:43.291 --> 32:44.125
It does.

32:44.833 --> 32:49.083
Say what you will about Russian prisons,
the soap is incredible.

32:49.166 --> 32:51.875
-Are we doing this together or not?
-No added chemicals or perfumes.

32:51.958 --> 32:54.500
It's just pure
good ol' fashioned glycerin.

32:55.416 --> 32:58.083
-Ooh. Smell it.
-I'm not gonna smell it.

32:58.166 --> 33:00.791
Sotto Voce's masquerade ball
is tomorrow night,

33:00.875 --> 33:03.250
which means, if we're gonna beat
The Bishop to the second egg,

33:03.333 --> 33:06.291
we have to be on the other side
of these walls by tomorrow morning.

33:06.375 --> 33:07.875
I already know how I'm gonna steal it.

33:07.958 --> 33:10.791
It'll take adjustment now The Bishop'll
be there, but I'll beat her to the punch.

33:10.875 --> 33:13.083
"I"? What about "we"?

33:13.166 --> 33:16.041
Why are you wearing the hairnet?
You're bald.

33:19.250 --> 33:22.625
Okay, fine. You can be my plus-one
to Sotto Voce's party.

33:23.333 --> 33:27.583
[Hartley] Thanks. Clock's tickin'.
We gotta get outta here. What's the plan?

33:28.125 --> 33:29.250
[Booth] I'm working on it.

33:30.875 --> 33:33.166
You're working on it?
You sound like you're working on it.

33:33.250 --> 33:36.583
They say the most important part
of any plan is a good night's sleep.

33:37.333 --> 33:40.666
Isn't the actual plan part
the most important part of the plan?

33:40.750 --> 33:42.541
A lotta people make that mistake.

33:48.708 --> 33:50.583
Back in Bali, that thing you said,

33:52.041 --> 33:53.916
about me and my father, how'd you know?

33:55.750 --> 33:58.625
I hate to break it to you,
but you're not a complex case.

33:59.166 --> 34:01.208
The one thing
that doesn't quite line up for me is

34:01.291 --> 34:04.958
how the son of a Swiss police captain
turns to a life of high crime.

34:05.041 --> 34:06.083
Short version?

34:07.875 --> 34:11.833
My father was a prolific asshole.

34:12.791 --> 34:13.875
Long version?

34:15.333 --> 34:17.125
When I was eight years old,

34:18.916 --> 34:21.083
my dad thought I stole his watch.

34:21.666 --> 34:24.125
He loved that piece of metal
more than anything.

34:26.041 --> 34:29.000
He asked me if I stole it.
I told him I didn't.

34:29.791 --> 34:32.625
He said he knew that I had
and that I was lying.

34:33.291 --> 34:35.708
He didn't speak to me again after that.

34:35.791 --> 34:38.541
Not on Christmas. Not on my birthday.

34:40.750 --> 34:45.291
He went almost a full year,
just utter silence.

34:46.500 --> 34:47.916
Like I didn't even exist.

34:50.583 --> 34:52.000
Then one night, he…

34:53.458 --> 34:56.750
He comes home
and he sits down at the dinner table…

34:58.625 --> 34:59.958
And there it is.

35:00.041 --> 35:02.250
There's the watch, the missing watch,

35:02.958 --> 35:04.541
right there on his wrist.

35:04.625 --> 35:07.416
Found out later that he put it
in his desk at work

35:07.500 --> 35:10.208
and it got buried behind some papers
or something like that.

35:10.291 --> 35:12.500
But he never apologized. He just, uh…

35:13.500 --> 35:16.333
He just looked me in the eye
and said, "How was your day at school?"

35:18.958 --> 35:21.833
Then he kept askin',
"How was your day at school?"

35:21.916 --> 35:23.458
And I never answered him.

35:24.958 --> 35:27.458
I just stared at him.
I didn't eat. I didn't drink.

35:28.750 --> 35:31.083
Next week,
I found myself in boarding school.

35:34.458 --> 35:35.833
[snoring]

35:35.916 --> 35:36.916
Really?

35:37.000 --> 35:39.041
[laughing]

35:39.125 --> 35:41.083
[inhales] I'm kidding.

35:42.500 --> 35:43.375
Hey.

35:44.916 --> 35:46.083
I'm sorry about all that.

35:47.375 --> 35:49.958
Oh, no, no, no, no,
it's all right. [sniffs]

35:50.041 --> 35:51.750
You learn a valuable lesson, you know?

35:52.625 --> 35:54.166
It doesn't matter what you do,

35:56.125 --> 35:58.125
only matters what they think you've done.

36:00.083 --> 36:01.041
How about your old man?

36:02.708 --> 36:03.875
I don't talk about him.

36:03.958 --> 36:05.083
[Booth chuckles]

36:07.125 --> 36:08.125
That bad, huh?

36:09.416 --> 36:11.375
[suspenseful music playing]

36:22.333 --> 36:23.416
[Booth] Good news.

36:23.500 --> 36:26.541
I slept like a baby after
our little therapy session last night.

36:27.041 --> 36:27.875
Better news,

36:28.375 --> 36:31.375
I've got our escape plan
down to a simple three-step process.

36:31.916 --> 36:33.750
All right, I'll bite.
What's the first step?

36:33.833 --> 36:36.208
-[whistles] Create a distraction.
-With soap?

36:36.875 --> 36:39.416
You know what happens
when you mix soap, which is pure glycerin,

36:39.500 --> 36:42.291
with a cleaning solution
that's essentially nitric acid?

36:42.375 --> 36:44.416
-You get nitroglycerin.
-You get nitroglycerin.

36:44.500 --> 36:45.375
We should run.

36:45.458 --> 36:47.375
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

36:47.458 --> 36:49.500
[machine whirring rapidly]

36:50.208 --> 36:51.541
[man grunts]

36:51.625 --> 36:54.166
[guards shouting in Russian]

36:54.250 --> 36:55.833
[all grunting]

36:56.875 --> 36:58.000
[screams]

36:59.208 --> 37:01.000
-[guard 1 grunts]
-[guard 2 speaks Russian]

37:02.208 --> 37:03.666
[grunting continues]

37:09.416 --> 37:10.375
[all straining]

37:11.583 --> 37:12.541
[all grunting]

37:24.625 --> 37:27.583
[inmates clamoring]

37:30.541 --> 37:32.291
[in English]
It's locked. We need a key card.

37:32.375 --> 37:33.541
Step two, plan ahead.

37:33.625 --> 37:35.791
-Where'd you get that?
<i>-Nyet politsiya.</i>

37:36.291 --> 37:37.208
He's not a cop!

37:37.291 --> 37:38.416
[grunts]

37:49.000 --> 37:50.625
[phone rings]

37:53.458 --> 37:54.916
What's the plan-- Son of a bitch!

37:56.416 --> 37:59.041
-[in Russian] What? Understood.
-[indistinct chatter on phone]

38:03.625 --> 38:05.583
[in English] What are you doing?
What's step three?

38:05.666 --> 38:06.791
[shushes]

38:13.125 --> 38:14.166
[Booth] Step three…

38:16.166 --> 38:17.208
Rock Jenga.

38:29.708 --> 38:30.833
You first.

38:31.416 --> 38:33.958
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

38:34.041 --> 38:35.250
[in Russian] Get back!

38:35.333 --> 38:36.458
[gun cocking]

38:43.500 --> 38:44.458
This way.

38:52.166 --> 38:55.625
They're outside the walls.
Secure the perimeter.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.291
[guards exclaiming in Russian]

39:10.583 --> 39:11.416
[Hartley grunting]

39:12.958 --> 39:15.416
[Booth exclaiming]

39:15.500 --> 39:16.750
[breathing heavily]

39:16.833 --> 39:18.291
[in English] Thank you. [panting]

39:18.375 --> 39:21.541
[breathing heavily]

39:22.166 --> 39:24.375
Okay. Okay.

39:39.833 --> 39:41.625
Can you fly a helicopter?

39:41.708 --> 39:44.083
Does the back of your head
look like a huge penis?

39:46.208 --> 39:47.791
The answer is yes!

39:48.291 --> 39:50.291
[Russian pop music playing]

39:55.916 --> 39:58.166
Oh, that's fun. This is my best friend.

39:58.875 --> 40:00.291
[guard grunts]

40:01.000 --> 40:03.083
-We're not friends.
-We're best friends.

40:03.833 --> 40:05.750
-[in Russian] They're over here!
-[in English] Go!

40:20.458 --> 40:21.625
[grunts]

40:25.208 --> 40:26.875
I can't believe nobody saw that.

40:27.833 --> 40:28.875

40:28.958 --> 40:30.333
[in Russian] Here they are! Fire!

40:32.375 --> 40:33.500
[guards continue shouting]

40:41.000 --> 40:42.041
[Booth in English] Okay.

40:42.125 --> 40:43.000
Oh.

40:43.083 --> 40:44.125
That's in Russian.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
[guards speaking indistinctly]

40:54.000 --> 40:55.125
[guards shout]

40:58.500 --> 41:00.625
[in Russian] Go, he just has a pistol!

41:03.791 --> 41:05.250
[guards speaking indistinctly]

41:08.500 --> 41:09.375
[guard] The forklift!

41:35.708 --> 41:36.541
Huh.

Uh-oh.

42:13.750 --> 42:15.041
[guards yelling]

42:30.750 --> 42:32.083
[in English] Son of a bitch.

42:36.375 --> 42:37.250
[in Russian] Reload!

42:39.500 --> 42:40.708
[in English] Shit.

42:48.291 --> 42:49.250
[grunts]

42:51.500 --> 42:53.250
Oh, you made it. Thank God!

42:53.333 --> 42:54.666
[grunting]

42:54.750 --> 42:55.791
I was praying for you.

42:55.875 --> 42:57.958
Don't give me that shit.
You were gonna leave me?

42:59.125 --> 43:00.375
You said, "Save yourself."

43:00.458 --> 43:02.250
I said, "Go,"
but I didn't mean without me.

43:02.333 --> 43:04.416
You said, "Go save yourself."

43:04.500 --> 43:07.500
And I was gonna carry you with me
in my heart like an eternal flame,

43:07.583 --> 43:08.791
you stupid complainer.

43:08.875 --> 43:09.750
[alarm beeping]

43:09.833 --> 43:11.291
[Booth] Why is that blinking?

43:15.500 --> 43:17.791

43:41.416 --> 43:43.583
[Hartley panting]

43:43.666 --> 43:45.708
See? Easy-peasy.

43:52.958 --> 43:55.583
[The Bishop] I know it sounds
like a tough childhood,

43:55.666 --> 43:57.916
but my father made me who I am today.

43:59.916 --> 44:01.541
Maybe that's my problem.

44:02.666 --> 44:07.250
I'm so focused on winning all the time,
on being the best at what I do,

44:07.333 --> 44:11.458
that I can never
just fully relax and just be.

44:13.625 --> 44:14.791
Is that normal?

44:15.458 --> 44:16.958
[muffled] How the fuck would I know?

44:22.916 --> 44:24.083
[The Bishop] What?

44:24.166 --> 44:26.958
I'm not a therapist.
I'm an intelligence analyst.

44:27.041 --> 44:28.000
I'm sorry.

44:29.458 --> 44:31.666
[sighs] I'm just dealing
with a lot right now

44:31.750 --> 44:33.833
and you seemed like
someone I could talk to.

44:34.333 --> 44:36.041
And it's so rare in my line of work

44:36.125 --> 44:38.333
to find someone
who's just there to listen.

44:38.958 --> 44:39.791
Thank you.

44:40.666 --> 44:44.333
Anyway, I'm sorry
to rope you into all of this,

44:44.416 --> 44:46.166
but just using your terminal here

44:46.250 --> 44:49.625
to ensure that the origin point
of my message is untraceable.

44:49.708 --> 44:52.333
Best way to do it is
from within the system itself.

44:52.416 --> 44:55.791
They should really work on
patching the security vulnerability.

44:55.875 --> 44:56.916
It's embarrassing.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.875
Did you know that 99%
of all tracking protocols

44:59.958 --> 45:02.041
focus on third-party movements? [scoffs]

45:03.666 --> 45:07.291
No one ever expects the call
to come from inside the house, as it were.

45:08.000 --> 45:12.083
Hence, your computer, your office.

45:12.166 --> 45:13.916
Oh. Here we go.

45:14.625 --> 45:18.166
Just need to slow down my competition,
such as they are.

45:41.916 --> 45:44.375
I'm afraid that's
all the time we have for today.

45:44.875 --> 45:49.125
I'm gonna have to end our session here.
Have a lovely day.

45:49.208 --> 45:50.166

45:58.708 --> 45:59.833
[sighs] See?

46:01.166 --> 46:03.291
This is why we can't have nice things.

46:03.375 --> 46:07.125
'Cause the moment I trust someone,
they tap the foot alarm beneath their desk

46:07.208 --> 46:09.250
and then I'm forced
to do things like this.

46:10.166 --> 46:13.041
I'm not angry. I'm just disappointed.

46:13.125 --> 46:15.500
I really thought you were different.

46:16.416 --> 46:18.666
Well, fool me once…

46:20.958 --> 46:22.625
I'm gonna leave now and when he wakes up,

46:22.708 --> 46:25.333
you're going to tell him
that you triggered the alarm falsely

46:25.416 --> 46:28.041
and in his haste,
he tripped coming through the door.

46:28.875 --> 46:30.708
And if you decide not to do that,

46:31.333 --> 46:34.708
I want you to remember
one critically important thing.

46:35.416 --> 46:39.625
I know everyone you work with
and every member of your family.

46:40.500 --> 46:43.208
And I also know your browser history.

47:03.416 --> 47:05.666
Tambwe! Come on, bring it in.

47:06.458 --> 47:07.416
[Tambwe] Oh.

47:08.666 --> 47:10.416
I can't thank you enough for this.

47:10.500 --> 47:12.625
I'm just glad
I could finally repay my debt to you.

47:12.708 --> 47:13.833
And now I'm in yours.

47:13.916 --> 47:15.291
[Tambwe laughs]

47:15.375 --> 47:16.666
-Come, everything is ready.
-Alright.

47:16.750 --> 47:18.250
-I have juice boxes.
-That's very good.

47:18.333 --> 47:21.708
Hey. Tambwe got us a costume change,
so we can get out of these filthy duds.

47:21.791 --> 47:22.875
Oh. I'm so sorry.

47:22.958 --> 47:26.000
Tambwe, this is Agent John Hartley

47:26.083 --> 47:29.291
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
It's a funny story.

47:29.375 --> 47:32.166
A lot of his colleagues have
put a lot of your colleagues in prison.

47:32.250 --> 47:33.250
It's exciting.

47:34.958 --> 47:36.125
No juice boxes for you.

47:57.750 --> 47:58.750
[exhales]

47:59.583 --> 48:00.750
Oh, I see.

48:00.833 --> 48:03.458
Nice jacket, while I "Gotta dance."

48:03.541 --> 48:06.083
All right, man.
Don't even start with me, okay?

48:06.166 --> 48:07.875
At least you're comfortable.

48:10.625 --> 48:12.958
Well, clearly you have
this whole thing figured out.

48:13.041 --> 48:16.041
-You wanna walk me through it?
-I do. Here's the deal.

48:16.125 --> 48:17.208
<i>During the party,</i>

48:17.291 --> 48:20.208

48:24.625 --> 48:27.083

Hidden entrance.

48:27.166 --> 48:28.375

48:28.458 --> 48:31.000
<i>We dress up in matching black pajamas</i>

48:31.083 --> 48:34.000
<i>and sneak past the featured extras</i>
<i>and into the bedroom.</i>

48:35.458 --> 48:39.625
<i>Then, we slip through the study</i>
<i>and get our hands on his precious.</i>

48:39.708 --> 48:42.708
-Is that the egg?
-[shushes]

48:42.791 --> 48:43.750
I'm sorry.

48:49.791 --> 48:51.333
-You are amazing.
-I know.

48:52.791 --> 48:53.625
Wow.

48:54.875 --> 48:56.291
-Hey, dickhead.
-Hmm?

48:56.375 --> 48:58.583
Your last brilliant plan
had some kinks in it.

48:58.666 --> 48:59.583
Mmm-hmm.

48:59.666 --> 49:01.916
So, what kinda security surveillance
are we looking at?

49:02.000 --> 49:03.291
Well, the guy's an arms dealer,

49:03.375 --> 49:06.416
so, you know, every square inch
of this place is gonna be on lock.

49:06.500 --> 49:10.416

49:14.541 --> 49:15.875
<i>It's a pretty tight window.</i>

49:16.916 --> 49:19.750

49:42.750 --> 49:45.583
<i>The only way through it</i>
<i>is with facial and voice recognition.</i>

49:45.666 --> 49:48.541
<i>And there's only one face</i>
<i>and one voice that opens it.</i>

49:49.041 --> 49:50.541
Sotto Voce.

49:50.625 --> 49:52.958
How are we gonna get
his voice and his facial?

49:53.041 --> 49:55.625
Well, first off,
a positive mental attitude helps.

49:56.125 --> 50:00.291
But so does some pretty kick-ass
deepfake technology.

50:02.166 --> 50:03.750
Spooky, right?

50:03.833 --> 50:05.958
If you have
more than 12 images on the Internet,

50:06.541 --> 50:09.958
I can send your mom
a video of you mouth-sexing a goat.

50:10.041 --> 50:13.416
I'm not saying I'm gonna do that,
I'm just saying I could if I wanted to.

50:13.500 --> 50:15.666
If I had enough time and enough pictures.

50:15.750 --> 50:16.791
[shutter clicking]

50:17.916 --> 50:20.000
But wait, there's more.

50:27.041 --> 50:29.958
<i>and Sotto Voce's phone can only be found</i>
<i>in Sotto Voce's pants.</i>

50:30.583 --> 50:32.875
So, yeah, easy-peasy.

50:33.458 --> 50:35.625
Oh, no, no, no! There's one more thing.
Kinda important.

50:35.708 --> 50:40.875
We're gonna need his thumbprint 'cause
he never upgraded his iPhone -4, so…

50:40.958 --> 50:43.416
So if we don't get his thumbprint,
we can't get the egg.

50:43.500 --> 50:45.083
Oh, my God.

50:46.291 --> 50:48.875
You can learn. This is amazing.

50:48.958 --> 50:50.166
You are not sparkly enough.

50:50.250 --> 50:52.416
I'm gonna get you a matching vest
to go with those pants.

What's your 20, free bird?

51:40.583 --> 51:43.166
You don't have to do that.
I'm standing right next to you.

51:43.250 --> 51:45.250
I'm not used to using these stupid things,

51:45.333 --> 51:47.291
and I'm not used
to working with a partner.

51:47.375 --> 51:49.916
We're not partners.
This is a marriage of convenience.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.166
I want a divorce
and I'm keeping the kids.

51:52.250 --> 51:53.583
Let's just do this.

51:53.666 --> 51:56.833
I'll get the thumbprint,
you get Sotto Voce's phone.

We've got a party crasher.

52:32.291 --> 52:35.583
Yeah, it's no biggie. No biggie.
We knew she'd be here.

52:36.208 --> 52:37.750
We're here for the egg, not her.

52:37.833 --> 52:40.041
Speak for yourself. I'm going in.

52:40.791 --> 52:43.208
What are you doing?
That's not part of the plan.

52:55.875 --> 52:58.625
I'm sorry, do we know each other?

It's just impossible for me
to tell who you are with that mask on.

53:09.375 --> 53:10.875

53:11.708 --> 53:13.708

53:15.000 --> 53:18.583
Well, I suppose you and Mr. Booth,
wherever he is,

53:18.666 --> 53:21.125
are here to try to beat me
to the second egg.

-Don't tell her anything.

53:23.875 --> 53:26.291

<i>which means all I need is you.</i>

53:27.625 --> 53:29.250
You're literally telling her everything.

53:29.333 --> 53:34.458
We both know that this whole thing
is gonna end with you in handcuffs.

Promises, promises.

54:05.500 --> 54:07.083
Oh, good, you're dancing with her.

54:08.625 --> 54:10.708
Not bad for a convict.

54:10.791 --> 54:15.583
Speaking of which,
how's it going with your partner in crime?

54:15.666 --> 54:18.083
Has he told you
where the third egg is yet?

54:18.166 --> 54:20.041
Well, if he did, I wouldn't tell you.

54:21.250 --> 54:23.583
That's a no. He must not trust you.

54:26.500 --> 54:27.416
You trust your partner?

54:29.750 --> 54:32.833
Well, no one would be able to pull off
the scores you have alone.

54:32.916 --> 54:34.083
It's impossible.

54:34.208 --> 54:35.125
[scoffs]

54:40.791 --> 54:42.041
So what now?

54:42.125 --> 54:44.083
You're gonna arrest me right here,

54:44.625 --> 54:48.416
without a badge or a gun,
outside of your jurisdiction,

54:49.375 --> 54:52.250
and in front of a room full of criminals?

54:54.625 --> 54:56.666
Is that your plan, Agent Hartley?

54:56.791 --> 54:57.791

didn't think this all the way through.

You're coming with me. Party's over.

55:21.500 --> 55:22.541
[Sotto Voce clears throat]

55:28.208 --> 55:31.583
Watching you dance with this man
at my party has made me quite jealous.

55:31.666 --> 55:33.875
Well, I had to get your attention somehow.

55:35.666 --> 55:36.708
Didn't I?

55:38.375 --> 55:39.291
May I?

55:40.333 --> 55:41.916
Like you said, it's your party.

55:46.708 --> 55:47.583
Apologies.

55:51.375 --> 55:52.541
We needed to get his phone,

55:52.625 --> 55:54.833
not waste time
playing footsie with The Bishop.

55:54.916 --> 55:57.458
Don't worry. I got it.

55:58.458 --> 55:59.625
Excuse me.

56:00.500 --> 56:02.958
You're kidding. Nice pull!

56:03.041 --> 56:04.750
How'd you know Sotto Voce would cut in?

56:04.833 --> 56:09.458
Well, Sotto Voce is a 5'5" alpha male
with textbook Napoleon complex.

56:09.541 --> 56:13.666
So any time another male dances with
the most desirable woman at his party,

56:13.750 --> 56:17.666
well, he has no choice
but to step in and assert his dominance.

56:18.208 --> 56:19.708
You sneaky little minx.

56:19.791 --> 56:21.708
Where'd you learn that? Profiler school?

[in Spanish] I'm so sorry, sir.
[in English] A thousand apologies.

57:13.083 --> 57:15.458
I don't need your apologies,
I need a washroom.

57:15.541 --> 57:16.541
Take him.

57:17.125 --> 57:18.375
Right this way, sir.

57:18.458 --> 57:20.208
[whispers] Let's get you hosed down.

57:20.291 --> 57:24.333
[Sotto Voce] This pistol
was my father's prized possession.

57:24.416 --> 57:27.583
I've kept it close to my heart
since the day I killed him with it.

57:27.666 --> 57:30.541
I was never permitted
to touch this as a boy.

57:30.625 --> 57:31.625
[Booth] Right this way.

57:33.583 --> 57:36.708
[Sotto Voce] <i>It's just like the one</i>
<i>used by the Lone Ranger.</i>

57:38.500 --> 57:39.333
[in Spanish] Hey.

57:39.833 --> 57:41.166
What's going on there?

57:41.250 --> 57:44.083
Someone spilled wine on a guest.
They're cleared.

57:44.166 --> 57:46.166
[speech continues indistinctly]

58:01.458 --> 58:03.333
Something's off. I'm calling it in anyway.

58:03.416 --> 58:07.000
Don't be an idiot.
You read too many spy novels. [scoffs]

-Enjoy your evening.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.083
No, no, no, no, no.

59:24.833 --> 59:26.041
We gotta go.

59:48.041 --> 59:50.250
[Booth] Here we go, nice and easy.

59:51.708 --> 59:52.833
[both grunt]

59:53.333 --> 59:55.500
Oh, my God!

59:55.583 --> 59:57.458
You're like a well-dressed wall.

59:57.541 --> 59:58.583
What are you doing?

59:58.666 --> 59:59.750
Trying to ruin the mission.

59:59.833 --> 1:00:02.166
Well, mission accomplished.
Find the print.

1:00:02.250 --> 1:00:03.083
God damn it!

1:00:03.875 --> 1:00:07.166
Come on, come on, come on,
you little bastard. Where are you?

1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:14.833
Shit!

1:00:19.500 --> 1:00:20.625
Gotcha.

1:00:27.791 --> 1:00:29.708
Phone, phone, phone, phone.

1:00:51.333 --> 1:00:53.416
Okay, it's deepfake time.

1:00:54.625 --> 1:00:56.333
Sotto Voce.

1:01:04.125 --> 1:01:05.083
Right.

1:01:08.250 --> 1:01:10.208
[in Spanish] I thought
Mr. Voce was still at the party?

1:01:12.500 --> 1:01:13.750
Send a team.

1:01:14.416 --> 1:01:17.166
Security, we have a code red.

1:01:20.041 --> 1:01:21.125
[Das in English] Hey!

1:01:24.625 --> 1:01:26.458
You know,
for a guy who claims he's innocent,

1:01:26.541 --> 1:01:28.916
you sure do hang around
with a lot of criminals.

1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:30.375
I am innocent.

1:01:30.458 --> 1:01:32.791
He's a pretty damn good thief
for his first time.

1:01:32.875 --> 1:01:34.333
-I'm not good at it.
-[Booth] You are.

1:01:34.416 --> 1:01:36.041
-Don't say that.
-Don't sell yourself short.

1:01:36.125 --> 1:01:37.625
-Shut up.
-Hector Deflector over here.

1:01:37.708 --> 1:01:39.333
He's not good at taking a compliment.

1:01:39.416 --> 1:01:42.625
I need you to understand,
The Bishop is behind this entire thing.

1:01:42.708 --> 1:01:43.666
She set me up.

1:01:43.750 --> 1:01:47.666
Well, if this is all The Bishop's doing
and you really are innocent, prove it.

1:01:48.916 --> 1:01:52.208
Go on, detain your friend.

1:01:52.291 --> 1:01:53.333
We're not friends.

1:01:53.416 --> 1:01:55.291
-We're work wives.
-We're not work wives.

1:01:55.375 --> 1:01:57.208
-We're sister wives.
-We're not any kind of wives.

1:01:57.291 --> 1:01:58.416
Shut up! Both of you.

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.125
You either arrest him
or I arrest you both.

1:02:03.833 --> 1:02:06.041
What's it gonna be, Agent Hartley?

1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:13.041
-I'm sorry, man.
-Oh…

1:02:13.666 --> 1:02:14.875
Oh, come on!

1:02:14.958 --> 1:02:16.541
-You're under arrest.
-You're gonna listen?

1:02:16.625 --> 1:02:18.500
After all we've been through together…

1:02:24.541 --> 1:02:25.541
[whispers] You love me?

1:02:25.625 --> 1:02:26.791
[whispers] I hate you.

1:02:28.458 --> 1:02:30.666
-[in normal voice] Tight enough? Jesus!
-[sighs] See?

1:02:31.250 --> 1:02:32.333
I'm a good guy.

1:02:33.583 --> 1:02:35.291
But sometimes I do bad things.

[Hartley grunts]

1:02:36.583 --> 1:02:37.916
[Booth grunts]

1:02:40.833 --> 1:02:43.166
-Hartley!
-Let's grab that egg and get out of here.

1:02:43.250 --> 1:02:45.000
You don't wanna talk
about what just happened?

1:02:45.083 --> 1:02:46.708
-What you talking about?
-We had a moment.

1:02:46.791 --> 1:02:49.333
-We didn't have a moment.
-No, we had a moment.

1:02:53.541 --> 1:02:56.750
[regal music playing]

1:03:02.500 --> 1:03:05.583
Looking for something specific
or just browsing?

1:03:06.875 --> 1:03:08.916
You look awful.

1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:13.041
Hmm. You know, there was an easier way in,

1:03:13.125 --> 1:03:16.208
but I doubt very much
that you could've managed it.

1:03:16.291 --> 1:03:17.458
[Booth scoffs]

1:03:17.541 --> 1:03:20.791
Now that I have two out of the three eggs,

1:03:22.666 --> 1:03:25.958
I'll give you one last chance
to take me up on my offer.

1:03:26.583 --> 1:03:28.625
-Well, here's my counteroffer.
-[The Bishop] Mm-hmm.

1:03:28.708 --> 1:03:30.125
-You're under arrest.
-Oh, my God.

1:03:30.208 --> 1:03:31.375
Read the room.

1:03:33.166 --> 1:03:35.958
I told you, this would end
with you in handcuffs.

1:03:36.041 --> 1:03:38.541
You're so embarrassing.
He's so embarrassing.

1:03:39.458 --> 1:03:41.125
Tell you what, Agent Hartley.

1:03:43.083 --> 1:03:44.083
You wanna arrest me?

1:03:44.958 --> 1:03:46.000
Come…

1:03:48.791 --> 1:03:49.833
Arrest me.

1:03:50.583 --> 1:03:52.833
I just want the egg. So, uh--

Sir, we have a problem in the vault room.

1:05:15.458 --> 1:05:16.458
Excuse me.

Bro, I didn't…
I didn't see the handcuffs coming.

1:06:05.291 --> 1:06:06.916
Mm, was a nice touch.

1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:09.166
God, this is such a confusing erection.

1:06:09.250 --> 1:06:10.750
You can't ever tell anybody about this.

1:06:10.833 --> 1:06:13.125
-[Booth] I'll never tell anybody. Promise.
-[Hartley] Okay.

1:06:14.958 --> 1:06:17.916
[footsteps approaching]

1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:18.833
[Booth] Okay.

1:06:18.916 --> 1:06:21.750
Oh, whoa, hold on, hold on.
No, don't shoot.

1:06:22.750 --> 1:06:25.750
I'm not trying to be a tattletale.
We didn't steal your egg, okay?

1:06:25.833 --> 1:06:27.041
I mean, we tried.

1:06:27.958 --> 1:06:28.958
But she got it.

1:06:29.666 --> 1:06:31.208
[Hartley] He's telling you the truth.

1:06:31.708 --> 1:06:32.875
Is that so?

1:06:35.125 --> 1:06:37.708
Thank you. Oh. All right.

1:06:43.750 --> 1:06:46.958
Would you like to make
a confession, my lady?

1:06:49.125 --> 1:06:51.166
It's a pleasure doing business with you.

1:06:51.750 --> 1:06:53.250
I told you they'd come.

1:06:58.291 --> 1:06:59.625
[laughing] Oh, ho, ho, ho.

Good morning, gentlemen.

1:07:26.666 --> 1:07:28.541
[both breathing heavily]

1:07:28.625 --> 1:07:32.291
Down here, beneath the bulls,
no one will hear your screams.

1:07:32.375 --> 1:07:34.291
[exhales] That's called foreshadowing.

1:07:34.375 --> 1:07:35.916
-I know what it's called.
-Was making sure.

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:38.000
You don't look like an English major.

1:07:38.083 --> 1:07:40.875
-Shut up.
<i>-Buongiorno, </i>everybody!

1:07:40.958 --> 1:07:43.208
-Perfect!
-[sing-song] I brought champagne.

1:07:43.291 --> 1:07:45.750
I would introduce you,
but I believe you've already met

1:07:45.833 --> 1:07:47.250
my lovely business associate.

1:07:47.333 --> 1:07:48.166
[Booth] Yes.

1:07:48.250 --> 1:07:50.291
I told you The Bishop
was working with somebody.

1:07:50.375 --> 1:07:52.541
It's a marriage of convenience.

1:07:52.625 --> 1:07:55.416
You're familiar with that concept,
aren't you?

1:07:56.666 --> 1:07:59.708
You see, the dashing Mr. Voce here

1:07:59.791 --> 1:08:02.125
already held the second egg
in his possession.

1:08:02.208 --> 1:08:05.000
So, I approached him with my own offer,

1:08:05.083 --> 1:08:07.458
which brings us to the part

1:08:07.541 --> 1:08:12.166
where you tell us where the third egg is.

1:08:13.416 --> 1:08:15.958
[both laugh]

1:08:20.083 --> 1:08:21.958
Piss off for a thousand years.

1:08:23.208 --> 1:08:25.916
Oh, bummer.
I really wanted to do it the easy way.

1:08:26.500 --> 1:08:31.625
That's okay. I'll get the information
from you by hurting him.

1:08:33.083 --> 1:08:34.208
I'm sorry, what?

1:08:34.291 --> 1:08:35.666
I love this plan.

1:08:39.041 --> 1:08:41.333
[The Bishop] You two share a special bond.

1:08:41.416 --> 1:08:43.833
Otherwise, why would you
risk your lives together

1:08:43.916 --> 1:08:45.250
attempting to steal the egg?

1:08:45.333 --> 1:08:48.125
Isn't that right, Agent Hartley?

1:08:48.208 --> 1:08:50.875
There is no bond between us.
I barely know the guy.

1:08:50.958 --> 1:08:52.916
Booth, tell her we're not friends.

1:08:54.791 --> 1:08:56.791
-She knows about us, pal.
-That's bullshit.

1:08:56.875 --> 1:08:59.250
She knows about our special bond,
that you were my best man.

1:08:59.333 --> 1:09:00.375
Son of a bitch. He's lying.

1:09:00.958 --> 1:09:04.000
If she hurts you bad enough,
if she gets really creative with it,

1:09:04.083 --> 1:09:06.208
I'm gonna have no choice
but to tell her everything.

1:09:07.041 --> 1:09:11.333
Now, Mr. Booth, where is the third egg?

1:09:12.916 --> 1:09:15.583
Okay, here I go.

1:09:15.666 --> 1:09:17.250
[lazily] No, don't. Wait.

I guess now we find out what kind
of friend you really are, Mr. Booth,

1:09:36.708 --> 1:09:39.416

Okay, stop, stop.
I'll tell you, all right?

1:10:35.833 --> 1:10:38.166
-It's in Egypt.
-[The Bishop] Where in Egypt?

1:10:38.833 --> 1:10:40.875
[Booth] There's a hidden chamber
in the Great Pyramid.

1:10:40.958 --> 1:10:43.416
Lidar discovered it a year ago.
They haven't opened it yet.

1:10:43.500 --> 1:10:46.833
-How do you know the egg is there?
-My mother was an Egyptologist.

1:10:46.916 --> 1:10:49.333
I could read hieroglyphics
before I could read English.

1:10:49.875 --> 1:10:52.000
That hidden chamber

1:10:53.166 --> 1:10:56.166
is the secret tomb of Cleopatra.

1:10:56.750 --> 1:10:59.791
They buried the third egg there
when the other two went missing.

1:10:59.875 --> 1:11:02.416
The scans show it
sitting there plain as day.

1:11:04.666 --> 1:11:06.250
The third egg never left Egypt.

1:11:08.958 --> 1:11:11.791
He's not lying. I read about the chamber.

1:11:14.291 --> 1:11:15.666
Was that so hard?

1:11:18.916 --> 1:11:20.750

-Oh, come on.

1:11:47.875 --> 1:11:50.166
You didn't see that coming, amateur hour?

1:11:50.750 --> 1:11:51.750
Guard!

1:11:51.833 --> 1:11:55.208
I don't know what happened.
We were just having a glass of champagne

1:11:55.291 --> 1:11:57.291
-when all of the sudden he fell.
-[guard grunts]

1:11:59.166 --> 1:12:01.083
And scene.

1:12:01.583 --> 1:12:02.750
Long con?

1:12:03.333 --> 1:12:04.250
Long con.

1:12:04.333 --> 1:12:06.583
You know, lady,
I'm really starting to not like you.

1:12:07.416 --> 1:12:11.583
Now I'd really love to stay and see
how this whole thing turns out,

1:12:11.666 --> 1:12:17.041
but I'm late for a date
with a very large pyramid.

1:12:17.916 --> 1:12:19.833
Can't wait to see what happens next.

1:12:19.916 --> 1:12:21.250
So exciting!

1:12:31.791 --> 1:12:34.666
You should have took that deal
when she offered it to you in prison.

1:12:34.750 --> 1:12:36.875
Well, you shouldn't have
got us caught by her boyfriend.

1:12:36.958 --> 1:12:38.541
Oh, how did I get us caught
by her boyfriend?

1:12:38.625 --> 1:12:41.083
Well, if you don't know that,
then you really are dumber than I look.

1:12:41.166 --> 1:12:42.291
[screams]

1:12:42.375 --> 1:12:45.416

[groaning]

1:12:49.166 --> 1:12:53.333
[Booth, distorted] Oh, you look busted.
You look like a zombie.

1:12:55.375 --> 1:12:56.333
You did this.

1:12:56.416 --> 1:12:59.666
This is your fault. She was mine.

1:12:59.750 --> 1:13:03.291
[Booth] Honey, honey, honey,
homegirl is a hard ten.

1:13:04.208 --> 1:13:05.666
And you look like…

1:13:06.458 --> 1:13:08.500
Like a muscular toddler.

1:13:09.083 --> 1:13:10.791
I don't think it was gonna work.

1:13:11.541 --> 1:13:13.666

-Oh, shit.

-[Booth] Whoa, whoa. Hold on.

1:13:19.083 --> 1:13:21.083
Let's talk about this. [screaming]

1:13:23.208 --> 1:13:25.875
-John, you hit?
-[Hartley] No, surprisingly not.

1:13:25.958 --> 1:13:28.083
[Booth] What? How is that possible?

-He shot the cuff.
-He hit something?

1:13:40.583 --> 1:13:41.416
Lucky shot.

1:13:41.500 --> 1:13:42.791
We're gonna get out of here.

1:13:43.333 --> 1:13:44.666
We're really gonna do it.

1:13:45.291 --> 1:13:48.125
Oh, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, where are you goin'? We're partners.

1:13:48.208 --> 1:13:50.583
Oh, we're partners now?
No, our partnership ended

1:13:50.666 --> 1:13:53.208
when you let The Bishop
go all shock therapy on me.

1:13:53.291 --> 1:13:55.833
You're not gonna find The Bishop.
Not without me.

1:13:55.916 --> 1:13:58.333
I got a pretty good idea
where she's going because of you.

1:13:58.416 --> 1:14:00.541
-So, goodbye.
-I lied.

1:14:05.333 --> 1:14:07.000
-I lied.
-What do you mean, "you lied"?

1:14:07.083 --> 1:14:09.083
I lied about everything.
All of it. That whole thing.

1:14:09.166 --> 1:14:12.000
I lied to you, I lied to her,
I lied to Baby Jesus.

1:14:12.791 --> 1:14:13.625
All of 'em.

1:14:15.458 --> 1:14:20.750
Look, the point is,
is that the third egg isn't in Egypt.

1:14:20.833 --> 1:14:22.541
Right. I don't give a shit about the egg.

1:14:22.625 --> 1:14:25.416
I care about arresting The Bishop
and clearing my name.

1:14:25.500 --> 1:14:28.583
Right. But you won't get to The Bishop
unless you get to the egg.

1:14:28.666 --> 1:14:30.250
And I know where the egg is.

1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:32.291
Just get me out of here.

1:14:32.375 --> 1:14:34.500
I'll get the egg
and you'll get The Bishop.

1:14:35.916 --> 1:14:36.916
Come on!

1:14:39.041 --> 1:14:40.416
[softly] Pretty please?

1:15:02.666 --> 1:15:03.500
Up here.

1:15:04.125 --> 1:15:07.000
We'll disappear into the crowd.
We'll be home free.

-No, no. Don't move. Don't move.
-Why?

1:15:37.750 --> 1:15:40.708
Bulls have terrible eyesight.
But they can sense motion.

1:15:40.791 --> 1:15:42.208
You're thinking of <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

1:15:42.291 --> 1:15:45.708
No! I saw a nature documentary
starring David Attenborough.

1:15:45.791 --> 1:15:48.958
You're thinking of Richard Attenborough
from <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

was Jeff Goldblum in it?

That's Jeff Goldblum.

What's your problem?

1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:40.000
Don't run?

1:16:40.708 --> 1:16:41.958
Don't run?

1:16:43.166 --> 1:16:45.000
[Booth] You gonna be
this grumpy the whole trip?

1:16:45.083 --> 1:16:47.166
Wait till you see our ride.
You're gonna love it.

1:16:56.208 --> 1:16:58.750
This is fun, isn't it?

1:16:58.833 --> 1:17:01.000
Riding the rails hobo-style.

1:17:01.083 --> 1:17:04.166
You ever see, um, uh, <i>Sullivan's Travels?</i>

No, I haven't.

1:17:05.791 --> 1:17:07.833
And no, it's not, all right? Cough it up.

1:17:07.916 --> 1:17:09.708
Where are we headed?
Where's the third egg?

1:17:09.791 --> 1:17:11.416
All right, fine.

1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:15.041
I've been thinking about this a lot,
and I can't tell you.

1:17:15.750 --> 1:17:17.208
What do you mean, you can't tell me?

1:17:17.291 --> 1:17:20.083
It's not so much of a "can't,"
it's more of a "won't."

1:17:21.458 --> 1:17:22.375
[exclaims]

1:17:23.916 --> 1:17:25.375
Take me to the third egg, Booth.

1:17:25.458 --> 1:17:26.958
[train horn blowing]

[suspenseful music playing]

1:17:33.500 --> 1:17:34.541
Do it.

1:17:35.416 --> 1:17:36.583
You can't, can you?

1:17:37.125 --> 1:17:40.000
'Cause even though you're
running around with me, playing the thief,

1:17:40.958 --> 1:17:42.916
you're not a real bad guy, Bubba.

Let's get something straight right now.

1:17:58.250 --> 1:17:59.416
That was terrifying.

1:18:00.708 --> 1:18:03.791
Look, it's not that
I don't care about you.

1:18:03.875 --> 1:18:06.041
It's that I don't care about anyone.

1:18:08.458 --> 1:18:09.416
My dad was a crook.

1:18:11.875 --> 1:18:13.083
A con man, actually.

1:18:13.166 --> 1:18:15.291
[emotional music playing]

1:18:15.375 --> 1:18:16.375
He was the best.

1:18:17.708 --> 1:18:20.833
Then on my 13th birthday,
he didn't show up.

1:18:21.333 --> 1:18:23.291
My mom and I never saw him again.

1:18:27.916 --> 1:18:28.750
Wow.

1:18:30.916 --> 1:18:32.916
We really got some dads, huh?

1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:35.041
It's a miracle we're not both strippers.

1:18:35.125 --> 1:18:36.833
[chuckles] Yeah.

1:18:36.916 --> 1:18:39.250
[chuckles]

1:18:40.541 --> 1:18:43.666
Look, your dad was a cop,
so you became a crook.

1:18:44.291 --> 1:18:46.583
My dad was a crook, so I became a cop.

1:18:47.250 --> 1:18:48.500
We're not that different.

1:18:49.166 --> 1:18:51.291
I'm not asking you
to care about me, Booth.

1:18:52.416 --> 1:18:53.791
I'm asking you to help me.

1:18:54.666 --> 1:18:58.625
Help me catch The Bishop
and clear my name,

1:18:58.708 --> 1:19:02.916
and I will help you become the number one
art thief in the world again.

1:19:04.875 --> 1:19:07.250
It's the only chance I have
to get my life back.

and hiking in circles for eight hours.

1:22:07.208 --> 1:22:08.750
That map better be right.

1:22:09.333 --> 1:22:11.000
[Booth] Relax, we'll find it.

1:22:11.083 --> 1:22:12.750
[Hartley] Say we find it.

1:22:12.833 --> 1:22:14.916
How can you be sure
the egg is actually there?

1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:18.166
-[Booth] What do you mean?
-I get that Rudolph the red-nosed Nazi guy

1:22:18.250 --> 1:22:21.166
is rumored to be the last person
to ever hold the egg in his hands,

1:22:21.250 --> 1:22:25.666
and that this mystery bunker is rumored
to have all this stolen treasure.

1:22:25.750 --> 1:22:28.708
How can you be sure
the third egg itself is actually there?

1:22:28.791 --> 1:22:29.625
Faith.

1:22:31.916 --> 1:22:32.750
Faith?

1:22:32.833 --> 1:22:34.291
I'm sorry, I just wanna be clear.

1:22:34.375 --> 1:22:37.541
So we're out in the middle of nowhere

not into the whole religious thing.

No.

1:22:47.166 --> 1:22:50.250
Relax. I have good news.
If I'm reading this map right…

1:22:51.833 --> 1:22:52.666
We're here.

1:22:52.750 --> 1:22:54.083
-We're where?
-We've arrived.

1:22:54.166 --> 1:22:55.208
X marks the spot.

1:22:55.291 --> 1:22:58.041
X… What spot? X marks the spot.

1:22:58.125 --> 1:23:00.416
We're here. Here it is. Great job!

1:23:00.500 --> 1:23:02.875
-Please don't yell at me.
-You found it! Booth found it.

1:23:02.958 --> 1:23:04.750
There's no bunker. There's shit here.

1:23:04.833 --> 1:23:06.958
-I'm just telling you what the map says.
-There's no bunker.

1:23:07.041 --> 1:23:08.416
Tell me, what does the map say?

1:23:09.208 --> 1:23:11.125
Oh, shit!

1:23:13.166 --> 1:23:14.916
Yeah, it's gonna be a long walk back.

1:23:15.958 --> 1:23:17.875
You know what I blame?
I blame the compass.

1:23:17.958 --> 1:23:20.541
I got this thing back in Scouts.
It's been a little wonky.

1:23:20.625 --> 1:23:22.208
It was never my strong suit.

1:23:22.291 --> 1:23:23.416
-Can I see this?
-Absolutely.

1:23:23.500 --> 1:23:24.708
-Can I see this?
-Of course.

1:23:26.375 --> 1:23:27.375
I see what the problem is.

1:23:28.125 --> 1:23:29.916
-That's the problem.
-Oh. That is not kind.

1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:32.583
You know what's not kind?
Dragging me out in the middle of nowhere,

1:23:32.666 --> 1:23:35.166
halfway around the world,
based on a goddamn hunch!

1:23:35.250 --> 1:23:36.458
[metal clangs]

1:23:38.375 --> 1:23:42.125
[triumphant music playing]

1:24:29.916 --> 1:24:31.000
[Booth] Holy shit!

1:24:44.708 --> 1:24:46.708
[Booth whistling "The Raiders March"]

1:24:51.125 --> 1:24:51.958
[whistling stops]

1:25:00.583 --> 1:25:02.583
Guess they're paying the utilities.

1:25:04.291 --> 1:25:06.041
It's gotta be hydroelectric power,

1:25:06.791 --> 1:25:09.083
which means there's
running water somewhere down here.

1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:14.750
Look at that door.
Nothing hiding behind there.

1:25:19.708 --> 1:25:21.291
How are we gonna get through this?

1:25:24.791 --> 1:25:28.041
Oh, shit!

1:25:29.666 --> 1:25:32.375
You have got to be kidding.

1:25:38.458 --> 1:25:39.833
Is that your father's watch?

1:25:39.916 --> 1:25:43.083
No. It's the watch from <i>Pulp Fiction.</i>

1:25:43.666 --> 1:25:45.375
Yes, it's my father's watch.

1:25:46.083 --> 1:25:49.458
-I thought you said you smashed it.
-I had it repaired. Is that a problem?

1:25:49.541 --> 1:25:52.125
No, it's not a problem.
Glad you're not touchy about it.

1:25:52.208 --> 1:25:53.208
Please shut up.

1:25:56.416 --> 1:25:57.250
[clangs]

1:25:57.333 --> 1:25:59.250
Uh, fun with magnets. All right.

1:26:02.500 --> 1:26:04.875
[clicking]

1:26:11.708 --> 1:26:12.833
Dad…

1:26:15.333 --> 1:26:16.875
Please be good crazy.

1:26:21.416 --> 1:26:24.166
-[clicking]
-[dull thud]

1:26:24.250 --> 1:26:26.500
-[chains rattling]
-[metal thudding]

1:26:28.500 --> 1:26:29.750
[thudding stops]

1:26:40.791 --> 1:26:42.208
[both grunting]

1:27:19.833 --> 1:27:22.208
Forget the egg,
let's just steal this stuff.

1:27:22.291 --> 1:27:24.166
[Hartley]
We're not here to steal anything.

1:27:24.250 --> 1:27:27.375
Uh, actually we are.
We're here to steal the egg.

1:27:27.458 --> 1:27:28.666
[Hartley] You know what I mean.

1:27:29.250 --> 1:27:32.083
[Booth] Oh, I steal it, it's stealing,
and you steal it, it's what?

1:27:32.166 --> 1:27:34.250
How about we just shut up?
And by we, I mean you.

1:27:34.333 --> 1:27:35.791
[Booth] You're also rude too.

1:27:36.833 --> 1:27:38.666
Rude to boot.

1:27:39.708 --> 1:27:41.541
[Hartley] How are we gonna find this egg?

1:27:41.625 --> 1:27:42.833
[Booth] I don't know.

1:27:43.375 --> 1:27:45.750
Look for a box that says "MacGuffin."

1:28:02.625 --> 1:28:03.791
Oh!

1:28:03.875 --> 1:28:05.333
Do you know what this is?

1:28:05.833 --> 1:28:07.708
This is…

1:28:07.791 --> 1:28:12.875
Yes, this is
a 1931 Mercedes-Benz Grosser 770.

1:28:13.541 --> 1:28:16.041
I could flip this for $25 million, easy.

1:28:16.125 --> 1:28:18.625
There's, like, three of these left
on the planet. Four!

1:28:19.500 --> 1:28:21.000
There's four now.

1:28:21.083 --> 1:28:22.458
Three quarter-inch steel,

1:28:22.541 --> 1:28:25.125
reinforced armor-plating,
bullet-resistant glass,

1:28:25.208 --> 1:28:27.625
and a 24-karat gold inlay.

1:28:28.208 --> 1:28:29.833
This is a convertible tank.

1:28:29.916 --> 1:28:32.833
And it's in mint condition.
I bet you this thing still runs.

1:28:32.916 --> 1:28:34.750
Too bad it was driven by Nazi scum.

1:28:34.833 --> 1:28:36.333
It's a shame we're gonna have to burn it.

1:28:36.416 --> 1:28:38.250
How did they get it down here anyway?

1:28:38.333 --> 1:28:41.416
They carry it down the stairs
in tiny pieces and reassemble?

1:28:41.500 --> 1:28:42.416
Through there.

1:28:44.750 --> 1:28:47.416
Place must have been built off
one of those old copper mines.

1:28:47.500 --> 1:28:50.208
The shafts down here are massive
and go on for miles.

1:28:50.791 --> 1:28:53.958
Build the bunker, bring in the loot,
seal the shaft…

1:28:54.041 --> 1:28:55.083
Bob's your uncle.

1:28:55.625 --> 1:28:57.000
Who's your daddy?

1:28:57.083 --> 1:28:58.708
[Hartley] That's not how it goes.

1:28:58.791 --> 1:28:59.875
[Booth] I know.

1:29:04.125 --> 1:29:08.458
Well, labels, Nazis, dum-dums.

1:29:13.583 --> 1:29:15.750
[Booth guffawing]

1:29:15.833 --> 1:29:19.000
[triumphant music playing]

1:29:22.916 --> 1:29:23.791
[clangs]

1:29:28.875 --> 1:29:29.833
Five-second rule.

1:29:29.916 --> 1:29:33.791
It's fine. Totally fine.
Not a scratch on it.

1:29:33.875 --> 1:29:36.625
Are you sure you don't wanna
flip this one? I got a guy.

1:29:36.708 --> 1:29:38.416
Let me save you the trouble.

1:29:39.458 --> 1:29:40.666
[sighs]

1:29:40.750 --> 1:29:42.916
Your entrances are bullshit.

1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:44.375
Egypt? [scoffs]

1:29:45.041 --> 1:29:48.458
Did you really think I ran right off
to the pyramids on your good word?

1:29:48.541 --> 1:29:51.500
All I had to do was wait for you two
to escape from Sotto Voce,

1:29:51.583 --> 1:29:53.750
and you led me right to the third egg,

1:29:53.833 --> 1:29:55.875
which I'm going to take from you now.

1:29:56.666 --> 1:29:59.333
So, uh, hand it over.

1:30:00.375 --> 1:30:01.916
Come on, don't be shy.

1:30:05.083 --> 1:30:07.583
[mockingly] Good job. Attaboy.

1:30:08.375 --> 1:30:09.625
-[door opens]
-[cocks gun]

1:30:09.708 --> 1:30:10.833
Drop your weapon!

1:30:13.541 --> 1:30:14.875
[rapid gunshots]

1:30:14.958 --> 1:30:16.791
[in Spanish] This way! On that side.

1:30:20.625 --> 1:30:22.291
[in English] How did she find us?

1:30:22.375 --> 1:30:24.791
I followed you. She must have followed me.

1:30:26.833 --> 1:30:27.791
No shit!

1:30:31.041 --> 1:30:33.458
Why are you shooting at them?
I thought you were on their side.

1:30:33.541 --> 1:30:35.666
I am on their side. They shot at me first.

1:30:37.500 --> 1:30:39.166
How are we gonna get out of here?

1:30:41.916 --> 1:30:42.833
We take that.

1:30:43.416 --> 1:30:45.583
I don't think that's
gonna make it up the stairs.

1:30:46.250 --> 1:30:48.500
-[cocks gun]
-It ain't going up the stairs.

1:30:50.291 --> 1:30:51.166
Cover us.

1:30:53.458 --> 1:30:55.208
[officers shouting]

1:31:02.458 --> 1:31:03.333
[engine cranks]

1:31:07.500 --> 1:31:09.416
-Go, go, go!
-I'm trying!

1:31:09.500 --> 1:31:10.500
Let's go.

1:31:11.833 --> 1:31:13.916
-[engine starts]
-Huh? Ha-ha!

1:31:21.208 --> 1:31:23.000
[officers shouting in Spanish]

1:31:29.833 --> 1:31:30.791
Let's go!

1:31:33.208 --> 1:31:34.375
-Throw it.
-What?

1:31:34.458 --> 1:31:35.291
Now!

1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:49.166
[Das in Spanish]
You two with me, the rest of you follow.

1:31:49.250 --> 1:31:50.083
Go!

1:31:52.625 --> 1:31:53.958
[engines revving]

1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:14.250
[in English] I'm all out.

1:32:30.500 --> 1:32:31.708
[grunts]

1:32:33.916 --> 1:32:35.416
[in Spanish] Pull over!

1:32:37.083 --> 1:32:37.958
[grunts]

1:32:38.750 --> 1:32:40.625
[both grunting]

1:32:44.500 --> 1:32:47.125

-[male officer] Shit!

1:32:59.666 --> 1:33:00.833
[exclaims]

Whoa!

1:33:04.458 --> 1:33:05.708

[in English] Bishop, the egg!

[dramatic music playing]

1:34:27.708 --> 1:34:29.125
[laughs]

1:34:30.458 --> 1:34:32.208
[grunting]

1:34:39.250 --> 1:34:40.458
[Booth] You saved me.

1:34:40.541 --> 1:34:43.500
You love me. You love me like crazy.

1:34:51.333 --> 1:34:52.958
-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
-Shit!

1:34:58.208 --> 1:34:59.458
We're running out of road.

1:35:00.041 --> 1:35:02.916
Hold on to something!
If we stop, they'll catch us.

1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:04.583
Then let's get caught.

1:35:04.666 --> 1:35:07.416
We can escape later.
It works for me all the time.

1:35:07.500 --> 1:35:09.666
Make sure to kick clear of the car.

1:35:09.750 --> 1:35:12.333
-I would like to workshop this idea.
-Oh, shit!

1:35:17.250 --> 1:35:18.500
[exclaiming]

1:35:26.791 --> 1:35:28.041

1:35:54.625 --> 1:35:56.208
[gasping]

1:36:08.250 --> 1:36:09.083
[panting]

1:36:12.583 --> 1:36:14.291
It's just like we drew it up, right?

1:36:16.375 --> 1:36:17.375
Hartley?

1:36:20.041 --> 1:36:21.083
Hartley?

1:36:29.500 --> 1:36:30.458
Hartley?

1:36:36.833 --> 1:36:38.166
You will be missed.

1:36:43.791 --> 1:36:44.916
[groans softly]

1:36:47.791 --> 1:36:51.125
Oh, shit! God damn it.

1:36:51.208 --> 1:36:52.125
Hartley?

1:36:53.291 --> 1:36:56.000
Hartley? Hartley?

1:36:56.541 --> 1:36:58.708
Hey, where are you, you big idiot?

1:36:58.791 --> 1:37:00.375
[Hartley] Who are you calling an idiot?

1:37:01.541 --> 1:37:02.458
I'm right here.

1:37:10.250 --> 1:37:12.291
-Did you just choose me over the egg?
-No.

1:37:12.375 --> 1:37:14.791
-Well, it kinda looks like you did.
-I didn't.

1:37:14.875 --> 1:37:16.541
You went running in there to rescue me.

1:37:16.625 --> 1:37:18.041
I left my phone in there.

1:37:18.666 --> 1:37:21.000
You only have
a finite amount of time to save it.

1:37:21.083 --> 1:37:23.000
Stick it in a bag of rice,
it's a whole thing.

1:37:23.083 --> 1:37:24.291
You thought I was dead.

1:37:24.375 --> 1:37:26.291
I didn't think you were dead.
I wished you were dead.

1:37:26.375 --> 1:37:28.958
I saw you splashing around.
"Hartley! Hartley!"

1:37:29.041 --> 1:37:31.791
Yes, okay, I wanted to pull you out,

1:37:31.875 --> 1:37:35.250
save you, get your hopes up,
and then pull you, shove you under.

1:37:35.333 --> 1:37:37.333
[panting]

1:37:49.333 --> 1:37:52.291
Look, I'm not gonna
make a big deal out of this.

1:37:53.166 --> 1:37:55.250
I'm not gonna gloat. It's not who I am.

1:37:55.333 --> 1:37:57.791
Would some people say
that this is very embarrassing for you?

1:37:57.875 --> 1:37:59.958
Yes, of course. Of course they would.

1:38:00.041 --> 1:38:02.125
Probably everybody.

1:38:03.083 --> 1:38:04.541
But that's not important right now.

1:38:04.625 --> 1:38:08.000
What's important is that
you realize you lost and I won.

1:38:08.083 --> 1:38:08.916
We.

1:38:09.791 --> 1:38:13.125
We won. Together. Friendship. Teamwork.

1:38:13.208 --> 1:38:14.875
It's called the moral of the story.

1:38:14.958 --> 1:38:18.041
And something that I've been
wanting to say for years

1:38:18.125 --> 1:38:19.541
to your face is…

1:38:20.333 --> 1:38:21.500
Checkmate.

1:38:22.375 --> 1:38:23.625
Oh, that feels good.

1:38:23.708 --> 1:38:26.291
I've got two eggs, you've got one,
and you think you won?

1:38:27.333 --> 1:38:28.708
How's that work exactly?

1:38:28.791 --> 1:38:31.333
I don't have to win
in order for you to lose.

1:38:31.416 --> 1:38:33.500
That's the best part of this whole thing.

1:38:33.583 --> 1:38:36.416
As long as I have the third egg,
you can't win.

1:38:37.250 --> 1:38:38.708
I don't care about the money anymore.

1:38:38.791 --> 1:38:40.416
Honestly, look at your face right now.

1:38:40.500 --> 1:38:42.583
That face right there.
Just… Yeah. Perfect.

1:38:42.666 --> 1:38:46.666
