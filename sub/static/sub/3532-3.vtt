00:12.378 --> 00:13.538
Holy shit!

00:13.713 --> 00:16.511
That was incredible.

00:17.317 --> 00:18.841
You want a sip?

00:19.018 --> 00:22.681
No. I can't drink spirits
if I'm gonna be driving, Kenny.

00:23.923 --> 00:27.689
Oh, fuck.
I'm so drunk I feel retarded.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.089
I fucking do.

00:29.262 --> 00:34.427
I know I shouldn't use that word,
but that's how I feel right now, man.

00:34.601 --> 00:39.038
You're so fucking badass, Kenny.
Man, you're so fucking-

00:39.205 --> 00:44.666
You say, "You fucking mess with me,
I throw a brick in your face!"

00:44.844 --> 00:46.812
Smashing a brick through
a dude's window...

00:46.980 --> 00:49.540
...is nothing compared
to the things I've done.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.274
And I've killed people.

00:51.451 --> 00:53.009
You know what I wish?

00:53.186 --> 00:56.349
I wish I could just hang around you
all the time...

00:56.523 --> 00:59.856
...and just, like, do whatever you do...

01:00.026 --> 01:04.053
...and just, like, learn from you
and aid you.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.698
- Aid me?
- Yeah, you know, like-

01:06.866 --> 01:11.701
Like a good friend
that will be there for you always.

01:11.871 --> 01:14.965
- Like an assistant?
- Yeah- No-

01:15.141 --> 01:18.474
Yeah, or like- Like a-
Like a best friend.

01:18.645 --> 01:21.307
Fuck, dude, an assistant.

01:21.481 --> 01:23.745
I mean, dude, that could be
just the fucking key.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.908
I'm trying to get back
into the big leagues.

01:26.085 --> 01:27.746
That's a huge task.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.185
I could use somebody like you.

01:30.356 --> 01:33.450
Just do all my bullshit.
My fucking running around.

01:33.626 --> 01:37.790
Then I can just have time
just to focus up on the day-to-day.

01:37.964 --> 01:42.298
Motherfucker!
That's Clegg in my fucking truck!

01:42.468 --> 01:44.060
Hold on to your dick!

01:54.647 --> 01:56.342
Hey.

01:57.550 --> 02:00.018
You still with us, buddy?

02:01.221 --> 02:03.587
What-? What happened?

02:03.756 --> 02:06.054
You were driving
and you smashed into this boat...

02:06.226 --> 02:07.853
...because you were drunk.

02:08.026 --> 02:10.791
No- What-? You were driving.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.228
You were driving.
I was in the passenger seat.

02:13.399 --> 02:17.199
- I'm lucky to be alive.
- No, you-

02:18.004 --> 02:20.666
You were driving,
because you're my assistant...

02:20.840 --> 02:22.569
...and that's what my assistant does:

02:22.742 --> 02:24.801
he drives me around
when I get shit-hammered.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.937
What-? Am-?
Am I really your assistant?

02:29.115 --> 02:33.677
I don't know. That depends.
Were you driving?

02:36.256 --> 02:37.655
Yes.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.224
Yes, I was driving.

02:40.393 --> 02:43.521
Yes, of course you were.
Of course you were.

02:43.696 --> 02:48.224
All right, well, I'm gonna split
because I got priors...

02:48.401 --> 02:49.561
...but see you at school.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.500
What in the hell?

03:06.886 --> 03:10.219
All right, now, I want this stuff
categorized, inventorized...

03:10.390 --> 03:13.154
I'm not paying y'all 2 bucks an hour
for nothing, all right?

03:13.326 --> 03:16.022
That is a foam middle finger.
How many of those do we have?

03:16.195 --> 03:17.856
- We have 16.
- Sixteen.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.658
This is worth millions of dollars.

03:19.832 --> 03:22.528
I don't want sweat
and little-kid fingerprints on it.

03:24.070 --> 03:26.834
What's this thing
doing out in the driveway?

03:27.707 --> 03:31.268
People will buy this shit.
Sixteen or 17? Sixteen?

03:31.444 --> 03:33.036
- Kenny, what-?
- What's up, Dustin?

03:33.212 --> 03:34.702
What's all this junk doing here?

03:34.881 --> 03:37.543
Dustin, this "junk" is the answer
to all our prayers, man.

03:37.717 --> 03:40.185
I'm gonna sell this memorabilia.
We can make millions.

03:40.353 --> 03:45.222
- Millions of dollars? Toilet seat, Kenny?
- Well, this toilet seat is a collectors' item.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.655
It's valued at over $2000,
I have a thousand.

03:47.827 --> 03:50.227
Look: Opens up,
you take shits through the middle.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.863
Did you fall and bump your head?

03:52.031 --> 03:54.431
- What are you talking-?
- Gotta be out of your mind.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.033
Who's gonna buy this shit?

03:56.202 --> 03:59.069
Excuse me
for being a fucking businessman, Dustin.

03:59.238 --> 04:01.706
You could learn something
instead of just criticizing.

04:01.874 --> 04:06.072
Or just stay good at what you're doing,
which is, I guess, being poor.

04:06.245 --> 04:10.306
If you really wanna sell this stuff,
just put it on eBay. I could list it for you.

04:10.483 --> 04:12.576
Don't put yourself through
something with him.

04:12.752 --> 04:15.778
I don't appreciate your tone with me.
Cassie, fantastic idea.

04:15.955 --> 04:18.651
I would love to talk to you
one-on-one about said proposal.

04:18.825 --> 04:22.727
- Minus dickhead here.
- No, Cass.

04:23.262 --> 04:25.822
Well, look at that.

04:25.998 --> 04:30.094
Wayne's Triple H sweatshirt
just sold for $15.

04:30.269 --> 04:32.032
Oh, I love that.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.969
Gives me a little charge. That's so fun.

04:35.141 --> 04:38.304
Okay, so basically,
we're gonna post your things online...

04:38.478 --> 04:42.847
...and then people will make bids on them.
You know, kind of like an auction.

04:43.015 --> 04:45.506
And then the highest bid wins.

04:45.685 --> 04:48.916
Cassie, I know how the fuck eBay works.
What I wanna know is how much.

04:49.088 --> 04:50.419
Okay, well, here's the thing.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.581
You don't know
what the market's gonna be...

04:52.759 --> 04:55.159
...until you actually do
post your things online.

04:55.328 --> 04:59.094
Cassie, I'm talking about how much.
How much for you? What's your commish?

04:59.265 --> 05:03.361
- What's the damage?
- Kenny, I don't want anything from you.

05:03.536 --> 05:06.562
- Okay? I'm not gonna charge you.
- Then why are you doing it?

05:07.740 --> 05:11.540
Loved ones, such as yourself,
are a blessing to me in our family...

05:11.711 --> 05:16.614
...and we bestow our feelings of love
towards you...

05:18.317 --> 05:20.444
...by being generous and blessful.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.611
I don't know. Sounds a little fishy.

05:25.558 --> 05:28.891
Look at that. You see that?
That's where my dick goes through.

05:29.796 --> 05:31.661
Okay, you know what?

05:31.831 --> 05:34.698
I'm starting to see what's possible here.

05:34.867 --> 05:37.461
I mean, maybe this is fate.
You know?

05:37.637 --> 05:40.731
I mean, maybe it is fated
that you are here on this earth...

05:40.907 --> 05:43.569
...to move these treasures for me.
I mean, think about it.

05:43.743 --> 05:46.143
What are the chances that
I'd have all this stuff...

05:46.312 --> 05:50.908
...be staying here with you guys,
and then you know how to do eBay good?

05:53.419 --> 05:54.750
Maybe this is what God wants.

05:54.921 --> 05:58.152
Maybe God wants us to get rich as hell
off of this shit.

05:58.324 --> 06:00.519
Well, that certainly would
be nice, wouldn't it?

06:00.693 --> 06:03.594
Fuck yeah, it would be nice.
I will be generous with my wealth.

06:03.763 --> 06:06.425
I will help out, obviously,
with things around here.

06:06.599 --> 06:09.363
I'll pay for those extra channels
that I've subscribed to...

06:09.535 --> 06:13.631
...on the satellite thing.
I will also help out with the boys.

06:13.806 --> 06:16.070
Maybe open up a
checking account in their names...

06:16.242 --> 06:18.904
...that I could have access to.
You know, just to...

06:19.078 --> 06:21.478
...drop monies into, make contributions.

06:21.647 --> 06:25.981
Maybe even open up a credit card
in their names and my names.

06:26.152 --> 06:29.349
I don't think we're gonna
open a credit-card account for you...

06:29.522 --> 06:30.750
...in my children's names.

06:31.390 --> 06:34.791
Okay, well, let's- We should
do the checking-account thing though.

06:34.961 --> 06:37.429
Let's start listing the first stuff.

06:39.866 --> 06:42.061
I've been blessed with many things
in this life:

06:42.235 --> 06:44.931
an arm like a damn rocket,
a cock like a Burmese python...

06:45.104 --> 06:46.969
...and the mind of a fucking scientist.

06:47.139 --> 06:51.007
So people often ask me, "Kenny, what are
your weaknesses? Do you have any?"

06:51.177 --> 06:53.611
I would say that my biggest flaw,
my Achilles heel...

06:53.779 --> 06:56.714
...is my tireless work ethic.
People say Kenny is a woman hater.

06:56.883 --> 06:58.748
That's not true. I love women.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.386
Every fucking one of them,
even the ugly-as-shit ones.

07:01.554 --> 07:05.251
But don't ask me to trust them,
even nuns, because every pair of tits...

07:05.424 --> 07:08.120
...comes with a gaping hole in need
even Kenny can't fill.

07:08.294 --> 07:10.524
I never bought into
native American mythology.

07:10.696 --> 07:12.926
You can smoke a pipe
till your dick falls off...

07:13.099 --> 07:15.863
...and I'm not dancing with wolves
no matter how high I get.

07:16.035 --> 07:20.563
Not that I get high, but if I did,
my shit would still believe in Jesus Christ.

07:20.740 --> 07:23.504
One thing I hate, it's losing.
If there's two things...

07:23.676 --> 07:26.144
...it's losing and getting cancelled.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.594
- What are you looking at?
- Your nice hair, asshole.

07:45.765 --> 07:48.757
Yeah, nice job making 3 bucks a week,
you dipshit.

07:48.935 --> 07:51.733
Sell weed to make more money.

08:12.024 --> 08:15.016
Here's what I need you to do.
Call Kevin Nakashi in Seattle.

08:15.194 --> 08:17.458
He runs Happy Farms,
an organic beef distributor.

08:17.630 --> 08:20.155
- I don't have his number. Find that too.
- Okay, got it.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.632
Have him make shipments
of the Kobe beef to Louis.

08:23.803 --> 08:25.998
It's gonna cost more,
but if you drop my name...

08:26.172 --> 08:28.333
-... you should get a discount.
- Okay, cool.

08:28.507 --> 08:30.372
Hey, has the petty cash
come through yet?

08:30.543 --> 08:33.409
I'm still waiting on a check,
so I need you to keep floating.

08:33.578 --> 08:35.171
- Okay, I-
- But save your receipts.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.407
- I will reimburse you.
- Very cool, very cool.

08:37.582 --> 08:38.674
Finally...

08:38.851 --> 08:41.046
...I need you to find out
who Pliny Caldwell is.

08:41.220 --> 08:42.244
Pliny Caldwell?

08:42.421 --> 08:44.616
Yeah, he's some hotshot pitcher
trying to be me.

08:44.790 --> 08:46.621
Trying to bite the Powers
fucking style.

08:46.792 --> 08:49.852
I wanna know when he plays.
See what this imposter's working with.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.156
- But he's in high school.
- So what?

08:52.331 --> 08:55.027
He wants in the big game, and so do I.
He's my competition.

08:55.201 --> 09:00.571
- A casualty of my fucking war.
- Hey. Consider it done.

09:15.254 --> 09:17.779
Are you ready to learn
some next-level shit?

09:17.957 --> 09:20.619
- Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

09:20.793 --> 09:24.058
From this moment on,
you guys are no longer little kids.

09:24.797 --> 09:27.322
You're cold, calculated murderers.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.958
This is the mindset you gotta be in
if you wanna be a champion.

09:31.137 --> 09:32.399
You got me?

09:32.571 --> 09:34.562
Cutty, what do you need, bro?

09:34.740 --> 09:37.368
Oh, no, I'm just observing the class.
Carry on, please...

09:37.543 --> 09:39.875
...because I am awfully intrigued.

09:40.846 --> 09:43.781
Class, do we want
the principal of the school...

09:43.949 --> 09:46.179
...in our secret meeting of learning?

09:46.952 --> 09:48.385
Hell, no!

09:50.289 --> 09:52.621
Well, it's really not up
to any of you guys.

09:52.792 --> 09:55.352
It's just part of my-
I have to observe my teachers.

09:55.528 --> 09:58.019
The people have spoken, Cut.
Hit the halls, baby.

09:58.197 --> 10:00.757
Okay, let's just try and clean up
some of our language.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.332
And I'll just stand over here.

10:02.501 --> 10:04.969
That's fine with me.
- That would be great for me.

10:05.137 --> 10:08.573
I'll tell you, most teachers don't have
a problem with me observing, but-

10:08.741 --> 10:12.302
Well, you're about to find out that I
ain't like most of these damn teachers.

10:12.478 --> 10:13.672
Okay.

10:14.714 --> 10:17.080
How's that?
Am I out of your peripheral?

10:17.249 --> 10:20.480
Anyway, so besides getting shot
in the back of the head...

10:20.653 --> 10:23.121
...do you know what else
Abraham Lincoln did?

10:23.289 --> 10:28.625
He was a champion wrestler in high school,
and I'm not making that up.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.262
You know what?
Could you go back behind the door...

10:31.430 --> 10:35.389
...because I was on a good run
and now I've just lost it.

10:35.568 --> 10:38.332
- You want me out in the hallway?
- That would be fantastic.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.008
Behave yourselves.

10:43.175 --> 10:46.542
Don't try to tell my warriors what to do.

10:49.014 --> 10:51.744
All right, fuck him.
So here we go, guys.

10:51.917 --> 10:54.943
Name of the game, kids: Thunderdome.

10:55.121 --> 10:59.217
Two men enter, one man leaves.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.254
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

11:03.429 --> 11:05.021
Yeah. Yeah!

11:05.197 --> 11:06.255
Get up!

11:06.432 --> 11:10.801
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

11:14.006 --> 11:18.602
Dude, I'm so sorry about splitting
with your truck the other night, man.

11:18.778 --> 11:21.975
I was drunk.
I had a chance to get laid.

11:22.148 --> 11:25.117
- My hands were tied, man.
- I understand.

11:25.284 --> 11:27.514
I'd probably have done
the same thing.

11:38.430 --> 11:40.057
We're square on the truck...

11:40.232 --> 11:41.995
...but I need you
to do something else.

11:42.168 --> 11:45.296
- And you can't fuck this up.
- Whatever you want, Kenny.

11:45.471 --> 11:47.735
I need you to score me some juice.

11:47.907 --> 11:50.273
- You mean, like, from the store?
- No, motherfucker.

11:50.442 --> 11:53.673
I'm talking 'roids. Don't act
like you don't know about drugs.

11:53.846 --> 11:57.976
- I don't know anybody that sells steroids.
- That black dude that had all that Cialis?

11:58.150 --> 11:59.742
- Marcus?
- Yeah.

11:59.919 --> 12:04.822
Yeah, maybe, but,
and I'm not trying to be a dick here...

12:04.990 --> 12:08.050
...but how's taking steroids
gonna get you back in the big leagues?

12:08.227 --> 12:11.196
I mean, I thought they tested
pretty hardcore for that shit.

12:11.363 --> 12:14.355
Obviously, I'm not gonna need steroids
once I'm fucking in shape.

12:14.533 --> 12:17.195
This is just to kick-start
the training, dude.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.304
I'll see what I can do.

12:20.472 --> 12:24.101
I want my monies.
Show me them monies.

12:24.276 --> 12:26.870
Put it up Dustin's butts.

12:27.046 --> 12:30.573
- What all you got up there so far?
- Well, just a few things.

12:30.749 --> 12:32.148
Here, let me pull one up.

12:33.886 --> 12:35.478
Five thousand dollars?

12:36.555 --> 12:39.991
Did the damn zero key get stuck, honey?
Good Lord.

12:40.159 --> 12:42.059
No, Dustin, the zero key
didn't get stuck.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.696
- I don't know what the fuck is so funny.
- Well, just-

12:44.864 --> 12:46.331
Kenny...

12:46.498 --> 12:49.160
...who do you think is gonna pay 5 grand
for a broken bat?

12:49.335 --> 12:52.463
A lot of people, Dustin. That's the bat
I hit my only home run with.

12:52.638 --> 12:55.937
I don't know why you're being a bitch.
I'm trying to make my life better.

12:56.108 --> 12:59.976
Okay, you know what, Kenny,
rather than asking for the top price...

13:00.145 --> 13:03.672
...maybe we should use the bids
to, like, drive the price up.

13:05.584 --> 13:07.552
I don't know what that means, Cassie.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.551
Well, we will lower the asking price...

13:09.722 --> 13:13.180
...and then people will compete
for the items, thus driving the price up.

13:13.359 --> 13:16.260
So let me get this straight.
You want me to lower the prices-

13:16.428 --> 13:19.420
Basically give shit away.
- so people can just go for the- For-

13:19.598 --> 13:22.226
Get it for the price that was higher?

13:24.470 --> 13:26.461
If that's what you think.
You're the expert.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.403
- I've never done this eBay shit.
- I know.

13:29.575 --> 13:31.975
All right, fine.
We'll lower the price of the bat...

13:32.144 --> 13:34.009
...but I'm not gonna budge
on the pillow.

13:34.179 --> 13:36.647
Anyone who wouldn't pay that price
is a fucking idiot.

13:36.815 --> 13:39.249
It's a goddamn steal.

13:40.119 --> 13:42.110
All right, cool dudes.

13:42.288 --> 13:43.482
Behold, gentleman.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.887
I offer you a once in a lifetime
investment opportunity.

13:47.059 --> 13:50.028
Each of these balls were thrown
by this fucking hand...

13:50.195 --> 13:53.528
...in the goddamn World Series.
I've autographed each of them.

13:53.699 --> 13:56.190
I'll even throw in the Halliburton case.

13:56.368 --> 13:59.132
- What do you say? One thousand dollars.
- A thousand dollars?

13:59.305 --> 14:01.205
The whole goddamn thing,
a thousand bucks.

14:01.373 --> 14:05.275
Come on. I don't have that kind of money.
Just sell me one ball. That's all I need.

14:05.444 --> 14:07.173
I can't sell one. It's part of a set.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.746
You gotta buy them all.
It's all balls or no balls.

14:09.915 --> 14:12.179
Dude, it ain't happening, man. Come on.

14:12.351 --> 14:15.809
- I thought you said he was serious, man.
- Chaz, you need to get to class.

14:15.988 --> 14:17.285
Kenny, what is this?

14:17.456 --> 14:19.549
You messing around
with black-market shit now?

14:19.725 --> 14:22.558
No, not black-market shit,
just regular-market shit.

14:22.728 --> 14:25.288
What? You guys can sell tickets
to a cancer-kid dance...

14:25.464 --> 14:27.295
...I can't sell shit for my own things?

14:27.466 --> 14:30.026
On school grounds,
I'm sure there's a rule against that.

14:30.202 --> 14:33.171
Oh, what are you gonna do?
Tell your boyfriend about it?

14:33.339 --> 14:36.775
- So, what is this stuff anyway?
- Oh, change the subject.

14:36.942 --> 14:40.605
I can roll with that. Well, April,
since you're so concerned...

14:40.779 --> 14:45.273
...these are the priceless heirlooms
from my reign as king of the ball field.

14:45.451 --> 14:48.978
- All for sale.
- How much is that mask?

14:49.154 --> 14:51.247
This one right here?

14:51.724 --> 14:55.421
Funny you ask.
You obviously have an eye for quality.

14:55.861 --> 14:57.726
This mask is valued at over 600 bucks...

14:57.896 --> 15:00.922
...but I'll be willing to give it to you
for four hundy.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.432
- Can I try it on?
- Yes, you may.

15:04.770 --> 15:05.794
Put it on.

15:06.438 --> 15:09.635
- See, you're being rough with the hat.
- I'm just trying to put it on.

15:09.808 --> 15:12.834
Well, you're almost messing it up.
Look at that, huh?

15:13.012 --> 15:15.207
- As handsome as me.
- Fuck you, I'm Kenny Powers.

15:15.381 --> 15:17.372
- You bet your ass you are.
- You know it.

15:17.549 --> 15:19.744
- Now, that, that's how you do?
- That's how I do.

15:19.918 --> 15:24.082
You know, if I took you from behind
right now, I'd be fucking myself over.

15:24.256 --> 15:28.158
You look like a retarded Michael Myers.
It's not a good look.

15:31.797 --> 15:33.526
What do you say? We got a deal?

15:33.699 --> 15:35.792
I can't pay 400 bucks for that shit.

15:37.236 --> 15:38.498
You can't or you won't?

15:39.872 --> 15:42.340
- I won't.
- I know why you won't.

15:42.508 --> 15:44.840
- Why?
- Because you hate me.

15:47.046 --> 15:49.037
Don't be late for school.

15:51.183 --> 15:53.481
Don't tell me what to do.

15:54.853 --> 15:56.980
Clearance sale.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.185
Stevie, this better be good.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.955
I'm in the middle of some
intense goddamn training.

17:13.132 --> 17:16.589
Oh, it's good, Kenny.
I found the boy pitcher.

17:16.768 --> 17:20.499
- Caldwell.
- Oh, for real?

17:20.672 --> 17:23.936
Man, I am so excited,
I can't wait to see you to-

17:30.115 --> 17:32.083
Strike three! You're out!

17:32.885 --> 17:35.080
A perfect pitch.

17:35.254 --> 17:36.721
He threw a perfect pitch?

17:36.889 --> 17:40.256
Well, technically, yes,
but dude's got dick for style.

17:40.425 --> 17:42.950
He's got no showmanship,
no personal pizzazz.

17:43.128 --> 17:45.722
It's like watching a fucking
pitching machine.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.493
- Fuck this kid.
- Totally. Fuck him.

17:49.668 --> 17:52.569
I knew we were wasting our time
coming down here, Kenny.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.796
Stevie, first of all...

17:53.972 --> 17:57.100
...don't ever fucking second-guess
me, all right? Rule number one.

17:57.276 --> 17:58.300
Kenny Powers?

17:59.144 --> 18:02.079
- It is you, man. How you doing?
- Who's asking?

18:02.247 --> 18:06.809
I'm Allan Hicks. I'm a college recruit
from UNCW, man.

18:06.985 --> 18:08.316
I know you don't remember me.

18:08.487 --> 18:11.718
I watched you whip the cracks
off of Wilkes Central's butts...

18:11.890 --> 18:13.414
...when you was a sophomore, man.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.856
That's some of the best pitching
I have ever seen.

18:16.028 --> 18:18.861
- You had a lot of talent back then.
- Hey, he still does.

18:19.031 --> 18:22.091
Yeah, I'm pretty much
re-engineering man's approach to pitching...

18:22.267 --> 18:25.361
-... if you wanna get down to brass tacks.
- Well, that's impressive.

18:25.537 --> 18:30.133
They said you was around,
but teaching school or something?

18:30.309 --> 18:33.437
I'd focus on the "something" aspect of that.
Yeah, I'm teaching.

18:33.612 --> 18:36.911
That's out of the kindness of my heart.
The real deal is the training.

18:37.082 --> 18:40.415
- You're training again?
- You bet your ass. Morning, noon and night.

18:40.586 --> 18:43.521
I'm two days away from being
in the best condition of my life.

18:43.689 --> 18:46.715
Well, that's good
for you then there, Kenny.

18:46.892 --> 18:49.986
I always thought it was a shame
how things turned out for you.

18:50.162 --> 18:52.460
Didn't turn out too bad.
You know, I'm sober now.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.566
It's crazy what two years sober will do.
Living totally clean.

18:55.734 --> 18:57.827
Honest, just straight.

18:58.003 --> 19:00.563
Kind of makes you see
what's really important, don't it?

19:00.739 --> 19:03.037
- It does. Most definitely.
- Yep.

19:03.208 --> 19:05.176
Word is
Kenny Powers is coming back.

19:05.344 --> 19:07.869
- Good luck, yeah.
- Help me out.

19:08.814 --> 19:09.906
With what?

19:10.082 --> 19:11.982
With your connects, motherfucker,
come on.

19:12.150 --> 19:15.119
Oh, Kenny, I'm a college scout.
I can't-

19:15.287 --> 19:16.777
Come on, man. You know people.

19:16.955 --> 19:18.786
No, I-

19:18.957 --> 19:20.948
I don't know that many folks that-

19:21.126 --> 19:23.788
No, I'm just not the guy to help you.
Wish I could though.

19:23.962 --> 19:27.625
But you'll help this
fucking needle-dick Caldwell.

19:28.333 --> 19:31.461
I don't know if I appreciate
how this conversation's turning, son.

19:31.637 --> 19:34.105
- You don't got a clue, bro.
- No, I got the clue.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.468
Let me go back up
and do what I came here to do.

19:36.642 --> 19:39.634
Oh, and what's that? Looking at a bunch
of boys throwing balls...

19:39.811 --> 19:42.746
...instead of getting onboard my shit
and seeing real talent?

19:42.914 --> 19:45.007
Watching high school kids
is my business, son.

19:45.183 --> 19:47.083
Oh, well, that's fucking terrific.

19:47.252 --> 19:50.244
My business is being a goddamn
powerhouse and making millions.

19:50.422 --> 19:53.357
I hate to break this to you,
you arrogant piece of shit.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.425
The big leagues
never would take you back.

19:55.594 --> 19:58.256
You're too old, you're too fat
and you're too damn stupid.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.694
That's not true.
I don't give a fuck what you say.

20:00.866 --> 20:04.199
I'm coming back whether
the big leagues want me or not.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.836
It was real nice meeting you, Kenny.
Watch it, prick.

20:09.007 --> 20:11.567
Watch it, ass blood.

20:25.824 --> 20:28.156
Cassie, get up.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.620
Cassandra, get up.

20:32.164 --> 20:34.530
Cassandra!

20:36.034 --> 20:37.865
Oh, my God. Kenny, what is it?

20:38.036 --> 20:41.062
There's an emergency. I need
to see you in the computer room now.

20:41.239 --> 20:43.935
Jesus, Kenny. It's the middle
of the damn night.

20:44.109 --> 20:45.508
Now, Cassie.

20:45.677 --> 20:46.939
- Kenny-
- Okay.

20:47.112 --> 20:49.603
- Don't go with him.
- It's okay, it's okay.

20:49.781 --> 20:51.681
Come on.

20:52.951 --> 20:55.351
Go back to sleep, Dustin.

20:56.655 --> 20:58.350
Don't go, baby.

20:58.523 --> 21:04.826
You butt-fucked me, Cassie.
Out of $4993.

21:05.664 --> 21:08.189
What are you talking about, Kenny?

21:08.367 --> 21:10.358
The Internet.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.906
Okay. Well, that's good.
You sold your bat.

21:17.809 --> 21:21.006
- Congratulations, sweetheart.
- Congratulations, my ass.

21:23.281 --> 21:26.717
Okay, you need to calm down
and tell me what's going on.

21:26.885 --> 21:28.910
You wanna know what's going on?

21:29.921 --> 21:33.652
This bat we sold?
This bat is my home-run bat.

21:33.825 --> 21:36.521
Do you know how many pitchers
hit home runs in the majors?

21:36.695 --> 21:40.392
Practically almost zero, but I did it.

21:40.565 --> 21:45.059
Now with your help, I sold it
for 7 fucking bucks to some asshole.

21:45.237 --> 21:49.196
So you're upset that your bat
sold for 7 bucks.

21:49.374 --> 21:52.002
It's not just the bat, Cassie.

21:52.177 --> 21:54.236
Why doesn't anybody want this shit?

21:56.381 --> 21:59.612
Kenny, let's be honest here, okay?

21:59.785 --> 22:03.016
It's been a while
since you've been on top.

22:03.188 --> 22:06.021
Doesn't mean that you've been forgotten
or weren't any good.

22:06.191 --> 22:09.456
And it's not an insult
to the talent that you had...

22:09.628 --> 22:12.529
...but time changes
people's memory sometimes...

22:12.697 --> 22:14.460
...for good and bad.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.000
Well, fuck time.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.969
I know my past is more valuable
than 7 bucks.

22:22.140 --> 22:26.133
Yeah, sure, your past is valuable,
because it made you who you are today...

22:26.311 --> 22:28.711
...but you need to start thinking
about your future.

22:29.314 --> 22:30.975
Okay?

22:31.716 --> 22:35.208
I just so happen
to see more in you, Kenny.

22:37.422 --> 22:41.119
What do we do with all this awesome,
unwanted Kenny Powers shit?

22:41.293 --> 22:45.252
Well, I can think of two people
in this household who'd certainly love it.

22:48.266 --> 22:51.895
One thing each, boys.
Wayne, one thing, not two.

22:52.070 --> 22:54.129
Ask anybody out there...

22:54.306 --> 22:57.366
...and they'll tell you that the foundation
of a baseball player...

22:57.542 --> 23:00.909
...starts with an understanding
of some basic fundamentals.

23:01.079 --> 23:02.706
Any one thing. Choose wisely.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.611
Running, stretching,
physical conditioning.

23:05.784 --> 23:09.276
I'd get maybe one of them
Kenny Powers condoms...

23:09.454 --> 23:11.445
...to have for when you're older.

23:11.623 --> 23:14.922
Wayne, you might- There's some
Kenny Powers cookies in there.

23:15.093 --> 23:17.186
These are the things
that prepare your body...

23:17.362 --> 23:20.388
...for the many challenges
a baseball player faces.

23:20.565 --> 23:23.693
I heard that bullshit thrown at me
all my damn life.

23:23.869 --> 23:26.099
You know what Kenny Powers says?

23:26.271 --> 23:28.671
"Fundamentals are the crutch
for the talentless. "

23:28.840 --> 23:31.468
One coach tried to put me
on a weight-training program...

23:31.643 --> 23:34.578
...and I was like, "You and your weights
can fuck off somewhere.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.577
I'm not lifting that shit. It's heavy.

23:36.748 --> 23:39.182
Tell me why I need training
when I'm strong enough...

23:39.351 --> 23:43.913
...to throw a goddamn
100-mile-per-hour pitch. Fuck that. "

23:45.957 --> 23:49.552
See in life, when you have talent,
all the other shit doesn't matter.

23:51.429 --> 23:54.865
If we were on an island
with no weights and no running drills...

23:55.033 --> 23:56.330
...who would be on top then?

23:56.902 --> 23:58.836
The guy with the talent.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.275
Hey, Caldwell.

24:06.444 --> 24:09.277
Kenny Powers says good luck
with your fucking career.

24:09.447 --> 24:12.143
I'm gonna break your arm.

24:12.884 --> 24:14.249
It is, isn't it?

24:14.619 --> 24:16.814
I have a knife! I have a knife!

24:16.988 --> 24:20.424
In a nutshell, you can train all you want.

24:20.825 --> 24:24.352
You can work on your catching,
on your throwing, on your running.

24:24.529 --> 24:27.191
Hell, it might even be enough
to get you into the majors.

24:27.365 --> 24:29.458
Hey, April, I'm gonna hit
the stationary bike.

24:29.634 --> 24:33.365
- Do you need anything?
- No, thanks, sweetie.

24:33.538 --> 24:35.631
I love you, April.

24:36.541 --> 24:38.600
I love you too.

24:44.649 --> 24:50.645
But in order to be a standout,
an all-star, a champion...

24:50.822 --> 24:53.416
...you need more than hard work
and dedication.

24:54.826 --> 24:57.727
You need something
that you can't work for.

24:59.965 --> 25:02.957
You need a blessing from God almighty.
