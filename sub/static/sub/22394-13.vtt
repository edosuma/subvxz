00:05.834 --> 00:09.917
Garsh, I can't believe you
fellers are taking me to potatoland,

00:09.917 --> 00:12.417
the potato-themed amusement park.

00:12.417 --> 00:14.709
I can't believe it either.

00:14.709 --> 00:17.834
It's been my lifelong
dream to visit this place.

00:19.583 --> 00:21.959
Ah, gee, goofy, are you
sure this is the right way?

00:21.959 --> 00:23.750
Sure I'm sure!

00:23.750 --> 00:27.583
Boy, when I was a youngin', we
musta driven past that big potatoland sign

00:27.583 --> 00:30.959
at least, uh, two, seven,
carry the twelve...

00:32.375 --> 00:34.792
Fourteen and a half times!

00:34.792 --> 00:37.125
The sign!
It's the sign!

00:39.125 --> 00:41.291
"Welcome to Idaho."

00:41.291 --> 00:44.125
"America's potato land?"

00:44.125 --> 00:47.583
Potatoland, potatoland...

00:47.583 --> 00:48.917
Uh oh.
Uh oh.

00:48.917 --> 00:51.041
Potato-land!

00:51.041 --> 00:52.917
Potato-land!

00:52.917 --> 00:55.542
Potato, potato, potato...

00:55.542 --> 00:58.041
Goofy, are you sure
this is the right sign?

00:58.041 --> 01:00.792
Heck yeah! Every time we drove past it,

01:00.792 --> 01:04.792
alls I could do is dream about
how great potatoland must be.

01:04.792 --> 01:06.583
So, you've never actually...

01:06.583 --> 01:08.625
Seen potatoland?

01:09.750 --> 01:11.875
I see potatoland every night.

01:11.875 --> 01:14.583
Every night in my dreams.

01:15.417 --> 01:18.500
Potatolaaa...

01:23.458 --> 01:25.000
Well, goodbye.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.166
Donald wait.

01:26.166 --> 01:27.834
Wait for what?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Hey!
I'm sorry, Donald.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.500
But we didn't drive four days
without stopping or eating

01:40.500 --> 01:42.333
to not make goofy's dream come true.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.583
And we're not going
anywhere until it does.

01:45.291 --> 01:46.583
Come true.

01:46.583 --> 01:48.375
And what are we gonna do?

01:48.375 --> 01:51.083
Build an entire amusement park?

01:51.083 --> 01:53.875
In the middle of that potato field?

01:53.875 --> 01:56.583
Donald, that's a great idea.

01:56.834 --> 01:58.834
Me and my big beak.

02:28.250 --> 02:30.166
Potato-land.

02:37.250 --> 02:41.000
Okay, goofy, take a
look. Your lifelong dream...

02:41.000 --> 02:42.834
Come true!
Come true!

02:42.834 --> 02:44.083
Wow.

02:45.417 --> 02:48.750
Uh, goofy. You gotta
take the blindfold off.

02:50.458 --> 02:51.834
Wow!

02:53.500 --> 02:55.375
This is the best dream come true ever!

02:55.375 --> 02:58.417
Well, come on, fellers,
what are we waitin' for?

03:00.250 --> 03:02.667
I just can't believe I'm really here.

03:03.250 --> 03:06.083
It feels so...
Magical!

03:08.041 --> 03:10.083
What do you say we go on a ride?

03:10.083 --> 03:13.041
A ride!
That's a great idea!

03:14.333 --> 03:16.000
Ok, go turn the crank, Donald.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.250
Why do I have to turn the crank?

03:18.583 --> 03:20.959
Do you know how to play the organ?

03:27.959 --> 03:29.291
Faster! Faster!

03:29.917 --> 03:31.875
Faster! Faster!

03:32.750 --> 03:34.333
What did you say?

03:37.041 --> 03:39.625
Donald, this is no time
to be taking a nap.

03:45.959 --> 03:50.458
As the potato creeps toward
the dead oak tree,

03:50.458 --> 03:53.709
potatoes arrive for the midnight spree.

03:55.834 --> 03:57.917
Ah hah hah hah hah.

03:58.667 --> 04:02.667
Oh, gee, I may need a
new set of overalls after this.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.542
Oh, wait.

04:04.542 --> 04:06.667
I'm not wearin' overalls!

04:06.667 --> 04:07.792
Scare away!

04:10.375 --> 04:12.041
Boo.
Ahhh!

04:35.542 --> 04:37.291
Woo! Yeah!

04:44.458 --> 04:46.375
Hey, what's the deal?

04:46.375 --> 04:47.959
Boo!

04:47.959 --> 04:50.333
Hurry up! I'm trying. There's
something wrong with the...

04:50.333 --> 04:52.417
Do I have to do everything myself?

04:59.041 --> 05:02.583
Four score and seven meals ago.

05:02.583 --> 05:06.917
Our fore-taters brought
forth a great gravy.

05:08.166 --> 05:11.542
And new potato conceived in casserole.

05:12.208 --> 05:14.750
And dedicated to the proposition...

05:15.250 --> 05:17.250
Don't worry, Donald.
I found the problem.

05:19.834 --> 05:23.083
That all potatoes are created equal.

05:26.291 --> 05:28.500
Mr. President! Mr. President!

05:28.500 --> 05:31.166
Of all the typical...

05:32.250 --> 05:35.166
D-D-Donald? Is that you?

05:35.166 --> 05:37.125
That's right, goofy.

05:37.125 --> 05:38.959
But, but...

05:38.959 --> 05:40.917
I saluted you.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.250
I'm gonna go see the
park manager about this.

05:44.250 --> 05:45.667
Goofy, wait.
What?

05:45.667 --> 05:49.375
There is no park manager,
because there is no park.

05:49.375 --> 05:51.917
Potatoland isn't real.

05:52.458 --> 05:54.750
What do you mean it's not real?

05:54.750 --> 05:57.542
I mean there's no such
thing as potatoland.

05:57.542 --> 06:00.583
Donald and I stayed up
last night and built all of this.

06:00.917 --> 06:04.458
Now what would you go
and do a thing like that for?

06:04.792 --> 06:06.792
We did it because he...!

06:07.041 --> 06:09.959
Well, because we...

06:09.959 --> 06:12.834
We wanted to make your dream come true.

06:12.834 --> 06:16.834
Well, garsh fellers. Potatoland
might have been a dream,

06:17.458 --> 06:20.417
but our friendship is real.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.083
Now come on.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.125
Let's go get a couple of
hot fudge potato sundaes.

06:25.458 --> 06:26.458
My treat.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.083
What the...?

06:30.792 --> 06:33.083
The midday sun is thinning the gravy.

06:36.291 --> 06:39.875
Guys, I think I just thought
of a new lifelong dream.

06:39.875 --> 06:42.083
What's that, goofy?

06:42.083 --> 06:44.375
To get the heck outta here!

06:46.750 --> 06:48.750
Last one in is a rotten potato.

06:48.750 --> 06:50.458
Hey, wait for me.

06:50.458 --> 06:52.500
Guys, guys, the car won't start! What?

06:52.500 --> 06:54.500
Just kidding.
