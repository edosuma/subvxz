WEBVTT

00:04.510 --> 00:08.093
Captain's log, stardate 5818.4.

00:08.264 --> 00:10.471
A botanical plague
is devastating a planet

00:10.642 --> 00:14.687
in the quadrant of the galaxy where
the Enterprise is operating at present.

00:14.855 --> 00:18.105
It threatens to destroy the vegetation
on the entire planet,

00:18.275 --> 00:20.564
leaving it uninhabitable.

00:20.736 --> 00:23.487
Per Federation orders,
we are proceeding at top warp speed

00:23.654 --> 00:25.197
to the planet Ardana,

00:25.365 --> 00:27.820
where the only known source
of zenite exists.

00:27.992 --> 00:30.946
It is the one substance
that can halt the plague.

00:31.121 --> 00:36.246
Captain, the high adviser of Ardana
is ready to receive you on Stratos, sir.

00:36.418 --> 00:39.335
On Stratos? That's their cloud city,
isn't it, Mr. Spock?

00:39.504 --> 00:41.877
- It is, captain.
- Well, there must be some mistake.

00:42.048 --> 00:45.084
Do you have the coordinates
to the mine entrance available?

00:45.259 --> 00:48.047
They have already been provided
to the transport officer.

00:48.221 --> 00:51.341
Along with those of the council
chamber of the high adviser.

00:52.434 --> 00:55.139
- Kirk to Transporter Room.
- Ready to transport, captain.

00:55.312 --> 00:57.554
Mr. Scott, are you locked in
on the mine entrance

00:57.731 --> 00:59.391
or on their cloud city, Stratos?

00:59.566 --> 01:02.021
The mine entrance.
That's what you ordered, captain.

01:02.193 --> 01:06.570
All right. Uhura, tell the high adviser

01:06.739 --> 01:10.572
that we request to dispense
with the welcoming ceremonies

01:10.744 --> 01:13.579
due to the emergency, that we're
beaming to the mine entrance

01:13.747 --> 01:16.617
in order to ensure the fastest possible
delivery of the zenite.

01:16.792 --> 01:18.250
- The need is urgent.
- Aye, sir.

01:18.418 --> 01:20.743
Mr. Spock, come with me.

01:20.920 --> 01:23.043
Oh, and tell them
that we appreciate the honour

01:23.214 --> 01:25.622
and that we look forward
to some visit in the future.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.425
Aye, sir.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:49.449 --> 01:53.778
Stratos, captain,
a city actually floating in the sky.

01:53.954 --> 01:56.112
Looks as tranquil
as its reputation, doesn't it?

01:56.289 --> 01:59.125
It is one of the most interesting
metropolises in the galaxy.

01:59.293 --> 02:00.952
Have you ever visited here, captain?

02:01.127 --> 02:03.452
Once. I didn't have time
to look around.

02:03.629 --> 02:05.124
I've never had the opportunity.

02:05.298 --> 02:07.421
However, I hear its art forms
are incomparable.

02:07.592 --> 02:09.798
Yes, art is the population's
chief occupation.

02:09.969 --> 02:13.136
It is a totally intellectual society.

02:13.306 --> 02:15.928
All forms of violence
have been eliminated.

02:16.101 --> 02:17.381
There's the mine entrance.

02:17.561 --> 02:20.015
The zenite consignment
should have been there.

02:31.950 --> 02:34.026
I don't understand.
Those Troglyte miners

02:34.202 --> 02:37.406
were supposed to have made
delivery when we beamed down.

02:37.581 --> 02:40.497
Perhaps there is
another entrance, captain.

02:49.134 --> 02:53.262
It would seem the Troglytes have
changed their minds about delivery.

03:09.321 --> 03:12.855
Space, the final frontier.

03:18.287 --> 03:22.416
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

03:22.583 --> 03:26.533
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

03:26.713 --> 03:30.545
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

03:30.717 --> 03:34.217
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

04:16.803 --> 04:19.011
Who are you?
What's the meaning of this attack?

04:19.182 --> 04:21.720
Interference breeds attack, captain.
Come on.

04:21.892 --> 04:24.894
We're here by permission of your
government on an emergency mission.

04:25.063 --> 04:27.471
Move on, captain.

05:18.116 --> 05:20.025
Troglytes, halt!

05:23.538 --> 05:24.866
Surrender or we'll fire!

05:40.513 --> 05:43.550
- Are you harmed, gentlemen?
- No, just a little shaken up.

05:43.725 --> 05:46.298
I am Plasus,
high advisor of the planet council.

05:46.478 --> 05:48.933
Captain Kirk, Enterprise.
My first officer, Mr. Spock.

05:49.105 --> 05:51.893
- Greetings, Mr. Advisor.
- My regrets for the unpleasantness

05:52.067 --> 05:54.557
- of your welcome to Ardana.
- It was rather warm.

05:54.735 --> 05:58.270
Unfortunately, violence is habitual
with the Troglytes.

05:58.448 --> 06:01.614
But I assure you,
this insult will not go unpunished.

06:01.784 --> 06:04.073
I'm more concerned
with the zenite consignment.

06:04.245 --> 06:06.072
Why wasn't it
in its specified location?

06:06.247 --> 06:09.581
Apparently the Disrupters have
confiscated it, as I knew they would.

06:09.751 --> 06:12.537
The Disruptors? Who are they?

06:12.712 --> 06:15.037
A small group
of Troglyte malcontents.

06:15.214 --> 06:18.002
All the other Troglytes
are completely dominated by them.

06:18.176 --> 06:19.551
The Disruptors are responsible

06:19.719 --> 06:21.925
for their refusal
to continue mining for zenite.

06:22.096 --> 06:24.552
They agreed to the delivery.
Your council assured us.

06:24.724 --> 06:28.390
They agreed, obviously,
as a ruse to get valuable hostages.

06:28.562 --> 06:31.230
Hostages? For what purpose?

06:31.397 --> 06:33.603
To force the council
to meet their demands.

06:35.318 --> 06:39.647
Organise a search party immediately
and find the zenite consignment.

06:39.822 --> 06:41.732
Meanwhile, captain,

06:41.908 --> 06:44.862
I would suggest that you
and First Officer Spock

06:45.036 --> 06:46.863
be our guests on Stratos.

06:47.038 --> 06:51.616
Very well. I do hope the search
will be brief, Mr. Advisor.

06:51.792 --> 06:55.624
We'll do everything possible
to make it so. Come, gentlemen.

07:07.309 --> 07:08.803
Remarkable.

07:11.604 --> 07:15.816
The finest example of sustained
anti-gravity elevation I've ever seen.

07:31.958 --> 07:34.365
The sentinel told me
of our honoured guests, Father.

07:34.544 --> 07:37.414
- I came to extend greetings.
- A most gracious act.

07:37.964 --> 07:41.131
Gentlemen, one of our planet's
most incomparable works of art.

07:41.301 --> 07:44.171
My daughter Droxine.
Captain James Kirk.

07:44.346 --> 07:47.097
- A pleasure, madam.
- Indeed, yes, captain.

07:47.265 --> 07:49.672
And First Officer Spock.

07:52.395 --> 07:55.147
I have never before met a Vulcan, sir.

07:55.982 --> 07:58.354
Nor I a work of art, madam.

07:59.819 --> 08:02.191
Come, gentlemen,
there is much to see in our city.

08:02.363 --> 08:06.860
This is our council gallery.
It is open to all city dwellers.

08:07.035 --> 08:11.495
We have some of the finest of our
various art forms assembled here

08:11.664 --> 08:13.989
for the viewing
and contemplation of every...

08:17.337 --> 08:19.128
- Disruptors again!
- How dreadful.

08:19.297 --> 08:21.171
They're despoiling the whole city.

08:21.341 --> 08:24.211
Despoil? For what purpose?

08:24.386 --> 08:26.628
By keeping us in constant turmoil,

08:26.805 --> 08:29.509
they hope to force the council
to accede to their demands.

08:29.682 --> 08:32.173
- What are their demands?
- Completely unreasonable.

08:32.351 --> 08:35.352
- Nothing you need be concerned with.
- I must concern myself with it

08:35.520 --> 08:38.191
if it should interfere with the delivery
of zenite to Merak II.

08:38.357 --> 08:43.020
Mr. Advisor, the plant life is the source
of oxygen on that planet.

08:43.196 --> 08:47.691
Obviously, if all plant life is destroyed,
the humanoid life will follow.

08:47.867 --> 08:51.034
I assure you, gentlemen,
you will get what you came for.

08:51.203 --> 08:54.205
I hope so.
Ardana is a member of the Federation.

08:54.373 --> 08:57.291
And it is your council's responsibility
that nothing interferes

08:57.460 --> 09:00.212
with its obligation
to another member of the Federation.

09:00.380 --> 09:02.373
Of course,
and we accept the responsibility.

09:02.549 --> 09:07.210
But why do they destroy art forms?
That is a loss to everyone.

09:07.386 --> 09:12.725
Art means nothing to the Disruptors.
This is the only form they understand.

09:12.892 --> 09:17.221
The disturbances accompanying
your arrival have been most wearying.

09:17.397 --> 09:19.021
No doubt you would like to rest.

09:19.190 --> 09:21.397
That would be most welcome,
Mr. Advisor.

09:21.568 --> 09:23.525
Chambers have been
prepared for you.

09:23.695 --> 09:26.363
A sentinel will guide you to them.

09:36.124 --> 09:40.916
I'm sorry they were so poorly treated
on their first visit to our planet.

09:41.087 --> 09:43.709
It's fortunate
they were not seriously hurt.

09:43.882 --> 09:45.874
Oh, yeas,
that would have been dreadful.

09:46.050 --> 09:50.048
Further violence
could create grave difficulties

09:50.221 --> 09:52.794
between Ardana and the Federation.

09:52.974 --> 09:58.051
The Disruptors must be mad to attack
two such charming strangers.

09:58.229 --> 10:01.266
They grow more daring
and determined every day.

10:01.441 --> 10:05.023
Now they seek
to find allies in the galaxy.

10:05.194 --> 10:10.152
Do you think that Captain Kirk
and his very attractive officer

10:10.324 --> 10:13.444
will feel that we're responsible
for their injuries?

10:13.619 --> 10:17.452
All this time I thought you were worried
about our diplomatic relations.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.206
Apologies, Mr. Advisor.

10:22.379 --> 10:24.501
This Troglyte was apprehended
leaving the city.

10:24.672 --> 10:27.459
He is without a transport card,
so we thought you would want

10:27.633 --> 10:30.634
- to question him.
- Remove his shields.

10:31.637 --> 10:33.963
What is your business
in Stratos, Troglyte?

10:40.313 --> 10:44.476
- Speak! I command you.
- My business is to repair.

10:44.650 --> 10:48.814
- Repair what?
- There are damaged entrance panels.

10:48.988 --> 10:52.820
Indeed. Then you must have
a repair permit. Where is it?

10:54.160 --> 10:56.200
- It was forgotten.
- Did you also forget

10:56.371 --> 10:58.660
your transport card?

10:59.666 --> 11:01.705
It was lost
when your sentinels attacked me.

11:01.876 --> 11:04.164
And where was
your cavern implement lost?

11:06.672 --> 11:11.465
- Could this perhaps be it?
- I came to make repairs.

11:11.636 --> 11:15.468
You shall make them, by giving us
the names of the Disruptors.

11:16.182 --> 11:17.807
I know nothing.

11:17.976 --> 11:20.681
I would advise you to
increase your knowledge.

11:20.854 --> 11:23.605
That is not possible for a Troglyte.

11:23.772 --> 11:26.809
The Stratos city dwellers have said it.

11:28.194 --> 11:30.021
Secure him to the rostrum.

11:39.039 --> 11:41.493
How unfortunate.

11:42.124 --> 11:44.247
How unfortunate.

11:52.051 --> 11:55.919
This troubled planet is a place
of the most violent contrasts.

11:56.097 --> 11:59.300
Those who receive the rewards
are totally separated

11:59.476 --> 12:01.847
from those
who shoulder the burdens.

12:02.019 --> 12:04.641
It is not a wise leadership.

12:04.939 --> 12:09.186
Here on Stratos, everything is
incomparably beautiful and pleasant.

12:09.360 --> 12:12.112
The high advisor's
charming daughter, Droxine,

12:12.280 --> 12:14.403
particularly so.

12:14.574 --> 12:18.157
The name Droxine
seems appropriate for her.

12:18.328 --> 12:23.618
I wonder, can she retain such purity
and sweetness of mind

12:23.791 --> 12:28.500
and be aware of the life of the people
on the surface of the planet?

12:28.754 --> 12:32.088
There, the harsh life in the mines

12:32.258 --> 12:35.212
is instilling the people
with a bitter hatred.

12:35.386 --> 12:39.135
The young girl who led the attack
against us when we beamed down

12:39.306 --> 12:42.925
was filled with the violence
of desperation.

12:43.811 --> 12:48.806
If the lovely Droxine
knew of the young miners' misery,

12:48.983 --> 12:52.020
I wonder how the knowledge
would affect her.

13:24.935 --> 13:26.181
Mr. Spock,

13:26.354 --> 13:29.474
I thought you had accompanied
Captain Kirk to the rest chamber.

13:29.649 --> 13:32.852
- Your movements awakened me.
- My apologies.

13:33.027 --> 13:35.316
I did not realise
they would disturb you.

13:35.488 --> 13:38.524
Only Vulcan ears
would find the noise discernible.

13:40.451 --> 13:44.401
It seems that Vulcans
are fascinatingly different,

13:44.580 --> 13:46.703
in many ways.

13:47.333 --> 13:49.871
The same may be said
of Stratos' inhabitants.

13:54.674 --> 13:58.042
Vulcan eyes are very discerning too.

14:02.848 --> 14:06.015
I hear that, intellectually,

14:06.185 --> 14:09.352
Vulcans are as highly evolved

14:09.522 --> 14:12.689
as Stratos city dwellers.

14:14.944 --> 14:20.649
We do pride ourselves on our logic.

15:10.541 --> 15:12.202
You again!

15:15.045 --> 15:17.417
You sleep lightly, captain.

15:17.590 --> 15:21.006
Yes, duty is a good teacher.

15:21.177 --> 15:23.584
I see you've changed
your dressmaker.

15:23.763 --> 15:25.720
Release me.

15:25.890 --> 15:28.761
So you can attack me again?
That would be foolish.

15:29.936 --> 15:33.352
Call the guards
if you're afraid, captain.

15:34.606 --> 15:36.149
I'm not afraid.

15:36.317 --> 15:40.267
In fact, I find this rather enjoyable.

15:40.946 --> 15:43.272
I do not!

15:43.449 --> 15:46.284
All right, I'll make a deal with you.

15:46.953 --> 15:50.951
You answer some questions
and I'll let you up.

15:55.294 --> 15:57.452
What questions?

15:58.130 --> 16:00.419
Your word first.

16:03.511 --> 16:05.753
I will answer.

16:20.444 --> 16:25.272
You only take a mate
once every seven years?

16:25.491 --> 16:27.899
The seven-year cycle

16:28.286 --> 16:31.950
is biologically inherent in all Vulcans.

16:32.164 --> 16:37.503
At that time, the mating drive
outweighs all other motivations.

16:51.350 --> 16:55.727
And is there nothing
that can disturb that cycle,

16:55.896 --> 16:57.853
Mr. Spock?

17:00.735 --> 17:03.652
Extreme feminine beauty...

17:04.906 --> 17:07.194
...is always...

17:08.534 --> 17:12.032
...disturbing, madam.

17:12.204 --> 17:13.531
Spock?

17:14.415 --> 17:16.324
I did not come here
to kill you, captain.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.531
Then why this?

17:17.710 --> 17:19.999
To take you hostage.

17:23.382 --> 17:25.955
Am I intruding, captain?

17:26.135 --> 17:28.211
- Vanna.
- Droxine.

17:28.387 --> 17:29.882
Why have you come here?

17:30.055 --> 17:31.633
To welcome our honoured guests

17:31.807 --> 17:35.425
as I was taught to do when I served
in your father's household.

17:35.936 --> 17:38.095
- Has she injured you, captain?
- No, not at all.

17:38.272 --> 17:41.024
In fact, her visit
was quite enlightening.

17:41.192 --> 17:42.223
- Oh?
- Yes,

17:42.401 --> 17:44.311
it seems the Troglytes
are under the impression

17:44.487 --> 17:47.025
that the Enterprise
is here to intimidate them.

17:48.741 --> 17:51.029
Send a sentinel
to the rest chamber immediately.

17:51.869 --> 17:54.276
It is not impression, captain.
It is the truth.

17:54.455 --> 17:56.910
We're here to get zenite consignment
and that's it.

17:57.416 --> 18:00.583
Starships do not transport cargo.

18:00.753 --> 18:02.331
In times of emergency,
they do anything.

18:02.505 --> 18:04.913
And believe me, this botanical plague
is an emergency.

18:05.091 --> 18:07.416
Lies will not keep the Troglytes
in the caverns

18:07.594 --> 18:09.550
and neither will your starship.

18:09.720 --> 18:12.756
You talk like a Disruptor, Vanna.

18:12.931 --> 18:14.971
I speak for my people.

18:15.142 --> 18:18.392
They have as much right to the clouds
as the Stratos dwellers.

18:18.562 --> 18:22.856
The Stratos is for advisors
and studiers.

18:23.025 --> 18:25.148
What would Troglytes do here?

18:25.319 --> 18:31.274
Live. In the sunlight and warmth,
as everyone should.

18:31.450 --> 18:36.278
The caverns are warm and your eyes
are not accustomed to light.

18:37.164 --> 18:40.664
Just as your minds
are not accustomed to logic.

18:48.467 --> 18:51.670
Unaccustomed to light and warmth?

18:51.845 --> 18:53.672
That's necessary to all humanoids.

18:53.847 --> 18:56.089
Surely you don't deny it
to the Troglytes.

18:56.267 --> 19:01.095
The Troglytes are workers, captain.
Surely you must be aware of that.

19:01.272 --> 19:04.807
They mine zenite for shipment,
till the soil.

19:04.984 --> 19:06.976
Those things cannot be done here.

19:07.152 --> 19:09.145
In other words,
they perform all the physical toil

19:09.321 --> 19:10.863
necessary to maintain Stratos.

19:11.031 --> 19:13.024
That is their function in our society.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.822
But they are not allowed to share
its advantages.

19:15.995 --> 19:18.664
How can they share
what they do not understand?

19:20.041 --> 19:21.369
They can be taught to understand,

19:21.542 --> 19:24.662
especially in a society
that prides itself in enlightenment.

19:24.837 --> 19:27.921
The complete separation
of toil and leisure

19:28.090 --> 19:32.799
has given Ardana this perfectly
balanced social system, captain.

19:32.970 --> 19:34.345
Why should we change it?

19:34.513 --> 19:37.799
The surface of the planet
is almost unendurable.

19:37.975 --> 19:40.727
To restrict a segment of the population
to such hardship

19:40.895 --> 19:43.516
is unthinkable in an evolved culture.

19:43.690 --> 19:47.354
The surface is marred by violence.

19:47.526 --> 19:49.898
Like the Troglytes.

19:52.031 --> 19:57.986
Here on Stratos, we have
completely eliminated violence.

20:02.583 --> 20:05.702
You still refuse to disclose
the names of other Disruptors?

20:05.877 --> 20:09.163
There are no Disruptors.

20:09.339 --> 20:12.210
Very well. If you prefer the rays.

20:20.560 --> 20:24.344
Troglyte is an abbreviation
of an ancient Earth term, captain.

20:24.521 --> 20:27.771
Its technical translation
is cave dweller.

20:27.941 --> 20:30.397
Yes. I should have realised...

20:40.329 --> 20:41.574
Mr. Advisor!

20:50.005 --> 20:52.710
You said you were going to
question Vanna, not torture her.

20:52.883 --> 20:56.383
She is stubborn and as you yourself
pointed out, captain,

20:56.554 --> 20:59.259
the search for your
zenite consignment must be short.

21:03.602 --> 21:05.725
Surely there are better methods
than this.

21:05.896 --> 21:08.434
Physical discomfort
is extremely persuasive, captain.

21:08.607 --> 21:12.142
Yes, but I won't stand by
while someone is tortured.

21:12.319 --> 21:14.478
Is it preferable to spare Vanna

21:14.655 --> 21:16.944
and allow an entire planet
to be destroyed?

21:17.116 --> 21:20.948
Violence in reality is quite different
from theory, is it not, madam?

21:21.120 --> 21:24.156
But what else
can they understand, Mr. Spock?

21:27.459 --> 21:29.867
All the little things
you and I understand

21:30.045 --> 21:31.753
and expect from life,

21:31.922 --> 21:35.505
such as equality, kindness, justice.

21:35.676 --> 21:38.594
Troglytes are not like
Stratos dwellers, Mr. Spock.

21:38.763 --> 21:41.336
They're a conglomerate
of inferior species.

21:41.516 --> 21:44.302
The abstract concepts
of an intellectual society

21:44.476 --> 21:46.303
are beyond their comprehension.

21:46.478 --> 21:49.230
The abstract concepts
of loyalty and leadership

21:49.398 --> 21:51.141
seem perfectly clear to Vanna.

21:51.317 --> 21:53.108
A few Troglytes are brought here
as retainers.

21:53.277 --> 21:55.815
Vanna was one of them,
as are the sentinels.

21:55.988 --> 21:57.815
They've received more training
than the others.

21:57.990 --> 21:59.782
But obviously no more consideration.

22:00.535 --> 22:03.950
I fail to see the purpose
of this continued criticism.

22:04.121 --> 22:08.997
The only way you'll use
that device again is on one of us.

22:10.336 --> 22:13.621
An imposing display
of primitive gallantry, gentlemen.

22:13.798 --> 22:16.289
You realise, of course, that
the sentinels could remove you?

22:17.134 --> 22:21.677
Of course, but Starfleet Command
won't take kindly to having either rays

22:21.847 --> 22:25.180
or physical force used against one of
its command personnel, Mr. Advisor.

22:25.350 --> 22:29.348
Why are you so concerned
with this Disruptor's well-being?

22:32.191 --> 22:36.189
Beyond plain humanitarianism,
my orders are to get that zenite.

22:36.362 --> 22:38.687
Then stop interfering
and I'll get it for you.

22:38.865 --> 22:40.691
You won't get it through torture!

22:40.866 --> 22:43.191
We will get it for you,
and in our own way.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.160
Remove the prisoner
to confinement quarters.

22:50.709 --> 22:52.536
You will return to your ship at once

22:54.005 --> 22:57.041
or I shall contact
your Starfleet Command myself

22:57.216 --> 22:59.541
and report your interference
with this planet's government.

23:06.350 --> 23:09.517
- Kirk to Enterprise.
- Enterprise, captain.

23:10.187 --> 23:13.722
- Mr. Scott, we're ready to beam up.
- Aye, sir.

23:26.453 --> 23:29.704
If Captain Kirk appears again,

23:30.583 --> 23:32.160
kill him.

23:39.383 --> 23:42.384
Captain's log, stardate 5819.0.

23:42.553 --> 23:43.833
More than eight hours have passed

23:44.012 --> 23:45.756
since the consignment
of zenite disappeared

23:45.931 --> 23:47.723
and we have still found no trace of it.

23:47.891 --> 23:49.434
We've received word from Merak II

23:49.602 --> 23:51.974
that the botanical plague
is spreading rapidly.

23:52.146 --> 23:55.064
Delivery of the zenite is imperative
within 12 hours

23:55.233 --> 23:58.067
or all life on the planet
will be annihilated.

23:58.235 --> 24:00.808
Lt. Uhura,
advise Starfleet Command

24:00.988 --> 24:02.945
that the zenite
has not been delivered.

24:03.115 --> 24:05.784
In my opinion, Plasus' method
of accomplishing delivery

24:05.951 --> 24:07.611
will not succeed.

24:07.786 --> 24:09.281
If the zenite is not delivered shortly,

24:09.455 --> 24:12.160
I shall have to violate
Plasus' order of non-interference

24:12.333 --> 24:14.622
and win the confidence
of the Troglyte leader

24:14.794 --> 24:16.253
with the use of reason.

24:16.420 --> 24:17.795
It may not be easy, Jim.

24:17.963 --> 24:21.332
Medical analysis indicates
the Troglytes are mentally inferior.

24:21.508 --> 24:22.789
That's impossible, Bones.

24:22.968 --> 24:26.171
The Troglytes have accepted
personal sacrifice, a common cause.

24:26.347 --> 24:29.182
Mentally inferior beings
aren't capable of that.

24:29.350 --> 24:31.639
Look, I've checked
my findings thoroughly.

24:31.811 --> 24:34.646
Their intellect ratings
are almost 20% below average.

24:34.814 --> 24:36.273
But they're all the same species.

24:36.439 --> 24:38.978
Those who live on Stratos
and those who live below

24:39.151 --> 24:40.978
all originated on the planet.

24:41.153 --> 24:43.905
Their physical and mental evolution
must be similar.

24:44.073 --> 24:45.650
That is basic biological law.

24:45.824 --> 24:46.939
That's true, Spock,

24:47.117 --> 24:49.822
but obviously the ancestors
of those who live on Stratos

24:49.995 --> 24:52.866
removed themselves
from the environment of the mines.

24:53.040 --> 24:56.491
Therefore, they avoided the effects
of certain natural growths.

24:56.668 --> 24:58.162
Natural growths? What kind?

24:58.337 --> 25:01.172
Well, I had this zenite sample sent up
from the surface.

25:01.340 --> 25:05.005
Now, unsealed, it would have had
detrimental effects on everybody here.

25:05.177 --> 25:08.344
Incredible. Zenite is shipped
all over the galaxy

25:08.514 --> 25:10.803
wherever there is danger
of plant bacteria.

25:10.975 --> 25:15.303
- No side effects have been reported.
- There are none after it's refined.

25:15.479 --> 25:19.856
But in its raw state,
it emits an odourless, invisible gas

25:20.025 --> 25:22.563
that retards the intellectual
functioning of the mind

25:22.736 --> 25:25.227
and heightens the emotion.

25:25.406 --> 25:28.857
Therefore,
it releases a violent reaction.

25:29.034 --> 25:31.526
And the mines are full of that gas.

25:31.704 --> 25:34.823
That's right. And the Troglytes
are constantly exposed to it.

25:34.998 --> 25:38.913
Bones, the Disruptors,
Vanna. It seems impossible.

25:39.086 --> 25:42.419
They've outwitted a highly-organised
scientific culture for months.

25:42.589 --> 25:44.547
As part of the staff of Stratos,

25:44.717 --> 25:47.386
Vanna was removed from exposure
for a long period.

25:47.553 --> 25:51.385
It is likely that without such exposure,
the effect slowly wears off.

25:51.557 --> 25:52.588
That's right, Spock.

25:52.767 --> 25:56.514
The other Disruptors were probably
removed from the exposure too.

25:56.686 --> 25:59.771
- Does the brain return to normal?
- According to findings, it should.

25:59.940 --> 26:01.565
Can you neutralise the gas?

26:01.733 --> 26:04.022
No, but a filter mask
should remove the exposure.

26:04.194 --> 26:06.686
Find one. Meet us in
the Transporter Room.

26:06.864 --> 26:11.407
This mask automatically eliminates
all substance injurious to humanoid life

26:11.577 --> 26:13.071
chemical as well as bacterial.

26:13.246 --> 26:15.570
We have used
these filter masks frequently on...

26:15.747 --> 26:18.499
Do you really expect me
to believe that that mask

26:18.667 --> 26:21.703
can achieve intellectual equality
for the Troglytes?

26:21.879 --> 26:24.002
There's every indication
that the effect of the gas

26:24.173 --> 26:26.711
is temporary,
even after repeated exposure.

26:26.884 --> 26:28.758
How can a mere filter accomplish

26:28.928 --> 26:31.419
what centuries of evolution
have failed to do?

26:31.597 --> 26:34.467
Dr. McCoy has analysed
the zenite thoroughly.

26:34.641 --> 26:36.468
We've checked his findings
through the computer,

26:36.643 --> 26:37.806
and they're absolutely valid.

26:37.978 --> 26:39.603
And do your computers explain

26:39.771 --> 26:42.607
how my ancestors,
who also dwelt in caverns,

26:42.775 --> 26:46.060
evolved sufficiently to erect Stratos,

26:46.237 --> 26:47.779
while the Troglytes did not?

26:48.447 --> 26:50.191
Unequal evolution did not begin

26:50.366 --> 26:52.773
until after your ancestors
removed themselves

26:52.951 --> 26:55.952
from constant exposure to the gas,
Mr. Advisor.

26:56.830 --> 26:58.111
Preposterous.

26:58.290 --> 26:59.950
There's no time to argue
about the findings.

27:00.125 --> 27:01.619
I propose to tell Vanna
all about them.

27:01.794 --> 27:04.795
I doubt whether even Vanna
will believe such nonsense.

27:04.964 --> 27:07.965
This nonsense might mean
a great deal to the Troglytes.

27:08.134 --> 27:10.755
I would like to offer them
a supply of these filter masks

27:10.928 --> 27:13.216
in exchange
for the zenite consignment.

27:13.388 --> 27:15.345
I'm sorry, captain.

27:15.515 --> 27:18.967
Such an offer could only cause
more unrest among them.

27:19.144 --> 27:22.264
I cannot allow it until our scientists
have checked the findings.

27:22.439 --> 27:24.895
- That could take days.
- Are you afraid the masks will work?

27:25.067 --> 27:27.143
Is that why you don't want
the Troglytes to try them?

27:27.319 --> 27:31.648
You are here to complete an
emergency mission, not conduct tests.

27:31.823 --> 27:33.021
I'm here to get that zenite.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.192
If these will help me get them,
then I'll use them.

27:35.369 --> 27:36.993
And I forbid it.

27:37.162 --> 27:41.705
Your Federation orders do not entitle
you to defy local governments.

27:41.875 --> 27:44.960
This communication has ended.

27:47.757 --> 27:51.623
My diplomacy
is somewhat inadequate.

27:51.801 --> 27:53.841
Well, it's pretty hard
to overcome prejudice.

27:54.012 --> 27:56.171
- Doesn't give us much choice, does it?
- Nor much time.

27:56.348 --> 28:00.013
We have ten hours and 40 minutes
to deliver that consignment to Merak II.

28:00.894 --> 28:02.638
Beam me down to Vanna's
confinement quarters.

28:02.813 --> 28:05.518
You mean you're going back to Stratos
against government orders?

28:05.691 --> 28:08.182
If Vanna doesn't have something
definite to gain for her people,

28:08.361 --> 28:10.566
she'll die rather than turn over
that zenite consignment.

28:10.737 --> 28:12.231
This might convince her.

28:12.405 --> 28:14.529
Captain, if you are apprehended

28:14.700 --> 28:17.155
deliberately violating
the high advisor's orders,

28:17.327 --> 28:20.198
he will be within his rights
to have you executed if he chooses.

28:20.372 --> 28:23.042
If you're about to suggest
that you contact Vanna,

28:23.208 --> 28:25.534
the answer's negative, Spock.
That goes for you, too, Bones.

28:25.711 --> 28:29.210
Allow me to point out
that a first officer is more expendable

28:29.381 --> 28:31.539
than either a doctor or a captain.

28:31.716 --> 28:33.875
Officially, but this mission
is strictly unofficial.

28:34.052 --> 28:37.137
Nobody's to have any part in it,
any responsibility for it, but myself.

28:37.306 --> 28:38.385
That's an order, Spock.

28:41.101 --> 28:42.845
You have the Conn.

28:43.771 --> 28:45.395
Stand by till I contact you.

28:58.827 --> 29:00.369
Vanna.

29:02.331 --> 29:04.288
I've brought you a gift.

29:04.458 --> 29:07.329
There's a dangerous gas
in the mines

29:07.503 --> 29:09.993
that affects
the development of Troglytes

29:10.171 --> 29:13.126
exposed to it for a period of time.

29:14.885 --> 29:16.794
This mask will prevent
any further damage.

29:18.263 --> 29:21.597
- Gas from zenite?
- Yes.

29:21.934 --> 29:24.721
It's hard to believe that something
which is neither seen nor felt

29:24.895 --> 29:26.093
can do so much harm.

29:26.272 --> 29:28.762
It's true,
but an idea can't be seen or felt.

29:28.940 --> 29:32.475
And that's kept the Troglytes
in the mines all these centuries.

29:32.652 --> 29:35.108
A mistaken idea.

29:35.781 --> 29:38.948
Would all the Troglytes
wear these masks?

29:39.118 --> 29:43.162
Yes. I'll see to it that the Federation
engineers construct them.

29:44.248 --> 29:46.573
Suppose Plasus does not agree?

29:46.750 --> 29:48.410
Plasus is not the whole government.

29:49.294 --> 29:52.745
That is true, but the city council

29:52.923 --> 29:55.129
will not listen to Troglytes.

29:55.300 --> 29:59.168
As soon as the zenite is delivered
to Merak II, I'll come back.

29:59.346 --> 30:04.721
I'll request permission to mediate
for the Troglytes. Vanna.

30:06.144 --> 30:08.137
You must trust me.

30:10.482 --> 30:12.273
I give you my word.

30:13.568 --> 30:16.404
Centuries ago,
Stratos was built by leaders

30:16.572 --> 30:20.404
that gave their word
that all inhabitants would live there.

30:20.576 --> 30:22.615
The Troglytes are still waiting.

30:22.786 --> 30:24.447
The zenite can be delivered
in a few hours.

30:24.622 --> 30:28.321
- You won't have long to wait now.
- Hours can be centuries.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.825
Just as words can be lies.

30:32.170 --> 30:33.914
Vanna.

30:35.716 --> 30:37.792
You must trust me.

30:38.552 --> 30:41.802
If you don't, millions of people
will die. A whole planet.

30:41.972 --> 30:43.882
This zenite is all that can save them.

30:44.058 --> 30:47.473
This filter mask is all
that can save the Troglytes.

30:51.773 --> 30:53.351
Trust me.

30:54.401 --> 30:56.358
Please.

31:00.115 --> 31:03.983
Very well, captain. I will trust you.

31:04.994 --> 31:07.367
The consignment lies
deep in the mines

31:07.539 --> 31:10.077
in a place known only to Troglytes.

31:10.250 --> 31:12.741
I cannot direct you.
I must take you there.

31:15.172 --> 31:20.961
You asked for my trust, captain.
Are you unwilling to give yours?

31:26.224 --> 31:29.142
It's the sentinel with my refreshment.

31:52.668 --> 31:57.164
Wait. We'll need a transport pass
to leave the city.

32:35.127 --> 32:36.538
- Midro.
- Vanna.

32:36.712 --> 32:38.918
- Anka.
- You have returned.

32:39.089 --> 32:42.422
And I've brought with me a hostage.
Seize him!

32:43.677 --> 32:45.468
We had a bargain.
Why did you break it?

32:45.637 --> 32:48.638
Did you really think
I would trust you, captain?

32:48.807 --> 32:52.472
- I'm not such a fool.
- I trusted you.

32:52.644 --> 32:55.645
You thought you would trick me
with your talk of your filter

32:55.814 --> 32:57.273
and your unseen gas.

32:57.441 --> 32:59.979
I don't believe you
any more than Plasus does.

33:00.777 --> 33:03.813
Then you are a fool. These masks
will free you, just as I said.

33:03.989 --> 33:06.028
Our weapons are our freedom

33:06.199 --> 33:10.327
and you've just furnished me
with two very valuable ones.

33:10.495 --> 33:13.117
Yourself and this.

33:13.290 --> 33:16.410
Holding me won't help you.
My men will still come for that zenite.

33:16.585 --> 33:20.878
Without your communicator,
you will be hard to locate.

33:21.047 --> 33:24.001
- They'll still come.
- Perhaps.

33:24.175 --> 33:28.505
In the meantime,
a taste of our existence, captain.

33:28.680 --> 33:32.049
Dig as the Troglytes do.
As the Troglytes do.

33:32.226 --> 33:34.514
Without that mask, I haven't...

33:40.442 --> 33:43.312
With your bare hands, captain.

33:58.043 --> 34:00.960
Captain's log supplemental,
stardate 5819.3.

34:01.129 --> 34:03.335
First Officer Spock reporting.

34:03.506 --> 34:05.214
Captain Kirk beamed down
to Stratos

34:05.383 --> 34:08.966
to attempts to win the confidence
of the rebel Troglytes.

34:09.137 --> 34:12.174
Unless he has made his escape
from Stratos to the mines,

34:12.349 --> 34:14.971
his life is in danger
from the high advisor.

34:15.143 --> 34:18.428
The captain has not informed us
of his progress.

34:18.605 --> 34:21.808
For our part,
we must maintain silence.

34:21.983 --> 34:26.728
We can be of no help to him
without jeopardising his life.

34:26.905 --> 34:28.898
You dig well, captain.

34:29.074 --> 34:31.612
The unseen gas doesn't seem
to be harming you.

34:31.784 --> 34:33.612
It takes a while
for its effects to be noticed.

34:33.786 --> 34:35.661
Nevertheless,
you won't be needing this.

34:35.831 --> 34:39.661
Anka, deposit this
on the transport platform,

34:39.833 --> 34:41.578
so Plasus will know
we have something

34:41.753 --> 34:46.000
more valuable to bargain with
than our mortaes and thongs.

34:46.174 --> 34:49.590
You are clever, Vanna, very clever.

34:51.847 --> 34:53.804
Searchers will
be coming soon, Midro.

34:53.974 --> 34:56.760
Go to other mines
and tell the Troglytes to post watchers.

34:56.935 --> 35:01.597
- What of him?
- I will see that he doesn't escape.

35:01.773 --> 35:03.932
If we kill him,
there will be no need to see.

35:04.109 --> 35:07.442
A dead hostage is of no value,
Midro.

35:07.612 --> 35:10.530
- Only the Troglytes will know.
- I brought him here.

35:10.699 --> 35:12.941
And I will say what is to be done.

35:13.118 --> 35:16.451
You are not the only Disruptor.
I, too, can say.

35:17.121 --> 35:21.416
Can you do nothing but argue?
The searchers will be here soon.

35:21.793 --> 35:26.455
When Anka returns, we will all say.

35:31.845 --> 35:34.336
Is that what you Disruptors
are bargaining for?

35:34.515 --> 35:36.305
The right to kill everyone?

35:36.474 --> 35:40.342
- Midro is a child.
- The masks can change that.

35:40.520 --> 35:43.225
Return to the digging, captain.

35:48.820 --> 35:50.363
How long do you plan
on keeping me here?

35:50.531 --> 35:52.856
Providing Midro doesn't kill me,
of course.

35:53.033 --> 35:58.454
Until we have help in the mines
and our homes are in the clouds.

36:00.457 --> 36:05.166
That's quite a while.
Longer than I expected.

36:41.539 --> 36:44.706
- We're sealed in.
- Completely.

36:46.878 --> 36:49.666
But soon the atmosphere will go.
We'll die.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.382
Die from something
that can't be seen?

36:51.550 --> 36:53.874
You astound me, Vanna.

36:54.052 --> 36:56.803
Kirk to Enterprise.
Enterprise, come in.

36:56.971 --> 37:00.257
Kirk to Enterprise.
Enterprise, come in.

37:00.433 --> 37:03.007
- Kirk to Enterprise.
- Spock here.

37:03.186 --> 37:05.724
We've been trying to make contact,
captain. Is anything wrong?

37:05.897 --> 37:07.890
Nothing, Mr. Spock.
Are you locked in on me?

37:08.066 --> 37:10.059
Locked in, and ready
to beam up consignment.

37:10.235 --> 37:13.734
Circumstances dictate
a slight variation, Spock.

37:14.530 --> 37:16.108
Standing by for instructions.

37:16.282 --> 37:18.322
Hold on these coordinates.

37:18.493 --> 37:22.954
Locate the high advisor and beam him
to these coordinates immediately.

37:23.123 --> 37:26.077
Without advance communication.
Repeat.

37:26.251 --> 37:29.585
Without advance communication.
Have you got that, Spock?

37:29.755 --> 37:35.045
Instructions clear. I shall carry
them out immediately. Spock out.

37:36.386 --> 37:39.802
You would seal Plasus here also?

37:39.973 --> 37:41.966
For what purpose?

37:42.142 --> 37:44.977
I'm preparing a demonstration.

37:46.480 --> 37:50.478
On the effects of unbelieved gas.

37:54.779 --> 37:57.982
Beam the high advisor down
without warning, did he say?

37:58.158 --> 38:02.108
That's not an exact quote, Mr. Scott.
However, it does express the thought.

38:02.287 --> 38:06.914
- I'd like to see the advisor's face.
- You will have that opportunity.

38:07.084 --> 38:09.539
The captain did say immediately,
did he not?

38:09.711 --> 38:12.628
Now, that is an exact quote,

38:12.797 --> 38:15.205
Mr. Scott, and I suggest
you handle the Transporter yourself.

38:15.383 --> 38:18.468
This could be very delicate
as a problem in transporting for us

38:18.637 --> 38:21.306
- and in diplomacy for the captain.
- Aye.

38:30.356 --> 38:33.441
- Something's upsetting you, Droxine.
- No, Father.

38:33.610 --> 38:37.109
- What is it? Tell me.
- No, really, I'm not upset.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.771
I was just standing here
looking into space

38:39.950 --> 38:42.026
and wondering whether or not
he would return.

38:42.202 --> 38:44.408
He will never return.
I have seen to that.

38:44.579 --> 38:48.245
But the zenite is so important to him.
He must have it.

38:48.417 --> 38:49.447
It will be delivered.

38:49.625 --> 38:52.033
If we have to kill every Troglyte below,
it will be delivered.

38:52.211 --> 38:56.340
By that time, it may be too late.
Perhaps he does have a method...

38:56.508 --> 39:01.336
He knows nothing, except how to
destroy our power and our society.

39:01.513 --> 39:05.677
I forbid you ever to speak
of Captain Kirk, even to think of him.

39:05.851 --> 39:09.764
- Transporter Room to Mr. Spock.
- Spock here.

39:09.937 --> 39:12.773
I've locked into the coordinates
of the cloud city council gallery.

39:12.941 --> 39:14.649
Ready to transport the high advisor.

39:14.818 --> 39:17.605
- You'll have to delay.
- What's wrong?

39:17.779 --> 39:20.187
I'm picking up two life-forms
in the gallery.

39:20.365 --> 39:23.200
They are inseparably close
to one another.

39:23.368 --> 39:26.702
We cannot transport one
without the other.

39:26.872 --> 39:28.531
Did you say the word "immediately"

39:28.706 --> 39:30.699
was an exact quote
of the captain's order?

39:30.875 --> 39:33.283
- Precisely, Mr. Scott.
- Well,

39:33.461 --> 39:35.952
are we going to do anything
about it?

39:36.131 --> 39:38.123
Until the high advisor is alone

39:38.300 --> 39:41.716
or can be isolated,
the captain will have to wait.

39:41.887 --> 39:44.722
Unless you have an alternative.

39:44.890 --> 39:47.594
I'll give it further thought.

39:49.560 --> 39:52.561
I wasn't thinking of Captain Kirk.

39:52.730 --> 39:57.025
It's the one with
those exquisitely-shaped ears.

39:57.402 --> 40:02.064
His name is Spock.
He's the one I was thinking about.

40:02.240 --> 40:06.073
Did you know that he has the most
incredibly sensitive hearing?

40:06.245 --> 40:12.448
Why, I almost believe that
if I stood here and called out to him,

40:12.625 --> 40:15.377
he would hear my invitation
to come and visit with us

40:15.545 --> 40:17.004
for a little while longer.

40:17.172 --> 40:19.710
Oh, he's no better than his friend.

40:19.883 --> 40:21.876
Shall we try?

40:22.052 --> 40:23.380
What is it?

40:23.553 --> 40:25.297
The Disruptor Vanna
has disappeared.

40:25.472 --> 40:27.547
Her guard was found
half-unconscious.

40:27.724 --> 40:30.297
- He'd been attacked by Captain Kirk.
- Where is Captain Kirk?

40:30.476 --> 40:34.177
He did not know, sir. He did not regain
his senses until I came to his aid.

40:34.355 --> 40:36.977
This is the kind of reason
they use to persuade us.

40:37.150 --> 40:41.777
- They are desperate.
- I will hear no more defence of them.

40:43.282 --> 40:46.614
I'm sure Mr. Spock
would not behave so.

40:46.784 --> 40:50.533
Leave here at once.
Go to your music.

40:54.042 --> 40:57.660
Father, are we
so sure of our methods

40:57.838 --> 41:01.207
that we never question what we do?

41:05.762 --> 41:07.470
- Spock to Transporter Room.
- Scott here.

41:07.638 --> 41:10.758
- Lock on council gallery coordinates.
- Locked in, sir.

41:10.934 --> 41:12.761
- Energize.
- Aye, sir.

41:13.395 --> 41:15.268
Energizing.

41:20.152 --> 41:22.857
- How are you doing, Mr. Scott?
- Fine, Mr. Spock.

41:23.030 --> 41:25.983
The high advisor is materialising
on the platform.

41:26.157 --> 41:30.155
- Beam him down to Captain Kirk.
- Energizing, sir.

41:30.328 --> 41:34.492
- He's on his way to the captain.
- Good work, Mr. Scott.

41:34.666 --> 41:36.540
The advisor looked mighty angry.

41:36.710 --> 41:38.952
I hope he doesn't
give the captain too much trouble.

41:39.129 --> 41:43.506
The captain will employ
his usual diplomatic balm.

41:43.675 --> 41:46.510
Abduction of a planet official
is a serious crime.

41:46.677 --> 41:48.670
You will pay for this, I promise you.

41:48.846 --> 41:52.298
Not until you're convinced of the
effects of the zenite gas. Mr. Advisor.

41:52.475 --> 41:55.013
What effects? I've been here
nearly an hour of your Earth time!

41:55.186 --> 41:59.019
You and Vanna even longer!
I see no changes in any of us.

42:02.152 --> 42:06.019
Perhaps you need closer exposure.
Fill that container.

42:08.324 --> 42:11.160
Are you suggesting that I dig zenite?

42:11.327 --> 42:16.037
- I insist.
- You will indeed pay for this.

42:23.464 --> 42:25.256
You, too, Vanna.

42:26.300 --> 42:28.210
You, too! Dig!

42:38.355 --> 42:39.849
Kirk here. What is it?

42:40.023 --> 42:41.138
Contact check, captain.

42:41.316 --> 42:43.557
It has been an hour
since your last communication.

42:43.734 --> 42:48.195
Your orders are to stand by.
Now, carry them out. Kirk out.

42:48.740 --> 42:50.068
Standing by, captain.

42:50.241 --> 42:53.860
However, let me remind you
we have only five hours left.

42:56.998 --> 43:01.576
- Very unlike the captain.
- Can the zenite be affecting him?

43:07.926 --> 43:09.835
I grow faint.

43:11.596 --> 43:13.755
The oxygen is going.

43:14.266 --> 43:17.432
She's right.
Kirk, transport us out of here.

43:17.602 --> 43:20.769
We'll leave when the gas has effect.

43:20.938 --> 43:24.224
It will never take effect.
Transport us out of here!

43:26.402 --> 43:28.940
- Dig!
- Imbecile. We'll die!

43:29.113 --> 43:30.572
I said dig!

43:34.995 --> 43:38.613
I am high advisor of all the planet.

43:38.790 --> 43:41.115
I will take no more orders!

43:41.292 --> 43:43.783
- One more step and I'll kill you.
- The gas.

43:43.961 --> 43:46.287
Captain, you were right.
It's taking effect.

43:46.464 --> 43:48.671
Captain, you were right.

43:51.094 --> 43:54.297
Are you as brave with mortae
as you are with a phaser?

43:54.472 --> 43:56.181
Both will kill.

44:42.770 --> 44:46.389
Enterprise! Enterprise, help!

44:46.816 --> 44:50.020
- Enterprise!
- Enterprise. Spock here.

44:50.195 --> 44:52.152
They'll kill each other. Help us.

44:52.322 --> 44:53.401
Help us!

44:57.160 --> 44:59.697
Enterprise! Enterprise!

45:21.392 --> 45:24.097
The zenite gas has affected you.
Captain!

45:26.564 --> 45:28.723
The zenite gas!

45:30.860 --> 45:32.604
Zenite gas.

45:32.779 --> 45:35.021
- Look out, Jim!
- Captain!

45:48.420 --> 45:49.795
Well.

45:51.214 --> 45:54.334
It seems my little
demonstration was...

45:55.260 --> 45:57.051
...quite a success.

46:05.019 --> 46:09.349
I don't like filters, or even masks.

46:09.524 --> 46:13.107
I like the word "protector"
much better,

46:13.695 --> 46:15.521
don't you?

46:16.113 --> 46:20.443
It is less technical,
therefore less accurate.

46:20.618 --> 46:24.118
But perhaps more generally
descriptive of the function.

46:24.289 --> 46:26.958
It appears you have
what you came for after all.

46:27.584 --> 46:30.787
The captain will have his zenite
just as I agreed.

46:30.962 --> 46:34.462
Agreed? There's no such word
in the Troglyte vocabulary.

46:34.632 --> 46:36.624
The captain will have his zenite.

46:36.801 --> 46:39.968
No thanks to any agreement by you.
It had to be obtained by force.

46:40.138 --> 46:43.304
Because it is the only way
we can obtain what is due us.

46:43.474 --> 46:45.633
How about your education?
Was that by force?

46:45.810 --> 46:48.645
It served your purpose at the time.

46:48.813 --> 46:51.518
You could have had those filters,
for all the good it will do you.

46:51.691 --> 46:54.182
They will be very effective, sir.
They've been severely tested.

46:54.360 --> 46:55.984
And the Troglytes
will no longer suffer

46:56.153 --> 46:59.024
from retardation
and emotional difficulties.

46:59.198 --> 47:02.698
They will all be like her.
Ungrateful, vindictive.

47:02.869 --> 47:06.819
Yes. Our demands have just begun.

47:09.542 --> 47:12.294
Here is the zenite, captain.

47:13.004 --> 47:16.538
- Just as I promised.
- Thank you, Vanna.

47:17.133 --> 47:21.000
Stratos is so pleasant
and so beautiful.

47:22.180 --> 47:24.172
I think I'm afraid to leave it.

47:24.349 --> 47:29.058
There is great beauty
in the knowledge that lies below.

47:30.105 --> 47:33.188
And only one way
to really experience it.

47:33.357 --> 47:36.477
I shall go to the mines.

47:38.196 --> 47:41.362
I no longer wish
to be limited to the clouds.

47:43.117 --> 47:44.576
Is...

47:44.911 --> 47:46.868
...your planet like this one?

47:47.038 --> 47:48.865
No.

47:50.166 --> 47:53.748
No, Vulcan is quite different.

47:55.463 --> 47:57.870
Some day I should like to visit it.

48:00.677 --> 48:02.385
Perhaps some form of mediation

48:02.554 --> 48:04.546
can be helpful in your difficulties.

48:04.722 --> 48:08.672
The Federation Bureau of
Industrialization may be of aid to you.

48:08.852 --> 48:11.307
I will tolerate absolutely
no interference!

48:11.480 --> 48:14.183
You will not set foot here
as long as I rule!

48:14.357 --> 48:17.975
Believe me, sir, I have neither
the time nor the desire to return here.

48:18.152 --> 48:21.272
Only answering your charges
against me will force me back.

48:21.447 --> 48:24.733
And I shall press them.
You are guilty of abduction, captain!

48:24.909 --> 48:26.736
You're guilty of attacking
a starship commander

48:26.911 --> 48:28.572
- and plotting against his life.
- Captain,

48:28.747 --> 48:32.245
perhaps both incidents
are best forgotten.

48:37.130 --> 48:39.087
Yes, Vanna.

48:41.759 --> 48:44.048
They never happened, Mr. Advisor.

48:50.018 --> 48:51.761
Mr. Spock,
let's get that zenite delivered.

48:51.936 --> 48:54.059
I believe we only have
three hours left.

48:54.230 --> 48:57.765
Two hours, 59 minutes
to be exact, captain.

49:10.996 --> 49:14.413
Kirk to Enterprise.
Kirk to Enterprise.

49:14.584 --> 49:18.368
Mr. Scott, beam us up.
