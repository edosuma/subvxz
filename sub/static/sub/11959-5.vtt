00:34.530 --> 00:35.550
Hold them back!

01:04.590 --> 01:10.244
The denizens of Hell will
not keep me from my throne.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.331
I am your king,

01:14.550 --> 01:16.520
appointed by God,

01:18.610 --> 01:20.815
and my kingdom awaits.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.365
You.

01:25.470 --> 01:27.032
Have this place redecorated.

01:27.057 --> 01:29.315
It's my son's birthday today.

01:29.340 --> 01:31.183
It's not fit for a dog,

01:32.467 --> 01:34.073
let alone a monarch.

01:42.351 --> 01:44.261
What's happening, Marcheaux?

01:44.286 --> 01:46.366
The prisoners attacked
the guard and stole his keys!

01:46.510 --> 01:48.309
The whole Chatelet is wide open,

01:48.334 --> 01:49.745
and they're not going to go
back into their cells

01:49.770 --> 01:51.520
like nice little sheep.

01:51.530 --> 01:52.861
You think you can do any better?

01:52.886 --> 01:54.111
I know we can.

02:01.550 --> 02:02.943
Put a line at the gates!

02:06.450 --> 02:07.826
You are wasting time!

02:09.301 --> 02:10.354
Fall back!

02:10.646 --> 02:11.893
Fall back!

02:32.320 --> 02:35.717
The prisoners must not return
until the midday bell.

02:35.742 --> 02:39.500
It will take the Red Guard that
long to secure the Chatelet.

02:39.510 --> 02:41.640
I'm told the whole place is in chaos.

02:42.126 --> 02:43.513
Chaos is good.

02:44.490 --> 02:48.083
A man with a clear purpose
always prevails.

02:49.143 --> 02:51.630
Alas, my purpose

02:51.640 --> 02:56.560
is to play the fawning uncle at
the Dauphin's birthday party.

02:56.570 --> 02:59.440
The more distractions
at the palace, the better.

03:00.470 --> 03:02.839
We will soon have our war chest.

03:02.894 --> 03:04.460
That's all that matters.

03:04.470 --> 03:06.795
And the moment the King is dead,

03:07.470 --> 03:10.500
we can move in with Gaston
at the head of an army.

03:21.610 --> 03:23.499
Where are the Musketeers?

03:23.500 --> 03:25.225
Marcheaux's keeping them busy.

03:25.250 --> 03:26.953
We're nearly through
to the lower chamber.

03:35.891 --> 03:37.258
Get up.

03:38.271 --> 03:39.898
Leave me alone.

03:40.749 --> 03:42.819
I have nothing to do with any of this.

03:42.844 --> 03:45.012
Joubert, you are wrong.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.615
This is all about you.

04:16.434 --> 04:19.134
<font color="#32a615"><b>Synced & corrected by</b></font> <b> kinglouisxx</b>
<font color="#32a615"><b>www.addic7ed.com</b></font>

04:36.669 --> 04:40.153
How many prisoners have escaped
into the streets, Marcheaux?

04:40.521 --> 04:41.847
There's no way of telling.

04:41.872 --> 04:43.712
Why don't you go and find out?

04:45.585 --> 04:47.328
Get along, I say!

04:47.741 --> 04:51.357
Captain Marcheaux, if my men and
I pursue those unaccounted for,

04:51.382 --> 04:53.906
I trust this won't descend
into street theatre.

04:54.281 --> 04:56.611
Don't bring them back before midday.

04:56.621 --> 04:59.961
It's chaos inside. It will
take time to regain control.

04:59.986 --> 05:02.034
What are we supposed
to do with them until then?

05:03.482 --> 05:05.128
You have a garrison.

05:05.641 --> 05:07.112
Use it.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.377
The Red Guard are busy.

05:10.238 --> 05:11.278
Captain?

05:12.047 --> 05:13.211
Fine.

05:24.611 --> 05:27.310
You are wasting precious time, Joubert.

05:27.390 --> 05:30.380
You won't kill me. You need me alive.

05:30.461 --> 05:32.491
That's what this is about, isn't it?

05:32.601 --> 05:35.446
Your skills are valuable to me.

05:36.145 --> 05:39.275
Your wife, however, is not.

05:39.691 --> 05:41.341
Annabelle.

05:42.112 --> 05:43.360
You want to hurt her.

05:43.893 --> 05:45.818
You really don't wanna push me.

05:46.478 --> 05:48.788
Now give me what I want!

05:51.146 --> 05:53.178
We must transform this little palace

05:53.430 --> 05:55.295
into a magical fairyland.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.793
Anything you desire, Majesty.

05:56.818 --> 05:59.037
Money is no object.

05:59.410 --> 06:00.834
As I promised,

06:01.139 --> 06:03.430
the Dauphin will remember
this birthday forever!

06:04.179 --> 06:05.209
Yes.

06:05.370 --> 06:08.607
He must remember
every moment, every detail.

06:09.340 --> 06:11.203
It is not everyday a boy turns six.

06:11.228 --> 06:14.330
This is already more than any
boy could ever wish for.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.618
Your generosity is greatly
appreciated, Governor.

06:16.643 --> 06:19.300
The Governor of Paris has plenty
of money, isn't that right, Feron?

06:20.380 --> 06:23.805
It seems the Dutch ambassador
will be unable to attend today.

06:24.075 --> 06:27.310
The Dutch government is sending the
financier Van Laar in his place.

06:27.730 --> 06:30.211
- Van Laar?
- You know him?

06:31.503 --> 06:33.041
Come, I want to see the presents.

06:33.066 --> 06:36.095
We have so many, we have had
to put some in another room.

06:42.192 --> 06:45.016
There's a dangerous situation
developing at the Chatalet.

06:45.041 --> 06:47.001
I'm quite aware of it, Treville.

06:47.011 --> 06:49.991
Yet your men approved utterly
ineffectual in stopping it.

06:51.051 --> 06:52.981
Feron, are you listening?

06:52.991 --> 06:55.135
There are dangerous criminals
on the streets of Paris,

06:55.160 --> 06:56.843
while you plan party games.

06:56.868 --> 06:59.524
It is expected of me
just as it is expected

06:59.549 --> 07:01.740
that I pay for all this.

07:01.881 --> 07:05.659
The King doesn't care what is
happening out there, Treville.

07:05.951 --> 07:07.720
Today is about one thing.

07:08.642 --> 07:10.732
Open your eyes, look around you.

07:36.324 --> 07:37.820
No, it's mine!

07:38.387 --> 07:40.527
This isn't the kind
of world I want to live in,

07:40.921 --> 07:44.020
where a man must steal
to feed his family.

07:44.292 --> 07:46.990
There's got to be something better.

07:48.018 --> 07:49.514
That's what my father believed.

07:50.856 --> 07:51.958
One voice...

07:53.548 --> 07:55.518
struggles to be heard.

07:55.543 --> 07:58.891
But if we speak together,

07:59.261 --> 08:02.251
surely, the King must hear us.

08:05.271 --> 08:06.508
Look in there!

08:06.533 --> 08:07.944
Red Guard.

08:08.150 --> 08:09.391
Stay where you are!

08:10.291 --> 08:11.381
All of you!

08:13.235 --> 08:14.691
You got any food?

08:16.331 --> 08:18.441
Warn Constance there will be more.

08:18.770 --> 08:20.700
They're heading for the refugee camp.

08:22.745 --> 08:23.745
Move!

08:50.351 --> 08:51.616
Who are you?

08:52.251 --> 08:53.321
What do you want?

08:55.825 --> 08:58.805
You have no business with us
here, Musketeers. Now, get out.

08:59.598 --> 09:01.548
Four men came this way,

09:01.573 --> 09:02.883
escaped prisoners.

09:02.908 --> 09:04.524
You are the only strangers in here.

09:19.757 --> 09:21.627
You better come with me.

09:22.281 --> 09:23.281
Now!

09:51.241 --> 09:52.711
Still peddling sedition.

09:52.736 --> 09:54.806
There's nothing written on there
that any of us are ashamed of.

09:54.831 --> 09:57.211
They had nothing to do with
what happened at the Chatelet.

09:57.221 --> 09:58.351
How can you be sure?

09:58.865 --> 10:00.250
We both know
there's a lot more to this...

10:00.251 --> 10:01.361
You have my word.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.301
Let's leave these two alone, shall we?

10:07.217 --> 10:08.231
Move.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.431
Athos, what will happen to those men?

10:34.456 --> 10:36.281
That is not my decision.

10:36.291 --> 10:37.894
You sound like a Red Guard.

10:41.509 --> 10:45.546
When Aramis told me you gave
away your land and titles,

10:45.578 --> 10:48.619
I thought it was because you believe
no man to be above any other.

10:48.644 --> 10:50.079
But now I see it was fear.

10:50.104 --> 10:52.906
I just didn't want that life.

10:54.074 --> 10:55.184
What life do you want?

10:58.937 --> 11:02.271
Most of the men you're chasing
aren't dangerous, but desperate.

11:02.281 --> 11:04.438
The desperate become dangerous.

11:04.463 --> 11:07.729
Governor Feron makes cellmates
of the innocent and the guilty.

11:23.401 --> 11:26.963
I will not help you
steal the King's gold reserves.

11:26.988 --> 11:29.281
I won't do it. You'll never make me.

11:31.714 --> 11:33.321
Annabelle's locket.

11:33.604 --> 11:36.451
My men have prepared the way for you.

11:37.132 --> 11:38.172
Take him down.

11:40.829 --> 11:42.809
Return to your homes quickly.

11:42.834 --> 11:44.442
It's no longer safe on the streets.

11:44.467 --> 11:46.231
Please, take what
you've been given, and go.

11:46.241 --> 11:47.331
Where are you going?

11:47.434 --> 11:49.424
I'm worried about Annabelle Joubert.

11:49.512 --> 11:51.303
She is usually first at the gates.

11:51.328 --> 11:53.378
She's probably just locked
her doors and stayed in.

11:54.655 --> 11:57.231
You don't understand. She's blind.

11:58.871 --> 12:00.721
I'm coming with you.

12:03.648 --> 12:06.882
Van Laar, pleasure to see you again.

12:07.576 --> 12:09.980
We're sorry to hear of the
Ambassador's incapacity.

12:10.005 --> 12:11.805
Yes, of course. Of course.

12:11.830 --> 12:13.326
Uh, forgive me, Minister,

12:13.884 --> 12:17.605
I speak as a loyal servant
and admirer of the King, but, um...

12:18.593 --> 12:20.698
the loan that His Majesty took out...

12:20.723 --> 12:24.301
The interest repayment is
overdue, a trifle, I'm sure.

12:24.338 --> 12:26.288
There must be some mistake.

12:26.442 --> 12:28.263
No, the repayment schedule
is quite clear.

12:28.288 --> 12:31.449
I granted the loan only
under the strictest terms.

12:32.281 --> 12:35.603
I believe it was a private arrangement.

12:35.632 --> 12:38.692
A necklace that the King
has had made for the Queen.

12:39.012 --> 12:41.301
Governor Feron brokered the transaction.

12:41.311 --> 12:42.321
Feron?

12:43.481 --> 12:44.481
I see.

12:45.702 --> 12:47.673
How much money are we talking about?

12:48.241 --> 12:49.654
A substantial sum.

12:50.196 --> 12:51.246
Two million livre.

13:14.284 --> 13:16.264
It took me six months
to design this lock,

13:17.150 --> 13:19.424
two smiths a month
to construct the door.

13:20.161 --> 13:21.364
It's over a foot thick.

13:24.521 --> 13:26.874
My tools and plans.

13:28.270 --> 13:31.370
You have until midday to dismantle it.

13:32.904 --> 13:35.431
But if I try to remove
any of the individual pieces,

13:35.441 --> 13:38.193
the mechanism I designed
will deadlock the door.

13:40.551 --> 13:42.581
You have to believe me.

13:42.591 --> 13:46.491
If you try to blow it open with
gunpowder, you'll bring down the roof.

13:46.785 --> 13:48.533
Drilling at it might take a week.

13:50.521 --> 13:51.977
Open the vault,

13:52.666 --> 13:54.521
or she dies.

13:56.226 --> 13:57.226
Slowly.

14:01.468 --> 14:02.557
I will have to make a new key.

14:02.820 --> 14:04.471
How long?

14:05.591 --> 14:07.206
Some time.

14:07.231 --> 14:09.564
It's the only way, I swear it.

14:12.435 --> 14:14.237
I'll need as many keys as you can find.

14:15.671 --> 14:18.165
I can use them to make a new one.

14:22.205 --> 14:23.370
Bring him what he needs.

14:28.114 --> 14:31.471
Annabelle's husband Victor
fell ill and got into debt.

14:32.193 --> 14:33.293
They lost everything.

14:33.481 --> 14:36.339
Seems like Paris is full of
people that have lost everything.

14:36.985 --> 14:38.950
And the rest are
a stroke of bad luck away

14:38.975 --> 14:42.277
from having to choose between
stealing and starving.

14:42.302 --> 14:43.431
Here.

14:43.456 --> 14:45.675
If the husband did escape with
the others from the Chatelet

14:45.700 --> 14:47.014
he might be desperate.

14:47.491 --> 14:49.891
Annabelle never spoke of him
as being violent.

14:50.132 --> 14:52.711
Six months in the wrong
company can change any man.

15:03.601 --> 15:05.481
Annabelle?

15:05.491 --> 15:08.480
Something's wrong. She
wouldn't just desert her home.

15:08.481 --> 15:09.561
She didn't.

15:12.310 --> 15:14.091
Some men took her.

15:21.096 --> 15:22.136
Feron.

15:25.137 --> 15:26.571
I've been looking for you.

15:26.581 --> 15:28.591
Now you've found me. Well done.

15:29.204 --> 15:33.059
I just had a very interesting
conversation with your friend, Van Laar.

15:36.542 --> 15:38.512
Do not touch me, sir.

15:40.461 --> 15:43.229
You took out a loan with him
on the King's behalf.

15:43.254 --> 15:44.480
I should've been told.

15:44.481 --> 15:45.480
Ah!

15:45.481 --> 15:47.975
A private affair, not your concern.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.489
Everything regarding the King
is my concern.

15:50.514 --> 15:54.775
Oh, really? The King wants to
buy a gift to placate his wife.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.452
But perhaps you'd prefer to
question His Majesty yourself

15:57.477 --> 15:59.729
concerning the unfortunate
state of his marriage.

16:02.013 --> 16:03.908
You won't object then

16:03.933 --> 16:06.644
if I deliver these letters
to His Majesty

16:07.330 --> 16:08.927
on Van Laar's behalf?

16:09.253 --> 16:11.004
Of course not. Why should I?

16:35.501 --> 16:37.441
How much longer?

16:39.451 --> 16:40.919
It's a delicate mechanism.

16:41.128 --> 16:42.460
The key has to be just right.

16:48.184 --> 16:49.556
Don't resist.

16:55.176 --> 16:56.206
Move on.

16:57.571 --> 16:58.571
Move.

16:59.521 --> 17:01.165
There's another one.

17:01.190 --> 17:03.551
- Need help?
- No, I'll deal with it.

17:03.561 --> 17:05.521
I'll be at the garrison.

17:12.471 --> 17:16.223
Captain, Minister Treville
is waiting in your office.

17:16.491 --> 17:19.650
Make sure the prisoners get food
and water before they go back.

17:19.675 --> 17:20.694
Yes, sir.

17:28.342 --> 17:29.704
It's yours if you want it back.

17:33.491 --> 17:36.471
- Is everything under control?
- I think so.

17:36.481 --> 17:39.461
We're on our own out there, the
Red Guard are nowhere to be seen.

17:39.471 --> 17:42.451
Why are the prisoners
here and not in the Chatelet?

17:42.461 --> 17:45.471
Marcheaux told us not to return
with them until the midday bell.

17:47.461 --> 17:49.408
There's something
very wrong about today.

17:50.471 --> 17:53.420
Governor Feron has borrowed
two million livre

17:53.421 --> 17:55.138
from the Dutch in the King's name.

17:56.481 --> 17:58.206
Louis knows nothing about it.

17:58.231 --> 18:00.341
- Tell him.
- He won't listen.

18:00.766 --> 18:01.836
Not today.

18:02.130 --> 18:04.413
I've left Van Laar's letters
for him to find.

18:05.391 --> 18:07.794
When he does, Feron will be finished.

18:39.881 --> 18:41.295
Oh, oh!

18:41.320 --> 18:42.450
It's you.

18:42.733 --> 18:45.180
Playing a game, Little Majesty, hmm?

18:46.295 --> 18:48.843
Well, perhaps now that I've found you,

18:48.868 --> 18:51.391
it would be better if you hid elsewhere?

18:51.423 --> 18:53.448
As far away as possible actually.

18:54.471 --> 18:55.670
Otherwise,

18:55.695 --> 18:59.758
we might hide you somewhere
Mama and Papa will never find you, mmm?

18:59.783 --> 19:01.260
What're you doing in here, Philippe?

19:02.580 --> 19:03.814
Oh!

19:03.839 --> 19:05.887
We were playing a game, Majesty.

19:05.912 --> 19:10.401
My ingenious nephew took some
seeking, I can assure you.

19:10.986 --> 19:12.165
Ah!

19:12.190 --> 19:16.190
Forgive me. All that exertion,
I'm a little bit in pain.

19:16.421 --> 19:17.999
You mustn't trouble your uncle.

19:18.024 --> 19:21.441
Oh, don't be too hard on the poor boy.
I just need a moment, you know.

19:23.570 --> 19:24.869
Let's sit, hmm?

19:26.918 --> 19:27.948
No. No.

19:27.973 --> 19:31.381
I've too much to do, as I'm sure you do.

19:31.391 --> 19:33.501
I think it's time he had a rest.

19:36.014 --> 19:39.946
Well, um, we'll play again
soon, Little Majesty.

19:41.017 --> 19:42.017
Good day.

19:56.057 --> 19:57.760
This is where they took her.

20:02.521 --> 20:05.068
Rochelle, you go home now.

20:06.041 --> 20:07.041
Leave this to us.

20:27.531 --> 20:30.350
What do you want with me?
Please. I have no money.

20:30.375 --> 20:33.823
The locket, it was a gift
from my husband.

21:06.250 --> 21:07.624
Let's say hello, shall we?

21:12.157 --> 21:13.329
Can we,

21:14.153 --> 21:16.662
all five of us,
discuss this as gentlemen?

21:16.687 --> 21:18.095
Just kill them both.

21:20.036 --> 21:21.036
Obviously not!

21:44.187 --> 21:45.237
Constance.

21:46.405 --> 21:47.484
How did you know?

21:47.521 --> 21:50.303
- You have the scent of the garrison.
- Really?

21:50.776 --> 21:52.235
In a good way.

21:54.004 --> 21:55.944
I'll take that as a compliment,

21:56.537 --> 21:57.547
I think.

22:11.775 --> 22:13.501
He's coming. I can hear him.

22:27.388 --> 22:29.215
Where have you been?

22:43.152 --> 22:44.202
Heaven help me.

23:00.503 --> 23:01.798
Hey, hey, hey.

23:13.238 --> 23:14.288
Help me.

23:16.257 --> 23:17.407
I'm frightened.

23:20.319 --> 23:23.279
They're sending assassins to kill me.

23:25.198 --> 23:26.558
I have to take you back to the Chatelet.

23:26.583 --> 23:28.848
No. No!

23:29.208 --> 23:31.050
No, no, no. Not that place, please.

23:31.258 --> 23:32.790
Take this. Take it.

23:33.238 --> 23:35.208
Take it. I'm not gonna hurt you.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.802
Just not back there, please.

23:49.358 --> 23:50.937
You're a soldier?

23:54.756 --> 23:56.244
Was I?

24:00.272 --> 24:01.407
Oh, yes.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.288
Yes. That's right.

24:09.524 --> 24:11.520
And I was a brave one, too.

24:15.592 --> 24:17.492
Reckless, some said.

24:19.010 --> 24:20.248
Really?

24:21.815 --> 24:23.318
That was before

24:26.348 --> 24:27.418
he got in there.

24:29.799 --> 24:30.809
In your head?

24:30.834 --> 24:31.986
Mmm.

24:32.258 --> 24:33.278
Who?

24:34.558 --> 24:35.992
The imposter.

24:37.848 --> 24:39.818
The one who says that he's the King.

24:43.218 --> 24:45.348
I need to get to the palace.

24:45.737 --> 24:47.747
Thieves plot to steal my gold

24:47.772 --> 24:49.398
on my son's birthday, too.

24:49.816 --> 24:51.499
Perhaps I can help you.

24:52.218 --> 24:55.258
If I find somewhere safe for you
to go, will you come with me?

25:02.558 --> 25:03.558
Your Majesty.

25:05.777 --> 25:07.247
Will you come with me?

25:25.208 --> 25:26.368
We need more time.

25:26.642 --> 25:29.449
Have Feron delay the return of the
prisoners until the late bell.

25:29.474 --> 25:31.544
We make our escape this evening. Go.

25:41.886 --> 25:43.313
I shouldn't have done that.

25:51.318 --> 25:52.318
You...

25:52.815 --> 25:55.278
You won't take me back to that place?

25:58.278 --> 25:59.288
No.

26:00.925 --> 26:02.978
No, I won't. I want to help you.

26:05.656 --> 26:06.782
Very well.

26:07.694 --> 26:10.363
We will return to the palace.

26:10.773 --> 26:12.218
Very good.

26:13.983 --> 26:15.442
Three paces behind.

26:16.485 --> 26:17.545
Of course.

26:30.705 --> 26:32.665
All this excitement...

26:37.017 --> 26:40.288
Why are you making such a fuss
of this particular birthday?

26:42.659 --> 26:44.599
You're exhausting yourself.

26:47.763 --> 26:48.763
Louis.

26:51.618 --> 26:53.618
We used to talk together.

26:55.001 --> 26:56.904
Now I feel I hardly know you.

26:57.208 --> 26:59.977
It is you none of us
really know, my dear.

27:00.875 --> 27:03.715
So many secrets.

27:05.633 --> 27:06.733
I don't understand.

27:12.723 --> 27:15.563
My son must remember this day.

27:16.395 --> 27:18.137
But there will be many others.

27:21.585 --> 27:22.615
Louis.

27:24.606 --> 27:26.244
I am your wife.

27:28.238 --> 27:30.036
Will you not speak to me?

27:31.258 --> 27:32.298
Louis.

27:33.956 --> 27:35.235
Please.

27:40.519 --> 27:41.883
I'm lonely.

27:56.259 --> 27:57.399
Governor.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.828
I've a message from a friend.

28:00.361 --> 28:01.323
Here?

28:01.512 --> 28:03.438
We haven't even got through
to the vault, yet.

28:03.884 --> 28:05.141
What?

28:05.546 --> 28:06.586
If we're to escape with the gold

28:06.611 --> 28:08.219
as the prisoners
are returned to the Chatelet,

28:08.244 --> 28:09.819
we need more time.

28:09.851 --> 28:12.831
Grimaud says don't send them back in
until the late bell this evening.

28:12.856 --> 28:14.126
Do not mention that name here.

28:14.151 --> 28:16.239
Now, go before anyone sees you. Get out!

28:16.831 --> 28:18.121
Van Laar?

28:18.901 --> 28:20.389
A word, if you pray.

28:20.414 --> 28:22.115
Governor Feron!

28:22.140 --> 28:25.287
How good it is to see you again.

28:25.311 --> 28:27.851
We had quite a time of it
last time we met, hmm?

28:27.876 --> 28:29.417
Dear friend. Come.

28:36.839 --> 28:40.064
You were expressly told

28:40.553 --> 28:43.660
our transaction was a private matter.

28:45.672 --> 28:47.266
There has been some misunderstanding.

28:47.291 --> 28:50.066
Minister Treville
is the King's trusted advisor.

28:50.282 --> 28:53.932
Minister Treville is not family.

28:54.342 --> 28:57.914
You must retrieve
your grubby letters from him

28:57.939 --> 29:00.027
and leave here at once.

29:00.189 --> 29:02.988
My intention
was not to offend His Majesty.

29:03.292 --> 29:06.341
But you have not responded
to any of my appeals,

29:06.665 --> 29:09.048
there has been
no interest paid on the loan.

29:09.073 --> 29:10.646
I must have my money.

29:10.671 --> 29:14.202
I am giving you the chance to leave.
Why do you not go?

29:14.671 --> 29:15.975
What is going on, Feron?

29:16.000 --> 29:18.520
What exactly are you
trying to prove here?

29:18.980 --> 29:20.976
Perhaps I should speak to the King.

29:22.589 --> 29:24.108
You could just...

29:24.423 --> 29:27.475
pick up your letters and walk away.

29:35.261 --> 29:36.606
I gave you the chance.

29:48.207 --> 29:49.305
Here.

29:50.502 --> 29:51.502
Take a seat.

29:58.602 --> 29:59.692
Those men...

30:00.149 --> 30:01.644
We've gathered most of the prisoners,

30:01.645 --> 30:03.655
and will soon have the rest
back at the Chatelet.

30:03.665 --> 30:05.585
Those men, they weren't
from the Chatelet.

30:06.305 --> 30:07.315
What do you mean?

30:07.340 --> 30:09.328
No convict wears rings on every finger.

30:09.353 --> 30:11.998
One of them had fur around
his cuffs, I could feel it.

30:12.023 --> 30:13.402
Then who were they?

30:14.745 --> 30:16.705
What would they want with you?

30:16.715 --> 30:18.565
Well, my husband, I think...

30:18.590 --> 30:20.675
They were using me to get to Victor.

30:20.875 --> 30:24.875
He was once a locksmith for the King.
He designed locks for the royal vault.

30:26.665 --> 30:28.680
The King's gold reserves
are beneath the Chatelet.

30:30.924 --> 30:33.755
Please. Help save my husband.

30:36.647 --> 30:38.122
Thank you, Sisters.

30:53.658 --> 30:55.108
The voice in my head.

30:58.467 --> 31:00.982
It still hurts me.

31:05.331 --> 31:07.371
You can rest here.

31:08.165 --> 31:10.285
The Sisters will look after you.

31:15.737 --> 31:17.597
Excellent.

31:30.244 --> 31:33.334
I will make you a comte for this.

31:36.293 --> 31:37.293
Hmm.

31:48.273 --> 31:49.808
I need more lead.

31:50.353 --> 31:52.392
I can't do it without more lead.

31:52.393 --> 31:55.413
Where are we supposed to get the lead?
From the roof?

31:55.714 --> 31:58.301
Your round. Give me your shot.

32:00.263 --> 32:02.243
I can't put the elements
together without it.

32:02.253 --> 32:05.363
You think by wasting more time
you can save your wife.

32:06.141 --> 32:08.271
No lead, no key.

32:10.283 --> 32:11.606
Give him what he wants.

32:11.631 --> 32:12.721
Quickly!

32:14.096 --> 32:15.700
Finish the job.

32:27.935 --> 32:29.363
Why did you let him go?

32:29.373 --> 32:32.866
I couldn't send him back to the Chatelet.
He's not a well man.

32:33.136 --> 32:34.635
- Hmm?
- I felt for him.

32:36.343 --> 32:38.403
You weren't at the
Siege of Salas, Porthos.

32:42.579 --> 32:43.858
What happened?

32:44.923 --> 32:49.413
The Spanish had that town
surrounded for almost a year.

32:49.423 --> 32:53.179
And the people defending it were
driven to eating dogs, rats...

32:53.204 --> 32:54.244
Yeah.

32:54.283 --> 32:55.679
And each other.

32:56.343 --> 32:57.913
If the rumours were true.

32:59.180 --> 33:01.260
And that's enough to make any man mad.

33:02.403 --> 33:04.263
I'd rather have starved.

33:04.273 --> 33:06.403
Well, you don't know
what you're talking about.

33:06.598 --> 33:07.824
Do you?

33:10.936 --> 33:11.936
Hey.

33:12.466 --> 33:14.336
You did the right thing.

33:17.567 --> 33:19.497
The midday bell!

33:22.763 --> 33:24.423
The Chatelet is secure now.

33:25.034 --> 33:27.762
Captain Marcheaux has ordered us
to escort the prisoners back.

33:27.787 --> 33:29.807
It's about time. Brujon.

33:31.363 --> 33:33.620
In case you need any more of our help.

33:34.806 --> 33:35.963
Good day.

33:36.851 --> 33:38.569
We've been played for fools.

33:38.871 --> 33:40.469
Quickly, we need to find Athos.

33:40.494 --> 33:42.843
They're stealing the King's
gold from under the Chatelet.

33:43.243 --> 33:44.393
You, get out!

33:49.111 --> 33:50.111
Mmm.

34:02.536 --> 34:03.825
Coming!

34:10.096 --> 34:12.596
- Governor?
- George.

34:14.545 --> 34:15.545
Get rid of them.

34:28.174 --> 34:29.455
What happened here?

34:30.591 --> 34:31.591
Oh, that?

34:32.670 --> 34:35.553
I had hoped it had been a dream.

34:37.179 --> 34:38.585
Van Laar...

34:38.868 --> 34:41.927
I will need you to dispose of him.

34:45.650 --> 34:47.120
The prisoners?

34:48.221 --> 34:50.558
The midday bell has been rung.

34:51.581 --> 34:53.701
They're being returned
to the Chatelet as instructed.

34:53.726 --> 34:55.652
We were supposed to delay it.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.109
I got no message.

34:58.134 --> 34:59.828
Grimaud needed time.

35:00.551 --> 35:03.285
They should only have been
returned at the evening bell.

35:04.281 --> 35:07.251
George, what have we done?

35:07.888 --> 35:09.905
They'll never be able to get out.

35:21.601 --> 35:22.601
It's done.

35:39.851 --> 35:41.720
Back to your cells, you vermin.

35:42.112 --> 35:43.152
No.

36:01.890 --> 36:03.118
Open the doors!

36:04.285 --> 36:06.129
The King's gold reserves
are under attack!

36:06.154 --> 36:07.595
No one in or out.

36:08.811 --> 36:10.731
They are bringing the prisoners back.

36:10.756 --> 36:11.806
It's too soon!

36:11.816 --> 36:14.178
If we don't get out now,
we'll be trapped in here.

36:16.980 --> 36:18.090
You failed me.

36:18.279 --> 36:21.650
I gave Governor Feron the message
just as you told me, I swear it.

36:37.476 --> 36:39.456
What do you mean to do with me now?

36:42.816 --> 36:44.696
I took your shot, remember?

36:49.617 --> 36:50.617
Musketeers!

36:51.816 --> 36:53.286
Hide!

37:01.565 --> 37:02.764
Lock this door.

37:26.571 --> 37:28.491
It's an escape route.

37:29.676 --> 37:31.041
Sit him up.

37:33.978 --> 37:35.626
Ah!

37:37.736 --> 37:38.736
Psst.

38:16.656 --> 38:17.656
Stop!

38:42.231 --> 38:43.545
Secure the Chatelet!

39:04.796 --> 39:05.932
Open the door!

39:08.246 --> 39:09.246
Easy, easy.

39:11.699 --> 39:13.165
All right. All right.

39:13.190 --> 39:15.776
All right. I'm gonna talk to
Minister Treville, all right?

39:15.938 --> 39:17.891
Try and get you out of here
and get you back to your wife.

39:18.332 --> 39:20.835
Everything the man told me
turned out to be true.

39:20.860 --> 39:22.675
The gold, the robbery, everything.

39:22.700 --> 39:23.629
Look...

39:23.654 --> 39:25.362
- No?
- Gone.

39:25.372 --> 39:28.271
You're telling me a lunatic is going
to reveal who's behind all of this?

39:28.296 --> 39:29.296
Yes.

39:29.382 --> 39:32.552
Borel thinks he's the King.

39:33.177 --> 39:35.187
- Why? You know him?
- We shared a cell.

39:35.542 --> 39:37.362
Be careful with him.

39:37.372 --> 39:39.402
He seems harmless, but he's not.

39:39.412 --> 39:41.893
He murdered a jailor
in front of my eyes.

39:44.432 --> 39:45.462
The nuns.

39:54.303 --> 39:55.313
No...

39:55.367 --> 39:56.517
No, no, no.

39:59.492 --> 40:01.502
What have I done?

40:01.512 --> 40:03.864
My friend, we're too late for them.

40:04.278 --> 40:07.208
We need to find Borel
to stop this happening again.

40:07.233 --> 40:09.056
He knows about the Dauphin's party.

40:32.422 --> 40:35.382
The King is determined
the party will go ahead.

40:35.392 --> 40:37.778
We need to find this man
quickly and quietly.

40:37.803 --> 40:41.805
Captain Marcheaux, have your men
search the palace and the grounds.

40:41.830 --> 40:44.209
- This man, Borel, is dangerous.
- Yes.

40:44.234 --> 40:45.288
He wouldn't be at large

40:45.313 --> 40:47.142
if you and your men had done
a better job at the Chatelet.

40:47.167 --> 40:50.322
He's already killed
three today. Perhaps more.

40:53.382 --> 40:57.112
Well, you... You can stay here.
I've got this.

40:57.261 --> 40:59.421
You don't need to
see the Queen or the Dauphin.

40:59.853 --> 41:02.631
But if you're going, it's my duty.

41:06.362 --> 41:08.114
We shouldn't be doing this.

41:08.362 --> 41:11.511
The Musketeers are here, Majesty.
You're well protected.

41:11.874 --> 41:14.566
It's not our safety
that concerns me, Treville.

41:15.693 --> 41:18.668
What kind of message does all
of this send to the people?

41:19.357 --> 41:21.558
That the King loves his son.

41:22.237 --> 41:26.187
And will spend more time indulging
him than feeding his subjects.

41:37.730 --> 41:40.593
How about you and D'Artagnan
search the gardens?

41:41.691 --> 41:43.566
The King awaits.

41:44.105 --> 41:45.105
Captain.

41:52.262 --> 41:54.301
I've put the royal family at risk.

41:54.326 --> 41:55.572
No, you haven't.

41:55.597 --> 41:58.958
You couldn't have measured the
full consequences of your actions.

41:58.983 --> 42:00.535
Believe me, I know.

42:01.927 --> 42:03.965
Your intentions were good.

42:04.241 --> 42:05.990
That's what matters.

42:06.393 --> 42:08.443
Now let's find this madman.

42:16.433 --> 42:18.523
Well, it's not much of a throne, is it?

42:28.095 --> 42:29.135
Mmm.

42:36.356 --> 42:39.100
No! No, no, no.

42:39.290 --> 42:40.330
No!

42:58.272 --> 42:59.272
Hmm?

43:01.423 --> 43:02.443
Oh, yes.

43:04.719 --> 43:05.749
Hmm?

43:06.028 --> 43:07.271
Thank you.

43:09.307 --> 43:10.357
Thank you.

43:25.484 --> 43:29.276
My son, I can barely believe it,

43:29.781 --> 43:33.805
has reached this most important of
milestones in a young boy's life.

43:34.433 --> 43:36.332
His sixth birthday.

43:45.403 --> 43:47.763
Such an important day reminds us

43:47.958 --> 43:51.623
of the destiny of every firstborn
son in the House of Bourbon.

43:53.209 --> 43:55.328
My boy will one day be your king.

43:55.353 --> 43:56.533
Excuse me.

43:57.054 --> 43:59.142
Your many tributes are touching.

44:00.214 --> 44:01.935
But you must show me

44:02.615 --> 44:04.675
that you love my son

44:05.040 --> 44:06.573
as I love him.

44:08.323 --> 44:09.791
And swear your loyalty.

44:11.363 --> 44:15.894
First, Philippe Feron,
Governor of Paris.

44:30.997 --> 44:32.014
I,

44:33.686 --> 44:34.976
Philippe Feron,

44:35.722 --> 44:37.705
pledge my loyalty

44:38.324 --> 44:41.810
to the boy with the purest blood

44:42.215 --> 44:43.657
in the whole of France.

44:53.725 --> 44:55.253
He's embarrassing our son.

44:55.686 --> 44:57.142
Can't you see he's ill?

44:58.253 --> 44:59.293
Uncle.

45:02.473 --> 45:04.438
I pledge my loyalty

45:05.104 --> 45:07.364
to the future King of France.

45:15.245 --> 45:17.049
May God forgive me.

45:23.373 --> 45:24.453
Thank you, Philippe.

45:27.820 --> 45:29.003
I need a moment.

45:29.756 --> 45:30.907
Alone.

45:31.323 --> 45:33.373
I can't bear this spectacle any longer.

45:33.383 --> 45:34.503
Well, hurry back.

45:36.373 --> 45:38.333
We still have the presents.

45:49.212 --> 45:50.533
Do we know who this is?

45:52.529 --> 45:54.599
Van Laar, the Dutch financier.

45:54.624 --> 45:57.313
Borel's here in the palace.

46:22.656 --> 46:24.403
Don't, don't, don't.

46:24.413 --> 46:26.373
Don't you know your real husband,

46:26.842 --> 46:28.196
my dear?

46:29.254 --> 46:31.294
I have come back for you.

46:33.691 --> 46:34.691
Who are you?

46:36.767 --> 46:39.614
- What are you doing in here?
- Shh. We must be careful.

46:41.200 --> 46:43.016
There are imposters
at the palace, you know.

46:44.181 --> 46:45.316
And one of them...

46:47.230 --> 46:48.503
...he whispers to me,

46:48.513 --> 46:49.996
and he won't stop.

46:52.975 --> 46:54.765
And he thinks

46:55.548 --> 46:56.967
that he's the King.

46:57.737 --> 46:58.737
Not me.

47:05.568 --> 47:06.568
Well,

47:09.313 --> 47:10.356
we must find him.

47:13.869 --> 47:15.669
Perhaps in the grounds.

47:19.050 --> 47:20.939
- The grounds?
- Mmm-hmm.

47:23.065 --> 47:24.075
Mmm.

47:24.311 --> 47:25.370
Yeah.

47:27.333 --> 47:28.692
I will find

47:29.353 --> 47:32.015
that creature that's
calling himself the King,

47:33.305 --> 47:35.355
and I'll cut out his heart.

47:38.383 --> 47:41.493
Surely as King,
you might show a little mercy.

47:46.463 --> 47:47.955
I can hear the whispers.

47:51.473 --> 47:53.483
You are against me, aren't you?

47:59.453 --> 48:00.909
What have we got?

48:01.363 --> 48:04.323
The Queen, she's not in her quarters.

48:04.453 --> 48:05.503
She's missing.

48:09.396 --> 48:11.332
If you have a shot, take it.

48:12.134 --> 48:15.783
You knew, you knew
he put me into that place.

48:18.323 --> 48:20.452
You let him get inside
of my head, didn't you?

48:20.680 --> 48:21.730
No, no, you're wrong.

48:21.818 --> 48:24.016
Now you must calm down.
We can talk this through.

48:24.041 --> 48:25.056
We can talk this through.

48:25.081 --> 48:27.116
- Stop!
- Even my Queen

48:27.805 --> 48:28.845
is against me.

48:28.870 --> 48:31.478
She's not the Queen.
She's not the Queen!

48:32.081 --> 48:33.280
She's an imposter.

48:36.620 --> 48:38.629
No, no, no. You're trying to trick me.

48:38.654 --> 48:41.772
- No. I swear it. She is.
- What?

48:42.483 --> 48:44.816
What? She's what?

48:44.841 --> 48:45.841
She's mine.

48:46.794 --> 48:47.794
Oh.

48:49.252 --> 48:50.489
Now I know you're lying.

48:51.738 --> 48:53.874
- She must die.
- No!

48:55.719 --> 48:56.943
D'Artagnan!

48:59.360 --> 49:00.473
My comte.

49:34.736 --> 49:35.744
What is this?

49:35.769 --> 49:38.597
Your Majesty, an intruder found
his way into the palace.

49:38.622 --> 49:40.642
- He has been dispatched.
- Get away from her.

49:44.905 --> 49:46.736
Are you hurt? Summon a physician.

49:46.761 --> 49:48.343
I am unharmed.

49:49.294 --> 49:51.334
Thanks to the Musketeers.

50:14.013 --> 50:15.447
Treville.

50:16.882 --> 50:20.933
If I get lost, they need only
ask you where to find me.

50:21.386 --> 50:22.466
Do sit down.

50:29.484 --> 50:32.004
You heard about the attempted
robbery on the vault?

50:32.029 --> 50:34.138
Oh. Shocking, wasn't it?

50:34.524 --> 50:38.027
And all the time, we were at
the Dauphin's birthday party,

50:38.240 --> 50:39.280
oblivious.

50:41.001 --> 50:43.999
Once again, the Red Guards
saw and suspected nothing.

50:45.433 --> 50:48.720
Something rotten is at work here,
Feron, and I know who's behind it.

50:53.594 --> 50:56.135
Say anything to the King,

50:56.945 --> 51:00.724
and I'll have his secret
spread halfway across Europe

51:01.178 --> 51:02.464
before nightfall.

51:04.302 --> 51:05.351
What secret?

51:08.554 --> 51:11.135
The King is dying,

51:11.979 --> 51:14.674
which leaves
a six-year-old on the throne

51:14.887 --> 51:16.204
and possibly

51:16.229 --> 51:18.590
a Spanish queen as Regent

51:18.614 --> 51:21.183
when we are at war with Spain.

51:22.043 --> 51:25.177
Just think of the damage,
if that gets out.

51:25.456 --> 51:27.244
Riots in the city,

51:27.474 --> 51:29.119
armies at the gates.

51:30.147 --> 51:32.306
Breathe one word,

51:32.584 --> 51:36.272
and I'll bring
everything you hold most dear

51:36.297 --> 51:37.484
crashing down.

52:15.012 --> 52:16.887
Today is a day I'd rather forget.

52:19.544 --> 52:21.772
Treville knows
Feron is behind all of this.

52:21.797 --> 52:23.534
Why won't he just go to the King?

52:23.544 --> 52:24.634
And say what?

52:25.386 --> 52:27.790
The loan documents were
destroyed, Van Laar is dead.

52:27.815 --> 52:28.946
He's still a traitor.

52:28.971 --> 52:30.450
He wasn't acting alone.

52:33.444 --> 52:35.691
I shot a sick and desperate man today.

52:37.474 --> 52:39.059
Who wanted to kill the Queen.

52:41.314 --> 52:44.374
Why do I feel like I'm
fighting for the wrong side?

52:57.534 --> 52:58.687
Where are you going?

54:22.594 --> 54:24.454
I should kill you now.

54:24.464 --> 54:28.012
It was not me who ruined our plans.

54:28.268 --> 54:30.864
- It was the Musketeers.
- There will be no army.

54:30.889 --> 54:34.123
The King will die, and we have no
means to take advantage of it.

54:34.148 --> 54:35.821
We still have Gaston.

54:36.050 --> 54:37.682
We still have his allies.

54:39.038 --> 54:40.624
You need me, Grimaud.

54:40.634 --> 54:43.594
Gaston will not deal with you alone.

54:44.614 --> 54:46.311
Oh.

54:46.709 --> 54:47.803
Yes.

54:48.362 --> 54:49.698
And the Musketeers?

54:50.432 --> 54:51.615
Those four

54:52.484 --> 54:54.221
will not stand in my way again.
