14:30.125 --> 14:32.125
Other fun facts, too.

14:32.208 --> 14:33.291
For example,

14:33.375 --> 14:35.333
hanging yourself
with a guitar string?

14:35.417 --> 14:37.250
Really bad way
to kill yourself.

14:37.333 --> 14:39.458
I saw this guy
who tried it, and first,

14:39.542 --> 14:40.875
the string cut
through his trachea,

14:40.959 --> 14:43.208
but it didn't kill him,
so he started fighting it,

14:43.291 --> 14:45.083
and that severed
his carotid artery,

14:45.166 --> 14:46.458
and followed
the angle of the jaw,

14:46.542 --> 14:48.041
cutting everything
along the way,

14:48.125 --> 14:49.959
all the way to the temporal
bone, and still,

14:50.041 --> 14:52.041
it took a while
for him to die.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.625
Air embolism.

14:58.208 --> 15:01.083
I also learned that
what you see in movies,

15:01.166 --> 15:03.291
when someone gets shot
and everybody rushes

15:03.375 --> 15:05.083
to take
the bullet out...

15:05.834 --> 15:07.417
Worst idea.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.875
What's important is
to clean the wound

15:09.959 --> 15:11.208
and repair the damage.

15:11.291 --> 15:13.709
Taking the bullet out is
the least important thing,

15:13.792 --> 15:17.083
as it may be acting as
a sterilizer for the wound.

-What happened?
-I got shot.

45:07.583 --> 45:09.166
-You got shot?
-A shot.

45:09.250 --> 45:11.291
I got a shot at the doctor's.
