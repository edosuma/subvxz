Have a drink.

36:23.223 --> 36:25.558
Whoa, cowboy, it's not even 10:00 a.m.

36:29.688 --> 36:30.855
Have a drink with me, Deke.

36:35.068 --> 36:36.069
Okay.

36:43.910 --> 36:44.911
You know...

36:47.664 --> 36:50.041
I think you're the best damn pilot
in this whole program.

36:52.961 --> 36:54.629
If it was up to me, you'd be first.

36:55.505 --> 36:57.006
But it wasn't up to you, I know that.

37:07.183 --> 37:08.309
What's going on, Chris?

37:22.574 --> 37:24.909
(SIGHS) Something's come up.

37:26.953 --> 37:28.163
Something that's, um...

37:30.665 --> 37:32.208
-it's concerning.
-Chris.

37:34.836 --> 37:35.920
It's your arrhythmia.

37:37.547 --> 37:38.757
Wiesner's guys found it

37:39.048 --> 37:41.843
when they were going through
everyone's medical records.

37:43.219 --> 37:46.181
The arrhythmia, no, that's...
that's not a problem.

37:47.182 --> 37:49.476
The Air Force surgeons cleared me
for that years ago.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.313
They, um...

37:54.981 --> 37:56.232
they think it's too risky.

38:01.529 --> 38:02.614
Too risky for now?

38:04.908 --> 38:06.868
Too risky, period.

38:13.541 --> 38:14.667
They're grounding you, Deke.

38:19.964 --> 38:20.965
That's it?

38:26.054 --> 38:28.264
I threw away my commission
to join this program.

38:28.765 --> 38:29.891
Jesus Christ.

38:31.726 --> 38:32.727
I understand.

38:35.563 --> 38:39.150
-And we're gonna find a place for you.
-Oh. A place?

38:39.776 --> 38:42.153
We're gonna find something
for you to do here.

39:06.845 --> 39:07.846
Chris.

39:11.891 --> 39:13.393
Don't let them do this. I mean...

39:14.602 --> 39:15.645
you're my friend.

39:18.314 --> 39:21.568
I just... I bought... I bought a house.
Marge got a Buick.

39:26.906 --> 39:28.032
You can fix this.

39:29.534 --> 39:31.870
You can tell them, you can tell Bob,

39:32.787 --> 39:34.372
tell him... tell him what you said,

39:34.873 --> 39:36.875
that you would have sent me up first.

39:39.085 --> 39:42.213
-That was before, Deke.
-Tell them what you think is best.

39:48.177 --> 39:49.178
This...

39:51.890 --> 39:52.932
is best, Deke.

40:15.997 --> 40:17.165
Aren't you gonna open it?

40:37.393 --> 40:38.394
It's a gravy boat.

40:42.732 --> 40:45.443
The lady at the shop
called it a, uh... saucier.

41:10.009 --> 41:11.010
Hello, this is Shorty.

41:13.096 --> 41:14.097
What?

41:15.765 --> 41:16.808
Wait.

41:17.141 --> 41:20.770
(GROANS) Wait. Slow down, slow down.
We're all asleep down here.

41:26.025 --> 41:27.151
Are you joking?

41:52.510 --> 41:55.054
-What's going on?
-It's the Russians.

41:56.305 --> 41:59.142
I'm sorry, guys. They put a man in orbit.

42:01.728 --> 42:02.729
Dammit.

42:06.816 --> 42:07.817
(SIGHS)

42:15.033 --> 42:16.617
All right, what do we do now?

42:21.289 --> 42:22.331
I don't know.
