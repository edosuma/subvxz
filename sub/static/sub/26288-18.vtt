WEBVTT

00:03.304 --> 00:05.137
I want those codes.

00:05.206 --> 00:07.506
Those nuclear codes
will do you no good.

00:07.575 --> 00:08.986
Pentagon would've
changed them by now.

00:09.010 --> 00:12.144
Hi, hey, everybody.
It's good to be back.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.446
Shoot.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.015
I'll get that for you.

00:16.082 --> 00:18.250
What happened to you?
On-the-job injury.

00:18.319 --> 00:20.152
How would you like to, um,

00:20.221 --> 00:22.121
see each other? I'd like that.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.523
Nice work.

00:24.592 --> 00:25.958
What's your assessment?

00:26.027 --> 00:27.826
Don't know yet.

00:27.895 --> 00:28.927
But I will.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.295
Officer Clark.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.264
Call me Westley.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.366
The CIA appreciates
your cooperation.

00:34.435 --> 00:35.701
Be careful of this guy, okay?

00:35.770 --> 00:37.870
Director Vance.
Secretary Crawford.

00:37.938 --> 00:40.272
I understand you've been
tracking Leon Vance.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.307
No idea
what you're talking about.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.476
I want everything you have.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

01:13.307 --> 01:15.541
Honey? What's-what's going on?

01:16.777 --> 01:19.645
I just woke up and realized...

01:19.713 --> 01:22.247
I left my purse out in the car.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.428
You should have asked me to
go out and get it for you.

01:24.452 --> 01:26.351
Well, I didn't want to wake you.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.687
Yeah, but it's-it's
cold outside.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.222
So...

01:30.291 --> 01:33.158
come back to bed and warm me up.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.094
I like the way you think.

01:35.162 --> 01:36.662
Come on.

02:08.195 --> 02:09.695
What up? It's Nick.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.241
Leave your message,
and I'll hit you back.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.731
Hey.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.633
It's me. Again.

02:14.702 --> 02:17.436
You need to hit me back, ASAP.

02:17.505 --> 02:21.273
Or, better yet,
just get your ass into work.

02:21.342 --> 02:24.076
Morning, Bishop. How's it going?

02:24.145 --> 02:25.744
Hey, have you seen Torres?

02:25.813 --> 02:28.313
Um, I'm doing fine.
Thank you for asking.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.327
Okay, McGee, I just saw you,
like, eight hours ago.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.317
Do we really need to debrief
every single morning?

02:32.386 --> 02:33.752
I guess not.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.721
Have you seen Torres?

02:35.789 --> 02:37.656
Actually, no. We did have plans

02:37.725 --> 02:41.326
to have breakfast at the diner,
but, um, he stood me up.

02:42.696 --> 02:43.929
What?

02:43.964 --> 02:45.597
Nothing. Nick and I decided

02:45.633 --> 02:47.499
we'd come in early
to knock out some of these.

02:47.535 --> 02:50.169
ROls before work,
but he bailed on me, too.

02:50.237 --> 02:52.471
How many times
did you try calling him?

02:52.540 --> 02:54.273
13.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.675
I know. I just,
I really hate paperwork.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.310
No judgments.

02:58.379 --> 03:01.413
It's just, it's not like Nick
to blow us off like this.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.515
Straight to voice mail.

03:03.584 --> 03:04.917
What do we do?

03:04.985 --> 03:06.785
Not overreact.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.188
It's Torres.
I'm-I'm sure he's got a story.

03:09.256 --> 03:10.989
Yeah. Better be a good one.

03:11.058 --> 03:13.258
Called him this morning.

03:13.327 --> 03:16.028
He didn't call back.
It doesn't sound like Nick.

03:16.096 --> 03:17.629
You call him?

03:17.698 --> 03:19.998
13 times, apparently.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.366
Ping his phone.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.834
I'm on it right now.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.104
I got a location.

03:30.678 --> 03:31.977
That's odd.

03:32.046 --> 03:33.712
Very.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.816
Virginia Beach?
That's three hours away.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.351
Let's go.

04:51.358 --> 04:53.625
Rough night, Torres?

05:03.491 --> 05:06.558
How the hell did I get here?

05:06.627 --> 05:07.926
You asking me?

05:07.995 --> 05:11.029
Actually, I don't even
know where here is.

05:11.098 --> 05:12.698
Apex Marina.

05:12.767 --> 05:14.066
Virginia Beach?

05:14.135 --> 05:16.702
Man, what happened to me?

05:16.771 --> 05:18.704
Are these rhetorical questions?

05:18.773 --> 05:21.707
Gibbs. My head is killing me.

05:21.776 --> 05:23.408
What'd you have to
drink last night?

05:23.477 --> 05:25.277
No booze, nothing. Nick.

05:25.346 --> 05:29.248
No, Gibbs, I-I promise you.
I-I had zero drops of alcohol.

05:29.316 --> 05:32.251
I-I've been doing, I've been
doing much better with that.

05:32.319 --> 05:34.052
What's the last thing
you remember?

05:34.121 --> 05:36.355
I remember leaving the office
to go to the gym,

05:36.423 --> 05:37.756
like I do every Monday.

05:37.825 --> 05:39.224
And then?

05:39.293 --> 05:42.461
And then I remember
stretching, starting my cardio,

05:42.530 --> 05:44.797
and...

05:44.865 --> 05:46.799
nothing after that.

05:46.867 --> 05:49.468
Drink. You're dehydrated.

05:54.975 --> 05:57.609
This is so messed up.

05:57.678 --> 05:59.978
I feel like I was... Drugged.

06:00.047 --> 06:03.549
Drugged. But by who and why?

06:03.617 --> 06:06.418
Check your wallet.

06:07.521 --> 06:09.221
All the cash is here.

06:09.290 --> 06:10.522
Dock master says

06:10.591 --> 06:12.424
the boat's been
abandoned here for months.

06:12.493 --> 06:14.459
They're still
sorting out ownership.

06:14.528 --> 06:16.706
You rode your motorcycle to
the office yesterday, right?

06:16.730 --> 06:19.231
Right. I, um...

06:19.300 --> 06:21.433
Then I-I rode it to the gym.

06:21.502 --> 06:23.335
Why? Is she not here?

06:24.705 --> 06:25.985
Then how the hell
did I get here?

06:26.040 --> 06:28.340
Again, you're asking us?

06:28.409 --> 06:30.909
Hey. Found this
under the mattress.

06:32.012 --> 06:34.012
What you got?

06:34.081 --> 06:35.681
It's a broken saw blade,
I think.

06:35.749 --> 06:38.083
But that's not the most
disturbing thing I found.

06:41.088 --> 06:43.121
Wait, why's my T-shirt
in the evidence bag?

06:43.190 --> 06:45.858
Because it's splattered
in blood.

06:45.926 --> 06:48.026
Am I cut?

06:48.095 --> 06:49.962
So who's blood is it?

06:50.030 --> 06:52.331
That is not a
rhetorical question.

06:52.399 --> 06:54.700
Your gym.

06:54.768 --> 06:56.802
You see anybody there
last night?

06:59.039 --> 07:01.173
I was supposed to meet
my trainer, Jordan,

07:01.242 --> 07:03.475
but I... I don't think
I saw him.

07:03.544 --> 07:06.111
Bishop, with me.
McGee, get him back.

07:06.180 --> 07:07.512
Have Palmer take a look at him.

07:07.581 --> 07:11.183
Hey, Gibbs, don't bench me, man.
Just give me...

07:11.252 --> 07:12.818
Water. Drink it.

07:15.356 --> 07:18.357
Give me something to do.

07:20.361 --> 07:22.861
Hey, Leon. Hey, Jack,
you got a minute?

07:22.930 --> 07:24.563
Sure. What's up?

07:24.632 --> 07:27.165
I need your opinion
on something.

07:28.936 --> 07:31.003
Something or someone?

07:31.071 --> 07:32.671
What's the latest?

07:32.740 --> 07:36.708
I think it's time to take things
to the next level.

07:39.146 --> 07:41.346
Is that what I think it is?

07:45.286 --> 07:46.919
Wow.

07:46.987 --> 07:48.654
She's a beauty.

07:48.722 --> 07:51.023
May I? Sure.

07:59.833 --> 08:01.700
Too much?

08:01.769 --> 08:03.335
Please.

08:03.404 --> 08:05.671
No jewelry is ever too much.
Always remember that.

08:05.739 --> 08:08.573
This is the piece
you told me about?

08:09.944 --> 08:11.610
They did nice work.

08:11.679 --> 08:13.078
Ruby red.

08:13.147 --> 08:17.849
The color of passion,
love, desire and danger.

08:17.918 --> 08:20.385
Okay, you can save
your chakra colors mumbo-jumbo

08:20.454 --> 08:21.954
for the field agents, Jack.

08:22.022 --> 08:25.357
Hey. Take a look
at your lollipop, please.

08:27.962 --> 08:29.895
This is more of a magenta.

08:31.031 --> 08:32.965
Thanks, Jack.

08:33.033 --> 08:35.067
Okay, good.

08:35.135 --> 08:38.035
Now the other one.

08:38.105 --> 08:40.405
See? I told you I was fine.

08:40.474 --> 08:42.474
We should let the doctor decide.

08:42.543 --> 08:44.076
You have very
striking eyes, Nick.

08:44.144 --> 08:46.244
Anyone ever tell you that? Yes.

08:48.882 --> 08:50.582
Well, there's no
apparent head trauma,

08:50.651 --> 08:52.818
so I think we can
rule out a concussion.

08:52.886 --> 08:54.586
There you go. You happy, McGee?

08:54.655 --> 08:56.154
However,

08:56.223 --> 08:59.424
11 hours of total memory loss
is a serious medical condition.

08:59.493 --> 09:02.294
One that requires
extensive examination,

09:02.363 --> 09:04.229
testing. I was drugged.

09:04.298 --> 09:06.465
Test is over. So you say.

09:06.533 --> 09:08.967
But you still can't tell me
exactly what happened.

09:09.036 --> 09:10.235
Because I was drugged.

09:10.304 --> 09:12.604
Perhaps, but there are a lot of

09:12.673 --> 09:15.474
other explanations, Nick,
including epilepsy, stroke.

09:15.542 --> 09:16.742
Could be a tumor.

09:16.810 --> 09:18.910
Torreses don't tumor.

09:18.979 --> 09:20.245
Afraid of needles, Nick?

09:21.648 --> 09:23.015
Not afraid of needles, noted.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.616
Elbow on the table.

09:24.685 --> 09:26.018
All right.

09:26.086 --> 09:27.753
You're gonna feel
a little prick.

09:27.821 --> 09:29.788
Hey. Found this in my go bag.

09:29.857 --> 09:31.189
Not a chance.

09:31.258 --> 09:32.524
I thought you wanted a shirt.

09:32.593 --> 09:34.193
Yeah, but not in exchange
for my dignity.

09:34.261 --> 09:36.428
All right,
I'll run those up to Kasie.

09:36.497 --> 09:38.657
Nick, you get dressed.
I'll meet you back here in five.

09:38.699 --> 09:41.299
We'll start poring over
your cell phone data,

09:41.368 --> 09:43.246
see if we can build a timeline
and retrace your steps.

09:43.270 --> 09:44.302
Sounds good.

09:47.408 --> 09:49.975
Here you go. Hold that on there.

09:50.044 --> 09:51.309
Wasn't so bad?

09:53.680 --> 09:55.480
Where you going?

09:55.549 --> 09:57.349
Hey, hey, hey. I'm serious.

09:57.418 --> 09:59.451
You are not
to leave this building.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.053
Doctor's orders.

10:06.126 --> 10:08.994
This is why I prefer
working on dead people.

10:09.063 --> 10:12.898
Hey. So, gym surveillance
footage is digital

10:12.966 --> 10:15.200
on an off-site server.

10:15.269 --> 10:17.569
Management is working on
getting us access.

10:17.638 --> 10:19.638
That's management?

10:19.706 --> 10:21.073
Yeah. That is Trevor.

10:21.141 --> 10:24.142
He said Jordan
is doing bag work.

10:24.211 --> 10:25.588
- Hard, hard, hard.
- Good, good, good.

10:25.612 --> 10:27.079
Gibbs.

10:27.147 --> 10:29.081
I just got another text
from the woman

10:29.149 --> 10:31.016
who rented Ziva
her private office.

10:31.085 --> 10:34.386
Really? Bishop, we're gonna
talk about that now?

10:34.455 --> 10:36.221
I know, I know.
But she keeps texting me.

10:36.290 --> 10:38.390
She wants you to clear out
the rest of Ziva's things.

10:38.459 --> 10:40.358
I just didn't get around to it.

10:40.427 --> 10:45.664
Look, I know it's not easy,
seeing Ziva's stuff.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.666
I can take care of it. No.

10:47.734 --> 10:50.769
No, I said I'll do it.
I'll do it.

10:57.411 --> 10:59.344
You do it.

10:59.413 --> 11:02.881
Okay. No problem.

11:02.950 --> 11:04.516
Jordan?

11:04.585 --> 11:06.118
Jordan.

11:06.186 --> 11:08.520
Let's go.
Do work, brother. Come on!

11:08.589 --> 11:10.956
Come on! Put the hips into it.

11:11.024 --> 11:12.302
Three left, three left,
three left.

11:12.326 --> 11:14.292
Hands up, hands up.
Jordan Peralta?

11:16.330 --> 11:18.430
All right, why don't you
grab some water.

11:20.334 --> 11:21.900
Is Nick okay?

11:21.969 --> 11:24.236
Yeah, he's fine. We just
have a couple questions

11:24.304 --> 11:25.637
to ask you about last night.

11:25.706 --> 11:28.907
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Whatever you need.

11:28.976 --> 11:30.542
You must be Ellie.

11:30.611 --> 11:32.577
Special Agent Bishop.

11:32.646 --> 11:34.779
Sorry, it's just that
I feel like I know you.

11:34.848 --> 11:36.615
Nick's a bit of a
chatterbug, you know?

11:36.683 --> 11:39.551
But he's said nothing but
good things, believe me.

11:39.620 --> 11:41.631
In fact, he said you really been
coming along lately.

11:41.655 --> 11:44.556
I'm sorry? "Coming along"?

11:47.060 --> 11:48.126
You must be Gibbs.

11:49.196 --> 11:50.595
Yep. Definitely Gibbs.

11:50.664 --> 11:53.498
You trained Torres last night?

11:53.567 --> 11:55.467
Actually, no. I was supposed to,

11:55.536 --> 11:57.435
but there was an accident
at Columbus Plaza.

11:57.504 --> 11:59.048
Called to tell him I was
gonna be a little late.

11:59.072 --> 12:00.639
How'd he sound?

12:00.707 --> 12:02.908
Same old Nick.
Like a tiger ready to pounce.

12:02.976 --> 12:04.176
Said he was gonna wait for me,

12:04.211 --> 12:05.488
but when I got
here, he was gone.

12:05.512 --> 12:07.812
So you never actually saw him?

12:07.881 --> 12:10.348
No. I tried calling him
for, like, an hour or so.

12:10.417 --> 12:11.783
He never got back to me.

12:11.852 --> 12:14.085
Figured something
must have come up.

12:14.154 --> 12:16.621
But it's not like him
to skip bi's and tri's day.

12:18.759 --> 12:20.592
So Torres blacks out,
we don't know why. Yep.

12:20.661 --> 12:22.994
Then he leaves the gym,
we don't know how. Yeah.

12:23.063 --> 12:24.696
And somehow,
he gets blood on his shirt,

12:24.765 --> 12:26.198
and we don't know whose. Yep.

12:26.266 --> 12:28.366
Sounds like a typical Tuesday.

12:28.435 --> 12:32.204
Okay, so Nick's bike
is blue, right?

12:32.272 --> 12:35.640
I don't know. Black, maybe?
I don't know.

12:35.709 --> 12:37.175
I think that was the old one.

12:37.244 --> 12:39.211
Why don't we ask him.

12:39.279 --> 12:41.379
What's he doing here?

12:41.415 --> 12:43.315
Torres.

12:43.350 --> 12:44.716
What are you doing?

12:44.785 --> 12:46.484
I'm looking,
I'm looking for my bike.

12:46.553 --> 12:49.988
I... know, I know
I parked it here.

12:50.057 --> 12:52.724
Hey. You shouldn't be here.

12:52.793 --> 12:55.126
I'm fine, I'm fine. Jimmy said.

12:55.195 --> 12:56.828
Really?

12:56.897 --> 12:59.798
Okay, well, your shirt
says otherwise.

12:59.866 --> 13:00.966
It's a choice.

13:02.636 --> 13:06.004
Look, I appreciate the concern,
guys, but what happened to me

13:06.073 --> 13:09.507
last night, that's not
your problem, it's mine.

13:09.576 --> 13:11.476
Have your keys?

13:11.545 --> 13:12.644
I'm sorry?

13:12.713 --> 13:14.980
Do you have the keys
to your motorcycle?

13:15.048 --> 13:16.982
Yeah, yeah.

13:24.224 --> 13:25.224
Betty?

13:26.593 --> 13:27.692
Betty?

13:27.761 --> 13:30.228
Why is my alarm

13:30.297 --> 13:32.364
chirping from a dumpster?

13:32.432 --> 13:33.832
God.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.100
God.

13:38.739 --> 13:41.239
God.

13:41.308 --> 13:42.841
God. Lord.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.509
Let this buff out.

13:48.015 --> 13:49.347
Bishop.

14:02.796 --> 14:05.297
You got to be kidding me.

14:10.496 --> 14:12.095
We I.D.'d the victim

14:12.197 --> 14:14.131
as 27-year-old Jessica Ho.

14:14.199 --> 14:16.133
She's a cocktail waitress
in Georgetown.

14:16.201 --> 14:17.868
Record? Yeah.

14:17.936 --> 14:19.669
Drug possession,
writing bad checks,

14:19.738 --> 14:22.105
probation violation, et cetera.

14:22.174 --> 14:24.007
Torres?

14:24.076 --> 14:26.209
You sure you don't know her?

14:27.780 --> 14:30.647
Well, she doesn't
belong to your gym.

14:30.716 --> 14:33.350
She used one of those
one-day free passes.

14:33.418 --> 14:35.218
But time stamp puts her

14:35.287 --> 14:38.488
there at the same time
as you last night, so...

14:38.557 --> 14:41.224
So what, McGee?

14:43.095 --> 14:44.739
I just said I don't know
who this woman is.

14:44.763 --> 14:46.363
I've never met her before,

14:46.431 --> 14:48.665
and I don't know how
she ended up dead under my bike.

14:50.035 --> 14:51.168
Palmer.

14:51.236 --> 14:53.537
Single gunshot wound
to the neck.

14:53.605 --> 14:55.472
Severed her carotid artery.

14:55.541 --> 14:57.174
That was that.

14:57.242 --> 14:59.020
Anything else? Yeah, there
was very little blood

14:59.044 --> 15:01.011
at the crime scene. My guess...

15:01.079 --> 15:02.479
- Body was moved.
- Hey.

15:02.548 --> 15:04.848
So I went down the rabbit hole
of trying to locate

15:04.917 --> 15:07.150
the owner of the fishing boat.
No luck.

15:07.219 --> 15:09.519
It's not registered?
No, it's registered.

15:09.588 --> 15:10.999
To three different owners
in three different countries.

15:11.023 --> 15:12.656
Coast Guard. I called them.

15:12.724 --> 15:14.191
Hopefully,
they'll have more info.

15:17.262 --> 15:19.529
Kasie's got your tox results.

15:19.598 --> 15:21.565
About time.

15:21.633 --> 15:23.600
I'll take the bullet.

15:31.243 --> 15:32.409
For real?

15:32.477 --> 15:34.578
For real.

15:37.482 --> 15:39.049
Come on.

15:45.023 --> 15:47.924
Dr. Mallard. Yeah,
thank you for calling me back.

15:47.993 --> 15:49.359
Kasie.

15:49.428 --> 15:51.361
Talk to me. Do you know

15:51.430 --> 15:53.930
how many tools humans have
invented to cut things?

15:53.999 --> 15:57.267
Saws, knives, chisels,
Chinese stars... ooh.

15:58.303 --> 15:59.569
Bullets.

15:59.638 --> 16:00.638
Kasie?

16:01.607 --> 16:02.639
My tox screen.

16:02.708 --> 16:04.875
The mystery blade

16:04.943 --> 16:06.943
you found on the boat
came back negative for DNA,

16:07.012 --> 16:09.212
so it's not the murder weapon.

16:09.281 --> 16:12.215
Right. I'm testing the
metal alloys now.

16:12.284 --> 16:14.417
Alloys, by the way,
are super fascinating,

16:14.486 --> 16:17.554
and I will tell you
about that another time.

16:17.623 --> 16:19.055
'Cause you're about
to tell us...

16:19.124 --> 16:22.392
All about the victim's
smashed up cell phone.

16:24.463 --> 16:25.662
Yeah, I mean,

16:25.731 --> 16:28.331
Even if I managed
to fix this puppy,

16:28.400 --> 16:30.166
I still got to figure out
a way to bypass

16:30.235 --> 16:31.968
the password protection...
Kasie.

16:32.037 --> 16:33.670
Yeah?

16:33.739 --> 16:35.572
It's okay. Gibbs sent us.

16:35.641 --> 16:37.574
Well, that makes everything

16:37.643 --> 16:39.776
way less awkward,
now, doesn't it?

16:39.845 --> 16:42.412
Okay, Nick, there is
a really good reason

16:42.481 --> 16:44.201
you don't remember
anything from last night.

16:44.249 --> 16:46.182
Actually, there's
four good reasons

16:46.251 --> 16:48.685
Alprazolam,
clonazepam, ketamine,

16:48.754 --> 16:52.923
and some mystery compound
I'm still working to I.D.

16:52.991 --> 16:55.659
Whoa. You were roofied.

16:55.727 --> 16:58.161
All right. I knew it.

16:58.230 --> 16:59.930
That's a, good thing?

16:59.998 --> 17:00.998
Yeah, it's a good thing.

17:01.033 --> 17:02.532
That means that I'm not crazy.

17:02.601 --> 17:04.534
It also means
that I'm pretty stupid.

17:04.603 --> 17:05.635
Why?

17:05.704 --> 17:07.604
Because I let myself
get roofied.

17:07.673 --> 17:09.873
No, Nick,
don't beat yourself up.

17:09.942 --> 17:11.182
It could've happened to anyone.

17:11.209 --> 17:12.509
I'm not anyone.

17:12.577 --> 17:13.609
No, you're right.

17:13.679 --> 17:15.444
You're no easy target.
So why you?

17:15.513 --> 17:17.681
I don't know why,
but I do know how.

17:17.749 --> 17:20.150
Your blood also showed
elevated levels of

17:20.218 --> 17:22.385
creatine peptides,
which means...

17:22.454 --> 17:24.554
Somebody roofied
my protein shake.

17:24.623 --> 17:26.289
I bring one to the gym
every night.

17:26.358 --> 17:30.160
I know. I also know how much
your protein shake means to you.

17:30.228 --> 17:33.029
Well, so did somebody else.

17:39.538 --> 17:41.204
Dr. Palmer!

17:41.273 --> 17:42.973
Come in, please.

17:49.081 --> 17:50.413
Pretty impressive, isn't it?

17:50.482 --> 17:52.816
I just... yeah, yeah.

17:52.884 --> 17:56.419
So not what I was expecting,
but it... very cool.

17:56.488 --> 17:57.387
Thank you.

17:57.456 --> 18:00.423
Turn down the music 80%, please.

18:00.492 --> 18:01.992
Turning down music.

18:03.428 --> 18:05.328
Doctor,
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

18:05.397 --> 18:07.397
I know this isn't
your department anymore, but...

18:07.466 --> 18:09.032
I found something
kind of interesting

18:09.101 --> 18:11.868
when I was examining
Agent Torres.

18:11.937 --> 18:14.337
He had constricted pupils.

18:14.406 --> 18:17.407
Well, he did suspect
he'd been drugged, didn't he?

18:17.476 --> 18:20.577
Right, but his tox screen showed
a cocktail of benzodiazepines,

18:20.645 --> 18:22.445
which, as you know, should've...

18:22.514 --> 18:25.749
Dilated his pupils
rather than constricting them.

18:25.817 --> 18:28.051
Interesting, indeed.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.552
Treadmill desk?

18:29.621 --> 18:31.421
It's just for taking a stroll.

18:31.490 --> 18:36.292
I estimate I've walked,
about 4.5 miles so far today.

18:36.361 --> 18:39.229
All without ever
leaving your office.

18:39.297 --> 18:41.364
Yeah, well, as agency historian,

18:41.433 --> 18:43.133
my first job is to annotate

18:43.201 --> 18:45.969
a mass of NCIS files.

18:46.038 --> 18:48.304
There's no way
I'm gonna do that sitting down.

18:48.373 --> 18:51.608
Yes, when I was in
Burma... Myanmar now...

18:51.676 --> 18:54.911
A history professor was
giving a long lecture

18:54.980 --> 18:58.715
on the Indochina War,
and he never sat...

19:02.154 --> 19:04.587
Dr. Palmer?

19:07.159 --> 19:08.958
Pretty cool?

19:17.302 --> 19:19.636
It's about damn time.

19:19.704 --> 19:22.472
I've been waiing for
that laptop for three weeks.

19:22.541 --> 19:25.141
And now you're gonna get it.

19:25.210 --> 19:27.644
Guy's not exactly an easy mark.

19:27.712 --> 19:29.612
Sees everything.

19:29.681 --> 19:31.681
Even noticed that I switched
to a bigger purse.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.016
You're not up to the task?

19:33.085 --> 19:34.818
I have the laptop, don't I?

19:34.886 --> 19:36.686
Did the deed in my pajamas.

19:36.721 --> 19:39.789
Sounds like things are getting
real cozy. You baking pies, too?

19:39.858 --> 19:41.291
If that's what it takes.

19:41.359 --> 19:43.460
On your right.

19:46.398 --> 19:48.264
Enjoy lunch, but not too much.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.266
Keep me updated, Clark.

19:52.037 --> 19:53.136
I don't know.

19:53.205 --> 19:54.704
In the next hour or so.

19:54.773 --> 19:56.673
Okay. Thank you.

19:56.741 --> 19:58.675
Hey. Hey.

20:01.246 --> 20:02.378
Please.

20:02.447 --> 20:04.214
Is it too early for Chardonnay?

20:04.282 --> 20:06.382
I'm way ahead of you. Yes.

20:09.521 --> 20:11.988
Thank you.

20:12.057 --> 20:14.157
That necklace

20:14.226 --> 20:15.859
is beautiful.

20:15.927 --> 20:18.294
Thanks.

20:18.363 --> 20:20.296
My boyfriend gave it to me.

20:20.365 --> 20:21.898
Really?

20:21.967 --> 20:23.666
Man's got exquisite taste.

20:23.735 --> 20:26.069
Yeah.

20:30.609 --> 20:33.042
Yeah, Gibbs?

20:33.111 --> 20:36.646
All right. I'm on my way.

20:36.715 --> 20:38.548
Work beckons.

20:38.617 --> 20:40.183
I'm so sorry.

20:40.252 --> 20:42.652
I will make it up
to you tonight,

20:42.721 --> 20:44.854
I swear.

20:44.923 --> 20:46.756
You better.

20:46.825 --> 20:48.725
Bye.

21:04.409 --> 21:06.409
Afternoon.

21:06.478 --> 21:07.911
How was lunch?

21:09.247 --> 21:12.282
Big dog's got to eat.

21:16.755 --> 21:18.087
Well, I'm glad I rushed.

21:19.658 --> 21:20.590
Sorry.

21:20.659 --> 21:22.559
Commander Hendrix was just here.

21:22.627 --> 21:24.260
He'll-he'll be right in.

21:24.329 --> 21:25.795
Gibbs, you seeing this?

21:25.864 --> 21:27.931
I am. Is that a shark?

21:27.999 --> 21:29.132
It is.

21:29.201 --> 21:31.701
What rank do you have to reach
to own a shark?

21:31.770 --> 21:33.636
Commander.

21:33.705 --> 21:36.139
Beautiful animals,
expensive hobby.

21:36.208 --> 21:38.408
I don't recommend it.
Are we ready?

21:38.476 --> 21:40.810
Well, apparently, we're on
your schedule, Commander.

21:40.879 --> 21:44.247
Looks like you gentlemen
found yourselves a ghost ship.

21:44.316 --> 21:45.248
What do you mean?

21:45.317 --> 21:46.661
Well, according
to maritime records,

21:46.685 --> 21:48.785
your fishing boat
sank nine years ago.

21:48.853 --> 21:50.253
Well, how did she
get above water?

21:50.322 --> 21:52.655
She never actually sank.

21:52.724 --> 21:54.257
Somebody made her vanish.

21:54.326 --> 21:55.425
Who?

21:55.493 --> 21:57.660
Last owner, shell company,

21:57.729 --> 22:00.630
which disbanded after
its only vessel was taken out.

22:00.699 --> 22:03.233
Well, there had to be a reason
for the secrecy.

22:03.301 --> 22:05.134
Smuggling. Commander,

22:05.203 --> 22:07.181
we're talking about
a fishing boat, not a speedboat.

22:07.205 --> 22:09.339
Exactly.
It hides in plain sight.

22:09.407 --> 22:12.108
Smugglers build go-fast boats
for open ocean travel.

22:12.177 --> 22:14.110
Low-profile, hard to detect,

22:14.179 --> 22:16.679
but it screams "arrest me"
when it arrives in port.

22:16.748 --> 22:19.182
So they rendezvous with mules
a few miles offshore,

22:19.251 --> 22:21.851
offload their contraband,
and no one's the wiser.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.119
Contraband?

22:23.188 --> 22:25.788
Narcotics, money, people.

22:25.857 --> 22:28.024
Take your pick.

22:29.861 --> 22:31.694
Hey. Hey, Nick.

22:31.763 --> 22:32.829
No.

22:32.897 --> 22:33.997
No?

22:34.065 --> 22:35.798
Don't even try it. Try what?

22:35.867 --> 22:38.268
All those mind games and
all that talkie-talkie stuff.

22:38.336 --> 22:40.203
I know what you're gonna say,
and I'm fine.

22:40.272 --> 22:41.604
What was I gonna say?

22:41.673 --> 22:43.806
You're gonna say that
it's fine to be a victim,

22:43.875 --> 22:45.886
that it's not my fault, that
it's okay that I got roofied...

22:45.910 --> 22:47.043
Maybe it is.

22:47.112 --> 22:48.978
And that an agent
as trained as me...

22:49.047 --> 22:50.647
Wait, hold on.

22:50.715 --> 22:53.216
Did you just say it is my fault?

22:53.285 --> 22:54.817
Good. So you are listening.

22:54.886 --> 22:57.887
Whatever happened
to not blaming the victim?

22:57.956 --> 23:00.723
Is that how you feel?
Like a victim?

23:00.792 --> 23:02.725
God, here comes the lollipop.

23:02.794 --> 23:03.960
Nick.

23:05.063 --> 23:06.996
Hey, McGee, Bishop,

23:07.065 --> 23:09.799
can you tell Sloane
that I'm doing fine?

23:11.703 --> 23:13.703
Um...

23:15.573 --> 23:16.973
What?

23:17.042 --> 23:19.208
What?

23:19.277 --> 23:22.512
You said you don't know
Jessica Ho, right?

23:22.580 --> 23:23.746
Right.

23:23.815 --> 23:25.481
You sure?

23:25.550 --> 23:27.561
Yeah, I already told you.
Why do you keep asking me?

23:27.585 --> 23:30.687
We just got the surveillance
footage back from your gym.

23:30.755 --> 23:32.488
Did you see who drugged me?

23:32.557 --> 23:33.823
Unfortunately, no.

23:33.892 --> 23:36.326
The interior camera system
was down.

23:36.394 --> 23:37.927
Parking garage?

23:37.996 --> 23:39.996
One camera, limited view.

23:54.346 --> 23:58.014
Nick, you were the-the last
person to see her alive.

24:06.632 --> 24:08.865
Agent Torres,
I do believe that's you

24:08.934 --> 24:10.634
walking arm-in-arm
with a dead woman.

24:12.071 --> 24:14.438
Any more surprises
that we should know about?

24:14.506 --> 24:15.972
I hope not.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.976
No. No more surprises.

24:20.045 --> 24:21.712
Are you sure about that?

24:21.814 --> 24:23.146
He's not.

24:23.215 --> 24:25.515
I just came from forensics.

24:25.584 --> 24:27.350
Here we go.

24:27.419 --> 24:29.352
The blood that was found
on your T-shirt

24:29.455 --> 24:32.689
came back as a match
to our victim, Jessica Ho.

24:32.758 --> 24:34.558
Of course.

24:34.626 --> 24:37.160
Nick...

24:37.229 --> 24:39.096
Ellie.

24:39.164 --> 24:43.266
I'm sorry
I have to ask this, but...

24:43.335 --> 24:46.103
is it possible that,

24:46.171 --> 24:48.371
in your altered state, there's
even the slightest chance

24:48.407 --> 24:49.339
that you...

24:49.408 --> 24:51.041
That I what?

24:52.644 --> 24:54.344
Shot that girl in the neck?

24:58.317 --> 25:00.550
This is ridiculous. Is it?

25:00.619 --> 25:02.797
I mean, you said it yourself.
You don't remember anything.

25:02.821 --> 25:05.288
And that makes me a murderer?

25:05.357 --> 25:08.191
You didn't kill anybody.
Right, Torres?

25:09.862 --> 25:11.895
Right.

25:11.964 --> 25:13.444
So you're not
a cold-blooded murderer.

25:13.499 --> 25:14.731
That's good to hear.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.933
But someone did kill that girl.

25:17.002 --> 25:20.103
And for your sake,
I hope you have a lead on who.

25:20.172 --> 25:21.738
Because, as far as I can tell,

25:21.807 --> 25:23.540
all the evidence is
pointing towards you.

25:23.609 --> 25:25.475
Which means I have no choice

25:25.544 --> 25:29.045
but to turn this case over
to the I.G. to initiate

25:29.114 --> 25:31.047
a level 2B investigation.

25:31.116 --> 25:33.316
First thing tomorrow morning.

25:35.721 --> 25:37.821
Yeah. I'll be right down.

25:37.856 --> 25:40.423
Torres, with me. Autopsy.

25:40.492 --> 25:42.159
Awesome.

25:44.129 --> 25:46.096
Let's find out
who else I murdered.

25:51.003 --> 25:54.171
A tiny screw, the size of a...

25:54.239 --> 25:56.673
Well, I can't think of a small
enough comparison right now,

25:56.742 --> 25:59.176
but it was really, really tiny.

25:59.244 --> 26:00.944
And I forgot to replace it,

26:01.013 --> 26:03.013
so I had to take
the whole thing apart again.

26:03.081 --> 26:04.481
The phone working or not?

26:04.550 --> 26:06.016
It's working.

26:06.084 --> 26:07.918
What about her password?

26:07.986 --> 26:09.697
With these smartphones,
it's impossible to figure out.

26:09.721 --> 26:11.188
And her password is six digits

26:11.256 --> 26:13.089
instead of four,
which makes it...

26:13.158 --> 26:15.091
infinitely impossible.

26:15.160 --> 26:16.993
But you got it. No.

26:17.062 --> 26:18.628
Then what are we doing here?

26:18.697 --> 26:20.363
I realized we don't need it.

26:20.432 --> 26:22.165
All we need...

26:24.269 --> 26:25.769
is her.

26:25.838 --> 26:26.970
Her phone has

26:27.039 --> 26:28.672
the facial recognition feature.

26:28.740 --> 26:32.209
Now, this might be a little bit
creepy, but bear with me.

26:32.277 --> 26:33.610
Okay.

26:34.847 --> 26:37.147
Damn.

26:37.216 --> 26:39.716
Aw. I really wanted
to say "voilà."

26:39.785 --> 26:41.484
Facial rec must be disabled.

26:42.521 --> 26:43.820
Here. Try it again.

26:45.457 --> 26:47.657
Voilà!

26:47.726 --> 26:49.826
We need her phone log
from the past 24 hours.

26:49.895 --> 26:50.895
On it.

26:52.464 --> 26:53.663
Well, that was easy.

26:53.732 --> 26:55.699
This phone
has only made two calls.

26:55.767 --> 26:58.168
Ever. Both to the same person.

26:59.738 --> 27:01.705
I know that number.

27:06.211 --> 27:07.477
Jack.

27:07.546 --> 27:09.079
Hey, Romeo.

27:09.147 --> 27:10.981
How'd Mallory like her necklace?

27:11.049 --> 27:12.883
Worked like a charm.

27:12.951 --> 27:16.186
Agent Torres's personal trainer.

27:16.255 --> 27:18.521
How's he mixed up in all this?

27:18.590 --> 27:19.890
Our victim, Jessica Ho,

27:19.958 --> 27:21.992
called him
right before she was killed.

27:22.060 --> 27:23.393
Really?

27:23.462 --> 27:25.161
And how's Agent Torres
holding up?

27:25.230 --> 27:26.930
He says he's good.

27:26.999 --> 27:29.099
But he's more shaken
than he realized,

27:29.167 --> 27:31.167
so I asked if we could talk.

27:33.939 --> 27:35.605
What is going on, bro?

27:35.674 --> 27:37.941
You tell me, bro.

27:40.412 --> 27:41.544
Who's this?

27:41.613 --> 27:43.179
You recognize her now?

27:43.248 --> 27:45.015
Whoa, dude! Not cool, man.

27:45.083 --> 27:46.427
You know my whole thing
with night terrors.

27:46.451 --> 27:48.618
That's the least
of your problems.

27:48.687 --> 27:51.388
That's the girl who was
killed outside of the gym.

27:53.458 --> 27:55.392
What's this have to do with me?

27:55.460 --> 27:57.694
She called you
the night she was killed,

27:57.763 --> 27:59.529
and the night before that.

27:59.598 --> 28:02.899
The chick that called me
is the same one who got shot?

28:02.968 --> 28:04.034
Wait, you never met her?

28:04.102 --> 28:05.435
Not face-to-face.

28:05.504 --> 28:07.570
She just cold-called me
out of the blue.

28:07.606 --> 28:08.905
What'd she want?

28:08.974 --> 28:10.740
A favor.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.542
It was more like an offer,
I guess.

28:13.879 --> 28:15.178
She said she'd pay me ten grand,

28:15.247 --> 28:16.958
and all I had to do was be late
to your training session.

28:16.982 --> 28:18.448
Why?

28:18.517 --> 28:19.883
She didn't say.

28:19.952 --> 28:21.985
But you did it anyways?

28:22.054 --> 28:23.286
For ten grand?

28:23.355 --> 28:24.654
Yeah.

28:24.723 --> 28:26.323
All I had to do
was be a little late.

28:26.391 --> 28:28.158
I didn't know
anyone would end up dead.

28:28.226 --> 28:30.560
How'd she pay you?

28:30.629 --> 28:32.228
ChargeMo.

28:32.297 --> 28:34.130
It's an app.

28:39.738 --> 28:41.938
Jordan Peralta's
ChargeMo account.

28:42.007 --> 28:44.507
$10,000 was deposited into it

28:44.576 --> 28:46.242
the afternoon
Jessica was killed.

28:46.311 --> 28:48.078
Deposited by who?
Account traces back

28:48.146 --> 28:49.757
to a business called
Brueger Marine Lines.

28:49.781 --> 28:51.848
Brueger?

28:51.917 --> 28:53.249
Yeah. It's an international

28:53.318 --> 28:55.785
shipping company
based out of Belgium.

28:55.854 --> 28:57.420
Zero Internet presence.

28:57.489 --> 29:00.323
Why would a shipping company
bribe your trainer to be late?

29:00.392 --> 29:02.092
So that girl could
drug and kidnap him.

29:02.160 --> 29:04.327
Yeah, she was a real Mona Lisa.

29:04.396 --> 29:06.696
Sorry, Mona Lisa,
like the painting?

29:06.765 --> 29:08.598
No, not like the
painting. Like...

29:08.667 --> 29:10.934
Mona Lisa, like the girl
who lures in their victims

29:11.003 --> 29:12.469
into dangerous situations.

29:12.537 --> 29:14.204
You don't listen to rap, do you?

29:14.272 --> 29:15.438
No. There's, like,

29:15.507 --> 29:17.273
whole songs dedicated
to these girls.

29:17.342 --> 29:19.275
Except that, in the songs,

29:19.344 --> 29:21.511
Mona Lisas don't end up dead.

29:21.580 --> 29:23.446
So why did yours?

29:23.515 --> 29:25.949
Did her job.
They didn't need her anymore.

29:26.018 --> 29:28.385
Who's "they"? And what
did they want with me?

29:28.453 --> 29:29.652
I don't know,

29:29.721 --> 29:33.790
but I think I know
what they were smuggling.

29:33.859 --> 29:36.026
The blade you found
on the fishing boat is made

29:36.094 --> 29:37.627
of phosphorous and bronze,

29:37.696 --> 29:39.562
one of the world's
strongest alloys,

29:39.631 --> 29:41.398
which is used
specifically to cut...

29:41.466 --> 29:42.832
Diamonds.

29:44.136 --> 29:45.668
You just stole my thunder.

29:45.737 --> 29:47.137
But, yes, Nick, diamonds it is.

29:47.205 --> 29:48.838
I knew Brueger sounded familiar.

29:48.907 --> 29:50.507
Back in my undercover days,

29:50.575 --> 29:52.876
I-I worked on a joint
investigation where we seized

29:52.944 --> 29:55.045
a shipment of stolen diamonds.

29:55.113 --> 29:57.047
Joint investigation with who?

29:57.115 --> 29:58.748
The Coast Guard.

30:06.958 --> 30:09.993
Here we go. Operation IronWheel.

30:10.062 --> 30:12.562
Stolen, uncut diamonds
were smuggled

30:12.631 --> 30:15.598
into the country
on container ships leased by...

30:15.667 --> 30:18.001
Brueger Marine Lines.
That's right.

30:18.070 --> 30:20.070
It was a joint investigation
with NCIS.

30:20.138 --> 30:22.272
We seized $12 million
worth of diamonds,

30:22.340 --> 30:24.040
apprehended two suspects.

30:24.109 --> 30:26.409
Impressive haul, Torres.

30:26.478 --> 30:28.545
Your boys did
the legwork, Commander.

30:28.613 --> 30:30.413
I only came down
for the takedown.

30:30.482 --> 30:32.515
Short but, very sweet.

30:33.585 --> 30:34.784
Don't.

30:34.853 --> 30:36.453
She doesn't like it.

30:36.521 --> 30:38.254
Didn't she used to have a buddy?

30:38.323 --> 30:39.355
She ate him.

30:39.424 --> 30:41.357
We need to see
everything you have

30:41.426 --> 30:43.426
on Brueger Marine Lines. Can't.

30:43.495 --> 30:45.128
Case is still pending.

30:45.197 --> 30:46.930
Pending?

30:46.998 --> 30:48.898
We made that bust,
like, five years ago.

30:48.934 --> 30:50.934
The slow wheels of justice.

30:51.002 --> 30:53.303
Trial should be coming up
in a couple of months.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.140
Easterling!

30:57.209 --> 30:58.741
Tell you what.

30:58.810 --> 31:01.578
I can show you boys
everything we got on Brueger,

31:01.646 --> 31:03.613
as long as you stay
on the premises.

31:07.619 --> 31:08.952
Yes, Commander?

31:09.020 --> 31:10.787
With me, please.

31:10.856 --> 31:13.923
We keep all evidence in active
cases under strict lock and key.

31:18.463 --> 31:21.598
Why the sudden interest
in this case, Gibbs?

31:21.666 --> 31:23.166
Due diligence.

31:23.235 --> 31:26.236
Here we are.
All the info we have on Brueger.

31:26.304 --> 31:28.171
Easterling will be here
for anything you need.

31:29.975 --> 31:33.610
You know, this was
my first water raid, Gibbs.

31:33.678 --> 31:35.945
It was a freezing night.

31:36.014 --> 31:37.614
And, finally,
at 400 in the morning,

31:37.682 --> 31:41.518
we saw a little, tiny...
dot of light in the water.

31:41.586 --> 31:44.454
Turned out to be a dot
worth $12 million.

31:47.259 --> 31:49.425
All the evidence here?

31:49.528 --> 31:50.760
You bet.

31:50.829 --> 31:52.462
The diamonds, too?

31:52.531 --> 31:54.264
Yes, sir. Okay.

31:54.332 --> 31:55.598
Show us. Let's see 'em.

32:10.048 --> 32:12.115
Where are they? The diamonds.

32:12.184 --> 32:14.551
I saw them last week
during inventory.

32:14.619 --> 32:17.487
Who was the last person
to have access to the room?

32:24.930 --> 32:26.329
According to
the iris scanner log,

32:26.398 --> 32:28.865
only one person has accessed
this room in the past week.

32:28.934 --> 32:30.833
Who?

32:30.902 --> 32:33.570
You, Agent Torres.

32:51.998 --> 32:54.432
Nick, what are you doing?

32:54.501 --> 32:56.868
Just making sure.

32:56.936 --> 32:58.836
You didn't steal
the diamonds, Nick.

32:58.905 --> 33:01.973
Really?

33:02.041 --> 33:05.109
Just like I didn't break into
some random fishing boat?

33:05.178 --> 33:07.278
Just like I didn't
get Jessica Ho killed?

33:07.347 --> 33:09.714
I mean, I figure, hey,

33:09.782 --> 33:12.183
at this point, I might as well
check for the diamonds, too.

33:12.252 --> 33:13.551
Hey, just calm down, okay?

33:13.620 --> 33:15.620
No, McGee, you calm down.

33:15.688 --> 33:18.623
Hey! You done?

33:18.691 --> 33:20.291
You're not a thief.

33:20.393 --> 33:22.159
Well, if I didn't steal them,
then who did?

33:22.228 --> 33:25.496
Same person who killed
Jessica Ho and kidnapped you.

33:25.565 --> 33:27.865
And how'd they do it?

33:27.934 --> 33:29.174
Well, there's only three people

33:29.235 --> 33:30.902
that have access
to that evidence room.

33:30.970 --> 33:33.137
Commander Hendrix,
the federal prosecutor

33:33.206 --> 33:35.373
assigned to the trial,

33:35.441 --> 33:37.875
and the NCIS agent
who made the bust.

33:37.944 --> 33:39.310
Me.

33:39.379 --> 33:41.178
We already did some digging,

33:41.247 --> 33:44.348
and the commander and prosecutor
both have solid alibis.

33:44.417 --> 33:46.217
Which leaves me, again.

33:46.286 --> 33:48.386
Yeah, or someone posing as you.

33:48.454 --> 33:51.756
The problem is the iris scanner;
It's calibrated specifically

33:51.824 --> 33:53.190
to your eyes, and
it-it's difficult

33:53.259 --> 33:54.392
to circumvent.

33:54.460 --> 33:57.361
Difficult, but not impossible.

33:57.430 --> 33:59.330
You did not steal
the diamonds, Nick.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.066
Someone stole your eyes.

34:02.135 --> 34:03.067
What?

34:03.136 --> 34:05.169
- How?
- Well, not your eyes,

34:05.238 --> 34:06.337
your irises.

34:06.406 --> 34:07.872
And they didn't steal them,

34:07.941 --> 34:09.840
they copied them.

34:09.909 --> 34:11.286
Which explains why
you were drugged.

34:11.311 --> 34:13.110
Someone needed you
out of commission

34:13.179 --> 34:14.946
so they could take
a super high-res photo

34:15.014 --> 34:18.416
of your irises
from a very close range.

34:25.024 --> 34:26.857
Kasie identified

34:26.926 --> 34:29.427
the compound in your blood.

34:29.495 --> 34:33.431
It's a rare drug
called dapiprazole.

34:33.498 --> 34:36.367
Optometrists use it
to induce myosis.

34:36.436 --> 34:39.170
That's, constriction
of the pupils.

34:39.205 --> 34:41.272
A constricted pupil
makes it much easier

34:41.341 --> 34:43.407
to examine the intricacies
of the iris.

34:43.476 --> 34:46.377
Using a high-resolution
photographic image,

34:46.446 --> 34:48.212
it is possible to fabricate

34:48.281 --> 34:49.880
a contact lens

34:49.949 --> 34:53.050
imprinted with
the unique characteristics

34:53.119 --> 34:54.652
of the person's iris.

34:54.721 --> 34:57.822
We fabricated this lens

34:57.890 --> 35:01.459
using your iris
scan data NCIS has

35:01.527 --> 35:02.994
in your personnel file.

35:03.062 --> 35:04.562
As you all know,

35:04.631 --> 35:06.230
Dr. Palmer cannot

35:06.299 --> 35:09.100
normally access MTAC.

35:09.168 --> 35:12.003
But Special Agent Torres can.

35:17.310 --> 35:19.777
Whoa. Impressive.

35:19.846 --> 35:21.979
Except it still doesn't tell us
how they snuck into.

35:22.048 --> 35:23.914
Coast Guard Headquarters
in the first place.

35:23.983 --> 35:26.817
I'm guessing if they can fake
an iris, they can fake an I.D.

35:26.886 --> 35:28.986
Yeah, but they still need
someone on the inside,

35:29.055 --> 35:30.755
tell them where
the diamonds were stored.

35:32.992 --> 35:35.459
Yes, sir, we're reviewing
our security protocol.

35:37.063 --> 35:39.463
And we're making every effort...

35:39.532 --> 35:41.632
Will do, sir.

35:41.701 --> 35:43.501
The hell is NCIS?

35:43.569 --> 35:45.269
On their way up, Commander.

35:45.338 --> 35:47.104
Agent Gibbs,

35:47.173 --> 35:48.806
tell me you've got good news.

35:48.875 --> 35:50.341
Good news? For who?

35:50.410 --> 35:52.209
Do you have any leads
on the diamonds?

35:52.278 --> 35:54.478
Got a suspect in mind.

35:54.547 --> 35:56.480
You have an alibi
for that night?

35:56.549 --> 35:59.784
An alibi? Are you kidding me?

35:59.852 --> 36:01.552
Not you, Commander.

36:02.689 --> 36:04.555
You.

36:06.225 --> 36:07.358
Hi.

36:07.427 --> 36:10.394
You got the wrong girl.

36:10.463 --> 36:13.064
Well, the "wrong girl" here
forged prescriptions

36:13.132 --> 36:15.066
for clonazepam and
ketamine last week.

36:15.134 --> 36:17.568
The same drugs that
blacked me out that night.

36:17.637 --> 36:21.472
The "wrong girl" also
sent dozens of e-mails

36:21.541 --> 36:24.141
to a well-known associate
of Brueger Marine Lines.

36:24.210 --> 36:26.177
The diamond smugglers?

36:26.245 --> 36:29.380
She cut a deal to sell
the diamonds back to them.

36:29.449 --> 36:31.582
But based on your
negative bank balance,

36:31.651 --> 36:34.051
I'd say they haven't
paid you yet.

36:34.120 --> 36:36.053
I think you still
got the diamonds.

36:36.122 --> 36:38.322
No.

36:38.391 --> 36:39.757
Search my apartment,

36:39.826 --> 36:42.693
my car, everything I own.

36:42.762 --> 36:44.428
We're doing that now.

36:45.932 --> 36:47.172
Okay, this is crazy, Commander.

36:47.233 --> 36:49.233
They can search all they want.

36:50.470 --> 36:51.736
They won't find anything.

36:51.804 --> 36:53.070
You know what, she's right.

36:53.139 --> 36:54.371
They won't.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.040
But we will.

36:56.109 --> 37:00.611
The really funny thing
about uncut diamonds...

37:08.788 --> 37:13.090
they look like
little clear rocks.

37:19.298 --> 37:21.298
The old diamonds

37:21.367 --> 37:23.067
in the shark tank trick?

37:23.136 --> 37:25.035
Didn't I see that
in a movie once?

37:25.104 --> 37:27.638
Pretty smart place to stash them
while she waited to get paid.

37:27.707 --> 37:31.041
Too bad she wasn't smart
enough to encrypt her e-mails

37:31.110 --> 37:32.743
to the smugglers she worked for.

37:32.812 --> 37:34.578
Well, either way,

37:34.647 --> 37:36.947
she's done feeding the fish
for a while, right, Nick?

37:41.220 --> 37:43.454
Good luck with that.

37:49.896 --> 37:51.629
You hungry?

37:56.068 --> 37:59.236
Sure you want to break bread
with a, with a killer?

37:59.305 --> 38:02.873
I see.

38:02.942 --> 38:05.142
That's what the
silent treatment is about.

38:05.211 --> 38:07.311
You accuse your buddy

38:07.380 --> 38:10.447
of being a killer one time...

38:12.151 --> 38:14.518
What do you want from me?

38:14.587 --> 38:15.853
An apology?

38:15.922 --> 38:17.087
Nope.

38:17.156 --> 38:19.156
Then what?

38:21.360 --> 38:23.460
Maybe a little faith.

38:23.529 --> 38:27.198
I have more than
a little faith in you.

38:27.266 --> 38:28.499
You know that.

38:28.568 --> 38:30.835
It's just, in that moment,

38:30.937 --> 38:32.870
you looked guilty as hell.

38:37.577 --> 38:39.844
Come on, if the shoe
were on the other foot,

38:39.912 --> 38:41.846
you would've asked
the same questions.

38:41.914 --> 38:43.614
No.

38:45.885 --> 38:48.018
I wouldn't.

38:50.122 --> 38:53.524
So I guess that's
a no on dinner.

38:53.593 --> 38:56.627
Hey, Nick, you're okay, right?

38:56.696 --> 38:59.330
I guess I'll find out.

39:13.212 --> 39:15.179
Nice work.

39:15.248 --> 39:17.648
I'll get this
back to him tonight.

39:17.717 --> 39:19.850
Then your assignment's over.

39:19.919 --> 39:22.319
End the relationship
immediately.

39:22.388 --> 39:24.255
Gladly.

39:26.492 --> 39:28.158
Well, well.

39:29.328 --> 39:30.861
Gang's all here.

39:30.930 --> 39:32.396
Leon.

39:32.465 --> 39:34.198
Don't bother.

39:34.267 --> 39:36.033
Then your assignment's over.

39:36.102 --> 39:38.235
End the relationship
immediately.

39:40.106 --> 39:42.506
Gladly.

39:45.645 --> 39:47.278
Your gift was
a recording device.

39:47.346 --> 39:49.179
Never spy on a spy.

39:49.248 --> 39:51.048
Leon.

39:52.518 --> 39:54.685
I don't know what to say.

39:54.754 --> 39:57.421
I think "gladly"
summed it up nicely.

40:01.627 --> 40:04.461
Here.

40:04.530 --> 40:06.530
Saves me a trip.

40:10.369 --> 40:13.270
All right, this ends now.

40:13.339 --> 40:16.206
The surveillance,
the laptop sweep, all of it.

40:16.275 --> 40:18.309
I couldn't agree more.

40:19.812 --> 40:20.812
Why?

40:20.880 --> 40:22.446
The Director of NCIS

40:22.515 --> 40:24.548
was a hostage
of an enemy regime.

40:24.617 --> 40:27.084
It's standard
operating procedure

40:27.153 --> 40:29.954
to monitor captives
after their return

40:30.022 --> 40:31.588
to ensure that
they've not become

40:31.657 --> 40:33.390
an agent of a foreign power.

40:33.459 --> 40:35.893
And it took you six months
to figure out that I wasn't?

40:35.962 --> 40:37.061
No, that took two months.

40:37.129 --> 40:39.430
Okay, what about the last four?

40:54.046 --> 40:55.980
This is
an off-the-books account.

40:56.048 --> 40:58.415
Offshore bank.

40:58.484 --> 41:00.818
I accidentally stumbled
across it a year ago.

41:00.886 --> 41:02.753
What,

41:02.822 --> 41:04.421
CIA is looking for
a new accountant?

41:04.490 --> 41:06.690
It's not CIA's.

41:06.759 --> 41:09.326
Whose is it? I made a
few discreet inquiries

41:09.395 --> 41:11.695
and I learned that nobody cares.

41:11.764 --> 41:14.365
The intelligence
community is under

41:14.433 --> 41:17.468
assault right now, and no one
wants to stick their neck out.

41:17.536 --> 41:20.004
But that's a quarter of
a billion dollar slush fund

41:20.072 --> 41:22.339
with zero accountability.

41:22.408 --> 41:24.174
That is a building on fire
right there,

41:24.243 --> 41:25.609
and everyone's running away.

41:25.678 --> 41:27.644
Why the hell
are you following me?

41:27.713 --> 41:31.015
Because I learned
something watching you.

41:32.385 --> 41:36.120
You just might be
the last good man in D.C.

41:36.188 --> 41:38.522
You, Agent Gibbs,

41:38.591 --> 41:41.825
your team.

41:41.894 --> 41:44.328
But I had to be sure.

41:44.397 --> 41:46.797
And now I am...

41:46.866 --> 41:48.732
and I need help.

41:48.801 --> 41:50.667
I cannot do this alone.

41:50.736 --> 41:52.536
You traced the account.

41:53.906 --> 41:55.906
Whose is it?

42:00.880 --> 42:02.646
Your boss.

42:02.715 --> 42:05.816
Wait a minute.

42:05.885 --> 42:08.919
What's the United States
Secretary of Defense

42:08.988 --> 42:11.155
doing with a quarter
of a billion dollars

42:11.223 --> 42:13.357
in a secret account?

42:13.426 --> 42:15.359
Can't be good.

42:17.496 --> 42:21.231
Now I think it's time to run
into that burning building.

42:21.300 --> 42:23.367
You want to come with?
