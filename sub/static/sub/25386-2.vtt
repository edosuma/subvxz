00:12.971 --> 00:13.930
Well, with all the campers
pitching in,

00:13.930 --> 00:15.932
the mess hall,
and our new cabins
are almost ready!

00:16.391 --> 00:19.936
Yeah, telling them it was
an "arts and crafts project"

00:19.936 --> 00:22.605
was a great way
of skirting child labor laws.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.649
I've never been
more proud of you.

00:25.734 --> 00:28.528
Zuri, the purpose
of this was to build unity,

00:28.528 --> 00:31.865
and give the kids
a sense of ownership
over the new Camp Kikiwaka.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.450
That's good.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.493
Make sure to say it
just like that when the cops
come knocking.

00:37.495 --> 00:38.997
This is boring.

00:39.289 --> 00:41.041
I want to do something fun.

00:41.041 --> 00:44.043
Uh, but learning to use
a hammer is fun.

00:44.043 --> 00:45.420
Not for the teacher.

00:48.047 --> 00:48.798
Not my fault.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.010
You kept moving
your hand when you were
holding the nail.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.929
Yeah, 'cause you kept
hitting me.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.892
Well, well, well...

00:59.517 --> 01:03.104
What a quaint,
cozy little cabin.

01:03.104 --> 01:05.190
Yeah, is it for your dolls?

01:05.190 --> 01:06.941
(ALL GIGGLE)

01:06.941 --> 01:10.236
Big talk from a kid
who could fit
in my doll's stroller.

01:14.532 --> 01:17.077
I still can't believe
you made your cabin
two stories.

01:17.327 --> 01:21.081
I took a few extracurricular
structural engineering
classes.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.751
Which is why I was
too busy to go on dates
this school year.

01:25.335 --> 01:29.506
Dude, I just met you
and even I know
that's not true.

For legal reasons,

ALL: Me!

02:03.206 --> 02:04.457
Think we all saw that comin'.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.961
I should be
in charge, obvi.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.004
I am the smartest,

Cough, Zuri, cough.

02:15.927 --> 02:17.846
Well, it shouldn't be Ravi.

02:18.138 --> 02:21.850
The last thing he ran was
the lizard club, and even
the lizards quit that.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.186
Guys, I think
I should be in charge.

02:25.186 --> 02:28.481
I am 18, I love the camp,
plus I'm the only one
tall enough to change

02:28.481 --> 02:30.608
the light bulbs
in the office without
a step stool.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.154

Great, so it is
a three-way tie.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.363
How should we decide?

02:36.948 --> 02:38.408
Well, in my family,
we'd always play
"Rock, Rock, Rock."

02:38.700 --> 02:40.535
You mean,
"Rock, Paper, Scissors?"

02:40.535 --> 02:44.122
Nope. We'd just throw rocks
at each other and the last one
standing won.

02:45.748 --> 02:47.709
Good thing you didn't
play "Scissors, Scissors,
Scissors."

02:49.502 --> 02:50.670
Well, we did,

02:52.130 --> 02:53.548
until the "incident."

02:55.425 --> 02:58.887
But Mee-Maw is living proof
you don't need thumbs
to lead a full life.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.598
Actually, Lou,

03:01.848 --> 03:04.183
I think since you've been here
the longest,

03:04.183 --> 03:05.810
you should
cast the deciding vote.

03:06.185 --> 03:07.020
Wait!
What?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.022
I choose you, bestie!
Yay!

03:09.022 --> 03:10.398
What a shock.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.985
Well, with Emma in charge,
the camp may fail miserably.

03:13.985 --> 03:16.613
But at least,
everyone's manicures
will look "supes cute."

03:18.072 --> 03:19.741
Let me get this straight.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.744
So, Emma's in charge
because she's old
and can reach things?

03:23.620 --> 03:26.289
I would like to point out,
I shaved three times
this year,

03:26.289 --> 03:27.957
and I can put
lifts into my shoes.

03:29.959 --> 03:32.378
Guys, Emma's gonna be
an awesome leader.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.381
She's great with the campers,
she was an amazing CIT,

03:35.381 --> 03:37.884
and I really think
she's ready for this.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.136
Aww. Thanks, Lou.

03:40.136 --> 03:41.638
So it's settled.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.973
And nobody had to throw rocks
or scissors at each other.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.892
The day ain't over yet.

03:50.813 --> 03:53.107

My gosh, isn't this so much
nicer than our old cabin?

03:55.818 --> 03:59.072
I've seen rest stop bathrooms
nicer than our old cabin.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.490
What do you mean?

04:00.907 --> 04:02.116
I thought it was charming.

04:02.575 --> 04:05.703
And, it's not officially
Woodchuck cabin without...

04:07.497 --> 04:09.457
Uhh, A giant burnt rat?

04:10.792 --> 04:11.960
No.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.503

Woody, the Woodchuck.

04:15.672 --> 04:16.881
Uhh, Lou.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.009
I was thinking we should get
a new Woodchuck mascot.

04:20.009 --> 04:21.010
(GASPS) Shh.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.681
Not in front of Woody!
Woodchucks have
very good hearing.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.809
You think he would've
heard that big rig
that took him out.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.688
Actually, Lou, I was thinking
we should get
a brand new mascot

04:31.688 --> 04:33.606
to go along with the brand new
Camp Kikiwaka.

04:34.023 --> 04:35.191
Brand new camp?

04:36.276 --> 04:38.111
Yeah, I made a big list
of things to do to improve
this whole place!

04:38.111 --> 04:39.195
And I'm gonna need your help.

04:40.738 --> 04:41.739
Wow!

04:42.156 --> 04:44.409
You're planning
on making a lot of changes.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.452
You shouldn't see this.

04:47.578 --> 04:50.290
Zuri, I want you and Destiny
to decorate the new
Woodchuck cabin.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.000
Yay!
Great!

04:52.000 --> 04:54.919
And remember,
my new policy is
the camper is always right!

04:54.919 --> 04:56.337
So Destiny gets
whatever she wants.

04:56.337 --> 04:58.047
Yay!
Say, what now?

04:59.007 --> 05:00.383
But I'm a camper, too.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.135
Yeah, but you're
also co-owner,

05:02.135 --> 05:04.387
so you have to do
whatever your newly
elected leader says.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.225
Lou, do you still
have that gavel?

05:09.225 --> 05:11.227
Why, do you want to call
another owner's meeting?

05:11.227 --> 05:12.228
Nope.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.067
I have such a surprise
for you two!

05:18.318 --> 05:20.653
I'm not the biggest fan
of surprises.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.739

05:31.289 --> 05:33.875
Dude, this place is awesome!

05:34.334 --> 05:37.462
There's so much to climb
and jump off of!

05:37.462 --> 05:40.214

himself getting hurt in here.

05:57.940 --> 06:00.401
Dude, nice job on the cabin.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.403
Up-top!
Oh, thank you.

06:02.403 --> 06:05.406
My goal this year
is to be the coolest
counselor-slash-owner

06:05.406 --> 06:06.783
this camp has ever seen!

06:06.783 --> 06:09.869
Like the mighty phoenix,
our cabin has risen
from the ashes,

06:09.869 --> 06:11.871
and now, I too am reborn!

06:11.871 --> 06:13.164
So, slap me some skin my...

06:14.207 --> 06:15.208
And he's gone.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.252
Anyhoo, enjoy your schwag,
Grizzle-bros.

06:18.252 --> 06:20.171

06:21.631 --> 06:23.508
Ooh, a label maker!

06:24.383 --> 06:27.762
Sweet, I'm gonna have
an all-night label sesh!

06:28.262 --> 06:30.264
(DRYLY) You really know
how to party.

06:32.683 --> 06:33.684
Hey!

06:34.227 --> 06:36.062
Keep your greasy fingers off.

06:36.437 --> 06:37.980
I know where they've been,

06:37.980 --> 06:40.358
and I know you didn't
wash them afterwards.

06:40.358 --> 06:41.442
Oh, ya?

06:41.442 --> 06:42.276
Smell this.

06:42.276 --> 06:43.277
Eew!

06:45.196 --> 06:47.532
And I want
a floor-length
mirror here,

06:47.532 --> 06:50.368
and of course,
my own vanity here.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.745
Mmm.
(GASPS)

06:52.745 --> 06:55.206

a great cubby hole

07:00.795 --> 07:03.256

shaped like a tiara.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.466
Are you writing this down?

07:07.218 --> 07:08.761
Oh, I'm writing
something down.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.057
Something wrong, Zuri?

07:13.307 --> 07:15.518
Destiny, we all have to
share this cabin,

07:15.810 --> 07:19.147
so maybe you could think
of things other people
might like, too.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.441
Okay, like what?

07:22.316 --> 07:24.026
How about some
country music posters?

07:24.360 --> 07:25.445
Sure!

07:25.445 --> 07:28.197
Anybody but creaky old
Blake Shelton.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.409
Will you excuse me a moment?

07:32.743 --> 07:34.454
(SCREAMING)

07:36.456 --> 07:37.748
Okay, where were we?

07:38.458 --> 07:41.419
Oh, yeah, you were
telling me what to do.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.796
Emma said that I can
have anything I want.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.423
And she's in charge,

07:46.090 --> 07:47.383
not you.

07:47.675 --> 07:50.011
Fine, then do it yourself.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.554
And I hope you break a nail!

07:51.554 --> 07:53.431
(GASPS) You take that back!

07:53.890 --> 07:56.559
Hey, you didn't write down
any of what I said!

07:56.559 --> 07:59.645
(GASPS)
And that is a really bad word!

08:05.234 --> 08:08.070
And we should convert
the fire pit to run
on gas, it's faster.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.448
Oh, and motors
for the canoes so nobody
has to break a sweat!

08:10.740 --> 08:12.658
Man, ideas are just
spilling out of me!

08:14.118 --> 08:15.703
So are the eggs
from breakfast.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.872
At least, you stopped
spitting on my clipboard.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.543
Whoa, an inflatable cabin.

08:22.543 --> 08:25.755
Whoever lives in that thing,
should not play "Scissors,
Scissors, Scissors."

08:26.547 --> 08:27.465
No, it's a bouncy house.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.217
I'm going to order
a bunch more of these,

08:29.217 --> 08:30.968
and turn the lake
into a mini water park!

08:33.554 --> 08:34.555
But, Emma,

08:34.555 --> 08:36.098
this is our fishin' spot.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.476
Only thing we don't catch
in there is cooties.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.813
Look, Lou,
I know change is difficult,

08:42.813 --> 08:45.358
but mini water parks
are the hottest things
at summer camps right now.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.401
Who cares what
the other camps are doing?

08:47.401 --> 08:48.486
I do.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.779
I need to make
this camp great.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.155
The campers are
depending on me.

08:51.405 --> 08:53.533
Plus, Ravi and Zuri are just
waiting for me to fail,

08:53.533 --> 08:54.700
so they can rub it in my face.

08:55.117 --> 08:57.537
Well, I think the camp
is great the way it is.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.580
Really?

08:59.580 --> 09:01.374
It was voted
the "Worst Place To Visit"
in all of Maine.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.834
Number two was
a used coffin store.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.881
Yeah, I know,
but they have the best slogan.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.300
"The price is so nice,
you'll wanna die twice."

09:16.013 --> 09:17.014
(ZURI GASPS)

09:17.557 --> 09:18.975
Holy glitz!

09:19.809 --> 09:22.436
It looks like a beauty pageant
just threw up in here!

09:23.563 --> 09:27.191
Sorry, but you're the one
who left me to decorate
it myself.

09:27.441 --> 09:30.486
I think all the hair spray
has finally seeped
into your brain.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.990
Where did you
get all this?

09:34.365 --> 09:35.658
My pageant bags.

09:35.658 --> 09:36.867
Gotta be prepared

09:37.243 --> 09:39.745
You never know
when a local beauty
contest might happen.

09:40.454 --> 09:42.498
The town's called Moose Rump.

09:42.498 --> 09:45.167
All you would need
to win a beauty pageant
here is two teeth.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.338
What did you do to my bed?

09:50.172 --> 09:52.425
I told you, glitter storage.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.429
I can't believe you
took advantage
when my back was turned.

09:57.054 --> 09:59.223
I'm usually the one
that does that to people!

10:00.308 --> 10:01.809
Well, then,
you shouldn't have left.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.562
In the pageant world,
we have a saying.

10:04.562 --> 10:08.608
"If you storm off the stage,
you don't get a trophy.
Or a ride home."

10:11.777 --> 10:12.862
Well, guess what?

10:12.862 --> 10:14.947
Your glitter
just became litter!

10:16.616 --> 10:17.366
What are you doing?

10:17.867 --> 10:19.118

10:19.118 --> 10:20.244

Hey, it's not my fault.

leaves on the lawn!

10:37.637 --> 10:39.221
Hey!

10:39.221 --> 10:41.557
Wanna see my impression
of the cover

10:56.572 --> 10:57.573
Hey, dude!

10:58.449 --> 11:01.160
I invented a new sport
called "Crashketball."

11:01.535 --> 11:03.162
Wanna play?

11:03.162 --> 11:06.415
A game that combines
all the dangers of sports
and heights?

11:07.083 --> 11:10.002
I'd rather use
your dirty socks
as a washcloth.

11:11.253 --> 11:12.463
What's a washcloth?

11:14.006 --> 11:17.009
And there's reason number two
why I don't want to
play with you.

You broke my ZoomMaster!

is worth four points.

11:43.619 --> 11:44.662
You broke my stuff!

Let's see how you like it
when I break your stuff.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.126
Ow!

11:50.126 --> 11:52.920
(GIGGLES) The only thing
you broke was your foot.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.548
And your football lamp.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.541
Well, now that you're done
with that, you can go
order a new Spirit Stick.

Wait, a new Spirit Stick?

12:33.752 --> 12:35.671

at the camp for a 100 years.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.631

a really cool one online.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.018
but you are ruining

Wow.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.354
You're not being
very supportive.

I'm just trying to do
what's best for everyone.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.150
Oh, really?

12:56.150 --> 12:58.944
Is that why you had me
change the sign to read
"Emma Ross's Camp Kikiwaka?"

12:59.695 --> 13:01.280
Yes! It's called "branding."

13:01.280 --> 13:02.740
I'm very popular
on the Internet.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.701

likes him.

13:08.704 --> 13:09.914
Oh, geez.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.999
I'm sorry you're not happy
with the way I'm leading.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.876
Maybe you should
fill out a comment card.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.172
This may be a bad time,

13:18.172 --> 13:19.840
but I need you to go make
a comment card box.

Cookies!

13:34.855 --> 13:36.607
Thanks, Ravi, I'm starving.

13:36.815 --> 13:38.859
No! You get no cookies!

in you both.

to make this the coolest cabin
in the world.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.172
But apparently,
that means diddly-squat!

14:01.465 --> 14:02.841
Forgive my language.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.386
Sorry, Ravi.

14:05.844 --> 14:08.097
Yeah, we really let you down.

place to hang out
while Ravi cools off.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.368
You get to be safe indoors,

14:29.368 --> 14:33.330
and I get to get rid
of all the extra energy
my mom always complains about.

Ravi got mad at us
and kicked us out.

Really?

14:45.759 --> 14:47.386
Zuri and I
got into a fight, too.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.306
I was just about to
bounce off some steam.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.433
Great, we'll join you!

14:52.808 --> 14:54.810
Uh, are you sure it's safe?

14:54.810 --> 14:57.021
I mean, there's no
lifeguards out here.

14:57.646 --> 15:00.399
Safer than being out
in the woods by yourself.

can I help you?

15:27.593 --> 15:30.804
Nope. Just waiting
for Emma to tell me
what I should order.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.349
Oh, is this one
of those girl things?

15:33.349 --> 15:35.100
Like when you all go
to the bathroom together,

15:35.100 --> 15:37.019
or conspire to give me
fake phone numbers?

15:38.228 --> 15:40.397
Oh come on, Lou, whatever
you want is fine with me.

15:40.898 --> 15:42.942
What I want is to jam
that new spirit stick...

15:42.942 --> 15:44.568
Okay!

15:45.527 --> 15:47.154
Well, this is
getting awkward.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.864
So, let me make
this easy for you.

15:49.114 --> 15:52.618
Predictably, Emma neglected
to place the food order

15:52.618 --> 15:55.454
so I had to make a meal
using only a hunk of cheese,

15:55.454 --> 15:57.790
some sawdust,
and what I pray is...

15:57.790 --> 15:58.916

Hummus.

Sorry, I was busy sending
back the animals I got
for the petting zoo.

as cuddly as the pictures
on the website.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.510
Emma, there you are!

16:09.510 --> 16:11.512
Because of you,
and your crazy idea

16:11.512 --> 16:14.390
that Destiny should decide
on cabin decorations,

16:14.390 --> 16:15.724
we got into a big fight!

16:16.308 --> 16:17.643
Okay, fine, I'll talk to her.

16:17.643 --> 16:18.727
Where is she?

16:18.727 --> 16:20.145
I don't know.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.855
I've looked everywhere
for her and I can't find her.

16:21.855 --> 16:25.275
Come to think of it,
I have not seen
Finn or Matteo either.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.361
Which explains why
my headache is gone.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.029
Where could they be?

16:29.446 --> 16:31.407
Well, you messed everything
else up today

16:31.407 --> 16:33.826
maybe you sent them back
instead of the wolverines.

16:34.785 --> 16:35.786
I hope not.

16:37.287 --> 16:38.914
Otherwise, the sack race
is going to turn
into a bloodbath.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.753
Well, they were nowhere else,
so they must be here.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.797
Wait, where is
the bouncy house?

16:46.797 --> 16:47.798
Didn't you tie it up?

out of my hair.

away from the dock!

swim back to shore.

are more pee than water.

what fish do in lakes.

with fish poop.

you fake passports.

but you're gonna have to
stay behind and take the fall.

I would be with
much cooler people.

hanging over the water!

If we can get closer to shore,

19:02.099 --> 19:03.976
maybe the house
can get stuck on it!

Awesome idea!

19:05.853 --> 19:07.020
How do we do that?

19:07.437 --> 19:09.439
We need to steer
this thing over there.

our way to the tree!

to the waterfall!

to have a little fun

that was a really smart move

21:18.819 --> 21:20.779
skipping the number two
when the branch broke.

21:21.697 --> 21:22.698
What?

21:27.911 --> 21:29.246
FINN AND MATTEO:
Ta-da!

21:29.621 --> 21:31.039
Oh, guys.

21:31.331 --> 21:33.709
You put everything back
together yourselves?

21:33.709 --> 21:34.793
Yup.

21:34.793 --> 21:37.087
We're sorry
for destroying
the cabin, Ravi.

21:37.379 --> 21:38.922
Can you ever forgive us?

21:38.922 --> 21:40.007
Of course.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.301
After all, I am
the Camp's Coolest Counselor,

21:42.301 --> 21:43.343
or "Triple C."

21:45.345 --> 21:47.055
You know, if you guys
start calling me that,

21:47.055 --> 21:48.181
it might catch on.

21:48.181 --> 21:50.392
You got it, Triple C!

21:52.227 --> 21:55.105
We're not really gonna
start calling him that,

21:55.105 --> 21:56.231
are we?

21:56.231 --> 21:57.774
Just give him this one.

21:57.774 --> 21:59.109
He has so little.

22:03.238 --> 22:05.657
There. You're back home
where you belong, Woody.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.034
Thanks, Emma.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.160
(WOODY VOICE) Thank you, Emma.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.038
(AS LOU) Who's a polite
woodchuck in a cute hat?

22:11.038 --> 22:13.040
(AS WOODY) I am.
(AS LOU) Yes, you are!

22:15.167 --> 22:16.209
Lou, I'm sorry.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.171
I was just trying
to make the camp better,
and I got carried away.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.381
Can you forgive me?

22:21.381 --> 22:22.382
Of course.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.135
But I could forgive you
a lot faster if you gave
me a raise.

22:25.844 --> 22:26.845
Don't push it.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.181
And

22:29.639 --> 22:30.724
done.

22:31.141 --> 22:32.225
Wow.

22:32.225 --> 22:34.352
We really did
a great job decorating.

22:34.770 --> 22:35.771
Yeah,

22:36.229 --> 22:38.440
and it was fun
doing it together.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.442
Hey!

22:40.442 --> 22:43.278
That would be a great spot
for my Hunter Hayes poster!

22:43.278 --> 22:46.323
Oh, no,
that's for my sweetie,
Blake Shelton!

22:46.323 --> 22:49.242
Or as I call him,
Mr. Zuri Ross.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.704
Only old people listen
to Blake Shelton!

22:53.038 --> 22:54.122
What's next?

22:54.122 --> 22:56.416
Plastic wrap
on the furniture, Grandma?

22:57.626 --> 22:58.710
Lou,

22:58.710 --> 23:00.212
I'm gonna need
that gavel again.

23:05.383 --> 23:08.303
Well, my time as leader
got off to a rocky start,

23:08.303 --> 23:10.847
but I still think
we can make this
the best camp ever.

23:10.847 --> 23:12.224
I know we can.

23:12.224 --> 23:15.435
And making this fire pit
run on gas was a great idea!

23:15.435 --> 23:18.230
I even added
a little extra juice
so can make

23:18.230 --> 23:21.399
scores of s'mores
for senoritas and senors.

23:23.485 --> 23:24.486
Sorry.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.363
I rhyme when I'm excited.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.074
Everyone, get your
marshmallows ready!

23:30.492 --> 23:32.285
Okay, here we go.

23:36.540 --> 23:40.043
Well, my marshmallow may not
be gooey, but my corneas are.

23:41.461 --> 23:42.212
Too much juice?

23:43.171 --> 23:44.256
Little bit.
