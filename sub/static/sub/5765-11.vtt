WEBVTT

00:01.130 --> 00:02.165
Previously on The Good Wife:
The State

00:02.200 --> 00:05.169
has recently received evidence
that the defendant

00:05.200 --> 00:07.794
has attempted to interfere
with the judicial process.

00:07.840 --> 00:09.398
JUDGE WINTER:
Bail is hereby denied.

00:09.440 --> 00:10.805
I thought I'd be leaving
with you.

00:10.840 --> 00:11.659
It's a betrayal.

00:11.710 --> 00:13.803
GRACE:
Maybe it's from Mom's work.

00:13.840 --> 00:15.774
This is getting crazy.

00:15.810 --> 00:18.199
Is that Dad?
They're just trying
to scare Mom.

00:18.250 --> 00:20.343
GRACE:
Maybe there's a reason
she should be scared.

00:20.380 --> 00:22.109
Do we tell Mom?

00:22.150 --> 00:24.186
They sent them to hurt her,
so I say no.

00:25.190 --> 00:26.657
(theme music plays)

00:26.690 --> 00:28.180
Hello, America.
I'm Duke Roscoe.

00:28.220 --> 00:30.552
As always,
I swear to tell the truth,

00:30.590 --> 00:32.626
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

00:32.660 --> 00:35.629
I turned away from
my shopping cart for a second,

00:35.660 --> 00:36.661
and she was gone.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.622
Three months ago,
two-year-old

00:38.670 --> 00:40.228
Jamie Willens disappeared.

00:40.270 --> 00:42.830
Her mother Cheryl claimed
she was snatched

00:42.870 --> 00:45.464
from her shopping cart
in a Chicago grocery store.

00:45.510 --> 00:47.171
Someone kidnapped my baby girl.

00:47.210 --> 00:49.474
The police looked
high and low for Jamie

00:49.510 --> 00:52.149
and this mysterious kidnapper.

00:52.180 --> 00:54.444
If you have Jamie, please...
please bring her home.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.345
And they found nothing. Why?

00:56.390 --> 00:59.154
Because she's lying, people!

00:59.190 --> 01:00.817
She killed her kid.

01:00.860 --> 01:03.658
Shorter clips.
Make it shorter clips.

01:03.690 --> 01:05.658
Grab the attention
of the jury.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.329
Cheryl Willens killed her baby,
and I have learned the reason

01:08.360 --> 01:10.590
Ms. Willens was
in the store at all:

01:10.630 --> 01:12.734
to buy condoms.

01:12.770 --> 01:13.589
Don't need that.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.733
Just cut it off
at "killed her baby."

01:15.770 --> 01:17.829
...Chery| Willens' freedom,

01:17.870 --> 01:21.135
the murdering mom
took her own life,

01:21.180 --> 01:23.569
hanging herself
from her closet door.

01:23.610 --> 01:25.544
He's a prince, isn't he?

01:25.580 --> 01:26.842
The gift that keeps on giving.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.370
Do you have him from last night?

01:28.420 --> 01:30.285
Uh...
The last file.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.117
WILL:
Aw, come on, you
know you're just

01:32.160 --> 01:34.082
managing a disaster here.

01:34.820 --> 01:36.287
It's the network lawyer

01:36.330 --> 01:38.890
making one last stab
at a settlement.

01:38.930 --> 01:40.727
You've been
shedding advertisers

01:40.760 --> 01:42.364
like a dog sheds fleas.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.868
WOMAN:
Good thing we have
a lot of fleas to shed.

01:44.900 --> 01:46.788
You really want to go to court?

01:46.840 --> 01:48.239
Your client committed suicide,

01:48.270 --> 01:50.158
and you're just looking
for someone to blame.

01:50.210 --> 01:53.134
And anyway, I just got in
from LA. and ordered a massage.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.171
Why would I want to go back
so fast?

01:55.210 --> 01:57.804
What are you doing
at that network aanay?

01:57.850 --> 02:00.341
You used to be the cool one
with all the tattoos.

02:00.380 --> 02:01.415
I'm still the cool one.

02:01.450 --> 02:02.678
Shh. I'm listening
to your client.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.483
DUKE (on TV):
You know what?

02:04.520 --> 02:06.750
I'm glad she's dead.

02:06.790 --> 02:07.859
That's right,

02:07.890 --> 02:11.223
because the more guilty people
who commit suicide,

02:11.260 --> 02:13.728
the less will crowd the courts.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.228
Intent,
disregard.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.693
You've got a client
that's out of control, Emily.

02:18.730 --> 02:21.267
He's not my client;
the network is my client.

02:21.300 --> 02:23.200
Yeah, well, tell your client

02:23.240 --> 02:24.867
their spokesman is
doing everything he can

02:24.910 --> 02:27.208
to raise the settlement amount--
right now we're at...

02:27.640 --> 02:29.198
...$3 million.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.603
After Duke's show tonight,
my guess is

02:30.650 --> 02:31.878
it'll be up to five.

02:31.910 --> 02:33.116
Give me a call.

02:33.150 --> 02:36.210
We're not in a position
to be charging retail.
Don't worry,

02:36.250 --> 02:37.217
she'll come in at 2.5.

02:37.250 --> 02:38.683
Will that be enough?

02:38.720 --> 02:40.256
He wants to go to trial.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.758
Talk to him-- tell
him how unpredictable

02:42.790 --> 02:44.280
a trial is.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.922
WILL:
Yeah, Cary, just roll
back that one piece.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.723
I want to see what
I missed before.

02:47.760 --> 02:48.795
Yeah, I want to go...

02:48.830 --> 02:51.958
Just, uh, want to be ready
for cross-examination.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.299
I figure he'll try to make me
out to be a money-grubber.

02:55.340 --> 02:56.238
Don't you think?

02:56.270 --> 02:58.238
Tim, I don't think
we want to go to trial.

02:58.270 --> 02:59.737
Why?
It's hard _to
go up against

02:59.780 --> 03:01.668
Duke's right of free speech.

03:01.710 --> 03:05.874
Yes, but, we'll... we'll have
the jury's sympathy, right?

03:05.910 --> 03:07.446
We're more
likely to get

03:07.480 --> 03:09.209
a fair settlement_ if
we don't go to trIal.

03:10.490 --> 03:13.653
But a trial will keep
Jamie's face out there.

03:13.690 --> 03:15.385
I know she's been missing
a year and a half,

03:15.420 --> 03:17.729
but I still think
my daughter's alive.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.523
You know he's still on the TV

03:19.560 --> 03:21.528
saying that my wife
is burning in Hell?

03:21.560 --> 03:22.993
I know.

03:23.030 --> 03:25.260
And people say,
"Don't watch it."

03:25.300 --> 03:28.736
But he has fans, and...

03:28.770 --> 03:30.965
people still phoning me.

03:33.380 --> 03:36.838
(choked up):
And I don't have a TV show,

03:36.880 --> 03:40.543
and I don't have anybody
to listen to me.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.349
And I can answer him in court.

03:45.390 --> 03:48.553
Tim, you don't want
to be obsessing on this.

03:48.590 --> 03:50.353
You talked about using
that settlement money

03:50.390 --> 03:52.927
to search for your daughter.

03:55.400 --> 03:59.734
If we settle now,
that's money you could use.

03:59.770 --> 04:02.307
If you go to court, I don't
know if you'll ever...

04:02.340 --> 04:04.262
You think I should do this?

04:04.310 --> 04:05.663
Settle?

04:05.710 --> 04:06.836
Yeah.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.278
What happened?

04:15.320 --> 04:16.947
Lots. Where were you?

04:16.990 --> 04:18.014
Oh, with Tim.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.859
That's right.
How is he?

04:19.890 --> 04:21.687
He's fine.
What happened?

04:21.720 --> 04:25.383
Yeah, yeah, come on, come on,
I'll get you caught up.

04:25.430 --> 04:27.421
The network lawyers
are coming over in an hour.

04:27.460 --> 04:30.327
That clip from last night
really did the trick.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.019
They're settling?

04:32.070 --> 04:33.662
Conference room
In an hour.

04:33.700 --> 04:36.305
I don't even think
they watch theIr own show.

04:36.340 --> 04:38.331
They're afraid
of the bad publicity.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.471
I'm borrowing you.

04:43.510 --> 04:45.068
Yo
ul
re.. ?

04:45.110 --> 04:46.475
I'm sorry.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.670
Kettle corn for you.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.041
Tell him to wait, Margie.

04:51.090 --> 04:53.456
David Lee. Family law.

04:53.490 --> 04:55.378
Oh, right. I'm so sorry.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.819
You're the divorce lawyer.

04:56.860 --> 04:58.657
Yes, I'm the divorce lawyer.

04:58.690 --> 05:01.591
Uh, yes, well,
let him read a magazine.

05:01.630 --> 05:02.961
We're starting up
a softball league,

05:03.000 --> 05:05.798
and I want to know if you're up
for playing first base?

05:06.940 --> 05:07.929
Joking.

05:07.970 --> 05:09.665
I need you at
a meet and greet

05:09.710 --> 05:11.632
in 45 minutes
to hand-hold a client.

05:11.670 --> 05:13.433
Upstairs.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.402
Oh, uh, wait, um,

05:15.440 --> 05:17.442
I've got a settlement
on the Duke Roscoe case

05:17.480 --> 05:20.074
in an hour, so...
Yes, at the moment,
we're the only department

05:20.120 --> 05:22.441
that makes money, so we outrank.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.412
See you in 45 minutes.

05:26.890 --> 05:28.084
(angry grunt)

05:28.120 --> 05:30.452
(door slams shut)

05:30.490 --> 05:32.128
(exhales)

05:32.160 --> 05:34.822
Did you want this closed?

05:34.860 --> 05:37.624
I'm tired of being the one who
has to hand-hold the clients.

05:37.670 --> 05:40.491
You know, they send me
off to get a client to
agree to do something

05:40.540 --> 05:41.996
I-I'm not even involved with,

05:42.040 --> 05:44.429
because they send me off
to hand-hold the client.

05:44.470 --> 05:45.732
You're babbling.

05:45.770 --> 05:47.977
I know. Thank you.

05:48.010 --> 05:50.103
Look, it's not a conspiracy.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.799
You're good at it.

05:51.850 --> 05:55.013
That's what my brother used
to say to get me to do chores:

05:55.050 --> 05:56.483
"Alicia's good at it."

05:56.520 --> 05:57.748
I've worked

05:57.790 --> 06:00.884
two months on this Duke case,
and now that they're settling,

06:00.920 --> 06:04.128
I'm off on some divorce case,
and Cary gets all the glory.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.787
Yeah.

06:05.830 --> 06:07.092
Life stinks.

06:07.130 --> 06:08.427
Doon

06:10.600 --> 06:12.568
EMILY (sighs):
Okay... we don't need

06:12.600 --> 06:14.659
to make this any
bigger than it is.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.736
The network doesn't want a long,
drawn out trial.

06:16.770 --> 06:18.135
We would like to move on.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.808
You mean from
Cheryl Willens' suicide

06:19.840 --> 06:21.478
or the loss of ten sponsors?

06:21.510 --> 06:23.546
You don't need to sell
anymore; we're here.

06:23.580 --> 06:26.469
That wasn't selling;
that was rubbing it in.
Over the phone,

06:26.520 --> 06:28.511
Will and I talked
about $2 million.

06:28.550 --> 06:30.518
Actually, we talked
about $3 million

06:30.550 --> 06:31.642
and a retraction.

06:31.690 --> 06:34.113
Oh. I must have misheard.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.583
The network might be
able to go to 2.5,

06:36.630 --> 06:39.519
but any retraction
would have to be worked
out separately wnth Duke.

06:39.560 --> 06:41.198
We only advise on content.

06:41.230 --> 06:43.562
Well, then you might
have to throw in...

06:43.600 --> 06:45.465
something extra?
Then...

06:45.500 --> 06:47.036
let's haggle.

06:47.070 --> 06:49.061
(indistinct talking)

06:51.810 --> 06:55.735
DAVID:
Mind you, I've had my share
of vengeful husbands as well.

06:55.780 --> 06:57.441
Alicia, there you are.

06:57.480 --> 06:58.572
Carla Browning.

06:58.610 --> 07:00.578
Hello, Mrs. Florrick.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.212
I think I'm a fan.

07:02.250 --> 07:04.741
Thank you. I think.

07:04.790 --> 07:06.815
Chocolate raisins?

07:06.860 --> 07:08.589
No, thank you.

07:08.620 --> 07:09.928
It's funny,

07:09.960 --> 07:12.224
most divorce lavwers
have Kleenex.

07:12.260 --> 07:14.194
Yes. I find it harder
for my clients to cry

07:14.230 --> 07:16.664
when their mouths
are filled with M&M'S.

07:16.700 --> 07:19.464
Have you been to many divorce
attorneys, Ms. Browning?

07:19.500 --> 07:21.092
A few.

07:21.140 --> 07:24.007
My husband and I seem to have
a series of relapses--

07:24.040 --> 07:26.531
him swearing to change,
me forgiving,

07:26.580 --> 07:28.502
him forgetting,
both of us repeating.

07:28.540 --> 07:29.768
I think I'm done.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.646
Morning.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.582
Point me in the direction
of the settlement conference.

07:40.620 --> 07:42.588
I moved out
about a week ago,

07:42.630 --> 07:44.484
and he's been calling
at all hours.

07:44.530 --> 07:46.691
DUKE:
Morning.
Threatening calls,

07:46.730 --> 07:48.857
saying inappropriate things

07:48.900 --> 07:51.528
to our sons.
DAVID:
I understand.

07:51.570 --> 07:55.028
But I must warn you,
filing for a restraining order

07:55.070 --> 07:57.061
against your husband
could set the stage

07:57.110 --> 07:58.998
for a very ugly divorce.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.905
Mr. Roscoe,
we didn't expect you.

08:00.940 --> 08:03.943
Don't get up-- I'll
just, uh, help myself

08:03.980 --> 08:05.504
back here.

08:05.550 --> 08:07.177
EMILY:
We would need
Mr. Willens to agree

08:07.220 --> 08:08.847
to not speak to the
press, of course.

08:08.880 --> 08:09.949
You got any cream cheese?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.719
Jennette?

08:11.750 --> 08:14.617
Can you get some cream cheese
for Mr. Roscoe, please?

08:14.660 --> 08:16.958
And, uh, fruit.
Uh, pineapple.

08:16.990 --> 08:19.129
Pineapple, too.
And a bib.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.252
JENNE'I'I'E:
Got it.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.858
Mr. Willens would have to agree

08:21.900 --> 08:24.619
(plate clatters loudly)
to no future
CIVII action.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.228
All this is outlined

08:26.270 --> 08:28.636
in paragraph six, um,

08:28.670 --> 08:30.001
if you'd take a look
at that paragraph right there.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.302
I just want to add

08:31.340 --> 08:33.308
that there will be no formal
retraction agreement,

08:33.340 --> 08:35.638
and the amount is
subject to change...

08:35.680 --> 08:37.602
I'm curious--
what is the amount?

08:37.650 --> 08:38.776
How much you guys paying?

08:38.810 --> 08:40.311
$2.5 million.

08:40.350 --> 08:42.215
Whoa.

08:42.250 --> 08:46.016
Wow. Is Mr. Willens
gonna be paying that
out of his own pocket,

08:46.050 --> 08:48.109
or is your law firm
gonna be helping him out?

08:48.160 --> 08:50.048
Mr. Roscoe.
Hmm?

08:50.090 --> 08:51.284
The network

08:51.330 --> 08:54.891
would prefer to handle
this... quietly.

08:54.930 --> 08:56.625
Love quietly.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.321
That's why I'm gonna
say this quietly.

08:59.370 --> 09:02.191
(quietly):
If the network pays

09:02.240 --> 09:04.003
one red commie cent,

09:04.040 --> 09:05.598
I'm gonna quit the network,

09:05.640 --> 09:08.108
and I'm gonna take
my nine million viewers with me.

09:08.140 --> 09:10.608
IfI have to broadcast
from a barge

09:10.650 --> 09:12.242
off the coast
of South Carolina,

09:12.280 --> 09:14.214
I'll do it,

09:14.250 --> 09:17.139
rather than surrender
my right of free speech.

09:18.820 --> 09:21.084
This isn't about revenge.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.224
I don't want to hear
any more excuses, all right?!

09:23.260 --> 09:25.148
My husband is
a very dangerous man,

09:25.190 --> 09:26.726
and I'm scared.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.250
You understand that,
don't you,

09:28.300 --> 09:29.619
Mrs. Florrick?

09:29.670 --> 09:30.762
Ido?

09:30.800 --> 09:31.721
About my husband.

09:31.770 --> 09:33.738
DUKE:
That was meant to
be a compliment.

09:33.770 --> 09:36.637
Hush money? Making
me look like...
Um... who is your husband?

09:36.670 --> 09:38.365
Oh, I thought David told you.

09:38.410 --> 09:41.800
And I just assumed.
Alicia, I'm sorry.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.740
My married name
isn't Browning.

09:43.780 --> 09:45.202
It's Childs.

09:45.250 --> 09:47.115
Her husband is Glenn Childs,

09:47.150 --> 09:49.038
the state's attorney.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.741
DUKE: ...and they're not
going to be very happy!
Oh.

09:50.790 --> 09:54.180
Carla thought
you'd be sympathetic.

09:54.220 --> 09:56.723
CARLA:
David is being euphemistic.

09:56.760 --> 09:57.920
Given how Glenn's been acting,

09:57.960 --> 09:59.951
I thought I'd need
a secret weapon.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.662
DUKE:
Come on!
And that would be me?

10:02.700 --> 10:04.725
Yes.

10:06.740 --> 10:07.832
Don't tell me
to sit down!

10:07.870 --> 10:10.065
Okay.
I don't want
to sit down!

10:10.110 --> 10:14.103
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

10:28.420 --> 10:31.127
PETER:
The appeal is looking good.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.718
We may not even need
to put you on the stand.

10:32.760 --> 10:35.422
The more I can
make this a battle

10:35.460 --> 10:40.159
between Childs and me and
not about sex, then I win.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.690
Sounds smart.

10:41.740 --> 10:43.002
What's the matter?

10:43.040 --> 10:45.008
What happens next?

10:45.040 --> 10:46.928
You win the appeal and...?

10:46.980 --> 10:48.777
And I get a new trial.

10:48.810 --> 10:50.744
Right. You get bond.

10:52.780 --> 10:55.044
I want to go home, Alicia.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.741
What does that look like?

10:56.790 --> 10:58.781
Home? What does
it look like?

10:58.820 --> 11:01.186
Looks like family.

11:01.220 --> 11:03.256
And you want to run again?

11:03.290 --> 11:07.056
I don't know.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.397
People want me to run.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.433
I'm working on a divorce case,
Peter, and I just...

11:17.040 --> 11:20.237
I see how easily people
fall back into old habits.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.805
But that won't happen to us.

11:22.850 --> 11:23.805
Why won't we?

11:23.850 --> 11:27.809
Because we see the problem.

11:27.850 --> 11:29.738
And we'll know how to avoid it.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.285
I have to go.

11:51.510 --> 11:54.104
BAILIFF: All rise for
the Honorable Judge Abernathy.

11:54.140 --> 11:55.368
ABERNATHY:
Uh, no, no.

11:55.410 --> 11:58.174
Please, everybody, sit.

12:00.150 --> 12:01.913
My goodness.

12:01.950 --> 12:03.383
We're crowded today.

12:03.420 --> 12:05.945
I think that, uh, has something
to do with me, Your Honor.

12:05.990 --> 12:09.414
Yes, Mr. Roscoe,
I do believe you're right.

12:09.460 --> 12:11.382
Well, you're welcome.

12:11.430 --> 12:12.829
Thank you, Your Honor.

12:12.860 --> 12:15.021
All I want is a fair shake,
even though, uh,

12:15.060 --> 12:16.254
I would imagine
our politics,

12:16.300 --> 12:18.063
uh, are night and day.

12:18.100 --> 12:21.490
Your Honor, is Duke
representing himself here?

12:21.540 --> 12:23.428
ABERNATHY: No, no,
it's all right, Mr. Gardner.

12:23.470 --> 12:27.008
A smidgen of informality
is, uh, allowed us all.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.429
And yes, Mr. Roscoe,
I clearly admit

12:29.480 --> 12:31.243
that we probably would
agree on very little,

12:31.280 --> 12:35.944
but this court is a blind court,
and I will endeavor to be fair.

12:35.980 --> 12:37.413
Thank you.

12:37.450 --> 12:39.338
(quietly):
Talk about playing the refs.

12:39.390 --> 12:40.948
Yep, he's good.

12:40.990 --> 12:42.548
Your Honor, the defense moves
for a summary dismissal

12:42.590 --> 12:44.057
based on the
First Amendment.

12:44.090 --> 12:46.558
The plaintiff would deny
Mr. Roscoe the right

12:46.590 --> 12:48.194
to speak his mind...
No, Your Honor.

12:50.830 --> 12:53.264
DUKE: The truth is an
absolute defense.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.268
I've been nothing but truthful
about that child killer.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.439
WILL: Your Honor,
if you're gonna yell "fire"

12:57.470 --> 13:00.075
in a crowded theater, there
damn well better be a fire.

13:00.110 --> 13:01.577
Okay, Counselors, thank you.

13:01.610 --> 13:03.805
Uh, a second.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.370
(quietly): It's like Lucy
with the football.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.341
He's gonna screw us again.

13:09.550 --> 13:14.385
Mr. Gardner, you argue
that the First Amendment

13:14.420 --> 13:17.548
guarantees the right to speak
but not the right to lie.

13:17.590 --> 13:20.457
I agree
with that statement.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.456
But our case
will be decided on

13:22.500 --> 13:24.889
very narrow grounds,
Mr. Gardner, Ms. Lockhart.

13:24.930 --> 13:27.467
Uh, to use your example,
it's not enough to prove

13:27.500 --> 13:29.468
that there was no fire
in the theater.

13:29.500 --> 13:30.307
You must also prove

13:30.340 --> 13:33.503
that Mr. Roscoe knew
there was no fire

13:33.540 --> 13:36.304
or had a reckless disregard
for the facts.

13:36.340 --> 13:38.149
DIANE:
Okay, Cary, Kalinda,

13:38.180 --> 13:40.546
this now turns into
a fact-finding case.

13:40.580 --> 13:43.185
Who was leaking Duke
all his information

13:43.220 --> 13:44.915
in the police
investigation?

13:44.950 --> 13:46.383
We need to find out
what he was given

13:46.420 --> 13:48.388
so we can prove he was lying.

13:48.420 --> 13:49.557
Oh, and, Alicia,

13:49.590 --> 13:50.727
you keep on Tim.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.557
Hand-hold him, make sure he
stays on the reservation.

13:52.590 --> 13:53.488
WILL:
Actually, AllCla needs to

13:53.530 --> 13:55.395
split her time
with the Childs' divorce.

13:55.430 --> 13:56.397
Oh, right.

13:56.430 --> 13:57.465
Okay, Cary, you stay with him.

13:57.500 --> 13:58.319
Hand-hold him.

13:58.370 --> 14:01.464
DUKE:
Yes. The woman is a murderer.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.489
Nothing else matters.

14:02.540 --> 14:05.566
Look, we all want
to save face here,

14:05.610 --> 14:07.475
so let's chat.

14:07.510 --> 14:09.978
Outside the spotlight; Duke
can't know; just you and me.

14:10.010 --> 14:12.547
And if any money changes hands,
it's out of the press.

14:12.580 --> 14:15.174
Can we have a secret handshake?

14:15.220 --> 14:16.915
8:00 tonight, my hotel.

14:16.950 --> 14:20.056
Mm.
DUKE:
Cheryl Willens killed her child.

14:22.090 --> 14:24.081
(four gunshots)

14:27.100 --> 14:29.352
Your spray pattern's
like a fingerprint, K.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.594
Hi, Frank.

14:30.630 --> 14:32.621
What do you need?

14:32.670 --> 14:34.638
Why do you think
I need anything?

14:34.670 --> 14:38.060
There's eight open alleys,
you're in the one next to me.

14:38.110 --> 14:40.533
Willens kidnapping,
everything you got.

14:41.580 --> 14:44.174
And what do I get out of it?

14:44.210 --> 14:46.508
Satisfaction from
doing the right thing.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.438
It's an ongoing
investigation.

14:51.620 --> 14:53.383
The Lindbergh baby
is an ongoing investigation.

14:54.390 --> 14:55.357
What do you need?

14:55.390 --> 14:57.085
The 911 tapes?

14:59.130 --> 15:01.553
Yeah, the 911 tapes.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.295
And the investigative reports.

15:03.330 --> 15:05.093
They're under lock and key.

15:05.130 --> 15:06.165
Upstairs is upset

15:06.200 --> 15:07.565
that someone's leaking
this stuff

15:07.600 --> 15:10.068
to Duke Roscoe.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.099
Okay.

15:11.140 --> 15:13.438
Two shots; whoever hits closest.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.504
I win,

15:14.540 --> 15:15.609
you give me
everything.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.541
911 and the reports.

15:18.580 --> 15:20.116
And if I win?

15:23.350 --> 15:25.147
Okay, you first.

15:27.590 --> 15:29.012
Go for it.

15:32.630 --> 15:34.427
Not bad. Your turn.

15:37.330 --> 15:40.458
That's right,
you're a heart man, Frank.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.092
Put up or shut up, K.

15:53.380 --> 15:55.268
Let me start by saying,
although this office

15:55.320 --> 15:57.015
may not have the trappings
of a courtroom,

15:57.050 --> 15:59.211
both parties have agreed
to arbitration,

15:59.250 --> 16:02.117
and as such, my decisions
have the force of law.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.980
Do both parties understand?

16:04.030 --> 16:05.725
We seem to be
only one party.

16:05.760 --> 16:06.681
As you know,
Mrs. Childs,

16:06.730 --> 16:09.290
your husband is a busy man.

16:09.330 --> 16:11.059
He's asked me,
as his lead attorney,

16:11.100 --> 16:12.465
to handle matters in his stead.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.695
There are no matters
to handle in his stead.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.731
You signed a prenuptial
agreement, Mrs. Childs.

16:16.770 --> 16:19.705
The only matter to discuss
is when are you moving out.

16:19.740 --> 16:20.604
The matter to discuss

16:20.640 --> 16:23.143
is the amount of
Carla's spousal support

16:23.180 --> 16:25.375
and whether she's going
to allow Mr. Childs

16:25.410 --> 16:26.672
to visit his
children at all.

16:26.710 --> 16:28.746
You seem to be
taking for granted

16:28.780 --> 16:32.682
that my client would ignore
a legally-executed contract.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.688
Why would he do that,
Mrs. Childs?

16:34.720 --> 16:36.585
Because of her.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.326
Tell your client

16:38.360 --> 16:40.396
that if he
doesn't make it

16:40.430 --> 16:42.591
to our next arbitration,
I will tell Mrs. Florrick

16:42.630 --> 16:44.598
what I found on his laptop.

16:44.630 --> 16:46.769
Is that supposed to scare him?

16:46.800 --> 16:48.597
Yes.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.109
So you're using me
for leverage.

17:03.150 --> 17:04.742
Yes.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.314
Does that make you
uncomfortable?

17:06.350 --> 17:08.659
It makes me mistrustful.

17:08.690 --> 17:11.079
So use me back.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.259
I know exactly
what you're going through.

17:19.300 --> 17:22.394
I... my uncle died.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.135
Hardest day of my life.

17:24.170 --> 17:26.434
Ruptured ulcer.

17:26.470 --> 17:28.836
The whole... the...

17:28.880 --> 17:30.370
(sighs)

17:30.410 --> 17:31.809
God.

17:31.850 --> 17:34.410
Then my aunt insisted on having
an open casket.

17:34.450 --> 17:36.213
I have no idea why.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.639
To get to see
the dead body?

17:43.760 --> 17:45.625
GLENN:
You are playing with fire.

17:45.660 --> 17:46.752
Who let you in here?

17:46.790 --> 17:48.348
It's my family.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.697
Let me show you the way out,
Mr. Childs.

17:49.730 --> 17:50.822
You're poisoning her
against me.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.360
You want to talk to me,

17:52.400 --> 17:54.766
you phone my assistant and
you make an appointment,

17:54.800 --> 17:55.835
but don't you ever
come into my office

17:55.870 --> 17:57.667
without my
permission.
You know, she was fine.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.564
Carla was happy
until you talked to her.

17:59.610 --> 18:01.532
(laughs):
Oh, my God.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.808
Are you blind?

18:02.840 --> 18:04.546
I have two sons.
Don't you touch me!

18:04.580 --> 18:05.444
I have a life!

18:05.480 --> 18:06.401
You know those envelopes
on your doorstep--

18:06.450 --> 18:08.748
they're just the beginning.
I have a lot more.

18:08.780 --> 18:09.712
I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:09.750 --> 18:11.718
Don't play stupid with me.

18:11.750 --> 18:12.887
Those photos, the DVDs--

18:12.920 --> 18:14.717
I have eight years
of evidence.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.784
Then use it!

18:15.820 --> 18:16.787
Who's stopping you?

18:16.820 --> 18:17.889
Security, 27th floor, please.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.557
(scoffs)

18:19.590 --> 18:20.693
You want to make this
about family?

18:20.730 --> 18:23.164
Fine. I can make it
about family, too.

18:36.380 --> 18:37.369
EMILY:
Look, well,

18:37.410 --> 18:40.174
your only play is to win
the sympathy of the jury.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.745
They get so outraged,
they ignore jury instructions,

18:42.780 --> 18:44.680
and they award
your poor widower something.

18:44.720 --> 18:45.789
Actually, I have
another play.

18:45.820 --> 18:46.889
Hmm?

18:46.920 --> 18:48.911
I make your network
look so bad,

18:48.960 --> 18:50.621
they pay the four million.

18:50.660 --> 18:52.355
Four million, is it now?

18:52.390 --> 18:53.698
Uh-huh, and that's cheap.
Mm.

18:53.730 --> 18:55.459
Did I tell you
I just got a 911 tape

18:55.500 --> 18:57.161
of a distraught Cheryl Willens
phoning the police

18:57.200 --> 18:58.519
about her missing daughter?

19:01.640 --> 19:02.789
Now I know you're bluffing.

19:02.840 --> 19:03.909
Yep.

19:03.940 --> 19:06.602
Just me and a tape recorder
doing a great imitation

19:06.640 --> 19:09.279
of a panicked mom.

19:09.310 --> 19:11.744
So did it hurt
to have it removed?

19:12.810 --> 19:14.846
Your tattoo.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.370
No, it's still there.

19:16.420 --> 19:18.581
Makeup.

19:18.620 --> 19:19.917
You're kidding.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.315
Nope.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.554
Delay the trial,

19:22.590 --> 19:25.286
ask for a continuance,

19:25.330 --> 19:27.958
let Duke's head cool and
I'll get you the two million.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.323
Nah, I think I'll take a chance
with this jury.

19:34.370 --> 19:36.793
I'll send you
the 911 tape.

19:36.840 --> 19:39.764
I was talking to Hannah Morris
back from the old firm.

19:39.810 --> 19:41.505
Wow.

19:41.540 --> 19:42.802
That really got
bigger, huh?

19:42.840 --> 19:44.478
It's my Monopoly board.

19:44.510 --> 19:46.205
I keep buying property.

19:46.250 --> 19:48.741
Hannah said you've been on
some kind of sexual sabbatical

19:48.780 --> 19:49.917
for the last six months.

19:49.950 --> 19:51.315
That's funny.

19:51.350 --> 19:52.817
Now, how would Hannah know that?

19:52.850 --> 19:55.455
The woman keeps tabs
on you, Will.

19:55.490 --> 19:57.822
How far down does it go?

19:57.860 --> 19:59.953
Pretty far.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.895
So we're not gonna get any
work done tonight, are we?

20:04.930 --> 20:06.659
That's up to you.

20:06.700 --> 20:08.691
Be right back.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.701
(cell phone ringing)

20:18.680 --> 20:19.840
Yeah, what's up, Diane?

20:19.880 --> 20:21.848
DIANE:
You near a TV?
Check out Duke.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.017
Why?

20:23.050 --> 20:24.779
What's he...
what's he saying now?

20:24.820 --> 20:27.015
I can't do it justice.

20:27.050 --> 20:29.382
DUKE (over TV):
...hypocrisy from a bunch of

20:29.420 --> 20:32.981
limo liberal lavwers
at Stern, Lockhart & Gardner.

20:33.030 --> 20:36.420
And as always,
I have left it to you,

20:36.460 --> 20:37.859
my civilian journalists

20:37.900 --> 20:39.868
to come up with something
on Will Gardner.

20:39.900 --> 20:41.868
Yeah, I get it;
he's got a big megaphone.

20:41.900 --> 20:45.267
So we just got to take it,
thick skin...

20:45.310 --> 20:47.574
Here's Will Gardner
sneaking Into a hotel room

20:47.610 --> 20:49.669
with the wife
of the hooker-loving,

20:49.710 --> 20:52.873
toe-sucking state's attorney,
Peter Florrick.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.515
There you go, Will.

20:56.550 --> 20:58.745
Truth is the absolute defense.

20:58.790 --> 20:59.848
(clucks tongue)

20:59.890 --> 21:02.415
Well, that explains
the sabbatical.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.920
It was that rape case,
the one we lost.

21:06.960 --> 21:08.689
We were asking
questions at the hotel.

21:08.730 --> 21:10.618
Seems perfectly innocent.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.297
Okay, can we do
some work now?

21:12.330 --> 21:13.490
I'm serious.

21:13.540 --> 21:14.996
It was that case,
Christy Barbosa.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.508
And of course it required
going to a hotel.

21:17.540 --> 21:18.962
We were asking questions.

21:19.010 --> 21:20.830
It's what led us to the witness.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.939
So you're sleeping
with Will?

21:29.950 --> 21:31.679
CHERYL:
Please, God, no, no!

21:31.720 --> 21:33.756
MAN (over earbuds):
Where is your location, ma'am?

21:33.790 --> 21:34.859
You need to tell me
your location.

21:34.890 --> 21:37.723
CHERYL:
Uh, a market.
I'm... I'm in Quick Mart.

21:37.760 --> 21:39.785
My-my baby, she's gone!

21:39.830 --> 21:42.048
MAN:
Okay, ma'am,
an officer is on the way.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.795
I'll need you
to stay on the line.

21:43.830 --> 21:45.366
CHERYL:
I told her she was bad.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.436
The last thing I to... Oh, God!

21:47.470 --> 21:49.335
She-she was crying and...

21:49.370 --> 21:52.669
Please, God, please!

21:52.710 --> 21:54.007
Oh, God! She was crying.
Please, God.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.337
Mom?

21:55.380 --> 21:57.029
You all right?

21:57.080 --> 21:57.876
Oh, yeah, yeah.

21:57.910 --> 22:00.708
I just, uh...
You couldn't sleep?

22:03.020 --> 22:05.443
Oh, sweetheart.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.014
How are you
doing at school?

22:07.050 --> 22:09.052
Good.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.928
Are you getting
a divorce?

22:12.960 --> 22:15.690
No, no. That's
just a case.

22:15.730 --> 22:17.664
Who's Will Gardner?

22:18.700 --> 22:20.122
Another Google alert?

22:20.170 --> 22:21.432
(quietly):
Yeah.

22:22.540 --> 22:24.064
It's just a misunderstanding.

22:24.110 --> 22:27.409
He's my boss. We were working
on a case, and we went

22:27.440 --> 22:29.431
to a hotel to ask
some questions.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.402
And now people are trying to
make it into something it's not.

22:31.450 --> 22:34.613
Zach says you went
to a divorce lawyer.

22:34.650 --> 22:36.572
Yes.

22:37.820 --> 22:40.948
When I was angry, a week
after everything happened.

22:40.990 --> 22:42.548
But you're not angry now?

22:42.590 --> 22:44.626
No.

22:46.130 --> 22:50.521
I'm just trying to
be... collected.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.996
All right.
Good night.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.007
Oh.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.838
Good night, sweetheart.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.973
Grace?

23:03.010 --> 23:05.103
Did anything come for me at the
apartment that I didn't get?

23:06.150 --> 23:07.879
Like what?

23:07.920 --> 23:10.047
I don't know.
A package or something?

23:12.150 --> 23:13.754
No.

23:13.790 --> 23:15.018
Good night.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.015
Good night, sweetheart.

23:22.100 --> 23:25.558
The 911 tape has
no probative value, Your Honor.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.194
It is a naked attempt to inflame
the passions of the jury,

23:28.240 --> 23:30.060
and gain sympathy
for his client.

23:30.100 --> 23:31.601
Cornerstone Of our case

23:31.640 --> 23:33.062
is that Duke Roscoe
was knowmgly wrong

23:33.110 --> 23:35.704
on the facts.
We need the 911 tape

23:35.740 --> 23:37.605
to show his facts were,
at the very least, wrong.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.743
Your Honor, I know you will
try to be impartial here

23:39.780 --> 23:41.077
despite your political
differences with my client.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.212
Oh, come on.
Stop playing the ref, all right?

23:42.250 --> 23:45.617
And stop carrying out
a jeremiad against my client.

23:45.650 --> 23:46.878
What?

23:46.920 --> 23:49.184
He obviously caught you
with your pants down,

23:49.220 --> 23:50.528
and now you want to...

23:50.560 --> 23:51.982
Okay, you two.

23:52.030 --> 23:53.088
Such fireworks here.

23:53.130 --> 23:54.449
Your Honor,

23:54.500 --> 23:56.991
all we ask for is a compromise.

23:57.030 --> 23:58.463
That will prove to us
your fairness.

23:58.500 --> 23:59.626
What compromise?

23:59.670 --> 24:01.968
Either we play the tape
or we don't.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.003
BAILIFF (reading):
"Please, God. No, no.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.200
My baby is gone. I..."

24:07.240 --> 24:08.832
Question:

24:08.880 --> 24:10.131
"I would like
to help you, ma'am,

24:10.180 --> 24:12.102
but I need your location."

24:12.150 --> 24:13.242
I want
to shoot myself.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.918
Answer: "Oh, God.

24:14.950 --> 24:16.110
"Oh, God.

24:16.150 --> 24:17.981
I need help now."

24:18.020 --> 24:21.888
Question:
"Ma'am, are you?"

24:21.920 --> 24:24.229
Answer:
"My God, my God."

24:24.260 --> 24:24.919
Unintelligible.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.019
The nice thing
about liberals,

24:27.060 --> 24:29.153
they love to compromise.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.168
Duke was clearly leaked
the police report.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.724
But_there are holes
in the report

24:32.770 --> 24:33.998
he's filling in
from other sources.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.029
What sources?

24:35.070 --> 24:36.662
I don't know. He has
a lot of anonymous sources

24:36.700 --> 24:37.837
on his Web site.

24:37.870 --> 24:40.976
Civilian journalists with
e-mails like PatrickHenry76,

24:41.010 --> 24:42.238
ReaganRules, TheDukesman.

24:42.280 --> 24:45.147
I say we put the son
of a bitch on the stand.

24:47.250 --> 24:49.718
Where am I going?

24:51.120 --> 24:53.145
Hey, Bob. Can you tell me
where I'm going?

24:53.190 --> 24:54.157
There's no
court hearing today.

24:54.190 --> 24:56.954
Am I moving cells?

24:56.990 --> 24:58.526
You are.

25:00.230 --> 25:01.754
Glenn.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.961
Peter.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.991
(men talking indistinctly)

25:07.200 --> 25:10.761
We're trying to end the coddling
of high-profile prisoners.

25:10.810 --> 25:13.529
So you're putting me in with
the general population, huh?

25:13.580 --> 25:15.730
Yes.

25:19.580 --> 25:21.946
It's a bit of a clumsy move,
isn't it, Glenn?

25:32.960 --> 25:34.951
You know,
even at our worst,

25:35.000 --> 25:36.922
we never went after
each other's families.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.292
I'm the one in prison.

25:39.330 --> 25:41.161
I'm not going after anyone.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.963
Hmm.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.809
I love my wife.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.933
I love my children.

25:46.970 --> 25:50.076
But your wife is leading her
toward a divorce.

25:50.110 --> 25:52.908
She's Carla's
divorce lawyer.

25:54.180 --> 25:56.319
(chuckles)

25:57.990 --> 25:59.218
Okay.

25:59.250 --> 26:01.309
So, now we want
the gloves to come off?

26:01.360 --> 26:03.248
I didn't know they weren't.

26:03.290 --> 26:05.724
So you've got me
in general population

26:05.760 --> 26:08.058
because my wife
is your wife's attorney?

26:11.900 --> 26:13.663
Hey, Glenn.

26:13.700 --> 26:15.361
You wanted the prize.

26:15.400 --> 26:18.301
You wanted the office.

26:18.340 --> 26:20.137
So enjoy the spoils.

26:28.380 --> 26:30.211
DUKE:
I swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

26:30.250 --> 26:32.889
and nothing but the truth.
So help me God.

26:35.820 --> 26:38.254
Mr. Roscoe,
on your show of August 15,

26:38.290 --> 26:41.123
did you say,
"Jamie Willens was never seen

26:41.160 --> 26:42.149
"on the convenience store video

26:42.200 --> 26:44.293
because her mother killed her
earlier that night."

26:44.330 --> 26:45.888
You have the transcript
right there in your hand,

26:45.930 --> 26:47.067
Mr. Gardner.

26:48.100 --> 26:51.809
I do, don't I?

26:51.840 --> 26:54.331
There you are.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.905
Yes, to the best of my memory,
Mr. Gardner,

26:56.940 --> 26:59.602
I said the words
you just there quoted.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.915
And this was on
the same program

27:02.950 --> 27:04.383
you accused the President
of the United States

27:04.420 --> 27:05.739
of being a terrorist.

27:05.790 --> 27:06.814
Objection, Your Honor.

27:06.850 --> 27:07.953
The answer is yes.

27:07.990 --> 27:09.014
(sighs)

27:09.060 --> 27:10.186
The answer to what is yes?

27:10.220 --> 27:11.448
Yes, that's
the same program

27:11.490 --> 27:14.220
where I called the President of
the United States a terrorist.

27:14.260 --> 27:15.249
And yes, Emily,

27:15.300 --> 27:18.929
I can see there are
black people on the jury.

27:18.970 --> 27:19.766
Thank you,
Mr. Roscoe.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.997
So, to the best of
your knowledge,

27:23.040 --> 27:26.134
do the Chicago police consider
Mrs. Willens a suspect

27:26.170 --> 27:27.728
in the disappearance
of her daughter?

27:27.780 --> 27:30.874
Isn't the PC term
"person of interest"?

27:30.910 --> 27:32.969
Let me just keep this
real simple for you.

27:33.010 --> 27:34.841
Knock once for yes.
(knocks once)

27:34.880 --> 27:37.110
Twice for no.
(knocks twme)

27:37.150 --> 27:39.948
Isn't anyone going to object?

27:41.290 --> 27:43.827
Okay, actually, I don't want
anyone knocking in my court.

27:43.860 --> 27:45.452
Now, Mr. Roscoe,

27:45.490 --> 27:48.197
when you publicly accused
Cheryl Willens of murder,

27:48.230 --> 27:50.198
what evidence did you have
that the prosecutors didn't?

27:50.230 --> 27:53.028
The prosecutor has
to convince the jury.

27:53.070 --> 27:55.732
I'm a commentator.
I only have to convmce myself.

27:55.770 --> 27:57.738
And_so once
you conVInce yourself,

27:57.770 --> 27:58.930
it's a fact?

27:58.970 --> 28:00.972
Yes.

28:01.980 --> 28:03.845
Look.

28:03.880 --> 28:07.839
I rely on the police records.
I also have other sources.

28:07.880 --> 28:09.472
How else would I know
that Cheryl Willens

28:09.520 --> 28:11.909
tried to get
a third trimester abortion?

28:11.950 --> 28:13.884
WILL:
What other sources?

28:13.920 --> 28:15.911
What?

28:15.960 --> 28:17.257
You just said
you have other sources.

28:17.290 --> 28:18.450
What other sources?

28:21.060 --> 28:22.095
Objection,

28:22.130 --> 28:23.199
Your Honor.

28:23.230 --> 28:24.788
Under the shield law
of Illinois,

28:24.830 --> 28:27.060
reporters do not have
to reveal their sources.

28:27.100 --> 28:28.294
But, Your Honor,
Mr. Roscoe just said

28:28.340 --> 28:29.898
he's a commentator,
not a reporter.

28:29.940 --> 28:31.931
EMILY:
I don't care what he said.

28:31.970 --> 28:34.473
Mr. Roscoe is a journalist.

28:34.510 --> 28:37.946
We respectfully ask the
court to compel Mr. Roscoe

28:37.980 --> 28:39.948
to reveal what other
information he received

28:39.980 --> 28:42.039
about Cheryl Willens
and where he got it.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.514
You're asking me to pierce
the shield law, Miss Lockhart?

28:44.550 --> 28:46.916
Your Honor,
US. v. Lewis "Scooter" Libby.

28:46.950 --> 28:49.987
The court ordered New York Times
reporter Judith Miller

28:50.020 --> 28:51.351
to reveal her sources.

28:51.390 --> 28:52.948
(chuckles)

28:52.990 --> 28:54.059
I never thought I'd see the day

28:54.100 --> 28:56.955
when you would side
with Bush and Cheney, Counselor.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.423
It is an established precedent,
Your Honor. That is all.

28:59.470 --> 29:01.859
Bizarre.

29:01.900 --> 29:05.063
Mr. Roscoe has managed

29:05.110 --> 29:06.338
to outmaneuver
you on the left.

29:06.370 --> 29:08.372
(sighs)

29:08.410 --> 29:09.900
I guess I'm overruling you,
Counselors.

29:09.940 --> 29:11.908
Mr. Roscoe, you may keep
your sources confidential.

29:11.950 --> 29:14.145
Thank you.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.245
TIM:
It's not true.

29:18.290 --> 29:21.111
Cheryl never tried
to get an abortion.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.809
Even

29:22.860 --> 29:24.179
Is it possible, Tim...

29:24.230 --> 29:26.528
and please excuse me
for asking the question

29:26.560 --> 29:27.925
because I know
we've really bonded

29:27.960 --> 29:29.427
over these
last few days.

29:29.460 --> 29:31.860
Is it possible
Cheryl kept it from you?

29:31.900 --> 29:34.198
No. Don't you see?

29:34.240 --> 29:36.094
Now you're buying
into Duke's lies, too.

29:36.140 --> 29:37.266
We just want to trace

29:37.300 --> 29:38.904
the source of the story.

29:38.940 --> 29:40.032
We need to show that Duke

29:40.070 --> 29:42.402
was being reckless
with the truth.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.408
Is there any truth to it?

29:44.450 --> 29:49.171
Look, I took her
to her clinic visits myself.

29:49.220 --> 29:50.346
All right, I would have known

29:50.380 --> 29:52.985
if she tried
to get a late-term abortion.

29:53.020 --> 29:54.453
Or any kind of abortion.

29:54.490 --> 29:55.787
Which clinic?

29:59.060 --> 30:00.482
GLENN:
I love you, Carla.

30:00.530 --> 30:03.988
Can't we work this out
Without all these people?

30:04.030 --> 30:05.964
David and Alicia
are my attorneys.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.265
How many divorces have you
handled, Mrs. Florrick?

30:09.300 --> 30:12.133
Actually, this
is my first one.

30:12.170 --> 30:13.933
Then I should carefully explain

30:13.980 --> 30:16.073
that when a wife signs
a prenuptial agreement,

30:16.110 --> 30:17.202
she has forfeited her ability...

30:17.240 --> 30:19.379
Alicia, you're probably
wondering how Glenn found out

30:19.410 --> 30:20.968
about Amber Madison.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.147
Carla!
I don't want him
to talk anymore.

30:23.180 --> 30:24.317
Ma'am, that's not for you
to determine.

30:24.350 --> 30:26.318
Shut up.

30:26.350 --> 30:28.056
Good.

30:28.090 --> 30:29.580
Now, I want you
to drop the prenup

30:29.620 --> 30:30.985
and negotiate
a fair settlement.

30:32.360 --> 30:34.920
It is a fair settlement.
So, on Glenn's computer,

30:34.960 --> 30:37.053
there's a file devoted
exclusively to Peter.

30:37.100 --> 30:39.989
Okay, okay. 20% of my assets?

30:40.030 --> 30:41.065
I keep the house.

30:42.570 --> 30:44.003
And something called
Triton Fields.

30:44.040 --> 30:45.905
GLENN:
Carla, this...

30:45.940 --> 30:47.134
this is illegal.
What are you going to do,

30:47.170 --> 30:48.432
arrest the mother
of your children?

30:52.610 --> 30:54.111
Okay to the house.

30:55.480 --> 30:58.119
Full custody.

30:59.650 --> 31:01.186
I need time.

31:01.220 --> 31:04.018
12 hours. And then
Alicia and I will sit down

31:04.060 --> 31:05.322
and have a nice,
long chat.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.426
(theme music plays)

31:12.470 --> 31:15.268
I'm so sure that Cheryl Willens
killed her daughter

31:15.300 --> 31:19.066
that I am now offering $100,000
from my own pocket...

31:19.110 --> 31:20.202
He's influencing the jury.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.333
You don't think one or two
of them are watching this?

31:22.380 --> 31:24.143
...to anybody who has even
a shred of evidence

31:24.180 --> 31:27.206
that Jamie Willens
is still alive.

31:27.250 --> 31:29.548
It's called the truth, folks.

31:29.580 --> 31:31.548
Look at Stern,
Lockhart & Gardner.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.410
Oh, here we go.

31:33.450 --> 31:34.587
_ That's what our citizen
journalists have been d0ing.

31:34.620 --> 31:36.212
They've been looking.

31:36.260 --> 31:39.559
Who has spent
the last two months in detox?

31:39.590 --> 31:41.148
Who has cheated
on their tax return?

31:41.200 --> 31:43.259
Who's a closeted lesbian?

31:43.300 --> 31:45.518
So, tune in tomorrow

31:45.570 --> 31:49.267
and we'll find out exactly who
has trouble facing the truth.

31:51.710 --> 31:53.564
Yeah, I remember Cheryl.

31:53.610 --> 31:56.499
Good girl. So sad
what happened.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.474
You did say you're
working with Tim Willens?

31:58.510 --> 32:01.047
Yeah, He wants to
clear her name.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.241
So, when did she
last come in?

32:03.280 --> 32:05.180
March '07,
her third trimester.

32:05.220 --> 32:06.209
Her third?

32:06.250 --> 32:08.411
Was that a
regular exam?

32:08.460 --> 32:10.587
Cheryl was spotting.

32:10.620 --> 32:12.178
Nothing unusual,

32:12.230 --> 32:14.721
but the poor girl was so
afraid of losing her baby

32:14.760 --> 32:17.320
that she didn't even
tell Tim about it.

32:17.360 --> 32:18.691
Do you know
of anyone here

32:18.730 --> 32:20.618
who'd say she was having
a late-term abortion?

32:20.670 --> 32:21.989
No.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.462
What about others?

32:23.500 --> 32:26.162
Cleaning crew, volunteers,

32:26.210 --> 32:28.201
garbageman?

32:29.340 --> 32:31.342
Thank you so much.

32:37.720 --> 32:39.244
Hi.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.587
What can I get for you?

32:40.620 --> 32:42.588
Irene Reagan?

32:42.620 --> 32:45.225
I'm with Juvenile
Courts and Probation.

32:45.260 --> 32:46.488
What did I do?

32:46.530 --> 32:49.727
Oh, we're just following up on
your time in community service

32:49.760 --> 32:51.193
atthe
Guardian Family Planning Clinic.

32:51.230 --> 32:53.562
Well, that was over
two years ago.

32:53.600 --> 32:54.737
I thought my
probation ended.

32:54.770 --> 32:56.294
Yeah. Yeah, look,

32:56.340 --> 32:58.205
I'm sorry to bother you
about this at work.

32:58.240 --> 32:59.309
We tried you at your home,

32:59.340 --> 33:02.173
and I wasn't sure if you
had the same e-mail address.

33:02.210 --> 33:04.098
Still ReaganRules?

33:04.150 --> 33:06.175
Yes. Why? What do you want?

33:06.210 --> 33:10.374
I want to know why you made up
lies about Cheryl Willens.

33:13.150 --> 33:16.278
This is crazy, Peter. They need
to put you back in protected.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.083
Daniel's _
working on it.

33:18.130 --> 33:19.779
Childs moved you?

33:19.830 --> 33:21.388
Yeah.

33:21.430 --> 33:23.421
I think I know why.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.695
His wife, Carla Childs,

33:26.730 --> 33:29.233
I'm representing her.
She's divorcing him.

33:29.270 --> 33:30.464
I know.

33:30.500 --> 33:32.001
He was here.

33:33.110 --> 33:35.328
Childs was here?
He told you?

33:35.380 --> 33:37.029
Uh-huh.

33:37.080 --> 33:38.707
Then I need
to drop this.

33:38.750 --> 33:42.516
No. He'd have done
it either way.

33:42.550 --> 33:44.313
I'm the threat to him, not you.

33:44.350 --> 33:46.818
What is Triton Fields?

33:46.850 --> 33:49.353
What?

33:49.390 --> 33:51.620
Carla mentioned it.
She told me I should tell you.

33:54.330 --> 33:56.218
It's a development.

33:56.260 --> 34:00.720
The owner was charged with
bribing people in my office.

34:00.770 --> 34:04.069
Childs was the prosecutor.

34:04.110 --> 34:06.408
What else did she say?

34:06.440 --> 34:09.432
Just that he had a file
on his computer, that's all.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.308
You think she'd tell you
anything else?

34:35.600 --> 34:37.295
Counselor.

34:39.140 --> 34:40.300
Counselor?

34:43.810 --> 34:45.402
So, we holding grudges?

34:45.450 --> 34:47.441
Not that I know of.

34:47.480 --> 34:49.471
Because my tattoo
misses you.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.340
Let me think on it.

34:53.390 --> 34:54.789
Ouch.

34:54.820 --> 34:55.787
Nope.

34:55.820 --> 34:56.787
No ouch.

34:56.820 --> 34:58.356
I just want to think on it.

34:58.390 --> 35:00.858
Okay.

35:00.890 --> 35:03.154
Think fast.

35:06.470 --> 35:07.721
DIANE:
Would you consider yourself

35:07.770 --> 35:10.568
a fan of Duke Roscoe,
Ms. Reagan?

35:10.600 --> 35:12.409
Yes.

35:12.440 --> 35:13.702
DIANE:
Watch his show regularly?

35:13.740 --> 35:15.298
Been to his Web site?

35:15.340 --> 35:16.432
Sometimes.

35:16.480 --> 35:19.199
On Duke Roscoe's blog,

35:19.250 --> 35:22.469
there are 83 entries
from ReaganRules.

35:22.520 --> 35:23.373
Is that you?

35:23.420 --> 35:24.444
Uh-huh.

35:24.490 --> 35:25.582
And you would call

35:25.620 --> 35:28.589
83 entries "sometimes"?

35:28.620 --> 35:31.350
Did you also e-mail

35:31.390 --> 35:33.449
with Duke Roscoe?

35:33.490 --> 35:35.196
I tried a couple times.
Did you e-mail him

35:35.230 --> 35:38.825
information that Cheryl Willens
tried to obtain

35:38.870 --> 35:41.191
a late-term abortion at the
clinic where you worked?

35:42.840 --> 35:44.159
Ms. Reagan,

35:44.210 --> 35:45.837
do you know what perjury is?

35:51.610 --> 35:53.578
Yeah, I e-mailed him about it.

35:56.350 --> 35:57.442
Was it true?

35:57.480 --> 35:59.448
No.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.879
Did Duke Roscoe
contact you

36:01.920 --> 36:03.911
to verify your information?

36:03.960 --> 36:05.552
No.

36:05.590 --> 36:07.455
Anyone from his network
call you?

36:07.490 --> 36:09.219
No.

36:09.260 --> 36:10.227
And you were
surprised

36:10.260 --> 36:12.421
that Mr. Roscoe used

36:12.470 --> 36:16.190
your information on the air
to accuse Cheryl Willens.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.299
Why?

36:18.340 --> 36:21.400
I-I wrote him
to say I made it up.

36:21.440 --> 36:22.532
Come on!

36:22.580 --> 36:23.831
What am I, responsible for

36:23.880 --> 36:25.507
every e-mail sent to me?

36:25.550 --> 36:26.539
ABERNATHY:
Mr. Roscoe, please.

36:26.580 --> 36:27.604
Reclaim your seat.

36:27.650 --> 36:28.912
Why did you do it, Irene?

36:28.950 --> 36:31.544
Why would you

36:31.590 --> 36:33.546
make up something
so hurtful?

36:33.590 --> 36:36.559
I wanted to hear from him.

36:38.260 --> 36:39.454
To be part of it all.

36:39.490 --> 36:41.458
I mean, he's Duke Roscoe.

36:55.510 --> 36:57.728
"Dissolution of marriage."

36:57.780 --> 37:01.511
It sounds so final,
like a death certificate.

37:01.550 --> 37:03.438
Take your time, look it over.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.846
Your husband
already signed.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.983
You can change your mind.

37:08.020 --> 37:09.908
As we discussed, your
husband set aside

37:09.960 --> 37:12.588
your prenuptial agreement
and acceded to your terms.

37:12.630 --> 37:16.396
In exchange, he has included a
strict confidentiality clause.

37:16.430 --> 37:17.988
So anything I know
about his work...

37:18.030 --> 37:20.498
You are prohibited from
sharing with anyone.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.430
After I sign this.

37:22.470 --> 37:24.358
That's right.

37:29.710 --> 37:31.746
Then before I do,

37:31.780 --> 37:34.476
last year,
Glenn wiretapped your phones.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.943
What?

37:36.980 --> 37:38.982
I saw the recordings
on his computer.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.551
That's all I know.

37:48.730 --> 37:50.049
There.

37:50.100 --> 37:52.523
Done.

38:02.540 --> 38:04.440
Thanks, man.
I'm fine.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.948
(cell phone rings)

38:06.980 --> 38:09.949
Yeah?

38:09.980 --> 38:12.414
VVho?

38:12.450 --> 38:13.610
Okay.

38:16.720 --> 38:19.086
Never heard of that.

38:19.130 --> 38:22.622
Putting on no witnesses.

38:22.660 --> 38:24.321
Does that mean they give up?

38:24.370 --> 38:26.725
No, I'm afraid
they're counting on winning

38:26.770 --> 38:28.692
solely on Duke's
right of free speech.

38:33.070 --> 38:35.470
Could you give me a second?

38:37.880 --> 38:39.848
What?

38:41.880 --> 38:44.019
There was a response
to Duke's reward.

38:44.050 --> 38:45.540
What reward?

38:45.590 --> 38:47.342
For information on Jamie.

38:47.390 --> 38:48.516
That was the police
in Scranton.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.915
They think they have a child
matching Jamie's description.

38:50.960 --> 38:53.554
Oh, my God.

38:53.590 --> 38:54.989
WILL:
Was a childless couple

38:55.030 --> 38:57.521
who supposedly saw her
in a shopping cart

38:57.560 --> 38:58.561
and snatched her.

38:58.600 --> 39:03.367
One of their neighbors
phoned it in for the reward.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.903
I...

39:05.940 --> 39:08.932
(whispers):
Do you want to tell him?

39:08.980 --> 39:10.971
Yes.

39:18.750 --> 39:21.685
How you holding up?

39:21.720 --> 39:23.915
Okay.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.689
Listen, I just got a call

39:25.730 --> 39:29.120
from the Scranton
Police Department.

39:29.160 --> 39:31.663
You ready for some good news?

39:35.700 --> 39:36.928
They think they got
your girl, man.

39:36.970 --> 39:38.733
TIM (sobbing):
Is she okay?

39:38.770 --> 39:41.136
WILL:
I think so.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.706
It looks real good.

39:42.740 --> 39:44.799
(sobbing softly)

39:53.720 --> 39:55.711
Thank you.

40:09.940 --> 40:11.191
(sighs)

40:11.240 --> 40:12.264
I just received the verdict,

40:12.310 --> 40:15.507
and I find myself making
a very difficult decision.

40:15.540 --> 40:17.770
(quietly):
Uh-oh.

40:17.810 --> 40:21.610
While I hold the defendant's
behavior abhorrent

40:21.650 --> 40:24.744
and callous,
there is no greater bedrock

40:24.790 --> 40:26.678
to our society
than the First Amendment.

40:26.720 --> 40:30.781
Without it, all our other rights
are at risk.

40:30.820 --> 40:33.823
And I must admit, I have found

40:33.860 --> 40:35.919
the plaintiff's case
to the jury

40:35.960 --> 40:38.224
to play on their passions
in this matter,

40:38.260 --> 40:39.693
not their rationality.

40:39.730 --> 40:41.834
Uh... Mr. Roscoe receives

40:41.870 --> 40:43.895
thousands of e-mails
every day.

40:43.940 --> 40:45.601
_So it_is not
aXIomatically true

40:45.640 --> 40:48.677
that he would have seen
this e-mail from Ms. Reagan,

40:48.710 --> 40:49.677
invalidating her story.

40:49.710 --> 40:52.008
Without that certainty,

40:52.050 --> 40:55.770
I cannot allow a jury
under my purview

40:55.820 --> 40:57.173
to subvert the First Amendment.

40:57.220 --> 40:59.711
So I am, therefore,

40:59.750 --> 41:03.811
directing a verdict
in favor of the defense.

41:03.860 --> 41:05.623
(gallery murmuring)

41:09.100 --> 41:10.829
(gavelbangs)

41:10.860 --> 41:12.589
Tell Tim we'll appeal.

41:12.630 --> 41:15.098
Something tells me
he's not gonna want to.

41:19.140 --> 41:20.129
Maybe next time.

41:20.170 --> 41:22.707
I'd like that.

41:27.950 --> 41:30.771
MAN:
Neighbors credit publicity
from the recent trial

41:30.820 --> 41:32.617
as the reason_
for calling the police.

41:32.650 --> 41:34.914
Jamie Willens' picture had
appeared in local news reports

41:34.960 --> 41:37.178
over the last few weeks,

41:37.220 --> 41:38.721
and her image had been plastered
all over the Internet.

41:38.760 --> 41:40.057
This stuff's awful.

41:40.090 --> 41:41.159
It's too sweet.

41:41.190 --> 41:42.293
Mm-hmm.

41:42.330 --> 41:43.797
And yet, I can't
stop eating it.

41:43.830 --> 41:44.762
Pass me the remote.

41:44.800 --> 41:46.165
...quoted as saying
that he never doubted

41:46.200 --> 41:47.690
he would see
his little girl again.

41:47.730 --> 41:49.561
The family has asked...

41:49.600 --> 41:52.933
Before we move on
from this sordid episode,

41:52.970 --> 41:55.871
there is a bit of unfinished
business to deal with.

41:55.910 --> 41:57.207
He's gonna be
insufferable, isn't he?

41:57.240 --> 41:58.571
Yep.

41:58.610 --> 42:00.999
The promised secrets.

42:01.050 --> 42:04.747
Who spent two months
in a Michigan rehab?

42:04.790 --> 42:08.556
Stern, Lockhart equity partner
R.J. Daniels.

42:08.590 --> 42:09.784
Who was caught cheating

42:09.820 --> 42:12.823
on his 2007 income taxes?

42:12.860 --> 42:15.920
Jason Michaels in acquisitions.

42:15.960 --> 42:20.568
And last but not least,
who's the closeted

42:20.600 --> 42:23.034
lesbian working at the firm?

42:23.070 --> 42:24.196
That's none other than

42:24.240 --> 42:27.038
Diane Lockhart.

42:29.080 --> 42:32.072
