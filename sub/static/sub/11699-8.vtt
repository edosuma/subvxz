00:00.400 --> 00:03.351
Okay, Emma is officially...

00:03.352 --> 00:05.678
Renaissance faire ready.

00:05.679 --> 00:07.841
Now, remember, do not kiss

00:07.842 --> 00:09.719
the first prince you meet.

00:09.720 --> 00:11.833
You know, unless it's that new royal baby.

00:13.571 --> 00:15.889
Which in that case, lock that down.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.182
Ooh, preparest thee, fair Emma,

00:19.183 --> 00:21.660
for the grandest time of thee wee life.

00:22.791 --> 00:24.762
I'm not even sure Emma
should be going to this thing.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.392
Ren faire's just full of rowdy dudes

00:26.393 --> 00:28.437
on a quest to take home a drunken wench.

00:28.438 --> 00:29.505
Um, hello.

00:30.085 --> 00:31.919
In that case, lower the drawbridge.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.131
I'm going in.

00:36.887 --> 00:38.543
So, what do you think?

00:38.911 --> 00:40.606
Ren faire can't suck

00:40.607 --> 00:42.491
when you've got friar Tuck.

00:42.492 --> 00:43.887
Yeah.

00:44.197 --> 00:45.576
Emma doesn't have a choice,

00:45.577 --> 00:47.846
but why are you going to the dork ages?

00:48.394 --> 00:49.935
Dude, this is my job.

00:49.936 --> 00:52.063
I'm working on a piece
for "the Mary Hart show."

00:52.064 --> 00:55.697
"Ren faire: Nerds gone wild." (Chuckles)

00:55.698 --> 00:57.880
I'm a respected TV journalist.

00:57.881 --> 00:59.089
Aah.

01:01.315 --> 01:04.822
And Tucker Dobbs reporting
live from the floor.

01:05.609 --> 01:07.377
(Cellphone rings)

01:07.378 --> 01:08.566
It's him. It's your dad.

01:08.567 --> 01:09.602
Answer it. You know the drill.

01:09.603 --> 01:10.692
Right.

01:10.693 --> 01:12.077
The law office of Tucker Dobbs,

01:12.078 --> 01:13.441
how may I direct your call?

01:14.269 --> 01:15.794
Hello, Mr. Dobbs.

01:15.795 --> 01:17.750
Mr. Dobbs is just walking in. Here.

01:18.531 --> 01:20.259
Hey, dad. (Chuckles)

01:21.121 --> 01:22.188
No no no no.

01:22.189 --> 01:23.357
Just getting ready for court.

01:24.536 --> 01:26.139
What's up?

01:26.140 --> 01:28.709
The law office of Tucker Dobbs?

01:28.710 --> 01:30.854
Yeah, Tucker's dad thinks he's a lawyer.

01:30.855 --> 01:32.679
- Since when?
- Since he told him

01:32.680 --> 01:34.114
he graduated from law school.

01:35.099 --> 01:38.510
Okay, but Tucker dropped out of
law school like three years ago.

01:38.511 --> 01:39.843
I know that and you know that,

01:39.844 --> 01:41.561
but his dad doesn't know that.

01:41.562 --> 01:43.072
Why couldn't he just tell him the truth?

01:43.073 --> 01:44.506
Well, in his family, you're a doctor,

01:44.507 --> 01:45.946
you're a lawyer or you're an orphan.

01:47.129 --> 01:48.928
But all Tucker's ever
wanted to do is work in TV.

01:48.929 --> 01:50.293
So I might have suggested

01:50.294 --> 01:52.259
that he drop out and pursue his dream.

01:52.260 --> 01:53.555
Well, has anyone ever suggested

01:53.556 --> 01:55.325
that you stop suggesting things?

01:56.908 --> 01:57.993
All the time.

01:59.473 --> 02:01.380
But his parents never come into the city.

02:01.381 --> 02:03.235
Trust me, it is so not a big deal.

02:05.194 --> 02:06.546
My dad's in town.

02:09.023 --> 02:10.383
And now it's a big deal.

<i>Tucker: You know my dad will freak out,</i>

02:25.103 --> 02:26.598
but I can't keep this up.

02:26.599 --> 02:28.059
You know my knowledge of the law

02:28.060 --> 02:29.538
is limited to TV shows

02:29.539 --> 02:31.176
and that time we went to jury duty

02:31.177 --> 02:32.515
just to pick up girls.

02:33.283 --> 02:34.839
Look, I don't care who she killed.

02:34.840 --> 02:37.478
That defendant was guilty
of first degree sexiness.

02:40.043 --> 02:41.926
You may not know anything about the law,

02:41.927 --> 02:44.011
but we do know someone who does.

02:44.012 --> 02:47.115
Well, unfortunately the
deposed is indisposed

02:47.116 --> 02:50.497
and won't be re-disposed
until an undisclosed time.

02:50.498 --> 02:52.732
So in other words, I'm gonna be a while.

02:52.733 --> 02:53.859
- Oh!
- It's all right. I've got you.

02:54.289 --> 02:57.446
Yes. Yes, you do.

02:58.127 --> 02:59.503
No bones broken, I hope.

02:59.504 --> 03:00.417
Oh, no.

03:01.176 --> 03:02.332
- Riley, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

03:02.894 --> 03:04.070
I'm fine.

03:04.071 --> 03:06.040
Sorry, I'm so clumsy.

03:06.041 --> 03:08.383
Well, you look perfect
from where I'm standing.

03:08.724 --> 03:10.522
Yeah, whatever, man.

03:10.860 --> 03:12.324
Come on, we need your help.

03:14.476 --> 03:15.594
Who is that?

03:15.595 --> 03:16.650
Have you ever seen him before?

03:16.651 --> 03:17.911
What do you know about him?

03:17.912 --> 03:19.209
Riley, if I ever start

03:19.210 --> 03:20.755
noticing the guys who come in here,

03:20.756 --> 03:22.891
it's gonna become a very
different kind of bar.

03:24.868 --> 03:26.332
Okay, I'm gonna need you to tell me

03:26.333 --> 03:28.553
like a dozen lawyery things.

03:28.554 --> 03:30.306
- Ooh, can I borrow these?
- No no no no.

03:30.307 --> 03:31.610
Lawyer-client confidentiality.

03:31.611 --> 03:33.623
Ooh, that's a good one. Keep 'em coming.

03:34.684 --> 03:35.902
You're on your own.

03:35.903 --> 03:37.861
All right, I'm meeting Danny
to finalize our costumes.

03:37.862 --> 03:40.021
I'm kind of playing hooky
for the rest of the afternoon.

03:40.022 --> 03:41.840
Wait, so you're taking the afternoon off

03:41.841 --> 03:43.476
and you won't be back in your office?

03:43.477 --> 03:44.965
Well, not unless I run into my boss

03:44.966 --> 03:46.625
at the wench section at wig world.

03:47.627 --> 03:50.406
So you're not gonna be back
to the office today at all?

03:50.824 --> 03:52.043
<i>Riley: Okay, here's an idea.</i>

03:52.044 --> 03:54.213
All the energy that you use
to act like you're listening,

03:54.214 --> 03:55.956
try using it to actually listen.

03:57.807 --> 03:59.451
Hey, ren boy.

03:59.452 --> 04:00.770
You ready to get medieval?

04:01.454 --> 04:03.360
You have to help me. Mom
wants to come with us.

04:03.361 --> 04:04.929
So the more the merrier, right?

04:04.930 --> 04:06.295
No son ever needs to see

04:06.296 --> 04:07.956
his mother dressed up like a wench.

04:09.219 --> 04:10.769
Don't get me wrong. I'm all for boobs,

04:10.770 --> 04:12.688
just as long as they didn't
feed me at some point.

04:13.752 --> 04:15.097
(Cellphone vibrates)

04:15.098 --> 04:16.473
Oh, no, it's my coach.

04:16.474 --> 04:18.130
I told him I was at home sick in bed.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.694
(Coughs) Hey, coach.

04:20.695 --> 04:22.267
- Oh, hey, mom.
- Oh, hey, honey.

04:23.108 --> 04:24.603
Hey, Riley, I'm glad you're here.

04:24.604 --> 04:26.894
Okay, could you help me with my costume?

04:26.895 --> 04:29.301
You know, I need something
that features the girls,

04:29.302 --> 04:30.896
but is still street legal.

04:32.915 --> 04:36.112
Hey, breadstick, what's
up with the mooney face?

04:36.864 --> 04:39.015
I don't know. Have you ever just like

04:39.016 --> 04:40.181
looked into a guy's eyes

04:40.182 --> 04:41.594
and thought he could be the one?

04:41.595 --> 04:43.220
Yeah, this morning at the bank.

04:43.221 --> 04:44.478
Yesterday at the supermarket.

04:44.930 --> 04:46.788
And two weeks ago at the DMV.

04:47.803 --> 04:49.132
I'm not real choosy.

04:51.294 --> 04:52.827
<i>Wait.</i>

04:52.828 --> 04:54.636
Just now this happened?

04:55.397 --> 04:57.278
I know, I know. It's so silly.

04:57.279 --> 04:59.486
But something about the way he looked at me

04:59.487 --> 05:01.228
literally took my breath away.

05:01.229 --> 05:02.073
Really?

05:02.688 --> 05:05.288
Oh oh, my God. Okay, um...

05:05.289 --> 05:07.420
Well, you... you... you
need to say something.

05:07.799 --> 05:10.054
Oh my God, no. I could never.

05:10.055 --> 05:11.418
I mean, what if he doesn't like me back?

05:11.419 --> 05:12.756
Oh, he does.

05:14.199 --> 05:17.018
Yeah, I mean, you know, what's not to like?

06:47.412 --> 06:49.168
that you're truly passionate about the law,

06:49.820 --> 06:51.581
I'm gonna set you up

We are so winning the
costume contest this year.

07:58.244 --> 08:00.649
And wait till you see the skit
that Riley and I been working on.

08:00.650 --> 08:02.806
It's about the black
plague. It's hilarious!

08:03.946 --> 08:06.152
Yeah, okay, honey, but
have you maybe considered

08:06.153 --> 08:09.053
going in a slightly
more romantic direction?

08:09.054 --> 08:10.063
You know, with the skit

08:10.426 --> 08:12.173
and the costume.

08:13.319 --> 08:16.570
Why? This thing's a
guaranteed wench-magnet.

08:16.571 --> 08:17.760
The only thing that would be better

08:17.761 --> 08:19.320
is if I had a unicorn horn.

08:20.940 --> 08:23.101
Turns out those things
are impossible to find.

08:23.102 --> 08:25.158
Yeah yeah, sure. But, honey,

08:25.767 --> 08:27.922
Riley is going with you.

08:27.923 --> 08:30.594
- So?
- Okay, maybe you better sit down.

08:33.219 --> 08:34.763
Yeah, I guess standing is fine.

08:35.664 --> 08:37.303
Okay, remember when I told you

08:37.304 --> 08:39.363
that maybe you should let Riley go?

08:39.717 --> 08:41.783
Well, maybe...

08:41.784 --> 08:43.951
I put the cart before the horse.

08:45.533 --> 08:47.000
Mom, what are you saying?

08:47.001 --> 08:48.705
Oh, no no. I can't, I can't.

08:48.706 --> 08:50.403
Yes yes yes, you can.

08:50.404 --> 08:51.383
Okay.

08:52.116 --> 08:52.980
All right, Danny,

08:52.981 --> 08:55.132
I think that Riley might be into you.

08:55.133 --> 08:56.833
What?! Why do you think that?

08:56.834 --> 08:58.313
Well, she kind of told me.

08:58.314 --> 08:59.859
And now I'm kind of telling you.

08:59.860 --> 09:02.332
- I don't believe you.
- Well, then test the waters.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.522
You know, just put a
little something out there

09:04.523 --> 09:07.022
and see if she gives you
a little something back.

09:07.471 --> 09:09.284
- (Sighs)
- Yeah.

09:12.811 --> 09:13.964
I don't know.

09:13.965 --> 09:16.009
I've been putting out
there for like 15 years.

09:16.010 --> 09:19.635
Yeah, but, Danny, she called you "the one."

09:20.007 --> 09:21.370
The one what?

09:23.302 --> 09:25.572
Okay, I can lead you to water, Danny,

09:26.413 --> 09:28.358
but I can't make you think.

09:31.984 --> 09:34.201
Hey, there's my legal eagle.

09:34.930 --> 09:37.047
How did it go? Does your dad
still think you're a lawyer?

09:37.048 --> 09:38.347
Yep. (Laughs)

09:38.348 --> 09:39.857
Yep, he does.

09:39.858 --> 09:41.355
Dude, that's great.

09:41.356 --> 09:44.040
Yeah, in fact, we ran into his friend Bob.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.973
Yeah, he's also a lawyer.

09:45.974 --> 09:47.455
Owns a big firm.

09:48.071 --> 09:50.387
And I managed to convince him too.

09:51.105 --> 09:52.808
Tucker, man, you're amazing.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.180
Yeah, I know, I am.

09:54.535 --> 09:56.305
There's just one little problem.

09:56.847 --> 09:58.486
Bob offered me a job.

10:00.093 --> 10:01.667
I start on Monday.

10:04.556 --> 10:06.625
He offered you a job
and you actually accepted?!

10:06.626 --> 10:07.668
What's the matter with you?!

10:07.669 --> 10:08.887
I panicked.

10:09.827 --> 10:11.779
But I do get an office with a window.

10:12.578 --> 10:13.928
Good, you can jump out of it

10:13.929 --> 10:15.571
when they find out you're not a lawyer!

10:15.961 --> 10:17.166
Dude, you've got to help me.

10:17.167 --> 10:18.537
What am I gonna do now?

10:18.538 --> 10:21.315
Okay, Tucker, I'm gonna
suggest something drastic,

10:21.316 --> 10:23.872
something crazy, something
even I would never do.

10:25.150 --> 10:26.622
Tell him the truth.

10:28.596 --> 10:29.952
What else you got?

10:30.435 --> 10:32.588
Tucker, man, it's time you stopped lying.

10:32.589 --> 10:34.734
He's your dad. He'll understand.

10:35.147 --> 10:37.345
Face your fears. Follow your dreams.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.331
Let nothing stand in your way.

10:40.109 --> 10:42.087
That sounds a lot like
the speech you gave me

10:42.088 --> 10:44.480
when you talked me into
dropping out of law school.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.811
I thought that sounded familiar.

10:50.686 --> 10:53.049
<i>Danny: "Lovely maiden fair,</i>

10:53.050 --> 10:54.603
look into my...

10:55.636 --> 10:57.089
Heart?

10:57.488 --> 10:59.512
And tell me that you...

11:00.021 --> 11:01.536
Love me."

11:03.253 --> 11:06.053
Um, are you sure about this new skit?

11:06.054 --> 11:07.753
'Cause I kind of miss all the old jokes

11:07.754 --> 11:09.238
about death and sadness.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.102
But the romantic ones always win.

11:12.103 --> 11:13.903
So I thought that maybe
we could switch it up.

11:13.904 --> 11:15.580
- Just keep reading.
- Uh, fine.

11:15.581 --> 11:18.193
"And to you, kind sir,

11:18.194 --> 11:20.352
there is nothing to tell

11:20.353 --> 11:23.298
for my heart has always been true."

11:23.299 --> 11:26.501
"So upon these lips I place a kiss."

11:30.504 --> 11:31.824
Oh my God.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.214
<i>Danny: Oh my God?</i>

11:33.215 --> 11:34.986
"Oh my God" good? Or "oh my God" bad?

11:35.672 --> 11:38.196
So good. Um, amazing, great.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.080
Actually, can we do this again later?

11:40.081 --> 11:42.043
I got to... um, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

11:43.216 --> 11:46.435
Oh! Did you see that?

11:46.436 --> 11:47.461
Mom, you were right.

11:47.462 --> 11:48.867
She really does have feelings for me.

11:48.868 --> 11:51.309
Okay, did I tell you or did I tell you?

11:51.907 --> 11:53.596
You told me. And tomorrow,

11:53.597 --> 11:54.923
I'm gonna tell her.

11:55.271 --> 11:56.909
It's gonna be like a fairy tale.

11:58.354 --> 12:00.148
Yeah, the one where

12:00.149 --> 12:02.396
she rides off into the sunset...

12:03.591 --> 12:04.702
On you.

12:05.864 --> 12:07.823
Maybe we should rethink that costume.

12:08.475 --> 12:09.582
You know, before you give it back,

12:09.583 --> 12:11.364
can I borrow it just for like one weekend?

12:13.708 --> 12:14.773
<i>Tucker: I don't know if I can do this.</i>

12:14.774 --> 12:15.832
Hey, you'll be fine.

12:15.833 --> 12:17.928
Just look your dad in the eye
and tell him the truth.

12:18.445 --> 12:19.803
I'm here for you, man.

12:19.804 --> 12:21.490
<i>- (Knocking on door)
- Oh my God, it's him!</i>

12:22.959 --> 12:24.293
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

12:32.090 --> 12:33.619
There's my legal eagle.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.487
Ready head out and do some celebrating?

12:35.488 --> 12:37.096
Um, yeah, dad, before we go,

12:37.097 --> 12:38.249
we need to talk.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.902
- What's he doing here?
- He lives here.

12:39.903 --> 12:41.088
You live with your assistant?

12:41.089 --> 12:43.187
Yeah, it's part of what I
wanted to talk to you about.

12:44.205 --> 12:45.836
- You're gay?
- I'm not gay.

12:46.414 --> 12:48.249
- Does your girlfriend know?
- I don't have a girlfriend.

12:48.250 --> 12:49.463
Well, I guess we know why.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.814
<i>(Emma cries)</i>

12:51.815 --> 12:53.522
- And you have a baby?
- No, she's not my baby.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.033
She's actually my baby.

12:55.034 --> 12:57.908
Tucker, the least you could do
is adopt your gay lover's child.

12:57.909 --> 13:00.460
- Oh my...
- I thought we raised you right.

13:00.461 --> 13:02.906
No, dad, just... let me start all over.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.862
Okay, we are not gay.

13:04.863 --> 13:06.372
<i>Ben is my friend.</i>

13:07.155 --> 13:08.693
And most importantly...

13:09.957 --> 13:11.430
I'm not a lawyer.

13:11.431 --> 13:12.788
Oh, yes, you are.

13:14.795 --> 13:17.301
I dropped out of law
school after first semester.

13:17.302 --> 13:19.794
I work in TV. I'm trying
to become a producer.

13:19.795 --> 13:20.792
It's my dream.

13:20.793 --> 13:22.092
No, it's not.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.838
Yes. Yes, it is.

13:24.839 --> 13:27.805
I've told you that every time
you've asked me what I wanted to be.

13:27.806 --> 13:29.489
But you got that great scholarship.

13:29.490 --> 13:31.542
I might have lied about that too.

13:32.215 --> 13:34.393
But thanks for that
graduation trip to Mexico.

13:34.394 --> 13:35.794
<i>Fantastico.</i>

13:37.433 --> 13:39.404
So to obtain this so-called dream,

13:39.780 --> 13:41.542
- you decided to lie to me...
- Oh, no.

13:41.543 --> 13:42.834
And to your mother,

13:42.835 --> 13:45.370
to mock us and everything
we value and stand for?

13:45.371 --> 13:47.298
Dad, I'm so sorry.

13:47.299 --> 13:48.213
Oh, don't be.

13:48.529 --> 13:49.879
It's no longer a concern of mine

13:50.471 --> 13:51.627
because from now on,

13:52.324 --> 13:53.680
I no longer have a son.

13:55.686 --> 13:57.511
Wait, dad, let me explain.

14:00.939 --> 14:02.810
You should probably let Bob know

14:02.811 --> 14:04.244
you won't be in on Monday.

14:08.341 --> 14:09.556
- (Babbles)
- Okay.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.304
Listen, if this is lame,

14:11.649 --> 14:13.109
we need to have a signal.

14:13.110 --> 14:14.804
So flap your wings twice

14:14.805 --> 14:17.206
and we will skip out and get tacos.

14:17.889 --> 14:19.309
Yes yes, I know.

14:19.310 --> 14:20.554
Knock knock.

14:20.555 --> 14:23.892
One not-so-fair maiden
reporting for duty.

14:23.893 --> 14:25.682
Oh my gosh, what a coincidence.

14:25.683 --> 14:28.111
That's exactly what I wore to prom.

14:29.216 --> 14:30.473
Uh, where's Danny?

14:30.474 --> 14:32.410
Oh, he asked us to meet
him at the train station.

14:32.411 --> 14:34.602
He had a last minute costume change.

14:35.032 --> 14:38.118
So how's everything on the love front?

14:38.119 --> 14:39.537
You still all breathless?

14:39.538 --> 14:43.274
Yeah, but that may be the corset talking.

14:43.980 --> 14:46.762
So you haven't changed your mind, have you?

14:46.763 --> 14:49.071
No, I saw him yesterday.

14:49.072 --> 14:51.190
And it's all I've been thinking about.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.725
Oh, that's good.

14:53.301 --> 14:55.634
I just wish I at least
knew his name, you know?

14:55.635 --> 14:57.020
Oh, that's not good.

14:57.515 --> 14:59.788
I'm sorry, um, who are you talking about?

14:59.789 --> 15:01.949
The guy from the bar.

15:01.950 --> 15:03.507
Who are you talking about?

15:03.508 --> 15:05.412
The guy from the bar.

15:05.548 --> 15:08.597
I mean, who else would I be talking about?

15:08.598 --> 15:10.303
You know what, Riley? We've got a couple

15:10.304 --> 15:12.020
two, three things to do before we go.

15:12.021 --> 15:13.980
So why don't you just run on ahead

15:13.981 --> 15:15.470
and I will meet you there, okay?

15:15.471 --> 15:16.740
- All right, sounds good.
- All right.

15:16.741 --> 15:19.241
Well, I will see you in medieval times.

15:19.242 --> 15:21.134
- Fair thee...
- Oh my God.

15:21.135 --> 15:23.324
Fair thee... what the hell did I just do?

15:23.325 --> 15:24.408
Okay.

15:24.409 --> 15:25.488
All right.

15:25.489 --> 15:27.085
Okay, Danny, answer.

15:27.086 --> 15:28.257
Answer answer.

15:29.130 --> 15:30.950
- (Emma cries)
- Oh, don't judge me.

15:33.653 --> 15:35.461
<i>(Cellphone rings)</i>

15:36.588 --> 15:38.330
<i>(Ringing continues)</i>

15:40.461 --> 15:42.065
- Mr. Dobbs.
- I have nothing to say to you.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.560
Oh, no, please please.
Just give me two minutes.

15:43.561 --> 15:44.537
That's all I need.

15:44.987 --> 15:47.410
Look, I have no idea what you think of me.

15:47.411 --> 15:48.707
I think you're selfish and immature,

15:48.708 --> 15:50.702
and of indeterminate sexual orientation.

15:52.558 --> 15:53.677
Now we know.

15:54.653 --> 15:56.466
But there's one thing that
you and I have in common.

15:56.862 --> 15:58.358
We're both fathers.

15:58.359 --> 15:59.573
And dad to dad,

15:59.574 --> 16:01.678
I would never turn my
back on my little girl.

16:01.679 --> 16:03.798
Well, you check back with me
in 20 years when she's crushed

16:03.799 --> 16:05.596
all the hopes and dreams
you've had for her.

16:05.597 --> 16:07.800
That's just it! Those
are your hopes and dreams.

16:07.801 --> 16:08.820
Not Tucker's.

16:09.494 --> 16:11.379
Look, you're never around,
so you wouldn't know.

16:11.380 --> 16:13.124
But for the first time in his life,

16:13.125 --> 16:14.313
he's really happy.

16:14.717 --> 16:16.517
He loves working in TV.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.746
You mean poisoning the
minds of millions with crap

16:18.747 --> 16:20.060
repackaged as art?

16:20.061 --> 16:22.168
People seem to like it? I don't...

16:22.898 --> 16:24.949
Just come with me to see him work.

16:24.950 --> 16:26.978
And you'll see how competent
and capable he really is.

16:26.979 --> 16:28.669
And how passionate he is about his work.

16:30.116 --> 16:31.623
I'm thinking you're gonna be very impressed

16:31.624 --> 16:32.929
by what you see.

16:36.005 --> 16:37.252
(Bells ring)

16:39.281 --> 16:41.048
I thought the bells would cheer me up.

16:41.908 --> 16:43.155
They don't...

16:43.689 --> 16:45.440
(Ringing)

16:45.441 --> 16:46.829
Very much.

16:47.834 --> 16:49.093
Danny?

16:49.094 --> 16:51.821
Or should I say, sir Danny?

16:52.319 --> 16:54.185
At your service, milady.

16:55.033 --> 16:56.560
You look amazing.

16:56.907 --> 16:58.046
And you look...

16:59.129 --> 17:00.492
you look amazing.

17:01.667 --> 17:03.456
Like my knight in shining armor.

17:03.936 --> 17:05.289
That was kind of the point.

17:05.667 --> 17:07.624
Riley, I was gonna wait until the ren faire

17:07.625 --> 17:09.105
to tell you this, but that
would just be more time

17:09.106 --> 17:11.286
- without knowing exactly how...
- (Bonnie grunts)

17:12.316 --> 17:13.742
(Pants)

17:13.743 --> 17:15.005
Oh, whew!

17:15.365 --> 17:18.079
Okay, somebody should
check Emma's teeth for bugs

17:18.079 --> 17:21.272
because we just set some
sort of stroller speed record.

17:21.273 --> 17:22.893
Uh, mom, we're in the middle of something.

17:22.894 --> 17:24.194
Yeah, and if you get to the end of it,

17:24.195 --> 17:25.823
it's going to be the end of me.

17:25.824 --> 17:28.710
Danny, me thinks thou
should shutteth uppeth.

17:29.344 --> 17:31.643
Not now. Riley, you need to hear this.

17:31.644 --> 17:33.862
Ow ow, easy there, robo-knight.

17:33.863 --> 17:36.019
Excuse me, is this knight bothering you?

17:36.020 --> 17:37.771
- She's fine.
- I wasn't talking to you.

17:37.772 --> 17:38.956
- I'm fine.
- You heard her.

17:38.957 --> 17:40.527
Again, not talking to you.

17:40.528 --> 17:41.911
Fine because I think we're done talking.

17:41.912 --> 17:43.476
Is that how we're playing it?

17:43.477 --> 17:44.811
It most certainly is.

17:46.625 --> 17:47.643
No no no.

17:48.294 --> 17:49.365
Oh, Danny!

17:50.102 --> 17:51.584
- Bonnie: Danny, no, Danny.
- Riley: Stop. Stop it.

17:51.585 --> 17:52.827
Stop, okay. (Screams)

17:52.828 --> 17:54.067
<i>Bonnie: Okay, all right. Here we go.</i>

17:54.068 --> 17:55.335
Here we go, all right.

17:55.336 --> 17:56.263
Danny, stop.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.248
<i>- (Riley screams)
- Bonnie: Danny!</i>

17:58.249 --> 17:59.394
- Oh my God.
- Oh no.

<i>Danny, no no no.</i>

18:02.489 --> 18:03.470
<i>Bonnie:  Stop it.</i>

18:03.471 --> 18:04.774
I got your back, Danny!

Eat bells, tin man!

18:08.887 --> 18:10.514

- (Screaming)

18:15.084 --> 18:16.215
Dad?

18:17.771 --> 18:19.664
Well, I know I'm impressed.

18:19.665 --> 18:21.133
How about you?

18:21.734 --> 18:23.249
Oh my God, Danny. Are you okay?

18:24.032 --> 18:25.544
You are such a jerk.

18:28.604 --> 18:30.451
Oh my God, are you okay?

18:30.774 --> 18:32.295
You are such a jerk.

18:33.796 --> 18:35.096
I was afraid I'd never see you again.

18:35.963 --> 18:37.172
I'm Philip.

18:37.173 --> 18:38.599
I'm Riley.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.853
What are the chances we'd
both be going to ren faire?

18:41.599 --> 18:43.058
Unless you're an actual knight.

18:43.419 --> 18:44.811
That's cool too.

18:46.190 --> 18:47.707
This is him.

18:48.011 --> 18:51.722
Oh, so that's the one.

18:51.723 --> 18:55.775
Yeah, it turns out he's the one.

18:55.776 --> 18:57.638
Yeah, I got that part.

18:58.246 --> 19:00.369
Um, look, Danny, I am so...

19:00.991 --> 19:03.899
why do people even listen to me?

19:03.900 --> 19:06.094
(Laughs) Damsel in distress!

19:06.095 --> 19:07.519
Coming through!

19:10.509 --> 19:12.004
Dad, what are you doing here?

19:12.005 --> 19:14.113
I just brought him by to see you at work.

19:14.856 --> 19:16.383
And I've seen enough.

19:16.384 --> 19:17.443
Oh, hell no.

19:17.444 --> 19:19.891
You don't get to walk away from me twice.

19:20.722 --> 19:22.501
Do you know what being a dad means?

19:23.301 --> 19:25.358
Unconditional love and support.

19:25.359 --> 19:26.746
And you know who taught me that?

19:26.747 --> 19:28.191
Ben.

19:28.192 --> 19:29.620
Oh, thanks, man.

19:30.387 --> 19:32.058
You might want to take your
hat off, I'm just saying.

19:34.771 --> 19:36.368
But it should have been you.

19:37.165 --> 19:39.351
So you can pretend you don't have a son,

19:39.352 --> 19:41.016
disown me, whatever. I don't care.

19:41.017 --> 19:42.894
I'm done lying about what I do.

19:42.895 --> 19:45.286
I'm following my dream and I'm happy.

19:47.345 --> 19:48.828
This is who I am.

19:51.582 --> 19:53.270
Now you can go.

19:54.307 --> 19:55.653
That was a great speech.

19:57.775 --> 20:00.129
Reminds me of the one
I wish I'd given my dad.

20:01.914 --> 20:03.301
What are you saying?

20:03.747 --> 20:05.299
What I'm saying is

20:06.666 --> 20:08.179
I made a mistake.

20:09.546 --> 20:10.929
And I'm sorry...

20:11.308 --> 20:13.042
That I've been so closed-minded.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.112
But what I'm really saying is

20:16.883 --> 20:18.554
is that I'm very proud

20:19.392 --> 20:21.907
to call you my son.

20:33.880 --> 20:36.015
That was a great speech, Tucker.

20:36.501 --> 20:38.411
Maybe you should have been a lawyer.

20:38.412 --> 20:39.969
(Mouths)

20:43.288 --> 20:44.291
<i>Bonnie: Are you okay?</i>

20:44.637 --> 20:45.808
I'm fine.

20:46.919 --> 20:49.747
Except I lost the instructions
on how to get out of this suit.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.078
I'm really sorry about Riley.

20:53.633 --> 20:54.873
Don't be.

20:54.874 --> 20:56.170
It's all good.

20:56.171 --> 20:58.506
Riley might think she found
her knight in shining armor,

20:58.507 --> 20:59.987
but I know how this story ends.

20:59.988 --> 21:01.226
With me.

21:02.022 --> 21:03.313
I'm her prince charming.

21:05.344 --> 21:08.579
Then, to your happily ever after.

21:09.305 --> 21:15.320
