WEBVTT

00:00.040 --> 00:01.585
Previously on Condor ...

00:01.710 --> 00:04.397
I'm under suspicion. Tell Partridge
that I need an out.

00:04.523 --> 00:06.733
Why are you following me?
-I work for your Uncle Bob.

00:06.859 --> 00:08.428
Bob Partridge and I don't talk.

00:08.554 --> 00:10.818
Joe, It's Reuel Abbott.
-Why the fuck do you have Bob's phone?

00:10.943 --> 00:13.153
Your uncle appears to
have taken his own life

00:13.279 --> 00:14.904
I need to know why
Bob was trying to call you.

00:14.916 --> 00:15.857
I was approached by them.

00:15.983 --> 00:19.106
No, not like that. We're no on a secure
channel, I'm gonna  give you an address.

00:19.232 --> 00:22.512
Gordon throws a party tomorrow.
Maybe we can go together.

00:22.638 --> 00:26.262
There he is.. a big story,
worse day at work

00:26.432 --> 00:29.324
The Ukrainian op I was telling you about.
Went sideways

00:29.450 --> 00:32.106
The Russians were waiting,
it was a fucking bloodbath.

00:33.020 --> 00:37.238
Vasili Sirin, a colonel in the SVR, he's a
double, Bob was running him; he's blown.

00:37.364 --> 00:38.684
His own people are trying to kill him.

00:38.809 --> 00:41.185
He says, he can identify
a mole within the CIA.

00:41.209 --> 00:44.519
American assets were ambushed
and killed in Ukraine yesterday.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.465
Vasili Sirin is maybe our best lead,
I need him here, in America, save.

00:47.477 --> 00:49.915
I'm making a introduction,
which I'm done,now I'm leaving ..

00:50.134 --> 00:52.362
Without your help, Vasili Sirin is dead.

00:52.605 --> 00:55.995
Bob is dead. I spoke with the deputy
director, our flight leaves in five hours.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.748
We should have a plan
to meet up in the other side

00:58.760 --> 01:01.451
in case we get separated,
Union Station, track 11.

01:02.721 --> 01:06.228
They came for him in an ambulance.
-Why did they let you go?

01:06.354 --> 01:09.649
I do not know.
-I made a mistake asking you to do this.

01:09.775 --> 01:15.292
Bob didn't kill himself,
you understand? Joe, he was murdered.

01:51.509 --> 01:55.095
Subtitles: Nonplus
Retranslate: Visone

02:00.150 --> 02:03.120
Just relax, we're here to help you.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.050
Everything alright back there?

02:54.500 --> 02:56.420
Don't move.

03:45.040 --> 03:49.015
Was it your fault?

03:49.140 --> 03:52.110
What was my fault?
-The car accident.

03:57.787 --> 04:02.095
I don't know ... No.
I didn't see them coming.

04:02.220 --> 04:05.020
Then it was probably your fault.

04:08.842 --> 04:11.200
Are you okay?

04:13.030 --> 04:18.180
I do not know.
It doesn't feel right... been back.

04:21.019 --> 04:23.631
You can tell me
whatever is you thinking, Joe.

04:24.925 --> 04:27.634
I think Bob's death is more
complicated than it's looks.

04:27.646 --> 04:29.174
More complicated than suicide?

04:29.300 --> 04:32.940
Nothing is what it seems to be, trust me.
You know that.

04:34.198 --> 04:36.198
Do you think...?
-Bob called me in Hungary.

04:38.020 --> 04:40.479
What did he say?
-I was to mad and I missed the call.

04:40.605 --> 04:44.140
It's no great mystery there, Joe.
That is called guilt.

04:45.488 --> 04:48.856
That doesn't mean that
he was murdered. Unless

04:48.868 --> 04:51.816
there's anything
else you don't tell me?

04:53.010 --> 04:56.887
You looking for a clean answer.
I know what that's like.

04:59.840 --> 05:03.301
Would you rather think Sam died as a hero
or know the truth?

05:03.848 --> 05:07.801
Sam did something unthinkable
and nobody want to say anything about it.

05:08.503 --> 05:15.283
Sammy and I know the truth, some version
of it, and neither of us are very happy,

05:15.418 --> 05:18.241
So, if I have the choice,
I would like to choose

05:18.253 --> 05:21.262
to believe that Sam died
defending for his country.

05:23.030 --> 05:26.631
If it's any consolation,
That is what he thought he was doing.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.010
It's not.

05:33.626 --> 05:37.526
I can't remember when was the last I had an
honest conversation like this with anyone.

05:44.311 --> 05:50.090
Lying is wrong unless it is
a higher purpose serves: Aldrich Ames

05:50.216 --> 05:54.021
IF IT SERVES A GREATER GOOD

06:02.920 --> 06:08.185
Are you going to Partridge's funeral?
Is different among the adults?

06:08.498 --> 06:10.209
My father knew him.

06:12.271 --> 06:15.874
How your dad feel about his old pal
getting a heart attack pill?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.874
Partridge shot himself.
Committed suicide.

06:20.217 --> 06:23.825
You believe that?
Because you read it in the newspaper?

06:23.951 --> 06:25.513
More than one.

06:26.050 --> 06:31.045
Fish don't see the water, my friend. I know
you think I’m a "conspiracy mad," but I ...

06:31.171 --> 06:33.171
Wash your hands, bro!.

06:37.073 --> 06:40.415
I'm not making it this shit up.
Ask your pal here.

06:40.589 --> 06:43.503
He knows what our government is capable of.
Don't you, Barber?

06:43.628 --> 06:45.861
He read the Frost dossier.

06:45.987 --> 06:49.377
That shit was a hoax. Do you ever read the
Hornbill's Commission report ?

06:49.503 --> 06:52.408
The Hornbill Commission
was a deep state cover up. Fact.

06:52.760 --> 06:57.063
Our own government tried to unleash a
plague against the Muslim world. Also fact

06:57.189 --> 06:59.680
look, if you want a believe
in consoling national

06:59.692 --> 07:01.794
myth like the Hornbill
Commission and ...

07:03.129 --> 07:05.667
social mobility ...
fine .... then we should

07:05.679 --> 07:08.285
all accept that Bob
Partridge killed himself.

07:08.411 --> 07:10.301
Please, can't we just buy......?

07:10.824 --> 07:14.809
He is 23 old man and still lives
in his parents' basement.

07:16.551 --> 07:20.395
That doesn't mean he isn't right.
-Come on man

07:20.521 --> 07:25.904
I did read the Frost dossier.
My last name is in the Frost dossier.

07:26.030 --> 07:29.591
Do you seriously think your dad
was involved with that shit

07:29.950 --> 07:35.294
Yes.I do, why is it so hard for you to
believe? There are bad people in the world.

07:35.442 --> 07:38.482
Sometimes one just
happens to be your father ..

07:39.893 --> 07:42.813
You know maybe my dad
got what he had coming.

07:43.789 --> 07:47.639
What pisses me of is that
no one else did.

07:48.651 --> 07:50.301
Like who?

08:09.611 --> 08:12.025
Thanks for meeting on a
Saturday, I know we all have

08:12.037 --> 08:14.555
a lot going on, especially
with the funeral today, so.

08:14.681 --> 08:17.201
I'm not going to the funeral.
-Really?

08:17.213 --> 08:20.329
I don't socialized with
people I investigate.

08:20.455 --> 08:23.587
I guess personal experience
told you how difficult

08:23.599 --> 08:26.743
it is to see those closest
to us, with clear eyes.

08:27.010 --> 08:29.759
Did you just come here to insult me?
-Did you read my report?

08:29.885 --> 08:33.866
About your hard-liner defection and
the mysterious Russian op's team

08:33.993 --> 08:38.975
who took away your defector by an ambulance
it's creeping stuff, should be fiction.

08:39.101 --> 08:40.943
Just the only difference
between fiction and

08:40.955 --> 08:42.892
reality is the limited
imagination of writers.

08:43.020 --> 08:45.425
You have quite the imagination yourself.

08:45.551 --> 08:50.254
Using Joe Turner of all people. It's no
wonder that the Russians outplayed you.

08:51.504 --> 08:54.471
I used think you're
acting out of malice, but ...

08:54.597 --> 08:58.784
this is  much more human and
ordinarily type of incompetence.

08:59.362 --> 09:03.925
And I couldn't helped but noticed that you
you didn't filed you report

09:04.050 --> 09:07.065
until only after your operation failed.

09:07.190 --> 09:11.220
I didn't know who I can trust and turns
out I had a good reason to be concerned.

09:11.346 --> 09:13.786
And it didn't occurred to
you that my department's

09:13.798 --> 09:16.298
entire mission is to handle
cases exactly like this

09:16.424 --> 09:19.925
Under the circumstances ...
-What circumstances?

09:20.050 --> 09:23.994
That I've been dong everything in my power
for the last two years to bring you down?

09:24.119 --> 09:26.658
Yes, those circumstances.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.026
Why are you in my office?

09:29.151 --> 09:31.036
Because there is a mole
in the building and you

09:31.060 --> 09:32.944
are among other things,
our resident mole hunter.

09:33.070 --> 09:35.564
And you're suggesting,
what? that we team up?

09:35.690 --> 09:38.398
I'm suggesting that the mole
treachery is getting people

09:38.410 --> 09:41.463
killed and causing other damages
in ways we can't begin to know

09:41.589 --> 09:46.432
So, as much as we dislike each other ...
-I don't have a personal opinion about you.

09:46.635 --> 09:52.904
Okay. As much as I dislike you personally,
I showed you my report ...

09:53.221 --> 09:55.213
in the spirit of openness.

09:55.339 --> 09:59.666
And now you want me to share
what I know with you ...

10:00.030 --> 10:03.642
... about the mole that you tried
to keep a secret from me?

10:05.030 --> 10:07.740
Thanks for the report, Reuel and
your insults.

10:07.865 --> 10:11.459
I'll let you know when my department
has anything to report back to you

10:14.450 --> 10:18.520
Unless there's anything else?
-No, not at the moment.

10:22.020 --> 10:25.629
I can sleep on the couch.
-No, Sammy is happy to give you his room.

10:26.010 --> 10:28.100
He takes Sam's old office.

10:29.754 --> 10:32.674
Jude is over the
neighbors, I've to go get him.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.410
You need anything?
-No, I think I'm good.

10:36.840 --> 10:41.191
How about an iron? Your suit must
be all wrinkled up in there.

10:41.332 --> 10:44.412
Oh, shit!
-Are you serious, that you've forgot your suit?

10:44.424 --> 10:46.130
I act with a little bit rush.

10:47.070 --> 10:51.605
You know, I'll get you something.
-I could've sworn that I ...

11:19.130 --> 11:21.040
Come here.

11:25.566 --> 11:28.722
Here. Put this on, see how it fits.

11:28.972 --> 11:31.190
Thank you.
-I'm go get Jude.

11:38.574 --> 11:40.789
Sorry, I forgot you
were in my room.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.629
Sammy. I wouldn't
recognize you, you got big.

11:43.793 --> 11:48.985
yeah, I went to puberty couple years ago.
Is that one of my dad suits?

11:49.110 --> 11:53.187
Yes, I didn't packed one.
I forgot the man was a giant.

11:53.313 --> 11:56.150
I just get my stuff and get out of here.

11:58.323 --> 12:01.040
Just hang out. I haven't
see you in a long time.

12:01.052 --> 12:02.055
I have homework.

12:02.602 --> 12:04.662
You ok?
-I'm great.

12:05.030 --> 12:07.314
Sam, are you upset with me?
-No.

12:07.440 --> 12:09.986
I was upset to you two
years ago, when you fucking

12:09.998 --> 12:12.807
ghosted me right after
father’s died, but I'm fine now.

12:13.659 --> 12:17.604
Would you think I would just come
running into your arms? Uncle Joe.

12:17.738 --> 12:20.767
No, I ... Sammy?

12:22.254 --> 12:25.851
Uncle Joe.
-How you doing, buddy?

12:28.130 --> 12:31.250
No, no one tailor is
gonna make that suit fit.

12:31.375 --> 12:34.797
Are you alright?
I hear you were in an accident.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.906
I'm ok, thank you pal.

12:38.031 --> 12:40.304
You know, I'll call Lily and
ask to borrow one of Bob's suit.

12:40.430 --> 12:43.449
One of my uncle's suit
for my uncle funeral?

12:43.461 --> 12:45.414
believe me, she won't mind.

13:06.182 --> 13:08.347
Hi. It's a bad time?

13:08.472 --> 13:13.722
No, it's a perfect. I was
just about to burst into tears.

13:15.489 --> 13:20.060
Sorry to ask this,
but I didn't bring a suit.

13:22.637 --> 13:26.291
Oh Joe, You can come to he house
and borrow one of Bob's.

13:26.417 --> 13:28.537
Are you sure?
-Of course.

13:29.030 --> 13:32.354
I wouldn't be here, I have
to go to get my hair done.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.355
The key is under the flower pot.
I'll see you later.- Ok

15:37.050 --> 15:39.000
Aunt Lily?

15:48.030 --> 15:49.635
Aunt Lily?

17:29.070 --> 17:31.120
Who the fuck are you?

18:38.302 --> 18:40.501
The man was a lion.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
We were in Libya in '86.

18:48.160 --> 18:52.712
it’s Bob's nephew.
-Has he had any problems?

18:52.838 --> 18:54.948
He was completely innocent.

19:02.611 --> 19:07.305
Why wouldn't show yourself at the funeral?
-I was in Bob's office.

19:07.431 --> 19:10.904
You've been here all this time?
-I got hit on the head.

19:11.030 --> 19:14.110
Robert, can you get Mae Barber?
What do you mean?

19:14.236 --> 19:18.418
There was someone in Bob's
office. You're not safe here.

19:18.430 --> 19:19.975
Am I not safe here?

19:20.998 --> 19:23.264
Where were you?We're
calling you, we thought

19:23.276 --> 19:25.403
you have another
accident. What happened?

19:25.529 --> 19:29.451
He fainted and hit his head.
-Shit,look at me.

19:31.115 --> 19:35.161
How many fingers am I holding up?
-Two,really I'm fine, I just need a second

19:35.287 --> 19:37.849
You need some water.
-I'll bring some water.

19:38.881 --> 19:42.809
Now we don't have uber home.
-Hey, not so rude.

19:42.935 --> 19:44.772
Oh, shit, I left the car ...

19:44.784 --> 19:48.614
No,doesn't matter, I don’t
care, just glad you're okay.

19:48.740 --> 19:51.240
You're okay, right?
-Yes, only ...

19:51.646 --> 19:57.356
You must be Joe. Tracy Crane.
Everyone was looking for you.

19:57.482 --> 19:59.365
He hit his head.

19:59.545 --> 20:03.677
Are you alright?
-Yes, I just need a second ... Thank you ..

20:03.810 --> 20:06.035
I'm gonna get you an ice pack.

20:06.160 --> 20:10.044
Don't you want to sit down?
-No, then I collapse.

20:10.170 --> 20:12.115
You must be Anders's dad.

20:12.982 --> 20:15.630
You've been talking about me,uh?
-No.

20:15.756 --> 20:19.670
Holy shit, this is
'82 Mouton Rothschild

20:20.841 --> 20:24.574
Joe? Joe...?

20:24.700 --> 20:26.746
I recognize you, I know that guy.

20:28.121 --> 20:30.355
Gordon Piper - Joe Turner.

20:30.481 --> 20:32.819
That handsome face
was all over the newspaper

20:32.831 --> 20:35.130
a few years ago. Glad
all worked out for you

20:36.246 --> 20:39.965
My better half Eva.
-Hi, so nice to meet you.

20:40.090 --> 20:43.402
I'm so sorry about your uncle.- Thank you
-Yeah, me too,he was a good man.

20:44.014 --> 20:46.184
Who tune you up?
- Be nice, Gordon.

20:46.310 --> 20:49.926
He hit his head.
Made him another concussion.

20:50.230 --> 20:53.394
You gotta be more careful.
Do you want a drink?

20:54.010 --> 20:57.362
Yeah, because it's what he need to go over a concussion -I
meant like a juice or something, I'm just trying to be helpful.

20:57.374 --> 20:58.495
Sure, you are!

20:59.355 --> 21:02.894
Have you seen that Mouton Rothschild?
It's like  1,800 a bottle.

21:03.020 --> 21:06.768
Why are you so gross?
- Am I embarrassing the Duchess?

21:06.894 --> 21:09.761
Don't call me that.
-Then don't act like Duchess so I wont.

21:09.886 --> 21:10.900
There you go.

21:11.026 --> 21:13.855
You ransacked the
wine cellar, right?

21:13.867 --> 21:17.306
Bob bought that case
on auction 20 years ago

21:17.432 --> 21:20.701
We were waiting for
the right occasion to drink

21:20.713 --> 21:23.721
it but that occasion
never came, Excuse me.

21:27.010 --> 21:30.477
I'm gonna go to drink that wine
To honor Bob's.

21:30.705 --> 21:35.588
That's the right thing to do.
-It's the Absolutely right thing to do.
Come on, babe.

21:41.564 --> 21:46.085
Who was that guy?
-Gordon. Do you know him?

21:46.874 --> 21:49.884
He seems familiar.
How did he know Bob?

21:50.010 --> 21:51.908
he's a friend from the office.

21:52.033 --> 21:54.939
You're a little bit pale.
I think you should sit down.

21:55.070 --> 22:00.673
My condolences, by the way. Your uncle
was the last of its kind.

22:01.181 --> 22:04.935
Thank you. I'm going...
Excuse me.

22:05.814 --> 22:07.368
Wait. Are you okay?

22:07.380 --> 22:11.170
Yes, I just need to
use the bathroom, sorry

22:22.048 --> 22:24.274
Blow it away from me, dude.

22:25.181 --> 22:27.696
Give me that.
-How do I look?

22:28.779 --> 22:32.789
Really stoned.
Everybody are gonna know.

22:34.662 --> 22:36.642
How about me?

22:38.010 --> 22:40.404
Do you have those wipes?

22:54.388 --> 22:58.955
I was looking around Bob's office before
the funeral and someone attacked me.

22:59.185 --> 23:02.287
This isn't the time or place.

23:02.677 --> 23:04.234
Was that one of your people?

23:04.258 --> 23:07.945
Cause I'm getting pretty sick and tired
of being everyone's punching bag.

23:08.071 --> 23:10.896
Then you should stop put in
your face were it doesn't belong.

23:14.287 --> 23:17.467
Did you see anything in
there, in your uncle's office?

23:19.404 --> 23:20.492
No.

23:20.504 --> 23:23.802
Good. Now you can go
back to being a civilian.

23:42.599 --> 23:47.030
Where were you?
-Just, around, grieving.

23:48.010 --> 23:53.090
Did you seen Jude outside?
-No. He's probably praying.

23:54.674 --> 23:56.210
Oh my God...

24:28.236 --> 24:34.134
This wine needs something disgusting
as a contrast. My cigarettes are upstairs.

25:01.110 --> 25:03.120
A little spy.

25:12.654 --> 25:14.684
Look who's there.

25:30.010 --> 25:31.200
See you later.

25:41.847 --> 25:44.074
Can I have one?
-Yes.

25:44.324 --> 25:46.074
Thank you

25:50.963 --> 25:53.207
I left my lighter... - Ehhh!

25:54.917 --> 25:56.652
Gets a lucky break anyhow and again.

25:56.792 --> 26:01.025
Do you know? Smoking saved my life.
-Eh, yeah?

26:01.548 --> 26:03.458
Yes really.

26:15.792 --> 26:18.965
I wouldn't exactly say he's the
easiest going person in the world

26:19.090 --> 26:22.240
but he was a real one
genius, I know that because ...

26:32.894 --> 26:37.065
Excuse me, do you remember me?
- Of course I remember you , Jude.

26:37.191 --> 26:38.940
Were you friends with my dad?

26:38.952 --> 26:42.292
Yes, I'm Reuel Abbot
and I really liked your father.

26:42.496 --> 26:44.985
Do you remember you and me
watched a movie together once?

26:45.110 --> 26:49.430
It's "you and I," Jude,
and no, I don't recall.

26:55.120 --> 26:57.120
Sammy, stop it!

26:58.080 --> 26:59.915
Everything  alright, buster?

27:00.040 --> 27:05.008
What are you doing? Sammy.
Sammy, walk away, Now!

27:05.134 --> 27:08.367
Don't give It another thought, Mae.
- Stay the fuck away from my kids.

27:14.555 --> 27:17.011
What the hell was that? Sammy?

27:17.023 --> 27:21.053
He shouldn't be here,
he's a fucking criminal.

27:21.179 --> 27:24.726
He was one of dad's friend.
-Maybe Dad was a fucking criminal.

27:26.060 --> 27:32.080
Jesus, fucking shit!!...
You just stay here. I mean it.

27:37.090 --> 27:40.020
You've my car keys.
-Yes, are you leaving?

27:40.145 --> 27:42.888
Sammy just gone protocol
rogue with Reuel Abbott's shoes.

27:43.285 --> 27:45.925
It's not funny, Gordon.
- No Obviously no, sorry
- Do you need me to come?

27:46.198 --> 27:48.535
No, you should be here for you aunt.
-I'll give him a lift.

27:48.676 --> 27:52.080
Are you sure?
-Yes, I'll see you soon.

27:54.010 --> 27:56.220
I'll take you on that lift.
- Yeah

27:58.268 --> 28:03.925
I'm really I'm sorry about your uncle.
I liked him a lot.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.214
You and he were friends?

28:05.339 --> 28:08.901
-We had lunch a few weeks back.
He seemed...

28:09.234 --> 28:14.294
... fine, normal, but ... I
get that doesn't mean shit.

28:17.557 --> 28:19.502
People wear masks, you know.

28:19.628 --> 28:25.065
Some people wear'em all the time.
Maybe everyone does.

28:25.807 --> 28:30.035
So how long you back for?
-I dont know. I just got back.

28:30.573 --> 28:34.623
Things are moving pretty quickly, so.
-Yeah, life does that.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
Can I play in the yard?
-Yes, fine.

28:54.010 --> 28:55.339
Sammy?

28:55.834 --> 28:57.744
Sammy.

28:58.908 --> 29:02.533
Do you want to talk about it?
-Not really.

29:02.659 --> 29:04.105
I want to talk about it.

29:04.759 --> 29:07.896
Doesn't bother you to be
in the same room as him?

29:07.908 --> 29:10.617
Yes. But I just
pretended he's not there.

29:10.743 --> 29:15.915
Well, my dad's dead because of him,
so I can't do that -We don't know that.

29:16.040 --> 29:19.463
We don't know what he did
or what dad did or any of it.

29:19.475 --> 29:21.438
Would you tell me if you knew?

29:23.532 --> 29:27.100
Probably not.
-Why?

29:28.267 --> 29:32.237
Because I don't want your childhood to get
even more fucked up than it's already been.

29:34.514 --> 29:37.384
Dad's not gonna get any more dead.

29:41.030 --> 29:43.100
That's a fair point.

30:27.200 --> 30:30.344
Excuse us. Come on.
-Sorry.

30:30.470 --> 30:34.852
Let's get out of here. I'm horny.
-It's a funeral.

30:34.978 --> 30:37.915
Funerals make people horny, I'm not making
this shit up, come on, let's go home.

30:38.040 --> 30:41.618
The kids are in home.
-Then we'll do it in the car.

30:42.704 --> 30:44.754
I drive myself.

30:49.493 --> 30:51.876
You smell like cigarettes.
-There's a good reason for that.

30:52.001 --> 30:54.001
Why don't I drive.
-No, I'm driving.

30:54.165 --> 30:56.782
Give me money for Amber.
-I never got to the ATM.

30:56.907 --> 30:59.695
Really? It's the one thing I asked
you to do, -We'll write a check.

30:59.821 --> 31:02.161
Do you thing the babysitter
have a checking account, she's 15.

31:02.173 --> 31:04.899
Then we'll stop on the way. Problem
solved. Doesn't have to be a fight

31:05.030 --> 31:08.672
It's just the one thing I asking you to do.
-I'm gonna build a time machine.

31:08.798 --> 31:09.675
Go fuck yourself!.

31:09.687 --> 31:12.353
Why do you have to go
from dormant to bitch so fast?

31:12.479 --> 31:14.509
Because you're a fucking cock.

31:27.430 --> 31:31.055
So, Hungary?
-Yes. Just for the last few weeks.

31:31.180 --> 31:34.985
Where were you before that?
-Prague, before that Madrid.

31:35.423 --> 31:38.975
I wish I can travel like that.
We never go anywhere.

31:39.100 --> 31:42.100
We just went to Paris.
-Five years ago.

31:43.687 --> 31:45.915
So, how's your Hungarian?

31:46.190 --> 31:51.110
It's keep me from starving
but it's about it.

31:54.020 --> 31:57.798
You are at home, Duchess.
- Aren't we dropping Joe off?

31:57.946 --> 32:00.212
I'm dropping Joe off.
-I can just walk.

32:00.338 --> 32:02.338
Really.

32:14.030 --> 32:17.153
Sorry I didn't mean to
interrupt a marital spat.

32:17.165 --> 32:18.210
It's all good.

32:19.399 --> 32:24.075
We really get the chance to talk shop.
-Are we going to?

32:24.821 --> 32:28.407
I was hopping to pick your brain.
-Sure.

32:28.587 --> 32:32.610
Are you planning your profession again
to pick up in D.C.?

32:33.594 --> 32:36.390
No, I'm not interest
in go back to work with the agency.

32:36.516 --> 32:39.245
No of course not.
There's no money in it. Any

32:39.257 --> 32:42.118
idiot can tell you that,
this idiot for example

32:42.899 --> 32:46.664
Guy like you, with your
public  profile and reputation ...

32:46.806 --> 32:50.120
... private sector must be all over you.

32:51.046 --> 32:56.735
I have some offers, but nothing
that I have seriously considered.

32:58.172 --> 33:02.097
I've been felling some offers
in the private sector myself lately

33:02.993 --> 33:06.719
If I'll you stick around a minute, we
could get together, compare notes.

33:06.731 --> 33:07.977
Sure.

33:08.607 --> 33:12.318
Bob always had good
things to say about you.

33:12.330 --> 33:14.647
Oh yeah ? What did he say?

33:17.240 --> 33:19.320
Oh shit I don't know...

33:25.438 --> 33:30.000
Here we are,door to door service.
-Thank you for the ride.

34:46.010 --> 34:47.025
Hey.

34:47.467 --> 34:53.150
Hey. Is Sammy ok?
-I think so.

34:54.000 --> 34:58.311
The rest of us maybe in danger.
-Especially our shoes.

34:59.030 --> 35:01.995
Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

35:02.135 --> 35:03.387
I'm not thinking straight.

35:03.411 --> 35:06.364
I'm going to go for a run, see
if I can shake something loose

35:06.490 --> 35:09.768
You hit your head, should be resting.
Especially if you can't think straight.

35:09.893 --> 35:13.159
I am fine.

35:15.879 --> 35:17.526
Ok.

35:18.801 --> 35:20.761
Be careful.

36:09.686 --> 36:12.596
A senior CIA officer has
been turn by the SVR.

36:14.334 --> 36:16.378
The information leaked
by him has already

36:16.402 --> 36:18.959
resulted in the death of
several American assets.

36:59.654 --> 37:03.010
... sorry for a second time ...

37:03.136 --> 37:08.086
I'm tired of having to
ashamed of your damn behavior.

38:11.990 --> 38:14.860
I'm sorry, Gordon.

38:18.516 --> 38:20.466
Me too.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.042
I wish you had faith in me.
-I do.

38:26.168 --> 38:32.413
No, not for a while.
And I know it's my own fault.

38:35.565 --> 38:37.510
I have a plan, Eve.

38:38.155 --> 38:42.035
It fixes everything so we
can start over.

38:42.523 --> 38:45.975
I'm gonna make our money troubles
a thing to the past.

38:46.100 --> 38:51.050
I want the past to be there as well.
-I'd like that.

38:52.010 --> 38:57.859
But you gotta believe in me.
-Gordon, honey,You know I believe in you,
you know I did

38:58.000 --> 39:01.530
Is that right?
-Yes. of course, always.

39:01.819 --> 39:05.593
Gordon ...come on...come on...
-You're incredibly gorgeous.

39:06.999 --> 39:10.914
Think about the kids.
-They sleep. We are all alone.

39:11.213 --> 39:15.588
And we never get to
take that ride in the car.

39:17.510 --> 39:20.924
Oh, my god ... Wait.
-Hurry up.

39:26.020 --> 39:29.706
You're such an asshole, Gordon.
-You do what is necessary.

39:29.832 --> 39:32.100
Shut up.
-Ok, good deal.

39:47.888 --> 39:49.778
We should talk.

39:56.020 --> 39:58.100
I was just about...
-Not here.

39:59.210 --> 40:01.100
Good.

40:51.080 --> 40:53.000
Arms up.

40:57.010 --> 41:00.504
Are we meeting with someone?
-My boss wants to say hello.

41:01.445 --> 41:03.405
You work for Reuel?

41:08.070 --> 41:10.020
What is this place?

41:14.754 --> 41:15.985
What is this?

41:16.277 --> 41:19.985
You're about to compromise
an ongoing agency operation.

41:20.110 --> 41:23.723
We work counter-intelligence.
Robin is an embed for the FBI.

41:25.078 --> 41:29.500
So, are you just a peeping tom or do you
have an agenda that I should know about?

41:34.140 --> 41:37.050
So you already set up on Gordon.

41:40.672 --> 41:44.030
You know he's the mole, right?
-Have a sit.

41:46.297 --> 41:48.167
Let's talk.
