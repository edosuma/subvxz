01:09.853 --> 01:11.150
On the other side
of the world...

01:11.188 --> 01:14.817
in Europe the Allied forces
are pounding the Germans...

01:14.858 --> 01:16.655
with relentless force.

01:16.693 --> 01:20.493
We do not expect to have
a winter lull in Europe.

01:20.530 --> 01:22.828
We expect to
keep striking...

01:22.866 --> 01:24.493
to keep the enemy
on the move...

01:24.534 --> 01:26.001
and hit him again
and again.

01:26.036 --> 01:28.334
1944, December.

01:28.372 --> 01:29.498
I was miles
from the front...

01:29.539 --> 01:31.166
and a stranger to war.

01:31.208 --> 01:32.835
Troops, fuel dumps...

01:32.876 --> 01:34.002
enemy units...

01:34.044 --> 01:36.012
they were pins
on a map to me.

01:36.046 --> 01:37.206
Champagne?

01:38.215 --> 01:39.682
Are you trying
to score a few points?

01:39.716 --> 01:41.843
Just trying to aid
the war effort, Hart.

01:41.885 --> 01:43.011
Tom.

01:43.053 --> 01:44.179
Sir.

01:44.221 --> 01:45.518
The captain needs a lift
back to the 106th.

01:45.555 --> 01:47.022
Can you find him a driver?

01:47.057 --> 01:48.854
I can take him, sir.

01:48.892 --> 01:50.519
Funny. I had a feeling
you'd say that.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.528
Well, there hasn't been
much movement today, sir.

01:52.562 --> 01:54.359
So I see. Captain.

01:54.398 --> 01:55.524
Oh, don't forget, sir.

01:55.565 --> 01:57.089
You wanted to send some of that
champagne along as well.

01:59.236 --> 02:00.362
Yes.

02:00.404 --> 02:02.338
Yes, thank you
for reminding me, Tom.

02:03.507 --> 02:04.997
The general should get
a kick out of that.

02:06.343 --> 02:07.469
Colonel.

02:07.511 --> 02:08.637
Troops are now fighting...

02:08.678 --> 02:12.307
along a battle line
of 300 miles in Poland...

02:12.349 --> 02:14.317
France, and Germany.

02:14.351 --> 02:16.819
Within 10 weeks
after the first landings

02:16.853 --> 02:19.151
in France last June,

02:19.189 --> 02:23.319
the Allies have landed
nearly 2 million men.

02:30.867 --> 02:32.494
You know what
this army could use, sir?

02:32.536 --> 02:33.833
Snowplow services.

02:33.870 --> 02:34.996
What we could use...

02:35.038 --> 02:36.335
is half a million gallons
of gasoline...

02:36.373 --> 02:37.670
and a road
that wasn't paved...

02:37.707 --> 02:38.867
for Bouncing Betties.

02:41.044 --> 02:42.511
German S-mines.

02:42.546 --> 02:43.706
Yes, sir.

02:44.548 --> 02:45.845
You really ought
to spend a night...

02:45.882 --> 02:47.042
on the line sometime,
Lieutenant.

02:48.552 --> 02:50.019
I know that, sir.

02:50.053 --> 02:52.681
Of course,
it's not too likely, is it?

02:52.722 --> 02:53.882
Sir?

02:54.891 --> 02:57.018
The Colonel says
your father is a senator.

02:57.060 --> 02:58.527
So I guess you won't
spend too many nights...

02:58.562 --> 03:00.052
in a foxhole, will you?

03:02.499 --> 03:04.467
It's nothing
to be ashamed of, son.

03:04.501 --> 03:06.332
That's a hell
of a father to have.

03:30.193 --> 03:31.854
-Where to, sir?
-St. Vith.

03:33.029 --> 03:34.997
I'm afraid you've gone
the wrong way, sir.

03:35.031 --> 03:36.362
St. Vith is due west.

03:38.702 --> 03:41.364
I'm pretty sure
St. Vith is due east.

03:42.539 --> 03:44.370
Sergeant,
it's straight ahead.

03:45.208 --> 03:46.368
Can I see that, sir?

03:53.049 --> 03:55.677
I drove this route
yesterday, Sergeant.

03:55.719 --> 03:56.879
Mm-hmm.

04:06.663 --> 04:07.823
Get your hands up.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.492
Out!

04:31.521 --> 04:32.681
Halt!

06:14.625 --> 06:15.956
Are you in great pain?

06:17.461 --> 06:19.088
First Lieutenant...

06:19.129 --> 06:20.926
Thomas Hart.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.124
Serial number...

06:23.467 --> 06:26.959
1841287.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.471
Would you care
for a cigarette?

06:33.977 --> 06:36.468
Your train is
an 8 kilometer march from here.

06:37.481 --> 06:39.278
Of course,
with some shoes on...

06:39.316 --> 06:40.476
you might be all right.

06:42.486 --> 06:44.283
First Lieutenant...

06:44.321 --> 06:45.481
Thomas Hart.

06:46.824 --> 06:50.817
Serial number 1841287.

06:51.829 --> 06:53.456
Thank you, Lieutenant.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.124
But we both know...

06:55.165 --> 06:56.996
there is much more
to you than that.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.772
Show me locations
of the fuel dumps.

07:07.778 --> 07:09.405
Just point...

07:09.446 --> 07:10.777
and we can end all this.

07:34.872 --> 07:36.635
I'll have your clothes
returned to you immediately.

07:37.641 --> 07:39.302
When you are dressed,
we'll have another chat.

07:40.144 --> 07:41.304
Our last one, I hope.

08:03.100 --> 08:04.397
Smile, Joe.

08:04.435 --> 08:05.868
For you the war is over.

08:48.145 --> 08:49.134
Lieutenant.

08:49.980 --> 08:51.311
This will help
against the cold.

08:52.816 --> 08:54.443
No thanks, soldier.

08:54.485 --> 08:55.611
I'll be all right.

08:55.652 --> 08:56.778
No, you won't.

08:56.820 --> 08:57.946
Come on. Take it.

08:57.988 --> 08:59.455
Just till you warm up.

08:59.490 --> 09:00.616
Take it, sir.

09:19.776 --> 09:20.902
Hey, Captain...

09:20.944 --> 09:23.742
does somebody tell our folks
about us being captured?

09:23.780 --> 09:25.407
Germans give a list
to the military...

09:25.449 --> 09:27.576
and the military
notifies the family.

09:27.618 --> 09:28.949
Is that voluntary, sir?

09:30.287 --> 09:31.584
How do you mean,
Lieutenant?

09:31.622 --> 09:33.419
Uh, I mean...

09:33.457 --> 09:34.788
can you ask them not to?

09:37.294 --> 09:38.454
I don't think so.

10:05.822 --> 10:07.653
Have to put
some straw in there.

10:09.159 --> 10:11.957
Straw in your shoes...

10:11.995 --> 10:13.155
for frostbite.

10:43.680 --> 10:44.977
Another slave detail, sir.

10:47.517 --> 10:48.814
Hey, ladies...

10:48.852 --> 10:50.319
next batch of shells
you turn out...

10:50.353 --> 10:52.480
nothing but duds
this time, all right?

10:52.522 --> 10:54.353
Mortars no boom boom, ja?

10:59.195 --> 11:00.321
Fire!

11:00.363 --> 11:02.422
Captain, P-51 incoming.

11:02.465 --> 11:03.762
-Incoming!
-Ours?

11:03.800 --> 11:04.926
Get down, everybody!

11:04.968 --> 11:06.128
Get down!

11:15.478 --> 11:17.207
Everybody stay down!

11:17.247 --> 11:18.407
Keep low!

11:23.320 --> 11:24.617
Captain, what's happening?

11:24.654 --> 11:25.780
Why are they
shooting at us?

11:25.822 --> 11:26.982
They can't read the roof.

11:31.494 --> 11:33.121
All right, get the doors!

11:33.163 --> 11:35.461
Everybody get the doors!

11:35.498 --> 11:36.658
Come on, now!

11:37.500 --> 11:38.660
Get down!

11:43.573 --> 11:44.870
Get down! Down!

11:48.845 --> 11:50.005
Hart, help out!

11:58.088 --> 11:59.715
-Come on!
-Go! Go! Go!

12:16.473 --> 12:18.134
Go on, now!
Let's go!

12:20.310 --> 12:21.436
Moving out!

12:21.478 --> 12:23.241
Get the other cars!

12:28.318 --> 12:29.785
Get the other cars!

12:29.819 --> 12:31.116
Let's go! Now!

12:31.154 --> 12:32.883
We're spelling out!

12:32.922 --> 12:35.117
Round up your men now!

12:35.158 --> 12:37.126
We're spelling out
our position!

12:37.160 --> 12:38.320
We're spelling out!

12:39.162 --> 12:41.790
Hart, get that man
clear of here.

12:41.831 --> 12:43.458
Let's get in line!

12:43.500 --> 12:44.967
Assemble on me!

12:45.001 --> 12:47.060
-Assemble!
-Move it! Move it!

12:57.347 --> 12:58.644
All right, men!

12:58.681 --> 13:00.205
Let's get back in line!

13:00.784 --> 13:01.773
Move it!

13:26.342 --> 13:28.742
It's not helping.

13:29.813 --> 13:30.973
Come on, men!

13:58.741 --> 13:59.917
Oh, Christ.

14:00.051 --> 14:01.018
Are you OK?

14:01.052 --> 14:02.679
Keep looking at me.
Look at me.

14:02.720 --> 14:03.880
Look at me.

14:05.156 --> 14:06.817
Oh, shit. Shit.

14:06.858 --> 14:09.224
All right.
Are you all right?

14:32.750 --> 14:34.081
They're telling us to march.

14:35.086 --> 14:36.951
Probably ought to take
his boots, Lieutenant.

14:39.257 --> 14:40.554
Lieutenant!

14:40.591 --> 14:42.559
Take his boots.

14:42.593 --> 14:44.390
'Cause either you
or some Jerry's gonna get 'em.

14:44.429 --> 14:45.555
Take 'em, sir...

14:45.596 --> 14:47.257
while you still got feet
to put 'em on.

14:48.599 --> 14:49.725
His socks, too.

14:49.767 --> 14:51.098
Ain't gonna help him any.

14:51.936 --> 14:53.096
Stay together.

14:55.606 --> 14:56.766
All right.

17:08.539 --> 17:09.699
Once again...

17:11.208 --> 17:16.373
I'm forced to remind you
escape is not a sport.

17:27.223 --> 17:28.384
Think of it this way.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.528
Now these Russians
have a chance...

17:31.562 --> 17:33.052
at a happy new year.

17:49.246 --> 17:51.237
Those are dogs
you're saluting, Colonel.

17:52.750 --> 17:53.910
Animals.

17:57.755 --> 17:58.881
My country doesn't make...

17:58.923 --> 18:00.390
those kinds of
distinctions, Colonel.

18:13.371 --> 18:14.702
They're our allies, Colonel.

18:15.706 --> 18:18.197
Oh, yes.
You and your allies.

18:19.543 --> 18:22.376
Let me tell you
about you and your allies.

18:26.217 --> 18:29.846
The Ministry of War
has just released the figures...

18:29.887 --> 18:31.548
from our offensive
in the Ardennes.

18:32.723 --> 18:36.022
Two hundred thousand Allies
killed or captured.

18:36.060 --> 18:37.186
Your Third Army--

18:37.228 --> 18:39.355
Patton--
in full retreat.

18:39.397 --> 18:42.855
And the wehrmacht has captured
enough abundant fuel...

18:42.900 --> 18:44.197
to retake Paris--

18:44.235 --> 18:46.726
perhaps even drive
your troops back to the sea.

18:48.072 --> 18:50.905
Might be a bit crowded
around here this winter.

19:07.024 --> 19:08.150
Turn around, Joes.

19:08.192 --> 19:10.285
Yes. Turn around.

19:18.536 --> 19:20.026
Ross. Hart.

19:21.872 --> 19:23.669
Ross and Hart.

19:23.708 --> 19:24.868
I'm Captain Ross.

19:26.210 --> 19:27.507
Major Clary.

19:27.545 --> 19:28.671
Lieutenant Hart.

19:28.713 --> 19:30.510
Lieutenant.

19:30.548 --> 19:32.015
Debriefing, gentleman.
Officer's hut.

19:32.049 --> 19:33.778
On the double.

19:33.818 --> 19:35.753
The German counterattack on
the American Third Army front...

19:35.753 --> 19:36.344
The German counterattack on
the American Third Army front...

19:36.387 --> 19:37.513
is still going on.

19:37.555 --> 19:38.681
The entire front...

19:38.723 --> 19:40.850
stretching about
30 miles south of Monschau...

19:40.891 --> 19:42.017
is in full view.

19:42.059 --> 19:44.357
On our side,
countermeasures are being taken.

19:44.395 --> 19:47.694
On the enemy's side,
more strafes are being flown in.

19:47.732 --> 19:50.030
This is a major German effort.

19:50.067 --> 19:51.694
Some of the best units
in the German army...

19:51.736 --> 19:53.226
were involved
in this penetration.

19:54.739 --> 19:55.865
At ease, soldier.

19:55.906 --> 19:57.066
Sit down.

20:01.245 --> 20:02.405
Thank you, sir.

20:06.250 --> 20:07.581
So tell me, Lieutenant...

20:09.420 --> 20:10.580
How come you're not dead?

20:11.422 --> 20:12.582
Sir?

20:14.091 --> 20:15.718
First you survive
crashing that jeep...

20:15.760 --> 20:17.887
then Hans and Fritz
take your boots.

20:17.928 --> 20:19.759
You got a rabbit's foot
in your pocket, son?

20:21.599 --> 20:23.897
Two horseshoes
and a 4-leaf clover, sir.

20:23.934 --> 20:25.094
Atta boy.

20:26.103 --> 20:27.229
By the way...

20:27.271 --> 20:28.602
you might want to take it easy
on that bread.

20:29.607 --> 20:32.075
You haven't had anything
solid for a while.

20:32.109 --> 20:34.236
Wouldn't want you to wind up
in the infirmary.

20:34.278 --> 20:35.438
I don't know, sir.

20:36.614 --> 20:38.582
After the march I just made...

20:38.616 --> 20:40.948
and infirmary might look
like the Waldorf to me.

20:44.455 --> 20:46.616
A stomach can shrink
quite a bit in 17 days.

20:47.958 --> 20:49.585
That's the number, isn't it?

20:49.627 --> 20:51.094
Seventeen days?

20:51.128 --> 20:52.925
Six days on the train...

20:52.963 --> 20:54.760
another 6 days of marching.

20:54.799 --> 20:56.266
What was it, Joe?

20:56.300 --> 20:57.460
Five days of interrogation?

20:58.302 --> 20:59.462
No, sir.

21:02.907 --> 21:04.067
Three days.

21:07.077 --> 21:10.069
Well, anyway...
easy does it.

21:11.415 --> 21:13.076
Yes, sir. Thank you.

21:14.251 --> 21:16.378
So this interrogator
they threw at you...

21:16.420 --> 21:17.751
his name wasn't Schumann,
was it?

21:23.594 --> 21:24.754
No, sir.

21:26.096 --> 21:27.256
Lutz.

21:30.935 --> 21:32.596
Schumann was a real prick.

21:33.437 --> 21:34.768
Almost broke me in two.

21:59.166 --> 22:00.997
Not much for small talk,
I guess.

22:01.034 --> 22:02.934
You come to appreciate that.

22:07.708 --> 22:08.868
Smoke, Lieutenant?

22:10.711 --> 22:12.042
Would you care
for a cigarette?

22:13.547 --> 22:16.038
Again, Lieutenant,
I need to ask you...

22:16.883 --> 22:18.043
the fuel dumps...

22:21.388 --> 22:22.548
Thank you.

22:25.726 --> 22:27.523
This Captain Lutz...

22:27.561 --> 22:29.722
he know much about
your operations at the chateau?

22:32.566 --> 22:33.726
He knew everything, sir.

22:35.068 --> 22:36.695
Fuel dump locations?

22:36.737 --> 22:37.897
Troop movements?

22:40.741 --> 22:42.368
Sir, he knew what
I'd had for breakfast...

22:42.409 --> 22:43.706
the morning of my capture.

22:50.917 --> 22:53.579
Point,
and we can end all this.

22:59.092 --> 23:01.526
Just name, rank,
and serial number.

23:06.032 --> 23:07.192
Good enough.

23:08.702 --> 23:09.862
You're excused, Lieutenant.

23:11.204 --> 23:12.501
Unfortunately,
we won't be able...

23:12.539 --> 23:13.665
to quarter you here.

23:13.707 --> 23:14.833
We're full up.

23:14.875 --> 23:16.433
We're gonna have to
put you in Barracks 27.

23:18.712 --> 23:21.180
Isn't barracks 27
for enlisted men, sir?

23:21.214 --> 23:22.340
Yes, it is...

23:22.382 --> 23:23.508
but as you can see...

23:23.550 --> 23:25.711
the Germans are doing a rather
brisk business these days.

23:26.720 --> 23:27.880
You'll be comfortable there.

23:29.055 --> 23:30.215
Sir.

23:34.561 --> 23:36.392
-Lieutenant.
-Sir.

24:14.534 --> 24:15.694
Point.

24:21.208 --> 24:23.005
Point or say
hello to stumps...

24:23.043 --> 24:24.203
for the rest
of your life.

24:36.056 --> 24:37.216
Good.

25:41.388 --> 25:43.015
Don, are you in?
I called.

25:43.056 --> 25:43.423
Hold your water, Joe.

25:43.423 --> 25:44.390
Hold your water, Joe.

25:45.392 --> 25:47.553
Looks like a whole division
just surrendered.

25:49.396 --> 25:50.556
Who's in charge here?

25:55.902 --> 25:57.028
Hey, how many we up to?

25:57.070 --> 25:58.697
Three lovely ladies,
big shot.

25:58.738 --> 25:59.864
That's right.

25:59.906 --> 26:00.964
That's right.

26:01.007 --> 26:02.474
-Excuse me.
-Yeah?

26:02.509 --> 26:04.306
I'm looking for
who's in charge here.

26:04.344 --> 26:06.175
From the looks of things,
I'd say Adolf Hitler.

26:07.681 --> 26:09.012
I'm Lieutenant Tom Hart.

26:10.016 --> 26:11.176
It's OK, folks.

26:12.185 --> 26:13.812
Staff Sergeant Vic Bedford.

26:13.853 --> 26:15.480
-Good to meet you.
-You, too.

26:15.522 --> 26:17.149
You just come in
from Ardennes?

26:17.190 --> 26:18.316
Yeah.

26:18.358 --> 26:20.485
Colonel sent me over
to bunk in here.

26:20.527 --> 26:22.017
Officers' barracks are full.

26:23.530 --> 26:25.191
Well, in that case,
welcome to Rio.

26:26.533 --> 26:27.659
Hope you don't mind, sir.

26:27.701 --> 26:29.032
All we have is this
middle bunk right here.

26:30.036 --> 26:31.663
It looks fine.

26:31.705 --> 26:33.832
I'm betting you're
a Lucky Strike man.

26:33.873 --> 26:35.670
You bet right.

26:35.709 --> 26:36.835
Care for some hooch,
Lieutenant?

26:36.876 --> 26:38.173
Ringing in the new year.

26:38.211 --> 26:39.838
Uh, thanks. I'm fine.

26:39.879 --> 26:41.346
It's fermented raisins,
mostly.

26:41.381 --> 26:43.178
A little turpentine
thrown in for flavor.

26:43.216 --> 26:44.342
I'm fine.

26:44.384 --> 26:46.352
We got anybody
left up front, sir?

26:46.386 --> 26:48.354
How are you doing,
Lieutenant?

26:48.388 --> 26:50.185
Private.

26:50.223 --> 26:52.851
Give him a break, fellas.
He just got here.

26:52.892 --> 26:54.359
Lieutenant.

26:54.394 --> 26:55.520
Guard 'em with your life.

26:55.562 --> 26:56.688
They double for cash
around here--

26:56.730 --> 26:57.856
especially with the guards.

26:57.897 --> 26:59.387
-Thanks, Sergeant.
-Excuse me a second.

27:00.667 --> 27:01.998
Fellas, listen up.

27:02.669 --> 27:03.795
Lieutenant Hart here...

27:03.837 --> 27:05.634
is going to be staying
with us for a while.

27:05.672 --> 27:07.503
-Hello, sir.
-Men.

27:08.675 --> 27:10.506
Say, what's it take
to get in that poker game?

27:11.344 --> 27:13.141
I expect we can work
something out.

27:13.179 --> 27:14.976
Good.

27:15.015 --> 27:17.984
Sir, are you about a size 10?

27:18.018 --> 27:19.144
Why?

27:19.185 --> 27:20.846
They got a Woolworth's
behind one of these barracks?

27:22.022 --> 27:23.182
You never know.

28:20.847 --> 28:21.973
Just piss on him, sir.

28:22.015 --> 28:23.141
Huh?

28:23.183 --> 28:24.514
It's the only thing
that gets him moving.

28:28.688 --> 28:29.848
Happy New Year.

28:49.442 --> 28:51.000
New year.

28:51.044 --> 28:53.877
It's 1945!

28:54.714 --> 28:56.204
Happy New Year!

29:04.324 --> 29:06.155
Ten and a half
is the best I could do.

29:07.660 --> 29:08.991
The holiday season.

29:33.853 --> 29:35.980
Look at the smile
on this guy.

29:36.022 --> 29:37.489
Socks, too.

29:37.524 --> 29:39.048
Could have used those
in the...

29:39.092 --> 29:41.151
What's the matter,
you don't like trench foot?

29:41.194 --> 29:43.822
Sure, it's just that
once my toenails turned black...

29:43.863 --> 29:45.694
I didn't have a single purse
that matched.

29:57.206 --> 29:58.332
Square 'em up, Major.

29:58.374 --> 29:59.534
Yes, sir.

30:10.286 --> 30:11.480
Look at this.

30:11.521 --> 30:13.853
They've got those poor bastards
going around the clock now.

30:14.957 --> 30:17.619
See that factory
up past the North tower?

30:17.660 --> 30:19.787
The Germans are making bombs
right under our noses.

30:20.730 --> 30:22.197
It's supposed to be
a shoe factory.

30:22.231 --> 30:23.698
Instead, they've got the
Russians running in and out...

30:23.733 --> 30:25.291
making mortar shells.

30:29.205 --> 30:30.695
What the hell is that?

30:33.743 --> 30:35.472
One of their flyers.

30:35.511 --> 30:37.877
Wait a minute, they've got
niggers flying airplanes, now?

30:37.914 --> 30:40.212
Three hundred and thirty-second
Fight Squadron.

30:40.249 --> 30:41.614
I read about them
in ''Yank Magazine.''

30:42.585 --> 30:43.609
I'll be damned.

30:43.653 --> 30:45.245
Well, we got us
some nigger officers.

30:46.756 --> 30:49.247
Fucking Jerry's right.
We must be losing this war.

31:01.270 --> 31:04.797
Five, 6, 7, 8. Lift! Lift!

31:18.654 --> 31:20.884
-Lieutenant.
-Sir.

31:25.728 --> 31:27.593
Looks like it'll be a good show.

31:27.630 --> 31:28.619
Yeah, it does.

31:31.067 --> 31:32.898
It's high stakes
around here, sir.

31:33.569 --> 31:34.558
What do you mean?

31:35.738 --> 31:37.365
Half the smokes in camp
are riding on...

31:37.406 --> 31:38.896
where you're putting
the new men.

31:41.911 --> 31:43.902
Where do you think
we should put them?

31:45.548 --> 31:48.540
I think I'd give them
their own billet tent, sir.

31:49.852 --> 31:51.342
Well, we can't do that.

31:52.822 --> 31:55.484
I was thinking about
putting them in 27 with you.

31:57.159 --> 31:59.821
Sir, wouldn't they be better off
in the officers' barracks?

32:00.563 --> 32:03.532
I don't carry enough weight
to move 2 officers out of 22.

32:04.200 --> 32:06.031
I can't make them
the only 2 officers...

32:06.068 --> 32:07.695
in the enlisted men's barracks.

32:09.071 --> 32:10.971
You're in 27.

32:11.007 --> 32:12.975
Figure you can keep
an eye on them for me.

32:13.009 --> 32:14.874
Sir, I'm still new
to that barracks.

32:15.845 --> 32:17.813
Don't carry a lot of weight
with the men yet.

32:17.847 --> 32:20.543
You've got bars
on your shoulder, Lieutenant.

32:20.583 --> 32:22.141
That ought to be weight enough.

32:26.822 --> 32:29.484
Be done. Come on.

32:29.525 --> 32:30.617
Tastes like chicken, right?

32:30.660 --> 32:32.719
No, you've got maggots.

32:32.762 --> 32:34.195
It's protein. Eat.

32:34.230 --> 32:35.857
-You called?
-Yeah.

32:35.898 --> 32:37.559
What do you got?

32:39.135 --> 32:41.433
Gonna have to to make
some room in here, fellas.

32:41.470 --> 32:42.528
Come on in, men.

32:42.571 --> 32:44.061
We got 2 more guests.

32:47.843 --> 32:50.903
Second Lieutenants
Lamar Archer and Lincoln Scott.

32:56.185 --> 32:57.914
You've got to be kidding, sir.

32:57.953 --> 32:59.944
They're gonna live here?

33:00.923 --> 33:04.154
Two officers just
entered the barracks.

33:04.193 --> 33:05.251
Where's your salute?

33:27.349 --> 33:28.680
What's the big idea, sir?

33:28.718 --> 33:30.447
I mean, we're all
full up in here.

33:30.486 --> 33:32.113
Not anymore.

33:32.154 --> 33:33.746
-Croutch, Krasner.
-Yes, sir.

33:33.789 --> 33:36.622
You've been reassigned.
Barracks 28.

33:36.659 --> 33:38.559
The Colonel wants you
situated before lockdown.

33:44.700 --> 33:46.361
What were you flying?

33:46.402 --> 33:48.734
P-51 bomber escorts.

33:49.405 --> 33:51.373
Must be a shitload
of dead bomber crews...

33:51.407 --> 33:52.704
scattered across Europe.

33:53.976 --> 33:55.568
You see these bars,
Sergeant?

33:55.611 --> 33:57.044
A pair of bars
don't make you fit to share...

33:57.079 --> 33:58.546
the same roof
with white folks, boy.

33:58.581 --> 33:59.548
Bedford!

33:59.582 --> 34:01.447
That's Lieutenant, boy.
You got that?

34:01.484 --> 34:03.975
Call yourself
whatever you want.

34:04.019 --> 34:05.646
You're still just
a nigger to me.

34:05.688 --> 34:06.882
I didn't quite catch that,
Sergeant.

34:06.922 --> 34:08.480
-What was that?
-All right!

34:08.524 --> 34:10.116
-That's enough!
-Just let it go.

35:19.695 --> 35:21.162
Set, go!

35:21.197 --> 35:22.528
Over--Over here!

35:24.033 --> 35:26.558
Nice. Very nice!

35:36.779 --> 35:38.440
Uh-oh! Deadline.

35:39.682 --> 35:42.446
Lieutenant!
Mind grabbing that, boy?

35:56.799 --> 35:57.823
What are you doing?

36:06.008 --> 36:07.703
Nice one, sir!

36:07.743 --> 36:08.437
Cookie, hey!

36:08.477 --> 36:10.035
More bread.
More bread.

36:10.079 --> 36:11.341
Das ist verboten!

36:11.981 --> 36:15.542
Das ist verboten, Bedford!

36:17.253 --> 36:18.618
Bon appetit!

36:43.012 --> 36:44.001
Shit!

36:51.387 --> 36:52.581
Nobody moves!

36:56.592 --> 36:57.889
How bad, Sergeant?

36:57.927 --> 36:59.690
Yeah, it's just a nick.
I'll be fine.

36:59.728 --> 37:01.696
-You all right?
-Yeah.

37:28.958 --> 37:30.448
Fuck 'em !

37:45.975 --> 37:48.205
-Go get that hand looked at.
-Yes, sir.

37:52.677 --> 37:53.644
Hey, Bed.

37:53.678 --> 37:55.236
Cigarettes?

38:14.399 --> 38:15.889
You're a regular bank, Vic.

38:19.037 --> 38:21.005
How's the hand?

38:21.039 --> 38:22.666
Is that really what you
came over here to ask me?

38:22.707 --> 38:25.232
No. Major Clary told me
that you went to see him...

38:25.277 --> 38:29.577
to lodge a complaint about
Lieutenants Archer and Scott.

38:29.614 --> 38:32.515
I'm sure he'll take it up with
Eisenhower first chance he gets.

38:33.685 --> 38:34.947
They don't belong here.

38:36.288 --> 38:38.313
Nobody belongs here.

38:38.356 --> 38:40.620
But this is where
the colonel put them.

38:40.659 --> 38:43.355
Yeah. I bet you wish the colonel
would have given you...

38:43.395 --> 38:45.090
that open bunk
in the officers' barracks...

38:45.130 --> 38:46.688
right about now, Lieutenant.

38:48.567 --> 38:51.764
I mean, this is hardly
the Waldorf.

38:51.803 --> 38:53.498
Ain't that right?

38:53.538 --> 38:55.165
We're not going
to have a problem...

38:55.207 --> 38:57.266
about this, Sergeant,
understood?

38:57.309 --> 39:00.836
What did you do before the war
for a living?

39:05.450 --> 39:08.351
I was in law school.
Second year.

39:08.386 --> 39:09.410
Harvard?

39:09.454 --> 39:10.443
Yale.

39:10.488 --> 39:12.786
-Meet many coloreds up there?
-A few.

39:12.824 --> 39:14.917
Yeah, well,
I dealt with their kind.

39:14.960 --> 39:16.791
Two years I was
on the police force...

39:16.828 --> 39:19.353
in East St. Louis,
and I know what they are.

39:19.397 --> 39:22.298
So let's not pretend like
we're fucking neighbors.

39:22.334 --> 39:23.801
You finished, Sergeant?

39:23.835 --> 39:25.268
No, I'm not finished.

39:27.806 --> 39:29.467
Never did settle on a price,
did we...

39:29.507 --> 39:30.804
for them boots and socks?

39:32.110 --> 39:34.078
I mean, might be as cold as
the North Pole around here...

39:34.112 --> 39:35.545
but that don't make me
Santa Claus.

39:38.483 --> 39:39.814
What do you want?

39:41.486 --> 39:42.817
I'll take your watch.

39:43.889 --> 39:45.789
This was a gift from my father.

39:45.824 --> 39:49.351
I bet your daddy
can afford you another one.

40:00.505 --> 40:02.405
Is this going to buy me
a little civility, Sergeant?

40:07.545 --> 40:08.705
Tons.

40:45.058 --> 40:46.423
Not much of a picture, is it?

40:48.561 --> 40:51.758
Well, we do feel
a little misled, sir.

40:51.798 --> 40:52.890
Guard told us
they'd be showing...

40:52.932 --> 40:54.399
the life and time
of Jesse Owens.

40:58.671 --> 41:01.401
You know, you men can sit
up front with everyone else.

41:04.911 --> 41:06.708
We're fine, sir.

41:06.746 --> 41:08.179
Nobody's going to bother you.

41:10.383 --> 41:12.078
I said we're fine, sir.

41:48.554 --> 41:50.181
That was nice, C.W.
That was 18 inches.

41:50.223 --> 41:52.350
Ah, come on, Joe.
It was 2 feet, at least.

41:52.391 --> 41:54.791
Hey, either way,
my record still stands.

41:54.827 --> 41:55.851
Cut it out, you guys.

41:55.895 --> 41:57.920
Up, up, up.

41:57.964 --> 41:59.124
Everybody.
Out of the way.

41:59.165 --> 42:01.326
-Out!
-Out of the bunks.

42:06.839 --> 42:08.329
Attention.

42:08.374 --> 42:09.841
Attention near the bunks.

42:09.876 --> 42:11.343
Now.

42:14.180 --> 42:15.943
Who is the ranking man in here?

42:17.116 --> 42:18.413
Lieutenant Thomas Hart.

42:20.453 --> 42:23.684
One of your men was out on the
compound tonight, Lieutenant.

42:25.725 --> 42:27.317
He was spotted
on the East field...

42:27.360 --> 42:29.487
removing a spike from
one of the billet tents.

42:30.663 --> 42:32.722
Your men are aware of
this camp's policy...

42:32.765 --> 42:34.960
concerning the possession
and concealment of weapons...

42:35.001 --> 42:36.161
are they not?

42:37.170 --> 42:39.400
Major, no one has
left this barracks.

42:57.423 --> 42:58.481
Whoa, wait a minute.
What the hell--

42:58.524 --> 42:59.491
Quiet.

42:59.525 --> 43:01.152
-But this is a plant.
-Quiet.

43:01.194 --> 43:02.456
-Somebody put that--
-Quiet.

43:13.472 --> 43:14.996
You bastard, I heard you go out.

43:15.041 --> 43:16.099
I should have seen this coming.

43:16.142 --> 43:17.973
Major, where are
you taking this man?

43:18.010 --> 43:20.171
Examples must be made,
Lieutenant.

43:20.213 --> 43:22.909
We take the safety of
our men very seriously.

43:26.352 --> 43:27.979
Major, where are you all
taking him?

43:28.821 --> 43:30.083
What did he do?

44:26.946 --> 44:27.970
I'll kill you.

44:29.015 --> 44:31.074
I'll fucking kill you, Bedford.

44:31.117 --> 44:32.482
You put that spike--

44:32.518 --> 44:34.076
Watch your mouth, nigger.

44:34.120 --> 44:36.111
You put that spike there.
Get off of me.

44:36.155 --> 44:37.622
-Lincoln, look at me.
-Get off of me.

44:41.761 --> 44:45.322
Can I let you go, Lincoln?

44:47.967 --> 44:49.264
It's a minor offense, Colonel.

44:49.936 --> 44:53.702
This man deserved 15 days
in the cooler, not execution.

44:53.739 --> 44:54.865
He attempted to escape.

44:54.907 --> 44:56.340
Bullshit.

44:56.375 --> 44:58.639
You dragged him out of his
barracks barely clothed.

44:58.678 --> 45:00.441
Your men lined him up
and shot him.

45:00.479 --> 45:01.946
This man wasn't trying
to escape...

45:01.981 --> 45:04.245
any more than those Russians
you hung the other day.

45:04.283 --> 45:05.307
Is he a dog?

45:06.152 --> 45:07.710
A lesser race?

45:09.455 --> 45:12.424
There's a word you
Americans use, as I remember.

45:13.859 --> 45:17.260
But of course, your country
doesn't make such distinctions.

45:18.064 --> 45:20.726
And neither do you, I'm sure.

45:20.766 --> 45:21.824
He was an officer...

45:22.802 --> 45:24.326
a lieutenant in
the Army Air Corps.

45:24.370 --> 45:27.362
Yeah. That's why you were
so eager...

45:27.406 --> 45:29.874
to welcome him and the other one
into your barracks.

45:30.977 --> 45:32.638
Look it up, Colonel.

45:32.678 --> 45:34.339
We have every right
to question a man...

45:34.380 --> 45:36.780
for concealment of
a dangerous weapon.

45:36.816 --> 45:38.374
This man had rights, too.

45:39.352 --> 45:40.444
The Geneva Convention...

45:40.486 --> 45:41.919
specifically forbids
summary executions.

45:41.954 --> 45:43.581
Take a look around you, Colonel.

45:45.291 --> 45:48.055
This is not Geneva.

45:54.767 --> 45:55.699
Where are you going?

45:55.735 --> 45:56.963
To check on my men.

45:57.770 --> 45:59.567
You're welcome to do so,
of course.

46:00.439 --> 46:03.875
In the meantime, I'll be looking
in on your barracks...

46:03.909 --> 46:07.003
to listen to what's on
the B.B.C. this evening.

47:00.733 --> 47:04.726
Now go see your men, Colonel.

47:07.339 --> 47:08.499
Good night.

47:41.433 --> 47:44.891
Not to love the Fuhrer
is a great disgrace

47:44.936 --> 47:49.270
so we heil, heil
right in the Fuhrer's face

47:53.545 --> 47:55.604
Is we not the super friend?

47:55.647 --> 47:57.638
Aryan pure supermen?

47:57.682 --> 47:59.650
Ja, we is der supermen

47:59.684 --> 48:01.652
Super-duper supermen

48:01.686 --> 48:02.584
Is this Nazi land

48:02.621 --> 48:03.781
Let's go.

48:11.897 --> 48:13.057
How's Scott holding up?

48:14.032 --> 48:15.624
It's hard to tell.

48:15.667 --> 48:16.827
He isn't saying much.

48:19.104 --> 48:20.503
He was asking about the body.

48:21.540 --> 48:23.974
And there's some personal
effects--dog tags.

48:50.168 --> 48:51.192
Come on, boys.

49:11.356 --> 49:13.153
Take that, you bastard.

49:13.191 --> 49:14.681
Careful, Bedford.

49:14.726 --> 49:16.751
That's a nigger
you're rooting for.

49:16.795 --> 49:18.558
Tail's painted red...

49:18.597 --> 49:21.760
means he's 99th,
right out of Tuskegee, boy.

49:45.290 --> 49:46.655
Come on, let's get him out!

49:47.626 --> 49:49.287
Get them out of there.

49:54.299 --> 49:55.891
Get him to the doc, now.

50:00.105 --> 50:02.232
Put this out. Come on!

50:06.178 --> 50:08.976
More buckets, more buckets.
Quickly, come on.

50:09.014 --> 50:10.276
Come on!

51:39.271 --> 51:41.364
-Move around this corner.
-Yes, sir.

51:41.406 --> 51:43.237
Do you know where
I wish I'd never been?

51:44.242 --> 51:45.436
Where's that?

51:45.477 --> 51:46.876
The goddamn Waldorf.

51:48.847 --> 51:49.836
It's not personal.

51:50.782 --> 51:52.579
He just can't stand
being lied to.

51:53.718 --> 51:56.016
-I never lied to him.
-Go on.

51:56.054 --> 51:58.522
You hung yourself the minute
he debriefed you.

51:59.524 --> 52:01.287
That guy Lutz
they threw on you...

52:02.127 --> 52:03.788
he was a level 1 interrogator.

52:04.729 --> 52:06.196
McNamara had him, too.

52:07.399 --> 52:10.698
When a guy won't talk, they just
keep kicking him up the ladder.

52:11.303 --> 52:13.430
Level 2, level 3.

52:13.471 --> 52:14.563
It takes weeks.

52:16.441 --> 52:18.204
He was in there for a month.

52:18.243 --> 52:20.108
The only guy you saw was Lutz...

52:20.779 --> 52:22.610
and he spit you out of there
in 3 days.

52:27.152 --> 52:28.744
All I gave them was name,
rank, and serial number.

52:28.787 --> 52:30.948
See, the thing about the colonel
is he's not like you and me.

52:30.989 --> 52:32.752
He's West Point,
fourth generation.

52:32.791 --> 52:34.759
He was raised on all this.

52:35.894 --> 52:37.293
The crap like this...

52:37.329 --> 52:39.797
catching a junior officer
in an obvious lie...

52:40.999 --> 52:43.297
all it does is remind him
of how far away he is...

52:43.335 --> 52:44.666
from the real war...

52:45.837 --> 52:47.327
the one he's supposed
to be fighting.

52:49.708 --> 52:50.970
You see?

53:33.184 --> 53:34.446
Lieutenant Lincoln.

53:47.031 --> 53:48.726
Should have sold some tickets
for this one.

54:29.841 --> 54:32.674
Two of your men dead
in 2 days, Colonel.

54:32.710 --> 54:34.337
It seems you've lost control
of your company.

54:37.482 --> 54:39.382
Will Lieutenant Scott be granted
the right to stand trial...

54:39.417 --> 54:40.975
and face this charge?

54:41.019 --> 54:43.146
Major Fussel saw him
standing over the body.

54:43.188 --> 54:45.088
I would say he's had his trial.

54:45.757 --> 54:47.952
Any prisoner accused of a crime
against another prisoner...

54:47.992 --> 54:49.254
has a right to a trial.

54:49.294 --> 54:51.455
And if the boy
were being held in Alabama...

54:51.496 --> 54:52.895
there wouldn't be
any trial at all.

54:52.931 --> 54:54.262
Is this not so?

54:55.099 --> 54:56.794
Yeah, maybe you're
right, Colonel.

54:57.836 --> 54:59.736
Maybe we should
just forget the trial.

54:59.771 --> 55:01.398
Let's just drag him
out of the barracks...

55:01.439 --> 55:02.599
and shoot 2 holes
in his chest...

55:02.640 --> 55:04.267
like you do with
Lieutenant Archer.

55:08.847 --> 55:10.007
A trial.

55:10.748 --> 55:11.874
A court-martial.

55:13.084 --> 55:15.416
Like in your American movies?

55:16.387 --> 55:17.479
Yes?

55:18.456 --> 55:20.117
Yeah, something like that.

55:21.459 --> 55:22.619
That should be fun.

55:23.962 --> 55:25.122
Yeah.

55:26.798 --> 55:27.958
All right, Colonel.

55:29.467 --> 55:31.094
You may conduct it...

55:31.135 --> 55:32.295
in your theater here.

55:47.965 --> 55:50.763
Colonel, my men are in
this theater every day.

55:50.801 --> 55:51.927
With your permission...

55:51.969 --> 55:53.095
we'd like to erect
a billet tent...

55:53.137 --> 55:54.263
to house the proceedings.

55:54.304 --> 55:55.430
No.

55:55.472 --> 55:57.599
Your theater
will do quite nicely.

55:57.641 --> 55:58.938
You have until
the end of the week...

55:58.976 --> 56:00.102
to conduct your trial.

56:00.144 --> 56:01.771
It's a capital charge,
Colonel.

56:01.812 --> 56:03.439
The trial will take
more than a few days.

56:03.480 --> 56:05.448
One thousand more American
prisoners from the Ardennes...

56:05.482 --> 56:07.450
will be arriving
over the weekend.

56:07.484 --> 56:09.952
I am putting them
in your theater.

56:09.987 --> 56:11.113
Colonel, I just
explained to you--

56:11.155 --> 56:12.315
Colonel...

56:13.157 --> 56:14.988
Saturday, your theater is mine.

56:28.772 --> 56:29.932
Wait. Colonel!

56:31.442 --> 56:32.602
This is a murder site.

56:41.785 --> 56:43.582
I beg your pardon,
Lieutenant.

56:43.620 --> 56:44.780
I said
this is a murder site.

56:46.290 --> 56:47.416
The body and
everything around it...

56:47.458 --> 56:49.426
are now evidence.

56:49.460 --> 56:50.757
This area cannot
be disturbed...

56:50.794 --> 56:52.284
until everything
is photographed.

56:56.467 --> 56:57.627
Of course.

57:10.147 --> 57:12.138
I'm appointing you counsel
for Lieutenant Scott.

57:16.320 --> 57:17.719
Sir, I'm not a lawyer.

57:17.754 --> 57:19.244
You sounded like one
a minute ago.

57:21.758 --> 57:23.089
I could be
a material witness.

57:23.927 --> 57:25.554
I mean, I heard
the lieutenant going out.

57:25.596 --> 57:26.893
The lieutenant
needs our help.

57:26.930 --> 57:29.228
I've appointed you counsel.

57:29.266 --> 57:30.426
Understood?

57:32.102 --> 57:33.228
Yes, sir.

57:33.270 --> 57:34.430
Dismissed, Lieutenant.

57:36.440 --> 57:37.600
Sir.

58:20.751 --> 58:23.219
And this guy
that's prosecuting me...

58:23.253 --> 58:24.584
this Captain Sisk...

58:25.589 --> 58:26.920
is he a real lawyer?

58:28.258 --> 58:29.384
Yes.

58:29.426 --> 58:30.916
That sounds about right.

58:33.430 --> 58:35.898
I think we have to paint
this thing as a fight, Scott.

58:35.933 --> 58:37.400
That's all.

58:37.434 --> 58:39.095
It was a fight
that got a little out of hand.

58:40.103 --> 58:42.765
You're supposed to ask me
if I did it, first.

58:44.775 --> 58:47.437
Look, I came here
to kill Nazis.

58:48.946 --> 58:51.073
If it was some crackers
that I wanted to kill...

58:51.114 --> 58:52.411
I could have stayed in Macon.

58:52.449 --> 58:54.576
Major Fussel ID'd you
standing over the body.

58:54.618 --> 58:56.085
Fussel is a Nazi!

58:56.119 --> 58:58.451
No. Fussel is a witness...

59:00.624 --> 59:01.784
and he's enough to hang you.

59:03.627 --> 59:05.754
Look, all I'm saying
is if it was a fight...

59:05.796 --> 59:06.922
that got a little
out of hand...

59:06.964 --> 59:08.261
then it's not murder.

59:08.298 --> 59:09.424
It's manslaughter.

59:09.466 --> 59:10.956
Do you understand that?

59:19.076 --> 59:20.236
Man, oh, man.

59:22.579 --> 59:24.547
Can I fire you?

59:24.581 --> 59:25.878
Oh, look, Scott,
I'm just trying--

59:25.916 --> 59:27.747
If it's a colored guy
on trial...

59:28.919 --> 59:32.047
and it's a white man
who's been murdered...

59:32.089 --> 59:34.387
there's no such thing
as manslaughter.

59:34.424 --> 59:36.392
Don't you know that?

59:36.426 --> 59:37.893
Or is that something
that they teach you...

59:37.928 --> 59:39.759
in the third year
of law school?

59:41.932 --> 59:44.230
What do you expect
from me, anyway?

59:44.267 --> 59:45.734
A ''Hey, yes, sir, boss.''

59:45.769 --> 59:49.398
Or ''Why, thank you, boss.
You're mighty kind.''

59:49.439 --> 59:51.907
Is that the way
a railroaded colored man acts...

59:51.942 --> 59:53.068
where you're from?

59:53.110 --> 59:54.236
Nobody's railroading you, Scott.

59:54.277 --> 59:55.904
Then how come
the only real lawyer...

59:55.946 --> 59:57.413
is the guy
that's prosecuting me...

59:57.447 --> 59:59.608
and I'm stuck with you
defending me?

01:00:02.953 --> 01:00:04.443
That's how the Colonel
wanted it.

01:00:05.789 --> 01:00:07.780
Yeah, but I ain't
being railroaded.

01:00:21.471 --> 01:00:23.439
I'll meet you
back at the barracks.

01:00:23.473 --> 01:00:24.633
Yes, sir.

01:00:36.319 --> 01:00:37.445
Well, Lieutenant?

01:00:37.487 --> 01:00:39.785
I'm gonna need
a few things, sir.

01:00:39.823 --> 01:00:41.791
Who has Bedford's
personal effects?

01:00:41.825 --> 01:00:43.122
We do.

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.957
I'll need to see them...

01:00:44.995 --> 01:00:46.656
and the photographs
that were taken of the scene...

01:00:47.497 --> 01:00:48.987
and of course, his body.

01:00:51.668 --> 01:00:52.828
What did Scott tell you?

01:00:54.171 --> 01:00:55.297
Sir?

01:00:55.338 --> 01:00:56.464
You were with him all day.

01:00:56.506 --> 01:00:57.666
What did he tell you?

01:00:59.009 --> 01:01:00.636
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't reveal that.

01:01:00.677 --> 01:01:01.837
Sure you can.

01:01:04.014 --> 01:01:05.845
Attorney-client privilege, sir.

01:01:07.350 --> 01:01:09.978
Only an attorney
has attorney-client privilege.

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.317
I need to be briefed
on everything...

01:01:11.354 --> 01:01:13.481
that Scott intends
to testify to.

01:01:13.523 --> 01:01:15.991
Sir, you're going to be
President of the court-martial.

01:01:16.026 --> 01:01:18.256
How can I possibly
discuss our case with you?

01:01:18.295 --> 01:01:19.421
Are you suggesting...

01:01:19.463 --> 01:01:20.623
that I would betray
Lieutenant Scott?

01:01:21.465 --> 01:01:23.092
That I would share
details of his case...

01:01:23.133 --> 01:01:24.293
with the prosecution?

01:01:27.804 --> 01:01:29.101
No, sir.

01:01:29.139 --> 01:01:31.937
Scott followed Bedford out
through the night latrine.

01:01:31.975 --> 01:01:33.272
If he testifies to that fact...

01:01:33.310 --> 01:01:35.278
every German in this camp
will know how we get in...

01:01:35.312 --> 01:01:37.280
and out of the barracks
after dark...

01:01:37.314 --> 01:01:38.941
and every man in this camp
would be compromised...

01:01:38.982 --> 01:01:40.108
because of that.

01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:41.617
Are you following this,
Lieutenant?

01:01:41.651 --> 01:01:43.141
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

01:01:45.489 --> 01:01:47.616
Now, Scott will testify
that he went out...

01:01:47.657 --> 01:01:49.284
through a hole
beneath the stove...

01:01:49.326 --> 01:01:51.453
in the barracks.

01:01:51.495 --> 01:01:54.293
And you will make certain
that he is clear on that.

01:01:54.331 --> 01:01:55.958
Do we understand each other,
Lieutenant?

01:01:55.999 --> 01:01:57.159
We do, sir.

01:01:58.335 --> 01:01:59.495
Dismissed.

01:02:00.837 --> 01:02:02.634
Permission to speak, sir.

01:02:02.672 --> 01:02:04.139
Speak freely.

01:02:04.174 --> 01:02:06.165
Scott thinks this is all
just for show.

01:02:08.011 --> 01:02:09.137
He thinks you passed sentence...

01:02:09.179 --> 01:02:10.510
as soon as the body
hit the ground.

01:02:14.518 --> 01:02:15.678
Is he right?

01:02:16.853 --> 01:02:18.787
Bedford's footlocker
is in my barracks.

01:02:19.790 --> 01:02:20.950
I'll make sure you get it.

01:02:58.161 --> 01:03:00.152
Not much to look at, is he?

01:03:08.953 --> 01:03:10.113
Did you know him?

01:03:10.955 --> 01:03:12.252
No.

01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:14.258
Not personally.

01:03:14.292 --> 01:03:16.283
But my guards certainly
seemed to.

01:03:17.562 --> 01:03:18.893
These are for you.

01:03:23.735 --> 01:03:24.895
Thank you.

01:03:27.905 --> 01:03:29.065
How well?

01:03:30.742 --> 01:03:32.710
Your guards,
you said they knew him.

01:03:32.744 --> 01:03:33.904
How well?

01:03:35.246 --> 01:03:38.238
Well, you'll have to ask them
about that.

01:03:44.922 --> 01:03:46.082
This is yours, too.

01:03:50.261 --> 01:03:51.592
We found it on his wrist.

01:03:53.097 --> 01:03:54.564
But with the inscription...

01:03:54.599 --> 01:03:56.396
and those new boots
on your feet...

01:03:56.434 --> 01:03:57.594
I made the assumption.

01:03:59.937 --> 01:04:02.565
It's a little hard
to imagine, Colonel...

01:04:02.607 --> 01:04:05.906
your guards
sitting for an interview.

01:04:05.943 --> 01:04:07.274
I can arrange it.

01:04:08.279 --> 01:04:10.440
I can arrange
anything you like.

01:04:12.617 --> 01:04:13.743
It seems only fair...

01:04:13.785 --> 01:04:16.345
what with your colonel
throwing you to the wolves.

01:04:18.623 --> 01:04:20.488
I'm not sure I follow you.

01:04:20.525 --> 01:04:21.685
Really?

01:04:23.494 --> 01:04:26.361
Yale isn't in the habit
of accepting half-wits.

01:04:27.498 --> 01:04:30.558
At least it wasn't
when I was studying there.

01:04:33.137 --> 01:04:36.436
The oldest member
of the class of '28.

01:04:37.642 --> 01:04:40.543
My fellow students voted me
hardest worker.

01:04:44.415 --> 01:04:47.851
But we can swap stories
some other time, can't we?

01:04:47.885 --> 01:04:50.649
Right now we've got a trial
to prepare for.

01:04:54.125 --> 01:04:55.956
It's a sincere offer,
Lieutenant.

01:04:58.830 --> 01:05:01.128
Anything I can do to help...

01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:03.260
Truly.

01:05:06.704 --> 01:05:08.934
And exactly where were you,
Major Fussel...

01:05:08.973 --> 01:05:10.270
on the night in question?

01:05:11.309 --> 01:05:13.937
I was walking the area
behind this theater...

01:05:13.978 --> 01:05:15.502
and the Australian compound.

01:05:15.546 --> 01:05:16.979
At about what time?

01:05:17.415 --> 01:05:19.542
Maybe about 1:00
in the morning.

01:05:19.584 --> 01:05:22.212
And can you tell the court
what you saw?

01:05:22.887 --> 01:05:26.687
The schwarz Lieutenant Scott
was kneeling over the body.

01:05:26.724 --> 01:05:30.091
It looked to me like he was
checking that the man was dead.

01:05:30.128 --> 01:05:32.153
I blew my whistle,
and he started to run.

01:05:32.196 --> 01:05:33.959
And what did you do next?

01:05:33.998 --> 01:05:37.092
I would have shot,
but it was dark.

01:05:37.902 --> 01:05:39.233
And so was he.

01:05:40.905 --> 01:05:43.203
Major Fussel, how well
did you know Sergeant Bedford?

01:05:43.241 --> 01:05:44.367
A little, I think.

01:05:44.408 --> 01:05:45.932
You traded with him regularly.

01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:47.536
Traded?

01:05:47.578 --> 01:05:48.704
Bartered.

01:05:48.746 --> 01:05:50.577
Cigarettes for a pair of boots.

01:05:50.615 --> 01:05:52.173
Chocolate for some spare parts.

01:05:52.216 --> 01:05:54.616
No. I never did this.

01:05:55.219 --> 01:05:57.483
A kriegie trading
with a German soldier?

01:05:57.522 --> 01:05:58.682
I never saw it.

01:05:59.357 --> 01:06:01.985
Am I allowed to repeat what
he actually said to Captain?

01:06:02.026 --> 01:06:03.186
You may, Private.

01:06:03.761 --> 01:06:05.524
Lieutenant Scott said,
''I'll kill you.

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:07.854
''I'll fucking kill you,
Bedford.''

01:06:08.499 --> 01:06:10.091
Corporal, have you ever
heard any other man...

01:06:10.134 --> 01:06:12.625
threaten a fellow soldier
during your time in the army?

01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:14.535
''Better shape up
or I'll kill you.''

01:06:14.572 --> 01:06:16.199
''I'll kill you if you touch
my cigarettes again.''

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.105
-That sort of thing?
-Yes, sir.

01:06:18.142 --> 01:06:20.702
I'll bet you've even made such
a threat yourself once or twice.

01:06:20.745 --> 01:06:21.871
I suppose so.

01:06:21.913 --> 01:06:23.608
Corporal, did you ever
actually kill any of the men...

01:06:23.648 --> 01:06:24.808
you threatened in this manner?

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:27.510
No, sir.

01:06:28.486 --> 01:06:29.646
But I'm not colored.

01:06:30.488 --> 01:06:31.648
I can control myself.

01:06:32.156 --> 01:06:34.124
So, you, too,
had heard the threats...

01:06:34.158 --> 01:06:36.251
made by the accused
against Sergeant Bedford?

01:06:36.294 --> 01:06:38.285
Your Honor, this being the
fourth prosecution witness...

01:06:38.329 --> 01:06:40.354
called to testify
in this matter...

01:06:40.398 --> 01:06:41.990
if the defense will stipulate
that the accused...

01:06:42.033 --> 01:06:44.331
did indeed threaten the life
of Sergeant Bedford...

01:06:44.368 --> 01:06:45.960
could we dispense
with any further testimony...

01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:47.163
-to his having done so?
-Your Honor...

01:06:47.205 --> 01:06:49.537
Sergeant Webb is being called
as an eyewitness...

01:06:49.574 --> 01:06:50.700
to the crime itself.

01:06:50.741 --> 01:06:52.265
He's what?

01:06:52.310 --> 01:06:53.470
Is that right, Sergeant?

01:06:54.078 --> 01:06:55.204
Yes, sir.

01:06:55.246 --> 01:06:56.508
-Sir, that's a lie.
-Your Honor...

01:06:56.547 --> 01:06:58.879
the sergeant will testify that
on the night of the murder...

01:06:58.916 --> 01:07:01.714
he watched through a window
in barracks 27...

01:07:01.752 --> 01:07:04.448
as Lieutenant Scott
accosted Sergeant Bedford...

01:07:04.488 --> 01:07:06.547
outside the theater
and broke his neck.

01:07:06.591 --> 01:07:07.717
Your Honor,
he did no such thing.

01:07:07.758 --> 01:07:09.157
I was standing
right beside Sergeant Webb...

01:07:09.193 --> 01:07:10.455
at the exact time
of the murder.

01:07:10.494 --> 01:07:12.462
-He saw nothing of the sort.
-The hell I didn't.

01:07:13.097 --> 01:07:14.564
You don't know what I saw.

01:07:14.599 --> 01:07:17.193
Sir, I request that this court
instruct this witness

01:07:17.235 --> 01:07:19.430
as to the consequences of
perjuring himself in a court--

01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:20.869
He put his hand on the Bible...

01:07:20.905 --> 01:07:22.338
and swore to tell the truth,
Lieutenant.

01:07:22.373 --> 01:07:23.499
-That's good enough for me.
-Objection, Your Honor.

01:07:23.541 --> 01:07:24.667
We've had no prior notice
of his testimony.

01:07:24.709 --> 01:07:26.336
-Sit down, Lieutenant.
-Your Honor, his bias alone--

01:07:26.377 --> 01:07:27.537
Lieutenant!

01:07:30.348 --> 01:07:31.508
Sit down, please.

01:07:43.227 --> 01:07:44.387
I'll catch up.

01:07:46.831 --> 01:07:48.731
I gotta go make some trades
in barracks 18.

01:07:48.766 --> 01:07:50.859
See if you
can get me some smokes.

01:07:50.902 --> 01:07:52.062
Webb...

01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:54.662
You're a lying sack of shit,
you know that?

01:07:54.705 --> 01:07:56.036
Yeah, and maybe you ought
to mind your own business.

01:07:56.073 --> 01:07:57.199
This doesn't concern you, West.

01:07:57.241 --> 01:07:58.799
-Hey, Lieutenant.
-Or you. Any of you.

01:07:58.843 --> 01:08:00.902
What do you know, Joe?
George S. Patton just showed up.

01:08:00.945 --> 01:08:02.708
Return to your barracks,
Corporal.

01:08:02.747 --> 01:08:04.180
Take your 2 friends with you.

01:08:09.453 --> 01:08:10.613
So, what is it, Webb?

01:08:11.022 --> 01:08:12.512
Up there today.

01:08:13.424 --> 01:08:14.652
You think you owe it to Vic?

01:08:16.627 --> 01:08:19.220
Why are you so bent about
that flying bellhop anyway?

01:08:19.263 --> 01:08:20.389
He's a soldier.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:21.955
Vic Bedford was a soldier.

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:25.066
He fought.
He had courage.

01:08:25.836 --> 01:08:28.167
You wouldn't know too much about
that, would you, Lieutenant?

01:08:28.939 --> 01:08:30.167
You lied in there today.

01:08:31.375 --> 01:08:32.966
You didn't see what happened
any more than I did.

01:08:33.010 --> 01:08:36.741
I didn't have to.
I know.

01:08:36.781 --> 01:08:37.941
Not good enough.

01:08:39.183 --> 01:08:40.707
It's good enough for McNamara.

01:09:03.808 --> 01:09:05.867
Sorry about what happened
in there today, Lincoln.

01:09:07.211 --> 01:09:08.404
I didn't see it coming.

01:09:11.148 --> 01:09:12.706
You're saying that's
the first time...

01:09:12.750 --> 01:09:14.411
you seen a man lie
through his teeth...

01:09:14.452 --> 01:09:15.783
holding his hand on a bible?

01:09:18.689 --> 01:09:20.782
I was writing a letter
to my father.

01:09:20.825 --> 01:09:23.089
Figured I should tell him first.

01:09:27.365 --> 01:09:29.856
He was part of
the 369th Infantry...

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:32.868
in the last war,
the old 15th.

01:09:33.738 --> 01:09:38.732
They was the first negro troops
to go into action in France.

01:09:41.145 --> 01:09:42.544
Did your father serve?

01:09:44.682 --> 01:09:46.206
My father
was in headquarters.

01:09:47.218 --> 01:09:48.617
He had an 8
on his shoulder, too.

01:09:48.652 --> 01:09:49.948
His father made sure of it.

01:09:51.555 --> 01:09:53.216
That's how we do things
in our family.

01:09:56.427 --> 01:09:57.587
That's a shame.

01:09:58.996 --> 01:10:01.055
Got your testimony to prepare.

01:10:04.135 --> 01:10:05.295
Yeah.

01:10:36.267 --> 01:10:37.427
Lieutenant.

01:10:38.102 --> 01:10:39.262
How are you?

01:10:40.905 --> 01:10:42.202
Not too well, I imagine.

01:10:43.274 --> 01:10:44.434
Come on up.

01:10:47.741 --> 01:10:49.936
That was quite a beating
you took today.

01:10:52.579 --> 01:10:53.739
It's warm inside.

01:11:03.957 --> 01:11:05.549
You've read Mark Twain?

01:11:05.592 --> 01:11:06.752
It's wonderful.

01:11:07.761 --> 01:11:09.661
Colonel, I have witnesses
to prepare for.

01:11:09.696 --> 01:11:11.186
Yes. I know.

01:11:12.099 --> 01:11:13.691
It's why I wanted to see you.

01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:32.815
We keep a library of all
American military manuals.

01:11:33.587 --> 01:11:36.920
I thought this one might be
of particular use to you.

01:11:41.828 --> 01:11:43.125
I can't accept this, Colonel.

01:11:43.163 --> 01:11:44.187
We have a policy
about fraternizing...

01:11:44.231 --> 01:11:46.426
Lieutenant,
without this, your client...

01:11:46.466 --> 01:11:48.263
will face the firing squad.

01:11:49.236 --> 01:11:50.567
Would that be better?

01:11:59.012 --> 01:12:00.206
Your son?

01:12:01.882 --> 01:12:03.042
Yes.

01:12:03.917 --> 01:12:05.077
Where's he fighting?

01:12:10.557 --> 01:12:11.717
He is not anymore.

01:12:14.261 --> 01:12:15.751
The Russian front.

01:12:19.533 --> 01:12:20.693
Horrible place.

01:12:24.204 --> 01:12:25.671
I'm sorry.

01:12:28.208 --> 01:12:31.336
I killed my share of English
and French, I suppose...

01:12:33.113 --> 01:12:34.375
in the first war.

01:12:36.783 --> 01:12:38.512
They had fathers, too.

01:12:48.929 --> 01:12:50.590
It's verboten, you know.

01:12:53.634 --> 01:12:54.794
Negro jazz.

01:12:56.803 --> 01:12:59.294
These might be the only copies
of their kind...

01:12:59.339 --> 01:13:00.499
in the entire Reich.

01:13:02.643 --> 01:13:05.908
But I'm quite fond of them.

01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:11.911
Nice to read by, anyway.

01:13:14.054 --> 01:13:16.079
Takes a man right back.

01:13:19.693 --> 01:13:21.126
Take a seat.

01:13:25.132 --> 01:13:26.292
Thank you for your time,
Colonel.

01:13:28.368 --> 01:13:29.528
Lieutenant...

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.600
Enjoy the manual.

01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:58.357
Come to order, gentlemen.

01:13:58.398 --> 01:13:59.922
Captain Sisk,
is the prosecution...

01:13:59.966 --> 01:14:01.194
prepared to call
its next witness?

01:14:01.234 --> 01:14:02.360
We are, Your Honor.

01:14:02.402 --> 01:14:04.233
Begging the court's pardon, sir.

01:14:05.038 --> 01:14:06.164
Yes, Lieutenant?

01:14:06.206 --> 01:14:07.332
Before we continue,
Your Honor...

01:14:07.374 --> 01:14:08.932
it's been brought to
my attention that the court...

01:14:08.975 --> 01:14:11.466
may have overlooked a few
procedural matters yesterday.

01:14:12.245 --> 01:14:15.373
I'm referring to the ''U.S. Army
Manual for Courts-Martial''...

01:14:16.349 --> 01:14:18.579
chapter 12, sections 57, 58.

01:14:19.686 --> 01:14:20.812
Make your point.

01:14:20.854 --> 01:14:22.287
According to these sections,
Your Honor...

01:14:22.322 --> 01:14:24.688
the court was obliged yesterday
to ask the accused...

01:14:24.725 --> 01:14:27.057
if he wished to challenge
any members of the court...

01:14:27.094 --> 01:14:29.961
for peremptory disqualification
before any pleas were entered.

01:14:31.798 --> 01:14:33.993
A little late in the game
for that, isn't it, Lieutenant?

01:14:34.034 --> 01:14:36.161
Nevertheless, it is a right...

01:14:36.203 --> 01:14:37.693
specifically granted
to the defendant.

01:14:42.843 --> 01:14:44.003
Very well.

01:14:46.546 --> 01:14:47.843
Does the accused
wish to challenge...

01:14:47.881 --> 01:14:49.212
any member of the court now?

01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:51.010
We do, Your Honor.

01:14:52.552 --> 01:14:53.712
You, sir.

01:14:55.122 --> 01:14:58.421
Request denied.
Proceed, Captain Sisk.

01:14:58.458 --> 01:15:01.359
Sir, according to chapter 12,
section 58d...

01:15:01.394 --> 01:15:03.191
defense is allowed
1 peremptory challenge...

01:15:03.230 --> 01:15:04.356
of the board,
and this challenge...

01:15:04.397 --> 01:15:06.695
is not subject to any ruling
by the court itself.

01:15:06.733 --> 01:15:07.859
Request denied, Lieutenant.

01:15:07.901 --> 01:15:10.426
Then the court must address
section 58e...

01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:12.165
which states the defense
may disqualify...

01:15:12.205 --> 01:15:14.002
a member of the board
for cause...

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.974
if that member
has displayed a bias...

01:15:16.009 --> 01:15:17.476
toward the accused or his case.

01:15:17.511 --> 01:15:18.978
This court has shown no bias
in this case, Lieutenant.

01:15:19.012 --> 01:15:20.138
Your Honor,
the court has demonstrated...

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:22.512
in ex parte conversations
before the commencement...

01:15:22.549 --> 01:15:26.349
of this hearing a distinct
prejudice against the accused...

01:15:26.386 --> 01:15:29.514
his case, and his counsel, sir.

01:15:45.172 --> 01:15:46.503
Very well.

01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:48.667
We'll take a short recess
to consider the matter.

01:15:50.043 --> 01:15:51.510
-Lieutenant Hart.
-Sir?

01:15:51.545 --> 01:15:53.206
Can I see you outside
for a moment, please?

01:16:07.494 --> 01:16:08.893
Sir?

01:16:08.929 --> 01:16:10.590
Listen to me,
you pampered little shit.

01:16:11.565 --> 01:16:14.227
I will not be laughed at.
Not by him.

01:16:15.235 --> 01:16:17.032
Sir, I'm just trying
to protect my client.

01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:19.368
Your client's about to lose
his lawyer, Lieutenant.

01:16:20.841 --> 01:16:21.967
Sir?

01:16:22.008 --> 01:16:24.909
Article 32: contempt of court.

01:16:25.545 --> 01:16:27.911
Article 70: intentional delay.

01:16:29.349 --> 01:16:31.146
I know the book, too.

01:16:31.184 --> 01:16:32.481
Forwards and backwards.

01:16:32.519 --> 01:16:33.986
Then you must know, sir, that--

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.851
Shut up and listen to me,
Lieutenant.

01:16:37.524 --> 01:16:40.857
You will not accept anything
from that commandant again.

01:16:40.894 --> 01:16:42.054
Is that clear?

01:16:42.729 --> 01:16:44.993
You will not allow him
to participate...

01:16:45.031 --> 01:16:46.726
in these proceedings,
is that clear?

01:16:47.801 --> 01:16:49.666
You will never set foot
in his office again...

01:16:49.703 --> 01:16:50.931
without my permission.

01:16:52.239 --> 01:16:53.399
We understand each other?

01:17:10.223 --> 01:17:14.091
...and propaganda reported
by them...

01:17:14.127 --> 01:17:16.687
and by the Germans
over Strasbourg.

01:17:17.464 --> 01:17:20.228
One minute you can hear
Hitler himself announcing...

01:17:20.267 --> 01:17:23.703
that he will be in Strasbourg
by January the 30th...

01:17:23.737 --> 01:17:26.900
the anniversary of the Nazis
coming to power in Germany.

01:17:27.607 --> 01:17:30.838
The next, the Nazis are claiming
that 2 new divisions...

01:17:30.877 --> 01:17:32.469
are advancing on Strasbourg...

01:17:32.512 --> 01:17:35.640
and that the Americans are
in full flight from Alsace.

01:17:36.683 --> 01:17:39.584
The closer they get,
the more violent they become.

01:17:39.619 --> 01:17:43.419
The Nazi menace are offering
their promises.

01:17:44.224 --> 01:17:45.248
But today...

01:17:45.292 --> 01:17:47.886
Come in. Have a seat.

01:17:49.629 --> 01:17:52.063
We've checked German...

01:17:56.369 --> 01:17:57.529
Have a drink.

01:17:58.204 --> 01:17:59.364
Sure.

01:18:02.208 --> 01:18:04.768
Maybe you can help me
decipher some of this code...

01:18:04.811 --> 01:18:08.406
coming through
the BBC tonight, yeah?

01:18:08.448 --> 01:18:10.006
I don't think you need
my help, Colonel.

01:18:11.685 --> 01:18:13.209
Seems pretty clear
what they're saying.

01:18:17.524 --> 01:18:18.957
It would seem so.

01:18:22.829 --> 01:18:26.629
Or perhaps
it's all propaganda.

01:18:27.133 --> 01:18:28.293
How about that?

01:18:47.112 --> 01:18:49.205
Strange thing about war wounds.

01:18:52.484 --> 01:18:56.716
The older you grow, the less
proud you become of them.

01:19:24.115 --> 01:19:25.776
Got another one of these
around here somewhere?

01:19:26.951 --> 01:19:28.213
Of course.

01:19:28.253 --> 01:19:31.347
Good. Why don't you and I take
a walk out on your compound...

01:19:31.389 --> 01:19:33.084
and have ourselves
an old-fashioned duel?

01:19:35.226 --> 01:19:37.660
That would be fitting,
wouldn't it?

01:19:39.130 --> 01:19:41.360
But surely you can think
of a more clever way...

01:19:41.399 --> 01:19:44.163
out of this camp
than that, yes?

01:19:51.076 --> 01:19:56.070
You think the war will wait
for you, is that it, Colonel?

01:19:58.283 --> 01:20:03.277
It won't, you know.
They never do.

01:20:10.662 --> 01:20:11.822
You're drunk.

01:20:13.164 --> 01:20:14.324
Yeah.

01:20:16.434 --> 01:20:18.698
But I'm seeing things
very clearly.

01:20:23.708 --> 01:20:27.610
You know, sometimes I think
your Lieutenant Scott...

01:20:27.645 --> 01:20:29.613
might have been better off
in Alabama.

01:20:30.849 --> 01:20:33.579
Lynchings are over in minutes.

01:20:35.186 --> 01:20:39.623
The kind of justice he's
suffering here is far crueler.

01:20:40.558 --> 01:20:42.753
Is that why you gave
Lieutenant Hart the manual?

01:20:44.095 --> 01:20:46.655
I was merely
trying to help the lad.

01:20:47.532 --> 01:20:48.658
He's got enough
to worry about...

01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:50.429
without providing you
with amusement.

01:20:52.203 --> 01:20:53.363
Yes.

01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:58.065
He's got you to worry about,
hasn't he?

01:20:59.744 --> 01:21:01.211
Stay out of our business.

01:21:03.882 --> 01:21:07.511
Forgive me, Colonel,
but you're hardly...

01:21:07.552 --> 01:21:09.645
in a position
to hand out orders.

01:21:11.256 --> 01:21:12.518
Especially to me.

01:21:18.329 --> 01:21:19.489
For now.

01:21:31.843 --> 01:21:33.310
Unless, of course,
you think that's just...

01:21:33.344 --> 01:21:35.676
the sound of propaganda
falling out there.

01:21:46.424 --> 01:21:48.984
Well, the idea was
to follow Bedford...

01:21:49.027 --> 01:21:50.722
and catch him
on the compound.

01:21:50.762 --> 01:21:52.957
I wanted to drag him back
under the barracks...

01:21:52.997 --> 01:21:54.430
and put his face in the mud.

01:21:54.999 --> 01:21:56.933
Well, by the time
I got to him...

01:21:56.968 --> 01:21:58.936
he was already dead
behind the theater...

01:21:58.970 --> 01:22:00.437
neck had been snapped.

01:22:00.472 --> 01:22:01.962
That's when everything blew up.

01:22:02.006 --> 01:22:05.464
Dogs, you know, hands up,
and that was that.

01:22:06.010 --> 01:22:07.341
Lieutenant,
did you apply anything...

01:22:07.378 --> 01:22:09.972
to your face or hands
before going out that night?

01:22:10.448 --> 01:22:12.245
Shoe polish? Soot?

01:22:12.283 --> 01:22:13.682
No.

01:22:13.718 --> 01:22:15.208
Defense exhibit 1, Your Honor.

01:22:16.354 --> 01:22:18.652
Photos of the deceased taken
in the camp morgue.

01:22:19.824 --> 01:22:21.314
The court will note
black smudges...

01:22:21.359 --> 01:22:23.122
on Bedford's right cheek
and jaw.

01:22:25.163 --> 01:22:27.563
Your Honor, what is
the relevance of this?

01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:29.626
To demonstrate to the court...

01:22:29.667 --> 01:22:31.760
that whoever killed
Vic Bedford was white.

01:22:33.404 --> 01:22:34.666
I'd like to ask
the court's permission...

01:22:34.706 --> 01:22:36.833
to conduct a demonstration,
Your Honor.

01:22:36.875 --> 01:22:39.435
I'd also ask the trial judge
advocate to rise, if he would.

01:22:40.512 --> 01:22:41.672
Proceed.

01:22:43.648 --> 01:22:45.809
Based on Bedford's wounds
and the fact that...

01:22:45.850 --> 01:22:48.011
nobody reported hearing him
cry for help that night...

01:22:48.052 --> 01:22:49.815
we have to assume
that he was either...

01:22:49.854 --> 01:22:51.185
friendly with his assailant...

01:22:51.222 --> 01:22:53.417
or that whoever killed him
did so from behind...

01:22:53.458 --> 01:22:55.119
the positioning being
something like this.

01:22:55.159 --> 01:22:56.683
Captain, if you wouldn't mind
grabbing at me...

01:22:57.228 --> 01:22:58.957
at my face
to get me to stop.

01:22:59.497 --> 01:23:01.362
Now, of course, the killer
had the benefits...

01:23:01.399 --> 01:23:04.664
of leverage and surprise,
so the neck was snapped...

01:23:05.970 --> 01:23:09.736
and Bedford fell,
and the smudge went with him.

01:23:10.074 --> 01:23:12.201
It was also on his fingers.
Captain?

01:23:15.513 --> 01:23:16.741
At this time,
I would like the court...

01:23:16.781 --> 01:23:18.271
to note the following
for the record:

01:23:18.316 --> 01:23:20.045
whoever killed Vic Bedford...

01:23:20.084 --> 01:23:22.552
had such a substance on his face
on the night of the murder...

01:23:23.221 --> 01:23:24.586
which raises 2 questions.

01:23:25.423 --> 01:23:28.051
First, what call
would Lincoln Scott have...

01:23:28.092 --> 01:23:29.525
for darkening his face?

01:23:29.561 --> 01:23:30.994
To look more black?

01:23:31.029 --> 01:23:34.726
Second, if he had done so,
when did he take it off?

01:23:34.766 --> 01:23:35.994
Your Honor, you stood
face to face with him...

01:23:36.034 --> 01:23:37.228
immediately
after his capture.

01:23:37.268 --> 01:23:38.462
His face was clean.

01:23:39.304 --> 01:23:40.464
I think it's fair to conclude...

01:23:40.505 --> 01:23:43.303
that whoever killed Vic Bedford
was not only white...

01:23:43.341 --> 01:23:45.468
but was waiting
behind this theater...

01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:48.035
face blackened to avoid
detection by the guards.

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:50.177
Nothing further, Your Honor.

01:23:51.215 --> 01:23:54.207
Lieutenant, you say that
Sergeant Bedford sneaked out...

01:23:54.252 --> 01:23:57.847
through a loose board
beneath the barracks' stove.

01:23:59.157 --> 01:24:00.351
Is that right?

01:24:05.763 --> 01:24:06.889
Yes, sir.

01:24:06.931 --> 01:24:08.956
And you took that same route
on the night in question...

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.262
after he'd gone out.

01:24:12.403 --> 01:24:13.631
Yes, I did, sir.

01:24:14.305 --> 01:24:15.966
What did you find down there,
Lieutenant?

01:24:16.708 --> 01:24:17.766
Excuse me, sir?

01:24:17.809 --> 01:24:20.642
What was down there
on the ground?

01:24:22.614 --> 01:24:25.048
Mud, right?

01:24:25.083 --> 01:24:27.278
You stated that it had been
your intention...

01:24:27.318 --> 01:24:29.343
to put the victim's face
in the mud...

01:24:29.387 --> 01:24:31.014
until he begged you to stop...

01:24:31.055 --> 01:24:33.546
so there was mud down there,
isn't that right, Lieutenant?

01:24:34.726 --> 01:24:35.920
I suppose so.

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.520
And a fair amount of soot
from the stove itself.

01:24:39.597 --> 01:24:42.031
So it's possible
that Sergeant Bedford...

01:24:42.066 --> 01:24:44.466
having descended through
a hole lined with soot...

01:24:44.502 --> 01:24:45.992
and then having crawled
facedown...

01:24:46.037 --> 01:24:48.471
beneath the barracks
wet with mud...

01:24:48.506 --> 01:24:52.033
might have emerged with mud
and soot on his face.

01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:56.740
Nothing further, Your Honor.

01:24:59.350 --> 01:25:00.544
Thank you, Captain Sisk.

01:25:01.853 --> 01:25:03.252
Will you step down, Lieutenant?

01:25:08.192 --> 01:25:09.352
Lieutenant Scott?

01:25:13.998 --> 01:25:15.260
You know how hard they tried...

01:25:15.299 --> 01:25:19.827
to wash us out of flight
school--the colored flyers?

01:25:20.538 --> 01:25:21.971
Your testimony's been entered,
Lieutenant.

01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:23.766
You can step down.

01:25:23.808 --> 01:25:25.366
It was test after test.

01:25:26.978 --> 01:25:30.243
I mean, anything they
could come up with to turn us...

01:25:30.281 --> 01:25:33.910
into the cooks or the drivers
or the shit shovelers.

01:25:33.951 --> 01:25:35.509
Your Honor,
this is highly unnecessary.

01:25:35.553 --> 01:25:39.011
-The witness has already--
-But I refused to wash out.

01:25:39.057 --> 01:25:42.618
So did Archer.
I mean, come hell or high water.

01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:43.957
We hit the books.

01:25:43.995 --> 01:25:45.485
We were just determined...

01:25:45.530 --> 01:25:49.489
that we were not going to spend
the war being some niggers.

01:25:49.534 --> 01:25:51.434
That's enough, Lieutenant.
You will take your seat.

01:25:51.469 --> 01:25:52.629
With all due respect, sir...

01:25:52.670 --> 01:25:55.503
I would like to exercise
my right and address this court.

01:25:56.274 --> 01:25:59.539
Now, I've been sitting down
ever since I got here.

01:26:00.845 --> 01:26:03.006
And you know, I should have
stood up and said something...

01:26:03.047 --> 01:26:05.277
the moment that you threw us in
with the enlisted men...

01:26:05.316 --> 01:26:08.376
instead of quartering us
properly as officers.

01:26:15.226 --> 01:26:16.557
But it's OK.

01:26:17.962 --> 01:26:19.862
You see, colored men
expect to have to jump...

01:26:19.897 --> 01:26:22.627
through a few hoops
in this man's army.

01:26:22.667 --> 01:26:25.431
Archer knew that.
We all did.

01:26:29.736 --> 01:26:35.504
There's a camp right outside
of Macon, where I'm from, and...

01:26:36.943 --> 01:26:39.912
there the army sends
the German POWs...

01:26:41.648 --> 01:26:43.639
puts them to work
picking cotton.

01:26:46.486 --> 01:26:48.113
But what's strange is
every once in a while...

01:26:48.154 --> 01:26:50.179
we'd see them
walking through town...

01:26:50.590 --> 01:26:53.821
going to movies,
eating in diners...

01:26:54.694 --> 01:26:56.719
but if I wanted to go
to those same movies...

01:26:56.763 --> 01:26:58.697
I had to sit way off
in the balcony.

01:26:59.099 --> 01:27:02.432
And those diners were closed
to me even in uniform.

01:27:03.169 --> 01:27:06.969
But German POWs were allowed
to sit there and eat.

01:27:07.007 --> 01:27:08.133
And this must have happened...

01:27:08.174 --> 01:27:10.642
to at least half the guys
at Tuskegee.

01:27:10.677 --> 01:27:11.803
But the thing is...

01:27:11.845 --> 01:27:15.474
we just kept telling ourselves
that no matter what...

01:27:15.515 --> 01:27:18.643
as long as we did our jobs,
it'd all be worth it...

01:27:18.685 --> 01:27:22.519
because hey, the war would end,
we could go home...

01:27:22.555 --> 01:27:25.319
and be free to walk down
any street in America...

01:27:25.358 --> 01:27:28.623
with our heads held high as men.

01:27:30.997 --> 01:27:33.090
So that's what we did.

01:27:33.133 --> 01:27:34.498
We did our jobs.

01:27:39.372 --> 01:27:44.071
We served our country, sir,
Archer and I.

01:27:45.111 --> 01:27:46.840
And what you
let happen to him...

01:27:48.348 --> 01:27:50.680
what you allowed to happen
to him...

01:27:52.919 --> 01:27:54.352
was appalling.

01:27:59.326 --> 01:28:00.657
And so is this.

01:28:23.947 --> 01:28:24.971
At ease, Lieutenant.

01:28:33.723 --> 01:28:35.020
How are they treating you?

01:28:36.659 --> 01:28:38.559
No worse than the men
in my barracks, sir.

01:28:43.066 --> 01:28:45.034
I can probably find you
another blanket.

01:28:45.068 --> 01:28:46.126
No. I'm fine.

01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:04.682
Good night.

01:30:32.142 --> 01:30:33.131
New order, gentlemen.

01:30:33.176 --> 01:30:36.339
Before you proceed, Your Honor,
the defense hasn't rested yet.

01:30:36.379 --> 01:30:37.937
Still like to call
one last witness.

01:30:41.050 --> 01:30:44.042
Defense calls
Oberst Werner Visser.

01:30:48.258 --> 01:30:49.657
This some kind of joke,
Lieutenant?

01:30:49.692 --> 01:30:51.182
He's material to our case, sir.

01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:54.824
Unless, of course,
the colonel refuses to testify.

01:30:57.767 --> 01:30:58.859
He does not.

01:31:06.075 --> 01:31:07.064
Colonel, could you tell us...

01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:08.873
the nature of your relationship
with Vic Bedford?

01:31:09.812 --> 01:31:12.542
I'll be happy to.
I didn't have one.

01:31:12.582 --> 01:31:14.641
And what about your guards,
Colonel?

01:31:15.351 --> 01:31:16.682
Major Fussel, for instance?

01:31:17.687 --> 01:31:19.882
Were you aware of his dealings
with Vic Bedford...

01:31:19.923 --> 01:31:22.084
at night after lockdown?

01:31:23.259 --> 01:31:25.523
That would be impossible
in this camp, Lieutenant.

01:31:25.562 --> 01:31:26.586
Policy forbids.

01:31:29.032 --> 01:31:30.329
Do you remember
the conversation we had...

01:31:30.366 --> 01:31:32.095
in the camp morgue 4 days ago?

01:31:33.369 --> 01:31:34.563
Vaguely.

01:31:34.604 --> 01:31:36.902
I asked you
if you knew Vic Bedford...

01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:41.036
and you said, ''No, but my guards
certainly seem to.''

01:31:41.077 --> 01:31:42.408
Perhaps.

01:31:42.445 --> 01:31:43.810
So, in your words...

01:31:43.846 --> 01:31:46.144
no guard ever traded with
Vic Bedford...

01:31:46.182 --> 01:31:49.345
and yet he was able to acquire
winter boots...

01:31:49.385 --> 01:31:53.344
thick socks, fresh milk,
and parts for a hidden radio.

01:31:53.389 --> 01:31:54.481
Isn't that a fact?

01:31:55.725 --> 01:31:59.559
Lieutenant, I'm sitting here as
a gesture of military courtesy.

01:32:00.730 --> 01:32:03.494
If it is your intention
to paint me as a liar--

01:32:03.533 --> 01:32:05.194
No, Colonel.

01:32:05.235 --> 01:32:06.634
It is my intention
to establish...

01:32:06.669 --> 01:32:09.035
that Vic Bedford built up
enough of a rapport...

01:32:09.072 --> 01:32:11.438
with your majors Wirtz
and Fussel...

01:32:11.474 --> 01:32:14.375
to engage in the framing of
Lamar Archer...

01:32:14.410 --> 01:32:16.310
conspiring with them
in the tent spike incident...

01:32:16.346 --> 01:32:18.644
which resulted in
Archer's death.

01:32:18.681 --> 01:32:22.014
Lieutenant Archer was shot
while attempting escape.

01:32:22.051 --> 01:32:23.313
No, Colonel.

01:32:23.353 --> 01:32:26.982
Lieutenant Archer was executed
in return for information.

01:32:28.958 --> 01:32:29.982
Archer dies.

01:32:31.027 --> 01:32:32.016
Five minutes later...

01:32:32.061 --> 01:32:35.053
Colonel Visser and Major Wirtz
enter Barracks 22...

01:32:35.865 --> 01:32:37.059
and destroy a hidden radio...

01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:38.829
that they had been trying
to locate for months.

01:32:48.044 --> 01:32:50.103
Can you tell the court anything
about these items, sir?

01:32:51.014 --> 01:32:53.414
Identification papers,
some currency.

01:32:54.250 --> 01:32:55.239
What of them?

01:32:55.285 --> 01:32:58.812
Perfect German-made I.D. papers
and reichsmarks.

01:33:00.290 --> 01:33:01.314
Two thousand of them.

01:33:04.794 --> 01:33:06.591
More than enough cash to make it
through the country.

01:33:07.730 --> 01:33:10.028
Vic Bedford kept those
in a stash beside his bunk.

01:33:10.066 --> 01:33:11.192
Again, can you tell the court...

01:33:11.234 --> 01:33:12.997
the nature of your relationship
with Vic Bedford?

01:33:13.036 --> 01:33:14.936
I did not have one, Lieutenant.

01:33:14.971 --> 01:33:15.960
Do you have any idea...

01:33:16.005 --> 01:33:17.905
how he may have gotten
these items, sir?

01:33:19.042 --> 01:33:20.441
If they didn't come from you...

01:33:20.476 --> 01:33:22.910
and if he never had any dealings
with your guards...

01:33:22.945 --> 01:33:24.276
the fact is, Colonel...

01:33:24.314 --> 01:33:26.976
Vic Bedford traded with you
and your men regularly.

01:33:27.016 --> 01:33:28.005
Objection, Your Honor!

01:33:28.051 --> 01:33:30.019
As soon as he came up dry
on you, you ordered his murder.

01:33:30.053 --> 01:33:31.520
Isn't that right, Colonel?

01:33:31.554 --> 01:33:32.578
Lieutenant Hart...

01:33:34.190 --> 01:33:37.023
I thought you tried
marvelously...

01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:41.019
to establish that the killer had
blackened his face with soot.

01:33:41.864 --> 01:33:44.458
Now, if any of my guards...

01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:47.697
or even I wanted to kill
one of my prisoners--

01:33:47.737 --> 01:33:49.261
Vic Bedford in this case--

01:33:50.473 --> 01:33:53.533
we would hardly need to blacken
our faces to do it.

01:33:55.044 --> 01:33:56.068
Would we?

01:36:39.457 --> 01:36:41.789
Move. In the corner, Webb.

01:37:27.672 --> 01:37:28.696
Captain.

01:37:41.653 --> 01:37:42.677
You see?

01:37:44.189 --> 01:37:46.316
German uniforms, explosives.

01:37:47.458 --> 01:37:49.483
Yes, Captain, I see.

01:37:50.495 --> 01:37:52.656
The trial's got nothing to do
with Lincoln Scott, does it?

01:37:53.698 --> 01:37:54.722
No.

01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:57.028
It's the way it had to go.

01:37:58.503 --> 01:37:59.663
We're out of time, Hart.

01:38:01.005 --> 01:38:02.336
We lose this theater tomorrow.

01:38:02.373 --> 01:38:05.035
Uh-huh, and I'm supposed to keep
Visser and his men distracted...

01:38:05.076 --> 01:38:06.168
while half the camp goes out.

01:38:06.978 --> 01:38:08.343
Is that it, Captain?

01:38:13.151 --> 01:38:14.482
I'm asking
the wrong fucking guy.

01:38:31.836 --> 01:38:33.167
I've just seen the tunnel,
Colonel.

01:38:39.677 --> 01:38:40.701
In here, Lieutenant.

01:38:59.631 --> 01:39:01.690
Everything in this place
is a lie.

01:39:01.733 --> 01:39:02.757
Everything.

01:39:10.341 --> 01:39:11.365
Jesus Christ.

01:39:14.445 --> 01:39:16.242
First he told the Germans
about the radio.

01:39:17.815 --> 01:39:18.804
It was only a matter of time...

01:39:18.850 --> 01:39:20.215
before he told them about
the tunnel.

01:39:24.822 --> 01:39:25.846
You killed Bedford.

01:39:29.994 --> 01:39:31.018
That's right.

01:39:39.337 --> 01:39:42.306
If you fuck with this operation
in any way, I'll kill you, too.

01:39:47.178 --> 01:39:48.645
You will sit in
that courtroom...

01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:50.944
as Captain Sisk drags out
these proceedings.

01:39:52.684 --> 01:39:55.585
Make whatever summation
you like, but that's it.

01:39:57.355 --> 01:39:59.323
When that board breaks
to deliberate,

01:39:59.357 --> 01:40:00.984
35 men go under the wire.

01:40:01.025 --> 01:40:02.583
And Lincoln Scott will be dead.

01:40:02.627 --> 01:40:03.616
That's war, Lieutenant.

01:40:03.661 --> 01:40:05.322
The war's at the front, Colonel.
We're not even in it anymore.

01:40:05.363 --> 01:40:06.387
Speak for yourself!

01:40:09.367 --> 01:40:10.356
You know those Russians...

01:40:10.401 --> 01:40:11.493
they march in and out of here
every day?

01:40:12.303 --> 01:40:14.134
-You know where they go?
-Munitions plant.

01:40:14.172 --> 01:40:16.470
The army thinks
it's a goddamn shoe factory.

01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:23.004
Look...

01:40:23.948 --> 01:40:26.109
I don't want to see Scott dead
any more than you do.

01:40:27.185 --> 01:40:28.880
But if one man
has to be sacrificed...

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:29.909
to take out that target...

01:40:29.954 --> 01:40:31.444
then that's the way
it has to be.

01:40:31.489 --> 01:40:33.582
-I agree completely, sir.
-Good.

01:40:35.994 --> 01:40:37.655
But I think that one man
should be you.

01:40:39.664 --> 01:40:41.154
And don't worry.
I'll play my part.

01:40:41.199 --> 01:40:42.689
But at the end of the trial...

01:40:42.734 --> 01:40:45.202
you're going to tap
your little gavel.

01:40:45.236 --> 01:40:46.260
You're going to stand up...

01:40:46.304 --> 01:40:47.896
and you're going to confess to
the murder.

01:40:47.939 --> 01:40:49.372
Your duty demands that.

01:40:49.407 --> 01:40:50.533
Fuck you, Hart.

01:40:50.575 --> 01:40:53.009
What the fuck would you know
about duty?

01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:57.477
I'll see you in court, sir.

01:41:19.470 --> 01:41:20.698
I got a better question.

01:41:20.738 --> 01:41:22.501
What was in that goddamn soup
last night?

01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:24.337
I got 20 men
with food poisoning.

01:41:36.587 --> 01:41:39.078
Colonel? Whoa! Colonel!

01:41:40.758 --> 01:41:42.282
You're in no shape
for the trial, sir.

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.985
I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.

01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:46.854
Here we go.

01:41:47.999 --> 01:41:50.263
We'll convene as scheduled
after the appell.

01:41:51.169 --> 01:41:52.193
Square 'em up.

01:41:54.338 --> 01:41:57.569
Prisoners, attention!

01:42:01.913 --> 01:42:03.141
New order, gentlemen.

01:42:03.181 --> 01:42:04.205
Captain Sisk...

01:42:05.683 --> 01:42:09.050
is the prosecution ready
to present its summation?

01:42:09.087 --> 01:42:10.111
We are, Your Honor.

01:42:11.322 --> 01:42:12.346
Very well.

01:42:23.468 --> 01:42:24.594
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

01:42:24.635 --> 01:42:27.832
The court needs a 5-minute
recess before summations.

01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:31.232
Colonel. Colonel!

01:42:31.275 --> 01:42:33.402
Colonel? Colonel!

01:42:33.444 --> 01:42:35.605
Let's get him back
to the barracks.

01:42:35.646 --> 01:42:36.738
Get his coat.

01:42:36.781 --> 01:42:38.305
Get some rest, sir.

01:42:38.349 --> 01:42:41.785
All right, come on.
Get back to the barracks.

01:42:41.819 --> 01:42:43.650
We need an extension, Colonel.
He's very ill.

01:42:44.655 --> 01:42:46.247
The agreement was
the end of the week.

01:42:46.290 --> 01:42:47.780
It's a matter of courtesy,
Colonel.

01:42:47.825 --> 01:42:49.793
The agreement was today!

01:42:54.999 --> 01:42:56.023
I need to talk to you.

01:43:12.183 --> 01:43:13.844
Are you any good at poker,
Lincoln?

01:43:15.786 --> 01:43:18.448
There's an escape going to take
place later on this afternoon.

01:43:19.757 --> 01:43:21.588
Escape? How's that?

01:43:23.261 --> 01:43:26.253
Down a tunnel through
that burned theater wing.

01:43:27.532 --> 01:43:30.126
while the jury's
in deliberation.

01:43:33.905 --> 01:43:36.066
So what you mean?
This whole thing's been a joke?

01:43:36.107 --> 01:43:38.166
Yes.

01:43:38.209 --> 01:43:41.372
But Archer and Bedford
are dead for real.

01:43:41.412 --> 01:43:43.505
Is that part
of this big joke, too?

01:43:43.548 --> 01:43:46.108
Look, we haven't got time now.

01:43:46.150 --> 01:43:48.277
During deliberations you're
going out under the wire...

01:43:48.319 --> 01:43:50.583
with 35 other men.

01:43:50.621 --> 01:43:52.680
Is McNamara, too?

01:43:54.058 --> 01:43:56.492
Yeah, McNamara, too.

01:44:00.264 --> 01:44:03.495
It's funny.
I was just writing my son...

01:44:03.534 --> 01:44:06.002
and in the letter I was
trying to explain to him...

01:44:06.037 --> 01:44:09.768
what the word honor means.

01:44:11.509 --> 01:44:13.704
It would be a hell of a thing,
wouldn't it...

01:44:13.744 --> 01:44:17.111
to find out that your father
helped 35 men...

01:44:17.148 --> 01:44:19.048
escape from a place
like this, wouldn't it?

01:44:19.083 --> 01:44:22.052
You're going out, too, Lincoln.
You got that?

01:44:23.454 --> 01:44:25.547
I can't do that, Tommy.

01:44:26.991 --> 01:44:29.789
Suppose the board comes back...

01:44:29.827 --> 01:44:32.523
and there's nobody sitting in
the defendant's chair anymore.

01:44:32.563 --> 01:44:33.860
It doesn't matter.
You'll already be out.

01:44:33.898 --> 01:44:35.923
Then the search begins...

01:44:35.967 --> 01:44:39.300
and all those men,
they won't have a chance.

01:44:39.337 --> 01:44:41.328
Lincoln, if you stay,
you'll be convicted.

01:44:41.372 --> 01:44:44.918
If I stay, those men
are gonna have a chance.

01:44:44.918 --> 01:44:45.680
If I stay, those men
are gonna have a chance.

01:44:45.719 --> 01:44:47.653
And you'll be executed.

01:44:52.993 --> 01:44:54.392
Lincoln, listen to me, please.

01:44:54.428 --> 01:44:57.329
Everything's fine, Tommy.

01:44:57.364 --> 01:44:59.127
Everything's really OK...

01:45:02.336 --> 01:45:05.499
just as long as he knows
what happened here.

01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:09.408
As long as there's
somebody to tell him.

01:45:16.150 --> 01:45:18.345
How far could I get anyway?

01:45:18.385 --> 01:45:22.116
A colored man running through
the German countryside?

01:45:22.156 --> 01:45:24.021
It'd be target practice.

01:45:49.783 --> 01:45:51.808
It started with a noble idea.

01:45:53.787 --> 01:45:56.221
Letting colored men
join the fight.

01:45:57.624 --> 01:46:00.752
But no one in the Air Corps ever
considered what might happen...

01:46:00.794 --> 01:46:03.820
if one of those Tuskegee men
ever got shot down.

01:46:05.098 --> 01:46:06.998
No one ever asked
what would happen...

01:46:07.034 --> 01:46:09.468
if a colored officer
was suddenly captured...

01:46:09.503 --> 01:46:12.028
and sent to a stalag
like this one.

01:46:13.207 --> 01:46:18.668
But Lincoln Scott was shot down
and he was sent to a stalag...

01:46:18.712 --> 01:46:20.942
and once here,
he wasn't just thrown in...

01:46:20.981 --> 01:46:24.508
amongst white enlisted men,
he was quartered with them.

01:46:24.551 --> 01:46:26.917
Men like Staff Sergeant
Vic Bedford.

01:46:26.954 --> 01:46:30.856
Bedford, the real Bedford,
was a man unknown to us.

01:46:30.891 --> 01:46:35.851
Hateful, vengeful, with
a bigotry that ran bone-deep.

01:46:37.564 --> 01:46:40.124
A man who simply couldn't
stomach the thought...

01:46:40.167 --> 01:46:43.762
of sharing a roof
with colored officers.

01:46:43.804 --> 01:46:46.068
So he badgered Scott,
baited him.

01:46:46.106 --> 01:46:49.075
Even refused
to respect Scott's rank.

01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:53.739
Then conspired to kill the only
friend Scott had in this camp.

01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:56.248
That's why Scott
followed Bedford out...

01:46:56.283 --> 01:46:57.648
the night in question...

01:46:57.684 --> 01:47:01.586
crept up behind him
and snapped his neck.

01:47:02.923 --> 01:47:04.720
Members of the board,
we take no pleasure...

01:47:04.758 --> 01:47:07.226
in prosecuting
Lieutenant Scott...

01:47:07.261 --> 01:47:09.058
but a capital charge requires...

01:47:09.096 --> 01:47:12.190
that we put aside
our passions and sympathies...

01:47:12.232 --> 01:47:16.168
wedding ourselves
solely to the truth.

01:47:16.203 --> 01:47:17.830
It is this.

01:47:17.871 --> 01:47:19.668
Lieutenant Scott
was positively...

01:47:19.706 --> 01:47:22.231
and unimpeachably identified
at the scene of the crime.

01:47:22.276 --> 01:47:25.211
He had motive,
he had opportunity...

01:47:25.245 --> 01:47:27.236
and he had an animus
for the victim...

01:47:27.281 --> 01:47:30.250
which was confirmed
even by his own testimony.

01:47:32.252 --> 01:47:37.121
Lincoln Scott is an officer,
he is a soldier...

01:47:37.157 --> 01:47:38.784
but he is also a murderer.

01:48:05.185 --> 01:48:08.882
There's a tenet that was
drummed into all of us...

01:48:08.922 --> 01:48:10.719
from our first day in basic.

01:48:11.858 --> 01:48:14.053
Sometimes 1 man
must be sacrificed...

01:48:14.094 --> 01:48:16.426
for the good
of the men around him.

01:48:16.463 --> 01:48:18.954
Someone has to be first
to hit the beach...

01:48:18.999 --> 01:48:23.129
or to jump on a grenade
or to draw enemy fire...

01:48:23.170 --> 01:48:25.934
so coordinates can be drawn
for mortar teams.

01:48:25.973 --> 01:48:28.737
Vic Bedford
learned that tenet, too...

01:48:28.775 --> 01:48:31.107
except Vic got it backwards.

01:48:31.144 --> 01:48:33.635
Vic thought that sometimes
a few hundred...

01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:35.841
must be sacrificed
for the good of 1.

01:48:37.317 --> 01:48:39.581
Him. For Vic.

01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:41.815
The watchword was expediency.

01:48:41.855 --> 01:48:43.720
One day he'd trade
with our captors...

01:48:43.757 --> 01:48:46.248
to get hard-to-find parts
for a radio...

01:48:46.293 --> 01:48:48.352
earning him the loyalty
of our commanding officer...

01:48:48.395 --> 01:48:49.760
and his staff.

01:48:49.796 --> 01:48:52.162
Then Vic would tell the Germans
where to find that radio...

01:48:52.199 --> 01:48:53.359
Go.

01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:55.630
in exchange for the murder
of Lamar Archer.

01:48:57.804 --> 01:48:59.863
The army has its share
of cowards...

01:49:02.009 --> 01:49:03.909
and Vic Bedford was one of them.

01:49:03.944 --> 01:49:08.074
It also has heroes...
soldiers like Lincoln Scott.

01:49:08.115 --> 01:49:11.278
Lincoln Scott who wanted nothing
more than to serve his country.

01:49:11.318 --> 01:49:12.945
And serve he did.

01:49:12.986 --> 01:49:16.080
Nine downed German fighters,
30 missions...

01:49:16.123 --> 01:49:20.253
until one of those missions
landed him here, Stalag 6A...

01:49:20.293 --> 01:49:23.387
where Vic Bedford and the sad
sacks Bedford called friends...

01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:25.193
were lying in wait.

01:49:25.232 --> 01:49:28.633
Scott was a target
from the second he got here.

01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:33.299
He suffered insults, threats,
but he did not retaliate.

01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:37.777
He did not kill Vic Bedford.

01:49:37.811 --> 01:49:39.438
No.

01:49:40.647 --> 01:49:41.807
Someone beat him to it.

01:49:44.451 --> 01:49:47.011
It could've been
any number of people.

01:49:47.054 --> 01:49:50.615
The guard who thought
that Bedford had cheated him.

01:49:50.657 --> 01:49:53.592
A fellow kriegie who discovered
Bedford's treachery.

01:49:53.627 --> 01:49:54.992
Even one of our
ranking officers...

01:49:55.028 --> 01:49:57.053
as punishment for
ratting out that radio.

01:49:57.097 --> 01:49:59.361
So this, then, is our victim?

01:49:59.399 --> 01:50:04.098
A bigot. A traitor. A rat.

01:50:04.137 --> 01:50:06.469
Enemy of every kriegie in camp.

01:50:08.408 --> 01:50:11.935
The question is, who hated him
enough to kill him?

01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:18.149
Colonel.

01:50:26.093 --> 01:50:27.287
I did.

01:50:31.865 --> 01:50:34.060
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

01:50:34.101 --> 01:50:36.194
I killed Vic Bedford, sir.

01:50:38.271 --> 01:50:40.364
Come on, Colonel. Here.

01:50:43.143 --> 01:50:45.873
I want every man in the compound
present...

01:50:45.912 --> 01:50:47.971
for the execution
of Lieutenant Hart.

01:50:50.317 --> 01:50:53.582
Very brave.
Very brave, indeed.

01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:54.712
Colonel, this man has rights.

01:50:54.755 --> 01:50:55.779
Not anymore.

01:50:55.822 --> 01:50:57.414
This court still has to
deliberate the matter.

01:50:57.457 --> 01:50:58.719
I am the court now!

01:50:58.759 --> 01:51:00.522
Now. Get him up.
Get him up. Get him up.

01:51:08.101 --> 01:51:09.659
Get out.

01:53:24.353 --> 01:53:25.820
I want every man...

01:53:25.855 --> 01:53:27.618
who participated
in the court-martial...

01:53:27.656 --> 01:53:29.556
removed from the line.

01:53:34.897 --> 01:53:36.330
Line them up.

01:53:37.033 --> 01:53:38.933
Line them up. Now.

01:53:38.968 --> 01:53:40.868
These men knew nothing, Colonel.

01:53:42.772 --> 01:53:44.239
Line them up!

01:53:46.242 --> 01:53:47.209
You will be the first.

01:53:47.243 --> 01:53:48.574
These men knew nothing.

01:53:48.611 --> 01:53:50.374
You will be the first!

01:53:50.413 --> 01:53:51.880
Colonel, they knew nothing!

01:55:14.430 --> 01:55:18.025
So, your men are saboteurs
as well?

01:55:18.067 --> 01:55:21.264
No, Colonel,
they're just soldiers.

01:55:21.303 --> 01:55:23.328
They were following my orders.

01:55:23.372 --> 01:55:26.500
I assume complete
responsibility.

01:55:29.178 --> 01:55:31.442
That's very noble of you.

01:55:40.890 --> 01:55:44.189
Seems you've won our duel
after all, Colonel.

01:55:46.996 --> 01:55:48.588
No.

01:55:50.666 --> 01:55:53.999
We both lose, don't we?

01:55:56.839 --> 01:55:58.238
Yeah.

01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:06.573
And now you wish to
trade your life for theirs?

01:56:15.491 --> 01:56:17.288
Yes, I do.

01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:52.755
Very well.

01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:26.846
We buried the Colonel in
a marked grave behind the camp.

01:59:26.884 --> 01:59:29.546
Three months later,
the German army surrendered.

01:59:29.586 --> 01:59:32.146
Our stalag was liberated.

01:59:32.189 --> 01:59:34.248
The war was over.

01:59:35.259 --> 01:59:39.787
We returned home to America,
to our families.

01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:41.320
Lincoln Scott got the chance...

01:59:41.365 --> 01:59:44.163
to explain the word honor
to his son.

01:59:44.201 --> 01:59:50.071
Honor and courage,
duty, sacrifice.

01:59:50.107 --> 01:59:53.543
Lincoln's son came
to understand those words...

01:59:53.577 --> 01:59:55.067
and so have I.
