WEBVTT

00:02.392 --> 00:04.142
So...

00:04.144 --> 00:07.045
couldn't help but notice
none of you RSVP'd

00:07.047 --> 00:08.880
to my murder mystery
dinner party.

00:08.882 --> 00:10.165
Oh, yeah.

00:10.167 --> 00:12.317
We were meaning
to do that.

00:12.319 --> 00:13.785
No, you weren't
because it was a week ago

00:13.787 --> 00:15.737
and nobody came!

00:16.823 --> 00:18.707
So, if you want to solve
the mystery of who stabbed

00:18.709 --> 00:20.608
Koothrappali in the back
with the weapon of indifference,

00:20.610 --> 00:22.828
it was all of you.

00:22.830 --> 00:25.113
I don't think that
qualifies as a mystery.

00:25.115 --> 00:27.349
We all knew what
we were doing.

00:28.384 --> 00:30.752
We're sorry, Rajesh.

00:30.754 --> 00:32.337
Maybe we can do it next week.

00:32.339 --> 00:34.473
Whoa, whoa, we're
not that sorry.

00:34.475 --> 00:36.408
Don't worry, I can take a hint.

00:36.410 --> 00:38.460
No more murder mystery parties.

00:38.462 --> 00:39.945
Great. Thank you.
Hallelujah.

00:39.947 --> 00:41.813
Because I've got something
even better planned.

00:41.815 --> 00:43.565
Aw! Why?
Come on.

00:43.567 --> 00:45.016
Just hear me out.

00:45.018 --> 00:46.251
I'm going to make you guys

00:46.253 --> 00:48.804
a scavenger hunt
like they have at M.I.T.

00:48.806 --> 00:50.322
Oh...

00:50.324 --> 00:51.323
I loved those.

00:51.325 --> 00:52.758
I did them every year there.

00:52.760 --> 00:53.875
We did them at Princeton, too.

00:53.877 --> 00:54.826
Oh, that's cute.

00:54.828 --> 00:56.495
Like it's a real college.

00:57.830 --> 01:00.048
That's amusing-- I was going
to say that about M.I.T.,

01:00.050 --> 01:02.451
but it works for Princeton, too.

01:03.986 --> 01:05.771
Scavenger hunts at Harvard
were really tough.

01:05.773 --> 01:07.773
I always got stuck on
the first challenge--

01:07.775 --> 01:09.558
trying to find someone
to be on a team with me.

01:11.845 --> 01:14.863
I guess that story's
more sad than funny.

01:16.916 --> 01:17.966
I love scavenger hunts.

01:17.968 --> 01:19.267
My friends and I had them
all the time.

01:19.269 --> 01:20.668
Oh, these are a
little different.

01:20.670 --> 01:22.971
There's a tradition
at elite universities.

01:22.973 --> 01:24.523
And Princeton.

01:24.525 --> 01:26.842
A tradition of hunts

01:26.844 --> 01:28.894
full of puzzles
that rely on logic

01:28.896 --> 01:31.679
and obscure knowledge, science.

01:31.681 --> 01:33.815
Oh, in ours we would just run
around town looking for a store

01:33.817 --> 01:36.151
that would sell us beer.

01:37.453 --> 01:38.370
So, uh, who's in?

01:38.372 --> 01:40.639
I think it sounds fun.
Yeah, me, too.

01:40.641 --> 01:41.873
I'm in.
Let's do it.

01:42.742 --> 01:44.209
I'm sorry.
Are we really doing this

01:44.211 --> 01:45.994
or are we tricking
Koothrappali again

01:45.996 --> 01:47.996

02:19.331 --> 02:21.631
Oh, everything
I could possibly need

02:21.633 --> 02:24.384
to win the scavenger hunt.

02:24.386 --> 02:26.219
You really think he's gonna
send us to a bowling alley?

02:26.221 --> 02:28.488
Well, if he does,

02:28.490 --> 02:30.724
do you know how filthy
those rental balls are?

02:31.943 --> 02:33.260
They might as well
stand on the corner

02:33.262 --> 02:35.479
and give away free rectal exams.

02:39.351 --> 02:40.934
Okay, everybody.

02:40.936 --> 02:43.236
Who's ready for a...

02:44.539 --> 02:47.274
...scavenger
hunt?

03:04.243 --> 03:06.159
Somewhere...

03:06.161 --> 03:08.295
in the city of Pasadena,

03:08.297 --> 03:09.513
I've hidden

03:09.515 --> 03:12.632
a golden coin.

03:12.634 --> 03:13.867
Oh!

03:13.869 --> 03:16.636
You will be faced with a total

03:16.638 --> 03:19.222
of ten puzzles!

03:21.042 --> 03:22.943
Each p...

03:24.613 --> 03:26.630
Each...

03:26.632 --> 03:28.365
each puzzle will lead you

03:28.367 --> 03:30.784
to the location of the next.

03:30.786 --> 03:32.269
The last of which

03:32.271 --> 03:35.822
will lead you to the coin.

03:36.908 --> 03:38.325
The first team that finds it...

03:38.327 --> 03:42.245
wins!

03:43.331 --> 03:45.165
He is a born showman.

03:47.051 --> 03:49.636
Any questions?

03:50.838 --> 03:52.239
Yes, to be fair, do people

03:52.241 --> 03:54.958
who went to Princeton
get a head start?

03:54.960 --> 03:56.476
That's not funny.

03:56.478 --> 03:59.613
Oh, it actually is
if you get the joke.

03:59.615 --> 04:00.814
It's based on the premise

04:00.816 --> 04:03.400
that Princeton isn't
a very good school.

04:03.402 --> 04:04.701
Ha-ha.

04:04.703 --> 04:07.320
Oh, see? Now he gets it.

04:07.322 --> 04:09.322
Okay, guys, go ahead

04:09.324 --> 04:11.324
and divide yourselves
into teams of two.

04:11.326 --> 04:13.093
Should we just do couples?

04:13.095 --> 04:14.110
Couples sounds great.

04:14.112 --> 04:15.745
Or we could mix things up.

04:15.747 --> 04:17.197
Maybe pick names out of a hat.

04:17.199 --> 04:18.398
Whatever.

04:18.399 --> 04:19.366
Whoa, whoa...

04:19.368 --> 04:21.618
whoa.

04:21.620 --> 04:22.752
Why don't you just admit

04:22.754 --> 04:24.621
you don't want to be
on a team with me.

04:24.623 --> 04:26.773
I just said,
"Couples sound great."

04:26.775 --> 04:28.575
Mm-hmm, yeah, you don't
think I'm smart enough.

04:28.577 --> 04:30.427
You think I'm gonna
be a liability.

04:30.429 --> 04:31.761
Even though I
totally just used

04:31.763 --> 04:33.079
the word "liability"
correctly

04:33.081 --> 04:36.016
in a sentence.

04:36.018 --> 04:38.552
Yeah.

04:38.554 --> 04:39.886
All right,
let's-let's do couples.

04:39.888 --> 04:40.971
I want to.

04:40.973 --> 04:42.022
No, no.

04:42.024 --> 04:43.390
Let's mix things up.

04:43.392 --> 04:45.625
I choose Sheldon,
and we're gonna kick your ass!

04:45.627 --> 04:47.727
Yeah... really?

04:47.729 --> 04:49.563
The only time I'm ever
picked first for a team

04:49.565 --> 04:52.032
and I'm stuck
with the liability?

04:53.618 --> 04:55.768
Stop that.
Penny is not a liability.

04:55.770 --> 04:57.737
Thank you. Do you want
to be on my team?

04:57.739 --> 05:00.824
Maybe we pick names
out of a hat.

05:01.942 --> 05:03.710
All right, hurry up
and close the door

05:03.712 --> 05:04.878
so they can't hear us.

05:10.034 --> 05:11.635
Would you stop pouting?
