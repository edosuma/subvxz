WEBVTT

00:03.600 --> 00:06.800
- We need to act on this now.
- Not without a full-risk analysis.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.700
We don't wanna be rushing
into this thing half-cocked.

00:08.700 --> 00:12.300
As opposed to the full-cock
that's been working so well for us?

00:12.300 --> 00:14.200
You got something you wanna say?

00:14.200 --> 00:18.200
Just don't wanna lose another baby
with the bathwater, boss.

00:18.300 --> 00:20.300
Fine. We'll send Spike.

00:20.300 --> 00:22.600
- Bugger that. Do it yourself.
- [Beeping]

00:22.600 --> 00:26.000
Spike, this is a delicate matter that needs
to be handled with a lot of finesse.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.800
- And why the hell are we talking to him?
- Because he signed on to help.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.300
Not to be some
glorified garbage collector.

00:31.300 --> 00:33.300
It's not garbage. It's a body.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.400
There's a bloody gang war coming our way
if we don't get it back.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.700
- Stiff s that important?
- It's the remains of the capo di famiglia...

00:38.700 --> 00:40.900
- of the Goran demon clan.
- Never heard of him.

00:40.900 --> 00:44.200
That's 'cause the capo was human tolerant.
Kept a low profile.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.700
- More interested in profit than mayhem.
- What happened to him?

00:46.700 --> 00:49.900
Died on a business trip in Italy.
We need to go there, retrieve his body...

00:49.900 --> 00:54.200
and return it to his family in the next...
[Inhales] ooh, 26 hours.

00:54.200 --> 00:56.600
- Or what? He gets deader?
- No, he stays dead.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.900
They die, they pupate, they live again.

00:58.900 --> 01:01.600
But only if the proper rituals are performed
by the immediate family.

01:01.600 --> 01:05.200
If the capo's body isn't returned in time,
the rituals won't take.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.100
So long, capo.
Hello, power vacuum.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.000
Which the rival clans
will try to fill.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.800
And they aren't
as tolerant of humans.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.200
<i>If we do this,</i>
<i>it all stays cool. If not...</i>

01:13.200 --> 01:15.300
- We'll stick with do. Okay, come on.
- Hey, hey.

01:15.300 --> 01:17.600
- Pack your bags.
- I don't even speak the language.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.100
- We'll get you a book.
- How do you say "wank off' in Italian?

01:21.100 --> 01:24.300
- Can somebody please just get on a plane?
- What?

01:24.300 --> 01:26.500
When?

01:27.800 --> 01:33.000
Yeah. I understand. Thanks.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.500
<i>All right. What is it this time?</i>

01:35.500 --> 01:39.200
Übervamps? Demon gods?
Devil robots?

01:42.200 --> 01:44.400
It's Buffy.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074

02:37.500 --> 02:40.700
- I said, I'll take care of it.
- Take care of what?

02:40.700 --> 02:42.600
- Is Buffy all right?
- She will be when I get there.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.600
What happened?
What happened.

02:44.600 --> 02:50.000
- The Immortal.
- The who?

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
- The foulest evil hell ever vomited forth.
- Worse than you?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.300
- He was spotted in Rome near Buffy's...
- Wait a minute.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.500
Rome? That's were the capo died.

02:58.500 --> 03:01.200
- That's definitely his M.O.
- The capo's?

03:01.200 --> 03:04.400
The Immortal. He whacks
the capo, lures me to Rome.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.900
Takes out a Slayer
and a vampire with a soul.

03:06.900 --> 03:11.400
Plus, he starts a war when the capo's body
isn't returned for resurrection. This guy's good.

03:11.400 --> 03:15.300
So am I. Harmony, have the jet
fueled, ready for takeoff.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.700
- Do you really think we can take him?
- Whoa. What do you mean "we"?

03:17.700 --> 03:20.100
You don't think I'm gonna let you traipse off
to Italy without me, do you?

03:20.100 --> 03:22.200
- You don't speak the language.
- I'll get a book.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.600
- Spike, you're only going to make things worse.
- Oh.

03:24.600 --> 03:28.100
Look, we get the capo's body, we rescue Buffy,
we stop the Immortal. It's that simple.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.400
- Unless he kills you, which would be sad.
- He's not gonna kill me.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.200
Not if I'm with ya.

03:34.100 --> 03:37.800
Admit it. You think you're gonna ride in,
save the day and sweep Buffy off of her...

03:37.800 --> 03:40.400
- Like you're not thinking the same thing.
- I'm already seeing somebody.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.900
- What, dog girl?
- Nina's a werewolf.

03:42.900 --> 03:46.000
Fido know her boyfriend's flying halfway
around the world to visit his ex?

03:46.000 --> 03:49.400
Look, I was gonna call her, and we're just
hanging out. She's not my girlfriend.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.200
- This rate, never will be.
- Doesn't concern you, Spike.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.800
I just wanna see you happy.

03:54.800 --> 03:58.600
Well, not too happy, 'cause then
I'd have to stake ya.

03:58.600 --> 04:01.500
- Second thought, have at it.
- This isn't about us.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.300
- You and Nina?
- Me and you.

04:03.300 --> 04:05.600
<i>This is a dangerous mission</i>
<i>that's only gonna get worse...</i>

04:05.600 --> 04:08.000
if we don't put aside our differences.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.400
We have to work together on this
to stop the Immortal and save Buffy.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.400
[Exhales]

04:13.400 --> 04:15.900
Oh, and pick up
that demon body thingy.

04:15.900 --> 04:20.200
- Partners then?
- Just like old times.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.400
- You want a drink?
- God, yes.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.800
Huh. Really can't
get drunk off these things.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.000
Not us anyway.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.400
Vampire constitution.
Not always a plus.

04:39.200 --> 04:42.400
- How'd you know?
- Drank a lot of them and I still don't like you.

04:42.400 --> 04:46.100
- About Buffy. How did you know
she was in trouble?
- I got word.

04:46.100 --> 04:47.900
- From who?
- A source.

04:47.900 --> 04:52.300
- You've been spying on her?
- I just wanted to make sure she was all right.

04:52.300 --> 04:55.200
Sending your lackeys to do your stalking
for you. That is really pathetic.

04:55.200 --> 05:00.000
All right, fine. I'm not proud of it,
but it's... it's Buffy.

05:02.100 --> 05:05.300
How many you got on her?

05:05.300 --> 05:08.400
Just the one. But he got spotted.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.900
Called me from the hospital
after he regained consciousness.

05:11.900 --> 05:15.000
- You should've had more
of your people watching her.
- Yeah.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.700
- We'll be landing soon.
- [Sighs]

05:20.700 --> 05:24.100
- You remember the last time we were in Italy?
- Like it were yesterday.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.700
<i>- Ciao.</i>
<i>- Ciao.</i>
<i>- Ciao.</i>

05:27.700 --> 05:31.400
<i>- Ciao.</i>
- Wait a minute. I wasn't in Italy in the '50s.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.400
Oh, right. Guess you weren't.
Really missed out.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.600
Guess so. Sounds a lot better
than when I remember it.

05:37.600 --> 05:42.200
- 1894?
- The room of pain.

05:42.200 --> 05:45.000
<i>[Chains Rattling]</i>

05:56.600 --> 05:58.800
[Grunts]

06:00.400 --> 06:03.800
- William. [Grunts]
- Ow. Bloody hell.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.100
That right bastard.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.100
The Immortal thinks
he can do this to us.

06:14.100 --> 06:16.900
- He doesn't know who he's dealing with.
- [Rattling]

06:16.900 --> 06:19.600
He's about to find out.
[Loud Grunt]

06:19.600 --> 06:21.900
He's gonna curse the day
he ever crossed purpose with Angelus.

06:21.900 --> 06:24.400
- And William the Bloody.
- [Both Grunt]

06:24.400 --> 06:26.500
We'll see how immortal he is
when we're done with him.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.000
We'll carve him up
like a Sunday roast...

06:29.000 --> 06:33.700
and make him watch as we feast
on his steaming flesh. [Straining]

06:34.900 --> 06:37.300
[Exhales]

06:39.000 --> 06:41.400
- How are you doing?
- Bugger.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.200
[Growls]

06:44.200 --> 06:47.500
Your master sent you to do his dirty work.
Ferry us to hell then.

06:47.500 --> 06:51.500
We'll save a spot for him next to the fire
and the mangy, dung-lick...

06:53.500 --> 06:56.700
- A bit over the top there?
- His benevolence, the Immortal...

06:56.700 --> 07:01.800
wishes to convey his regrets
at having detained you.

07:01.800 --> 07:07.600
But your recent actions against
his concerns merited stiff reprimand.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.800
- His concerns?
- This is our city. We were here first.

07:10.800 --> 07:15.500
No, actually, he was. Three hundred
years ago, and now he's back.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.600
You will leave the city tonight
and never return...

07:18.600 --> 07:22.200
under a penalty of death so swift...

07:23.300 --> 07:25.100
Go ahead, take your best shot.

07:25.100 --> 07:28.100
I'll snatch your little wee sticks out of
the air and spend the next fortnight...

07:28.100 --> 07:30.900
shoving 'em slowly up your arse.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.400
- [Both Snickering]
- Can you really do that?

07:35.400 --> 07:37.800
The arrow thing?
I don't know. Never tried.

07:37.800 --> 07:41.100
Aw, look what he did to me shirt.

07:41.100 --> 07:44.700
- His benevolence, the Immortal.
- In for a shock he is.

07:44.700 --> 07:49.100
There's going to be a reckoning after a
good meal and a long rest in the arms of...

07:49.100 --> 07:52.800
- Darla.
<i>- What have they done to her?</i>

08:02.000 --> 08:04.700
I can no longer hear
the song of the green.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.500
You think that includes me?

08:09.900 --> 08:12.500
Her powers have been greatly reduced.

08:12.500 --> 08:14.600
She still has
an unusual level of strength...

08:14.600 --> 08:17.100
but it's no longer invulnerable or
able to alter time.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.500
You revel in my defeat.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.400
Is that how you view it?
You've been defeated?

08:22.400 --> 08:26.200
My world gone.
My powers stripped.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.500
How would you define it?

08:28.500 --> 08:32.000
Uh, how about, lucky we didn't kill you
when you went nuclear?

08:32.000 --> 08:36.400
This fate is worse than death.

08:36.400 --> 08:41.000
Condemned to live out existence in a vessel
incapable of sustaining my true glory.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.800
How am I to function
with such limitation?

08:45.800 --> 08:48.200
Have you ever tried a Sea Breeze?

08:48.200 --> 08:51.500
You attempt amusement
at the expense of your better.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.600
Illyria, perhaps
you should return to the lab.

08:54.600 --> 08:58.900
- I do not bend to your wishes.
- I'm not asking you to.

08:58.900 --> 09:03.300
Merely suggesting that more tests might lead
to knowledge of how to help you function.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.900
I go because it suits me.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.900
[Exhales]

09:15.900 --> 09:21.100
Too bad that whirly-jig thing didn't
suck the sass out of her.

09:22.700 --> 09:25.800
She's overcompensating. Posturing.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.600
So she really wasn't
going to snap my stalk?

09:27.600 --> 09:31.600
Her powers are weakened,
but she's still unpredictable.

09:31.600 --> 09:34.200
Perhaps more so
until she learns to adjust.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.900
- We have to be careful not to agitate her.
- Burkles.

09:39.200 --> 09:43.100
- See? I told you they would remember us.
- Guess we do make an impression.

09:43.100 --> 09:45.800
Why are you here?
I mean, what...

09:45.800 --> 09:48.400
- Hawaii.
- Been saving up for years.

09:48.400 --> 09:52.700
Thought we'd take a layover and surprise
Fred. Uh, know where we can find her?

09:55.800 --> 09:58.000
Step into my office.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.700
- Let me handle this.
- Bet you'd like to.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.700
Spike? Oh, <i>mio Dio.</i>

10:21.700 --> 10:24.000
[Continues In Italian]

10:24.000 --> 10:27.300
- What are you doing here?
- About to ask you the same question, Andrew.

10:27.300 --> 10:32.300
Buffy and Dawn are letting me crash. My casa
was incinerated when that thing happened.

10:32.300 --> 10:35.500
- What thing?
- [Chuckles] Cultural misunderstanding.

10:35.500 --> 10:39.000
Let us speak of more pleasant times.
[Continues In Italian]

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
I part my threshold.
I mean, my apartment...

10:43.000 --> 10:44.900
obviously.

10:50.300 --> 10:52.800
So, um, I had plans
later this evening...

10:52.800 --> 10:55.000
<i>but I could change them</i>
<i>if you guys wanna hang.</i>

10:56.500 --> 10:59.900
<i>I could show you Rome at night.</i>
<i>A city of contrasts.</i>

10:59.900 --> 11:03.200
- Anywhere you wanna go.
Anything you wanna see.
- [Together] Buffy.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.200
Right, because you two both...

11:06.200 --> 11:09.500
- Yeah. She's not here.
- Where'd she go?

11:09.500 --> 11:11.800
- To meet the Immortal.
- By herself?

11:11.800 --> 11:14.700
- I told you I had plans.
- When did she leave?

11:14.700 --> 11:17.200
- Just missed her.
- Then we're not too late.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.200
- Of course, it could be worse.
<i>- You're telling me.</i>

11:19.200 --> 11:21.500
Most nights,
they never leave the house.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.600
Just curl up on the couch and snuggle.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.500
- They're snuggling?
- For starters.

11:32.100 --> 11:35.700
Wait. Uh, you didn't know
they were together?

11:35.700 --> 11:38.700
It's worse.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.300
Darla. Darla. Darla.

11:49.300 --> 11:52.500
- What have they done? My sweet death.
- [Sighs]

11:52.500 --> 11:55.700
Angelus, you're back.

11:55.700 --> 11:58.700
I'd claw my way back from the depths
of hell to lay by your side.

12:01.100 --> 12:04.600
- [Spits] He's tasted you.
- Who?

12:04.600 --> 12:08.400
- Who do you think?
- Oh, that cheeky bastard.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.300
<i>Had us tossed,</i>
<i>then violates your woman.</i>

12:10.300 --> 12:14.100
- Did he hurt you?
- Not until I asked him to.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.500
Oh, come on. Have you seen him?

12:20.500 --> 12:24.200
With the eyes and the chest...

12:24.200 --> 12:26.100
and the immortality.

12:26.100 --> 12:29.200
- We're immortal.
- Not like him.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.100
I mean, he's not some
common vampire. He's...

12:32.100 --> 12:34.500
I don't know what he is. A giant.

12:34.500 --> 12:38.800
A titan straddling good
and evil serving no master...

12:38.800 --> 12:41.700
but his own considerable desires.

12:41.700 --> 12:44.300
- Darla.
<i>- And spiritual.</i>

12:44.300 --> 12:47.700
Did you know he spent 150 years
at a Tibetan monastery?

12:47.700 --> 12:50.300
Which I guess explains all the desire.

12:50.300 --> 12:53.300
- He's my arch nemesis.
- Oh, darling.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.900
It was just fornication.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.300
Really great fornication.

13:00.300 --> 13:02.600
- She's glowing, mate.
- She isn't.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.600
- Little bit.
- Best fit you for a pair of antlers.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.800
- Been made the right cuckold, you have.
- Time for another pony ride?

13:12.100 --> 13:15.100
Son of a bitch!

13:15.100 --> 13:17.700
- The both of you?
- He is insatiable.

13:17.700 --> 13:20.800
Drusilla, you let him touch you?

13:20.800 --> 13:25.200
- He felt like sunshine.
- No. No.

13:25.200 --> 13:28.100
- That's why he had us tossed.
So he could violate...
- He didn't...

13:28.100 --> 13:31.100
- Violate our women!
- Violate in succession!

13:31.100 --> 13:33.400
- Concurrently.
- Concurrently?

13:33.400 --> 13:35.800
You never let us do that.

13:35.800 --> 13:41.600
Come on, Dru. Let's have a bath
so the boys can weep in private.

13:41.600 --> 13:45.200
- Will you hold me under the water?
- If you wish.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.800
Mmm.
[Giggles]

13:50.500 --> 13:52.500
This is a slight that will not go unmet.

13:52.500 --> 13:56.800
- Death's too quick.
- Not all deaths are quick.

13:56.800 --> 14:00.300
- What do you have in mind?
- I think it's time the Immortal
found out who he's dealing with.

14:00.300 --> 14:03.400
I think it's time for blood vengeance.

14:03.400 --> 14:06.000
Blood vengeance.
Look, I'm sure we're on the list.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Is there anything under blood vengeance?

14:09.700 --> 14:12.800
<i>No. No blood vengeance. Sorry.</i>

14:12.800 --> 14:16.500
- Maybe it's under Angelus.
- You are not on the Immortal's list.

14:16.500 --> 14:19.200
You know what?
To hell with the list.

14:20.800 --> 14:24.100
You're not in here.
You're not going in there. Piss off!

14:24.100 --> 14:26.400
He mocks us at every turn.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.900
The man has no sense of indecency.
You remember Frankfurt?

14:29.900 --> 14:33.800
He hatches the Rathruhn egg personally
and then just decides
to give those nuns safe passage.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.600
- Those were <i>my</i> nuns.
- Yeah, nuns are your thing.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.900
Everybody knows that.
They respect it. They respect us.

14:39.900 --> 14:44.600
We are the reason men fear the night.
This isn't over yet, Immortal! This'll never be over!

14:44.600 --> 14:48.300
It's over... just like that.

14:51.400 --> 14:55.300
- Not that I thought I had a chance anyway.
- At least I have a girlfriend.

14:55.300 --> 14:59.100
- Still.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

15:00.800 --> 15:02.600
- The Immortal?
- I mean, come on.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.000
- She's smarter than that.
- She'd never fall for a centuries-old guy...

15:05.000 --> 15:08.300
with a dark past who may
or may not be evil.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.300
- She's under some kind of spell.
- I was thinking that.

15:12.300 --> 15:14.300
We're gonna pick up the capo's body...

15:14.300 --> 15:16.400
Find the Immortal
and break his whammy.

15:21.700 --> 15:23.800
<i>Grazie, Signor Angelo.</i>

15:23.800 --> 15:27.500
We are in your debt for
attending to a delicate matter.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.700
<i>Grazie. Grazie.</i>

15:29.700 --> 15:34.900
Um, this is the, uh, capo di famiglia of
the Goran demon clan?

15:34.900 --> 15:37.800
Sí, sí. The capo di famiglia.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.200
- Must have been a wee fella.
<i>- [Zipper Unzips]</i>

15:41.900 --> 15:46.400
- This is just his head.
- Sí, sí. The head of capo di famiglia.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.800
What happened to the rest of him?

15:48.800 --> 15:51.400
When a Goran demon becomes
heavy with the age...

15:51.400 --> 15:55.100
his head sag and drop off like a ripe fig.

15:55.100 --> 15:58.000
- So a new body just hatches out of this?
<i>- If the rituals...</i>

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
are performed by the family in time.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.500
You must get the head of
the capo to Los Angeles <i>subito,</i> eh?

16:05.500 --> 16:07.000
- Sí?
<i>- Sí. Subito.</i>

16:09.600 --> 16:12.500
- Is Buffy home yet?
- You guys, it's only 8:30.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.600
- Right.
- Yeah.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.200
Do you know where they went?

16:17.800 --> 16:21.000
Gotta say, this is a step up from where
you boys used to hang your hats.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
- Ooh, a couple of steps.
- Yes.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.500
<i>- We...</i>
- Uh, you know, we didn't wanna say anything...

16:27.500 --> 16:30.700
- but we were a little worried about that old hotel.
- Seemed a little rundown.

16:30.700 --> 16:33.000
But Fred called it home,
so we just kept our mouths shut.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.200
A girl reaches a certain age, she's earned
the right to make her own decisions.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.000
- Which with Fred was around seven, wasn't it?
<i>- [Both Chuckle]</i>

16:39.000 --> 16:42.100
- Mr. And Mrs. Burkle.
- Roger and Trish.

16:42.100 --> 16:45.500
The way she goes on about y'all, well,
it feels like we're practically family.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.500
<i>So, where's our prodigal daughter?</i>

16:47.500 --> 16:49.600
Out saving the world
with that nice Angel fella?

16:49.600 --> 16:54.600
Roger. Trish. There's something
you need to know. Fred...

<i>Well, there she is now.</i>

<i>- Sí, sí.</i> I love the English.

- We'll get along fine then.
- We're looking for a girl. American.

- Blonde hair, blue eyes?
- Many blonde American coeducationals.

17:35.300 --> 17:38.000
Spring break. The girls, they go wild.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.100
No, no. We're looking for a friend of ours.

17:41.100 --> 17:44.100
She's in trouble.
This, uh, ponce called the Immortal...

17:44.100 --> 17:49.100
Ah, <i>sí, sí.</i> The Immortal's new <i>regala.</i>

17:49.100 --> 17:51.000
<i>They come while ago.</i>

17:51.000 --> 17:53.100

18:03.400 --> 18:06.400
Your friend maybe go
a little wild too <i>. Sí?</i>

18:06.400 --> 18:10.400
Right. Hold down the fort.
I'll be right back.

18:10.600 --> 18:13.200
[Scoffs]
Oh, yeah. Here it comes.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.400
The part where you run off alone, play
the big hero, so Buffy'll take you back.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.900
Well, news flash, Blondie Bear,
never gonna happen.

18:18.900 --> 18:22.100
Look, I know I don't have a shot with her,
all right? Probably never did.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.500
<i>But I still care about her,</i>
<i>and I'm not gonna let her...</i>

18:24.500 --> 18:27.300
end up with a jerk like
the Immortal or you.

18:27.300 --> 18:31.000
- Ours is a forever love.
- I had a relationship with her too.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.900
Okay, sleeping together
is not a relationship.

18:32.900 --> 18:34.600
It is if you do it enough times.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.600
Spike. The head.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.900
I thought you had it.

Where do you think
you're going with our head, Jeeves?

18:47.900 --> 18:50.600
<i>Anywhere he wants.</i>

18:54.100 --> 18:57.200

Where'd the little guy go?

Hang on to the head. That's it.

- You were right there too.
- I wasn't in charge of the head.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.800
Well, it's gone now, isn't it?

21:43.800 --> 21:46.300
You gonna stand here in the <i>strada,</i>

21:46.300 --> 21:50.100
- Did you just say <i>strada?</i>
- It means street.

21:50.400 --> 21:54.100
Yeah, I know what it means.

21:54.100 --> 21:57.900
Look. We only have 12 hours
to get that head back...

21:57.900 --> 22:00.200
before Los Angeles becomes
a demon war zone.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.200
Shall we argue some more,
or shall we get on with it?

22:02.200 --> 22:05.300
All right. You know, you're right.
No more screwing around.

22:05.300 --> 22:08.700
We find that guy, get the head back, then we
get the hell out of here. That's it.

22:08.700 --> 22:11.900
- Have you seen the blonde girl?
- Buffy. Her name is Buffy.

22:11.900 --> 22:13.900
- She was dancing with the Immortal.
- Did they leave?

22:13.900 --> 22:16.400
- Relax, relax. It's okay.
- They're still here?

22:16.400 --> 22:19.100
Oh, no. They're gone.
But you must relax.

22:19.100 --> 22:23.000
- I pour you some wine.
- He's got her, Spike. He's got Buffy.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.100
- Why is this always happening to us?
- It's him. The Immortal.

22:26.100 --> 22:30.000
This is what he does. Every time
he shows up, I either lose my girl...

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
get beaten by an angry mob,
or get thrown in prison for tax evasion.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.600
- Long story.
- Well, you know what? It's different now.

22:36.600 --> 22:39.400

- Hey. Damn right we are.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.900
- We're not gonna be his Shemps anymore.
- No way, man.

22:41.900 --> 22:43.900
We're just out of our element here.

If this was L.A.,
we'd have him hog-tied by now.

27:00.700 --> 27:02.800
Look, don't you guys have, like,
an Italian Wesley here?

27:02.800 --> 27:05.500
Yes, yes. We have.
But he's taking a nap...

27:05.500 --> 27:09.200
and I do not need him to tell me what is
already widely known.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.800
That the Immortal does not use magic.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.800
Then it must be something else.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.100
We need to know everything
there is to know about him. We need...

27:16.100 --> 27:18.700
To keep your head.
[Laughs] Yes.

27:18.700 --> 27:22.700
We know all about your mission to retrieve
the capo di famiglia.

27:22.800 --> 27:26.000
<i>And I have to say, right now,</i>
<i>it seems a bit more important...</i>

27:26.000 --> 27:28.500
than trying to pry your friend
off of the Immortal.

27:28.500 --> 27:32.300
<i>Your head is in great danger.</i>

27:32.300 --> 27:36.300
We have already received a ransom note.
It was addressed to you via our offices.

27:36.300 --> 27:38.100
I took the liberty of sneaking a peek.

27:40.100 --> 27:43.400
<i>We must hurry because the drop is about to</i>
<i>take place in less than one hour.</i>

27:43.400 --> 27:46.100
All right. We're gonna need
a chase helicopter, an assault team...

27:46.100 --> 27:48.500
And guns. Lots and lots of guns.

27:48.500 --> 27:53.800
No, no, no, no. No, no.
The two of you are so precious, but no.

27:53.800 --> 27:57.700
This is a civilized country.
We do these things all the time.

27:57.700 --> 28:00.200
Somebody gets kidnapped.
Somebody pays the money.

28:00.200 --> 28:03.500
Everybody goes home happy.
<i>Grazie. Prego.</i> Kiss, kiss.

28:03.500 --> 28:06.100
<i>We already have the money</i>
<i>ready to go.</i>

28:06.100 --> 28:08.300
<i>Eh? Huh?</i>

28:08.300 --> 28:11.100
- [Sighs]
- All right. Fine.

28:11.100 --> 28:15.900
<i>- Whatever. We'll do it your way.</i>
- Who's making the drop?

28:19.700 --> 28:22.300
- I helped save the world, you know.
- Like I haven't.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.600
- Yeah. But I've done it a lot more.
- Oh, please.

28:24.600 --> 28:27.100
- Closed the Hellmouth.
- I've done that.

28:27.100 --> 28:29.000
[Scoffs]
You wore a necklace.

28:30.300 --> 28:33.000
You know, I helped kill
the mayor, and, uh, Jasmine.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.100
Do those really count
as saving the world?

28:36.100 --> 28:38.300
I stopped Acathla.
That saved the world.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.700
Buffy ran you through with a sword.

28:40.700 --> 28:42.600
Yeah, but I made her do it.

28:45.100 --> 28:47.300
I signaled her with my eyes.

28:47.300 --> 28:52.800
She killed you. I helped her.
That one counts as mine.

28:52.800 --> 28:56.200
My point is, I'm better than this, okay?
We're better than this.

28:56.200 --> 28:59.100
What the hell could Buffy see in him?

28:59.100 --> 29:03.400
Perhaps she likes the cut of his trousers.

29:11.400 --> 29:14.400
Sorry to just drop in
on you like this unannounced.

29:14.400 --> 29:17.700
Are you kidding me?
I'm just sad y'all can't stay longer.

29:17.700 --> 29:19.900
- Well, the beach is calling.
- Wesley...

29:19.900 --> 29:23.800
- you take care of our little Fred for us, okay?
- Of course.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.100
Ah.

29:27.900 --> 29:31.100
I miss you already,
and we haven't even gone yet.

29:31.100 --> 29:35.900
[Exhales] Are you sure you're okay?
You seem different somehow.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.700
<i>Aw, she's just growing up, Mother.</i>

29:37.700 --> 29:40.300
Let her go. You're gonna embarrass her
in front of her employees.

29:40.300 --> 29:43.500
Stop it, Daddy.
Come here and give me a hug.

29:43.500 --> 29:46.800
- I love you guys so much.
- [Trish] Oh, we love you too.

29:46.800 --> 29:50.800
- We'll talk soon, okay?
- Countin' on it.

30:00.100 --> 30:03.500
Did you get what you needed
from that experience?

30:03.500 --> 30:07.800
[As Illyria]
Yes. It was most informative.

30:08.900 --> 30:11.700
Good. Don't ever do it again.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.700
<i>You must be so lonely.</i>

30:18.700 --> 30:22.100
Your girlfriend has become
lovers with the Immortal.

30:22.100 --> 30:24.600
How unfortunate for you.

30:24.600 --> 30:28.500
And how fortunate for her.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.700
- You know the Immortal?
- But, of course.

30:30.700 --> 30:33.100
[Scoffs] I knew it.
None of this is a coincidence.

30:33.100 --> 30:37.500
It's been his plan all along. Steal our head,
keep us busy and traipse off with my girl.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.600
<i>- Our</i> girl.
- It's a setup.

30:39.600 --> 30:42.200
- You're just his lackey.
- I should be so lucky.

30:42.200 --> 30:46.700
The Immortal does not need
a man like me to do his business.

30:46.700 --> 30:49.100
He is a wild card.

30:49.100 --> 30:51.700
A wolf removed from the pack.

30:51.700 --> 30:54.300
A stallion without, uh, the bridle.

30:54.300 --> 30:57.600
- What, are you in love with him?
- No, no, no, no.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.700
Well, yeah, okay. Yes.
But, uh, if anything...

31:00.700 --> 31:03.500
he's more of an inspiration.

31:03.500 --> 31:06.800
A spiritual guide.
Have you read his book?

31:07.900 --> 31:10.000
It's a life-changer.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.300
- [Quietly] I'm getting a little tired of Italy.
- Know what you mean.

31:14.300 --> 31:19.400
Oh, look. The Americans are relying on
violence to solve their problems.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.100
What a surprise.

31:24.800 --> 31:28.000
[Shouting In Italian]

31:31.000 --> 31:33.600
Okay. No more games.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.300
[Groans]

31:35.300 --> 31:37.700
One more step
and the head gets it, eh?

31:37.700 --> 31:40.100
<i>We are not animals.</i>

31:40.100 --> 31:42.900
We are <i>Italiano.</i>

31:42.900 --> 31:46.900
You give us the money,
we give you the head.

31:50.100 --> 31:52.500
You give us the money,
we give you the head.

31:54.200 --> 31:57.600
The money, the head.
The money...

31:57.600 --> 32:00.800
Yeah. We get it.
The money.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.000
Hey.

32:11.400 --> 32:13.400
<i>Arrivederci, Americanos.</i>

32:13.400 --> 32:17.900
It was a pleasure to do
the business with you.

32:17.900 --> 32:20.300
[Men Laughing, Chattering]

32:20.300 --> 32:24.100
Don't believe him for a second.
The Immortal's neck-deep in all of this.

32:24.100 --> 32:26.100
Of course he is. He's screwing us.

32:26.100 --> 32:28.200
He screwed us before
and he's screwing us now.

32:28.200 --> 32:30.700
Yeah. Every time we hear
his bleeding name...

32:30.700 --> 32:33.500
we end up standing in
the <i>strada</i> holding the bag.

32:34.600 --> 32:37.300
[Beeping]

32:47.500 --> 32:50.700
[Spike Exhales]
Civilized country...

32:50.700 --> 32:52.800
Look what that squeaker did to my jacket.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.400
After everything we've been through,
you're pissed about a jacket.

32:55.400 --> 32:59.400
Not <i>a</i> jacket, my jacket. You have no idea
what I went through to get this.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.300
You stripped it off
the body of a dead Slayer.

33:01.300 --> 33:03.500
Which gives it
great sentimental value.

33:03.500 --> 33:07.100
Besides, I've been wearing it
for over 30 years. It's like a part of me.

33:07.100 --> 33:10.700
Get over it. Buy a new one.

33:10.700 --> 33:14.100
It's my second skin. It's who I am.

33:14.100 --> 33:17.600
It's just one more thing he's taken away
that I'll never get back.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.700
Yeah. This is good.

33:19.700 --> 33:23.600
I'm glad you like because I sent another 10
of them to Los Angeles for you...

33:23.600 --> 33:28.000
along with a fine assortment of shoes.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.300
[Gasps]
[Italian]

33:33.600 --> 33:36.400
You look <i>gorgeous.</i> Oh!

33:37.900 --> 33:40.000
- I'm not sure this is me.
- No, no, no, no, no.

33:40.000 --> 33:45.700
This is the latest style.
You will define handsome for years to come.

33:45.700 --> 33:49.600
Now, what happened to the drop?
No <i>grazie, prego,</i> kiss, kiss?

33:49.600 --> 33:51.900
<i>Grazie. Prego.</i> Kaboom.

33:51.900 --> 33:55.600
Oh, they always do this
to first-timers in this country.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.800
- Did I not mention that?
- You know what? That's it.

33:57.800 --> 34:00.000
- Call up the helicopters.
- And the assault team.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
- We're getting our head back.
- No, no, no. I love the two of you so much...

34:04.000 --> 34:07.800
<i>but brute force will only get</i>
<i>your precious head smooshed.</i>

34:08.100 --> 34:11.400
You have done such
fine, quality work.

34:11.400 --> 34:15.800
Now, please, relax.
Let us handle it from here.

34:15.800 --> 34:18.100
Sometimes you have to
put your faith in a higher power.

34:18.100 --> 34:20.500
We're heroes. We don't need
any higher power.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.600
- I'll be in touch.
- We make our own fate!

34:22.600 --> 34:27.199
We don't need anybody cleaning up
our mess, you know. We're champions!

34:29.300 --> 34:32.600
Got this under control.

34:32.600 --> 34:35.300
Yeah, we're just gonna... We're...

34:35.300 --> 34:38.100
[Sighs]
Shall we just go home?

34:38.100 --> 34:41.600
[Exhales]
Oh, God, yes.

34:41.600 --> 34:44.900
Couldn't get me out of this rat hole
of a country fast enough.

34:44.900 --> 34:48.699
- Is Buffy back yet?
- Sorry. Not yet.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.800
<i>You guys can hang if you want.</i>
<i>I'm just heading out.</i>

34:55.800 --> 34:59.100
<i>Oh. Hey, nicejacket.</i>

34:59.100 --> 35:02.500
- It's the latest style.
- Andrew...

35:04.600 --> 35:09.500
Has Buffy been acting off?
Like the Immortal's got her under a spell of sorts?

35:09.500 --> 35:11.900
Excellent question. No.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.500
- Could it be mind control?
- Or a love potion?

35:15.500 --> 35:19.200
- Did she drink a love potion?
<i>- Dude, seriously, I thought of all those things...</i>

35:19.200 --> 35:24.600
<i>but, it turns out, Buffy fell for the Immortal</i>
<i>on her own, and now she's happy, that's it.</i>

35:24.600 --> 35:27.200
But she's not finished baking yet.
I gotta wait till she's done baking.

35:27.200 --> 35:30.000
You know, till she finds herself.
'Cause that's the drill. Fine.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.300
I'm waiting patiently, and meanwhile,
the Immortal's eating cookie dough.

35:33.300 --> 35:37.000
<i>Uh, Spike, is Angel crying?</i>

35:37.000 --> 35:39.700
No.

35:39.700 --> 35:43.000
- Not yet.
<i>- May wanna hold the waterworks, big guy.</i>

35:43.000 --> 35:46.400
<i>The Immortal's cool and all,</i>
<i>but he ain't all that. He's got his flaws.</i>

35:46.400 --> 35:49.100
- Really?
- Wh-What are they?

35:49.100 --> 35:52.200
<i>[Sighs]</i>
<i>The point is, she's moving on.</i>

35:52.200 --> 35:56.200
<i>You guys do the same.</i>
<i>You might catch her one day.</i>

35:56.200 --> 35:58.000
<i>One of you anyway.</i>

35:58.000 --> 36:00.900
<i>But you keep running in place,</i>
<i>you're gonna find she's long gone.</i>

36:03.500 --> 36:06.000
It is a bit silly.

36:08.300 --> 36:12.100
Us, chasing her around
like a couple of henpecked teenagers.

36:14.900 --> 36:19.600
<i>Buffy loves both of you,</i>
<i>but she's gotta live her life. People change.</i>

36:22.000 --> 36:24.400
You guys should try it sometime.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.900
<i>[Knocking]</i>

36:33.000 --> 36:35.800
[Italian]

36:37.000 --> 36:39.700
[Continues In Italian]

36:42.900 --> 36:45.000
<i>Ciao.</i>

36:49.200 --> 36:53.200
- Well, maybe it's time we...
- Yeah.

37:09.900 --> 37:12.000
[As Fred]
Wes?

37:14.200 --> 37:17.500
- Are you, like, mad at me or something?
- Stop it.

37:18.700 --> 37:21.300
[As Illyria]
Isn't it what you desire?

37:21.300 --> 37:26.100
<i>[As Fred] I mean, you love me. I love you.</i>
<i>What's the big deal?</i>

37:26.100 --> 37:28.300
I loved <i>her.</i>

37:29.300 --> 37:31.800
[As Illyria]
You loved this.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.800
And part of you still does.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.700
<i>I can feel it in you.</i>

37:43.200 --> 37:46.800
I... wish to explore it further.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.600
Never.

37:48.600 --> 37:53.100
You, like this.

37:53.100 --> 37:54.700
It sickens me.

37:56.200 --> 37:59.400
[As Fred]
Oh, Lord. We both know that ain't true.

37:59.400 --> 38:02.200
Stop it.

38:03.400 --> 38:07.400
Change back. Be blue. Be anything.

38:07.400 --> 38:09.700
Don't be her.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.400
Don't ever be her.

38:21.100 --> 38:23.500
As you wish.

38:25.600 --> 38:29.900
- Thanks.
<i>- [Bell Dings]</i>

38:29.900 --> 38:33.300
Gunn, we lost the head.
Start preparing the troops for war.

38:33.300 --> 38:36.100
- Head's in your office.
- What?

38:36.100 --> 38:38.100
It's on your desk.

38:52.400 --> 38:55.700
"With regards, the Immortal."

38:57.400 --> 39:00.600
You know, I really hate that guy!

39:00.600 --> 39:03.600
What's Buffy thinking? Honestly?

39:03.600 --> 39:06.700
She doesn't exactly have
the best taste in men. Case in point.

39:06.700 --> 39:09.200
Hey. I think I turned out all right.

39:09.200 --> 39:11.600
Yeah. Once she got through with you.

39:11.600 --> 39:15.500
I wasn't the one living in alleys,
rubbing rat filth all over my face.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.600
If we're talking projects,
you're the Sistine Chapel.

39:17.600 --> 39:19.600
- I wasn't a project.
- Well, neither was I.

39:22.600 --> 39:25.800
Can't we just
lock her away in a box...

39:25.800 --> 39:29.100
where no one can ever touch her,
you know, like we did with Pavayne?

39:31.500 --> 39:34.100
I don't think she'd let us.
I mean, she's pretty strong.

39:34.100 --> 39:37.600
We could do a spell,
some sort of mind control.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.800
Oh, she'd figure it out.
She's pretty smart.

39:41.900 --> 39:45.500
[Quietly] Yeah.
[Scoffs]

39:45.500 --> 39:49.300
So, what? We just
have to live with it?

39:49.600 --> 39:53.300
- Get on with our lives?
- Fraid so.

39:53.300 --> 39:57.300
[Forced Exhale]
Fine. No problem.

39:57.400 --> 40:00.000
I was planning on
doing that anyway.

40:00.000 --> 40:04.300
- Yeah? Me too.
- Actually, I'm doing it right now, as we speak.

40:04.300 --> 40:06.700
- I'm moving on.
- Moving on.

40:06.700 --> 40:08.000
- Oh, yeah.
- Right now.
