00:01.037 --> 00:03.215
Previously on Harrow...

00:03.250 --> 00:05.580
Section sampled and ready for analysis

00:05.616 --> 00:07.055
first thing tomorrow morning.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.655
You don't look too happy about that.

00:08.690 --> 00:12.415
"Didn't Daniel resign?
Isn't he going to Bora Bora?"

00:12.450 --> 00:14.975
"No, Harrow changed his mind."

00:15.010 --> 00:16.775
I don't love anything more than you.

00:16.810 --> 00:19.655
I still so much want
to go away with you.

00:19.690 --> 00:21.549
Still want to get that drink?

00:23.210 --> 00:24.735
You took too long to answer.

00:24.770 --> 00:26.215
You're screwed.

00:26.250 --> 00:27.655
What do you mean?

00:27.690 --> 00:29.735
You're under her spell.

00:29.803 --> 00:33.330
Were you ever tempted?
-To falsify evidence?

00:34.555 --> 00:35.996
What did you do?

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:29.693 --> 01:31.975
Yeah, Skyla's gone, I'm afraid.

01:32.010 --> 01:34.055
I know, we're all pretty blue about it.

01:34.090 --> 01:36.290
The old girl was one of
the first in the study.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.875
Well, the vehicle did
run right over her,

01:39.911 --> 01:41.415
but I'll let you know for sure.

01:41.450 --> 01:44.690
Alright, poor old girl. Let's
see what you've been eating.

01:47.050 --> 01:48.541
And, voila.

01:48.685 --> 01:50.530
One crocodile stomach.

01:51.010 --> 01:52.575
Eugh.

02:38.010 --> 02:39.655
Hello, Jack Twine's room.

02:39.690 --> 02:41.815
Hi. It's Dan Harrow.

02:41.850 --> 02:43.415
Hi, Dan.

02:43.450 --> 02:47.175
Sorry to call so early. I was hoping
to catch Jack. Can you put him on?

02:47.210 --> 02:49.215
Jack's just in the shower at the moment.

02:49.250 --> 02:51.575
Do you want me to take a message?

02:51.610 --> 02:54.015
No, thanks. That's OK.

02:54.050 --> 02:56.448
Um, I'll... I'll call again.

02:56.484 --> 02:58.403
No worries. Bye-bye.

03:00.980 --> 03:02.530
Thanks, love.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.473
_

03:48.320 --> 03:50.091
_

03:52.134 --> 03:54.047
_

03:55.540 --> 03:57.815
Hey. Who the hell are you?

03:57.850 --> 03:59.375
You're the prick who's been squatting.

03:59.410 --> 04:01.130
Funny story about that.

04:15.170 --> 04:16.815
Casual Tuesdays?

04:16.850 --> 04:19.454
All in on a pair of shoes?
-Threw 'em at a council worker.

04:19.490 --> 04:21.649
That only happened once.

04:23.565 --> 04:25.935
Is that the DNA profile of the bones?

04:25.970 --> 04:27.735
Yeah. I ran it through the database.

04:27.770 --> 04:29.135
And?

04:29.170 --> 04:30.450
No match.

04:31.970 --> 04:34.455
And your divers? Any sign of the skull?

04:34.490 --> 04:36.215
No, they're still searching.

04:36.250 --> 04:38.695
So, in the meantime, it's back
to the Missing Persons database,

04:38.730 --> 04:41.375
which means that I need
a really accurate idea

04:41.410 --> 04:42.895
of how long he's been in the river.

04:42.930 --> 04:44.375
Six to twelve months.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.175
And Lyle kindly volunteered to help.

04:46.210 --> 04:47.935
How could you not want
to help this woman?

04:47.970 --> 04:51.015
Sweet. But help is only
helpful when you're right.

04:51.050 --> 04:53.855
Meaning?
-No, no, no, you're the expert.

04:53.890 --> 04:55.435
What do you think?

04:55.730 --> 04:58.185
I think the bones have been in
the water for at least two years,

04:58.221 --> 04:59.494
probably longer.

04:59.530 --> 05:03.015
Well, I can see how a novice
might jump to that conclusion,

05:03.050 --> 05:06.175
but aquatic immersion
in sub-tropic waters

05:06.210 --> 05:07.895
often accelerates degradation

05:07.930 --> 05:10.815
and leads to an overestimation
of post-mortem duration,

05:10.850 --> 05:14.415
particularly with the incursion
of biota in the bone cavities,

05:14.450 --> 05:17.215
like, sabatieria.

05:17.532 --> 05:18.895
Worms.

05:20.490 --> 05:24.655
But with regard to the sabatieria,
of Nematoda Comesomatidae,

05:24.690 --> 05:27.335
I'm sure you've taken into consideration

05:27.370 --> 05:29.095
that their life cycle
changes dramatically

05:29.130 --> 05:30.535
when they're in that part of the river

05:30.570 --> 05:32.455
where salt and freshwater comingle.

05:32.861 --> 05:36.775
Then their reproductive cycle
is retarded by up to 300%,

05:36.810 --> 05:38.735
viz Alsop and Paterson, 2005,

05:38.770 --> 05:42.799
rendering any comparison
to normal sabatieria life cycles

05:43.170 --> 05:44.650
completely unreliable.

05:47.011 --> 05:48.770
Health and safety.

05:52.130 --> 05:54.135
Anyway, so, 24 to 48 months?

05:54.170 --> 05:56.775
OK.

05:56.810 --> 05:58.335
And you'll keep removing those?

05:58.370 --> 06:00.290
"How could you not want
to help this woman?"

06:03.895 --> 06:06.020
Hey, do I really need to
read Alsop and Paterson?

06:06.056 --> 06:09.135
Who? What? Whatever for?

06:09.170 --> 06:10.374
You two?

06:12.610 --> 06:14.455
Why the Fukushima precautions?

06:14.490 --> 06:16.335
Because the Parks and Wildlife
officer who found this

06:16.370 --> 06:18.255
ended up in a North Queensland hospital.

06:18.290 --> 06:19.615
With?

06:19.650 --> 06:21.692
Coughing, vomiting, nausea.

06:21.728 --> 06:23.568
Exactly how I feel about
North Queensland.

06:27.690 --> 06:28.816
Daniel.

06:33.410 --> 06:35.345
Smells a bit like garlic.

06:36.343 --> 06:39.479
Right arm of an adult Caucasian male.

06:39.515 --> 06:42.535
Elbow to wrist...
-28 centimetres.

06:42.570 --> 06:46.655
Massive trauma to the skin, tissue
and tendon at the elbow joint.

06:46.690 --> 06:49.655
Consistent with being
ripped off by a crocodile.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.661
I hate lizards.

06:51.697 --> 06:53.226
Sorry?
-Nothing.

06:53.570 --> 06:57.375
Epidermis and dermis quite decomposed,

06:57.410 --> 06:58.895
so we're not gonna get any prints.

06:58.930 --> 07:00.215
So, how long dead?

07:00.250 --> 07:04.135
Likely dead a couple of days,
before the croc ate his arm.

07:04.170 --> 07:07.090
Then it's been sitting in
reptilian stomach acid.

07:08.209 --> 07:09.750
Can you smell that?

07:10.389 --> 07:11.772
Do I have to?

07:13.279 --> 07:14.839
Jesus.

07:15.850 --> 07:17.415
Does it smell of garlic?

07:17.450 --> 07:19.335
Yeah, amongst other things.

07:19.370 --> 07:21.575
You see, I can't think of
any enterobacteriaceae

07:21.610 --> 07:23.095
that gives off the smell of garlic.

07:23.130 --> 07:25.015
So, what do you think knocked
over that Parks officer?

07:25.050 --> 07:28.530
I don't know.
-Bacteria, spores or something else?

07:30.130 --> 07:31.410
What have you found?

07:32.323 --> 07:34.168
That cut's too neat.

07:34.624 --> 07:36.424
Crocodile teeth didn't do that.

07:37.410 --> 07:38.895
Murder?

07:38.930 --> 07:40.415
No. Well, maybe.

07:40.450 --> 07:42.095
I didn't say that.

07:42.130 --> 07:43.648
So, what's your theory?

07:44.228 --> 07:47.335
Someone cut away a tattoo post-mortem

07:47.370 --> 07:49.095
because it was a unique identifier?

07:49.130 --> 07:51.255
Or peri-mortem, for the same reason,

07:51.290 --> 07:54.295
or while the man was still
alive, as a form of torture,

07:54.330 --> 07:58.415
or he did it to himself, as
a radical act of self-harm.

07:58.450 --> 07:59.855
I don't know.

07:59.890 --> 08:02.095
It's impossible to say
without seeing the body.

08:03.370 --> 08:05.055
Funny you should mention that.

08:05.090 --> 08:06.655
I can't go to North Queensland.

08:06.690 --> 08:09.455
There still might be some tissue
in the crocodile's belly.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.695
Why can't Elston do it?
It's his jurisdiction.

08:11.730 --> 08:14.455
Elston's busy with a bus
rollover south of Cairns.

08:14.490 --> 08:15.935
Why can't Fairley go?

08:15.970 --> 08:19.055
He's preparing a presentation
for the RCPA Conference.

08:19.090 --> 08:22.535
Why can't you go? Get back on
tools? Hands dirty again, yeah?

08:22.570 --> 08:24.255
It's Fern's 18th on Friday.

08:24.290 --> 08:26.935
So, she's accepting your calls, is she?

08:26.970 --> 08:28.016
No.

08:28.051 --> 08:31.339
Well, is Steph organising a party?

08:31.730 --> 08:33.255
Not exactly, no, but...

08:33.289 --> 08:34.855
Have you even bought a present?

08:34.890 --> 08:36.414
That I have done.
-OK.

08:36.450 --> 08:38.414
I understand you want
to be there with her,

08:38.450 --> 08:40.775
but there is a dead guy
up there somewhere

08:40.809 --> 08:42.691
who might have people missing him too.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.615
Cheer up, Daniel.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.855
It's the tropics. And
give Kiriakos a call.

08:48.890 --> 08:50.855
Scenes of Crime want
to send someone too.

08:50.890 --> 08:52.970
Probably that Soroya Dass.

08:55.130 --> 08:58.095
As you know, there's
been another round of cuts,

08:58.415 --> 09:01.095
and it means that at the end of term,

09:01.130 --> 09:04.130
we have to review our staffing numbers.

09:04.970 --> 09:06.530
Sorry, everyone.

09:08.610 --> 09:10.330
It won't be you.

09:11.130 --> 09:12.895
You look worried. It won't be you.

09:13.130 --> 09:15.130
It'll most likely be the new guy.

09:16.370 --> 09:18.015
You're the Phys Ed teacher.

09:18.050 --> 09:19.695
Jesse Walsh.

09:19.730 --> 09:21.815
Stephanie... Tolson. Steph.

09:21.850 --> 09:25.935
And there's only one PE teacher
and five Year 2/3 teachers,

09:25.970 --> 09:30.270
so I'm putting my money on
axing the... part-time one.

09:49.370 --> 09:51.655
How awesome is getting
out of the office?

09:51.690 --> 09:53.335
So awesome.

09:53.370 --> 09:55.255
How awesome is this sunshine?

09:55.290 --> 09:56.955
Awesome.

09:58.690 --> 10:00.730
North Queensland's awesome.
-_

10:01.589 --> 10:02.831
Hey, sorry.

10:02.867 --> 10:04.442
That's alright. I'll
meet you over there.

10:05.034 --> 10:06.239
Hi.

10:06.275 --> 10:07.879
What happened?

10:07.915 --> 10:09.732
I'm gonna need some context.

10:09.768 --> 10:12.495
With Fern. I just got a text from her
saying that she needs to see me

10:12.530 --> 10:14.533
and not to give you her new number.

10:14.569 --> 10:16.053
I did like you asked.

10:16.089 --> 10:18.900
I went to Lewison. I tracked her down.

10:18.936 --> 10:20.415
But she's smart. She dumped her phone.

10:20.450 --> 10:22.215
Sounds like she's got a new one.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.215
Where are you?
-Airlie Beach.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.010
Work.
-Who with?

10:27.210 --> 10:28.735
Nichols.

10:28.770 --> 10:30.704
Brian. Lucky you.

10:30.740 --> 10:32.105
When are you back?

10:32.252 --> 10:34.535
I'll try and get back
for Fern's birthday.

10:34.570 --> 10:36.295
Just in case.

10:36.330 --> 10:37.490
I gotta go.

10:40.130 --> 10:42.495
So, are we catching a cab?

10:42.530 --> 10:44.770
Local sergeant's meant
to be picking us up.

10:46.490 --> 10:48.930
10 bucks says that's our guy.

10:55.610 --> 10:58.415
Need a moment?
-I think I need more than a moment.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.055
Double or quits he's an idiot.

11:00.090 --> 11:01.216
Sergeant Dass?

11:01.251 --> 11:02.895
Hi.
-Gabriel Capello.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.815
And this must be Doctor Harrow.

11:04.850 --> 11:06.255
Huge admirer.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.535
We once had an electrocution
up here, so I read your paper

11:08.570 --> 11:11.695
on clots resulting from sudden
fluid build-up in the interstitium.

11:11.730 --> 11:13.048
It was fascinating.

11:13.530 --> 11:14.650
Anyway...

11:18.966 --> 11:21.236
How was the flight?
-Awesome.

11:38.358 --> 11:40.497
Who'd you have to kill
to get transferred here?

11:40.533 --> 11:42.618
Not a transfer. Born and bred.

11:42.654 --> 11:45.015
Tell you what, it's the first
time we've ever had anyone

11:45.050 --> 11:46.735
taken by a crocodile.

11:46.770 --> 11:48.958
Any locals missing?
-None reported.

11:48.994 --> 11:51.239
Why didn't I see any
boats out on the water?

11:51.275 --> 11:53.655
Read your report. Tattoo
excised from the victim's arm.

11:53.690 --> 11:56.032
Sounded like foul play, so
we locked down the harbour.

11:56.068 --> 11:58.175
As you can imagine,
everyone's furious with me.

11:58.210 --> 11:59.850
Hey, Detective.

12:05.410 --> 12:06.975
It's not gonna bite, you know?

12:07.010 --> 12:08.495
I hate lizards.

12:08.530 --> 12:11.610
Sorry?
-I love new experiences.

12:23.730 --> 12:25.975
What's the worst thing
you've ever smelt?

12:26.010 --> 12:28.090
My sister's three-cheese pasta.

12:29.370 --> 12:30.895
I didn't know you had a sister.

12:33.630 --> 12:35.585
New front-runner.

12:37.449 --> 12:39.827
You gonna... examine the intestine?

12:39.863 --> 12:41.423
Yeah.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.130
Do you mind giving me a hand?

12:57.970 --> 12:59.779
How long has this animal been dead?

12:59.815 --> 13:02.055
Less than 24 hours.

13:02.090 --> 13:04.490
This looks like it's
been decaying a week.

13:05.730 --> 13:07.335
What would accelerate that?

13:07.811 --> 13:10.255
Some rat poisons do.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.095
I remember dissecting some rats

13:12.130 --> 13:14.175
that had been given
anticoagulant poison.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.935
It literally broke down
their organs into liquid.

13:16.970 --> 13:19.735
You think the croc ate poisoned rats?

13:19.770 --> 13:22.330
There's no sign of rats in here.

13:24.926 --> 13:26.566
But this...

13:28.890 --> 13:32.695
This looks like traces of
human digestive tract.

13:32.730 --> 13:35.015
So, before it ate the victim's forearm,

13:35.050 --> 13:37.295
maybe it took a bite out of his stomach?

13:38.770 --> 13:40.730
I'll take some samples.

13:41.890 --> 13:45.010
Only question is, where's
the rest of our victim?

13:46.890 --> 13:48.695
I don't know,

13:48.730 --> 13:51.370
but this GPS tracker might tell us.

13:56.092 --> 13:58.810
Sergeant Dass has a few
questions. How you feeling?

13:59.930 --> 14:01.735
A bit woozy.

14:02.345 --> 14:05.375
We only found one arm and some
stomach tissue in the animal.

14:05.410 --> 14:08.255
We think the rest of the victim
might be in the croc's meat safe.

14:08.766 --> 14:10.246
Could well be.

14:10.691 --> 14:12.251
Here, I'll show you.

14:13.355 --> 14:14.800
There you go.

14:15.010 --> 14:19.335
So, these are Skyla's movements
for the past couple of months,

14:19.370 --> 14:22.255
ending in front of Ida and Ewan's place.

14:22.290 --> 14:24.615
You can see she roams pretty wide.

14:24.650 --> 14:26.695
That's up to 90 clicks out to sea.

14:26.730 --> 14:28.575
Is that her meat safe there?

14:28.610 --> 14:29.935
I'd say so.

14:29.970 --> 14:33.010
I could take you there, but the
doctors won't even let me go home.

14:33.965 --> 14:36.175
That's too bad. <i>C'est la vie.</i>

14:36.210 --> 14:38.010
No, we have to go.

14:39.010 --> 14:41.135
Bruce could take em.
-Bruce?

14:41.170 --> 14:42.535
No, no.

14:42.570 --> 14:44.090
Bruce'll eat 'em alive.

14:45.490 --> 14:47.935
You pretty bitches.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.775
You behave, Millicent Bruce.

14:49.810 --> 14:52.095
And you too, good luck.

14:52.130 --> 14:54.570
Come on, come aboard.

15:03.530 --> 15:05.250
First time croc-hunting?

15:06.250 --> 15:08.495
Yeah.
-Virgins. Ho-ho.

15:08.530 --> 15:10.050
Not for long.

15:15.650 --> 15:17.415
You OK?

15:17.450 --> 15:19.055
Yeah. Great.

15:19.090 --> 15:20.216
Now...
-Good.

15:20.251 --> 15:22.850
Do you know how crocodiles mate?

15:24.370 --> 15:26.255
No, I've never given it
a moment's thought.

15:26.290 --> 15:27.535
Well...

15:27.570 --> 15:31.895
they're very sensual creatures
and highly attentive lovers.

15:32.343 --> 15:34.975
And their courtship is most erotic.

15:35.667 --> 15:39.175
The male crocodile slides
his long, hard body

15:39.210 --> 15:43.415
up against the sinuous
flanks of the female,

15:43.450 --> 15:47.815
and rhythmically arouses
her until she's ready,

15:47.850 --> 15:51.255
and then they plunge
underwater and penetrate...

15:51.290 --> 15:55.490
..again and again and again.

15:56.844 --> 15:58.810
Here we are.

16:02.330 --> 16:04.015
That's Skylar's meat safe.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.375
Any uneaten food she'd
have stowed in there.

16:06.410 --> 16:08.375
So, how do we get it out?

16:08.410 --> 16:10.650
We don't. You wade in and fetch it.

16:12.090 --> 16:13.690
You've gotta be kidding.

16:14.154 --> 16:16.159
Aren't these waters a little...

16:16.370 --> 16:18.295
crowded?

16:18.330 --> 16:19.955
That tends to scatter 'em.

16:22.650 --> 16:25.415
Of course, they soon come back.

16:25.450 --> 16:27.535
I reckon you've got about five minutes.

16:27.914 --> 16:29.735
Well, why can't you go in?

16:30.238 --> 16:31.958
I'm lookout.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.890
I'm not doing this on my own.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.655
I hate lizards.

17:01.690 --> 17:04.650
Yeah, I figured.

17:05.770 --> 17:08.494
Well, he's not here, so let's go.

17:08.530 --> 17:11.175
No, no, not until we
have a good look around.

17:11.551 --> 17:14.369
Sometimes they store
their food in the banks.

17:24.050 --> 17:25.775
Find something?

17:26.109 --> 17:27.829
Can you give me a hand?

17:34.890 --> 17:35.976
Wait.

17:36.011 --> 17:38.010
Got something?
-What's this?

17:41.330 --> 17:42.895
What is it?

17:42.930 --> 17:44.655
I don't know.

17:44.690 --> 17:47.135
OK. That's enough of that for one day.

17:47.170 --> 17:48.495
Shall we go?
-Wait...

17:48.530 --> 17:50.175
Now, come on, just keep looking.

17:50.210 --> 17:54.655
Listen, there's nothing here
but weeds and leaves and...

17:54.690 --> 17:57.175
Shit.

17:57.210 --> 18:00.090
Good. You found him.

18:14.809 --> 18:17.164
Hey, bub. How are you?
-Did you bring it?

18:21.650 --> 18:24.050
What do you need your
birth certificate for?

18:26.985 --> 18:29.495
He's handsome.

18:29.530 --> 18:32.415
What's his name.
-Callan.

18:32.450 --> 18:34.375
And what does he do?

18:34.410 --> 18:36.495
Don't worry, Mum, I'm not thinking about

18:36.530 --> 18:38.855
marrying the first handsome guy I meet.

18:38.890 --> 18:40.695
Or the second.

18:40.730 --> 18:42.970
OK. Sorry.

18:43.915 --> 18:45.575
Listen, it's your birthday on Friday...

18:45.610 --> 18:46.586
Mum.

18:46.611 --> 18:48.175
...and I thought you might like dinner.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.135
I'll make you a chocolate caramel cake.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.055
Your father's away.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.335
Where?
-Up north.

18:54.370 --> 18:55.935
Work.

18:55.970 --> 18:58.375
So, it'll just be you and me.

18:58.410 --> 19:01.730
And... Callan, if you like.

19:05.190 --> 19:06.930
I'll think about it.

19:19.050 --> 19:21.055
Right forearm's missing.

19:21.090 --> 19:23.495
So is most of his stomach.

19:28.130 --> 19:30.250
His face is badly bloated.

19:33.488 --> 19:35.008
My goodness.

19:35.890 --> 19:37.895
Did you get it?

19:38.192 --> 19:39.786
What is it?

19:40.718 --> 19:43.198
A colorimetric gas detector.

19:45.730 --> 19:50.135
Crystals in the tube change colour
when it detects particular gases.

19:50.170 --> 19:54.050
This one turns red if it finds...

19:56.567 --> 19:58.287
..phosphine.

19:59.363 --> 20:01.088
He was poisoned.

20:01.290 --> 20:03.455
How do you get phosphine poisoning?

20:03.490 --> 20:05.055
By eating zinc phosphide.

20:05.090 --> 20:06.535
That's a pesticide.

20:06.570 --> 20:08.855
My uncle uses it to kill
rats around his cane farm.

20:08.890 --> 20:12.375
Yes, it hits the stomach acid
and releases phosphine gas,

20:12.410 --> 20:14.130
which is extremely toxic.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.455
So, this guy ate rat poison...
-And it killed him.

20:17.490 --> 20:20.015
And then the crocodile ate
his arm and his stomach.

20:20.129 --> 20:21.289
And killed him too.

20:22.410 --> 20:23.855
Best guess, how long dead?

20:24.183 --> 20:25.820
Five, seven days.

20:27.210 --> 20:28.895
What are you thinking?

20:28.930 --> 20:31.665
Skylar's GPS tracker showed
that she went out to sea.

20:31.701 --> 20:33.735
I want to know if there are
any boats in this port

20:33.770 --> 20:35.330
that crossed her path.

20:36.770 --> 20:38.528
I've checked with the Coast Guard.

20:38.970 --> 20:41.208
There are three, and this
is the first of them.

20:41.450 --> 20:43.175
Hello, the boat.

20:43.210 --> 20:45.455
You'd be here about the dead man.

20:45.961 --> 20:48.255
Yeah, it's a small harbour.
You can't keep secrets.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.575
You need to see the manifest?
-Yeah.

20:50.610 --> 20:52.215
We sailed here from...

20:52.250 --> 20:54.055
...where were we last, angel?

20:54.090 --> 20:56.055
Norfolk.
-Norfolk Island.

20:56.090 --> 20:57.655
And before that, New Caledonia.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.095
And before that, Fiji.

20:59.130 --> 21:01.335
Where we got married two months ago.

21:03.090 --> 21:05.295
Didn't make it to Bora Bora, did you?

21:05.330 --> 21:06.975
No, we couldn't get there.

21:07.010 --> 21:09.255
Know the feeling.

21:09.290 --> 21:11.730
You haven't lost anyone
overboard, have you?

21:13.010 --> 21:17.170
We're on our honeymoon. We
didn't invite anyone else aboard.

21:21.350 --> 21:23.750
When are you gonna reopen the
harbour? I need to get out of here.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.015
Why are you in such a hurry?

21:27.050 --> 21:28.176
Why?

21:28.211 --> 21:30.775
Don't you watch the news?
I'm trying to set a solo record.

21:30.810 --> 21:32.335
Have you had anyone else onboard?

21:32.370 --> 21:33.615
Seriously?

21:33.943 --> 21:36.303
I don't even have room
to jerk off in there.

21:39.530 --> 21:40.895
Red-blooded boy.

21:40.930 --> 21:42.935
His boat smelt like teenager.

21:42.970 --> 21:44.615
What's the last vessel?

21:44.650 --> 21:46.450
The Hiraeth.

21:47.275 --> 21:50.320
Mr Abelard? Do you have a moment?

21:50.530 --> 21:53.775
With harbour locked, I
have nothing but moments.

21:53.810 --> 21:57.090
Is this a John Linden Berret?

21:58.330 --> 22:00.375
You've got a good eye, sir.

22:00.410 --> 22:03.735
The English are terrible cooks,
but masters of the sea.

22:03.770 --> 22:05.175
I'm Michael.

22:05.210 --> 22:08.935
Daniel Harrow, Soroya
Dass and... that guy.

22:08.970 --> 22:12.975
I think I need a drink.
You're most welcome to join me.

22:13.010 --> 22:15.815
Welcome aboard.

22:15.850 --> 22:18.015
Passport. Log.

22:18.050 --> 22:19.530
Thanks.
-Papers.

22:20.690 --> 22:23.135
And water of life.

22:29.090 --> 22:31.335
May the warm wind at your back...

22:31.370 --> 22:32.695
Be not your own.

22:35.650 --> 22:37.615
This is a large vessel to sail alone.

22:37.650 --> 22:41.375
For some men, a wilful girl
like this might be a handful.

22:41.410 --> 22:44.855
But I've got her for 20 years.
I know all her ins and outs.

22:44.890 --> 22:46.335
And where are you heading?

22:46.370 --> 22:48.775
I'm thinking Java,
where the women are beautiful

22:48.810 --> 22:51.175
and the men are tiny.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.585
And you've lost no-one overboard?

22:53.621 --> 22:56.495
Only my heart, to a beauty in Tuvalu.

22:56.530 --> 22:58.215
OK, I think we've seen enough.

22:58.784 --> 23:00.389
Thanks, Mr Abelard.

23:00.425 --> 23:01.575
Indeed.

23:01.610 --> 23:03.410
She's a fine vessel.

23:08.006 --> 23:10.535
Well, we still don't have any suspects.

23:10.570 --> 23:13.975
Maybe our John Doe came off
another boat that sailed right past.

23:14.010 --> 23:16.135
I guess we fly back tomorrow

23:16.170 --> 23:18.770
and keep at his dental
records until I get an ID.

23:20.450 --> 23:22.915
Listen, you guys are here another night.

23:23.210 --> 23:25.935
You should come to my
niece's party. Good food, wine.

23:25.970 --> 23:28.055
A lot more fun than your hotel rooms.

23:28.090 --> 23:30.210
Shall I text you the address?
-Yeah, great.

23:30.650 --> 23:32.450
Right, see you there.

23:33.930 --> 23:36.495
Could be fun.
-I don't know.

23:36.530 --> 23:38.775
If I see one more beautiful Italian,

23:38.810 --> 23:41.215
I fear my eyes will actually burn out.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.570
Come on. I'll wear something nice.

24:09.290 --> 24:10.575
Bruce.

24:13.250 --> 24:16.295
Hey, guys, you made it.
Welcome. Off-duty.

24:16.330 --> 24:17.855
So, here.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.775
It's, it's homemade.

24:19.810 --> 24:22.215
It's family wine. Sorry. It's
not terribly sophisticated.

24:22.250 --> 24:23.890
Anyway, come through. Meet everyone.

24:26.690 --> 24:28.735
Of course. Bloody delicious.

24:28.770 --> 24:29.975
It's good.

24:37.530 --> 24:39.095
Are you OK?

24:39.130 --> 24:40.650
Absolutely.

24:43.010 --> 24:45.010
What were you thinking about?

24:47.430 --> 24:50.750
How our John Doe's killer
got him to eat rat poison?

24:51.650 --> 24:53.735
You were thinking about work.

24:53.770 --> 24:55.050
Yes.

24:56.370 --> 24:58.575
Where does that come from,
that work ethic of yours?

24:58.610 --> 25:00.295
From your father or your mother?

25:00.330 --> 25:03.087
I would have to say my mother.

25:03.650 --> 25:06.015
What's she like?
-My mother. Well...

25:07.450 --> 25:13.250
Like me, but with all the warm,
social and endearing aspects removed.

25:15.450 --> 25:17.575
I'd like to meet her.

25:17.610 --> 25:19.290
I don't think you would.

25:20.850 --> 25:22.387
Why?

25:26.430 --> 25:27.990
What about your family?

25:29.250 --> 25:31.095
Soroya?

25:31.130 --> 25:33.015
Hey, sorry to interrupt,

25:33.050 --> 25:36.015
but Gianna here, she wants
to ask you something.

25:36.050 --> 25:39.335
I just wanted a woman's perspective
on joining the police. For a change.

25:40.810 --> 25:43.175
Well, maybe we should chat about

25:43.210 --> 25:46.610
how it shouldn't be any different
to a man joining the police.

25:57.290 --> 26:00.215
How could you not be?

26:00.552 --> 26:02.315
Not be what?

26:03.050 --> 26:05.295
In love with her.

26:05.330 --> 26:08.215
I'm not in love with her.
I work with her.

26:09.490 --> 26:13.770
Jesus Christ, do they let any
idiot into medical school?

26:14.300 --> 26:15.940
She could do better.

26:17.890 --> 26:19.495
Dominic.

26:19.825 --> 26:22.770
Come here, you saucy little bastard.

26:41.284 --> 26:42.727
Hey.

26:43.518 --> 26:44.998
You're leaving.

26:45.429 --> 26:46.754
Yeah.

26:48.729 --> 26:50.729
I wanted to dance with you.

26:53.831 --> 26:56.375
My daughter's turning 18
at the end of the week.

26:56.410 --> 26:58.455
And you're here and not there.

27:01.130 --> 27:05.650
Well, you'll be leaving soon and...
everything can go back to normal.

27:19.742 --> 27:21.026
Daniel.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.369
_

28:07.058 --> 28:09.371
_

29:51.810 --> 29:53.335
Shit.

29:53.370 --> 29:55.695
Shit. Hi.

29:55.730 --> 29:57.335
Are you sleeping in my office?

29:57.370 --> 29:58.858
No.

29:59.290 --> 30:01.215
Yes. How did you know?

30:01.250 --> 30:03.975
The leather squeaks when
you sit up. How come?

30:04.010 --> 30:06.135
You know, stuff to do.

30:06.170 --> 30:08.855
Right. I need a favour.
-Yeah...

30:08.890 --> 30:10.815
Now, there's a magazine on the boat.

30:10.850 --> 30:13.095
It's a catalogue of
British yachts for sale

30:13.130 --> 30:15.095
called British Yachts for Sale.

30:15.130 --> 30:18.215
I'm looking for the June 2011 issue.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.695
June 2011.

30:19.730 --> 30:24.255
Or perhaps it was the June
2012, or September 2012.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.575
I tell you what, have
a look at them all.

30:26.610 --> 30:28.815
You're looking for a sales listing

30:28.850 --> 30:32.815
for an original John
Linden Berret, 42 foot.

30:33.093 --> 30:35.495
OK, what if there's
more than one listed?

30:35.530 --> 30:39.055
Do you have any idea many original
JLBs there are in the world?

30:39.090 --> 30:41.095
No. No, I have a life.

30:41.130 --> 30:42.935
You see, the thing is, about JLBs is...

30:42.970 --> 30:45.015
OK, look, I'll get your boat porn.

30:45.050 --> 30:46.855
Good. I'll talk to you later.

30:46.890 --> 30:48.730
Wait, wait, wait. Um...

30:50.490 --> 30:53.415
I put the river bones concrete
through the CAT scan.

30:53.450 --> 30:54.655
And?

30:54.690 --> 30:56.810
Well, the concrete didn't
scan very well but...

30:57.910 --> 30:59.230
..there's something there.

31:00.530 --> 31:02.415
Something... Like what?

31:02.855 --> 31:06.516
Something like an orthopaedic plate.

31:07.077 --> 31:08.837
I'm gonna dig it out.

31:10.907 --> 31:14.655
Yeah, look, um, why don't
you wait until we get back?

31:14.690 --> 31:16.810
I'm sure Dass would like
to take a look at it.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.215
OK.

31:19.250 --> 31:21.055
Get me that catalogue.

32:13.690 --> 32:15.295
Jesus.

32:15.330 --> 32:17.576
Hi.
-Hi.

32:17.946 --> 32:19.577
Does he know you're here?

32:20.400 --> 32:22.400
Would I be here if he did?

32:27.290 --> 32:28.935
How is he?

32:28.970 --> 32:30.490
He's Harrow.

32:31.794 --> 32:33.375
He misses you.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.215
It's weird, right?

32:35.250 --> 32:38.255
He quit. He really was quitting.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.690
And then...

32:42.130 --> 32:43.572
Fern...

32:44.850 --> 32:47.135
I love him and I try and get
inside his head sometimes,

32:47.170 --> 32:50.295
but... your Dad's a
kind of a selfish guy,

32:50.330 --> 32:52.895
in the nicest possible way, of course.

32:54.650 --> 32:56.490
Don't tell him I was here.

33:01.250 --> 33:02.410
Hey.

33:04.447 --> 33:06.683
Happy birthday. For tomorrow.

33:08.490 --> 33:10.530
Thanks. Gotta go.

33:13.850 --> 33:16.175
That's Abelard's boat, the Hiraeth.

33:16.210 --> 33:17.735
Only it's not the Hiraeth.

33:17.770 --> 33:20.575
I recognised it as a John Linden Berret,

33:20.610 --> 33:23.455
and I remembered seeing one
like it in a sales catalogue.

33:23.490 --> 33:26.335
But it's not just like it, it IS it.

33:26.370 --> 33:27.975
Only here, it's the Gertie.

33:28.010 --> 33:30.175
But I mean, boats change names
when they change owners.

33:30.210 --> 33:32.643
Yeah, but Abelard claims
he's owned it for 20 years.

33:33.170 --> 33:35.095
Are you thinking he
killed the real owner?

33:35.130 --> 33:39.015
I saw him in the small hours,
carrying a bag of dead rats.

33:39.050 --> 33:40.650
Rat poison.

33:43.210 --> 33:44.725
Mr Abelard.

33:47.890 --> 33:51.335
Mr Abelard, we would like
to search your vessel.

33:51.370 --> 33:53.439
If it is your vessel.

33:53.690 --> 33:55.495
The Hiraeth is mine.

33:55.530 --> 33:57.695
But I bet the Gertie isn't.

33:57.730 --> 34:00.215
Where's the real owner? I have an idea.

34:00.250 --> 34:02.295
May we come aboard?

34:02.584 --> 34:04.189
Not without a warrant.

34:04.225 --> 34:07.015
Look, Mr Abelard, this is a simple
investigation. It'd be easier...

34:07.050 --> 34:09.935
Pathologists are not part
of simple investigations.

34:10.543 --> 34:12.574
You're investigating a murder.

34:13.059 --> 34:17.215
I have not committed a murder, so
you don't need to come on my boat.

34:17.250 --> 34:19.050
We'll get that warrant.
-Ha.

34:20.530 --> 34:22.215
Get the boat ready.

34:22.250 --> 34:23.775
We've got to go and see Judge Milner.

34:23.810 --> 34:25.735
Boat?
-He's golfing on Hamilton Island.

34:25.770 --> 34:27.014
North Queensland.

34:27.050 --> 34:28.655
You guys just sit tight.

34:28.690 --> 34:30.969
Abelard's not stupid enough
to try and leave the harbour.

34:40.539 --> 34:42.063
So, being a boat owner...

34:42.100 --> 34:43.136
Yeah?

34:43.170 --> 34:44.850
..is that a sound investment?

34:46.050 --> 34:49.255
Well, you're asking the
person that paid $5,000

34:49.290 --> 34:51.815
for an autograph of Andrey Kolmogorov.

34:51.850 --> 34:53.975
The mathematician?

34:54.010 --> 34:56.409
Yes.
-What's it worth now?

34:57.530 --> 34:59.170
I'd say about $3,000.

35:02.490 --> 35:04.610
Boats aren't about the money.

35:05.710 --> 35:08.790
They're about the promise.
-What, the promise of losing money?

35:09.930 --> 35:11.775
Or getting nicely lost.

35:12.971 --> 35:16.055
I haven't quite found
the wherewithal yet...

35:16.090 --> 35:18.375
..although it is on the horizon.

35:18.410 --> 35:20.690
You sneaky prick.

35:21.850 --> 35:25.215
He's getting fuel. He's leaving port.

35:25.250 --> 35:27.210
No, he's not. You stay here.

35:41.310 --> 35:43.030
Bugger this.

35:48.510 --> 35:50.823
Mr Abelard... You going somewhere?

35:50.859 --> 35:52.975
Me?

35:53.010 --> 35:55.055
Hey, settle down.

35:55.090 --> 35:56.895
Mate, settle down.

35:58.131 --> 35:59.370
Aagh.

36:00.730 --> 36:03.615
Peter Abelard, I am arresting
you on suspicion of murder.

36:03.650 --> 36:05.895
You have the right to...

36:05.930 --> 36:07.890
Bastard.

36:11.970 --> 36:14.294
Good, you found him.

36:25.530 --> 36:26.975
You OK?

36:27.010 --> 36:29.175
Well, I'd rather not be sitting
in the back of an ambulance.

36:29.915 --> 36:32.450
You're gonna have to.
Local rules prevail.

36:33.674 --> 36:34.999
What are you gonna do?

36:35.399 --> 36:38.815
The local yacht expert and I are
going to inspect Abelard's boat.

36:45.759 --> 36:48.636
You stay here, Doctor. I'll
let you know if I need you.

36:52.050 --> 36:53.815
It's a nice boat.

36:53.850 --> 36:55.695
Yes, she is.

36:55.730 --> 36:58.935
Did I tell you it was
a John Linden Berret?

36:58.970 --> 37:02.370
Yes, you did. About 14 times.

37:45.290 --> 37:47.050
I hate lizards...

37:51.610 --> 37:53.335
Lizard smuggler.

37:53.370 --> 37:56.015
Big money for Australian
reptiles on the black market.

37:56.050 --> 37:57.735
You were right about his boat.

37:57.770 --> 38:01.615
The registered owner of the Gertie
is a 52-year-old Dutch national.

38:01.650 --> 38:04.535
Fits the description of
our poisoned John Doe.

38:04.570 --> 38:09.095
What I don't understand is if
he's feeding rats to his reptiles,

38:09.130 --> 38:11.472
why run the risk of
having rat poison around?

38:11.694 --> 38:15.014
We'll figure it out. Well done.

38:26.730 --> 38:29.055
Never gave me time to lay a bet.

38:29.090 --> 38:30.895
Where would you have put it?

38:30.930 --> 38:33.095
On Abelard. But now that I've
heard about your left hook...

38:33.130 --> 38:35.375
And glass jaw, apparently.

38:35.410 --> 38:38.528
Either way, they won't let
me go until they've X-rayed.

38:38.970 --> 38:40.570
May I?

38:48.010 --> 38:49.855
You're very beautiful.

38:49.890 --> 38:52.010
What?
-What?

38:53.410 --> 38:56.815
This thing looks more dangerous
to be in it than out of it.

38:56.850 --> 38:58.410
Rules.

38:59.140 --> 39:01.025
Sergeant Dass?
-Hey.

39:01.710 --> 39:04.390
I guess that's me. See ya.

39:10.470 --> 39:12.470
Hello?
-It's me.

39:14.370 --> 39:16.375
It's good to hear from you.

39:16.410 --> 39:20.415
You'll be pleased to know
old Hovard's kicked it.

39:21.091 --> 39:25.686
So, whatever you've done,
your secret's safe.

39:27.010 --> 39:30.210
Unless, of course, there's
something you want to tell me?

39:59.530 --> 40:00.735
Capello?

40:00.770 --> 40:03.535
It's Harrow. Lena Penn
has been poisoned.

40:03.570 --> 40:05.210
Meet me at the Flyaway.

40:10.410 --> 40:11.935
Hello.

40:11.970 --> 40:13.426
Penn?

40:20.490 --> 40:21.810
Hello?

40:28.890 --> 40:30.410
Hello?

41:50.570 --> 41:53.290
Should have hit you harder.

41:55.258 --> 41:58.610
Yeah, sorry. I've got a hard head.

42:05.528 --> 42:07.928
How much do you think
you'll get for the Flyaway?

42:08.610 --> 42:09.890
Two million.

42:10.398 --> 42:11.918
Enough to kill for.

42:13.910 --> 42:16.030
Enough to kill twice for.

42:24.761 --> 42:26.606
Harbour's open again.

42:26.942 --> 42:29.342
Why don't you just dump me out at sea?

42:31.410 --> 42:34.695
Lena's still in hospital. You
can't leave without her.

42:34.730 --> 42:36.610
That's loyalty.

42:38.427 --> 42:40.392
How does this work?

42:41.210 --> 42:44.495
You hang out in some yachtsman's port,

42:44.530 --> 42:48.895
scouting for some rich,
lonely, middle-aged guy,

42:48.930 --> 42:50.490
and Lena's the honey trap.

42:52.030 --> 42:54.590
If you'd seen how quickly
these idiots jumped at it...

42:56.290 --> 42:59.975
She seduces and marries the poor sap,

43:00.010 --> 43:02.735
the real Mr Penn in this case,

43:02.770 --> 43:04.455
who thinks he's won the lottery.

43:04.490 --> 43:08.810
Sailing on a tropical
honeymoon until garlic o'clock.

43:33.081 --> 43:35.175
Poison's a woman's weapon.

43:35.210 --> 43:37.210
She was alone, wasn't she?

43:39.080 --> 43:40.760
She's a brave girl.

43:50.890 --> 43:53.055
And with hubby out of the way,

43:53.090 --> 43:56.695
Lena took what you'd need
to steal his identity.

44:02.088 --> 44:03.935
She dumps the body.

44:04.075 --> 44:09.035
You come aboard and she
starts her special makeover.

44:10.690 --> 44:14.095
And the boat's all yours, ready to sell.

44:14.130 --> 44:16.815
After we come aboard asking questions,

44:16.850 --> 44:19.015
Lena dumps the poison.

44:29.410 --> 44:31.175
I don't like lizards.

44:31.781 --> 44:35.249
The question is... will they like you?

44:35.989 --> 44:38.023
I think they will.

44:39.970 --> 44:41.850
You can stop trying
to undo my knots now.

44:43.263 --> 44:44.583
It's too late.

44:53.530 --> 44:56.175
No. I'm serious.

44:56.210 --> 44:58.815
I cannot stand lizards.

44:58.850 --> 45:02.126
Do me a favour and hit
me over the head again.

45:02.570 --> 45:04.295
Lena usually does the killing, mate.

45:04.330 --> 45:05.754
Come on.

45:06.050 --> 45:08.690
You wouldn't want to be taken by
one of those things, would you?

45:36.490 --> 45:38.610
Aaaaagh.

45:59.370 --> 46:01.050
Bloody hurts, doesn't it?

46:27.890 --> 46:29.695
You've got three in your cells now.

46:29.730 --> 46:31.707
It's a full house. That never happens.

46:31.743 --> 46:33.655
We'll be talking about this for a while.

46:33.690 --> 46:35.935
So, if the body's the real Mr Penn,

46:35.970 --> 46:37.695
what about the owner of Abelard's boat?

46:37.730 --> 46:40.415
The Dutchman? Apparently,
he and Abelard are partners.

46:40.450 --> 46:42.455
No wonder he wasn't talking.

46:42.490 --> 46:44.375
What about Mr Penn's body?

46:44.410 --> 46:46.175
We've contacted his daughter.

46:46.210 --> 46:49.495
They're estranged, but she'll
come here to collect his remains.

46:49.530 --> 46:52.156
Doctor, here. It's birthday cake.

46:52.192 --> 46:54.272
You left the party before
you could try some.

46:55.410 --> 46:56.970
Grazie.
-Prego.

46:58.919 --> 47:00.999
Thanks for your help.
-See you soon, yeah?

47:03.375 --> 47:06.100
Of course. Perfect.
-Doctor?

47:06.191 --> 47:08.311
You're welcome here any time.

47:09.650 --> 47:11.370
Good cake.

47:28.850 --> 47:31.095
You liked it up there, didn't you?

47:31.130 --> 47:34.210
Boats. Open water. Escape.

47:35.162 --> 47:36.566
Yeah.

47:41.910 --> 47:44.790
Look, the other night, up
there, outside the party...

47:53.650 --> 47:56.725
Anyway, you made it home for
your daughter's birthday, right?

47:58.850 --> 48:00.055
Yeah.

48:00.090 --> 48:01.610
Yeah.

48:51.690 --> 48:53.135
Hello.

48:53.170 --> 48:54.975
Still up there?
-No.

48:55.010 --> 48:56.822
No, I'm back.

48:58.530 --> 48:59.576
She there?

48:59.611 --> 49:02.050
No.

49:03.068 --> 49:04.353
Yep.

49:05.209 --> 49:08.695
How do 18 years go by so fast?

49:09.153 --> 49:10.850
Do you remember when it started?

49:12.090 --> 49:13.735
It was December.

49:13.770 --> 49:16.810
Everyone was backing up,
freaking out about Y2K.

49:18.210 --> 49:19.855
And I was freaking out

49:19.890 --> 49:21.855
about whether the hot young
teacher I was seeing that night

49:21.890 --> 49:23.605
would say yes.

49:25.370 --> 49:27.735
It was quite a yes.

49:28.096 --> 49:30.050
She was quite a girl.

49:34.410 --> 49:36.490
Why don't you come over?

49:41.910 --> 49:43.350
You think I should?

49:46.870 --> 49:48.590
No.

49:50.130 --> 49:51.650
Goodnight.

50:00.250 --> 50:02.543
What do you think of this, Fish?

50:02.890 --> 50:04.375
C.

50:08.570 --> 50:10.530
I think it's pretty good.

50:14.966 --> 50:16.655
What do you think?

50:17.267 --> 50:18.610
Fish?.

50:19.610 --> 50:21.090
It's great.

50:28.410 --> 50:30.735
OK, the river bones.

50:31.237 --> 50:33.237
I know you told me to wait.

50:34.719 --> 50:37.599
You got them all out?
-You're gonna love this.

50:39.750 --> 50:42.790
I got the radius, and it
is an orthopaedic plate.

50:43.576 --> 50:46.141
I should have waited, I know.

50:46.177 --> 50:48.297
But look at this.

50:53.570 --> 50:55.415
See?

50:55.450 --> 50:57.130
It's a serial number.

50:58.170 --> 51:01.210
We can look this up and find
out exactly who this guy is.

51:05.810 --> 51:08.095
Next on Harrow...

51:08.130 --> 51:09.216
With this...

51:09.251 --> 51:10.575
We'll find our guy.

51:10.960 --> 51:13.160
Steph's nice.

51:13.731 --> 51:15.936
Do you still love her?

51:16.450 --> 51:18.895
I can't keep doing this.
-Doing what?

51:18.930 --> 51:22.015
Sleeping in strange
places. I can't... I can't.

51:23.051 --> 51:26.255
Some bones are missing but most
of them are from this hand.

51:26.290 --> 51:29.375
She was lying out here
for years, unnoticed.

51:29.410 --> 51:31.095
Or noticed but unreported.

51:31.130 --> 51:33.970
I told ya, it's nobody's business.
