48:33.039 --> 48:35.883
Typical crusader bastard.

48:37.562 --> 48:43.015
You said you wanted a job.
That is: take it out of my back.

48:43.368 --> 48:49.129
But you need me for that.
Anyone can kill.

48:49.344 --> 48:51.278
That's the problem, we can not.

48:51.942 --> 48:54.370
If you do, starts a war all right.

48:56.580 --> 48:59.636
You said that you can do
impossible things new.

49:01.245 --> 49:02.904
Proves it.

49:12.120 --> 49:15.146
- What's this?
- Price.

49:18.939 --> 49:20.695
It's a big number.

49:25.888 --> 49:27.420
All right.

50:12.068 --> 50:14.693
- Give it to n futere ...!
- I'm sorry, excuse me.

50:16.744 --> 50:18.439
I'll take another.

50:21.555 --> 50:23.468
Please give to me a coffee yet?

51:10.515 --> 51:12.231
How did you do it?

51:12.250 --> 51:14.715
The newspaper said
that he had pulled from the heart.

51:19.548 --> 51:21.505
Liquid nicotine.

51:22.360 --> 51:29.244
I want all the details, the whole story.
But first celebration.

51:30.869 --> 51:34.352
<i>Roxy, Angel, he is Victor.</i>

52:09.800 --> 52:11.427
Let him down.

52:12.747 --> 52:14.578
Let him down.

52:17.882 --> 52:21.929
Roxy, looking for her.
Angel, you're on it.

52:22.232 --> 52:23.662
Faster!

52:30.345 --> 52:32.040
Give it to me.

52:34.465 --> 52:37.951
You drive.

52:43.918 --> 52:45.493
Bring me the Kovacs!

52:48.546 --> 52:50.584
Where I-to-i Kovacs?

53:01.886 --> 53:03.797
What happened?

53:11.286 --> 53:13.550
Someone knew that coming.

53:17.222 --> 53:19.145
Let me guess...

53:22.272 --> 53:26.971
I knew cocksucker 'That was trouble
as he entered the door.

53:27.652 --> 53:31.198
Why? Undercover?

53:31.537 --> 53:34.384
You're <i> cop, asshole?</i>

53:44.102 --> 53:46.127
You could answer.

54:07.025 --> 54:09.681
Shit... Ordinary...

54:10.128 --> 54:15.111
You sold me Brett.
For what?

54:16.601 --> 54:19.297
Did I think will provide entry?

54:20.238 --> 54:22.263
<i>What did you say?</i>

54:52.266 --> 54:55.130
I can not believe
as I could to deceive.

54:55.323 --> 54:58.698
It happens, it's hard.

54:58.962 --> 55:02.720
With everyone else, all the time.
Only you know what they say...

55:03.915 --> 55:09.852
- The more nearly...
- Yes, but you saw.

55:10.228 --> 55:13.910
I'm from outside, look inside easier.

55:13.911 --> 55:20.095
Now you're inside.
You can still see them more?

55:20.932 --> 55:23.318
I can not say.

55:24.268 --> 55:26.757
Kovacs did not know anything about you.

55:27.939 --> 55:34.716
Yes, it can. Or maybe not.
I can not risk it.

55:34.739 --> 55:37.347
Okay, so you have to go.

55:38.880 --> 55:41.153
Do me one last favor.

55:51.174 --> 55:54.016
Do not worry you do
look like an accident.

55:56.699 --> 55:59.366
This is to convey a message.

56:02.479 --> 56:04.636
Goodbye, Victor.

57:07.408 --> 57:09.350
Sorry, can you help?

57:29.460 --> 57:33.517
Calm down...
And you want some of this?

57:36.359 --> 57:39.068
Good, leave us more.

57:39.224 --> 57:41.577
The thing is that we can not leave
yet to go.

58:08.787 --> 58:10.444
As the man said...

58:50.494 --> 58:51.996
Enough.

01:00:05.383 --> 01:00:08.249
- What have you lost?
- Chain and side the...

01:00:14.492 --> 01:00:17.676
I gotta go.
Immediately.

01:00:47.024 --> 01:00:48.855
Not coming?

01:00:49.627 --> 01:00:51.992
Expect to occur next.

01:00:52.264 --> 01:00:54.639
It does not seem right to leave and to a

I've never done this before.

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:42.230
Leave, not a good idea.

01:02:44.508 --> 01:02:46.229
Even the worst.

01:03:38.852 --> 01:03:42.856
Six months later

01:04:16.879 --> 01:04:18.744

- I do not want to leave.
- So give me a reason to stay.

01:04:44.628 --> 01:04:47.441
Do you really want to know
what I do ...?

01:04:48.632 --> 01:04:49.963
Yes.

Are you sure?

01:04:54.501 --> 01:04:55.865
Yes.

01:06:58.149 --> 01:07:00.142
You will not need that.

Did I can say once.

01:07:32.389 --> 01:07:33.911
You're dead.

01:07:35.466 --> 01:07:39.618
Get out of town, in the country.
Tonight.

01:07:41.238 --> 01:07:45.437
Do not ever come back.
Understand?

01:07:48.145 --> 01:07:49.669
Go.

01:08:24.363 --> 01:08:28.442

I do not know, think thi. First time
in my life when I have a plan.

01:08:53.805 --> 01:08:56.661
But we'll figure something together.

And what kind of father
do you think you are?

01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:02.113
One powerful.

You left behind a life of violence

01:09:15.292 --> 01:09:18.187
It was strange it was not
the so simple.

<i>How did you find me?</i>

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:27.287
A British cop knew something.

01:11:27.331 --> 01:11:31.299
And others?
Mark and Alex?

01:11:33.638 --> 01:11:37.101

I've never heard of it since then.

01:11:48.572 --> 01:11:52.300
Mark... is still there.

01:11:52.756 --> 01:11:55.919

I warn you, Caesar.

01:12:25.956 --> 01:12:30.447
Do you think that after so long,
believing you're dead

01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:36.395
Trafficker would like Vadim
to know that you were alive and well?

01:12:37.670 --> 01:12:41.949
Then why not to them and
to come and deal with me?

01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:46.320
Then they would come
after you all know...

01:12:47.104 --> 01:12:51.102
- And you never escape.
- I escaped and last time.

01:12:51.615 --> 01:12:55.293

I think you know too much, Caesar.

01:13:01.825 --> 01:13:04.692
I am the only one who knows
you're alive.

01:13:04.728 --> 01:13:08.220
Then do not say anything.

01:13:08.265 --> 01:13:13.648
I mean, I had no choice so far.

01:13:14.610 --> 01:13:16.976
I never wanted to do it!

01:13:17.499 --> 01:13:22.104
Come on, Victor, I am, We're brothers.

01:13:25.738 --> 01:13:29.172
I do not think they are.

That's why he has never understood.

Him and to have killed
whenever I would have felt like.

01:13:51.731 --> 01:13:53.952
<i>Even when Sergei sent him.</i>

01:13:54.578 --> 01:13:59.481
But I chose not to do, of loyalty.

01:14:00.117 --> 01:14:06.650
Of loyalty?
Victor, please, just not going to do that!

01:14:06.899 --> 01:14:10.835

About a year ago...

- I tried to help her, but...
- And the money you send them?

01:15:56.791 --> 01:16:01.552
Gregory and Flavius ​​took control
after you left.

01:16:02.415 --> 01:16:04.212
I'm sorry...

When they told me that died and I...

Nice to see you.

01:17:24.521 --> 01:17:29.186
- What did you do?
- Franco? It is alive.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.889

But this time You had no choice.

How do you know?

Rumors first but are always rumors.

Then cop chasing ghosts...

01:18:04.908 --> 01:18:07.571
I did not really think it.

01:18:09.264 --> 01:18:12.447
Until I received a video with you.

01:18:13.595 --> 01:18:16.366
That was a real shock.

01:18:17.474 --> 01:18:19.135
How did you get it?

01:18:19.922 --> 01:18:24.361

Others believe that ox
arrived there by yourself?

01:18:45.368 --> 01:18:50.070
When I saw how you handled
of those guys, I was proud.

01:18:52.642 --> 01:18:55.289
I have a broken heart
When I gave the order.

01:18:55.801 --> 01:19:00.402
But you did.
And I'm still here.

01:19:01.377 --> 01:19:06.892

He has power, your discipline.
Things that unite us.

01:19:26.272 --> 01:19:30.637
<i>Come to Bury past mistakes, Victoria.</i>

01:19:31.915 --> 01:19:36.403
Drink, eat, then go separate ways.

01:19:36.925 --> 01:19:40.758
- Good. No hard feelings?
- You deleted.

01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:47.965
Did you show loyalty,
even in extreme circumstances.

01:19:48.431 --> 01:19:50.838
I always knew <i> that you are special.</i>

01:19:51.968 --> 01:19:55.854
'Cold as Stone'
and to tell you to Sergey.

01:19:57.021 --> 01:20:00.081

Can.

01:20:06.039 --> 01:20:08.143
You know, I always wondered...

I think it was as hard for him
and as for me.

So, what would you say?

01:20:28.071 --> 01:20:31.718
He was only the soles,
As I did they said.

01:20:36.661 --> 01:20:39.926
I never imagined that it will be
Really easy to him.

01:20:42.057 --> 01:20:45.788
There are those who think <i> and then
there are those who perform, Victor.</i>

01:20:46.876 --> 01:20:53.797
November 2 think. He just executed.
You can not change human nature.

01:20:56.699 --> 01:20:59.196
Yes, you're probably right.

01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:11.626
At least we agree about something.

01:22:32.515 --> 01:22:35.460
Yes, I still say that lately.

01:22:37.967 --> 01:22:40.700
If you're here means
that the drug is dead.

01:22:44.736 --> 01:22:46.865
You have a wonderful family.

01:22:49.733 --> 01:22:52.463
- Do not...
<i>- Do not be so naive.</i>

01:22:54.684 --> 01:22:56.976
You sold me traffickers.

01:22:58.602 --> 01:23:02.761
I did not, Victoria I only wish.

01:23:05.261 --> 01:23:07.525
But it was and debt.

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:16.670
<i>I figured I could use
me break it to them.</i>

01:23:18.236 --> 01:23:20.172
For their sake.

01:23:34.763 --> 01:23:37.095
<i>bury recordings, Alex.</i>

01:23:38.952 --> 01:23:40.765
As you...

01:23:41.998 --> 01:23:44.863
And I wanted a reason to break me.

01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:52.463
I thought you'd kill me.

01:24:00.703 --> 01:24:03.085
If you have to come here again...

01:24:05.021 --> 01:24:06.545
I will.

01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:15.875
Did you let him live?

01:24:17.319 --> 01:24:20.452
- Had too much to lose.
<i>- Just like you.</i>

01:24:21.504 --> 01:24:24.280
Probably yes, like me.

01:24:24.943 --> 01:24:27.913
Look, I'm sorry your mom.

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:32.282
Why?
You did not know her.

01:24:36.837 --> 01:24:38.398
It must be.

01:24:38.414 --> 01:24:40.334
- To open?
- No.

01:24:43.517 --> 01:24:45.235
For you.

01:25:02.445 --> 01:25:04.345
What's going on?

01:25:06.116 --> 01:25:08.846
- Put the gun down.
- Where'd you get that?

01:25:09.745 --> 01:25:12.612
- Why?
- He's my brother.

01:25:12.630 --> 01:25:14.351
Are you sure?

01:25:14.352 --> 01:25:16.072
Of course they're safe!
Where'd you get that?

01:25:18.288 --> 01:25:19.623
I got it.

01:25:20.681 --> 01:25:24.453
- Yesterday, when I saw him.
- You killed my brother?

01:25:27.536 --> 01:25:30.047
Did not know that the team secret?

01:25:32.881 --> 01:25:34.463
Why?

01:25:36.311 --> 01:25:37.938
Bethesda...

01:25:42.919 --> 01:25:45.208
He brings up yourself.

01:25:54.797 --> 01:25:57.383
I saw that got many times...

01:25:58.267 --> 01:26:02.654
What a story...
And the vision of...

01:26:04.707 --> 01:26:07.141
One thing I put the thought.

01:26:07.176 --> 01:26:11.272
I never understood why
You left alive the king at the end.

01:26:16.278 --> 01:26:19.519
Let me to tell me
a story about another king.

01:26:20.309 --> 01:26:25.026
A cruel king that reigned over
realm mercilessly and without laws.

01:26:27.773 --> 01:26:32.824
A peasant, an honest and hardworking,
found himself once owed the king.

01:26:33.342 --> 01:26:36.235
But peasants had what to pay.

01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:41.765
So I asked him the king of price
thing we have...

01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:45.204
Two daughters preafrumoase its...

01:26:46.349 --> 01:26:52.245
Peasants did not want to give...
So I killed him.

01:26:54.190 --> 01:26:59.605
The two girls were made to serve
and the king needs his friends.

01:27:01.530 --> 01:27:05.432
One too weak fu for their desires.

01:27:07.353 --> 01:27:09.989
Other sister was strong...

01:27:10.734 --> 01:27:14.636
A patient. And he learned
about the nature of men.

01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:19.480
The poor was my sister.

01:27:23.743 --> 01:27:28.063
No wonder not you recognize me,
I was only 10 years...

01:27:28.328 --> 01:27:33.739
I will however have remained one thousand
întipãriþi in mind, you and your brother.

01:27:35.786 --> 01:27:38.739
That was a long time ago,
was a mistake.

01:27:39.068 --> 01:27:42.388
One that you repeat a long,
As I recall.

01:27:46.976 --> 01:27:52.678
Please, that's all ...?

01:27:55.885 --> 01:27:58.445
I knew you would not be missed
one of the the subject.

01:27:58.716 --> 01:28:01.446
Opportunity to interview
a man like him.

01:28:02.429 --> 01:28:05.644
To hear a story
Did that would ensure return...

01:28:05.701 --> 01:28:09.300
A chance to be back 'Great man'.

01:28:11.462 --> 01:28:15.748
But it was an illusion, Projects
to make you dream again.

01:28:17.229 --> 01:28:21.533
And to be me who Do you take it.

01:28:45.601 --> 01:28:47.432

I know what you ask.

01:29:49.031 --> 01:29:50.726
<i>'Why'</i>

01:29:52.668 --> 01:29:56.006

01:29:56.705 --> 01:29:58.730
<i>to make to me you're in love...</i>

01:30:00.216 --> 01:30:02.343

<i>pain, Victor. Pain
I lose to those whom he loves you.</i>

01:30:11.053 --> 01:30:14.250
I did you and you lose it.

01:30:16.959 --> 01:30:19.154
I sold <i> I Trafficker.</i>

01:30:20.963 --> 01:30:26.597
<i>I knew would come after you.
And I knew that he will kill me.</i>

01:30:29.983 --> 01:30:32.574
<i>And then you were gone...</i>

01:30:33.803 --> 01:30:37.799
And he...
And now, just you.

01:30:41.519 --> 01:30:45.091
Not yet, not yet...

01:30:47.289 --> 01:30:50.083
is something <i> you should know it.</i>

01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:58.020
It's a boy, baby.

<i>your boy.
The boy you always dreamed of.</i>

01:31:07.443 --> 01:31:11.807
<i>And it will be quite large,
I will show you was...</i>

01:31:11.832 --> 01:31:13.952
<i>And he will disdain.</i>

01:31:17.007 --> 01:31:18.999
<i>were right, Victor.</i>

01:31:24.984 --> 01:31:28.537
Sometimes a simple bullet
is not enough.
