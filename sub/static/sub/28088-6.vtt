00:36.000 --> 00:38.008
What's the day's date?

00:38.008 --> 00:40.004
Eh, 1st of November.

00:40.004 --> 00:42.040
Oh, you beauty!

00:42.040 --> 00:43.060
Jesus, Jack!

00:43.060 --> 00:45.036
It's rippy-affy day!

00:45.036 --> 00:47.064
Rippy-affy day?

00:47.064 --> 00:49.052
I hope you're not talking about
your clothes.

00:49.052 --> 00:53.072
No. I'm talking about
my Scottish Nature Trust calendar.

00:53.072 --> 00:56.072
Yes, you want to see
the photographs in here, boy.

00:56.072 --> 01:00.024
And, today, I get to find out what
November has to offer.

01:00.024 --> 01:01.056
You mean you've no' looked at it
yet?

01:01.056 --> 01:03.008
Of course I've no' looked.

01:03.008 --> 01:04.075
Well, you see,
when I get a calendar,

01:04.075 --> 01:07.040
I like to take a good ten minutes
and peruse every month.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.000
Then I know what I'm
looking forward to

01:09.000 --> 01:11.068
when I flip over to the next month.

01:11.068 --> 01:13.080
Nae...rippy-affy.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.080
See, that's where you and I differ.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.076
You don't enjoy a surprise.

01:19.008 --> 01:21.056
And another thing you do that gets
right on my tits...

01:22.096 --> 01:25.008
Gets on your tits now, is it, Jack?

01:25.008 --> 01:27.008
Right, come on, then, give us it.

01:27.008 --> 01:28.096
Get it off your tits.

01:28.096 --> 01:32.016
Every year at my birthday,

01:32.016 --> 01:33.064
you do give me a gift,

01:33.064 --> 01:36.040
but while I'm opening it,
before I've seen it, mind,

01:36.040 --> 01:38.036
you tell me what it is.

01:38.036 --> 01:40.076
I'm only priming you
in case you don't like it.

01:40.076 --> 01:42.096
Anyroads, I've only ever done that
once!Once?

01:42.096 --> 01:44.096
You do it every single year!

01:44.096 --> 01:46.088
Mug. Socks.

01:46.088 --> 01:48.076
Wine. Tie.

01:48.076 --> 01:50.012
It's a shirt.

01:51.060 --> 01:54.088
You can take it back if it's too
tight. It was big on me.

01:57.024 --> 01:59.088
Why am I getting the feeling you
know what the next photograph is?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.004
Because I do.

02:02.004 --> 02:04.056
So you've been looking through
my Scottish Nature Trust calendar?

02:04.056 --> 02:05.096
I have.

02:05.096 --> 02:10.020
Whenever you make a cup of tea
or go for a pish,

02:10.020 --> 02:11.051
I rummage through it.

02:12.060 --> 02:13.088
I can't help myself.

02:13.088 --> 02:16.032
Well, I don't know what
the next photograph is,

02:16.032 --> 02:17.072
and I do not want to know.

02:17.072 --> 02:19.004
Righto, Jack.

02:19.004 --> 02:21.012
Do not ruin this for me, Victor.

02:26.056 --> 02:28.024
Ben Lomond!

02:28.024 --> 02:29.076
Oh, you bastard!

02:30.084 --> 02:33.008
ISA:Oh, that's lovely.

02:33.008 --> 02:34.060
An osprey...

02:34.060 --> 02:36.088
..way up high in the sky,

02:36.088 --> 02:38.092
having a wee fly.

02:38.092 --> 02:43.008
TV:In recent years, the natural
habitat of the African wild mongoose

02:43.008 --> 02:44.068
has come under threat.

02:44.068 --> 02:46.000
Oh, dear.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.048
And this little fella
needs your help.

02:48.048 --> 02:49.052
Oh!

02:49.052 --> 02:50.088
Helping couldn't be easier.

02:50.088 --> 02:53.040
Simply text "mongoose"
from your phone now,

02:53.040 --> 02:54.096
and for as little as £3 a month,

02:54.096 --> 02:57.080
you can ensure this little critter's
days are care free.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.012
M-O-N...

03:01.084 --> 03:03.048
Eh, here, Boabby.

03:03.048 --> 03:04.080
It's the 1st of November the day -

03:04.080 --> 03:07.008
are you no' gonnae change
your dirty, manky calendar?

03:07.008 --> 03:09.092
Oh, thanks for the heads-up, Jack.

03:13.080 --> 03:16.072
Hello, November.

03:16.072 --> 03:20.080
If that lassie went out like that
in November, she'd get hypothermia.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.060
She really should have a cardigan
on her.

03:23.060 --> 03:26.008
I don't bother buying a calendar.

03:26.008 --> 03:27.088
I just use the same one every year.

03:27.088 --> 03:31.052
Well, how would that work?
The days would all be different.

03:31.052 --> 03:34.000
I know that. I'm no' an idiot.

03:35.020 --> 03:37.056
If Christmas falls on a Tuesday
one year,

03:37.056 --> 03:40.020
then the next year, I just name
the Tuesday "Wednesday".

03:40.020 --> 03:44.012
A bit of mental gymnastics,
but it's good for the old grey matter, you know?

03:44.012 --> 03:46.016
And, of course,
there's a saving to be made.

03:46.016 --> 03:49.004
So what calendar
are you working off of?

03:49.004 --> 03:51.092
The wedding of Charles and Di, 1981.

03:53.068 --> 03:56.096
So what day does Hogmanay fall on
this year, Tam?

03:56.096 --> 04:00.064
That's simple enough. You give me...

04:00.064 --> 04:02.052
..three or four hours
and a calculator,

04:02.052 --> 04:04.076
and I'll get right back to you.
SCOFFS

04:04.076 --> 04:07.032
See that photie of Ben Lomond?

04:07.032 --> 04:09.008
Aye.

04:09.008 --> 04:10.072
Well, every year for years now,

04:10.072 --> 04:13.024
we have promised ourselves
to walk up that.

04:13.024 --> 04:15.084
And every year, we never do.

04:15.084 --> 04:18.084
We give it, "Ach, we'll wait till
the midgies die down.

04:18.084 --> 04:20.091
"We'll go in October."

04:20.091 --> 04:22.096
Aye, but then October
turns into November

04:22.096 --> 04:24.076
and, before too long,
we're pulling Christmas crackers

04:24.076 --> 04:28.008
and lamenting the fact that, once
again, we've reneged on ourselves.

04:29.036 --> 04:32.060
Maybe we should just stop
disappointing ourselves and admit defeat.

04:32.060 --> 04:34.004
I want to do it.

04:34.004 --> 04:35.052
When?

04:35.052 --> 04:37.020
Well, right now the weather's mild.

04:37.020 --> 04:38.088
Nigh-on perfect conditions.

04:40.008 --> 04:41.096
I've made my mind up.

04:41.096 --> 04:43.084
I want to go up Ben Lomond.

04:43.084 --> 04:45.056
I'll come wi' you.

04:45.056 --> 04:46.096
I'll humph your stuff.

04:46.096 --> 04:48.012
Oh, don't do yourself down.

04:48.012 --> 04:50.060
You, like my good self,
are a pioneer.

04:52.040 --> 04:54.076
Let these silly bastards
do the stuff-humphing.

04:54.076 --> 04:57.056
MUTTERING:Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday...

04:59.008 --> 05:00.068
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday...

05:00.068 --> 05:02.060
Sunday becomes... Is it Saturday?

05:07.048 --> 05:08.072
Right, listen up!

05:08.072 --> 05:10.020
We've got something to say.

05:10.020 --> 05:11.036
Jack?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.020
Friends, colleagues,

05:15.020 --> 05:17.080
associates...
Hurry up.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.024
Thank you.

05:19.024 --> 05:22.044
Victor and I have decided that...

05:22.044 --> 05:24.028
Victor?

05:24.028 --> 05:31.032
That we assembled here today shall
not endeavour but indeed conquer.

05:31.032 --> 05:34.088
So, we cordially invite you
to join us in conquering

05:34.088 --> 05:38.016
the world-famous Munro, Ben Lomond!

05:39.036 --> 05:42.020
ALL LAUGH

05:43.056 --> 05:45.032
Well, that went well.

05:45.032 --> 05:47.096
Aye, not very embarrassing at all.
I say up them, Victor.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.012
Yes, up them.

05:49.012 --> 05:51.028
We should phone Shug, though.
Do things right.

05:51.028 --> 05:53.000
Aye, belts and braces.
He'll tell us what to get.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.028
Aye. We're no' young men.
We've got to be organised.

05:55.028 --> 05:57.068
Aye. Aw, Christ.What?

05:57.068 --> 05:59.024
One of those arseholes.

05:59.024 --> 06:00.088
Do you have it?

06:00.088 --> 06:02.028
Yes. Always.

06:03.072 --> 06:05.052
Get it out.Not quite yet.

06:05.052 --> 06:07.060
Deploy it, Jack.Steady.

06:07.060 --> 06:08.080
Hold.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.048
And there we go.

06:10.048 --> 06:11.064
Have you got a minute there, gents?

06:11.064 --> 06:13.044
Oh, I'm sorry, son, I cannae let you

06:13.044 --> 06:17.004
interrupt our wee game
of tennis-baw-chucky-baw.

06:19.088 --> 06:21.060
Aw, Christ.

06:27.032 --> 06:30.036
Here, that's a different-coloured
top you're wearing the day.

06:30.036 --> 06:32.040
Are you working for another charity
now?

06:32.040 --> 06:34.060
As a matter of fact I am, yes.
What is it?

06:34.060 --> 06:36.004
It's a charity that's working to
stem

06:36.004 --> 06:38.000
the black-market trade of
Madagascan lovebirds.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.008
I've actually just finished my shift

06:39.008 --> 06:40.072
so I'll get you next time.
You'll get me...?

06:40.072 --> 06:44.052
You've got me the now!
Funny you should mention lovebirds.

06:44.052 --> 06:46.052
My uncle had a parakeet.

06:46.052 --> 06:50.080
He got it in 1960, but they're very
long-lived, these wee treasures.

06:50.080 --> 06:53.088
Anyroads, he taught it to say,

06:53.088 --> 06:57.008
"Up your ...kin' hole!
Up your ...kin' hole!"

06:57.008 --> 06:58.064
SHE CHUCKLES

06:58.064 --> 07:01.048
Oh, my.
And one day, ma Auntie Sadie

07:01.048 --> 07:04.036
tried to give it a wee bit of
cuttlefish, you know?

07:04.036 --> 07:07.020
Here, it took the end off
the top o' her finger.

07:07.020 --> 07:11.052
Well, she grabbed it out its cage,
and the two of them were brawling.

07:11.052 --> 07:13.044
Bird versus Auntie.

07:13.044 --> 07:17.088
And all the time Sadie's shouting,
"Up your ...kin' hole!"

07:17.088 --> 07:19.068
Oh, my.

07:19.068 --> 07:22.000
Oh, here, that wee parakeet.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.012
It could talk like a budgie,

07:24.012 --> 07:28.080
Talk, talk, talk, talk,
talk, talk, talk.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.032
Where's Jack and Victor?

07:33.048 --> 07:34.088
Out walking.

07:34.088 --> 07:36.032
Training for Sunday.

07:37.084 --> 07:39.092
Do you think they'll manage up it?

07:39.092 --> 07:42.020
I don't know. I'll tell you one
thing -

07:42.020 --> 07:45.032
they'll manage down it all right -
in a rescue copter.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.060
Silly bastards.

07:47.060 --> 07:52.052
I was up gonnae climb Ben Lomond
wi' some pals when I was 18.

07:52.052 --> 07:54.084
But I met a German lassie
at base camp.

07:56.008 --> 07:59.060
She had two Ben Lomonds,
so I decided to conquer them.

08:01.032 --> 08:04.056
Aye, the old rescue chopper
was out that night!

08:05.060 --> 08:06.064
Is that true?

08:06.064 --> 08:08.056
Naw. She was fae Paisley.

08:10.016 --> 08:11.096
They'll end up deid.

08:11.096 --> 08:14.016
What would be so bad about that?

08:14.016 --> 08:15.084
What a way to go, eh?

08:15.084 --> 08:18.036
Venturing into the unknown
at their age.

08:18.036 --> 08:20.076
See if I had two legs?
I'd be going wi' them.

08:20.076 --> 08:24.036
Oh, no, no, no. There was a boy went
up last year wi' no legs.

08:24.036 --> 08:26.084
It was in the paper.Really?

08:26.084 --> 08:28.076
So you've got no excuse
for no' going.

08:28.076 --> 08:29.084
What's your excuse?

08:31.068 --> 08:33.011
I have a wife.

08:33.011 --> 08:38.028
If anything was to happen to me, I
would leave a grieving woman behind.

08:38.028 --> 08:39.052
He's got a wife.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.092
You faked your own death
a couple of months ago

08:42.092 --> 08:45.012
to collect your own insurance,
you arsehole.

08:45.012 --> 08:46.084
That's true, I forgot about that.

08:46.084 --> 08:50.012
Well, OK, then, I'll go if you go.

08:50.012 --> 08:51.084
Right, you're on.

08:51.084 --> 08:53.052
What's your excuse, Boabby?

08:53.052 --> 08:56.052
Well, that's yous going on Sunday.
I cannae, I've got the pub.

08:57.068 --> 08:59.016
Well, who comes in here on a Sunday?

08:59.016 --> 09:02.092
Well, yous two, Jack, Victor.

09:05.056 --> 09:07.012
I'll dig my boots out.

09:07.012 --> 09:09.016
Yeah. That's the spirit.

09:09.016 --> 09:12.040
As a matter of fact,
I should be there.

09:12.040 --> 09:16.076
If things turn ugly, you'll need
a cool heid on square shoulders.

09:18.068 --> 09:20.088
A Liam Neeson type.

09:20.088 --> 09:22.036
Someone with a...

09:22.036 --> 09:24.060
AS LIAM NEESON:..certain set
of skills.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.084
He's right.

09:27.084 --> 09:29.044
We should ask Isa to come.

09:29.044 --> 09:31.036
DOOR OPENS

09:31.036 --> 09:33.048
Oh, look who it is.

09:33.048 --> 09:35.076
Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing.

09:36.092 --> 09:38.032
That's actually very good, Boabby.

09:38.032 --> 09:40.036
Cos that's the two fellas
that conquered Everest.

09:40.036 --> 09:42.044
Aye, you finally got one right.

09:42.044 --> 09:43.072
Aye, well done.

09:43.072 --> 09:47.004
That aside...
BOTH:Two pints, prick.

09:48.040 --> 09:51.020
Here, do you want the good news
or the bad news?

09:51.020 --> 09:52.080
Eh, good news.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.028
We're coming wi' you.

09:54.028 --> 09:56.060
Brilliant, eh?Aye.

09:56.060 --> 09:57.084
Bad news?

09:57.084 --> 09:59.044
Boabby's coming too.

09:59.044 --> 10:00.096
Oh, are you?

10:00.096 --> 10:03.052
That's bad news, eh?

10:03.052 --> 10:05.044
Look at you.

10:05.044 --> 10:09.060
An ant that looks like
a cuddly wee panda.

10:09.060 --> 10:11.008
But still an ant.

10:11.008 --> 10:14.020
Look at your big, beautiful eyes

10:14.020 --> 10:17.024
and all your wee mad furry legs.

10:17.024 --> 10:19.084
A wee bit creepy, that, but, hey...

10:19.084 --> 10:22.044
But you still need my help.

10:22.044 --> 10:24.000
"Would you like to donate?"

10:24.000 --> 10:25.012
CashBuddy.

10:25.012 --> 10:26.096
Password.

10:28.004 --> 10:29.080
Let's see...

10:29.080 --> 10:33.020
"Aggie Taylor says she's losing
weight naturally

10:33.020 --> 10:35.084
"but I've heard it's a gastric band.

10:35.084 --> 10:38.040
"36."

10:40.008 --> 10:42.076
Insufficient funds?

10:45.016 --> 10:47.076
Right...

10:47.076 --> 10:49.016
It's ringing.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.032
RINGING

10:51.032 --> 10:53.036
Oh! Look at that.

10:53.036 --> 10:55.020
Oh, hello, boys.

10:55.020 --> 10:56.048
Hello, Shug.

10:56.048 --> 11:00.012
It's Jack, Victor, Winston
and Tam.O-ho!

11:01.028 --> 11:02.060
Hello, Shug!

11:02.060 --> 11:04.020
Boabby! You're upside down.

11:04.020 --> 11:06.040
Where are you at the moment, Shug?

11:06.040 --> 11:09.016
Oh, Bondi Beach.
Another cover shoot.

11:09.016 --> 11:12.012
So you're upside down!
LAUGHS

11:13.024 --> 11:14.048
Cos...

11:14.048 --> 11:15.088
Cos it's Australia.

11:16.088 --> 11:18.028
Very good, Boabby.

11:18.028 --> 11:19.092
That's you a global prick now.

11:21.016 --> 11:22.076
Did we wake you up, Shug?

11:22.076 --> 11:25.012
No, no, no, it's...it's breakfast
time.

11:25.012 --> 11:26.084
So, what are you wanting?

11:26.084 --> 11:29.068
Eh, there's a bunch of us
going up Ben Lomond.

11:29.068 --> 11:31.012
We were looking for advice.

11:31.012 --> 11:33.060
Check the weather.
Weather's fine.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.040
All right. You got all the kit?

11:35.040 --> 11:39.040
I was just gonnae wear my shorts
and a T-shirt and flip-flops.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.024
Very funny, Fatty.

11:41.024 --> 11:44.092
Start taking this seriously
or I'm hanging up.

11:44.092 --> 11:46.052
Sorry, Shug.

11:46.052 --> 11:47.080
Aye. So you've no kit?

11:47.080 --> 11:49.080
No.All right.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.060
There's a pub at the bottom
of Ben Lomond.

11:51.060 --> 11:53.000
The Rambler's Retreat.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.064
You go in there.

11:54.064 --> 11:58.032
You wade past all the English
arseholes and ask for Rab.

11:58.032 --> 12:00.060
And he'll sort you out
wi' all the good kit.

12:00.060 --> 12:03.016
And it's all my kit,
so you'll get it for nothing.

12:03.016 --> 12:04.080
Yes!

12:05.096 --> 12:07.016
Sorry, Shug.

12:07.016 --> 12:08.032
Aye, he'll get you everything.

12:08.032 --> 12:13.048
You know, sticks, compass, tent,
all that essential bollocks.

12:13.048 --> 12:17.004
WOMAN:Talking about essential bollocks,
are you coming back to bed?

12:19.096 --> 12:22.056
Was that Edith, Shug?

12:22.056 --> 12:24.036
Yes.

12:24.036 --> 12:26.072
Are you sharing a room?

12:28.052 --> 12:29.080
Yes.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.096
ALL LAUGH KNOWINGLY

12:34.000 --> 12:35.024
Sorry, Shug.

12:38.020 --> 12:39.056
That's him away.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.052
Well, did you get it?What?

12:43.052 --> 12:45.080
Cos Australia's upside down!

12:51.080 --> 12:53.024
Isa, what are you doing?

12:53.024 --> 12:55.024
Just a wee bit of tidying.

12:55.024 --> 12:58.004
You're making me feel like Julia
Roberts in Sleeping With The Enemy.

12:58.004 --> 12:59.072
What is with the OCD pish?

12:59.072 --> 13:01.060
Your shift ended ten minutes ago.

13:01.060 --> 13:04.044
I've been building up
to ask you something.

13:04.044 --> 13:06.032
I need an advance.

13:06.032 --> 13:08.044
Naw. Have a nice evening.

13:08.044 --> 13:10.068
Oh, right.

13:10.068 --> 13:11.088
Hold on, Isa.

13:11.088 --> 13:14.028
You've never asked for an advance.

13:14.028 --> 13:15.064
Have you got a problem?

13:15.064 --> 13:17.020
Oh, I do, aye.

13:17.020 --> 13:18.088
But it's a wee bit embarrassing.

13:18.088 --> 13:21.096
You need money to
buy women's-problems creams?

13:21.096 --> 13:23.068
No!

13:25.064 --> 13:28.004
What's your position on charity?

13:28.004 --> 13:29.008
Charity?

13:29.008 --> 13:32.012
Charity begins at home. My home.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.032
That's my problem.

13:34.032 --> 13:36.052
I'm in deep wi' the charities.

13:36.052 --> 13:38.008
I'm charity daft.

13:38.008 --> 13:39.068
A charity-holic.

13:39.068 --> 13:43.008
I'm into them for £250 a month.

13:43.008 --> 13:44.084
A charity junkie?Exactly.

13:44.084 --> 13:47.008
Oh, I'm rattling, Navid.

13:47.008 --> 13:49.040
I get a buzz out my fix.

13:49.040 --> 13:53.000
I'm a baw-hair away fae hawking
my silver cutlery to fund my habit.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.032
I need help!

13:55.032 --> 13:57.064
-

13:58.092 --> 14:00.032
Give us 40 quid.

14:00.032 --> 14:01.036
Out that till the now.

14:01.036 --> 14:03.092
It's nothing to you,
you've got plenty.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.032
You don't need money.

14:05.032 --> 14:06.068
You need an intervention.

14:06.068 --> 14:08.008
Please, Navid!

14:15.016 --> 14:16.020
TILL PINGS

14:23.084 --> 14:25.064
Twix, please.

14:25.064 --> 14:28.012
Oh...animals?

14:28.012 --> 14:30.028
Is it animals?It is, aye.

14:30.028 --> 14:32.024
Isa, no!
What kind of animals?

14:32.024 --> 14:33.092
Korean porpoises. Look.

14:33.092 --> 14:36.076
Oh, look at its wee face!

14:36.076 --> 14:38.088
There's 20 quid.

14:38.088 --> 14:41.036
That'll save a wee porpoise.

14:43.004 --> 14:46.088
There's another 20,
in case it's got a porpoise pal.

14:46.088 --> 14:48.032
Oh!

14:52.064 --> 14:54.068
CLATTERING

15:00.036 --> 15:03.004
So, how do you know Shug?

15:05.016 --> 15:06.048
I cannae answer that.

15:07.076 --> 15:09.080
You've no' got the clearance.

15:11.008 --> 15:13.068
Oh, aye. Well, enough said, aye.

15:13.068 --> 15:15.048
I'll tell you this one thing.

15:17.004 --> 15:18.092
Maryhill barracks.

15:18.092 --> 15:20.036
We were young.

15:20.036 --> 15:22.084
There was this right bastard
in our squad.

15:22.084 --> 15:24.048
McKenna.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.064
Fancied himself.

15:26.064 --> 15:27.088
A bully.

15:29.004 --> 15:33.020
Shug had just finished reading
The Murder On The Orient Express.

15:34.072 --> 15:36.048
So that's what we done.

15:38.028 --> 15:39.056
You murdered him?

15:39.056 --> 15:41.044
Naw.

15:42.064 --> 15:44.092
We waited till midnight.

15:44.092 --> 15:47.072
McKenna was snoring the bit out.

15:47.072 --> 15:51.064
So we all rose fae our beds
like ninjas.

15:53.020 --> 15:56.068
Each squaddie put a bar of soap
inside a sock,

15:56.068 --> 15:59.084
and we took it in turns
to set about him.

15:59.084 --> 16:03.048
One of the boys saw him
a couple of years back.

16:03.048 --> 16:06.012
Cannae eat anything unless
it's liquid.

16:07.064 --> 16:10.012
He never bullied anybody again.

16:12.096 --> 16:16.040
We all took a vow never to speak
of it.

16:20.012 --> 16:21.084
And I've just went and telt yous!

16:23.012 --> 16:25.028
What am I like?

16:25.028 --> 16:29.020
That's what a couple of Johnnie Walkers
in the afternoon'll do to you!

16:31.012 --> 16:34.072
And then another time...
That's plenty!

16:36.028 --> 16:39.048
Listen, you're no' planning on going
up the Ben the morra, are you?

16:39.048 --> 16:41.048
SLURPS

16:41.048 --> 16:42.064
Aye.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.080
Ah. Well, I don't think that's
a good idea.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.052
You're out of season.

16:48.052 --> 16:51.048
Have you checked the weather
forecast for the morra?

16:51.048 --> 16:52.068
It can turn on a tanner.

16:55.060 --> 16:57.036
Rab...

16:57.036 --> 16:59.036
We can handle ourselves.

16:59.036 --> 17:01.040
I mean, don't get me wrong.

17:01.040 --> 17:04.008
Not one of us has ever put a bar of
soap in a sock

17:04.008 --> 17:06.028
and leathered a boy doolally wi' it,

17:06.028 --> 17:09.056
but we're no' soft Yankee tourists,
either.

17:09.056 --> 17:12.056
Naw! We're city men.

17:12.056 --> 17:14.031
Clydebuilt.

17:16.088 --> 17:18.048
These aren't bones.

17:18.048 --> 17:19.068
They're girders.

17:22.048 --> 17:23.068
Watch this.

17:29.040 --> 17:32.036
THUMP
Ah! You dozy bastard,

17:32.036 --> 17:33.096
that's the real one!

17:33.096 --> 17:35.028
WAILS

17:37.088 --> 17:40.020
Isa. We've been at this
for two hours

17:40.020 --> 17:42.044
and you've only let me unsubscribe
from one charity.

17:42.044 --> 17:43.088
The Blob Fish.

17:43.088 --> 17:45.068
I liked its wee face, too.

17:47.004 --> 17:50.040
Back to the top.
Giant Chinese salamander?

17:50.040 --> 17:51.080
No!

17:51.080 --> 17:54.048
Anteaters?No.

17:54.048 --> 17:56.088
Ants?
No. I mean, well,

17:56.088 --> 17:58.092
what would the anteaters eat?

17:58.092 --> 18:01.028
Chips? Kit Kats? I don't know.

18:01.028 --> 18:04.012
Solomon Island glowing sea turtle?

18:04.012 --> 18:06.048
Not on your nelly.

18:06.048 --> 18:08.052
They light up, Navid!

18:09.084 --> 18:12.080
Australian punk rock monkey?

18:12.080 --> 18:14.020
No.

18:14.020 --> 18:16.040
They gave me this!

18:16.040 --> 18:18.088
These animals need me, Navid!

18:18.088 --> 18:20.024
I need a cup of tea.

18:20.024 --> 18:22.000
I've no tea bags.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.028
Or milk.

18:23.028 --> 18:24.064
Point proven.

18:24.064 --> 18:26.052
Will you take a glass of water?

18:26.052 --> 18:28.060
Aye, sure.

18:39.092 --> 18:41.084
You monster!

18:41.084 --> 18:43.076
Do you know what you've done?

18:45.060 --> 18:47.048
That's what you've done!

18:47.048 --> 18:48.068
KNOCK AT DOOR

18:54.032 --> 18:55.064
It's all over, Isa.

18:55.064 --> 18:57.072
You're clean. We've done them all.

18:58.076 --> 19:00.008
We've no' done them all.

19:07.084 --> 19:10.016
PANTING: Here, I'm starving.

19:10.016 --> 19:11.024
Don't worry.

19:11.024 --> 19:13.096
As soon as we get the fire going
and the tent up,

19:13.096 --> 19:17.040
I shall prepare us a feast.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.016
Is this the campsite?

19:19.016 --> 19:21.056
No, cannae be, it's a car park.

19:21.056 --> 19:23.044
Well, can we no' pitch the tent
here?

19:24.040 --> 19:29.012
I'll give you my watch if you can hammer
one tent peg into that concrete.

19:29.012 --> 19:30.032
You're an idiot!

19:30.032 --> 19:32.096
Here, where is the campsite?

19:32.096 --> 19:35.000
Well, it must be round here
somewhere.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.064
Aye, thanks, Bear Grylls.

19:36.064 --> 19:38.048
Here, where's Jack away to?

19:38.048 --> 19:40.040
Oh, no! Here, Jack, don't.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.060
Listen!

19:51.088 --> 19:53.052
Can I help you?
Eh, hello, aye.

19:53.052 --> 19:57.024
There's a campsite round about here.
Would you know where that is?

19:57.024 --> 19:58.064
No.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.068
Right.

19:59.068 --> 20:01.008
Is that us?

20:01.008 --> 20:02.068
Yes, uh-huh.

20:07.020 --> 20:09.016
KNOCKS

20:10.040 --> 20:13.092
It's just that me and my pals are gonnae be
climbing Ben Lomond in the morning.

20:13.092 --> 20:15.016
Good for you.

20:15.016 --> 20:16.088
Have you been up it yourself?

20:16.088 --> 20:20.004
I'm trying to get up it the now,
but you keep interrupting.

20:20.004 --> 20:21.028
Oh!
STAMMERS

20:21.028 --> 20:23.008
I beg your pardon. As you were.

20:28.068 --> 20:30.036
Right, which way are we going?

20:30.036 --> 20:32.024
You'll never guess what that couple
in that car were...

20:32.024 --> 20:35.048
We know. Move.
Stop shoving.

20:37.052 --> 20:39.040
So, is that the bastard there?

20:39.040 --> 20:41.028
That's him, aye.

20:44.072 --> 20:45.092
Hello.

20:45.092 --> 20:48.060
Hello. Do you want to
sponsor a bird?

20:48.060 --> 20:50.024
I want to cancel a bird.

20:50.024 --> 20:51.072
See that woman there?

20:51.072 --> 20:53.016
She bought a bird

20:53.016 --> 20:55.012
and she cannae afford it.
You mean sponsored?

20:55.012 --> 20:56.084
Bought, sponsored, rented.

20:56.084 --> 20:58.048
It disnae matter, bawbag.

21:00.040 --> 21:03.032
That woman, that angel,

21:03.032 --> 21:04.092
that is Isa Drennan.

21:04.092 --> 21:08.040
Through the kindness of her heart,
and the softness of her brain,

21:08.040 --> 21:13.020
she has been pledging £250 a month
to animals around the world.

21:13.020 --> 21:16.092
Now, I've managed to cancel all of
the subscriptions apart from yours.

21:16.092 --> 21:19.016
Ah, see, you need to go on
to the website to do that.

21:19.016 --> 21:22.016
Your website
is like a pile of spaghetti.

21:22.016 --> 21:23.084
It is like the Gordian Knot.

21:23.084 --> 21:25.084
It is like Crystal bastard Maze!

21:25.084 --> 21:27.084
I know. Clever, in't it?

21:27.084 --> 21:29.044
Cancel it.Cannae.

21:30.064 --> 21:32.028
Let me take the payment, then.

21:32.028 --> 21:34.072
Now that I can do.

21:34.072 --> 21:38.028
Now, are you still wanting
your lovebird to be called Isa?

21:38.028 --> 21:39.056
Yes.

21:39.056 --> 21:40.076
OK.

21:47.068 --> 21:49.092
Oh, bugger it.
Give me another one.

21:49.092 --> 21:51.096
Another one?

21:51.096 --> 21:53.032
No worries.

21:53.032 --> 21:54.048
You got a name in mind?

21:54.048 --> 21:55.076
Navid.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.076
OK, sign here.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.088
Make like I'm tearing you
a new arsehole.

22:06.088 --> 22:08.068
MOUTHS

22:14.076 --> 22:16.040
Did you sort it out?

22:16.040 --> 22:18.036
Big time.

22:18.036 --> 22:21.044
I'm taking you to the Clansman
for a drink.

22:21.044 --> 22:22.080
You know I don't drink.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.084
Lemonade on the rocks.

22:28.024 --> 22:29.076
OWL HOOTS

22:32.092 --> 22:34.056
LAUGHS

22:34.056 --> 22:36.076
Do you think we'll all
get in that tent?

22:36.076 --> 22:38.032
ALL LAUGH
I would think so, aye.

22:38.032 --> 22:40.088
It's as big as the Lidl
on Brookstone Road.

22:40.088 --> 22:43.020
Here, what are we eating?

22:43.020 --> 22:44.048
Ah.

22:50.008 --> 22:52.056
There we are.
There's no labels on these.

22:52.056 --> 22:55.088
They've been that long in the back
of my cupboards, they've disintegrated.

22:55.088 --> 22:57.056
Aye, but we don't know what's in
them.

22:57.056 --> 23:00.008
Well, where's your spirit
of adventure?

23:00.008 --> 23:02.052
CHUCKLES

23:02.052 --> 23:04.064
Right, come on, we'll try
this one first.

23:10.056 --> 23:13.008
So, what's everybody got?

23:13.008 --> 23:15.040
Chickpeas in brine.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.064
Yummy.

23:18.004 --> 23:19.032
Here, this is dog food.

23:20.056 --> 23:22.040
That tin must be 20 year old.

23:22.040 --> 23:24.032
That's when my wee dug Sammy died.

23:25.044 --> 23:28.096
I've got kidney beans here, I think.

23:28.096 --> 23:30.068
Are you gonnae eat them?

23:30.068 --> 23:33.036
Not unless you want to do the
campfire scene from Blazing Saddles.

23:35.048 --> 23:36.072
What have you got, Jack?

23:36.072 --> 23:37.092
Paint.

23:37.092 --> 23:39.036
Oh, what colour?

23:39.036 --> 23:41.040
Red. What does it matter?

23:41.040 --> 23:44.012
What do you want me to do, hold my
nose and make out it's tomato soup?

23:44.012 --> 23:47.044
Well, you could put the kidney beans
in wi' the chickpeas

23:47.044 --> 23:49.096
and then pour in the paint
and make a chilli.

23:51.008 --> 23:52.024
I've eaten worse.

23:52.024 --> 23:53.084
Shh, shh!
ANIMAL CALLS AND RUSTLING

23:53.084 --> 23:55.004
What was that?

23:57.012 --> 23:59.084
Calm doon,
there's no wildlife round here.

23:59.084 --> 24:01.004
It'll be a sheep or something.

24:01.004 --> 24:02.056
Aye, aye, aye.

24:02.056 --> 24:06.000
Well, we'll put a stick up its arse, and
barbecue the bastard, how about that?

24:06.000 --> 24:08.080
RUSTLING
Woo-oo-oo!

24:08.080 --> 24:10.032
ALL YELL
Hello, boys!

24:10.032 --> 24:12.048
Oh, Jesus, it's Isa.

24:12.048 --> 24:14.040
Still want to do
that stick barbecue thing?

24:14.040 --> 24:16.032
And Navid.

24:16.032 --> 24:18.004
Ah, you're in the wrong place.

24:18.004 --> 24:20.000
The dogging happens down
the car park.

24:23.016 --> 24:26.024
Isa, what the bloody hell
are you doing here?

24:26.024 --> 24:31.004
The Clansman was shut.
Made a few enquiries.

24:31.004 --> 24:33.040
Bingo.
Have you any food wi' you?

24:33.040 --> 24:35.040
Naw.
Would you like a bowl of chilli?

24:35.040 --> 24:36.088
ALL LAUGH

24:36.088 --> 24:40.012
Here, yous aren't gonnae
climb Ben Lomond, are yous?

24:40.012 --> 24:41.040
Naw.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.096
Oh, here, neither should yous!

24:42.096 --> 24:45.060
The weather's no' to be good
the morra.

24:45.060 --> 24:47.012
Guys, Isa's right.

24:47.012 --> 24:49.032
I don't think any of us
are going up there the morra.

24:49.032 --> 24:51.024
It looks like it's gonnae turn.

24:52.040 --> 24:54.032
Well, that's that, then, eh?

24:54.032 --> 24:56.020
Ach, there's always next year.

24:56.020 --> 24:58.040
Aye, next year, aye.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.084
That's if any of us are still here
next year.

25:00.084 --> 25:02.060
Of course we'll be here next year.

25:02.060 --> 25:05.048
None of us are going anywhere.

25:05.048 --> 25:06.076
Just like that mountain.

25:08.008 --> 25:11.048
Ach, we're no' needing
to go up any mountain.

25:11.048 --> 25:13.084
This is where the party's at!

25:13.084 --> 25:15.064
ALL CHEER

25:15.064 --> 25:16.092
Agreed?

25:18.044 --> 25:20.048
Well, Winston's definitely no'
going up.

25:20.048 --> 25:21.056
Look.

25:21.056 --> 25:23.076
Oh!

25:23.076 --> 25:26.028
You bastard!

25:26.028 --> 25:29.008
YELLS

25:51.068 --> 25:53.076
SIGHS

25:55.092 --> 25:57.060
Disnae look too bad up there,
does it, Jack?

25:58.076 --> 26:00.012
No, it doesn't.

26:01.032 --> 26:03.016
Lovely day for a descension.

26:04.036 --> 26:06.004
Ascension.

26:06.004 --> 26:07.044
What did I say?

26:09.068 --> 26:11.000
Disnae matter.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.048
Should I, er...?

26:19.040 --> 26:20.048
Come on.

26:30.032 --> 26:32.008
JACK: Did you bring any water wi'
you?

26:32.008 --> 26:33.028
Naw.

26:34.072 --> 26:37.068
But I did fill my hip flask
with the last of Isa's bottle.

26:37.068 --> 26:39.060
JACK CHUCKLES

26:39.060 --> 26:42.020
Do you think they'll be
wondering where we went?

26:42.020 --> 26:44.096
Nah. They'll know where we went.

26:48.060 --> 26:51.092
MUSIC: "Don't Think Twice, It's
Alright" by Bob Dylan

26:54.044 --> 26:58.068
# Well, it ain't no use
to sit and wonder why, babe

27:00.052 --> 27:02.080
# If'n you don't know by now

27:04.012 --> 27:07.072
# And it ain't no use to sit
and wonder why, babe

27:09.044 --> 27:11.056
# It'll never do somehow

27:12.072 --> 27:16.088
# When your rooster crows
at the break of dawn

27:17.096 --> 27:21.096
# Look out your window
and I'll be gone

27:21.096 --> 27:25.040
# You're the reason
I'm a-travelling on

27:26.036 --> 27:29.020
# But don't think twice,
it's all right

27:43.076 --> 27:46.080
# So long honey, baby

27:47.084 --> 27:50.096
# Where I'm bound,
I can't tell

27:52.064 --> 27:55.092
# Goodbye's too good a word, babe

27:57.032 --> 27:59.048
# So I'll just say fare thee well

28:01.008 --> 28:05.044
# I ain't a-saying
you treated me unkind

28:05.044 --> 28:09.016
# You could have done better
but I don't mind

28:09.016 --> 28:13.060
# You just kinda wasted
my precious time

28:13.060 --> 28:16.024
# But don't think twice,
it's all right...

28:17.020 --> 28:18.044
Well...

28:20.040 --> 28:22.028
Look who it isnae.
