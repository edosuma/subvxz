00:02.000 --> 00:04.480
Have you fixed that squeaky gate
yet? Not yet, Mrs McCarthy.

00:04.480 --> 00:06.480
Well, chop, chop.

00:06.480 --> 00:08.840
How are we getting on?
You're doing a lovely job.

00:08.840 --> 00:12.400
That's nice.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.200
Mrs Simpson.

00:14.200 --> 00:17.720
Yes, Mrs McCarthy.
A dandelion. OK, I'll sort it.

00:19.680 --> 00:22.800
Mr Gracy? Clear that up.

00:27.720 --> 00:31.920
Now, Father, is this bench
going to be dry in time...

00:31.920 --> 00:34.440
Oh, Mrs Banks.

00:34.440 --> 00:38.800
I was just telling Mrs Banks about
our recent spate of vandalism.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.240
Don't get me started.

00:41.240 --> 00:45.520
I only hope that the hoodlums are
caught before our judges arrive,

00:45.520 --> 00:48.840
otherwise all our efforts
will be in vain.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.760
I'm so sorry.
If I'd known you were coming...

00:55.760 --> 01:01.040
It's fine. So what do we get
if we win this "Best Kept Village"?

01:01.040 --> 01:05.360
We get the satisfaction of living in
a place we can be very proud of.

01:05.360 --> 01:08.040
Not to mention beating Hambleston.

01:08.040 --> 01:11.320
Ah. So nothing, then.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.640
No. It can't be.

01:53.640 --> 01:55.280
Mrs Banks.

01:55.280 --> 01:58.400
Sidney. Go with her.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.880
What is he doing here?

02:00.880 --> 02:03.080
I'll have a word.

02:05.480 --> 02:10.880
Ned. You ought not to be here.
I've told you, now get gone.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.240
Good riddance is all I can say.

02:13.240 --> 02:17.720
All right, the show is over.
Come on, everyone, back to work.

02:48.480 --> 02:52.080
Dad, there's three motors out there
need doing by lunchtime.

02:54.160 --> 02:56.040
Forget it.

02:56.040 --> 02:58.840
Daniel?
What's happened?

02:58.840 --> 03:00.720
She's had a bit of a shock.

03:00.720 --> 03:04.400
Ned Hannigan. He's in the village.
Ah, Dad. Don't be stupid.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.720
Stay with your mum.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.240
I'll go.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.080
Which emergency service
do you require? Police.

03:21.080 --> 03:24.000
Someone's about to get hurt.

03:25.320 --> 03:27.240
I don't need an escort, Father.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.480
I have a duty of care
to all my parishioners.

03:30.480 --> 03:31.880
Where will you go?

03:31.880 --> 03:33.640
Somewhere no-one knows my name.

03:33.640 --> 03:37.120
I think you'll be surprised at how
many people do know your name.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.520
The Maggie Banks case
was national news.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.360
So I'm famous.Infamous, perhaps.

03:41.360 --> 03:44.200
Where is she?
John, come on, mate.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.560
Last chance, Hannigan.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.440
Tell me where she is
or you're a dead man.

03:47.440 --> 03:48.640
Mr Banks, put that down.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.800
He has to tell me where he hid my
daughter's body.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.240
HORN HONKS

03:58.720 --> 04:00.360
No!

04:02.600 --> 04:04.800
No! Oh...

04:04.800 --> 04:06.600
All right, you two, break it up.

04:06.600 --> 04:07.840
That's enough.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.200
You be quiet, you're good at that.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.400
All right.
You're coming down the station.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.200
Inspector Mallory.
Just look. Ruined!

04:15.200 --> 04:19.280
Do you have any idea how much time,
how much effort,

04:19.280 --> 04:21.560
not to mention the expense?

04:21.560 --> 04:24.520
Perhaps we could discuss this later,
Mrs McCarthy?

04:26.040 --> 04:29.000
Right. Let's get that cleaned up.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.800
I was just a kid
when I was arrested.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.880
14 years inside, not one fight.

04:40.880 --> 04:44.080
Out five minutes and this happens.

04:44.080 --> 04:47.680
I'm not one to condone violence,

04:47.680 --> 04:51.200
but the Banks family
have suffered a great deal.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.840
Thought I could slip in
without anyone seeing me.

04:59.840 --> 05:02.080
Didn't expect half the village
to be there.

05:03.760 --> 05:06.800
I didn't mean to upset anyone.

05:06.800 --> 05:10.800
And yet you continue to withhold
the whereabouts

05:10.800 --> 05:12.880
of Maggie Banks's body.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.680
I don't understand.

05:15.960 --> 05:18.480
It's not too late.
I could hear your confession.

05:18.480 --> 05:21.560
I already confessed.
I've been punished.

05:21.560 --> 05:25.520
You confessed to the police.
What about God?

05:25.520 --> 05:29.800
Have you asked Him for forgiveness
for the sake of your immortal soul?

05:29.800 --> 05:33.600
Look, I'm late. I've got to go.
Thanks for that.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.400
Late for what?

05:38.040 --> 05:39.160
Wait.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.960
Where is he?

05:48.960 --> 05:51.000
Ah, morning, Inspector.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.080
I'm afraid I don't know.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.280
Mr Hannigan has taken his leave.

05:55.280 --> 05:58.800
Good. Let's hope that's
the last we see of him.

06:20.440 --> 06:23.680
The orphanage sent him
to work on Mr Gracy's farm.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.920
Boarding out, they called it.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.480
Child labour, I call it.

06:28.480 --> 06:33.200
Whatever. Anyway, apparently at some
point he got friendly

06:33.200 --> 06:34.440
with Maggie Banks.

06:34.440 --> 06:38.160
Then one day they went off together
and she never came home.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.360
What happened?

06:39.360 --> 06:43.160
Nobody really knows.
Police found blood in the woods,

06:43.160 --> 06:45.280
and on Ned Hannigan's jacket.

06:45.280 --> 06:49.720
But from the moment he was arrested
he never said a word.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.920
Except to plead guilty to murder.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.720
They were dark days
for Kembleford.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.680
Best left in the past.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.400
Oh, all that needs clearing up.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.000
Where is Mr Gracy?

07:03.840 --> 07:05.920
Well, isn't that just perfect.

07:05.920 --> 07:07.440
Disappeared.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.480
Daniel.

07:11.480 --> 07:14.880
Is my Dad with you?
No. Police took him to cool off.

07:14.880 --> 07:18.200
Although I'd have thought he'd been
released by now.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.800
Oh. Speak of the devil.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.880
Where have you been?
Where's your mum? Kitchen.

07:26.080 --> 07:27.160
Sorry about him.

07:27.160 --> 07:31.080
No. You've all been under
tremendous pressure.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.760
I better get back to work.
Loads on and it's just me, so...

07:33.760 --> 07:35.800
If you need a hand, let us know.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.800
I know my way around an engine.

07:37.800 --> 07:38.960
She's gone. What?

07:38.960 --> 07:41.280
Yeah, pan boiling over,
the back door's wide open.

07:41.280 --> 07:44.120
You're supposed to be looking after
her. Yeah, I've been working.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.840
If you hadn't left me to do
everything.

07:45.840 --> 07:49.760
Let's calm down.
She can't have gone far.

07:51.800 --> 07:55.080
Mrs Banks? Mrs Banks?

07:55.080 --> 07:58.920
Maybe we should head back.
They might have already found her.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.600
Mr Hannigan?

08:17.640 --> 08:20.040
Possible murder weapon here, sir.

08:21.240 --> 08:22.760
Bag it up.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.480
Could that be a fingerprint?

08:26.480 --> 08:27.760
Where?

08:27.760 --> 08:29.240
There.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.360
Somebody get me a magnifying glass.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.800
Yes, sir.

08:34.800 --> 08:38.040
What were you two doing out here
in the woods anyway?

08:41.240 --> 08:45.400
Right. Well, excuse us if we don't
shed any tears, won't you?

08:45.400 --> 08:48.400
Of course. However,
under the circumstances,

08:48.400 --> 08:51.040
I'm afraid I need to take your
fingerprints.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.720
For elimination purposes.

08:52.720 --> 08:54.240
Of course.

08:54.240 --> 08:55.840
And I have to ask, Mr Banks,

08:55.840 --> 08:59.000
where did you go after leaving
the police station this afternoon?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.040
Straight home.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.440
And that's when you realised
Mrs Banks was missing?

09:03.440 --> 09:05.880
We went immediately
to look for her.

09:05.880 --> 09:09.120
Thank you.
Your testimony is not required.

09:09.120 --> 09:12.120
And when you were looking
for Mrs Banks,

09:12.120 --> 09:14.000
did you see Mr Hannigan?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.200
No.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.720
Did you see anyone else?

09:17.720 --> 09:19.200
No.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.200
And when you returned,
Mrs Banks was here?

09:24.200 --> 09:26.240
You were here all along,
weren't you, love?

09:26.240 --> 09:28.280
I was in the greenhouse.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.240
I don't know why they didn't think
to look in there

09:31.240 --> 09:33.120
before getting all worked up.

09:33.120 --> 09:36.680
You left a pan boiling over
to go to the greenhouse?

09:36.680 --> 09:38.040
Yes. Silly me.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.880
I completely forgot about it.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.440
No harm done.

09:42.440 --> 09:46.000
Is there a reason
you're still here, Padre?

10:11.240 --> 10:14.600
After all that poor family
has been through,

10:14.600 --> 10:18.840
it should be little wonder if one
of them finally snapped.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.880
We mustn't jump to conclusions.

10:21.880 --> 10:26.160
Here, isn't it true that Mrs Banks
did time in the loony bin?

10:26.160 --> 10:29.680
She spent time in
a psychiatric hospital,

10:29.680 --> 10:31.200
if that's what you mean.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.920
I thought that's what I said.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.080
Look at this.

10:36.080 --> 10:39.600
There's an inscription in it.
"To Ned. From Gracy".

10:39.600 --> 10:44.280
So?Well, this was only published
last year.

10:44.280 --> 10:47.120
He surely hasn't stood by him
all this time?

10:49.200 --> 10:50.840
When he was here earlier,

10:50.840 --> 10:54.720
Mr Hannigan said that he was late
for something.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.080
For what, I wonder?
I don't know.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.520
But he clearly had
an appointment to keep.

10:59.520 --> 11:04.560
And Banks's garage isn't the only
property that borders the woods.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.400
Gracy's Farm.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.520
But Mr Gracy told him
to leave Kembleford.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.600
We all saw that with our own eyes.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.680
He told him to leave the church.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.840
We don't know what else was said.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.960
Thanks, Inspector.

11:26.960 --> 11:30.160
If we think of anything,
we'll let you know.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.440
I think they believed us.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.720
How often did you visit him?

11:54.720 --> 11:57.920
Couple of times a year maybe.
Kept it quiet, like.

11:57.920 --> 12:00.320
Didn't think people'd understand.

12:00.320 --> 12:04.560
At first I thought maybe
I could get him to talk.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.000
But he never did.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.640
He weren't a bad kid.

12:08.640 --> 12:12.280
I know how that sounds
after what he did.

12:12.280 --> 12:14.560
What was he like? Young Ned.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.520
He was easy going, sociable.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.120
Bit of a clown sometimes.

12:20.120 --> 12:24.120
He had his quiet days too, when
he was more serious, thoughtful.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.520
But he was always very polite.

12:26.520 --> 12:28.640
And he worked hard.

12:28.640 --> 12:32.480
Maggie Banks was smitten with him.

12:34.680 --> 12:37.160
You knew they were spending time
together?

12:37.160 --> 12:39.840
I did see 'em sneaking off.

12:39.840 --> 12:44.480
I didn't see no harm in it. If I'd
have known what was going to...

12:44.480 --> 12:47.920
It wasn't your fault.

12:47.920 --> 12:52.440
Yeah, well.
You tell John Banks that.

12:52.440 --> 12:56.560
The last time you visited him
was just before he was released?

12:56.560 --> 12:58.280
Yeah.

12:58.280 --> 13:01.000
Did you offer him
a place back here?

13:01.000 --> 13:04.120
No. He wouldn't have accepted
even if I had.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.760
He knew he could never come back.

13:06.760 --> 13:11.160
And yet he did.
What changed his mind?

13:11.160 --> 13:14.440
I've no idea.

13:14.440 --> 13:18.000
Do you know anyone who might have
arranged to meet him?

13:18.000 --> 13:21.360
No. As far as I know, I'm the only
one who ever visited him

13:21.360 --> 13:22.840
in 14 years.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.360
Except...

13:28.400 --> 13:30.680
Except?

13:30.680 --> 13:36.480
That last time I went, there was one
other name on the visitor's log.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.240
Daniel.

13:39.640 --> 13:41.280
Daniel Banks.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.240
SCREAM

13:48.200 --> 13:49.640
Mrs Banks?

13:49.640 --> 13:51.240
There. He was there.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.440
Who?

13:52.440 --> 13:53.840
Ned Hannigan.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.920
Maybe I should telephone
Dr Gilbert?

14:14.920 --> 14:16.480
No. Please.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.600
If anyone finds out about this,
they'll put me back in that...

14:19.600 --> 14:21.800
That place.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.560
Besides, if Daniel and John
are left alone together,

14:24.560 --> 14:26.000
who knows what'll happen?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.360
Why? Do they not get along?

14:28.360 --> 14:33.120
John's...stuck in the past.
In his grief.

14:33.120 --> 14:36.960
He can't see beyond it.
Daniel has no patience for it.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.720
But, then,

14:38.720 --> 14:41.720
he's never even cried
for his sister.

14:41.720 --> 14:46.800
Well, Grief affects us all
differently, I suppose.

14:46.800 --> 14:50.720
Daniel thinks we can all move on.

14:50.720 --> 14:53.680
Hannigan's dead.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.440
But his answers have died with him

14:56.440 --> 14:59.520
and I don't know how John's
going to cope with that.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.440
And you? How are you coping?

15:04.360 --> 15:06.600
Apart from seeing dead men?

15:08.720 --> 15:12.720
I found it helped
to plan the funeral.

15:12.720 --> 15:15.320
For when we finally found her.

15:15.320 --> 15:19.560
It made things feel more...real.

15:19.560 --> 15:23.960
I was going to fill the church
with flowers. Maggie loved flowers.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.680
I remember.

15:27.240 --> 15:32.080
I remember her picking the heads off
Mrs Fortesque's sunflowers.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.720
I suppose that's it now.

15:39.720 --> 15:43.320
There really won't be a funeral.

15:43.320 --> 15:47.480
I'm really sorry I wasn't a better
friend to you back then.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.360
When she passed.

15:49.360 --> 15:52.720
I suppose I just didn't know
what to say.

15:52.720 --> 15:58.200
But if there is anything I can do
now to make amends, anything at all.

16:03.640 --> 16:06.160
HORN HONKING

16:06.160 --> 16:09.080
Oi, road hog! Get out the way.

16:09.080 --> 16:11.600
Sidney! Mind Father Brown!

16:18.800 --> 16:20.480
What is it?

16:20.480 --> 16:24.040
Mrs Banks, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Ned Hannigan.

16:40.680 --> 16:43.320
It's open and shut, Padre.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.760
I don't want any interfering.

16:45.760 --> 16:48.040
Has she confessed?

16:48.040 --> 16:51.480
No.Then it's hardly open and shut.

16:51.480 --> 16:54.160
As a father, I'd happily turn
a blind eye.

16:54.160 --> 16:56.000
But, as a police officer,

16:56.000 --> 16:59.280
I have no choice
but to charge her with murder.

17:01.440 --> 17:04.000
Not that it's any of your business,

17:04.000 --> 17:07.240
but that fingerprint
on the victim's watch,

17:07.240 --> 17:09.720
made in his blood,

17:09.720 --> 17:11.920
it was hers.

17:13.120 --> 17:16.280
You know she has a history of...

17:16.280 --> 17:18.960
They won't hang her.

17:18.960 --> 17:22.960
Just send her back
to the nut house.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.240
I'd like to see her, please.

17:35.400 --> 17:39.240
I know how it looks, Father.

17:39.240 --> 17:41.560
But I didn't do it.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.240
Tell me what happened.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.920
I saw him through the window.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.240
Why did you run after him?

18:01.240 --> 18:03.160
I...

18:05.680 --> 18:08.160
I wanted to know if he was real.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.280
What happened in the woods?

18:52.120 --> 18:53.560
Mum?

19:02.040 --> 19:03.760
Did anyone see you?

19:03.760 --> 19:06.960
Right, come on. Let's get you home.

19:14.280 --> 19:19.320
He was dead when I found him,
I swear.

19:19.320 --> 19:22.000
I believe you.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.920
And I promise,

19:24.920 --> 19:27.680
I will get to the bottom of this.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.880
And about time. Well?

19:35.880 --> 19:38.840
She's been charged.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.440
I have to go back to the Presbytery

19:41.440 --> 19:44.960
for my weekly telephone call
with the Bishop.

19:44.960 --> 19:49.080
Sidney, would you be so good
as to arrange a visit

19:49.080 --> 19:51.000
with Mr Daniel Banks?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.520
OK.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.240
According to Mr Gracy,

19:54.240 --> 19:58.080
Dan visited Ned in prison shortly
before he was released.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.800
Why on earth would he do that?

19:59.800 --> 20:01.360
I don't know.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.320
But do you remember when we arrived
at the garage

20:04.320 --> 20:07.440
shortly before we knew
that Mrs Banks was missing?

20:07.440 --> 20:10.360
Yeah, I remember.
He was heading out.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.200
I assumed just to look for his dad.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.240
That's what I assumed.

20:14.240 --> 20:18.000
But what if what we saw
was him coming back.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Coming back from where?

20:20.000 --> 20:23.040
Is it possible
that Daniel Banks arranged

20:23.040 --> 20:26.840
to meet Ned Hannigan
on the day of his release?

20:26.840 --> 20:30.400
Is that why Ned came back
to Kembleford?

20:30.400 --> 20:32.240
Leave it with me.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.960
She grows for all
the flower shows, you know,

20:38.960 --> 20:41.400
Chelsea, Harrogate and so on.

20:41.400 --> 20:44.480
And she says she has far more
than they need,

20:44.480 --> 20:47.400
so with any luck, fingers crossed...

20:52.240 --> 20:55.000
Listening to him
going over and over it,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.880
where the blood was found, where
there was a sign of a struggle,

20:57.880 --> 20:59.400
where they were going to dig next.

20:59.400 --> 21:02.720
Year after year after year,
it was enough to drive anybody mad.

21:06.960 --> 21:09.320
I thought Hannigan being dead
would put an end to it,

21:09.320 --> 21:10.960
but it's just made things worse.

21:13.880 --> 21:17.680
Is it true you went to see him
in prison?

21:17.680 --> 21:19.120
Who told you that?

21:22.240 --> 21:25.440
Only once.
When I heard he was getting out.

21:25.440 --> 21:30.120
I didn't want him coming back here
upsetting Mum, winding Dad up.

21:30.120 --> 21:34.240
So what, you went to see him
to scare him off?

21:34.240 --> 21:37.320
I told him if he came back here,
my dad would kill him.

21:37.320 --> 21:39.600
I only meant to scare him,
I never thought...

21:43.040 --> 21:44.800
Listen, Dan.

21:44.800 --> 21:48.200
If there's something that
you know than can help your mum...

21:52.360 --> 21:55.600
Dad told Mallory he came straight
home from the police station.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.640
Right?

21:57.640 --> 21:59.800
I rang the station
an hour before that

21:59.800 --> 22:01.760
and they said he'd just left.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.400
It's a ten-minute walk.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.480
So where was he?

22:06.480 --> 22:07.880
I don't know.

22:07.880 --> 22:10.320
I went looking for him,
but the next time I saw him was

22:10.320 --> 22:12.560
when you were there and he came
walking out the woods.

22:18.280 --> 22:20.360
Nothing appears to be missing.

22:20.360 --> 22:23.680
Has any of this vandalism
taken place in Hambleston?

22:23.680 --> 22:27.000
No, as far as we're aware
it's been limited to Kembleford.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.360
I knew it. Sabotage.

22:30.400 --> 22:33.080
They're trying to jeopardise
our chances of winning

22:33.080 --> 22:35.200
the Best Kept Village.

22:35.200 --> 22:39.000
I'll take the theory
into consideration.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.760
Wait. Something has been taken.
A plate of my scones.

22:43.760 --> 22:46.000
They were there. Freshly baked.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.960
I'll get on to Scotland Yard
immediately.

22:48.960 --> 22:52.560
It appears we have a master criminal
on our hands, Goodfellow.

22:56.480 --> 22:57.800
Perhaps a cup of tea.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.360
Thank you.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.400
What's going on?

23:01.400 --> 23:04.480
Oh. When did that happen?

23:04.480 --> 23:06.280
Have you spoken to Daniel Banks?

23:06.280 --> 23:08.560
Yeah, but it's not him
you want to be talking to.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.800
It's his dad.

23:12.480 --> 23:15.560
I was just walking.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.880
In the woods?

23:17.880 --> 23:21.480
It's where I feel closest to her.

23:21.480 --> 23:25.760
For 14 years, I wondered what
I would do if he came back.

23:25.760 --> 23:30.080
How I would force him
to tell me where she is.

23:32.640 --> 23:37.200
Well, now it's happened, and
I realised how foolish that was.

23:38.800 --> 23:42.160
Because he's never
going to give her up.

23:42.160 --> 23:47.480
And then I knew there was one
last thing that I had to do.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.960
Start again.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.720
From the beginning,
every inch of the map,

23:55.720 --> 23:58.880
every section until I find her.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.080
And what if you don't?

24:02.080 --> 24:04.440
Oh, she's in there somewhere.

24:04.440 --> 24:06.680
Perhaps that is enough?

24:06.680 --> 24:09.080
And just leave her? No!

24:09.080 --> 24:14.160
It was my job to look after her
and I let her down.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.760
Because I wasn't paying
enough attention.

24:18.920 --> 24:22.200
What about the child you still have?

24:22.200 --> 24:26.080
He may be a man now
but he still needs you.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.840
Perhaps now more than ever.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.600
PHONE RINGS

24:30.600 --> 24:32.200
S'cuse me.

24:35.120 --> 24:37.200
Hello.

24:37.200 --> 24:40.240
Yes, that's right.
Banks's garage, yeah.

24:42.520 --> 24:45.120
Yeah, um, Tuesday's fine.

24:45.120 --> 24:46.560
Yeah.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.040
About noon.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.760
What if...

24:58.760 --> 25:02.320
Look. Mrs Simpson's contact
from Harrogate came good.

25:02.320 --> 25:03.880
Isn't it wonderful?

25:03.880 --> 25:06.600
Yes, remarkable.

25:06.600 --> 25:10.640
What if the reason Ned Hannigan
never revealed

25:10.640 --> 25:14.360
the location of the grave is that
he doesn't know where it is?

25:15.440 --> 25:17.120
OK.

25:17.120 --> 25:20.960
There are two key pieces
of evidence against Ned Hannigan.

25:20.960 --> 25:23.200
Mr Gracy's testimony that he saw him

25:23.200 --> 25:25.480
and Maggie Banks go into
the woods that morning.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.200
And the blood-stained jacket,

25:27.200 --> 25:29.680
that Mr Gracy found
in one of his barns.

25:29.680 --> 25:31.640
So it was Gracy's word
against Hannigan's?

25:31.640 --> 25:35.800
No, Ned Hannigan never claimed
to be innocent.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.360
He pled guilty in a court of law.

25:38.360 --> 25:42.640
But perhaps he took the blame
on behalf of somebody else.

25:42.640 --> 25:45.520
Somebody he was loyal to.

25:45.520 --> 25:49.000
The only person who ever showed him
any kindness.

25:58.560 --> 26:01.120
Inspector Mallory.

26:05.320 --> 26:09.120
I am here for an update on
the robbery at the Presbytery.

26:09.120 --> 26:10.480
Do you have suspects?

26:10.480 --> 26:14.080
Mrs McCarthy, it's not a robbery
if nothing was taken.

26:14.080 --> 26:16.360
My scones were taken.

26:16.360 --> 26:18.640
Nothing of value.

26:18.640 --> 26:21.440
Which were on one
of my best China plates.

26:21.440 --> 26:24.200
A family heirloom, as it happens.

26:24.200 --> 26:28.000
Now I am going to give you
a full description.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.160
Notebook.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.880
You've got five minutes.

26:47.880 --> 26:52.720
Right. You start that side,
I'll start this.

27:02.760 --> 27:05.080
Oh, there was just one other thing.

27:05.080 --> 27:08.720
The destruction of
the village flower display.

27:08.720 --> 27:11.880
An unfortunate accident
in the line of duty.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.880
Oh, indeed, and one I'm sure
you wouldn't want

27:14.880 --> 27:17.840
the Kembleford Gardeners'
Association to pay for.

27:17.840 --> 27:23.200
Now I have a breakdown here
of all the damaged plants

27:23.200 --> 27:27.800
and their estimated value,
which we can go through together.

27:27.800 --> 27:31.640
Oh, and I'm sure we can reach an
appropriate financial settlement.

27:31.640 --> 27:35.240
Mrs McCarthy, if you wish to make
a complaint in writing,

27:35.240 --> 27:36.920
then, please, be my guest.

27:36.920 --> 27:40.280
But I'm a very busy man with
a lot of important work to do

27:40.280 --> 27:41.920
and I really must insist...

27:41.920 --> 27:44.880
Oh, indeed, indeed.
Very busy, important.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.600
Thank you for your time.

27:57.920 --> 28:03.560
Men working on the farm swore that
Mr Gracy was there the entire day.

28:03.560 --> 28:04.920
So what does that mean?

28:04.920 --> 28:08.840
It means Ned Hannigan
killed Maggie Banks.

28:08.840 --> 28:12.520
And we are no closer to finding out
who killed Mr Hannigan.

28:12.520 --> 28:15.920
Well, someone's lying.
We've just got to figure out who.

28:19.920 --> 28:22.880
What on Earth is that?

28:22.880 --> 28:24.720
No idea.

28:24.720 --> 28:28.920
Apparently it was found in his
pocket at the time of his arrest.

28:28.920 --> 28:30.320
It was in his bag.

28:39.520 --> 28:41.080
Are they stars?

28:49.120 --> 28:50.520
Gemini.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.440
What if everyone is telling
the truth?

29:11.600 --> 29:14.320
Mr Hannigan?

29:14.320 --> 29:16.240
I want to talk to you.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.640
You'll find me at St Mary's Church.
I'll be waiting.

29:32.480 --> 29:35.320
FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING

29:39.000 --> 29:40.240
Ned.

29:46.120 --> 29:47.520
How did you know?

29:47.520 --> 29:49.880
I telephoned the orphanage
this afternoon.

29:49.880 --> 29:51.960
They confirmed my suspicions.

29:53.560 --> 29:58.760
Ned Hannigan had a twin brother,
Bryn Hannigan,

29:58.760 --> 30:01.840
who ran away after his brother
was boarded out.

30:01.840 --> 30:05.520
They looked for him, of course,
but they never found him.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.040
All these years,

30:11.040 --> 30:13.840
you're the first person
to figure it out.

30:13.840 --> 30:16.080
A few things gave you away.

30:16.080 --> 30:20.120
Starting with the bandage, when you
took the bandage off your hand

30:20.120 --> 30:23.600
and dressed your brother's,
you finished off with a knot.

30:25.240 --> 30:28.880
Now I was trained to tuck in,
not tie.

30:31.400 --> 30:32.880
And then there's your bag.

30:32.880 --> 30:35.680
It's under your seat, by the way.

30:35.680 --> 30:38.040
I presume that was what
you were looking for

30:38.040 --> 30:40.080
when you broke into
the Presbytery.

30:40.080 --> 30:42.480
A risky gamble,

30:42.480 --> 30:48.240
until you consider that it contained
all you owned in the world.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.440
Mrs Banks saw you.

30:50.440 --> 30:53.920
Fortunately for you,
she didn't believe her own eyes.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.920
And then there is
the wooden disc.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.720
It's a curious object.

31:00.720 --> 31:04.000
I believe it is
the constellation Gemini.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.480
"The Twins", in Greek mythology.

31:06.480 --> 31:10.720
Castor and Pollux inseparable
in looks and actions.

31:15.760 --> 31:17.280
Bryn made it.

31:17.280 --> 31:20.760
He was good at stuff like that.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.880
It must have been very hard,

31:24.880 --> 31:27.360
living like that for all that time.

31:27.360 --> 31:30.320
Two brothers sharing one life.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.560
Both answering to Ned.

31:32.560 --> 31:35.720
Taking it in turns
to be invisible.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.760
How did you do it?

31:43.000 --> 31:51.000
Truth is we got used to it.

31:55.400 --> 31:59.200
After a while, we stopped thinking
of ourselves as two separate people.

32:05.560 --> 32:11.040
It was always, "Gracy told us to do
this," or "We forgot to do that."

32:28.800 --> 32:32.880
You took equal responsibility
for each other's actions.

32:36.880 --> 32:42.040
Which is why you ended up in prison
for a crime you didn't commit.

32:46.720 --> 32:49.200
He was all I had, Father.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.480
I'd have done anything for him.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.960
How did he die?

33:01.520 --> 33:04.520
He wrote to me when he heard
I was getting out of prison.

33:04.520 --> 33:08.640
Said he wanted to meet in the woods
by the old tyre swing.

33:11.240 --> 33:13.360
We were going to start a new life.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.480
I had to know the truth
about what we'd done.

33:20.480 --> 33:22.960
What he done.

33:22.960 --> 33:26.520
It wasn't my fault.
I thought she wanted to, you know.

33:26.520 --> 33:29.920
But then she ran off.
Fell and cut her leg.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.720
Must have caught an artery
or something,

33:31.720 --> 33:33.400
because there was blood everywhere.

33:33.400 --> 33:34.600
She started screaming.

33:34.600 --> 33:38.720
I tried to calm her down
but she wouldn't shut up, so...

33:38.720 --> 33:41.200
So?

33:41.200 --> 33:44.080
I did what I had to do.

33:44.080 --> 33:46.360
You mean it wasn't an accident?

33:46.360 --> 33:49.200
She was going to get us found out.
We'd have been split up again.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.960
We did get split up again!

33:51.960 --> 33:54.640
I panicked.

33:54.640 --> 33:57.200
You weren't even supposed to be
with her. I know!

33:57.200 --> 33:59.800
You were supposed to be keeping
out of sight. I know!

34:02.400 --> 34:04.080
You left me.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.120
I did you a favour.

34:06.120 --> 34:08.640
Do you have any idea how bad things
have been for me

34:08.640 --> 34:09.920
over the past few years?

34:09.920 --> 34:11.800
Are you being serious?

34:11.800 --> 34:15.040
You've had a roof over your head
and three square meals a day.

34:15.040 --> 34:17.560
I had to go to war just to get fed.

34:18.760 --> 34:21.040
Do you have any idea how bad
things have to get

34:21.040 --> 34:23.040
before that
becomes your best option?

34:24.320 --> 34:25.960
What did you do with the body?

34:31.720 --> 34:34.720
There was an old well shaft
at the edge of the woods.

34:34.720 --> 34:36.800
At least that's what I think it is.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.840
A big deep hole with a wooden lid.

34:38.840 --> 34:42.720
I found it one day by accident
so I knew it was there.

34:43.880 --> 34:46.360
I put her in there
and covered it with branches.

34:49.640 --> 34:51.360
Don't look at me like that.

34:51.360 --> 34:54.000
I did this for us.
If she hadn't have screamed...

34:57.520 --> 34:59.720
Wait, wait. Where are you going?

34:59.720 --> 35:01.840
Where are you going?
I'm going to the police.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.760
What?
I'm going to tell them everything.

35:03.760 --> 35:06.440
Why? You have to pay
for what you did.

35:06.440 --> 35:09.120
Get out of my way.
I can't let you do that.

35:09.120 --> 35:10.400
You can't stop me.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.560
Stop! Stop!

35:16.720 --> 35:19.640
Why couldn't you just let it go?

35:19.640 --> 35:20.960
Why?

35:31.400 --> 35:33.800
And then you switched identities.

35:36.480 --> 35:40.480
I realised that if everyone thought
Ned Hannigan was dead...

35:42.400 --> 35:45.720
..I'd be free to go somewhere
else and start over.

35:45.720 --> 35:50.400
Indeed, and yet you are still here.

35:50.400 --> 35:53.840
I thought if I could give
Maggie back to her family,

35:53.840 --> 35:57.520
it wouldn't make up for
anything, but...

35:57.520 --> 35:59.680
You were looking for the well.

36:00.800 --> 36:04.600
That's what you were doing
when Mrs Banks first saw you.

36:06.520 --> 36:09.120
He said it was on the edge
of the woods.

36:09.120 --> 36:12.600
I've looked the whole way
round, but...

36:12.600 --> 36:15.120
You didn't find it.

36:15.120 --> 36:18.720
No... No. I'm sorry.

36:18.720 --> 36:21.640
Nora Banks has been charged
with your murder.

36:21.640 --> 36:24.600
It's time to tell the truth
and set this right.

36:28.200 --> 36:33.160
No-one's going to believe me,
that it was self-defence.

36:33.160 --> 36:34.840
They'll hang me.

36:37.680 --> 36:40.560
Maybe it's what I deserve.

36:42.720 --> 36:45.000
God forgive me,

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
I killed my brother.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.160
I'm sorry.

36:53.160 --> 36:55.120
I'm so sorry for all of it.

36:56.800 --> 37:04.160
Ned, are you ready to confess your
sins and ask God for forgiveness?

37:04.160 --> 37:05.480
Yes.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.840
The Banks family do not deserve
to suffer

37:11.840 --> 37:14.480
any more than they already have.

37:14.480 --> 37:17.640
And neither do you.

37:17.640 --> 37:19.720
Perhaps there is another way.

37:54.040 --> 37:56.920
Sergeant. Father.

38:01.360 --> 38:03.000
Anything?

38:03.000 --> 38:06.400
Perhaps if he'd handed himself in
to be questioned properly

38:06.400 --> 38:10.200
instead of this ridiculous cloak
and dagger written confession.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.840
I think he felt he'd been
punished enough.

38:12.840 --> 38:15.160
Where is he, Padre?

38:15.160 --> 38:17.400
I don't know, Inspector.

38:17.400 --> 38:21.720
There's nothing here.
It's hopeless.

38:29.360 --> 38:32.960
I'm sorry, we weren't able
to find her.

38:32.960 --> 38:35.400
Well, at least we got some answers.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.160
That'll have to do.
It's time to move on.

38:38.160 --> 38:41.920
And I'm not going mad,
so that's good.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.720
Indeed.

38:43.720 --> 38:49.200
I remember the day this photo
was taken. We were in
Weston-super-Mare.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.240
That's right. We went crabbing,

38:51.240 --> 38:53.680
and Maggie caught that massive one,
do you remember?

38:53.680 --> 38:55.200
She put it in the picnic basket.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.680
And Dad put his hand in
to get a sandwich.

39:00.240 --> 39:03.360
I forgot how funny she was.

39:05.240 --> 39:06.840
Oh, love.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.240
Oh, Son.

39:18.520 --> 39:20.400
So, you're looking for a well.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.720
The trees used to come
all the way out to here

39:22.720 --> 39:25.920
but it was cleared for timber
in the '40s.

39:25.920 --> 39:29.760
1939, this would've still all been
in the woods.

39:30.960 --> 39:33.720
Here you go. Open it up.

39:50.160 --> 39:51.840
Men.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.960
# Abide with me

40:07.960 --> 40:13.040
# Fast falls the eventide

40:15.960 --> 40:20.160
# The darkness deepens

40:20.160 --> 40:25.520
# Lord, with me abide

40:27.000 --> 40:31.200
# When other helpers

40:31.200 --> 40:36.200
# Fail and comforts flee

40:36.200 --> 40:42.080
# Help of the helpless

40:42.080 --> 40:48.120
# Oh, abide with me

40:50.120 --> 40:58.120
# Swift to its close ebbs out
life's little day

41:00.920 --> 41:04.920
# Earth's joys grow dim

41:04.920 --> 41:10.320
# Its glories pass away

41:12.120 --> 41:20.120
# Change and decay
in all around I see

41:22.520 --> 41:27.800
# O Thou who changest not

41:27.800 --> 41:31.040
# Abide with me. #

41:35.080 --> 41:37.200
Inspector. Father.

41:37.200 --> 41:38.920
Sergeant.

41:38.920 --> 41:41.280
Mr Gracy.

41:41.280 --> 41:42.960
Daniel.

41:47.640 --> 41:50.400
Thank you. For everything.

41:50.400 --> 41:52.560
Is there anything else I can do?

41:52.560 --> 41:54.280
You can join us for a drink.

41:54.280 --> 41:56.440
I think we can help you there.

42:00.880 --> 42:03.480
Well, that was a lovely service,
Father.

42:03.480 --> 42:05.160
I liked the flowers.

42:05.160 --> 42:08.920
Yes. That was quite
the sacrifice, Mrs McCarthy.

42:08.920 --> 42:11.240
Well, it was in a very worthy cause.

42:11.240 --> 42:14.240
I've never really cared
about winning

42:14.240 --> 42:17.080
the Best Kept Village competition.

42:17.080 --> 42:19.440
Besides, there's always next year.
