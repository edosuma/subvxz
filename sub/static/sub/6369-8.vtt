WEBVTT

00:12.680 --> 00:16.117
Julius:
* Let it grow,
let it grow *

00:16.150 --> 00:19.420
* Can't fold a crack
anymore *

00:19.453 --> 00:23.591
* Let it snow,
let it snow *

00:23.624 --> 00:26.360
* Turn away
and slam the floor... *

00:26.394 --> 00:27.828
Whoo, slam it!

00:27.861 --> 00:30.331
* I don't hear

00:30.364 --> 00:33.801
* What they're going
to play *

00:33.834 --> 00:37.371
* The cold never
followed me anyway. *

00:37.405 --> 00:38.606
( cheering, applause )

00:38.639 --> 00:39.840
- Bravo!
- Bravissimo!

00:39.873 --> 00:42.243
- All right!
- Encore!

00:44.412 --> 00:47.148
Ugh. I am so sick
of that movie.

00:47.181 --> 00:49.517
If I hear that song
one more time, I'm gonna
kill myself.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.085
It's a nice song.

00:51.119 --> 00:52.853
Yeah, it's a nice song.
It's a fucked-up movie.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.223
Fucked up?
How the fuck
is it fucked up?

00:55.256 --> 00:57.158
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, how is it fucked up?

00:57.191 --> 00:58.659
Lee: Let me
tell you something.

00:58.692 --> 01:02.696
That is the most fucked-up,
destructive movie

01:02.730 --> 01:04.132
of maybe
the past 50 years.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.533
- What?
- I'm serious.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.136
This girl is born
with this tremendous power,

01:08.169 --> 01:09.270
so what do they do?

01:09.303 --> 01:10.671
They lock her ass up.

01:10.704 --> 01:13.474
In a room.
By herself.
For years.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.643
But get this.
She's a princess.

01:15.676 --> 01:18.246
So one day
she gets her revenge.

01:18.279 --> 01:21.449
She goes out, she turns
that whole village to ice,

01:21.482 --> 01:24.885
and then she builds
her own palace with
her own two hands.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.787
It's awesome!

01:26.820 --> 01:29.657
What a message
for little girls.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.225
Then she sings that song

01:31.259 --> 01:33.894
from the depths
of her liberated soul.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.298
It is time to see
what I can do

01:37.331 --> 01:41.469
to test the limits
and break through.

01:41.502 --> 01:44.738
Let it go.
Let it go.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.207
It's amazing, right?

01:46.240 --> 01:47.475
That's where
the movie should end.

01:47.508 --> 01:48.676
But how does it end?

01:48.709 --> 01:53.614
Ends with this once
strong-willed, free girl

01:53.647 --> 01:56.517
using her power to make
other people happy.

01:56.550 --> 01:59.853
Oh, here's a new sled
for Sven.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.589
I'm gonna build
a beautiful fountain

02:01.622 --> 02:03.624
for all those
fuckin' townspeople

02:03.657 --> 02:05.726
who never gave
a shit about you

02:05.759 --> 02:09.597
when you were
locked in a room
for 16 fucking years.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.600
( sighs )

02:14.668 --> 02:16.770
- Snowman was funny.
- ( laughter )

02:16.804 --> 02:18.772
Don't even
get me started
about "Tangled."

02:18.806 --> 02:21.842
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

02:21.875 --> 02:24.545
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

02:24.578 --> 02:27.415
* If you're
happy and you know it,
then motherfucking show it *

02:27.448 --> 02:30.284
* If you're happy
and you know it, clap your
motherfucking hands *

02:30.318 --> 02:33.521
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands! *

02:33.554 --> 02:36.724
Man:
Aggression. Competition.
Anal penetration.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.293
These are just a few
of the things corporate America

02:39.327 --> 02:42.330
has in common with the hardcore
pornography business.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.497
Love the Keebler stuff.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.366
Oh. I didn't.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.802
Hello.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.738
I'm adult film star
James Deen.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.540
What can a porn star
teach you

02:52.573 --> 02:54.442
about success
in the business world?

02:54.475 --> 02:56.944
Well, quite a lot,
actually.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.912
The adult film industry
and corporate America

02:58.946 --> 03:01.415
have more in common
than you might think.

03:01.449 --> 03:04.418
Join me, James Deen,
over the next 30 minutes

03:04.452 --> 03:06.587
while I teach you
three of my foolproof tips

03:06.620 --> 03:10.624
for unparalleled success
in pornography and/or
corporate America.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.361
What the fuck is this?

03:13.394 --> 03:16.630
James:
Rule number one:
someone is gonna get fucked.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.666
They moved your office.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.501
They? Who?

03:20.534 --> 03:22.536
They who?
Them.

03:22.570 --> 03:23.704
Why?

03:23.737 --> 03:25.473
This is the new
ideation room.

03:25.506 --> 03:28.942
- This is
completely outrageous.
- This is bullshit.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.644
They've already
moved your desktop

03:30.678 --> 03:32.446
to your new office
along with your desk.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.416
You have a 10:00 meeting
in Kurosawa to review
the pitch work,

03:35.449 --> 03:38.319
and the army strategy session
is in Coen at 2:00.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.788
Cohen. Leonard.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.756
Leonard?
Ethan and Joel.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.958
Of course.
Of course. Stupid.

03:44.992 --> 03:47.561
Well...
( sighs )

03:47.595 --> 03:49.763
I'm not moving.
Not moving.

03:49.797 --> 03:52.333
They've put you
in Larry's old office.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.502
This is my office.

03:54.535 --> 03:55.869
No. No, it's not.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.438
Now it's the ideation room.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.039
Okay, tell Jonathan
I want to speak to him

03:59.072 --> 04:01.875
right here right now,
or he can shove

04:01.909 --> 04:04.412
his fucking Coke meeting
up his fucking ass.

04:07.448 --> 04:11.885
Julius:
* Let it blow,
let it blow... *

04:11.919 --> 04:15.356
Oh, buddy.
Buddy, no.
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.758
* Let it go,
let it go... *

04:17.791 --> 04:20.328
No more singing.
We are so late for school.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.730
I love your voice,
but we've gotta go.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.298
Julius, now!

04:24.332 --> 04:25.866
Come here.
We're too late for this.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.335
- Let me get this off.
- I wanna wear it!

04:27.368 --> 04:28.769
Fine. Do you have
clothes on underneath?

04:28.802 --> 04:30.304
Okay, let's go.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.672
- Wait.
- What?

04:31.705 --> 04:34.041
- I wanna take it off.
- Oh, my God!

04:34.074 --> 04:35.709
It's the same thing
every morning.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.511
This is getting
ridiculous, Julius.

04:37.545 --> 04:38.812
- On or off?
- On.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.948
Fine. On it is.
Let's go.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.316
I asked you
so many times.

04:42.350 --> 04:45.953
Mom, why are you
always so angry?

04:46.987 --> 04:48.389
I'm not angry, buddy.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.723
I'm just--
I'm sick of this.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.392
I'm sorry.

04:51.425 --> 04:52.960
It's just every morning
it's the same thing.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.828
- Come on.
- Okay.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.096
You don't have
to take it off.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.666
Jules,
you wanna wear it
to school, you can.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.934
I don't!

05:00.968 --> 05:02.803
Okay, fine.
Let's go.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.005
- Yes.
- Okay. We'll have it here
for you for after school.

05:05.038 --> 05:08.609
Put your coat on.
All right, let's go.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.912
- * Go, let it go...
- Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go.

05:11.945 --> 05:15.115
* Can't hold it back
anymore... *

05:15.148 --> 05:16.316
( sighs )

05:16.350 --> 05:18.552
Thom:
What the fuck
is an ideation room?

05:18.586 --> 05:20.020
It's the Swedes' idea,
Thom.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.822
What-- oh,
so the Swedes
had an idea.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.024
- Great. Well, you know,
someone call "Adweek."
- I already did.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.527
- They're coming by for
some photos this afternoon.
- What?

05:26.560 --> 05:29.096
"MGT face-lift begins.

05:29.129 --> 05:32.099
Ideation room
first of many changes."

05:32.132 --> 05:33.834
Thom, you gotta
stop fighting this.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.803
- Fighting what?
- Progress.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.771
What, made-up rooms
for made-up words?

05:37.805 --> 05:39.573
- That's progress?
- What is the big deal?

05:39.607 --> 05:43.043
Yes, yes.
It's shallow and phony.
What did you expect?

05:43.076 --> 05:46.046
We traffic in this industry
in image and shadows

05:46.079 --> 05:47.581
and appearances
and illusions.

05:47.615 --> 05:51.084
The fact is, MGT needs
to become an industry leader

05:51.118 --> 05:54.121
in creative concepting,
thought, growth, and ideation.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.723
Why are you talking
like this?

05:55.756 --> 05:57.791
I happen to be the leader
of this agency.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.093
I love you,
I love your talent,

06:00.127 --> 06:02.563
but it's my responsibility
to make sure

06:02.596 --> 06:05.466
that MGT approaches
the task of problem solving

06:05.499 --> 06:07.535
with innovative,
out-of-the-box thinking.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.969
You're doing it again.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.071
Look,
you still have an office.
It's just smaller.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.473
Well, then, why don't
they use your office?

06:12.506 --> 06:14.942
Because the Swedes
thought the ideation room

06:14.975 --> 06:16.143
should be centrally located.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.945
Your office
is the perfect spot.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.113
It's a good idea, Thom.

06:26.454 --> 06:30.057
I think now is a good time
to talk about cock.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.025
Whether you're
in the jizz biz
or the ad biz,

06:32.059 --> 06:33.427
the three
most important words

06:33.461 --> 06:35.896
are cock, cock,
and monster cock.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.165
People ask me,
"James, what about talent,

06:38.198 --> 06:40.968
ability, skill,
commitment?

06:41.001 --> 06:43.804
Aren't these things
more important than size?"

06:43.837 --> 06:46.940
No, they're not.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.777
Woman:
Lee, my favorite parent.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.179
- I have a huge
favor to ask you.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.181
Adrian was supposed
to be lunch mom today,

06:54.214 --> 06:57.751
but she caught Alex's cold,
and now she's stuck in bed.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.553
Uh, are--
are you asking me?

06:59.587 --> 07:01.555
'Cause I haven't been
to the studio all week.

07:01.589 --> 07:04.124
- So I'm gonna just go to the--
- The kids just adore you.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.926
And it would make
Julius so happy.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.461
And we could really,
really use the help.

07:07.495 --> 07:08.829
What about Willow?
Look, she's--

07:08.862 --> 07:09.997
Doctor's appointment.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.832
- Sarah?
- No car.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.034
- January?
- She works.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.669
She works?
I work.

07:15.703 --> 07:18.472
In an office, I mean.
You know, a job job.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.040
A job job?

07:20.073 --> 07:21.809
Hey, you don't
have to convince me.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.877
- I think making art
is a job, too.
- Oh, thank you.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.979
It's just-- she can
get fired, you know.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.782
Please, Lee.
Julius would so love it.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.951
He really loses his shyness
when you're around.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.986
- Fine. Great. Okay.
- Yay!

07:33.887 --> 07:35.489
You are such a good mom.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.157
Let's get started.

07:44.865 --> 07:48.235
( screams )

07:48.268 --> 07:51.605
Woman: I'll tell you
what you can do with
your stupid time-outs!

07:51.639 --> 07:54.642
You can take 'em
and shove 'em up
your ass, lady,

07:54.675 --> 07:56.910
you fucking bitch!

07:56.944 --> 07:58.712
( screams )

07:58.746 --> 08:00.814
( sobbing )

08:08.889 --> 08:10.591
( shouting )

08:10.624 --> 08:13.126
* Don't let the bastards
grind you down *

08:13.160 --> 08:15.228
* Don't let them
grind you down... *

08:15.262 --> 08:19.600
Thom:
Misery, suffering,
agony, death--

08:19.633 --> 08:20.934
everyone is angry.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.736
Everyone is dissatisfied.

08:22.770 --> 08:25.072
And so we ask you,
who is the real rebel?

08:25.105 --> 08:29.543
The angry man
or the happy one?

08:30.944 --> 08:33.614
Coke.
Fight the glower.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.652
So?

08:40.754 --> 08:41.855
I feel that, yo.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.692
Thanks, Atomic.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.160
I like the, uh--
the line.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.130
Uh, okay, look.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.800
A more comfortable way
into radical happiness

08:52.833 --> 08:55.035
would be to have happy people
doing happy things,

08:55.068 --> 08:56.704
but this, I think--
you know,

08:56.737 --> 08:59.640
I think audiences are ready
for a more honest approach.

08:59.673 --> 09:03.043
You say to people,
"Yes, you're angry.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.745
We're all angry.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.647
But you don't have to be.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.716
You can take a break
from your anger

09:08.749 --> 09:10.818
and have a Coke."

09:10.851 --> 09:14.287
Well, not everyone
is as angry as you, Thom.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.189
Well, you're about
twice as angry as me, so...

09:16.223 --> 09:17.925
- Fuck you, Thom.
- There it is.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.093
I agree with Thom.
People are angry.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.662
All the research
proves that.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.096
I just don't know
if anyone wants to admit

09:23.130 --> 09:24.331
that they're angry.

09:24.364 --> 09:25.933
People like to think
that they're happy.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.901
Mm, even when they're not.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.336
Especially when they're not.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.338
The angrier they feel,
the happier they insist
they are.

09:31.371 --> 09:34.141
I think it's--
it's powerful.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.143
It's thought-provoking.

09:36.176 --> 09:39.012
Well, it's just a--
an ideation.

09:40.648 --> 09:41.949
Gottfrid?

09:41.982 --> 09:44.952
Uh, yeah.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.119
Me and Gustaff
went about this

09:46.153 --> 09:48.388
a bit
of a different way.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.358
Um, they want
a campaign.

09:51.391 --> 09:56.296
Fine, but what if instead
of a campaign of commercials,

09:56.329 --> 09:58.799
of sales pitches
and product attributes,

09:58.832 --> 10:01.635
of intrusion, really...

10:02.335 --> 10:05.839
what if we just created...

10:05.873 --> 10:07.274
moments?

10:10.143 --> 10:11.344
- Moments.
- Moments.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.246
I mean, we don't need
stories anymore.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.249
We live in
a post-story society.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.985
We have Vines
and Instagrams

10:18.018 --> 10:20.854
and, you know,
YouTube fail videos.

10:20.888 --> 10:23.390
We collect
and share moments,

10:23.423 --> 10:26.026
so let's make
Coca-Cola moments.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.861
Of peace,
of happiness.

10:27.895 --> 10:30.731
I mean,
everyone talks about
disruption marketing--

10:30.764 --> 10:31.899
excuse me, Thom.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.300
But who wants
to be disrupted?

10:33.333 --> 10:37.270
We want to be
comforted, consoled.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.673
Consolation marketing--

10:39.707 --> 10:42.175
that is the future.
( snaps fingers )

10:42.209 --> 10:46.814
We don't want to see bombs
and, you know, riot police.

10:46.847 --> 10:50.383
What we want are puppies.

10:50.417 --> 10:54.221
- * Sunshine,
lollipops, and rainbows... *
- ( staff laughing, cooing )

10:54.254 --> 10:56.089
* Everything
that's wonderful *

10:56.123 --> 10:59.059
* Is what I feel
when we're together *

10:59.092 --> 11:03.430
* Brighter than a lucky penny
when you're near the... *

11:03.463 --> 11:05.733
Gottfrid:
Moment of happiness #17

11:05.766 --> 11:08.368
brought to you
by the Coca-Cola Company.

11:08.401 --> 11:11.138
Happiness--
always within reach.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.806
( applause )

11:12.840 --> 11:14.207
Something like that.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.279
I'm happier already.

11:19.312 --> 11:22.449
You know, 18-- kittens.
And 22-- babies.

11:22.482 --> 11:25.953
Did you ever see that monkey
snuggling the dog video?

11:25.986 --> 11:29.189
We should see
if #yourmomentofhappiness
is available.

11:29.222 --> 11:33.193
- It's a big opportunity.
- ( all talking )

11:37.097 --> 11:39.733
Thom.

11:39.767 --> 11:40.734
Hi.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.936
I just wanted
to apologize.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.504
- You know.
- Oh.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.040
I mean, personally, we think
it's a bit ridiculous.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.776
I mean,
an ideation room?

11:48.809 --> 11:49.777
My God.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.278
I mean, if you're
going to ideate,

11:51.311 --> 11:53.480
you have to have an agency
designed around ideating.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.816
You can't just ideate
in any little room,
you know.

11:55.849 --> 11:59.787
So, I thought
the ideation room
was your idea.

12:00.954 --> 12:03.857
We would never
ideate such a thing

12:03.891 --> 12:05.158
as an ideation room.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.493
Right. No, the room,
it's ridiculous.

12:06.526 --> 12:09.096
I mean, frankly, we think
it's a bit pathetic.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.999
So whose idea was it?

12:12.032 --> 12:13.233
Gottfrid:
Jonathan.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.367
- Jonathan?
- Yeah.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.936
We expected
more of him, too.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.437
- Jonathan?
- I don't know.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.439
I guess he felt like he needed
to do something for himself,

12:19.472 --> 12:21.975
to stay relevant
or something.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.510
Anyways,
I just want you to know
I think it's awful

12:23.543 --> 12:24.812
that he threw you
out of your office.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.114
I mean, that was
very disrespectful.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.381
Sorry, man.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.784
Uh, well,
I appreciate it.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.319
Yeah.

12:36.556 --> 12:40.994
James: Bondage.
Whipping. Fisting.

12:41.028 --> 12:44.264
Double penetration
or good, old-fashioned
one-on-one missionary.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.498
Doesn't matter.

12:45.532 --> 12:49.236
Porno and/or corporate America
rule number two--

12:49.269 --> 12:51.839
even when it's not about
dominance and submission,

12:51.872 --> 12:54.274
it's about dominance
and submission.

12:54.307 --> 12:57.210
Children:
* I don't care

12:57.244 --> 13:01.214
* What they're going
to say *

13:01.248 --> 13:04.818
* Let the storm rage on

13:04.852 --> 13:07.320
* The cold
never bothered me anyway. *

13:07.354 --> 13:09.022
Oh, that was awesome,
you guys.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.158
It was great
the first five times, too.

13:11.191 --> 13:14.862
So, um, why don't
we stop singing and
start eating, okay?

13:14.895 --> 13:18.298
- I'm Elsa,
and I froze you.
- Ugh. Uh-oh.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.967
Guess I'm gonna have
to lock you in your room

13:20.000 --> 13:22.502
for your whole
freakin' childhood.
( mock laughs )

13:22.535 --> 13:26.373
Children:
* It's funny
how bug sister's *

13:26.406 --> 13:29.910
* Makes everything
a ball... *

13:29.943 --> 13:32.145
This is torture.

13:32.179 --> 13:35.448
- Hey, Lee.
- Oh, hey, Sandy.
Hi, Lola.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.217
Lola had a question
for you.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.585
- Oh, sure, shoot.
- Go ahead, Lol.

13:38.618 --> 13:41.088
Can I have a playdate
with Julius today?

13:43.223 --> 13:45.025
Today?

13:45.058 --> 13:47.094
Thom:
And I'll tell you
something else, asshole.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.962
I'm staying here.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.999
You know, if you want
an ideation room,

13:52.032 --> 13:52.765
have it in your office.

13:52.799 --> 13:54.902
"Adweek"
can photograph my ass.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.204
"Epiphanies are orgasms
of the mind."

13:57.237 --> 13:59.106
Fuck off.
20 years.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.975
20 years I've known you
in this bullshit industry,

14:02.009 --> 14:03.476
and you've never once
lied to me.

14:03.510 --> 14:04.611
Thom.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.079
Or I don't know.
Maybe you have.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.214
I don't know anymore.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.615
"You can't depend
on your eyes

14:08.648 --> 14:11.418
when your imagination
is out of focus."

14:11.451 --> 14:13.386
It's like a--
it's like a cult.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.423
It's a fucking cult
of gibberish.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.291
This is what
it's come down to.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.360
You screw me and then
lie about it afterwards.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.897
What is it, Jonathan?
Are you that desperate?
Are you that scared?

14:23.931 --> 14:27.300
Yes! Yes! I am!

14:27.334 --> 14:30.403
This tyranny of youth.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.372
I created this
with my own hands.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.640
I built the temples.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.442
I taught 'em all
how to pray.

14:35.475 --> 14:38.345
But I never
in my wildest dreams

14:38.378 --> 14:39.646
imagined that
it would go this far.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.982
I'm telling you,
if a 25-year-old

14:42.015 --> 14:43.483
walked into
that boardroom upstairs

14:43.516 --> 14:45.352
and suggested that
it would be off the hook

14:45.385 --> 14:46.686
if they all
killed themselves,

14:46.719 --> 14:48.288
they'd all have nooses
around their necks

14:48.321 --> 14:49.622
by the time his
presentation was over.

14:49.656 --> 14:52.392
Have you heard
Gustaff's plan
for the office?

14:52.425 --> 14:53.526
Have you heard it?
You know what it is?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.395
Nothing.
That's the plan.

14:55.428 --> 15:00.267
Nothing. No walls,
no doors, no hallways.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.136
They want to spend
$5 million

15:03.170 --> 15:05.172
removing the $10 million

15:05.205 --> 15:07.140
that we put
into this place
three years ago,

15:07.174 --> 15:09.442
and the board couldn't
approve it fast enough.

15:09.476 --> 15:10.677
I fought 'em
tooth and nail,

15:10.710 --> 15:12.946
but they rolled
their eyes, scowled,

15:12.980 --> 15:16.683
and reminded me this
is a youth-driven business.

15:16.716 --> 15:19.652
It was a room full
of fucking 70-year-olds,
by the way.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.157
I'm sorry.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.529
I'm scared.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.599
I'm-- I'm...

15:34.701 --> 15:36.069
baffled.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.339
This is a level
of asinine

15:39.372 --> 15:43.410
even I can't understand.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.113
You know,
we're glad to hear you
admit that, Jonathan.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.647
Oh, Jesus.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.250
It's important for a man
to know his, uh, limitations.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.985
We're having
a private conversation.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.587
- It's the ideation room, Thom.
- Gottfrid, you seem perturbed.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.423
I can almost detect
a wrinkle in your forehead.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.724
Yeah, well, I get
a little perturbed

15:57.757 --> 15:59.692
when "Adweek" is invited
into my agency--

15:59.726 --> 16:02.062
- Your agency?
- My agency.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.563
Let us finish
our conversation.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.598
You would not be
in this fucking building...

16:05.632 --> 16:08.201
This was my office.
My office!

16:08.235 --> 16:09.536
( all shouting )

16:09.569 --> 16:12.272
You shot
your fucking brains
all over it.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.075
( shouting continues )

16:15.108 --> 16:17.177
- Gottfrid: What?
- Jonathan: Who are you?

16:17.210 --> 16:21.081
- Uh, I'm looking
for Jonathan Berg.
- That's me.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.483
I'm from "Adweek."
I'm here to take some photos.

16:23.516 --> 16:26.053
- Both: Hey!
- Jonathan: How are you?

16:26.086 --> 16:28.388
- Just spitballing a bit.
- Welcome to my ideation room.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.357
We're just--
we're ideating.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.424
Ideating.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.226
My final rule?

16:33.260 --> 16:35.628
Well,
that's something you learn
on your first porno set

16:35.662 --> 16:38.465
when you look
down at that girl
and she's covered in come,

16:38.498 --> 16:40.100
smiling and rubbing it in

16:40.133 --> 16:42.169
like it's the sweet
elixir of life.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.372
Thom?

16:45.405 --> 16:47.507
Thom. Please?

16:47.540 --> 16:48.641
Is there a problem?

16:48.675 --> 16:50.577
Jonathan:
No, no, no, no.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.115
- Photographer: And...
- ( Jonathan laughs )

16:55.148 --> 16:58.385
You have to pretend
that you love it.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.220
One, two, three.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.722
Ideation!
( laughs )

17:02.755 --> 17:04.524
Children:
* Let it throw

17:04.557 --> 17:08.261
* The ball never
followed me anyway. *

17:08.295 --> 17:11.531
- Whoo! Yay.
- All right. Okay, guys.
That was awesome.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.400
* It's funny
how some days... *

17:13.433 --> 17:15.268
Excuse me.

17:15.302 --> 17:18.371
- Excuse me.
- * Makes everything
seem small *

17:18.405 --> 17:21.741
* And fears that
once controlled me *

17:21.774 --> 17:24.711
* Can't get to me
at all *

17:24.744 --> 17:29.082
* Let it throw,
let it throw,
the ball... *

17:32.319 --> 17:33.586
( door opens )

17:33.620 --> 17:36.123
Is that weed?

17:36.156 --> 17:38.558
Uh, yeah.

17:38.591 --> 17:41.060
Do I have to bring
my own, or...?

17:44.464 --> 17:46.533
( sighs )

17:46.566 --> 17:48.268
Kids okay?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.871
Who gives a fuck?

17:51.904 --> 17:55.074
( both laughing )

17:57.710 --> 17:59.212
You know,
that field trip
on Monday,

17:59.246 --> 18:02.215
school concert on Tuesday,
lunch mom today--

18:02.249 --> 18:04.317
it's way too much
mothering this week.

18:04.351 --> 18:05.585
I'm mothered out.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.487
Mother... fucked.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.389
Tell me about it.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.124
Every afternoon
around 3:00,

18:11.158 --> 18:13.226
I wanna tear my uterus out
and beat it with a stick.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.327
Ugh.

18:14.361 --> 18:17.164
( laughs )

18:20.667 --> 18:23.836
Pam told me that
January has a real job.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.539
That's why she asked me
to cover lunch mom.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.875
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

18:28.908 --> 18:32.545
Because somehow spending
your time in a studio,

18:32.579 --> 18:34.214
trying to express
your truth,

18:34.247 --> 18:37.750
making art
out of your pain
and your humanness,

18:37.784 --> 18:40.887
your fear,
that's not a real job.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.423
But accounting,
that's a real job.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.857
Can't interrupt that.
God forbid.

18:44.891 --> 18:47.160
At least you got art.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.495
I got nothing.

18:48.528 --> 18:49.896
I'm just a mom.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.898
( exhales )

18:51.931 --> 18:53.766
Mm-mm.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.503
I once told them
I was getting
a mammogram.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.239
To get out of being
a lunch mom?

19:01.541 --> 19:02.909
Wait a minute.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.412
You said that you were
getting a mammogram

19:05.445 --> 19:06.746
to get out of lunch mom?

19:06.779 --> 19:09.382
- Yeah.
- That is so awesome.

19:09.416 --> 19:10.917
I was gonna say
mastectomy,

19:10.950 --> 19:13.186
but I didn't think
they'd believe me.

19:13.220 --> 19:17.790
Well, that's an excuse
that you can only use
a couple times.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.694
I remember
when I first had Jules.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.696
The first night
in the birthing center...

19:23.730 --> 19:27.234
( laughs )
and he starts crying.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.202
And we have
no idea what to do.

19:29.236 --> 19:31.571
So I run over
to the nursing station,
and there's three of them.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.273
It's, like,
2:00 in the morning.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.642
I'm like, "Hey,
what's the deal
with a baby crying?

19:35.675 --> 19:38.511
Do you pick 'em up
or let 'em cry or what?"

19:38.545 --> 19:41.781
- Right.
- And the middle one
goes, "Oh, no.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.650
You never let
baby cry."

19:43.683 --> 19:44.951
I hate that shit.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.653
And then I was like,
"Oh, really?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.721
You never let
baby cry?"

19:48.755 --> 19:50.357
And she was like,
"Uh-uh.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.625
In fact,
I let my daughter
sleep in my bed

19:52.659 --> 19:54.961
until she was
12 years old."

19:54.994 --> 19:55.995
Oh, come on.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.764
And then the other nurse
was like, "Yeah, me, too."

19:57.797 --> 19:59.566
And then the third nurse
was like, "Yep."

19:59.599 --> 20:01.768
And I was like, "Wow.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.704
How did your husbands
feel about that?"

20:04.737 --> 20:08.741
And the one nurse goes,
"Oh, we got divorced
three years ago."

20:08.775 --> 20:10.477
Because divorce
is great for baby.

20:10.510 --> 20:11.878
Baby loves divorce.

20:11.911 --> 20:15.582
It's ridiculous,
because you're not a parent;

20:15.615 --> 20:18.785
you're a person
who happens to be
a parent.

20:18.818 --> 20:21.721
- Yes.
- You see
what I'm saying?

20:21.754 --> 20:23.923
- Yes!
- Right?

20:23.956 --> 20:27.727
Told my shrink
that I feel bad

20:27.760 --> 20:31.731
because being a mother
isn't enough.

20:31.764 --> 20:34.000
Uh-oh.
What'd he say?

20:34.033 --> 20:36.769
He told me
to try Lexapro.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.305
Mine said Prozac.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.839
Oh, see?

20:39.872 --> 20:41.674
That's why
we're high on pot.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.276
Yeah, well, fuck it.

20:43.310 --> 20:45.678
Whatever gets you
through the day,
you know?

20:45.712 --> 20:46.846
- Hear, hear.
- Yeah, right.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.415
- Mm.
- Mm.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.883
Kids, who wants
to bake brownies?

20:50.917 --> 20:53.886
- Children: Yay!
- Whoo-hoo!

21:01.894 --> 21:03.630
Don't be too angry
with Jonathan.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.632
( sighs )

21:05.665 --> 21:07.567
Something changed
between us today.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.436
It's--

21:09.469 --> 21:11.871
it's--
it's just different.

21:14.941 --> 21:18.010
There was this porn star
a while back.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.913
Tested positive
for an STD.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.081
You know what he did?

21:22.114 --> 21:24.351
- Nope.
- He lied about it.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.819
Faked his test results.
Kept on working.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.621
What an asshole.

21:28.655 --> 21:29.922
You know why he did it?

21:29.956 --> 21:32.058
- Because he's an asshole?
- No doubt.

21:32.091 --> 21:35.428
Lie about an STD test,
you're on the shit list
for life.

21:35.462 --> 21:38.665
But that got me thinking.
We're born against our will.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.700
Oftentimes we die
the same way.

21:40.733 --> 21:45.438
Between that,
we gotta find food,
shelter, clothing.

21:45.472 --> 21:50.377
Surviving in this world
is fuckin' ugly.

21:50.410 --> 21:53.480
- Mm.
- That's what
Jonathan's doing.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.081
He's surviving.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.551
Nobody said
it was gonna be pretty.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.891
( sighs )

22:10.597 --> 22:12.365
( owl hooting )

22:12.399 --> 22:16.469
- An ideation room?
- An ideation room.

22:16.503 --> 22:17.970
Ugh.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.072
Contemplation corner.

22:20.106 --> 22:22.041
Yeah, well, you know,
to be fair,

22:22.074 --> 22:23.743
it helps with
the "au-think-ification."

22:23.776 --> 22:26.579
Ah, I see.
With your "conceptitudes."

22:26.613 --> 22:28.815
"Go-fuck-yourself-itation."

22:28.848 --> 22:31.618
- ( laughs )
- That's gold.

22:33.620 --> 22:36.956
- Is Jules still
watching "Frozen"?
- Mm-hmm.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.958
It's dazzling fun
for the whole family.

22:38.991 --> 22:41.728
- It says it on the DVD.
- Yeah, yeah.

22:41.761 --> 22:44.897
- Maybe-- maybe not
the whole family.
- Ugh.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.936
They should have
alternate endings

22:49.969 --> 22:51.471
for the parents
that have had

22:51.504 --> 22:54.173
to sit through it
a thousand times.

22:54.206 --> 22:58.611
Like, movie ends,
Anna and Elsa hug,

22:58.645 --> 23:01.981
you know, everything's
beautiful in Arendelle,

23:02.014 --> 23:04.784
and then Olaf
just grabs a gun

23:04.817 --> 23:06.853
and just shoots everybody.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.655
It just--
it's a bloodbath.

23:08.688 --> 23:10.156
Kills all of them.

23:10.189 --> 23:13.893
Ugh. God.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.728
Pot and booze.

23:15.762 --> 23:17.930
Are we terrible
parents?

23:20.467 --> 23:22.835
Whatever gets you
through the day.

23:22.869 --> 23:25.705
Ah.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.674
( wind howling )

23:29.208 --> 23:32.178
* The snow around me
on this mountaintop *

23:32.211 --> 23:36.449
* Is a lazy metaphor

23:36.483 --> 23:39.185
* I hated "Tangled"
and that mermaid one *

23:39.218 --> 23:43.222
* But I hated "Frozen"
even more *

23:43.255 --> 23:46.092
* It's not the story,
the characters or theme *

23:46.125 --> 23:50.630
* It's the simplistic answers
that make me want
to scream... *

23:50.663 --> 23:52.198
( gasps )

23:58.905 --> 24:02.942
* Elsa decides
that she'll be free *

24:02.975 --> 24:06.212
* Bitch,
it ain't that easy *

24:06.245 --> 24:09.181
* Some of us need
more than hugs *

24:09.215 --> 24:13.219
* Some of us, well,
we need drugs *

24:27.734 --> 24:31.103
* Lexapro, Lexapro

24:31.137 --> 24:34.707
* Two pills a day,
no more *

24:34.741 --> 24:37.877
* Lexapro, Lexapro

24:37.910 --> 24:41.714
* May cause diarrhea,
gas, and more *

24:41.748 --> 24:46.018
* I don't care
what the warning labels say *

24:46.052 --> 24:48.120
* I'll take it
with food *

24:48.154 --> 24:51.758
* 'Cause side effects

24:51.791 --> 24:55.261
* Never bothered me
anyway *

24:56.996 --> 25:00.032
* "Fake joy beats
real sadness" *

25:00.066 --> 25:03.135
* Said René Descartes

25:04.303 --> 25:07.039
* He must've met
my mother *

25:07.073 --> 25:10.677
* What's frozen
is her heart... *

25:10.710 --> 25:14.046
You think some pills
will stop a holocaust?

25:16.182 --> 25:19.786
* It's time to see
what pills can do *

25:19.819 --> 25:23.289
* To chemically change
my point of view *

25:23.322 --> 25:29.261
* Just ask my pharmacist,
you'll see *

25:29.295 --> 25:35.201
- * I'm free...
- Oh! Aah!

25:35.234 --> 25:38.971
* Lexapro, Lexapro

25:39.005 --> 25:42.675
* Two pills a day,
no more *

25:42.709 --> 25:45.645
* Lexapro, Lexapro

25:45.678 --> 25:49.148
* May cause diarrhea,
gas, and more *

25:49.181 --> 25:53.720
* I don't care
what the warning labels say *

25:53.753 --> 25:55.788
* I'll take it
with food... *

25:55.822 --> 25:59.792
Side effects
never bothered me anyway.

26:05.097 --> 26:08.334
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

26:08.367 --> 26:10.937
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

26:10.970 --> 26:13.840
* If you're happy and you
know it, then your face
will surely show it *

26:13.873 --> 26:16.676
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

26:16.709 --> 26:19.145
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

26:19.178 --> 26:21.981
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

26:22.014 --> 26:24.884
* If you're happy and you
know it, then your face
will surely show it *

26:24.917 --> 26:27.654
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

26:27.687 --> 26:30.089
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

26:30.122 --> 26:32.959
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

26:32.992 --> 26:35.828
* If you're happy and you
know it, then your face
will surely show it *

26:35.862 --> 26:38.631
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

26:38.665 --> 26:41.100
* If you're happy and you

26:41.133 --> 26:43.970
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

26:44.003 --> 26:46.806
* If you're

26:46.839 --> 26:49.241
* If you're happy

motherfucking hands *

26:49.275 --> 26:52.111
* If you're happy and you

will surely show it *

26:52.144 --> 26:55.882
* If you're happy
