00:00.680 --> 00:02.330
Previously on "The
Vampire Diaries"...

00:02.365 --> 00:03.040
He's dead.

00:03.050 --> 00:05.780
No, no! I can't, I can't!

00:05.814 --> 00:07.721
I can help you. Turn it off.

00:07.757 --> 00:09.595
We're gonna lose her, Damon.

00:09.630 --> 00:11.305
She's ruthless
without her humanity.

00:11.340 --> 00:13.000
The cure's the fastest
way to get it back.

00:13.035 --> 00:14.265
Katherine has the cure.

00:14.300 --> 00:16.010
She's gonna want to
cram it down your throat.

00:16.045 --> 00:17.115
The last thing that you want

00:17.150 --> 00:18.580
is for that cure to be used on you,

00:18.615 --> 00:20.042
so you bring it to me.

00:20.077 --> 00:21.470
You don't scare me, Silas.

00:23.250 --> 00:24.975
Just a little something
to remember me by.

00:25.010 --> 00:26.710
It's all of Katherine's
former addresses,

00:26.745 --> 00:28.410
including a couple from
the last two months.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.560
You want the cure off the table.

00:29.595 --> 00:30.787
I want to take it.

00:30.822 --> 00:31.980
We can work together.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074

00:44.100 --> 00:45.300
Why are we stopping?

00:46.320 --> 00:49.290
We've searched 3 cities
in the last 24 hours.

00:49.300 --> 00:52.610
I'm sick of top 40 radio,
and I smell like leather.

00:52.645 --> 00:53.635
And that's my fault?

00:53.670 --> 00:56.210
You are the one who stole the list
of Katherine's possible whereabouts.

00:56.245 --> 00:58.440
Did you ever think that
Damon had bad information?

00:58.640 --> 01:01.010
Have I mentioned I can't
stand the sound of your voice?

01:01.045 --> 01:02.660
Too bad. We're not done.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.319
Get in. Next town.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.090
In a minute.

01:07.830 --> 01:08.955
I'm hungry.

01:08.990 --> 01:11.010
We're not here for
a pub crawl, Elena.

01:11.140 --> 01:12.765
I want the cure. Katherine has it.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.390
We don't stop until we find her.

01:15.760 --> 01:16.990
I said, in a minute.

01:20.030 --> 01:21.590
Oh, my god. You startled me.

01:21.625 --> 01:22.770
Did I?

01:24.720 --> 01:26.030
Katherine, what are you doing?

01:32.690 --> 01:33.740
You know me?

01:33.775 --> 01:34.790
Of course.

01:35.310 --> 01:36.865
Um, I know most people around here

01:36.900 --> 01:38.385
prefer you to feed from the neck,

01:38.420 --> 01:40.650
but I asked you to drink
from my wrist. Remember?

01:42.580 --> 01:45.070
Conniving little bitch
compelled the whole town.

01:47.340 --> 01:48.940
I think we just found Katherine.

01:53.770 --> 01:54.960
What's my full name?

01:55.300 --> 01:56.465
Katherine Pierce.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.020
I love the new 'do, by the way.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.530
So how do you know Katherine?

01:59.990 --> 02:01.370
How do I know who?

02:03.780 --> 02:05.960
Me. How do you know me?

02:06.410 --> 02:08.280
Small town. Everybody
knows everybody.

02:08.315 --> 02:10.039
So everyone here knows Katherine.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.880
I'm sorry. I don't know
who you're talking about.

02:17.180 --> 02:18.860
She compelled people
to forget all about her

02:18.895 --> 02:20.140
unless she was talking
to them herself.

02:20.175 --> 02:21.370
Clever girl.

02:23.030 --> 02:24.375
How long have we known each other?

02:24.410 --> 02:27.010
Uh, it's been a while.
I can't remember.

02:27.020 --> 02:28.780
Where do I live? Where do I work?

02:29.310 --> 02:30.380
I don't know.

02:30.550 --> 02:32.530
Who do I spend time with?
Do I have any friends?

02:33.610 --> 02:35.590
Well, you said we could
all be friends with you

02:35.625 --> 02:37.190
as long as we kept your secret.

02:38.110 --> 02:39.290
What secret?

02:39.980 --> 02:40.930
I...

02:42.340 --> 02:43.560
I don't know.

02:46.550 --> 02:48.980
If they so much as even
scratch the paint on my car.

02:49.140 --> 02:50.665
Why don't you just be
grateful sheriff Forbes

02:50.700 --> 02:53.750
was able to track down the
car after you let them, uh...

02:54.000 --> 02:55.695
You know, steal it from you.

02:55.730 --> 02:57.510
Remind me to send
her some mini-muffins.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.465
Do we really need 10 gallons of gas

02:59.500 --> 03:01.970
or are you making me just
lug this around as punishment?

03:02.005 --> 03:04.440
Well, they ditched your car
after it ran out of fuel.

03:04.475 --> 03:05.285
We got to fill it up.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.860
We got a hundred miles
before we get to Willoughby.

03:06.895 --> 03:07.800
Yeah, well, I don't
remember that name

03:07.810 --> 03:09.710
from the list of places
that I got in New York.

03:09.745 --> 03:10.570
Oh, the list.

03:10.580 --> 03:12.840
You mean the list they stole
from right under your nose

03:12.875 --> 03:14.300
after you let your guard down?

03:14.780 --> 03:15.975
They'll be there.

03:16.010 --> 03:18.400
Sheriff Forbes tracked down
the car they stole after yours.

03:18.410 --> 03:20.410
Screw the muffins.
I'll get her champagne

03:21.960 --> 03:24.430
if Elena is wherever it may be.

03:27.985 --> 03:28.875
Willoughby.

03:28.910 --> 03:29.740
They'll be there.

03:29.750 --> 03:32.790
Let's just hope we get to them
before they get to the cure.

03:32.825 --> 03:34.935
Ooh, silver lining.

03:34.970 --> 03:36.465
If Rebekah takes the
cure, then she's mortal.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.190
And then we can just kill
her right then and there.

03:38.225 --> 03:39.705
Ooh, dark cloud.

03:39.740 --> 03:41.520
Elena stays a vampire forever.

03:42.510 --> 03:44.630
Look, why don't you just table
the revenge fantasies for now

03:44.665 --> 03:46.637
and just keep your
eye on the prize?

03:46.672 --> 03:48.610
Find Katherine, get
the cure, get out

03:48.760 --> 03:51.320
before you get your
neck snapped again.

03:51.340 --> 03:52.950
Believe me, I learned my lesson.

03:53.180 --> 03:55.515
Elena without humanity
is a stone cold bitch.

03:55.550 --> 03:57.800
And I won't trust her until
we get the old Elena back.

03:58.810 --> 04:01.840
Look at that. We're finally on
the same page about something.

04:02.170 --> 04:03.490
Look at that.

04:46.220 --> 04:47.560
Klaus? We need to talk.

04:49.930 --> 04:51.160
What happened to you?

04:51.800 --> 04:53.060
Silas.

04:53.590 --> 04:55.100
He attacked me.

04:55.710 --> 04:58.000
He stabbed me with
the white oak stake.

04:59.350 --> 05:02.690
A piece of it is still inside me.

05:03.010 --> 05:04.820
My God, Klaus, that could kill you.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.280
I certainly feel like I'm dying.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.840
And as much as I would
love to watch you die,

05:21.875 --> 05:23.970
you still haven't
found me that cure.

05:24.100 --> 05:25.470
Silas!

05:28.500 --> 05:29.640
That's right.

05:30.890 --> 05:32.425
Last night I looked like Shane.

05:32.460 --> 05:34.575
Today I look like Caroline.

05:34.610 --> 05:36.690
And tomorrow, who knows?

05:36.940 --> 05:38.670
Show me your real face.

05:39.290 --> 05:40.195
Now, why would I do that

05:40.230 --> 05:42.810
when I can look like
whomever I want you to see.

05:52.430 --> 05:54.170
Resist me all you want, Klaus,

05:54.205 --> 05:56.677
but until you bring me the cure,

05:56.712 --> 05:59.150
I will bring you
nothing but misery.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.845
Hey, excuse me. Um...

06:12.880 --> 06:14.450
Did I get any mail today?

06:15.090 --> 06:16.410
What happened to your hair?

06:17.790 --> 06:18.775
I cut it.

06:18.810 --> 06:20.410
In the last two minutes.

06:20.830 --> 06:22.460
I was here two minutes ago?

06:24.080 --> 06:25.920
Are you feeling ok, Ms. Pierce?

06:25.990 --> 06:28.500
Yeah. I'm--I'm
fine. Um, thanks.

06:30.850 --> 06:31.665
She was here two minutes ago.

06:31.700 --> 06:33.310
That means that she
can't be that far.

06:33.960 --> 06:34.990
How about you check inside?

06:35.025 --> 06:36.020
I'll look in the parking lot.

06:36.055 --> 06:37.000
Ok.

06:50.620 --> 06:51.525
I'm impressed.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.200
I never thought you
would find me here.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.620
Oh, well. It's a
beautiful place to die.

06:59.020 --> 07:00.350
I couldn't agree more.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.160
You've chosen a
beautiful place to die.

07:10.350 --> 07:11.500
Where's the cure?

07:12.300 --> 07:16.330
What, no "I'm here to avenge my
annoying little brother" speech?

07:16.750 --> 07:18.550
People die. We move on.

07:23.390 --> 07:26.150
After turning off
our humanity switch.

07:28.090 --> 07:29.620
So sad for the boys, though.

07:29.690 --> 07:32.390
Their special snowflake
of human frailty...

07:32.510 --> 07:33.530
Gone.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.270
Well, if we're gonna be a while,

07:36.305 --> 07:37.540
I'm gonna go grab some menus.

07:40.670 --> 07:41.890
You're not going anywhere.

07:43.020 --> 07:45.100
I forgot how charming you were.

07:45.150 --> 07:47.000
I'm surprised you
remember me at all,

07:47.130 --> 07:49.010
seeing as though you were so busy

07:49.045 --> 07:50.890
wedging yourself
between my brothers.

07:51.770 --> 07:53.190
Oh, my god. What happened?

07:59.060 --> 08:02.080
I'm fine, Jolene. You
didn't see anything.

08:06.900 --> 08:08.865
Every minute you two
waste with your yapping

08:08.900 --> 08:11.200
is another minute we give
Stefan and Damon to find us.

08:12.540 --> 08:13.850
Where's the cure?

08:14.130 --> 08:16.500
I'm sorry. I'm on vervain.

08:16.540 --> 08:18.770
Oh, I get to torture
it out of you. Fun.

08:20.810 --> 08:22.545
Why do you two want it anyway?

08:22.580 --> 08:24.090
The question is,
why do you want it?

08:24.180 --> 08:25.890
Let me guess. To kill Niklaus.

08:25.900 --> 08:29.165
I've spent the last 500 years
running from your big brother.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.429
I have no intention of being
within sniffing distance of him.

08:33.640 --> 08:36.120
But since it can
be used against him,

08:36.600 --> 08:39.210
I'm sure he's just itching
to get his hands on it.

08:39.500 --> 08:42.179
I give him the cure,
he gives me my freedom.

08:42.370 --> 08:44.059
Ohh, you poor victim.

08:44.310 --> 08:45.265
Where's the part of your plan

08:45.300 --> 08:47.950
where you screw us
over and somebody dies?

08:47.985 --> 08:49.740
I have no reason to screw you over.

08:50.840 --> 08:53.580
I know you don't believe
me, but it is the truth.

08:53.640 --> 08:57.260
People change. I'm not
the girl you think I am.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.770
I don't have it on me.

09:02.310 --> 09:03.035
I didn't think you did,

09:03.070 --> 09:06.170
but I'm sure there's something
in that that can help us find it.

09:07.580 --> 09:08.620
Who's Em?

09:10.700 --> 09:11.920
A friend.

09:12.190 --> 09:14.240
It says here you're
meeting at 2:00.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.650
I guess I'll just
have to meet Em myself.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.895
I got your 50 bajillion messages.

09:25.930 --> 09:27.810
This better be life and death.

09:28.170 --> 09:29.450
Go away.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.180
Klaus? Where are you?

09:35.240 --> 09:36.870
What happened to you?

09:37.640 --> 09:39.325
I need more time.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.010
Stop hounding me!

09:43.070 --> 09:44.980
I'm hounding you?

09:46.480 --> 09:48.900
I am supposed to be running 3
different prom committees right now

09:48.935 --> 09:50.960
and you keep phone stalking me.

09:51.720 --> 09:52.940
Caroline.

09:54.890 --> 09:56.390
Is it really you?

10:07.540 --> 10:09.030
Prove it to me.

10:10.240 --> 10:12.870
Ok. I don't know if this
is some new way of flirting,

10:12.905 --> 10:14.175
but it sucks.

10:14.210 --> 10:16.200
And I have more
important things to do.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.970
Wait, please.

10:19.710 --> 10:21.860
Silas. He stabbed me

10:21.950 --> 10:23.890
with white oak stake.

10:24.220 --> 10:27.130
There's a little piece
of it stuck inside me.

10:28.030 --> 10:29.865
Why would Silas attack you?

10:29.900 --> 10:32.310
Well, I was in no
position to ask questions.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.320
Suffice it to say, I'm hurt.

10:37.020 --> 10:40.160
So you can understand
why I called you.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.100
You ran Tyler out of town,
you killed his mother,

10:48.135 --> 10:50.560
and you think I'm the
person to call for help?

10:51.040 --> 10:52.260
If I die,

10:52.760 --> 10:54.810
you, Tyler,

10:55.620 --> 10:57.790
all of your friends die with me.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.560
What do you want me to do?

11:12.280 --> 11:14.300
Well, it's quite simple, really.

11:14.930 --> 11:17.120
I need you to cut
the stake out of me.

11:24.010 --> 11:25.310
Something's not right.

11:26.310 --> 11:29.100
Katherine Pierce does not
hole up in hickstown, p-a.

11:29.135 --> 11:31.030
Well, this is definitely
the car they stole.

11:31.430 --> 11:32.715
We're in the right place.

11:32.750 --> 11:34.690
Points to them for
their choice of vehicles.

11:34.760 --> 11:35.895
So let me ask you something.

11:35.930 --> 11:36.995
What happens when we find Elena?

11:37.030 --> 11:38.690
How do we get her
back to Mystic Falls?

11:39.180 --> 11:40.965
I mean, she's not
exactly gonna go quietly.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.030
And she has an original
vampire as her bodyguard.

11:44.065 --> 11:45.500
We do whatever we have to do.

11:45.690 --> 11:47.650
I don't care if we have to
throw Rebekah under a school bus

11:47.685 --> 11:49.090
and wrap Elena in a burlap sack.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.610
We do whatever we have to do.

11:50.900 --> 11:51.385
I'm serious.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.960
I am, too. I don't care
what Elena wants right now.

11:53.970 --> 11:55.950
She's this close to going
off the rails for good.

11:55.985 --> 11:57.370
And that ain't happening.

11:57.540 --> 11:59.120
She's a pain enough as it is.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.310
So what happened to
the guy who thought

12:01.345 --> 12:03.237
Elena should embrace
being a vampire,

12:03.272 --> 12:05.130
let the chips fall where they may.

12:05.370 --> 12:07.040
That guy got his neck
snapped in New York.

12:07.075 --> 12:09.590
and this guy is royally pissed off.

12:23.100 --> 12:23.810
What do you think? Hmm...

12:24.870 --> 12:27.700
It's close. Not
quite slutty enough.

12:27.910 --> 12:29.470
I think you need more eyeliner.

12:32.290 --> 12:33.740
I'm gonna need your clothes.

12:34.050 --> 12:35.640
Yeah. That's gonna happen.

12:36.480 --> 12:40.370
Fine. Your bracelet,
watch, earrings.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.150
Hand them over.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.120
And your other bracelet.

12:55.690 --> 12:57.610
That's my daylight bracelet.

12:57.645 --> 12:58.872
It's daytime outside.

12:58.907 --> 13:00.100
I'm gonna need it.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.990
Besides, it's not
gonna work on you.

13:02.100 --> 13:05.460
Fine. I really am gonna
need that jacket, though.

13:12.060 --> 13:14.180
All right. Fine, fine, fine.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.050
This will never work, you know?

13:19.340 --> 13:20.670
The bad haircut.

13:20.680 --> 13:23.590
The doe eyes. You'll
never pass for me.

13:25.780 --> 13:27.230
You'll never pass for me.

13:27.265 --> 13:28.922
Throatier and more mannish.

13:28.957 --> 13:30.580
You'll never pass for me.

13:31.620 --> 13:33.160
You two are pathetic.

13:33.350 --> 13:34.620
You two are pathetic.

13:34.630 --> 13:37.410
Oh, perfect. Just the
right level of contempt

13:37.445 --> 13:38.840
and hidden insecurity.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.880
Almost there. Something's missing.

13:46.960 --> 13:51.420
Your shoes. I want your shoes.

14:03.540 --> 14:04.850
Come on, Em.

14:06.420 --> 14:10.600
Mm. You know, it's funny.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.405
I've always been a little envious

14:13.440 --> 14:15.730
of the legend that
is Katherine Pierce,

14:16.000 --> 14:19.060
the way you could wrap a man
around your little finger,

14:19.440 --> 14:21.540
the way Elijah
betrayed Klaus for you,

14:21.840 --> 14:24.310
the way the Salvatore brothers
stumbled head over heels for you.

14:24.345 --> 14:28.730
And yet here we are
all these years later

14:29.240 --> 14:32.040
in a town that you've had
to compel into liking you.

14:35.290 --> 14:36.860
I'm sorry. I shouldn't laugh.

14:36.895 --> 14:38.430
It's really more sad than funny.

14:39.250 --> 14:42.100
You know you can't split
the cure with Elena, right?

14:43.580 --> 14:44.790
She doesn't want to.

14:44.930 --> 14:48.280
Oh, no? But you do.
You want to take it.

14:49.370 --> 14:52.280
Are you really that dumb
or just naturally blonde?

14:52.315 --> 14:53.717
I want a normal life again.

14:53.752 --> 14:55.120
You mean you want a do-over.

14:55.310 --> 14:57.255
Well, guess what.
You can't have it.

14:57.290 --> 14:59.570
The cure will only take
away your immortality.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.540
Everything else you
hate about yourself,

15:01.650 --> 15:03.510
you'll still wake up
with that in the morning.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.190
And you won't even be able
to compel yourself a friend.

15:09.830 --> 15:11.970
Ladies, playing nice?

15:15.140 --> 15:16.425
There goes the neighborhood.

15:16.460 --> 15:17.825
I see you got Katherine already.

15:17.860 --> 15:19.190
You're losing your touch, evil one.

15:23.870 --> 15:25.010
Where's Elena?

15:28.770 --> 15:29.870
Katerina.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.170
Elijah.

15:36.530 --> 15:37.950
You're a little late, aren't you?

15:39.560 --> 15:40.920
You colored your hair.

15:44.050 --> 15:45.290
I like it.

15:46.950 --> 15:48.910
Thank you. I was
actually gonna--

16:06.070 --> 16:07.250
I missed you.

16:08.970 --> 16:10.255
And I've missed you.

16:10.290 --> 16:13.050
This is an interesting little town
you've chosen to settle down in.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.350
So do you have it with you?

16:17.680 --> 16:18.960
Do I have what?

16:18.995 --> 16:20.210
The cure.

16:23.810 --> 16:25.510
It's in a safe place.

16:26.470 --> 16:28.030
Why don't I go and get it

16:28.700 --> 16:30.800
And then I'll bring it back?

16:32.350 --> 16:33.880
Where's Katherine, Elena?

16:35.900 --> 16:37.430
So let me get this straight,

16:37.550 --> 16:38.675
I tell you where Elena is,

16:38.710 --> 16:40.295
you shove the cure down her throat,

16:40.330 --> 16:41.880
and then I end up in a box, right?

16:42.210 --> 16:43.550
I don't think so.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.700
What about you over there, smiley?

16:46.230 --> 16:47.710
Do you know where she is?

16:47.770 --> 16:49.100
I can give you a hint.

16:49.810 --> 16:51.520
Start by looking
at the town morgue.

16:51.630 --> 16:53.290
She's probably dead.

16:59.250 --> 17:01.090
She went to meet up
with a friend of mine.

17:01.250 --> 17:02.540
You may
know him--

17:02.560 --> 17:05.500
An original brother.
Impeccable taste.

17:06.050 --> 17:07.260
Elijah?

17:07.450 --> 17:08.510
Elijah's here?

17:08.609 --> 17:10.095
Well, you sort of have to question

17:10.130 --> 17:13.710
Elijah's impeccable taste
if he's friends with you.

17:14.310 --> 17:17.990
Oh, when I say friend,
I mean "Friend."

17:20.880 --> 17:24.515
It probably took him about 10
seconds to realize that she wasn't me,

17:24.550 --> 17:28.150
at which point he probably yanked
her heart right out of her chest.

17:29.420 --> 17:30.840
All right. Where are they?

17:33.750 --> 17:34.700
Rebekah,

17:35.250 --> 17:36.860
you do realize if something
should happen to Elena,

17:36.870 --> 17:39.300
you have no chance of
finding the cure, right?

17:42.840 --> 17:47.510
Fine. They were supposed to
meet at the gazebo by the park.

17:48.790 --> 17:50.095
I'll go talk to Elijah.

17:50.130 --> 17:51.365
You deal with Elijah.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.030
Katherine will take us to the cure.

17:53.460 --> 17:55.055
No, she won't.

17:55.090 --> 17:57.990
The cure's my one chance to
win my freedom back from Klaus.

17:58.025 --> 18:00.040
You're gonna broker
a deal with Klaus?

18:00.050 --> 18:03.750
No. She's gonna get Elijah
to broker a deal for her.

18:06.670 --> 18:09.270
That's why you need your
little friend, isn't it?

18:10.330 --> 18:12.780
Some things never
change, Katherine.

18:13.670 --> 18:14.810
Nope.

18:18.070 --> 18:19.050
Fine.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.880
Move.

18:22.260 --> 18:23.520
You have to follow me.

18:32.750 --> 18:33.990
Oh, my god.

18:34.540 --> 18:35.990
You do have a heart.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.900
Oh, my bad. It's just a bloody rib.

18:40.630 --> 18:43.400
Well, I'm glad you're
finding my misery so amusing.

18:44.880 --> 18:47.020
I swear there's nothing in here.

18:47.750 --> 18:50.030
And if you think I'm
having fun, you're insane.

18:50.120 --> 18:53.230
You killed 12 witches
for your friend Bonnie.

18:53.350 --> 18:56.030
You can't even get your
hands a little dirty for me.

18:56.410 --> 18:58.290
Here I thought we
were becoming friends.

18:58.830 --> 19:00.410
Well, you thought wrong.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.710
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

19:09.310 --> 19:10.510
You know what?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.435
I'm not sorry.

19:13.470 --> 19:16.260
You deserve to suffer for
everything that you've done.

19:16.300 --> 19:19.320
So today, we're gonna
do things my way.

19:19.820 --> 19:23.195
You want my help? You let
Tyler come back to town,

19:23.230 --> 19:26.570
and give me your word
that you will not hurt him.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.090
Katerina?

19:36.230 --> 19:37.260
Hello. Elijah?

19:38.700 --> 19:39.995
Where is Katherine?

19:40.030 --> 19:42.040
- Where's Elena?
- Safe.

19:42.060 --> 19:43.940
How long she remains
so depends upon you.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.820
Well, I guess the same
goes for Katherine.

19:46.270 --> 19:49.050
Katherine can take care of
herself against the two of you.

19:49.060 --> 19:50.570
Oh. You mean the three of us.

19:51.140 --> 19:54.040
'cause little sister decided to join
team good guys for the time being.

19:57.550 --> 19:58.820
Put her on the phone.

19:59.140 --> 20:00.770
Oh, she's not here right now.

20:00.780 --> 20:02.410
I left her with
Damon and Katherine.

20:02.445 --> 20:03.540
Tell me where they are.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.145
Relax. No one's gonna get hurt

20:05.180 --> 20:07.110
as long as Katherine
hands over the cure.

20:07.145 --> 20:07.735
Do you understand

20:07.770 --> 20:09.745
how much my sister
despises Katherine?

20:09.780 --> 20:11.780
I assure you, Rebekah will end her

20:11.815 --> 20:13.657
the moment she ceases to be of use.

20:13.692 --> 20:15.166
Well, just tell me where you are,

20:15.201 --> 20:16.605
and we can talk this through.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.720
You listen to me very
carefully, Stefan.

20:18.755 --> 20:20.800
If anything whatsoever
happens to Katherine,

20:20.810 --> 20:23.840
I will descend upon Elena.

20:27.540 --> 20:29.310
You're both idiots.

20:29.820 --> 20:30.915
Excuse me.

20:30.950 --> 20:33.795
Ugh. What happened to you, Elijah?

20:33.830 --> 20:36.130
I mean, I thought you were
supposed to be a man of honor.

20:36.165 --> 20:37.707
And yet you've been hooking up

20:37.742 --> 20:39.226
with Katherine this entire time?

20:39.261 --> 20:40.675
Well, I suppose this man of honor

20:40.710 --> 20:43.300
always shared a
connection with Katherine.

20:44.350 --> 20:45.185
She contacted me

20:45.220 --> 20:46.735
when she learned about the cure.

20:46.770 --> 20:48.850
We thought we could be of
mutual use to one another.

20:48.885 --> 20:50.355
"Of mutual use"?

20:50.390 --> 20:52.375
Please. You fell for her trap

20:52.410 --> 20:55.330
just like every other
one of those idiots.

20:56.910 --> 20:58.950
You underestimate me, Elena.

20:58.985 --> 21:00.605
I know who she is.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.330
I know what she's done.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.415
And you think she's changed?

21:04.450 --> 21:07.155
She's playing you. She
lied to you, Elijah.

21:07.190 --> 21:09.860
She didn't lie to me
about your transformation.

21:14.790 --> 21:17.550
You're not just a
vampire, though, are you?

21:20.850 --> 21:23.305
There's something else.

21:23.340 --> 21:25.760
You...you're not yourself.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.700
You've abandoned
your emotions. Why?

21:29.735 --> 21:31.160
My brother's dead.

21:31.680 --> 21:33.230
Your girlfriend killed him.

21:37.020 --> 21:38.330
You didn't know?

21:40.320 --> 21:41.640
Of course you didn't.

21:42.750 --> 21:44.130
She lied.

21:44.140 --> 21:46.360
I hate to say I told you so, but...

21:47.220 --> 21:48.330
Duh!

21:53.620 --> 21:56.120
No sudden moves. No tricks either.

21:56.155 --> 21:58.110
No katherine-ing.

22:04.980 --> 22:07.310
A quilt and a fish aquarium.

22:07.730 --> 22:08.745
Who the hell are you?

22:08.780 --> 22:11.560
A very old lady
with dreadful taste.

22:17.280 --> 22:18.420
It's gone.

22:19.570 --> 22:22.760
The cure, it was in the
safe, but it's not there.

22:22.870 --> 22:24.360
Not falling for it.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.160
Where is it, Katherine?

22:26.195 --> 22:27.565
I swear it was in the safe.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.510
What, just like Elijah's
really your boyfriend

22:29.545 --> 22:31.010
And this is really your life?

22:31.020 --> 22:32.840
And for all we know, this
isn't even your house.

22:32.875 --> 22:34.860
It doesn't look like
the katherine I know.

22:34.870 --> 22:37.540
Maybe you don't know
Katherine at all.

22:37.575 --> 22:38.515
Did it every occur to you

22:38.550 --> 22:40.655
that you have no
idea who I really am?

22:40.690 --> 22:43.510
Did it every occur to you
that you're not that deep?

22:43.545 --> 22:46.330
This whole small-town girl
thing, we know it's an act.

22:46.420 --> 22:47.800
Where is the cure?

22:50.550 --> 22:52.380
Whoa, whoa. Hang on.
We need her alive.

22:52.390 --> 22:53.640
The cure's not here.

22:54.300 --> 22:56.030
You check upstairs.
I'll check down.

22:57.080 --> 22:58.310
I got this.

23:03.470 --> 23:06.045
So if I was a paranoid,

23:06.080 --> 23:08.585
distrustful sociopath,

23:08.620 --> 23:12.140
where would I keep my
most prized possession?

23:12.400 --> 23:13.525
This should be fun.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.240
Because I'd want it to
be close, but not on me.

23:17.310 --> 23:19.360
Accessible but not obvious.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.095
I'd want to keep it safe,

23:21.130 --> 23:24.640
but not so safe that it'd be
too difficult to grab and run.

23:28.560 --> 23:32.290
Well, that is a fancy
little treasure chest

23:32.750 --> 23:35.210
In a tank with no fish.

23:39.730 --> 23:41.480
I think I'm gonna
have to check that out.

23:45.020 --> 23:46.380
Vervain water.

23:46.400 --> 23:48.180
Looks like we have a winner.

23:58.660 --> 24:00.570
Give it to me or you're dead.

24:02.220 --> 24:03.745
You're gonna kill me anyway.

24:03.780 --> 24:05.530
So what's more
important to you, huh?

24:05.640 --> 24:08.820
Killing me or getting the cure?

24:13.350 --> 24:15.790
Look, Rebekah...

24:16.060 --> 24:17.660
Don't even think about it.

24:30.950 --> 24:32.670
Let's just talk about this,

24:32.810 --> 24:35.970
like the two rational
vampires that we are.

24:37.110 --> 24:39.470
- Rebekah?
- Oh, give it a rest.

24:39.500 --> 24:40.750
Me taking this cure
is the best thing

24:40.785 --> 24:42.360
that'll ever happen to you.

24:42.570 --> 24:44.155
Don't do anything stupid.

24:44.190 --> 24:46.770
Admit it. You don't
want human Elena

24:46.805 --> 24:47.730
running back to Stefan

24:47.740 --> 24:50.480
whilst you're left
out in the cold again.

24:52.030 --> 24:53.190
Go on, Damon.

24:53.770 --> 24:56.090
Tell me why you want
Elena to have the cure.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.490
That's what I thought.

25:06.560 --> 25:07.700
No!

25:29.760 --> 25:33.770
I can feel the splinters
moving towards my heart.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.340
Help me!

25:36.570 --> 25:38.285
Your word first.

25:38.320 --> 25:42.170
And what makes you think I
won't simply break my word?

25:43.630 --> 25:45.190
You want to be friends?

25:46.500 --> 25:49.090
Friendship--stage
one.

25:49.270 --> 25:51.250
Show me that I can trust you.

25:51.260 --> 25:53.130
I saved your life...

25:53.165 --> 25:53.860
twice.

25:53.870 --> 25:55.730
Because you put it in danger...

25:55.765 --> 25:56.870
twice.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.295
Why can't you just do

25:58.330 --> 26:00.145
something decent for once?

26:00.180 --> 26:02.880
Because Tyler Lockwood
tried to kill me.

26:02.970 --> 26:04.325
We've all tried to kill you.

26:04.360 --> 26:07.290
And you've tried
to kill most of us.

26:07.410 --> 26:08.700
How do you think that you deserve

26:08.710 --> 26:11.540
my friendship when you've
done nothing to earn it?

26:11.550 --> 26:14.200
I will not have my
hand forced by you

26:14.235 --> 26:15.145
or anyone else!

26:15.180 --> 26:16.730
What is wrong with you?

26:16.740 --> 26:18.680
I'm reaching out to
you despite everything

26:18.715 --> 26:19.415
that you have done,

26:19.450 --> 26:22.330
and you still can't
get out of your own way.

26:22.365 --> 26:25.060
God! I feel sorry for you.

26:25.100 --> 26:26.545
Don't turn your back on me!

26:26.580 --> 26:29.420
I should have turned
my back on you ages ago!

26:36.990 --> 26:38.200
It's gone.

26:39.310 --> 26:40.410
What?

26:43.090 --> 26:44.260
The pain.

26:47.520 --> 26:49.310
The pain is gone.

26:51.960 --> 26:54.970
Oh, see, it was never there.

26:55.300 --> 26:56.770
He got in my head.

26:57.520 --> 26:59.170
Silas...

27:00.450 --> 27:02.650
got inside my head.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.770
You took my mind off it.

27:11.620 --> 27:13.870
You brought me back, Caroline.

27:23.640 --> 27:26.600
If Silas can make
you, of all people,

27:26.610 --> 27:28.190
believe that you're dying...

27:29.720 --> 27:31.730
What can he do to the rest of us?

27:34.620 --> 27:36.205
Did you even try to stop her?

27:36.240 --> 27:38.180
You forgot the part where
I was bobbing for boxes

27:38.215 --> 27:39.255
in vervain water.

27:39.290 --> 27:41.570
All you had to do
was stall her, Damon.

27:41.605 --> 27:42.285
Sorry. It's Rebekah.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.810
I didn't have a pony
to distract her, Stefan.

27:45.720 --> 27:47.360
You let her take it, didn't you?

27:47.500 --> 27:48.740
You were never on my side.

27:48.775 --> 27:49.945
Now Elena will be a vampire

27:49.980 --> 27:52.220
for the rest of her life
just like you wanted.

28:04.460 --> 28:06.700
I know what it feels
like to lose a brother.

28:06.735 --> 28:08.650
I'm sorry for your pain. I...

28:09.660 --> 28:11.760
I only hope that you
can find your way back

28:11.795 --> 28:13.250
to yourself someday.

28:15.260 --> 28:18.090
Just like you hope Katherine
will find her way back?

28:18.250 --> 28:19.675
You still think that innocent girl

28:19.710 --> 28:22.470
you saved from Klaus ages
ago is in there somewhere.

28:22.505 --> 28:23.595
I'd like to think so, yes.

28:23.630 --> 28:26.800
She's not. She's a
monster now, Elijah.

28:27.120 --> 28:29.020
The sweet peasant girl
you fell in love with

28:29.055 --> 28:31.130
way back when is dead.

28:32.260 --> 28:33.720
And she's not coming back.

28:33.755 --> 28:35.180
I'm not a fool, Elena.

28:35.190 --> 28:36.315
Of course this has occurred to me,

28:36.350 --> 28:37.755
but what kind of man would I be

28:37.790 --> 28:39.160
if I didn't try to find my Katerina

28:39.195 --> 28:42.970
beneath this Katherine facade?

28:44.170 --> 28:46.220
You boys are all the same.

28:46.880 --> 28:47.975
Damon and Stefan still think

28:48.010 --> 28:51.680
that the girl they love is
still in here somewhere, too.

28:51.710 --> 28:54.290
You can't blame them
for having hope, Elena.

28:55.350 --> 28:56.945
It'd be a shame if the world lost

28:56.980 --> 28:58.540
a soul as compassionate as yours.

29:00.580 --> 29:03.090
"Your compassion is a gift, Elena."

29:06.650 --> 29:08.940
"Carry it with you
always and forever."

29:11.200 --> 29:13.330
I remember reading
that in a letter once.

29:14.140 --> 29:16.390
Well, the writer sounds
positively gifted.

29:17.240 --> 29:18.960
I'm sure he meant what he wrote.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.360
I'm sure he did.

29:22.110 --> 29:24.730
And it felt good to
watch that letter burn

29:25.680 --> 29:27.125
along with my old life

29:27.160 --> 29:29.030
and along with Jeremy's body.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.590
Sorry. I got held up.

29:49.900 --> 29:51.150
How do you feel?

29:52.390 --> 29:54.680
I--I feel
good. I...

29:55.370 --> 29:56.580
I feel great.

29:57.780 --> 29:59.360
I feel alive.

29:59.540 --> 30:01.660
Slight problem
with being alive--

30:01.930 --> 30:03.470
I can kill you now.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.360
I'm still a vampire.

30:22.880 --> 30:24.380
The cure didn't work.

30:25.130 --> 30:27.200
It worked just like
she wanted it to.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.270
The cure was a fake.

30:30.680 --> 30:31.760
It must have been
a concentrated shot

30:31.795 --> 30:33.500
of vervain or something.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.310
Katherine.

30:40.660 --> 30:42.850
Oh, come on. She could use a nap.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.050
It must be exhausting
trying to be me.

30:46.680 --> 30:48.650
You killed Jeremy Gilbert.

30:52.990 --> 30:54.065
Yes, Elijah.

30:54.100 --> 30:56.920
I killed Jeremy Gilbert.

30:57.180 --> 30:58.085
A bombshell, I'm sure.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.950
She just couldn't
wait to drop on you.

31:01.080 --> 31:03.960
Ironic, since she supposedly
doesn't care about anything.

31:03.995 --> 31:05.230
I care.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.750
Do you honestly feel
nothing for this girl,

31:06.785 --> 31:07.705
a girl fated to live

31:07.740 --> 31:09.415
the same life that you've endured?

31:09.450 --> 31:11.550
And now you've just taken
away the last of her family,

31:11.585 --> 31:13.930
just as yours was
taken away from you.

31:14.460 --> 31:17.020
Uh, why are you looking
at me like I enjoyed it?

31:17.055 --> 31:18.395
Jeremy was collateral damage.

31:18.430 --> 31:20.520
I was doing what I
needed to do to survive.

31:20.555 --> 31:22.200
Is that what I am, too?

31:22.460 --> 31:23.800
A means of survival.

31:23.810 --> 31:26.825
Don't let sweet little
Elena get to you.

31:26.860 --> 31:28.920
She hates me. She wants
you to turn against me

31:28.955 --> 31:30.990
and convince you that
I can't be trusted.

31:31.025 --> 31:33.010
I asked you a question.

31:33.045 --> 31:34.230
No.

31:36.630 --> 31:39.090
Of course you're not
a means of survival.

31:39.230 --> 31:40.910
You looked out for
me when I had no one.

31:40.945 --> 31:42.590
You're giving me
a second chance now

31:42.625 --> 31:43.670
when no one else will.

31:43.705 --> 31:45.090
I love you.

31:46.340 --> 31:47.600
Elijah.

31:51.490 --> 31:52.790
You don't believe me.

31:52.825 --> 31:54.470
I want to.

31:55.630 --> 31:57.420
It's my disease.

31:57.470 --> 31:59.160
I just keep wanting to believe you,

31:59.450 --> 32:00.990
but how can I when at every turn,

32:01.025 --> 32:02.530
you give me reason to doubt you?

32:02.680 --> 32:04.010
I don't know you.

32:05.370 --> 32:06.980
I don't know that I ever will.

32:09.320 --> 32:10.370
Wait.

32:12.400 --> 32:14.920
You gave me your word that
you would talk to Klaus.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.320
I--I can't make a
deal without you.

32:20.850 --> 32:22.140
Good-bye, Katherine.

32:41.500 --> 32:42.515
Katherine, hey.

32:42.550 --> 32:43.980
What brings you by at this hour?

32:43.990 --> 32:45.840
I came to retrieve my package.

32:45.930 --> 32:48.280
Oh. Of course. Like I said,

32:48.315 --> 32:50.630
your secret would be safe here.

33:07.060 --> 33:09.610
Hey, um... all the secrecy.

33:09.860 --> 33:12.810
Can I ask, what is it?

33:14.890 --> 33:16.370
It's my freedom.

33:30.420 --> 33:31.470
Wait.

33:31.950 --> 33:32.655
What do you want?

33:32.690 --> 33:34.390
To tell you that you're right.

33:36.730 --> 33:39.600
I've spent so much time running

33:39.635 --> 33:41.130
and lying just to survive

33:41.165 --> 33:42.390
that I
don't--

33:42.950 --> 33:45.020
I'm starting to
believe my own lies.

33:46.070 --> 33:47.510
I don't even remember who I was

33:47.545 --> 33:48.285
when we first met.

33:48.320 --> 33:51.790
And I want to find out.

34:04.030 --> 34:05.790
- You have the cure.
- Yeah.

34:07.760 --> 34:09.909
And I can shove this
down Klaus's throat

34:09.945 --> 34:10.565
and try to kill him,

34:10.600 --> 34:12.670
but even if I manage to do it...

34:14.780 --> 34:16.010
I'd lose you.

34:17.420 --> 34:19.159
And I don't want that to happen.

34:20.179 --> 34:22.570
How do I know this
isn't another lie?

34:23.679 --> 34:26.100
Katherine Pierce
deceiving yet another man.

34:26.489 --> 34:29.139
Because I meant what I said

34:29.480 --> 34:31.340
about my feelings for you.

34:31.639 --> 34:33.320
And I'd like to think

34:33.940 --> 34:36.000
that you feel
something for me, too.

34:39.300 --> 34:41.070
I need you to trust me.

34:42.750 --> 34:44.500
I want you to trust me...

34:44.949 --> 34:46.810
Just like I'm trusting you.

34:48.239 --> 34:49.830
You don't owe me anything.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.085
I'm gonna let you decide

34:54.120 --> 34:55.290
where we go from here.

35:24.860 --> 35:26.175
You and Katherine?

35:26.210 --> 35:27.970
And I thought you
were the smart brother.

35:28.005 --> 35:29.705
You don't have a smart brother.

35:29.740 --> 35:32.200
It turns out I'm just as
stupid as the rest of you.

35:32.290 --> 35:34.175
Why don't you just give me the cure

35:34.210 --> 35:36.060
so I can judge you
silently elsewhere?

35:37.660 --> 35:39.770
And what could you
possibly want with the cure?

35:42.000 --> 35:43.460
I want to be human again.

35:47.880 --> 35:49.320
How do you know that being human is

35:49.355 --> 35:51.040
the answer you're looking for?

35:51.270 --> 35:53.480
I mean, it's nothing
but a romantic notion.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.480
The grass won't
necessarily be greener,

35:56.730 --> 35:57.515
Rebekah.

35:57.550 --> 35:58.880
You're probably right.

35:59.650 --> 36:01.110
But I don't care.

36:01.360 --> 36:05.270
I want to live a simple
life as a normal person.

36:05.305 --> 36:07.030
And when it ends, it ends.

36:08.030 --> 36:09.570
We've had 20 lifetimes together,

36:09.605 --> 36:11.240
Elijah. Isn't that enough?

36:11.330 --> 36:12.920
I just don't understand.

36:14.010 --> 36:16.930
I mean, why must you always
consider our family a burden?

36:18.780 --> 36:20.240
Always and forever.

36:21.230 --> 36:25.530
I mean, those words are as important
to me today as they ever were.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.650
You will always be my brother.

36:31.060 --> 36:32.970
And I will never stop loving you.

36:34.790 --> 36:38.670
But now it's time for me to live
and die the way that I choose,

36:39.470 --> 36:41.730
not the way you and Nik want me to.

36:42.890 --> 36:44.140
Please.

36:46.050 --> 36:47.940
Please just give me the cure.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.145
What do you want, Nik?

36:54.180 --> 36:57.060
An update on our search
for the elusive cure.

36:57.380 --> 37:00.830
Let's just say that things
have gotten complicated.

37:01.570 --> 37:04.850
In fact, why don't you speak to
one of those complications? Here.

37:08.830 --> 37:10.370
Complication speaking.

37:13.300 --> 37:14.510
Big brother.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.210
At last you join the fray.

37:16.245 --> 37:17.820
Somebody had to take charge.

37:18.660 --> 37:20.320
And now that I have,
I've got the cure

37:20.355 --> 37:21.980
and I'm bringing it
back to Mystic Falls.

37:22.540 --> 37:25.600
With a long list of
demands, I assume.

37:25.700 --> 37:27.030
Not that long.

37:28.690 --> 37:29.930
Come home, brother.

37:31.290 --> 37:33.210
We'll settle this like family.

37:36.220 --> 37:38.580
I used all your bleach.

37:40.420 --> 37:43.390
Thank you for helping me.

37:43.450 --> 37:44.460
Yeah.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.730
Well, if you need anything else...

37:51.970 --> 37:53.535
don't call me.

37:53.570 --> 37:55.060
I have a prom to plan.

37:56.140 --> 37:57.950
Friends then?

38:04.180 --> 38:06.540
Are you gonna let Tyler
come back into town?

38:12.780 --> 38:14.370
You might have noticed...

38:15.670 --> 38:20.140
I'm not exactly scouring
the earth for him, am I?

38:34.920 --> 38:36.040
All right. You're right.

38:36.075 --> 38:37.160
I let Rebekah take the cure.

38:38.490 --> 38:39.705
I thought
for a second--

38:39.740 --> 38:41.510
I mean, literally
just a second--

38:41.640 --> 38:44.390
if Rebekah takes this, then
all my problems go away.

38:44.510 --> 38:45.980
And I couldn't think
of one good reason

38:46.015 --> 38:47.460
to give it to Elena.

38:49.200 --> 38:50.650
And then Rebekah took it.

38:50.780 --> 38:54.120
And I realized how
badly I screwed up.

38:54.570 --> 38:56.720
So what's your point, Damon?

38:56.755 --> 38:58.835
My point is, I'm sorry, ok?

38:58.870 --> 39:01.550
I had a moment of weakness, Stefan.

39:01.585 --> 39:02.940
It's my thing.

39:03.690 --> 39:05.380
It's like you and I
falling for the same girl.

39:05.415 --> 39:06.740
It's our thing.

39:07.310 --> 39:08.730
Was our thing.

39:10.700 --> 39:13.640
Look, we've been making the
same mistakes for 150 years.

39:13.675 --> 39:14.785
We can judge Katherine all we want,

39:14.820 --> 39:17.760
but we keep repeating our
own history just like she is.

39:17.960 --> 39:21.050
Nothing ever changes.
It has to stop, Damon.

39:21.085 --> 39:21.930
What are you talking about?

39:21.965 --> 39:23.170
I'm done.

39:23.280 --> 39:25.830
I can't keep reliving
my life like this.

39:25.865 --> 39:28.380
I owe Elena her shot
at being normal again.

39:28.480 --> 39:29.970
Once we give her the cure,

39:30.040 --> 39:32.980
I'm getting her out of my life
and I'm getting a life of my own.

39:35.360 --> 39:36.205
Okay.

39:36.240 --> 39:37.520
Okay, let's just...get the cure

39:37.555 --> 39:38.345
and then we'll talk about

39:38.380 --> 39:41.110
you riding off into the
sunset all by you lonesome.

39:43.090 --> 39:44.590
You still want to get the cure.

39:45.100 --> 39:46.930
Even if that means
you might lose her.

39:51.760 --> 39:53.880
It's a chance I'm
willing to take, Stefan.

39:57.640 --> 40:00.110
Guess all we have to
do is convince her.

40:08.650 --> 40:10.100
Sit anywhere you like.

40:23.380 --> 40:24.480
You all right?

40:27.880 --> 40:29.680
What's up with the
silent treatment.

40:29.790 --> 40:32.150
You are the one that text
us, wanted to meet up.

40:32.500 --> 40:34.130
You know I don't want the cure.

40:36.860 --> 40:38.785
You need to know that I never will

40:38.820 --> 40:40.710
and I'm done talking
about it. So...

40:41.360 --> 40:42.810
Will you accept that?

40:42.960 --> 40:45.390
And let me be who I am or not.

40:46.990 --> 40:50.080
Yeah, no.

40:50.660 --> 40:52.270
Elena, this isn't you.

40:52.305 --> 40:53.495
It is now.

40:53.530 --> 40:55.870
And you two really
need to accept it.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.590
'Cause if you don't,
there will be consequences.

41:02.640 --> 41:06.250
Listen, I was in the exact same
situation that you are in right now.

41:06.285 --> 41:08.597
My emotions were off, I wasn't me.

41:08.632 --> 41:10.910
And you refuse to accept that.

41:13.150 --> 41:14.710
You didn't give up on me.

41:14.870 --> 41:17.180
You didn't stop until
you pull me back.

41:23.350 --> 41:24.830
Let me just top that up for you.

41:24.840 --> 41:25.920
Thanks.

41:30.700 --> 41:33.735
Like I said, consequences.

41:33.770 --> 41:35.790
That's one body you
are responsible for.

41:35.825 --> 41:37.070
If you keep trying to fix me,

41:37.105 --> 41:38.015
there'll be a second,

41:38.050 --> 41:40.580
a twentieth, and a hundred.

41:43.150 --> 41:44.520
It's your choice.

41:52.960 --> 41:55.400
Still want to riding
off into the sunset?
