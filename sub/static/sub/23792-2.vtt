40:24.297 --> 40:27.133
Oh, Jack.

40:27.133 --> 40:31.137
Well, the book did say
the wishing tree is magical.

40:31.137 --> 40:33.181
Maybe miracles do happen.

40:33.181 --> 40:36.059
Maybe they do.

40:40.313 --> 40:42.023
Come on, Abigail.

40:42.023 --> 40:44.276
I'll make you a glass
of my special egg nog.

40:44.276 --> 40:46.778
[LAUGHS]
Merry Christmas, you two.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.154
BOTH: Merry Christmas.

40:48.154 --> 40:50.448
Jack...
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.409
Tomorrow, Bill.

40:52.409 --> 40:55.245
[♪♪♪]

40:56.329 --> 40:57.914
Oh.

40:57.914 --> 41:00.499
Merry Christmas,
Elizabeth.

41:00.499 --> 41:02.543
Oh, it will be now.

41:05.380 --> 41:08.341

41:26.734 --> 41:29.946
