00:02.785 --> 00:04.091
Hey, whatcha doing?

00:04.134 --> 00:06.093
Improving
our wedding photos.

00:06.136 --> 00:07.529
Oh, that'’s nice.

00:07.572 --> 00:10.227
Wait, I'’m still in them, right?

00:10.271 --> 00:12.447
Of course.
And not only you.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.579
I'’ve added some guests
who couldn'’t be there.

00:15.972 --> 00:17.974
Who'’s that next
to my father?

00:18.018 --> 00:20.063
The Wright brothers.

00:20.107 --> 00:22.109
And why are they at our wedding?

00:22.152 --> 00:23.936
Orville, because I admire him;

00:23.980 --> 00:25.677
Wilbur, because he was
Orville'’s plus-one.

00:27.157 --> 00:29.072
[computer chimes]Oh.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.987
You got an e-mail
from someone named Tam.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.858
Tam? What does hewant?

00:32.902 --> 00:34.817
Uh...

00:34.860 --> 00:37.820
looks like he'’s coming to give
his son a tour of Caltech.

00:37.863 --> 00:39.517
He'’s hoping you guys
can meet up.

00:39.561 --> 00:41.345
[scoffs]
He would like that, wouldn'’t he?

00:41.389 --> 00:43.913
Well, that is the gist
of the e-mail.

00:45.088 --> 00:46.089
Who'’s Tam?

00:46.133 --> 00:47.482
He was my best friend

00:47.525 --> 00:49.440
in the whole world growing up.

00:49.484 --> 00:52.095
Really? Why have I never
heard you mention him before?

00:52.139 --> 00:54.489
Oh, of course I have.
I'’m sure I've mentioned him,

00:54.532 --> 00:55.881
like, five times this week.

00:55.925 --> 00:57.579
I don'’t think you have.

00:57.622 --> 01:00.060
Tam! Tam! Tam! Tam! Tam!
There, it'’s only Thursday.

01:03.454 --> 01:06.196

milk, I bought the crazy cow.

01:37.923 --> 01:39.186
Yeah.

01:39.229 --> 01:41.884
Tell us the truth.
Did she get you pregnant?

01:41.927 --> 01:43.668
Very funny.

01:43.712 --> 01:45.540
Guys, I need your help, okay?
I'’m trying

01:45.583 --> 01:46.758
to buy her
engagement ring.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.064
What do you
think of this?

01:48.108 --> 01:49.587
Do you think she'’ll
like this one?

01:49.631 --> 01:51.937
Well, it'’s hard to say,
not knowing much about her.

01:51.981 --> 01:53.417
Does she have fingers?

01:54.418 --> 01:55.767
Yes, she has ten fingers

01:55.811 --> 01:57.943
and ten toes.
Probably.

01:57.987 --> 02:00.642
I'’ll get back to you
after I see her in sandals.

02:00.685 --> 02:03.123
Hey, did you guys know
that Sheldon had

02:03.166 --> 02:05.647
a best friend growing up
named Tam?

02:05.690 --> 02:08.780
Was that the imaginary
talking koala?

02:08.824 --> 02:12.219
No. He'’s a real person
who apparently betrayed him.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.525
Yeah, so did the koala.

02:14.569 --> 02:16.701
I tried to ask him
about it,

02:16.745 --> 02:18.703
and he invoked section three,
article five

02:18.747 --> 02:21.445
of the marriage contract:
beeswax comma none of your.

02:22.925 --> 02:24.448
I can'’t pry.
I mean,

02:24.492 --> 02:26.015
I have to respect his wishes.

02:26.058 --> 02:28.713
Wow. I wonder
what that guy could'’ve done

02:28.757 --> 02:31.673
to make Sheldon
not talk to him for 20 years.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.457
I wonder if it'’d work
a second time.

02:36.330 --> 02:37.983
[video game sound effects][knocking]

02:38.027 --> 02:40.856
I'’m pumping!

02:40.899 --> 02:42.118
It'’s Penny.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.511
Oh. Come in.

02:43.554 --> 02:45.904
I thought you were pumping.

02:45.948 --> 02:48.298
I thought you were my boss.

02:48.342 --> 02:51.867
Okay, listen, I'’m really worried
about this whole Raj thing.I know,

02:51.910 --> 02:53.912
he'’s so desperate
to get married, which is weird,

02:53.956 --> 02:57.351
because I can'’t imagine
we make it look that great.I know, right? You know,

02:57.394 --> 02:58.613
if this woman'’s
gonna be around, I think

02:58.656 --> 02:59.918
we should check her out
a little.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.703
I looked online.
She doesn'’t have an Instagram,

03:01.746 --> 03:04.227
which means she'’s either 80
or something'’s wrong with her.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.534
Well, I could ask my dad.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.623
Maybe he can get some
of his old cop buddies

03:08.666 --> 03:10.494
to do a background
check on her.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.148
Would he do that?Of course.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.542
He'’s a retired cop
who plays by his own rules.

03:16.587 --> 03:17.458
Hi, Daddy.

03:17.501 --> 03:18.459
No, everything'’s good.

03:18.502 --> 03:19.895
I just have a favor to ask.

03:19.938 --> 03:21.244
Yeah, so, my friend Raj

03:21.288 --> 03:22.941
is marrying this woman
that he barely knows,

03:22.985 --> 03:24.900
and I wanted to see if you
could use your connections

03:24.943 --> 03:26.118
to dig up any dirt on her.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.685
Uh-huh.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.034
Sure.

03:29.078 --> 03:31.950
Okay. Love you.

03:31.994 --> 03:34.997
Is he in?Absolutely not. He won'’t do it.
It'’s totally illegal.

03:35.040 --> 03:38.740
I thought you said
he played by his own rules.

03:38.783 --> 03:40.220
He does, but apparently,
they'’re very similar

03:40.263 --> 03:41.699
to the actual rules.

03:44.398 --> 03:46.443
I still can'’t believe
Sheldon had a best friend

03:46.487 --> 03:47.488
we'’ve never
heard about.

03:47.531 --> 03:50.926
Ooh, somebody'’s jealous.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.276
I'’m not jealous.Leonard,

03:53.320 --> 03:55.931
this is a safe space--
it'’s okay to be vulnerable.

03:55.974 --> 03:57.585
All I'’m saying is

03:57.628 --> 04:00.152
you know the timing
of a fellow'’s bowel movements,

04:00.196 --> 04:02.677
you don'’t think there's
a lot left to discover.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.115
I wonder what Tam
could have done.

04:06.158 --> 04:08.204
Hmm. Well, if Sheldon doesn'’t
want to talk about it,

04:08.248 --> 04:09.858
it'’s got to be
pretty upsetting.

04:09.901 --> 04:12.556
I have his brother George'’s
number-- he might know.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.036
Really?
You have George'’s number?

04:14.079 --> 04:16.168
So so jealous.

04:19.389 --> 04:20.477
Yeah, sure, I remember Tam,

04:20.521 --> 04:23.872
Sheldon'’s little Vietnam buddy.

04:23.915 --> 04:26.266
The two of them were
always running around together.

04:26.309 --> 04:27.354
So, what happened?

04:27.397 --> 04:28.616
What do you mean?

04:28.659 --> 04:30.531
Well, I mean, Sheldon
never talks about him.

04:30.574 --> 04:32.576
They haven'’t spoken in years.
He wasn'’t at the wedding.

04:32.620 --> 04:33.925
He wasn'’t?

04:33.969 --> 04:35.536
All right, well,
this is embarrassing,

04:35.579 --> 04:37.364
'’cause I had a long conversation

04:37.407 --> 04:40.192
with someone
who I thought was Tam.

04:40.236 --> 04:43.370
Wait, wait, so you don'’t know
what their fight was about?

04:43.413 --> 04:44.806
I wish I could help you, boys.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.982
But, you know,
Sheldon used to keep

04:47.025 --> 04:49.332
an enemies list
when he was a kid.

04:49.376 --> 04:50.333
Oh, he still does.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.334
Really? I figured

04:51.378 --> 04:52.335
that went the same way

04:52.379 --> 04:54.119
as his bathroom schedule.

04:54.163 --> 04:57.340
If you mean digitized, annotated
and put online, it did.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.647
Maybe that'’ll tell you
something.

04:59.690 --> 05:02.737
Hey, while you'’re looking at it,
if I'’m still on there

05:02.780 --> 05:04.347
for peeing
in his shampoo bottle...

05:04.391 --> 05:06.306
Eh, you know what,
just leave it.

05:06.349 --> 05:08.786
[laughs] See ya, boys.Bye.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.527
Bye.All right,
got his enemies list.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.312
Ooh, he updated
the interface.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.878
You can search
by first name,

05:13.922 --> 05:16.751
last name or length of grudge.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.274
Is Tam on it?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.928
Let'’s see.

05:19.971 --> 05:21.756
Yep. Right here.
Tam Nguyen.

05:21.799 --> 05:23.714
Oh, great. What did he do?Hold on.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.716
I have to agree
to the terms of service.

05:27.457 --> 05:29.198
No, I'’m not a robot.

05:30.242 --> 05:31.592
Okay.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.681
"Which of these are plants?"

05:33.724 --> 05:35.204
And we'’re in.

05:35.247 --> 05:36.945
Great. What-what
does it say?

05:36.988 --> 05:38.381
Well...

05:38.425 --> 05:40.078
"He knows what he did."

05:40.122 --> 05:41.776
[chuckles]:
Oh, come on.

05:41.819 --> 05:44.387
Wait. Wait, wait,
wait, if Tam knows

05:44.431 --> 05:46.389
what he did, we
can just ask him.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.609
He'’s gonna be on campus tomorrow
showing his son around.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.001
Won'’t that make Sheldon mad?

05:50.045 --> 05:51.525
Everything makes
Sheldon mad.

05:51.568 --> 05:53.527
Yeah.
Look at his list.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.442
Jim Henson for, quote,

05:55.485 --> 05:58.358
"putting a terrifying,
giant yellow bird on television

05:58.401 --> 06:01.056
and in my nightmares."

06:05.190 --> 06:07.976
Oh, this is so nice.Mm-hmm.

06:08.019 --> 06:10.544
Maybe instead of introducing
ourselves to Anu,

06:10.587 --> 06:12.459
we could just get a room,

06:12.502 --> 06:14.635
order some food and take a nap.

06:14.678 --> 06:16.724
Yeah, I'’ve fallen
for that line before.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.508
It never leads
to napping.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.902
That must be her.

06:20.945 --> 06:23.426
Oh. She'’s cute.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.602
Okay, I got you two seats
to Hamiltontonight.

06:25.646 --> 06:27.604
Your tickets will be
at the concierge desk.

06:27.648 --> 06:29.214
Of course.
My pleasure.

06:29.258 --> 06:31.086
May I help you?

06:31.129 --> 06:32.479
Yes, I'’m here to pick up
our Hamiltontickets.

06:32.522 --> 06:34.655
Stop.

06:35.917 --> 06:36.918
Hi. We'’re Raj's friends.

06:36.961 --> 06:38.441
I'’m Penny.
This is Bernadette.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.574
We just came by to
introduce ourselves.

06:40.617 --> 06:42.097
So you came to check me out?

06:42.140 --> 06:45.143
She'’s smart.
I like her.

06:45.187 --> 06:46.449
We just want to see
if we could take you

06:46.493 --> 06:47.798
to dinner
and get to know you a bit.

06:47.842 --> 06:50.018
That sounds nice.
How about tonight after work?

06:50.061 --> 06:51.889
Maybe we can go to Bavel.

06:51.933 --> 06:54.239
Oh, I wish. That place is
impossible to get into.

06:54.283 --> 06:56.241
Oh, please.
Getting into impossible places

06:56.285 --> 06:57.982
is my superpower.

06:58.026 --> 06:59.288
BERNADETTE:
Me, too.

06:59.331 --> 07:02.857
I can fit my whole body
in our dryer.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.902
All set. 8:30.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.730
Wow. Okay, well,
we'’ll see you tonight.

07:06.774 --> 07:07.818
See you then.Okay.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.167
Bye.

07:09.211 --> 07:11.343
She can get
into any restaurant,

07:11.387 --> 07:14.695
but the best husband
she can find is Raj?

07:18.089 --> 07:19.656
Not Tam.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.006
Not Tam.

07:23.138 --> 07:25.053
Not Tam.

07:25.096 --> 07:27.272
Got him.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.666
Tam Nguyen?Yeah. Yes.

07:29.710 --> 07:32.016
Is my son done
with his tour?

07:32.060 --> 07:35.803
No idea. We'’re actually
friends of Sheldon Cooper.

07:35.846 --> 07:37.587
Oh, I'’ve been trying
to get in touch with him,

07:37.631 --> 07:39.067
but I never heard back.
Is he okay?

07:39.110 --> 07:41.112
Well, if you mean
physically, yes.

07:41.156 --> 07:43.898
If you mean
every other way, no.

07:43.941 --> 07:45.552
So, is he here?LEONARD:
Uh, no.

07:45.595 --> 07:46.683
He-he didn'’t come.

07:46.727 --> 07:48.119
He'’s, uh...

07:48.163 --> 07:50.818
he'’s still pretty
upset about...

07:50.861 --> 07:52.472
you know.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.082
I know what?

07:54.125 --> 07:55.562
Come on,

07:55.605 --> 07:57.259
you-you must know.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.783
No, we haven'’t talked in,
like, 20 years.

07:59.827 --> 08:02.177
Right. Because...

08:02.220 --> 08:03.918
you know.

08:04.962 --> 08:07.574
I don'’t think
he knows.

08:07.617 --> 08:09.271
What are you guys talking about?

08:09.314 --> 08:11.621
Why did you and Sheldon
stop being friends?

08:11.665 --> 08:13.362
What did you do?And don'’t worry,

08:13.405 --> 08:14.798
even though we
just met you,

08:14.842 --> 08:17.497
we think you'’re right
and he'’s wrong.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.150
I didn'’t do anything.

08:19.194 --> 08:21.936
He moved to California,
and we just drifted apart.

08:21.979 --> 08:24.199
Oh, come on, there'’s
got to be something...

08:24.242 --> 08:26.201
What is going on here?Oh, hey, Sheldon.

08:26.244 --> 08:28.638
We just met...Sheldon! So good to see you!

08:28.682 --> 08:30.379
Tam.

08:31.728 --> 08:33.556
It'’s been a long time.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.037
Mm, not long enough
to erase the sting of betrayal.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.560
How did I betray you?

08:37.604 --> 08:39.431
You know what you did.

08:39.475 --> 08:41.390
Uh, let me
catch you up.

08:41.433 --> 08:42.783
He does not.

08:44.219 --> 08:46.569
When I moved to California,
what did you do?

08:46.613 --> 08:48.049
I stayed in Texas.

08:48.092 --> 08:49.616
Do you believe this guy?!

08:53.620 --> 08:56.405
So, he was your best friend
growing up?

08:56.448 --> 08:57.624
Yes.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.539
Were there no other kids
in Texas?

09:07.634 --> 09:10.332
Hey. What is
going on with you?

09:10.375 --> 09:12.421
I don'’t want to talk about it.Well,

09:12.464 --> 09:14.379
I'’m sure you have
a perfectly stupid reason.

09:15.772 --> 09:17.905
I don'’t do anything
for a stupid reason.

09:17.948 --> 09:20.168
Except, perhaps,
Talk Like a Pirate Day,

09:20.211 --> 09:22.866
and I'’d argue that's
more whimsical than stupid.

09:22.910 --> 09:25.782
You know, I was curious to find
out what Tam had done wrong.

09:25.826 --> 09:28.132
Why am I not surprised
the answer is nothing?

09:28.176 --> 09:30.004
So you'’re taking his side.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.658
You scurvy dog.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.618
You watch yourself.
There is room on my enemies list

09:35.662 --> 09:37.141
now that the cafeteria ladies
finally told me

09:37.185 --> 09:38.360
what'’s in the chili.

09:39.491 --> 09:41.450
By the way, don'’t eat the chili.

09:41.493 --> 09:42.799
Wai-Wai-Wait, you know what?

09:42.843 --> 09:45.149
Do.

09:45.193 --> 09:47.108
Be careful, Sheldon.

09:47.151 --> 09:49.240
I don'’t think you can afford
to lose a second best friend.

09:49.284 --> 09:51.460
I don'’t see anyone lining up
to be your third.

09:51.503 --> 09:53.810
D... Wait.

09:53.854 --> 09:56.596
"Snarky comebacks..."

09:56.639 --> 09:58.598
Oh, here we go.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.643
"You have your entire life
to be a jerk,

10:00.687 --> 10:03.124
why not take today off?"

10:07.432 --> 10:10.566
That was harsh,
but he was asking for it.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.787
This place is amazing.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.223
I can'’t believe
you got us in here.

10:15.266 --> 10:16.833
Well, it'’s kind of my job.

10:16.877 --> 10:19.531
Usually I get tipped for it,
but I'’ll leave that up to you.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.751
[giggles]

10:21.795 --> 10:23.013
Look, I think that'’s
LeBron over there.

10:23.057 --> 10:24.275
James?

10:24.319 --> 10:25.494
No, LeBron Kershenbaum.

10:27.539 --> 10:28.976
So, what do you want to know?

10:29.019 --> 10:32.153
Well, you seem like a
smart, successful woman,

10:32.196 --> 10:34.372
why would you want to marry
someone you just met?

10:34.416 --> 10:36.244
Fair question.

10:36.287 --> 10:38.681
In my 20s, I tried this
the normal way.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.335
You know, met a guy,
fell in love,

10:40.378 --> 10:42.119
we moved in together.

10:42.163 --> 10:44.687
I put him through culinary
school, screenwriting classes,

10:44.731 --> 10:47.908
and finally dumped him when he
wanted to become a midwife.

10:47.951 --> 10:49.866
Then I realized,

10:49.910 --> 10:52.521
my parents are happy;
they had an arranged marriage.

10:52.564 --> 10:54.523
Why am I fighting this?

10:54.566 --> 10:56.525
I dunno, I married for love

10:56.568 --> 11:00.572
and it turned out... fine.

11:02.487 --> 11:05.447
Oh, yeah, me, too.

11:08.145 --> 11:09.538
AMY:
Hi.

11:09.581 --> 11:12.367
Howard, today
is your lucky day.

11:12.410 --> 11:13.934
Leonard'’s out, you're my new
best friend.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.719
Well, I'’m not
thrilled about it either,

11:16.763 --> 11:17.981
but here we are.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.679
Okay, fine.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.028
Is Bernadette there?

11:21.071 --> 11:22.029
Sh... No.

11:22.072 --> 11:23.639
Just Stuart?

11:23.683 --> 11:25.815
Let me call you back.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.121
Let me guess.

11:27.164 --> 11:28.731
This thing with Tam escalated,

11:28.775 --> 11:29.993
and now you'’re mad at Leonard

11:30.037 --> 11:31.516
and looking for
a new best friend?

11:31.560 --> 11:33.518
You know me so well.

11:33.562 --> 11:35.607
It'’s too bad you can't be
my best friend.

11:35.651 --> 11:37.392
I can be.

11:37.435 --> 11:39.742
You can'’t be my wife
and my best friend.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.613
Who would I complain
about you to?

11:41.657 --> 11:44.138
Just tell me what happened.

11:44.181 --> 11:47.794
Leonard talked to Tam behind
my back and took his side.

11:47.837 --> 11:50.057
And after what he did to me.
Can you believe it?

11:50.100 --> 11:53.277
No. I'’m-I'm shocked
and outraged.

11:53.321 --> 11:55.845
Now, tell me why
I'’m shocked and outraged.

11:55.889 --> 11:58.761
Fine.

11:58.805 --> 12:01.546
When I got accepted
to grad school at Caltech,

12:01.590 --> 12:03.940
I was afraid to move
so far away from home.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.942
So Tam said
he'’d move out here with me

12:05.986 --> 12:07.683
and be my roommate.
Then,

12:07.727 --> 12:09.772
over the summer,
he got a girlfriend,

12:09.816 --> 12:11.252
even after reading
all the pamphlets

12:11.295 --> 12:14.342
I gave him
about social diseases.

12:14.385 --> 12:17.519
Aw, I remember when you
gave me those pamphlets.

12:17.562 --> 12:19.869
Anyway, Tam stayed
with her in Texas,

12:19.913 --> 12:22.524
and I had to move out here
all by myself.

12:22.567 --> 12:25.092
That must'’ve been scary.

12:25.135 --> 12:27.050
It was.

12:27.094 --> 12:28.748
I was lonely, and I thought

12:28.791 --> 12:30.619
I'’d never make a friend again.

12:30.662 --> 12:33.187
And for a long time, I didn'’t.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.275
But then you did.

12:34.318 --> 12:36.364
And great friends.

12:36.407 --> 12:39.454
If you think about it, if Tam
had moved out here with you,

12:39.497 --> 12:41.761
who knows what your life
would'’ve been like.

12:48.158 --> 12:49.899
Yes.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.553
Uh, I'’m Leonard Hofstadter.
I called you

12:51.596 --> 12:52.902
about the apartment.
You said...

12:52.946 --> 12:54.599
Tell him to go away.
You already have a roommate.

12:57.864 --> 12:58.778
New neighbor?

12:59.822 --> 13:00.823
Oh, hi.

13:00.867 --> 13:01.955
Hi.Hi.

13:01.998 --> 13:04.305
Hi.Hi.

13:14.619 --> 13:15.577
PENNY:
Tam, look.

13:15.620 --> 13:18.406
Sheldon'’s hugging me.

13:18.449 --> 13:20.712
It'’s a Saturnalia miracle.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.020
Sheldon, come here.

13:24.064 --> 13:25.848
Bazinga.

13:27.763 --> 13:30.331
No, my life
would'’ve still been great.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.989
So what is the craziest
request anyone'’s ever made?

13:36.032 --> 13:38.643
Oh, you know,
I can'’t really say.

13:38.687 --> 13:40.689
Concierge-guest confidentiality.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.125
Really, that'’s a thing?

13:42.169 --> 13:44.084
[laughs]
No.

13:44.127 --> 13:47.652
This one time, I had to go
to Walmart at 3:00 a.m.

13:47.696 --> 13:50.438
because Britney Spears
needed to blow bubbles.

13:50.481 --> 13:53.528
Oh.That is so cool.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.704
By the way, do not tell Raj
that you met Britney Spears,

13:55.747 --> 13:57.010
because he will literally die.

13:59.099 --> 14:01.492
We'’ve been talking so much
about me,

14:01.536 --> 14:03.755
tell me about Raj.

14:03.799 --> 14:04.974
Okay, are you trying
to get us drunk

14:05.018 --> 14:06.758
so we'’ll dish on
our friend?

14:06.802 --> 14:08.760
'’Cause it's totally gonna work,
what do you want to know?

14:10.588 --> 14:11.633
What kind of guy is he?

14:11.676 --> 14:13.113
He is great.

14:13.156 --> 14:14.331
So great.Mm-hmm.

14:14.375 --> 14:15.680
How come he'’s still single?

14:17.900 --> 14:20.250
He'’s great.So great. Yeah.

14:20.294 --> 14:21.556
Come on.

14:21.599 --> 14:22.862
There'’s really nothing
to tell.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.167
Raj is so much fun
to hang out with.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.734
He'’s like one
of our girlfriends.

14:25.777 --> 14:27.214
And I mean that in a good way.

14:27.257 --> 14:29.259
But also a bad way.

14:29.303 --> 14:30.652
Anything else?

14:31.827 --> 14:34.047
No.No.

14:34.090 --> 14:36.353
I mean, h-he
takes baths with his dog,

14:36.397 --> 14:38.834
but not in a weird way.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.141
Or a normal way;
they both wear swimsuits.

14:42.751 --> 14:46.015
He also cries every time
Hugh Jackman sings.

14:46.059 --> 14:49.062
But not cute sniffles--
full-on snot sobs.

14:50.454 --> 14:51.891
But he is great.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.370
So great.Yeah.

14:56.460 --> 14:57.635
[knocking]

14:57.679 --> 14:58.941
Hello, Sheldon.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.943
Hello Tam.
Thank you for coming.

15:00.987 --> 15:04.468
I just want you to know
that, um...

15:04.512 --> 15:06.688
I forgive you.

15:06.731 --> 15:07.515
I didn'’t do anything.

15:07.558 --> 15:08.733
And yet, here I am,

15:08.777 --> 15:11.301
still being the bigger man.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.564
Look, I was in love with Beth,

15:13.608 --> 15:15.044
and she made me happy.

15:15.088 --> 15:16.480
Y... Really?

15:16.524 --> 15:17.873
Did shelet you play
with her train set?

15:19.875 --> 15:21.877
In a manner of speaking.

15:24.662 --> 15:27.578
Sheldon, I needed
to stay in Texas.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.058
And you needed
to come here.

15:29.102 --> 15:31.278
I knew you were gonna
do amazing things,

15:31.321 --> 15:33.628
and meet amazing people
who were gonna respect you,

15:33.671 --> 15:35.717
because you'’re brilliant.
And because they never had to

15:35.760 --> 15:38.589
fish you out of a dumpster.

15:38.633 --> 15:39.851
Well, they have,
but it was during

15:39.895 --> 15:42.332
my short-lived parkour phase.

15:42.376 --> 15:45.292
I didn'’t mean to upset you.

15:45.335 --> 15:46.858
And I want you to know
I'’m really proud

15:46.902 --> 15:48.425
of everything you'’ve done.

15:48.469 --> 15:50.427
Thank you.

15:50.471 --> 15:52.864
It did work out for me.

15:52.908 --> 15:56.520
And I'’m sorry that things
didn'’t work out for you.

15:56.564 --> 15:58.479
They did work out for me.

15:58.522 --> 16:01.438
Oh, Tam, you don'’t need
to be brave on my account.

16:01.482 --> 16:03.092
I'’m not.

16:03.136 --> 16:05.573
I have a great wife
and amazing children.

16:05.616 --> 16:06.922
I'’m very happy.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.750
Brave, brave Tam.

16:12.536 --> 16:14.408
Sounds like Penny and
Bernadette had fun last night.

16:14.451 --> 16:15.887
I know.

16:15.931 --> 16:17.237
Bernie came home pretty drunk.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.413
She tried to sleep in the dryer.

16:21.893 --> 16:25.419
Hello, you all remember Tam,
my best friend from high school.

16:25.462 --> 16:26.942
Yeah.
Of course.How'’s it going?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.336
Sheldon'’s been showing
me and my son around.

16:29.379 --> 16:31.512
Now we know where all
the clean bathrooms are.Yep.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.167
You just remember the mnemonic:

16:34.210 --> 16:35.733
if it'’s number one,
the library'’s fun,

16:35.777 --> 16:37.561
if it'’s number two,
the basement'’s for you.

16:39.389 --> 16:40.564
I'’m glad you guys made up.

16:40.608 --> 16:43.045
Well, I realized my life
turned out great,

16:43.089 --> 16:44.873
and it'’s silly
to hold a grudge.

16:44.916 --> 16:46.744
And I had no idea we were
fighting, so it was easy.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.443
Uh, don'’t worry, Leonard,

16:49.486 --> 16:51.575
you'’re still
my California best friend.

16:53.577 --> 16:55.231
Cool.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.755
So, what do you want to do now?

16:57.799 --> 17:00.497
Go to the train store,
go to the comic book store?

17:00.541 --> 17:02.630
Actually, I have to grab my
son and head to the airport.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.458
I was just about
to call a cab.

17:04.501 --> 17:06.329
Don'’t be silly,
you don'’t have to call a cab.

17:06.373 --> 17:07.765
You'’re my oldest friend.

17:07.809 --> 17:10.507
Leonard will take you.
Right, Leonard?

17:10.551 --> 17:13.119
Sure.

17:13.162 --> 17:14.381
Shall we?

17:14.424 --> 17:15.425
Eh, eh, eh, hold on.

17:15.469 --> 17:16.905
I haven'’t seen
Tam in 20 years,

17:16.948 --> 17:18.211
give me a chance
to say good-bye.

17:18.254 --> 17:20.039
Bye.

17:28.395 --> 17:30.223
Check it out--
LeBron James posted a picture

17:30.266 --> 17:31.572
of me and him
on Instagram.

17:31.615 --> 17:32.964
I don'’t see you.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.053
Look right behind him.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.619
No.

17:35.663 --> 17:38.057
Okay. You see that table
just past his left shoulder?

17:38.100 --> 17:41.190
Now go back two more tables
and over to the right.

17:41.234 --> 17:43.584
All I see is
a yellow smudge.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.629
That'’s me!

17:45.673 --> 17:47.588
[phone rings]

17:47.631 --> 17:49.024
Oh, it'’s Raj.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.157
Hey Raj,
I'’m here with Penny.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.898
KOOTHRAPPALI:
What the hell did you two
say to Anu?

17:53.942 --> 17:55.335
Uh...

17:55.378 --> 17:57.815
whatever do you mean?

17:57.859 --> 18:00.253
Why, why would you tell her

18:00.296 --> 18:02.429
I wear ladies'’ deodorant?

18:02.472 --> 18:06.128
Uh, because you'’re a boy
and it'’s really funny.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.783
Oh, oh, okay. Pardon me

18:08.826 --> 18:11.133
for having the confidence
to smell daisy-fresh.

18:12.439 --> 18:14.658
Just do me a favor
and stay away from her.

18:16.530 --> 18:19.141
Ugh, God, now I feel bad.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.490
I know.

18:20.534 --> 18:22.057
Maybe we should
take her out again
