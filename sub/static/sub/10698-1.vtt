Welcome to WWE City.

00:46.980 --> 00:50.715
Take the next exit because
it's just that good.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.617
I'm The Miz, and I'm awesome.

00:52.619 --> 00:54.052
Who's awesome? I'm awesome.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.020
Who's awesome? I'm awesome.

00:56.022 --> 00:57.789
Who's awesome? I'm awesome.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.490
Who's awesome? I'm awesome.

00:59.492 --> 01:01.859
Who's awesome? I am... uhh!

01:07.200 --> 01:09.033
Kane, you're back.

01:09.035 --> 01:13.171
I thought we'd never see you again
after you lost that last match.

01:16.376 --> 01:19.177
Not that I agreed with the decision.

01:21.781 --> 01:24.248
Not the face. Not the face.
Not the face.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.985
Welcome to WWE City.

01:27.987 --> 01:33.024
Take the next exit because
it's just that good.

01:35.628 --> 01:37.128
Whoa!

01:37.130 --> 01:38.664
Oof!

01:43.802 --> 01:47.939
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
You keep on going, Kane.

01:47.941 --> 01:51.075
You're lucky! You got
off easy this time.

01:56.849 --> 01:59.016
Who's awesome? I'm awesome.

01:59.018 --> 02:00.685
Who's awesome? I'm awesome.

02:00.687 --> 02:02.757
Who's awesome...

02:12.332 --> 02:14.665
Who's in there?
Is that you, Kane?

02:14.667 --> 02:17.235
Come on. Come on out and get some.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.382
Uhh!

02:36.623 --> 02:39.457
Uhh!

02:39.459 --> 02:41.125
That all you got, Yogi?

02:43.362 --> 02:46.164
Uhh! Uhh!

02:46.166 --> 02:50.101
My... my face!

02:51.871 --> 02:55.473
Welcome to WWE City.

02:55.475 --> 02:59.544
Take the next exit because
it's just that good.

02:59.546 --> 03:01.279
Good.

03:09.254 --> 03:10.788
Really?

03:13.692 --> 03:17.962
Ahh! No! No!

03:24.537 --> 03:27.305
Unnecessary roughness.

05:11.511 --> 05:14.745
Captioning made possible by Warner bros.
Animation

05:20.752 --> 05:23.654
Look out. John Cena is the
doctor of Thundernomics.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.324
Ha ha ha.

05:27.659 --> 05:29.193
He can't see me.

05:29.195 --> 05:31.095
You can't see me at all.

05:31.097 --> 05:33.564
Like, no one can touch John Cena.

05:33.566 --> 05:35.900
Sin Cara can.

05:36.602 --> 05:40.037
Scooby Dooby-doo!

05:42.307 --> 05:45.276
1, 2, 3.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.845
Sin Cara wins it.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.514
Way to go, Scooby-Doo, old buddy.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.917
Booyah. Dooby-doo.

05:52.919 --> 05:55.186
Congratulations.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.356
You just beat the game on
the hardest level ever...

05:58.358 --> 06:02.360
double triple beatdown extreme.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.529
But can you complete
the victory dance?

06:05.531 --> 06:09.335
Oh, yeah.
It's all yours, pal. You earned it.

06:48.006 --> 06:50.541
Perfect score!

06:50.543 --> 06:52.309
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!

06:54.413 --> 06:59.016
Hello there. I'm Vince McMahon,
chairman and CEO of WWE.

06:59.018 --> 07:01.719
Mr. McMahon.

07:01.721 --> 07:04.021
We're not worthy.

07:04.023 --> 07:06.023
Because you beat the
game on this level

07:06.025 --> 07:10.561
and executed a perfect score on the
victory dance, you win a special prize.

07:10.563 --> 07:12.329
We did?

07:12.331 --> 07:15.666
You've won an all-expense
paid trip to WWE City.

07:15.668 --> 07:20.671
Come revel in a place
dedicated to everything WWE.

07:20.973 --> 07:23.274
It'll be a week of
fun and excitement,

07:23.276 --> 07:28.312
culminating in ringside seats
at Wrestlemania. Don't miss it.

07:28.514 --> 07:30.981
Report to training camp in WWE City

07:30.983 --> 07:34.452
as soon as possible with this game disc
as proof of your win to claim your prize.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.353
Like, Wrestlemania.
Ha ha ha!

07:36.355 --> 07:38.689
You gotta be kidding me.
Think of it.

07:38.691 --> 07:40.724
The fun.
The fans.

07:40.726 --> 07:42.226
The food!

07:42.228 --> 07:46.096
We gotta go, old pal.
Like, we just gotta go.

07:47.032 --> 07:50.801
We gotta go.
Like, we just gotta go.

07:50.803 --> 07:55.906
It's the ultimate slamtastic
life-affirming experience of a lifetime.

07:55.908 --> 07:57.441
It's Wrestlemania.

07:57.443 --> 07:59.743
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:59.745 --> 08:02.980
Uh, I don't know, guys. It's not
something we're really into.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.649
And I have a lot of
reading to catch up on.

08:05.651 --> 08:09.019
Uh, no, thank you.
Like, come on, guys.

08:09.021 --> 08:12.656
Scoob and I never ask for anything.
Like, I can't count how many times

08:12.658 --> 08:16.427
the two of us were bait to catch
some crazy mask-wearing villain.

08:16.429 --> 08:17.695
Yeah.

08:17.697 --> 08:20.030
I got the photos to prove it.

08:21.967 --> 08:25.536
Take a good look, people.
Exhibit "A." Like, here's the time

08:25.538 --> 08:29.440
you guys made us dress like giant tools
to catch the monstrous mechanic.

08:29.442 --> 08:32.342
Or as ducks to catch
the horrific huntsman.

08:32.345 --> 08:37.381
Or when we had to be the cow to catch the
crazed cowgirl from beyond the grave.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.783
Scooby-Doo almost got milked.

08:39.784 --> 08:42.753
It was so humiliating.

08:44.256 --> 08:47.558
And the Piéce De Résistance,

08:47.560 --> 08:49.727
the time we posed
as señor Pepe Jose

08:49.729 --> 08:53.063
and the dancing hairless
Chihuahua Don Pero

08:53.065 --> 08:56.800
to catch the ghastly
Gordito of Guadalajara.

08:56.802 --> 09:00.771
Yeah, the hair didn't even
grow back in some places.

09:00.773 --> 09:03.240
Scooby was naked.
Look at him.

09:03.242 --> 09:05.843
Just look at him!
No, no. Ok.

09:05.845 --> 09:08.679
We get it.
You win, Shaggy.

09:09.949 --> 09:11.882
Win? Wait, what?

09:11.884 --> 09:14.818
I was actually thinking
about taking a trip anyway

09:14.820 --> 09:19.089
to try out my new allodium
Q-36 digital SLR camera

09:19.091 --> 09:20.991
and optical stabilizer zoom lens.

09:20.993 --> 09:23.894
Maybe I can snap some
action-packed pictures.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.529
And this will give
me an opportunity

09:25.531 --> 09:29.233
to explore the parallels between
the modern world of WWE

09:29.235 --> 09:31.201
vs. Ancient warrior customs.

09:31.203 --> 09:34.004
Besides, it beats another
weekend with grandpa Dinkley

09:34.006 --> 09:36.574
and his mysterious odor problem.

09:38.276 --> 09:41.445
Scooby-Doo almost got milked.

09:41.447 --> 09:44.481
The hair didn't even grow back

09:44.483 --> 09:46.850
in some places.

09:47.986 --> 09:51.522
Ok, we'll go to Wrestlemania.

09:51.524 --> 09:52.690
Whoo-hoo!

09:52.692 --> 09:55.693
WWE City, here we come.

09:55.695 --> 09:58.128
Oh, boy.

09:58.130 --> 10:01.231
Hee hee hee!

10:26.391 --> 10:30.361
Here comes the flying huna
caruna off the top ropes.

10:32.230 --> 10:33.797
Ha ha ha!

10:33.799 --> 10:37.901
And it's countered by Scooby's
patented corkscrew counter crunch.

10:37.903 --> 10:42.139
Um, exactly how many more
play-by-play Scooby snack attacks

10:42.141 --> 10:44.608
will we have to endure
before WWE City?

10:44.610 --> 10:46.410
Like, we brought everything we had.

10:46.412 --> 10:48.445
Scooby and I need to
keep our energy up

10:48.447 --> 10:51.448
so we can cheer like
crazy at the main event.

10:51.450 --> 10:54.685
There's so many boxes
I can't even see the luggage.

10:54.687 --> 10:58.088
Luggage?
You didn't pack the luggage?

10:58.090 --> 10:59.289
Ruh-roh.

10:59.291 --> 11:01.825
Of all the food-induced,
insane things

11:01.827 --> 11:04.928
you two have done, this
absolutely takes the cake.

11:04.930 --> 11:07.631
Mmm. Cake.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.334
I mean it.
Like, what's the big deal?

11:10.336 --> 11:13.704
We all wear the same outfits
every single day anyway.

11:13.706 --> 11:16.707
Well, you gotta admit it,
he does have a point.

11:16.709 --> 11:18.976
Hmph.

11:18.978 --> 11:20.411
Hey, look.

11:20.413 --> 11:24.915
Like, WWE City, next exit.

11:26.151 --> 11:27.818
Hold the phone!

11:48.606 --> 11:51.909
Looks like we're stuck.

11:51.911 --> 11:53.977
There's a car coming.

11:53.979 --> 11:55.913
Maybe they can help.

11:57.449 --> 12:00.951
Well, now, this ain't a
good place for a breakdown.

12:00.953 --> 12:04.121
Can we help you kids out?

12:04.123 --> 12:06.757
John Cena.

12:06.759 --> 12:08.659
Whoa.

12:08.661 --> 12:12.162
Ok. Looks like you kids
ran into some trouble.

12:12.164 --> 12:15.165
This ain't safe, champ.
We gotta keep moving.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.967
Calm down, cookie.

12:16.969 --> 12:19.770
I'm just saying that it's
dangerous out here at night,

12:19.772 --> 12:21.739
what with the bear trouble and all.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.607
That's why Ruben,
my nephew here,

12:23.609 --> 12:26.777
and I have been following the
superstars on their jogs.

12:28.146 --> 12:29.680
Hi.

12:29.682 --> 12:33.283
Well, these kids aren't going
anywhere while their van is stuck.

12:33.285 --> 12:34.818
This shouldn't take long.

12:34.820 --> 12:38.355
Uh, what's he gonna do,
lift the van out of the ditch?

12:55.840 --> 12:57.508
Scooby! Shaggy!

13:05.183 --> 13:07.484
Cool.

13:07.486 --> 13:10.521
I didn't know WWE
superstars were so hot.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.823
Strong! I mean strong.

13:19.998 --> 13:21.165
Grr!

13:24.936 --> 13:26.904
Scooby, no!

13:26.906 --> 13:28.038
Come back!

13:28.040 --> 13:30.240
Scooby! Scooby!

13:30.242 --> 13:32.376
Scoob, stop!

13:41.120 --> 13:42.986
Aah!

13:52.330 --> 13:55.966
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

14:01.807 --> 14:02.840
Zoinks!

14:02.842 --> 14:05.909
A mo... a mo... monster!

14:05.911 --> 14:08.879
Monster? Where?
Where?

14:11.282 --> 14:13.417
Oh, scoob!
Ha ha ha!

14:13.419 --> 14:15.419
You had me worried, pal.

14:15.421 --> 14:17.287
It's me.
It's you.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.525
Yikes!

14:25.865 --> 14:28.932
What are you two doing in my woods?

14:28.934 --> 14:31.501
Um, leaving.

14:31.503 --> 14:33.737
Cool down a bit, Bayard.

14:33.739 --> 14:37.674
The dog and the long haired
fella didn't mean to trespass.

14:37.676 --> 14:41.011
They're just fans come for the WWE.

14:41.013 --> 14:43.113
They all come for that.

14:43.115 --> 14:47.951
And the more they come, the
hungrier they make the beast.

14:47.953 --> 14:49.553
The beast?

14:49.555 --> 14:54.191
The beast called WWE City.

14:54.493 --> 14:59.530
Every day it eats up more
and more of our land.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.498
But not for long,

15:01.500 --> 15:04.635
'cause there's a storm a-coming,

15:04.637 --> 15:09.273
and we're gonna watch it
blow you all out of here

15:09.275 --> 15:12.977
like dead leaves.

15:19.217 --> 15:23.153
Now, get off my property.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.961
Oh, don't let old Bayard spook you.

15:30.963 --> 15:33.230
He's not what you
call a people person.

15:33.232 --> 15:35.132
Still, it's not right.

15:35.134 --> 15:39.069
Can I make it up to you by offering you
some VIP seats at our live event tonight?

15:39.071 --> 15:42.005
Would you be interested?
Would we?

15:57.755 --> 16:01.491
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:01.493 --> 16:05.595
welcome to WWE.

16:37.196 --> 16:40.197
Uhh!

16:49.507 --> 16:53.777
Ahh!

16:57.048 --> 16:58.515
Uhh!

17:20.805 --> 17:25.075
Like, pinch me,
I think I'm dreaming.

17:25.077 --> 17:26.209
Ow!

17:26.211 --> 17:28.078
I'm not dreaming.

17:28.079 --> 17:32.049
Boy, what an exciting tag team
match we have here tonight.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.785
The big show and Alberto del Rio

17:34.787 --> 17:39.056
are up against sin
Cara and John Cena.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.559
And Cena wastes no time
delivering an elbow to big show.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.761
Whoo-hoo! Yes!

17:44.763 --> 17:47.330
Big show with a chop.

17:47.332 --> 17:49.533
And del Rio blindsides Cena.

17:49.535 --> 17:53.070
That was a dirty move.
And I think the ref agrees.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.672
Oh, my goodness, Sin Cara's up.

17:55.674 --> 17:58.675
And he delivers high-flying
justice to del Rio.

17:58.677 --> 18:00.043
Whoo-hoo!
Heh heh heh!

18:00.045 --> 18:02.312
And it looks like the end for Cena.

18:02.314 --> 18:05.282
But somehow Cena reverses.
He's got big show up.

18:05.284 --> 18:08.652
Oh, no!
Look out!

18:11.723 --> 18:15.092
That was my favorite table.
Del Rio's up.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.795
But he walks right into
Cena's sidewalk slam.

18:19.764 --> 18:23.733
And the crowd goes wild.
But wait, big show's back.

18:23.735 --> 18:27.771
With a picnic table?
Where did he get a picnic table?

18:27.773 --> 18:29.606
Oh, the humanity.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.676
I don't see anything in the rules
about the use of furniture.

18:32.678 --> 18:34.711
It's a show, Velma.

18:34.713 --> 18:37.714
It's Sin Cara to the rescue
with a tilt-a-whirl.

18:37.716 --> 18:39.683
And it's a takedown
of the big show.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.151
Oh!

18:41.153 --> 18:42.185
Whoo-hoo!

18:42.187 --> 18:43.720
W!
W!

18:43.722 --> 18:45.856
Best move ever.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.157
Cena gathers his...

18:47.159 --> 18:49.226
Well, I can't say I'm bored.

18:49.228 --> 18:52.095
And here it comes.
You can't see me.

18:52.097 --> 18:55.232
Cena's vintage 5 knuckle shuffle.

18:56.268 --> 18:59.803
Let's go, Cena!
Let's go, Cena!

18:59.805 --> 19:03.507
Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Yay!

19:03.509 --> 19:08.678
With incredible strength, Cena
takes big show to the top ropes.

19:08.680 --> 19:12.115
An avalanche.
Attitude adjustment.

19:12.117 --> 19:13.250
Into the cover.

19:13.252 --> 19:15.085
1, 2, 3!

19:15.087 --> 19:16.353
It's over!

19:16.355 --> 19:18.822
Cena for the win.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.857
Cena for the win.

19:20.859 --> 19:23.727
Yeah! Yeah, man!

19:23.729 --> 19:25.862
Amazing, dude!

19:25.864 --> 19:29.232
Tonight's tag team winners,

19:29.234 --> 19:33.771
John Cena and Sin Cara.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.742
Oh, Cena! My gosh,
you're wonderful.

19:44.482 --> 19:46.416
Welcome, fans.

19:49.254 --> 19:52.589
You should be excited because
I'm about to lay on you

19:52.591 --> 19:54.691
something very heavy...

19:54.693 --> 19:59.095
our very own WWE championship belt.

20:06.504 --> 20:09.506
Ahh.

20:09.508 --> 20:11.208
Yes, it's solid gold,

20:11.210 --> 20:14.244
encrusted with priceless
gems and jewels,

20:14.246 --> 20:18.815
but any WWE superstar will tell
you it's not about the glitter.

20:18.817 --> 20:22.819
The championship belt
represents honor, respect,

20:22.821 --> 20:25.355
hard work, dedication,

20:25.357 --> 20:28.458
the very soul of WWE.

20:30.796 --> 20:35.899
As you know, ever since Kane's WWE
championship match was overturned,

20:35.901 --> 20:39.469
this championship belt
has been held vacant.

20:39.471 --> 20:43.840
And so it shall remain until
a true champion rises up

20:43.842 --> 20:45.842
and proves themself worthy

20:45.844 --> 20:50.714
this weekend in the main
event at Wrestlemania.

20:56.988 --> 20:59.456
Did you know that a
golden ceremonial prize

20:59.458 --> 21:02.592
was customary at ancient games
for thousands of years?

21:02.594 --> 21:04.661
No, Velma.
Thank you.

21:06.064 --> 21:10.767
Oh, it's a text from John Cena, thanking
me personally for all the cheering.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.102
That's a keeper.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.837
When did you give Cena
your phone number?

21:13.839 --> 21:17.707
Oh, when I gave him my email, my
home address, and my scarf size.

21:17.709 --> 21:22.445
Hey, why don't you crazy kids join
us at the training camp tonight?

21:22.447 --> 21:24.381
It's something to see.

21:24.383 --> 21:27.183
WWE training camp?

21:40.197 --> 21:42.399
How'd you like sin
Cara's convertible?

21:42.401 --> 21:46.036
Like, it's a real muscle machine.

21:55.012 --> 21:56.579
Here we are, guys.

21:56.581 --> 21:59.149
WWE's rock yard,

21:59.151 --> 22:02.285
where the pros train for greatness.

22:04.588 --> 22:06.589
Ahh!

22:15.499 --> 22:17.600
Uhh!

22:21.138 --> 22:21.971
Look!

22:21.973 --> 22:24.007
It's sergeant slaughter.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.943
Like, Zowie!
There's Jerry "The King" Lawler.

22:26.945 --> 22:29.112
And Jimmy hart.

22:30.614 --> 22:34.984
Here at camp, we even have
our own 24-hour restaurant.

22:34.986 --> 22:36.619
It's like home.

22:36.621 --> 22:39.622
More like paradise.
Ha ha ha!

22:39.624 --> 22:41.391
Is that the championship belt?

22:41.393 --> 22:44.094
That's right, carved
into the Mountain.

22:44.096 --> 22:48.698
A prize set in stone and the
dream of every superstar.

22:50.335 --> 22:53.570
Mr. Sin Cara, could
we stop for a second?

23:01.579 --> 23:03.380
Uhh!

23:04.482 --> 23:05.648
Uhh!

23:08.452 --> 23:09.786
Sweet.

23:09.788 --> 23:12.789
Way to go, Ruben.
That was a nice job.

23:12.791 --> 23:17.694
Yeah, nice move, Ruby.
Yeah, funktastic, baby.

23:18.997 --> 23:23.199
Like, wow, I didn't know your
nephew dude was a superstar.

23:23.201 --> 23:25.969
That's what he'd like to think.

23:25.971 --> 23:28.671
I'd better get you all
settled into your cabins.

23:28.673 --> 23:30.507
Up ahead on the left, Sin Cara.

23:38.516 --> 23:43.219
I can't believe Shaggy and Scooby
left all our luggage behind.

23:43.221 --> 23:45.422
Now all I have are
these two scarves.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.824
Which do you think John
would like better?

23:47.826 --> 23:49.192
Seriously?

23:49.194 --> 23:50.860
Seriously.
Be honest.

23:50.862 --> 23:53.496
The one on the right.

23:53.498 --> 23:55.398
My thoughts exactly.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.734
I don't understand, Uncle cookie.

23:57.736 --> 24:00.270
It's just not fair.

24:01.672 --> 24:04.974
You know I'm good.
I know you know I'm good.

24:04.976 --> 24:07.577
Why won't you help me get into WWE?

24:07.579 --> 24:10.613
Somebody's got to put
some sense into you.

24:10.615 --> 24:13.583
Do you think I built this brace
because it looks good?

24:13.585 --> 24:17.654
All it takes is one accident
to put you out of contention.

24:17.656 --> 24:20.657
Maybe I'll be luckier. Maybe not.

24:20.659 --> 24:22.158
You have to be practical.

24:22.160 --> 24:25.061
You should keep going to
your computer classes.

24:25.063 --> 24:29.466
Computers, that's the ticket, Ruby.

24:35.773 --> 24:37.173
Poor Ruben.

24:37.175 --> 24:40.176
I feel sorry for him.
It's understandable.

24:40.178 --> 24:44.747
Ruben represents the heroic male aspiring
to the stature of decorated warrior.

24:44.749 --> 24:48.885
His journey is relatable, and therefore
appealing to a wide audience.

24:48.887 --> 24:50.620
Velma, has it ever occurred to you

24:50.622 --> 24:54.858
that maybe WWE isn't something
you can scientifically explain?

24:54.860 --> 24:56.092
Don't be silly, Daphne.

24:56.094 --> 24:59.462
Science and logic
explain everything.

25:04.468 --> 25:07.370
Hey, like, the most
awesome thing about WWE?

25:07.372 --> 25:09.973
You get all the food you can eat.

25:09.975 --> 25:12.542
Yeah. All the food.

25:12.544 --> 25:15.245
Big day tomorrow.
Cookie said we get to see

25:15.247 --> 25:16.946
some superstars training.

25:16.948 --> 25:20.116
I want to grab some
wicked action shots.

25:21.785 --> 25:25.755
Come on, lights out, you two.
Okie doke, Fred.

25:25.757 --> 25:27.490
Sweet dreams, Scoob.

25:28.759 --> 25:31.694
You, too, "Raggy".

25:31.696 --> 25:33.463
All the food.

25:33.465 --> 25:34.697
Food.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.766
All the food.

25:38.103 --> 25:40.069
Food, food, food, food,
food, food, food, food.

25:41.473 --> 25:43.473
Food, food, food, food,
food, food, food, food.

25:47.745 --> 25:49.112
Huh?

25:51.316 --> 25:53.550
Huh?

25:58.856 --> 26:00.223
Huh?

26:09.767 --> 26:12.302
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:12.304 --> 26:18.341
let's get ready to Scooby-Doo!

26:18.343 --> 26:22.412
You want to take me on?
Bring it.

26:28.953 --> 26:30.253
Ahh!

26:36.460 --> 26:38.428
Ahh!

26:46.870 --> 26:48.972
Uhh.

27:10.928 --> 27:12.662
Oh, yeah?

27:12.664 --> 27:16.232
Prepare to become a Scooby snack.

27:22.439 --> 27:23.840
Scoob.

27:23.842 --> 27:25.642
Scooby-Doo.

27:25.644 --> 27:26.943
Hmm?

27:26.945 --> 27:30.947
Like, dude, what are you
doing with that bear?

27:30.949 --> 27:32.548
Hmm?

27:34.085 --> 27:36.185
Aah!

27:40.091 --> 27:41.257
Zoinks!

27:51.736 --> 27:54.437
Really?

27:54.439 --> 27:56.005
Aah!

27:56.007 --> 27:57.073
Uhh!

28:05.082 --> 28:06.082
Ooh!

28:06.084 --> 28:08.885
Aah!

28:09.954 --> 28:13.222
Back off, ugly.

28:19.797 --> 28:21.764
Time to call your mama.

28:21.766 --> 28:24.200
Aah! Ooh!

28:25.736 --> 28:27.570
Aah!

28:29.873 --> 28:31.107
Uhh!

28:31.109 --> 28:34.110
Not funky.

29:09.948 --> 29:12.682
Shaggy! Scooby!
Are you ok?

29:13.952 --> 29:18.921
Ghost... Ghost bear.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.523
Then it's true.

29:20.525 --> 29:23.493
What's true, cookie?
The legend.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.995
The monster has returned
from the grave.

29:25.997 --> 29:30.934
Vicious, the ghost bear has
come to challenge us all.

29:31.236 --> 29:32.802
Oh.

29:34.271 --> 29:39.008
Well, gang, sounds like we have
another mystery on our hands?

29:55.794 --> 29:59.262
Assault, battery, property damage.

29:59.264 --> 30:02.632
Ghost bear!
What the heck is going on?

30:02.634 --> 30:06.669
And what are you kids
doing in WWE City anyway?

30:06.671 --> 30:09.806
We won a contest.
We won a contest.

30:11.108 --> 30:15.111
Don't look at me, Richards.
You sent out that memo.

30:15.113 --> 30:18.047
The victory dance contest.

30:18.049 --> 30:20.883
Oh, that's right.
That wasn't my idea.

30:20.885 --> 30:23.920
Boys over in marketing
or game development.

30:23.922 --> 30:25.221
One of those.

30:25.223 --> 30:28.658
Who can keep things straight with
all these bear attacks going on?

30:28.660 --> 30:30.326
There have been others?

30:30.328 --> 30:34.363
Indeed. Several.
All of them inside our buildings.

30:34.365 --> 30:38.434
The creature trashed the kitchen and
totally obliterated our video game studio.

30:38.436 --> 30:42.371
And as quickly as it
appears, it disappears.

30:42.373 --> 30:45.107
I'm telling you, it's the ghost.

30:45.109 --> 30:47.510
An evil from beyond the grave.

30:51.282 --> 30:53.916
Let's try to remain calm here.

30:53.918 --> 30:56.552
We don't want to jump to
any crazy conclusions.

30:56.554 --> 30:58.921
Mr. McMahon.
Mr. McMahon.

30:58.923 --> 31:00.089
Like, in the flesh.

31:00.091 --> 31:03.092
I can't believe I'm actually
face to face with Vinnie Mac.

31:03.094 --> 31:05.394
The boss.
The higher power.

31:05.396 --> 31:07.430
The Mac attack.
The Mac daddy.

31:07.432 --> 31:08.965
Daddy Mac.

31:08.967 --> 31:13.102
Yes. Ahem. Thanks for that
trip down memory Lane.

31:13.104 --> 31:14.604
Let me cut to the chase.

31:14.606 --> 31:16.606
I've been doing a little
research on you kids.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.641
You're some kind of
mystery solvers.

31:18.643 --> 31:22.712
We could really use your help here.

31:22.714 --> 31:25.414
Gee, Mr. McMahon, we'd be glad to.

31:25.416 --> 31:28.317
My main concern is the
championship belt.

31:28.319 --> 31:30.052
Not only is it worth a fortune,

31:30.054 --> 31:33.389
but Wrestlemania wouldn't
be the same without it.

31:33.391 --> 31:38.427
Excuse me, sir, but we don't need these
kids meddling in security matters.

31:38.429 --> 31:42.031
I promise the championship
belt is well guarded 24/7

31:42.033 --> 31:45.501
with a state-of-the-art electronic
laser trip wire alarm system.

31:45.503 --> 31:47.036
There's no way the
bear could get to it

31:47.038 --> 31:48.938
without tripping a beam
and setting off an alarm

31:48.940 --> 31:52.208
that would bring in half my
security men within seconds.

31:52.210 --> 31:56.178
I understand, Richards, but it couldn't
hurt to have these kids lend a hand.

31:56.180 --> 31:57.947
It's what we do.

32:00.517 --> 32:05.087
You mind if I help?
Um... great idea, John.

32:05.089 --> 32:09.125
Awesome. Because I think there's
someone you should talk to.

32:24.107 --> 32:25.541
Sin Cara?

32:25.543 --> 32:28.611
He knows the legend of the
bear better than anyone.

32:28.613 --> 32:31.213
Like, why is he hanging
out on the roof?

32:31.215 --> 32:33.883
Sin Cara has a flair for drama.

32:39.356 --> 32:41.157
Ahh.
Ahh.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.528
But does he even talk?
He doesn't have to.

32:45.530 --> 32:49.165
Luckily, I speak masked luchador.

32:49.167 --> 32:51.567
I'll translate as best I can.

32:56.474 --> 32:59.275
The legend of the ghost
bear begins 100 years ago

32:59.277 --> 33:02.345
when a monstrous bear was
part of a traveling show.

33:02.347 --> 33:03.679
They named him vicious.

33:03.681 --> 33:05.081
And for good reason.

33:05.083 --> 33:08.451
The creature had a mean streak
a mile wide and twice as ugly.

33:08.453 --> 33:10.453
It'd never been beaten, ever.

33:10.455 --> 33:13.189
Till it met...

33:13.191 --> 33:15.992
Sin Cara Grande,

33:15.994 --> 33:19.395
Sin Cara's great great
great grandfather.

33:19.397 --> 33:22.465
He challenged the bear
on this very spot

33:22.467 --> 33:25.234
long before there was
ever a WWE City.

33:26.838 --> 33:30.272
The battle between man
and bear was epic.

33:33.610 --> 33:35.878
The bear was a horrible,
unstoppable beast.

33:40.283 --> 33:45.121
But when the match was over, it
was the man standing victorious.

33:50.795 --> 33:52.595
The bear could not
contain its anger.

33:58.969 --> 34:01.170
He unleashed his rage on the town.

34:02.172 --> 34:04.173
Many lives would have
been lost that day

34:04.175 --> 34:08.476
had it not been for the brave
luchador Sin Cara Grande.

34:14.351 --> 34:17.219
While saving those innocent
townfolk, he was injured.

34:20.657 --> 34:23.458
Sin Cara Grande would
never wrestle again.

34:23.460 --> 34:24.893
And the bear?

34:24.896 --> 34:28.197
It escaped into the woods, disappearing
into a cave north of town,

34:28.199 --> 34:31.766
never to be seen again.
Until now.

34:32.803 --> 34:34.904
Sin Cara believes the
spirit of the beast

34:34.906 --> 34:37.172
has been stirred by
Wrestlemania itself,

34:37.175 --> 34:41.710
which is why the monster has risen
from the grave to have its revenge.

34:43.581 --> 34:44.780
But fear not.

34:44.782 --> 34:47.116
It is now Sin Cara's honor and duty

34:47.118 --> 34:49.819
to continue his great great
great grandfather's legacy

34:49.821 --> 34:53.322
and protect WWE City at any cost.

34:54.424 --> 34:56.391
Wow.
That's amazing, dude.

35:10.140 --> 35:13.342
I have half a mind to
go out in the woods,

35:13.344 --> 35:17.079
find that bear, and
rip its head off.

35:18.316 --> 35:20.683
I don't know, Triple H,
he's awfully tough.

35:20.685 --> 35:22.585
I think we should stick together.

35:22.587 --> 35:25.688
What do you think, Miz?

35:25.690 --> 35:28.090
Stick together.

35:31.962 --> 35:35.564
I can't believe you two are still
hungry after the meal we had.

35:35.566 --> 35:37.566
This is just a late night snack.

35:37.568 --> 35:40.369
Right, Scoob?
Right. Helps us sleep.

35:40.371 --> 35:43.339
Man, if you guys' muscles were
as big as your appetites,

35:43.341 --> 35:46.342
you'd both be superstars.

35:50.647 --> 35:55.317
Like, Fredster, don't you want
to join the Pizzapalooza?

35:55.319 --> 35:56.519
Eh, no, thanks.

35:56.521 --> 35:59.755
I thought I'd patrol with the guards,
maybe get a picture of the ghost bear.

35:59.757 --> 36:02.124
I'll lock the door after me.

36:02.126 --> 36:06.428
Like, to keep the bear out?
To keep Scooby in.

36:06.430 --> 36:08.397
Good idea.

36:08.399 --> 36:12.468
Like, don't worry, Freddy, the faster
we eat... the faster we fall asleep.

37:21.204 --> 37:22.338
Ahh!

37:25.443 --> 37:27.009
Yah!

37:31.748 --> 37:34.717
Like, is something wrong,
Ms. Richards?

37:34.719 --> 37:36.719
Indeed, there is.

37:36.721 --> 37:40.756
The WWE championship
belt has been stolen.

37:43.793 --> 37:46.061
And we know who did it.

37:46.063 --> 37:50.499
Your dog.
Uh, but that's ridiculous.

37:50.501 --> 37:53.068
Scooby-Doo's been in
here with me all night.

37:53.070 --> 37:54.970
Isn't that right, old pal?

37:54.972 --> 37:56.572
That's right.

37:56.574 --> 37:58.574
Oh?

37:58.576 --> 38:00.442
I saw that.

38:00.444 --> 38:02.678
Uh-uh, nothing to see here.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.513
Just me in bed.

38:09.953 --> 38:13.689
You, sir... uh, dog, are a thief.

38:13.691 --> 38:16.558
But, Ms. Richards, Scooby
couldn't have taken the belt.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.927
He's never stolen anything
in his whole life.

38:18.929 --> 38:20.829
Yeah, never.

38:20.831 --> 38:22.865
I have proof right here.

38:22.867 --> 38:26.502
Last night's security footage.
Take a look.

38:35.879 --> 38:37.413
Ooh. Uhh.

38:55.865 --> 38:59.268
I... I... I did steal it.

38:59.270 --> 39:02.237
Say it ain't true, Scooby-Doo.

39:09.814 --> 39:11.747
Hold on a second.

39:11.749 --> 39:14.817
Is there something
strange about Scooby?

39:14.819 --> 39:18.087
You really want us to answer that?

39:24.461 --> 39:28.864
Yep, this is the
championship belt all right.

39:28.866 --> 39:31.533
I'd know it anywhere.

39:31.535 --> 39:34.136
Take it.

39:34.138 --> 39:37.306
And we'll be taking the
thief with us as well.

39:38.408 --> 39:42.478
No! Don't let them take me, "Raggy".

39:42.480 --> 39:44.113
No!

39:44.115 --> 39:46.815
I won't, pal.
Hang on.

39:46.817 --> 39:49.051
Don't let them take me, Raggy.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.152
I'm innocent.

39:50.154 --> 39:51.954
Jinkies! That's it.

39:51.956 --> 39:53.389
Come on, we've got to work fast

39:53.391 --> 39:55.324
if we're going to save Scooby.

40:05.535 --> 40:07.503
All right, kids.

40:07.505 --> 40:09.304
What's going on here?

40:09.306 --> 40:11.507
Thanks for coming, Mr. McMahon.

40:11.509 --> 40:13.308
We've asked you all
here to show you

40:13.310 --> 40:15.511
that our Scooby isn't a thief.

40:15.513 --> 40:19.081
He's just a pawn.
Allow me.

40:21.518 --> 40:25.454
Here's the security video of
Scooby as he was taking the belt.

40:25.456 --> 40:29.057
And here's the video file of Scooby
doing his winning victory dance

40:29.059 --> 40:31.393
from the memory card of
Shaggy's video game.

40:31.395 --> 40:34.963
Yeah, that's a funkadactal move.

40:34.965 --> 40:37.933
Is there a point to any of this?

40:37.935 --> 40:40.669
Watch as we slow down
the victory dance.

40:47.043 --> 40:49.178
It's the same movement.

40:49.180 --> 40:52.714
Scooby was programmed with
a post-hypnotic suggestion

40:52.716 --> 40:55.417
to steal the championship belt.

40:55.419 --> 40:58.687
Like, that's why he's been sleep
walking since he got here.

40:58.689 --> 41:02.324
Ohh. Yeah.

41:02.326 --> 41:07.196
And just how did the dog get
this post-hypnotic programming?

41:07.198 --> 41:09.698
My guess is from the
video game itself.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.200
May I?

41:13.203 --> 41:16.572
I'm connecting Shaggy's
WWE video game file

41:16.574 --> 41:19.274
to the tron screen.

41:28.751 --> 41:33.055
See, someone highlighted
every move with light flashes.

41:33.057 --> 41:35.157
Flashes which could have planted

41:35.159 --> 41:37.726
a post-hypnotic suggestion
in Scooby's brain.

41:37.728 --> 41:42.565
Yeah, there's a plant in my brain.

41:42.967 --> 41:44.900
Nice hacks, Ruben.

41:44.902 --> 41:47.002
That's my nephew.

41:47.004 --> 41:49.338
He's a computer genius.

41:51.474 --> 41:55.511
Listen, kids, as compelling
as this theory might be,

41:55.513 --> 41:57.713
I'm still a guy that likes
to look at the facts.

41:57.715 --> 41:59.982
And the fact is, he stole it.

41:59.984 --> 42:02.618
And he's going to jail for it.

42:02.620 --> 42:05.721
Jail?

42:05.723 --> 42:09.925
And it was your video game, so you're
going with him... as his accomplice.

42:09.927 --> 42:12.594
Accomplice? I'm no accomplice!

42:12.596 --> 42:14.863
I'm not even sure
I know what that means!

42:14.865 --> 42:18.367
Miss Richards, isn't there something
we can do to prevent that?

42:18.369 --> 42:21.103
No!
Actually, yes there is.

42:21.105 --> 42:24.172
Whatever it is...
We'll do it.

42:24.174 --> 42:27.843
WWE City law states that
anyone accused of a crime

42:27.845 --> 42:31.547
can compete in the ring for a
chance to win their freedom.

42:33.117 --> 42:36.051
I have the power to
give you that chance.

42:36.053 --> 42:41.590
But I have only one competitor
left who is looking for a match.

42:54.137 --> 42:56.405
Kane!
Kane!

42:56.407 --> 43:00.375
I want another shot at the title.

43:00.377 --> 43:05.147
Looks like I'll have to go
through you two to get it.

43:05.149 --> 43:08.483
I accept the challenge.

43:08.485 --> 43:13.655
Like, you know, Scoob, I hear
prison food isn't that bad.

43:13.657 --> 43:15.223
No!

43:15.225 --> 43:18.093
You want a chance to prove
your innocence in the ring.

43:18.095 --> 43:21.229
They accept the challenge,
Mr. McMahon.

43:24.801 --> 43:27.970
Miss Richards, release these
two so they can prepare.

43:27.972 --> 43:30.105
Unless they can prove
their innocence,

43:30.107 --> 43:33.041
their match with Kane will
kick off Wrestlemania

43:33.043 --> 43:36.745
tomorrow night.

43:56.432 --> 43:58.567
Like, Velma, are you crazy?!

43:58.569 --> 44:01.303
Yeah! We can't fight Kane.

44:01.305 --> 44:03.338
Look, guys,
pull yourselves together.

44:03.340 --> 44:06.775
I need you to buy us some time if
we're going to solve this mystery,

44:06.777 --> 44:08.543
and clear Scooby's name.

44:08.545 --> 44:11.246
I don't know, Velma,
we only have until tomorrow

44:11.248 --> 44:13.248
before Shaggy and
Scooby get slaughtered.

44:13.250 --> 44:15.884
Hello! Thanks, Fred.

44:15.886 --> 44:18.553
They're going to need a
whole lot longer than a day

44:18.555 --> 44:20.589
to learn how to
compete in the ring.

44:20.591 --> 44:22.991
Could you help them, cookie?
Please?

44:22.993 --> 44:25.961
Yeah, yeah, please, please, please!

44:25.963 --> 44:27.896
Oh-ho-ho, please, cookie!

44:27.898 --> 44:31.366
Eh, well, maybe I can
train 'em enough

44:31.368 --> 44:33.735
so they might survive...

44:33.737 --> 44:35.270
Ooh!

44:35.272 --> 44:37.806
For a few minutes.

44:39.309 --> 44:41.677
Aj, you want to help me here?

44:41.679 --> 44:44.680
Sure, cookie.

44:44.682 --> 44:46.515
Hi, boys.

44:46.517 --> 44:48.684
I heard you could use
some practice sessions.

44:48.686 --> 44:53.255
Wouldn't want those itty
bitty whiskers to get bent.

44:53.257 --> 44:54.723
Like, Scooby-Doo,

44:54.725 --> 44:57.959
you know, this may not
be so bad after all.

44:59.862 --> 45:01.530
Aahh!

45:01.532 --> 45:05.467
Never underestimate a diva.

46:08.831 --> 46:12.134
You ok, Ruben?
No, I'm not ok.

46:12.136 --> 46:14.636
I don't understand why my
Uncle is willing to train

46:14.638 --> 46:16.705
Shaggy and Scooby and not me.

46:16.707 --> 46:20.976
Just because he never won a
championship doesn't mean I can't.

46:23.045 --> 46:25.280
Sorry.

46:25.282 --> 46:26.882
See, it's just because all my life,

46:26.884 --> 46:29.951
I've dreamed of being
a WWE superstar.

46:29.953 --> 46:33.421
I've even come up with my own name...
The Bone Bender.

46:33.423 --> 46:35.757
I got an outfit I made out
of spandex and bones.

46:35.759 --> 46:37.859
Real bones I ordered
off the Internet.

46:37.861 --> 46:39.161
Want to see?

46:39.163 --> 46:42.664
Well, maybe later.
Daphne?

46:42.666 --> 46:46.067
You got to hide us!

46:46.069 --> 46:49.704
Aj's like Kane, with lipstick!

46:49.706 --> 46:52.374
Hey, gang, we got maps
of the whole area.

46:52.376 --> 46:56.178
And I found the perfect place to start
looking for clues about the ghost bear.

46:56.180 --> 46:59.214
Scooby, Shaggy.

46:59.216 --> 47:01.616
Where you boys hiding?

47:01.618 --> 47:06.121
Like, what are we waiting for?
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

47:16.166 --> 47:18.800
Like, wouldn't it be
better to clear our names

47:18.802 --> 47:21.736
than to go, you know, bear hunting?

47:21.738 --> 47:23.939
That's just it, Shaggy.
I can't help thinking

47:23.941 --> 47:27.742
that whoever framed Scooby is somehow
connected to the ghost bear.

47:27.744 --> 47:31.112
Keep it down.
We don't want to attract Bayard.

47:31.114 --> 47:33.815
You mean the hillbilly
with the thieving raccoon?

47:35.485 --> 47:38.553
Yeah. Their cave is
right on his property.

47:46.429 --> 47:49.731
Can't say I didn't warn 'em.

47:53.803 --> 47:55.637
Zoinks!

47:57.807 --> 48:00.375
Aroo?
Run!

48:10.119 --> 48:11.920
Run!

48:11.922 --> 48:14.623
Scoob!

48:23.099 --> 48:24.299
Aah!

48:24.301 --> 48:26.334
Whoo-hoo-hoo-ah!

48:34.377 --> 48:37.245
Oh! Ooh, hoo, whoa-ho!

48:45.554 --> 48:50.225
Aah!
Huh?!

49:07.677 --> 49:11.046
Like, that was amazing!

49:11.048 --> 49:13.248
Cen-amazing!

49:13.250 --> 49:15.483
How'd you know where we were?

49:15.485 --> 49:17.819
Daphne texted me.
Mmm.

49:17.821 --> 49:19.587
Naturally.

49:19.589 --> 49:21.022
What's going on?

49:21.024 --> 49:24.025
Hillbilly hospitality.
We should keep moving.

49:24.027 --> 49:27.462
Come on, I'll explain on the way.

49:39.075 --> 49:41.343
This is it, guys.

49:41.345 --> 49:44.245
Bear cave.

49:45.715 --> 49:48.083
Come on, follow me.

49:48.085 --> 49:50.652
Now, that's rich.

49:50.654 --> 49:53.655
Those dummies just
walked into a trap

49:53.657 --> 49:58.259
that's better than
any I could make.

50:24.021 --> 50:26.354
Bet you that was the original bear.

50:26.356 --> 50:28.490
He doesn't look so vicious now.

50:28.492 --> 50:30.992
How long do you think
he's been there?

50:30.994 --> 50:34.029
Who cares, as long
as he stays there.

50:34.031 --> 50:36.197
Yeah!

50:57.788 --> 51:01.589
Like, man, what is
this crazy place?

51:01.591 --> 51:04.859
My guess? The lair
of the ghost bear.

51:04.861 --> 51:09.965
Like, he has a lot of junk
for a ghost... or a bear.

51:10.267 --> 51:11.900
Not junk.

51:11.902 --> 51:13.468
Clues!

51:13.470 --> 51:14.669
What are those?

51:14.671 --> 51:16.271
Books on hypnotism.

51:16.273 --> 51:19.474
Hypnotic techniques and
subliminal hypnosis.

51:19.476 --> 51:22.677
Jackpot!
Ohh!

51:22.679 --> 51:24.979
I think we just found our
first piece of evidence

51:24.981 --> 51:27.916
to get you guys off
the hook with Kane.

51:27.918 --> 51:29.784
Evidence! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

51:29.786 --> 51:32.287
We love evidence.

51:32.289 --> 51:35.523
Mwah!
Hey, gang.

51:35.525 --> 51:37.292
Check this out.

51:40.262 --> 51:42.730
Schematics for EMP.

51:42.732 --> 51:45.366
What's an EMP?

51:45.368 --> 51:47.735
What's a schematic?

51:47.737 --> 51:51.106
An EMP is an electromagnetic pulse.

51:51.108 --> 51:54.109
It's a device that can destroy
electronics within its range.

51:54.111 --> 51:57.278
Urghh!

51:57.280 --> 52:00.115
Look what I found.

52:00.117 --> 52:04.319
This calendar has the date for
Wrestlemania circled in red.

52:04.321 --> 52:08.089
R.I.P. WWE.

52:08.091 --> 52:10.758
Fred!

52:10.760 --> 52:12.327
Evidence photos, Velma.

52:12.329 --> 52:15.230
Can't have an investigation
without evidence photos.

52:15.232 --> 52:20.034
So someone thinks they're going to
knock the lights out on Wrestlemania?

52:20.036 --> 52:22.370
Not on my watch!

52:26.408 --> 52:27.542
John!

52:27.544 --> 52:29.711
Gh-gh-ghost bear!

52:35.418 --> 52:37.252
Run!

52:42.225 --> 52:44.092
Yikes!

53:01.577 --> 53:03.912
Ohh!

53:03.914 --> 53:06.748
Whoa!

53:09.418 --> 53:11.052
Ohhh!

53:11.054 --> 53:14.289
Ah-ah-aaah!

54:03.539 --> 54:04.973
Huh?!

54:12.682 --> 54:14.649
We're right back where we started!

54:14.651 --> 54:16.451
Jinkies!

54:16.453 --> 54:18.653
And so's the ghost bear!

54:59.963 --> 55:03.298
Where are the boys?!

55:20.115 --> 55:22.583
We got to get the evidence!

55:22.585 --> 55:26.154
Don't worry, Shaggy.
I still have the photos.

55:26.156 --> 55:27.355
Yeah!

55:28.692 --> 55:30.725
No!

55:30.727 --> 55:33.394
Yoinks!
Ahh!

55:36.666 --> 55:40.868
Guys, hold on to something.

55:48.711 --> 55:50.411
Aah... ohh?

55:52.082 --> 55:54.415
Ohh!

55:56.519 --> 55:59.754
Ah. Huh?

56:01.891 --> 56:03.925
Boom!

56:11.034 --> 56:13.534
Epic!

56:13.536 --> 56:16.070
Ah, enough already!

56:25.948 --> 56:29.117
Hey! Over there!

56:29.119 --> 56:31.052
Huh?

56:39.895 --> 56:43.231
Hey! What do you know?

56:43.233 --> 56:48.236
The caves are connected directly to
the storm drains under WWE City.

56:48.238 --> 56:52.206
Giving that ghost bear
full access at any time.

57:01.250 --> 57:05.086
So you see, Richards,
that's how the ghost bear

57:05.088 --> 57:07.221
gets in and out of so
many places so quickly.

57:07.223 --> 57:10.591
And we have reason to believe that
whoever's behind these bear attacks,

57:10.593 --> 57:14.462
has planted an EMP device
right here in the stadium.

57:14.464 --> 57:17.799
He could shut down the whole place
right in the middle of Wrestlemania.

57:17.801 --> 57:21.836
We shouldn't take any risks.
We'll have to cancel the show.

57:21.838 --> 57:24.038
We can't cancel Wrestlemania!

57:24.040 --> 57:25.807
That's like canceling Christmas.

57:25.809 --> 57:27.575
Not to mention my career.

57:27.577 --> 57:31.045
Besides, what could anyone gain
but shutting off the lights?

57:31.047 --> 57:34.248
Not only the lights,
but the TV cameras, too.

57:34.250 --> 57:35.950
There'd be no show.

57:35.952 --> 57:37.819
People would panic
in the pitch black.

57:37.821 --> 57:40.021
They'd get hurt!

57:42.959 --> 57:45.059
You're right, Sin Cara.

57:45.061 --> 57:47.895
It would tarnish the
entire legacy of WWE.

57:47.897 --> 57:49.464
Listen. I'll have my men

57:49.466 --> 57:52.033
guard the stadium's
generators 24/7.

57:52.035 --> 57:54.902
They'll check every square inch of
the building right before the show.

57:54.904 --> 57:57.572
No one's going to get away
with anything under my watch.

57:57.574 --> 58:01.676
One way or another,
Wrestlemania goes on.

58:02.978 --> 58:05.980
If the object of the EMP
is to create chaos,

58:05.982 --> 58:09.484
you can bet that ghost bear is not
going to be far away when it happens.

58:09.486 --> 58:12.487
I think we all know
what we need to do.

58:12.489 --> 58:14.121
Run away?

58:14.123 --> 58:17.725
Nope. We've got to turn
Wrestlemania into a trap.

58:17.727 --> 58:19.527
A big bear trap.

58:19.529 --> 58:22.430
Whatever you plan,
Fred, count me in.

58:24.399 --> 58:27.702
Come on, then.
We don't have much time.

58:49.325 --> 58:51.526
Ladies and gentlemen,

58:51.528 --> 58:56.364
announcing a new match
for tonight's event.

58:56.366 --> 59:03.771
Kane vs. Skinny man and dead meat.

59:09.077 --> 59:12.413
Like, do you think maybe the
gang has solved the mystery yet?

59:12.415 --> 59:15.316
Because there's no mysteries
to where we're going.

59:15.318 --> 59:17.952
Yeah. To the hospital.

59:17.954 --> 59:19.987
No. The morgue!

59:19.989 --> 59:22.757
Come on, guys, you got
to have confidence.

59:22.759 --> 59:25.459
You have to get up there
and give it your all!

59:25.461 --> 59:28.696
If you don't hold back; If you
battle with your heart and soul,

59:28.698 --> 59:30.531
if you give everything you've got,

59:30.533 --> 59:34.669
then you'll not only survive
this, you could win!

59:51.153 --> 59:54.121
Nice knowin' ya.

59:55.691 --> 59:59.260
Hey, uh...
Break a leg, you two.

59:59.262 --> 01:00:02.496
Ooh! If we're lucky.

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:04.098
Whoo-hoo!

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:08.302
Let the games begin!
Bring on the pain train!

01:00:16.778 --> 01:00:17.945
Whoo!

01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:21.515
This is going to be great!
Yeah!

01:00:21.517 --> 01:00:24.151
So awesome!

01:00:27.956 --> 01:00:30.925
Everybody in position?

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:33.160
Check.

01:00:33.162 --> 01:00:35.229
Check.

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:37.765
Sin Cara's ready.

01:00:39.768 --> 01:00:43.571
And so am I.
Triple H?

01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:47.241
Ready out here.

01:00:57.886 --> 01:01:01.622
Welcome to Wrestlemania!

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:07.962
Allow me to show you
why we're all here...

01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:09.764
Bring it up.

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:13.868
The WWE championship belt.

01:01:22.678 --> 01:01:25.946
The superstar who wins
tonight's main event

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:30.451
will be the new WWE champion.

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:33.788
Jinkies! That's it. Fred,

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:36.924
I know where the electromagnetic
pulse device is.

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.696
Tonight's first match
is a big one, folks.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:46.267
We have the newcomers,
skinny man and dead meat.

01:01:51.239 --> 01:01:53.808
Ohh!
Ohh!

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:04.151
They'll be facing the
meanest competitor

01:02:04.153 --> 01:02:06.320
in and out of the ring.

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:10.324
Back for revenge, determined
to destroy anyone

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:13.427
between him and the title.

01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:16.731
I give you the big, red monster.

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:19.734
Kane!

01:02:31.814 --> 01:02:33.614
This is a last man standing match.

01:02:33.616 --> 01:02:35.983
The superstar who's unable
to answer a ten count

01:02:35.985 --> 01:02:40.988
after being knocked down
is declared the loser.

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:47.261
Come on, Scoob, we got...

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:49.730
we got to keep it together!

01:02:49.732 --> 01:02:51.932
Oh... oh... k!

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:59.039
After Kane is finished with
skinny man and dead meat,

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:03.344
we'll be scraping them off
the mat with a spatula.

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:09.517
And there's the bell.

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:11.919
Kane explodes across the ring.

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:15.990
Oh! There goes any
chance for a fair match.

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:20.227
Skinny man and dead meat...

01:03:20.229 --> 01:03:23.164
slam into the big red monster.

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:28.603
Certainly that blow can
only increase Kane's fury.

01:03:28.905 --> 01:03:30.571
Ohh!

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:36.343
Miss Richards, you have to open the
safe and check the championship belt!

01:03:36.345 --> 01:03:41.248
Are you crazy? Look, I checked the entire
stadium for your electro-whatumacalit.

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:44.251
It's not here!
It's right there.

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:46.120
Impossible.

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:49.824
If only I had a magnet to prove it.

01:03:55.731 --> 01:03:57.765
Wow! Where did you get that?

01:03:57.767 --> 01:04:00.267
Luchadores... always
ready for anything.

01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:03.838
Ok. Miss Richards,
this magnet will prove

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.407
that your championship
belt isn't gold.

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:09.376
Because if it sticks...

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:12.913
Then it's made of
iron and it's a fake.

01:04:15.183 --> 01:04:19.086
Caught in the clenches of Kane,
the newcomers are done for.

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:20.821
Whoa!

01:04:20.823 --> 01:04:23.224
The bounce out of the ring
offers skinny man and dead meat

01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:25.893
a chance for escape...
but look at this!

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:28.395
Kane has just taken the
match under the ring.

01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:30.698
It's bedlam down below!

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:38.105
Huh?!
Ahh!

01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:42.843
Not again!

01:04:42.845 --> 01:04:45.746
Somebody get me another
desk out here, please.

01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:47.448
Ha ha!

01:04:57.792 --> 01:05:00.794
Jinkies! The EMP is
about to go off.

01:05:00.796 --> 01:05:02.663
We'll never get it far enough away.

01:05:02.665 --> 01:05:05.499
The arena power generator
is right below us.

01:05:10.305 --> 01:05:13.474
I've got to warn everyone.

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:16.410
I have an idea.

01:05:19.448 --> 01:05:22.850
Hold this and let go when I say.

01:05:22.852 --> 01:05:26.120
Right... Ok.

01:05:37.332 --> 01:05:39.166
Now!

01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:40.634
Eeh!

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:45.940
That wasn't supposed to happen.

01:05:55.050 --> 01:05:58.018
Huh? Whoa!

01:06:08.763 --> 01:06:11.332
Huh? What's going on?
What happened?

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:13.867
What happened to the TV?!

01:06:13.869 --> 01:06:16.837
Oh, man, this is awful!

01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:19.506
Who turned out the lights?

01:06:33.555 --> 01:06:36.457
Ok, guys, it's here.

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:41.595
The fans are starting to panic.

01:06:41.597 --> 01:06:44.865
Plan B. Here we go.

01:07:18.166 --> 01:07:20.367
Whoo-hoo! Nice throw!

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:24.004
We can see!
Let there be light!

01:07:24.006 --> 01:07:26.473
Funkadelic.

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:28.142
Part of the show?

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:30.677
That was just part of the show!
I was worried.

01:07:30.679 --> 01:07:33.614
I'm fine now.
I'm ok!

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:36.683
Scooby! You can do it.

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:38.519
You know all the right moves.

01:07:38.521 --> 01:07:40.154
I do?
Yeah!

01:07:40.156 --> 01:07:42.923
From the video game.
I trust the massive power

01:07:42.925 --> 01:07:45.692
of your superstar-tastic
dance moves.

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:49.263
Just pretend you're playing
the video game.

01:07:53.268 --> 01:07:55.636
I can do this.

01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:57.371
I can do this!

01:08:10.318 --> 01:08:13.220
That a boy, Scoob!

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:15.089
Huh?!

01:08:55.729 --> 01:08:58.599
Ghost bear sighted.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.901
Good. He's here.

01:09:00.903 --> 01:09:04.805
Just like we thought he'd be.
The lights are starting to go.

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:07.241
Don't worry... Fred's on it.

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:09.076
Triple H.

01:09:11.546 --> 01:09:14.113
Ok, guys,

01:09:14.116 --> 01:09:16.383
hit the generators.

01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:48.381
Huh?

01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:53.520
After a mysterious blackout,
we're somehow back on the air.

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:56.356
Hey! Dead meat's not dead yet.

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:58.692
Wow, look at that doggy move.

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:00.527
Go, dead meat!

01:10:08.536 --> 01:10:10.404
Freddy, go!

01:10:10.406 --> 01:10:12.306
Plan C.

01:10:24.319 --> 01:10:25.919
Hey, smokey!

01:10:25.921 --> 01:10:28.255
Where's the fire?

01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:32.492
Prepare to face the wrath
of the bone bender!

01:10:50.345 --> 01:10:52.746
Is that a bear?!

01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:55.249
Like, zoinks!

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:57.751
Is that Ruben?

01:11:04.092 --> 01:11:06.260
Ruben, no!

01:11:09.865 --> 01:11:12.733
Whoa-oh-oh!

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:14.401
Ohhh!

01:11:17.939 --> 01:11:19.640
I don't believe it, folks.

01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:23.977
Kane has been flattened, and a new
competitor has entered the ring.

01:11:23.979 --> 01:11:28.382
But wait! Someone has
activated the cage.

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:31.485
Sin Cara and John Cena
are leaping into the ring.

01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:34.554
It's a cage match!

01:11:41.429 --> 01:11:43.230
Like, we're all doomed!

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:46.900
Don't worry, Shaggy.
I'll protect you.

01:11:46.902 --> 01:11:50.537
The mysterious new competitor

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:53.440
attacks the bear from behind,
creating a distraction

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:56.109
for Cena to make a move.

01:11:56.111 --> 01:11:59.079
But this powerful creature
turns the tables on them both.

01:11:59.081 --> 01:12:03.517
Now Sin Cara stands alone.

01:12:05.953 --> 01:12:08.322
The fearless luchador attacks.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:11.291
He glides around the
bear like lightning.

01:12:17.165 --> 01:12:19.633
The bear can't even touch Sin Cara.

01:12:19.635 --> 01:12:23.603
Ladies and gentlemen, I haven't seen
moves like this in the ring before.

01:12:25.373 --> 01:12:28.709
Sin Cara delivers a
stunning blow to the bear

01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:31.578
while John Cena
recovers on the mat.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:35.449
He's going after the bear.
Cena is lifting the bear

01:12:35.451 --> 01:12:37.451
over his head.

01:12:41.422 --> 01:12:43.890
And the bear is down.

01:12:46.328 --> 01:12:47.861
Yeah!
Yay!

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:50.030
Yes!

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:53.567
What's that, bear, what's that?

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:56.203
You can't see me!

01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:01.375
Ladies and gentlemen, here it is.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:05.479
Cena's vintage five
knuckle shuffle.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:14.921
It's lights out for
this big, bad bear.

01:13:14.923 --> 01:13:16.923
This match is over.

01:13:16.925 --> 01:13:19.259
Yay! Yay!

01:13:23.865 --> 01:13:28.535
Cena and Sin Cara going
for a tandem pin.

01:13:31.607 --> 01:13:33.473
Impossible!

01:13:33.475 --> 01:13:35.675
Huh?

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:47.521
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:51.024
Scooby-Doo, where are you?!

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:53.393
This looks bad for skinny man.

01:13:53.395 --> 01:13:56.463
But wait, what is dead meat up to?

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:04.905
Dead meat has revived Kane.

01:14:04.907 --> 01:14:08.975
The big, red monster has risen.

01:14:18.653 --> 01:14:21.855
Never before have we seen
a stand-off like this.

01:14:21.857 --> 01:14:25.392
It's monster vs. Monster inside
the cage at Wrestlemania.

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:27.627
Who will survive this
supernatural match-up?

01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:32.365
Who will be victorious in
this paranormal pandemonium?

01:14:37.371 --> 01:14:40.707
Kane drives the bear back
with a stunning blow.

01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:43.276
The bear hits the mat.
Kane pins down its leg.

01:14:43.278 --> 01:14:46.246
A new competitor,
John Cena and Sin Cara

01:14:46.248 --> 01:14:50.350
pile onto the powerful creature,
but they can barely hold it down.

01:14:51.687 --> 01:14:54.554
Scooby-Doo, it's up to you!

01:14:54.556 --> 01:14:57.357
Only dead meat can
tip the balance now.

01:14:59.027 --> 01:15:01.695
Can he do it?

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:03.864
Can dead meat save the day?

01:15:03.866 --> 01:15:15.075
Scooby Doobie Doo!

01:15:18.713 --> 01:15:22.249
Dead meat just delivered a
gut-wrenching belly bomb

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:25.252
and flattened the ring
and exploded the cage!

01:15:25.254 --> 01:15:27.654
The dust is clearing now.

01:15:30.258 --> 01:15:32.526
The bear is out cold.

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:34.728
Dead meat wins it!

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.366
Whoo!

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:40.834
Dead meat!

01:15:40.836 --> 01:15:43.036
That bear is toast!

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:57.784
You ok, Velm?

01:15:57.786 --> 01:16:01.454
This... Is... Awesome!

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:05.358
Whoo-hoo!

01:16:19.307 --> 01:16:23.109
Now let's see who this
ghost bear really is.

01:16:26.714 --> 01:16:29.416
Cookie?!
Cookie?!

01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:32.552
Cookie?!
Uncle cookie!

01:16:32.554 --> 01:16:34.020
Why?

01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:36.222
WWE is your life.

01:16:36.224 --> 01:16:38.291
WWE was his life,

01:16:38.293 --> 01:16:40.760
but sadly, your Uncle cookie
never got the glory...

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:42.996
And his injury put him
out of the spotlight.

01:16:42.998 --> 01:16:44.531
Permanently.

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:46.766
He started to truly resent WWE

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:50.804
because he knew he could never be the
champion he always dreamed of being.

01:16:50.806 --> 01:16:53.607
That resentment grew into
hatred over the years,

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:56.309
as he trained others to
be what he could not.

01:16:56.311 --> 01:17:00.180
That's when he developed
his plan for revenge.

01:17:00.182 --> 01:17:01.881
But that wouldn't be enough.

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:05.151
He needed a pawn to steal
the championship belt.

01:17:05.153 --> 01:17:09.389
That's when he devised the idea
of hacking into a video game

01:17:09.391 --> 01:17:12.559
and placing post-hypnotic
suggestions into it.

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:14.494
That game would become
part of a contest,

01:17:14.496 --> 01:17:18.798
which cookie set up with fake
emails he sent throughout WWE.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.736
That's why he used the bear to
attack your video game studio.

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:24.638
To cover his tracks.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.240
The contest assured that
only the most skilled pawn

01:17:27.242 --> 01:17:30.176
would arrive at WWE City
to aid in the theft.

01:17:30.178 --> 01:17:35.215
Cookie then used flashing lights to activate
Scooby's post-hypnotic programming.

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:39.252
When cookie identified the belt in
Scooby's bed as the championship belt,

01:17:39.254 --> 01:17:42.088
he was lying.
He'd already switched them.

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:47.027
With Scooby taking the blame, cookie was
free to carry out his ultimate plan.

01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:49.696
Which was to turn out the lights,
and with the help of the bear,

01:17:49.698 --> 01:17:52.766
create so much panic and injury...

01:17:54.302 --> 01:17:59.005
That Wrestlemania would be completely
ruined and WWE would never recover.

01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:02.108
But thanks to Fred here, we got
the lights back on pretty quick.

01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:03.643
Good work!

01:18:03.645 --> 01:18:06.312
Ah, um, thanks.

01:18:08.849 --> 01:18:12.552
And the real championship
belt, where is it now?

01:18:12.554 --> 01:18:15.188
Elementary, my dear Mr. McMahon.

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:16.890
Cookie's wearing it.

01:18:22.897 --> 01:18:24.831
Sorry, cookie.

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:28.368
But the championship belt isn't
for cheaters, it's for champions.

01:18:36.744 --> 01:18:39.412
Good call, hiring these kids, sir.

01:18:39.414 --> 01:18:41.147
I thought they might come in handy.

01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:42.649
Just get cookie out of here!

01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:45.952
Yes, sir, will do, sir, you bet.

01:18:52.626 --> 01:18:56.629
A championship belt was the
icing on the cake, Mr. McMahon.

01:18:56.631 --> 01:18:59.933
Cookie could live off its golden
jewels for the rest of his life.

01:18:59.935 --> 01:19:01.201
Boo!

01:19:01.203 --> 01:19:03.636
And I would have gotten
away with it, too,

01:19:03.638 --> 01:19:06.206
if it weren't for you meddling kids

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:08.742
and your giant, crazy dog!

01:19:12.313 --> 01:19:15.515
I guess after what my Uncle's done,

01:19:15.517 --> 01:19:17.817
you won't be wanting
me around anymore.

01:19:17.819 --> 01:19:20.820
Not so, Ruby.
You're one of us now.

01:19:20.822 --> 01:19:22.522
You got the funk, son!

01:19:22.524 --> 01:19:26.092
That's right, Ruben. You've shown
a superstar spirit in the ring,

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:28.128
and at the computer.

01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:31.131
You've earned a place with us
in whatever you want to do.

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:33.800
The choice is yours.

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:36.803
Thanks, Mr. McMahon.

01:19:41.342 --> 01:19:44.811
Now that we have the
real championship belt,

01:19:44.813 --> 01:19:47.847
it needs to be awarded
to true champions.

01:19:47.849 --> 01:19:51.117
And after what I've seen
tonight, they're right here.

01:19:51.119 --> 01:19:54.287
Skinny man and dead meat!

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:18.178
Really?
Huh?

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:21.514
Well done.

01:20:26.654 --> 01:20:29.989
Scooby-Doo!

01:20:29.991 --> 01:20:32.592
Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo!

01:20:32.594 --> 01:20:35.461
Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo!

01:20:35.463 --> 01:20:38.097
Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo!

01:20:38.099 --> 01:20:41.367
Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo!

01:20:41.369 --> 01:20:44.871
Scooby-Doo!
Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo!

01:20:44.873 --> 01:20:48.107
Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo!

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:50.810
Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo!

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:55.148
Scooby Doobie doo!
