WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:04.072
Yes. Perfect!
Excellent!

00:04.105 --> 00:06.740
Well, that puzzle
only took four hours.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.642
Maybe now they'll
finally go home.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.478
Okay, who wants
to watch a movie?

00:10.511 --> 00:11.545
Me, movie!

00:11.579 --> 00:12.846
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.915
Hope, you gotta
go to bed, honey,

00:14.948 --> 00:16.016
'cause you got school tomorrow.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.151
Come on, please.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.519
Come on, please.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.154
I got Lord of the Rings:
Return of the King

00:20.188 --> 00:21.489
"Limited Edition."

00:21.522 --> 00:23.424
Don't you have to
go home for Maw Maw?

00:23.457 --> 00:25.359
Oh, we didn't tell you.
Mm.

00:25.393 --> 00:26.360
She's with the Dead now.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.328
What?!

00:27.361 --> 00:29.530
*

00:30.364 --> 00:31.665
Later on, suckers.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.535
I'm going on a long,
strange trip

00:34.568 --> 00:36.036
with Syrup Sam.

00:37.805 --> 00:41.075
I'll be back when I'm
either grateful or dead.

00:41.109 --> 00:42.676
Okay, you guys do realize

00:42.710 --> 00:44.044
that the Grateful Dead
broke up, right?

00:44.078 --> 00:45.613
Yeah, but she doesn't
know that. (laughs)

00:45.646 --> 00:46.947
Come on, this will be great.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.682
I heard this version
has an extra 20 minutes

00:48.716 --> 00:50.351
of just watching
Hobbits sleep.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.220
Um...
Mm.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.787
Uh... actually,

00:53.821 --> 00:56.023
if you guys don't mind, uh...

00:56.056 --> 00:57.891
we have to get up early.
What for?

00:57.925 --> 00:58.926
Spin class.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.394
Uh... yeah!

01:00.428 --> 01:01.695
We've gotten pretty good at it.

01:01.729 --> 01:04.465
Well, that is good.
Can you go faster?

01:06.134 --> 01:08.302
(screams)

01:09.670 --> 01:11.905
(laughs)

01:12.973 --> 01:14.908
* Whoo

01:14.942 --> 01:19.580
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

01:21.515 --> 01:22.716
What the hell, guys?

01:22.750 --> 01:23.717
What? We took up
finger painting.

01:23.751 --> 01:24.718
What's wrong with that?

01:24.752 --> 01:25.986
Yeah, we don't judge you

01:26.019 --> 01:27.321
for wearing the same
stupid four shirts.

01:27.355 --> 01:28.889
Yeah, we get it,

01:28.922 --> 01:29.790
you like pancakes.

01:29.823 --> 01:30.791
Guys, we just got

01:30.824 --> 01:32.160
Hope's report card,

01:32.193 --> 01:34.428
and it says she's been
absent 18 times.

01:34.462 --> 01:36.264
None of which
were excused by us.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.899
Do you know
anything about this?

01:38.932 --> 01:41.235
No! We stopped caring
about report cards

01:41.269 --> 01:43.137
when you were in
the first grade.
Both times.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.572
The school said that
you guys have been

01:44.605 --> 01:45.906
picking her up in
the middle of the day

01:45.939 --> 01:47.308
and bringing her back
before it ends.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.009
Guys, we know you love Hope

01:49.042 --> 01:51.645
and we know you want to
spend time with her, but...

01:51.679 --> 01:52.980
she's gotta be in school.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.248
Well, forgive us
for trying to be

01:54.282 --> 01:55.849
caring and involved
grandparents.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.451
(sneezing)

01:59.653 --> 02:01.455
Why is the hot tub sneezing?

02:01.489 --> 02:02.623
What?

02:04.825 --> 02:07.495
(Sabrina sighs)

02:07.528 --> 02:08.696
Serioursly, guys?

02:08.729 --> 02:10.198
We miss her. She's fun.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.699
BURT:
We're like the Three Amigos.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.133
She's Martin Short.

02:13.167 --> 02:15.869
Guys, I think you may have
empty-nest syndrome.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.271
Does that syndrome
give you headaches,

02:17.305 --> 02:18.839
or is that just 'cause
you guys are here?

02:18.872 --> 02:20.874
No. It just means that
you're having some trouble

02:20.908 --> 02:22.843
adjusting to your family
not living at home.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.278
Ever since you and Hope left,

02:24.312 --> 02:26.013
we do have a lot of time
on our hands.

02:26.046 --> 02:27.448
What are we supposed to do?

02:27.481 --> 02:29.016
We can only have so much sex.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.718
We certainly don't want
to work any more hours.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.720
Um... then find ways
to spend your time.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.188
Hey, you could try
volunteer work.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.723
Please, we're not rich.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.958
We don't have the luxury of
working for free, Sabrina.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.528
Then get a dog
and leave Hope out of it.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.662
(under breath):
All right.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.636
I just don't see why it
has to be a dog, Virginia.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.538
Dogs are the natural enemies
of gardeners.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.206
Burt, we need this.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.674
Sabrina was right...

02:53.707 --> 02:55.476
we have empty-nest syndrome.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.144
So we either put
a dog in our house,

02:57.177 --> 02:59.380
or you uncork your vasectomy
and put a baby in here.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.914
And I'm warning you, Burt,

03:00.948 --> 03:02.316
this ass is not
gonna bounce back

03:02.350 --> 03:03.751
after baby number two
at my age.

03:03.784 --> 03:06.354
Welcome to the
Natesville Animal Shelter.

03:06.387 --> 03:09.022
(sighs)
How can I help you?

03:09.056 --> 03:10.724
We'd like to rescue a dog.

03:10.758 --> 03:13.594
Aw... well, you don't rescue
them as much as they rescue you.

03:13.627 --> 03:14.995
Now who's gonna be
the dog's master?

03:15.028 --> 03:15.996
We both will.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.698
No! Not on my watch.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.066
A dog can only have one alpha.

03:19.099 --> 03:22.836
Well, uh...
I guess that's me.
Yeah.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.071
Uh... I'll be right back.

03:24.104 --> 03:25.639
I saw an old friend
on the way in.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.141
(gasps)

03:29.877 --> 03:31.745
(dogs barking)

03:31.779 --> 03:32.880
(whines)

03:32.913 --> 03:33.947
Hello, Bartlett.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.583
Guess you won't be digging up

03:35.616 --> 03:37.217
my freshly planted succulents
from in there, will you?

03:37.251 --> 03:38.619
(whines)

03:38.652 --> 03:40.053
I wouldn't want to be
a pretty dog like you

03:40.087 --> 03:41.054
in a place like this.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.790
(whining)

03:42.823 --> 03:45.893
I can't tell you how excited
I am to finally have a dog.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.127
I've wanted one forever.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.562
Well, they're
a lot of responsibility.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.432
I started raising a baby
in 11th grade, so,

03:51.465 --> 03:53.801
if that doesn't say responsible,
I don't know what does.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.769
So, are there any other
pets in the house?

03:55.803 --> 03:57.905
Well, there's something
living in our chimney,

03:57.938 --> 03:59.907
but we haven't had
a mouse in two years,

03:59.940 --> 04:01.041
so we don't ask questions.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.443
(beeping)

04:02.476 --> 04:03.544
Says here,
you're not allowed to adopt.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.878
Your last name
and address

04:04.912 --> 04:06.480
triggered an alert.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.115
You're on a no-dog list.

04:08.148 --> 04:11.319
What?! I told you,
we're incredibly responsible.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.886
Our granddaughter's
gonna be very upset

04:12.920 --> 04:14.555
if we come back to the car
without a dog.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.689
Yeah.

04:20.328 --> 04:23.096
Okay, Hope,
what animal is this?

04:25.333 --> 04:26.967
Butter...

04:27.000 --> 04:28.168
Cat.

04:28.201 --> 04:30.938
Jimmy... she knew
this a year ago.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.606
(door opens)

04:32.640 --> 04:34.107
Jimmy,

04:34.141 --> 04:35.309
we have a problem.

04:36.944 --> 04:41.982
Apparently, our last name and
address got on a no-dog list.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.250
Do you know anything about that?

04:43.283 --> 04:45.919
I may have had something
to do with that.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.621
Would you care
to explain that...

04:47.655 --> 04:50.090
in a way that we could visualize
it as if we were there?

04:50.123 --> 04:52.360
JIMMY:
Seven years ago
I wasn't the confident,

04:52.393 --> 04:53.961
sexy ladies' man I am today.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.630
I figured a four-legged
wingman would help

04:56.664 --> 04:59.032
and I thought if one dog
got me attention,

04:59.066 --> 05:01.001
then two dogs might
get me a little more.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.036
And I was right.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.939
Then I figured, if two dogs
got me tonsil hockey,

05:05.973 --> 05:08.709
maybe five dogs
would get me to fifth base.

05:14.214 --> 05:17.351
And my plan worked perfectly.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.553
Until the dogs decided that
they had better things to do

05:19.587 --> 05:23.290
than wait around
while I got some.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.292
(dogs barking)

05:25.325 --> 05:27.695
(laughing):
I can't believe you
used to use stray dogs

05:27.728 --> 05:29.463
to hook up with girls.

05:29.497 --> 05:32.500
Uh... excuse me. High school
dropout working with his dad,

05:32.533 --> 05:33.801
living with his parents.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.003
My toolbox wasn't exactly
overflowing.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.739
Well, thanks to you,
now we can't adopt a dog.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.574
Which I didn't want in the
first place, but your mom did...

05:40.608 --> 05:42.242
and now we're
very disappointed.

05:42.275 --> 05:43.711
This is horrible. I can't
believe you did this to us.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.713
Every week
I find out

05:45.746 --> 05:48.916
about some terrible thing
that you did to me as a kid!

05:48.949 --> 05:51.985
(sighs)
Oh, when are you gonna
stop living in the past?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.253
You gave me up for adoption.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.856
You, you faked
my childhood vacations.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.425
You ruined my credit!

05:57.458 --> 05:59.359
Okay, okay, fine.

05:59.393 --> 06:02.295
Now we can't adopt a dog,
so I guess that makes us even.

06:03.464 --> 06:06.600
Ah, Regina! Nice haircut.
Hi. Thanks.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.035
I'll have the usual.
Okay.

06:10.270 --> 06:11.405
A hot dog...

06:12.706 --> 06:14.508
and I bet somebody
wants a grape soda.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.243
Wow...

06:16.276 --> 06:17.545
Soda's on me.

06:17.578 --> 06:18.846
Thanks.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.247
Have a grape day.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.249
(laughing):
Okay.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.318
Bye-bye, cutie.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.859
There you go.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.361
Sabrina, you can't
leave me alone for a second.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.096
God, did you eat
found gum again?

06:36.129 --> 06:37.598
No, but good guess.

06:37.631 --> 06:39.199
I just got hit on big-time
by the wiener chick.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.602
My charm and good looks
just got us a free soda.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.370
I'm pretty sure
that soda was for Hope.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.539
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it was for me.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.040
Oh, my God.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.677
I just realized,
Hope is your new dog.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.583
Hello?

06:55.616 --> 06:58.251
Excuse me, we figured out
why our house was on

06:58.285 --> 06:59.820
the no-dog list.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.121
It's out idiot son.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.890
But he doesn't live
with us anymore.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.825
And if you're worried about
the "idiot" part, don't.

07:04.858 --> 07:07.127
We barely raised him.
But rules are rules.

07:07.160 --> 07:12.332
Would a person who would harm
an animal make you these?

07:12.365 --> 07:15.569
These cookies are shaped
like things humans like.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.505
Boobs, cars, televisions.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.474
And these are shaped
like things dogs like.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.576
Bones, hydrants, mailman's ass.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.311
I realize they all kind of
look like lumps,

07:24.344 --> 07:26.279
but, we're not
cookie-cutter rich. (laughs)

07:26.313 --> 07:28.682
Wow, that took a lot of effort.
Maybe I misread you.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.250
Unlike dogs,
I can't lick your hand

07:30.283 --> 07:31.318
and know what's in your heart.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.853
So you'll let us adopt a dog.

07:32.886 --> 07:35.489
Not yet. In order to
get you off the no-dog list,

07:35.523 --> 07:37.157
I have to put you through
a three-day trial period,

07:37.190 --> 07:38.492
but then...

07:38.526 --> 07:39.960
you'll be dog owners.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.695
We're so gonna kill it.

07:41.729 --> 07:44.297
Not the dog,
we're gonna love it to death.

07:44.331 --> 07:45.966
(laughing):
Oh, yeah.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.702
Okay.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.938
So... here's
what I think,

07:50.971 --> 07:54.007
if it's a girl, we should
name it Puppy Dogstocking.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.543
A boy, Spot.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.511
Remember how long
it took us to name Jimmy?

07:57.545 --> 07:58.879
If we'd gone with
our first instincts there,

07:58.912 --> 08:01.148
his name would be
Parachute Pants Chance.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.616
There are things in this house

08:02.650 --> 08:03.851
we've been trying to kill
for 20 years.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.285
I'm sure we can keep
a dog alive

08:05.318 --> 08:06.820
for three days.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.455
(doorbell rings)
Ooh, he's here.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.890
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.961
Hey, Michael.
We're so excited

08:13.994 --> 08:15.896
to meet our new little friend.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.665
I'm gonna take this little guy
out of his crate.

08:17.698 --> 08:18.832
He's a little skittish.

08:18.866 --> 08:21.168
Come on. Hi.

08:21.201 --> 08:24.037
Say hello.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.339
Huh.
This is a trial dog.

08:26.373 --> 08:27.875
It'd be crazy
to give you guys a real dog

08:27.908 --> 08:29.009
until you prove yourselves.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.411
Oh, uh, that makes sense. Yeah.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.046
So you're gonna live
with us for three days?

08:33.080 --> 08:34.347
No, he is.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.316
Just pretend I'm not here.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.652
(high-pitched voice):
Ruff. Ruff. Ruff-ruff.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.353
Ruff-ruff.

08:40.387 --> 08:42.089
Now, you're probably gonna
want to tell him to be quiet.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.157
Ruff.
Okay, quiet down, boy.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.259
Good. Good. Caring but firm.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.028
Now, what are we gonna
name this little angel?

08:48.061 --> 08:50.197
Puppet?
Come on, Burt.
That's too on the nose.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.165
Nose.
Um. No, Burt.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.167
How 'bout, um,
Puppy Dogstocking?

08:54.201 --> 08:55.603
No... he's never
going to be able

08:55.636 --> 08:57.170
to respond to commands
with a name that long.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.239
Ah, man...
we're doing bad already.

08:59.272 --> 09:02.009
Couch? Lamp? Snowboard?

09:02.042 --> 09:03.744
Burt, stop just naming things
around the house.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.545
Angry Wife?
No, come on, you guys.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.547
Don't fight. He's going to
pick up on your negative energy.

09:07.581 --> 09:11.251
Why don't we name
this little guy Jake?

09:11.284 --> 09:13.587
Jake! That's perfect,
he looks like a Jake.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.222
Yeah, he looks like
a cute little Jake.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.523
This is gonna be fun.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.426
(gasps)
Wait, are those doggy treats?

09:19.459 --> 09:21.394
Num, num, num, num,
num, num, num, num.
Oh.

09:21.428 --> 09:23.063
Now, you don't want to
let him eat the whole bag,

09:23.096 --> 09:24.632
otherwise he's gonna have
diarrhea in the house.

09:24.665 --> 09:25.899
We got a lot of work to do.

09:25.933 --> 09:26.800
Ruff.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.001
Yeah.
Ruff.
Ooh!

09:32.439 --> 09:33.607
I don't know
if I want to do this

09:33.641 --> 09:35.108
whole crazy puppet dog trial.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.209
That guy seems nuts.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.778
It's only for three days.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.479
It's not gonna be that bad.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.715
And besides, Burt, if we don't
fill the void in our lives

09:41.749 --> 09:44.117
with a dog, we are gonna keep
taking Hope out of school.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.285
And then she's just gonna

09:45.318 --> 09:46.787
grow up to be an idiot.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.488
She'll be Jimmy with boobs.

09:48.521 --> 09:49.990
(laughs)

09:50.023 --> 09:51.558
I just pictured
Jimmy with boobs.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.261
Hey, guys. You put
Jake outside a while ago.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.630
If you keep him out too long,
he's gonna get depressed.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.432
Fine, I'll do it.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.771
(sighs)
(yelps, laughs)

10:03.804 --> 10:05.673
Ah, Now that he's back with
his owners, he's very excited.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.675
(yelps)
Okay. Now, tell him down.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.409
Tell him down, because otherwise
he's gonna do this

10:09.442 --> 10:12.179
to his guests. And remember,
jumping leads to humping.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.947
Down, Jake!
Down, boy!

10:13.981 --> 10:15.115
(panting)

10:18.051 --> 10:20.153
Ooh... he just marked you as
his owner. That's a good thing.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.621
It means you're
important to him.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.490
Is that real pee?
If it was, would I do this?

10:25.325 --> 10:26.960
Maybe...

10:26.994 --> 10:28.461
(sighs)
Jimmy...

10:28.495 --> 10:30.163
I thought we were
gonna have adult time.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.464
I can't believe
we got a babysitter

10:31.498 --> 10:33.200
to just, like, come to the park.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.969
I think you're gonna be pretty
impressed with what you see.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.872
Me in action without a prop.

10:38.906 --> 10:40.974
All right. I'll just
try not to be too jealous.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.943
(exhales)

10:42.976 --> 10:44.678
Regina?
Hey.

10:44.712 --> 10:45.846
Grape to see you.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.515
(laughs)
I'll have the "usual."

10:48.548 --> 10:50.818
One hot dog, coming up.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.553
There you are.

10:53.586 --> 10:54.788
Thank you.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.990
Yeah.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.728
Sure is hot out today.

11:00.761 --> 11:04.297
Could use... something
to wash this dog down.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.499
Oh, of course.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.670
Thanks so much.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.672
Uh, that'll be a dollar.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.059
Woof. (whines)

11:32.092 --> 11:34.061
(panting)

11:34.094 --> 11:35.562
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.497
I think the dog wants
some of what you're eating.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.732
(panting)
Oh.

11:38.766 --> 11:39.933
Sorry.
Yeah.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.168
Here you go.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.535
(chewing)

11:42.569 --> 11:45.873
(gags)

11:45.906 --> 11:47.540
(guttural growl)

11:49.576 --> 11:51.745
(wheeze)

11:51.779 --> 11:54.347
Congratulations,
you just killed Jake.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.716
Don't you know how dangerous
grapes are for dogs?

11:56.750 --> 11:58.919
What? How can grapes
be bad for dogs?

11:58.952 --> 12:01.688
They're... they're colorful like
onions and sweet like chocolate.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.090
All things that can kill a dog.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.557
Oh, my God, Burt.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.593
If that had been a real dog,
we'd have killed it.

12:06.626 --> 12:08.762
I don't want
to kill a dog.
(sighs)

12:08.796 --> 12:10.197
Maybe this training
isn't so stupid.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.265
Please gi-give us
another chance.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.768
No, I'm not sticking my
hand in a dead puppet.
What are you, crazy?

12:14.802 --> 12:17.270
Jake's gone, all right? We
just have to deal with it.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.106
Way to go, Burt.
You feel good about yourself?

12:19.139 --> 12:21.208
Please, this is my fault.
I didn't take the training

12:21.241 --> 12:23.310
seriously enough, but Virginia's
right, we need a dog.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.945
There's got to be
something else we can do.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.247
All right, there's
one more thing I could do.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.352
I'm going full retriever.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.755
Go ahead,
go ahead, go ahead.

12:35.789 --> 12:36.623
Go get it.
Go get it.

12:36.656 --> 12:40.060
Oh, good catch, boy.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.294
(chuckles)

12:41.328 --> 12:43.563
Okay, drop it. Drop it.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.233
Drop it.
Say it with authority.
You got to show me who's boss.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.567
(growls): Michael, drop it.
Aah!

12:47.600 --> 12:50.070
Look at that.
I asserted control.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.905
Yeah. And it was sexy.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.073
I like Alpha Burt.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.275
Me, too.
(deeper): Me, too.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.246
Oh!
(whoops)

12:59.279 --> 13:00.480
That was amazing.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.082
You're a natural born
dog trainer.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.451
I know. And if Air Bud
taught us anything,

13:04.484 --> 13:06.286
he can learn
soccer, volleyball,

13:06.319 --> 13:07.955
and how to foil a jewel heist.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.789
This is way more fun
than playing with Hope.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.127
Oh!
Oh.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.431
Okay, y-you can't let me
pull that hard, okay?

13:18.465 --> 13:20.367
I could injure my throat.
Now, shorten the leash

13:20.400 --> 13:21.468
and tell me to heel.

13:21.501 --> 13:22.602
Uh...

13:22.635 --> 13:24.171
Heel, boy, heel.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.873
Good job. All right,
now, here's another thing

13:25.906 --> 13:29.176
I got to show you.

13:29.209 --> 13:32.445
(zip)
(gasps)

13:32.479 --> 13:35.148
MICHAEL :
Oh, yeah.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.884
I know it's a little weird,
but it's nothing

13:36.917 --> 13:39.686
to be embarrassed of. It's all
part of going on a walk.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.621
(zips)

13:41.654 --> 13:43.356
Ooh.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.358
Oh, I hope you guys
brought a plastic bag.

13:45.392 --> 13:46.994
Oh.
Oh.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.328
Yeah.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.030
Grab a couple.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.165
(grunting)
(laughing)

13:52.199 --> 13:53.800
(phone rings)

13:53.833 --> 13:55.468
Hello.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.237
Mrs. Chance? This is Doris

13:57.270 --> 13:59.339
from the Natesville
Animal Shelter.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.374
Your application
has been approved.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.710
Really? But we're only halfway
through our trial period.

14:03.743 --> 14:06.479
Trial period?
Yeah, Michael says
we're doing great.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.481
Michael? Like, tall, red hair?

14:08.515 --> 14:10.183
Crazy eyes?

14:10.217 --> 14:12.319
He only has crazy eyes when you
challenge his dominance.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.654
He's an oddball who
sometimes volunteers here,

14:14.687 --> 14:16.156
but I certainly
wouldn't recommend

14:16.189 --> 14:17.624
letting him into your home.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.694
Good to know.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.096
Who wants to go to the dog park?

14:23.130 --> 14:24.697
I do.
Yeah.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.433
Are you sure we're doing
the right thing here?

14:26.466 --> 14:29.202
Absolutely.
He's got to be crazy.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.570
He spends all day
working someplace for free.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.372
Who does that?
A volunteer?

14:32.405 --> 14:33.740
No, a crazy person.

14:33.773 --> 14:36.743
All right.

14:36.776 --> 14:39.947
You ready, boy?
Ready, boy?

14:39.980 --> 14:42.149
Go fetch.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.387
(engine starts)

14:49.889 --> 14:51.258
Burt, Burt.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.762
Burt, Burt.

14:55.795 --> 14:56.964
Burt.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.265
Virginia!

15:02.269 --> 15:04.071
Finally, a real dog
that can sniff our butts

15:04.104 --> 15:05.605
and it won't be
totally creepy.

15:05.638 --> 15:08.208
Welcome to your new home,
Puppy Dogstocking.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.842
Now go have fun.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.483
Maybe he doesn't like
that name as much as we do.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.585
(snorts)

15:24.491 --> 15:26.226
It wasn't
the fresh air, Virginia.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.827
He's still not doing much.

15:27.860 --> 15:31.498
Well, somebody chewed the
heel off my church shoe.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.767
Without the heel I'll be three
inches further away from God.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.404
Having a real dog's
a lot different

15:37.437 --> 15:39.272
than I thought it would be.
Yeah.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.474
(beeping)

15:46.146 --> 15:47.314
(sighs)

15:47.347 --> 15:48.948
We should have
just gotten a snake.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.917
They don't do much either,
but at least you know

15:50.950 --> 15:52.119
you'll eventually get a belt.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.420
Yeah.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.755
He'll probably be fun
at some point.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.890
At some point.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.470
Virginia, we adopted
the Tasmanian Devil.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.273
Or... another dog came in

16:13.306 --> 16:15.475
and tore up the place
while our guy

16:15.508 --> 16:17.044
just laid there and watched.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.845
Either way, Puppy Dogstocking's

16:18.878 --> 16:20.480
not very good
at doing dog stuff.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.949
I know.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.852
* Now, being without you

16:25.885 --> 16:30.190
* Takes a lot
of getting used to *

16:30.223 --> 16:33.293
* Should learn to live with it

16:33.326 --> 16:35.162
* But I don't want to

16:35.195 --> 16:38.231
* Being without you

16:38.265 --> 16:41.334
* Is all a big mistake

16:41.368 --> 16:43.503
* Instead of getting easier

16:43.536 --> 16:46.639
* It's the hardest thing
to take *

16:46.673 --> 16:49.642
* I'm addicted to you, babe

16:49.676 --> 16:52.179
* You're a hard habit

16:52.212 --> 16:56.216
* To break...

17:00.287 --> 17:01.654
Oh, my God, Burt.

17:01.688 --> 17:05.092
We're not dog people.

17:05.125 --> 17:08.027
We're Michael people.

17:10.697 --> 17:13.166
* Being without you

17:13.200 --> 17:17.036
* Takes a lot
of getting used to. *

17:18.271 --> 17:21.007
Hey, look at me, I'm Jimmy.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.210
I need a baby to pick up girls.

17:23.243 --> 17:24.577
(laughs)

17:24.611 --> 17:26.246
Thanks for telling
him, Sabrina.
Oh...

17:26.279 --> 17:27.614
Very funny, Frank.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.048
Wait a second--
where did you get the...?

17:29.082 --> 17:30.183
What the hell is wrong with you?

17:30.217 --> 17:31.618
Give me back my baby.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.353
Hi.
(whack)

17:33.386 --> 17:34.587
(grunts)

17:34.621 --> 17:35.855
Ow.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.125
Wow.

17:38.158 --> 17:41.394
That's more attention I've got
from a woman in a long time.

17:41.428 --> 17:42.929
What have I always told you?

17:42.962 --> 17:44.431
Every customer

17:44.464 --> 17:46.966
here at Howdy's has the
reasonable expectation

17:46.999 --> 17:50.069
that their baby won't be
stolen by an employee.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.471
How did this happen?

17:51.504 --> 17:53.606
We're just giving Jimmy
a hard time.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.942
Well, yeah, 'cause he's been
using Hope to flirt with women.

17:55.975 --> 17:58.211
I seem to remember you
doing the same thing.

17:58.245 --> 18:01.381
What? I've never used a baby
to flirt with women.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.250
Well, you used Hope
to flirt with Jimmy.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.952
We were all shocked
because you hated kids.

18:05.985 --> 18:09.622
Somebody's filthy little child
with chocolate on its face

18:09.656 --> 18:11.458
is here at the
register. If someone

18:11.491 --> 18:13.092
would please
come and get it.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.496
Honestly, anybody who's
willing to claim it.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.930
I'm really not
gonna ask questions.

18:17.964 --> 18:20.300
I just really
want it gone.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.402
(sighs)

18:22.435 --> 18:23.903
Oh, hey. Will you
do me a favor?

18:23.936 --> 18:25.338
Will you watch this thing
for a second?

18:25.372 --> 18:27.407
That cute guy is back.
Which one? Sandy blond?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.809
(whispers): No, no,
floppy hair, big nose.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.978
Hi.
(quiet grunt)

18:32.011 --> 18:35.248
Oh, my God.
She is so adorable.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.184
(chuckles)
I love kids.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.251
Do you want to hold her?

18:38.285 --> 18:39.786
No, thank you.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.121
Oh, I mean, I could just
touch her for a second.

18:42.155 --> 18:45.225
(Hope cooing)

18:51.798 --> 18:54.467
Well... (sighs) I swear
I love Hope now. I just...

18:54.501 --> 18:57.170
I wasn't really much of a
kid person before I met her.

18:57.204 --> 18:59.105
Yeah, you didn't even
use your own prop.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.374
You had to use mine.
I'm sorry.

19:01.408 --> 19:04.477
You used my own daughter
to try and get close to me?

19:04.511 --> 19:06.313
That's...

19:06.346 --> 19:07.647
awesome.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.317
You liked me for me.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.452
I thought you were just
into me because of Hope,

19:12.485 --> 19:14.721
but it was the
other way around.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.523
Yeah.
Mm.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.498
Hey.

19:25.532 --> 19:28.268
So, does your mom
come here often?

19:31.238 --> 19:34.040
(exhales)

19:34.073 --> 19:35.542
Michael!

19:35.575 --> 19:37.076
Michael!

19:37.109 --> 19:38.678
(whistles)

19:38.711 --> 19:39.712
Hey. Hey, there he is.

19:39.746 --> 19:40.747
Oh, oh.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.048
Michael.

19:42.081 --> 19:44.251
Here, boy.
Come here, boy.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.685
(whistles)
Good boy.
Good boy,

19:45.718 --> 19:47.153
come on, boy,
good boy.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.087
(tires squeal)
Aah, aah!

19:48.120 --> 19:50.923
Oh! Oh.
Oh.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.360
(sighs) Michael.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.694
Are you okay?

19:54.727 --> 19:56.195
I'm fine, I got
a slight hip fracture.

19:56.229 --> 19:57.430
I'm gonna make a full recovery.

19:57.464 --> 19:59.399
I'm so sorry
we left you in the park.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.033
No, you guys are great. Most
people issue restraining orders.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.435
I knew you were different

20:02.469 --> 20:04.103
when you didn't forget
the plastic bags.

20:04.136 --> 20:06.406
Well, maybe when
you get better,

20:06.439 --> 20:08.508
we can work with you a
little more on street safety.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.243
Maybe you could
still, uh,

20:10.277 --> 20:12.245
come over and we could
play some Frisbee.

20:12.279 --> 20:13.546
I would love that.

20:15.982 --> 20:19.386
JIMMY:
While, ultimately, a disturbed,
lonely man in a dog suit

20:19.419 --> 20:21.854
didn't fill the void
in my parents' lives...

20:21.888 --> 20:23.590
Virginia, look.

20:23.623 --> 20:26.593
...like Lassie, he led them
to something that would.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.830
Puzzles.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.171
*

20:51.017 --> 20:52.919
Oh, are you two
new volunteers?

20:52.952 --> 20:54.821
Oh, no, we're not crazy.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.823
We're happy to hang
out for a bit,

20:56.856 --> 20:58.891
read to the kids,
maybe play some games.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.260
Yeah, we could even come back
and make it a regular thing.

21:01.294 --> 21:02.795
But we're not
volunteers.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.331
Only idiots work
without getting paid.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.932
Hmm.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.900
JIMMY: And even though
my parents found a way

21:07.934 --> 21:10.236
to cure their
empty-nest syndrome,

21:10.269 --> 21:14.273
they still had the occasional
flare-up on the weekends.

21:19.712 --> 21:22.615
Well, I've got bad news
and worse news.

21:24.016 --> 21:27.420
Jerry Garcia died ten years ago.

21:27.454 --> 21:30.323
And LSD does nothing for me.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.525
