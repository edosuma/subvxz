WEBVTT

00:12.333 --> 00:14.417
Timmy's sick,
the baby's sick

00:14.500 --> 00:15.959
and the wife's gonna
give me hell

00:16.041 --> 00:17.709
'cause I forgot her
mint chip ice cream.

00:17.792 --> 00:20.750
[chuckles]
The other night,
Diane says, "Joe,
baby

00:20.834 --> 00:24.041
I'm hankering for some
pickles
with fish sauce."

00:24.125 --> 00:25.750
Pregnant women.

00:25.834 --> 00:28.750
(woman on radio)
'2710 car, go to East Ludlow
and Jones'

00:28.834 --> 00:30.750
'for a domestic disturbance.'

00:30.834 --> 00:33.250
See, now if we answer
that mommy-poppy call

00:33.333 --> 00:35.333
and my mommy's beatin' me
down tonight.

00:36.834 --> 00:38.583
2710 car.
Okay, got
it.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.583
Get outta here.
You split, man.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.291
No, I ain't lettin' you
go out on your own.

00:43.375 --> 00:46.542
I told you to get your ass
home
by midnight, didn't I?

00:46.625 --> 00:48.208
Now, hey, wait
until the kid's born.

00:48.291 --> 00:51.000
That's when you'll really
kiss your life goodbye.

00:51.083 --> 00:53.500
- Yeah.
- I hear you, man.

00:53.583 --> 00:54.959
Thanks, Joe.

01:50.125 --> 01:52.917
(female #1)
'They told me
you got the old murders.'

01:53.000 --> 01:54.166
What?

01:54.250 --> 01:56.667
He said, um..

01:56.750 --> 01:58.333
'...you the one that's got
to listen to this.'

02:00.041 --> 02:01.417
What is it?

02:01.500 --> 02:03.208
I, uh, found it
in a garbage dump

02:03.291 --> 02:06.208
over by the Raymond Jennings
Projects.

02:06.291 --> 02:08.083
You got a name?

02:08.166 --> 02:09.375
Neesey.

02:09.458 --> 02:11.208
Neesey, huh?

02:11.291 --> 02:13.083
That your real name?

02:14.709 --> 02:15.625
Deniece, okay?

02:15.709 --> 02:17.083
Deniece Funderbunk.

02:18.375 --> 02:20.041
I already told him.

02:22.375 --> 02:24.750
So look, um,
I get anything for this?

02:26.083 --> 02:28.125
Just a sincere thanks
for your civic-mindedness.

02:28.208 --> 02:29.583
My civic what?

02:30.458 --> 02:32.041
Thanks, Miss Funderbunk.

02:32.125 --> 02:33.291
I gotta jet.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.458
A garbage dump?

02:42.542 --> 02:44.208
You don't mind a little dirt,
do you, Rush?

02:44.291 --> 02:46.333
I hang around you, don't I?

02:46.417 --> 02:50.250
(man on tape)
'Runner! Runner! Runner!'

03:00.166 --> 03:01.875
Standard cassette
player
and recorder.

03:01.959 --> 03:04.125
Way old
school.
Early 70s.

03:04.208 --> 03:07.417
I transferred the audio
from analog to digital.

03:07.500 --> 03:10.375
The stuff after the
gunshots,
the man's muttering

03:10.458 --> 03:12.125
'I'm still workin' on that.'

03:12.208 --> 03:14.208
But, check this out.

03:14.291 --> 03:16.542
- 'Shan..'
- What's that?

03:16.625 --> 03:19.500
I'm gonna EQ it by rollin'
off
some of the top and bottom.

03:19.583 --> 03:20.917
Filter out the background noise.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.500
(woman on tape)
'Shanning..'

03:23.583 --> 03:26.417
(female #2)
'Tweak it and clean it.
Correct the pitch. Bam.'

03:26.500 --> 03:27.875
(woman on tape)
'Shanning..'

03:30.208 --> 03:32.834
Sounds like some sort
of public announcement system.

03:32.917 --> 03:35.417
Yeah.
And near a railroad station.

03:36.875 --> 03:38.125
(woman on tape)
'Shanning.'

03:38.208 --> 03:39.917
Sh-Shanning Station.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.667
The old train tracks
in North Philly.

03:42.750 --> 03:46.500
They closed that station
some time in the...early 80s.

03:46.583 --> 03:48.959
Uh, a lover's lane.

03:49.041 --> 03:51.125
Oh, and you know this
from experience?

03:52.375 --> 03:54.125
Not a soul around.

03:54.208 --> 03:55.959
Just you and the stars.

03:56.041 --> 03:59.500
(man on tape)
'Runner! Runner! Runner!'

04:01.667 --> 04:03.500
Lonely place to die.

04:39.917 --> 04:42.125
Small caliber weapon,
fired three times

04:42.208 --> 04:44.166
in the vicinity
of Shanning Station.

04:44.250 --> 04:46.458
Before it closed in
'81.
That narrows it
down.

04:46.542 --> 04:48.208
Where the hell is it?

04:48.291 --> 04:49.792
(Jeffries)
'Did you say Shanning
Station?'

04:49.875 --> 04:51.291
Yeah.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.500
You're not gonna find
that box job down
here.

05:02.625 --> 05:04.875
'This one was one of our own.'

05:04.959 --> 05:07.458
Never left homicide.

05:07.542 --> 05:09.959
Thirty years.

05:10.041 --> 05:11.583
Three shots to the heart.

05:11.667 --> 05:13.083
One year on the force.

05:15.166 --> 05:16.834
- Washington?
- Mm-hmm.

05:18.667 --> 05:20.542
He just graduated
from the academy.

05:20.625 --> 05:23.875
Worked in the 27th district.

05:23.959 --> 05:25.875
Raised in a North Carolina
orphanage.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.875
A stint in the military before
entering the police academy.

05:28.959 --> 05:31.583
And Washington was responding
to a domestic call.

05:31.667 --> 05:33.583
Never made it
there,
a few hours later

05:33.667 --> 05:36.542
they found his body
near the Shanning
tracks.

05:36.625 --> 05:38.834
Blood spatter matching
Washington's blood type

05:38.917 --> 05:40.959
was found in a stolen vehicle

05:41.041 --> 05:42.750
left on a turnpike
two days later.

05:42.834 --> 05:45.208
It was mostly a dead end,
and we lifted

05:45.291 --> 05:47.792
a fingerprint off
the car windshield. No hits.

05:49.834 --> 05:51.583
Maybe we run the print again.

05:51.667 --> 05:54.333
I'd like to work with
you
on this one, Lilly.

05:55.875 --> 05:57.709
I knew Joe Washington.

05:57.792 --> 06:00.166
You knew his partner?

06:00.250 --> 06:02.250
Of him. Butch Rinaldi.

06:04.709 --> 06:07.333
(Rush)
Why wasn't he with Washington
that night?

06:07.417 --> 06:09.041
(Rinaldi)
'I let him go out alone.'

06:09.125 --> 06:10.417
Shouldn't have done that.

06:11.583 --> 06:13.041
He must have pulled over
a motorist

06:13.125 --> 06:14.667
that ran a traffic light
or something.

06:16.208 --> 06:18.667
Joe got three bullets
for his trouble.

06:20.625 --> 06:22.792
I was standin' right here

06:22.875 --> 06:26.125
when I first seen Diane
that night.

06:26.208 --> 06:27.500
Joe's wife.

06:33.375 --> 06:36.458
Butchy!
Butchy!

06:41.375 --> 06:43.834
[crying]
Butchy! No!

06:43.917 --> 06:45.458
No!

06:45.542 --> 06:47.083
No!

07:01.250 --> 07:03.709
(Rinaldi)
'Diane lost the baby
a few weeks later.'

07:06.583 --> 07:08.792
You last saw Washington
at 12:00 midnight.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.834
That's when our shift ended.

07:12.917 --> 07:14.709
On the tape,
there's a train horn

07:14.792 --> 07:16.041
seconds after the gunshots.

07:16.125 --> 07:18.166
We checked train schedules
at the museum.

07:18.250 --> 07:21.083
Only one arrival that night.
At 1:00 a.m.

07:21.166 --> 07:22.834
So we can place time of death

07:22.917 --> 07:25.291
about an hour
after you saw Washington.

07:25.375 --> 07:29.166
But, uh, Shanning's only, uh,
five minutes from the
precinct.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.166
Maybe he wasn't headed
to the domestic.

07:31.250 --> 07:33.458
He said he was,
clear as day.

07:33.542 --> 07:35.792
According to the logs,
dispatch sent another call

07:35.875 --> 07:37.542
ten minutes after the domestic.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.875
(Jeffries)
'Drug activity at the
Raymond Jennings Project'

07:40.959 --> 07:42.542
where the tape recorder
was found.

07:42.625 --> 07:45.667
If Washington responded to
that
call, the timeline adds up.

07:45.750 --> 07:48.542
Raymond Jennings
wasn't even in our district.

07:48.625 --> 07:51.291
Why would Joe go there
and not tell no one?

07:51.375 --> 07:52.917
That's what we gotta find out.

08:00.709 --> 08:04.500
I did live in the Raymond
Jennings Project, young lady.

08:04.583 --> 08:07.208
And I called the police
that night.

08:07.291 --> 08:09.875
My tax pays your salary,
you know.

08:09.959 --> 08:11.709
Thirty years is a long time
to remember

08:11.792 --> 08:13.375
a call you made, Miss Gloria.

08:13.458 --> 08:16.875
I remember real good, sir.
You want to know why?

08:16.959 --> 08:20.417
'Cause those damn police
actually came for once.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.750
What does that mean?

08:22.834 --> 08:24.625
Black folks
from the project callin'

08:24.709 --> 08:27.417
on Friday night,
police don't come.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.125
But that night,
that black cop showed
up.

08:30.208 --> 08:32.917
And he gets to
fightin'
with the drug
dealer.

08:34.250 --> 08:36.625
- What drug dealer?
- Never saw him before.

08:36.709 --> 08:40.083
But after I called the police,
I went out to see what
happened.

08:40.166 --> 08:42.291
Not expectin' a damn thing.

08:47.709 --> 08:49.166
(male #1)
'Hey, get off my court, man.'

08:49.250 --> 08:50.375
(Washington)
You don't own
this.

08:50.458 --> 08:52.625
Oh, I own this.
I own you.

08:52.709 --> 08:54.959
I own everythin' you is,
Joe boy.

08:56.834 --> 08:59.583
You ain't better than me.
You just pretend you is.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.375
The dealer called him Joe?

09:11.458 --> 09:14.583
Joe this, Joe that.

09:14.667 --> 09:18.750
That black cop must have come
around the projects regular.

09:18.834 --> 09:21.458
'Cause he knew enough
not to park at the
curb.

09:21.542 --> 09:24.041
Those drug dealers will
see him a-coming a mile away.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.166
What did the drug dealer
look like?

09:26.250 --> 09:30.542
Skinny, young, black.

09:30.625 --> 09:33.625
Struttin' around like
some sorta crazy
rooster.

09:33.709 --> 09:37.750
My eyes been bad since forever.
Can't tell you more.

09:37.834 --> 09:40.166
But I did hear those druggies
callin' him The Runner.

09:41.625 --> 09:43.750
- What?
- The Runner.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.500
'What kinda name is that?'

09:48.417 --> 09:50.000
(Rush)
'Thank you, Miss Munez.'

09:51.875 --> 09:54.709
Washington called the
killer
that on the tape.

09:54.792 --> 09:55.959
The Runner.

09:56.041 --> 09:57.917
'Cause he knew him.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.917
They both knew each other.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.208
Real well.

10:07.166 --> 10:08.875
(Jeffries)
I did patrol of the Raymond
Jennings Projects in the 70s.

10:08.959 --> 10:11.125
Never heard the name,
The Runner.

10:11.208 --> 10:12.333
Guy ain't in the system
anywhere.

10:12.417 --> 10:14.000
No arrests, nothin'.

10:14.083 --> 10:16.834
So how did this Runner
and Washington get so cozy then?

10:16.917 --> 10:18.792
And how did Washington know
those projects enough

10:18.875 --> 10:21.917
to know where to park when he
didn't even work that
district?

10:22.000 --> 10:23.792
Maybe he had it in
for drug dealers.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.375
Washington's patrol log.

10:26.458 --> 10:29.875
Radioed in calls on dealers
in his district constantly.

10:29.959 --> 10:31.709
Got into two altercations.

10:31.792 --> 10:33.291
There's a lot of hate here.

10:33.375 --> 10:34.542
Love hate.

10:34.625 --> 10:36.041
No arrests on his record.

10:36.125 --> 10:37.542
Smoke and mirrors?

10:37.625 --> 10:39.875
Hmm, acts tough
for appearances' sake

10:39.959 --> 10:41.542
but he's really on the take?

10:41.625 --> 10:43.375
Bank records don't show
cash coming in

10:43.458 --> 10:45.667
but there was cash going out
every few weeks.

10:45.750 --> 10:48.291
These didn't cover
his usual living expenses.

10:48.375 --> 10:51.291
He wrote clearly marked checks
for those, and..

10:51.375 --> 10:53.542
...these sums are big enough
to stand out.

10:53.625 --> 10:56.250
So what are we
thinkin'?
He buying drugs?

10:56.333 --> 11:00.125
No, addicts clean out bank
within a couple months.

11:00.208 --> 11:01.875
This doesn't follow
that pattern.

11:01.959 --> 11:03.834
So what was he doin'?

11:03.917 --> 11:05.208
Maybe his widow knows.

11:06.709 --> 11:07.875
(Diane)
'The Runner?'

11:08.000 --> 11:10.250
No, I never heard of him.

11:12.125 --> 11:14.041
(Rush)
How long were you married,
Diane?

11:15.208 --> 11:16.792
Ten months, two weeks.

11:19.041 --> 11:20.458
Was Joe a big spender?

11:20.542 --> 11:24.375
Um, first year
of marriage and all.

11:24.458 --> 11:26.208
No, we just got the house.

11:27.542 --> 11:29.166
Why?

11:29.250 --> 11:34.875
Um, these checks he wrote
for cash every few weeks

11:34.959 --> 11:37.291
um, do you know
what they were for?

11:39.458 --> 11:42.417
He got me flowers every Friday.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.750
'And movies.'

11:45.000 --> 11:46.291
We went to movies all the time.

11:47.667 --> 11:50.667
But I never thought
it would amount to that much.

11:54.375 --> 11:57.041
[sighs]
I thought things would be
different by now.

11:58.333 --> 11:59.875
That I'd be different.

12:03.333 --> 12:05.458
Time makes things worse,
not better.

12:07.333 --> 12:09.166
Maybe time also finds the truth.

12:12.083 --> 12:15.291
Can you tell me what you
remember from that day, Diane?

12:19.709 --> 12:22.250
We were thinking about
what to name our baby.

12:25.250 --> 12:26.333
Our little girl.

12:32.542 --> 12:34.083
- Marianne.
- No.

12:35.583 --> 12:37.500
- Martha.
- Uh-uh.

12:37.583 --> 12:39.834
- Matilda.
- No way.

12:39.917 --> 12:41.792
Okay, Mr. Man,
let me see you

12:41.875 --> 12:43.834
come up with something
more groovy.

12:43.917 --> 12:45.834
- You want groovy, baby?
- Uh-huh.

12:45.917 --> 12:48.750
I want far out
psychedelic
groovy.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.333
- How about Diane?
- Uh-huh.

12:50.417 --> 12:52.000
I'm vibing Diane.

12:52.083 --> 12:54.792
I love Diane.

12:57.875 --> 12:59.417
You do?

12:59.500 --> 13:01.125
What?

13:01.208 --> 13:02.417
Love me?

13:02.500 --> 13:03.834
[kisses]
I do.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.750
- You know what else?
- What?

13:16.917 --> 13:19.083
Joe left for work
20 minutes later..

13:21.333 --> 13:22.750
...and I never saw him again.

13:25.041 --> 13:26.166
I'm sorry.

13:29.959 --> 13:32.375
Sometimes I think..

13:32.458 --> 13:35.083
...my God,
she'd be a woman by now.

13:37.583 --> 13:38.959
My little girl.

13:41.542 --> 13:42.917
'Anyway..'

13:46.041 --> 13:47.166
Um..

13:48.375 --> 13:49.959
...if you think
of anything else.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.333
Detective Rush?

13:57.834 --> 13:59.750
Could you tell from the tape..

14:01.333 --> 14:05.750
...whether Joe was in
pain
when he died?

14:09.166 --> 14:10.291
No.

14:11.500 --> 14:12.667
He wasn't.

14:15.792 --> 14:17.583
(Rush)
'I don't know if Diane
was telling the truth'

14:17.667 --> 14:18.917
about the money.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.625
'Wonder why she was never
asked about it.'

14:20.709 --> 14:22.917
Maybe Butch has an idea.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.250
Tonight's first Thursday
at the Tavern, right?

14:25.333 --> 14:26.542
Bet he'll be there.

14:26.625 --> 14:27.917
You're not
going
to first
Thursday.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.083
Why not?

14:29.166 --> 14:30.583
The old timers
don't take too
kindly

14:30.667 --> 14:32.750
to women crashing
their night with the
boys.

14:32.834 --> 14:34.917
Too bad.
It's a new world.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.917
Look, those dinosaurs
are bad enough sober,
Lilly.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.458
You sayin'
you won't go with me?

14:39.542 --> 14:41.834
I'm saying go see
Butch
in the morning.

14:41.917 --> 14:43.458
Forget the Tavern.

15:01.208 --> 15:03.458
- Ow!
- Hey.

15:06.375 --> 15:08.583
Wife know
you're on a date tonight?

15:08.667 --> 15:11.875
Hey, Butch.
You know Detective Rush.

15:13.125 --> 15:14.125
How you doing, Butch?

15:14.208 --> 15:16.375
This one's for Joe Washington.

15:16.458 --> 15:20.000
And all the guys
who died on the line.

15:20.083 --> 15:21.750
- Yeah, Joe.
- Joe.

15:26.583 --> 15:27.709
We gotta talk.

15:27.792 --> 15:29.834
Yeah, Diane called.

15:29.917 --> 15:32.750
Told me about the crap you came
asking. About Joe's money.

15:32.834 --> 15:34.333
There was money
going out of his account.

15:34.417 --> 15:35.834
You know what it was for?

15:35.917 --> 15:37.834
This ain't no place
to bring a lady, bro.

15:37.917 --> 15:39.500
Any ideas about the money,
Butch?

15:39.583 --> 15:40.750
No.

15:40.834 --> 15:43.291
Turns out Washington
knew Runner real well.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.166
I hope no one's
trying to associate

15:45.250 --> 15:47.875
my fallen partner
with, uh, some drug dealer.

15:47.959 --> 15:49.750
- How do you know Runner, Butch?
- She thinks she can come in--

15:49.834 --> 15:51.750
- Just answer the question.
- Smearing a good cop's name.

15:51.834 --> 15:53.000
Hey.

15:55.083 --> 15:56.834
I'm the one
asking the questions.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.709
So, what's your
question,
detective?

16:04.291 --> 16:06.208
Was Washington paying
someone off?

16:10.166 --> 16:12.208
You know who we got here, boys?

16:12.291 --> 16:14.875
The only female in homicide

16:14.959 --> 16:17.417
workin' cold
cases.
Know why?

16:17.500 --> 16:19.333
Maybe you ought
to sit down, Butch.

16:19.417 --> 16:21.083
'Cause it's in the basement

16:21.166 --> 16:24.458
where the little lady
can dust down the
files.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.458
So how did it go
at the Tavern?

16:46.834 --> 16:48.250
Ass handed to me.

16:49.208 --> 16:51.250
Does that surprise you?

16:51.333 --> 16:53.125
I think Sarreti,
the assigned on the case

16:53.208 --> 16:55.250
suspected the drug angle too.

16:55.333 --> 16:58.000
In an interview, Sarreti did
with Deante Rollins

16:58.083 --> 17:01.250
heroin dealer, his territory
was Raymond Jennings

17:01.333 --> 17:03.000
in the early 70s.

17:03.083 --> 17:05.542
Like Sarreti was wonderin'
about the cash himself.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.709
Mmm, but we can't ask
him
'cause he keeled over

17:07.792 --> 17:09.291
from a heart attack last year.

17:09.375 --> 17:12.750
[sighs]
And back then,
Deante wasn't
sharing.

17:12.834 --> 17:14.250
What about now?

17:14.333 --> 17:16.333
Maybe he's learned
to play with
others.

17:19.625 --> 17:21.834
Never heard of no Runner.

17:21.917 --> 17:22.917
You sure about that?

17:23.041 --> 17:25.792
Like I say, never heard of him.

17:25.875 --> 17:28.291
(Jeffries)
'And your word is bond,
Deante.'

17:28.375 --> 17:30.583
My name is Brother Jamal.

17:30.667 --> 17:33.375
Sure it is.
Asalaam a fakim, my brother.

17:34.375 --> 17:36.291
Like you know what that means.

17:36.375 --> 17:39.083
What does it mean, Jamal?

17:39.166 --> 17:40.458
Peace be with you.

17:42.291 --> 17:44.542
Have you found it yet?

17:44.625 --> 17:47.250
- Peace?
- It's a journey.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.792
There is no it.

17:48.875 --> 17:50.083
There is no end.

17:51.583 --> 17:54.083
A tough road, redemption.

17:54.166 --> 17:55.959
Yes, especially
when you're dealin' smack

17:56.041 --> 17:57.125
to women and children.

17:57.208 --> 18:00.208
I never sold to
children.
Ever.

18:00.291 --> 18:02.750
Back in the day,
we was businessmen.

18:02.834 --> 18:05.834
Organized chains of command.

18:05.917 --> 18:08.333
None of this teenage
gangsta bull today.

18:08.417 --> 18:09.875
- You were disciplined.
- That's right.

18:09.959 --> 18:11.333
Working those basketball courts.

18:11.417 --> 18:14.083
- 24/7, 365.
- Never missed a day.

18:14.166 --> 18:16.625
So you were there that
night
Washington got killed.

18:20.208 --> 18:22.250
And you must have
seen the fight.

18:25.875 --> 18:27.166
Yeah, I seen it.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.417
You don't own this, man.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.583
Oh, I own this.
I own you.

18:30.667 --> 18:32.667
I own everything
you is, Joe boy.

18:35.333 --> 18:37.417
And the cop runs up
into the projects.

18:41.083 --> 18:43.000
What was he doing?

18:43.083 --> 18:45.166
Few minutes later,
he comes running back down.

18:47.583 --> 18:49.750
Sam!

18:52.458 --> 18:54.250
Sammy!

18:54.333 --> 18:57.166
'Sammy! Sam!'

18:57.250 --> 18:58.750
Sammy!

19:00.500 --> 19:02.709
Where did Sammy go to?

19:02.792 --> 19:04.208
What about Runner?
You seen him?

19:04.291 --> 19:05.875
Where did Runner go, huh?

19:05.959 --> 19:08.291
Took off in some car, man.

19:08.375 --> 19:10.917
Towards the tracks, man.

19:23.959 --> 19:25.083
Who's Sammy?

19:25.166 --> 19:26.667
Reason Runner
and his homie split

19:26.750 --> 19:29.417
'cause of something
that happened to her.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.792
Who was his homie?

19:30.875 --> 19:33.250
All's I know
is they was
tight.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.625
'Had the same tattoo
on their knuckles.'

19:40.000 --> 19:43.083
(Ray)
'Here we go. Joseph Washington's
autopsy photo.'

19:43.166 --> 19:45.000
'From the original negative,
I printed onto'

19:45.083 --> 19:46.709
technical pan film
and then transferred

19:46.792 --> 19:49.166
onto high contrast slides.

19:49.250 --> 19:50.458
From what you asked,
I figured

19:50.542 --> 19:51.709
density slicing
might do the trick.

19:51.792 --> 19:52.959
What's that?

19:53.041 --> 19:54.417
It's when you take
each scale of gray

19:54.500 --> 19:56.333
and you print it
as pure black and white.

19:58.291 --> 20:00.208
Is that the best
you can do, Ray?

20:00.291 --> 20:01.709
Matter of fact, I did better.

20:04.291 --> 20:05.542
And better.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.291
'And better.'

20:11.709 --> 20:14.000
(Rush)
'So that's how Washington
knew The Runner.'

20:19.834 --> 20:21.333
Washington hung with
a small-time heroin dealer

20:21.417 --> 20:23.709
called The Runner
in the early 70s.

20:23.792 --> 20:26.333
Oh, we checked juvie records
in the court history
database.

20:26.417 --> 20:28.458
'Used the tattoo
as an identifying mark.'

20:28.542 --> 20:30.709
Meet the real Joe Washington.

20:30.792 --> 20:33.792
Seventeen years old,
arrested for selling smack.

20:33.875 --> 20:36.333
Gave the arresting officer
a false name.

20:36.417 --> 20:39.417
That's why police
background check missed
it.

20:40.458 --> 20:42.917
In a North Carolina orphanage?

20:43.000 --> 20:44.250
Fairy tale.

20:44.333 --> 20:45.500
He grew up in Raymond Jennings.

20:45.583 --> 20:47.083
Straightens out.
Starts flying right.

20:47.166 --> 20:49.792
- Joins the military.
- 'Then the police academy.'

20:49.875 --> 20:52.834
Gets married,
and...we know the rest.

20:52.917 --> 20:55.333
So Washington buried
who he was from everyone.

20:56.875 --> 20:58.291
Even his wife?

20:59.500 --> 21:01.792
I never knew those things
about him.

21:01.875 --> 21:04.291
He never told you
where he really came from?

21:08.417 --> 21:10.875
There were other things he was
hiding from you, weren't there?

21:13.583 --> 21:15.458
Someone robbed you, Diane..

21:15.542 --> 21:17.291
...of your husband,
of your child.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.166
'Don't you think he should pay?'

21:22.917 --> 21:26.542
Everybody wanted to remember
him as this golden boy.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.542
Great cop.

21:30.875 --> 21:32.125
Great husband.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.375
I didn't wanna rain
on their parade.

21:36.458 --> 21:38.041
By doing what?

21:38.125 --> 21:39.500
I knew he was..

21:41.041 --> 21:42.917
He was involved
with somebody else.

21:44.542 --> 21:47.250
Married less than a year
and already cheatin'.

21:47.333 --> 21:48.667
What a joke.

21:53.208 --> 21:56.041
One afternoon, he went
out
to the shooting range

21:56.125 --> 21:57.834
and I needed something
from the store.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.917
So I called him.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.125
He wasn't there.

22:01.208 --> 22:03.000
He never showed up.

22:03.083 --> 22:04.667
'When he came home
that night'

22:04.750 --> 22:08.417
I said, "Hey, baby,
how was target
practice?"

22:10.291 --> 22:12.208
And he
said,
"Fine.

22:13.041 --> 22:14.291
'It was fine."'

22:16.000 --> 22:17.250
I'm sorry.

22:17.333 --> 22:20.083
'He'd go out two,
maybe three times a month.'

22:20.166 --> 22:21.583
One day, I followed him..

22:33.917 --> 22:36.000
- 'Sammy.'
- 'Who's there?'

22:36.083 --> 22:37.375
It's me.

22:49.291 --> 22:52.250
- Her name was Sammy?
- Yes.

22:52.333 --> 22:54.917
And she lived at
the Raymond Jennings Projects?

22:56.291 --> 22:58.166
Did you ever confront
Joe about her?

22:58.250 --> 23:02.583
I was 20 years old and
pregnant.
What was the point?

23:02.667 --> 23:05.458
'And you never told
the assigned detective this?'

23:05.542 --> 23:06.625
Or even Butch?

23:06.709 --> 23:08.458
'Like I said,
what was the point?'

23:09.750 --> 23:11.959
I always wanted
to go back there one day.

23:13.667 --> 23:15.250
Meet her face to face.

23:16.750 --> 23:18.208
'I never did.'

23:32.875 --> 23:35.500
Heads up. You never know when
a TV might fall out of a
window.

23:42.250 --> 23:43.667
(Rush)
'Samuela?'

23:43.750 --> 23:46.667
This must be the girl who
drove
Washington and Runner apart.

23:46.750 --> 23:48.458
Looks like our Sammy.

23:53.250 --> 23:56.667
(Rush)
Think she's still here,
after all these years?

23:56.750 --> 23:59.917
Well, in these projects, where
you're born is where you die.

24:09.083 --> 24:11.333
We're looking
for Samuela Robbins?

24:11.417 --> 24:12.875
Yes, I am she.

24:14.375 --> 24:16.083
You're Miss Samuela?

24:16.166 --> 24:17.667
Yes, I said that already.

24:21.417 --> 24:23.375
Detectives Rush and Jeffries.

24:23.458 --> 24:26.125
- Could we come in?
- I'd rather you not, thank
you.

24:26.208 --> 24:28.917
Did you know a Joe Washington,
Miss Samuela?

24:29.000 --> 24:30.542
You here about Joe?

24:30.625 --> 24:31.875
You should have said so.

24:31.959 --> 24:33.083
Come in.

24:36.458 --> 24:39.083
'Joe grew up
on this very floor.'

24:39.166 --> 24:42.750
Why, he took care of Sammy
ever since they were kids.

24:44.208 --> 24:45.417
Sammy?

24:45.500 --> 24:47.458
My granddaughter, Samantha.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.417
They grew up together?

24:52.500 --> 24:54.625
(Samuela)
'Like brother and sister.'

24:54.709 --> 24:57.959
He'd bring her back
from school every
day.

24:58.041 --> 24:59.792
Real protective.

25:01.458 --> 25:05.709
She was all the love
he had in the world.

25:05.792 --> 25:07.458
Do you remember
when you last saw him?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.250
Well, after he moved out

25:10.333 --> 25:12.417
he used to come by
all the time.

25:12.500 --> 25:15.917
Bring her toys,
take her to the
fair.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.500
Why, on that night, he..

25:18.583 --> 25:21.166
- The night he what?
- 'Oh..'

25:21.250 --> 25:24.000
- No, I-I don't know.
- The night he was killed.

25:24.083 --> 25:25.500
Isn't that what you mean?

25:25.583 --> 25:27.542
Uh, no. I don't know anything.

25:27.625 --> 25:28.917
I don't.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.917
Joe loved your granddaughter

25:31.000 --> 25:32.625
like his own blood, didn't he?

25:32.709 --> 25:34.417
Yes, he did.

25:34.500 --> 25:37.834
And he came here the night
he was killed, didn't he?

25:40.208 --> 25:41.709
Yes, he did.

25:48.375 --> 25:50.041
(Samuela)
'Joe?'

25:50.125 --> 25:51.291
He think he owns me.

25:51.375 --> 25:53.417
- Owns Sammy.
- What's wrong?

25:53.500 --> 25:55.625
I-I thought Sammy
was in her room.

25:55.709 --> 25:57.834
Oh, she's messing with Runner,
takes him them drugs.

25:57.917 --> 26:00.417
You know that, Mrs. Samuela?

26:00.500 --> 26:02.041
Uh, she won't listen to me

26:02.125 --> 26:05.125
and I can't keep her
in the house all day.

26:05.208 --> 26:06.834
I'm sorry, Miss Samuela.

26:06.917 --> 26:08.792
I know it ain't your fault.

26:08.875 --> 26:10.583
It's just the way
things go around here.

26:11.875 --> 26:13.667
Now it's my turn
to take care of Sammy.

26:14.875 --> 26:16.041
You know we talked about this.

26:16.125 --> 26:17.625
You know she gots
to get out of here

26:17.709 --> 26:19.875
'if she's ever gonna
have a chance for a life.'

26:33.917 --> 26:36.000
(Samuela)
'That night, Joe was killed'

26:36.083 --> 26:37.417
and Sammy..

26:37.500 --> 26:39.875
It was
difficult,
you understand?

26:39.959 --> 26:42.792
'No mother, no father.
Just me and Joe.'

26:42.875 --> 26:45.542
And then, he was gone.

26:45.625 --> 26:49.250
So why didn't you come forward
when Joe was murdered?

26:49.333 --> 26:51.625
There was nothing I could do
to bring him back.

26:53.417 --> 26:56.000
And Sammy? Where is she?

26:56.083 --> 26:58.875
I haven't seen her
in over 20 years.

26:58.959 --> 27:03.083
The drugs, they kinda
took her over when Joe died.

27:04.583 --> 27:06.667
Did you know someone..

27:06.750 --> 27:08.000
...called The Runner?

27:09.250 --> 27:10.542
Joe's best friend.

27:12.083 --> 27:13.542
Mason Tucker.

27:13.625 --> 27:16.917
'They went to the Catholic
school together, ran track.'

27:18.667 --> 27:20.417
(Rush)
'So that's why the nickname.'

27:27.917 --> 27:30.583
Long way from Raymond Jennings,
aren't you, Mason?

27:33.583 --> 27:35.709
Can I help you?

27:35.792 --> 27:38.291
Detectives Rush and Jeffries.
Homicide.

27:40.166 --> 27:42.208
'We just had a few questions.'

27:42.291 --> 27:44.875
About Joe Washington?

27:44.959 --> 27:46.583
(Jeffries)
Oh, your homie
from high school?

27:46.667 --> 27:48.291
Your little drug-runnin' buddy?

27:51.333 --> 27:54.208
I knew Joe.
What's your
point?

27:54.291 --> 27:55.667
The night he was murdered,
we got witnesses

27:55.750 --> 27:57.917
in the projects saying
you two had a fight.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.500
I don't remember no fight.

28:00.583 --> 28:02.125
(Jeffries)
'Of course not.'

28:02.208 --> 28:03.709
Remember what you were
fighting about?

28:03.792 --> 28:05.667
I'll say it again,
I don't remember.

28:07.208 --> 28:08.917
How about Sammy?

28:09.000 --> 28:10.333
'Do you remember her?'

28:12.959 --> 28:14.291
Your point being?

28:14.375 --> 28:16.333
Oh, the girl had a lot of
problems, and from what I hear

28:16.417 --> 28:17.917
you had something
to do with it.

28:19.333 --> 28:21.417
Whatever problems
Sammy had

28:21.500 --> 28:23.500
were Joe's
doing,
not mine.

28:25.208 --> 28:26.750
That's not what I hear.

28:26.834 --> 28:28.875
I hear it was all
on you, Mason.

28:28.959 --> 28:33.000
Then I suggest you check
the hospital records
yourself.

28:33.083 --> 28:35.291
He was the one who
brought her in, not
me.

28:37.125 --> 28:39.125
Now, if you don't
have anything else

28:39.208 --> 28:41.000
'I'd like to enjoy
my afternoon.'

28:42.875 --> 28:44.625
Oh, uh, one last question.

28:44.709 --> 28:47.750
How does one go from
selling smack to selling
Jags?

28:49.834 --> 28:51.417
Children do dumb things.

28:53.083 --> 28:55.375
I'm sure you did
too,
Detective Rush.

28:56.917 --> 28:58.291
That isn't who I am now.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.917
(Rush)
'Sammy was like a little
sister
to Washington.'

29:04.000 --> 29:05.625
He felt responsible for her

29:05.709 --> 29:09.333
so he flips when she starts
muling drugs for Mason Tucker.

29:11.542 --> 29:13.083
The night of the
murder,
Washington hears

29:13.166 --> 29:14.917
a radio call
about drug activity

29:15.000 --> 29:16.417
at the Raymond Jennings
Projects.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.333
And from the description,
he knows it's Mason?

29:18.417 --> 29:21.834
No, he goes to the projects,
fights with Mason

29:21.917 --> 29:23.834
gets Sammy's grandma
to okay his plan

29:23.917 --> 29:26.291
to get her out of there,
but when he comes back down..

29:26.375 --> 29:27.542
(Jeffries)
'Sammy's gone.'

29:27.625 --> 29:29.166
Washington hears
Mason took off

29:29.250 --> 29:30.500
for the railroad tracks.

29:30.583 --> 29:31.834
He follows.

29:31.917 --> 29:33.917
And that's where
he ends up dead.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.375
And Mason drops off
the face of the earth.

29:37.458 --> 29:39.667
Only to re-emerge
as a law-abiding

29:39.750 --> 29:41.959
yacht-owning citizen
years later.

29:42.041 --> 29:44.542
Deante talked about
an incident that went
down

29:44.625 --> 29:47.333
between Mason,
Sammy and Washington

29:47.417 --> 29:48.583
years before the murder.

29:48.667 --> 29:50.041
Do we know what it was?

29:50.125 --> 29:52.041
Only that it put her
in the hospital.

29:53.750 --> 29:56.333
Mm-hmm. Please,
don't let it be
that.

29:57.291 --> 29:58.959
We gotta look at it.

29:59.041 --> 30:01.667
The nearest emergency room
is St. Joseph's.

30:01.750 --> 30:04.458
Well, the best person to ask
is Sammy herself.

30:04.542 --> 30:06.125
Check narcotic intelligence.

30:06.208 --> 30:07.709
(Vera)
'Just got the news.'

30:07.792 --> 30:09.959
We got a hit on the
fingerprint
inside the stolen car.

30:11.291 --> 30:13.375
The killer's car?

30:13.458 --> 30:15.333
The print in the car
matches Samantha Robbins.

30:16.959 --> 30:19.875
[sighs]
Sammy was in the car
when Washington got killed.

30:34.875 --> 30:36.667
Thanks for the tip
about the hospital.

30:37.917 --> 30:41.500
So Sammy OD'd on heroin
in 1971.

30:41.583 --> 30:44.667
Now, how's a little
girl
get her hands on
that?

30:44.750 --> 30:46.542
- I wouldn't know.
- Huh!

30:46.625 --> 30:50.583
No? 'Cause Washington told
the doctors you gave it to
her.

30:50.667 --> 30:52.000
That's a lie.

30:53.208 --> 30:54.875
You're right.

30:54.959 --> 30:56.250
You know what, Mason?

30:56.333 --> 30:58.750
I'm like you.
I lie a lot.

31:00.208 --> 31:01.667
Let's both try something new.

31:02.709 --> 31:04.041
The truth.

31:07.041 --> 31:08.417
Sure.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.417
I'll tell you the truth.

31:10.500 --> 31:11.959
You wanna know
what happened to Sammy?

31:13.333 --> 31:15.208
<i>(Mason)</i>
<i>It was during high school.</i>

31:15.291 --> 31:18.000
<i>Me and Washington were</i>
<i>getting high all the time.</i>

31:27.709 --> 31:31.458
Hey, hey, you're my bro,
you know that man?

31:31.542 --> 31:33.375
'You all I got, Washington.'

31:34.542 --> 31:37.208
We gonna own this world,
you and me.

31:37.291 --> 31:38.792
- 'Right.'
- Yeah.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.458
(Sammy)
Can I play?

31:53.542 --> 31:54.875
Get outta here.

31:57.250 --> 31:59.417
Please?
I wanna play the game.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.000
I said get outta here!

32:01.083 --> 32:02.709
Don't yell at the angel, bro.

32:05.875 --> 32:07.166
Sammy, put that down.

32:07.250 --> 32:09.125
(Mason)
'Shut up, Washington.'

32:09.208 --> 32:10.250
Ow!

32:13.458 --> 32:15.917
So that's why he went his way
and you went yours?

32:16.000 --> 32:18.041
Seems to be the way
the ball bounced.

32:18.125 --> 32:21.709
Mason, I know Sammy was in the
car that night Joe was killed.

32:21.792 --> 32:24.834
Who told you that?
A middle-aged heroin whore?

32:26.250 --> 32:29.083
Joe was running from
his guilt about Sammy.

32:29.166 --> 32:30.667
What about you?

32:30.750 --> 32:32.291
What are you running from?

32:42.291 --> 32:43.625
You wanna talk to me..

32:45.250 --> 32:46.583
...talk to my lawyer..

32:47.792 --> 32:48.959
...bitch.

32:53.834 --> 32:56.375
Cop on Kensington
said Sammy's in here.

32:56.458 --> 32:58.875
Coming on the end
of her 28 days.

32:58.959 --> 33:00.542
This her first time in detox?

33:00.625 --> 33:02.875
Uh-huh, bet it won't
be her last.

33:02.959 --> 33:05.542
- Maybe it will be.
- 'Why?'

33:05.625 --> 33:07.625
'Cause maybe she's
looking
for forgiveness.

33:13.375 --> 33:16.417
I thought Denise Funderbunk
was a pretty weird name.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.792
One of the counselors
here,
that's her name.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.291
For real.

33:26.417 --> 33:28.000
Thanks for bringing in
the tape recorder.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.625
Your tape recorder.

33:30.709 --> 33:31.917
Why are you here anyway?

33:32.000 --> 33:33.667
Why ain't you out arresting
the guy who did it?

33:34.792 --> 33:36.125
We need your help, Sammy.

33:37.834 --> 33:39.000
I'm clean outta help.

33:39.083 --> 33:41.208
Ain't got nothing to give.

33:41.291 --> 33:43.125
- Sorry.
- 'Oh!'

33:43.208 --> 33:46.667
It's all about you, isn't it?
Always getting in trouble.

33:46.750 --> 33:49.208
'Always waiting for someone
to bail you out.'

33:49.291 --> 33:51.750
That's why Joe came
to the projects that night.

33:51.834 --> 33:54.041
That's why he died,
helping you.

33:54.125 --> 33:55.667
Helping me?

33:55.750 --> 33:57.166
Helping me?

33:57.250 --> 33:58.667
He lied to me.

33:58.750 --> 34:01.583
He promised and then,
he just went and died.

34:04.500 --> 34:06.083
What did Joe promise you..

34:07.291 --> 34:08.458
...the night he died?

34:08.542 --> 34:10.458
He promised to take me home.

34:16.166 --> 34:17.667
(Mason)
'Hey, get off of my car,
man.'

34:17.750 --> 34:20.375
- You don't own this.
- Well, I own this.

34:20.458 --> 34:21.375
I own you.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.375
I own everything you is,
Joe boy.

34:25.750 --> 34:26.792
(Joe)
'You ain't better than me.'

34:26.875 --> 34:28.667
You just pretend you is.

34:31.792 --> 34:33.041
'Sammy!'

34:36.125 --> 34:38.125
Sammy!

34:38.208 --> 34:39.875
Look, I told you
not to mess with Mason.

34:39.959 --> 34:41.417
I told you
not to touch that crap.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.125
I didn't do nothing.
You can't tell me what to do.

34:43.208 --> 34:44.792
- You ain't my daddy.
- 'Cause you ain't got no
daddy.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.333
You ain't got nobody.
I'm all you got.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.542
You, shut up.
You, shut up.

34:50.250 --> 34:51.750
Calm down, calm down.

34:54.083 --> 34:55.125
Come here.

34:57.458 --> 34:59.208
My wife's gonna
take care of you.

34:59.291 --> 35:01.333
Give you the love
you don't know.

35:01.417 --> 35:03.667
Let's go up
and talk to your grandma.

35:03.750 --> 35:06.000
She won't let me go.

35:06.083 --> 35:07.333
I'll go, okay?

35:08.583 --> 35:10.458
You stay here
and wait for me, okay?

35:11.709 --> 35:13.709
That Mason don't own you, Sammy.

35:13.792 --> 35:15.792
You own you.

35:15.875 --> 35:16.917
Really?

35:19.083 --> 35:21.041
You gonna wait for me or what?

35:23.709 --> 35:24.834
Gimme some skin.

35:37.792 --> 35:40.542
(Sammy)
'He went up
and never came down.'

35:40.625 --> 35:41.667
That's all I know.

35:41.750 --> 35:43.333
Hmm. Really?

35:44.792 --> 35:46.875
Really.

35:46.959 --> 35:50.250
(Jeffries)
'And how did your tape
recorder
get in Mason's car?'

35:50.333 --> 35:51.542
And your fingerprint?

35:51.625 --> 35:53.709
[chuckles]
You think this is
over?

35:53.792 --> 35:55.583
Just 'cause you dropped
a tape recorder on my desk?

35:55.667 --> 35:57.959
Did you ever hear of the,
uh, eighth step, Sammy?

35:59.208 --> 36:00.417
Making amends.

36:01.542 --> 36:03.083
It's not over.

36:03.166 --> 36:04.375
Not till you tell me
what happened

36:04.458 --> 36:06.125
on those tracks that night.

36:10.834 --> 36:14.000
Big old, bad Mason
don't own you.

36:14.083 --> 36:15.750
You own you.

36:34.417 --> 36:36.542
(Mason)
'You think you can
just walk on out'

36:36.625 --> 36:37.875
..after all I done for you?

36:39.166 --> 36:40.583
I gotta pee, Runner.

36:40.667 --> 36:43.709
Well, he thinks he can take
what's mine and walk away?

36:44.792 --> 36:45.959
I own you.

36:46.041 --> 36:48.333
He don't own you. I do.

36:53.083 --> 36:54.083
Come here. Come here.

36:54.166 --> 36:55.959
- Aah!
- Come here.

36:58.500 --> 36:59.625
'Come..'

37:04.166 --> 37:05.458
Runner!

37:05.542 --> 37:08.000
Runner! Runner!

37:10.417 --> 37:12.333
When I woke up, we weren't
at the tracks any more.

37:12.417 --> 37:14.083
We was headed back
to the projects.

37:15.458 --> 37:17.375
Mason was driving,
and talkin', and..

37:19.208 --> 37:20.792
...he just kept
talkin' to hisself.

37:21.959 --> 37:23.208
What was he saying?

37:24.041 --> 37:26.166
[laughs]
The Lord's prayer.

37:28.959 --> 37:31.834
He left me near the garbage
dump
outside my building.

37:38.709 --> 37:39.959
Like a piece of trash.

37:54.417 --> 37:56.208
You never answered
my question.

37:59.375 --> 38:01.000
About why you're running.

38:02.667 --> 38:04.125
And why it never ends.

38:06.250 --> 38:07.583
The running.

38:08.917 --> 38:10.083
I'm not talking to you.

38:10.166 --> 38:12.333
I'm talking to you.

38:12.417 --> 38:14.875
'Fact is, I'm here
to arrest you.'

38:14.959 --> 38:16.208
So sit down.

38:17.959 --> 38:19.291
'We found Sammy.'

38:21.083 --> 38:22.834
You were wrong.

38:22.917 --> 38:24.542
You don't own her.

38:31.250 --> 38:32.583
I know you.

38:34.625 --> 38:36.041
You don't know
a thing about me.

38:36.125 --> 38:38.542
I know what
it's like to
run..

38:39.917 --> 38:41.792
'...from who you are.'

38:41.875 --> 38:43.542
I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.125
'From what you did.'

38:47.000 --> 38:49.625
But you can't, can you?

38:51.709 --> 38:54.291
So you spend your whole
life
running.

38:57.625 --> 39:01.208
(Joe on tape)
'Runner! Runner! Runner!'

39:07.542 --> 39:10.000
(Mason on tape)
'Our Father'

39:10.083 --> 39:11.500
'who art in heaven.'

39:11.583 --> 39:12.917
What are you doing here?

39:13.000 --> 39:15.750
'Hallowed be thy name.'

39:15.834 --> 39:17.750
- 'You're praying.'
- 'Thy kingdom come.'

39:17.834 --> 39:19.417
'Thy will be done
on earth..'

39:21.041 --> 39:22.709
You were asking
for forgiveness.

39:24.709 --> 39:25.917
Remember?

39:29.625 --> 39:32.542
He should have never tried
to change things.

39:32.625 --> 39:33.583
He should have never come back.

39:33.667 --> 39:35.125
He should-he should..

39:35.208 --> 39:36.750
He-he..

39:42.041 --> 39:44.375
He was all the love
I had in this world.

39:50.917 --> 39:52.792
Joe was looking
for forgiveness.

39:55.542 --> 39:57.750
I think you are too.

39:57.834 --> 39:59.291
'It's time, isn't it?'

39:59.375 --> 40:03.125
'To forgive yourself...Runner?'

40:06.083 --> 40:07.458
Runner!

40:07.542 --> 40:08.625
'Runner!'

40:09.542 --> 40:10.667
'Runner!'

42:00.417 --> 42:01.417
Hi.

42:01.500 --> 42:02.917
I wanted to come here, Diane

42:03.000 --> 42:05.041
to tell you about Sammy.

42:05.125 --> 42:08.083
She wasn't
your husband's
mistress.

42:08.166 --> 42:11.667
She was a little girl
at that time Joe grew up
with.

42:11.750 --> 42:17.250
That he loved,
and he had a-a debt to
her.

42:17.333 --> 42:19.542
So I brought her home to you.

42:26.041 --> 42:28.291
Diane.

42:28.375 --> 42:29.458
Sammy.
