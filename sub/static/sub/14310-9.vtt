00:06.070 --> 00:09.130
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:09.150 --> 00:13.070
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:13.089 --> 00:17.100
They called themselves Smurfs.
They were good.

00:23.089 --> 00:29.019
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard. He was bad.

00:29.039 --> 00:32.070
Oh, I hate Smurfs.

00:32.090 --> 00:34.009
I'll get you.

00:34.030 --> 00:37.170
I'll get all of you, if
it's the last thing I ever do!

00:37.189 --> 00:39.130
[Gargamel laughing]

00:39.149 --> 00:40.219
[Gargamel grunts]

00:41.000 --> 00:42.149
Oh, I'll get you.

00:42.170 --> 00:45.219
I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry!

00:46.000 --> 00:48.030
(male narrator)
Well, the forest is still there

00:48.049 --> 00:52.039
and if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:52.060 --> 00:55.039
And if you are good,
you may just catch

00:55.060 --> 00:57.200
a glimpse of the Smurfs.

01:05.019 --> 01:07.099
[instrumental music]

01:27.099 --> 01:28.150
Good work, Handy.

01:29.180 --> 01:31.060
[music continues]

01:33.069 --> 01:37.060
Let's pick up the pace a bit,
Grouchy. You're smurfing behind.

01:37.079 --> 01:38.210
I hate Brainy.

01:38.229 --> 01:43.210
(Brainy)
'Hefty Smurf, stop!
You'll break your smurf.'

01:43.229 --> 01:47.200
Wait. I'm coming up.

01:47.219 --> 01:50.109
I see you haven't heard
the wise old saying

01:50.129 --> 01:54.000
about the smurf sitting
on the wrong side of the branch.

01:54.020 --> 01:55.200
Think before you smurf.

01:55.219 --> 01:58.210
What's going to happen
when that branch smurfs off?

01:58.229 --> 02:03.079
Saw from the other side. See.

02:03.099 --> 02:05.180
- You mean like this?
- Right.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.180
Now you can go on
sawing smurf and sound.

02:08.199 --> 02:12.009
Aren't you lucky
I was smurfing by?

02:12.030 --> 02:14.219
I sure was, Brainy.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.079
Well, I hope this will
teach you to be more..

02:20.030 --> 02:21.150
...careful!

02:21.170 --> 02:23.170
thud

02:23.189 --> 02:25.079
[instrumental music]

02:30.129 --> 02:31.199
That's the ticket!

02:31.219 --> 02:35.069
Smurf those logs together,
but make sure they're tight.

02:35.090 --> 02:38.170
Remember, a smurf in time
saves nine and..

02:38.189 --> 02:41.009
[snoring]

02:41.030 --> 02:45.199
Lazy Smurf, it's very naughty
smurfing on the job like that.

02:45.219 --> 02:49.159
I'll tell Papa Smurf and he's
not gonna like this one little..

02:52.229 --> 02:54.069
thud

02:54.090 --> 02:58.099
Papa Smurf, where
are you when I need you?

02:58.120 --> 03:00.060
[instrumental music]

03:05.020 --> 03:08.219
And a pinch of Mandrake root
as a smurfanish.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.039
There. Now to see
if this new fertilizer works.

03:14.020 --> 03:15.139
[instrumental music]

03:20.199 --> 03:23.060
'Come on you lazy daisy.'

03:26.000 --> 03:29.030
Ah, it's growing.
That's it.

03:29.050 --> 03:34.000
I've done it.
I've got flower power.

03:34.020 --> 03:36.069
[intense music]

03:36.090 --> 03:38.110
Oh, my! What's happening?

03:38.129 --> 03:40.060
I-I must have made a mistake.

03:43.099 --> 03:45.120
Yes, I added a smurf too much.

03:45.139 --> 03:47.030
Huh?

03:47.050 --> 03:49.060
Yipe!

03:50.210 --> 03:52.180
Smurfiverous plant!

03:57.079 --> 03:59.219
Would you bite
the hand that waters you?

04:02.039 --> 04:04.159
Here, stick to this, will you?

04:04.180 --> 04:06.099
[crunching]

04:08.189 --> 04:12.060
Hey! Smurf your tangles off me.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.090
[growling]

04:16.040 --> 04:18.170
'Help! Help!'

04:18.189 --> 04:21.040
That's Papa Smurf.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.009
(both)
Papa Smurf.

04:23.029 --> 04:25.120
[gasping]
Quick! Quick!

04:25.139 --> 04:27.180
I c-can't breathe.

04:27.199 --> 04:30.199
Let go of Papa Smurf,
you gone crazy daisy.

04:30.220 --> 04:33.079
[instrumental music]

04:41.189 --> 04:43.040
He-e-lp!

04:43.060 --> 04:46.079
Hefty, go straight
for the root of the matter.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.029
Right, Papa Smurf.

04:56.079 --> 04:57.100
Ouch.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.000
Are you alright, Papa Smurf?

04:59.019 --> 05:02.100
Yes, but this new fertilizer
I invented, it's dangerous.

05:02.120 --> 05:05.009
I cannot change it,
so take it to the desert

05:05.029 --> 05:07.009
beyond the forest
and bury it.

05:07.029 --> 05:09.170
Okay, Papa Smurf.
Come on, Lazy.

05:09.189 --> 05:11.000
[snoring]

05:15.220 --> 05:17.160
[instrumental music]

05:21.220 --> 05:24.000
It's a smurf of a long way
to the desert.

05:24.019 --> 05:28.009
I'm tired. My feet are tired.
This shovel is getting heavy.

05:28.029 --> 05:30.160
Can we stop for a nap?

05:30.180 --> 05:32.050
[yawns]

05:32.069 --> 05:34.079
Hey, look at that.

05:34.100 --> 05:37.139
A ravine. For what?

05:37.159 --> 05:40.069
(Lazy)
'Well, it's a lot closer
than the desert.'

05:42.069 --> 05:44.120
Yeah.

05:44.139 --> 05:47.100
Wait. Papa Smurf told us
to smurf it underground.

05:47.120 --> 05:50.159
Well, what ground could be
further under than that?

05:50.180 --> 05:54.189
(Hefty)
'Well, um, I suppose it is.'

05:54.209 --> 05:56.069
Here goes!

05:59.040 --> 06:00.149
Good riddance.

06:02.019 --> 06:04.040
Ha! Can't smurf us
any more trouble now.

06:04.060 --> 06:06.100
Yeah. We should make it
back to the village

06:06.120 --> 06:08.100
just in time for bed.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.220
[yawns]

06:15.079 --> 06:16.230
[chirping]

06:22.019 --> 06:23.139

06:29.009 --> 06:30.209
plop

06:33.139 --> 06:35.110
[instrumental music]

06:41.189 --> 06:45.120
Oh, this is terrible. I feel
so guilty I can't even sleep.

06:45.139 --> 06:47.000
Maybe Hefty was right.

06:47.019 --> 06:49.110
We should have smurfed that
fertilizer in the desert

06:49.129 --> 06:51.230
like Papa Smurf said.

06:53.170 --> 06:56.139
M-m-maybe Hefty
will know what to do.

06:56.159 --> 06:58.000
W-w-hat's that?

06:58.019 --> 06:59.120
[screeching]

06:59.139 --> 07:02.079
What's smurfing on?
I-I-I better go home.

07:02.100 --> 07:04.139
[screeching]
'Howlihowl.'

07:07.139 --> 07:09.209
[gasps]
W-w-what is it?

07:09.230 --> 07:11.160
Who is there?

07:11.180 --> 07:12.220
[screeching]

07:13.000 --> 07:15.069
- 'Howlihowl!'
- Yikes!

07:15.089 --> 07:16.189
splash

07:19.139 --> 07:22.100
[screeching]
'Holihowl.'

07:22.120 --> 07:24.199
Hey, who's disturbing
my beauty sleep?

07:24.220 --> 07:27.079
- What's all the noise?
- I hate noise!

07:27.100 --> 07:29.050
No, it wasn't my trumpet!

07:29.069 --> 07:31.129
Oh, dear!
Is every smurf alright?

07:31.149 --> 07:33.149
Papa Smurf says
that noise in the night

07:33.170 --> 07:35.199
upsets your balance
for the next day--

07:35.220 --> 07:37.019
What's all this racket?

07:37.040 --> 07:38.189
Has anything happened
to any smurf?

07:38.209 --> 07:42.120
Me, Papa Smurf. It went flap
flap. And then it went whoom.

07:42.139 --> 07:47.110
And I saw a huge shadow and it
smurfed out a loud howlihowl.

07:47.129 --> 07:50.230
A loud howlihowl? Hmm.

07:51.009 --> 07:53.040
(Hefty)
'Papa Smurf, Papa Smurf.'

07:53.060 --> 07:56.189
The storehouse is wrecked and
all the food has been smurfed.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.000
The storehouse?

07:59.110 --> 08:02.079
Oh! Who could have
smurfed such a thing?

08:02.100 --> 08:04.089
Papa Smurf,
come look at this.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.139
Bird tracks.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.209
That bird must be
a real monster.

08:09.230 --> 08:12.149
[intense music]

08:15.220 --> 08:18.170
So a giant bird
ate all our food.

08:18.189 --> 08:21.100
All those chestnuts
and corn and sarsaparilla.

08:21.120 --> 08:23.120
And all that yummy honey.

08:25.060 --> 08:28.129
Why smurf, I just hope
it hasn't destroyed the bridge.

08:28.149 --> 08:32.179
'We wouldn't be able to cross
the river and get more food.'

08:32.200 --> 08:35.149
All of you come with me
to check the bridge.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.090
I hate checking bridges.

08:43.190 --> 08:47.029
(Papa Smurf)
Well, it seems to be
smurf and sound.

08:47.049 --> 08:50.220
Then, we better get more food.
Right, Papa Smurf?

08:51.000 --> 08:54.230
[screeching]
Howlihowlihowl!

08:55.009 --> 08:57.100
Yipe. The monster bird.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.230
- But where did it come from?
- I hate monster birds.

09:01.009 --> 09:03.139
Look out, here it comes again.

09:03.159 --> 09:06.179
Howlihowlihowl!

09:08.000 --> 09:10.070
[screeching]
Howlihowl!

09:10.090 --> 09:12.019
(Papa Smurf)
'It's smurfing our bridge.'

09:12.039 --> 09:13.210
[all clamoring]

09:17.230 --> 09:20.029
I hate falling.

09:20.049 --> 09:21.139
splash

09:21.159 --> 09:23.129
Howlihowlihowl!

09:26.090 --> 09:28.149
Every smurf
back to the village.

09:28.169 --> 09:31.000
[intense music]

09:37.019 --> 09:38.149
Look out!

09:38.169 --> 09:40.070
[all screaming]

09:41.169 --> 09:45.139
[screeching]
Howlihowl!

09:45.159 --> 09:47.220
This way!
I know a hiding place.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.190
Howlihowlihowl!

09:50.210 --> 09:53.019
[intense music]

09:53.039 --> 09:55.159
Ooh, come on,
you big featherheaded..

09:55.179 --> 09:58.159
Howlihowlihowl!

09:58.179 --> 10:01.139
(Grouchy)
'I hate darkness.'

10:01.159 --> 10:03.070
[screeching]

10:03.090 --> 10:06.059
(Smurfette)
Oh, this is so scary.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.019
What are we gonna do,
Papa Smurf?

10:08.039 --> 10:11.039
(Papa Smurf)
We'll help with that
birdbrain yet. Follow me.

10:17.179 --> 10:19.110
Howlihowl!

10:19.129 --> 10:21.080
(Brainy)
You're so smart, Papa Smurf.

10:21.100 --> 10:24.129
I never worry
when you're around.

10:24.149 --> 10:27.169
Howlihowlihowl!

10:27.190 --> 10:29.129
He-e-lp!

10:29.149 --> 10:31.129
[Jokey laughs]

10:33.100 --> 10:36.019
Every smurf
to the meeting place.

10:36.039 --> 10:38.009
[screeching]

10:39.149 --> 10:43.029
I've called this meeting to
tell you we're in grave danger.

10:43.049 --> 10:45.090
We must smurf away
to protect ourselves

10:45.110 --> 10:47.179
from this,
this smurfiverous bird.

10:47.200 --> 10:51.159
I hate smurfidef, uh,
smurf-mm-sm..

10:51.179 --> 10:54.039
I hate birds.

10:54.059 --> 10:56.090
Smurfiverous? Hmm.

10:56.110 --> 10:58.169
That bird reminds me
of the plant

10:58.190 --> 11:00.090
that attacked me in my lab.

11:00.110 --> 11:03.070
I told you we should've
smurfed it in the desert.

11:03.090 --> 11:06.200
- Yeah, but you--
- 'Hefty? Lazy?'

11:06.220 --> 11:08.100
(both)
Yes, Papa Smurf?

11:08.120 --> 11:10.110
Did you bury
the fertilizer potion

11:10.129 --> 11:12.049
in the desert like I told you?

11:12.070 --> 11:15.200
Well, uh, Lazy, I mean,
uh, well, the truth is--

11:15.220 --> 11:18.139
We smurfed it
into a ravine, Papa Smurf.

11:18.159 --> 11:20.019
A ravine?

11:20.039 --> 11:23.139
How could you disobey my orders
on such an important matter?

11:23.159 --> 11:27.210
And you should never disobey
Papa Smurf's orders because..

11:27.230 --> 11:30.179
Howlihowlihowl!

11:30.200 --> 11:32.120
Take cover!

11:32.139 --> 11:35.149
[screeching]
Howlihowl.

11:35.169 --> 11:37.159
[clamoring]

11:37.179 --> 11:40.179
[screeching]
Howlihowl!

11:45.200 --> 11:48.090
Howlihowlihowli!

11:48.110 --> 11:51.009
Howlihowlihowli!

11:51.029 --> 11:53.080
Howlihowlihowli!

11:56.159 --> 11:59.009
Howlihowlihowl!

11:59.029 --> 12:03.029
So you see what comes of
disobeying Papa Smurf's orders?

12:03.049 --> 12:06.220
You smurf all sorts of
trouble down on your...head.

12:09.129 --> 12:13.049
Howlihowlihowl!

12:13.070 --> 12:16.129
There. Now let's see the
howlibird get through that door.

12:16.149 --> 12:18.090
Howlihowl!

12:23.110 --> 12:26.019
Well, I knew he couldn't
get through the door.

12:28.049 --> 12:30.019
Howlihowl!

12:32.000 --> 12:33.110
[all clamoring]

12:34.220 --> 12:39.080
Hey, Howlibird,
here's a present for you.

12:39.100 --> 12:40.220
[laughing]

12:44.009 --> 12:47.070
Hey! You can't
do that to my present.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.039
boom

12:52.059 --> 12:54.049
That wasn't funny.

12:54.070 --> 12:55.149
Howlihowl!

12:55.169 --> 12:58.000
Smurf shelter in the forest.
Quickly.

12:58.019 --> 12:59.200
[all clamoring]

13:02.000 --> 13:04.139
Howlihowl!

13:08.100 --> 13:10.169
There's a safe place.

13:12.149 --> 13:14.190
[barks]

13:14.210 --> 13:17.230
Follow me. I know a place
where it will be safe.

13:18.009 --> 13:21.009
Howlihowlihowl!

13:21.029 --> 13:24.029
Howlihowl!

13:28.100 --> 13:30.210
Pull up your smurfs,
you featherheaded..

13:30.230 --> 13:33.139
Howlihowlihowl!

13:33.159 --> 13:36.049
Howlihowlihowli!

13:36.070 --> 13:38.220
Howlihowlihowli!

13:39.000 --> 13:41.100
[panting]
The Howlibird is
flying away, Papa Smurf.

13:41.120 --> 13:45.059
[panting]
Good. Now, we must call
the others to join us here.

13:48.169 --> 13:52.100
One, two, three, smurf.

13:52.120 --> 13:55.070
(all)
Yoo-hoo, Smurfs!

13:56.090 --> 13:58.009
[screeching]

13:59.100 --> 14:01.090
(Papa Smurf)
'Phew! It's only Feathers.'

14:01.110 --> 14:04.210
Why smurf! Feathers
could help us send a message.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.230
There. Good luck, Feathers.

14:09.009 --> 14:10.129
[screeching]

14:10.149 --> 14:13.100
(Papa Smurf)
'And watch out
for the Howlibird.'

14:13.120 --> 14:15.029
[instrumental music]

14:27.039 --> 14:29.210
Do you, d-do you see
the Howlibird, Smurfette?

14:29.230 --> 14:32.210
- I hate the Howlibird.
- Na, but I..

14:32.230 --> 14:34.100
[pounding]

14:34.120 --> 14:38.059
- Uh, wha-w-what's that?
- It's-it's the Howlibird.

14:38.080 --> 14:41.110
- I can feel it in my, my--
- In your heart?

14:41.129 --> 14:43.000
[heart pounding]

14:44.120 --> 14:47.080
[laughing]
I am not really scared.

14:47.100 --> 14:51.070
In fact, nothing
really scares me. I was..

14:51.090 --> 14:52.230
[screeching]

14:53.009 --> 14:54.220
Yipe! The Howlibird.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.149
The Howlibird!

14:56.169 --> 14:58.210
It's Feathers.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.070
Feathers?

15:00.090 --> 15:02.009
(Smurfette)
'What-what's that sign?'

15:02.029 --> 15:04.090
'"Smurfs come
to the old tower."'

15:04.110 --> 15:08.000
Of course, I knew all the time
it was Feathers and--

15:08.019 --> 15:10.139
It must be from Papa Smurf.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.169
We've got to find the other.

15:12.190 --> 15:14.149
Smurfs!

15:14.169 --> 15:16.059
What's it, Smurfette?

15:16.080 --> 15:18.149
[all clamoring]

15:18.169 --> 15:21.200
The old tower. Come on.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.200
I hate old towers.

15:23.220 --> 15:25.029
[instrumental music]

15:31.049 --> 15:34.009
Papa Smurf, here they come.

15:34.029 --> 15:36.039
But look what else is coming.

15:36.059 --> 15:38.049
Howlihowlihowli!

15:38.070 --> 15:39.149
(Papa Smurf)
'The Howlibird.'

15:39.169 --> 15:41.159
(Brainy)
We don't smurf a chance.

15:41.179 --> 15:45.100
[screeching]
Howlihowl!

15:45.120 --> 15:47.070
Smurf for your lives.

15:47.090 --> 15:50.000
Howlihowlihowli!

15:51.129 --> 15:54.179
Now, n-now, let's not b-be
hasty, Mr. Howlibird.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.029
Haste m-makes w-waste.

15:57.049 --> 15:58.230
Poor Brainy.

15:59.009 --> 16:01.019
Howlihowl!

16:01.039 --> 16:02.190
[Feathers screeching]

16:06.149 --> 16:08.159
Howlihowl!

16:08.179 --> 16:11.080
Howlihowlihowli!

16:12.029 --> 16:14.110
Howlihowlihowli!

16:18.169 --> 16:20.179
Hurray for Feathers.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.220
[all cheering]

16:23.000 --> 16:24.129
Save the cheering.

16:24.149 --> 16:27.070
Howlihowlihowl!

16:27.090 --> 16:29.029
Howlihowl!

16:30.070 --> 16:33.210
Howlihowlihowli!

16:33.230 --> 16:36.090
We must think of a way to get
rid of that Howlibird.

16:36.110 --> 16:38.009
I have an idea, Papa Smurf.

16:38.029 --> 16:40.129
We could fix up this
old crossbow and..

16:40.149 --> 16:42.029
[whispering]

16:42.049 --> 16:45.200
(Papa Smurf)
'Why, Smurf Handy,
that's not a bad idea.'

16:47.200 --> 16:50.230
(Howlibird)
'Howlihowlihowl!'

16:51.009 --> 16:52.200
[snoring]

16:56.129 --> 16:59.019
(Howlibird)
'Howlihowlihowli!'

16:59.039 --> 17:02.220
- There he is.
- Huh? What? Where? Who? When?

17:03.000 --> 17:06.140
Howlihowlihowl!

17:06.160 --> 17:10.108
That's it.
Ready. Aim. Fire!

17:14.160 --> 17:16.118
Howlihowl!

17:16.140 --> 17:18.079
Fire!

17:19.009 --> 17:20.220
[screeching]

17:21.000 --> 17:23.069
No, no, Clumsy,
this stone is too small.

17:23.089 --> 17:26.150
Papa Smurf says never
to leave a stone unturned.

17:26.170 --> 17:30.069
- Papa Smurf says--
- Fire!

17:30.089 --> 17:33.099
I'll tell Papa Smurf
on you, Hefty.

17:36.049 --> 17:38.049
Howlihowl!

17:39.049 --> 17:40.079
[all panting]

17:40.099 --> 17:42.099
We will have to smurf of
something else.

17:45.009 --> 17:48.230
Ah!
No, no, that won't smurf.

17:49.009 --> 17:51.029
(all)
Aw.

17:52.130 --> 17:54.000
I have..

17:55.019 --> 17:57.069
No, no, that's no good.

17:57.089 --> 17:59.019
(all)
Aw.

17:59.039 --> 18:00.059
I've got it.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.200
(all)
'He's got it.'

18:01.220 --> 18:05.079
Lazy, Hefty, do you remember
exactly where you threw

18:05.099 --> 18:06.180
that fertilizer potion?

18:06.200 --> 18:08.039
Sure, Papa Smurf.

18:08.059 --> 18:09.160
Good. Take me there.

18:09.180 --> 18:11.099
We'll leave after dark.

18:14.119 --> 18:15.160
[instrumental music]

18:24.029 --> 18:26.109
Be careful, Papa Smurf.

18:27.029 --> 18:28.190
[snoring]

18:34.009 --> 18:37.049
(Papa Smurf)
We have to be back before
the Howlibird wakens at dawn.

18:38.059 --> 18:39.160
[panting]

18:39.180 --> 18:41.079
Is it much further?

18:41.099 --> 18:43.170
(Hefty and Lazy)
Not far now.

18:44.059 --> 18:45.160
[panting]

18:45.180 --> 18:47.079
Is it much further?

18:47.099 --> 18:49.019
(Hefty and Lazy)
Not far now!

18:50.049 --> 18:51.150
[panting]

18:51.170 --> 18:53.130
Is it much further?

18:53.150 --> 18:55.079
(both)
Yes, it is!

18:57.160 --> 19:01.099
Ah, the bottle landed
about halfway down, Papa Smurf.

19:01.119 --> 19:04.009
Let's get to work.
It will be dawn soon.

19:08.079 --> 19:11.019
There's the fertilizer potion,
Papa Smurf.

19:16.059 --> 19:17.160
There's just enough left.

19:17.180 --> 19:19.230
What are you gonna do
with that stuff, Papa Smurf?

19:20.009 --> 19:22.130
I'm going to reverse the
properties of this potion

19:22.150 --> 19:25.230
and turn the Howlibird
back to normal.

19:26.009 --> 19:27.089
I hope.

19:29.140 --> 19:32.019
I don't think we're gonna
make it, Papa Smurf.

19:32.039 --> 19:34.119
Yeah, it's almost dawn.

19:34.140 --> 19:36.099
Then, run faster.

19:42.109 --> 19:44.160
Howlihowlihowl!

19:47.140 --> 19:49.170
Howlihowl!

19:49.190 --> 19:52.039
(Papa Smurf)
Almost there.
We're gonna make it. We are..

19:52.059 --> 19:54.029
(Howlibird)
'Howlihowl.'

19:54.049 --> 19:55.220
..not gonna make it.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.180
Howlihowl!

19:58.200 --> 20:02.230
(Lazy)
Ah, I think we just
brought the farm.

20:03.009 --> 20:05.039
(Howlibird)
'Howlihowlihowli!'

20:05.059 --> 20:09.089
Look at the bright side, Lazy.
You'll have eternal sleep.

20:09.109 --> 20:11.069
[screeching]

20:11.089 --> 20:15.089
Howlihowlihowli!
Howlihowlihowli!

20:16.089 --> 20:17.230
I'm sure I'm tired of this.

20:18.009 --> 20:20.089
Smurfs, open the window.

20:20.109 --> 20:22.119
[all clamoring]

20:23.119 --> 20:25.039
[Feathers screeching]

20:25.059 --> 20:27.079
Howlihowlihow..

20:30.009 --> 20:32.009
That was a little
too smurf for comfort.

20:32.029 --> 20:34.109
Yeah, I won't sleep
for a week.

20:34.130 --> 20:36.049
[rumble]

20:36.069 --> 20:39.029
Howlhowlihowl!

20:39.049 --> 20:42.140
Handy, is that little surprise
ready for the howlibird?

20:42.160 --> 20:43.190
All ready, Papa Smurf.

20:43.210 --> 20:45.140
Then smurf out the catapult

20:45.160 --> 20:48.000
while I reverse this
fertilizer potion.

20:49.170 --> 20:51.130
- 'Howlihowl!'
- Here he comes.

20:51.150 --> 20:54.190
Ready. Fire.

20:54.210 --> 20:57.059
Howlihowlihowli!

21:00.190 --> 21:02.119
[screeching]

21:05.119 --> 21:07.019
(Lazy)
'Yippee! We got it.'

21:07.039 --> 21:09.019
(Hefty)
'Down with the Howlibird.'

21:09.039 --> 21:10.200
[all cheering]

21:14.109 --> 21:18.019
Now, what do we do with that
nasty old Howlibird, Papa Smurf.

21:18.039 --> 21:20.200
I'll feed him this reverse
fertilizer potion.

21:20.220 --> 21:22.099
Keep your smurfs crossed.

21:22.119 --> 21:26.000
Hefty, when I say the word
give the Howlibird a good kick

21:26.019 --> 21:27.170
'in the you know what.'

21:27.190 --> 21:31.019
'Greedy, untie its beak.
Ready?'

21:31.039 --> 21:33.099
Smurf it, Hefty.

21:33.119 --> 21:34.160
ding

21:34.180 --> 21:36.019
[screeching]

21:43.019 --> 21:44.170
[screeching]

21:45.170 --> 21:48.039
[laughter]

21:50.000 --> 21:52.119
[instrumental music]

21:56.019 --> 21:57.200
[snoring]

22:04.180 --> 22:07.019
(Howlibird)
'Howlihowlihowl!'

22:07.039 --> 22:09.140
Huh? What? Who? When? Why?

22:09.160 --> 22:12.140
Howlihowlihowlihowl!

22:12.160 --> 22:13.220
Yeah, yeah, I heard you.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.029
Go smurf someone else,
will you. I'm busy.

22:19.200 --> 22:22.210
[snoring]

22:22.230 --> 22:26.130
So Papa Smurf reversed the
potion and shrank the Howlibird

22:26.150 --> 22:27.200
back to normal size

22:27.220 --> 22:30.200
a brilliant idea,
of course, and..

22:30.220 --> 22:33.029
Howlihowlihowl!

22:33.049 --> 22:35.019
So we won't have
anymore headaches

22:35.039 --> 22:37.000
from the Howlibird and..

22:37.019 --> 22:39.029
Ouch.

22:39.049 --> 22:42.029
Howlihowlihowlihowl!

22:42.049 --> 22:46.059
Don't you know a falling stone
gathers no moss.

22:46.079 --> 22:48.130
[blowing off-key]

22:53.119 --> 22:56.009
[blowing off-key]

23:05.039 --> 23:08.190

Howlihowl!

23:10.019 --> 23:12.099
