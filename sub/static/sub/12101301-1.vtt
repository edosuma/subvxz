00:50.217 --> 00:52.052
-

01:56.325 --> 01:57.743
GREER:
Agent Ritter.

01:57.827 --> 02:00.704
What’s the CIA got for us today?

02:00.788 --> 02:02.122
Lieutenant Commander.

02:02.206 --> 02:04.291
Sun’s going down.
We should get to it.

02:10.506 --> 02:12.800
RITTER:
The hostage is a CIA operative.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.552
We believe he is being held

02:14.635 --> 02:16.762
by Syrian government forces
in a nearby building.

02:16.846 --> 02:19.223
Call sign is "Randy."
We approach from the south.

02:19.306 --> 02:22.643
We should expect eyes on us
here and here.

02:22.726 --> 02:26.105
GREER: How many Syrian troops
are we talking about?

02:26.188 --> 02:28.107
I don’t have that information.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.651
Well, that was a good talk.

02:33.028 --> 02:34.989
-You a comedian? Is that it?
-WEBB: No, no, no.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.074
He’s just a bit of a smart-ass.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.659
No, that’s not right.
I’m the smart-ass.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.327
Yeah, he’s, uh...
he’s more of a badass.

02:40.411 --> 02:42.204
-Oh.
-Yeah.

02:42.288 --> 02:43.873
RITTER:
Let’s move.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.892
-

03:07.938 --> 03:10.357
GREER:
Three, two, one.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.779
-

03:18.991 --> 03:21.619
-

03:32.922 --> 03:35.007
-

03:35.090 --> 03:37.259
-

03:40.012 --> 03:41.931
Clear!

03:47.186 --> 03:48.687
Hostage identity confirmed.

03:48.771 --> 03:50.564
It’s him.

03:50.648 --> 03:51.815
Let’s move.

03:53.317 --> 03:54.818
-What the hell is this, Ritter?
-WEBB: I got you, man.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.904
These are ex-Russian military.

03:56.987 --> 04:00.074
You said Syrian army,
not Russians.

04:01.492 --> 04:03.410
I don’t see any Russians.

04:04.536 --> 04:07.081
Okay, what are we waiting for?
Let’s go.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.963
Let’s move.

04:18.550 --> 04:19.885
JOHN:
RPG!

04:19.969 --> 04:21.345
-Get back!
-Take cover!

04:50.749 --> 04:52.209
Greer!

04:59.508 --> 05:01.343
We got a man down.
We need an extraction.

05:01.427 --> 05:03.679
Priority is
securing the hostage.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.806
We rendezvous at the exfil.
Let’s move!

05:09.059 --> 05:10.978
Hang on!

05:11.061 --> 05:14.106
-

05:16.900 --> 05:18.235
Team member Russell is dead!

05:18.318 --> 05:19.570
Move him to the exfil!

05:28.912 --> 05:31.665
-

05:35.794 --> 05:38.213
-

05:43.761 --> 05:47.097
PMCs, Russian transpo.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.390
Ritter lied.

05:48.474 --> 05:49.808
This isn’t a safe house.

05:49.892 --> 05:51.769
It’s a Russian arms depot.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.353
Yeah, no shit.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.189
Fire in the hole.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.860
On me.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.570
Got your back.

06:25.219 --> 06:26.845
-

07:04.424 --> 07:07.261
GREER:
Ritter, explain the Russians!

07:07.344 --> 07:09.847
They weren’t just contractors.
They were Russian military.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.311
But you knew that, didn’t you?

07:26.822 --> 07:28.448
MAN
Confirm target.

07:28.532 --> 07:30.701
Eagle Six.
Yes, target is confirmed.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.911
Need an air strike at grid

07:32.995 --> 07:36.373
November Papa six seven
five two niner zero.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.334
I should’ve been fully briefed.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.211
The Russians killed
one of my men.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.005
Well, that’s the job,
sweetheart.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.048
-Yeah, bullshit.
-

07:45.132 --> 07:47.384
Stand down.
Do it, Senior Chief.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.428
-Now.
-RITTER: What are you doing?

07:51.763 --> 07:53.599
Attaboy!

08:26.965 --> 08:29.760
You want to hear
something romantic?

08:29.843 --> 08:32.596
Yeah? What’s that?

08:32.679 --> 08:34.306
This isn’t your baby.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.895
Oh, you cold-blooded.

08:39.978 --> 08:43.774
Listen, you gonna park your butt
right over here on this couch.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.484
Cold.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.319
-You crazy.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.446
-Uh, no, it’s all good.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.448
I’ll go get something for you.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.659
Okay.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.077
Want some water?

08:55.160 --> 08:57.537
Uh, I want some wine.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.539
Okay, I’ll take an iced tea.

08:59.623 --> 09:01.083
Okay, that’s better.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.793
With some sugar.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.586
I got you.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.676
Yeah, they need that,
but we also got to figure out

09:10.759 --> 09:12.135
why they acting out so much.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.012
We got to, like,
help these teachers out

09:14.096 --> 09:15.514
-in the public schools.
-Mm-hmm.

09:15.597 --> 09:16.723
-Hey.
-Oh, babe, I was just about

09:16.807 --> 09:18.225
-to bring it to you.
-No, no, that’s okay.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.977
Sister Easton was
talking my ear off,

09:20.060 --> 09:21.895
so it’s safer in here.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.313
-Yeah, that’s facts.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.564
WEST:
She got you, didn’t she?

09:25.774 --> 09:27.150
Pam’s been telling us
you got yourself

09:27.234 --> 09:28.360
a fancy new job, right?

09:28.443 --> 09:30.404
Well, no, he’s been
offered the job.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.281
-He hasn’t taken it yet.
-Oh.

09:32.364 --> 09:34.324
It’s, uh...
it’s private security.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.410
Good hours, good pay.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.496
Mm-hmm.

09:39.579 --> 09:43.208
Well, it’s a big step,
retiring from the military.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.087
-When are you due again?
-Oh.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.214
-Next month, the 17th.
-Oh, next month, the 17th.

09:49.298 --> 09:51.133
Oh, man, I remember
when we had our first.

09:51.216 --> 09:54.011
Oh, my God, you think combat
keeps you up at night,

09:54.094 --> 09:56.388
you just wait till
that little joker gets hungry.

09:59.016 --> 10:00.642
He gonna dropkick you.

10:00.726 --> 10:03.395
It’s a girl.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.439
A girl.
Oh, now you’re in trouble.

10:11.862 --> 10:14.197
-

10:14.281 --> 10:16.700
-One of these?
-WOMAN: Finished?

10:16.783 --> 10:19.077
Babe, could you help me
take out the garbage, please?

10:19.161 --> 10:20.954
-Yes.
-Yeah, sure.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.544
Daddy, you said
you’d play Twister!

10:27.627 --> 10:30.047
All right, all right,
just give me a second.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.132
-

11:07.501 --> 11:09.419
You remember this night?

11:09.503 --> 11:11.421
Yeah, I remember
that dress and them shoes.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.466
I remember your hair.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.178
-

11:20.514 --> 11:23.058
I am on my way.
I just got stuck in a...

11:23.141 --> 11:25.310
Jesus, man, come on!

11:25.394 --> 11:27.229
WOMAN
Where are you coming from?

11:27.312 --> 11:29.398
Um...

11:29.481 --> 11:31.775
I was at Happy’s
with some of the boys.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.277
Another boys’ night
with your Navy SEALs?

11:34.361 --> 11:36.071
Babe, please, don’t start.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.990
What the...?

11:40.117 --> 11:42.035
Baby? Hello?

11:42.119 --> 11:43.829
Hello?

11:46.289 --> 11:48.250
What happened?

11:48.333 --> 11:49.918
JOHN:
How’s my girl?

11:50.001 --> 11:52.087
Pregnant.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.339
You should try it.

11:54.423 --> 11:58.051
-Oh, actually, I was
talking about my other girl.

11:58.135 --> 12:00.137
-Oh. Excuse me.
-Mm-hmm.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.180
So, what, you doing good, baby?

12:02.264 --> 12:04.307
Daddy can’t wait
for you to get here.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.018
We got your room all picked out.

12:07.102 --> 12:09.229
Yeah, wait. What was that?

12:09.312 --> 12:11.731
Oh. She says she’s gonna be
a daddy’s girl.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.775
-Oh, God, I doubt it.
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

12:13.859 --> 12:15.652
It’s two against one.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.446
You know what? I surrender.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.364
I know when I’m outnumbered.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.584
Now, you know...

12:32.085 --> 12:34.796
...how much it turns me on
when you wear my socks, right?

12:34.880 --> 12:36.381
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

12:36.465 --> 12:37.674
And you got ’em on.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.384
-Mm-mm.
-Mm-hmm.

12:39.468 --> 12:41.928
John, no, I really need
to go to sleep tonight.

12:42.012 --> 12:43.930
No, I know, you...
you can go to sleep.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.557
-No.
-I just... It’s gonna be quick.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.058
-It’ll be quick. I promise.
-No.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.518
Mm, stop.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.645
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

12:50.729 --> 12:53.148
Goodbye.

12:53.231 --> 12:56.193
And don’t stay downstairs
all night listening to music.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.028
I promise.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.956
fade away

13:35.273 --> 13:37.609
but was on the plate

13:37.692 --> 13:40.445
I ain’t like the taste

13:40.529 --> 13:44.074
up out of last week

13:44.157 --> 13:46.660
to harass me

13:46.743 --> 13:48.745
you good lover

13:48.828 --> 13:51.623
we already blood

14:04.719 --> 14:08.974
don’t cut me loose

14:15.438 --> 14:17.107
-

15:49.866 --> 15:51.493
I’m ready.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.128
-

16:57.183 --> 17:00.395
-

17:40.143 --> 17:41.686
Pam.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.652
Pam.

17:52.489 --> 17:54.282
Baby?

18:02.791 --> 18:04.417
Pam.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.047
No.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.216
No. No.

18:51.506 --> 18:54.050
What we know is
three perps are dead

18:54.133 --> 18:56.094
and Senior Chief Kelly
is in critical condition,

18:56.177 --> 18:57.971
isn’t likely to pull through.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.348
Also killed was his wife.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.767
Uh, Kelly is the third member
of the Special Operations unit

19:02.851 --> 19:05.228
to be attacked
in the last 24 hours.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.814
FBI has provided the remaining
team members and their families

19:07.897 --> 19:10.733
access to security
and protective custody.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.569
We have to be alert
to the fact that

19:12.652 --> 19:14.445
these SEALs get themselves
into all worlds of trouble.

19:14.529 --> 19:16.781
Drugs, arms, information.

19:16.865 --> 19:18.783
And keeping that in mind,
we are taking

19:18.867 --> 19:21.995
every possible scenario
into consideration.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.913
-Yes. -That’s all that matters.
-GREER: Ritter!

19:23.997 --> 19:25.582
What the hell was that

19:25.665 --> 19:28.167
"every possible scenario"
bullshit in there?

19:28.251 --> 19:30.545
My men were not dirty,
and you know it.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.173
What is the whole story?

19:34.257 --> 19:35.842
And don’t bullshit me, Ritter.

19:35.925 --> 19:38.011
Today is not the day for it.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.264
We’re looking into it.

19:43.308 --> 19:47.478
How come both times
my world has gone to shit,

19:47.562 --> 19:49.856
you’re standing
in the middle of it?

19:53.359 --> 19:55.361
Just good luck, I guess.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.656
I need a doctor!

20:39.739 --> 20:41.950
Code blue!

20:42.033 --> 20:43.868
-Check his pulse.
-BP’s dropping.

20:43.952 --> 20:46.204
-Start chest compressions.
-I got you.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.937
The baby.

21:43.386 --> 21:45.388
Know who’s behind it?

21:49.142 --> 21:50.893
I don’t know.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.899
Pros.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.111
They were pros.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.619
The guy they found
in my bedroom...

22:11.289 --> 22:13.291
I didn’t kill him.

22:16.627 --> 22:19.213
He was already dead
when I got there.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.889
One got away.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.562
All I need...

22:37.273 --> 22:39.275
...is a name.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.655
Give me a name.

22:48.659 --> 22:50.661
Even if I knew...

22:54.248 --> 22:56.250
...you know I can’t do that.

23:12.558 --> 23:15.770
Which part of "please knock"
wasn’t clear?

23:18.648 --> 23:20.900
Excuse me, Mr. Secretary.

23:20.983 --> 23:22.318
My apologies, sir.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.445
No need.

23:24.529 --> 23:26.906
I would’ve been disappointed
with anything less.

23:31.244 --> 23:32.787
Special assignment to the DoD.

23:32.870 --> 23:34.288
It’s impressive.

23:36.833 --> 23:38.918
You even got a window.

23:39.001 --> 23:40.795
Please.

23:43.047 --> 23:46.008
I did some work with your uncle.

23:46.092 --> 23:49.137
Jim Greer is
one hell of an operative.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.055
If you say so, sir.

23:53.349 --> 23:56.811
He speaks very highly of you
and your judgment.

23:58.146 --> 24:01.691
Which is why I would like
to talk to you about John Kelly.

24:04.402 --> 24:07.822
Lieutenant Commander,
in your opinion,

24:07.905 --> 24:10.741
how far can Kelly be trusted?

24:16.247 --> 24:18.249
GUTIERREZ:
You know the drill.

24:19.834 --> 24:22.253
Chest press to 15.
Let’s go.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.830
CLAY:
Lieutenant Commander, come in.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.001
RITTER:
Uh...

25:02.084 --> 25:04.921
Mr. Secretary, all due respect,
the director made it clear

25:05.004 --> 25:07.381
I was to brief you and you only.

25:07.465 --> 25:09.008
CLAY:
Hmm.

25:09.091 --> 25:10.551
Take a seat.

25:10.635 --> 25:12.345
I asked the CIA to brief me

25:12.428 --> 25:14.347
on the situation
relating to your men.

25:14.430 --> 25:15.890
I thought you’d like
to be present.

25:15.973 --> 25:17.475
Thank you, sir.

25:23.397 --> 25:25.024
Yuri Zelin.

25:25.107 --> 25:27.276
Son of Nikolay Zelin,
head of the FSB.

25:29.445 --> 25:33.491
This is Yuri in Aleppo
an hour before our assault.

25:33.574 --> 25:36.285
Lieutenant Commander’s team
killed him on the second floor.

25:37.495 --> 25:39.121
Now, what he was doing there,
we don’t know,

25:39.205 --> 25:43.292
but Webb, Rowdy and Kelly
all seem to have been payback.

25:43.376 --> 25:47.213
All the men Kelly killed
in his house had FSB links.

25:48.339 --> 25:51.008
CLAY:
So you are actually telling me

25:51.092 --> 25:53.886
the massacres of our men
and their families

25:53.970 --> 25:56.305
were foreign attacks
on U.S. soil.

25:56.389 --> 25:58.683
Russians.

25:58.766 --> 26:01.435
By proxy.

26:01.519 --> 26:05.022
None of them were connected to
Russia in an official capacity.

26:05.106 --> 26:06.565
Did you know Russia
was dealing weapons

26:06.649 --> 26:08.818
out of Aleppo when we went in?

26:08.901 --> 26:10.945
Oh, we had a feeling.

26:13.614 --> 26:16.450
We’re a man short.

26:16.534 --> 26:19.287
Kelly said one of
the Russians got away.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.330
There’s three men here.
Where’s the fourth?

26:21.414 --> 26:23.332
Uh, it doesn’t matter.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.628
The CIA’s position on this
moving forward

26:27.712 --> 26:29.338
is that the matter is closed.

26:29.422 --> 26:31.507
What?

26:31.590 --> 26:34.635
The director considers
the score even.

26:34.719 --> 26:36.971
She feels, uh,

26:37.054 --> 26:39.473
it’s unnecessary
to poke the bear any further.

26:46.230 --> 26:48.399
If Sarah believes
there’s not enough intel

26:48.482 --> 26:51.110
for me to generate a response,
my hands are tied.

26:51.193 --> 26:53.195
For now.

27:00.494 --> 27:02.496
Get your mug.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.146
We celebrating something?

27:27.229 --> 27:28.898
Drink.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.155
That’s an order.

27:49.627 --> 27:51.545
I finally understand
how you felt

27:51.629 --> 27:53.839
on that helicopter in Syria.

27:53.923 --> 27:55.800
About Ritter.

27:58.135 --> 28:00.805
CIA doesn’t support
any further investigation

28:00.888 --> 28:04.016
into the attacks
or Pam’s murder.

28:06.602 --> 28:08.521
Came straight from
the director’s office.

28:08.604 --> 28:12.108
They’re calling it
national security.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.818
They know it was
Russian nationals, and...

28:13.901 --> 28:15.528
JOHN:
Jesus.

28:15.611 --> 28:18.614
...it’s just a file on a
classified server somewhere now.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.707
Shit.

28:31.377 --> 28:34.130
Probably gonna go
to jail for this.

28:35.756 --> 28:37.508
But hey.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.263
These are your toe tags.

28:47.184 --> 28:49.854
I got ’em from Secretary Clay.

28:52.314 --> 28:55.234
-Where’s the fourth?
-Your survivor’s a ghost.

28:55.317 --> 28:59.071
But these three were cleared
by the chief of intel.

29:00.114 --> 29:02.533
Andre Vaseliev, ex-FSB.

29:02.616 --> 29:04.702
He’s the one
who issued their passports.

29:04.785 --> 29:07.621
JOHN:
Vaseliev.

29:07.705 --> 29:10.541
He’ll know
who the fourth man is.

29:11.959 --> 29:14.879
-Anybody talk to him yet?
-Nope.

29:14.962 --> 29:17.965
He’s full-on untouchable.

32:16.769 --> 32:18.646
-MAN: Watch out there. Whoa.
-

32:18.729 --> 32:20.147
What are you doing, man?
Come on.

32:20.230 --> 32:22.650
Hey. You watch out.

32:22.733 --> 32:24.777
-JOHN: Hey, you.
-That your brother?

32:24.860 --> 32:27.571
-JOHN: What? What?
-Blow me.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.703
Hey. Hey.

32:34.787 --> 32:36.372
-You got to get out of here.
-Look, I-I got... I got...

32:36.455 --> 32:37.790
-I got a jacket, too. Look.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:37.873 --> 32:39.124
-I-I just...
-Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

32:39.208 --> 32:40.709
-I just want to show you
my jacket. -No, no, no, no.

32:40.793 --> 32:41.919
-You guys...
-You got to keep it moving.

32:42.002 --> 32:43.170
Can we trade?
Can we trade jackets?

32:43.253 --> 32:44.338
No. Back up. Back up.

32:44.421 --> 32:45.839
I get it. I get it.
I just need to go...

32:45.923 --> 32:47.549
-No. Get back. Take a step...
-Get by.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.176
-I got to get through.
-No, you don’t. No, you don’t.

32:49.259 --> 32:50.886
-You need to go this way.
-I got to go that way.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.513
-No, you don’t.
You need to step... -I-I...

32:52.596 --> 32:55.057
-Okay, okay. All right, okay.
-I told you, get back!

32:55.140 --> 32:57.434
Okay, okay.

33:01.230 --> 33:04.149
I just need to go...

33:25.546 --> 33:27.840
OPERATOR: 911. What’s the nature
of your emergency?

33:27.923 --> 33:30.509
Hey, I’m dropping off somebody
at Dulles Airport,

33:30.592 --> 33:32.928
and I see a car swerving
in and out of the lanes.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.013
I pulled up next to him,
and, um,

33:35.097 --> 33:36.640
I hate to be this guy,

33:36.724 --> 33:38.559
but I’m pretty sure
he flashed a gun at me.

33:38.642 --> 33:40.018
Dark SUV.

33:40.102 --> 33:42.813
License plate
R-T-five-six-two-nine.

33:42.896 --> 33:45.482
Hurry up.
I’m-I’m really scared.

34:10.883 --> 34:14.928
Why does it take so much time
to get rid of the police?

34:16.472 --> 34:20.601
Don’t worry, Mr. Vaseliev.
I’ll get you to the gate.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.980
-

34:32.613 --> 34:34.490
-

34:42.831 --> 34:44.666
-

35:06.104 --> 35:07.606
Yeah, you remember me? Huh?

35:07.689 --> 35:09.024
Who killed my wife? Huh?

35:09.107 --> 35:10.692
Who was the fourth guy
at my house?

35:10.776 --> 35:12.236
-Give me a name.

35:12.319 --> 35:14.613
-

35:14.696 --> 35:17.366
You give me a name.

35:21.245 --> 35:23.080
Okay.

35:23.163 --> 35:25.082
I’ll give you a name.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.210
John Kelly.

35:29.503 --> 35:32.464
You are the problem, John.

35:32.548 --> 35:34.174
You’re supposed to be dead,

35:34.258 --> 35:36.176
so wherever you go,
death will follow.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.637
-

35:38.720 --> 35:40.097
Yeah.

35:40.180 --> 35:41.723
Yeah, I punctured your lung.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.101
My wife Pam,
she drowned in her own blood.

35:44.184 --> 35:45.978
Now, you give me a name.

35:46.061 --> 35:47.813
Give me a name,
and I’ll make it quick.

35:47.896 --> 35:50.482
-

35:50.566 --> 35:52.568
Viktor Rykov.

35:54.486 --> 35:55.654
-He’s exiting the vehicle!

35:55.737 --> 35:57.281
Get down!
Hands where we can see ’em!

35:57.364 --> 35:58.740
-Let us see your hands!
-Get down!

35:58.824 --> 36:00.284
-I’m military!
-Turn around.

36:00.367 --> 36:01.785
-Hands up!
-Don’t shoot! I’m military!

36:01.869 --> 36:03.287
Get your hands behind your head!

36:03.370 --> 36:06.290
REPORTER: Literally hours
before the Dulles attack,

36:06.373 --> 36:08.709
an anonymous source releases
classified documents

36:08.792 --> 36:11.044
that tie the Russian government
to the attacks

36:11.128 --> 36:14.172
on our Navy SEALs
here in the U.S.,

36:14.256 --> 36:16.675
and you’re telling me
that’s coincidental?

36:16.758 --> 36:18.844
I’m saying I’d be wary
about accusing

36:18.927 --> 36:21.305
the Russian state
of assassinating

36:21.388 --> 36:23.515
U.S. service members
on American soil.

36:27.352 --> 36:29.271
RITTER: We didn’t leak
the Russian thing.

36:29.354 --> 36:30.814
I mean, why would we?

36:30.898 --> 36:32.733
We were the ones
trying to cover it up.

36:36.653 --> 36:38.405
And as a courtesy,
Director Dillard thought

36:38.488 --> 36:41.116
you might want to know
how Kelly got to Vaseliev.

36:42.993 --> 36:44.661
Lieutenant Commander Greer?

36:44.745 --> 36:46.246
Yeah, we can’t prove it.

36:46.330 --> 36:49.625
Although, as I recall,
you were quite insistent

36:49.708 --> 36:51.919
that she be briefed
on the matter.

36:52.961 --> 36:55.130
She did seem resourceful.

36:57.591 --> 37:00.344
There is the obvious concern
that this new development

37:00.427 --> 37:02.512
sends the wrong message
to Moscow.

37:02.596 --> 37:04.264
The wrong message?

37:06.266 --> 37:08.477
They hit us at home.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.604
Now they’re paying attention.

37:10.687 --> 37:13.440
And Kelly has
a big target on his back.

37:13.523 --> 37:16.401
Even in prison,
he won’t be safe.

37:16.485 --> 37:20.697
Some situations warrant
thinking outside the box.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.622
Has it occurred to you
that John Kelly

37:28.705 --> 37:31.458
perhaps has done
something we can’t?

37:32.626 --> 37:34.753
He shook a tree
that needed shaking.

37:34.836 --> 37:36.088
So...

37:37.130 --> 37:39.132
...let’s see who else falls out.

37:40.133 --> 37:43.220
You’re pretty messy right now.

37:43.303 --> 37:45.806
In more ways than one.

37:45.889 --> 37:47.891
No, I’m not.

37:50.102 --> 37:52.688
I spent half my life
playing that game.

37:55.482 --> 37:58.318
I’m the one that went to hell
and did their dirty work.

37:59.987 --> 38:02.864
We served a country
that didn’t love us back.

38:04.324 --> 38:07.285
Because we believed
in what it could be.

38:07.369 --> 38:10.414
We fought for what
America could be.

38:12.082 --> 38:14.084
But they crossed a line.

38:15.419 --> 38:17.963
They brought their war
into my house.

38:21.508 --> 38:23.510
They took my wife.

38:27.556 --> 38:29.099
And they took my baby girl

38:29.182 --> 38:31.393
before she got a chance
to take a breath.

38:35.188 --> 38:37.524
That contract is broken.

38:39.151 --> 38:41.153
They’re gonna play
by my rules now.

38:42.946 --> 38:46.158
I’ll show them
what a pawn can do to a king.

38:50.746 --> 38:52.748
The files you got
on those Russians,

38:52.831 --> 38:55.709
Secretary Clay gave it
to you, right?

38:55.792 --> 38:57.627
I need you to get
a message to him.

39:00.005 --> 39:02.007
That’s impossible, John.

39:03.383 --> 39:05.677
But I found out something.

39:07.929 --> 39:09.973
What do you have?

39:10.057 --> 39:11.683
No.

39:11.767 --> 39:13.310
If he wants to know what I know,

39:13.393 --> 39:15.937
then you got to get me
out of here, and fast.

39:17.731 --> 39:20.942
Why do you think I ended up
in a prison full of Russian mob?

39:21.026 --> 39:22.903
-Think about it.
-

39:27.657 --> 39:29.743
They can get to me in here.

40:44.192 --> 40:46.069
On your feet.

40:46.153 --> 40:48.446
Turn around and face the wall.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.409
Now, why would I do that?

40:52.492 --> 40:55.287
I’m taking you on a little trip.

40:55.370 --> 40:58.707
Nah, I’m good right here.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.960
Stand up and face the wall.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.631
If you can’t tell me
where I’m going,

41:06.715 --> 41:08.717
I’m not moving.

42:20.664 --> 42:22.499
-Go, go, go, go!
-Move, move!

42:46.606 --> 42:48.400
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-JOHN: Close the door,

42:48.483 --> 42:50.026
or I’m-a start snapping necks!

43:08.545 --> 43:10.213
Make a hole.

43:10.297 --> 43:13.008
Ma’am, approaching John now.

43:20.140 --> 43:22.559
Senior Chief Kelly.

43:22.642 --> 43:25.520
I’m United States Marshal
Kevin Townsend.

43:26.771 --> 43:29.190
I’m gonna slide a phone
through your hatch.

43:29.274 --> 43:31.359
Somebody would like
to talk to you.

43:31.443 --> 43:33.153
JOHN:
Drop it in.

43:37.115 --> 43:38.575
This is John.

43:38.658 --> 43:40.827
GREER:
John, it’s me.

43:40.910 --> 43:42.746
We’re getting you out of there.

43:42.829 --> 43:44.622
Follow the U.S. Marshal.

43:44.706 --> 43:46.166
You can trust him.

43:49.544 --> 43:51.713
Unless you’re not done.

43:53.256 --> 43:55.050
I’m done.

44:09.647 --> 44:12.650
You know you messed up
when they send a motorcade.

44:13.860 --> 44:16.196
Buddy, they’re gonna write songs

44:16.279 --> 44:18.323
about all the shit
you messed up.

44:45.809 --> 44:47.227
This way.

44:57.946 --> 44:59.697
GREER:
Mr. Secretary.

44:59.781 --> 45:01.408
Senior Chief John Kelly.

45:01.491 --> 45:03.118
John.

45:04.536 --> 45:07.205
Have you met Sarah Dillard?
She runs the CIA.

45:08.706 --> 45:10.583
And Robert Ritter,
also from the C...

45:10.667 --> 45:12.502
I know him.

45:14.087 --> 45:16.798
So, what have you learned?

45:16.881 --> 45:19.259
Make our trip down here
worthwhile.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.722
Viktor Rykov.

45:29.727 --> 45:32.021
How do you know that name?

45:32.105 --> 45:35.442
He was the fourth gunman
at my house.

45:35.525 --> 45:37.277
He killed my wife.

45:37.360 --> 45:39.571
Viktor Rykov is dead.

45:39.654 --> 45:41.364
Who the hell is Viktor Rykov?

45:43.408 --> 45:45.827
He’s classified.

45:45.910 --> 45:47.787
Tell the man.

45:51.708 --> 45:53.793
Viktor Anatoly Rykov.

45:53.877 --> 45:55.837
Born in Tyumen.
Parents died early.

45:55.920 --> 45:58.506
Moved to the U.S.
as a young child for a time.

45:58.590 --> 46:00.383
Suspected Russian
special forces.

46:00.467 --> 46:03.678
Counterespionage, FSB, weapons.

46:03.761 --> 46:05.472
His ideology was post-Soviet.

46:05.555 --> 46:07.098
He believed the West
could be brought down

46:07.182 --> 46:09.392
by a series of strategic attacks
on American soil.

46:09.476 --> 46:12.562
He was a planner and a doer.

46:12.645 --> 46:15.690
He had an established set
of embedded agents.

46:15.773 --> 46:18.693
That is, until we, uh...

46:18.776 --> 46:20.361
sanctioned him.

46:20.445 --> 46:22.530
CLAY:
Or thought we sanctioned him.

46:24.949 --> 46:26.868
Tran.

46:26.951 --> 46:28.369
Can you reassure us

46:28.453 --> 46:29.913
that Mr. Kelly
wouldn’t know Mr. Rykov

46:29.996 --> 46:31.664
if he was standing
in front of him?

46:31.748 --> 46:33.583
Put him in a lineup, please.

46:40.006 --> 46:41.841
Top right.

46:43.343 --> 46:45.720
Yeah, that’s him.

46:56.272 --> 47:00.109
If it is him, what do we do?

47:00.193 --> 47:04.239
If Rykov is alive, we need
to find him and bring him in.

47:04.322 --> 47:06.324
We know his M.O.

47:06.407 --> 47:08.618
We have to assume that
this operation is not a one-off.

47:08.701 --> 47:10.203
Think about it.

47:11.788 --> 47:13.706
And, uh,

47:13.790 --> 47:16.000
if I had to guess, he’s probably
staged out of Russia.

47:16.084 --> 47:18.086
I need to be on that team.

47:18.169 --> 47:20.296
CLAY:
Thank you, John, sincerely,

47:20.380 --> 47:23.132
but we’ll take it from here.

47:23.216 --> 47:25.635
Lieutenant Commander,
you’ll head the mission.

47:25.718 --> 47:28.263
You’ll be making an extraction.

47:28.346 --> 47:31.057
-I suggest you prepare a list.
-JOHN: No, no.

47:32.517 --> 47:34.060
I think I’ve shown
that I’m willing to go

47:34.143 --> 47:37.605
further than anyone
to get the job done.

47:37.689 --> 47:40.233
Consider what I did in Dulles
as an audition.

47:42.694 --> 47:46.447
Sir, if this guy’s
as bad as he says he is,

47:46.531 --> 47:49.033
then you need somebody like me.

47:49.117 --> 47:50.994
And there’s nobody like me.

47:51.077 --> 47:54.497
GREER: I don’t think
that would be optimal, sir.

47:54.581 --> 47:56.916
It is my opinion
that Senior Chief Kelly is not

47:57.000 --> 47:59.836
in the right state of mind
to be in the field right now.

48:06.509 --> 48:09.095
With all due respect,

48:09.178 --> 48:11.681
I think he’s perfectly suited.

48:14.976 --> 48:17.186
He goes, too.

48:20.982 --> 48:23.026
But after the mission,
you will return

48:23.109 --> 48:26.112
to the penitentiary as a felon.

48:30.867 --> 48:33.453
JOHN: Never jumped from
a passenger jet before.

48:33.536 --> 48:34.871
PILOT:
It’s modified.

48:34.954 --> 48:37.248
You’ll jump out
of the cargo door.

48:37.332 --> 48:39.250
But backstopping
an unplanned flight

48:39.334 --> 48:41.669
over Germany to Russia
takes time.

48:41.753 --> 48:44.130
The route from Leipzig
to Anchorage is already cleared.

48:44.213 --> 48:45.548
Goes right over the DZ.

48:45.632 --> 48:47.050
-I’ll see you guys later.
-Copy that.

48:49.302 --> 48:52.305
So, this Rykov’s hiding
in Murmansk?

48:52.388 --> 48:55.892
No bullshit, I thought
this was an exercise.

48:55.975 --> 48:58.353
We’re flying civilian?

48:58.436 --> 48:59.979
Given the heightened tension
with Russia,

49:00.063 --> 49:01.689
it’s the cleanest plan.

49:01.773 --> 49:04.067
And we cannot leave a trace
of U.S. presence behind.

49:04.150 --> 49:05.693
Understood?

49:05.777 --> 49:07.570
What’s our exfil?

49:09.072 --> 49:11.866
You should read
the mission brief.

49:11.949 --> 49:13.868
Hey, Ritter,
you’re not joining us?

49:13.951 --> 49:15.953
RITTER:
I’ll see you over there.

49:33.346 --> 49:35.098
Stop.

49:35.181 --> 49:36.516
JOHN:
Hmm?

49:36.599 --> 49:38.184
Don’t do that, John.

49:38.267 --> 49:39.727
I’m serious.

49:39.811 --> 49:41.354
Mm. Okay.

49:41.437 --> 49:43.022
Okay.

49:43.106 --> 49:44.440
Okay, I’m sorry.

49:44.524 --> 49:45.733
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

49:45.817 --> 49:47.819
Why are you such an asshole?

49:51.364 --> 49:54.575
"I don’t think Senior Chief
Kelly’s fit for the field."

49:55.952 --> 49:57.412
Hmm?

49:57.495 --> 49:59.288
What was that?

50:00.373 --> 50:02.291
You don’t trust me no more?

50:02.375 --> 50:06.379
Like I said,
you’re pretty messy right now.

50:16.264 --> 50:18.182
Before I put a bullet
in Vaseliev’s head,

50:18.266 --> 50:20.268
you know what he told me?

50:22.103 --> 50:24.522
That death follows me around.

50:26.774 --> 50:28.526
-He was right.
-John, he was...

50:28.609 --> 50:30.987
No, no, no, no,
just hear me out.

50:33.114 --> 50:36.784
If I hadn’t been
on that mission in Aleppo,

50:36.868 --> 50:40.121
if I would’ve pulled out
one tour earlier, my wife...

50:41.956 --> 50:45.960
...my kid, they’d still be here.

50:49.964 --> 50:51.924
My family.

50:53.843 --> 50:55.762
Don’t get much more death
around you than that.

50:55.845 --> 50:57.472
-John.
-No, no.

50:57.555 --> 50:59.348
You’re not responsible
for any of that.

50:59.432 --> 51:00.975
But I am.

51:02.393 --> 51:04.395
It’s my family.

51:08.399 --> 51:10.359
I’m gonna make it right.

51:12.278 --> 51:15.573
After that,
my life doesn’t matter.

51:15.656 --> 51:17.241
This isn’t a revenge mission.

51:17.325 --> 51:19.327
This is an extraction.

51:20.620 --> 51:24.540
We are going to
bring him to justice.

51:24.624 --> 51:27.251
Tell me that’s gonna
be enough for you.

51:30.463 --> 51:34.926
I’m done making promises
that I can’t keep.

51:44.477 --> 51:45.978
PILOT
This is the captain.

51:46.062 --> 51:47.855
30 minutes to HALO jump.

51:47.939 --> 51:49.690
Prepare for drop.

51:50.858 --> 51:52.693
JOHN:
Let’s go, boys.

51:53.694 --> 51:55.905
What’d you dream about?

51:55.988 --> 51:57.657
You.

52:05.331 --> 52:07.250
JOHN:
Check your equipment!

52:09.544 --> 52:11.128
Two minutes to drop, fellas.

52:11.212 --> 52:13.005
Stand by. Stand by.

52:18.594 --> 52:20.513
RUSSIAN PILOT
This is Russian Air Force,

52:20.596 --> 52:22.557
armed, S-U-five-seven.

52:22.640 --> 52:24.058
You have been intercepted.

52:24.141 --> 52:25.768
-Acknowledge.
-Abort, abort!

52:25.852 --> 52:27.228
Abort! Abort the jump!

52:27.311 --> 52:28.688
PILOT
This is Transatlantic 104.

52:28.771 --> 52:30.606
We are en route
from Leipzig/Halle

52:30.690 --> 52:32.149
to Anchorage with clearance.

52:32.233 --> 52:33.568
RUSSIAN PILOT:
Divert immediately

52:33.651 --> 52:35.027
to Murmansk Airdrome, ULM.

52:35.111 --> 52:36.988
Stay low, stay low,
st-stay low, stay low, stay low!

52:37.071 --> 52:38.531
He got a good look inside.

52:38.614 --> 52:40.366
RUSSIAN PILOT:
If you do not, your intentions

52:40.449 --> 52:42.368
will be considered hostile
to Russian Federation.

52:42.451 --> 52:44.245
You will be shot down.

52:44.328 --> 52:46.247
PILOT:
This is Transatlantic 104.

52:46.330 --> 52:47.957
You are garbled and unreadable.

52:48.040 --> 52:49.375
Can you repeat?

52:53.087 --> 52:54.171
PILOT:
Missile launch. Missile launch.

52:54.255 --> 52:55.631
Right, two o’clock.

52:55.715 --> 52:57.049
JOHN: Evasive maneuvers!
Evasive maneuvers!

52:59.302 --> 53:00.553
Brace, brace, brace!

53:06.058 --> 53:07.268
Brace!

53:12.648 --> 53:14.191
Can you put her down?

53:14.275 --> 53:15.860
We’re going for a swim.

53:15.943 --> 53:18.613
Get back and take a seat
and brace for hard impact.

53:22.450 --> 53:24.201
Sit down! Sit down!

53:24.285 --> 53:26.203
Strap in! Brace for impact!

53:55.691 --> 53:57.568
Is everybody good?!

53:57.652 --> 53:59.153
-THUNDER: We’re good.
-HATCHET: We’re good!

53:59.236 --> 54:01.155
-THUNDER: Go! Move! I got it!
-HATCHET: We got to move now!

54:01.238 --> 54:02.573
-Everybody, get out!
-DALLAS: Let’s go!

54:02.657 --> 54:03.950
-Evacuate now!
-No, I got to get...

54:04.033 --> 54:06.035
I got to get the gear.
We got to get the rest.

54:06.118 --> 54:07.787
Go! Leave it! Leave it!

54:07.870 --> 54:09.330
-DALLAS: Let’s go, boys!
-GREER: Come on!

54:09.413 --> 54:10.831
There’s no mission
without the gear!

54:10.915 --> 54:12.625
-DALLAS: Come on, let’s go!
-There’s no mission...

54:12.708 --> 54:15.711
-HATCHET: Get out. Get out.

54:15.795 --> 54:17.505
I got to get the gear.

54:17.588 --> 54:19.966
-HATCHET: We got to move!
-

54:26.305 --> 54:28.182
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

54:34.772 --> 54:36.565
HATCHET: Where you going?
Where you going?

54:36.649 --> 54:38.359
JOHN:
I got to get the gear.

54:38.442 --> 54:40.569
-You can’t go back there.

54:40.653 --> 54:42.446
I got to get the Zodiac.

54:42.530 --> 54:44.115
Kelly!

56:06.447 --> 56:08.449
-

57:15.599 --> 57:17.685
GREER
John! John!

57:17.768 --> 57:19.728
Get him up to the surface!

57:19.812 --> 57:21.147
-All right, we got you.

57:21.230 --> 57:22.439
We got you, we got you,
we got you.

57:22.523 --> 57:23.524
-Grab the gear.
-Come on.

57:23.607 --> 57:24.817
-Come on.
-Grab the gear.

57:24.900 --> 57:27.361
We got the Zodiac.
Hold on to it.

57:27.444 --> 57:28.904
Come on. Come on.

57:28.988 --> 57:30.030
Come on, you did it.

57:30.114 --> 57:32.825
You did it, homey.
You did it. Come on.

58:39.600 --> 58:41.936
Hey, they’re pulling us out,
right?

58:42.019 --> 58:44.813
Not until the mission’s over.

58:44.897 --> 58:48.609
Well, I figured, since we just
exploded in the sky...

58:49.652 --> 58:51.737
Bet everyone thinks we’re dead.

58:51.820 --> 58:54.657
Well, that’s the one thing
we got going for us.

58:56.659 --> 58:59.203
Ricardo.

58:59.286 --> 59:01.205
That’s my real name.

59:01.288 --> 59:03.999
If we’re gonna die together,

59:04.083 --> 59:06.585
may as well drop
the code names, right?

59:07.795 --> 59:09.797
Franklin.

59:11.173 --> 59:12.883
-Seymour.
-

59:12.967 --> 59:14.635
Hey, don’t say shit, all right?

59:20.099 --> 59:21.934
Karen.

59:23.936 --> 59:25.980
John.

59:28.023 --> 59:30.317
Isn’t this nice?

59:31.819 --> 59:34.613
Mm. Still not adding up.

59:34.697 --> 59:37.199
What if us getting shot down
wasn’t an accident?

59:37.283 --> 59:39.159
It’s really hard to forget about

59:39.243 --> 59:41.245
that last mission
we went on with Ritter.

59:41.328 --> 59:43.580
You were in the briefing.
You heard what they said.

59:43.664 --> 59:45.791
Ritter was the one
who said Rykov was dead.

59:45.874 --> 59:48.419
He was also the one
who stopped the investigation

59:48.502 --> 59:51.422
into my wife’s murder.
Isn’t that right?

59:51.505 --> 59:53.340
So now he’s the only asshole,

59:53.424 --> 59:55.050
the only one
that wasn’t on the plane.

59:55.134 --> 59:56.677
GREER:
Give me a reason.

59:56.760 --> 59:59.471
What reason would he possibly
have to sack the mission?

59:59.555 --> 1:00:00.931
Don’t know.

1:00:01.015 --> 1:00:05.019
But either way,
I’m going to get some answers.

1:00:06.312 --> 1:00:08.731
You tracking me?

1:00:09.982 --> 1:00:12.609
According to
senior Kremlin officials,

1:00:12.693 --> 1:00:16.322
the Airbus was not a
Transatlantic Airlines flight...

1:00:16.405 --> 1:00:18.407
But a spy aircraft
operated by the American CIA.

1:00:18.490 --> 1:00:20.492
One official stated
that the fake manifest...

1:00:20.576 --> 1:00:22.453
JOHN: Hey, turn around.
Slowly! Slowly!

1:00:22.536 --> 1:00:23.829
Hands up. Hands up.

1:00:23.912 --> 1:00:24.913
I’ll stitch you up.

1:00:24.997 --> 1:00:26.040
-Search it.
-Sit down.

1:00:26.123 --> 1:00:28.500
-Sit down. Sit down. Down.
-Search it.

1:00:28.584 --> 1:00:30.127
RITTER:
What’s happening here, Greer?

1:00:30.210 --> 1:00:31.879
Quiet!

1:00:33.922 --> 1:00:36.467
-What’s the money for, Ritter?
-Listen, why don’t we just

1:00:36.550 --> 1:00:37.801
put the guns down
and we can talk about

1:00:37.885 --> 1:00:39.053
what the hell is going on here!

1:00:39.136 --> 1:00:40.471
Why don’t you tell us
what our real mission is?

1:00:40.554 --> 1:00:41.680
You know what
my mission is, man.

1:00:41.764 --> 1:00:43.140
Now, why weren’t you
on the plane?

1:00:43.223 --> 1:00:44.683
How did they know
where to find us?

1:00:44.767 --> 1:00:46.560
-Russian airspace...
-Bullshit!

1:00:46.643 --> 1:00:48.062
-Same thing happened in Aleppo.
-

1:00:48.145 --> 1:00:50.481
What’s the real mission?

1:00:50.564 --> 1:00:53.192
-Talk.

1:00:53.275 --> 1:00:55.402
I’m trying to get Rykov!

1:00:56.904 --> 1:00:58.781
Ask him. Ask him.

1:00:58.864 --> 1:01:00.741
JOHN:
Speak.

1:01:01.950 --> 1:01:03.577
He offer us money

1:01:03.660 --> 1:01:06.038
to help capture target
in apartment building,

1:01:06.121 --> 1:01:07.831
get him to U.S. base in Finland.

1:01:07.915 --> 1:01:10.292
We thought you were dead!
We had to finish.

1:01:10.376 --> 1:01:12.503
-The threat of more attacks
is real. -THUNDER: Stay down!

1:01:12.586 --> 1:01:14.546
We need to get Rykov.

1:01:14.630 --> 1:01:16.006
We said no,
we cannot help, okay?

1:01:16.090 --> 1:01:18.759
We’re advance only.
We have families.

1:01:19.802 --> 1:01:21.804
He’s telling the truth!

1:01:23.055 --> 1:01:25.265
You want Rykov?
I can get you to him.

1:01:25.349 --> 1:01:27.226
-That’s what you want, isn’t it?
-

1:01:27.309 --> 1:01:29.311
Easy! Easy!

1:01:29.395 --> 1:01:31.355
Get right here.
You think it’s a game?!

1:01:31.438 --> 1:01:32.856
Huh?

1:01:35.859 --> 1:01:37.194
Hmm?

1:01:41.740 --> 1:01:43.826
I didn’t sell you out.

1:02:09.059 --> 1:02:11.353
You’re out of your goddamn mind!

1:02:59.860 --> 1:03:01.904
THUNDER:
Home sweet home.

1:03:03.405 --> 1:03:05.240
OLEKSIY:
Target is in the kitchen.

1:03:05.324 --> 1:03:07.075
He’s sitting at a table
drinking.

1:03:07.159 --> 1:03:09.036
-GREER: Is he alone?
-OLEKSIY: Two bodyguards.

1:03:34.937 --> 1:03:36.939
I’m just looking.

1:04:19.940 --> 1:04:22.401
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

1:04:26.655 --> 1:04:28.865
GREER
John, what do you see?

1:04:38.208 --> 1:04:39.209
Damn it, John!

1:04:39.293 --> 1:04:41.128
Damn it, John, open the door.

1:04:41.211 --> 1:04:42.212
Open the door.

1:04:42.296 --> 1:04:44.423
John.

1:04:44.506 --> 1:04:46.717
-Get the fucking door open.
-Get the crowbar.

1:04:46.800 --> 1:04:49.803
-

1:05:00.314 --> 1:05:03.400
RYKOV
John Kelly.

1:05:03.483 --> 1:05:05.652
Good to see you again.

1:05:08.363 --> 1:05:10.574
My wife’s name was Pam.

1:05:12.159 --> 1:05:14.995
And you’re gonna say it
before you die.

1:05:17.831 --> 1:05:19.833
RYKOV:
I didn’t kill your wife.

1:05:21.126 --> 1:05:22.961
A decision did.

1:05:25.088 --> 1:05:27.007
Pawns, John, both of us.

1:05:27.090 --> 1:05:31.595
We’re just pawns
serving the same king.

1:05:34.890 --> 1:05:37.517
Do you know
I’m in the CIA, John?

1:05:37.601 --> 1:05:39.436
Did they tell you that?

1:05:41.688 --> 1:05:43.690
We wanted you here.

1:05:45.567 --> 1:05:47.736
You or anyone like you.

1:05:52.658 --> 1:05:54.701
What did they tell you,
that you were here

1:05:54.785 --> 1:05:57.245
to prevent an upcoming attack?

1:05:59.581 --> 1:06:01.917
There are no other ops, John.

1:06:03.502 --> 1:06:06.129
You and me being here...

1:06:06.213 --> 1:06:08.423
-is the op.
-

1:06:23.063 --> 1:06:25.482
We fancy ourselves
true patriots.

1:06:28.985 --> 1:06:31.863
We accept the possibility
of our death.

1:06:36.284 --> 1:06:38.704
Both of us.

1:06:47.546 --> 1:06:51.758
Our lives offered willingly
for the highest cause.

1:06:52.801 --> 1:06:54.177
Yeah?

1:06:54.261 --> 1:06:55.762
What cause is that?

1:06:55.846 --> 1:06:58.098
America, John.

1:07:02.561 --> 1:07:04.563
All we have to do is die.

1:07:04.646 --> 1:07:05.897
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

1:07:05.981 --> 1:07:07.816
Let-let’s just...
let’s just talk about things.

1:07:07.899 --> 1:07:10.277
Let’s just talk for
a little bit longer, okay?

1:07:14.406 --> 1:07:18.160
Those behind us in Washington...

1:07:18.243 --> 1:07:20.829
are not the only true patriots.

1:07:42.768 --> 1:07:44.770
HATCHET:
Everybody all right?

1:07:48.315 --> 1:07:50.233
HATCHET:
Let’s go! Let’s get out!

1:07:53.528 --> 1:07:54.988
HATCHET:
We have to move!

1:08:06.833 --> 1:08:09.503
He wanted us here.
He was waiting for us.

1:08:09.586 --> 1:08:11.129
- Shit!

1:08:11.213 --> 1:08:12.339
Sniper!

1:08:12.422 --> 1:08:14.424
-

1:08:18.512 --> 1:08:21.014
-Hey, Dallas is down!
-GREER: Dallas!

1:08:22.766 --> 1:08:25.977
-Who’s got eyes on it?
-THUNDER: Dallas is down!

1:08:26.061 --> 1:08:27.896
JOHN:
Where’s it coming from?

1:08:29.189 --> 1:08:30.273
THUNDER:
Dallas, where are you hit?

1:08:30.357 --> 1:08:31.608
-Dallas is hit.
-DALLAS: In my stomach.

1:08:31.691 --> 1:08:32.943
Dallas, can you move?

1:08:33.026 --> 1:08:34.694
I can’t.

1:08:34.778 --> 1:08:36.780
Talk to me, Dallas.
You’re all right, man.

1:08:36.863 --> 1:08:38.365
We’re gonna get you
out of there.

1:08:38.448 --> 1:08:40.534
-Where is he at?
-THUNDER: Hey!

1:08:40.617 --> 1:08:42.702
Kelly, it’s from your six!

1:08:46.915 --> 1:08:49.876
-JOHN: I can’t see him!
-

1:08:49.960 --> 1:08:52.045
HATCHET:
Thunder, lay down some fire!

1:08:52.128 --> 1:08:54.381
Kelly, it’s from your six.

1:08:57.676 --> 1:08:59.177
Help me.

1:08:59.261 --> 1:09:01.638
Hey, hey,
I won’t leave you here.

1:09:01.721 --> 1:09:03.056
-It’s not naptime.

1:09:03.139 --> 1:09:04.307
JOHN: Cover me, cover me,
cover me, cover me.

1:09:04.391 --> 1:09:06.101
Move.

1:09:14.067 --> 1:09:16.361
Coming back to you.
Crossing, crossing, crossing!

1:09:16.444 --> 1:09:18.947
-

1:09:21.491 --> 1:09:23.493
THUNDER:
Dallas, hang in there, buddy!

1:09:33.086 --> 1:09:36.214
-Third floor, second window!
-Third floor, second window!

1:09:36.298 --> 1:09:39.843
-Lay down some cover!
-I’m pinned down! Cover fire!

1:09:44.472 --> 1:09:47.392
You’re covered! Get him!
Go, go, go!

1:09:49.102 --> 1:09:50.729
Come on.

1:09:50.812 --> 1:09:53.565
Second sniper!

1:09:56.443 --> 1:09:58.403
There’s a second sniper!

1:09:58.486 --> 1:09:59.905
12 o’clock!

1:10:10.457 --> 1:10:12.250
JOHN:
Get him out of there!

1:10:22.218 --> 1:10:23.720
Get me out of here!

1:10:28.975 --> 1:10:30.685
Goddamn it.

1:10:32.228 --> 1:10:33.772
Shit!

1:10:33.855 --> 1:10:34.981
Hey.

1:10:35.065 --> 1:10:37.067
Ritter, this in the brief?

1:10:38.652 --> 1:10:41.112
-We need an out.
-Thunder’s down!

1:10:41.196 --> 1:10:42.822
There’s a sniper
covering the entry point!

1:10:42.906 --> 1:10:44.491
We need to find another way!

1:10:44.574 --> 1:10:46.159
You still in the fight, Thunder?

1:10:46.242 --> 1:10:48.662
Still in the game, ma’am.
I got our six.

1:10:48.745 --> 1:10:50.163
All right.

1:10:52.874 --> 1:10:54.876
I’m screening the situation.

1:10:54.960 --> 1:10:57.003
Hatchet, Kelly, cover me.

1:10:57.087 --> 1:10:58.296
-Got you.
-Moving. -Moving.

1:10:58.380 --> 1:11:00.048
Covering fire!

1:11:05.804 --> 1:11:07.764
We got to frag that sniper.

1:11:07.847 --> 1:11:09.599
-

1:11:09.683 --> 1:11:10.850
GREER:
Cease fire.

1:11:10.934 --> 1:11:12.978
-Cease fire.

1:11:36.376 --> 1:11:38.795
They just killed
two police officers.

1:11:43.216 --> 1:11:44.759
Shit.

1:11:44.843 --> 1:11:46.845
’Cause it looks like we did it.

1:11:53.101 --> 1:11:54.728
The dead Russians in my house.

1:11:56.062 --> 1:11:58.523
They wanted us to find ’em.

1:11:58.606 --> 1:12:00.358
They wanted us to find
a dead Russian soldier

1:12:00.442 --> 1:12:02.318
on American soil.

1:12:03.611 --> 1:12:05.822
And if we die here,
then they’ll find a bunch

1:12:05.905 --> 1:12:08.742
of dead American soldiers
on Russian soil, too.

1:12:09.826 --> 1:12:11.578
JOHN:
And if we kill a couple cops

1:12:11.661 --> 1:12:13.788
on the way out of here,
even better.

1:12:13.872 --> 1:12:15.248
GREER:
Jesus.

1:12:17.584 --> 1:12:19.502
Everything--

1:12:19.586 --> 1:12:22.213
the assassination of the team,

1:12:22.297 --> 1:12:25.341
my house, this op--

1:12:25.425 --> 1:12:27.427
it was a setup
from the beginning.

1:12:29.971 --> 1:12:32.515
They’re trying to start a war.

1:12:40.148 --> 1:12:41.983
Like Rykov said,

1:12:42.067 --> 1:12:44.277
now all we got to do is die.

1:12:46.780 --> 1:12:49.407
GREER:
Yeah, we’re not gonna do that.

1:12:49.491 --> 1:12:51.076
All right.

1:12:51.159 --> 1:12:53.078
We got to take out
this sniper in the hallway.

1:12:53.161 --> 1:12:54.788
I need you to buy us an exit.

1:12:54.871 --> 1:12:56.331
Tracking.

1:12:58.333 --> 1:13:00.126
-Moving.
-Thunder, pass me your pack.

1:13:06.883 --> 1:13:08.802
-GREER: Moving!
-HATCHET: Laying down cover!

1:13:18.436 --> 1:13:19.604
JOHN:
Stay in it. Stay in it, fellas.

1:13:19.687 --> 1:13:21.272
HATCHET:
All right.

1:13:21.356 --> 1:13:23.108
I got him. I got him.

1:13:24.109 --> 1:13:25.652
RITTER:
All clear!

1:13:31.574 --> 1:13:33.701
JOHN: All right.
Let’s move. Let’s move.

1:13:56.391 --> 1:13:58.768
Hold tight!
We’re making a way!

1:13:58.852 --> 1:14:00.854
Push, push, push!

1:14:58.119 --> 1:15:00.121
-

1:15:09.005 --> 1:15:10.381
My gun jammed.

1:15:11.424 --> 1:15:13.051
Nice.

1:15:23.019 --> 1:15:24.979
JOHN:
All right.

1:15:27.398 --> 1:15:28.775
Time to go!

1:15:28.858 --> 1:15:30.443
Time to go,
time to go, time to go!

1:15:30.526 --> 1:15:31.694
Get out of here! Go!

1:15:31.778 --> 1:15:33.738
-All right, come here.

1:15:33.821 --> 1:15:35.156
-Almost there.

1:15:35.240 --> 1:15:36.324
Last man!

1:15:36.407 --> 1:15:38.701
Lobby, lobby, lobby!

1:15:38.785 --> 1:15:40.828
-Come on!
-HATCHET: Dallas, let’s go.

1:15:42.121 --> 1:15:43.706
JOHN:
Yeah, you almost there.

1:15:47.168 --> 1:15:48.795
JOHN:
To the right.

1:15:50.421 --> 1:15:52.674
Set him down, set him down,
set him down.

1:15:52.757 --> 1:15:53.967
Cover the exits!

1:15:56.761 --> 1:15:58.638
HATCHET:
Watch my six.

1:15:58.721 --> 1:16:00.181
All right, man.

1:16:05.812 --> 1:16:07.563
All right.

1:16:07.647 --> 1:16:09.649
-

1:16:11.693 --> 1:16:14.279
Hey, man.

1:16:14.362 --> 1:16:16.281
You got kids?

1:16:19.450 --> 1:16:21.286
What?

1:16:23.037 --> 1:16:24.706
Kids.

1:16:31.879 --> 1:16:35.591
DALLAS:
Yeah. Yeah.

1:16:35.675 --> 1:16:38.052
HATCHET: Anything you want me
to tell ’em?

1:16:40.305 --> 1:16:42.307
DALLAS:
Tell ’em, um,

1:16:42.390 --> 1:16:45.059
I love them.

1:16:45.143 --> 1:16:46.978
Sure.

1:16:49.272 --> 1:16:51.274
Tell ’em...

1:16:52.525 --> 1:16:54.277
Tell ’em...

1:17:20.970 --> 1:17:22.972
I got a plan.

1:17:24.891 --> 1:17:27.894
I’m gonna get up to the roof
and clear a path for you guys.

1:17:31.147 --> 1:17:34.484
We’re not leaving you behind.

1:17:34.567 --> 1:17:37.195
We can’t leave anybody behind.

1:17:39.197 --> 1:17:42.241
If we leave a trace,
they’re going to get their war.

1:17:42.325 --> 1:17:44.452
You got to get the team
out of here.

1:17:46.079 --> 1:17:47.705
To them, I’m not a soldier.

1:17:50.583 --> 1:17:52.919
I’m a felon.

1:17:53.002 --> 1:17:55.004
I can die here.

1:17:57.757 --> 1:17:59.425
Tracking?

1:18:09.268 --> 1:18:11.020
Hmm?

1:19:19.464 --> 1:19:21.466
-

1:19:52.955 --> 1:19:55.208
-

1:20:17.855 --> 1:20:20.566
Keep moving. Keep moving.

1:20:21.859 --> 1:20:23.069
Come on, Kelly.

1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:10.908
-

1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:28.402
-

1:22:36.661 --> 1:22:38.954
-

1:23:08.067 --> 1:23:09.694
Come on, baby.

1:23:23.749 --> 1:23:26.669
-

1:24:39.200 --> 1:24:41.202
-

1:25:18.489 --> 1:25:20.533
-Come on.
-

1:25:20.616 --> 1:25:22.618
Can you walk? Can you walk?

1:25:35.589 --> 1:25:37.591
The others went ahead.

1:26:36.233 --> 1:26:38.277
You guys heard
what Rykov said, right?

1:26:41.780 --> 1:26:44.074
He said it started in D.C.

1:26:46.201 --> 1:26:48.829
I thought I was
a pawn hunting a king.

1:26:52.750 --> 1:26:54.960
Rykov wasn’t a king.

1:26:55.044 --> 1:26:57.129
He was just me
on the other side.

1:26:59.131 --> 1:27:01.133
Pawns could never kill a king.

1:27:04.845 --> 1:27:07.306
All I’ve got
to go back to is jail.

1:27:20.152 --> 1:27:23.656
There’s a duffel bag of money
below deck.

1:27:25.658 --> 1:27:27.493
It’s yours.

1:27:30.454 --> 1:27:33.040
But you never made it out alive.

1:27:33.123 --> 1:27:35.334
You died in Murmansk.

1:27:38.879 --> 1:27:41.340
With you as a ghost,

1:27:41.423 --> 1:27:43.884
maybe we can find out
who’s behind this.

1:27:52.267 --> 1:27:54.561
I was wrong about you.

1:28:03.696 --> 1:28:05.572
REPORTER
...minister has accused the U.S.

1:28:05.656 --> 1:28:08.575
of an attack on a civilian
building in Murmansk

1:28:08.659 --> 1:28:10.744
which resulted
in multiple casualties.

1:28:10.828 --> 1:28:13.622
The White House denies
any connection.

1:28:13.706 --> 1:28:16.291
In response,
the U.S. has accused Russia

1:28:16.375 --> 1:28:18.919
of trying to shift blame
for the downed commercial flight

1:28:19.003 --> 1:28:20.671
over the Barents Sea.

1:28:20.754 --> 1:28:23.048
Each country has yet
to prove its claims,

1:28:23.132 --> 1:28:24.800
but the fact remains

1:28:24.883 --> 1:28:26.802
relations between
the two nations

1:28:26.885 --> 1:28:30.514
haven’t been this strained
since the Cold War.

1:28:30.597 --> 1:28:32.474
There are also concerns about

1:28:32.558 --> 1:28:35.561
how an escalation in tensions
could affect the economy.

1:28:35.644 --> 1:28:38.063
A U.S. trade representative
has stated that...

1:28:48.824 --> 1:28:50.826
JOHN:
Mr. Secretary.

1:28:52.036 --> 1:28:54.038
John.

1:28:56.206 --> 1:28:58.208
Greer told me you were dead.

1:28:58.292 --> 1:29:00.252
I’m sorry to sneak up
on you like this,

1:29:00.335 --> 1:29:02.421
but I had to go ghost.

1:29:02.504 --> 1:29:05.049
It was the only way I could
get you that information.

1:29:05.132 --> 1:29:07.551
Wh-What information?

1:29:07.634 --> 1:29:10.220
About the mission.

1:29:10.304 --> 1:29:12.848
We weren’t supposed to
make it out of there alive.

1:29:12.931 --> 1:29:14.683
Sir, this was a CIA op.

1:29:14.767 --> 1:29:16.518
They ran it out of D.C.
the entire time.

1:29:16.602 --> 1:29:18.353
They’re trying to heat up
tension with Russia.

1:29:23.275 --> 1:29:25.277
You’re not suggesting Dillard?

1:29:28.614 --> 1:29:29.948
I’ve known Sarah for years.

1:29:30.032 --> 1:29:31.825
I don’t always agree
with her methods,

1:29:31.909 --> 1:29:34.536
but she’s nothing
if not a patriot.

1:29:34.620 --> 1:29:36.830
I know she doesn’t seem
like the type of person

1:29:36.914 --> 1:29:38.624
that would put an operative
in an explosive vest,

1:29:38.707 --> 1:29:39.833
have him blow himself up.

1:29:39.917 --> 1:29:42.377
Well, that’s exactly my point.

1:29:42.461 --> 1:29:45.923
Thing is, Greer left
that part out of the report.

1:29:46.965 --> 1:29:49.551
And when I said that
just now, you...

1:29:49.635 --> 1:29:51.553
you didn’t seem a bit surprised.

1:29:55.933 --> 1:29:58.727
Well, nothing surprises me
anymore, John.

1:30:19.706 --> 1:30:21.458
There he goes.

1:30:24.962 --> 1:30:26.880
I don’t know what you think
you’re doing, sailor.

1:30:28.799 --> 1:30:30.759
Helpless, huh?

1:30:32.594 --> 1:30:35.514
You sent me all over this world,

1:30:35.597 --> 1:30:38.725
put my life on the line
because I believed that we were

1:30:38.809 --> 1:30:40.811
on the right side of things.

1:30:40.894 --> 1:30:43.647
That our way would keep
people like you in check.

1:30:43.730 --> 1:30:45.274
Pull over, John.

1:30:45.357 --> 1:30:48.193
-You’re confused.
-So you’re gonna tell me why.

1:30:50.696 --> 1:30:52.656
Why my family?

1:30:52.739 --> 1:30:54.032
My wife?

1:30:54.116 --> 1:30:55.951
My daughter?

1:30:56.034 --> 1:30:58.036
Why kill my team?

1:30:59.705 --> 1:31:02.249
Rykov was all in,

1:31:02.332 --> 1:31:04.835
so I’d like a little bit
of what you sold him.

1:31:04.918 --> 1:31:06.545
You are making a mistake.

1:31:06.628 --> 1:31:08.380
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:31:08.463 --> 1:31:10.424
Know where we driving?

1:31:12.509 --> 1:31:15.095
You got a farm
out in West Virginia, right?

1:31:17.556 --> 1:31:19.808
Your daughter should be
home from college.

1:31:21.310 --> 1:31:23.312
Wesleyan.
That’s a good school.

1:31:24.771 --> 1:31:26.356
Your wife.

1:31:26.440 --> 1:31:28.984
-Your son, too.
-

1:31:29.067 --> 1:31:31.945
-So I suggest you start talking.
-

1:31:32.029 --> 1:31:33.780
Because if you don’t,

1:31:33.864 --> 1:31:37.701
I’m gonna make you watch me kill
your whole damn family.

1:31:37.784 --> 1:31:40.871
I never met Rykov in my life.

1:31:40.954 --> 1:31:43.040
I’m listening.

1:31:49.713 --> 1:31:51.798
You know who won World War II?

1:31:53.634 --> 1:31:56.178
It wasn’t the generals
or the admirals.

1:31:56.261 --> 1:31:58.597
It was the economists.

1:31:58.680 --> 1:32:01.767
More tanks, planes, ships.

1:32:01.850 --> 1:32:03.894
And all that spending lifted

1:32:03.977 --> 1:32:05.896
this entire nation
out of poverty.

1:32:05.979 --> 1:32:09.107
Freed the world from tyranny.

1:32:09.191 --> 1:32:13.028
A big country needs big enemies.

1:32:13.111 --> 1:32:16.573
The best enemy we ever had
was the Soviet Union.

1:32:16.657 --> 1:32:21.411
Our fear of them
unified our people.

1:32:21.495 --> 1:32:23.413
Gave us purpose.

1:32:24.665 --> 1:32:26.625
The problem today, John,

1:32:26.708 --> 1:32:29.461
is half this country thinks
the other half is its enemy

1:32:29.544 --> 1:32:31.713
because they have
no one else to fight.

1:32:33.131 --> 1:32:34.883
So...

1:32:34.967 --> 1:32:37.886
we gave them a real enemy.

1:32:37.970 --> 1:32:40.555
One with the power
to threaten their lives,

1:32:40.639 --> 1:32:42.474
their freedoms.

1:32:42.557 --> 1:32:45.060
Freedoms you take for granted.

1:32:46.561 --> 1:32:49.147
And it works, John.
It works.

1:32:50.941 --> 1:32:53.151
You just wouldn’t die.

1:32:54.194 --> 1:32:58.991
You had no right
to take so much from us.

1:32:59.074 --> 1:33:02.077
No, I did. I swore an oath.

1:33:04.371 --> 1:33:06.873
Me, too.

1:33:06.957 --> 1:33:08.792
To my wife.

1:33:10.002 --> 1:33:12.921
Her name was Pam.

1:33:13.005 --> 1:33:16.383
And you’re gonna say it
before you die.

1:33:18.385 --> 1:33:19.886
Uh, what...

1:33:19.970 --> 1:33:21.805
-

1:33:34.151 --> 1:33:36.069
You’re gonna say her name.

1:33:36.153 --> 1:33:38.196
Get me out of here!

1:33:38.280 --> 1:33:40.324
Say her name.

1:33:40.407 --> 1:33:41.825
Get me out of here!

1:33:47.331 --> 1:33:49.416
Say it!

1:33:49.499 --> 1:33:50.709
Pam!

1:33:53.170 --> 1:33:54.880
Pam!

1:34:00.677 --> 1:34:02.721
Pam!

1:34:05.057 --> 1:34:06.475
Pam...

1:35:11.498 --> 1:35:13.500
PAM:
There is a heaven.

1:35:18.797 --> 1:35:21.007
Mm, is this it?

1:35:22.050 --> 1:35:24.678
No, baby, it’s not.

1:35:29.558 --> 1:35:31.852
What about you?

1:35:31.935 --> 1:35:34.187
Are you in heaven?

1:35:34.271 --> 1:35:36.064
I’m with you.

1:35:44.281 --> 1:35:46.283
Not always.

1:35:48.076 --> 1:35:50.537
No, not always.

1:35:50.620 --> 1:35:52.414
But now.

1:35:59.045 --> 1:36:01.465
Pam, I miss you.

1:36:01.548 --> 1:36:03.550
I know.

1:36:05.427 --> 1:36:07.429
It’s okay.

1:36:17.772 --> 1:36:20.817
WEST: "And lead us not
into temptation,

1:36:20.901 --> 1:36:23.195
"but deliver us from evil.

1:36:24.863 --> 1:36:27.616
"For thine is the kingdom

1:36:27.699 --> 1:36:30.744
"and the power and the glory

1:36:30.827 --> 1:36:33.663
"forever and ever.

1:36:33.747 --> 1:36:35.582
Amen."

1:37:10.033 --> 1:37:11.785
REPORTER
Although the precise nature

1:37:11.868 --> 1:37:13.662
of the action
remains classified,

1:37:13.745 --> 1:37:15.413
it apparently cost the life

1:37:15.497 --> 1:37:17.541
of Secretary of Defense
Thomas Clay,

1:37:17.624 --> 1:37:20.085
who was found dead
in the Potomac River last week

1:37:20.168 --> 1:37:21.545
in an apparent suicide.

1:37:21.628 --> 1:37:23.296
Emerging reports suggest

1:37:23.380 --> 1:37:25.799
he was involved
in a potentially treason...

1:37:25.882 --> 1:37:28.510
JOHN:
Hey. I was listening to that.

1:37:33.682 --> 1:37:35.850
Lot less people than I thought.

1:38:06.881 --> 1:38:10.135
CLAY
We gave them a real enemy.

1:38:10.218 --> 1:38:12.721
One with the power
to threaten their lives,

1:38:12.804 --> 1:38:14.681
their freedoms.

1:38:14.764 --> 1:38:16.766
Freedoms you take for granted.

1:38:18.268 --> 1:38:20.854
And it works, John.
It works.

1:38:23.064 --> 1:38:25.066
You just wouldn’t die.

1:38:29.487 --> 1:38:31.489
I need a favor.

1:38:46.713 --> 1:38:49.132
Vaseliev did say that
none of this would be over

1:38:49.215 --> 1:38:51.635
until John Kelly was dead.

1:38:55.347 --> 1:38:57.098
Here’s your new legend,

1:38:57.182 --> 1:38:59.601
courtesy of
your little friend Ritter.

1:39:02.771 --> 1:39:04.939
"John Clark."

1:39:05.023 --> 1:39:06.941
That’s real creative.

1:39:07.025 --> 1:39:10.028
Yeah, well, the CIA isn’t
exactly known for that.

1:39:10.111 --> 1:39:12.030
That’s fair.

1:39:13.907 --> 1:39:16.201
What are you gonna do, John?

1:39:19.037 --> 1:39:22.624
What we do best: disappear.

1:39:26.753 --> 1:39:29.130
And I know
you’re dead and all now,

1:39:29.214 --> 1:39:31.466
but don’t be a stranger.

1:39:31.549 --> 1:39:33.468
Yes, ma’am.

1:41:51.606 --> 1:41:53.608
Director.

1:41:54.943 --> 1:41:57.445
Congratulations on
the promotion, by the way.

1:41:58.696 --> 1:42:00.532
RITTER:
Thank you.

1:42:02.408 --> 1:42:06.663
Got to say I was surprised
when you, uh, came back to D.C.

1:42:08.206 --> 1:42:10.542
I’ve been thinking
about what happened.

1:42:12.168 --> 1:42:14.379
About how it could happen again.

1:42:17.006 --> 1:42:19.092
So I put together some thoughts.

1:42:20.677 --> 1:42:24.722
A multinational
counterterrorist team,

1:42:24.806 --> 1:42:29.978
made up of U.S., U.K.,
hand-selected NATO personnel,

1:42:30.061 --> 1:42:33.523
with the full support of their
national intelligence services.

1:42:33.606 --> 1:42:36.693
And who’s gonna run
that kind of thing?

1:42:36.776 --> 1:42:38.611
I will.

1:42:40.321 --> 1:42:42.824
I want to present it
to the president.

1:42:45.743 --> 1:42:47.954
Do you, now?

1:42:57.964 --> 1:42:59.883
Calling it Rainbow.

1:43:01.134 --> 1:43:03.011
Why is that?

1:43:07.181 --> 1:43:09.183
It’s personal.

1:43:15.064 --> 1:43:16.649
Hey, John.

1:43:20.069 --> 1:43:22.071
It’s good to have you back.

1:43:28.244 --> 1:43:30.246
It’s good to be back.
