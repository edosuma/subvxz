Previously on "Ghost Whisperer..."

00:02.339 --> 00:04.303
No! Wake up, mommy, wake up!

00:04.304 --> 00:06.064
Melinda! Oh, my God.

00:06.400 --> 00:09.051
It was a vision, you're OK!

00:09.086 --> 00:10.563
It felt so real.

00:10.597 --> 00:12.804
Honey, they're just
getting worse and worse.

00:12.839 --> 00:15.480
Melinda said Carl was afraid the
shadows were getting in his head.

00:15.515 --> 00:18.759
You think the shadows are
messing with Melinda's head?

00:18.793 --> 00:20.234
We protect each other.

00:20.268 --> 00:22.271
Whenever the cold things come.

00:22.306 --> 00:24.212
The shadows.

00:24.246 --> 00:25.316
Your son is in danger.

00:25.350 --> 00:27.853
So what you're saying
is that I can fix this

00:27.888 --> 00:30.925
If I make Aiden not see
ghosts. Or shadows.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.029
Don't you think we owe
it to Aiden to try?

00:32.063 --> 00:33.531
By changing him?

00:33.566 --> 00:36.520
If it would keep my son safe
and alive, I don't care.

01:52.300 --> 01:55.528
Watch out! I'm coming through!

01:56.845 --> 01:58.703
Look what I have!

01:59.938 --> 02:01.605
Jim, wake up.

02:01.639 --> 02:03.460
No.

02:03.461 --> 02:04.950
Get out of my way!

02:04.951 --> 02:07.619
It's Aiden. He's
talking to someone.

02:09.013 --> 02:11.352
Watch out! A bomb!

02:11.353 --> 02:12.504
Come here!

02:12.505 --> 02:14.619
Watch out!

02:19.346 --> 02:20.659
What are you doing?

02:20.693 --> 02:22.461
Who are you talking to?

02:22.497 --> 02:23.929
I was doing the voices.

02:23.965 --> 02:26.234
Oh. Good.

02:26.269 --> 02:28.769
We thought you were talking to...
somebody else.

02:28.803 --> 02:30.104
Like who?

02:30.138 --> 02:32.140
Um, nobody.

02:32.174 --> 02:33.909
Nobody. Let's go to bed. Mm-hmm.

02:33.943 --> 02:35.178
Yeah, do what your
mom says, come on.

02:35.212 --> 02:38.048
Come on, buddy, let's get up.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.019
I feel better.

02:45.153 --> 02:47.118
What do you mean?

02:47.152 --> 02:49.352
That there's no such
thing as ghosts.

02:49.386 --> 02:50.853
I feel better.

02:52.222 --> 02:55.425
Well, we feel better
that you feel better.

02:55.459 --> 02:57.293
Yeah.

03:03.267 --> 03:04.734
I hope we're doing
the right thing.

03:04.768 --> 03:07.169
We are. It's good that Aiden
was so easy to convince,

03:07.204 --> 03:08.304
And I think he's happy

03:08.338 --> 03:09.805
That he doesn't see
ghosts anymore.

03:09.840 --> 03:12.508
Still, something just
doesn't feel right.

03:12.542 --> 03:14.443
I feel like something's missing.

03:14.478 --> 03:16.379
It's probably just less
stress in the house.

03:16.413 --> 03:18.948
Maybe more.

03:29.159 --> 03:31.593
But I have to find it, mom!

03:31.628 --> 03:32.962
We'll look for it later.

03:32.996 --> 03:34.330
But he was the general!

03:34.364 --> 03:35.965
He was the main soldier.

03:35.999 --> 03:37.267
If you had put your toys
away like you' supposed to,

03:37.301 --> 03:38.701
You'd be able to find them.

03:38.736 --> 03:40.703
But the other soldiers won't
know what to do without him.

03:40.737 --> 03:42.305
Aiden, I don't want to
hear anymore about it, OK?

03:42.339 --> 03:43.940
It's just a toy
soldier. But it's not!

03:43.974 --> 03:46.309
Shh. Eh. Don't worry, I'll take
him to the bus stop. Go ahead.

03:46.343 --> 03:48.244
Thanks. Oh, the drain.

03:48.278 --> 03:50.513
In the tub. It's clogged, sorry.

03:50.547 --> 03:51.847
And you're telling me, why?

03:51.882 --> 03:52.982
Well, when you came back,
I didn't want you...

03:53.016 --> 03:54.984
'cause it's my job
to call the plumber?

03:55.018 --> 03:56.852
No, I just... every time

03:56.887 --> 03:58.287
Something is broken in this house,

03:58.321 --> 04:00.155
You just throw it at me like
it's my job to get it fixed.

04:00.190 --> 04:01.590
Not really. But I'll
call the plumber.

04:01.624 --> 04:03.859
No, forget it! I'll call.

04:06.229 --> 04:08.262
Mom's in a bad mood.

04:08.297 --> 04:10.298
You noticed that, too, did you?

04:10.332 --> 04:12.132
Come on.

04:12.167 --> 04:14.468
I am so glad things
are picking up.

04:14.502 --> 04:15.902
3 open houses in one day?

04:15.937 --> 04:17.202
We haven't seen that in months.

04:17.238 --> 04:19.204
And I had to make the
tremendous sacrifice

04:19.238 --> 04:21.242
Of taking a whole day
off from school to help.

04:21.274 --> 04:23.208
Oh, yeah, you're a real giver.

04:23.242 --> 04:25.479
How's everything at the store?

04:25.511 --> 04:27.316
I don't know.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.013
You don't know?

04:29.047 --> 04:31.382
Closed up early today. How come?

04:31.416 --> 04:33.717
I hate that place.

04:33.751 --> 04:35.152
What?

04:35.186 --> 04:36.519
I hate it.

04:36.554 --> 04:38.554
It's always so hot in there.
I hate everything in it.

04:38.588 --> 04:41.624
I'd be happy if I never had to
step foot in that place again.

04:41.658 --> 04:44.260
Mel, is everything OK?

04:44.294 --> 04:46.096
Yeah!

04:46.130 --> 04:47.630
Yeah, I'm gonna go see Jim.

04:47.665 --> 04:50.299
Hey, good luck on the open houses.

04:50.334 --> 04:52.268
Bye.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.733
It's all right, everybody
has their days.

05:31.750 --> 05:32.783
No, I just feel bad.

05:32.818 --> 05:34.251
I shouldn't have snapped
at you like that.

05:34.286 --> 05:36.440
No, I'm amazed you're as
even-tempered as you are,

05:36.441 --> 05:38.044
All the stress
you're usually under.

05:38.045 --> 05:40.014
How about I take you to
lunch to make up for it?

05:40.015 --> 05:41.918
Yes, that's a good idea.

05:41.919 --> 05:43.511
Yeah, I want to talk to you
about all the weird stuff

05:43.512 --> 05:44.666
That happened last night.

05:44.667 --> 05:46.812
Hospital's becoming
ghost central again.

05:46.813 --> 05:48.290
Look, I'll file these,
I'll be right back.

05:48.291 --> 05:49.433
Ok.

06:01.107 --> 06:02.373
Where did he go?

06:06.000 --> 06:08.634
It's not nice to
hide from your nurse.

06:08.668 --> 06:10.569
Maybe not. But it's fun.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.070
What's your name?

06:12.105 --> 06:15.073
Pete. Pistol Pete,
everybody calls me.

06:15.107 --> 06:16.474
I wonder why they call you that.

06:16.508 --> 06:18.676
Isn't the pediatric ward upstairs?

06:18.711 --> 06:20.077
I just wanted to get
something to drink.

06:20.112 --> 06:22.246
My doctor said it was OK,

06:22.280 --> 06:24.747
But I forgot to take money.

06:24.782 --> 06:27.217
All right.

06:27.251 --> 06:28.819
I'll make you a deal.

06:28.853 --> 06:30.220
I will get you something to drink

06:30.254 --> 06:31.755
If you go back to room,

06:31.789 --> 06:33.489
Ok? Deal.

06:40.329 --> 06:43.564
Oh, I can't believe
you fell for it!

06:43.599 --> 06:45.132
You're a ghost.

06:45.167 --> 06:47.201
No. Maybe you are.

06:50.538 --> 06:53.539
Come on, Juanita. I was
looking all over for you.

06:55.075 --> 06:56.742
Honey, I hate to say it, but...

06:56.777 --> 06:58.677
You look like you've
just seen a ghost.

06:58.712 --> 07:00.178
I did.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.680
But I didn't know it.

07:03.782 --> 07:05.548
I've always been able
to tell the difference

07:05.583 --> 07:06.883
Between the living and the dead.

07:06.917 --> 07:08.919
Their energy, the
way that they look.

07:08.953 --> 07:10.487
I feel it. I always know it.

07:10.521 --> 07:13.089
I just don't understand
why this is happening.

07:13.123 --> 07:14.691
And it's not just that.

07:14.725 --> 07:18.026
I just...I don't
feel right lately.

07:18.061 --> 07:20.262
I just don't know what to do.

07:20.296 --> 07:22.230
Eli?

07:22.264 --> 07:23.865
Are you there? Root canal.

07:23.899 --> 07:26.867
Did you just suggest
that I get a root canal?

07:26.901 --> 07:28.902
No.

07:33.007 --> 07:35.542
Eli, are you alright?

07:35.576 --> 07:37.009
"have to have root canal.

07:37.044 --> 07:38.677
Have a toothache, might be fatal."

07:38.712 --> 07:40.945
You know, toothaches are
generally not fatal.

07:40.980 --> 07:43.448
Mm-hmm.

07:43.482 --> 07:44.949
All right, Eli.

07:44.983 --> 07:47.351
Go to the dentist. I have to pick
up Aiden at the bus stop anyway.

07:48.719 --> 07:51.186
"I'll be more helpful when I'm
not in excruciating pain,

07:51.220 --> 07:52.954
Or when I'm dead
from the toothache."

07:52.988 --> 07:56.023
Well, I won't know the
difference, so, bye.

08:01.562 --> 08:03.696
This the house with
the naughty drain?

08:03.730 --> 08:05.498
Oh! Uh, did my husband call you?

08:05.532 --> 08:07.966
Yep. Upstairs bathroom tub, right?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.100
Right.

08:09.135 --> 08:11.269
George the plumber. Oh.

08:11.304 --> 08:13.638
Oh, you probably don't
want to shake hands

08:13.672 --> 08:14.872
After the job I just came from.

08:14.906 --> 08:16.140
Uh-huh.

08:16.174 --> 08:17.874
So what are we looking at?

08:17.909 --> 08:19.909
It's the bathtub drain.

08:19.943 --> 08:21.944
Ah, I love a good clog.

08:21.978 --> 08:23.679
It's my specialty.

08:23.713 --> 08:26.449
It's kind of like a mystery
that you have to unravel.

08:26.483 --> 08:28.518
Tell the truth, I'm always
a little disappointed

08:28.552 --> 08:31.186
If it's just a
garden-variety hairball.

08:31.221 --> 08:33.621
Where's the challenge in that?

08:33.655 --> 08:36.457
Um, OK, let's get started, 'cause
then I have to pick my son up,

08:36.457 --> 08:37.392
Down at the corner.

08:37.426 --> 08:39.227
My work is guaranteed.

08:39.260 --> 08:41.861
If I don't fix it, you don't pay.

08:41.895 --> 08:44.964
That way, your money
doesn't go down the drain.

08:44.998 --> 08:46.765
A little plumber humor.

09:00.311 --> 09:03.280
You hear that?

09:03.314 --> 09:05.682
Ah, I'm so glad.

09:05.716 --> 09:07.216
Man, I've been hearing
that every night.

09:07.250 --> 09:09.118
I thought I was going nuts.

09:09.152 --> 09:11.086
Ah.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.899
Where are we going, doc?

09:28.934 --> 09:31.735
Whoa! Uh, nowhere.

09:31.769 --> 09:33.870
Um, nowhere. I was just

09:33.904 --> 09:36.238
Repositioning you a little bit.

09:36.273 --> 09:37.306
Oh.

09:37.341 --> 09:39.042
We're all good.

09:39.076 --> 09:41.744
Did you find my soldier, mom?

09:41.779 --> 09:43.312
Hmm? No, I'm sorry.

09:43.347 --> 09:45.481
I gotta find him! We will.

09:45.515 --> 09:47.616
I know what's it's like
to have lost something.

09:47.650 --> 09:49.384
We need to talk.

09:49.418 --> 09:51.219
Come on, Aiden.

09:51.254 --> 09:53.955
Melinda, I've been
hearing things...

09:53.989 --> 09:55.523
Melinda!

09:55.557 --> 09:57.158
You need to know what...

09:57.192 --> 09:58.659
Melinda!

10:09.837 --> 10:11.671
I don't get it.

10:11.705 --> 10:14.740
They can do heart surgery
with laser beams,

10:14.775 --> 10:15.841
But to cure a toothache,

10:15.875 --> 10:17.309
You still have to sit
in a torture chair

10:17.343 --> 10:19.444
And let someone actually drill

10:19.478 --> 10:21.112
Into your tooth.

10:21.147 --> 10:23.114
Barbaric.

10:23.148 --> 10:25.249
Yeah, I can see, this
is not a good time.

10:25.283 --> 10:26.550
I just have one question.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.919
Why is Melinda ignoring me?

10:29.954 --> 10:31.854
Uh...

10:31.888 --> 10:33.989
Talking?

10:34.024 --> 10:37.092
Me talking? I said something.

10:37.126 --> 10:40.261
To you? No. Ok, who?

10:43.198 --> 10:46.232
Long hair, cute, um,

10:46.267 --> 10:49.435
Pretty. I said
something to Melinda?

10:51.372 --> 10:55.675
Ouch! I hate that part.

10:55.709 --> 10:57.008
What did I say?

10:57.043 --> 10:59.309
Um, eyes.

10:59.344 --> 11:01.978
Circle, symbol for no.

11:02.013 --> 11:03.280
No eyes.

11:03.314 --> 11:04.781
No...no looking.

11:04.815 --> 11:05.782
No...no seeing.

11:05.816 --> 11:07.082
No...no seeing ghosts.

11:07.117 --> 11:09.718
I told Melinda not to see ghosts.

11:09.753 --> 11:12.153
But...small.

11:12.188 --> 11:13.621
Small...small person.

11:13.655 --> 11:16.155
Aiden shouldn't see ghosts?

11:16.189 --> 11:17.923
I told Melinda that?

11:17.957 --> 11:20.725
But I have no recollection
of saying that!

11:20.760 --> 11:21.926
Anything like that.

11:21.961 --> 11:24.362
There's no way...

11:24.396 --> 11:26.630
The shadows.

11:26.665 --> 11:29.665
I told Melinda they've been
in and out of my head lately.

11:29.700 --> 11:32.534
What if they made me say that?

11:32.569 --> 11:33.969
What if...

11:34.003 --> 11:35.637
Eli, I don't know
what's going on here,

11:35.672 --> 11:37.339
But I do know this...

11:37.373 --> 11:39.407
Ok, just relax.

11:39.441 --> 11:41.909
Convincing Aiden
he can't see ghosts

11:41.943 --> 11:46.113
Is the worst, the most dangerous
thing Melinda can do right now.

11:46.147 --> 11:48.515
Ooh.

11:48.549 --> 11:50.383
It sounds like a
classic poltergeist.

11:50.417 --> 11:52.585
Well, whatever this classic
poltergeist is, he's gotta go.

11:52.620 --> 11:54.254
'cause of all the hauntings
we've had in the hospital...

11:54.288 --> 11:55.688
Sally stitch, the morgue ghost,

11:55.723 --> 11:57.023
None were this aggressive.

11:57.058 --> 11:58.858
Don't forget what the shadows
did to Bedford's mother.

11:58.893 --> 12:00.593
That was fairly aggressive.

12:00.628 --> 12:02.462
Wait, do you think
this is shadow related?

12:02.496 --> 12:04.397
No, I think it's a mischievous

12:04.431 --> 12:05.497
13-year-old boy related.

12:05.532 --> 12:07.897
Ok. So you can cross him over?

12:07.931 --> 12:08.930
I'll try, but the baby-sitter

12:08.964 --> 12:10.197
Has to be home at midnight.

12:10.231 --> 12:12.265
Ah, ghost hunting based on
the baby-sitter's schedule.

12:12.300 --> 12:13.700
That's what our
lives have come to.

12:13.734 --> 12:16.436
The price you pay for
using living baby-sitters.

12:16.470 --> 12:17.637
Hilarious.

12:17.671 --> 12:19.772
Gotta go. Bye.

13:32.757 --> 13:35.852
Here input Chinese only

13:42.570 --> 13:44.738
Here input Chinese only

13:46.600 --> 13:49.131
No time now, tough
ghost to cross over.

13:49.132 --> 13:49.948
This is important.

13:49.949 --> 13:53.103
I never told you to get
Aiden to stop seeing ghosts.

13:53.104 --> 13:55.086
I would never tell
you or anyone else

13:55.087 --> 13:56.466
To deny your gifts.

13:56.467 --> 13:57.875
Just back off. I've been warned.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.634
I know what you're trying to do.

13:59.668 --> 14:01.235
All right, maybe I was
possessed by the shadows

14:01.269 --> 14:03.637
When I told you that...
If I told you that.

14:03.671 --> 14:05.506
Really? Possessed?
Is that then or now?

14:05.540 --> 14:08.142
Shadows can manipulate
the living and the dead.

14:08.176 --> 14:09.443
You know that. Once
they get in your head,

14:09.478 --> 14:11.512
They can make you
say and do anything.

14:11.546 --> 14:15.313
But this is me... the real me.

14:15.348 --> 14:16.882
All right, the dead me.

14:16.916 --> 14:18.484
But still, me.

14:18.518 --> 14:19.451
Still Carl.

14:19.486 --> 14:20.752
You are wasting your time.

14:20.786 --> 14:23.554
The shadows don't want
you crossing souls over.

14:23.589 --> 14:25.022
And they don't want Aiden

14:25.056 --> 14:26.757
To follow in your footsteps.

14:26.791 --> 14:28.625
You have powers that
threaten what they can do.

14:28.659 --> 14:31.460
You and Aiden see things
other people can't,

14:31.495 --> 14:34.362
So the shadows want
to consume you both.

14:34.397 --> 14:36.297
That's why this is the worst time

14:36.331 --> 14:38.865
To make Aiden deny his powers.

14:38.899 --> 14:40.833
You're vulnerable now!

14:40.868 --> 14:44.537
The shadows are going
to use y to get to him.

14:44.571 --> 14:46.238
You'll kw when they
start to get to you.

14:46.273 --> 14:47.906
You'll feel your powers eroding.

14:47.940 --> 14:49.941
Already you're having trouble
telling visions fr reality.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.577
Who the hell do you think you are?

14:52.611 --> 14:54.111
I am so sick of you
and everyone else

14:54.145 --> 14:56.045
Telling me what I'm
supposed to do.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.547
You don't decide
what's best for me,

14:57.581 --> 14:58.581
And you sure as hell

14:58.615 --> 15:01.283
Don't decide what
is best for Aiden!

15:01.317 --> 15:02.517
I decide.

15:02.552 --> 15:04.519
Do you understand me? Me!

15:04.554 --> 15:05.920
Now go get a life of your own.

15:05.955 --> 15:07.889
Better yet, a death of your
own, and leave me alone!

15:07.923 --> 15:09.757
Do you understand?

15:09.791 --> 15:11.558
I just asked you a question.

15:11.592 --> 15:14.193
Do you understand?

15:21.434 --> 15:23.603
Please, please, can you help me?

15:23.637 --> 15:24.937
I'm trying to find my doctor.

15:24.972 --> 15:26.338
I don't know what's
happening to me.

15:26.373 --> 15:28.206
Look, I'm not in the
mood for this right now.

15:28.241 --> 15:29.841
Just look for a light.
Get the hell in it.

15:29.875 --> 15:32.543
Stay in it, problem solved.

15:32.577 --> 15:35.378
Wha...I...I...

15:35.412 --> 15:37.180
You're not dead, are you?

15:37.214 --> 15:39.114
Mr. Fordyce, come on. Time to go
now, sir. Let's go. Right this way.

15:39.149 --> 15:41.782
Why does she think I'm dead?
Do I look th bad?

15:41.817 --> 15:45.120
You're annoying more
people here than I am.

15:45.154 --> 15:46.855
You know, this whole thing with
your little posse has to stop.

15:46.889 --> 15:47.922
Who are those kids, anyway?

15:47.957 --> 15:49.924
They're like my army.

15:49.959 --> 15:52.092
They do whatever I say.

15:52.127 --> 15:54.061
And I keep them safe.

15:54.095 --> 15:55.562
The safest place for
you is in the light.

15:56.564 --> 15:57.897
You're funny.

15:57.931 --> 15:59.532
Hey, how come you're
the only one of them

15:59.566 --> 16:00.666
Who can see us?

16:00.701 --> 16:03.268
Ahem. Them who?

16:03.303 --> 16:04.703
The people on the other side.

16:04.737 --> 16:06.337
The breathers.

16:06.372 --> 16:07.905
That's what we call you people.

16:07.939 --> 16:10.740
Charming. Now what about
your parents? Where are they?

16:10.775 --> 16:12.676
They were so sad
when they lost me.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.611
They cried,

16:14.645 --> 16:15.912
And they cried...

16:15.946 --> 16:17.246
Don't you think they'd be
happier if you crossed over

16:17.281 --> 16:18.514
Instead of staying
here, causing trouble?

16:18.549 --> 16:22.251
If you could get my parents
to come and talk to me,

16:22.285 --> 16:24.019
I'd do whatever they wanted.

16:24.053 --> 16:26.287
Where can I find them?

16:26.322 --> 16:27.588
My dad owns the gas
station in town.

16:27.623 --> 16:29.123
You should be careful, though.

16:29.157 --> 16:31.892
He doesn't like to
talk about losing me.

16:31.926 --> 16:33.159
It hurts his heart.

16:33.194 --> 16:36.228
It's not my first barbecue.
I'll try not to upset him.

16:47.171 --> 16:48.672
Yeah, you're about a quart low.

16:48.706 --> 16:51.240
Well, maybe that's what my
car's been trying to tell me.

16:51.274 --> 16:52.808
Yeah.

16:52.842 --> 16:57.245
You almost gotta be a computer
genius to own a car today.

16:57.279 --> 16:59.013
You know, it used to be fun.

16:59.047 --> 17:00.514
You know, figuring
out what was wrong.

17:00.548 --> 17:02.949
But now I just OK at a screen.

17:04.317 --> 17:06.019
I've seen you around town, right?

17:06.053 --> 17:08.954
Yeah, I own the antiques
store down the street.

17:08.989 --> 17:12.357
Oh, yeah. Yeah, my
wife loves that place.

17:12.392 --> 17:14.159
You've got more of
my money than I do.

17:15.961 --> 17:17.595
Look, I don't want to pry,

17:17.628 --> 17:20.530
But I was wondering if we
could talk about your son.

17:20.564 --> 17:23.967
My son? Yeah, your boy.

17:24.001 --> 17:27.403
Yeah, my wife and
I can't have kids.

17:27.436 --> 17:30.039
What's, uh, what's this about?

17:30.073 --> 17:33.574
I'm sorry, I thought you
had a son named Pete.

17:33.609 --> 17:36.710
Pete's not my son.

17:36.744 --> 17:38.145
But you know him?

17:38.179 --> 17:41.113
Who are you? Huh?

17:41.148 --> 17:42.348
Did they send you here?

17:42.382 --> 17:44.316
What's he done now?

17:44.350 --> 17:46.518
They? I don't... we want nothing

17:46.552 --> 17:49.120
To do with that kid.
Do you understand?

17:49.154 --> 17:53.289
So you're not aware
that Pete passed away?

18:02.298 --> 18:05.066
I don't want to
talk to you anymore.

18:05.100 --> 18:06.500
Um, oil's on the house.

18:06.534 --> 18:08.567
His name was Pete Murphy.

18:08.602 --> 18:10.969
He died at the
hospital last month.

18:11.003 --> 18:13.439
Hodgkin's disease. He was 13.

18:13.474 --> 18:14.739
Ugh, poor kid.

18:14.774 --> 18:16.141
And the records said
that he was sent to us

18:16.175 --> 18:17.842
From the Driscoll
county youth home.

18:17.877 --> 18:20.244
So he was an orphan?
Yeah. Which means

18:20.279 --> 18:22.379
This is another haunting
involving orphans.

18:22.414 --> 18:24.948
So it's probably shadow related?

18:24.983 --> 18:26.183
Makes perfect sense.

18:26.217 --> 18:27.417
I mean, what kids
are more vulnerable

18:27.452 --> 18:28.849
Than those with no families?

18:28.884 --> 18:30.283
And I can't reunite
them with anyone.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.818
Now you said there were
a lot of other kids?

18:31.852 --> 18:34.120
Yeah, he said he was
trying to keep them safe.

18:34.154 --> 18:35.888
Huh. From the shadows?

18:35.922 --> 18:39.224
Well, we know that they
like to take ghost children,

18:39.259 --> 18:40.826
So probably. And the
guy that I met today,

18:40.860 --> 18:43.761
It seemed like he was maybe a foster
parent of Pete's at some point,

18:43.796 --> 18:45.563
And it didn't work out so well.

18:45.597 --> 18:47.865
So I guess Pete just
created an image

18:47.900 --> 18:49.967
Of loving parents in his mind.

18:50.002 --> 18:53.271
Makes you want to count
your blessings, huh?

18:53.305 --> 18:54.873
Uh-huh. Yeah.

18:54.907 --> 18:57.075
I'm gonna go there tomorrow
and see if I can find out.

18:57.109 --> 18:59.244
Good.

18:59.278 --> 19:00.946
Oh, hey, don't take a
shower tomorrow morning.

19:00.980 --> 19:02.714
The drain's still
clogged, it's nasty.

19:02.748 --> 19:04.381
I mention this only for
informational purposes, not to...

19:04.415 --> 19:05.882
Yeah, I know.

19:05.916 --> 19:08.651
Plumber told me he's going to have
to come back again tomorrow, so.

19:18.660 --> 19:20.960
I thought I saw my
soldier under here.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.495
But it was just this.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.097
What are you doing up so late?

19:25.131 --> 19:27.432
I gotta find him, mom.
He was the general.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.000
Enough with the soldier already.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.435
And if I find you
out of bed again,

19:30.469 --> 19:31.770
I'm gonna take all
the soldiers away.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.305
Do you understand me, mister?

19:33.339 --> 19:35.273
Now get in the bed and don't move!

19:36.475 --> 19:39.544
It's all right, buddy. Ahem.

19:40.946 --> 19:42.446
Your mom's under a lot
of stress right now,

19:42.481 --> 19:44.980
So, um...go to bed,

19:45.015 --> 19:46.947
I'm sorry, dad.

19:47.849 --> 19:50.283
It's OK. Just get some sleep.

20:34.100 --> 20:34.899
***

20:34.900 --> 20:37.859
Yeah, I remember
Pete. Pistol Pete.

20:37.860 --> 20:39.845
He was a force of nature.

20:39.850 --> 20:41.450
He was a problem for you?

20:41.485 --> 20:43.353
Oh, yeah. For everyone.

20:43.387 --> 20:45.221
But you had to love him.

20:45.255 --> 20:46.722
And I did.

20:46.756 --> 20:49.492
He was always riling
up all the kids.

20:49.526 --> 20:51.798
Starting protests about the food,

20:51.833 --> 20:53.499
TV rebellions.

20:53.534 --> 20:55.234
The kids all loved him

20:55.268 --> 20:57.501
Because he made
them feel important.

20:57.535 --> 21:00.002
Like what they wanted mattered.

21:00.037 --> 21:01.437
At least one family adopted him.

21:01.471 --> 21:03.071
More than one.

21:03.105 --> 21:04.539
But it was always the same story.

21:04.573 --> 21:06.173
I mean, he'd get
placed in a family

21:06.207 --> 21:08.007
And within a month, he'd
end up right back here.

21:08.042 --> 21:10.008
He was just too much to handle.

21:10.043 --> 21:12.210
And then he got sick?

21:12.244 --> 21:13.411
Yeah.

21:13.445 --> 21:16.079
They tried to take
care of him here,

21:16.114 --> 21:20.282
But eventually we had to
put him in the hospital.

21:22.219 --> 21:25.655
He was very alone in
the world, pistol Pete.

21:26.990 --> 21:28.624
What about his birth mother?

21:28.658 --> 21:32.064
Well, she gave him up
the day he was born.

21:32.098 --> 21:34.868
And she never looked back.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.203
I really can't...

21:36.237 --> 21:38.638
Can you just tell me
where he was born?

21:38.672 --> 21:41.206
Same place he died.

21:41.241 --> 21:43.375
Rockland memorial.

21:43.409 --> 21:47.211
This is the toughest
case I've ever seen.

21:47.245 --> 21:48.879
Whatever's in there...

21:48.913 --> 21:50.246
What is so hard
about this, George?

21:50.281 --> 21:52.081
I thought clogs
were your specialty.

21:52.115 --> 21:54.816
Well, I think I may have met
my Waterloo on this one.

21:54.850 --> 21:56.951
Is that supposed to be
another plumber joke?

21:56.986 --> 22:00.021
I guess it could be. Water. Loo.

22:00.055 --> 22:01.522
Just unclog the drain.

22:01.557 --> 22:03.691
You're George the plumber,
not George the comedian.

22:03.725 --> 22:07.060
Ok. This is war!

22:07.094 --> 22:09.428
I will win!

22:36.600 --> 22:38.834
There was a polio ward for kids.

22:38.869 --> 22:41.170
And the doctor there who
gave them Halloween masks

22:41.204 --> 22:43.005
Let them play tricks
on the other patients.

22:43.039 --> 22:44.639
I guess it was to let
them have some fun.

22:44.674 --> 22:46.107
Yeah. When did it close?

22:46.141 --> 22:47.440
1930s.

22:47.474 --> 22:49.408
That's when they must have
built the second floor

22:49.442 --> 22:51.242
And the pediatric ward up there.

22:51.276 --> 22:52.976
So where is the old one?

22:53.011 --> 22:55.046
You know, there's an abandoned
wing of the hospital

22:55.080 --> 22:56.181
Down in the subbasement.

22:56.215 --> 22:58.049
I've never seen it;
I've only heard about it.

22:58.083 --> 22:59.918
Everybody kind of
steers clear of it.

22:59.952 --> 23:02.453
Everybody, except, of course,
for maybe, right, you.

23:02.488 --> 23:05.023
Look, I can show it to you, but I've
got to do some rounds right now.

23:05.058 --> 23:06.291
Well, just point me in
the right direction.

23:06.326 --> 23:07.626
The meter's running
on our baby-sitter.

23:07.660 --> 23:09.928
All right. First
right, down the stairs.

23:09.962 --> 23:11.729
Ok. See ya.

24:21.125 --> 24:23.658
Don't you know you're dead?

24:23.692 --> 24:25.493
I beg your pardon?

24:25.527 --> 24:27.194
We're not scared of you.

24:27.228 --> 24:29.727
We know you can't hurt us.

24:29.761 --> 24:31.527
Why would I want to hurt you?

24:31.561 --> 24:33.462
It's OK.

24:33.497 --> 24:36.431
She's just one of the breathers.

24:37.700 --> 24:40.301
She thinks she's alive.

24:43.070 --> 24:44.937
Welcome to my lair.

24:44.971 --> 24:47.772
I've always wanted to have a lair.

24:47.806 --> 24:49.273
What's going on with
you and these kids?

24:49.307 --> 24:51.341
I made them all
believe they're alive.

24:51.375 --> 24:54.043
They think the doctors and
nurses are the ghosts.

24:54.077 --> 24:57.380
And now, you.

24:57.414 --> 24:58.448
Why?

24:58.482 --> 25:00.349
I want them to feel
like they're important.

25:00.384 --> 25:04.185
Let them feel what it's
like to have some juice.

25:04.220 --> 25:05.386
This is wrong.

25:05.421 --> 25:06.587
I know you mean well,

25:06.621 --> 25:08.389
But you're not helping
them like this.

25:08.423 --> 25:09.656
They need to cross
over, and so do you.

25:09.691 --> 25:11.358
I protect them.

25:11.392 --> 25:12.926
From the shadows?

25:14.028 --> 25:15.595
The cold things.

25:15.629 --> 25:18.097
They want us.

25:18.131 --> 25:19.999
If it wasn't for
me, they would have

25:20.033 --> 25:22.665
Taken everybody here already.

25:22.700 --> 25:24.499
And how do you keep them safe?

25:24.533 --> 25:26.133
I teach them not to be afraid.

25:26.168 --> 25:29.068
That's why we march
around the hospital

25:29.103 --> 25:31.303
Twice a day, every
day. We show them

25:31.338 --> 25:33.439
Who's boss. This is more dangerous

25:33.473 --> 25:35.474
Than you know, Pete.

25:35.508 --> 25:36.909
Especially for you.

25:36.943 --> 25:38.644
Look, we don't know why,

25:38.678 --> 25:41.079
But the shadows, they
go after ghost children.

25:41.113 --> 25:42.480
I know your story.

25:42.514 --> 25:43.748
I've been to the youth home,

25:43.782 --> 25:45.082
I know that they kept
sending you back.

25:45.117 --> 25:46.751
I know how painful
it must be to...

25:46.785 --> 25:49.053
No, you don't.

25:49.087 --> 25:52.990
How would you like it
if nobody wanted you?

25:53.024 --> 25:56.892
If all anybody ever saw
was the bad in you,

25:56.927 --> 25:59.995
And they couldn't wait
to get rid of you.

26:00.029 --> 26:01.296
I'm no good.

26:01.331 --> 26:04.299
That's why nobody wants me.

26:04.333 --> 26:06.401
You're not bad. That's not...

26:06.435 --> 26:07.936
Even my own mother didn't want me.

26:07.970 --> 26:09.371
You don't know that.

26:09.405 --> 26:12.373
You think I couldn't
break into file cabinets?

26:12.407 --> 26:14.408
I know.

26:19.180 --> 26:20.447
Oh.

26:20.481 --> 26:22.348
I got you.

26:22.383 --> 26:23.916
Again.

26:23.951 --> 26:25.451
Nobody loves me.

26:25.485 --> 26:27.052
Boo-hoo-hoo.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.252
Poor me.

26:28.286 --> 26:31.885
This is my family now.

26:31.920 --> 26:33.519
They're never going
to send me back.

26:33.554 --> 26:36.321
We're never going to split up.

26:36.356 --> 26:39.622
This is our hospital!

27:08.400 --> 27:10.501
Did you get the book...

27:10.536 --> 27:11.936
Sorry.

27:11.971 --> 27:14.239
Did you get the book from Ned?

27:15.475 --> 27:17.509
You look terrible.

27:17.550 --> 27:20.584
By the way, I noticed that
dentist had hairy arms.

27:20.619 --> 27:23.154
Just an observation.
Well, chalk up

27:23.188 --> 27:25.056
Another advantage to being dead.

27:25.090 --> 27:27.358
No dental work and
no more flossing.

27:27.392 --> 27:29.526
Ok, the book. Let's see.

27:39.834 --> 27:40.199
***

27:40.200 --> 27:43.201
Please, what do I have to
do to convince you people?

27:43.236 --> 27:44.970
Do you want me to recount

27:45.004 --> 27:47.339
Every embarrassing
thing I know about you

27:47.373 --> 27:48.974
That the shadows couldn't?

27:49.008 --> 27:52.377
Like the time I came to talk to
you and you were on that website?

27:52.411 --> 27:54.746
Ok.

27:54.781 --> 27:56.348
All right.

27:56.382 --> 27:58.216
See if you can find anything
in the book that can help us.

27:58.251 --> 28:00.185
New things, added things.

28:00.219 --> 28:03.020
What I think is
happening is this...

28:03.055 --> 28:05.823
The shadows want
Melinda and Aiden,

28:05.858 --> 28:08.493
But for some reason, they're
leaving Aiden alone.

28:08.527 --> 28:12.163
Which makes me wonder if this has
something to do with the shinies.

28:12.197 --> 28:14.098
The shinies are drawn

28:14.133 --> 28:15.466
To Aiden for some reason,

28:15.501 --> 28:17.502
And the shadows hate them.

28:17.536 --> 28:21.038
If we only knew what or who

28:21.073 --> 28:23.574
The shinies really are,

28:23.609 --> 28:26.777
Then maybe we could enlist
them to protect Melinda.

28:26.812 --> 28:29.213
It's only a matter of time
before Melinda's weak enough

28:29.247 --> 28:32.416
For the shadows to
control her completely.

28:32.450 --> 28:35.351
And where will that leave Aiden?

28:35.386 --> 28:37.487
What?

28:43.093 --> 28:46.530
"and the darkness will come

28:46.564 --> 28:48.365
"and swallow them all,

28:48.399 --> 28:50.367
"unless the family of light

28:50.401 --> 28:53.103
Turns night into day."

28:53.137 --> 28:55.205
Well, we're going to sit
down for dinner now,

28:55.239 --> 28:57.306
So if you're not done, you
can just finish tomorrow.

28:57.341 --> 29:00.444
No, no, I'm almost
done, I promise.

29:00.478 --> 29:03.281
I will be victorious.

29:03.315 --> 29:05.650
Anyway.

29:05.684 --> 29:07.651
I think this is my only
chance to cross Pete over.

29:07.685 --> 29:09.819
Honey, you are never going
to find the birth mother.

29:09.853 --> 29:11.887
Those records are sealed.

29:11.921 --> 29:14.228
Not even the adopted
family can get into them.

29:14.250 --> 29:15.349
Sometimes the impossible

29:15.384 --> 29:16.450
Just takes a little bit longer.

29:16.485 --> 29:18.117
Hmm. I just wish I
could explain this

29:18.118 --> 29:19.598
To his birth mother.

29:19.600 --> 29:20.833
If she came with me to see Pete

29:20.867 --> 29:23.068
And told him that she
loved him and wanted him

29:23.102 --> 29:24.902
And why she couldn't
have kept him,

29:24.936 --> 29:26.542
If she just told him the
reasons for letting him go,

29:26.543 --> 29:28.615
I know that he would cross over.

29:28.616 --> 29:30.697
Honey, you've got a big heart.

29:30.698 --> 29:33.255
I know you want a happy
ending for this boy.

29:33.256 --> 29:34.692
But didn't the orphanage
tell you straight out

29:34.693 --> 29:36.752
That the mother
didn't even want him?

29:37.084 --> 29:40.066
If you find her, what, do
you want her to lie to him?

29:40.067 --> 29:41.843
If it makes him feel loved?

29:42.037 --> 29:43.308
Yes.

29:45.419 --> 29:46.571
Are you even going to touch this?

29:46.572 --> 29:48.329
I just don't feel well.

29:49.750 --> 29:51.751
Wow. You're burning up.

29:51.785 --> 29:52.563
Let me take your temperature.

29:52.564 --> 29:53.565
No, no, no, I'm fine.

29:53.566 --> 29:56.147
As soon as George is done
upstairs I'm gonna go to bed.

29:56.148 --> 29:57.680
You know, I'm so
over this plumber.

29:57.681 --> 29:59.758
Where did you find him, anyway?

29:59.759 --> 30:00.854
I thought you found him.

30:00.855 --> 30:01.911
I thought you called him.

30:01.912 --> 30:02.725
I never called any plumber.

30:02.726 --> 30:03.895
You said you were
going to call him.

30:03.896 --> 30:05.850
I've never even seen this guy.

30:10.500 --> 30:11.733
You're dead!

30:11.767 --> 30:13.434
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

30:13.469 --> 30:15.202
You totally took advantage of me.

30:15.236 --> 30:16.436
How do you know that I can't tell

30:16.470 --> 30:17.803
The dead from the
living right now?

30:17.837 --> 30:19.540
Word gets around.

30:19.574 --> 30:22.444
There's more gossip than you
might think on the other side.

30:22.478 --> 30:24.312
The dead should be above
that kind of thing.

30:24.346 --> 30:25.780
I'm sorry.

30:25.814 --> 30:28.482
Look, I'm just so happy
to have a job again.

30:28.516 --> 30:29.750
I love my work.

30:29.784 --> 30:31.684
But you can't
actually do anything.

30:31.719 --> 30:34.253
Well, pretty much the
same as when I was alive.

30:34.288 --> 30:36.055
Get out! Just get out!

30:36.089 --> 30:37.423
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

30:37.457 --> 30:39.725
Look, I'm sorry to
have wasted your time.

30:39.759 --> 30:42.026
Let me try to make it up to you.

30:49.501 --> 30:52.335
I hope that helps!

30:55.439 --> 30:57.373
I'm worried about my mom.

30:57.407 --> 30:59.542
There's something
not right with her.

30:59.576 --> 31:02.678
I see lots of shadows around her.

31:02.713 --> 31:05.381
Why can't you guys make the
shadows leave my mom alone?

31:05.415 --> 31:07.216
We're too scared of them.

31:07.250 --> 31:10.119
They're really mean.

31:12.622 --> 31:13.921
Whom were you talking to?

31:13.955 --> 31:16.387
A ghost. Don't tell my mom.

31:16.422 --> 31:17.854
I won't.

31:17.889 --> 31:18.889
But if you were
talking to a ghost,

31:18.923 --> 31:20.590
How come I couldn't see it?

31:20.625 --> 31:21.925
It was my friend Cassidy.

31:21.960 --> 31:25.095
She crossed over, and
now she's a shiny.

31:25.129 --> 31:26.595
That's who shinies are?

31:26.630 --> 31:29.698
Crossed over spirits
of children? Mm-hmm.

31:29.732 --> 31:30.799
No wonder the shadows

31:30.833 --> 31:33.234
Are so interested in child ghosts.

31:33.269 --> 31:34.969
The shinies are
scared of the shadows,

31:35.004 --> 31:36.838
But they don't have to be.

31:36.872 --> 31:37.872
Why not?

31:37.906 --> 31:40.742
There are way more
shinies than shadows.

31:40.776 --> 31:43.711
If they ever had a war,
the shinies would win.

31:43.745 --> 31:45.246
Aiden, that's...

31:45.280 --> 31:47.448
Shh.

31:49.618 --> 31:51.152
Ok.

31:51.186 --> 31:52.786
Found this in the drain.

31:52.820 --> 31:55.321
Wow, thanks!

31:55.355 --> 31:57.022
Keep track of your
toys in the tub, OK?

31:57.057 --> 31:58.824
Lucky break that I didn't
have to pay a plumber

31:58.859 --> 32:00.259
To come and get that out.

32:00.293 --> 32:02.726
Ok, mom.

32:14.904 --> 32:16.104
Hey, I think I found something.

32:16.139 --> 32:17.172
Oh, yeah?

32:17.206 --> 32:18.874
Says here there's a
woman who gave birth

32:18.908 --> 32:20.609
On the same day
that Pete was born.

32:20.643 --> 32:23.576
And then she gave the baby
up for adoption on the spot

32:23.610 --> 32:25.275
And left the hospital.
It was pre-arranged.

32:25.309 --> 32:27.675
Is there a name and an address?

32:27.709 --> 32:29.343
The last name and
address are blacked out.

32:29.378 --> 32:30.710
It just says "Joan."

32:30.744 --> 32:32.277
Hold on.

32:32.311 --> 32:35.543
Ah, look, business
address and occupation.

32:35.577 --> 32:37.178
She owned a beauty salon.

32:37.212 --> 32:39.279
But that was 13 years ago.

32:39.314 --> 32:41.381
Hey, it's worth a shot.

32:41.415 --> 32:45.117
Look, I'm going to start by saying
that I have no right to be here,

32:45.152 --> 32:46.852
And I've probably
broken a couple of laws

32:46.886 --> 32:48.487
Just finding you.

32:48.521 --> 32:50.055
But I need your help.

32:50.089 --> 32:52.090
You don't look like you
need a haircut that bad.

32:52.124 --> 32:55.693
Or are you going to tell
me I have 6 months to live?

32:55.727 --> 32:59.062
Did you give a child
up for adoption

32:59.096 --> 33:01.930
January 18th, 1997,

33:01.964 --> 33:04.799
Rockland memorial hospital?

33:05.934 --> 33:07.969
Who are you?

33:08.003 --> 33:10.371
I know this must be a shock to
you, but please, just hear me out.

33:10.405 --> 33:12.006
What do you want?

33:12.040 --> 33:14.408
If I were to tell you that
you have an opportunity

33:14.442 --> 33:15.875
To help this child right now,

33:15.910 --> 33:17.277
Would you take it?

33:17.311 --> 33:18.778
And I'm not talking
about taking custody,

33:18.812 --> 33:19.979
Or taking responsibility.

33:20.013 --> 33:21.414
I'm not talking about money.

33:21.448 --> 33:22.614
But it would require

33:22.649 --> 33:24.683
A pretty big leap of
faith on your part.

33:24.717 --> 33:25.950
Is...

33:25.985 --> 33:28.052
Is she in some kind of
trouble or something?

33:28.087 --> 33:30.287
No, no, not...

33:30.322 --> 33:32.189
Did you say, "she"?

33:32.223 --> 33:35.158
Yes. Aren't we talking
about my daughter?

33:35.192 --> 33:37.427
The child you gave up was a girl?

33:38.728 --> 33:40.829
I am really sorry.

33:40.863 --> 33:42.831
I have the wrong person.

33:42.865 --> 33:46.634
I...I'm so sorry.

33:46.668 --> 33:49.737
Wait.

33:49.771 --> 33:51.838
I don't know why I'm
telling you this,

33:51.873 --> 33:56.108
Except...you seem like you're
really trying to help someone.

33:56.143 --> 33:58.277
I am. Well, we are. My wife and I.

33:58.311 --> 34:00.478
There was a woman in the
same room with me that day.

34:00.513 --> 34:03.047
She gave birth 2 hours before me.

34:03.081 --> 34:04.348
A boy.

34:04.383 --> 34:06.817
And did she... and she died

34:06.851 --> 34:09.719
While giving birth.
There was no family,

34:09.754 --> 34:11.888
No one came, so the
state took custody,

34:11.922 --> 34:14.591
And the baby was sent to the
same orphanage as my little girl,

34:14.625 --> 34:16.993
On the same day.

34:17.027 --> 34:19.496
That's all I remember.

34:20.797 --> 34:23.600
Pete's mother did not give
him up for adoption, Mel.

34:23.634 --> 34:25.802
There must have been a
records mix-up later on.

34:25.835 --> 34:27.737
She died giving birth.

34:27.771 --> 34:30.172
She had no family, and there was
no one to take care of Pete.

34:30.206 --> 34:33.275
So the state put
him in an orphanage.

34:33.310 --> 34:35.811
Listen to what else.
She was sick, right?

34:35.846 --> 34:37.346
There was a dangerous pregnancy.

34:37.380 --> 34:38.813
She told the doctors straight up

34:38.849 --> 34:40.416
That if anything
bad were to happen,

34:40.449 --> 34:41.684
They should save Pete,

34:41.719 --> 34:43.820
Even if it meant letting her die.

34:43.853 --> 34:46.422
So not only did she
not give him up,

34:46.456 --> 34:49.759
She sacrificed her life for his.

34:49.793 --> 34:51.561
Ok, well, that's good to know,

34:51.594 --> 34:53.228
Thanks for telling me.

34:54.431 --> 34:56.130
Well, I thought that this
would make you happy...

34:56.166 --> 34:58.700
I gotta go.

35:05.640 --> 35:07.640
Melinda?

35:07.674 --> 35:10.209
Melinda's not here.

35:27.962 --> 35:30.230
Want to play chess?

35:30.264 --> 35:32.432
Hmm. Maybe later.

35:32.466 --> 35:34.834
Right now we need to
talk about your mom.

35:37.337 --> 35:39.771
She's in trouble.

35:39.806 --> 35:41.940
She needs help, or she...

35:41.974 --> 35:46.945
Well, she may not ever
be the same again.

35:47.980 --> 35:50.248
What kind of help? Do you remember

35:50.282 --> 35:51.750
When you said if there was
a war with the shadows,

35:51.784 --> 35:53.452
The shinies would win?

35:53.486 --> 35:54.419
Mm-hmm.

35:54.454 --> 35:56.655
Well, it's time for that war.

35:56.689 --> 35:59.290
But the shinies need a leader;
a general,

35:59.325 --> 36:02.395
Someone who was meant
to bring them together.

36:02.429 --> 36:04.431
Someone like you.

36:06.835 --> 36:08.702
Why me?

36:08.736 --> 36:12.605
I think it's what the
book is trying to tell us.

36:12.639 --> 36:15.274
And the shinies are all children.

36:15.308 --> 36:18.477
Who better to lead them than you?

36:18.511 --> 36:20.946
Well, what if I'm scared?

36:20.980 --> 36:23.349
What if I'm not brave enough?

36:24.622 --> 36:27.122
Even brave people get scared.

36:27.156 --> 36:30.225
Do you think your mom's
not scared sometimes?

36:30.259 --> 36:32.362
She is.

36:32.396 --> 36:34.265
So am I.

36:34.299 --> 36:36.967
But what makes a person brave

36:37.001 --> 36:40.436
Is not letting their
fears stop them.

36:42.304 --> 36:45.138
Tell me what I have to do.

36:54.744 --> 36:56.411
Jim, something's
wrong with Melinda.

36:56.445 --> 36:57.745
She's locked herself in the store.

36:57.779 --> 37:00.211
She won't answer the phone,
she won't talk to anyone.

37:00.246 --> 37:01.644
Dad?

37:01.678 --> 37:03.612
You need to take
me to where mom is,

37:03.647 --> 37:07.046
Or something really bad
is going to happen to her.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.216
Aiden.

37:18.217 --> 37:20.276
Aiden! Aiden!

37:20.277 --> 37:22.836
Wait here, dad, I have
to do this myself.

37:24.800 --> 37:27.500
Mom?

37:29.637 --> 37:31.060
I am not your mother.

37:31.100 --> 37:33.369
I know that, and I want her back.

37:33.370 --> 37:36.406
I'm giving you one more
chance to leave her alone.

37:37.306 --> 37:38.977
We're busy.

37:45.618 --> 37:47.322
Look, Aiden...hey.

37:47.356 --> 37:49.859
It's all right, dad.
I know what to do.

37:54.200 --> 37:57.591
Cassidy, Cassidy!

37:57.592 --> 37:59.456
Cassidy!

38:00.500 --> 38:03.319
I need all the shinies
to come, right now.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.415
They're too afraid.

38:05.416 --> 38:06.616
I'm too afraid.

38:06.617 --> 38:09.915
It's a school play,
and he's rehearsing.

38:09.916 --> 38:13.250
It's OK. We're going to make
the shadows go away forever.

38:13.285 --> 38:14.485
Right now.

38:14.519 --> 38:15.937
How?

38:15.938 --> 38:18.221
We're going to turn
night into day.

38:21.191 --> 38:22.624
Take my hand.

38:29.300 --> 38:31.167
That makes me feel strong.

38:31.201 --> 38:34.336
You are strong. Hold
out your other hand.

39:16.467 --> 39:19.503
How can a local
school afford that?

39:54.066 --> 39:56.468
Wow.

40:04.141 --> 40:06.575
Melinda!

40:06.609 --> 40:08.777
Hey, baby. Hey,
baby, you all right?

40:08.811 --> 40:10.212
I'm fine. Ok.

40:10.246 --> 40:12.380
Where's Aiden?

40:21.723 --> 40:23.790
Oh, baby.

40:23.824 --> 40:25.625
You are my hero.

40:25.659 --> 40:29.296
You're my hero.

40:31.365 --> 40:35.064
Mommy's all right now, you
made the shadows let go of me.

40:40.736 --> 40:42.336
I love you, mommy.

40:57.149 --> 40:59.918
My mother wanted me?

40:59.952 --> 41:02.253
So much that she told the doctor

41:02.287 --> 41:04.888
If he could only save
one of you, to save you.

41:05.790 --> 41:09.093
She gave her life for yours.

41:09.127 --> 41:12.062
That's how much you were loved.

41:14.098 --> 41:16.699
It's time to cross over
now, you don't belong here.

41:18.368 --> 41:21.036
I can't just leave them.

41:21.070 --> 41:24.972
They're still my family.

41:25.007 --> 41:28.072
So, just take them with you.

41:28.106 --> 41:30.607
And you can all stay together.

41:31.809 --> 41:33.776
Yeah, but...

41:33.810 --> 41:36.745
They're gonna know I lied
about them not being dead.

41:36.779 --> 41:39.280
They'll know that you
care about how they felt.

41:39.315 --> 41:42.116
That's all that will matter.

41:50.223 --> 41:53.258
I see it.

42:01.631 --> 42:04.432
It's so bright.

42:18.641 --> 42:20.841
Your mom's probably there.

42:20.875 --> 42:23.474
Waiting for you.

42:27.475 --> 42:30.609
She looks just like me.

42:55.672 --> 42:57.654
Your mother and I want you to know

42:58.031 --> 43:00.330
That you were right not
to give up on our gift.

43:00.331 --> 43:01.691
It's who you are,

43:01.692 --> 43:04.446
And it's who your mother
is, and we should never...

43:04.879 --> 43:07.849
I should never deny that again.

43:07.850 --> 43:10.140
We call it a gift for a reason.

43:10.141 --> 43:13.214
It allows us to be able
to help people in ways...

43:13.215 --> 43:16.621
In ways that others can't.

43:16.948 --> 43:19.123
And we have to respect that.

43:19.124 --> 43:20.925
Learn from it.

43:20.926 --> 43:22.562
Take care of it.

43:22.563 --> 43:25.261
And never hide it from
each other again, OK?

43:25.262 --> 43:26.971
Deal?

43:28.522 --> 43:30.462
Deal.

43:31.535 --> 43:32.970
Good night, son.

43:37.006 --> 43:39.140
I meant what I said, you know.

43:39.902 --> 43:42.643
You were my hero tonight.

43:43.357 --> 43:45.342
Just like you are, mom.

43:45.343 --> 43:47.724
Every day.
