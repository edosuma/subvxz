00:01.800 --> 00:06.396
- Previously on Hannibal:
- My palace is vast, even
by medieval standards.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.658
- The foyer is the Norman
Chapel in Palermo.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.702
Severe, beautiful, and timeless.

00:10.740 --> 00:13.208
- You come to Palermo, and soon,

00:13.240 --> 00:15.731
a body is discovered.
- A valentine written

00:15.780 --> 00:18.340
on a broken man.
There are places

00:18.380 --> 00:21.042
within himself
he can't safely go.

00:21.080 --> 00:24.117
Have you ever been a father?
- I was to my sister.

00:24.150 --> 00:27.779
Her name was Mischa.
- Hannibal!

00:27.820 --> 00:32.029
And I forgive you.

00:53.180 --> 00:55.171
- Was it nice to see him?

00:57.790 --> 00:59.678
- It was nice...

00:59.720 --> 01:03.759
among other things.

01:06.260 --> 01:08.125
He knew where to look for me.

01:12.770 --> 01:15.136
- You knew where
he would look for you.

01:18.140 --> 01:20.108
- He said he forgave me.

01:20.140 --> 01:23.109
- Forgiveness is too great

01:23.150 --> 01:25.539
and difficult for one person.

01:25.580 --> 01:28.777
It requires two:

01:28.820 --> 01:31.709
the betrayer
and the betrayed.

01:34.220 --> 01:37.155
Which one are you?

01:39.300 --> 01:41.359
- I'm vague on those details.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.164
- Betrayal and
forgiveness are...

01:46.340 --> 01:49.161
best seen as something
akin to falling in love.

01:53.380 --> 01:56.178
- You _cannot control
With respect

01:56.210 --> 01:58.178
to whom you fall in love.

02:02.750 --> 02:06.288
- You are going
to be caught.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.221
It has already
been set into motion.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.939
- Is that concern
for your patient

02:19.970 --> 02:21.790
or concern
for yourself?

02:25.240 --> 02:27.276
- I'm not
concerned about me.

02:27.310 --> 02:30.802
I know exactly
how I will navigate

02:30.850 --> 02:33.478
my way out of
whatever it is

02:33.520 --> 02:36.910
I've gotten
myself into.

02:40.490 --> 02:42.856
Do you?

02:42.890 --> 02:45.256
- I did.

02:50.630 --> 02:53.758
- Where will Will Graham
be looking for you next?

02:55.940 --> 02:57.760
- Someplace I can never go.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.647
Home.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.914
(theme music)

06:22.510 --> 06:25.809
- It's not healing to see
your childhood home...

06:25.850 --> 06:27.977
but it helps you measure
whether you are broken...

06:28.020 --> 06:30.443
how and why,

06:30.490 --> 06:33.709
assuming you want to know.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.648
- I want to know.

06:39.130 --> 06:41.621
Is this where
construction began?

06:43.770 --> 06:46.466
- On my memory palace?

06:53.640 --> 06:56.507
Its door at the
center of my mind.

06:56.550 --> 07:00.213
And here you are,
feeling for the latch.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.844
- The spaces in your mind

07:02.890 --> 07:05.939
devoted to your
earliest years...

07:07.790 --> 07:09.621
are they different
than the other rooms?

07:13.600 --> 07:15.420
Are they different
than this room?

07:20.840 --> 07:23.559
- This room holds
sound and motion,

07:23.610 --> 07:27.478
great snakes wrestling
and heaving in the dark.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.906
Other rooms are static scenes,

07:31.950 --> 07:34.839
fragmentary...

07:34.880 --> 07:38.247
like painted shards of glass.

07:38.290 --> 07:42.784
- Everything keyed to memories

07:42.830 --> 07:45.048
leading to...

07:45.090 --> 07:48.491
other memories.

07:48.530 --> 07:50.964
Rooms you...

07:51.000 --> 07:52.797
can't bring
yourself to go.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.889
Nothing escapes from them

07:55.940 --> 07:58.761
that causes you any comfort.

07:58.810 --> 08:02.075
- Screams fill some
of those places,

08:02.110 --> 08:04.249
but the corridors
do not echo screaming...

08:06.620 --> 08:08.247
because I hear music.

08:15.220 --> 08:17.120
(two shots fired)

08:44.920 --> 08:47.286
(wings flapping and single shot)

10:15.210 --> 10:18.247
(harsh thump of the knife)

10:51.810 --> 10:54.870
(rapid chipping of the ice)

11:01.760 --> 11:03.955
The Studiolo is
a small, fierce group.

11:03.990 --> 11:07.096
They have ruined a number
of academic reputations.

11:07.130 --> 11:10.361
- Appearing before
them is a peril.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.267
- You were very eager
to see me discredited,

11:13.300 --> 11:15.860
Professor Sogliato.
- Hm!

11:15.900 --> 11:18.903
You sang for your supper

11:18.940 --> 11:21.875
before the dragons
at the Studiolo.

11:21.910 --> 11:24.299
- And you sang very well.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.717
- Hm!

11:27.750 --> 11:29.843
First, applause,
and then by...

11:29.890 --> 11:33.314
wet eyed
acclamation. Hm!

11:33.360 --> 11:35.851
the memberships affirmed you

11:35.890 --> 11:38.757
as master of Palazzo Capponi.

11:38.790 --> 11:40.849
- Punch Romaine;

11:43.000 --> 11:45.992
a cocktail created
by Escoffier.

11:46.030 --> 11:48.498
_ - Served to
first-class guests

11:48.540 --> 11:51.031
on the Titanic
during their last dinner.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.170
- Hm!

12:02.450 --> 12:05.908
The committees
have a new curator

12:05.950 --> 12:08.783
they do not
miss the old one.

12:08.820 --> 12:11.459
- If my victory pleased

12:11.490 --> 12:13.958
the professo , e
I could not tell.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.457
- Then you weren't
paying attention.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.162
- I pay lots
of attention.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.862
But not in a wide-eyed,
indiscriminate way.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.173
(choking sounds)

12:32.050 --> 12:34.416
(Sigh)

12:34.450 --> 12:36.918
(choking)

12:36.950 --> 12:39.441
That may have been impulsive.

12:39.490 --> 12:41.412
(coughing)

12:41.460 --> 12:43.223
- Been mulling that
impulse ever since

12:43.260 --> 12:46.024
you decided to
serve Punch Romaine.

12:46.060 --> 12:49.518
(sounds uttered as if to talk)

12:49.560 --> 12:52.028
(chuckle)

12:52.070 --> 12:57.064
- I... I can't see.

12:57.110 --> 13:01.228
(a bit of Italian)

13:01.280 --> 13:06.070
(incomprehensible muttering
plus laughing)

13:06.110 --> 13:09.216
(choking and coughing)

13:09.250 --> 13:12.981
(more incomprehensible chatter)

13:13.020 --> 13:15.250
(grunt)

13:19.430 --> 13:22.058
- Technically, you killed him.

13:32.110 --> 13:34.601
- No longer
interested in...

13:34.640 --> 13:36.528
preserving the peace
you found here?

13:38.350 --> 13:41.148
- You cannot
preserve entropy.

13:41.180 --> 13:43.580
It gradually
descends into disorder.

13:43.620 --> 13:47.454
- Two men from
the Capponi are dead.

13:47.490 --> 13:50.459
- I can only claim one...

13:50.490 --> 13:52.924
technically.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.937
- You're drawing them
to you, aren't you?

14:01.940 --> 14:04.465
All of them.

15:22.720 --> 15:25.143
_ - As_with his
crimes In Florence,

15:25.190 --> 15:29.058
il Most_ro collected
anatomical trophies,

15:29.090 --> 15:31.558
but left no evidence.

15:31.590 --> 15:34.627
- Dr. Lecter is careful.

15:34.660 --> 15:37.322
He will strike,

15:37.370 --> 15:39.497
but his needs

15:39.530 --> 15:42.260
don't force him
to strike often.

15:42.300 --> 15:45.303
- There were long periods when
il Mostro didn't strike at all.

15:45.340 --> 15:48.104
_This is the first
in twenty years.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.248
- You have new evidence.

15:52.280 --> 15:55.374
- You know...

15:55.420 --> 15:58.617
the window of the
Questura laboratory

15:58.650 --> 16:01.255
is garlanded
with garlic

16:01.290 --> 16:03.258
to keep out
the evil spirits.

16:03.290 --> 16:05.224
(chuckling)

16:05.260 --> 16:07.728
These are not people
open to new ideas.

16:07.760 --> 16:11.423
My city mocks me.

16:11.470 --> 16:15.463
My hunt for il Mostro has
let the crows peck at my heart.

16:17.540 --> 16:19.531
How is YOUR heart?

16:21.540 --> 16:24.577
- Well pecked.

16:24.610 --> 16:27.647
If he hasn't already,

16:27.680 --> 16:30.285
il Mostro will return

16:30.320 --> 16:32.686
to Florence.

16:35.490 --> 16:37.788
- Come back with me.

16:37.830 --> 16:41.129
We _have a chance
to regain our reputations,

16:41.160 --> 16:43.765
and enjoy the
honors of our trade

16:43.800 --> 16:46.018
by capturing the Monster.

16:46.070 --> 16:49.096
- I'm not here for the Monster.

16:51.510 --> 16:54.479
(Italian words meaning:)

16:54.510 --> 16:56.569
Not my house,

16:56.610 --> 16:58.544
not my fire. I'm here

16:58.580 --> 17:01.743
for Will Graham.

17:17.130 --> 17:19.291
(suspect noise nearby)

19:38.410 --> 19:40.878
(crackling)

19:53.790 --> 19:56.884
(thump)

19:56.920 --> 20:00.720
(door opening)

20:00.760 --> 20:03.422
(door closing)

20:09.500 --> 20:11.604
(door opening)

20:11.640 --> 20:14.973
(door closing)

21:05.530 --> 21:07.293
(scrunching)

21:19.040 --> 21:20.837
(word in foreign language)

21:20.880 --> 21:23.348
(again)

21:23.380 --> 21:25.678
(and again)

21:25.710 --> 21:29.874
(and more again)

21:29.920 --> 21:32.548
(keeps going)

21:36.990 --> 21:39.925
(panﬁng)

21:39.960 --> 21:43.464
(cocking of a gun)

21:43.500 --> 21:46.424
(imprisoned man talking again)

21:53.980 --> 21:56.301
(still talking)

21:58.010 --> 21:59.841
- You're upsetting him.

22:02.520 --> 22:03.919
- You're trespassing.

22:03.950 --> 22:06.817
- I'm a friend of Hannibal's.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.759
- He sent you?

22:12.790 --> 22:16.021
- My name is Will Graham.

22:16.060 --> 22:19.666
I'm unarmed.
May I lower my arms?

22:19.700 --> 22:22.635
- This trigger has
a three-pound pull.

22:22.670 --> 22:26.663
I'm holding two of it.
(foreign language spoken)

22:26.710 --> 22:28.905
- What's he saying?

22:28.940 --> 22:31.500
- He wants you
to look at him,

22:31.550 --> 22:35.418
speak to him, but
you're not going to.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.580
- Ah, you've cast aside

22:41.620 --> 22:43.929
the social graces
normally afforded

22:43.960 --> 22:46.428
to human beings.

22:46.460 --> 22:49.623
- He's cast them aside.

22:49.660 --> 22:53.437
All he's allowed
is the sound of water.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.431
It's what
the unborn hear.

22:59.640 --> 23:03.098
It's their last
memory of peace.

23:03.140 --> 23:05.779
- You're keeping
him like an animal.

23:05.810 --> 23:09.746
- I wouldn't do
this to an animal.

23:33.110 --> 23:36.079
- What did he do?

23:36.110 --> 23:38.476
- He ate her.

23:38.510 --> 23:40.842
- Mischa.

23:46.620 --> 23:48.451
- How long has he
been your prisoner?

23:50.730 --> 23:53.085
- We have been
each other's prisoner...

23:53.130 --> 23:56.019
for a very long time.

24:00.500 --> 24:04.129
- How ever did you find
yourself in this situation?

24:07.840 --> 24:10.741
- That question
applies to both of us.

24:13.520 --> 24:16.045
- And the answer's
probably the same.

24:18.050 --> 24:20.018
What's your name?

24:20.050 --> 24:22.985
- Chiyoh.

24:25.890 --> 24:27.858
How do you know Hannibal?

24:27.900 --> 24:31.267
- One could
argue, intimately.

24:31.300 --> 24:35.088
- Nakama?

24:35.140 --> 24:37.096
It's a Japanese word

24:37.140 --> 24:40.132
for very
close friends.

24:40.170 --> 24:43.549
- Yes, we were nakama.

24:43.580 --> 24:46.799
Last time I saw him, he, uh...

24:46.850 --> 24:49.011
he left me
with a smile.

25:09.640 --> 25:12.234
- All sorrows
can be borne

25:12.270 --> 25:14.932
if you put
them in a story.

25:22.820 --> 25:25.687
Tell me a story.

25:25.720 --> 25:28.280
- In Roman times...

25:28.320 --> 25:30.652
- each carcass was divided:

25:30.690 --> 25:32.885
prime cuts went to nobility,

25:32.930 --> 25:35.899
second to the clergy,

25:35.930 --> 25:38.296
third to the bourgeoisie

25:38.330 --> 25:40.764
and fourth to the army.
The quinto quar - the offal -

25:40.800 --> 25:43.234
went to the poor.
- The fifth quarter?

25:43.270 --> 25:45.830
- The innards of a carcass
constitute roughly

25:45.870 --> 25:48.304
a quarter of its weight.
- El quinto quarto

25:48.340 --> 25:50.740
evolved from necessity

25:50.780 --> 25:52.975
to become high tradition.

25:55.250 --> 25:58.310
(searing and whistling)

26:00.250 --> 26:03.048
- Sibilo caratteristico.

26:03.090 --> 26:06.628
When the lungs whistle,
the dish is done.

26:06.660 --> 26:09.891
- Coratella_
con carCIofi.

26:09.930 --> 26:12.160
Purple artichokes

26:12.200 --> 26:14.134
_served with
spring lamb's liver,

26:14.170 --> 26:15.933
lungs and heart.
- Hm...

26:15.970 --> 26:18.939
Professor Sogliato doesn't
know what he's missing.

26:18.970 --> 26:22.098
_ So rude of him to
ignore your inVItation.

26:22.140 --> 26:24.643
- He sends his regrets.
- Hm.

26:24.680 --> 26:28.377
- (sniffing): Oh madonna .
It smells divine.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.787
- It is! I say that without ego.

26:31.820 --> 26:34.812
I don't require
conventional reinforcement.

26:34.860 --> 26:37.681
(chuckling)
- You would agree,

26:37.730 --> 26:40.255
Signora Fell?
- My husband's ego

26:40.290 --> 26:42.850
is not measured
by conventional means.

26:42.900 --> 26:44.822
- I first prepared
this dish in honor

26:44.870 --> 26:47.691
of my sister
when I was very young.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.958
- I'm sure you've
perfected the recipe

26:50.000 --> 26:52.400
over the years.

26:52.440 --> 26:55.807
(opera playing)

27:12.790 --> 27:14.929
- The meat...
- Ha ha ha!

27:17.100 --> 27:20.729
You have a very good butcher.
- I do indeed.

27:20.770 --> 27:22.761
The lamb must be
newly slaughtered.

27:22.800 --> 27:25.109
The organs cooked
the same day.

27:25.140 --> 27:27.700
I always oversee
this process personally.

27:35.150 --> 27:39.143
- We construct fairy tales
and we accept them.

27:39.190 --> 27:41.454
Our minds

27:41.490 --> 27:43.412
concoct all sorts
of fanta5ies

27:43.460 --> 27:45.621
when we don't want
to believe something.

27:49.500 --> 27:52.799
- I accept what
Hannibal has done.

27:52.830 --> 27:56.129
I understand
why he has done it.

27:56.170 --> 27:59.230
- Mischa doesn't
explain Hannibal.

27:59.270 --> 28:01.101
She doesn't...

28:01.140 --> 28:03.700
quantify what he does.

28:09.150 --> 28:12.119
- How do you know it was your
prisoner who killed Mischa?

28:18.530 --> 28:20.725
- Hannibal told me so.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.724
Hannibal took
someone from you.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.737
Are you here to
take someone from him?

28:35.540 --> 28:38.043
- IfI were
like Hannibal...

28:41.950 --> 28:44.885
...I would've
killed you already.

28:44.920 --> 28:47.787
Cooked you...
ate you...

28:50.290 --> 28:53.020
and fed what was
left of you to him.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.828
That's what he would do.

28:57.870 --> 29:01.499
- You've given
that some thought.

29:05.010 --> 29:06.966
- Do you know
where he is?

29:07.010 --> 29:09.774
- Why are you
looking for him

29:09.810 --> 29:12.176
after he left you

29:12.210 --> 29:14.849
with a smile?

29:20.090 --> 29:22.854
- I've never known myself

29:22.890 --> 29:27.827
as well as I... know myself

29:27.860 --> 29:30.795
when I'm with him.

29:37.040 --> 29:40.009
- You won't find Hannibal here.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.201
There are places
on these grounds

29:42.240 --> 29:44.447
he cannot safely go.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.578
Bad memories.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.839
- What do these grounds
hold for you?

29:51.890 --> 29:56.816
- Hannibal wanted to kill that
man for what he did to Mischa.

29:56.860 --> 29:59.283
I wouldn't let him
take his life,

30:01.460 --> 30:04.361
so Hannibal left
his life with me.

30:09.100 --> 30:11.102
- He was...

30:13.110 --> 30:16.204
curious...
if you would kill.

30:19.050 --> 30:21.416
I imagine he still is.

30:46.470 --> 30:49.234
- What were you like
as a young man?

30:54.480 --> 30:57.119
- I was rooting
for Mephistopheles

30:57.150 --> 30:59.448
and contemptuous of Faust.

31:04.590 --> 31:08.424
- Would you like to talk about
your first spring lamb?

31:10.660 --> 31:12.924
- Would you?

31:17.000 --> 31:19.309
- Why can't you
go home, Hannibal?

31:22.180 --> 31:24.273
What happened to you there?

31:29.520 --> 31:32.148
- Nothing happened to me.

31:32.190 --> 31:35.284
I happened.

31:46.100 --> 31:48.295
- How did your sister taste?

32:08.660 --> 32:10.548
(labored breathing)

32:18.270 --> 32:20.659
(sucking)

32:58.040 --> 33:00.201
(foreign language spoken)

33:00.240 --> 33:03.073
(trembling breath)

33:11.050 --> 33:12.142
(same foreign words)

33:12.190 --> 33:14.317
- Go!

33:42.780 --> 33:45.715
- Are you a believer,
senor Crawford?

33:45.750 --> 33:48.082
- Aren't we all?

33:49.420 --> 33:51.388
Belief comes with imagination.

33:51.430 --> 33:54.228
We also imagine the
possibility that we all...

33:54.260 --> 33:58.492
live on after death.

33:58.530 --> 34:02.398
Will Graham died.

34:02.440 --> 34:05.568
(Spanish words for:)

34:05.610 --> 34:08.704
He was dead. I was dead.

34:08.740 --> 34:11.504
We didn't imagine that.

34:11.550 --> 34:15.509
- What does Will
Graham imagine now?

34:15.550 --> 34:18.383
- I borrowed his imagination...

34:18.420 --> 34:21.787
and I broke it.

34:21.820 --> 34:25.824
I don't know how he managed to
piece it back together again.

34:25.860 --> 34:29.728
- People come here
to be closer to their god.

34:29.760 --> 34:33.196
Isn't that what
Will Graham was doing?

34:33.230 --> 34:36.063
- Maybe.

34:38.240 --> 34:41.368
Will Graham
understands Hannibal.

34:41.410 --> 34:44.277
He accepts him.

34:44.310 --> 34:47.143
Now, who among us doesn't want

34:47.180 --> 34:50.445
understanding and acceptance?

35:29.190 --> 35:31.624
-AH!

35:33.430 --> 35:35.625
(yelping)

35:41.800 --> 35:44.860
(foreign words)

35:44.910 --> 35:46.866
(choked cries)

35:46.910 --> 35:50.437
- I'm sorry.

36:20.910 --> 36:22.832
(grunt and cry)

36:47.400 --> 36:49.436
(woman's scream from afar)

37:00.950 --> 37:05.011
- You did this.

37:05.050 --> 37:07.917
You set him free.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.425
- It was you
I wanted to set free.

37:16.560 --> 37:20.564
- You said Hannibal was
curious ifI would kill.

37:25.340 --> 37:28.309
You were curious too.

37:28.340 --> 37:31.901
- I didn't want this.
- Yes, you did.

37:31.950 --> 37:35.875
You were doing what he does.

37:35.920 --> 37:39.583
He'd be proud of you,

37:39.620 --> 37:41.884
his nakama.

37:43.560 --> 37:45.881
- Did you know?

37:48.760 --> 37:52.298
At some level...
you knew.

38:10.520 --> 38:13.887
He created a story

38:13.920 --> 38:17.856
out of events that
only he experienced.

38:21.860 --> 38:24.055
"All sorrows
can be borne

38:24.100 --> 38:26.295
if you put them
in a story."

38:35.940 --> 38:37.931
(gasp)

38:47.620 --> 38:49.451
- For Mischa.

39:07.170 --> 39:09.775
I'll help you find him.

39:09.810 --> 39:12.574
- Why would you help me?

39:12.610 --> 39:15.773
- I have no reason
to stay here.

39:15.820 --> 39:18.482
Not anymore.

39:18.520 --> 39:21.614
You saw to that.

40:56.620 --> 40:59.783
_***
- What your Sister made you feel

40:59.820 --> 41:03.153
was beyond your
conscious ability

41:03.190 --> 41:06.227
to control or predict.

41:06.260 --> 41:09.525
- Or negotiate.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.699
- I would suggest

41:11.730 --> 41:13.595
what Will Graham
makes you feel

41:13.630 --> 41:16.861
is not dissimilar.

41:16.900 --> 41:21.007
A force of mind
and Circumstance.

41:21.040 --> 41:22.871
- Love.

41:26.250 --> 41:29.515
He pays you a visit
or he doesn't.

41:29.550 --> 41:32.519
- Same with forgiveness.

41:32.550 --> 41:34.609
And I would argue,

41:34.660 --> 41:37.982
the same with betrayal.

41:38.020 --> 41:41.854
- The god Betrayal. Who
presupposes the god Forgiveness.

41:44.600 --> 41:47.489
- We can all betray.

41:49.770 --> 41:53.001
Sometimes we_have
no other ch0ice.

41:53.040 --> 41:55.770
- Mischa didn't betray me.

41:58.240 --> 42:00.208
She influenced me
to betray myself,

42:00.250 --> 42:02.013
but I forgave her
that influence.

42:07.250 --> 42:11.516
- If past behavior is an
indicator of future behavior,

42:13.730 --> 42:16.858
there is only one way
you will forgive Will Graham.

42:23.270 --> 42:25.101
- I have to eat him.

42:28.140 --> 42:30.608
(theme music)
