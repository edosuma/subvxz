00:01.878 --> 00:05.131
THE DRAGON: In the land of myth
and the time of magic,

00:05.214 --> 00:09.886
the destiny of a great kingdom rests
on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.386 --> 00:13.055
His name, Merlin.

00:34.744 --> 00:37.496
(DOGS BARKING)

00:51.928 --> 00:52.970
(GASPS)

01:05.149 --> 01:06.317
What do you want?

01:08.236 --> 01:10.196
(SCREAMS)

02:03.416 --> 02:05.042
Rise and shine!

02:05.584 --> 02:08.169
Can't you think of anything new to say?

02:09.088 --> 02:10.131
What?

02:10.214 --> 02:13.134
Every morning, it is the same thing.

02:13.301 --> 02:15.720
Oh, I'm sorry. How about...

02:16.721 --> 02:18.306
Shake a leg?

02:19.890 --> 02:21.058
Up and at 'em?

02:22.518 --> 02:24.812
Let's have you, lazy Daisy?

02:27.982 --> 02:29.108
No, you don't like any of them, do you?

02:30.776 --> 02:36.407
Okay. Uh, I'm just gonna go
before you decide to do something...

02:37.199 --> 02:38.576
(CLANKING)

02:39.243 --> 02:41.412
The building works in the lower town
have been delayed.

02:41.954 --> 02:44.040
| want you to ensure it doesn't
happen again.

02:44.123 --> 02:45.624
I'll see to it.

02:45.708 --> 02:47.418
Morning, Morgana.

02:50.212 --> 02:51.297
No. Thank you.

02:52.590 --> 02:53.591
Anything the matter?

02:55.009 --> 02:56.427
It's Gwen.

02:56.761 --> 02:58.304
She didn't turn up
for work this morning.

02:58.929 --> 02:59.930
That's not like her.

03:00.848 --> 03:01.974
| know. It's strange.

03:03.059 --> 03:04.393
| hope nothing's wrong.

03:05.436 --> 03:06.854
You needn't worry, Morgana.

03:07.355 --> 03:10.649
After all, if your maid can no longer be
relied upon, we can easily replace her.

03:14.195 --> 03:15.446
I'm sure she'll turn up soon enough.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.616
I'm sure.

03:25.247 --> 03:27.792
Go to Gwen's house.
Find out what's wrong.

03:28.292 --> 03:31.504
-And, Merlin? As quick as you can.
-Yes, sire.

03:37.301 --> 03:38.427
Gwen?

03:44.266 --> 03:45.434
Gwen?

04:17.341 --> 04:18.341
(COUGHS)

04:28.352 --> 04:29.895
You found him, then.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.068
It was easy.

04:36.694 --> 04:38.904
He was exactly where Morgana
said he'd be.

04:58.841 --> 05:00.301
Guinevere!

05:08.726 --> 05:09.768
(YELPS)

05:13.063 --> 05:14.857
| trust you had a pleasant journey?

05:16.275 --> 05:17.818
Why have you brought me to this place?

05:17.902 --> 05:20.779
| have a guest.
| thought you might like to meet him.

05:33.501 --> 05:34.835
Elyan!

05:35.377 --> 05:36.504
Gwen!

05:40.591 --> 05:43.594
Brother and sister reunited.
It warms the heart.

05:45.221 --> 05:46.597
What do you want from us?

05:49.099 --> 05:50.434
All in good time.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.824
Why are we here, Elyan?
What have you done?

06:06.116 --> 06:07.785
| didn't do anything, I promise.

06:08.661 --> 06:09.912
| swear.

06:10.496 --> 06:12.957
| was at my forge,
and they just came for me.

06:13.332 --> 06:14.917
| tried to resist, but they drugged me.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.878
There was nothing I could do.

06:23.926 --> 06:26.095
What would a man like
Cenred want with us?

06:27.304 --> 06:28.556
| wish I knew.

06:35.980 --> 06:38.190
You are a cruel man, Cenred.

06:38.274 --> 06:39.984
Is it cruel to give them a moment alone?

06:40.484 --> 06:42.236
They will have much to discuss.

06:42.319 --> 06:43.779
Indeed.

06:44.655 --> 06:48.659
Besides, the more she
feels for her brother's plight,

06:49.994 --> 06:51.662
the more she'll do for us.

06:56.292 --> 06:57.751
What's that?

06:57.835 --> 07:01.005
-I found it at Gwen's.
-It's a scrap of cloth.

07:02.006 --> 07:03.841
-I know.
-She's a seamstress.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.176
How could that possibly be important?

07:06.260 --> 07:07.636
Smell it.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.513
-No, thanks.
-Just smell it.

07:15.019 --> 07:16.145
What are...

07:27.156 --> 07:28.407
What is that?

07:28.532 --> 07:32.620
It's a compound of hogswort
and valerian.

07:32.703 --> 07:34.038
Uh, what?

07:36.373 --> 07:38.417
-I'm just guessing.
-You could knock a man out with that.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.211
Yes. Or a woman.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.478
Where have you taken Elyan?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.229
He's safe.

07:59.688 --> 08:00.731
For now.

08:01.690 --> 08:02.983
How do I know that?

08:03.067 --> 08:04.943
We can talk about your brother later.

08:06.195 --> 08:10.407
| want to talk about you
and what you can do for me.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.078
What could I possibly do for you?

08:17.081 --> 08:20.250
You can bring me Arthur Pendragon.

08:22.670 --> 08:25.673
I'm just a servant.
| have no influence with the prince.

08:25.756 --> 08:26.799
(LAUGHS)

08:26.882 --> 08:28.676
| think we both know that's not true.

08:29.635 --> 08:32.179
- I don't know what you're talking about.
-Enough!

08:34.932 --> 08:38.434
You will bring him here.
| don't care how you do it.

08:38.559 --> 08:43.273
All I care is that it is done.
You have a week.

08:45.651 --> 08:47.194
And if I do not?

08:48.278 --> 08:50.280
Then I'll let you watch

08:50.614 --> 08:52.825
when I tear your brother's heart out.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.511
The guards saw her leave
the palace at the usual time.

09:12.594 --> 09:14.388
After that, nothing.

09:14.471 --> 09:15.681
Why are you telling me this?

09:15.764 --> 09:19.393
Sire, I have reason to believe
that Guinevere has been kidnapped.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.521
-Kidnapped?
-I'd like to organize a search party.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.356
| hardly think that would
be appropriate.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.442
-Father?
-She's just a serving girl.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.153
She's the maid to the King's ward.

09:30.404 --> 09:34.658
Very well, send a squad of guards
to search the lower town.

09:35.159 --> 09:37.786
-And the countryside?
-They have until nightfall.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.163
Father, I'm not sure
what I can achieve...

09:39.246 --> 09:41.331
Arthur, I have a kingdom to protect.

09:41.957 --> 09:44.585
| cannot waste precious resources
on a servant,

09:45.502 --> 09:47.129
whatever their circumstances.

10:04.188 --> 10:07.107
Gwen? Where have you been?

10:08.358 --> 10:10.194
I'm sorry, my lady, I was unwell.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.447
Are you better now?

10:13.530 --> 10:14.823
Much better, thank you.

10:14.907 --> 10:16.575
Well, don't tire yourself out.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.827
Whatever you need to do,
I'm sure it can wait.

10:29.671 --> 10:30.839
Oh!

10:31.673 --> 10:33.175
Gwen!

10:35.135 --> 10:37.137
I've been searching
the whole town for you.

10:37.221 --> 10:40.015
-Arthur's been worried sick.
-That's very sweet of him.

10:41.183 --> 10:42.976
| just had a cold, that's all.

10:47.314 --> 10:50.192
| went to your house, Gwen.
You weren't there.

10:52.736 --> 10:56.657
Oh, no. Uh, I was just...

11:01.578 --> 11:03.330
Who did that to you?

11:03.413 --> 11:06.625
-No one. It was an accident.
-Gwen, look at me.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.962
It's fine. I'm fine.

11:20.514 --> 11:23.100
What I don't understand is
how they knew.

11:23.934 --> 11:27.271
About Arthur's feelings for you?

11:30.858 --> 11:34.778
It's common knowledge Arthur would lay
down his life for any of his subjects.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.073
Cenred could have taken anyone.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.117
Do you really believe that?

11:40.200 --> 11:44.079
All I know is you're back home safe
with your friends.

11:45.289 --> 11:46.915
You don't have to face this alone.

11:46.999 --> 11:48.959
Yes, I do, Merlin.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.712
This is my problem.
| can't involve Arthur. I won't.

11:51.795 --> 11:54.172
-Arthur's already involved.
-Not if I don't tell him about it.

11:54.256 --> 11:59.136
Gwen, if Arthur was in trouble,
wouldn't you want him to come to you?

12:01.013 --> 12:02.723
You know I would.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.561
The Castle of Fyrien, I'm sure of it.

12:07.644 --> 12:08.812
I've never even heard of it.

12:09.146 --> 12:10.439
Fyrien was a merchant.

12:10.522 --> 12:13.358
He built the castle
on the Sea of Meredor

12:13.442 --> 12:15.444
as an outpost for the trade routes
to the East.

12:15.527 --> 12:19.114
But when war broke out with Caerleon,
the trade dried up

12:19.197 --> 12:21.491
-and the castle was abandoned.
-So it's ruined now?

12:21.617 --> 12:23.410
No. It was built to withstand anything.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.787
For Cenred, it's the perfect hide-out.

12:26.038 --> 12:27.915
Doesn't sound like an easy place
to get into.

12:28.373 --> 12:31.084
It isn't. And it will be well defended.

12:31.293 --> 12:33.253
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
brought this to you.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.173
You did the right thing.

12:37.841 --> 12:40.636
Your brother will come to no harm,
| promise.

12:41.053 --> 12:42.387
How can you be so sure?

12:44.348 --> 12:45.766
Because we're going to rescue him.

12:46.475 --> 12:47.517
What do you mean "we"?

12:48.310 --> 12:49.603
The three of us.

12:50.354 --> 12:51.688
Cenred wants you dead.

12:51.772 --> 12:54.024
-That's why he's doing this.
- I know.

12:54.691 --> 12:58.612
Cenred's wanted Camelot's throne
for as long as I can remember.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.781
Then we'll be walking into a trap.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.284
Not necessarily.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.765
Sister!

13:29.309 --> 13:30.811
Is everything in place?

13:30.894 --> 13:32.229
Arthur's taken the bait.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.731
So he means to rescue her brother?

13:34.898 --> 13:37.442
Just as we thought. There is nothing
he would not do for her.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.903
Excellent. And he comes alone,
| take it?

13:40.278 --> 13:42.739
Uther would never sanction an army
for such a task.

13:42.906 --> 13:44.282
He rides with just Gwen and Merlin.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.536
Perfect. He is as good as ours.

13:47.869 --> 13:49.079
And once he is dead?

13:49.955 --> 13:54.751
Why, then you are Uther's only child,
and when the time is right

13:55.210 --> 13:57.629
you may take your place
on the throne of Camelot.

14:02.384 --> 14:03.593
Father?

14:04.011 --> 14:05.929
Hmm? What is it?

14:07.431 --> 14:09.850
It's, uh, slightly awkward.

14:10.767 --> 14:14.104
-Oh?
-I was drawn into a wager.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.189
And I lost.

14:16.273 --> 14:18.525
Arthur, you know
how I disapprove of gambling.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.235
| know. I'm sorry.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.237
How much do you owe?

14:22.821 --> 14:24.322
Two silk dresses.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.200
Excuse me?

14:27.284 --> 14:29.703
Well, at least enough silk
to have them made, anyway.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.873
What kind of wager was this, exactly?

14:33.957 --> 14:35.667
It was Morgana's idea.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.338
| should have guessed.

14:40.422 --> 14:43.967
Really, Arthur, you should know
better than to bet against Morgana.

14:44.801 --> 14:48.722
| know. The thing is, the cloth
cannot be obtained in Camelot,

14:48.805 --> 14:51.058
so I'm going to have to leave
the city for a couple of days.

14:51.141 --> 14:52.517
I'd get going if I were you.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.771
You don't want to keep her waiting.
She'll have your guts.

14:55.854 --> 14:57.022
Thank you, Father.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.487
Morgana? Are you certain?

15:03.570 --> 15:05.822
Yeah. She's been feeding
Cenred information.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.326
How else would he know about
Arthur's feelings for Gwen?

15:10.077 --> 15:11.578
Then there's no denying it.

15:11.661 --> 15:14.581
And if I could just go to Arthur
and tell him what I know...

15:14.664 --> 15:15.832
But you can't.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.460
It will be your word against Morgana's
and she's the King's daughter.

15:18.543 --> 15:19.836
| know.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.424
She's found Arthur's weak spot.

15:24.508 --> 15:27.344
Well, Arthur can't sacrifice himself
for Gwen's brother.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.182
No. Of course not.
We're going to rescue him instead.

15:33.934 --> 15:37.521
You're going to snatch this boy from
under Cenred's nose, you and Arthur?

15:38.647 --> 15:40.816
Morgana knows nothing of this?

15:40.899 --> 15:42.067
No.

15:43.819 --> 15:46.488
Merlin? Look after yourself.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.579
Aren't you forgetting something?

15:57.290 --> 15:59.042
| don't think so.

15:59.668 --> 16:00.752
But I'm coming with you.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.214
Didn't Arthur say?

16:05.507 --> 16:06.967
No, he didn't.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.558
Well, don't just stand there, Merlin.
We need another horse.

16:16.852 --> 16:18.603
Why didn't you tell me she was coming?

16:18.687 --> 16:20.730
Why should 1?
What difference does it make to you?

16:21.815 --> 16:23.483
| think it's a bad idea.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.611
Who's gonna watch my back
if we get into trouble?

16:26.695 --> 16:28.697
-I am.
-(SCOFFS)

16:28.864 --> 16:31.324
Come on. She's a darn sight better
with a sword than you'll ever be

16:31.408 --> 16:32.409
and you know it.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.870
Besides, she insisted.

16:39.374 --> 16:40.625
| bet she did.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.573
-I used to be afraid of these woods.
- I find that hard to believe.

17:12.616 --> 17:14.910
My father would bring me
here when I was a boy.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.496
It seemed every falling leaf
was a bandit,

17:18.579 --> 17:22.917
every puff of wind was a ghost.

17:23.460 --> 17:26.503
-You just get used to it in the end.
-Don't think I'd ever get used to it.

17:26.588 --> 17:29.257
You don't have to. You've got me.

17:34.638 --> 17:37.224
What I mean is
in the event of an attack,

17:37.307 --> 17:38.642
we all watch out for each other.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.936
Morgana, I think I can rely
on your protection.

17:41.937 --> 17:42.979
Of course.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.649
And, Gwen?
You'll look after Merlin, won't you?

17:45.774 --> 17:46.816
(GIGGLES)

18:05.085 --> 18:07.003
Go and get some more firewood,
would you, Merlin?

18:07.379 --> 18:08.880
| thought Morgana was doing that.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.341
Go and see if she's all right.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.218
Why wouldn't she be?

18:13.301 --> 18:15.971
| don't know.
Maybe there are wolves in these woods.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.432
No, I don't think so.

18:20.642 --> 18:21.851
Merlin?

18:30.110 --> 18:32.362
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.198
The wolves.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.373
-You need some help with that?
-Thanks.

18:57.554 --> 18:58.680
What do you want, Merlin?

18:58.763 --> 19:02.475
Arthur sent me. He wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

19:03.226 --> 19:04.561
How very thoughtful of him.

19:05.353 --> 19:08.565
Well, he cares for you, you know.
And Gwen, too.

19:08.690 --> 19:12.152
They're your friends, Morgana.
They've always been loyal to you.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.029
Why are you telling me this?

19:14.112 --> 19:18.283
Because I don't understand how
anyone would want to hurt their friends.

19:19.242 --> 19:20.702
No. You just poison them.

19:22.454 --> 19:25.081
You'd do well, Merlin, to stay out
of things that do not concern you.

19:26.291 --> 19:30.253
Oh, but they do concern me
because they're my friends, too.

19:30.879 --> 19:35.842
And I'll do whatever it takes
to protect them.

19:38.428 --> 19:39.679
| would expect nothing less.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.743
Sit for a moment.
You're wearing me out just watching you.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.329
It's good to keep busy.
Stops me thinking too much.

20:05.288 --> 20:06.664
You must be worried about Elyan.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.251
I'm always worried about Elyan.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.962
He's just one of those people.

20:13.046 --> 20:16.049
Never settled down,
never thinks about the future,

20:16.132 --> 20:17.967
just follows his heart
wherever it leads him.

20:19.594 --> 20:20.845
Doesn't sound so bad.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.557
Well, it wouldn't be, except he always
manages to be in the wrong place

20:24.641 --> 20:25.725
at the wrong time.

20:25.809 --> 20:29.104
Well, I don't think
it's his fault this time.

20:30.814 --> 20:35.276
No. But even if it was,
I'd still be there for him.

20:37.654 --> 20:40.156
It's what you do when you
love someone, isn't it?

20:48.039 --> 20:50.542
If anything happens to you,
| won't forgive myself.

20:53.503 --> 20:55.171
Don't worry.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.215
It won't.

21:03.513 --> 21:05.932
-What's wrong with these things?
-Here, let me.

21:19.154 --> 21:20.864
I'm a blacksmith's daughter, remember?

21:21.322 --> 21:22.365
Mmm.

21:49.726 --> 21:53.563
| think I may have
missed a twig back there.

21:53.897 --> 21:56.483
Uh, would you like me to go and get it?

22:02.614 --> 22:04.782
Cenred's chosen his hide-out well.

22:04.866 --> 22:07.702
Now, the Castle of Fyrien
backs onto the sea.

22:08.077 --> 22:11.873
We'll be vastly outnumbered,
and his lookouts will spot us

22:11.956 --> 22:14.417
well before we've reached the gates,
so we can't go that way.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.085
But there's no other way, surely?

22:17.420 --> 22:21.257
-Yes, there is.
-Um, more beans, anyone?

22:23.551 --> 22:25.011
-Beans?
-No, thanks.

22:25.762 --> 22:30.975
When Caerleon was defeated by my father
at the Battle of Denaria,

22:31.059 --> 22:33.394
he retreated to the Castle of Fyrien

22:33.478 --> 22:35.355
and it seemed a victory
would be denied us,

22:35.438 --> 22:39.776
but my father knew of a secret labyrinth
beneath the castle.

22:40.276 --> 22:42.737
-A labyrinth?
-Fyrien was greedy.

22:42.820 --> 22:47.450
To avoid Camelot's levies, he dug
tunnels from the castle to the sea.

22:47.534 --> 22:50.453
That way, he could smuggle goods into
the kingdom without anyone knowing.

22:50.537 --> 22:52.789
And you ambushed Caerleon
using these old tunnels.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.415
He never saw us coming.

22:55.124 --> 22:56.501
And neither will Cenred.

23:03.841 --> 23:06.052
So they are heading for the castle
as planned?

23:06.302 --> 23:07.303
Yes.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.472
But Arthur means to catch you unawares.

23:09.639 --> 23:10.807
What do you mean?

23:10.890 --> 23:12.934
He knows of some tunnels
beneath the castle.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.980
There must be a secret entrance.
Did he say where?

23:17.063 --> 23:18.314
I'm sorry, that's all I know.

23:19.482 --> 23:20.900
Then your work is not yet done, Sister.

23:22.235 --> 23:24.153
When you find the entrance,
you must lead us to it.

23:25.154 --> 23:26.322
But how?

23:30.910 --> 23:34.372

23:41.212 --> 23:44.424
When you are certain that you are

Trouble sleeping?

24:36.517 --> 24:39.270
If you have a problem, Merlin, why don't
you try talking to Arthur about it?

24:42.565 --> 24:45.568
No? Well, keep your mouth shut, then.

25:20.603 --> 25:21.646
Can you walk?

25:21.729 --> 25:23.356
No, it's your ankle.
You need to rest it.

25:23.439 --> 25:25.858
-We don't have that kind of time.
-We can't go on without her.

25:26.609 --> 25:27.902
What other choice do we have?

25:28.486 --> 25:29.529
No, no, it's all right, I can go on.

25:29.654 --> 25:33.282
No, you can't. It'll only make it worse.

25:39.539 --> 25:41.749
You were lucky.
It could have been serious.

(GROANS)

25:50.466 --> 25:52.051
-You all right?
-Yes.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.647
Morgana will lead us
to the tunnel entrance?

26:04.814 --> 26:07.150
She has not failed us so far.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.153

-Of course you do.

much from Arthur's death.

But I'm rich and powerful already.

27:01.370 --> 27:04.957
Are you sure we shouldn't try
to sneak into the castle itself?

27:05.041 --> 27:07.710
-It might be easier.
-No, the tunnels are a better bet.

27:07.835 --> 27:10.046
That way, the element of surprise
is guaranteed.

27:10.588 --> 27:14.509
-No! No, no, no.
-Are you questioning my judgment?

27:14.592 --> 27:19.639
No. No. It's just, uh, an instinct,
that's all.

27:19.722 --> 27:21.307
Oh, well, if you've got an instinct,

27:21.390 --> 27:23.935
we should ignore my lifetime
of military experience.

37:56.275 --> 37:59.570
And when he comes, we'll be waiting.

38:00.446 --> 38:05.576
And then, my lady Morgana,
you must play your part well.

38:06.410 --> 38:07.661
When have I not?

38:36.773 --> 38:38.066
Evening!

38:46.742 --> 38:48.202
That's close enough.

38:48.285 --> 38:49.620
Please don't hurt me.

38:50.913 --> 38:52.581
One more step and she dies.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.754
You're a coward, Cenred.
You always were.

38:59.922 --> 39:03.550
It's cowards that survive, Arthur.
Now, put down your sword.

39:07.262 --> 39:08.931
Do as he says.

39:13.143 --> 39:14.520
You seem surprised.

39:16.063 --> 39:17.439
Hardly.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.025
| know what you're capable of.

39:20.901 --> 39:23.070
Oh, you have no idea.

39:39.878 --> 39:42.089
(CASTING SPELL)

40:15.747 --> 40:17.666
Are you all right? Come on.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.087
Merlin, what the hell
are you doing here?

40:22.170 --> 40:25.173
- I thought you might need some help.
-Get out of here now.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.097
-I can't go on!
-What's the matter?

40:32.180 --> 40:34.808
-Worried about your friends?
-My ankle!

40:34.891 --> 40:37.019
I'm not a fool, Morgana.
| know what you're trying to do.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.729
-You know nothing!
-Come on!

40:39.646 --> 40:41.940
-What's wrong?
-My ankle.

40:45.444 --> 40:46.445
What are you doing?

40:46.528 --> 40:48.530
Trust me, I don't like it any more
than you do.

40:49.031 --> 40:50.824
Come on, Merlin!

41:00.542 --> 41:02.753
| thought I told you
to ride for Camelot.

41:03.003 --> 41:05.714
You might be a prince, but I don't
always have to do what you tell me to.

41:06.715 --> 41:07.758
(TWIGS SNAPPING)

41:24.650 --> 41:26.109
Not bad.

41:27.569 --> 41:30.489
Well, practice makes perfect.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.075
| guess.

41:43.168 --> 41:44.586
What did Cenred want with you?

41:45.754 --> 41:48.882
He was trying to extract information.
| told him nothing.

41:49.800 --> 41:52.427
You see, that's what men like Cenred
will never understand.

41:53.345 --> 41:56.390
Camelot was built on trust and loyalty.

41:57.474 --> 42:01.812
It will never be defeated as long
as we stay true to those ideals.

42:08.151 --> 42:11.113
(BELLS TOLLING)

42:11.405 --> 42:12.447
(KNOCKING)

42:12.948 --> 42:14.282
Come In.

42:20.122 --> 42:23.083
-What are they?
-Two silk dresses.

42:23.917 --> 42:25.544
In case your father asks any questions.

42:25.627 --> 42:27.003
Ah! Where did you get them from?

42:27.921 --> 42:31.508
Well, let's just say they
won't be missed for a day or two.

42:35.679 --> 42:37.139
How's Elyan settling in?

42:37.806 --> 42:38.849
Really well.

42:39.141 --> 42:42.144
He's got the forge up and running
and a place to live.

42:43.311 --> 42:45.147
He really appreciates
all the help you've given him.

42:52.446 --> 42:54.614
Was there anything else?

42:57.409 --> 42:59.077
| just wanted to say thank you

43:02.581 --> 43:04.166
for bringing my brother back.

43:05.667 --> 43:07.586
It means more to me than I can say.

43:11.673 --> 43:13.675
Well, it's like you said, Guinevere,

43:14.718 --> 43:16.386
it's what you do when you love someone.

43:41.244 --> 43:42.704
Merlin.

43:44.206 --> 43:45.665
He has to decide upon a quest.

43:45.749 --> 43:48.877
| enter into the realm of the Fisher
King and find the golden trident.

43:49.044 --> 43:51.129
Couldn't you have chosen
something a bit easier?

43:51.296 --> 43:54.966
Present this to the prince as
a token of your good wishes.

43:55.217 --> 43:56.802
It's an Eye of the Phoenix!

43:56.885 --> 43:59.554
If it's worn for too long,
Arthur will die.

43:59.930 --> 44:00.972
| have to look after him.

44:01.056 --> 44:02.265
You'll need help.

44:03.058 --> 44:05.018
So magic has arrived.

44:05.519 --> 44:06.812
When he does not return,

44:06.895 --> 44:11.900
you, Sister, will take your place
as sole heir to the throne of Camelot.
