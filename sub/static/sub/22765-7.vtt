00:08.029 --> 00:10.290
<i>Previously,</i>
<i>on Marvel's</i> Runaways...

00:10.290 --> 00:12.920
<i>As soon as I decrypt
that data, we'll have that tape,</i>

00:12.920 --> 00:15.210
undeniable proof that
our parents are killers.

00:15.210 --> 00:17.010
<i>How'd you guess
my mom's passcode?</i>

00:17.010 --> 00:18.430
I got lucky, I guess.

00:18.430 --> 00:20.060
Really lucky.

00:20.060 --> 00:22.020
What should I do about the fact

00:22.020 --> 00:25.020
that my wife is sleeping
with another man?

00:25.020 --> 00:26.360
Robert...

00:26.360 --> 00:28.280
- ‐ Oh!
- ‐

00:29.370 --> 00:31.330
‐
‐ No!

00:32.409 --> 00:33.880
Jonah can help.

00:33.880 --> 00:35.840
Oh, he's got a cure
for brain cancer?

00:35.840 --> 00:39.300
It's an experimental
immunotherapy developed from the DNA

00:39.300 --> 00:41.430
<i>of someone with an extraordinary
immune system.</i>

00:41.430 --> 00:44.060
Never felt better.
I've got a new lease on life,

00:44.060 --> 00:46.230
and a beautiful wife
who loves me.

00:46.230 --> 00:47.820
What more could a man want?

00:47.820 --> 00:49.620
I guess going Ultra wasn't for me.

00:49.620 --> 00:50.780
You went Ultra.

00:52.290 --> 00:53.830
You just didn't know it.

00:53.830 --> 00:55.750
<i>Frank should have</i>
<i>no memory of Jonah.</i>

00:55.750 --> 00:58.170
I messed up, big time.

00:58.170 --> 00:59.640
<i>Molly was in the basement.</i>

00:59.640 --> 01:01.220
I think she saw everything.

01:05.940 --> 01:08.110
That wraps it up for today.

01:08.110 --> 01:10.620
Papers due on my desk
by 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.

01:10.620 --> 01:11.990
Thank you.

01:11.990 --> 01:15.790
‐
‐

01:20.300 --> 01:22.350
Dude, have you seen
<i>Reservoir Dogs</i> yet?

01:22.350 --> 01:25.020
Oh, my God,
it was so good.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.700
You know, you're watching
the key to time travel.

01:33.620 --> 01:35.000
You're kidding, right?

01:36.080 --> 01:37.340
About time travel?

01:38.420 --> 01:40.680
No, that line. It's awful.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.890
That's not a line.
I saw your book

01:44.890 --> 01:47.860
and took you for someone
with a serious interest.

01:47.860 --> 01:49.190
My mistake.

01:51.610 --> 01:53.410
No, I'm interested...

01:54.830 --> 01:56.670
in time travel.

01:56.670 --> 01:58.670
If someone could
actually figure it out,

01:58.670 --> 02:00.130
that would change everything.

02:03.010 --> 02:05.350
Well, it's happening right now.

02:06.770 --> 02:08.940
Atmospheric refraction.

02:08.940 --> 02:11.320
Causes the light from the sun
to be distorted.

02:11.320 --> 02:15.750
The sun's already gone,
but we still see it.

02:15.750 --> 02:19.550
So it's here and not here
at the same time?

02:19.550 --> 02:22.970
Right now, we're looking
backwards in time,

02:22.970 --> 02:26.100
a moment stretched
beyond its normal limits.

02:26.100 --> 02:29.060
Imagine being given
extra time to consider,

02:29.060 --> 02:31.570
or reconsider what you're doing,

02:31.570 --> 02:33.570
the choices that you make.

02:33.570 --> 02:38.460
We could head off wars,
avoid accidents...

02:38.460 --> 02:41.130
I could not wear pink taffeta
to my senior prom.

02:41.130 --> 02:43.760
Time travel's not about
going back and forth.

02:43.760 --> 02:47.060
It's about staying
right where we are,

02:47.060 --> 02:49.730
about positioning
ourselves so that...

02:51.440 --> 02:53.530
we remain in the presence of
beauty.

02:56.740 --> 02:59.500
I'm Victor. Victor Stein.

03:00.960 --> 03:01.880
Janet.

03:06.260 --> 03:08.730
Do babies yawn?
Was he supposed to do that?

03:15.320 --> 03:16.620
Did you see?

03:19.410 --> 03:20.670
He's...

03:22.550 --> 03:24.090
He's...

03:24.090 --> 03:25.680
Everything.

03:25.680 --> 03:26.720
Yeah.

03:30.060 --> 03:31.270
I get it now.

03:32.570 --> 03:34.490
What everybody says.

03:34.490 --> 03:36.030
And what's that?

03:38.330 --> 03:40.330
This is the only thing
that matters.

03:43.710 --> 03:44.760
Just this.

How many times have I asked you
to put your crap in the trunk?

04:28.260 --> 04:29.810
Sorry.

04:31.770 --> 04:33.650
Well, looks like you won.

04:33.650 --> 04:37.150
‐ Yeah, looks like.
‐ What?

04:38.280 --> 04:40.830
That was the city championship.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.500
Do I need to drive you

04:43.500 --> 04:45.290
to a victory party or something?

04:46.380 --> 04:48.300
Where were you?

04:48.300 --> 04:49.760
Is that a yes or a no?

04:49.760 --> 04:52.100
We talked about it
this morning. You said...

04:52.100 --> 04:55.150
I said I would try.
What do you want?

04:59.740 --> 05:02.250
Congratulations.
I'm proud of you.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.040

05:07.130 --> 05:09.970
<i>Wired's</i> Visionary?

05:09.970 --> 05:11.970
‐ Give me a break.
‐ Stop.

05:11.970 --> 05:13.270
You don't know shit about shit.

05:17.110 --> 05:18.070
Say it again.

05:22.910 --> 05:24.210
You don't know shit about...!

05:25.880 --> 05:29.300
You don't know shit about...!

05:31.930 --> 05:36.400
<i>Dad? I hope you get this in time.</i>

05:36.400 --> 05:38.070
<i>I know it's a long shot,</i>

05:38.070 --> 05:42.620
<i>and I could... a lot of things up.</i>

05:42.620 --> 05:44.540
<i>I hope you get this in time.

05:44.540 --> 05:46.080
<i>I know it's a long shot,</i>

05:46.080 --> 05:49.090
<i>and I could probably screw
a lot of things up.</i>

05:49.090 --> 05:53.470
<i>Dad? I hope you

05:53.470 --> 05:54.890
<i>I know it's a...</i>

06:15.470 --> 06:17.270
<i>I just wanted
to tell you I'm sorry.</i>

06:17.270 --> 06:21.110
<i>I'm sorry for...
I'm sorry for all of it.</i>

06:21.110 --> 06:26.790
<i>Please, whatever you do, Dad,
don't pick up the Fistigons.</i>

06:26.790 --> 06:28.500
<i>...the Fistigons.</i>

06:28.500 --> 06:32.300
<i>Whatever you do, Dad,
don't pick up the Fistigons.</i>

07:50.830 --> 07:52.460
What are you
doing in here?

07:52.460 --> 07:53.840
What does it look
like I'm doing?

07:53.840 --> 07:56.180
Alex is in the shower
so I'm snooping,

07:56.180 --> 07:57.470
pretending to clean up.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.770
I'm within my constitutional
rights

08:00.770 --> 08:01.850
as a parent, anyway.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.360
You think Molly said something
to him?

08:05.360 --> 08:07.280
That's what I'm trying to find out.

08:10.410 --> 08:12.710
Alex hasn't been right since
that night.

08:12.710 --> 08:14.460
It could be a million things.

08:14.460 --> 08:17.760
Yeah. Darius, Nico...

08:17.760 --> 08:18.850
Nico?

08:20.560 --> 08:22.100
He's got a thing for her.

08:23.310 --> 08:25.480
Please. What do you know?

08:25.480 --> 08:27.820
A father knows.

08:27.820 --> 08:29.450
Also, he told me.

08:29.450 --> 08:31.330
And you didn't tell me?

08:31.330 --> 08:32.710
Tell you what?

08:33.880 --> 08:35.549
That you and Nico are a thing.

08:36.970 --> 08:38.390
Yeah, we're not a thing.

08:38.390 --> 08:40.100
So sad about her mom and dad.

08:40.100 --> 08:41.390
How's she holding up?

08:41.390 --> 08:43.600
Yeah, it was a shock to us.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.860
I can only imagine
what it was like for her.

08:45.860 --> 08:48.280
Yeah, you think
you know your parents.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.700
What are you guys doing in here?

08:51.240 --> 08:53.330
These clothes don't clean
themselves.

08:53.330 --> 08:56.880
We wanted you to have something nice
to wear for the open house tonight.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.300
Open house?

08:58.300 --> 09:00.890
You know, when we get
to visit your classrooms,

09:00.890 --> 09:02.310
and see your teachers,

09:02.310 --> 09:04.440
and hear what's really
going on with you.

09:04.440 --> 09:06.570
I'm familiar with the
open house concept,

09:06.570 --> 09:08.820
I just... I forgot
about it, I guess.

09:08.820 --> 09:11.280
Well, if you have anything

09:11.280 --> 09:14.880
you want to fill us in on
before this evening, feel free.

09:14.880 --> 09:18.760
Not... unless there's something
you guys want to tell me.

09:21.140 --> 09:22.560
‐ We're good.
‐ Definitely.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.350
- ‐ Oh, great.
- ‐

09:24.350 --> 09:27.190
Then it should be
a pretty boring evening.

09:30.490 --> 09:31.780
I got that.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.580
I gotta go.

09:36.540 --> 09:38.800
Love you too, son.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.550
Okay, we are not paranoid.

09:40.550 --> 09:43.260
We need to be all up in his
business until we know for sure.

09:43.260 --> 09:45.560
And then there's Molly.

09:45.560 --> 09:46.770
I've been thinking about it,

09:46.770 --> 09:49.780
but it will require Dale
and Stacey

09:49.780 --> 09:51.360
keeping a secret.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.160
Yeah, that's no sure thing.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.260
Yo, Dad...

10:03.510 --> 10:04.730
Hey, Dad.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.070
Yo, Dad!

10:09.070 --> 10:10.490
Son.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.830
I didn't hear you come in.

10:13.830 --> 10:16.370
Hey, you're
a little preoccupied.

10:16.370 --> 10:19.710
We have been trying to increase
the Nemo battery range

10:19.710 --> 10:21.930
without decreasing
the drag coefficients,

10:21.930 --> 10:24.350
which has vexed
our best engineers for years.

10:24.350 --> 10:26.770
I'm not sure if I'm following
all or any of this,

10:26.770 --> 10:29.520
but based on how many times
you circled the last number...

10:29.520 --> 10:31.990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I cracked it.

10:31.990 --> 10:34.120
It wasn't hard, either.

10:34.120 --> 10:35.870
Leads me to believe I should fire

10:35.870 --> 10:37.540
every one of my engineers.

10:37.540 --> 10:41.420
‐ Maybe I should hire Mr. Siebey.
‐ My physics teacher?

10:41.420 --> 10:43.550
Clearly, he's done
a great job teaching you...

10:44.640 --> 10:45.930
better than I've done.

10:45.930 --> 10:47.430
I'm pretty sure the guy

10:47.430 --> 10:49.730
wore the same pair of pants
for an entire semester.

10:49.730 --> 10:51.150
Sign of an uncluttered mind.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.110
I look forward to speaking
with him this evening

10:53.110 --> 10:55.030
and thanking him
for his inspiration.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.490
Wait, you're going
to the open house?

10:56.490 --> 10:58.160
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

10:58.160 --> 11:00.290
Other than literally every other
time it's happened.

11:00.290 --> 11:02.340
Yes. Yes. Yes.

11:02.340 --> 11:04.180
You're right, I've...

11:04.180 --> 11:07.140
but everything is going
to be different now.

11:07.140 --> 11:09.020
‐ Okay?
‐ Yeah.

11:09.020 --> 11:10.310
Yeah.

11:10.310 --> 11:11.820
Oh!

11:13.110 --> 11:15.120
Pops, when was
the last time you showered?

11:15.120 --> 11:16.740
You are ripe!

11:16.740 --> 11:18.910
Um, ahem, I don't mean
to interrupt

11:18.910 --> 11:20.590
this lovely father‐son moment,

11:20.590 --> 11:22.170
but Chase has to head to school.

11:22.170 --> 11:24.340
And, apparently,
I need to freshen up

11:24.340 --> 11:27.770
before I blow everyone's mind
at the office.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.480
Looking forward
to this evening, Chase!

11:30.480 --> 11:31.860
Oh, love you.

11:34.070 --> 11:36.700
‐ What's this evening?
‐ Open house.

11:36.700 --> 11:38.240
He's going to that?

11:38.240 --> 11:39.830
I thought the side effects
of new meds

11:39.830 --> 11:42.340
involved mild nausea
and swollen ankles,

11:42.340 --> 11:45.090
not a complete
personality change.

11:45.090 --> 11:47.470
What the hell kind of medicine
did that guy give him?

11:47.470 --> 11:52.060
I have no idea.
I'm just glad it's working.

11:52.060 --> 11:54.150
I keep waiting
for the old Victor to return.

11:54.150 --> 11:57.200
Well, maybe we'll get lucky
and he won't.

11:57.200 --> 12:00.620
Though that would make it
harder for you to leave.

12:00.620 --> 12:03.040
If I wanted to walk out,

12:03.040 --> 12:05.760
your father has given me
more than enough excuses.

12:06.930 --> 12:08.140
So, you're no longer

12:08.140 --> 12:10.020
into married software engineers

12:10.020 --> 12:13.400
with a fondness for... mandals?

12:13.400 --> 12:18.370
Robert was kind when my life
was short on kindness.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.540
It was an escape, nothing more.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.630
Meanwhile, Dad was dying
of a brain tumor,

12:22.630 --> 12:24.170
and you didn't notice.

12:25.970 --> 12:28.180
I feel terrible that I missed
the signs,

12:28.180 --> 12:31.430
but I've suffered a long time
trying to hold us all together.

12:31.430 --> 12:34.690
So, if there's a chance
we can be a happy family again,

12:34.690 --> 12:37.070
I'm not gonna let anything
stand in our way.

13:00.790 --> 13:02.830
Just wanted to say hi.

13:02.830 --> 13:04.540
Or bye.

13:06.380 --> 13:09.510
I won't be here when you
get home from school.

13:10.760 --> 13:14.440
But I'll be there this evening.

13:14.440 --> 13:18.440
Your mother and I
are a unified front

13:18.440 --> 13:20.830
when it comes to your education,

13:20.830 --> 13:23.540
even though I don't live here
anymore.

13:30.850 --> 13:33.810
I love you so much, Nico.

13:33.810 --> 13:35.810
I hope you know that.

13:35.810 --> 13:37.230
I do.

13:38.530 --> 13:40.820
And I know you love Mom, too.

13:41.910 --> 13:43.450
Just talk to her.

13:43.450 --> 13:45.330
You know, apologize.

13:45.330 --> 13:47.040
I bet she'd forgive you.

13:47.040 --> 13:50.050
She knows how difficult
she's been, so...

13:50.050 --> 13:52.680
I wish it was that easy.

13:52.680 --> 13:55.060
People forgive things
that are much worse.

13:55.060 --> 13:56.940
You could work it out.

13:56.940 --> 14:00.780
We... we...
we could, but it's...

14:03.200 --> 14:05.500
It's not what I want, Nico.

14:05.500 --> 14:06.790
Not anymore.

14:11.130 --> 14:12.930
What, I mean...

14:12.930 --> 14:15.560
you're, like,
in love with Janet Stein?

14:15.560 --> 14:17.060
I mean, come on.

14:24.490 --> 14:28.880
Oh, my God, you're in love with
Janet Stein.

14:28.880 --> 14:31.220
It's not like I plannedon it,
believe me.

14:31.220 --> 14:33.510
Yeah, well, good luck.

14:33.510 --> 14:35.720
Enjoy it while you still can.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.950
You were here on the first day...

14:43.950 --> 14:45.870
and you will be here on the last.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.500
You were always ready...

14:49.670 --> 14:51.920
without beginning or end,

14:51.920 --> 14:53.590
one with the universe,

14:53.590 --> 14:55.390
endless and eternal,

14:55.390 --> 14:57.310
ever with us,

14:57.310 --> 14:59.440
and we, ever with you.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.980
This is true.

15:00.980 --> 15:02.320
This is true.

15:04.660 --> 15:07.080
He's ready to see the Spectrum.

15:13.050 --> 15:14.970
When we turn the ventilator off,
he may...

15:14.970 --> 15:16.560
Don't touch anything.

15:17.810 --> 15:20.310
Frank, we weren't expecting you.

15:22.230 --> 15:24.030
Would you like to join our circle?

15:24.030 --> 15:27.330
Actually, Leslie,
I need you to step aside.

15:30.170 --> 15:31.420
Trust me.

15:43.650 --> 15:44.570
You, too.

15:46.700 --> 15:49.290
Just give us a moment alone,
please, thank you.

15:55.300 --> 15:56.970
What are you doing?

15:56.970 --> 15:58.430
This.

16:00.020 --> 16:01.230
Don't.

16:01.230 --> 16:03.070
Stop it!

16:03.070 --> 16:04.030
Stop!

16:13.040 --> 16:15.090
What's happening?

16:17.430 --> 16:19.890
You've been given something
we all want.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.560
More time.

16:25.570 --> 16:27.240
Dad?

16:30.580 --> 16:31.790
What did you do?

16:31.790 --> 16:33.210
My new job.

16:38.260 --> 16:39.760
What the hell was that?

16:39.760 --> 16:41.810
I'm sorry to step
on your moment back there,

16:41.810 --> 16:43.150
but Calvin's a friend.

16:43.150 --> 16:44.310
We're in the same men's group.

16:44.310 --> 16:45.400
He brings the best snacks.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.740
Why did Jonah give you those?

16:46.740 --> 16:48.240
He and I had a lovely chat

16:48.240 --> 16:50.370
about the church and my future
there.

16:50.370 --> 16:53.830
I hope you don't have
a problem with that.

16:53.830 --> 16:57.590
The problem is you have
no idea what you're doing.

16:57.590 --> 17:00.850
That was a parlor trick,

17:00.850 --> 17:03.020
but it has real consequences.

17:03.020 --> 17:05.109
What if that family tells everybody

17:05.109 --> 17:06.690
that you're some kind of healer?

17:06.690 --> 17:08.150
Oh, I'm counting on it.

17:23.560 --> 17:26.400
Stuck with our families
for an entire evening,

17:26.400 --> 17:28.530
acting as if everything's fine.

17:28.530 --> 17:30.320
Not my parents.

17:33.250 --> 17:35.580
My dad moves out today.

17:35.580 --> 17:37.590
Damn. Nico, I'm sorry.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.890
Doesn't make any difference if
they all end up in jail anyway.

17:40.890 --> 17:43.060
Well, if there's anything
that I can do...

17:44.810 --> 17:45.730
One thing.

17:47.940 --> 17:51.110
How did you know how to get
into my mom's office at Wizard?

17:51.110 --> 17:53.870
And, please, just don't
tell me some bullshit

17:53.870 --> 17:55.870
that her password was "password."

17:59.170 --> 18:01.090
Any chance
our parents can get arrested

18:01.090 --> 18:02.850
before they talk to our teachers?

18:02.850 --> 18:04.730
Yeah, I can't say that I've been

18:04.730 --> 18:06.230
a banner student lately.

18:06.230 --> 18:08.020
Who can even think about homework?

18:08.020 --> 18:10.030
Guess we'll have a hell of a
personal essay

18:10.030 --> 18:11.490
for our college applications.

18:11.490 --> 18:12.990
Isn't this adorbs!

18:12.990 --> 18:15.000
You kids planning a big
double date?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.080
What do the kids do
for fun these days?

18:17.080 --> 18:21.550
Is it a... escape room?
Karaoke? A knitting circle?

18:21.550 --> 18:23.390
No one is planning a date.

18:23.390 --> 18:25.180
Escape room does sound sick,
though.

18:25.180 --> 18:27.690
‐ If it means escaping from here.
‐ Whoa, zinger!

18:27.690 --> 18:30.940
Karolina, you should sign up
for the school improv troupe.

18:30.940 --> 18:34.410
Guys, we're supposed to be taking
on our parents, not each other.

18:34.410 --> 18:37.080
Well, what's happening
with the video data?

18:37.080 --> 18:39.090
I'm still working on it.

18:39.090 --> 18:40.800
It's harder to unlock
than I thought,

18:40.800 --> 18:42.340
and now my parents are on my ass.

18:42.340 --> 18:43.640
Yeah, mine too.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.060
Do you think they know?

18:45.060 --> 18:46.600
I'm not sure how.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.400
Oh!

18:49.400 --> 18:51.780
It's okay. We can put it
back together.

18:51.780 --> 18:54.200
Who cares? Who cares about a
double helix!

18:54.200 --> 18:57.410
Molly, is everything okay?

18:59.710 --> 19:01.590
I screwed up, you guys.

19:01.590 --> 19:03.640
I got something to tell you.

19:14.490 --> 19:15.950
Are you kidding?

19:15.950 --> 19:18.620
I know, I panicked.
Your mom is very intimidating.

19:18.620 --> 19:20.750
Well, she has the conviction
rate to prove it.

19:20.750 --> 19:23.090
Now you're telling me she's been
suspicious of you from the beginning.

19:23.090 --> 19:24.680
Not to mention you're responsible

19:24.680 --> 19:26.720
for only one working bathroom
at Timely Coffee.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.310
If they know
you saw the robes,

19:28.310 --> 19:30.020
they know you got down
the staircase.

19:30.020 --> 19:32.230
Unless they wear
their robes to other places,

19:32.230 --> 19:35.450
like the gym, or Whole Foods.

19:35.450 --> 19:37.740
Then again, nothing
in my house has changed.

19:37.740 --> 19:39.460
In fact, it's gotten better.

19:39.460 --> 19:42.210
Except for the fact that our
parents are having an affair.

19:42.210 --> 19:44.630
No, that's all over.
My mom told me this morning.

19:44.630 --> 19:47.140
Well, at least I know why my
parents are living in my room.

19:47.140 --> 19:48.310
Dude, I said I'm sorry.

19:48.310 --> 19:49.940
Why didn't you tell us, Molly?

19:49.940 --> 19:51.190
Why didn't you tell me?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.610
Every time I try
to tell you guys stuff,

19:52.610 --> 19:53.690
you act like I'm some kid

19:53.690 --> 19:54.700
who can't be believed.

19:54.700 --> 19:55.990
It's not your fault.

19:55.990 --> 19:57.580
This is too much
for us to handle,

19:57.580 --> 19:58.750
let alone someone your age.

19:58.750 --> 19:59.790
You're, like, three years older!

19:59.790 --> 20:00.870
This is why I literally tried

20:00.870 --> 20:02.590
to protect you from seeing this.

20:02.590 --> 20:04.460
We can't do this thing
if we can't trust each other.

20:04.460 --> 20:06.010
I'm super honest.

20:06.010 --> 20:08.430
Yeah, Molly, maybe a little too
honest sometimes.

20:08.430 --> 20:10.270
You know what?
Forget it.

20:10.270 --> 20:12.360
If after all we've been through
this is how it's gonna be,

20:12.360 --> 20:14.820
then I don't want anything
to do with you guys!

20:14.820 --> 20:16.570
Molly, hold on!

20:29.060 --> 20:30.730
‐ Wow!
‐ Right?

20:30.730 --> 20:33.610
‐ I have never seen anything like this.
‐ It's amazing.

20:33.610 --> 20:35.190
I mean, he is amazing!

20:35.190 --> 20:37.660
He's also scary,
and if Jonah ever finds out...

20:37.660 --> 20:39.700
‐that you pinched his serum...
‐Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.330
The guy practically
handed it to me.

20:41.330 --> 20:43.460
It's like he wanted us
to examine it, okay?

20:43.460 --> 20:47.840
But, yes, I agree, I would very
much prefer he didn't find out.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.260
‐ Yeah.
‐

20:50.430 --> 20:52.020
It's truly incredible!

20:52.020 --> 20:53.480
When we synthesize DNA,

20:53.480 --> 20:56.070
we take every precaution
to not stretch genetic code

20:56.070 --> 20:59.660
in such a way that it creates
a toxin or a disease, but...

20:59.660 --> 21:03.920
Jonah's DNA in this serum when
stretched does the opposite!

21:03.920 --> 21:05.670
It creates healing!

21:05.670 --> 21:09.340
I know, it's like a crazy malware
in a computer virus.

21:09.340 --> 21:14.520
It spreads like a Belle Creme
from the south of France.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.780
Aw, even after 14 straight hours,

21:16.780 --> 21:19.320
your cheese references
never fail to impress.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.080
Aw! It's all for you, my love.

21:22.370 --> 21:23.290
Whoa.

21:25.460 --> 21:27.670
Oh...

21:27.670 --> 21:29.220
‐ You all right?
‐ I think so.

21:29.220 --> 21:30.470
Didn't feel a thing.

21:35.060 --> 21:37.270
Sure you're okay?

21:37.270 --> 21:40.360
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I'm just a little lightheaded.

21:40.360 --> 21:41.740
Must be hungry.

21:41.740 --> 21:43.750
Well, we have leftover
Thai food in the fridge.

21:43.750 --> 21:45.080
‐ Okay.
‐ Pad see ew?

21:45.080 --> 21:46.590
Pad see ew, too, babe!

21:46.590 --> 21:47.880
‐ Love you.
‐ All right.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.120
I didn't realize we had plans.

22:07.250 --> 22:08.420
Where have you been?

22:09.720 --> 22:12.010
I was at the construction site.

22:12.010 --> 22:14.100
They delivered the drill today.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.810
So, this is what you want?

22:15.810 --> 22:17.810
To undermine my authority?

22:17.810 --> 22:20.150
You have authority
because I gave it to you.

22:20.150 --> 22:22.990
This is
my father's church!

22:22.990 --> 22:24.580
And it's my religion.

22:27.630 --> 22:31.300
Where were you when I gathered
all these believers together?

22:31.300 --> 22:34.560
Where were you when I pulled
those kids off the streets?

22:36.390 --> 22:40.230
If you think my power
comes only from your teachings

22:40.230 --> 22:41.700
or your healing gloves...

22:41.700 --> 22:43.530
Ah, so that's
what this is about.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.330
‐What?
‐You're upset

22:45.330 --> 22:47.830
because I gave your husband
something I've never given you.

22:47.830 --> 22:49.670
This has nothing to do with Frank.

22:49.670 --> 22:51.920
It's about my father's legacy

22:51.920 --> 22:53.800
that I have devoted my life to.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.770
The church is in the past, Leslie.

22:57.730 --> 23:00.070
You don't want to be around
when it goes down.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.450
What?

23:06.620 --> 23:09.670
Your father would be so proud

23:09.670 --> 23:11.420
of everything that you've done...

23:14.090 --> 23:15.510
but you and I...

23:17.220 --> 23:22.110
have become a part of something
much, much larger now.

23:23.490 --> 23:25.030
PRIDE.

23:25.030 --> 23:29.170
PRIDE is the only thing
that matters.

23:36.010 --> 23:37.850
You have such a big heart.

23:39.270 --> 23:41.310
Your compassion's healed so many.

23:42.820 --> 23:45.620
Now I need you to turn it
towards your friends,

23:45.620 --> 23:47.660
because they're falling apart,

23:47.660 --> 23:51.210
and you are the only one with the
power to bring them back together.

23:53.090 --> 23:55.050
I need you to do that,

23:55.050 --> 23:56.890
and I need you to do it quickly.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.100
Why, is something wrong?

24:01.100 --> 24:04.030
No. Nothing's wrong.

24:08.450 --> 24:09.910
Not yet, anyway.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.390
Five, six, seven, eight.

24:17.390 --> 24:19.430
One, two, three, four.

24:19.430 --> 24:21.390
Five, six, seven, eight.

24:21.390 --> 24:23.150
One, two, three, four.

24:23.150 --> 24:25.610
Smile, ladies,
show me those teeth!

24:25.610 --> 24:27.160
Carol, not you.

24:28.530 --> 24:31.250
Okay, guys, I need to see
some attitude.

24:31.250 --> 24:33.840
<i>♪ ...show her
a little swing ♪</i>

24:33.840 --> 24:35.550
Okay, that was terrible.

24:38.430 --> 24:40.140
Five, six, seven, eight.

24:40.140 --> 24:42.270
‐ Snap.
‐<i> ♪ ...the bling‐bling, girl ♪</i>

24:42.270 --> 24:43.900
<i>♪ There ain't nothing to do ♪</i>

24:43.900 --> 24:48.030
Okay, guys, point
your toes, ready, go.

24:50.200 --> 24:52.210
Those are not splits.
What is that?

24:52.210 --> 24:53.580
<i>♪ Ain't no big thing ♪</i>

24:53.580 --> 24:55.420
<i>♪ Just show her
a little swing ♪</i>

24:59.050 --> 25:00.640
All right, cut it!

25:00.640 --> 25:04.310
Someone teach Brittany how to do
an eight‐count, please!

25:04.310 --> 25:05.940
Hi, Eiffel. What's up?

25:07.240 --> 25:08.450
Do I know you?

25:08.450 --> 25:09.620
Molly.

25:10.700 --> 25:11.870
Molly Hernandez.

25:11.870 --> 25:13.960
I tried out
for the team, but um...

25:13.960 --> 25:15.960
I kind of didn't finish
my audition.

25:15.960 --> 25:18.930
Right, you were the one
menstruating during her routine.

25:18.930 --> 25:22.180
What can I say,
I'm all about
that blood life.

25:22.180 --> 25:24.060
I was wondering
if there was a spot open.

25:24.060 --> 25:26.070
I'm really good,
practicing a lot,

25:26.070 --> 25:29.030
and I just want to be
a part of something, you know?

25:29.030 --> 25:32.370
Yeah. You know,
we have a spot for you.

25:32.370 --> 25:34.960
‐ Really?
‐ Team manager.

25:34.960 --> 25:37.590
Oh, my God, thank you so much.

25:37.590 --> 25:40.180
Like, I'm gonna be working
on routines, designing uniforms?

25:40.180 --> 25:41.850
I have a lot of thoughts
on athleisure trends.

25:41.850 --> 25:43.730
Yeah, it's actually
more like washing towels

25:43.730 --> 25:45.100
and filling up water bottles,

25:45.100 --> 25:47.150
but, um, you're cool with that,
right?

25:47.150 --> 25:48.820
I guess.

25:48.820 --> 25:50.410
Awesome.

25:50.410 --> 25:51.620
Thanks, Mia.

25:51.620 --> 25:53.490
‐ Molly.
‐ Whatever.

25:53.490 --> 25:54.580
Thanks.

25:54.580 --> 25:56.790
‐ Yeah, thank you.
‐ Okay.

25:56.790 --> 25:57.800
‐ Thanks, hon.
‐ It's not a good job,

25:57.800 --> 25:58.960
but someone's gotta do it.

26:02.850 --> 26:06.480
Hey, you all right?

26:06.480 --> 26:09.650
I guess I deserve it, right,
since I ruin everything?

26:09.650 --> 26:11.660
You don't ruin everything.

26:11.660 --> 26:14.950
We were all friends.
Everything was going great.

26:14.950 --> 26:16.670
That's what I love
about you, Molly.

26:16.670 --> 26:19.130
Our parents are killers,
the cops are crooked,

26:19.130 --> 26:21.590
and we almost got killed
by some gang members.

26:21.590 --> 26:24.720
But you see it as "everything
is going great."

26:24.720 --> 26:28.190
Maybe my true super power
is my positive attitude.

26:28.190 --> 26:31.240
Now you sound like a poster
in my dentist's office.

26:32.910 --> 26:34.990
So does this mean
you and I are still friends?

26:34.990 --> 26:37.630
Of course.
We share the kind of secret

26:37.630 --> 26:40.340
that nobody else understands.

26:40.340 --> 26:43.090
Yeah. What's the fun of flying
if you can't tell anyone?

26:43.090 --> 26:45.270
Or lifting a truck
with your bare hands?

26:47.690 --> 26:49.690
You know, I just wish
everyone else felt the same.

26:52.490 --> 26:54.530
Well, it's... I gotta go.

26:56.120 --> 26:58.040
All right. Come on.

27:00.250 --> 27:02.630
Hey, hon. I have lunch.

27:02.630 --> 27:04.430
No, no, can't eat, not now,
not when there's...

27:04.430 --> 27:06.020
so much science to be achieved.

27:08.140 --> 27:10.690
You do realize that Jonah's serum,
if harnessed properly,

27:10.690 --> 27:12.610
could reverse the aging process.

27:12.610 --> 27:16.580
The chance to cheat death is
right at our fingertips! Hah!

27:16.580 --> 27:19.250
Jesus, Dale, this is why
you need to stick to decaf.

27:19.250 --> 27:22.090
Imagine the ability to live
together forever, Mama Bear!

27:22.090 --> 27:24.300
Eternity with the one
that I love.

27:24.300 --> 27:25.930
What could be better?

27:27.770 --> 27:31.440
Oh! That was the greatest kiss
I've ever experienced.

27:31.440 --> 27:34.240
It was like this... this...
this explosion of color,

27:34.240 --> 27:35.740
but in my mouth!

27:35.740 --> 27:37.750
Oh, shit.

27:37.750 --> 27:39.410
I love you, Stacey Yorkes.

27:39.410 --> 27:42.380
Your auburn curls,
your scratchy, adorable voice,

27:42.380 --> 27:45.130
your shoes... I mean, Crocs!
What are Crocs!

27:45.130 --> 27:47.600
Crocs are a gift from God,
don't you think?

27:47.600 --> 27:49.770
That drop...
you've been infected!

27:49.770 --> 27:51.400
Infected with love!

27:51.400 --> 27:54.190
‐ Oh, you're tripping... on Jonah.
‐ Whoo!

27:54.190 --> 27:56.320
What?

27:58.620 --> 28:01.000
Who is at our front door right now?

28:03.500 --> 28:05.720
Oh, crap. It's the Wilders.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.100
The G‐man? Invite him in!

28:07.100 --> 28:08.890
I love that big, bald teddy bear!

28:10.100 --> 28:12.730
Okay. Hello?

28:12.730 --> 28:14.780
<i>Stacey, we need to talk to you.</i>

28:14.780 --> 28:15.860
<i>It's about Molly.</i>

28:15.860 --> 28:18.410
Molly! I love Molly so much,

28:18.410 --> 28:20.620
with the little kitty cats.
Hey, we should get a cat!

28:21.830 --> 28:23.420
Um, we would love to,

28:23.420 --> 28:26.130
but we're, um, deep
into something over here,

28:26.130 --> 28:28.510
I mean, harmful things
that you could be exposed to.

28:28.510 --> 28:30.600
Is there any way we could talk
tonight at the open house?

28:30.600 --> 28:31.770
Oh, it's so hot.
It's so, so hot!

28:31.770 --> 28:33.020
I've never been...

28:33.020 --> 28:36.200
Oh, yeah... if we make it.

28:37.360 --> 28:40.160
Isn't this kind of depressing?

28:40.160 --> 28:42.170
Why not just order some
new stuff from Crate & Barrel?

28:42.170 --> 28:43.750
Vaughn, if you're gonna be
my new assistant,

28:43.750 --> 28:45.340
there's something you
need to know about me.

28:45.340 --> 28:46.800
I don't believe
I agreed to that.

28:46.800 --> 28:50.220
I have a deep reverence
for the church,

28:50.220 --> 28:53.770
and this area is where the history
of our movement has been stored.

28:53.770 --> 28:55.190
Like... like this.

28:55.190 --> 28:57.780
This is the first podium

28:57.780 --> 29:00.120
from the original building
over on 4th Street.

29:02.710 --> 29:05.380
And those... those...
those chairs.

29:05.380 --> 29:08.590
They lined the hallway
of the intake area for 12 years.

29:08.590 --> 29:11.100
Think about all the lives
that were changed

29:11.100 --> 29:13.560
while people sat
in these chairs.

29:15.440 --> 29:18.780
‐ Whoa.
‐ What?

29:18.780 --> 29:22.120
Shut the front door!

29:25.250 --> 29:27.090
That's a nice desk.

29:27.090 --> 29:28.760
This desk belonged
to David Ellerh.

29:28.760 --> 29:32.310
This is the desk where he wrote
<i>The Book of Gibborim.</i>

29:32.310 --> 29:34.520
‐ Wow.
‐ I have to have this desk.

29:34.520 --> 29:35.860
Mark it down.

29:35.860 --> 29:37.990
Are you sure Leslie
will be okay with that?

29:37.990 --> 29:40.160
Yes. Yes. Yes.

29:41.990 --> 29:44.670
I bet all of this stuff
belonged to him.

29:53.600 --> 29:56.060
Mr. Dean? Are you...

29:58.860 --> 30:01.490
Mr. Dean?

30:07.630 --> 30:08.760
‐ Get out!
‐<i> Mr. Dean?</i>

30:10.420 --> 30:11.470
Mr. Dean?

30:12.760 --> 30:14.140
Is something wrong?

30:21.570 --> 30:23.740
Welcome to Atlas Academy's
Annual Open House.

30:23.740 --> 30:26.460
Our students and faculty have
been preparing

30:26.460 --> 30:27.920
for this night for months...

30:27.920 --> 30:29.630
‐
‐ ...and we're all thrilled

30:29.630 --> 30:31.930
to share what we've been up to.

30:31.930 --> 30:35.140
We have student club booths
for you to visit,

30:35.140 --> 30:38.150
as well as special displays
throughout the campus.

30:38.150 --> 30:39.860
What's wrong with him?

30:39.860 --> 30:41.400
Allergy medicine.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.700
He's very sensitive
to the antihistamines.

30:43.700 --> 30:45.830
‐ Honey?
‐ The dog...

30:45.830 --> 30:48.630
Honey, please.

30:48.630 --> 30:53.180
Oh, so bright.
It's all so bright.

30:53.180 --> 30:55.180
He's okay. He's fine.

30:56.770 --> 30:59.230
I am certain there is
something surprising

30:59.230 --> 31:01.820
waiting for you
at this year's open house.

31:01.820 --> 31:05.370
Now, for the past decade,
we have been recognizing

31:05.370 --> 31:08.500
our outstanding students
and their dedicated mentors...

31:08.500 --> 31:11.800
Do not even think
of going to stand by him.

31:11.800 --> 31:15.300
I won't. Just please
don't make this awkward.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.390
He's the one making it awkward.

31:17.390 --> 31:21.900
...tradition, and one I look
forward to greatly each year.

31:21.900 --> 31:25.660
One of my favorite aspects
of this open house is the chance

31:25.660 --> 31:27.620
to experience some of the fruits

31:27.620 --> 31:30.500
of our students' scholarly
and creative activity.

31:30.500 --> 31:34.050
We learn more from our students
themselves...

31:34.050 --> 31:36.890
It's not like your father
to miss something like this.

31:38.060 --> 31:39.980
I'm sure he'll show up.

31:39.980 --> 31:43.950
...you will see many
impressive examples of that.

31:43.950 --> 31:46.990
No, Dad, this is
a straight‐up assembly.

31:46.990 --> 31:48.290
You're supposed to just listen.

31:48.290 --> 31:49.960
Mr. Stein,
you had a question?

31:49.960 --> 31:51.420
Will there be an opportunity

31:51.420 --> 31:53.760
to interface with the
faculty this evening?

31:53.760 --> 31:55.380
I wanted to personally thank

31:55.380 --> 31:57.220
each and every one
of my son's instructors.

31:57.220 --> 32:00.350
They've helped mold him
into a fine young man.

32:00.350 --> 32:02.980
We welcome input
from all our parents.

32:02.980 --> 32:06.410
Now, if you'll proceed
to your first classrooms.

32:20.060 --> 32:21.650
Upend the patriarchy!

32:21.650 --> 32:25.190
I built it myself,
using recycled oceanic waste.

32:25.190 --> 32:27.490
We're taking it
to Sacramento next week.

32:27.490 --> 32:29.830
<i>♪ Just show her
a little swing ♪</i>

32:34.500 --> 32:38.640
So, these are your people now?

32:38.640 --> 32:40.730
Eiffel appreciates me.

32:40.730 --> 32:42.230
Maria, fill that up.

32:44.940 --> 32:47.570
What? She's a dancer.
Hydration's important.

32:47.570 --> 32:49.830
Not as important as self‐respect.

32:49.830 --> 32:51.200
Everyone has to start somewhere.

32:51.200 --> 32:54.040
I'm fine.
I got grit and friends,

32:54.040 --> 32:55.670
which is more than you can say.

32:55.670 --> 32:57.590
We can't let this country
be run by a dictator!

32:57.590 --> 32:59.760
Don't you know
your rights are being violated?

32:59.760 --> 33:02.310
What happened?
You guys staged a coup?

33:02.310 --> 33:04.520
More like you abdicated.

33:04.520 --> 33:06.650
Sorry, Gert, the revolution
stops for no one.

33:06.650 --> 33:08.740
Also, we thought
that undermining the patriarchy

33:08.740 --> 33:10.620
was too mild a response
to recent events.

33:10.620 --> 33:12.290
We're going straight at it.

33:16.050 --> 33:18.510
Yes, yes, you are.

33:22.480 --> 33:24.190
Not at the Gib booth this year?

33:24.190 --> 33:26.230
I basically was the Gib booth.

33:26.230 --> 33:28.070
Me, standing alone with my dad,

33:28.070 --> 33:30.370
while Atlas moms
ask for his autograph.

33:30.370 --> 33:32.660
So, no. No Gib booth this year.

33:32.660 --> 33:34.880
Kind of looks like
he's got his own booth.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.880
Oh, I knew he'd come.
Hey, Dad!

33:36.880 --> 33:38.420
Hey, kiddo.

33:38.420 --> 33:40.140
‐ You're late!
‐ I know, I'm sorry about that.

33:40.140 --> 33:41.470
Have you seen your mom?

33:41.470 --> 33:43.690
Okay.

33:43.690 --> 33:47.650
Look, I know things are weird,
but it'll feel more normal soon.

33:47.650 --> 33:50.820
You'll stay over
at our new place,

33:50.820 --> 33:53.290
and then we can have dinner,
Janet, me, and you,

33:53.290 --> 33:55.460
and she is an amazing cook.

33:55.460 --> 33:56.920
You won't believe...

33:56.920 --> 34:00.800
Dad, have you tried talking
to her about all this?

34:08.190 --> 34:10.239
‐ Doing okay?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

34:12.739 --> 34:14.250
It would be all right
if you weren't.

34:18.170 --> 34:21.929
You've always been
my right hand in PRIDE.

34:21.929 --> 34:24.429
That's funny,
I thought you were mine.

34:27.440 --> 34:32.239
Things always ran flawlessly
because we ran them.

34:32.239 --> 34:35.449
Both of us know how to stay
focused on the big picture.

34:36.920 --> 34:38.920
It's all about the forest,
not the trees.

34:40.800 --> 34:45.179
You're saying my husband
screwing Janet Stein is a tree.

34:45.179 --> 34:47.770
When I had to make
hard decisions about Frank,

34:47.770 --> 34:50.190
the others questioned
my motives,

34:50.190 --> 34:51.860
but you stood by me.

34:52.989 --> 34:54.080
I did.

34:55.370 --> 34:57.160
And I'm here now,

34:57.160 --> 34:59.670
telling you it's time
to double down,

34:59.670 --> 35:00.960
not back off.

35:03.340 --> 35:05.430
I don't know if I can.

35:08.230 --> 35:09.860
I am just...

35:10.980 --> 35:13.780
I'm so angry.

35:13.780 --> 35:16.160
What if I told you
Janet and Robert

35:16.160 --> 35:18.120
were ending
their affair together?

35:19.590 --> 35:21.050
Would you take him back?

35:24.220 --> 35:26.100
It would mean so much to Jonah.

35:33.200 --> 35:36.990
Family is everything, isn't it?

35:48.180 --> 35:51.020
Do you think
this is made with agave?

35:51.020 --> 35:53.360
Are you Stacey Yorkes
all of a sudden?

35:53.360 --> 35:55.870
Well, processed sugar's
the devil's jet fuel.

35:55.870 --> 35:56.910
Uh...

36:05.720 --> 36:08.350
I'm glad to hear Victor's
taking care of his health.

36:09.980 --> 36:11.480
Now I need to know
that you're focused

36:11.480 --> 36:12.650
on the health of your marriage.

36:14.190 --> 36:16.780
And why do you need to know that?

36:17.950 --> 36:19.120
PRIDE isn't the only thing

36:19.120 --> 36:20.370
that's happening in the world.

36:20.370 --> 36:23.090
But it's the most important.

36:23.090 --> 36:25.840
Not just for us, but for
all of us.

36:25.840 --> 36:29.060
I think that you can leave
the rest of humanity

36:29.060 --> 36:31.440
out of my extramarital affair,
thank you.

36:36.740 --> 36:39.290
I was sad. I was lonely.

36:39.290 --> 36:41.830
So was Robert. It happened.

36:45.300 --> 36:46.340
And it's over.

36:47.970 --> 36:49.220
You'll tell him that.

36:49.220 --> 36:50.980
Unless you'd like to.

37:06.460 --> 37:08.680
Victor.

37:10.220 --> 37:12.230
‐ Hello.
‐ Robert.

37:12.230 --> 37:16.110
Listen, I never got
a chance to thank you.

37:16.110 --> 37:17.400
Uh...

37:17.400 --> 37:19.490
You took care of Janet
when I couldn't.

37:19.490 --> 37:20.740
I appreciate that.

37:22.830 --> 37:23.750
Okay.

37:30.560 --> 37:35.980
Listen, Victor, let go.

37:38.780 --> 37:41.990
We need to meet Chase's
physics teacher, remember?

37:41.990 --> 37:43.330
Oh, yeah.

37:56.150 --> 37:57.900
Oh, God.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.200
‐ Hey.
‐ What?

37:59.200 --> 38:00.950
‐ Isn't that Gert's club?
‐ Is it?

38:00.950 --> 38:02.870
‐ She was so excited about it.
‐ Yeah.

38:02.870 --> 38:06.080
I don't know if I'll
ever feel excitement again...

38:06.080 --> 38:09.970
laughter, joy.

38:09.970 --> 38:11.800
You know, if this is how I feel

38:11.800 --> 38:13.640
after just a little microdose
of Jonah,

38:13.640 --> 38:15.480
I can't imagine what Victor's
going through...

38:15.480 --> 38:18.110
‐ with that massive withdrawal, right?
‐ Yeah.

38:18.110 --> 38:21.030
Oh, great. This can't be good.

38:24.080 --> 38:26.250
‐ Hello, friends.
‐ Hi.

38:27.380 --> 38:28.960
You two finally got a minute?

38:32.510 --> 38:33.470
Yeah.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.580
What do the Wilders have to talk
to the Yorkes about?

38:44.740 --> 38:46.160
Must be about Molly.

38:46.160 --> 38:48.330
Text everyone to meet up.

38:49.800 --> 38:50.880
You do it.

38:53.430 --> 38:54.350
Fine.

38:56.100 --> 38:57.980
We made a mistake
not coming to you first.

38:57.980 --> 39:00.030
Well, that's an understatement.

39:00.030 --> 39:02.910
But we need to move quickly if we're
gonna keep it off Jonah's radar.

39:02.910 --> 39:04.280
Do you think Molly told Gert?

39:04.280 --> 39:05.490
I mean, they bicker a lot,

39:05.490 --> 39:06.830
but they're really quite close.

39:06.830 --> 39:08.420
‐ What about the other kids?
‐ Does Alex know?

39:09.920 --> 39:11.880
Honestly, we don't know.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.050
But we'll handle him.

39:13.050 --> 39:16.220
Just like you will handle Molly.

39:16.220 --> 39:18.650
‐ Handle?
‐ What exactly do you
mean by that?

39:18.650 --> 39:19.940
We don't want to hurt her.

39:19.940 --> 39:22.110
That's the whole point.

39:22.110 --> 39:25.280
This is more of an extraction,
a quarantine.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.450
Back in the day, I prepared
the Hernandezes' will.

39:27.450 --> 39:29.670
This morning, I remembered
something from it.

39:37.770 --> 39:41.730
No. No way.
We will not do that to her.

39:41.730 --> 39:43.650
How do you think
that'll make her feel?

39:43.650 --> 39:45.740
Safe. Protected.

39:45.740 --> 39:47.080
Alive.

39:48.830 --> 39:51.000
If Jonah finds out,

39:51.000 --> 39:52.920
hell, even if Tina does,

39:52.920 --> 39:54.630
there's no saying
what comes next.

40:04.950 --> 40:06.870
We know the Wilders
know about Molly.

40:06.870 --> 40:08.750
So, if they told the Yorkes...

40:08.750 --> 40:10.830
Then they're probably wondering
if we're talking.

40:10.830 --> 40:12.500
'Cause if Molly told me, then...

40:12.500 --> 40:14.510
You could've told all of us.

40:14.510 --> 40:17.050
We just need this goddamn thing
to decrypt.

40:17.050 --> 40:19.180
What happens when it does?

40:19.180 --> 40:22.150
Have you thought about that?

40:22.150 --> 40:24.860
Well, then it's out of our hands,
which I'm okay with.

40:26.110 --> 40:27.990
Yeah, me too.

40:27.990 --> 40:29.950
They did this.

40:29.950 --> 40:32.290
Exactly.

40:32.290 --> 40:35.170
They need to be held accountable
for their actions.

40:35.170 --> 40:37.890
Yeah, at least you'll still
have your dad.

40:37.890 --> 40:41.100
Super. Frank Dean can raise
us all.

40:42.730 --> 40:45.900
Being here tonight feels
totally ridiculous,

40:45.900 --> 40:48.870
like we're living fake lives
or something.

40:48.870 --> 40:51.580
- ‐ Yeah, well, we are...
- ‐

40:51.580 --> 40:54.920
...but shit's about
to get really real.

40:54.920 --> 40:58.600
Stay in touch tonight
in case anything happens.

41:00.270 --> 41:02.060
Great, thanks
for calming us down.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.570
Yup, really gonna sleep
well tonight.

41:16.380 --> 41:18.970
‐ Honey.
‐ Frank.

41:18.970 --> 41:21.640
Hey, I didn't know
you were here.

41:21.640 --> 41:24.520
Karolina's just going
to meet me at the car.

41:24.520 --> 41:26.110
Hmm.

41:26.110 --> 41:28.400
Well, I thought maybe
we could talk a little first.

41:32.160 --> 41:33.410
About this.

41:48.070 --> 41:49.700
Very nice to meet you.

41:49.700 --> 41:51.450
Thanks for your time, Coach.

41:51.450 --> 41:54.620
Take it easy. You've got a good
kid on your hands there.

41:54.620 --> 41:57.050
‐
‐

42:16.250 --> 42:18.630
What the...?

42:18.630 --> 42:22.260
On Monday, you are gonna make
a public apology to my son

42:22.260 --> 42:24.430
and reinstate him
to the lacrosse team.

42:24.430 --> 42:25.600
Do we have a deal?

42:25.600 --> 42:26.650
Sure, sure.

42:26.650 --> 42:28.530
Yeah? Good.

42:30.610 --> 42:31.530
Thank you.

42:42.430 --> 42:44.260
These Brentwood parents!

42:44.260 --> 42:46.600
You have to explain everything
to me now, Leslie.

42:46.600 --> 42:48.150
There are bits and pieces...

42:48.150 --> 42:51.660
I don't know if they're
visions or memories.

42:51.660 --> 42:53.700
I was starting to think
I was crazy,

42:53.700 --> 42:55.410
but this is not in my head.

42:56.830 --> 42:58.670
Frank, can we just talk
about this at home?

42:58.670 --> 43:00.250
I'm not sure I'm going home.

43:03.430 --> 43:04.890
Who is Jonah?

43:10.190 --> 43:13.950
Jonah came to my father
many years ago...

43:16.660 --> 43:20.670
confirming things that he'd been
thinking about his entire life.

43:22.470 --> 43:24.470
What things?

43:25.970 --> 43:29.730
What's really possible
in the world.

43:29.730 --> 43:32.240
And what is possible?

43:34.030 --> 43:38.080
Leslie, I've seen what Jonah can do.
The gloves?

43:38.080 --> 43:40.040
I know that's just the beginning.

43:42.010 --> 43:44.590
Is he what David wrote about?

43:46.050 --> 43:48.560
Is he the one who saw the full
Spectrum?

43:48.560 --> 43:50.060
Is he the Being?

43:53.320 --> 43:56.660
Yes. He is.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.500
And why keep that from me?

44:02.500 --> 44:04.550
No one loves the church
more than me, Leslie,

44:04.550 --> 44:05.760
and I want to be a part of this.

44:05.760 --> 44:09.560
You are a part of it, a big part.

44:09.560 --> 44:11.310
But you stepped into something

44:11.310 --> 44:13.480
that was already in motion...

44:13.480 --> 44:14.860
that was so big

44:14.860 --> 44:19.000
and involved me in a way that...

44:19.000 --> 44:20.870
maybe I was...

44:22.920 --> 44:24.300
or am...

44:26.340 --> 44:27.680
ashamed of.

44:29.310 --> 44:31.650
What do you have to be ashamed of?

44:38.950 --> 44:42.170
My relationship with Jonah.

45:08.600 --> 45:09.510
Hey.

45:13.270 --> 45:14.770
Have you seen Chase?

45:14.770 --> 45:16.820
I'm all turned around here.

45:16.820 --> 45:19.120
No. No, I haven't,

45:19.120 --> 45:22.410
but I'm glad to have
a minute with you.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.260
I don't understand why you're
not returning my calls.

45:29.260 --> 45:32.180
Oh, come on.

45:32.180 --> 45:35.020
Robert, we both know
how hard this has been.

45:35.020 --> 45:37.360
For both of us.

45:37.360 --> 45:39.570
But now that it's
all out in the open,

45:39.570 --> 45:40.660
we can move forward.

45:44.370 --> 45:45.790
What?

45:45.790 --> 45:49.300
When I think about it,
it was such a dumb dream.

45:50.640 --> 45:53.600
I... I was gonna spend my life

45:53.600 --> 45:55.650
doing research on gravitational
fields.

45:55.650 --> 45:58.030
Even just saying that out loud,
it sounds really embarrassing.

45:58.030 --> 45:59.990
It's not!
You could go back to that.

45:59.990 --> 46:01.410
No, um...

46:03.200 --> 46:04.960
I don't think I could.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.760
I'm Janet Stein now.

46:10.470 --> 46:11.930
For better or worse.

46:11.930 --> 46:13.350
Remember that vow?

46:17.940 --> 46:20.070
When he hurts you...

46:21.620 --> 46:24.290
‐ and Chase...
‐ Not anymore. He's changed.

46:24.290 --> 46:26.500
But you are locked
in a cycle of abuse.

46:26.500 --> 46:27.880
This is how it always goes.

46:27.880 --> 46:30.090
I appreciate
that you've clearly read

46:30.090 --> 46:33.180
a number of scholarly articles
and self‐help books,

46:33.180 --> 46:36.270
but this situation is impossible
to understand from the outside,

46:36.270 --> 46:38.570
so I'm not gonna try to explain it.

46:40.700 --> 46:43.080
I've been given an extra moment.

46:46.250 --> 46:48.170
I'm gonna take it.

46:50.510 --> 46:51.470
Goodbye, Robert.

47:35.260 --> 47:37.520
Guess I'm just gonna have
to carry this with me

47:37.520 --> 47:39.060
everywhere until it's finished.

47:39.060 --> 47:41.860
Well, if you've got
nothing else to do...

47:43.530 --> 47:44.820
while you wait,

47:44.820 --> 47:47.370
how about my mom's password?

47:49.290 --> 47:51.460
Don't think I've forgotten.

47:51.460 --> 47:54.340
Uh, no, I told you,
I just guessed.

47:54.340 --> 47:55.760
No. No, you didn't.

47:55.760 --> 47:56.760
You knew.

48:00.690 --> 48:02.230
And you're gonna tell me how

48:02.230 --> 48:03.820
right now.

48:10.960 --> 48:12.040
Hey, Moll.

48:12.040 --> 48:14.220
What's going on?

48:14.220 --> 48:17.430
Before you say anything,
please, let us just explain.

48:17.430 --> 48:19.560
Why is my stuff packed?

48:19.560 --> 48:23.780
Well, given your recent interest
in your heritage

48:23.780 --> 48:25.700
and birth parents
and things like that...

48:25.700 --> 48:27.910
We thought that you might
want to explore

48:27.910 --> 48:29.660
your roots just a little further.

48:29.660 --> 48:31.120
No.

48:31.120 --> 48:35.300
You have a second cousin
in Montebello.

48:35.300 --> 48:38.470
Her name is Graciela, and she's
so excited to have you come stay.

48:38.470 --> 48:40.180
‐Very excited.
‐Who is Graciela?

48:40.180 --> 48:43.820
She was very close
with your birth parents...

48:43.820 --> 48:45.110
Then why have I
never heard of her?

48:45.110 --> 48:47.110
‐Well...
‐Why are you guys doing this?

48:47.110 --> 48:50.000
‐You're giving me away?
‐Okay, that's not what's happening.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.710
‐What's wrong?
‐They're getting rid of me!

48:51.710 --> 48:53.500
‐That is not true.
‐Where? Why?

48:53.500 --> 48:55.720
We just thought
it would be best.

48:55.720 --> 48:57.340
Best for who? Not for her.

48:57.340 --> 49:01.100
Gert, there are things going on
you can't understand.

49:01.100 --> 49:02.940
Then explain it to me.

49:02.940 --> 49:05.030
You do realize this is
her worst nightmare!

49:05.030 --> 49:06.820
Listen to me.
This is difficult

49:06.820 --> 49:09.030
for everybody here, but we need...

49:09.030 --> 49:11.160
No, I won't! You can't!

49:11.160 --> 49:13.670
Yes, Molly, I can.

49:13.670 --> 49:15.000
Then try it!

49:16.090 --> 49:17.470
We need a minute.

49:31.410 --> 49:33.960
You can't use
your powers right here.

49:33.960 --> 49:35.840
I don't want to live
somewhere else.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.630
Why are they doing this to me?

49:37.630 --> 49:39.640
Because they know you saw.

49:39.640 --> 49:41.890
We all saw.

49:41.890 --> 49:44.350
Why'd I have to say
that stuff to the Wilders?

49:44.350 --> 49:45.610
It's okay. It's okay.

49:45.610 --> 49:47.150
We're gonna get you out of this.

49:47.150 --> 49:49.450
You just can't use
your powers right now,

49:49.450 --> 49:51.080
or else it's all gonna be worse.

49:51.080 --> 49:54.580
No, it's not.
This <i>is</i> the worst!

49:58.380 --> 50:00.220
Molly, you're gonna
get through this.

50:00.220 --> 50:02.560
You're the strongest
out of all of us,

50:02.560 --> 50:05.020
and I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen to you,

50:05.020 --> 50:06.020
not now, not ever.

50:07.400 --> 50:09.570
We're sisters.

50:09.570 --> 50:12.790
We're sisters forever, and nothing's
ever gonna change that.

50:22.470 --> 50:24.520
For now, you have to go.

50:43.810 --> 50:45.230
What are you doing in here?

50:48.150 --> 50:50.320
I thought we had an agreement.

50:50.320 --> 50:53.160
What?

50:53.160 --> 50:55.750
You were never supposed
to be in here without me.

50:55.750 --> 50:58.130
No, that's not...

50:59.590 --> 51:01.550
Sorry, I didn't think it was
a problem.

51:01.550 --> 51:04.310
I mean, we've been working together.
This is ours.

51:04.310 --> 51:05.220
Ours!

51:07.100 --> 51:09.900
That's funny.

51:11.860 --> 51:14.450
Was it your money
that paid for it?

51:16.160 --> 51:17.670
Was it your work,

51:17.670 --> 51:21.300
all the long hours when no one else
was interested,

51:21.300 --> 51:24.140
that brought this entire operation
into existence?

51:24.140 --> 51:26.390
‐This is exhausting.
‐What?

51:26.390 --> 51:28.560
I thought we were moving on
to something else.

51:28.560 --> 51:31.570
What? What were we moving on to?

51:33.150 --> 51:34.570
Father and son,

51:34.570 --> 51:36.490
playing together at the beach?

51:38.330 --> 51:39.630
I'm an idiot.

51:39.630 --> 51:42.550
I am making you a man!

51:43.800 --> 51:46.060
But you don't want that, do you?

51:46.060 --> 51:47.520
You want to be a baby.

51:47.520 --> 51:49.440
You did it again!

51:49.440 --> 51:51.650
You tricked me
into thinking you changed,

51:51.650 --> 51:53.820
but you know what, I'm done now.

51:53.820 --> 51:56.200
‐What?
‐It would've been better if you just...

52:01.550 --> 52:04.510
Dad. Dad, I'm sorry.

52:06.260 --> 52:07.930
Dad, don't.

52:23.250 --> 52:24.930
Dad, please.

52:29.270 --> 52:32.770
No. Please don't. Please.
