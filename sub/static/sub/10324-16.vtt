00:01.801 --> 00:04.429
[Man On TV]
Emergency personnel would like to reiterate...

00:04.537 --> 00:07.563
that the mud slide in question
is a natural disaster...

00:07.674 --> 00:10.700
not a giant alcoholic beverage.

00:10.810 --> 00:14.837
They ask that citizens please
stop driving toward it.

00:14.948 --> 00:19.578
And in lighter news, it's time to turn
our spotlight on a local loony.

00:19.686 --> 00:23.520
- Let's meetJoy Turner,
Camden's Loser of the Week.
- [Donkey Braying]

00:23.623 --> 00:26.990
<i>[Earl Narrating] There was a reason whyJoy</i>
<i>was on the Camden Loser of the Week segment...</i>

00:27.093 --> 00:28.993
<i>and it was all my fault.</i>

00:29.095 --> 00:32.724
<i>It started a few years back, when Joy was</i>
<i>making an audition tape for</i> Fear Factor.

00:32.832 --> 00:36.324
- Ow. Ow.
- <i>Unfortunately, I was responsible</i>
<i>for sending the tape in...</i>

00:36.436 --> 00:39.269
<i>and, well, it didn't quite make it there.</i>

00:40.640 --> 00:43.006
- [Laughing]
- <i>So I got her another shot...</i>

00:43.109 --> 00:47.944
<i>at being famous on a game show where</i>
<i>people could challenge Erik Estrada to anything.</i>

00:48.048 --> 00:51.540
<i>But instead ofbecoming famous,</i>
<i>she looked like a psycho.</i>

00:51.651 --> 00:56.452
<i>And even worse, I wound up blowing Darnell's</i>
<i>cover in the Witness Protection Program...</i>

00:56.556 --> 01:00.356
<i>which meant the whole family had to pack,</i>
<i>except for one member.</i>

01:00.460 --> 01:03.827
Now, as you all know from the flyers I put up,
Mr. Turtle remains lost.

01:03.930 --> 01:07.889
The good news is, I gave him plenty of
survival training, so I expect his imminent return.

01:08.001 --> 01:12.404
So here's his food, his favorite scarf
and his lip balm for the dry season.

01:12.505 --> 01:14.735
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Next thing we knew...</i>

01:14.841 --> 01:17.309
<i>the government snaps</i>
<i>Joy, Darnell and the boys away.</i>

01:17.410 --> 01:19.640
[Both Screaming]

01:19.746 --> 01:23.147
<i>And even though me and Randy were woozy</i>
<i>from the needles stuck in our necks...</i>

01:23.249 --> 01:25.274
<i>I still knew what I had to do.</i>

01:25.385 --> 01:27.819
I promised Joy I'd make
her dream come true.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.821
We gotta find 'em.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.823
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Which wasn't gonna be easy...</i>

01:31.925 --> 01:34.416
<i>'cause the Turner family was already</i>
<i>in a witness relocation facility.</i>

01:34.527 --> 01:37.394
I know it's small,
but it was good enough for Tupac.

01:37.497 --> 01:40.728
Uh, you didn't hear that.

01:44.404 --> 01:46.964
<i>My name is Earl.</i>

01:49.843 --> 01:53.904
<i>[Earl Narrating]Joy, Darnell and the kids</i>
<i>were waiting to start their new lives.</i>

01:54.013 --> 01:55.810
We have been locked in here for hours...

01:55.915 --> 01:57.883
no idea where we are or what happens next...

01:57.984 --> 01:59.713
and I still don't even know what you did...

01:59.819 --> 02:01.912
to get in the Witness Protection Program
in the first place.

02:02.021 --> 02:04.046
Nobody does, except for Mr. Turtle...

02:04.157 --> 02:06.057
and it's not like he's telling anybody.

02:06.159 --> 02:08.184
For one, because he's lost. And for two-

02:08.294 --> 02:11.491
- Well, you know. He's a turtle.
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>

02:11.598 --> 02:14.192
Mr. And Mrs. Turner.
Sorry to keep you waiting so long.

02:14.300 --> 02:18.464
Inside this packet you'll find
your new family identity.

02:18.571 --> 02:20.766
I'll give you a little time
to look it over.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.933
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

02:23.042 --> 02:26.443
- The Rosensteins?
- I do speak Hebrew.

02:26.546 --> 02:28.810
We're from Columbus. We bowl.

02:28.915 --> 02:32.009
Other hobbies include designing
clothes for our pet collie.

02:32.118 --> 02:34.313
Darnell, we gotta get somethin'
better than this.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.320
Joy, we're trailer park underachievers...

02:36.422 --> 02:38.322
with two hyperactive, prediabetic kids.

02:38.424 --> 02:40.221
How is this not better?

02:40.326 --> 02:42.226
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Since we didn't know where else to start...</i>

02:42.328 --> 02:44.853
<i>we combed the trailer park,</i>
<i>looking for any clue we could find.</i>

02:44.964 --> 02:47.398
<i>Then one walked right by us.</i>

02:48.968 --> 02:52.131
- Hey, Willie.
- Hey, Earl.

02:52.238 --> 02:54.832
Sorry I didn't see you over there.
You're on my bad side.

02:54.941 --> 02:58.377
Bad side? No way.
The side with the eye patch kicks ass.

02:58.478 --> 03:00.378
Any mail for the Turners?

03:00.480 --> 03:03.381
Nah. They must've moved,
because all their mail is being forwarded.

03:03.483 --> 03:05.917
- Any idea where their mail's going?
- Don't know.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.816
Just know it's being forwarded.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.821
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>That got me thinking.</i>

03:09.923 --> 03:12.915
<i>LfJoy and Darnell's mail was finding 'em,</i>
<i>I could too.</i>

03:13.026 --> 03:16.757
[Randy] You know, you spend years
hoping for an excuse...

03:16.863 --> 03:18.763
to mail yourself somewhere
in a cool wooden crate.

03:18.865 --> 03:22.096
But when you actually get in the crate,
it's not so glamorous.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.569
All this complaining,
and you guys are in a first-class box.

03:25.672 --> 03:28.573
Americans are so spoiled.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.040
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>While me and Randy were trying to get toJoy...</i>

03:31.144 --> 03:33.112
<i>Joy was trying to get</i>
<i>to the life she wanted.</i>

03:33.213 --> 03:36.705
- So you're not happy with
the name you've been given?
- That's right.

03:36.816 --> 03:39.341
You'd like your name to be Goldie Crystal?

03:39.452 --> 03:41.352
Well, my full name would be Goldilocks.

03:41.454 --> 03:43.752
And it's pronounced "Cristal,"
like what Diddy drinks.

03:43.856 --> 03:47.622
<i>I'm sorry. New identities are worked out</i>
<i>in a top secret wing of the Pentagon.</i>

03:47.727 --> 03:51.629
The names are the result of some
very complicated mathematical algorithms.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.894
Phyllis and Marty Rosenstein?
Look at this face.

03:55.001 --> 03:57.401
Do I look like a Phyllis to you? No.

03:57.503 --> 03:59.471
I look like the woman
Marty leaves Phyllis for.

03:59.572 --> 04:03.099
I'm just trying to help.
They don't have this in Columbus.

04:03.209 --> 04:06.372
I gotta be from someplace classy,
like Panama City Beach, Florida.

04:06.479 --> 04:09.915
And one more thing.
A lady like me don't make clothes for dogs.

04:10.016 --> 04:13.042
Only thing I ever sewed was
my stab wound on prom night.

04:13.152 --> 04:16.121
With all due respect, Mrs. Rosenstein...

04:16.222 --> 04:18.213
uh, things don't work that way.

04:18.324 --> 04:22.124
This is who you are now.
Give it some time. You'll get used to it.

04:24.697 --> 04:27.291
Not now.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.332
He wouldn't let me change
one mouse-fartin' thing.

04:31.437 --> 04:36.238
I guess I'm really gonna be Phyllis Rosenstein
for the rest of my life.

04:36.342 --> 04:38.902
It's just a name.
We're still the same people.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.776
Except we'reJewish now, and they're
considering changing my blood type.

04:41.881 --> 04:43.781
O positive.

04:43.883 --> 04:47.375
Mommy, did you get our new names changed?

04:47.487 --> 04:51.423
Ira, Lenny, I did all I could.

04:51.524 --> 04:53.458
<i>[Randy]</i>
<i>This is exciting.</i>

04:53.559 --> 04:55.584
Yeah, it kinda is, Randy.

04:55.695 --> 04:58.459
We haven't taken a trip
together in a long time.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.964
That's if you don't count
my dreams every night...

05:01.067 --> 05:03.558
where we visit all
the great places in the world.

05:03.670 --> 05:07.037
Last night we were on a safari.
You made love to a hippo.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.040
- You always make love in my dreams.
- <i>[Brakes Squealing]</i>

05:09.142 --> 05:11.610
- Huh.
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>

05:11.711 --> 05:13.338
Shh. Someone's comin'.

05:15.114 --> 05:17.014
Hey, Catalina!

05:17.116 --> 05:19.516
If that's you in there,
have a good vacation.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.922
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>We were on our way to get toJoy and Darnell...</i>

05:24.023 --> 05:26.958
<i>and we weren't the only ones</i>
<i>looking for 'em.</i>

05:32.498 --> 05:34.830
<i>While we were heading out</i>
<i>to find the Turners...</i>

05:34.934 --> 05:37.630
<i>the Turners were turning</i>
<i>into the Rosensteins.</i>

05:37.737 --> 05:40.228
Dag. I can't believe
it took me into my 30s...

05:40.340 --> 05:42.535
to find out I look this good in tweed.

05:42.642 --> 05:45.611
- [Together] Shalom, Dad.
- Shalom, boys.

05:45.712 --> 05:48.408
Baby, come out. Let's see who Marty
gets to cuddle with tonight.

05:53.619 --> 05:56.053
Oh, man.

05:56.155 --> 06:00.023
Perfect. No one will pay any attention
to you, especially men.

06:00.126 --> 06:03.186
I know. How could you do this to me?

06:03.296 --> 06:06.561
It's like you took an episode of that show
<i>The Swan</i> and ran it backwards.

06:06.666 --> 06:10.864
- Oh, my God. I'm a "before."
- Baby, we all gotta sacrifice.

06:10.970 --> 06:14.565
In a few days, they're gonna surgically
take my hair off and graft it to my face.

06:14.674 --> 06:16.904
<i>It's a new process.</i>
<i>We're very proud of it.</i>

06:17.009 --> 06:19.910
Here's a picture of what he'll look like.

06:20.012 --> 06:22.003
Oh, God!

06:22.115 --> 06:26.017
And we plan on you gaining 30 pounds.
Double-stuff tater skins?

06:26.119 --> 06:28.519
You're trying to turn me into a fatty.

06:28.621 --> 06:30.521
You're trying to mess with this?

06:30.623 --> 06:33.114
Oh, hell, no.
Hell, no!

06:33.226 --> 06:36.525
- Hell, no.
- Where is she going?

06:36.629 --> 06:39.723
Does she know we're in a bunker
half a mile under the Mall of America?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.900
Baby, you in here?

06:43.002 --> 06:46.369
[Sniffing]

06:46.472 --> 06:48.736
- It's hard to track her
when she's not chewing gum.
- [Sighs]

06:48.841 --> 06:51.469
I usually just follow the scent
of strawberry-kiwi Hubba Bubba.

06:51.577 --> 06:55.445
Listen, you gotta get her under control.
She's a risk, Harry.

06:55.548 --> 06:57.948
That's why you were advised to leave Camden
when you had the chance...

06:58.050 --> 06:59.984
so you wouldn't get mixed up
with people like her.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.054
That's my wife you're talking about.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.214
You were only supposed to be...
in Camden for six months.

07:04.323 --> 07:06.985
Now, if you'd taken that job
we had for you in Tokyo...

07:07.093 --> 07:09.960
you would've been the one who invented
Dance Dance Revolution.

07:10.062 --> 07:12.394
But you wanted to waste
your life in a trailer park.

07:12.498 --> 07:15.956
That wasn't a waste.
That was the best decision of my life!

07:18.037 --> 07:19.937
You could've left Camden?

07:22.442 --> 07:24.342
They wanted you to leave Camden...

07:24.444 --> 07:27.777
and go off to the glamorous beaches ofTokyo,
and you didn't do it?

07:27.880 --> 07:30.348
I couldn't leave my baby.

07:32.885 --> 07:34.910
I love you, Marty Rosenstein.

07:37.023 --> 07:41.255
I'll hold up my end of the deal,
no matter how much it hurts.

07:41.360 --> 07:45.694
I hear you. They're gonna snip off
the tip of my penis tomorrow.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.766
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Being in that box was fun at first.</i>

07:47.867 --> 07:51.997
<i>But six hours and three truck changes later,</i>
<i>the fun was wearing off.</i>

07:52.104 --> 07:54.004
This is horrible.

07:54.106 --> 07:57.837
I'm starving, and I already ate
the emergency jerky I keep in my cheek.

07:57.944 --> 07:59.844
All right, look.

07:59.946 --> 08:02.073
I was gonna save this for later, but-

08:03.249 --> 08:05.843
I caught a cricket.

08:05.952 --> 08:08.318
- You wanna split it?
- Yes, please.

08:08.421 --> 08:11.322
- What do you want, breast or thigh?
- Breast.

08:17.730 --> 08:21.962
Ew! This must be a female one.
I taste a little milk.

08:22.068 --> 08:25.003
I gotta taste something else
to make the flavor go away.

08:25.104 --> 08:26.799
You're not licking me.

08:28.474 --> 08:33.878
- [Electricity Crackling]
- Ow. Ow. Ow.

08:33.980 --> 08:36.642
Oh, my God.

08:36.749 --> 08:38.842
Randy, don't you see what's happening?

08:38.951 --> 08:41.010
Getting shocked, eating bugs-

08:41.120 --> 08:44.453
These are things Joy did
on her <i>Fear Factor</i> tape.

08:44.557 --> 08:46.718
Karma's punishing us
for ruining her dream.

08:46.826 --> 08:49.989
- <i>[Thud]</i>
- We're stopping.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.000
- I think we're here.
- What do we do now?

08:55.101 --> 08:57.160
Wait for 'em to open us.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.329
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Knowing all Darnell sacrificed for...</i>

08:59.438 --> 09:01.565
<i>Joy decided to be the best</i>
<i>Phyllis Rosenstein ever.</i>

09:01.674 --> 09:04.837
Okay. We're gonna start
with the grocery store.

09:04.944 --> 09:07.003
- [Beeps]
- <i>[Woman On P.A.] Price check on produce.</i>

09:07.113 --> 09:11.607
Excuse me, miss. You look so familiar.
Do I know you from somewhere?

09:11.717 --> 09:14.686
I don't know.
See if any of this rings a bell.

09:14.787 --> 09:18.052
I was raised in Columbus, Ohio,
but I was born in Sandusky.

09:18.157 --> 09:21.684
<i>I was bat mitzvahed at Temple Beth Torah.</i>
<i>Ooh, what a party.</i>

09:21.794 --> 09:25.025
Had my first dance
with Shmulkey Bernstein.

09:25.131 --> 09:27.531
He grabbed my tokus.

09:27.633 --> 09:30.363
- [Beeps]
- <i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>She memorized everything about Phyllis.</i>

09:30.469 --> 09:32.369
I've been designing for eight years.

09:32.471 --> 09:35.167
My company is called
"Collie Want a Cracker."

09:35.274 --> 09:38.801
I have to say my signature piece
is the Puppy Peacoat.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.072
- [Beeps]
- <i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>She even learned to speak Jewish.</i>

09:41.180 --> 09:44.638

<i>#Undercover</i>
<i>Undercover of the night ##</i>

isn't settling very well in my stomach.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.731
[Gagging]

10:06.839 --> 10:10.172
Oh, no. Joy threw up,
so karma's gonna make you throw up too.

10:10.276 --> 10:13.439
Don't worry, Earl. I'm not gonna throw-
[Retching]

10:13.546 --> 10:17.004
<i>Damn it, Randy! Now I'm gonna throw-</i>
<i>[Retching]</i>

10:22.722 --> 10:24.690
What the hell?

10:30.396 --> 10:33.331
- <i>[Owl Hooting]</i>
- Of course we're in a Dumpster.

10:33.432 --> 10:36.230
We covered Joy in garbage
on her audition tape.

10:36.335 --> 10:39.099
Whoa. This one's to Peter DickJohnson...

10:39.205 --> 10:41.332
that guy who used to live
in the trailer park.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.806
Remember how much we used
to make fun of his name?

10:43.909 --> 10:45.968
Those were some fun times.

10:46.078 --> 10:48.273
I heard he jumped in front of a train.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.906
All this stuff has been stamped "forward."

10:51.017 --> 10:54.783
Must be mail for people who moved.
The post office isn't forwarding it.

10:54.887 --> 10:59.984
Oh, man. And there's so many letters
in here for Santa Claus and God.

11:00.092 --> 11:03.255
They're gonna be pissed when they find out
they didn't get their mail...

11:03.362 --> 11:05.990
and those are two guys
you do not want to piss off.

11:06.098 --> 11:09.158
I can't believe karma would put us through
all this just to punish us.

11:09.268 --> 11:11.463
L-I mean the bugs and-and the box...

11:11.570 --> 11:13.697
and the throw up and all for nothin'?

11:13.806 --> 11:16.206
What the hell's goin' on?

11:28.621 --> 11:32.489
Son of a bitch.
It's a letter from <i>Estrada or Nada.</i>

11:35.861 --> 11:39.228
Joy could get another chance
to be on the show. Listen to this.

11:39.331 --> 11:41.526
"Send in this application...

11:41.634 --> 11:44.603
"a check for $50 made out
to Erik Estrada...

11:44.704 --> 11:47.832
and get your friends to text message
their vote for you."

11:47.940 --> 11:50.875
That's it, Randy.
That's why karma brought us here.

11:50.976 --> 11:52.876
If we can getJoy on that show again...

11:52.978 --> 11:55.344
she'll come back from anywhere
in the world to be on it.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.348
That's great, Earl.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.613
But where are we gonna find a check
that's already made out to Erik Estrada?

12:00.720 --> 12:03.120
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>In order to get toJoy, we started atJasper's.</i>

12:03.222 --> 12:06.282
Hey, somebody left a tooth
in this retainer.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.759
Yeah, it's a nice tooth.
You know, it's nicer than yours.

12:09.862 --> 12:13.025
<i>You know, if you pulled out your front tooth,</i>
<i>that thing would fit perfect.</i>

12:13.132 --> 12:16.568
- Good idea.
- I'll take these.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.603
Why the hell you need
all my cell phones, Earl?

12:18.704 --> 12:22.196
For text votin'. One of the Camden
contestants on <i>Estrada or Nada...</i>

12:22.308 --> 12:24.640
<i>had some bad mayonnaise</i>
<i>and died for three minutes.</i>

12:24.744 --> 12:27.440
He's alive now,
but in no shape to compete.

12:27.546 --> 12:30.140
Now they're havin' a contest
to see who's gonna replace him.

12:30.249 --> 12:34.151
Man, that's messed up.
Your one shot at fame- undone by a condiment.

12:35.721 --> 12:38.849
[Chuckles]
I feel smarter already.

12:38.958 --> 12:41.256
I'll be right back. My money's in the car.

12:44.997 --> 12:46.624
Oh, buddy.

12:46.732 --> 12:49.132
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>I passed out the cell phones to everyone I knew...</i>

12:49.235 --> 12:51.829
<i>and asked them to text their vote</i>
<i>forJoy to get a chance...</i>

12:51.937 --> 12:53.928
<i>to compete against Erik Estrada.</i>

12:54.039 --> 12:55.939
Sure, I'll text forJoy.

12:56.041 --> 12:59.067
Maybe if she comes out of hiding,
the bad guys'll kill her.

12:59.178 --> 13:01.339
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Everybody spent the next two days texting votes...</i>

13:01.447 --> 13:05.577
- <i>and crank calling each other.</i>
- [Phone Ringing]

13:05.684 --> 13:07.675
<i>By the time they were ready</i>
<i>to announce the winner...</i>

13:07.787 --> 13:09.812
<i>we had the whole Crab Shack</i>
<i>rooting forJoy.</i>

13:09.922 --> 13:12.117
Now it's time for the results
of the text-in votes...

13:12.224 --> 13:15.091
to see who will replace the victim
of the mayonnaise tragedy...

13:15.194 --> 13:17.924
go head-to-head with me
and find out if they're-

13:18.030 --> 13:20.294
[Grunts]

13:20.399 --> 13:22.924
<i>Estrada or Nada.</i>

13:23.035 --> 13:25.367
<i>And the winner is...</i>

13:25.471 --> 13:27.029
Joy Turner.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.039
[Cheering]

13:29.141 --> 13:31.473
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>And we weren't the only ones watching.</i>

13:31.577 --> 13:33.977
Joy Turner.

13:34.079 --> 13:39.711
Did you hear that? America has spoken,
and they've spoken for me.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.845
Baby, I feel terrible.
All I ever wanted to do is make you happy...

13:42.955 --> 13:46.789
and now I'm keeping you from your chance
to be famous and possibly be in <i>Parade</i> magazine.

13:46.892 --> 13:49.156
Are you kiddin' me?

13:49.261 --> 13:51.491
I'd rather be Phyllis Rosenstein...

13:51.597 --> 13:54.259
keep wearing these granny panties
and have my family...

13:54.366 --> 13:57.164
than whup Erik Estrada
and have nobody to share it with.

13:57.269 --> 13:59.999
Besides, we ain't allowed
to work today anyway.

14:00.105 --> 14:03.006
- It's Shabbas.
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>

14:03.108 --> 14:06.009
Marty, time to change
your blood type. Let's go.

14:06.111 --> 14:07.806
Okay.

14:09.915 --> 14:12.748
I love you, baby.

14:13.819 --> 14:14.843
- <i>[Groans]</i>
- <i>[Body Thuds]</i>

14:16.689 --> 14:18.316
[Gasps]
Darnell!

14:18.424 --> 14:21.052
You got the rest of your life
to be Phyllis Rosenstein.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.025
You deserve one more chance
to beJoy Turner.

14:23.128 --> 14:26.495
<i>Time to find out if you're</i>
Estrada or Nada.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.066
Woo-hoo!

14:33.272 --> 14:36.571
Where the hell is Joy?
Maybe she didn't see the commercial.

14:36.675 --> 14:40.577
Maybe she's here, but we don't know it
because they changed her identity.

14:40.679 --> 14:44.706
She could be anyone.
She could be a Chinese dude.

14:44.817 --> 14:47.081
She could be <i>that</i> Chinese dude.

14:47.186 --> 14:49.746
Joy. Joy! Joy!

14:49.855 --> 14:52.016
Joy! Joy!

14:54.159 --> 14:57.253
Joy!
It's not her.

14:57.363 --> 15:00.298
- I'm out of ideas.
- [Sighs]

15:00.399 --> 15:03.391
<i>[Earl Narrating] I was starting to think</i>
<i>this whole thing was a waste of time.</i>

15:03.502 --> 15:06.164
<i>But at least I wasn't onstage</i>
<i>getting humiliated.</i>

15:06.272 --> 15:08.467
Alas, poor Yorick.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.235
I knew him, Horatio.

15:10.342 --> 15:15.405
A man of infinite jest
and excellent fancy.

15:16.882 --> 15:19.282
[Audience]
Estrada!

15:19.385 --> 15:22.252
To be or nada to be!

15:22.354 --> 15:24.322
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Yeah!</i>

15:27.526 --> 15:30.893
Coming up next was supposed
to be Camden's Joy Turner...

15:30.996 --> 15:33.260
going head-to-head against Erik Estrada...

15:33.365 --> 15:36.129
to see who has the better
circus variety act.

15:36.235 --> 15:39.636
But unfortunately,
it looks likeJoy is a no-show.

15:39.738 --> 15:41.672
- <i>[Audience] Aw.</i>
- So I guess that means that Erik-

15:41.774 --> 15:45.642
Does this look like a no-show to you?
Erik Estrada, your ass is mine!

15:45.744 --> 15:48.235
- <i>[Audience Cheering]</i>
- Whoa. It is on now, people.

15:48.347 --> 15:50.838
- It is on!
- Yeah!

15:50.950 --> 15:52.918
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>And it was on.</i>

15:53.018 --> 15:55.111
<i>Joy did a weird, stretchy-singy thing.</i>

15:55.220 --> 15:58.815
#You got to know

- <i>[Clapping]</i>
- # Know when to fold 'em #

<i>#Know when to hop away</i>
<i>Know when to run ##</i>

16:06.198 --> 16:09.167
<i>[Earl Narrating] But Erik Estrada matched</i>

- <i>## [Latin]</i>
- <i>[Cheering, Applause]</i>

16:35.594 --> 16:37.494
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Joy got to pick the first tiebreaker...</i>

16:37.596 --> 16:42.363
<i>so she chose the body part</i>
<i>she used to win every fight-her mouth.</i>

16:42.468 --> 16:44.436
<i>[Cheering, Applause]</i>

16:45.738 --> 16:48.104
<i>But to her surprise,</i>
<i>Erik Estrada's nickname...</i>

16:48.207 --> 16:51.074
<i>wasn't "Hot Tongue"just</i>
<i>'cause he was a good kisser.</i>

16:53.579 --> 16:55.706

- <i>And when breathing fire didn't break the tie...</i>

"Everyone knows that East 105th Street

to make sure everybody else knew it too.

19:32.804 --> 19:36.171
Joy, we better go. Soon thousands of agents
will be swarming down on us.

And while that's cool
when you see it in a movie...

19:38.544 --> 19:41.536
it's not so cool when you're the one
being swarmed upon.

19:41.647 --> 19:44.514
Well, I guess this is it.

19:44.616 --> 19:47.585
I know I might've divorced you...

- Or "drimps."
