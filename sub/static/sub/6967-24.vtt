Rogeryour request for assistance.

00:17.064 --> 00:19.157
What is your
present location?

00:19.232 --> 00:20.893
Unit 50, go ahead.

00:20.967 --> 00:22.366
Suspect is now
westbound.

00:22.436 --> 00:24.063
Has entered the gate

00:24.137 --> 00:25.069
ofthe shipworks.

00:25.138 --> 00:27.402
Unit 50
still in pursuit. Over.

00:49.062 --> 00:57.333
Officer On Bullhorn:
Pull yourvehicle over and stop!

00:57.404 --> 01:00.840
Putyour hands on
the roofand freeze!

01:00.907 --> 01:03.034
Hold it!

01:05.212 --> 01:07.180
(Men Grunting)

01:07.247 --> 01:09.044
Get on the ground!

01:09.116 --> 01:10.344
Do it!

01:11.151 --> 01:12.209
Did you hear me?

01:12.285 --> 01:13.650
Face down!

01:13.754 --> 01:15.051
Do it!

01:17.391 --> 01:18.551
(Grunting)

01:21.261 --> 01:22.694
(Grunting)

01:30.971 --> 01:32.097
Stop!

01:32.172 --> 01:33.230
Armed officer!

01:33.306 --> 01:35.069
(Gunshots)

01:47.053 --> 01:48.748
I hit him.

01:48.855 --> 01:50.618
I know I hit him.

01:50.724 --> 01:52.521
Where the hell
did he go?

01:52.592 --> 01:55.322
He'd be bleeding bad.

02:55.355 --> 02:56.720
...offthe coast ofltaly.

02:56.790 --> 02:58.553
But theirs is a very
light lava.

02:58.625 --> 02:59.990
That's what stumped me.

03:00.060 --> 03:02.187
Because inside
there must be something

03:02.262 --> 03:04.127
the weight
ofthe heaviest rock.

03:04.197 --> 03:07.166
But, Professor, that would be
lcelandic peridotite.

03:07.234 --> 03:08.258
Precisely.

03:08.335 --> 03:10.132
There's a piece chipped off.

03:10.203 --> 03:11.261
By me.

03:11.338 --> 03:13.169
Well, what's
the rock inside?

03:13.273 --> 03:15.434
Icelandic peridotite,
naturally.

03:15.542 --> 03:17.976
When I saw this,
I stopped chipping.

Mulder.

03:23.817 --> 03:26.809
Areyou watching channel eight?

03:26.887 --> 03:28.582
What's your conclusion?

03:28.655 --> 03:30.714
Science does not
jump to conclusions.

03:30.790 --> 03:32.485
Science is not
a guessing game.

03:32.559 --> 03:35.722
Reporter:
...where a 60-mile
high-speed car chase

03:35.795 --> 03:37.592
ended early this evening--

03:37.664 --> 03:41.225
the suspect eluding capture
by leaping into the harbor

03:41.301 --> 03:44.293
but not before injuring
several Ardis police officers.

03:44.371 --> 03:46.999
We have Captain Roy Lacerio
standing by.

03:47.107 --> 03:48.631
How was the man
able to escape

03:48.742 --> 03:51.677
and how seriously injured
were the officers involved?

03:51.745 --> 03:53.713
Those details
are still unclear.

03:53.813 --> 03:55.610
I'll be talking
with several...

03:55.682 --> 03:57.673
I'm sorry--
You'll have to excuse me.

03:57.751 --> 04:00.686
Captain Roy Lacerio
being pulled away here

04:00.754 --> 04:02.881
during an intense manhunt.

04:07.394 --> 04:09.419
...Lacerio being
pulled away here

04:09.496 --> 04:11.123
during an intense...

04:11.197 --> 04:14.792
Mulder, you've been through
this tape 1 00 times.

04:14.868 --> 04:17.632
What exactly areyou
hoping to find?

04:17.704 --> 04:19.535
Mulder:
I don't know.

04:19.639 --> 04:21.834
And all he told you

04:21.942 --> 04:23.341
was to watch
channel eight?

04:23.410 --> 04:25.275
Yeah, that's all he said.

04:25.345 --> 04:27.540
Do we even know
why the suspect

04:27.614 --> 04:29.104
was being chased?

04:29.215 --> 04:30.341
As far as I can tell

04:30.417 --> 04:33.113
he wouldn't pull over
for a moving violation.

04:33.186 --> 04:34.676
Well, that should put him

04:34.754 --> 04:36.483
on the ten
most wanted list.

04:36.556 --> 04:38.217
There must be
something here.

04:38.291 --> 04:39.849
Some detail

04:39.926 --> 04:41.120
we're not seeing.

04:41.194 --> 04:46.928
How doyou know
he's notjustyanking your chain?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.195
Well, he has admitted
lying toyou.

04:49.269 --> 04:52.761
He wouldn't call
ifthere wasn't something here--

04:52.839 --> 04:55.535
something
he wants me to see.

04:57.310 --> 04:58.902
Then what areyou missing?

05:00.647 --> 05:02.581
There were three
law enforcement agencies

05:02.649 --> 05:04.014
out here last night.

05:04.084 --> 05:06.211
Hunting a man
on a moving violation?

05:06.286 --> 05:08.413
I know it's not
Silence OfThe Lambs

05:08.488 --> 05:09.819
but it's what we do.

05:09.889 --> 05:12.585
This man isn't wearing
a badge or a uniform.

05:12.659 --> 05:14.024
He's not one ofyours?

05:14.094 --> 05:15.083
No, sir.

05:15.161 --> 05:16.924
But it was
a zoo out here.

05:16.997 --> 05:18.897
You say the suspect
was shot.

05:18.965 --> 05:21.832
Why hasn't the body
been recovered?

05:21.901 --> 05:23.562
We got our search ongoing.

05:23.637 --> 05:26.071
We're quite certain
he will be found.

05:26.139 --> 05:28.266
It's been almost 1 8 hours,
Captain.

05:28.375 --> 05:29.865
Where could the body be?

05:29.976 --> 05:32.809
There are cables and debris
all over the bottom.

05:32.879 --> 05:34.437
It's a painstaking business.

05:34.547 --> 05:37.482
Can I askwhat the F.B.I.'s
interest in this case

05:37.550 --> 05:39.142
would be?

05:40.353 --> 05:42.344
The suspect matches
the description

05:42.422 --> 05:43.650
ofa federal fugitive.

05:43.723 --> 05:44.951
Really? How's that?

05:45.025 --> 05:48.017
No description ofthe suspect
has been released.

05:49.896 --> 05:51.989
Ifyou don't mind,
can we take a look

05:52.065 --> 05:52.997
at the car, please?

05:53.066 --> 05:56.092
It's been taken to impound.

05:56.169 --> 05:58.729
The report says that the car
was registered

05:58.805 --> 06:00.830
to a rental agency
in Gaithersburg.

06:00.940 --> 06:03.465
They had no idea
the carwas even missing.

06:03.576 --> 06:04.941
You know, Mulder

06:05.011 --> 06:07.479
I think that
we're wasting our time here.

06:07.547 --> 06:10.778
I don't know what the hell
I'm supposed to find.

06:17.157 --> 06:19.990
You can't make out the license plate
in this photo.

06:29.569 --> 06:31.059
Scully, look at this.

06:32.238 --> 06:33.967
What?

06:35.475 --> 06:39.206
Look at the car
in the photo.

06:39.279 --> 06:41.713
Look at the windshield.

06:44.217 --> 06:47.846
It's not the same car.

06:47.921 --> 06:49.582
Scully:
It's called a caduceus.

06:49.656 --> 06:51.089
It's the adopted symbol

06:51.157 --> 06:52.749
ofthe medical profession.

06:52.826 --> 06:55.954
So probably only a doctor
would have that on his car.

06:56.029 --> 06:57.087
Mm-hmm.

06:57.163 --> 06:58.460
I had the picture enhanced.

06:58.531 --> 06:59.862
The plate is different.

06:59.933 --> 07:01.662
"3 A-Y-F."

07:01.735 --> 07:03.225
Fast-forward.

07:03.303 --> 07:04.964
That's all you can make out.

07:05.038 --> 07:06.869
The rest is obscured.

07:07.941 --> 07:09.533
Hey, Danny, it's Mulder.

07:09.642 --> 07:12.736
Run a Maryland plate for me.

07:12.846 --> 07:14.074
All I got
is a partial.

07:14.147 --> 07:16.411
Registered to a doctor,
or used to be.

07:16.483 --> 07:18.007
Yeah, I'll hold.

07:18.084 --> 07:20.109
They switched cars
and lied about it.

07:20.186 --> 07:21.585
Whywould they do that?

07:21.654 --> 07:24.817
Maybe the real owner ofthe car
has something to hide.

07:28.695 --> 07:30.754

07:36.669 --> 07:38.227
Mulder:
Dr. Berube?

07:38.304 --> 07:39.396
Yes?

07:39.472 --> 07:40.769
We're with the F.B.I.

07:40.874 --> 07:42.102
Can we have a minute?

07:42.208 --> 07:43.334
I'm very busy.

07:43.443 --> 07:45.843
Areyou aware
that a car registered toyou

07:45.912 --> 07:47.880
was involved
in a high-speed chase

07:47.947 --> 07:49.073
in Ardis yesterday?

07:49.149 --> 07:50.116
Excuse me?

07:50.216 --> 07:51.581
A silver Ciera, Doctor.

07:51.651 --> 07:52.845
Doyou own one?

07:52.919 --> 07:53.851
Yes.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.319
It was used forwhat?

07:55.388 --> 07:56.412
A crime.

07:56.489 --> 07:57.956
Wereyou aware
it was even missing?

07:58.024 --> 07:59.184
Not until now.

07:59.259 --> 08:02.717
I have a housekeeper,
and she often uses the car.

08:02.796 --> 08:03.785
It's a second car...

08:03.863 --> 08:04.727
Please!

08:04.798 --> 08:06.197
They should
not be excited.

08:06.266 --> 08:08.097
Nothing should be touched.

08:08.168 --> 08:09.567
I thought theywere friendly.

08:09.636 --> 08:12.764
They're part
ofan experiment.

08:12.839 --> 08:13.328
What kind?

08:13.439 --> 08:14.098
Am I under

08:14.207 --> 08:15.868
some kind
ofsuspicion?

08:15.975 --> 08:17.943
No.

08:18.044 --> 08:20.069
Then I think I've answered
all your questions.

08:20.180 --> 08:24.514
Excuse me.
I have more work than time.

08:24.584 --> 08:26.051
Thankyou.

08:34.994 --> 08:35.926
Did he biteyou?

08:35.995 --> 08:38.259
No, but he tried to.

08:38.331 --> 08:39.592
Well, it's almost 5:00.

08:39.666 --> 08:41.895
Let's check
with the doctor's housekeeper

08:41.967 --> 08:42.991
about the car.

08:43.068 --> 08:43.763
No.

08:43.837 --> 08:45.702
No? What doyou mean?

08:45.772 --> 08:48.263
This has reached
the point ofabsurdity.

08:48.374 --> 08:50.171
We're out here on halfa hunch

08:50.276 --> 08:51.834
offa cryptic phone call

08:51.945 --> 08:54.778
chasing down a clue
that's based on speculation.

08:54.848 --> 08:56.782
Well, that's all we've got.

08:56.850 --> 08:58.181
That's all he's given us.

08:58.251 --> 09:00.242
Who is this
Deep Throat character?

09:00.320 --> 09:03.050
We don't know anything
about him.

09:03.122 --> 09:04.817
He's in a delicate position.

09:04.891 --> 09:06.518
He has access to information

09:06.593 --> 09:08.618
and indiscretion
could expose him.

09:08.695 --> 09:11.186
You don't know
that this isn'tjust a game.

09:11.264 --> 09:12.526
He's toying with you.

09:12.599 --> 09:13.998
Rationing out the facts.

09:14.067 --> 09:16.262
You think he does it
because he gets offon it?

09:16.336 --> 09:21.364
No. I think he does it
becauseyou do.

09:43.396 --> 09:45.023
Calling it a night

09:45.098 --> 09:47.293
Mr. Mulder?

09:47.367 --> 09:49.597
My mother usually likes me home

09:49.669 --> 09:51.967
before the street lights
come on.

09:52.038 --> 09:53.528
I'm surprised atyou.

09:53.640 --> 09:54.800
Why?

09:54.908 --> 09:57.274
Your level ofcommitment
seems to have diminished.

09:57.343 --> 09:58.674
My level ofcommitment?

09:58.745 --> 10:01.612
I expected thatyou'd be
working through the night

10:01.681 --> 10:03.410
putting the pieces together.

10:03.483 --> 10:06.213
Maybe ifyou'd given me
something more to workwith.

10:06.286 --> 10:07.776
I've given you all I can.

10:07.854 --> 10:08.786
A news report?

10:08.855 --> 10:10.220
And where has it led you?

10:10.290 --> 10:11.348
Not very far.

10:11.424 --> 10:13.551
It may be further
than you realize.

10:13.626 --> 10:15.651
This has always been
on your terms.

10:15.728 --> 10:17.218

the Obi Wan Kenobi crap

10:20.566 --> 10:22.124
and save me the trouble.

10:22.201 --> 10:24.999
I fearyou've become
too dependent on me.

10:25.071 --> 10:26.629
Look, I've got
plenty to do

10:26.739 --> 10:28.900
without chasing down
yourvague leads

10:29.008 --> 10:31.442
or trying to decode
your circular logic.

10:31.511 --> 10:34.309
Maybe it's you who's become
too dependent on me--

10:34.380 --> 10:36.473

to playyour games.

10:40.286 --> 10:42.584

10:42.655 --> 10:43.815

10:43.890 --> 10:46.825
Don't give up on this one.

10:46.893 --> 10:48.190
Trust me.

10:48.261 --> 10:50.024

11:33.239 --> 11:35.298
Has he contacted you?

all your questions.

11:50.723 --> 11:52.657

12:28.061 --> 12:29.528
I'm calling it off.

12:29.595 --> 12:32.120
Let's get those guys
out ofthe water.

12:32.198 --> 12:34.257
Yes, sir.
Bring it in.

13:14.674 --> 13:18.576
Scully:
The county sheriffs office
is conducting the investigation.

13:18.644 --> 13:20.236
On the preliminary
reports

13:20.313 --> 13:22.281
it's being listed
as a suicide.

13:22.348 --> 13:23.474
Suicide?

13:23.549 --> 13:25.676
They think that,
forwhatever reason

13:25.785 --> 13:28.117
he trashed his lab
and then killed himself.

13:28.221 --> 13:29.347
How?

13:29.455 --> 13:32.947
He tied one end
ofa roll ofmedical gauze

13:33.059 --> 13:34.754
around his neck

13:34.827 --> 13:37.387
and the other end
to this gas outlet.

13:37.463 --> 13:39.556
Then hejumped.

13:39.632 --> 13:41.122
Were there anywitnesses?

13:41.200 --> 13:42.132
Nope.

13:42.201 --> 13:43.190
He kept this place

13:43.269 --> 13:45.203
Iike he was waiting
for the people

13:45.271 --> 13:47.205
from Good Housekeeping
to show up.

13:47.273 --> 13:49.798
I would never have pegged him
to do this...

13:49.876 --> 13:51.867
or a Greg Louganis
out the window.

13:51.944 --> 13:54.378
Scully:
I know. That gauze is troubling.

13:54.447 --> 13:57.007
It's a bit too calculated, huh?

13:57.083 --> 14:00.075
As ifsomeone wanted
to make doubly sure

14:00.186 --> 14:03.553
he'd break his neck
before he hit the ground.

14:03.623 --> 14:06.456
What else do we know
about Dr. Berube?

14:06.526 --> 14:08.187
Um...

14:08.261 --> 14:09.728
"Terrence Allen Berube.

14:09.829 --> 14:11.194
Harvard Med, 1 974."

14:11.264 --> 14:12.424
He was working

14:12.498 --> 14:14.363
on the Human
Genome Project.

14:14.433 --> 14:16.094
Areyou familiar
with that?

14:16.169 --> 14:18.467
Yeah. The mapping
ofall human genes.

14:18.538 --> 14:20.904
Maybe the most ambitious
scientific endeavor

14:20.973 --> 14:22.668
in the history
ofmankind.

14:24.677 --> 14:26.941
There's nothing
extraordinary about that.

14:27.013 --> 14:28.810
There were
thousands ofscientists

14:28.881 --> 14:30.178
working on that project.

14:30.249 --> 14:32.547
But only one
who owned a silver Ciera

14:32.652 --> 14:34.313
and went bungeejumping

14:34.420 --> 14:37.082
with medical gauze
wrapped around his neck.

14:37.190 --> 14:38.987
I'm seeing the pieces

14:39.025 --> 14:41.459
but I'm not seeing
the connection.

14:41.527 --> 14:43.051
Mulder:
Maybe that'sjust it.

14:43.129 --> 14:44.494
Maybe we're not seeing it

14:44.564 --> 14:47.362
because it can't be seen,
not in any obvious way.

14:47.433 --> 14:48.593
What is this?

14:48.668 --> 14:50.659
I don't know.

14:50.736 --> 14:52.203
Can you find out?

14:52.271 --> 14:53.863
What will you do?

14:53.940 --> 14:57.341
I'll see what else
I can find out about Dr. Berube.

14:57.410 --> 14:59.878
Okay, Mulder,
but I'm warning you.

14:59.946 --> 15:03.347
Ifthis is monkey pee,
you're on your own.

15:24.737 --> 15:27.797
(Doorbell Rings)

16:03.309 --> 16:04.901
My first impression is

16:04.977 --> 16:07.241
it's some kind
ofbacteria specimen.

16:07.313 --> 16:09.338
Can I askyou
whereyou got it?

16:09.415 --> 16:12.873
It was recovered
at a crime scene.

16:12.985 --> 16:15.146
We've come a long way

16:15.254 --> 16:18.917
from Colonel Mustard in the den
with a rope, haven't we?

16:19.025 --> 16:20.253
I'm expecting

16:20.326 --> 16:22.317
it will turn out
to be nothing.

16:22.428 --> 16:25.022
No. You've definitely
got something here.

16:25.097 --> 16:26.792
Wow. Look at this.

16:26.866 --> 16:28.299
Scully:
What are they?

16:28.367 --> 16:30.733
They're the size
ofbacteria

16:30.803 --> 16:33.636
but no bacteria
I've ever seen.

16:33.706 --> 16:34.866
How doyou mean?

16:34.940 --> 16:38.706
Well, most bacteria are
symmetrical and smooth.

16:38.778 --> 16:41.804
These are...

16:41.881 --> 16:44.941
I don't know. It's strange.

16:45.017 --> 16:47.281
You have no way
ofidentifying them?

16:47.386 --> 16:49.047
Well, we could do
a freeze fracture.

16:49.155 --> 16:50.520
Take a thin slice off

16:50.589 --> 16:52.682
and see what's going on
inside these babies...

16:52.792 --> 16:54.657
ifyou don't mind
waiting.

16:54.727 --> 16:56.285
No. No, I'll wait.

17:18.451 --> 17:20.976
Hi, Danny.
Yeah, it's Mulder again.

17:21.087 --> 17:23.055
Look,
I've got a number this time--

17:23.122 --> 17:25.488
555-2804, area code 301 .

17:25.558 --> 17:29.153
I need an address,
a name ifyou can get it for me.

17:29.228 --> 17:30.957
All right. I'm at, uh...

17:31.030 --> 17:32.588
same prefix, 1 51 7.

17:32.665 --> 17:34.360
All right. Thanks, Danny.

17:51.550 --> 17:53.541
(Ringing)

17:53.619 --> 17:55.052
Mulder:
That was fast.

17:55.121 --> 17:58.215
Man's Voice:
Terry, is thatyou?

17:58.324 --> 18:00.053
Yeah.

18:00.126 --> 18:01.650
Who's this?

18:01.761 --> 18:03.592
They shot me, Terry.

18:03.662 --> 18:04.822
Oh, God.

18:04.897 --> 18:07.161
I've been in the water
for three days.

18:07.233 --> 18:08.165
I'm hurt.

18:08.234 --> 18:09.724
Where areyou now?

18:09.802 --> 18:10.962
At a pay phone.

18:11.036 --> 18:12.936
I'll pickyou up. Where areyou?

18:13.005 --> 18:13.972
Terry...

18:15.508 --> 18:17.840
You okay?

18:17.910 --> 18:19.104
Areyou there?

18:19.178 --> 18:21.043
Hello?

18:21.113 --> 18:22.910
Hello. This man's
been hurt here.

18:22.982 --> 18:24.847
I think he needs
medical attention.

18:24.917 --> 18:26.748
What's the street?
What's the street?

18:26.852 --> 18:28.820
I'm going to call
an ambulance.

18:28.921 --> 18:29.979
Sir?

18:33.159 --> 18:35.389
(Telephone Ringing)

18:35.461 --> 18:36.325
Don't hang up.

18:36.395 --> 18:37.487
You got it.

18:37.630 --> 18:38.722
Hi, Danny.

18:38.831 --> 18:39.923
I got it.

18:40.032 --> 18:42.364
Let me get the address.

18:42.435 --> 18:45.598
All right, you ready?
Mulder?

18:45.671 --> 18:47.901
I'm just writing it down now.
Go ahead.

18:47.973 --> 18:50.908
Belongs to a company called
Zeus Storage. 1 61 6 Pandora.

18:50.976 --> 18:53.035
Zeus Storage. Yeah.

18:53.112 --> 18:55.637
1 61 6 Pandora Street.

18:55.714 --> 18:56.646
That's it.

18:56.715 --> 18:58.546
All right, thanks.

19:02.254 --> 19:04.222
(Siren Wailing)

19:06.025 --> 19:07.959
Medic:
White male, 40,
weakvitals

19:08.027 --> 19:10.325
severe dyspnea
and hypotension.

19:10.429 --> 19:12.021
He also has
a green fuid

19:12.131 --> 19:13.359
coming from a wound

19:13.466 --> 19:14.490
right upper quadrant.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.568
Doctor:
ls he responding to CPR?

19:16.635 --> 19:19.126
No, and we're noticing
rope veins at the neck

19:19.238 --> 19:21.570
and a hypersonant
sounding chest.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.574
He's going real blue
on us now.

19:23.642 --> 19:25.667
Release the air
pressing on the heart cavity.

19:25.744 --> 19:28.008
I'm going to need
a cannula.

19:28.080 --> 19:31.572
We're going to do
a needle decompression.

19:34.553 --> 19:36.453
(Air Rushes Out)

19:36.522 --> 19:37.454
Ah...

19:37.523 --> 19:39.514
(Coughing)

19:45.197 --> 19:47.358
Doctor:
What's going on in there?

19:47.466 --> 19:52.130
(Coughing)

19:55.074 --> 19:56.564
Answer me.

19:58.244 --> 20:00.144
What is the problem?

20:01.280 --> 20:03.043
Come in, please!

20:03.115 --> 20:05.242
(Telephone Ringing)

20:05.317 --> 20:06.648
Mulder.

20:06.719 --> 20:08.016
It's me.

20:08.087 --> 20:09.520
He's alive, Scully.

20:09.588 --> 20:10.452
Who?

20:10.523 --> 20:12.218
The driver ofthe silver Ciera.

20:12.291 --> 20:14.020
He called the doctor's house.

20:14.093 --> 20:15.082
Where is he now?

20:15.160 --> 20:17.151
I don't know. Where areyou?

20:17.229 --> 20:20.130
I'm at the Georgetown
Microbiology Department.

20:20.199 --> 20:21.996
I've got something foryou.

20:22.067 --> 20:24.297
Is it smaller
than a silver Ciera?

20:24.370 --> 20:25.302
Much.

20:25.371 --> 20:27.305
And it's not silver.
It's green.

20:27.373 --> 20:28.670
What is it?

20:28.741 --> 20:31.835
Some kind ofbacteria,
each containing virus.

20:31.911 --> 20:34.880
Berube may have been
cloning them.

20:34.947 --> 20:37.939
They also contain something
that looks like chloroplasts--

20:38.017 --> 20:39.245
plant cells.

20:39.318 --> 20:41.081
They've never seen
anything like it.

20:41.153 --> 20:43.451
What could he have
been doing with them?

20:43.522 --> 20:46.514
The only reason you clone
a virus inside a bacteria

20:46.592 --> 20:48.958
is to inject it
into something living.

20:49.028 --> 20:50.552
It's called gene therapy

20:50.663 --> 20:53.359
and it's still
highly experimental.

20:53.465 --> 20:56.332
Maybe that's what he was doing
with those monkeys.

20:56.402 --> 20:58.199
Can they tell you anything else?

20:58.270 --> 21:01.398
They'rejust about to run
some primary cell cultures

21:01.473 --> 21:02.906
and a DNA sequence.

21:02.975 --> 21:07.469
Now, I may be understating
the strangeness ofthis, Mulder.

21:07.546 --> 21:09.104
Bacteria like this--

21:09.181 --> 21:12.981
it may have existed,
but not for millions ofyears...

21:13.052 --> 21:17.284
not since before our ancestors
first crawled out ofthe sea.

21:20.025 --> 21:22.016
Areyou there, Mulder?

21:24.396 --> 21:25.795
Yeah.

21:25.864 --> 21:27.593
Scully, keep up
the good work.

23:39.198 --> 23:40.290
Agent Scully.

23:40.399 --> 23:43.232
Oh, Dr. Carpenter,
I fell asleep.

23:43.302 --> 23:44.860
I've done some work.

23:46.905 --> 23:48.839
These are
the DNA sequences

23:48.907 --> 23:51.933
from the bacteria sample
you brought in.

23:52.010 --> 23:54.444
You know something
about molecular biology.

23:54.513 --> 23:55.844
What areyou
looking at?

23:55.914 --> 23:58.439
I think
those are genes.

23:58.517 --> 24:00.644
Right.
They're called base pairs.

24:00.719 --> 24:02.016
Each pair is made up

24:02.087 --> 24:04.248
ofsomething
called a nucleotide.

24:04.323 --> 24:07.019
Only four nucleotides
exist in DNA, four.

24:07.092 --> 24:09.322
And through
some miracle ofdesign

24:09.428 --> 24:11.123
that we haveyet
to fathom

24:11.230 --> 24:13.221
every living thing
is created

24:13.332 --> 24:16.301
out ofthese four
basic building blocks.

24:16.368 --> 24:20.168
Whatyou're looking at
is a sequence ofgenes

24:20.239 --> 24:22.366
from the bacteria sample.

24:22.441 --> 24:26.309
Normally, we'd find no gaps
in the sequence.

24:26.378 --> 24:30.007
But with these bacteria,
we do.

24:30.082 --> 24:31.515
Why is that?

24:31.583 --> 24:32.811
I don't know why.

24:32.885 --> 24:36.013
But I tell you,
under any other circumstances

24:36.088 --> 24:39.319
my first call would have been
to the government.

24:39.391 --> 24:41.882
What exactly did you find?

24:43.762 --> 24:46.890
A fifth and sixth
DNA nucleotide--

24:46.999 --> 24:48.762
a new base pair.

24:48.834 --> 24:50.199
Agent Scully

24:50.269 --> 24:52.760
whatyou
are looking at

24:52.871 --> 24:55.669
it exists nowhere in nature.

24:55.741 --> 24:59.336
It would have to be
by definition...

24:59.411 --> 25:02.141
extraterrestrial.

25:59.271 --> 26:02.263
(Ringing)

26:10.482 --> 26:11.574
Hello.

26:11.650 --> 26:14.346
Mulder? Where on God's Earth
haveyou been?

26:14.419 --> 26:16.819
I've been trying
to call you all night.

26:16.889 --> 26:18.186
I had a situation.

26:18.257 --> 26:20.384
I left my phone in the car.

26:20.459 --> 26:22.154
Mulder...

26:22.227 --> 26:24.320
that bacteria I had analyzed--

26:24.429 --> 26:28.763
They're saying
that it doesn't exist in nature.

26:30.335 --> 26:32.735
They're saying that it
could be extraterrestrial.

26:32.804 --> 26:34.169
Scully...

26:34.239 --> 26:35.900
What?

26:35.974 --> 26:37.441
How soon can you be here?

26:37.509 --> 26:39.602
There's something
I gotta showyou.

26:56.795 --> 26:58.763
Wait a second.

26:58.830 --> 27:00.559
Mulder...

27:03.001 --> 27:05.492
I just want to say
that I was wrong.

27:05.570 --> 27:07.765
That's all right.
Don't worry about it.

27:07.839 --> 27:09.932
No, um...

27:10.042 --> 27:13.603
ifyou'd have listened to me,
we wouldn't be here right now.

27:13.712 --> 27:16.704
I should know by now
to trustyour instincts.

27:16.815 --> 27:18.476
Why? Nobody else does.

27:20.052 --> 27:22.316
You know,
I've always held science

27:22.387 --> 27:23.615
as sacred.

27:23.689 --> 27:27.250
I've always put my trust
in the accepted facts.

27:27.326 --> 27:29.419
And what I saw last night...

27:29.494 --> 27:34.227
for the first time in my life,
I don't know what to believe.

27:34.299 --> 27:37.598
Whatever it is
you do believe, Scully

27:37.669 --> 27:40.467
when you walk into that room...

27:40.539 --> 27:43.007
nothing sacred will hold.

27:58.957 --> 28:00.891
There were tanks here...

28:00.959 --> 28:03.484
and five bodies
suspended in solution.

28:03.562 --> 28:05.996
There were computers
monitoring them.

28:06.064 --> 28:08.532
Theywere alive, Scully,
underwater.

28:08.600 --> 28:10.830
What happened to them?

28:10.902 --> 28:12.927
God only knows.

28:13.005 --> 28:14.233
Most likely

28:14.306 --> 28:16.774
they've been destroyed.

28:16.842 --> 28:17.934
Miss Scully.

28:18.043 --> 28:19.977
We met
ever so briefy.

28:20.045 --> 28:21.239
Destroyed bywhom?

28:21.346 --> 28:22.540
I don't know.

28:22.614 --> 28:23.945
I don't believeyou.

28:24.016 --> 28:26.177
There are limits
to my knowledge

28:26.251 --> 28:27.479
Mr. Mulder.

28:27.552 --> 28:29.315
Inside the intelligence
community

28:29.388 --> 28:31.754
there are so-called
black organizations--

28:31.823 --> 28:34.519
groups within groups
conducting covert activities

28:34.593 --> 28:36.561
unknown at the highest
levels ofpower.

28:36.628 --> 28:38.687
There were three men--
I was chased.

28:38.764 --> 28:40.891
Ifyou were chased,
you would have been killed.

28:40.966 --> 28:42.797
Those men
are trained well

28:42.868 --> 28:45.234
for that sort
ofbusiness.

28:45.303 --> 28:47.066
Were those
the same men

28:47.139 --> 28:48.800
who killed
Dr. Berube?

28:48.874 --> 28:49.806
Presumably.

28:49.908 --> 28:51.205
Why?

28:51.309 --> 28:52.367
Why? Good Lord.

28:52.477 --> 28:53.774
You've worked so hard

28:53.845 --> 28:56.040
and you still
don't see it.

28:56.114 --> 28:58.048
Dr. Berube was conducting
human experiments

28:58.116 --> 28:59.447
with extraterrestrial viruses.

28:59.518 --> 29:01.850
Yes, but that's been going on
foryears.

29:01.920 --> 29:03.751
We've had the tissue since 1 947

29:03.822 --> 29:05.687
but not
the technology.

29:05.757 --> 29:06.781
Roswell?

29:06.858 --> 29:08.587
Roswell was a smoke screen.

29:08.660 --> 29:11.857
We've had a halfa dozen
better salvage operations.

29:11.930 --> 29:13.261
Dr. Berube was killed

29:13.331 --> 29:15.561
because his work
was too successful.

29:15.634 --> 29:17.295
You're standing
in the room

29:17.369 --> 29:19.530
where the first
DNA transplant took

29:19.604 --> 29:22.266
the first human-alien
hybrid was created.

29:22.374 --> 29:24.137
Six volunteer patients

29:24.242 --> 29:25.675
all terminally ill.

29:25.744 --> 29:27.905
One, Dr. William Secare,
an old friend

29:28.013 --> 29:29.241
of Dr. Berube's

29:29.314 --> 29:31.282
was dying
ofmelanoma cancer.

29:31.383 --> 29:33.442
And as a result

29:33.518 --> 29:34.951
ofthe E.T.
gene therapy

29:35.020 --> 29:37.250
all six patients
treated in this room

29:37.322 --> 29:39.688
began to recover
from their illnesses.

29:39.758 --> 29:41.282
Dr. Secare
was able to live

29:41.359 --> 29:43.190
a more or less
normal life--

29:43.261 --> 29:44.660
as normal as possible

29:44.729 --> 29:47.391
for a man who has developed
inhuman strength

29:47.466 --> 29:49.525
and the ability
to breathe underwater.

29:49.601 --> 29:53.765
That's how he eluded capture.

29:53.839 --> 29:56.069
What was he running from?

29:56.174 --> 30:00.270
Dr. Secare was never
supposed to have survived.

30:00.378 --> 30:01.902
Dr. Berube's research was part

30:02.013 --> 30:05.414
ofa top secret
government project.

30:05.484 --> 30:08.044
All theywere interested in
was the technology.

30:08.120 --> 30:11.453
To have a hybrid living
out in the real world--

30:11.523 --> 30:13.047
too great a liability.

30:13.125 --> 30:14.683
What ifhe should need

30:14.759 --> 30:16.056
emergency
medical procedure?

30:16.128 --> 30:18.358
The man has
a blood chemistry

30:18.430 --> 30:20.864
that is alien

30:20.932 --> 30:22.092
and very likely toxic.

30:22.167 --> 30:23.930
That story should hit the press.

30:24.002 --> 30:25.993
It was easier
to kill Dr. Secare.

30:26.071 --> 30:26.935
Ofcourse.

30:27.005 --> 30:28.836
There was only one problem.

30:28.907 --> 30:30.636
Dr. Berube was able
to warn him.

30:30.742 --> 30:33.142
There'sjust one thing
I don't understand--

30:33.211 --> 30:36.180
whyyou gave us so little
to go on in the beginning.

30:36.281 --> 30:38.374
And why areyou
giving us so much now?

30:38.450 --> 30:40.884
I didn't anticipate
the speed and precision

30:40.952 --> 30:42.476
oftheir cleanup operation.

30:42.554 --> 30:45.455
They're systematically
destroying all the evidence--

30:45.524 --> 30:47.116
Dr. Berube, the bodies here.

30:47.192 --> 30:48.250
Without the evidence

30:48.326 --> 30:49.816
you two
have no case.

30:49.895 --> 30:51.954
Who would believe
the story

30:52.030 --> 30:53.224
I just told you?

30:53.298 --> 30:54.959
You must put together

30:55.033 --> 30:56.762
everything thatyou have found

30:56.835 --> 30:59.463
and you must find Dr. Secare
before they do.

30:59.538 --> 31:03.497
I'll have no further contact
with you on this matter.

31:10.348 --> 31:12.282
I'm going to get back
to Georgetown

31:12.350 --> 31:14.284
and get
all the lab work.

31:14.352 --> 31:16.081
I'm going to find
Dr. Secare.

31:16.154 --> 31:17.280
Where?

31:17.355 --> 31:19.346
I don't know.
I'm going to trust my instincts.

31:26.898 --> 31:29.025
I'm looking
for Dr. Ann Carpenter.

31:29.100 --> 31:31.534
I've been unable
to reach her by phone

31:31.603 --> 31:33.264
and she's not in her office.

31:33.338 --> 31:35.533
She was
in a terrible car accident...

31:35.640 --> 31:36.834
herwhole family.

31:36.942 --> 31:41.970
And Dr. Carpenter
is, um, dead.

31:56.761 --> 31:58.991
(Thump)

32:17.682 --> 32:19.775
(Thump)

32:31.263 --> 32:33.231
Dr. Secare?

32:49.180 --> 32:50.374
Wait!

32:57.656 --> 32:59.886
I'll protectyou.

32:59.958 --> 33:01.186
(Gunshot)

33:05.297 --> 33:07.128
(Air Rushes Out)

33:07.198 --> 33:08.825
Ah...!

33:11.670 --> 33:13.501
(Coughing)

33:17.809 --> 33:20.209
(Ringing)

33:41.032 --> 33:44.695
Your cellular phone's
been ringing offthe hook.

33:44.769 --> 33:47.567
I'm a popular guy.

33:47.639 --> 33:49.698
Why don'tyou answer it for me?

33:49.808 --> 33:52.936
Oh, I don't like
talking on the phone.

33:53.044 --> 33:55.376
I have this thing
about unsecured lines.

33:55.447 --> 33:58.439
When you feel
like talking

33:58.550 --> 34:00.450
Iet me know, though.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.625
He's not home.

34:17.702 --> 34:18.964
Where is he?

34:19.036 --> 34:20.368
He's been gone
all night.

34:20.438 --> 34:21.905
I wish I knew.

34:21.973 --> 34:23.463
Something's
happened to him.

34:23.541 --> 34:24.871
Theywon't kill him.

34:24.976 --> 34:26.500
How doyou know that?

34:26.610 --> 34:28.272
He's become too high-profile

34:28.380 --> 34:31.474
and you've got evidence
that could expose them.

34:31.616 --> 34:32.480
They took the evidence

34:32.550 --> 34:35.074
and they may have killed
in order to get it.

34:35.152 --> 34:36.643
The evidence
still exists.

34:36.721 --> 34:37.619
Where?

34:37.688 --> 34:39.850
It might be difficult
to obtain

34:39.924 --> 34:42.255
but with your
medical background

34:42.327 --> 34:44.123
I might be able
to getyou inside.

34:44.195 --> 34:45.127
Inside where?

34:45.196 --> 34:46.925
The high-containment facility

34:46.998 --> 34:48.226
at Fort Marlene, Maryland.

34:48.299 --> 34:49.596
What do they have there?

34:49.667 --> 34:51.793
The wellspring, Miss Scully--

34:51.870 --> 34:53.201
the original tissue.

34:53.271 --> 34:55.239
Ifthey've got
Agent Mulder

34:55.340 --> 34:58.104
they might be willing
to make a deal.

34:58.209 --> 35:01.144
It could save his life.

36:47.852 --> 36:49.649
(Click)

37:01.499 --> 37:02.864
Name?

37:06.638 --> 37:07.798
Dana Scully.

37:07.872 --> 37:09.396
Company or institution?

37:09.507 --> 37:10.599
Federal Government.

37:10.708 --> 37:11.970
Project password?

37:20.885 --> 37:23.149
Project password?

37:25.657 --> 37:28.023
Purity Control.

37:49.781 --> 37:51.612
Log in, please.

40:08.252 --> 40:10.277
You're late.

40:10.354 --> 40:11.651
Doyou have it?

40:11.723 --> 40:12.553
Yes.

40:12.623 --> 40:14.147
Good.
They're willing

40:14.225 --> 40:15.817
to make the exchange.

40:15.893 --> 40:17.485
You spoke to them?

40:17.562 --> 40:18.586
Yes.

40:18.663 --> 40:20.494
I'll take the parcel.

40:20.565 --> 40:21.623
No, sir.

40:21.699 --> 40:24.327
I'll make the exchange.

40:24.402 --> 40:25.664
I made the deal, Scully.

40:25.737 --> 40:27.261
They're expecting me.

40:27.338 --> 40:29.169
I don't trustyou.

40:29.273 --> 40:31.036
There's no one else to trust.

40:31.142 --> 40:32.769
I don't know whoyou are.

40:32.877 --> 40:34.504
I know nothing aboutyou.

40:34.612 --> 40:36.170
For God's sake

40:36.280 --> 40:38.077
don't screw this up.

40:38.149 --> 40:40.481
In 1 987, a group ofchildren
from a Southern state

40:40.551 --> 40:42.746
were given
what their parents thought

40:42.820 --> 40:44.048
was a routine inoculation.

40:44.122 --> 40:45.680
What theywere injected with

40:45.757 --> 40:47.486
was a clone DNA

40:47.558 --> 40:49.025
from the contents
ofthat package

40:49.093 --> 40:50.685
you're holding
as a test.

40:50.762 --> 40:52.821
That's the kind ofpeople
you're dealing with.

40:52.897 --> 40:54.489
So, why give it back to them?

40:54.565 --> 40:56.931
To save Mulder's life.

40:57.001 --> 40:59.128
At the risk ofother lives?

40:59.203 --> 41:03.367
You and Mulder are the ones
who can bring it to light.

41:03.474 --> 41:05.271
Now, give me
the parcel.

41:13.117 --> 41:15.585
Give me the parcel, Scully.

42:04.135 --> 42:05.932
No!

42:15.146 --> 42:16.670
Mulder. Mulder.

42:30.561 --> 42:32.153
Trust...

42:37.134 --> 42:38.965
trust...

42:40.338 --> 42:42.203
no one.

43:27.418 --> 43:28.885
(Telephone Ringing)

43:30.955 --> 43:32.980
Hello.

43:33.057 --> 43:35.423
Mulder:
Hey, Scully, it's me.

43:35.493 --> 43:37.188
Where areyou?

43:38.930 --> 43:40.693
They're shutting us down,
Scully.

43:40.765 --> 43:42.562
What?

43:42.633 --> 43:44.828
They called me in tonight

43:44.902 --> 43:46.267
and they said

43:46.337 --> 43:48.703
they're going to reassign us
to other sections.

43:48.773 --> 43:51.264
Who told you that?

43:51.342 --> 43:53.242
Skinner.

43:53.344 --> 43:55.869
He said word came down
from the top

43:55.980 --> 43:57.811
ofthe executive branch.

43:57.882 --> 43:58.871
Mulder...

43:58.983 --> 44:00.746
It's over, Scully.

44:00.818 --> 44:02.683
Lodge a protest. They can't...

44:02.753 --> 44:04.448
Yes, they can.

44:06.624 --> 44:09.320
What areyou going to do?

44:09.393 --> 44:10.917
I'm...

44:12.196 --> 44:14.164
not going to give up.

44:14.231 --> 44:15.926
I can't give up...

44:19.837 --> 44:22.271
not as long
as the truth is out there.
