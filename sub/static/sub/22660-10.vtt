13:06.187 --> 13:09.172

Rose Marquez called the police.

13:09.480 --> 13:10.731
I didn't call her.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.065

- What?

27:10.074 --> 27:11.540
Frank's phone.

27:15.717 --> 27:16.845

28:35.859 --> 28:37.825

You're here to save yourself.

You're wrong, Rose.

Wow...

29:01.382 --> 29:02.841
You are good.

29:02.878 --> 29:06.189
But Zachary told me everything.

29:06.309 --> 29:09.929
That was so cruel. Letting
me think that I was free.

Frank! I was stuck here,

Can I ask you a question?

You now when those two cops first came by

30:55.412 --> 30:57.735

You've only worked with
him a couple months, right?

31:06.184 --> 31:07.694
I don't know Frank at all.

31:07.814 --> 31:10.749
And I know him better than
anybody else I've ever met.

31:11.540 --> 31:13.952
You realize that makes
absolutely no sense whatsoever?

31:14.022 --> 31:16.630
Frank doesn't trust people.
He doesn't let anyone close.

31:16.831 --> 31:18.264
Why do you think that is?

31:18.465 --> 31:19.682
I don't know, he...

He wouldn't tell and I know not to ask.

All I know is that he will

The technology that got you here

39:12.627 --> 39:15.091
also makes it exceedingly difficult

39:15.292 --> 39:16.974
to stage a murder-suicide.

39:17.094 --> 39:19.422
Powder burns, blood spatter.

39:19.729 --> 39:21.325
Very hard to fake.

39:21.445 --> 39:23.199
What are you going to do?

39:23.400 --> 39:24.885
Oh, I'm not gonna do anything.

39:24.934 --> 39:26.486
It's what Mr. Martin's going to do.

39:29.171 --> 39:31.000
Frank would never hurt me.

39:31.293 --> 39:32.621
I know that now.

39:32.741 --> 39:34.457
Well, he already has,

39:34.577 --> 39:36.681
according to the police.
Doug made sure of that.

39:36.690 --> 39:40.137
The only thing he didn't give
the police was your dead body.

39:41.317 --> 39:43.905
It's called killing two
birds with one stone.

39:45.086 --> 39:46.721
What are you doing?

39:47.022 --> 39:48.306
This phone is in a house.

39:48.323 --> 39:49.557
It's got some tunneling protocol.

39:49.594 --> 39:51.189
In English, please.

39:51.309 --> 39:53.391
The house. I think it belongs to Schramm.

39:55.615 --> 39:57.883
You can't seriously expect me to shoot her.

39:58.886 --> 40:01.496

40:07.341 --> 40:09.711
Your associates, cohorts...

40:10.524 --> 40:12.046
Caterina and Jules.

40:12.069 --> 40:15.324
They're on their way here with
two men they believe to be RCMP.

40:16.203 --> 40:17.332
They're your men.

40:17.452 --> 40:18.568
Correct.

40:18.761 --> 40:20.891
They'll kill your associates
if you don't do what I say.

40:20.956 --> 40:22.454
But if you do...

40:23.069 --> 40:26.077
When they arrive, they'll find
your dead body on the floor

40:26.727 --> 40:28.811
and Rose's pretty corpse beside it.

40:34.511 --> 40:36.623
Two bullets in the clip, Mr. Martin.

40:37.163 --> 40:39.166

40:41.808 --> 40:43.714
- Bingo.
- Is that Schramm's house?

40:43.743 --> 40:45.967
Yup, he's got the whole place wired up.
