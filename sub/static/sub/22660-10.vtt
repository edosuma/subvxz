Zachary can't find me...

03:03.823 --> 03:05.350

03:05.944 --> 03:08.915
I never thought that I
would live to see this.

03:09.182 --> 03:11.633
You could go to the police, Miss Marquez.

03:12.386 --> 03:13.910
It's Rose, please.

03:15.484 --> 03:17.404
And no, I can't.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.710
He would kill me.

03:20.294 --> 03:21.914
They would protect you.

03:22.499 --> 03:23.496
No one can.

I have to disappear.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.636
Where will you go?

03:29.002 --> 03:30.401
Somewhere warm.

03:30.636 --> 03:32.102
Rio, maybe.

03:32.639 --> 03:34.444
Do you want to come with me?

03:36.904 --> 03:38.075
Wish I could.

Why can't I find a guy like you?

03:43.983 --> 03:45.484
What kind of guy is that?

03:46.498 --> 03:47.486
A good guy.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.458

07:49.466 --> 07:51.288

If you understood the
lengths these people went to,

07:53.344 --> 07:54.654
you would too.

08:20.685 --> 08:21.824
I've already mapped it.

08:21.870 --> 08:24.686
There are surveillance cameras
in the city, Mr. Martin.

08:24.806 --> 08:27.757
There are surveillance cameras
in every city, Mr. Gagnon.

08:27.959 --> 08:29.672
We need to plan a particular path

08:29.681 --> 08:31.475
to avoid being seen.

08:31.595 --> 08:33.312
That wasn't part of the deal.

08:33.432 --> 08:36.466
Yeah, I'm sorry Frank, but it is now, okay?

08:36.687 --> 08:39.202
I was up half the night trying
to figure this thing out.

08:42.413 --> 08:44.757
You hired me to get you
to the border. I'll do that

08:44.877 --> 08:46.777
if you let me do my job my way.

08:46.897 --> 08:48.043
No way, Frank.

08:48.544 --> 08:50.114
I need you to follow this route...

08:50.385 --> 08:51.438
precisely.

08:53.429 --> 08:55.417
That will take an extra 30 to 40 minutes.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.716
Just do it, please.

But I know what's in this case.

09:43.389 --> 09:45.799
And I know what my employers
would do to get it back!

09:45.840 --> 09:47.861

09:48.419 --> 09:50.437

We're with the RCMP.

11:07.046 --> 11:08.652
We'd just like to ask you a few questions.

11:08.671 --> 11:10.015
I already gave a statement.

11:10.135 --> 11:11.213
You gave a statement?

11:11.241 --> 11:12.448
Just a few minutes ago.

11:12.568 --> 11:13.829
What happened?

11:13.865 --> 11:15.512
A client was charged with...

11:15.520 --> 11:17.369
assault and resisting arrest.

11:17.404 --> 11:19.257
Mr. Martin, we're not sure
what your talking about.

11:19.289 --> 11:21.530
We're here to ask about Rose Marquez.

11:21.650 --> 11:22.838
Rose Marquez?

11:22.847 --> 11:24.493
You do know Ms. Marquez?

11:24.511 --> 11:25.696
Why are you asking?

11:25.718 --> 11:27.950
She disappeared from
her apartment last night

11:27.968 --> 11:29.900
at approximately 9:17 pm.

11:30.101 --> 11:32.211
Her appartment? In Toronto?

11:32.237 --> 11:35.001
She called 911, saying
a man was breaking in.

11:35.047 --> 11:37.763
When officers arrived, they found
the door forced open and blood.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.076
And why are you here?

11:39.277 --> 11:41.511
Where were you last night, Mr. Martin?

11:41.946 --> 11:44.447
Not breaking into Rose Marquez' appartment.

11:44.649 --> 11:47.248
He was with me. For the past 48 hours.

11:47.368 --> 11:50.815
Ms. Boldieu explained you're
a transporter, is that right?

11:50.854 --> 11:52.910
- That's right.
- Can you give us the name of this

11:52.923 --> 11:55.288
client who was arrested for assault?

11:55.326 --> 11:57.035
Frank, we already told
them we can't give them

11:57.062 --> 11:58.525
that information, it's confidential.

11:58.544 --> 12:01.097
It's okay, Jules, under
normal circumstances, I agree.

12:01.123 --> 12:04.040
But as he's already in custody,
his name is Charles Gagnon.

12:05.235 --> 12:07.287
Alright then, we'll speak to Mr. Gagnon,

12:07.324 --> 12:09.586
just to verify your whereabouts today.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.908
In the meantime...

12:12.028 --> 12:14.302
we advise you not to leave the country.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.750
Sergeants, I haven't seen
Rose Marquez in 9 months.

12:17.781 --> 12:19.543
Why did you think to question me?

12:20.896 --> 12:22.112
Nine months?

12:22.232 --> 12:23.419
That's right.

12:23.753 --> 12:25.734
I wouldn't say anymore without a lawyer.

12:25.854 --> 12:28.271
And you haven't seen or
spoken with her since then?

12:28.296 --> 12:31.414
I haven't seen or spoken
to Rose Marquez in 9 months.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.804
Write it down, why don't you.

12:32.832 --> 12:34.432
I don't have to write shit down!

12:34.464 --> 12:36.848
We checked Ms. Marquez' call log.

12:36.968 --> 12:38.668
It says you rang her last night

12:38.704 --> 12:40.460
just before she called the police.

12:40.580 --> 12:41.485
Hmm?

12:41.670 --> 12:43.186
I can assure you that's not possible.

12:43.607 --> 12:45.451
We assure you it is.

12:47.409 --> 12:49.994
If you have any more
questions, this is my card.

12:52.863 --> 12:54.846
We'll be in touch, Mr. Martin.

13:02.458 --> 13:04.373
I didn't want to say
it in front of them but

13:04.417 --> 13:06.160
where were you last night?

13:06.187 --> 13:09.172
Yeah, around the time that
Rose Marquez called the police.

13:09.480 --> 13:10.731
I didn't call her.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.065
And I certainly didn't break down her door.

13:14.755 --> 13:17.499
Are you sure? Because
according to this, you did.

13:17.619 --> 13:18.830
Call her, I mean.

13:18.844 --> 13:20.000
What are you talking about?

13:20.120 --> 13:21.419
Your mobile phone record.

13:21.463 --> 13:24.967
It shows an outgoing call
to Rose Marquez at 9:14 pm.

13:25.589 --> 13:27.116
It didn't happen.

13:28.215 --> 13:30.116
What about Frank's car?

13:30.317 --> 13:33.119
Does the navigation system
prove he wasn't there?

13:34.168 --> 13:36.729
Someone's gone to a lot of
trouble to make me look guilty.

13:38.191 --> 13:39.144
Shit!

13:39.459 --> 13:40.433
What?

13:41.330 --> 13:43.708
Her apartment's on Palmerston Boulevard.

13:43.745 --> 13:45.164
According to your NAV system,

13:45.366 --> 13:47.604
you stopped there at 9:17 PM.

13:49.402 --> 13:50.504
Gagnon.

13:51.016 --> 13:52.505
What about him?

13:52.773 --> 13:54.854
He programmed a new route
into this thing this morning.

13:54.885 --> 13:56.609
I let him, I figured it was harmless.

13:56.810 --> 13:58.818
Well then he's the one setting you up.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.196
Can you wipe the NAV system?

14:01.223 --> 14:03.336
- Yeah, of course.
- Then do it.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.230
Are you sure you want to do that?

14:05.257 --> 14:07.983
- That's obstruction of justice.
- Just do it.

14:19.983 --> 14:21.318
What the hell?

14:21.693 --> 14:22.937
What is it?

14:23.687 --> 14:25.096
Someone's got major skills, that's what.

14:25.123 --> 14:26.596
I can't wipe the system.

14:33.478 --> 14:34.937
Are you sure?

14:38.294 --> 14:39.465
Okay.

14:39.751 --> 14:41.147
I'll tell him.

14:43.846 --> 14:45.805
It's your friend, Sgt. Farrelly.

14:45.925 --> 14:48.135
He says there's no such person

14:48.162 --> 14:50.230
as Charles Gagnon getting
arrested this morning.

14:50.513 --> 14:52.114
That can't be. I saw it.

14:52.992 --> 14:54.794
You saw someone get arrested.

14:54.799 --> 14:57.949
But the RCMP says there's no
such person as Charles Gagnon.

14:57.970 --> 15:00.602
No way, okay? I vetted this guy
every which way and backwards

15:02.440 --> 15:03.749

15:12.516 --> 15:14.112
Come on.

15:18.121 --> 15:19.572
Son-of-a-bitch.

15:20.341 --> 15:22.086
Frank, I swear to God that

15:22.093 --> 15:24.508
he was all over the net
and now he's gone, a ghost.

15:24.628 --> 15:26.843
Well, I saw someone get arrested.

15:28.023 --> 15:29.669
Yeah...

15:30.167 --> 15:32.368
Somebody with extraordinary hacking skills.

15:32.488 --> 15:33.804
Whoever this guy is,

15:33.813 --> 15:36.620
he can fabricate and
wipe whatever he wants...

15:37.078 --> 15:38.917
including arrest records.

15:39.558 --> 15:41.414
That's the question then, isn't it?

15:41.600 --> 15:42.901
Who was I driving around?

15:43.301 --> 15:44.634
Come on.

15:56.460 --> 15:57.782
So where we going?

15:57.983 --> 15:59.762
The apartment where I picked him up.

15:59.789 --> 16:01.271
You don't think he'd go back there?

16:01.391 --> 16:02.253
No.

16:02.373 --> 16:04.307
But at least it's a real physical place.

16:07.069 --> 16:08.203
I...

16:08.594 --> 16:10.294
Frank, is there...

16:10.691 --> 16:12.438
Is there anything about this Rose Marquez

16:12.483 --> 16:14.011
that you haven't told us?

16:14.615 --> 16:16.066
She was a client...

16:16.501 --> 16:18.802
trying to escape an abusive boyfriend.

16:19.316 --> 16:21.420
And you helped her escape from him, right?

16:21.456 --> 16:22.993
The last time I saw her,

16:23.008 --> 16:24.804
she was boarding a private jet in Toronto,

16:24.842 --> 16:26.377
bound for Brazil.

16:26.411 --> 16:27.969
Who was her boyfriend?

Schramm...

16:30.139 --> 16:31.319
Zachary Schramm.

16:31.343 --> 16:33.340

16:33.702 --> 16:37.044
CEO of ZS Trust, largest
tech company in Canada?

16:37.086 --> 16:39.108
He was obsessed with Rose,

16:39.228 --> 16:41.028
wouldn't let her out of his sight.

16:41.148 --> 16:43.084
Why didn't she just call the police?

16:43.204 --> 16:44.898
She said she couldn't.

16:45.693 --> 16:47.331
She said that he'd kill her.

16:50.024 --> 16:51.236
What?

16:53.943 --> 16:55.599
Our friends are back.

17:01.303 --> 17:02.386
What do we do now?

17:02.670 --> 17:03.658
We lose them.

17:03.671 --> 17:04.704
Cool.

17:04.906 --> 17:06.539
Under the circumstances,

17:06.566 --> 17:09.108
I'd advise you not to

It could set off a bomb or something.

19:04.789 --> 19:06.491
I don't think he's gone to all this trouble

19:06.524 --> 19:08.329

<i>Is she dead?</i>

22:14.573 --> 22:16.488
Actually she was scared of you.

That's why she hired
Frank in the first place.

- What?

27:10.074 --> 27:11.540
Frank's phone.

You're here to save yourself.

Wow...

You are good.

29:02.878 --> 29:06.189
But Zachary told me everything.

29:06.309 --> 29:09.929
That was so cruel. Letting
me think that I was free.

You now when those two cops first came by

him a couple months, right?

31:06.184 --> 31:07.694
I don't know Frank at all.

31:07.814 --> 31:10.749
And I know him better than
anybody else I've ever met.

31:11.540 --> 31:13.952
You realize that makes
absolutely no sense whatsoever?

31:14.022 --> 31:16.630
Frank doesn't trust people.
He doesn't let anyone close.

Why do you think that is?

31:18.465 --> 31:19.682

He wouldn't tell and I know not to ask.

All I know is that he will

also makes it exceedingly difficult

39:15.292 --> 39:16.974
to stage a murder-suicide.

39:17.094 --> 39:19.422
Powder burns, blood spatter.

39:19.729 --> 39:21.325
Very hard to fake.

39:21.445 --> 39:23.199
What are you going to do?

39:23.400 --> 39:24.885
Oh, I'm not gonna do anything.

39:24.934 --> 39:26.486
It's what Mr. Martin's going to do.

39:29.171 --> 39:31.000
Frank would never hurt me.

39:31.293 --> 39:32.621
I know that now.

39:32.741 --> 39:34.457
Well, he already has,

39:34.577 --> 39:36.681
according to the police.
Doug made sure of that.

39:36.690 --> 39:40.137
The only thing he didn't give
the police was your dead body.

39:41.317 --> 39:43.905
It's called killing two
birds with one stone.

39:45.086 --> 39:46.721
What are you doing?

39:47.022 --> 39:48.306
This phone is in a house.

39:48.323 --> 39:49.557
It's got some tunneling protocol.

39:49.594 --> 39:51.189
In English, please.

39:51.309 --> 39:53.391
The house. I think it belongs to Schramm.

39:55.615 --> 39:57.883
You can't seriously expect me to shoot her.

39:58.886 --> 40:01.496
I seriously expect you to do just that.

40:01.498 --> 40:02.803
You're going to kill us anyway.

40:02.837 --> 40:04.419
Why would I make it easy for you?

40:05.138 --> 40:07.006
What are the names of your two friends?

40:07.341 --> 40:09.711
Your associates, cohorts...

40:10.524 --> 40:12.046
Caterina and Jules.

40:12.069 --> 40:15.324
They're on their way here with
two men they believe to be RCMP.

40:16.203 --> 40:17.332
They're your men.

40:17.452 --> 40:18.568
Correct.

40:18.761 --> 40:20.891
They'll kill your associates
if you don't do what I say.

40:20.956 --> 40:22.454
But if you do...

40:23.069 --> 40:26.077
When they arrive, they'll find
your dead body on the floor

40:26.727 --> 40:28.811
and Rose's pretty corpse beside it.

40:34.511 --> 40:36.623
Two bullets in the clip, Mr. Martin.

40:37.163 --> 40:39.166
Make 'em count.

40:41.808 --> 40:43.714
- Bingo.
- Is that Schramm's house?

40:43.743 --> 40:45.967
Yup, he's got the whole place wired up.

40:46.245 --> 40:47.906
There. It's Frank.

40:48.026 --> 40:49.128
Oh shit!

40:49.248 --> 40:51.192
This is not good.

40:53.419 --> 40:56.188
<i>â™ª [Suspenseful music
with hard beat comes up]</i>

41:10.302 --> 41:12.288
- You've got to stop this!
- How?

41:12.325 --> 41:14.337
I don't know, just do something!

41:20.112 --> 41:21.521
I'm sorry, Rose.

41:22.213 --> 41:23.025
No...

41:24.653 --> 41:25.900
I'm sorry, Frank.

41:27.252 --> 41:28.703
For everything.

<i>â™ª [Music rises to dramatic crescendo]</i>

Is he... ?

42:32.784 --> 42:33.873
No...

42:33.873 --> 42:35.437
Just unconscious.

42:36.886 --> 42:38.554
Frank...

42:38.808 --> 42:41.190
I feel like such a fool
for mistrusting you.

42:41.424 --> 42:43.089
You've saved my life.

42:43.209 --> 42:44.393
Not yet I haven't.

42:45.261 --> 42:46.962
See if you can find some gaffer tape?

42:47.430 --> 42:48.833
What are you gonna do?

42:49.097 --> 42:50.443
Finish this.

42:54.586 --> 42:56.049
Shit!

42:58.074 --> 43:00.138
That's him. That's Gagnon.

<i>[Sound of cautious steps on stairway]</i>

43:13.540 --> 43:14.985
Oh God, no!

43:16.190 --> 43:17.610
Frank!

43:21.696 --> 43:23.949
- It can't be.
- But it is.

43:24.332 --> 43:26.564
We were too late.

43:30.138 --> 43:33.641
<i>[Sound of Frank delivering
hard blows to fake policemen]</i>

43:35.444 --> 43:36.670
Shit!

43:41.728 --> 43:42.798
Lady...

43:44.352 --> 43:47.024
Awake from that sleep of death.

43:48.889 --> 43:50.390
Are you okay?

43:50.417 --> 43:52.859
Reports of my demise
were greatly exaggerated.

43:53.453 --> 43:54.509
And mine.

43:54.629 --> 43:55.950
I still don't get it.

43:55.963 --> 43:57.697
Why did you just assault those cops?

43:58.098 --> 44:01.116
- They weren't cops.
- They were working for Schramm.

44:01.637 --> 44:02.790
Right.

44:02.836 --> 44:05.370
Let's call the real ones, shall we?

44:06.606 --> 44:09.341
<i>â™ª [Eerie music comes up]</i>

44:28.567 --> 44:31.329
Think you can get me onto
another plane to Rio, Frank?

44:31.530 --> 44:33.030
For real this time?

44:33.277 --> 44:35.143
That won't be necessary.

44:35.902 --> 44:38.034
Zachary isn't dead.

44:38.270 --> 44:39.824
Whatever they charge him with,

44:39.839 --> 44:41.471
he'll still beat it and come after me.

44:41.507 --> 44:43.641
I don't think so. Not this time.

44:44.536 --> 44:47.792
I recovered this footage
from Schramm's CCTV.

44:55.766 --> 44:57.422
Dead to rights.

44:58.023 --> 45:00.191
He's not getting out of this one.

45:00.759 --> 45:02.626
Let's take that to the police.

45:16.635 --> 45:18.528
Are you sure?

Trust me.
