WEBVTT

00:13.999 --> 00:14.999
- Previously on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:14.999 --> 00:15.999
- You think
Lisa's seriously

00:16.000 --> 00:17.999
gonna hire the girl
you're dating?

00:17.999 --> 00:18.999
- Yeah, 100%.

00:18.999 --> 00:20.999
- Nice to meet you.
I'm Brittany.

00:20.999 --> 00:21.999
- Have you got a résumé?

00:21.999 --> 00:23.999
- I do not have a résumé
with me, no.

00:24.999 --> 00:27.999
- You are the most beautiful
girl I've ever laid eyes on.

00:29.999 --> 00:30.999
We didn't have sex,
Kristen.

00:30.999 --> 00:31.999
- You swear to God?

00:32.000 --> 00:33.999
- I know that
100% on my life.

00:33.999 --> 00:36.999
I'm 100% sure
I made out with her.

00:36.999 --> 00:39.999
- Shay got drunk
out with his friends

00:39.999 --> 00:42.999
and he hasn't
been home since.

00:42.999 --> 00:43.999
- Shay's been like,
drinking a lot.

00:43.999 --> 00:45.999
I'd like to talk to him

00:45.999 --> 00:46.999
and see what's going on,
you know?

00:46.999 --> 00:48.999
- The mixing of pills
with alcohol

00:48.999 --> 00:49.999
is just a double depressant.

00:49.999 --> 00:51.999
He was taking five a day

00:51.999 --> 00:52.999
and I had
absolutely no idea.

00:52.999 --> 00:53.999
- Five a day?

00:53.999 --> 00:56.999
- I feel like
I've been cheated on.

00:56.999 --> 00:59.999
- Is he the man that
you thought he was?

01:03.999 --> 01:05.999
- ♪ You know ♪

01:05.999 --> 01:07.999
♪ That it's our time ♪

01:07.999 --> 01:09.999
♪ These are the best days ♪

01:09.999 --> 01:12.999
♪ Of our lives ♪

01:12.999 --> 01:16.999
♪ Just raise
your glasses high ♪

01:16.999 --> 01:20.999
♪ This one's for you tonight ♪

01:22.999 --> 01:26.999
- ♪ If it's the last time
then we are living it up ♪

01:26.999 --> 01:30.999
♪ Oh, this is our time ♪

01:30.999 --> 01:31.999
- I brought a bunch of like,

01:31.999 --> 01:33.999
dresses and like,
solid color things.

01:33.999 --> 01:34.999
I just want it to be, like,

01:34.999 --> 01:36.999
mostly about the hair
and the accessory, you know?

01:37.000 --> 01:39.999
Really simple hairstyles

01:39.999 --> 01:41.999
that anyone can do, obviously,

01:41.999 --> 01:43.999
but using stuff like bobby pins,

01:43.999 --> 01:44.999
not just to pin your hair back

01:44.999 --> 01:45.999
but like, creating like,

01:45.999 --> 01:46.999
little designs
throughout your hair.

01:46.999 --> 01:50.999
The head chains are kind of
a cool way to accessorize too.

01:50.999 --> 01:51.999
I know like, a lot of people
wear them for like,

01:51.999 --> 01:52.999
festivals and stuff,
but they're totally good

01:52.999 --> 01:53.999
for a night out.
- Yeah.

01:53.999 --> 01:56.999
- "Pucker & Pout" is a blog

01:56.999 --> 01:58.999
that I started
about a year and a half ago,

01:58.999 --> 02:03.999
that really focuses on beauty,
hair, tutorials, D.I.Y.

02:03.999 --> 02:04.999
Do what I've been doing
every day,

02:04.999 --> 02:06.999
but share it with the world.

02:06.999 --> 02:10.999
- Any like, non-smiling,
looking away--

02:10.999 --> 02:12.999
it's all about the hair

02:12.999 --> 02:13.999
and less about
the expression on my face

02:13.999 --> 02:14.999
would be great,
'cause I'm not, like,

02:15.000 --> 02:17.999
in the chipperest mood today
to take photos, so...

02:17.999 --> 02:20.999
Shay and I have never
gone more than

02:20.999 --> 02:23.999
a few hours without
exchanging a text message

02:23.999 --> 02:24.999
or FaceTime
or a phone call.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.999
The fact that
it's now been several days

02:27.999 --> 02:30.999
is just weighing
so heavy on my heart.

02:33.999 --> 02:35.999
Should we have Gordo
model with us today?

02:35.999 --> 02:38.999
- Hey, I don't wanna toot
my own horn, but, uh,

02:38.999 --> 02:39.999
you guys know I did graduate

02:39.999 --> 02:40.999
from the Tom Sandoval
School of Modeling,

02:40.999 --> 02:42.999
so, like, if you need
a few pointers,

02:42.999 --> 02:45.000
I could lend my expertise.

02:45.999 --> 02:46.999
- How was work last night?

02:46.999 --> 02:47.999
- I left early.

02:47.999 --> 02:49.999
- Oh.

02:49.999 --> 02:51.999
- A fun little sit-down
with Lisa.

02:51.999 --> 02:53.999
I'm telling her
all the amazing things

02:53.999 --> 02:55.999
going on in my life right now.

02:55.999 --> 02:57.999
- What did you say?

02:57.999 --> 02:58.999
- He had had

02:58.999 --> 03:00.999
a pill problem last year,
and I thought

03:00.999 --> 03:03.999
right when we got
that under control

03:03.999 --> 03:04.999
then his drinking gets worse.

03:04.999 --> 03:06.999
- I just found out
about all this sh**.

03:06.999 --> 03:07.999
So this is all new to me.

03:07.999 --> 03:08.999
You sort of have
this, like, idea,

03:08.999 --> 03:10.999
this stereotype
of what an addict

03:10.999 --> 03:11.999
should look like, you know?

03:11.999 --> 03:14.999
And then you see
someone like Shay,

03:14.999 --> 03:16.999
who is happy-go-lucky,
he's loveable,

03:16.999 --> 03:21.999
and, you know,
it's just shocking.

03:21.999 --> 03:22.999
Yeah.

03:22.999 --> 03:23.999
I feel like I should
reach out to him.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.999
- I really don't wanna cry off
all this makeup I just put on.

03:32.999 --> 03:35.999
- Breathe, breathe, breathe.

03:35.999 --> 03:36.999
You look really good,

03:36.999 --> 03:38.999
and I need to take pictures
of your gorgeous face.

03:38.999 --> 03:40.999
- Lisa told me
to breathe through my nose.

03:40.999 --> 03:44.999
- Yes, just breathe and
it's like, one day at a time.

03:44.999 --> 03:45.999
Honestly.

03:48.999 --> 03:49.999
Scheana, this is Jennifer.

03:49.999 --> 03:50.999
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

03:50.999 --> 03:52.999
- Hi.

03:56.999 --> 03:58.999
- You look like a goddess
right now.

03:58.999 --> 03:59.999
- Thanks.

03:59.999 --> 04:01.999
I wish I felt like one.

04:01.999 --> 04:03.999
I really wanna be here
for Katie.

04:03.999 --> 04:06.999
I wanna make, you know,
these pictures look amazing.

04:06.999 --> 04:09.999
- So "Game of Thrones"
inspired. I love it.

04:10.999 --> 04:11.999
- But all I can
think about right now

04:11.999 --> 04:13.999
is my marriage is falling apart.

04:13.999 --> 04:15.999
How can I smile?

04:19.999 --> 04:20.999
- I think it's good.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.999
- Wanna wrap?
- Mm-hmm.

04:22.999 --> 04:25.999
- Sorry I'm not in my normal
perky, peppy mood.

04:43.999 --> 04:44.999
- Hey.
- What's up?

04:44.999 --> 04:46.999
- What's going on, kiddo?
- Working.

04:46.999 --> 04:49.999
- How you liking
this place so far?

04:49.999 --> 04:50.999
- It's a tough crowd over here.

04:50.999 --> 04:51.999
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:51.999 --> 04:52.999
- Lala, she's young,

04:52.999 --> 04:54.999
she's blonde, she's pretty.

04:54.999 --> 04:56.999
She's hard not to look at,
really.

04:56.999 --> 05:01.000
Any, uh, males
in the, uh, equation?

05:01.999 --> 05:02.000
- Like?

05:02.999 --> 05:03.999
- Are you dating?
- No.

05:03.999 --> 05:04.999
- No?
- Uh-uh.

05:04.999 --> 05:05.999
- I got--I got Brittany,
you know?

05:05.999 --> 05:07.999
But we're not married yet,
you know?

05:07.999 --> 05:08.999
I still got a little bit
of feelers out there.

05:08.999 --> 05:10.999
I gotta see what's biting.

05:10.999 --> 05:12.999
And you're Mormon, right?

05:12.999 --> 05:13.999
Is that--
someone tell me that?

05:13.999 --> 05:15.999
Or you come from an area
of lots of Mormons?

05:15.999 --> 05:17.999
- No.
Yeah, well, I'm from Utah.

05:17.999 --> 05:19.999
- I heard this little rumor
about Mormons, not to--

05:19.999 --> 05:21.999
if this is inappropriate
I'm sorry,

05:21.999 --> 05:22.999
but a lot of girls,

05:22.999 --> 05:23.999
they--they don't have sex
before marriage.

05:23.999 --> 05:24.999
- Right.

05:24.999 --> 05:25.999
- Or they try to save themselves

05:25.999 --> 05:28.999
so they're really into...anal.

05:30.999 --> 05:31.999
Is that true?

05:31.999 --> 05:33.999
- Yeah.
- Are you serious?

05:33.999 --> 05:34.999
- Anal and they give
killer blowjobs.

05:35.999 --> 05:37.999
- Mormons are champs, man.

05:37.999 --> 05:39.999
That's why I'm not a Mormon.

05:39.999 --> 05:43.999
I do not want to have anal
or give multiple BJs a day.

05:43.999 --> 05:46.999
It's a lot of work!

05:46.999 --> 05:48.999
- I need to move
to f***ing Utah.

05:48.999 --> 05:50.999
- No, don't be doing that.
- I'm just kidding.

05:50.999 --> 05:51.999
I'm sorry.
- I'll be your Utah chick.

05:51.999 --> 05:52.999
- Well, that's interesting.

05:52.999 --> 05:54.999
Do you know the things
that I get into?

05:56.999 --> 05:57.999
- Okay, what are you doing?

05:57.999 --> 05:58.999
What are you actually
doing here?

05:58.999 --> 06:00.999
- I'm--I'm making sure
she's doing all right.

06:00.999 --> 06:02.999
She's just started.
- Are you working tonight?

06:02.999 --> 06:04.999
- I'm working right now
and tonight, yes.

06:04.999 --> 06:06.999
- So get back behind the bar.
- I'll talk to you later.

06:06.999 --> 06:10.999
- And ignore 90% of
what he says.

06:10.999 --> 06:14.000
Actually, no, I'm wrong.
95%.

06:17.999 --> 06:19.000
What are you doing?

06:19.999 --> 06:21.999
What are you doing
flirting with Lala?

06:21.999 --> 06:23.999
- Every girl needs a little Jax
in her life.

06:23.999 --> 06:25.999
- I'm sure there's
a little Jax to give her.

06:26.999 --> 06:29.999
- Out of all the girls
in Hollywood,

06:29.999 --> 06:32.999
he has to choose my new hostess.

06:32.999 --> 06:34.999
Don't poo in your own backyard.

06:34.999 --> 06:36.999
You're here to work.
Do that on your own time.

06:36.999 --> 06:40.999
Aren't you in love
with Ms. Lingerie?

06:40.999 --> 06:41.999
- Brittany.

06:41.999 --> 06:42.999
- Do you think Lisa
will like me?

06:42.999 --> 06:44.999
- Yeah, I really do.

06:44.999 --> 06:46.999
I really think she liked you.
She was really impressed.

06:46.999 --> 06:48.999
- Okay, good.

06:48.999 --> 06:49.999
- Yeah, she's coming in town.
And I really--

06:49.999 --> 06:51.999
- She's coming back?

06:51.999 --> 06:52.999
- Yeah, she's coming back
tomorrow.

06:52.999 --> 06:55.999
That being said,
she really needs a job.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.999
She's a really hard worker,
she's a great bartender,

06:57.999 --> 06:58.999
she's a good girl.
- We've been through this.

06:58.999 --> 07:00.999
She hasn't even been through

07:00.999 --> 07:01.999
your 90-day trial period.

07:01.999 --> 07:03.999
How do I know she's gonna
last with you?

07:03.999 --> 07:05.999
Let's be honest, right?

07:05.999 --> 07:09.999
This girl is gonna give up
her life and move to LA.

07:09.999 --> 07:14.999
And it's all going to depend
on Mr. Jax Taylor.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.999
You know, he's had
three noses in one year.

07:16.999 --> 07:19.999
Jax doesn't understand
the word commitment.

07:19.999 --> 07:20.999
- She just needs something,

07:20.999 --> 07:21.999
and I'm just trying to help her
to get something.

07:21.999 --> 07:23.999
It's hard--it's hard
to get a job here.

07:23.999 --> 07:24.999
- I actually do really like her.

07:24.999 --> 07:26.999
- Right.
- I think she's a nice girl.

07:26.999 --> 07:28.999
So, let's see.
- Okay.

07:28.999 --> 07:30.999
- Okay.
Now can you get me a drink?

07:30.999 --> 07:31.999
- Yeah.
What do you want to drink?

07:31.999 --> 07:34.999
- A good bartender
would remember.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.999
- Uh-oh.

07:48.999 --> 07:49.999
- What's up, guys?

07:49.999 --> 07:50.999
- Trouble.

07:50.999 --> 07:51.999
- As much as I hate him

07:51.999 --> 07:52.999
and I wanted to kill him,

07:53.000 --> 07:54.999
bringing James out actually

07:54.999 --> 07:55.999
isn't really all that bad,

07:55.999 --> 07:57.999
because he's always
gonna do something crazy.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.000
Are we gonna be good tonight?
- No.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.999
- No, all right.
- f*** that, mate.

08:00.999 --> 08:01.999
- I didn't think so.
- Don't be boring.

08:01.999 --> 08:02.999
Turning it up, mate.

08:02.999 --> 08:04.999
- He is me at that age,
you know?

08:04.999 --> 08:08.999
I was very free,
sleeping with everybody,

08:08.999 --> 08:09.999
drinking all the time...

08:09.999 --> 08:13.999
Uh, that's me recently.

08:15.999 --> 08:17.999
- Hey, man.
- What's up?

08:21.999 --> 08:23.999
- What can I get for you?
You need a drink?

08:23.999 --> 08:25.999
- Yeah, we're gonna do
tequila shots.

08:25.999 --> 08:26.999
He's gonna get his beer.

08:26.999 --> 08:28.999
- That's how we do in Florida.

08:28.999 --> 08:29.999
- Let me ask--
can I ask you one thing?

08:29.999 --> 08:31.999
What does Kristen think about
you being here right now?

08:31.999 --> 08:34.999
She's okay, no worries,
everything's good?

08:34.999 --> 08:35.999
Yeah.

08:35.999 --> 08:38.999
- Why wouldn't she be?
- Your voice went way up!

08:38.999 --> 08:39.999
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whoo-hoo!

08:39.999 --> 08:42.999
- All right, all right,
let's be honest.

08:42.999 --> 08:45.999
- Yeah, I mean, maybe she feels
a little bit uncomfortable.

08:45.999 --> 08:47.999
- You guys have broken up
and gotten back together a lot.

08:47.999 --> 08:49.999
- Oh, yeah, like 20 times
this month, I think.

08:49.999 --> 08:52.999
- Oh, my God!
20 times is--

08:52.999 --> 08:53.999
- That's a lot.

08:53.999 --> 08:55.999
- I know!

08:55.999 --> 08:57.999
Things have just come to a point
where Kristen and I are honestly

08:57.999 --> 08:59.000
just bringing out the worst
in each other.

08:59.999 --> 09:01.999
We just fight and fight
and fight

09:01.999 --> 09:02.999
and fight and fight

09:02.999 --> 09:04.999
until we find something new
to fight about.

09:04.999 --> 09:07.999
We're actually gonna start
therapy tomorrow.

09:07.999 --> 09:09.999
- It's kind of
a young relationship

09:09.999 --> 09:11.999
to be going
to therapy, right?

09:11.999 --> 09:13.999
- It's really just to better
our communication.

09:13.999 --> 09:15.999
- Like a referee?

09:17.999 --> 09:18.999
I was with Kristen for years.

09:18.999 --> 09:22.999
I'm very well aware
how crazy and delusional she is.

09:22.999 --> 09:26.999
That therapist is gonna need
a therapist when they're done.

09:26.999 --> 09:28.999
By the way,
me and you

09:28.999 --> 09:30.999
are gonna head over
to Lisa's house

09:30.999 --> 09:32.999
to talk about doing some work
for her sangria line.

09:32.999 --> 09:35.999
Obviously, you know,
her sangria's doing well.

09:35.999 --> 09:37.999
And I would like to just
go out there and like,

09:37.999 --> 09:39.999
place it with different bars,
different restaurants, whatever.

09:39.999 --> 09:41.999
- Dude, that's f***ing awesome.

09:41.999 --> 09:42.999
- Yeah, dude.
Oh, yeah.

09:42.999 --> 09:43.999
- Cool, cool.

09:43.999 --> 09:45.999
- As much as I love
doing print jobs,

09:45.999 --> 09:46.999
I feel like I'm starting
to grow out of it

09:46.999 --> 09:49.999
just a little bit,
and you know, that means

09:49.999 --> 09:53.999
I'm at a point where we realize
even Peter Pan grows up.

09:53.999 --> 09:57.999
So, let's start looking at
some other career possibilities.

09:57.999 --> 10:00.999
Obviously I know a lot
about the bar business

10:00.999 --> 10:01.999
being in it
for so many years.

10:01.999 --> 10:02.999
- Yeah.
- I've never really had

10:02.999 --> 10:04.999
an actual sales job,

10:04.999 --> 10:07.999
but I f***ing sell every single
one of those cocktails at Sur.

10:07.999 --> 10:08.999
And I sell them well.

10:10.999 --> 10:11.999
- Whoo! Four shots.

10:11.999 --> 10:14.999
- I'm sorry,
I'm getting drunk a little bit.

10:14.999 --> 10:15.999
- Me too.
I'm f***ing drunk.

10:15.999 --> 10:16.999
Cheers, mate.
- Uh-oh.

10:16.999 --> 10:18.999
- What do you guys
think of Lala?

10:18.999 --> 10:20.999
- Lala's like that
pretty hot girl

10:20.999 --> 10:22.999
that wants to be a slut,
but won't admit she's a slut,

10:22.999 --> 10:24.999
but really she's a huge slut.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.999
- James is obviously sh**faced.

10:26.999 --> 10:28.999
- I'm--I'm a little
tipsy, guys.

10:28.999 --> 10:29.999
- 'Cause his face turns red.

10:29.999 --> 10:31.999
His arms are flailing around.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.999
He also dominates
every conversation.

10:34.999 --> 10:36.999
- I was at Sur the other day
and I was like--

10:36.999 --> 10:39.999
Tom, listen to this.

10:39.999 --> 10:43.999
- And your personal space
drops down to about zero.

10:43.999 --> 10:44.999
You know what I mean, brah?

10:44.999 --> 10:46.000
- Cheers!
Yeah, mate.

10:46.999 --> 10:47.999
- Whoo!

10:47.999 --> 10:49.999
- Coming up...

10:49.999 --> 10:50.999
- It's like,
zero to f***ing 4,000.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.999
I feel like
it's an excuse

10:52.999 --> 10:55.999
for acting like
a f***ing ass****.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.999
♪ After the rain ♪

11:04.999 --> 11:06.999
♪ Come on in ♪

11:06.999 --> 11:08.999
♪ Out of the pain ♪

11:08.999 --> 11:10.999

11:10.999 --> 11:13.999
♪ Be your shelter ♪

11:18.999 --> 11:21.999
- James?

11:21.999 --> 11:24.999
You gonna wake up?

11:26.999 --> 11:28.999
- Oh, God.

11:32.999 --> 11:34.999
What are you doing?

11:34.999 --> 11:36.999
- Well, I'm making breakfast.

11:36.999 --> 11:38.999
- I don't want breakfast,
Kristen.

11:38.999 --> 11:39.999
- You don't want breakfast?

11:39.999 --> 11:42.999
That's fine.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.999
So you wanna tell me
kind of, I don't know,

11:44.999 --> 11:45.999
what the f***
happened last night?

11:45.999 --> 11:48.000
Why did you get so hammered?

11:48.999 --> 11:50.999
- I don't know, Kristen,
'cause the shots kept coming.

11:50.999 --> 11:51.999
- And now how do you feel
about that?

11:51.999 --> 11:53.999
- To be honest,
I don't know, Kristen.

11:53.999 --> 11:55.999
I've got a little bit
of a hangover.

11:55.999 --> 11:57.999
What are you doing today,
Kristen?

11:57.999 --> 11:59.999
- What am I doing today?

11:59.999 --> 12:00.999
- Yeah.

12:00.999 --> 12:02.999
- Um, we have
couple's therapy.

12:02.999 --> 12:03.999
- This is Kristen's
little way of saying,

12:03.999 --> 12:05.999
"Hey, James, don't go
having any fun today

12:05.999 --> 12:07.999
'cause there's a big sh** storm
coming your way."

12:07.999 --> 12:10.999
I've honestly been awake
for 38 seconds,

12:10.999 --> 12:12.999
and this is already
the worst day of my life.

12:16.999 --> 12:17.999
Hello.

12:17.999 --> 12:18.999
- Hi, James.

12:18.999 --> 12:19.999
- Nice to meet you.

12:19.999 --> 12:20.999
- Nice to meet you.

12:20.999 --> 12:21.999
Good to meet you.

12:21.999 --> 12:23.999
- I've been going to therapy

12:23.999 --> 12:26.999
on my own for about nine months,

12:26.999 --> 12:29.999
and it has done volumes for me.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.999
- Deep breath.

12:31.999 --> 12:32.999
Here we are.

12:32.999 --> 12:33.999
- I'm pretty upset with him
right now.

12:33.999 --> 12:35.999
- What are you upset about,
Kristen?

12:35.999 --> 12:37.999
- I'm really uncomfortable
because you're still tipsy.

12:37.999 --> 12:38.999
- Get over it, Kristen.

12:38.999 --> 12:39.999
I went out with the boys
and I got f***ing drunk.

12:39.999 --> 12:41.999
Okay, get over it.
What's the issue?

12:41.999 --> 12:42.999
It's not like
I'm a f***ing loser...

12:42.999 --> 12:44.999
- What is the issue?
- That's sitting in a den

12:44.999 --> 12:45.999
getting drunk every night
and f***ing up.

12:45.999 --> 12:46.999
You drink
a bottle of wine

12:47.000 --> 12:48.999
a day, okay?

12:48.999 --> 12:49.999
- Certainly.
- Yeah, great.

12:49.999 --> 12:51.999
- But every time
he gets hammered,

12:51.999 --> 12:54.999
it's like,
zero to f***ing 4,000.

12:54.999 --> 12:56.999
I feel like it's an excuse,

12:56.999 --> 13:00.999
um, for acting like
a f***ing ass****.

13:03.999 --> 13:06.999
Like, if I did half the sh**
that you do to me,

13:06.999 --> 13:10.999
you would, like--
your head would explode.

13:10.999 --> 13:14.999
You f***ing cheat on me
with your sorry dick.

13:14.999 --> 13:17.999
Jenna and I have been friends
for a really long time.

13:17.999 --> 13:19.999
Were friends, let's say.

13:19.999 --> 13:21.999
- Kristen, everybody gets
a knife and we just carve.

13:21.999 --> 13:22.999
- You really wanna
give me a knife?

13:22.999 --> 13:25.999
And when I started
dating James,

13:25.999 --> 13:27.999
apparently Jenna
had a thing for him,

13:27.999 --> 13:29.999
and James cheated on me
with her.

13:29.999 --> 13:31.999
- It sounds like there's
some unhealthy things happening.

13:35.999 --> 13:37.999
And for me, it's like,
how do we stop the retaliating

13:37.999 --> 13:38.999
on both of your sides?

13:38.999 --> 13:39.999
I mean, it's gonna destroy

13:39.999 --> 13:40.999
the relationship,
and if you don't

13:40.999 --> 13:43.999
want to do that,
you guys have to stop.

13:43.999 --> 13:45.000
- I guess.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.999
I just feel like
she's hurt me so much

13:46.999 --> 13:49.999
that I wanna hurt her back
when we're fighting, you know?

13:49.999 --> 13:51.999
I feel like, uh,
there's a lot of things

13:51.999 --> 13:53.999
that I haven't
quite gotten over.

13:53.999 --> 13:54.999
- Like?

13:54.999 --> 13:56.999
- So, just, like,
people she's had sex with.

13:56.999 --> 13:57.999
- Be specific.
Be specific. Who?

13:57.999 --> 13:59.999
- Jax, Tom, uh...

13:59.999 --> 14:02.999
- Tom and Jax both
affect you a lot.

14:02.999 --> 14:03.999
- It's just--I don't know.

14:03.999 --> 14:04.999
It's just uncomfortable.

14:04.999 --> 14:06.999
It's just like--you know?

14:06.999 --> 14:08.999
It makes me feel
uncomfortable.

14:08.999 --> 14:10.000
- I literally put effort
into telling you

14:10.999 --> 14:12.999
how proud I am of you,
how talented you are,

14:12.999 --> 14:15.999
how gorgeous you are,
how smart you are.

14:15.999 --> 14:16.999
- She seems to think--she's,
like, parenting me sometimes

14:16.999 --> 14:18.999
and, like, has to be, like,
worried about me

14:18.999 --> 14:19.999
and take care of me.
All that crap.

14:19.999 --> 14:21.000
I don't feel like
that's necessary.

14:21.999 --> 14:24.999
- But my biggest issue
is, like,

14:24.999 --> 14:26.999
the lack of responsibility

14:26.999 --> 14:28.999
for anything
that he does.

14:28.999 --> 14:31.999
- Where do you pull this sh**
out of your ass?

14:31.999 --> 14:32.999
I'm sorry.
- All right.

14:32.999 --> 14:34.999
- You're delusional,
that's why.

14:34.999 --> 14:35.999
- That's--again,
it's name-calling.

14:35.999 --> 14:37.999
we don't need to--there's a way
to say, like, I feel like--

14:37.999 --> 14:39.999
- I feel like
you're delusional.

14:39.999 --> 14:41.999
- Or "I feel like you
mischaracterize me."

14:41.999 --> 14:43.999
- Yeah, you completely
mischaracterize me, completely.

14:43.999 --> 14:45.999
That's f***ed up
in the head, Kristen.

14:45.999 --> 14:47.999
It's f***ed up.

14:47.999 --> 14:49.999
It's like, you f***ing bitch,
like, why would you do that?

14:49.999 --> 14:52.999
- But that language
is not respectful, you know?

14:52.999 --> 14:53.999
- Well, she's not respectful.

14:53.999 --> 14:55.999
- But that language
isn't respectful.

14:55.999 --> 14:58.999
The question is, are you guys
willing to work this stuff out?

14:58.999 --> 14:59.999
Or do you just
want to keep

14:59.999 --> 15:00.999
hurting each other
and being angry?

15:00.999 --> 15:01.999
- I'm trying so--
- I want to work it out.

15:01.999 --> 15:02.999
- I feel like
I'm trying so hard.

15:02.999 --> 15:04.999
- Then we need to figure out,

15:04.999 --> 15:05.999
like, how you guys can actually

15:05.999 --> 15:06.999
repair the things
that happened--

15:06.999 --> 15:08.999
- I guess what I'm questioning,
and I hate saying this,

15:08.999 --> 15:11.999
but I'm questioning
if that's even possible.

15:11.999 --> 15:14.999
What we're doing right now
isn't working.

15:14.999 --> 15:16.999
The growth that
I want to see in James

15:16.999 --> 15:19.999
is not coming fast enough.

15:19.999 --> 15:21.999
- This is obviously
not helping at all.

15:22.999 --> 15:23.999
God.

15:37.999 --> 15:39.999
- Hey!

15:39.999 --> 15:41.999
- How are you?
You guys look amazing.

15:41.999 --> 15:43.999
Trying to upstage us
or what's up?

15:43.999 --> 15:45.999
- Always, I'm always
trying to upstage you.

15:45.999 --> 15:46.999
- Good evening, everyone.

15:46.999 --> 15:47.999
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:47.999 --> 15:49.999
- My name's Gary.
I'll be taking care of you.

15:49.999 --> 15:50.999
- Hey, Gary, how are you?

15:50.999 --> 15:52.999
- Start you off
with a little beverage?

15:52.999 --> 15:54.999
- What you want, bubbe?
- I'm gonna have a bramble.

15:54.999 --> 15:56.999
- I'm gonna do
what you're doing.

15:56.999 --> 15:57.999
- Excellent choice, beautiful.
It'll be right up.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.999
- Everybody--we got appies?

15:59.999 --> 16:00.999
We're good on appies?

16:00.999 --> 16:01.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah, appies, drinks.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.999
- Now that I heard that
you guys are, like, officially

16:04.999 --> 16:05.999
boyfriend/girlfriend,
congratulations,

16:05.999 --> 16:06.999
by the way.
- Oh!

16:06.999 --> 16:08.000
- I've been dating Sarah

16:08.000 --> 16:09.999
since Scheana's birthday party.

16:09.999 --> 16:10.999
- This is Sarah.

16:10.999 --> 16:12.999
- Hi, Sarah. Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

16:12.999 --> 16:14.999
- It's actually a relief to me

16:14.999 --> 16:16.999
after all these years to
actually bring a girl around

16:16.999 --> 16:19.999
because for the longest time,
I was always flying solo.

16:19.999 --> 16:22.000
Jax, for instance, he has
a different girl every week,

16:22.000 --> 16:23.999
but I'm not gonna
bring around a girl

16:23.999 --> 16:26.999
unless I know it's gonna be
a little serious.

16:26.999 --> 16:27.999
- Peter and I

16:27.999 --> 16:30.999
have something
to tell you guys.

16:30.999 --> 16:31.999
- Oh.
- Oh, my God,

16:31.999 --> 16:32.999
you guys are
getting married!

16:32.999 --> 16:34.999
- Not yet, not yet.

16:34.999 --> 16:37.999
I think I'm gonna be getting
some training soon.

16:37.999 --> 16:38.999
As far as that
department goes.

16:38.999 --> 16:39.999
- What do you mean?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.999
- I have a four-year-old.

16:41.999 --> 16:43.999
- Aww.

16:43.999 --> 16:44.999
- We've never met

16:44.999 --> 16:46.999
a real grown-up with
responsibilities.

16:47.999 --> 16:49.999
- Listen, I love kids.

16:49.999 --> 16:51.999
I love 'em.
I wanna have one.

16:51.999 --> 16:53.999
But you know,
in like, the distant,

16:53.999 --> 16:55.999
distant, far-off future.

16:55.999 --> 16:57.999
What's that?

16:57.999 --> 16:59.999
I can barely make it out.

16:59.999 --> 17:01.999
I think it's a kid but
it's like, so far away

17:01.999 --> 17:03.999
I can't really tell.

17:03.999 --> 17:04.999
It could be a dog.

17:04.999 --> 17:06.999
- What do you guys
think about, like,

17:06.999 --> 17:08.999
marriage and kids and...?

17:08.999 --> 17:10.999
- I've always
thought of marriage

17:10.999 --> 17:12.999
as something that was
really far off and now

17:12.999 --> 17:14.999
because of Ariana, like, I--

17:14.999 --> 17:19.999
dude, if you--I can see--
I would marry you.

17:19.999 --> 17:20.999
- That's a good thing.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.999
- Just saying.

17:22.999 --> 17:23.999
- Babe, that's really nice.

17:23.999 --> 17:24.999
- You should be with
someone who's worth it.

17:24.999 --> 17:26.999
- Oh, no.

17:26.999 --> 17:29.999
- I've never wanted to
be married or have kids.

17:29.999 --> 17:33.999
At five years old,
I just knew it wasn't for me.

17:33.999 --> 17:35.999
- Ariana's squirming.

17:35.999 --> 17:36.999
- I'm committed to Tom,

17:36.999 --> 17:39.999
but I don't see marriage
as, like, a goal.

17:39.999 --> 17:40.999
- Ariana doesn't want that.

17:40.999 --> 17:41.999
- She's worse than me.

17:41.999 --> 17:44.999
- There's this very subtle

17:44.999 --> 17:47.999
battle of wills
that me and Ariana have.

17:47.999 --> 17:49.999
Will we get married?
Will we not?

17:49.999 --> 17:52.999
Like, I just have to be
so awesome

17:52.999 --> 17:54.999
that she can't help
but want to marry me.

17:54.999 --> 17:56.999
- That was great.
Now it's your turn.

17:56.999 --> 17:58.999
- Schwartz, he's got this one.
- Both of you.

17:58.999 --> 18:00.999
- What do you want me to say?

18:00.999 --> 18:01.999
- Deadlines.

18:01.999 --> 18:02.999
- I love deadlines.

18:02.999 --> 18:03.999
I love ultimatums.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.999
I like pressure.
All that sh**.

18:07.999 --> 18:10.999
I love her so much.
She's so amazing.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.999
- I love Schwartz,
and he's so cute.

18:12.999 --> 18:13.999
I'm like, but he's f***ing
probably one of

18:13.999 --> 18:15.999
the most annoying people
I've known in my life.

18:15.999 --> 18:16.999
I can't stand him

18:16.999 --> 18:18.999
90% of the time.
- That's not a fair assessment.

18:18.999 --> 18:21.999
- You know who was missing
last night from guy's night?

18:21.999 --> 18:22.999
- Who?
- Michael Shay.

18:22.999 --> 18:23.999
- f*** Shay, man.

18:23.999 --> 18:24.999
- Why "f*** Shay," dude?

18:24.999 --> 18:26.999
- They're having
some issues.

18:26.999 --> 18:29.999
You know, some--some big sh**.

18:29.999 --> 18:31.999
Shay's staying
at his parents' house.

18:31.999 --> 18:32.999
They're not actually
really talking right now.

18:32.999 --> 18:34.999
He's been drinking
a lot lately,

18:34.999 --> 18:35.999
and taking pills.

18:35.999 --> 18:37.999
- You can--it's clear
right now that--

18:37.999 --> 18:38.999
you can tell they're
not communicating.

18:38.999 --> 18:40.999
Like, the most
important thing to do

18:40.999 --> 18:41.999
when you are in a fight
with your significant other

18:41.999 --> 18:44.999
is to talk to your
significant other about it.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.999
Scheana can be bossy,
and she can be domineering.

18:47.999 --> 18:50.999
And sometimes Shay feels
like he gets stepped on.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.999
- It's so crazy,
'cause the last time

18:52.999 --> 18:54.999
I like, really like,
had a conversation with them,

18:54.999 --> 18:55.999
Scheana was like,
trying to figure out like,

18:56.000 --> 18:57.999
what names sound
cute with Shay.

18:57.999 --> 19:00.999
- I feel like they never fought
up until now.

19:00.999 --> 19:02.999
- Both of them
are really good

19:02.999 --> 19:04.999
at the happy face.

19:04.999 --> 19:06.999
I think it's hard
for both of them

19:06.999 --> 19:09.999
to--to come to a friend

19:09.999 --> 19:11.999
and say like, things aren't
necessarily awesome.

19:11.999 --> 19:12.999
Sometimes Scheana can make

19:12.999 --> 19:14.999
a big deal
out of little problems,

19:14.999 --> 19:17.999
but you very rarely hear
about big problems from her.

19:17.999 --> 19:21.999
And I feel like,
maybe this problem has become

19:21.999 --> 19:25.999
so big that she's being
forced to talk about it.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.999
- And when you're depressed
and you drink,

19:27.999 --> 19:29.999
you get more depressed
and more--like, you--

19:29.999 --> 19:31.999
it's really hard
to dig yourself out of that.

19:31.999 --> 19:33.999
- And I understand, dude.

19:33.999 --> 19:36.999
He hasn't had steady money
coming in, like--

19:36.999 --> 19:38.999
and I know that feeling.
I've been there.

19:38.999 --> 19:41.999
Shay is really having sort of
man problems right now.

19:41.999 --> 19:44.999
I mean, he--
because he feels like

19:44.999 --> 19:47.999
he's not providing enough
monetarily,

19:47.999 --> 19:49.999
he doesn't feel as important.

19:49.999 --> 19:52.999
I've definitely
gone through that before.

19:52.999 --> 19:54.999
Scheana has a little bit
of that anger right now,

19:54.999 --> 19:55.999
from what I got from her
towards Shay.

19:55.999 --> 19:58.999
It's just not fair.

19:58.999 --> 20:00.000
And so, she needs somebody
to sort of

20:00.999 --> 20:01.999
step in and like,

20:01.999 --> 20:02.999
come from the other side.

20:02.999 --> 20:05.999
They're having issues,
we're all friends,

20:05.999 --> 20:06.999
we've all been there
for each other.

20:06.999 --> 20:07.999
Scheana's been there for me,

20:07.999 --> 20:10.999
in so many ways,

20:10.999 --> 20:13.999
and, like, they need our help.

20:13.999 --> 20:14.999
- Yeah.

20:16.999 --> 20:17.999
- Coming up...

20:17.999 --> 20:19.999
- There's a swan right there.

20:19.999 --> 20:21.999
- Yeah, literally it just
pissed out its ass.

20:21.999 --> 20:23.999
- I do that
when I'm around Lisa too.

20:23.999 --> 20:24.999
- I know you do.

20:33.999 --> 20:34.999
♪ You make me lose my mind ♪

20:34.999 --> 20:40.999
♪ I like the way you put
your hand in mine ♪

20:42.999 --> 20:43.999
- The salmon.
- The salmon?

20:43.999 --> 20:45.999
Okay, perfect.
All right.

20:45.999 --> 20:47.999
♪ I like the little things
you say and do ♪

20:47.999 --> 20:50.999
- There you go, man.

20:50.999 --> 20:53.999
- I know, I don't have
anything for tonight.

20:53.999 --> 20:54.999
I'm completely booked up.

20:54.999 --> 20:57.999
Yeah, I could see
if we have something--

20:57.999 --> 21:00.999
No, and I completely understand

21:00.999 --> 21:03.999
but tonight is--
will absolutely not work at all.

21:03.999 --> 21:05.999
All right,
have a great one.

21:05.999 --> 21:08.999
Bye-bye.

21:08.999 --> 21:09.999
Hi, Mister.

21:09.999 --> 21:11.999
- Hi, darling.

21:11.999 --> 21:12.999
- You're DJing tonight?

21:12.999 --> 21:13.999
- Yeah, Lisa--
I was bussing,

21:13.999 --> 21:16.999
but Lisa called me up--
she called me up, she said,

21:16.999 --> 21:18.999
"Oh, yeah, if you wanna do
a little DJing tonight,

21:18.999 --> 21:19.999
you can, uh--you can
go ahead and do that."

21:19.999 --> 21:21.999
I was like,
"Uh, yeah, lovely."

21:21.999 --> 21:23.999
- You're much sexier as a DJ
than a busser.

21:23.999 --> 21:25.999
- Oh, you like that, darling?
- Yeah.

21:26.999 --> 21:28.999
I'll play some good stuff
for you later.

21:28.999 --> 21:29.999
- I know.
I love everything you play.

21:29.999 --> 21:31.999
So, I think we'll be good.

21:31.999 --> 21:32.999
- Don't you sing a little bit?

21:32.999 --> 21:33.999
I mean, for such
a gorgeous girl,

21:33.999 --> 21:35.999
I'm sure you've got, you know,
the voice of an angel.

21:35.999 --> 21:36.999
- I sing a little bit, yeah.

21:36.999 --> 21:37.999
- A little bit?

21:37.999 --> 21:38.999
I bet I could make you

21:38.999 --> 21:39.999
sound f***ing gorgeous.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.999
Would you have fun
doing that, darling?

21:41.999 --> 21:42.999
- Yeah, I would love it.
- Cool.

21:42.999 --> 21:45.999
As much as I want it
to work out with Kristen and I,

21:45.999 --> 21:47.999
I have to say, I've got
a bit of a wandering eye.

21:47.999 --> 21:48.999
I'ma have a little bit of fun
with this one.

21:48.999 --> 21:50.999
I don't need to spell it out
for you, do I?

21:50.999 --> 21:51.999
You're so pretty.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.999
- Thank you.
You're making me blush.

21:54.999 --> 21:56.999
- Am I?
- You're making me hot--yeah.

22:05.999 --> 22:07.999
- Dude, how you feeling?
You feeling good about this?

22:08.000 --> 22:09.999
- Me too.

22:11.999 --> 22:13.999
- I was thinking of like,
upscale casual.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.999
Like we're going on, like,
a Lexus audition, you know?

22:15.999 --> 22:16.999
Young, professional.

22:16.999 --> 22:17.999
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:17.999 --> 22:19.999
- Aspirational.

22:19.999 --> 22:20.999
- Yeah, yeah, like a button--

22:20.999 --> 22:22.999
yeah, okay, cool, a button-up.

22:22.999 --> 22:23.999
One thing I know
from auditioning

22:23.999 --> 22:24.999
is if you wanna get the part,

22:24.999 --> 22:26.999
you gotta dress
and look the part.

22:26.999 --> 22:27.999
All right, dude,
come pick me up.

22:27.999 --> 22:29.999
I'll be looking sharp.

22:29.999 --> 22:31.999
Me and Tom are both excited
about the prospect

22:31.999 --> 22:33.000
with Lisa and the sangria.

22:34.999 --> 22:37.999
So, I'm just, uh,
trying to dress like a guy

22:37.999 --> 22:39.999
that Lisa Vanderpump
would be in business with.

22:39.999 --> 22:42.999
You got this.

22:45.999 --> 22:47.999
♪ Head over my heart ♪

22:47.999 --> 22:49.999
♪ Heart over my head ♪

22:49.999 --> 22:51.999
♪ I'm giving in,
you're giving up ♪

22:51.999 --> 22:53.999
♪ You got me
wrapped around again ♪

22:53.999 --> 22:55.999
- Dude, I swear,
this place gets bigger

22:55.999 --> 22:56.999
every time I come here.

22:56.999 --> 22:58.000
- There's a swan right there.

22:58.999 --> 23:00.999
- Yeah, it literally just
pissed out its ass.

23:00.999 --> 23:01.999
- I do that
when I'm around Lisa too.

23:01.999 --> 23:03.000
- I know you do.

23:03.999 --> 23:04.000
You better hold it
together today.

23:04.999 --> 23:05.999
- I know,
I gotta, I gotta.

23:05.999 --> 23:06.999
Let's be real.

23:06.999 --> 23:09.999
Any time you're
propositioning Lisa,

23:09.999 --> 23:11.999
there's always gonna be
a little bit of nerves there.

23:11.999 --> 23:12.999
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:12.999 --> 23:14.999
- Hello.
- Here to see Lisa.

23:14.999 --> 23:15.999
- Okay, we come in?

23:15.999 --> 23:16.999
- Yeah, of course.

23:16.999 --> 23:18.999
- Should we take our shoes off?
- No, no.

23:18.999 --> 23:20.000
- No, no, it's okay.

23:20.999 --> 23:22.999
- But I'm more worried about
Schwartz than I am myself.

23:22.999 --> 23:24.999
So I'm gonna try to
take the lead on this one.

23:24.999 --> 23:26.999
Villa Rosa.

23:26.999 --> 23:27.999
- I know, I want a house
that's named.

23:27.999 --> 23:30.999
I want the moat
with the swans in there

23:30.999 --> 23:32.999
and seven dogs running around,

23:32.999 --> 23:34.999
and when you walk into my house,
you're just sort of

23:34.999 --> 23:36.999
afraid to touch anything
'cause it feels like a museum.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.999
I want that.

23:38.999 --> 23:40.999
I feel like a--a peasant

23:40.999 --> 23:41.999
who's been invited
into the castle.

23:41.999 --> 23:43.999
- But I think this is
gonna go well, man.

23:43.999 --> 23:46.999
We both have our strengths.
- Well, yeah.

23:46.999 --> 23:47.999
- Hello, you guys.

23:47.999 --> 23:48.999
- Oh, hi.
- Hey, Lisa.

23:48.999 --> 23:49.999
- How long you been
standing there?

23:50.000 --> 23:51.999
Yeah.

23:51.999 --> 23:53.999
- There comes a time
when some of my employees,

23:53.999 --> 23:54.999
they want to spread
their wings.

23:54.999 --> 23:56.999
I'm not sure
if they quite understand

23:56.999 --> 23:58.999
what they're
getting into exactly.

23:58.999 --> 24:00.999
But I'll see.
I have an open mind.

24:00.999 --> 24:02.999
- Before we get
into business, though,

24:02.999 --> 24:03.999
I didn't want to,
uh, tell you

24:03.999 --> 24:05.999
Scheana told us about Shay.

24:05.999 --> 24:07.999
We know pretty much
everything that you know.

24:07.999 --> 24:08.999
- You do?
- Yeah.

24:08.999 --> 24:09.999
I know things
have been

24:09.999 --> 24:10.999
sort of building up
with him too,

24:10.999 --> 24:12.999
because, you know,
Scheana right now

24:12.999 --> 24:13.999
is kind of like,
paying for everything.

24:13.999 --> 24:14.999
And he feels
a bit like--

24:14.999 --> 24:17.999
- Emasculated.
- Exactly.

24:17.999 --> 24:21.999
And I feel like Shay
just needs a jump start.

24:21.999 --> 24:24.999
I wanna ask you
if there's any possibility...

24:24.999 --> 24:26.999
- What's coming?
- We could give Shay

24:26.999 --> 24:27.999
a job at Pump.
- A job?

24:27.999 --> 24:30.000
- At Pump, away from--
just hear me out.

24:30.999 --> 24:31.999
- It's not gonna help.

24:31.999 --> 24:32.999
It's not gonna help.

24:32.999 --> 24:34.999
- Just--Lisa,
for one second, like--

24:34.999 --> 24:35.999
- Why would I
give him a job?

24:35.999 --> 24:39.000
He needs to get clean
and he needs to get sober.

24:39.999 --> 24:40.999
And he needs to get
his sh** together.

24:40.999 --> 24:41.999
- He is--he has been.

24:41.999 --> 24:43.999
- And coming to work for me
is not gonna help that.

24:43.999 --> 24:47.999
It touches me
how kind they are

24:47.999 --> 24:49.999
when it comes to Shay.

24:49.999 --> 24:52.999
But I don't think really
the best solution for Shay,

24:52.999 --> 24:55.999
who's struggling
with addiction to alcohol,

24:55.999 --> 24:57.000
is to come and work at my bar.

24:57.999 --> 24:58.999
Hi, darling, how are you?

24:58.999 --> 24:59.999
- How you doing?
Hey, guys.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.999
- Hey, dude.
- Good to see you, man.

25:01.999 --> 25:02.999
- It's been a long time.
- Hi.

25:02.999 --> 25:03.999
- Hi.
- You look gorgeous.

25:03.999 --> 25:05.999
- I gotta say,
I like the shaved head.

25:05.999 --> 25:07.999
- Thank you.
Feels good.

25:07.999 --> 25:08.999
- Kind of goes
with anything.

25:08.999 --> 25:09.999
- Yeah, you look good.

25:09.999 --> 25:10.999
I'm really digging
the shaved head.

25:10.999 --> 25:11.999
- Appreciate it.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.999
- I'm not, uh--
I'm not brownnosing here,

25:13.999 --> 25:15.999
but, uh, Jason is very handsome.

25:15.999 --> 25:19.000
Jason almost looks like
the model version

25:19.999 --> 25:20.999
of a successful businessman,
you know?

25:20.999 --> 25:23.999
Except for that he actually
is a successful businessman.

25:23.999 --> 25:25.999
Me, I'm still a model.

25:25.999 --> 25:27.999
- One of the reasons why

25:27.999 --> 25:29.999
we're here is
because I think

25:29.999 --> 25:31.999
the sangria is
an amazing product,

25:31.999 --> 25:33.999
and, uh, I like the fact

25:33.999 --> 25:35.999
that it's not too sweet.

25:35.999 --> 25:37.999
Obviously, you know,
a great name.

25:37.999 --> 25:39.999
Lisa Vanderpump Sangria.

25:39.999 --> 25:40.999
Schwartz did--he did use to
work in wine and spirits.

25:40.999 --> 25:41.999
- Oh, yeah, that's my--

25:41.999 --> 25:43.999
I don't know if you guys
know that.

25:43.999 --> 25:44.999
That's what
my background is in.

25:44.999 --> 25:46.999
I have always planned on
getting back

25:46.999 --> 25:47.999
into the wine and spirits
business at some point.

25:47.999 --> 25:49.999
'Cause I'm familiar
with the industry.

25:49.999 --> 25:50.999
I know you are
somewhat, too.

25:50.999 --> 25:51.999
- I am, actually,

25:51.999 --> 25:53.999
and I really feel like

25:53.999 --> 25:54.999
I could push a product
in St. Louis,

25:54.999 --> 25:55.999
and just get
right to the point.

25:55.999 --> 25:56.999
I go back to St. Louis

25:56.999 --> 25:58.999
almost four times a year,

25:58.999 --> 26:00.999
and I know everybody.

26:00.999 --> 26:02.999
And if I don't know them,
my friends know them.

26:02.999 --> 26:05.999
You know, I have
a reputation in St. Louis.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.999
I'm a good time,
I'm a straight-shooter,

26:07.999 --> 26:08.999
and on top of that,

26:08.999 --> 26:10.999
I've just gotten to know
tons of people,

26:10.999 --> 26:12.999
and I feel like
I could offer something

26:12.999 --> 26:14.999
in St. Louis, right off the bat.

26:14.999 --> 26:15.999
It's not just about

26:15.999 --> 26:18.999
getting the sangria to--

26:18.999 --> 26:20.999
at the bar
and at the restaurant.

26:20.999 --> 26:23.999
It's about getting it
into people's hands.

26:23.999 --> 26:24.999
When I'm out there
in St. Louis,

26:24.999 --> 26:27.999
I would order some
of the LVP Sangria.

26:27.999 --> 26:29.999
They'd be like,
"Oh, what's that?"

26:29.999 --> 26:31.999
Of course people
would ask immediately.

26:31.999 --> 26:32.999
"What is that?"
and I'm like,

26:32.999 --> 26:34.999
"Oh, this is
Lisa Vanderpump Sangria.

26:34.999 --> 26:36.999
It's--here, try it."

26:36.999 --> 26:37.999
And people start talking
about it.

26:37.999 --> 26:39.999
- I know--I know the kind
of thing that you're thinking.

26:39.999 --> 26:40.999
But you have to understand

26:40.999 --> 26:41.999
that if you're gonna
approach this,

26:41.999 --> 26:43.999
you need to broaden
your horizons.

26:43.999 --> 26:46.999
This can't just be like,
"I'm going up to little clubs

26:46.999 --> 26:48.999
and pubs and bars
in St. Louis."

26:48.999 --> 26:50.999
I would want you to
be thinking globally.

26:50.999 --> 26:52.999
I don't think that
they quite understood

26:52.999 --> 26:54.999
how big this brand has got.

26:54.999 --> 26:58.999
These two have been in
God knows how many cities

26:58.999 --> 26:59.999
in the last few months.

26:59.999 --> 27:00.999
- Just got back from--
from Rome.

27:00.999 --> 27:03.999
Miami, London,
in the last week, so...

27:03.999 --> 27:04.999
- Killing it, man.
- Wow.

27:04.999 --> 27:06.999
- Talking to Australia,
it's in Turkey.

27:06.999 --> 27:07.999
- We have a meeting

27:07.999 --> 27:10.999
with a 3,000-store chain
in Australia.

27:10.999 --> 27:11.999
That gets picked up,

27:11.999 --> 27:13.999
the company goes
from here to there.

27:13.999 --> 27:15.999
We get résumés
submitted every day,

27:15.999 --> 27:16.999
'cause it's
a big company

27:16.999 --> 27:18.999
and it's international now.

27:18.999 --> 27:20.999
But obviously,
we'd rather go with people

27:20.999 --> 27:21.999
who are passionate about it

27:21.999 --> 27:23.999
and who know it.
You better not be

27:23.999 --> 27:27.999
having mental breakdowns
and crying and leaving.

27:27.999 --> 27:29.999
What I would suggest is,

27:29.999 --> 27:31.999
think about it,
and sort of

27:31.999 --> 27:33.999
put together a little plan

27:33.999 --> 27:35.999
and bring it
back to me.

27:35.999 --> 27:36.999
- We do need some time
to think about this.

27:36.999 --> 27:37.999
- Yeah.

27:37.999 --> 27:38.999
- Thanks again

27:38.999 --> 27:39.999
for meeting us and stuff.

27:39.999 --> 27:42.999
- Just don't
screw any of us around.

27:42.999 --> 27:43.999
- Of course not.

27:43.999 --> 27:45.999
- Good to see you, Tom.
- Awesome.

27:45.999 --> 27:47.999
We're not walking out of here

27:47.999 --> 27:49.999
with a six-figure salary
and 401Ks.

27:49.999 --> 27:51.999
We're sort of walking out with,
like, a homework assignment.

27:51.999 --> 27:52.999
That's kind of lame,
but I guess it's better than

27:52.999 --> 27:53.999
walking out with a no.

27:53.999 --> 27:54.999
- Good to see you guys.
- Thanks a lot.

27:54.999 --> 27:55.999
- Good seeing you.
- Bye.

27:58.999 --> 28:00.999
- Coming up...

28:00.999 --> 28:02.999
- Why did you marry me?
Why?

28:02.999 --> 28:03.999
Do you regret marrying me?

28:03.999 --> 28:04.999
Like, why?

28:26.999 --> 28:28.999
- Hello, hi.
- Hi.

28:28.999 --> 28:29.999
- Shut the door, please.

28:29.999 --> 28:31.999
How are you?

28:31.999 --> 28:32.999
- Hi.

28:32.999 --> 28:34.999
- Hey, mama.

28:34.999 --> 28:35.999
What's up, mama?
- Hello.

28:35.999 --> 28:37.999
- How are you?
- Good.

28:37.999 --> 28:42.999
Shay hasn't been here
in a minute, so--

28:42.999 --> 28:44.999
Shay and I have talked,
and we both decided

28:44.999 --> 28:46.999
more time apart
is not an option.

28:46.999 --> 28:48.999
I'm, like, looking at
all these wedding pictures

28:48.999 --> 28:50.999
and it's just like,
it's depressing.

28:50.999 --> 28:52.999
'Cause it's, like, we were
that happy and now we're not.

28:52.999 --> 28:56.999
So, the only option is
for him to come home

28:56.999 --> 28:58.999
and fix it.

28:58.999 --> 28:59.999
Hey.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.999
- Hey, guys.
- What's up, guys?

29:01.999 --> 29:02.999
Hey, dude.

29:02.999 --> 29:04.999
- Hey, man.
- What's going on?

29:04.999 --> 29:05.999
Nice stripes.

29:05.999 --> 29:06.999
- Thanks, man.

29:06.999 --> 29:08.999
- Here we all are.

29:08.999 --> 29:11.999
I wanted you guys to be here
'cause I felt like

29:11.999 --> 29:13.999
having a buffer
would make him more comfortable.

29:13.999 --> 29:15.999
He's more comfortable
talking in a group setting

29:15.999 --> 29:17.999
than one-on-one.

29:17.999 --> 29:19.999
- It is very, very strange

29:19.999 --> 29:22.999
that Scheana and Shay
want us all here.

29:22.999 --> 29:26.999
But if us being here helps them,

29:26.999 --> 29:29.999
then of course
we're glad to do it.

29:29.999 --> 29:31.999
- At the end of this,
I just really hope

29:31.999 --> 29:35.999
he knows that he has
a good support system in LA.

29:35.999 --> 29:38.999
He doesn't have to
run home to Mom and Dad's

29:38.999 --> 29:40.999
to escape this life.

29:40.999 --> 29:42.999
We're married.
There's no running away.

29:42.999 --> 29:44.999
- What's up, man?

29:44.999 --> 29:45.999
- What up?

29:45.999 --> 29:46.999
Hi, Shay.

29:46.999 --> 29:49.999
- Give me some love, homey.

29:52.999 --> 29:53.999
- Dude, I missed you, man.

29:53.999 --> 29:55.999
- It's been so long
since we've seen you.

29:55.999 --> 29:58.999
- Hey.

29:58.999 --> 30:01.999
We missed you.

30:01.999 --> 30:05.999
- Saved the best for last.

30:19.999 --> 30:22.000
- Shay, what's up, dude?
You're making us all cry.

30:28.999 --> 30:31.999
- What have you
been up to, man?

30:31.999 --> 30:34.999
- I've been home
for over a week.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.999
I stayed with my parents.

30:36.999 --> 30:39.999
Um, I've been going through
a lot of stuff personally,

30:39.999 --> 30:43.999
and I kind of, like, ran away.

30:43.999 --> 30:47.999
- I mean, I guess you got
my text messages, right?

30:47.999 --> 30:49.999
- Yeah, I got all your messages.

30:49.999 --> 30:51.999
I kind of just

30:51.999 --> 30:54.999
cut everyone off,
unfortunately.

30:54.999 --> 30:56.999
- No explanation needed
in that department.

30:56.999 --> 30:57.999
Completely get it.

30:57.999 --> 30:59.999
- Due, yeah, that happens, man.

30:59.999 --> 31:02.999
I just want you to know, man,
like, we're here, dude.

31:02.999 --> 31:04.999
We are f***ing here.

31:04.999 --> 31:08.999
And, Shay, I'm asking you,

31:08.999 --> 31:13.999
do you feel like you were
addicted to pills?

31:13.999 --> 31:15.999
Or do you feel like
you were just,

31:15.999 --> 31:17.999
like, if you didn't
have those pills,

31:17.999 --> 31:20.999
did you feel
withdrawal symptoms?

31:20.999 --> 31:22.999
- Mm-hmm.
- You did?

31:22.999 --> 31:24.999
Holy sh**.

31:26.999 --> 31:28.999
How many were you
taking a day?

31:28.999 --> 31:31.999
- On average,
probably like five.

31:31.999 --> 31:33.999
- Wow.

31:33.999 --> 31:34.999
- Wow.

31:34.999 --> 31:38.999
- The most I've ever taken
is probably, like, ten in a day.

31:38.999 --> 31:40.999
- What?

31:40.999 --> 31:42.999
- Oh, my gosh.

31:42.999 --> 31:43.999
- Ever since
I've known you guys,

31:43.999 --> 31:45.999
I've always been on them.

31:45.999 --> 31:46.999
- Holy sh**.

31:46.999 --> 31:47.999
- Instead of paying bills
some months,

31:47.999 --> 31:51.000
he would just buy pills.

31:51.999 --> 31:52.999
- Hearing some of the sh**

31:52.999 --> 31:54.999
that Shay's going through,
it's scary.

31:54.999 --> 31:57.999
By all accounts, I mean,
this is a real addiction.

31:57.999 --> 32:00.999
It makes me feel like--
we're in our 30s now.

32:00.999 --> 32:01.999
Maybe we can't get away
with some of the sh**

32:01.999 --> 32:03.999
that we did in our 20s,
you know?

32:03.999 --> 32:04.999
- I knew you would judge me.

32:04.999 --> 32:06.999
That was one big reason

32:06.999 --> 32:08.999
that I never
talked to you about it.

32:08.999 --> 32:10.999
- Did you have some guy
that you'd get them from?

32:10.999 --> 32:12.999
- Through multiple people.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.999
- Really?
Holy sh**.

32:14.999 --> 32:15.999
- Things that an addict does,

32:15.999 --> 32:16.999
and I didn't know
I married an addict.

32:16.999 --> 32:18.999
I didn't know he had
all these problems.

32:18.999 --> 32:20.999
I would've helped him
years ago.

32:20.999 --> 32:22.999
Like, I just feel like

32:22.999 --> 32:23.999
you're miserable with me.

32:23.999 --> 32:25.999
- I'm not.
- But it feels that way.

32:25.999 --> 32:27.999
- I'm not, though.

32:27.999 --> 32:28.999
- You were just

32:28.999 --> 32:31.999
so blacked-out drunk
and depressed.

32:31.999 --> 32:33.999
You just
haven't been happy.

32:33.999 --> 32:36.999
I have been so--

32:36.999 --> 32:39.999
so miserable and lonely
this past week.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.999
Like, thank God I have
the most amazing friends.

32:41.999 --> 32:44.999
- I've been so miserable
and lonely for two years.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
- Why did you marry me?
Why?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.999
Do you regret marrying me?

32:51.999 --> 32:52.999
Like, why?
- Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no.

32:52.999 --> 32:53.999
- Scheana, stop.

32:57.999 --> 32:58.999
- I'm glad they're here

32:58.999 --> 33:00.999
because when I have
conversations with you,

33:00.999 --> 33:02.999
I'm, like,
intimidated by you.

33:02.999 --> 33:04.999
The second maybe
I, like, start expressing

33:04.999 --> 33:06.999
or get upset or something,

33:06.999 --> 33:07.999
you cut me off

33:07.999 --> 33:11.999
and you take completely
over the conversation.

33:11.999 --> 33:13.999
- If he's saying
that you intimidate him,

33:13.999 --> 33:15.999
you scare him sometimes
in conversations,

33:15.999 --> 33:16.999
like, you need to
take that to heart.

33:16.999 --> 33:19.999
- I'd rather just stay quiet
and not have confrontation--

33:19.999 --> 33:21.999
- That's not okay.

33:21.999 --> 33:22.999
- But I can't get anything
out, though.

33:22.999 --> 33:23.999
- But you need to
tell me these things.

33:23.999 --> 33:24.999
Don't wait for it
to blow up

33:24.999 --> 33:26.999
to tell me, like,
you f***ing hate me.

33:26.999 --> 33:28.999
- I don't hate you.

33:28.999 --> 33:31.999
- Shay needs to speak up more.

33:31.999 --> 33:33.999
Scheana needs to listen more.

33:33.999 --> 33:34.999
And if they can figure out

33:34.999 --> 33:36.999
a place to meet in all of that,

33:36.999 --> 33:40.999
I think that
they'll both be happy.

33:40.999 --> 33:42.999
- I just don't want you
to regret marrying me.

33:42.999 --> 33:43.999
- I don't.
I never--no.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.999
And like, hurting you
and seeing you cry,

33:45.999 --> 33:46.999
like, kills me.

33:46.999 --> 33:47.999
And I just wanna apologize

33:47.999 --> 33:50.999
for the dumb decisions
I have made.

33:50.999 --> 33:52.999
I went home
'cause I needed to.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.999
But I feel bad
leaving you, you know?

33:55.999 --> 33:57.999
And to defend for yourself.

33:57.999 --> 33:59.000
But I got my mind right.

33:59.999 --> 34:01.999
I got--you know, I just
got a lot of things out.

34:01.999 --> 34:03.999
- I mean, you came back,

34:03.999 --> 34:04.999
but you don't really have a bag.

34:04.999 --> 34:06.999
So, like, I mean,
are you staying?

34:06.999 --> 34:08.999
Or are you going back
to your parents'? I mean...

34:08.999 --> 34:11.999
- No, I'm staying.
- Yay.

34:11.999 --> 34:12.999
- You're staying?
- I wanna come home, yeah.

34:12.999 --> 34:14.999
- Yeah!
- Welcome back, man.

34:14.999 --> 34:15.999
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

34:15.999 --> 34:17.999
There's just a lot of things

34:17.999 --> 34:18.999
I have to--I have to work on.

34:18.999 --> 34:20.999
- It would help me too

34:20.999 --> 34:24.999
if you just, like,
literally speak up more

34:24.999 --> 34:25.999
and cut me off.

34:25.999 --> 34:28.999
'Cause, like,
you're just so

34:28.999 --> 34:30.999
polite and like,
quiet, and like,

34:30.999 --> 34:34.999
I'll just be on, like, rambling
and rambling and rambling,

34:34.999 --> 34:35.999
and then you'll just,
like, get, like, a word in,

34:35.999 --> 34:37.999
and then I keep talking
and talking and talking.

34:37.999 --> 34:38.999
Like, sometimes
you can be like,

34:38.999 --> 34:39.999
"Can you stop
and let me finish?"

34:39.999 --> 34:40.999
- Like right now would be

34:40.999 --> 34:43.999
a really good time
to say that.

34:44.999 --> 34:45.999
- Coming up...

34:45.999 --> 34:47.999
- One thing I want to ask you,

34:47.999 --> 34:48.999
which I did ask you last time.

34:48.999 --> 34:50.999
- Mm-hmm.
- Where's your résumé?

34:50.999 --> 34:52.999
- Oh, yeah.

34:52.999 --> 34:53.999
- Okay.

35:00.999 --> 35:04.999
♪ And all that's
coming true ♪

35:04.999 --> 35:07.999
♪ Set aside for a time
like this ♪

35:07.999 --> 35:10.999
♪ And it's happening with me ♪

35:10.999 --> 35:12.999
♪ And you ♪

35:12.999 --> 35:15.999
♪ Together as one ♪

35:15.999 --> 35:16.999
- Hello.

35:16.999 --> 35:17.999
- Hi.
- Hello.

35:17.999 --> 35:18.999
- Remember Brittany?
- How are you?

35:19.000 --> 35:20.999
- Yes.

35:20.999 --> 35:21.999
- Good to see you again.
- How are you?

35:21.999 --> 35:23.999
- Great, how are you?

35:23.999 --> 35:25.999
- Back for more?

35:25.999 --> 35:26.999
- Yeah.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.999
- Okay, so you still
wanna work at Sur?

35:28.999 --> 35:29.999
- Of course.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.999
- I thought I'd give this girl,

35:31.999 --> 35:34.999
Brittany, another chance,
because Jax had asked me to.

35:34.999 --> 35:37.999
But I mean, she's virtually
in her underwear.

35:37.999 --> 35:38.999
Again.

35:38.999 --> 35:39.999
- Nice to meet you.
I'm Brittany.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.999
- Hi, Brittany.

35:41.999 --> 35:43.999
Okay, so, one thing
I want to ask you,

35:43.999 --> 35:44.999
which I did ask you last time.

35:44.999 --> 35:46.999
- Mm-hmm.
- Where's your résumé?

35:47.000 --> 35:48.999
- Oh, yeah.

35:48.999 --> 35:50.999
We should've brought that.

35:50.999 --> 35:52.999
- Well, I mean--

35:52.999 --> 35:54.999
- It's always a good idea
when you go to a job interview,

35:54.999 --> 35:55.999
to bring your résumé.

35:55.999 --> 35:57.999
If I employ somebody,
I wanna know

35:57.999 --> 36:00.999
exactly who they are,
what they've done,

36:00.999 --> 36:01.999
where they've been.
- I know.

36:01.999 --> 36:03.999
- So let's be honest,
I mean, really,

36:03.999 --> 36:05.999
Brittany's looks
are her résumé.

36:05.999 --> 36:06.999
That should be enough.

36:06.999 --> 36:08.999
- So tell me off
the top of your head,

36:08.999 --> 36:09.999
what restaurants
have you worked at?

36:09.999 --> 36:12.999
- Um, I've worked at Hooters.

36:14.999 --> 36:15.999
- Hooters?

36:15.999 --> 36:17.999
- Yes.

36:17.999 --> 36:18.999
- Why did you say that?

36:18.999 --> 36:20.999
- I had to tell her
the truth.

36:20.999 --> 36:21.999
- Okay.

36:21.999 --> 36:23.999
It's just, sometimes

36:23.999 --> 36:25.000
everyone thinks,
"Oh, Hooters."

36:25.999 --> 36:27.999
It's just kind of...

36:27.999 --> 36:28.999
You know, what are you gonna do?

36:28.999 --> 36:29.999
- Is that where you met?

36:29.999 --> 36:30.999
- No.

36:30.999 --> 36:32.000
- No, we met in Vegas, okay.

36:32.999 --> 36:33.999
Listen, she's telling you
her résumé.

36:33.999 --> 36:35.000
- Why do they call it Hooters
again?

36:35.999 --> 36:37.999
- Because you wear, like,
the little outfits.

36:37.999 --> 36:39.999
- More than you're wearing now?

36:39.999 --> 36:41.000
- Uh, yeah.

36:42.999 --> 36:45.999
- Jax thinks the only experience
that she needs

36:45.999 --> 36:47.999
is in bed with him,
and it's not.

36:47.999 --> 36:50.999
So she's actually done me
a favor not bringing her résumé,

36:50.999 --> 36:52.999
because it's just kind of
like a gift, really.

36:52.999 --> 36:53.999
I have the excuse I need.

36:53.999 --> 36:54.999
Sorry.

36:54.999 --> 36:56.999
It will not work out,

36:56.999 --> 36:58.999
her working at Sur now.

36:58.999 --> 37:00.999
Now you guys
are together,

37:00.999 --> 37:02.999
because I can see
is problematic.

37:02.999 --> 37:03.999
It makes it
more complicated.

37:03.999 --> 37:05.999
- Well, it doesn't if you don't
work in the same restaurant.

37:05.999 --> 37:06.999
You have multiple restaurants.

37:06.999 --> 37:09.999
It's not like we have to
work at the same one.

37:09.999 --> 37:13.999
- No, I don't think it's gonna
work out like that at all.

37:13.999 --> 37:15.999
We don't encourage

37:15.999 --> 37:16.999
inter-company dating.

37:16.999 --> 37:17.999
Do you understand?

37:17.999 --> 37:18.999
- No, I understand.

37:18.999 --> 37:20.999
- I feel like Lisa's kind of

37:20.999 --> 37:22.999
holding Brittany
to, like, an unfair standard

37:22.999 --> 37:23.999
because she's dating me.

37:23.999 --> 37:26.999
I just think she was just

37:26.999 --> 37:28.999
at a loss
before she even started.

37:28.999 --> 37:29.999
That's not fair.

37:29.999 --> 37:31.999
- So, I've got things to do.

37:31.999 --> 37:32.999
- Okay.
- Thank you.

37:32.999 --> 37:34.999
Good luck with that one.

37:54.999 --> 37:55.999
- Want me to chop this up?

37:55.999 --> 37:56.999
- Yes, please.

37:57.999 --> 37:59.999
Can you grab me a Capri-Sun?

37:59.999 --> 38:00.999
- Yeah.

38:01.999 --> 38:02.999
Ooh.

38:02.999 --> 38:05.999
- Fancy.

38:05.999 --> 38:07.999
I can't wait until
we have, like,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.999
a house with, like,
a dining room,

38:10.999 --> 38:12.999
and a dining room table,

38:12.999 --> 38:15.999
and we can eat
like normal humans.

38:15.999 --> 38:17.999
#GOALS.

38:17.999 --> 38:20.999
Good to have you
back home.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.999
- It's good to be home.

38:22.999 --> 38:25.999
- What'd you do the whole time
you were back home?

38:25.999 --> 38:27.999
- I spent a lot of time,
you know, with my family,

38:27.999 --> 38:29.999
and my parents, especially.

38:29.999 --> 38:30.999
It's being with the people

38:30.999 --> 38:31.999
that like, I feel
most comfortable.

38:31.999 --> 38:33.999
- But that should be me.

38:33.999 --> 38:35.999
- Well, not when
we're going through

38:35.999 --> 38:36.999
what we're going through.

38:36.999 --> 38:37.999
So what, I stay here?

38:37.999 --> 38:38.999
Where do I go,
move in with Tom and Tom?

38:38.999 --> 38:39.999
Or like, whatever?

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
- No, we work through it.

38:42.999 --> 38:43.999
- You don't understand.

38:43.999 --> 38:45.999
You're not easy
to work through things with

38:45.999 --> 38:47.999
because I can't be honest

38:47.999 --> 38:49.999
all the time
'cause you're intimidating.

38:49.999 --> 38:51.000
'Cause I can't get a word in
and stuff like that.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.999
That's why I left.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.999
- I'm trying to get better
about that.

38:56.999 --> 38:57.999
- I understand that,
but I'm saying--

38:57.999 --> 39:00.999
and I'm trying to get better
about telling you how I feel.

39:00.999 --> 39:02.999
You don't make it--
you know, do whatever it takes

39:02.999 --> 39:05.999
you know, to fix me
but to fix this.

39:05.999 --> 39:07.999
That's all I care about.

39:07.999 --> 39:09.999
The guy who I used to be,

39:09.999 --> 39:12.999
who was taking pills
and drinking too much,

39:12.999 --> 39:14.999
and not--he's gone.

39:14.999 --> 39:15.999
I don't wanna
see him again.

39:15.999 --> 39:17.999
- And it's fine to drink
when it's an occasion,

39:17.999 --> 39:18.999
and we're having fun.

39:18.999 --> 39:22.999
So I'm not being like, "Oh,
you need to be clean and sober,

39:22.999 --> 39:23.999
and never drink again."
It's just--

39:23.999 --> 39:25.999
- Well, the thing--
yeah--

39:25.999 --> 39:27.999
- Find the happy medium,
that's all I'm saying.

39:27.999 --> 39:30.999
I don't think I could
ever be with someone

39:30.999 --> 39:33.999
who's completely sober,

39:33.999 --> 39:36.999
because that's not reality

39:36.999 --> 39:38.999
with the life I lead
with my friends.

39:38.999 --> 39:41.999
What he needs to do is just sip.

39:41.999 --> 39:43.999
You don't have to drink
to get drunk.

39:43.999 --> 39:44.999
Drink to get a good buzz.

39:44.999 --> 39:46.999
We did have an agreement,

39:46.999 --> 39:50.999
and I'm sticking with that.

39:55.999 --> 39:56.999
I don't want you to think

39:56.999 --> 39:58.999
this is because
I don't trust you.

39:58.999 --> 40:00.999
- I know.
I understand.

40:00.999 --> 40:04.999
- If marijuana is positive,
I'll give you a pass.

40:04.999 --> 40:08.999
My goal would be
by our one-year anniversary,

40:08.999 --> 40:11.999
that we're
in a way better place.

40:11.999 --> 40:12.999
- Guess I should go handle this.

40:12.999 --> 40:14.999
- You can finish
your Capri-Sun first.

40:14.999 --> 40:16.999
- Get the juices flowing.

40:16.999 --> 40:17.999
- And that's what I told him,
I said,

40:17.999 --> 40:20.999
"I'm gonna test you
as much as I have to,

40:20.999 --> 40:24.999
until I trust that you're not
taking anything again."

40:24.999 --> 40:26.999
- Gonna drain the lizard.

40:30.999 --> 40:31.999
- Coming up...

40:31.999 --> 40:32.999
- But he doesn't need rehab.

40:32.999 --> 40:34.999
- Do not sweep it
under the rug.

40:34.999 --> 40:35.999
- I'm not going to.
- Pull up that rug...

40:36.000 --> 40:36.999
- Absolutely.
- And clean out

40:37.000 --> 40:39.999
the f***ing cobwebs.

40:54.999 --> 40:55.999
- Hello.
- Hi.

40:55.999 --> 40:59.999
- Eric, can you ask somebody
to bring me a cup of tea?

40:59.999 --> 41:00.999
- Sure.
- Thanks.

41:00.999 --> 41:02.999
So how are you doing?

41:03.999 --> 41:06.999
Better emotionally.

41:06.999 --> 41:08.999
- So where are you at
in your head?

41:08.999 --> 41:11.999
- We had a good breakthrough
conversation

41:11.999 --> 41:15.999
that I think is gonna put him
on the right path.

41:15.999 --> 41:18.000
- But if you've been doing stuff
for eight years,

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
it takes more than
one conversation.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
- Oh, absolutely.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.999
- And he's been duplicitous,

41:22.999 --> 41:24.000
and he's been lying to you.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.999
My point is, you've said that
you have done it on your own,

41:26.999 --> 41:28.999
but I mean, I don't think
life is that simple.

41:28.999 --> 41:30.000
There are a lot of people
as strong as you

41:30.000 --> 41:31.999
that haven't been able
to make addicts quit.

41:31.999 --> 41:35.000
- I know I married
the right person,

41:35.000 --> 41:37.999
and I know
we're gonna get through this.

41:37.999 --> 41:39.999
It's not gonna be easy,

41:39.999 --> 41:40.999
but I'm not a quitter.

41:40.999 --> 41:41.999
- He does need help.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
- He doesn't need rehab.
He--that's--

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
- Well, you say that.
You say that.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.999
- No, I mean, it wasn't like
he was taking 10 or 15 a day.

41:48.999 --> 41:52.000
Some days it was two,
some days it was five.

41:52.999 --> 41:54.999
The most he ever took
in one day, he said was

41:54.999 --> 41:56.999
probably close to ten,
but that was

41:56.999 --> 41:57.999
a long time ago.

41:57.999 --> 41:59.999
- How do you know
he's not lying to you?

41:59.999 --> 42:02.999
- Because I make him
pee in a cup.

42:02.999 --> 42:04.999
I'm just like,
"Hey, um, next time

42:04.999 --> 42:07.999
you have to pee,
go pee in there."

42:07.999 --> 42:08.999
- She's not a nurse.

42:08.999 --> 42:11.999
She's not
an addiction specialist.

42:11.999 --> 42:15.999
It's not normal
to be doing random pee tests

42:15.999 --> 42:17.999
with your husband.

42:17.999 --> 42:20.999
That is not really
the foundation

42:20.999 --> 42:22.999
of a good and happy marriage.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.999
Do not sweep it
under the rug.

42:24.999 --> 42:25.999
- I'm not going to.
- Pull up that rug...

42:25.999 --> 42:26.999
- Absolutely.
- And clean out

42:26.999 --> 42:28.999
the f***ing cobwebs,

42:28.999 --> 42:29.999
and get with it, you know?

42:29.999 --> 42:31.999
You put your foot
up his ass.

42:31.999 --> 42:34.999
- Oh, it's--
it's far up there.

42:34.999 --> 42:35.999
- Okay.

42:37.999 --> 42:39.999
- Next time on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

42:39.999 --> 42:41.999
- Kristen Doute, it's over.

42:41.999 --> 42:42.999
I had fun last night,
you know?

42:42.999 --> 42:43.999
- I did too.

42:43.999 --> 42:45.999
- Don't we have a
no fraternization rule?

42:45.999 --> 42:48.000
- Are you trying to sabotage
Lala and James?

42:48.999 --> 42:49.999
- He's gonna sink his own ship.

42:49.999 --> 42:50.999
I don't have to do anything.

42:50.999 --> 42:52.999
- James has said so much
sh** about you.

42:52.999 --> 42:55.999
He's like, "She's a slut,
she's a whore."

42:55.999 --> 42:56.999
- I'm so f***ing offended.

42:56.999 --> 42:59.000
- You're being a f***ing
basic bitch right now.

42:59.999 --> 43:00.999
- Wow, oh!

43:01.999 --> 43:04.999
- I really don't think
he's gonna f*** up again.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.999
I think he's gonna do
everything in his power

43:06.999 --> 43:09.999
to make me
the happiest woman alive.

43:09.999 --> 43:11.999
- I have milk that has a longer
shelf life than that marriage.

43:11.999 --> 43:12.999
- That is so mean.

43:12.999 --> 43:14.999
