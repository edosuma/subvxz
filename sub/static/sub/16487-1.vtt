00:32.360 --> 00:33.361
<i>Back then,</i>

00:33.800 --> 00:35.290
<i>this is years ago,</i>

00:36.200 --> 00:37.850
<i>I couldn't afford secrets.</i>

00:38.520 --> 00:40.045
<i>I just had chores.</i>

00:41.640 --> 00:43.483
<i>As a child growing up,</i>

00:44.240 --> 00:45.241
<i>we had been rich.</i>

00:46.240 --> 00:47.480
<i>And then, well,</i>

00:48.800 --> 00:50.086
<i>we weren't.</i>

00:51.320 --> 00:53.607
<i>And like most people
during the Depression,</i>

00:54.720 --> 00:59.487
<i>I now lived each day as it came
no longer expecting anything.</i>

01:01.000 --> 01:02.047
<i>Waiting.</i>

01:02.840 --> 01:03.841
<i>For nothing.</i>

01:06.800 --> 01:08.484
<i>And then...</i>

01:08.560 --> 01:10.005
Hello?

01:10.120 --> 01:11.167
<i>My dear,</i>

01:11.200 --> 01:14.124
<i>I'm afraid I must presume
on your good nature.</i> What?

01:14.440 --> 01:16.522
Shhh... Quiet!

01:16.920 --> 01:18.001
Sinus?

01:18.160 --> 01:22.449
<i>Now I would like you to come over, and
I shall expect you this afternoon.</i>

01:22.560 --> 01:24.608
Yes...
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

01:30.760 --> 01:31.966
Did someone die?

01:47.520 --> 01:49.045
I won't be long.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.650
Good morning, Miss Suckley.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.530
<i>I wasn't the first relative
his mother called that day.</i>

02:10.440 --> 02:12.090
<i>Maybe not even the tenth.</i>

02:12.920 --> 02:14.206
<i>But I was around.</i>

02:15.680 --> 02:19.890
<i>His mother said he needed someone
to take his mind off his work.</i>

02:21.680 --> 02:24.763
<i>Why she thought I could
do that, I had no idea.</i>

02:25.760 --> 02:28.570
I suppose he's related
to half of everybody up here?

02:29.160 --> 02:32.369
We're fifth or sixth cousins.
It depends on how you count.

02:32.440 --> 02:36.331
Cigarette?
No, no, I don't.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.286
<i>I figured I'd spend
the afternoon there</i>

02:39.720 --> 02:42.883
<i>and after having thoroughly
bored him to death</i>

02:42.960 --> 02:45.327
<i>go back to my quiet life</i>

02:45.720 --> 02:48.007
<i>taking care of my aunt.</i>

02:48.320 --> 02:49.810
<i>But that's not what happened.</i>

03:00.720 --> 03:03.610
He's not been
feeling well. Sinuses.

03:03.800 --> 03:07.122
It seems to happen every time,
the second he comes home.

03:13.760 --> 03:14.921
Mr. President?

03:27.760 --> 03:31.003
Ah!

03:38.520 --> 03:39.521
Daisy?

03:40.640 --> 03:42.688
What a rare treat.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.728
I hope my mother
didn't force this on you.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.928
She said everyone else was away.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.041
Did she?

03:50.240 --> 03:51.890
She shouldn't have said that.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.485
How nice to see you.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.165
How long has it been?

03:57.520 --> 03:58.931
Oh, years.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.251
At the Dows' wedding,
sir, in Rhinebeck.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.324
Oh, were you there?

04:06.640 --> 04:08.005
Where would you like me to sit?

04:09.560 --> 04:12.404
There's tea. I think
there's still tea.

04:12.840 --> 04:13.841
Will you...

04:22.120 --> 04:25.203
I can do this because
my mother is not here.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.650
She doesn't believe
in sinus medicine.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.209
Do you collect stamps, Daisy?

04:58.520 --> 04:59.931
I don't.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.845
Come and take a look at these.

05:15.640 --> 05:17.722
Oh, shall I...

06:02.240 --> 06:05.164
I suppose you've pretty
much met all of these?

06:06.800 --> 06:07.881
Not all of them.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.810
Not yet.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.127
Jerry, just...

06:15.640 --> 06:17.483
Excuse me,
I should have knocked.

06:24.040 --> 06:26.202
Did I actually write this?

06:26.800 --> 06:30.521
My cross, Daisy,
is that I am too nice.

06:30.720 --> 06:31.721
Hmm?

06:33.120 --> 06:35.202
But we do need the
Senator's vote, don't we?

06:36.280 --> 06:40.330
Why can't politicians
just be honest?

06:48.640 --> 06:49.641
My cousin.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.161
Thank you.

07:06.080 --> 07:09.243
Those are from Africa.

07:10.600 --> 07:15.845
They say that is the highest
waterfall in the world.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.370
Would you like me to go?

07:36.920 --> 07:40.208
No. Please. I wouldn't.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.006
This one's pretty.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.123
I'd like to go there.
Where is that?

07:52.400 --> 07:55.051
To be honest, I'd like to
go just about anywhere.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.609
<i>In Europe there would
certainly be another war.</i>

08:16.960 --> 08:20.601
<i>One we would be dragged into
whether we liked it or not.</i>

08:21.680 --> 08:25.048
<i>Here at home, the country
was still in a depression.</i>

08:25.680 --> 08:27.409
<i>People out of work.</i>

08:27.600 --> 08:29.921
<i>Hungry.
Needing help.</i>

08:32.039 --> 08:34.850
<i>The President spent an awful
lot of time that spring</i>

08:34.919 --> 08:36.445
<i>in Hyde Park on Hudson.</i>

08:36.720 --> 08:40.167
Fellas, would one of you please
tell Mother that this is radio?

08:40.240 --> 08:44.723
<i>He said I helped him forget
the weight of the world.</i>

08:44.800 --> 08:46.802
- That's 30 seconds...
- Look at me.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.043
Right, quiet, quiet
down, everybody. Thank you.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.771
I think that means you, Mother.

08:51.840 --> 08:55.481
<i>His mother said he'd run the
whole country from here if he could.</i>

08:55.840 --> 08:58.810
<i>But he couldn't.
Not with how things were.</i>

09:01.320 --> 09:04.244
<i>Everyone knew someone
who couldn't find a job.</i>

09:06.200 --> 09:07.804
<i>Everyone was scared.</i>

09:07.880 --> 09:11.521
<i>...protect the economic
welfare of all the people in all groups.</i>

09:11.600 --> 09:13.125
<i>I said that if</i>

09:13.640 --> 09:17.804
<i>private enterprise could not
provide jobs this spring,</i>

09:18.840 --> 09:21.889
government would take
up the slack.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.531
We have all learnt the lesson

09:24.640 --> 09:27.644
that government
cannot afford to wait

09:27.840 --> 09:30.969
until it has lost
the power to act.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.604
Therefore I have sent a message

09:34.000 --> 09:36.765
of far-reaching importance
to the Congress...

09:36.840 --> 09:39.650
<i>Everyone was looking to him.</i>

09:43.160 --> 09:45.925
<i>They all wanted
something from him.</i>

09:48.840 --> 09:50.604
<i>The local labor union,</i>

09:50.840 --> 09:53.320
<i>the Hyde Park Chamber
of Commerce,</i>

09:53.560 --> 09:57.007
<i>the German-American
Friendship Band.</i>

10:02.880 --> 10:06.362
<i>And all he wanted was to relax.</i>

10:13.040 --> 10:17.090
<i>Each time he came home
he'd telephone and ask,</i>

10:17.600 --> 10:21.730
<i>"Daisy, where would you
like to go today?"</i>

10:22.320 --> 10:24.322
<i>And I would always answer,</i>

10:24.560 --> 10:25.891
<i>"Anywhere."</i>

10:31.480 --> 10:34.962
<i>His wife, he said,
didn't like to take drives.</i>

10:44.680 --> 10:49.402
<i>I learned the names of birds and
trees I'd seen my whole life.</i>

10:51.120 --> 10:57.401
<i>We drove along country roads, up
hills, through woods, through fields.</i>

10:58.000 --> 11:01.243
<i>We drove down roads
I never knew existed.</i>

11:01.840 --> 11:05.925
<i>Roads, later, I could
never find on my own.</i>

11:13.440 --> 11:17.843
<i>He'd had the car built so it could
be driven with just the hands.</i>

11:17.920 --> 11:20.685
In some ways it's
smoother than a regular car.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.326
Would you like to drive?

11:23.360 --> 11:24.361
No.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.527
<i>I believe I helped him
forget the world.</i>

11:33.120 --> 11:34.281
Let me help.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.565
<i>As if we'd just</i>

11:38.640 --> 11:39.880
<i>run away.</i>

11:44.040 --> 11:46.281
<i>And then, one day...</i>

11:56.600 --> 11:58.204
Where's the police car going?

11:59.480 --> 12:01.721
Oh, they don't always follow.

12:02.680 --> 12:06.401
Sometimes they have to go and catch
a crook or something, I suppose.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.007
We've never been here before.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.445
No, I've been saving this.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.204
I like this song.

14:37.960 --> 14:38.961
Oh.

14:54.720 --> 14:57.849
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I...

14:57.920 --> 15:01.970
I'm the one
who should apologize.

15:08.240 --> 15:13.007
<i>I knew that we were
now not just fifth cousins,</i>

15:14.840 --> 15:17.366
<i>but very good friends.</i>

15:32.880 --> 15:35.008
As soon as I can get away.

15:35.640 --> 15:37.563
<i>That
we are the best of friends.</i>

15:37.640 --> 15:39.290
<i>Time passed.</i>

15:40.320 --> 15:45.884
<i>Time measured now in Franklin's
visits to Hyde Park.</i>

15:48.080 --> 15:49.241
Who was that?

15:51.520 --> 15:53.488
The President wishes to see me.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.804
He is the President.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.249
He wishes to show me
a new stamp.

16:24.680 --> 16:27.126
Where are we going?
I don't know.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.607
I had it built.
It's where I'll retire.

16:45.920 --> 16:48.491
I'll write those detective books
I'm always talking about.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.011
Go take a look.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.771
Go on.

17:12.319 --> 17:14.607
There's a bit of
paint smell still.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.844
It's heaven.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.842
I've been thinking, Daisy...
What?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.684
What have you been thinking?
That I...

18:25.120 --> 18:30.126
I'd like to share with you

18:31.280 --> 18:32.281
this.

18:33.920 --> 18:38.608
When I go away...
You know I have to go away.

18:42.400 --> 18:43.845
Should you ever miss me...

18:46.040 --> 18:48.042
Well...
Do you ever miss me?

18:49.880 --> 18:51.325
I always do.

18:53.880 --> 18:55.211
Always.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.810
A place you can come

18:59.800 --> 19:01.484
and be alone and miss me.

19:04.720 --> 19:07.610
Oh, I'm sorry, so sorry.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.724
Sorry, sorry.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.280
It's all right.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.731
<i>By now,
everyone was used to me.</i>

19:29.600 --> 19:32.001
<i>I was the cousin
who's always visiting.</i>

19:32.920 --> 19:35.526
<i>No one ever even asked me
why that was.</i>

19:35.600 --> 19:37.090
Has he read this?

19:38.160 --> 19:39.366
I believe he has.

19:39.760 --> 19:43.845
"If one could choose, from all
possible British personalities,

19:43.920 --> 19:47.402
the two who might make the
best impression upon Americans,

19:47.600 --> 19:52.970
King George and Queen Elizabeth
would not even make the shortlist."

19:53.400 --> 19:56.165
How dare they talk
about royalty like that!

19:56.240 --> 20:00.325
<i>No King of England had
ever visited America before.</i>

20:00.720 --> 20:04.441
<i>But now he was coming
to Hyde Park on Hudson</i>

20:05.520 --> 20:09.650
<i>and the only quiet place
left to work was outside.</i>

20:09.800 --> 20:11.370
What are those for?
He has a headache.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.767
You do?
It's his sinuses again.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.008
It happens this time every year.
I know that.

20:16.080 --> 20:18.048
You didn't say anything
about having a headache.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.804
He's not going to trouble
you with everything, Missy.

20:19.880 --> 20:20.881
You have enough on your plate.

20:20.960 --> 20:22.325
What does that mean?

20:22.880 --> 20:26.248
It means, Missy, that you
take very good care of me.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.524
It means that you do, too.

20:28.800 --> 20:32.964
Mrs. Roosevelt, we appear
not to have enough plates.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.361
What?

20:34.480 --> 20:36.801
We don't have enough plates.
Someone miscounted.

20:37.160 --> 20:39.083
You're telling me this now?

20:39.160 --> 20:41.481
Madam, Mrs. Astor
has called again.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.965
<i>Franklin had warned us...</i>

20:43.040 --> 20:47.090
Mrs. Astor will have plates.
We will borrow hers.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.766
<i>Today, stay out
of Mother's way.</i>

20:49.840 --> 20:51.330
On second thought,

20:52.560 --> 20:55.643
we shall call her cook.
Certainly.

20:56.600 --> 20:59.331
Mrs. Astor's so rich
she doesn't know what she has.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.367
<i>Franklin's wife, Eleanor.</i>

21:07.720 --> 21:09.961
I'm just doing what I'm told.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.609
Well, so much
for your little secret.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.166
Morning, Mother.

21:26.240 --> 21:27.480
Good morning, Eleanor.

21:30.600 --> 21:35.811
We are not going to
serve the King of England a cocktail!

21:36.200 --> 21:37.565
Mrs. Roosevelt,
you got it all wrong.

21:37.640 --> 21:39.449
You see,
this isn't for the King...

21:39.880 --> 21:42.486
Your mother has now told
me for the tenth time

21:42.560 --> 21:44.688
not to call her Royal
Highness Elizabeth.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.884
She told me that, too. I mean,
please, what century is this?

21:48.160 --> 21:50.527
Daisy?
Daisy?

21:52.440 --> 21:54.442
What? Oh, yes.
She told me the same thing.

21:54.560 --> 21:56.562
I told her who did
she think I was?

21:56.840 --> 21:59.571
Oh, I think she knows.
Daisy, hello?

22:00.160 --> 22:03.846
You're just staring.
I'm not. I wasn't.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.491
What do you want? MISSY: Eleanor's
just brought out fresh coffee.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.085
She was asking
if you'd like any.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.886
You're just staring again.
I'm not.

22:14.560 --> 22:15.971
Missy, leave her alone.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.447
My husband lives for the
adoring eyes of young women.

22:18.560 --> 22:21.245
We know this. Let's change
the subject, shall we?

22:21.360 --> 22:23.010
Oh, don't tell me
you're embarrassed.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.806
That day I'd like to see. I
didn't say I was embarrassed.

22:25.960 --> 22:28.406
Why do we care what a
king or a queen says about us?

22:28.480 --> 22:31.563
Real rosewood.
Still got the smell.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.045
Is that why it cost so much?

22:36.440 --> 22:40.604
Hick called. For this morning's
royal visit she'd been ordered to produce

22:40.680 --> 22:43.206
5,000 children overnight.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.611
What? Why?

22:44.720 --> 22:47.166
As buffers for holding
back the crowds.

22:47.360 --> 22:50.045
No. Well, the Girl
Scouts refused outright.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.167
Oh, good for them.

22:51.320 --> 22:54.961
They said their girls had
taken an awful beating in DC.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.288
Finally, Hick got
some Boy Scouts,

22:57.360 --> 22:59.966
but, of course, when they were
pushed, they pushed right back.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.602
Started something
like ten fistfights.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.167
When she finally got
back to the office,

23:05.760 --> 23:08.331
she kicked off her shoes, opened
the windows and shouted out,

23:08.400 --> 23:10.846
"God damn the King
and Queen!"

23:11.240 --> 23:13.686
Well, we may be saying
the same thing tomorrow.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.650
<i>"Hick" was short
for Lorena Hickok.</i>

23:17.280 --> 23:21.490
<i>One of these friends of Eleanor's
Franklin called "she-men."</i>

23:23.520 --> 23:26.330
<i>People said their marriage
was troubled and unhappy.</i>

23:27.560 --> 23:30.006
<i>That they lived
mostly separate lives.</i>

23:30.440 --> 23:31.885
<i>But I never saw that.</i>

23:32.160 --> 23:34.640
<i>That's not how they seemed
when they were together.</i>

23:37.160 --> 23:39.731
<i>We ended up in the stables.</i>

23:39.800 --> 23:42.121
<i>Our last hope of refuge.</i>

23:43.320 --> 23:46.449
We must remind ourselves that
these kings and queens or whatever

23:46.520 --> 23:48.240
are no better than us.
They are just people.

23:48.320 --> 23:50.926
I read that in your
column, Eleanor.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.210
Are you all right?
You look in pain.

23:56.840 --> 23:59.764
He has a sinus infection... He
gets them this time of year.

23:59.840 --> 24:02.127
Oh, does he?
I didn't know that.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.563
I took an aspirin.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.411
They just left Beacon.

24:07.840 --> 24:10.241
Good. It won't be too long.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.721
Why don't we just
come out and say it?

24:13.040 --> 24:14.804
They're coming here with their hand out.
Remind me.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.562
Hick thinks I should get at least a
month of columns out of this weekend.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.083
Hick says this King
hates his brother.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.525
Now there's a column
right there.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.806
His brother's met with Hitler.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.723
That's good.
That's another column.

24:28.880 --> 24:31.440
And this is the family we're having
in our house for the weekend.

24:31.640 --> 24:35.406
You don't even live here.
I'm staying the night.

24:36.160 --> 24:37.924
At least that's
what I told your mother.

24:38.320 --> 24:39.810
I thought the brother
gave up being king

24:39.880 --> 24:41.882
so he could marry
the woman he loved.

24:42.440 --> 24:45.250
Daisy, have you ever met
a man who would do that?

24:46.200 --> 24:49.170
Hick says she thinks that the
brother has positioned himself

24:49.240 --> 24:50.924
to be the savior
of the monarchy.

24:51.320 --> 24:54.290
Once England's been defeated and the
fascists have taken over, of course.

24:54.560 --> 24:55.925
He's young, Eleanor.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.531
So is she.

24:59.440 --> 25:00.771
They're both young.

25:02.560 --> 25:04.847
So let's just give them a break.
Can we?

25:06.560 --> 25:11.964
<i>And all the while, the King
and Queen were getting closer.</i>

25:15.040 --> 25:18.931
Shouldn't we stop and meet some people?
Wouldn't that be a good idea?

25:19.560 --> 25:21.608
We've just left...
We're almost there.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.722
I don't think there's
another town now until...

25:23.880 --> 25:25.291
It's just a country road now.

25:26.280 --> 25:28.442
Still.
He wants a cigarette.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.805
We don't want to be early.
No, no, we don't.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.450
And I'd like to meet
some Americans.

25:51.760 --> 25:54.650
Doesn't he want to meet you?
He's busy.

25:58.280 --> 26:00.044
I know how important this is.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.808
You're not going to let the side down.
Don't worry.

26:03.960 --> 26:05.530
That's what I keep
telling myself, too.

26:08.480 --> 26:11.290
You started to talk about
the weekend's itinerary.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.241
You will be staying
in the Roosevelt house, sir.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.169
In fact, it's the
President's mother's house

26:16.320 --> 26:18.322
and she will officially
be your hostess.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.289
And where is
the President's house?

26:20.400 --> 26:22.482
This is where he lives,
when he's not in Washington.

26:22.600 --> 26:25.206
With his mother?
He doesn't have a house?

26:25.280 --> 26:27.203
He has a room.
And his wife?

26:28.160 --> 26:30.527
She lives in
another house. Hers.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.124
And he doesn't...

26:33.920 --> 26:38.084
Which she shares with other
women, who make furniture.

26:38.560 --> 26:41.211
I'm sorry? The furniture.
They make it, build it.

26:41.840 --> 26:45.242
They're couples. They're the
sort who like each other.

26:49.600 --> 26:52.604
The Ambassador's wife, after
having visited Hyde Park...

26:52.680 --> 26:54.205
Hyde Park?
Why do they call it that?

26:54.440 --> 26:56.681
Well, Hyde Park's in London.
It's so confusing to me.

26:57.120 --> 26:58.406
I don't know.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.843
Our Ambassador's wife wrote,
and I think you need to hear this.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.131
She wrote,

27:13.720 --> 27:19.443
"it is a dismal house, extremely
badly run, and most uncomfortable."

27:49.960 --> 27:52.566
<i>Half of his cabinet
had been against the visit.</i>

27:53.400 --> 27:54.925
<i>"The country," they said,</i>

27:55.080 --> 27:59.051
<i>"was in no position to take
sides in another European war."</i>

27:59.960 --> 28:02.088
<i>So Franklin invited them here.</i>

28:03.000 --> 28:05.128
<i>Where, out of the spotlight,</i>

28:05.640 --> 28:09.167
<i>we could all relax
and just be ourselves.</i>

28:21.520 --> 28:23.727
So nice of you to come.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.406
Mr. President, nice
of you to invite us.

28:26.480 --> 28:28.323
Forgive me for not getting up.

28:28.400 --> 28:30.562
Mr. President, it is
an honor to be here.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.490
My mother.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.961
How do you do?
Your Majesty.

28:36.880 --> 28:39.201
My wife, Eleanor.
How do you do?

28:39.320 --> 28:40.760
I hope you've
had a pleasant journey.

28:42.480 --> 28:45.484
- I hear we rang bells for you.
- Yes, we were honored.

28:46.160 --> 28:50.131
What a lovely country.
Quite like Oxford.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.130
<i>Looking back,</i>

28:53.720 --> 28:56.485
<i>I now see how important
that day was.</i>

28:56.920 --> 29:00.481
<i>To them. To us. To the world.</i>

29:00.840 --> 29:03.844
<i>And, of course,
as it turned out,</i>

29:04.320 --> 29:05.481
<i>to me.</i>

29:06.120 --> 29:08.327
Oh, what lovely ships.
Mmm.

29:09.120 --> 29:12.408
My son built them
when he was a boy.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.645
How very clever.

29:14.720 --> 29:18.088
Wasn't that clever?
Terribly clever.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.682
He also did the birds

29:23.520 --> 29:24.885
as a boy.

29:29.840 --> 29:32.411
Until the taxidermy smells
made him ill.

29:34.360 --> 29:37.762
He'll tell you about it.
I shall look forward to that.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.564
Come in, please.

30:05.800 --> 30:09.691
I can't tell you how I've
looked forward to this.

30:10.240 --> 30:13.084
My mother has spoken
of nothing else for months.

30:19.560 --> 30:23.360
Hey, Daisy. Mr. Cameron's
with the embassy.

30:23.440 --> 30:24.487
This is Daisy.
Hello.

30:24.560 --> 30:25.891
How do you do?
How do you do?

30:25.960 --> 30:29.487
<i>That day, the President
sent me upstairs on a mission.</i>

30:29.800 --> 30:32.770
<i>To spy behind enemy lines.</i>

30:40.200 --> 30:41.486
Charming.

30:47.160 --> 30:49.049
Oh, look at that view.

30:53.360 --> 30:54.850
You must tell me
about everything.

30:56.560 --> 30:58.085
That's

30:59.280 --> 31:00.520
the field.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.329
We have fields just like that.

31:05.720 --> 31:08.530
Those hills...
Yes.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.406
...lead down to the river.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.968
Oh. Oh, so that's
where they go.

31:18.760 --> 31:20.125
What are you doing?

31:20.480 --> 31:22.562
I came to see
if I could be any help.

31:31.920 --> 31:33.729
Do you mind if
I call you Elizabeth?

31:36.480 --> 31:39.245
No.
No.

31:43.760 --> 31:46.366
So these are the beds
your friends made.

31:46.960 --> 31:48.166
Those are they.

31:53.320 --> 31:54.685
Aren't they lovely?

31:58.920 --> 32:01.287
Is my wife behaving herself?
Yes.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.048
Has my mother calmed down?
She's fine.

32:04.320 --> 32:05.924
It's like a madhouse.

32:06.000 --> 32:11.040
Don't worry. All's
quiet on the upstairs front.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.849
He's definitely younger
than I'd imagined.

32:21.280 --> 32:24.124
For a king, you know...
Is he?

32:25.360 --> 32:28.364
They both seem nervous.
That surprised me.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.401
Without some help
from us, Daisy,

32:31.840 --> 32:35.049
there soon might not be
an England to be king of.

32:36.240 --> 32:37.651
So I'd be nervous, too.

32:39.080 --> 32:40.570
That's why they're here.

32:42.240 --> 32:44.208
Ah... Damn it! Damn it!

32:45.800 --> 32:48.531
Let me do it.
Let me do it.

32:51.120 --> 32:54.567
They seem like very nice people.
I smell like martini.

32:56.680 --> 32:59.160
Later tonight, after the
dinner and all that is over,

32:59.600 --> 33:01.602
what do you say
you and I get out of here?

33:02.000 --> 33:03.411
Go someplace quiet.

33:05.080 --> 33:06.320
I think I'll need that.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.084
Well, I think I'm free.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.448
It's going
to be a big, big success.

33:38.760 --> 33:39.886
Oh, it's you.

33:39.960 --> 33:42.122
We share a bath.
So I was told.

33:42.240 --> 33:44.481
So we don't have to go
through the... Yes.

33:45.560 --> 33:49.007
What were you looking at?
These prints.

33:51.360 --> 33:55.081
I just told the President's
mother how humorous I found them.

33:55.600 --> 33:58.126
What are they of?
British soldiers.

33:58.960 --> 34:02.362
The 1812 War.
Cartoons, actually.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.046
Mocking them.

34:04.800 --> 34:05.801
Us.

34:08.719 --> 34:10.051
They put you in a room with...

34:10.120 --> 34:11.770
The mother tried to apologize.

34:11.840 --> 34:13.922
I told her I found them funny.

34:16.120 --> 34:19.522
She said she tried to remove
them, but her son insisted.

34:22.639 --> 34:24.520
Why would he do that?
What was he trying to say?

34:25.199 --> 34:27.202
I don't know.

34:32.360 --> 34:34.681
I don't know.

34:36.600 --> 34:40.446
He knows it's important.
He knows why we're here.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.002
May I have a drink, too?
Of course.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.245
How many have you had?

34:51.159 --> 34:53.128
The mother just left.

34:57.360 --> 34:58.361
Cheers.

34:59.240 --> 35:00.890
She apologized for everything.

35:01.440 --> 35:03.727
For Eleanor, mostly.

35:04.160 --> 35:06.561
And for the hot dogs.

35:08.120 --> 35:09.406
Hotdogs?
What are you talking about?

35:09.520 --> 35:11.887
It appears that at the picnic tomorrow...
There's a picnic tomorrow?

35:11.960 --> 35:13.610
In our honor.
You hate picnics.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.808
At the picnic, the President's
wife has organized

35:15.880 --> 35:19.089
that hot dogs be served
as our main dish.

35:19.720 --> 35:22.883
I gather she has even publicized
this in the column she writes.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.245
Are they trying
to make fun of us?

35:35.480 --> 35:37.482
I don't know.

35:41.280 --> 35:42.566
What do you think?

35:48.880 --> 35:52.089
You're not going to tell
Mother, are you, Mary?

35:52.720 --> 35:53.926
Nota soul, sir.

35:56.720 --> 36:00.930
<i>Mary, we all knew,
was one of Mother's spies.</i>

36:01.960 --> 36:04.042
<i>Mother had her spies, too.</i>

36:06.080 --> 36:07.491
<i>These are revolting.</i>

36:07.760 --> 36:09.603
They make our seamen
look like monkeys.

36:10.240 --> 36:11.890
I can't believe he thought
these would make you laugh.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.930
I laughed. They're
trying to make us seem

36:15.720 --> 36:17.165
common.

36:18.360 --> 36:21.807
Your brother would never have stood for this.
I'm sorry, but he wouldn't.

36:22.120 --> 36:27.365
I think if
we just ignore these...

36:27.440 --> 36:29.044
Oh, please, stop stuttering!

36:33.160 --> 36:34.207
I'm sorry.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.730
I'm very sorry.
I didn't mean it, Bertie.

36:41.000 --> 36:45.642
I think I'm getting a headache, my face feels hot.
I'm so sorry, I shouldn't...

36:46.120 --> 36:48.930
I didn't mean...
I am not my brother.

36:50.320 --> 36:53.449
Thank God for that. And you are
not the Duchess of Windsor.

36:54.640 --> 36:56.210
You're better than that.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.924
I just hate to see you...

37:04.560 --> 37:05.641
See me...

37:06.760 --> 37:07.841
Laughed at.

37:13.600 --> 37:17.605
<i>Mother, who had</i> a <i>sixth
sense for sniffing out alcohol,</i>

37:17.800 --> 37:19.245
<i>was on the warpath.</i>

37:20.280 --> 37:23.045
<i>Mother's father
had been a nasty drunk.</i>

37:23.160 --> 37:25.766
Is he coming down? What
is that doing in here?

37:25.840 --> 37:27.808
Leave it, Mother.
I thought we had agreed.

37:27.880 --> 37:30.247
That's not true.
We are not going to serve

37:30.320 --> 37:33.688
the King and Queen of England...
Damn it, I said leave it!

37:33.800 --> 37:35.040
Close the door, Daisy.

37:35.080 --> 37:36.969
What's happening?
Why are you shouting?

37:37.040 --> 37:39.691
I am not shouting.
Close the door, Daisy.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.888
Should I stay?
Just close it.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.004
What is going on? He has
brought out the drinks tray, Eleanor.

37:45.080 --> 37:47.048
- Franklin, you promised.
- As I told Mother,

37:47.160 --> 37:50.164
that's not true.
Maybe after dinner!

37:50.280 --> 37:53.124
- Stop shouting, Mother. We have guests.
- Eleanor.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.441
I know we have guests
and I know who they are

37:55.520 --> 37:58.364
and my son is not going
to serve them cocktails!

37:58.440 --> 38:01.011
They are my guests.
This is my house.

38:01.080 --> 38:02.525
Yes, and you're the one
who wanted us to live here.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.801
- Please, Eleanor. Don't revisit that.
- Take the tray.

38:04.840 --> 38:06.888
It's true, isn't it?
No.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.047
Yes!

38:08.560 --> 38:11.689
I'm the President! ELEANOR:
Oh, just stop it. Stop this.

38:11.760 --> 38:14.127
God almighty. You're
behaving like a child.

38:16.360 --> 38:19.762
I have the program
for tomorrow's event.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.929
Is this for the hot dog picnic?

38:22.160 --> 38:24.686
There will be
entertainment as well.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.685
Perhaps I shall be surprised.
Indians.

38:28.720 --> 38:29.767
No.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.530
"Ish-ti-opi."

38:32.840 --> 38:36.401
What? He's called here,
"The Indian Baritone."

38:37.280 --> 38:38.930
So he's going to sing.

38:39.760 --> 38:42.491
There's "Princess Te Ata."

38:43.400 --> 38:47.371
She will perform
"The Indian Corn Ceremony."

38:47.440 --> 38:48.441
Oh, God.

38:48.520 --> 38:52.206
"Accompanied by Kurkus
Pahitu on the tom-tom."

38:52.960 --> 38:55.088
There's our incentive
not to be hungover.

38:56.520 --> 38:59.091
The tom-tom, hot dogs,

38:59.960 --> 39:02.964
cartoons depicting our British
naval officers as monkeys.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.088
Come in.

39:08.440 --> 39:11.284
The President is waiting to see
you in his study, Your Majesty.

39:11.680 --> 39:14.126
He said it was time for
children's hour.

39:17.080 --> 39:19.765
Drinks.
And the Queen?

39:20.800 --> 39:23.246
She's been allowed
more time to relax.

39:28.840 --> 39:30.126
Here we go.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.086
Good luck.

40:00.240 --> 40:04.370
Sir, my mother does not
approve of cocktails.

40:04.920 --> 40:07.685
And thinks you might
rather have a cup of tea?

40:09.440 --> 40:13.240
My mother would
have said the same thing.

40:14.240 --> 40:16.891
Actually I prefer a...

40:19.760 --> 40:22.491
A cocktail.

40:24.680 --> 40:26.682
A man after my own heart.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.000
Mmm-mmm.

40:40.680 --> 40:43.968
So she said, "I'm so pleased
to meet you, Mr. President,"

40:44.040 --> 40:45.804
"I've only met
three Americans."

40:46.640 --> 40:51.202
"Joe Kennedy, J.P. Morgan
and Fred Astaire."

40:51.880 --> 40:54.451
"Thank God," I said,
"you met Mr. Astaire

40:54.520 --> 40:57.046
or what would your impression
be of the rest of us?"

41:22.240 --> 41:23.366
Hello.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.846
Good evening, Your Majesty.
Good evening.

41:27.160 --> 41:29.686
Mr. and Mrs. Elmer Nichols.
Your Majesty.

41:29.760 --> 41:32.411
Lovely to meet you.
Your Majesty.

41:32.920 --> 41:35.526
Mother, of course, you know.
Welcome, Your Highness.

41:35.600 --> 41:36.840
Thank you so much.

42:17.320 --> 42:18.810
Mrs. Roosevelt...

42:20.320 --> 42:21.970
Mrs. Roosevelt, may...

42:24.280 --> 42:27.568
Mrs. Roosevelt...
I would love to, Your Majesty.

42:33.640 --> 42:35.688
We could have sold tickets
for this dinner

42:35.760 --> 42:37.649
and made ourselves
a pile of money.

42:38.960 --> 42:40.086
Paid for your trip.

42:44.920 --> 42:46.445
<i>The moon was coming up.</i>

42:47.080 --> 42:49.686
<i>There was a warm,
summer breeze.</i>

42:50.160 --> 42:53.130
<i>It was just perfect.</i>

42:54.320 --> 42:57.005
<i>A perfect summer night.</i>

43:03.600 --> 43:05.762
To His Majesty, the King.

43:06.440 --> 43:11.401
<i>Inside, everyone was on
their very best behavior.</i>

43:11.600 --> 43:13.841
His Majesty the King.

43:17.680 --> 43:20.684
And to Her Majesty, the Queen.

43:24.360 --> 43:26.240
Actually, normally,
we wouldn't toast the Queen.

43:27.200 --> 43:28.406
What is that for?

43:28.520 --> 43:32.161
We've been told the Queen is served
exactly 30 seconds after the King.

43:37.240 --> 43:40.881
<i>A tray, with
Mrs. Astor's 24 plates,</i>

43:40.960 --> 43:44.726
<i>collapsed, for no reason,
just before the soup.</i>

43:44.880 --> 43:46.325
What happened?

43:46.600 --> 43:48.887
I don't know, ma'am.
No one touched it.

43:49.360 --> 43:53.968
I suppose an angel just passed,

43:54.040 --> 43:56.611
a very clumsy one.

44:02.880 --> 44:04.484
That was very good.

44:09.160 --> 44:12.482
<i>But some people
had other explanations.</i>

44:12.920 --> 44:15.400
- It's the full moon.
- Do you think it's full?

44:15.480 --> 44:19.087
- I give it one more day.
- I think it's full.

44:19.440 --> 44:20.487
Daisy?

44:21.280 --> 44:23.760
Oh, hello, Zack.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.844
Do you think it's full tonight?
What?

44:29.840 --> 44:33.925
Oh, yes, that moon
certainly is full.

44:34.480 --> 44:36.801
She says I'm right.
I don't know for sure.

44:36.880 --> 44:40.362
I could be wrong. It's just
such an important night.

44:40.600 --> 44:42.443
Is it? I don't know.

44:42.880 --> 44:44.530
I mean, what's one king
more or less?

44:44.840 --> 44:46.922
He still has to put his
pants on one leg at a time.

44:47.520 --> 44:49.602
Did you curtsey
for the Queen, Daisy?

44:49.680 --> 44:52.206
I certainly did
and I think I did it right.

44:52.480 --> 44:53.970
I didn't fall down.

44:54.640 --> 44:56.642
How come you're not inside
there, Daisy?

44:57.560 --> 44:59.164
I'm glad to see
you working, Barry.

45:00.040 --> 45:03.601
It's just one night. Well,
at least it's something.

45:05.120 --> 45:08.806
Hey, fellas. Okay, Mr. Friendly.
All right.

45:09.320 --> 45:11.004
Can I take
some home for my dog?

45:11.120 --> 45:13.043
- Your dog, huh?
- He doesn't have a dog.

45:13.120 --> 45:14.360
Hey, listen.

45:14.480 --> 45:17.000
Touch me there again, you're gonna
be wearing it, not eating it.

45:17.360 --> 45:20.091
Ah!

45:23.360 --> 45:25.203
Number two.

45:31.080 --> 45:32.081
Shoot!

45:33.320 --> 45:36.722
Those damn horses.
It's not the horses' fault.

45:36.920 --> 45:40.003
I know, I know, you like them.
I've been looking for you.

45:40.080 --> 45:41.969
Do you need a handkerchief?
Come here...

45:44.720 --> 45:46.131
We saw you out here.

45:46.760 --> 45:47.761
We?

45:47.840 --> 45:50.446
Franklin's asked me to tell
you that you can go home.

45:50.800 --> 45:54.327
He thinks that he's going to be
occupied with the King all evening now.

45:56.200 --> 45:57.406
Of course he will.

46:14.560 --> 46:16.688
<i>No one wanted to go
to bed that night.</i>

46:17.720 --> 46:21.486
<i>Finally, Franklin had to instruct
the band to stop playing.</i>

46:24.520 --> 46:28.969
<i>He wished to spend time
with the King on his own.</i>

46:29.040 --> 46:32.203
Let's go into my study.
It'll be quiet in there.

46:33.040 --> 46:37.204
Unless you need to...
No, no.

46:39.920 --> 46:41.570
Would you mind pushing?

46:42.360 --> 46:43.930
Certainly.

46:47.200 --> 46:49.567
Has Her Majesty gone to bed?
She has.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.083
And your wife?

46:53.880 --> 46:57.043
Who knows?
I'm sure.

46:57.720 --> 47:00.690
Would you mind closing the door?
Of course not.

47:05.440 --> 47:08.205
Cheers!
Cheers!

47:19.800 --> 47:24.442
Do you collect stamps?
I did, I have.

47:24.600 --> 47:27.649
I understand you are
a serious stamp collector.

47:27.720 --> 47:30.929
Perhaps you would show me...
You can't be interested.

47:31.040 --> 47:34.442
But I am.
Do not protest.

47:42.960 --> 47:46.282
When I was a young man, before
my marriage, of course,

47:47.120 --> 47:49.248
I found that
showing one's stamps

47:49.320 --> 47:52.449
was a very helpful way to get
a young woman's attention.

47:52.960 --> 47:53.961
Was it?

47:55.560 --> 47:57.927
But I suppose if
your father's the King,

47:58.560 --> 48:00.688
who needs stamps?

48:04.760 --> 48:07.969
The Queen is certainly
a lovely woman.

48:09.080 --> 48:11.447
As is the First Lady.

48:11.800 --> 48:15.646
She's a strong person.

48:17.760 --> 48:21.651
Some days you don't even feel
like getting out of bed.

48:24.080 --> 48:28.005
But then women like these, they
won't let you do that, will they?

48:29.240 --> 48:30.241
No.

48:30.800 --> 48:32.165
What do you do to be alone?

48:34.000 --> 48:37.721
You need to give them a
reason not to bother you.

48:39.160 --> 48:41.891
You can figure things out in
the quiet of your own mind.

48:44.320 --> 48:48.609
I open up my stamp book and
everyone knows not to bother me.

48:56.920 --> 49:01.562
You were wonderful tonight,
young man.

49:03.240 --> 49:05.766
What do you mean?
Just what I said.

49:05.880 --> 49:09.327
You were graceful,
you were confident.

49:10.520 --> 49:15.208
You're going to be
a very fine king.

49:16.360 --> 49:19.728
I don't know what to say. Your
father would be very proud.

49:20.040 --> 49:21.724
I'm not so certain about that.

49:24.200 --> 49:25.690
If I were your father,

49:29.920 --> 49:31.570
I'd be proud.

49:34.240 --> 49:36.527
The Queen, she's...

49:36.600 --> 49:40.969
She worries so much.

49:41.400 --> 49:42.765
It's been hard for her.

49:44.040 --> 49:46.088
Women worry.

49:47.320 --> 49:50.642
I just stop listening
to her sometimes.

49:50.960 --> 49:52.041
Please forget I said that.

49:56.240 --> 49:57.685
Forgotten.

49:57.840 --> 50:02.801
I... They've asked me to
say some things.

50:08.760 --> 50:11.331
"Such a war

50:12.080 --> 50:15.448
as we now
contemplate..."

50:16.120 --> 50:19.442
"The... The carnage..."

50:24.600 --> 50:25.601
Think of Spain.

50:26.360 --> 50:29.807
Children bombed.

50:31.440 --> 50:33.807
That is what we can expect.

50:33.920 --> 50:36.571
It will be horrific.

50:36.960 --> 50:41.363
And yet we know that
some of your countrymen

50:41.440 --> 50:46.002
wish my country ill.

50:46.280 --> 50:49.921
And want us to fail.
And want me to...

50:50.400 --> 50:52.607
To fail with you.

50:52.720 --> 50:54.085
This goddamn stutter.

50:59.600 --> 51:00.761
What stutter?

51:04.800 --> 51:07.451
This goddamn polio.

51:18.800 --> 51:22.407
Sometimes I think
they deserve better than me.

51:23.680 --> 51:26.763
My subjects.

51:27.240 --> 51:28.651
I'm sorry. I don't know why
I'm saying this to you.

51:28.720 --> 51:32.327
I'm supposed to be trying
to convince you to help us.

51:32.800 --> 51:36.646
Let me confess
something to you now.

51:38.280 --> 51:41.489
As you have been
so honest with me.

51:46.680 --> 51:51.208
No one ever mentions the fact
that I can't use my legs.

51:53.680 --> 51:55.569
It's never referred to.

51:56.680 --> 51:58.091
Not by anyone.

51:58.880 --> 52:03.568
And I used to think it was because
they were embarrassed about it.

52:06.200 --> 52:09.010
But now I think it's because

52:09.080 --> 52:11.367
it's not what they want to see.

52:14.200 --> 52:16.646
Of course, you and I,

52:16.720 --> 52:21.044
we think they see
everything that we are.

52:22.440 --> 52:25.125
All our flaws.

52:25.840 --> 52:27.922
Our transgressions,
our failures.

52:30.600 --> 52:34.889
But that's not what they're looking
to find when they look to us.

52:35.560 --> 52:37.562
And God help us
if that ever changes.

52:38.640 --> 52:42.008
Can you imagine
the disappointment

52:42.080 --> 52:44.367
when they find out
what we really are?

52:47.240 --> 52:48.366
Smoke?

52:52.960 --> 52:53.961
Thank you.

53:01.280 --> 53:04.921
They didn't want me
as their king.

53:10.200 --> 53:12.441
I didn't know they voted
for that in England.

53:30.840 --> 53:32.444
I'm thinking

53:34.800 --> 53:35.801
another drink.

53:36.240 --> 53:37.241
Oh.

53:38.120 --> 53:39.121
Right.

53:54.440 --> 53:56.920
<i>Was I the only one
who couldn't sleep that night?</i>

53:57.960 --> 53:59.405
<i>Was it the moon?</i>

54:05.520 --> 54:07.409
<i>How I longed for him.</i>

54:36.000 --> 54:37.520
- Good night.
- I'll wake you up.

54:42.440 --> 54:44.522
Oh, I beg your pardon.

54:45.360 --> 54:48.682
Sir. I mean...
Please...

54:49.440 --> 54:52.091
Your Highness...
Your Majesty.

54:52.360 --> 54:53.725
Good night.

55:19.520 --> 55:21.488
You're still awake?
Mmm.

55:23.000 --> 55:27.050
I think I'll go to sleep.
It's late.

55:27.600 --> 55:29.250
Why are you smiling?
Are you drunk?

55:29.600 --> 55:35.687
No. He's a very funny man.
Some wonderful stories.

55:37.080 --> 55:39.686
Like what?
I couldn't tell you.

55:39.760 --> 55:42.127
They're not meant for women.
They sound very funny.

55:42.720 --> 55:44.370
Oh, he liked my stories, too.

55:44.560 --> 55:46.050
What stories?

55:46.920 --> 55:50.720
I told him about
the coronation.

55:51.200 --> 55:53.646
About getting the crown
the wrong way round.

55:54.280 --> 55:56.328
And standing on my robe
so I couldn't move.

55:56.440 --> 55:58.560
You shouldn't have told him that.
Why not? He laughed.

55:58.640 --> 56:00.529
We don't make fun of ourselves.
That's not true.

56:00.600 --> 56:01.965
Not here. Of course
he liked those stories,

56:02.040 --> 56:03.087
they make us look like fools.

56:03.120 --> 56:06.010
They make us look like people.
You're so naive, Bertie.

56:09.520 --> 56:11.921
He made fun of himself, too.

56:15.200 --> 56:17.362
He said that
at the picnic tomorrow...

56:17.640 --> 56:19.961
God, that picnic.
He said that the Indians,

56:20.400 --> 56:22.289
they were Eleanor's idea.

56:22.760 --> 56:26.082
"One of my wife's
crazy ideas."

56:26.680 --> 56:28.409
His mother's furious about it.

56:28.480 --> 56:30.642
Franklin's just trying to
keep it short.

56:31.960 --> 56:33.561
He talks about his wife
like that to you?

56:34.280 --> 56:35.884
I hope you didn't talk
about me to him.

56:35.960 --> 56:40.124
I didn't. I wouldn't do that.
We didn't talk about you.

56:43.600 --> 56:47.286
I asked him,
without mentioning you,

56:47.640 --> 56:50.883
about these hot dogs.
What's that about?

56:51.840 --> 56:53.126
Do you want to know
what he said?

56:54.040 --> 56:57.840
He said he doesn't
get the fuss.

56:59.560 --> 57:02.040
They're just a good thing
to eat at a picnic.

57:02.800 --> 57:06.691
There's no meaning.
Nothing more.

57:07.080 --> 57:09.367
You didn't say I was concerned.
No.

57:11.000 --> 57:14.368
I'm not sure I believe you.
That's not fair.

57:21.040 --> 57:22.121
Three different women tonight

57:22.200 --> 57:24.521
asked me if I thought there'd
ever be an American queen.

57:25.840 --> 57:27.490
If we'd ever allow it.

57:28.040 --> 57:29.451
That was rude.

57:33.280 --> 57:35.200
Do you have any cigarettes?
I've smoked all mine.

57:35.280 --> 57:37.886
That won't help you sleep.
I know.

57:50.320 --> 57:51.446
Thank you.

57:55.040 --> 57:57.327
Do you have a lighter?
A lighter. Yes, of course.

58:04.680 --> 58:05.806
Thank you.

58:09.720 --> 58:11.245
I never wanted this life.

58:13.400 --> 58:14.561
I know.

58:16.200 --> 58:17.201
It's hard.

58:22.760 --> 58:24.444
Go to bed, I'll be fine.

58:25.320 --> 58:29.609
If there's a war, and
we know there will be,

58:30.640 --> 58:34.770
he believes America
could be persuaded to help.

58:36.080 --> 58:39.801
Did you see some of the people there tonight?
Did you hear their names?

58:39.920 --> 58:42.571
They're from Italy, Germany.
They're Irish, they're Jewish.

58:42.640 --> 58:44.608
They hate us, Bertie. They
want us to fall on our faces.

58:44.720 --> 58:47.041
They want to laugh at us.
I think you're wrong.

58:48.000 --> 58:51.447
I think we just need to be
a little more confident.

58:58.320 --> 59:00.288
I'm not sure I can even sleep.

59:05.960 --> 59:09.806
Finally, he patted me
on the knee and said,

59:10.480 --> 59:13.723
"Young man, it's time
for you to go to bed."

59:15.120 --> 59:17.009
Like a father, I suppose.

59:17.760 --> 59:20.525
He's very happy that I am King.

59:23.320 --> 59:24.446
Good night.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.725
<i>If ever I missed him</i>

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.570
<i>there was a place
he'd built for me to come</i>

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:38.126
<i>and be alone and miss him.</i>

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.804
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:34.051
Tommy? What the hell
are you doing up here?

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.569
You shouldn't be up here now.
Why? Why not?

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:39.081
Can you get that
out of my face, please?

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.888
The President can't be
disturbed right now, Daisy.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.881
I'll take a look.

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:51.364
Daisy, how nice to
see you up here.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.842
Do you want to see
the President?

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.844
Missy, what is it?

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.440
Oh, my God.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.087
Come back. Come back!

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.885
- Daisy!
- Fuck. Fuck, fuck.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.641
Daisy!

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.806
Daisy!

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:34.971
Here!

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.321
Get out of here.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.840
Listen to me, Daisy, he wants to talk to you.
Get out of here.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:41.082
No, no, no!

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.522
He's going home.
He is headed home.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.446
I want you to listen to me
very, very carefully.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.885
What can you say?
Understand?

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.765
Understand?

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.801
Look at me.
Look at me, Daisy.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.161
Understand?

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:07.921
I know you are intimate.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.002
I've known since
the day it happened.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.969
What?
Those things he said.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:15.408
He meant them.
I know that. That hurt.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:18.601
Cigarette?

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.606
I need one.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:40.606
But I've accepted.

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:43.806
Like you will.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.690
I'm a part of his life

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.164
and I accept that you are, too.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.605
I don't accept you.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:56.528
What about Dorothy Schiff?
Do you accept her?

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.249
Why do you think she built
that place at Top Cottage?

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.970
There are other houses on top
of that hill, not just hers.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.530
He asked her to. He asked
her to build a cottage

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.807
so they could live
together when he retired

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.600
while he wrote
those goddamn detective books

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.688
he's always talking about writing.
No, I don't believe it.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.723
I read the letter.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.211
When was that?

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.966
This year.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:34.366
It wasn't Eleanor
who abandoned him.

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.565
She caught him, too.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.451
With you?
No, no.

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.570
This was long ago.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.524
Years and years ago.

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:57.605
Maybe you've met her.
Mrs. Rutherford.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.125
I... I misunderstood.

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.290
Eleanor. I...

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.685
Eleanor's

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.891
realistic.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.201
I don't think I can

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.721
share.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.809
Oh, I think you can.

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.805
You can.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.490
You decide.

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.490
He won't go to bed.

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.448
He's waiting for you.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:30.325
Missy and my mother
both severely criticized me

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.402
for not inviting you
to the dinner tonight.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.203
I want to apologize.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.487
I think I showed you these

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.331
when you first came
to visit me, Daisy.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.005
But you probably
don't remember.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.521
I remember.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.284
Aren't they beautiful?

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.601
Can you see from over there?

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.440
The highest waterfall
in the world.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.321
That's on this stamp.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:35.125
I really don't think you can see
from way over there, Daisy.

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.806
I really don't.

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.644
And that would be terrible,

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:43.960
not to.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.367
That, Daisy, would be...
How do you see me?

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.768
What?
Am I

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.003
to you just stupid?

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.483
No, Daisy.

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:04.842
But I can understand
how you can feel that way.

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:07.890
Am I like

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.241
a whore?

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:14.525
No, you're not like a whore.

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:20.040
Now would you come over
and sit by me?

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:23.170
No, you're not getting off
that easy, you son of a bitch!

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:28.530
<i>But that's not what I said.</i>

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.691
<i>Instead...</i>

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.404
No, I need to go.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:37.529
I'd say I'm sorry,

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.920
but that wouldn't do any good
right now, would it?

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.971
Someone's coming out.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.886
Which one is she?

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.601
The one you think
looks like a governess.

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:08.445
I thought she
was the governess.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:12.327
I understand it's
a very common thing,

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:14.926
men and their
children's governesses.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:18.204
She's not the governess, but
she's obviously his mistress.

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.327
She dresses like a governess.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.765
She's not a governess, Bertie.

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:26.487
Men find... Some men find, I think,
because they're around children

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:28.729
there's something
rather attractive about...

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.569
Why do you keep
talking about governesses?

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.447
Is there something you want to tell me?
No, nothing. Why?

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:43.926
Oh, look over there.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.443
The secretary.
I hadn't seen her before.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.251
And she's his mistress, too.
According to Cameron.

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.362
We don't need Cameron... Cameron
says there's another one.

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.085
Another?
Who's married.

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:56.523
But she's built a cottage
by his, or something.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.006
Another mistress?

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.885
Good thing we changed our minds
about bringing Lilibet with us.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.685
You changed your mind
about bringing Lilibet.

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.489
I never wanted to bring
Lilibet to America.

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.130
Only because
you don't like Americans.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.608
I like Americans,
that's not fair.

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:12.289
I don't like a lot of
Americans, I like some.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.450
Bertie, are you going
to eat a hot dog?

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:24.320
What? At the picnic.
Tomorrow. Today.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.720
Are you? I mean,

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.640
isn't it like having, say, the PM over
and serving him bangers and mash?

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.691
He probably would like...
To a guest!

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.367
I mean, if we did that,

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.488
he'd know we were trying to tell
him something, he'd understand.

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.688
What would he understand?
How we felt about him.

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:40.923
The PM knows how we feel about him, we like him.
As if that mattered.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.002
Oh, you know what I mean!
I wish I did.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.281
Bertie, I don't think your
brother would eat a hot dog.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.004
How would you know that? Because
he'd know what was meant!

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.686
It doesn't mean anything!

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.886
The walls, sir, they are quite thin.
One can hear. We know.

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.611
Everyone in this house
is already awake.

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:04.290
But to answer your question,
Elizabeth, I am going to eat a hot dog.

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:05.964
No, five hot dogs. Ten!

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:09.410
I'm going to shove them in my
mouth, stick two up my nostrils,

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.209
two more in my ears,
and walk around

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.090
so that people can take
pictures of the King of England

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:15.844
with hot dogs
hanging out of his orifices!

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:21.724
Don't ever compare me
to my brother again.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.920
Sir, it's the President.

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:51.211
Has she gone?

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.209
What do you think
she's going to do?

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.607
I don't think she'll
cause you any trouble.

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.249
If that's what you're asking.

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:09.643
Is that what you're asking?

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.686
They'll see us.

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:20.930
Hello and good morning!

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:22.321
Wave.
I am.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:29.930
Hello.

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.009
Hello.
Lovely morning, isn't it?

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:33.485
Sleep well?

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.602
Yes, yes, we did.

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.645
Didn't we?
Yes, we did.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:38.961
Good.

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:40.961
Me, too.

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:47.130
I thought I might have a swim.
Come along?

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:51.451
Uh, gosh. Aswim?

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.407
Daisy, is that you?

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.441
Let me help.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.930
You're up early.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:41.851
I just woke up.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.091
<i>And so,
the day of the picnic began.</i>

01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:00.048
<i>And everyone pretended, as
usual, not to notice anything.</i>

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:03.001
Watch out, watch out. Here
they come, here they come.

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:06.047
They feeding you all right
out here, boys?

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.281
Throwing you the odd bone?

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:09.328
We're eating like kings,
Mr. President.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.364
Well, you have him
to thank for that.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:14.721
All right.

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:21.010
I made them all agree, no
pictures in our bathing suits.

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:22.881
Oh, you don't look so bad.

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.443
Maybe you ought to have your
picture taken like that.

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:27.124
Get the women's vote.

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:30.889
Oh, that's right,
you don't vote for king.

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.000
Are you two comfy back there?

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:18.927
Yes, thank you.

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.320
And here we are.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.445
I won't be driving
with him again.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.361
Honor to meet you.

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.641
It's such an honor.

01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:00.407
Sam, don't eat them all,
I'm hungry.

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:01.925
Whatever you say,
Mr. President.

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.809
Wave.
He means you.

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:08.284
Look, they're filming.

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:12.400
No, no. Wave. Wave.

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:14.449
Wave, wave.

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:15.841
Hi, there.

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:18.606
Hello. Hello.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.331
She's here.

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:37.841
Good for her.

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.805
What are you doing?

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.640
I'm so pleased you came.

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.683
I promised my aunt.

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:56.291
How do you do?
Oh, how do you do?

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:58.641
Mrs. Woodbury Langdon.
So nice to meet you.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:01.963
Fellas, please favor
this handsome fella on my right.

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.601
Tommy, look who's here.

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.086
Daisy, would you
come with me, please?

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.804
Tommy, she has
every right to be here.

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:15.564
He wants her sitting with him.

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:17.091
I'm not doing that.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.249
Who wants her sitting with him?

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:21.125
The President, ma'am.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:22.401
Daisy.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:25.609
Daisy, please,
where are your manners?

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.321
Let's sit up
with the President.

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.129
He just wants her.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.364
Just wants Daisy,
thank you, ma'am.

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.081
Please.

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:45.011
Daisy! What were you
doing way over there?

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:49.250
The special guests are here on the porch.
And you should be here.

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.771
Please sit down, Daisy.

01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:00.201
Please, Daisy.

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.725
How much longer
is this going to last?

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:55.601
Indian Baritone! Thank you so much.
Thank you.

01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.283
Thank you. Come on.

01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:02.250
Franklin, he wasn't finished.

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:04.361
I thought he was.

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:08.050
Thank you. Thank you.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:13.366
Now let's all say thank you to Ish-ti-opi
in Cherokee, which is <i>"chokapi."</i>

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.281
<i>- Chokapi.</i>
- Can we all say that together, boys and girls?

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.322
Come on, if you enjoyed it,
say <i>"chokapi."</i>

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.641
<i>Chokapi.</i>

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:21.643
Thank you, thank you so much.

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:25.843
<i>At last,
after Eleanor's Indians,</i>

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:29.404
<i>the event we had all been
secretly waiting for.</i>

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:34.289
Your Majesty, would
you like a hot dog?

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:51.804
Do you take mustard?

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:56.687
I take whatever you think
I should take with my hot dog.

01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:00.244
Allow us, then, to put on
a bit of mustard for you.

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:05.809
Here. Daisy, would you show
how we put on the mustard?

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:27.406
You're too kind.

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:47.051
Why are they applauding?

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.291
It's all right. Yeah.

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.686
It's fine.

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.770
What's this about?

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:55.446
It's very good. It's good.

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:56.966
<i>And like that,</i>

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:02.970
<i>we felt America and England were back
on the road to being very good friends.</i>

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:08.962
<i>At least, I'm told that's
how some people took it.</i>

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.486
<i>It made me wonder.</i>

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:17.886
<i>Maybe the hot dogs hadn't been
Eleanor's idea after all.</i>

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:22.842
<i>When he left for England
later that day,</i>

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:25.643
<i>the King sent back a telegram</i>

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:29.487
<i>in which he wrote that our
two nations had now forged,</i>

01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:31.324
<i>and these are his words,</i>

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.928
<i>"A special relationship."</i>

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:35.611
It's good.
It's all fine.

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.201
I'll have another!

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:48.724
<i>The next day, he sent a car.</i>

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:52.805
<i>But I said I was too ill
to take a drive.</i>

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:56.050
Tell the President no.
Yes, ma'am.

01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:57.849
<i>I was ill the next day.</i>

01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:00.125
<i>And the next.</i>

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.204
<i>And the day after that.</i>

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:06.164
<i>A week after the Royals'
visit to Hyde Park,</i>

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:09.331
<i>the President finally came
in person to my house.</i>

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:10.851
Good morning.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.450
<i>I had been waiting.</i>

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.369
<i>He drove us
by the plumbing shop</i>

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:36.006
<i>where his mother had
returned the toilet seat</i>

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.889
<i>she had ordered
for the royal visit.</i>

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:39.890
<i>Without paying for it.</i>

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.409
<i>He tried to make me laugh.</i>

01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.770
<i>And he was good at that.</i>

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.082
<i>He was, after all,
a politician.</i>

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:50.924
Mother wants to pay him now.

01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.641
But he says it's really
been good for business.

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:02.602
<i>He hoped I would forgive him.</i>

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.880
<i>But I was damned
if I was going to tell him</i>

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.171
<i>that I already had.</i>

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:16.644
<i>Occasionally now, Missy would come
and fetch me when she felt...</i>

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:20.003
I think he could use
your company tonight.

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:23.841
Let him wait.

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:38.127
<i>When we played cards,
Missy and I were partners.</i>

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.927
<i>We now shared everything.</i>

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:45.444
<i>I learned, as we got to
know each other better,</i>

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.682
<i>of her bouts
with her blackness.</i>

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:50.681
<i>And of her dark days.</i>

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:56.646
<i>When she fell terribly ill,
he paid for everything.</i>

01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:01.841
<i>He even changed his will, giving
her half should she outlive him.</i>

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:05.247
<i>But to the surprise
of nearly everyone,</i>

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.651
<i>he did not visit her once
in the hospital.</i>

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.571
<i>I asked him why.</i>

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:14.125
<i>"It's a terrible
fault of mine," he said.</i>

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:18.491
<i>"I find it too painful
to be around illness."</i>

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:25.006
<i>I grew close not only to Missy,</i>

01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:27.642
<i>but to all of Franklin's boys.</i>

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:31.963
<i>They seemed to accept me,
no questions asked.</i>

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:36.001
<i>And no more promises were made.</i>

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.442
<i>So none could be broken.</i>

01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:58.610
<i>A year passed.</i>

01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:00.970
<i>And then another.</i>

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:02.571
<i>And another.</i>

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:05.884
<i>I watched him grow tired</i>

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.526
<i>and frail</i>

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.245
<i>and ill.</i>

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.367
<i>He tried to hide this
from everyone.</i>

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:16.570
<i>He knew how to do that.</i>

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:20.571
<i>From everyone</i>

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.206
<i>but me.</i>

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:25.686
Mr. President.

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.125
Okay, boys, take it away.

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.210
<i>Everyone still looking to him.</i>

01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:49.768
<i>Still seeing whatever it was
they wanted to see.</i>

01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:08.887
<i>In a time,
not so very long ago,</i>

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:13.405
<i>when the world still
allowed itself secrets,</i>

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:18.890
<i>Franklin Roosevelt</i>

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:21.967
<i>was mine.</i>
