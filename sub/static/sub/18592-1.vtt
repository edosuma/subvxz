doing up so late?

02:17.761 --> 02:19.761
I'm counting
the stars.

02:20.081 --> 02:21.680
Do you really know
all their names?

02:21.681 --> 02:22.681
Yes I do.

02:24.601 --> 02:25.721
How many did
you count ?

02:25.841 --> 02:27.201
A hundred.

02:28.001 --> 02:29.640
There are more
than a hundred.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.040
I know.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.040
Why did
you stop?

02:33.040 --> 02:34.641
A hundred
is enough.

02:34.841 --> 02:39.080
Once you've counted to a hundred,
all the other hundreds are the same.

04:16.240 --> 04:18.000
Take your
clothes off girl.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.041
My name's Nellie and there's not
room in that bath for two of us.

04:23.041 --> 04:25.480
Who says two's
going in it?

04:25.480 --> 04:28.761
I'm surprised you haven't
got a proper bath.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.601
I like a
tin bath.

04:32.321 --> 04:34.200
Take that light
further off.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.800
What are you
frightened of?

04:37.081 --> 04:41.360
Ashamed I might see your underwear?
Or aren't you wearing any?

05:31.480 --> 05:35.040
I'm cold standing here!
I want a bath too!

05:35.040 --> 05:39.960
There's one outside
under the apple tree.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.841
Moonlight, Good
for the complexion

07:48.441 --> 07:49.440
Oh Cissy!

07:54.320 --> 07:56.440
We've been using
your soap.

07:58.961 --> 08:03.121
Hey it's her birthday today,
and I took her out to celebrate.

08:03.160 --> 08:06.681
Why don't you wish her
happy birthday Cissy.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.720
She's as naked

08:08.720 --> 08:11.921
as a new
born babe.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.000
Nothing wrong with
that is there Cissy?

08:14.481 --> 08:16.880
You're not supposed
to be here.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.481
You're supposed to
be playing cards,

08:23.001 --> 08:26.800
backgammon, newmarket and whist,

08:27.001 --> 08:30.521
then 2 in a row ,
3 in a bed, 4 in hand

08:30.521 --> 08:32.679
5 card stud...

08:32.840 --> 08:36.159
along with your friend...

08:37.441 --> 08:38.720
Madgett...

08:40.081 --> 08:44.280
Hey get a towel Cissy
she's drunk too much

08:46.041 --> 08:50.000
If you play the
cards right Cissy

08:51.440 --> 08:56.161
well you can get your clothes
off and come in here too.

09:00.201 --> 09:03.161
I've had a wash

09:03.321 --> 09:06.040
She gave me
one. Nancy...

09:07.680 --> 09:08.841
One...

09:11.480 --> 09:14.200
I've had a wash
already Cissy

09:14.200 --> 09:15.800
Nancy gave
it to me

09:22.161 --> 09:25.760
Nancy gave it to me,
lets play a game...

09:26.681 --> 09:28.041
Three...

11:46.561 --> 11:47.641
Smut

11:53.841 --> 11:56.480
Get up and
answer the phone!

11:59.321 --> 12:02.280
<i>In the game of
dawn card castles,</i>

12:02.400 --> 12:03.961
<i>52 playing cards</i>

12:04.121 --> 12:07.521
<i>are stacked up into a
castle in a draft free space.</i>

12:08.960 --> 12:12.241
<i>The player can determine
the dreams of the next night</i>

12:12.400 --> 12:15.400
<i>if he awakes before
the castle collapses.</i>

12:15.841 --> 12:18.320
<i>Those players who
wish to dream of romance</i>

12:18.320 --> 12:21.361
<i>build their castles
with the 7 of hearts.</i>

13:08.160 --> 13:10.600
He's put a lot of
weight on recently.

13:12.321 --> 13:14.400
You'll wake him and
he'll want to eat.

13:14.640 --> 13:17.560
The only time he stops
eating is when he's asleep.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.840
Is it warm
enough for this?

13:21.881 --> 13:23.760
I phoned Madgett,
he didn't answer.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.601
What did you want
to do that for?

13:26.001 --> 13:27.840
I've just
drowned Jake.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.440
Do all fat men
have little penises?

13:32.240 --> 13:35.680
I don't know mother, I've not
known...what do you mean?

13:35.881 --> 13:37.761
When you first met Hardy
did he have a moustache?

13:37.761 --> 13:39.580
What do you mean you
just drowned Jake ?

13:39.640 --> 13:41.000
I don't like
the beard.

13:41.121 --> 13:44.801
No neither do I, I'm trying to
persuade him to shave it off.

13:44.921 --> 13:45.721
What do you mean
you've just drowned Jake ?

13:47.121 --> 13:49.960
Yes, I need your
help to move her.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.760
- Move who?
- Nancy

13:54.201 --> 13:55.041
Nancy who?

13:55.241 --> 13:56.960
Nancy Gill, she
calls herself Nel.

13:56.960 --> 13:59.240
What has she got to do with it?
Have you drowned her too?

13:59.440 --> 14:02.321
He doesn't smell
very fresh, does he?

14:02.761 --> 14:06.600
He looks pregnant,
I like these creases.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.760
We better phone
Madgett again.

14:11.641 --> 14:13.680
Perhaps he
can help us.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.280
"Us", mother ?

14:24.000 --> 14:28.521
<i>The game "flights of Fancy"

14:56.480 --> 14:57.361
Damn!

15:00.401 --> 15:02.680
What are we going to say
if we meet someone?

15:02.840 --> 15:04.600
It depends
who it is.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.841
"Morning, just taking Nancy home,
she popped round for a bath."

15:12.000 --> 15:13.681
She could lose
some weight.

15:13.841 --> 15:16.200
Everyone seems to
be getting fatter.

15:16.441 --> 15:19.480
Jake must've thought things
were getting better all the time.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.121
I was only 25 when
your father died.

15:24.601 --> 15:26.281
And plump enough.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.800
Look at
her thumbs.

15:31.121 --> 15:34.681
Seamstresses thumbs,
well turned.

15:34.840 --> 15:36.320
Was Jake interested
in thumbs?

15:36.480 --> 15:38.840
Eh not especially
as I remember.

15:50.681 --> 15:52.080
Mother are you
going to sneeze?

15:52.080 --> 15:53.920
No, I can smell
something.

15:56.761 --> 15:58.121
It's Smut.

15:58.121 --> 16:02.600
Oh Madgett must keep him from
using that paint. It makes such a mess.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.761
What's the smell?

16:04.001 --> 16:08.160
It's gunpowder, Smut's been
celebrating our corpse.

16:10.680 --> 16:12.280
Ah! It's
still wet.

16:56.361 --> 16:58.560
<i>Sheep are
especially sensitive</i>

<i>jog the chairs and

17:12.920 --> 17:16.000
Madgett, where the hell do
you keep all these sheep?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.840
Don't you
like sheep?

17:18.521 --> 17:20.721
Shoo them away if
you don't like them.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.680
<i>Bets are taken on
the combined sensitivity</i>

17:25.680 --> 17:28.241

17:28.241 --> 17:32.520
<i>read vertically,
horizontally or diagonally.</i>

17:32.960 --> 17:37.161
<i>Since there are normally
3 tide turns every 24 hours,</i>

17:37.161 --> 17:41.281

<i>Reliable clocks, calendars

accuracy of the sheep's forecast.</i>

17:52.720 --> 17:54.041
Did you
remember?

17:54.041 --> 17:58.000
Yes. Now they are
slightly damaged,

17:58.281 --> 17:59.880
be careful.

18:01.721 --> 18:03.721
Why didn't you answer
the phone earlier Smut?

18:03.721 --> 18:07.321
I never answer the phone
until the cock crows 3 times.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.921
It's nice to see
you both so early.

18:17.761 --> 18:20.001
How's Hardy?

18:21.480 --> 18:22.800
He's alright.

18:23.720 --> 18:25.200
What are
they doing?

18:26.361 --> 18:28.840
They're playing
"Sheep and Tides".

18:28.840 --> 18:31.560
Sheep are much maligned
don't you think?

18:31.560 --> 18:33.961
Smut and I are testing
their intelligence.

18:33.961 --> 18:36.521
It's an Old Testament game.

18:36.521 --> 18:38.080
No it's not.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.600
Isn't it?

18:40.801 --> 18:44.521
Have some heart...
How's Jake?

18:44.561 --> 18:47.120
No thank you...
and Jake's alright.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.721
Mother, that's
not true.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.560
What are you
doing Smut?

18:51.560 --> 18:53.640
I'm counting the
hairs on the dog.

18:53.640 --> 18:56.321
- What ever for?
- To see how many there are.

18:56.387 --> 18:59.041
Madgett, I think you
ought to come and see Jake.

19:02.269 --> 19:03.309
Smut

19:03.520 --> 19:06.721
Go and give Gregory
and Teigan some tea.

19:07.361 --> 19:08.881
What about
the sheep?

19:10.081 --> 19:12.320
They need to be
thirsty to be useful.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.761
Why do I have to
come and see Jake?

19:17.121 --> 19:18.480
Is he dead?

19:19.480 --> 19:21.120
Good lord, how
did you know?

19:22.280 --> 19:23.640
I didn't.

19:24.921 --> 19:26.240
I feel ill.

19:26.561 --> 19:28.560
It's those
mushrooms.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.320
I've got to
lie down.

19:31.320 --> 19:34.841
For God's sake Madgett, why
have you have to feel ill now?

19:35.840 --> 19:39.481
Look I'm going to phone Cissy, tell
her that Nancy needs a visit.

19:39.680 --> 19:42.881
Madgett I've got to
talk to you about Jake.

19:43.239 --> 19:47.321
Oh Cissy, I can't
talk now, I feel ill.

19:48.281 --> 19:51.081
Tell Smut when he comes back
I need some warm milk

19:51.161 --> 19:53.120
and some lemon juice...

19:53.960 --> 19:55.360
and a straw.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.841
<i>In the game of
sheep and tides,</i>

20:03.000 --> 20:06.881
<i>a referee should be appointed
to determine fair-play</i>

20:06.881 --> 20:11.481
<i>distinguishing correct reactions
from other interferences.</i>

20:12.001 --> 20:14.881
<i>On account of their special
relationship with sheep</i>

20:15.121 --> 20:17.320
<i>shepherds are disqualified..</i>

20:19.760 --> 20:20.960
The tides on
the turn now!

20:21.041 --> 20:23.040
No, not yet.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.560
3... 2... 1... now!

20:27.560 --> 20:28.400
No, you fool!

20:28.440 --> 20:29.721
No you
missed it!

20:29.880 --> 20:31.361
You can't go by the book.

20:31.400 --> 20:34.680
You have to watch...
very carefully.

20:39.561 --> 20:40.720
What happened?

20:42.200 --> 20:44.600
I drowned him
in his bath.

20:44.601 --> 20:45.301
Oh God!

20:45.361 --> 20:48.000
Come and see,
it looks natural.

20:49.401 --> 20:53.600
Madgett, you are going to help me,
pull yourself together.

20:54.121 --> 20:55.321
I am?

20:56.480 --> 20:58.399
and what is
in it for me?

20:58.560 --> 21:00.080
Madgett, you're coroner.

21:00.200 --> 21:04.200
For God's sake stop reminding me...
but that's nice.

21:04.841 --> 21:06.280
Try a bit lower.

21:06.440 --> 21:10.200
Shall I leave now? While you two
come to some sort of agreement?

21:10.321 --> 21:11.641
Don't be stupid.

21:11.841 --> 21:14.040
I couldn't find
any lemon juice,

21:14.319 --> 21:16.800
you'll have to do with one
chocolate pudding.

21:17.552 --> 21:21.104
Oh Madgett...oh
come on Madgett

21:21.686 --> 21:22.817
Cissy

21:23.280 --> 21:26.320
I'm in no especial hurry
to assist your crimes.

21:26.520 --> 21:29.321
Madgett, there's a
corpse in my house.

21:29.361 --> 21:31.000
It's only
your husband.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.640
The flies are
settling on him.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.440
Brush them off,
use a newspaper.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.721
Madgett, I want
legal aid, not a fly swat.

21:55.561 --> 21:59.440
<i>A great many things are dying
very violently all the time.</i>

22:02.721 --> 22:05.600
<i>The best days for violent
deaths are Tuesdays</i>

22:05.760 --> 22:07.960
<i>they are the
yellow paint days.</i>

22:08.160 --> 22:11.001
<i>Saturdays are
second best, or worst.</i>

22:11.161 --> 22:13.520
<i>Saturdays are
red paint days.</i>

22:13.680 --> 22:16.120
<i>The Great Death
game is therefore</i>

22:16.120 --> 22:20.321
<i>a contest between red paint
days and yellow paint days.</i>

22:23.760 --> 22:26.480
<i>So far yellow paint
days are winning</i>

22:26.480 --> 22:29.840
<i>by thirty one corpses
to twenty nine.</i>

22:30.760 --> 22:31.840
<i>Whatever the colour,</i>

22:32.081 --> 22:36.121
<i>a violent death is always
celebrated by a firework.</i>

22:41.960 --> 22:43.161
He is dead.

22:44.201 --> 22:45.241
Well done, Madgett !

22:45.560 --> 22:47.161
What did
he die of?

22:48.600 --> 22:50.041
Well....he drowned.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.801
- Did he?
- Of course

22:51.801 --> 22:53.759
Why did
he die?

22:54.240 --> 22:56.160
There's a strong
smell of alcohol.

22:57.721 --> 22:58.760
So there is.

22:59.641 --> 23:00.801
He drowned
in his bath,

23:01.040 --> 23:02.720
due to
excessive drinking?

23:03.080 --> 23:04.240
Unlikely.

23:04.240 --> 23:07.281
Even in the most
disadvantageous circumstances,

23:07.281 --> 23:11.920
human beings have an almost
involuntary desire to stay alive.

23:12.160 --> 23:13.960
What's the
answer then?

23:17.801 --> 23:20.020
- What's the reward?
- Reward?

23:20.021 --> 23:21.021
Yes

23:21.160 --> 23:25.121
What do I get for writing out
a death certificate that says :

23:25.200 --> 23:27.160
"Death caused by drowning

23:27.640 --> 23:30.280
after heart attack due to excessive drinking"?

23:30.481 --> 23:31.721
Madgett I'm appalled!

23:31.920 --> 23:33.000
I see.

23:34.041 --> 23:35.680
What do you
want Madgett?

23:35.990 --> 23:37.237
Well Cissy...

23:37.361 --> 23:38.800
I'd have thought
you'd have guessed.

23:38.841 --> 23:41.080
No, you tell me.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.720
Is this the moment
when we leave the room?

23:43.880 --> 23:47.081
Yes. The second
tub needs emptying.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.801
Well?

24:04.802 --> 24:05.802
Well...

24:07.361 --> 24:09.720
A little bodily comfort
would be good for a start...

24:09.720 --> 24:12.041
Madgett, I am
sixty one.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.961
Aren't I too
old for you?

24:15.961 --> 24:17.960
Were you too
old for him?

24:19.730 --> 24:20.818
Cissy

24:21.280 --> 24:23.641
You've not been unaware
of how I felt about you?

24:23.760 --> 24:25.680
Well it's a bit
soon isn't it?

24:32.340 --> 24:35.521
Smut which are you first?
A ghoul or a mathematician?

24:35.521 --> 24:36.881
Neither I'm
just a clerk.

24:36.881 --> 24:37.721
Modest!

24:38.481 --> 24:40.880
I could wait...
a little while...

24:41.121 --> 24:43.680
I think you'd have to,
to stop tongues wagging.

24:43.840 --> 24:45.761
But not too long.

24:46.481 --> 24:48.401
This is blackmail.

24:48.761 --> 24:49.760
Yes.

24:56.161 --> 25:00.881
<i>If a player in the game of Dead
Man's Catch, drops a skittle</i>

25:01.281 --> 25:04.881
<i>he is obliged to suffer a
succession of handicaps</i>

25:05.281 --> 25:06.160
<i>First</i>

25:06.160 --> 25:08.320
<i>to catch using one hand</i>

25:08.320 --> 25:10.720
<i>then to catch
kneeling on one knee</i>

25:11.561 --> 25:15.760
<i>then on two knees,
and then with one eye closed.</i>

25:17.000 --> 25:21.201
<i>If a player finally drops a
catch with both eyes closed,</i>

25:21.521 --> 25:25.400
<i>then he is out and must take
his place in the winding sheet.</i>

25:30.561 --> 25:32.400
Madgett, what sort
of game is this?

25:33.060 --> 25:34.720
One to be
played with skill.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.760
Some skill!
It's kids game..

25:40.800 --> 25:42.560
That was a lousy
throw Smut.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.600
Stop complaining
and use one hand.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.721
Look Madgett this is no
time for playing games,

25:50.320 --> 25:51.840
What would
everybody think?

25:51.840 --> 25:53.401
Let them think
what they like.

25:54.101 --> 25:55.880
Is Cissy upset?.

25:56.120 --> 25:59.841
Best to keep her mind occupied,
down on one knee , Bellamy.

25:59.841 --> 26:02.120
These are my best trousers!
I came to pay my respects.

26:02.161 --> 26:04.960
Well you can pay your
respects kneeling.

26:06.680 --> 26:09.321
I can't spend all my times
paying games Cissy.

26:09.601 --> 26:11.761
What's your time
worth Hardy?

26:12.560 --> 26:17.040
I was married to Jake for 34 years,
surely you can spare him a few minutes.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.961
Is he going to be buried
or cremated Cissy?

26:20.081 --> 26:21.120
Cremated.

26:21.279 --> 26:23.040
and where are you going
to scatter the ashes?

26:24.480 --> 26:27.841
Don't worry,
I'll find a suitable place for those.

26:28.041 --> 26:29.080
You're hard
hearted.

26:29.200 --> 26:31.760
and you're a lousy catch,
no eyes and no hands!

26:33.080 --> 26:35.241
Into the winding sheet
Hardy, you're dead.

26:35.321 --> 26:37.600
God you're a
little ghoul Smut.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.360
Who is your
father?

26:41.600 --> 26:42.841
No hands
Bellamy.

26:42.841 --> 26:45.361
Alright! You did that
on purpose Smut !

26:45.401 --> 26:48.600
Into the winding sheet, Bellamy.
It's only a game.

26:48.681 --> 26:50.920
The way Madgett plays it you'd
think it meant something

26:51.281 --> 26:52.521
Well of course it does.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.360
It means you're
a lousy catch.

26:54.680 --> 26:57.840
So, Madgett,
what's the verdict?

26:58.600 --> 27:00.321
Accidental
death of course.

27:06.241 --> 27:08.601
Into the winding
sheet Smut !

27:14.680 --> 27:17.120
Into the winding
sheet Madgett !

27:31.761 --> 27:33.681
I've found you
three more stars.

27:33.840 --> 27:38.440
Cygnia Beta, Castor Minor
and Groombridge 35.

27:38.840 --> 27:43.040
There in the North,
between the twins and Ursula Minor,

27:43.161 --> 27:44.840
Over by
Cissy's house.

27:46.441 --> 27:49.401
Why don't you skip out on
the road? There's more room.

27:50.961 --> 27:52.920
Are you circumcised?

27:53.021 --> 27:54.221
What's that?

27:55.000 --> 27:58.521
A piece of your willy is
cut off, it's in the bible.

27:59.761 --> 28:02.560
My mother says, it's
better that way.

28:10.400 --> 28:14.480
These are the photos of Madgett's game
for taking Jake to the funeral parlour.

28:16.840 --> 28:17.840
Who is that?

28:18.160 --> 28:21.040
It's Cissy's boyfriend,
His name is Bellamy.

28:21.600 --> 28:24.121
On his deathbed,
Prime Minister Pitt said :

28:24.320 --> 28:27.160
"I think I could eat one
of Bellamy's pork pies."

28:40.201 --> 28:42.840
When are you going to break away
from that butt and come and live with me.

28:44.120 --> 28:48.241
I'll marry you on
two conditions.

28:48.942 --> 28:50.042
What are they?

28:51.240 --> 28:53.160
That you learn
to swim...

28:54.240 --> 28:55.640
and never,

28:56.280 --> 28:59.880
never, take me
from the front.

29:00.760 --> 29:02.320
I've told
you before.

29:02.520 --> 29:03.840
Why the
hell not?

29:04.041 --> 29:08.400
because I can't stand being lain on
and it gives me claustrophobia.

29:09.400 --> 29:10.641
Besides,

29:11.640 --> 29:13.481
you won't
hurt the baby.

29:13.761 --> 29:15.040
What baby?

29:15.040 --> 29:16.320
That scared you
didn't it?

29:16.321 --> 29:17.321
What baby?

29:17.440 --> 29:22.121
There's no baby you dope, though the way
you go about it I'm constantly surprised.

29:26.400 --> 29:29.721
Fancy a plumber not
being able to swim.

29:30.281 --> 29:31.960
What's water for?

29:31.960 --> 29:33.600
Drinking perhaps?

29:57.320 --> 30:00.721
Alright Cissy, why
did you do it?

30:01.921 --> 30:04.040
Because he was
unfaithful.

30:05.760 --> 30:09.040
He's been unfaithful before,
why did you wait until now?

30:10.000 --> 30:11.232
Because

30:12.560 --> 30:15.760
Because he'd stopped
washing his feet... because...

30:16.361 --> 30:18.440
his nose was
too red...

30:19.321 --> 30:21.600
because he had a
hairy backside...

30:21.800 --> 30:23.040
because...

30:24.200 --> 30:26.641
I didn't kill him,
he drowned.

30:29.440 --> 30:31.120
I drowned him.

30:34.161 --> 30:36.081
- Was it easy?
- Yes

30:45.361 --> 30:46.320
What is it?

30:47.321 --> 30:48.321
What is it?

30:48.322 --> 30:49.622
Oh Smut!

30:50.720 --> 30:52.921
What have
you found?

30:53.800 --> 30:55.680
How old
is Nancy?

30:57.280 --> 30:58.640
25.

30:59.281 --> 31:01.481
Older than me
and bigger tits.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.080
What does
that mean?

31:06.120 --> 31:09.441
It means Jake made
a play for me once.

31:11.039 --> 31:12.707
He what?

31:14.160 --> 31:15.201
and me.

31:21.521 --> 31:23.161
What a dirty
old man.

31:26.161 --> 31:28.080
Why have you
told me now?

31:29.960 --> 31:31.440
It might help.

31:33.441 --> 31:35.041
I didn't
like him.

31:35.161 --> 31:37.560
Is that sufficient
reason to drown him?

31:37.720 --> 31:38.880
Madgett says it is.

31:39.081 --> 31:41.001
That's pretty irresponsible
for a coroner.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.280
Isn't it?

31:43.520 --> 31:47.240
If you ask him nicely he might be
irresponsible enough to help you.

31:55.511 --> 31:57.271
That's Smut

31:57.720 --> 32:00.440
We lose one,
win one.

32:00.441 --> 32:01.441
What?

32:01.560 --> 32:02.280
A husband.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.480
I've got some
news for you.

32:06.680 --> 32:08.400
Bellamy and me...

32:08.801 --> 32:10.201
or is it "I"?

32:10.720 --> 32:14.321
have decided on a date,
the 31st of this month.

32:16.361 --> 32:17.880
It's a Saturday.

32:21.120 --> 32:23.921
Well you don't look
too excited about it.

32:24.401 --> 32:26.040
Madgett will be
pleased for me.

32:26.200 --> 32:28.000
He, least of all.

32:29.241 --> 32:30.081
Moths?

32:33.840 --> 32:36.281
Yes. Look up those.

32:36.920 --> 32:38.841
Elephant Hawk Moth.

32:41.081 --> 32:42.640
I want
a baby.

32:43.280 --> 32:45.120
At nineteen?

32:46.040 --> 32:47.720
Cissy, you are mad.

32:49.760 --> 32:53.401
I thought you wanted to spend
your life swimming, not bearing children.

32:53.561 --> 32:55.640
Bellamy can't
even swim.

32:56.320 --> 33:00.080
- I don't think he can change a lightbulb.
- I know.

33:00.640 --> 33:03.961
Championship women swimmers
always have their sons early.

33:06.760 --> 33:09.721
and how sure are you
that it will be a boy?

33:10.001 --> 33:12.841
Capable women
normally have girls.

33:45.681 --> 33:47.241
What do
you want?

33:48.120 --> 33:49.640
I'm hot.

33:50.640 --> 33:55.201
Is it true it's desirable to be
circumcised in a hot climate?

33:55.401 --> 33:56.760
So they say.

33:58.920 --> 34:01.161
Was Samson
circumcised?

34:02.801 --> 34:04.320
Does it hurt?

34:04.759 --> 34:05.920
I don't remember.

34:06.480 --> 34:08.239
What does
it look like?

34:09.840 --> 34:12.081
Nothing special. Look..

34:15.520 --> 34:16.681
Now go to bed.

34:19.281 --> 34:23.159
Was Delilah circumcised?
Do they circumcise women?

34:24.719 --> 34:27.081
Sort of...
in hot countries.

34:27.241 --> 34:29.341
- It's hot here.
- So it is

34:38.400 --> 34:39.360
Did they do
it to Cissy?

34:41.320 --> 34:43.121
I doubt it
very much.

34:43.719 --> 34:45.001
Was Jake
circumcised?

34:45.161 --> 34:46.319
You better ask Cissy.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.800
Is circumcision
barbaric?

34:49.000 --> 34:51.321
Some say so.
Now go to bed,

34:51.481 --> 34:54.520
and anything unanswered about
man's barbarity to women,

34:54.639 --> 34:57.120
you can ask Cissy in the
morning, she's an authority.

34:58.320 --> 34:59.561
now let
me write.

35:48.401 --> 35:49.720
Sid !

35:50.800 --> 35:55.000
Number 41. It's by the bridge
in Cattermole Road.

36:15.801 --> 36:16.920
What's he doing?

36:18.320 --> 36:21.560
He's counting the bees,
always counting something.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.400
Bees should be told
about a death.

36:24.641 --> 36:27.600
That only applies to blood
relatives doesn't it?.

36:27.760 --> 36:30.320
Isn't she going to
be a blood relative?

36:30.321 --> 36:31.500
Isn't who?

36:32.080 --> 36:34.720
Cissy, Jake's widow.

36:34.921 --> 36:35.721
Gregory!

36:36.280 --> 36:38.120
What makes
you think that??

36:38.240 --> 36:41.679
Isn't that why you signed the
death certificate "heart attack"?

36:41.840 --> 36:44.681
Good lord, Gregory,
what an imagination.

36:45.361 --> 36:48.280
I know. I got it
from my mother.

36:49.201 --> 36:51.000
Mothers have a lot
to answer for.

36:52.600 --> 36:55.641
Oh sorry it's Smut, here
have a newspaper.

36:56.342 --> 36:57.342
Smut

36:57.921 --> 37:00.200
You're late, you're
supposed to be swimming.

37:01.240 --> 37:04.440
Gregory, come and try this new
game with me. You too, Nancy.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.920
I've got to go, you've forgotten
to tell Madgett about...

37:06.920 --> 37:10.000
He doesn't want to know
about them! Silly girl!

37:10.960 --> 37:13.761
Right then Nancy,
see you later.

37:16.840 --> 37:17.880
Mind the sheep!

37:31.081 --> 37:34.760
<i>The game Bees of the Trees
is a variant of Musical Chairs</i>

37:34.760 --> 37:38.241
<i>it is best played with funeral
music and in open air.</i>

37:38.441 --> 37:42.640
<i>The object of the game is to sit on
a vacant chair when the music stops.</i>

37:43.880 --> 37:46.761
<i>If the chair sat on is
previously occupied by bees,</i>

37:46.761 --> 37:50.080
<i>it is permissible to
arrange a professional foul.</i>

38:07.280 --> 38:09.001
Are you
Cissy Colpitt ?

38:09.161 --> 38:10.761
I am but there
are others.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.200
Our name's Bognor.

38:13.201 --> 38:16.001
B.O.G.N.O.R.

38:16.200 --> 38:18.601
I am Jonah and
this is Moses

38:18.761 --> 38:20.440
We're cousins
of the dead man.

38:20.441 --> 38:21.241
What dead man?

38:21.320 --> 38:24.440
Come on don't be stupid.
Jake of course.

38:25.640 --> 38:29.400
Pleased to meet you.
Are you in training too?

38:29.401 --> 38:30.401
Training?

38:30.720 --> 38:31.840
For the
Olympics.

38:31.960 --> 38:33.640
No, are you?

38:33.641 --> 38:34.641
Yes

38:35.201 --> 38:36.881
Well my coach
is over there.

38:37.281 --> 38:40.680
The one in the red beret
trained with Dawn Fraser.

38:41.080 --> 38:43.681
The other one swam with
Esther Williams in Stockholm.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.800
I thought Esther Williams,
was a singer?

38:56.040 --> 38:57.640
Do you know
those two men?

39:00.520 --> 39:03.640
Wait a minute... they do
look vaguely familiar...

39:03.640 --> 39:05.440
They know you.

39:05.441 --> 39:06.441
They do?

39:06.240 --> 39:09.361
They're Jake's cousins,
they're called Moses and Jonah.

39:10.441 --> 39:12.040
The water's
a connection

39:12.040 --> 39:14.920
How much do you think
body hair is appreciably....

39:14.920 --> 39:18.761
...responsible for extra drag
Miss Freilichberg?

39:18.762 --> 39:19.762
Pardon?

39:20.080 --> 39:23.520
Do you think I ought to
shave and not just my legs?

39:23.620 --> 39:25.641
What do you think
I'd look like bald?

39:25.642 --> 39:26.342
What?

39:26.361 --> 39:27.960
Did Bellamy and
you do that??

39:28.080 --> 39:30.560
???swimming??

39:30.761 --> 39:33.921
When I need to impress
I expect support.

39:35.360 --> 39:36.400
Pardon.

39:37.880 --> 39:39.160
The turn...

39:39.320 --> 39:43.041
it is essential that the
muscles of the pelvis

39:43.201 --> 39:46.880
move at 45 degrees at an
angle to the front.

39:48.120 --> 39:50.040
Johnny Weissmullers...

39:50.481 --> 39:53.000
stop that...legs

39:54.322 --> 39:55.584
Oh Smut

39:55.721 --> 39:57.280
Here's your towel.

40:00.400 --> 40:03.520
It's alright, these
have been counted.

40:04.000 --> 40:04.761
Look!

40:08.401 --> 40:12.400
A man that is born of a woman
has but a short time to live...

40:13.240 --> 40:16.041
You know why they built the
crematorium here don't you??

40:17.360 --> 40:19.360
The ground is so water
logged around here..

40:19.360 --> 40:22.520
...that you can't dig a grave
without making a pond..

40:23.401 --> 40:24.720
Ask Sid.

40:25.799 --> 40:29.800
As it is they hold these services at low
tide in case the water puts the fire out! - Cissy!

40:31.720 --> 40:34.080
Here comes the bit
I've never liked..

40:35.080 --> 40:37.520
Bite your lip and start
counting in threes.

40:38.040 --> 40:39.800
3... 6... 9...

40:39.800 --> 40:41.600
12... 15... 18...

40:41.601 --> 40:43.614
21....24....27...

40:43.615 --> 40:46.567
30....33....36....39...

40:46.568 --> 40:49.482
42....45....48...51....

40:49.517 --> 40:51.000
What are
they doing?

40:51.240 --> 40:54.000
They're counting.
They often do it.

40:54.240 --> 40:56.081
Are you the
local coroner?

40:57.321 --> 40:59.000
How come a
six foot man

40:59.200 --> 41:02.040
drowned in a
four foot bath?

41:02.801 --> 41:04.321
He died of a
heart attack.

41:04.480 --> 41:07.680
A bit inconvenient to have a
heart attack in a bath isn't it?.

41:07.720 --> 41:10.481
It's a bit inconvenient to
have a heart attack anywhere.

41:10.481 --> 41:14.521
What would you say if we said
we don't agree with your verdict?

41:14.840 --> 41:18.120
I'd say you'd better find me
some evidence to the contrary.

41:18.520 --> 41:22.281
How's about "Why were there
two baths?", eh Madgett?

41:37.521 --> 41:40.880
I had a sort of complaint
recently from Nancy..

41:41.360 --> 41:46.121
She came to me to complain of
erm...red paint on her leg

41:46.841 --> 41:48.920
lost shoes and....

41:49.120 --> 41:52.800
some other I gather rather
embarrassing missing article.

41:53.161 --> 41:55.081
- Her knickers.
- Really?

41:55.721 --> 41:57.400
How do you
know that??

41:57.560 --> 42:00.720
Because she paid me to go into
your kitchen and look for them.

42:00.721 --> 42:01.721
She what?

42:01.921 --> 42:04.400
Well she used to be my
Sunday School teacher.

42:04.559 --> 42:07.281
She taught me the ten
commandments - not to lie...

42:07.440 --> 42:08.880
Not to commit adultery...

42:08.881 --> 42:09.881
Shut up Cissy

42:10.001 --> 42:11.560
and I found them
under your sink,

42:11.761 --> 42:14.360
put them in my pocket and
told her they weren't there.

42:14.480 --> 42:16.960
Which was true because
they were in my pocket.

42:17.120 --> 42:19.881
and here they are.

42:20.080 --> 42:22.360
They would of cost another 50 pence.

42:22.520 --> 42:25.361
That shows great
presence of mind.

42:25.560 --> 42:27.281
and a taste
for business.

42:28.160 --> 42:30.000
Well that
settles it then.

42:30.160 --> 42:33.400
If I go down you all
go down with me.

42:38.680 --> 42:40.280
Look who's there.

42:40.560 --> 42:41.800
Nancy.

42:42.641 --> 42:45.040
and the two swimmers
from the baths.

42:45.481 --> 42:47.040
and Bellamy.

42:47.680 --> 42:49.680
Perhaps there's
a conspiracy.

42:50.960 --> 42:53.280
A water tower conspiracy.

42:53.841 --> 42:56.720
Set to accuse you,
Cissy, of drowning.

42:56.880 --> 42:57.960
Rubbish!

43:15.520 --> 43:19.600
<i>The object of hangman's
cricket is for each competitor</i>

43:19.719 --> 43:22.400
<i>to retain his
alloted nine lives</i>

43:22.441 --> 43:25.920
<i>by scoring runs
with a cat or bat,</i>

43:26.401 --> 43:30.080
<i>defending his lower leg from
being struck by the ball.</i>

43:30.840 --> 43:33.521
<i>There is no limit to
the number of players</i>

43:33.521 --> 43:38.120
<i>as long as each has an identity
agreed by the two referees.</i>

43:38.240 --> 43:41.280
Now bat harder or
play without shoes!

43:41.720 --> 43:45.440
This game of yours Madgett has
everything in it except the kitchen sink.

43:45.520 --> 43:46.920
Thank you.

43:47.160 --> 43:49.561
When played inland Mrs Hardy...

43:49.721 --> 43:53.319
<i>The more important identities
are the emperor,</i>

43:53.319 --> 43:55.761
<i>the red queen, the widow,</i>

43:55.800 --> 43:57.241
<i>the fat lady,</i>

43:57.401 --> 44:00.760
<i>the dunce, the judge,
the hangman,</i>

44:01.200 --> 44:02.200
<i>the harlot</i>

44:02.400 --> 44:04.080
Come on you two, out!

44:04.081 --> 44:05.781
<i>the businessman, the maiden</i>

44:05.840 --> 44:07.681
Go and do your
fornication elsewhere.

44:07.720 --> 44:10.600
It's not fornication any more

44:10.720 --> 44:13.680
You buy a marriage licence
and it becomes legal

44:13.760 --> 44:15.521
Not on my couch
it doesn't.

44:16.201 --> 44:20.881
I'll give you 3 minutes to make yourself decent.
Hasn't the novelty worn off yet.

44:20.920 --> 44:24.880
Well you see Hardy, we've only
been married for two hours.

44:25.041 --> 44:26.360
Oh like hell!

44:26.480 --> 44:30.280
Every cow in every field in the district
has seen the colour of your arse Bellamy.

44:33.440 --> 44:34.880
Crabby idiot!

44:38.200 --> 44:39.761
Hey do you think
he ever did it?

44:40.361 --> 44:41.960
Ask Cissy.

44:42.280 --> 44:45.320
<i>The adulterer can only
play with the harlot..</i>

44:45.520 --> 44:49.401
<i>when each has an even
number of lives above twelve</i>

44:53.680 --> 44:57.641
I am Marina, I'm Bellamy's
sister. Are you Madgett ? - I am

44:58.880 --> 45:02.281
If I am in mourning, why do
I have to catch one handed?

45:02.561 --> 45:04.560
Grief is a handicap my dear.

45:04.920 --> 45:07.280
So is not being
able to see.

45:08.200 --> 45:12.281
<i>The mother in-law is only
allotted 5 runs at a time</i>

45:12.401 --> 45:14.081
<i>after which she must defer</i>

45:14.241 --> 45:16.520
<i>to the gravedigger
who is allowed to add</i>

45:16.560 --> 45:20.880
<i>the number of runs of each
competitor he bowls out to his own.</i>

45:22.841 --> 45:24.200
Out Hardy !

45:24.280 --> 45:25.840
She's cheating!

45:26.640 --> 45:30.121
I do not want to put fetish punch
and judy shows on lonely bachelors

45:30.281 --> 45:32.759
nor do I run a bordello
for newly weds.

45:33.240 --> 45:36.681
If the phone rings, or if
someone breaks their leg

45:36.681 --> 45:39.880
or if you decide to play a proper
game I'll be in the sea swimming!

45:42.320 --> 45:43.721
Hardy's right.

45:44.121 --> 45:46.961
This is my wedding party, why
can't we play some proper cricket.

45:47.081 --> 45:47.999
To dangerous!

45:50.160 --> 45:53.680
<i>The maiden is always
obliged to be a spectator</i>

45:53.680 --> 45:56.001
<i>unless she is
partnered by the twins.</i>

45:56.200 --> 45:59.400
Good afternoon, remember us?
We're the Bognor brothers, I'm Jonah

45:59.641 --> 46:01.281
- and I'm Moses.
- I remember

46:01.880 --> 46:02.881
We'd like a word with you.

46:03.041 --> 46:05.480
In private
if possible.

46:14.040 --> 46:18.080
Well what the hell do you know about cricket?
it's no more dangerous than any other game.

46:18.720 --> 46:23.040
1931, Chapman Ridger,
Australia.

46:23.520 --> 46:25.080
A blow to
the chest.

46:25.401 --> 46:29.800
Scores 51 runs, then has heart
palpitations for 12 hours...

46:30.000 --> 46:33.600
a cracked rib enters the
lung, coughing blood

46:33.761 --> 46:38.280
dies the next day in bed with a
blonde surfer called Adeline.

46:40.680 --> 46:44.400
Summer of 52. Blow to the
top of the head... coma...

46:44.800 --> 46:48.760
His last know words are :
"Bugger Bognor".

46:49.681 --> 46:51.761
No sorry that was
Edward the seventh.

46:52.121 --> 46:54.640
Sorry chaps, no offence.

46:54.760 --> 46:57.080
What's a matter with
Madgett? He hates cricket.

46:57.241 --> 46:58.520
He's showing off.

46:58.640 --> 47:00.200
He likes acting...

47:00.761 --> 47:03.400
He might just be distracting everyone
from what's happening....

47:03.480 --> 47:04.800
in the sea.

47:13.200 --> 47:15.960
<i>The business man can
be saved if he submits...</i>

47:16.161 --> 47:17.481
<i>to a red queen</i>

47:17.521 --> 47:20.280
<i>but in doing so he
must pay a forfit.</i>

47:33.161 --> 47:34.921
It's alright, it's
alright mother...Cissy

47:37.160 --> 47:39.440
Get them out of here and
go and find some scissors.

47:39.960 --> 47:42.641
I'm alright mother just leave
me alone I just want to be still.

47:43.721 --> 47:47.280
If you have a hangman you
have to pair with a judge...

47:47.280 --> 47:50.640
By the time we've learnt
your rules it'll be dark.

47:50.920 --> 47:53.560
Anything worth learning
takes a little time.

47:55.760 --> 47:57.120
Cut my hair

47:58.320 --> 47:59.960
I'll feel better

48:08.880 --> 48:10.920
You eat
too much.

48:32.521 --> 48:36.760
<i>The full flavour of the game of
hangman's cricket, is best appreciated</i>

48:36.800 --> 48:41.041
<i>after the game has been
played for several hours.</i>

48:41.321 --> 48:45.881
<i>By then every player has a
fair understanding of the many rules</i>

48:46.040 --> 48:49.281
<i>and knows which character
he wants to play permanently.</i>

48:50.120 --> 48:52.840
<i>Finally an outright
loser is found,</i>

48:52.960 --> 48:55.800
<i>and is obliged to present
himself to the hangman</i>

48:55.800 --> 48:58.120
<i>who is always merciless.</i>

49:24.440 --> 49:27.080
I haven't
found 54 yet.

49:29.721 --> 49:33.600
Send her a horse chesnut tree
in Nightingale Lane.

49:33.920 --> 49:35.960
Here it's near a
water hydrant.

49:39.120 --> 49:43.040
Then Delilah cut off
Samson's hair, I think.

49:43.800 --> 49:48.159
At a large party he summoned
up the last of his strength

49:48.400 --> 49:51.960
held onto two pillars and
pulled the house down.

49:52.280 --> 49:57.240
His last words were -
"and take good care of Nelly"

49:57.520 --> 49:58.840
Who is Nelly?

49:59.440 --> 50:00.361
This is Nelly

50:01.000 --> 50:04.201
Although she sometimes
insists on being called Nancy.

50:04.240 --> 50:06.280
It was Charles the second

50:07.520 --> 50:10.881
His last words were -
"and take good care of Nelly"

50:11.041 --> 50:12.361
Who told you that?

50:12.361 --> 50:15.760
My mother, she said she'd
wished she'd been Nell Gwynne

50:16.160 --> 50:18.920
Because she'd liked to
have serviced Charles II.

50:26.921 --> 50:29.880
You really could skip
more out on the road.

50:30.040 --> 50:32.160
The rope wouldn't slap on
the doorstep that way.

50:32.680 --> 50:34.881
My mother says
I'm not to go out.

50:34.921 --> 50:37.560
It's dangerous, there
are evil men about.

50:37.920 --> 50:38.639
Hold still.

50:40.800 --> 50:43.521
Alright next.
Off stump crease

50:44.120 --> 50:46.000
Left handed bat

50:46.960 --> 50:48.400
Left arm bowler.

50:52.201 --> 50:54.320
New ball....soft ground

50:55.040 --> 50:56.240
off spinner...oh

51:01.761 --> 51:03.000
Too low.

51:05.680 --> 51:08.440
Difficult to see how the ball hit him there but still.

51:12.640 --> 51:14.760
Tolly Schriker, 1931.

51:14.961 --> 51:18.081
Scored 58 runs with
one eye closed,

51:18.160 --> 51:20.960
before falling down
pavilion steps.

51:21.160 --> 51:24.760
Died in "Brisbane Municipal??"
another black cross.

51:35.401 --> 51:36.440
Hold still.

51:41.281 --> 51:42.840
Smut, pour Cissy
a cup of tea.

51:43.041 --> 51:47.201
Oh don't bother, I'll pour if
you're busy playing cricket

51:49.761 --> 51:52.560
Bellamy has given
me this idea

51:52.920 --> 51:56.241
for a book of
cricketing deaths

51:57.160 --> 51:59.881
games can be
very dangerous

52:05.880 --> 52:08.240
Madgett you
could talk with Cissy

52:08.480 --> 52:09.840
Why could I?

52:10.960 --> 52:14.000
Marrying Bellamy isn't the best
thing she could've done

52:14.321 --> 52:15.881
A bit
late now.

52:16.921 --> 52:19.680
Why saddle herself
with his lechery?

52:20.720 --> 52:21.920
Are you against lechery?

52:22.080 --> 52:23.160
You know
I'm not.

52:23.401 --> 52:24.960
How do I
know that?

52:25.960 --> 52:26.680
You don't.

52:45.400 --> 52:47.160
Try along
that hedge.

53:05.201 --> 53:06.601
May I kiss
you?

53:08.120 --> 53:11.401
If you like
just here though

53:12.560 --> 53:14.161
Oh that's chaste.

53:14.921 --> 53:18.320
Please believe I appreciate
your attentions,

53:18.600 --> 53:21.161
but you'll have
to wait a little while.

53:21.841 --> 53:26.400
and who knows, your
prospects might improve.

53:27.760 --> 53:30.161
Cissy's more your age.

53:30.961 --> 53:33.400
But don't go getting
ideas about Hardy

53:34.920 --> 53:36.761
This time I'm not
playing games.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.121
Don't you?

53:38.921 --> 53:41.199
It's impossible
to tell with you

53:41.920 --> 53:44.640
I don't think you really
know yourself do you?

53:56.320 --> 53:59.320
May I see what I've
always wanted to see?

53:59.486 --> 54:00.867
What is that?

54:01.400 --> 54:04.520
You, without
any clothes on.

54:05.759 --> 54:08.000
What a strange desire.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.680
That's a strange
game Madgett.

54:11.681 --> 54:12.681
Is it?

54:15.040 --> 54:18.040
and here is certainly
not the time and place.

54:20.961 --> 54:24.080
Are you going to the
police if I don't co-operate.

54:25.320 --> 54:26.760
I might.

54:47.240 --> 54:51.281
There was a man at Pulham Market,
who died in his car.

54:52.641 --> 54:54.880
He was wealthy, a farmer.

54:56.680 --> 54:59.840
He drove his car into
a wood near Thomstot

55:00.080 --> 55:03.920
turned off the engine,
made himself comfortable

55:04.920 --> 55:06.840
and quietly died.

55:08.480 --> 55:12.560
I could find absolutely
nothing wrong with him.

55:14.480 --> 55:17.760
I expect he died of unrequited love.

55:19.440 --> 55:22.200
Is that what you do when you
can't find a reason for death.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.321
write - "died of unrequited love"

55:26.680 --> 55:30.160
In his case I wrote
"heart attack after bowls match"

55:30.760 --> 55:32.681
Trust you to
put a game in.

55:35.720 --> 55:37.239
You didn't stay long..

55:38.920 --> 55:40.000
Where is
your torch.

55:40.160 --> 55:41.481
I lost it.

55:41.482 --> 55:42.482
What do you mean?

55:43.361 --> 55:44.760
I'll come and
get it tomorrow

55:44.880 --> 55:47.000
Did you catch
anything interesting?

55:47.400 --> 55:48.640
Nothing much.

55:52.400 --> 55:55.680
Lets go to my place and
I'll make some supper.

58:19.400 --> 58:22.640
When you want something Hardy
how do you ask for it?

58:22.920 --> 58:24.760
I say please.

58:27.401 --> 58:30.640
Please Hardy
can we have a fuck.

58:31.800 --> 58:35.401
Or if I'm in the office I'll pick
up the phone and dial 9.

58:56.770 --> 58:58.076
Emergency, which service...

58:58.080 --> 59:01.401
All I get is the police the ambulance or
the fire brigade, which one do you want.

59:01.760 --> 59:03.119
- Do you want to speak to them?
- No thank you

59:03.120 --> 59:04.620
Which service
do you require?

59:05.040 --> 59:09.200
I'm sorry there is no fire, accident,
burglary, rape or murder.

59:09.641 --> 59:10.641
yet

59:10.642 --> 59:11.642
thank you

59:14.240 --> 59:16.921
But don't go away because
we might need you.

59:17.960 --> 59:21.080
I usually find that
one 9 suffices.

59:21.240 --> 59:24.040
and if it doesn't
I write a note.

59:24.481 --> 59:26.121
- A memorandum
- Yes

59:26.521 --> 59:28.639
Well I suppose
I could try that

59:55.080 --> 59:59.321
and if pressed, you know very well
I'll do the best I can to oblige.

59:59.321 --> 01:00:02.000
- You're so considerate
- You're so imaginative

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.520
Well I have to be
for the two of us

01:00:23.481 --> 01:00:26.280
Mind the juice doesn't
stain the sofa.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.561
Show me
your tongue.

01:00:33.161 --> 01:00:36.080
Just as I thought, it's yellow.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.360
Does that mean
I'm unwell.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:38.800
What do
you think?

01:00:39.641 --> 01:00:44.560
A little colouring goes a long way
artificial colouring can be dangerous.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.801
So can too much
abstinence

01:01:02.545 --> 01:01:04.369
Hardy

01:01:06.481 --> 01:01:08.400
Now I need
warming up.

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:14.641
My mother says

01:01:15.479 --> 01:01:18.160
that hot tea
on a hot day

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.801
can make a body
feel very cool.

01:01:21.361 --> 01:01:23.439
You're about to
make some tea?

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:29.240
I'm not
that thirsty.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.960
What does your mother
say about swimming?

01:01:40.999 --> 01:01:42.240
Reading between
the lines,

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.041
I'd say she's made at least one public
statement about bodies in water.

01:01:46.041 --> 01:01:49.840
You Colpitt's women always have a lot of
trouble with men, why do you think that is?

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.760
I'll leave you to
think about that.

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:54.080
Oh I always think much
better in the bath.

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.360
I wonder if it was
the same with Jake?

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.721
I don't think Jake was
much of a thinking man.

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.481
I'm going for a swim.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.440
Hope you drown.

01:02:06.441 --> 01:02:07.441
Thank you.

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.721
You can look after
the typewriter.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.560
Bugger your typewriter!

01:03:11.119 --> 01:03:13.280
K.I.S.S.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.560
M.E.

01:03:15.881 --> 01:03:18.081
H.A.R.D.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.160
Stupid bloody idiot.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.800
What's the matter?

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.400
My stomach.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:56.961
Don't fool around,
just get me out.

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:00.840
- I've just ruined your very best typewriter.
- You what?

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:04.080
and now I'm going to do
my best to drown you.

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:06.401
The Colpitt prerogative.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.720
You're so stubborn
you won't sink

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.480
Get me out,
for god's sake.

01:05:21.481 --> 01:05:22.481
Get me out.

01:05:22.881 --> 01:05:24.800
You think I
can't do it?

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.200
Start drowning
you dope.

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.280
You haven't
a chance.

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:38.801
That was a preliminary,
here comes the real attempt.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.640
It must be your money
that keeps you afloat.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.720
You and your belly
are stubborn.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:56.880
Please, I can't
move my legs

01:06:13.041 --> 01:06:14.280
Help

01:06:14.964 --> 01:06:17.044
Help please

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.360
Leave me now.

01:06:31.239 --> 01:06:32.960
I want to be
alone with him.

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.641
We can't
leave you.

01:06:34.761 --> 01:06:37.241
Yes you can
he's my husband

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:38.720
Where is your phone?

01:06:41.921 --> 01:06:44.560
It's alright, you must
let me phone the police.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.480
or the ambulance

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.040
or the fire brigade

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.760
and the coroner.

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.081
Are you sure you're
going to be alright?

01:07:01.241 --> 01:07:04.440
If you want a witness
our name is Van Dyke.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:15.280
Mr 70 and Mr 71 Van Dyke.

01:08:43.439 --> 01:08:44.960
Smut go and
get the tea.

01:08:47.479 --> 01:08:50.200
You women are getting
too proficient at this.

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:52.000
We aim to please
the coroner.

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.479
The body is
already undressed.

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.880
I did not imagine he went
swimming with his clothes on

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.120
Doesn't it make
it easier for you?

01:09:00.279 --> 01:09:02.720
Nothing you do makes
it easier for me.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.720
You've got to stop.

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:10.881
One is just possible,
two is very unlikely.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:15.000
You have no prerogative
on drowning.

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:17.840
The coroners office
is inviolate

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.161
- Not violation.
- Yeah of course it's not.

01:09:21.319 --> 01:09:23.321
Don't be so
melodramatic Madgett.

01:09:23.361 --> 01:09:24.600
I feel ill.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.560
Why do you always feel
ill at times like this?

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:30.321
It's the excitement,
it goes to my stomach.

01:09:30.481 --> 01:09:33.700
Haha Id have thought you'd
have got over that by now.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.560
It's only with
special cases.

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:39.881
Drownings?

01:09:40.041 --> 01:09:42.279
Yes, and the women.

01:09:42.281 --> 01:09:43.281
Women?

01:09:43.319 --> 01:09:46.761
Yeah, and personal
involvements.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.800
Haven't you heard
of coincidence?

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.279
I've heard
of it.

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.600
Doesn't it
appeal to you?

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:57.560
Only as an idea, not
as a police enquiry

01:09:59.372 --> 01:10:00.461
Cissy

01:10:01.481 --> 01:10:03.040
Where did
it happen?

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.680
On the beach.

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:07.280
Could you say where
exactly on the beach.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.001
Oh it's covered now
with the tide.

01:10:10.001 --> 01:10:12.681
Smut you haven't brought
your red paint?

01:10:12.681 --> 01:10:17.080
No Cissy, today's Tuesday,
Tuesday's colour is yellow.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:24.560
I am bound to say that I could try and
revive him even now, it has been know...

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:27.840
Don't be stupid
Madgett and don't try.

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:31.200
The man's name is
Hardy and not Lazarus.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:36.281
Now let us turn to
page 72. Jean, 11

01:10:36.441 --> 01:10:37.320
verse 23.

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:41.040
Jesus says unto them... :

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.841
my brother

01:11:16.241 --> 01:11:18.480
I shouldn't take
it too seriously.

01:11:19.439 --> 01:11:23.320
A great many things are dying
very violently all the time.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.121
Ask Smut.

01:11:25.801 --> 01:11:28.000
Small comfort
Madgett.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.800
On the contrary,
I'd say a great relief.

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.480
Well I'd rather be alive and
alone than dead in company.

01:11:42.721 --> 01:11:44.081
What are you
doing that for?

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:47.160
Smut... he quite liked Hardy...

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:50.160
and there's been a robbery
at the fireworks factory.

01:11:56.561 --> 01:11:57.840
Water!

01:12:23.961 --> 01:12:25.601
Hail Mary!

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:28.820
- Bloody hell, Madgett!
- Cissy!

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:30.960
Oh god there's those two
runners from the beach

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.321
and Nancy.

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:34.999
Hardy's mother,
Jake's cousin

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.040
I wonder what they're
planning now?

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.721
It's one conspiracy
against another.

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:46.000
Yours against theirs, yours
to drown and theirs to prosecute.

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:50.161
Bloody hell there's Bellamy
and he hates funerals.

01:12:50.401 --> 01:12:51.840
I'm going to find out
what he's doing.

01:12:51.999 --> 01:12:53.480
No don't
do that.

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.160
Drive on Madgett,

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.999
We don't want to get into a lot of
arguments with all this water over our heads.

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:13.881
Then this woman tipped a bowl of sugar and
a bottle of lemonade over his typewriter.

01:13:13.881 --> 01:13:17.120
He went for a swim in the sea and
because he had eaten too much

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.600
he got stomach
cramps and drowned.

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:22.641
She gave him the kiss
of life but it didn't work.

01:13:22.641 --> 01:13:24.040
She knew it
wouldn't.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:28.721
She cut all his hair of with a pair
of blunt scissors, just like Delilah.

01:13:29.161 --> 01:13:31.281
This game's called hangman's cricket

01:13:31.281 --> 01:13:32.879
What's that
about hangmen?

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:36.360
It's a game of cricket, you
really need 75 players.

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.561
six sides of 12
and 3 umpires.

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:45.881
Have you got any
more of these?

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.760
Hundreds.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.280
- Where do they come from?
- I've taken them

01:13:52.601 --> 01:13:56.281
You've taken them?
I don't believe you

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:07.760
What was all
that about?

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:12.601
- Nothing, he's a friend of my mothers.
- I'm going to another party tonight.

01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:15.960
A dance hall over-looking
the sea with lights.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.480
We'd have crab paste,
sprats in batter

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.441
and be sick in
air-line bags

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:23.440
We're each going to be given a
black rabbit as a going home present.

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:31.039
How come a non-swimmer belongs
to a water tower conspiracy Bellamy??

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.040
What?

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:34.200
A water
tower conspiracy.

01:14:34.561 --> 01:14:35.480
You've noticed?

01:14:35.481 --> 01:14:36.481
Come on!

01:14:36.641 --> 01:14:38.319
It's just a convenient
place to meet.

01:14:38.439 --> 01:14:40.760
What and is there
a subscription list?

01:14:40.761 --> 01:14:41.761
Yes

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.480
All those that think the
Colpitt's deaths are not accidental.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.640
I guessed
that much.

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.640
What do you intend
doing about it?

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:51.161
For a start get
Madgett investigated.

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:55.400
That sounds business like, are you
going to alert the water board?

01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:05.820
- Poor cows.
- Bloody hell.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.441
This is no blood,
it's red paint!

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:09.880
That little ghoul's
been here already!

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.000
I thought I could
smell gun powder...

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.640
I thought it was
the smell of death.

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.560
It's too early for
that yet...

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:19.040
Bellamy, this
conspiracy of yours...

01:15:19.361 --> 01:15:21.520
Do you regard me
as an accessory?

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:24.000
'cause if I am I better
get rid of you quick.

01:15:24.241 --> 01:15:25.920
I'd like to
see you try.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:33.080
I don't think you're allowed
to screw your wife in prison.

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:37.360
So I suggest that if you
are seriously thinking of it..

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:40.800
you make good use
of my free time now.

01:15:42.201 --> 01:15:44.541
- Kiss my back side.
- No

01:15:45.239 --> 01:15:46.720
Not here
you fool!

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:47.920
Why not?

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:24.200
Alright Smut, try
the hawthorns.

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.480
Well Cissy

01:16:49.241 --> 01:16:50.481
Will you
marry me?

01:16:52.927 --> 01:16:54.882
No Madgett.

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:57.000
I could never
marry a coroner.

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:00.800
I could never be sure that
you'd washed your hands.

01:17:03.121 --> 01:17:05.240
Besides, how could I
trust a game player?

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:09.440
I'm not playing games
at this particular moment.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:12.200
Well you're far more entertaining
when you are Madgett.

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:18.520
Besides, you're far more valuable
to me as a friend

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:20.440
than a coroner.

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:22.041
How about

01:17:23.281 --> 01:17:24.640
as a lover?

01:17:27.029 --> 01:17:28.642
Well

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.601
I admit to
drowning Hardy,

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:36.041
possibly for not being
a satisfactory lover.

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.080
Give or take an inch you
could get into his trousers,

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:43.640
but I don't think I drowned him
so that you could get into his bed.

01:17:46.601 --> 01:17:49.119
Cissy is looking for
a father figure.

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:55.120
But much as I dislike Bellamy, don't go
getting ideas, remember. You're a coroner.

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:58.279
All coroners see
are corpses.

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.881
Well they won't
reject you.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:06.840
Tell me Madgett, have you ever fallen
in love with one of your corpses?

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:09.360
Yes, several.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.000
Did you ever...

01:18:14.479 --> 01:18:15.680
do anything?

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:22.039
I once kissed an old lady of 82...

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:23.960
on the forehead.

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:26.480
She was twice
my age.

01:18:27.601 --> 01:18:30.760
Is that all? Was
she the only one?

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.680
No but I'm not
saying any more.

01:18:34.681 --> 01:18:36.181
Oh really Madgett!

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.800
Tell me.

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.320
I once sat up all night

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:47.160
with a young girl who had
been run over by cows.

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:51.160
There wasn't a mark on her but
her skull had been fractured.

01:18:51.881 --> 01:18:54.361
She was 19.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:58.360
She had blonde hair
and bright blue eyes.

01:18:59.721 --> 01:19:01.520
If she was dead how could
you see the colour of her eyes?

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:05.880
Ah well that was the problem. I
couldn't bring myself to close themr.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.081
They were beautiful.

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:09.800
So what
did you do?

01:19:09.961 --> 01:19:12.840
I sat next to her
and held her hand...

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.841
and I'm not saying anymore but
I wasn't invited to the funeral.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:21.480
I tell you what,
you can come to mine.

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:24.560
I'm inviting you
now, and...

01:19:25.481 --> 01:19:29.880
I don't mind on the whole if
you take a few liberties.

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:33.441
as long as they're
not too gross.

01:19:34.561 --> 01:19:37.560
Infact if I was very old I'd
probably be very flattered.

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:41.760
I would prefer to be encouraged
to take liberties now.

01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:45.640
Well I certainly don't
feel like it at the moment.

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:51.760
My reputation is at stake thanks
to you and your mother

01:19:51.921 --> 01:19:55.720
and I'm quite sure that Smut
would not want a father who's...

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:57.120
...an accomplice
to murder.

01:19:58.281 --> 01:19:59.801
He understands.

01:20:02.159 --> 01:20:04.520
Coroners need corpses.

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:07.960
Like grave diggers
need corpses.

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:12.240
Notice how Sid follows him
around like a black shadow?

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.121
Sid's known him
since he was a baby.

01:20:15.281 --> 01:20:18.280
He's certainly going to be very
interesting when he grows up.

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:22.200
Yes I've noticed how you're
all so very fond of kissing him.

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:26.320
Where has
he gone?

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:28.960
He's probably
sloped off home.

01:20:30.921 --> 01:20:32.640
We must go
black berrying.

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:35.720
You could come
with us.

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.840
No thank you.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.040
Smut'll need to count them

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:42.960
and his counting drives
me up the wall.

01:20:50.481 --> 01:20:51.640
Smut, are
you in?

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:54.320
His light's on,
he's probably asleep.

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.520
I wonder if he's
caught anything.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.360
My god... Smut !

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.121
He's circumcised himself.

01:21:26.079 --> 01:21:27.360
Call a doctor.

01:21:28.121 --> 01:21:29.481
I can't look.

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.161
What did you do it with?

01:21:37.321 --> 01:21:41.080
It's alright Cissy, I
sterilised the scissors.

01:21:54.841 --> 01:21:56.000
It's not funny.

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:04.080
Stop striking about in the water
like a stranded fish.

01:22:04.881 --> 01:22:06.240
Use your
legs Bellamy!

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:09.080
You're just here to
make fun of me.

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:12.320
No don't, come on lets try
a link, take your floats off.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.920
No I'm not
ready yet.

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:17.921
Yes you are, come here..

01:22:29.001 --> 01:22:29.961
Don't.

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.080
Someone might
come in.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:35.840
You said we had
the place to ourselves.

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:39.760
Frightened of being seen
wallowing in the water like a baby?

01:22:42.601 --> 01:22:43.320
Come here

01:22:55.399 --> 01:22:58.480
You are getting more
confident in water.

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:01.000
Take your
costume off.

01:23:01.641 --> 01:23:06.240
Don't worry, I've locked the
doors. Here's the key, look.

01:26:28.241 --> 01:26:30.439
Madgett, what the
devil are you doing here?

01:26:30.599 --> 01:26:31.480
Picking blackberries.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.120
We've been looking
everywhere for you.

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:37.001
Well we've been
picking blackberries..

01:26:37.641 --> 01:26:40.800
Vitamin C is very
good for eunuchs.

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.481
I don't use mine,

01:26:45.641 --> 01:26:47.599
and Smut can't use
his for the moment.

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:49.800
Madgett, are you drunk?

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:52.800
You can't get drunk on
blackberries can you?

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:53.960
You smell

01:26:54.121 --> 01:26:59.120
I do, well I haven't had
a bath since Monday.

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.240
Well you couldn't say
that about Bellamy.

01:27:01.401 --> 01:27:05.320
Oh yes, he's been
bathing too has he?

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.200
Perhaps drinking
it a little?

01:27:10.201 --> 01:27:13.960
Maybe with a bit
of chlorine in it?

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:18.600
and drinking enough perhaps
to put out a fire like this?

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.320
How did
you know?

01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:23.640
Drowning like most
things come in threes.

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.560
You're sinister.

01:27:27.361 --> 01:27:28.920
I am sinister?

01:27:35.041 --> 01:27:36.559
What's dead now?

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:37.560
Just about everything.

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:40.720
Just about everything
in this feild I should think.

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:05.600
There's Jonah and Moses, Jake's cousins.
I didn't know they were keen runners.

01:28:05.761 --> 01:28:07.600
Good lord
there's Nancy

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:16.321
What's all this
running for?

01:28:16.321 --> 01:28:18.040
Why have
you stopped?

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:20.320
I've had enough, I'm
not helping anymore.

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.200
You must.

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.240
Why, why
must I do it?

01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:25.680
Madgett you're up
to your neck in this.

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:38.360
It didn't take you long to
drown your husband did it.

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:41.561
Three weeks,
will they give me bail?

01:28:42.081 --> 01:28:46.680
Well you only had one husband, so
you can't drown another, so they might

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:49.921
Do they have swimming
pools in prison?

01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:53.520
Unlikely.

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:57.041
How come you only
gave him three weeks?

01:28:57.161 --> 01:28:58.880
I was disappointed.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:04.360
I don't really understand why you had
to find out that you didn't know before.

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.400
If that
was only it.

01:29:06.881 --> 01:29:09.520
I don't understand why
you had to do it at all.

01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:13.641
Loyalty you dope, and
I got what I wanted.

01:29:16.159 --> 01:29:17.680
I'm going
to be sick.

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:22.080
What do you mean you
got what you wanted?

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:26.720
Madgett, can I speak here or
do you want to come outside?

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:28.680
You can
speak here.

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:31.601
You have your
permission, go ahead.

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:34.760
Well we went looking
for you at your house.

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.040
We found these.

01:29:38.721 --> 01:29:42.560
Then we discovered some more in
a house on Amsterdam Road.

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:47.241
and lets say, we obtained
some from another source.

01:29:48.481 --> 01:29:50.720
Perhaps you'd like
to talk about them?

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:53.360
What do you
want me to say?

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:56.360
To a casual eye they
could be suspicious.

01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:00.400
Could they?
Cissy, look at these.

01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:06.040
It's Smut, he's put on a
lot of weight in a month

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:08.320
These are good
aren't they.

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:10.960
How did
he do it?

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:12.721
In the hospital report

01:30:13.879 --> 01:30:18.280
I believe your son was taken in for what
can only be described as sexual mutilation

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:24.039
You better ask
Smut about that

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:27.320
You better know Madgett
you're under investigation

01:30:28.401 --> 01:30:29.721
Whatever for?

01:30:29.881 --> 01:30:33.360
For procuring pornography
and maybe child abuse

01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:38.121
Why don't you throw in a
little light necrophilia as well?

01:30:38.121 --> 01:30:41.960
You see Madgett, I told you.
Smut'll get you in the end.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.400
We're here to discuss my husband
and not the family photographs.

01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:02.241
He could so easily have
changed the bulb.

01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:04.880
Here, this
might help.

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:13.320
I like his
feet.

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:18.161
I like his
shoulders.

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:21.800
What do you like?

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:23.520
I like a natural
death.

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:26.320
Is any death
natural?

01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:31.720
I liked his
bollocks.

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:42.680
Are widows eligible for the Olympic Games?

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:51.440
What on earth do you
keep all these sheep for?

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:54.200
I keep them for
emergencies.

01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:56.240
What emergency?

01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:57.841
Sleepless nights.

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:01.319
I count best
at night.

01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:03.840
We all count
best at night.

01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:08.840
That's it Smut, not an inch further
or I'll shake you out of that tree

01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:11.000
What's he doing?

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.080
He's counting
the leaves.

01:32:12.081 --> 01:32:13.081
Whatever for?

01:32:14.161 --> 01:32:16.560
Have you never wondered how
many leaves there are on a tree?

01:32:16.561 --> 01:32:17.561
Never

01:32:18.039 --> 01:32:19.840
Or fish in
the sea?

01:32:19.841 --> 01:32:20.841
Nope

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:23.640
- Or hairs on your head?
- No

01:32:25.801 --> 01:32:29.151
On this Saturday we'll put
the ashes in the sea

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:31.480
or rather the river.

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.041
You Madgett
can be a witness.

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:36.360
What do you
want a witness for?

01:32:36.679 --> 01:32:38.880
To make sure we do it
correctly of course.

01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:41.281
Isn't it
illegal?

01:32:41.282 --> 01:32:42.282
No

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:09.680
We're altogether here
no need for secrecy.

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:11.920
What on earth made
you choose this place?

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:15.520
I thought the water tower would mean
we could keep them under surveillance.

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:16.680
Who officially
invited them?

01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:19.200
They invited
themselves.

01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:22.561
Are you sure Madgett
didn't say something?

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:30.561
and there's the
pyrotechnical expert.

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:34.320
It just won't light,
it's too damp.

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:38.480
It's not surprising, Bellamy was
pretty wet out of the water.

01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:45.600
What's that smell?

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:55.241
- That man has a nose for a corpse
- His son is quicker.

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:56.761
What are they?

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.841
You know you've got yours
coming to you  don't you?

01:34:05.121 --> 01:34:08.080
An invitation to that
field near Brough

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:10.680
which is surrounded
by that thick hedge

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:14.920
where Smut is sent to catch moths
and never returns with any

01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:18.440
Madgett's harmless.

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:21.600
He's really only interested in
games and chocolate pudding.

01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:24.800
I wouldn't mind.

01:34:25.501 --> 01:34:26.701
What wouldn't
you mind.

01:34:26.801 --> 01:34:29.280
It would be like
sleeping with your uncle.

01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:32.680
It would be like
bribing the referee.

01:34:32.681 --> 01:34:34.845
- What would?
- More than a referee

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:39.280
Poor Madgett, it's like the story
of Billy Goat Gruff.

01:34:39.281 --> 01:34:40.281
What is?

01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:44.761
Well with Madgett as the
goblin under the bridge.

01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:49.280
Do you think the grass is really
greener across the stream

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:51.800
Without a doubt.

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:58.040
Here's a herring, do you
think they're edible?

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:02.161
Well now Cissy
it's your turn.

01:35:03.879 --> 01:35:05.840
I like his
hands.

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:10.001
I might let him touch me
then I'll tell you all about it.

01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.480
Well you are the
last in the line.

01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.680
What if you were
to be disappointed?

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:20.199
That might spoil it, you better
not go too far then

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:23.520
If one of us were
to make it with him,

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:26.280
surely it would exclude
the other two?

01:35:26.841 --> 01:35:30.360
I doubt if Madgett could get it
up three times in an afternoon.

01:35:36.759 --> 01:35:39.200
Madgett we've been
talking about you.

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:41.440
I know.

01:35:44.879 --> 01:35:48.000
Could you get it up three times
in an afternoon Madgett?

01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:53.560
I'd like to try, it
depends who's asking.

01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:55.400
Hey look at these.

01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:58.040
These fish are
all numbered, look.

01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:00.640
Smut, did you
organise this?

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:10.200
Are you going to try the same thing
on me as you tried on the others?

01:36:11.079 --> 01:36:14.480
You don't think Bellamy drowned
to make way for you do you?

01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:17.481
It's strange.

01:36:17.482 --> 01:36:18.482
What is?

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:22.920
How this feild is synonomous
with my failure.

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:24.601
Where's Smut?

01:36:24.761 --> 01:36:26.439
Oh he wouldn't
come anymore.

01:36:26.559 --> 01:36:28.000
I don't blame him.

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:33.761
Three rebuffs in the same place

01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:35.759
that must be a record.

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:39.320
Sounds to me like you should
have more imagination.

01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:44.320
You can't swim, can you?

01:36:44.799 --> 01:36:47.880
Anyway I'm too
young for you

01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:52.079
Suppose you're in a good
position to try blackmail.

01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:56.120
You could put all three of
us away if you wanted to.

01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:58.840
That's the last
thing I want to do.

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:01.119
I believe you.

01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:06.800
As you've had such
bad luck with the others

01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:11.401
I'll let you go a
little of the way.

01:37:14.121 --> 01:37:15.721
As compensation ?

01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:18.720
Put your
hand here.

01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:24.400
I've watched you
watching me.

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:27.960
I've watched you
watching all of us.

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:31.961
Do you think we're
the same woman?

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.480
Sometimes I do.

01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:38.121
Just because we've all
got the same name?

01:37:38.122 --> 01:37:39.122
No no

01:37:40.161 --> 01:37:41.240
Why then?

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:47.080
Because of your
camaraderie

01:37:47.748 --> 01:37:48.981
Our what?

01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:51.920
Your friendship for
one another.

01:37:52.961 --> 01:37:54.800
Do you know that
I'm pregnant?

01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.600
Was three
weeks enough?

01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:01.920
Ha Madgett don't
be so innocent.

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:05.001
Three weeks was long
enough to legitamise

01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:10.760
You can kiss
me here.

01:38:14.799 --> 01:38:16.400
Will I taste anything?

01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:18.480
Not yet
you dope.

01:38:20.641 --> 01:38:22.120
Take the
rest off.

01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:25.760
No Madgett, I'm a
widow of 48 hours.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.761
Madgett that's enough!

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:34.040
You must be satisfied with small
services, a little at a time

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:35.520
Must I?

01:38:37.081 --> 01:38:39.960
Was saving you from
prison a small service?

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:42.080
It was death
through misadventure.

01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:46.320
Was it? There's a lot of people round
here don't think that way at all.

01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:48.519
To hell with
the others.

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:50.080
You're deliberatly
provoking me.

01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:51.280
Am I?

01:38:53.269 --> 01:38:55.279
Thank you for making
me see reason.

01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:57.320
About Bellamy.

01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:59.040
That wasn't me,
that was Cissy.

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:01.121
No well you made
it possible

01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:04.760
I knew when I
married Bellamy

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:09.040
with you around when the
time came I could drown him.

01:39:10.877 --> 01:39:12.278
No

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:14.720
Madgett is this
attempted rape?

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:16.600
You Colpitt women
have used me

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:19.160
Madgett you're supposed
to be harmless

01:39:19.641 --> 01:39:21.120
You have
destroyed me.

01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:23.160
Don't be so
melodramatic!

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:43.720
The best days for violent deaths
are Tuesdays in the afternoon.

01:39:44.041 --> 01:39:48.120
The safest time of all is
Friday night...tonight infact.

01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:50.520
Are you going to
a party tonight?

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:52.320
Yes, on a boat.

01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:56.120
We're to have pineapple fruit salad, cheese
with walnuts and I'm going to dance.

01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:57.880
and I'm going
to dance.

01:39:59.521 --> 01:40:01.799
Elsie, I love you.

01:40:02.719 --> 01:40:05.320
- I've done what you asked me to do.
- What's that?

01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:08.400
I circumsised myself,
do you want to look?

01:40:08.561 --> 01:40:10.240
No thank you,
not today.

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:15.601
Smut, get in.

01:40:16.654 --> 01:40:17.626
Bye

01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:48.400
- Well what's the game today??
- Tug of War.

01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:52.000
I hope you've recovered,
don't look so miserable

01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:53.920
you were
sorely provoked.

01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:55.601
Who's going to
play this game?

01:41:56.001 --> 01:41:57.760
The good and
the evil.

01:41:58.040 --> 01:41:59.599
Who's good
and who's evil?

01:41:59.599 --> 01:42:01.220
It depends on
how you look at it.

01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:02.880
What are they
playing for?

01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:06.080
Me and what's left
of my reputation.

01:42:06.199 --> 01:42:08.160
The man or
the coroner?

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:11.921
Both, if they
win I give in.

01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:13.521
If who wins?

01:42:20.121 --> 01:42:22.880
Oh god Madgett
did you invite them?

01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:31.120
They have a nose
for funerals.

01:42:31.279 --> 01:42:33.200
There are
seven of them.

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:35.440
Then we
can't complain.

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.320
Madgett what
are you up to?

01:42:38.983 --> 01:42:40.021
Well...

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:42.000
They ought to be
here didn't they?

01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:45.840
You don't want to be accused
of secret burials do you?

01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:50.000
and since there are obviously
no rewards for me helping you

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.320
I thought enough
was enough.

01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:57.280
I've arranged to let the outcome
hang on a game of wit and strength.

01:42:57.440 --> 01:42:59.960
Come on Madgett you'll
never get them to play.

01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:02.480
If the stakes are
high enough they will.

01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:05.320
Madgett we're not
letting you go that easily.

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:06.640
Letting me go?

01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:10.041
If I go, you go too.

01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:12.240
those are
the stakes.

01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:15.040
Madgett we won't
party to this.

01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:17.360
Your game playing
is your business.

01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:21.240
We're not playing games anymore I've had
enough of game playing this is serious.

01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:24.560
and besides you're better
playing games than I am.

01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:27.041
This game is
very dangerous.

01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:29.960
I told you, all games
are dangerous.

01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:33.880
What games? I thought we
were here burying ashes.

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:35.920
I see you've got the
grave digger with you.

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:39.400
Sid's going to row the boat, that's
all. The ashes are going on the river.

01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:40.840
A nice provocative gesture.

01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:45.600
We thought as a fitting
send off we'd play a game.

01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:47.040
- A game?
- What sort of game?

01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:48.920
Watch him, he's always
playing games.

01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:50.801
Don't worry Nancy
we'll look after you.

01:43:50.801 --> 01:43:52.681
- Watch what you're saying to my sister!
- Shut up!

01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:56.180
- We felt we owed you an explanation.
- Shut up Madgett.

01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:59.880
An explanation? you owe us
more than a bloody explanation

01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:02.280
Alright, we'll play your game

01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:06.240
We'll win easily and then we'll wrap
the rope around your neck Madgett.

01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:11.040
If you win you'll get
your explanation.

01:44:11.905 --> 01:44:14.239
Right, come on

01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:21.840
<i>The game of Tug of War
is played with as many people</i>

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:24.200
<i>as there is room
for along the rope</i>

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:28.559
<i>the sides need to be evenly
matched with weight and strength </i>

01:44:28.559 --> 01:44:31.040
<i>to make it an
interesting contest.</i>

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:36.080
<i>At an agreed signal</i>

01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:40.000
<i>each team tries to pull the
other over an agreed mark</i>

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.680
<i>or space previously
decided on</i>

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:48.001
<i>Seven a side is an ideal number
of players for Tug of War</i>

01:45:15.681 --> 01:45:16.880
Quick in the boat

01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:18.360
We've won!

01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:23.880
Sid, Gregory,come on we've got
to get Madgett into the boat.

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:24.160
There's a storm
coming up Madgett.

01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:26.000
Can you swim?

01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:29.400
I thought not.

01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:40.400
The object of this game is to dare
to fall with a noose round your neck

01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:43.720
from a place officially high
enough off the ground

01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:46.160
such that the
fall will hang you.

01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:02.720
The object of the game
is to punish those

01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:05.280
who have caused
great unhappiness

01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:09.120
by their
selfish actions

01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:24.280
This is the best
game of all

01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:28.799
because the winner
is also the loser

01:47:29.079 --> 01:47:33.760
and the judges decision
is always final.

01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:49.720
What on earth is Smut
celebrating? We lost

01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:54.080
He arranged a little spectacle for
the scattering of the ashes.

01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:55.600
Thoughtfull boy.

01:50:04.281 --> 01:50:07.520
Well Madgett, how do you
feel about things now?

01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:11.000
Just the same

01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:14.120
As I said, we lost.

01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:16.720
I've had enough.

01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:21.480
Madgett, we haven't lost

01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:24.800
and there's no question
of any of us giving in.

01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:26.760
What are you
going to do?

01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:31.720
There's a storm coming up,
I thought I'd be prepared.

01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:35.640
Are you going to
undress to Madgett?

01:50:37.361 --> 01:50:40.040
That way we could make it
look like a proper accident.

01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:44.240
Now Madgett, off with your clothes,
it'll make it a neater ending.

01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:47.640
What an opportunity.
Alone on an open boat

01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:51.360
with the women you love
and an invitation to undress.

01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:00.320
Don't worry about Smut.
He'll be all right.

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:38.240
First, the
burial service.

01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:47.840
In loving memory
of a gardener.

01:51:53.081 --> 01:51:56.960
In loving memory
of a businessman.

01:52:10.239 --> 01:52:14.000
In loving memory of
an unemployed

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.600
non-swimmer.
