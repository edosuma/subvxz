00:07.037 --> 00:09.008
<i>Previously on</i> Penny Dreadful...

00:09.009 --> 00:11.061
You are aware, sir, of the extremity.

00:12.677 --> 00:13.668
We butcher 'em.

00:13.668 --> 00:15.520
I believe that's what I'm paying for.

00:16.974 --> 00:19.527
<i>And the men from your past who used you.</i>

00:19.552 --> 00:20.582
Will you forgive them?

00:20.583 --> 00:22.474
Would you have me forgive them?

00:24.507 --> 00:25.587
Ethan: <i>I'm not the man you knew.</i>

00:25.588 --> 00:26.950
There's blood on my teeth.

00:26.975 --> 00:29.382
Then you are the Apache I need.

00:29.642 --> 00:32.494
I intend to bring Mr.
Talbot to the appropriate

00:32.494 --> 00:33.754
representatives of your government.

00:33.779 --> 00:35.427
And how you gonna do that, Inspector?

00:35.428 --> 00:37.579
<i>The wolf is returning to his den.</i>

00:43.991 --> 00:45.131
How I've missed you.

00:45.548 --> 00:47.871
Can we render the beast dormant?

00:47.896 --> 00:49.200
Show me what you can do.

00:51.607 --> 00:54.509
<i>Mr. Balfour. Will you
not greet our guest?</i>

00:54.622 --> 00:56.988
I record my sessions for later review.

00:57.013 --> 00:58.473
These are for my ears only.

00:58.498 --> 01:00.409
If you believe the things I tell you,

01:00.434 --> 01:02.365
you'll never sleep quietly again.

01:02.390 --> 01:02.934
Tell me.

01:02.959 --> 01:05.730
<i>She has told her story.</i>

01:05.755 --> 01:07.231
Yes, Master.

01:07.357 --> 01:09.448
Kneel, child.

01:09.449 --> 01:12.848
<i>You will be flesh of my flesh...</i>

01:13.005 --> 01:15.077
<i>Blood of my blood.</i>

02:12.264 --> 02:13.745
Where?

02:13.871 --> 02:15.872
A stable of some sort.

02:16.035 --> 02:17.075
You're safe.

02:17.076 --> 02:18.276
The others?

02:18.277 --> 02:20.069
Not so safe.

03:00.441 --> 03:02.243
They'll be after me.

03:03.218 --> 03:04.348
I have to go.

03:04.349 --> 03:06.391
Where did you have in mind to go?

03:07.503 --> 03:08.553
You're not coming.

03:08.554 --> 03:09.585
Ethan...

03:12.478 --> 03:15.460
Has my utility not been
amply demonstrated?

03:15.461 --> 03:17.543
Has my allegiance not been proved?

03:18.217 --> 03:21.656
I followed you across an ocean
and across a continent.

03:21.657 --> 03:23.569
I will follow you to Hell.

03:24.520 --> 03:25.631
I'll lead the way...

03:27.443 --> 03:28.604
Wolf of God.

- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:28.524 --> 05:30.676
You sit there with your gramophone

05:31.080 --> 05:32.140
and your questions...

05:32.165 --> 05:33.007
judging me,

05:33.328 --> 05:35.046
refusing to believe me when I say...

05:35.071 --> 05:36.571
I know you!

05:36.596 --> 05:37.696
You have been my friend.

05:37.977 --> 05:38.784
- My ancestor, you mean.

05:38.785 --> 05:40.566
Joan Clayton. You!

05:40.977 --> 05:44.282
You're exactly like her...
without the kindness.

05:44.307 --> 05:45.448
- And the abortions.
- Stop it!

05:45.473 --> 05:47.363
Sit down, Vanessa.

05:47.388 --> 05:48.489
Do you believe me?

05:49.756 --> 05:51.767
What are you asking me to believe?

05:51.768 --> 05:54.549
That I'm a reincarnation
of your witch friend?

05:54.550 --> 05:55.781
That you are hunted by vampires?

05:55.782 --> 05:57.542
That you commune with Satan?

05:57.543 --> 05:59.532
Which part do you want me to believe?

06:02.608 --> 06:03.769
I believe all of it.

06:03.770 --> 06:05.751
No. You believe I believe it.

06:05.752 --> 06:07.562
There's no difference to me.

06:07.587 --> 06:09.024
Sit down, Vanessa, please.

06:13.669 --> 06:16.631
Such a subject I am for you.

06:16.632 --> 06:17.813
So full of neurosis.

06:17.814 --> 06:20.625
No, Miss, so full of pain.

06:20.626 --> 06:21.747
All of which is true.

06:21.748 --> 06:23.839
You manifest it in any number of ways

06:23.840 --> 06:25.640
so you can make sense of it.

06:25.641 --> 06:26.792
But it's inexplicable.

06:26.793 --> 06:29.644
So the mind creates order around it.

06:29.645 --> 06:31.646
Phantoms, villains, demons.

06:31.647 --> 06:33.839
Those things we understand and can name.

06:33.840 --> 06:36.671
But there is no name for it, Vanessa.

06:36.672 --> 06:38.603
It is a dark root without a name,

06:38.604 --> 06:39.715
from which grows illness.

06:39.716 --> 06:41.657
- And delusion?
- Yes.

06:48.775 --> 06:50.616
May I have a cigarette?

06:57.724 --> 06:59.654
Let go of me!

06:59.655 --> 07:01.637
Miss Ives! Release my hand!

07:08.674 --> 07:12.658
Through your skin... to your bones...

07:13.720 --> 07:16.682
crawling like the scorpion...

07:16.683 --> 07:18.785
up, reaching.

07:20.837 --> 07:23.629
You have a scar on the
back of your neck.

07:23.820 --> 07:25.641
Blood!

07:28.664 --> 07:30.856
There are tram cars outside the window.

07:30.857 --> 07:32.648
A city!

07:32.879 --> 07:34.670
More blood!

07:36.753 --> 07:38.634
You were hurt by a man.

07:39.655 --> 07:40.787
He would have killed you...

07:42.889 --> 07:45.671
Had you not killed him first.

07:53.397 --> 07:55.489
Such things have a name.

07:56.384 --> 07:57.784
They are witches.

07:57.784 --> 07:59.805
They are vampires. They are Lucifer.

07:59.806 --> 08:02.799
They are all those things which
walk in your nightmares.

08:05.692 --> 08:06.823
Shall we walk together?

08:46.753 --> 08:48.845
- New to the city, are you?
- What?

08:49.896 --> 08:50.907
No.

08:51.828 --> 08:53.839
I got on at Dumfries.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.942
So you're from further north, I take it?

08:58.233 --> 08:59.244
Very.

09:01.523 --> 09:02.524
You have family here?

09:07.924 --> 09:08.965
Yes.

09:29.826 --> 09:30.877
And...

09:31.838 --> 09:32.939
you've no memory of it?

09:34.677 --> 09:36.689
Like a ghost walked through the room...

09:37.884 --> 09:39.835
No more.

09:39.836 --> 09:42.758
An apparition of memory, I have.

09:42.759 --> 09:44.831
You were quite deranged.

09:46.306 --> 09:49.229
And violent, they tell me.
Lean back, old man.

09:50.949 --> 09:53.180
'Tis my teeth he fears.

09:56.118 --> 09:59.110
And when your madness has returned,

09:59.111 --> 10:01.152
do you remember this state?

10:01.153 --> 10:02.223
Being sane?

10:02.224 --> 10:04.006
Not terribly.

10:06.520 --> 10:07.691
And isn't that the pity of it?

10:36.504 --> 10:38.535
Aye, there's the tragedy of it.

10:38.779 --> 10:40.700
The serum only lasts a matter of hours.

10:40.725 --> 10:41.745
And then they revert.

10:42.034 --> 10:44.095
- The beast will out.
- And which is true?

10:44.471 --> 10:46.663
Which is the real man,
the beast or the angel?

10:47.249 --> 10:49.150
- We are both.
- Are we?

10:49.151 --> 10:52.043
"Good and evil, braided be."

10:52.044 --> 10:53.214
Oh, no.

10:53.215 --> 10:55.097
Not at all.

10:55.777 --> 10:56.927
Or at least...

10:56.952 --> 10:59.805
we can't seem to be that way.

11:00.232 --> 11:02.144
So complicated, I mean.

11:02.917 --> 11:04.758
In the end,

11:04.783 --> 11:07.524
we must be that thing the
world demands of us.

11:08.130 --> 11:09.300
We must take the lust

11:09.301 --> 11:11.292
and the avarice and the ambition

11:11.293 --> 11:13.204
and bury them.

11:13.205 --> 11:15.086
All the alien, ugly things!

11:15.087 --> 11:16.267
All the things we really are!

11:16.268 --> 11:18.079
The other one! The other man!

11:18.080 --> 11:20.131
We cannot allow him!

11:26.248 --> 11:28.310
Steel yourself for the
work ahead, Henry.

11:29.991 --> 11:31.081
If you cannot endure the nightmare,

11:31.106 --> 11:32.146
you should not lie down for the sleep.

11:32.171 --> 11:33.191
I can endure it!

11:33.216 --> 11:35.047
I have endured it my whole life!

11:35.072 --> 11:37.253
Good, for I think I can help.

11:37.299 --> 11:39.061
With what?

11:39.895 --> 11:41.856
The regression.

11:41.881 --> 11:43.852
I believe I can increase the
duration of the change,

11:43.877 --> 11:45.828
perhaps even render it permanent.

11:45.853 --> 11:47.013
I have been working on
this for years now.

11:47.038 --> 11:48.068
Believe me, there's no way to...

11:48.093 --> 11:51.843
No. You couldn't do it. But I can.

11:53.075 --> 11:56.018
You were always myopic when
it came to your discipline.

11:56.895 --> 11:58.847
We need not live on the fulcrum.

11:59.908 --> 12:01.920
We can be angel or beast fully.

12:04.052 --> 12:05.913
I can make that happen.

12:05.914 --> 12:06.944
How?

12:06.945 --> 12:08.987
Electricity has unlocked
her secrets to me.

12:11.476 --> 12:13.408
By combining your work with mine...

12:14.807 --> 12:16.779
we'll create a choir of angels.

12:19.027 --> 12:20.859
One in particular.

12:33.942 --> 12:35.914
I almost feel sorry for them.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.106
So predictable in their fascinations.

12:39.107 --> 12:43.121
All men are utter slaves
to their desires.

12:44.022 --> 12:45.083
Even Dorian?

12:46.004 --> 12:48.986
Dorian is an exceptional creature.

12:48.987 --> 12:50.087
He's a man.

12:50.088 --> 12:51.870
But unlike all others.

12:53.872 --> 12:55.002
I've never known a man
who didn't want to

12:55.003 --> 12:56.154
fuck me or beat me.

12:57.906 --> 12:59.077
Can you say different?

13:03.942 --> 13:05.063
Well, I knew one.

13:07.906 --> 13:08.936
A time ago, this was.

13:08.937 --> 13:10.899
An American, in fact. He was different.

13:11.900 --> 13:12.911
What happened to him?

13:15.133 --> 13:17.035
It's more what happened to me.

13:19.017 --> 13:22.040
Eventful... has my life been.

13:23.992 --> 13:25.092
One day, perhaps.

13:25.093 --> 13:26.174
Tell me.

13:28.146 --> 13:29.967
I am yours.

13:29.968 --> 13:31.039
Tell me.

13:32.020 --> 13:35.152
Join us! Join us, sisters!

13:35.153 --> 13:37.044
Votes for women.

13:37.045 --> 13:38.916
Rise up!

13:38.917 --> 13:41.138
Ladies and sisters, rise up!

13:41.139 --> 13:42.199
Rise up!

13:42.200 --> 13:44.181
I'm asking you to disperse.

13:44.182 --> 13:46.944
Rise up for equality!

13:46.945 --> 13:48.086
Votes for women!

13:50.929 --> 13:52.981
We have the right, sir!

13:53.131 --> 13:54.992
Get away!

13:59.958 --> 14:02.049
They think as you do, the suffragettes.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.110
No.

14:03.111 --> 14:06.083
Our enemies are the same
but they seek equality.

14:06.084 --> 14:07.095
And we?

14:08.226 --> 14:10.008
Mastery.

14:11.219 --> 14:14.962
And they're all so awfully clamorous.

14:14.963 --> 14:17.084
All this marching around in public

14:17.085 --> 14:18.185
and waving placards.

14:18.186 --> 14:19.988
That's not it.

14:23.211 --> 14:26.955
How do you accomplish
anything in this life?

14:29.205 --> 14:30.276
By craft.

14:32.178 --> 14:33.249
By stealth.

14:34.150 --> 14:35.161
By poison.

14:36.172 --> 14:41.127
By the throat quietly slit
in the dead of the night.

14:42.218 --> 14:45.260
By the careful and silent...

14:45.261 --> 14:48.144
accumulation of power.

14:49.175 --> 14:51.206
And when you have that power?

14:51.207 --> 14:54.080
Well, what do you do when
you've assembled an army?

14:56.142 --> 14:57.263
You go to war.

15:25.331 --> 15:27.283
Don't you think it's time you told me?

15:30.186 --> 15:31.246
Told you what?

15:31.247 --> 15:33.368
You could have tracked
Ethan here yourself.

15:33.369 --> 15:36.152
Why'd you cross half
the world to find me?

15:37.323 --> 15:40.125
Because Ethan trusts you with his life.

15:40.126 --> 15:41.297
Does he not trust you?

15:44.120 --> 15:45.131
Why?

15:46.282 --> 15:47.283
Why?

15:48.324 --> 15:51.186
A woman, like a demon.

15:51.187 --> 15:54.320
Branded and deeply scarred.
Speaking in tongues.

15:56.252 --> 15:58.204
This means something to you.

16:01.247 --> 16:02.268
She's a witch.

16:03.409 --> 16:05.341
A servant of the devil.

16:06.252 --> 16:08.193
Kaetenay: She's with Ethan now.

16:08.194 --> 16:10.235
We must find him.

16:10.236 --> 16:13.328
We must slaughter anyone
who stands in our way.

16:13.329 --> 16:18.143
If we cannot save our son,
a terrible end awaits us.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.195
All of us.

16:20.336 --> 16:22.327
The beast will feed.

16:22.328 --> 16:25.280
The darkness will overcome the Earth.

16:25.281 --> 16:28.243
And all our days will come to an end.

16:28.244 --> 16:30.245
Only Ethan can save us.

16:30.246 --> 16:32.177
He has been chosen.

16:32.178 --> 16:33.359
How do you know this?

16:35.441 --> 16:37.263
I have seen it.

16:45.441 --> 16:48.223
This car is for whites.

16:48.224 --> 16:49.455
Indians and niggers go back.

16:52.318 --> 16:54.319
Get your filthy ass up and out.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.380
This gentleman's with me.

16:55.381 --> 16:59.214
"Gentleman"? Indians
travel with the livestock.

16:59.215 --> 17:00.395
That's the goddamn law here, friend.

17:00.396 --> 17:03.188
Before you speak another word...

17:03.189 --> 17:04.400
I ask you to consider this...

17:06.301 --> 17:08.403
How valuable is your life?

17:08.404 --> 17:10.415
Do you hold it dear?

17:11.257 --> 17:13.358
Does your wife value your company?

17:15.290 --> 17:18.282
Do you favor growing
old to one day teach

17:18.284 --> 17:21.257
your ugly inbred children
your grotesque manners?

17:22.288 --> 17:24.249
Lay hands on him...

17:24.250 --> 17:25.351
that'll be your end.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.511
That desert is three days across.

18:17.293 --> 18:18.354
That is, if our horses survive.

18:19.445 --> 18:21.457
- They die, we die.
- That won't happen.

18:23.499 --> 18:26.311
Let me tell you something
about life out here.

18:26.312 --> 18:28.453
There is no mercy, anywhere.

18:28.454 --> 18:30.435
Look around...

18:30.436 --> 18:31.556
none.

18:31.557 --> 18:33.559
Not in the land and not in me.

18:34.540 --> 18:37.532
I hate every square inch of it...

18:37.533 --> 18:40.336
and I hate you only slightly less.

18:42.368 --> 18:44.310
Yet you know I'm here for a reason.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.433
You can't fathom it quite,
but you know it's true.

18:53.349 --> 18:54.410
My father...

18:56.402 --> 18:57.533
My Apache father...

18:59.375 --> 19:00.415
taught me to believe in things

19:00.416 --> 19:02.348
beyond what we think we understand.

19:04.450 --> 19:06.342
And you are surely one of them.

19:10.376 --> 19:11.507
Then we best acquire our horses.

19:18.514 --> 19:20.355
Quiet, boy.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.361
Hold it!

19:26.332 --> 19:27.502
Step back now.

19:27.503 --> 19:30.415
Sir, I'm so sorry. Allow me to explain.

19:31.417 --> 19:32.557
You don't have to explain
a goddamn thing.

19:32.558 --> 19:34.459
This isn't what it appears.

19:34.460 --> 19:36.371
We're not thieves.

19:36.372 --> 19:38.353
Tell him to step away from the horses.

19:38.354 --> 19:39.425
You'll note my accent.

19:40.386 --> 19:41.586
You see, I'm from England.

19:41.587 --> 19:44.369
I've always wanted to see
an actual Western ranch.

19:44.370 --> 19:45.570
- Thus we found ourselves...
- Robert?

19:45.571 --> 19:47.383
No!

20:05.551 --> 20:07.393
What's done is done.

20:10.596 --> 20:12.617
Because I murder with will
and not like a blind animal,

20:12.618 --> 20:14.510
you think me a monster.

20:15.511 --> 20:17.573
How many corpses have you
left in your wake, Ethan?

20:20.486 --> 20:22.397
When there are bodies stretched

20:22.398 --> 20:23.628
from here to the horizon,

20:23.629 --> 20:27.392
and you can walk across them
without touching the ground,

20:27.393 --> 20:28.484
then you can weep.

21:31.457 --> 21:32.578
What do you see?

21:41.567 --> 21:43.729
Neck broken, pretty clean.

21:43.730 --> 21:45.691
The rest of them shredded
and cannibalized.

21:45.692 --> 21:48.503
- This one neatly killed.
- Suggesting?

21:48.504 --> 21:49.696
He had help.

21:53.569 --> 21:56.532
Perhaps Mr. Talbot...

21:57.503 --> 21:58.504
isn't alone.

21:59.565 --> 22:00.746
What aren't you telling me?

22:00.747 --> 22:02.517
I don't know what you mean, Marshal.

22:02.518 --> 22:04.599
You chase this son of a
bitch from London to here

22:04.600 --> 22:05.751
in the middle of the Devil's asshole

22:05.752 --> 22:07.573
because it's your duty?

22:09.605 --> 22:10.666
Precisely.

22:42.759 --> 22:45.732
I think there's more to Mr.
Talbot than meets the eye.

22:47.824 --> 22:49.796
Do you believe in the occult, Marshal?

22:51.537 --> 22:52.598
No.

22:53.649 --> 22:54.781
You should start.

23:47.884 --> 23:50.746
Sorry I'm late.

23:50.747 --> 23:53.689
I couldn't find one for love
or money, a cab, that is.

23:53.690 --> 23:55.791
And then we had the trickiest
situation with an Arctic bear.

23:55.792 --> 23:57.753
Not an Arctic bear!

23:57.754 --> 23:59.745
I'm afraid so.

23:59.746 --> 24:01.778
Thank you for meeting me. Shall we walk?

24:45.712 --> 24:47.823
Excuse me. May I ask something?

24:47.824 --> 24:50.696
Can you tell me who lives upstairs?

24:50.697 --> 24:52.708
The first floor, right above this room.

24:52.709 --> 24:54.700
No one lives there.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.732
Who lived there previously, then?

24:56.733 --> 24:59.785
I wasn't here. Always
been empty since I come.

24:59.786 --> 25:00.937
Could I see it?

25:06.813 --> 25:08.844
Yours for three shillings a week.

25:08.845 --> 25:11.708
A month in advance. No meals.

25:29.806 --> 25:30.936
Is there anyone who might know

25:30.937 --> 25:32.739
who lived here before?

25:33.770 --> 25:35.781
Where they are now, I mean.

25:35.782 --> 25:36.863
How would I know?

25:37.844 --> 25:39.765
Well, perhaps they left
a forwarding address...

25:39.766 --> 25:40.806
Look, friend,

25:40.807 --> 25:42.839
are you interested in taking
the bloody flat or not?

25:44.751 --> 25:46.772
I'm interested in finding

25:46.773 --> 25:47.954
the people who lived here.

25:50.897 --> 25:52.838
And you often come to Limehouse?

25:52.839 --> 25:54.800
No. Never been here before,

25:54.801 --> 25:55.812
but...

25:56.753 --> 25:59.885
Well, I'm in mind to try
new things these days.

25:59.886 --> 26:01.987
Adventuring with Captain Nemo?

26:01.988 --> 26:03.789
Not battling sea creatures

26:03.790 --> 26:06.842
or sinking frigates,
exactly, but still...

26:06.843 --> 26:07.894
New horizons.

26:09.756 --> 26:10.857
I had a wife, you see.

26:12.789 --> 26:14.791
She passed away just over a year ago.

26:16.753 --> 26:18.885
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

26:20.026 --> 26:22.849
So, I'm just finding my feet again.

26:23.770 --> 26:24.831
You understand?

26:25.922 --> 26:26.963
I do.

26:29.876 --> 26:31.897
I want you to know...

26:31.898 --> 26:33.769
When I saw you at the lecture,

26:33.770 --> 26:34.871
I thought of her.

26:35.802 --> 26:36.943
And what she'd want for me.

26:39.025 --> 26:42.829
I hear her voice in the house, still.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.952
She had a very soft voice...

26:46.883 --> 26:47.974
like a little bell.

26:53.810 --> 26:55.001
I'm very sorry for your loss.

27:00.877 --> 27:01.907
So...

27:01.908 --> 27:04.861
this is life again.

27:05.001 --> 27:06.953
I've barely seen it for the past year...

27:07.894 --> 27:09.896
especially in such abundance.

27:11.798 --> 27:12.999
I've been somewhat the same.

27:13.990 --> 27:15.031
Healing, in a way.

27:15.972 --> 27:17.913
Trying new things,

27:17.914 --> 27:20.886
dipping a toe into what
this world offers.

27:20.887 --> 27:21.958
And how do you find it?

27:23.810 --> 27:24.861
Promising.

30:52.178 --> 30:53.219
Mother?

31:02.098 --> 31:05.030
Jack, darling, how are you?

31:05.031 --> 31:07.242
I'm well. Had a bit of a cough before.

31:07.243 --> 31:10.045
Just finished my reading and lettering.

31:10.046 --> 31:11.246
Marjorie: Oh, you're a good boy.

31:11.247 --> 31:13.218
Tell me about your reading, won't you?

31:13.219 --> 31:14.329
Alan Breck and David

31:14.330 --> 31:16.312
continue their escape
across the heather.

31:17.243 --> 31:20.285
Had a terrific row,
though, and are at odds.

31:20.286 --> 31:23.148
I thought they were
going to fight, even,

31:23.149 --> 31:24.210
with their swords.

31:49.115 --> 31:50.255
Shall we?

31:50.256 --> 31:51.842
That bold I'm not.

31:51.867 --> 31:53.363
I doubt that.

31:56.102 --> 31:58.233
A glimpse of things to come perhaps?

31:58.234 --> 32:00.245
Do you want to know the future?

32:00.246 --> 32:02.368
No, not really. Where's the fun in that?

32:05.351 --> 32:08.224
That's more the thing. What do you say?

32:09.235 --> 32:11.366
I'm not overly fond of mirrors.

32:11.367 --> 32:14.210
That's absurd, you're so beautiful.

32:26.112 --> 32:29.134
Oh, look at this one. Look at this one.

32:33.139 --> 32:34.270
Oh, shall we go back here?

32:49.405 --> 32:51.326
<i>I don't like seeing myself.</i>

32:51.327 --> 32:53.159
Come on.

33:44.310 --> 33:46.341
Lady, lady, pudding and pie,

33:46.342 --> 33:49.244
what do I spy with my little eye?

33:49.245 --> 33:51.466
Cakes and ale and all tasty treats.

33:51.467 --> 33:55.220
After we've had our juicy red meats.

33:57.383 --> 33:58.474
Where is your master?

34:00.216 --> 34:03.249
Soon, my lady, my lady,
my pudding and pie...

34:03.469 --> 34:05.291
you'll meet him again.

34:06.502 --> 34:09.324
Again? Old friends, you and he.

34:09.475 --> 34:11.387
Bosom companions, like.

34:12.478 --> 34:14.350
Don't you remember, my lady?

34:16.452 --> 34:18.464
In the white room.

34:19.445 --> 34:21.386
Just you and he...

34:21.387 --> 34:23.408
and that other.

34:23.409 --> 34:26.282
His teeth were at your throat.

34:31.467 --> 34:33.329
When was this?

34:35.420 --> 34:37.243
When was this?

34:37.382 --> 34:38.464
Long ago.

34:39.445 --> 34:42.368
In the white room where
there was no time.

34:43.359 --> 34:46.262
No day and no night.

34:47.402 --> 34:50.346
Surely you remember, my lady, my lady?

35:09.684 --> 35:10.785
There's a woman inside.

35:11.457 --> 35:13.379
Dead? Mmm.

35:14.420 --> 35:17.322
He scavenged the house for supplies.

35:17.323 --> 35:18.363
Took the horses.

35:18.364 --> 35:20.385
He's not a killer.

35:20.386 --> 35:22.407
Not like this, I mean.

35:22.549 --> 35:24.591
- His throat was cut.
- And the woman?

35:25.421 --> 35:26.472
Worse.

35:27.543 --> 35:31.307
The Ethan Chandler I know is
not a cold-blooded murderer.

35:31.497 --> 35:33.508
We are losing him, Malcolm.

35:33.509 --> 35:35.331
He is halfway damned already.

35:38.454 --> 35:39.565
We should bury them.

35:40.576 --> 35:42.467
Let the coyotes eat.

35:42.468 --> 35:44.349
We go into the desert now.

35:44.350 --> 35:46.351
We do not stop until we find him.

35:46.352 --> 35:47.533
And when we find him?

35:49.325 --> 35:50.466
We save him if we can.

35:51.547 --> 35:53.349
If we cannot...

35:54.330 --> 35:56.322
we kill the evil he has become.

36:16.372 --> 36:18.503
Once we go into the
desert, we don't stop.

36:18.504 --> 36:20.545
We rest the horses some
at night, that's it.

36:20.546 --> 36:21.587
And then?

36:23.439 --> 36:25.390
My father.

36:25.391 --> 36:26.501
A homecoming, is it?

36:26.502 --> 36:28.393
I so look forward to
meeting your father.

36:28.394 --> 36:29.515
All right, enough.

36:32.578 --> 36:33.629
Why are you here?

36:36.582 --> 36:38.574
I want to liberate your truest self...

36:40.606 --> 36:42.628
The beast that prowls around your heart.

36:44.550 --> 36:47.392
And when you are truly yourself,

36:47.393 --> 36:48.624
and we are painted with blood,

36:50.416 --> 36:52.508
I want to rule the
darkness at your side.

36:55.611 --> 36:57.523
What if I don't want anyone at my side?

36:58.394 --> 36:59.545
You know you do.

37:01.447 --> 37:02.537
Only not that melancholy Miss Ives.

37:02.538 --> 37:03.670
Don't you speak her name.

37:23.609 --> 37:26.451
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

37:26.452 --> 37:27.553
Hold your fire!

37:29.585 --> 37:30.666
He's with a woman.

37:31.607 --> 37:32.709
The plot thickens.

37:33.680 --> 37:35.660
I would prefer to take him alive.

37:35.661 --> 37:37.642
Then you should get a
fucking gun and help us.

37:37.643 --> 37:41.526
Scotland Yard inspectors
do not carry firearms.

37:41.527 --> 37:43.608
Oh, you'll do great here in the West.

37:43.609 --> 37:45.520
Come on! After them!

37:45.521 --> 37:46.581
Get about it!

38:07.523 --> 38:08.735
Dr. Sweet: Vanessa, please tell me.

38:10.697 --> 38:12.657
What happened in there?

38:12.658 --> 38:14.510
It's like you saw a ghost.

38:19.615 --> 38:20.727
Tell me what happened.

38:24.671 --> 38:26.472
Dr. Sweet...

38:27.734 --> 38:29.535
I'm so sorry.

38:30.717 --> 38:33.710
I've enjoyed every moment
we've spent together.

38:34.741 --> 38:37.532
More than I thought I could.

38:37.533 --> 38:38.675
But it's impossible.

38:40.516 --> 38:41.586
You're looking at a man

38:41.587 --> 38:43.639
who faces the impossible every day.

38:44.620 --> 38:46.782
Monkeys that walk upright like men.

38:46.783 --> 38:49.604
Whales with tusks as long as sabers.

38:49.605 --> 38:51.546
If there's one thing I know,

38:51.547 --> 38:53.670
it's that nothing's impossible.

38:59.776 --> 39:01.507
It's too dangerous.

39:05.651 --> 39:07.613
Take it as a sign of something...

39:08.644 --> 39:09.696
like love.

39:12.528 --> 39:13.539
Goodbye.

40:07.407 --> 40:08.408
In the Dark Ages...

40:09.676 --> 40:10.847
in certain parts of Europe...

40:12.779 --> 40:16.652
novitiate nuns were asked to
pledge themselves to God...

40:16.853 --> 40:18.634
in blood.

40:19.686 --> 40:21.586
They would cut off their own breasts

40:21.587 --> 40:23.699
and make them an offering
to the Almighty...

40:23.700 --> 40:25.731
Much as soldiers in ancient Rome

40:25.732 --> 40:27.874
would have to prove themselves
by killing an enemy.

40:29.686 --> 40:31.707
You were not a Legionnaire

40:31.708 --> 40:33.820
unless painted with blood.

40:37.653 --> 40:40.867
We're all tested in one way
or another, are we not?

40:48.775 --> 40:49.796
You recognize this man?

40:50.887 --> 40:52.858
He bought me when I was 12.

40:52.859 --> 40:54.640
Then?

40:56.622 --> 40:58.725
He used me as his pet whore for a time.

40:59.896 --> 41:01.748
Like a monkey on a chain.

41:03.810 --> 41:05.701
When I got older, he grew tired of me

41:05.702 --> 41:06.793
and whored me out.

41:08.644 --> 41:10.655
Set me up on a platform
and let them fuck me

41:10.656 --> 41:11.798
10 at a time.

41:12.819 --> 41:14.740
Gave me to the sailors and the Chinks

41:14.741 --> 41:15.882
and the Lascars, finally.

41:16.723 --> 41:19.756
And then charged us £20 to
see you tortured and killed.

41:21.728 --> 41:23.920
That's £20 total, mind you. £10 each.

41:24.911 --> 41:26.753
That is your worth.

41:41.678 --> 41:43.719
Know what you do, Justine.

41:43.720 --> 41:45.682
Such a thing is a pledge.

41:46.793 --> 41:48.694
It can never be drawn back.

41:48.695 --> 41:49.926
You can never be innocent again.

41:50.827 --> 41:52.718
God will turn His back.

41:52.719 --> 41:54.901
Mankind will shun you.

41:55.752 --> 41:57.714
Murderess. Whore.

43:59.976 --> 44:02.809
Dr. Sweet: You approached her.

44:03.990 --> 44:05.060
I did nothing.

44:05.061 --> 44:07.884
You spoke to her.

44:08.825 --> 44:09.925
She is mine!

44:17.954 --> 44:20.106
When the time is right, my flesh.

44:23.029 --> 44:27.466
When she is abject.
When she is helpless.

44:28.733 --> 44:30.365
When she begs for me.

44:32.008 --> 44:33.099
Then!

44:36.032 --> 44:38.044
We will have her.

44:45.892 --> 44:46.972
Feed.

46:26.487 --> 46:30.491
To build an empire, you start
with a single soldier.

46:31.471 --> 46:34.544
Or a religion, with a single worshipper.

46:36.092 --> 46:37.223
And which are we?

46:39.195 --> 46:41.177
You're our first, Justine.

46:42.999 --> 46:44.120
There will be more.

46:45.141 --> 46:46.241
You shall help us find them

46:46.242 --> 46:49.084
and bring them to our great enterprise.

46:49.085 --> 46:51.217
An army we'll build.

46:52.158 --> 46:54.220
Whores and fallen women.

46:55.161 --> 46:58.123
The disgraced and the powerless.

46:58.124 --> 46:59.234
The shunned and hated.

46:59.235 --> 47:04.079
All those invisible women

47:04.080 --> 47:06.272
who move unseen through this great city.

47:08.034 --> 47:09.245
Our soldiers.

47:11.047 --> 47:12.108
And then?

47:12.999 --> 47:14.039
Power.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.191
No man's pet.

47:16.092 --> 47:17.242
Revolution.

47:17.243 --> 47:18.204
Freedom.

47:25.011 --> 47:27.242
Liberty is a bitch

47:27.243 --> 47:30.276
who must be bedded on a
mattress of corpses.

47:54.140 --> 47:56.081
I know what I'm asking.

47:56.082 --> 47:57.142
I don't think you do.

47:57.143 --> 47:59.324
Hypnotism is a very
new therapeutic tool.

47:59.325 --> 48:01.046
It can be effective,

48:01.047 --> 48:02.338
but it can also be extremely traumatic.

48:03.269 --> 48:05.081
Can I be more traumatized?

48:06.052 --> 48:07.964
You absurd woman. Vanessa, hold on.

48:08.505 --> 48:09.555
Why do you think he was

48:09.556 --> 48:10.616
talking about the Banning Clinic?

48:10.617 --> 48:13.599
The white room with no day or
night can only be one place.

48:13.600 --> 48:15.411
The cell I was kept in.

48:15.412 --> 48:16.452
According to the records,

48:16.453 --> 48:19.445
Dr. Banning attempted to treat you with
hydrotherapy and psychotropic drugs.

48:19.446 --> 48:20.476
He tortured me.

48:20.477 --> 48:22.458
He also performed brain surgery.

48:22.459 --> 48:23.559
You were trephined.

48:23.560 --> 48:26.473
This has to be the room where
I met the Master in the past!

48:28.555 --> 48:29.596
Help me.

48:30.487 --> 48:34.490
Uncovered memories are sometimes
suppressed for a reason.

48:34.491 --> 48:38.404
The mind protects itself from
what it doesn't want to know,

48:38.405 --> 48:40.396
the castle pulling up the drawbridge.

48:40.397 --> 48:41.667
We would be lowering the bridge.

48:41.668 --> 48:43.409
Anything.

48:43.410 --> 48:45.581
The emotions can be very
raw, I'm warning you.

48:45.582 --> 48:46.692
You're willing to give
yourself over to this,

48:46.693 --> 48:48.565
- no matter what may come...
- Now.

48:54.631 --> 48:56.573
It's not like the music hall acts.

48:58.505 --> 49:00.626
Not everyone can be hypnotized

49:00.627 --> 49:02.709
and you still have full free will.

49:03.680 --> 49:05.612
I can't make you do anything...

49:06.503 --> 49:09.526
nor will you behave in any
way outside your character.

49:11.478 --> 49:12.529
You must allow it.

49:13.470 --> 49:15.472
I can only facilitate your journey.

49:17.494 --> 49:19.725
It's like going to sleep
for a while, nothing else.

49:19.726 --> 49:21.527
Will I remember?

49:21.528 --> 49:23.500
Like you remember a dream, mostly.

49:24.531 --> 49:27.654
Now, shut your eyes and
listen to the gramophone.

49:30.657 --> 49:32.688
Do you hear the stylus
cutting into the wax?

49:32.689 --> 49:33.739
Yes.

49:33.740 --> 49:36.673
Concentrate on that
sound and nothing else.

49:42.639 --> 49:43.720
Listen to it.

49:57.320 --> 49:59.626
Do you remember your room
at the Banning Clinic?

50:01.074 --> 50:02.769
- Yes.
- Tell me about it.

50:04.370 --> 50:06.311
It was small and padded.

50:06.429 --> 50:07.639
What was in it?

50:07.664 --> 50:09.656
Move your eyes around the room.

50:13.490 --> 50:16.493
There's a small bed and chamber pot.

50:17.544 --> 50:18.655
A plain chair in the corner.

50:21.778 --> 50:23.610
No windows.

50:23.750 --> 50:25.732
There are gaslights covered with mesh.

50:29.626 --> 50:30.747
There's a metal door.

50:31.248 --> 50:33.010
Let your eyes move over the door.

50:33.035 --> 50:34.897
What do you see?

50:36.673 --> 50:37.714
It's clean metal.

50:39.277 --> 50:41.240
There are rounded rivets along the edge.

50:42.679 --> 50:45.542
<i>There's a patina to the door...</i>

50:46.523 --> 50:47.574
<i>a bit green, even.</i>

50:50.747 --> 50:51.798
Are you alone?

50:53.800 --> 50:55.561
Always.

50:55.562 --> 50:56.702
No one comes in?

50:56.703 --> 50:59.675
The intendants to take me for treatment

50:59.676 --> 51:02.568
and an orderly with the food.

51:21.788 --> 51:23.760
I've brought your food, Miss Ives.
