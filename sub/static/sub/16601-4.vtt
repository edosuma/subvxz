WEBVTT

00:02.351 --> 00:04.693
Okay, okay, everybody.

00:04.694 --> 00:06.994
Listen, respect.
Respect.

00:06.996 --> 00:09.096
We know everybody's got
some serious questions.

00:09.098 --> 00:10.598
We have the
commissioner here

00:10.600 --> 00:13.000
who doesn't have a lot
of time, but since

00:13.002 --> 00:14.535
I have the mike,
let me start this off

00:14.537 --> 00:15.603
with the first question.

00:15.605 --> 00:18.072
Commissioner, about
a month ago, your guys

00:18.074 --> 00:20.775
came through here
in a so-called gang sweep

00:20.777 --> 00:23.778
and picked up over
100 of our youth.

00:23.780 --> 00:25.579
What's up with that?

00:25.581 --> 00:27.581
The Bitterman Houses
had a half a dozen

00:27.583 --> 00:29.750
gang-related shootings
in that period.

00:29.752 --> 00:31.719
Would you prefer that we just

00:31.721 --> 00:34.088
sat back and let them
pick each other off?

00:34.090 --> 00:35.089
Everybody picked up

00:35.091 --> 00:37.191
was not gang-related,

00:37.193 --> 00:39.693
<i>nor</i> involved in the shooting.

00:39.695 --> 00:40.828
But those few have since

00:40.830 --> 00:42.029
been released, as you know.

00:42.031 --> 00:43.297
But isn't this like

00:43.299 --> 00:45.032
stop-and-frisk?
- That's right!

00:45.034 --> 00:48.068
It's like you're just dropping a
net and picking up everybody.

00:48.070 --> 00:49.670
Number one,
we have probable cause

00:49.672 --> 00:50.671
for all those arrests.

00:50.673 --> 00:54.074
Number two,
there is a long history

00:54.076 --> 00:56.043
of gang violence
in these housing projects.

00:56.045 --> 00:57.678
The low point

00:57.680 --> 00:59.113
being when our mayor

00:59.115 --> 01:01.782
was carried out of a meeting--
just like this one--

01:01.784 --> 01:03.384
with a bullet in his spine.

01:03.386 --> 01:05.986
We've got our own wounded

01:05.988 --> 01:07.822
and casualties here as well.

01:07.824 --> 01:10.157
Look at Kim over here.

01:10.159 --> 01:12.860
Jamael, Boostie.
Please. Look at them.

01:12.862 --> 01:14.128
We have got to start

01:14.130 --> 01:15.629
seeing each other.

01:15.631 --> 01:17.465
Admitting to each other

01:17.467 --> 01:18.933
that we have a common goal here:

01:18.935 --> 01:20.167
to put an end to blood

01:20.169 --> 01:21.569
on these streets.

01:21.571 --> 01:23.204
Starting with some cooperation

01:23.206 --> 01:24.872
so we can be more precise

01:24.874 --> 01:26.574
in who we go after.

01:26.576 --> 01:27.908
That's profiling.
Man, you want us

01:27.910 --> 01:29.076
to snitch on our neighbors!

01:29.078 --> 01:30.978
Okay, okay, okay.
Any other questions?

01:30.980 --> 01:32.680
Okay, who else has
questions over here?

01:33.950 --> 01:36.417
Just a minute...
Just a minute!

01:43.359 --> 01:45.025
Are you going somewhere?

01:45.027 --> 01:46.694
Because we ain't.

01:46.696 --> 01:48.529
We can't.

01:48.531 --> 01:50.698
We ain't going nowhere.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.399
We're here.

01:54.871 --> 01:55.703
Please.

01:55.705 --> 01:57.238
The NYPD

01:57.240 --> 01:58.439
is on the scene

01:58.441 --> 02:00.708
and in the process
of securing the area.

02:03.479 --> 02:05.779
You're welcome.

02:10.386 --> 02:12.586
Next question.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.074

02:28.838 --> 02:30.738
<i>You want Chinese food</i>

02:30.740 --> 02:31.805
for lunch? We're...

02:31.807 --> 02:32.907
in a neighbor that has

02:32.909 --> 02:34.308
some of the best
Middle Eastern food

02:34.310 --> 02:35.376
in the city.

02:35.378 --> 02:37.144
What can I say, Eddie,
you want what you want

02:37.146 --> 02:39.613
when you want it.

02:42.151 --> 02:43.751
Hey!
Where'd you learn to drive,

02:43.753 --> 02:46.353
you moron?!

02:54.797 --> 02:55.963
Got a problem?

02:55.965 --> 02:58.666
Y-Yeah, you almost took the door
of my cab off.

02:58.668 --> 03:01.160
Sir, turn around, put
your hands against the vehicle.

03:01.161 --> 03:01.801
Come on, you kidding?

03:01.825 --> 03:03.405
I didn't do anything, man,
I didn't do anything.

03:03.406 --> 03:04.605
Come on.
You don't do what you're told,

03:04.607 --> 03:05.606
you'll see how much I'm kidding.

03:12.448 --> 03:14.281
I'm with Homeland Security.

03:14.283 --> 03:15.416
I'll throw in
resisting arrest.

03:15.418 --> 03:16.617
Leave him alone!

03:16.619 --> 03:18.218
What'd he do?

03:18.220 --> 03:19.520
Here we go again!

03:19.522 --> 03:20.788
What's going on here,
gentlemen?

03:20.790 --> 03:22.723
John McFarland, Department
of Homeland Security.

03:22.725 --> 03:24.825
Officer,
this individual

03:24.827 --> 03:26.160
tried to hit our vehicle.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.761
He's guilty
of reckless endangerment,

03:27.763 --> 03:29.296
resisting arrest...
Who's resisting?

03:29.298 --> 03:32.132
He needs to be handcuffed
and booked ASAP.

03:32.134 --> 03:33.667
Hold on, first off,

03:33.669 --> 03:35.536
didn't look like that
from where we were.

03:35.538 --> 03:37.738
Second, we don't take orders
from Homeland Security.

03:37.740 --> 03:39.273
Then you'll
take them from me.

03:39.275 --> 03:40.541
Lieutenant Apuzzo, NYPD.

03:40.543 --> 03:42.943
We're part of
a joint terrorism task force.

03:42.945 --> 03:44.178
Why don't you arrest him
yourself?

03:44.180 --> 03:45.346
We're due
at the courthouse, Officer.

03:45.348 --> 03:47.014
We don't have time.

03:47.016 --> 03:48.649
I'm assigning you this arrest.

03:48.651 --> 03:50.117
Make it happen.

04:00.429 --> 04:01.495
Damn it!

04:01.497 --> 04:03.697
I told you, it's broken.

04:03.699 --> 04:05.599
I can't stand living
in a rental house.

04:05.601 --> 04:07.768
You call that contractor, ask
him when he's going to be done

04:07.770 --> 04:08.969
with the kitchen at our house?

04:08.971 --> 04:11.038
If I ever hear back from him,
I will.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.707
So we're stuck with
our place half-gutted

04:13.709 --> 04:15.142
and no air conditioning

04:15.144 --> 04:16.709
on the hottest
night of the year?

04:16.712 --> 04:18.345
It's not the hottest night.

04:18.346 --> 04:21.214
Why do you got to make
everything into a catastrophe?

04:21.216 --> 04:23.717
Let's just open up some windows.

04:27.590 --> 04:28.956
How am I gonna sleep with that?

04:28.958 --> 04:29.958
I got ear plugs.

04:31.827 --> 04:34.495
All right, I'll go tell them
to knock it off, okay?

04:36.766 --> 04:39.333
This is Lieutenant Sid Gormley
from the P.C.'s office.

04:39.335 --> 04:41.301
Can you send
a radio car over here

04:41.303 --> 04:43.070
to the following address...

04:46.976 --> 04:49.677
- Hey, guys, what's up?
- Hey, guys.

04:49.679 --> 04:50.577
what's up?

04:52.848 --> 04:55.716
Kind of late to be partying
on a school night, isn't it?

04:55.718 --> 04:57.117
Go back in
house, <i>svin'ya.</i>

04:57.119 --> 04:58.485
I don't know
what you just said,

04:58.487 --> 05:00.754
but you're
on private property, okay?

05:00.756 --> 05:03.757
So, why don't you guys
just move along now?

05:03.759 --> 05:06.126
Call a cop, why don't you?

05:06.128 --> 05:08.696
I am a cop.

05:09.899 --> 05:12.166
You don't wanna be doing this,
seriously.

05:12.168 --> 05:13.701
All right,
who freaking threw that?

05:13.703 --> 05:15.335
Who threw that?
You know I didn't

05:15.337 --> 05:17.004
come out here
without calling backup first,

05:17.006 --> 05:17.771
don't you?
So, back up!

05:17.773 --> 05:18.739
Sid?

05:18.741 --> 05:19.773
Sheila, just stay

05:19.775 --> 05:21.108
in the house, no matter what.

05:26.015 --> 05:27.681
He's a cop, you idiots!

By the grace of God
and an eighth of an inch.

06:27.544 --> 06:28.943
That's good news.

06:28.945 --> 06:32.046
I'm trying to act that way.

06:33.583 --> 06:35.216
Nice of you to come up.

06:35.218 --> 06:37.118
He'll appreciate it.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.888
What do you got?

06:39.890 --> 06:43.725
Well, he doesn't remember much
of what happened,

06:43.727 --> 06:47.295
and, of course, the people in
the neighborhood aren't helping.

06:47.297 --> 06:48.863
Look, I don't want to overstep.

06:48.865 --> 06:50.164
Uh, I left the department.

06:50.166 --> 06:51.599
I know there's church and state

06:51.601 --> 06:53.401
with the DA's office.

06:53.403 --> 06:54.836
There's no way

06:54.838 --> 06:56.504
the people on that street
are going to cooperate.

06:56.506 --> 06:58.139
Even if you got your
best detectives on it.

06:58.141 --> 07:01.242
The house where
it happened

07:01.244 --> 07:03.678
is two blocks from
where I grew up.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.647
I still have family there.

07:05.649 --> 07:09.017
I appreciate your offer.
I really do.

07:09.019 --> 07:11.786
But I can't... I will not

07:11.788 --> 07:15.156
hand over a case where
one of our own was attacked.

07:15.158 --> 07:16.391
I'm not asking you to.

07:16.393 --> 07:18.693
Just let me do my thing,
on my own.

07:18.695 --> 07:21.162
I know my neighbors.
If-if they're gonna open up

07:21.164 --> 07:23.598
with anyone, it's gonna be
somebody who's been around

07:23.600 --> 07:25.733
all their lives.

07:25.735 --> 07:27.035
And not for nothing,

07:27.037 --> 07:28.803
I used to work with Sid too.

07:28.805 --> 07:32.573
We could fill this floor
with guys who worked with Sid.

07:32.575 --> 07:35.677
But I'm the one who's here.

07:38.715 --> 07:40.648
You're no longer NYPD.

07:40.650 --> 07:42.784
I can't tell you what to do.

07:42.786 --> 07:44.385
Thank you.

07:45.555 --> 07:47.355
Erin sign off on this?

07:47.357 --> 07:49.524
Not yet.

07:53.463 --> 07:57.065
Anthony, just don't
do anything I wouldn't do.

07:57.067 --> 07:59.500
Yes, sir.

08:08.044 --> 08:09.610
Name?

08:09.612 --> 08:10.778
Uh, Abdel.

08:10.780 --> 08:12.613
A-B-D-E-L.

08:12.615 --> 08:14.515
Last name Salem.

08:14.517 --> 08:17.418
S-A-L-E-M.

08:17.420 --> 08:19.253
Like the witch trials.

08:20.390 --> 08:22.223
Date of birth?

08:22.225 --> 08:24.258
July 4, 1981.

08:24.260 --> 08:26.728
For real.

08:26.730 --> 08:28.563
Birthplace?

08:28.565 --> 08:31.099
You really need that?

08:32.268 --> 08:34.268
Damascus.

08:34.270 --> 08:35.336
Syria?

08:35.337 --> 08:36.636
Yeah, I've been here
20 years.

08:36.639 --> 08:38.339
I'm a Mets fan, you know?

08:38.341 --> 08:40.908
If I have a son I'm gonna name
him Thor, after Syndergaard.

08:40.909 --> 08:42.677
You're a resident alien?

08:42.679 --> 08:44.645
Yeah, but I was just about
to get my citizenship.

08:44.647 --> 08:46.114
Point of entry
to the United States?

08:46.116 --> 08:47.315
JFK.
Look, you guys,

08:47.317 --> 08:49.250
you know I didn't
do anything wrong, okay?

08:49.252 --> 08:51.686
You can't send me back to Syria.

08:51.688 --> 08:52.754
Sir, we're just trying
to fill out a form here.

08:52.756 --> 08:53.721
I doubt they'll deport you.

08:53.723 --> 08:56.591
You're charging me
with felonies.

08:56.593 --> 08:58.192
I mean, who-who knows
what's gonna happen

08:58.194 --> 08:59.794
if Homeland Security's involved.

08:59.796 --> 09:01.963
They're gonna-they're gonna
find some-some little problem

09:01.965 --> 09:03.264
with my original
application.

09:03.266 --> 09:06.167
Jamie, is that true? Can they
send him back to Syria?

09:06.169 --> 09:07.869
Let's not get ahead of ourselves
here, okay?

09:07.871 --> 09:09.303
You'll be appointed an attorney
at your arraignment.

09:09.305 --> 09:10.905
If you want to fight the
charges, plead not guilty,

09:10.907 --> 09:12.974
that's up to you.
You're still in America.

09:12.976 --> 09:15.510
But if I lose,
my whole life could be over.

09:15.512 --> 09:17.912
Uh, all because of a-a stupid

09:17.914 --> 09:19.714
traffic argument.

09:19.716 --> 09:21.983
Guys... guys, listen, okay?

09:21.985 --> 09:24.385
Listen, I know that you can't

09:24.387 --> 09:26.087
speak out against other cops,

09:27.257 --> 09:29.891
But you were both there. Okay?

09:29.893 --> 09:31.793
You know what really happened.

09:31.795 --> 09:34.028
Jamie?

09:34.030 --> 09:36.097
I'm sorry, Abdel,
but we have a job to do, okay?

09:36.099 --> 09:37.765
Just tell the attorney
the whole truth,

09:37.767 --> 09:39.400
we'll get the witness
statements,

09:39.402 --> 09:40.868
and everything'll turn out okay.

09:48.211 --> 09:51.012
Geez, they got me so doped up

09:51.014 --> 09:53.514
I can't remember
anything about what happened.

09:53.516 --> 09:55.650
That's good--
because of the trauma, right?

09:55.652 --> 09:58.886
It also happens sometimes
with head injuries.

09:58.888 --> 10:00.955
It's called retrograde amnesia.

10:00.957 --> 10:02.623
What's the last thing
you remember, Sid?

10:02.625 --> 10:03.825
Me and Sheila

10:03.827 --> 10:07.028
were having lobsters
at Gargiulo's

10:07.030 --> 10:09.230
and, um, we were wondering

10:09.232 --> 10:12.066
what happened to the big octopus

10:12.068 --> 10:13.801
on the ceiling.

10:13.803 --> 10:15.436
And that... that's all I got.

10:15.438 --> 10:17.605
Don't strain yourself, honey.

10:17.607 --> 10:19.974
We've been through a lot.

10:19.976 --> 10:22.410
Could you identify the
people who did this to you

10:22.412 --> 10:24.745
or what led up to
the confrontation?

10:24.747 --> 10:26.247
I got nothing.

10:26.249 --> 10:29.350
I mean, it's like
a giant pothole in my memory.

10:29.352 --> 10:31.185
Sheila, what'd you see?

10:31.187 --> 10:33.521
It was so dark.
There were so many of 'em.

10:33.523 --> 10:35.957
Aren't we getting anything
off the canvas?

10:35.959 --> 10:37.859
You know the kind of
neighborhood it is, Sid.

10:37.861 --> 10:39.727
But I have to ask.

10:39.729 --> 10:41.796
There are people saying
that you might have

10:41.798 --> 10:43.297
provoked this
by taking your gun out.

10:43.299 --> 10:46.934
Oh, no, no, I had it on me
when they brought me in.

10:46.936 --> 10:49.203
Somebody must have
sucker punched me

10:49.205 --> 10:51.072
before I could get it out.
Aah!

10:51.074 --> 10:53.141
Okay, easy,
Lieutenant.

10:53.143 --> 10:54.675
Nice and easy.

10:54.677 --> 10:55.943
Sorry, Anthony.

10:55.945 --> 10:58.579
I'm not doing myself
much good here, am I?

10:58.581 --> 11:00.481
Your job right now
is to get better.

11:00.483 --> 11:03.084
I'll take care of the rest.
Thank you.

11:08.258 --> 11:10.324
Guy gets shot
two blocks from where

11:10.326 --> 11:11.959
the police commissioner's
speaking and everything's

11:11.961 --> 11:13.995
business as usual.
Not even a look.

11:13.997 --> 11:16.030
No. What's it gonna take?

11:16.032 --> 11:17.932
Wasting your time.

11:17.934 --> 11:19.167
What's that?

11:19.169 --> 11:21.969
Just saying, you can
stand out here all day,

11:21.971 --> 11:23.938
won't do you no good.
No one's

11:23.940 --> 11:26.207
gonna talk to you.
Why's that?

11:26.209 --> 11:29.410
See all these people out here
with canes and wheelchairs?

11:29.412 --> 11:31.712
Those aren't from car accidents.

11:31.714 --> 11:33.381
In fact, I'm done talking.

11:33.383 --> 11:34.649
Hey, I know you,
don't I?

11:34.651 --> 11:36.350
I saw you around here.

11:36.352 --> 11:37.818
There was a shooting
over the summer.

11:37.820 --> 11:41.255
I tried to talk to you. It was
your cousin got shot, right?

11:41.257 --> 11:42.924
How's he doing?

11:42.926 --> 11:46.127
Still a fool.
But with a limp now.

11:46.129 --> 11:47.728
Could be
worse, right?

11:47.730 --> 11:50.531
Look, we don't want to
jam you up out here,

11:50.533 --> 11:52.533
but were you at
the basketball game

11:52.535 --> 11:54.569
when the shooting occurred?
Two guys got hit.

11:54.571 --> 11:56.871
No, I-I was inside.

11:56.873 --> 11:58.773
But...

11:58.775 --> 12:00.575
it's been crazy, you know?

12:00.577 --> 12:01.842
Most people around here

12:01.844 --> 12:03.911
just want to live their
lives and chill, but

12:03.913 --> 12:05.947
ever since Los Lordes
got locked up,

12:05.949 --> 12:09.283
it's been an all-out war between
the gangs trying to take over.

12:09.285 --> 12:10.431
Maybe we give you a card,
you give us a call later?

12:10.455 --> 12:11.153
I don't know..

12:11.154 --> 12:13.321
Don't be snitching
to the Po-Po, sister!

12:13.323 --> 12:14.822
They ain't gonna be
around when you need them.

12:14.824 --> 12:16.624
Hey, tough guy,
you want to come down

12:16.626 --> 12:18.392
and say it
to our faces?

12:18.394 --> 12:19.927
Yo, go back to the Bronx Zoo,

12:19.929 --> 12:21.362
Furious George.

12:21.364 --> 12:23.764
Who is that?

12:23.766 --> 12:25.633
Fausto.

12:25.635 --> 12:27.335
He's with
the Los Pozoleros crew.

12:27.337 --> 12:28.003
Really?

12:28.027 --> 12:29.638
One of the gangs
shooting it out yesterday?

12:29.639 --> 12:32.406
I know he was at the game
when it went off.

12:33.576 --> 12:35.176
Good, let's go talk to him.

12:43.086 --> 12:45.720
Strike marks.

12:45.722 --> 12:47.221
Must be some neighbor.

12:49.993 --> 12:51.259
Police, open up.

12:51.261 --> 12:52.760
Read the mat, sucker.

12:53.796 --> 12:55.763
That's real funny.

12:55.765 --> 12:58.065
How about we lock you up
for obstructing, huh?

12:58.067 --> 13:00.968
For what, a class A
misdemeanor? I'm scared,

13:00.970 --> 13:02.737
Mr. Policeman. Now slip
your summons under the door

13:02.739 --> 13:04.071
and get the hell away.

13:04.073 --> 13:06.374
Tell you what, tough guy,
how about you open the door

13:06.376 --> 13:08.109
and come on out here,
we'll settle this like men,

13:08.111 --> 13:10.478
all right? Come on,
forget I'm a cop. Show me

13:10.480 --> 13:13.080
what you got.

13:14.684 --> 13:16.250
You want to see what I got, huh?

13:16.252 --> 13:17.985
Well, here
it is.

13:17.987 --> 13:20.821
You still want
to kick my ass now?

13:43.493 --> 13:44.692
Aunt Sophia.

13:44.694 --> 13:46.193
I got nothing to say to you.

13:46.195 --> 13:48.129
Come on, you know
you're gonna let me in.

13:48.131 --> 13:49.363
Leave me standing
on the doorstep,

13:49.365 --> 13:50.698
the neighbors are gonna talk.

13:56.873 --> 13:58.339
Last time you were here

13:58.341 --> 14:00.775
you used me to
lock up my son.

14:00.777 --> 14:04.078
Joey was up to no good
and we both know it.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.347
I thought you were just
gonna talk to him.

14:06.349 --> 14:07.682
Sophia,

14:07.684 --> 14:09.850
you're still my aunt,
Joey's still my cousin.

14:09.852 --> 14:12.053
How long are we gonna
keep this up?

14:12.055 --> 14:13.621
What do you want?

14:13.623 --> 14:15.356
You heard about
the police lieutenant

14:15.358 --> 14:17.458
getting jumped outside of
the house he was renting, right?

14:17.460 --> 14:18.759
Of course.

14:18.761 --> 14:20.328
It happened just down the block.

14:20.330 --> 14:21.529
The police are having trouble

14:21.531 --> 14:23.130
getting witnesses
to step forward.

14:23.132 --> 14:24.699
Naturally. Anthony,
the neighborhood

14:24.701 --> 14:27.201
has changed since you left.
The Russians?

14:27.203 --> 14:28.769
Some of the young people--
they don't care

14:28.771 --> 14:30.338
nothing about nobody.
They're thugs.

14:30.340 --> 14:31.906
Yeah, well, our crowd
didn't always

14:31.908 --> 14:33.240
roll out the welcome wagon.

14:33.242 --> 14:34.575
Oh, no, it's different.

14:34.577 --> 14:36.477
People are scared.
They're not gonna

14:36.479 --> 14:37.912
talk to cops.
Maybe they just need

14:37.914 --> 14:40.014
someone they know
to encourage them.

14:41.117 --> 14:42.750
You want me

14:42.752 --> 14:44.652
to get my neighbors
to cooperate?

14:44.654 --> 14:47.154
No, thank you.

14:55.098 --> 14:57.064
Sorry I'm late.

14:57.066 --> 14:58.566
Hardly.

14:58.568 --> 15:00.601
You want a drink
before we sit down?

15:00.603 --> 15:01.669
What are you having?

15:01.671 --> 15:04.038
Bloody Mary
without the vodka.

15:04.040 --> 15:06.474
Isn't it just easier
to say Virgin Mary?

15:06.476 --> 15:10.177
Not if you had Jesuit teachers
in high school.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.681
What?

15:13.683 --> 15:15.349
Well, I've always kind of felt

15:15.351 --> 15:18.085
that ordering a drink
named after Jesus' mom

15:18.087 --> 15:20.755
in a bar was a sin.

15:20.757 --> 15:23.024
Seriously?

15:23.026 --> 15:25.292
Makes sense
if you think about it.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.296
Jamie talk to you?

15:29.298 --> 15:30.498
No.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.699
Oh.

15:31.701 --> 15:33.734
What?

15:33.736 --> 15:36.203
No, he said he was going to.

15:36.205 --> 15:37.805
About?

15:37.807 --> 15:40.541
Well, he came to me first,
nothing I could do for him.

15:40.543 --> 15:43.044
About?

15:44.013 --> 15:46.547
I think Jamie
should speak to you.

15:49.018 --> 15:51.652
Okay.

15:53.856 --> 15:55.256
Oh, by the way,

15:55.258 --> 15:57.291
I appreciate
Anthony stepping up,

15:57.293 --> 15:58.759
and thank you to you too.

15:58.761 --> 16:00.227
Stepping up for what?

16:00.229 --> 16:01.695
You know.

16:01.697 --> 16:03.564
No, I don't know.

16:03.566 --> 16:06.467
Oh.

16:06.469 --> 16:08.269
Oh, what?

16:08.271 --> 16:11.038
Well, he's kind of
helping me out

16:11.040 --> 16:14.041
with the Gormley assault.

16:14.043 --> 16:16.911
Oh, that's nice.

16:16.913 --> 16:18.579
I thought so.

16:18.581 --> 16:20.448
No, I meant <i>nice.</i>

16:20.450 --> 16:22.416
As in, my go-to detective

16:22.418 --> 16:24.085
is working on a case for you

16:24.087 --> 16:26.754
and neither of you
thought to tell me.

16:26.756 --> 16:28.956
I just did.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.526
Check?

16:37.967 --> 16:39.967
You for real, yo?

16:39.969 --> 16:41.635
You brought me
all the way down here

16:41.637 --> 16:43.070
in a handicap van

16:43.072 --> 16:44.638
for some
<i>puto</i> obstruction charge?

16:44.640 --> 16:46.974
Intimidating a witness
is serious business.

16:46.976 --> 16:48.342
Freedom of speech,
my man.

16:48.344 --> 16:52.012
Expressing my opinion.

16:52.014 --> 16:53.714
Check out
the Bill of Rights sometime.

16:53.716 --> 16:55.583
Well, how about you
just talk to me instead?

16:55.585 --> 16:57.384
About what?

16:57.386 --> 16:58.853
About what happened
at the basketball court.

16:58.855 --> 17:00.087
Pretty sure you know

17:00.089 --> 17:01.355
all the players.

17:01.357 --> 17:02.556
Me?

17:02.558 --> 17:03.824
Yeah, you.

17:03.826 --> 17:04.959
I'm just

17:04.961 --> 17:06.727
living in my little apartment,

17:06.729 --> 17:09.063
getting by on my
little disability.

17:16.239 --> 17:17.471
All right.

17:17.473 --> 17:21.075
Wow, looks like you got
quite a record here, Fausto.

17:22.178 --> 17:23.577
Two dozen arrests,

17:23.579 --> 17:27.481
four felony convictions,
two long bids upstate-- wow.

17:27.483 --> 17:28.716
Okay.

17:28.718 --> 17:30.584
So now you know who I am.

17:30.586 --> 17:34.088
It also says you were number two
in a gang called Los Pozoleros.

17:34.090 --> 17:37.791
Under one
Eduardo "Pozolero" Soto.

17:37.793 --> 17:41.562
Who was charged and acquitted
for shooting you in the back

17:41.564 --> 17:44.899
when you tried to make a move
and start your own operation.

17:44.901 --> 17:46.800
It be's that way sometime.

17:46.802 --> 17:48.802
Hate the game, not the player.

17:48.804 --> 17:52.006
So you're okay, being paralyzed
from the waist down

17:52.008 --> 17:54.375
while he takes over the
drug market at the Bitter End?

17:54.377 --> 17:57.278
My mother
used to tell me, "Fausto,

17:57.280 --> 18:00.648
life's good,
but it ain't always fair."

18:00.650 --> 18:03.450
Well, it certainly
hasn't been fair to you, huh?

18:03.452 --> 18:05.819
This guy crippled
you, Fausto.

18:05.821 --> 18:07.688
You never thought
about getting a little payback?

18:07.690 --> 18:10.057
I ain't never snitched
to cops before.

18:10.059 --> 18:11.892
And I ain't gonna start now.
You do this

18:11.894 --> 18:14.762
the hard way, you can end up
in a state prison

18:14.764 --> 18:17.064
where they don't exactly have
the best medical facilities,

18:17.066 --> 18:19.300
you'll be far away
from your family and friends.

18:19.302 --> 18:22.636
Most of them stopped coming by
when I stopped making money.

18:22.638 --> 18:25.539
So there ain't no type of hell
you could show me

18:25.541 --> 18:27.474
that I don't already know.

18:27.476 --> 18:30.578
Okay, well, it's only a matter
of time before somebody talks,

18:30.580 --> 18:32.313
and when they do...

18:32.315 --> 18:34.281
we could just lock you up
with the rest of them.

18:34.283 --> 18:37.284
Who knows, maybe you'll even get
to share a cell with Eduardo, huh?

18:37.286 --> 18:38.719
I don't think so,
<i>hombre.</i>

18:38.721 --> 18:42.389
<i>Pozolero</i> means "the stewmaker."

18:42.391 --> 18:47.394
Because anybody that crossed him
ended up in an acid bath.

18:47.396 --> 18:50.297
So why don't you take me
the hell home.

18:56.606 --> 18:58.939
All right.

18:59.775 --> 19:01.775
How we doing?

19:01.777 --> 19:04.245
Well, they say only
the good die young,

19:04.247 --> 19:06.280
so I'll be fine.

19:06.282 --> 19:07.815
Don't listen.
He's doing much better.

19:07.817 --> 19:10.284
The doctors just want to keep
him around a little longer

19:10.286 --> 19:11.385
for observation.

19:11.387 --> 19:12.620
You getting anywhere?

19:12.622 --> 19:15.022
Sure would help if you
could remember a little more.

19:16.192 --> 19:19.293
We got these photos
off a security camera

19:19.295 --> 19:22.062
around the corner
a few minutes after the attack.

19:22.064 --> 19:25.165
Recognize anyone?
Nah.

19:25.167 --> 19:27.534
I'm sorry, Anthony,
I got nothing.

19:27.536 --> 19:29.036
So no idea who these kids are,

19:29.038 --> 19:31.372
or who would want to set you up
for a beatdown?

19:31.374 --> 19:33.540
I thought I got along
with everybody.

19:33.542 --> 19:35.676
Look, Sid... Lieutenant,

19:35.678 --> 19:37.478
I know the PC's
got hawk-eyes

19:37.480 --> 19:38.712
on this 'cause it's you,

19:38.714 --> 19:41.749
and I don't want to let him down
or get on his bad side.

19:41.751 --> 19:42.783
So please,

19:42.785 --> 19:44.818
help me help you.

19:44.820 --> 19:47.721
All right. Let me
take another look.

20:01.837 --> 20:04.338
Nobody comes out
here for a beer.

20:04.340 --> 20:06.607
Sunday dinner,
sure, but, uh,

20:06.609 --> 20:09.109
not Thursday night
beers. So shoot.

20:10.479 --> 20:13.180
All right, I got caught up
in this livery driver arrest

20:13.182 --> 20:15.683
with some Joint Terrorist
Task Force guys.

20:15.685 --> 20:17.685
Well, that's your business.

20:17.687 --> 20:19.019
I think it might be yours, too.

20:19.021 --> 20:20.688
From where
we were standing,

20:20.690 --> 20:22.690
it looked like
the Homeland Security guy

20:22.692 --> 20:23.757
provoked the incident.

20:23.759 --> 20:25.959
And then the others
had to back him up.

20:25.961 --> 20:28.495
That's a lot to see
from standing nearby.

20:28.497 --> 20:29.930
I admit it wasn't
a perfect angle,

20:29.932 --> 20:31.965
but it looked like the cabdriver
didn't do anything wrong.

20:31.967 --> 20:33.967
Looked like, or is a fact?

20:33.969 --> 20:36.704
Let's just say I wasn't comfortable
with the way it all went down.

20:36.706 --> 20:40.574
Well, I'm not sure where
comfort enters into this.

20:42.778 --> 20:45.079
Look, do you know where
those guys were headed?

20:45.081 --> 20:46.355
They said they
were going to court.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.582
Yeah?

20:47.583 --> 20:50.784
But what you don't know is
the guy who started the beef

20:50.786 --> 20:54.121
is the linchpin in the biggest
counterterrorism case

20:54.123 --> 20:56.223
the Feds have had in years.

20:56.225 --> 20:58.225
Which has absolutely nothing
to do with this cabdriver.

20:58.227 --> 21:00.561
I mean, he's just a schmuck
trying to make a living.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.096
He already spent the night
at Rikers.

21:02.098 --> 21:05.866
And he will get a lawyer and
have his day in court. But...

21:05.868 --> 21:07.701
Jamie...

21:07.703 --> 21:10.304
this can't be your problem.

21:10.306 --> 21:12.005
Or mine.

21:12.007 --> 21:14.575
My name
on the arrest report, Dad.

21:14.577 --> 21:17.611
Well, you need to start
picking your battles.

21:17.613 --> 21:20.013
Which is what I'm doing here.

21:20.015 --> 21:23.117
So you want me to what?

21:23.119 --> 21:25.519
Upend a federal case
because you think...

21:25.521 --> 21:27.521
<i>maybe</i> that the key witness

21:27.523 --> 21:29.923
might have had a hand
in a traffic beef?

21:29.925 --> 21:33.360
So you really don't want
to hear my side of it?

21:33.362 --> 21:35.996
You were assigned the arrest,
you processed the arrest--

21:35.998 --> 21:37.531
you did your duty.

21:37.533 --> 21:39.199
Am I missing something here?

21:39.201 --> 21:42.002
That an innocent bystander
got caught up in the grinder

21:42.004 --> 21:44.972
of the system that both you
and I have responsibility for.

21:44.974 --> 21:49.309
That's a whole lot
to put on one collar.

21:49.311 --> 21:50.778
I don't understand
why you're breaking your neck

21:50.780 --> 21:52.579
trying to look
the other way on this.

21:53.449 --> 21:55.616
Look, maybe you're
having a bad day.

21:56.485 --> 21:59.920
I don't know.
Thanks for your time.

22:19.812 --> 22:22.145
Officers Reagan and Janko.
You asked to see us?

22:22.147 --> 22:23.680
I'm Abdul Salem's lawyer.

22:23.682 --> 22:26.794
I understand you were
the arresting officers the other day.

22:26.795 --> 22:28.286
I'm sure you already have
the arrest report.

22:28.287 --> 22:29.419
I do.

22:29.421 --> 22:30.887
And I noticed

22:30.889 --> 22:32.456
some rather obvious
irregularities.

22:32.458 --> 22:35.225
If you have any questions
for us, you'll have to ask us

22:35.227 --> 22:36.360
on the stand.

22:36.362 --> 22:37.461
We'll be under oath.

22:37.463 --> 22:39.796
Abdul is in a medical
observation unit

22:39.798 --> 22:41.231
on Rikers right now.

22:41.233 --> 22:42.633
He got badly beaten

22:42.635 --> 22:44.668
by a bunch of other
prisoners for being Arab

22:44.670 --> 22:46.269
in the wrong place.

22:46.271 --> 22:49.306
I'm sorry, but there's
nothing we can do about that.

22:50.242 --> 22:53.210
He said you both saw
what really happened,

22:53.212 --> 22:55.812
and that you both seemed
like good people.

22:55.814 --> 22:57.648
We seem that way because we are.

22:57.650 --> 23:00.384
All I'm asking is for you to do
what's right under the law.

23:00.386 --> 23:02.386
All due respect, you don't know
what you're asking.

23:02.388 --> 23:05.255
You know and I know
these officers lied.

23:05.257 --> 23:07.557
And it's going to cost my client
his citizenship,

23:07.559 --> 23:09.993
if not his life.
We don't know

23:09.995 --> 23:11.294
any of those things, ma'am.

23:11.296 --> 23:12.963
I'm sorry
for Mr. Salem's troubles,

23:12.965 --> 23:14.364
but it's out of our hands.

23:14.366 --> 23:16.099
If you'll excuse us.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.780
Went by to see Sid
this morning.

23:29.782 --> 23:31.214
Glad to see he's
doing better.

23:31.216 --> 23:33.970
For once, that hard Irish head
of his came in handy.

23:33.994 --> 23:35.687
Right.

23:35.688 --> 23:38.351
Hey, you know I wanted
the corner piece.

23:38.352 --> 23:39.167
What do you think
you're doing?

23:39.190 --> 23:41.190
Buttmunch.

23:41.326 --> 23:42.726
Excuse me,
uh, language.

23:42.728 --> 23:45.295
- Is that a word?
- Apparently so.

23:45.297 --> 23:47.130
What's with you two?
You've been beefin' all day.

23:47.132 --> 23:48.799
Sean doesn't know how
to mind his business.

23:48.801 --> 23:49.833
How so?

23:50.602 --> 23:52.803
There was this fight
at school.

23:52.805 --> 23:53.837
And?

23:53.839 --> 23:56.039
Well, these girls
jumped a new girl

23:56.041 --> 23:58.408
in the stairwell,
and they were beating her up.

23:58.410 --> 23:59.743
And you were there
when it happened?

23:59.745 --> 24:01.611
The assistant principal
asked for witnesses

24:01.613 --> 24:04.047
to come forward and
say who started it.

24:04.049 --> 24:06.083
And, Jack,
you didn't say anything?

24:06.085 --> 24:07.350
I wasn't
the only one there.

24:07.352 --> 24:08.985
Well, did they?
I don't know.

24:08.987 --> 24:10.854
Well, I guess that means
you're still on the hook.

24:10.856 --> 24:12.422
Yeah, it's like
the bystander effect.

24:12.424 --> 24:13.824
What is this?

24:13.826 --> 24:15.459
It's when people
won't help a victim

24:15.461 --> 24:17.527
because they think
others around can do it.

24:17.529 --> 24:18.829
Just call it apathy.

24:18.831 --> 24:20.163
Or cowardice.

24:20.165 --> 24:22.365
Some of those girls are pretty
fierce when they get together.

24:22.367 --> 24:24.601
And most of them
have boyfriends.

24:24.603 --> 24:26.636
That's no excuse
for not getting involved.

24:26.638 --> 24:29.239
Come on, Jack,
you know that.

24:29.241 --> 24:31.608
Everybody at this table
knows that.

24:31.610 --> 24:33.810
All right, so what am I
supposed to do, then?

24:33.812 --> 24:35.045
Should I be a rat?

24:35.047 --> 24:37.214
This girl someone you knew?

24:38.684 --> 24:39.816
No.

24:39.818 --> 24:41.351
Then it's
not the same thing.

24:41.353 --> 24:43.019
If you see someone else
being treated unfairly,

24:43.021 --> 24:44.554
it's your duty to speak up.

24:44.556 --> 24:47.324
At least that's what
I was taught at this table.

24:47.326 --> 24:50.727
Along with the value
of weighing the circumstances.

24:50.729 --> 24:52.996
- What's going on here?
- A lieutenant had me make a bad arrest,

24:52.998 --> 24:54.631
and now I'm supposed
to just let it go.

24:54.633 --> 24:56.333
That's not what
<i>I</i> was talking about.

24:56.335 --> 24:57.701
It's clear to me.
You didn't raise

24:57.703 --> 24:59.035
any of us to be bystanders.

24:59.037 --> 25:00.637
No, I didn't.
But I didn't raise you

25:00.639 --> 25:02.706
to tilt at every windmill
you come across, either.

25:02.708 --> 25:04.293
Just 'cause you thought
the guy was wrong...

25:04.294 --> 25:04.906
Not think.

25:04.910 --> 25:06.977
<i>Was</i> wrong, Dad.
From what I've heard, says you

25:06.979 --> 25:08.278
and you alone.
And Eddie.

25:08.280 --> 25:09.646
And now the guy's
in the hospital

25:09.648 --> 25:11.748
for looking Middle-Eastern
at Rikers.

25:15.220 --> 25:17.687
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.667
Pass the salad.

25:53.625 --> 25:56.293
What do you want this time?

25:56.295 --> 25:58.695
Yeah, well, I didn't come back
with a warrant if that's

25:58.697 --> 26:00.163
what you're thinking.

26:00.165 --> 26:01.898
Look, you said
your family abandoned you.

26:01.900 --> 26:03.400
I figured
it's probably been a while

26:03.402 --> 26:04.901
since you had
a home-cooked meal, so...

26:04.903 --> 26:06.703
Oh, so you came
out of the goodness

26:06.705 --> 26:08.405
of your heart to look in on me?

26:08.407 --> 26:10.006
Well, a guy's got to eat,
doesn't he?

26:10.008 --> 26:12.175
What, you want
to be my guardian angel now?

26:12.177 --> 26:14.311
Well, just take the food,
all right?

26:14.313 --> 26:16.146
You watching a game?

26:16.148 --> 26:18.348
Soccer-- Wales versus Slovakia.

26:18.350 --> 26:19.683
You wouldn't be interested.

26:19.685 --> 26:23.587
Actually,
my son plays soccer. Fun.

26:23.589 --> 26:25.422
Fun.

26:25.424 --> 26:29.226
Look, why don't we sit down,
eat a little food,

26:29.228 --> 26:30.827
watch a little soccer?

26:30.829 --> 26:32.596
We don't have to talk
about anything.

26:32.598 --> 26:34.764
What do you say?

26:49.648 --> 26:51.915
What's good, Five-O?

26:57.990 --> 27:00.857
What are you doing here?

27:00.859 --> 27:02.525
I'm investigating an assault

27:02.527 --> 27:04.527
on a New York City
police lieutenant

27:04.529 --> 27:06.496
that happened a couple
of blocks from here.

27:06.498 --> 27:09.666
We don't know anything
about a cop getting beat up.

27:10.636 --> 27:12.602
Anybody else talking to you
about it?

27:12.604 --> 27:14.304
Why don't you let us
worry about that?

27:14.306 --> 27:17.207
We own these streets.

27:17.209 --> 27:19.009
Yeah, I'm from
here, my friend.

27:19.011 --> 27:20.510
These are my neighbors.

27:20.512 --> 27:23.013
They are old,
and their houses are ugly.

27:24.316 --> 27:26.783
If they are smart,
they will sell cheap

27:26.785 --> 27:29.419
and get out
while they still they can.

27:31.223 --> 27:33.256
Thanks for the tip.

27:33.258 --> 27:37.160
Maybe I'll come back
with an offer for you.

27:38.730 --> 27:41.765
Mm. See this is what
I don't like about soccer.

27:41.767 --> 27:44.968
We've been sitting here an hour,
the score is nothing-nothing.

27:44.970 --> 27:47.237
It's because you're so used
to watching them easy games

27:47.239 --> 27:48.872
like-like football
and basketball, you know?

27:48.874 --> 27:51.574
Football is easy?
Basketball is easy?!

27:51.576 --> 27:55.011
I'm saying, though, if there's
200 points within a game,

27:55.013 --> 27:56.613
one doesn't really
matter that much.

27:56.615 --> 27:59.349
Here, it's all about
the anticipation.

27:59.351 --> 28:01.818
- Every touch of the ball counts.
- Hmm.

28:01.820 --> 28:04.721
And when they finally score,
yo, it's better than sex.

28:04.723 --> 28:06.856
I don't know
if I'd go that far.

28:08.060 --> 28:11.361
Ah! Did you see that?

28:11.363 --> 28:13.129
You seen that?!
That was nice!

28:13.131 --> 28:17.133
That was nice. Not nicer
than sex, but it was nice.

28:20.105 --> 28:23.707
So now you feel like you're
doing your job now, huh?

28:23.709 --> 28:26.242
You're bonding with me
instead of beating up on me?

28:26.244 --> 28:27.410
You and I both know

28:27.412 --> 28:29.546
you would have never
let me through that door

28:29.548 --> 28:32.449
if you weren't thinking about
turning on Eduardo yourself.

28:32.451 --> 28:35.385
Thinking ain't the
same thing as doing.

28:35.387 --> 28:38.688
Guy put a bullet in your back,
took away everything you had.

28:38.690 --> 28:41.691
I don't know about you,
but if that was me,

28:41.693 --> 28:43.059
I couldn't live with it.

28:43.061 --> 28:45.328
Yeah, but you ain't me.

28:45.330 --> 28:47.230
True, I'm not you.

28:47.232 --> 28:50.133
But you can take
his whole crew off the street.

28:50.135 --> 28:52.669
You could make him pay
for what he did to you,

28:52.671 --> 28:54.730
keep him from ever doing it
to anybody else again.

28:54.731 --> 28:57.074
Yo. Stop trying to put that
snitch jacket on me, Reagan.

28:57.075 --> 28:58.208
I don't get down like that.

28:58.210 --> 29:01.311
Everybody wants
to be a hero sometime,

29:01.313 --> 29:03.079
Fausto.

29:03.081 --> 29:06.149
I think you got it in you.

29:14.092 --> 29:15.625
It's okay.

29:15.627 --> 29:17.761
Oh, look who is here.

29:17.763 --> 29:21.431
Five-O has come to see what
the young people are up to.

29:21.433 --> 29:23.633
Have you come

29:23.635 --> 29:24.801
to smoke with us?

29:24.803 --> 29:26.136
I quit years ago.

29:26.138 --> 29:28.638
But I brought you something else
you could use.

29:29.808 --> 29:31.241
This is a diaper.

29:31.243 --> 29:33.410
I figured Vlad must need it.

29:35.814 --> 29:40.216
A summons for public urination.

29:40.218 --> 29:42.519
You never paid it.
On your feet.

29:42.521 --> 29:43.285
We don't have to take this.

29:43.309 --> 29:45.156
It's okay.
It's okay.

29:45.157 --> 29:47.190
If he wants to take it
to the next level...

29:47.192 --> 29:49.059
You're smarter than you look.

29:49.061 --> 29:50.627
Now come on.

29:50.629 --> 29:53.129
I cannot believe you
got Fausto to agree

29:53.131 --> 29:55.398
to come in and talk
to the grand jury.

29:55.400 --> 29:57.567
A good detective can be
anything he needs to be.

29:57.569 --> 29:59.536
You just got to know
how to talk to people, Baez.

29:59.538 --> 30:02.806
Fausto?

30:02.808 --> 30:06.109
What are those, footsteps?

30:06.111 --> 30:07.811
It can't be Fausto
walking around.

30:07.813 --> 30:09.345
Fausto?!

30:10.215 --> 30:13.283
Good afternoon, detectives.

30:13.285 --> 30:14.884
I'm Eduardo Soto.

30:14.886 --> 30:16.986
I understand
you've been asking about me.

30:16.988 --> 30:18.788
Where the hell's Fausto?

30:19.658 --> 30:21.658
Hey, Reagan.

30:21.660 --> 30:24.294
Tell your wife thank you
again for the lasagna.

30:24.296 --> 30:29.032
And, uh, changed my mind
about going to court.

30:29.868 --> 30:31.334
What the hell is this?

30:31.336 --> 30:33.103
I heard you stopped by.

30:33.105 --> 30:35.805
We had a conversation
about long-term healthcare.

30:35.807 --> 30:37.607
You threatened a man
in a wheelchair?

30:37.609 --> 30:40.176
I reminded him
where his interests are.

30:40.178 --> 30:42.378
And you went for it?

30:42.380 --> 30:44.414
Why not?
You gonna keep coming by

30:44.416 --> 30:46.349
with dinner
after this is all over?

30:46.351 --> 30:47.984
You gonna have my back

30:47.986 --> 30:50.320
when the bullets
start flying again, yo?

30:50.322 --> 30:51.421
We could protect you.

30:51.423 --> 30:54.657
Good luck, <i>chica.</i>

30:54.659 --> 30:57.227
Fausto knows
anybody can be got anytime.

30:57.229 --> 30:59.929
Oh, no, he didn't. You didn't
seriously just menace a witness

30:59.931 --> 31:01.764
in front of two NYPD detectives.

31:01.766 --> 31:03.366
Just stating facts.

31:03.368 --> 31:04.834
Look,

31:04.836 --> 31:07.604
I'm not doing this
because I'm scared, okay?

31:07.606 --> 31:09.239
All right.
It's my choice.

31:09.241 --> 31:11.341
I'm doing this
because I want to.

31:11.343 --> 31:13.676
Yeah, you want to willingly
team up with the son of a bitch

31:13.678 --> 31:15.879
that shot you
and made you a cripple for life?

31:15.881 --> 31:17.180
I ain't a cripple, yo.

31:17.182 --> 31:18.548
I'm still a man.

31:18.550 --> 31:22.385
Then act like a man and
stand up to this punk.

31:22.387 --> 31:25.321
But, see, he can't stand up.
That's the point.

31:25.323 --> 31:28.958
And if he can't stand up,
no one else will.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.560
You can't intimidate everyone.

31:30.562 --> 31:31.828
Really?

31:31.830 --> 31:33.796
How many other witnesses
do you have?

31:33.798 --> 31:35.865
Fausto, look at me.

31:35.867 --> 31:39.302
Hey. He's using you.

31:39.304 --> 31:40.904
He's using you,
and when he's done with you,

31:40.906 --> 31:42.539
he's gonna take you
off the count.

31:42.541 --> 31:46.309
Once a gangster,
always a gangster.

31:46.311 --> 31:48.478
Maybe so.

31:49.348 --> 31:51.247
But that's the game.

31:51.249 --> 31:53.382
And I'm gonna play it
to the end.

31:53.384 --> 31:56.285
Oh, I really thought
you were a lot more than that.

31:56.287 --> 31:58.154
You thought wrong.

32:12.344 --> 32:15.954
Look, I appreciate Theater
of the Absurd performances,

32:15.959 --> 32:19.492
but public urination hasn't been
a crime since before the summer.

32:19.494 --> 32:21.227
Doesn't let your client
off the hook

32:21.229 --> 32:23.964
for not paying an outstanding
fine, Mr. Dukaski.

32:23.966 --> 32:26.099
So give me my wallet,
and I'll pay the fine,

32:26.101 --> 32:27.467
and then I'm out of here.

32:27.469 --> 32:29.402
Well, we have other matters
to discuss.

32:29.404 --> 32:32.272
Like the assault of a
New York City police lieutenant.

32:32.274 --> 32:33.640
We've already been through this.

32:33.642 --> 32:35.408
My client denies all knowledge

32:35.410 --> 32:37.277
of the incident.
So stupid.

32:37.279 --> 32:38.945
Actually, things <i>have</i> changed.

32:38.947 --> 32:40.313
We've been collecting complaints

32:40.315 --> 32:42.815
about your crew shaking down
local store owners

32:42.817 --> 32:45.351
and trying to force homeowners
into selling

32:45.353 --> 32:46.786
their houses cheap.

32:46.788 --> 32:50.423
I'd say, you're looking
at five years minimum so far.

32:50.425 --> 32:53.192
I pulled your rap sheet.

32:53.194 --> 32:54.627
You've been arrested
three times before.

32:54.629 --> 32:55.628
But never convicted.

32:55.630 --> 32:58.197
Because no one ever crosses me.

32:58.199 --> 33:00.566
In all three cases,
you were arrested and released.

33:00.568 --> 33:03.736
In all three cases, the same
confidential informant talked.

33:03.738 --> 33:07.439
That tells me the real reason
you've never been convicted--

33:07.441 --> 33:10.809
you always snitch
on your friends.

33:10.811 --> 33:12.744
Those records
are supposed to be sealed.

33:12.746 --> 33:15.247
Think anybody's gonna care once
the word's out on the street?

33:15.249 --> 33:17.449
You give us everyone
and everything,

33:17.451 --> 33:21.286
including your role in the
assault of Lieutenant Gormley.

33:21.288 --> 33:23.455
This is
a one-time offer.

33:23.457 --> 33:24.656
You blink, it's off the table.

33:24.658 --> 33:26.457
Come on, Vlad.

33:26.459 --> 33:29.828
Don't pretend
like you haven't done it before.

33:32.799 --> 33:37.769
Can you at least make it look
like I didn't break right away?

33:42.442 --> 33:44.775
I can't believe
they attacked Sid

33:44.777 --> 33:47.077
after he said he was
a police officer.

33:47.079 --> 33:49.147
Typical thug move--
take down the big man

33:49.149 --> 33:51.182
and dare anyone else
to step forward.

33:51.184 --> 33:53.618
They picked the wrong fight
when they went after my Sidney.

33:53.642 --> 33:54.319
Yeah.

33:54.320 --> 33:55.286
Let's get out of here, Sheila.

33:55.288 --> 33:56.787
Hospitals give me the creeps.

33:56.789 --> 33:59.723
I always feel I'm gonna come out
worse than when I went in.

33:59.725 --> 34:00.824
There he is.

34:00.826 --> 34:03.293
Looking good as new.
Yeah.

34:03.295 --> 34:04.795
Doctors found signs

34:04.797 --> 34:06.363
of minimal brain activity.

34:06.365 --> 34:09.331
I said that was normal
and said, "Send me home."

34:09.333 --> 34:10.934
Come on.

34:10.936 --> 34:13.270
The boss says take as much time
as you need coming back.

34:13.272 --> 34:15.605
And if you've had enough,
we'll support you going out

34:15.607 --> 34:17.306
on three-quarters disability.

34:17.309 --> 34:18.940
You mean take early retirement?

34:18.943 --> 34:19.909
Eh, it wouldn't really be early.

34:19.911 --> 34:21.511
You got 20
and then some.

34:21.513 --> 34:23.946
Oh, no. Please tell him
not to do that to me.

34:23.947 --> 34:26.216
No, not me either.
Thank God Sid's okay.

34:26.217 --> 34:28.751
But if I got him at home,
underfoot all the time,

34:28.753 --> 34:30.420
we are not gonna last,
I swear.

34:30.422 --> 34:34.056
Tell the boss I got gas in
the tank and miles to go.

34:34.059 --> 34:35.725
I'll give him the word.
We'll look forward

34:35.726 --> 34:37.726
to seeing you back at One PP
when you're ready.

34:37.728 --> 34:41.563
And, don't worry, we still got
plenty for you to do.

34:43.568 --> 34:44.867
Thanks, Anthony.

34:44.869 --> 34:47.036
Be well.

34:53.110 --> 34:54.943
Oh, no.

34:54.945 --> 34:57.613
Here comes the Suicide Squad,
yo.

34:57.615 --> 35:00.982
We came to try to talk
some sense back into you.

35:02.653 --> 35:04.652
You know, it's kind of
a mental illness to keep doing

35:04.654 --> 35:07.756
the same thing over and over
and expect a different result.

35:07.758 --> 35:09.357
Some people call it police work.

35:09.359 --> 35:11.659
I just call it stupid.

35:11.661 --> 35:12.728
You ought to know.

35:13.897 --> 35:15.931
Let's get
out of here.

35:15.933 --> 35:17.332
We'll see you around, Fausto.

35:25.208 --> 35:26.006
Drop it!

35:26.008 --> 35:28.175
<i>Tranquilo, amigos.</i>

35:30.714 --> 35:32.580
Drop your guns.
I'm not going anywhere.

35:32.582 --> 35:34.249
Son of a bitch. What'd you do?

35:34.251 --> 35:36.183
Saved you
some time, yo.

35:36.185 --> 35:38.853
Now you don't got to look
for no witnesses.

35:40.022 --> 35:41.138
Thought you were back
with his crew.

35:41.162 --> 35:42.023
I lied.

35:42.024 --> 35:44.258
Had to get him relaxed enough
so that he'd drop his guard.

35:44.260 --> 35:45.659
So you used us for a decoy?

35:45.661 --> 35:47.762
Maybe you convinced me
to stop being such a bitch.

35:47.764 --> 35:49.434
Anyway, it's over now.
Nothing's over.

35:49.457 --> 35:50.865
The only thing's over

35:50.867 --> 35:52.266
is your life.
5-4 detectives,

35:52.268 --> 35:53.367
I need a bus forthwith...

35:53.369 --> 35:55.168
Could've done this
the right way.

35:55.170 --> 35:56.870
Sorry, Reagan.
Had to do it my way.

35:56.872 --> 35:58.705
Once a gangster,
always a gangster.

35:58.707 --> 36:00.006
Know what I'm sayin'?

36:00.008 --> 36:02.509
Your choice.

36:02.511 --> 36:04.778
Guess you got revenge on that
son of a bitch for what he did to you.

36:04.780 --> 36:06.880
Wasn't
about me.

36:06.882 --> 36:09.082
We got this war to stop, yo.

36:09.084 --> 36:11.350
There's too many people like me
in this hood.

36:11.352 --> 36:13.253
Anyway, it's like you said,
Reagan,

36:13.255 --> 36:16.355
everyone wants to play the hero
sometime.

36:16.357 --> 36:19.659
Yeah. Come on,
get him out of here.

36:42.883 --> 36:45.650
What you got on?

36:47.454 --> 36:49.822
Squid on a Snell hook.

36:49.824 --> 36:52.157
Supposed to be stripers running.

36:55.963 --> 36:58.163
Any bites?

37:01.134 --> 37:04.101
I reached out
to that NYPD lieutenant

37:04.103 --> 37:05.704
in the cabby arrest.

37:05.706 --> 37:06.705
And?

37:06.707 --> 37:08.773
Turns out he didn't have
the appetite

37:08.775 --> 37:11.042
for signing
the supporting deposition.

37:11.044 --> 37:13.645
They let Salem out
a couple hours ago.

37:13.647 --> 37:15.279
I'm not surprised.

37:15.281 --> 37:17.548
From your description, it
sounded like our lieutenant

37:17.550 --> 37:20.517
was just going along with
the arrest, not driving it.

37:21.387 --> 37:23.321
You were right.

37:23.323 --> 37:25.156
Well,

37:25.158 --> 37:27.325
I don't know.

37:28.995 --> 37:32.529
I had misgivings when
you decided to come on the job.

37:32.531 --> 37:33.797
Still do.

37:35.901 --> 37:37.568
Like?

37:37.570 --> 37:40.103
Like in this line of work,

37:40.105 --> 37:41.772
perfect is the enemy of good.

37:41.774 --> 37:43.640
As in, you try to be perfect,

37:43.642 --> 37:46.142
you're not gonna do much good.

37:47.913 --> 37:49.913
How's that me?

37:49.915 --> 37:52.382
Well, you always want it

37:52.384 --> 37:55.085
to turn out right every time.

37:55.087 --> 37:56.652
Doesn't happen.

37:56.654 --> 37:58.721
Never has,
never will.

37:58.723 --> 38:01.224
Nothing does.

38:01.226 --> 38:03.126
A lawyer,

38:03.128 --> 38:05.495
a courtroom-- it's just...

38:05.497 --> 38:07.029
it's more civil.

38:07.031 --> 38:08.564
A loss happens, someone's

38:08.566 --> 38:11.467
led out of the courtroom
by a court officer.

38:11.469 --> 38:15.204
You can pop an antacid
or head to the bar.

38:16.040 --> 38:18.808
But in this job,

38:18.810 --> 38:21.277
a loss comes with blood
and tears

38:21.279 --> 38:25.247
and a lot of stuff,
once you see, you don't unsee.

38:28.052 --> 38:31.387
I know that.

38:32.223 --> 38:35.224
I know you do.

38:35.226 --> 38:37.426
I know you do.

38:40.564 --> 38:45.567
But there are things
I admire about you

38:45.569 --> 38:50.839
that this job will eat away at
until they are gone.

38:53.544 --> 38:57.011
Long as it's my choice.

38:58.848 --> 39:01.549
Always will be.

39:01.551 --> 39:05.553
Just my two cents.

39:07.657 --> 39:10.524
How do you do it, Dad?
How do you...

39:10.526 --> 39:12.359
pile up the losses?

39:12.361 --> 39:15.429
I put 'em in a box
and I nail the box shut

39:15.431 --> 39:16.831
and I don't think about 'em.

39:16.833 --> 39:18.699
Just the way I'm built.

39:18.701 --> 39:21.301
I thought this conversation
was starting to have

39:21.303 --> 39:24.171
a whiff of honesty about it.

39:27.743 --> 39:29.709
Some days,

39:29.711 --> 39:34.948
I have to remind myself where
the box and the nails are kept.

39:38.354 --> 39:40.620
Ah.

39:40.622 --> 39:42.822
Some days.
