00:30.208 --> 00:33.208
[Olivia] You know that moment
when you finally understand
life?

00:34.875 --> 00:36.000
You just get it?

00:38.834 --> 00:41.750
Well, this was my moment.

00:42.333 --> 00:45.917
I got it. Everything and
everyone
in my life fit into a neat,
little box.

00:46.542 --> 00:48.917
Here are the individualist
hipster clones...

00:49.709 --> 00:51.583
and the better-than-you bankers.

00:51.583 --> 00:53.875
[scoffs] See?

00:55.542 --> 00:58.208
I knew exactly what was what,
who was who
and most importantly who I am.

00:58.875 --> 01:00.834
Aw, the yummy mummies.

01:00.834 --> 01:01.959
[indistinct chatter]

01:02.709 --> 01:03.709
[Olivia] Look, we all do it.

01:03.709 --> 01:06.875
We give ourselves labels
to feel we belong.

01:07.375 --> 01:10.542
Silly, really. Because waking up
to yourself is about letting go

01:10.542 --> 01:12.458
of who you imagine yourself to
be.

01:13.125 --> 01:15.709
Of course, I had yet to learn
that.

01:16.041 --> 01:20.917
Yep. No. I'm up.
I'm gonna take on the world.

01:21.375 --> 01:23.625
[water bubbling]

01:24.709 --> 01:26.375
[urinating]

01:27.166 --> 01:28.417
Oh!

01:35.792 --> 01:37.250
["Do You Wanna Dance" playing]

02:13.375 --> 02:14.417
Fuck!

02:39.792 --> 02:41.000
[grunts]

02:41.000 --> 02:42.291
Look smart, everyone! She's
almost here.

02:44.917 --> 02:46.375
-Could I get that deposition,
Charles?
-Yes, yes.

02:46.375 --> 02:49.500
Could I get a smile too
for Sophie's last day?

02:51.125 --> 02:53.458
Terrifying as usual. Thank you.

03:05.625 --> 03:06.709
[sighs]

03:22.125 --> 03:23.208
[all] Surprise!

03:23.458 --> 03:28.166
You do not do that to someone!
Oh! [laughs]

03:31.333 --> 03:33.208
I'll be sad to leave the firm.

03:33.208 --> 03:35.000
Glad to see the back of you lot,
of course.

03:35.000 --> 03:35.500
-[laughing]
-Yay!

03:37.208 --> 03:40.583
Yes, Olivia, thank you for the
surprise.
I can tell you were the one
behind it.

03:40.583 --> 03:41.375
[laughs]

03:43.750 --> 03:45.792
[heavy breathing]

03:52.500 --> 03:54.875
[Sophie] And now for another
surprise...

03:55.875 --> 03:57.542
I'm gonna be a mum.
That's right. I'm having a baby.

03:58.208 --> 04:01.417
-[applause]
-Thank you.

04:02.250 --> 04:04.500
[squealing]

04:14.250 --> 04:15.375
[snorts]

04:20.333 --> 04:21.416
Yay!

04:28.083 --> 04:32.041
Shoo! Go on. Shoo! Go on!
Fuck off! Go get the mouse
that's...

04:32.750 --> 04:34.458
-not this one.
-[cat meows]

04:35.959 --> 04:37.959
That was rather embarrassing,
wasn't it?

04:38.750 --> 04:40.125
-Excruciating stuff.
-Yes.

04:40.959 --> 04:43.458
Thank you. Much better
adjective.

04:45.625 --> 04:49.458
-It is possible, you know.
-Yeah! Sure, yes. I mean...

04:51.083 --> 04:53.041
that was always the plan. Um...

04:56.000 --> 04:59.208
but then you wake up after yet
another pointless relationship

04:59.208 --> 05:00.291
and you realize...

05:01.542 --> 05:04.208
the only thing you ever truly
wanted,
you left up to fate.

05:04.542 --> 05:05.625
And now it's too late.

05:06.625 --> 05:10.625
-No chance with the current?
-She's barely 12.

05:11.709 --> 05:16.458
Unfortunately, I am completely
obsessed
with her.

05:18.625 --> 05:20.625
-Finally happy.
-You don't look very happy.

05:24.458 --> 05:24.500
So...

05:27.250 --> 05:28.375
who's the man then?

05:28.917 --> 05:29.959
No man.

05:31.250 --> 05:33.166
A woman needs a man like a fish
needs a bicycle and all that.

05:33.166 --> 05:38.667
-Yes, but who's like a man?
-We are, quite literally, two
women.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.959
Yes, but top or bottom sort of
thing.
I mean, how does it fit
together?

05:47.875 --> 05:50.083
Charles, please. Stop doing
that.

05:52.458 --> 05:55.417
-What do you call this piece?
-Dot.

05:56.125 --> 05:57.667
-Do you know what it represents?
-What?

05:57.959 --> 06:00.875
-Fuck all!
-Don't say that.

06:00.875 --> 06:03.625
I literally spent all day,
creating a full stop.

06:03.625 --> 06:06.375
But this what being a
struggling artist
is all about.

06:06.375 --> 06:08.166
Yeah, but when do you
stop saying "struggling"

06:08.166 --> 06:11.166
-and just realize that you are
not one.
-Never.

06:11.667 --> 06:13.041
If I'm all right with it,
you can be too, you know.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.750
Alex, that's not who you are.

06:18.041 --> 06:19.542
[sighs] How was your day?

06:22.875 --> 06:24.709
Lovely, thank you.

06:25.750 --> 06:28.542
Um... I did get us a new pet.

06:30.125 --> 06:31.542
Her name's Maureen.

06:32.208 --> 06:35.458
There are ways to address
procrastination,
as we discussed.

06:35.458 --> 06:35.542
Are there?

06:38.375 --> 06:39.333
Are there?

06:42.542 --> 06:44.500

06:48.041 --> 06:49.709
-[screams]
-[giggling]

07:16.083 --> 07:18.250
-I know...
-You do?

07:18.750 --> 07:20.917
I need to get up and face the
world.

07:28.083 --> 07:29.625
Actually, um...

07:32.041 --> 07:33.709
I was going to ask you to marry
me.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.792
-Have you got a ring?
-Yes! No, I don't. It...

07:43.291 --> 07:47.875
-More of an "in theory"
situation.
-You just proposed to me in
theory?

07:47.875 --> 07:51.834
I mean, do you think we should?
Because, then we'll be as close
as...

07:53.291 --> 07:56.166
you know, family and we could...

07:59.417 --> 08:00.959
All those lovely tax benefits.

08:01.583 --> 08:03.667
-You've not proposed before,
have you?
-Is it too soon?

08:04.583 --> 08:08.041
It is too soon. Yep. It
probably...

08:09.458 --> 08:12.458
Ignore me. I've had a lot of
coffee.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.625
And now you're literally taking
your proposal back?

08:14.625 --> 08:16.583
Got me divorce papers through,
this morning.

08:17.583 --> 08:21.458
-John!
-Most people just say good
morning, John!

08:21.875 --> 08:23.500
As long as she gives me
my signed football back, I'm
happy.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.250
[Olivia] Oh, I'm sure she will.

08:26.583 --> 08:28.959
-So, you're a single man, now?
-Yeah!

08:28.959 --> 08:31.208
Gosh! You can party, date and...

08:32.000 --> 08:35.667
-[stuttering] ...travel the
world.
-Grow my hair a bit.

08:35.917 --> 08:37.166
-[Olivia] And that.
-Have a divorce party.

08:37.166 --> 08:39.291
Oh, that's classy.

08:39.291 --> 08:40.792
-Thank you!
-[Alex] Goodbye, John!

08:42.500 --> 08:42.792
[John] What you doin'?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.917
Are you two doing stuff?

09:24.458 --> 09:27.709
[Olivia] Look at him. Mr.
Family Man.

09:28.375 --> 09:30.834
If we were still kids, I'd go
over there
and give him a wedgie.

09:31.750 --> 09:32.875
Those trousers are doing the
job for you.

09:35.083 --> 09:40.333
-Do you ever think about that?
-You brother's ass. Daily, yeah.

09:40.917 --> 09:42.166
I wish I had the courage to be
different,

09:42.166 --> 09:46.208
to stand alone and accept that
I have
feelings for men.

09:46.834 --> 09:50.000
-I just can't deal with the
stigma.
-Just 'cause, lately I've been--

09:52.083 --> 09:56.000
I've just been thinking, I
don't know,
what a great mum you'd make.

10:01.166 --> 10:02.542
So that's what it was about.

10:04.250 --> 10:05.917
-What?
-The anti-proposal.

10:08.125 --> 10:10.458
-No.
-That's why you had no ring.

10:11.083 --> 10:13.959
Look, were we-- You know, I
don't--
We haven't broached that, have
we?

10:14.709 --> 10:19.667
-The kid thing? Have we covered
that?
-Uh, yeah. Date two.

10:19.917 --> 10:23.917

but like, not for years.

Okay.

I'm sorry. I know you're not
ready.

This is a thing, isn't it?

12:39.667 --> 12:42.333
No, Alf. She asked for a baby.
Not a kidney.

That would be way less hassle.

behave.

anything done

I think those two will fancy you
whatever.

14:48.750 --> 14:51.750
Alex, I need you to be the
person
that you plan to be sooner.

14:52.041 --> 14:53.083
Why?

14:53.625 --> 14:56.250

because you're going to be a
mother.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.500
How could you do this?

15:18.792 --> 15:20.208
Huh?

15:21.041 --> 15:22.667
You promised me time to think.

15:23.250 --> 15:26.333
I just thought I'd give it a
shot and see.

15:26.625 --> 15:29.250
-[scoffs] This is our life.
-Alex, I couldn't wait.

15:32.959 --> 15:34.041
Not any longer.

fucking great at.

Okay, okay, okay, okay.

15:48.959 --> 15:49.583
I'm going to go back to our
house
and give us both time to cool
off.

15:49.583 --> 15:51.625
I don't wanna see you.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.125
-Fine. I'll go to my parents.
-Fine.

15:56.458 --> 15:58.291
Fuck!

-Ah-ha! Where's Olivia?
-Huh! I've been left behind.

who the fuck we are for a bit?

-Oh! Most definitely.
-Fantastic!

[birds chirping]

16:35.709 --> 16:38.458
-[Sue] Green juice, darling?
-No, thanks, Mummy.

16:38.458 --> 16:42.333
-Nice to have our princess home.
-Just the damn best.

16:42.834 --> 16:45.291
Wish you had an argument
with your flatmate every week.

16:45.291 --> 16:48.333
-Girlfriend.
-Life partner, darling.

16:48.792 --> 16:51.500
Well, we'll be here when
it doesn't work out, won't we,
love?

16:51.500 --> 16:52.709
[Sue] Absolutely!

16:58.208 --> 16:59.333
[snoring]

17:04.000 --> 17:04.165
Good morning, Alex.

17:05.834 --> 17:06.916
[gasping]

17:12.165 --> 17:13.125
Do you wanna go again?

17:14.208 --> 17:14.333
Oh, my God.

17:24.666 --> 17:27.040
-Oh, thank God!
-[sobbing]

17:27.875 --> 17:31.250
Oh, Alex, I can't believe I did
that
without telling you.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.291
-I'm so sorry.
-I'm so sorry.

17:33.291 --> 17:35.291
-I'm so sorry.
-So sorry.

17:35.291 --> 17:35.375
So sorry?

17:37.917 --> 17:40.667
Let's just have a baby. Huh?
Let's do whatever you want.

17:41.125 --> 17:41.208
Whatever it takes.

17:42.333 --> 17:46.792
-Really?
-Let's mess up your VJ, good
and proper.

17:47.750 --> 17:49.625
That's a yes.

17:51.542 --> 17:53.458
Yay!

17:54.041 --> 17:56.667
[sobbing]

17:57.542 --> 18:00.917
Thank you! Because, Alex...

18:02.709 --> 18:04.291
this is about you.

18:05.083 --> 18:08.875
I can't do this without you
being part of it, you know?

18:10.583 --> 18:12.083
-It'll be easy, right?
-Yes!

18:12.083 --> 18:15.250
Having a baby is just like
having a mate
around who's always pissed.

18:15.750 --> 18:18.625
They just need propping up now
and again,
and given fluids.

18:19.458 --> 18:21.166
-Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.
-Sweet!

18:30.417 --> 18:33.291
[Olivia] So I would ask you to
find him
accountable for what he did.

18:33.291 --> 18:36.500
In summation, clause 14 states
that--
[burps]

18:39.250 --> 18:40.500
That's not what it states.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.250
Clause 14-- [heaves]

18:42.667 --> 18:44.792
[heaves]

18:44.792 --> 18:47.208
[judge] Are you able
to continue, Miss Miller?

18:47.792 --> 18:48.875
[heaves]

18:49.333 --> 18:50.667
[jury murmuring]

18:56.500 --> 18:57.333
Um...

18:58.125 --> 19:00.208
no, actually.

19:01.458 --> 19:04.417
My colleague will tell you
about that clause.

19:04.417 --> 19:07.333
If you will please excuse me,
I have to vomit.

19:22.625 --> 19:24.542
There's more out here
if you need 'em babe.

19:25.583 --> 19:28.417
Say a prayer to the god of
fertility.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.458
That's not gonna happen. Go!

19:39.917 --> 19:41.375
[lighter clicks]

19:46.959 --> 19:47.959
[chokes]

20:06.000 --> 20:08.750
-[footsteps approaching]
-It's positive!

20:09.667 --> 20:12.250
I'm pregnant! [heavy breathing]

20:12.250 --> 20:14.625
Snap. I'm pregnant.

20:15.542 --> 20:18.208
No, I am. I am pregnant.

20:19.542 --> 20:20.417
[heavy breathing]

20:22.125 --> 20:22.375
What?

20:27.875 --> 20:31.709
-I don't understand what
happened.
-Oh, poor you. You're all
confused.

20:32.041 --> 20:36.417
Meanwhile, you have just put
my entire life in a salad
spinner of fuck!

20:36.959 --> 20:39.125
I was so drunk.

20:40.083 --> 20:42.208
And you went behind my back
and that really hurt.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.542
So, you thought you'd sleep
with a man
you nicknamed scrotum pole?

20:45.000 --> 20:47.458
I don't remember anything.

20:47.709 --> 20:50.375
[Olivia] You remembered how to
fuck,
obviously!

20:50.792 --> 20:55.917
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

20:55.917 --> 20:58.125
Look how much you're fucking
making me swear!

20:58.750 --> 21:00.875
[gasping]

21:01.875 --> 21:04.792
I just don't understand why you
keep
messing everything up for
yourself.

21:04.792 --> 21:06.375
[gasping]

21:09.000 --> 21:10.792
-Oh, what's this?
-Bag.

21:10.792 --> 21:12.750
-What?
-Bag. Paper bag.

21:12.750 --> 21:13.959
[gasping continues]

21:24.542 --> 21:25.375
Just--

21:27.000 --> 21:29.750
-We were so good together.
-I know.

21:30.750 --> 21:32.417
-I know
-[gasping continues]

21:42.458 --> 21:45.000
You can't be the one to comfort
me
over you.

21:48.458 --> 21:51.375
["Run" playing]

22:14.917 --> 22:17.417
Oh, yes!

22:18.834 --> 22:20.667
Olivia, look.

22:22.458 --> 22:26.500
-She gave me my ball back.
-That's fantastic! I'm so happy
for you.

22:29.583 --> 22:30.458
Let's have a look.

22:37.250 --> 22:38.333
Okay.

22:41.250 --> 22:42.625
Can I have my ball back now?

22:45.500 --> 22:47.041
So just go romcom on her arse.

22:47.625 --> 22:48.500
'Scuse me?

22:49.000 --> 22:52.667
The big romantic gesture.
Richard Gere, roses,

22:53.000 --> 22:54.166
so she no longer feels like a
hooker.

22:54.417 --> 22:57.375
Then I'm literally gonna be a
mum
to two kids. Just like that.

22:57.875 --> 22:59.625
-You're already having one.
-Not without her, I'm not.

23:02.375 --> 23:04.959
Does that make me a shitty
person?

23:05.208 --> 23:08.291
It's not a story I'd tell them
at their graduation but no...

23:09.041 --> 23:10.166
you're all right.

23:10.875 --> 23:11.500
I don't know what to do.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.000
Can you be without her?

23:16.583 --> 23:18.291
-No.
-Not a chance?

23:20.166 --> 23:22.333
-Not one.
-There you go then.

23:23.166 --> 23:24.458
And now...

23:25.709 --> 23:26.542
to celebrate.

23:27.750 --> 23:31.792
-I'm gonna have a baby, Alf.
-Yeah, I know. I sympathize.

23:33.041 --> 23:33.583
This'll make you feel better.

23:36.625 --> 23:37.500
Yep.

23:47.083 --> 23:49.208
[door slams shut]

23:52.917 --> 23:54.750
Whoa!

23:56.417 --> 23:58.000
That is so not cool.

24:15.458 --> 24:18.333
I can't sell a single painting.

24:18.834 --> 24:20.583
Not even the one with me tits
out.

24:21.125 --> 24:25.625
So, I sold all those cool art
supplies
and I got you this.

24:26.792 --> 24:30.667
I can't do this on me own.
And I don't think you can,
either.

24:32.333 --> 24:34.959
[birds chirping]

24:42.375 --> 24:43.792
Have you smelled this thing?

24:45.291 --> 24:47.417
It's vintage, isn't it?

24:50.417 --> 24:52.625
[keys jingling]

25:03.333 --> 25:04.417
[door slams shut]

25:05.875 --> 25:07.500
And why exactly do you think
I wouldn't be able to do this
on my own?

25:08.125 --> 25:11.375
I have support.
Friends, my family, friends.

25:11.667 --> 25:12.875
-Which friends?
-Friends.

25:13.750 --> 25:14.625
Maureen?

25:16.000 --> 25:17.542
Well what do you bring, Alex?

25:17.542 --> 25:19.417
And you need to get that
fucking mouse
out of my house.

25:20.709 --> 25:20.834
I'm home all day.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.125
Got a thing for Pixar.

25:24.625 --> 25:25.792
To be honest, I hadn't thought
beyond the pram.

25:27.959 --> 25:30.667
I just know that if you were
ever able
to forgive me,

25:30.667 --> 25:34.208
then I would love
to be the mum that you think I
can be.

25:35.834 --> 25:39.709
So, I'd like to call today,
"Lez be having some babies!"

25:40.000 --> 25:42.250
-No jokes.
-Understood. Not a laughing
matter.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.542
-Alex.
-Present.

25:45.208 --> 25:49.083
Yep. We've established that.
My sister has asked me to do
this

25:49.458 --> 25:53.375
quite heinous bit of mediation
today,
so you can both be sure you're
entering

25:53.375 --> 25:55.041
-into this agreement--
-Family. Family.

25:55.667 --> 25:59.041
Bit of a stretch but anyway...
with clarity and closure.

25:59.458 --> 26:00.583
Yeah, fine. I'll agree to
anything.

26:00.959 --> 26:04.041
How romantic. Now here are the
hard
and fast rules.

26:04.333 --> 26:07.083
Never again shall either of you
mention
that Alex slept with someone
else.

26:07.375 --> 26:09.625
-[Alex] Fine.
-You have to meet each other's
parents.

26:10.667 --> 26:12.959
-Fine.
-And you have to tell John
about the baby.

26:12.959 --> 26:15.500
-No fucking way!
-He's the father.

26:16.166 --> 26:19.333
We're talking about the man who
thought
LGBT was just a really big
sandwich.

26:19.333 --> 26:21.166
You slept with him.

26:22.333 --> 26:23.208
Oh! I think we agreed no more
mention
of the S word.

26:23.208 --> 26:25.291
-Shut up, Ben!
-That's mature.

26:25.542 --> 26:28.250
Why would you want him involved?
He almost ruined us.

26:28.667 --> 26:32.542
How else are we going
to afford two children on one
salary?

26:32.542 --> 26:35.291
Well, we don't need childcare.
I'll look after them.

26:35.291 --> 26:36.792
No Alex, you're an artist.

26:38.583 --> 26:40.375
You can't give up your dream.

26:43.208 --> 26:44.667
You are my dream.

26:44.917 --> 26:45.792
-[Ben scoffs]
-Shut up, Ben.

26:45.792 --> 26:47.917
You two are perfect for each
other.

26:49.083 --> 26:53.417
I want to do this properly.
One has to do the right thing.

26:54.125 --> 26:55.583
You've started talking like the
Queen.

26:56.792 --> 26:56.917
Must be serious.

26:58.792 --> 27:00.291
That's her serious face, too.

27:00.709 --> 27:01.834
Or she's having a stroke.

27:02.250 --> 27:04.875
-Shut up!
-Okay, why am I here?

27:08.125 --> 27:09.959
[women chatting]

27:15.291 --> 27:17.834
-Hey, John.
-Oh, hey!

27:18.125 --> 27:20.834
-I'm so glad you're talking to
me again.
-[seductively] Who's the daddy?

27:21.250 --> 27:23.333
-You what?
-[seductively] Who's the daddy?

27:24.458 --> 27:25.500
Huh?

27:28.625 --> 27:32.166
Who. Is. The. Daddy?

27:33.291 --> 27:35.750
I am the daddy.

27:36.917 --> 27:39.458
-Yes, you are.
-Excuse me?

27:39.709 --> 27:42.208
She's pregnant.
You are going to be a daddy.

27:42.667 --> 27:44.959
And we're gonna need shitloads
of money.

27:47.083 --> 27:47.583
[chuckles]

27:47.875 --> 27:50.834
-Well, I did it.
-Yes, you did.

27:50.834 --> 27:51.875
Mm-hmm.

27:55.375 --> 27:58.583
-Why can we never do that?
-[doorbell rings]

27:59.709 --> 28:01.500
[knocking at door]

28:03.000 --> 28:06.542
-I thought you meant sexually.
-No, she didn't. That was our
joke.

28:07.083 --> 28:07.834
You did not mean sexually?

28:08.333 --> 28:10.583
I had sex with that.

28:11.750 --> 28:13.875
And now there's a baby gonna be
coming
out of that.

28:13.875 --> 28:17.959
Yes, thank you for the biology
lecture.
Come in before you throw up on
that.

28:22.417 --> 28:25.208
Look, mate... I don't expect
anything.

28:25.208 --> 28:26.959
-[Olivia clears her throat]
-Maybe money.

28:27.667 --> 28:30.000
-You work in banking, right?
-No, not anymore.

28:31.834 --> 28:34.083
No. I own and run a site called
Mannism.

28:34.875 --> 28:35.000
It's um...

28:36.375 --> 28:40.000
It's a-- It's a-- A place
where alpha males can connect
and...

28:42.625 --> 28:44.375
share the message of the
ancient Greek word, " Arete".

28:45.041 --> 28:48.291
-"Be the best you can be."
-So, money's out then.

28:48.959 --> 28:50.041
[sniffs] Well...

28:51.208 --> 28:51.917
you keep doing that.

28:53.166 --> 28:55.083
Because, I'm perfectly cool
raising this baby with Olivia.

28:57.125 --> 28:58.250
-I'm also having a baby.
-Bollocks.

28:58.667 --> 29:00.542
Actually, it's certain.

29:02.125 --> 29:05.417
No, not that. Congrats or
whatever.
Bollocks to me not playing a
part.

29:05.417 --> 29:08.083
I am the father!
That little one needs a dad.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.500
Please. Please let me be the
dad.
Plus, I live right next door.

29:14.208 --> 29:15.041
I have a complex vocabulary.

29:18.875 --> 29:22.458
You can't drive. I can drive
you!
If you want.

29:22.458 --> 29:26.375
[Olivia whispering] Get him out
of this house, now!

29:26.375 --> 29:28.875
-I've heard enough. He knows
now.
-Yes.

29:29.166 --> 29:30.041
Off you go, John.

29:31.625 --> 29:34.625
-I cannot believe that is the
man who--
-Turned your girlfriend
straight?

29:34.625 --> 29:36.458
-Oh, my God!
-That's what she said.

29:36.458 --> 29:37.875
Sorry, that was right there.

29:38.250 --> 29:41.583
I am so incredibly sorry for
the pain
that I have caused you.

29:41.583 --> 29:44.917
If I could go back in time
and change what happened, I
would. But...

29:47.375 --> 29:48.583
I'm a great guy.

29:48.917 --> 29:53.250
Let me take you out to lunch,
clear the air, get to know me
better.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.125
Yeah? I want to be a part of
this.

29:57.583 --> 29:58.667
This is...

29:59.500 --> 30:00.500
kind of all I've got.

30:00.500 --> 30:03.125
-Aside from Mannism?
-Hail to the Alpha.

30:03.417 --> 30:05.917
-[sighs]
-Give me a chance?

30:06.667 --> 30:10.083
Go on. Give me a chance.

30:11.333 --> 30:13.375
[Olivia] Aw.

30:14.625 --> 30:16.959
Is it supposed to look like
an underwater alien?

30:16.959 --> 30:18.959
Yes. It is quite revolting,
isn't it?

30:18.959 --> 30:22.041
So, Alex, that membrane which
is protecting the fetus

30:22.041 --> 30:23.834
is known as the amniotic sac.

30:24.291 --> 30:26.792
-That's mingin'. Stop it.
-Yes. Please stop.

30:29.166 --> 30:31.083
-So, you're pregnant too?
-I am.

30:31.875 --> 30:34.250
-And you're both together?
-We are.

30:34.250 --> 30:35.333
-Yes.
-And both pregnant with...

30:35.834 --> 30:37.000
some other people's children?

30:38.667 --> 30:42.458
Well, it's not quite that
random.
I was artificially inseminated
by a donor.

30:42.458 --> 30:47.709
Oh, yes. Thank you. No need to
elaborate.
Very feminist, I'm sure.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.834
Okay, well. Thank you very much.

30:55.667 --> 30:56.417
Are you wearing an underwire
bra?

30:57.208 --> 31:00.208
-Sorry?
-You should stop during
pregnancy.

31:00.208 --> 31:02.959
It restricts the growth of milk
glands
in your--

31:04.667 --> 31:06.750
-Breasts.
-Hmm.

31:08.375 --> 31:10.458
[clears throat] You need to know
these things. You can't ignore
pregnancy.

31:10.458 --> 31:12.166
Sadly.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.041
Um, if my waters break
while I'm out and about,

31:15.041 --> 31:18.375
uh, will it look
like I've just pissed myself?

31:19.333 --> 31:23.083
It's more of a trickle than a--
Oh, dear God-- Gush.

31:23.083 --> 31:27.542
And um, during labor,
is it correct that...

31:28.333 --> 31:30.125
-one can crap oneself?
-I'll give you some leaflets,
okay?

31:31.041 --> 31:34.875
Did you know,
I have a painting of my vulva

31:34.875 --> 31:37.709
that would look absolutely
gorgeous
in here?

31:37.709 --> 31:40.166
-No, thank you. Goodbye.
Toodle-oo.
-Okay, buh-bye. Bye.

31:44.542 --> 31:48.500
[Olivia] How'd we manage to
find the one
obstetrician who's weird about
vaginas?

31:48.500 --> 31:51.375
[both laughing hysterically]

31:52.083 --> 31:52.166
[snorts]

32:11.250 --> 32:16.000
Saturdays at 11:00 a.m. Got it.
Thank you. Bye.

32:17.417 --> 32:18.875
-Hello!
-Hello there!

32:21.709 --> 32:23.333
I'm really pleased we got to do
this.

32:23.667 --> 32:25.792
-I'm pleased we could do this,
too.
-Yeah.

32:26.709 --> 32:29.500
I appreciated your apology.

32:30.542 --> 32:32.834
Well, I appreciate you saying
that.

32:34.250 --> 32:37.333
-Great! I am starving.
-Sandwiches.

32:39.583 --> 32:40.875
-Oh. This is stilton?
-Yeah.

32:40.875 --> 32:42.250
I don't think I can have it.

32:42.250 --> 32:44.834
Alex was just going on about
this
yesterday.

32:45.333 --> 32:47.291
-What, 'cause of the--
-Yeah.

32:47.291 --> 32:50.208
-Oh, I'm so sorry.
-That's okay. I can still have
the bread.

32:50.208 --> 32:51.917
I'll just take this.

33:07.542 --> 33:09.375
Yes, um...

33:11.041 --> 33:15.792
-Alex is become quite the
pregnancy major.
-That girl's hilarious. Never
serious.

33:16.417 --> 33:17.250
She can be quite serious,
though.

33:17.792 --> 33:22.458
No. I think even when she's
serious,
it's a little un-serious.

33:22.458 --> 33:24.458
Well, maybe you don't take
what she's saying seriously.

33:24.458 --> 33:26.417
I'm pretty certain she's just
being fun
and not serious.

33:26.417 --> 33:29.166
-Well, she does laugh a lot.
-Yeah.

33:30.458 --> 33:33.917
-Like a little squeaky mouse.
-It's quite a big laugh
actually, I'd say.

33:34.291 --> 33:36.875
It's big for her,
but pretty small, generally.

33:36.875 --> 33:39.291
I'd say if it's big for her,
it's big for anyone.

33:39.291 --> 33:40.166
-Really?
-Yeah.

33:41.583 --> 33:43.250
I think, it's more like...
[high-pitched laugh] Something
like that.

33:43.250 --> 33:46.792
Obviously, I've been making her
laugh
a lot. But it's nothing like
that.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.542
No, I hear it quite a lot
like...
[high-pitched laugh]

33:49.542 --> 33:52.959
-It's more of a-- It's, uh,
lower.
-No.

33:53.417 --> 33:57.834
Guttural, sort of...
[low-pitched laugh]

33:58.500 --> 34:00.333
-That sort of...
-No, it's... [high-pitched
laugh]

34:00.333 --> 34:01.500
It's not like that.

34:01.500 --> 34:05.125
[both feign laughter]

34:12.041 --> 34:15.125
[laughter becomes amorous
moaning]

34:16.833 --> 34:18.208
No, I'm thinking of something
else.

34:28.417 --> 34:33.125
So... how was he then?
Big fella? Nice moves?

34:33.875 --> 34:37.250
-Mum, you're kind of missing
the point.
-Best news I've heard all year.

34:38.458 --> 34:41.208
-That's great to hear.
-You shagged a bloke.

34:41.208 --> 34:42.417
You're back to yourself again.

34:42.750 --> 34:44.875
What are talking about?
I've never been into blokes.

34:45.166 --> 34:46.667
Oh! What about Turner's son?

34:46.667 --> 34:50.417
I was five. He taught me how to
piss
in the sea discretely.

34:50.417 --> 34:53.250
It was hardly a grand romance.
It was more of a very useful
life tool.

34:53.250 --> 34:56.708
Well... I just think
we've turned a corner, that's
all.

34:57.542 --> 35:00.041
So... are you getting it dealt
with?

35:01.375 --> 35:05.041
No. I'm having it
and raising it with Olivia.

35:07.750 --> 35:09.458
Listen. Listen to me.

35:10.333 --> 35:12.500
Now you know I love you, don't
you?

35:13.083 --> 35:15.291
And I will support any decision
you ever make.

35:16.125 --> 35:19.375
I just think two women raising
a child together is fucking
disgusting.

35:19.875 --> 35:20.875
And we're back.

35:22.083 --> 35:23.083
I mean what're you gonna do
when it asks where its daddy is?

35:23.792 --> 35:25.250
John is going to be a part of
their life.

35:25.250 --> 35:28.792
-Oh, so he's still skulking
around, is he?
-No. Not like that.

35:28.792 --> 35:32.458
All I'm saying
is don't close off all your
options.

35:33.625 --> 35:35.750
Sort yourself out,
concentrate on your career

35:36.291 --> 35:39.083
and see if you can have a
proper baby
one day.

35:53.750 --> 35:54.875
[Alex] What am I gonna teach a
kid?

35:54.875 --> 35:57.291
I'm gonna be a mum
before I've been anything else.

35:57.291 --> 35:58.250
[Olivia]
Oh, that's not true.

35:59.083 --> 36:01.625
You were a stoner for a while.

36:01.625 --> 36:02.458
[chuckling]

36:03.667 --> 36:05.750
Ah, see, John was definitely
not impersonating your laugh.

36:08.375 --> 36:11.166
Sorry.
Are you gonna finish that?

36:11.667 --> 36:13.291
No. Knock yourself out.

36:14.750 --> 36:16.667
I'm only craving rabbit food
at the moment.

36:18.333 --> 36:19.291
[mumbling] I hate you.

36:23.041 --> 36:24.166
[Olivia groans]

36:25.333 --> 36:27.333
That just makes me pee myself.

36:27.959 --> 36:32.166
-That can scientifically not be
true.
-Well, something is making me
pee myself.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.125
You know...

36:37.041 --> 36:39.083
I actually don't have any
sympathy
for you.

36:40.834 --> 36:42.291
You're gonna have this baby...

36:43.000 --> 36:45.709
your body will snap back
and then you got the kid box
ticked.

36:46.875 --> 36:49.625
Do you have any idea how many
thirty-something women

36:49.625 --> 36:51.792
are on horrendous dates right
now?

36:52.542 --> 36:56.166
One eye on the clock and one
eye on some
dull bloke sitting opposite
them thinking,

36:56.166 --> 36:58.875
"Oh, crap. He'll have to do."

36:59.709 --> 37:02.750
Or lesbians frantically
googling,
"Sperm donors with Oxbridge
degrees".

37:02.750 --> 37:04.583
Exactly.

37:06.709 --> 37:08.625
[siren wailing in the distance]

37:09.000 --> 37:11.375
-Do you know her?
-No, but she's pregnant.

37:11.709 --> 37:12.792
So?

37:14.417 --> 37:15.542
That's what you do when you're
pregnant,
you wave at each other, like
cabbies.

37:16.583 --> 37:18.417
Hmm.

37:19.709 --> 37:23.333
"Labor". Yeah.
Even the word makes us feel
tense.

37:24.417 --> 37:27.208
This course is gonna equip you
with all the tools and
techniques

37:27.208 --> 37:29.959
that you need to challenge
the contemporary
over-medicalized,

37:29.959 --> 37:31.750
fear-based, birthing culture

37:31.750 --> 37:34.583
and to remind your body
to let it all go, guys.

37:34.583 --> 37:36.917
Now, no questions till the end
Please remember the rules.

37:36.917 --> 37:40.250
So, some of you are sitting here
in like a refrigerator of terror

37:41.083 --> 37:42.250
and some of you will
be sitting here, doubting,

37:42.625 --> 37:46.041
whether hypnobirthing works at
all.
Well...

37:47.750 --> 37:48.625
it-- It does.

37:50.166 --> 37:52.500
It does. Let's start
with the introductions, Alex.

37:52.500 --> 37:53.917
-This is Alex.
-Hi.

37:54.333 --> 37:58.583
And this is Alex's female life
partner,
Olivia.

37:58.583 --> 37:59.417
Huh!

38:00.667 --> 38:02.250
I'm just so happy and humbled
to have you in my group, guys.

38:02.250 --> 38:03.375
Oh! Thank you.

38:04.750 --> 38:08.458
Oh, and this is Mike and Maya,
Morgan and Amanda, and
Allison...

38:10.458 --> 38:13.041
-Dave.
-and Dave. I know that.

38:13.041 --> 38:14.667
I know that. Right.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.875
Let's talk about pain.

38:18.458 --> 38:19.500
"Pain". What is pain?

38:21.500 --> 38:22.875
It's a rhetorical question.

38:22.875 --> 38:25.000
Pain is being judged by the
color
of your skin,

38:25.792 --> 38:29.333
pain is not being allowed to
have
a relationship with someone

38:29.333 --> 38:31.000
because they are the wrong
gender.
Am I right?

38:32.291 --> 38:34.083
You go, girl. [laughs]

38:34.417 --> 38:37.083
Pain is being fisted by
a 300-pound rich white guy

38:37.083 --> 38:38.875
because you haven't got enough
money
to pay the rent.

38:39.458 --> 38:39.625
What pain is not...

38:40.792 --> 38:42.625
is labor.

38:43.125 --> 38:44.375
-Sweet.
-Right.

38:44.667 --> 38:45.583
-[John] Wait.
-Okay.

38:46.709 --> 38:48.125
[Amy] Excuse me. Can I be
of some assistance to you?

38:48.125 --> 38:50.583
-Don't start without me.
-What are you doing here?

38:51.166 --> 38:53.208
I have every right to be here.
I'm the father of Alex's baby.

38:53.208 --> 38:55.291
I should be part of the process.

38:56.500 --> 38:57.709
You looked at my planner.

38:58.834 --> 39:00.000
Okay, okay, relax.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.750
You never seen a poly-amorous
relationship before?

39:02.750 --> 39:04.458
-No.
-Yeah. well simmer down.

39:06.166 --> 39:06.834
Welcome, John.

39:07.208 --> 39:09.000
-You are welcome, one and all.
-Yeah, sorry.

39:09.500 --> 39:13.583
Amy, can I just say that we're
not wha--

39:13.583 --> 39:14.834
-what you just said we are.
-Yes.

39:14.834 --> 39:18.875
But, John is the real father
and he's very much welcome.

39:19.875 --> 39:23.041
-Thanks, Alex.
-Is he your sperm donor, too?

39:23.041 --> 39:24.375
Allison, that is enough
judgement.

39:25.041 --> 39:27.083
They're lesbians. They don't
wanna talk
about sperms.

39:27.083 --> 39:28.458
Right-O! Sorry.

39:29.959 --> 39:32.000
I'd like you to take your
partner's hand,
and put it on the baby's head.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.250
Now, if you're seven months or
under,
that's gonna be up here,

39:35.250 --> 39:37.166
under your breastal balcony.

39:37.625 --> 39:41.250
And if you're further along,
it might be down in your minge.

39:41.250 --> 39:42.875
Right. I don't-- What am I
supposed to do?

39:42.875 --> 39:44.125
-I don't have a partner.
-[Amy] Oh, I want a part of
this.

39:44.792 --> 39:47.917
-I'll be your partner.
-Well, she's my partner, so.

39:47.917 --> 39:49.375
[Amy] I'd like to be your
partner.
Where are you? You up or down?

39:49.375 --> 39:52.250
-I'm up. Yup.
-Here. Right.

39:52.875 --> 39:54.500
-And if you put your hand on my
hand...
-Okay.

39:54.792 --> 39:58.750
...feeling that lovely little
bonce there.
That feels nice, right?

39:58.750 --> 39:59.917
Yup.

40:00.375 --> 40:01.750
Loving that.

40:03.542 --> 40:06.750
-Olivia, wait.
-Nice breathing today, Alex.

40:06.750 --> 40:09.208
-Yeah. Cheers, John.
-You're looking great, too.

40:10.083 --> 40:13.208
Body's really acknowledging
the pregnancy. It's beautiful.

40:13.208 --> 40:17.667
Olivia, wait. Look, he's
harmless.
Like you said he has the right.

40:17.667 --> 40:21.208
I was wrong. He deserves no
rights.
He deserves impotency.

40:21.709 --> 40:24.417
You have my word.
This is as close as John will
get.

40:24.709 --> 40:28.583
John? Not Skeletor-Mr. String
Theory-
Fuck-face-Leaning Tower of Piss?

40:29.375 --> 40:31.959
No? Or The Man Evolution Forgot?

40:32.750 --> 40:34.750
-Just John.
-Just John? Okay.

40:35.333 --> 40:36.834
Got it. Just so now, thanks.

40:37.709 --> 40:38.542
[sighs]

40:42.500 --> 40:42.583
[sighs]

40:47.792 --> 40:50.875
Oh, I did have a couple of
questions...
concerns.

40:50.875 --> 40:52.709
Fine.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.417
Extremely burnt toast.
Can't get enough of the stuff.
Healthy?

40:56.750 --> 40:57.667
Perfectly normal to have
cravings.

40:57.959 --> 41:01.709
-Also--
-I have tons of energy. Is that
normal?

41:02.875 --> 41:05.583
Perhaps, it's 'cause you haven't
been sober this long since you
were 12.

41:06.458 --> 41:06.583
Hey, hormones.

41:08.458 --> 41:09.542
Oh, sorry.

41:10.250 --> 41:12.125
It's just that your...

41:13.125 --> 41:16.959
spring-has-sprung pregnancy
is fucking annoying.

41:17.250 --> 41:18.333
Language.

41:19.291 --> 41:20.375
What?

41:20.792 --> 41:21.792
I don't know,

41:22.083 --> 41:23.125
Amy said something about...

41:23.542 --> 41:25.625
baby feeling the meaning
of everything that it hears.

41:25.625 --> 41:25.875
Is that right, Dr. Parks?

41:26.458 --> 41:29.291
Just medical questions, please.

41:29.625 --> 41:34.792
I'm not, uh, singing at
crystals or waving
my arms about dancing in a
field.

41:35.041 --> 41:37.166
Also, nose bleeds.
I've had millions of them.

41:37.667 --> 41:40.959
In court, debating a case, no
idea
I looked like the final scene
of Carrie.

41:40.959 --> 41:43.500
The increase in blood supply
puts more pressure on the
vessels,

41:43.500 --> 41:46.792
causing them to... easily erupt.

41:47.834 --> 41:48.959
[sighs]

41:48.959 --> 41:51.583
-You still don't want to know?
-No, no thank you.

41:51.583 --> 41:54.083
I guess we don't get many
surprises
in life anymore,

41:54.083 --> 41:56.458
-so I thought, why find out.
-How fascinating.

41:58.291 --> 42:00.333
-You ready?
-Yes, yes. Let's find out.

42:00.333 --> 42:00.959
-You will be having...
-Yep.

42:01.417 --> 42:03.583
...a little baby...

42:05.000 --> 42:05.875
-boy.
-[sighs]

42:06.458 --> 42:09.291
-Aw.
-[chuckles]

42:09.959 --> 42:12.041
Baby boy.

42:13.500 --> 42:16.667
-I have a penis inside of me.
-First time for everything.
Hey! Hey!

42:24.000 --> 42:25.041
Okay.

42:26.583 --> 42:29.041
[high pitched] That's something
I wanted to feel, I wanted to
feel the...

42:29.041 --> 42:31.166
[indistinct chatter]

42:46.792 --> 42:47.667
Hello, Charles.

42:52.625 --> 42:54.041
-What's wrong with your face?
-Oh!

42:54.667 --> 42:59.333
-Ah! Pigmentation thingamajig.
-Yes. Yeah.

42:59.667 --> 43:01.667
Same thing happened to my wife
when she was pregnant.

43:02.709 --> 43:06.083
Yes. Turns out I've got every
possible pregnancy ailment
going.

43:06.458 --> 43:08.125
I'm actually terribly depressed.

43:10.500 --> 43:14.583
My wife picked up some fake tan,
smothered it all over her face.

43:14.583 --> 43:15.667
Evened it out.

43:16.750 --> 43:18.250
That's actually not a bad idea.

43:18.750 --> 43:20.959
She looked like
an entirely different person.

43:20.959 --> 43:24.125
-Hmm.
-Like I was having a naughty
affair.

43:24.125 --> 43:25.208
[sniffs]

43:29.417 --> 43:30.959
I just pissed myself, Charles.

43:32.875 --> 43:33.709
Again.

43:43.500 --> 43:44.792
I've missed this.
Just hanging out with someone.

43:46.333 --> 43:48.250
What? Your wife?

43:48.959 --> 43:51.000
I thought you hated her guts.

43:51.625 --> 43:52.917
Actually, she hated mine.

43:54.709 --> 43:54.792
Oh!

43:56.291 --> 43:56.959
-Sorry.
-Yeah.

44:00.083 --> 44:04.083
I guess I just had to make a
decision
between being a pioneer and a
husband.

44:04.959 --> 44:05.792
Huh?

44:06.917 --> 44:09.709
-I'm sure Steve Jobs had the
same problem.
-[sighs]

44:11.625 --> 44:12.792
Or maybe, I wasn't the perfect
husband.

44:13.625 --> 44:15.959
And what's the perfect husband?

44:16.792 --> 44:19.000
Uh, not a total dick?

44:19.792 --> 44:19.917
That's better.

44:21.625 --> 44:23.917
"Be worthy love and love will
come."

44:25.959 --> 44:26.750
Wait.

44:28.417 --> 44:29.792
Are you quoting my favorite
book?

44:30.166 --> 44:32.000
Little Women  .
Yeah, you were absolutely right.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.834
I read it cover to cover and I
cried!

44:35.875 --> 44:37.959
Good! And who am I? Joe?

44:41.250 --> 44:41.875
You can be whoever you wanna be.

44:45.667 --> 44:48.083
You are lovely underneath it
all.

44:50.625 --> 44:53.291
-You're lovely everywhere.
-Huh?

44:53.291 --> 44:54.417
So, how're you feeling, anyway?

44:55.792 --> 44:56.875
The bump gets in the way of
everything.
Even shaving my legs.

44:57.959 --> 45:00.959
Uh, I need to pee. But it's a
phantom pee.

45:01.417 --> 45:04.834
I go to pee. No pee comes out.
You know, like when you're on
drugs.

45:04.834 --> 45:07.125
-What about the constipation?
-You what?

45:07.792 --> 45:10.291
Haven't you got nuts bowels?
I have.

45:10.625 --> 45:13.667
I hate to break it to you,
John, but you're not pregnant.

45:13.667 --> 45:16.875
I have couvade syndrome.
Sympathy pains for the partner.

45:16.875 --> 45:17.542
-Of course you have, darling.
-I do.

45:17.542 --> 45:19.500
[laughs] Yeah, right.

45:19.500 --> 45:20.583
[door slams]

45:21.375 --> 45:23.250
John was just going.

45:24.667 --> 45:26.583
Was he brushing your hair?

45:27.041 --> 45:29.792
It's getting so thick and I
just needed
someone to brush it out for me.

45:31.375 --> 45:35.083
-Mine's not getting any thicker.
-The ones on your chin are.
Boom!

45:35.542 --> 45:37.709
[laughs]

45:37.709 --> 45:41.000
I'm sorry. Sorry! I'm
constipated.

45:43.375 --> 45:45.625
-Fake tan.
-Yeah.

45:46.208 --> 45:47.417
Yeah.

45:47.417 --> 45:49.917
For my blotchy and apparently
hairy face.

45:53.417 --> 45:57.500
-Why? Why? Why the fuck is he
here?
-Shh.

45:59.792 --> 46:02.667
I'm sorry. Did I swear?
Oh, I'm sorry.

46:03.208 --> 46:05.875
You know I'll fall for you.
But you know what else is
really awful?

46:06.375 --> 46:08.750
[breathes deeply]

46:10.417 --> 46:13.458
Trying to get Mr. Chapman
convicted
of tax evasion whilst you
repeatedly fart

46:13.458 --> 46:20.166
throughout your closing
statement.
Mr. Chapman is roaring with
laughter.

46:21.750 --> 46:21.875
What do I do?

46:23.625 --> 46:24.709
Nothing.

46:25.291 --> 46:26.917
Just keep on farting.

46:27.834 --> 46:31.041
All I want is to come home for
a snuggle
with my girlfriend.

46:31.417 --> 46:33.333
-But she's--
-Oh!

46:34.250 --> 46:36.583
-Oh!
-Oh, God! I'm sorry.

46:36.959 --> 46:38.875
-What did I do?
-I think it kicked.

46:39.959 --> 46:42.709
[chuckles] Oh!

46:43.333 --> 46:45.000
Oh! Oh!

46:45.834 --> 46:46.875
-Can I feel?
-Yep.

46:47.208 --> 46:48.583
-There?
-I can't feel anything.

46:48.583 --> 46:49.709
Wait, wait, wait.

46:51.792 --> 46:53.125
-Still can't--
-Just wait.

46:55.750 --> 46:57.291
-I missed it kick.
-No, shh.

46:57.583 --> 46:58.333
-Babe. No, babe.
-I can't believe.

46:59.083 --> 47:02.125
-I missed the baby kicking.
-No. Shush, shush.

47:02.625 --> 47:05.166
-I'm sorry, I'm so useless.
-Babe, this is gonna have to
stop.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.125
-The baby kicked.
-Aw.

47:11.125 --> 47:13.083
-Felt like wind.
-Perhaps, it was wind?

47:14.500 --> 47:15.750
It's entirely possible.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.125
-[toilet flushes]
-We're going out.

47:19.625 --> 47:22.250
-Do you want me to go?
-Uh, finish your food.

47:24.500 --> 47:25.625
It was nice.

47:27.834 --> 47:31.709
Aw! Bugger me! These boobs, man.

47:32.667 --> 47:35.041
[sighs] They're so big and
tender.

47:35.041 --> 47:36.458
-[Olivia] We ready?
-[Alex] Yep.

47:37.792 --> 47:39.792
-What's wrong?
-Boobs. They kill.

47:39.792 --> 47:42.125
Aw. Poor darling.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
-Yeah.
-Oh!

47:44.333 --> 47:45.166
-[Olivia] Yeah?
-[Alex] That's nice.

47:45.166 --> 47:46.834
-[Olivia] Yeah?
-[Alex] Mm-hmm.

47:46.834 --> 47:48.625
[Alex] Oh, yeah. Mm.

47:49.166 --> 47:52.041
Oh, that's better.
[sighs] Bye, John.

47:54.834 --> 47:54.959
[door opens]

48:00.041 --> 48:00.083
[door shuts]

48:06.083 --> 48:07.417
[Amy]
So, you're in your safe space

48:07.417 --> 48:11.750
and you can feel the warm water
lapping against your ankles.

48:11.750 --> 48:14.208
-[Amy] And your digestive
system...
-Alex, I need to show you
something.

48:14.208 --> 48:16.750
-[Alex] What?
-My-- My penis.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.709
-Yeah, I'm set. Thanks.
-Wait, wait.

48:19.709 --> 48:20.625
Please, it'll take two minutes.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.750
Your membranes give away.
You're dealing with the-- Hi,
guys!

48:23.750 --> 48:26.458
-[Allison] Hello. How're you?
All right?
-[Amy] Hi, Olivia.

48:28.583 --> 48:32.250
[chuckles] Yeah, you're a tiny
bit late,
Allison.

48:32.667 --> 48:34.208
I'm really worried. Be a friend.

48:34.208 --> 48:36.667
-[Amy] You can feel yourself
moving...
-C'mon!

48:36.667 --> 48:39.333
-I did my 96er on you.
-I don't wanna remember
anything, okay?

48:39.750 --> 48:41.291
All my best moves wasted on a
lezza.

48:42.792 --> 48:44.792
-[Amy] Throughout history...
-All right, two minutes. C'mon.

48:45.250 --> 48:49.834
...give birth. You feel your
vagina
give way.

48:50.250 --> 48:52.583
You can feel that baby weighing
down
on your perineum.

48:53.291 --> 48:56.250
And the urge to shit it out
is now overwhelming you.

49:00.834 --> 49:03.083
-It's orange.
-Am I gonna die?

49:03.750 --> 49:08.041
So, we're gonna do some
exercises now
to stretch the internal
abdominal muscles.

49:08.041 --> 49:10.917
But it's quite absorbing.
I don't really want to be
interrupted.

49:10.917 --> 49:16.417
-Do you know where your
"people" are?
-Oh, yes, yes. Sorry. I'll just
check.

49:19.291 --> 49:20.417
[Amy] Leave that there.

49:24.125 --> 49:25.458
[Alex] And how does that feel?
Does it feel good?

49:26.125 --> 49:28.166
[John] Oh, it's definitely
swollen.

49:28.792 --> 49:30.959
[indistinct conversation]

49:30.959 --> 49:32.583
[yelps]

49:32.583 --> 49:35.166
-Oh!
-Oh, God! No, no, no.

49:35.166 --> 49:38.291
-Oh.
-Now, it's John's John.

49:40.291 --> 49:41.875
-Just look at it, babe.
-What?

49:42.750 --> 49:44.458
Can cancer be orange?

49:47.500 --> 49:49.333
Oh!

49:51.625 --> 49:52.667
Oh!

50:03.709 --> 50:05.208
Is that fake tan?

50:07.417 --> 50:08.625
Oh!

50:08.625 --> 50:09.834
-[door latch rattles]
-[Amy] Sorry to interrupt.

50:10.667 --> 50:13.917
I've gotta say, you guys, I am
starting
to wonder whether this...

50:15.083 --> 50:19.667
arrangement situation...
life choice thing is altogether
healthy.

50:19.667 --> 50:22.583
Amy... so sorry. Please ignore
us.

50:22.583 --> 50:27.500
I promise you. We are all
perfectly normal
and healthy.

50:30.625 --> 50:32.917
-Is it bleeding? Am I bleeding?
-You are.

50:35.500 --> 50:36.583
Take that and get out.

50:37.583 --> 50:38.709
[Amy] Please.

50:39.333 --> 50:41.583
Yeah, all of you. Thanks.

50:49.417 --> 50:50.250
Olivia.

50:50.917 --> 50:51.959
Yes?

50:52.709 --> 50:53.166
I'll make this up to you. I
promise.

50:55.250 --> 50:57.333
Just don't masturbate in our
house again.

50:58.250 --> 50:59.166
-That's all I ask.
-Yep.

51:01.041 --> 51:02.834
I most definitely probably
won't.

51:12.417 --> 51:15.208
["Before I Fall To Pieces"
playing]

51:23.000 --> 51:25.375
Surprise!
I bought you a yoga teacher.

51:27.041 --> 51:29.417
-Just for an hour.
-Or two.

51:29.417 --> 51:30.250
Maybe.

51:30.875 --> 51:31.959
Cheers, John.

51:51.750 --> 51:55.375
-[crunching]
-[exhaling deeply]

51:58.917 --> 52:00.583
[laughing]

52:10.291 --> 52:10.417
[Olivia snores]

52:20.834 --> 52:22.709
[door opens]

52:23.625 --> 52:24.458
[John] Alex!

52:31.125 --> 52:31.458
Cheers, John.

53:30.166 --> 53:32.333
[Ben] Well, it's jolly nice to
meet you.

53:32.667 --> 53:35.542
-I love Alex like a sister.
-Have you ever been with a man?

53:36.208 --> 53:38.166
[scoffs] Why'd you ask that?

53:38.166 --> 53:42.000
I just thought it might run in
the family.
I had a small bet with myself,
actually.

53:42.375 --> 53:45.333
Oh, right. I see.
Well, I take it one of you lost?

53:45.959 --> 53:47.834
Jury's still out.

53:51.625 --> 53:53.333
It was Alex's idea. Get mad at
her.

53:53.709 --> 53:55.583
She wants you to spend more time
with her bestie.

53:56.166 --> 53:57.834
She did not call you her bestie.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.417
Isn't pregnancy making her
nicer?

54:01.792 --> 54:03.875
Did you call John your bestie?

54:04.375 --> 54:06.792
Huh? I can't hear you. Talk to
John.

54:09.625 --> 54:13.750
I do hope, Olivia and he'll get
on today.
He's a sweet guy underneath.

54:14.375 --> 54:16.166
Underneath what? His trousers?

54:16.709 --> 54:20.750
-Michael, really?
-No. That's cool. It is kinda
confusing.

54:20.750 --> 54:26.875
-Oh, is it? So, you're confused?
-No, I mean, to the outside.

54:27.917 --> 54:32.208
Someone once said that, sexual
orientation
goes beyond the act of sex and--

54:32.583 --> 54:36.166
Well, I think that makes sense
for what happened with me and
John.

54:36.166 --> 54:39.583
So you're--
You're really straight
underneath.

54:39.583 --> 54:44.333
No, I'm gay. I just did
something that
wasn't necessarily about my
sexuality.

54:45.041 --> 54:47.417
Do you mind if I use that excuse
sometime, love?

54:48.250 --> 54:50.792
My friends say I'm like a gay
man
trapped in a woman's body.

54:51.917 --> 54:54.583
We should go shopping sometime.
We'd have a right laugh.

54:54.917 --> 54:58.625
Yes, I'm sure we would have a
laugh,
but not 'cause I'm gay. I'm
straight.

54:58.625 --> 55:00.583
Oh, yeah. I'm not making any
insinuation,

55:00.583 --> 55:02.291
I'm just saying if you did
happen
to be gay.

55:02.917 --> 55:05.959
And you are short of a diva.
I do know all the moves to
"Vogue."

55:05.959 --> 55:09.166
-I have a wife. And kids.
-And a bit of a lisp.

55:10.625 --> 55:11.458
I'm just saying.

55:12.709 --> 55:13.792
So, did we bond?

55:15.166 --> 55:17.500
You're not going to go that
angry puce
shade whenever I'm needed?

55:17.500 --> 55:20.625
Aw, says the man with the tango
penis.

55:22.959 --> 55:24.458
You've done enough. Thanks.

55:25.625 --> 55:28.500
-What do you mean?
-Maybe, you need to give Alex
some space.

55:30.458 --> 55:31.583
Is that what Alex wants?

55:33.166 --> 55:34.250
Yeah.

55:35.458 --> 55:37.792
I think she's being kind
because she thinks you're
lonely.

55:38.125 --> 55:39.500
-She said that?
-Yeah.

55:42.166 --> 55:44.458
Why am I asking you, I'll ask
her.
Hey, Al. [grunts]

55:48.000 --> 55:49.500
-[John yells]
-[Olivia] Oh, no.

55:50.500 --> 55:52.959
-What was that for?
-It was an accident.

55:52.959 --> 55:54.083
-[grunts]
-Oh, no.

55:54.750 --> 55:57.625
God, poor chap. He's soaked.

55:58.959 --> 56:00.083
Does that turn you on?

56:13.667 --> 56:17.834
Hello, you two. Where did you
come from?

56:18.500 --> 56:18.667
Where's your mommy?

56:21.000 --> 56:22.959
Where's your mum--
What?

56:24.375 --> 56:25.959
Would you like some chocolate?

56:27.750 --> 56:29.917
Now since you're both so
sweet...

56:32.166 --> 56:33.500
I'm going to give one to you...

56:34.917 --> 56:38.667
and one to you. There you go!
Is that nice?

56:39.333 --> 56:41.875
[kids laughing]

56:45.500 --> 56:48.709
Okay. Um, you both stop. Stop
it.

56:49.625 --> 56:50.875
Um, do you want to put that--
Put the cucumber back.

56:51.208 --> 56:53.083
[Olivia stammers]

56:53.875 --> 56:57.208
-Could you stop that? Do you
want--
-[kids shouting]

56:57.208 --> 57:00.166
Maybe just-- I don't-- I don't
know.
Where's your mum--

57:00.166 --> 57:01.625
-Okay, stop that.
-[Lily] Sam!

57:01.625 --> 57:02.625
Stop that!

57:02.625 --> 57:04.583
-[Lily stammering]
-[children yelling]

57:04.917 --> 57:07.834
-[children yelling]
-[Lily] Pick this up.

57:08.083 --> 57:12.041
What? I know! I'm a terrible
mother.
You-- Oh, my God!

57:13.208 --> 57:16.083
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-[children laughing]

57:16.583 --> 57:21.750
I just-- I gave him some
chocolate
and then he, um, but then I ran
out.

57:21.750 --> 57:23.458
God! He's gonna be up for days.
Fuck!

57:23.875 --> 57:26.709
Okay, she's squashing the mush--
stamping on the mushrooms there.

57:26.709 --> 57:29.667
Right. I'll pay for this. Don't
worry.
So sorry.

57:29.667 --> 57:34.250
-My fault. Um, they're lovely.
-What're you having?

57:35.458 --> 57:39.667
Hope it's a girl. Because girls
never turn psycho and shoot up
schools.

57:40.542 --> 57:42.291
And you know little boys,
they pee on your face...

57:42.625 --> 57:45.125
every time you change their
nappy.

57:45.458 --> 57:48.542
And we've demonized any kind
of light spanking

57:48.542 --> 57:50.250
so that playing card's off the
table.

57:51.458 --> 57:53.625
You know, I thought some-- The
last month
of pregnancy,

57:53.625 --> 57:56.125
when my pelvis was splitting
open,

57:56.125 --> 57:59.750
and I was hobbling around on
crutches.
It was hell. But um...

58:00.291 --> 58:02.250
But then I had Sam.

58:03.166 --> 58:04.625
-[children giggling]
-I'm having a boy.

58:06.291 --> 58:07.750
-Bugger.
-Thank you.

58:09.458 --> 58:12.875
-Well. At least, you're young.
-I'm 40.

58:13.291 --> 58:14.667
[inhales deeply] I'd say I'm
sorry,
but, um...

58:16.500 --> 58:18.083
you've actually made me feel
less alone.

58:20.917 --> 58:22.750
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

58:25.291 --> 58:25.792
I used to be pretty like you.

58:27.166 --> 58:28.917
Great. Okay.

58:29.709 --> 58:31.583
-Good luck.
-C'mon, Sam!

58:32.667 --> 58:34.917
C'mon, darling, let's get your
brother.
Sam!

58:37.375 --> 58:38.500
[yelling] Sam!

58:41.417 --> 58:43.458
["You and I" playing]

59:09.417 --> 59:11.875
-You into sports?
-Yes!

59:11.875 --> 59:12.834
-Great!
-Chess!

59:20.625 --> 59:21.667
I know why I'm here.

59:23.250 --> 59:27.083
Oh, um, yes.
Olivia thought we might get on.

59:27.375 --> 59:28.709
And she wants to stop me trying
to steal her girlfriend.

59:30.333 --> 59:34.333
-That's it exactly, actually,
yeah.
-I'm even throwing her a baby
shower.

59:34.333 --> 59:36.375
Maybe you should throw yourself
a cold shower.

59:36.375 --> 59:37.458
[laughing]

59:39.625 --> 59:42.417
How about we ease this situation
by getting hammered?

59:43.041 --> 59:44.875
-Fuck, yes.
-[chuckles]

59:49.917 --> 59:51.875
[crowd cheering]

59:57.125 --> 59:58.959
[screams]

59:59.458 --> 01:00:02.333
Alex, they need boundaries
or they will destroy everything.

01:00:02.333 --> 01:00:04.917
-They're just a couple of kids.
-Okay, so don't-- Please. Sorry.

01:00:07.417 --> 01:00:11.417
Should we-- should we just agree
to disagree about the whole...

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:12.917
-Parenting bit?
-[chuckles]

01:00:14.333 --> 01:00:15.667
We've got plenty of time.

01:00:16.333 --> 01:00:19.583
We'll be fine.
Besides, we're not gonna be
alone.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:20.917
We've got John.

01:00:32.792 --> 01:00:34.875
-God, you're sexy.
-Yeah.

01:00:34.875 --> 01:00:37.417
No wonder you turned a gay
woman straight.

01:00:40.208 --> 01:00:42.792
I wonder if my wife's being gay
somewhere.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.125
-Hey! What's up, man?
-She left me.

01:00:53.625 --> 01:00:55.208
Age-- ages ago.

01:00:55.959 --> 01:01:00.959
No reason. Just that I dry her
entire
being up like a prune.

01:01:00.959 --> 01:01:06.792
No! They just do it to annoy
you.
Ha-ha! We're in our little
girly club,

01:01:06.792 --> 01:01:10.792
and you can't join because
of your stupid penis.

01:01:14.291 --> 01:01:16.500
Well, my penis is not stupid.

01:01:16.834 --> 01:01:21.333
I used to pound her steak just
the way
she liked it till it was extra
thin.

01:01:21.667 --> 01:01:22.000
And in return she...

01:01:24.041 --> 01:01:25.959
pounded my heart till it
disappeared.

01:01:27.375 --> 01:01:29.625
My penis is not stupid.

01:01:38.083 --> 01:01:41.500
-Oh, God. Sorry, sorry.
-It's okay.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.083
-Hang on!
-Okay.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.291
Okay, okay.

01:01:46.291 --> 01:01:47.417
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:01:47.417 --> 01:01:49.166
-What happened? Oh, gosh!
-Oh, gosh!

01:01:49.709 --> 01:01:52.750
All right. Let's just--
Let's just leave it, babe.

01:01:53.625 --> 01:01:55.083
I need to go for a piss, okay?

01:01:55.083 --> 01:01:55.917
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:01:56.834 --> 01:01:56.917
[sighs]

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:18.500
-[indistinct chatter]
-[laughing]

01:02:26.333 --> 01:02:28.458
Isn't it a bit late in the day
for a shower?

01:02:28.875 --> 01:02:31.125
The baby waiters had
a month's waiting list.

01:02:31.542 --> 01:02:33.875
I know this
because the shower planner told
me.

01:02:34.166 --> 01:02:35.083
I shit you not. The shower
planner.

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:41.834
-[groans]
-Are you about to be sick?

01:02:41.834 --> 01:02:43.667
I literally haven't slept in
three days,

01:02:43.667 --> 01:02:45.834
so I don't know
if I'm gonna puke or pass out.

01:02:46.667 --> 01:02:47.917
-[grunts]
-I'd go for the former.

01:02:47.917 --> 01:02:50.458
-These floors look pretty solid.
-Got it!

01:02:56.917 --> 01:03:00.625
Well, hello.
[chuckles] Fancy finding you
here.

01:03:03.291 --> 01:03:07.250
No! No, this isn't-- We're not--
I'm just standing here.

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:10.625
I meant Alex's baby shower.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.917
-The girl you love like a
sister.
-Yes. Yeah, I know. I just--

01:03:16.709 --> 01:03:18.333
I was just making conversation.

01:03:22.625 --> 01:03:27.125
-Oh, my gosh! You're pregnant,
too. Aw.
-Oh, my gosh!

01:03:28.625 --> 01:03:30.000
How did you guess?

01:03:30.583 --> 01:03:32.875
You've got a little bit of sick
in your hair.

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:33.875
I know.

01:03:34.417 --> 01:03:35.625
-I know. I put it in there.
-Oh!

01:03:35.625 --> 01:03:37.583
'Cause it's good for the
natural protein
fiber oils.

01:03:37.583 --> 01:03:39.458
-[Carol] Oh!
-Yeah.

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:41.917
John and Alex have such
fascinating friends.

01:03:41.917 --> 01:03:43.333
-[both chuckle]
-What did you call them?

01:03:43.625 --> 01:03:44.625
John and Alex.

01:03:45.125 --> 01:03:46.959
It's not John and Alex. It is
John...

01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:49.125
and...

01:03:54.041 --> 01:03:55.959
-Alex.
-That's what I said.

01:03:56.208 --> 01:03:58.000
-John and Alex--
-No, you didn't.

01:03:58.375 --> 01:03:59.000
'Cause you're saying it
like they're together,

01:04:00.667 --> 01:04:02.583
putting them in a sentence
together.
They don't belong in a sentence
together.

01:04:02.834 --> 01:04:03.917
I'm sorry.

01:04:03.917 --> 01:04:04.834
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry, who are you?

01:04:04.834 --> 01:04:06.959
-Olivia! I'm Olivia.
-Ah! Yeah.

01:04:09.709 --> 01:04:10.834
Olivia and Alex.

01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:14.792
-Al and Ol?
-We're just so used to...

01:04:15.667 --> 01:04:17.166
-John and Alex. [chuckles]
-Yeah.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
-Who are you?
-Uh, Luke Hammond.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.709
-Oh!
-CEO of Mannism. Hail to the
Alpha.

01:04:26.125 --> 01:04:27.041
[chuckles]

01:04:29.458 --> 01:04:31.834
I'm gonna need to pop back in
for another puke.

01:04:32.166 --> 01:04:33.792
-Sure.
-[door hinges creak]

01:04:34.667 --> 01:04:36.792
-Mother.
-There you go.

01:04:37.667 --> 01:04:38.750
Right.

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:44.709
Condoms. A massive box of
condoms.

01:04:45.041 --> 01:04:48.041
Well, I never make the same
mistake twice.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.542
I make it five or six times
just to be sure...

01:04:50.542 --> 01:04:52.375
[laughing]

01:04:53.375 --> 01:04:54.417
Moving on.

01:04:55.542 --> 01:04:56.458
[John] All right, let's have
another
family present.

01:04:57.208 --> 01:04:59.583
-Here's mine.
-Thank you, John-O.

01:05:00.041 --> 01:05:02.542
Oh!

01:05:02.542 --> 01:05:03.625
Oh!

01:05:06.208 --> 01:05:07.208
[sighs] John.

01:05:08.333 --> 01:05:09.875
[John] It's a first edition.

01:05:11.709 --> 01:05:16.375
I know that our baby is going
to open my eyes to the world,

01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:20.417
in as many varied and wonderful
ways
as you have.

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:22.500
[all] Aw.

01:05:23.709 --> 01:05:26.583
-Thanks.
-To John and Alex.

01:05:27.291 --> 01:05:30.959
-[all] To John and Alex.
-Thank you from both of us.

01:05:31.458 --> 01:05:33.125
-It's very kind.
-Sorry, John?

01:05:34.875 --> 01:05:37.125
-What was that?
-It's very kind of everyone.

01:05:37.125 --> 01:05:37.250
No, before.

01:05:38.333 --> 01:05:40.959
-What you said before?
-Thank you from both of us.

01:05:41.417 --> 01:05:43.542
Since when do you speak on
Alex's behalf?

01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:45.875
-Uh, okay, Olivia.
-[Olivia] Huh?

01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:49.417
I just asked a question.
It's a very simple question.

01:05:49.417 --> 01:05:53.709
I just wanna know,
when I am conversing with my
girlfriend,

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:57.208
-if I should be addressing you?
-[clears throat]

01:05:58.083 --> 01:06:00.583
Hello! I'm still here. Remember
me?

01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:04.750
You enjoying your fetus shaped
cookies?

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:07.959
-Just calm down, will ya?
-Oh, calm down. [laughs]

01:06:07.959 --> 01:06:09.125
No, John. No.

01:06:11.625 --> 01:06:13.875
You don't tell me to calm down.

01:06:13.875 --> 01:06:17.500
-Easy.
-Shut. The fuck. Up!

01:06:17.792 --> 01:06:18.959
[Alex] Babe?

01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:22.458
-Not now, babe.
-If not now, then when? When?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.625
Can I tell this mindless human
being
to back off?

01:06:28.959 --> 01:06:30.083
[John chuckles]

01:06:30.917 --> 01:06:33.709
How about when we realize that
our child

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.291
is being raised on the
misogynistic values
of Mannism?

01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:44.208
Or, what about when we-- Mm-hmm.
When I have to buy a bigger
house

01:06:44.625 --> 01:06:46.709
because John wants to move in.

01:06:47.333 --> 01:06:50.000
Um, we should let him because
he's lonely
and divorced.

01:06:50.834 --> 01:06:56.375
-And after all, he's the real
father.
-Stop it, Olivia. He's trying.

01:06:56.792 --> 01:06:59.750
Am I just supposed to forget
that he's the one you cheated
with.

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:01.375
C'mon! She didn't.

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:05.667
What is this? Alex?

01:07:06.208 --> 01:07:09.458
You're gay. But then you're
straight.
Then you're gay again.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.709
Oh, and apparently, you're
pregnant woman
of the year!

01:07:12.792 --> 01:07:14.083
I'm ti-- I just can't keep up.

01:07:14.333 --> 01:07:19.500
I really can't.
At some point, you have to
choose.

01:07:20.083 --> 01:07:21.917
No, I don't.

01:07:22.834 --> 01:07:25.166
You are supposed to love all of
it.

01:07:27.792 --> 01:07:29.375
I'm sorry I don't fit
into your tight knit plans.

01:07:31.417 --> 01:07:33.709
Those plans were always about
you.

01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:37.709
All I ever wanted was to give
you
a proper family.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.750
Yeah. The perfect family, yeah?
Like Ben's?

01:07:42.417 --> 01:07:44.667
Ben, who is getting divorced.

01:07:48.583 --> 01:07:50.417
What?

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:53.417
Hello. Yes.

01:07:54.291 --> 01:07:55.333
I'm the one with a failed
marriage.

01:07:55.333 --> 01:07:59.458
-Glad everyone's been made
aware.
-Shocker.

01:08:00.458 --> 01:08:02.583
Everyone's got their shit,
Olivia, right?

01:08:04.166 --> 01:08:06.291
-Alex, what is it?
-I think you should leave,
Olivia.

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:08.583
-She doesn't have to leave.
-Okay, so I misjudged that.

01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:12.709
-Oh! I think I'm having a
contraction.
-Okay, it's fine. She's too
early.

01:08:12.709 --> 01:08:15.041
-She's not having a contraction.
-I'm sure it's a contraction.

01:08:15.041 --> 01:08:16.582
-[grunts]
-It's not gonna be a
contraction.

01:08:16.582 --> 01:08:18.959
-Fuck!
-We could, of course, be wrong.

01:08:21.959 --> 01:08:23.082
Doctor Parks.

01:08:24.417 --> 01:08:25.457
Oh hey, doc. We got a lot of
snot
coming out of this one's hoo-ha.

01:08:26.291 --> 01:08:28.082
I wanted to be a concert
pianist.

01:08:29.082 --> 01:08:30.750
All right. We'll get the nurse
to set you up.

01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:31.834
-Who's coming?
-I am.

01:08:31.834 --> 01:08:34.250
-Right take that!
-Yep, yep. All right, be
careful.

01:08:35.125 --> 01:08:35.207
Oh!

01:08:38.417 --> 01:08:40.041
Okay, I'll just-- I'll be here.

01:08:44.332 --> 01:08:45.207
[both chuckle]

01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:46.875
[Paul] Right then.

01:08:51.959 --> 01:08:53.000
Oh!

01:08:54.207 --> 01:08:57.457
Baby's very low down in your
pelvis.
Which is good.

01:08:57.750 --> 01:08:59.457
I'm just gonna have a little
listen.

01:09:08.125 --> 01:09:09.291
[Paul] I can't find...

01:09:13.709 --> 01:09:15.542
Well, let me just get Doctor
Parks.

01:09:16.625 --> 01:09:19.291
It's all fine. It's going to be
fine.

01:09:20.125 --> 01:09:22.041
-Just let him out there know,
okay?
-Okay.

01:09:22.041 --> 01:09:23.291
-You all right?
-Mm-hmm.

01:09:23.291 --> 01:09:23.457
-You sure?
-Mm-hmm.

01:09:26.959 --> 01:09:28.457
[sighs deeply]

01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:31.082
-[Olivia] John.
-What's happening?

01:09:31.082 --> 01:09:33.332
We don't know.
They've gone to get the doctor.

01:09:33.332 --> 01:09:34.332
Why, what's wrong?

01:09:34.917 --> 01:09:36.375
-Should I speak to someone?
-I think...

01:09:36.375 --> 01:09:38.166
it was trouble finding the
heartbeat
but it's already quite far down.

01:09:38.667 --> 01:09:42.125
-There's contractions, so--
-So, you wouldn't be able to
find it.

01:09:42.125 --> 01:09:42.332
-Right.
-Okay.

01:09:45.166 --> 01:09:46.250
She will be fine.

01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:47.457
Yeah.

01:09:48.667 --> 01:09:51.375
Um, okay.

01:09:56.166 --> 01:09:58.458
-[Dr. Parks] Miss Jones?
-Hi.

01:10:18.041 --> 01:10:19.083
Oh!

01:10:52.041 --> 01:10:52.417
I'm so sorry.

01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:57.583
There's no heartbeat. I'm so
sorry.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.417
What? Wait, wait.

01:11:04.417 --> 01:11:08.417
-Are you sure? Could you try it
again?
-No heartbeat was detected. I'm
certain.

01:11:08.834 --> 01:11:11.875
How are you certain?
Maybe, you made a mistake.

01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:14.583
Most--

01:11:15.917 --> 01:11:18.583
Most commonly, an infection has
occurred.
We'll do further tests.

01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:21.917
I know this is hard.

01:11:22.917 --> 01:11:24.917
But I'm afraid we have to think
of Miss Jones' safety.

01:11:25.417 --> 01:11:28.750
Now, and the safest step now
is to deliver this baby.

01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:35.083
Plea-- Please could you-- could
you just
do it one more time for us?

01:11:35.083 --> 01:11:35.542
Just one more time again.

01:11:36.041 --> 01:11:38.041
I'm so sorry.

01:11:39.291 --> 01:11:39.417
She's gone.

01:11:41.291 --> 01:11:42.375
She?

01:11:45.083 --> 01:11:46.291
Could you give us a minute?

01:12:15.208 --> 01:12:16.625
-[Alex] Babe?
-[Olivia] Yes, I'm here.

01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:19.500
I don't want you here.
[panting]

01:12:20.625 --> 01:12:23.000
I don't want this in anyone's
memory.
I just want to get it done.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.375
[grunting]

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:27.625
-Are you sure?
-Please.

01:12:57.542 --> 01:13:02.542
[John] "Seldom, except in books,
do the dying utter memorable
words,

01:13:03.417 --> 01:13:06.709
see visions, or depart
with beatified countenances...

01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:11.500
and those who have sped
many parting souls know

01:13:11.917 --> 01:13:17.750
that to most the end comes
as naturally and simply as
sleep.

01:13:19.291 --> 01:13:22.500
As Beth had hoped,
the tide went out easily...

01:13:26.125 --> 01:13:28.333
and in the dark hour before the
dawn...

01:13:29.417 --> 01:13:31.959
on the bosom where she
had drawn her first breath...

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.250
she quietly drew her last.

01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:39.375
With no farewell but one loving
look...

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:41.667
one little sigh."

01:15:18.166 --> 01:15:21.208
Look, I know you're probably
gonna wanna talk about it...

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.083
about her.

01:15:25.792 --> 01:15:26.875
But you see, I can't.

01:15:28.458 --> 01:15:29.875
I don't know if I'll ever be
able to.

01:15:33.625 --> 01:15:34.625
I was so looking forward
to being something.

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:38.583
Anything.

01:15:42.458 --> 01:15:43.667
[glass bottles rattle]

01:15:43.667 --> 01:15:45.709
-Is John okay?
-Uh...

01:15:48.417 --> 01:15:49.542
When he cries...

01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:52.750
his entire body crumples up
like a little old lady's.

01:15:55.542 --> 01:15:55.667
That's funny.

01:15:57.250 --> 01:15:59.500
-It's not.
-No.

01:16:02.792 --> 01:16:04.750
I actually saw him this morning.

01:16:06.375 --> 01:16:08.625
I can't help waddling...

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:12.709
about, reminding him-- Sorry.

01:16:14.208 --> 01:16:17.083
Maybe, it's best if you keep
your distance from him a bit.

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.834
Right. Okay.

01:16:24.166 --> 01:16:24.709
We could go to my parents', I
suppose.

01:16:27.125 --> 01:16:28.458
Or you can go if you want.

01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:31.834
[Sue] Darling!

01:16:32.583 --> 01:16:34.583
-We're going to have such fun.
-[Olivia] Oh!

01:16:34.583 --> 01:16:37.917
Daddy's birthday party's coming
up.
I've invited that Biggles
Tilsbury.

01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:42.583
-I've got such a girl crush on
her.
-You can just say crush, Mummy.

01:16:43.542 --> 01:16:46.834
-Anyway, I shouldn't be here
for long.
-You can stay here as long as
you like.

01:16:46.834 --> 01:16:48.000
We really are fine.

01:16:49.625 --> 01:16:52.166
I think it's time you started
thinking
about this baby other than that
girl.

01:16:52.166 --> 01:16:53.959
Don't you?

01:16:58.375 --> 01:17:02.041
[indistinct chatter]

01:17:16.041 --> 01:17:17.125
Hello!

01:17:18.458 --> 01:17:23.125
Oh, look. John's sporting a man
bun,
the final tosser frontier.

01:17:23.417 --> 01:17:24.709
He's a handsome devil.

01:17:25.875 --> 01:17:25.959
Sorry, darling.

01:17:27.625 --> 01:17:32.166
Oh, look! Biggles Tilsbury just
got here.
You two would make a lovely
couple.

01:17:32.625 --> 01:17:34.917
Thanks, Mummy. I still have a
girlfriend.

01:17:36.959 --> 01:17:41.542
-[Alfie chuckling]
-Where's Magda and the girls
then?

01:17:42.583 --> 01:17:46.458
Oh, um, she took the kids
on a weekend away.

01:17:46.458 --> 01:17:49.417
Isn't that a bit odd, going on
holiday
without your husband?

01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:53.917
-Um...
-Not at all, actually. No, um...

01:17:54.375 --> 01:17:57.667
-Trudy leaves Sting behind all
the time.
-Does she now?

01:17:58.333 --> 01:18:00.041
-Bully for her.
-Hmm.

01:18:00.542 --> 01:18:01.458
[mouths]

01:18:02.458 --> 01:18:06.667
This is organic Hereford
blackcurrant vodka.

01:18:06.667 --> 01:18:07.792
[pops bottles open]

01:18:09.083 --> 01:18:11.750
And this is the coolest old
person party
I have ever seen.

01:18:13.709 --> 01:18:13.834
I better not.

01:18:15.166 --> 01:18:19.625
Alex, an international playboy
once said,
"To drink is to live".

01:18:20.375 --> 01:18:23.417
And that international playboy
was me!

01:18:23.709 --> 01:18:24.000
[laughing]

01:18:26.667 --> 01:18:27.834
Yeah, Alex. What you got to
lose?

01:18:30.875 --> 01:18:31.000
Just one shot.

01:18:34.375 --> 01:18:36.458
-Hmm.
-[indistinct chatter]

01:18:37.375 --> 01:18:39.208
-[Olivia] Very nice to see you.
-Whatto!

01:18:39.208 --> 01:18:41.208
Oh! Sorry.

01:18:41.792 --> 01:18:46.208
-Biggles, how are you? Very
long time.
-Very long time, yeah.

01:18:46.208 --> 01:18:49.875
The last thing I remember was
running
around your garden naked.

01:18:50.166 --> 01:18:51.500
-Oh!
-[laughs]

01:18:51.917 --> 01:18:54.709
-So, last week then?
-No, no. We were five.

01:18:55.125 --> 01:18:56.208
Yes, no. I was joking.

01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:01.583
Oh, right. Yeah, I know,
'cause wouldn't have been last
week.

01:19:01.583 --> 01:19:03.333
-No.
-Wouldn't have been naked.

01:19:04.458 --> 01:19:06.166
Aren't you a bit old to be
having a baby?

01:19:07.166 --> 01:19:10.834
-Uh, I guess not.
-Ah! Well, I do hope it's
normal.

01:19:12.375 --> 01:19:14.208
Thank you.

01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:17.083
Most kind. Ben.

01:19:18.375 --> 01:19:21.291
Come over. Biggles, do you
remember Ben?
This is my brother.

01:19:21.583 --> 01:19:25.917
-Uh, vaguely.
-You babysat me through
childhood.

01:19:25.917 --> 01:19:28.834
-Oh!
-We went to the same school

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:30.625
and then university.

01:19:31.667 --> 01:19:33.083
Ben? Whose wife is a rampant
shagger?

01:19:36.041 --> 01:19:37.500
Yep. That Ben.

01:19:38.417 --> 01:19:40.250
You used to wet the bed, didn't
you?

01:19:42.250 --> 01:19:44.583
[laughing]

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.291
-[John] Get up!
-[Alfie screams]

01:19:46.792 --> 01:19:49.917
[John screaming]

01:19:59.542 --> 01:20:01.125
[John and Alfie screaming]

01:20:05.291 --> 01:20:08.542
[soft song playing]

01:20:22.291 --> 01:20:24.166
Hi!

01:20:24.667 --> 01:20:25.792
Alex.

01:20:28.125 --> 01:20:28.417
Hey.

01:20:29.125 --> 01:20:31.250
You weren't just going to
leave, were you?

01:20:31.542 --> 01:20:34.208
No. I just needed a moment away
from it all.

01:20:35.291 --> 01:20:36.208
You've been drinking.

01:20:37.834 --> 01:20:41.166
-Yeah! I'm allowed now,
remember?
-I know. I--

01:20:43.458 --> 01:20:45.458
I wasn't saying...

01:20:52.458 --> 01:20:54.041
-Did you not get the invite?
-Yeah. I'm...

01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:57.667
stood right here.
[chuckles]

01:20:57.667 --> 01:21:00.250
Well, what part of "garden chic"
do hot pants fit under?

01:21:01.333 --> 01:21:04.625
I don't know. Is there
a I-don't-give-a-fuck option?

01:21:04.625 --> 01:21:05.750
Yeah, okay.

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:08.500
[sighs]

01:21:09.291 --> 01:21:12.375
Alex, can we try and get back
to normal?
Please?

01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:17.417
Maybe, less of the swearing,
smoking,
boozing?

01:21:18.792 --> 01:21:20.750
More of the early nights, yoga?

01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:27.333
So, I can be a good mum
to my non-existent child, is
that it?

01:21:27.792 --> 01:21:31.500
No. So you can be a good mother
to mine.
For ours.

01:21:34.417 --> 01:21:38.041
-I need more time.
-We don't have any more time,
Alex.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:41.208
Please.

01:21:43.542 --> 01:21:45.417
We need you.

01:21:48.875 --> 01:21:53.083
I can't be everything you want
me
to be right now. I'm so sorry.

01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:05.417
This feels like something has
broken.

01:22:05.917 --> 01:22:07.500
-It's just changed.
-No.

01:22:10.583 --> 01:22:15.083
I shouldn't feel so lost when
I'm where
I always wanted to be.

01:22:15.917 --> 01:22:16.208
[Sue] Olivia!

01:22:21.250 --> 01:22:22.083
Should I go?

01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:28.208
Olivia?

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:33.083
[sighing]

01:22:46.542 --> 01:22:48.917
[door opens]

01:22:53.625 --> 01:22:54.709
Wow!

01:22:59.375 --> 01:23:01.792
-Has she even seen this?
-No.

01:23:08.959 --> 01:23:10.750
Why is it yellow? She's having
a boy.

01:23:12.333 --> 01:23:13.625
And what if it was a boy that
wanted
to be a girl, Jonathan?

01:23:13.625 --> 01:23:15.500
Yeah, all right.

01:23:16.959 --> 01:23:18.500
All right. I'm a middle class,
straight,
white guy and I suck, sorry.

01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:26.000
To teach is to learn yourself.
It's a noble and inspiring
profession.

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:27.500
Good.

01:23:27.959 --> 01:23:30.291
-And Miss Jones?
-What?

01:23:34.625 --> 01:23:35.709
Um...

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.291
I guess if I'm a teacher
then I won't be some wired
artist,

01:23:40.291 --> 01:23:41.208
desperate for her next joint.

01:23:42.959 --> 01:23:45.208
I'll be normal. Be part of the
race.

01:23:46.917 --> 01:23:48.333
That sounds quite nice, now.

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:54.625
And yeah, what she said.

01:23:58.291 --> 01:23:59.291
[doorbell ringing]

01:24:02.834 --> 01:24:05.458
-Whatto.
-Hello, Biggles.

01:24:05.709 --> 01:24:09.208
Bought the backgammon. Bit of
competition
should help get that baby out.

01:24:09.542 --> 01:24:11.000
Oh, yay!

01:24:12.041 --> 01:24:16.875
-John, what on earth are you
doing here?
-Hold the door. I have to talk
to you.

01:24:17.917 --> 01:24:20.542
-Who's this?
-Biggles Tilsbury. How do you
do?

01:24:21.959 --> 01:24:23.250
That is such a stupid name.

01:24:23.250 --> 01:24:26.750
No offence. You should be a dog
in a handbag, in like, 2001.

01:24:27.792 --> 01:24:29.500
-Goodbye, John.
-I have to talk to you.

01:24:29.875 --> 01:24:31.417
-We're busy.
-It's Alex.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.333
-What's wrong with Alex?
-Do you like my bun?

01:24:38.542 --> 01:24:41.291
-I don't have time for this,
John.
-No. But, yet, you never have
time.

01:24:41.583 --> 01:24:44.333
I've lost the love of my life,
I'm 40 and I live with my
parents

01:24:44.333 --> 01:24:46.542
and I'm about to shit out
another human being.

01:24:46.542 --> 01:24:49.250
[wailing]

01:24:50.875 --> 01:24:54.542
Have you got a point in this
conversation?

01:24:54.542 --> 01:24:55.000
Or in life?

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.250
Boo-fucking-hoo!

01:24:59.750 --> 01:25:02.083
You know what you may not know,
Olivia?

01:25:03.375 --> 01:25:05.083
I was born with scoliosis.

01:25:06.166 --> 01:25:06.834
[clicks tongue] I had a back
brace

01:25:07.417 --> 01:25:10.000
right through school
to straighten things out.

01:25:10.417 --> 01:25:11.166
-Okay.
-I know.

01:25:11.792 --> 01:25:16.125
You're thinking, "But how he's
so tall
and Greek-God like?

01:25:16.125 --> 01:25:18.375
Well, that was not the case
back then.
I was twisted like a pretzel.

01:25:19.959 --> 01:25:24.333
The other boys used to hang me
by my brace from the football
goal net

01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:26.959
and then kick balls at my head.

01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:28.709
-Oh!
-Right at my head.

01:25:29.458 --> 01:25:31.792
-Gosh!
-Yup. And these were Scottish
boys, not...

01:25:32.917 --> 01:25:37.375
ya Harry Potter, posh, wee,
skinny things.
These are real proper men,

01:25:37.792 --> 01:25:40.125
kicking balls, right at my head.

01:25:41.792 --> 01:25:42.750
And then, they'd leave me there.

01:25:43.458 --> 01:25:46.917
All night, sometimes.
I just-- I'd swing about a bit.

01:25:47.625 --> 01:25:51.041
Come crashing down.
Mess up my back some more.

01:25:53.291 --> 01:25:54.417
-Sounds painful.
-Oh, yep.

01:25:56.625 --> 01:25:57.500
Oh, yeah. [sniffs]

01:25:59.667 --> 01:26:03.166
Then now... I'm the one causing
the pain.

01:26:04.417 --> 01:26:07.667
Breaking the ladies' heart.
Left, right, center, So...

01:26:09.291 --> 01:26:10.417
I can get anyone I want.

01:26:12.875 --> 01:26:13.917
You know who I couldn't get?

01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:16.834
Okay, well...

01:26:17.208 --> 01:26:19.625
Technically, you did get Alex,

01:26:19.625 --> 01:26:21.542
so I don't know
if this little story is really
working.

01:26:22.125 --> 01:26:24.250
No, all I got Alex was blind
drunk.

01:26:26.125 --> 01:26:28.792
I've loved her since I first
saw her.

01:26:30.125 --> 01:26:33.166
Since she shouted at me for
directing
the Jehovah's witness' to your
door.

01:26:36.125 --> 01:26:37.500
To me, she was it.

01:26:40.208 --> 01:26:40.291
And it...

01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:43.375
loves only you.

01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:50.667
Alex is...

01:26:51.667 --> 01:26:55.625
100% bona fide carpet muncher...

01:26:58.667 --> 01:26:59.542
and your carpet...

01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:01.583
is the only one...

01:27:03.208 --> 01:27:03.333
she wants to munch.

01:27:05.625 --> 01:27:07.959
That was very sweet for about a
second.

01:27:09.125 --> 01:27:11.208
You know, she redecorated
the spare room...

01:27:12.208 --> 01:27:12.417
for the baby.

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:18.000
I didn't know that.

01:27:20.834 --> 01:27:21.917
[sighs]

01:27:29.125 --> 01:27:32.542
-I was just so scared.
-I know you were. I was too.

01:27:36.041 --> 01:27:37.417
I really wanted to be a dad.

01:27:44.208 --> 01:27:45.542
Could you settle for uncle?

01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:54.083
-C'mon.
-John, wait.

01:27:54.083 --> 01:27:57.792
Wait, John. John, John, John,
John, John.
I'm not just--

01:27:57.792 --> 01:27:58.542
John, please. I can feel your
beard.

01:28:00.834 --> 01:28:04.208
-Darling, where you're going?
-I'm going home.

01:28:05.083 --> 01:28:05.750
-Are you trying to run?
-Yeah.

01:28:06.417 --> 01:28:09.625
-[Olivia] That is the general
idea.
-Why?

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.625
It just feels like a...
running kind of moment.

01:28:13.917 --> 01:28:16.792
She's going to get the love of
her,
and my life.

01:28:16.792 --> 01:28:17.834
-[Sue] Really?
-Sounds complicated.

01:28:18.583 --> 01:28:22.208
That tummy rather kills romance
doesn't it, darling?

01:28:22.208 --> 01:28:23.709
Ah! Yes.

01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:26.792
It does. It does.

01:28:27.792 --> 01:28:28.625
Thank you, Mummy.

01:28:29.792 --> 01:28:32.291
-Cup of tea before you go?
-I mean, we probably have time.

01:28:32.291 --> 01:28:33.375
John!

01:28:39.125 --> 01:28:40.250
[door shuts]

01:28:41.375 --> 01:28:44.000
[panting]

01:28:48.125 --> 01:28:50.333
It is a toe ring but I'm gonna
get you
a proper ring.

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:51.500
Alex...

01:28:52.458 --> 01:28:53.709
I want to marry you.

01:28:54.792 --> 01:28:56.458
Because I do love it all.

01:28:57.083 --> 01:28:59.709
If you're a stoner,
or an artist or...

01:29:01.041 --> 01:29:03.750
a bloody astronaut. I don't
care.
You're you.

01:29:05.166 --> 01:29:09.500
You're so kind, and so great,
and just... Just...

01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:15.625
You're just a great person, Alex
and obviously,

01:29:15.625 --> 01:29:17.000
by the way, you're so much
better
than an astronaut.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.959
And-- But actually, you're
better
than anyone I can think of,

01:29:19.959 --> 01:29:24.417
so I'm going to stop waffling
and beg you. Alex...

01:29:25.917 --> 01:29:26.458
please be with me forever.

01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:39.125
-"You're better than an
astronaut?"
-[chuckles]

01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:43.125
I'm still not that great
at proposing or...

01:29:44.792 --> 01:29:48.291
-to be fair, that great at any
of it.
-I don't think either of us are.

01:29:56.291 --> 01:29:58.709
-What?
-I think I've just burst.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.083
[sighs]

01:30:02.041 --> 01:30:03.583
-[screams] John!
-He's in the car.

01:30:04.834 --> 01:30:06.000
'Course, he is.

01:30:06.333 --> 01:30:08.709
-Go slow, go slow, go slow.
-Breathe.

01:30:30.417 --> 01:30:30.542
I'll just be here.

01:30:33.166 --> 01:30:33.542
You don't have to come.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.834
I know.

01:30:42.375 --> 01:30:47.583
Right, Miss Miller, let's prove
geriatrics
can still have kids, okay?

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.417
-[laughs] That's my joke.
-[heavy breathing]

01:30:50.417 --> 01:30:54.500
Right. I do not want to be down
here
for too long so c'mon now, push!

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:56.125
[Olivia yelling]

01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:10.834
[baby crying]

01:31:17.125 --> 01:31:21.959
[indistinct chatter]

01:31:29.959 --> 01:31:34.792
-Cake, you two?
-We've already had a ton of
cake.

01:31:35.291 --> 01:31:37.000
[Olivia] Right.
This one is without the hash.

01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:39.542
[giggles]

01:31:41.291 --> 01:31:42.250
Cake?

01:31:42.834 --> 01:31:45.250
-No, thank you.
-Beats the office, eh, Charles?

01:31:45.625 --> 01:31:48.417
-Too bloody hot in here.
-Or not.

01:31:49.917 --> 01:31:53.125
Ben, will you please have some
of our mother's cake?

01:31:53.125 --> 01:31:56.417
I actually think masculinity
is overrated, personally. Thank
you.

01:31:56.417 --> 01:31:57.458
Thank you.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.959
Hello, my sweet boy.

01:32:01.375 --> 01:32:03.000
Upsy-daisy.

01:32:06.041 --> 01:32:07.709
[Olivia] Some days, I'm a good
mother.

01:32:09.041 --> 01:32:11.542
Some days, I'm a bit of a crap
one.

01:32:11.542 --> 01:32:12.834
["Bitch" playing]

01:32:28.125 --> 01:32:30.000
[John] How was your first
Christmas, eh?

01:32:30.667 --> 01:32:31.750
[Olivia] Alex and I never did
get married.

01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:38.166
After everything that had
happened,
it didn't seem important.

01:32:39.125 --> 01:32:41.291
It's no longer about all those
labels.

01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:45.834
I'm simply about you, me and
him.

01:35:51.583 --> 01:35:53.875
Your mammalian roots...

01:35:54.208 --> 01:35:56.500
okay? Just have some respect
for those.

01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:57.458
Has anyone ever seen
an elephant give birth?

01:35:58.125 --> 01:36:01.959
No? Oh, you have to see that,
that's amazing.

01:36:01.959 --> 01:36:04.083
Has anyone seen a chimpanzee
give birth?

01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:07.250
No? Has anyone seen, like, a
family pet?

01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:09.333
-Or...
-Yeah.

01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:11.208
Uh, gerbil.

01:36:11.667 --> 01:36:13.667
John?
Seriously, John?

01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:15.291
This is part of the problem.
We are so disconnected

01:36:15.709 --> 01:36:18.583
from our natural history.

01:36:18.583 --> 01:36:21.583
That we believe that birth is
not for us
but you know everybody,

01:36:22.291 --> 01:36:23.875
everybody eats, everybody
shits...

01:36:25.250 --> 01:36:27.667
[laughing]

01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:30.750
-What was that for?
-It was an accident.

01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:30.959
-[screams]
-Oh, no.

01:36:32.625 --> 01:36:37.417
Oh, no. The baby. The baby. The
baby.
The baby. The baby. The baby.
The baby.

01:36:37.417 --> 01:36:40.959
The baby. The baby. The baby.
The baby.
No! No!

01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:44.291
Bit of a handful, I'd imagine.

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:49.000
-Would you consider divorce
or...
-[clears throat] Um...

01:36:50.333 --> 01:36:52.875
Yeah,
probably don't wanna talk about
it...

01:36:53.125 --> 01:36:55.041
like here... with you...

01:36:55.041 --> 01:36:57.875
One of those open
relationships, is it?

01:36:57.875 --> 01:36:58.959
[sighing]

01:37:00.250 --> 01:37:03.041
-So nice to catch up.
-It really is. What a-- What a
treat.

01:37:03.333 --> 01:37:05.333
To see you and it--
Just you...

01:37:06.083 --> 01:37:07.166
Um, just--

01:37:07.166 --> 01:37:08.417
I think I've got a ladybird in
my ear.

01:37:08.792 --> 01:37:11.625
-That's it. Um. Um, yeah, yeah.
-Oh!

01:37:11.625 --> 01:37:13.667
-[woman] Cut!
-Sorry.

01:37:15.291 --> 01:37:19.417
I actively hope that baby's not
mine.
I will punch you right in the
boob.

01:37:21.333 --> 01:37:22.709
You make me sick.

01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:29.000
[laughs] Please say cut!

01:37:30.125 --> 01:37:31.500
[muffled scream]

01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:32.125
[Alex] Look, babe!

01:37:34.083 --> 01:37:36.166
[exhaling heavily]

01:37:36.583 --> 01:37:38.625
[Alex] Look!

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.709
[hysterically laughing]

01:37:47.417 --> 01:37:48.792
I'm sorry to interrupt.

01:37:50.166 --> 01:37:54.333
What's happening? I want a part
of this.
This looks like fun.
