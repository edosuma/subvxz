02:09.963 --> 02:11.965
Brittany.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.066
Brittany?

02:13.201 --> 02:14.468
Go away.

02:16.204 --> 02:19.507
Billy, go away!
I'm not here! Go away!

02:25.112 --> 02:26.547
Brittany, open the fucking door.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.349
- I can't talk to you.
- Come on.

02:28.416 --> 02:29.850
I can't talk to you.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.319
Just talk to me for a minute.

02:36.224 --> 02:37.491
What the fuck are you doing?

02:37.558 --> 02:38.826
Huh?

02:38.892 --> 02:39.960
You need to leave.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.429
What do you mean,
I need to leave?

02:41.495 --> 02:43.631
You look me in the fucking
eye right now.

02:43.697 --> 02:46.334
God damn you, look me
in the fucking eye.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.236
What did you expect me
to do, Billy?

02:48.269 --> 02:49.937
I don't have a fucking choice.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.239
What do I expect you to do?

02:51.272 --> 02:53.106
I expect you
to be my fucking friend!

02:53.241 --> 02:54.475
You were never my friend!

02:54.542 --> 02:56.143
Really? You got
a short memory, honey!

02:56.244 --> 02:58.479
- Billy!
- You got a really
short fucking memory!

02:58.546 --> 02:59.813
The only reason you hired me

02:59.880 --> 03:01.849
is because I fuck
guys for a living

03:01.915 --> 03:04.285
and you thought that
I'd be handy for you!

03:04.352 --> 03:05.786
That was it!

03:05.853 --> 03:07.020
And you were right

03:07.087 --> 03:08.656
because you're fucking smart!

03:08.722 --> 03:10.624
Because I did it!

03:10.691 --> 03:13.494
I fucked that cop
because you asked me to.

03:13.561 --> 03:14.762
I asked you to do that?

03:14.828 --> 03:16.697
I asked you to find
some shit out for me.

03:16.764 --> 03:18.265
- Okay?
- You asked me to do it.

03:18.266 --> 03:19.467
How much did Callie offer you?

03:19.533 --> 03:20.734
After you watched the video,

03:20.801 --> 03:22.379
you looked at me with
so much fucking shame!

03:22.403 --> 03:23.671
What did Callie... Really?

03:23.737 --> 03:25.373
I never felt like more
of a fucking whore

03:25.439 --> 03:26.640
in my entire life!

03:26.707 --> 03:29.277
I told you I was sorry
about this shit, okay?

03:30.544 --> 03:31.979
What did she offer you?

03:32.045 --> 03:33.280
What did Callie offer you?

03:33.281 --> 03:34.391
She didn't offer me anything.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.525
Really?
She offered you nothing?

03:35.549 --> 03:36.717
This is my only chance...

03:36.784 --> 03:38.395
You're selling me down
the fucking river...

03:38.419 --> 03:40.287
...to not go to fucking
prison for ten years.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.155
I'm supposed to sit
in there and fucking rot

03:42.290 --> 03:43.824
while you go and do
your fucking case?

03:43.891 --> 03:45.593
That's the only thing
you care about!

03:45.659 --> 03:47.219
You don't give a shit
about anyone else!

03:47.295 --> 03:48.805
People have been killed.
Do you know that?

03:48.829 --> 03:50.989
I know that, yeah.
Well, you didn't
save fucking Rachel!

03:51.031 --> 03:52.666
What are you going to do for me?

03:57.471 --> 04:00.040
You're too fucking fancy
for this place!

04:00.107 --> 04:01.775
Get the fuck out of here!

04:05.513 --> 04:07.615
Okay, you sleep well, okay?

04:09.717 --> 04:12.353
I came here to try, all right?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.562
Oh, fuck.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.909
Finally. Are we set?

04:35.976 --> 04:38.712
We just came from a meeting
with the management committee.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.615
There's no way
you can get in that
witness chair, Donald.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.183
I have been summoned.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.452
We can get you out of that.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.219
You are part
of the defense team.

04:46.354 --> 04:47.788
Anything you would say
is shielded

04:47.855 --> 04:48.855
by both privilege

04:48.889 --> 04:49.923
and work product.

04:49.990 --> 04:50.990
That was once true.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.660
It is no longer so.

04:52.726 --> 04:55.563
After Wendell Corey
chose to invoke my name

04:55.629 --> 04:57.197
during his testimony,

04:57.264 --> 04:59.366
legally he waived the privilege

04:59.367 --> 05:02.369
by raising a reliance
on counsel defense.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.705
You know this plays
right into Billy's hands.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.674
He has no case right now.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.276
By you taking the stand,
you risk giving him one.

05:09.377 --> 05:11.379
The fact that his case
rests on me...

05:11.445 --> 05:12.513
what more could we want?

05:12.580 --> 05:13.947
This isn't about you.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.616
It isn't about your ego

05:15.683 --> 05:18.185
or your intelligence
or your Billy grudge.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.553
This is about you

05:19.620 --> 05:21.389
doing what is best
for the client.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.023
Ohh.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.002
And you can't use that
damn thing in court.

05:26.026 --> 05:30.063
Are you saying they might
see me as a monster?

05:30.130 --> 05:31.198
You're damn right.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.933
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Letts.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.870
I have been summoned.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.407
I will comply
with the court order,

05:40.408 --> 05:43.411
and I will discharge
my civic duty.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.414
Donald.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.416
Did you puppeteer this?

05:49.417 --> 05:50.551
You told Wendell

05:50.618 --> 05:51.885
to hide behind privilege,

05:51.952 --> 05:53.887
knowing full well
that they would ask you

05:53.954 --> 05:55.022
to the stand.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.626
This is the big day.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.728
We don't want to be late.

06:00.794 --> 06:04.432
The risk you are putting us
through is enormous.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.600
I need to get to court.

06:28.956 --> 06:32.993
What a sight you all are for me.

06:34.462 --> 06:37.465
You may find my appearance odd.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.933
Remember, I am in no pain.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.675
You are my people.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.579
I'm your people.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.551
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth,

08:03.584 --> 08:04.584
so help you God?

08:04.618 --> 08:06.019
Yes, I do.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.589
I'm sorry. I didn't hear that.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.262
Yes, I do, I said.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.328
Hmm.

08:17.565 --> 08:19.066
Sir, in a nice loud voice,

08:19.132 --> 08:22.035
please introduce yourself
to the members of our jury.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.773
Donald Cooperman.

08:27.374 --> 08:28.909
And you're an attorney.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.043
Yes.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.311
A well-compensated,

08:31.378 --> 08:33.380
Yale-educated attorney.

08:33.446 --> 08:34.948
Not only Yale, but yes.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.284
You represent the defendant,
Borns Technology?

08:38.351 --> 08:39.852
Yes.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.255
As an experienced attorney,
you're familiar

08:42.322 --> 08:44.592
with something called the
advice of counsel defense.

08:44.658 --> 08:47.595
That's a legal doctrine
involving...

08:49.663 --> 08:52.365
good faith reliance

08:52.432 --> 08:56.169
on an attorney's, uh...

08:56.236 --> 08:57.504
advice.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.239
Let me pose a hypothetical.

08:59.306 --> 09:03.944
If someone like Borns Tech
were to detonate napalm bombs

09:04.011 --> 09:05.713
off the coast of Long Beach,

09:05.779 --> 09:07.579
which is just a few miles
from this courtroom,

09:07.615 --> 09:10.483
that defense could come in
pretty handy, couldn't it?

09:10.618 --> 09:12.920
I don't agree with your premise.

09:12.986 --> 09:16.056
A clever attorney
could invoke that defense

09:16.123 --> 09:19.259
to help his client
avoid responsibility.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.393
It's a...

09:20.460 --> 09:21.629
it's... it's... it's...

09:21.695 --> 09:24.965
it's a legitimate
legal defense...

09:25.032 --> 09:27.334
honored in courts
across the land.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.769
Ever advise Borns Tech

09:28.836 --> 09:30.537
about testing cluster bombs
in the ocean?

09:30.638 --> 09:32.940
I did not.

09:33.006 --> 09:35.175
- Wendell Corey says you did.
- That's not what he said

09:35.242 --> 09:37.244
on the closed circuit
television replay I saw,

09:37.310 --> 09:41.214
but if he did say that
in some other venue,

09:41.281 --> 09:42.683
I would say he was mistaken.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.485
Did you advise
or instruct Ryan Larson

09:45.552 --> 09:46.854
or anyone else at Borns Tech

09:46.920 --> 09:48.555
to design or test cluster bombs?

09:48.656 --> 09:50.724
No. I did not.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.694
Did a man named Karl Stoltz
ever authorize Ryan Larson

09:53.761 --> 09:55.896
to test cluster bombs?

09:55.963 --> 09:59.867
Uh, I've never heard of anyone
by the name of Karl Stoltz.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.002
Are you familiar with
the original plaintiff

10:02.069 --> 10:04.171
in this lawsuit...
Rachel Kennedy?

10:04.237 --> 10:05.806
Only from the pleadings.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.607
Hmm. She had to drop
out of the suit

10:07.675 --> 10:09.710
after she was run over
by a car and killed.

10:09.777 --> 10:12.646
Mm, yeah, I... I know...

10:12.713 --> 10:14.581
I know she had to drop out.

10:14.648 --> 10:15.916
Who's Lucy Kittridge?

10:15.983 --> 10:17.685
How is this remotely relevant?

10:17.751 --> 10:19.186
I was just getting to that.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.288
You and Miss Kittridge had
a personal relationship.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.656
Right?

10:22.723 --> 10:24.658
She worked for the firm.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.326
Are you aware of a conversation

10:26.393 --> 10:29.329
between Miss Kittridge
and a man named Karl Stoltz?

10:29.396 --> 10:30.764
Objection. Hearsay.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.599
Not offering
for the truth, Your Honor.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.668
Are you aware of a conversation?

10:34.735 --> 10:38.972
I don't know anyone
named Stoltz.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.140
Very well.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.609
Are you aware Mr. Stoltz
made threats on your life?

10:42.676 --> 10:44.678
Can we at least get
an offer of proof?

10:44.745 --> 10:46.413
- Where is this going?
- My offer of proof

10:46.479 --> 10:49.316
is that Mr. Stoltz made
threats against this witness,

10:49.382 --> 10:51.551
and then the next day
he wound up dead

10:51.618 --> 10:52.953
in the trunk of a car.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.721
What's the basis
of knowledge here?

10:55.823 --> 10:57.490
It was my car.

10:57.557 --> 10:59.927
There isn't a scrap of evidence

10:59.993 --> 11:03.296
tying our client to a murder.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.732
So if Lucy Kittridge...

11:04.765 --> 11:06.967
there she is
right here... Lucy...

11:07.034 --> 11:08.301
if she gets on the stand

11:08.368 --> 11:10.738
and testifies that you
know Karl Stoltz,

11:10.804 --> 11:12.605
- would she be lying?
- Objection.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.174
Calls for speculation.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.910
Well, Miss Kittridge is going
to be my next witness.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.379
I will take it to bene.
Go ahead.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.114
Miss Kittridge is going to say

11:21.181 --> 11:23.951
that Mr. Stoltz
had a conversation
with you.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.030
You know what I find, uh...

11:39.199 --> 11:41.068
unconscionable?

11:41.134 --> 11:42.803
Yes, please.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.208
A bottom-feeding vulture

11:48.275 --> 11:50.143
picking flesh
off the bones of the dead

11:50.210 --> 11:52.312
at the expense
of a great company,

11:52.379 --> 11:57.885
one that employs thousands
of Americans with good jobs,

11:57.951 --> 12:01.221
all the while protecting
American interests

12:01.288 --> 12:03.623
here and abroad.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.325
And making you
and Wendell Corey rich.

12:05.392 --> 12:08.862
We get paid well because
we do our work well.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.698
The beneficiaries of that work

12:11.799 --> 12:14.334
are not just Borns Tech.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.470
It's everyone.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.206
Even you.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.407
Me?

12:20.473 --> 12:22.275
Yeah. You, sir...

12:24.211 --> 12:25.512
I have...

12:27.815 --> 12:31.819
As a soldier, as a lawyer,
as a citizen,

12:31.852 --> 12:35.823
I have given my life
to this country's...

12:35.856 --> 12:38.125
this nation's fundamental
infrastructures,

12:38.191 --> 12:43.096
its systems of law and security.

12:43.163 --> 12:48.435
It's what allows little men
like you your day in court.

12:48.501 --> 12:49.501
It...

12:51.238 --> 12:53.340
Even when it means letting you

12:53.406 --> 12:55.308
try to commit fraud.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.510
Miss Kittridge
will take the stand

12:57.577 --> 13:01.114
and testify that you
damn well know Karl Stoltz.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.849
Is it still your testimony

13:02.850 --> 13:04.952
that you do not know
Karl Stoltz?

13:06.053 --> 13:07.554
I know what he is.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.624
I know what you are.

13:11.691 --> 13:12.860
This is your last chance

13:12.893 --> 13:14.361
to set the record straight, sir.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.037
I know...

13:28.175 --> 13:30.944
Mr. Cooperman, can you finish
answering the question?

13:35.348 --> 13:36.884
Mr. Cooperman.

13:39.686 --> 13:41.721
Can you answer the question?

13:41.788 --> 13:43.891
- Oh!
- Mr. Cooperman!

14:06.479 --> 14:08.115
Are those new glasses?

14:09.549 --> 14:11.618
Yeah.
Cute, right?

14:14.454 --> 14:15.622
- Hey.
- Billy.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.688
How's it going?

14:16.723 --> 14:18.025
So what's up?

14:18.091 --> 14:19.526
How's he doing?

14:19.592 --> 14:20.994
He had a stroke.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.529
There's some bleeding
on the brain.

14:22.595 --> 14:25.565
He's getting an MRI now
to determine how much.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.069
Was he sick or anything?

14:29.136 --> 14:30.803
Did he show any signs of it?

14:30.938 --> 14:32.081
Well, the doctor just told me

14:32.105 --> 14:34.041
that he had some sort
of a mini-stroke

14:34.107 --> 14:35.442
three months ago,

14:35.508 --> 14:37.510
so maybe that's why
he's been acting crazy.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.791
You know his testimony
now, it's not going to...

15:24.857 --> 15:26.159
Yeah, I know.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.628
I didn't get a chance to...

15:28.695 --> 15:29.695
Seriously.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.001
I didn't get a chance
to cross-examine him, so...

15:35.002 --> 15:36.436
No, I get it.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.151
I can't afford to let it go.

15:51.218 --> 15:53.120
I'm not going to let it go.

16:07.567 --> 16:10.603
Is there any question
as to what we should do?

16:10.670 --> 16:12.739
No. We should go forward.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.374
What?

16:14.441 --> 16:16.109
Well, we're winning, Wendell.

16:16.176 --> 16:19.879
They've put on
a thin case at best.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.581
We're in a good position.

16:21.648 --> 16:25.118
Cooperman actually
seemed sympathetic.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.054
Whoever thought
that was possible?

16:28.421 --> 16:29.522
Leonard?

16:31.124 --> 16:32.725
Your call, Wendell.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.062
M... Leonard,

16:35.095 --> 16:36.896
you've been telling me
to settle this

16:36.963 --> 16:38.065
from the start.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.099
We are winning.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.533
Let's just keep going

16:40.600 --> 16:42.702
and get this shit done already.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.072
He's right.

16:50.977 --> 16:53.113
Is he going to die?

16:53.180 --> 16:55.182
I don't know.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.551
So what happens now?

17:00.220 --> 17:02.122
I guess we'll see tomorrow.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.662
Do you think we should
go for a mistrial?

17:09.729 --> 17:12.332
Why would we do that?

17:12.398 --> 17:14.267
No, I'm... I'm worried

17:14.334 --> 17:16.903
that the stroke is going
to make him seem

17:16.969 --> 17:19.239
human somehow to the jury.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.511
Yeah, I get that.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.216
But the odds of me
getting any of that shit

17:29.282 --> 17:31.551
into evidence at a second trial

17:31.618 --> 17:32.852
are pretty bad.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.121
Yeah.

17:41.128 --> 17:43.430
God, think about
where we started,

17:44.931 --> 17:46.233
Really.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.136
It is pretty cool.

17:52.004 --> 17:53.373
Yeah.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.043
I guess it did seem
kind of impossible

17:57.144 --> 17:59.179
to be this far, didn't it?

18:07.254 --> 18:12.158
While I'm sure we all
wish Mr. Cooperman
a quick recovery,

18:12.159 --> 18:14.827
the case must
necessarily continue,

18:14.894 --> 18:17.029
which means we must proceed

18:17.164 --> 18:20.900
without Mr. Cooperman's
testimony.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.669
Mr. Cooperman's health issue

18:22.735 --> 18:24.971
means the defense was not
given the opportunity

18:25.037 --> 18:26.539
to cross-examine him.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.908
Not giving the defense
their right

18:28.975 --> 18:30.810
to confront
the witness against them

18:30.877 --> 18:32.412
is prohibited by law,

18:32.479 --> 18:35.982
unfair, and unduly prejudicial.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.484
You are therefore instructed

18:37.550 --> 18:42.021
to disregard all
of Mr. Cooperman's testimony.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.923
It is not part
of the trial record.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.225
It is not evidence.

18:45.292 --> 18:48.195
You may not consider it
in any way.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.430
Put it out of your minds.

18:50.497 --> 18:55.202
By law it did not happen.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.803
Is that clear?

18:59.239 --> 19:01.241
Okay.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.443
Mr. McBride.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.746
Anything else?

19:08.114 --> 19:09.782
No, Your Honor.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.385
Very well.

19:13.853 --> 19:14.921
Miss Senate.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.459
Your Honor, we call
Brittany Gold to the stand.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.290
Raise your right hand.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.559
Do you, Brittany Gold,
swear to tell the truth,

19:52.625 --> 19:54.327
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

19:54.394 --> 19:56.162
so help you God?

19:56.229 --> 19:59.466
You'll have to say it
for the record.

20:00.633 --> 20:01.634
Yes.

20:02.802 --> 20:03.802
Please.

20:14.847 --> 20:18.117
Ms. Gold, do you know
Mr. McBride?

20:18.184 --> 20:20.887
- Yes.
- How do you know him?

20:20.953 --> 20:23.122
Um, ahem,

20:23.189 --> 20:25.325
um, we...

20:25.392 --> 20:30.563
he was my attorney
in a criminal matter,

20:30.630 --> 20:34.667
and now he's...
he's my employer.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.304
Um, I...
I do paralegal work.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.606
On this case?

20:39.672 --> 20:41.708
Mm-hmm.

20:41.774 --> 20:44.010
Ms. Gold,

20:44.076 --> 20:46.479
did Mr. McBride ask you

20:46.546 --> 20:49.982
to blackmail anyone
involved in this case?

20:51.351 --> 20:53.653
A police officer.

20:53.720 --> 20:54.854
Um...

20:55.988 --> 20:57.624
Officer Sanders,

20:57.690 --> 21:02.194
the one who arrested
Mr. McBride for DUI.

21:02.329 --> 21:05.097
Bil... Uh, Mr. McBride

21:05.164 --> 21:09.168
asked me to sleep
with the officer

21:09.235 --> 21:12.171
to get information
on Karl Stoltz.

21:12.238 --> 21:17.209
What did you blackmail
the officer with, exactly?

21:17.344 --> 21:19.346
I made, um...

21:19.412 --> 21:21.681
a sex tape.

21:22.749 --> 21:25.518
Just me sleeping
with the officer,

21:25.585 --> 21:26.986
and...

21:28.555 --> 21:33.125
Mr. McBride used it
to blackmail the officer

21:33.192 --> 21:35.595
in order to give us more...

21:35.662 --> 21:38.798
into telling us
who Karl Stoltz was.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.571
No further questions,
Your Honor.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.586
Billy.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.529
Miss Gold,

22:10.630 --> 22:13.533
did the defense
offer you anything

22:13.600 --> 22:15.535
to testify against us?

22:17.604 --> 22:18.938
No.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.106
No?

22:22.241 --> 22:24.844
I've had some...

22:24.911 --> 22:27.780
recent legal problems,

22:27.847 --> 22:32.519
and they told me that they
would help me with...

22:32.585 --> 22:34.621
with those problems if I...

22:34.687 --> 22:37.790
if I came here
and I told the truth

22:37.857 --> 22:38.991
about what I knew.

22:39.058 --> 22:41.761
Miss Gold, did I ask you

22:41.828 --> 22:44.531
to have sex
with a police officer?

22:46.165 --> 22:47.199
You...

22:47.266 --> 22:48.868
Did I say

22:48.935 --> 22:51.538
"Hey, will you go have sex
with this police officer

22:51.604 --> 22:53.873
and make a tape?"
Did I say that?

22:53.940 --> 22:55.875
You told me...

22:55.942 --> 22:58.144
to do anything I had...

22:58.210 --> 22:59.512
anything I had to do

22:59.579 --> 23:01.447
to get information
about Karl Stoltz.

23:01.448 --> 23:03.349
The question is, did I ask you

23:03.450 --> 23:06.085
to have sex
with a police officer?

23:09.856 --> 23:10.790
No.

23:10.857 --> 23:13.025
Thank you.
No further questions.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.769
Redirect, Your Honor.

23:26.773 --> 23:28.575
Ms. Gold, have you
ever been charged

23:28.641 --> 23:29.842
with solicitation?

23:31.177 --> 23:33.480
Um, yes.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.482
And did Mr. McBride
represent you

23:35.515 --> 23:37.049
in these legal troubles?

23:38.485 --> 23:39.519
Yes.

23:39.586 --> 23:41.320
So it's your understanding

23:41.387 --> 23:43.489
that Mr. McBride was aware

23:43.490 --> 23:45.592
that you work as a prostitute.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.027
Yes.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.930
And when he asked you
to blackmail the officer,

23:50.997 --> 23:53.533
was your understanding
that he implied

23:53.600 --> 23:54.943
- that you would use...
- Objection.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.335
...your skills
as a prostitute...

23:56.402 --> 23:57.762
- Objection.
- ...to blackmail him?

24:00.507 --> 24:02.509
No further questions.

24:04.744 --> 24:07.179
You may step down, Miss Gold.

24:16.222 --> 24:17.857
The case is going very well.

24:17.924 --> 24:20.960
We're expecting a good result.

24:26.766 --> 24:27.600
What?

24:27.667 --> 24:28.901
I had a stroke.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.270
I had a stroke.

24:31.337 --> 24:32.338
Yes.

24:32.404 --> 24:34.173
- Yes.
- Yes, you had a stroke.

24:34.240 --> 24:37.777
It was scary, but the doctors
say you're on the mend.

24:44.551 --> 24:49.622
The partners will want to...

24:49.689 --> 24:51.557
replace me.

24:51.558 --> 24:52.625
Shh shh shh shh shh.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.193
Don't worry about that now.

24:54.260 --> 24:55.427
No.

24:55.562 --> 24:56.596
Donald.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.164
Don't worry about that now.

25:00.399 --> 25:02.101
I can't...

25:03.302 --> 25:05.572
I cannot live like this.

25:07.206 --> 25:10.276
I'm, uh...

25:10.342 --> 25:12.478
paralyzed.

25:12.579 --> 25:15.281
Hey. They say
it's only temporary.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.583
Ha ha.

25:18.585 --> 25:21.821
Don't lie to me.
I cannot live like this.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.898
Will you help me?

25:34.166 --> 25:35.668
What do you mean?

25:37.604 --> 25:41.007
You know...

25:41.073 --> 25:44.944
what they do to...

25:47.013 --> 25:48.748
the lead dog...

25:50.349 --> 25:52.619
of a sled team...

25:56.522 --> 25:58.958
when it's time to retire.

26:02.294 --> 26:04.263
Bullet in the brain.

26:11.203 --> 26:12.271
Mm.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.741
It's a kindness.

26:37.897 --> 26:40.132
Ryan Larson committed suicide.

26:41.668 --> 26:43.469
He said so himself

26:43.535 --> 26:46.538
in not one but two
suicide notes.

26:46.673 --> 26:48.875
His priest and his wife
thought so, too,

26:48.941 --> 26:51.010
until Mr. McBride showed up,

26:51.077 --> 26:53.713
trying to make money
off this tragedy.

26:54.814 --> 26:57.416
Mr. McBride
asks you to believe

26:57.483 --> 26:58.885
in a fantasy

26:58.951 --> 27:01.253
that Ryan Larson
was testing weapons

27:01.320 --> 27:03.355
and that Borns Tech blew him up,

27:03.422 --> 27:05.925
based on what evidence?

27:05.992 --> 27:12.531
A toy model buried
on the property by someone,

27:12.598 --> 27:15.101
the ramblings of a mentally ill,

27:15.167 --> 27:18.871
disgruntled ex-employee,
a porn revenge guy,

27:18.938 --> 27:23.943
the testimony
of a drug trafficker

27:24.010 --> 27:26.612
who showed you a video
of the boat blowing up,

27:26.713 --> 27:28.380
a fact that was
never in question.

27:28.447 --> 27:30.382
We all know the boat blew up.

27:30.449 --> 27:33.085
And finally, a prostitute

27:33.152 --> 27:34.987
who blackmailed a police officer

27:35.054 --> 27:38.190
with a sex tape
at Mr. McBride's behest.

27:39.859 --> 27:42.061
People sue deep pocket
corporations all the time,

27:42.128 --> 27:44.096
and for some attorneys
it's a business model...

27:44.163 --> 27:47.566
a hit and run, bleed and plead,
and eke out a settlement.

27:47.633 --> 27:49.902
And why not?
These corporations
have lots of money.

27:49.969 --> 27:51.370
What do they care?

27:51.437 --> 27:54.240
But some of them
also have principles,

27:54.306 --> 27:57.409
and Borns Tech
is one such company.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.746
We are in the business
of making the tools

27:59.779 --> 28:03.515
our troops need
to win the war on terror.

28:03.582 --> 28:07.753
We're in the business
of protecting American soil,

28:07.754 --> 28:11.423
and we're in the business of
protecting American values...

28:11.490 --> 28:13.893
values like truth.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.762
And the sad truth

28:16.763 --> 28:20.099
is that Ryan Larson
was an unhappy man

28:20.166 --> 28:23.469
whose wife was having an affair,

28:23.535 --> 28:25.437
and he took his own life

28:25.504 --> 28:27.974
It's a tragedy.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.309
His wife Gina Larson
accepted it,

28:30.376 --> 28:33.780
and she had somehow
made peace with it,

28:33.813 --> 28:36.949
when Mr. McBride
convinced her

28:37.016 --> 28:39.218
that there was money to be had.

28:40.787 --> 28:43.422
And Mr. McBride
asks you to believe

28:43.489 --> 28:45.791
in this fantasy

28:45.792 --> 28:48.660
because he cannot substantiate

28:48.795 --> 28:50.596
his version of reality
with facts.

28:50.662 --> 28:53.132
I man, consider what they're
asking you to swallow...

28:53.199 --> 28:54.566
that we blew up Ryan Larson

28:54.633 --> 28:57.703
and while we were at it
we ran over his sister,

28:57.804 --> 28:59.571
assaulted her attorney,

28:59.638 --> 29:03.442
got his witnesses convicted
of drug trafficking,

29:03.509 --> 29:04.877
and killed a snitch

29:04.944 --> 29:09.048
and hid it in the trunk
of Mr. McBride's car.

29:09.115 --> 29:11.683
How industrious we are.

29:11.818 --> 29:13.820
And he wants you to believe,

29:13.886 --> 29:16.422
in a feeling of injustice

29:16.488 --> 29:19.225
for the common man
fighting the good fight

29:19.291 --> 29:22.161
against the big bad corporation.

29:23.329 --> 29:29.168
But Mr. McBride
is not a common man.

29:29.235 --> 29:31.170
He is a con man.

29:32.604 --> 29:36.508
And while he may elicit
your feelings of compassion...

29:40.746 --> 29:43.049
feelings are not facts.

29:52.724 --> 29:55.794
Mr. McBride? Rebuttal?

30:03.435 --> 30:04.470
Ahem.

30:18.250 --> 30:21.053
Callie Senate is
an excellent attorney.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.554
I've known her a long time.

30:24.123 --> 30:26.525
And she's just doing her job.

30:26.592 --> 30:28.694
And I'm doing mine.

30:28.760 --> 30:31.230
Does she want to win?
Of course.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.265
Do I? Of course.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.001
That is the job.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.705
So we follow these
rules and regulations,

30:39.771 --> 30:43.275
and sometimes
we can't introduce
things that we want to.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.977
Someone objects.

30:45.044 --> 30:46.678
Or there's a law that...

30:46.745 --> 30:50.716
a rule that the judge says
he can't allow something.

30:50.782 --> 30:52.118
That happens.

30:53.652 --> 30:55.554
But here's the great thing
about the law,

30:55.621 --> 30:57.089
and I love the law.

30:57.156 --> 30:59.225
I wouldn't have gotten
into it if I didn't.

31:00.826 --> 31:02.194
The great thing about the law

31:02.261 --> 31:04.130
is at the end of the day...

31:05.397 --> 31:08.500
it doesn't really matter
what we say or think.

31:10.336 --> 31:12.504
It matters what you think.

31:15.141 --> 31:17.243
That's the beautiful thing.

31:19.778 --> 31:22.048
So here's what I have.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.121
I have a client...

31:35.962 --> 31:37.663
who lost a loved one.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.770
He blew up on a boat
owned by Borns Tech.

31:44.836 --> 31:48.507
He didn't blow up on,
you know, Bill's tuna boat.

31:48.574 --> 31:51.810
He blew up on a boat
owned by Borns Tech.

31:51.877 --> 31:53.980
I can't tell you beyond
a reasonable doubt

31:54.013 --> 31:55.881
what happened on that boat.

31:55.982 --> 31:58.017
Neither can they.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.320
But I don't have to.

32:04.556 --> 32:09.328
I only have to have
51% of your confidence.

32:09.395 --> 32:12.131
Is it more likely than not?

32:13.799 --> 32:19.338
Do I wish I could convict
this company criminally?

32:19.405 --> 32:21.607
Absolutely.

32:21.673 --> 32:23.675
Positively.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.177
But I can't.

32:25.244 --> 32:27.446
You see, these corporations
are not people.

32:27.513 --> 32:31.183
They don't bleed.
They don't cry.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.222
It's a company.

32:37.523 --> 32:40.025
They put one witness
on the stand...

32:40.026 --> 32:42.094
one...

32:42.161 --> 32:45.097
who told you she did not
tell the truth.

32:47.033 --> 32:48.634
Those are the facts.

32:50.402 --> 32:52.071
I can't do anything about that.

32:52.138 --> 32:53.705
You can't, either.

32:53.772 --> 32:55.407
That's true.

32:59.245 --> 33:02.448
When are we going to send
a message to them

33:03.882 --> 33:06.885
to quit telling us what to think

33:06.952 --> 33:10.122
and what we need
to be protected from?

33:10.189 --> 33:11.890
You can use your voice

33:11.957 --> 33:16.062
to say they have done
something wrong.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.499
And if you don't think
your vote counts,

33:20.566 --> 33:22.901
if you don't think
your decision counts,

33:22.968 --> 33:24.136
you're wrong.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.443
There's an old
West African proverb,

33:31.510 --> 33:33.779
and I'm going to be
paraphrasing this,

33:33.845 --> 33:38.550
that says if you think you're
too small to make an impact,

33:38.617 --> 33:42.388
try spending the night in
a room with a few mosquitoes.

34:10.216 --> 34:13.185
Lucy Kittridge.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.755
My protégé. Mm.

34:17.989 --> 34:20.458
- You betrayed me.
- No.

34:20.525 --> 34:24.763
You told Billy about Stoltz.

34:24.830 --> 34:27.933
No.

34:27.998 --> 34:30.136
I loved you.

34:30.168 --> 34:35.274
Oh?
Is that why you ch...

34:35.341 --> 34:37.775
chose to kill me?

34:43.849 --> 34:47.219
You betrayed everything
that I believed in.

34:49.255 --> 34:52.690
The law, the work we do,
us, my brother.

34:55.327 --> 34:59.298
You only care
about money and power.

34:59.365 --> 35:00.365
No.

35:03.802 --> 35:06.071
And what can be
more evil than that?

35:10.642 --> 35:12.311
Not evil.

35:18.350 --> 35:21.820
Not entire... tirely.

35:23.855 --> 35:24.890
I know.

35:27.193 --> 35:29.395
It's what makes this so sad.

36:34.260 --> 36:36.395
How could they have
deliberated for one day?

36:36.462 --> 36:37.896
That makes no sense.

36:37.963 --> 36:39.965
Oh, did you call Gina?

36:40.031 --> 36:42.434
- No, Marva did.
- Okay.

36:44.436 --> 36:45.971
- Oh, do you have your keys?
- Yes.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.273
Yeah.

36:48.374 --> 36:50.409
Ohh, my God.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.450
- No.
- Hey.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.018
No.

37:00.085 --> 37:01.720
- Billy.
- Today?

37:01.787 --> 37:03.689
- Billy, can I just...
- Oh, go away, Brittany.

37:03.755 --> 37:05.032
Can I just talk to you
for a second?

37:05.056 --> 37:06.292
No. Come on.

37:06.325 --> 37:07.926
No, you don't get to talk to him

37:07.993 --> 37:09.295
because you fucked us.

37:09.361 --> 37:10.905
- Patty, let me just talk...
- You understand that?

37:10.929 --> 37:11.863
...for a second, okay?

37:11.930 --> 37:13.432
Yeah, do some good
and walk away.

37:13.499 --> 37:15.300
- Do something good...
- I don't have...

37:15.301 --> 37:16.902
...and walk the fuck
away, Brittany.

37:16.968 --> 37:20.339
Billy, please just talk to me
for five minutes. Please?

37:20.406 --> 37:21.707
Billy, you blocked my number.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.308
Back off, honey,
you're gonna get hurt.

37:23.309 --> 37:24.910
How am I supposed
to talk to you?

37:24.976 --> 37:26.345
Billy, please!

37:26.412 --> 37:27.846
Billy, please, please,

37:27.913 --> 37:29.881
please just talk to me
for five minutes!

37:29.948 --> 37:31.216
Come on!

37:49.335 --> 37:50.936
Oh. Thank you.

37:58.944 --> 38:01.347
They're not looking at us.

38:02.514 --> 38:04.350
Doesn't mean anything.

38:17.228 --> 38:18.530
Okay, then.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.668
Ahem.

38:27.406 --> 38:29.675
Claim 1, question 1.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.810
Was the death of Ryan Larson

38:31.877 --> 38:35.381
caused by the wrongful
actions of Borns Tech?

38:35.414 --> 38:38.517
The jury says yes.

38:38.584 --> 38:41.019
Claim 1, question 2.

38:41.086 --> 38:43.622
Did the defendant establish

38:43.689 --> 38:45.924
an affirmative defense
of advice of counsel,

38:45.991 --> 38:48.026
rendering them
not legally liable

38:48.093 --> 38:50.261
for Ryan Larson's death?

38:50.396 --> 38:51.963
The jury answer...

38:53.031 --> 38:54.833
no.

38:54.900 --> 38:57.403
Having found
in the affirmative
to question 1

38:57.436 --> 38:58.837
and the negative to question 2,

38:58.904 --> 39:02.408
the jury proceeds
to question 3: damages.

39:02.474 --> 39:04.275
Your Honor, I would like
to be heard, please.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.845
You may not be heard,
Miss Senate.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.413
Ahem.

39:08.414 --> 39:09.948
Pain and suffering.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.217
Based on the nature
of Ryan Larson's death,

39:12.283 --> 39:15.220
the likelihood
his death was immediate,

39:15.286 --> 39:17.523
the jury awards damages

39:17.589 --> 39:20.125
in the amount of one dollar.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.861
Number 2, actual damages

39:22.928 --> 39:25.497
based on Ryan Larson's
life expectancy,

39:25.564 --> 39:28.099
the jury awards
the Larson family

39:28.166 --> 39:31.269
$100,000.

39:31.336 --> 39:32.871
Yes.

39:32.938 --> 39:34.773
That's it?

39:35.841 --> 39:39.611
And finally claim 2, question 1.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.781
Did Borns Tech commit fraud

39:42.848 --> 39:46.351
in regards to the cause
of Ryan Larson's death?

39:46.452 --> 39:49.721
yes.

39:52.558 --> 39:55.093
Having found in
the affirmative
to question 1,

39:55.160 --> 39:58.830
the jury proceeds
to determine damages.

39:58.897 --> 40:02.200
The jury awards
the Larson family damages

40:02.267 --> 40:06.705
in the amount of 162...

40:07.973 --> 40:10.709
million dollars.

40:15.614 --> 40:18.884
Your Honor, I would like
to be heard now, please.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.419
You've been heard, Ms. Senate,

40:21.487 --> 40:23.154
and the jury's given you
their answer.

40:23.221 --> 40:25.824
You don't like it,
take it up on appeal.

40:26.892 --> 40:30.061
The jury is thanked and excused.

40:34.700 --> 40:36.034
Can I have a word, please?

40:36.101 --> 40:37.435
Sure.

40:49.548 --> 40:51.249
$25 million paid today.

40:51.316 --> 40:54.520
Waive all appeals,
no claim of responsibility.

40:54.586 --> 40:55.687
Over and done.

40:55.754 --> 40:57.689
- No.
- Was I talking to you?

40:57.756 --> 40:59.357
This verdict is off the charts.

40:59.424 --> 41:01.126
It'll be set aside
by the court of appeals.

41:01.192 --> 41:02.528
We'll take our chances, okay?

41:02.561 --> 41:04.930
Between appeals
and motions of remittitur

41:04.996 --> 41:07.633
and the present-day value,
by the time you get it...

41:07.699 --> 41:08.867
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

41:08.934 --> 41:10.936
Uh, are you under the impression

41:11.002 --> 41:12.237
that you won?

41:12.303 --> 41:13.839
Because you did not

41:13.905 --> 41:16.742
at all. You did
the opposite of winning.

41:18.243 --> 41:19.778
Right? I mean...

41:19.845 --> 41:24.550
25 million today in hand.

41:27.853 --> 41:29.921
50 million and
an admission of guilt.

41:29.988 --> 41:33.725
God damn, you just got
a jury verdict.

41:33.792 --> 41:36.928
50 million and a clear admission

41:36.995 --> 41:39.898
of what happened on that
goddamn boat, okay?

41:39.965 --> 41:41.633
That's it.

41:43.234 --> 41:45.771
Could everybody give
Mr. McBride and myself

41:45.837 --> 41:47.138
the room, please?

41:47.205 --> 41:49.775
Bad idea.
I strongly urge

41:49.841 --> 41:51.442
against any kind
of communication...

41:51.577 --> 41:53.244
Jesus Christ, Leonard, please.

41:53.311 --> 41:55.881
- Wendell...
- I... I would like
to have the room

41:55.947 --> 41:58.049
with just Mr. McBride
and myself.

42:02.287 --> 42:03.589
Thank you.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.010
Look, I don't know what happened

42:16.034 --> 42:18.236
on that boat that night, okay?

42:21.406 --> 42:22.808
But it wasn't a suicide.

42:22.874 --> 42:25.744
So you can tell his family that.

42:25.811 --> 42:27.612
That's not good enough.

42:27.613 --> 42:28.947
What?

42:29.014 --> 42:30.916
Of course that's good enough.

42:30.982 --> 42:32.542
What do you think,
I'm gonna sit in here

42:32.618 --> 42:34.620
and sign a goddamn confession?

42:34.653 --> 42:37.689
You just won a trial,
for Christ's sakes.

42:37.756 --> 42:38.790
Let's get...

42:38.857 --> 42:40.291
get this over with.

42:49.134 --> 42:50.636
Mr. Corey...

42:53.338 --> 42:54.673
come on.

43:03.281 --> 43:05.483
He was dumping fuel.

43:05.550 --> 43:07.318
Okay?

43:07.385 --> 43:09.855
He wasn't supposed to.

43:09.921 --> 43:11.957
Fuel for the cluster weapon.

43:12.023 --> 43:12.791
And bombs.

43:12.858 --> 43:15.794
No... There
aren't bomb...

43:17.262 --> 43:18.797
The fuel is the weapon.

43:18.864 --> 43:21.967
Okay? The fuel's what
does all the damage.

43:23.234 --> 43:24.569
You can't test it

43:24.670 --> 43:26.672
because you're not
supposed to have it.

43:27.839 --> 43:29.741
And if you're not
supposed to have it...

43:30.742 --> 43:32.343
you can't get rid of it.

43:34.079 --> 43:37.148
We got worried
there was going to be
a surprise inspection.

43:37.215 --> 43:39.718
Ryan Larson stepped up,

43:39.785 --> 43:42.153
solved the problem for us.

43:52.163 --> 43:55.466
I wonder who had
Rachel Kennedy killed.

43:55.533 --> 43:57.703
It wasn't us.

43:59.470 --> 44:00.706
We don't kill people.

44:00.772 --> 44:02.908
Oh, come on, Mr. Corey.

44:02.974 --> 44:04.375
What do you mean
you don't kill...

44:04.442 --> 44:06.353
Let me make the distinction.
We don't murder people.

44:06.377 --> 44:10.849
We kill enemies of the state.
There's a difference.

44:13.084 --> 44:15.721
We didn't kill your girlfriend.

44:20.258 --> 44:21.993
Girlfriend.

44:27.465 --> 44:30.435
Uh, we're good. Let's go.

44:47.318 --> 44:49.888
What? What happened?

44:49.955 --> 44:52.223
Well, other than some
phone troubles...

44:52.290 --> 44:53.524
What phone troubles?

44:53.591 --> 44:55.660
It's okay. We're good.

44:55.761 --> 44:56.828
We got the 50 million.

44:56.895 --> 44:58.663
- Fuck off.
- Yeah.

44:58.764 --> 45:00.631
Stop.

45:00.766 --> 45:02.567
Holy shit.

45:02.633 --> 45:04.169
- Hi.
- Hey. What's up?

45:04.235 --> 45:06.004
Did you just call me?
What do you need?

45:06.071 --> 45:07.773
Come here a minute.

45:13.411 --> 45:16.114
Uh, I'm not so good
with gadgets.

45:16.181 --> 45:18.583
I was trying to get a video,
but all I got was audio here,

45:18.649 --> 45:21.486
so I was wondering if maybe
you could help me out with it.

45:21.552 --> 45:22.888
Let me see it.

45:24.455 --> 45:25.991
The fuel is the weapon.

45:26.057 --> 45:30.061
Okay? The fuel's what
does all the damage.

45:30.128 --> 45:31.562
You can't test it

45:31.629 --> 45:34.232
because you're not
supposed to have it.

45:34.299 --> 45:36.467
And if you're not
supposed to have it...

45:37.803 --> 45:40.371
you can't get rid of it.

45:40.438 --> 45:41.940
Yeah, that's, uh,

45:42.007 --> 45:43.408
that's a serious phone issue,

45:43.474 --> 45:44.886
but I think I know
someone who can fix it.

45:44.910 --> 45:46.444
You mind if I, uh...

45:47.578 --> 45:49.014
Be my guest.

46:16.574 --> 46:18.076
- Hey.
- Hey.

46:19.945 --> 46:22.213
- Huh.
- Sorry about the case.

46:23.448 --> 46:24.715
You can't win them all,

46:24.850 --> 46:27.385
only this was a big one.

46:27.452 --> 46:30.721
Well, Donald figures
he'll be voted out,

46:30.856 --> 46:34.559
so he asked me to collect
some of his personal things.

46:37.295 --> 46:39.197
I wonder who they'll
move in here.

46:40.899 --> 46:43.401
If we'd won,
it could have been me.

46:43.468 --> 46:45.236
That was my plan anyway.

46:46.737 --> 46:48.406
I'm sure it was.

46:51.476 --> 46:53.011
You smell good.

46:55.981 --> 46:58.516
So what are you going to do now?

46:58.583 --> 47:00.886
Why? Am I fired?

47:00.919 --> 47:03.021
I'm sure you already knew that.

47:06.724 --> 47:09.060
So the partners have spoken.

47:10.896 --> 47:13.498
Here I thought
I was being so clever,

47:13.564 --> 47:16.902
helping Wendell
throw Donald to the wolves.

47:19.770 --> 47:21.572
Ç'est la vie.

47:21.639 --> 47:23.741
It should be you.

47:23.808 --> 47:25.510
It should be you in charge now.

47:27.946 --> 47:29.747
I don't want it.

47:29.814 --> 47:33.018
How very Julius Caesar of you.

47:36.221 --> 47:39.090
Is everything
a game to you, Callie?

47:40.926 --> 47:43.361
And you don't play
any games, Michelle?

47:47.298 --> 47:48.299
No.

49:24.595 --> 49:26.931
Hi. You've reached Rachel.
I'm not home right now,

49:27.032 --> 49:29.134
but leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

49:29.200 --> 49:31.169
Thanks.
Have a great day. Bye.

49:37.408 --> 49:39.477
Hi. You've reached Rachel.
I'm not home right now,

49:39.544 --> 49:41.479
but leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

49:41.546 --> 49:43.514
Thanks.
Have a great day. Bye.

50:22.520 --> 50:25.123
The doctor adjusted your levels.

50:26.023 --> 50:27.125
Hmm.

50:27.192 --> 50:29.060
You should feel
more comfortable soon.

50:32.097 --> 50:33.864
And your pressure's stable.

50:33.931 --> 50:35.366
Hmm.

50:39.870 --> 50:42.573
Sorry if I'm interrupting.

50:45.443 --> 50:47.345
Can you...

50:49.280 --> 50:51.549
let us have some privacy?

50:51.616 --> 50:54.819
I'd like to
talk to my old friend.

50:57.021 --> 50:58.122
Just a few minutes.

50:58.123 --> 50:59.624
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.

51:01.959 --> 51:03.194
Hmm.

51:07.132 --> 51:08.499
Hmm.

51:17.608 --> 51:19.910
I hate to see this
happen to you.

51:19.977 --> 51:22.547
Ohh.

51:25.416 --> 51:28.386
Oh, Billy.

51:38.163 --> 51:40.498
Wow. You...

51:43.401 --> 51:45.703
You know me, don't you?

51:50.508 --> 51:53.744
Yeah. I know you.
I sure do.

51:53.811 --> 51:55.813
And that feels good.

51:58.883 --> 52:00.818
To be known.

52:07.592 --> 52:14.199
But... you think you're
the good guy, don't you?

52:17.101 --> 52:19.704
No, Donnie, I don't.

52:19.770 --> 52:22.207
Yes, you do. Ohh.

52:27.578 --> 52:31.382
You... You come down here.

52:44.295 --> 52:46.597
I do think you are the good guy.

52:50.235 --> 52:51.702
That's why...

52:55.273 --> 52:57.242
Look, I know you cannot...

52:57.275 --> 53:00.278
cannot let me suffer like this.

53:05.350 --> 53:07.585
Not even me.

53:08.453 --> 53:11.256
I'm close anyhow.

53:18.629 --> 53:19.864
Help me.

53:24.001 --> 53:25.703
It'll be easy.

53:30.174 --> 53:32.277
You don't give up, do you?

53:34.745 --> 53:37.348
You still trying
to get me put away.

53:45.122 --> 53:48.793
Yeah, I'd help you.
I'd show mercy,

53:48.859 --> 53:50.428
even to you.

53:52.697 --> 53:54.299
But you see...

53:56.401 --> 53:58.303
it's against the law.

54:04.642 --> 54:07.612
It burns you up
to think I beat you.

54:09.414 --> 54:11.416
You want to hear
something worse?

54:13.384 --> 54:15.620
I wasn't even fighting you.

54:19.457 --> 54:21.426
You know your friend
Rachel Kennedy?

54:21.492 --> 54:22.960
Don't start with me.

54:23.027 --> 54:25.730
Don't you fuck with me.

54:25.796 --> 54:28.966
She wasn't the one
we were trying to get.

54:29.033 --> 54:30.901
You were supposed to get it.

54:30.968 --> 54:32.803
She took yours.

54:32.870 --> 54:36.974
Oh, I'd kill you right now
myself if I could,

54:37.041 --> 54:40.244
and I would spit in your face.

54:48.486 --> 54:50.355
It's not going to work.

54:50.421 --> 54:52.189
It's not going to work, sir.

54:52.256 --> 54:53.624
"Sir."

55:45.410 --> 55:47.011
You know, Donnie...

55:49.514 --> 55:51.215
I really do hope it's true

55:51.281 --> 55:54.018
that your life
passes in front of you.

56:04.294 --> 56:06.431
You'll just drift away.

56:40.064 --> 56:41.699
You want some whiskey?

59:10.648 --> 59:12.216
You stinker!
