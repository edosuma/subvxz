WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:04.370
- You sure the controller's
not busted?

00:04.372 --> 00:06.205
- You wish.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.340
- Hey, don't hate on her 'cause
she's whupping you, burgess.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.608
- Seriously,
these buttons are stuck.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.343
- Seriously, you're not good.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.278
- [scoffs]

00:13.280 --> 00:16.615
[phone beeps]

00:16.617 --> 00:19.284
- Hey, vinessa,
finish that homework, huh?

00:19.286 --> 00:20.519
One second.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.489
- So why don't you guys
work together anymore?

00:23.491 --> 00:26.191
- What's up?
- Um...

00:26.193 --> 00:28.293
Uh, because your brother's
in intelligence now.

00:28.295 --> 00:29.461
He's a big shot.

00:29.463 --> 00:32.264
- Oh, why aren't you?
- Right. Okay.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.399
Be right there.

00:33.401 --> 00:34.901
- That's a good question.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.402
- Yo, burgess,
something just popped off.

00:36.404 --> 00:37.820
Will you, uh...

00:37.821 --> 00:39.237
- Yeah, yeah, no worries.
I got her.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.740
- Hey, vinessa, be good, girl.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.743
[door closes]

00:44.745 --> 00:47.679
- Hey, it's okay.
He'll be back soon.

00:47.681 --> 00:50.482
All right, let's do this.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.084
Oh, no.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.353
[helicopter blades thrumming]

00:54.355 --> 00:56.422
- Sergeant.
- Thanks.

00:56.424 --> 00:57.489
Commander.

00:57.491 --> 01:00.392
- Victim's name
was mya watkins.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.978
She was a state's witness

01:02.979 --> 01:05.563
Set to testify
in a theft case this week.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.367
Shooter walked up, put two
in her head, and ran off.

01:08.369 --> 01:12.438
[police radio chatter]

01:20.214 --> 01:22.114
- How old is she, ten?

01:22.116 --> 01:23.482
- Yeah.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.124
- Clear everything
off your plate.

01:32.126 --> 01:34.326
This is the only case
that matters.

01:37.665 --> 01:40.099
- Homicide found
two 9-mil shell casings

01:40.101 --> 01:41.717
Next to the body.

01:41.718 --> 01:43.334
They're on their way
to ballistics for analysis now.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.603
- Any witnesses?

01:44.605 --> 01:46.305
- Zip.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.240
This was a message
to the neighborhood--

01:48.242 --> 01:49.842
"don't snitch."

01:49.844 --> 01:51.410
- Please come forward.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.245
Any information
that you give us

01:53.247 --> 01:55.414
Will be kept
completely confidential.

01:55.416 --> 01:58.250
That's my number on that card.
So you call that number,

01:58.252 --> 02:00.152
It'll be me
on the other end of the phone.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.653
Ma'am, ma'am.
- Mya, mya...

02:01.655 --> 02:03.489
- Ma'am, i can't let you
do that--ma'am, ma'am.

02:03.491 --> 02:05.390
- No, mya!
- I can't let you do that ma'am.

02:05.392 --> 02:07.593
- No, let me go!
I want to see her!

02:07.595 --> 02:10.294
Mya!
No, let me go!

02:10.297 --> 02:11.363
Please!
- Ma'am--

02:11.365 --> 02:13.365
- She's all alone!

02:13.367 --> 02:16.635
Please! No!

02:16.637 --> 02:19.838
- We're gonna find who did that.
- [sobbing]

02:19.840 --> 02:22.374
- You got my word.
- No!

02:22.376 --> 02:24.510
- Come on, come on, come on.

02:24.512 --> 02:25.811
- [continues sobbing]

02:25.813 --> 02:28.413
- I promise you.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.486
- James grant,
senior at anderson high

02:34.488 --> 02:36.321
And star forward
on the basketball team.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.806
- Kid's a lock for the pros.

02:37.807 --> 02:39.290
- Yeah, except robbery-burglary
picked him up

02:39.293 --> 02:41.293
For holding up a corner store
a couple months back.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.395
Charges wouldn't stick
without an eyeball witness.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.631
Mya was the only one
willing to go on the record.

02:45.633 --> 02:46.798
- So she was the only thing

02:46.800 --> 02:48.433
That stood
between grant going pro...

02:48.435 --> 02:50.536
- And spending the next
five years in stateville.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.204
- All right,
the coach confirmed it.

02:52.206 --> 02:53.672
Grant was playing a tournament
in evanston

02:53.674 --> 02:55.641
At the time of the shooting.
- Maybe that was the plan--

02:55.643 --> 02:58.343
Have eyes on grant while mya
gets shot somewhere else.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.612
- This kid's connected enough
to order a hit on a witness?

03:00.614 --> 03:04.383
- Nope, grant's not,
but his uncle definitely is--

03:04.385 --> 03:07.252
Devon tucker, o.G. Vice lord
turned gun runner.

03:07.254 --> 03:08.487
He's been looking out
for his nephew

03:08.489 --> 03:09.755
Since the boy learned
how to dribble.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.290
- Yeah, but he's
locked up at mcc

03:11.292 --> 03:13.258
On a federal weapons charge.

03:13.260 --> 03:15.394
Think he ordered the shot
from inside?

03:15.396 --> 03:18.797
- I bet my star on it.

03:20.434 --> 03:20.566
- Let's go have a chat.

03:25.606 --> 03:28.240
- How long does it take
to pull a guy out of his cell?

03:28.242 --> 03:30.309
- Something's up.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.410
Here we go.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.844
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.846
- Warden.
Who's this?

03:34.848 --> 03:36.582
- Special agent collins, atf.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.383
We've been working tucker
for six months

03:38.385 --> 03:40.285
To get him to flip
on his weapons suppliers.

03:40.287 --> 03:42.087
- Popular guy.

03:42.088 --> 03:43.888
We like him for ordering a hit
on a ten-year-old girl.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.691
- So now that he's gonna
play ball with us,

03:45.693 --> 03:48.493
You want to come in
and spook our best lead.

03:48.495 --> 03:49.828
Sorry.
Not gonna happen.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.330
- I think what
special agent collins

03:51.332 --> 03:53.298
Is trying to say--
- i've made myself clear.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.968
Tucker's off-limits.

03:55.970 --> 03:59.938
Anyone who can't handle that
faces obstruction charges.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.480
- I'm just saying,
i'm from the neighborhood.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.449
You're always saying,
"this is our city."

04:10.451 --> 04:12.651
Well, those are my streets.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.453
And i don't mean
to take this case personally,

04:14.455 --> 04:16.021
But that little girl
was my sister's age,

04:16.023 --> 04:18.957
And that could have been her
out there on the pavement.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.959
You see the look in my eyes?

04:24.031 --> 04:26.598
Ain't this what you
brought me upstairs for?

04:28.569 --> 04:30.435
Let me do this.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:40.314 --> 04:42.281
- No one can know,
you understand?

04:42.283 --> 04:44.950
- Yep.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.952
- Hank voight for warden riggs.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.888
- [sniffs]

05:01.035 --> 05:03.769
[brakes squeal]

05:18.686 --> 05:21.353
- Keep it moving, fellas.
Keep it moving.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.822
Keep it moving.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.359
Keep it moving, gentlemen.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.531
Keep it moving.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.503
Keep it moving, fellas.
Keep it moving.

05:42.543 --> 05:46.345
The federal government
would like to welcome you

05:46.347 --> 05:48.547
To the metropolitan
correctional center

05:48.549 --> 05:50.682
In the city of chicago.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.121
We do hope you enjoy your stay.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.492
Open it up!

06:00.494 --> 06:02.127
[gate buzzes]

06:02.129 --> 06:05.397
[gate clanking]

06:16.877 --> 06:17.109
.

06:17.111 --> 06:18.928
- It's about time.

06:18.929 --> 06:20.746
Your police explorer candidates
are waiting.

06:20.748 --> 06:21.847
- Our what?

06:21.849 --> 06:23.148
- Did you not get the memo?

06:23.150 --> 06:24.950
I must have never written it.

06:24.952 --> 06:27.486
Show them around the district
and then report back.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.020
If any of them have
what it takes to be the police,

06:29.022 --> 06:30.455
I want to know.

06:30.457 --> 06:31.790
- It'd be our pleasure.

06:31.792 --> 06:32.891
- It would?

06:32.893 --> 06:34.126
- Hell, yeah, it would.

06:34.128 --> 06:36.428
I was a police explorer.

06:36.430 --> 06:37.662
- Oh.

06:37.664 --> 06:38.663
- Where are they?

06:38.665 --> 06:40.565
- Officers roman and burgess,

06:40.567 --> 06:42.734
Meet, uh...

06:42.736 --> 06:45.404
Dylan, carlos, and...

06:45.406 --> 06:46.905
- Sparrow.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.674
- Oh, god, whatever happened
to names like mike and tommy?

06:49.676 --> 06:51.643
- What's up
with the frowns, guys?

06:51.645 --> 06:54.880
You're police now.
Come on, get psyched.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.417
- As far as anyone knows,

06:58.419 --> 06:59.985
They're detainees
like any other,

06:59.987 --> 07:01.553
Which means
they'll be treated as such.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.522
I mean, only the warden
knows they're inside.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.957
Anyone else finds out,
it'll shut us down.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.492
- Who's watching over them?

07:07.494 --> 07:10.595
- One of my best undercovers.

07:21.508 --> 07:23.442
So, while atwater's
on the inside

07:23.444 --> 07:26.545
Trying to get tucker on a wire
copping to ordering the hit,

07:26.547 --> 07:29.548
We're out here
doing everything we can

07:29.550 --> 07:32.684
To i.D. The shooter and then
link him back to tucker.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.222
- Sounds like fun.
[chuckles]

07:40.060 --> 07:41.827
- That's the new commander?

07:41.829 --> 07:44.596
"sounds like fun."

07:44.598 --> 07:45.997
Weird dude.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.466
- I spoke to mya's mother.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.351
She's on her way in
for her interview.

07:49.352 --> 07:51.235
- Where we at with the shell
casings from the scene?

07:51.238 --> 07:54.005
- Firing pin signature doesn't
match anything in the database,

07:54.007 --> 07:55.640
And no usable fingerprints.

07:55.642 --> 07:56.675
Shooter was careful.

07:56.677 --> 07:57.809
- Then we go back to basics.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.244
Check every camera
we're linked to--

07:59.246 --> 08:02.614
Cpd pods, commercial,
residential surveillance.

08:02.616 --> 08:05.484
And run every in-service call
that came in last night.

08:05.486 --> 08:06.885
I want to be briefed.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.688
- Got it, boss.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.556
Hey, you got a sec?

08:16.697 --> 08:17.896
Steve kot.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.498
- Yeah?

08:19.500 --> 08:21.266
- What do you know about him?

08:21.268 --> 08:23.535
- Lawyer from
the state's attorney's office?

08:23.537 --> 08:24.870
I heard he went
right back to work

08:24.872 --> 08:26.605
The day after
his kid was killed.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.874
- Is he a stand-up guy?

08:31.979 --> 08:33.578
- I really wouldn't know.

08:33.580 --> 08:34.679
Olinsky would.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.950
- Well, he's putting together
a task force,

08:38.952 --> 08:40.619
And he wants me on it.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.554
- What?
Seriously?

08:42.556 --> 08:44.723
- Which i'm keeping
confidential.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.591
- Task force?

08:46.593 --> 08:48.693
- Yeah.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.263
Why do you look so shocked?

08:51.265 --> 08:52.631
- That's just--
[laughs]

08:52.633 --> 08:53.899
That's--

08:53.901 --> 08:55.600
It's big.

08:55.602 --> 08:57.702
- Yeah.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.639
So, if they came to you
and it was offered,

09:00.641 --> 09:01.640
What would you--
[voice murmurs]

09:01.642 --> 09:03.275
Shh--

09:11.652 --> 09:13.718
- Hey, herrera,
you're with me today.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.719
- You got it, boss.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.155
- Yeah, just call me parish.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.858
I see you transferred in
from medium-security?

09:19.860 --> 09:20.859
- Greenville.

09:20.861 --> 09:23.562
- Well, this ain't greenville.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.230
You ever seen <i> jurassic park?</i>

09:25.232 --> 09:26.565
- A long time ago.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.150
- Yeah, well, at the beginning,

09:28.151 --> 09:29.734
The raptors
in the electrical cages,

09:29.736 --> 09:32.304
They keep testing
the different walls

09:32.306 --> 09:34.239
For any hint of weakness.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.808
Well, that's what
this prison is.

09:36.810 --> 09:40.912
It's a bunch of animals
looking for weakness.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.748
So you give them nothing.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.116
- Understood.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.918
- Yeah.

09:48.355 --> 09:51.323
You ready to get baptized?

09:51.325 --> 09:53.658
Come on.

09:53.660 --> 09:58.196
[inmates chattering,
shouting]

09:58.198 --> 10:01.166
- All right, gentlemen,
let's go.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.634
- [sighs]

10:02.636 --> 10:04.869
Tried my whole life
to avoid this place.

10:04.871 --> 10:07.272
- It's a good reminder you were
smart to keep your nose clean.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.974
- You four, with me.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.209
- I got a pops, a uncle,
two cousins all did time.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.044
You think i need a reminder?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.349
- Hey.
- Hey...

10:17.351 --> 10:20.652
Don't stare.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.270
Check that out.

10:22.271 --> 10:23.887
- Looks like our man tucker's
got an entourage, huh?

10:23.890 --> 10:26.391
- With his street cred,
he better have a whole army.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.760
- You said don't stare.

10:28.762 --> 10:31.229
- Do as i say, not as i do.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.897
- Reynolds, matt.

10:32.899 --> 10:34.232
You're in here.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.867
- Be safe.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.675
- Thank you, sir.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.210
- Hey, you need to know

10:45.212 --> 10:47.178
I run my house
like a reputable convict.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.913
You keep the toilet spotless,

10:48.915 --> 10:50.882
And you walk
in a precise manner.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.283
That way, we don't bump
into each other

10:52.285 --> 10:55.420
In a way that would make
the other uncomfortable.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.055
- Is that it?
- That's it.

10:57.057 --> 11:00.291
- All right, that works for me.

11:12.105 --> 11:15.006
- What mya did,
coming forward like that,

11:15.008 --> 11:16.307
It took courage.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.376
- Courage got me nothing.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.378
Nothing.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.180
And grant's gonna walk,
isn't he?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.715
Just 'cause he can make
a jump shot.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.350
- Not if we can find somebody

11:25.352 --> 11:27.419
Who can tie the shooter
to grant.

11:27.421 --> 11:30.455
- Already tried
to help the cops once,

11:30.457 --> 11:32.223
And what did it get me?

11:35.162 --> 11:37.829
- You live a block away.

11:37.831 --> 11:41.332
If you can think of anybody
who might have seen something...

11:41.334 --> 11:43.368
- And get them killed too?

11:46.373 --> 11:49.340
- If james grant
is responsible for mya's death,

11:49.342 --> 11:52.477
He will not get away with it.

11:53.914 --> 11:57.248
- I don't believe a word

11:57.250 --> 11:59.851
Out of your mouth.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.086
Can i go now?

12:01.088 --> 12:02.887
I got to go make
funeral arrangements

12:02.889 --> 12:05.356
For my daughter.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.025
- Whoa, hold up there.
Counselor, hold up.

12:07.027 --> 12:09.127
- That's him!
You son of a bitch!

12:09.129 --> 12:10.495
You killed my little girl!

12:10.497 --> 12:12.864
You son of--
- everybody calm down!

12:12.866 --> 12:14.265
You two, over there.

12:14.267 --> 12:17.502
Everybody else goes home
or to a holding cell.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.771
Is that understood?

12:22.342 --> 12:24.743
- High-school baller
gets pinched

12:24.745 --> 12:28.480
For a stupid crime.

12:28.482 --> 12:30.348
All of a sudden...

12:30.350 --> 12:33.952
That scholarship,
those endorsement deals,

12:33.954 --> 12:35.820
They're slipping away.

12:35.822 --> 12:39.824
It's all 'cause some little girl
saw him make a mistake.

12:39.826 --> 12:43.027
It's obvious.

12:43.029 --> 12:45.196
She's got to go away.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.332
That sound about right to you?

12:47.334 --> 12:49.267
- I haven't heard one fact

12:49.269 --> 12:51.336
Or seen one shred of evidence

12:51.338 --> 12:53.338
Linking my client
to this murder.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.923
- Well, maybe you had
uncle devon

12:54.924 --> 12:56.507
Take care
of the witness problem for you.

12:56.510 --> 12:58.810
He's got the juice
to make it happen, right?

12:58.812 --> 13:00.411
- Man, i ain't talked to d
since he went in.

13:00.413 --> 13:01.780
I--
- james...

13:01.782 --> 13:03.214
You don't have
to say anything.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.450
- I know how this looks, okay?

13:05.452 --> 13:08.520
But i had nothing to do
with killing no little girl.

13:08.522 --> 13:11.289
It's a rough neighborhood.
I'm just trying to get out.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.159
- If there are no charges,
we'll be leaving now.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.027
- Sit down!
- Are you out of your mind?

13:16.029 --> 13:17.328
- Get him out of here.
- Come here.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.396
- Don't touch me!
- Get him out of here.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.964
- Come here.
- Get your hand off me!

13:19.966 --> 13:21.900
- Hey. Sorry.

13:26.873 --> 13:29.841
- I don't care
where you were, kid.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.209
As far as i'm concerned,

13:31.211 --> 13:33.344
That was your finger
on the trigger killed mya.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.979
[thwack]
you.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.452
You're gonna answer for it.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.958
Beat it.

13:53.266 --> 13:56.301
- All right, give me a heads-up
when you pull the recordings.

13:56.303 --> 13:57.902
Thanks.

13:57.904 --> 14:00.371
- Get a hit off the pods?
- Not yet.

14:00.373 --> 14:01.906
Cpic's gonna extend
the review radius

14:01.908 --> 14:03.341
Another six blocks.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.443
- Patrol responded
to a hit-and-run collision

14:05.445 --> 14:07.145
A half mile
from our crime scene last night.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.947
Call came in minutes
after mya was killed.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.114
- Driver in a hurry
to get lost.

14:10.116 --> 14:11.282
- Partial plate
narrowed it down

14:11.284 --> 14:12.383
To a nathan hughes
in wicker park.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.618
- Hit it.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.386
[buzzer]

14:15.388 --> 14:17.055
- You don't want it,
i'll take it.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.558
- Have at it.

14:22.929 --> 14:25.396
- What are you in for, anyway?

14:25.398 --> 14:27.131
- I killed a narc.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.237
- It's a good thing
you said that to me

14:32.239 --> 14:34.372
And not some of these convicts.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.608
You come in here bragging
about notches on your belt,

14:36.610 --> 14:38.576
You're gonna
get tested, quick.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.479
- Then don't ask me next time.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.448
- West side, right?

14:43.450 --> 14:45.416
- Who wants to know?
- Oh, man, we good.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.418
Thought i recognized big homey
from the block.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.220
- Well, big homey
don't know you, man.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.488
- How you gonna tell me
what he know?

14:50.490 --> 14:52.891
- Maybe you didn't hear me.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.293
Why you asking
so many questions?

14:55.295 --> 14:59.397
- Tucker,
arms out, feet together.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.199
- What's this about?

15:01.201 --> 15:02.567
- Doc wants to see you.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.069
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.149
- There's no mention
of a medical request

15:18.151 --> 15:19.550
On the call-out roster.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.320
- It's just a smokescreen
for the other inmates.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.355
Word is that tucker
made a deal with the feds,

15:24.357 --> 15:26.524
And now he's going
into wit-sec.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.959
So take a good look at him,

15:27.961 --> 15:29.460
'cause when he leaves
this prison,

15:29.462 --> 15:32.697
You will never see
his pretty face again.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.366
- Let's go.

15:50.717 --> 15:51.149
.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.151
- Well, if this is our shooter,

15:53.152 --> 15:55.152
He's sure doing well
for himself.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.388
- You're not really considering
this task force, are you?

15:57.390 --> 15:59.123
- No.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.459
That's why i showed you the card
and asked you for your advice,

16:01.461 --> 16:02.560
For the exercise.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.062
[knock at door]

16:04.064 --> 16:05.630
- I mean, imagine
how heartbroken you'd be...

16:05.632 --> 16:07.665
Not seeing my smiling face
every day.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.234
- [laughs] you know what?
You just settled it for me.

16:10.236 --> 16:12.136
Thanks.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.438
- Meaning?

16:14.574 --> 16:15.740
- Can i help you?

16:15.742 --> 16:17.442
- Yeah, we're looking
for nathan hughes.

16:17.444 --> 16:18.977
- I'm his daughter katie.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.212
- Does your dad drive
a black bmw x5?

16:21.214 --> 16:23.648
- No, but i do.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.116
If this is about
the parking tickets,

16:25.118 --> 16:26.317
I was gonna pay them.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.719
Those jerks didn't have
to tow my car.

16:27.721 --> 16:30.455
- When was the car towed?
- Two days ago.

16:30.457 --> 16:33.091
- So the car's
still on the lot.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.361
Thank you.
- I'll call voight.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.497
- You guys done
the trust fall yet?

16:39.499 --> 16:41.032
- Huh?

16:41.034 --> 16:43.167
- They're supposed to teach you
that at orientation.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.236
What are they teaching you guys
these days?

16:45.238 --> 16:46.504
- Hey, what's going on here?

16:46.506 --> 16:47.538
- Hey.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.207
- Some police explorers.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.342
- Oh, yeah?
Taking a tour.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.311
- Guys, this is
detective olinsky.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.146
He's up in intelligence.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.181
It's a lot different
than being in uniform.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.449
All right, let's keep walking.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.784
- Whoa.
Meaning?

17:02.022 --> 17:03.221
- Two different worlds,

17:03.223 --> 17:05.123
Different ways of doing things,

17:05.125 --> 17:07.125
Treating people.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.358
All right, guys, come on.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.060
Let's go.
- Boys, when you become cops,

17:10.063 --> 17:12.096
Have the courage
to say what's on your mind.

17:12.098 --> 17:14.165
Don't hide behind
little riddles.

17:14.166 --> 17:16.367
- Hey.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.069
Peter byrne.

17:18.070 --> 17:20.104
- Is that supposed
to mean something?

17:20.106 --> 17:21.172
- See, that's the problem.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.240
You don't even
remember his name.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.275
2007, me and byrne were backup

17:24.277 --> 17:26.344
At an undercover sting
that went sideways.

17:26.346 --> 17:29.380
He was shot three times
right in front of you.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.482
I was pinned down,
but you could have helped him.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.651
Instead, you let
my partner bleed out

17:33.653 --> 17:37.088
So you could go
after the shooter.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.123
Come on, guys, this way.

17:39.125 --> 17:41.125
I'm gonna show you
the lineup room.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.835
It's a one-way mirror,

17:50.837 --> 17:52.703
So you can see me,
but i can't see you.

17:52.705 --> 17:53.955
- Hey.

17:53.956 --> 17:55.206
What the hell
just happened out there?

17:55.208 --> 17:57.442
- He asked.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.243
- There's
a chain of command, roman.

17:59.245 --> 18:02.246
- Screw the chain of command.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.315
Guys, the room
was built that way

18:04.317 --> 18:08.352
So that the witness
can remain anonymous.

18:08.354 --> 18:09.487
- Hey.

18:09.489 --> 18:10.855
What are you doing?

18:10.857 --> 18:12.657
- I'm explaining to the boys
how the mirror works.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.492
- Where?
- Where what?

18:14.494 --> 18:16.761
- Where are the boys?

18:20.233 --> 18:21.499
- Guys?

18:33.179 --> 18:35.113
- Voight spoke to the warden.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.782
Tucker's deal with atf was
further along than we thought.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.484
They're keeping him
in protective custody

18:39.486 --> 18:41.619
Until the marshals
can transfer him to wit-sec.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.322
- We got to get atwater
up there

18:44.324 --> 18:45.756
Before tucker disappears.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.692
- The warden was firm.

18:47.694 --> 18:50.261
Can't get any more involved.
We're on our own.

18:50.263 --> 18:54.165
- Well, there's only two ways
to get into protective custody.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.533
[blowing]

18:55.535 --> 18:56.601
Hey, lyle.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.669
Let me see that tray
for one second.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.172
[sharp whack]

19:10.216 --> 19:12.650
[inmates shouting]
- hey, back off!

19:21.895 --> 19:24.295
- Officer needs assistance
in the dining hall!

19:24.297 --> 19:26.564
Get back!

19:26.566 --> 19:32.170
- I try to treat you all
with respect, let you be men.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.805
Some of you don't get it.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.407
Fine.

19:36.409 --> 19:39.210
Lessons will be learned.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.746
Did you see who the target was?
- That one.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.748
- All right,
get him out of here.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.250
- On your feet.

19:49.255 --> 19:50.955
- What the hell did i do?

19:50.957 --> 19:53.291
- Shut your mouth, inmate.

19:53.293 --> 19:56.360
[handcuffs clicking]

19:59.199 --> 20:00.565
- You two, review the tapes.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.934
I want to know
who threw the first punch...

20:02.936 --> 20:05.903
'cause someone will go
to the hole for this.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.912
- I'm sorry to say it,

20:14.914 --> 20:17.281
But i don't think those kids
are explorers material.

20:17.283 --> 20:19.584
- Based on your expert opinion.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.219
- Yeah.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.853
What did those kids do
when they got an opportunity?

20:22.855 --> 20:23.988
They ran away.

20:29.362 --> 20:32.230
- Those kids aren't just
police explorer candidates.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.698
They're children at risk.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.266
- Wait.
What--you mean juvies?

20:35.268 --> 20:36.334
They're juvies?

20:36.336 --> 20:37.735
- If we're gonna
throw labels around,

20:37.737 --> 20:39.971
They're technically fugitives
now, thanks to you two.

20:39.973 --> 20:42.406
- Is there a reason why you
left that part out this morning?

20:42.408 --> 20:43.808
- It's like when people
ask me about you,

20:43.810 --> 20:45.776
I don't say,
"roman's a pain in my ass,"

20:45.778 --> 20:47.612
Because that would be
labeling you.

20:47.614 --> 20:48.946
Look, every few months,

20:48.948 --> 20:51.349
A judge in juvenile court
sends me a few kids

20:51.351 --> 20:53.017
She's released
on good behavior.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.553
And i pull strings to get
those kids into this district

20:55.555 --> 20:57.655
And show them they can
still turn their lives around,

20:57.657 --> 21:00.925

from omar martel.

33:51.697 --> 33:54.431
I ain't playing.
He got picked up last night.

33:54.433 --> 33:57.100
He said he's gonna flip on james
unless you give him more cash.

33:57.102 --> 33:59.703
You want to talk to me now?

33:59.705 --> 34:02.472
- He's already getting 10%
of the kid's rookie contract.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.641
- He say he needs
at least another 10.

34:10.382 --> 34:13.183
- James wanted
to cap that girl himself.

34:13.185 --> 34:14.583
Couldn't let that happen.

34:14.585 --> 34:16.652
I knew martel would be
down for whatever.

34:16.655 --> 34:18.321
Didn't think he'd jam me up.

34:18.322 --> 34:20.657
- What you want me
to tell him, big homey?

34:24.630 --> 34:27.397
- 5%, that's it.

34:28.699 --> 34:30.199
- Yo, stop talking to this fool.

34:30.202 --> 34:31.601
- Hey, this don't even
concern you, dawg.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.503
- Tucker, man,
this guy is a cop.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.172
- No, big homey.

34:35.174 --> 34:36.172
- Say what?

34:36.175 --> 34:40.277
- Yeah, it's all over d-unit.

34:40.279 --> 34:41.745
- Get the door.

34:53.292 --> 34:57.561
.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.830
[inmates shouting]

35:06.805 --> 35:08.238
- Ah!

35:37.703 --> 35:40.770
[alarm blaring]

35:42.608 --> 35:44.841
- Stop it, atwater!
It's over!

35:44.843 --> 35:47.844
It's over, kev!
Come on, come on, it's over.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.813
It's over!

35:49.815 --> 35:51.848
- Hell yeah, i'm a cop,
you punk-ass bitch!

35:51.850 --> 35:53.884
And i got you on a wire
for murder!

35:53.886 --> 35:56.353
[alarm blaring]

35:56.355 --> 35:59.422
[background commotion]

36:04.830 --> 36:06.930
- Here's the report
from the store they hit,

36:06.932 --> 36:08.465
Something else
that you can share

36:08.467 --> 36:11.701
With that judge in juvie court.

36:11.703 --> 36:14.638
- Can i have a word with you,
alone?

36:17.643 --> 36:20.210
Listen up, 'cause i'm only
gonna say this once.

36:20.212 --> 36:21.778
I messed up.

36:21.780 --> 36:24.548
I know, it's strange for me too.

36:24.550 --> 36:28.552
It was wrong of me to present
those boys as police explorers.

36:28.554 --> 36:29.653
But if it makes a difference,

36:29.655 --> 36:31.388
I'm gonna throw
the book at them.

36:31.390 --> 36:36.293
Grand theft auto, retail theft,
evading a police officer.

36:36.295 --> 36:38.195
Those three aren't gonna see
the light of day

36:38.197 --> 36:40.764
Before their 18th birthday.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.866
- Before you do any of that,
just give me a minute.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.702
- Patrolman...

36:45.704 --> 36:47.237
- You owe me.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.713
I'm letting you guys go.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.315
- You are?

36:58.317 --> 37:00.850
- When i was your age,
me and my buddies,

37:00.852 --> 37:02.819
We took an el train
for a joyride.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.888
The cop who picked us up,

37:04.890 --> 37:06.723
He could have dropped
the hammer on us,

37:06.725 --> 37:08.491
Ruined our lives.

37:08.493 --> 37:11.561
But instead, he let us go.

37:11.563 --> 37:12.862
He said,
"everybody gets one break,

37:12.864 --> 37:14.864
Even if they don't deserve it."

37:14.866 --> 37:16.633
Now this is yours.

37:16.635 --> 37:19.836
I know you guys think
this is lame,

37:19.838 --> 37:21.805
But if you ever want
to join the explorers,

37:21.807 --> 37:23.406
Like, for real,

37:23.408 --> 37:24.874
Give me a call.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.610
Changed my life.

37:26.612 --> 37:28.445
Could change yours.

37:28.447 --> 37:29.946
Now get out of here.

37:36.855 --> 37:40.757
- Officer...

37:40.759 --> 37:43.260
You know, when does
this explorers thing meet?

37:45.797 --> 37:47.964
- Saturday morning, 8:00.

37:57.342 --> 37:58.742
- The thing about
prison ball is

37:58.744 --> 38:00.477
You don't want to be
the punk on fouls.

38:00.479 --> 38:01.878
Makes you look soft.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.614
That's how you end up
being someone's sweetheart.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.827
[engine turns over]

38:19.598 --> 38:22.666
[siren wailing]

38:42.954 --> 38:45.555
- Hey, ms. Watkins...

38:45.557 --> 38:47.791
I wanted you to hear
from me first.

38:50.896 --> 38:53.863
We got him.

38:53.865 --> 38:55.765
We got grant; we got his uncle;
we got the shooter.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.567
We got 'em all.

39:01.807 --> 39:03.440
- Thank you.

39:03.442 --> 39:04.941
- All right?

39:07.346 --> 39:10.413
- [sobbing]

39:18.623 --> 39:19.923
- You know...

39:19.925 --> 39:22.692
There were other cops
at that scene that night,

39:22.694 --> 39:24.894
Not just me.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.996
- When he was bleeding out,
you were the closest one.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.631
You could have helped him.

39:28.633 --> 39:30.133
- I was in pursuit
of a known felon...

39:30.135 --> 39:31.534
- We all were there.

39:31.536 --> 39:33.737
- Wanted for a double homicide.

39:33.739 --> 39:35.606
I mean, i saw that
you were nearby,

39:35.607 --> 39:37.474
You were able
to help your partner out.

39:37.476 --> 39:38.908
So i kept going.

39:38.910 --> 39:40.744
And i'm glad i did,

39:40.746 --> 39:42.779
'cause we caught
that son of a bitch.

39:42.781 --> 39:46.449
And i would do it
exactly the same way again.

39:46.451 --> 39:48.785
So you can bring
your old partner here,

39:48.787 --> 39:50.987
And i would tell him myself.

39:50.989 --> 39:55.024
- He's back in milwaukee,
living on disability.

39:55.026 --> 39:57.861
He's gonna be in a wheelchair
for the rest of his life.

40:14.413 --> 40:16.780
- I was beginning to think
you wouldn't call.

40:16.782 --> 40:18.948
- I wasn't planning on it.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.885
- And yet, you did.

40:25.190 --> 40:27.891
- Look, i don't play politics,

40:27.893 --> 40:31.895
And i didn't become a cop
to get my picture in the paper.

40:31.897 --> 40:33.863
But last night i knelt
over the body

40:33.865 --> 40:38.134
Of a ten-year-old girl with
two bullet holes in her head.

40:38.136 --> 40:40.003
So if you're telling me
that this task force

40:40.005 --> 40:41.905
Could help me get ahead
of cases like that

40:41.907 --> 40:43.573
Instead of cleaning up
after them...

40:43.575 --> 40:45.008
- That's exactly the goal.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.076
You do well on this task force,
erin,

40:47.078 --> 40:48.478
You can write your own ticket.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.713
You can go after
any cases you want.

41:02.794 --> 41:05.161
- [sighs]

41:05.163 --> 41:07.230
- How'd you get that cut?

41:07.232 --> 41:09.966
- Doing police work.

41:09.968 --> 41:12.035
- In that new
intelligence thing?

41:12.037 --> 41:13.670
- Yeah.

41:13.672 --> 41:15.004
- Do you like it?

41:15.006 --> 41:16.906
- Yeah, i love it.

41:19.744 --> 41:21.911
- What?

41:21.913 --> 41:23.847
- Just looking at you.

41:25.750 --> 41:27.517
I'm proud of you.

41:27.519 --> 41:28.985
- Proud of you too.

41:31.756 --> 41:34.157
- You know you mean
the world to me, right?
