03:20.759 --> 03:21.879
Oh, my God.

03:24.599 --> 03:27.319
Come. Come.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.520
Sir. He's Mr. Dsousa.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.120
You brought this girl here? - Yes.

04:00.120 --> 04:02.280
Take his signed statement. - Yes.

04:03.479 --> 04:06.039
Mr. Dsousa, do not go out
of Goa for the next few days...

04:06.120 --> 04:07.319
...without informing us.

04:07.599 --> 04:08.639
Okay.

04:09.199 --> 04:10.119
Come.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.840
Sir, this is Dr. Menon.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.560
He's handling the female's case.

04:16.279 --> 04:17.319
Hello, Doctor. - Hello.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.160
Vargese.

04:18.240 --> 04:19.160
Insp. Vargese.

04:19.240 --> 04:20.319
Dr. Menon. - Okay.

04:20.439 --> 04:21.439
What do you think, doctor?

04:21.560 --> 04:22.839
How soon can she
regain consciousness?

04:23.120 --> 04:24.199
It's hard to say.

04:24.319 --> 04:25.959
She was brought here
in a very bad shape.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.080
Looking at her condition...

04:27.160 --> 04:30.200
...we can imagine that
she struggled really hard.

04:30.639 --> 04:31.439
She's out of it now.

04:31.519 --> 04:34.199
But only after a
CT Scan can we say...

04:34.519 --> 04:37.199
...how successful her struggle was.

04:37.680 --> 04:38.840
Did you find anything
in her clothes?

04:38.920 --> 04:41.240
Some ID...
Any kind of identification?

04:41.600 --> 04:42.520
No.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.760
And I feel you'll have
to wait for a long time...

04:44.839 --> 04:46.479
...to take her statement.

04:46.639 --> 04:50.360
In such cases and conditions and
formal cases the patients...

04:51.240 --> 04:52.800
Okay, doctor. - Excuse me!

04:59.360 --> 05:00.600
Stay alert.

05:01.240 --> 05:03.360
Whoever did this can strike again.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.160
Inform me first when
she regains consciousness.

05:07.079 --> 05:08.039
Okay?

05:08.480 --> 05:10.720
I should be the first one.
- Sure, sir.

05:10.839 --> 05:11.879
Alright, see you.

05:33.120 --> 05:36.240
Sir...that girl's still alive.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.199
Gaekwad, how long are
you going to stand here?

05:42.600 --> 05:44.040
Go get a cup of tea.

05:44.639 --> 05:45.680
I'll stay here. - Yes.

05:45.800 --> 05:46.720
And yes.

05:46.839 --> 05:49.079
Get me a nice cup of tea too.
- Yes, sir.

07:06.879 --> 07:07.800
Oh, my god!

07:11.279 --> 07:12.079
Ma'am...

07:12.800 --> 07:15.800
Ma'am...are you okay?

07:16.319 --> 07:17.159
What happened?

07:17.600 --> 07:18.360
Ma'am...

07:19.240 --> 07:20.480
You're in a hospital.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.960
No need to be scared.

07:22.800 --> 07:23.879
Just relax!

07:24.000 --> 07:26.240
I'll call the doctor, okay?

07:26.839 --> 07:27.839
Relax!

07:32.120 --> 07:33.360
Is everything okay, nurse?

07:33.720 --> 07:36.960
She's conscious,
but seems disoriented.

07:37.319 --> 07:39.719
Please inform your
superior officer. - Sure.

07:47.199 --> 07:48.959
And file a case against
both of them. - Okay sir.

07:50.360 --> 07:51.240
Sir!

08:01.040 --> 08:02.000
Gaekwad!

08:03.319 --> 08:04.240
Where's the girl?

08:07.079 --> 08:08.159
Sir, I was sitting right here.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.479
Where's the girl?
- She was right here.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.000
Dr. Menon examined her a while ago.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.040
And sir, I gave her sedatives
myself and tucked her in.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.600
So did she sleepwalk out of here?

08:17.600 --> 08:19.240
Were you two awake or sleeping?

08:20.680 --> 08:22.879
Gaekwad, lock this hospital down.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.279
No one gets in and no one gets out.
- Yes, sir.

08:25.399 --> 08:26.799
Alvin, relay to the headquarters...

08:26.879 --> 08:28.319
...I want more backup, right now.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.280
Where's the Dean of this hospital?

08:30.399 --> 08:31.519
Sir, ground floor.

09:45.639 --> 09:47.120
Did you see a girl here?
- No, sir.

09:47.240 --> 09:49.960
Do one thing, check
the room at the back.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.759
And D'souza, go down
and check at the reception.

09:53.080 --> 09:56.480
If you find any information
then tell sir about it. - Yes, sir.

11:13.039 --> 11:14.399
Nurse. - Yes, sir.

11:14.480 --> 11:15.960
Myself, insp. Anton.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.560
A female patient's missing
from the 2nd floor ward.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.440
Did you see anyone
heading this way...

11:20.559 --> 11:21.559
...who didn't belong here?

11:21.639 --> 11:23.439
I saw no one, sir. - Okay.

11:43.399 --> 11:46.559
Sir, the doctor wants
to speak to you urgently.

11:46.799 --> 11:49.919
Yes, doctor. - We've received
the patient's CT scan reports.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.440
She has a serious problem.

11:51.559 --> 11:54.079
She has partial cerebral
hypoxic ischemia.

11:54.200 --> 11:54.759
Meaning.

11:54.879 --> 11:57.320
Well, she didn't get oxygen
for a long time in the coffin...

11:57.720 --> 11:59.759
...which means her brain
didn't get oxygen for a long time.

11:59.879 --> 12:02.439
That's why she has
suffered some brain damage.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.320
This brain damage will
affect her coordination...

12:04.399 --> 12:07.319
...between the brain and muscles.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.440
She'll suffer seizures.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.079
She can also have hallucinations.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.080
We call it delusion.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.840
It needs to be cured.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.800
If she stays alone,
she can also die.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.200
Don't worry,
we will find her, doctor. - Okay.

12:19.279 --> 12:21.399
Gaekwad, I want updates
every10 minutes. - Yes sir.

12:52.200 --> 12:56.200
Father used to say,
love of the people...

12:56.960 --> 12:59.320
...and Mandar in the elections...

12:59.519 --> 13:02.120
...both are meant for winning.

13:02.399 --> 13:07.639
I've witnessed your
love in today's rally.

13:08.480 --> 13:12.759
And soon we'll witness
the enemy's defeat.

13:16.399 --> 13:18.360
Glory to... - Mandar!

13:18.440 --> 13:20.280
Glory to... - Mandar!

13:20.360 --> 13:22.240
Glory to... - Mandar!

13:22.320 --> 13:24.280
Glory to... - Mandar!

13:24.360 --> 13:26.360
Glory to... - Mandar!

13:26.440 --> 13:28.320
Glory to... - Mandar!

13:28.720 --> 13:32.720
In this political ocean
you'll come across many...

13:32.799 --> 13:34.399
...ready to reap the rewards.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.320
But a true devotee of Shiva...

13:37.679 --> 13:40.719
...is someone who's ready
to swallow poison just like Him.

13:40.960 --> 13:43.440
Mandar is a devotee of Lord Shiva.

13:43.679 --> 13:46.599
And so he promises that,
if needed...

13:46.720 --> 13:49.120
...on the holy occasion
if 'Shiv Ratri'...

13:49.240 --> 13:55.240
...he'll put his life
at stake for his brothers.

13:55.679 --> 13:57.319
It's for the protection
of righteousness.

13:57.600 --> 14:03.600
So your protection
is my duty and my deed.

14:03.679 --> 14:05.679
Glory to... - Mandar!

14:05.759 --> 14:07.759
Glory to... - Mandar!

14:07.840 --> 14:09.879
Glory to... - Mandar!

14:09.960 --> 14:11.320
Glory to... - Mandar!

14:11.440 --> 14:13.680
Glory to... - Mandar!

14:13.799 --> 14:15.799
Glory to... Mandar! - Move back!

14:15.919 --> 14:18.719
Glory to... - Mandar!

14:18.840 --> 14:21.200
Glory to... - Mandar!

14:21.559 --> 14:22.519
Come, dear. - Come.

14:22.679 --> 14:23.479
You two go home.

14:23.559 --> 14:24.599
I'll join you later.

14:24.679 --> 14:25.919
Aren't you coming along?

14:26.120 --> 14:28.679
Along with 'Shiv Ratri',
it's also Anu's birthday.

14:29.720 --> 14:30.840
You want me to blow up balloons...

14:31.240 --> 14:34.039
...and light birthday candles...

14:34.399 --> 14:35.959
...instead of preparing
for the elections.

14:37.279 --> 14:39.360
Stop this charade and go home.

14:49.559 --> 14:50.719
Have you seen today's paper?

14:51.840 --> 14:53.240
If 18 is the legal age to vote...

14:53.320 --> 14:55.640
...then why is the
legal age to booze 25?

14:56.840 --> 14:59.759
How long with the
youth be toyed around?

15:00.679 --> 15:05.159
How long with their sensibility
and values be questioned?

15:08.120 --> 15:10.240
That's Atul's new move.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.039
To draw the youth's
attention towards him.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.759
Yes, uncle.
When the sea's churned...

15:16.879 --> 15:18.519
...the demons will also
get hold of something.

15:18.639 --> 15:22.039
But you thought that demon politics.

15:23.919 --> 15:27.000
It's really sad that
he's your uncle's son.

15:48.840 --> 15:49.360
Hello.

15:49.440 --> 15:50.480
The horse moves 2Â½ paces.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.160
From E3 to F5.

15:52.480 --> 15:53.399
Make your move.

15:59.559 --> 16:04.239
I...I...I can't think
of anything right now.

16:04.399 --> 16:06.600
I don't have much time.
Make your move.

16:06.679 --> 16:11.000
I am actually...getting
late for my photography class.

16:13.399 --> 16:15.159
I have just 40 seconds.

16:15.399 --> 16:16.559
Speak up.

16:23.679 --> 16:28.879
If you move the horse, the tower...

16:29.399 --> 16:32.879
No, no, I mean the queen...

16:36.080 --> 16:40.560
I am really sorry,
I can't remember the chessboard.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.040
My mind's in the photography class.

16:44.159 --> 16:46.279
Real photos aren't
taken from the camera.

16:47.039 --> 16:49.519
Real photos are those
which get embedded in the mind.

16:50.440 --> 16:51.440
If you want to do anything life...

16:51.559 --> 16:53.719
...then forget the camera,
adjust the focus of your life.

16:53.919 --> 16:55.240
To hell with your...

16:58.840 --> 17:01.440
I'll come by 5pm, be at home.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.920
Sir, why don't we flash
her photo on television...

17:37.039 --> 17:38.359
...and make an announcement?

17:39.680 --> 17:41.320
We aren't the only ones
looking for her, Gaikwad.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.320
There's someone she's
trying to escape from.

17:43.400 --> 17:43.960
If we make an announcement...

17:44.039 --> 17:45.240
...it will alert those people.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.240
Okay.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.800
Quietly keep a watch on everyone.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.640
If you suspect anyone,
bring him to me.

17:50.759 --> 17:51.359
Okay. - Sir.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.240
One more thing.

17:52.359 --> 17:54.240
Find out where's the
control room for this CCTV.

17:54.359 --> 17:55.159
Okay. - Okay, sir.

17:56.079 --> 17:58.799
I had told you,
don't open these boxes.

17:59.119 --> 18:01.199
Don't open these boxes
as long as madam doesn't return.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.680
Now she'll ask who
opened the packed boxes.

18:03.799 --> 18:05.559
I didn't touch these boxes.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.160
If it wasn't you,
then was it a ghost?

18:07.279 --> 18:08.680
I don't know.

18:15.240 --> 18:16.400
She just stepped
out of the storeroom...

18:16.480 --> 18:17.319
...and she's wearing
a doctor's scrub.

18:17.640 --> 18:18.800
Keep an eye on everyone.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.240
Inform your men.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.079
Hey, stop that bus.

18:46.839 --> 18:47.679
What happened, sir?

18:47.960 --> 18:49.680
I want the number
of that van's driver.

18:49.759 --> 18:50.599
Now!

18:58.240 --> 18:58.839
Yes, who is it?

18:58.920 --> 18:59.880
Insp. Anton speaking.

18:59.960 --> 19:01.600
Park your vehicle on the
side and listen to me carefully.

19:01.680 --> 19:04.039
Yes, sir.
I am doing just that. Hold on.

19:09.039 --> 19:10.000
Yes, sir. Go ahead.

19:10.119 --> 19:11.119
There's a female in your vehicle...

19:11.200 --> 19:12.559
...wearing a doctor's scrub.

19:12.680 --> 19:13.759
Yes, sir. I will check it.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.600
No, sir.

19:17.799 --> 19:19.599
No female here is
wearing a doctor's scrub.

19:21.440 --> 19:22.480
She is jumped of the bus.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.519
Excuse me.

19:34.759 --> 19:37.319
Can...can you please help me? - Yes.

19:38.039 --> 19:40.319
Actually I've to get to Panjim.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.240
I missed my bus due
to an emergency case.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.080
I need help.

19:46.240 --> 19:48.400
You're a doctor? - Yes, yes.

19:48.559 --> 19:50.879
Actually I didn't
get time to change...

19:50.960 --> 19:52.160
...in a hurry to
catch the staff bus.

19:52.839 --> 19:53.919
Well, come right in.

19:54.839 --> 19:55.679
Thank you.

19:58.039 --> 19:59.039
Well, it's your lucky day.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.519
Because I am heading that way.

20:12.720 --> 20:17.640
Actually, I was on duty
in the operation theatre, so...

20:19.119 --> 20:20.359
So in a hurry to catch your bus...

20:20.440 --> 20:21.759
...you forgot to wear your slippers.

20:21.839 --> 20:23.039
Right? - Right.

20:24.000 --> 20:24.960
It happens.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.320
Who are we waiting for?

20:53.920 --> 20:58.360
The enemy who can't be a friend.

21:01.480 --> 21:02.680
Father used to say...

21:04.240 --> 21:08.880
...a women her place,
and a enemy his stature...

21:10.160 --> 21:12.440
...should be shown soon.

21:14.160 --> 21:16.080
Uncle? - They are here.

21:22.519 --> 21:24.200
Leave me. Leave me.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.160
Leave me. Leave me.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.480
Leave me. Please, leave me.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.360
Sir... - He's Bajirao.

21:43.559 --> 21:46.119
Sir... - He's the one
refusing to sell the shanty.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.319
Sir, sir, it was a big mistake.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.240
But what to do?

21:51.319 --> 21:53.200
That shanty is my home.

21:53.559 --> 21:55.879
It's a refuge for my wife and kids.

21:58.279 --> 21:59.799
Sir...sir...

21:59.880 --> 22:00.520
I made a big mistake.

22:00.599 --> 22:03.079
I am ready to do as you say, sir.
I made a mistake.

22:03.160 --> 22:04.920
Like you say.

22:06.640 --> 22:11.640
Tick...tick...tick...tick.

22:11.720 --> 22:12.799
Sir...sir...

22:13.680 --> 22:16.519
What does Amitabh Bachchan say...

22:16.640 --> 22:18.160
...on "Kaun Banega Crorepati".

22:19.240 --> 22:21.720
"Suyi Muyiji, calm down."

22:25.720 --> 22:27.880
You should've given your answer...

22:29.119 --> 22:31.239
...when I sent the money.

22:32.680 --> 22:37.160
Now you've run out of lifeline.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.600
I couldn't open this
bottle of cough syrup...

24:31.039 --> 24:35.639
...so I was trying to...

24:38.559 --> 24:41.879
Sonica, I love you.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.360
I know you don't love me.

24:46.559 --> 24:48.319
It doesn't make a difference to me.

24:49.960 --> 24:52.559
Because my love doesn't
need your approval.

24:53.880 --> 24:55.280
I will always look after you.

24:55.880 --> 24:59.200
And even your...grandma...

24:59.559 --> 25:02.359
...in the old age home.

25:03.279 --> 25:06.200
Just don't try to
separate yourself from me.

25:08.599 --> 25:09.799
In no way.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.000
If you part ways,
I'll be really hurt.

25:14.920 --> 25:18.440
And if I am hurt,
then your grandma will get hurt.

25:19.640 --> 25:20.960
Get it?

25:31.440 --> 25:32.920
It's almost dawn, I am going home.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.759
Take care.

26:42.359 --> 26:43.199
Have you seen this girl?

26:43.279 --> 26:44.799
No, sir! - Stop!

26:45.559 --> 26:46.240
Anybody after you?

26:46.359 --> 26:48.119
No, no one.
- let's go.

26:50.559 --> 26:51.720
Have you seen this girl?

26:53.640 --> 26:54.440
Yes, I have.

27:21.839 --> 27:22.559
Hi. - Hi.

27:22.680 --> 27:23.960
Inspector Anton Vargese.

27:24.039 --> 27:25.279
Where did you see this girl?

27:26.240 --> 27:27.759
I gave her a lift a while ago.

27:27.839 --> 27:28.919
Where did you drop her?

27:30.160 --> 27:31.440
She was saying Gabriele Road.

27:44.960 --> 27:45.759
Sir.

27:46.440 --> 27:48.880
The neighbors say
this is the only house...

27:48.960 --> 27:50.000
...that's been locked
for many years.

27:50.440 --> 27:53.240
So maybe... - No, this is the one.

27:53.480 --> 27:54.200
Let's go.

28:13.559 --> 28:14.440
It's still wet.

28:15.119 --> 28:16.239
It's been used just now.

28:16.640 --> 28:17.320
Search the place now. - Yes, sir.

28:17.640 --> 28:18.560
Now! - Okay, sir!

28:49.960 --> 28:52.640
Sir, I searched the entire house.

28:53.279 --> 28:54.200
She isn't here.

28:56.880 --> 28:57.840
She isn't afraid to die.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.200
She's avoiding the police.

29:00.799 --> 29:02.279
Sir, I don't understand one thing.

29:02.720 --> 29:04.000
Why are we following her?

29:04.640 --> 29:06.240
She hasn't committed any crime.

29:06.519 --> 29:07.839
Let her die if she wants to.

29:08.200 --> 29:09.039
What do we care?

29:09.160 --> 29:11.160
The police's job isn't
just stopping crime...

29:11.799 --> 29:13.319
...it's also protecting the people.

29:20.440 --> 29:23.120
Show her photo to
all the neighbors, okay.

29:23.440 --> 29:25.720
If you suspect anyone,
search their home.

29:26.039 --> 29:26.879
Call the forensics' team.

29:26.960 --> 29:29.000
And stay here until
they don't get here.

29:29.119 --> 29:30.519
Alright? - Yes.

30:19.519 --> 30:20.440
So you see.

30:21.640 --> 30:23.440
A direct flash on the subject...

30:24.200 --> 30:26.799
...makes the subject flat.

30:27.279 --> 30:29.960
And it creates a lot
of unnecessary shadow.

30:30.960 --> 30:32.200
You understand, Akshay?

30:34.599 --> 30:36.039
Yes...yes, sir, I get it.

30:36.119 --> 30:37.679
Basically,
bounce light off other object...

30:37.759 --> 30:40.160
...to make beautiful
subject for my next project.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.240
Right, funny boy. That will do.

30:45.119 --> 30:48.359
This week's assignment
will be on perspective.

30:48.759 --> 30:51.319
I've divided all of you
in a pair of twos for this week.

30:51.440 --> 30:53.480
We'll see how two people...

30:53.599 --> 30:57.279
...view the same sight differently.

30:58.480 --> 31:02.000
So...that will be Ankita and Ashu.

31:03.240 --> 31:04.640
Gauri and Shreyas.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.120
Rahul and Ranvir.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.240
Tulica and Vedica.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.040
Sonica and Akshay.

31:14.880 --> 31:15.960
Everybody ready?

31:16.279 --> 31:18.319
Go ahead and click Mumbai.

31:22.759 --> 31:24.079
You aren't taking photographs.

31:24.920 --> 31:25.920
Not intrested?

31:30.240 --> 31:32.319
Why? Is everything okay?

31:36.880 --> 31:38.280
I broke up with my girlfriend.

31:39.440 --> 31:40.360
Oh...

31:41.680 --> 31:42.960
...sorry to hear that.

31:43.640 --> 31:44.560
But what happened?

31:44.799 --> 31:46.000
That's exactly what
I don't understand.

31:46.480 --> 31:47.319
Her dog died.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.240
I only sent a cute message.

31:49.359 --> 31:52.679
Baby, your dog's dead.
I don't know what to do. LOL!

31:52.799 --> 31:54.919
And after that she
stopped talking to me.

31:55.039 --> 31:57.200
I mean...silly girl.

31:58.720 --> 32:01.600
You said LOL? - Yes.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.440
You're laughing. - Sorry.

32:11.519 --> 32:14.039
I am really sorry,
I know I shouldn't be laughing.

32:14.119 --> 32:16.639
But who says LOL?

32:17.599 --> 32:17.959
LOL...

32:18.039 --> 32:20.319
LOL means lots of love.

32:20.480 --> 32:23.440
Idiot, LOL means Laugh Out Loud.

32:24.440 --> 32:25.480
Oh s***

32:26.039 --> 32:27.039
That means...

32:27.720 --> 32:31.200
No wonder she's thinking that...
- Yeah, right. Exactly.

32:31.759 --> 32:34.000
Now call her up and apologies.

32:36.559 --> 32:37.319
Thanks.

32:46.519 --> 32:47.639
You're lying, aren't you?

32:52.920 --> 32:53.759
Right.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.920
But at least you LOL.

33:09.400 --> 33:13.960
"Sometimes I wrote
your name on the mirror."

33:15.319 --> 33:19.639
"Sometimes I washed
it away with my tears."

33:21.200 --> 33:25.960
"Sometimes I read
you like a letter."

33:27.039 --> 33:31.799
"Sometimes I hid you in my diary."

33:40.440 --> 33:44.880
"Sometimes I wrote
your name on the mirror."

33:46.319 --> 33:51.000
"Sometimes I washed
it away with my tears."

33:52.240 --> 33:56.559
"Sometimes I read
you like a letter."

33:58.160 --> 34:02.440
"Sometimes I hid you in my diary."

34:04.079 --> 34:09.799
"You don't leave my
sight even for a moment."

34:09.880 --> 34:14.079
"Oh Lord. Oh Lord. Oh Lord."

34:14.159 --> 34:15.639
"Oh Lord."

34:15.719 --> 34:20.039
"Oh Lord. Oh Lord. Oh Lord."

34:20.119 --> 34:21.920
"Oh Lord."

34:58.159 --> 35:09.199
"I followed shadows
desiring for you."

35:15.920 --> 35:26.599
"I followed shadows
desiring for you."

35:27.719 --> 35:38.839
"I asked every stranger
for your whereabouts."

35:40.960 --> 35:45.920
"I asked like crazy."

35:46.039 --> 35:51.440
"Without you my heart feels lost."

35:51.679 --> 35:56.079
"Oh Lord. Oh Lord. Oh Lord."

35:56.199 --> 35:57.599
"Oh Lord."

35:57.719 --> 36:02.039
"Oh Lord. Oh Lord. Oh Lord."

36:02.119 --> 36:03.799
"Oh Lord."

36:22.400 --> 36:34.039
"You don't know how long
my heart's cried without you."

36:40.079 --> 36:50.799
"You don't know how long
my heart's cried without you."

36:51.920 --> 36:57.200
"When no one wiped my tears."

36:57.840 --> 37:03.120
"I remembered your veil."

37:05.199 --> 37:10.000
"I remembered your veil."

37:10.159 --> 37:15.719
"I only hear your
voice in loneliness."

37:15.880 --> 37:20.280
"Oh Lord. Oh Lord. Oh Lord."

37:20.360 --> 37:21.760
"Oh Lord."

37:21.840 --> 37:26.240
"Oh Lord. Oh Lord. Oh Lord."

37:26.320 --> 37:27.960
"Oh Lord."

38:13.000 --> 38:17.880
My phone's...battery...

38:20.599 --> 38:22.519
I was with a friend.

38:22.599 --> 38:24.039
You have just one option.

38:25.280 --> 38:26.720
Did you come back early
because you were scared of me?

38:26.800 --> 38:29.960
Or did you get late coming
from your friend's home?

38:35.000 --> 38:37.320
I hope I didn't interfere
in your enjoyments?

38:42.559 --> 38:44.719
It's...it's not like you think.

38:45.039 --> 38:48.920
I...I was with Sheena.

38:53.199 --> 38:54.239
Sheena?

38:57.039 --> 38:59.719
Sheena. Manda.

39:00.519 --> 39:01.880
Pooja. - Smita.

39:04.400 --> 39:06.720
My men called all your friends.

39:08.159 --> 39:09.559
You weren't with any of them.

39:14.320 --> 39:17.000
I...I wasn't with anyone.

39:17.159 --> 39:19.239
Believe me.

39:22.239 --> 39:23.439
Father used to say...

39:26.000 --> 39:29.960
Ant's wings and serpent's hood...

39:31.519 --> 39:33.320
...should be squashed
in the beginning.

39:39.320 --> 39:40.519
Who were you with?

39:44.880 --> 39:46.039
Who were you with?

39:46.440 --> 39:47.679
Tell me who were you with?

39:47.880 --> 39:49.559
Tell me... Tell me...

39:52.199 --> 39:53.319
This is exactly how I feel...

39:53.400 --> 39:55.559
...when you try to
separate yourself from me.

39:57.239 --> 39:58.559
Exactly...

40:08.880 --> 40:09.840
I know.

40:11.880 --> 40:13.960
I know you went to meet some boy.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.840
I'm sparing you because
I don't have evidence.

40:17.239 --> 40:19.319
But if I find out that
my suspicion is right...

40:19.440 --> 40:22.880
...then next time you'll
out of breath for good.

40:23.039 --> 40:24.639
You won't breathe again.

40:24.719 --> 40:25.679
Get that?

40:28.440 --> 40:29.480
Hey!

40:30.800 --> 40:33.120
One of you will always be with her.

40:34.599 --> 40:35.839
Keep an eye on her.

40:57.119 --> 40:58.279
Thank you, uncle.

40:58.760 --> 41:02.920
Uncle, this guest house...

41:05.800 --> 41:08.680
You're lucky.
It was vacated just yesterday.

41:31.599 --> 41:32.480
Sonica.

41:46.760 --> 41:47.640
Akshay.

41:49.039 --> 41:49.960
Akshay.

41:50.760 --> 41:51.720
Akshay.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.120
Akshay, where are you?

41:53.599 --> 41:54.679
Akshay, I've seen you.

41:54.760 --> 41:55.760
Where are you?

42:00.559 --> 42:01.599
For God's sake, Akshay.

42:04.719 --> 42:06.319
Stop playing games, Akshay.

42:07.880 --> 42:12.800
Please come out wherever you are.

42:14.280 --> 42:15.240
Please.

42:20.840 --> 42:22.079
Akshay.

42:24.239 --> 42:25.959
Come out please, Akshay.

42:28.559 --> 42:30.239
I need you.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.039
I need you.

42:39.480 --> 42:41.559
I need you!

42:44.079 --> 42:46.199
You honored me by coming here.

42:46.400 --> 42:47.320
You respected me.

42:47.599 --> 42:49.599
You've honored our literature.

42:52.480 --> 42:53.519
Hello. - Hello.

42:53.639 --> 42:56.119
Sister-in-law,
I'm really pleased to see you here.

42:56.400 --> 42:59.320
I hope that you will like my book.

42:59.599 --> 43:01.759
I loved all your previous books...

43:01.880 --> 43:02.800
...so why won't I like this.

43:02.880 --> 43:03.840
Yes.

43:04.239 --> 43:07.039
You two carry on,
I'll go have a talk with uncle.

43:07.239 --> 43:08.959
Election problems. - Yes, yes.

43:09.039 --> 43:10.559
Hello Mandar sir...

43:10.639 --> 43:12.239
Sir... - Mandar, sir.

43:15.199 --> 43:16.399
Hello. - Hello Mandar sir...

43:19.599 --> 43:21.039
Have you lost your mind?

43:21.239 --> 43:22.199
What?

43:22.320 --> 43:23.360
Why did you bring her here?

43:23.599 --> 43:27.239
I didn't know...you're
coming here with Neha.

43:27.599 --> 43:30.400
Sister-in-law, I've been
working on this book for...

43:30.519 --> 43:32.440
She said she had a chat
with you on the phone...

43:32.559 --> 43:33.480
...so I brought her here.

43:33.599 --> 43:35.079
Hello, Neha. - Hello.

43:35.719 --> 43:37.000
I asked her to come
in the evening...

43:37.079 --> 43:38.599
...and at the club, not here.

43:41.719 --> 43:42.559
Father used to say...

43:42.679 --> 43:45.519
...copying in exams,
and the mistress's face...

43:46.440 --> 43:47.840
...are best behind the curtain.

43:50.079 --> 43:51.159
Take her away.

43:52.119 --> 43:52.920
Bye.

43:53.039 --> 43:55.039
You will find everything
in this book...

43:55.159 --> 43:56.639
...that is on your mind...
- One minute.

43:56.719 --> 43:57.639
Yes. - Okay.

43:58.719 --> 44:02.439
I'll call at home and find
out whether Anu's eaten or not.

44:06.159 --> 44:07.159
Uncle.

44:08.760 --> 44:10.560
Uncle, you're leaving.

44:10.960 --> 44:12.360
The function hasn't
even started yet.

44:13.920 --> 44:17.240
And she... who's this
beautiful girl with you?

44:20.719 --> 44:21.639
She...

44:22.519 --> 44:27.679
She's my niece...from London.

44:32.800 --> 44:33.680
I see.

44:36.119 --> 44:37.239
What's your name?

44:40.719 --> 44:42.199
I...

44:42.880 --> 44:43.840
Sonica.

44:47.599 --> 44:50.119
You've a sweet name...like you.

44:52.519 --> 44:53.440
Thanks.

44:54.119 --> 44:57.159
Now that you're here,
why don't you sit with me?

44:58.360 --> 45:01.599
We can chat and get acquainted to.

45:02.280 --> 45:03.120
Some other time.

45:04.679 --> 45:07.039
I've to go with uncle
for something important.

45:08.960 --> 45:10.119
Have to?

45:15.599 --> 45:16.519
It's so strange.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.360
We women have to do everything...

45:22.000 --> 45:23.440
...they don't want to.

45:26.320 --> 45:29.400
I didn't want to come here,
but I had to.

45:31.280 --> 45:34.720
You don't want to leave,
but you have to.

45:38.440 --> 45:39.159
Shall we?

46:39.480 --> 46:39.960
Hello.

46:40.079 --> 46:42.279
Hello, Sonica.
Professor Bajaj speaking.

46:44.960 --> 46:46.079
Hello, sir.

46:46.280 --> 46:47.120
What's wrong?

46:47.599 --> 46:49.599
You haven't been attending
class for a long time.

46:50.639 --> 46:52.639
Sir, I...

46:53.159 --> 46:55.679
Actually I am not feeling too well.

46:56.760 --> 46:57.640
I am sorry to hear that.

46:58.719 --> 46:59.759
How are you feeling now?

47:02.880 --> 47:04.360
I am better. - Good.

47:04.880 --> 47:07.320
Sonica, I needed a small favor.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.800
People from the International
Photography Journal...

47:10.079 --> 47:11.559
...are coming to interview
me this evening.

47:12.519 --> 47:14.400
Actually...they've said that...

47:14.519 --> 47:16.320
...they want to talk
to my students as well.

47:16.880 --> 47:18.880
And you're the best I've got.

47:19.679 --> 47:21.879
So I've suggested your name.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.400
So, will you be able
to make it? - Sir...

47:25.440 --> 47:26.559
Actually...

47:26.639 --> 47:29.599
Come on, Sonica. It's a request.

47:30.480 --> 47:31.679
Only for 15 minutes.

47:34.840 --> 47:36.960
Okay, sir. I'll be there.

47:37.119 --> 47:37.960
Thank you.

47:38.159 --> 47:39.319
Really, I appreciate that.

47:40.320 --> 47:41.039
Welcome.

47:41.159 --> 47:42.119
Okay. See you then.

48:01.239 --> 48:02.039
Sir...

48:04.320 --> 48:05.080
Sir...

48:08.360 --> 48:09.200
Sir...

48:25.159 --> 48:26.279
I am sorry, Sonica.

48:27.800 --> 48:30.120
I asked sir to lie
and call you here.

48:38.400 --> 48:39.519
What is the matter with you?

48:40.960 --> 48:44.240
You don't answer my calls,
or reply my messages.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.199
No email, nothing.

48:47.599 --> 48:48.960
What have I done?

48:50.800 --> 48:53.000
What are you punishing
me so harshly for?

48:53.480 --> 48:55.639
Akshay, please leave my hand.

48:56.159 --> 48:57.239
Let me go.

48:57.639 --> 48:59.239
I will,
but first answer my question.

49:00.480 --> 49:02.240
Akshay, I said leave my hand.

49:02.320 --> 49:03.280
I will.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.719
But first tell me what's going on.

49:06.639 --> 49:07.799
Akshay, leave my hand.

49:07.920 --> 49:09.039
First tell me.

49:09.199 --> 49:11.759
You really want to know,
then listen...

49:12.559 --> 49:14.320
Have you heard about Mandar Mhatre?

49:15.800 --> 49:17.240
I am his mistress.

49:17.800 --> 49:19.320
His bloody mistress.

49:21.360 --> 49:23.039
He owns me, Akshay.

49:24.880 --> 49:27.320
He controls my every breath.

49:27.920 --> 49:31.200
I do as he says.
I'm a puppet in his hands.

49:34.039 --> 49:37.039
He's snatched my right to live.

49:38.159 --> 49:39.679
The right to dream.

49:39.800 --> 49:41.600
The right to love anyone.

49:41.960 --> 49:46.039
And if you enter my life,
then he will kill you too.

49:48.840 --> 49:52.320
I want to stay away
and save your life...

49:52.400 --> 49:53.960
...why don't you f**** understand.

49:57.039 --> 49:59.039
Please stay away from me, Akshay...

49:59.119 --> 50:00.839
...otherwise he will kill you.

50:03.760 --> 50:04.720
Please!

50:14.639 --> 50:17.599
Is that all?

50:21.599 --> 50:22.440
Oh God, Sonica.

50:22.519 --> 50:23.880
You had me scared.

50:24.440 --> 50:25.960
I thought it was something serious.

50:30.800 --> 50:32.360
Akshay, this is not a joke.

50:32.519 --> 50:34.519
You're the one humiliating our love.

50:35.840 --> 50:37.840
I didn't fall in love to part ways.

50:39.119 --> 50:42.000
And we can't stop living
fearing death, Sonica.

50:42.239 --> 50:43.479
How will we live?

50:44.280 --> 50:46.360
The entire city's scared of him.

50:46.599 --> 50:47.759
Then we won't live in this city.

50:48.159 --> 50:50.199
Mandar Mhatre rules this city,
doesn't he?

50:50.599 --> 50:51.880
Not the entire world.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.360
We'll disappear to a
place he'll never find us.

50:56.039 --> 50:57.320
This is stupidity.

50:58.159 --> 50:59.559
This isn't possible, Akshay.

51:00.440 --> 51:01.800
Please stop dreaming.

51:01.920 --> 51:03.760
We've the right to dream...

51:05.559 --> 51:08.480
...and you've the right to love.

51:08.559 --> 51:09.639
Akshay...

51:35.639 --> 51:41.079
"I in love with you all over again."

51:41.159 --> 51:46.759
"I in love with you all over again."

51:47.039 --> 51:51.800
"It's immense and immeasurable."

51:51.920 --> 51:57.159
"I in love with you all over again."

51:57.280 --> 52:02.840
"I in love with you all over again."

52:03.079 --> 52:07.639
"It's immense and immeasurable."

52:29.800 --> 52:34.200
"I want to break
freely in your arms."

52:34.320 --> 52:39.400
"Like a leaf falls carelessly."

52:40.559 --> 52:45.320
"I want to shatter and
be one again in your arms."

52:45.960 --> 52:49.559
"You took everything I had."

52:50.320 --> 53:01.200
"I felt no worries
or shame or care."

53:01.920 --> 53:06.720
"I've a desire to see you again."

53:07.280 --> 53:12.240
"I've a desire to see you again."

53:12.760 --> 53:17.320
"It's immense and immeasurable."

53:17.599 --> 53:22.880
"I in love with you all over again."

53:23.000 --> 53:28.440
"I in love with you all over again."

53:28.800 --> 53:33.600
"It's immense and immeasurable."

53:59.639 --> 54:04.920
"You're the reason I'm carefree."

54:05.039 --> 54:09.480
"You're my evening prayer."

54:10.320 --> 54:15.640
"You're unimportant...you're
essential."

54:15.760 --> 54:20.400
"You're my will...you're
my weakness."

54:21.400 --> 54:25.400
"And you're the anxiety..."

54:25.480 --> 54:32.119
"...which these events
brought to me."

54:33.000 --> 54:37.960
"You've finally
expressed your feelings."

54:38.440 --> 54:43.280
"You've finally
expressed your feelings."

54:43.800 --> 54:48.600
"It's immense and immeasurable."

54:48.719 --> 54:53.759
"I in love with you all over again."

54:54.039 --> 54:59.320
"I in love with you all over again."

54:59.679 --> 55:04.639
"It's immense and immeasurable."

55:04.760 --> 55:10.040
"I in love with you all over again."

55:10.119 --> 55:15.480
"I in love with you all over again."

55:15.960 --> 55:20.360
"It's immense and immeasurable."

55:20.559 --> 55:22.480
Breakfast in bed for my queen.

55:22.679 --> 55:24.159
So much love?

55:26.039 --> 55:27.320
Is it a dream or reality?

55:30.599 --> 55:31.559
50-50.

55:35.199 --> 55:36.039
Ready?

55:50.000 --> 55:53.280
I'm trying to turn
this dream into reality.

55:54.800 --> 55:55.880
Do I have your permission?

55:58.639 --> 55:59.639
You do.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.239
It's my will...

56:05.119 --> 56:06.279
...and desire.

56:25.840 --> 56:28.480
M...Mandar...you?

56:31.280 --> 56:33.640
A prisoner's desire to escape...

56:34.880 --> 56:37.960
...and a w**** desire
to get married...

56:39.239 --> 56:41.000
...does surface someday.

56:43.519 --> 56:44.880
Father used to say.

56:48.920 --> 56:49.680
Let go.

56:49.760 --> 56:50.560
Let him go.

56:50.679 --> 56:52.159
Let go. - Let him go.

56:52.440 --> 56:53.400
Let go.

56:55.559 --> 56:56.799
Mandar, please.

56:57.000 --> 56:57.960
Mandar, please.

56:58.079 --> 56:59.559
Mandar, I'll go with you.

56:59.679 --> 57:00.919
Please let him go.

57:01.039 --> 57:02.199
Mandar, please let Akshay go.

57:02.280 --> 57:03.880
I'll go with you.

57:07.239 --> 57:08.719
You eloped with her, didn't you?

57:09.880 --> 57:15.519
Teach him a lesson
so can't even walk again.

57:15.960 --> 57:20.679
Mandar, call off your men
and face me like a man if you can.

57:21.840 --> 57:23.760
I've no interest in proving my guts.

57:24.280 --> 57:25.440
I'm better the way I am.

57:26.199 --> 57:27.319
Akshay.

57:27.599 --> 57:28.279
Akshay!

57:29.159 --> 57:30.799
Akshay! - Break his legs.

57:31.239 --> 57:33.000
Please let him go. - Sonica.

57:33.079 --> 57:34.519
Please let him go.

57:34.679 --> 57:35.679
Please.

57:35.840 --> 57:37.079
Sonica.

57:39.760 --> 57:41.360
Dont speak too much.

57:42.360 --> 57:45.640
Listen to his painful screams.
- Sonica.

57:46.840 --> 57:50.880
Because after today you
will never hear his voice again.

57:56.960 --> 57:58.000
Hit him.

58:31.079 --> 58:32.159
Akshay.

58:35.119 --> 58:39.599
I told you...forgiving
and forgetting...

58:40.519 --> 58:42.840
...doesn't exist in
Mandar Mhatre's dictionary.

58:43.920 --> 58:44.880
Akshay.

58:45.119 --> 58:46.639
Please let him go.

58:47.599 --> 58:48.559
Please let him go.

58:48.960 --> 58:51.760
Please let him go.

58:57.679 --> 58:59.000
Akshay.

59:02.519 --> 59:04.280
Akshay.

59:11.639 --> 59:12.480
Mandar, please.

59:12.679 --> 59:13.679
Mandar please, don't do this.

59:13.760 --> 59:15.360
Save him please.

59:15.639 --> 59:17.079
I beg you.

59:17.320 --> 59:20.840
I beg you, please let him go.

59:21.039 --> 59:23.400
He will die.

59:23.719 --> 59:26.799
Mandar please, save him.

59:29.559 --> 59:30.559
Save him.

59:30.679 --> 59:32.839
Please save him,
otherwise he'll die.

59:32.920 --> 59:34.720
Please save him.

59:34.960 --> 59:35.920
Uncle.

59:36.199 --> 59:37.000
Uncle.

59:37.079 --> 59:38.920
Uncle, save him please.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.079
Why don't you save him?

59:41.159 --> 59:42.519
He will die.

59:42.719 --> 59:44.519
I beg you.

59:45.400 --> 59:46.599
Please save him.

59:46.960 --> 59:48.920
Please save him.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.039
Please.

59:56.119 --> 59:57.319
Just stand here quietly.

59:58.639 --> 59:59.359
Quiet!

01:00:13.559 --> 01:00:14.400
Quiet!

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.599
Hey, just stand here quietly.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.120
I will miss you.

01:00:34.639 --> 01:00:35.960
I tried to explain you.

01:00:37.119 --> 01:00:41.880
If you take my breath
I will take away yours.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:44.920
You didn't understand?

01:02:01.599 --> 01:02:03.159
What the...

01:02:04.519 --> 01:02:05.920
Hey, you...

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.320
Come out.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.000
Come out.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:11.440
Come out.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.800
Come out.

01:02:14.119 --> 01:02:15.079
Come out.

01:02:15.559 --> 01:02:16.440
Open it.

01:02:31.079 --> 01:02:31.960
You!

01:02:37.239 --> 01:02:40.319
In post mortem, your death
will look like a heart attack.

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:46.480
But if you reach the
hospital in 3 minutes...

01:02:47.679 --> 01:02:48.759
...you might survive.

01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:05.880
Give my message to the Reaper.

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:10.240
Tell him, you're just the sample.

01:03:13.639 --> 01:03:15.239
I'll be sending four more.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.160
'Akshay...'

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.639
'Akshay...'

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.560
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:04:58.639 --> 01:05:00.279
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.000
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:05:02.119 --> 01:05:03.920
Glory to...
Mandar Mhatre. - Welcome.

01:05:04.039 --> 01:05:05.759
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.920
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:08.920
Welcome.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.159
Welcome, Mandar sir!

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:11.439
Heartiest welcome.

01:05:11.519 --> 01:05:13.079
Welcome.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.400
Hello, sir.

01:05:14.559 --> 01:05:16.000
You've gathered such a big crowd.

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.759
You've all worked so hard.
- We owe it all to you.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:18.880
Come.

01:05:20.119 --> 01:05:21.239
Glory to Mandar Mhatre.

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:23.200
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.400
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.199
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.240
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.920
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.920
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.599
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:05:34.679 --> 01:05:36.599
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:05:36.679 --> 01:05:38.639
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:05:38.719 --> 01:05:40.480
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:05:40.559 --> 01:05:42.559
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:44.799
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.680
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:48.680
Glory to... - Mandar Mhatre.

01:06:11.639 --> 01:06:14.119
"Betrayal on my lips."

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:18.119
"Let's get naughty tonight."

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:21.119
"Stubbornness on my lips."

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:24.480
"Let's get naughty tonight."

01:06:24.559 --> 01:06:27.880
"They trouble in the
middle of the night."

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:31.280
"Make me restless."

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:34.720
"They ask me to come closer."

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.560
"I hope you don't
get touched by my..."

01:06:38.639 --> 01:06:39.400
"Pink Lips."

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.199
"Pink Lips."

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.120
"Pink Lips."

01:06:41.199 --> 01:06:41.919
"Pink Lips."

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:42.760
"Pink Lips."

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:43.600
"Pink Lips."

01:06:43.679 --> 01:06:45.279
"They drive me crazy."

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.120
"Pink Lips."

01:06:46.239 --> 01:06:47.000
"Pink Lips."

01:06:47.079 --> 01:06:47.799
"Pink Lips."

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:48.680
"Pink Lips."

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:49.519
"Pink Lips."

01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:50.199
"Pink Lips."

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:52.039
"I know you want my Pink Lips."

01:07:05.599 --> 01:07:07.279
"Singing hello-hello all the way."

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.160
"Through those baby lips."

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.519
"Always up to mischief."

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.079
"Missing you whole day."

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.720
"Say that you love me."

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.680
"These distances make me crazy."

01:07:19.239 --> 01:07:20.839
"Singing hello-hello all the way."

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.720
"Through those baby lips."

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:25.079
"Always up to mischief."

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.519
"Missing you whole day."

01:07:27.639 --> 01:07:29.159
"Say that you love me."

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:32.320
"These distances make me crazy."

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:37.320
"I desire only for you."

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:40.679
"Come closer, don't delay anymore."

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:44.080
"I desire only for you."

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:47.480
"Come closer, don't delay anymore."

01:07:47.599 --> 01:07:50.839
"These distances make me crazy."

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:54.159
"It makes my breath smolder."

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:57.680
"They ask you to come closer."

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:01.480
"They listen to you, my..."

01:08:01.599 --> 01:08:02.400
"Pink Lips."

01:08:02.519 --> 01:08:03.119
"Pink Lips."

01:08:03.239 --> 01:08:04.039
"Pink Lips."

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:04.880
"Pink Lips."

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:05.760
"Pink Lips."

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:06.599
"Pink Lips."

01:08:06.679 --> 01:08:08.279
"They drive me crazy."

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:09.119
"Pink Lips."

01:08:09.239 --> 01:08:10.000
"Pink Lips."

01:08:10.119 --> 01:08:10.839
"Pink Lips."

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:11.679
"Pink Lips."

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.519
"Pink Lips."

01:08:12.639 --> 01:08:13.199
"Pink Lips."

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:15.200
"I know you want my Pink Lips."

01:08:28.198 --> 01:08:31.519
"The heart yearns in the rain."

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:35.038
"It beats frantically just for you."

01:08:35.158 --> 01:08:38.279
"The heart yearns in the rain."

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:41.759
"It beats frantically just for you."

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:48.479
"As we hold hands,
it awakens my desires."

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:51.880
"They ask me to come closer."

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.800
"I hope they give into you, my..."

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:56.560
"Pink Lips."

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:57.359
"Pink Lips."

01:08:57.439 --> 01:08:58.319
"Pink Lips."

01:08:58.399 --> 01:08:59.118
"Pink Lips."

01:08:59.238 --> 01:09:00.000
"Pink Lips."

01:09:00.118 --> 01:09:00.800
"Pink Lips."

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.479
"They drive me crazy."

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:03.279
"Pink Lips."

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:04.158
"Pink Lips."

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:05.078
"Pink Lips."

01:09:05.158 --> 01:09:05.920
"Pink Lips."

01:09:06.038 --> 01:09:06.720
"Pink Lips."

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:07.359
"Pink Lips."

01:09:07.479 --> 01:09:09.198
"I know you want my Pink Lips."

01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:10.880
"Singing hello-hello all the way."

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.118
"Through those baby lips."

01:09:16.038 --> 01:09:17.720
"Missing you whole day."

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.600
"Say that you love me."

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.760
"Pink Lips."

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:29.038
"Pink Lips."

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:30.198
"Pink Lips."

01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:31.639
"Pink Lips."

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.760
"Pink Lips."

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.118
"Pink Lips."

01:09:34.399 --> 01:09:36.479
"They drive me crazy."

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.640
"Pink Lips."

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:38.760
"Pink Lips."

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:39.920
"Pink Lips."

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.560
Bhagat.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:57.560
Sonica.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.440
Sonica, no.

01:10:58.520 --> 01:10:59.920
Sonica, no.

01:11:00.039 --> 01:11:01.039
No.

01:11:01.159 --> 01:11:02.239
No.

01:11:03.199 --> 01:11:05.599
Sonica, no.

01:11:40.039 --> 01:11:41.840
Sonica.

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:45.160
Sonica, no.

01:11:51.079 --> 01:11:52.079
No.

01:11:54.119 --> 01:11:55.800
No.

01:12:25.279 --> 01:12:26.079
Hello!

01:12:26.159 --> 01:12:28.279
Mandar Mhatre,
you always taught me...

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.520
...one should never leave
the game of chess incomplete.

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.320
Someone has to win.

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.159
So I play the pawn.

01:12:41.359 --> 01:12:45.799
B4 to C5...one of your pawn's dead.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.840
You're mistaken, Mandar.

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.360
How can she come out of the grave?

01:12:58.439 --> 01:13:00.759
I cannot forget her
voice so soon, uncle.

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:03.920
She didn't just
get out of the grave...

01:13:05.119 --> 01:13:06.599
...but also killed Goli.

01:13:07.479 --> 01:13:08.359
Now?

01:13:14.399 --> 01:13:15.359
Now...

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:17.640
Nothing.

01:13:19.039 --> 01:13:21.199
Meaning? - I mean we do nothing.

01:13:22.319 --> 01:13:24.759
She'll make her next move.

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.720
She's planning to kill
us...and we wait for her.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
That's nice.

01:13:30.319 --> 01:13:34.159
To kill a rat we don't
run after it, uncle.

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:40.119
The rat automatically
gets trapped in the trap...

01:13:40.199 --> 01:13:41.559
...to suffice it's hunger.

01:13:43.159 --> 01:13:44.119
She'll come.

01:13:45.239 --> 01:13:48.960
She will surely come
to us...to die again.

01:13:49.159 --> 01:13:50.159
Keep an eye... - Okay, sir.

01:13:50.239 --> 01:13:51.159
Okay. - Yes.

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:54.600
Hello.

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.079
I really troubled you a lot...

01:13:56.159 --> 01:13:58.519
...by disappearing from
the hospital, inspector.

01:14:00.479 --> 01:14:01.759
I am really sorry.

01:14:02.079 --> 01:14:02.840
Where are you?

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.800
Forget about me
and listen carefully.

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:12.079
Another murder was committed
the night I was attacked.

01:14:13.079 --> 01:14:14.519
Akshay Bedi.

01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:18.479
There's no FIR in your records.

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:23.720
But I know officers like you...

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.560
...only need information, not FIR.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.319
What do you want to say?

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.800
Akshay's dead body
is still in the car.

01:14:34.399 --> 01:14:36.920
And the car's...in Ambolin lake.

01:15:01.039 --> 01:15:03.439
Sir, there are two bags in the car.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:05.320
One contained male
and female clothes.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.079
And we found this from the other.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.760
"13th Jun, 2010."

01:15:21.199 --> 01:15:23.920
"He didn't allow me to
attend photography class again."

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.960
"Coming to him was once my need."

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:31.000
"But now I am lost
in front of his needs."

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:33.119
"Everything belongs to him."

01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:36.479
"The house, the furniture,
the curtains, bedroom."

01:15:37.399 --> 01:15:38.399
"And me?"

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:42.720
"I'm a body adorned
in this prison called home."

01:15:43.399 --> 01:15:45.239
"He's appointed another
bodyguard today..."

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:46.960
"...to keep an eye on him."

01:15:47.399 --> 01:15:49.000
"So that I can't go anywhere."

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:52.440
"If I had even tried,
he would've killed me."

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:56.360
"He's neither letting
me live nor die."

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.640
"He controls everything."

01:15:59.479 --> 01:16:02.239
"My body, my mind, my spirit.'

01:16:02.479 --> 01:16:04.000
"He rules Mumbai."

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:06.840
"I've no way to escape him."

01:16:07.279 --> 01:16:08.679
"The entire city's scared of him."

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:09.880
"Where can I go?"

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.079
"I've no one in this
world except for my grandma."

01:16:13.199 --> 01:16:15.720
"Mandar Mhatre is a dangerous man."

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:17.279
"No one can stop him."

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:18.800
"I am doomed."

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:22.039
"For the first time
I can see a ray of light."

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:23.479
"In the form of Akshay."

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.280
"He gave me a collage today."

01:16:25.399 --> 01:16:26.639
"He loves me."

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.399
"And maybe, for a moment
I've put everything behind me..."

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.240
"...and fallen for him."

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.480
"We've decided to elope."

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.039
"We'll go to Goa forever."

01:16:36.279 --> 01:16:38.800
"Far away from Mandar
Mhatre's world."

01:16:39.079 --> 01:16:40.760
"We'll settle our own small world."

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.600
"Our own."

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.119
"I am finally free
of Mandar Mhatre."

01:16:45.319 --> 01:16:47.840
"It feels my lifetime
imprisonment..."

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:49.600
"...has finally ended."

01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:52.359
"I am so happy."

01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:55.960
You want me to go to
Mandar Mhatre's house...

01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:00.480
...on the basis of these papers,
and arrest him?

01:17:03.399 --> 01:17:05.879
Do you have any idea
who Mandar Mhatre is?

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:09.000
Along with his arrest warrant...

01:17:09.119 --> 01:17:10.399
...my death warrant
will be issued as well.

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:12.079
And if I manage to escape alive...

01:17:12.159 --> 01:17:13.920
...then people will
kill me on the streets.

01:17:15.399 --> 01:17:16.399
Sorry, sir.

01:17:17.239 --> 01:17:20.279
But I've always had his
respects for Mumbai Police.

01:17:21.399 --> 01:17:24.159
I know you'll face few
difficulties solving this case.

01:17:24.399 --> 01:17:27.479
But I also know that you
won't step back from your duty.

01:17:28.399 --> 01:17:29.399
As far as evidence is concerned...

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.000
...it's not just this diary...

01:17:31.359 --> 01:17:33.199
...we also found Akshay
Bedi's dead body.

01:17:41.039 --> 01:17:42.479
I did make a mistake.

01:17:44.479 --> 01:17:45.919
I wanted to kill both of them.

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.199
But the girl escaped.

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:49.920
I did make a mistake.

01:17:51.279 --> 01:17:53.800
But I don't understand
how she escaped?

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:56.720
She didn't just escape,
Mhatre sir...

01:17:57.159 --> 01:17:58.479
...in fact,
she's taking absurd measures...

01:17:58.560 --> 01:17:59.920
...to implicate you.

01:18:00.319 --> 01:18:03.159
She's the one who called
the inspector in Goa...

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:04.679
...and told him about
Akshay's dead body.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.439
Can the dead body testify?

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:09.840
No.

01:18:10.079 --> 01:18:11.479
Is the girl here to testify?

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:12.520
No.

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:14.039
So what's the problem?

01:18:14.399 --> 01:18:15.679
That inspector's the problem.

01:18:16.119 --> 01:18:17.319
He's very smart.

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:20.039
He has the girl's handwritten diary.

01:18:20.239 --> 01:18:21.479
And I am quite sure...

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:25.119
...he must have made some
report regarding the dead body.

01:18:25.399 --> 01:18:28.559
Will Mandar Mhatre
have to teach you...

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:30.960
...how one officer tackles another?

01:18:31.319 --> 01:18:33.199
That's fine, but... - Look, Kishore.

01:18:33.399 --> 01:18:34.559
Just tell me one thing.

01:18:35.199 --> 01:18:38.039
Are you here to help
or add to my problems?

01:18:38.159 --> 01:18:39.920
What are you saying, Mhatre sir?

01:18:40.039 --> 01:18:41.439
Don't worry at all.

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:43.079
I'll handle everything.

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:46.800
I've learnt some
politics in your company.

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:52.240
In today's breaking news,
I would like to tell you...

01:18:52.359 --> 01:18:55.799
...about innocent
and naÃ¯ve looking...

01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:57.440
...Mumbai resident, Sonica Prasad.

01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:01.119
Yes, Sonica Prasad trapped...

01:19:01.239 --> 01:19:02.920
...Akshay Bedi in her fake love.

01:19:03.039 --> 01:19:06.479
She went to Goa with
him and murdered him.

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.560
Akshay Bedi came to Mumbai...

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:13.280
...to pursue a career
in Fashion photographer.

01:19:13.399 --> 01:19:16.759
And they met at Professor
Bajaj's Academy.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.000
Uncle, isn't she the same girl?

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:23.000
Your niece, Sonica Prasad.

01:19:23.119 --> 01:19:24.559
The one I met at the book launch.

01:19:27.279 --> 01:19:29.479
She isn't my real niece.

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.560
Everyone calls me uncle.

01:19:34.119 --> 01:19:36.319
So I call them niece or nephew.

01:19:39.479 --> 01:19:41.399
Gushed out of Hardwaar
and locked horns with Mandar.

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:44.640
Locked horns with Mandar.

01:19:46.199 --> 01:19:47.479
Locked horns with Mandar.

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:53.560
Poor thing washed all my sins...

01:19:54.399 --> 01:19:56.000
...and got tainted herself.

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:01.400
Mandar.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:04.000
Sonica's grandma is here.

01:20:05.359 --> 01:20:07.559
Along with few ward
boys from the old age home.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.800
Uncle, now we have a piece
of cheese to catch the rat.

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:19.880
Grandma.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.319
Grandma. Grandma.

01:20:23.359 --> 01:20:25.759
Sir...- Why did
you take the trouble?

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:28.080
You could've sent a word,
I would've come.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:30.880
Sit, sit.

01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:33.200
You could've called,
I would've come.

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:36.159
Save my Soni, sir.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Soni can never do such a thing.

01:20:39.319 --> 01:20:41.159
He can never do this.

01:20:41.359 --> 01:20:44.079
The police are
definitely mistaken.

01:20:44.399 --> 01:20:47.519
When my son and daughter-in-law
died in an accident...

01:20:48.159 --> 01:20:50.199
...you supported her.

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.680
You're her guardian.

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:56.120
I trust you completely...

01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:59.400
...that you will
save Soni somehow.

01:21:08.279 --> 01:21:10.479
I tried explaining her.

01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:12.640
Don't mingle
with this useless boy.

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:15.600
But no,
she eloped with him. - Come.

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:17.720
Forgive her, sir.

01:21:18.239 --> 01:21:19.119
What are you doing?

01:21:19.439 --> 01:21:20.439
You're elder to me.

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:22.760
This way you'll
make me a sinner.

01:21:23.279 --> 01:21:26.039
Come on,
let's forget what happened.

01:21:26.359 --> 01:21:28.239
Bring her to him.

01:21:28.439 --> 01:21:28.919
Try to explain her...

01:21:29.039 --> 01:21:30.079
...that if she
stays underground...

01:21:30.159 --> 01:21:32.319
...the police
will be against her.

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:36.120
Once she's here, I'll
get her out of this mess somehow.

01:21:37.039 --> 01:21:37.600
Come, Grandma.

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:41.280
Before she left
she gave me a phone number.

01:21:48.119 --> 01:21:52.239
You see...she'll be scared
to see all of you. - I see.

01:21:52.399 --> 01:21:53.960
You stay here. - Yes.

01:21:54.399 --> 01:21:56.519
I'll bring her out.
- You go get her.

01:22:02.079 --> 01:22:03.199
I'll be right back.

01:22:07.359 --> 01:22:09.279
Sonika. - Grandma...

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.199
How are you, my child?

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:13.240
What has happened?

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:15.640
What is everyone saying about you.

01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:19.079
Grandma, sit down.
Let me explain you everything.

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.720
What will you explain your grandma?

01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:25.680
Come. Come with me to Mandar.

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.159
He will handle everything.

01:22:27.279 --> 01:22:29.159
I have talked to him.

01:22:29.279 --> 01:22:30.840
Come on... - No, grandma.

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.840
He will never understand.

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:35.520
What do you think?
Didn't I think about it?

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.440
Come on. Come on, dear.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:05.119
You guys locked
Akshay in the car...

01:23:05.479 --> 01:23:08.119
...and threw him in the lake.

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:13.880
He couldn't
breathe without oxygen.

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:17.560
He suffocated.

01:23:19.479 --> 01:23:21.239
I don't have a lake.

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:27.760
But I'll suffocate you as well.

01:23:52.039 --> 01:23:53.159
Come.

01:24:29.119 --> 01:24:30.359
You...

01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:37.280
Go out. - Yes, sir!

01:24:43.319 --> 01:24:44.159
It's her.

01:24:45.039 --> 01:24:46.199
She's done it.

01:24:48.079 --> 01:24:50.720
Election's around the corner.

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.560
The media shouldn't
get a whiff of this.

01:24:54.399 --> 01:24:55.439
Close the file.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.240
Is it genuine? - 100%.

01:25:13.319 --> 01:25:15.079
I got it directly
from the Police Station.

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.000
Okay. Thank you.

01:25:34.399 --> 01:25:35.479
I read it.

01:25:37.199 --> 01:25:38.479
Look, I'm really very sorry.

01:25:39.359 --> 01:25:41.399
I did a story
on you considering...

01:25:41.479 --> 01:25:43.119
...you were Akshay
Bedi's murderer.

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.320
But think about it once again.

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:48.320
If I do this story,
then we're the press...

01:25:48.439 --> 01:25:50.079
...no one can harm us.

01:25:51.119 --> 01:25:53.119
But you'll need protection.

01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:57.920
Mandar Mhatre will
need protection, not me.

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.279
I am ready to die.

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:03.320
Not him.

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:05.520
We've learned
from trusted sources...

01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:07.760
...that Sonica
is trying to escape...

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:10.520
...from Mandar Mhatre,
a politician from Vishwa Mahasang...

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:12.120
...and not the police.

01:26:12.199 --> 01:26:14.159
We've got our hands
on certain evidence...

01:26:14.399 --> 01:26:16.879
...which proves
that Mandar Mhatre...

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.840
...forcefully made Sonica
his mistress for 3 years.

01:26:22.399 --> 01:26:26.479
Sonica's handwritten
diary proves...

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:28.600
...that she loved Akshay Bedi...

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:30.760
...and was planning
to elope with him.

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:32.880
We'd like to show
you some photographs...

01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:35.079
...which Sonica Prasad
took in her home...

01:26:35.199 --> 01:26:36.960
...in the last 3 years.

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:41.120
Let me remind you,
that Goa Police...

01:26:41.199 --> 01:26:43.319
...has found Akshay
Bedi's dead body.

01:26:43.399 --> 01:26:45.159
And considering
all the evidences...

01:26:45.279 --> 01:26:48.479
...it'll be wrong to
say that only Sonica Prasad...

01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:51.039
...is behind Akshay's murder.

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:52.640
Mandar... - Move!

01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:56.560
How did they get the diary?

01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:57.640
How did they get the diary?

01:27:00.439 --> 01:27:01.319
Move.

01:27:03.079 --> 01:27:04.119
Mandar...

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:07.159
When?
When did she write a diary?

01:27:07.359 --> 01:27:08.319
Where did this diary come from?

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:21.840
Must be the press.

01:27:22.479 --> 01:27:23.119
Tell them no comments.

01:27:23.319 --> 01:27:24.119
No comments.

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.800
I don't want to talk to anyone.

01:27:27.359 --> 01:27:28.079
Who is it?

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:29.520
What?

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:33.119
Yes. Yes.

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:34.720
He's right here.

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:36.840
Call from Delhi.

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:38.800
Call from Delhi.

01:27:42.319 --> 01:27:43.199
What?

01:27:44.479 --> 01:27:45.279
What do I say?

01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:58.800
Yes, ma'am.

01:28:00.119 --> 01:28:00.920
No...

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:06.279
It's just a ruse
of the opposition.

01:28:08.159 --> 01:28:12.119
And photos can be edited
on a computer these days.

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:16.000
Yes...yes, ma'am...

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:20.000
I'll handle everything...

01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:22.000
Yes...

01:28:22.119 --> 01:28:23.199
No problem.

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:26.840
Yes...ma'am.

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:43.399
Hello.

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.600
Mandar Mhatre's
political rival...

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:48.520
...and cousin,
Atul Mhatre wants to meet you.

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:50.760
When do we meet?

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:30.280
Sorry, sorry, Sonica.

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.840
This is more of a filmy
smuggler type meeting, but...

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:34.760
You can't meet me publicly.

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:36.600
Correct.

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:37.840
You're smart.

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:43.039
So...why did you want to meet me?

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.800
Your sorrows have made
me really sad, Sonica.

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.800
No need for an election speech.

01:29:56.119 --> 01:29:57.479
Talk clearly.

01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:02.280
Listen, Sonica.
Mandar's wronged you and me too.

01:30:03.039 --> 01:30:04.560
You want revenge...

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:07.440
...and I want to defeat
him in the next election.

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:10.159
Our motives are connected.

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:13.640
I know the police
are looking for you.

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:19.560
But...I want to organize
a big private press conference...

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.320
...where all the reporters from...

01:30:21.399 --> 01:30:22.719
...all the big channels
will be present.

01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:24.480
Your whereabouts,
the interview's location...

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:26.240
...will remain confidential.

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:28.000
All I want...

01:30:28.119 --> 01:30:30.479
I just want you to
come before the media...

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:33.320
...and shatter Mandar's image.

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:38.279
Just add spice to everything
that reporter said with your tears.

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:41.280
I'll handle the rest.

01:30:47.279 --> 01:30:48.759
That's only about your interest.

01:30:56.039 --> 01:31:00.439
Sonica, just start
helping me first, and then...

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.720
...as soon as I
win the elections, I will...

01:31:03.319 --> 01:31:05.119
Again the election speech.

01:31:07.159 --> 01:31:08.439
I get it.

01:31:09.119 --> 01:31:10.599
Name your price.

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:14.159
You'll have the entire money
in advance before the sun sets.

01:31:15.239 --> 01:31:17.920
I do want an advance, Mr. Atul.

01:31:20.319 --> 01:31:23.239
But it's not money.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.319
I see. Then what is it?

01:31:31.479 --> 01:31:32.439
Kaka Bhonsle.

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:34.760
Alive.

01:31:38.479 --> 01:31:40.279
Kaka...Bhonsle.

01:31:45.479 --> 01:31:46.319
Hello.

01:31:51.359 --> 01:31:52.319
I will be there.

01:31:59.279 --> 01:32:01.479
Welcome...Sonica.

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:06.800
I guess we'll always
be meeting secretly.

01:32:08.479 --> 01:32:11.519
Kaka? - I kept my promise.

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:14.600
Come.

01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:57.000
Father used to say...

01:32:58.239 --> 01:33:01.840
A weakling's intent,
and politician's promise...

01:33:02.479 --> 01:33:03.839
...are meant to break.

01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:06.119
You must have heard that saying.

01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:09.079
Birds of a
feather...flock together.

01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:12.880
In this case, politicians
of a feather...flock together.

01:33:16.319 --> 01:33:17.079
How are you, Atul?

01:33:17.159 --> 01:33:18.399
Your blessings, brother.

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:21.640
Sonica, I am so sorry.

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:25.199
Brother made me an
offer I couldn't refuse.

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:28.039
We're sharing
seat in the election.

01:33:28.159 --> 01:33:29.800
End of all conflicts.

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:38.080
Now that we
brothers are together...

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:39.880
...I don't need uncle.

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:45.400
But you shouldn't
have killed him.

01:33:59.239 --> 01:34:03.840
See...you forcefully
barged in his farmhouse.

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:10.560
And gravely injured the
watchman and his bodyguard.

01:34:30.079 --> 01:34:31.800
Get up.

01:34:34.399 --> 01:34:37.960
Uncle and you
had quite a scuffle.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:40.280
Uncle hurled
you onto this table.

01:34:40.399 --> 01:34:43.639
You got up and hurled
uncle on the dining table.

01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:45.640
Like this.

01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:00.760
Then...somehow you
got hold of the gun...

01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:05.080
...and you shot uncle.

01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:16.000
Don't worry, it's empty now.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:28.199
She killed uncle,
but she was so gravely injured...

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:30.880
...that she couldn't escape.

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.160
Poor soul seeking retribution...

01:35:35.119 --> 01:35:36.760
...was on the verge of dying.

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:41.200
Check and mate.

01:36:27.199 --> 01:36:34.720
"My heart keeps asking me..."

01:36:35.199 --> 01:36:40.760
"...why do I love you so much?"

01:36:43.199 --> 01:36:45.960
"Why are your desires..."

01:36:46.239 --> 01:36:50.279
"...more important
than every wish."

01:36:51.199 --> 01:36:56.800
"I keep uttering
only your name."

01:36:59.239 --> 01:37:06.719
"Why am I obsessed
to be your companion?"

01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:10.960
"Why do I want to
drink your tears..."

01:37:11.079 --> 01:37:15.399
"...and comfort you?"

01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:22.280
"I want to love you every day,
wait for you."

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:30.760
"I want to keep
you safe in my arms."

01:38:03.319 --> 01:38:04.159
Get up.

01:38:06.439 --> 01:38:07.399
Get up, girl.

01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:09.279
What are you staring at? Get up.

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:10.640
Get up.

01:38:11.439 --> 01:38:13.239
Get up you ham!

01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:26.160
Here, sign it.

01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:35.800
What is it?

01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:41.239
It states that you killed Goli,
Babu and Kaka Bhonsle.

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:43.760
You tried to implicate
Mandar Mhatre...

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:46.880
...on the basis of fake
diary and photographs.

01:38:47.359 --> 01:38:49.439
It's your statement, sign it.

01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:23.480
Sign it.
It will save you the trouble.

01:39:34.399 --> 01:39:35.719
Let her lie there.

01:39:36.359 --> 01:39:38.279
Hunger and thirst
will set her straight.

01:39:59.319 --> 01:40:06.599
"I keep mentioning
about you all the time."

01:40:07.239 --> 01:40:12.920
"That's the effect
you've had on me."

01:40:15.279 --> 01:40:22.960
"I want no advice."

01:40:23.319 --> 01:40:28.960
"Because my soul's chosen you."

01:40:31.279 --> 01:40:38.759
"Why am I obsessed
to be your companion?"

01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:42.960
"Why do I want to
drink your tears..."

01:40:43.079 --> 01:40:47.279
"...and comfort you?"

01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:55.160
"I want to love you every day,
wait for you."

01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:02.800
"I want to keep
you safe in my arms."

01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:27.600
"The heart's
worried for no reason."

01:41:28.079 --> 01:41:35.199
"Someone try to explain it."

01:41:36.079 --> 01:41:43.559
"Destroyed in love,
that's the tradition."

01:41:44.399 --> 01:41:51.079
"The one that's patient,
is not love."

01:41:51.399 --> 01:41:55.519
"Try to understand my heart..."

01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:58.800
"...what's this all about."

01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:07.520
"Why am I obsessed
to be your companion?"

01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:11.159
"Why do I want to
drink your tears..."

01:42:11.239 --> 01:42:15.599
"...and comfort you?"

01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:23.560
"I want to love you every day,
wait for you."

01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:31.039
"I want to keep
you safe in my arms."

01:42:47.399 --> 01:42:49.639
We would've pounded
her until she agreed.

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:54.960
If you think she will
listen to you, then you can try.

01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:09.920
One of the people that
you killed was my officer.

01:43:11.359 --> 01:43:15.359
Your officer tried
to kill me in the hospital.

01:43:17.399 --> 01:43:20.239
And the other
three killed Akshay.

01:43:21.119 --> 01:43:23.119
My only regret is that...

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:27.720
...their boss
Mandar Mhatre's alive.

01:43:28.279 --> 01:43:30.840
I know you want to
avenge Akshay's death.

01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:34.159
But that's not your job,
but the law's.

01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:39.840
The same law which the
ACP and Mandar toys around with.

01:43:40.479 --> 01:43:41.759
That's not true.

01:43:42.359 --> 01:43:43.199
Trust me.

01:43:44.399 --> 01:43:45.119
Fine.

01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:48.279
I trust you.

01:43:49.319 --> 01:43:51.319
I'll sign on this statement.

01:43:52.319 --> 01:43:54.479
But just promise me one thing.

01:43:57.600 --> 01:43:59.880
You will arrest Mandar Mhatre.

01:44:06.479 --> 01:44:11.039
Tell me...can you
arrest Mandar Mhatre?

01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:18.160
Will your law
punish Mandar Mhatre...

01:44:20.039 --> 01:44:24.159
...for Akshay's murder
and attempt to murder me.

01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:36.720
Come on.

01:44:37.079 --> 01:44:38.000
Come on.

01:44:39.199 --> 01:44:40.559
Move I say.

01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:46.039
Lower your guns or
I'll blow his brains out.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.359
Put down your guns I said.

01:44:48.439 --> 01:44:49.519
Nobody will shoot.

01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:51.039
Lower your guns.

01:44:53.279 --> 01:44:54.159
Come on.

01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:55.960
Open the door.

01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:58.200
Where's your jeep?

01:44:58.399 --> 01:45:00.039
Where's your jeep? Get your car.

01:45:00.359 --> 01:45:01.359
Stop.

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:02.800
Give me the car keys.

01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:04.159
I said give me the car keys.

01:45:04.399 --> 01:45:05.399
Come on. Get your car.

01:45:05.479 --> 01:45:07.519
Sonica, you cannot escape.

01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:10.200
I am not escaping to live,
but to kill someone.

01:45:10.439 --> 01:45:13.479
Hand me the keys,
otherwise he dies right here.

01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:14.600
Give me the keys.

01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:15.840
Hold your fire. Don't shoot.

01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:16.800
Move back.

01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:18.119
Take the key.

01:45:18.319 --> 01:45:19.399
Take the key.

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:20.760
Give me the keys.

01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:25.440
Open the door, sit inside.

01:45:32.279 --> 01:45:33.359
Come on.

01:45:46.319 --> 01:45:47.840
What? What?

01:45:48.079 --> 01:45:49.199
Watching the fun?

01:45:50.359 --> 01:45:52.639
Go back inside or
I'll break you too.

01:45:53.319 --> 01:45:54.159
Come on.

01:45:56.239 --> 01:45:58.239
Get lost.

01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:10.680
The only mistake we made,
Mandar sir...

01:46:11.319 --> 01:46:13.559
...that we mistook her
for a petty girl, like you did.

01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:17.480
But she's too dangerous,
don't underestimate her.

01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:20.200
A girl that can endure
salt on her wounds...

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:22.640
...can't be scared of more pain.

01:46:23.199 --> 01:46:25.439
Tighten the security around you.

01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:26.520
Scaring me?

01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:28.800
You're trying to scare me?

01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:34.160
I'm just asking you to stay alert.

01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:36.720
And she's already lost
so much in this battle...

01:46:37.079 --> 01:46:39.079
...that she has
nothing more to lose.

01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:41.360
I will kill that witch.

01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:42.640
Kill her.

01:46:43.399 --> 01:46:45.439
You already tried that.

01:46:47.119 --> 01:46:48.720
She was half dead...

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.760
...when you tormented
her boyfriend to death.

01:46:53.399 --> 01:46:55.759
And she should've
been completely dead...

01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:58.239
...when you buried
her alive in the grave.

01:46:59.399 --> 01:47:01.639
She's witnessed death so closely...

01:47:02.439 --> 01:47:04.559
...that she no longer fears death.

01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:07.440
And those who don't fear death...

01:47:08.039 --> 01:47:10.279
...is the most dangerous person.

01:47:11.239 --> 01:47:12.679
Think about what I said, sir.

01:47:13.279 --> 01:47:15.800
And if you need any
help from my department...

01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:17.000
...then give me a call.

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:18.640
See you.

01:47:48.399 --> 01:47:49.679
I'll disappear for two days.

01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:53.159
If they don't find me,
they won't find you.

01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:58.520
Thank you. - You're welcome.

01:47:59.279 --> 01:48:00.239
And...

01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:02.560
Take this.

01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:04.520
What is this?

01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:08.000
Phone number...of someone
who wants to help you.

01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:10.600
He might get you to Mandar as well.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:11.960
Who is he?

01:48:12.079 --> 01:48:14.159
Call him, you'll know.

01:48:18.399 --> 01:48:19.719
Sir, the biggest benefit
of this land is...

01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:21.159
...that it's close to the dam.

01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:23.439
So we'll get an artificial late...

01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:26.120
...and there are poles
close-by for electricity.

01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:30.920
Basically,
sir, we're thinking about...

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:32.079
...three types of accommodation.

01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:33.880
The first is villa.

01:48:34.399 --> 01:48:35.639
Secondly, we can construct wings...

01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:37.600
...and sell flats.

01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:40.760
You see, sir,
these days people prefer flats.

01:48:41.039 --> 01:48:42.920
It lessens the security hassles..

01:48:43.039 --> 01:48:45.519
...and we won't be responsible
for the maintenance either.

01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:47.520
And third are row houses.

01:48:48.119 --> 01:48:50.840
Villa and flats, combined.

01:48:51.159 --> 01:48:52.559
Why is that door open?

01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:57.320
Sir...someone must
have left it ajar.

01:49:06.039 --> 01:49:07.359
Actually sir,
it's the catering people.

01:49:07.439 --> 01:49:08.759
They're getting tea and snacks.

01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:10.600
Close it.

01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:12.359
No one...no one's coming it.

01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:13.680
Close it.

01:49:14.399 --> 01:49:15.879
You can have your tea
and snacks after the meeting.

01:49:16.279 --> 01:49:17.519
Close the door, come on.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:20.880
Snacks...

01:49:27.039 --> 01:49:28.560
So, the land's close to the dam.

01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:29.320
And?

01:49:29.399 --> 01:49:30.759
You two don't move an inch.
- Okay sir.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.319
There's an interview in
progress inside. - Okay.

01:49:32.399 --> 01:49:34.399
Don't let any outsider in.
- Yes, sir.

01:49:39.079 --> 01:49:39.960
Dolly, listen.

01:49:40.319 --> 01:49:41.319
Get sir a glass of water...

01:49:41.399 --> 01:49:43.799
...and tell the makeup man
to be ready in case of sweat.

01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:45.199
Is that clear? - Okay, madam.

01:49:45.319 --> 01:49:46.159
Alright.

01:49:47.359 --> 01:49:49.679
Sir. Since we can
have just one debate...

01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:52.520
...I would like to know
the importance of that diary.

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:55.119
How...how many people
are allowed in the studio?

01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:57.520
During the show?

01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:02.040
There's the EP, Asst.
Director and my Cameraman.

01:50:02.359 --> 01:50:03.599
Do you have security
clearance for everyone?

01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:05.279
Security clearance?

01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:07.680
Yes, sir. Everyone has an ID.

01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:09.000
Anyone can have an ID card.

01:50:09.079 --> 01:50:10.279
This is not right.

01:50:10.399 --> 01:50:11.559
Only these two cameramen stay here.

01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:12.680
No one else comes in or goes out.

01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:14.440
I am very clear on that. Start.

01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:17.159
Okay, Anuradha, you step out...

01:50:17.239 --> 01:50:18.439
...let the cameraman stay in, and...

01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:20.760
...you come in only to give
your cues during the ad breaks.

01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:21.640
Alright?

01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:22.280
Alright?

01:50:22.359 --> 01:50:24.479
Excuse me. Where is she going?

01:50:25.319 --> 01:50:26.840
To the control room, sir.

01:50:27.319 --> 01:50:30.039
How many people in the control room?
- 10 12...

01:50:30.159 --> 01:50:31.559
10 or 12? Please tell me.

01:50:32.319 --> 01:50:33.359
12 I think, sir.

01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:34.720
Do you know their names?

01:50:35.119 --> 01:50:36.599
Why would I know their names?

01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:38.440
They are interns, technical staff...

01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:40.640
If you don't know their names,
then who does?

01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:42.680
This is not safe.

01:50:43.479 --> 01:50:44.639
There's no security here.

01:50:45.119 --> 01:50:46.880
But, sir, this is a news channel.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.840
Why would anyone do anything here?

01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:51.560
Incidents happen where
people least expect it.

01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:52.560
You know that.

01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:53.960
This interview continues at my home.

01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:56.240
I am sorry,
sir, but this is a debate.

01:50:56.319 --> 01:50:57.639
You please can't...

01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:59.119
To hell with your debate.

01:50:59.399 --> 01:51:00.839
But, sir...please, sir.

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:01.680
Sir...

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:28.600
Let's go, sir.

01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:30.720
What are so many people doing here?

01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:33.240
It's the inauguration of a club...

01:51:33.319 --> 01:51:34.479
...there's bound to be people here.

01:51:35.079 --> 01:51:36.519
Let's go home. Come on.

01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:38.400
Sir...what are you doing?

01:51:39.279 --> 01:51:40.599
People are waiting for you.

01:51:41.039 --> 01:51:42.880
I promised the organizer as well.

01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:45.680
In fact, he donated a large
amount for our party fund.

01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:48.320
Do you want to donate
my life for that?

01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:51.760
Tell me...what do you know?

01:51:52.159 --> 01:51:54.119
What do you know? - About what, sir?

01:51:54.399 --> 01:51:55.519
About her.

01:51:56.159 --> 01:51:57.319
She's waiting for me right here.

01:51:57.399 --> 01:51:58.159
You know that, don't you?

01:51:58.279 --> 01:52:00.039
She'll hide in this
crowd and kill me.

01:52:00.119 --> 01:52:01.079
That's your plan, isn't it?

01:52:01.159 --> 01:52:02.920
What are you saying, sir? - Get out.

01:52:03.039 --> 01:52:05.199
Out. Get out you f*** idiot.

01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:06.600
Take me home quickly.

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:08.159
Out! Out!

01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:09.360
Out!

01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:30.920
No...it'll be done.

01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:33.600
I'll do something.

01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:35.520
I'll do something.

01:52:37.239 --> 01:52:40.599
It'll be done...there
will be no problem.

01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:53.000
You're back soon.

01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:56.200
Shall I serve dinner?
- I am not hungry.

01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:00.279
Eat something, just a little...
- I said I'm not hungry.

01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:01.360
Stop blabbering.

01:53:09.199 --> 01:53:12.519
You look tired, I'll get you milk.

01:53:13.439 --> 01:53:14.519
You'll sleep peacefully.

01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:35.880
Who was he talking to?

01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:37.840
Was he...

01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:41.480
I'll call him inside and ask.

01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:42.600
Milk!

01:53:51.199 --> 01:53:52.960
You...

01:53:53.159 --> 01:53:54.079
Looking for your gun?

01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:56.560
I got rid of it.

01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:02.080
Always get rid of
things we don't need...

01:54:02.159 --> 01:54:03.519
...you taught me this.

01:54:06.239 --> 01:54:07.960
Wedding vows don't make you...

01:54:08.279 --> 01:54:11.439
...a virtuous husband Mandar Mhatre.

01:54:14.399 --> 01:54:18.639
If you want to be revered,
then you need to act accordingly.

01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:52.079
Father used to say...

01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:55.320
...affection in eyes of the wife...

01:54:56.560 --> 01:55:01.000
...and weapon in the hand
of the lover, are only for pretence.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.439
Come on, give me the gun.

01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:05.840
Come.

01:55:07.079 --> 01:55:08.880
Let's reshuffle all the pawns...

01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:11.439
...and restart the game.

01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:14.159
Give it. Give me the gun.

01:55:16.359 --> 01:55:17.279
Give me the gun.

01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:52.119
Mad dogs...

01:55:55.119 --> 01:55:56.640
...and crazy elephants...

01:55:59.279 --> 01:56:02.000
...are meant to be shot down.

01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:07.720
I wish your father
had taught you that.

01:56:57.199 --> 01:56:59.039
My parents died when I was a kid.

01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:01.279
My grandma used to live here.

01:57:02.319 --> 01:57:03.759
But after she passed away...

01:57:04.399 --> 01:57:05.559
...this house has remained locked.

01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:08.840
And no one will imagine that...

01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:11.159
...you're hiding in
a police officer's house...

01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:12.760
...who is looking for you.

01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:18.680
Thank you.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.439
Since I became a police officer...

01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:24.159
...this is the first
time I felt I did my duty.

01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:27.920
Anyway, don't step
out of the house too much...

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.720
...and if anyone asks, then
just say you're my sister Veronica.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:34.840
Thank you.

01:57:35.039 --> 01:57:36.039
Take care, Sonica.

01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:37.360
Bye.

01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:45.840
When he came home he looked worried.

01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:52.880
When I asked whether
he'll have dinner, he refused.

01:57:55.039 --> 01:57:58.560
I went to my daughter's
room to tuck her in.

01:58:01.439 --> 01:58:02.439
And that's when...

01:58:04.399 --> 01:58:05.879
That's when I heard the gunfire.

01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:09.800
I ran to her room and...

01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:24.960
You took your revenge.

01:58:27.159 --> 01:58:28.720
Finished your battle against God?

01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:33.320
Sonica, you should
now go to a hospital...

01:58:33.439 --> 01:58:34.879
...and get yourself treated.

01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:40.360
Because...you can't live like this.

01:58:41.159 --> 01:58:42.639
Everyone has to die someday, Akshay.

01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:44.159
Sonica, don't argue.

01:58:47.159 --> 01:58:48.840
Please, don't argue, Akshay.

01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:52.360
If I get myself treated...

01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:55.720
...then I'll stop seeing you.

01:58:57.880 --> 01:58:59.600
If what's the point of living...

01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:03.399
...if I can't see you.

01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:05.520
But, Sonica... - Akshay, please.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:08.439
Stop saying such things.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.520
I'd rather die seeing your face...

01:59:15.279 --> 01:59:16.840
...than live without you.

01:59:19.159 --> 01:59:19.920
Akshay...

01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:24.119
...say those things again.

01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:27.560
Which one?

01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:29.039
About us.

01:59:29.399 --> 01:59:34.559
"I in love with you all over again."

01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:39.960
"I in love with you all over again."

01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:45.360
"It's immense and immeasurable."

01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:50.680
"I in love with you all over again."

01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:56.440
"I in love with you all over again."

01:59:56.760 --> 02:00:01.480
"It's immense and immeasurable."

02:00:23.479 --> 02:00:27.799
"I want to break
freely in your arms."

02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:33.199
"Like a leaf falls carelessly."

02:00:34.399 --> 02:00:39.000
"I want to shatter and
be one again in your arms."

02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:43.120
"You took everything I had."

02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:54.720
"I felt no worries
or shame or care."

02:00:55.560 --> 02:01:00.360
"I've a desire to see you again."

02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:06.159
"I've a desire to see you again."

02:01:06.399 --> 02:01:10.960
"It's immense and immeasurable."

02:01:11.239 --> 02:01:16.359
"I in love with you all over again."

02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:22.200
"I in love with you all over again."

02:01:22.319 --> 02:01:27.159
"It's immense and immeasurable."

02:01:27.279 --> 02:01:32.599
"I in love with you all over again."

02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:38.079
"I in love with you all over again."

02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:43.760
"It's immense and immeasurable."
