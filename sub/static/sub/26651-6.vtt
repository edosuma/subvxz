Winkelmann...

01:04.160 --> 01:06.160
(Soundtrack becomes charged)

01:08.480 --> 01:09.480
Mr. Winkelmann!

01:10.000 --> 01:10.840
Ms. Neid.

01:11.840 --> 01:12.800
No tennis today?

01:12.880 --> 01:13.800
No.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.480
I don't have time for games.

01:15.560 --> 01:16.840
Where's your lovely wife?

01:16.920 --> 01:18.360
Out of the country.

01:18.440 --> 01:19.840
-Her mother is ill.
-Ah.

01:19.920 --> 01:21.320
Sorry to hear it.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.320
How can I help you, Ms. Neid?

01:22.400 --> 01:23.800
(English)  -Lemonade, sir?
-No, thank you.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.960
-And for you?
-Yes, please.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.920
(German)  I have a shipment arriving
from West Germany.

01:30.680 --> 01:33.760
Submarine parts
for Würfel & Struth's Type WS-71.

01:33.840 --> 01:35.000
Torpedo pipes.

01:35.080 --> 01:36.560
Known as "toros".

01:37.840 --> 01:41.720
I need you to arrange a sale
to the South African Defense Force.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.640
Who do you think I am?

01:46.320 --> 01:49.920
Some kind of international arms smuggler?

01:50.840 --> 01:52.760
Don't worry.
I'll take care of the logistics.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.840
I just need you to get the papers.

01:54.920 --> 01:58.960
What if I don't accept
your ludicrous proposition?

01:59.040 --> 02:00.000
(Snorts)

02:02.680 --> 02:04.480
It isn't a proposition,

02:05.240 --> 02:06.240
Mr. Winkelmann.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.240
It's an order.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.760
(Moody, pulsing soundtrack builds)

02:15.720 --> 02:16.800
I'm sure you'd agree

02:16.880 --> 02:19.840
that a photo of the West German
Trade Commissioner to South Africa

02:19.920 --> 02:22.680
meeting with a sales rep
from the military division

02:22.760 --> 02:27.080
of a West German car company
is best kept out of the press.

02:27.160 --> 02:28.640
Or this one

02:29.360 --> 02:31.280
with a high-ranking SADF General?

02:31.800 --> 02:33.240
(Moody, pulsing soundtrack builds)

-Something's come up.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.840
-I need to get back to Tripoli.
-Tariq is making you leave, isn't he?

05:31.240 --> 05:33.480
Because we went out to Ku'damm last night.

05:34.880 --> 05:37.720
I promise we'll never do it again.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.320
You can't just leave in the night
without telling me why or saying goodbye.

05:44.160 --> 05:47.440

Good morning from West Berlin.

06:18.080 --> 06:22.000
Not much remains of Club Paradise,
a popular disco,

06:22.080 --> 06:25.040
after a bomb exploded here
yesterday in the middle of the night.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.920
There are at least three confirmed deaths

06:27.000 --> 06:29.680
and more than 100 people
still in critical condition.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.280
Thank you.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.720
(Hand-held radio, indistinct talking)

06:48.240 --> 06:49.520
(French)  What did he say?

06:49.920 --> 06:53.320
A home-made bomb
brought here in a bag.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.720
And they have no idea who did it.

06:57.760 --> 07:01.600
But the terrorist...
This disco wasn't the target.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.280
-What?
-Come.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.360
(Siren,
minimal, suspenseful soundtrack)

07:12.400 --> 07:13.400
Look.

07:15.800 --> 07:21.080
The Club was a spontaneous decision
because of your little friend Kolibri?

07:24.160 --> 07:28.400
We had every fucking Hotel Voltaire
in Paris staked out for the past 24 hours.

07:29.400 --> 07:34.560
And it turns out your little East German
spy was correct about Hotel Voltaire.

07:35.320 --> 07:36.880
But wrong about the city.

07:37.760 --> 07:41.520
-He's not responsible for this.
-For confusing Paris and Berlin?

07:41.920 --> 07:43.720
Or not responsible for this terror attack?

07:44.560 --> 07:46.000
(Tense, low-pitched pulsing)

07:53.440 --> 07:55.640
No matter what you think.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.320
He's my prime suspect now.

(English)  And we know the East Germans
how should I put it, made it possible.

08:28.600 --> 08:33.160
-We don't know that.
-They aren't harboring terrorists here?

08:34.040 --> 08:35.440
Got Reagan breathing down my neck,

08:35.840 --> 08:38.840
the whole city's on high-alert,
lockdown on all the military bases.

08:39.240 --> 08:42.200
My wife didn't even let the kids
go to school today.

08:42.600 --> 08:45.880
This was a deliberate attack
on US citizens on occupied soil, Jim.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.200
But it's not ours to call. Not yet.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.160
Tell that to the 50 Americans
lying in the hospital right now.

08:51.560 --> 08:54.840
One of our servicemen is dead.
The other's hanging on by a thread.

08:55.240 --> 08:59.960
Gaddifi's a blood-thirsty lunatic.
We have to strike back at Tripoli now.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.480
-You're not serious.
-Serious as a fucking heart attack.

09:02.880 --> 09:03.800
Okay, look.

09:04.200 --> 09:08.720
We've got counter-terrorism experts from
all our NATO allies waiting for us inside.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.080
Just hear them out.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.080
Please.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.640
(Charged atmosphere)

09:15.480 --> 09:18.000
Good morning, everyone.
Thank you for making the trip.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.240
So which one of you was asleep
at the switch?

09:20.600 --> 09:23.600
Because I thought our respective
job descriptions were pretty clear.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.240
You guys track Arab terrorists in Paris,

09:26.640 --> 09:29.400
and I man the final frontier
of the free fuckin' world here in Berlin.

09:29.800 --> 09:33.920
But no. Seems like somebody's drinking
a little too much fuckin' wine over there.

09:34.800 --> 09:38.080
And now your problem
has become my problem.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.240
So tell me everything you know.

09:44.560 --> 09:45.520
(Clicking slides)

09:45.600 --> 09:47.920
This woman is our suspect in question.

09:48.320 --> 09:52.840
Immigration officials confirmed she
arrived in West Berlin yesterday morning.

09:53.240 --> 09:56.040
Then she crossed back and forth into
the East twice before the day was done.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.560
-Who is she?
-We don't know yet.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.760
She's traveling under an Italian alias.

10:01.320 --> 10:04.520
But this photograph was taken here.
In East Berlin.

10:05.320 --> 10:08.560
-At the Libyan Diplomatic Residence.
-I knew it.

10:08.960 --> 10:12.760
-We gotta get this photo out on the wire.
-Where did you get these photographs?

10:12.920 --> 10:14.080
(Unnerving shrill)

10:14.160 --> 10:15.480
From a trusted source.

10:19.720 --> 10:23.960
(German)  Border guards just delivered
this amazing artifact to our office.

10:25.520 --> 10:26.480
-Thank you.
-Mm.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.720
Who is George Lovegrove?

10:29.720 --> 10:31.120
Look closer.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.920
Does anyone want to tell me
what Kolibri is doing in West Berlin,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.360
traveling on a fake British passport?

10:40.400 --> 10:41.480
Can I see that?

10:43.120 --> 10:45.040
Has he been in touch with you?

10:47.640 --> 10:49.720
-No.
-And you, Walter?

10:50.280 --> 10:51.640
Me? No.

10:52.320 --> 10:55.800
Fine.
Inform me immediately if he reaches out.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.320
In the meantime, someone had better
go over and babysit Ingrid Rauch.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.800
(English)
Does anyone recognize this man?

11:06.200 --> 11:10.480
He entered West Berlin by plane from Paris
on a Britisch passport late last night.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.840
-Under the name George Lovegrove.
-Speak of the devil.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.320
In the meantime,
the real George Lovegrove

11:16.720 --> 11:19.800
reported his passport stolen
at Paris-Charles de Gaulle.

11:20.200 --> 11:23.880
So there's one thing we know for certain.
This ain't George Lovegrove.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.880
-Because it's Kolibri.
-Who?

11:26.280 --> 11:29.080
That East German weasel who infiltrated
the Bundeswehr a few years back.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.400
-Code word: Hummingbird.
-No shit.

11:31.800 --> 11:36.160
Top HVA operative most recently seen
in Paris by one of our operatives.

11:36.560 --> 11:39.160
And before that... Libya.

11:39.880 --> 11:40.840
Libya?

11:41.240 --> 11:43.640
-That's a coincidence.
-What?

11:44.960 --> 11:49.280
That Kolibri was in Libya,
or that this man looks like Kolibri?

11:50.320 --> 11:52.840
Actually,
Frau Winkelmann has had the most...

11:53.240 --> 11:56.000
direct exposure
to the famous East German spy.

11:56.360 --> 11:59.600
-Don't exaggerate.
-Perhaps you would be the best to confirm.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.760
-No.
-No?

12:02.160 --> 12:04.000
Sure, I've seen him.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.120
But frankly,
he looks like a lot of people.

12:06.520 --> 12:10.120
-I'm certain he has nothing to do with it.
-Come on, look at him.

12:10.520 --> 12:14.440
You put that out on the wire, they bring
in half the young men in West Berlin.

12:14.840 --> 12:18.480
I suggest Frau Winkelmann
speaks with a composite sketch artist.

12:18.880 --> 12:21.840
If she describes his distinguishing
characteristic in more detail,

12:22.680 --> 12:24.480
it will help us
to pick him out of the crowd.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.480
-I can hardly remember.
-You can try.

12:29.560 --> 12:33.320
-I can help you.
-It's worth a shot, Frau Winkelmann.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.320
-Fine.
-Good.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.400
I think his eyes are blue.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.200
Oh, no, wait.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.640
I'm not sure. Are they brown?

12:47.640 --> 12:49.840
Blue is fine, Brigitte.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.640
Blue is fine.

12:53.800 --> 12:57.000
And he's not tall or... short, he's...

12:57.400 --> 12:58.840
Medium.

12:59.240 --> 13:02.360
-And medium brown hair, too.
-So, that could be... Anyone.

13:02.760 --> 13:04.000
Exactly.

13:04.840 --> 13:08.360
-What about the shape of his face?
-Oval.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.320
His nose moves when he talks.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.160
He has a strong chin. Oval.

13:17.040 --> 13:20.920
And his mouth is thin, but his lips
are full, does that make sense?

13:21.720 --> 13:24.400
-You tell me.
-Yes.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.640
Something like that?

13:32.840 --> 13:34.400
Yes.

13:35.160 --> 13:38.720
(German) Because it wouldn't be safe
for you to be on Ku'damm tonight.

13:39.120 --> 13:42.360
Of course it's not safe.
It's full of Americans!

13:42.440 --> 13:43.560
Stay home.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.080
Read Voltaire.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.760
What? Silly boy...

13:48.880 --> 13:50.240
(Oppressive silence)

13:52.680 --> 13:54.920
Who were you trying to send a message to?

13:57.080 --> 13:57.920
My mother?

13:59.560 --> 14:00.640
I'm serious.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.320
The Americans? The British?

14:04.040 --> 14:06.080
I just told my mother to stay home.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.960
I've been doing that for years.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.400
Day after day.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.320
She's old now.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.040
Developing dementia.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.120
And she wanders.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.040
And climbs over the Wall?

14:34.720 --> 14:35.720
(It's ringing)

14:35.800 --> 14:37.200
Ask her yourself.

14:39.560 --> 14:40.840
(Continues ringing)

14:56.280 --> 14:57.520
Nobody's home.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
That's unusual.

15:00.560 --> 15:01.520
Walter.

15:01.880 --> 15:03.720
Don't play games with me.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.240
(It picks up)

15:11.080 --> 15:11.960
Hello?

15:12.760 --> 15:16.120
Good day, Mrs. Schweppenstette.
It's Marcus Fuchs.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.640
Marcus, what a nice surprise!

15:19.400 --> 15:20.880
Is something wrong with Walter?

15:20.960 --> 15:23.960
No, I just have a few questions.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.720
Did you talk to Walter yesterday?

15:26.360 --> 15:28.760
Of course, he calls me every day.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.040
He's always worried about me,
especially now...

15:33.560 --> 15:35.800
that it is so dangerous.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.600
Dangerous?

15:38.120 --> 15:41.320
Well, since the Americans
went to the moon.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.080
You know.

15:43.800 --> 15:44.960
The moon.

15:45.040 --> 15:49.720
But Walter always says that
Comrade Brezhnev can handle it.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.200
It's just a matter of days

15:52.720 --> 15:54.600
until we walk on the moon, too.

15:54.680 --> 15:57.120
-Thank you, Mrs. Schweppenstette.
-Mm.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.080
And have a nice day.

15:59.160 --> 16:00.000
You too.

16:13.520 --> 16:14.800
(Doorbell rings)

16:18.160 --> 16:19.760
What a wonderful surprise.

16:19.840 --> 16:20.960
Grandma!

16:21.360 --> 16:22.400
(Laughs)

16:22.640 --> 16:25.000
I wasn't expecting you two!

16:25.560 --> 16:26.520
(Child giggles)

16:27.360 --> 16:28.320
Wow.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.880
-Is that for me?
-Yes, it is.

16:31.560 --> 16:32.760
We brought a cake.

16:33.600 --> 16:34.640
Aw.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.960
-I'll make some chocolate milk, then.
-Chocolate!

16:37.040 --> 16:38.960
-Should I?
-Yes, please.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.240
Annett, would you like to have
some coffee or tea?

16:43.720 --> 16:44.760
Coffee, please.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.680
Darling, please be careful.

16:52.640 --> 16:53.800
Do you have guests?

16:54.240 --> 16:55.680
I'm expecting some.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.160
From South Africa.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.000
Ah.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.960
Rose Seithati.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.920
One of Mandela's fighters.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.760
Didn't you know?

17:03.840 --> 17:05.800
Walter asked me to take her in.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.800
(Charged, thrilling soundtrack)

17:10.880 --> 17:12.480
U.S. Mission to East Germany, East Berlin

17:12.560 --> 17:14.440
(English)  Our leaders in exile
are scattered to the four winds.

17:14.840 --> 17:19.960
Mac in London. Tambo in Lagos.
Zuma in Moscow. Everyone is Lusaka.

17:20.360 --> 17:22.200
The boss is on our backs, man.

17:22.600 --> 17:25.360
Phone's bugged, letters open, we're unable
to reach the people we need to reach.

17:25.960 --> 17:28.360
-Here? In South Africa?
-That's right.

17:28.760 --> 17:32.160
And as for Rose. Staying in South Africa
has become impossible.

17:33.520 --> 17:37.560
So she's headed to East Berlin, where
she'll work on a top-secret operation.

17:37.960 --> 17:41.240
A safe channel to connect our whole
inner-circle regardless of where we are.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.560
A new mode of communication
that cannot be tapped or traced.

17:43.960 --> 17:47.080
My East German colleagues
are communication technology specialists.

17:47.480 --> 17:52.680
Rose will work with them to develop
a technique. Then she'll be back...

17:53.080 --> 17:57.160
-to train all of you.
-What will we call the operation?

17:57.560 --> 18:00.160
Vula, which means "open" in Xhosa.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.960
-Operation Vula.
-Power to the people!

18:03.360 --> 18:04.320
Power to us!

18:08.680 --> 18:11.560
(German)  Someday Thandi will live
in a South Africa without Apartheid.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.600
(Crickets, seagulls)

18:15.280 --> 18:17.240
She knows I'm fighting for her future.

18:18.760 --> 18:21.360
I'll do everything to help you
with Operation Vula.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.720
I don't need a babysitter.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.200
I can handle it myself.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.200
I'm not just going to accompany you.

18:29.080 --> 18:32.400
After the disaster in Angola,
I was sure I'd be ordered back.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.520
Instead, I'm getting new orders.
I don't get it, I have to find out why.

18:36.600 --> 18:37.840
Because you're the best.

18:38.120 --> 18:38.960
Ha.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.560
North of the equator.

18:57.320 --> 18:58.520
(Sighs)

18:59.560 --> 19:01.880
It's not easy to say goodbye
to this place.

19:01.960 --> 19:03.120
That's what you say.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.200
You'll be back in two weeks.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.040
Yeah.

19:17.360 --> 19:21.080
Kleinmachnow, East Germany

19:23.000 --> 19:24.120
Ah.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.640
(German)  The girls will be happy.

19:55.320 --> 19:58.040
Thomas sends his love.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.280
And he has a new project.

20:01.920 --> 20:04.440
Oh, you'll love this: a radio show.

20:05.520 --> 20:08.560
He sent instructions
on how to record a story for it.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.000
What story?

20:11.920 --> 20:12.680
Pffft.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.240
Thomas!

20:14.320 --> 20:16.080
We'll all be together soon.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.080
(Light, airy, atmospheric tones)

20:18.240 --> 20:19.600
One step at a time.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.640
(Dramatic, atmospheric pads)

20:45.720 --> 20:47.720
(Melancholy, acoustic build-up)

21:05.960 --> 21:06.800
At school,

21:07.360 --> 21:10.840
when the teachers used to ask
what we wanted to do when we grow up,

21:10.920 --> 21:12.680
I always had the same answer.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.240
I wanted to be a doctor.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.080
(Door buzzes)

21:19.360 --> 21:20.800
(Sounds echo out)

21:23.200 --> 21:24.320
Hello?

21:24.400 --> 21:25.760
Hello. You don't know me.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.040
I'm Marianne
and I'm here instead of Klaus.

21:28.760 --> 21:29.760
What happened to Klaus?

21:30.360 --> 21:33.120
Unfortunately he broke his leg
and can't drive.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.120
That's why I'm here.

21:35.840 --> 21:37.200
Can you show me ID?

21:40.080 --> 21:41.040
Sure.

21:47.600 --> 21:48.520
It rained.

21:49.280 --> 21:50.600
That's good for the flowers.

21:51.760 --> 21:52.760
Come in.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.600
Which church are you affiliated with?

22:00.200 --> 22:02.000
The Passion Church in Schöneberg.

22:02.360 --> 22:03.560
Uh-huh.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.040
I am not with the Stasi.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.080
Here are the packages.

22:09.480 --> 22:11.680
I already gave the Fischers theirs.

22:12.040 --> 22:12.760
(Sighs)

22:12.960 --> 22:14.040
Knötgen,

22:17.840 --> 22:18.800
Kannenberg...

22:22.760 --> 22:24.080
and the Hein family.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.120
-Will you be staying in Kleinmachnow?
-No, unfortunately I won't.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.400
But I'll come again. Or Klaus.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.640
Definitely before Christmas.

22:37.640 --> 22:40.120
Hmm. Can I offer you a cup of tea?

22:40.200 --> 22:41.040
Gladly.

22:41.440 --> 22:42.840
Then have a seat.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.120
Thank you.

22:47.280 --> 22:48.520
(Dog barking)

22:49.360 --> 22:50.760
(Ominous, low-pitched wave)

22:53.240 --> 22:54.720
It's a bit stuffy in here.

22:55.280 --> 22:56.200
Oh...

22:57.600 --> 22:58.400
Coming up!

23:02.880 --> 23:04.640
(Street noise)

23:06.720 --> 23:08.400
(Ominous, low-pitched wave)

23:18.240 --> 23:19.880
Café Wedekind, West Berlin, West Germany

23:19.960 --> 23:21.440
(Soothing background piano)

23:36.440 --> 23:37.720
(Vocal sigh)

23:40.880 --> 23:42.680
(French)  Were you waiting for someone?

23:43.080 --> 23:44.880
What are you doing here?

23:45.280 --> 23:48.800
-This used to be our place.
-That was a long time ago.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.720
Now it's my place.
As you know, my apartment is upstairs.

23:55.240 --> 23:57.920
For old times' sake then, Brigitte?

24:02.920 --> 24:03.960
Well.

24:06.360 --> 24:09.320
Can we stop lying to each other?
For just a moment?

24:09.720 --> 24:11.360
What are you talking about?

24:12.240 --> 24:13.720
You're in love with him?

24:15.240 --> 24:16.360
Of course not.

24:18.240 --> 24:19.800
Stop taking me for a fool, Brigitte.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.840
(German)  What a pleasure to see you,
Mrs. Winkelmann.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.040
Günter.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.440
It's been too long.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.840
That's right.
I was thinking about you in Paris.

24:26.920 --> 24:27.720
Oh là là.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.720
My husband is in
the South African Embassy now.

24:29.800 --> 24:30.960
How exotic.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.600
-But how nice to be home, right?
-Yes.

24:34.360 --> 24:35.600
Your favorite newspaper.

24:37.840 --> 24:38.760
Thank you!

24:46.400 --> 24:47.720
Hmm.

24:50.400 --> 24:52.920
A small Salade Niçoise with an omelet?

24:54.080 --> 24:56.480
Maybe you do still know me after all.

24:57.480 --> 24:59.680
I'm going to wash my hands.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.440
(Background piano continues)

25:31.720 --> 25:33.360
(Fleeting, low-pitched tone)

25:45.760 --> 25:47.160
(Clunky motor)

25:54.240 --> 25:55.800
(Distant church bells)

26:03.280 --> 26:04.200
(Dog barks)

26:11.320 --> 26:12.160
Hello.

26:12.240 --> 26:13.160
Hello.

26:14.360 --> 26:17.840
My car is making strange noises.
I think it's going to break down.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.960
I have to get back to West Berlin.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.560
Ingrid Rauch recommended you.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.760
I hope you can take a look at it.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.200
I know it's a Sunday.

26:29.600 --> 26:31.880
It's not ideal, but...

26:31.960 --> 26:34.440
I was told
you were the only mechanic around.

26:34.520 --> 26:36.600
I don't know my way around here.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.320
Let me see what I can do.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.000
So.

26:49.320 --> 26:50.640
Actually...

26:51.640 --> 26:53.440
(Energetic, orchestral music)

26:53.600 --> 26:56.680
It's me who disabled the car
in the first place.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.000
I had to, so I could speak to you alone.

27:01.040 --> 27:03.200
We need your help
to get across the border.

27:06.760 --> 27:07.600
Help?

27:10.760 --> 27:12.960
You're asking me
to drive you over the border?

27:14.960 --> 27:16.080
And my family.

27:16.480 --> 27:17.920
My wife and two daughters.

27:19.520 --> 27:20.960
We don't even know each other.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.800
There is no one else we can ask.

27:25.440 --> 27:28.120
Do you know how thorough
they are with their searches?

27:29.120 --> 27:30.800
Dogs sniffing around.

27:30.880 --> 27:33.800
Especially now
that this bomb blew up in West Berlin.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.160
Where would you hide?

27:36.680 --> 27:40.720
If I keep your van here for a few days
I can modify it. I know how.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.280
And what happens to me if they catch us?

27:42.360 --> 27:43.320
They won't.

27:44.600 --> 27:45.680
I...

27:45.760 --> 27:47.640
I wish I could help you.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.960
But I don't have the nerves for this.

27:53.800 --> 27:54.640
This is Tina.

27:55.360 --> 27:56.360
My wife.

27:58.120 --> 27:59.360
(Music stops)

28:05.240 --> 28:06.160
I'm sorry.

28:07.240 --> 28:09.120
(Faint, airy, melancholy tones)

28:12.760 --> 28:13.840
Excuse me.

28:13.920 --> 28:15.440
Could you do me a favor?

28:16.120 --> 28:17.840
Get this to my brother.

28:17.920 --> 28:21.360
Thomas Posimski. He lives at
Manteuffelstrasse 27 in Kreuzberg.

28:22.160 --> 28:25.040
-Okay.
-Tell him to hold on to it for now.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.400
Just in case.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Thank you.

28:49.880 --> 28:53.040
Aquarium, Zoo, West Berlin, West Germany

28:53.120 --> 28:54.920
(Ambient, aquatic soundtrack)

29:02.760 --> 29:03.840
Nice haircut.

29:20.560 --> 29:21.560
We'll do it.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.200
What? Now, here?

29:27.000 --> 29:27.920
I...

29:28.760 --> 29:30.880
I thought about it. What you said.

29:31.720 --> 29:32.760
Let's run away.

29:33.600 --> 29:34.840
Wherever you want to go.

29:35.520 --> 29:37.640
-With Max.
-What if I'm not his father?

29:42.880 --> 29:44.840
Thomas Posimski lives in West Berlin now.

29:45.760 --> 29:46.720
Just ask him.

29:46.800 --> 29:47.640
Directly.

29:50.240 --> 29:51.040
And then?

29:52.520 --> 29:54.400
I can't get into East Germany alone.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.200
And I couldn't get out of there
again either.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.600
I need your help.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.320
You want to work with us?

30:04.240 --> 30:06.400
Yes. I'll join the BND.

30:06.480 --> 30:08.920
But only until we find Max,
then we'll run away.

30:09.720 --> 30:10.960
Okay.

30:12.520 --> 30:13.360
(Door squeaks)

30:14.720 --> 30:15.640
(Gasps)

30:15.920 --> 30:16.760
Run.

30:18.200 --> 30:19.160
(Sudden thudding sound effect)

30:19.240 --> 30:19.760
Stop.

30:20.640 --> 30:21.960
(Fast-paced, intense soundtrack)

30:23.080 --> 30:23.800
Hey!

30:27.640 --> 30:28.560
Stop!

30:29.560 --> 30:31.040
(Pedestrians' voices)

30:36.240 --> 30:37.800
(Fast-paced, intense soundtrack continues)

30:40.560 --> 30:41.600
Watch out!

30:42.080 --> 30:43.400
(Some panic)

30:48.720 --> 30:50.400
(Soundtrack quiets down)

30:52.000 --> 30:53.520
(Fast-paced, intense soundtrack restarts)

30:57.320 --> 30:59.040
(Indistinct voices)

31:05.080 --> 31:06.240
(Crashing sound, screams)

31:07.840 --> 31:10.280
(Music fades out,
subway station atmosphere)

31:23.120 --> 31:25.000
We've just decoded several Telex message

31:25.080 --> 31:27.360
sent today between
the Libyan Diplomatic Residence

31:27.440 --> 31:30.320
and what appears to be
Gaddafi's palace in Tripoli.

31:35.400 --> 31:38.160
(English)  -"We delivered the bucket..."
-"Bouquet."

31:39.000 --> 31:40.360
"... bouquet of flowers.

31:40.760 --> 31:43.840
We hope you'll like them
as much as we do."

31:44.360 --> 31:45.240
Shit.

31:45.360 --> 31:48.040
If the West gets their hands on these,
that's it.

31:48.440 --> 31:51.560
They'll blame us
for giving sanctuary to the bombers.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.120
And Kolibri.

31:57.960 --> 31:58.960
Hartmann.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.640
Let me take care of this.

32:02.720 --> 32:03.720
By the way,

32:03.800 --> 32:06.880
when will I get the status report
for Operation Microchip?

32:08.120 --> 32:08.920
Um...

32:09.040 --> 32:10.560
I'm very excited about it.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.000
Very excited.

32:13.040 --> 32:14.080
(Door closes)

32:16.480 --> 32:18.800
(Faint, creeping tones)

32:24.160 --> 32:25.440
Tariq?

32:25.520 --> 32:27.520
(Low-pitched, pulsating drone)

32:32.320 --> 32:34.080
(Faint, airy, atmospheric sounds)

32:39.800 --> 32:41.400
(Dramatic music)

32:47.240 --> 32:50.040
(English)  -Jim. What's new on Kolibri?
-Nothing.

32:50.440 --> 32:55.080
The female suspect in the photograph left
on a private flight bound for Tripoli.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.720
We did find CCTV footage of her
crossing the border

32:57.800 --> 32:59.520
shortly before the bombing
with another woman.

32:59.920 --> 33:02.000
-What other woman?
-We're on that now.

33:02.400 --> 33:06.600
Our guess is that she either works or
lives at the Libyan Diplomatic Residence.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.040
-What are you waiting for?
-She might be a diplomat.

33:09.440 --> 33:13.240
-We need to go through local authorities.
-Bring her in, lock her up.

33:13.640 --> 33:14.440
Why?

33:14.520 --> 33:16.120
I have a message for her from the
American people.

33:16.520 --> 33:20.120
And let's just say,
I'm going to deliver it personally.

33:22.120 --> 33:24.120
(Unnerving, ominous tones)

33:31.600 --> 33:33.840
(Muffled screaming
and a door slamming shut)

33:37.880 --> 33:39.080
-Hello.
-Hello.

33:43.480 --> 33:44.560
Mr. Posimski?

33:45.080 --> 33:45.920
Yes.

33:46.520 --> 33:49.640
I was sent by your sister in Kleinmachnow.

33:49.720 --> 33:52.640
-My sister?
-I was asked to give you this.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.040
Oh, the cassette from Tina!

33:57.440 --> 33:58.280
Thank you.

33:58.800 --> 33:59.800
You're welcome.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.840
(Equipment beeping, faint buzzing)

34:09.400 --> 34:11.280
(Subtle, melancholy chords)

34:27.120 --> 34:29.800
(Door closes, dog barks quietly)

34:39.640 --> 34:40.680
(Another door closes)

34:48.440 --> 34:49.640
(Another door)

34:56.480 --> 34:57.720
(Elevator starting)

35:02.640 --> 35:04.600
(English)  -How do you do?
-Very good, thank you.

35:06.760 --> 35:08.160
Me too.

35:08.960 --> 35:09.760
(Elevator arrives)

35:14.160 --> 35:15.960
(Elevator mechanism)

35:23.600 --> 35:25.160
You like?

35:27.440 --> 35:29.600
We can go on the... dach.

35:33.080 --> 35:34.720
Fidel Castro's favorite.

35:36.080 --> 35:38.880
-You think this is funny.
-Excuse me?

35:39.280 --> 35:43.200
I'm from Miami.
I'm Cuban-American, Herr Schweppenstette.

35:44.200 --> 35:44.960
Oh.

35:45.640 --> 35:46.560
Okay.

35:46.960 --> 35:49.200
But, um... I mean...

35:49.600 --> 35:53.880
have you ever had a Cuban cigar?

35:56.440 --> 35:59.280
In contrary to the USA,

35:59.600 --> 36:03.320
we in the Deutsche Demokratische Republik,
we... have the...

36:03.400 --> 36:04.280
Freiheit?

36:05.600 --> 36:08.680
-Freedom.
-Freedom. The freedom...

36:10.080 --> 36:12.560
to smoke whatever we want.

36:14.320 --> 36:15.160
And...

36:16.680 --> 36:18.480
(German)  no matter where it came from.

36:20.280 --> 36:21.840
All right.

36:23.760 --> 36:24.720
(Elevator stopping)

36:27.400 --> 36:29.520
(Heartbeat-like rhythms,
suspenseful atmosphere)

36:52.320 --> 36:53.800
What a day.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.240
What do you think?
Was it the Libyans alone?

36:59.200 --> 37:01.000
Or did they have help?

37:02.480 --> 37:03.920
You know I can't tell you that.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
(Snorts)

37:05.400 --> 37:09.920
When we find out who did it,
we will retaliate with appropriate force.

37:10.320 --> 37:13.560
Don't use one terrorist
to discredit the whole revolution.

37:14.480 --> 37:16.120
You know what they say,
Herr Schweppenstette?

37:17.240 --> 37:19.840
One man's revolutionary
is another man's terrorist.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.520
Nobody says that.

37:22.600 --> 37:23.640
Nonsense.

37:24.800 --> 37:27.920
-A lot of names mentioned today.
-Aha.

37:28.320 --> 37:30.600
Seems one of your boys is in pretty deep.

37:32.040 --> 37:32.880
And?

37:35.200 --> 37:36.160
Kolibri.

37:38.280 --> 37:39.480
(Tense atmosphere builds)

37:42.440 --> 37:43.920
Mr. Valdez.

37:46.360 --> 37:49.360
In this envelope... is the proof

37:49.760 --> 37:51.720
that it was the Libyans alone.

37:52.200 --> 37:56.600
I can assure you
nobody from us was involved.

38:00.640 --> 38:04.240
Nachtigal is in Lebanon.
Amsel in London.

38:05.080 --> 38:06.720
And Kolibri?

38:09.160 --> 38:10.600
Kolibri is dead.

38:11.280 --> 38:12.840
Dead?

38:14.240 --> 38:16.080
Are you sure?

38:16.480 --> 38:19.160
As if I had done it by myself.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.280
(Singular, icy piano notes)

38:24.640 --> 38:25.880
(High-pitched ping)

38:26.560 --> 38:28.200
Thanks for the cigar.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.800
You're welcome,
Mr. Valdez.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.400
(Doorbell rings)

38:42.960 --> 38:44.800
(German)  Welcome, Rose. Yes?

38:44.880 --> 38:45.720
Yes.

38:45.800 --> 38:46.640
I'm Ingrid.

38:46.720 --> 38:47.560
-Hello.
-Hello.

38:51.160 --> 38:52.320
And who are you?

38:53.640 --> 38:54.560
Ingrid.

38:54.640 --> 38:56.200
What a nice surprise.

38:58.080 --> 39:00.200
After how many years?

39:00.280 --> 39:03.960
You know I can't just call you
from my operational area.

39:04.040 --> 39:07.480
I really wanted to tell you I was coming,
but it was a spontaneous decision.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.080
It had to go fast.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.000
-Please come in.
-Thank you.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.680
Walter only told me about Rose.

39:19.000 --> 39:19.840
Please.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.880
It's not very luxurious, but...

39:25.320 --> 39:26.280
But very comfortable.

39:26.360 --> 39:27.280
Thank you.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.280
And you?

39:33.360 --> 39:34.520
Where will you sleep?

39:37.080 --> 39:38.080
I thought...

39:38.160 --> 39:39.760
You can't afford a hotel room?

39:43.240 --> 39:44.440
To be honest, no.

39:44.880 --> 39:46.080
But you're elegant, as always.

39:47.360 --> 39:50.320
Even as a kid, my sister
would have rather starved to death

39:50.400 --> 39:52.040
than do without fine clothes.

39:53.040 --> 39:54.480
I won't stay long.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.440
-Well, in that case.
-I promise.

39:56.520 --> 39:57.480
Would you like some tea?

39:57.560 --> 39:58.520
Gladly.

40:02.240 --> 40:04.040
I'm very happy to see you.

40:07.440 --> 40:08.440
This is for you.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.880
Have you heard anything of Martin?

40:15.640 --> 40:16.520
No.

40:18.520 --> 40:19.880
(Quiet music)

40:26.280 --> 40:27.080
Hello?

40:48.760 --> 40:50.040
You look different.

40:51.040 --> 40:52.040
(Snorts)

40:53.680 --> 40:55.400
It's been three years.

40:58.440 --> 40:59.920
I read your book.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.200
(Light vocals)

41:03.280 --> 41:04.680
When did it start?

41:05.880 --> 41:07.240
When exactly?

41:13.000 --> 41:14.600
She was already pregnant, Martin.

41:16.520 --> 41:18.080
If that's what you're asking.

41:20.640 --> 41:23.640
("Terra Titanic" by Peter Schilling)

41:24.720 --> 41:26.040
(Doorbell rings)

41:28.560 --> 41:30.560
(Vocal synth-pop music)

41:50.520 --> 41:51.520
I'll do it.

41:52.320 --> 41:54.360
("Terra Titanic" reaches vocal climax)

41:57.720 --> 41:59.080
("Terra Titanic" echoes out)

41:59.160 --> 42:00.560
(Eerie music begins)

43:47.400 --> 43:49.040
