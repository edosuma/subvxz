Welcome,
to Crazy Desire Island.

Mr. Robin, why were you
creeping in the bushes
like the creepy creeper creep?

02:34.855 --> 02:37.122
So I can eavesdrop on you all
without being seen.

02:37.124 --> 02:38.924
That's super creepy, bro.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.359
Even that suit's creepy.

02:40.361 --> 02:43.595
It's island style.
Good for sitting in bushes.

02:43.597 --> 02:46.031
-Creep.
-Wasn't someone trying
to make a wish?

02:46.033 --> 02:51.103
Yeah, I wished
that we were off this
<i>garbage island!</i>

02:51.105 --> 02:55.374
But why would you leave
a place that can make your
greatest wishes come true?

02:55.376 --> 02:57.776
Is you saying
this island is magical?

02:57.778 --> 03:01.680
That's right.
All you need to do
is imagine your true desire

03:01.682 --> 03:04.349
and the island will
bring it to life.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.918
How does that work exactly?

Oh, would you like me
to spend the next 40 seconds

03:08.889 --> 03:12.124

the island's mystical powers?

03:12.126 --> 03:15.360
Why, yes!
Yes, I would.

03:15.362 --> 03:19.932

is the portal
for all the magic.

03:19.934 --> 03:21.166
Any questions?

03:21.168 --> 03:23.402
-Nope.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.679
Yeah. Should we
wish for something or not?

03:33.681 --> 03:36.815
Yes. But be careful
what you wish for.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.450
You just might get it.

you're warning us

(ALL CHEERING)

09:22.596 --> 09:25.797
Oh, it is the wondefulness
to be home.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.499
I gots to get me a shower.

09:27.501 --> 09:29.134
I am ripe.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.135
Sniff me, mama.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.137
-Ew, get away from me.
-(GRUNTS)

09:33.105 --> 09:34.306
I'll smell you, bro.

09:34.308 --> 09:35.507
(SNIFFS)

09:35.509 --> 09:38.109
Whoa, doggy. Sick!
Now smell me!

09:40.247 --> 09:41.613
(YELPS)

09:41.615 --> 09:43.782
Nasty, bro. (CHUCKLES)

09:43.784 --> 09:46.785
You think that's bad?
Smell behind my ear.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.821
BOTH: Ew!

09:49.823 --> 09:52.824
Ugh, I'm just gonna watch
<i>Pretty, Pretty Pegasus.</i>

09:56.262 --> 09:58.229
What's up with the TV?

09:58.231 --> 10:01.499
I thought,
perhaps the recording box
would make a nice hat.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.435
Do you like it?

10:03.437 --> 10:05.837
Ugh, we've been here
less than a minute
and I already hate everything.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.239
I... I wish I was back
on the island.

10:08.741 --> 10:10.008
Oh, really?

10:10.010 --> 10:12.377
So, you might say
that I was right!

10:12.379 --> 10:15.180
You should watch out
for what you wish for.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.281
Yes.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.550
Yes! Knowledge bomb dropped!

(MIMICS EXPLOSION)

10:21.955 --> 10:25.824
Friend Robin, I must give you
the many thanks for helping us
survive upon the island.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.225
Well, I learned my lesson.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.194
-End this wish already,
so we can...
-ROBIN: Shh.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.629
There is something else.

10:31.764 --> 10:33.665
I have the feelings for you.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.934
That I hope
you will reciprocate...

10:36.669 --> 10:38.503
Boyfriend.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.672
Boy... Boyfriend?

10:40.674 --> 10:42.040

10:42.042 --> 10:43.308
(SIGHS)

10:43.310 --> 10:45.844

I'm canceling my wish.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.814

It's all I ever wanted!

10:52.419 --> 10:54.052
