JAKE: (PANTING) Remember last time
we were out this way?

00:37.204 --> 00:40.299
It was right after you messed things
all up with Flame Princess.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.209
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, that sucked.

the Dungeon Train, remember?

FINN: That was awesome.
JAKE: No. It wasn't.

00:47.965 --> 00:50.844
Sure it was. Anyway, Flambo's brother's map

00:50.968 --> 00:53.687
says the weird cave should be,
like, right over...

00:54.346 --> 00:56.849
Ah! It's right here.
(CHUCKLES) Come on, Jake.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.606

let me get out my sidewalk chalk.

You can't use that stuff in here.

The foyer is a safe space.

01:17.202 --> 01:20.581
Man, not even Jake could smash
through this mess.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.299

01:23.333 --> 01:25.051

03:04.851 --> 03:06.979
Well clone, Finn. You solved the magic door.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.110
That ought to have done it. And...

03:16.363 --> 03:17.364
Oh.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.742
I guess this door's just too tricky for me.

Better head back and regroup.

04:03.785 --> 04:04.786

then disappear again like that.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.689

05:48.348 --> 05:50.225

scrambled up and down.

05:52.853 --> 05:53.854

05:54.104 --> 05:57.074
What? Oh. Uh-oh.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.952
- FINN: Well?
- Well, I followed your map,

06:01.236 --> 06:02.863
but there's just a bunch of grass here.

06:02.988 --> 06:04.114
What? Let me see!

06:05.740 --> 06:08.243
Dang it. (BABBLES)

06:08.869 --> 06:11.873
So, yeah. Everything I did to try
to make sense of the maze

06:11.955 --> 06:13.707
or to play it safe totally backfired.

06:14.124 --> 06:16.877

and started just charging in willy-nilly,

06:17.252 --> 06:18.845
I was able to get to the end and find you.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.881

06:21.590 --> 06:23.888

remember any of it.

06:24.134 --> 06:27.138
I don't know.
I'm just hoping, maybe if I sleep it off,

06:27.387 --> 06:28.388
maybe I'll be better in the morning.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.392

You wanna try opening 'em?

07:03.048 --> 07:04.300
It's a beautiful day.

to tell me if this hat looks cool.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.553

07:10.055 --> 07:13.275
If I open 'em now, it'll just be the same.
I got to wait till s0mething's different.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.436
Yeah. That makes sense, I guess.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.906
So, um, I got you a little something.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.568
