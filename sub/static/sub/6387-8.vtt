WEBVTT

00:00.059 --> 00:02.020
Previously on <i>Californication...</i>

00:02.054 --> 00:03.892
You have a magnificent body.

00:03.926 --> 00:06.252
Do you think I have
what it takes to be an actress?

00:06.372 --> 00:08.684
- Yes.
- Eddie Nero said you got magic fingers.

00:08.804 --> 00:10.491
I need your words.

00:10.526 --> 00:12.263
Guess who's back in the picture?

00:12.298 --> 00:14.477
Eddie fucking Nero!

00:14.511 --> 00:16.046
I don't work
for Stu and Marcy anymore.

00:16.081 --> 00:17.281
So this whole thing

00:17.316 --> 00:20.786
isn't quite as inappropriate
as it once was.

00:20.820 --> 00:21.889
What?

00:21.923 --> 00:23.092
Will you read my screenplay?

00:23.127 --> 00:24.601
I give it ten pages.

00:24.635 --> 00:26.669
Hey, can I come in?

00:26.703 --> 00:29.043
It's Richard, you know,
he won't stop drinking.

00:29.077 --> 00:31.446
I think I made
a terrible mistake, you know?

00:31.480 --> 00:33.716
Hank, I woke up
in a strange woman's bed.

00:33.750 --> 00:34.984
I can't find my wedding ring.

00:35.018 --> 00:36.018
I'm fucked!

00:36.053 --> 00:37.054
Who's that?

00:37.088 --> 00:38.455
This is my girlfriend.

00:38.489 --> 00:39.556
- Holly.
- Holly.

00:39.590 --> 00:40.691
Uh-huh, uh-huh,
uh-huh.

00:40.725 --> 00:42.059
Whoa!

00:42.093 --> 00:43.293
Hey, hey!

00:43.327 --> 00:44.561
- What the fuck?
- Hey, hey--

00:44.596 --> 00:45.796
You come to my home?

00:45.830 --> 00:46.963
How fucking dare you?

00:46.998 --> 00:48.765
Batesy, Batesy, she's with me.

00:48.800 --> 00:49.966
You can take your tramp

00:50.001 --> 00:52.902
and you can get
the fuck out of my house.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

01:10.530 --> 01:11.630
Thank you for agreeing

01:11.664 --> 01:14.233
to break your fast
with me this morning.

01:14.267 --> 01:15.801
It's fine.

01:15.835 --> 01:16.935
It's more than fine, young lady.

01:16.970 --> 01:19.237
I know how particularly displeased

01:19.272 --> 01:20.939
you've been with your papa of late.

01:20.974 --> 01:22.841
You haven't really given me
much of a chance

01:22.876 --> 01:25.143
to think fondly of you, papa.

01:25.178 --> 01:27.513
Or even miss you, for that matter.

01:27.547 --> 01:28.814
You've been around.

01:28.848 --> 01:29.815
A lot.

01:29.849 --> 01:31.316
Mucking with things.

01:31.351 --> 01:32.885
I muck not.

01:32.919 --> 01:35.255
Says the man responsible
for the savage beating

01:35.289 --> 01:37.858
my boyfriend suffered
at the hands of some thug.

01:37.892 --> 01:40.361
Nonsense, that was just
an unfortunate misunderstanding.

01:40.395 --> 01:42.730
And he's not a thug,
he's an entrepreneur.

01:42.765 --> 01:45.166
And a humanitarian.

01:45.201 --> 01:46.535
And you know
what they say--

01:46.569 --> 01:49.805
whatever doesn't kill us
makes even us more annoying.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.107
Did you read his screenplay yet?

01:51.141 --> 01:52.977
Is your mom still mad at me?

01:53.012 --> 01:54.012
What do you think?

01:54.046 --> 01:55.280
On a scale of one to ten.

01:55.314 --> 01:56.348
11.

01:56.382 --> 01:57.616
I can get that down.

01:57.650 --> 01:59.184
Did you read his screenplay yet?

02:01.254 --> 02:04.691
What?
I can't hear you.

02:07.928 --> 02:08.995
No, not yet.

02:09.030 --> 02:10.797
Why?
You promised.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.566
There's just no upside, darlin'.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.635
If I read it and it sucks,

02:14.669 --> 02:16.170
then I have to endure
his pathetic attempts

02:16.204 --> 02:17.605
and give him feedback.

02:17.639 --> 02:18.707
The last young aspirant

02:18.741 --> 02:20.709
I gave notes to
wound up in the hospital.

02:20.744 --> 02:21.844
And if it's even remotely good,

02:21.878 --> 02:23.480
why would I want to know
that about him?

02:23.514 --> 02:24.581
You see my dilemma here?

02:24.615 --> 02:26.049
I'll never talk to you again.

02:26.084 --> 02:28.052
You barely talk to me now.

02:28.087 --> 02:29.220
I'll become a stripper.

02:29.255 --> 02:31.889
I'll read it.

02:31.924 --> 02:32.991
Tomorrow.

02:33.025 --> 02:34.025
Today.

02:34.060 --> 02:35.927
Today.

02:41.434 --> 02:43.334
You're fucking kidding me.

02:47.473 --> 02:51.743
Rebecca!

02:51.777 --> 02:54.779
This is why I hate coming here.

02:59.986 --> 03:09.994
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:56.360 --> 03:57.706
That bad, huh?

03:57.826 --> 03:58.983
It's that good.

03:59.867 --> 04:00.918
Really?

04:00.953 --> 04:02.487
The writing is exceptional.

04:02.997 --> 04:04.784
But that's not what pisses me off.

04:04.904 --> 04:06.109
Well, it does piss me off.

04:06.229 --> 04:07.562
I mean, where's
that little douche get off

04:07.682 --> 04:09.738
being even a halfway decent writer?

04:09.772 --> 04:11.564
And where--where does
he find time to write

04:11.684 --> 04:13.447
when he has to tend
to that fucking mop of hair?

04:13.567 --> 04:15.143
Oh, whoa, whoa
you're getting off topic.

04:15.177 --> 04:16.277
Tell me more about the script.

04:16.310 --> 04:19.314
Don't you even fucking dare, agent.

04:26.255 --> 04:29.044
So...what's it about?

04:29.298 --> 04:31.632
The whole fucking thing is about him.

04:31.667 --> 04:32.734
And Becca.

04:32.768 --> 04:34.102
So?

04:34.136 --> 04:36.962
So? It's--it's--
it's very sexual, Karen.

04:37.082 --> 04:37.947
Very sexual.

04:38.067 --> 04:39.274
And your point is?

04:40.472 --> 04:42.344
It's also--
it's very dirty.

04:42.378 --> 04:43.478
And disturbing.

04:43.513 --> 04:45.180
And it's very, very...

04:45.214 --> 04:46.482
sexual.

04:46.516 --> 04:48.884
It's also disgusting, actually.

04:48.918 --> 04:50.853
That's what it is, is disgusting.

04:50.887 --> 04:54.323
Your entire literary aesthetic
revolves around sex, so...

04:54.357 --> 04:55.590
It does not.

04:55.625 --> 04:56.792
- Does.
- Doesn't.

04:56.826 --> 04:57.826
You know what,
I'm not gonna do this with you.

04:57.860 --> 04:58.827
Doesn't.
Okay.

04:58.861 --> 05:00.262
Well, say what you will
about my oeuvre.

05:00.296 --> 05:02.731
But Tyler's script involves
a young aspiring writer

05:02.765 --> 05:05.000
who has a very down and dirty
sexual relationship

05:05.034 --> 05:07.502
with the daughter
of a very successful novelist.

05:07.536 --> 05:08.836
You're not that successful.

05:08.870 --> 05:10.972
Oh, Karen, that is so funny.

05:11.006 --> 05:13.541
I'm glad you still find time
to emasculate me

05:13.576 --> 05:15.177
while Rome is clearly burning.

05:15.211 --> 05:16.445
I can always find time for that.

05:16.479 --> 05:18.113
So wait, no, wait, and this, and this.

05:18.148 --> 05:20.950
The--the--the main character
harbors fantasies about fucking

05:20.985 --> 05:22.586
the extremely MILF-y mother
of his girlfriend.

05:22.620 --> 05:23.687
Really?

05:23.721 --> 05:24.755
How do you like them apples, Karen?

05:24.789 --> 05:26.223
How's that make you feel?

05:26.257 --> 05:27.825
Good, actually.

05:27.859 --> 05:29.560
Yeah.

05:29.594 --> 05:30.894
He's kind of hot.

05:30.929 --> 05:32.162
You know what?
It's not funny.

05:32.197 --> 05:35.432
I am just so disgusted
by your whole scene here.

05:35.466 --> 05:36.666
You're disgusted with my scene?

05:36.701 --> 05:37.934
Yeah, I am.

05:37.969 --> 05:39.569
How the fuck did that happen?

05:39.604 --> 05:40.971
In my absence, your whole life

05:41.005 --> 05:44.074
has become this sexual playground.

05:44.108 --> 05:47.377
Jesus, so what are you gonna do?

05:47.411 --> 05:48.845
Are you--are you
gonna give him notes,

05:48.879 --> 05:50.412
or what are you gonna do?

05:50.447 --> 05:51.580
Yeah, I'm gonna give him
notes, I'm gonna give him notes.

05:51.614 --> 05:52.781
But first I'm gonna see my daughter.

05:52.815 --> 05:53.782
Where is she?

05:53.817 --> 05:54.984
She's at work.

05:55.018 --> 05:56.552
I'm gonna go see her at work.

05:56.587 --> 05:57.720
I got a bone to pick with her.

05:57.754 --> 05:58.821
- Good luck with that.
- All right, okay.

05:58.855 --> 06:00.490
- Good.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

06:00.524 --> 06:01.824
How's Batesy?

06:01.859 --> 06:02.859
Rehab.

06:03.994 --> 06:05.729
Today's family day.

06:05.763 --> 06:06.764
Should be a hoot.

06:06.798 --> 06:08.432
Awesome.

06:08.466 --> 06:10.468
You still thinking about leaving him?

06:20.379 --> 06:21.879
Really, Becca?

06:21.914 --> 06:22.913
What?

06:22.948 --> 06:23.914
I'm troubled.

06:23.949 --> 06:25.216
You don't like it?

06:25.250 --> 06:27.151
No, I don't like it.
I don't like it one bit.

06:27.185 --> 06:28.586
What don't you like about it?

06:28.620 --> 06:30.955
Well, for one, it's very dirty.

06:30.989 --> 06:32.156
Very dirty.

06:32.191 --> 06:34.258
So? Dirty is your thing,
isn't it?

06:34.293 --> 06:35.993
Whatever.

06:36.028 --> 06:39.264
It also seems
painfully autobiographical.

06:39.298 --> 06:40.765
Dad, please, is everything
you write the truth?

06:40.800 --> 06:41.800
Or is it embellished?

06:41.834 --> 06:43.936
Young aspiring writer seeks out

06:43.970 --> 06:46.172
daughter of very successful novelist

06:46.206 --> 06:47.507
and proceeds to bed her?

06:47.541 --> 06:48.608
Sound familiar?

06:48.642 --> 06:50.042
You're not that successful, dad.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.779
Jesus Christ, is nothing sacred?

06:52.813 --> 06:53.947
Is this about sex?

06:53.981 --> 06:55.282
Did you think I was
never going to grow up

06:55.316 --> 06:56.683
and have a sexual relationship
with someone?

06:56.717 --> 06:58.651
A father sure can hope.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.086
Sometimes I think you wish

07:00.120 --> 07:02.989
I stayed some asexual little
Goth muppet creature forever.

07:03.023 --> 07:06.125
You say that like it's a bad thing.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.660
Would you prefer I didn't enjoy sex?

07:07.695 --> 07:09.294
Will you stop saying "sex"?

07:09.329 --> 07:10.863
This is a place of business.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.298
Yeah, and you're holding up the line.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.067
This is not
what I wanted for you, Becca.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.837
To inspire some stupid fucking
mumblecore bullshit.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.006
Just sit down with him.
Give him your thoughts.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.408
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna give him
my thoughts all right.

07:21.442 --> 07:25.412
I got his address.
Look, right here.

07:25.447 --> 07:26.580
Be gentle.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.048
He talks a good game, but deep down,

07:28.083 --> 07:29.517
he's really just a sensitive artist.

07:29.551 --> 07:30.718
Oh, uh-huh.

07:30.752 --> 07:32.587
Uh, yeah, I'm gonna call him.

07:32.621 --> 07:33.888
I will let him know.

07:33.923 --> 07:35.790
Okay, bye.

07:35.824 --> 07:36.925
Hello, hello!

07:36.959 --> 07:40.462
Ugh, what the fuck are you doing here?

07:40.496 --> 07:43.232
Oh, and a very fine day to you too.

07:43.266 --> 07:44.433
What have I told you?

07:44.467 --> 07:45.568
You don't piss on the losing class.

07:45.602 --> 07:46.902
That's rude.

07:46.937 --> 07:47.937
I know, baby.

07:47.971 --> 07:49.472
Baby, he just brings it out in me.

07:49.506 --> 07:52.175
Charlie, I'm sorry, I think
what Marcy was trying to say is

07:52.209 --> 07:53.977
what the fuck are you doing here?

07:54.011 --> 07:55.412
I was in the neighborhood.

07:55.446 --> 07:58.415
I thought it might be nice
to lay eyes on my very own son.

07:58.449 --> 08:00.951
Ha! You were
in the neighborhood?

08:00.985 --> 08:02.085
That's bullshit.

08:02.120 --> 08:03.487
You wanted to lay eyes on Lizzie.

08:03.521 --> 08:05.555
Well, you can't blame a man for that.

08:05.589 --> 08:07.657
Oh, really, sweetheart?

08:07.691 --> 08:09.459
You wanna go down this road?

08:09.493 --> 08:11.728
You wanna sink the pink
ever again in this lifetime?

08:11.762 --> 08:14.231
Hey, hey, hey,
remember what Dr. Lawson said

08:14.265 --> 08:15.732
about using sex as a weapon.

08:15.766 --> 08:16.833
I don't care.

08:16.867 --> 08:17.834
Whoa, whoa,
who's Dr. Lawson?

08:17.868 --> 08:19.403
- Couples therapist.
- Shh!

08:19.437 --> 08:22.105
Hey, there's no shame in
workshopping your relationship.

08:23.475 --> 08:25.076
Five minutes, Charlie.

08:25.110 --> 08:26.511
Okay?
He needs a nap.

08:26.545 --> 08:28.046
Otherwise he's gonna be
a fucking nightmare

08:28.080 --> 08:29.881
when we get back.

08:29.916 --> 08:31.149
God damn it!
Come on.

08:31.184 --> 08:32.251
Motherfucker charges us if we're late.

08:32.284 --> 08:36.587
Charlie, uh, enjoy yourself.

08:36.623 --> 08:38.957
Just keep your fucking hands
off my Oscars.

08:38.991 --> 08:40.226
Coming!

08:40.260 --> 08:42.727
I don't like this thing
with these stones.

08:42.761 --> 08:44.764
I need a flat surface.

08:52.806 --> 08:54.073
Shh, I'm sorry, Charlie.

08:54.108 --> 08:55.074
He just fell asleep.

08:55.109 --> 08:58.477
Bummer.

08:59.646 --> 09:02.782
Guess I'll just go, then.

09:02.817 --> 09:04.217
No other reason for me to be here.

09:04.252 --> 09:07.254
Yeah, you should go.

09:07.288 --> 09:09.956
Yep.

09:09.991 --> 09:13.393
I'll just...be on my way.

09:13.427 --> 09:16.329
See ya.

09:22.868 --> 09:23.969
Guest house?

09:24.003 --> 09:26.104
I got a better idea.

09:41.355 --> 09:43.390
Hi there!

09:43.424 --> 09:44.692
Hi.

09:44.726 --> 09:47.195
I'm looking for Tyler.

09:47.229 --> 09:49.264
Oh, he's at school.

09:49.298 --> 09:52.667
Or work.
Or...somewhere.

09:52.701 --> 09:54.936
I'm not really sure.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.637
Some mom I am, huh?

09:56.671 --> 09:58.539
Any idea when he might be back?

09:58.573 --> 10:00.574
No.

10:04.379 --> 10:05.379
Hey.

10:05.413 --> 10:06.880
Are you Hank Moody?

10:06.915 --> 10:09.049
Yep, guilty.

10:09.084 --> 10:11.051
It's so nice to meet you.

10:11.085 --> 10:12.953
Becca is a doll.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.822
Oh, I like
to think so. Yeah.

10:14.856 --> 10:16.189
I'm Lisa.

10:16.224 --> 10:17.391
Tyler's mom.

10:17.425 --> 10:18.626
Oh, hey, Lisa.

10:18.660 --> 10:21.662
Do you wanna come in?

10:21.696 --> 10:23.030
No, I--

10:23.064 --> 10:24.798
Are you sure?

10:24.833 --> 10:26.366
Yeah.

10:26.401 --> 10:28.735
'Cause I'm about to get
really fucking high.

10:28.770 --> 10:30.471
Oh.

10:30.505 --> 10:33.307
Well, in that case.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.475
Where's the man of the house?

10:35.510 --> 10:37.411
Out and about.

10:37.445 --> 10:39.646
We had a big fight.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.347
About what?

10:41.382 --> 10:43.549
Same old shit.

10:43.583 --> 10:47.152
The drinking, the control issues.

10:47.187 --> 10:49.688
Yeah, I hear that.
That shit's universal.

10:49.722 --> 10:52.490
Did you read Tyler's script?

10:52.525 --> 10:54.426
Yes, I did.

10:54.460 --> 10:56.395
It's very raw, isn't it?

10:56.429 --> 10:57.929
Yeah, I, uh...
That's one way to put it.

10:57.964 --> 10:59.398
You know, it's our fault.

10:59.432 --> 11:04.704
Because we raised him in this
very sexually free household.

11:04.738 --> 11:06.739
Yeah, about that--

11:06.774 --> 11:07.907
Can you do me a favor?

11:07.941 --> 11:10.510
Sure, but I can't promise anything.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.611
Can I see your penis?

11:16.482 --> 11:17.883
Look, I know where this is going.

11:17.917 --> 11:20.051
You do?

11:20.086 --> 11:21.586
You're a very beautiful woman.

11:21.620 --> 11:23.955
And I'm very angry with Tyler

11:23.989 --> 11:26.023
for defiling my daughter on the page.

11:26.058 --> 11:27.391
But as much as I'd like
to stick it to Tyler

11:27.426 --> 11:29.193
and bang out his mom--

11:29.228 --> 11:30.861
sorry for being
so charming--

11:30.896 --> 11:32.763
I don't want to hurt my daughter.

11:32.797 --> 11:34.298
It's cool, Hank.

11:34.332 --> 11:35.766
I just wanted to see your cock.

11:35.800 --> 11:39.036
I haven't seen one in a while
and I like to study them.

11:39.070 --> 11:41.070
Yeah? Well, what about
Tyler's dad?

11:41.105 --> 11:45.475
He--he can't
scratch that itch?

11:45.509 --> 11:47.043
Not exactly.

11:47.077 --> 11:48.211
What are--what are
we talking about here,

11:48.245 --> 11:51.147
a wheelchair situation?

11:51.181 --> 11:55.484
No.

11:55.518 --> 11:57.986
Penises are my passion.

11:58.021 --> 12:02.991
Oh...Ooh.

12:03.025 --> 12:05.427
Yikes.

12:05.462 --> 12:08.130
Oh, all right.

12:08.164 --> 12:10.598
Okay, all right.

12:10.633 --> 12:12.801
All right, these are--
these are yours.

12:12.835 --> 12:14.169
Oh, those are mine.

12:14.203 --> 12:15.904
Not the penises.

12:15.938 --> 12:17.139
Right, I got it, I got it.

12:17.173 --> 12:19.740
Okay.

12:19.775 --> 12:22.943
So would you mind?

12:22.978 --> 12:26.246
Well, I have been told
I have a very pretty penis.

12:26.281 --> 12:28.281
I'll be the judge of that.

12:39.060 --> 12:41.194
Fla-dong.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.696
Solid.

12:42.730 --> 12:44.798
Solid?

12:44.832 --> 12:46.933
Thanks, I guess.

12:46.968 --> 12:50.304
He looks a lot cooler with
some blood rushing through him.

12:50.339 --> 12:52.640
What the fuck is going on here?

12:52.674 --> 12:54.609
Oh, sweetie, it's nothing.
It's just work.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.344
We have one--
one fight.

12:56.379 --> 12:57.579
And you go looking for dick!

12:57.613 --> 12:58.747
You know what?

12:58.781 --> 13:00.081
After I'm through
with this piece of shit,

13:00.116 --> 13:01.582
I'm gonna beat
the fuckin' bi out of you

13:01.617 --> 13:02.617
- once and for all, woman.
- Wait!

13:02.651 --> 13:03.985
Wait, no!

13:04.020 --> 13:05.053
- Please.
- Come on!

13:05.087 --> 13:06.388
- Please!
- Come on!

13:06.422 --> 13:08.290
Wait!
He's Rebecca's father!

13:08.324 --> 13:11.326
He's Hank Moody.

13:16.099 --> 13:17.967
Ahh...

13:18.001 --> 13:20.036
We love Becca!

13:20.070 --> 13:21.237
Oh!

13:21.272 --> 13:25.742
She's a doll!
She's a doll.

13:29.013 --> 13:30.614
Ah, God, I love fucking you.

13:30.648 --> 13:32.115
God, I love fucking you too.

13:32.150 --> 13:34.551
I especially love fucking you
in my ex-wife's marital bed.

13:34.585 --> 13:35.685
Oh, understandably.

13:35.720 --> 13:36.986
But you should probably
be quick about it,

13:37.021 --> 13:39.222
'cause they're gonna be
back in a minute.

13:39.256 --> 13:42.291
Don't think any woman's ever
told me to be quick about it.

13:42.325 --> 13:44.359
That's...gonna make me...

13:46.562 --> 13:47.562
...come.

13:50.466 --> 13:51.699
Nicely done.

13:55.071 --> 13:57.740
You see how long I last with you?

13:57.774 --> 13:59.876
Yes, I have no complaints
in that department.

13:59.910 --> 14:01.511
Did you come?

14:01.545 --> 14:02.712
No.

14:02.746 --> 14:04.714
How come?

14:04.748 --> 14:06.015
It's not your problem, Charlie.

14:06.049 --> 14:07.850
I didn't make you come.

14:07.884 --> 14:10.452
This is totally my problem.

14:10.487 --> 14:15.091
Okay, well, um,
I've been having money troubles.

14:15.125 --> 14:16.859
I mean, Stu and Marcy pay okay,

14:16.893 --> 14:19.528
but between my shitty car,
acting lessons,

14:19.563 --> 14:20.697
now I need headshots...

14:20.731 --> 14:22.299
Headshots.

14:22.333 --> 14:24.201
Done.
My treat.

14:24.235 --> 14:26.603
I can't let you do that, Charlie.

14:26.638 --> 14:27.972
You just let me foul you.

14:28.006 --> 14:29.039
I owe you one.

14:29.074 --> 14:33.010
You're so sweet.

14:40.052 --> 14:41.886
Oh, holy shit, they're home!

14:41.921 --> 14:44.189
They're home.

14:44.223 --> 14:46.825
God, I'm so hard right now.

14:46.860 --> 14:48.961
Oh, God, I'm so hard right now.

14:48.996 --> 14:50.263
Oh, God, yes, you are.

14:50.298 --> 14:51.832
Drag that big boy.

14:51.866 --> 14:54.334
Take out that fucking bat
and hit me with it, bitch.

14:54.369 --> 14:55.602
You know I will!

14:55.636 --> 14:56.903
Yeah, let me see that.

14:56.937 --> 14:58.538
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:58.572 --> 15:00.773
Oh, God!

15:00.808 --> 15:01.874
Why does couples therapy
get me so worked up?

15:01.909 --> 15:03.576
Ours is not to reason why, baby.

15:03.610 --> 15:05.844
Ours is but to fuck
each other's brains out.

15:05.879 --> 15:06.845
- Yeah.
- Come on.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.781
- So I'll do it.
- Yeah.

15:08.815 --> 15:11.116
Oh, wait a minute, wait.

15:11.150 --> 15:12.251
What do you wanna play?

15:12.285 --> 15:14.220
I don't know, what do you wanna play?

15:14.254 --> 15:16.088
Ooh, ooh!

15:16.122 --> 15:18.257
Let's do the one where
Charlie is still your husband,

15:18.291 --> 15:19.559
but he's upstairs in a wheelchair.

15:19.593 --> 15:20.793
I like that one!

15:20.828 --> 15:22.261
Who are you?

15:22.296 --> 15:23.596
I'm gonna be the contractor.

15:23.630 --> 15:24.731
Oh, yeah.

15:24.765 --> 15:27.133
Uh...Howdy, ma'am.

15:27.167 --> 15:30.336
Uh, we're just about done for the day.

15:30.370 --> 15:31.570
Oh, why, thank you very much.

15:31.605 --> 15:34.340
You and your boys do such good work.

15:34.374 --> 15:38.143
Yeah, I was sorry to see your
bald husband's in a wheelchair.

15:38.178 --> 15:41.747
Well, yes,

15:41.781 --> 15:44.116
times have been tough
since the accident.

15:44.150 --> 15:45.717
I bet ya he doesn't fuck you
so good now.

15:45.752 --> 15:46.751
- No.
- No.

15:46.786 --> 15:48.586
No. No.

15:48.621 --> 15:50.855
It's just like a piece
of overcooked penne

15:50.890 --> 15:52.190
between his legs.

15:52.224 --> 15:54.125
No! But does he
eat your pussy?

15:54.160 --> 15:56.127
Well, he does try.

15:56.162 --> 15:57.329
But he doesn't get my spot.

15:57.363 --> 15:59.731
Well, I got just the tool for that.

15:59.766 --> 16:02.334
Take a look at that.

16:02.368 --> 16:04.336
- Oh, my. Oh, my God.
- Yep.

16:04.370 --> 16:06.605
So that's what a dick's
supposed to look like.

16:06.639 --> 16:07.973
No, no, no, no, no.

16:08.008 --> 16:09.642
- Yeah.
- Ooh.

16:09.676 --> 16:11.343
Yeah, come on!

16:11.378 --> 16:12.478
Come on!

16:15.815 --> 16:19.484
How much disrespect can one man take?

16:23.689 --> 16:25.023
Oh, come on!

16:25.057 --> 16:26.658
Are you fucking kidding me?

16:26.693 --> 16:28.861
I just don't know
how y-y-you deal

16:28.895 --> 16:30.963
with them growing up, these kids,

16:30.997 --> 16:32.564
and becoming sexual beings, y'know?

16:32.599 --> 16:36.302
They're sexual beings from
the moment they're born, Hank.

16:36.336 --> 16:37.837
Yes.

16:37.871 --> 16:41.407
Tyler, he was fixated
on his penis from the get-go.

16:41.441 --> 16:44.310
He was always, like,
fucking tugging on that thing.

16:44.344 --> 16:46.112
I have a photo series

16:46.146 --> 16:52.084
that chronicles Tyler's penis
from birth to now.

16:52.118 --> 16:53.319
Wanna see it, Hank?

16:53.353 --> 16:54.853
No, not at all.

16:54.888 --> 16:57.489
I-I think I'd rather see
crime scene photos.

16:57.524 --> 17:01.727
I think someone's
a little uptight, huh, babe?

17:01.761 --> 17:04.429
You don't have
to worry about Becca, Hank.

17:04.464 --> 17:07.900
She's experimenting
in a very safe environment.

17:07.935 --> 17:12.104
What does that mean exactly?

17:12.138 --> 17:13.539
We encourage Tyler to bring
his girlfriends here

17:13.573 --> 17:16.275
instead of...you know,
fucking 'em in secret

17:16.309 --> 17:18.242
in the backseat of a car
or some cheap motel room.

17:18.278 --> 17:19.877
That's--that's not
making me feel any better.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.280
Well, it should,

17:21.314 --> 17:23.515
because if the screams
that are coming from that room

17:23.549 --> 17:25.849
are any indication...

17:25.885 --> 17:29.454
That girl is clearly enjoying herself.

17:29.489 --> 17:32.357
Still not helping.

17:32.391 --> 17:35.360
Yeah, she is a beautiful girl, Hank.

17:38.898 --> 17:43.267
Hey, would you consider
letting us photograph you, hmm?

17:43.302 --> 17:46.637
Oh, oh, well, I'm flattered.

17:46.672 --> 17:50.041
But I don't wanna end up
in <i>The Big Book of Cocks.</i>

17:50.075 --> 17:51.809
Hey, moms.

17:51.843 --> 17:53.644
Oh, look, Tyler's home.

17:53.678 --> 17:56.813
- My baby.
- Oh, Jesus.

17:56.848 --> 17:59.750
Whoa. What, are you
guys high again?

18:01.252 --> 18:02.586
Hey, Hank.

18:02.620 --> 18:04.588
What, are you here
to beat me up for something?

18:04.623 --> 18:07.124
Yeah, but only in the literary sense.

18:07.159 --> 18:08.460
You ready for some notes?

18:08.494 --> 18:11.062
Wow.

18:11.097 --> 18:13.064
Come on, Lizzie.

18:13.098 --> 18:17.168
I can't believe that
you fucked your son's nanny.

18:17.202 --> 18:20.903
In his mother's bed!
Ew.

18:20.937 --> 18:23.105
I can't believe you play dirty
disrespectful sex games

18:23.139 --> 18:25.340
involving your son's father!

18:25.374 --> 18:26.708
I'm sorry about that, Charlie.

18:26.742 --> 18:29.110
But that was one of the milder ones.

18:29.144 --> 18:32.146
There are others?

18:32.180 --> 18:35.316
What are they?

18:35.350 --> 18:38.587
Well, uh...there's one
where you just got fired.

18:38.621 --> 18:39.955
And I play the boss
who comes to console you,

18:39.989 --> 18:43.125
but I end up fucking Marcy instead.

18:43.159 --> 18:44.927
Oh, yeah, and there's the one
that you play Charlie.

18:44.961 --> 18:47.362
And you just got the operation
to make your dick bigger--

18:48.964 --> 18:50.098
And I come to the hospital
and I see it...

18:50.132 --> 18:52.234
For the first time!

18:52.268 --> 18:53.502
Charlie, I know
it's very embarrassing,

18:53.536 --> 18:55.704
but you don't have to worry about it

18:55.738 --> 18:57.973
because you are having sex
with Lizzie.

18:58.008 --> 19:00.977
And this is fucking primo shit!

19:01.011 --> 19:02.646
I mean, right on, bro.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.782
Thank you, Stu.

19:04.816 --> 19:07.018
Lizzie, I'm sorry
about objectifying you there,

19:07.052 --> 19:08.119
but you're just way out of his league.

19:08.153 --> 19:09.320
No offense, Runkle.

19:09.354 --> 19:12.056
No, I get it,
she's totally out of my league.

19:12.090 --> 19:14.826
I'll take it as a compliment.

19:14.860 --> 19:18.029
Okay, so if you're all done
sucking each others' dicks,

19:18.064 --> 19:20.966
can we get back to the business
of firing Lizzie again?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.301
Okay, look.

19:22.335 --> 19:25.304
We only had sex after
you fired her the first time.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.206
Then you rehired her.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.875
It's very hard to put the toothpaste

19:28.909 --> 19:30.310
back in the tube, Marcy.

19:30.344 --> 19:33.814
Once it's out, it's just--
it--it...it's out.

19:33.848 --> 19:36.750
I didn't mean for it to happen, Marcy.

19:36.785 --> 19:37.751
It's just that
Charlie's been very kind

19:37.786 --> 19:40.020
during a very tough time in my life.

19:40.055 --> 19:41.355
Oh, has it been tough, darling?

19:41.390 --> 19:42.356
Okay, look--

19:42.391 --> 19:43.424
- Hey, come on!
- Hey, hey, look.

19:43.458 --> 19:46.394
Look, wait!
I have a suggestion.

19:46.428 --> 19:50.532
I think that we all feel
a sexual tension between us.

19:50.566 --> 19:52.034
What?

19:52.068 --> 19:54.303
Charlie is trying to work
his way into our sex life.

19:54.337 --> 19:56.771
He's even eroticized the very bed

19:56.806 --> 19:59.908
in which his ex-wife is now
sharing with her new husband.

19:59.943 --> 20:02.211
He's fucking his son's nanny,

20:02.245 --> 20:03.412
who happens to be young and beautiful,

20:03.447 --> 20:05.815
threatens and delights all
of us in some way.

20:05.849 --> 20:07.349
Okay, so what are you saying, Stuart?

20:07.384 --> 20:10.019
You want us all to have
a fucking orgy or something?

20:10.053 --> 20:12.555
You know, I was thinking
that we should all

20:12.589 --> 20:14.590
go and talk this out
with Dr. Lawson.

20:14.625 --> 20:16.292
But if you're thinking orgy,

20:16.327 --> 20:17.894
I am totally down with that.

20:19.196 --> 20:20.997
Fuckin' Jesus.

20:21.031 --> 20:23.233
Oh, God.

20:23.267 --> 20:26.435
Do you want me to go check
on him or am I fired?

20:33.310 --> 20:39.247
Well, if you think you can get
him to stop crying, yeah.

20:50.993 --> 20:53.261
Your moms are pretty cool.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.030
Yeah, they're all right.

20:55.064 --> 20:58.667
Want to talk about your script?

20:58.702 --> 21:00.703
Yeah, thanks for reading it, um...

21:00.737 --> 21:02.738
I have immense respect for you, Hank.

21:02.773 --> 21:04.941
I'm--I'm a huge fan.

21:04.975 --> 21:06.308
Then why are you such an immense prick

21:06.343 --> 21:07.710
around me all the time?

21:07.744 --> 21:09.211
Well, I didn't think you'd respect me

21:09.246 --> 21:11.580
if I was kissing your ass.

21:11.615 --> 21:12.648
That's a good call.

21:12.682 --> 21:14.049
But you--
I don't get it.

21:14.084 --> 21:15.584
You say you're a fan,
you want me to read your shit.

21:15.618 --> 21:16.952
And then you hand me a script

21:16.986 --> 21:18.620
that's about your relationship
with my daughter.

21:18.654 --> 21:21.122
It's kind of hard for me to be
objective about that, you know?

21:21.157 --> 21:23.892
Okay, look, when I found out
that you were Becca's dad...

21:23.927 --> 21:25.694
That's all it was about.

21:25.729 --> 21:28.397
I was like, "Sure, I'll take a
shot at Hank Moody's daughter."

21:28.431 --> 21:29.465
You know?

21:29.499 --> 21:32.234
How fucking cool would that be?

21:32.269 --> 21:33.435
I'm not proud of that, okay?

21:33.470 --> 21:37.072
But that's the brutal truth, right?

21:37.107 --> 21:38.841
I just thought, if
I hung around her long enough,

21:38.876 --> 21:42.513
that I'd get to meet you
at some point, you know?

21:42.547 --> 21:44.148
And the real kicker--

21:44.182 --> 21:47.885
and it's the truest part of
that whole fucking script--

21:47.919 --> 21:49.587
is I fell in love with her, Hank.

21:49.621 --> 21:52.023
Becca is amazing.

21:52.057 --> 21:53.758
I like to think so.

21:53.792 --> 21:56.060
She's the kind of girl
a guy meets when he's too young

21:56.094 --> 21:59.063
and he fucks up because there's
too much living left to do.

21:59.098 --> 22:01.733
So you're--you're gonna have to
forgive me for fucking up.

22:01.767 --> 22:03.100
Because...

22:03.135 --> 22:06.170
I'm trying my best to not make
that same mistake again.

22:11.344 --> 22:13.879
You ready for some notes?

22:13.913 --> 22:15.814
Yeah, absolutely, let's do it.

22:15.849 --> 22:17.082
You sure?

22:17.117 --> 22:19.084
Last kids I gave notes to
tried to off himself.

22:19.119 --> 22:22.756
No, I think I can handle it.

22:22.790 --> 22:24.057
All right.

22:24.091 --> 22:25.625
Page one.

22:25.660 --> 22:29.563
Why the fuck are you fading in?

22:40.575 --> 22:43.009
Okay.

22:43.044 --> 22:45.746
Maybe he's not all bad.

22:45.780 --> 22:48.281
He's not good or bad.

22:48.315 --> 22:50.317
He's a work in progress, I guess.

22:50.351 --> 22:51.551
Did you know he had two moms?

22:51.586 --> 22:52.619
Debbie and Lisa?

22:52.653 --> 22:53.786
Sure.

22:53.821 --> 22:55.455
Lisa asked me to be in
<i>The Big Book of Cocks.</i>

22:55.489 --> 22:56.756
The sequel.

22:56.791 --> 22:58.424
- Pictionary of penis.
- Okay, anything else?

22:58.459 --> 23:00.893
Yeah, actually.

23:00.928 --> 23:03.161
Um...

23:03.196 --> 23:07.432
It's just the whole
fucking parenting thing,

23:07.467 --> 23:09.100
it's not getting any easier.

23:09.135 --> 23:12.003
I just spent the afternoon
with a couple of dykes

23:12.037 --> 23:14.238
that know more about raising
a child than I ever will.

23:14.273 --> 23:17.175
You know what?

23:17.209 --> 23:20.545
I don't think you should be
so hard on yourself,

23:20.579 --> 23:22.347
'cause it's my job.

23:22.381 --> 23:25.817
It's like we made
this beautiful child,

23:25.852 --> 23:29.587
and I still don't know
what the fuck I'm doing.

23:29.621 --> 23:32.657
Maybe you should just...

23:32.691 --> 23:34.992
start enjoying her company, you know?

23:35.027 --> 23:36.761
Don't judge it so much.

23:36.795 --> 23:40.898
Maybe.

23:40.932 --> 23:44.034
By the way, it looks like
I owe you an apology.

23:44.068 --> 23:45.235
- What?
- I know.

23:45.269 --> 23:47.103
That sounds like
a foreign language to me.

23:47.138 --> 23:51.074
You owe me an apology?
Whatever for?

23:51.108 --> 23:55.812
Well, Richard came clean about
the whole stripper thing, and...

23:55.846 --> 23:57.680
he told me that you took
the fall for him.

23:57.714 --> 24:01.217
Yes, right, that.

24:01.251 --> 24:02.718
Why'd you do that?

24:02.753 --> 24:05.488
I figured you'd been through enough.

24:05.522 --> 24:11.494
I didn't want to see you hurt
if you didn't have to be.

24:17.502 --> 24:19.202
Thank you.
Thank you.

24:19.237 --> 24:22.506
Yep, we still got it.

24:22.541 --> 24:23.908
Shut up.

24:23.942 --> 24:26.144
You still thinking
about leaving Richard?

24:26.178 --> 24:27.145
Good night.

24:27.179 --> 24:28.847
Good night, now.

24:40.493 --> 24:43.396
What's up, Moody, huh?

24:43.430 --> 24:45.197
Jesus.

24:45.232 --> 24:46.899
What the fuck are you doing here?

24:46.933 --> 24:49.201
Where you been, man?

24:49.235 --> 24:51.103
What, you don't fucking
answer your phone no more?

24:51.137 --> 24:52.604
No, I don't, not when you call.

24:52.639 --> 24:54.539
You know why? 'Cause you only
call with fucking notes.

24:56.142 --> 24:58.276
How the fuck are you doing, Moody?

24:58.310 --> 24:59.343
Nero.

24:59.378 --> 25:00.511
Say my name, say my name again.

25:00.546 --> 25:02.913
Jesus, get off me.

25:02.948 --> 25:05.716
Whatever happened to just
a smile and a handshake

25:05.750 --> 25:06.950
every now and then,
you fucking psycho?

25:06.985 --> 25:08.485
Ah, what can I say?

25:08.520 --> 25:09.553
You got me
all hot and bothered, Moody.

25:09.587 --> 25:10.587
Good to see you.

25:10.621 --> 25:11.955
What the fuck are you doing here?

25:11.989 --> 25:13.423
I do have some notes on the script.

25:13.458 --> 25:17.195
Last time I checked,
you were not in the movie.

25:17.229 --> 25:19.030
He is now, motherfucker.

25:19.064 --> 25:21.232
Nero's gonna make this
fuckin' joint bulletproof, man.

25:21.266 --> 25:22.733
Sam's convinced me to do a cameo.

25:22.767 --> 25:24.335
And you are just the man to write it.

25:24.369 --> 25:26.104
With my own input, of course.

25:26.138 --> 25:28.072
Fine.

25:28.106 --> 25:31.309
But I'm not writing any
of that weird omnisexual shit

25:31.343 --> 25:32.910
about you taking a man
in your mouth, all right?

25:32.945 --> 25:34.245
Nah, nah, don't worry about that shit.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.047
No nut-guzzling shit
in my movie, yo.

25:36.082 --> 25:37.816
No, no, man, I'm over all that noise.

25:37.850 --> 25:39.150
That was last year.

25:39.185 --> 25:40.885
The year of living ambiguously.

25:40.920 --> 25:41.986
I'm celibate now.

25:42.021 --> 25:44.756
Okay. Why?

25:44.790 --> 25:47.192
A man can only shoot
so many loads in a lifetime.

25:47.227 --> 25:48.894
I mean, literally, you can run out.

25:48.928 --> 25:50.128
That's not medically true.

25:50.163 --> 25:53.098
No, it's true.
I've done the research.

25:53.133 --> 25:55.167
I have access
to the kind of medical science

25:55.202 --> 25:57.369
that civilians do not.

25:57.404 --> 25:58.570
My dick don't work no more.

25:58.605 --> 26:00.239
I mean, I haven't had an erection

26:00.273 --> 26:01.640
since last year's Golden Globes.

26:01.675 --> 26:02.808
Have you seen a doctor about that?

26:02.843 --> 26:04.243
Nah, I don't need to.
Don't want to.

26:04.277 --> 26:06.511
I've transcended sexuality.

26:06.546 --> 26:07.579
Moody, let's face it.

26:07.613 --> 26:10.014
I was put on this earth for a reason,

26:10.048 --> 26:12.483
to lead the way.
And I can see clearly now.

26:12.517 --> 26:18.321
Sex stands in the way
of true artistic achievement.

26:18.356 --> 26:20.590
I want to be the first film actor

26:20.624 --> 26:21.958
to have his genitals removed.

26:21.992 --> 26:23.626
Can you imagine
what that would be like?

26:23.660 --> 26:25.227
To be completely dickless?

26:25.262 --> 26:29.532
To be a smooth, hairless,
real life action figure?

26:29.566 --> 26:31.333
Like a Ken doll,
or a high-powered eunuch.

26:31.367 --> 26:35.770
Can you even comprehend what
I would be able to accomplish

26:35.805 --> 26:37.773
without the distraction of sex?

26:37.807 --> 26:39.608
Looking for a doctor
to help me with this.

26:39.642 --> 26:41.577
It's been a little challenging.

26:41.611 --> 26:43.045
I may have to go underground.

26:43.079 --> 26:44.079
Or to Europe.

26:44.114 --> 26:46.115
Jesus fuck, I'm nauseous.

26:46.150 --> 26:48.184
Oh, get out your laptop.

26:48.218 --> 26:50.653
I feel a monologue coming on.

26:50.687 --> 26:54.424
My character...

26:54.458 --> 26:58.962
is a grizzled LAPD detective

26:58.996 --> 27:00.964
who's confined to a wheelchair.

27:00.999 --> 27:03.100
He's addicted to painkillers.

27:03.134 --> 27:04.702
He hates black people.

27:04.736 --> 27:05.770
But he loves America.
You know what I'm saying?

27:05.804 --> 27:07.038
No.

27:07.072 --> 27:08.706
You're not feeling
this fuckin' shit, man?

27:08.740 --> 27:11.476
This motherfucker's
droppin' bombs, man.

27:11.510 --> 27:13.644
All over the fucking place, man.

27:13.679 --> 27:15.946
This is gonna be hot.

27:15.981 --> 27:18.949
Get your fucking laptop.

27:18.983 --> 27:20.617
Go ahead, put it in my mouth.

27:20.651 --> 27:22.652
Come on, honey, do it to me,
put it around my neck.

27:22.686 --> 27:24.053
That's it--

27:24.088 --> 27:25.321
You cannot quiet me!

27:29.259 --> 27:30.360
Jesus, Eddie.

27:30.394 --> 27:31.694
What the fuck are you
doing up so early?

27:31.729 --> 27:34.063
Up? I didn't go to sleep.

27:34.097 --> 27:35.731
I don't need it.

27:35.766 --> 27:37.333
Right, because
you're a superior being.

27:37.367 --> 27:38.401
No, it's not that.

27:38.435 --> 27:40.771
That's elitist.

27:40.805 --> 27:43.273
But I do think I'm the
next step in human evolution.

27:43.308 --> 27:44.909
Sure, I buy it.

27:44.943 --> 27:46.777
And I think I found my next movie.

27:46.812 --> 27:48.479
Good for you, Edward.

27:48.513 --> 27:49.680
Good for you.

27:49.715 --> 27:51.716
The writing.
The writing!

27:51.750 --> 27:53.251
Reminds me of you.

27:53.285 --> 27:55.786
<i>Fucking & Punching,</i>
but for the Twitter generation.

27:55.820 --> 27:59.456
Much more youthful.
Vital and alive and...

27:59.490 --> 28:02.359
This shit is fuckin' raw.
