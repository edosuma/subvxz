00:01.960 --> 00:03.564
<i>Previously
on</i> Justified...

00:06.760 --> 00:07.761
Mikey!

00:12.440 --> 00:14.010
Your lady friend is dead.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.328
Went pretty badly,
as I understand it,

00:16.400 --> 00:18.971
in the confines of a motor
coach belonging to Wynn Duffy.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.320
Baby?

00:21.920 --> 00:24.002
What disappoints you,
Raylan Givens?

00:24.080 --> 00:26.128
The fact that you weren't the
one who got to shoot me?

00:26.200 --> 00:27.440
Where's she goin?

00:28.400 --> 00:30.846
You wheel me out of here,
I'll take you straight to her.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.047
That's funny.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.282
Sooner or later, one way or the
other, I'm gonna get out of here.

00:35.360 --> 00:36.930
And when I do,

00:37.400 --> 00:38.640
I'm gonna go get that money.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.882
<i>Now this Grubes guy
we're going to see,</i>

00:40.960 --> 00:42.041
<i>you sure he knows
his way around?</i>

00:42.120 --> 00:43.645
<i>He knows the
trails blindfolded.</i>

00:43.720 --> 00:45.722
Boyd knows Grubes,
and if he's alive...

00:45.800 --> 00:47.609
If he's alive,
the Marshals got him,

00:47.680 --> 00:49.170
and if he ain't,
the more the better.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.240
Grubes?

00:53.320 --> 00:54.685
No!

00:54.760 --> 00:56.524
How are we gonna get you out
past the nurses' stand

00:56.600 --> 00:57.647
without anybody noticing?

00:57.720 --> 00:59.760
It shouldn't be too
hard with all the chaos.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.291
What chaos?

01:02.800 --> 01:04.529
<i>You got 48 hours,
Raylan.</i>

01:04.599 --> 01:06.568
48 hours, bullshit.

01:06.640 --> 01:09.211
Who you got coming after me?
Everybody?

01:09.280 --> 01:10.884
<i>Everybody's out
looking for Boyd.</i>

01:10.960 --> 01:13.008
I'll be the one
coming after you.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.771
Evening, sir.
Where you headed tonight?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.047
I'm headed home.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.363
- You got any kin waiting on you?
- No, sir, I don't.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.801
That won't be necessary.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.602
Well, what can I
do for you, officer?

01:45.680 --> 01:47.364
You can give me a ride.

02:01.440 --> 02:03.568
- This the shitbag?
- It is.

02:03.680 --> 02:04.727
Hello, shitbag.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.371
Him there's the good news.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.005
I don't want to
hear the bad news.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.570
No, sir, you do not.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.168
Jesus Christ. Raylan.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.889
Don't suppose you
remember my name.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.205
I remember you had aim to
throw me down a mine shaft.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.642
You're a long way from home,
are you not?

02:44.720 --> 02:48.281
I am. Slurry pond
fouled the spring.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.567
No water on the other side
of the mountain.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.723
No water, nothing to hunt.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.081
Well, I reckon it was
hard to move on. Was.

02:55.920 --> 02:59.129
They'll take the mountain top
year's end, I heard.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.408
I had to move on, regardless.

03:04.640 --> 03:07.610
- Wouldn't mind if you sat a spell.
- I got urgent matters.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.401
My advice,

03:10.160 --> 03:11.525
keep moving on.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.888
There's a fugitive
at large hereabouts.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.328
Give my best to Cousin Mary
if you see her.

03:17.880 --> 03:18.881
She passed.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.327
Condolences. Stand up.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.443
Tell 'em to come out,
guns pointed at the ground.

03:35.280 --> 03:38.045
If that ain't all of them, you're
the first one who'll get shot.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.610
That's all of 'em.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.404
Lay your guns down.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.966
Every second I spend
on your bullshit,

03:49.080 --> 03:51.367
the man I'm hunting
gets further away.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.841
Now tell 'em to do it
before I lose my temper.

04:01.640 --> 04:05.884
Now, walk down that hill. And
keep walking, about an hour.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.611
He'll catch up with you soon,

04:07.680 --> 04:10.160
if he don't do something stupid.

04:11.840 --> 04:16.767
No sign. I bet they ran off
after Grubes died.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.444
I'ma bet they starved to death.

04:18.519 --> 04:21.887
We got no guide, and you're
worried about the horses?

04:22.000 --> 04:25.686
That's one bad omen on top of another.
I ain't superstitious.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.762
Doesn't take a damn
Ouija board to see

04:27.840 --> 04:31.526
that our plan is as dead as the man
that used to live in that house.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.763
You'd notice if you weren't
playing in the dirt.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.410
I'm digging a grave.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.084
For us, huh?

04:39.080 --> 04:42.402
Uncle Zachariah,
we gotta get out of here.

04:42.520 --> 04:44.568
Oh, is that the way it is?

04:44.680 --> 04:45.806
Leave the dead
to bury their own.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.560
That's something you learnt
from Boyd, huh?

04:48.920 --> 04:50.570
You don't know me.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.449
You want to be
all high and mighty?

04:52.560 --> 04:53.891
Let's see how
that saves your ass.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.440
I know you don't wanna hear me
preach, but I'ma tell you right now,

04:56.520 --> 04:58.249
there's six months'
worth of food in that cabin,

04:58.360 --> 05:00.806
plenty of water, lot of
firewood for the cold.

05:01.600 --> 05:02.965
If that's your idea of a plan...

05:03.040 --> 05:04.405
Oh, no, little girl,
I like your idea.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.160
We just run around
these goddamn mountains,

05:06.240 --> 05:08.163
not knowing what the hell
we're doing, lost,

05:08.720 --> 05:11.291
hauling 300, 400,
500 pounds of money!

05:11.360 --> 05:13.010
Oh, you're real smart, girl!

05:14.080 --> 05:16.811
- I can't keep this up.
- Yes, you can, and you will.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.005
'Cause that's who we are,

05:19.080 --> 05:23.085
born into the godforsaken hollers
in this goddamn broken-down world.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.890
We're survivors.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.925
Okay. You wanna stay?
We can stay.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.765
But we're gonna fight.
Won't have to fight.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.605
After two weeks, they'll think
we're somewhere over in Virginia.

05:34.680 --> 05:37.047
They'll just move that
search on over there.

05:37.280 --> 05:40.807
I'm talking about Boyd. He knows
this place. He will come.

05:40.880 --> 05:43.804
Boyd is dead. And if he
ain't dead, he's in jail.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.080
We'll be safe here for a while.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.040
Now grab that shovel and help
me get this man in the ground.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.443
I don't see any badge.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.004
Are you still a Federal?

05:59.080 --> 06:01.765
This guy you're chasing,
he personal business?

06:01.880 --> 06:05.009
You've met him. You put
me in a box with him.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.889
He's now a federal fugitive.

06:06.960 --> 06:08.928
So you should've let me kill
him at the time, then, huh?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.685
- The though thas crossed my mind.
- So, I'm right.

06:11.760 --> 06:13.649
Gotta be you
the one that does him.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.970
You know, I had a coyote like that.
Ate near 10 of my chickens.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.682
One every night.
Dogs couldn't catch her.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.842
Avoided the traps like
she set 'em herself.

06:22.960 --> 06:25.640
- You know, what I decided to do was...
- I don't care what you did.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.524
I need you to shut your mouth
and get up that hill.

06:29.240 --> 06:33.290
You know, after we tangled, Cousin
Mary told us all about you.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.681
Turns out I remember your daddy.
He's a son of a bitch.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.570
You'll get no argument there.

06:37.640 --> 06:41.361
- You know what he did?
- Historically or on a specific day?

06:41.800 --> 06:43.643
He used us.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.484
He used our blood ties
to your mama,

06:45.560 --> 06:48.131
to have us move his drugs
up and down our mountain.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.929
The way you're
moving me right now.

06:50.400 --> 06:53.165
The way I see it, that makes
you a son of a bitch, too.

06:53.520 --> 06:54.600
Guilty as charged.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.006
I let you go,

07:04.360 --> 07:06.681
you gonna get your people,
come back after me?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.570
You got any good reason
why I shouldn't?

07:08.840 --> 07:11.923
- With what purpose in mind?
- You saw 'em. They got nothing.

07:12.440 --> 07:14.602
They'll kill you for your boots.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.081
Give me that.

07:22.320 --> 07:25.005
In a couple of days, you're gonna
come to Arlo Givens' place,

07:25.080 --> 07:27.003
he's in the book.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.491
I'm signing it over to you.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.847
You're giving me your house?

07:31.920 --> 07:35.811
He did you people dirt.
This is payback.

07:36.360 --> 07:39.330
I been using that place
as a bullshit excuse.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.084
I don't need the money
from selling it.

07:41.160 --> 07:44.448
I need to find Boyd
and get to Florida.

07:52.600 --> 07:53.601
What's this?

07:53.880 --> 07:57.965
A note bequeathing
the property to you.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.208
In case I don't make it down.

08:45.320 --> 08:48.051
I always scoffed
at people talking

08:49.440 --> 08:51.488
to loved ones who'd moved on.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.167
Seemed impractical to me.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.485
Can't hear you.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.451
They're gone.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.689
And I'm a practical man.

09:07.800 --> 09:11.122
Except when it comes to you,
it seems.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.969
Revenge, Katherine,

09:17.640 --> 09:19.642
what did you in.

09:22.280 --> 09:25.489
Damn it, I told you
I would get Duffy.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.244
Why didn't you trust me?

09:32.600 --> 09:36.844
For once, why couldn't you just
do what you were told to do?

09:47.680 --> 09:50.160
I'll always love you, Katherine.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.129
But you need to know,

09:52.200 --> 09:56.444
I may be talking to a ghost, but
I am still a practical man.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.482
I'd love to gut Wynn Duffy
from nose to tail,

10:02.720 --> 10:07.009
but I have got to go
and get my goddamn money.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.045
Wynn Duffy.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.687
Now, you've got
a damn good lawyer, Wynn.

10:20.760 --> 10:23.604
And I ought to know, because
I'm a damn good lawyer.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.569
I'll pass along the adulation.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.567
Are these the personal items
from my motor coach?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.570
Yeah, I had to call in a
lot of favors

10:32.640 --> 10:34.563
to get you transferred
to Federal custody.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.085
And now...

10:36.160 --> 10:39.767
Well, it seems now
I've got to let you go.

10:41.080 --> 10:43.401
Billie Jean King.
A pioneer.

10:45.080 --> 10:48.527
We took the liberty to
freeze your bank accounts.

10:51.520 --> 10:54.683
It's prescription.
I have sensitive gums.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.363
Pending the results of the
investigation, you're fully cleared.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.770
Should be able to get
most of your assets off ice.

11:01.920 --> 11:02.921
Oh, look at this.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.490
You were an Eagle Scout?

11:05.760 --> 11:07.524
It belonged to a dear friend.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.601
Mmm.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.650
Of course KSP's gonna wanna keep
your Winnebago a bit longer,

11:11.760 --> 11:13.683
but if you want that, you can
stick around for a week or two.

11:13.760 --> 11:14.886
That they can have.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.924
Bad memories?

11:17.720 --> 11:20.769
Raylan Givens, Boyd Crowder,
and Avery Markham

11:20.840 --> 11:23.207
are soon to converge,
Mr. Vasquez.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.281
Like the aligning
of the planets,

11:24.360 --> 11:27.762
if those planets carried guns
and hated my guts.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.966
I don't ever plan on
returning to Kentucky.

11:32.600 --> 11:33.601
May I?

11:39.480 --> 11:40.970
I just have one last question.

11:41.440 --> 11:42.680
You know, for me.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.207
Off the record.
Sounds sexy.

11:46.280 --> 11:49.648
You know, I have a stack
of files, this tall.

11:49.720 --> 11:53.725
It sits on my desk. It's got all
kinds of witness interrogation,

11:54.200 --> 11:58.125
and surveillance records
and info from snitches

11:58.320 --> 12:01.722
about who killed Simon Poole
14 years ago,

12:01.800 --> 12:04.087
and it all adds up to

12:04.680 --> 12:06.489
jack shit.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.243
So, I just want to know,
between you and me,

12:11.320 --> 12:13.322
who really did it?

12:13.400 --> 12:14.845
Who killed my boss?

12:17.120 --> 12:20.203
Between you and me,
Mr. Vasquez,

12:20.280 --> 12:22.886
I really and truly don't know.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.923
<i>Air unit East to Evarts.</i>

12:34.000 --> 12:36.571
<i>Possible fugitive sighting.
Please confirm, over.</i>

12:37.440 --> 12:39.442
<i>Copy,
which fugitive? Over.</i>

12:39.520 --> 12:43.366
<i>Boyd Crowder. Possibly in
police uniform, considered armed.</i>

12:43.560 --> 12:46.609
<i>Stolen police vehicle recovered.
Possible hostage situation.</i>

12:46.680 --> 12:48.205
God damn.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.164
Of course.

12:52.360 --> 12:53.691
Of course!

12:56.360 --> 12:58.647
The hell are you laughing about?
It's a joke.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.444
Don't you get it?
We're dead!

13:03.720 --> 13:04.881
No. We gotta do something.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.042
We're gonna run.
Hell, yeah, let's run.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.520
You know your way around this
goddamn mountain, little girl?

13:09.600 --> 13:12.649
'Cause I sure as hell don't.
Just forget about the mountain.

13:12.720 --> 13:16.281
We gotta go back down.
We gotta, I don't know,

13:16.360 --> 13:18.840
find one of them abandoned
houses and then hide out.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.251
The Federals kicking
in every goddamn door

13:20.360 --> 13:21.930
dogs runnin' around,
sniffing around,

13:22.000 --> 13:23.080
they'll find us in no time.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.249
You got a better idea?
Else we're dead.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.403
Yeah, I got an idea.

13:30.480 --> 13:33.484
We gonna sit right here
and we gonna wait.

13:33.560 --> 13:36.325
When he shows up,
we gonna kill him.

13:37.240 --> 13:40.244
- The end.
- That's not gonna be our end.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.571
'Cause staying here is suicide.

13:45.560 --> 13:48.484
I'm gonna need you
for a little while longer.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.881
I'd rather take your time
than take your truck.

13:51.960 --> 13:53.405
You can have her.

13:54.320 --> 13:55.651
Yeah, well,

13:56.720 --> 13:58.131
I don't want her.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.242
I'm just looking to get
from point A to point B.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.808
Look, Mr. Crowder,

14:04.120 --> 14:06.282
I done helped you out.
I gave you my son's clothes.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.324
You know my name,
you know what I've done.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.249
Goddamn right, I know your name,

14:11.320 --> 14:12.731
and which time
you talking about?

14:12.760 --> 14:15.286
- Well, I do have a rather long résumé.
- Yes, sir.

14:15.360 --> 14:18.284
They put out your greatest
hits, it'd be a double album.

14:18.360 --> 14:19.441
Shit!

14:19.560 --> 14:21.722
Double live, man, from Japan.

14:21.880 --> 14:25.009
Hell, yeah. All killer, no filler.

14:25.640 --> 14:28.291
<i>Konnichiwa,</i> bitches.

14:28.360 --> 14:31.807
Shit. You're the nearest thing we
got to Billy the Kid around here.

14:32.320 --> 14:33.560
I don't know about all that.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.723
Shit, son, you smart,
articulate, strong.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.166
The way you look,
the way you talk,

14:38.240 --> 14:41.005
ain't nobody expect
nothing from you.

14:41.080 --> 14:44.084
Then you unleash
and they cannot deny.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.967
Ain't too much
to call you a hero.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.963
Well, if you insist.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.002
Go on.

14:54.120 --> 14:58.011
Be proud to give the outlaw
Boyd Crowder my truck.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.848
The thing is,
they're looking for me,

15:05.880 --> 15:07.803
they ain't looking for you.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.569
So I'm gonna need you to drive.

15:13.880 --> 15:17.168
Man, this sucks.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.641
I ain't paying you
to whine.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.770
Yeah?

15:22.320 --> 15:24.368
And I didn't come for the money.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.249
Well, not just the money.

15:31.720 --> 15:35.247
Look, I got people maybe
out to kill me, Derrick.

15:35.640 --> 15:38.769
You came just to get back
together, you're a damn fool.

15:38.840 --> 15:41.161
Loretta, why you gotta be so...

15:42.560 --> 15:43.561
Got him!

15:44.240 --> 15:45.480
Hold up.

15:46.400 --> 15:49.563
I can't see.
Here. Let me look.

15:50.560 --> 15:51.971
Hey, Loretta.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.369
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.803
You know, one way in
and out of this place.

15:56.880 --> 16:00.885
I snap one of your traps and you
both take your eyes off the door?

16:00.960 --> 16:04.248
You're a smart girl, but I got a
thing or two to teach you, yet.

16:04.520 --> 16:08.161
I reckon I could see you both
better if you stepped out this way.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.766
Yes, you, son. Come on, now.
Giddy up.

16:15.880 --> 16:17.803
How 'bout you
put down them toys.

16:17.880 --> 16:19.609
I'm not here to start a ruckus.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.404
Who the hell are you?

16:27.720 --> 16:29.165
Just her boyfriend.

16:29.240 --> 16:32.005
Oh, yeah? You want to
save your girlfriend?

16:32.080 --> 16:33.605
He ain't
my boyfriend.

16:33.720 --> 16:36.291
Loretta, girl, a boy
doesn't become a man

16:36.960 --> 16:38.962
until he can make
his own decisions.

16:39.280 --> 16:42.204
You want to raise up that
gun, try and shoot me?

16:42.280 --> 16:43.930
Are you afraid I'm too fast?

16:44.720 --> 16:46.324
I am, by the way.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.802
Good news, Jenny here,

16:49.880 --> 16:52.247
you gotta leave her
firing chamber empty,

16:52.320 --> 16:54.641
avoid an accidental discharge.

16:54.720 --> 16:58.042
Bad news, her chamber's
full of promise now.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.283
How about we
try that again, huh?

17:01.160 --> 17:02.685
You not having to
clear that holster,

17:02.760 --> 17:04.523
boy, that fast approach
is a fair...

17:12.440 --> 17:13.441
Oh, shit.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.564
He's still kicking.

17:16.400 --> 17:20.450
That's the risk you run going
for a head shot, Loretta.

17:21.359 --> 17:22.849
But I figure,

17:24.359 --> 17:28.569
you never know when one of these
pussies are wearing Kevlar, right.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.325
Always go for the brain.
Best bet.

17:40.680 --> 17:42.967
Don't worry.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.684
I forgive you.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.649
Where is he?
Where's Art?

17:52.720 --> 17:54.640
Who's running this shit show?
Where is everybody?

17:54.680 --> 17:57.411
Gee, I don't know,
the manhunts? Plural?

17:57.480 --> 17:59.960
And they left you to what,
do your nails?

18:00.040 --> 18:03.408
Well, if it's any of your business,
Vasquez, I'm coordinating.

18:03.480 --> 18:04.447
Oh, well, that's fantastic.

18:04.560 --> 18:08.087
Maybe you can coordinate an explanation
of this bullshit bulletin.

18:11.560 --> 18:13.767
Chief called it in,
it looks pretty serious.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.681
You were saying?

18:20.200 --> 18:22.362
Having a bad day, David?
Yeah.

18:22.440 --> 18:23.960
Hey, Tim, maybe
you can help...

18:24.040 --> 18:25.451
Dude, I just came in.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.488
He's asking about
the bulletin.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.440
Well,

18:35.400 --> 18:36.811
when a Marshal's life
is in danger,

18:36.880 --> 18:38.769
we put out a bulletin saying so.

18:41.360 --> 18:44.250
Hoping a fellow LEO will bring
him into protective custody.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.402
You think I don't know
that Givens has gone rogue,

18:46.520 --> 18:49.603
and that you're closing ranks
to avoid a PR nightmare?

18:49.720 --> 18:52.644
You and everybody in this office

18:52.720 --> 18:54.484
is gonna be writing thank
you notes to Art Mullen

18:54.560 --> 18:55.641
from the Federal Penitentiary.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.165
Your attitude
is not helpful.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.851
Open your ears!
So negative.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.888
We're not talking
about a write-up.

19:03.040 --> 19:07.443
Everybody in here is an accessory
to a $10 million heist,

19:08.400 --> 19:10.971
aiding and abetting a fugitive.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.489
Never mind.
There's no point.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.727
Get me SAC Lester
LeVay at the FBI.

19:23.840 --> 19:26.081
- Oh, hey, Art, what's up?
<i>- Hold on, you're breaking up.</i>

19:26.160 --> 19:28.367
Let me see if I can
get a signal.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.805
- Say that again.
<i>- Oh, hey, Art, what's up?</i>

19:32.440 --> 19:36.126
Oh, you know, scouring the
countryside for dumbass. You?

19:36.400 --> 19:39.290
Well, I just had Vasquez pissing
in my ear about the bulletin.

19:39.360 --> 19:40.691
So, looks like we can't keep

19:40.760 --> 19:44.003
the whole Raylan-Givens-
gone-rogue thing in-house.

19:44.120 --> 19:46.248
<i>Well, he sniffed it out
sooner than I'd thought.</i>

19:46.320 --> 19:48.607
I think he just trashed
Nelson's desk, too.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.125
Well, how'd you leave it?

19:50.280 --> 19:51.441
Well, he's on the phone now.

19:51.760 --> 19:54.081
Yeah, I'm gonna need a BOLO
issued for Raylan Givens.

19:54.160 --> 19:57.687
Fact, I just heard him tell the
FBI ballsack to issue a BOLO.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.967
Well, shit.
Wait one.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.282
The plan is, as soon as I get
him, I'm gonna indict him.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.362
I just heard him say
he wants Raylan indicted.

20:05.440 --> 20:06.680
Double shit.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.529
Raylan, if you get this,

20:10.400 --> 20:13.722
I want you to know I heard the
FBI BOLO for you on the scanner.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.564
I know you're in trouble.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.365
I'm on my way.

20:20.200 --> 20:23.124
Raylan, did you steal
my Crown Vic?

20:24.480 --> 20:25.641
Shit!

20:34.560 --> 20:36.767
All right.
Where are you?

20:38.640 --> 20:39.801
Shit. There you are.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.844
I'm coming for you, Raylan.

21:05.520 --> 21:07.648
You ain't Boyd.
Neither are you.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.444
Appreciate you not shooting me.

21:13.360 --> 21:14.566
Likewise.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.440
Seen the crown of your hat
through the window.

21:17.480 --> 21:18.720
Boyd don't wear no hat.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.491
Where's Ava?

21:29.600 --> 21:32.365
If you get this,
call this number.

21:33.040 --> 21:34.201
You better make it fast, though,

21:34.280 --> 21:36.362
I'm running out of time.

21:58.960 --> 22:01.611
I need a vehicle, a gun,
and two passports.

22:02.080 --> 22:05.163
I want the vehicle to have a
compartment, well-hidden.

22:05.240 --> 22:08.244
And I mean top-shelf hidden,

22:08.320 --> 22:10.800
not some 20-year-old Astro
with a false bottom.

22:11.640 --> 22:13.369
How much space you need?

22:14.080 --> 22:17.926
Enough room for two or three
very large duffel bags.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.170
Your guy coming, too?

22:21.920 --> 22:23.922
No, Mikey's not going
to make it.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.485
You know what would be great?

22:31.280 --> 22:33.760
One of those dog grooming vans.

22:34.640 --> 22:37.007
Mobile dog groomers use them.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.368
We can paint one
up like that, sure.

22:40.440 --> 22:41.566
No,

22:42.600 --> 22:43.647
a used one.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.969
That's not easy.

22:48.040 --> 22:49.201
By tomorrow.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.201
Triple what you paid last time.

22:56.280 --> 22:59.011
- Fine.
- Upfront.

23:18.360 --> 23:19.805
Keep the change.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.925
Anything else?

23:24.600 --> 23:26.125
Yeah, actually,

23:27.520 --> 23:31.161
a topographical map of Harlan
County would be great.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.608
Do you not see how
we want the same thing?

23:35.680 --> 23:36.681
That may be true,

23:36.760 --> 23:37.761
but if Boyd ain't been here yet,

23:37.840 --> 23:38.921
why you goin' off
looking for Ava?

23:39.000 --> 23:40.047
Why don't you just stay here,

23:40.120 --> 23:41.610
and we'll take that
son of a bitch together?

23:41.680 --> 23:44.081
We don't know for sure
if he's coming.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.162
He's only coming
if he thinks she's here.

23:46.240 --> 23:47.480
And he does think she's here.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.601
But if he don't,

23:48.680 --> 23:50.760
if he somehow gets wind of
her before I get to him...

23:51.360 --> 23:54.250
I hear what you're saying, but
I'm sticking here for the fight.

23:54.320 --> 23:57.403
Well, I'm taking the fight to him.
Now where is she?

23:57.480 --> 24:00.131
I don't know. Maybe she slipped
through Cranks Gap by now,

24:00.200 --> 24:01.611
she might even be
halfway to Jonesville,

24:01.680 --> 24:03.045
or maybe Ewing, I don't know.

24:03.760 --> 24:06.161
Who does she know in Virginia?
Did you set her up?

24:06.680 --> 24:08.523
I don't know nobody in Virginia.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.682
I don't know where she is
and she didn't tell me.

24:10.800 --> 24:13.400
So I can't spill my guts in case
you plan on roughing me up again.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.565
You're a waste of space.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.405
You're of no help.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.802
Let me tell you something,
you son of a bitch!

24:19.880 --> 24:22.724
You ain't no better than Boyd.
God damn you!

24:22.800 --> 24:25.246
The way the two of you just
scramble that poor girl's brains,

24:25.320 --> 24:26.970
pulling her this way
and that way.

24:27.040 --> 24:29.520
You used her, God damn you!

24:29.600 --> 24:31.967
Ain't no wonder why she
burned the two of you

24:32.040 --> 24:33.485
and lit out on her own.

24:33.560 --> 24:35.164
I'm trying to protect her.

24:35.240 --> 24:36.287
Yeah, that may be
a part of the story,

24:36.360 --> 24:38.488
but I bet that ain't
the whole goddamn story.

24:38.560 --> 24:42.121
Yeah, you're goddamn right.
Where's the money?

24:42.200 --> 24:44.441
Where is it?
It ain't here.

24:44.560 --> 24:47.404
It had to weigh a ton. No way
she drug it up and over.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.330
She went down.

24:51.760 --> 24:54.889
She gone. Not as
long as I'm looking.

25:08.200 --> 25:11.283
Ava Crowder! Step
away from the car.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.328
Step away from my Crown Vic.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.328
Take that backpack off.
Slow.

25:24.840 --> 25:27.161
Don't reach into... Put it on the ground.
On the ground.

25:28.600 --> 25:31.888
Ava, don't test me. All right.
Now get down on your knees.

25:32.760 --> 25:34.125
On your knees.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.964
I'm sorry if that sounds
untoward.

25:41.560 --> 25:44.609
Holy shit. Holy shit.

25:46.800 --> 25:49.167
- Where's Raylan?
- I don't know.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.487
- Did you kill him?
- What? No!

25:52.000 --> 25:55.447
Ava, you're a fugitive from the
law, I know you shot your fiancé,

25:55.720 --> 25:58.963
and I know that Raylan took my Crown
Vic and I tracked it up here.

25:59.080 --> 26:02.368
- Now, for the last time...
- The answer to the question is no!

26:02.480 --> 26:04.084
I ain't even seen him.

26:04.840 --> 26:06.444
I hope for your sake,

26:06.520 --> 26:08.761
and for the sake of
the Commonwealth of Kentucky,

26:08.840 --> 26:10.040
that you are telling the truth.

26:12.640 --> 26:15.484
Now, lace your fingers behind
your head, behind your head.

26:18.080 --> 26:22.244
Okay. Let's get up slowly.
Come on.

26:22.320 --> 26:25.130
There you go.
Now walk this way with me.

26:25.200 --> 26:28.170
And I'm quick with this gun, in case
you getting squirrelly, you got that?

26:28.240 --> 26:29.685
Bob,

26:29.760 --> 26:32.445
you know there's a lot more money
where that came from, don't you?

26:32.520 --> 26:34.921
- I mean...
- I'm gonna take mercy on you.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.081
I'm not going to add

26:36.160 --> 26:39.209
attempting to bribe an officer of the
law into your long list of offenses.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.520
And before you try to seduce me,

26:40.600 --> 26:42.284
just know it's been
tried before.

26:42.760 --> 26:43.761
All right, now.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.922
Get yourself in the Gremlin there.
Open the door.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.610
Open the door.

26:48.360 --> 26:50.567
All right.
Sit yourself down.

26:51.560 --> 26:55.201
And when Raylan comes back with
my keys, we'll make the change.

26:55.320 --> 26:56.651
And it's nice in there.
I got an air-freshener

26:56.760 --> 26:58.046
that smells like a mocha latte.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.810
- You hear that?
- No, I... Yes, I did.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.041
It's Boyd.

27:14.360 --> 27:17.204
That could be anybody, okay? I
want you to calm down, all right?

27:17.360 --> 27:20.125
Just calm down. Just sit down for a sec.
Listen to me, please.

27:20.240 --> 27:21.730
He's gonna kill us.

27:27.320 --> 27:28.685
Cold out here.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.045
I can feel it.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.721
Yeah, I was just thinking
the same thing.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.402
I appreciate
the lie, Mr. Crowder,

27:42.760 --> 27:45.240
but we both know
what you was thinking.

27:46.280 --> 27:47.691
Loose ends and all.

27:48.240 --> 27:50.083
You know my mind?

27:50.840 --> 27:54.606
Maybe I was gonna take
your keys, let you walk.

27:55.680 --> 27:57.440
So you could
shoot me in the back?

27:57.560 --> 28:00.325
You're gonna have to look me in
the eye, you pull that trigger.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.922
No. I knew the minute
you stepped in my cab,

28:05.240 --> 28:07.400
I was gonna be staring down
the black hole of your gun.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.886
Cut me down
like the plague you are.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.840
Well, I gotta say,
you did do a pretty good job

28:11.880 --> 28:14.247
all that
smoke blowing up my ass.

28:14.320 --> 28:15.731
Ain't no smoke.

28:16.440 --> 28:17.885
But I will say this.

28:19.440 --> 28:21.283
Stories about outlaw legends,

28:21.360 --> 28:23.283
they ain't passed down by the
families of the murdered.

28:23.360 --> 28:26.364
I don't give a shit about
<i>The Ballad Of Boyd Crowder.</i>

28:26.440 --> 28:29.410
I'll be dead and gone
that song gets sung.

28:34.440 --> 28:37.808
Hobo by the name of Hut
McKean mean anything to you?

28:40.120 --> 28:42.248
Let me guess, I killed him,

28:43.480 --> 28:47.451
or my men killed him,
my dope killed him,

28:47.520 --> 28:49.443
or my daddy killed him.

28:50.240 --> 28:51.651
Next thing that
comes out of your mouth is,

28:51.720 --> 28:54.326
"How do you sleep at night,
Boyd Crowder?"

28:55.840 --> 28:59.970
Well, do you know how?
'Cause I know who I am.

29:00.040 --> 29:01.485
Do you?

29:01.680 --> 29:05.730
You're a slave. Disenfranchised,
don't even know it.

29:05.800 --> 29:08.929
You drive your shitty truck
to your shitty house,

29:09.000 --> 29:10.843
live out your shitty life.

29:11.640 --> 29:13.847
You think you're better than me
'cause you play by the rules?

29:13.920 --> 29:15.126
Whose rules?

29:15.720 --> 29:17.848
My life is my own.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.131
You ain't even heard
a word I said.

29:23.240 --> 29:26.722
I don't give a shit
about what you said.

29:30.120 --> 29:31.485
I'm an outlaw.

29:36.160 --> 29:39.403
Stay here. Don't make any noise.
No. No, no.

29:42.160 --> 29:43.161
Bob!

29:43.880 --> 29:45.484
You can't leave me
here like this.

31:01.520 --> 31:02.726
Goddamn, Raylan!

31:03.640 --> 31:07.087
How you know I wasn't some Boy
Scout looking for his tent?

31:07.160 --> 31:08.969
Your teeth
glow in the dark.

31:09.080 --> 31:10.969
You shot unprovoked.

31:11.640 --> 31:13.529
How am I supposed to take that?

31:13.640 --> 31:15.961
As me aiming to kill you.

31:22.840 --> 31:25.923
Well, it's only getting colder.

31:26.480 --> 31:30.565
So what say, the next time the moon
peeks out from behind those clouds,

31:31.480 --> 31:32.811
we show it down?

31:35.320 --> 31:36.890
Now you're talking.

31:36.960 --> 31:38.610
Only problem is, Raylan,

31:39.720 --> 31:41.006
I don't know where you are.

31:43.080 --> 31:44.640
I don't know
where I am, either.

31:51.360 --> 31:53.966
Why do you even wanna
kill me so bad, Raylan?

31:54.960 --> 31:59.284
You don't even know why.
"Boyd Crowder must die!"

32:00.000 --> 32:03.447
That's just a lie you tell
yourself for wanting to win.

32:06.600 --> 32:09.888
You are the world-conquering
Emperor of Lies,

32:09.960 --> 32:12.486
the biggest reserved
for yourself.

32:12.560 --> 32:16.246
Just say it, Raylan.
"I want to win!"

32:17.800 --> 32:20.531
How about, "I want the money"?

32:20.840 --> 32:23.730
Shit. You want
to kill her, Boyd.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.802
You want to kill the woman
who stole your money,

32:25.920 --> 32:28.287
shot you, and left you for dead.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.680
You don't know
what's in my heart.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.360
What heart?

32:32.840 --> 32:34.808
You don't know
what's in your own heart.

32:36.360 --> 32:40.570
You've given up everything you
are so that you could murder me.

32:40.760 --> 32:44.367
I cross the line
with my eyes wide open.

32:45.880 --> 32:49.123
Well, whose eyes
are you gonna see

32:49.760 --> 32:52.286
when you kill me, Raylan?
Your daddy's?

32:54.040 --> 32:55.405
Not anymore.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.204
Your baby girl's?

32:57.760 --> 33:01.810
Imagine the look on her face
the day she realizes,

33:02.320 --> 33:05.961
"My daddy spent his whole life
trying to walk the line

33:06.760 --> 33:08.000
"and failed."

33:08.080 --> 33:10.082
She'll live her life
the way everybody does.

33:11.600 --> 33:12.931
On her own.

33:14.400 --> 33:16.004
Are you sure you don't
want me to kill you, Raylan,

33:16.080 --> 33:18.003
and keep you a hero?

33:18.360 --> 33:20.761
That makes for a
hell of a bedtime story.

33:22.320 --> 33:24.527
This is the only story
here tonight.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.967
Now, you don't think
that's Bob, do you?

33:30.920 --> 33:32.524
Why would that be Bob?

33:32.600 --> 33:35.365
Well, I shot him a couple of
times down at the trail head.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.408
I think he might still be alive.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.761
You ought to run down there
and see if you can't help him.

33:40.280 --> 33:42.442
Bob can take care of himself.

33:43.680 --> 33:46.604
Hell, Raylan.
Then I have already won.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.167
Stop!

34:31.440 --> 34:34.409
Get down on the ground!
All right! All right!

34:34.480 --> 34:35.760
- Get on the ground.
- All right.

34:39.719 --> 34:41.165
Take this.

34:44.560 --> 34:45.721
Holy shit.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.609
There's a shitload
of money in here.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.007
You take me in, you're
gonna have to hand that over.

34:50.080 --> 34:52.003
You let me go, you can have it.

34:52.639 --> 34:56.167
I do not know what Mr.
Markham has got planned for you,

34:56.280 --> 34:58.203
but I don't want him
to do it to me.

34:58.280 --> 35:00.647
Markham? You're taking me
to see Markham?

35:07.200 --> 35:08.201
Get up.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.325
Get up, you pussy.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.370
What the hell is this?

35:30.360 --> 35:32.044
He tried
to pull one on me.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.366
You just gonna let him
lay there and bleed?

35:35.760 --> 35:38.240
Was I supposed to take him
to the hospital?

35:45.440 --> 35:47.761
Hope he wasn't
someone dear to you.

35:49.400 --> 35:52.006
Just someone I paid
to watch my back.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.242
Money not well spent, I'd say.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.482
Well, slim pickings, way you're
running roughshod over this county.

36:01.760 --> 36:02.921
Trying to flatter me, girl?

36:05.320 --> 36:08.130
Just wondering what you
want from me, is all.

36:08.280 --> 36:12.763
Reason I had Boon come looking for
you is Ava Crowder stole my money.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.681
Stole it from the man
who stole it from me.

36:15.760 --> 36:20.084
That man being your new
business partner, Boyd.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.762
It's the first
I'm hearing of it.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.841
I was thinking, the two
of you being so close,

36:27.920 --> 36:31.288
you might have some idea
where Ava ran off to.

36:31.520 --> 36:33.568
It entered my mind

36:33.640 --> 36:36.450
that maybe you two ladies
conspired together.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.606
Like I said,

36:39.800 --> 36:41.768
first I'm hearing about it.

36:45.560 --> 36:47.050
I believe you.

36:55.240 --> 37:00.406
Couple of deputies I became friends
with called me on my way over.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.807
They picked up Ava Crowder.

37:03.640 --> 37:05.722
Bringing her to me directly.

37:06.080 --> 37:07.923
Suppose you won't be
needing me anymore, then.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.163
If that's the case,
I'll just kill you right now.

37:13.120 --> 37:16.169
But I'm going to give you
30 seconds to change my mind.

37:18.080 --> 37:21.209
Tell me why I shouldn't
kill you, Loretta McCready.

37:22.120 --> 37:23.645
You can kill me,

37:24.840 --> 37:25.887
go right ahead,

37:25.960 --> 37:29.965
buy all this land I've acquired at
auction like you have with others.

37:31.800 --> 37:36.886
But bear in mind the time that may take
and the unexpected costs it may incur.

37:37.680 --> 37:41.082
What I can offer you at this
juncture is a partnership.

37:41.160 --> 37:45.484
Immediate access not only to my land,
but also my growing expertise.

37:46.200 --> 37:48.168
Sure, you got boys
like Boon over here

37:48.240 --> 37:50.641
who know plenty about
watching overland,

37:50.720 --> 37:53.200
but none of them were raised
around these buds like I was.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.446
Add to that my ties
to Harlan County.

37:56.520 --> 37:59.444
Say weed don't get
legalized like we think.

38:01.200 --> 38:02.690
Well, I can tell you
who among those

38:02.800 --> 38:05.883
criminal elements you can trust.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.286
A partnership with me

38:08.120 --> 38:12.728
will tell those same folks
that they can trust you.

38:16.200 --> 38:19.044
First time I saw you,
I liked you.

38:20.600 --> 38:23.001
Didn't much care for what you
did at the Pizza Portal,

38:23.880 --> 38:27.726
but I saw something in you. Remind
me of Katherine a little bit.

38:28.880 --> 38:30.120
More than that,

38:31.040 --> 38:32.929
you remind me of Mags Bennett.

38:34.720 --> 38:37.690
I could use a Harlan girl
in my fold.

38:38.840 --> 38:42.128
Besides, I know Boon here
is sweet on you.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.164
- Bob.
- Raylan.

38:53.240 --> 38:55.402
Oh, Jesus.
Raylan, please help.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.845
Okay.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.605
Jesus Christ, Bob.

39:11.440 --> 39:14.364
Just keep applying pressure, Raylan.
Keep applying...

39:14.440 --> 39:16.841
- I know, Bob.
- To the point of impact.

39:16.920 --> 39:18.490
Stanch the flow of blood.

39:18.560 --> 39:20.369
Hey, just keep that pad
pressed up against your gut.

39:20.440 --> 39:22.329
I am, okay. I just...

39:22.400 --> 39:24.880
Just ask me anything.
Trivia.

39:24.960 --> 39:28.646
Who was Indiana Jones' arch enemy?
Just ask me. Ask me.

39:28.760 --> 39:31.570
Bob, just breathe, buddy.
Just breathe.

39:32.080 --> 39:33.081
Bob?

39:33.960 --> 39:34.961
Bob!

39:36.480 --> 39:37.527
Shit.

39:42.280 --> 39:45.762
I got an officer shot, at least
two in him, gut and shoulder.

39:46.120 --> 39:47.690
Don't eat the... The monkey's
dead. Don't eat the date.

39:47.800 --> 39:50.087
- Hang in there, Bob.
- They call him Belosh.

39:50.480 --> 39:53.723
And link up to the
US Marshals Task Force.

39:53.800 --> 39:56.007
Tell them I know
where Boyd Crowder is.

40:30.040 --> 40:31.166
Son of a bitch!

40:31.400 --> 40:32.686
You goddamn...

40:35.120 --> 40:36.770
Where is she?
She ain't here.

40:36.840 --> 40:38.842
Ava?

40:39.440 --> 40:40.441
Ava?

40:40.560 --> 40:44.167
Boyd Crowder. Bo Crowder.
Bowman Crowder.

40:44.360 --> 40:47.762
Y'all part of the same
big old pile of shit!

40:48.200 --> 40:50.441
Like to beat on the
weak ones, don't you?

40:50.520 --> 40:52.045
You son of a bitch.

40:53.040 --> 40:55.008
I know you think
you're protecting her,

40:56.040 --> 40:57.326
but you ain't.

40:58.280 --> 40:59.770
Now, you want to protect her?

41:01.440 --> 41:04.091
You need to get me to that
money before I get to her.

41:05.080 --> 41:07.686
I'd sooner die than give you
anything you want.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.607
But I do got something
for you you don't want.

41:11.680 --> 41:12.727
Go to hell, Crowder.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.241
Let's go.

41:48.920 --> 41:50.604
Raylan Givens?

41:54.240 --> 41:56.607
I don't suppose you'd
believe me if I said no?
