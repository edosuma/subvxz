Guys, guys.

01:05.010 --> 01:09.070
I'm 30, and I'm a fucking
Lyft driver. Fuck me.

01:09.080 --> 01:12.119
- Fuck me.
- You don't even look 25.

01:12.120 --> 01:14.380
And that mask is gonna make
you look like you're 20.

01:14.420 --> 01:18.480
And you are getting fucking
hotter and smarter

01:18.540 --> 01:21.839
and more awesomer as you get older,

01:21.840 --> 01:23.709
so don't even worry about it, right?

01:23.710 --> 01:25.410
You guys sound like my parents.

01:26.240 --> 01:28.560
That's... a good thing, right?

01:28.600 --> 01:31.220
"Oh, my parents, they're
always like boosting me

01:31.260 --> 01:34.320
and like complimenting
me, it's just so hard... "

01:34.380 --> 01:38.289
- Shut up.
- "Mom and Dad love you... "

01:38.290 --> 01:40.589
- We love you, honey.
- Love you.

01:40.590 --> 01:42.220
I love you guys, too.

01:42.230 --> 01:45.829
You look like a beautiful
marshmallow right now.

01:47.660 --> 01:50.129
What?

01:50.130 --> 01:52.269
You guys.

01:52.270 --> 01:55.269
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait.

01:55.270 --> 01:56.469
We have...

01:56.470 --> 01:58.110
We need to eat some real food.

01:58.200 --> 02:01.009
- On it.
- Because otherwise, uh,

02:01.010 --> 02:02.509
we're gonna green out

02:02.510 --> 02:04.879
and ruin your entire birthday weekend.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.340
This isn't food?

02:06.880 --> 02:08.419
Two veggie lovers

02:08.419 --> 02:10.119
soy cheese gluten-free pizza crust,

02:10.120 --> 02:11.276
here in less then 20 minutes!

02:11.300 --> 02:14.189
- Yeah! Food!
- It's on!

02:19.630 --> 02:21.229
OK, one, two, three.

02:21.230 --> 02:24.360
- Oh, yeah.
- Perfect.

02:24.370 --> 02:25.729
Smiles.

02:25.730 --> 02:27.099
Yeah.

02:27.100 --> 02:28.439
OK, wait. No, hold on.

02:31.770 --> 02:33.309
It's very awkward.

02:33.310 --> 02:35.979
My fat face.

02:35.980 --> 02:37.509
No, hold on.

02:37.510 --> 02:39.049
I look really good there.

02:39.050 --> 02:41.149
OK. That's a good filter.

02:41.150 --> 02:42.940
Don't post that!

02:42.980 --> 02:45.889
- Jesus, dude.
- Fuckin' shit.

02:45.890 --> 02:47.819
What the fuck, man?

02:47.820 --> 02:50.390
Sorry, I, uh, uh, um...

02:50.500 --> 02:54.280
I just, um... We shouldn't be posting

02:54.360 --> 02:58.260
any images on Twitter or Insta-stories

02:58.270 --> 03:01.800
or, um, any Facebook
or anything like that.

03:01.860 --> 03:04.040
Fucking shit. I...

03:05.710 --> 03:08.539
OK.

03:08.540 --> 03:09.910
Why?

03:11.950 --> 03:13.410
Karen.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.819
I thought you said she couldn't come.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.220
You didn't invite her.

03:24.530 --> 03:26.089
Whoa!

03:26.090 --> 03:28.790
You guys. I...

03:28.800 --> 03:32.029
It's my fuckin' 30th, I just...

03:32.030 --> 03:33.569
I couldn't, this weekend.

03:33.570 --> 03:35.560
- Like, I wanted it to be...
- Us.

03:35.580 --> 03:38.169
I just wanted it to be this.

03:38.170 --> 03:41.009
Is that... Am I a terrible person?

03:41.010 --> 03:43.080
No. No. Look.

03:44.280 --> 03:47.179
She's your sister, so, I mean...

03:47.180 --> 03:49.749
I mean, she would be
devastated if she found out.

03:49.750 --> 03:52.720
Yep.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.290
Like...

03:58.660 --> 04:00.000
Fine, I'll say it.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.899
We're all really glad
she's not here. She sucks!

04:02.900 --> 04:05.829
- She's the worst!
- It's so true!

04:05.830 --> 04:07.320
Especially since the divorce,

04:07.330 --> 04:09.969
she's been like double-triple desperate

04:09.970 --> 04:11.500
and weirdo lately.

04:11.510 --> 04:14.009
I know. I... I... I feel awful,

04:14.010 --> 04:16.709
I know I'm smiling, I can
feel my face smiling,

04:16.709 --> 04:20.140
but I feel fucking horrible,
and I, you know, I couldn't.

04:20.149 --> 04:22.910
- Awww.
- Hey, I just wanna say

04:22.920 --> 04:25.280
thank you for preserving this weekend.

04:25.290 --> 04:27.289
You are an amazing friend to us.

04:27.290 --> 04:31.859
Even though you are a
fucking terrible sister.

04:35.700 --> 04:38.199
Pizza! Yeah.

04:40.100 --> 04:42.070
Finally.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.640
Hi, guys!

04:48.070 --> 04:49.610
How's it goin'?

04:52.980 --> 04:55.810
Karen. Uh... you made it.

04:55.820 --> 04:57.560
Um...

04:57.580 --> 04:59.750
Um... come in.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.920
Uh, um...

05:05.930 --> 05:07.959
I just assumed you weren't gonna come,

05:07.960 --> 05:10.930
with everything that's
been going on, uh...

05:12.700 --> 05:15.599
We, uh, we kinda got
started without you,

05:15.600 --> 05:16.999
sorry about that.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.699
Huh.

05:18.700 --> 05:20.900
When you didn't respond to the invite,

05:20.910 --> 05:24.239
I just assumed that you
were too busy to...

05:24.240 --> 05:25.810
You sent me an invite?

05:29.080 --> 05:32.419
Of course I did! I mean,
it's my 30th birthday,

05:32.420 --> 05:34.789
why wouldn't I want my sister there?

05:34.790 --> 05:37.620
I didn't get an invite.

05:38.940 --> 05:41.459
- You didn't?
- Nope.

05:41.460 --> 05:43.890
I just found out about
this a little while ago.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.830
From Mom.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.220
That must have felt terrible

05:52.260 --> 05:57.240
to think that maybe Grace
didn't send you an invite.

05:59.210 --> 06:01.440
But obviously she did,

06:01.460 --> 06:02.649
because, um,

06:02.650 --> 06:04.310
she's your sister.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.770
But it's... you know,

06:05.800 --> 06:07.749
they just...

06:07.750 --> 06:09.889
It's the damn email servers.

06:09.890 --> 06:11.819
- They just...
- Yeah.

06:11.820 --> 06:15.559
They'll send any old email
into Spam these days.

06:15.560 --> 06:19.599
They don't care how important
it is, they just...

06:19.600 --> 06:23.230
straight to your junk... folder.

06:23.380 --> 06:26.020
Um, that's probably what happened.

06:26.040 --> 06:29.969
'Cause mine was in the...
in that folder.

06:29.970 --> 06:32.439
But I found it.

06:32.440 --> 06:35.880
Yeah. Mine too. Was in the junk folder.

06:38.020 --> 06:39.220
Oh.

06:39.280 --> 06:42.749
That, uh, must have been what happened.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.789
Junk folder. Spam.

06:44.790 --> 06:46.659
Fuckin' Spam, man.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.360
You know, Spam.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.599
Right. So...

06:56.600 --> 06:59.599
Well, the good news is, you're here now,

06:59.600 --> 07:01.870
and now we can all celebrate together!

08:14.780 --> 08:18.040
Oh. Do you know what we should do later?

08:18.050 --> 08:21.880
A little group selfie action
to commemorate the occasion.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.980
Yeah.

08:33.530 --> 08:36.558
Wow, you guys are really

08:36.559 --> 08:39.469

08:39.470 --> 08:43.140
- Well, it's a party.
- Yeah, I gue...

08:43.179 --> 08:45.600
I don't know, I've just never really...

08:45.610 --> 08:48.970
felt like I needed that, ya know?

08:49.100 --> 08:51.940
Not that I'm a prude or
anything, it just...

08:52.100 --> 08:55.340
I guess I just don't
have those inhibitions.

08:55.440 --> 08:58.100
Life is just fun enough for me as is.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.619
I don't need the extra lube.

09:00.620 --> 09:02.440
Sure you don't wanna try it?

09:02.500 --> 09:05.920
Yeah. No, I'm fine. But
thank you. You do you.

09:05.930 --> 09:08.560
OK.

09:08.680 --> 09:12.220
How's your love life these days, Matty?

09:12.260 --> 09:16.419
- It's pretty good. Thanks.
- Yeah? Anything steady?

09:16.420 --> 09:18.649
Not really. Not really.

09:18.650 --> 09:21.500
So just hookin' up a bunch...

09:21.560 --> 09:23.820
with a bunch of guys?

09:23.830 --> 09:26.390
Yeah. Hookin' up with a bunch of guys.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.560
'Cause it's what I do.
'Cause I'm gay. Right?

09:29.570 --> 09:32.969
Gay.

09:32.970 --> 09:34.800
When did you figure that out?

09:34.940 --> 09:36.439
Hmm?

09:36.440 --> 09:38.309
That you wanted to be gay.

09:38.310 --> 09:40.370
- Should we go out?
- That I...

09:40.380 --> 09:42.379
- That I wanted to be gay?
- Mm-hmm.

09:42.380 --> 09:43.979
Karen, it's not actually a choice.

09:43.980 --> 09:46.320
Well, have you never
been with a girl before?

09:46.340 --> 09:48.549
Yeah, I mean, in high
school before I came out.

09:48.550 --> 09:51.300
Exactly. So you technically
can be with a girl.

09:51.340 --> 09:54.719
- Oh, my God.
- Shall we go to Miller's? Get $3 PBRs?

09:54.720 --> 09:57.420
I'm just saying that I
think about it. OK?

09:57.430 --> 09:59.549
Ya know, for myself.
Like, when I see boobs,

09:59.550 --> 10:01.820
I know I'm not gay, but...

10:01.880 --> 10:05.020
kinda makes me tingle
a little bit, ya know?

10:05.030 --> 10:07.130
Makes my crotch tickle.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.379
And I'm just wondering if you get that

10:09.380 --> 10:11.339
when you see boobs.

10:11.340 --> 10:13.220
- Or pussies.
- Karen...

10:13.320 --> 10:15.220
I'm curious!

10:17.080 --> 10:18.540
Matty gets it, right?

10:18.580 --> 10:20.310
No, I don't tingle

10:20.320 --> 10:22.659
when I see pussies, 'cause I am gay,

10:22.660 --> 10:24.200
- I'm a gay man...
- Right. But I wonder

10:24.220 --> 10:26.400
if that's because you
prefer to be gay, or...

10:26.420 --> 10:28.579
It's not a fucking preference, Karen,

10:28.580 --> 10:31.519
'cause if it were, everybody
would prefer to be gay!

10:31.520 --> 10:35.140
OK. So if you closed your eyes right now

10:35.460 --> 10:36.859
and I started to jerk you off,

10:36.860 --> 10:38.720
you're telling me that
you wouldn't enjoy it?

10:38.740 --> 10:40.830
If I showed you my tits
you wouldn't wanna

10:40.840 --> 10:43.499
- lick them and suck on 'em?
- Karen, come on!

10:43.500 --> 10:45.220
- Come on, Matty.
- What?!

10:45.280 --> 10:46.420
Gimme that D!

10:46.480 --> 10:48.470
Gimme that D, Matty,
'cause I wanna whack it!

10:48.480 --> 10:51.760
- Oh, my God!
- Got him!

10:51.860 --> 10:53.909
Jesus! Fuck!

10:53.910 --> 10:56.819
Look who got a little bit jealous!

10:56.820 --> 10:59.419
- Tanya!

11:44.930 --> 11:47.729

11:55.360 --> 11:57.299
Fuck this. I'm gonna get some air.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.980
Oh...

12:16.090 --> 12:18.040
I'm gonna go check on her.

12:27.870 --> 12:30.380
Oh, my God. Fuck!

12:30.440 --> 12:32.420
What the fuck was that?

12:32.540 --> 12:34.509
I mean, that was intense.

12:34.510 --> 12:37.449
That was intense, even for her. I...

12:37.450 --> 12:39.630
I'm so fucking sorry.

12:39.640 --> 12:40.640
It's not your fault.

12:40.650 --> 12:44.119
I just feel like my heart is racing

12:44.120 --> 12:46.280
like I'm having a fucking
panic attack or something.

12:50.140 --> 12:52.430
Maybe you should take
it easy on that thing.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.020
Well, I need something.

12:55.030 --> 12:56.039
I don't know how I'm gonna make it

12:56.040 --> 12:57.069
through the weekend with that.

12:57.070 --> 12:58.670
She's not gonna stay all weekend.

13:00.010 --> 13:02.970
Fuck! Ohh, fuck her!

13:02.980 --> 13:04.609
Fuck! You're right.

13:04.610 --> 13:06.440
She'll never leave the fucking party.

13:06.450 --> 13:08.000
She's not gonna fuckin' leave.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.749
I know this is really
hard, but, ya know,

13:10.750 --> 13:12.399
I was talking to one of
my rides the other day,

13:12.400 --> 13:14.919
and hearing it out loud, I...

13:14.920 --> 13:17.040
My parents having her super-young

13:17.050 --> 13:18.620
and then them adopting me

13:18.700 --> 13:21.820
and then them overcompensating,

13:21.880 --> 13:24.460
trying to make me feel at home, I...

13:24.560 --> 13:26.659
it really fucked her up.

13:26.660 --> 13:28.880
Yeah, I get that, that makes sense.

13:28.920 --> 13:32.560
Um... it's just she
tried to grab my dick

13:32.570 --> 13:33.769
and rub her tits in my face,

13:33.770 --> 13:35.840
so, you know, boundaries and stuff.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.309
I get it. I...

13:38.310 --> 13:40.879
I didn't even fuckin' invite her.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.240
But I don't know what to do. I...

13:43.360 --> 13:45.560
Can we just fake it

13:45.700 --> 13:49.250
and make the best of
this birthday weekend?

13:51.450 --> 13:54.360
Yeah.

13:56.490 --> 13:58.700
Oh, God.

14:09.070 --> 14:11.139
Listen.

14:11.140 --> 14:15.620
Tanya just had a... little
talk with me outside,

14:15.630 --> 14:20.080
and she made me realize
how inappropriate I was.

14:21.220 --> 14:23.520
And I see that now. Totally.

14:24.690 --> 14:27.489
So I just...

14:27.490 --> 14:29.560
I would like to apologize.

14:30.630 --> 14:32.360
I'm so sorry.

14:37.730 --> 14:40.870
Uh, it's OK. It's cool.

14:41.970 --> 14:43.700
Thank you, Matty.

14:55.620 --> 14:57.400
Where's Tanya?

14:57.500 --> 14:59.400
Oh, uh, her dad called her,

14:59.420 --> 15:02.060
something about her aunt being sick.

15:03.390 --> 15:06.490
- You OK, Matty?
- Hmm?

15:06.500 --> 15:09.560
Yeah, are you OK? You do look very pale.

15:09.720 --> 15:12.299
I feel like I'm greening
out a little bit,

15:12.300 --> 15:14.720
'cause I'm starting to feel...

15:14.800 --> 15:16.160
a little panicky?

15:16.240 --> 15:18.439
You have had a lot.

15:18.440 --> 15:21.370
Think I'm gonna take a shower.

15:21.380 --> 15:24.510
See if I can sh... shake it off.

15:37.190 --> 15:38.620
Poor guy.

15:38.700 --> 15:41.160
Little too much of the ganja, huh?

15:43.300 --> 15:45.980
Hey... honey...

15:46.070 --> 15:48.620
are you OK?

15:48.700 --> 15:50.600
Yeah, I... I'm fine.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.339
Fine?

15:52.340 --> 15:55.009
It's your birthday.

15:55.010 --> 15:57.479
You should be more than fine.

15:57.480 --> 16:00.879
This should be epic for you.

16:00.880 --> 16:03.460
- I'm gonna go find Tanya.
- She's fine.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.520
Matty?

16:08.300 --> 16:10.720
Just dropped the shampoo.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.860
I'm gonna go check on him.

16:17.870 --> 16:21.230
Gracie, you are spending way
too much of your birthday

16:21.240 --> 16:23.069
worrying about your friends, OK?

16:23.070 --> 16:24.639
That's not the way that this should be.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.020
I want you to sit down here...

16:27.880 --> 16:30.739
and you are gonna find

16:30.740 --> 16:33.979
the cheesiest '80s movie.

16:33.980 --> 16:36.849
OK? And we'll get some snacks

16:36.850 --> 16:39.120
and we'll do each other's
hair like we we used to.

16:39.160 --> 16:41.790
And it's gonna be so fun, I promise.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.499
I'll be right back. I'm just gonna check

16:43.500 --> 16:45.129
on Matty, make sure he's OK.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.689
- Maybe I should.
- No, no,

16:46.690 --> 16:48.529
I got it. I'm an EMT.

16:48.530 --> 16:50.630
This is what I do. I got you.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.770
Oh, God.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.400
Huh? What the fuck!

17:28.780 --> 17:32.280
_

17:56.460 --> 17:58.100
Poor guy passed out.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.380
- Is he OK?
- Yeah, yeah. He's fine.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.170
No worries.

18:55.290 --> 18:56.399
Hey, it's Tanya,

18:56.400 --> 18:57.589
I'm doing something better right now,

18:57.590 --> 18:59.620
so you know what to do.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.189
Hey, uh, where are you?

19:01.190 --> 19:04.560
Can you just give me a call
whenever you get this, please?

19:06.360 --> 19:09.820
Well, I guess it's just
the two of us now.

19:11.600 --> 19:14.440
Just like it used to be.

19:14.500 --> 19:17.109
I'm worried about Tanya.

19:17.110 --> 19:18.460
She's on the phone.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.579
I just called her, and went outside,

19:20.580 --> 19:22.640
and she's not anywhere.

19:22.650 --> 19:26.679
Hmm. Well, maybe it really
was a family emergency.

19:26.680 --> 19:29.820
- Her car is outside.
- Gracie...

19:29.880 --> 19:32.600
you're so stressed out on your birthday,

19:32.620 --> 19:34.260
and we should just be celebrating.

19:34.300 --> 19:37.760
But Karen, I'm worried about my friend.

19:37.780 --> 19:39.559
Well, I'm here, I mean,
we can have a party

19:39.560 --> 19:41.019
just the two of us.

19:41.020 --> 19:42.960
You're not understanding
what I'm saying.

19:42.970 --> 19:45.499
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

19:45.500 --> 19:46.930
My friend is missing,

19:46.940 --> 19:49.170
my other friend is passed
out on the bathroom floor

19:49.180 --> 19:50.939
because he was so stressed
out he smoked himself

19:50.940 --> 19:53.340
into a fucking weed coma.

19:54.980 --> 19:57.400
I see.

19:57.510 --> 19:59.950
I think I understand.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.800
Grace, I have a question for you.

20:05.520 --> 20:08.050
Did you really...

20:08.060 --> 20:11.720
invite me to your birthday party?

20:11.920 --> 20:13.159
You know, honestly,

20:13.160 --> 20:15.040
at this point, what does it even matter?

20:15.050 --> 20:16.929
It matters a lot.

20:16.930 --> 20:18.529
To me.

20:18.530 --> 20:21.130
What do you want to hear, Karen?

20:21.140 --> 20:23.100
- Just the truth.
- I don't think you do.

20:23.110 --> 20:24.500
I think you want to hear that

20:24.510 --> 20:26.540
you were the only person
I invited to my birthday

20:26.550 --> 20:28.160
because you're my only friend.

20:28.170 --> 20:30.239
Just like when I was a kid
and I used to cling to you,

20:30.240 --> 20:32.960
and that everything's
just fucking perfect

20:33.000 --> 20:34.810
like when I first joined the family.

20:34.820 --> 20:37.120
You know what else you want to hear?

20:37.160 --> 20:40.439
That I don't notice that you ostracize

20:40.440 --> 20:41.800
and push away my friends

20:41.880 --> 20:46.289
by you acting like a total
fucking weirdo freak,

20:46.290 --> 20:49.360
all so you can have me to yourself.

20:51.730 --> 20:53.330
Wow.

20:56.340 --> 21:00.440
I cannot believe that you would
say those things about me.

21:02.610 --> 21:05.340
I mean, what do you think
is going on here tonight?

21:07.210 --> 21:10.380
Do you really think I'm trying
to get rid of your friends?

21:12.550 --> 21:15.650
What, that I... followed Tanya out

21:15.660 --> 21:17.279
and killed her by the vending machine

21:17.280 --> 21:19.990
and hid her body behind a dumpster?

21:21.040 --> 21:23.029
And what about Matty?

21:23.030 --> 21:25.429
That I lied about going in to help him,

21:25.430 --> 21:27.219
and instead strangled him

21:27.220 --> 21:30.850
and laid him on the bathroom
floor like he was sleeping

21:30.880 --> 21:32.870
so you wouldn't be suspicious?

21:35.180 --> 21:38.440
Is that what you think is
going on here tonight?

21:39.280 --> 21:41.680
I didn't say that.

21:44.420 --> 21:46.649
Good.

21:46.650 --> 21:49.250
Because that's not what's happening.

21:53.530 --> 21:54.640
- Matty!
- He's sleeping.

21:54.740 --> 21:56.420
- Matty!
- He's sleeping, Grace!

21:56.440 --> 21:59.160
Come on! Why are you
acting so difficult?

21:59.170 --> 22:00.870
This is your birthday.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.169
Where are you going?

22:05.170 --> 22:06.500
I'm going for a walk.

22:06.580 --> 22:07.880
Well, then, I'll go with you.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.440
That's OK. OK?

22:09.540 --> 22:10.540
I want to come with you.

22:10.550 --> 22:12.309
But I don't want you to.

22:12.310 --> 22:14.120
You don't mean that. You're
just upset right now.

22:14.130 --> 22:16.519
No, I fucking mean it.

22:16.520 --> 22:20.420
Get the fuck out of my fucking life!

22:21.690 --> 22:22.960
I'm done!

23:48.940 --> 23:50.540
Grace!

23:50.640 --> 23:53.409
Come back here!

23:53.410 --> 23:55.240
Leave me alone!

24:56.360 --> 25:00.640
