00:14.647 --> 00:16.012
Put it back!

01:01.127 --> 01:03.254
- Sweetness.
- Shake, what you got there?

01:03.329 --> 01:05.297
- No, do not get near this.
- What is it?

01:05.364 --> 01:06.696
Just the fruits of victory.

01:06.766 --> 01:09.564
I wouldn't expect you to understand,
being a loser.

01:09.636 --> 01:13.197
- The Shake 'em Up Finals?
- Yeah, I won "Participant".

01:13.273 --> 01:16.299
Don't tell me you used the Danger Cart
in some demolition derby.

01:16.376 --> 01:18.606
Hell, no! I got my own wheels.

01:19.646 --> 01:21.910
Open up, or I'm opening it for you.

01:21.981 --> 01:24.381
- You know the drill.
- Drill? No, I don't.

01:25.118 --> 01:27.848
- Carl, how you doing, man?
- Take a look at that.

01:28.588 --> 01:31.819
This is pretty boss, man.
Where'd you get those graphics done?

01:31.891 --> 01:35.258
- Thank you. I didn't frigging do it.
- Then why're you showing it to me?

01:35.328 --> 01:38.263
Someone stole it, raced it,
and brought it back!

01:38.631 --> 01:43.125
- Well, you did call the police, right?
- Yeah, good one. I never thought of that.

01:43.203 --> 01:46.297
No, they stopped taking my calls long ago.

01:46.372 --> 01:49.603
Well, we're kind of
not detectives anymore.

01:49.676 --> 01:51.644
That wasn't making us
a whole lot of money.

01:51.711 --> 01:55.203
No, sir. But now we got us
a mail order telemarket business:

01:55.281 --> 01:56.543
Ultra Megabraid.

01:56.616 --> 01:59.016
- Carl, I see you noticing my braids.
- No, I'm not.

01:59.085 --> 02:02.384
Did you know you can have braids
just like this? With Ultra Megabraid.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.116
- You want to try one?
- No.

02:04.190 --> 02:06.818
- We could do your shoulders.
- They come in seven colors...

02:06.893 --> 02:09.383
and you can add decorative beads
and glitter.

02:09.461 --> 02:12.192
- Make your own unique Ultra Megabraid.
- $3.99.

02:12.265 --> 02:13.960
Kiss my ultra mega-ass.

02:14.033 --> 02:16.501
And if you order now,
we'll include an egg slicer.

02:16.569 --> 02:18.059
Meatwad, he's gone.

02:18.605 --> 02:20.732
I ain't never gonna sell one of these.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.866
No, that's not the right attitude.

02:22.942 --> 02:25.706
But you're probably right.
You won't sell any of this crap.

02:25.778 --> 02:29.043
Are you depressed?
Has high interest rates got you down?

02:29.115 --> 02:30.275
My name is Meatwad...

02:30.350 --> 02:33.945
and today I'm here to offer you
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

02:34.020 --> 02:38.252
Sell your organs, live, over the Internet.
Get money back on your baby.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.258
That don't sound right. Where's my sheet?

02:40.527 --> 02:42.154
All right, take her up.

02:42.462 --> 02:45.226
Be careful with...
Well, who frigging cares?

02:45.298 --> 02:49.530
Wait, Carl! No, wait!
I mean, what are you doing there, buddy?

02:49.602 --> 02:52.935
I can't sell it like this.
I gotta give it to the kidney foundation.

02:53.006 --> 02:56.874
Maybe get a little tax write-off or...
What are you doing with that helmet?

02:56.943 --> 02:59.207
This? This is for the rapture.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.771
- Armageddon?
- Well, it looks like a racing helmet.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.908
Yeah, it does. But it's not.

03:04.984 --> 03:06.975
Well, I stand corrected.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.882
All right! My wheels got here!

03:09.956 --> 03:12.925
Wait a minute! What is this?
What are you doing here?

03:12.992 --> 03:17.429
Yep, Carl, the old kidney foundation really
came through for me with my freebie.

03:17.497 --> 03:20.864
I been on that damn list for a while.
But they said, you know...

03:20.934 --> 03:23.232
since I was, you know...

03:25.004 --> 03:26.699
- Unsanitary?
- Yeah.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.237
Yeah, that and inoperate... Racism.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.471
- Infection.
- Waiting to happen.

03:32.545 --> 03:35.241
And they didn't nowise
want to waste no kidneys on me.

03:35.315 --> 03:37.180
And I said, "Well, all right".

03:37.250 --> 03:41.584
So they're saying they give me this car,
and I can get sick all I want in here.

03:41.654 --> 03:43.451
You don't really need kidneys.

03:43.523 --> 03:47.653
Look, I know it's shallow,
but I wants them. It's a status thing.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.059
That's what separates the men
from the animals.

03:50.129 --> 03:52.359
Actually, Meatwad,
animals have kidneys, too.

03:52.432 --> 03:55.731
Well, animals ain't got no job
working for the city.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.336
- Neither do you.
- Yeah, well...

03:59.305 --> 04:01.330
Damn, you burned me. I got nothing.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.807
So back off my car and hold your roll.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.708
Ease off the pedal there, Jeff Gordon.

04:07.313 --> 04:08.974
I am keeping the graphics.

04:09.048 --> 04:12.381
That's fine, they ain't too wicked no more.
It's the Hotwad.

04:12.452 --> 04:15.080
We gonna fix this up
and make this my work car.

04:15.154 --> 04:17.019
Frylock, I'm looking at you.

04:17.089 --> 04:20.753
- This is gonna be a lot of work and money.
- I know, I got tools.

04:24.631 --> 04:28.658
Okay, that should do it.
Okay, now when I say, "Crank it... "

04:28.735 --> 04:32.899
you do whatever it is people do
when they're told to do that.

04:33.539 --> 04:36.804
<i>I ain't hearing that, see?
You asking or you telling?</i>

04:36.876 --> 04:39.436
<i>'Cause nobody tells Boxy Brown.</i>

04:39.512 --> 04:42.879
Boxy, this isn't a big deal.
I mean, I'm just asking a favor.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.918
If you remember, I helped you
move your grandma to the home...

04:45.985 --> 04:47.282
and that was my day off.

04:47.353 --> 04:50.322
<i>That wasn't no grandma, boy.
That was a grocery bag.</i>

04:50.390 --> 04:52.858
<i>- But you just a box.
- I just a what, bitch?</i>

04:52.925 --> 04:55.951
You're Duke of New York.
You're A-Number 1.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.257
<i>Say it louder, boy.</i>

04:57.330 --> 04:59.958
You're Duke of New York. A-Number 1.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.797
- How's he doing out there?
- He hasn't done jack.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.838
He's been sawing on that thing
for two hours.

05:05.905 --> 05:07.600
Are you sure he should be using a saw?

05:07.674 --> 05:10.199
- Well, not a plastic one.
- I knew that looked wrong.

05:10.276 --> 05:11.743
You need this drill!

05:11.944 --> 05:14.412
Get out of there.
What, are you trying to break it?

05:14.480 --> 05:16.414
It's not metric? Give it to me.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.712
You gotta whomp it on the side like this.

05:18.785 --> 05:21.652
- You better start, you mother...
- Stop, stupid!

05:21.721 --> 05:24.849
All right, that's it. Let me take a look.
Shake, get a flashlight.

05:24.924 --> 05:26.221
Meatwad, get behind the wheel.

05:26.292 --> 05:28.988
Tell your buddy Dewey
to get out of the fan housing.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.462
Boy, you are gonna lose an arm that way!

05:31.798 --> 05:34.528
- Okay, now crank it.
- Okay, here we go.

05:36.469 --> 05:38.130
- You ready?
- Yeah.

05:38.871 --> 05:40.270
- You ready now?
- Ready.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.137
- Here it comes.
- Okay.

05:44.610 --> 05:46.703
- Come on, I'm ready.
- You ready for it?

05:46.779 --> 05:49.748
- I'm ready, already! Just do it!
- Okay, don't yell at me.

05:49.816 --> 05:52.182
How's that sound? Do you like that song?

05:52.585 --> 05:55.850
- I meant turn the key.
- I did. This is Key.

05:55.922 --> 05:59.085
K104, Jersey's Kicking Country.

05:59.158 --> 06:01.149
The key to the ignition, Meatwad!

06:01.227 --> 06:03.354
- I'm turning it!
- That's the steering wheel!

06:03.429 --> 06:04.896
I'm going left.

06:05.331 --> 06:07.322
But you're turning to the right.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.528
- Shake, where's the light?
- Yeah, where's the light?

06:10.603 --> 06:12.901
- No, a demon!
- There it is.

06:12.972 --> 06:15.440
It was last seen in the woods.

06:15.508 --> 06:17.703
- Great.
- By a man with a hook!

06:18.678 --> 06:21.146
All right, that's it. I'm through. Forget it.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.240
The radiator's split, the tranny's shot,
the wheels are melted...

06:24.317 --> 06:27.480
the crankshaft somehow found its way
into the woofer in the back...

06:27.553 --> 06:29.453
and all the fluids are in the floorboard.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.217
No, man, that's a soft drink machine.

06:31.290 --> 06:34.088
- They're fluids, Meatwad!
- Soft drinks are fluid.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.027
Look, I know it's not an ideal situation...

06:37.196 --> 06:40.359
but let's just take a few breaths
and calm down.

06:40.867 --> 06:43.028
Let's just get in there, and you do it.

06:43.102 --> 06:45.627
Do you have any idea
how much money this is gonna cost?

06:45.705 --> 06:49.971
I can't get a lot of money
if I can't get to work driving my rocket car.

06:50.042 --> 06:51.873
It's Meatwad's car. It's up to him.

06:51.944 --> 06:53.969
- Tell him you want it fixed.
- I want it fixed.

06:54.046 --> 06:57.140
See? And I'll help you. Really, I can do this.

06:57.483 --> 07:00.418
All right. Where did the light go?
Shine it over here.

07:00.486 --> 07:04.320
I set it down right over there
beside the demon of the flashlight.

07:04.390 --> 07:05.914
The demon! No!

07:05.992 --> 07:09.257
All right, that's it... all of you.
Y'all fix it yourselves.

07:09.462 --> 07:13.193
See what you did?
Now I'm not gonna get a ride to my job.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.734
Thanks for taking food
out of my kids' mouths.

07:15.802 --> 07:18.396
Get out of here, boy. I gotta get to my job.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.305
Yeah, you! Yeah, I'm looking at you!

07:26.479 --> 07:29.107
Move your van,
or I'm gonna move it for you!

07:29.282 --> 07:33.116
Go to Mach 1. Engage warp speed.
I'm late for work.

07:36.055 --> 07:39.081
I'm a little worried about Meatwad.
I think he's losing his mind.

07:39.158 --> 07:41.888
Watch this. I think he's losing his license.

07:44.430 --> 07:46.796
Oh, shoot. The Bronx 5-0.

07:48.167 --> 07:50.965
Is there an emergency or something?

07:51.037 --> 07:53.528
- Well, yeah, I mean...
- Somebody having a baby?

07:53.606 --> 07:57.098
- You know, I need to get to work and...
- What's going on here?

07:57.610 --> 07:59.874
I'm a wild man. I can't drive 55 mph.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.379
No wheels here, either.

08:01.447 --> 08:04.712
- And you passed an inspection like that?
- Yes, sir.

08:04.951 --> 08:08.216
I saw you ran through a couple of lights,
and I'm thinking:

08:08.287 --> 08:11.848
"Surely this little lady wouldn't do that
in her own town".

08:12.225 --> 08:13.419
Where are you from?

08:13.493 --> 08:16.121
Now, they was yellow
when I went through them.

08:16.395 --> 08:17.555
They were red.

08:17.630 --> 08:20.155
Like your ass is gonna be
when I get through with you.

08:20.233 --> 08:23.930
Step out of the car, please.
Did you drink anything tonight, ma'am?

08:24.003 --> 08:25.937
Hell, yeah! Can I mix you something?

08:26.005 --> 08:28.667
I want you to walk in a straight line
to that manhole.

08:28.741 --> 08:31.232
When you fall in,
I wanna hear the alphabet backwards.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.403
- Okay.
- Sucker!

08:36.816 --> 08:38.613
Did you see that? He stole my car.

08:38.683 --> 08:41.015
- Yeah. Did you get the plate number?
- Good idea.

08:41.087 --> 08:43.078
It's not Sunday, lady! Let's go!

08:44.256 --> 08:48.193
What's that letter that does this?
With the thing? There's two of them.

08:48.261 --> 08:51.856
I was out of control. But
I'm such a good driver, I brought it back.

08:51.931 --> 08:54.092
Frylock, you've gotta get that car fixed.

08:54.166 --> 08:57.499
Well, I tried to help you,
but you two just kept on goofing off.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.197
We're pretty funny when we do that.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.968
Go see a real mechanic.
See if he thinks it's funny.

09:02.174 --> 09:03.368
Here's the estimate.

09:03.442 --> 09:07.538
He told me I may not like what I see,
but it's the truth. Check it out.

09:07.747 --> 09:10.181
$32,000? That doesn't sound right.

09:10.249 --> 09:12.774
- Did he even look at the car?
- Over the phone, yeah.

09:12.852 --> 09:16.413
He says that it sounded like
my hobbit that turns the crankcase...

09:16.489 --> 09:18.252
is depressed and needs therapy.

09:18.324 --> 09:22.317
We need to get us a new hobbit.
They's from the land beyond time.

09:22.395 --> 09:26.388
Land beyond time's also gonna hook us up
with the unicorn for the radiator.

09:26.465 --> 09:29.229
I won't even tell you about
that haunted air conditioner.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.862
Plus, the air filter,
that's made of plutonium.

09:31.938 --> 09:36.375
That's gonna involve Superman,
so plus shipping from Krypton.

09:36.776 --> 09:39.370
Then the cow jumped over the moon.

09:39.445 --> 09:41.879
Is this what he told you,
or is this how you heard it?

09:41.948 --> 09:45.213
You should read it for yourself.
I don't even know anymore.

09:45.318 --> 09:48.378
Wow, he actually did write all that.
What an ass...

09:48.454 --> 09:51.116
Don't say that.
Carl said he's a guy you can trust.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.249
- He'd do me right.
- Yeah, I bet he would.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.851
- Gentlemen, I have the answer.
- What the hell...

09:55.928 --> 09:58.294
Yeah, "what the hell". Say it!

09:58.364 --> 10:01.356
Say "what the hell" again.
I'll be dumbfounded.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.095
- That'll never work.
- I know.

10:03.169 --> 10:06.696
The colors are not quite right.
I specifically asked for Mandarin Copper.

10:06.772 --> 10:09.673
I get stuck with Sangria Sunrise.

10:09.742 --> 10:13.234
- Makes it look like some tarted-up hussy.
- I ain't gonna be part of this.

10:13.312 --> 10:15.280
Go ahead and kill yourselves,
if you want to.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.441
Yeah, have fun with your dollies.

10:19.518 --> 10:21.782
Meatwad, hit the switch.

10:23.856 --> 10:27.155
Okay, turn it off for a second.
Let's just turn it off.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.117
What was that noise?

10:29.795 --> 10:31.660
Where is my white hatchback?

10:31.731 --> 10:34.222
- Excuse me?
- And why are there skidmarks there?

10:34.300 --> 10:37.360
I just got through mowing the lawn,
if that's a crime.

10:37.436 --> 10:39.597
I frigging rented this thing this morning!

10:39.672 --> 10:42.334
Yeah, we know how you did it.
Congratulations.

10:42.408 --> 10:46.777
The bank gave you a credit card.
It doesn't make you better than me.

10:46.912 --> 10:50.746
But, you see, nobody gives me credit,
because I'm a bad risk...

10:50.816 --> 10:52.807
and I don't pay my bills on time.

10:52.885 --> 10:55.319
So I have to work for what I have.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.013
Did my car always have that, or am I just...

10:58.090 --> 11:01.491
What? Class? Style? I don't think so.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.551
