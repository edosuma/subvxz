WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:03.204
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Okay, let's do this, peeps.

00:03.237 --> 00:04.338
After breakups and make-ups,
 Jane the Virgin

00:04.372 --> 00:06.374
finally got engaged to Michael.

00:06.407 --> 00:08.742
Will you marry me? Marry me!
Yes! Yes!

00:08.776 --> 00:12.546
And her baby daddy Rafael,
 well, he said he'd try

00:12.580 --> 00:15.549
to accept it, maybe because he
 had other things on his mind.

00:15.583 --> 00:18.452
See, his ex-wife Petra
 just gave birth to twins.

00:18.486 --> 00:21.089
Elsa and Anna.
Like in Frozen?

00:21.122 --> 00:22.490
No one except for you
would think of that.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.557
Oh, and he recently learned

00:23.591 --> 00:25.059
his mother was a crime lord.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.827
I know, cray-cray, right?

00:26.860 --> 00:28.496
Even crazier,
 he was working with Michael

00:28.529 --> 00:30.631
to find his long-lost brother.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.165
Derek Ruvelle, son of Rafael's

00:32.200 --> 00:33.634
mother Elena Di Nola.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.103
Our buddy Derek
disappeared the day after

00:35.136 --> 00:36.837
Mutter's identity
was discovered.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.839
I know, straight out
 of a telenovela, right?

00:38.872 --> 00:41.442
Well, imagine this--
 Jane's father,

00:41.475 --> 00:44.312
international telenovela star
 Rogelio de la Vega

00:44.345 --> 00:46.114
was kidnapped
 by his biggest fan.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.849
And even worse, he's in a fight
 with his family.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.185
I just think I need
some space right now.

00:51.219 --> 00:52.586
So they aren't even
 that worried!

00:52.620 --> 00:54.388
Such bad luck, right?

00:54.422 --> 00:56.324
And speaking of, Alba

00:56.357 --> 00:57.758
had been corresponding
 with her first lover,

00:57.791 --> 01:00.794
the notorious
 Pablo Alonso Segura.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.730
And Xo invited him for a visit.

01:06.667 --> 01:10.138
And I got to say I really hope
 that's not true, don't you?

01:12.340 --> 01:14.308
Breaking news--

01:14.342 --> 01:17.678
our Jane Gloriana Villanueva
 always had strong opinions.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.613
I'm embarrassed
to be from Florida.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.182
About politics.

01:22.483 --> 01:24.485
Too revealing-- change!

01:24.518 --> 01:26.220
Her mother's wardrobe.

01:26.254 --> 01:28.222
Jane, no!

01:31.192 --> 01:33.361
And her grandmother's
 superstitions.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.429
Stop, that's ridiculous.
 Ay!

01:38.766 --> 01:41.135
And I don't want to mistake
 correlation for causation,

01:41.169 --> 01:44.838
but here we are today.

01:44.872 --> 01:49.177
Six weeks away from our Jane
 marrying the man of her dreams.

01:52.313 --> 01:55.149
I'm working on it.
I'm working on it.

01:55.183 --> 01:56.517
I know what you're thinking.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.186
That we've been here
 before, right?

01:58.219 --> 02:00.188
But this time was different.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.789
This time there were
 no reservations.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.824
Did you make the reservations
for the chair rentals?

02:03.857 --> 02:05.493
No, I'm finalizing
the head count.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.561
Michael's brother's a no,
so that's 25.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.763
No, 26-- both his parents
are driving down.

02:09.797 --> 02:13.301
Seriously? Aren't they, like,
archenemies or something?

02:13.334 --> 02:15.769
Well, they're not in a comic
book, but yes, basically.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.305
They haven't been
in the same room

02:17.338 --> 02:18.672
since Michael's
high school graduation.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.808
He's freaking out.
Well, you never know.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.943
I mean, engagements
bring people together.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.713
Michael's parents,
Alba and Pablo.

02:28.616 --> 02:32.253
Ah, yes, Pablo Alonso Segura.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.554
The man,

02:33.587 --> 02:35.556
the myth, the legend.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.258
Abuela, you're gonna have to,

02:37.291 --> 02:40.694
because he's traveling
from Venezuela.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.299
You're being ridiculous.
Now, back to the list.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.835
The only question mark
is... Dad.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.337
He still hasn't
gotten back to you?

02:49.370 --> 02:50.404
No.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.573
I'm calling him again.

02:52.606 --> 02:53.674
(phone autodials)

02:53.707 --> 02:54.942
LOLA:
Hello?

02:54.975 --> 02:56.444
Hey, Paola.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.546
Just trying to get in touch
with my dad.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.348
I'm sorry, Jane.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.949
He just stepped into a meeting

03:01.982 --> 03:04.685
with a very important
casting director.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.421
He'll be tied up for a while.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.723
(sighs)
Have him call me back.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.359
Tell him that it's important.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.561
You know what?
Tell him

03:13.594 --> 03:14.928
I'm marrying Michael.

03:14.962 --> 03:18.299
You got it. I'll
give him that message.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.567
(beep)

03:19.600 --> 03:21.569
If you don't call...

03:21.602 --> 03:23.704
she'll know something's wrong.

03:23.737 --> 03:24.805
No!

03:24.838 --> 03:25.973
You can't call!

03:26.006 --> 03:27.641
Stop arguing with me!

03:27.675 --> 03:29.977
You'll say good-bye
to them tonight...

03:31.545 --> 03:34.348
...when we livestream
our murder-suicide.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.385
Okay, if he doesn't respond,

03:37.418 --> 03:38.552
then there's something
definitely wrong.

03:38.586 --> 03:39.653
Something is definitely wrong.

03:39.687 --> 03:40.754
God, this is frustrating!

03:40.788 --> 03:43.591
Thank you for taking Mateo.

03:43.624 --> 03:47.261
I should go-- I don't want
to be late for my new advisor.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.862
Stop. She's gonna love you.

03:48.896 --> 03:52.433
I got to be frank-- last thing
I wanted is another advisee.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.443
I hear you.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.378
A-And I'm sorry
to be adding to your schedule.

04:04.412 --> 04:05.879
Yeah, and apparently,

04:05.913 --> 04:08.782
you wanted a new advisor
because of some complications

04:08.816 --> 04:10.518
with your old one?

04:10.551 --> 04:11.785
That's one way to put it.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.024
Well, life is complicated.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.593
B-But it's all material, right?

04:19.627 --> 04:20.761
That's the clichÃ©.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.496
So, what do you write?

04:22.530 --> 04:25.333
Well, uh, my genre is romance.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.467
(quietly):
Barf.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.768
Did she just say...

04:27.801 --> 04:29.803
Ex-Excuse me, what was that?

04:29.837 --> 04:33.073
I said "barf."

04:33.106 --> 04:35.275
*

04:43.851 --> 04:46.520
So, you're not a fan of romance.
Good to know. (chuckles)

04:46.554 --> 04:48.556
But I do hope
you keep an open mind.

04:48.589 --> 04:51.559
My mind is always open.
Well, I was...

04:51.592 --> 04:52.826
Careful, Jane,
 you're running out

04:52.860 --> 04:54.462
of English Department
 faculty members.

04:54.495 --> 04:55.996
Just as long as it passes
the Bechdel test, okay?

04:56.029 --> 04:57.398
Got it. Yes.
You've heard of it?

04:57.431 --> 04:58.399
No. No, I haven't.

04:58.432 --> 04:59.867
It's a three-part question.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.736
Does the work feature
two female characters...

05:02.770 --> 05:04.738
with names...

05:04.772 --> 05:07.941
who talk about something
other than a man?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.677
Like, for instance,
you, Jane,

05:09.710 --> 05:11.512
talking to me,
Professor Donaldson,

05:11.545 --> 05:13.681
about the work--
that passes the test.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.751
But you, Jane,
talking to me, Marlene,

05:17.785 --> 05:20.388
about your former advisor,
Jonathan Chavez--

05:20.421 --> 05:22.523
that doesn't pass the test.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.526
Oh, yeah, well...

05:25.559 --> 05:27.528
I mean, m-my work
certainly passes the test.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.563
Translation:
 Jane will certainly check

05:29.597 --> 05:31.632
to make sure her work
 passes the test.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.101
(laughs):
Great! Because otherwise...

05:34.134 --> 05:35.803
barf.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.841
Just a little spit-up.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.376
You're okay, Anna.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.977
(Elsa crying)

05:44.011 --> 05:46.947
Hey, Petra,
can you...?
Sure.

05:46.980 --> 05:50.083
(electronic ding)
No, no, no, I meant
can you just pick her up?

05:50.117 --> 05:51.952
Oh, no, it's fine.
I needed water.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.388
Hi. Elsa's
crying again.

05:54.422 --> 05:56.657
And, um, I needed water,
room temperature.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.427
Again, that's not
what the button is for.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.729
But anyway,
I have some good news.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.465
Dr. Grove says you're
getting out today.

06:04.498 --> 06:04.932
What?

06:05.966 --> 06:07.034
I-I thought I, um,

06:07.067 --> 06:08.068
I needed to stay longer

06:08.101 --> 06:09.537
because of my platelet problem.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.605
Things look better.
You're good to go.

06:11.639 --> 06:12.940
The babies, too?

06:12.973 --> 06:15.075
Yes. The babies, too.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.545
Petra...

06:17.578 --> 06:19.079
don't worry, we can do this.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.048
JANE:
 It's gonna be okay.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.716
Michael, I promise.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.018
(sighs): Oh, I don't know.
The last time my parents

06:25.052 --> 06:26.620
were together,
it was a disaster.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.889
There was fighting,
finger-pointing, tears--

06:28.922 --> 06:30.591
mostly mine, but still...
(laughs)

06:30.624 --> 06:32.926
Come on, they are not gonna
do that in front of me.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.162
That's because
the only thing
they can agree on

06:35.195 --> 06:37.698
is how much they love you.

06:37.731 --> 06:38.966
Which is why you
can't leave the room.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.568
I won't leave.
No, I'm serious.

06:40.601 --> 06:41.735
Not even to go
to the bathroom.

06:41.769 --> 06:42.736
Well, I might have
to go to the bathroom.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.438
Remember that astronaut
that put the diaper on?

06:44.472 --> 06:46.206
Stop it. (laughs)
Where's your commitment?

06:46.239 --> 06:49.543
No, I'm serious.
Oh.
(doorbell rings)

06:49.577 --> 06:51.512
Hi, Mom.

06:51.545 --> 06:52.946
Hi, Dad.
Hey.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.748
Hi!

06:54.782 --> 06:55.816
Oh, Jane. Hi.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.552
I didn't realize
you'd be here.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.220
Oh. W-Well, I wanted to see you.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.622
Come on in.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.692
Mike, we were
hoping for a...

07:04.725 --> 07:06.660
private moment alone.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.464
We have some
important family business

07:10.498 --> 07:11.865
we want
to discuss.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.834
Oh. Well, it's just Jane.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.136
I'm just gonna tell her
whatever you say anyway.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.705
MRS. CORDERO:
Fine.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.139
We think you're
making a mistake.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.741
Don't marry her.

07:20.774 --> 07:21.642
Barf.

07:27.715 --> 07:30.584
You... you don't want
Michael to marry me?

07:30.618 --> 07:32.720
You were heartbroken, Mikey.
Don't you remember?

07:32.753 --> 07:34.888
When we found out the two
of you were back together,

07:34.922 --> 07:37.157
I called your father.
We got to talking.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.126
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 At least Jane's
 still bringing them together.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.261
We wanted to reach out, but
then the next thing we knew,

07:41.294 --> 07:43.731
we were getting an evite
to an engagement party.

07:43.764 --> 07:46.099
That's enough.
That's enough.
Michael... it's okay.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.901
You guys should talk.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.170
Um... I'll see you later.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.173
(clears throat
softly)

07:53.206 --> 07:55.175
I am so sorry.
You should not be leaving.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.144
They should be leaving.
I'll kick them out.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.880
No, no, no, don't do that.
Go back inside-- you know,

07:59.913 --> 08:01.582
the longer you're out here,
the worse it'll be,

08:01.615 --> 08:03.083
because then they'll
think I'm upset.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.217
You are upset.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.219
No, no, I'm not.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.856
Just go back inside
and talk to them.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.524
Oh, yeah, and remind your mom

08:10.558 --> 08:11.859
about the time
we got mani-pedis,

08:11.892 --> 08:13.627
and a smoothie,
and we split an Orange Zinger,

08:13.661 --> 08:15.763
and she said that I felt like
the daughter that she never had,

08:15.796 --> 08:17.798
and make it seem like
I told you that at the time

08:17.831 --> 08:19.232
because I was so touched,
and not today, okay?

08:19.266 --> 08:20.601
Okay, go. Go.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.102
PETRA:
 Honestly, go.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.605
We'll be fine.
I was planning
on staying over.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.273
I've got it covered.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.275
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Well, Helga has it covered.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.843
And Wilma.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.279
Well, I guess
you could sit in here

08:32.312 --> 08:34.081
with Helga and Wilma
all night.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.684
(laughs)

08:37.717 --> 08:40.520
See? They think
it's silly, too.

08:47.961 --> 08:50.598
Heard you've
been looking for me.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.234
The cops send you?

08:54.267 --> 08:55.936
No.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.606
But they do want
to talk to you.

08:58.639 --> 09:01.074
I went to prep school
with a topflight attorney.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.176
I'll let him know.
Good.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.814
Okay, look, man, this isn't
about the cops, okay?

09:06.847 --> 09:08.616
Up until a few months ago,

09:08.649 --> 09:10.618
I didn't even know
I had a brother.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.152
Did-did you know?

09:12.185 --> 09:15.022
About me?
No.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.190
Okay.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.093
I mean, so, can... can
we at least just talk?

09:20.127 --> 09:21.629
Maybe.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.330
I'll be in touch.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.332
I'm staying here, by the way.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.701
Mind if I send you the bill...

09:27.735 --> 09:29.302
brother?

09:29.336 --> 09:32.105
(door closes)

09:32.139 --> 09:33.340
You'll meet him in public.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.108
Don't go off with him alone.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.644
Okay, I got it.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.679
(beeps twice)

09:38.712 --> 09:39.847
Oh.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.849
I... I should go.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.818
It's, uh... Jane.

09:44.852 --> 09:46.253
Yeah. Never not awkward.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.955
Maybe once Mateo's in college.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.256
Let me know when you see him.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.258
(smacks lips)
Okay.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.360
(beep)

09:53.393 --> 09:55.829
(sighs)
Hi.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.197
Jane, look, I'm so sorry.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.999
I don't care
what my parents say.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.934
No, no, no, it's not that.
Well, I mean,

10:00.968 --> 10:02.269
it's definitely that,
too, but...

10:02.302 --> 10:03.704
I'm worried about my dad.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.005
I left him a message
this morning,

10:05.038 --> 10:06.273
and I told him
that we were engaged,

10:06.306 --> 10:07.741
and he hasn't
called me back all day.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.142
And we want
to go check in on him,

10:09.176 --> 10:10.744
but he told us
to give him his space.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.079
Okay, I'll-I'll
swing by the condo

10:12.112 --> 10:13.413
and see what's
going on with him.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.115
Thank you. I love you.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.884
He's gonna go check on him.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.118
Good. I feel better.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.720
Hey, can you move

10:19.753 --> 10:21.021
those papers?
Pablo will be here any minute.

10:21.054 --> 10:24.391
Yeah, sure. Sorry.
I was just making sure

10:24.424 --> 10:27.194
that my chapters passed
the Bechdel test.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.899
Yeah, she sounds
like a hard-ass.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.234
Have you had any movement
with Michael's parents?

10:34.267 --> 10:36.436
No, and I'm
so frustrated,

10:36.469 --> 10:38.371
because I love him so much.

10:38.405 --> 10:41.174
(buzzer sounds)
But I don't know
how to prove that to them.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.710
(groans)

10:42.743 --> 10:43.711
Look who it is.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.245
Finally.
 Okay, good.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.247
Bechdel test, take two.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.182
Why aren't you dressed? Pablo's
gonna be here any minute.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.952
(buzzer sounds)
 Geez, this thing is tough.

10:58.926 --> 11:01.929
Ma, stop being
ridiculous.

11:08.902 --> 11:09.870
(both chuckle)

11:19.880 --> 11:23.383
Fine. What's
the undeniable proof?

11:29.422 --> 11:31.859
Afterwards, we will
consider sending him away.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.029
(sighs)

12:27.547 --> 12:29.917
JANE:
 Abuela, there are,
 like, 100 different

12:29.950 --> 12:32.219
environmental factors that
go into an early frost.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.327
(doorbell rings)
(gasps)

12:40.360 --> 12:41.795
He's here!
Come on, Abuela.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.296
No, no, no, no, no. Dame.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.876
Please
come in.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.545
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Okay, this could
 totally be explained

12:58.578 --> 13:00.547
by a fuse blowing
 or a power outage.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.082
(gasps)
 Or is it...

13:02.115 --> 13:04.985
the Curse
 of Pablo Alonso Segura?

13:11.058 --> 13:13.060
It's just our house. The other
houses on the street have power.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.302
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Not entirely true.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.306
Good question.
Let me go check on her.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.446
Stop.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.915
It's not a curse.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.116
You're being silly.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.353
Yes. And you're being rude.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.622
Now, that nice man travelled
a long way to see you

13:42.655 --> 13:44.624
and, yes, maybe
we shouldn't have invited him,

13:44.657 --> 13:46.493
but I read those chats,

13:46.526 --> 13:49.496
and you certainly wrote
pretty vividly

13:49.529 --> 13:51.498
about wanting to see him.

13:51.531 --> 13:54.634
So I'm gonna need you to come
out of this room right now.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.237
And I would change
because he's fine.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.345
Just one more minute.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.948
It'll be quick,

14:07.981 --> 14:09.349
painless,

14:09.382 --> 14:12.152
and when our death goes viral,

14:12.185 --> 14:13.453
we'll be famous.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.222
And they'll make a movie
about us,

14:15.255 --> 14:17.490
maybe.
 At this point, Rogelio's life

14:17.524 --> 14:20.060
actually did start
 to flash before him.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.229
*

14:24.397 --> 14:27.167
His first smile.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.502
*

14:31.371 --> 14:33.473
Wait, what?

14:33.506 --> 14:37.644
Oh, yeah.
 This part is really happening.

14:37.677 --> 14:40.647
And now's a good time to remind
 you that Jane's fiancÃ©

14:40.680 --> 14:42.449
is a detective.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.151
And remember,
 he was sent by Jane

14:44.184 --> 14:45.618
to see if Rogelio was okay.

14:45.652 --> 14:49.156
Huh. Since when
 does Rogelio not rush out

14:49.189 --> 14:51.458
to open his monthly
 Cosmetic Crate delivery?

15:06.706 --> 15:09.977
And here
 is where we left off.

15:18.718 --> 15:21.021
Lola, could we do this outside?

15:21.054 --> 15:25.158
The dramatic skyline, the
sound of the ocean behind us--

15:25.192 --> 15:27.427
it'll add more
production value.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.162
Please, please,
don't-don't let me die

15:29.196 --> 15:33.466
against a flat background lit
by unflattering light.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.317
Okay. We'll go outside...

15:50.350 --> 15:51.718
Drop the weapon.
Oh!

15:51.751 --> 15:52.452
Drop it.
Drop it.
No!

15:52.485 --> 15:53.386
(grunting)

15:53.420 --> 15:54.454
No.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.056
Let me go!
Calm down.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.190
Rogelio!

15:57.224 --> 15:58.458
It's over.
No!

15:58.491 --> 15:59.692
Rogelio!

15:59.726 --> 16:03.563
(shouting
indistinctly)
(exhales)

16:03.596 --> 16:06.299
(inhales deeply)

16:08.801 --> 16:12.372
*

17:06.858 --> 17:07.827
Jane!
(gasps)

17:07.859 --> 17:09.496
It's fine!

17:09.529 --> 17:11.298
Just the wind! Finish
what you were saying.

17:11.330 --> 17:12.699
(phone rings)

17:12.732 --> 17:15.268
Michael...

17:17.737 --> 17:19.739
Dad was kidnapped.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.449
Is there a particular concealer
you'd recommend

17:29.482 --> 17:31.484
for an injury of this kind?
Uh,

17:31.518 --> 17:32.819
concealer, like...

17:32.852 --> 17:35.122
Makeup. To cover up wounds.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.624
Surely I'm not the first
to ask this.
Dad!

17:37.657 --> 17:39.526
Oh, my God. Are you okay? Oh.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.760
Yes, I'm okay, I'm okay.

17:44.231 --> 17:47.600
Oh.
(exhales)

17:50.837 --> 17:53.673
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And then they remembered
 they were broken up.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.877
And this guy.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.447
My hero.
My best friend.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.783
And now my daughter's fiancÃ©.
I'm so happy for you two!

18:03.816 --> 18:05.752
WOMAN:
Oh... my...
God!

18:10.290 --> 18:12.492
Soledad, what are
you doing here?
I heard what happened.

18:12.525 --> 18:13.860
The news outlet
has it now.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.528
It's a huge story
everywhere.

18:15.562 --> 18:16.896
Really?
Oh, yeah.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.398
I'm getting calls
from big people.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.766
How about...
Not yet.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.501
Might we...
I'm putting out
feelers.

18:21.534 --> 18:22.735
JANE:
Who are they
talking about?

18:22.769 --> 18:24.637
JosÃ© DÃ­az-Balart
from Telemundo.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.639
It's your dad's dream
to be interviewed by him.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.908
Just don't tell the story to any
other news outlets, all right?

18:28.941 --> 18:31.778
Because JDB would need
an exclusive.
My lips

18:31.811 --> 18:35.215
are sealed.
But you can
talk to family.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.784
Are you okay?
What happened?

18:38.785 --> 18:40.753
I'm fine.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.922
I just want to put it behind me.

18:42.955 --> 18:46.259
Oh, my God.
1.3 million more

18:46.293 --> 18:48.495
Twitter followers.
I know.

18:48.528 --> 18:51.364
I know. Oh,
I can't even.
I can't even.

18:51.398 --> 18:54.534
I really can't even.
I can't even even can't even.

18:54.567 --> 18:57.570
I seriously can't even.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.673
Is she in there?

19:00.707 --> 19:01.941
Thank you.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.676
Good morning.

19:03.710 --> 19:07.314
What are you doing here?

19:07.347 --> 19:09.382
The band canceled
for the live music series.

19:09.416 --> 19:10.917
Weren't you copied
on the e-mails?

19:10.950 --> 19:12.585
I've called the agencies.
Now I have about...

19:12.619 --> 19:15.355
15 artists to listen to.
I can take care
of that.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.257
You just had twins.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.858
You heard what Dr. Grove said.
I'm been cleared

19:18.891 --> 19:21.328
to resume regular activities,
hence... (chuckles)

19:21.361 --> 19:23.863
Not every mother
has to stay home.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.732
I actually feel happy here.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.835
But, hey, if you want
to go upstairs, by all means.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.703
JANE:
 Well, excuse me.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.739
Who is the most handsome boy
in the whole world?

19:32.772 --> 19:36.209
Is it you, Mr. Sweetface?
(chewing sounds)

19:36.243 --> 19:38.878
Huh? Yes?
Maybe you should come with me

19:38.911 --> 19:40.580
to dinner
with Michael's parents later.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.482
Right?
'Cause nobody can resist you.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.818
(phone chimes)
Oh. Oh, what is this?

19:45.852 --> 19:48.288
An e-mail
from Professor Donaldson.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.489
Should we open it, Mateo?

19:49.522 --> 19:51.190
Should we?

19:52.559 --> 19:54.361
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 That's it?

19:54.394 --> 19:55.995
Yes. That was the whole e-mail.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.697
And now I have to
go meet with her.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.299
Which, heads up, I'm dreading.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.600
XIOMARA:
Relax, hon.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.902
She's obviously just
a really cold person.

20:05.672 --> 20:06.973
Keep up the good,
brave work.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.876
Thanks. Thanks so much.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.283
Come on in.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.919
So, I got your heads-up.
Yeah,
I never like

20:19.952 --> 20:21.554
you kids to be blindsided.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.723
Everyone's so, you know,
"sensitive" these days.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.592
But, yeah, not into it.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.795
So how can I address
your concerns?

20:28.828 --> 20:30.663
Because I do think, overall,

20:30.697 --> 20:32.665
the work passed
the Bechdel test.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.667
Well, yeah, big whoop.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.603
That's pretty baseline, right?

20:36.636 --> 20:38.638
Let me ask you
a question.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.973
What kind of a book
are you writing?

20:41.007 --> 20:43.510
Is it, you know, like,
a book for bored housewives?

20:43.543 --> 20:45.912
Or is it... about something?

20:45.945 --> 20:47.380
It should be noted
 that Jane found this

20:47.414 --> 20:48.581
more than slightly offensive.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.517
Both, I'm hoping.

20:50.550 --> 20:51.918
Well, then you better get back
to work.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.487
'Cause it's, you know, not now.

20:54.521 --> 20:55.755
Maybe put it
in context.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.458
Give it a "frame."

21:00.827 --> 21:03.496
DIRECTOR:
Move the frame to the left.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.943
Good.

21:16.976 --> 21:20.046
Now we go to soft focus
and reveal it's a dream.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.714
Cut!

21:24.851 --> 21:27.019
Rogelio.
Are you okay?
Mm-hmm?

21:27.053 --> 21:29.422
You're not kissing with
your usual passion.

21:29.456 --> 21:30.690
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR (coughs):
 Tongue.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.759
Yes. I'm fine.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.027
I'm fine.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.096
Jane. Hi.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.031
What a surprise.

21:39.065 --> 21:41.668
Oh. Hey, Dad.
I just came by

21:41.701 --> 21:43.536
to check in,
see how you're doing.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.572
Incredible.

21:45.605 --> 21:48.841
I feel that I'm accessing this
whole new set of emotions

21:48.875 --> 21:51.511
and their corresponding
facial expressions.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.513
I'm more...

21:53.546 --> 21:55.548
wounded now.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.451
But sexy wounded.

21:58.485 --> 22:00.720
Probably that's what
JDB responded to.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.855
JosÃ© DÃ­az-Balart?

22:02.889 --> 22:05.057
Fine, you pried it out of me.

22:05.091 --> 22:08.661
Yes, I will be sharing the
harrowing tale of my kidnapping

22:08.695 --> 22:10.730
with him exclusively.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.665
Oh, wow.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.867
It means that I'll be late to
your engagement party, though.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.135
Is that okay?

22:16.168 --> 22:18.738
Don't even think about it.
But, Dad,

22:18.771 --> 22:21.140
I haven't even
heard what happened.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.742
D-Do you want to tell me, maybe?

22:22.775 --> 22:25.645
I do.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.782
Bu-But I also
want it to be fresh,

22:29.816 --> 22:31.784
so I don't seem rehearsed,
you know?

22:31.818 --> 22:34.654
Is that it? Because
we haven't even talked.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.789
I-I'm sorry that I was late
to your premiere.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.658
Oh, stop it. No, I'm fine.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.060
I just want to move forward.

22:41.093 --> 22:43.430
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Which Jane understood,
 after all.

22:43.463 --> 22:46.165
Which brings us here, now.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.900
So, I-I just wanted
to say thank you

22:47.934 --> 22:49.168
for agreeing to come to dinner.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.803
And honestly,

22:50.837 --> 22:52.572
I understand
where you're coming from,

22:52.605 --> 22:54.173
how it looks...
It looks like

22:54.206 --> 22:57.076
you fell in love with someone
else and dumped our son.

22:57.109 --> 22:59.111
Right.

22:59.145 --> 23:01.414
And I know
it seems like that,

23:01.448 --> 23:03.650
but just to explain myself
a little,

23:03.683 --> 23:06.553
I was accidentally
artificially inseminated.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.521
My whole life
was upside down.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.490
And so you left the one person
who stood beside you.

23:10.523 --> 23:12.058
You threw him out like a...

23:12.091 --> 23:14.160
Dirty tissue.
Exactly.

23:14.193 --> 23:15.862
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 On the bright side,

23:15.895 --> 23:18.064
these two
 are really getting along.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.966
How do we know
you won't do it again?

23:19.999 --> 23:22.068
Guys, go easy.

23:22.101 --> 23:23.936
It's okay.
It's fine.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.805
You can ask me
anything you want.

23:25.838 --> 23:28.074
And yes,
I left Michael.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.442
And I regret it.

23:29.476 --> 23:32.745
And I would
never do it again.

23:32.779 --> 23:35.848
Were you dating them both
at the same time?

23:35.882 --> 23:36.883
As soon as I realized
I had feelings

23:36.916 --> 23:38.551
for Rafael, I told Michael.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.620
Yeah, and then threw him aside,
no second thoughts.

23:40.653 --> 23:41.888
Well, I-I didn't
want to lead him on.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.089
How long did you wait

23:43.122 --> 23:44.691
before getting together
with Rafael?

23:44.724 --> 23:46.158
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Whoa. This must be

23:46.192 --> 23:47.927
where Michael gets his
 interrogation skills.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.999
Well, that isn't the point,
I told him...

23:53.032 --> 23:54.033
How long, Jane?

23:54.066 --> 23:56.435
That same night.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.838
That same night?

23:58.871 --> 24:00.172
And now you want my son

24:00.206 --> 24:01.774
to help raise
this other guy's kid?

24:01.808 --> 24:03.075
Enough.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.811
This is not
some other guy's kid.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.513
This is Mateo. And I love him,

24:06.546 --> 24:08.548
and I love Jane. Way too much

24:08.581 --> 24:10.249
to be putting up
with this disrespect.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.884
Come on,
we're leaving.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.204
Abuela, enough. (sighs)
What am I supposed to do?

24:32.238 --> 24:33.973
Michael's parents don't like me.

24:37.043 --> 24:38.144
Ma, come on, it's Jane.

24:38.177 --> 24:39.612
What?
Nothing.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.080
Just that...

24:41.113 --> 24:42.915
you have a compulsive need
to be liked.

24:42.949 --> 24:44.050
I do not.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.184
Jane.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.787
I don't.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.822
I just want my freaking
in-laws to like me.

24:49.856 --> 24:53.693
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And her freakin' advisor.

24:53.726 --> 24:57.530
MARLENE:
 What's the context?
 What's the frame?

25:17.316 --> 25:18.685
RAFAEL:
 So, was it any good?

25:18.718 --> 25:20.653
Ugh. No idea.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.021
Honestly, my brain is fried,

25:22.054 --> 25:24.924
but there's a frame.
They are

25:24.957 --> 25:27.159
beautiful, Raf.
Thank you.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.261
Are you ready to have a playdate
with your sisters? (whooshes)

25:29.295 --> 25:30.997
Oh. (chuckles)

25:31.030 --> 25:33.933
I'll leave you to it.
I got to go grade papers.

25:33.966 --> 25:36.202
Oh, um, can I ask you
a question, actually?

25:36.235 --> 25:39.005
It's about Petra.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.608
I'm worried she's not really
bonding with the babies.

25:41.641 --> 25:43.810
What do you mean?
Well, she's not
holding them, really.

25:43.843 --> 25:46.312
And she's working already,
and I can't bring it up

25:46.345 --> 25:48.047
without her accusing me
of treating her

25:48.080 --> 25:49.749
like a 1950s housewife.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.117
Is that normal?

25:51.150 --> 25:52.752
I don't know.
I mean, everybody's

25:52.785 --> 25:54.320
experience is different, right?

25:54.353 --> 25:56.756
I mean, I became a shut-in.
M-My mom had to basically

25:56.789 --> 25:58.224
force me out of the house.

25:58.257 --> 26:00.827
Yeah, well, the mom thing
isn't really an option.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.929
So, um...

26:02.962 --> 26:05.632
maybe you'll
have to give her the push?

26:05.665 --> 26:06.999
It'll happen.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.300
And when they bond-- I mean,

26:08.334 --> 26:10.102
that mother-child
thing is intense.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.605
Isn't it? Isn't it, Mateo?

26:14.674 --> 26:16.676
(phone dings)
Say "Bye, Mommy."

26:18.745 --> 26:21.380
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Yup. It sure is.

26:21.413 --> 26:24.250
Slight change of plans:
I'm on my way to Fort Myers.

26:24.283 --> 26:25.652
What?

26:25.685 --> 26:26.953
Michael's parents left.

26:26.986 --> 26:28.387
They said that
they weren't coming

26:28.420 --> 26:29.989
to the engagement party,
so I'm going there.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.090
Jane.

26:32.158 --> 26:33.325
What?

26:33.359 --> 26:35.394
It's only 112 more miles.

26:35.427 --> 26:38.798
This is crazy.
So they don't like you.

26:38.831 --> 26:40.032
It's not about them liking me!

26:41.400 --> 26:42.802
Okay, well, it kind of is,

26:42.835 --> 26:44.336
but it's about Michael, too.

26:44.370 --> 26:47.139
I mean, he wants
his family there.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.742
And plus, you know, I-I get
why they're protective.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.944
I get the parent-child bond.

26:51.978 --> 26:54.781
So I just want to appeal
to Mrs. Cordero as a mother.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.017
MRS. CORDERO:
 Jane, really,

26:58.050 --> 26:59.686
this isn't a good time.
No, no, no, please,

26:59.719 --> 27:01.287
l-let me just say one thing.
Please.

27:01.320 --> 27:05.257
I am so sorry. And you know
what, I know how you feel.

27:05.291 --> 27:09.028
If anyone broke Mateo's heart,
oh, my God. Oh, my God.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.698
Right now...
I just-I just want one more
chance to prove to you

27:11.731 --> 27:14.333
how much I love your son.
And I do. That's why I'm here.

27:14.366 --> 27:16.669
Because if you don't
come, you'll hurt him.

27:16.703 --> 27:20.940
And I know you don't want
that. No mother wants that.

27:20.973 --> 27:23.309
I'll think about it.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.778
And if you'll excuse me...

27:25.812 --> 27:27.814
I really should
get back to my book club.

27:28.815 --> 27:30.216
Your...

27:33.953 --> 27:37.089
Sorry about that.

27:37.123 --> 27:41.093
I-If it makes any difference,
I loved that book, too.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.065
Okay.

27:46.098 --> 27:47.333
(knocking)

27:47.366 --> 27:49.401
Hey.

27:49.435 --> 27:52.338
Hi. (giggles)

27:52.371 --> 27:55.474
I heard you paid a little
visit to my mom's book club.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.476
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.478
I didn't know they were
all gonna be sitting there.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.347
No, don't apologize.
It worked.

28:01.380 --> 28:02.815
My parents are coming
to the party.

28:02.849 --> 28:05.117
Apparently

28:05.151 --> 28:07.486
the, uh, book club ladies
were really feeling you.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.756
Yeah, well, I mean,
those are my people.

28:09.789 --> 28:11.824
Thank you for doing that.

28:11.858 --> 28:14.193
Of course. Family matters.

28:14.226 --> 28:16.195
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah, yes, Family Matters.

28:16.228 --> 28:19.265
It wasn't just a terrific
 Friday night TV staple.

28:19.298 --> 28:23.135
It was also a mantra Rafael
 was leaning on in this moment.

28:23.169 --> 28:24.336
So...

28:24.370 --> 28:25.404
tell me about yourself.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.039
I'm not talkative.

28:27.073 --> 28:29.141
Anything else?

28:29.175 --> 28:30.242
Nope.

28:30.276 --> 28:32.311
How's the food?

28:32.344 --> 28:34.080
Mm.

28:34.113 --> 28:35.347
Okay, man, come on,

28:35.381 --> 28:36.983
I'm just trying
to get to know you.

28:38.918 --> 28:41.053
Then ask the question
you really want to know.

28:43.355 --> 28:45.157
Did you know our mother
was a crime lord?

28:45.191 --> 28:46.959
No. Did you?

28:46.993 --> 28:49.161
No. But I'm not the one
who disappeared

28:49.195 --> 28:51.430
after she was exposed.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.199
And I didn't have tunnels
under my hotel

28:53.232 --> 28:54.801
where people did
illegal surgeries.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.205
Where were you?

28:59.238 --> 29:00.807
You really want to know?

29:00.840 --> 29:02.408
I do.

29:02.441 --> 29:04.176
Fine.

29:04.210 --> 29:06.212
Let's go.

29:09.181 --> 29:11.818
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Wait. No. What did Michael say?

29:11.851 --> 29:14.120
Don't follow him anywhere.

29:15.254 --> 29:18.090
And yet, there he goes.

29:18.124 --> 29:20.392
Right this way.
So, you can prepare here.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.328
Sorry there's not more room.

29:22.361 --> 29:25.231
Are you kidding? It's like
four cubano trucks in here.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.001
(gasps) Ooh,

29:29.035 --> 29:31.037
sexy, Ma.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.542
And you sure it's not
for your date after?

29:36.575 --> 29:38.544
Hmm?
You're gonna lose

29:38.577 --> 29:41.413
that sweater, right? And show
Pablo that hot little bod?

29:41.447 --> 29:43.215
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 It's safe to say this

29:43.249 --> 29:45.952
conversation fails
 the Bechdel test miserably.

29:45.985 --> 29:48.220
(phone buzzes)

29:48.254 --> 29:50.389
Hello?

29:50.422 --> 29:51.991
What?

29:52.024 --> 29:53.960
Oh, no.

29:53.993 --> 29:56.495
Yeah, I'll be there.

29:56.528 --> 29:59.031
Be there? Where are you going?
The party's gonna start.

29:59.065 --> 30:02.034
And I'll be back as soon as
I can, but that was Dad's agent.

30:05.872 --> 30:08.274
What-what are you doing here?

30:08.307 --> 30:10.809
I heard you were
having a hard time.

30:12.278 --> 30:15.281
What's going on?

30:15.314 --> 30:18.284
I just...

30:18.317 --> 30:20.452
I don't think
I can do this interview.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.022
And you don't have to
if you don't want to.

30:23.055 --> 30:25.424
No, but I do want to,
that's the point.

30:25.457 --> 30:27.426
It's one of my #LifeGoals.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.295
I always wanted
to open my heart and soul

30:29.328 --> 30:30.930
to JosÃ© DÃ­az-Balart.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.264
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Who doesn't?

30:32.298 --> 30:34.033
But I don't know.

30:34.066 --> 30:36.302
It's just,
every time I think about

30:36.335 --> 30:40.139
saying it out loud...

30:40.172 --> 30:41.607
I get choked up.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.043
And not like a single tear

30:44.076 --> 30:46.178
glistening down my cheek thing,

30:46.212 --> 30:47.914
but like...

30:47.947 --> 30:51.050
Oh, Dad, of course
you're going to cry.

30:51.083 --> 30:53.585
It's a really traumatic thing
that happened.

30:53.619 --> 30:56.455
I don't want people
to see me as a victim.

30:56.488 --> 30:59.926
I want to seem like a powerful,
extraordinary actor.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.227
You can be both.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.062
But what if people
make fun of me--

31:03.095 --> 31:05.331
memes, GIFs?

31:05.364 --> 31:06.899
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Or is it JIFs?

31:06.933 --> 31:08.901
Well, not everybody's
gonna like you.

31:08.935 --> 31:10.903
Which is a lesson
I've been learning.

31:10.937 --> 31:12.671
Well, that's not
too helpful to me,

31:12.704 --> 31:15.641
because I'm trying to build
a social media dynasty.

31:15.674 --> 31:20.679
Well, personally, I don't think
anybody's gonna make fun of you

31:20.712 --> 31:23.615
if you're honest and vulnerable,
and that's all you can do.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.952
What if I can't
get through it?

31:25.985 --> 31:28.454
You want to practice with me?

31:28.487 --> 31:31.257
No. You have to go
to your engagement party.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.392
This is more important.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.629
Now what happened?

31:37.663 --> 31:40.099
(sniffles)

31:40.132 --> 31:43.169
I thought
I was going to die, Jane.

31:43.202 --> 31:45.504
Oh, Dad.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.439
Oh.

31:49.441 --> 31:52.211
Yes. Say good-bye.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.546
Good night.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.552
She's still with her dad.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.354
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Let's move on, shall we?

32:02.388 --> 32:05.424
I could use a breather
 from all this tension.

32:09.228 --> 32:11.563
So much for taking a breather.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.338
Don't bother. No service.

32:19.371 --> 32:22.374
Come on.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You really
 shouldn't go, Rafael.

32:22.408 --> 32:24.676
You heard what Michael said.
 Not alone!
You coming?

32:24.710 --> 32:27.379
And with Michael's words
 ringing in his ears,

32:27.413 --> 32:29.248
Rafael refused
 to get on the boat!

32:29.281 --> 32:31.050
Let's go.

32:33.052 --> 32:35.054
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ugh. Well, it was worth a try.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.528
Tonight, we're here with
international telenovela star

32:42.561 --> 32:46.165
Rogelio de la Vega, and the
story you're about to hear,

32:46.198 --> 32:50.669
well, it's straight out
of a telenovela, honestly.

32:50.702 --> 32:53.239
I know. It-it really is.

32:53.272 --> 32:54.440
But then again, you know,

32:54.473 --> 32:56.775
sometimes truth is
stranger than fiction.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.245
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I'll say.

32:59.278 --> 33:01.380
DEREK: Be up in a second.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 You'll recall,

33:01.413 --> 33:04.116
we left Rafael on a boat
 alone with his brother.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.984
No problem.

33:07.686 --> 33:10.422
(creaking, thud)

33:13.459 --> 33:15.727
Did you think it was a gun?

33:15.761 --> 33:18.297
No.

33:22.068 --> 33:24.403
So...

33:24.436 --> 33:26.038
where were you?

33:26.072 --> 33:27.406
Right here

33:27.439 --> 33:29.175
on this boat.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.510
In the middle of the ocean.

33:33.079 --> 33:35.747
I heard about my mom...

33:35.781 --> 33:37.816
our mom.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.786
They were seizing assets.

33:42.188 --> 33:43.722
I freaked out.

33:43.755 --> 33:45.557
I didn't know what to do.

33:45.591 --> 33:49.095
They were taking everything.

33:49.128 --> 33:51.430
Okay. And?

33:51.463 --> 33:54.066
And I sat out here, man.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.835
Thought about things.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.504
My dad, for instance.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.739
Ran half marathons
twice a year,

34:00.772 --> 34:02.741
died of a heart attack
out of the blue.

34:02.774 --> 34:05.844
Did she kill him?

34:05.877 --> 34:08.080
Things like that.

34:08.114 --> 34:11.683
Thought about taking the plunge
myself, briefly.

34:11.717 --> 34:15.786
'Cause I suddenly
had no family.

34:17.556 --> 34:20.626
But then I punked out

34:20.659 --> 34:24.062
and headed back
to good old Miami.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.768
But you do, though.

34:33.405 --> 34:34.773
Have family.

34:39.811 --> 34:43.614
So, you gonna pour that Scotch,
or what?

34:43.649 --> 34:45.351
Yeah.

34:46.552 --> 34:48.554
JANE:
 Hi.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.188
Hi! Hi! Oh, I love you.

34:50.222 --> 34:51.822
I'm so sorry.
Thank you for coming.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.592
Thank you. Thank
you. Thank you.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.194
Michael, hi.
Hi.

34:55.226 --> 34:57.396
I'm sorry I'm late.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.598
Oh.
Me, too.

34:59.631 --> 35:01.633
(laughs)

35:01.667 --> 35:04.603
I'll go inside. I'll give you
guys some privacy. I'll just...

35:06.772 --> 35:08.174
How are your parents?

35:08.207 --> 35:10.909
My mom is not as mad
as when she found out

35:10.942 --> 35:12.811
my dad slept
with his dental hygienist.

35:12.844 --> 35:14.380
But it's a point
of reference?

35:14.413 --> 35:15.747
It's definitely
a point of reference.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.349
Oh. Okay.

35:17.383 --> 35:19.685
I'm going in.
Okay.

35:22.388 --> 35:24.256
Michael, Patricia, hi.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.258
I am so sorry
I missed the party.

35:26.292 --> 35:28.694
My dad had
an emergency.
We heard.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.429
The point is,
you missed it.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.763
After you made
a real big deal

35:31.797 --> 35:33.232
about how important
it was to Michael.

35:33.265 --> 35:34.533
MICHAEL SR.:
And once again,

35:34.566 --> 35:36.235
someone else comes in first.

35:36.268 --> 35:37.403
I told you both not
to say anything.

35:37.436 --> 35:39.938
Michael, it's fine. It's fine.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.674
I know, but my dad really
needed me tonight.

35:44.443 --> 35:48.180
Okay. Forget it.

35:48.214 --> 35:49.948
I'm sorry you don't like me,
but you know what?

35:49.981 --> 35:52.718
Your son understands
why I wasn't here,

35:52.751 --> 35:54.553
so I'm cool.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.588
And I really hope that
you'll learn to live with me,

35:56.622 --> 35:58.190
because I'm not going anywhere.

36:00.626 --> 36:02.194
If we do attend
the wedding,

36:02.228 --> 36:03.795
it'll be for his
sake, not yours.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.697
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 It should be noted

36:05.731 --> 36:07.833
that the people-pleasing side
 of Jane wanted to attempt

36:07.866 --> 36:09.968
one last ditch charm offensive,
 but instead, she said...

36:10.001 --> 36:12.438
Noted.

36:12.471 --> 36:16.442
You know,
I'm turning over a new leaf.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.710
Who cares if
people like me?

36:18.744 --> 36:20.446
Cheers to that!

36:20.479 --> 36:21.947
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

36:21.980 --> 36:24.550
That's what I'm talking
about. 100% over it.

36:24.583 --> 36:26.985
My new motto--
take me or leave me.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.755
(phone chimes)
Mm.

36:29.788 --> 36:32.224
(gasps)
Oh, my God, oh,
my God, my advisor.

36:32.258 --> 36:34.526
She just e-mailed
me, "Heads up."

36:35.894 --> 36:37.429
"I liked your material."

36:37.463 --> 36:39.398
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

36:39.431 --> 36:40.899
She liked my material!

36:40.932 --> 36:43.602
Yeah. Get it. Work, work.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.871
But you don't care?
Mom, baby steps.

36:45.904 --> 36:47.906
(phone chimes, Jane gasps)
Oh.

36:47.939 --> 36:51.443
What?

36:51.477 --> 36:52.811
Oh, yeah, well,
you know what?

36:52.844 --> 36:54.846
I'll take it. Yeah. Uh.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.249
(phone buzzing)

36:57.283 --> 36:58.850
Oh, be right back.
It's Rafael.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.486
He was meeting
his brother. Sorry.

37:00.519 --> 37:02.020
Look, I think
Derek's telling the truth.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.555
I don't think he knew.

37:03.589 --> 37:04.923
Wait. What are you
talking about?

37:04.956 --> 37:06.525
You can't know that already.

37:06.558 --> 37:07.893
Well, I do.

37:07.926 --> 37:09.461
What?! Stop.

37:09.495 --> 37:11.029
You are being played.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.432
And you are entitled
to your own opinion,

37:13.465 --> 37:16.368
but this... this is my family.

37:17.536 --> 37:19.738
So investigate
all you want, man.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.873
I'm done.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.009
Thanks, man.

37:24.042 --> 37:25.611
Well, I meant it.

37:25.644 --> 37:27.045
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Hmm.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.914
I don't know if I like this.

37:28.947 --> 37:30.549
I got to run.

37:32.918 --> 37:35.321
This, on the other hand,
 I'm all for.

37:35.354 --> 37:37.523
Hi.
Hi.

37:37.556 --> 37:40.058
Where are Wilma and Helga?

37:40.091 --> 37:41.793
I let them go,

37:41.827 --> 37:43.795
just for a night.

37:43.829 --> 37:47.032
I thought it would be good
to have a bonding night.

37:47.065 --> 37:48.634
Just us.

37:48.667 --> 37:50.602
As a family.

37:50.636 --> 37:52.804
And you don't have
to change a single diaper.

37:52.838 --> 37:54.806
Come here.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.808
Come here.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.677
Here, hold Elsa.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.812
You want to go
to your mommy.

38:00.846 --> 38:02.514
Come here.

38:02.548 --> 38:04.716
That.

38:08.387 --> 38:10.088
How can you even tell
which is which?

38:10.121 --> 38:12.591
Had Helga put an
"X" on her foot.

38:12.624 --> 38:15.093
(baby cooing)

38:15.126 --> 38:17.729
I've been having
a little trouble.

38:17.763 --> 38:19.698
I'm not sure this is for me.

38:19.731 --> 38:20.966
It is.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.834
I just think
part of the problem is

38:22.868 --> 38:24.570
that you've been avoiding them.

38:24.603 --> 38:26.472
(baby crying)

38:26.505 --> 38:30.476
Uh-oh. Someone's got
to get a diaper changed.

38:58.937 --> 39:02.774
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Well, there's really no way
 to sugarcoat it.

39:10.782 --> 39:12.784
Ah.

39:24.630 --> 39:26.932
Ah.

39:42.648 --> 39:44.450
Oh.

39:47.453 --> 39:49.521
(violin plays)
Ah.

40:07.573 --> 40:09.541
(tango music plays)

40:24.055 --> 40:26.191
Michael left?

40:26.224 --> 40:28.026
Yeah, he has
an early morning.

40:28.059 --> 40:29.528
Where's Abuela?

40:29.561 --> 40:32.531
Still out with Pablo.
Ooh! Nice.

40:32.564 --> 40:33.999
(creaking)

40:34.032 --> 40:36.602
Hey, did you hear that?

40:36.635 --> 40:39.705
(tango music playing)

40:52.918 --> 40:54.753
(creaking)
Wait. I hear it now.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.021
Is that what they mean
when they say

40:56.054 --> 40:57.222
that a house is settling
or whatever?

40:57.255 --> 40:59.958
*

41:05.263 --> 41:07.733
Maybe it's the air conditioning?
(rattling)

41:07.766 --> 41:11.603
*

41:15.907 --> 41:17.776
Oh!

41:17.809 --> 41:19.711
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, dear.

41:19.745 --> 41:21.747
Maybe there is something to
 this curse business after all.
