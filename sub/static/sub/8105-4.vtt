00:14.640 --> 00:16.599
Hey!

00:30.197 --> 00:31.823
Dr. Sebastian.

00:34.827 --> 00:36.703
Two pallets of antibiotics
for tuberculosis.

00:36.829 --> 00:38.705
We've got six pallets
worth of patients.

00:38.831 --> 00:41.749
Stoia Tucker
needs a math lesson.
I'm headed back tomorrow.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.001
Hey! Hey!

00:48.590 --> 00:51.551
Come on, come on.
Come on, kids,
let the truck through.

00:58.517 --> 01:01.686
Move those boxes
quick, quick. Let's move!
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

01:01.812 --> 01:03.813
Let's go!
Let's go, man! Hurry!

01:05.524 --> 01:09.527
I've got some very special
medicine here. It's from
Hershey, Pennsylvania.

01:10.279 --> 01:11.863
One per person.
One per person.

01:11.989 --> 01:13.865
Let's calm down, kids.
Wait, wait.

01:22.875 --> 01:26.711
Help! Help! Dr. Sebastian!
Come quickly!

01:26.837 --> 01:31.340
My son, he fell. He fell
on this log. We were just
waiting for his friends.

01:37.973 --> 01:41.851
I got no breath sounds
on the left. Give me that.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.653
Yeah, he's gonna be okay.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.407
The fall
didn't cause him
to drop a lung.

01:56.533 --> 01:59.952
The lung caused him to fall.
TB chewed it up.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.705
He'll be lucky
to live another year.

02:02.831 --> 02:06.292
This is Sarni.
I picked up the tab
for the back brace myself.

02:06.418 --> 02:07.627
The funny thing is,

02:07.753 --> 02:10.087
is that the brace cost more
than the medicine

02:10.214 --> 02:12.882
that would have prevented her
from needing it.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.717
It's your medicine.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.762
All of the antibiotics
that we need are right here

02:17.888 --> 02:20.723
in your warehouses,
in your factories.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.726
- We provide over 10,000 doses a year.
- Which is not enough.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.020
You know we'd love to do more,
but our hands are tied.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.396
New car, Jerry?

02:27.523 --> 02:28.940
I saw it on the way in, looks beautiful.

02:29.066 --> 02:29.899
Don't make this personal.

02:30.025 --> 02:32.735
All the way from Germany, too.
I know that's a lot
of red tape.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.446
I'm not like you.
I'm not ashamed
of making a living.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.698
And I know you didn't become
a chem major for the money.

02:37.825 --> 02:41.244
Now, you want the same things
that I want. You just...

02:42.704 --> 02:44.705
You have to...
You just have
to push a little...

02:44.832 --> 02:46.958
You have to push
a little bit harder...

02:47.084 --> 02:49.418
- Harder for it.
- Sebastian?

02:56.134 --> 02:57.718
Call 911.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.595
Is he okay?

02:59.721 --> 03:01.848
Isn't someone here a doctor?

03:40.637 --> 03:43.890
Selling subscriptions?
I heard 20 and you get
a new bike.

03:44.016 --> 03:47.727
Dr. Sebastian Charles collapsed during
a presentation at Stoia Tucker.

03:47.853 --> 03:51.105
Really? Crushed under the weight
of his own ego?

03:51.231 --> 03:54.191
Wow!
Is there nobody you admire?

03:54.318 --> 03:58.112
Well, there is this gal I met
in Nam who could blow out
a candle without using...

03:58.238 --> 04:00.072
He thinks it's TB.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.909
Good thing he's not the syphilis expert.

04:03.035 --> 04:06.120
- He wants a second opinion.
- Second to his own. Okay.

04:07.205 --> 04:10.082
- It's not TB.
- What is it?

04:10.208 --> 04:11.626
Oh, you want specifics?

04:12.711 --> 04:15.546
Lemma, big Knicks fan.

04:17.549 --> 04:19.800
You've never had an episode
like this before?

04:19.927 --> 04:22.261
No. He died last month.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.889
Stupidly tried to share
his meds with his cousin,

04:25.015 --> 04:27.600
and they only had
enough for one.

04:27.726 --> 04:30.186
Dr. House,
I'm Sebastian Charles.

04:31.229 --> 04:34.732
Patients aren't usually
part of the diagnostic process.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.777
Well, I'm a doctor.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.862
Listen, I know you guys
don't make a lot of money...

04:39.988 --> 04:41.489
I wrote your people a check last month.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.116
Oh, well. Write us another one.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.535
- Talk to Chase. He's rich.
- My dad, not me.

04:46.662 --> 04:49.038
Every minute
four people die of TB.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.666
Wow!
How can you sleep at night?

04:51.792 --> 04:54.251
There's people dying in Africa
of a disease that we cured over...

04:54.378 --> 04:56.921
Yeah, I know.
I saw the concert.

04:57.047 --> 05:01.342
Seriously. Let's see, you sleep six
hours. That means every night you kill

05:01.468 --> 05:03.094
1,440 people.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.179
I guess you got to get
some sleep, but come on.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.766
If you'd stayed up another 10 minutes,
you could have saved 40 lives.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.434
Do you send notes
to the families
in the morning?

05:10.560 --> 05:12.228
That's gonna take
at least 10 minutes.

05:12.354 --> 05:15.272
So that's another
40 dead, another 40 notes.

05:15.399 --> 05:18.109
Why don't you go wrack yourself
with guilt in your own room?

05:18.235 --> 05:21.362
No, thanks. I'll stay.
I'd like to hear the differential.

05:21.488 --> 05:25.616
Dr. Cameron, tell the doctor
why it's not a good idea
for the patient to be here.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.910
He's an immunologist
and a TB expert.

05:28.036 --> 05:31.122
That'll be very useful
if we need somebody to say the words,

05:31.248 --> 05:32.999
"I think it's TB".

05:34.668 --> 05:36.002
What is that?

05:36.128 --> 05:38.421
Oh, that. I'm sorry,
that's my body powder.

05:38.547 --> 05:40.715
It's the only thing I've found
that works in the Sahara.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.259
I'm kind of used to it.
I don't even notice it.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.886
Who thinks it smells like
an elephant-dung smoothie?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.430
It smells okay to me.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.474
That is exactly why the patient
shouldn't be in the room.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.810
If you can't tell a man
that his cologne makes you want to puke,

05:52.936 --> 05:54.645
how are you gonna tell him
that he's an idiot?

05:54.771 --> 05:56.522
He's not an idiot.

05:56.648 --> 05:59.567
Sure, you say that now,
while he's in the room.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.069
Look, I don't have time for this.
It's TB.

06:02.195 --> 06:05.114
Nope.
The symptoms are too varied.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.325
Well, if you haven't seen
10,000 cases, I agree
that's what you'd think.

06:08.452 --> 06:09.744
I told you he's an idiot.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.788
- You said you wanted a second opinion.
- No, actually,

06:12.914 --> 06:14.290
my backers
wanted a second opinion.

06:14.416 --> 06:18.294
Yeah, doesn't look good
if you drop dead while wearing
your shoe sponsor's logo.

06:18.420 --> 06:21.464
It's TB and I'm not dying.
I'm gonna want you
to plant a PPD

06:21.590 --> 06:26.093
and induce a sputum to confirm
the TB. Imaging studies will
determine the progress,

06:26.219 --> 06:29.555
and I think we should probably
take a CT scan of my lungs

06:29.681 --> 06:33.684
- just so that nobody second guesses us.
- Wouldn't want that.

06:35.312 --> 06:38.814
Hello? No,
I'm feeling much better.

06:40.859 --> 06:43.944
Well, what you can do is,
you can get your board to approve

06:44.071 --> 06:46.697
the increased
med shipments that... Sorry.

06:48.533 --> 06:52.244
No, don't, don't, don't try.
No, don't do your best.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.915
Just get it done, okay?

06:58.251 --> 07:01.128
That's Stoia Tucker,
and they're the nice
pharmaceutical company.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.297
I'm sorry,
but it's against hospital regs.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.840
Oh, I need the phone.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.843
Why don't we focus on getting
you better right now?

07:07.969 --> 07:11.138
- What'll you do, throw me out?
- No, just the phone.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.140
Sorry. We've got an emergency.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.517
Got to go.

07:15.310 --> 07:19.480
- There's a phone in your room.
- Yeah, I figured that there would be.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.399
Right. I just thought...

07:23.193 --> 07:26.654
It's not like the hospitals
you may be used to in Africa.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.865
I don't know
what the facilities
were like, so...

07:29.991 --> 07:31.117
Thank you.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.120
You're welcome.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.830
And thanks for that check.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.207
I should go.

07:42.963 --> 07:47.258
The nameless poor have a face,
and it's a pompous white man.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.846
Yeah, what a jerk,
saving all those lives
like that.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.014
What's the emergency?

07:54.141 --> 07:56.642
I can't remember
how to do "walk the dog".

07:56.768 --> 07:59.103
The guy's sick, maybe dying.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.814
And you've forgotten all about
doing a differential
diagnosis.

08:01.940 --> 08:05.109
- You just sent us off to test him...
- Well, I had to get him out of there.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.111
Now we can all sit around
and call him an idiot.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.113
- Who wants to go first?
- He's right.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.574
Tuberculosis could present
hundreds of different ways.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.285
Well, by that logic,
everyone in the hospital
should be treated.

08:14.411 --> 08:17.496
Not everybody in the hospital
has been exposed to it
for the last 20 years.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.248
TB takes years to kill you.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.083
Two weeks ago,
he was perfectly healthy.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.793
Now he's got a whiteboard
full of symptoms.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.962
What about something metabolic?

08:25.088 --> 08:27.381
Welcome aboard
the Good Ship Ass-Kisser.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.800
Nice day for a sail.
Pucker up, me hearties.

08:29.926 --> 08:34.138
It's not metabolic.
Kidney, liver and thyroid
are all normal. No diabetes.

08:34.264 --> 08:37.600
- What about his heart?
- Obviously big as all outdoors.

08:37.726 --> 08:41.270
Abnormal heart rhythm.
Wave forms
show PR variability.

08:43.064 --> 08:44.607
It's subtle, but it's there.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.775
You think it's his heart?
Sick sinus syndrome?

08:46.902 --> 08:49.695
Loose throttle.
Sometimes beats too fast,
sometimes too slow.

08:49.821 --> 08:52.615
- Causing him to pass out.
- It would account for the episode.

08:52.741 --> 08:55.117
I'll put him on telemetry,
do a stress test
and an echocardiogram.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.912
Treat him like every
other hospital patient.

08:58.038 --> 09:02.249
I want to see that pious,
body-powdered tush
hanging out of his gown.

09:07.839 --> 09:10.299
Could you give me a hand
with this thing?

09:12.761 --> 09:16.263
I don't recall
asking for a stress test
or an echocardiogram.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.432
What are you gonna do,
walk out?

09:19.351 --> 09:22.353
Corporate sponsors
aren't gonna like that.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.023
I need your forearm.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.484
What's House thinking?

09:29.361 --> 09:30.819
Sick sinus syndrome.

09:30.946 --> 09:33.280
Well, that's a lot
more serious than TB.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.491
Is that a PPD?

09:35.617 --> 09:37.534
If it changes color
in the next 48 hours...

09:37.661 --> 09:42.122
Yeah, if House doesn't think
it's TB, why would he have
you test for that?

09:42.249 --> 09:45.334
Just covering
all his bases, I guess.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.710
Uh-huh.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.006
He doesn't seem
like a guy who does that.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.428
We have you scheduled for a 10:30 echo.

09:56.554 --> 09:57.429
Good for you.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.062
Every minute that we refuse
to love one another,

10:05.188 --> 10:07.481
another puppy
cries another tear.

10:08.191 --> 10:11.026
You're just mad
because he's closer
to a Nobel Prize than you are.

10:11.152 --> 10:15.281
And yet I've nailed
more Swedish babes.
Crazy, crazy world.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.492
It's not just a trip
to Stockholm, you know.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.744
It comes with a cash prize.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.288
Seriously?

10:22.414 --> 10:25.416
No wonder everybody's
going after that peace thing.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.251
He cures thousands
of people every year.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.128
You cure what, 30?

10:29.254 --> 10:33.215
McDonald's makes a better
hamburger than your mother
because they make more?

10:33.341 --> 10:35.050
Oh, I see.

10:35.176 --> 10:39.471
So you hate him because
the lives he saves aren't
as good as the lives you save?

10:39.597 --> 10:41.515
Yeah, that's the reason.

10:41.641 --> 10:45.102
Nobel invented dynamite.
I won't accept
his blood money.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.107
The top of my head's
killing me.

10:52.861 --> 10:56.155
We spent a week
doing "top of head"
in anatomy.

10:56.281 --> 10:58.032
I know just where it is.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.621
- That is not the top of my head.
- Close enough for clinic.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.166
Your sinuses are clogged.

11:07.292 --> 11:11.045
Judging by the scratches
on your hands,
I'm guessing a new cat.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.505
It was my mother's.
She's dead.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.632
You keep a dead cat?

11:15.759 --> 11:18.510
No. My mother's dead.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.139
Poor cat. You're allergic.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.141
We can control it
with antihistamine.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.268
- One pill a day.
- Pills?

11:27.270 --> 11:30.147
You don't like to swallow.
Not surprised.

11:30.273 --> 11:33.067
Forget the pills.
We'll give you a nasal spray.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.651
Steroids?

11:34.778 --> 11:37.446
Is there something else
you can give me?

11:38.948 --> 11:41.700
Well, if you live
by the river, I've got a bag.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.287
Hey. Stress test was normal.

11:45.914 --> 11:49.541
- But his EKG was not normal.
- Echo's normal.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.836
Two for you, one for me.
We need a tiebreaker.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.255
Echo and stress tests are more reliable.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.757
Tilt table tests.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.592
That never works.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.136
I'll bet you
a week's clinic duty it does.

12:02.597 --> 12:03.722
You're on.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.769
You like this guy?

12:09.479 --> 12:12.940
You always
tell us our opinion
of the patient's irrelevant.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.610
Medically, it's irrelevant.
It says something about you.

12:16.736 --> 12:20.697
You figure anybody
who gives a crap about people
in Africa must be full of it?

12:20.824 --> 12:21.824
Yes.

12:22.617 --> 12:27.162
There's an evolutionary
imperative why we give a crap
about our family and friends.

12:27.288 --> 12:30.874
And there's an evolutionary
imperative why we don't give
a crap about anybody else.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.211
If we loved
all people indiscriminately,
we couldn't function.

12:34.337 --> 12:37.840
So the great humanitarian's
as selfish as the rest of us?

12:37.966 --> 12:40.134
Just not as honest about it.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.971
Well, you also always tell us
motives are irrelevant.

12:44.097 --> 12:48.100
Dr. Charles, your heart's
handling the changes
in orientation just fine.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.226
No pauses on your EKG.

12:49.352 --> 12:53.522
And House drives in for
the lay-up and no, rejected!

12:54.441 --> 12:57.526
- What does this knobby thing do?
- I'm within protocol range.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.153
You're not gonna
get a different result.

12:59.279 --> 13:03.574
The way I figure it is,
this could show you
problems at six,

13:03.700 --> 13:06.034
imagine what it'll tell you
if you crank it to 10.

13:06.161 --> 13:08.704
- House, is that you?
- Does it go to 11?

13:08.830 --> 13:12.166
Would you stop? You lost.
I'm scheduled for clinic duty
Thursday and Friday.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.042
All right, I'm beginning
to feel nauseous.

13:14.169 --> 13:16.420
Would you turn
the damn thing off
before you break it?

13:16.546 --> 13:18.464
Okay,
I'm getting dizzy.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.216
I can't see
and I'm gonna pass out.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.721
- I win.
- At those speeds, astronauts throw up.

13:25.847 --> 13:27.848
I'm not talking
about the nausea.

13:27.974 --> 13:31.143
- The test revealed the problem.
- Yeah? House is insane?

13:31.269 --> 13:33.854
- What he just did...
- Abusive and unprofessional.

13:33.980 --> 13:37.316
If he hadn't done it,
we wouldn't have
seen the problem.

13:37.442 --> 13:40.152
You've got
an abnormal PR interval.

13:40.278 --> 13:43.489
It could be dangerous,
possibly fatal, particularly
if you're in Africa

13:43.615 --> 13:45.157
away from advanced medicine.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.493
I'm gonna need a pacemaker?

13:47.619 --> 13:50.120
You're scheduled
for surgery this afternoon.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.921
We'll be able to maintain
your pacemaker from anywhere.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.173
You just need to get yourself
to a phone line
every few months.

14:01.299 --> 14:04.343
Better yet, you could join me
at one of my clinics.

14:04.469 --> 14:07.179
- I'm kind of spoiled.
- Well, we'll get you a hut with a view.

14:07.305 --> 14:09.973
- Do you like sand?
- I meant medically.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.935
- No PET scans, no MRIs...
- This is ridiculous.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.187
- Dr. Charles...
- I know. I know. Hospital regulations.

14:15.313 --> 14:17.731
Darling, have a seat.
Come on.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.400
You're smart. You'll adapt.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.819
- We're going up or down?
- Basement.

14:22.946 --> 14:24.154
All right.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.157
You might even find
that without
the technological crutches,

14:27.283 --> 14:28.742
you become
a better diagnostician.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.285
My heart
can handle this, right?

14:30.411 --> 14:33.497
So far, just carnival rides
have set you off.

14:34.457 --> 14:37.292
When you meet these people,
it changes you.

14:38.253 --> 14:40.295
We should
talk about it over dinner.

14:41.965 --> 14:44.550
Are you asking me
to Africa or on a date?

14:44.676 --> 14:49.179
I can ask you halfway around
the world, I can't ask you
to a restaurant a block away?

14:49.305 --> 14:53.058
- Well, one's a job, and the other's...
- Yeah, hospital regs.

14:53.184 --> 14:58.146
You can't date patients,
right? I wouldn't wanna risk
your precious objectivity.

14:58.273 --> 15:01.567
You haven't answered
either question, by the way.

15:01.693 --> 15:04.278
You don't think
objectivity's important?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.572
I think doctors like House
cling to objectivity

15:06.698 --> 15:09.908
like a three-year-old
to a blanket.
Don't get too worked up.

15:10.034 --> 15:13.954
Stay calm. Stay cool
and maintain
the correct perspective.

15:14.080 --> 15:18.000
The only flaw in their
argument is that when you
have millions of people dying,

15:18.126 --> 15:21.628
the correct perspective
is to be yelling
at the top of your lungs.

15:25.008 --> 15:28.302
- Sorry. My head is killing me.
- Here, sit on the step.

15:33.474 --> 15:36.560
So, are you gonna go out
with me or not?

15:36.686 --> 15:38.186
Your heart rate's normal.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.898
Yeah, of course it is.
It's one flight of stairs.
I'm gonna be fine.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.111
Hand's a little...

15:52.619 --> 15:55.537
Call a code,
second floor stairwell!

16:02.462 --> 16:05.881
- You were wrong.
- Hey, I have feelings.

16:06.007 --> 16:08.717
I'm trying my best.
Isn't that enough for you?

16:08.843 --> 16:12.137
- The abnormal EKG was real.
- It's not sick sinus syndrome.

16:12.263 --> 16:15.390
Thank God we found out
before we put
the pacemaker in.

16:15.516 --> 16:18.769
And thank God you dragged him
into a stairwell
to get his heart racing.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.229
We were taking the stairs.
They keep them
in the stairwell.

16:21.356 --> 16:23.273
The guy's a selfish jerk.
Why would you...

16:23.399 --> 16:24.733
Why would you say
he's selfish?

16:24.859 --> 16:26.068
Because he's been talking to Foreman.

16:26.194 --> 16:27.986
No, I haven't.
I'm just giving my opinion.

16:28.112 --> 16:30.364
This kind of altruism
doesn't just naturally...

16:30.490 --> 16:31.448
Excellent briefing.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.533
Hey, the guy's still sick.
Can we talk about that?

16:33.660 --> 16:36.662
Now, headaches point
to a neurological problem.
Acoustic neuroma.

16:36.788 --> 16:39.498
A brain tumor
causes dizziness,
loss of consciousness,

16:39.624 --> 16:41.583
messes with breathing
patterns, heart rhythms...

16:41.709 --> 16:42.793
Get an MRI.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.169
Hello?

16:45.254 --> 16:48.757
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll be right down.
No problem.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.967
I'll do an extra hour
to make up.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.429
I'm late for my clinic duty.

16:54.555 --> 16:57.099
Here, go be me
for a couple of hours.

17:01.396 --> 17:04.773
Explosive diarrhea, fever,
it's probably the flu.

17:04.899 --> 17:09.319
Wow. You're good.
You a Harvard boy?

17:09.445 --> 17:12.698
- You're not Hill, Oliver.
- No.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.741
Carter, Cecelia.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.576
They put you in the wrong room, Cecelia.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.371
- Mrs. Carter.
- Sorry.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.748
I'll just be
a few more minutes.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.792
Don't take these in order,
everything falls apart.

17:23.918 --> 17:25.252
I have cancer.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.088
I felt a lump.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.842
- I'll go get a nurse.
- Yeah, see you in an hour or two.

17:34.137 --> 17:35.512
Lie flat.

17:39.892 --> 17:43.061
Lift your left arm up
and under your head.

17:48.276 --> 17:49.901
- Right there?
- Yeah.

17:50.027 --> 17:52.070
I felt it this morning.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.906
Oh, my cousin
had the same thing.

17:55.908 --> 17:56.867
It's nothing.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.785
We should check it again
on your next cycle,

17:58.911 --> 18:01.496
but you really don't have
anything to worry about.

18:01.622 --> 18:02.998
That's what they told Donna.

18:03.124 --> 18:06.126
- She was dead in six months.
- Listen, the edges are smooth.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.712
It has mobility.
It has all the earmarks
of a benign...

18:08.838 --> 18:10.797
Why should I believe you?

18:10.923 --> 18:13.467
Because you're trying
to rush me out of here?

18:13.593 --> 18:16.470
The risks of a false positive
on a biopsy outweigh...

18:16.596 --> 18:20.015
Either you do the biopsy,
or I talk to your superior.

18:20.141 --> 18:23.393
Which is it, Dr. House?

18:26.355 --> 18:28.899
- I'll arrange the biopsy.
- Thanks.

18:38.242 --> 18:41.912
- He asked me out.
- I'm shocked.

18:43.915 --> 18:46.458
I'm shocked when patients
don't ask you out.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.797
He also asked me
to come to Africa.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.758
Boy, he moves fast.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.260
I think the two questions
had two different objectives.

18:57.386 --> 18:58.470
Do you like him?

18:58.596 --> 19:01.765
Good-looking single guy,
genius doctor,

19:01.891 --> 19:04.893
- cares about the world.
- I take it you said no.

19:05.019 --> 19:08.063
- You think I'm that hung up on rules?
- He's not House.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.315
There's nothing there.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.407
Yeah, there is.

19:21.035 --> 19:22.994
Did I ask you to plant a PPD?

19:23.120 --> 19:25.205
It was positive. He's got TB!

19:25.331 --> 19:29.376
Well, of course he's got TB.
The guy's been
in the jungle for 20 years.

19:30.962 --> 19:34.297
If he tested positive
for pinkeye, would you think
that was his big problem?

19:34.423 --> 19:36.800
I did a test. It was positive.
Why is that a problem?

19:36.926 --> 19:39.511
Because now he's got
the big red target on his arm,

19:39.637 --> 19:42.305
the stubborn jerk thinks
he's right. He won't let us
do any more tests.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.766
Well, maybe he's not
the only stubborn jerk.

19:44.892 --> 19:48.186
I did an LP, too.
Low glucose, and he has
an increased sed rate.

19:48.312 --> 19:51.481
- Everything screams tuberculosis!
- Not everything!

19:51.607 --> 19:55.902
If any of the symptoms
are caused by the TB, it would
throw off our diagnosis.

20:00.283 --> 20:03.869
You're right.
We gotta treat the TB.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.789
Who knows?
Maybe he'll just get better.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.916
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

20:18.509 --> 20:21.761
So, it's TB, but not TB?

20:21.888 --> 20:25.765
- I'm complicated.
- The guy does know tuberculosis.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.268
- If he says it can manifest...
- The guy's not even a real doctor.

20:28.394 --> 20:31.271
- He's a human telethon.
- Is that your problem with him?

20:31.397 --> 20:33.773
You see hypocrites every day.
Why is this guy so special?

20:33.900 --> 20:36.484
You think I have
a hypocritical attitude
to hypocrisy?

20:36.611 --> 20:40.155
The problem is, there are 26
letters in the alphabet
and he only uses two of them.

20:40.281 --> 20:42.407
He treats
thousands of patients
with one diagnosis.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.492
He knows the answer
going in. It's cheating.

20:44.619 --> 20:48.455
So it's all because
he's one of them
useless specialists?

20:49.582 --> 20:53.293
Oh, did I hurt
the big-time oncologist's
itty-bitty feelings?

20:53.419 --> 20:56.087
You're a big help
to patients who actually
have cancer.

20:56.213 --> 20:59.758
- Other times you're just annoying.
- You've outdone yourself.

20:59.884 --> 21:02.928
I'll say. My salad's covering
a free T-bone steak.

21:03.054 --> 21:05.180
Cecelia Carter, remember her?

21:05.306 --> 21:07.766
Last week they said it was
mystery stew. They owe me.

21:07.892 --> 21:11.311
She was just in my office
crying because of the way
you treated her.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.771
That doesn't sound like you.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.689
Then it probably wasn't.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.734
I get that you like
to shock people,

21:17.860 --> 21:21.112
stun them out of complacency,
out of stupidity.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.198
But this woman thought
she had cancer.

21:23.324 --> 21:26.660
She had a lump in her breast.
What were you trying
to accomplish?

21:26.786 --> 21:30.205
Let me ask you something.
If this were another doctor,

21:30.331 --> 21:33.833
if the patient were
complaining about, let's say,
I don't know, Foreman,

21:33.960 --> 21:37.796
you'd just dismiss this
as the paranoid bitching
of another paranoid bitch.

21:37.922 --> 21:40.298
- And file it under "P" for...
- Paranoid?

21:40.424 --> 21:41.716
Am not.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.803
- You're right.
- Good.

21:44.929 --> 21:48.014
Apologize to her
before the end
of business today.

21:50.184 --> 21:52.936
- What did you do to Ceci?
- I have no idea.

21:53.604 --> 21:56.106
Just the salad today.
Big breakfast.

21:56.232 --> 21:57.399
Hey.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.737
Levofloxacin?

22:03.781 --> 22:05.907
You have
a resistant strain of TB.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.702
Wow, you just
walk right in with these.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.578
That's what we doctors do.

22:10.705 --> 22:13.999
We write down the name
of some medicine,
and someone gives it to us.

22:14.125 --> 22:19.004
You know, there's parts of
the world where you get knifed
walking around with this.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.881
I mean, the regular stuff
is bad enough,

22:22.008 --> 22:24.634
but the treatment
for the resistant strain?

22:27.680 --> 22:30.098
They get $6 a tablet for that.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.934
And I take it for two years.

22:33.060 --> 22:36.062
Streptomycin.
Now, that's two grand.

22:38.566 --> 22:40.442
Ten grand, cure one person.

22:47.491 --> 22:50.910
I had a patient in Djani once.

22:51.912 --> 22:56.791
It was a mother,
had three little boys.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.918
She had resistant TB.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.797
She couldn't afford these.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.924
She couldn't afford bread.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.928
We gave her
the regular stuff, but

23:11.182 --> 23:14.225
- no surprise, she died.
- Sorry.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.529
I'm not taking these pills.

23:28.074 --> 23:31.618
Because she couldn't get them,
you're not gonna take them?

23:31.744 --> 23:33.036
- That's insane.
- Why?

23:33.162 --> 23:35.789
- 'Cause I'm better than her?
- Because letting her die was wrong,

23:35.915 --> 23:38.500
but letting you die
is just as wrong.

23:39.543 --> 23:40.919
Maybe I won't die.

23:41.796 --> 23:44.923
Maybe somebody will pay
a little more attention
to my story.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.806
He figures
the pharmaceutical companies

23:52.932 --> 23:54.599
need something big
to force them into action.

23:54.725 --> 23:57.852
This'll get a lot more
media play than 1,000
African villagers dying.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.646
So, he won't take the pills.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.482
- Newsweek's calling you.
- And he won't agree to any more tests.

24:02.608 --> 24:03.691
He has his diagnosis.

24:03.818 --> 24:05.026
See what happens
when you don't listen to me?

24:05.152 --> 24:06.945
Maybe millions
of lives get saved.

24:07.071 --> 24:09.030
Yeah. That's my point.

24:09.532 --> 24:11.825
Increased heart rate,
night sweats,

24:11.951 --> 24:15.787
loss of consciousness.
Besides rough sex, what do
they all have in common?

24:15.913 --> 24:17.413
- T...
- It's not TB!

24:17.540 --> 24:19.082
His autonomic nervous system?

24:19.208 --> 24:22.502
- We know that it's not a brain tumor.
- What else could be eating his nerves?

24:22.628 --> 24:24.796
Fabry's. Autonomic
dysregulation syndrome.

24:24.922 --> 24:28.591
Shy-Drager syndrome.
It doesn't matter.
He won't let us test him.

24:33.722 --> 24:37.600
In my opinion,
Dr. Sebastian Charles
is an idiot.

24:37.726 --> 24:41.688
Yeah, you can quote me.
C-U-D-D-Y.

24:44.316 --> 24:47.402
Sebastian is refusing
life-saving treatment.

24:47.528 --> 24:51.322
He's refusing TB treatment.
You don't think he has TB.

24:51.448 --> 24:54.450
- Ergo, you should care less.
- He won't let me test him.

24:54.577 --> 24:55.952
And what do you want me to do about it?

24:56.078 --> 24:57.579
Hold him down.

24:57.705 --> 25:00.498
Have you apologized
to Cecelia Carter yet?

25:01.208 --> 25:03.168
Trust me, she doesn't
wanna hear from me.

25:03.294 --> 25:04.669
Look, the guy
is killing himself!

25:04.795 --> 25:07.172
Am I the only one who realizes
this is a bad thing?

25:07.298 --> 25:11.509
If he was a Christian
Scientist refusing meds,
we'd have 18 attorneys...

25:13.846 --> 25:15.680
You're putting on makeup.

25:16.307 --> 25:18.558
That's not a good sign
for my side, is it?

25:18.684 --> 25:22.145
Sebastian has called
a press conference for 3:00.

25:22.271 --> 25:25.690
He's asked me to be there
to confirm the diagnosis
and the prognosis.

25:25.816 --> 25:28.318
You are as big
a media whore as he is.

25:28.444 --> 25:32.280
Of course I am.
It couldn't possibly
be that I think he's right,

25:32.406 --> 25:34.699
and that I'd like to be
a small part
of what he's doing.

25:34.825 --> 25:38.786
Oh, whores can like the sex.
Doesn't mean
they're not whores.

25:38.913 --> 25:43.208
And with that eye shadow,
I am totally screwed,
aren't I?

25:43.334 --> 25:44.417
Totally.

25:48.589 --> 25:51.132
How you feeling?
A little weak.

25:51.258 --> 25:53.009
You're having a good day.

25:54.261 --> 25:57.305
The symptoms
will quickly focus more
and more on your lungs.

25:57.431 --> 25:59.474
You'll find it
difficult to talk
and eventually breathe at all.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.476
I think I know what I'll have
to look forward to.

26:01.602 --> 26:02.602
I know.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.980
I just came to ask
if you'd be willing
to accept any treatment.

26:06.106 --> 26:07.815
No, if you're trying to scare me into...

26:07.942 --> 26:10.777
No. Palliative treatment.

26:11.487 --> 26:12.695
Narcotics.

26:12.821 --> 26:15.823
Fentanyl patch, morphine drip,
whatever it takes.

26:15.950 --> 26:18.952
We can make your last days
fairly comfortable.

26:19.954 --> 26:23.498
And if you have
another good day,
maybe dinner.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.419
Thank you.

26:38.472 --> 26:42.767
You want
Third World treatment?
You got it.

26:42.893 --> 26:45.770
- Boy, is it hot here in Djani.
- What are you doing?

26:45.896 --> 26:47.105
What am I doing?

26:47.231 --> 26:49.857
Putting everything
on the floor of the hut.

26:50.901 --> 26:53.069
What's the magic box
with the moving pictures?

26:53.195 --> 26:55.321
- You think he's a hypocrite?
- Hypocrite? No.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.533
Everybody in Africa's
got cell phones
and running water.

27:01.620 --> 27:04.122
This thing just
will not flush.

27:04.248 --> 27:07.333
Do you really think
that if you come in here
and make it a little hot,

27:07.459 --> 27:08.543
make it smell a little,

27:08.669 --> 27:12.463
that I'm just gonna fold
and abandon everything
that matters to me?

27:13.674 --> 27:16.217
Lousy sanitation
over there, too.

27:16.343 --> 27:19.178
You are not the same as them.
Your life is not the same.

27:19.305 --> 27:22.015
And you're cheapening
everything they're going
through by pretending you are.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.433
I am the same.
I'm not special.

27:23.559 --> 27:27.020
You can't demand
to be treated like any
Third World sick person

27:27.146 --> 27:30.315
- and call a press conference!
- They treat me special!

27:30.441 --> 27:32.317
That doesn't mean I am.

27:33.319 --> 27:37.071
And what kind of selfish jerk
wouldn't take advantage
of that fact?

27:52.171 --> 27:54.130
It's all preventable.

27:54.256 --> 27:57.467
Stoia Tucker makes medications
right here in New Jersey.

27:57.593 --> 28:01.262
They have warehouses full of
the stuff. There's more than
enough to go around.

28:01.388 --> 28:04.474
So if I can get them,
why can't Lemma?

28:05.309 --> 28:08.770
Why can't Quesmo?
And why can't Sarni?

28:12.024 --> 28:16.194
Another person just died.
Where is your outrage?

28:16.320 --> 28:19.072
No,
I have no intention
of martyring myself.

28:19.198 --> 28:20.198
I'm just putting myself...

28:20.324 --> 28:23.159
Sure, they're dying,
but it's got a great beat.

28:23.786 --> 28:25.578
Must be hot as hell under those lights.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.247
- Yep.
- Hey, why the page?

28:28.374 --> 28:31.334
- He okay?
- He's in a coma.

28:32.127 --> 28:35.254
I need you to
apologize to Ceci, Cecily.

28:35.381 --> 28:39.217
- Mrs. Carter? For what?
- For whatever I did.

28:39.343 --> 28:42.303
- You didn't do anything.
- That has been my position all along.

28:42.429 --> 28:45.431
His chestx-rays
are negative, so he's not
contagious at this point.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.183
His condition
is currently stable.

28:47.309 --> 28:51.187
Do you ever notice how all
the self-sacrificing
women in history,

28:51.313 --> 28:53.731
Joan of Arc, Mother Teresa,

28:54.566 --> 28:57.276
can't think of any others,
they all die alone.

28:57.403 --> 29:01.489
The men, on the other hand,
get so much fuzz it's crazy.

29:01.615 --> 29:03.199
It's an unfair world.

29:03.325 --> 29:05.660
House, she was scared and unreasonable.

29:05.786 --> 29:07.995
Insulting a woman
with breast cancer,

29:08.122 --> 29:12.917
that's a move best left
to the pros. Frankly,
you don't have the chops.

29:13.043 --> 29:17.463
I didn't insult her!
I did the unnecessary
biopsy like she wanted.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.465
It was negative
like I knew it would be.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.634
What'd you do,
call them perky?

29:21.760 --> 29:25.221
You are years away
from mad skills like that.

29:25.347 --> 29:27.348
I need you to apologize.

29:28.267 --> 29:31.144
Cuddy's only doing this
because she thinks it's you.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.146
Welcome to the world.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.606
Everyone's different,
everyone gets
treated different.

29:35.732 --> 29:38.651
And you try fighting that,
you wind up dying of TB.

29:40.779 --> 29:41.946
What are you doing?

29:42.072 --> 29:44.699
Testing the patient's
autonomic nervous system.

29:45.826 --> 29:46.826
Of course.

29:46.952 --> 29:49.495
His internal heating
and ventilation should be off.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.122
He shouldn't be able to sweat.

29:51.248 --> 29:53.207
That's why he's got
that awful body powder.

29:53.333 --> 29:57.128
Take it away,
crank up the heat,
stick him under the lights,

29:57.254 --> 30:00.465
he can't cool himself.
He should be turning
bright red.

30:00.591 --> 30:02.175
The picture's fine.

30:04.803 --> 30:05.887
Yeah.

30:11.018 --> 30:12.477
I'm asking Stoia Tucker

30:12.603 --> 30:15.146
to save these lives,
millions of lives,

30:15.272 --> 30:17.440
including my own.

30:17.566 --> 30:20.234
Dr. House,
I would appreciate it
if you left us...

30:20.360 --> 30:21.777
Get that out of my face.

30:21.904 --> 30:23.571
What are you
trying to prove, House?

30:23.697 --> 30:26.199
Dr. House,
I would appreciate it
if you left the room while...

30:26.325 --> 30:27.700
He's sweating like a pig.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.119
It's 100 degrees in here,
House, because you
turned up the thermostat.

30:30.245 --> 30:33.122
Did they hear me?
The media, did they listen?

30:33.248 --> 30:35.750
- He's disoriented.
- They have to hear me.

30:35.876 --> 30:38.878
- His arteries are clamping down.
- I want everybody out of here now!

30:39.004 --> 30:40.671
Get the crash cart.
He's having a cardiac arrest.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.340
- Get it set up.
- All right.

30:42.466 --> 30:43.674
Get them out!

30:44.593 --> 30:47.136
Everyone. I want
everyone out of here now!

30:51.350 --> 30:52.475
Clear.

30:56.897 --> 30:58.773
Come on, Sebastian.

30:58.899 --> 30:59.982
Clear.

31:01.068 --> 31:02.610
I've got sinus rhythm.

31:13.163 --> 31:17.333
That is not TB.
- Compelling television.

31:20.546 --> 31:24.590
- Do whatever tests you want.
- I want to treat you for TB.

31:25.676 --> 31:29.595
Dr. Cameron found low sugar
in your cerebrospinal fluid.

31:29.721 --> 31:33.975
- It's a classic finding of TB.
- Oh, now you think TB's the problem?

31:34.101 --> 31:35.476
No.

31:35.602 --> 31:38.145
If TB caused
cardiac arrest on a hot day,

31:38.272 --> 31:41.148
your work in Africa would be
even more futile
than it already is.

31:41.275 --> 31:42.984
Can you get
to your point, please?

31:43.110 --> 31:46.612
That whiteboard in my office,
we're up to about
a dozen symptoms now.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.532
Cardiac arrest,
clearly not TB.

31:49.658 --> 31:51.951
CSF sugar clearly is TB.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.203
The rest of them
could go either way.

31:54.329 --> 31:57.582
Unless we know
which ones are which,
I can't diagnose you.

32:01.587 --> 32:05.256
I'll take any other tests
or treatments
you might want to prescribe.

32:08.802 --> 32:11.345
So you're not special,
but TB is.

32:11.471 --> 32:14.640
People die of TB
because we let them.
It's our choice.

32:14.766 --> 32:17.893
People die of malaria
because we let them.
They die of dysentery. They...

32:18.020 --> 32:21.731
- No, TB's my disease.
- You own a disease?

32:22.399 --> 32:25.526
Well, I'm sorry I missed
the IPO on dengue fever.

32:25.652 --> 32:29.697
Look, I know I have a way
about me, and I know I piss
a lot of people off.

32:29.823 --> 32:31.949
And a whole lot more
I just annoy.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.076
But you're the first person
that I've ever met

32:34.202 --> 32:36.912
who I think is actually
annoyed by what I do.

32:37.039 --> 32:40.791
Do you think
I'm not saving any lives,
or is that a bad thing?

32:40.917 --> 32:43.502
Right now, I'm just trying
to save your life.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.838
Or do you just have
a problem with hope?

32:48.383 --> 32:52.386
You know, the difference
between our jobs
is not numbers or styles.

32:52.512 --> 32:56.182
It's that I know
I'm gonna fail. Even if
I save a million people,

32:56.308 --> 33:00.519
there's gonna be
another million.
You couldn't handle that.

33:01.605 --> 33:04.065
I think you resent
anyone who can.

33:04.191 --> 33:07.401
Can't we just agree
that you're
incredibly annoying?

33:07.527 --> 33:09.695
Take the pills,
or I'll let you die,

33:09.821 --> 33:12.490
do an autopsy,
call my own press conference

33:12.616 --> 33:15.534
and make sure the world knows
that you didn't die of TB.

33:15.661 --> 33:19.080
Corporate sponsors will be
disappointed, but they'll find
another disease.

33:19.206 --> 33:20.956
Why would you do that?

33:21.083 --> 33:23.542
Because I'm just a mean
son of a bitch.

34:32.821 --> 34:37.950
So, we still have to explain
PR variability, syncope,
headaches

34:38.076 --> 34:39.452
and

34:40.746 --> 34:41.704
low sugar?

34:41.830 --> 34:44.707
- That was classic TB.
- Apparently not.

34:44.833 --> 34:47.001
- You rerun the test?
- Yeah.

34:47.836 --> 34:50.796
- This is good.
- Good? This is bizarre.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.840
"Bizarre" is good.

34:52.966 --> 34:56.218
"Common" has
hundreds of explanations.
"Bizarre" has hardly any.

34:56.344 --> 34:59.305
What else could cause
low CSF sugar?

34:59.431 --> 35:00.848
I get to ask the questions.

35:00.974 --> 35:04.685
I've found you look a lot
smarter asking questions than
dumbly not answering them.

35:04.811 --> 35:07.688
- High insulin levels in his blood.
- They'd have to be very high.

35:07.814 --> 35:10.357
Okay, very high
insulin levels in his blood.

35:10.484 --> 35:12.234
How could he get
high insulin levels?

35:12.360 --> 35:15.070
We've checked
daily blood sugars,
all normal.

35:15.197 --> 35:17.865
See how smart she looks?
'Cause she asked the question.

35:17.991 --> 35:20.993
And it's not glucagonoma
because he has no rash.

35:21.119 --> 35:24.246
It's not self-induced
because he's not an idiot.

35:24.372 --> 35:28.584
And it's not a tumor
because the CT and the MRI
were both negative.

35:28.710 --> 35:30.419
Which just leaves tumor.

35:34.883 --> 35:37.593
Why do you do this?
Why do you ignore what I say
like I'm not even...

35:37.719 --> 35:39.970
Small tumor.
Really, really tiny.

35:40.096 --> 35:41.639
So small we can't see it.

35:41.765 --> 35:43.432
Nesidioblastoma.

35:43.558 --> 35:46.727
An abnormal growth of
the insulin-secreting cells
in his pancreas?

35:46.853 --> 35:48.312
That only intermittently
secrets insulin...

35:48.438 --> 35:49.772
In response to stress,

35:49.898 --> 35:54.693
like if, I don't know,
if someone accidentally puts
the mechanical bull on 11.

35:54.820 --> 35:57.112
Easily removed by surgery.

35:57.239 --> 36:00.658
Except if it's so small
we can't see it,

36:00.784 --> 36:02.201
how are we even gonna
prove it's there?

36:02.327 --> 36:03.786
She asked, looking clever.

36:03.912 --> 36:07.790
Just start hacking away
at his pancreas
until he gets better?

36:07.916 --> 36:10.084
How do you prove
something exists
when you can't see it?

36:10.210 --> 36:12.962
Does God exist?
Does the wind blow?

36:13.088 --> 36:16.131
- We know because the leaves move.
- Look for effects.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.843
You should look
the other way.

36:18.969 --> 36:20.970
- There's Cuddy with your patient.
- Dr. House!

36:21.096 --> 36:23.055
Dr. House has an emergency.

36:23.849 --> 36:27.059
- We can't avoid her forever.
- Eventually she'll die.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.936
You sure she doesn't
have breast cancer?

36:29.855 --> 36:31.689
We think
you have a tumor.

36:31.815 --> 36:35.442
Easily removed surgically.
We're gonna poke it
with a stick.

36:35.569 --> 36:38.779
- And if there's no tumor?
- Nothing happens.

36:39.990 --> 36:42.908
Splenic artery,
it's a hard left
off the celiac.

36:44.578 --> 36:45.953
If there is a tumor?

36:46.580 --> 36:49.123
What usually happens
when you poke something
with a stick?

36:49.249 --> 36:50.624
Pokes back.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.835
He's stuck in the
superior mesenteric.

36:53.795 --> 36:56.797
I knew we should have
stopped for directions. Men!

36:57.799 --> 36:58.841
I'm there.

36:59.801 --> 37:02.386
We're gonna inject calcium
into your pancreas.

37:03.096 --> 37:05.055
The beta cells
will release insulin.

37:05.181 --> 37:07.725
If there are
too many beta cells
because of a tumor,

37:07.851 --> 37:10.853
your blood sugar
will drop precipitously.

37:10.979 --> 37:13.147
How do we know
it won't go too low?

37:13.273 --> 37:15.733
Fingers and toes crossed.

37:17.319 --> 37:18.652
Go ahead.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.793
Glucose is holding
steady at 75.

37:35.712 --> 37:40.633
- No leaves rustling. Blow harder.
- I already gave him one amp.

37:40.759 --> 37:44.261
Well, I guess now would be
the time to give him
more than one amp.

37:56.232 --> 37:59.652
Fifty.
It's starting to drop.

38:02.697 --> 38:06.367
- Forty-five.
- I think my arm's shaking.

38:06.534 --> 38:08.661
I'm gonna start him
on a glucose drip.
He's gonna seize.

38:08.787 --> 38:09.912
Not yet.

38:11.665 --> 38:14.875
- It's continuing to drop.
- Not fast enough.

38:22.676 --> 38:25.177
- He's seizing.
- We've got to reverse this.

38:26.972 --> 38:31.433
He's at 40, 38, 35.

38:39.359 --> 38:42.695
Push an amp of D50.
You want to kill the guy?

38:52.163 --> 38:53.956
We're back to 40.

38:55.291 --> 38:58.669
Congratulations.
You have a tumor.

39:03.425 --> 39:05.300
Are you gonna go out with him?

39:06.386 --> 39:10.139
- Is that any of your business?
- Nope.

39:11.725 --> 39:12.808
I don't think so.

39:12.934 --> 39:16.103
Two days ago,
you were holding his hand.
What's changed?

39:17.731 --> 39:20.607
He practically
lives in Africa.
There's no future.

39:21.401 --> 39:24.653
On the other hand,
maybe there's too much
of a future now.

39:24.779 --> 39:28.657
You weren't attracted to him
because he was prepared
to die for a cause.

39:28.783 --> 39:31.744
You were attracted to him
because he was
actually doing it.

39:31.870 --> 39:34.913
- Right. It's that simple.
- That was simple?

39:35.040 --> 39:37.875
I put a label on him and go from there.

39:38.001 --> 39:39.626
Everybody does it.

39:39.753 --> 39:41.837
We are
who people think we are.

39:41.963 --> 39:44.214
People think
he's a great doctor,
so they give him stuff.

39:44.340 --> 39:47.217
- He is a great doctor.
- The reality is irrelevant.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.016
I'll prove it.

39:54.684 --> 39:58.645
People who know me
see me as an ass,
treat me as an ass.

39:58.772 --> 40:02.357
People who don't know me
see a cripple,
treat me like a cripple.

40:03.777 --> 40:07.154
What sort of selfish jerk
wouldn't take advantage
of that fact?

40:17.957 --> 40:21.418
Oh, my goodness. Are you okay?

40:23.171 --> 40:26.632
Yeah.
I am so sorry.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.634
It was completely my fault.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.552
It's nothing. I'm fine.

40:30.678 --> 40:33.514
Well, I'm very relieved.
I feel terrible.

40:33.640 --> 40:37.059
- Please don't worry about it. I'm fine.
- You sure?

40:37.185 --> 40:38.393
Okay.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.657
How's everything?

40:51.783 --> 40:54.409
I'm gonna go.
My foot's killing me.

40:54.536 --> 40:58.038
- What did you do to...
- It was nothing. It was all my fault.

41:01.626 --> 41:03.794
Yeah, listen.
Bogale, relax, okay?

41:03.920 --> 41:06.463
I'm gonna be back on Tuesday.

41:06.589 --> 41:09.800
Tell Sarni I'm gonna bring her
a new brace. All right.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.929
- Just in case.
- You get them?

41:14.055 --> 41:16.640
Six-months' supply.
Should fix you right up.

41:16.766 --> 41:18.433
I'll see you when you
come back for a refill?

41:18.560 --> 41:20.144
Yeah, I'll see you
in two months.

41:20.270 --> 41:22.396
You gonna give them away?

41:22.522 --> 41:25.816
Well, you know how these
things happen. You leave
a bag on the airplane,

41:25.942 --> 41:28.318
you drop some pills
down the drain.

41:29.279 --> 41:32.948
I have an idea.
You could bring me
the refill in Africa.

41:33.783 --> 41:35.159
I don't think so.

41:35.785 --> 41:39.204
You actually like
working for House?
You find this satisfying?

42:11.779 --> 42:12.738
There he is.

42:12.864 --> 42:14.656
- It's good to see you. Dr. Sebastian.
- Thank you.

42:14.782 --> 42:18.035
Thank you. I appreciate that.
I appreciate the support.

42:18.161 --> 42:20.829
It's not about the kids
dying every eight seconds.

42:20.955 --> 42:25.709
It's about the media stroking,
adulation, the pats
on the head.

42:26.794 --> 42:29.004
That's your problem
with him, isn't it?

42:29.130 --> 42:31.924
Look at him.
Loves it, eats it up.

42:32.050 --> 42:35.802
Yeah, the man actually
enjoys what he does.

42:41.809 --> 42:44.102
Listen, I saved his life.

42:44.229 --> 42:47.773
That means I get credit
for every life he saves
from here on out.

42:48.441 --> 42:50.442
I'll make sure
Stockholm knows.
