Dre, now,
will you get out of my car?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.210
The Lakers game just ended,
and I got to hunt for strays.

08:41.210 --> 08:43.290
Fine.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.880
But you know what?

08:44.880 --> 08:46.420
If you're getting
the duplex,

08:46.420 --> 08:48.670
I'm taking these mints.
Bye.

08:48.670 --> 08:50.920
And this car charger.
Okay.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.670
And your garage-door opener.
No, I need that!

08:52.670 --> 08:54.210
Dre!
I need that!

08:54.210 --> 08:55.960
You know what? Okay.
Mm-hmm.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.790
All right.
Hey, hey!

08:57.790 --> 09:00.290
Your garage door's open now!

09:05.120 --> 09:06.330
Hey, Ma--

09:08.380 --> 09:10.330
Mama?

09:10.330 --> 09:12.790
Mama, no!
Why, Black Jesus?!

09:12.790 --> 09:14.250
Take me instead!

09:14.250 --> 09:16.040
Oh, stop acting a fool!
I just fell asleep.

09:16.040 --> 09:17.040
What's wrong with you?

09:17.040 --> 09:18.120
Oh.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.580
How about fifty shades
of a plot?

09:22.880 --> 09:25.880
Rhonda filled me in about what's
going on with the inheritance.

09:25.880 --> 09:27.960
Oh!
And I just want to
let you know

09:27.960 --> 09:29.830
that I'm totally cool.

09:29.830 --> 09:32.830
Totally, totally cool.

09:32.830 --> 09:35.080
Well, I'm glad, baby.

09:38.580 --> 09:41.250
You know, one might think
that you would, uh,

09:41.250 --> 09:44.040
divide your assets among
your children equally,

09:44.040 --> 09:48.170
but you made a strong move,
and I get that.

09:49.580 --> 09:50.920
Thank you, baby.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.580
Damn it, Mama!
I'm your special boy!

09:56.580 --> 09:57.830
What happened?!

09:57.830 --> 10:03.500
Ooh, this is an ugly color
on you, Andre.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.540
I never thought
you were this petty.

10:05.540 --> 10:07.460
If I was being petty,
I would remind you

10:07.460 --> 10:09.120
of how many grandchildren
I've given you,

10:09.120 --> 10:10.210
but I'm bigger than that.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.210
Five.

10:12.210 --> 10:14.120
Ma, it just
doesn't seem fair.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.620
I didn't ask
for your opinion.

10:15.620 --> 10:17.420
Now,
if you don't like it,

10:17.420 --> 10:19.000
you go work it out
with your sister.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.120
My mother was no help.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.880
Meanwhile, Junior was so busy
helping his aunt,

10:26.880 --> 10:28.500
he was no help to Bow.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.210
Hello, sweetheart.

10:30.210 --> 10:32.420
What's that?
Mother.

10:32.420 --> 10:34.830
Wow!
That looks --

10:34.830 --> 10:36.920
That looks unfinished.
Mm-hmm.

10:36.920 --> 10:38.540
You see this?
Yeah.

10:38.540 --> 10:41.290
This is where the stuff would
go...if I had a glue stick.

10:41.290 --> 10:43.830
Oh, my God. Yes.
A glue stick.

10:43.830 --> 10:46.000
Okay, I'm gonna go
get you a glue stick.
Thanks.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.250
Can you watch the kids
while I --

10:47.250 --> 10:48.580
I ca--

10:48.580 --> 10:50.460
Okay, hang on. Oh, my God.
Wait. Hold on.

10:50.460 --> 10:52.500
What?
Why is he awake?

10:52.500 --> 10:53.710
He has nowhere to be?

10:53.710 --> 10:55.500
Okay, Junior,

10:55.500 --> 10:57.290
can you go get her
a glue stick?

10:57.290 --> 10:59.330
That's a no can do.
What?

10:59.330 --> 11:02.080
Got to drive Auntie-maria
to the Creed meet and greet.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.290
I'm pretty sure she can
get there by herself.

11:04.290 --> 11:06.120
She's had six Proseccos.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.620
What?

11:07.620 --> 11:09.330
Blessed be the fruit
of the vine.

11:09.330 --> 11:10.710
All righty, let's go.

11:10.710 --> 11:12.120
Yeah, put that down.

11:12.120 --> 11:13.920
Oh, my God.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.330
Hey, wh-- why
are you in your pajamas?

11:16.330 --> 11:18.580
Did you take a nap
after school?

11:18.580 --> 11:21.620
A nap? I'm just waking up
from last night.

11:21.620 --> 11:22.790
What?

11:22.790 --> 11:24.540
Junior has been getting us
up in the morning.

11:24.540 --> 11:26.710
He has?
Can I have some cereal?

11:26.710 --> 11:28.500
I only have an hour
to eat breakfast and lunch

11:28.500 --> 11:29.500
before dinner.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.250
Of course, sweetheart.
I'm sorry.

11:31.250 --> 11:32.250
My goodness.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.790
O-- Oh.

11:33.790 --> 11:36.080
Right.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.750
Junior buys the cereal.

11:39.290 --> 11:42.250
Guys, the Environmental
Impact Agency

11:42.250 --> 11:44.750
says this entire building
is riddled with asbestos

11:44.750 --> 11:46.830
and black mold,
so gather up our stuff.

11:46.830 --> 11:48.460
We got to vacate immediately.

11:48.460 --> 11:50.790
I need to get my inheritance
back from my sister.

11:50.790 --> 11:53.920
Outstanding. Nobody leaves this
table till we figure it out.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.790
Come on.
But the asbestos.

11:55.790 --> 11:58.420
First things first -- how bad
do you want to crush her?

11:58.420 --> 12:00.960
Like, are we talking
"no relationship for
10 years" crushed

12:00.960 --> 12:03.960
or, like, "yelling at cars for
the rest of her life" crushed?

12:03.960 --> 12:05.170
I don't want to crush her.

12:05.170 --> 12:07.080
Okay, that's
the wrong attitude, Dre.

12:07.080 --> 12:08.830
Hey, everyone else is leaving,
so maybe --

12:08.830 --> 12:12.000
You want to lawyer up, just like
I did when I sued Panera.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.080
Actually,
I hired two lawyers.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.830
Got the second one
to look after the first one

12:15.830 --> 12:18.170
to make sure he wasn't in
the pocket of Big Bread.

12:18.170 --> 12:19.540
Okay, I'm not gonna get
a lawyer, all right?

12:19.540 --> 12:21.960
I just need to convince Rhonda
to give me half.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.920
Okay, good luck.
You couldn't convince me

12:23.920 --> 12:26.120

So Bread's got their hooks
in you, too.

this conversation outside?

like burning film.

You do not want to be
the only one without a lawyer.

Just be smart and lawyer up,
okay?

Otherwise you're gonna
find yourself answering
a lot of questions

your mom dying,

she'll die?
