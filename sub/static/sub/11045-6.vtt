WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:04.405
* [chamber music] *

00:08.809 --> 00:12.646
First lesson of the day. We
very carefully set the table

00:12.680 --> 00:15.116
without using magic
so that-- YIPES!

00:19.753 --> 00:22.290
Did you-- how-- when-- what?

00:22.323 --> 00:23.757
What?

00:23.791 --> 00:26.727
I said no magic. You were
supposed to do it by hoof

00:26.760 --> 00:29.197
so I could work in
a friendship lesson.

00:29.230 --> 00:33.167
Oh. I heard set the table
and just kinda went for it.

00:33.201 --> 00:35.369
Well, if you
hadn't used magic,

00:35.403 --> 00:38.106
you'd have heard
me say, uh,

00:38.139 --> 00:41.642
this plate represents your
head, this spoon is your heart

00:41.675 --> 00:46.480
and the knives... are sharp.
Always be careful with knives.

00:46.514 --> 00:48.116
[sigh]

00:48.149 --> 00:49.617
The metaphors make more
sense when you're actually

00:49.650 --> 00:51.685
setting the table.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.821
Should I change it back?

00:53.854 --> 00:56.357
I just want to make sure
you're ready for this dinner.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.326
Princess Celestia will be
joining us tomorrow night

00:58.359 --> 01:01.162
to see how the friendship
lessons are going.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.464
If it's just you, me
and Princess Celestia,

01:03.497 --> 01:05.566
why are there
four seats?

01:05.599 --> 01:08.436
Well, the whole point is for
you to bring a new friend.

01:08.469 --> 01:10.171
That way the Princess
will see for herself

01:10.204 --> 01:11.705
just how far
you've come.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.608
And how good a
teacher you have.

01:14.642 --> 01:16.810
I can't choose. I
like all your friends.

01:16.844 --> 01:19.747
That's the best part. You
have to make a new friend.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.384
New friends?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.853
Hey, maybe I'll just
force friendships

01:25.886 --> 01:28.422
by magically enslaving
the entire population

01:28.456 --> 01:30.291
of Ponyville!

01:30.324 --> 01:32.160
Starlight!

01:32.193 --> 01:33.794
Kidding! Heh heh heh.

01:37.265 --> 01:40.601
* My little pony,
my little pony *

01:40.634 --> 01:42.570
* Aaaahhh

01:42.603 --> 01:44.572
* My little Pony

01:44.605 --> 01:47.175
* I used to wonder what
friendship could be. *

01:47.208 --> 01:48.842
* My Little Pony

01:48.876 --> 01:51.512
* Until you all shared
its magic with me. *

01:51.545 --> 01:53.547
* Big adventure!
* Tons of fun

01:53.581 --> 01:55.716
* A beautiful heart! *
Faithful and strong! *

01:55.749 --> 01:57.818
* Sharing kindness
* it's an easy feat

01:57.851 --> 01:59.853
* And magic makes it
all complete! *

01:59.887 --> 02:02.190
* To have my little pony

02:02.223 --> 02:05.493
* Do you know you're all
my very best friends? *

02:05.526 --> 02:09.563
**

02:13.734 --> 02:16.704
Let's see. Make new
friends in Ponyville,

02:16.737 --> 02:19.173
the friendliest
place in Equestria.

02:19.207 --> 02:20.708
Shouldn't be hard.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.343
Need to make a new
friend, huh?

02:22.376 --> 02:23.777
I know just the
pony for you!

02:24.978 --> 02:26.414
Ms. Starlight
Glimmer,

02:26.447 --> 02:27.548
meet Mrs. Cake.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.487
How are you, dearie?

02:33.521 --> 02:35.189
Are you baking?
Can I help?

02:42.530 --> 02:46.400
Wow. Mrs. Cake! Look what
your "new friend" made you.

02:46.434 --> 02:49.570
Ah ha ha! New friend? I like
the sound of that. [gasp]

02:49.603 --> 02:51.472
Howza-whoza!

02:51.505 --> 02:53.474
Are you trying to put
me out of business

02:53.507 --> 02:55.509
with your fancy
magica-thingy-whatsit cake?

02:56.577 --> 02:57.545
[splat]

02:57.578 --> 02:59.247
Oh!

02:59.280 --> 03:00.481
Sorry!

03:02.916 --> 03:04.485
[slurp]

03:04.518 --> 03:07.321
In her defense,
it is delicious.

03:07.355 --> 03:08.522
[chomp]

03:09.957 --> 03:11.659
[crash]

03:11.692 --> 03:14.528
I think I have just the
pony for you, Starlight.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.696
Meet Big Mac.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.233
Eyup.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.502
He's not much
of a talker.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.404
Nope.

03:23.437 --> 03:26.340
Oh that's too bad. I
love a good conversation.

03:33.647 --> 03:37.718
Eyyyyyyyyup-yup-yeah-yeah-you
did something!

03:37.751 --> 03:40.388
Whoa! What's happening?
I feel really weird.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.590
I'm talking so much
and I'm so articulate

03:42.623 --> 03:44.592
enunciating with such
precise pronunciation!

03:46.827 --> 03:48.662
Annie Apple Awoke
And Accidentally Ate

03:48.696 --> 03:54.268
an Auburn Azalea!
Aaaah! MAKE IT STOP!

03:54.302 --> 03:56.570
[growl]

03:56.604 --> 03:59.373
I can't be friends with
somepony who doesn't talk.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.275
[growl]

04:01.309 --> 04:03.877
And I guess my first
instinct shouldn't be to

04:03.911 --> 04:06.380
magically command ponies to
act the way I want them to.

04:06.414 --> 04:07.981
[louder growl]

04:08.015 --> 04:09.717
All right! I'll
change him back!

04:11.552 --> 04:13.787
The trick to
finding a new friend

04:13.821 --> 04:16.056
is to render
yourself radiant.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.892
First impressions count
a great deal, you know.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.994
I'm glad you all got
past my first impression.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.399
Well, everypony deserves
a second chance!

04:25.433 --> 04:28.636
Oh now, I have a
top-notch idea.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.639
I'm thinking pastel
silk here and here,

04:31.672 --> 04:33.774
with crinoline underneath.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.444
You really think a new outfit
will help me meet ponies?

04:36.477 --> 04:40.080
Oh, with the right outfit,
you can do anything, darling.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.515
When will it be ready?

04:41.549 --> 04:42.916
Three weeks.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.052
Dinner's tomorrow.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.821
Well, then! How about
a hat from the, ahem,

04:47.855 --> 04:48.956
"clearance bin?"

04:54.395 --> 04:55.763
[grunt]

04:55.796 --> 04:56.897
Maybe not.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.734
Nopony's gonna make
friends with you

05:00.768 --> 05:02.870
because of your outfit.

05:02.903 --> 05:07.107
The only thing you want a new
friend draped in is coolness.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.409
Like you?

05:08.442 --> 05:10.978
Yeah, but you already
know me, so...

05:11.011 --> 05:14.114
[gasp] Spitfire!

05:14.147 --> 05:15.082
Sorry.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.784
Who's that?

05:16.817 --> 05:19.620
Only the Wonderboltiest
Pony in the Wonderbolts.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.888
Come on, I'll
introduce you!

05:25.158 --> 05:27.595
You coming or what?

05:27.628 --> 05:29.963
I guess my first
question would be...

05:29.997 --> 05:32.032
what's a Wonderbolt?

05:32.065 --> 05:35.703
You've never heard
of the Wonderbolts?

05:35.736 --> 05:37.771
Where have you been?

05:37.805 --> 05:41.041
Heh... enslaving
villages, I guess.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.610
Right.

05:45.045 --> 05:49.583
You're adorable, but probably
not what Twilight had in mind.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.827
What is going on?
This is Ponyville!

05:59.860 --> 06:01.962
If I can't make
a friend here,

06:01.995 --> 06:04.398
there's got to be
something wrong with me.

06:04.432 --> 06:05.633
[frustrated sigh]

06:05.666 --> 06:07.701
OK. Calm down.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.937
Nobody makes friends
with a total stress case.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.744
Stop stressing!
STOP STRESSING!

06:34.762 --> 06:38.432
Ahhh. This is just
what I needed.

06:38.466 --> 06:40.701
Tell me about it.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.870
You ever have one
of those days?

06:42.903 --> 06:45.038
For me, they're all
one of those days.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.807
Ha-ha-ha.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.578
I'm going to start coming here
every time I visit Ponyville.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.614
I'm not from here either. I've
been trying to make friends,

06:53.647 --> 06:56.550
but it's not easy.
They're not saying it,

06:56.584 --> 06:59.186
but I think everypony
knows about my past.

06:59.219 --> 07:03.023
I... may have been
a tiny bit...

07:03.056 --> 07:05.058
...completely and
utterly evil?

07:05.092 --> 07:07.895
Ponies judge me on
my past, too.

07:07.928 --> 07:11.431
Finally, a pony I
can relate to.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.837
Soup spoon, salad fork, pasta
spoon, strawberry pick.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.739
I'm beginning to think
that after Friendship,

07:18.772 --> 07:20.541
the greatest magic
of all...

07:20.574 --> 07:23.677
is proper silverware
placement. [giggle]

07:23.711 --> 07:26.246
Twilight, guess what!
I made a new friend!

07:26.279 --> 07:28.516
That's fantastic news.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.249
She's great!

07:29.282 --> 07:30.250
Great!

07:30.283 --> 07:31.485
She's powerful!

07:31.519 --> 07:32.486
Powerful?

07:32.520 --> 07:33.153
She's--

07:33.186 --> 07:36.223
Hello, Princess.

07:36.256 --> 07:37.791
* [horror sting]

07:37.825 --> 07:38.826
Trixie?

07:44.031 --> 07:45.733
You know each other?

07:45.766 --> 07:47.535
You could say that.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.837
We've had our
differences.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.740
What matters is Twilight
gave me a second chance

07:52.773 --> 07:54.642
and I appreciate it.

07:59.713 --> 08:02.650
So, um, what brings
you to Ponyville?

08:02.683 --> 08:07.054
The great and powerful
Trixie has come to perform

08:07.087 --> 08:12.292
a new stage show of grand
illusion. I'm calling it

08:12.325 --> 08:15.195
"The Humble and
Penitent Trixie's

08:15.228 --> 08:18.231
Equestrian Apology Tour."

08:18.265 --> 08:19.667
That's kind of
a mouthful.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.134
It's a working title.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.004
Starlight? A moment?
Over here?

08:27.708 --> 08:29.877
I know I said make
friends with "anypony,"

08:29.910 --> 08:33.213
but... well, with Trixie's
past and your past,

08:33.246 --> 08:35.949
I'm not so sure she's
the best "first friend."

08:39.653 --> 08:43.056
But whatever she did,
you've forgiven her, right?

08:43.090 --> 08:44.191
Of course.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.759
It's just...

08:45.793 --> 08:48.161
She wasn't the
nicest pony.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.965
Well, you did say anypony
and I just assumed

08:51.999 --> 08:54.001
that you'd trust me
to make my own friends

08:54.034 --> 08:57.037
the way Princess
Celestia trusted you.

08:57.070 --> 09:00.207
[sigh] You're
right. I trust you.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.075
Just be back in
time for the dinner.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.612
Thanks, Twilight.
You won't regret it.

09:07.247 --> 09:08.281
I hope not.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.019
Ugh.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.256
This Magic Show's gonna
be the greatest thing

09:16.289 --> 09:17.958
Ponyville's ever seen.

09:19.693 --> 09:25.265
[soft murmurs]

09:27.400 --> 09:30.838
Everypony always says they'll
give you a second chance,

09:30.871 --> 09:34.274
but deep down,
they never forget.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.009
That's what I'm
worried about.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.077
[sigh]

09:37.110 --> 09:38.612
What is it?

09:38.646 --> 09:42.716
I heard what Twilight said
about me and she's right;

09:42.750 --> 09:44.818
I wasn't very nice.

09:44.852 --> 09:48.055
So, I'd understand if you
didn't want to be friends.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.624
Are you kidding?
You're the first pony

09:50.658 --> 09:53.126
I've met who has
any idea how I feel.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.799
Can you keep a secret?

09:58.832 --> 10:01.735
What are friends for?

10:01.769 --> 10:03.136
The things I've done,

10:03.170 --> 10:06.039
I did them because I
was jealous of Twilight.

10:06.073 --> 10:08.075
She's just the
best at everything

10:08.108 --> 10:11.044
and I wanted to beat
her at something.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.780
Your secret's
safe with me.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.214
Thanks.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.849
Wanna help me
unpack my wagon?

10:18.085 --> 10:20.721
I spend a lot of time on
the road with my wagon,

10:20.754 --> 10:23.957
so it might be
a tad messy.

10:23.991 --> 10:27.828
Maybe I can help. I'm pretty
good at organizing stuff.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.197
Magic props,
brainwashed crowds.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.232
[giggles]

10:32.265 --> 10:37.270
Psssst! Psssst! Psssst!

10:38.305 --> 10:40.941
Shhhhh!

10:40.974 --> 10:44.311
Uh, I'll catch up. I think
there's something in my hoof.

10:44.344 --> 10:48.148
Sure, the wagon's right
around the corner.

10:48.181 --> 10:51.451
So. How's it going
with your new friend?

10:51.484 --> 10:54.922
Great. Thanks for asking in
a completely not creepy way.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.691
Because, you know, if it isn't
working out for any reason,

10:57.725 --> 10:59.426
I could introduce you
to my friend, here.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.863
Nice to meet you.

11:02.896 --> 11:05.098
No, no. You can
come out now.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.134
[electronic buzz]

11:07.167 --> 11:08.769
You like music, right?

11:08.802 --> 11:11.204
DJ-Pon3'd be the perfect
friend for tonight's

11:11.238 --> 11:14.407
incredibly important
dinner with Celestia.

11:14.441 --> 11:17.878
You know, if you decide to
make a last minute change.

11:17.911 --> 11:21.281
So... back at your castle
when you said, "I trust you,"

11:21.314 --> 11:24.151
you meant, "I
don't trust you."

11:24.184 --> 11:28.789
Who can really say who said
what? I know I can't. Can you?

11:30.523 --> 11:33.961
Starlight, I'm just trying
to look out for you.

11:33.994 --> 11:37.130
[sigh] I appreciate it, but
you're wrong about Trixie.

11:37.164 --> 11:40.400
She's just like me. We
have a real connection.

11:40.433 --> 11:44.838
That's kind of what I'm afraid
of. OH! What about her!

11:44.872 --> 11:46.974
[crash/thud]

11:47.007 --> 11:49.943
Please, Twilight! I know
you're trying to help,

11:49.977 --> 11:52.780
but I need to make
friends on my own

11:52.813 --> 11:54.848
if I'm going to
become a better pony.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.850
But do you really
think Trixie is the one

11:56.884 --> 11:58.251
to help you with that?

11:58.285 --> 12:00.453
Wow, Trixie was right.

12:00.487 --> 12:03.123
You're not really giving
her a second chance.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.959
I wonder what that says
about how you feel about me.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.533
Oh! Now he'd be PERFECT!

12:13.566 --> 12:14.734
Ugh.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.909
I was thinking.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.444
You said Twilight is better
than you at everything,

12:24.477 --> 12:27.781
but that's not true.
You're better at magic.

12:27.815 --> 12:30.050
Only when I'm wearing a
soul-sucking evil amulet,

12:30.083 --> 12:32.419
so I don't think
that counts.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.454
Funny story. Don't
need to get into it.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.556
I meant stage magic.

12:36.589 --> 12:42.195
Well, of course. Great?
Yes. Powerful? Obviously.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.832
But I'm not the best.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.400
As great and powerful
as I am,

12:47.434 --> 12:51.304
there's one trick I've
never been able to do.

12:51.338 --> 12:54.341
The Moon-shot
Manticore Mouth Dive.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.076
* [old-style piano]

12:56.109 --> 12:59.012
Only one magician has
ever pulled it off:

12:59.046 --> 13:02.315
my hero, Hoofdini.

13:02.349 --> 13:05.118
You are supposed to blast
yourself into the open mouth

13:05.152 --> 13:08.088
of a hungry Manticore.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.958
After the Manticore chews
you up and swallows you,

13:10.991 --> 13:13.093
you magically step
out of a box

13:13.126 --> 13:14.461
on the other side
of the stage.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.599
Completely unharmed.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.268
That sounds very...

13:21.301 --> 13:22.569
Dangerous?

13:22.602 --> 13:24.537
I was going to
say, "cool."

13:24.571 --> 13:26.940
I knew I liked you
for a reason.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.844
I don't know how he did it.

13:30.878 --> 13:33.346
If I tried it, I'd get
chewed up and swallowed

13:33.380 --> 13:35.182
by that Manticore.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.517
Not if you could
use real magic.

13:37.550 --> 13:40.921
Obviously. Way
to rub it in.

13:40.954 --> 13:44.491
No, I mean I could help.
You could start the trick

13:44.524 --> 13:46.193
and right before
you got chewed up,

13:46.226 --> 13:47.928
I could use magic
to save you

13:47.961 --> 13:51.131
and make you appear
in the black box.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.600
I guess that would work.

13:53.633 --> 13:58.471
But if you made one
mistake, I'd be a goner.

13:58.505 --> 14:02.075
When it comes to magic,
I don't make mistakes.

14:02.109 --> 14:05.612
Maybe I could be your...
"magic-show-helper-pony?"

14:05.645 --> 14:09.449
We call it "assistant" in
the magician biz and...

14:09.482 --> 14:12.319
nopony's ever offered
to help before.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.654
Well, I'd be honored.

14:14.687 --> 14:18.091
You may have just made my
great and powerful magic show

14:18.125 --> 14:21.895
even better, which I
didn't think was possible.

14:21.929 --> 14:25.432
We're gonna blow
them away tonight!

14:25.465 --> 14:28.535
Oh, I can't. Tonight's this

14:28.568 --> 14:31.371
"incredibly important"
dinner with Twilight.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.440
Oh.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.909
Can I vent for a minute?

14:35.943 --> 14:37.477
What are friends for?

14:37.510 --> 14:40.080
Even after Twilight
says she trusts me,

14:40.113 --> 14:41.581
she clearly doesn't
trust me enough

14:41.614 --> 14:44.284
to choose my own friends.

14:44.317 --> 14:48.121
I guess you were right.
No second chances.

14:48.155 --> 14:51.992
I wish I could say
I was surprised.

14:52.025 --> 14:55.628
Well, lucky for
"Princess" Twilight

14:55.662 --> 14:58.598
I have my magic
show tonight.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.201
If you have to go
to the dinner,

15:01.234 --> 15:03.436
I completely understand.

15:03.470 --> 15:06.373
I just hope I find
a way to survive

15:06.406 --> 15:11.178
the Moon-Shot Manticore Mouth
Dive without my new assistant.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.546
* [dramatic crescendo]

15:17.217 --> 15:20.220
[dripping]

15:22.522 --> 15:26.326
Starlight Glimmer should
be here any minute.

15:26.359 --> 15:31.498
Any... minute...
now. [nervous laugh]

15:31.531 --> 15:34.367
How about I
introduce everyone?

15:34.401 --> 15:38.071
Our friendship lessons
are going so well.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.173
She made three
new friends!

15:41.641 --> 15:44.111
She has such great
taste in friends.

15:44.144 --> 15:47.114
I don't know where she
would have learned that.

15:47.147 --> 15:50.750
Starlight Glimmer? I thought
you said nose-hair trimmers!

15:50.783 --> 15:54.454
What's going on? I'm hungry!
And my nose is too hairy!

15:56.323 --> 16:00.427
HAHA! Cranky Doodle,
you're so funny!

16:00.460 --> 16:03.230
If you'll excuse me, I'm
going to check the kitchen.

16:03.263 --> 16:07.067
Maybe she got lost amongst
the... artichokes.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.406
Starlight? Has anyone
seen Starlight Glimmer?

16:13.440 --> 16:14.574
I'm looking for her.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.580
Trixie!

16:20.613 --> 16:23.216
So this is the "The Humble
and Penitent Trixie's

16:23.250 --> 16:25.252
Equestrian Apology Tour."

16:25.285 --> 16:27.087
Ain't that a
mouthful of molasses.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.589
It's a working title.

16:29.622 --> 16:33.426
This is going to be the
greatest night of my life.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.163
Excuse me, our lives.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.199
I'm so glad that we're
not at that boring dinner.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.268
Twilight: Ahem.

16:41.301 --> 16:44.504
You just decided to skip our
dinner without telling me?

16:44.537 --> 16:46.573
Are you aware that
at this very moment,

16:46.606 --> 16:49.642
Princess Celestia is
waiting for you at a table--

16:49.676 --> 16:52.279
--with exquisite
silverware placement?

16:52.312 --> 16:53.346
Yes, but...

16:53.380 --> 16:55.048
This is exactly why

16:55.082 --> 16:57.117
I didn't want you to make
friends with Trixie.

16:57.150 --> 17:00.420
Ah-HA! You still
don't trust me!

17:00.453 --> 17:02.589
But guess what, "princess?"

17:02.622 --> 17:05.292
It doesn't matter if you want
to give me a second chance

17:05.325 --> 17:09.696
or not. Starlight had to
choose between you and me

17:09.729 --> 17:16.269
and she chose me! Your pupil
chose me! So HA. I win!

17:16.803 --> 17:20.573
You win? That sounds like you
just made friends with me

17:20.607 --> 17:22.509
to beat Twilight.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.111
Exactly!

17:25.612 --> 17:30.417
Wait. I mean, no! I got caught
up in the moment. I like you.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.419
Beating Twilight
is just a bonus.

17:32.452 --> 17:35.688
Oh, saying that
didn't help, did it.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.591
I should have known.
Nopony else in Ponyville

17:38.625 --> 17:42.295
wanted to be my
friend. Why would you?

17:42.329 --> 17:46.799
Wait! It's not like
that! I am your friend!

17:46.833 --> 17:48.701
Oh. [whimper]

17:48.735 --> 17:52.839
Well, you "won." I
hope you're happy.

17:52.872 --> 17:56.176
Looks like the great
and powerful Trixie

17:56.209 --> 17:59.546
is back to a solo show...

17:59.579 --> 18:01.381
Trixie?

18:01.414 --> 18:05.452
...which is exactly
the way she likes it.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.720
Thank you,
Princess Twilight,

18:07.754 --> 18:09.822
for getting rid of
that annoying pony

18:09.856 --> 18:14.561
who wanted to be my first
friend. I am not sad at all.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.164
I definitely don't feel
like my heart is breaking

18:17.197 --> 18:18.598
into a million pieces.

18:23.803 --> 18:27.407
Come one, come all!
Come and see

18:27.440 --> 18:30.877
"The Pathetic and Friendless
Trixie's Way-To-Go-Dumb-Dumb

18:30.910 --> 18:34.881
You-Really-Messed-It-Up-This-
Time Repentance Tour."

18:34.914 --> 18:36.849
[murmurs from the crowd]

18:36.883 --> 18:39.752
IT'S A WORKING TITLE!

18:39.786 --> 18:42.722
Behold, your fears come true...

18:42.755 --> 18:45.158
a pony-eating MANTICORE,

18:45.192 --> 18:48.228
[ferocious growl]

18:48.261 --> 18:50.830
for tonight, the great
and powerful Trixie

18:50.863 --> 18:55.202
will be performing the
Moon-shot Manticore Mouth Dive.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.836
[excited gasps]

18:56.869 --> 19:01.274
Now, now. Save your gasps
for when I defy the beast's

19:01.308 --> 19:06.246
jaws of doom and appear
inside that black box.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.315
I was supposed to
perform this trick

19:08.348 --> 19:10.883
with my great and
powerful assistant,

19:10.917 --> 19:13.820
who was also my great
and powerful friend.

19:18.558 --> 19:21.394
Starlight? When I first
came to Ponyville,

19:21.428 --> 19:24.664
Princess Celestia gave me
room to make my own decisions

19:24.697 --> 19:28.201
and my own friends. I need to
give you the same freedom.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.469
I shouldn't have tried

19:29.502 --> 19:31.338
to pick and choose
your friends for you.

19:33.906 --> 19:36.776
Just like me, you have to
make your own decisions...

19:36.809 --> 19:38.311
and your own friends.

19:39.946 --> 19:43.916
But, what if Trixie really was
using me just to one up you?

19:43.950 --> 19:46.486
From what I've seen...
she's the real thing.

19:50.657 --> 19:53.960
But it's not my place to
judge. It's all up to you.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.795
[roar]

19:58.298 --> 20:00.933
Starlight? If
you're out there

20:00.967 --> 20:02.969
and you still want
to be friends,

20:03.002 --> 20:06.639
let's be great and
powerful together.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.640
Please.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.946
[roar]

20:13.980 --> 20:15.482
Ahhhhh!

20:15.515 --> 20:16.983
[gulp]

20:17.016 --> 20:18.851
[burp]

20:18.885 --> 20:20.453
[shocked cries from the crowd]

20:25.892 --> 20:31.298
Behold, the pate and
growerful Triskee!

20:31.331 --> 20:32.365
[thud]

20:33.933 --> 20:36.936
[cheering]

20:44.411 --> 20:46.713
And now, I'm proud
to introduce

20:46.746 --> 20:49.916
my great and powerful
assistant...

20:49.949 --> 20:53.920
and best friend...
Starlight Glimmer!

20:53.953 --> 20:56.956
[cheers]

20:58.725 --> 20:59.926
Trixie!

20:59.959 --> 21:01.694
What do you want?

21:01.728 --> 21:04.331
I was wrong,
I'm sorry.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.998
And I have to hand
it to you.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.034
I could never have pulled
off a trick like that.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.939
Thank you... Princess.

21:16.876 --> 21:20.947
[explosions]

21:23.583 --> 21:27.420
[dripping]

21:27.454 --> 21:30.557
How do you get yer hair
to do that all the time?
