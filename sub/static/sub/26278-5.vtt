00:47.466 --> 00:49.003
What's this about?

00:49.268 --> 00:50.925
Before I tell you anything, Murdoch,

00:50.961 --> 00:53.024
you must agree to absolute secrecy.

00:53.035 --> 00:55.979
- No one can know that you're involved.
- I understand.

00:56.014 --> 00:59.224
His name is Gaetan Vidal,
a diplomat from France.

00:59.245 --> 01:01.804
I was acting as his host
but I had to leave briefly.

01:01.929 --> 01:03.549
When I returned...

01:03.752 --> 01:05.467
You'll see for yourself.

01:05.488 --> 01:06.993
Wait.

01:07.332 --> 01:08.786
What is it?

01:09.421 --> 01:11.860
I left a cigar band in the door jamb...

01:12.485 --> 01:15.376
and it was replaced in the wrong spot.

01:15.798 --> 01:18.007
Someone's gone inside.

01:32.653 --> 01:34.797
Woah!

01:35.200 --> 01:37.190
Terrence Meyers!

01:37.811 --> 01:39.764
Régine Rivière?

01:42.630 --> 01:44.312
That was for Prague!

01:45.401 --> 01:47.031
What are you doing here?

01:47.083 --> 01:48.938
I am Monsieur Vidal's attachée.

01:48.980 --> 01:50.705
I assume you are the host?

01:50.772 --> 01:52.836
How could you have let this happen?

01:53.340 --> 01:54.972
What happened?

02:02.343 --> 02:04.725
Who is this man? Why is he here?

02:06.590 --> 02:08.335
Detective William Murdoch.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.586
_

02:10.592 --> 02:14.275
_

02:14.739 --> 02:16.095
Oui.

02:16.651 --> 02:18.246
We can trust him?

02:18.277 --> 02:19.819
Yes.

02:21.507 --> 02:23.081
Then he must be informed.

02:23.128 --> 02:24.525
Yes.

02:24.931 --> 02:26.796
I must be informed.

02:28.276 --> 02:30.657
Murdoch, if we don't find
out who killed this man,

02:30.678 --> 02:34.080
the result will be the greatest
war this world has ever known.

02:45.037 --> 02:47.319
Vidal was here to sign a treaty.

02:47.580 --> 02:50.111
Canada was chosen as neutral ground.

02:50.132 --> 02:53.399
The treaty is to be between
Britain, Russia and France.

02:53.524 --> 02:56.775
But France is already allies
with Russia. And with Britain.

02:56.817 --> 02:59.072
But Britain and Russia remain enemies.

02:59.088 --> 03:02.527
This treaty will mend that
bridge and form a triple entente.

03:02.589 --> 03:03.995
An alliance strong enough

03:03.996 --> 03:06.830
to withstand an attack from
any nation on the planet.

03:07.408 --> 03:10.004
And you believe this
attack to be forthcoming?

03:10.040 --> 03:14.302
It's the mad Kaiser, Wilhelm.
He lusts for Weltmachtstellung.

03:14.567 --> 03:16.386
Weltmachtstellung?

03:16.407 --> 03:18.527
- World power.
- Without the triple entente,

03:18.548 --> 03:21.647
the entire world is vulnerable.
This treaty cannot fail.

03:21.850 --> 03:24.544
And now, one of the signatories is dead.

03:24.617 --> 03:28.019
I will telephone Paris and
arrange for a replacement.

03:28.045 --> 03:31.025
I believe our foreign secretary
is currently in Washington.

03:31.520 --> 03:35.498
We must insure that he and the
rest of the diplomats remain safe.

03:37.780 --> 03:41.156
Well, it appears he's
been stabbed several times.

03:41.432 --> 03:43.162
Likely bled to death.

03:43.702 --> 03:46.450
He knew his attacker
was about to strike.

03:47.935 --> 03:49.905
You can tell that by his pipe?

03:51.088 --> 03:52.781
Ceci n'est pas une pipe.

03:54.235 --> 03:56.048
Single shot pistol.

03:56.532 --> 03:58.872
I gave it to Vidal for protection.

03:59.554 --> 04:01.639
And he was just about to shoot?

04:01.858 --> 04:03.598
But the killer acted first.

04:05.531 --> 04:08.460
- I'll contact Miss Hart and request the post-mortem.
- Who?

04:08.502 --> 04:11.175
Miss Hart. She works under
Dr. Ogden at the morgue.

04:11.190 --> 04:13.368
Unacceptable. No one
else can know of this.

04:13.384 --> 04:15.505
I agree this Hart woman
cannot be involved,

04:15.525 --> 04:18.219
but Dr. Ogden is Murdoch's
wife. She can be trusted.

04:19.475 --> 04:21.272
They were drinking wine.

04:21.605 --> 04:24.909
The killer earned his
mark's trust, then struck.

04:25.185 --> 04:27.478
- Classic spy craft.
- A spy?

04:27.513 --> 04:29.807
- But for whom?
- Who else?

04:29.843 --> 04:32.673
Clearly the Germans would
want this treaty to fail.

04:36.497 --> 04:39.629
- What will I wear?
- Monty won't give a toss.

04:39.644 --> 04:42.860
He's an old army man. You
could have told me in advance.

04:42.895 --> 04:44.553
I only found out myself this morning.

04:44.563 --> 04:47.565
- I didn't think you'd want to come.
- Of course I'd want to come!

04:47.599 --> 04:49.589
Well, you didn't want to
come when Teddy was in town.

04:49.613 --> 04:51.372
Or when Whitey was in from New Zealand.

04:51.397 --> 04:53.680
Well, yes, but

04:53.706 --> 04:56.595
Monty is another matter altogether.

04:57.016 --> 04:59.421
- Excuse me, darling.
- I am simply glad

04:59.459 --> 05:02.176
an old friend of yours
is coming to town.

05:02.251 --> 05:03.793
Terrence Meyers!

05:04.060 --> 05:05.415
What brings you here?

05:05.861 --> 05:08.999
Well, I'm afraid that information
is classified, Inspector.

05:09.012 --> 05:10.487
Ah, but not to Murdoch.

05:10.516 --> 05:13.034
Detective Murdoch has
become involved, as

05:13.159 --> 05:16.361
has Dr. Ogden. I'm afraid
the list ends there.

05:16.536 --> 05:18.470
- It's a matter of...
- Let me bloody-well guess.

05:18.557 --> 05:19.979
National security?

05:20.475 --> 05:22.876
No. International security.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.380
Ah, Mrs. Hall!

05:36.280 --> 05:38.031
How are you liking your accommodations?

05:38.056 --> 05:40.674
- Do you think you'll be staying in the house?
- I do hope so.

05:41.154 --> 05:42.837
I thought you worked
on Saturdays, George.

05:42.871 --> 05:46.138
Yes, well, I do ordinarily, but
I saved up some of my off days

05:46.155 --> 05:47.660
and decided to spend some.

05:47.693 --> 05:49.395
Oh. A whole week-end off

05:49.411 --> 05:51.133
and you're spending it at home?

05:51.187 --> 05:54.746
Yes, well you have to think of
it as a stay-at-home vacation,

05:54.755 --> 05:57.810
- or as I like to call it, a "homecation".
- Mm.

05:57.897 --> 06:00.556
And old Miss Pratt has
you fixing the stoop?

06:00.577 --> 06:03.474
Yes, she didn't quite grasp the idea.

06:04.054 --> 06:05.643
Eric, what's the matter?

06:05.830 --> 06:09.131
- My motorcar's gone.
- Oh, your favourite toy.

06:09.152 --> 06:10.823
Where did you last see it?

06:10.998 --> 06:13.691
I was playing with it in
the park at the sandbox.

06:13.703 --> 06:16.474
Well, we'll go back and look as soon
as I finish hanging this washing.

06:16.599 --> 06:18.604
I don't mind taking
him for a look around.

06:18.654 --> 06:20.950
I could use the stroll.
What do you say, Eric?

06:21.213 --> 06:23.014
It may be for the best, Constable.

06:23.043 --> 06:25.039
You see, I think it was stolen.

06:26.398 --> 06:28.907
We were both new to
the world of espionage.

06:29.328 --> 06:32.112
Me, a rugged youth of the Great Lakes.

06:32.507 --> 06:35.670
And she, a coy nymph from
the mountains of Alsace.

06:36.429 --> 06:38.909
Of course, ours was a
love that couldn't last,

06:39.180 --> 06:41.372
for love dies in dishonesty.

06:41.548 --> 06:44.153
We couldn't go on with
such suspicion in our minds,

06:44.278 --> 06:46.751
but while it burned, Murdoch,

06:47.104 --> 06:49.342
the intensity was such that...

06:49.372 --> 06:51.260
I believe I've found something.

06:52.681 --> 06:54.325
Oh. Fingermarks?

06:54.532 --> 06:56.936
Indeed. A full set from a right hand,

06:56.962 --> 06:58.929
but not just any right hand.

06:59.004 --> 07:01.738
The killer had six fingers.

07:02.318 --> 07:03.960
We have a problem.

07:04.085 --> 07:05.565
The Russians have arrived.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.839
- They were scheduled to arrive tomorrow.
- Well, they're here.

07:08.874 --> 07:11.733
Apparently, they informed
Vidal by telephone last night.

07:13.554 --> 07:15.917
Then they know Vidal
was here. It's over.

07:16.497 --> 07:18.357
Not necessarily.

07:18.373 --> 07:20.340
Tell them Vidal is indisposed.

07:20.373 --> 07:24.149
That we'll stall them until your
men from Washington can arrive.

07:24.170 --> 07:25.171
It won't work.

07:25.225 --> 07:28.090
The Russian diplomat,
Evgeny Dorokhov, is a coward.

07:28.260 --> 07:31.020
Appointed only because he
is the tsarina's nephew.

07:31.095 --> 07:34.024
If he senses something
is amiss, he will flee.

07:34.266 --> 07:36.025
And if he informs the tsarina...

07:36.046 --> 07:38.572
Then the chances for an accord are over.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.728
There's only one way out.

07:44.108 --> 07:45.963
Allow the Russians to walk away

07:46.005 --> 07:49.614
and we convince King Eddy to make
peace with his nephew, the Kaiser.

07:50.064 --> 07:51.944
The rest of the world
may fall to Deutschland,

07:51.956 --> 07:53.316
but at least Britain will be safe.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.841
_

07:54.871 --> 07:58.147
The German will confront France
first and take Paris in forty days.

07:58.272 --> 07:59.785
France will just have to fight.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.326
I have an idea.

08:03.603 --> 08:05.979
Someone will pose as Vidal.

08:06.517 --> 08:08.025
Nobody knows he's dead.

08:08.838 --> 08:10.576
We pretend he's still alive,

08:10.585 --> 08:12.536
just until his replacement arrives.

08:12.611 --> 08:13.682
Oh.

08:15.020 --> 08:16.812
Fine idea, but I don't speak French.

08:17.137 --> 08:18.425
Not you.

08:19.111 --> 08:23.156
Vidal's build, his
hair, even his face...

08:23.281 --> 08:24.985
Doesn't it resemble someone?

08:25.389 --> 08:27.057
Someone who we know is fluent...

08:27.683 --> 08:28.995
en français.

08:31.809 --> 08:32.990
No.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.298
- No...
- Murdoch,

08:35.698 --> 08:38.595
the fate of the world
lies in your hands.

08:45.482 --> 08:47.483
I can see a bit of resemblance.

08:47.812 --> 08:49.546
I don't have a...

08:49.846 --> 08:51.614
And I'm much more...

08:52.206 --> 08:53.836
We don't look anything alike.

08:53.852 --> 08:56.696
Murdoch, none of these people
have ever seen Vidal before.

08:56.708 --> 08:58.451
All you have to do is play the part.

08:58.530 --> 09:01.293
I can't impersonate a political figure.

09:01.305 --> 09:03.435
Why not? You've
impersonated an anarchist.

09:03.485 --> 09:06.033
And a workman. And a homosexual.

09:06.674 --> 09:08.284
You're taking his side?

09:08.675 --> 09:10.259
It seems important.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.244
Well, I suppose someone needs
to protect the Russian diplomat

09:15.267 --> 09:16.945
in case the killer strikes again.

09:17.107 --> 09:18.191
Bien !

09:18.791 --> 09:21.446
I will need to brief you before
we meet with the Russians.

09:21.484 --> 09:22.604
On what?

09:22.934 --> 09:24.706
Monsieur Vidal has a reputation

09:24.726 --> 09:26.786
in the world of international diplomacy.

09:27.199 --> 09:28.428
For example,

09:28.449 --> 09:31.850
it is well known I am
more than his attachée.

09:32.159 --> 09:33.593
How much more?

09:34.398 --> 09:36.477
I am also his lover.

09:40.941 --> 09:43.596
- Did you know that?
- No.

09:43.816 --> 09:45.221
No, I did not.

09:45.388 --> 09:47.443
Did you see anybody playing over there?

09:47.964 --> 09:49.714
Right, then. Well, in that case,

09:49.839 --> 09:51.807
if we don't have any witnesses,

09:51.837 --> 09:55.432
I suggest the first thing
we do is look for a clue.

09:55.473 --> 09:57.187
- A clue?
- Evidence.

09:57.241 --> 10:00.651
A clue as to who might have been here.

10:00.660 --> 10:02.093
For example,

10:02.810 --> 10:04.095
this footprint.

10:04.111 --> 10:07.241
Now, this sand gets
washed around all the time,

10:07.258 --> 10:09.796
so we can assume that
this footprint is fresh.

10:09.838 --> 10:11.372
And by the shape of it,

10:11.385 --> 10:14.515
I would say it belongs to a girl.

10:14.548 --> 10:16.625
You mean a girl stole my motorcar?

10:16.862 --> 10:20.043
This footprint either belongs
to the most notorious toy thief

10:20.055 --> 10:22.440
this city has ever known, or possibly

10:22.515 --> 10:24.978
to a young girl who knows
something about your toy car.

10:25.003 --> 10:27.262
A toy thief! She must be stopped!

10:27.537 --> 10:31.418
Well, we'll come by tomorrow
and see if we can spot her.

10:31.868 --> 10:34.431
In the meantime, uh,

10:34.646 --> 10:37.232
I'm off to get some ice cream.

10:37.282 --> 10:39.025
You wouldn't care for
some, I don't suppose?

10:39.037 --> 10:41.755
Children are not fancy
on ice cream, are they?

10:43.388 --> 10:46.900
As I said, the Russians are looking
for an excuse to flee to Moscow.

10:46.950 --> 10:49.526
We must not give them
any such opportunity.

10:50.163 --> 10:53.764
The truth is, France stands to
lose the most if this treaty fails.

10:54.127 --> 10:57.178
Follow my lead. If in doubt,
agree to whatever they ask.

11:04.739 --> 11:08.898
Now, what if the German
spy tries to kill, um...

11:09.640 --> 11:11.816
What's the Russian diplomat's name?

11:11.866 --> 11:13.137
Evgeny Dorokhov.

11:14.129 --> 11:15.505
I will be watching.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.955
If a threat appears,
I will strike first.

11:18.018 --> 11:19.272
Strike?

11:21.868 --> 11:23.090
Dart gun.

11:23.444 --> 11:24.728
Not fatal but

11:24.763 --> 11:27.298
it will render a man
unconscious in moments.

11:30.359 --> 11:31.726
Hidden blade.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.382
Handcuffs. Steel.

11:36.708 --> 11:39.025
The key is on my necklace.

11:41.113 --> 11:42.618
And of course...

11:45.386 --> 11:47.424
some things a woman keeps secret.

11:47.741 --> 11:48.891
Now,

11:49.679 --> 11:51.079
for you.

11:52.834 --> 11:54.160
What does it do?

11:54.231 --> 11:56.457
It is a pen. It writes.

11:56.645 --> 11:58.950
Oh. That... that's all?

11:59.504 --> 12:02.477
It is Vidal's pen. Custom-made.

12:02.567 --> 12:03.865
He used to boast of it.

12:03.886 --> 12:05.532
He has been photographed with it.

12:06.053 --> 12:08.775
He used to carry it always
in his breast pocket.

12:09.107 --> 12:11.172
If you were to use anything else,

12:11.180 --> 12:13.484
a clever spy would spot you as a fake.

12:15.385 --> 12:16.756
Are you ready?

12:17.211 --> 12:18.720
I think so.

12:19.241 --> 12:20.583
Great.

12:20.750 --> 12:22.730
Then, put your arm around me.

12:27.550 --> 12:30.930
Uh... is this how you hold your lover?

12:32.014 --> 12:33.927
It's how I hold my wife.

12:34.794 --> 12:37.701
You Canadians are as
cold as your weather.

12:37.826 --> 12:39.441
You are meant to be French.

12:39.566 --> 12:41.021
Move your arm lower.

12:43.359 --> 12:44.842
Lower.

12:46.126 --> 12:47.468
Lower.

12:48.847 --> 12:52.146
I'm a married man. I don't
know if I can do this.

12:53.047 --> 12:57.078
Detective, if the Russians
discover you're an impostor,

12:57.123 --> 12:58.420
they will kill us.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.859
You cannot merely play
the part of a Frenchman.

13:01.893 --> 13:04.271
You must become a Frenchman.

13:05.639 --> 13:07.139
D'accord.

13:14.404 --> 13:18.084
Ah, Monsieur Vidal!

13:18.119 --> 13:21.876
Oh ! Regardez donc ça,
cette petite bête mignonne !

13:21.905 --> 13:24.055
Don't get too close. It bites.

13:24.180 --> 13:28.141
This is not always a bad
thing, hein, ma chérie ?

13:28.704 --> 13:30.625
You, what do you want?

13:30.675 --> 13:33.285
- The food you ordered, sir.
- Leave it and get out.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.961
Before we eat, business.

13:38.469 --> 13:40.682
Ah, mais oui !

13:40.995 --> 13:44.221
I think you have misgivings
about this treaty.

13:44.634 --> 13:47.727
Russia is happy to join France
in alliance with Britain,

13:47.739 --> 13:49.219
but there is one thing.

13:49.240 --> 13:51.508
You hear about
unpleasantness at Tsushima?

13:51.528 --> 13:55.010
Mm, yes. You lost a war with Japan.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.515
It is behind us.

13:58.583 --> 14:02.167
But Moscow does not trust Japanese.

14:02.584 --> 14:04.730
From Shanghai, we could...

14:04.818 --> 14:06.323
How do you say it?

14:06.907 --> 14:08.616
Keep one eye on them.

14:08.896 --> 14:09.950
Mm.

14:10.271 --> 14:12.760
What does France have to do with this?

14:13.010 --> 14:15.565
Well, France has
concessions in Shanghai.

14:16.011 --> 14:19.813
We will sign treaty if
you give us Shanghai.

14:21.317 --> 14:22.701
Oh.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.690
I will speak with Paris.

14:26.815 --> 14:30.657
Paris? Vidal, are you not a
man who can make decisions?

14:31.432 --> 14:33.124
I make it simple.

14:33.474 --> 14:36.759
No Shanghai, no treaty.

14:38.693 --> 14:40.381
Give him what he wants.

14:44.708 --> 14:45.913
No.

14:48.259 --> 14:49.972
- No?
- No!

14:50.010 --> 14:53.165
If you would like concessions with
Shanghai, you speak to the British.

14:53.290 --> 14:55.825
France will not bow down to threats.

14:59.446 --> 15:01.630
For a moment, I thought I
was dealing with a child!

15:01.660 --> 15:03.831
We would have preferred
to walk, but this...

15:04.152 --> 15:07.037
Da, this is man I like!

15:07.519 --> 15:09.720
Ah, Pavel! There you are.

15:09.845 --> 15:11.525
I believe you know Vidal.

15:11.833 --> 15:13.897
Old friends, yes?

15:18.897 --> 15:21.261
Mais oui, Pavel !

15:21.898 --> 15:24.516
So very nice to see you again.

15:28.543 --> 15:31.269
Nice to see you as well, Gaetan.

15:42.460 --> 15:45.561
Uh, please excuse, us, Pavel,

15:45.603 --> 15:48.192
may I have a word outside?

15:48.537 --> 15:49.674
All right.

16:03.238 --> 16:06.218
What are you? German? Where is Vidal?

16:06.259 --> 16:07.932
You killed him!

16:08.623 --> 16:10.296
Let him go.

16:12.926 --> 16:16.531
- Is it true? Vidal is dead?
- He is.

16:16.590 --> 16:19.312
And your fingermarks, all six of them,

16:19.324 --> 16:21.454
- were found in his room.
- So?

16:21.579 --> 16:22.833
You killed him!

16:22.900 --> 16:25.197
Why else would you pretend
to think that I was Vidal?

16:25.230 --> 16:26.777
You had to hide the fact that you,

16:26.815 --> 16:28.957
and only you, knew he was dead.

16:29.082 --> 16:32.059
If Vidal is dead, the
entente is at risk.

16:32.072 --> 16:33.698
I didn't want Dorokhov
to suspect anything.

16:33.722 --> 16:35.514
He wants a reason to leave.

16:37.395 --> 16:38.733
Then you're on our side.

16:41.361 --> 16:43.438
I'm on the side of peace.

16:44.772 --> 16:46.241
But who are you?

16:46.366 --> 16:48.774
A man also on the side of peace.

16:48.899 --> 16:51.462
- Hey, I think we should go inside before...
- Pavel and Vidal!

16:51.467 --> 16:52.888
What is going on?

16:55.547 --> 16:58.082
- Mon amour, ma passion brûle !
- Oui !

16:58.111 --> 17:00.237
Viens, viens !

17:02.148 --> 17:03.276
They left.

17:03.763 --> 17:05.138
They're French.

17:08.327 --> 17:10.833
Her cigarette case was a knife!

17:10.874 --> 17:14.635
And there was this
strange animal on a leash,

17:14.661 --> 17:16.127
a man named Pavel,

17:16.144 --> 17:19.007
and I saved Shanghai!

17:20.958 --> 17:23.642
You seem to have taken to
your role with some relish.

17:24.021 --> 17:26.606
Well, when you take on a persona,

17:26.627 --> 17:29.587
when you truly inhabit
another being, in essence,

17:29.609 --> 17:33.054
you become that person.

17:33.880 --> 17:37.158
And you became a
Frenchman, with a mistress!

17:37.339 --> 17:40.869
Is that why you're still in
that ridiculous suit and beard?

17:40.886 --> 17:42.682
Oh, I can't take it off.

17:42.707 --> 17:45.337
If anyone were to see
me out of character,

17:45.358 --> 17:47.513
it could ruin our entire gambit.

17:48.043 --> 17:49.185
I see.

17:49.195 --> 17:50.469
It's not because you...

17:51.069 --> 17:52.665
like the suit and beard?

17:53.228 --> 17:55.313
No. No, no, no, don't be silly.

17:55.479 --> 17:57.034
Now, what have you found?

17:57.293 --> 18:00.910
Well, the real French diplomat, not you,

18:00.940 --> 18:02.373
died of a stab wound.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.741
The blade was short and thin,
but it had a significant hilt.

18:05.770 --> 18:08.230
And the thrusts were
violent, causing bruising.

18:08.284 --> 18:10.017
There were four thrusts to the chest

18:10.018 --> 18:11.698
and one to the side of a thigh.

18:12.619 --> 18:13.761
A thigh?

18:14.511 --> 18:15.621
A glancing blow?

18:15.841 --> 18:17.932
No, just as violent as the others.

18:18.588 --> 18:21.368
Why would the killer
stab him in the thigh?

18:23.935 --> 18:26.153
Perhaps you should ask your mistress.

18:29.035 --> 18:30.882
When I was there, Vidal was fine.

18:31.591 --> 18:34.146
But he did ask for me to come
so he could tell me something.

18:34.175 --> 18:35.188
What?

18:35.592 --> 18:37.317
He said the Germans were in Toronto.

18:37.338 --> 18:39.305
He wanted me to protect Dorokhov.

18:39.338 --> 18:40.735
How did he know this?

18:41.081 --> 18:42.310
He did not say.

18:42.365 --> 18:44.607
But he believed someone
was surveilling him.

18:45.049 --> 18:48.379
What exactly happened in the
hallway when Dorokhov came out?

18:48.408 --> 18:50.447
- What?
- Between these two, I mean.

18:50.480 --> 18:53.352
- Their little charade.
- How, quiet down, you fool.

18:53.623 --> 18:55.937
Why would Vidal inform
you of this and not me?

18:55.988 --> 18:57.392
I do not know.

18:57.801 --> 19:00.856
But Vidal was writing
something. A telegram.

19:00.906 --> 19:02.144
What did it say?

19:02.690 --> 19:04.116
It was in code.

19:07.259 --> 19:08.872
_

19:08.885 --> 19:10.598
_

19:10.723 --> 19:13.145
_

19:13.324 --> 19:15.213
_

19:15.251 --> 19:17.481
_

19:18.302 --> 19:20.152
Is the French really necessary?

19:20.186 --> 19:22.837
Mr. Meyers! What a nice surprise!

19:22.866 --> 19:24.580
Ah, Mr. Ainsworth!

19:24.600 --> 19:26.842
- Just in from London, are you?
- Yes, that's right.

19:26.897 --> 19:29.565
And this must be the
delegation from France?

19:29.807 --> 19:33.899
Yes. Yes. Monsieur Vidal,
please meet Mr. Ainsworth here.

19:33.933 --> 19:36.884
- Counterpart from Britain.
- Ah. It is a pleasure.

19:38.973 --> 19:40.472
Mademoiselle Rivière.

19:40.848 --> 19:42.774
Monsieur Vidal's attachée.

19:42.995 --> 19:45.638
Attachée? I see.

19:46.559 --> 19:48.744
What a pleasant coincidence
to bump into you.

19:48.982 --> 19:50.953
Now, you really must join me inside.

19:50.966 --> 19:53.350
I'm about to sit down and have
a drink with a dear old friend.

19:53.374 --> 19:55.663
One of the finest
Britons in the New World.

19:56.876 --> 19:58.173
Monsieur Vidal !

19:58.210 --> 20:01.145
Please meet Inspector
Thomas Brackenreid.

20:02.325 --> 20:05.350
Steady on! You two don't
know one another, do you?

20:06.155 --> 20:08.605
As it happens, we do!

20:08.651 --> 20:11.964
What a surprise to see you
again, Inspector Brackenreid!

20:11.993 --> 20:13.565
A surprise indeed!

20:13.602 --> 20:16.841
- What was the name again?
- Vidal! Gaetan Vidal!

20:17.574 --> 20:21.117
As you can see, Mr. Ainsworth,
is has been a very long time

20:21.147 --> 20:23.656
since the Inspector and I
have been face to face, uh?

20:23.676 --> 20:25.381
I suppose it has.

20:25.439 --> 20:30.299
- When was the last time we saw each other?
- 19... 01!

20:30.328 --> 20:33.046
- Monte Carlo, the baccarat table!
- Is that right?

20:33.062 --> 20:35.113
Clearly, you had too much whiskey!

20:35.361 --> 20:37.342
And I see you're here with Mr. Meyers.

20:37.376 --> 20:39.589
- Yes, Inspector...
- And who might this be?

20:40.030 --> 20:43.001
Mademoiselle Rivière.
Monsieur Vidal's attachée.

20:43.036 --> 20:45.311
Monsieur Vidal's proclivity
for beautiful attachée's

20:45.328 --> 20:47.629
- is known the world over.
- Is it?

20:47.754 --> 20:49.588
That must be nice.

20:50.676 --> 20:52.981
There you are, you old devil!

20:53.006 --> 20:54.298
Oh, Margaret.

20:54.348 --> 20:56.824
What a pleasure to lay
eyes upon you again.

20:56.861 --> 20:59.093
Oh, the pleasure is mine.

20:59.454 --> 21:01.126
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm late.

21:01.139 --> 21:03.836
I just simply had to
stop and buy you a box

21:03.853 --> 21:06.187
of these lovely bonbons.

21:06.196 --> 21:09.370
There's nothing more lovely
than your bonbons, Margaret.

21:09.422 --> 21:10.768
Margaret, dear!

21:10.785 --> 21:12.598
You remember Monsieur Vidal?

21:12.627 --> 21:14.561
I don't think I know a Mons... Oh!

21:15.019 --> 21:17.362
- William?
- Mais non ! Ha! Ha!

21:17.412 --> 21:19.213
Clearly, it has been a very long time

21:19.242 --> 21:21.839
since I have seen Mrs. Brackenreid.

21:22.044 --> 21:25.508
- Gaetan Vidal.
- What? What is going on?

21:25.516 --> 21:27.755
- And who is this woman?
- Mademoiselle Rivière...

21:27.763 --> 21:29.930
Oh no, I don't care about your name.

21:29.959 --> 21:33.065
- I want you to get your hands off of him!
- Margaret, it's all right!

21:33.082 --> 21:35.824
It's none of our business how the
French wish to flaunt themselves.

21:35.850 --> 21:39.618
Alors,we have very much
important business to attend to.

21:39.651 --> 21:42.952
Au revoir ! Au revoir.

21:43.180 --> 21:44.727
_

21:44.777 --> 21:47.299
_

21:47.521 --> 21:49.030
_

21:49.042 --> 21:50.551
- Sir!
- What?

21:51.322 --> 21:52.635
Oh, yes.

21:52.973 --> 21:55.516
These are all telegrams sent
from this hotel last night.

21:55.537 --> 21:57.112
Every one sent by every guest.

21:57.412 --> 22:00.943
Did you receive any
strange communication?

22:01.218 --> 22:03.315
Sentences that did not make sense?

22:03.323 --> 22:06.321
- Unintelligible characters?
- No.

22:06.586 --> 22:07.813
Nothing like that.

22:07.863 --> 22:11.023
So Monsieur Vidal never gave
you any message of any kind?

22:11.306 --> 22:13.485
Why don't you ask Monsieur Vidal?

22:19.556 --> 22:22.444
The telegram was gone by the
time I found Vidal's body.

22:22.532 --> 22:24.245
So the killer must have taken it.

22:24.304 --> 22:26.642
We need to find a way to
draw him out, otherwise...

22:31.373 --> 22:33.040
Someone's trying to kill me!

22:35.266 --> 22:36.879
Or perhaps Monsieur Vidal.

22:40.477 --> 22:41.865
Murdoch, are you all right?

22:41.890 --> 22:43.357
The bullet missed me.

22:43.403 --> 22:46.045
I saw the shooter. Well,
not the shooter himself,

22:46.049 --> 22:48.146
but a rifle barrel on the
third floor of the hotel.

22:49.118 --> 22:51.423
It's clear. Hurry!

23:00.934 --> 23:03.385
Excusez-moi ! Pardon !

23:05.585 --> 23:07.820
- No luck.
- Nothing here either.

23:10.590 --> 23:11.701
Hey!

23:12.793 --> 23:14.723
Did you see anyone up
here? Hear anything?

23:14.848 --> 23:16.136
Uh, like what?

23:16.148 --> 23:18.308
A rifle was fired from this floor.

23:18.349 --> 23:21.059
I didn't hear anything.
I'm just eating my lunch.

23:22.330 --> 23:23.702
Heu...

23:23.973 --> 23:26.465
How long have you been
working in this place?

23:26.856 --> 23:29.283
- A week or two.
- Mm.

23:29.443 --> 23:31.933
You always eat a sandwich for lunch?

23:32.058 --> 23:34.180
- Every day.
- Every day?

23:34.305 --> 23:36.777
Like this, in the supply closet?

23:36.902 --> 23:38.227
Yes.

23:38.528 --> 23:40.521
What's this about, Vidal?

23:40.796 --> 23:44.651
Do you always use a knife
and fork for your sandwich?

23:45.297 --> 23:46.956
- Dear God!
- What?

23:46.981 --> 23:48.856
Eating a sandwich with a knife and fork

23:48.877 --> 23:51.533
is customary in only one
country so far as I know.

23:51.596 --> 23:54.326
- Germany.
- He's a spy! Hey!

23:54.330 --> 23:56.568
Es liebe Deutschland!

24:05.359 --> 24:08.423
Cyanide. Along with a
couple of other poisons

24:08.443 --> 24:10.265
designed to act immediately.

24:11.140 --> 24:13.640
Clearly, he had secrets
he didn't want us to learn.

24:14.191 --> 24:16.012
So you're saying that this chap

24:16.137 --> 24:19.146
tried to stop Britain from signing
in treaty with France and Russia?

24:19.333 --> 24:21.421
France being represented by you?

24:21.509 --> 24:23.880
I'm sorry we couldn't
let you in on it sooner.

24:23.951 --> 24:26.407
- And then you caught him and he killed himself?
- Yes, sir.

24:26.649 --> 24:27.966
What a waste.

24:28.091 --> 24:30.625
If Britain's gonna team up with
anyone, it should be Germany.

24:30.750 --> 24:32.505
We're related to their bloody king!

24:32.672 --> 24:35.101
- Kaiser.
- Yes, him.

24:35.117 --> 24:37.811
Found in the ceiling
of the supply closet,

24:38.081 --> 24:40.232
along with many communiqués

24:40.311 --> 24:42.416
proving he was, in fact, a German spy.

24:42.770 --> 24:44.899
- Then we have our killer.
- Unfortunately not.

24:44.978 --> 24:48.445
When I left Vidal last night, it was
to transfer my luggage to my room.

24:48.446 --> 24:49.996
The bellboy helped me do it.

24:50.701 --> 24:52.180
He must have a compatriot.

24:52.893 --> 24:54.502
I also found this.

24:55.415 --> 24:57.524
Seems he did intercept Vidal's telegram.

24:57.549 --> 24:59.037
What does it say?

25:00.221 --> 25:02.676
It's a code, intended for me.

25:02.726 --> 25:05.532
It says, "Toronto is compromised.

25:05.983 --> 25:08.701
Our friends are not our friends."

25:08.705 --> 25:10.001
What does that mean?

25:10.185 --> 25:13.302
It means that whoever killed
Vidal is on the inside.

25:13.498 --> 25:15.778
And he is trying to stop the treaty.

25:18.255 --> 25:21.039
George! How is your home vacation going?

25:21.073 --> 25:22.902
Very well, thank you, Mrs. Hall.

25:22.990 --> 25:25.533
- Oh, my! Is that... ?
- Oh, yes.

25:25.578 --> 25:27.662
Turns out Eric left it at his cousin's.

25:27.787 --> 25:29.517
He never took it to the park at all.

25:29.900 --> 25:31.088
Really?

25:32.363 --> 25:35.301
He and I had planned on
recanvassing the area this afternoon.

25:36.256 --> 25:39.167
Oh, well, he'll be glad
to have it back, I suppose.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.459
Uh, Mrs. Hall?

25:44.218 --> 25:45.981
Might I suggest something?

25:46.911 --> 25:49.199
Well, this is rather a surprise!

25:49.241 --> 25:51.995
I wish I could say I
wasn't calling with... Oh.

25:52.020 --> 25:54.880
Sorry, I thought you'd
finished moving in.

25:55.051 --> 25:57.081
- We have.
- Oh.

25:57.377 --> 25:59.435
And this is the sitting room, then?

25:59.648 --> 26:01.911
And the dining room, as you can see.

26:02.186 --> 26:03.395
Oh.

26:04.253 --> 26:06.413
Anyway, as I was saying,

26:06.438 --> 26:09.572
I wish I wasn't calling
with such dire news.

26:11.964 --> 26:13.806
Oh, dear.

26:15.557 --> 26:16.887
What is it?

26:18.092 --> 26:21.190
Another woman is laying
hands on your husband.

26:21.386 --> 26:24.519
Oh, that, yes. I know about that.

26:24.544 --> 26:26.174
And you've allowed this?

26:26.416 --> 26:28.830
It's very important.

26:29.451 --> 26:32.219
I can't disclose why William
is doing what he's doing,

26:32.231 --> 26:34.220
but I can assure you it's...

26:34.232 --> 26:35.603
it's all an act.

26:36.717 --> 26:38.572
I know the Detective is a good man,

26:38.697 --> 26:41.002
but men are not as strong as us.

26:41.127 --> 26:42.334
Is that so?

26:42.369 --> 26:44.454
When women feel the urge of temptation,

26:44.479 --> 26:47.414
we may entertain it in our minds,

26:47.444 --> 26:49.457
but it goes no further.

26:49.519 --> 26:52.337
But men! Men aren't like that at all.

26:53.225 --> 26:56.936
I trust William. And like
I said, it's all an act.

26:58.270 --> 27:01.937
You know best, Julia. And it
really is none of my business,

27:01.984 --> 27:05.491
but I saw that woman with
her hands on your husband.

27:05.525 --> 27:09.461
And trust me, she has an
eye for William Murdoch.

27:12.466 --> 27:14.321
So the Russians or the English.

27:15.087 --> 27:16.634
One is working against us.

27:16.681 --> 27:20.160
I have observed nothing
suspicious from either delegation.

27:20.196 --> 27:21.608
We must proceed.

27:22.015 --> 27:24.743
- It's dangerous.
- If the killer is there, we will stop him.

27:24.778 --> 27:28.414
But we will attend the treaty this
afternoon and ensure everyone signs.

27:28.681 --> 27:30.239
Yourself included.

27:31.152 --> 27:32.940
I can't actually sign.

27:33.065 --> 27:34.621
Why not?

27:34.637 --> 27:35.959
No one will ever know.

27:36.330 --> 27:38.822
Once it's done, I will
tell Paris Vidal died

27:38.826 --> 27:40.306
- shortly after the signing.
- Meyers.

27:43.257 --> 27:45.861
Meet me in my room. I have
something I must discuss with you.

27:45.899 --> 27:47.820
No! Are you certain?

27:49.300 --> 27:51.284
Yes.

27:53.494 --> 27:54.752
I should have known.

27:56.324 --> 27:58.116
I can't believe I didn't see it.

27:58.462 --> 28:02.325
She uses her feminine wiles
to seduce you, body and mind.

28:02.716 --> 28:04.034
Rivière?

28:04.205 --> 28:06.198
She never contacted Paris about Vidal.

28:06.210 --> 28:08.341
There is no replacement
diplomat on the way.

28:08.370 --> 28:10.929
- She's been lying to us.
- What? Why?

28:10.970 --> 28:12.391
Because she killed him.

28:12.742 --> 28:15.380
Her intention all along
was to stop this treaty.

28:15.672 --> 28:17.411
You believe she is the traitor?

28:17.452 --> 28:20.045
Obviously, she expected you
to fail when posing as Vidal,

28:20.049 --> 28:21.533
and when you didn't,

28:21.568 --> 28:23.442
she enlisted the bellboy to kill you.

28:23.963 --> 28:26.747
I'm expected to meet
her in her room shortly.

28:28.669 --> 28:30.528
We can't reveal we're onto her.

28:31.078 --> 28:34.454
What? Meyers, she's already
tried to kill me once!

28:34.763 --> 28:38.552
Murdoch, you must live
to sign this treaty.

28:38.677 --> 28:40.819
The world hangs in the balance.

28:45.379 --> 28:46.925
Thank you for coming.

28:47.633 --> 28:48.927
Of course.

28:49.471 --> 28:51.251
What did you want to see me about?

28:52.018 --> 28:53.956
I should think it would be obvious.

28:56.420 --> 28:58.901
We cannot go on like this any longer.

29:01.630 --> 29:04.282
Go on... like what?

29:05.168 --> 29:09.769
Go on pretending the passion
between us is only an act.

29:11.561 --> 29:15.454
But... it is an act.

29:15.891 --> 29:17.611
Isn't it?

29:21.341 --> 29:23.900
Oh, you're right.

29:24.483 --> 29:26.229
I feel it too.

29:32.492 --> 29:33.816
But...

29:33.998 --> 29:36.661
- But we can't.
- Why not?

29:36.723 --> 29:39.579
Because we must remain focused.

29:39.704 --> 29:42.114
The treaty must be the
most important thing.

29:44.325 --> 29:45.706
Yes.

29:46.290 --> 29:48.150
I suppose you're right.

29:53.595 --> 29:56.127
Oh! Oops.

29:56.162 --> 29:58.134
I drink yours.

29:58.816 --> 30:00.624
You'll have to have mine.

30:04.969 --> 30:07.642
Go ahead. Drink.

30:14.369 --> 30:16.266
You fool.

30:16.980 --> 30:18.445
So,

30:18.976 --> 30:22.666
Meyers has convinced you I am
out to kill you, is that it?

30:22.689 --> 30:25.135
That's right! You're a traitor!

30:25.172 --> 30:28.183
You never telephoned Washington
to ask for the other diplomat.

30:28.501 --> 30:31.436
If you had half a mind, you
would see we do, in fact,

30:31.456 --> 30:32.899
have a traitor in our midst.

30:32.974 --> 30:35.345
- Terrence Meyers.
- Meyers?

30:35.550 --> 30:36.825
He killed Vidal.

30:36.863 --> 30:38.346
I was sure when I realized

30:38.351 --> 30:40.076
he was the one who stole the telegram.

30:40.114 --> 30:43.123
But Meyers claims that the
bellboy intercepted the telegram.

30:44.645 --> 30:47.446
Oh, but the bellboy never met Vidal,

30:47.454 --> 30:50.493
otherwise he would have
known that I wasn't him.

30:50.523 --> 30:52.857
Which means Vidal never
gave him the telegram

30:52.924 --> 30:54.921
and Meyers had it all along.

30:54.950 --> 30:57.200
He lied to us. He is the traitor!

30:58.542 --> 31:00.159
I am not a traitor.

31:02.043 --> 31:05.228
This is Prague all over again, isn't it?

31:05.794 --> 31:09.379
You mean your paranoia nearly
ruining an entire operation?

31:09.408 --> 31:11.892
Oh, no. No, I mean your lying

31:11.921 --> 31:14.031
and manipulating to get what you want.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.827
It's never been about what I want!

31:15.844 --> 31:18.541
- It's always you, you and you!
- What a damn lie!

31:18.544 --> 31:20.871
I offered you the world
and you spat it back at me!

31:20.884 --> 31:22.909
- What?
- Yes! Do you have any idea

31:22.949 --> 31:24.893
how long I waited...

31:26.106 --> 31:27.382
Murdoch?

31:28.182 --> 31:30.662
- That's enough.
- I don't know where he is.

31:30.746 --> 31:32.467
Shall I let him know that
you're looking for him?

31:32.491 --> 31:34.659
No, no, it's not important.

31:34.688 --> 31:36.960
Murdoch, this is outrageous!

31:37.014 --> 31:39.052
Arrest her, certainly, but me?

31:39.098 --> 31:41.670
- Murdoch!
- Come, come, Detective, this is silly.

31:41.695 --> 31:45.050
After all we've been through,
after how close we've become,

31:45.371 --> 31:47.506
surely you trust me over Meyers?

31:48.618 --> 31:49.922
In fact,

31:49.976 --> 31:51.576
Mademoiselle Rivière,

31:52.406 --> 31:54.398
I trust neither of you.

31:54.444 --> 31:56.445
Therefore, you leave me no choice.

31:56.503 --> 32:00.167
I will have to sign this treaty
and find the killer myself.

32:07.590 --> 32:08.844
Hello.

32:13.378 --> 32:15.900
William, that woman was all over you,

32:15.984 --> 32:18.188
right here, in the middle
of the station house!

32:18.209 --> 32:19.401
She's...

32:19.418 --> 32:21.652
Mademoiselle Rivière
did get carried away.

32:21.689 --> 32:23.778
But Julia, it's all an act.

32:25.441 --> 32:27.996
One you're not quite
ready to give up, it seems.

32:28.041 --> 32:30.050
What exactly do you intend to do?

32:30.175 --> 32:32.329
I intend to go to the treaty signing.

32:32.413 --> 32:35.035
And the killer? Is it
Meyers or the woman?

32:35.068 --> 32:36.689
I believe it's neither.

32:36.802 --> 32:39.586
But I don't trust them, so I've
removed them from the equation.

32:40.358 --> 32:43.209
So there'll be an assassin
present at the treaty?

32:43.334 --> 32:44.624
Mais oui.

32:44.659 --> 32:46.485
And I intend to catch him.

32:48.396 --> 32:50.053
William, this is very dangerous.

32:50.074 --> 32:51.871
They've already tried to kill you once!

32:51.892 --> 32:54.647
That was the German bellboy.
He's no longer a threat.

32:54.676 --> 32:57.686
Besides, the killer now
knows that I am an impostor

32:57.707 --> 33:00.300
- and has no reason to kill me.
- I'm going in there with you.

33:00.346 --> 33:02.460
Absolutely not! It's far too dangerous.

33:02.497 --> 33:04.865
- You just said it wasn't...
- Monsieur Vidal!

33:06.049 --> 33:07.608
Nice to see you again.

33:07.888 --> 33:10.672
And who might this
beautiful young woman be?

33:11.451 --> 33:12.889
Sheila Walker.

33:13.077 --> 33:14.377
Ainsworth.

33:15.023 --> 33:18.099
I'm Monsieur Vidal's attachée.

33:18.579 --> 33:20.043
Australian?

33:20.069 --> 33:23.851
Uh... What they lack in refinement,

33:23.872 --> 33:27.212
they make up for with ardor.

33:29.837 --> 33:32.458
Are you quite sure
about bringing a woman

33:32.489 --> 33:34.563
to the signing of such
an important treaty?

33:34.761 --> 33:36.786
You can trust me, Mr. Ainsworth.

33:36.819 --> 33:38.695
I'm not new to this game.

33:39.257 --> 33:40.742
And Gaetan,

33:40.940 --> 33:43.514
he can't bear to be away from me.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.345
You see what I mean?

33:50.851 --> 33:52.617
We've already looked everywhere.

33:52.633 --> 33:55.647
Well, that's true, but if I've
learned anything as a police constable,

33:55.668 --> 33:57.676
it's that a second
go-around can sometimes

33:57.677 --> 33:59.711
uncover the most valuable clues.

33:59.836 --> 34:03.082
I'll poke about over here and
you have a look over there.

34:11.384 --> 34:13.172
Constable!

34:15.964 --> 34:18.953
A bit a shoelace, in here!

34:19.078 --> 34:20.335
A footprint!

34:20.460 --> 34:22.774
- The same ones!
- My goodness!

34:22.799 --> 34:25.288
That could be our thief! We
need to follow them, Eric.

34:26.771 --> 34:27.943
Here.

34:28.331 --> 34:29.981
And there's two there!

34:30.014 --> 34:32.047
- Oh, look at that big one!
- You've got it!

34:32.065 --> 34:33.600
There's some over here...

34:35.934 --> 34:37.737
The prints stop here.

34:37.772 --> 34:39.764
Well, that's it. That's
a dead end, I suppose.

34:39.774 --> 34:41.989
- Maybe we should just go home.
- Wait!

34:49.362 --> 34:52.304
It's here!

34:52.429 --> 34:54.277
Excellent, Eric! Well done!

34:54.310 --> 34:57.215
The villain may have
fled but most importantly,

34:57.232 --> 35:00.303
we have recovered your
motorcar. Case closed!

35:04.726 --> 35:06.798
Of course I never
called for the diplomat!

35:06.799 --> 35:09.125
Our man in Washington
never supported the treaty.

35:09.129 --> 35:10.809
It would have derailed the whole thing!

35:11.046 --> 35:13.743
And you know full well
why I stole that telegram.

35:13.830 --> 35:15.594
Because you killed Vidal!

35:16.356 --> 35:20.237
I found Vidal dead, with
the telegram on the desk.

35:20.262 --> 35:22.472
So you just went ahead and took it?

35:22.488 --> 35:23.981
Of course I took it!

35:25.211 --> 35:27.795
You really think I'd hand it over
to you after what happened in Prague?

35:27.816 --> 35:30.047
Oh, for the last time,
Prague was your fault!

35:31.291 --> 35:34.305
Everything I did, I did out of love!

35:44.925 --> 35:46.239
Wait a minute

35:47.132 --> 35:50.156
if you didn't kill Vidal
and I didn't kill Vidal...

35:50.723 --> 35:52.550
The traitor is still out there.

35:53.267 --> 35:55.061
Murdoch is in a great deal of danger.

35:55.519 --> 35:57.360
Then what are we waiting for?

35:58.145 --> 35:59.787
We're locked in.

36:03.272 --> 36:05.598
Locks are meant to be picked.

36:07.928 --> 36:11.140
Vidal!

36:11.508 --> 36:13.233
I heard some alarming news.

36:14.063 --> 36:16.394
Oh? What is it?

36:16.519 --> 36:18.861
My source had informed me you were dead.

36:21.849 --> 36:23.567
But clearly, my source is not correct.

36:23.588 --> 36:25.963
You can't trust anyone, these days.

36:26.847 --> 36:28.915
Now, we sign?

36:30.395 --> 36:34.378
Yes, it will be France's great pleasure

36:34.503 --> 36:37.090
to sit at a table with
your great nations.

36:37.124 --> 36:38.620
And for Britain as well.

36:38.707 --> 36:41.629
Today will be a glorious day for
peace and safety the world over.

36:41.650 --> 36:43.097
Yes, yes... can we get on about this?

36:43.121 --> 36:44.997
Before we sign, here's an idea.

36:45.122 --> 36:47.423
Why don't we swap pens?

36:47.469 --> 36:49.452
The symbol of the unity of our nations.

36:49.461 --> 36:52.762
- I like this. To show we are friends, yes?
- Precisely, sir.

37:01.636 --> 37:04.809
Well, history awaits, gentlemen!

37:05.922 --> 37:09.069
As France is our common
ally, Monsieur Vidal,

37:09.123 --> 37:11.412
would you like the
honor of signing first?

37:19.770 --> 37:22.800
No. I will not sign.

37:23.504 --> 37:26.213
I believe this pen is
intended to kill me.

37:26.267 --> 37:29.850
And Monsieur Ainsworth is a traitor.

37:29.975 --> 37:33.565
I've never heard of anything
so absurd in my life. Here!

37:39.813 --> 37:41.364
See?

37:41.489 --> 37:44.643
Now, what is all this about?

37:46.102 --> 37:49.337
Oh, uh, it seems I have made a mistake.

37:49.358 --> 37:51.916
Please accept my apologies,
Monsieur Ainsworth.

37:52.041 --> 37:55.354
It is this pen that
is the deadly device.

37:55.396 --> 37:58.116
Look! When pressed to
paper, a pin is triggered,

37:58.195 --> 38:02.003
- poisoning he who writes with it.
- Dear God, I almost...

38:02.034 --> 38:04.277
Someone is trying to kill me!

38:04.467 --> 38:06.009
You!

38:06.447 --> 38:08.291
You gave me this pen!

38:08.724 --> 38:11.756
Sir, I'm sorry not to
have said this earlier.

38:11.813 --> 38:14.533
This man is not Vidal!
He is an impostor!

38:15.231 --> 38:18.233
Are you quite sure
about bringing a woman

38:18.264 --> 38:20.697
to the signing of such
an important treaty?

38:20.718 --> 38:22.266
Get him!

38:46.505 --> 38:49.443
- No! Ah!
- Wait!

38:49.464 --> 38:52.059
Wait!

38:52.079 --> 38:55.212
You have to believe me.
Ainsworth planted that pen

38:55.243 --> 38:57.297
in my pocket. He's behind all of this!

38:57.331 --> 38:59.797
- I've done nothing wrong!
- You give this pen,

38:59.800 --> 39:02.538
- I kill you now!
- Vidal is dead!

39:02.663 --> 39:06.320
I sent you the telegram
telling you Vidal is dead.

39:06.362 --> 39:08.920
You! But why?

39:09.925 --> 39:12.349
I also sent a telegram to Ainsworth

39:12.370 --> 39:14.578
- saying the same thing.
- What's he saying? Just kill...

39:14.582 --> 39:16.881
I knew that the
innocent man would assume

39:16.902 --> 39:19.935
that the man he knew as
Vidal, me, would be dead

39:19.972 --> 39:21.673
and therefore would be surprised

39:21.694 --> 39:23.678
when I came walking through the door.

39:23.736 --> 39:26.362
- As you were.
- Don't listen to him! The man is a traitor!

39:26.378 --> 39:28.804
But the guilty man would
assume that telegram

39:28.850 --> 39:30.876
was referring to the
man he had already killed

39:30.893 --> 39:32.548
and therefore would do nothing.

39:32.673 --> 39:34.194
And that was Ainsworth.

39:34.277 --> 39:36.937
- Ainsworth is the traitor.
- Enough of this nonsense.

39:36.958 --> 39:38.546
I'll kill him myself!

39:39.017 --> 39:42.273
Stop! Drop that weapon! Right now!

39:55.913 --> 39:58.528
Mr. Ainsworth, you are
under arrest for murder.

39:58.557 --> 40:00.424
You can't arrest me, I'm a diplomat!

40:00.445 --> 40:03.129
- I killed for England.
- Last I checked, Monty,

40:03.163 --> 40:07.017
King Edward doesn't care
much for treason. Come on.

40:10.768 --> 40:13.285
- Pas mal.
- Merci.

40:16.861 --> 40:19.546
This was all very confusing, yes,

40:19.550 --> 40:22.568
but now, I believe I understand.

40:22.603 --> 40:24.837
Englishman want to kill Vidal,

40:24.872 --> 40:27.595
but instead kill impostor.

40:27.720 --> 40:30.309
And you, Vidal,

40:30.318 --> 40:32.644
you use this to set trap.

40:32.690 --> 40:35.091
Ha! Ha! Ha! Very clever!

40:36.003 --> 40:39.685
Ah oui !It appears you
understand everything.

40:43.577 --> 40:47.012
What is important is Mr. Dorokhov knows

40:47.137 --> 40:49.864
this British madman was not
acting on behalf of Britain.

40:52.366 --> 40:55.716
Mr. Steele will contact London
as soon as he is feeling better.

40:56.020 --> 40:57.704
He surely will hang Ainsworth

40:57.717 --> 41:00.006
and Britain will still
wish to form the entente.

41:00.505 --> 41:03.568
If you, gentlemen, will agree
to sign at a future date?

41:03.610 --> 41:06.655
If my friend Vidal say "yes", so do I.

41:06.694 --> 41:10.049
Bien sûr ! France will
be most eager to sign;

41:10.083 --> 41:12.227
- soon, I hope.
- Good!

41:12.606 --> 41:15.252
Now, let me talk to Mr. Steele

41:15.286 --> 41:17.482
about small matter of Shanghai.

41:21.283 --> 41:24.185
I'm not a German spy,
I'm a British patriot!

41:24.802 --> 41:26.344
You agree with me, don't you, Tom?

41:26.402 --> 41:28.107
Agree with what, exactly?

41:28.432 --> 41:30.632
I was only doing
what's best for Britain.

41:30.657 --> 41:33.272
We can't ally ourselves
with France and Russia.

41:33.883 --> 41:36.542
The tsar is weak and the French, well...

41:36.809 --> 41:39.948
- Not really my cup of tea, I must admit.
- Precisely.

41:39.952 --> 41:43.929
The Germans are our friends.
Tom, it's not too late!

41:43.950 --> 41:47.189
- For what?
- To let me out. I can stop this treaty.

41:51.436 --> 41:54.193
I don't know much about
international politics,

41:54.625 --> 41:56.829
but I do know a killer when I see one.

41:58.101 --> 41:59.535
Oh, and Monty,

41:59.602 --> 42:01.315
if they ever do let you out,

42:01.869 --> 42:03.745
keep your eyes off my wife.

42:06.840 --> 42:08.917
The entente will be saved.

42:09.209 --> 42:10.743
So thank you, Murdoch.

42:11.644 --> 42:13.899
The world was saved in Toronto today.

42:14.024 --> 42:15.712
It's a shame no one will ever know.

42:15.954 --> 42:18.722
I do have one question, however.

42:18.738 --> 42:21.497
When Mademoiselle Rivière
and I were accusing you

42:21.526 --> 42:24.633
of being a traitor, how did you know?

42:25.420 --> 42:28.033
He had a microphone in the flower pot.

42:28.079 --> 42:29.930
He heard every word we said.

42:30.113 --> 42:33.710
- And you knew of this?
- I figured it out.

42:34.415 --> 42:37.103
Why did you think I was
trying to seduce you?

42:37.465 --> 42:39.345
I was making our friend jealous.

42:39.470 --> 42:41.561
When Terrence Meyers runs hot,

42:41.686 --> 42:44.551
no man on Earth burns with such passion.

42:59.423 --> 43:02.232
You shot that man with a pocket watch!

43:02.295 --> 43:03.704
And that codger,

43:03.829 --> 43:05.467
how did he get the pen into...

43:05.680 --> 43:07.972
I threw a knife at the killer!

43:08.494 --> 43:10.836
Yes, it was all quite exciting.

43:10.961 --> 43:12.426
And dangerous.

43:12.496 --> 43:15.241
William, we saved the western world!

43:17.544 --> 43:18.852
Yes, we did.

43:20.832 --> 43:23.941
Well, I should take all of this off.

43:24.291 --> 43:26.187
Don't you dare.

43:27.271 --> 43:29.851
Tonight belongs to Sheila Walker

43:29.976 --> 43:31.740
and Monsieur Vidal.

43:31.802 --> 43:35.327
Oh... Comme vous désirez, ma chérie.
