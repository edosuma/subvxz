CARTER:
Previously on Eureka...

00:03.337 --> 00:05.874
When I thought about going
to Titan, | always thought
about doing it with you.

00:06.006 --> 00:06.961
I am sorry.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.422
I don't know how I feel
about a lot of things.

00:09.593 --> 00:11.584
And I am trying
to figure it out.

00:11.970 --> 00:15.383
A house isn't a home
unless you share it with
the person that you love.

00:15.766 --> 00:16.926
Living together, huh?

00:17.100 --> 00:18.135
Just think about it.

00:21.063 --> 00:22.849
HENRY: Ground Commander
Henry Deacon here.

00:22.981 --> 00:25.688
We set our sights
on Titan and many
thought it impossible,

00:25.817 --> 00:28.559
but that's what
we specialize in
at Global Dynamics.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.607
Today is the day
all of Eureka
should be proud of.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.651
This is our
moment in history.

00:37.996 --> 00:38.985
(BEEPING)

00:41.208 --> 00:42.539
Hey, you.
Hey.

00:42.668 --> 00:43.657
Big day, huh?

00:43.794 --> 00:45.910
Oh, hadn't noticed.
Oh, you're so cute.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.877
Yeah.
I'm sorry I rushed
out on you this morning.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.962
Oh, that's...
I had final software
flight checks.

00:50.092 --> 00:53.425
Then I spilled coffee on
my blouse, had to run
back to my place to change.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.169
You know, the way to
avoid that is actually

00:55.305 --> 00:58.968
if you have your blouse
and your stuff at my house.

00:59.101 --> 01:00.591
Yes, I know.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.513
I'm sorry,
it's a big decision
moving in together.

01:02.646 --> 01:04.637
I don't want us to leap
before we look.

01:05.107 --> 01:07.723
I've always been
a leap blindly sort of guy.

01:07.859 --> 01:11.317
Really? Like in the
four years it took you
to finally ask me out.

01:13.949 --> 01:15.064
So you'll just get
back to me whenever then?

01:15.200 --> 01:16.280
Yeah, I'll see you
at the launch.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.775
Okay. All right. That's...

01:20.747 --> 01:21.736
(SIGHS)

01:26.003 --> 01:28.335
Can you believe
this morning we watched
the sun rise on Earth,

01:28.463 --> 01:30.670
and tonight we'll watch
Saturn set on Titan?

01:31.049 --> 01:33.210
Well, technically
Saturn never sets.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.085
Titan's tidally locked,
so the same hemisphere
always faces Saturn.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.007
Oh, it is so hot
that you know that.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.760
(BEEPING)

01:43.020 --> 01:47.639
Wow. We're going to go
farther than man has
ever gone before.

01:48.025 --> 01:52.439
Speaking of that,
I've been thinking
about us going farther.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.235
Really?

01:54.364 --> 01:58.482
A lot. ljust really
want our first time
to be something special.

02:00.996 --> 02:02.156
Me, too.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.704
But we're kind of
running out of time.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.755
Not if our first
time was on Titan.

02:11.798 --> 02:16.212
Dr. Fargo, are you
suggesting we join
the billion-mile-high club?

02:16.345 --> 02:18.006
Mmm-hmm.
Oh.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.169
(DEVICE BEEPING)

02:20.474 --> 02:21.589
Mmm.

02:25.312 --> 02:28.270
Oh, final bio-pod
demo. Ready?

02:28.982 --> 02:29.937
Safety first.

02:33.904 --> 02:34.984
ALLISON: Okay, everyone,

02:37.991 --> 02:41.199
We anticipate
that long-distance,
faster-than-light travel

02:41.328 --> 02:43.740
exerts incredible
stresses on the body.

02:44.164 --> 02:48.407
The bio-pods on Astraeus
will be your cocoon for
yourjourney to Titan.

02:48.543 --> 02:49.999
Zane, can I use you?

02:50.379 --> 02:52.370
lfl had a nickel
for every... Nah.

02:52.798 --> 02:53.787
Never mind.

02:56.468 --> 03:00.006
So once your oxygen mask
and monitors are attached,

03:00.138 --> 03:03.926
the chamber will fill
with stasis gel designed
by our own Dr. Parrish.

03:04.059 --> 03:06.892
The gel will maintain
your core body temperature

03:07.020 --> 03:09.978
and it will also buffer
the high g-forces that
we expect to occur

03:10.107 --> 03:13.190
during the acceleration
and deceleration pulses.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.815
We wouldn't want
anyone to turn into
a pancake upon arrival.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.730
It's a shame your
goo is going to Titan
without you, Parrish.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.402
It's quite all right,
Dr. Fargo.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.151
l whipped up a very
special batch just for you.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.863
In the unlikely event
of pod failure,

03:27.999 --> 03:31.992
the emergency life support
seats that you passed when
you came in will activate.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.713
Strap in, hold on tight,

03:33.839 --> 03:37.297
it will be a bumpy ride,
but it will be your best
chance of getting there alive.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.883
Thank you, Dr. Blake.
Questions?

03:40.178 --> 03:41.554
Can I trade pods
with someone else?

03:42.431 --> 03:44.171
Any other questions?

03:45.058 --> 03:45.968
GRACE: No? Good.

03:46.101 --> 03:49.969
Okay, we will see you
onboard at T minus
two hours to lock you in.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.346
Let's go.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.559
I'm trying to keep cool,
but I am really excited.
Are you excited?

03:57.696 --> 03:59.561
Nah, I don't...
I'm so excited.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.981
Are you excited?
Yeah, I'm so excited
I have to pee.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.990
I'm going to go do
my pre-flight checklist.
Okay.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.243
Oh, hey, Jo.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.868
Hey.
Isn't this amazing?

04:10.000 --> 04:10.989
It is amazing.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.867
Billion-mile journey,
you ready?

04:14.004 --> 04:15.244
Absolutely, yes.

04:15.714 --> 04:19.878
Sort of. Still a smidge
nervous about the whole
billion mile thing.

04:20.010 --> 04:23.878
Hey, you are the last person
that should be nervous about
leaping into the unknown.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.050
Look what you've done
as director of G.D.

04:27.642 --> 04:31.009
Jo, we both know
they handed me the job.
I didn't earn it.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.058
Okay, well,
maybe other Fargo didn't,

04:34.191 --> 04:36.773
but you definitely proved
that you were up to the job.

04:36.943 --> 04:40.310
Can you even remember
the last time that you
pushed the wrong button?

04:41.573 --> 04:43.689
Actually, no.
See?

04:44.576 --> 04:49.946
Look, whatever happens,
I know you can handle it.
Carpe diem, right?

04:50.999 --> 04:52.910
Thanks, Jo.
(LAUGHS) Come here.

04:54.961 --> 04:55.996

04:58.006 --> 05:00.292
Larry said that you were
looking for me. What's up?

05:00.717 --> 05:03.379
Yeah, there is,
um, something that
I need to ask you.

05:04.221 --> 05:07.008
lwas, uh, hoping we
could keep it between us.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.006
Of course. Come on.

ready to bring the

it going, Commander?

05:22.989 --> 05:24.525

05:24.991 --> 05:27.607
This is really it.
Six months apart.

05:29.246 --> 05:31.988
You know what?
This is going to be hard.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.455
Couldn't we just
postpone it one more day?

05:34.584 --> 05:35.960
I mean,
you're mission commander.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.371
You could pull some strings.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.870
Yeah, you know,
I probably could,
but our safest launch window

05:40.006 --> 05:41.997
is between
18:23 and 20:37.

05:42.133 --> 05:45.091
We've done billions
of calculations that
factor in the orbit of Titan

05:45.220 --> 05:47.882
and Saturn, solar winds,
radiation pressure...

I'm going to miss you.

05:51.601 --> 05:52.977
Oh, I'm going to
miss you, too.

Oh, that's appropriate.

Uh, the big-ass

the Astraeus launch.

say "big-ass battery"?

Uh, the cooling

11:14.799 --> 11:16.209
they're all going
to be obsolete.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.878
If it just stores
the energy,

11:18.011 --> 11:21.219
then how did it shoot
a particle bursty thing
down Main Street?

11:21.347 --> 11:23.679
It didn't.
That's not
what they do.

11:24.142 --> 11:27.976
Okay. How about
in combination
with one of those?

11:29.647 --> 11:30.602
(CHUCKLES)

11:30.732 --> 11:32.848
(SARCASTICALLY)
Oh, the bomb closet. Oh.

11:32.984 --> 11:33.939
Yeah, yeah, okay, okay.

11:34.068 --> 11:37.231
Okay, I used to work
in unconventional weapons,
okay, back in the day.

11:37.488 --> 11:40.855
All right? I keep those
relics around just to remind
me of what I used to do.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.323
What I used to do.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.407
Before.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.993
Yeah, but now
I'm totally about
positive energy.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.494
And bombs...

11:47.624 --> 11:49.239
Bombs are super negative.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.620
(SIGHS) My rods do good.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.460
"Rods"? Plural?
You mean there are
more of those things?

11:54.589 --> 11:58.958
Yes. The array
consists of 15 rods
spread around Eureka.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.835
Well, 14 now.

12:02.597 --> 12:04.007
Do you have
a map of the array?

12:04.265 --> 12:07.723
Oh, you mean did I kill
a tree, so I can write it
down for your convenience? No.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.683
Okay, will you email it to us?

12:09.812 --> 12:12.724
Computers are not
biodegradable and neither
is that thing, by the way.

12:12.857 --> 12:13.812
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)

12:13.942 --> 12:15.603
You know,
there's no need to be rough.
I do have rights.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.724
Mmm-hmm.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.563
I'll give you guys a minute.

12:18.696 --> 12:19.651
Shenﬁ?
Yeah?

12:19.781 --> 12:20.861
JO: So what were we talking
about a minute ago?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.070
I can show you where
all the arrays are.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.565
Is this going to end
any time soon?

12:23.701 --> 12:24.690
No.
(EXCLAIMS)

12:26.496 --> 12:28.953
Oh, my God.
Mom, this is so tight.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.620
(LAUGHS) Thought you
might like to see this.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.581
Oh, my God, this is
a real bio-stasis pod?

12:35.964 --> 12:38.546
(LAUGHS)
It's pretty cool, huh?

12:39.717 --> 12:40.968
Can I try it out,
Mom, please?

12:41.094 --> 12:44.257
No, honey, I'm sorry.
There's all sorts of sensors
and nanotech injections

12:44.389 --> 12:46.801
you have to do
before you get in.
It's a whole big thing.

12:47.475 --> 12:50.137
You're crazy, Mom.
I can't believe you didn't
want to go on this thing.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.720
And miss six months
with a surly teenager?
Are you kidding me?

12:55.066 --> 12:58.308
Um, Kevin, lwant
to ask you something.

12:58.778 --> 12:59.767
Yeah?

13:03.324 --> 13:08.239
How would you
feel about all of us
moving in with Jack?

13:09.289 --> 13:12.952
You mean like us living
together in his house?

13:13.418 --> 13:16.706
Well, I mean,
yeah, it would be
our house, too.

13:16.838 --> 13:20.626
But what do you think?
And be honest.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.758
Would SARAH clean my room?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.971
I imagine so.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.470
Yes. Okay, cool.
I'm in. I'm in.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.261
(LAUGHS)

13:38.026 --> 13:40.984
Okay, my
dorsal-finned friends.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.979
We'll have you
spawning in no time.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.069
Hey.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.245
Hey.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.706
Good day, Sherriff, Jo.

13:57.462 --> 13:58.793
Dr. Plotkin.

13:59.630 --> 14:03.339
Well, Taggart, I see
you're still experimenting
on God's creatures.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.587
Would you please
explain to Dr. Plotkin

14:05.970 --> 14:08.962
that my research
benefits all life
on this planet,

14:09.223 --> 14:11.430
not just the electricity-
consuming kind?

14:11.559 --> 14:12.674
And would you
please tell him...

14:12.810 --> 14:13.970
Stop! I like that plan.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.018
We're just here for his rod.

14:18.066 --> 14:20.182
Eyesore.
Good riddance.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.772
You know what an eyesore is?
That tank you call a truck.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.771
Ignore him, Taggart.
Your truck is special.

14:27.075 --> 14:29.612
(LOUD CLANKING)

14:37.752 --> 14:38.867
Not anymore.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.095
My truck! She's gone!

14:48.721 --> 14:51.007
I know. That was amazing.
Did you see that?

14:51.307 --> 14:52.672
Did... Yeah.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.390
Definitely not an
assassination plot.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.008
It could be.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.302
Probably not.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.395
My mind cannot
begin to process what
just happened here.

15:00.525 --> 15:03.016
Well, process this,
could your rods
be responsible?

15:03.152 --> 15:04.562
Do you really
think that's possible?

15:04.987 --> 15:06.488
That's why I'm asking you.

15:06.614 --> 15:09.777
You owe me a new rig,
mate. That beauty
was one of a kind.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.192
That beast was
a gas-guzzling
monstrosity.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.829
She ran on ethane.

15:13.955 --> 15:17.072
Oh, enough!
Whatever's happening
could be tied to the rods.

15:17.542 --> 15:18.531
So let's turn them off.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.750
It's not like there's
a big master "off" switch.

15:20.878 --> 15:24.041
They don't operate on
some corporate synergistic
programming, Sheriff.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.879
They're individual entities.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.048
So we shut them
off one at a time.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.594
Come on.
It'll be like old times.
We'll do it together.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.506
You hate jobs like this.
Have you met you?

15:34.642 --> 15:37.850
Well, maybe I am
learning to appreciate
the simple things in life.

15:37.979 --> 15:38.843
Right on, sister.

15:38.980 --> 15:40.015
Ow!
Don't call me sister.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.228
Ow!

15:41.357 --> 15:43.848
Taggart, Plotkin, okay,
you guys take the
west side of town.

15:43.985 --> 15:45.316
Jo and I will take
the east. Right?

15:45.445 --> 15:46.400
What?
Come on.

15:46.529 --> 15:47.894
Wait... Wait. Oh.
Holy Christmas.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.281
Well, I guess I'm driving.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.613
Don't push it, mate.

15:50.992 --> 15:52.072
Get the rod!

15:55.121 --> 15:57.954
Oh, you get it.
Waste of skin.

16:02.712 --> 16:03.952
Oh, officer on deck.

16:07.467 --> 16:13.212
Well, here we are,
hours before the single
most historic space flight

16:13.347 --> 16:14.473
since we walked
on the moon.

16:14.891 --> 16:17.473
We have all sacrificed
a lot to be here,

16:17.727 --> 16:20.389
as have our families
and our loved ones.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.684
Six months is
a very long time.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.984
And those months
will test us in ways
we can't imagine.

16:28.863 --> 16:29.773
But with the support

16:29.906 --> 16:32.067
of our community
and each other

16:32.200 --> 16:34.566
we will get through
this together.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.952
I am honored
to be your captain.

16:39.207 --> 16:42.950
Well, that's it. I will see
you all at 1600 hours.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.967
What do you think
she meant when she said
the mission will test us

16:57.099 --> 16:58.350
in ways we can't imagine?

16:58.976 --> 17:01.638
Well, we could get
incinerated during the flight.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.971
Or we could get trapped
outside the Titan habitat
and be asphyxiated

17:05.107 --> 17:06.313
in the toxic atmosphere.

17:06.734 --> 17:09.726
Well, you'd probably
be frozen solid first or...

17:12.490 --> 17:13.946
Maybe she just
meant it metaphorically.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.610
Yeah, maybe.

17:19.497 --> 17:20.612
What was that for?

17:22.083 --> 17:23.493
Just a little taste
of Titan.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.581
JO: This is the
last one, right?

17:32.718 --> 17:34.219
(LAUGHS)
You hate this stuff.

17:34.679 --> 17:36.510
Four down,
three to go.

17:37.682 --> 17:40.139
So where's Allison
on the whole
moving in thing?

17:40.977 --> 17:42.638
Oh, she's still
thinking about it.

17:42.853 --> 17:47.472
Oh, well, no offense, Carter,
but you haven't exactly had
a lot of luck in that area.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.769
Wow, thanks for the support.
That's nice.
(LAUGHS)

17:49.902 --> 17:51.984
But you know
I think that you do
have it in you.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.853
And I want you
to be happy.

17:54.031 --> 17:55.020
Thanks.

17:55.283 --> 17:56.739
You know, I'm going to
miss you around the house.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.446
Miss you, too.

18:01.289 --> 18:04.281
Um, so how are you with
the whole Zane leaving?

18:04.417 --> 18:05.998
(GROANS)
Oh, regrets?

18:06.127 --> 18:11.793
Well, some.
But I just feel like there's
something else for me.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.539
| just have to find it.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.084
There is.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.755
Two more rods.
Yes.

18:20.891 --> 18:21.926
Let's go.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.141
SENATOR WEN: Ah, Dr. Deacon.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.694
I can't tell you how
sorry I am that you're
not on this mission.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.821
Well, you know,
everybody's on this mission,

18:37.950 --> 18:40.532
just not everybody's
going to Titan.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.860
FTL reactor Cell 1?

18:43.331 --> 18:45.947
100%, fluctuation nominal.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.327
Cell 2?

18:47.835 --> 18:49.871
81%. Fluctuation...

18:50.004 --> 18:53.838
81%? See? You've got
a minor power drain.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.502
A drain? From what?

18:55.635 --> 18:57.500
Uh, not sure, Senator.
Just discovered it.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.006
But there is
enough power to launch?

19:00.139 --> 19:02.755
Yes. The fluctuation
is less than a gigawatt,

19:02.892 --> 19:05.850
but we will have to hold
the countdown clock
to T minus 5 hours

19:05.978 --> 19:07.639
and 13 minutes, mark.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.766
But you said there was
enough power to launch.

19:09.899 --> 19:12.766
We're not going
to proceed until we've
repaired the power drain.

19:13.861 --> 19:14.941
Of course.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.857
The safety of the
crew comes first.

19:18.032 --> 19:20.739
But this launch has
to happen, Dr. Deacon.

19:21.452 --> 19:24.944
The future of Eureka
depends on it,
so figure it out.

19:25.790 --> 19:26.950
Figure it out?

19:30.211 --> 19:33.954
Start diagnostics.
Reactor team,
you're with me.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.329
MAN: Yes, sir.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.096
(GROANING)

19:44.100 --> 19:45.089
(LAUGHS)

19:46.310 --> 19:48.926
Ooh, be sure to hand
out the powdered broccoli.

19:49.063 --> 19:50.553
JO: That was
the last one.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.726
All the energy rods
have been shut off.

19:52.858 --> 19:56.476
That's too bad. I was sort of
looking fonNard to tromping
through another sheep pasture.

19:56.612 --> 19:59.945
(LAUGHS) Dr. Plotkin stuck
his rods in some odd places.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.488
(LAUGHING)

20:01.617 --> 20:02.777
What are you? 12?
What are you? 12?

20:02.910 --> 20:04.366
You're 12.
Uh, yeah.

20:04.495 --> 20:05.905
A taste of Titan
in honor of the launch.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.654
Nothing but the most
advanced culinary techniques.

20:08.874 --> 20:12.867
Spherified tomato soup,
cryo-desiccated grilled
cheese sandwiches...

20:13.003 --> 20:14.459
Just the way Poppy
used to make them.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.044
Thanks, Vince, I think
we were more hoping

20:16.173 --> 20:17.834
for lunch than
a chemistry lesson.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.548
Cooking is chemistry,
Shenﬁ.

20:20.428 --> 20:23.090
Ooh, what about a burger
with nitrogen bacon foam?

20:23.264 --> 20:24.549
Ooh, burger sounds good.

20:26.976 --> 20:27.965
Did...

20:32.940 --> 20:34.601
(ALL SCREAMING)
All right, everybody out!

20:34.775 --> 20:36.231
Get out! Get out!
People, come on!

20:36.402 --> 20:37.938
JO: Go! Go!
CARTER: Come on!
Go! Go!

20:39.321 --> 20:40.310
CARTER: Come on!

20:42.116 --> 20:43.276
Who's back there?

20:43.659 --> 20:44.648
(MAN YELLING)

20:48.456 --> 20:49.445
Carter!

20:54.879 --> 20:57.086
Well, that sucks.

21:02.970 --> 21:06.588
It was like... It was like
a spinning hole and then
everything went red.

21:06.724 --> 21:09.636
And then the cafe just
collapsed and disappeared.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.555
You saw a naked singularity.

21:11.812 --> 21:12.892
No, that I would
have noticed.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.478
That would be
a black hole.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.814
Technically speaking,
you can't see black holes.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.102
No light reflects off of it.

21:18.235 --> 21:21.398
And the red world was the
result of it absorbing most
of the color spectrum.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.897
Yeah, but sometimes if it's
the right size, you can see
a naked singularity around...

21:25.618 --> 21:26.903
You're right.
Forget it.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.947
The point is
black holes in Eureka, bad.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.327
See? That I get.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.912
But a collapsing
black hole,

21:32.041 --> 21:35.124
that might explain
the photon burst that
sliced the limo.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.868
And the spaghettification
of Taggart's truck. Real term.

21:38.005 --> 21:41.168
But black holes
don'tjust pop up
out of nowhere.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.961
Well, no, actually,
they pop up all the time.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.503
It's just that
they're either too small

21:44.637 --> 21:46.719
or they dissipate
too quickly for
anybody to notice them.

21:47.097 --> 21:51.807
Okay. So first my PDA
has a camera and now
black holes are everywhere?

21:51.936 --> 21:53.642
People need to
know these things!

21:53.813 --> 21:57.271
But something is causing the
black holes to stabilize long
enough to do major damage.

21:57.399 --> 21:58.809
Well, it can't be
Plotkin's rods.

21:58.943 --> 22:00.479
I mean, we turned them off
before the cafe was hit.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.101
Yeah, but they're
forming randomly now.

22:02.238 --> 22:04.069
There's some other
energy source feeding them.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.314
The power drain in
the FTL ion reactor.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.236
Oh, that's the battery.
Got that.

22:08.369 --> 22:09.700
Uh, we had a leak
in the containment.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.571
Now the escaped ionic
energy could have charged
the atmosphere around Eureka

22:12.706 --> 22:16.119
enough to allow Plotkin's
array to stabilize
the black holes.

22:16.293 --> 22:17.999
The fuse is now lit.

22:18.504 --> 22:19.994
Maybe you should think
about fixing that leak.

22:20.130 --> 22:22.041
No, we did, but if
the atmosphere is charged,

22:22.174 --> 22:23.880
it takes hours
before it dissipates.

22:24.009 --> 22:27.297
Until then, more
black holes that could
spaghettify Eureka.

22:28.222 --> 22:30.133
Plotkin's rods still
attract them, right?

22:30.266 --> 22:32.097
Maybe we can lead
them out of town.

22:32.434 --> 22:34.174
Good. Someplace remote.

22:34.311 --> 22:35.687
We can place the rods
around the lake.

22:35.813 --> 22:36.848
That way we can
pen in the black holes

22:36.981 --> 22:39.723
long enough for them
to dissipate harmlessly
and on their own...

22:40.359 --> 22:42.145
Don't say "theoretically."

22:43.195 --> 22:44.401
Theoretically.

22:45.573 --> 22:49.657
G.D. COMPUTER: Countdown
holding at T minus 5 hours,
13 minutes, 59 seconds.

22:50.244 --> 22:51.199
Zane.

22:51.328 --> 22:52.317
a??? 63-;
Fig—big
:i iii-J 3,3.

22:52.454 --> 22:53.443
Where you been all day?

22:53.581 --> 22:56.118
Oh, you know, dealing
with the usual stuff.

22:56.292 --> 22:57.998
(LAUGHS) That bad, huh?

22:58.335 --> 23:02.499
Mmm. Yeah.
Look, I have to go.

23:02.798 --> 23:06.586
But I just... I wanted
to make sure that I caught
you before the big launch.

23:07.845 --> 23:08.925
You sure you don't
want to come along?

23:09.054 --> 23:12.387
I mean, we can probably
share my bio-pod.

23:12.975 --> 23:13.964
Mmm.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.055
It's very tempting.

23:17.187 --> 23:18.176
Mmm.

23:19.690 --> 23:22.898
But I have some
other stuff that
I need to do.

23:31.994 --> 23:33.154
I'll be thinking about you.

23:33.746 --> 23:39.036
Hmm. I'm sure you
say that to all your
alternate-timeline hookups.

23:41.295 --> 23:42.410
No.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.000
You were never a hookup.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.840
Oh.

23:59.355 --> 24:00.515
I gotta go.

24:00.773 --> 24:01.933
Yeah.

24:04.526 --> 24:05.732
Be safe up there.

24:06.779 --> 24:07.859
|wi||.

24:17.998 --> 24:18.987
Take care, JoJo.

24:22.336 --> 24:26.500
Wait! It's not going
to create one of
those photon bursts

24:26.632 --> 24:29.294
like the thing that sliced
through Faux-Bama's car?

24:29.635 --> 24:30.841
You can unclench, man.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.052
Our rods will absorb
any gamma rays.

24:34.390 --> 24:35.630
It's kind of
what they do.

24:35.808 --> 24:36.763
Right.

24:38.644 --> 24:39.804
Hit it.
All right.

24:40.229 --> 24:41.969
(RUMBLING)

24:49.279 --> 24:50.985
Holly!
Oh.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.819
I need to say something
before we launch.

24:55.244 --> 24:58.111
Oh. Do you want
to go ahead and do
it now, just in case?

24:59.289 --> 25:02.656
I want to tell you
I love you.

25:04.378 --> 25:05.493
Just in case.

25:05.629 --> 25:09.588
Oh, wow,
that's really...

25:11.969 --> 25:13.084
(SIGHS) Wow.

25:14.972 --> 25:18.089
"Good" wow?
Or "how do I tell this
joker to back off" wow?

25:20.894 --> 25:22.430
"How did I get
so lucky" wow.

25:44.084 --> 25:45.039
Whoo!

25:45.377 --> 25:46.583
(BOTH GASPING)

25:46.712 --> 25:49.044
Well, maybe our
second time can
be on actual Titan?

25:49.214 --> 25:50.203
Oh, yeah.

25:52.009 --> 25:53.670
Maybe our third.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.680
PLOTKIN: This really
makes you appreciate
how much

26:00.809 --> 26:03.972
amazing stuff is out there
in the universe that we
just never get to see.

26:04.772 --> 26:07.138
I'm going to go with
"makes you terrified."

26:07.274 --> 26:09.686
Huh. That's
kind of interesting.

26:11.987 --> 26:14.694
Shouldn't the little black
dots be blinking out of
existence right about now?

26:15.199 --> 26:16.188
Theoretically.

26:16.658 --> 26:19.900
Yeah, they seem more
interested in joining
together as one.

26:20.454 --> 26:21.489
CARTER: Yeah.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.408
Yeah, one big one.

26:32.716 --> 26:35.924
Do you think
we should, uh,

26:37.846 --> 26:38.961
run?
Yeah!

26:48.190 --> 26:50.897
All right, hold on. Okay.

26:51.902 --> 26:53.438
CARTER: Nope. No. No.

26:56.448 --> 26:57.528
Right there.

26:57.658 --> 27:00.024
My team's cordoned
off the area around
the black hole.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.866
Secure perimeter
is 2 kilometers.

27:01.995 --> 27:03.860
For the moment,
but it's still growing.

27:03.997 --> 27:06.989
Yeah, but the good news is
my arrays should keep it
focused over the lake.

27:07.126 --> 27:11.415
And the bad news
is no boating on
Lake Archimedes?

27:11.547 --> 27:12.957
More like no more Eureka.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.797
If we wait for
a black hole this size
to dissipate on its own,

27:15.926 --> 27:18.713
it will release
a catastrophic
gamma ray burst.

27:18.846 --> 27:21.383
Yeah, and that's like
annihilation at the
molecular level,

27:21.515 --> 27:22.550
which is a total bummer.

27:22.683 --> 27:25.390
Can we make it dissipate?
Like a smaller boom?

27:25.519 --> 27:28.352
The heart of a black hole
is incredibly dense matter.

27:28.522 --> 27:31.855
To force one to dissipate,
we would have to simulate
what happens in a hypernova,

27:31.984 --> 27:34.976
maybe with a
gamma ray laser
or an antimatter bomb.

27:35.445 --> 27:36.821
Anti matter,
we have that.

27:36.947 --> 27:40.235
(STAMMERING)
The... Grandma had...

27:40.367 --> 27:42.699
The penny trap
at the floating bank.

27:42.828 --> 27:43.863
Penning trap.
Yes!

27:43.996 --> 27:45.156
We've got it here
in secure containment.

27:45.289 --> 27:47.371
Yeah, so we grab that,
we throw it in the
hole and day saved.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.785
In theory. The problem
is the delivery system.

27:49.918 --> 27:53.285
Any conventional bomb
casing will spaghettify
and detonate too soon.

27:53.422 --> 27:54.411
Hmm.

27:56.300 --> 27:57.335
Hmm.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.886
If only we knew

28:00.012 --> 28:04.096
some sort of
unconventional bomb maker.

28:04.850 --> 28:07.091
Oh, no, man, no.
I don't roll that
way anymore.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.684
I don't...
I don't do bombs.

28:13.066 --> 28:15.022
Anymore. I can't.

28:15.652 --> 28:16.687
You will.

28:18.989 --> 28:21.275
Oh, I feel so dirty.
You'll live.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.112
All right, now this
is a high-tensile
torpedo shell.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.986
I developed it to
withstand the pressures
of deep-sea deployment.

28:27.331 --> 28:28.946
Or in this case,
spaghettification.

28:29.333 --> 28:30.789
All right,
where's the antimatter?

28:30.918 --> 28:32.829
Heads up.
Oh, good timing.
Bullet's ready.

28:32.961 --> 28:33.825
All right.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.577
How do we fire it?
A projectile launch might

28:35.714 --> 28:36.829
rupture the
containment shield.

28:36.965 --> 28:37.954
Yeah.

28:38.091 --> 28:40.958
That's why it's going to
have to be hand-delivered.

28:41.261 --> 28:42.967
And I'm the delivery boy.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.170
So how close
do we have to get it?

28:45.307 --> 28:48.174
(SIGHS) Gauging a minimum
safe distance is impossible.

28:48.310 --> 28:51.268
We just need you
to get the bomb to
the event horizon intact.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.435
So I'm winging it?

28:52.564 --> 28:53.849
Pretty much.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.062
(GROANS)

28:57.611 --> 28:59.943
Better you than me.
You're good to go.

29:01.114 --> 29:03.730
All right, then.
Off to storm
the black hole.

29:03.867 --> 29:07.860
Just don't get sucked in.
I may need help with
the move, if I say yes.

29:07.996 --> 29:08.826
I love you.

29:08.956 --> 29:10.036
I love you, too.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.407
Just feel the
energy, Sheriff.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.662
Shut up.

29:14.795 --> 29:15.784
Be careful.
PLOTKIN: All right.

29:16.630 --> 29:17.585
Get your own girlfriend.

29:17.714 --> 29:20.626
I have a girlfriend.
Her name is science.

29:32.145 --> 29:33.555
This is going to suck!

29:36.775 --> 29:38.060
I'm here!

29:40.237 --> 29:41.192

29:50.831 --> 29:52.867

the tidal pull now!

29:53.375 --> 29:55.832
Yeah! I'm feeling it!

29:57.254 --> 29:58.790
Am I close enough?

ALLISON: Carter,
deliver the missile...
Allison?

30:02.551 --> 30:03.666

30:04.303 --> 30:05.418

We lost him.

All those months of

have to take a moment.

31:45.821 --> 31:47.027
I mean, you're
going to Titan.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.315
Yes, we are.

31:48.990 --> 31:51.857
We're about to get
zapped into outer space.
How are you two so calm?

31:52.786 --> 31:54.242
One small step for man.

31:57.499 --> 32:00.866
One giant leap for Fargo.
Nice one, buddy.

32:07.843 --> 32:08.958
Last chance, people.

32:09.678 --> 32:12.090
I'm ready to jump in.
It's not too late to
change your minds.

32:12.722 --> 32:14.053
Too late for you,

32:14.224 --> 32:16.010
Must be tough
not being a pioneer.

32:17.853 --> 32:18.933
You have no idea.

32:22.566 --> 32:23.555
(CLEARS THROAT)

32:23.733 --> 32:27.897
Hey, Isaac, you are
a part of the mission.

32:28.071 --> 32:30.027
Your stasis gel makes
all the difference.

32:32.617 --> 32:33.732
Thanks, Doug.

Try not to die up there.

Hey.

32:47.424 --> 32:48.584
Hey.

32:48.717 --> 32:51.754
So about time
for bon voyage, huh?

32:51.887 --> 32:54.378
Yes, thanks to you
saving the day again.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.095
I think we have to
have a "we" in there
somewhere.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.931
We make a pretty
good team, don't we?

32:59.394 --> 33:00.509
Yes, we do.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.850
But if you're thinking
about going after any
more naked singularities,

33:03.982 --> 33:05.597
I think I'm going
to have to pass.

33:05.734 --> 33:07.895
Not the kind of naked
I was thinking of.

33:08.028 --> 33:10.565
Oh.
Definitely not singular.

33:10.697 --> 33:11.686
Jack,

33:12.866 --> 33:15.448
I think that we should
move in together.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.115
You want to move in?

33:20.790 --> 33:21.996

Are you sure?

33:22.626 --> 33:27.746
We will deal with that later.
Right now I'm going to get
the crew settled on board.

So right now would
be a good time for you
to say your goodbyes.

spoken with Jo?

I was trying to
write you a note.

I was always better
with weapons than words.

34:11.883 --> 34:14.670
Just going to leave
without saying goodbye?

I don't do goodbyes.

Jo,

34:22.978 --> 34:23.967
I need you.

34:29.192 --> 34:31.103
You're part of the reason
I'm going, Carter.

34:31.945 --> 34:33.185
I'm... What?

34:33.989 --> 34:36.901
(SIGHS) When you
first came to Eureka,

34:37.033 --> 34:40.571
you were smug
and self-centered.

34:40.704 --> 34:43.946
And you were
a really crappy boss.

34:44.207 --> 34:46.414
Wow, you really are
bad at goodbyes.

34:50.005 --> 34:53.668
But you found your place here,
and you made it a home

34:54.134 --> 34:56.967
and now you're making
this family and...

34:58.888 --> 35:01.300
And I consider you
a part of my family.

35:03.018 --> 35:03.973
Me, too.

35:05.895 --> 35:08.762
But these last few months
have made me realize
that everything I do

35:09.691 --> 35:12.023
is to prove myself
to someone else.

35:13.069 --> 35:17.233
My father, my brothers,
my boyfriends

35:19.242 --> 35:20.231
and you.

35:22.871 --> 35:25.283
I need to figure out
what I want.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.705
You can't figure
that out from here?

35:35.091 --> 35:37.503
I don't think so.
Not yet.

35:39.179 --> 35:40.294
I hope you do.

35:43.725 --> 35:47.559
And, uh,
I hope you come back.

Me, too.

36:11.544 --> 36:12.875
I'll be seeing you, Carter.

36:27.310 --> 36:28.299
Okay.

36:46.871 --> 36:51.661
She packed my bags
last night pre-flight

36:51.876 --> 36:53.161
Yes, she did

36:58.216 --> 36:59.205
You all right?

37:00.343 --> 37:01.753
And I'm going to be high...

37:01.886 --> 37:04.719
I'm going to be watching
over you every second.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.175
You better be.

37:11.771 --> 37:12.806
(SIGHS)

37:13.857 --> 37:17.850
I miss the Earth so much
I miss my wife

37:19.529 --> 37:20.439
All right?

37:20.572 --> 37:23.860
Gets so lonely out in space

37:26.578 --> 37:31.038
On such a timeless flight

37:31.875 --> 37:34.958
As this is

37:39.883 --> 37:43.000
And I think it's gonna
be a long, long time

37:43.386 --> 37:46.469
Till touch down brings
me 'round again to find

37:46.723 --> 37:51.592
I'm not the man they think
I am at home, no, no, no

37:52.020 --> 37:54.853
I'm a rocket man

37:55.648 --> 37:57.104
Rocket man...

37:57.233 --> 38:01.226
Walkabout.
Safe travels, Jo.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.902
I think it's gonna
be a long, long time

38:10.330 --> 38:13.948
I think it's gonna
be a long, long time

38:15.877 --> 38:18.289
So this is it.
A journey for the ages.

38:18.421 --> 38:19.456
Are you ready?

38:21.800 --> 38:25.384
Hold the fort, but
don't get too comfortable.
I am coming back.

38:25.845 --> 38:27.176
I'm counting on that.

38:37.607 --> 38:39.347
Rocket man

38:40.151 --> 38:45.020
Vital system checks undenNay.
Initiate activation protocols.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.109
Ah, Sheriff Carter,
you're just in time.

38:47.242 --> 38:49.278
Yeah. I had some
goodbyes to say.

38:49.536 --> 38:51.151
Oh, well, you wouldn't
want to miss this.

38:51.287 --> 38:52.902
It's an historic
moment for Eureka.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.030
All right, can I have
everyone's attention?

38:57.544 --> 39:00.206
When Kennedy announced
that we would go to the moon,

39:01.047 --> 39:05.757
he said it was the
greatest adventure on
which man has ever embarked,

39:06.052 --> 39:07.758
but it's got to be
more than the adventure.

39:07.887 --> 39:09.718
It's... It's who we are.

39:09.848 --> 39:13.591
Human beings, explorers,
learning more about
the universe that we live in,

39:13.726 --> 39:16.388
to know more about
our place in it.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.891
So good luck to us.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.355
And Godspeed.

39:21.651 --> 39:23.187
I'm done.
Get back to work.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.093
Dr. Deacon,
you need to look at that.

39:54.642 --> 39:55.802
CARTER: Should that
be speeding up?

39:55.935 --> 39:57.141
Absolutely not.

39:59.022 --> 40:00.853
Their destination
coordinates are changing.

40:01.482 --> 40:02.471
How?

40:02.609 --> 40:05.271
Some kind of root line
navigational recode.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.860
Pull "B" firewall and
get me priority access.

40:09.324 --> 40:10.279
No response.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.649
Pull all the damn firewalls
and get me into that system!

40:13.870 --> 40:14.985
CARTER: What's
going on, Henry?

40:15.997 --> 40:17.908
What's happening, Doctor?
I'm locked out
of the system.

40:18.041 --> 40:20.874
The ship is
about to launch
and I can't stop it.

40:23.212 --> 40:24.748
Henry? What's happening?

40:24.881 --> 40:25.791
(BEEPING)

40:25.924 --> 40:27.084
What the hell is going on?

40:27.216 --> 40:28.672
None of the computers
are responding.

40:28.801 --> 40:30.712
SENATOR WEN: There must be
a security override.

40:30.845 --> 40:32.710
The system is
actively rejecting it.

40:32.847 --> 40:34.132
That's not
a computer crash.

40:36.017 --> 40:37.348
No. It isn't.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.601
What do you mean?
Someone else is
controlling this launch.

40:43.858 --> 40:44.847
What?

40:53.618 --> 40:55.324
Mission control,
can you hear me?

40:55.870 --> 40:57.326
Allison, can you hear me?

40:57.455 --> 40:58.911
Allison, can you hear me?

40:59.040 --> 41:00.200
We've got to get
them out of there.

41:00.333 --> 41:03.541
Team leaders, enter
your abort codes. Now!

41:03.670 --> 41:05.752
We're locked out, sir,
and the countdown
is still accelerating.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.165
How is that possible?

41:07.298 --> 41:08.333
HENRY: I don't know.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.297
What happens
to Dr. Blake if
the ship launches?

41:10.426 --> 41:12.587
Without the bio-pod
to protect her from
gravitational stresses,

41:12.720 --> 41:14.335
the only chance she has
is the jump seat.

41:14.472 --> 41:15.552
Well, I'm getting
her out of there.

41:15.682 --> 41:18.139
Jack, you can't go out there!
The FTL is about
to reach full power.

41:18.267 --> 41:19.427
Then I'm going
to stop it before it does.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.300
I can't let you do that!
It's too dangerous!

41:21.437 --> 41:22.517
Oh, fire me!

41:24.774 --> 41:26.514
Launch sequence initiating.

41:29.070 --> 41:30.059
Oh, my God!

41:38.538 --> 41:39.948
ASTRAEUS COMPUTER:
Abort code denied.

41:45.753 --> 41:46.868
Jack!

41:52.093 --> 41:53.082
Jack,no!

41:53.845 --> 41:54.880
What are you doing?

41:56.347 --> 41:57.723
What happens
if he shoots the reactor?

41:57.849 --> 41:59.840
We won't launch, because
none of us will be here.

42:11.612 --> 42:12.863
ASTRAEUS COMPUTER:
Command not accepted.

42:15.825 --> 42:16.814
That might work.

42:16.951 --> 42:18.031
What? Beating on it?

42:18.161 --> 42:20.743
If he breaches the cooling
chambers, the core centers
will shut down

42:20.872 --> 42:22.453
to keep the reactor
from overheating.

42:22.790 --> 42:24.200
Come on.
Come on, Jack. Come on.

42:24.333 --> 42:25.584
(GRUNTING)

42:25.710 --> 42:28.326
G.D. COMPUTER: Warning,
reactor core overheating.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.830
The temperature is reaching
critical. It's working.
Come on. Let's go!

42:35.845 --> 42:38.552
G.D. COMPUTER:
Reactor core
auto-shutdown commencing.

42:42.185 --> 42:44.221
ASTRAEUS COMPUTER:
Final launch command
initiated.

42:44.353 --> 42:45.433
(GASPING)

43:02.371 --> 43:03.872
Does anyone have
a reading on the ship?

43:04.290 --> 43:06.121
Life status?
Coordinates? Anything?

43:12.840 --> 43:14.046
Where'd they go?
