11:45.663 --> 11:48.999
And yet, as I said to Miss Dawson, uh,

11:49.083 --> 11:53.796
acting is about putting the self aside
in service of the text.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.590
The text is feral, and I'm feral.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.552

it's a problem.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.601

12:07.852 --> 12:10.896

12:31.751 --> 12:34.920

[grunts softly]

12:37.173 --> 12:40.885

12:40.968 --> 12:44.388
No, please. It's two more months.
Show'll be over.

12:45.055 --> 12:47.558
I'll see a doctor when I get back to LA.
Okay?

12:49.602 --> 12:51.020

-Come here.

12:51.103 --> 12:54.064

-I'm good!

12:56.859 --> 12:59.069
Thanks again for seeing us
on such short notice.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.572

kick their asses for a change.

It's the longest-running show
at the Fan-Tan.

13:11.457 --> 13:15.127
Oh, um, I'm not actually
in the show anymore. I had a baby.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.963
-Congratulations!
-Yeah, Brandon.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.840
He's gonna be 15 months next week.

13:19.924 --> 13:23.552
-Oh, so you took time off.
-Well, I danced up until four months.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.513
I was keeping everything really tight,
and I wasn't showing

13:25.596 --> 13:29.099
and I thought I had another month in me,
but one day, I came off stage and just...

13:29.183 --> 13:31.685
Whoo! [laughs]

13:31.769 --> 13:34.855

13:51.664 --> 13:53.791
So when are they gonna put you back
in the show?

13:53.874 --> 13:55.876
They audition girls every six months.

13:56.001 --> 13:59.213
So, last time, they said I wasn't ready.

14:00.297 --> 14:03.926
But, uh, the next one's
in just another couple months, so...

You look wonderful.
Have you been practicing?

14:20.150 --> 14:22.319
-Yeah!
-[Denise] Have you been practicing?

14:22.403 --> 14:25.531
All right, let's come over here,
and let's talk about our positions.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.992

Look, I was just hoping
to work up a sweat, that's all.

all right, big guy?
