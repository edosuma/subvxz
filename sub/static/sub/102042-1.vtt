M_I_SForEver

00:10.762 --> 00:15.330
Scientists
called it, S-H-V-I-D-1.

00:15.332 --> 00:17.199
SHVID-1.

00:17.201 --> 00:19.203
Most people called it, death.

00:20.672 --> 00:25.042
A worldwide pandemic disease
of cataclysmic proportions.

00:26.511 --> 00:29.679
A simple shark bite off the
Australian beach started it.

00:29.681 --> 00:32.615
Then it spread exponentially.

00:32.616 --> 00:36.619
Beaches were closed at
first and few listened.

00:36.621 --> 00:38.222
More shark attacks occurred.

00:39.457 --> 00:41.958
By the time the tourist
industry was closed down

00:41.960 --> 00:43.225
it was too late.

00:43.227 --> 00:45.928
100,000 people were infected.

00:45.930 --> 00:49.130
Then half a million,
then 2 million.

00:49.132 --> 00:50.334
Then we stopped counting.

00:51.469 --> 00:53.636
Martial law was
declared after looting

00:53.638 --> 00:56.104
and panic buying
crippled cities.

00:56.106 --> 00:58.406
People were forced to
stay in their homes

00:58.408 --> 01:00.208
to die while the
governments of the world

01:00.210 --> 01:02.444
scrambled to find a cure.

01:02.446 --> 01:04.312
That's how we ended up here.

01:04.313 --> 01:08.083
There are five of us in
this oceanic research lab

01:08.085 --> 01:10.185
converted almost overnight

01:10.187 --> 01:13.255
into a top secret facility
who has been tasked

01:13.257 --> 01:15.725
with finding a cure
to this outbreak.

01:15.727 --> 01:18.260
Find it at all costs.

01:18.262 --> 01:20.496
As hell breaks loose
on the surface.

01:20.498 --> 01:25.300
We are 800 meters below the
ocean searching for answers.

01:26.538 --> 01:29.337
I'm Kristi Parks,
a shark expert.

01:29.339 --> 01:32.107
I have contained several
sharks who transferred

01:32.109 --> 01:34.342
the deadly virus
through their bites

01:34.344 --> 01:36.779
and several unaffected sharks.

01:36.781 --> 01:40.348
The answer lies in one
of them or all of them,

01:40.350 --> 01:42.018
or none of them.

01:42.020 --> 01:45.755
Research so far creates
more questions than answers.

01:45.757 --> 01:46.925
Time is running out.

01:48.158 --> 01:51.928
Gregory McLandon is our
lead disease specialist.

01:51.930 --> 01:54.764
He works tirelessly
between his serum tests

01:54.766 --> 01:57.934
and constant video conferences
with Shannon Muldoon,

01:57.936 --> 02:00.503
our top side disease
control agent.

02:00.505 --> 02:04.339
She feeds us bits and pieces
of the real situation.

02:04.341 --> 02:06.844
And I wonder what her
motives and real purpose is.

02:08.012 --> 02:10.345
Gregory says he's
close to a cure,

02:10.347 --> 02:13.081
but he's been saying
that for months.

02:13.083 --> 02:15.851
Ann Satcher works
closely with Gregory.

02:15.853 --> 02:19.220
She's top of her field in
Marine studies and plant life.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.857
She was the first one
chosen for the assignment.

02:21.859 --> 02:23.325
Handpicked by Muldoon.

02:23.327 --> 02:26.161
Rumor has it she was
an ex lover of hers,

02:26.163 --> 02:28.965
but no one cares
enough to even ask.

02:28.967 --> 02:30.700
We're all too busy
to really care,

02:30.702 --> 02:33.201
to know one's personal life.

02:33.203 --> 02:35.605
Rickter D'Amato
designed and built

02:35.607 --> 02:37.773
this underwater maze years ago,

02:37.775 --> 02:40.442
when it was a weapons test site.

02:40.444 --> 02:44.212
He was instrumental in its
overhaul to a research lab

02:44.214 --> 02:46.616
and his job is to keep us alive

02:46.618 --> 02:49.552
so the deep abyss doesn't
come crashing onto us

02:49.554 --> 02:52.153
and send us to a watery grave.

02:52.155 --> 02:54.356
Duke Larson is our security.

02:54.358 --> 02:56.058
If you can call it that.

02:56.060 --> 02:58.628
I wonder why we need
a soldier down here.

02:58.630 --> 03:00.563
What's he protecting us from?

03:00.565 --> 03:02.865
Is he here to break
up a squabble?

03:02.867 --> 03:05.133
He takes his job too seriously.

03:05.135 --> 03:07.135
It makes me nervous.

03:07.137 --> 03:10.438
One way or another, the
future depends on us.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.274
Muldoon tells us that
in every meeting.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.878
Words I never thought I'd hear.

04:45.335 --> 04:49.270
Sickness topside
platform 10 degrees starboard.

04:49.272 --> 04:52.608
Delivery of specimens, prepped
and ready for drop-off.

05:27.645 --> 05:29.612
Another batch of stiffs?

05:29.614 --> 05:31.682
This might be the
last one for awhile.

05:34.051 --> 05:37.686
So tell me what's
it like up there?

05:37.688 --> 05:41.624
Mr. be Thankful
you're down here.

05:45.163 --> 05:45.961
See you later.

05:45.963 --> 05:46.929
Have a good one.

06:22.266 --> 06:23.465
You startled me.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.934
I'm sorry.

06:24.936 --> 06:27.837
I'm heading for another
fireside chat with Maldoon.

06:27.839 --> 06:29.238
Are you okay?

06:29.240 --> 06:30.371
You seem jumpy.

06:30.373 --> 06:31.874
It's the sharks.

06:31.876 --> 06:32.977
Their behavior.

06:34.078 --> 06:35.211
What about it?

06:35.213 --> 06:37.546
Seem more
aggressive than usual.

06:37.548 --> 06:40.716
I think something's disrupting
their behavior patterns.

06:40.718 --> 06:42.151
I wouldn't take it personally.

06:42.153 --> 06:44.419
We're all a little
on edge and newsflash

06:44.421 --> 06:46.455
they are aggressive animals.

06:46.457 --> 06:47.556
Not with me.

06:47.558 --> 06:49.291
At least they haven't been.

06:49.293 --> 06:50.759
When you're done
with your samples,

06:50.761 --> 06:53.829
we'll set them free and we'll
get you some fresh pupils.

06:53.831 --> 06:55.664
Anything to add to my report?

06:55.666 --> 06:58.968
I have to break down the virus

06:58.970 --> 07:00.636
from the different species

07:00.638 --> 07:03.272
and cross examine it
with Ann's findings.

07:03.274 --> 07:05.710
We've got a corpse from
top side for her today.

07:07.111 --> 07:10.246
Maybe it'll yield some clues
as to how one shark bite

07:10.248 --> 07:12.114
can take down the world.

07:12.116 --> 07:15.851
Last two bodies didn't
show signs of pathogens.

07:15.853 --> 07:17.418
And so, I don't know.

07:17.420 --> 07:20.157
I'm just wondering
if it's hopeless.

07:21.325 --> 07:22.591
Don't give up.

07:22.593 --> 07:23.492
Your close.

08:02.466 --> 08:03.899
Sea water.

08:33.931 --> 08:34.863
Yes, Duke.

08:34.865 --> 08:36.198
What is it?

08:36.200 --> 08:37.433
Fresh meat.

08:37.434 --> 08:38.635
Brand new delivery.

08:44.442 --> 08:45.874
All right, let's
get it on the table.

08:59.423 --> 09:00.825
Thanks.
That'll be all.

09:02.860 --> 09:04.827
You know, your
colder than those fish

09:04.829 --> 09:06.465
that Dr. Kristi works with.

09:07.631 --> 09:08.897
We have a job to do.

09:08.899 --> 09:10.699
We don't have any time
for any acquaintances

09:10.701 --> 09:12.370
or anything like that.

09:13.337 --> 09:14.737
That does it matter.

09:14.739 --> 09:17.673
The whole world up top
is going to shit anyway.

09:17.675 --> 09:21.545
We're all just down here,
jerking off wasting our time.

09:22.980 --> 09:27.449
I'm better spent enjoying a
little bit we might have left.

09:27.452 --> 09:29.018
You disgust me.

09:29.020 --> 09:30.953
Now go find some other
damsel in distress

09:30.955 --> 09:32.757
who might need your protection.

09:33.791 --> 09:36.959
Yeah, well have fun, bitch.

10:01.118 --> 10:02.452
Oh, interesting.

10:02.454 --> 10:03.986
This blood cells show lessening

10:03.988 --> 10:05.524
signs of the strain.

10:06.458 --> 10:07.291
Decrease.

10:15.900 --> 10:16.999
Oh damn.

10:17.001 --> 10:19.068
We may be onto something.

10:19.070 --> 10:22.104
The normal pathogen is
attacking the SHVID-1.

10:35.686 --> 10:40.658
Wonder what species of shark
inflicted these wounds.

10:47.298 --> 10:49.466
Hey Kristi, can you
come up to the lab?

10:49.468 --> 10:51.202
I need your opinion
on something.

10:52.169 --> 10:52.970
Thanks.

10:58.809 --> 11:00.342
Need more than that. Gregory.

11:00.344 --> 11:02.479
We need results and
we need them fast.

11:02.481 --> 11:04.446
The virus is spreading rapidly.

11:04.448 --> 11:06.448
A few shark attacks
have brought us to this.

11:06.451 --> 11:07.649
Muldoon?

11:07.651 --> 11:08.951
You know, you can
call me Shannon.

11:08.953 --> 11:11.188
At least you did
when you seduced me.

11:12.423 --> 11:13.556
Seduced?

11:13.558 --> 11:14.890
I wasn't even trying.

11:14.892 --> 11:16.825
Don't you even remember?

11:16.827 --> 11:18.461
Of course not.

11:18.463 --> 11:20.729
But that's not
a real priority.

11:20.731 --> 11:22.831
I can get you out
of there if you want.

11:22.833 --> 11:24.299
It must be lonely for you

11:24.301 --> 11:27.238
or are the technicians taking
care of everyone's needs.

11:28.439 --> 11:30.607
Now what's that
supposed to mean?

11:30.609 --> 11:32.040
Oh nothing.

11:33.277 --> 11:34.477
The sharks we
have in captivity

11:34.479 --> 11:36.912
aren't giving us
the results we need.

11:36.914 --> 11:38.714
So terminate those specimens.

11:38.716 --> 11:41.518
We don't have time or
resources to deal with things

11:41.520 --> 11:42.818
that aren't giving
us the results.

11:42.820 --> 11:43.622
Understood.

11:44.822 --> 11:47.222
Now that we have that
better out of the way,

11:47.224 --> 11:49.791
why don't we talk about
something entirely personal?

12:11.916 --> 12:13.516
This is not good.

12:17.855 --> 12:20.088
I'm guessing this
bite was caused by mako.

12:20.090 --> 12:22.891
Adult teeth, the patterns
are a dead giveaway.

12:22.893 --> 12:24.359
Why?

12:24.361 --> 12:27.229
The normal pathogens fought
against the viral samples

12:27.231 --> 12:29.364
that I took from this
body for the first time.

12:29.366 --> 12:30.399
Seriously?

12:30.401 --> 12:31.235
Yes. Look.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.140
Oh, that's amazing.

12:38.142 --> 12:39.642
This could be the break we need.

12:39.644 --> 12:42.411
All we need to do now is
test against another species

12:42.413 --> 12:44.480
and see if we get
the same reaction.

12:44.482 --> 12:45.747
But if we don't?

12:45.749 --> 12:47.115
Well then we're
back to square one.

12:47.117 --> 12:48.451
What if we do?

12:48.453 --> 12:51.086
Then we can create
a universal antidote.

12:51.088 --> 12:52.854
It'll cure all known strains.

12:52.856 --> 12:53.658
Yes.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.933
Why do you carry a gun?

13:04.935 --> 13:06.469
If you fired it
inside of Sickness,

13:06.471 --> 13:08.837
you'd bring the
whole ocean down.

13:08.839 --> 13:10.038
Not if you get in the way

13:10.040 --> 13:11.576
and your body slows
down the bullet.

13:12.977 --> 13:15.344
I thought it was an
extension of your member.

13:15.346 --> 13:16.812
Yeah.

13:16.814 --> 13:18.413
You can borrow it after
the meeting if you want to.

13:18.415 --> 13:20.382
Just wipe it off
before you're done.

13:20.384 --> 13:21.783
Pig.

13:21.785 --> 13:23.153
Don't provoke him, Ann.

13:24.021 --> 13:25.655
Okay.

13:25.657 --> 13:28.023
What does everyone have for me?

13:28.025 --> 13:30.292
Muldoon is not happy with
our lack of progress,

13:30.294 --> 13:32.427
and I'm afraid we're
running out of time.

13:32.429 --> 13:33.862
What'd she have to report?

13:33.864 --> 13:35.897
Things are bad top side.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.000
She wants us to destroy
the sharks specimens

13:38.002 --> 13:39.968
and we're to capture another one

13:39.970 --> 13:42.204
to begin new
testing immediately.

13:42.206 --> 13:43.272
Can't destroy them.

13:43.274 --> 13:45.475
They are living creatures.

13:45.477 --> 13:47.142
They're infected animals.

13:47.144 --> 13:49.911
Responsible for the
downfall of mankind.

13:49.913 --> 13:53.718
Stick to your tinker toy and
leave the brainpower to us.

13:54.952 --> 13:56.318
Oh, this tinker
toy as you call it

13:56.320 --> 13:58.220
may not have much time left.

13:58.222 --> 14:00.190
I found signs of string leaking.

14:01.125 --> 14:02.625
The pressure is taking its toll

14:02.627 --> 14:04.960
and without the need of
repairs that I asked for,

14:04.962 --> 14:06.330
it's only a matter of time.

14:07.364 --> 14:08.198
How much time?

14:10.502 --> 14:13.503
I asked you a question,
how much time?

14:13.505 --> 14:16.405
My professional opinion
based on the findings

14:16.407 --> 14:18.140
a few weeks tops.

14:18.142 --> 14:19.043
Just great.

14:20.077 --> 14:21.145
Okay. Thank you.

14:22.413 --> 14:23.847
That's it? Thank you?

14:25.249 --> 14:27.449
We could be crushed any
moment by structure failure

14:27.452 --> 14:28.751
and that's all you have?

14:28.753 --> 14:30.185
Thank you?

14:30.187 --> 14:32.455
Rickter will continue to
assess the situation and we'll...

14:32.457 --> 14:33.690
Bad idea, Gregory.

14:33.692 --> 14:34.356
Will continue
with our mission.

14:34.358 --> 14:35.392
Is that clear?

14:36.994 --> 14:38.193
Good.

14:38.195 --> 14:40.095
We'll destroy the
specimens immediately

14:40.097 --> 14:42.632
and capture another
with the sounding net.

14:42.634 --> 14:44.900
Rickter will continue
to analyze the situation

14:44.902 --> 14:46.070
and keep us informed.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.371
Ladies, what do you have for me?

14:49.373 --> 14:50.807
We may have a breakthrough.

14:50.809 --> 14:53.141
The cadaver's infectious
cells seem to be unable

14:53.143 --> 14:54.878
to fight off the
normal coagulants.

14:56.013 --> 14:58.781
This is the first time
this has occurred.

14:58.783 --> 15:00.750
What do you
think is the reason?

15:00.752 --> 15:02.417
The weakening
strain in the virus.

15:02.419 --> 15:04.853
Maybe the species carrier.

15:04.855 --> 15:07.222
All I know is we have to
continue down this path.

15:07.224 --> 15:08.624
It's all we have.

15:08.626 --> 15:11.527
And it's imperative we
capture a new shark immediately.

15:11.529 --> 15:12.695
This is good news.

15:12.697 --> 15:14.262
Let's beat it
before it beats us.

15:24.676 --> 15:26.108
Here, fishy, fishy, fishy.

16:04.582 --> 16:08.383
Kristi the carcasses of the
sharks will attract others.

16:08.385 --> 16:11.321
Duke assist her with the
capture of a fresh specimen.

16:12.857 --> 16:13.957
Aye, aye, captain.

16:15.693 --> 16:17.225
You heard him doll face.

16:17.227 --> 16:18.895
Let's get ourselves a big one.

16:35.345 --> 16:37.112
Here comes the
infected bustards now.

16:37.114 --> 16:38.614
Get ready to grab them.

16:45.757 --> 16:46.823
You got it. You got it.

16:46.825 --> 16:47.657
Reel it in.

16:59.336 --> 17:02.003
Congratulations you
got a great white.

17:03.273 --> 17:06.007
His face is thin.

17:06.009 --> 17:07.542
Hell.

17:10.647 --> 17:11.848
Hey watch it.

17:11.849 --> 17:14.115
What are you afraid
of a little fishy?

17:14.117 --> 17:14.951
Yeah.

17:14.953 --> 17:16.351
Fuck you.

17:16.353 --> 17:17.720
Not even at the
bottom of this ocean.

17:23.993 --> 17:25.862
You and I are gonna
be good friends.

18:19.717 --> 18:20.550
Are we watching you?

18:20.552 --> 18:21.717
Or you watching us?

18:32.864 --> 18:34.664
When this is all over
I'm going to tear you

18:34.666 --> 18:36.599
to pieces in person.

18:36.601 --> 18:39.367
So it may be sooner
than you think.

18:39.369 --> 18:40.201
What do you mean?

18:40.203 --> 18:41.039
Did you find a cure?

18:42.139 --> 18:43.906
We've made some
positive steps forward,

18:43.908 --> 18:45.975
but we need more time.

18:45.977 --> 18:46.811
You have it.

18:47.679 --> 18:49.177
Not exactly.

18:49.179 --> 18:53.181
Rickter has found some
weakness in Sickness' hall.

18:53.183 --> 18:54.817
He thinks we may only
have a few weeks.

18:54.819 --> 18:56.552
We might need an extract.

18:56.554 --> 18:58.554
I think Rickter
is being paranoid.

18:58.556 --> 19:00.355
That facility as
well built and...

19:00.357 --> 19:02.458
And over 30 years old.

19:02.460 --> 19:04.927
And was given an
illegal inspection pass.

19:04.929 --> 19:07.162
So we could conduct
experiments here.

19:07.164 --> 19:08.466
Let's not kid one another.

19:09.801 --> 19:10.802
Yes, you're right.

19:11.970 --> 19:14.436
Keep me updated on
Rickter's reporting.

19:14.438 --> 19:15.370
I will.

19:15.372 --> 19:17.607
He's doing a thorough check now.

19:17.609 --> 19:19.809
Tell me more
about the antidote.

19:19.811 --> 19:22.545
Ann has made a breakthrough
in the shop at one strain.

19:22.547 --> 19:25.246
It appears she has successfully
been able to fight off

19:25.248 --> 19:26.749
a strain of the virus.

19:26.751 --> 19:28.383
Interesting.

19:28.385 --> 19:31.554
On a scale of one to 10, where
do you see us finding a cure?

19:31.556 --> 19:32.824
A marketable cure?

19:34.459 --> 19:35.691
I'd say a seven.

19:35.693 --> 19:36.892
I really think we're close,

19:36.894 --> 19:38.561
but would it be too late?

19:38.563 --> 19:40.830
It will never be late.

19:40.832 --> 19:43.001
Millions upon
millions have died.

19:44.469 --> 19:46.035
But many will survive.

19:46.037 --> 19:47.670
Gregory have you ever thought

19:47.672 --> 19:49.371
about what the
possessor of the cure

19:49.373 --> 19:51.476
for SHVID-1 holds in their hand?

19:52.710 --> 19:53.544
Salvation.

19:54.479 --> 19:55.711
The world.

19:55.713 --> 19:58.547
Gregory, let me tell you
what I can offer you.

20:09.326 --> 20:12.327
So tell me chief, what's
the real story here?

20:12.329 --> 20:14.565
How soon before this
tuna can implodes?

20:15.967 --> 20:16.834
Does it matter?

20:17.735 --> 20:19.135
Of course it does.

20:19.137 --> 20:21.070
I wanna get my way back home.

20:21.072 --> 20:23.539
And that elevator shaft
to the surface pad

20:23.541 --> 20:25.808
is our only way in
and out of here.

20:25.810 --> 20:27.576
So you got to keep us tight.

20:27.578 --> 20:29.111
Once we find a cure,

20:29.113 --> 20:32.650
if we find a cure, what
if they leave us here?

20:35.553 --> 20:37.555
Then we'll be heroes
to the human race.

20:38.656 --> 20:40.890
For those who succeed
there are always

20:40.892 --> 20:42.694
those who want the
reigning glory.

20:44.428 --> 20:46.595
Is that like from the Bible

20:46.597 --> 20:48.931
or the front of
some reading card?

20:48.933 --> 20:51.433
No, it's ancient philosophy.

20:51.435 --> 20:53.536
It means our hard work
may be taken from us

20:53.538 --> 20:55.805
and delivered by someone else.

20:55.807 --> 20:57.475
And we're left down here to die.

20:58.710 --> 21:01.045
Now that you put it that
way, it does kinda suck.

21:02.180 --> 21:04.214
Keep your eyes peeled
and your mind open.

21:07.250 --> 21:09.552
Looks I would speak English.

21:09.554 --> 21:12.021
Duke, please
report to the tank area.

21:12.023 --> 21:13.354
Need assistance.

21:15.526 --> 21:17.159
Think about what
I said. Gregory.

21:17.161 --> 21:18.326
Think hard.

21:18.328 --> 21:20.563
Report back at 1300 hours.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.980
Hey lady, I get
paid to protect,

21:37.982 --> 21:39.849
not to assist in lab work.

21:39.851 --> 21:40.983
I need to get a
sample from the shark,

21:40.985 --> 21:43.185
and I can't do it myself.

21:43.187 --> 21:44.787
Where's your girlfriend, Anna?

21:44.789 --> 21:46.522
She's a biologist, isn't she?

21:46.524 --> 21:48.291
She's dissecting a cadaver.

21:49.426 --> 21:50.828
Yeah, well what's
in it for me?

21:51.896 --> 21:53.195
Next time I shower,

21:53.197 --> 21:54.565
I'll let you guard the door.

21:56.033 --> 21:57.367
Now you got my attention.

21:59.036 --> 22:02.972
I need you to snag the
shark and pull it to the side.

22:02.974 --> 22:05.042
I just need five
seconds to get a sample.

22:05.943 --> 22:07.375
Bastard's strong.

22:07.377 --> 22:08.744
He could pull me in.

22:08.746 --> 22:10.748
And fight them off
with your machismo.

22:11.749 --> 22:12.982
My what?

22:12.984 --> 22:15.518
I fed them fish loaded
with sedatives earlier

22:15.520 --> 22:17.686
that should be enough
to manage them.

22:17.688 --> 22:18.621
Let's go.

22:26.230 --> 22:27.930
This isn't working.

22:27.932 --> 22:29.698
You need to attract
his attention.

22:29.700 --> 22:31.366
Smack the water with the pole,

22:31.368 --> 22:32.537
he likes the vibration.

22:33.638 --> 22:36.071
A little aquatic SNM.

22:36.073 --> 22:37.072
Duke likes that.

23:17.748 --> 23:18.583
Damn.

23:19.517 --> 23:20.417
Getting jumpy.

24:04.862 --> 24:06.495
What the hell are
you waiting for?

24:06.497 --> 24:09.333
I can hold this
thing much longer.

24:18.709 --> 24:19.644
I got it.

24:20.678 --> 24:21.512
Damn.

24:23.047 --> 24:24.713
The thing bit me.

24:26.384 --> 24:28.284
Let me see.
Let me see.

24:28.286 --> 24:29.852
It's only a scratch.

24:29.854 --> 24:31.487
It got away.

24:31.489 --> 24:32.721
Who cares?

24:32.723 --> 24:34.123
Got what you wanted, right?

24:34.125 --> 24:35.624
Yes.

24:35.626 --> 24:37.726
You better get to the lab
and let Ann fix you up.

24:37.728 --> 24:38.594
You think so.

24:38.596 --> 24:39.429
Yeah.

24:53.377 --> 24:55.413
I don't get paid
enough for this crap.

25:01.686 --> 25:04.253
Gregory. Gregory.

25:05.990 --> 25:06.822
Yes, Kristi.

25:06.824 --> 25:07.990
What is it?

25:07.992 --> 25:09.325
I was able to retrieve
a new blood sample

25:09.327 --> 25:10.626
from the great white.

25:10.628 --> 25:11.994
Good.

25:11.996 --> 25:12.995
You and Ann work
together on the antidote.

25:12.997 --> 25:14.229
We're running out of time.

25:14.231 --> 25:17.366
The shark escaped and
Duke was scratched.

25:17.368 --> 25:19.435
His on his way the
lab to get patched up.

25:19.437 --> 25:20.636
Is it serious?

25:20.638 --> 25:21.904
He'll live.

25:21.906 --> 25:23.839
Just a scratch that drew blood.

25:23.841 --> 25:25.441
I'm sorry about the shark.

25:25.443 --> 25:27.509
As long as you got the
samples it's of no concern.

25:27.511 --> 25:30.145
I'll get right back to
work and keep you posted.

25:30.147 --> 25:31.347
You do that.

25:39.190 --> 25:40.155
That was fast, Gregory.

25:40.157 --> 25:41.824
What's your answer?

25:41.826 --> 25:43.392
I'm in.

25:43.394 --> 25:45.294
Don't let me down.

25:45.296 --> 25:47.496
Don't let me down.

26:18.329 --> 26:19.530
Moisture inside.

26:21.532 --> 26:22.566
Pressure's building.

26:25.770 --> 26:26.604
Damn.

26:28.839 --> 26:30.105
Fuss off.

26:30.107 --> 26:31.508
Shoo.

26:48.059 --> 26:49.293
Pressure is rising.

26:58.669 --> 26:59.502
Ann?

27:01.238 --> 27:02.571
You around, Ann?

27:03.941 --> 27:04.775
Ann?

27:05.976 --> 27:07.209
I'm injured here.

27:07.211 --> 27:08.977
I could use a little
medical attention.

27:11.982 --> 27:13.518
Guess I'll have
to fix it myself.

27:25.896 --> 27:28.163
Mother, God that hurts.

27:46.183 --> 27:47.586
Thanks for nothing, Ann.

27:56.528 --> 27:57.527
Gregory, Gregory.

27:57.529 --> 27:58.760
I need to speak with you.

27:58.762 --> 28:00.362
I'm on my way to the
Med lab can it wait.

28:00.364 --> 28:01.964
This is of almost importance.

28:01.966 --> 28:02.798
All right.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.032
Out with it.

28:04.034 --> 28:05.701
The pressure on the
hole's increasing faster

28:05.703 --> 28:07.537
than I had initially indicated.

28:07.539 --> 28:08.770
Great. Just great.

28:08.772 --> 28:10.507
You said a few
weeks with any luck

28:10.509 --> 28:11.940
we'll be out of
here in a few days.

28:11.942 --> 28:13.610
We don't have a few days.

28:13.612 --> 28:15.310
Well, how much
time do we have?

28:15.312 --> 28:16.513
We have...

28:16.515 --> 28:17.480
Well?

28:17.482 --> 28:19.448
Less than 48 hours.

28:19.451 --> 28:20.382
Shit.

28:20.384 --> 28:21.520
That screws up everything.

28:22.653 --> 28:23.588
What do you mean?

28:24.955 --> 28:26.421
I want an in depth
analysis on your findings,

28:26.423 --> 28:27.990
and report directly to me.

28:27.992 --> 28:30.325
We need to evacuate right now.

28:30.327 --> 28:32.529
You'll do as you're
told and not tell anyone.

28:32.531 --> 28:33.697
Do you understand?

28:34.899 --> 28:36.131
We have plenty of
time to evacuate.

28:36.133 --> 28:38.369
Right now we need to
proceed with caution.

28:40.037 --> 28:41.336
If you insist.

28:41.338 --> 28:42.505
I do insists.

28:42.507 --> 28:44.543
Now get busy with your analysis.

28:53.851 --> 28:54.919
What awful timing.

29:14.738 --> 29:16.271
Ann?

29:16.273 --> 29:18.976
I have another blood sample
to run against the culture.

29:21.879 --> 29:22.980
Where the hell is she?

29:24.882 --> 29:25.814
I can run a sample,

29:25.816 --> 29:28.083
test just as good as she can.

29:39.897 --> 29:41.131
My God that's it.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.401
The secret was in
the metabolic level.

29:45.570 --> 29:47.706
The serum was here all along.

29:50.542 --> 29:52.808
We can duplicate this top side.

29:52.810 --> 29:54.111
We can start using it.

29:55.614 --> 29:56.979
The only thing going top side

29:56.981 --> 29:59.047
is your antidote and myself.

29:59.049 --> 30:00.182
Hand it over.

30:21.205 --> 30:24.141
Maybe I'll feel better if I
laid down for a little while.

30:40.324 --> 30:43.025
How the hell can that be?

30:55.540 --> 30:56.807
What the hell caused that?

31:01.546 --> 31:03.646
No fucking way.

31:09.788 --> 31:11.754
Please tell me
what this is about?

31:11.756 --> 31:14.089
It's pretty obvious, isn't it?

31:14.091 --> 31:15.558
You won't get away with this.

31:15.560 --> 31:16.958
What makes you think that?

31:16.960 --> 31:19.828
Cause they'll ask questions
when you get topside.

31:19.830 --> 31:23.231
Maybe, but they'll
believe what I tell them.

31:23.233 --> 31:25.133
Let me guess you will escape

31:25.135 --> 31:27.104
while meet an
unfortunate accident.

31:28.707 --> 31:30.540
I'll add a few more
heroics to the details,

31:30.542 --> 31:32.644
but yeah, more or less.

32:11.750 --> 32:13.348
The shark's gone crazy.

32:14.753 --> 32:17.152
This is my ticket to
everything I've always wanted.

32:17.154 --> 32:20.322
Your ambition lies in
microscopes and test tubes,

32:20.324 --> 32:22.324
mine lies in power.

32:22.326 --> 32:23.160
You're a fool.

32:25.062 --> 32:27.832
Muldoon, she sets you
up to this, didn't she?

32:28.767 --> 32:30.500
Who needs her?

32:30.502 --> 32:33.001
She would've stolen
the accolades anyway.

32:33.003 --> 32:35.471
I will give her
credit for inspiring

32:35.473 --> 32:38.006
my devious bait and switch.

32:38.008 --> 32:40.942
What makes you think she
won't have armed guards

32:40.944 --> 32:42.911
waiting for you once
you get top side.

32:42.913 --> 32:44.379
You step on that platform.

32:44.381 --> 32:47.048
You know, she's
probably playing you.

32:47.050 --> 32:48.684
There's too much at stake.

32:48.686 --> 32:51.219
We're both in it, 50,50.

32:51.221 --> 32:53.723
I think your math
skills and her math skills

32:53.725 --> 32:55.323
are slightly different.

32:55.325 --> 32:56.659
Doesn't matter.

32:56.661 --> 32:59.363
You won't be around
long enough to find out.

33:04.168 --> 33:05.902
Oh my God, Ann.

33:05.904 --> 33:06.736
I'll kill you.

33:06.738 --> 33:08.504
I swear, I'll kill you.

33:08.506 --> 33:10.305
I should really take
a look at that bite.

33:10.307 --> 33:12.007
You're not
looking at anything.

33:12.009 --> 33:13.509
What the hell happened to her?

33:13.511 --> 33:15.511
You tell me you're both
messing around in this lab.

33:15.513 --> 33:17.245
She looked like a man dog.

33:17.247 --> 33:18.548
I'm wondering what...

33:18.550 --> 33:19.381
Sleep on it.

33:32.464 --> 33:33.696
Gregory, Gregory.

33:33.698 --> 33:35.232
Not now, Rickter.

33:36.701 --> 33:39.669
Gregory, we're all gonna die.

34:05.128 --> 34:06.428
Muldoon, I have the antidote.

34:06.430 --> 34:08.129
They found it and I have it.

34:08.130 --> 34:10.967
There some loose ends
I have to take of here.

34:10.969 --> 34:12.835
Have an extraction team
waiting for me top side

34:12.837 --> 34:14.737
in 40 minutes.

34:14.739 --> 34:15.871
Hurry.

34:15.873 --> 34:17.540
As fast as you can.

34:17.542 --> 34:18.375
What?

34:20.612 --> 34:22.478
It's bad out here.

34:22.480 --> 34:23.313
Real bad.

34:24.348 --> 34:26.451
The virus spreading rapidly.

34:27.752 --> 34:32.487
Execution and burial
on a mass scale.

34:32.489 --> 34:34.626
Gregory, I need the serum.

34:35.927 --> 34:38.895
I'm sending an extraction team.

34:38.897 --> 34:39.964
Please hurry.

34:43.701 --> 34:46.134
I need the sheriff
authorization key.

34:46.136 --> 34:46.971
Where is it?

35:22.372 --> 35:23.206
Hey there.

35:24.308 --> 35:25.510
Miss Ann is that you.

35:30.414 --> 35:31.647
Don't be playing games with me

35:31.649 --> 35:32.884
we're in serious trouble.

35:50.902 --> 35:52.868
This place is getting
weirder by the minute.

36:01.613 --> 36:02.979
Bustard.

36:02.981 --> 36:03.813
Jeez.

36:03.815 --> 36:04.880
Are you okay, Kristi?

36:04.882 --> 36:07.315
Just a little bump on my head.

36:07.317 --> 36:09.150
This place has gone mad.

36:09.152 --> 36:10.653
Ann is creeping
around the halls.

36:10.655 --> 36:12.788
Gregory's in a mood.

36:12.790 --> 36:14.255
Gregory betrayed us.

36:14.257 --> 36:15.891
He took off with the anecdote.

36:15.893 --> 36:17.127
He's going top side.

36:18.295 --> 36:20.261
Ann is infected,
I don't know how.

36:20.263 --> 36:21.464
She is.

36:21.466 --> 36:22.965
It gets worse than
that I'm afraid.

36:22.967 --> 36:24.767
How much worse?

36:24.769 --> 36:26.836
The sickness has about
30 hours of life left

36:26.838 --> 36:28.436
in her before she implodes.

36:28.438 --> 36:30.205
But it won't matter
because all the oxygen

36:30.207 --> 36:32.340
will be gone in less
than eight hours.

36:32.342 --> 36:33.876
Why did you have
to tell me that?

36:33.878 --> 36:35.310
We need to evacuate.

36:35.312 --> 36:36.144
Duke.

36:36.146 --> 36:37.079
We have to get Duke.

36:37.081 --> 36:38.179
Okay, we'll get out of here.

37:02.807 --> 37:03.739
Duke.

37:03.741 --> 37:04.473
Duke, wake up, wake up, wake up.

37:04.475 --> 37:05.306
What the hell?

37:05.308 --> 37:06.509
I'm I dreaming.

37:06.511 --> 37:07.645
Oh, it's a nightmare.

37:09.781 --> 37:11.047
We have to get out of here.

37:11.049 --> 37:12.447
We're leaving.

37:12.449 --> 37:13.983
Leaving?

37:13.985 --> 37:15.685
We have to get the Gregory
before he gets the elevator

37:15.687 --> 37:17.453
and abandons us
with the antidote.

37:17.455 --> 37:18.386
Antidote?

37:18.388 --> 37:20.188
I might need some of that stuff.

37:20.190 --> 37:22.458
I never liked that guy anyway.

37:22.460 --> 37:24.225
You never liked anyone.

37:24.227 --> 37:25.494
Grab your guns.

37:25.496 --> 37:27.395
We might need em if
some heat goes down.

37:27.397 --> 37:28.396
Listen to you.

37:28.398 --> 37:29.532
Come on.

39:18.176 --> 39:19.008
Damn it.

39:19.010 --> 39:20.843
It might be too late.

39:20.845 --> 39:21.911
Maybe not.

39:21.913 --> 39:22.778
Come on.

39:33.124 --> 39:34.623
Damn it.
Come on.

39:40.397 --> 39:41.797
It's too late you can't stop me.

39:57.215 --> 39:59.748
Once these doors close
it's too late for you.

40:03.988 --> 40:05.855
See you in hell.

40:05.857 --> 40:07.890
We're not gonna stop
him it's too late.

40:11.195 --> 40:13.197
Don't worry I shot him
in the femoral artery.

40:17.068 --> 40:19.367
Asshole will bleed to death
before he gets up top.

40:41.225 --> 40:42.791
What's that?

40:45.763 --> 40:47.963
The vicious shark
I forgot to mention.

40:47.965 --> 40:49.164
Oh great.

40:49.166 --> 40:50.801
It's just keeps getting
better and better.

41:15.559 --> 41:17.059
The last bit
antidote we had left.

41:17.061 --> 41:18.594
Is that gonna cure me

41:18.596 --> 41:20.863
or am I going to turn into
one of those virus things?

41:20.865 --> 41:22.331
I don't know.

41:22.333 --> 41:24.099
You're the first like guinea
pig we've tested it on.

41:24.101 --> 41:26.135
That gives me a
lot of confidence.

41:26.137 --> 41:29.371
Do you think it'll work on
Ann or is she too far gone?

41:29.373 --> 41:30.372
I don't have any left.

41:30.374 --> 41:31.439
I can make some more.

41:31.441 --> 41:33.709
What difference will it make?

41:33.711 --> 41:34.777
Yeah, that's right.

41:34.779 --> 41:36.478
We either suffocate from no air,

41:36.480 --> 41:38.013
get crushed from the pressure

41:38.015 --> 41:40.783
or get eaten by that
virus faced shark.

41:40.785 --> 41:42.384
Great options we have here.

41:42.386 --> 41:43.852
We need a plan.

41:43.854 --> 41:44.820
We need a plan all right.

41:44.822 --> 41:46.755
What the hell is it?

41:46.757 --> 41:48.590
We need help from top side.

41:48.592 --> 41:51.460
They can send us a submersible
down to extract us.

41:51.462 --> 41:52.863
Let's get on the horn then.

41:59.136 --> 41:59.937
We connected.

42:00.805 --> 42:01.804
You're breaking up.

42:01.806 --> 42:03.205
What?

42:03.207 --> 42:05.474
This is emergency
personnel meeting extraction

42:05.476 --> 42:07.443
at Sickness Research Base.

42:07.445 --> 42:09.845
All hell is
breaking loose up here.

42:09.847 --> 42:12.281
Our surface elevator
was destroyed.

42:12.283 --> 42:14.350
The situation is grim.

42:14.352 --> 42:16.954
Structure failure and
oxygen disruption.

42:18.122 --> 42:19.788
I don't think
we can afford the...

42:24.128 --> 42:26.729
Hello. Hello.

42:26.731 --> 42:28.097
Damn it.

42:28.099 --> 42:29.031
Forget it.

42:29.033 --> 42:30.399
We're completely cut off.

42:30.401 --> 42:31.967
It's that damn shark.

42:31.969 --> 42:33.602
It tore all the oxygen
couplings apart.

42:33.604 --> 42:35.170
Now it's crippled
our communication.

42:35.172 --> 42:37.439
Don't forget about
the elevator shaft.

42:37.441 --> 42:39.575
Why would a shark target us?

42:39.577 --> 42:41.076
Just like the
rest of the world

42:41.078 --> 42:44.380
the virus has driven it
bad and where its target.

42:44.382 --> 42:45.781
It's that simple.

42:45.783 --> 42:47.049
Yeah.

42:47.051 --> 42:48.283
This place is gonna
come down around us

42:48.285 --> 42:49.918
and send us into
our watery grave.

42:49.920 --> 42:51.153
Rickter you
designed this place.

42:51.155 --> 42:52.721
You have to know
all the way out.

42:52.723 --> 42:54.656
I retrofitted
this installation.

42:54.658 --> 42:56.225
I did not design it.

42:56.227 --> 42:57.926
Had I, we wouldn't
be in this situation.

42:57.928 --> 43:01.030
It has to be an
alternate oxygen supply.

43:01.032 --> 43:02.664
And another way out of here.

43:02.666 --> 43:04.867
Even if there was the
pressure failure is crushing us

43:04.869 --> 43:06.402
like a tin can.

43:06.404 --> 43:07.336
There's gotta be something.

43:07.338 --> 43:08.272
Think man.

43:09.673 --> 43:12.441
In the mechanical office
there's schematics and plans.

43:12.443 --> 43:14.543
Maybe we can find
something there.

43:14.545 --> 43:16.178
Let's do it.

43:16.180 --> 43:18.515
I'll stay here, work on another
batch of the antidote out.

43:18.517 --> 43:20.315
I'll bolt the door
so knock three times

43:20.317 --> 43:21.518
when you'd come back.

43:21.520 --> 43:22.651
All right, let's
get a move on.

43:58.656 --> 43:59.855
Hey, did you see that?

43:59.857 --> 44:01.423
Look like the shark.

44:05.830 --> 44:07.062
Yeah, it's a mean bastard.

44:07.064 --> 44:08.964
Brain's effected by the virus.

44:08.966 --> 44:11.800
What if he decides to
kamikaze these glass plates?

44:11.802 --> 44:13.470
How long can you
hold your breath?

44:13.472 --> 44:15.170
I'm serious.

44:15.172 --> 44:16.972
Oh, his glasses as
tough as they come.

44:16.974 --> 44:19.108
But with the weakening structure

44:19.110 --> 44:20.943
who knows how much
force it can withstand.

44:20.945 --> 44:21.779
Great.

45:12.163 --> 45:13.498
What the hell?

46:14.091 --> 46:16.225
She's starting to go.

46:17.462 --> 46:18.796
Where did it go?

46:22.166 --> 46:23.067
Here we go.

46:29.474 --> 46:30.741
It's not there.

46:34.512 --> 46:35.877
That's not good.

46:35.879 --> 46:36.713
No.

46:36.715 --> 46:41.285
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

46:42.353 --> 46:43.653
Is there an invisible
man in the room

46:43.655 --> 46:44.987
or would you like to talk to me?

46:44.989 --> 46:46.489
Quiet, Duke.
I'm looking.

46:46.491 --> 46:47.690
For what?

46:47.692 --> 46:48.526
A solution.

46:50.427 --> 46:52.894
Can we route the oxygen lines.

46:52.896 --> 46:54.363
God impossible.

46:54.365 --> 46:55.199
Meaning?

46:56.534 --> 46:57.866
It's all over my friend.

47:06.443 --> 47:07.376
Damn it.

47:07.378 --> 47:08.480
Hey, watch it.

47:11.248 --> 47:12.383
Wait a minute.

47:14.051 --> 47:14.885
What is this?

47:21.825 --> 47:23.925
Let's go.
We don't have much time.

47:23.927 --> 47:25.461
We don't have much time.

47:25.463 --> 47:26.428
So we gotta go.

47:31.435 --> 47:32.434
Get away from me.

47:33.203 --> 47:34.036
No.

47:34.038 --> 47:35.103
Get away from me.

47:35.939 --> 47:36.773
Stand aside.

47:40.077 --> 47:41.778
Thank God, you guys
got here just in time.

47:41.780 --> 47:43.680
You're okay now.

47:43.682 --> 47:44.913
What did you find out?

47:44.915 --> 47:47.449
The oxygen lines in
this place unrepairable

47:47.452 --> 47:49.786
and its bending like wet noodle.

47:49.788 --> 47:50.886
It's all over then.

47:50.888 --> 47:53.523
Not exactly.

47:53.525 --> 47:54.356
What does that mean.

47:54.358 --> 47:55.591
I have no idea.

47:55.593 --> 47:57.292
He won't tell me either.

47:57.294 --> 47:59.529
On level D there's
an escape pod.

47:59.531 --> 48:01.396
A backup in case
the shaft failed.

48:01.398 --> 48:04.068
It's designed to bounce the
pressure and slowly rise.

48:05.202 --> 48:06.335
Let's go.

48:25.422 --> 48:26.522
I think it's this way.

48:36.200 --> 48:37.600
Here it is.

48:37.602 --> 48:39.736
We gonna have to
go one at a time.

48:39.738 --> 48:40.703
Kristi you go first.

48:40.705 --> 48:41.537
Okay.

48:48.747 --> 48:49.911
Okay, Rickter you're next.

48:55.820 --> 48:57.018
Buckle in, we
don't have much time.

48:57.020 --> 48:57.953
Where's Duke?

48:57.955 --> 48:59.555
Duke is right behind me.

49:16.273 --> 49:17.874
Just go.

49:17.876 --> 49:19.174
Save yourselves.

49:22.714 --> 49:24.279
Duke. Duke.

49:25.115 --> 49:26.415
It's too late for him.

49:56.581 --> 49:58.313
At least we have the antidote.

50:11.161 --> 50:13.463
What the bloody hell is that?

50:13.465 --> 50:15.063
It's the virus shark.

50:15.065 --> 50:17.299
Who drives that demon animal.

50:17.301 --> 50:18.202
Oh my God, look.

50:35.720 --> 50:38.420
How much longer till
we reach the surface?

50:38.422 --> 50:39.791
About 45 minutes.

50:40.792 --> 50:42.892
Are we going to make it?

50:42.894 --> 50:44.460
We made it this far.

51:51.529 --> 51:52.360
It's okay.

51:52.362 --> 51:53.263
You're only dreaming.

51:54.465 --> 51:56.231
Look, we're almost
at the surface.

51:56.233 --> 51:57.267
10 more minutes.

51:59.269 --> 52:00.203
Oh Thank God.

52:01.071 --> 52:02.306
Thank you for everything.

52:03.440 --> 52:04.576
Don't mention it.

52:11.081 --> 52:12.247
It's attacking us.

52:15.218 --> 52:16.552
We're almost at the top.

52:22.560 --> 52:24.493
This should give
him think about.

52:27.966 --> 52:30.332
Ah, there take that.

52:30.334 --> 52:32.001
He'll think twice
before doing that again.

54:28.953 --> 54:32.023
At first I thought
had been a bad dream.

54:32.990 --> 54:34.357
Then I saw the wreckage,

54:35.727 --> 54:39.394
and I knew what had
happened was all too real.

54:39.396 --> 54:44.401
I was somewhere, nowhere,
but I was at least alive.

54:46.303 --> 54:47.505
And I had the serum.

54:48.940 --> 54:52.577
I'm guessing Rickter is gone,
eaten by the mutated shark.

54:53.745 --> 54:57.278
I need to find
someone, something,

54:57.280 --> 55:00.952
resemblance of reality to
help me from going insane.

55:02.019 --> 55:03.221
Maybe it's all over.

55:04.354 --> 55:06.522
Maybe there is no one else.

55:41.125 --> 55:42.525
Hello?

55:42.527 --> 55:43.393
I'm Kristi.

55:44.562 --> 55:45.730
Do you know where I am?

55:46.931 --> 55:49.364
Do you know where I
could find some help?

55:53.571 --> 55:54.404
Oh.

55:56.541 --> 55:57.372
I see.

56:22.500 --> 56:23.333
Hello.

56:24.802 --> 56:25.636
Hello.

57:18.789 --> 57:20.222
Oh God.

57:20.224 --> 57:22.658
It's about as fast
food as it's gonna get.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.135
I'm going crazy.

58:07.538 --> 58:10.139
Well, well, well
what do we have here?

58:10.141 --> 58:12.574
Today's our lucky day.

58:12.576 --> 58:13.809
Please, I need your help.

58:13.811 --> 58:16.045
I need to get to
someone in authority.

58:17.415 --> 58:19.381
There's no authority.

58:19.383 --> 58:20.651
No help for you.

58:26.223 --> 58:28.424
What are you looking at?

58:28.426 --> 58:29.625
She's clean.

58:29.627 --> 58:30.428
She's clean.

58:31.996 --> 58:34.029
I'm from an underwater
research base.

58:34.031 --> 58:35.698
We found a cure for the virus.

58:35.700 --> 58:38.100
I just need to get
to any officials.

58:38.102 --> 58:40.235
Consider us officials now.

58:40.237 --> 58:41.337
This is Jojo,

58:41.339 --> 58:43.341
I'm Mason and that's Garbage.

58:46.944 --> 58:48.544
Come on, give that back.

58:50.147 --> 58:51.580
I'll take that.

58:51.582 --> 58:53.615
No one tells Mace what to do.

58:53.617 --> 58:55.150
Lesson learned.

58:55.152 --> 58:56.852
I'll hold onto these.

58:56.854 --> 58:57.655
Where am I?

58:59.023 --> 59:00.789
You're with us.

59:00.791 --> 59:02.791
The whole world
is gone to hell.

59:02.793 --> 59:05.561
People places don't
matter anymore.

59:05.563 --> 59:07.298
What are we going
to do with her?

59:08.165 --> 59:10.366
I have a few ideas.

59:12.036 --> 59:14.169
Shut up a bunch of ya.

59:14.171 --> 59:15.938
I'm the man in charge here.

59:15.940 --> 59:19.008
I'll decide what
and when I do her.

59:19.010 --> 59:21.078
Y'all get the leftovers.

59:23.381 --> 59:24.215
Tie her up.

59:25.249 --> 59:27.349
We don't want her getting away.

59:27.351 --> 59:29.184
You're making a big mistake.

59:30.455 --> 59:32.254
Wouldn't be the
first time, Missy.

59:32.256 --> 59:33.456
Not so rough.

59:33.458 --> 59:35.524
You don't know
what rough is lady.

59:35.526 --> 59:36.427
But you will.

59:37.728 --> 59:40.629
Have Garbage get the
water from the creek.

59:44.568 --> 59:46.135
But Mace?

59:46.137 --> 59:47.636
But what?

59:47.638 --> 59:50.941
Some skirts shows up and you
forget we have to survive.

59:52.643 --> 59:53.909
All right.

01:00:12.563 --> 01:00:14.763
You better not be lying to us.

01:00:14.765 --> 01:00:15.964
About what?

01:00:15.966 --> 01:00:18.602
About you being
from a research base.

01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:22.604
Maybe she's a marauder
and hasn't turned yet.

01:00:22.606 --> 01:00:24.173
What's a marauder?

01:00:24.175 --> 01:00:27.810
One of us except you're
driven by the madness

01:00:27.812 --> 01:00:29.013
to drink blood.

01:00:29.914 --> 01:00:32.781
No, that's not me.

01:00:32.783 --> 01:00:34.652
So this is the antidote, Huh?

01:00:36.087 --> 01:00:39.822
We could end up big men
with this in our hands.

01:00:39.824 --> 01:00:41.723
I knew someone who
had that same idea

01:00:41.725 --> 01:00:43.425
and it didn't end well.

01:00:43.427 --> 01:00:44.461
That's just a sample.

01:00:44.463 --> 01:00:45.794
I could make more.

01:00:45.796 --> 01:00:47.763
We have to get to a lab.

01:00:47.765 --> 01:00:50.299
There's a research
facility about 30 miles.

01:00:50.301 --> 01:00:52.034
Damn it, Jojo.

01:00:52.036 --> 01:00:54.837
You don't need to be
telling any secrets.

01:00:54.839 --> 01:00:59.810
Lady I'm gonna let you live for
now for a couple of reasons.

01:01:00.978 --> 01:01:03.814
But cross me and
you'll die slowly.

01:01:04.849 --> 01:01:06.448
May I please have some water.

01:01:06.451 --> 01:01:07.883
I'm very thirsty.

01:01:07.885 --> 01:01:10.052
When Garbage gets back.

01:01:10.054 --> 01:01:13.755
Until then sit over
there and shut up.

01:01:13.757 --> 01:01:15.458
Oh.

01:01:49.994 --> 01:01:52.961
Any of you mutant morons
wanna start something

01:01:52.963 --> 01:01:55.197
I'm gonna blow your heads off.

01:02:42.614 --> 01:02:45.682
I'm not one of you
yet come and get it.

01:02:49.353 --> 01:02:51.021
Two down more to go.

01:03:19.451 --> 01:03:21.484
Wake up, Jojo.

01:03:21.486 --> 01:03:24.989
You can't see the marauders
with both your eyes closed.

01:03:30.828 --> 01:03:31.663
You're pretty.

01:03:32.664 --> 01:03:33.732
Real pretty.

01:03:35.634 --> 01:03:38.534
All we get to look
at is marauders.

01:03:38.536 --> 01:03:42.838
And we're not too far away
from being ones ourselves.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:46.243
A year or maybe less.

01:03:47.978 --> 01:03:49.947
We all have our
cross to bear, do we?

01:03:50.814 --> 01:03:53.585
I had a wife, two kids.

01:03:54.586 --> 01:03:56.285
They're dead now.

01:03:56.287 --> 01:03:58.222
Along with the
rest of the world.

01:03:59.724 --> 01:04:02.494
It's like living in a science
fiction movie that never ends.

01:04:03.427 --> 01:04:05.561
We were researching the virus.

01:04:05.563 --> 01:04:09.931
It took us a really long time
to find the cure but we did.

01:04:09.933 --> 01:04:12.735
You sure were safe
down in your bubble,

01:04:12.737 --> 01:04:14.537
playing with the fish.

01:04:14.539 --> 01:04:17.105
Sharks not fish.

01:04:17.107 --> 01:04:19.308
We did the best we could
under the conditions.

01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:21.443
And what conditions
were those?

01:04:21.445 --> 01:04:26.048
Safety, warmth,
companionship, purpose.

01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:28.052
All we got were misery.

01:04:29.521 --> 01:04:33.656
You come here with your cure
for a bunch of mindless nomads

01:04:33.658 --> 01:04:35.525
who don't want it.

01:04:46.571 --> 01:04:47.404
Water.

01:04:50.341 --> 01:04:52.475
I had to kill two marauders

01:04:52.477 --> 01:04:55.010
they're getting more
bold and vicious.

01:04:56.246 --> 01:04:58.013
You better be
careful out there.

01:04:58.015 --> 01:05:00.384
Not that we all have
something to live for.

01:05:01.218 --> 01:05:02.252
Get her drink.

01:05:11.929 --> 01:05:14.766
You rotten demons,
come and get us a dare.

01:05:15.966 --> 01:05:18.266
What are we
gonna do now, Mace?

01:05:18.268 --> 01:05:19.736
I have a plan.

01:05:19.738 --> 01:05:21.303
First we'll eat dinner.

01:05:21.305 --> 01:05:22.237
Come on.

01:05:22.239 --> 01:05:23.706
Let's break up the rations.

01:05:27.211 --> 01:05:29.645
The way I see it we
got all the cards

01:05:29.647 --> 01:05:31.681
when we find the authorities.

01:05:31.683 --> 01:05:33.816
If we find authorities.

01:05:33.818 --> 01:05:35.884
What do you propose we do?

01:05:35.886 --> 01:05:39.589
We have the serum
and we have her.

01:05:39.591 --> 01:05:41.957
Both are good bargaining chips.

01:05:41.959 --> 01:05:44.059
I want a million dollars.

01:05:44.061 --> 01:05:45.628
Oh, that's all.

01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:49.297
We can have anything
we want you idiots.

01:05:49.299 --> 01:05:51.133
Money is worthless.

01:05:51.135 --> 01:05:53.268
What we want is power.

01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:56.071
Power to rule over everyone.

01:05:56.073 --> 01:05:58.006
So what's the plan, Mace?

01:05:58.008 --> 01:06:00.144
We still have the
raft by the beach.

01:06:01.311 --> 01:06:03.746
We can paddle out to
the old research base

01:06:03.748 --> 01:06:06.248
and see if anyone
is still there.

01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:10.018
Somebody has to be there
and we deal with them.

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:11.454
Why not walk?

01:06:11.456 --> 01:06:13.556
Too many marauders.

01:06:13.558 --> 01:06:15.725
You're forgetting
about the sharks.

01:06:15.727 --> 01:06:17.729
Hey, what's this about sharks.

01:06:19.864 --> 01:06:22.732
People aren't the only ones
affected by this virus.

01:06:22.734 --> 01:06:24.299
Sharks are too.

01:06:24.301 --> 01:06:26.368
And it makes them blood hungry.

01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:27.703
When I washed ashore,

01:06:27.705 --> 01:06:29.541
I saw a swarm of them.

01:06:31.008 --> 01:06:33.241
Maybe walking in
such a bad idea.

01:06:33.243 --> 01:06:35.177
I never did like the water.

01:06:35.179 --> 01:06:36.213
Will take the boat.

01:06:37.615 --> 01:06:40.449
It's safer that way and I'm
not afraid of no sharks.

01:06:40.452 --> 01:06:41.952
It's your funeral.

01:06:45.189 --> 01:06:46.856
I'd back off if I were you.

01:06:46.858 --> 01:06:48.758
Why is that smart mouth?

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.025
Because if you kill me,

01:06:50.027 --> 01:06:52.562
you decrease your
chance at leverage.

01:06:52.564 --> 01:06:56.366
Once that serum is gone
only I can make a new batch.

01:07:00.103 --> 01:07:01.436
Gather our stuff.

01:07:01.438 --> 01:07:03.004
We're moving out.

01:07:34.171 --> 01:07:35.437
Take em out.

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:49.886
Where'd she go?

01:07:49.888 --> 01:07:50.853
We got to find her.

01:08:08.706 --> 01:08:09.639
Come on.

01:08:09.641 --> 01:08:10.973
Watch out we gotta find her.

01:08:16.113 --> 01:08:19.247
You better Mace
find you first, bitch.

01:08:28.225 --> 01:08:29.926
You can't escape us.

01:08:29.928 --> 01:08:32.028
The marauders will
find you if we don't.

01:08:47.745 --> 01:08:48.978
Any sign of her?

01:08:48.979 --> 01:08:50.880
She's nowhere
to be found, Mace.

01:08:50.881 --> 01:08:52.247
She'll go to the beach.

01:08:52.249 --> 01:08:53.749
It's not safe in the woods.

01:08:53.751 --> 01:08:55.250
She knows we have a boat there.

01:08:55.252 --> 01:08:56.384
Come on.

01:09:01.425 --> 01:09:02.794
I have to find that book.

01:09:04.261 --> 01:09:06.629
I'll take my chances
with the shark.

01:09:21.377 --> 01:09:23.479
The boat has to be
hidden here somewhere.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.040
You cost us a lot
of trouble girly.

01:09:52.274 --> 01:09:54.977
And after we showed
you so much hospitality,

01:09:54.979 --> 01:09:56.545
Thanks for getting
the boat ready.

01:09:56.547 --> 01:09:57.780
Screw you.

01:09:57.782 --> 01:09:59.649
There'll be time
for that later.

01:09:59.651 --> 01:10:02.618
Jojo get the boat launched.

01:10:19.403 --> 01:10:22.538
I don't think this
is such a good idea.

01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:24.674
Do as you're
told you half wit.

01:10:24.676 --> 01:10:25.977
And be quick about it.

01:10:31.181 --> 01:10:32.815
See you big baby.

01:10:32.817 --> 01:10:34.984
There's nothing to be afraid of.

01:10:41.726 --> 01:10:43.291
We're not getting out of here.

01:10:43.293 --> 01:10:45.928
No. You're not
getting out of here.

01:10:51.869 --> 01:10:53.803
Are you okay miss?

01:10:53.805 --> 01:10:55.104
Yes.

01:10:55.106 --> 01:10:56.337
Thank you.

01:10:56.339 --> 01:10:59.274
You're from the Sickness
Research Facility.

01:10:59.276 --> 01:11:00.078
Yes.

01:11:01.746 --> 01:11:03.546
You have orders
to come with me.

01:11:03.548 --> 01:11:05.981
We trace the recon signal
from your escape pod

01:11:05.983 --> 01:11:07.315
to the Island.

01:11:07.317 --> 01:11:09.452
Do you have the serum?

01:11:14.992 --> 01:11:16.559
Is it too late?

01:11:16.561 --> 01:11:19.197
No ma'am but the
world isn't the same.

01:11:20.164 --> 01:11:21.099
Never will be.

01:11:22.633 --> 01:11:23.866
Come on.

01:11:23.868 --> 01:11:25.333
The submarine is
waiting off shore

01:11:25.335 --> 01:11:27.839
to take us to a secret
base off Canadian waters.

01:11:28.806 --> 01:11:30.072
Why there?

01:11:30.074 --> 01:11:32.007
It's all that's
left of humanity.

01:11:32.009 --> 01:11:35.811
130 people including the
submarine crew and yourself.

01:11:35.813 --> 01:11:36.647
Come on.

01:11:58.469 --> 01:12:01.369
It really is all over.

01:12:58.043 --> 01:13:03.043
