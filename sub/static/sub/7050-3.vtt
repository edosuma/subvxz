00:02.044 --> 00:03.336
Previously on Justified...

00:03.420 --> 00:06.255
Drew Thompson pancaking
into that driveway...

00:06.340 --> 00:08.424
That was the day cocaine
came to Harlan County.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.134
Where the hell is Drew Thompson?

00:10.219 --> 00:12.553
What I want is for you to find out

00:12.638 --> 00:14.138
why our sales have dropped off.

00:14.223 --> 00:15.848
This church is the reason.

00:15.933 --> 00:18.226
Why are you here, newcomers?

00:18.310 --> 00:22.563
You all come to watch
the hillbilly with the snakes?

00:22.648 --> 00:26.275
Or did you come to be saved?

00:26.485 --> 00:30.530
"Do not believe every spirit,
but test the spirits!"

00:30.656 --> 00:33.282
Everybody in that church
was smiling ear to ear

00:33.367 --> 00:34.534
except for his sister.

00:34.660 --> 00:37.120
Now, we find out what it is she wants,

00:37.204 --> 00:38.913
and these flood waters will recede.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.540
You're new around here.

00:40.624 --> 00:42.959
Folks bet less on fights
between fighters they don't know.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.627
What, I got to fight again?

00:48.424 --> 00:51.759
In the right light,
you could be considered attractive.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.598
I just need to have
a quick word with my wife.

01:04.063 --> 01:07.900
How come you don't keep
the snakes in here to sleep?

01:09.194 --> 01:10.778
Billy's room's warmer.

01:10.863 --> 01:13.030
Oh, that's your brother's room, huh...

01:13.407 --> 01:15.867
The one you're sneaking out of
in the dead of the night?

01:16.160 --> 01:17.326
I sing hymns over him

01:17.411 --> 01:19.328
until his brain's quiet enough to let him rest.

01:19.872 --> 01:21.164
So that's all you were doing in there...

01:21.248 --> 01:23.124
Just tucking in your brother...

01:23.208 --> 01:25.126
Him and all his serpents?

01:25.210 --> 01:29.005
Way you riled him up,
I'm surprised he got to sleep at all.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.923
I came in here earlier tonight

01:31.008 --> 01:34.385
thinking that your brother
was running his own show,

01:34.470 --> 01:36.179
thinking he was the man I needed to talk to

01:36.263 --> 01:38.556
if I was gonna have any peace.

01:38.640 --> 01:42.810
But it turns out that he's a true believer.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.271
But you...

01:48.066 --> 01:50.526
Why, you're the brains.

01:53.155 --> 01:54.238
What's that?

01:56.492 --> 01:57.867
What's it look like?

01:57.951 --> 02:02.580
Like the 30 pieces of silver the high priest
Caiaphas gave to Judas Iscariot.

02:02.664 --> 02:06.042
Well, think of it as a donation from
a concerned parishioner

02:06.126 --> 02:10.045
who'd like to see your brother shift focus
away from me and mine.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.090
I'm afraid you've misjudged me, Mr Crowder.

02:13.884 --> 02:16.677
I would never tell my brother
how to spread the good word.

02:17.763 --> 02:19.305
How about where to spread it?

02:19.431 --> 02:20.890
Now, that's a different conversation.

02:21.850 --> 02:24.310
It's a more expensive one.

02:24.394 --> 02:27.647
It's good to know
we both speak the same tongues.

02:28.106 --> 02:29.732
The thing is...

02:30.776 --> 02:32.485
I don't get shaken down.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.071
Don't think of it as a shakedown.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.698
Billy deserves a pulpit that can't be folded up

02:37.783 --> 02:40.076
and put in the back of a truck.

02:40.202 --> 02:43.079
You want us gone,
you're gonna have to build us a place to go.

02:43.705 --> 02:49.794
Well, then, ma'am,
I apologise for simply wasting your time.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.798
I know why you keep misjudging us.

02:53.882 --> 02:54.966
Do tell.

02:55.050 --> 02:58.427
Unlike the rest of
these sorry souls around here...

02:59.012 --> 03:01.013
We're not afraid of you.

03:01.306 --> 03:06.477
Well, in that case, ma'am,
I think we've misjudged each other.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.535
You awake?

03:22.619 --> 03:23.911
I am now.

03:24.413 --> 03:25.913
Since when do you sleep in your clothes?

03:25.998 --> 03:28.457
Couldn't figure out a way to keep a gun
in my undershorts.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.334
Since when do you sleep with a gun?

03:30.419 --> 03:32.295
Since I found out the woman I've been seeing

03:32.379 --> 03:35.298
has a husband I couldn't knock down
with a hammer.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.301
He's not my husband any more.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.635
I ain't asking.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.970
I'm telling you.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.347
I divorced him when he got put away
this last time.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.558
I had him pegged as a con.

03:46.268 --> 03:48.644
That, or maybe a fighter.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.898
Actually, he's both.
I mean, fighting's his real calling.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.774
We just never made much money at it.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.151
How did he make his money?

03:55.235 --> 03:56.277
The old-fashioned way.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.403
He stole it?

03:57.487 --> 03:58.946
We stole it.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.662
That's your deep, dark secret, huh?

04:06.747 --> 04:09.081
If it's not,
I'd hate to think of what else I'd be hiding.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.249
What was the deal?

04:10.334 --> 04:13.294
You guys picking pockets,
robbing liquor stores?

04:13.378 --> 04:15.588
I'd get next to a guy,
find out what he had worth taking,

04:15.672 --> 04:17.089
and Randall would take it.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.341
Simple.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.675
Always figured the simpler we kept it,

04:19.801 --> 04:21.010
the less chance it'd go wrong.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.095
But it did go wrong, huh?

04:23.180 --> 04:24.180
Yeah.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.183
And no. I mean, the scam itself was fine.

04:27.517 --> 04:30.770
The problem came
when Randall decided he didn't like the idea

04:30.854 --> 04:34.190
these guys had been
putting their hands on me, and...

04:34.274 --> 04:35.942
Ended up beating one half to death.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.694
Which is why he went
to prison and you didn't.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.363
Yeah.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.572
Well...

04:42.032 --> 04:44.742
I know I feel better, knowing all this.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.122
You one of those guys
who loses interest in a woman

04:50.248 --> 04:53.084
once he realises
she can't wear white to her wedding?

04:53.377 --> 04:55.294
I'd like to think not.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.050
I was hoping if I came clean,
you'd understand I reformed.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.885
Maybe even...

05:04.304 --> 05:07.139
...see your way clear
to forgiving me my trespasses.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.224
Yeah?

05:09.017 --> 05:11.060
I guess it just depends.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.062
On what?

05:13.480 --> 05:15.189
How bad were you?

05:18.860 --> 05:20.653
I was pretty bad.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.115
Still am sometimes.

05:27.536 --> 05:29.662
I guess the only question I'm still asking is

05:29.746 --> 05:32.832
if Randall beat the shit out of some guy
for rubbing on you,

05:32.916 --> 05:35.292
how's he gonna react
when he finds out what we've been doing?

05:35.419 --> 05:38.129
I'll tell you what I just told Randall.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.423
I don't owe him shit.

05:41.717 --> 05:43.676
So, do you think
that you could forget about him

05:43.760 --> 05:46.012
just long enough that we could get back

05:46.096 --> 05:48.597
to what we were doing
when he interrupted us?

05:52.352 --> 05:54.228
I can give it a shot.

06:10.037 --> 06:13.247
Carrot didn't work.
Means it's time for the stick.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.259
Jimmy! Don't move! Jimmy!

07:07.344 --> 07:09.512
- Oh, shit. They're everywhere. Jimmy!
- Shit!

07:11.598 --> 07:12.932
Get out of there!

07:14.184 --> 07:15.518
Jimmy.

07:16.478 --> 07:17.770
Stop firing!

07:18.313 --> 07:19.855
Get up!

07:23.693 --> 07:24.944
Holy...

08:06.403 --> 08:09.321
- Boyd!
- Did you send that preacher packing?

08:17.080 --> 08:18.831
What the hell happened?

08:19.166 --> 08:20.249
I think a snake bit him.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.500
Thank you.

08:21.585 --> 08:22.835
Call Johnny. Tell him to get a hold of

08:22.919 --> 08:24.086
that doc he uses from physical therapy.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.337
Johnny's not answering.

08:25.422 --> 08:26.589
I tried him before I decided to come here.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.257
Well, go find a doctor.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.509
Tell him to get a hold
of some antivenom and bring his ass here!

08:30.594 --> 08:32.344
Where am I supposed to find a doctor?

08:32.429 --> 08:33.679
The free clinic in Evarts.

08:33.763 --> 08:34.847
Go!

08:36.390 --> 08:39.894
Hold on, son. You're lucky to be alive.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.395
Where the hell is Johnny?

08:51.615 --> 08:54.867
Jesus. I hope that ain't necessary.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.204
She said I took her by surprise,

08:58.288 --> 09:01.290
showing up the way I did,
and where am I staying?

09:01.374 --> 09:02.583
We got things to discuss.

09:02.667 --> 09:03.709
I know, Randall.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.794
I was standing
right next to her when she called you.

09:05.879 --> 09:09.632
Turns out she just needed to know where to
send her big, bad deputy marshal.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.300
Jesus. You living out of this locker?

09:11.384 --> 09:13.469
Showering here,
sleeping in your car, something like that?

09:13.887 --> 09:16.513
Well, I was gonna
try to sleep on the couch in Emanuel's office,

09:16.640 --> 09:18.807
but it turns out he's doing that himself.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.936
Thinks sleeping
in the gym will turn him into Cus D'Amato.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.062
You know who that is?

09:23.146 --> 09:25.147
Where'd you do your bit... Glades?

09:25.273 --> 09:27.316
This last one... Okaloosa, mostly.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.984
That's near Pensacola?

09:29.069 --> 09:32.988
Nicer than Glades
from the outside, but the tiers were shit.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.823
I used to work out of the Miami office.

09:34.950 --> 09:36.116
Didn't get up north much.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.244
Yeah, I grew up down near Glades...

09:38.328 --> 09:41.080
West of Belle Glade, out near Immolakee.

09:41.164 --> 09:44.792
Prefer it up north, though.
Better class of people, by and large.

09:45.669 --> 09:48.504
You move up north
once you started fighting?

09:48.630 --> 09:50.172
- You ever do any?
- Boxing?

09:50.257 --> 09:52.007
- Cage fighting.
- Not lately.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.759
Nowadays,
you want to compete with these guys,

09:53.843 --> 09:55.177
even as a puncher, you got to be able

09:55.303 --> 09:58.847
to know how to do
that Brazilian stuff, maybe a little chop suey.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.767
I came at it way too late to
develop any real technique.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.853
That's why you're
getting your stake together,

10:04.938 --> 10:06.855
get into fighter management.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.358
Get Lindsey to run the old scam,

10:09.526 --> 10:11.860
rip off some fella does backyard fights,

10:11.945 --> 10:15.447
name of Hoppus or Kopas?

10:17.701 --> 10:19.285
I guess she told you a lot, huh?

10:19.369 --> 10:21.036
She told me a little bit.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.788
It was late. We were in my bedroom.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.791
So we didn't talk as much as we should've.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.547
I paid my debt.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.632
Hers, too, when you think about it.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.884
You paid part of your debt.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.970
Not my fault the State
can't afford to keep us.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.472
No. We got to reserve space for the guys

10:40.557 --> 10:42.891
that pose a genuine danger to society.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.059
You read my jacket?

10:44.185 --> 10:46.812
Know the part
about your jacket that surprised me?

10:46.896 --> 10:50.983
Conditions of your release prohibit you from
leaving the State of Florida.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.985
And yet, here you are.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.029
Gonna tell my P.O. On me.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.989
That's not so big and bad after all.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.824
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

10:58.908 --> 11:03.078
I'm gonna give you till about...
Well, let's say 6:00.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.413
Get your shit out of that locker

11:04.497 --> 11:07.082
and get your ass back
on the road to Florida,

11:07.208 --> 11:08.542
or I'm gonna send you back.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.836
Up to you if it's in cuffs or a box.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.880
You read what I did to the last old boy

11:12.964 --> 11:14.340
tried to make time with my wife?

11:14.424 --> 11:16.258
Skimmed it. Something about a coma.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.052
No, I marked him.

11:18.511 --> 11:22.139
Now, anytime anybody sees that
little greaser gimp around,

11:22.223 --> 11:24.099
hears the punch-drunk way that he talks,

11:24.184 --> 11:26.477
what they're seeing and hearing is me.

11:27.062 --> 11:28.937
What I made him.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.565
So how about at 6:00 this p.m.,

11:31.649 --> 11:34.985
I put a little limp in that Gary Cooper walk,

11:35.070 --> 11:37.279
write my name all over
that pretty face of yours?

11:37.405 --> 11:39.114
How's that sound?

11:39.407 --> 11:41.533
Sounds like we got a date.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.623
- Oh, come!
- I'll come back.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.957
No, Raylan. Join us.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.167
It can wait. I'll just...

11:50.251 --> 11:52.294
Raylan! Join us.

11:53.296 --> 11:55.672
Rachel here was just about to explain to me

11:55.757 --> 11:57.174
why she didn't call for backup

11:57.258 --> 11:59.676
while she was
affecting the arrest of a violent fugitive.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.137
And I figure since that's
your area of expertise, you could weigh in.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.847
Like it says, by the time I made him,

12:03.932 --> 12:05.724
he was already standing over me.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.226
There was no way to call without him seeing.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.311
- You with us so far?
- It's all very...

12:09.396 --> 12:11.397
But Drew Thompson, Tim told me, come in...

12:11.481 --> 12:13.357
She's after this Andre Devoe...

12:13.608 --> 12:16.652
Apparently goes to this diner
whenever he wants to visit his mama.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.278
But she didn't actually make him

12:18.405 --> 12:20.197
until he was close enough to touch.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.990
Yesterday, I went there looking for him.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.284
I went back
this morning 'cause I liked the French toast.

12:24.369 --> 12:25.411
And then, to make matters worse,

12:25.495 --> 12:26.662
she went to the ladies' room.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.831
I was trying to
get some distance so I could call it in.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.332
You should at least approve of that.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.501
I'm supposed to approve
of you trapping yourself

12:32.585 --> 12:34.753
in a confined space
with one door and no windows.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.422
How many times has Wyatt Earp here

12:36.506 --> 12:38.841
put himself in positions like that and worse,

12:38.925 --> 12:40.884
and how many reprimands
have you written him?

12:41.010 --> 12:42.052
Oh, he's a lost cause.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.762
I still have some hope for you.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.185
What a good example you've set.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.854
Drew Thompson?

12:52.897 --> 12:54.231
Thompson's widow.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.608
Remarried six months
after Drew hit the side...

12:56.693 --> 12:58.235
I mean, didn't hit the sidewalk.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.403
I knew what you meant.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.321
That's why it took some doing to find her.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.532
Thought at first
she might be in the wind with him.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.576
You know, just playing the grieving widow

13:05.660 --> 13:09.246
until the cops and the news
people moved on to another story,

13:09.664 --> 13:11.707
and then fold up the tent
and change her name.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.417
That's actually a decent plan.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.793
Thank you for saying so.

13:14.878 --> 13:17.045
- She still married?
- Divorced.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.590
Why don't you and Tim ride
down to Masterson station,

13:19.674 --> 13:22.968
see how she reacts to you
un-breaking the news of Drew's demise?

13:23.344 --> 13:24.761
All righty.

13:24.846 --> 13:26.305
- Oh, and, Raylan?
- Yes.

13:26.389 --> 13:29.516
At the time of his death,
Drew Thompson was wanted

13:29.601 --> 13:32.394
in a sealed federal witness warrant.

13:32.687 --> 13:33.729
What'd he witness?

13:33.813 --> 13:36.315
Well, I don't know.
That's what "sealed" means.

13:37.233 --> 13:40.527
Admit it... You're getting
a little bit of a marshal stiffy yourself.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.946
Maybe. If you get it unsealed.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.157
Hoping for some movement
on that later today.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.658
If my stiffy lasts much longer,

13:46.743 --> 13:48.744
I'm gonna have to consult my physician.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.538
- What's your opinion?
- On your stiffy? I don't have one.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.499
No. On what's going on with Rachel.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.919
If I had one,
I sure as hell wouldn't tell the boss.

13:58.630 --> 14:03.425
Mr Crowder, I feel like
I made it clear last time we were together.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.052
I'm not looking for a partner.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.934
You made it clear that you weren't
looking for a partner you can't trust.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.811
I can trust you?

14:14.896 --> 14:18.524
Do you have any idea what
Boyd would do to me if he knew I was here?

14:18.608 --> 14:20.734
Unless he sent you.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.194
He didn't.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.071
Yeah.

14:24.322 --> 14:27.699
Well,
comforting as that is,

14:28.952 --> 14:31.537
I keep remembering our mutual pal Devil,

14:31.621 --> 14:33.622
who assured myself and Mr Quarles

14:33.706 --> 14:35.290
that he could count on your support

14:35.375 --> 14:38.460
in his move against your cousin,

14:38.545 --> 14:43.006
and I keep thinking,
if that had worked out for him,

14:43.091 --> 14:45.592
we probably would've
heard something by now.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.303
- Mr Duffy?
- Yeah.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.974
I can walk with this cane, but it hurts.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.601
It's so much easier
just to roll around in my damn chair.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.770
Boyd put me in that chair.

14:56.854 --> 14:59.856
I always heard it was
his daddy's shotgun that did that.

14:59.941 --> 15:01.233
I was the heir apparent.

15:01.317 --> 15:05.195
Boyd has never been
nothing but a thorn in his daddy's fat ass.

15:05.280 --> 15:09.449
So, now, how is it that he's the one
that's gonna get everything?

15:11.744 --> 15:12.911
Boys.

15:13.204 --> 15:14.580
Would you excuse us?

15:20.753 --> 15:24.047
Mr Crowder, as strange as this sounds...

15:25.425 --> 15:27.092
I want to believe you.

15:28.469 --> 15:34.558
So, what if I were
to give him to you, serve him up?

15:35.059 --> 15:36.518
When you say him, you mean...

15:36.686 --> 15:37.811
Boyd.

15:38.605 --> 15:43.317
Okay. And when you say
"serve him up," you mean...

15:46.237 --> 15:48.864
What if I were to help you kill him?

15:54.912 --> 15:56.705
I could... I could take him to an E.R.,

15:56.789 --> 15:57.998
say I found him on the side of the road.

15:58.082 --> 16:00.959
You're wasting time. Do it.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.210
Do you want a belt, son?

16:02.879 --> 16:04.755
All right. Open your mouth.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.603
That's it.

16:19.687 --> 16:23.273
I got to admit, I was hoping
she'd be out here when we pulled up,

16:23.358 --> 16:25.776
tell us that the spirits
told her that we were coming.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.027
Have you been drug tested lately?

16:27.111 --> 16:28.528
You didn't even open the file, did you?

16:28.613 --> 16:29.863
I have a lot on my mind.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.156
Yeah. You hide it well.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.825
This woman has got 17 fraud arrests.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.828
Plus, the LPD's
investigating a series of recent burglaries

16:36.954 --> 16:38.747
at the homes of several of her clients.

16:38.831 --> 16:39.998
What does that mean, "clients"?

16:41.459 --> 16:43.377
- Don't tell me why you're here.
- Ma'am?

16:43.628 --> 16:45.837
The reason might be
different than what you think,

16:45.922 --> 16:48.131
and I don't want you to confuse my reading.

16:48.216 --> 16:49.383
Well, actually, ma'am, I'm Deputy Marshal...

16:49.467 --> 16:51.343
Didn't I just say not to tell me?

16:51.427 --> 16:52.636
Yes.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.763
Please, come in.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.890
She's a psychic.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.475
A certified spiritualist.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.811
Certified by who?

17:01.562 --> 17:03.855
Y'all familiar with psychometry...

17:04.022 --> 17:06.900
Extra-sensory perception
through physical contact?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.151
I saw a movie once

17:08.277 --> 17:10.153
where Walken shakes Martin Sheen's hand,

17:10.238 --> 17:11.780
sees him start World War III.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.031
You're a sceptic.

17:13.156 --> 17:14.281
You get that a lot?

17:14.409 --> 17:17.661
I used to ask myself
all the time if these feelings I got were real.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.121
And you know what I finally realised?

17:19.247 --> 17:21.498
People don't come see me
because they want to make a connection

17:21.582 --> 17:22.749
with someone from the other side.

17:22.834 --> 17:25.252
They come to me for solace,
and that's what I give them.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.087
And they give you their life savings?

17:27.213 --> 17:28.755
That's why you're here.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.967
Because some ambitious prosecutor

17:32.093 --> 17:35.429
has decided yet again
to charge me with theft by deception.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.890
Actually, ma'am,
marshals don't investigate theft of any kind.

17:39.016 --> 17:42.269
We chase fugitives,
one of whom has led us here.

17:42.353 --> 17:44.354
You don't see him somewhere around us?

17:45.815 --> 17:47.190
Not so clearly.

17:47.316 --> 17:50.277
Surprising,
considering you used to be married to him.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.695
Oh, if you're looking for Bradley,

17:51.779 --> 17:54.614
then you should get a hold of that little
whore that works in his office.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.199
Shouldn't be hard to find her number...

17:56.284 --> 17:57.451
Just go in any men's room.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.244
It'll be scrawled on the wall.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.288
- Bradley's your husband?
- Ex-husband.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.540
We ain't looking for him.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.710
I don't understand.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.253
We're looking for your other husband.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.546
Former husband.

18:12.842 --> 18:13.967
Drew's dead.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.386
Well, you may be more
qualified to know that.

18:16.512 --> 18:20.348
All we know for certain
is his body didn't hit that street in Corbin.

18:20.892 --> 18:23.185
He may be dead some other way.

18:24.187 --> 18:26.605
Have you been
in touch with Drew in the last 30 years?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.900
Would you happen to have
any photos of him?

18:30.193 --> 18:31.234
No.

18:31.694 --> 18:32.944
Packed them all away.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.362
They got lost in one of the moves.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.865
Any reason to believe he could be alive?

18:38.201 --> 18:40.952
If he is, some bad people
are looking for him.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.954
First place they may come is here.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.876
I see so much death around you.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.378
Both of you.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.172
Ma'am, we don't have time for this.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.216
You're doing something later today,

18:54.300 --> 18:55.675
something you know you shouldn't.

18:55.760 --> 18:56.927
But you're gonna do it anyway.

18:57.053 --> 18:58.553
He does something stupid every day.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.347
Can you be a little more specific?

19:00.431 --> 19:03.225
You're meeting someone, someone bad.

19:03.434 --> 19:04.893
I meet bad people for a living.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.728
This is personal.

19:07.230 --> 19:10.565
Some... Weightlifter?

19:12.318 --> 19:13.610
Fighter?

19:13.903 --> 19:15.070
How'd you do that?

19:15.404 --> 19:16.571
What?

19:16.739 --> 19:18.365
I'm meeting Lindsey's ex-husband later.

19:18.449 --> 19:20.325
- Lindsey has an ex-husband?
- Apparently.

19:20.451 --> 19:22.410
- Where you meeting him?
- His gym.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.745
What gym?

19:23.830 --> 19:25.997
That boxing gym over on the east side.

19:26.082 --> 19:27.165
Showtime's at 6:00 p.m.

19:27.250 --> 19:28.416
Are we all finished here?

19:29.335 --> 19:30.418
What?

19:30.503 --> 19:32.003
He circled twice before he pulled in.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.797
Now he's just sitting there
with the motor off.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.006
Who's sitting where?

19:35.132 --> 19:37.133
Eve, you know that man?

19:38.469 --> 19:39.845
I've never seen him before.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.098
You got a room
in this house without windows?

19:43.224 --> 19:44.516
- Half-bath.
- Go there.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.059
It'll be all right.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.484
Let's think hard about the next few seconds.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.861
You want to live through them,

19:55.945 --> 19:59.781
you need to keep your hands out to the
side and do everything slow.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.450
You're Marshals Service, right?

20:02.535 --> 20:03.743
Hell of a guess.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.788
I'm FBI. I'm gonna
reach into the side of my coat for my creds.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.540
Hear that, Tim? He's gonna reach in his coat.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.542
Don't shoot him unless it seems appropriate.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.552
Badges.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.387
If I've seen one badge, I've seen a thousand.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.889
You don't mind if we call the FBI,

20:23.973 --> 20:26.057
make sure you didn't
get that out of a cereal box?

20:27.101 --> 20:28.226
Knock yourselves out.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.580
That what brought you out here,
change in an autopsy?

20:48.664 --> 20:50.498
Opposed to what...
I just happened to pick this morning

20:50.583 --> 20:53.168
to re-interview the widow of
a 30-year-dead fugitive?

20:53.252 --> 20:54.294
Ms Munro!

20:54.378 --> 20:55.962
Any chance while you're here, you'd tell us

20:56.047 --> 20:58.089
what Drew Thompson was
a material witness to?

20:58.174 --> 20:59.966
Ms Munro, false alarm.

21:00.051 --> 21:01.760
- I would if I knew.
- No, you wouldn't.

21:01.844 --> 21:04.095
No, I guess maybe I wouldn't.

21:04.889 --> 21:06.890
I thought you told her to lock herself in.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.789
Way to go, assholes.

21:30.873 --> 21:32.374
It's bullshit, Art.

21:32.458 --> 21:35.043
Just admit it.
You guys are hopeless without me.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.586
She stayed put for 30 years.

21:36.671 --> 21:39.130
We're supposed to assume she's gonna
choose today to go for the door?

21:39.256 --> 21:42.926
A good investigator assumes nothing
but observes everything.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.303
See, Art wouldn't let a little thing like

21:45.388 --> 21:47.639
an armed man coming
towards the house distract him.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.391
Well, maybe with a third set of eyes,

21:49.475 --> 21:52.435
you could've kept an eye on the armed man
and the suburban grandmother.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.853
She ain't a grandmother.

21:53.938 --> 21:55.397
Yeah, I know, but it sounds funnier.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.816
- Younger than you.
- Well, plus, she's got powers.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.818
- Jesus.
- Some kind of a gift.

22:01.904 --> 22:03.196
He wants to talk to you.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.572
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.742
This is Mullen.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.417
I don't think your boss likes us very much.

22:15.543 --> 22:17.544
Barkley?

22:18.004 --> 22:20.797
You're just saying that
because he tried to get the AUSA

22:20.881 --> 22:24.843
to prosecute Givens
for bribery and conspiracy.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.470
Really, I'm saying that
'cause he hung up on me

22:27.555 --> 22:29.014
without saying goodbye. It was rude.

22:29.140 --> 22:31.057
Guess the fact that your boys

22:31.142 --> 22:33.852
couldn't hold onto that suburban
housewife... That's not so good.

22:33.936 --> 22:35.437
They were doing fine until you showed up.

22:35.730 --> 22:36.813
What's that mean?

22:36.939 --> 22:38.231
Means we were handling it.

22:38.315 --> 22:41.192
Yeah. Well, now we're handling it.

22:41.402 --> 22:42.444
Hold on.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.154
You said the only reason you were here is

22:44.238 --> 22:46.698
'cause you had to follow up
when we changed the autopsy.

22:46.782 --> 22:49.909
That's right. But now I'm here...

22:50.536 --> 22:51.745
So I'll take it from here.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.621
Oh, I see. So we do all the work,

22:53.706 --> 22:56.374
and then you guys
just swoop in when it gets interesting.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.753
How many guys you got out looking for her?

23:00.129 --> 23:01.796
We're only interested in Thompson.

23:03.132 --> 23:05.633
She said she didn't know
where he was, right?

23:05.718 --> 23:08.344
Yeah. She also said
there were no windows in the half-bath.

23:08.846 --> 23:10.847
Just because she's running
doesn't mean she's running to him.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.016
What if she's not running?

23:13.100 --> 23:15.185
- Meaning what?
- Well, why leave the car?

23:16.103 --> 23:17.520
Same reason she left her phone...

23:17.605 --> 23:18.772
Because she knew we'd track her?

23:19.106 --> 23:20.148
Maybe.

23:20.858 --> 23:23.943
Like I said... We'll take it from here.

23:24.028 --> 23:27.906
The best thing you fellas can do...
Stay out of my way.

23:33.370 --> 23:36.331
I'm telling you. Something ain't right.

23:49.303 --> 23:50.345
Yeah?

23:50.429 --> 23:51.638
Any problems?

23:51.764 --> 23:52.889
Not so far.

23:53.891 --> 23:56.101
- She say anything?
- I ain't even there yet.

23:57.478 --> 24:00.105
Look, you know what happens
if we miss with Thompson, right?

24:00.189 --> 24:03.233
Yeah. You die badly.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.151
Not alone.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.986
Your family, too?

24:07.613 --> 24:09.697
Don't talk about my family.

24:09.824 --> 24:12.200
Well, tell you what.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.911
I'm-a make sure they go real fast, all right?

24:15.079 --> 24:18.414
Unfortunately,
I can't promise you the same thing.

24:18.749 --> 24:21.084
Call me as soon as you find anything.

24:44.525 --> 24:46.151
Alone at last.

25:05.421 --> 25:07.297
If I take this off and you scream,
I'm-a cut your tongue out.

25:07.423 --> 25:08.590
You believe me?

25:16.932 --> 25:18.474
Where's Drew?

25:19.768 --> 25:21.436
I don't know.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.027
Where's Drew?

25:29.528 --> 25:33.364
I swear, until an hour ago,
I thought he was dead.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.533
I swear. I swear.

25:43.626 --> 25:44.834
Now, I'm-a give you one more chance,

25:44.960 --> 25:47.128
and then I'm gonna
piss on that sock before I put it back.

25:47.630 --> 25:51.216
How do I know
you won't just kill me after you find him?

25:59.683 --> 26:02.810
You don't worry about
how long you gonna live.

26:03.062 --> 26:06.356
You worry about how slow you gonna die.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.483
Where is he?

26:14.240 --> 26:15.406
What the hell's this?

26:16.242 --> 26:19.244
Never mind that.
Where the hell have you been?

26:19.328 --> 26:22.330
Wasn't aware I was supposed to keep you
apprised of my comings and goings.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.666
- Mr Crowder?
- Yeah.

26:26.835 --> 26:29.712
I'd still like to get him to a hospital.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.006
I thought you said he was doing okay.

26:32.174 --> 26:34.175
Well, under the circumstances,
he's doing remarkably.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.386
Even if half his bites were dry,

26:36.512 --> 26:38.888
the amount of time
it took for him to get treatment...

26:39.014 --> 26:40.890
He should've been dead hours ago.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.024
The fella who uses this locker...

26:50.859 --> 26:51.943
Randall?

26:52.027 --> 26:53.069
Everybody knows Randall.

26:53.195 --> 26:55.363
I'm sure they do. But where is he?

26:55.698 --> 26:58.533
Right after you left the last time,
he packed up all his shit.

26:58.701 --> 27:01.286
He carried it out to his car.
Ain't seen him since.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.912
Was he scared when he was leaving?

27:03.038 --> 27:04.163
- How do you mean?
- I'm just kidding.

27:04.248 --> 27:05.373
Thanks, man.

27:06.208 --> 27:07.917
Yeah, it looks like bullshit.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.627
Well, I'll check it out anyway,

27:09.712 --> 27:11.212
- let you know if anything pans out.
- Barnes?

27:14.633 --> 27:16.092
Should've known.

27:16.218 --> 27:17.343
Should've known what?

27:17.428 --> 27:20.513
That you were bullshitting when you said
you didn't get anything from the widow.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.807
Just trying to keep from sharing the glory?

27:22.891 --> 27:24.600
- He in there?
- Who?

27:25.269 --> 27:27.562
Thompson. He in there?

27:28.480 --> 27:30.732
Drew Thompson? I doubt it.

27:32.276 --> 27:33.693
What are you doing here?

27:33.777 --> 27:35.653
Same thing you're doing...
Looking for Thompson.

27:37.406 --> 27:40.950
Because you got a tip?

27:42.578 --> 27:43.828
I'm standing here, right?

27:43.912 --> 27:45.288
From who?

27:47.958 --> 27:50.293
I'm here on personal business.

27:52.504 --> 27:56.090
Only people who knew I'd be here
is my partner and Eve Munro.

27:56.592 --> 27:58.468
Are you following me?

27:58.594 --> 28:02.138
I just told you I was sure you
were holding out on me, right?

28:03.515 --> 28:05.600
And that's gonna hold
when we pull your phone records,

28:05.684 --> 28:08.102
see who you've been speaking to?

28:10.689 --> 28:12.190
Only way to help yourself now

28:12.274 --> 28:15.318
is to tell us where your partners are
before they kill her.

28:16.445 --> 28:19.405
You know how many times
I've been on your side of this conversation?

28:19.490 --> 28:22.325
Then you know I'm shooting you straight.

28:25.287 --> 28:28.122
No. No, no. Don't do that.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.375
You'll notice the subject's weapon

28:30.459 --> 28:33.211
is not in a position to threaten the officer.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.465
You know what they do
to ex-lawmen in prison.

28:37.591 --> 28:39.801
Then you get yourself some protection.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.344
- My family...
- WITSEC.

28:41.428 --> 28:42.637
You don't know these people.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.348
I will if you tell me who they are.

28:49.186 --> 28:50.770
Where's Eve Munro?

28:50.854 --> 28:52.063
Tell my wife I'm sorry.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.564
You raise that weapon any further,

28:53.649 --> 28:55.441
I'm gonna shoot you in the leg.

28:55.526 --> 28:57.527
How about if
I swing my weapon in your direction?

28:57.611 --> 28:59.112
You still gonna risk a leg shot then?

28:59.196 --> 29:00.405
Maybe.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.365
You gonna risk looking your wife in the eye

29:02.449 --> 29:04.826
while you get arraigned in a hospital bed?

29:09.581 --> 29:11.332
Where's Eve Munro?

29:15.295 --> 29:16.421
Hillview Motel.

29:16.964 --> 29:18.131
Okay.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.854
I bet you think you're pretty funny, huh?

29:32.980 --> 29:34.230
Pretty smart?

29:35.357 --> 29:39.110
Bullshit address,
make me look like an asshole, huh?

29:46.660 --> 29:51.831
See, I don't give a shit what you do or what
you don't know any more.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.667
I'm-a hurt you just to make myself feel good

29:54.751 --> 29:56.127
about this whole thing.

29:58.630 --> 29:59.964
You can promise me things.

30:00.716 --> 30:02.341
You can beg for mercy.

30:03.218 --> 30:05.219
Oh, yeah. I'm-a like that.

30:05.345 --> 30:07.597
But it ain't gonna make a difference.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.099
There ain't a damn thing
you can do to change

30:10.184 --> 30:12.602
or stop what's about to happen to you.

30:16.315 --> 30:20.359
You might as well
just lay back and try to enjoy yourself.

30:22.029 --> 30:24.780
U.S. Marshals! Hands where I can see them!

30:25.199 --> 30:27.450
Get them up! Right now!

30:39.296 --> 30:42.131
Gentlemen, can we have
a few moments, please?

30:43.634 --> 30:45.885
Ma'am, I am Chief Deputy Art Mullen.

30:46.011 --> 30:47.887
The man who was holding you

30:48.013 --> 30:50.932
was a Detroit hard case
named Mason Goines,

30:51.016 --> 30:52.975
and he worked for a man named Theo Tonin.

30:53.769 --> 30:56.270
Can I assume you know who that is?

30:56.355 --> 30:57.438
Might ring a bell.

30:57.898 --> 31:00.441
Well, I'm not really all that concerned about

31:00.526 --> 31:02.276
whether or not you know his name.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.570
I'm really interested in how he knows you.

31:04.738 --> 31:06.822
As I told your officers earlier...

31:06.907 --> 31:07.990
Deputies.

31:08.075 --> 31:09.408
As I told your deputies earlier...

31:09.493 --> 31:11.244
Before you ran out the back?

31:11.411 --> 31:12.662
I was abducted.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.205
From the bathroom?

31:15.332 --> 31:18.960
Ms Munro, this is how this is gonna go.

31:19.044 --> 31:22.547
Soon as the medics say you're okay,
we're gonna send you home.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.382
As long as we feel like you're cooperating,

31:24.466 --> 31:26.300
we're gonna leave
somebody there to protect you.

31:27.594 --> 31:29.679
And if you don't feel I'm cooperating?

31:29.805 --> 31:33.391
Then we'll wish you good luck,
and we'll be on our way.

31:37.312 --> 31:40.565
One night, after Johnny Carson,

31:40.691 --> 31:43.192
I go and find Drew in the yard...

31:44.152 --> 31:45.903
And he's burning all our photos.

31:45.988 --> 31:47.572
I ask him, "What the hell?"

31:47.656 --> 31:51.158
And he tells me
that the next day or the day after,

31:51.243 --> 31:55.538
someone will be coming by
to say that he was dead and that...

31:56.498 --> 31:59.667
As far as I was concerned, he would be.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.252
So that's it?

32:01.378 --> 32:04.463
He just said that
he was gonna be gone, and...

32:05.340 --> 32:06.549
Never explained anything.

32:06.633 --> 32:07.675
You didn't ask him any questions.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.802
Of course I asked him questions.

32:09.886 --> 32:14.223
All he'd say was,
not knowing was gonna keep me safe.

32:16.476 --> 32:17.852
Well, that sounds like bullshit.

32:18.437 --> 32:21.272
I mean, he obviously
witnessed something big enough

32:21.356 --> 32:22.857
that made him want to fake his own death

32:22.941 --> 32:24.984
and leave his whole life behind,

32:25.068 --> 32:27.486
and you don't know shit about it?

32:29.406 --> 32:30.990
Well, what if I tell you something now

32:31.074 --> 32:33.743
that I didn't tell
the investigators 30 years ago?

32:33.952 --> 32:35.620
It could be something you just forgot.

32:36.204 --> 32:39.373
Or maybe it's something
you just picked up today,

32:39.458 --> 32:43.252
when this Goines fella
was smashing you in the face.

32:44.046 --> 32:45.921
- Psycho-plasm.
- Psychometry.

32:46.006 --> 32:47.340
There you go.

32:55.349 --> 33:00.770
Drew saw Theo Tonin
murder a government informant.

33:01.063 --> 33:03.522
We've got to assume
Barnes told Theo everything we know.

33:03.607 --> 33:05.858
He's gonna send an army after Drew.

33:05.942 --> 33:07.818
- Getting a little stiff?
- A little bit.

33:08.570 --> 33:10.196
Ms Munro, I'm gonna take you home.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.114
I'm gonna station two men
out your front door,

33:12.199 --> 33:14.241
two men out your back door, and two inside.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.368
I think that'll do the job.

33:15.452 --> 33:17.787
Can I just ask one last question?

33:17.871 --> 33:19.080
How did you know where to send him?

33:19.873 --> 33:20.998
What? What do you mean?

33:21.249 --> 33:23.834
I just said a boxing gym
over on the east side.

33:23.919 --> 33:26.796
There are three over there.
How'd you know which one?

33:26.880 --> 33:29.173
I told you. I have a gift.

33:31.551 --> 33:33.260
Praise God in Jesus' name!

33:33.345 --> 33:34.970
- Amen!
- Amen!

33:35.055 --> 33:36.514
Praise God.

33:38.517 --> 33:41.102
Church, I have a story to tell this evening.

33:41.687 --> 33:46.732
Now, I was taught
that the reason we handle serpents

33:47.401 --> 33:50.695
is because by protecting us
from their poison...

33:51.613 --> 33:54.281
- He reveals his glory. Amen.
- Amen!

33:55.033 --> 33:58.244
But, church, last night,
a devil entered this place.

33:58.328 --> 34:01.789
And it was through these very
serpents that the Lord cast him out!

34:02.749 --> 34:05.418
It was through these very serpents,

34:06.044 --> 34:07.712
- that he sheltered me.
- Amen!

34:17.179 --> 34:18.973
Church...

34:19.056 --> 34:22.268
It seems only fitting
that just now, as I spoke of devils,

34:22.351 --> 34:25.103
Boyd Crowder appeared in our midst,

34:25.188 --> 34:29.442
for it was Boyd Crowder whose assassins
the Lord turned away last night.

34:29.525 --> 34:32.235
I'd be more inclined to call them angels.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.362
Blasphemy.

34:33.447 --> 34:38.117
Dark angels sent here
to remind you that all men are human.

34:38.201 --> 34:39.243
Well, you know, Mr Crowder,

34:39.327 --> 34:43.873
I'd hoped that the bribe
you offered my sister last night

34:43.956 --> 34:46.083
that she rejected would've been sufficient.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.960
But it appears the Lord sees fit

34:49.045 --> 34:50.755
to remind us of the persistence of evil.

34:50.839 --> 34:52.505
This ain't a bribe, Billy.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.007
It's a gift.

34:54.134 --> 34:55.384
Well, as you well know, Mr Crowder,

34:55.469 --> 34:56.927
this church no longer accepts donations.

34:57.012 --> 34:58.262
Well, this gift ain't to the church.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.431
It's to the congregation.

35:01.057 --> 35:04.310
And it ain't money. It's knowledge.

35:04.603 --> 35:08.063
Now, this here, in this box,

35:08.857 --> 35:10.649
is a genuine canebrake rattler

35:10.734 --> 35:13.027
pulled this very day from a rock crevice

35:13.111 --> 35:14.904
alongside the Cumberland river,

35:14.988 --> 35:17.156
which is how I know
your sister hadn't had a chance to milk it

35:17.240 --> 35:19.533
like she has all these other snakes.

35:19.659 --> 35:20.701
That's blasphemy!

35:20.827 --> 35:22.161
Once again, Mr Crowder,

35:22.245 --> 35:27.416
I am amazed at the ease
with which lies drip from your forked tongue.

35:29.336 --> 35:33.798
Well, if I'm lying,
you won't mind taking a hold of this bad boy.

35:34.800 --> 35:38.677
Mr Crowder,
these serpents are not props to us.

35:39.554 --> 35:42.306
We take them up only when
the Lord moves us,

35:42.432 --> 35:44.934
and then it's only in pursuit of his glory.

35:45.018 --> 35:48.145
Well, how you think
that's gonna play with the flock, Billy, huh?

35:48.230 --> 35:50.064
How say you, flock?

35:52.609 --> 35:56.487
Now, there are those men
who choose to stay in the dark.

35:56.571 --> 36:00.449
But there are some men
who choose to come out into the light.

36:00.575 --> 36:03.953
And those men should be transparent.

36:05.956 --> 36:09.416
All right, Mr Crowder.
I will indulge your sideshow.

36:10.544 --> 36:13.712
"For it is not with words that I preach,

36:13.797 --> 36:17.132
"but with a demonstration
of the spirit's power."

36:17.551 --> 36:18.634
Amen!

36:20.095 --> 36:21.595
You gonna have to tell him.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.515
This is your last chance.

36:25.392 --> 36:28.060
Billy. Don't.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.190
Don't.

36:43.743 --> 36:45.619
- No, it's not possible.
- Sure it is.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.455
You just jam the fangs
right down on the funnel,

36:48.540 --> 36:51.417
and you press right behind the eyes.

36:52.127 --> 36:54.795
No, I... I would've known.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.630
Billy, come here. Come here.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.552
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:01.636 --> 37:04.305
You weren't there when Daddy died.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.015
You didn't have to listen to him scream

37:06.099 --> 37:08.726
as the poison ate out his insides.

37:10.395 --> 37:13.522
Well, I think we've seen all we needed to see.

37:16.943 --> 37:18.777
You set that box down, Mr Crowder.

37:18.862 --> 37:20.571
- Billy.
- Mr Crowder!

37:20.655 --> 37:21.906
Billy!

37:22.908 --> 37:24.992
You may have started this game,

37:25.076 --> 37:27.369
but you do not get to say when it is over.

37:30.373 --> 37:31.665
You know what, son?

37:31.833 --> 37:34.251
I once stood where you're standing now,

37:34.377 --> 37:36.420
mistaking my own hubris for God's touch.

37:36.504 --> 37:41.175
That ain't religion, son.
That's called self-glorification.

37:41.301 --> 37:43.510
Best you leave this one alone.

37:45.305 --> 37:46.764
Put it down.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.069
Billy, don't.

38:00.737 --> 38:03.238
Don't do it, son.
You ain't got nothing to be ashamed of.

38:03.323 --> 38:06.283
I will not heed the warning of an idolater.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.958
Billy. Billy, don't!

38:14.042 --> 38:15.209
Let go of me.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.835
Please, Billy, no. God, no.

38:19.589 --> 38:21.173
Yes. Come on.

38:22.926 --> 38:25.928
Oh, yes. Oh, there it is.

38:31.351 --> 38:33.936
Hallelujah! Praise Jesus!

38:36.940 --> 38:41.944
The righteous man knows his only true
protection comes from the Lord!

38:45.365 --> 38:46.573
Billy!

38:52.247 --> 38:54.039
Billy! Billy!

38:54.749 --> 38:55.958
Billy!

38:57.293 --> 38:58.460
What's going on?

38:58.545 --> 38:59.837
Billy...

39:00.547 --> 39:01.630
Stay with me.

39:01.715 --> 39:03.799
Please, stay with me. No.

39:04.592 --> 39:06.343
Somebody please call an ambulance!

39:09.472 --> 39:11.849
Somebody call an ambulance now!

39:39.461 --> 39:43.255
You remember what
Michael Jordan said about weakness?

39:43.339 --> 39:46.383
I remember when he dunked
on the tallest fella I ever saw.

39:46.468 --> 39:48.844
His name was like "Micron" or something.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.137
Manute.

39:50.263 --> 39:52.431
There you go. Yeah.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.725
What's the chances
you name your boy "Minute"

39:54.809 --> 39:57.519
and he ends up nearly 8 feet tall?

39:58.938 --> 40:00.564
I left Joe.

40:01.357 --> 40:04.276
Sorry to hear that. Seemed like a decent guy.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.028
He is.

40:11.534 --> 40:12.910
Is this where I'm supposed to ask

40:12.994 --> 40:14.036
if you want to talk about it?

40:15.288 --> 40:17.831
Thank God. I thought you were
gonna want to talk about it.

40:20.794 --> 40:23.378
- So, did you find him?
- Find who?

40:23.505 --> 40:26.131
Tim said you went there
looking for your girl's ex-husband.

40:26.216 --> 40:28.717
Yeah. I saw him there this morning.

40:28.802 --> 40:31.261
Told him he'd best
not be there when I get back.

40:31.346 --> 40:34.181
You mean you told him to meet you
behind the bleachers after school?

40:34.265 --> 40:35.307
Pretty much.

40:39.687 --> 40:40.729
What?

40:42.315 --> 40:44.274
I would've bet money he would be there.

40:44.359 --> 40:45.859
Seemed like he couldn't wait.

40:48.321 --> 40:49.613
Lindsey ain't here tonight?

40:49.739 --> 40:52.157
Last I saw her,
she was headed up to wait for you.

40:52.242 --> 40:53.992
That was a couple hours ago.

41:24.566 --> 41:26.900
Guess she got tired of waiting.
