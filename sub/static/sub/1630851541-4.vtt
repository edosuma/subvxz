WEBVTT

00:11.185 --> 00:15.319
- Mm.
- Yeah.

00:15.363 --> 00:18.061
- Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah.

00:18.105 --> 00:20.846
Oh, yes, yes!

00:20.890 --> 00:23.066
He's got nothing.
No chance!

00:23.110 --> 00:25.155
- Yeah.
- He's got nowhere to put it.

00:25.199 --> 00:28.071
- No, no, he's out.
- He's done, he's done.

00:28.115 --> 00:31.074
That's what I thought.
- Hold on, hold on.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.731
- Oh, oh.

00:39.126 --> 00:42.042
- Okay.
- Come on, yeah.

00:42.085 --> 00:45.523
- Come on, Terry.
- Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah.

00:45.567 --> 00:46.916
- I think he's done.

00:46.959 --> 00:48.178
- Oh.

00:48.222 --> 00:51.051
- No, no, no.
He's done.

00:52.269 --> 00:54.184
- Yeah!

00:54.228 --> 00:57.361
- Yeah, I'll never let you
forget this, Terry McConky!

00:57.405 --> 01:00.016
Never!

01:02.236 --> 01:05.195
All right, crank up
the Foreigner.

01:36.270 --> 01:38.576
- Hey, welcome to
"Hook and Chatter."

01:38.620 --> 01:42.580
The TFD sports podcast.
Episode eight.

01:42.624 --> 01:45.235
- This podcast is brought
to you by Alohair,

01:45.279 --> 01:47.933
The number two
of two Hawaiian-themed

01:47.977 --> 01:49.587
waxing salons in Tacoma.

01:49.631 --> 01:52.416
From eyebrows to low brows,
our deals are so good

01:52.460 --> 01:55.463
you'd be macadamia nuts
not to come by.

01:55.506 --> 01:57.247
<i>
- Ha ha!</i>

01:57.291 --> 02:00.294
First topic, LeBron, Kobe,
Michael Jordan.

02:00.337 --> 02:02.165
Who's the best of all time?

02:02.209 --> 02:03.949
- None of those guys!

02:03.993 --> 02:06.300
It's Dirk Nowitzki,
and I'll tell you guys why.

02:06.343 --> 02:08.302
- Wait, what?
- Nowitzki?

02:08.345 --> 02:10.434
You're crazy, man.
What are you talking about?

02:10.478 --> 02:12.262
- I'm trying out a new persona.

02:12.306 --> 02:14.003
The guy with the hot takes,
the contrarian?

02:14.046 --> 02:16.440
- You sound crazy.
- How do podcasts make money?

02:16.484 --> 02:18.007
- Computer, the--
- Ads.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.617
How do you get ads?
- Having content that is--

02:19.661 --> 02:21.619
- By getting subscribers.
How do you get subscribers?

02:21.663 --> 02:24.013
- From TV.

02:24.056 --> 02:26.450
- Contrarianism, hot takes.

02:26.494 --> 02:29.279
You know, thinking outrageously
outside of the box.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.151
- Bickering creates
a fun dynamic.

02:31.194 --> 02:32.630
- Yeah, slamming people's
good too, right?

02:32.674 --> 02:34.284
Especially if they
don't deserve it.

02:34.328 --> 02:35.807
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:35.851 --> 02:38.288
- Hey, we should
all be hot take guys.

02:38.332 --> 02:39.289
- That sounds great.
- Yeah!

02:39.333 --> 02:41.161
- No, no, no.
- Ike.

02:41.204 --> 02:43.641
- I'm just kidding, guys.
I'm being contrarian.

02:43.685 --> 02:46.644
I'm being a hot take guy.
That's what you do, right?

02:46.688 --> 02:48.298
- And we're back.

02:48.342 --> 02:49.865
- Nowitzki?
Are you crazy?

02:49.908 --> 02:51.649
He's only got
one championship.

02:51.693 --> 02:53.303
- It doesn't matter.

02:53.347 --> 02:55.479
I believe he's the best,
and here is why.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.002
First of all, he's German.

02:57.046 --> 02:58.221
How do you get better
than Germans?

03:00.876 --> 03:02.834
- Are we really
buying a boat together?

03:02.878 --> 03:04.836
- Yeah, you know it.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.229
Look at this baby, huh?

03:06.273 --> 03:08.492
- Mm, I've always wanted
a boat.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.190
- I came up
with a great name for it.

03:10.233 --> 03:12.366
<i>The Hook, Line and Sphincter.</i>

03:12.409 --> 03:14.324
- Why is it always
dirty with you?

03:14.368 --> 03:16.326
- What are you talking about?
The name is hysterical.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.502
- Why don't we try something
like, uh, like <i>Laurels</i>

03:18.546 --> 03:19.851
'cause that's what
we're resting on.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.549
Our laurels. <i>
The Laurel.</i>

03:21.592 --> 03:23.333
- Come on, Terry,
live a little.

03:23.377 --> 03:25.205
Boat names are supposed
to be naughty puns, okay?

03:25.248 --> 03:27.337
I got another one, <i>
The Glory Hull.</i>

03:27.381 --> 03:28.860
- Ugh.
- Huh? Hmm?

03:28.904 --> 03:30.253
- Gross.
- You don't know.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.212
- How about <i>
The Terry Cruise?</i>

03:32.255 --> 03:33.517
- You wanna name your boat
after an actor?

03:33.561 --> 03:35.040
- What actor?
- Terry Crews.

03:35.084 --> 03:37.042
It's Tom Cruise, sweetie.

03:37.086 --> 03:39.697
And it's a pun.
Terry cruise.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.917
- Never mind.
- Ugh, you're so dumb.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.049
- I think it should
be a fun pun.

03:44.093 --> 03:45.399
<i>Yacht-Sea.</i>

03:45.442 --> 03:48.358
Do you get it? <i>
Yacht-Sea.</i>

03:48.402 --> 03:51.056
- Yeah. Yeah, no, we got it.
S-E-A, right.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.363
- Um, Vicky.
- Yes.

03:53.407 --> 03:54.538
- Eddie and I
are buying the boat.

03:54.582 --> 03:56.540
- Mm-hmm.
- So that means Eddie and I

03:56.584 --> 03:58.281
are gonna name the boat.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.109
- Oh, I'm sorry.

04:00.152 --> 04:03.286
Is it your name on
the bank account or our name?

04:03.330 --> 04:05.375
Because if we're both
going to buy the boat,

04:05.419 --> 04:07.377
we both can name it, okay?

04:07.421 --> 04:09.292
- Owned.

04:09.336 --> 04:10.424
- All right, let's just
come up with a name

04:10.467 --> 04:12.295
we can all agree on.

04:12.339 --> 04:14.558
- I got another one.
Two firefighters on the ocean.

04:14.602 --> 04:17.909
Let's call the boat <i>Hot Sem--</i>

04:17.953 --> 04:19.259
<i>
- Next up,</i>

04:19.302 --> 04:21.391
tonight's MMA heavyweight
title fight

04:21.435 --> 04:24.264
just so happens to be
at our very own Tacoma Dome!

04:24.307 --> 04:25.439
- Bah!

04:25.482 --> 04:29.138
Champion Stipe Miocic
versus challenger

04:29.181 --> 04:31.401
Bobby Ferapolis.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.098
Stipe is considered
the greatest

04:33.142 --> 04:34.578
heavyweight of our time.

04:34.622 --> 04:36.580
How do you like his chances?

04:36.624 --> 04:38.278
- I give him no chance.

04:38.321 --> 04:41.411
I think he's gonna get KO'd
in round three.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.283
I mean, he's clearly
lost his step,

04:43.326 --> 04:46.286
and his footwork is a mess.

04:46.329 --> 04:48.113
- I'm gonna go one step
further here, fellas.

04:48.157 --> 04:50.638
I say he gets knocked out
in round two.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.161
- Oh!

04:52.204 --> 04:53.771
- Guys, Stipe
is so predictable.

04:53.815 --> 04:56.426
All he does is leg kick,
leg kick, leg kick, leg kick.

04:56.470 --> 04:57.514
Maybe after he gets
knocked out,

04:57.558 --> 04:59.342
he can get a job
with the Rockettes.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.126
both: Oh!

05:01.170 --> 05:02.606
- I'll do you one better
and say

05:02.650 --> 05:03.955
he gets knocked out
in round one

05:03.999 --> 05:06.001
'cause he's over the hill.

05:06.044 --> 05:08.133
- I bet I could
beat him up too.

05:08.177 --> 05:09.483
- I heard he's
a terrible father.

05:09.526 --> 05:12.790
<i>
- Yeah.</i>

05:12.834 --> 05:14.792
- Eddie, I don't wanna have to
register as a sexual predator

05:14.836 --> 05:16.185
because of the name
of the boat.

05:16.228 --> 05:18.361
- All your name ideas blow.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.450
<i>Fishy Business?
Come on, dude.</i>

05:20.494 --> 05:23.018
- How about we call it <i>
Shrimp My Ride,</i>

05:23.061 --> 05:25.150
'cause you're such a shrimp?

05:25.194 --> 05:26.674
- I'd actually be okay
with that

05:26.717 --> 05:28.458
because it would be a constant
reminder of the time

05:28.502 --> 05:30.199
I crushed you in that shrimp
cocktail eating contest.

05:30.242 --> 05:33.376
- What? You never beat me
eating anything.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.683
- I did beat you, Terry,
right here in this very spot.

05:35.726 --> 05:37.467
And I remember 'cause
it was the same day

05:37.511 --> 05:38.816
you went on your first date
with Vicky.

05:38.860 --> 05:41.210
- Oh, right.
- I don't think I've ever heard

05:41.253 --> 05:42.472
the full story
about your first date.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.387
- Sure you have.
Eddie set us up as a prank.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.997
- No, I know that part,

05:46.041 --> 05:47.651
but I've just heard
like bits and pieces.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.218
- Well, Eddie thought we didn't
have anything in common,

05:49.261 --> 05:51.176
but as usual,
Eddie was wrong.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.353
He also forgot we almost went
on a few dates in high school.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.833
- Ehh, I'm not so sure
about that, honey.

05:55.877 --> 05:58.488
- No, I'm sure we did.
- Uh, no. Nope.

05:58.532 --> 06:00.185
That didn't really happen.
- I'm positive.

06:00.229 --> 06:02.405
- Oh, my God.
Your memory sucks, dude.

06:02.449 --> 06:03.667
- I wanna hear the full story.
Come on.

06:03.711 --> 06:05.190
- Okay. Okay.

06:05.234 --> 06:06.844
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

06:06.888 --> 06:09.673
It was before Jimmy Bleeder
opened Bleeder's Steakhouse.

06:09.717 --> 06:11.414
He had another restaurant
called Pounders

06:11.458 --> 06:12.676
where you order food
by the pound.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.417
- Ugh.
- It was pretty good.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.376
Well, that night
I got there early,

06:16.419 --> 06:18.378
<i>and I was looking
pretty sharp, </i>

06:18.421 --> 06:20.510
<i>but I had some
major butterflies. </i>

06:20.554 --> 06:23.252
<i>So I ordered a pound of onion
rings to settle my stomach. </i>

06:23.295 --> 06:24.558
<i>And that's when I saw Vicky,</i>

06:24.601 --> 06:27.212
<i>and she looked incredible.</i>

06:27.256 --> 06:28.431
<i>- Of course,
she looked incredible. </i>

06:28.475 --> 06:30.215
<i>She's a Penisi.</i>

06:30.259 --> 06:33.523
<i>- It took her a while
to see me. </i>

06:33.567 --> 06:35.743
<i>But when she did,
the sparks flew. </i>

06:35.786 --> 06:40.530
<i>And I gotta tell you,
I made all the right moves. </i>

06:40.574 --> 06:42.706
<i>I was suave.</i>

06:42.750 --> 06:44.404
<i>I was charming.</i>

06:44.447 --> 06:47.232
<i>I was sophisticated.</i>

06:47.276 --> 06:51.106
<i>Everything was perfect,
including the cuisine. </i>

06:54.326 --> 06:56.241
We had a great time,
except for the butterflies.

06:56.285 --> 06:57.721
They got the best of me.

06:57.765 --> 06:59.723
<i>She ended up
taking care of me, </i>

06:59.767 --> 07:02.247
<i>and that's when I knew
she was the one. </i>

07:02.291 --> 07:05.729
<i>We went on six dates
in three weeks. </i>

07:05.773 --> 07:07.557
And the rest is history.

07:07.601 --> 07:09.472
- That doesn't sound
like a prank at all.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.431
Sounds like Uncle Eddie
killed it.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.563
- Yeah, well, I'm glad you
believe in fairytales, Lucy,

07:13.607 --> 07:15.565
but that's not
how it went down.

07:15.609 --> 07:18.742
Let me tell you
what really happened.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.483
- That was the best
podcast so far.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.485
I bet you we double
our subscribers after this.

07:22.529 --> 07:23.791
- Cha-chingo!

07:23.834 --> 07:25.749
- It is out in the world.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.490
- That fast?
- Oh, baby.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.797
- Oh.
- Hi. I'm Rosa Roberts.

07:29.840 --> 07:33.278
I work with Stipe Miocic,
the UFC fighter.

07:35.150 --> 07:38.762
- Yeah, and I am the monster
from "Stranger Things," hi.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.764
- And I'm the Masked Singer.

07:40.808 --> 07:43.114
- Yeah, and I am
the professor--

07:43.158 --> 07:45.769
Hall of famer Willie Mays.

07:45.813 --> 07:49.120
- How can we help you?
- I handle PR for Stipe.

07:49.164 --> 07:52.515
You may not know this,
but when he's not throwing down

07:52.559 --> 07:54.604
in the ring,
he's a firefighter.

07:54.648 --> 07:58.608
And when he travels, he likes
to visit local fire stations.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.349
He's outside in the car.

08:00.392 --> 08:01.959
- Okay.

08:02.003 --> 08:04.527
- Okay, who put you up to this?
Was it Jiménez?

08:04.571 --> 08:05.963
- Classic Jiménez.
- Yeah, I'm sure he's still

08:06.007 --> 08:07.530
mad at us
about those murder hornets.

08:10.402 --> 08:12.622
- Hey-yo!
- Holy shit.

08:12.666 --> 08:15.495
- What's up Station 24?

08:16.583 --> 08:18.149
- Stipe.

08:18.193 --> 08:19.629
- Granny.
- Stipe.

08:19.673 --> 08:21.675
- Kaponko Myawani.
You can call me Andy.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.807
- Stipe.
- Stipe.

08:23.851 --> 08:26.810
- Ha, that's cute.
And you are Stipe too?

08:26.854 --> 08:28.638
- Yeah--no.
Well--

08:28.682 --> 08:31.206
- Anyway, you guys--
beautiful station.

08:31.249 --> 08:34.644
- Stipe, look,
they have a podcast.

08:34.688 --> 08:37.517
"Hook and Chatter."
I love it.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.649
We've got approximately
23 minutes

08:39.693 --> 08:41.825
if you want Stipe
to do a drop.

08:41.869 --> 08:44.001
- Nah.
- That's not necessary.

08:44.045 --> 08:46.177
- Ugh. I love podcasts.
I have my own.

08:46.221 --> 08:48.528
It's called
"Stipe or Not Stipe."

08:48.571 --> 08:52.357
Kinda like Shakespeare.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.011
So what do you guys
talk about?

08:54.055 --> 08:55.839
- Nothing.
- Sports.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.537
- Ah! Sports!

08:57.580 --> 08:59.669
Dude, let's do it.
I'm an athlete. Perfect.

08:59.713 --> 09:01.018
- No, don't worry about it.

09:01.062 --> 09:02.672
- Yeah, you don't wanna
waste your time.

09:02.716 --> 09:04.674
- Stipe has millions
of followers.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.546
It'll boost
your podcast instantly.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.591
- Still, no thanks.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.550
- Do you not know
how podcasts make money?

09:10.593 --> 09:12.856
- Is it from subscribers
and subscribers

09:12.900 --> 09:14.684
or is it because
of contrarianism?

09:14.728 --> 09:16.599
- Seriously,
I would love to do it.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.209
- Let's take some pics,

09:18.253 --> 09:20.385
record the podcast,
and get going.

09:20.429 --> 09:23.693
- Awesome.
- Okay, cool.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.782
- We gotta delete the podcast.
- I know.

09:29.743 --> 09:32.702
- Lucy, the Penisis
are legendary pranksters.

09:32.746 --> 09:33.703
Vicky and I have been
going head to head

09:33.747 --> 09:35.444
since we were kids.

09:35.487 --> 09:36.880
- You remember that time
I made you believe

09:36.924 --> 09:38.926
you were gonna be
on the "Wheel of Fortune?

09:40.623 --> 09:41.624
- I was 12.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.060
- Oh, what an idiot.

09:43.104 --> 09:45.280
- But anyway,
with this prank,

09:45.323 --> 09:47.717
I came up with the prank
to end all pranks.

09:47.761 --> 09:52.722
<i>I was gonna set Vicky up with
the biggest buffoon I knew, </i>

09:52.766 --> 09:54.637
<i>Terrence Leslie McConky.</i>

09:58.467 --> 10:00.948
<i>And he was perfect.</i>

10:00.991 --> 10:03.472
<i>I told him I wanted
to hook him up with my sister, </i>

10:03.515 --> 10:06.257
<i>and he was so excited.</i>

10:06.301 --> 10:09.652
<i>So excited he even touched
my hair, which is a no-no. </i>

10:09.696 --> 10:12.655
And that's when part two
of my plan came into play.

10:12.699 --> 10:15.310
<i>So the day of a date,
I challenged Terry </i>

10:15.353 --> 10:16.964
<i>to a shrimp
cocktail-eating contest </i>

10:17.007 --> 10:19.923
<i>knowing that a gut full
of shrimp would make him </i>

10:19.967 --> 10:22.273
<i>even more unappealing
than he already was. </i>

10:22.317 --> 10:24.754
- No, hold on.
That did not happen.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.930
- Oh, yes, it did.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.932
<i>- So Vicky got
to the restaurant, </i>

10:28.976 --> 10:30.673
<i>and she was looking around
for the guy </i>

10:30.717 --> 10:33.763
<i>she thought
I was setting her up with. </i>

10:33.807 --> 10:37.811
<i>And when she saw Terry,
she looked like she ate a bug. </i>

10:37.854 --> 10:39.464
<i>- Hold on.</i>

10:39.508 --> 10:40.683
How do you know
how she looked?

10:40.727 --> 10:42.511
- I was there.
- Bullshit.

10:42.554 --> 10:43.947
- I was.

10:43.991 --> 10:45.775
<i>And I was looking real good,</i>

10:45.819 --> 10:48.125
<i>with the clothes,
the mustache, </i>

10:48.169 --> 10:52.347
<i>the drink, the hair,
but none of that mattered, </i>

10:52.390 --> 10:54.479
<i>'cause once that
shrimp cocktail kicked in, </i>

10:54.523 --> 10:57.787
<i>all hell broke loose.</i>

11:06.840 --> 11:07.884
- I did not puke.

11:07.928 --> 11:10.017
- Yes, you did.
Vicky, back me up.

11:10.060 --> 11:11.801
- Yeah, you puked.
- Ba-boom!

11:11.845 --> 11:13.498
- All right,
maybe I got a little bit sick,

11:13.542 --> 11:14.717
but Eddie was not there

11:14.761 --> 11:16.371
and I did not lose
a shrimp-eating contest.

11:16.414 --> 11:17.807
- I don't understand.

11:17.851 --> 11:18.852
Why would you do that
to your friend?

11:18.895 --> 11:20.331
- We weren't friends.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.550
- What did you say?

11:21.593 --> 11:23.813
- We weren't friends.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.992
- And this is
our briefing room.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.820
- Looks just like
my briefing room.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.996
This is where your chief
stands and says,

11:33.040 --> 11:34.998
"Do I make myself clear?"

11:35.042 --> 11:37.348
- That's it.
- I love it. Exactly.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.524
- That's exactly
how he does it every time.

11:39.568 --> 11:40.743
- Should we follow you,
Granny?

11:40.787 --> 11:44.007
- No, I'm just going
to the bathroom.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.836
- Perfect, it's a good time
for Stipe to go too.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.708
- Ooh, good idea.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.013
- Then we'll do the podcast
and get going.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.841
- To the bathroom.
Hey, when we leave...

11:51.885 --> 11:53.756
- You guys gotta delete this.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.018
- But I don't know
how to do that.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.759
- I don't know how
to do it either.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.195
- Yo, Granny, come on,
nature calls.

11:58.239 --> 12:01.851
Whoo-yeah!

12:01.895 --> 12:04.854
- Went to our first Mariners
game together in seventh grade.

12:04.898 --> 12:06.726
- It was a school field trip.
There were like 200 kids there.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.205
- You were the best man
at my wedding.

12:08.249 --> 12:10.033
- Family obligation.
Vicky kinda made me.

12:10.077 --> 12:11.556
- Oh, come on Uncle Eddie.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.080
I've heard plenty of stories
of you guys,

12:13.123 --> 12:15.038
and they all sound like
the premise of a buddy film.

12:15.082 --> 12:17.040
- Name one.
- "Bad Boys,"

12:17.084 --> 12:19.782
"Beverly Hills Cop,"
"Lethal Weapon."

12:19.826 --> 12:21.871
- You're not dumb, are you?
You're joking, right?

12:21.915 --> 12:24.787
- He saved your life.
- And I lost a nut doing it.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.571
- Yes, and while I feel
your pain there,

12:26.615 --> 12:27.877
that still didn't
make us friends.

12:27.921 --> 12:30.053
- Okay, fine. We're not buying
a boat together.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.576
- Fine.
- Fine.

12:31.620 --> 12:34.057
- Fine.
- Fine.

12:34.101 --> 12:38.061
- Hey, just got to clear
some space for memory.

12:38.105 --> 12:39.802
- Better, man.
I could talk all day.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.892
- Yeah, Stipe uses up
mad gigabytes.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.938
- Friends call me "Mr. Gigs."
- Oh.

12:44.981 --> 12:46.591
- For all the mad gigabytes
I use.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.071
- There it is.

12:48.115 --> 12:50.595
What needed to be deleted
is deleted.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.075
- So you cleared up the memory?
- I did.

12:52.119 --> 12:54.817
- All the memories
have been deleted.

12:54.861 --> 12:58.255
- We are good.
- Yeah.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.910
- Wow, man, you guys are
serious about your drive space.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.607
- Yeah.
- All right, let's do this!

13:04.479 --> 13:06.089
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

13:06.133 --> 13:10.093
welcome to another episode
of the "Hook and Chatter."

13:10.137 --> 13:11.921
- Brought to you by Alohair.

13:11.965 --> 13:13.836
- Tonight, we have a very
special guest for you.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.491
You may know him
as a UFC heavyweight champion,

13:16.534 --> 13:18.928
but we know him
as a firefighter.

13:18.972 --> 13:21.104
- And I know you guys
as my brothers.

13:21.148 --> 13:23.106
- Thanks, man.
- Man.

13:23.150 --> 13:26.109
- Give it up for Stipe Miocic.

13:26.153 --> 13:27.850
- Hey now!

13:27.894 --> 13:31.114
- So Stipe, you are in Tacoma
for your big fight tonight.

13:31.158 --> 13:32.855
Are you ready for it?
- So ready.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.117
- I just wanna jump in here
and say

13:34.161 --> 13:35.858
I think you're a great dad.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.294
I mean, some people
might say otherwise,

13:37.338 --> 13:38.818
I don't know
why they would do that.

13:38.861 --> 13:40.689
I would never personally
say something like that.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.299
But just so we're
clear on that.

13:42.343 --> 13:43.866
You ready for the fight?

13:43.910 --> 13:44.954
- Hell, yeah, I am.
Hey, listen,

13:44.998 --> 13:46.826
I'm hanging with
my new best friends.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.871
- Oh, hey!

13:48.915 --> 13:51.134
He's talking about us.
- Hey.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.966
- You are unreal, man!
- Oh, gosh.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.708
- All right, guys, hey,
I gonna get going,

13:59.751 --> 14:00.970
but I wanna hear
your predictions for tonight.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.885
- Oh, well,
you're definitely gonna win.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.495
KO in the third round.

14:04.539 --> 14:06.149
- I'll go one step further

14:06.193 --> 14:07.847
and say you'll put him to sleep
in round two, champ.

14:07.890 --> 14:11.154
- Excuse me.
Hot take, round one.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.678
- I love it. I love it.
- Thank you, Stipe.

14:13.722 --> 14:16.159
Good luck tonight on the fight,
and thank you out there

14:16.203 --> 14:21.164
for listening to another
episode of "Hook and Chatter."

14:21.208 --> 14:22.731
<i>
- Thanks so much.</i>

14:22.774 --> 14:25.038
- Ah, man, you were great.
- That was so fun.

14:25.081 --> 14:29.172
Hey, brothers, I'd go into
a fire with you anytime.

14:29.216 --> 14:32.001
- Come here, man.
- Buddy.

14:32.045 --> 14:34.917
- Oh, man.
- Man! Ah!

14:34.961 --> 14:38.181
- Granny, Andy, Little Stipe,

14:38.225 --> 14:43.012
parting is such sweet sorrow.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.709
- Ah.

14:47.060 --> 14:50.019
- All right.
- Yeah.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.194
- Cool.

14:51.238 --> 14:52.935
- I love you guys.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.894
- Hey, go get him, champ!

14:57.592 --> 14:59.550
- For a guy who punches people
in the face for a living,

14:59.594 --> 15:01.596
he's a really,
really nice guy.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.206
- Right? Nice.
- I know.

15:03.250 --> 15:04.729
I feel so guilty for everything
we said about him.

15:04.773 --> 15:06.035
- Right.

15:06.079 --> 15:08.037
- Stipe taught me
something today,

15:08.081 --> 15:10.213
and now I'm a better person.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.389
- He has that effect
on all of us.

15:12.433 --> 15:15.044
Son of a bitch.

15:15.088 --> 15:18.221
- Come here.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.963
- I love you guys.
- I love you guys.

15:21.007 --> 15:23.226
I was really scared.

15:23.270 --> 15:26.229
I was really nervous.

15:26.273 --> 15:28.928
- Okay, you're not
Lucy's godfather anymore.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.233
- Oh, really?
- And you're not her uncle.

15:30.277 --> 15:32.061
- Hold on.

15:32.105 --> 15:33.410
- Well, Terry, you can't
really declare that.

15:33.454 --> 15:35.282
- I can and I did.
- Okay. Knock it off.

15:35.325 --> 15:37.066
- But he said
we're not friends.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.763
- He's just trying
to push your buttons.

15:38.807 --> 15:42.419
Now, both of you have a seat,
and I am going to tell

15:42.463 --> 15:45.292
the story
of what really happened.

15:45.335 --> 15:46.641
- We should take the rest
of the shift off

15:46.684 --> 15:47.947
and actually go to the fight.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.252
And hang out
with him afterwards.

15:49.296 --> 15:50.427
- Dude's been training
for months.

15:50.471 --> 15:52.299
He's probably ready to party.

15:52.342 --> 15:54.083
- Hey, we should offer to pay
the change fee for his flight

15:54.127 --> 15:55.780
and take him out
to the engine house

15:55.824 --> 15:57.608
for like beer wings
and shuffleboard and stuff.

15:57.652 --> 15:59.262
- A whole night on the town.
- Yeah, he'd probably love it.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.090
- It's Stipe.
- No way.

16:01.134 --> 16:02.439
- Ha-ha, dude!
- Hey man,

16:02.483 --> 16:04.093
you're on speakerphone.
How are you doing?

16:04.137 --> 16:06.008
- What's up, man?
We're all here, my brother.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.271
<i>- I just wanna let you know
that Rosa downloaded </i>

16:08.315 --> 16:10.970
<i>your last podcast for me
while we were taking pictures. </i>

16:11.013 --> 16:12.841
<i>My left is slow?</i>

16:12.884 --> 16:14.016
- What? <i>
- My footwork sucks?</i>

16:14.060 --> 16:15.800
<i>I should join the Rockettes?</i>

16:15.844 --> 16:18.151
- No, no, no, no. <i>
- I'm a terrible father?</i>

16:18.194 --> 16:20.109
- That was a hot take. <i>
- I've got a hot take.</i>

16:20.153 --> 16:21.981
<i>You're fucking dead!</i>

16:22.024 --> 16:23.286
<i>I'm coming back
to kick your asses! </i>

16:23.330 --> 16:25.114
- Put it away.
Put it away.

16:25.158 --> 16:26.986
- I told you a podcast
was a bad idea.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.118
- Just wait,
I can't think straight.

16:29.162 --> 16:30.685
Is that a hot take?

16:34.384 --> 16:35.995
- I should have
seen it coming.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.300
Eddie said he set me up

16:37.344 --> 16:40.695
with the hottest probie at 24,
Dak Blunt.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.131
- Did I say hottest?
I meant sweatiest.

16:42.175 --> 16:43.698
- You thought
Dak Blunt was hot?

16:43.741 --> 16:46.309
- But I did marry him.
Settle down.

16:46.353 --> 16:49.182
<i>I wasn't a fan of Pounders,
but I went, </i>

16:49.225 --> 16:51.140
<i>and when I walked in,</i>

16:51.184 --> 16:53.490
<i>the first thing I saw
was Eddie's friend. </i>

16:53.534 --> 16:56.145
<i>- He wasn't my friend.
- Okay, yeah, we get it. </i>

16:56.189 --> 16:59.018
<i>Anyway, the guy was finishing
off a pound of onion rings, </i>

16:59.061 --> 17:01.020
<i>and ehh, I didn't wanna
make it weird, </i>

17:01.063 --> 17:05.328
<i>so I avoided eye contact
while I looked for my date. </i>

17:05.372 --> 17:09.332
<i>But then I saw Eddie.
He was behind a plant. </i>

17:09.376 --> 17:12.074
<i>And you had
that stupid mullet. </i>

17:12.118 --> 17:14.511
<i>- If by mullet you mean
my sweet ass pompadour, </i>

17:14.555 --> 17:16.339
<i>then yeah,
it was a mullet. </i>

17:16.383 --> 17:19.255
<i>- And I realized
I'd been duped. </i>

17:21.388 --> 17:23.085
- Cap! Cap! Cap! Cap!
- So sorry to interrupt--

17:23.129 --> 17:25.174
- Can we have the rest
of the day off?

17:25.218 --> 17:27.176
Just the rest of the day off?
- Hey, you know better.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.178
You're in the middle of
a shift, go roll some hoses.

17:29.222 --> 17:32.094
- Ah!
This way, this way.

17:32.138 --> 17:35.402
- Anyway...

17:35.445 --> 17:37.360
<i>I knew that Eddie thought
he had pulled off </i>

17:37.404 --> 17:39.101
<i>this epic prank.</i>

17:41.582 --> 17:43.410
<i>So decided to enjoy myself.</i>

17:46.804 --> 17:48.545
<i>- And then your father puked.</i>

17:48.589 --> 17:50.373
- You didn't enjoy
our first date?

17:50.417 --> 17:52.071
- No, Terry, you puked up

17:52.114 --> 17:55.117
like a hundred shrimp
and a pound of onion rings.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.205
- How could you even
eat onion rings

17:56.249 --> 17:57.902
after you
ate all that shrimp?

17:57.946 --> 17:59.208
- What do you eat
to settle your stomach?

17:59.252 --> 18:00.775
- I don't.

18:00.818 --> 18:02.255
- How do you not remember
the shrimp-eating contest?

18:02.298 --> 18:04.213
- Oh, you know what?
I do you remember it now.

18:04.257 --> 18:05.910
I won.

18:05.954 --> 18:08.130
- I also realized

18:08.174 --> 18:10.393
that the only way
to get back at Eddie

18:10.437 --> 18:13.135
was to go on a second date,
and a third, fourth,

18:13.179 --> 18:16.399
fifth, sixth, whatever it took
to ruin the prank.

18:16.443 --> 18:18.227
- Hold on.
How far did this go?

18:18.271 --> 18:20.142
Was I born as a result of you
trying to ruin Eddie's prank?

18:20.186 --> 18:23.276
- No, I ended up enjoying
myself on the second date.

18:23.319 --> 18:26.757
And after the third date,
it wasn't about Eddie anymore.

18:26.801 --> 18:29.978
I was looking forward to
spending time with your father.

18:30.021 --> 18:33.155
I thought he was
sweet and funny.

18:33.199 --> 18:34.765
- So would you say it was

18:34.809 --> 18:36.985
a love-after-the-third-date
kind of thing?

18:37.028 --> 18:39.248
- I thought it was love
after the sixth date.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.424
- Wait, was that
the first night we--

18:41.468 --> 18:43.426
- Oh, God.

18:43.470 --> 18:46.429
- Stop it.
- Yes. Yes, it was.

18:46.473 --> 18:48.605
That was the night
I found out

18:48.649 --> 18:53.175
what a phenomenal
and generous lover Terry was.

18:53.219 --> 18:56.439
- Oh, Mom, so gross.
- Disgusting.

18:56.483 --> 18:58.267
- Guess what.

18:58.311 --> 18:59.442
He still is.

18:59.486 --> 19:01.792
- Oh. Oh, God.
- Ugh.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.794
- Hm.

19:11.324 --> 19:13.630
- Do you think the three
of us could take him together?

19:13.674 --> 19:15.197
- There's only one way
to find out,

19:15.241 --> 19:16.807
but I don't wanna find out.

19:16.851 --> 19:18.157
- Should one of us look
to see if he's here?

19:18.200 --> 19:19.636
- No way.
- "Rock Paper Scissors."

19:19.680 --> 19:21.160
- Okay, okay, okay.

19:21.203 --> 19:25.294
- One, two, three, shoot.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.296
- Hey boys.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.646
- Oh, God!
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:29.690 --> 19:32.475
- Dude, it's all just one
big misunderstanding, okay?

19:32.519 --> 19:34.303
- You broke my heart!

19:34.347 --> 19:36.218
- We didn't mean any of it.
We were just being contrarian.

19:36.262 --> 19:39.308
- It's time for night-night!

19:39.352 --> 19:41.223
- Seems like the joke is really
on you, Uncle Eddie.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.312
You set them up
and all these years later,

19:43.356 --> 19:45.053
they're still in love.

19:45.096 --> 19:47.490
- Yeah, you're welcome.
You wouldn't exist without me.

19:47.534 --> 19:50.493
- I think it's safe to say
Eddie's prank backfired on him.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.539
- Still better than anything
you ever pulled.

19:52.582 --> 19:54.323
- Is that what you think?
- Yeah.

19:54.367 --> 19:57.326
- Luce, Let me tell you
about another one.

19:57.370 --> 20:02.331
A few years later,
I had a Swedish hairstylist.

20:02.375 --> 20:05.856
She was great at hair,
but she was a horrible person.

20:05.900 --> 20:10.209
She was here on a work visa,
and she wanted to trap a man

20:10.252 --> 20:14.691
and marry him,
so she could get a green card.

20:14.735 --> 20:16.519
- You didn't.
- I did.

20:16.563 --> 20:21.568
I knew you couldn't pass up
on a tall, blonde,

20:21.611 --> 20:23.700
beautiful Swedish woman.

20:23.744 --> 20:27.269
So I set you up.
And then what happened?

20:27.313 --> 20:29.706
- I married her.
- You married her.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.360
- Aunt Ulsa?

20:31.404 --> 20:33.057
She's the reason
I love lutefisk.

20:33.101 --> 20:34.537
- Me too.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.409
- And after she got
the green card,

20:36.452 --> 20:38.541
what happened?

20:38.585 --> 20:41.370
- She divorced me
and took half my money.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.375
- She was a great hairdresser.

20:46.419 --> 20:51.075
And that was a great prank.

20:51.119 --> 20:53.382
Oh, my God.

20:53.426 --> 20:55.558
- Holy shit.

20:55.602 --> 20:59.258
- Oh, oh, oh, and while
you two were bickering

20:59.301 --> 21:03.262
over whether or not you were
friends, I bought the boat.

21:03.305 --> 21:04.915
With my money.

21:04.959 --> 21:09.093
You're welcome to join
me on the <i>Yeah Buoy</i>

21:09.137 --> 21:10.747
anytime you want.

21:10.791 --> 21:13.141
- Oh, no, you didn't.

21:15.665 --> 21:17.972
- It's a good name.
- Not the hair.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.452
- B-U-O-Y.

21:19.495 --> 21:20.931
- Love you, Mom.

21:20.975 --> 21:22.977
- Bye, babe.
- Wow.

21:23.020 --> 21:26.285
But still,
the burning question remains.

21:28.156 --> 21:30.158
Who can really eat
the most shrimp?

21:37.470 --> 21:38.471
- Mm.

21:38.514 --> 21:40.647
Ahh.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.129
- Oh, you don't look
so good, Terry.

21:45.173 --> 21:47.131
- I feel great.
- You gonna quit?

21:47.175 --> 21:49.351
'Cause I'm not.
- I like my shrimp extra veiny.

21:49.395 --> 21:50.787
- So do I.

21:50.831 --> 21:52.354
That's where
the taste comes from, bitch.

21:52.398 --> 21:54.661
<i>- Stipe Miocic is pounding
Bobby Ferapolis </i>

21:54.704 --> 21:56.619
<i>with his left hook.</i>

21:56.663 --> 21:58.317
<i>You can tell he got
some extra practice-- </i>

21:58.360 --> 22:00.449
- Are you guys ever gonna
tell me what happened?

22:01.842 --> 22:04.148
I told you, Luce,
he beat us up.

22:04.192 --> 22:05.628
- You're sticking
with the story

22:05.672 --> 22:07.630
that the UFC heavyweight
champion came here

22:07.674 --> 22:09.806
and kicked your ass?

22:09.850 --> 22:12.635
- Yeah.
- If you say so.

22:12.679 --> 22:14.463
<i>- He's got a fire
in his eyes. </i>

22:14.507 --> 22:16.639
- Man, he's got
shitty footwork.

22:16.683 --> 22:18.685
- Don't say that.
- Mm.

22:18.728 --> 22:21.514
They keep getting better.

22:21.557 --> 22:24.343
You okay?
Do you wanna stop?

22:25.692 --> 22:27.868
- Oh.

22:29.696 --> 22:32.655
- Oh, God.
- Oh, yes!

22:32.699 --> 22:34.831
Yes!

22:34.875 --> 22:37.399
I will never let you forget
this, Terry McConky.

22:37.443 --> 22:38.531
Never!
Ha-ha!

22:51.718 --> 22:54.198
- Go.
- I'm going.

22:54.242 --> 22:57.027
- It's your turn.
- I know whose turn it is.

22:57.071 --> 22:58.377
I'm concentrating.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.030
- Does your fly help you
concentrate?

23:00.074 --> 23:02.250
- Yeah, it does.
Getting air to the other brain.

23:06.297 --> 23:08.691
- Ah!

23:08.735 --> 23:10.693
- That reminds me of when I
beat you in the shrimp cocktail

23:10.737 --> 23:13.435
eating contest twice.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.394
- You never beat me
eating anything.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.439
- Damnit, Terry!
Yes, I did.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.539
- Two.

23:36.502 --> 23:39.113
- Would you like me to cut
your shrimp into smaller pieces

23:39.156 --> 23:40.723
so it'll be easier to chew?

23:40.767 --> 23:43.073
- No!
- Ah-ah.

23:43.117 --> 23:44.423
- Okay.

23:44.466 --> 23:47.469
- Oh, watch the hair! -

23:47.513 --> 23:49.471
I need a nap.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.255
- You give up?

23:51.299 --> 23:54.433
- I give up.
- Again.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.260
- I'm gonna go watch
"Judge Jenny Jr."

23:56.304 --> 23:58.480
- Oh, I'm coming with.
I'm coming with.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.569
Whoa. Hey, hey.

24:00.613 --> 24:03.485
Hey, hey, hey!

24:03.529 --> 24:05.095
Hey!

24:05.139 --> 24:06.488
Oh, my sciatica!
