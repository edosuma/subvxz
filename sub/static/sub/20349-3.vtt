WEBVTT

00:09.825 --> 00:13.126
<i>As a former president,
I'm proud to lend my stature</i>

00:13.128 --> 00:15.094
<i>to this crucially important moment</i>

00:15.096 --> 00:18.131
and it's just an honor for me to be here

00:18.133 --> 00:19.566
as an official observer

00:19.568 --> 00:23.536
of Georgia's first free
and open election.

00:23.538 --> 00:26.104
And, in fact, the spreading of democracy

00:26.106 --> 00:29.575
is one of the cornerstones
of my foundation.

00:29.577 --> 00:31.744
- It is?
- So, thank you very much

00:31.746 --> 00:34.246
- and ma... mad-lab-blah.
- <i> Madloba.</i>

00:34.248 --> 00:36.215
- Thank you so much.
- <i> Madloba.</i>

00:36.217 --> 00:39.718
Jesus, democracy. What
a horror show this is.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.286
I didn't even know
Georgia was a country.

00:42.288 --> 00:44.288
Where'd our guide go? Oh, hey, Petradze.

00:44.290 --> 00:46.424
Do you have any water

00:46.426 --> 00:49.060
that doesn't come from a nuclear
power plant, by any chance?

00:49.062 --> 00:51.195
- Vodka.
- Okay, sure, fine. Vodka.

00:51.197 --> 00:53.030
Excuse me, it would be a great honor

00:53.032 --> 00:55.567
to introduce my daughter
to the president of USA.

00:55.569 --> 00:58.268
Hello! One day, you can
grow up to be president.

00:58.270 --> 01:00.337
No, not you. Your brother.

01:00.339 --> 01:02.172
Unbelievable.

01:02.174 --> 01:03.741
- Can we do picture?
- No.

01:03.743 --> 01:05.743
Oh, it's okay. I don't have camera.

01:05.745 --> 01:07.778
<i>Well, I'll tell you something.</i>

01:07.780 --> 01:10.981
All of this international shit
is gonna be great for my book.

01:10.983 --> 01:12.683
This is my second act.

01:12.685 --> 01:14.450
Selina Meyer travels the globe,

01:14.452 --> 01:17.253
spreading democracy like
patient zero, right, Petradze?

01:17.255 --> 01:18.855
- Yes?
- Oh, boy.

01:18.857 --> 01:20.556
This place sucks my ghost nard.

01:20.558 --> 01:22.091
Why couldn't you have gotten me on

01:22.093 --> 01:24.560
an international election
watching trip to Hawaii?

01:24.562 --> 01:26.962
Hawaii is rightfully a
monarchy and will be again.

01:26.964 --> 01:29.999
Look, did you read the CODEL
schedule of official events

01:30.001 --> 01:32.200
or were there not enough
pictures for you?

01:32.202 --> 01:34.335
Ooh, sex trafficking workshop.

01:34.337 --> 01:36.838
It's an anti-sex trafficking workshop.

01:36.840 --> 01:38.774
- Lame.
- Okay, that's enough for now.

01:38.776 --> 01:39.974
I need a drink.

01:39.976 --> 01:42.043
It's gotta be 8:00 AM somewhere.

01:42.045 --> 01:44.212
Checking in. Mike McLintock.

01:44.214 --> 01:46.915
You don't have a
reservation in this hotel.

01:46.917 --> 01:48.982
Richard, I don't have a reservation.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.484
Well, you were a last minute
addition to the trip,

01:50.486 --> 01:52.720
so it's possible that
we didn't make one.

01:52.722 --> 01:53.954
Richard Splett.

01:53.956 --> 01:56.390
- Oh, hello, boys!
- Madam President.

01:56.392 --> 01:57.825
Look at us, just like the good, old days

01:57.827 --> 02:00.728
except shittier in
every conceivable way.

02:00.730 --> 02:02.596
Hey, hey, gang's all here.

02:02.598 --> 02:05.197
Maybe we can win an
election for a change.

02:05.199 --> 02:08.300
- That came out wrong.
- Yeah, way wrong, right?

02:08.303 --> 02:10.402
So, Secretary Doyle has picked you

02:10.405 --> 02:11.905
for elder statesman duty?

02:11.907 --> 02:14.574
- Jailbait statesman.
- It's fine, it's okay.

02:14.576 --> 02:15.454
Doyle picked me because...

02:15.456 --> 02:17.243
So he's got a goat to
scape if things go wrong.

02:17.245 --> 02:19.612
- Yeah, yeah.
- They need political cover.

02:19.614 --> 02:21.980
Night and fog. Nacht und Nebel.

02:21.982 --> 02:23.181
Yeah, I haven't missed that.

02:23.183 --> 02:25.150
Secretary of State
Doyle for you, ma'am.

02:25.152 --> 02:27.085
Oh, all right.

02:27.087 --> 02:29.054
- Secretary Doyle?
<i>- Please hold for Secretary Doyle.</i>

02:29.056 --> 02:31.022
Okay, no. I don't get put on hold.

02:31.024 --> 02:33.158
Okay? When he comes on,
he gets put on hold.

02:33.160 --> 02:35.360
Kent, will you book a massage for me, but,
you know, there one where the girl...

02:35.362 --> 02:38.729
- Oh, fuck me.
- Congressman Ryan!

02:38.731 --> 02:43.000
I haven't spoken to you since
the historic House vote.

02:43.002 --> 02:44.178
Yes...

02:44.180 --> 02:47.705
I just wanted to thank you for
all that you've done for me.

02:47.707 --> 02:52.510
And I wanna let you know
that I will destroy you

02:52.512 --> 02:54.712
in ways that are so creative,

02:54.714 --> 02:57.380
they will honor me for it
at the Kennedy Center.

02:57.382 --> 02:59.215
Please hold
for President Meyer.

02:59.217 --> 03:01.852
Oh, you're putting me on hold.
Actually, do you think you could not?

03:01.854 --> 03:03.820
- 'Cause she's right here.
- I'm here, I'm here, I'm... Andrew?

03:03.822 --> 03:05.655
<i>- Please hold for Secretary Doyle.</i>
- God damn it.

03:05.657 --> 03:09.025
So, he who hath betrayed me

03:09.027 --> 03:11.160
standeth before me now.

03:11.162 --> 03:13.496
Hello, Congressman Ryan!
It's been a while.

03:13.498 --> 03:16.565
I am gonna find ways
to destroy you so hard

03:16.567 --> 03:18.266
that everybody at the Kennedy Center

03:18.268 --> 03:20.836
is gonna take a fucking massive shit.

03:20.838 --> 03:21.942
It's really nice to see you.

03:21.944 --> 03:24.072
So, I assume you're gonna
beg for your job back.

03:24.074 --> 03:27.275
It's a very kind offer, but I already have
a better job working for President Meyer.

03:27.277 --> 03:29.811
- I thought you knew that.
- Okay, you know what, I don't need you.

03:29.813 --> 03:32.680
I already have 434
brand-new best friends

03:32.682 --> 03:34.115
and we're all going to dinner tonight.

03:34.117 --> 03:36.317
And you're not invited. Sorry.
Congressmen only.

03:36.319 --> 03:38.319
Have fun.

03:38.321 --> 03:40.388
What's up, fellas? How you doing?

03:40.390 --> 03:42.390
Hey, you wanna go monitor some dinner?

03:42.392 --> 03:44.358
I hear that horse is legal to eat here.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.394
Uh, I'm actually pretty jet-lagged.

03:46.396 --> 03:48.371
Probably gonna just
catch up on some sleep.

03:49.031 --> 03:50.564
Let me know if you guys do go out, okay?

03:50.566 --> 03:53.099
I got a Georgian SIM card.
Got text forwarding.

03:53.101 --> 03:54.668
I'll here from you? All right, later.

03:54.670 --> 03:58.605
I was suffering from
dehydration and exhaustion.

03:58.607 --> 04:00.674
That's not the Buddy Calhoun
I see in the mirror.

04:00.676 --> 04:03.076
Although, it would be if you
stepped out of the shower.

04:03.078 --> 04:04.710
- <i> Now, Ms. Brookheimer...</i>
- Mm?

04:04.712 --> 04:06.612
you're not only Buddy
Calhoun's campaign manager,

04:06.614 --> 04:08.581
but you're also his fiancée.

04:08.583 --> 04:10.315
And congratulations on that, by the way.

04:10.317 --> 04:12.852
- Thank you, Danny.
- <i> Now, wouldn't you concede</i>

04:12.854 --> 04:16.522
that when your fiancé exposed
himself to a police woman

04:16.524 --> 04:19.058
that he hurt his chances
of becoming elected?

04:19.060 --> 04:21.392
- I... I've seen the video, of course...
-<i> You have?</i>

04:21.394 --> 04:22.994
Can we roll that video one
more time for our audience?

04:22.996 --> 04:26.397
And I tried not to think
of the politics of it all.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.225
And here's the moment
where he exposes himself.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.100
That's right, yes.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.436
But everyone... yeah, that's...

04:31.438 --> 04:33.204
<i>but for myself,</i>

04:33.206 --> 04:36.675
I'm happiest when Buddy
and I are on the couch...

04:36.677 --> 04:37.784
<i> Can we play that again?</i>

04:37.786 --> 04:39.910
eating popcorn and
watching "Downton Abbey."

04:39.912 --> 04:41.879
<i>In the interest of full disclosure,</i>

04:41.881 --> 04:44.582
Ms. Brookheimer and I did
have a brief relationship

04:44.584 --> 04:47.585
- when she was a much younger woman.
- You did?

04:47.587 --> 04:50.588
Thank you to you both.
We'll be right back.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.022
<i>We're clear.</i>

04:52.024 --> 04:54.091
Ames, who's your favorite
character on "Downton"?

04:54.093 --> 04:56.893
I don't know. Abby, I guess.

04:56.895 --> 04:58.160
Yep.

05:00.031 --> 05:01.998
<i>President Meyer's
still holding on line two.</i>

05:02.000 --> 05:06.235
Selina! So, Murman was a brutal
bastard who ruled with an iron fist

05:06.237 --> 05:08.671
he liked to insert in the
anus of his opponents.

05:08.673 --> 05:10.740
<i>But when it came to the US viewpoint,</i>

05:10.742 --> 05:12.240
<i>at least he was a good listener.</i>

05:12.242 --> 05:14.476
Yeah, and he did a beautiful
rendition of "Rendition."

05:14.478 --> 05:16.311
- <i> Exactly.</i>
- I don't have a hotel room.

05:16.313 --> 05:17.746
But it's time for a change,

05:17.748 --> 05:20.248
so we're backing Professor
Nikolai Genidze.

05:20.250 --> 05:22.584
He's a new voice for
democracy in the region

05:22.586 --> 05:26.855
and would be a major victory
for the Doyle Doctrine.

05:26.857 --> 05:30.224
You have a doctrine now? What is it,
"Boners are rare, don't waste them"?

05:30.226 --> 05:33.160
Hey, did you think of that while you were
walking on the beach with a metal detector

05:33.162 --> 05:35.529
or however you fill your empty days?

05:35.531 --> 05:37.865
- Oh, that's nice.
- <i> Look, just sit back,</i>

05:37.867 --> 05:41.802
<i>take your lead from the UN Special
Envoy for Election Monitoring.</i>

05:41.804 --> 05:44.438
- What? Who is that?
- Selina!

05:44.440 --> 05:46.205
Oh, fuck. Minna!

05:46.207 --> 05:49.709
- Hi.
- You look absolutely radiant.

05:49.711 --> 05:52.445
- Oh, thank you.
- Yes, your stay in the insane asylum,

05:52.447 --> 05:54.380
- it's really agreed with you.
- It was a spa.

05:54.382 --> 05:57.350
No, no, a spa is where you go
to get a massage and the like.

05:57.352 --> 05:59.285
You were in an insane asylum.

05:59.287 --> 06:01.287
Oh, it's been fun to see you.

06:01.289 --> 06:04.123
I have such a big day tomorrow because
I have an election to supervise.

06:04.125 --> 06:07.325
I know, because I am
supervising your supervising.

06:07.327 --> 06:09.528
- Ah.
- We have so much to say to each other.

06:09.530 --> 06:11.897
- Well, okay, okay. Goodbye.
- I look forward to it. See you later.

06:11.899 --> 06:14.099
- Oh, God.
- Hey, ma'am,

06:14.101 --> 06:15.868
we have a situation
with your hotel room.

06:15.870 --> 06:18.236
- What is it?
- Your bidet is splashy

06:18.238 --> 06:19.845
and there's no terry
cloth robe or shower cap.

06:19.847 --> 06:20.905
Wait, you tested my bidet?

06:20.907 --> 06:22.516
Don't worry, I'm gonna
fix this before tub time.

06:22.518 --> 06:23.107
I don't care.

06:23.109 --> 06:25.710
- I'm on it.
- Hey.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:34.754 --> 06:37.187
Hey, Kent.

06:37.189 --> 06:38.889
Sorry, Mike, you cannot stay with me.

06:38.891 --> 06:41.091
Please don't make me make up a reason.

06:41.093 --> 06:43.160
Listen to me. I went to
find a hotel room, right?

06:43.162 --> 06:45.962
Nobody speaks English here, everything
was really confusing to me,

06:45.964 --> 06:47.230
and I was chased by children.

06:47.232 --> 06:50.367
And I think I may have voted.

06:50.369 --> 06:54.870
Mike, that is the kind of voting
irregularity that we are here to prevent.

06:54.872 --> 06:57.539
That sounds bad. Look, please,
can you help me get it off?

06:57.541 --> 07:01.043
Unless you want the entire thumb
removed with a utility blade,

07:01.045 --> 07:03.579
I suggest you find another person.

07:03.581 --> 07:05.514
Mom, I told you

07:05.516 --> 07:08.150
I get more homesick when you call.

07:08.152 --> 07:11.186
Hi, what do you have
that's like SpaghettiOs?

07:11.188 --> 07:14.388
and I said, "It's in my carry-on."

07:14.390 --> 07:17.859
You know what, forget it.
I'm not hungry.

07:17.861 --> 07:20.494
Oh, crap.

07:20.496 --> 07:22.630
Oh, Mike, now's not a good time.

07:22.632 --> 07:24.999
- I'm laying out her shoes, Mike!
- You have to help me.

07:25.001 --> 07:26.768
I accidentally voted and
now my thumb is green.

07:26.770 --> 07:28.902
The same thing happened to me!
Oh, my God!

07:28.904 --> 07:30.738
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.
- How did it happen?

07:30.740 --> 07:32.873
I went out to get a terry cloth
robe and there was this crowd

07:32.875 --> 07:34.441
and I asked them where Nordstrom's was

07:34.443 --> 07:36.543
and then the next thing I
know, they dyed my thumb

07:36.545 --> 07:38.178
and an old lady who smelled like
cumin wouldn't stop hugging me!

07:38.180 --> 07:40.347
- Mine smelled like paprika.
- Oh, God!

07:40.349 --> 07:41.949
We cannot let anyone see this.

07:41.951 --> 07:43.717
I can't afford to lose this job, Gary,

07:43.719 --> 07:45.051
<i>but I can't afford to keep it either.</i>

07:45.053 --> 07:46.853
I mean, it so expensive
to commute from DC.

07:46.855 --> 07:48.554
- And I haven't been paid yet.
- Oh, Mike.

07:48.556 --> 07:50.389
But I don't wanna lose it, I think.

07:50.391 --> 07:53.092
- Uh-huh.
- Hey, Gary, can I sleep on your couch?

07:53.094 --> 07:54.260
No.

07:54.262 --> 07:56.729
- Hard no?
- It's a hard no.

07:56.731 --> 07:58.664
<i>Hey, ma'am.</i>

07:58.666 --> 08:00.399
Get some food before everyone else.

08:00.401 --> 08:03.368
Okay, I never ever wanna see the
inside of your mouth again.

08:03.370 --> 08:05.771
Okay? It looks like a Haitian
porta-potty in there.

08:05.773 --> 08:08.039
- Copy that.
- Okay, I just saw it again.

08:08.041 --> 08:09.507
- Right?
- Copy.

08:09.509 --> 08:11.476
I find this kind of food
display really repulsive.

08:11.478 --> 08:12.911
- I know.
- Just a spoonful of this caviar

08:12.913 --> 08:14.780
will pay for a wind turbine
for a whole village.

08:14.782 --> 08:18.183
Yeah, but do we really want these
people to have electricity?

08:18.185 --> 08:21.252
Professor Nikolai Genidze,
he's Georgia's only hope

08:21.254 --> 08:24.188
for escape this cycle of
corruption and decadence.

08:24.190 --> 08:26.857
Jesus, you and Doyle really
have a wide-on for this guy.

08:26.859 --> 08:29.760
Well, you know that the moment that he announced
that he was running for the presidency,

08:29.762 --> 08:32.729
Murman tried to poison him
in a sushi restaurant.

08:32.731 --> 08:37.066
Well, it's a miracle that anybody survives
eating sushi in this country, Minna.

08:37.068 --> 08:39.635
He has some scarring.
It is purely cosmetic.

08:39.636 --> 08:42.505
But there's still some
cysts and some bubbling.

08:42.506 --> 08:44.607
- Oh, my God, I need a drink.
<i>- Selina!</i>

08:44.609 --> 08:47.543
- Madam President!
- Murman, it's so good to see you!

08:47.545 --> 08:50.146
Have you imprisoned any
good novelists recently?

08:51.749 --> 08:53.215
Ah, Ms. Hakkinen.

08:53.217 --> 08:56.484
How are things in the
international busybody circuit?

08:56.486 --> 08:58.653
- Great, thank you.
- I was sorry to see

08:58.655 --> 09:00.588
that your forceful condemnation

09:00.590 --> 09:04.193
did not do more to stop the
recent genocide in the Congo.

09:04.195 --> 09:06.761
- Maybe next genocide.
- Or the one after that.

09:06.763 --> 09:09.198
- Excuse me.
- Oh, hey, Ben.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.898
You sure do get around, don't you?

09:10.900 --> 09:13.334
Murman here is an old client of mine,

09:13.336 --> 09:15.903
and the only reason he hasn't been
dragged naked through the streets

09:15.905 --> 09:17.671
and hung upside down from a lamp post

09:17.673 --> 09:19.173
with his cock stuffed in his mouth

09:19.175 --> 09:21.909
is because he took my
advice from time to time.

09:21.911 --> 09:24.645
- Guilty as charged.
- Okay, me, too.

09:24.647 --> 09:27.714
Madam President, if I could
have a word in private?

09:27.716 --> 09:30.783
Absolutely, although, if it
takes more than five minutes,

09:30.785 --> 09:33.220
I think that Amnesty
International will be alerted.

09:33.222 --> 09:35.956
I'm not
afraid of those guys.

09:35.958 --> 09:39.525
Montez and Doyle, they're trying
to make Georgia more like America.

09:39.527 --> 09:41.661
Look, I saw your last election.

09:41.663 --> 09:42.205
No, thank you.

09:42.207 --> 09:43.830
Well, I can't argue
with you there, Murman.

09:43.832 --> 09:45.564
Let me tell you little story

09:45.566 --> 09:47.733
about growing up as a tire-burner's son

09:47.735 --> 09:49.101
in the Gurjaani countryside...

09:49.103 --> 09:51.370
Murman, no, no, no. I love your stories

09:51.372 --> 09:54.139
and this is, I'm sure, shaping
up to be a great one...

09:54.141 --> 09:57.243
young Murman in the countryside,
etcetera, etcetera...

09:57.245 --> 09:59.544
- but I really do have to get...
- Selina, I would like to make

09:59.546 --> 10:05.583
a $10 million donation to
help you build your library.

10:07.020 --> 10:10.588
I cannot possibly accept that.

10:10.590 --> 10:14.259
I mean, even the appearance
of a quid pro quo...

10:14.261 --> 10:16.460
Oh, no, no, no, there are
no threads attached.

10:16.462 --> 10:18.795
And you should know that this donation

10:18.797 --> 10:20.397
will be completely untraceable.

10:20.399 --> 10:23.166
It will come from my
Georgian AIDS foundation.

10:23.168 --> 10:26.803
- Mm, such a terrible killer.
- Tragic, yes.

10:26.805 --> 10:31.508
- But we're making real progress.
- We are. We are.

10:31.510 --> 10:34.444
I trust I have made
myself suitably clear.

10:34.446 --> 10:38.180
As clear as the coffee table Danny
Thomas had his hookers shit on.

10:38.182 --> 10:40.249
It's an American expression.

10:40.251 --> 10:43.786
Danny Thomas also founded the St.
Jude's Hospital for Children, so.

10:43.788 --> 10:48.224
- Ah, yes, the yin and the yang.
- There you go, exactly.

10:48.226 --> 10:51.360
<i> Your mother just added
democracy to the foundation.</i>

10:51.362 --> 10:53.594
So, now it's the Selina Meyer Foundation

10:53.596 --> 10:55.434
for Adult Literacy, Aids...

10:55.436 --> 10:58.566
And the Advancement
of Global Democracy.

10:58.568 --> 10:59.901
Hey, guys.

10:59.903 --> 11:02.037
- Dan.
- So, uh, what's up?

11:02.039 --> 11:06.007
- How are you?
- I'm good, I'm good. Thanks.

11:06.009 --> 11:09.243
- How's your family?
- I don't know.

11:09.245 --> 11:12.046
Uh, why, have you heard something?

11:12.048 --> 11:14.681
No, it's, um... the thing is that

11:14.683 --> 11:17.617
Marjorie and I have decided
that we wanna have a baby,

11:17.619 --> 11:19.954
- <i> and we'd like to do it...</i>
- I will give you my sperm.

11:19.956 --> 11:21.688
- Oh, great!
- Yeah.

11:21.690 --> 11:25.159
- I thought that would take a lot longer.
- No.

11:25.161 --> 11:27.460
Is there anything else
that you wanna talk about?

11:27.462 --> 11:30.596
- I'm good.
- Well, we'll send you the details.

11:30.598 --> 11:33.866
And if you could not ejaculate for the
next 72 hours, that would be ideal.

11:33.868 --> 11:38.237
Okay, uh, could we start the
clock in, like, 30 minutes?

11:38.239 --> 11:40.639
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Actually, no.

11:40.641 --> 11:42.041
No, make it 40.

11:42.043 --> 11:44.276
The girl I'm thinking
of likes to talk first.

11:45.679 --> 11:49.081
Amber, it's Dan-Dan. You in midtown?

11:49.083 --> 11:50.782
<i>Ben, I need to talk to you.</i>

11:50.784 --> 11:52.717
Yeah, what... what happened with Murman?

11:52.719 --> 11:53.719
Okay.

11:56.490 --> 11:58.490
He just offered me...

11:59.593 --> 12:04.962
a $10 million donation to my library.

12:04.964 --> 12:07.431
That's keep a lot of
docents in Rockports.

12:07.433 --> 12:09.733
I'd kill for a job where I
could wear flats all day.

12:09.735 --> 12:13.137
But, look, I can't take that money...

12:14.173 --> 12:15.873
- right?
- Right.

12:15.875 --> 12:17.640
- Right.
- Right.

12:17.642 --> 12:20.510
I mean, I definitely
cannot take that money.

12:21.646 --> 12:22.945
But hold up.

12:22.947 --> 12:25.348
If I did take it,

12:25.350 --> 12:28.084
- would I be compromising my...
- Reputation.

12:28.086 --> 12:29.819
- Well, please.
- Your integrity.

12:29.821 --> 12:31.721
Yes! My integrity!

12:31.723 --> 12:34.390
I cannot lose my integrity.

12:34.392 --> 12:36.058
Without that, I am nothing.

12:36.060 --> 12:39.561
How would we make sure no one
finds out about the cash?

12:39.563 --> 12:41.130
Technically, a library donation

12:41.132 --> 12:43.665
would not be illegal under US law.

12:43.667 --> 12:44.866
What about Georgian law?

12:44.868 --> 12:47.102
There is literally no Georgian law.

12:47.104 --> 12:49.104
And I'm using "literally" correctly.

12:49.106 --> 12:52.606
So, are you saying
that I should take it?

12:52.608 --> 12:54.775
- I don't know.
- It's hard to say.

12:54.777 --> 12:57.311
See, at least when I was
leader of the free world,

12:57.313 --> 12:59.347
people told me what to do.

12:59.349 --> 13:00.848
Okay, what happened with this?

13:00.850 --> 13:02.517
- Did you drink it?
- What happened?

13:02.519 --> 13:04.352
- I don't know.
- So crazy.

13:04.354 --> 13:07.488
So, look, I was thinking, Minna,

13:07.490 --> 13:09.856
w-would it be that bad

13:09.858 --> 13:12.325
if Murman actually did win?

13:12.327 --> 13:14.894
Well, that depends how you define bad.

13:14.896 --> 13:16.896
You know, I'm just saying the poisoning

13:16.898 --> 13:19.533
and the torture and the
death squads aside,

13:19.535 --> 13:22.569
I think Murman is really good people.

13:22.571 --> 13:24.904
Honestly. And he's a
hell of a storyteller.

13:24.906 --> 13:28.774
Really. You know, you could actually
learn something from him, Minna.

13:28.776 --> 13:31.343
You know, his stories
have a solid point.

13:31.345 --> 13:33.812
They have a beginning and
a middle and an end.

13:33.814 --> 13:37.450
And it makes it kind of, you know,
interesting to sit and listen.

13:37.452 --> 13:38.750
Nikolai Genidze's scarring or no,

13:38.752 --> 13:41.720
he is the only hope for
the Georgian people.

13:41.722 --> 13:44.322
- Well...
- He has the soul of a poet.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.291
Yeah, that and a car with a sunroof

13:46.293 --> 13:49.294
could've bought you my virginity in '83.

13:49.296 --> 13:53.864
- You were 22?
- No, I was 15 in 1983.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.903
Right.

13:58.905 --> 14:00.904
- Well, I was, Minna.
- Right.

14:00.906 --> 14:02.606
- That's great.
- Yeah.

14:02.608 --> 14:04.541
Did I tell you that my son
Otto tried to commit suicide

14:04.543 --> 14:06.009
and that he is now not speaking to me?

14:06.011 --> 14:08.445
Did he throw himself
from a moving town car?

14:08.447 --> 14:12.116
No. No, he weighted his boots
and he jumped into an ice hole.

14:12.118 --> 14:14.351
- I'm so sorry, into what?
- Into an ice hole.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.519
- Like a hole they cut in the ice...
- Ah.

14:16.521 --> 14:18.488
- for fishing.
- Right.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.055
That makes sense.

14:20.057 --> 14:22.158
I wonder how much longer
it is to get to the hotel.

14:22.160 --> 14:26.095
- I'm not really sure...
- I think it's another 45, 50 minutes.

14:26.097 --> 14:28.331
Oh, my God.

14:31.469 --> 14:33.135
<i> Ooh, clink, clink.</i>

14:33.137 --> 14:34.869
Hey, Pinocchios.

14:34.871 --> 14:37.272
Your noses must've been
really tiny yesterday

14:37.274 --> 14:40.242
because you lied and now
they're normal-sized.

14:40.244 --> 14:44.446
Representative Ryan, you were
officially hazed last night.

14:44.448 --> 14:45.332
We got ya!

14:45.334 --> 14:47.982
Wait, does that mean
that I'm, like, in now or?

14:47.984 --> 14:50.217
- Totally!
- Well, then let's go celebrate!

14:50.219 --> 14:51.785
- I'm buying.
- Oh!

14:51.787 --> 14:53.487
By I, I mean the people
of New Hampshire.

14:53.489 --> 14:55.789
In the immortal words of will.i.am,

14:55.791 --> 14:57.491
"Tonight's gonna be really great!"

14:57.493 --> 14:59.993
Ooh, careful.

14:59.995 --> 15:01.562
- Oh, tuck in.
- I got shotgun.

15:01.564 --> 15:03.430
- You got shotgun, all right.
- Okay, here I come.

15:03.432 --> 15:05.866
- All right, push in, push in.
- Uh, we'll take this one.

15:05.868 --> 15:06.684
You guys take the next one.

15:06.686 --> 15:08.134
Oh, I don't know where
you guys are going.

15:08.136 --> 15:10.002
That's right.

15:13.408 --> 15:14.541
Fuck.

15:16.344 --> 15:17.910
Are you fucking...?!

15:17.912 --> 15:19.312
That's where that goes?

15:19.314 --> 15:22.182
Pick up your fucking chairs!

15:22.184 --> 15:24.416
I have not seen Nikolai since the Hague.

15:24.418 --> 15:25.268
Oh, really?

15:25.270 --> 15:27.819
Oh, you must remember not to
react to his disfigurement.

15:27.821 --> 15:29.454
- He's very sensitive.
- Wait, how bad is it, exactly?

15:29.456 --> 15:31.756
Oh, well, he was very handsome
before the poisoning,

15:31.758 --> 15:33.091
so you may not even notice it.

15:33.093 --> 15:35.194
There he is! Nikolai!

15:35.196 --> 15:38.197
Oh, welcome! Hello!

15:38.199 --> 15:40.832
- You look terrific.
- Minna. Mm.

15:40.834 --> 15:43.668
- Oh, she's kissing it.
- Well, that's why we moisturize.

15:43.670 --> 15:45.469
- Right.
- May I introduce to you

15:45.471 --> 15:48.172
the former president
of the United States

15:48.174 --> 15:50.007
- and my best friend.
- No, no, no.

15:50.009 --> 15:52.943
President Meyer!

15:52.945 --> 15:56.514
Oh, may I say that the
reports of your beauty

15:56.516 --> 15:58.515
have not been exaggerated.

15:58.517 --> 15:59.982
Well, back at you, red.

15:59.984 --> 16:02.619
And of course you know
my old friend, Ben.

16:02.621 --> 16:04.921
Ben! Doing God's work, I see.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.523
As long as the check clears.

16:06.525 --> 16:08.592
So, welcome to my humble abode.

16:08.594 --> 16:09.390
Thank you very much.

16:09.392 --> 16:11.261
I think you will find
it a great contrast

16:11.263 --> 16:13.597
to the vulgar palaces of Murman.

16:13.599 --> 16:15.631
I mean, you know, who
needs all that champagne

16:15.633 --> 16:20.001
when you can have all these
different kinds of wallpaper?

16:20.003 --> 16:22.371
- Well, dinner is served.
- Great!

16:22.373 --> 16:23.972
I know that you will soon find

16:23.974 --> 16:27.008
we Georgians are a
warm, friendly people.

16:27.010 --> 16:29.945
- Oh, good.
- Except for our politics.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.614
Okay.

16:33.717 --> 16:36.718
Minna? Minna, what is going on with you?

16:36.720 --> 16:39.554
- Are you all right?
- Selina, you see right through me.

16:39.556 --> 16:41.556
- What?
- It's because we are close as sisters.

16:41.558 --> 16:43.391
- No, we're not.
- You know that Nikolai and I

16:43.393 --> 16:46.093
are not only bound by mutual
respect and shared beliefs.

16:46.095 --> 16:49.730
We are also bound by powerful
physical attraction.

16:49.732 --> 16:51.732
- Oof.
- You gotta be kidding.

16:51.734 --> 16:54.234
- We are, in fact, lovers.
- What?

16:54.236 --> 16:55.302
- Lovers.
- Lovers.

16:55.304 --> 16:57.036
With Scab Calloway?

16:57.038 --> 17:00.173
His very touch makes me quiver.

17:00.175 --> 17:04.144
Okay, and now we get to eat food.

17:04.146 --> 17:06.179
<i>Good evening, Congressman.</i>

17:06.181 --> 17:07.813
Those new corduroys?

17:09.183 --> 17:10.715
They're new-ish.

17:10.718 --> 17:12.652
Well, I know you probably
have a lot of other offers,

17:12.654 --> 17:16.155
but if not, you know, maybe you
and me could do something.

17:16.156 --> 17:19.325
Yeah, maybe. I mean, I guess I
could move a couple things around.

17:19.327 --> 17:22.762
I don't know, the doorman told me about
this really cool concert that he knew of.

17:22.763 --> 17:24.929
- He said he thought I might like it.
- Well, luckily, the president

17:24.931 --> 17:26.665
gave me the rest of the night off
so I could put on my tourist hat.

17:32.906 --> 17:35.106
- It's actually my favorite joke ever.
- That's so good!

17:35.108 --> 17:37.008
- Did you wanna go?
- Yeah!

17:37.010 --> 17:38.176
All right.

17:38.178 --> 17:40.144
<i>We have adopted</i>

17:40.146 --> 17:42.346
all the worst traits of Russia

17:42.348 --> 17:45.015
without any of the good ones.

17:45.017 --> 17:49.019
Not that there are many of those.

17:52.090 --> 17:54.391
So, it is now time

17:54.393 --> 17:57.127
<i>for Georgia to face west.</i>

17:57.129 --> 17:59.696
- Eat it.
- What?

17:59.698 --> 18:01.798
Eat the soup.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.333
Why?

18:03.335 --> 18:05.968
Because I'm hungry.

18:05.970 --> 18:08.971
I need to know if it's been poisoned.

18:10.842 --> 18:13.543
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

18:15.512 --> 18:18.179
I don't wanna do that.

18:18.181 --> 18:21.049
Just a tiny, tiny taste.

18:24.822 --> 18:29.257
<i>We will adopt what works
and discard what does not.</i>

18:29.259 --> 18:32.460
<i>We will learn from others' mistakes...</i>

18:35.264 --> 18:37.297
It's delicious.

18:37.299 --> 18:38.299
Okay.

18:39.935 --> 18:41.769
Is there anything happening to me?

18:41.771 --> 18:44.739
I don't think so.

18:44.741 --> 18:47.408
Oh, it has carrots in it.
I'm not gonna eat that.

18:47.410 --> 18:49.342
starting at the top.

18:54.449 --> 18:57.016
If I might have a private word.

18:57.018 --> 19:00.319
- It would be a very good pleasure.
- With Madam President.

19:00.321 --> 19:03.723
- Oh, okay. Sure!
- Okay.

19:03.725 --> 19:07.092
- What are you doing?
- I'm hungry.

19:07.094 --> 19:09.361
- Okay.
- Madam President,

19:09.363 --> 19:13.766
I have been reliably told
that war criminal Murman

19:13.768 --> 19:18.270
had the audacity to offer
you a $10 million bribe.

19:18.272 --> 19:21.673
Okay, well, that is ridiculous.

19:21.675 --> 19:25.443
I agree. It is so much
less than you are worth.

19:25.445 --> 19:27.812
I'm sorry, what?

19:27.814 --> 19:30.381
To ensure fair election,

19:30.383 --> 19:32.617
I would like to offer you

19:32.619 --> 19:35.386
a $15 million bribe.

19:35.388 --> 19:37.354
How dare you, sir!

19:37.356 --> 19:42.358
I will remind you that I am the former
president of the United States.

19:42.360 --> 19:46.162
You have lost a great deal
of face in my estimation.

19:46.164 --> 19:49.065
What I meant to say, of course,
is I would like to make

19:49.067 --> 19:53.437
a $15 million donation to your library.

19:56.074 --> 19:58.941
Well, that is something we can discuss

19:58.943 --> 20:03.078
as long as we understand that there
is, in fact, no understanding.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.089
I understand.

20:04.091 --> 20:07.115
Nikolai, you say that
you have $15 million.

20:07.117 --> 20:11.454
And yet you live in this... you
know, forgive the expression...

20:11.456 --> 20:14.355
but unbelievably shitty apartment.

20:14.357 --> 20:17.859
Ah, you see, because I have secret.

20:17.861 --> 20:20.227
- Come here. Come here.
- Oh, no, you can just tell me.

20:20.229 --> 20:22.296
- I can hear you fine from where I am.
- No, but come here.

20:22.298 --> 20:26.233
Come here. See, all
this is just for show.

20:26.235 --> 20:27.011
Uh-huh.

20:27.013 --> 20:29.337
In reality, although I
teach at the university

20:29.339 --> 20:30.771
and lead the opposition party,

20:30.773 --> 20:33.874
I control a telecommunication monopoly

20:33.876 --> 20:35.809
and own the most popular soccer team,

20:35.811 --> 20:38.011
the Tbilisi Bauxite Miners.

20:38.013 --> 20:39.613
Well, I gotta tell you, you really...

20:39.615 --> 20:41.515
you have a lot of people fooled.

20:41.517 --> 20:43.584
You know, I mean, even Doyle.

20:43.586 --> 20:47.220
- Oh, Secretary Doyle, he's so gullible.
- Yeah.

20:47.222 --> 20:51.056
If you told him that rava
ganavlis was chakapuli,

20:51.058 --> 20:53.826
he would eat it up and ask for seconds.

20:53.828 --> 20:56.796
I can only hope that rava
ganavlis is human shit.

20:56.798 --> 21:00.666
It is actually what you
vomit after eating shit.

21:02.069 --> 21:06.571
I like you, dimples.

21:11.311 --> 21:13.378
This is fucking beast!

21:13.380 --> 21:15.480
- It's very interesting.
- Hey, put that on.

21:15.482 --> 21:17.782
All the cool guys wear
the band's T-shirt.

21:17.784 --> 21:22.720
You know, the band's name
translates to Panzer Division.

21:22.722 --> 21:24.321
What?

21:30.930 --> 21:34.097
- I think maybe we should leave.
- Uh-huh.

21:34.099 --> 21:35.933
- Excuse us. Pardon me.
- Excuse me.

21:41.205 --> 21:43.406
<i>What did you think of Nikolai?</i>

21:43.408 --> 21:45.441
Can I be uncharacteristically
blunt with you?

21:45.443 --> 21:47.777
- I can't imagine what that...
- The poison?

21:47.779 --> 21:51.814
It did not engorge only his
face, if you know what I mean.

21:51.816 --> 21:53.683
- I think I do.
- It also engorged his penis

21:53.685 --> 21:56.518
and made it very unusual
texture of sea cucumber,

21:56.520 --> 21:59.220
- so it's great for vaginal orgasms.
- Okay, Minna.

21:59.222 --> 22:01.222
Which do you prefer, vaginal
or clitoral orgasms?

22:01.224 --> 22:03.692
You know, I just come
and get it over with.

22:03.694 --> 22:05.260
You can come just from your mind?

22:05.262 --> 22:07.596
What can I do to get
you to stop talking?

22:07.598 --> 22:08.730
Now?

22:10.167 --> 22:12.467
Well, you have to walk 25
miles for breast cancer

22:12.469 --> 22:14.702
and attend a WNBA game, but I
think we're gonna be okay.

22:14.704 --> 22:16.070
What are you doing? That's my hand.

22:16.072 --> 22:18.773
Amy, that morning when I heard you say

22:18.775 --> 22:21.341
that you were happiest
curled up next to me

22:21.343 --> 22:23.978
eating popcorn and
watching "Downton Abbey"

22:23.980 --> 22:25.119
I figured it all out.

22:25.121 --> 22:28.049
<i> The next governor
of Nevada, Buddy Calhoun!</i>

22:28.051 --> 22:30.584
I was just saying that for the cameras.

22:30.586 --> 22:32.385
Good evening, friends.

22:32.387 --> 22:34.120
After much soul searching,

22:34.122 --> 22:36.756
I am announcing tonight
that I'm withdrawing

22:36.758 --> 22:38.625
- from the race for governor.
- No!

22:38.627 --> 22:43.196
No, no, I need to get out of
this toxic world of politics

22:43.198 --> 22:48.467
and start to appreciate the things
that really do matter in life.

22:48.469 --> 22:51.570
<i>- No, Buddy!</i>
- Like the love of the wonderful woman

22:51.572 --> 22:53.171
who has agreed to be my wife.

22:53.173 --> 22:55.407
Amy, darling, come on out here, honey.

22:57.177 --> 22:58.611
Amy.

23:07.220 --> 23:10.989
Murman's leading by more votes than
there are people in the country.

23:10.991 --> 23:12.890
Yeah, maybe he's bussing
them in from Chicago.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.993
Oh, this is not gonna stand.

23:14.995 --> 23:17.561
This election's going down like Eleanor
Roosevelt at Dinah Shore Weekend.

23:17.965 --> 23:19.163
Hey, ma'am, your phone
is ringing right there.

23:19.165 --> 23:20.664
Well, do I work for you? Just answer it.

23:20.666 --> 23:21.732
- Okay.
- Right?

23:21.734 --> 23:23.299
Look, you call Nikolai now.

23:23.301 --> 23:25.035
You tell him to start spackling his face

23:25.037 --> 23:26.837
- for his inauguration speeches.
- Shit.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.038
- Gary, just get it.
- I will.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.840
Okay. Gary? Gar...

23:29.842 --> 23:33.043
What the fuck is that?

23:33.045 --> 23:34.878
Please hold. It was an accident.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.546
- Mike voted, too, Mike voted, too.
- What?!

23:36.548 --> 23:38.180
- I can't believe you!
- Stop it.

23:38.182 --> 23:40.883
You two ding-dongs look like you
fingered the Incredible Hulk.

23:40.885 --> 23:42.985
It's Murman. It's Murman.

23:42.987 --> 23:44.120
God.

23:45.456 --> 23:47.690
Hello, Murman.

23:47.692 --> 23:51.060
Madam President, I trust you
are watching the returns.

23:51.062 --> 23:53.896
Yes, yes, yes. Listen, Murman,

23:53.898 --> 23:57.799
as fond as I am of you personally

23:57.801 --> 24:03.672
I really cannot accept your generous
donation to my library fund.

24:03.674 --> 24:08.910
Madam President, let me tell you little story
about growing up in the Gurjaani countryside.

24:08.912 --> 24:11.212
You thought you caught a fish,
it turned out to be a tire.

24:11.214 --> 24:13.781
The tire was full of fish.
It's a great story.

24:13.783 --> 24:15.849
It's a very valuable lesson,
but I really gotta go.

24:15.851 --> 24:17.685
<i>20 million.</i>

24:17.687 --> 24:21.388
Perhaps there could be a
fountain or a snack shop.

24:21.390 --> 24:25.425
Well, Murman, that is a big tire

24:25.427 --> 24:27.394
with a fuckload of fish in it.

24:27.396 --> 24:31.931
But please understand that
whatever decision I make

24:31.933 --> 24:34.767
is gonna be in the interest of democracy

24:34.769 --> 24:35.599
and integrity...

24:35.601 --> 24:38.038
<i>Oh, yes, sounds good.
Great to hear. Bye!</i>

24:39.074 --> 24:41.207
- Murman?
- Mm-hmm.

24:41.209 --> 24:42.408
How much?

24:42.410 --> 24:44.543
20 million.

24:44.545 --> 24:48.814
- Yahtzee.
- I mean, they're both crooks.

24:48.816 --> 24:51.482
- What's the difference?
- $5 million.

24:51.484 --> 24:53.819
- Exactly.
- So, I have set the wheels in motion.

24:53.821 --> 24:56.487
In 10 minutes, there will
be a joint press conference

24:56.489 --> 25:00.025
in which we will announce
that the IEC and USA

25:00.027 --> 25:02.493
do not think that the elections
have been free and fair.

25:02.495 --> 25:03.694
Good luck.

25:05.331 --> 25:09.333
Well, that is very
strong language, Minna.

25:09.335 --> 25:10.236
Yes.

25:10.238 --> 25:12.937
Yes, and I wonder if we might
phrase it a different way.

25:12.939 --> 25:16.640
For instance, perhaps we would say
there have been certain irregularities

25:16.642 --> 25:18.542
- in this election, yeah.
- Yes!

25:18.544 --> 25:21.978
And that is not uncommon
for a young democracy.

25:21.980 --> 25:24.214
- Yes.
- And that, therefore,

25:24.216 --> 25:29.786
we believe that Murman is
the uncontested winner.

25:29.788 --> 25:32.455
Now, are you aware that
that is the exact opposite

25:32.457 --> 25:35.125
- of what you said just a moment ago?
- Yes.

25:35.127 --> 25:38.994
But I've had time to
reflect since that moment.

25:38.996 --> 25:44.933
My concern is I wonder if your
judgment is being clouded

25:44.935 --> 25:50.505
by your feelings that are brought
on by Nikolai's lumpy poison cock.

25:50.507 --> 25:54.541
Oh, my God. Well... well,
I will recuse myself.

25:54.543 --> 25:55.704
Well, you don't need
to recuse yourself.

25:55.706 --> 25:56.610
Immediately, I will resign.

25:56.612 --> 25:58.980
No, no, no, let's not overreact.

25:58.982 --> 26:00.547
Just take a deep breath, Minna.

26:00.549 --> 26:03.617
You're just in the middle of
what we in America call...

26:03.619 --> 26:06.187
- A difficult situation.
- a fuck fog.

26:06.189 --> 26:07.721
Yes, and that as well.

26:07.723 --> 26:10.457
Yeah, in Finland, we call this
the fever of the sausage.

26:10.459 --> 26:12.692
Okay, so, then you get it.

26:12.694 --> 26:14.294
You won't tell anyone, Selina?

26:14.296 --> 26:16.863
Thank you so much. You
are such a good friend.

26:16.865 --> 26:17.966
Oh, well...

26:17.968 --> 26:21.268
Sometimes I don't feel
worthy of this friendship.

26:21.270 --> 26:24.671
Mm, well, sometimes I
feel that way, too.

26:27.009 --> 26:28.774
Oh.

26:30.812 --> 26:32.778
<i>I mean, honestly,
that is the most</i>

26:32.780 --> 26:34.713
grotesque country I have ever been to

26:34.715 --> 26:36.982
- and I have been all over Florida.
- Mm-hmm.

26:36.984 --> 26:39.718
Hot in here, isn't it? Can we get them
to turn up the air in this cabin?

26:39.720 --> 26:42.121
- Yes, ma'am.
- My back is just killing me, too.

26:42.123 --> 26:44.723
Ma'am, you are not gonna believe this.

26:44.725 --> 26:47.225
- Mike.
- What?

26:47.227 --> 26:49.260
Eh, forget it, forget it.

26:49.262 --> 26:49.837
Look at this.

26:49.839 --> 26:51.562
Before Murman Shalikashvili
could be sworn in,

26:51.564 --> 26:53.397
<i>he was arrested on live television.</i>

26:53.399 --> 26:54.899
<i>Ooh.</i>

26:54.901 --> 26:58.469
Well, Murman's gonna have
a lot of great stories

26:58.471 --> 26:59.971
to tell the firing squad.

26:59.973 --> 27:02.605
seized by military elements
loyal to Oleg Petradze.

27:02.607 --> 27:03.941
Wait a minute, is that our guide?

27:03.943 --> 27:05.709
I think that's the guy I voted for.

27:05.711 --> 27:08.745
Wow, that's like Gary
becoming president.

27:08.747 --> 27:10.647
From the tea party.

27:10.649 --> 27:13.884
No. Oh, yeah, that is funny.

27:13.886 --> 27:15.518
Yeah.

27:15.520 --> 27:18.722
Also, I would be remiss not to
thank President Selina Meyer,

27:18.724 --> 27:23.359
who not only assisted in the long,
overdue ouster of Murman Shalikashvili,

27:23.361 --> 27:25.261
but also exposed his opponent

27:25.263 --> 27:27.997
as a ruthless, corporate oligarch

27:27.999 --> 27:33.269
and not the reformer some
had hoped he would be.

27:33.271 --> 27:36.571
Ma'am, the library fund
received a sizable donation

27:36.573 --> 27:39.774
from a Georgian AIDS
foundation late last night...

27:39.776 --> 27:42.844
- 60 million Georgian Lari.
- Mm.

27:42.846 --> 27:45.013
Yeah, that's worth about $20 million.

27:45.015 --> 27:48.216
Well, actually, since the coup, there's
been a slight dip in the exchange rate.

27:48.218 --> 27:53.420
It's now worth approximately $389,000.
Way to go, ma'am.

27:53.422 --> 27:58.625
Selina Meyer is truly the godmother
of the Caucasian Spring.

27:58.627 --> 28:00.560
- Madam President.
- Andrew.

28:00.562 --> 28:02.662
- Un-fucking-believable.
- Yep.

28:02.664 --> 28:05.099
Thank you, everyone.

28:05.101 --> 28:09.069
All I did was stay focused
on one simple goal...

28:09.071 --> 28:13.940
to free the peoples of the
world from totalitarianism

28:13.942 --> 28:18.912
through open and free and
transparent elections.

28:18.914 --> 28:20.813
And that, in a nutshell,

28:20.815 --> 28:23.883
is what I call the Meyer Doctrine.

28:23.885 --> 28:26.419
<i>Thank you.</i>

28:26.421 --> 28:28.787
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
