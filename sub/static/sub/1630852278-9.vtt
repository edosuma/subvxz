WEBVTT

00:00.667 --> 00:02.669
- Um...

00:02.669 --> 00:04.713
you do realize
what's happening here, right?

00:04.713 --> 00:06.256
- Yeah, you're getting fitted.

00:06.256 --> 00:08.091
- Yeah, for a wedding dress.

00:08.091 --> 00:10.260
For my wedding.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.637
To not you in six days.

00:12.637 --> 00:15.432
- Yeah, and that's--
yeah, congratulations.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.725
If you still want to
go through with it.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.561
- I do.
- I--I do.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.354
That's--I think we
just got married.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.355
- Ed, stop.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.816
- Okay, look.

00:24.816 --> 00:28.737
You might be happy with Kyle,
or you might be very, very sad.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.905
- Happy.
- Well, who knows?

00:30.905 --> 00:35.035
I--I'm just asking you to at
least be open-minded to not
going through with it.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.619
- Can we talk about this
somewhere else, please?

00:36.619 --> 00:38.580
- Okay.

00:38.580 --> 00:43.209
♪ Now, now,
now, now, now ♪

00:43.209 --> 00:47.047
- This is not okay, Ed.
Kyle would not be okay with
this.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.592
- Well, then he's not
right for you. I--I would
totally be okay with this.

00:50.592 --> 00:54.262
- With someone trying
to break up your engagement?

00:54.262 --> 00:57.474
- If it was the right
thing to do, yes. I'd be happy
for you--for both of you.

00:57.474 --> 01:02.312
- Look, I'm sorry about
Jeffrey, I really am.

01:02.312 --> 01:07.400
I know how much you loved
him and how bad it's messing you
up.

01:07.400 --> 01:12.072
- I'm just saying I'm not
the old me. I'm different.

01:12.072 --> 01:15.200
- Kyle's and my motto
is brutal honesty.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.495
- Well, honestly,
that's kind of a brutal motto.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.289
I mean, our motto was--was fun.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.416
- No, it wasn't.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.543
You were always
borderline-depressed.

01:25.543 --> 01:27.796
- No, I wasn't.
I--I was thinking.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.006
I--I have a very
serious thinking face.

01:30.006 --> 01:32.008
- Yeah, because you're always
thinking about bad shit.

01:32.008 --> 01:35.595
- Yeah, okay, but in my defense,
bad shit was happening to me,

01:35.595 --> 01:38.389
and I--I just didn't have the
tools to know how to adjust,

01:38.389 --> 01:41.518
but I recognize that
now and I've changed.

01:41.518 --> 01:44.479
- Look, people don't change, Ed.

01:44.479 --> 01:47.023
I don't think I've ever met
anyone who's ever changed.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.859
-
Son of Sam.

01:49.859 --> 01:51.653
- What about him, Ed?

01:51.653 --> 01:53.738
- Shot a dozen people and now he
teaches the gospel to inmates.

01:53.738 --> 01:54.614
People can grow.

01:58.785 --> 02:03.414
- I'm happy for you, Ed.
Seriously, I am.

02:03.414 --> 02:05.875
And I'd want nothing more

02:05.875 --> 02:08.128
than for us to be
able to be friends.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.421
- No, don't give me
the friends line.

02:10.421 --> 02:12.382
I mean, how--how does
that even play out?

02:12.382 --> 02:14.342
Come on, have you really
thought that through?

02:14.342 --> 02:18.138
"Hey, it's Ed, the guy that you
left for your current husband.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.014
How are you?
Would you like to grab a meal?"

02:20.014 --> 02:22.183
- "Of course,
that sounds like a great idea.

02:22.183 --> 02:24.102
Let's grab a Friday fish fry

02:24.102 --> 02:25.645
at supper club
and I'll invite my husband."

02:25.645 --> 02:27.480
- "Oh, that sounds lovely.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.982
Will you tell him to bring his
kids who were supposed to be
mine?"

02:28.982 --> 02:31.109
- I can't.
I'm sorry, I--

02:31.109 --> 02:32.944
Ken, please, please.
- I'm sorry, I can't do it.

02:32.944 --> 02:35.196
All right, well,
we'll pick this up later.

02:35.196 --> 02:37.782
- First, I'd like to thank you
for agreeing to see me.

02:37.782 --> 02:40.160
- I did not agree to see you.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.661
You called and asked
for an appointment,

02:41.661 --> 02:44.664
I told you I wasn't
taking any new patients,

02:44.664 --> 02:46.958
and you have just
shown up anyway.

02:46.958 --> 02:51.462
- Well, regardless, I appreciate
you making room for me.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.923
- I have not made room for you.

02:53.923 --> 02:56.384
I am having my lunch.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.678
During my quiet time.

02:58.678 --> 03:01.472
- Hmm.
Anyway, here we are.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.642
- Here you are.

03:06.728 --> 03:10.106
-
Look, Doctor, I'm just--

03:10.106 --> 03:14.152
I'm worried about my kid.

03:14.152 --> 03:18.072
- Well, you're probably very
much alike. You've both been
through a lot.

03:18.072 --> 03:20.867
I would suggest the best thing
is to try to take care of
yourselves.

03:20.867 --> 03:25.288
You know, do some walking.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.457
Have a hike.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.250
Take a bath instead of a shower.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.211
-
A bath?

03:31.211 --> 03:33.922
You want me take a fucking bath

03:33.922 --> 03:36.299
after what happened to
my husband and Jeffrey

03:36.299 --> 03:39.260
and now maybe my last son?

03:39.260 --> 03:41.971
What if this
happened in your family, hmm?

03:41.971 --> 03:45.558
What if this happened in your
family and you only had one kid
left?

03:45.558 --> 03:47.393
What would you do, Doctor?

03:50.897 --> 03:55.193
- You don't have an appointment
with me and I don't have an
appointment with you.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.737
So I have half a
sandwich left here.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.447
Would you mind
coming to the point?

03:59.447 --> 04:01.449
- Oh, God.

04:01.449 --> 04:05.995
I just want to know what is
going through my son's head?

04:05.995 --> 04:09.499
I want to find out
why he's acting erratically,

04:09.499 --> 04:11.584
what I can do to help,
and what you can tell me.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.378
- You must understand

04:13.378 --> 04:17.048
that I am not allowed to divulge
what your son has told me.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.133
- But I'm his mother.

04:22.845 --> 04:26.266
What if I were to promise you

04:26.266 --> 04:30.687
to keep your breach of my son's
confidence completely
confidential?

04:32.563 --> 04:33.731
Oh, for fuck's sake.

04:33.731 --> 04:36.567
Is my son crazy?

04:36.567 --> 04:38.987
- Crazy is a pejorative term.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.530
Crazy is not a pejorative term!

04:40.530 --> 04:43.491
Is my son crazy or not?

04:43.491 --> 04:45.451
- A little crazy.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.161
But good crazy.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.006
- Would you be willing
to say that in court?

05:00.842 --> 05:02.385
- You couldn't pay me enough.

05:07.640 --> 05:11.019
Could you?

05:11.019 --> 05:13.438
- Yeah, but it's like
Kendra named Kyle

05:13.438 --> 05:16.357
the starting quarterback
after three preseason games

05:16.357 --> 05:18.693
and she's not
giving me a chance.

05:18.693 --> 05:22.113
- Well, you had your shot, man.
You were starting quarterback
for years.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.823
Never took her to the playoffs.

05:23.823 --> 05:27.493
- I--I didn't have any
What?

05:27.493 --> 05:30.246
- I--I didn't have the
weapons to compete.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.623
Your play calling sucked.

05:32.623 --> 05:36.252
- Okay, well, I have a new
offensive coordinator, Eckhart
Tolle.

05:36.252 --> 05:39.505
- Oh, Coach Tolle.
That's your Lombardi?

05:39.505 --> 05:42.091
That's who's gonna
get you your ring?

05:42.091 --> 05:44.844
- A ring--ring, that's-- dude,
that's--that's where I fucked
up.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.888
I need to get her
an engagement ring.

05:46.888 --> 05:50.141
- What? - A ring would show her
that I'm serious.

05:50.141 --> 05:53.686
And she--she's not buying it
right now 'cause it all just
seems so off-the-cuff.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.773
- Ed, it's officially starting
to get embarrassing.

05:56.773 --> 06:00.151
- Let's just say you
do propose, right?

06:00.151 --> 06:03.446
And for some reason
she does say yes.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.532
What--what's the, uh, what's the
best man situation looking like?

06:09.452 --> 06:11.871
- I--I mean...

06:11.871 --> 06:15.166
you know.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.710
- I mean, no, I don't, I don't
know. That's why I asked.

06:17.710 --> 06:23.466
- I mean, I--I think my best man
should be my brother.

06:26.803 --> 06:29.389
- What if he can't make it?

06:31.057 --> 06:34.018
- I--I--I'm aware
Jeffrey's dead.

06:34.018 --> 06:36.813
Yeah, no, it's more of, like,
a symbolic gesture.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.649
- Right.

06:39.649 --> 06:43.986
- I--it doesn't matter anyway
'cause a ring is what, five
grand?

06:43.986 --> 06:48.699
And I owe five grand to that
asshole for Jeffrey's debt, so.

06:48.699 --> 06:52.078
- Thought about asking your mom
for the money?

06:52.078 --> 06:55.081
- No, all she talks about
these days is how we're broke.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.750
And she's, like, about
to have a nervous breakdown

06:57.750 --> 07:00.253
and I--I just don't want
to put this on her.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.047
-- I got 10
- K you can borrow.

07:03.047 --> 07:04.841
Like, borrow.

07:04.841 --> 07:07.427
- You--you just have $10,000?

07:07.427 --> 07:11.931
- Not on me, no, but the
Bears are a lock tonight.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.975
Getting six and a hook at home.

07:13.975 --> 07:17.395
The Bears, at home, when the
temperature's under 48 degrees,

07:17.395 --> 07:20.189
are 17 and 3 against the spread
in the last six years.

07:20.189 --> 07:22.733
- Didn't you quit betting

07:22.733 --> 07:24.527
because you had to go
to Gamblers Anonymous

07:24.527 --> 07:27.155
because you're a
degenerate gambler?

07:27.155 --> 07:29.907
- Not entirely true, no.
Okay.

07:29.907 --> 07:32.743
- I quit gambling because, uh, I
was losing a lot more than I was
winning.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.370
Oh.
- Right?

07:34.370 --> 07:37.165
Which makes you look like a
degenerate gambler even if
you're not.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.208
- And when you got
back into betting

07:39.208 --> 07:41.377
you promised you wouldn't
go over 20 bucks.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.838
- Right, unless it
was an emergency,

07:43.838 --> 07:46.841
which, I mean, this is pretty
obviously an emergency.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.926
- So you--you got a bookie.
- Uh-huh.

07:48.926 --> 07:52.472
-- Who will take on a 10
- K bet
from a guy who's unemployed?

07:52.472 --> 07:54.640
- Okay, look, Coop.

07:54.640 --> 07:59.187
Unlike you, not everyone judges
people off of their job status,
okay?

07:59.187 --> 08:01.272
Is he a bookie?
Yes.

08:01.272 --> 08:02.607
But he's a nice bookie.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.192
- Oh!
Okay?

08:04.192 --> 08:06.694
Even his leg-breakers
who make his collections?

08:06.694 --> 08:10.656
Also nice people.
It comes from the top down.

08:10.656 --> 08:12.909
Seriously, he even asks me
how my kids are sometimes.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.243
- What kids?

08:14.243 --> 08:16.078
- Well, I tell all bookies
that I have kids

08:16.078 --> 08:18.956
just so they think twice
before harming me.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.959
- Okay, no, no, I can't--
I can't let you bet.

08:21.959 --> 08:24.712
- But if we don't get this
dough, you're gonna lose another
finger.

08:24.712 --> 08:28.174
I mean, how else
are we gonna get this money?

08:28.174 --> 08:29.884
- No-

08:29.884 --> 08:31.928
I'm not gonna enable you.
You're an addict.

08:31.928 --> 08:35.139
- And a fucking dope.
Nice leg breakers.

08:35.139 --> 08:39.477
- A fucking dope
who just put 10 large on...

08:39.477 --> 08:41.687
da Bears.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.356
- Wait, wait, you--you
just placed the bet?

08:43.356 --> 08:45.691
- Technology's crazy, man.
- No, no--

08:45.691 --> 08:49.153
- So the game is at 7:20. I say
we meet at my house at 7:00?

08:49.153 --> 08:50.404
- No.
Cancel it, man.

08:50.404 --> 08:51.864
I--I'm serious, okay?
What if you lose?

08:51.864 --> 08:53.282
- What if--
Dude.

08:53.282 --> 08:55.910
You're the one who keeps telling
me "what if" is about the future

08:55.910 --> 08:58.037
and it's all about the now.

08:58.037 --> 09:02.833
And right now, I
know we're gonna win.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.669
So let's go Bears.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.420
Whoo!

09:06.420 --> 09:10.633
Let's go Bears!
Whoo!

09:10.633 --> 09:12.468
- I don't know where he's going,
I drove him here.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.109
Another chance...

09:30.903 --> 09:33.239
Got it!
