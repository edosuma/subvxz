All right, let's do this.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.779
Ah, okay.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.047
Picnic day, Sammy.

00:13.047 --> 00:14.715
Let's pack up.

00:14.715 --> 00:17.551
Plates made from 100%
recycled leaves.

00:17.551 --> 00:20.621
Spoons made
from 100% recycled plates,

recycled old newspapers.

Sammy, don't be

00:40.074 --> 00:42.910
People like us started pollution
and we can stop it.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.478
All it takes to save
the environment

00:44.478 --> 00:46.114
is for each of us
to do our part.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.281
Actually...
(screams)

00:47.281 --> 00:48.816
(coughing, hacking)

00:48.816 --> 00:50.951
Actually, that kind
of thinking will lead us

00:50.951 --> 00:52.620
to a trash-tastrophe.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.588
Oscar the Grouch!

00:54.588 --> 00:56.124
No, I'm Adam the Conover.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.758
Less a grouch,
more a cultural critic,

00:57.758 --> 00:59.760
and this is
"Adam Ruins Everything."

♪♪

01:10.638 --> 01:11.772
Look, trash man,

01:11.772 --> 01:13.274
if you're here to lecture me
on going green,

01:13.274 --> 01:14.475
put a lid on it.

01:14.475 --> 01:15.809
That's a trash can joke.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.745
If I use green products,
pick up my own litter,

01:17.745 --> 01:19.447
and make small
sacrifices in my life,

01:19.447 --> 01:20.981
I will stop
climate change.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.416
No, you won't.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.418
Those things will
never be enough.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.520
And that personal
responsibility you feel

01:26.520 --> 01:29.790
is just the result of
an old ad campaign.

01:29.790 --> 01:33.327
(man)
Some people have a deep
abiding respect

01:33.327 --> 01:36.464
for the natural beauty
that was once this country.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.700
And some people don't.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.604
People start pollution.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.473
People can stop it.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.677
I remember that ad.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.812
It was the moment I realized
it's everyone's responsibility

01:51.812 --> 01:52.980
to keep the planet clean.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.183
Well, everything
about it is wrong.

01:55.183 --> 01:56.717
What you talking
about, Adam?

01:56.717 --> 01:57.818
"Diff'rent Strokes."

01:57.818 --> 01:59.720
First of all,
the "Indian" in the ad,

01:59.720 --> 02:01.155
Iron Eyes Cody,

02:01.155 --> 02:04.958
was actually an Italian man
named Espera de Corti.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.960
This guy lied
for his entire life

02:06.960 --> 02:08.662
about his heritage
and was basically

02:08.662 --> 02:11.031
the Native-American
Rachel Dolezal.

02:11.031 --> 02:12.533
How...

02:12.533 --> 02:15.068
(Italian accent)
did I get away with this
for so long?

02:15.068 --> 02:16.470
(sighs)

02:16.470 --> 02:18.005
And that's not even
the worst part.

02:18.005 --> 02:20.341
The filthy truth is,
this message was designed

02:20.341 --> 02:22.976
by the can-and-bottle industry
to shift the blame

02:22.976 --> 02:24.545
from them onto you.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.347
Come on, I'll show you.

02:26.347 --> 02:29.583
For decades, we had an effective
system for reducing litter.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.320
After people finished their
soda, they returned the bottles

02:32.320 --> 02:35.256
and the manufacturers would
wash and reuse them.

02:36.824 --> 02:40.194
Cutting production waste is
out of this world, Daddy-O.

02:40.194 --> 02:43.163
But in the 1950s, a group
of greedy companies switched

02:43.163 --> 02:46.200
to disposable cans and bottles
to cut costs.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.270
One man's trash...

02:49.270 --> 02:51.605
is that same man's treasure.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.207
After they went disposable,
we started

02:53.207 --> 02:55.776
going through twice
as many bottles and cans.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.413
We can't have
this much trash.

02:59.413 --> 03:03.050
The switch caused so much
outrage that in 1953,

03:03.050 --> 03:04.452
Vermont introduced a law

03:04.452 --> 03:06.920
that actually banned
disposable bottles.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.357
Our farms are filling up
with bottles

03:09.357 --> 03:12.693
and our big, beautiful cows
are eating 'em and dying!

03:12.693 --> 03:14.061
(cow mooing)
(gasps)

03:14.061 --> 03:15.696
This was actually
happening.

03:15.696 --> 03:19.467
A disposable container ban
is utterly essential.

03:19.467 --> 03:22.102
Ha!
He really milked it.

03:22.102 --> 03:24.472
Oh, man,
I love dad jokes.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.806
Their business model
threatened,

03:25.806 --> 03:27.908
the container industry
whipped up a plan.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.744
People are blaming us
for the litter problem.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.080
Well, I won't stand
for it!

03:33.080 --> 03:34.748
(crowd exclaiming)
Hear, hear!

03:34.748 --> 03:37.318
Coca-Cola is tired of
making a bunch of garbage

03:37.318 --> 03:39.920
and then getting yelled at
for making all that garbage.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.255
Philip Morris concurs.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.123
When you think about it,
it's the customer's fault

03:43.123 --> 03:45.092
for throwing
our garbage away.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.627
(man)
Dixie Cup agrees.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.462
We'll blame
the customer.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.764
(man 2)
I know a better word
for them.

03:50.764 --> 03:51.965
Litterbugs.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.334
(cheering and applause)

03:53.334 --> 03:55.636
And so, with the help
of over 20 companies,

03:55.636 --> 03:58.171
they founded the original
anti-litter group,

03:58.171 --> 04:00.341
Keep America Beautiful.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.943
Wait, Keep America Beautiful was
founded by litter companies?

04:02.943 --> 04:05.613
Yep, these companies
actually popularized

04:05.613 --> 04:07.114
the term "litterbug"

04:07.114 --> 04:09.950
and shifted the litter blame
from themselves onto you.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.452
And all of this culminated

04:11.452 --> 04:14.021
in Keep America Beautiful's
most famous ad,

04:14.021 --> 04:15.523
the crying Indian.

04:15.523 --> 04:18.526
No.
No, not that beautiful ad.

04:18.526 --> 04:19.960
I'm afraid so.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.129
The most famous PSA
in history

04:22.129 --> 04:24.832
was actually a piece
of corporate propaganda.

04:27.134 --> 04:29.537
And all of this
totally worked.

04:29.537 --> 04:31.138
Bottle bans were struck down

04:31.138 --> 04:33.341
and Americans started
blaming ourselves

04:33.341 --> 04:34.942
for the litter problem.

04:34.942 --> 04:38.312
Eating that can didn't kill
Bessie...

04:38.312 --> 04:40.448
I killed Bessie!

04:40.448 --> 04:43.851
I'm a litterbug!

04:43.851 --> 04:46.387
And today, we're stuck
with disposables,

04:46.387 --> 04:49.122
and every year,
over 100 billion

04:49.122 --> 04:51.492
beverage containers
end up wasted,

04:51.492 --> 04:53.661
either in landfills
or incinerators,

04:53.661 --> 04:55.896
or yeah,
just plain littered.

04:58.366 --> 05:00.200
Now, look,
I want to be clear.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.235
If you litter,
you're a jerk.

05:02.235 --> 05:05.138
But these companies threw out
an effective recycling system

05:05.138 --> 05:08.208
and instead asked us
to pick up their trash,

05:08.208 --> 05:10.243
and their marketing campaign
helped create

05:10.243 --> 05:12.079
an entire green culture
that blames

05:12.079 --> 05:13.814
individuals for pollution

05:13.814 --> 05:16.049
rather than the companies
making it.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.018
That's terrible.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.421
Well, from now on, I'm going
to stop supporting companies

05:20.421 --> 05:22.590
that pollute and I'll only
buy green products,

05:22.590 --> 05:23.691
like my hybrid.

05:23.691 --> 05:26.193
And pretty soon,
I'm going electric

05:26.193 --> 05:28.396
with a brand-new Tesla.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.197
Wait, you already have
a hybrid

05:30.197 --> 05:32.733
but you're gonna buy
a brand-new electric car?

05:32.733 --> 05:34.868
That choice can actually hurt
the environment.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.938
Hurt the environment!
Yay!

05:37.938 --> 05:39.206
Oh, she learns quick.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.617
You serve me well,
hybrid.

05:49.617 --> 05:53.186
But still, you burn
some gas and so...

05:53.186 --> 05:55.088
you disgust me.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.626
Soon, I'll be slashing
my carbon footprint

05:58.626 --> 06:00.761
with a sexy new Tesla.

06:00.761 --> 06:03.263
400,000 preorders
can't be wrong.

06:03.263 --> 06:04.732
I cannot wait!

06:04.732 --> 06:05.866
Huh.
Ah!

06:05.866 --> 06:07.735
You can and should wait.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.470
If you're selling that
perfectly good car

06:09.470 --> 06:12.473
to buy a brand-new Tesla,
you're not doing a good deed.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.408
You're just buying
a bright, shiny,

06:14.408 --> 06:16.376
ecologically problematic...

06:16.376 --> 06:17.945
toy!

06:17.945 --> 06:20.448
What just happened?
Where are we?

06:20.448 --> 06:22.282
We're in your
daughter's toys.

06:22.282 --> 06:25.252
I know, it's a little forced,
but I really like stop motion.

06:25.252 --> 06:27.421
Adam, how could
a Tesla be bad?

06:27.421 --> 06:28.722
It's electric.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.090
Boogie-woogie-woogie-woogie!

06:30.090 --> 06:32.092
Yep, electric cars
like the Tesla

06:32.092 --> 06:33.727
are the sexy new thing.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.829
Ooh, wow.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.065
Check out his brand-new
electric car.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.232
That's hot.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.768
Like our planet.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.603
And a big part of their appeal
is that car companies

06:42.603 --> 06:44.171
have marketed them as greener

06:44.171 --> 06:46.440
than a pocket square
on St. Patty's Day.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.842
(man)
A road trip
completely sponsored

06:48.842 --> 06:50.110
by the power of the sun.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.914
(man 2)
100% electric Nissan Leaf.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.415
Innovation for the planet.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.950
Innovation for all.

06:56.950 --> 07:01.088
Wow! If I buy a Nissan,
polar bears will love me!

07:01.088 --> 07:05.325
Yeah, turns out that message
is pretty sketchy.

07:05.325 --> 07:08.428
Look, electric cars are more
energy-efficient than gas cars,

07:08.428 --> 07:10.931
but where do you think
that energy comes from?

07:10.931 --> 07:12.099
It comes from nature.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.634
As soon as I get
a Tesla,

07:13.634 --> 07:16.303
I'll drive with
all the colors of the wind.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.471
"Pocahontas."

07:17.471 --> 07:20.107
Nope, it comes
from the energy grid.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.875
If you buy
an electric car today,

07:21.875 --> 07:23.376
you're just shifting
your fuel source

07:23.376 --> 07:26.880
from the gas pump
to a power plant.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.182
And if those power plants
burn coal,

07:29.182 --> 07:32.152
driving an electric car
can actually put more CO2

07:32.152 --> 07:34.154
into the air
than a hybrid.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.523
According to one study,

07:35.523 --> 07:38.892
even if a third of all drivers
switch to electric cars,

07:38.892 --> 07:42.329
the carbon savings
could be tiny.

07:42.329 --> 07:43.897
But that's just
right now.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.233
Soon, all electricity
will come from solar,

07:46.233 --> 07:48.869
wind, water,
and... heart.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.470
Go planet!

07:50.470 --> 07:53.507
Yeah, but that dream is
a long way off.

07:53.507 --> 07:56.376
In fact, your new Tesla
will probably break down

07:56.376 --> 07:57.645
before that happens,

07:57.645 --> 07:59.246
and in the meantime,
you're gonna be pumping out

07:59.246 --> 08:01.048
a ton of CO2
from everything

08:01.048 --> 08:02.983
that goes into just
making the car.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.351
Wait, what?

08:04.351 --> 08:05.986
Aren't electric cars
made from plants

08:05.986 --> 08:07.154
and old Ralph Nader
stickers?

08:07.154 --> 08:08.355
You wish.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.524
Building an electric car
requires steel, copper,

08:10.524 --> 08:12.693
and aluminum,
just like a regular car,

08:12.693 --> 08:15.495
but worse, their batteries
are made of rare metals

08:15.495 --> 08:17.598
that take intensive mining.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.866
Hey, stop that!

08:18.866 --> 08:20.200
The floors are bamboo!

08:21.569 --> 08:24.071
And even the mere act of
putting the car together

08:24.071 --> 08:25.873
produces greenhouse gases.

08:27.274 --> 08:30.177
Add that up and if we all
ditched our trusty old cars

08:30.177 --> 08:31.745
in favor of brand-new
electrics,

08:31.745 --> 08:35.549
we'd actually end up
increasing our carbon footprint.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.217
Wayne, meet Mike Berners-Lee.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.886
He's an expert
on carbon emissions

08:38.886 --> 08:41.354
who's written extensively
on this subject.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.456
That's an expert?
Looks like a toy.

08:43.456 --> 08:46.226
Oh, you just have
to pull his lever.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.028
Hello, Wayne.
Adam is right.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.963
While electric cars are
more efficient,

08:49.963 --> 08:52.600
manufacturing typically adds
about 50%

08:52.600 --> 08:54.134
to the total carbon footprint,

08:54.134 --> 08:56.103
so if you buy a new car
too often,

08:56.103 --> 08:58.271
you could completely undo all
the carbon savings

08:58.271 --> 09:00.440
that you might get
from buying an electric car.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.810
If you really...
(voice slows, stops)

09:02.810 --> 09:05.879
Whoops,
needs another yank.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.547
If you really want to help save
the environment,

09:07.547 --> 09:10.417
the best thing you can do is
to reduce the amount you drive

09:10.417 --> 09:13.420
and to drive your current car
as long as possible,

09:13.420 --> 09:15.222
provided it's reasonably
efficient.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.890
But if your car is beyond repair

09:16.890 --> 09:18.926
and you absolutely need
to buy a new one,

09:18.926 --> 09:21.929
then go ahead, buy yourself
a nice small electric car,

09:21.929 --> 09:23.130
perhaps even a used one.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.765
I never thought
of it that way.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.066
Anything else
I should know?

09:26.066 --> 09:27.234
The cow says...

09:27.234 --> 09:28.568
(cow mooing)

09:28.568 --> 09:29.937
Oh, guess that's it.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.939
Wayne, when it comes
to saving the planet,

09:31.939 --> 09:34.942
the efficiency of your car's
engine is small potatoes.

09:34.942 --> 09:40.280
The real problem is
that Americans bought
17.5 million cars last year

09:40.280 --> 09:44.117
and drove a total
of 2.7 trillion miles.

09:44.117 --> 09:47.955
I'm sorry, but buying another
car just isn't gonna fix that.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.458
But I just want a Tesla!

09:51.458 --> 09:52.693
And I want to help
the environment.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.294
Well, you can't
have both.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.462
And if you're not careful,

09:55.462 --> 09:57.130
these companies will
use that desire

09:57.130 --> 09:59.266
to help the planet
to sell you more stuff

09:59.266 --> 10:00.801
that's hurting the planet.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.303
Buying green products won't
solve the problem,

10:03.303 --> 10:05.939
because buying stuff is
part of the problem.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.276
We need to reduce what we buy
and reuse what we have.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.344
We can't shop our way
out of this.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.783
Fine, I won't buy
a Tesla.

10:15.783 --> 10:18.285
In fact,
I'll do you one better.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.887
I'll walk everywhere.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.221
Yeah, walking.

10:21.221 --> 10:24.157
A surefire way
to stop climate change.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.159
Oh, this one's actually
really interesting.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.561
In many cases, walking can
actually increase

10:28.561 --> 10:30.497
your carbon footprint.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.165
If I wasn't a pacifist,

10:32.165 --> 10:34.702
I would pass my fist
through your face.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.674
We'll walk
to the grocery store, Sammy.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.642
That way, we'll reduce
our carbon footprint

10:42.642 --> 10:44.577
and be guilt-free.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.880
Ahh, ahh!
Ah, yes.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.215
People today are obsessed

10:48.215 --> 10:50.751
with reducing their carbon
footprints, but the fact is,

10:50.751 --> 10:53.220
that's a lot harder
than you probably think.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.321
What are you talking about?

10:54.321 --> 10:55.488
It's everyone's
responsibility

10:55.488 --> 10:57.424
to use as little
fossil fuel as possible.

10:57.424 --> 11:00.327
I even won the low footprint
competition at work.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.429
And all because
I love to walk.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.264
Walking is the greenest
thing you can do.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.532
Not always.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.868
In fact, our carbon system
is so complex

11:07.868 --> 11:10.203
that a lot of what
we think will reduce
our carbon footprints

11:10.203 --> 11:12.205
actually makes
things worse.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.707
Let me explain.

11:13.707 --> 11:14.942
Ugh!

11:14.942 --> 11:16.844
I gotta stop hanging out
in trash cans.

11:16.844 --> 11:20.280
Anyway, let's say you and Sammy
go to a fast food place.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.284
You each ate a burger
and went for a walk,

11:24.284 --> 11:26.286
so the burger fueled
your walk,

11:26.286 --> 11:28.621
but that burger
came from a cow

11:28.621 --> 11:31.024
and the cow got most
of its fuel from grain

11:31.024 --> 11:33.626
and cows need a lot of
grain to survive,

11:33.626 --> 11:36.463
and producing all that grain
takes a ton of energy,

11:36.463 --> 11:39.366
which often comes
from coal, gas, and oil,

11:39.366 --> 11:41.634
AKA fossil fuels.
(cow mooing)

11:41.634 --> 11:44.772
You have to burn
54 calories of fossil fuel

11:44.772 --> 11:47.607
just to make one calorie
of beef protein.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.910
And because we have
so many cars and farms,

11:49.910 --> 11:52.112
agriculture accounts
for up to one-third

11:52.112 --> 11:54.281
of all greenhouse
gas emissions.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.319
Add all that together
and this fuel can actually have

11:59.319 --> 12:01.955
a larger carbon footprint
than this fuel,

12:01.955 --> 12:04.491
so if your walk to work
is powered by burgers,

12:04.491 --> 12:07.394
you're not a hybrid,
you're a gas guzzler.

12:08.661 --> 12:11.498
Hey, well, joke's
on you, Al Bore.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.833
I'm a vegetarian.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.802
Asparagus powered
my walk today,

12:14.802 --> 12:17.170
and made my pee
smell fantastic.

12:17.170 --> 12:20.941
Well, asparagus can actually be
one of the most wasteful foods.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.343
Wait, what?
This was likely flown

12:23.343 --> 12:25.145
a long distance to get here,

12:25.145 --> 12:27.815
and air-freighting produce
is a hundred times worse

12:27.815 --> 12:30.583
for the environment
than shipping by boat.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.485
Get your asparagus!

12:32.485 --> 12:36.356
An exotic delicacy
from a faraway land!

12:36.356 --> 12:38.691
And when they're out of season,
the same is likely true

12:38.691 --> 12:41.929
of baby corn, baby carrots,
snap peas, small green beans,

12:41.929 --> 12:44.031
okra, shelled peas, lettuce,
blueberries,

12:44.031 --> 12:47.034
raspberries, and strawberries.

12:47.034 --> 12:49.169
The truth is,
when you grab a vegetable,

12:49.169 --> 12:51.004
it can be almost
impossible to tell

12:51.004 --> 12:53.040
how big its carbon footprint
really is.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.942
Even in a fancy
organic store,

12:54.942 --> 12:58.445
the produce aisle is full
of carbon landmines.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.480
(explosion)

13:00.480 --> 13:03.016
There has to be something
carbon-free in here.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.717
Oh, what about bananas?

13:04.717 --> 13:06.286
I read that they're
shipped by boat,

13:06.286 --> 13:07.554
they pack a ton
of nutrients,

13:07.554 --> 13:09.222
and they come
in their own packaging.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.457
Yep, all true.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.825
Yes!

13:11.825 --> 13:15.628
From now on, my "shh" is
bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.964
Gwen Stefani.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.499
But even bananas
aren't perfect.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.334
But you just...

13:21.334 --> 13:23.904
Ahh!
They're still part
of the same system

13:23.904 --> 13:25.572
that's destroying
our planet.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.908
If you really want to calculate
your carbon footprint,

13:27.908 --> 13:30.343
you have to look
at the whole picture.

13:31.744 --> 13:34.414
Think about the banana company's
corporate offices,

13:34.414 --> 13:35.983
which create
their own emissions,

13:35.983 --> 13:38.685
like the coffee they supply
to their employees,

13:38.685 --> 13:42.055
coffee that required water
and energy to grow and ship

13:42.055 --> 13:44.257
and that shipping company
provided uniforms

13:44.257 --> 13:47.594
for their drivers,
uniforms that required zippers,

13:47.594 --> 13:49.162
zippers made out of metals

13:49.162 --> 13:51.498
which needed to be mined
from the earth.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.034
And during lunch at the zipper
mine, what did they serve?

13:54.034 --> 13:55.535
Bananas.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.769
(beep)

13:56.769 --> 13:59.940
We live in an infinite web
of carbon pollution.

13:59.940 --> 14:03.210
The number of variables at play
is so vast,

14:03.210 --> 14:06.179
they're impossible for a single
person to even calculate,

14:06.179 --> 14:08.081
let alone reduce.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.184
Tell me, stock boy.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.086
Is the zinc on the zippers
of the factory workers

14:13.086 --> 14:15.122
who drove the trucks
that shipped the coffee

14:15.122 --> 14:16.756
to the banana corporate
offices mined

14:16.756 --> 14:18.858
in an eco-friendly manner?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.127
Tell me!

14:20.127 --> 14:22.562
You're hurting me.
Ah!

14:22.562 --> 14:24.264
I'm sorry, Trent.
Let's go.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.632
Why are you
doing this?

14:25.632 --> 14:26.967
I'm just trying
to help.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.635
And that is commendable,

14:28.635 --> 14:31.138
but the fact is,
this problem is way too big

14:31.138 --> 14:34.107
for our individual
consumer choices to solve.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.210
Our entire way of life
is the problem.

14:39.646 --> 14:43.083
Some time ago, humanity
discovered vast deposits

14:43.083 --> 14:47.220
of fuel buried deep
within the earth.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.822
We learned to extract it,
burn it for energy,

14:49.822 --> 14:51.491
and release it
into the air,

14:51.491 --> 14:53.460
and about 150 years ago,

14:53.460 --> 14:55.828
we rebuilt our entire
civilization

14:55.828 --> 14:57.965
around that energy source.

14:57.965 --> 15:00.900
We burn it to travel,
we burn it to eat,

15:00.900 --> 15:02.835
we burn it to live.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.638
Fossil fuels brought about
one of the greatest increases

15:05.638 --> 15:08.175
in standard of living
in human history.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.177
We could never go back.

15:10.177 --> 15:12.779
But by burning
this incredible fuel source,

15:12.779 --> 15:15.848
we are also inexorably
heating the earth.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.684
2015 was the hottest year

15:17.684 --> 15:21.088
since we started
keeping records in 1880.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.123
And thanks to rising
ocean temperatures,

15:23.123 --> 15:25.092
average sea levels
have already risen

15:25.092 --> 15:27.027
about eight inches.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.929
And we're in
for a lot worse.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.298
This is Dale Jamieson.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.466
He's a professor of
Environmental Studies at NYU.

15:33.466 --> 15:36.970
Wayne, we've already done so
much damage to the atmosphere

15:36.970 --> 15:39.306
that we'll be lucky
if we can hold the warming

15:39.306 --> 15:41.508
to two degrees
Celsius.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.676
Two degrees?
Well, that's just the difference

15:43.676 --> 15:45.678
between a jacket and a slightly
lighter jacket.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.147
Not to the earth,
it isn't.

15:47.147 --> 15:50.984
Just two degrees of warming
could cause huge draughts,

15:50.984 --> 15:54.521
massive wildfires,
the loss of many species,

15:54.521 --> 15:56.889
the collapse of
our agricultural productivity,

15:56.889 --> 15:58.725
and the rising sea levels

15:58.725 --> 16:01.061
could make our coastal cities
uninhabitable.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.396
And remember,
two degrees of warming

16:03.396 --> 16:05.999
is the best we can
realistically hope for.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.235
The question isn't,
will warming happen?

16:08.235 --> 16:11.504
The question is,
how bad will it be?

16:11.504 --> 16:13.406
That's terrible.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.042
Isn't there something
I can do?

16:15.042 --> 16:17.244
The sad truth is
that we've already put

16:17.244 --> 16:19.746
so much carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere

16:19.746 --> 16:21.914
that we're more
than halfway towards

16:21.914 --> 16:24.084
that two-degree
centigrade limit.

16:24.084 --> 16:27.320
And right now, companies
and countries already own

16:27.320 --> 16:28.755
enough fossil fuel
in reserves

16:28.755 --> 16:32.092
to meet that limit
five times over.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.063
Five times over?

16:36.063 --> 16:37.664
To keep it in the ground,

16:37.664 --> 16:39.899
they'd have to give up
trillions of dollars

16:39.899 --> 16:42.669
and we'd have to change
our entire way of life.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.837
And what happens
if we burn it?

16:44.837 --> 16:46.939
What happens
to our planet then?

16:46.939 --> 16:50.677
I don't know, but it won't be
our planet anymore.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.556
♪♪
(birds chirping)

17:07.094 --> 17:09.296
Oh, Sammy...

17:09.296 --> 17:11.064
everything I've done,

17:11.064 --> 17:15.635
all the green products I buy,
the trash I pick up...

17:15.635 --> 17:17.970
even the car I drive...

17:17.970 --> 17:20.607
it wasn't enough.

17:20.607 --> 17:25.312
I guess the only thing left
to do is... to prepare you

17:25.312 --> 17:29.149
for the post-apocalyptic
"Mad Max" future.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.650
Wayne, listen to me.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.419
The world is not ending.

17:32.419 --> 17:33.820
Despite everything,

17:33.820 --> 17:36.123
there are still tremendous
reasons for hope.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.657
Come on,
I'll show you!

17:37.657 --> 17:41.661
(engine revving effect,
tires screeching effect)

17:44.631 --> 17:45.998
Okay, buddy, spit it out.

17:45.998 --> 17:48.568
Can I stop the climate
apocalypse or not?

17:48.568 --> 17:50.069
By yourself, no.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.971
We have to do it together.

17:51.971 --> 17:54.974
Buying greener stuff
and walking to work is great,

17:54.974 --> 17:56.309
but it's not enough.

17:56.309 --> 17:59.779
The entire world has to come
together to solve this problem.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.013
That's never
gonna happen.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.915
Well, it already is.

18:02.915 --> 18:06.286
In 2015, nearly every country
in the world met as one

18:06.286 --> 18:08.421
and for the first time,
signed a treaty

18:08.421 --> 18:09.922
to curb carbon emissions.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.192
It was called
the Paris Agreement.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.627
You know, we could stop
Saran-wrapping

18:14.627 --> 18:16.163
our croissants
individually.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.331
That would be real nice
for New Orleans.

18:18.331 --> 18:21.134
And we could stop burning tires
just to pass a good time.

18:21.134 --> 18:22.602
Yeah.
(chuckles)

18:22.602 --> 18:24.204
New Orleans isn't
a country.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.206
Eh, my writing staff
loves Cajun jokes.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.040
What can I say?
Oh, hey, Dale.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.677
Each country agreed
to be accountable

18:30.677 --> 18:33.780
for reducing its emissions
every five years.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.482
That's a big deal.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.717
It proves that
international cooperation

18:37.717 --> 18:39.452
on climate change
is possible.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.021
That's amazing.
So the planet is saved?

18:42.021 --> 18:45.225
No, the Paris Agreement
is just a first step.

18:45.225 --> 18:48.161
Its emissions limits are
non-binding and by itself,

18:48.161 --> 18:50.963
it won't stop us from exceeding
two degrees of warming.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.665
(sighs)
So we are doomed.

18:52.665 --> 18:55.034
I feel like Miles Teller
I got so much whiplash.

18:55.034 --> 18:56.869
Wayne, you're missing
the point.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.538
This isn't pass/fail.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.540
This isn't about
saving the planet

19:00.540 --> 19:02.041
or destroying the earth.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.577
No matter how tough
things are now,

19:04.577 --> 19:06.579
we can always make things
better for Sammy

19:06.579 --> 19:08.415
and for the kids
that come later,

19:08.415 --> 19:11.218
and the Paris Agreement is
a big step on that road.

19:11.218 --> 19:14.086
Just... tell me
what I can do to help.

19:14.086 --> 19:16.423
Well, in addition
to reducing and reusing

19:16.423 --> 19:18.090
and all those good things,

19:18.090 --> 19:19.826
you have to take
individual action

19:19.826 --> 19:21.828
to encourage
collective responsibility.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.697
You can tell your politicians
to uphold the Paris Agreement

19:24.697 --> 19:26.199
and build on its success,

19:26.199 --> 19:27.834
and you can raise
your voice

19:27.834 --> 19:29.702
and encourage others
to do the same.

19:29.702 --> 19:32.872
And most importantly,
you can teach Sammy

19:32.872 --> 19:36.209
to take responsibility
and to continue the fight

19:36.209 --> 19:37.344
when she grows up.

19:37.344 --> 19:40.447
Humans have changed the earth
in profound ways,

19:40.447 --> 19:42.349
and we're gonna
keep changing it.

19:42.349 --> 19:45.184
But it's up to us what kind
of earth we're making.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.920
Thanks, Adam.

19:47.920 --> 19:52.058
That makes me feel,
well, kinda sad.

19:52.058 --> 19:53.793
But also kinda hopeful.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.195
Like a Demi Lovato song.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.197
Hmm, not familiar,
but I trust you.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.067
I should probably
get her to bed.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.769
Of course.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.612
Sammy...

20:12.612 --> 20:15.448
I know we messed up a bit.

20:15.448 --> 20:18.485
But we built all this.

20:18.485 --> 20:21.654
So that means we have
the power to change it.

20:21.654 --> 20:24.156
And I promise to do
everything I can

20:24.156 --> 20:25.958
to leave you a better world.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.140
Adam, tell us again

20:41.140 --> 20:43.476
about how we can't measure
our carbon footprints!

20:43.476 --> 20:45.645
No! I wanna hear about
how prescription drugs

20:45.645 --> 20:47.280
are the real epidemic!

20:47.280 --> 20:50.149
Guys, I already told you
all those things.

20:50.149 --> 20:51.984
No!
Again, again!

20:51.984 --> 20:53.353
We wanna hear 'em again!

20:53.353 --> 20:55.288
We love your facts,
they never get old.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.456
Yeah, Adam.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.325
You're just such
a fascinating guy.

20:58.325 --> 21:01.193
I feel truly lucky
to be your friend.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.866
I should go, right?

21:06.866 --> 21:08.167
Yeah.
