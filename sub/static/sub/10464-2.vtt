WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:04.137
I don't even know where
her parents live.

00:05.088 --> 00:06.232
It's a place back east, I think.

00:06.256 --> 00:07.233
Charlie...

00:07.257 --> 00:08.651
And I tried calling some
old friends of ours,

00:08.675 --> 00:09.976
but nobody kept in
touch with her.

00:10.885 --> 00:12.687
She just split.

00:12.887 --> 00:14.824
I know, we've been
over this but...

00:14.848 --> 00:16.075
It doesn't make any sense.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.284
She blows back into my life

00:17.308 --> 00:18.744
and asks me to help
take care of my kid.

00:18.768 --> 00:19.662
My kid.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.654
And then she takes off like
that doesn't even matter.

00:25.358 --> 00:26.585
She must have changed her mind.

00:26.609 --> 00:28.838
Well, that's not her right!
She can't do that.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.288
How can she just do that?

00:31.281 --> 00:32.842
I know I'm not the
greatest person

00:32.866 --> 00:34.125
to be saying this, but...

00:36.995 --> 00:38.296
If you think about it...

00:39.080 --> 00:40.506
I don't know, but...

00:41.041 --> 00:42.717
Maybe it's easier this way.

00:43.418 --> 00:44.886
Easier for who?

00:46.838 --> 00:48.014
Well...

00:48.339 --> 00:49.557
For you.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.559
For me?

00:52.010 --> 00:53.352
Are you kidding?

00:53.845 --> 00:55.938
Okay, for Spencer then.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.700
You said yourself,
you know, before,

00:57.724 --> 00:59.744
that it can't be in
his best interests

00:59.768 --> 01:01.120
to have someone come
in and out of his life

01:01.144 --> 01:02.121
all the time.

01:02.145 --> 01:04.364
It's got to be better than
growing up without a father.

01:04.438 --> 01:05.698
Maybe.

01:06.357 --> 01:07.835
But the more time
you spend with him,

01:07.859 --> 01:09.253
the more you're gonna
fall in love with him,

01:09.277 --> 01:11.204
and the more he'll
fall in love with you.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.790
Who's to say that she
wouldn't take off anyway?

01:17.327 --> 01:18.920
Kirsten, I worry about him.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.256
I know that sounds crazy, but...

01:22.999 --> 01:24.133
I do.

01:25.293 --> 01:26.803
Of course you do.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.473
But...

01:32.342 --> 01:33.778
By leaving like this,

01:33.802 --> 01:35.362
she's telling you

01:35.386 --> 01:38.231
that it's not your
responsibility anymore.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.983
She's letting you
off the hook and...

01:46.272 --> 01:47.907
Maybe that's for the best.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.537
So I'm supposed to just...

01:53.696 --> 01:55.081
forget about him?

01:58.910 --> 02:00.336
How can I do that?

02:04.207 --> 02:05.925
How can I possibly do that?

03:05.685 --> 03:07.204
Isn't she supposed to be dead?

03:07.228 --> 03:08.247
Mrs. Stickley?

03:08.271 --> 03:10.781
God, she'll be here when our
children are in high school.

03:12.901 --> 03:15.838
"Our" meaning "each
of us respectively."

03:15.862 --> 03:18.789
Shh. I'm trying to get
this stuff about college.

03:19.490 --> 03:20.833
You're taking notes?

03:21.701 --> 03:23.127
Look at this. He's taking notes.

03:23.161 --> 03:26.088
<i>We have a couple of
new rules this year.</i>

03:26.998 --> 03:28.642
<i>Students must...</i>

03:28.666 --> 03:29.977
Wait, wait. Go to the left.

03:30.001 --> 03:31.145
- Left?
- Mm-hm.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.470
No, your left.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.055
<i>And more importantly,</i>

03:34.464 --> 03:36.265
<i>self-control.</i>

03:36.966 --> 03:38.809
- There?
- There.

03:39.093 --> 03:43.147
<i>Therefore, there is to be no...</i>

03:44.015 --> 03:45.274
<i>touching,</i>

03:45.934 --> 03:48.871
<i>feeling, fondling</i>

03:48.895 --> 03:51.614
<i>or kissing on campus.</i>

03:52.148 --> 03:54.293
<i>Hand-holding and "hello,
goodbye" kisses</i>

03:54.317 --> 03:55.669
<i>will be acceptable</i>

03:55.693 --> 03:58.047
<i>at the discretion
of the faculty.</i>

03:58.071 --> 04:01.374
<i>Thank you all very much and
welcome back to school.</i>

04:06.537 --> 04:07.797
You want to let me in on this?

04:09.874 --> 04:11.551
My dad wants me to go to Perry.

04:12.627 --> 04:14.512
Perry? I can't get into Perry.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.846
You'll have to screw
up your application.

04:17.214 --> 04:20.351
Put down ax murderer as a
career goal or something.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.690
Or maybe for some strange reason
you actually want to do this.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.235
Well, I was thinking about it.

04:30.436 --> 04:31.654
I mean,

04:31.729 --> 04:33.489
I'm going out there,

04:33.606 --> 04:36.200
you know, to interview and
check out the campus.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.120
I'm sort of flying
out tonight and...

04:39.362 --> 04:40.621
Tonight?

04:41.239 --> 04:43.749
And what? You were just going
to let me think you'd vanished?

04:44.867 --> 04:46.294
Look, why don't
you come with me?

04:47.078 --> 04:49.682
Dad was going until he got a
more important call on line two

04:49.706 --> 04:51.684
so the ticket's paid for.

04:51.708 --> 04:52.851
It's only three days.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.812
What am I gonna do around
campus for three days

04:54.836 --> 04:56.804
while you're off playing Mr.
Ivy League?

04:56.921 --> 04:59.098
I don't know, Bay. What are you
gonna do hanging out here?

04:59.340 --> 05:02.018
Unless, of course, you're planning on
buckling down and hitting the books.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.105
Sullivan, Nancy. Large.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.149
Locker 37. Suit up.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.160
Salinger, Claudia.

05:10.184 --> 05:11.370
Size?

05:11.394 --> 05:14.030
Um, medium?

05:14.772 --> 05:16.032
How about extra small?

05:17.859 --> 05:21.672
Um, small's fine, I guess.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.998
- Locker 38. Suit up.
- Okay.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.000
Burgess, Kate.

05:26.242 --> 05:28.085
Ooh! Sorry. Sorry.

05:29.537 --> 05:30.755
What is it?

05:32.498 --> 05:34.216
It's on the bottom!

05:43.676 --> 05:44.935
Watch it!

05:52.894 --> 05:55.539
Ever notice how when somebody tells
you, you can't do something,

05:55.563 --> 05:57.323
it's all you can
think about doing?

06:00.234 --> 06:01.577
Only now,

06:01.694 --> 06:03.412
that's what I'm restricted to.

06:03.738 --> 06:06.175
A "hello, goodbye," might as
well be kissing my sister,

06:06.199 --> 06:08.459
no moving parts
allowed, kind of thing.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.679
I think that's up to the
discretion of the faculty.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.046
- Oh.
- Hm.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.672
When I really want to do this.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.807
Justin, maybe we shouldn't.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.318
You're right.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.769
Might lead to insanity
or something.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.315
Miss Salinger.

06:31.641 --> 06:32.858
Mr. Thompson.

06:34.310 --> 06:35.653
We were just

06:36.270 --> 06:37.613
saying goodbye.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.907
Well, say it again and
you're in detention.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.492
Oh, please.

06:41.859 --> 06:44.338
It's not like we were having
sex in the teachers lounge.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.956
It's school policy, Mr.
Thompson.

06:49.992 --> 06:51.053
Fine, then.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.879
Your choice. That's
detention for both of you.

06:59.001 --> 07:00.145
Okay.

07:00.169 --> 07:02.847
I got football,
basketball, baseball.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.975
That shows I'm pretty
well-rounded, right?

07:06.050 --> 07:08.320
Yeah. You'll be a regular
big man on campus.

07:08.344 --> 07:10.572
<i>...so we can get an
accurate head count.</i>

07:10.596 --> 07:11.949
Look, you want to come along

07:11.973 --> 07:15.369
just to make sure my guilt barometer
doesn't dip below red, fine.

07:15.393 --> 07:16.819
Go ahead. Heap it on.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.080
But you know what?

07:18.104 --> 07:19.415
I'm still glad you're doing this

07:19.439 --> 07:21.615
because I think it might
actually be good for you.

07:22.066 --> 07:23.335
You're right.

07:23.359 --> 07:24.837
I'll be able to picture
your surroundings

07:24.861 --> 07:26.922
while I send you hate mail
from Loser Community.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.549
Will you stop it
with that stuff?

07:28.573 --> 07:30.374
You're going to
college somewhere.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.094
And think about it.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.419
It's college, Bay.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.129
Women. Adventure.

07:35.705 --> 07:36.881
Ivy.

07:37.373 --> 07:39.059
I mean, it's like
a whole new life.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.352
Clean slate all the way.

07:40.376 --> 07:41.802
You can totally start over.

07:42.044 --> 07:43.814
Let's face it, Will.
I am who I am.

07:43.838 --> 07:44.982
Mr. Fordham?

07:45.006 --> 07:47.141
Thirty-two A and B? Mr. Fordham?

07:47.717 --> 07:49.027
No, no, there must be a...

07:49.051 --> 07:52.146
Please. Bill. Hi.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.824
I just wanted to let you know

07:53.848 --> 07:55.534
that we're just a
teensy bit overbooked

07:55.558 --> 07:56.743
in coach right now.

07:56.767 --> 07:57.703
So we're inviting

07:57.727 --> 08:00.196
some of our preferred flyers
to join us in first class.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.615
If that's all right
with you, of course.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.794
Uh, I guess we could
live with that.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.161
What do you think?

08:07.612 --> 08:10.090
Sure. Sure, happy to help out.

08:10.114 --> 08:12.041
- Then follow me.
- Great.

08:14.285 --> 08:15.512
Kirsten, can you
hand me that wrench?

08:15.536 --> 08:17.630
This other section's
gonna have to come off.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.725
It's clogged or something.
I don't know.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.050
Wow.

08:22.210 --> 08:25.095
Do I look kind of green to you?

08:25.671 --> 08:27.191
'Cause I'm kind of clammy

08:27.215 --> 08:30.893
and, and I think I'm
going to ralph.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.530
You don't feel warm.

08:34.554 --> 08:36.116
You want some ginger ale?

08:36.140 --> 08:38.275
That's okay. I just feel like...

08:38.851 --> 08:39.995
I don't know.

08:40.019 --> 08:43.457
Maybe just a 72-hour
bug or something.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.584
Charlie, before I forget,
will you sign this for me?

08:45.608 --> 08:48.160
A 72-hour bug, Claud?
What's going on?

08:48.319 --> 08:52.299
Nothing. Maybe I should
just go lie down.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.176
I just hate to have to miss
any school, that's all.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.554
Come on. Charlie Salinger on the
line "parent and/or guardian."

08:57.578 --> 08:59.014
Nice try. You're
going to school.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.016
Oh, man! Like that's fair?

09:01.040 --> 09:03.217
You let Bailey cut and
go look at that school.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.895
I didn't let Bailey do anything.

09:04.919 --> 09:05.979
Will you just sign this?

09:06.003 --> 09:07.263
I'm talking to Claudia.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.608
Detention?

09:09.632 --> 09:10.859
Don't pop an artery. It's just...

09:10.883 --> 09:11.944
What the hell you do, Jule?

09:11.968 --> 09:14.019
It's no big deal. Charlie,
what do you care?

09:16.180 --> 09:17.606
Fine.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.693
You're right. I don't care.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.162
Whatever you did, it's
none of my business.

09:22.186 --> 09:23.580
You know what Claud, you
want to skip school,

09:23.604 --> 09:25.207
go right ahead, you
and Bailey both.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.907
I'll write you notes
until you're 30.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.784
Just do whatever
the hell you want.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.502
Hey, know what?

09:39.161 --> 09:40.138
Let's get out of here

09:40.162 --> 09:41.755
and go listen to some
music or something.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.009
Come on. It'll be fun.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.139
I used to babysit
for those guys.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.779
And they thought 'cause I was
just their stupid brother,

09:55.803 --> 09:57.197
they could do
whatever they wanted.

09:57.221 --> 09:58.480
I mean...

09:59.307 --> 10:00.450
I'd try to get them to go to bed

10:00.474 --> 10:04.111
or not watch an R-rated
movie on cable,

10:04.854 --> 10:06.447
and they'd be like, you know,

10:06.772 --> 10:08.407
"You're not the boss of me."

10:10.610 --> 10:12.129
The only way I could
keep them in line

10:12.153 --> 10:14.413
was to threaten them, you know?

10:14.697 --> 10:16.540
"Wait till Mom and
Dad get home."

10:19.201 --> 10:22.630
Only now, I'm 25 years old, and
I'm trying to be a father.

10:24.248 --> 10:27.259
I really am and, you know...

10:27.543 --> 10:29.929
Hey, I'm just the babysitter.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.775
That's all I'm ever going to be.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.235
That's not true, Charlie.

10:35.259 --> 10:36.477
Yes, it is.

10:41.223 --> 10:45.861
Except there's this
kid out there.

10:47.438 --> 10:50.699
My kid. My son.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.164
I'm his father, Kirsten.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.511
And he might actually,
you know, look up to me

11:01.535 --> 11:04.838
and listen to me and love me.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.550
And that'd just be...

11:14.799 --> 11:16.183
I have to find him.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.690
I have to find him, and
I have to be his dad.

11:24.141 --> 11:25.359
I just do.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.383
Okay. Is everybody
here for the tour?

11:39.407 --> 11:40.708
That's us!

11:40.741 --> 11:41.843
Will McCorkle.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.335
Great. I'm Keri.

11:44.453 --> 11:45.514
What's your name?

11:45.538 --> 11:48.382
Oh, uh, I'm just Bailey...

11:48.874 --> 11:50.217
Salinger.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.812
What, should I call you "just"

11:51.836 --> 11:53.679
or maybe J.B.?

11:55.589 --> 11:58.851
Uh, Bailey's fine, actually.

12:00.302 --> 12:01.571
So, uh, Bay,

12:01.595 --> 12:03.073
you wanna meet back at the room?

12:03.097 --> 12:05.441
We should probably get
started on the tour.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.151
I can't wait to get a
look at this place.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.111
Let's do it.

12:09.311 --> 12:11.405
Let's. Definitely.

12:12.565 --> 12:13.583
Okay.

12:13.607 --> 12:16.785
So, um, Will McCorkle?

12:17.528 --> 12:18.829
Great.

12:19.029 --> 12:20.914
- Mark Knowles?
- Yes, that's me.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.541
And, um...

12:23.075 --> 12:25.836
That's funny. You said Salinger?

12:25.995 --> 12:29.131
Yeah. Um, but I'm probably
in with the transfers.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.642
See, Will and I,

12:30.666 --> 12:32.018
we're old friends
from San Francisco,

12:32.042 --> 12:33.311
and he wrote me to tell me

12:33.335 --> 12:35.063
that he was coming out
to look at Perry,

12:35.087 --> 12:38.640
and I'm thinking of
transferring from state.

12:38.924 --> 12:39.985
Oh.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.352
Yeah, well, I've heard all
about you state guys.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.148
Well, I'm an exception.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.369
Why don't we all head
over to north campus

12:49.393 --> 12:51.945
and get the dull stuff
out of the way first?

12:52.229 --> 12:54.490
Great. I have got a
ton of questions.

12:55.691 --> 12:57.326
So, Keri, what do you study?

12:57.485 --> 12:58.744
Premed.

12:59.069 --> 13:00.255
Puke, right?

13:00.279 --> 13:01.497
Oh, I don't know.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.499
Kind of been noodling
that myself.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.127
So where did you say
we're going first?

13:08.245 --> 13:11.507
No, you don't understand. I've been to
every university and art school in town.

13:11.999 --> 13:12.976
I told you.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.436
If you knew how many
guys come in here

13:14.460 --> 13:15.854
asking for the numbers of women

13:15.878 --> 13:16.897
they've seen naked...

13:16.921 --> 13:17.939
This isn't about that.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.723
Just look and tell me
if she models here.

13:21.258 --> 13:22.684
I think you should go.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.146
Hey!

13:27.473 --> 13:28.982
Do you want me to
call the police?

13:32.186 --> 13:33.445
Look,

13:35.814 --> 13:37.741
she took off with my son, okay?

13:38.567 --> 13:40.327
My three-year-old son.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.757
And I didn't even know I had
a son until a few days ago,

13:43.781 --> 13:47.125
and this whole thing is
just driving me crazy.

13:48.827 --> 13:51.964
You have to help me, and I am not
going to leave here until you do.

13:56.043 --> 13:57.395
What was the name again?

13:57.419 --> 13:59.471
Pamela. Pamela Rush.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.308
Hmm.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.186
She called in yesterday
looking for work.

14:12.142 --> 14:13.402
Finally.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.363
The Incredibra.
Yes, that's right.

14:17.606 --> 14:19.324
Just how incredible is that?

14:20.568 --> 14:22.128
Oh. Well, never mind.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.579
Well, what about the junior?

14:24.780 --> 14:26.039
Uh, size?

14:27.074 --> 14:28.292
Wow!

14:30.911 --> 14:32.212
I don't know.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.505
Um...

14:33.831 --> 14:36.258
well, actually,
actually it's a gift.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.602
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:37.626 --> 14:40.313
It's a gift for
my little sister.

14:40.337 --> 14:43.608
Yeah, well, she's 14 and...

14:43.632 --> 14:44.693
Oh, no, no, no.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.060
She definitely needs more
than a training bra.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.855
Well, you know, something
with a little room in it.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.065
No, not a C cup.

14:52.266 --> 14:55.736
Well, more like, more like an A.

14:57.938 --> 14:59.573
Or maybe A minus?

15:00.149 --> 15:01.450
<i>Hello, hey!</i>

15:01.984 --> 15:03.327
<i>The Big Kiss-Off</i>

15:03.360 --> 15:05.370
<i>tomorrow after sixth period.</i>

15:05.571 --> 15:07.247
<i>Lips unite for civil rights.</i>

15:12.244 --> 15:13.388
Justin, do you really think

15:13.412 --> 15:14.973
anyone's actually
going to do this?

15:14.997 --> 15:17.893
Yeah. Civil disobedience. Sex.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.311
It's not like we're asking them

15:19.335 --> 15:21.637
to pick up a gun and run at
the White House or anything.

15:32.848 --> 15:33.950
Hey, there's Griffin.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.077
Could use people who aren't
scared of detention.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.078
Justin...

15:37.102 --> 15:38.403
Hey, Griffin.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.249
- Hey.
- Oh, you got one.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.491
So are you gonna come?

15:45.444 --> 15:46.745
Are these your lips?

15:47.446 --> 15:49.957
Oh, um, Sheryl Crow's, actually.

15:50.741 --> 15:52.376
We could really use your help.

15:53.077 --> 15:54.753
You got somebody for me to kiss?

15:56.580 --> 15:58.382
Well, what about your, uh...

15:59.375 --> 16:00.676
Erica?

16:02.544 --> 16:03.772
Uh, uh...

16:03.796 --> 16:06.181
That's not happening.
That's history.

16:07.508 --> 16:08.767
Thanks, anyway.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.368
So are you in a sorority?

16:27.736 --> 16:31.091
No. It's, it's totally
not my scene.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.291
Hmm.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.011
I like to keep my personal
time, you know, open.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.211
Really?

16:36.286 --> 16:37.504
Me too.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.265
I got better things to do

16:39.289 --> 16:41.300
than spend all my time with
a bunch of other guys.

16:41.583 --> 16:42.843
Yeah.

16:43.877 --> 16:45.262
Probably like...

16:46.255 --> 16:48.473
spending time with your
girlfriend, right?

16:53.345 --> 16:54.563
I'm sorry.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.450
Sensitive subject?

16:57.474 --> 16:58.692
No.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.444
Uh, no.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.529
No.

17:03.063 --> 17:07.242
I don't actually
have a girlfriend.

17:09.528 --> 17:10.829
Was it a messy breakup?

17:11.864 --> 17:12.924
No.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.624
No, no. It was... It's...

17:14.867 --> 17:16.417
No, it was nothing like that.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.087
The truth is...

17:23.459 --> 17:26.636
I guess I've never
really been in love.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.306
Get out of here.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.516
- You?
- Yeah.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.154
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't know.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.520
I guess...

17:36.221 --> 17:37.647
Guess I've never really...

17:39.600 --> 17:42.611
met the right girl, actually.

17:45.272 --> 17:46.448
Oh.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.602
Charlie! What are
you doing here?

18:16.386 --> 18:17.729
I want an explanation.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.440
Sorry, guys. Let's take a break.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.235
Could you hand me my robe?

18:23.811 --> 18:25.237
Were you gonna call me?

18:26.396 --> 18:28.698
Write me a letter? Tell me where
to send the checks? What?

18:29.274 --> 18:30.752
Actually, no, I wasn't. I, uh...

18:30.776 --> 18:32.003
I mean, you come to me for help,

18:32.027 --> 18:33.338
and when I say I'll
give it to you...

18:33.362 --> 18:34.579
I know.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.748
I know.

18:37.783 --> 18:41.930
I guess what you wanted to give
was more than I wanted from you.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.255
What you wanted?

18:43.914 --> 18:45.382
What about Spencer?

18:46.083 --> 18:47.227
- Charlie...
- What? What?

18:47.251 --> 18:49.719
You just decided for yourself that I
wouldn't be a good enough father?

18:49.753 --> 18:51.106
You think I'm so terrible

18:51.130 --> 18:52.982
that you don't want me to be a
part of his life? Is that it?

18:53.006 --> 18:54.516
You don't know me at all, Pam.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.477
A lot can happen in four years.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.231
I mean, God, he's my son.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.322
No, he isn't, Charlie.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.373
Why are you doing this?
Why are you lying to me?

19:20.200 --> 19:21.918
I'm not lying to you, Charlie.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.965
The truth is,

19:27.040 --> 19:31.386
Spence was born 11 months
after you and I split up.

19:34.464 --> 19:38.935
And I lied about the dates so you'd
think he was yours because...

19:43.265 --> 19:45.650
Because I remember what
you used to be like.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.904
And I thought...

19:50.647 --> 19:53.742
I thought if I told
you he was yours,

19:53.859 --> 19:55.837
you would just
give me some money

19:55.861 --> 19:57.537
and send me on my way.

19:58.864 --> 20:02.083
And I didn't know
what else to do.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.339
Money's really tight.

20:11.168 --> 20:14.179
My mother doesn't think
that I'm providing for him.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.902
And I think that she's
even talked to a lawyer

20:18.926 --> 20:21.478
because she wants to
take him away from me.

20:23.597 --> 20:25.482
And he's all I've got.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.696
But that's not your problem

20:34.524 --> 20:36.409
because he's not
your son, Charlie.

20:39.696 --> 20:41.039
He's not.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.044
And I'm sorry.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.048
I'm so...

20:52.417 --> 20:53.677
sorry.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.285
I mean, how hard is it to
shave two months off his age?

21:09.309 --> 21:10.652
That's an easy lie.

21:10.811 --> 21:12.455
But why? Why would she do that?

21:12.479 --> 21:14.207
Maybe she thinks I'm still
the way I used to be.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.824
Maybe she can't get past that.

21:15.857 --> 21:17.200
I don't know, Charlie.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.837
I mean, yes, it was a
terrible thing to do to you.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.288
Horrible. But...

21:21.405 --> 21:22.998
There's got to be
more to it than that.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.625
You know, I played with this kid.
I saw him.

21:25.784 --> 21:28.587
And this may sound crazy,
but I felt a connection.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.265
Claud, you about done in there?

21:30.289 --> 21:31.631
Almost!

21:33.250 --> 21:34.811
And I can't just take
her word for this.

21:34.835 --> 21:37.137
If I do, I'll be wondering about
it for the rest of my life.

21:37.671 --> 21:38.648
Claudia!

21:38.672 --> 21:40.223
Hold on! Just a second.

21:42.509 --> 21:43.727
What?

21:44.261 --> 21:45.154
Nothing.

21:45.178 --> 21:46.688
I was just wondering
about today.

21:47.514 --> 21:49.482
How we're supposed to get
our marriage license

21:49.850 --> 21:51.744
and that maybe we
should just put it off

21:51.768 --> 21:53.528
until you have time
to deal with this.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.447
No. No, we should go.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.084
- Are you sure? Because...
- I'm positive. I want to.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.534
Is Claud still in there?

22:01.361 --> 22:03.006
Claudia? Come on.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.497
In a minute.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.168
Oh, it's okay. I'll
go downstairs.

22:17.252 --> 22:20.889
Sorry. I was, um, flossing.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.619
Will, we really
don't have to run.

22:33.643 --> 22:35.496
I just wanted to get there
a few minutes early

22:35.520 --> 22:37.572
so I won't be all sweaty
for my interview.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.208
I'm sorry I was late.

22:39.232 --> 22:42.369
It's just, we sort of
lost track of time.

22:43.070 --> 22:45.872
"We"? As in you and Bailey?

22:46.406 --> 22:47.582
Yeah.

22:49.076 --> 22:50.428
We met for breakfast

22:50.452 --> 22:53.588
and then we just spent hours
at the student museum.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.840
Really? How was that?

22:56.458 --> 22:57.884
He is so great.

22:58.585 --> 23:01.137
He mentioned he's really
into postmodernism, and...

23:01.213 --> 23:02.148
Can you believe it?

23:02.172 --> 23:04.317
There just happens to be
this exhibit here on campus.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.235
So I just had to show him.

23:06.259 --> 23:09.822
Well, I guess he gets the whole
culture thing from his parents.

23:09.846 --> 23:11.314
Yeah, that's what he said.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.734
God, the way he talks about
them, they sound so great.

23:14.768 --> 23:17.028
Yeah. They really were.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.407
Were?

23:24.945 --> 23:27.497
Well, I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.458
You know, about you and Erica.

23:31.284 --> 23:32.710
Yeah, why?

23:33.954 --> 23:35.547
Well, I just am.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.142
I mean, I know it's hard when
you break up with someone,

23:38.166 --> 23:41.020
and since you're my, um, friend,

23:41.044 --> 23:43.805
I just hate to see you go
through that, you know?

23:45.340 --> 23:48.059
But if you don't wanna
talk about it, it's okay.

23:49.010 --> 23:50.311
What's to talk about?

23:52.556 --> 23:55.868
Oh, so you broke up with her
and not the other way around?

23:55.892 --> 23:57.110
I mean...

23:59.354 --> 24:01.823
It just sort of
happened, you know?

24:02.482 --> 24:04.451
She's just always talking

24:05.402 --> 24:06.995
about nothing, you know?

24:10.157 --> 24:11.374
Yeah.

24:16.246 --> 24:19.048
Well, I'll see you around.

24:20.750 --> 24:21.968
Oh, yeah!

24:22.460 --> 24:26.181
Uh, good luck with
that kissing thing.

25:14.804 --> 25:16.731
You were right.

25:18.099 --> 25:19.359
I'm off the hook.

25:24.272 --> 25:25.532
Put them right up here.

25:26.399 --> 25:28.085
Hey, Sarah. Are you
going to join us?

25:28.109 --> 25:31.005
Well, not technically, no.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.298
For obvious reasons.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.091
I just came to show my support.

25:34.115 --> 25:36.167
I've never really been
part of a protest before.

25:37.118 --> 25:38.679
It's kind of invigorating.

25:38.703 --> 25:39.722
Great.

25:39.746 --> 25:42.840
Well, uh, if you wanna
be point person,

25:42.874 --> 25:44.227
keep an eye out for
Miss Stickley.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.311
She's coming from the lounge.

25:45.335 --> 25:46.511
Got it.

25:48.838 --> 25:50.691
Hey, give me something
good for the front page.

25:50.715 --> 25:51.776
Front page?

25:51.800 --> 25:52.902
Of the school paper.

25:52.926 --> 25:54.403
You guys are the
official poster kids

25:54.427 --> 25:56.229
for the kissing cause, so...

25:56.721 --> 25:57.615
So kiss.

25:57.639 --> 26:00.233
Ooh! Ooh, ooh! Vice
squad at nine o'clock!

26:00.267 --> 26:01.577
Perfect. Give us a big one!

26:01.601 --> 26:03.329
Okay. Okay, everybody,
this is it.

26:03.353 --> 26:06.155
So, uh, so, uh, go for it.

26:07.774 --> 26:08.834
Justin...

26:08.858 --> 26:10.753
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, just...

26:10.777 --> 26:12.537
Well, this really feels stupid.

26:12.612 --> 26:14.215
- That's the whole point.
- Well, I know.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.207
But maybe we're making too
bigger deal out of this.

26:16.324 --> 26:17.969
We're making a statement here.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.003
Well, maybe we should
make a statement about...

26:20.036 --> 26:22.306
I don't know, saving the
rainforest or the ozone layer

26:22.330 --> 26:24.183
or something that
actually matters.

26:24.207 --> 26:25.717
Mr. Thompson?

26:27.669 --> 26:29.721
What's all this, Mr. Thompson?

26:31.840 --> 26:33.308
The Big Kiss-Off.

26:34.342 --> 26:35.560
Apparently.

26:38.388 --> 26:40.992
Hey, Jul, did you get that
message on the machine

26:41.016 --> 26:42.817
from the guy with
the school paper?

26:42.976 --> 26:43.995
'Cause he called again.

26:44.019 --> 26:47.415
He said that he wants a
comment and... Hello?

26:47.439 --> 26:49.417
- What do you think you're doing?
- Asking you if...

26:49.441 --> 26:51.284
Go take those off.
God, you look stupid.

26:51.776 --> 26:53.754
Boy, forget you.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.298
Like it's any of your
business anyway.

26:55.322 --> 26:57.415
It's ridiculous. I mean,
why are you doing this?

26:58.283 --> 26:59.677
Oh, you'd really understand.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.544
It's not like you ever
had this problem.

27:02.495 --> 27:04.005
Trust me, Claud, okay,

27:04.289 --> 27:07.425
you're so much better off staying
12 until you're like 80.

27:07.751 --> 27:08.853
It's a whole lot simpler.

27:08.877 --> 27:10.104
I bet you didn't feel that way

27:10.128 --> 27:11.888
when you were
starting junior high.

27:12.380 --> 27:16.434
I mean, I thought it was gonna
be like this really big deal,

27:16.593 --> 27:18.029
and everything was
gonna be different,

27:18.053 --> 27:20.104
and I was gonna be all
grown up or something.

27:20.638 --> 27:23.034
And then I go there, and
it's not any different,

27:23.058 --> 27:25.202
and it's not any better, and
I don't know what to do

27:25.226 --> 27:26.912
because I'm exactly the same,

27:26.936 --> 27:31.407
only now I'm taking gym with a bunch
of Amazons with D cups, and I just...

27:32.734 --> 27:36.079
Well, I wanna look
like everybody else.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.751
So I was thinking that maybe I
could come back in a few weeks.

27:41.826 --> 27:44.055
And if I make early acceptance,

27:44.079 --> 27:45.838
I'm gonna be starting
spring semester.

27:46.247 --> 27:47.757
So that'd be pretty cool, right?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.301
Yeah, Bailey, that
would be great.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.931
Well, I'm... I'm babbling here.

27:55.048 --> 27:56.525
I do that sometimes
when I'm nervous,

27:56.549 --> 27:58.226
just babble.

28:02.806 --> 28:05.159
So you wanna, uh,
get out of here?

28:05.183 --> 28:07.620
You wanna go grab
something to eat

28:07.644 --> 28:09.028
or see a movie?

28:10.897 --> 28:12.031
Or...

28:12.357 --> 28:13.825
Or just do this.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.618
This is nice.

28:18.113 --> 28:19.831
Hey, I'm coming back, you know.

28:23.451 --> 28:24.585
Bailey,

28:25.328 --> 28:26.671
not now.

28:28.373 --> 28:29.716
Okay.

28:32.877 --> 28:34.303
Why not?

28:36.172 --> 28:38.442
God, it's like, intellectually,

28:38.466 --> 28:41.570
I have every right to
be angry with you,

28:41.594 --> 28:44.856
but when I think about
everything you've been through,

28:44.931 --> 28:46.190
I just...

28:47.308 --> 28:49.027
I understand, you know?

28:57.026 --> 28:58.202
Oh.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.544
I'm so sorry, Bailey.

29:09.456 --> 29:11.674
I wasn't going to say
anything, but...

29:13.126 --> 29:15.720
I can't imagine how hard
it must have been for you.

29:16.254 --> 29:17.722
- And...
- Will told you.

29:21.259 --> 29:24.020
About your girlfriend.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.316
And about your parents.

29:36.191 --> 29:37.992
Look, thanks. It's been a blast.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.714
Bailey, wait. I
want you to stay.

29:41.738 --> 29:43.039
Why?

29:43.364 --> 29:45.750
Why? So you can look at
me like that all night?

29:46.701 --> 29:49.096
No, I just thought maybe
you'd wanna talk about it.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.673
No, see, that's just it, Keri.
I don't wanna talk about it.

29:53.541 --> 29:57.261
I'm handling this, you know?
I'm... I'm figuring it out.

29:57.962 --> 29:59.315
And people looking at me

29:59.339 --> 30:01.901
and asking me if I'm okay all the
time, that doesn't help at all.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.518
That just makes
everything worse.

30:04.844 --> 30:08.064
I just wanted to get
away from that for once.

30:11.017 --> 30:12.985
For once. And now I can't.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.823
I'm sorry.

30:27.283 --> 30:28.668
Bed's kinda empty.

30:32.580 --> 30:33.881
What are you doing?

30:37.252 --> 30:39.387
Ed McMahon addressed to you.

30:41.005 --> 30:42.640
Probably should toss it.

30:42.924 --> 30:44.684
'Cause it'll just lay around.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.603
You'll think about sending
it in, but you won't.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.241
And then it'll still be here.

30:50.265 --> 30:53.776
It's only gonna irritate me, so I
should probably just throw it out.

30:57.063 --> 30:58.656
You do that, you know?

31:01.943 --> 31:03.744
It's four o'clock
in the morning.

31:04.696 --> 31:08.133
I mean, I kinda like things to
be in their place, you know?

31:08.157 --> 31:12.587
Like, bills sorted,
junk mail tossed out.

31:14.664 --> 31:17.049
But you're happy with
all these little...

31:18.084 --> 31:21.095
piles of stickies with
your handwriting on them.

31:22.380 --> 31:25.141
All these little Charlie nests

31:26.509 --> 31:29.270
that end up laying around
wherever they end up.

31:33.433 --> 31:35.484
And I guess it's
okay, because...

31:35.768 --> 31:37.528
I mean, I'm in love with you,

31:38.479 --> 31:40.823
and I'm the one with the
issue, so I don't mind.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.285
But I'm wondering,

31:45.028 --> 31:47.580
am I still gonna feel
this way in five years?

31:47.780 --> 31:49.123
Or 25?

31:49.532 --> 31:52.793
Is it gonna be endearing or
is it gonna make me crazy?

31:54.954 --> 31:56.797
What are you talking about?

32:01.628 --> 32:02.970
I'm scared.

32:05.632 --> 32:07.943
Because I leave junk
mail on the counter?

32:07.967 --> 32:09.227
No.

32:10.553 --> 32:12.156
Because I know you're
in love with me,

32:12.180 --> 32:14.565
and you're willing to
overlook things right now.

32:16.726 --> 32:18.110
But I have this...

32:20.313 --> 32:22.082
little problem, Charlie.

32:22.106 --> 32:23.824
I can't have children.

32:26.194 --> 32:29.956
And I know that you say
you're okay with that now,

32:30.281 --> 32:31.874
but I've been here.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.543
I've watched you go
through this whole thing.

32:35.286 --> 32:37.806
And I'm scared because I
saw the look on your face

32:37.830 --> 32:40.466
when you found out Spencer
wasn't really yours.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.763
And I saw how much
he mattered to you.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.525
Your heart is broken
over something

32:48.549 --> 32:50.685
that I can never, ever give you.

32:52.637 --> 32:55.407
And I don't want you to say
that you're okay with this now

32:55.431 --> 32:57.117
because you might wake
up in a few years

32:57.141 --> 32:58.943
and realize that you're not.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.414
I won't do that.

33:02.438 --> 33:04.073
You might, Charlie.

33:06.067 --> 33:08.420
We're looking at an
entire lifetime together

33:08.444 --> 33:10.454
with no children of our own.

33:12.824 --> 33:16.428
And I can live with all these
little piles of paper.

33:16.452 --> 33:17.878
I can.

33:19.747 --> 33:22.717
But can you honestly tell me
that you're okay with that?

33:26.421 --> 33:27.763
Can you?

33:46.024 --> 33:47.325
There you go.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.953
Will you at least cough so I know
you haven't lapsed into a coma?

33:51.112 --> 33:52.330
I'm trying to watch.

33:53.072 --> 33:54.498
It's <i>Free Willy,</i> Bay.

33:54.657 --> 33:56.500
It has a happy ending.
You'll hate it.

33:56.617 --> 33:59.170
- And for you?
- I'll have a Scotch.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.548
Got milk?

34:03.332 --> 34:05.343
I'm trying to apologize here.

34:05.501 --> 34:07.229
Okay? I didn't mean to tell her.

34:07.253 --> 34:09.273
It just sorta slipped out.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.315
Yeah.

34:10.339 --> 34:11.817
Juicy gossip, I bet.

34:11.841 --> 34:13.059
What?

34:13.092 --> 34:14.935
No. It wasn't like that.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.155
And I stood by you

34:16.179 --> 34:17.656
on the whole transfer-from-state thing.
I swear.

34:17.679 --> 34:19.440
That's just great, Will.

34:19.556 --> 34:20.743
How's that make me feel,

34:20.766 --> 34:22.578
you guys talking about
me behind my back?

34:22.601 --> 34:25.330
We were talking about how glad
I was to see you having fun.

34:25.353 --> 34:26.781
Yeah. You know what? I was.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.710
I was, because for once
in, like, forever,

34:29.734 --> 34:32.295
no one was whispering
or feeling sorry for me

34:32.320 --> 34:33.422
or saying, "Oh, poor Bailey."

34:33.446 --> 34:35.373
I didn't have any of that
crap following me around.

34:36.616 --> 34:37.917
I was just...

34:38.951 --> 34:40.585
I was just this guy.

34:41.204 --> 34:43.139
You know, why shouldn't I
be allowed to do that?

34:43.164 --> 34:44.266
No one says you shouldn't.

34:44.290 --> 34:46.257
Everybody does, Will. You did.

34:47.293 --> 34:50.054
And that is just it. Unless
I am 3000 miles away,

34:50.088 --> 34:52.014
surrounded by people who
don't even know me...

34:57.053 --> 34:58.697
You said college
was a clean slate.

34:58.721 --> 35:00.689
Well, that is what I
need, completely clean.

35:00.807 --> 35:03.442
And I'm entitled to that, Will.
I'm entitled to at least that.

35:16.656 --> 35:17.957
Justin.

35:18.407 --> 35:19.583
Julia.

35:20.618 --> 35:22.837
I have a rather difficult
admission to make.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.090
Well, Miss Stickley,

35:26.624 --> 35:28.134
you're among friends.

35:28.167 --> 35:29.885
You're both very good students.

35:30.503 --> 35:32.471
Top five percent of your class.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.234
And I guess what
you've made me realize

35:35.258 --> 35:37.277
is that my first responsibility

35:37.301 --> 35:40.020
is as an educator,
not a chaperon.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.616
You mean you're lifting the ban?

35:42.640 --> 35:44.066
I'm amending it.

35:45.351 --> 35:47.621
The fact is, I do
have recollections

35:47.645 --> 35:49.822
of being your age and,

35:50.148 --> 35:51.333
in love.

35:51.357 --> 35:53.460
And when I see the
two of you together,

35:53.484 --> 35:55.536
I'm reminded of that, so...

35:56.988 --> 36:01.459
I think you'll find the
terms much less severe.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.383
So basically, no petting?

36:10.585 --> 36:12.136
Basically, yes.

36:15.214 --> 36:18.434
Well, I think we could
probably live with that.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.604
Don't you, Jule?

36:22.388 --> 36:23.772
Mm. Sure.

36:24.640 --> 36:25.941
Why not?

36:27.435 --> 36:28.736
Hi.

36:29.604 --> 36:31.197
I'm Donald Grosse.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.792
I know it's an unfortunate name,

36:33.816 --> 36:36.869
but in the original German
it actually means great.

36:37.403 --> 36:39.548
So, uh, you're Claudia, right?

36:39.572 --> 36:42.708
Uh, yeah.

36:43.242 --> 36:45.211
It's the feminine
form of Claude,

36:45.786 --> 36:47.755
which is Latin meaning lame.

36:48.414 --> 36:50.142
Not that you're
lame or anything.

36:50.166 --> 36:52.144
Of course, obviously not.

36:52.168 --> 36:55.846
Obviously, you're
very, very mature.

36:57.381 --> 36:58.599
Sorry.

36:58.799 --> 36:59.860
I gotta go.

36:59.884 --> 37:01.644
Mind if I walk with you?

37:01.969 --> 37:03.312
I'm, uh...

37:03.804 --> 37:07.149
I'm going to the bathroom,
the girls' bathroom.

37:07.558 --> 37:09.109
I'll wait for you.

37:20.279 --> 37:22.706
Hey. What happened?

37:23.574 --> 37:24.875
Oh. You're back.

37:26.035 --> 37:27.095
I'm back.

37:27.119 --> 37:28.712
You didn't tell me
you were going.

37:28.871 --> 37:30.589
It was kind of a spur
of the moment thing.

37:30.790 --> 37:31.767
No kidding.

37:31.791 --> 37:33.101
I mean, I looked
for you at lunch,

37:33.125 --> 37:34.978
and then, when I didn't see
you in the study hall,

37:35.002 --> 37:36.647
I called your house
and Claudia told me.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.389
Are you keeping tabs on me?

37:38.506 --> 37:41.944
No, no, I just didn't know if
you were sick or something

37:41.968 --> 37:43.987
and maybe needed to
borrow my Lit notes.

37:44.011 --> 37:45.155
That's all.

37:45.179 --> 37:47.690
But then, when I read
your horoscope, I...

37:47.723 --> 37:49.191
You read my horoscope?

37:49.475 --> 37:50.827
Well, yeah.

37:50.851 --> 37:53.247
I mean, it's not like I sat and
drew up your charts or anything.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.250
- I just read it in the paper.
- Hm.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.669
Anyway, it said something
about adventure

37:58.693 --> 38:00.462
and a legal issue
resolved in your favor,

38:00.486 --> 38:02.830
so I figured you were okay.

38:03.364 --> 38:04.748
Yeah. I'm okay.

38:05.491 --> 38:08.085
And you're back.

38:08.577 --> 38:09.837
I'm back.

38:16.836 --> 38:20.023
I know what my transcript says.
I know it's on my record.

38:20.047 --> 38:21.525
And I know that I'm
a prime candidate

38:21.549 --> 38:24.695
for San Francisco State or Oakland
Community or someplace like that.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.488
But I have got a whole
year ahead of me.

38:26.512 --> 38:28.439
And I hope you don't
laugh when I say this,

38:28.681 --> 38:30.899
but I don't want to go
to any of those places.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.287
And what I need from you
right now is a plan.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.956
You just tell me exactly
what I have to do this year

38:35.980 --> 38:37.656
and I will do it,
whatever it takes.

38:39.817 --> 38:41.169
Just as long as it means

38:41.193 --> 38:43.454
that I can get as far away
from here as possible.

38:45.531 --> 38:46.707
Damn it.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.335
Go ahead, huh?

38:49.744 --> 38:52.713
Ask me why I'm here instead
of out shopping with Kirsten.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.548
I'm kind of busy, Claud.

38:54.582 --> 38:56.143
Well, it's because
we were in Macy's,

38:56.167 --> 38:58.729
and, well, she just, She
just started crying,

38:58.753 --> 39:00.689
and she couldn't stop, so
it seemed kind of stupid

39:00.713 --> 39:02.556
to go try on
bridesmaid's dresses.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.225
I'll go talk to her.

39:05.551 --> 39:06.935
She isn't here.

39:07.303 --> 39:08.280
She dropped me off.

39:08.304 --> 39:11.148
She said that, that she
needed some time to herself.

39:12.391 --> 39:14.276
She's really sad, Charlie.

39:14.393 --> 39:16.580
I mean, she's sad,
and she's crying,

39:16.604 --> 39:18.081
and it's all your fault.

39:18.105 --> 39:19.698
This really doesn't
concern you, Claud.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.534
Yes, it does.

39:22.693 --> 39:24.870
Because I'm scared that you
guys are gonna break up.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.631
I mean, is that what
you're gonna do?

39:26.655 --> 39:28.091
And, and then, I just,
I don't get it,

39:28.115 --> 39:30.250
because I've seen your other
girlfriends, Charlie.

39:30.284 --> 39:31.678
And Kirsten is so great.

39:31.702 --> 39:34.264
She's just, she's just so great,

39:34.288 --> 39:37.225
and I just, I'm so scared that
you're not gonna marry her

39:37.249 --> 39:39.009
just because she
can't have kids.

39:41.379 --> 39:42.554
She told you?

39:42.922 --> 39:44.890
I sleep in the dining
room, Charlie.

39:45.549 --> 39:46.860
I heard you guys fighting, but...

39:46.884 --> 39:48.820
- We weren't fighting.
- And now it's like,

39:48.844 --> 39:51.239
I can't believe you would just
dump her because of that.

39:51.263 --> 39:52.616
And then, and then...

39:52.640 --> 39:54.743
You think you're gonna find
someone who can have kids,

39:54.767 --> 39:55.827
but what if you don't?

39:55.851 --> 39:58.455
Then you're not gonna have kids,
you're not gonna have Kirsten,

39:58.479 --> 40:00.155
and that would be pretty stupid.

40:00.398 --> 40:03.117
That would be the stupidest
thing you ever did.

40:04.318 --> 40:05.619
It's just...

40:06.404 --> 40:07.672
kinda complicated.

40:07.696 --> 40:09.540
No, it isn't, Charlie.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.501
It's so simple.

40:29.677 --> 40:30.811
Oh, hi.

40:31.470 --> 40:32.813
What are you doing?

40:33.556 --> 40:35.700
Um, well, Mrs. Stickley

40:35.724 --> 40:37.568
couldn't let us off
the hook completely.

40:38.644 --> 40:39.862
Pretty lame, huh?

40:40.729 --> 40:41.905
Looks like it.

40:46.819 --> 40:48.996
So, uh, congratulations,

40:50.364 --> 40:53.834
on, uh, making it legal
to kiss somebody again.

41:30.321 --> 41:32.164
Have you just been
standing there?

41:33.782 --> 41:35.000
I heard you pull up.

41:40.623 --> 41:43.175
What are we gonna do, Charlie?

41:43.667 --> 41:46.428
Just keep avoiding each other
and hope that this goes away?

41:48.839 --> 41:50.307
It's probably not gonna go away.

41:53.552 --> 41:54.853
Because you were right.

41:55.679 --> 41:59.441
I mean, um, I've thought
a lot about it.

42:00.935 --> 42:03.487
And, yeah, I want
to have children.

42:04.772 --> 42:07.991
And, uh, I want to have
children with you.

42:09.193 --> 42:10.327
But...

42:14.782 --> 42:16.458
I want to be with you more.

42:19.828 --> 42:22.474
And, you know, as for kids,

42:22.498 --> 42:23.841
I mean, it's...

42:25.251 --> 42:27.344
something we sort
of already have.

42:44.186 --> 42:45.612
It seems pretty simple to me.

42:49.817 --> 42:51.493
But I think we should
make it official.

42:54.071 --> 42:56.174
I talked it over with
everybody, and they said yes.

42:56.198 --> 42:57.374
So...

42:59.034 --> 43:00.460
I want us to adopt him.

43:02.746 --> 43:04.172
So he'll be ours.

43:07.293 --> 43:10.721
And I know it won't
be the same thing.

43:18.470 --> 43:20.063
Is that enough for you?

43:22.349 --> 43:23.567
Yeah.
