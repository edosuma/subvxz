WEBVTT

00:03.069 --> 00:06.470
There. Finally, this family's
gonna start eating healthy.

00:06.639 --> 00:08.402
What do you think?

00:09.576 --> 00:13.706
I think it's too good
to be wasted on the hired help.

00:15.715 --> 00:18.343
- Hey, hey. Good morning, Aunt Viv.
- Oh, my.

00:21.554 --> 00:24.455
Look who's dressed up
for his first day at work. You look nice.

00:24.624 --> 00:27.991
Come on. Don't sweat me, Aunt Viv.
Don't sweat me. Don't sweat me.

00:28.161 --> 00:29.958
Give them back.

00:31.898 --> 00:32.922
Hey, Carlton. Look.

00:33.099 --> 00:35.693
I don't know what you talking about, man.
All right?

00:35.869 --> 00:37.268
Carlton, what are...? Carlton!

00:37.437 --> 00:39.905
Carlton, what are you doing, man?
Carlton!

00:40.073 --> 00:41.597
What is going on here?

00:41.775 --> 00:45.802
I got my job interview in a half hour
at the bank and Will's wearing my argyles.

00:46.279 --> 00:48.645
Carlton, get off. Get off, man.

00:48.815 --> 00:51.511
You want your stupid socks back
you can have them.

00:51.684 --> 00:54.778
Probably ain't gonna help
my foot fungus anyway.

00:55.822 --> 00:57.483
Keep them.

00:59.592 --> 01:01.116
- Morning, Ashley.
- Good morning.

01:01.294 --> 01:03.785
Has anyone seen my black leotard?

01:06.199 --> 01:08.064
That ain't funny.

01:09.035 --> 01:10.798
Philip, you think you'll be home late?

01:10.970 --> 01:13.939
Probably. Jury selection's taking a lot longer
than we thought.

01:14.107 --> 01:15.768
Could even spill over into tomorrow.

01:15.942 --> 01:19.469
Tomorrow? Daddy, tomorrow's Career Day.
You're still gonna speak, right?

01:19.646 --> 01:21.876
- Don't worry, Ashley. I'll be there.
- Oh, okay.

01:22.048 --> 01:24.346
Wait, wait. Hold up. Hold up.
Hold up, Ashley.

01:24.517 --> 01:27.918
Y'all having a Career Day?
I mean, why you ain't asked me?

01:28.088 --> 01:32.491
I'm sure all the kids at school wanna know
what an assistant talent coordinator does.

01:32.859 --> 01:34.156
Well, what do they do?

01:34.794 --> 01:36.421
What do they do?

01:40.400 --> 01:42.334
I'm gonna get back to you on that, Ash.

01:42.502 --> 01:45.869
- Breakfast is served.
Oh, good. Good.

01:49.642 --> 01:52.406
I think I'll pick up something
down at the courthouse.

01:52.579 --> 01:53.671
- I'm sick.
- Me too.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.748
- I'm sick. I'm sick.
I'll get something at school, Mom.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074

03:15.128 --> 03:16.618
Hilary, how you doing?

03:16.796 --> 03:18.388
Oh, how does it look like I'm doing?

03:18.565 --> 03:22.729
My throat is sore. My eyes are dry.
Every bone in my body aches.

03:22.902 --> 03:26.804
And my nose is so clogged up
I can't even smell my Obsession.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.008
Great. You'll be ready
to meet Mr. Stimple tomorrow.

03:30.176 --> 03:32.940
- Mr. Dipple?
- No, no. Not Dipple. Stimple.

03:33.112 --> 03:34.374
That's what I said. Dipple.

03:34.547 --> 03:37.072
Right. The guy we're trying to get
to sponsor our show.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.411
But I can't do it tomorrow.
I'm almost dead.

03:39.586 --> 03:42.419
Well, if you don't do it tomorrow
the show will be dead.

03:46.092 --> 03:49.357
Hey, excuse me, man. I was wondering
if you... If you... If you could...

03:49.529 --> 03:53.226
Excu... Excuse... Excuse me, sweetheart.
Could... Could... Could you...?

03:53.800 --> 03:56.701
Catch up with you at the commissary, baby.
All right?

03:57.937 --> 04:00.872
Hey, hey. Werner, what's up?
Hey, how you doing?

04:01.040 --> 04:03.873
Listen, I just wanna say
how great it is to be here...

04:04.043 --> 04:06.876
...and I wanted you to know
that l... I'm ready for anything.

04:07.046 --> 04:09.412
Whoa, you are a tiger. I like that.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.812
Rawr. Great. Ha, ha, ha.

04:13.519 --> 04:15.248
Well, let's see.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.911
Anything. Anything.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.990
We do have something important
going on.

04:19.158 --> 04:21.183
- We have a potential sponsor coming.
- Oh, great.

04:21.361 --> 04:23.829
- Everything must be perfect.
- Perfect. I'm your man.

04:23.997 --> 04:27.091
- We really want to impress this guy.
- Impress him. I am with you.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.667
What you need me to do?
Take him out to dinner?

04:29.836 --> 04:31.303
Show him the town? Anything.

04:31.471 --> 04:35.805
Actually, I need you
to move those boxes.

04:35.975 --> 04:37.306
Boxes.

04:37.677 --> 04:40.077
- Boxes?
- To the Xerox room.

04:43.449 --> 04:44.473
Boxes.

04:46.719 --> 04:48.778
Hey. But listen,
you know, after I do that...

04:48.955 --> 04:52.083
...I think I'll be really ready
for some serious responsibility.

04:52.258 --> 04:55.557
Don't worry. Soon you'll have
more responsibility than you can handle.

04:55.728 --> 04:57.457
All right.

04:58.097 --> 05:00.895
Who ordered a Chinese chicken salad?

05:04.704 --> 05:06.171
How's the jury selection going?

05:06.339 --> 05:09.831
Oh, it's exhausting. We're still
four jurors short and I don't know if...

05:10.009 --> 05:12.239
This isn't gonna keep you
from coming to school?

05:12.412 --> 05:16.439
Well, if we don't find them,
we'll just go with whatever we have.

05:19.719 --> 05:22.017
Geoffrey, make me a sandwich.

05:22.188 --> 05:24.418
- May I remind you, sir...
- No, you may not.

05:24.590 --> 05:26.319
Just make me a sandwich.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.622
As you wish, sir.

05:29.562 --> 05:32.895
I don't mean to brag, but you're looking
at the next junior executive...

05:33.066 --> 05:34.931
...at the California International Bank.

05:35.101 --> 05:37.194
Well, they hired you on the spot,
huh, son?

05:37.370 --> 05:42.103
Well, they haven't actually hired me yet,
but their body language was pretty clear.

05:43.976 --> 05:45.500
Body language?

05:45.678 --> 05:47.805
Sure.
They gave me the wink and the gun.

05:49.282 --> 05:50.476
You know.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.351
When they give you the wink
and the gun that means:

05:55.521 --> 05:56.988
"Hey, you're our man."

05:59.926 --> 06:01.951
- Hey, hey. What's up, guys?
Hey, Will.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.795
How did your first day go?

06:03.963 --> 06:05.590
Oh, it was great, Uncle Phil.

06:05.765 --> 06:08.962
Listen, after I got finished changing
light bulbs and moving boxes...

06:09.135 --> 06:11.126
...they gave me something important
to do.

06:11.304 --> 06:14.068
I moved a big box.

06:15.241 --> 06:17.573
Well, that's the problem
with menial jobs, Will.

06:17.744 --> 06:19.769
You're at the mercy
of someone else's whims.

06:19.946 --> 06:23.814
Now, if you'd have taken a more executive
corporate-like endeavor such as myself...

06:23.983 --> 06:25.382
...then you'd be your own man.

06:25.551 --> 06:28.645
Not sitting around like some puppet
waiting to be beckoned.

06:30.022 --> 06:31.922
That's them. That's them.

06:33.626 --> 06:35.184
Hello?

06:35.962 --> 06:39.557
No. She's not here right now.
She'll call you tomorrow.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.694
Ashley, call Felicia tomorrow.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.332
What did you do that for?

06:45.505 --> 06:46.972
I need to keep the line clear.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.108
- I'm calling her upstairs.
- Oh, no, you're not.

06:49.275 --> 06:50.640
Yes, I am.
Oh, no, you're not.

06:50.810 --> 06:51.902
Who put you in charge?

06:52.078 --> 06:53.670
I did. I am Carlton. You are not...

06:55.381 --> 06:58.544
- I'll talk to you later on, Uncle Phil.
- You know, Will...

06:58.985 --> 07:01.283
...my first job was in a law clerk's office.

07:01.821 --> 07:05.780
It was the summer of my freshman year
in college and I thought I was...

07:07.160 --> 07:08.923
...all that.

07:15.067 --> 07:19.800
Anyway, I spent most of my days
making coffee and copying legal documents.

07:19.972 --> 07:22.236
And that was before Xerox machines.

07:23.042 --> 07:25.510
Dag. Who was your boss? Mr. Slate?

07:30.950 --> 07:33.510
<i>He was on The Flintstones.</i>

07:35.321 --> 07:36.982
Go ahead, uncle.

07:37.423 --> 07:38.754
Well, the point is...

07:38.925 --> 07:43.419
...one day I decided to take some initiative
and make myself more important to them.

07:43.596 --> 07:45.427
You know, it worked.

07:45.798 --> 07:48.699
- Hm. Initiative, huh?
Yeah.

07:48.868 --> 07:50.563
Your sandwich, sir.

07:50.736 --> 07:52.704
Thank you, Geoffrey.

07:58.644 --> 07:59.668
What is this?

07:59.846 --> 08:02.679
Tofu and rice cakes.

08:02.849 --> 08:04.339
I tried to warn you.

08:04.517 --> 08:07.350
Mrs. Banks has run amuck.

08:07.520 --> 08:08.544
Geoffrey. Geoffrey.

08:08.721 --> 08:11.246
Now, if you'll go to my office
and look in my desk...

08:11.424 --> 08:13.585
Gone, sir.

08:14.293 --> 08:17.694
- My pimento loaf?
- I'm afraid so, sir.

08:18.097 --> 08:22.864
- But I still have some bologna in the...
- She got that too, sir.

08:23.069 --> 08:26.095
Man, Aunt Viv got skills.

08:26.272 --> 08:28.536
Hey, look, Uncle Phil, what do you say...

08:28.708 --> 08:31.939
...we slide down to Mickey D's
before she clean them out too.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.442
- Initiative.
- Yes, sir.

08:33.613 --> 08:35.205
Yes.

08:39.385 --> 08:42.616
So do you think that you could render
an impartial verdict...

08:42.788 --> 08:44.187
...in accordance with the law?

08:44.590 --> 08:47.320
Oh, I know I can. I must.

08:47.493 --> 08:49.290
I've been ordered to.

08:49.462 --> 08:52.124
Ordered? By whom?

08:53.366 --> 08:55.231
Alex Trebek.

08:59.305 --> 09:02.069
I'd like to thank our guest,
Mitchell Conklin...

09:02.241 --> 09:06.371
...for sharing his heartbreaking story
of a life with no friends.

09:06.846 --> 09:09.280
Well, Mr. Mitchell Conklin...

09:09.448 --> 09:10.938
...I'm your friend.

09:12.852 --> 09:16.049
Come back tomorrow for more of me.
Hilary.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.157
And we're out.

09:19.325 --> 09:22.260
- I'd just like to thank you for...
- Not now.

09:23.029 --> 09:24.053
Great show.

09:25.665 --> 09:29.658
Ew! Could somebody please
get me a Kleenex?

09:30.703 --> 09:33.831
Oh, look at me. I'm getting all puffy.

09:34.006 --> 09:35.906
- Werner, what am I gonna do?
- Well, I...

09:36.342 --> 09:38.242
It's done, Hil. I just...

09:38.411 --> 09:40.276
I just went and I got her some medicine.

09:40.446 --> 09:42.209
You know, I took a little initiative.

09:42.381 --> 09:45.873
Initiative. I like that. You know,
thinking ahead will get you ahead.

09:46.052 --> 09:47.451
Little story. When I started...

09:47.620 --> 09:51.056
Hello? Aren't I the patient?
Shouldn't I be getting all the attention?

09:51.223 --> 09:53.487
Will, why don't you go
help Hilary relax?

09:53.659 --> 09:54.683
Oh, yes, sir.

09:54.860 --> 09:57.226
Oh, hey, I just wanted tell you.

09:57.396 --> 09:59.864
I'm really starting to feel
like part of the team around here.

10:00.032 --> 10:02.500
Heh, heh. Don't ever touch me.

10:03.169 --> 10:06.764
Just gotta learn the rules, man.
Just gotta learn the rules.

10:10.943 --> 10:14.379
Mr. Jackson, why do you think
you'd make a good juror?

10:14.547 --> 10:18.278
Because I could always tell if someone
was guilty just by looking at them.

10:19.418 --> 10:21.511
Sir, even I can't tell by looking.

10:21.687 --> 10:24.349
And they let you be a judge.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.167
My brain is all clouded.

10:35.334 --> 10:37.325
My head's all fogged up.

10:37.503 --> 10:39.368
And I can't think straight.

10:39.538 --> 10:42.371
And now you've got a cold on top of it.

10:42.608 --> 10:45.099
Will, just fix it.

10:45.611 --> 10:47.579
Here you go, Catwoman.

10:54.286 --> 10:56.345
See? You getting better already.

10:59.458 --> 11:02.291
- Soy meatloaf, madam?
- Yes, Geoffrey.

11:02.461 --> 11:06.124
I am through serving
that fat-filled cholesterol-ridden mess.

11:06.298 --> 11:10.200
Say what you will,
but he is a good provider.

11:13.906 --> 11:15.897
I knew that's why they didn't call.

11:16.075 --> 11:17.736
Geoffrey, I told you no calls.

11:17.910 --> 11:21.277
- Master Carlton, I was just...
- Damn you and your excuses.

11:21.447 --> 11:24.644
Sit down and relax.

11:24.817 --> 11:26.284
You're right.

11:26.452 --> 11:27.851
Geoffrey, I'm sorry.

11:30.056 --> 11:34.049
Touch that and you'll be on
the first thing smoking back to London.

11:35.594 --> 11:38.427
Carlton Banks' office. Please hold.

11:38.898 --> 11:40.923
Carlton Banks here.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.024
Oh, hi, Dad.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.227
I thought it was someone important.

11:46.739 --> 11:49.970
But I can't. I'm waiting on a phone...

11:51.444 --> 11:53.378
Fine.

11:53.612 --> 11:56.103
- Is everything okay?
- Dad's still interviewing jurors.

11:56.282 --> 11:59.183
I've gotta go to Ashley's school
and tell her he can't make it.

11:59.351 --> 12:03.082
Look, if anyone calls just give them
my cell phone number. Thanks.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.747
Keep the lines clear.

12:05.925 --> 12:08.792
Certainly, Master Carlton.

12:09.261 --> 12:10.990
Whoops.

12:12.865 --> 12:15.390
Hey. Yo, Hil, Mr. Stimple's here to...

12:15.568 --> 12:20.665
Well,
what do you know? It's Uncle Cousin Will.

12:22.041 --> 12:25.943
Oh, I feel much better.

12:27.513 --> 12:30.482
That was some good tea.

12:31.517 --> 12:33.849
I love you.

12:35.521 --> 12:39.116
Hil, Hil, Hil. Hey, come here.
Come here. Come here. Wait right here.

12:43.395 --> 12:45.192
"Use only before bedtime.

12:45.364 --> 12:47.423
Do not operate heavy machinery."

12:47.600 --> 12:50.797
Good thing we're not on a tractor, huh?
Ha-ha-ha.

13:07.319 --> 13:08.581
Hilary. Come here. Come here.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.289
You gotta get yourself together
for your sponsor.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.257
Oh, Mr. Pimple? Bring him in.

13:16.428 --> 13:18.225
No. It's Mr. Stimple.

13:18.397 --> 13:21.889
Bring him in too. The more the merrier.
But we're gonna need some more tea.

13:22.334 --> 13:24.393
No. Ah, ah, ah.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.229
I think you missed the last call.

13:26.405 --> 13:27.736
Come on, walk it off. Walk it off.

13:27.907 --> 13:28.999
<i>I'm a little teapot</i>

13:29.175 --> 13:30.574
Hilary.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.233
Now breathe, breathe.

13:36.682 --> 13:38.582
You are not trying here, young lady.

13:42.621 --> 13:45.112
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Come on. Walk it off.

13:45.291 --> 13:48.488
Oh, Will. You're tickling me. Stop.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.292
Werner is wondering
what's taking so long.

13:52.464 --> 13:53.931
Candace, hi.

13:54.099 --> 13:56.363
Have you met my cousin, Will?

13:56.535 --> 13:58.469
Isn't he cute?

13:59.238 --> 14:00.466
Uh, uh...

14:00.639 --> 14:03.369
- She had too much medicine.
- Ha, ha, yeah, right.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.442
Wait. Hey. Hey. Wait. Wait a minute.

14:05.611 --> 14:08.705
Now listen, you go down there
and you stall Werner and Mr. Stimple.

14:08.881 --> 14:12.214
- All right? I'm gonna take care of Hilary.
- Okay. But wait a minute...

14:14.753 --> 14:19.190
- Hilary.
- Hilary go night-night.

14:23.395 --> 14:26.057
I can't believe this is happening.
Dad promised.

14:26.232 --> 14:29.326
Buck up, Ashley.
Life is filled with disappointments.

14:29.501 --> 14:31.765
I am the only person
who doesn't have a speaker.

14:31.937 --> 14:33.302
I'm gonna look like an idiot.

14:33.472 --> 14:37.272
Once again, Carlton Banks to the rescue.
When do I go on?

14:37.443 --> 14:41.641
No. No. Carlton, it's Career Day.
You don't even have a job.

14:42.214 --> 14:46.207
If you don't want the next junior executive
at the California International Bank...

14:46.385 --> 14:49.752
Okay. Okay. Fine.
I'll go tell them to introduce you.

14:52.458 --> 14:55.052
Carlton Banks' office. Please hold.

14:58.197 --> 14:59.960
Carlton Banks here.

15:00.132 --> 15:02.657
Oh, yes. The job, of course.

15:02.835 --> 15:03.859
Uh-huh.

15:04.036 --> 15:05.799
Yes.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.872
Huh?

15:08.507 --> 15:09.804
But I don't understand.

15:09.975 --> 15:13.809
You can't give a guy the wink and the gun
and then not give him a job.

15:14.513 --> 15:17.676
Buck up? Buck off.

15:19.418 --> 15:23.787
Our next speaker is Ashley's brother,
Mr. Carlton Banks.

15:27.159 --> 15:30.151
And here is where we hide our star.

15:31.530 --> 15:34.363
Hey.

15:36.835 --> 15:39.668
How you doing?

15:42.775 --> 15:45.335
You must be Mr. Stimple.

15:45.511 --> 15:48.674
How you doing?
I'm Hilary's hair designer, Diante.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.473
Pleasure.

15:51.650 --> 15:55.484
Oh, why didn't you tell me
he had such lustrous hairs?

15:56.455 --> 15:57.479
Oh, excuse me.

15:57.656 --> 15:59.180
I'm doing girlfriend's hair.

15:59.358 --> 16:01.792
She is so excited to meet you.
Just later.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.986
Well, I'd kind of like to meet her now.

16:04.163 --> 16:05.960
Uh, Hilary, I've never seen the program.

16:06.131 --> 16:09.567
Do you stand and interview a guest,
or do you run all around like Donahue?

16:09.735 --> 16:11.396
Oh, listen. Hilary can do it all.

16:11.570 --> 16:13.538
You know, she can stand.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.537
She can run.

16:15.708 --> 16:20.270
You know, she's like Ricki Lake and Oprah
and Donahue all wrapped up in one.

16:20.446 --> 16:23.313
Around here we call her, Ricki-Oprah-hue.

16:25.050 --> 16:28.315
Very clever word play,
but I'd like to hear what Hilary has to say.

16:28.787 --> 16:32.780
Oh, see, she like real shy.

16:32.958 --> 16:37.258
You know, she can't really verbalize
with you till she gets to know you.

16:37.429 --> 16:39.454
You know what I mean?

16:44.436 --> 16:46.267
Of course. Where's my head?

16:46.438 --> 16:48.269
Fred Stimple. Stimple Rubber. Pleasure.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.841
Oh, no, you don't. Honey,
it took me an hour to do them nails.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.206
You a Leo, ain't you?

16:58.384 --> 17:01.785
And in conclusion, if you follow these steps
as I have outlined...

17:01.954 --> 17:04.548
...then I guarantee you'll be successful.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.718
Thank you.

17:08.727 --> 17:10.786
You still haven't told us what you do.

17:13.232 --> 17:17.931
Well, I was previously
in expeditious comestible management.

17:18.103 --> 17:24.338
And currently,
I'm overseeing a myriad of options.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.744
Do you even have a job?

17:26.912 --> 17:28.345
Well, strictly speaking, l...

17:28.513 --> 17:30.004
He's a bum
just like my Uncle Eddie.

17:32.217 --> 17:35.118
Excuse me, sir. Are you really a bum?

17:35.287 --> 17:36.754
Back off, sister.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.359
- You got an attitude problem.
- Damn right I've got attitude.

17:41.527 --> 17:44.189
Just wait till you grow up.
You'll see how tough it is.

17:44.363 --> 17:46.024
There are sharks out there...

17:46.198 --> 17:48.894
...and you're all little guppies
waiting to be devoured.

17:50.302 --> 17:53.760
Sure, you can lie back in your
protective little womb called high school...

17:53.939 --> 17:55.804
...and pretend the world is your oyster.

17:55.974 --> 18:00.274
But one day it's gonna turn on you like
the rotting milk in your stinking lunchboxes.

18:02.848 --> 18:04.406
Thank you.

18:14.893 --> 18:17.726
You know, with a touch of henna
and a kiss of ash blond...

18:17.896 --> 18:20.194
...you're gonna need yourself
a beeper, girl.

18:21.300 --> 18:26.033
Diante, you're a very unusual man,
but I grow tired.

18:26.405 --> 18:28.134
- Who are you?
- Aah!

18:28.307 --> 18:30.969
Who am I?
I'm Mr. Stimple. Stimple Rubber.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.475
Oh, my God. Mr. Stimple.

18:33.645 --> 18:34.942
Will.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.241
Will? I thought you were Diante?

18:37.416 --> 18:39.407
Diante?

18:42.855 --> 18:44.880
There's a good explanation for all of this.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.890
Save it. This has been, uh, different.

18:49.027 --> 18:52.121
Excuse me, Mr. Stimple. Um, I'm sorry.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.265
Mr. Stimple.

18:54.433 --> 18:57.493
Look, my name is not Diante.
My name is Will.

18:57.669 --> 18:58.966
I'm Hilary's cousin.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.835
Now look,
this is all quite simple, Mr. Stimple.

19:03.108 --> 19:08.341
I'm sorry. Listen. Look, my uncle told me
I should take some initiative.

19:08.514 --> 19:11.881
I got nighttime-so-you-could-sleep instead
of daytime-so-you-could-think medicine.

19:12.050 --> 19:14.314
Man, how is she supposed
to drive a tractor?

19:14.486 --> 19:18.422
So I said, "Aah!" And, you know,
she said, "Aah!" You know what I'm saying?

19:18.590 --> 19:21.320
- You're Hilary's cousin?
- Exactly.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.859
This is the worst day of my life,
Mr. Stimple.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.728
I'm so sorry.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.264
No need to apologize.
I know all about nepotism.

19:28.433 --> 19:31.834
I got a factory full of idiot nephews
and worthless brother-in-laws.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.601
With only one moronic cousin
running around...

19:34.773 --> 19:36.035
...you're way ahead of the game.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.815
He said, "Moronic cousin." Ha, ha.

19:44.983 --> 19:47.884
Hey. Hold up, man.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.722
Fine. I understand your having to work.

19:53.892 --> 19:56.258
I even understand
you missing Career Day.

19:56.428 --> 19:59.329
What I don't understand
is how you could possibly send Carlton.

19:59.498 --> 20:02.160
I mean, you could've sent Mom.
You could've sent Geoffrey.

20:02.334 --> 20:04.359
You could've even sent the pool guy.

20:05.604 --> 20:07.299
He answered the phone?

20:09.408 --> 20:12.343
I understand you taking initiative.
I even understand the tea.

20:12.511 --> 20:16.277
But what I don't understand
is how this happened?

20:17.149 --> 20:20.915
Uh, see, well, you bobbed
when you should've weaved.

20:26.592 --> 20:28.355
Sorry.

20:29.161 --> 20:30.526
Dinner is served.

20:30.963 --> 20:34.421
- I'm sick. I'm sick.
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on!

20:34.600 --> 20:35.862
Now, we have to do this.

20:36.034 --> 20:38.696
Oh, sure. Now our responsibilities kick in.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.109
Look at you.

20:55.287 --> 20:57.221
I can't believe you're acting like this.

20:57.389 --> 21:00.688
All I'm trying to do
is look out for everybody here.

21:00.859 --> 21:04.727
Honey, don't you wanna live longer?
Don't you wanna feel better?

21:08.834 --> 21:12.031
Last one to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles
ain't eating.

21:17.909 --> 21:20.605
I understand there were other applicants.

21:20.879 --> 21:23.939
I even understand I was too young
for the job.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.714
But what I don't understand...

21:26.885 --> 21:30.412
...is they gave me the wink and the gun.

21:31.723 --> 21:34.556
They gave me the wink and the gun.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.494
Buck up, pal.
