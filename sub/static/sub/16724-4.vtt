WEBVTT

00:05.380 --> 00:06.848
(birds squawking, gobbling)

00:06.729 --> 00:08.530
Whoa. Those are the birds?

00:08.564 --> 00:09.931
W-why they making that noise?

00:09.965 --> 00:11.132
Hell if I know.

00:11.167 --> 00:12.233
They've been screeching that way

00:12.268 --> 00:13.435
for the last eight hours.

00:13.469 --> 00:14.736
Where are they from?
They came

00:14.770 --> 00:16.271
from a horrible
crappy farm, okay?

00:16.305 --> 00:18.039
Just sign the form.
I want to get out of here.

00:18.074 --> 00:19.140
Those birds
give me the creeps.

00:19.175 --> 00:20.141
Come on, how bad can it be?

00:20.176 --> 00:21.409
They're just a bunch

00:21.444 --> 00:22.544
of cute little birdies.

00:22.578 --> 00:24.079
They're probably hungry.

00:24.113 --> 00:25.547
Yeah. Here you go, buddy.

00:25.581 --> 00:26.715
You want some pretzel?

00:26.749 --> 00:28.049
(screams)

00:28.084 --> 00:29.084
My hand!

00:29.118 --> 00:30.318
My hand!

00:30.353 --> 00:31.653
Not your beautiful hand!

00:31.687 --> 00:33.488
(shrieking)

00:37.626 --> 00:39.427
TINA:
Whoa. Look out, everyone.

00:39.462 --> 00:40.895
Dangerous curves ahead.

00:40.930 --> 00:42.430
♪ Turkey trot, looking hot

00:42.465 --> 00:44.132
♪ Do you like
these pants I got? ♪

00:44.166 --> 00:45.300
Ha-ha! Do you?

00:45.334 --> 00:46.301
Bob, do you?

00:46.335 --> 00:47.435
Yes. I like them.

00:47.470 --> 00:48.903
They're... fine.
I love them.

00:48.938 --> 00:50.572
Wait, wait.
Let me put my belt on.

00:50.606 --> 00:52.140
You sure you got
enough water, Mom?

00:52.174 --> 00:53.608
Hey, you got to stay hydrated.

00:53.642 --> 00:55.076
Plus, look how little they are!

00:55.111 --> 00:57.078
So tiny. Aw!

00:57.113 --> 00:58.780
Ooh, can't wait
to get out there.

00:58.814 --> 01:00.949
500 live turkeys
running with us.
Mm.

01:00.983 --> 01:03.017
It's gonna be like the running
of the bulls but cute and safe!

01:03.052 --> 01:04.486
Mm-hmm.

01:04.519 --> 01:05.987
And we'll be on the
half-priced rides

01:06.021 --> 01:07.355
having full-priced fun.

01:07.390 --> 01:08.523
Dad, are you still mad at us

01:08.557 --> 01:09.958
for going to the festival?

01:09.992 --> 01:11.626
Mad!? No, I'm thrilled!

01:11.660 --> 01:13.661
Because you were kind of
mad the other day.

01:13.696 --> 01:15.930
What?
No, I was... I wasn't.

01:15.965 --> 01:18.800
Oh, right! 'Cause that's
what Thanksgiving is for,

01:18.834 --> 01:21.102
running around with a bunch
of birds and going on rides!

01:21.137 --> 01:23.104
Well, fine! Go!
But you know what?

01:23.139 --> 01:24.706
I'm not making dinner!

01:24.740 --> 01:26.040
He's taking this pretty well.

01:26.075 --> 01:27.609
No, you're crying!

01:27.643 --> 01:29.544
I just calmly said
that if you all go

01:29.578 --> 01:31.379
to Fischoeder's dumb
festival instead of spending

01:31.414 --> 01:33.681
the day here, I will
not be making dinner.

01:33.716 --> 01:34.983
Day off for old Bob.

01:35.017 --> 01:36.684
No big deal.
No big deal!

01:36.719 --> 01:38.520
The turkey baster
is in the drawer,

01:38.554 --> 01:41.022
probably pretty happy
not to work, and so am I.

01:41.056 --> 01:42.724
All right, come on.
Don't want to be late

01:42.758 --> 01:45.660
for the Turk-tacular Turkey
Town Festival and Turkey Trot.

01:45.694 --> 01:47.162
(kids cheer)
(whoops)

01:47.196 --> 01:49.864
Fine! You all go have
a Turk-tacular time.

01:49.899 --> 01:51.499
So, we'll bring home
some Chinese food?

01:51.534 --> 01:52.967
Yup! Or whatever you want

01:53.002 --> 01:55.170
for Thanks...
I mean, regular dinner.

01:55.204 --> 01:57.372
Okay, don't start a
brothel while we're gone.

01:57.406 --> 01:58.740
Just kidding, you can.

01:58.774 --> 02:00.542
And no making a fort
out of the couch cushions.

02:00.576 --> 02:02.010
Just kidding, you can.

02:02.044 --> 02:03.344
But don't turn
that fort into a brothel.

02:03.379 --> 02:04.679
Just kidding, you can.

02:04.713 --> 02:05.713
Oh, my God, just...

02:05.748 --> 02:06.748
I mean,
it's illegal, but...

02:06.782 --> 02:07.949
I know. Just leave.

02:09.018 --> 02:10.884
Nice stems!

02:10.919 --> 02:13.588
Thank you. I'm wearing hose
to compress my varicose veins.

02:13.622 --> 02:15.857
Teddy! I didn't know
you were gonna run.

02:15.891 --> 02:17.158
Oh, I'll probably walk.

02:17.193 --> 02:18.827
I just wanted
to see the turkeys.

02:18.861 --> 02:20.562
I worked on a turkey ranch
one summer, when I was 14.

02:20.596 --> 02:22.096
I learned a lot about life.

02:22.131 --> 02:23.698
And a lot about turkey feces.

02:23.732 --> 02:25.567
Sounds like
a magical summer, Teddy.

02:25.601 --> 02:27.235
Now let's hit the rides!

02:27.269 --> 02:28.870
We're not gonna get whiplash
just standing here!

02:28.904 --> 02:29.904
Good luck, Mom.

02:29.939 --> 02:31.339
Bob at home, cooking away?

02:31.373 --> 02:33.608
Nah. He's boycotting
Thanksgiving this year.

02:33.642 --> 02:34.776
(gasps) What?
Yeah.

02:34.810 --> 02:35.910
But Bob loves Thanksgiving.

02:35.945 --> 02:37.378
I know. He's mad

02:37.413 --> 02:38.913
that we all wanted
to come here instead of sitting

02:38.948 --> 02:40.682
around on the couch all day,
waiting for food.

02:40.716 --> 02:42.250
Poor Bob.
What a tragedy.

02:42.284 --> 02:44.118
Well, the real tragedy
is that I don't have

02:44.153 --> 02:45.753
time to get nachos
before we start.

02:45.788 --> 02:47.288
You know what? Maybe I do.

02:47.323 --> 02:49.390
So, I say we start
on the Scramble Pan

02:49.425 --> 02:51.092
and work our way back
through Violent Mountain

02:51.126 --> 02:52.594
and then the Bruise Cruise.

02:52.628 --> 02:54.362
I wouldn't mind a trip
on the Tickle Boat.

02:54.396 --> 02:55.563
But, Gene,
they closed it, remember?

02:55.598 --> 02:56.764
That guy died.

02:56.799 --> 02:57.899
Oh, right.

02:57.933 --> 02:59.567
But what a way to go!
Yeah.

02:59.602 --> 03:01.536
Scramble Pan it is!

03:01.570 --> 03:04.038
This is... great?

03:04.073 --> 03:07.542
Not celebrating Thanksgiving
is kind of great.

03:07.576 --> 03:09.544
I like it. I'm alone.

03:09.578 --> 03:10.979
I can do whatever I want.

03:11.013 --> 03:13.648
I could sit in my not-usual spot
on the couch.

03:13.682 --> 03:16.618
I could even cross my legs,
and no one would make fun of me.

03:16.652 --> 03:18.152
Felix?
Yes?

03:18.187 --> 03:19.554
Have all the turkeys been fed?

03:19.588 --> 03:21.055
We aren't going
to have a repeat

03:21.090 --> 03:23.091
of the unfortunate
finger nibbling incident?

03:23.125 --> 03:24.959
No, Calvin.
The turkeys are fine.

03:24.994 --> 03:26.261
And the chickens.
And the ducks.

03:26.295 --> 03:27.829
And the geese.
"Geese"?

03:27.863 --> 03:30.164
You were supposed to get
500 turkeys, Felix!

03:30.199 --> 03:31.499
You had one thing to do!

03:31.534 --> 03:33.001
- One!
- I tried!

03:33.035 --> 03:34.903
Turkeys are scarce right now,
for some reason!

03:34.937 --> 03:36.404
Oh, I wonder why
that could be!

03:36.438 --> 03:38.006
Oh, I'm sorry
I let you down again

03:38.040 --> 03:39.607
by buying a bunch of
dangerous birds that...

03:39.642 --> 03:40.742
(amplified):
(gasps) Oh, my God!

03:40.776 --> 03:41.809
The mic is on.

03:41.844 --> 03:43.578
- Hi!
- Oh, ho!

03:43.612 --> 03:45.346
I hope you all enjoyed
those Thanksgiving jokes

03:45.381 --> 03:46.648
we were just making.

03:46.682 --> 03:48.116
(both laugh uncomfortably)

03:48.150 --> 03:49.617
A little light
Thanksgiving humor.

03:49.652 --> 03:52.854
Oh, I love humor.
I do love to laugh!

03:52.888 --> 03:55.256
Now, on behalf of myself
and my brother Calvin,

03:55.291 --> 03:57.425
we'd like to welcome you
all to the first annual

03:57.459 --> 03:59.260
Turk-tacular Turkey
Town Festival!

03:59.295 --> 04:00.962
All right!

04:00.996 --> 04:02.330
Is everybody ready

04:02.364 --> 04:05.199
for some poultry in motion?

04:05.234 --> 04:07.135
(gobbling)

04:07.169 --> 04:08.603
Those birds don't sound right.

04:08.637 --> 04:10.204
Hey, Regular Sized Rudy.
I didn't know

04:10.239 --> 04:11.539
you were a scramblin' man.

04:11.574 --> 04:13.007
I'm not usually,
but since my parents

04:13.042 --> 04:15.143
are divorced,
I gotta have two dinners,

04:15.177 --> 04:17.278
so I'm trying to make myself
throw up breakfast.

04:17.313 --> 04:18.546
One time I had two dinners

04:18.581 --> 04:20.348
because Ollie was
too sick to eat his.

04:20.382 --> 04:22.183
I had malaria!

04:22.217 --> 04:24.018
Let's quit yakkin'
and get crackin'!

04:24.053 --> 04:25.286
Mickey, come on,
let's do this!

04:25.321 --> 04:26.621
Set it to maximum!

04:26.655 --> 04:28.523
Okay, hold onto your heads
like this

04:28.557 --> 04:30.058
so your necks won't break!

04:32.861 --> 04:35.830
And now, the beginning
of a new Thanksgiving tradition

04:35.864 --> 04:37.565
that's fun for the whole family.

04:37.600 --> 04:41.002
The Running of the Turkeys...
etcetera.

04:41.036 --> 04:43.871
On your mark... get set...

04:43.906 --> 04:44.872
go!

04:44.907 --> 04:46.007
(gobbling)

04:46.041 --> 04:47.075
(crowd clamoring)

04:47.109 --> 04:50.244
(laughing)

04:50.279 --> 04:51.846
Ow!

04:51.880 --> 04:53.548
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

04:53.582 --> 04:54.916
Linda! Run! Run!

04:54.950 --> 04:56.017
Run!
(woman screams)

04:56.051 --> 04:57.852
Oh. Oh...

04:57.886 --> 05:00.421
(runners screaming, clamoring)

05:00.456 --> 05:03.024
Pretty good, pretty good.

05:03.058 --> 05:05.326
I'll try right over left now.

05:05.361 --> 05:07.595
Mm, yup, yup.

05:07.630 --> 05:09.230
Also good.

05:09.264 --> 05:12.066
(runners yelling, clamoring)

05:12.101 --> 05:13.568
(man screams, chicken squawks)

05:15.070 --> 05:17.939
Oh, ah, no! Birds!
Birds! Birds! Birds!

05:17.973 --> 05:19.774
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Make way, make way!
Sorry. Hey...

05:19.808 --> 05:21.376
Coming through!
Here we go, pardon us.

05:21.410 --> 05:22.377
(panting)
Oh!

05:22.411 --> 05:23.378
(squawking)

05:23.412 --> 05:25.013
(Linda grunting)

05:25.047 --> 05:26.080
(yelling)

05:28.192 --> 05:29.192
(groans)

05:29.226 --> 05:30.493
What...? What happened?

05:30.527 --> 05:32.328
Aah! I'm short and wiggly!

05:32.363 --> 05:33.730
Ooh!
I'm tall and wiggly.

05:33.764 --> 05:35.398
Oh, oh, it's a fun mirror.

05:35.432 --> 05:36.532
It's a fun mirror.

05:38.535 --> 05:39.502
Aah!

05:39.536 --> 05:41.070
Linda! Aah!

05:41.105 --> 05:42.905
Linda, it's me, Teddy!
From your town!

05:42.940 --> 05:44.340
Teddy?
Wha-What's going on, Teddy?

05:44.375 --> 05:45.842
How did I get in here?

05:45.876 --> 05:47.577
When the birds attacked,
most people got away,

05:47.611 --> 05:50.213
but you got knocked out by this
freaky one-eyed cyclops turkey.

05:50.247 --> 05:51.781
So I picked you up
and carried you here.

05:51.815 --> 05:54.017
- Whoa! How long have I been out?
- A lot's changed.

05:54.051 --> 05:55.852
We don't have to start
repopulating the Earth yet,

05:55.886 --> 05:57.687
but eventually we might
have to do just that.

05:57.721 --> 05:59.088
- I don't know...
- Teddy!

05:59.123 --> 06:00.289
How long have I been in here?

06:00.324 --> 06:02.091
- Five, maybe six minutes.
- Oh.

06:02.126 --> 06:03.292
Oh, my God, the kids!

06:03.327 --> 06:04.293
Where are the kids?!

06:04.328 --> 06:08.431
But I'm a vegan! Aah!

06:08.465 --> 06:10.199
LOUISE: Ugh! I can't believe
Mickey left us here!

06:10.234 --> 06:12.101
Those birds are
getting awfully close.

06:12.136 --> 06:14.203
I hope they don't have
tickets for this ride!

06:14.238 --> 06:16.606
We got to get off this thing.
Andy, Ollie, you seem

06:16.640 --> 06:18.074
like you're up
for a challenge of getting

06:18.108 --> 06:19.575
off the ride
and shutting it down.

06:19.610 --> 06:21.110
We'll try anything.

06:21.145 --> 06:23.746
Yeah! I tried shrimp
at my aunt's house!

06:23.781 --> 06:25.548
Great. Go get 'em!

06:25.582 --> 06:26.916
(both grunting)

06:26.950 --> 06:28.818
Oh, what happened?

06:28.852 --> 06:30.553
We travelled through time!

06:30.587 --> 06:31.821
I guess I'll give it a whirl.

06:31.855 --> 06:33.222
Literally.

06:33.257 --> 06:36.025
(grunting)
...whoa!

06:37.461 --> 06:39.328
Hey. Welcome back.

06:39.363 --> 06:40.797
We're gonna die
like we were born.

06:40.831 --> 06:42.432
Spinning around in an egg!

06:42.466 --> 06:44.767
That really
makes you think.

06:44.802 --> 06:45.768
This is great.

06:45.803 --> 06:46.803
Don't have to keep

06:46.837 --> 06:47.904
getting up to baste.

06:47.938 --> 06:49.505
Baste not, want not.

06:49.540 --> 06:52.442
You get it?

06:52.476 --> 06:54.243
Yes.

06:54.278 --> 06:56.479
I don't have to storm
the Baste-ille.

06:56.513 --> 06:58.481
Eh. Get it?

06:58.515 --> 06:59.849
Kind of.

06:59.883 --> 07:01.951
It was a prison in France.

07:01.985 --> 07:03.953
The Bastille, and I said
"Baste-ille."

07:03.987 --> 07:05.021
Oh.

07:05.055 --> 07:06.189
I'm here live at the wharf

07:06.223 --> 07:07.423
where today's Turkey Trot

07:07.458 --> 07:08.791
turned into turkey terror.

07:08.826 --> 07:10.359
What exactly happened
in there today?

07:10.394 --> 07:12.462
I assure you
it wasn't that bad, really.

07:12.496 --> 07:14.263
I mean, people overreacted,
that's all.

07:14.298 --> 07:15.598
Those birds went crazy, man!

07:15.632 --> 07:17.867
They tried to kill us!
(grunting)

07:17.901 --> 07:20.603
Hey!
That man is clearly insane.

07:20.637 --> 07:22.038
You saw his outfit!

07:22.072 --> 07:24.006
So, you closed the gates
to keep the birds in?

07:24.041 --> 07:25.975
That's right.
Their wings are clipped.
Mm-hmm.

07:26.009 --> 07:27.477
That means
that they're contained.

07:27.511 --> 07:28.845
But what about the people?

07:28.879 --> 07:30.146
Was anyone left inside?

07:30.180 --> 07:33.049
No, that would be
a PR nightmare.

07:33.083 --> 07:34.617
Which we are not having today.

07:34.651 --> 07:36.018
No, thank you.

07:36.053 --> 07:37.286
No, today was nothing less

07:37.321 --> 07:38.554
than a total success.

07:38.589 --> 07:39.655
There's your headline!
Yes.

07:39.690 --> 07:40.690
Write that down.

07:40.724 --> 07:41.791
We're on live television.

07:41.825 --> 07:42.792
Then make it into a graphic.

07:42.826 --> 07:43.993
A fun one that spins in.

07:44.027 --> 07:44.994
(whooshing)

07:45.028 --> 07:46.229
Total success!

07:46.263 --> 07:47.530
- Yeah.
- We'll get right on that.

07:47.564 --> 07:48.664
Okay. Well, that went well.

07:48.699 --> 07:49.899
Yes. I think it did, too.

07:49.933 --> 07:51.000
Should we go home for dinner?

07:51.034 --> 07:52.869
- Yes, I am starving.
- Yeah.

07:52.903 --> 07:54.637
Did everyone get out,
by the way?

07:54.671 --> 07:56.239
- Uh... no. No, no.
- Ooh.

07:56.273 --> 07:57.974
I mean, they were screaming
when I closed the gates,

07:58.008 --> 07:59.575
so I don't think so.
(laughs)

07:59.610 --> 08:01.744
But who's gonna
believe them, right?

08:01.778 --> 08:03.513
Oh, ooh, we're still recording!

08:03.547 --> 08:05.248
- Oh, dear Lord!
- Well, look at that.

08:05.282 --> 08:06.482
- Yep.
- Happened twice now.

08:06.517 --> 08:07.884
Oh... well.

08:07.918 --> 08:09.318
Look at 'em.

08:09.353 --> 08:10.319
Where'd they come from,
poultry prison?

08:10.354 --> 08:11.654
Yeah, this is bad.

08:11.688 --> 08:13.089
Their pecking order's
all messed up.

08:13.123 --> 08:14.757
What? "Pecking order"?
What are you talking about?

08:14.791 --> 08:16.259
Every turkey group
has one guy

08:16.293 --> 08:18.327
who can peck everyone,
then the guy below him

08:18.362 --> 08:20.096
who can peck everyone
except for the top guy,

08:20.130 --> 08:22.498
and so on until the sad sack
who can't peck anyone.

08:22.533 --> 08:23.499
Oh, that's terrible--
it's like

08:23.534 --> 08:24.867
the ladies on The View.

08:24.902 --> 08:26.536
Yeah, with all these birds

08:26.570 --> 08:28.237
and people mixed in,
they don't know what to do.

08:28.272 --> 08:29.772
They're pecking everything!
It's chaos!

08:29.806 --> 08:31.040
Well, we still got
to go find the kids.

08:31.074 --> 08:32.942
Let's just tiptoe
past them. Ready?

08:32.976 --> 08:34.409
Ready.

08:38.881 --> 08:41.049
(both yelling,
turkeys gobbling)

08:41.083 --> 08:42.051
Run!

08:42.085 --> 08:44.487
(both grunting, panting)

08:47.658 --> 08:49.125
It's him-- Cyclops!

08:49.159 --> 08:50.793
That's the one who
knocked you down earlier.

08:50.827 --> 08:52.128
Oh, God, he hates me!

08:52.162 --> 08:53.362
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

08:53.397 --> 08:55.031
- I know what's happening!
- What?

08:55.065 --> 08:56.899
We rejected Thanksgiving
and now it's attacking us!

08:56.934 --> 08:58.901
That's crazy, Lin-- these
turkeys are just all mixed up.

08:58.936 --> 09:00.703
They were keeping them
with other birds.

09:00.737 --> 09:02.371
It's biology, not hocus pocus.

09:02.406 --> 09:03.873
Oh, I love that movie!

09:03.907 --> 09:05.741
Oh, how are we ever
gonna find the kids?

09:05.776 --> 09:07.143
MICKEY (over P.A.):
They're on the Scramble Pan.

09:07.177 --> 09:08.611
Oh, my God!
The birds have learned to talk!

09:08.645 --> 09:09.812
No, no!

09:09.846 --> 09:11.447
- It's me, Mickey.
- Mickey? Mickey?!

09:11.481 --> 09:12.982
The kids are on
the Scramble Pan?

09:13.016 --> 09:14.283
What? I-I can't hear you.

09:14.318 --> 09:15.651
- I said the...
- Turn on your microphone.

09:15.686 --> 09:16.919
- What?
- Here.

09:16.954 --> 09:18.154
(amplified over P.A.):
Uh, da....

09:18.188 --> 09:19.822
My kids are on
the Scramble Pan?

09:19.856 --> 09:21.290
Yeah, I, uh, saw them.

09:21.325 --> 09:22.725
As I was leaving them there,

09:22.759 --> 09:25.261
and, uh, running
over here to hide.

09:25.295 --> 09:26.729
You abandoned my kids?

09:26.763 --> 09:28.331
Eh... sort of.

09:28.365 --> 09:30.433
But, uh, you know,
they're safer on the ride,

09:30.467 --> 09:33.102
so I kind of did the right
thing, if-if you think about it!

09:33.136 --> 09:34.437
(gobbling, squawking)

09:34.471 --> 09:35.805
Oh, man.

09:35.839 --> 09:37.807
You can only eat
an animal for so long.

09:37.841 --> 09:39.642
It's the turkeys time
to rule the Earth now.

09:39.676 --> 09:41.477
We had our chance
and we blew it.

09:41.511 --> 09:43.279
No, it's the pecking order!

09:43.313 --> 09:45.314
It's the spirit of Thanksgiving!

09:45.349 --> 09:47.350
- That's crazy talk!
- Don't call me crazy.

09:47.384 --> 09:48.985
- That's not crazy talk.
- Guys, guys, guys, guys!

09:49.019 --> 09:50.152
- I didn't say you were crazy.
- We got to stop fighting!

09:50.187 --> 09:51.354
We're turning on each other.

09:51.388 --> 09:52.688
This is exactly what they want!

09:52.723 --> 09:54.090
We gotta get
the kids, Mickey.

09:54.124 --> 09:55.324
You gotta come with us.

09:55.359 --> 09:56.659
We need your help
to turn off the ride.

09:56.693 --> 09:58.094
I would love to do that, Linda.

09:58.128 --> 09:59.428
But I'm actually
really comfortable here,

09:59.463 --> 10:00.930
hiding in these stuffed animals.

10:00.964 --> 10:02.431
I just feel safe
with these guys, I'm sorry.

10:02.466 --> 10:03.766
- That looks nice.
- Oh!

10:03.800 --> 10:04.800
That gives me an idea!

10:04.835 --> 10:06.469
Mickey, we're coming over!

10:08.000 --> 10:14.074

10:16.813 --> 10:18.047
Hey, daytime whiskey.

10:18.081 --> 10:19.782
Want to meet my CD collection?

10:19.816 --> 10:21.484
I feel like you guys
would hit it off.

10:21.518 --> 10:22.685
Donna Summer?

10:22.719 --> 10:24.487
It's Summer time.

10:25.822 --> 10:28.824
(slow, sultry pop intro plays)

10:33.897 --> 10:37.333
DONNA SUMMER:

10:50.213 --> 10:51.380
Hey, wait,
is that Mom?

10:51.415 --> 10:52.648
Yes! She said
my name first!

10:52.683 --> 10:54.884
Mom! Help!

10:54.918 --> 10:56.752
- All right, Mickey,
turn it off.
- Can do.

10:56.787 --> 10:58.654
Oh, shoot-- I threw
the key into the ocean.

10:58.689 --> 11:00.723
- You what?
- I didn't want the
birds to get it.

11:00.757 --> 11:02.591
We can't let this technology
fall into their hands.

11:02.626 --> 11:04.327
Is there another way
to turn it off?

11:04.361 --> 11:06.162
Wait! There's a drunk operator
override switch on the ride!

11:06.196 --> 11:08.664
- What?!
- MICKEY: All the rides
in the park have them.

11:08.699 --> 11:10.833
In case the operator gets
drunk and goes on the ride,

11:10.867 --> 11:12.435
leaving no one
to turn it off.

11:12.469 --> 11:13.436
Oh, smart.

11:13.470 --> 11:14.704
Okay, here I go.

11:14.738 --> 11:17.073
Just like turning
off a bicycle.

11:17.107 --> 11:18.741
Oh, God, I'm gonna barf.

11:18.775 --> 11:20.376
Guys, I can do this.

11:20.410 --> 11:21.377
Oh, God.

11:21.411 --> 11:22.378
So dizzy.

11:22.412 --> 11:24.347
Oh, God, this is bad.

11:24.381 --> 11:25.448
Aah...

11:25.482 --> 11:26.549
So nauseous!

11:26.583 --> 11:27.550
Whoa...

11:27.584 --> 11:28.951
Seriously?!

11:28.985 --> 11:30.920
We've been on this thing
for a freaking hour,

11:30.954 --> 11:32.922
and no one's barfed.
Gene even had a snack.

11:32.956 --> 11:34.023
Looks like it's up to Mama.

11:34.057 --> 11:35.624
(Linda retches)

11:35.659 --> 11:38.961
Holy moly, this thing
cannot be safe for children.

11:38.995 --> 11:42.064
But you adults seem to be
doing really well with it!

11:42.099 --> 11:45.401
If only I had something to throw
at the switch.

11:45.435 --> 11:47.069
Oh, my God.

11:47.104 --> 11:48.237
My water babies.
(gags)

11:48.271 --> 11:49.238
Good-bye, baby bottle.

11:49.272 --> 11:50.973
Little Karen.

11:52.275 --> 11:53.743
LINDA:
Okay, no problem.

11:53.777 --> 11:55.211
I-I got nine more.

11:55.245 --> 11:56.746
Okay, this is the last one.

11:56.780 --> 11:58.280
Little Timmy,
you were always my favorite.

11:58.315 --> 12:00.383
Please let
someone else do it.

12:00.417 --> 12:02.084
I can do it!

12:02.953 --> 12:04.487
(buzzes)
- Yay!
- Nice!

12:04.521 --> 12:05.788
Way to go, Rudy!

12:05.822 --> 12:09.325
Rudy-- one, asthma--
zer... (gasps)

12:09.359 --> 12:10.760
Are you okay,
my babies?

12:10.794 --> 12:11.994
Yep, I'm probably
always gonna move

12:12.028 --> 12:13.262
in little circles
like this, though.

12:13.296 --> 12:14.263
Uh-oh.

12:14.297 --> 12:15.898
Looks like we've
got company.

12:15.932 --> 12:17.066
Bad company.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.267
And not the band!

12:18.301 --> 12:19.301
Probably.

12:19.336 --> 12:21.670
(gobbling, squawking)

12:21.705 --> 12:23.773
(siren wailing)

12:25.942 --> 12:27.843
Everyone relax,
we're here.

12:27.878 --> 12:29.345
Those birds are crazy--
look what one of them

12:29.379 --> 12:30.579
did to my nightstick.

12:30.614 --> 12:31.814
Please step aside.

12:31.848 --> 12:32.848
Let us take care
of this, all right?

12:32.883 --> 12:34.016
Who's in control?

12:34.050 --> 12:35.518
- Animal Control!
- Animal Control!

12:35.552 --> 12:36.552
Open 'em up!

LINDA:
Oh, God, we're surrounded.

12:58.871 --> 13:00.805
REGULAR SIZED RUDY: Who wants
to be in charge of my epi-pen?

13:00.839 --> 13:02.473
I'm allergic to
geese and ducks!

13:02.508 --> 13:04.842
I will not invite you to my
duck-duck-goose party, then.

13:04.877 --> 13:06.044
Understood.

13:06.078 --> 13:08.012
(whooping, hollering)

13:08.047 --> 13:09.447
LINDA: Teddy,
what are you doing?

13:09.481 --> 13:11.282
I'm whooping
and hollering.

13:11.316 --> 13:12.683
This is how
I used to get the turkeys

13:12.718 --> 13:13.684
to follow me on the farm.

13:13.719 --> 13:14.685
(whoops)

13:14.720 --> 13:15.887
Save yourselves.

13:15.921 --> 13:16.888
(hollers)

13:16.922 --> 13:18.289
Honor my memory, Linda!

13:18.323 --> 13:20.358
- Remember my name!
- Teddy!

13:20.392 --> 13:22.193
Don't try
to stop me, Louise.

13:22.227 --> 13:24.295
I just remembered your name,
it's Teddy!

13:24.329 --> 13:26.064
Right.

13:26.098 --> 13:28.533
I'll never forget
his incredible legs.

13:28.567 --> 13:30.535
They looked
like hotdogs.

13:30.569 --> 13:32.203
We have to get
to the front gate.

13:32.237 --> 13:33.504
Help must be
there by now.

13:33.539 --> 13:36.641
Whew! Great dancing, Bob.

13:36.675 --> 13:38.709
Time to reward myself
with some beer.

13:38.744 --> 13:41.913
Oh, hello, uh, turkey baster.

13:41.947 --> 13:43.314
How-how-how are you?

13:43.348 --> 13:44.315
Good, good.

13:44.349 --> 13:45.316
Uh, yeah, good.

13:45.350 --> 13:46.851
I-I-I'm doing really good.

13:46.885 --> 13:47.852
Yeah.

13:47.886 --> 13:49.320
That's funny, I was just, uh...

13:49.354 --> 13:52.056
I was, I was...
just talking about you.

13:52.091 --> 13:53.524
Uh, well, uh...

13:53.559 --> 13:54.892
It was good to see you.

13:54.927 --> 13:56.527
I-I should get back to...

13:56.562 --> 13:58.062
Yeah, it was...
(chuckles)

13:58.097 --> 13:59.330
It was nice to see you.

13:59.364 --> 14:00.431
You look great.

14:00.466 --> 14:01.566
(grunts)

14:01.600 --> 14:02.700
What? I-I...

14:02.734 --> 14:05.436
I-I-I see you, okay?

14:05.471 --> 14:06.604
You-You've made your point.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.007
Fine.

14:10.042 --> 14:11.008
(chuckles)

14:11.043 --> 14:12.110
Is this what you want?

14:12.144 --> 14:13.111
A-Are you happy now?

14:13.145 --> 14:14.345
Yeah, yeah? That good?

14:14.379 --> 14:16.180
Do you want it to come out?

14:16.215 --> 14:18.449
You want to do this right now?
You want to do this right now?

14:18.484 --> 14:20.885
That's a cl... that's classic.

14:20.919 --> 14:23.187
That's classic you,
turkey baster!

14:23.222 --> 14:24.555
Classic you.

14:24.590 --> 14:26.190
Not fitting in the drawer.

14:26.225 --> 14:27.692
Deliberately not!

14:27.726 --> 14:29.627
(laughs)
That's great.

14:30.829 --> 14:32.263
Oh, come on.

14:32.297 --> 14:33.931
Don't look at me like that,
turkey baster.

14:33.966 --> 14:35.199
Don't look at me like that.

14:35.234 --> 14:37.535
I... I didn't want this!

14:37.569 --> 14:39.537
You think I wanted this?!

14:39.571 --> 14:41.105
But I didn't!

14:41.140 --> 14:43.374
I didn't.

14:43.408 --> 14:45.977
This isn't what I wanted.

14:46.011 --> 14:48.880
I-I never wanted
to be apart from you.

14:48.914 --> 14:50.281
It was all an act.

14:50.315 --> 14:52.550
It was... it was a lie.

14:52.584 --> 14:53.551
(sniffles)

14:53.585 --> 14:54.952
Oh, God.

14:54.987 --> 14:56.654
That's so much snot.

14:56.688 --> 14:57.822
(sniffles)

14:57.856 --> 14:59.290
You know what?

14:59.324 --> 15:00.658
I'm gonna do it.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.660
You're right, turkey baster.

15:02.694 --> 15:03.995
I'm Bob.

15:04.029 --> 15:05.630
I make dinner.

15:05.664 --> 15:07.331
It's not too late.

15:07.366 --> 15:09.333
The grocery store's open
for another hour.

15:09.368 --> 15:11.135
We can still do this!

15:11.170 --> 15:13.738
Let's go! Let's go!

15:13.772 --> 15:15.439
Get up!

15:15.474 --> 15:18.442
Get... I can't get...
Oh, my God!

15:18.477 --> 15:20.311
I... (straining)

15:20.345 --> 15:22.413
Let's get up, drunk!

15:22.447 --> 15:23.814
I am dizzy!

15:23.849 --> 15:25.416
I'm really dizzy.

15:25.450 --> 15:26.784
Oh, my God.

15:26.818 --> 15:27.919
I gotta sit down.

15:27.953 --> 15:29.453
Give us... give us a minute.

15:29.488 --> 15:31.088
COP:
Please remain indoors.
(siren whooping)

15:31.123 --> 15:33.691
I repeat, there's been
a poultry-based disturbance.

15:33.725 --> 15:35.426
Please remain indoors.

15:35.460 --> 15:36.994
Poultry!

15:42.834 --> 15:44.202
Oh, come on!

15:45.571 --> 15:46.837
Everyone, get
behind there.

15:49.808 --> 15:51.175
(moans)
There's no one here.

15:51.210 --> 15:53.177
No one came for us.
(moans)

15:53.212 --> 15:54.512
No one even cared.

15:54.546 --> 15:55.546
(moans)

15:55.581 --> 15:56.781
We're all gonna die here.

15:56.815 --> 15:58.482
We're all gonna die.
(gibbers)

15:58.517 --> 15:59.984
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

16:00.018 --> 16:01.886
Well, I've decided
to go join the birds.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.188
I eat lots of bread already,
and I'm tired of fighting.

16:04.223 --> 16:05.456
Good-bye.

16:05.490 --> 16:07.158
I'll miss you,
but I understand.

16:07.192 --> 16:08.459
(motor rumbles)
What is that?

16:08.493 --> 16:09.694
I know that sound.

16:09.728 --> 16:10.695
Wait a minute...

16:10.729 --> 16:11.696
It can't be.

16:11.730 --> 16:12.697
It is.

16:12.731 --> 16:14.699
The old Tickle Boat.

16:16.168 --> 16:18.336
I hope you guys
aren't ticklish.

16:18.370 --> 16:20.471
Because of the boat...
Tickle Boat.

16:20.505 --> 16:22.406
Son of a bitch.

16:22.441 --> 16:23.674
I was thinking of that line
the whole way here.

16:23.709 --> 16:24.675
Pretty good, right?

16:24.710 --> 16:25.676
Pretty good.

16:25.711 --> 16:26.844
Hey, can we get in?

16:26.878 --> 16:28.079
LINDA:
We're coming, Bobby.

16:28.113 --> 16:29.747
(chickens clucking)

16:29.781 --> 16:32.216
"Went to store real quick.

16:32.251 --> 16:34.485
Love forever, Bob."

16:34.519 --> 16:35.653
That's a perfectly good note.

16:35.687 --> 16:36.921
That doesn't sound drunk at all.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.923
LINDA:
We're almost there.

16:38.957 --> 16:41.392
Hey, look-- I'm giving
those birds the bird. (laughs)

16:41.426 --> 16:43.160
Mom, Mom,
can we do it, too?

16:43.195 --> 16:44.395
Uh, yes.

16:44.429 --> 16:45.396
Just today,
'cause it's a holiday.

16:45.430 --> 16:46.397
Like this.
(grunts)

16:46.431 --> 16:47.531
(cheering)

16:47.566 --> 16:49.667
LINDA:
Up, up, higher, higher.

16:49.701 --> 16:52.003
Whoa...

16:52.037 --> 16:53.437
LOUISE:
Oh, I feel it.

16:53.472 --> 16:54.739
It's so insulting.

16:54.773 --> 16:55.906
Never do that again.

16:55.941 --> 16:58.042
(humming casually)

16:58.076 --> 16:59.543
(turkeys gobbling)

17:00.821 --> 17:02.522
This is fun, the two of us.

17:02.556 --> 17:04.190
We should go on more walks.
(horn honking)

17:04.224 --> 17:06.425
Happy Thanksgiving...
friendly guy.

17:06.460 --> 17:07.426
(man shouting)

17:07.461 --> 17:08.795
Hey, careful.

17:08.829 --> 17:11.164
I think that guy was drunk.

17:14.468 --> 17:15.935
Hello?

17:15.970 --> 17:18.438
Huh, that's weird.

17:18.472 --> 17:20.940
Okay, just gotta grab
every single thing for dinner.

17:20.974 --> 17:22.508
That's no problem.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.279
(turkeys gobbling in distance)

17:26.313 --> 17:28.248
Bye, Andy.
Bye, Ollie.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.383
Happy Thanksgiving.
Go, go, go, go, go!

17:30.417 --> 17:32.585
I'm thankful that you
saved Ollie's life.

17:32.620 --> 17:34.921
I'm thankful you
saved Andy's life.

17:34.955 --> 17:36.990
Now, get out of here!

17:37.024 --> 17:39.125
LINDA:
Bob? Bobby, we're home!

17:39.159 --> 17:40.460
We're sorry!

17:40.494 --> 17:42.061
We didn't mean
to leave you all alone

17:42.096 --> 17:43.496
- on such a big...
- TINA: Dad?

17:43.530 --> 17:45.265
If you're hiding,
that's fun.

17:45.299 --> 17:46.266
He's not hiding.

17:46.300 --> 17:47.900
Aw, giblets.

17:47.935 --> 17:49.636
We're going to get Daddy
at the store.

17:51.205 --> 17:53.072
Rudy, honey, are you
sure you don't want us

17:53.107 --> 17:54.307
to drop you
off at home?

17:54.341 --> 17:55.575
I'm going with you.

17:55.609 --> 17:57.243
I kind of want to see
how this one ends.

17:57.278 --> 17:58.244
(inhales)

17:58.279 --> 17:59.512
Oh, sweet Rudy.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.648
You probably won't
live to see the end.

18:01.682 --> 18:02.649
Oh.

18:02.683 --> 18:04.250
There you are.

18:04.285 --> 18:05.852
The one that almost got away.

18:05.886 --> 18:07.287
Hello.

18:07.321 --> 18:08.988
Oh, whoa.

18:09.023 --> 18:10.757
You're an actual turkey.

18:10.791 --> 18:12.125
That's standing there.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.259
And you have only one eye.

18:13.294 --> 18:14.627
Not that that's bad.

18:14.662 --> 18:16.763
He-he was like this
when I found him.

18:16.797 --> 18:17.997
'Cause it's a grocery store.

18:18.032 --> 18:19.165
W-What are you doing here?

18:21.969 --> 18:24.937
(whispering):
Okay, everyone follow me.

18:24.972 --> 18:27.206
(Tina moans nervously)

18:27.241 --> 18:29.542
(Bob screaming)

18:29.576 --> 18:31.978
- Dad!
- Run! Run!

18:32.012 --> 18:34.180
Oh, my God,
it's Cyclops!
(Teddy shuddering)

18:34.214 --> 18:35.982
What the hell
is happening?!

18:36.016 --> 18:38.518
We didn't do Thanksgiving right,
and we didn't listen to you,

18:38.552 --> 18:40.286
and now Thanksgiving's
attacking us!

18:40.321 --> 18:42.455
- That makes sense.
- No, it's biological!

18:42.489 --> 18:44.824
No it's the beginning
of a turkey revolution, Bob.

18:44.858 --> 18:45.958
We got to pick sides.

18:45.993 --> 18:47.193
Ow! He pecked me!

18:47.227 --> 18:48.995
Holy crap, that hurts.

18:49.029 --> 18:50.396
(nervous moaning)
Oh, God.

18:50.431 --> 18:51.664
The final "peckoning."

18:51.699 --> 18:52.665
Pecked!

18:52.700 --> 18:53.733
That's it-- pecked.

18:53.767 --> 18:55.068
I think Teddy
was right!

18:55.102 --> 18:56.469
- I was?
- And I know what to do.

18:56.503 --> 18:57.970
- You do?
- Teddy was right?!

18:58.005 --> 18:59.138
(grunts)

18:59.173 --> 19:01.240
Ow! Lin, what
are you doing?!

19:01.275 --> 19:03.142
I'm getting to the top
of the pecking order.

19:03.177 --> 19:04.477
Linda,
you're a genius.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.478
- Right?
- Ow!

19:05.512 --> 19:07.213
Damn it.
Son of a bitch.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.214
- Ow.
- Oh!

19:08.248 --> 19:09.215
Aah!

19:09.249 --> 19:11.117
(yells, grunts)

19:14.455 --> 19:17.090
Whoa, did that
actually work?

19:17.124 --> 19:18.358
Stand back, let's see.

19:19.927 --> 19:21.828
(gasps)
I'm the alpha turkey.

19:21.862 --> 19:23.262
Yeah, that's what I thought.

19:23.297 --> 19:24.263
Go stuff each other.

19:24.298 --> 19:25.765
To the Tickle Boat!

19:25.799 --> 19:27.433
Wait, the Tickle Boat
that killed that guy?

19:27.468 --> 19:28.501
Yeah.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.769
Let's go.
Go, go, go, go.

19:29.803 --> 19:31.037
- Come on, go.
- All right.

19:31.071 --> 19:32.705
Move, move, move,
out, out, go, go, go.

19:32.740 --> 19:34.941
BOB:
Well, everyone,

19:34.975 --> 19:36.509
here's to us.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.160
We've been through
so much in the last...

19:37.194 --> 19:38.561
here's to us.

19:38.595 --> 19:40.163
Wait, stop,
wait, wait.

19:40.197 --> 19:41.597
Uh-huh.
I want to say:

19:41.632 --> 19:44.767
Here is to Bob
on his favorite day.

19:44.802 --> 19:45.768
Bob! Yes!

19:45.803 --> 19:46.769
LOUISE:
Bob...!

19:46.804 --> 19:47.770
- Yay, great.
- Yes!

19:47.805 --> 19:49.505
- Thank you.
- Yes!

19:49.540 --> 19:53.176
And here's to Linda,
queen of the turkeys.

19:53.210 --> 19:54.811
She really knows
how to peck people.

19:54.845 --> 19:56.345
- Yay!
- Aw...
- Hear, hear.

19:56.380 --> 19:57.580
Queen of the Peckers.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.282
- Aw...
- Nice.

19:59.316 --> 20:00.683
And speaking of turkey--

20:00.717 --> 20:02.018
who wants some?

20:02.052 --> 20:05.154
Wait, no one wants turkey?

20:05.189 --> 20:07.023
- Not so much.
- I just don't think
it's appropriate.

20:07.057 --> 20:08.124
Probably never
ever again.

20:08.158 --> 20:09.358
I can still
smell 'em, Bob.

20:09.393 --> 20:10.493
They're inside
my mind nose.

20:10.527 --> 20:12.128
- I'll make spaghetti.
- Yeah!

20:12.162 --> 20:14.163
I can't have pasta,
but I'll eat a bowl of sauce.

20:14.198 --> 20:15.631
I'll make sauce.

20:15.666 --> 20:18.267
Fine, I'm putting on
Donna Summer, though.

20:18.302 --> 20:19.469
Who's Donna Summer?

20:19.503 --> 20:21.704
Oh, Rudy, you are
gonna love her.

20:21.738 --> 20:23.306
Mmm. Mmm.

20:23.340 --> 20:24.774
Well, Felix, should
we do the wishbone?

20:24.808 --> 20:26.008
Yes, I guess
we shou...
(clattering)

20:26.043 --> 20:27.877
- What was that?
- What was what?

20:27.911 --> 20:29.278
Come do the wishbone.
Come, come on.

20:29.313 --> 20:30.847
No, no, no.
I heard something outside.

20:30.881 --> 20:32.515
You didn't hear that?
What was that?

20:32.549 --> 20:36.018
Come... I wish you would
come do the wishbone.

20:36.053 --> 20:37.286
All right...

20:37.321 --> 20:39.155
I guess I win.
