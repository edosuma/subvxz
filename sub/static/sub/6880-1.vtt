02:13.133 --> 02:14.350
I smell fish.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.893
You might wanna take
your heels off, my darling.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.403
- Are you open?
- Yes.

02:28.732 --> 02:31.736
Great. We would love a drink

02:31.985 --> 02:32.986
Ok.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.615
What would you like?

02:37.032 --> 02:38.284
Gin for me...

02:38.492 --> 02:41.917
and a glass of white wine for my wife.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.461
Thank you.

02:46.750 --> 02:47.922
Bonjour.

02:50.462 --> 02:51.463
Beautiful view.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.761
Yes, we think so.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.806
What brings you here?

02:57.803 --> 03:00.682
Just wanted to get away from it all.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.812
This is as good a place as any.

03:04.309 --> 03:07.859
My name is Roland.
This is my wife Vanessa.

03:07.938 --> 03:11.784
I'm Michel, and the hotel manager Patrice.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.912
Pleasure to meet you.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.656
- Merci.
- Merci.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.697
What's that sound?

04:36.651 --> 04:37.868
That's the sea.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.140
I don't see a radio.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.389
I'll try to pick one up tomorrow.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.454
Morning.

06:04.155 --> 06:05.407
I was trying not to wake you.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.451
You were sleeping peacefully.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.749
I don't sleep peacefully.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.630
You know that.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.544
Are you off to find inspiration?

06:16.751 --> 06:18.469
I have my inspiration.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.843
Then why are we here?

06:21.131 --> 06:22.849
Don't be nasty, darling.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.517
If you want, I can be
back early for dinner.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.146
I need more time.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.742
You go write, I'll be fine.

06:41.568 --> 06:42.660
All right.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.627
Have a nice day.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.044
I won't.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.794
I know. Love you.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.172
I know.

08:18.581 --> 08:19.878
Fuck.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.534
How is your stay?

08:46.860 --> 08:47.861
What?

08:48.611 --> 08:49.612
You're good?

08:49.904 --> 08:51.372
Fine, yes.

08:51.990 --> 08:52.991
Thank you.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.465
Hello madam.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.794
If you want a bag, they are over there.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.575
Will that be all madam?

09:27.650 --> 09:28.697
That's it.

09:37.202 --> 09:40.832
Your total is eight francs.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.424
And an espresso.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.211
- The machine?
- The big one.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.882
The total will be...
eighteen francs please.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.439
Thirty five years?

10:03.061 --> 10:04.654
Since high school.

10:04.896 --> 10:08.025
My Father, ten years before that.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.576
Do you ever travel?

10:10.735 --> 10:12.237
No, very little.

10:13.071 --> 10:18.248
My daughter got married in Chicago,
about five years ago now.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.295
I went for the weekend, I like it here.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.338
One weekend?

10:22.413 --> 10:23.915
Yes, one weekend.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.004
And your home is nearby?

10:29.504 --> 10:30.881
Yes, around here.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.599
With your wife?

10:33.133 --> 10:35.886
My wife passed away last year.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.891
I'm sorry.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.769
She was in a lot of pain.

10:45.270 --> 10:48.740
Through her I discovered
a beautiful thing.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.734
If you really love someone.

10:52.402 --> 10:55.121
You want more for them
than you want for yourself.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.831
Do you understand?

10:58.408 --> 11:01.252
I wanted her to stay. To resist.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.621
But it was for myself.

11:03.872 --> 11:07.752
But more than that,
I wanted her to go, for her.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.678
So I was relieved when she passed away.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.426
She's found her peace.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.676
And you?

11:18.094 --> 11:20.188
I'm in pain every day.

11:20.263 --> 11:21.856
I miss her.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.142
That is life.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.561
Yes, it is.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.736
Where is your wife?

11:32.358 --> 11:33.780
At the hotel.

11:33.902 --> 11:36.155
Tired from the trip.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.454
How long have you been together?

11:40.658 --> 11:41.784
Fourteen years.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.833
You're just beginning.

11:47.457 --> 11:50.301
She seems like a lovely lady.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.179
You are very kind.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.137
She's not always lovely.

11:56.549 --> 12:00.645
In fact, she can seem downright rude.

12:00.803 --> 12:04.808
But she actually is lovely.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.486
She's very lovely.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.651
Do you want another beer?

12:14.901 --> 12:16.153
Yes.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.907
Can I buy you one?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.082
Sure but I'd rather have whiskey.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.326
Ok.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.503
Whiskey for me too.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.501
Hey.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.719
- Good day?
- Nope.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.262
Well... I don't know.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.179
I don't know.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.353
Michel's a sweet man.

12:47.350 --> 12:48.772
He's sweet.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.068
Do we have food?

12:54.399 --> 12:57.824
I walked down a ridiculous hill
and went grocery shopping.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.831
Then I read a book. It was terrible.

13:02.031 --> 13:04.534
I don't know why you worry so much.

13:04.617 --> 13:08.204
People publish pure garbage all the time,
and nobody seems to mind.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.416
I can write.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.628
I'm a good writer, remember?

13:17.046 --> 13:18.263
You are.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.225
I love your words, you know that.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.496
You should go for a walk
or something today.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.126
Might be good for you.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.342
Don't have a drink today.

15:59.417 --> 16:00.964
Might be good for you.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.384
We could be happy, you know.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.555
You resist happiness.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.850
- Don't quote some book and try to analyze...
- You don't resist happiness?

16:12.221 --> 16:14.895
Are you trying to illustrate
your point by making me unhappy?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.313
You're a good woman.

16:22.607 --> 16:23.779
Jesus.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.909
Have I become that dull?

16:32.366 --> 16:34.243
Try and write something today.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.834
Good plan, Batman.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.765
You had a tough night?

19:36.550 --> 19:37.847
I don't know.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.261
Ness?

19:47.603 --> 19:48.775
Right.

19:53.943 --> 19:56.196
Are we ever gonna talk about it?

20:00.950 --> 20:03.829
I suppose it's best we don't say a word.

20:21.804 --> 20:23.181
Ah, shit.

20:23.514 --> 20:24.982
Uh... Sorry.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.185
I got it. I got it.

20:27.727 --> 20:28.899
It's okay.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.323
Don't you want to go home now?

20:34.024 --> 20:35.367
What?

20:36.485 --> 20:38.078
What the fuck?

20:41.949 --> 20:46.921
Are you telling me when to go home?

20:47.496 --> 20:49.749
I'm trying to help you.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.545
I'm a man.

20:53.627 --> 20:54.628
Yes, yes, I know.

20:54.712 --> 20:57.056
Come on. Come on.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.517
I can walk home.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.687
I can walk home alone.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.186
I can fuck my wife myself.

21:10.019 --> 21:13.148
I don't need your fucking help.

21:18.861 --> 21:20.033
Fucking shit.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.373
Hey, I'm going. I'm going.

21:23.532 --> 21:24.624
Be nice.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.328
All right? This place is shit anyways.

21:30.915 --> 21:34.840
I don't want your life anyway.

22:18.754 --> 22:19.846
Hello.

22:23.259 --> 22:24.260
Hello.

22:28.639 --> 22:29.765
My name is Francois.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.692
Vanessa.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.526
It's a beautiful day.

22:36.856 --> 22:37.857
Hmm.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.277
Where are you from?

22:43.112 --> 22:44.159
New York.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.372
American?

22:45.447 --> 22:46.539
Hmm.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.913
We talked about having
our honeymoon in New York.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.290
Yeah, my wife and I, we...

22:52.788 --> 22:54.290
We just got married.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.009
That's nice.

22:58.878 --> 22:59.879
Hmm.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.271
Well, have a nice day.

23:09.680 --> 23:10.977
And you.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.937
How is your head?

23:52.389 --> 23:53.436
Fine.

23:57.186 --> 24:01.191
If your wife is coming,
let me know and I'll wear a tie.

24:01.482 --> 24:03.280
She'd see right through you.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.491
They always do.

24:10.741 --> 24:12.334
I am very sorry.

24:19.708 --> 24:23.554
Used to be so nice. You know...

24:24.296 --> 24:25.923
I understand.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.641
No. You can't understand.

24:32.721 --> 24:35.224
We had a life...

24:36.225 --> 24:38.523
you couldn't even imagine.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.571
Toast of New York.

24:43.857 --> 24:44.904
Hmm.

24:45.567 --> 24:46.819
I was a writer.

24:47.069 --> 24:49.117
I was a fucking writer.

24:49.613 --> 24:50.614
And she...

24:51.532 --> 24:53.284
When she took the stage...

24:53.909 --> 24:55.081
Ooh-la-la.

24:55.244 --> 24:56.791
What a body.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.089
She was happy.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.630
She was happy.

25:13.721 --> 25:15.598
In this second stage in life...

25:16.765 --> 25:18.893
Some people have children.

25:19.226 --> 25:20.352
Some people...

25:21.520 --> 25:23.147
live for each other.

25:23.439 --> 25:24.986
And some of us...

25:27.651 --> 25:29.779
not sure what we have...

25:30.529 --> 25:32.327
what we've become.

25:35.242 --> 25:37.290
Can I give you some advice?

25:38.829 --> 25:40.581
Do I have a choice?

25:42.458 --> 25:43.675
Love her.

25:46.754 --> 25:48.472
She's not so easy to love.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.258
You think you are?

25:52.301 --> 25:53.553
Hell, no.

25:53.635 --> 25:54.807
I'm an asshole.

25:56.346 --> 25:58.314
Sounds like you deserve each other.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.026
That we do.

26:37.846 --> 26:39.063
You're back early.

26:41.475 --> 26:42.943
I missed you.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.066
Don't be silly.

26:46.688 --> 26:47.860
Drink?

26:49.233 --> 26:50.485
Sure.

27:00.577 --> 27:01.703
Have you seen her?

27:02.621 --> 27:03.622
Who?

27:03.997 --> 27:05.465
The neighbor.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.634
- The couple?
- Hmm.

27:07.709 --> 27:08.835
Yeah.

27:10.379 --> 27:11.471
What?

27:14.049 --> 27:15.301
Nothing.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.393
Anyway, I was getting bored.

27:22.432 --> 27:24.855
It's not the place.
The place hasn't let me down.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.363
It's moi.

27:31.441 --> 27:33.864
Michel is such an interesting guy. He's...

27:34.945 --> 27:36.447
He's too kind.

27:37.406 --> 27:38.874
But he's heavy.

27:41.743 --> 27:44.587
Any writer worth his salt
could get a story here.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.752
It's just me.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.459
I'm blowing you a kiss.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.457
I'm blowing you one back.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.617
Since 1920.

29:42.364 --> 29:44.787
I knew it when I heard her laugh.

29:45.033 --> 29:49.038
I always loved her laugh.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.605
Oh, you never put your clothes away.

32:11.721 --> 32:13.473
We're in a hotel though.

32:55.682 --> 32:56.729
Wake up.

32:57.642 --> 32:58.894
Wake up.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.905
- Wake up!
- What?

33:03.190 --> 33:05.113
- What?
- Do you wanna fuck her?

33:06.109 --> 33:07.110
Huh?

33:07.235 --> 33:09.408
The woman next door,
do you want to fuck her?

33:10.030 --> 33:11.703
Honey, what are you doing?

33:11.781 --> 33:13.158
Don't pretend you don't know
what I'm talking about.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.710
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about. Get off!

33:16.536 --> 33:18.379
And now you just woke me up.

33:19.289 --> 33:20.586
Where are you going?

33:21.249 --> 33:23.422
I gotta take a piss. You mind?

33:44.189 --> 33:45.657
Do you want to fuck her?

33:46.399 --> 33:48.367
Jesus Christ, no.

33:51.530 --> 33:52.747
Yes, you do.

33:53.323 --> 33:55.200
Honey, why are you doing this?

33:55.283 --> 33:57.377
Why are you trying to put that in my head?

33:57.452 --> 33:59.955
Huh? So you can be the victim?

34:01.706 --> 34:03.834
Being the wife of a failed writer
is not good enough

34:03.917 --> 34:05.635
for pill-popping and self-pity?

34:05.710 --> 34:08.589
Now you need a better reason
to destroy yourself?

34:09.797 --> 34:11.471
You know my reason.

34:12.717 --> 34:16.309
Plus, you would have to try and fail
to be a failed writer, and you're nothing.

34:16.721 --> 34:17.938
You're a drunk.

34:19.933 --> 34:21.230
Fuck you.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.400
When I return, I hope
you're passed out as usual,

34:28.483 --> 34:30.827
so I don't have to
listen to your silly voice.

35:35.717 --> 35:36.718
Bonjour.

35:37.302 --> 35:38.394
Bonjour.

36:11.252 --> 36:12.925
God damn it.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.635
Come on.

37:38.715 --> 37:40.012
No.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.010
Stop it.

37:42.510 --> 37:43.762
- Stop it.
- Come on.

37:43.845 --> 37:45.017
- No.
- Come on.

37:53.521 --> 37:54.522
Ugh!

38:05.200 --> 38:06.918
Ow!

38:07.035 --> 38:08.287
Stop it.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.008
You make me sick.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.337
Disgusting.

38:22.550 --> 38:24.268
I'm not gonna make it.

38:54.707 --> 38:55.924
Good morning.

38:56.584 --> 38:57.836
Morning.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.265
Did you see your fisherman this morning?

39:03.466 --> 39:04.558
Yes.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.229
Francois is going to
visit a friend tomorrow.

39:17.897 --> 39:19.615
Do you want to do anything?

39:21.484 --> 39:22.485
With you?

39:22.569 --> 39:23.570
Yeah.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.706
Like what?

39:28.366 --> 39:32.667
I don't know. We can play cards,
go for a walk, get a drink.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.834
I don't know how to play cards.

39:38.167 --> 39:39.419
I can teach you.

39:45.008 --> 39:46.009
Okay.

39:47.135 --> 39:48.261
5:00?

39:49.929 --> 39:51.806
- 8:00.
- 8:00.

39:57.478 --> 40:00.152
Have a nice day. Bye.

40:53.576 --> 40:54.953
- Hi.
- Come in.

40:55.036 --> 40:57.004
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

41:16.557 --> 41:17.649
Pretty dress.

41:17.725 --> 41:19.227
Oh, thank you.

41:19.602 --> 41:21.400
You should put your hair up.

41:21.854 --> 41:22.946
Oh...

41:23.022 --> 41:25.445
It's funny, my...
My husband always say that.

41:26.401 --> 41:27.653
He's right.

41:30.238 --> 41:32.536
So, do you know La Belote?

41:32.615 --> 41:36.336
La Belote, the game is to get
the highest number of points.

41:36.411 --> 41:37.833
So let's say

41:39.455 --> 41:41.082
I move everything here. How many?

41:41.833 --> 41:43.585
- Um, is it?
- Yeah, yeah, you can do that.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.420
- More wine?
- Four? Damn.

41:45.503 --> 41:46.846
You won again.

41:47.213 --> 41:48.465
11.

41:49.424 --> 41:51.142
Okay. 10, king.

41:51.217 --> 41:52.514
I'll take it.

41:59.600 --> 42:00.601
Hi.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.071
- Hi.
- Belote.

42:04.147 --> 42:06.400
- Rebelote.
- Aw! Come on.

42:06.482 --> 42:08.200
So unfair.

42:09.235 --> 42:11.454
Hey. We haven't properly met.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.372
I see you at the café often.

42:13.448 --> 42:14.620
I'm Lea.

42:14.699 --> 42:16.497
- Nice to meet you. I'm Roland.
- Hi.

42:18.411 --> 42:19.879
Would you like a drink?

42:21.706 --> 42:22.798
Sure.

42:23.624 --> 42:24.876
So unfair.

42:26.210 --> 42:27.678
Do you want to join us?

42:29.213 --> 42:30.465
Okay.

42:32.008 --> 42:34.010
And don't tell me you
don't play cards, too.

42:35.386 --> 42:38.139
Your wife told me that,
and then she's won every hand.

42:38.222 --> 42:39.690
Well, she's a natural.

42:39.766 --> 42:41.484
Yeah.

42:43.811 --> 42:46.439
Oh, we can't play La Belote.

42:47.106 --> 42:48.779
It's not working if we are three.

42:49.817 --> 42:51.069
We have to change the game.

42:53.112 --> 42:54.329
Let's play...

42:55.323 --> 42:57.166
- La Bataille?
- Yes.

42:57.325 --> 42:58.622
- Mmm.
- Easy.

43:09.420 --> 43:10.888
What was that about?

43:14.634 --> 43:16.261
What do you mean?

43:21.933 --> 43:23.025
Nessa...

43:24.727 --> 43:25.899
Are you trying to push her on me?

43:27.188 --> 43:29.987
Am I wrong to think you're
trying to destroy us?

43:34.070 --> 43:35.413
I'm gonna take a shower.

43:51.796 --> 43:55.845
- Jesus! What are you doing?
- Tonight, I'm having a shower with my wife.

43:55.925 --> 43:57.552
No. No.

43:58.594 --> 43:59.720
- No.
- Enough.

44:00.221 --> 44:02.394
It's gotta stop. It's all right.

44:02.557 --> 44:04.150
- It's all right.
- No, I can't... It's just...

44:04.225 --> 44:05.943
- Vanessa, enough.
- Please.

44:06.978 --> 44:08.605
- Stop! Stop!
- No.

44:09.105 --> 44:10.823
Stop it! Stop!

44:11.440 --> 44:13.158
- Enough!
- Please.

44:13.234 --> 44:14.281
I'm your husband.

44:17.321 --> 44:18.573
I can't.

44:23.744 --> 44:26.998
At some point you're gonna stop
acting like this.

44:52.940 --> 44:54.817
Another one, please.

44:59.071 --> 45:02.701
Usually I would never ask why someone
would want gin for breakfast...

45:02.783 --> 45:04.785
but today I will make an exception.

45:07.079 --> 45:10.333
I just want to get drunk for breakfast.

45:12.960 --> 45:15.304
You don't want
buttered toast with your gin?

45:16.422 --> 45:17.514
Merci.

45:37.276 --> 45:38.949
Are we ever gonna talk about it?

45:41.155 --> 45:42.156
Nessa?

45:43.449 --> 45:45.998
Do you hate me? Do you hate me?

45:51.958 --> 45:53.380
Stop!

45:54.001 --> 45:56.003
Just stop!

45:58.547 --> 45:59.844
You resist happiness.

46:17.566 --> 46:18.988
Nessa?

46:28.452 --> 46:29.624
Ness?

48:38.791 --> 48:40.885
You're smoking a lot today.

48:49.135 --> 48:51.012
Well-earned rest.

49:33.679 --> 49:35.226
You're smiling.

49:38.976 --> 49:41.729
Now my outsides match my insides.

50:28.359 --> 50:29.485
Stay.

50:31.820 --> 50:32.946
Stay.

51:07.439 --> 51:08.531
Good morning.

51:11.068 --> 51:12.490
We were out of coffee.

51:29.003 --> 51:30.846
Why you looking at me like that?

51:33.924 --> 51:35.346
Just looking.

52:15.257 --> 52:16.554
Like this?

52:18.010 --> 52:19.728
Does that turn you on?

52:33.859 --> 52:35.532
Ah, my mother called.

52:35.944 --> 52:37.946
Really, what did she want?

52:40.157 --> 52:42.080
She wanted to know if I am pregnant yet?

52:42.159 --> 52:43.411
Well, well, well.

52:44.286 --> 52:46.584
Tell her we are working
on it day and night.

52:48.415 --> 52:52.636
And ask her if she would like
to know which positions we do it.

52:54.755 --> 52:56.098
I'll let her know.

52:56.799 --> 52:58.267
We'll see.

53:51.311 --> 53:52.312
Hello.

53:54.064 --> 53:55.236
Hello.

54:00.154 --> 54:01.576
Did you go on your trip?

54:01.864 --> 54:03.741
Your wife said you went on a trip.

54:03.824 --> 54:05.451
It was okay.

54:07.953 --> 54:09.671
But I prefer to stay here.

54:12.875 --> 54:16.466
I grew up in a place like this,
so I'm happy here.

54:16.670 --> 54:17.671
Mmm.

54:22.176 --> 54:24.224
We might have a big sailing day next week.

54:24.928 --> 54:28.023
And we don't really have
any friends up here, so...

54:29.641 --> 54:32.064
Would you and your husband
consider coming?

54:32.186 --> 54:33.358
Sailing?

54:33.479 --> 54:35.356
Yes, sailing. Why not?

54:37.649 --> 54:38.696
It can be fun.

54:40.027 --> 54:44.873
And you can do the same thing
you're doing now, only on the sea.

54:50.579 --> 54:52.172
I'll talk to my husband.

54:52.372 --> 54:53.464
Sure.

54:56.168 --> 54:57.420
Good night.

54:58.170 --> 54:59.592
Good night.

55:04.635 --> 55:06.012
- Hi.
- Hi.

55:07.554 --> 55:08.897
Thought I'd bring dinner home tonight.

55:10.307 --> 55:11.854
I'll get some plates.

55:23.654 --> 55:24.655
Nessa?

55:24.822 --> 55:26.074
Yeah?

55:27.866 --> 55:29.038
We okay?

55:33.205 --> 55:37.255
We are the same
as we've been for a long time.

55:38.377 --> 55:39.378
No different.

55:43.257 --> 55:44.258
Okay.

55:58.146 --> 56:00.274
They asked if we wanted to go sailing.

56:01.525 --> 56:02.777
How wonderful.

56:03.277 --> 56:04.494
And you said?

56:05.320 --> 56:07.698
I said we hate boats and we hate people.

56:08.991 --> 56:10.538
No, you didn't.

56:11.618 --> 56:13.495
I didn't, but we do.

56:14.371 --> 56:16.465
So we're not going, right?

56:19.793 --> 56:21.591
Do you want to go?

56:26.925 --> 56:29.098
Why do I feel like
that's a trick question?

56:30.721 --> 56:33.600
I just thought maybe
an adventure would be good for us.

56:35.267 --> 56:36.769
Maybe, I don't know.

56:39.771 --> 56:42.775
You realize how shocking
that is to hear you say that?

56:45.444 --> 56:48.197
But, yes, I would love
something fun for us.

57:47.798 --> 57:50.802
Are you sure it was a good idea
to invite them on the boat?

57:51.510 --> 57:52.807
And why?

57:56.306 --> 57:58.058
She's...

57:59.518 --> 58:01.486
I like her.

58:02.229 --> 58:06.530
She's nice but he's a bit strange, no?

58:06.775 --> 58:08.869
Strange how?

58:09.987 --> 58:14.117
I think they are both fine people
just going through something difficult.

58:17.244 --> 58:19.246
They don't spend time together.

58:20.706 --> 58:24.210
Are you worried that is going
to be us after years of marriage?

58:24.918 --> 58:25.919
No.

58:26.420 --> 58:31.096
I'm sure all will be good for them,
and for us as well.

58:36.930 --> 58:38.307
It doesn't freak you out?

58:38.390 --> 58:39.391
No.

58:40.434 --> 58:41.731
Not at all.

59:19.639 --> 59:21.391
Were you watching them?

59:22.976 --> 59:24.353
What were they doing?

59:32.444 --> 59:34.993
I ask because I was here the other day

59:35.155 --> 59:38.537
while you were on a walk,
and I noticed the hole,

59:40.327 --> 59:42.000
and I watched them

59:42.704 --> 59:44.001
fucking.

59:47.209 --> 59:49.132
Does that bother you?

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:08.943
Will you watch with me?

01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:34.004
Do you wanna take a shower?

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:40.090
Yes.

01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:05.911
Good morning.

01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:07.875
Morning.

01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:20.547
We're out of milk.

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:24.592
Will you get some when you go to work?

01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:29.143
You watch them in the morning?

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:33.359
Sometimes.

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:37.738
I think I might stay home today.

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:40.818
Is that all right? Do you wanna be alone?

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:44.737
No.

01:03:49.284 --> 01:03:50.456
Are we perverse?

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:55.924
Would it bother you if we were?

01:03:58.251 --> 01:03:59.423
No.

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:06.031
Hey, neighbor.

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:07.320
Morning.

01:05:08.696 --> 01:05:10.539
It's our two-months anniversary.

01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:15.003
I was thinking of berries and cream.

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:18.336
Maybe port? I don't know.

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:22.343
I guess it's the thought.

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:23.762
Yeah.

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:25.214
When's yours?

01:05:26.714 --> 01:05:27.931
Winter.

01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:32.221
Winter?

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:45.029
Were you with her?

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:48.745
She was at the store.
It's their anniversary.

01:05:49.821 --> 01:05:50.822
Ah.

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:55.869
When's ours?

01:05:56.828 --> 01:05:59.707
November. End of November.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:02.876
Yeah.

01:06:03.418 --> 01:06:04.715
What day?

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:07.589
27, 20...

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:11.217
Can't remember.

01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:16.222
Me neither.

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:21.732
- Ness?
- Mmm?

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:23.650
It doesn't mean anything.

01:06:25.356 --> 01:06:27.404
It doesn't mean anything
that we can't remember.

01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:30.737
Okay?

01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:34.457
They had fresh pastries.

01:07:25.667 --> 01:07:26.884
What did he want?

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:29.128
Who?

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:30.718
Francois.

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:34.638
He wanted to know
if we still wanted to go sailing.

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:37.683
You're lying.

01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:42.646
He asked me for a cigarette.

01:07:43.643 --> 01:07:47.068
I started smoking when we got here,
and you were here, so I said I was out.

01:07:49.315 --> 01:07:50.942
I know you started smoking.

01:07:51.526 --> 01:07:52.948
Did you?

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:55.659
Yeah. I know you.

01:08:06.457 --> 01:08:07.879
Two seconds.

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:30.482
Oh how sweet.

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:33.118
You think of everything.

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:37.367
I also have a little gift for you.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.372
Happy anniversary!

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:47.122
Oh, thank you.

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:03.853
It's so nice.

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:39.152
Do you see that fisherman?

01:10:42.155 --> 01:10:45.374
He goes out every day,
comes back every night.

01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:48.123
Hardly catches any fish.

01:10:51.038 --> 01:10:53.837
What keeps him from going insane?

01:10:54.375 --> 01:10:57.504
From being so tired of it all?

01:11:00.548 --> 01:11:02.550
What is it we don't know?

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:06.771
Let's go to the café for a drink.

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:10.521
Mmm... No.

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:17.069
How about we invite our neighbors?

01:11:17.148 --> 01:11:20.322
Get them liquored up, and see
what they do when they're plastered.

01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:52.483
Is it possible? She is here.

01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:54.735
We have missed you.

01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:56.854
You don't know me.

01:11:57.104 --> 01:12:01.075
No. I only know your very lonely husband.

01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:06.994
It is not easy to watch a man eat alone every
night and not start to worry and wonder.

01:12:07.406 --> 01:12:09.079
So I am very happy to see you.

01:12:10.243 --> 01:12:12.496
I am very happy to be here.

01:12:14.622 --> 01:12:16.044
What would you like?

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:20.090
- I heard pastis is good.
- Pastis. Pastis.

01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:24.925
- Hey!
- Hello.

01:12:25.216 --> 01:12:26.342
Bonsoir.

01:12:26.425 --> 01:12:27.722
Hello.

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:36.023
This is Vanessa's
first encounter with pastis.

01:12:36.227 --> 01:12:37.604
Really?

01:12:37.812 --> 01:12:40.156
- And?
- And I've had two.

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:41.616
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:12:41.774 --> 01:12:43.117
What did you think?

01:12:43.568 --> 01:12:45.946
I think you should have two.

01:12:46.153 --> 01:12:47.370
Oh.

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.782
I'm not so sure.

01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:51.789
- Just takes a little practice.
- Yeah?

01:12:51.951 --> 01:12:53.498
I have some memories.

01:12:56.163 --> 01:12:58.586
So, Roland, Vanessa
tells us you're a writer.

01:12:58.958 --> 01:13:00.585
Uh, some days.

01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:03.095
- It's great. I wish I could write.
- Mmm.

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:06.049
Well, I do, too, lately.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.473
- Hmm.
- Voilà.

01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:11.312
Oh-la-la.

01:13:12.471 --> 01:13:14.314
What do you do, Francois?

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.938
I just opened an art gallery in Paris.

01:13:17.184 --> 01:13:18.185
Mmm.

01:13:18.436 --> 01:13:19.904
- It's your own gallery?
- Yes.

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:22.198
I was a dealer first.

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:25.243
Art dealer, and then I opened a gallery.

01:13:25.818 --> 01:13:29.539
And hopefully, I have the help
of my nice little wife.

01:13:30.865 --> 01:13:32.538
So we work together.

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.918
- Cheers.
- Okay, cheers, everyone.

01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:40.958
Cheers.

01:13:43.502 --> 01:13:44.503
Mmm.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.302
- Mmm.
- That's strong.

01:13:48.633 --> 01:13:49.885
What do you do, Vanessa?

01:13:50.009 --> 01:13:51.386
Me?

01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:53.888
Absolutely nothing.

01:13:55.348 --> 01:13:56.850
You're a wife, like me.

01:13:57.850 --> 01:13:58.851
Mmm...

01:13:59.393 --> 01:14:00.519
Technically, yes.

01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:02.772
But I'm not very good at that either.

01:14:02.855 --> 01:14:04.482
That's not true.

01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:06.859
She's a fantastic wife.

01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:09.871
She's the best little homemaker
in the world.

01:14:11.739 --> 01:14:12.956
Not funny?

01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:18.250
I used to be a dancer.

01:14:18.496 --> 01:14:19.713
- Oh.
- Mmm.

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:21.545
That's great.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.007
Why did you stop?

01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:29.640
Because I got old.

01:14:33.594 --> 01:14:34.811
But very beautiful.

01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:43.904
Yes, yes.

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:46.524
I know this thing by heart.

01:14:46.607 --> 01:14:47.904
New Yorkers do not eat pigeon.

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:49.361
We eat escargot, too.

01:14:49.443 --> 01:14:50.535
I think I want another drink.

01:14:50.611 --> 01:14:52.739
- We are strange.
- You are strange.

01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:54.619
All right. Four more pastis.

01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:56.041
Yes.

01:14:56.117 --> 01:14:57.118
Cheers.

01:15:01.122 --> 01:15:03.216
Dear Lord, that was painful.

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:06.590
Let's hope it pays off.

01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:17.494
This is no fun.

01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:20.664
It's our honeymoon.

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:24.539
This is not how we make a child.

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:50.903
Well, now we know.

01:16:52.525 --> 01:16:54.118
They're miserable drunks.

01:17:39.196 --> 01:17:41.119
Isn't this just everything?

01:17:42.074 --> 01:17:43.121
My first time.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.453
Really? Well, you're a natural.

01:17:59.258 --> 01:18:01.056
Can you hold it for me?

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.749
You look beautiful laying there.

01:19:52.413 --> 01:19:53.960
Maybe I don't say that enough.

01:19:57.209 --> 01:19:59.883
It's difficult, because it
makes me wanna be with you.

01:20:00.838 --> 01:20:03.216
And I know how hard it is
for you to be with me.

01:20:06.385 --> 01:20:10.140
Only, don't begin to think he sees you
any differently than I do.

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:14.693
Of course he does.

01:20:15.519 --> 01:20:17.521
He doesn't know me.

01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:21.658
Is that what you want?

01:20:21.734 --> 01:20:23.452
To be unknown by someone?

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:28.039
Maybe.

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.039
Do you want him?

01:20:37.249 --> 01:20:38.592
Do you want her?

01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:40.590
No.

01:20:40.711 --> 01:20:42.429
But you like to watch her.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.598
I like to watch with you, honey.

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:46.516
Makes me want to be with you.

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:48.977
I think of you.

01:20:59.438 --> 01:21:01.782
I don't think I like this game anymore.

01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:08.539
Roly?

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:11.701
What are they doing?

01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:14.162
Nessa...

01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:17.338
Please?

01:21:48.654 --> 01:21:50.531
They're laying on the bed.

01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:54.664
She's reading a book.

01:21:57.037 --> 01:21:59.131
He's watching her.

01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:02.376
His hands move down her body.

01:22:03.627 --> 01:22:05.504
To her thighs.

01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:08.049
Between her legs.

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:13.012
He wants her...

01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:15.598
But he's waiting.

01:22:16.223 --> 01:22:18.476
Waiting for her
to let him know it's all right.

01:23:04.771 --> 01:23:06.899
He loves the way she feels.

01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:15.244
He wants her to know how desirable she is.

01:23:30.422 --> 01:23:33.096
And to feel how she desires him.

01:23:41.266 --> 01:23:43.268
How desirable she is.

01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:27.566
See you later.

01:24:27.813 --> 01:24:29.030
Okay.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:13.697
So he came here and bought the hotel.
We had known each other since we were kids.

01:25:14.192 --> 01:25:15.944
It was good to see him again.

01:25:16.862 --> 01:25:18.330
He is quite an oddball.

01:25:20.324 --> 01:25:22.076
He never looks back.

01:25:24.202 --> 01:25:26.705
It takes strength to do so.

01:25:28.373 --> 01:25:31.593
Most people live in the past.
I do, for example.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.507
He never looks back.

01:25:39.468 --> 01:25:41.186
Are you a believer?

01:25:44.848 --> 01:25:45.895
I am.

01:25:48.894 --> 01:25:52.194
This is the only way
I'll be with my wife again.

01:25:57.235 --> 01:25:59.203
Well, I'm going to give
Patrice another coffee.

01:26:17.047 --> 01:26:18.219
Hey.

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:19.591
Mmm.

01:26:21.093 --> 01:26:22.891
Feels strange not to talk.

01:26:24.805 --> 01:26:25.931
No, it doesn't.

01:26:31.103 --> 01:26:32.571
Are you working?

01:26:34.064 --> 01:26:35.441
No.

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:38.986
- You're writing something?
- Just drinking.

01:26:39.986 --> 01:26:41.283
I see.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:47.960
They told me who you are.

01:26:49.788 --> 01:26:50.960
I've read your books.

01:26:51.373 --> 01:26:52.625
- Have you?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:26:54.376 --> 01:26:56.504
I think I like the first one best.

01:26:58.004 --> 01:27:00.006
I guess everybody did.

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:01.887
Everyone did.

01:27:05.512 --> 01:27:08.561
Yes. Everyone has many opinions.

01:27:25.407 --> 01:27:27.034
How do you like being married?

01:27:28.869 --> 01:27:30.496
Yeah, I love it.

01:27:31.121 --> 01:27:32.418
Why?

01:27:33.123 --> 01:27:34.500
What do you mean, "Why?"

01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:36.714
Why?

01:27:41.673 --> 01:27:44.426
I like belonging to something.

01:27:45.343 --> 01:27:46.686
To someone.

01:27:47.512 --> 01:27:51.016
I like knowing what my life is gonna be.

01:27:53.477 --> 01:27:55.445
What? You think I'm naive?

01:28:01.902 --> 01:28:03.404
I think you're a woman.

01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:06.198
I think you're lovely,

01:28:07.657 --> 01:28:11.457
and I hope your life
turns out just as you imagine.

01:29:16.768 --> 01:29:18.611
Wanna go for a drive?

01:29:20.939 --> 01:29:23.909
I thought we agreed we weren't
going anywhere until you wrote.

01:29:26.444 --> 01:29:27.946
The rate I'm going...

01:29:31.533 --> 01:29:32.955
Let's go for a drive.

01:29:52.512 --> 01:29:54.640
I'd like to stop at a church.

01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:59.653
Okay.

01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:26.137
I prayed

01:30:27.213 --> 01:30:31.134
that God might forgive me for all
the horrible things I said when we knew.

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:36.606
And I prayed for the strength to mean it.

01:30:38.391 --> 01:30:39.643
Because I don't.

01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:44.315
I'm angry.

01:30:46.608 --> 01:30:48.360
I'm angry, too, baby.

01:31:11.383 --> 01:31:12.600
Where are we?

01:31:13.009 --> 01:31:15.137
I'm taking you to dinner.

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:17.722
I'm not dressed for dinner.

01:31:18.098 --> 01:31:19.645
Just do this for me.

01:31:49.295 --> 01:31:51.013
I don't want to be here.

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:53.091
It's all right, honey.

01:31:54.759 --> 01:31:56.761
Just look at me.

01:32:17.949 --> 01:32:19.041
Merci.

01:32:52.484 --> 01:32:53.701
Dance with me.

01:34:10.436 --> 01:34:14.737
Honey? Ness? Vanessa?

01:34:30.039 --> 01:34:31.791
I think I wanna write about you.

01:34:35.336 --> 01:34:36.758
I'll change the name.

01:34:39.424 --> 01:34:41.097
So what? So what if they know?

01:34:45.722 --> 01:34:47.975
Honey, I would never write about that.

01:35:21.507 --> 01:35:23.134
My love.

01:35:23.927 --> 01:35:25.804
Are we dressing up or not?

01:35:59.212 --> 01:36:01.510
I was thinking maybe I'd get dressed
and go for a walk.

01:36:01.923 --> 01:36:03.300
I'll go with you.

01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:08.013
I was gonna smoke.

01:36:09.764 --> 01:36:11.607
I won't stop you.

01:36:15.186 --> 01:36:17.029
I'll just go on the balcony.

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:03.902
Going somewhere?

01:37:04.777 --> 01:37:06.745
I'm taking Lea shopping.

01:37:07.822 --> 01:37:09.745
It's my good deed for the month.

01:37:12.452 --> 01:37:14.045
Why the sudden change of heart?

01:37:15.913 --> 01:37:17.836
I needed a pair of shoes.

01:37:51.449 --> 01:37:53.872
What are you looking for?

01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:57.372
Something... sexy.

01:37:57.455 --> 01:37:58.672
Sexy.

01:37:58.748 --> 01:38:01.376
Everything's here. Look, a lot of choices.

01:38:11.677 --> 01:38:12.974
You good?

01:38:13.137 --> 01:38:15.481
Um... Yeah.

01:38:16.974 --> 01:38:18.317
I look, um...

01:38:19.268 --> 01:38:20.770
I look different.

01:38:21.521 --> 01:38:22.818
You want to see?

01:38:23.898 --> 01:38:25.150
Yes.

01:39:12.738 --> 01:39:14.035
- Hey, Roland.
- Hi.

01:39:14.365 --> 01:39:15.787
- How are you?
- Good.

01:39:16.492 --> 01:39:17.664
That's a nice jacket.

01:39:17.743 --> 01:39:20.462
Yeah, you like it?
My missus bought it for me.

01:39:20.872 --> 01:39:22.590
I guess our girls had a bit of a spend-up.

01:39:22.665 --> 01:39:23.757
Yes.

01:39:24.208 --> 01:39:26.381
- And Lea told me about your car.
- The car is great.

01:39:26.461 --> 01:39:28.964
Yeah, that's a great car.
My uncle has the same, actually.

01:39:29.046 --> 01:39:30.389
It's nice. It's a nice car.

01:39:30.465 --> 01:39:31.466
Yeah.

01:39:31.549 --> 01:39:33.347
All right. Have a good evening.

01:39:34.218 --> 01:39:35.310
Bye.

01:40:23.184 --> 01:40:24.936
You dressed him like me.

01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:28.364
I had that jacket when we met.

01:40:30.858 --> 01:40:32.656
Did they look nice?

01:40:35.112 --> 01:40:36.159
Did they look nice?

01:40:36.239 --> 01:40:37.286
You dressed him like me.

01:40:40.159 --> 01:40:44.005
What are you doing, honey?
What are you doing?

01:40:48.626 --> 01:40:50.628
Nessa.

01:40:51.045 --> 01:40:52.968
Help me understand.

01:40:55.007 --> 01:40:57.931
What are you doing? What is this?

01:40:59.095 --> 01:41:00.347
Would you close the door?

01:41:00.429 --> 01:41:01.772
What are you doing?

01:41:02.723 --> 01:41:04.976
Would you close the door? There's a draft.

01:41:07.061 --> 01:41:08.938
What is this?

01:41:55.651 --> 01:41:58.154
I think we should stop watching them.

01:41:59.905 --> 01:42:02.328
We don't need them anymore.

01:42:03.534 --> 01:42:06.162
We have our life. We have each other.

01:42:06.245 --> 01:42:08.247
Let's let them have theirs.

01:42:10.541 --> 01:42:12.043
Honey?

01:42:13.169 --> 01:42:14.546
Ness.

01:43:12.103 --> 01:43:13.446
You're home early.

01:43:14.271 --> 01:43:15.488
Mmm-hmm.

01:43:22.613 --> 01:43:24.115
Do you want a drink?

01:43:24.907 --> 01:43:27.285
I didn't know you liked cards so much.

01:43:29.662 --> 01:43:31.005
That's nice.

01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:32.797
Cards are fun.

01:43:33.374 --> 01:43:35.502
It's a good game. I like cards.

01:43:37.253 --> 01:43:38.800
Do you want a drink?

01:43:40.798 --> 01:43:42.141
No.

01:43:42.675 --> 01:43:45.053
No, I don't want a fucking drink.

01:43:47.304 --> 01:43:49.432
I want to know what this is.

01:43:50.057 --> 01:43:53.687
- Do you wanna hurt me? Hmm?
- No.

01:43:53.811 --> 01:43:55.688
- Hurt me.
- No, I don't wanna hurt you.

01:43:55.771 --> 01:43:57.648
Just do it. Hurt me.

01:43:58.315 --> 01:43:59.658
Get it over with.

01:43:59.734 --> 01:44:00.736
- Go ahead.
- No.

01:44:00.818 --> 01:44:03.116
- I would never hurt you. Stop, please.
- It's all right.

01:44:03.988 --> 01:44:05.035
- Do it.
- Stop it.

01:44:05.156 --> 01:44:06.658
- Wanna hurt me? Get it over with.
- Stop!

01:44:07.283 --> 01:44:08.330
Go on.

01:44:08.451 --> 01:44:10.078
- I don't wanna hurt you.
- It's easy.

01:44:10.161 --> 01:44:11.708
- Just do it.
- Stop!

01:44:11.787 --> 01:44:13.084
- Come on!
- Please, stop.

01:44:13.164 --> 01:44:14.336
- Do it.
- Stop!

01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:16.758
Stop! I don't know what's happening.

01:44:16.834 --> 01:44:17.881
You don't understand?

01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:19.587
Stop! Stop.

01:44:19.670 --> 01:44:21.013
- Come on, do it.
- No! Let's just...

01:44:21.088 --> 01:44:23.682
Can we get out of here?
Can we get out of here?

01:44:24.133 --> 01:44:26.477
Could we just go? Let's just go.

01:44:27.344 --> 01:44:29.267
Let's get out of this room. Please?

01:44:31.182 --> 01:44:32.354
Please.

01:44:32.850 --> 01:44:34.193
Okay.

01:44:35.019 --> 01:44:36.521
I don't want to...

01:44:39.190 --> 01:44:40.362
I'll get my jacket.

01:45:30.991 --> 01:45:31.992
What happened?

01:45:32.076 --> 01:45:34.625
Nothing. It's Patrice, he's being funny.

01:45:34.745 --> 01:45:35.746
What did he say?

01:45:35.913 --> 01:45:37.881
I am not good at telling jokes.

01:45:38.082 --> 01:45:43.760
What will you have? I got very nice
rock lobsters this morning. Very fresh.

01:45:44.338 --> 01:45:45.965
Ok, two please.

01:45:46.215 --> 01:45:47.512
Lobsters then.

01:47:26.273 --> 01:47:27.365
May I?

01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:36.366
No. Wait!

01:47:46.335 --> 01:47:47.962
Come on.

01:47:54.593 --> 01:47:55.719
Why?

01:47:59.056 --> 01:48:00.148
Why?

01:48:00.557 --> 01:48:01.649
Why?

01:48:02.977 --> 01:48:04.069
Say it.

01:48:05.938 --> 01:48:06.985
Why?

01:48:07.731 --> 01:48:08.823
Look at me.

01:48:08.899 --> 01:48:09.991
- No!
- Look at me!

01:48:10.067 --> 01:48:11.740
- No.
- Why?

01:48:12.403 --> 01:48:13.780
Stop.

01:48:13.862 --> 01:48:16.160
You know why. Be honest.

01:48:17.574 --> 01:48:18.871
Say it.

01:48:21.245 --> 01:48:22.792
Say it. Come on.

01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:24.377
Look at me.

01:48:24.456 --> 01:48:25.548
Why?

01:48:27.167 --> 01:48:28.589
- Because you can't have what they have.
- No.

01:48:30.045 --> 01:48:31.718
Say it.

01:48:31.922 --> 01:48:34.516
- No.
- Because you can't have what they have.

01:48:35.050 --> 01:48:36.267
Because you're jealous.

01:48:36.927 --> 01:48:37.894
- No!
- You're sick!

01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:39.392
- No!
- You're sick.

01:48:41.849 --> 01:48:43.351
You would ruin them
to make yourself feel better.

01:48:43.434 --> 01:48:44.936
- You want to hurt them.
- No!

01:48:45.561 --> 01:48:46.778
- I wanted him!
- Yes.

01:48:47.563 --> 01:48:50.612
No! No!

01:48:50.858 --> 01:48:51.950
No.

01:48:54.278 --> 01:48:55.825
You're jealous because you're barren.

01:48:55.904 --> 01:48:57.747
- No.
- You hate them.

01:48:58.449 --> 01:48:59.746
You hate them.

01:48:59.825 --> 01:49:01.873
Say it!

01:49:01.952 --> 01:49:03.499
You hate them.

01:49:05.414 --> 01:49:06.757
You're jealous.

01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:12.885
You hate them because you're barren.

01:49:14.465 --> 01:49:16.138
And I've loved you anyways.

01:49:16.258 --> 01:49:17.885
You don't want him.

01:49:17.968 --> 01:49:19.390
You want me.

01:49:19.470 --> 01:49:21.017
You want children with me.

01:49:23.182 --> 01:49:25.810
You don't want him. You love me.

01:49:34.318 --> 01:49:36.241
- Say it.
- I'm barren.

01:49:38.572 --> 01:49:40.290
I'm barren.

01:50:39.842 --> 01:50:41.014
She's home.

01:51:00.404 --> 01:51:03.032
He's... He's trying to say something.

01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:08.036
Wait.

01:51:17.212 --> 01:51:19.465
He's telling her the truth.

01:51:27.222 --> 01:51:29.020
She won't let him touch her.

01:51:49.745 --> 01:51:51.372
Well done, darling.

01:51:54.374 --> 01:51:57.093
It seems you've just
destroyed a happy marriage.

01:52:52.808 --> 01:52:55.186
Could I speak with you for a moment?

01:52:57.813 --> 01:52:59.815
I don't want to speak to you.

01:53:00.524 --> 01:53:02.492
It's not what you think it is.

01:53:06.863 --> 01:53:10.288
This is something that
started three years ago,

01:53:10.534 --> 01:53:12.582
when we first tried to have a child.

01:53:14.413 --> 01:53:16.541
We lost that child in the first term,

01:53:18.041 --> 01:53:19.543
so we tried again.

01:53:21.837 --> 01:53:23.635
We lost that baby, too.

01:54:14.222 --> 01:54:17.396
They said they were going
to try and fight past it.

01:54:22.522 --> 01:54:26.243
That going through something horrible
could even make them stronger.

01:54:36.995 --> 01:54:38.622
She's pregnant.

01:54:40.248 --> 01:54:42.250
I assume you knew that.

01:54:54.805 --> 01:54:56.478
I'm not a bad person.

01:55:01.269 --> 01:55:02.896
Am I a bad person?

01:55:06.566 --> 01:55:08.193
Sometimes.

01:55:39.808 --> 01:55:43.312
We gotta stop being such assholes.

01:56:02.873 --> 01:56:04.716
I figured out your fisherman.

01:56:06.376 --> 01:56:07.969
He goes with the tide.

01:56:10.547 --> 01:56:14.017
You let it pull you out to
sea or guide you back in.

01:56:16.553 --> 01:56:18.647
Sometimes you have to move with it.

01:56:21.391 --> 01:56:23.940
Sometimes, honey, that's all we can do.

01:56:58.094 --> 01:56:59.687
Thank you for everything.

01:56:59.763 --> 01:57:00.889
Thank you.

01:57:03.683 --> 01:57:04.775
Travel safe.
