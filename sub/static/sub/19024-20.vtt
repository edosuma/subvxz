WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:03.957
Ican't believe you're bitching.

00:04.040 --> 00:07.032
I asked you to look after him
for an hour three days a week.

00:07.120 --> 00:09.031
Do you know how much
I need a massage?

00:09.120 --> 00:13.477
Are you getting all sore around
that hump where your tail used to be?

00:13.560 --> 00:17.189
When Gustave promises me something
will feel great and last an hour,

00:17.280 --> 00:20.955
he doesn't end up five minutes later,
thinking he made me see God.

00:21.040 --> 00:23.759
So not Gustave. Busy doctor.

00:23.840 --> 00:27.719
I think Dr Cox would be willing
to help if he knew it was his baby.

00:27.800 --> 00:31.509
What do you say, Stephanie? You step up
to the plate and tell the guy.

00:31.600 --> 00:36.549
I'm only three weeks old and already
I've got more stones than you do.

00:36.640 --> 00:40.474
- One of mine hasn't even dropped yet.
- It's not my place to tell.

00:44.040 --> 00:47.555
Newbie, I know that your ovaries
are absolutely tingling

00:47.640 --> 00:51.315
at the furry sight of this little
fellow, but you gotta snap out of it.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.072
I gotta get to that funeral.

00:53.160 --> 00:56.596
Raise my rent if you're not
off to see Tasty Coma Wife.

00:56.680 --> 00:58.636
Her husband was in a coma so long,

00:58.720 --> 01:01.280
she forgot what
an attractive male looked like.

01:01.360 --> 01:05.433
Enter Errol Flynn,
whose conscience will not allow him

01:05.519 --> 01:07.750
to either swash or buckle her.

01:07.840 --> 01:11.913
Since hubby is now worm food,
I'm guessing all bets are off.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.357
If you have trouble getting the baby
to sleep, just tell him that story.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.113
Well, I'm gonna get going.

01:19.200 --> 01:22.033
No one else will bust my chops
about the funeral.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.112
Around here, you tend to get
wrapped up in your own world.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.077
Whether trying to plan your day...

01:27.160 --> 01:29.958
Should I take a dookie
before or after I lift weights?

01:30.600 --> 01:31.919
Adter.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.833
...or trying to live out
your deepest fantasies...

01:35.800 --> 01:37.916
Damn it, don't you die on me.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.268
Clear.

01:41.360 --> 01:44.477
Maybe you're breaking in
your new Italian shoes...

01:44.560 --> 01:46.551
Those shoes look a little small.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.279
..or break down the spirit
of your whipping boy.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.828
What do you know
about appearances, T ed?

01:51.920 --> 01:54.798
- Have you looked in the mirror?
- Not lately.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.670
But when I do,
it's reflection perfection.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.911
One way or another,
everyone makes it all about themselves.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.797
I gotta fix my own copy machine.

02:04.880 --> 02:07.599
Maintenance man
says he has more important things.

02:07.680 --> 02:10.035
Isn't he fixing the heat
in Paediatrics?

02:10.120 --> 02:11.917
Whatever.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.198
No matter what Dr Cox thinks, I wasn't
going to that funeral to hit on Jamie.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.796
I was going to pay my respects.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.671
JD, I'm so happy you came.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.513
You look fantastic.
And, you know, I don't mean,

02:28.600 --> 02:31.831
"Hey, dude, check out
that hot biddy at the bar" fantastic.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.990
"I'm sorry for your loss" fantastic.

02:34.080 --> 02:37.436
- Do you wanna grab a drink?
- Let's get the hell outta here.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.511
I was actually talking about him.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.795
Oh, yeah, I know. So was l.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.632
No, order. He's bussing those.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.231
Somebody's a smoker.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.476
Look at my baby sleep.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.949
Isn't he an angel?

02:54.040 --> 02:57.669
I wonder what's going on
in that shiny head of his.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:21.280 --> 03:23.396
This will only hurt a little.

03:23.960 --> 03:25.871
OK.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.798
Thanks again for coming.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.189
Just get out
without doing any more damage.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.349
I had a blast.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.793
Nice job.

03:36.880 --> 03:40.236
- Goodbye.
- I'll see you.

04:23.600 --> 04:27.149
I'm sorry, everyone.
I dropped something on my toe.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.315
You know. Carry on.

04:48.840 --> 04:52.116
She's probably feeling awful
so say something reassuring.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.431
- You're going to hell.
- JD, we've been over this.

04:55.520 --> 04:59.433
I loved my husband,
but he's been dead to me for two years.

04:59.520 --> 05:03.718
I can't tell you how happy I am
to finally have some closure

05:03.800 --> 05:06.314
and my first orgasm in like, forever.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.913
You know, Jamie,

05:08.000 --> 05:10.275
there are a lot of ways to grieve.

05:10.360 --> 05:11.679
Last time I checked,

05:11.760 --> 05:13.955
wheelbarrow style wasn't one of them.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.792
I am OK, JD.

05:15.880 --> 05:19.156
- I'm seeing things clearly.
- You're confused.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.719
- I'm happy.
- You're sad.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.438
- I'm at peace.
- You're at war.

05:22.520 --> 05:25.717
I think it's really cute
that you're worried about me.

05:28.840 --> 05:30.751
But when am I gonna see you again?

05:34.120 --> 05:36.350
I will see you at home
in about an hour.

05:36.440 --> 05:39.238
Remember, keep him warm,
support his head,

05:39.320 --> 05:43.074
check his diaper every 1 5 minutes,
no bouncing around, no loud noise,

05:43.160 --> 05:45.071
no TV, no poking the soft spot,

05:45.160 --> 05:46.479
and, Perry,

05:46.560 --> 05:49.120
you're the only one
I have to say this to.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.395
Do not yell at, demean, insult,

05:51.480 --> 05:54.074
criticise, humiliate, or mock the baby.

05:54.160 --> 05:56.799
What are you talking about?

05:56.880 --> 06:00.316
- Have you named this thing yet?
- I'm naming him after my father.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.753
- Tax Evader?
- Quinn.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.115
How about a heterosexual name,
like Jack?

06:04.200 --> 06:07.510
You're right, Percival.
Quinn is a foofy name.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.592
Skip Jack altogether
and go with whatever you think.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.511
Whatever makes you comfortable.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.591
Jack, Jack, Jack...

06:17.200 --> 06:18.792
Nothing, huh?

06:22.360 --> 06:25.033
My God, this is so boring.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.234
- Turk.
- Yeah?

06:32.320 --> 06:34.993
Between my list of family and friends
and yours,

06:35.080 --> 06:38.550
we have 400 people coming to this
wedding. How can we cut this down?

06:38.640 --> 06:40.870
Whose list did I end up on,
yours or Turk's?

06:43.920 --> 06:45.353
- Mine.
- Let me see.

06:45.440 --> 06:48.398
- Nope. Gotta go.
- What's her problem?

06:48.480 --> 06:51.950
I'm wondering if
my prescription deodorant isn't working.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.110
Not for the odour, for the wetness. See?

06:54.200 --> 06:55.599
Don't touch me.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.592
I must stop touching my pits
and rubbing them on people.

06:58.680 --> 06:59.908
Yes.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.630
Still, it's not that.
I sort of had a sex dream about you.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.631
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:06.720 --> 07:10.076
- Was I the girl?
- Yeah, you were the girl.

07:10.160 --> 07:13.470
Can you just do me a favour?
Don't tell Carla about this.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.835
She'll just get all jealous
and disgusted.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.832
But we haven't done anything
for her to be disgusted by.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.990
Oh, yeah, we did.

07:21.800 --> 07:26.032
I'm gonna try not to call Jamie. I know
she shouldn't be in a relationship yet.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.156
Still there were a lot of questions.

07:28.240 --> 07:32.153
Was she going to be OK?
Did I leave my underwear at the funeral?

07:32.240 --> 07:34.470
And how did I end up
in the middle of nowhere

07:34.560 --> 07:37.950
without realising I've never
had to pee this badly in my life?

07:45.440 --> 07:47.032
Oh, my God.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.155
You saw the janitor's window crank,

07:56.240 --> 07:59.152
and think you may have seen
a little melanoma on there?

07:59.240 --> 08:02.994
Then it's your obligation as a doctor,
and your privilege as a woman,

08:03.080 --> 08:05.514
to go back and ask him
if you can't see it again.

08:05.600 --> 08:10.310
I'd love to help, but I'm baby-sitting
the only other being on God's earth

08:10.400 --> 08:15.076
who's needier than you. Now, in the
meantime, I need you to tell Mr Mueller

08:15.160 --> 08:18.357
that his liver has lesions on it
and it doesn't look good.

08:19.600 --> 08:23.832
Unfortunately, Mr Mueller
doesn't speak a word of English.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.717
Hi, Mr Mueller.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.508
Danke.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.955
- What's he danke-ing you for?
- I don't know.

08:41.039 --> 08:44.635
This is so frustrating. I wish
there was some way we could connect.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.954
Nah, that'd never work.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.870
There's my boys.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.632
Has it been an hour already?

09:20.720 --> 09:24.030
I know. Sometimes I get lost
just looking at his face.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.556
I can't do this tomorrow.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.949
Kelso's got me doing
a cardiology lecture.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.917
Don't worry about it.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.436
It's just tough to miss
precious moments like this.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.234
- Hey, baby.
- So how's it work?

09:41.320 --> 09:43.515
You get to fantasise about vanilla wafer

09:43.600 --> 09:46.273
and I get whatever "Hey, baby"
you throw my way?

09:46.360 --> 09:48.999
Forget it.

09:49.080 --> 09:52.470
- What the hell, Elliot?
- It slipped out. I'm sorry.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.916
- Sorry's not good enough.
- You're right.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.914
Harder, dammit. I've been bad.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.232
Dr Turk.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.515
- Do you have a question?
- No, sir.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.955
The Todd will close.

10:15.040 --> 10:18.396
I'm freaking out. I can't stop
having sex dreams about Elliot.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.633
All done. Continue.

10:21.720 --> 10:25.076
Every time I close my eyes,
she's doing something kinky.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.594
Very, very kinky.

10:30.120 --> 10:33.669
This is perfect. In here
I can accidentally see his wiener

10:33.760 --> 10:35.796
and then give him medical advice.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.950
Just be subtle.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.672
Can I take your order?

10:43.760 --> 10:47.673
- How come you're not unzipped?
- Cos I'm not peeing.

10:47.760 --> 10:49.716
This is where I come for my breaks.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.473
If I stand out there,
everyone tells me to do stuff.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.312
Look...

10:55.400 --> 10:57.834
...Janitor,
I'm gonna be straight with you.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.514
I saw your penis
and I noticed a possible melanoma

11:00.600 --> 11:02.158
you should have checked out.

11:02.240 --> 11:05.198
- When did you see my penis?
- When you were showering.

11:05.280 --> 11:07.430
- Where were you?
- Outside in the bushes.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.838
It was just a coincidence.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.718
If you'd looked outside
you'd have seen my penis.

11:14.800 --> 11:15.789
What? Why?

11:15.880 --> 11:18.235
Because I had it out
while I looked at yours.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.231
OK, regroup.

11:22.800 --> 11:26.076
You must be Dr Dorian.
I am Rolf's brother, Hermann.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.038
Hermann the German.
You must get that all the time.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.712
No, first time.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.468
Let's hope it catches on.

11:34.560 --> 11:37.950
Well, I could really
use your help translating.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.439
Oh, sure.

11:39.520 --> 11:42.318
I got the results back from your biopsy.

11:43.840 --> 11:50.313
The lesions in your liver are consistent
with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

11:56.360 --> 12:00.239
- What is the prognosis?
- It's not good.

12:08.320 --> 12:11.517
The key to any good relationship
is communication.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.874
Hi, baby.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.918
If you're not open with someone
it'll catch up with you.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.639
Weird. I could swear
that while I was in surgery,

12:18.720 --> 12:22.395
I heard you describe sexy dreams
about someone named Elliot.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.352
- Come on, get him.
- Up.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.670
If you're not honest,
you'll get busted.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.638
So, to summarise, if this basketball

12:31.720 --> 12:34.678
was a non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction,

12:34.760 --> 12:38.548
glyco-protein 2B-3A inhibitors
would be initiated early on.

12:38.640 --> 12:41.712
- You buying this?
- No. Can I see that?

12:43.360 --> 12:47.319
But what do I know?
Two days ago, I had funeral sex.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.073
I met your patient, Mr Mueller.
We had a nice chat.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.436
- You speak German?
- I can do a sweet little milkmaid.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.792
I can do an evil old hausfrau.

13:02.480 --> 13:05.199
German's such a beautiful language.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.430
I think Mr Mueller's so amazing.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.193
Yesterday I pretty much told him
he was gonna die.

13:10.280 --> 13:13.078
And his brother turned to him
and he said...

13:15.440 --> 13:18.318
- Mr Mueller just accepted it.
- Why wouldn't he?

13:19.480 --> 13:21.835
...means, you're gonna be fine.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.833
Germans.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.669
Tell me he said, "My brother told me
the truth, I'm dealing with it."

13:40.760 --> 13:43.672
He said, "When I get home,
I'm eating a chocolate cake."

13:43.760 --> 13:46.558
Why did you lie
to your brother about his condition?

13:46.640 --> 13:48.039
You talk too fast.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.151
He didn't want to upset his brother.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.754
Lying isn't gonna make his brother
any better.

13:57.840 --> 14:00.513
We got Mr Mueller's ultrasound back.

14:00.600 --> 14:03.512
His biliary obstruction's relieved,
he's taking PO.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.874
That's good, yes?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.878
I need you to crunch the numbers
on next year's budget.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.520
That's a job
for the accounting department.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.033
I'm an attorney.

14:15.120 --> 14:19.716
Speaking of crunching, I'm jonesing
for some Double Stuff Oreos all day.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.631
See if you can't hook me up.

14:21.720 --> 14:25.793
Now Mr Mueller is doing so much better,
I'm not sure if telling him the truth

14:25.880 --> 14:27.598
is even the best thing for him.

14:27.680 --> 14:29.910
What you're saying is
you have a problem

14:30.000 --> 14:33.675
that is totally your problem,
but you'd like to make it my problem?

14:33.760 --> 14:36.638
But, here's the problem, Newbie,
it's not my problem.

14:36.720 --> 14:39.280
So let's stop talking
about the janitor's junk?

14:39.360 --> 14:43.558
I'd like to hear nussing about ze German
and don't even mention Tasty Coma Wife,

14:43.640 --> 14:45.358
even though she's on your mind.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.431
- No, she's not.
- Yes, I am.

14:48.880 --> 14:51.474
Since we are sharing,
I have to go and face Jordan

14:51.560 --> 14:55.109
and tell her I didn't ditch
her hatchling on account of being lazy.

14:55.200 --> 14:59.034
Whenever I'm alone with that child,
you know what I feel?

14:59.120 --> 15:01.236
Nothing.

15:01.320 --> 15:05.393
What do you say, you wanna trade
your big problems for mine?

15:05.480 --> 15:08.438
- No, thanks.
- It was worth a try.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.950
What was that about?

15:12.040 --> 15:13.712
You're right, I'm sorry.

15:13.800 --> 15:18.396
I've been working really hard
on not being such a busybody.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.391
So tell me, was she a good kisser?

15:20.480 --> 15:21.993
Excuse me.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.314
If you're having dreams
about another woman,

15:26.400 --> 15:29.278
maybe you're not ready for marriage.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.351
- Baby.
- Just take it.

15:32.960 --> 15:38.273
Are you crazy? Baby, it was only
a sex dream. Everybody has them.

15:38.360 --> 15:41.477
- Right, Ted?
- No, not me.

15:41.560 --> 15:45.109
I just have the one dream
over and over.

15:45.200 --> 15:50.832
I hold his head under the water
till the last bubble goes bloop.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.149
Ted.

15:53.240 --> 15:56.312
What's the ETA
on those Double Stuffs?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.718
Bloop.

16:03.560 --> 16:06.154
OK, I still wanna refer you
to a dermatologist,

16:06.240 --> 16:08.708
but it looks benign to me.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.268
Benign, benign-and-a-half.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.669
Then he said something
I didn't expect.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.797
- I don't like you.
- Not that. I expected that.

16:16.880 --> 16:23.115
I know this was uncomfortable
and I appreciate your concern.

16:23.200 --> 16:26.476
I'm a doctor. I had to tell you
what was going on.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.551
Don't touch me with those hands.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.268
- This is awkward.
- Elliot.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.157
Could you be quiet, please?

16:34.240 --> 16:36.151
OK, but you could just fall asleep

16:36.240 --> 16:39.277
then I might just creep into your head
and rock your world.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.430
Elliot, you don't get it, do you?

16:41.520 --> 16:44.830
Since I met Carla,
I haven't dreamt about another woman.

16:44.920 --> 16:48.230
Turk, you're engaged.
I mean, it's a huge commitment.

16:48.320 --> 16:53.713
It's totally natural to feel trapped, or
uncertain, maybe even a little scared.

16:53.800 --> 16:54.789
Really?

16:57.480 --> 16:59.118
Sorry.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.072
- Baby?
- Yeah.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.627
Have you dreamt of anyone
since we got engaged?

17:04.720 --> 17:08.190
No, baby, but I understand.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.999
Come here. Let me give you
something to dream about.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.954
See if you can find my tattoo.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.912
- Hey, Jordan.
- You know, it's funny.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.675
I can't even be pissed
and want you to die screaming in agony

17:30.760 --> 17:34.230
as horses pull you apart
when I'm looking at this beautiful face.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.870
Jordan, I gotta tell you something.

17:37.960 --> 17:41.748
You know, I love my dad,
but he just doesn't look like a Quinn.

17:41.840 --> 17:44.752
Maybe cos he's not drunk
and yelling at your mother.

17:45.920 --> 17:49.037
What are you? A Kevin? A Billy?

17:50.200 --> 17:51.474
Jack?

17:53.280 --> 17:56.397
All right. Jack it is.

17:56.480 --> 17:59.233
What the hell.
All right. You take him.

18:04.320 --> 18:08.029
- What did you wanna tell me?
- Nothing.

18:21.320 --> 18:23.356
He wants to know
why his brother lied.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.908
I guess he was trying to protect you.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.993
Or he thought he was protecting you,
but he was really protecting himself.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.674
I forget what protect is.
You used it five times.

18:38.520 --> 18:40.511
Just like my brother.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.155
Always thinks he knows
what's best for me.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.554
It's funny how one person
leads you to another.

18:48.640 --> 18:51.632
I knew Mr Mueller's brother
shouldn't try to protect him

18:51.720 --> 18:54.792
and yet I was doing
the same thing to someone else.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.235
- Excuse me. Jamie.
- JD?

18:57.320 --> 19:00.915
A patient was mad at his brother
for presuming to know what was best,

19:01.000 --> 19:02.399
and that got me thinking.

19:02.480 --> 19:05.358
I was freaking out that we hooked up
at the funeral.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.556
I did the same thing to you.

19:07.640 --> 19:10.473
If you're really ready, let's go for it.

19:10.560 --> 19:13.552
I'm crazy about you.
You're right, your husband's gone,

19:13.640 --> 19:15.358
and he's never coming back.

19:17.280 --> 19:21.432
- Who are these lovely people?
- These are my late husband's parents.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.954
Oh, God, how can I make this right?

19:36.400 --> 19:38.118
If only.
