00:54.526 --> 00:57.942
Remember when they let
commercial airlines land in this town?

00:58.029 --> 01:00.271
I don't understand where we're going...

01:00.365 --> 01:02.523
...or why we're bothering anyhow.

01:02.701 --> 01:05.737
-You're doing a good deed.
-Give us a better reason.

01:06.163 --> 01:09.994
A maniac hijacked a municipal bus
with 30 passengers on it.

01:10.458 --> 01:13.958
I got a hunch where those passengers are
and who that maniac is.

01:14.045 --> 01:15.456
Share it with us.

01:16.089 --> 01:17.120
Phoenix.

01:17.716 --> 01:18.961
Simon Phoenix.

01:56.212 --> 01:58.252
Send a maniac to catch one.

02:00.591 --> 02:01.587
Phoenix!

03:14.248 --> 03:15.991
Don't move, Phoenix.

03:19.586 --> 03:21.128
You're under arrest.

03:21.797 --> 03:23.339
Arrest? Shit.

03:24.132 --> 03:25.840
And you're trespassing.

03:27.177 --> 03:28.588
Where are the passengers?

03:28.678 --> 03:30.718
Oh, yes, the passengers.

03:30.889 --> 03:32.431
Well, they're....

03:33.517 --> 03:34.762
Fuck you.

03:34.851 --> 03:36.725
The passengers are gone.

03:37.187 --> 03:40.686
See, I told the city,
"Look, nobody comes down here."

03:41.316 --> 03:43.024
Postmen figured it out...

03:43.193 --> 03:44.770
...policemen figured it out.

03:44.861 --> 03:48.147
But the goddamn bus drivers
just wouldn't listen.

03:48.782 --> 03:50.573
Last time, Phoenix.

03:50.951 --> 03:52.943
Where are the hostages?

03:53.078 --> 03:56.328
To hell with the hostages!.
This is between you and me!.

04:01.211 --> 04:02.290
What you got?

04:02.378 --> 04:03.458
Do something.

04:03.546 --> 04:04.827
Go ahead.

04:05.799 --> 04:07.957
You're up to your ass in gasoline.

04:11.346 --> 04:13.219
I'll set your ass on fire.

04:26.361 --> 04:27.938
Is it cold in here...

04:28.696 --> 04:30.238
...or is it just me?

05:02.480 --> 05:03.938
Where are they, Phoenix?

05:04.023 --> 05:05.766
Now, where did I put them?

05:06.066 --> 05:09.317
I swear, I'd lose my head
if it wasn't attached.

05:10.654 --> 05:12.647
I'll keep that in mind.

05:54.197 --> 05:57.364
Damn it, I'm tired
of this "demolition-man" shit!

05:57.826 --> 06:00.068
You were not supposed
to come down here!

06:00.162 --> 06:03.744
You were not supposed to attempt
the arrest of Phoenix alone...

06:03.999 --> 06:05.493
...or to blow anything up!

06:05.584 --> 06:08.750
It wasn't me! He dumped the gas
and rigged the place to blow!

06:08.837 --> 06:10.497
Right, you weren't involved.

06:10.589 --> 06:13.210
I know you've tried
to nail this psycho for years.

06:13.300 --> 06:15.257
But remember a thing called...

06:15.427 --> 06:17.170
...official police procedure?

06:17.262 --> 06:19.219
-Where are the hostages?
-They're not here.

06:19.306 --> 06:20.005
What?

06:20.098 --> 06:22.007
He must've stashed them someplace else!

06:22.100 --> 06:23.974
Are you sure they weren't in there?

06:24.060 --> 06:27.595
I did a thermo check and there were eight
of them, all part of his gang.

06:27.689 --> 06:28.851
Wrong again!

06:29.024 --> 06:30.767
You got something to say?

06:31.693 --> 06:33.235
Get him out of here!

06:34.028 --> 06:35.060
Motherfucker!

06:35.155 --> 06:37.396
We are going to have a chat.

06:38.283 --> 06:39.278
Captain!

06:40.285 --> 06:42.740
Over here! There're bodies everywhere!

06:42.871 --> 06:44.413
There must be 20 or 30.

06:44.497 --> 06:45.991
They're everywhere.

06:47.375 --> 06:48.786
See that? I told him!

06:48.876 --> 06:50.703
He said he didn't care!

06:51.004 --> 06:54.752
How could you sacrifice
all those innocent people for me!

06:55.508 --> 06:57.299
What kind of man are you?

06:57.385 --> 07:00.718
We'll spend a lot of quality time together.
'Bye, sweetie!

07:00.805 --> 07:02.347
Honey! Sugar!

07:03.391 --> 07:05.716
If you got a lawyer, better call him.

08:02.074 --> 08:05.657
John Spartan, you've done great deeds
for Los Angeles.

08:06.120 --> 08:09.370
So, it is with some regret that l,
William Smithers...

08:09.498 --> 08:13.033
...acting as Assistant Warden,
hereby carry out this sentence.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.574
Skip it.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.787
You've been sentenced to 70 years...

08:17.881 --> 08:22.128
...sub-zero re-habilitation
in the California Cryo-Penitentiary...

08:22.427 --> 08:25.796
...for the involuntary manslaughter
of 30 civilians.

08:26.181 --> 08:27.344
Skip it.

08:27.474 --> 08:30.890
You'll be placed in cryo-stasis
for the duration of your sentence...

08:30.977 --> 08:34.511
...and your behavior will be altered
through synaptic suggestion.

08:34.606 --> 08:38.057
You'll be eligible for parole
no earlier than the year 2046.

08:46.993 --> 08:48.108
I'm sorry.

11:50.925 --> 11:52.254
All personnel...

11:52.343 --> 11:55.961
...the next scheduled parole hearing
for prisoner Gilmour...

11:56.097 --> 11:58.137
...will take place at 07:. 15.

11:59.434 --> 12:03.266
Warden William Smithers
report to Level A, conference room.

12:09.610 --> 12:11.021
Mellow greetings.

12:11.696 --> 12:14.234
Be well, Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.

12:15.116 --> 12:16.943
As it is a beautiful...

12:17.118 --> 12:20.818
...Monday morning and as my duty log
irrationally requires it...

12:20.997 --> 12:23.666
...I'm querying you
on the prison population.

12:23.749 --> 12:25.493
Does the tedium continue?

12:25.626 --> 12:28.331
Your question is amusing but irrelevant.

12:28.462 --> 12:31.132
The prisoners are ice cubes.
They never move.

12:31.841 --> 12:34.925
I find this lack of stimulus
to be truly disappointing.

12:35.011 --> 12:36.754
-Don't you think?
-I try not to.

12:36.846 --> 12:39.171
You're young, think all you want.

12:39.348 --> 12:42.384
Things don't happen anymore,
we've taken care of all that.

12:42.476 --> 12:45.311
I'll fiber-op you back
after the parole hearings.

12:45.396 --> 12:46.973
Have a peachy day.

12:47.148 --> 12:48.179
Be well.

12:48.357 --> 12:49.222
Be well.

12:49.316 --> 12:50.727
Vector 137.

12:50.818 --> 12:53.309
Upcoming, Santa Monica Boulevard.

12:58.534 --> 13:00.242
Retina coding accepted.

13:00.411 --> 13:02.487
Warden Smithers, be well.

13:02.913 --> 13:03.992
Go on.

13:12.089 --> 13:13.168
Self-drive on.

13:13.257 --> 13:15.048
Self-drive engaged.

13:15.425 --> 13:16.801
Coding on.

13:17.094 --> 13:20.842
No police presence is requested
in the city at this time.

13:21.014 --> 13:22.177
Report to the station.

13:22.266 --> 13:24.175
Oh, boy, how exciting.

13:59.928 --> 14:00.924
That's it.

14:01.012 --> 14:02.839
"Food, glorious food. "

14:03.556 --> 14:04.967
There'll be another in 12 hours.

14:05.058 --> 14:07.430
These assholes are predictable.

14:07.811 --> 14:09.353
God, I hate this place!

14:09.437 --> 14:11.097
There's not enough of us, Friendly.

14:11.189 --> 14:13.182
That doesn't really matter anymore.

14:13.274 --> 14:14.650
People are hungry.

14:14.734 --> 14:16.643
We've nothing to lose.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.828
Greetings.

14:32.001 --> 14:33.543
Lovely Lenina.

14:35.463 --> 14:38.962
Greetings, welcome
to the emergency line of the SAPD.

14:39.842 --> 14:42.843
If you prefer an automated response,
press one now.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.293
Be well.

14:47.683 --> 14:49.676
Mellow greetings, Lenina Huxley.

14:49.769 --> 14:51.761
Let me guess, all is serene?

14:51.979 --> 14:54.766
On the contrary, it's been a horrific a.m.

14:55.191 --> 14:57.349
Public buildings were defaced.

14:57.526 --> 14:59.400
Walls smudged with...

14:59.862 --> 15:01.522
...scandalous graffiti.

15:01.614 --> 15:02.693
Really?

15:02.865 --> 15:05.819
Brutal. Why wasn't there
an "all-cars notify"?

15:06.035 --> 15:09.534
Because there was no need
to create widespread panic.

15:10.623 --> 15:12.366
Lieutenant Huxley...

15:12.541 --> 15:15.542
...I monitored your disheartening
and distressing comments...

15:15.628 --> 15:17.537
...to the warden this morning.

15:17.630 --> 15:20.631
Do you really long for chaos
and disharmony?

15:21.509 --> 15:25.257
Your fascination with the 20th century
is affecting your judgment.

15:26.222 --> 15:30.136
You realize you're setting a bad example
for other officers and personnel.

15:30.225 --> 15:32.895
Thank you for the attitude readjustment.

15:33.062 --> 15:34.770
Info assimilated.

15:42.571 --> 15:44.231
Sanctimonious asshole.

15:44.406 --> 15:47.075
Lenina Huxley, you are fined 1/2 credit...

15:47.159 --> 15:50.243
...for a 'sotto voce' violation
of the verbal-morality statute.

15:50.329 --> 15:51.704
Thank you.

15:58.754 --> 16:00.082
That was tense.

16:00.422 --> 16:02.000
That was tense?

16:04.092 --> 16:08.422
Don't you get bored code tracing perps
who break curfew and tell dirty jokes?

16:08.889 --> 16:10.965
I find my job deeply fulfilling.

16:11.767 --> 16:15.432
I just can't get over the reality
of this office, Lenina.

16:15.937 --> 16:18.393
You're still addicted to the 20th century.

16:18.482 --> 16:21.767
High from its harshness.
Buzzed by its brutality.

16:22.194 --> 16:23.652
Holy smokes!

16:24.279 --> 16:28.526
Is there anything in this office which
doesn't violate Contraband Ordinance 22?

16:28.617 --> 16:29.945
Only you.

16:31.578 --> 16:34.069
Don't you ever want something to happen?

16:35.290 --> 16:36.570
Goodness, no.

16:37.375 --> 16:39.119
I knew you'd say that.

16:41.963 --> 16:44.121
What I wouldn't give for some action.

16:54.934 --> 16:56.678
Mr. Simon Phoenix.

16:57.896 --> 17:00.600
One of our first
and most illustrious members.

17:01.983 --> 17:03.146
Allow me...

17:03.276 --> 17:06.146
...to welcome you to your parole hearing.

17:06.529 --> 17:08.438
Let's get this over quickly.

17:11.451 --> 17:15.282
Twenty-nine years ago,
the parole system, as you know it...

17:17.290 --> 17:19.366
...was rendered obsolete.

17:21.294 --> 17:23.416
Federal Statute 537-29....

17:27.800 --> 17:28.831
Stop it!

17:32.430 --> 17:35.300
Do you have anything fresh to say
on your behalf?

17:38.978 --> 17:40.306
I thought not.

17:43.065 --> 17:43.979
Yeah.

17:44.191 --> 17:45.354
I do.

17:46.318 --> 17:47.481
Teddy bear.

18:05.254 --> 18:07.163
How'd you know the password?

18:07.423 --> 18:08.917
I wish I knew.

18:09.008 --> 18:10.668
Simon says:. die.

18:29.194 --> 18:30.357
Warden...

18:31.029 --> 18:33.069

19:03.144 --> 19:04.389

19:06.231 --> 19:07.974
I don't believe it!

19:08.316 --> 19:10.392
Northwest quadrant. 187.

19:12.070 --> 19:13.564
What's a 1 87?

-Who?

20:53.587 --> 20:55.129
Simon Phoenix.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.634
I knew him.

20:59.718 --> 21:02.672
He's evil in a way you've never read about.

21:02.971 --> 21:06.174
He's a criminal the likes
of which you've never seen.

21:06.350 --> 21:08.093

...before they started lo-jacking everybody.

21:27.579 --> 21:30.663
Declared his own kingdom

-...he was the worst.
-Emergency, code 187.

21:35.879 --> 21:37.706
Emergency, code 187.

21:39.716 --> 21:41.340
Locating stopped code.

21:41.551 --> 21:43.959
MurderDeathKill. MurderDeathKill.

21:44.846 --> 21:45.842
Location...

21:45.930 --> 21:49.513
...Cryo-prison, parking area.
Cryo-prison, Level 6....

21:51.060 --> 21:53.053
Main cryo-prison parking zone.

21:53.188 --> 21:54.812
Enhancing image.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.939
Tracking Dr. Mostow.

21:57.275 --> 21:58.817
187, deceased.

22:00.695 --> 22:02.901
Do you wish to assign a coroner?

22:04.574 --> 22:06.566
Is the doctor's car still in the lot?

22:06.659 --> 22:09.031
The answer is no. Car missing.

22:10.872 --> 22:14.739
Doctor's conveyance is not
in parking zone. It is in motion.

22:17.086 --> 22:19.660
Locate precise code-fix
on doctor's conveyance.

22:19.756 --> 22:22.163
Fixing location. Beverly Hills.

22:22.467 --> 22:23.665
Robertson.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.088
Doheny.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.887
Beverly Drive.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.756
Vehicle has been code-fixed...

22:31.017 --> 22:35.014
...approaching the corner of Wilshire
and Santa Monica Boulevard.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.183
Glorious.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.734
Fine work.

22:40.985 --> 22:43.310
All nearby units, ProtectServe...

22:43.529 --> 22:45.687
...Wilshire and Santa Monica.

22:46.157 --> 22:48.861
-Unit 1 2 ProtectServe.
-Apprehend fugitive.

22:48.993 --> 22:51.032
Proceed with extreme assertiveness.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.611
Doctor's vehicle has been code-fixed.

22:53.706 --> 22:57.703
Approaching the corner of Wilshire
and Santa Monica Boulevard.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.814
Lately I just don't feel like
there's anything special about me.

23:20.899 --> 23:23.473
You are an incredibly sensitive man...

23:23.610 --> 23:27.359
...who inspires joy-joy feelings
in all those around you.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.322
-Get out of here!
-Excuse me.

23:32.202 --> 23:33.578
I'm sorry.

23:35.455 --> 23:38.955
Greetings, Citizen! How are you feeling
on this glorious day?

23:41.461 --> 23:43.335
You look great today!

23:46.466 --> 23:48.126
I feel good too.

23:48.510 --> 23:51.677
Angeles Information Network.
Automated banking.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.591
Damn, I'm possessed.

23:54.766 --> 23:57.257
I wonder if I can play the accordion too.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.061
File code accepted.

24:00.939 --> 24:03.347
Friendly, Edgar. Code level 60.

24:03.859 --> 24:06.350
Listed offenses: civil unrest....

24:06.444 --> 24:10.228
Don't you hear a thought repeating
in that brain of yours?

24:10.782 --> 24:12.858
The name Friendly, Edgar?

24:12.993 --> 24:14.570
Edgar Friendly.

24:15.787 --> 24:17.945
Don't you have a job to do?

24:18.289 --> 24:20.448
Don't you have someone to kill?

24:21.710 --> 24:23.369
Someone to kill.

24:23.878 --> 24:25.538
Someone to kill.

24:40.728 --> 24:43.100
"Gun, " noun. Portable firearm.

24:43.898 --> 24:48.560
This device was widely utilized
in the urban wars of the late 20th century.

24:48.736 --> 24:50.528
Referred to as a "pistol. "

24:50.613 --> 24:54.397
I don't need a history lesson.
Where are the goddamn guns?

24:55.618 --> 25:00.161
You are fined one credit for a violation
of the verbal-morality statute.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.576
Fuck you.

25:02.416 --> 25:06.248
Your repeated violation
has caused me to notify the police.

25:08.172 --> 25:10.841
Please remain where you are
for your reprimand.

25:10.925 --> 25:12.384
Yeah, right.

25:17.515 --> 25:19.258
The fuckers are fast too.

25:19.350 --> 25:23.597
You are fined one credit for violation
of the verbal-morality statute.

25:24.688 --> 25:26.598
ProtectServe in place.

25:26.774 --> 25:29.016
Four minutes, fifteen seconds lapse.

25:31.070 --> 25:33.608
Maniac is imminent. Request advice.

25:33.864 --> 25:35.442
With a firm tone of voice...

25:35.533 --> 25:38.818
...demand maniac lie down
with hands behind back.

25:41.789 --> 25:43.331
Simon Phoenix!

25:43.791 --> 25:46.708
Lie down with your hands
behind your back!

25:47.753 --> 25:48.951
What's this?

25:49.129 --> 25:51.501
Six of you. Such nice, tidy uniforms.

25:52.299 --> 25:54.042
Oh, I'm so scared.

25:55.886 --> 25:58.294
You guys don't have sarcasm any more?

26:00.057 --> 26:02.049
Maniac responded scornfully.

26:02.643 --> 26:06.640
Approach and repeat ultimatum
in an even firmer tone of voice.

26:06.980 --> 26:09.056
Add the words: "or else. "

26:12.110 --> 26:14.186
Lie down on the ground...

26:15.072 --> 26:16.482
...or else!

26:27.834 --> 26:30.041
Anti-Graffiti Activation Program...

26:30.170 --> 26:31.285
...activated.

26:31.379 --> 26:32.375
Aborted.

26:32.464 --> 26:34.503
Human presence detected.

26:35.091 --> 26:37.417
Safety override code accepted.

26:37.844 --> 26:39.422
Lucky number seven.

26:56.571 --> 26:57.946
We're police officers!

26:58.031 --> 27:00.948
We're not trained to handle this kind
of violence!

27:08.374 --> 27:09.703
Wait for me!

27:32.148 --> 27:33.346
Stupid.

27:47.121 --> 27:49.279
Simon says: everybody sing!

27:51.792 --> 27:53.286
"And the home

27:54.128 --> 27:55.670
"Of the brave "

27:57.757 --> 27:59.132
Play ball!

28:07.224 --> 28:09.632
We've lost every camera for six blocks.

28:11.645 --> 28:14.101
Go to Century City, 1200 millimeters.

28:22.239 --> 28:24.812
He's going for the vehicle's battery coil.

28:25.451 --> 28:27.242
It's pure capacitance gel.

28:37.462 --> 28:40.499
The problem is not the defacement
of public buildings or...

28:40.591 --> 28:44.090
...the noise pollution caused
by the exploding devices.

28:44.219 --> 28:45.844
Allow me to explain.

28:46.430 --> 28:49.466
The real problem lies
in the man whose initials...

28:49.725 --> 28:51.966
...mark the detonating graffiti...

28:52.436 --> 28:54.927
...on the streets of our peaceful city.

28:55.313 --> 28:57.271
The man behind the "E.F."...

28:58.358 --> 29:00.066
...Mr. Edgar Friendly.

29:02.112 --> 29:04.603
For a sadly extended period of time...

29:04.948 --> 29:06.691
...we in San Angeles...

29:06.783 --> 29:10.152
...have been plagued by a pack
of subterranean hooligans.

29:11.663 --> 29:14.154
You will come to know them as "scraps."

29:14.291 --> 29:18.039
Men and women who have left the comfort
of our society...

29:18.295 --> 29:20.038
...only to spew hostility...

29:20.130 --> 29:23.131
...at the very bosom
they have relinquished.

29:23.425 --> 29:27.007
There was a time when we used
to look upon these scraps...

29:27.178 --> 29:30.013
...as rather pathetic
and relatively harmless.

29:31.015 --> 29:32.759
Now they have a leader.

29:33.184 --> 29:36.102
Mr. Friendly seems relentless
in his ambition...

29:36.187 --> 29:39.058
...to infect our harmony with his venom.

29:39.691 --> 29:41.434
He must, of course...

29:41.651 --> 29:43.026
...be stopped.

29:43.820 --> 29:47.153
This radical terrorist behavior,
led by Mr. Friendly...

29:47.240 --> 29:50.110
...must not be allowed
to undermine our safety.

29:52.829 --> 29:54.323
"Safety Above All."

29:55.373 --> 29:58.160
I expect your trust,
confidence and certitude.

29:59.502 --> 30:00.700
Excuse me.

30:04.006 --> 30:05.251
Dr. Cocteau...

30:05.424 --> 30:09.208
...a cryo-con has effected self-release
from the penitentiary.

30:09.720 --> 30:13.848
It's quite horrific. MurderDeathKills,
all categories of chaos.

30:14.058 --> 30:15.517
Enhance your calm.

30:20.147 --> 30:21.807
"Be well" them for me.

30:26.737 --> 30:29.524
Get me Captain George Earle immediately.

30:31.742 --> 30:33.153
It was just....

30:34.578 --> 30:35.823
It was so....

30:37.414 --> 30:39.822
How can a man be so blatantly sadistic?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.744
It was fun for him.

30:42.253 --> 30:46.250
Do everything in your power
to snare this agent of destruction.

30:46.423 --> 30:48.499
You have my utmost confidence.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.717
It will be done, Dr. Cocteau.

30:53.263 --> 30:54.259
Be well.

30:59.103 --> 31:00.929
"Utmost confidence."

31:02.272 --> 31:04.182
"Everything in our power."

31:08.195 --> 31:09.689
What else is there?

31:11.114 --> 31:12.573
Zachary Lamb...

31:13.075 --> 31:17.024
...how was the fiendish Phoenix
apprehended back in the 20th?

31:17.788 --> 31:19.661
Twelve-state manhunt.

31:19.998 --> 31:21.991
Satellite surveillance.

31:22.626 --> 31:25.199
A video bite on Unsolved Mysteries.

31:26.046 --> 31:27.873
None of them worked.

31:28.423 --> 31:30.630
In the end, it took just one man.

31:30.801 --> 31:32.081
One cop.

31:33.053 --> 31:34.547
John Spartan.

31:35.097 --> 31:36.176
John Spartan?

31:36.264 --> 31:37.723
That's right.

31:37.933 --> 31:40.424
They called him the "Demolition Man."

31:40.894 --> 31:42.970
Spartan file 98345, LAPD.

31:45.774 --> 31:47.897
Spartan file 98761C, LAPD.

31:52.739 --> 31:55.064
Are you sure this is real life?

31:55.241 --> 31:56.486
Barely.

31:56.743 --> 31:58.023
Spartan's a legend.

31:58.119 --> 32:02.283
I've been doing a historical study.
Over 1,000 arrests over three years.

32:02.457 --> 32:04.496
All authentic criminals.

32:04.834 --> 32:07.123
There was a lot more business back then.

32:07.212 --> 32:10.331
How can you justify
destroying a $7 million mini mall...

32:10.423 --> 32:13.258
...to rescue a girl
whose ransom is only $25,000?

32:13.343 --> 32:14.753
Fuck you, lady.

32:15.094 --> 32:16.423
Good answer.

32:17.513 --> 32:19.589
This is your recommendation?

32:19.766 --> 32:22.007
The Demolition Man's an animal.

32:22.352 --> 32:26.764
He's clearly the man for a job such as this.
You could reinstate him.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.516
He's a muscle-bound grotesque...

32:30.443 --> 32:32.934
...who hasn't worn a shield in 40 years.

32:33.112 --> 32:36.030
Simon Phoenix is an old-fashioned criminal.

32:36.199 --> 32:38.108
We need an old-fashioned cop.

33:02.683 --> 33:06.301
Cryo-fac 312-618 is ready
for routine maintenance and inspection.

33:26.832 --> 33:28.623
John Spartan, 5864.

33:29.835 --> 33:32.504
Pulmonary activity approaching normal.

33:32.671 --> 33:35.162
Body temperature, 63% and rising.

33:36.842 --> 33:38.502
Biolink engaged.

33:39.595 --> 33:42.264
Laser defibrillation sequence started.

33:43.182 --> 33:45.507
Plasma transfer in 15 seconds.

33:47.436 --> 33:49.761
Plasma transfer, 10 seconds...

33:50.355 --> 33:51.684
...8 seconds...

33:52.274 --> 33:53.602
...6 seconds....

33:55.193 --> 33:57.269
Plasma transfer complete.

33:58.447 --> 33:59.941
MTL complete.

34:20.885 --> 34:23.043
Hunting down an escaped cryo-con...

34:23.388 --> 34:25.297
...by releasing another one?

34:25.806 --> 34:27.301
I am unconvinced.

34:27.475 --> 34:29.882
It's within the powers of the police charter.

34:29.978 --> 34:33.810
He can be released on limited parole
and reinstated to active duty.

34:33.982 --> 34:36.603
It's not enough to collect the '90s?

34:36.900 --> 34:39.391
Cocteau said everything in our power.

34:39.487 --> 34:41.065
I can't think of a better idea.

34:41.156 --> 34:43.313
That doesn't mean it's a good one.

34:44.826 --> 34:48.491
This man comes from a dissimilar method
of law enforcement.

34:48.663 --> 34:51.913
I'm not sure he's any different
than Simon Phoenix himself.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.114
Detective?

34:56.087 --> 34:58.412
I am Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.

34:59.090 --> 35:00.798
The year is 2032.

35:01.843 --> 35:04.334
The reason you have been released is--

35:04.512 --> 35:06.339
How long have I been under?

35:08.599 --> 35:10.010
Thirty-six years.

35:13.187 --> 35:14.681
I had a wife.

35:15.147 --> 35:17.021
What happened to my wife?

35:18.442 --> 35:21.728
Her light was extinguished
in the Big One of 2010.

35:26.951 --> 35:28.279
She died.

35:29.286 --> 35:30.994
In an earthquake.

35:31.539 --> 35:33.116
The earthquake.

35:35.709 --> 35:37.204
I had a daughter.

35:38.963 --> 35:40.457
What happened to her?

35:40.548 --> 35:41.627
John Spartan.

35:41.715 --> 35:43.874
I am Chief of Police George Earle.

35:43.968 --> 35:46.637
We didn't thaw you out
for a family reunion.

35:47.388 --> 35:51.635
Consider it fortunate that the lieutenant
did a probe on your wife.

35:51.809 --> 35:54.478
This is about you
and the cryo-con Simon Phoenix.

35:54.561 --> 35:55.641
What?

35:56.063 --> 36:00.476
Today Simon Phoenix escaped from
this cryo-facility. We've had 1 1 murders...

36:00.651 --> 36:01.730
...so far.

36:02.736 --> 36:05.986
You see, we've become a society
of peace-loving...

36:06.156 --> 36:09.572
...and understanding and we are,
quite frankly, not equipped...

36:09.660 --> 36:11.320
...to deal with this situation.

36:11.411 --> 36:15.409
There's been no deaths of unnatural causes
in San Angeles for 1 6 years.

36:15.582 --> 36:16.661
Where?

36:16.833 --> 36:21.127
The Santa Barbara, Los Angeles,
San Diego Metroplex merged in 201 1.

36:21.338 --> 36:23.377
You are in what used to be LA.

36:25.008 --> 36:26.253
That's great.

36:27.761 --> 36:30.252
-You, get me a Marlboro.
-Yes, of course.

36:32.182 --> 36:33.510
What's a Marlboro?

36:33.600 --> 36:35.758
It's a cigarette. Any cigarette.

36:37.104 --> 36:41.101
Smoking is not good for you.
Anything not good for you is bad.

36:41.942 --> 36:45.726
Hence, illegal. Alcohol, caffeine,
contact sports, meat--

36:45.946 --> 36:47.356
Are you shitting me?

36:47.447 --> 36:51.908
You are fined one credit for violation
of the verbal-morality statute.

36:52.869 --> 36:54.778
What the hell is that?

36:54.955 --> 36:57.872
- You are fined one credit....
-Bad language...

36:58.041 --> 37:01.624
...chocolate, gasoline, uneducational toys
and spicy food.

37:01.795 --> 37:05.460
Abortion is illegal, so is pregnancy
if you don't have a license.

37:05.548 --> 37:06.663
Caveman...

37:06.800 --> 37:09.884
...Iet's finish with the Rip Van Winkle
and get moving.

37:09.969 --> 37:12.460
Our Mr. Phoenix has risen from the ashes.

37:14.557 --> 37:16.882
I tracked that dirtbag for two years...

37:16.976 --> 37:20.891
...and when I finally bring him down
you turn me into an ice cube.

37:21.314 --> 37:22.892
Thanks, but no thanks.

37:23.066 --> 37:26.565
The conditions of your parole
are full reinstatement into the SAPD...

37:26.653 --> 37:30.068
...and immediate assignment
to the apprehension of Phoenix.

37:30.239 --> 37:31.235
Or...

37:33.159 --> 37:35.650
...you can go back into cryo-stasis.

37:35.995 --> 37:38.913
Not many people get a second chance,
John Spartan.

37:47.798 --> 37:50.124
Any new inforama on Simon Phoenix?

37:50.301 --> 37:52.709
There is nothing, Lenina Huxley.

37:53.429 --> 37:54.804
Where's Spartan?

37:55.306 --> 37:58.889
He went to the bathroom.
I guess he got all thawed out.

38:03.105 --> 38:05.347
I formally convey my presence.

38:07.818 --> 38:09.277
How are you doing?

38:09.653 --> 38:12.323
We're not used
to physical-contact greetings.

38:12.907 --> 38:14.152
I don't know...

38:14.241 --> 38:16.150
...if you guys know it but...

38:17.244 --> 38:19.237
...you're out of toilet paper.

38:20.664 --> 38:22.491
Did you say "toilet paper"?

38:24.501 --> 38:27.206
They used handfuls of wadded paper...

38:27.588 --> 38:29.415
...back in the 20th.

38:31.842 --> 38:35.341
I'm happy you're happy,
but in place of toilet paper...

38:35.512 --> 38:38.182
...you've got a shelf with three seashells.

38:39.600 --> 38:42.269
He doesn't know how to use the seashells.

38:46.607 --> 38:48.184
I can see how that'd be confusing.

38:48.275 --> 38:50.848
I don't believe it. Is that you, Spartan?

38:56.366 --> 38:57.742
Zach Lamb?

38:58.952 --> 39:00.530
What happened to you?

39:01.788 --> 39:03.247
I got older.

39:03.707 --> 39:06.280
My God, I remember when you were...

39:06.710 --> 39:07.990
...a rookie pilot.

39:08.086 --> 39:10.043
They finally grounded me.

39:10.213 --> 39:12.704
Shit, you were a damn good flyer.

39:13.258 --> 39:17.719
You're fined two credits for violation
of the verbal-morality statute.

39:18.054 --> 39:19.846
I'll be right back.

39:20.182 --> 39:21.841
They seem to be friends, yet...

39:21.933 --> 39:24.341
...he speaks to him
in the most profane manner.

39:24.436 --> 39:28.932
If you'd read my study, you'd know
this is how heterosexual men bonded.

39:29.274 --> 39:30.733
I knew that.

39:31.067 --> 39:35.147
Thanks a lot you shit-brained,
fuck-faced, ball-breaking, duck-fucking...

39:36.448 --> 39:38.986
-...pain in the ass.
- You're fined five credits...

39:39.075 --> 39:41.827
...for repeated violations
of the verbal-morality statute.

39:41.911 --> 39:43.738
So much for the seashells.

39:44.164 --> 39:46.240
See you in a few minutes.

39:50.086 --> 39:52.244
Voice check, Lenina Huxley.

39:52.589 --> 39:55.258
Unfortunately Simon Phoenix
was not coded.

39:55.341 --> 39:58.176
While you were sleeping
a code was installed on everyone.

39:58.261 --> 40:02.341
It was a brilliant idea by Dr. Cocteau.
An organic microchip...

40:02.598 --> 40:03.843
...is sewn into the skin.

40:03.933 --> 40:07.183
Sensors all over the city
can zero in on anyone at any time.

40:07.270 --> 40:11.102
I can't even conceive of what
police officers did before it was developed.

40:11.190 --> 40:14.310
We worked. This fascist crap
makes me want to puke.

40:14.485 --> 40:16.727
What do you think you're scratching?

40:17.363 --> 40:20.115
You really think we'd let you go
without control?

40:20.199 --> 40:22.607
Your code was implanted
when you were thawed.

40:22.702 --> 40:25.193
Why not just shove a leash up my ass?

40:25.538 --> 40:27.198
You dirty meat-eater!

40:27.999 --> 40:30.122
No matter how Viking your era was...

40:30.209 --> 40:33.245
...I cannot digest how
you ever wore a badge!

40:33.379 --> 40:36.333
You're going back, John Spartan,
you're going back!

40:36.424 --> 40:39.211
Could you two please
dump some hormones?

40:39.468 --> 40:41.627
We need every cortex we can get here.

40:41.720 --> 40:43.630
We don't need the Neanderthal.

40:43.722 --> 40:46.558
Our computer has already examined
every scenario...

40:46.642 --> 40:49.180
...resulting from the appearance
of Simon Phoenix.

40:49.270 --> 40:53.219
It's determined he'll try to set up
a drug lab and form a crime syndicate.

40:53.315 --> 40:54.975
That is correct.

40:55.985 --> 40:57.977
I hate to interrupt you two...

40:58.112 --> 40:59.820
...but that's fucking stupid.

40:59.905 --> 41:02.194
You think he wants to start a business?

41:02.283 --> 41:04.192
Phoenix is going for a gun.

41:04.326 --> 41:05.820
Plain and simple.

41:06.412 --> 41:07.657
Trust me.

41:07.996 --> 41:09.195
He's going for a gun.

41:09.289 --> 41:11.662
Who cares what this primate thinks?

41:11.959 --> 41:13.750
Resonate some understanding.

41:13.836 --> 41:17.335
The only place a person
can even view a gun in this city...

41:18.048 --> 41:19.590
...is at a museum.

41:25.973 --> 41:29.057
Welcome to the San Angeles Museum
of History.

41:29.851 --> 41:32.140
Beneath you is an excavation...

41:32.229 --> 41:35.230
...of an actual 20th-century street scene...

41:35.524 --> 41:39.308
...in downtown Los Angeles,
preserved since the earthquake of 2010.

41:41.446 --> 41:45.278
For specific information
on objects featured in the exhibit....

41:45.534 --> 41:48.072
Firearms are displayed in the Armory...

41:48.286 --> 41:50.196
...Iocated on Level A.

41:52.666 --> 41:55.417
You are entering the Hall of Violence...

41:55.585 --> 41:59.286
...a visual representation
of the primitive behavior prevalent...

41:59.464 --> 42:01.872
...during the late 20th century.

42:02.550 --> 42:04.258
Home, sweet home.

42:07.972 --> 42:12.469
John Spartan, even if Simon Phoenix
was able to locate the cache of firearms...

42:12.644 --> 42:14.767
...it'd be impossible to remove them.

42:14.854 --> 42:18.555
She's right. They're located
in a maximum-security armory exhibit.

42:18.650 --> 42:21.057
It's just a hunch. Trust me on this.

42:21.319 --> 42:22.730
It's a cop thing.

42:22.904 --> 42:24.528
And what am l, a frog?

42:26.699 --> 42:28.075
Excuse me.

42:28.368 --> 42:29.696
I'll drive.

42:34.207 --> 42:36.994
Resetting all bio-links for new driver.

42:37.251 --> 42:39.624
Weight, height, peripheral vision set.

42:40.004 --> 42:41.664
If you would like...

42:41.839 --> 42:46.252
...to commence transportation,
John Spartan, initialize sequence now.

42:46.719 --> 42:48.094
You drive.

42:53.392 --> 42:55.385
Welcome, Lenina Huxley.

43:06.739 --> 43:09.859
You seem very much alone,
John Spartan, but...

43:10.034 --> 43:12.276
...things aren't all that different.

43:12.370 --> 43:14.777
Perhaps you'd like to hear
an oldies station?

43:14.872 --> 43:16.911
"Oh, what a relief it is. "

43:17.208 --> 43:19.366
This is the town's most popular station.

43:19.460 --> 43:22.129
Wall-to-wall mini-tunes.
You called them "commercials."

43:22.213 --> 43:24.371
The classic you've been waiting for.

43:24.465 --> 43:27.382
The number one request:
"Armour Hot Dogs. "

43:28.219 --> 43:30.211
"Kids eat Armour Hot Dogs.... "

43:30.429 --> 43:32.089
This is my fave!

43:32.556 --> 43:34.679
"Skinny kids, kids who climb on rocks

43:34.767 --> 43:37.637
"Tall kids, sissy kids, even kids with...

43:37.895 --> 43:39.555
"...chicken pox love hot dogs

43:39.646 --> 43:41.306
"Armour Hot Dogs

43:41.774 --> 43:44.062
"The dogs kids love to bite. "

43:51.074 --> 43:53.612
Someone put me back in the fridge.

43:55.787 --> 43:58.409
You are entering the armory exhibit.

43:58.957 --> 44:02.207
Here you will find displays
in the cabinets and walls....

44:02.294 --> 44:04.701
So sorry. Didn't see you there.

44:06.798 --> 44:08.209
Sweet baby.

44:10.677 --> 44:11.958
Oh, shit.

44:21.480 --> 44:23.472
This is what I'm talking about.

44:23.982 --> 44:25.560
How do I get in here?

44:25.984 --> 44:29.934
Is there a 15-day waiting period?
Or can I just take one now?

44:31.698 --> 44:33.192
Motherfucker.

44:39.122 --> 44:40.581
Oh, fuck it.

44:40.999 --> 44:42.410
Mellow greetings.

44:42.792 --> 44:44.619
What seems to be your boggle?

44:44.711 --> 44:46.086
My "boggle"?

44:51.718 --> 44:53.342
How much do you weigh?

44:53.845 --> 44:54.960
I weigh--

45:02.353 --> 45:04.891
Please vacate the museum, patrons.

45:05.356 --> 45:06.387
Be calm.

45:07.108 --> 45:08.768
Please vacate...

45:09.027 --> 45:11.399
...the museum, patrons. Be calm.

45:11.571 --> 45:14.109
Wait a minute, this is the future.

45:14.240 --> 45:16.280
Where are all the phaser guns?

45:21.539 --> 45:23.117
Mellow greetings, sir.

45:23.207 --> 45:24.867
What's your boggle?

45:31.507 --> 45:33.666
Warning, please exit rapidly.

45:33.759 --> 45:37.294
The magnetic accelerator gun,
the last hand-held weapon...

45:37.388 --> 45:40.508
...of this millennium,
displaced the flow of neutrons...

45:40.599 --> 45:44.182
...through a nonlinear cycloid
electromagnetic accumulator.

45:44.520 --> 45:46.311
So, what? It needs batteries?

45:46.397 --> 45:49.564
What size? Where the fuck
do you find batteries?

45:49.692 --> 45:51.566
Is there a battery store around here?

45:51.652 --> 45:53.561
Excuse me, patron. Can l--

45:55.906 --> 45:57.566
Where's Radio Shack?

46:03.914 --> 46:05.622
Sweet music to my ears.

46:05.958 --> 46:10.169
Activated, the magnetic accelerator gun
will achieve fusion in 2.6 minutes.

46:10.587 --> 46:14.585
I was thinking about leaving quickly.
Patience is not one of my virtues.

46:27.229 --> 46:28.604
Did you see that?

46:28.689 --> 46:29.684
What?

46:29.773 --> 46:33.059
Never mind. I give up trying
to figure this place out.

46:33.902 --> 46:36.393
Excuse me, Rambo. I need to borrow this.

46:41.618 --> 46:43.741
Access and correlate procedure.

46:43.912 --> 46:46.320
Establish communication with intruder.

46:46.456 --> 46:47.571
Wrong.

46:47.749 --> 46:50.667
-Luke Skywalker, use the Force.
-Oh, dear.

46:50.919 --> 46:54.039
-What the hell is this?
-It's a glow-rod. It's what we got.

46:54.131 --> 46:55.329
Does it work?

46:59.344 --> 47:00.589
Guess so.

47:00.762 --> 47:02.553
He's trapped in Section 8.

47:02.639 --> 47:04.845
I doubt it. Make sure the building's clear.

47:04.933 --> 47:06.392
Done. I want a visual.

47:06.476 --> 47:10.059
Every corridor of the museum,
I want full sensors routed to me.

47:12.857 --> 47:15.431
You guys wait here. Give me 1 0 minutes.

47:16.653 --> 47:19.986
Museum patron,
you are now confined to the armory.

47:22.867 --> 47:26.201
Museum patron, you are now confined
to the Armory.

47:32.168 --> 47:34.659
The armory exhibit is now sealed.

47:35.505 --> 47:39.419
All museum patrons still in the facility
should remain calm.

47:40.802 --> 47:42.510
Help is imminent.

47:46.391 --> 47:48.798
This museum is no longer sealed.

47:49.852 --> 47:52.141
What can I say? I'm a blast from the past.

47:52.230 --> 47:54.056
You should've stayed there.

47:54.315 --> 47:56.853
That voice sounds familiar. Who is that?

48:00.821 --> 48:02.529
Bad aim, Blondie.

48:02.698 --> 48:04.193
John Spartan?

48:04.533 --> 48:07.985
They let anybody into this century!
What're you doing here?

48:11.666 --> 48:13.124
Simon says:. bleed!

48:15.920 --> 48:17.497
Great. Just great.

48:17.630 --> 48:19.421
You're making it too easy.

48:19.548 --> 48:21.707
Come on, you piece of shit!

48:22.593 --> 48:24.004
Let me get this right.

48:24.094 --> 48:27.843
They defrosted you just
so you could lasso my piddly ass?

48:29.558 --> 48:32.345
I've dreamed about killing you for 40 years.

48:35.022 --> 48:36.564
Keep dreaming!

49:35.874 --> 49:37.866
Magnetic accelerator activated.

49:37.959 --> 49:39.204
About time.

49:39.294 --> 49:40.492
Past is over!

49:40.629 --> 49:42.336
Time for something new and improved!

49:42.422 --> 49:43.750
Oh, hell.

49:48.303 --> 49:50.130
Shit! I love this gun!

49:57.270 --> 49:59.144
How do you like the future?

50:11.117 --> 50:12.280
Come on!

50:20.334 --> 50:21.200
That must hurt!

50:21.294 --> 50:23.002
Huh, Soldier Boy?

50:24.589 --> 50:25.668
You're on TV!

50:25.756 --> 50:26.836
Shit!

50:34.223 --> 50:35.302
You're dead!

50:35.391 --> 50:37.348
Forgot to say:. "Simon says."

50:42.481 --> 50:43.513
Oh, shit.

50:43.607 --> 50:44.936
Good one.

50:48.154 --> 50:49.897
Sorry, you must go!

50:50.031 --> 50:51.193
Shit!

51:21.478 --> 51:24.930
Our noble facility has been desecrated
by hooligans.

51:26.024 --> 51:28.515
Someone will pay dearly for this.

51:32.406 --> 51:36.534
Sir, the stress breeder is inside
being demobilized as we speak.

51:38.620 --> 51:41.740
Shit. Being frozen must've thrown
my aim off.

51:42.332 --> 51:44.740
I'll get you with the next shot.

51:46.545 --> 51:48.122
I don't think so.

51:50.298 --> 51:52.457
No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang.

51:53.927 --> 51:55.920
You were doing so well.

51:56.930 --> 51:59.088
Don't you have a job to do?

52:00.016 --> 52:03.635
Isn't there a thought repeating
in your barbaric brain?

52:04.312 --> 52:06.056
The name Friendly.

52:06.231 --> 52:08.022
Mr. Edgar Friendly.

52:08.525 --> 52:10.897
Don't you have someone to kill?

52:18.618 --> 52:20.611
-Yeah, I do.
-Excellent.

52:22.247 --> 52:24.239
Then go and do your job.

52:26.876 --> 52:27.790
Shit.

52:28.002 --> 52:29.746
Saved by the bell.

52:35.885 --> 52:37.048
Shit!

52:46.270 --> 52:47.433
Damn!

52:49.816 --> 52:51.974
You're lucky he didn't whack you.

52:52.318 --> 52:56.612
I must say that "whacking," whatever it is,
sounds most disagreeable.

52:57.490 --> 52:59.317
You scared him away.

52:59.450 --> 53:02.202
I don't know how to thank you.
You saved my life.

53:02.286 --> 53:03.697
No problem.

53:06.165 --> 53:08.288
Not bad for a 74-year-old.

53:09.043 --> 53:11.997
Simon Phoenix knows
he has some competition.

53:12.213 --> 53:14.371
He's finally matched his meat.

53:14.507 --> 53:16.630
You really licked his ass.

53:17.718 --> 53:19.545
That's "met his match"...

53:19.679 --> 53:21.718
...and "kicked his ass."

53:22.348 --> 53:24.921
"Met his match and kicked his ass."

53:25.893 --> 53:27.304
Captain Earle....

53:27.853 --> 53:29.513
Who is this man?

53:30.064 --> 53:34.393
John Spartan, temporarily reinstated
to the San Angeles Police Department...

53:34.568 --> 53:37.403
...to pursue the escaped cryo-con
Simon Phoenix.

53:38.739 --> 53:42.025
You told us to do everything
in our power to capture him.

53:42.243 --> 53:43.950
Yes, I did. I did.

53:44.286 --> 53:47.323
Yes, I do recall the exploits
of Mr. John Spartan.

53:48.374 --> 53:50.995
Yes, of course. The Demolition Man.

53:51.960 --> 53:53.704
That's quite all right.

53:53.796 --> 53:55.539
Unexpected. Creative.

53:56.799 --> 53:58.257
But quite all right.

53:58.342 --> 54:00.251
John Spartan, welcome.

54:01.303 --> 54:03.461
In honor of your arrival and your...

54:03.555 --> 54:05.963
...protection of the sanctity of human life...

54:06.058 --> 54:07.766
...namely my own...

54:07.893 --> 54:10.598
...I'd like to invite you to join me
for dinner tonight.

54:10.687 --> 54:11.850
Both of you.

54:11.939 --> 54:13.397
Please, I insist.

54:13.649 --> 54:15.807
I would like you to accompany me...

54:15.943 --> 54:17.602
...to Pizza Hut.

54:20.947 --> 54:23.023
Look forward to it. Thanks.

54:29.247 --> 54:30.623
"Pizza Hut?"

54:34.085 --> 54:35.959
So let me get this right:

54:36.087 --> 54:40.002
Spacely Sprockets here, who's now
the man in charge, the Mayor-Gov...

54:40.091 --> 54:42.499
...who wants to take me to Pizza Hut...

54:42.594 --> 54:44.302
...and I wouldn't mind a pizza...

54:44.387 --> 54:46.261
...has also built the damn cryo-prison?

54:46.348 --> 54:48.720
John Spartan, you are fined....

54:49.017 --> 54:51.934
Dr. Cocteau is the most important man
in town.

54:52.103 --> 54:54.808
He practically created our whole way
of life...

54:54.898 --> 54:56.273
...savage.

54:56.900 --> 54:58.180
He can have it.

54:59.277 --> 55:00.736
Phoenix could be anywhere...

55:00.820 --> 55:02.528
...but not being coded can limit him.

55:02.614 --> 55:04.690
Correct. Money is outmoded.

55:04.782 --> 55:06.822
All transactions are through codes.

55:06.910 --> 55:09.661
So he can't buy food
or a place to stay for the night.

55:09.746 --> 55:12.415
It'd be a waste of time to mug someone.

55:13.166 --> 55:15.538
Unless he rips off someone's hand.

55:15.627 --> 55:17.666
But with officers patrolling...

55:17.754 --> 55:21.087
...it should be just a matter
of tick-tocks before--

55:22.216 --> 55:24.174
We already have a backup plan.

55:25.344 --> 55:27.752
We can wait for another code to go red.

55:28.222 --> 55:31.093
When Phoenix performs
another MurderDeathKill...

55:31.267 --> 55:34.019
...we'll know exactly where to pounce.

55:34.520 --> 55:35.386
Great plan.

55:35.480 --> 55:36.855
Thank you.

55:42.778 --> 55:46.064
I've been an enthusiast of your escapades
for quite some time.

55:46.157 --> 55:50.285
In fact, I perused some visuals
from the Schwarzenegger Library.

55:50.786 --> 55:51.866
Hold it.

55:52.788 --> 55:54.496
"The Schwarzenegger Library?"

55:54.582 --> 55:57.369
Yes, the Schwarzenegger
Presidential Library.

55:57.626 --> 55:59.121
Wasn't he an actor?

55:59.295 --> 56:01.003
He was President?

56:01.547 --> 56:05.876
Even though he wasn't a native,
his popularity caused the 61st Amendment.

56:06.177 --> 56:08.050
I don't want to know.

56:10.139 --> 56:11.514
President?

56:21.025 --> 56:23.313
What's this? No welcome mat?

56:25.654 --> 56:27.148
What is this?

56:30.325 --> 56:32.899
How do they expect you to kill somebody?

56:35.164 --> 56:38.663
Shit, I love that smell.
Reminds me of biscuits and gravy.

56:39.001 --> 56:41.159
All right. A job is a job.

56:42.880 --> 56:47.173
Edgar Friendly, whoever the fuck you are,
prepare for Simon Phoenix.

56:50.387 --> 56:52.011
What's with Cocteau?

56:52.681 --> 56:55.468
He says I saved his life,
though I'm not sure of it.

56:55.559 --> 56:58.513
My reward is dinner and dancing
at Pizza Hut?

56:58.770 --> 57:01.641
I like a big, fat piece of pizza, but....

57:01.857 --> 57:03.933
Your tone is quasi-facetious.

57:04.443 --> 57:07.977
Pizza Hut is the only restaurant
to survive the Franchise Wars.

57:08.113 --> 57:09.192
So?

57:10.156 --> 57:12.315
Now all restaurants are Pizza Hut.

57:13.868 --> 57:15.113
No way.

57:24.754 --> 57:26.628
Welcome to Pizza Hut.

57:27.257 --> 57:28.881
Enjoy your meal.

57:30.593 --> 57:33.001
"Valley of the Jolly Green Giant

57:35.682 --> 57:37.924
"Good things from the garden

57:38.184 --> 57:40.058
"Garden in the valley

57:40.687 --> 57:43.178
"Valley of the Jolly Green Giant"

57:46.401 --> 57:48.559
Here comes the Neanderthal.

57:49.153 --> 57:52.024
Mr. Spartan over there please,
and Lieutenant....

57:52.156 --> 57:53.271
Thank you.

57:56.411 --> 57:58.071
How are you doing?

58:00.540 --> 58:02.616
Enjoy-joy your meal, sir.

58:03.459 --> 58:04.622
Good thing I'm hungry.

58:04.710 --> 58:09.171
Ladies and gentlemen, please raise
your glasses to the hero of the hour...

58:09.757 --> 58:11.335
...my savior...

58:11.467 --> 58:13.590
...Detective John Spartan.

58:15.888 --> 58:17.263
Appreciate it.

58:20.434 --> 58:22.178
Greetings and salutations.

58:22.436 --> 58:24.014
I'm Associate Bob.

58:24.105 --> 58:27.770
We met before, ever so briefly.
I was in fear at the time.

58:28.943 --> 58:30.816
Do you have the salt?

58:31.862 --> 58:34.863
Salt is not good for you, hence, it is illegal.

58:35.116 --> 58:37.025
So, John Spartan, tell me...

58:37.868 --> 58:40.786
...what do you think of San Angeles, 2032?

58:42.540 --> 58:45.790
I thought the future would be
a rotting cesspool.

58:46.794 --> 58:49.960
You weren't here
when the real disturbances began.

58:50.047 --> 58:52.716
Civilization tried to destroy itself.

58:53.133 --> 58:56.134
The city degenerated into a total fear zone.

58:56.637 --> 59:01.050
People stayed home, afraid to go out.
People wanted the madness over.

59:02.267 --> 59:05.102
When I saw the chance
to make things right...

59:05.270 --> 59:06.729
...I seized it.

59:08.315 --> 59:12.229
If I had not, the radiance
of San Angeles would not be here.

59:12.653 --> 59:17.361
Just your rotting cesspool of hate
and suffering. Which would you prefer?

59:17.658 --> 59:21.323
Can you book me a flight out of here
when the sermon's over?

59:21.495 --> 59:22.823
John Spartan...

59:22.996 --> 59:26.246
...for your crimes you would
surely have died...

59:26.333 --> 59:27.744
...in jail before now.

59:27.834 --> 59:31.832
Even you must appreciate
the persuasively tranquil humanity...

59:32.339 --> 59:34.628
...of the cryo-prison system?

59:35.509 --> 59:40.301
I don't want to spoil your dinner, but
my cryo-sentence was no sweet lullaby.

59:40.472 --> 59:42.511
I had feelings and thoughts.

59:42.724 --> 59:46.473
How about a 36-year nightmare
about people caught in a burning building?

59:46.561 --> 59:48.601
You were awake? I don't think so.

59:48.688 --> 59:50.099
I think so.

59:50.607 --> 59:54.521
My wife beating her fists against a block
of ice that was her husband.

59:54.611 --> 59:59.189
Then you woke me up and told me
everything that meant something is gone.

59:59.699 --> 01:00:03.827
It would have been more humane
to leave me to the fucking crows.

01:00:04.996 --> 01:00:08.116
What would you say
if I called you a brutish fossil...

01:00:08.208 --> 01:00:11.659
...symbolic of the decayed era
gratefully forgotten?

01:00:13.171 --> 01:00:14.831
I don't know. "Thanks?"

01:00:15.548 --> 01:00:17.707
I thought during rehabilitation...

01:00:17.884 --> 01:00:21.882
...the prisoners were not conscious.
A person would go insane.

01:00:22.013 --> 01:00:24.006
The side-effects of the cryo-process...

01:00:24.098 --> 01:00:25.474
...are unavoidable.

01:00:25.558 --> 01:00:27.551
You were found guilty of a crime.

01:00:27.643 --> 01:00:29.719
You owed and still owe a debt to society.

01:00:29.812 --> 01:00:31.057
There's nothing I can do.

01:00:31.147 --> 01:00:33.934
Yes, call for backup.
I'll be across the street.

01:00:34.025 --> 01:00:35.484
Where are you going?

01:00:35.568 --> 01:00:39.482
Bad guys about to do bad things.
It's just one of those hunches.

01:01:00.051 --> 01:01:01.213
Go for the truck!

01:01:01.302 --> 01:01:03.010
The food's in the truck!

01:01:05.806 --> 01:01:07.846
Grab the big box! Move!

01:01:19.695 --> 01:01:23.194
You'll regret this the rest of your life.
Both seconds of it.

01:01:28.454 --> 01:01:29.616
Good night!

01:01:39.423 --> 01:01:40.703
Get him!

01:01:58.483 --> 01:02:00.809
What a fucking hero. Come on.

01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:11.745
Please, don't.

01:02:17.711 --> 01:02:18.991
What the hell?

01:02:20.005 --> 01:02:21.665
Such reckless abandonment.

01:02:21.756 --> 01:02:24.164
Looks like there is a new shepherd in town.

01:02:24.259 --> 01:02:26.548
That's "sheriff." Who are those guys?

01:02:26.636 --> 01:02:28.676
They're known as "scraps."

01:02:29.014 --> 01:02:31.683
Outcasts and deserters who choose
to live beneath us...

01:02:31.766 --> 01:02:34.340
...in sewers and abandoned tunnels.

01:02:35.353 --> 01:02:38.437
They're a constant irritation
to our harmony.

01:02:38.857 --> 01:02:40.648
They're nothing but thugs.

01:02:41.025 --> 01:02:45.189
A society of thieves. The last remaining
criminal element in the city.

01:02:45.446 --> 01:02:48.815
But plans are in progress
to purge this peril from our day.

01:02:49.158 --> 01:02:51.614
You're better live than on laser disk.

01:02:51.703 --> 01:02:55.285
The way you paused to make a witticism
before doing battle...

01:02:55.456 --> 01:02:57.200
...with that Scrap--

01:02:57.375 --> 01:02:59.368
This isn't the Wild West, okay?

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:01.916
The Wild West wasn't even the Wild West.

01:03:02.004 --> 01:03:03.831
Hurting people isn't good.

01:03:04.132 --> 01:03:05.792
Sometimes it is, but not...

01:03:05.883 --> 01:03:08.209
...when it's people looking for food.

01:03:16.686 --> 01:03:19.011
San Angeles time is now 22:15.

01:03:20.314 --> 01:03:21.559
Coding off.

01:03:21.732 --> 01:03:22.847
Auto-drive.

01:03:22.942 --> 01:03:24.733
Auto-drive engaged.

01:03:30.241 --> 01:03:32.364
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

01:03:34.161 --> 01:03:36.487
No need for a de-hurtful retraction.

01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:39.327
I assimilated too much contraband.

01:03:39.625 --> 01:03:43.753
I fleshed you out as
a blow-up-the-bad- guy-while-grinning type.

01:03:44.004 --> 01:03:48.465
But you're the moody-gunslinger-who-
will-only-draw-when-he-must type.

01:03:49.593 --> 01:03:50.423
Stop.

01:03:50.511 --> 01:03:51.341
What?

01:03:51.428 --> 01:03:53.670
I just do my job and things get--

01:03:53.764 --> 01:03:54.927
Demolished.

01:04:02.523 --> 01:04:06.141
I think of my daughter growing up
in a place like this.

01:04:06.402 --> 01:04:09.189
I'm afraid she'll think I'm a primitive.

01:04:09.363 --> 01:04:12.399
As much as I want to see her,
I almost don't want to.

01:04:12.491 --> 01:04:15.112
Because I don't think I'll fit in well.

01:04:15.285 --> 01:04:16.696
Not at all.

01:04:19.081 --> 01:04:23.161
It'd be a minor misuse of police powers,
but I could do a search for you.

01:04:28.966 --> 01:04:30.164
Sorry.

01:04:34.262 --> 01:04:36.670
Subject change. I got what you wanted.

01:04:36.807 --> 01:04:37.969
Great.

01:04:42.229 --> 01:04:43.604
What's that for?

01:04:44.689 --> 01:04:46.896
It's just one of those cop hunches.

01:04:56.368 --> 01:04:57.613
Lights.

01:04:59.162 --> 01:05:00.905
I've changed that.

01:05:01.748 --> 01:05:03.159
Illuminate.

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:06.078
Deluminate.

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:10.875
Isn't that nicer?

01:05:11.007 --> 01:05:12.667
Go ahead, you try.

01:05:14.093 --> 01:05:15.504
Illuminate.

01:05:18.097 --> 01:05:20.719
Raymond, Raymond, we've got to talk.

01:05:21.517 --> 01:05:23.142
How did you get in?

01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:25.641
Wish I knew. I got pass codes.

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:28.100
Routes to underground kingdoms.

01:05:28.191 --> 01:05:31.773
Complete access
to the industrial data-grid interface.

01:05:32.195 --> 01:05:34.353
I don't even know what that means.

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:37.531
But I've been meaning to ask you,
because I like it!

01:05:37.617 --> 01:05:39.111
I like it a lot!

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:43.444
You have been given these skills
for a reason.

01:05:43.539 --> 01:05:45.947
Not for your personal amusement.

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:50.200
Your job is to kill Mr. Edgar Friendly
and stop a revolution.

01:05:51.172 --> 01:05:53.745
That is why you were rehabilitated.

01:05:56.802 --> 01:06:00.385
All right. I'm going to do
your dastardly deed for you.

01:06:01.307 --> 01:06:04.261
But it'll be more difficult than you thought.

01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:06.635
I'm going to need some help.

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:10.229
I'll need about five
or six more "special" men.

01:06:11.567 --> 01:06:13.227
I happen to have a list.

01:06:13.402 --> 01:06:18.147
I wouldn't want you to defrost any
of those killer types, know what I mean?

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:22.072
And none of those motherfuckers
from New York. They're too uptight.

01:06:22.161 --> 01:06:25.115
So you're going to be the only killer type?

01:06:29.585 --> 01:06:30.664
Fine.

01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:33.046
Take care of it.

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:36.001
Just get it over with.

01:06:36.341 --> 01:06:38.714
You're more trouble than you're worth.

01:06:38.927 --> 01:06:41.169
Oh, Raymond, don't say that.

01:06:43.015 --> 01:06:45.553
And what do I get out of all this?

01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.597
What do you want?

01:06:50.189 --> 01:06:51.184
Malibu.

01:06:52.107 --> 01:06:55.606
Santa Monica.
Hell, how about all the coastal cities?

01:06:57.195 --> 01:06:59.022
I'll bear it in mind.

01:06:59.197 --> 01:07:02.198
-Good, I'll send you a memo.
-Just do your job!

01:07:06.872 --> 01:07:09.279
What is John Spartan doing here?

01:07:11.042 --> 01:07:13.201
Did you invite him to this party?

01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:17.206
Look, you finish your business...

01:07:17.299 --> 01:07:19.457
...and I'll stuff him back in the freezer.

01:07:19.551 --> 01:07:21.793
Think of him as a guarantee.

01:07:22.053 --> 01:07:23.512
"A guarantee?"

01:07:24.306 --> 01:07:26.631
You don't have much of a guarantee.

01:07:27.225 --> 01:07:30.511
I took care of Spartan once,
I'll take care of him again.

01:07:33.815 --> 01:07:36.223
Now we need those men defrosted.

01:07:40.905 --> 01:07:42.565
Is this where you live?

01:07:42.741 --> 01:07:44.151
Very not bad.

01:07:44.325 --> 01:07:45.440
Thank you.

01:07:46.077 --> 01:07:48.070
Where will I be staying?

01:07:48.246 --> 01:07:51.615
I've procured you a domicile
down the corridor from my own.

01:07:55.044 --> 01:07:57.998
Everything is voice coded,
so if you need something, just ask.

01:07:58.089 --> 01:07:59.252
Lights.

01:08:00.842 --> 01:08:02.300
What do you think?

01:08:03.303 --> 01:08:07.003
Clicked off a lot of credits to create
the perfect 20th-century apartment.

01:08:07.098 --> 01:08:08.426
It's very....

01:08:08.599 --> 01:08:09.679
Isn't it?

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:13.931
John Spartan....

01:08:16.357 --> 01:08:18.848
There's a well-known, documented...

01:08:19.026 --> 01:08:21.600
...connection between sex and violence.

01:08:22.363 --> 01:08:24.439
Not so much a causal effect...

01:08:24.615 --> 01:08:27.700
...but a general state
of neurological arousal.

01:08:28.202 --> 01:08:29.399
And...

01:08:29.703 --> 01:08:33.488
...after having observed
your behavior this evening and...

01:08:34.375 --> 01:08:36.617
...my resultant condition...

01:08:39.714 --> 01:08:42.714
...I was wondering
if you'd like to have sex?

01:08:48.055 --> 01:08:49.134
With you?

01:08:51.809 --> 01:08:52.721
Here?

01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:54.890
Now?

01:08:57.648 --> 01:08:58.560
Yeah.

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:00.349
Great!

01:09:03.069 --> 01:09:04.564
I'll be right back.

01:09:22.089 --> 01:09:23.464
Love Boat?

01:09:43.068 --> 01:09:44.313
There you go.

01:09:49.908 --> 01:09:53.028
Now, just relax.
We'll begin in a few seconds.

01:09:54.246 --> 01:09:55.574
Begin what?

01:09:56.248 --> 01:09:58.157
Having sex, of course.

01:10:56.974 --> 01:10:58.433
You broke contact.

01:10:58.601 --> 01:11:01.056
"Contact?" I didn't even touch you yet.

01:11:01.145 --> 01:11:03.303
You said you wanted to make love.

01:11:03.648 --> 01:11:05.225
Is that what this is?

01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:12.236
Vir-sex produces high alpha waves
during transference of sexual energies.

01:11:12.448 --> 01:11:14.986
Let's do it the old-fashioned way.

01:11:15.993 --> 01:11:17.321
Disgusting!

01:11:17.495 --> 01:11:18.657
You mean...

01:11:20.122 --> 01:11:23.740
-...fluid transfer?
-No, I mean boning, the wild mambo.

01:11:25.127 --> 01:11:26.835
That is no longer done.

01:11:27.171 --> 01:11:30.374
Do you know what the exchange
of bodily fluids leads to?

01:11:30.507 --> 01:11:32.880
Kids, smoking, desire to raid the fridge.

01:11:32.968 --> 01:11:37.677
Rampant exchange of bodily fluids
was a major cause of society's downfall.

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:41.260
After AlDS, there was NRS,
then there was UBT.

01:11:41.852 --> 01:11:44.972
One of the first things Cocteau did
was to outlaw...

01:11:45.147 --> 01:11:49.145
...and engineer all fluid transfer
out of socially acceptable behavior.

01:11:49.359 --> 01:11:52.029
Not even a mouth transfer's condoned.

01:11:52.196 --> 01:11:53.606
Kissing's not allowed?

01:11:53.697 --> 01:11:55.191
I was a good kisser.

01:11:56.992 --> 01:11:58.320
What about kids?

01:11:58.869 --> 01:12:00.328
Procreation?

01:12:00.662 --> 01:12:02.156
We go to a lab.

01:12:02.372 --> 01:12:04.448
Fluids are purified, screened...

01:12:04.541 --> 01:12:07.827
...and transferred by authorized
medical personnel only.

01:12:08.003 --> 01:12:09.877
It is the only legal way.

01:12:13.341 --> 01:12:14.800
What're you doing?

01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:16.921
Breaking the law.

01:12:18.722 --> 01:12:20.845
You are a savage creature.

01:12:21.349 --> 01:12:23.887
I wish you to leave my domicile. Now!

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.728
You know....

01:12:52.213 --> 01:12:54.835
Code accepted. Be well, John Spartan.

01:13:05.059 --> 01:13:06.304
Lights.

01:13:24.078 --> 01:13:26.949
"He doesn't know how
to use the three seashells."

01:13:33.796 --> 01:13:35.456
Happy Halloween.

01:14:06.954 --> 01:14:09.030
"Behavioral engineering?"

01:14:10.165 --> 01:14:13.949
Hi, Martin, I was thinking....
Oh, my God, I'm sorry, wrong number.

01:14:26.849 --> 01:14:29.885
Our noble facility has been desecrated
by hooligans.

01:14:30.811 --> 01:14:33.183
Someone will pay dearly for this.

01:14:36.858 --> 01:14:40.310
Sir, the stress breeder
is inside being demobilized.

01:14:41.822 --> 01:14:44.941
Shit! Being frozen must've thrown
my aim off. Don't worry.

01:14:45.033 --> 01:14:46.527
The next shot.

01:14:46.702 --> 01:14:48.326
I don't think so.

01:14:48.995 --> 01:14:51.154
No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang.

01:15:04.219 --> 01:15:06.377
I'm sorry about last night.

01:15:08.348 --> 01:15:09.842
I made this for you.

01:15:13.728 --> 01:15:14.677
For me?

01:15:17.399 --> 01:15:18.727
Thank you.

01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:23.232
I'll drive.

01:15:23.696 --> 01:15:26.069
I must learn to do this sometime.

01:15:39.921 --> 01:15:41.748
Thanks for the lovely gift.

01:15:42.715 --> 01:15:47.424
I don't know what was in my cryo-sludge
but when I thawed, I wanted to knit.

01:15:47.929 --> 01:15:51.878
How come I know what a zipperfoot,
a shuttle and a bobbin is?

01:15:52.934 --> 01:15:55.851
I could weave a throw rug now
with my eyes closed.

01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:58.305
It's part of your rehab program.

01:15:58.397 --> 01:16:01.185
For each inmate the computer
draws up a skill or trade...

01:16:01.275 --> 01:16:03.184
...suited to their genetic disposition.

01:16:03.277 --> 01:16:04.985
It implants the knowledge...

01:16:05.071 --> 01:16:08.155
...and the desire to carry out
the training assigned.

01:16:09.784 --> 01:16:11.278
I'm a seamstress?

01:16:11.744 --> 01:16:13.072
That's great.

01:16:13.245 --> 01:16:15.867
I come out of cryo-prison
and I'm Betsy-fucking-Ross.

01:16:15.956 --> 01:16:18.412
Phoenix can access computers,
operate all vehicles...

01:16:18.501 --> 01:16:20.873
...knows the location
of everything in town...

01:16:20.961 --> 01:16:23.583
...and is three times stronger than before?

01:16:26.133 --> 01:16:28.624
Can you get me his rehab program?

01:16:31.263 --> 01:16:34.181
-I'm a seamstress.
-Access code for Simon Phoenix.

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:36.260
Access Simon Phoenix.

01:16:36.810 --> 01:16:38.091
Accessing.

01:16:39.438 --> 01:16:40.683
Access denied.

01:16:41.607 --> 01:16:43.184
-What?
-Security override.

01:16:43.275 --> 01:16:44.817
That can't be right.

01:16:48.655 --> 01:16:51.028
Access granted, Officer Huxley.

01:16:52.076 --> 01:16:55.160
Accessing Simon Phoenix,
Deepfile rehab 65-R.

01:16:55.996 --> 01:16:57.194
Urban Combatkill.

01:16:57.289 --> 01:16:59.661
Torture Methodology.
Computer Override Authority.

01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:01.707
-There must be a mistake.
-Survival Tactics.

01:17:01.793 --> 01:17:05.162
Terrorism Tactics. Weapons Training.
Martial Arts. MurderDeathKill.

01:17:05.255 --> 01:17:07.414
Explosives Technician. Violent Behavior.

01:17:07.507 --> 01:17:10.378
-This isn't a rehab program.
-No kidding.

01:17:10.677 --> 01:17:12.551
This would create a monster.

01:17:12.638 --> 01:17:14.262
Who develops these programs?

01:17:14.348 --> 01:17:16.008
Cocteau lndustries.

01:17:16.808 --> 01:17:18.552
But why would the benevolent...

01:17:18.643 --> 01:17:21.728
...Dr. Cocteau send such
a brute savage into our midst?

01:17:21.813 --> 01:17:23.722
Good question. Let's go ask him.

01:17:23.815 --> 01:17:27.516
You do not accuse our savior
of being connected with a...

01:17:27.694 --> 01:17:30.363
...multi-murderer like Phoenix. It's...

01:17:31.198 --> 01:17:32.478
...rude.

01:17:32.824 --> 01:17:34.199
I'll be subtle.

01:17:35.535 --> 01:17:37.029
I'm good at subtle.

01:17:39.205 --> 01:17:40.700
Mellow greetings.

01:17:40.874 --> 01:17:42.368
We welcome you...

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:45.454
...to the Cocteau Behavioral
Engineering Complex.

01:17:45.545 --> 01:17:46.660
Be well.

01:17:46.838 --> 01:17:48.878
Enhance your calm, John Spartan.

01:17:54.179 --> 01:17:57.797
Mellow apologies for my lack
of physical disposition...

01:17:58.183 --> 01:18:00.092
...but I have a city-gov to run.

01:18:00.185 --> 01:18:01.762
Well, run this.

01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:05.436
You programmed Phoenix's rehab
to turn him into a terrorist.

01:18:05.523 --> 01:18:08.097
And I don't think his escape
was an accident.

01:18:08.192 --> 01:18:09.391
Very subtle.

01:18:09.986 --> 01:18:12.192
Outside the museum,
why didn't he kill you?

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:13.655
What did you say?

01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:16.065
I don't remember. Does it matter?

01:18:16.242 --> 01:18:18.484
It matters. I saw the security disk.

01:18:18.578 --> 01:18:22.362
He had 10 seconds to figure out
where to put the hole in your head.

01:18:22.582 --> 01:18:26.994
This display of barbaric behavior
was unacceptable even in your time.

01:18:29.422 --> 01:18:30.964
But it worked.

01:18:36.095 --> 01:18:40.674
When Phoenix has a gun, 10 seconds
is 9 1/2 seconds longer than you get.

01:18:41.601 --> 01:18:43.143
Not everyone is as eager as you...

01:18:43.227 --> 01:18:46.726
...to resort to violence
to solve life's difficulties.

01:18:48.274 --> 01:18:53.149
I wonder if the chaos in the museum
was the result of Mr. Phoenix's presence.

01:18:54.071 --> 01:18:55.530
Wonder about this...

01:18:55.614 --> 01:18:56.812
...shithead.

01:18:56.907 --> 01:19:00.442
If you think you got this maniac
under control, trust me...

01:19:00.619 --> 01:19:01.948
...you don't.

01:19:02.246 --> 01:19:06.244
Is there something specific you plan
to do with that archaic device?

01:19:09.753 --> 01:19:11.413
No, I didn't think so.

01:19:13.465 --> 01:19:16.585
The only thing I haven't got
under control is you.

01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:18.753
But that can be solved.

01:19:18.929 --> 01:19:22.464
You, my Cro-Magnon friend, are dead.
Your family's dead...

01:19:22.641 --> 01:19:24.219
...your past is dead.

01:19:24.643 --> 01:19:27.430
Dead things cannot affect the living. So...

01:19:27.771 --> 01:19:29.396
...enjoy your moment...

01:19:29.481 --> 01:19:33.431
...of prehistoric bravado because
after you leave here it will be over.

01:19:33.527 --> 01:19:35.934
Like everything else in your life.

01:19:36.154 --> 01:19:39.606
Officer, return this man
to cryo-stasis immediately.

01:19:40.158 --> 01:19:41.439
Be well.

01:19:42.828 --> 01:19:44.203
Be fucked.

01:19:44.997 --> 01:19:46.954
You are fined one credit--

01:19:52.129 --> 01:19:55.295
Greetings, Citizen.
How are you on this glorious day?

01:19:56.258 --> 01:19:57.586
I'll wait here.

01:19:57.717 --> 01:19:58.666
Let's go.

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:01.382
-I don't know.
-I do know. Turn that thing on.

01:20:01.471 --> 01:20:03.630
I hope you know what you're doing.

01:20:04.641 --> 01:20:07.132
You're asking me to disobey a direct order.

01:20:07.227 --> 01:20:09.219
I'm to escort you to the cryo-prison.

01:20:09.312 --> 01:20:13.310
I must get that maniac and put him
on ice or that's where I'll be.

01:20:13.525 --> 01:20:16.312
-Enhance your calm.
-I've had it with enhancing my calm.

01:20:16.403 --> 01:20:20.981
I'll enhance that psycho's calm.
Then I'll turn my attention to Cocteau.

01:20:22.534 --> 01:20:25.321
You don't have to come with me.
I can do it alone.

01:20:25.412 --> 01:20:29.243
Even if Phoenix was programmed
to escape, kill and steal...

01:20:29.874 --> 01:20:31.783
...why are you going to the wasteland?

01:20:31.876 --> 01:20:36.040
Your city-wide manhunt didn't work
because Phoenix was in a place...

01:20:36.214 --> 01:20:37.791
...you can't monitor...

01:20:37.882 --> 01:20:40.883
...afraid to go and don't give a shit about.

01:20:41.552 --> 01:20:45.681
I want to go down there, find Phoenix
and put him in a hurt locker.

01:20:47.058 --> 01:20:49.549
Do you want to come? Or arrest me?

01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:53.558
I'm with you.

01:20:54.190 --> 01:20:55.898
Let's go blow this guy.

01:20:58.361 --> 01:20:59.357
Away.

01:20:59.529 --> 01:21:01.320
Blow this guy away.

01:21:02.406 --> 01:21:03.521
Whatever.

01:21:10.039 --> 01:21:11.782
She has a way with words.

01:21:18.255 --> 01:21:19.335
What's wrong?

01:21:19.423 --> 01:21:21.215
It's not very clean.

01:21:25.888 --> 01:21:27.596
A real garden spot.

01:21:28.224 --> 01:21:29.766
Okay, which way?

01:21:30.059 --> 01:21:31.221
Over there.

01:21:31.435 --> 01:21:33.558
Okay, be ready for anything.

01:21:41.737 --> 01:21:44.062
"My dog's better than your dog

01:21:44.239 --> 01:21:46.398
"My dog's better than yours

01:21:46.617 --> 01:21:49.737
"My dog's better 'cause
he gets Kennel-Ration"

01:21:50.454 --> 01:21:52.910
I'm sorry, when I'm nervous, l....

01:21:53.415 --> 01:21:54.411
Sorry.

01:21:55.125 --> 01:21:56.501
Over here.

01:22:17.439 --> 01:22:19.348
What's that emanation?

01:22:24.154 --> 01:22:25.434
Come on.

01:22:34.289 --> 01:22:36.780
Relax. I just want a burger and a beer.

01:22:39.002 --> 01:22:40.330
How will I pay?

01:22:42.130 --> 01:22:43.790
It's better to give.

01:22:51.848 --> 01:22:53.011
Want a slug?

01:22:56.144 --> 01:22:57.472
No, thank you.

01:22:57.687 --> 01:22:59.514
I think I'll be sick.

01:22:59.814 --> 01:23:01.095
Oh, God.

01:23:01.524 --> 01:23:04.062
This is fantastic. You must try one.

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:06.851
Don't ask where the meat comes from.

01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:08.440
What do you mean?

01:23:08.531 --> 01:23:10.607
See any cows around here?

01:23:19.334 --> 01:23:20.329
Rat?

01:23:22.045 --> 01:23:23.622
This is a rat burger?

01:23:28.676 --> 01:23:29.874
Not bad.

01:23:31.345 --> 01:23:33.753
It's the best burger I've had in years.

01:23:36.517 --> 01:23:37.846
See you later.

01:24:01.041 --> 01:24:03.877
They don't seem very hostile,
John Spartan.

01:24:05.045 --> 01:24:06.374
No, they don't.

01:24:15.764 --> 01:24:18.053
Now that's a thing of beauty.

01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.685
Do you know what this is?

01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:23.679
A 1970 Oldsmobile 442.

01:24:26.734 --> 01:24:29.022
With a 455-cubic-inch engine.

01:24:30.404 --> 01:24:32.729
Radial tires and bucket seats.

01:24:34.116 --> 01:24:35.444
I'm impressed.

01:24:35.701 --> 01:24:36.815
I studied.

01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:39.401
So did l. Hand over the glow-rod.

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:41.738
Your friends too. Come on.

01:24:49.965 --> 01:24:52.372
You got balls, coming down here.

01:24:53.093 --> 01:24:55.216
We're looking for a MurderDeathKiller.

01:24:55.303 --> 01:24:58.803
Can you help us or just bully us
with your primitive weapons?

01:25:03.645 --> 01:25:05.685
Maybe they're not so primitive.

01:25:08.441 --> 01:25:10.066
You think you're taking me in?

01:25:10.151 --> 01:25:11.231
Guess what?

01:25:11.319 --> 01:25:12.564
Not happening.

01:25:12.779 --> 01:25:15.815
Tell Cocteau he can kiss my ass.
That's right.

01:25:16.157 --> 01:25:18.530
It'll take an army to get rid of me.

01:25:18.618 --> 01:25:20.907
I don't give a shit. I got nothing to lose.

01:25:20.996 --> 01:25:25.492
I don't know who the hell you are,
let alone want to take you anywhere.

01:25:26.001 --> 01:25:29.167
So stay here, be well
and Cocteau's an asshole!

01:25:30.296 --> 01:25:33.630
Let's dump them up top.
They're only here to spy on us.

01:25:34.801 --> 01:25:36.046
Wait a minute.

01:25:37.804 --> 01:25:40.010
You're the guy outside Pizza Hut.

01:25:41.766 --> 01:25:43.177
What do you want?

01:25:43.685 --> 01:25:46.140
You weren't part of the Cocteau plan.

01:25:46.312 --> 01:25:49.598
Greed, deception, abuse of power.
That's no plan.

01:25:52.151 --> 01:25:54.524
-That's why you're here?
-That's right.

01:25:54.696 --> 01:25:55.691
See....

01:25:56.155 --> 01:25:58.148
According to Cocteau's plan...

01:25:58.324 --> 01:26:00.815
...I'm an enemy because I like to think.

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:02.275
I like to read.

01:26:02.370 --> 01:26:04.244
I'm into freedom of speech and choice.

01:26:04.330 --> 01:26:05.955
I like to sit in a greasy spoon...

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:10.334
...and think, "Should I have steak
or barbecued ribs with gravy fries?"

01:26:10.545 --> 01:26:11.920
I want high cholesterol.

01:26:12.004 --> 01:26:14.495
I want to eat bacon, butter and cheese.

01:26:14.674 --> 01:26:17.425
I want to smoke a Cuban cigar
the size of Cincinnati.

01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:20.427
I want to run through the streets naked...

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:23.883
...reading Playboy magazine
because I might need to.

01:26:24.058 --> 01:26:25.600
I've seen the future.

01:26:25.685 --> 01:26:27.511
It's a 47-year-old virgin...

01:26:27.603 --> 01:26:30.639
...drinking a banana-broccoli shake
and singing "I'm a wiener."

01:26:30.731 --> 01:26:32.273
Up top, you live Cocteau's way.

01:26:32.358 --> 01:26:34.516
What he wants, when he wants,
how he wants.

01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:36.852
Your other choice: come here.

01:26:38.155 --> 01:26:39.733
Maybe starve to death.

01:26:40.533 --> 01:26:43.818
Why don't you take charge
and lead these people out of here?

01:26:43.911 --> 01:26:45.109
I'm no leader.

01:26:45.329 --> 01:26:47.156
I do what I have to do.

01:26:47.289 --> 01:26:48.867
Sometimes people join me.

01:26:48.958 --> 01:26:53.584
I just want to bury Cocteau up to his neck
in shit and let him think happy thoughts.

01:26:53.963 --> 01:26:55.789
Then I got bad news.

01:26:56.548 --> 01:26:58.755
I think he wants to kill you.

01:27:01.553 --> 01:27:04.009
All right gentlemen, let's review.

01:27:04.807 --> 01:27:06.182
The year is 2032.

01:27:07.017 --> 01:27:09.769
That's 2-0-3-2. As in the 21st century.

01:27:11.104 --> 01:27:15.268
And I'm sorry to say that
the world has become a pussy-whipped...

01:27:16.193 --> 01:27:20.356
...Brady Bunch version of itself
run by a bunch of robed sissies.

01:27:21.406 --> 01:27:24.193
All we have to do to run the whole thing...

01:27:24.326 --> 01:27:28.240
...is to kill a man named Friendly,
who put it all together.

01:27:29.498 --> 01:27:31.989
But there's an extra added bonus.

01:27:33.752 --> 01:27:35.246
We get to kill...

01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:37.745
...the man who put us in the freezer.

01:27:37.923 --> 01:27:39.085
You mean...

01:27:39.257 --> 01:27:41.001
...we get to kill John Spartan?

01:27:41.092 --> 01:27:42.255
Exactly.

01:27:42.594 --> 01:27:45.844
I want you to loot, pillage,
plunder, and steal.

01:27:46.181 --> 01:27:50.641
Do all the wonderful things we used to do
before any of this happened.

01:27:51.394 --> 01:27:53.434
This world will be ours!

01:27:53.647 --> 01:27:55.473
Let's bring back the good old days!

01:27:55.565 --> 01:27:56.940
Are you with me?

01:27:57.651 --> 01:27:59.773
Are you with me? Let's do it!

01:28:02.614 --> 01:28:06.742
It is a curious conclusion
which you have deduced, John Spartan.

01:28:07.619 --> 01:28:10.370
But I can find no fault in your logic.

01:28:10.497 --> 01:28:14.625
Phoenix is the perfect weapon to send
into these savage regions.

01:28:15.335 --> 01:28:17.292
I'm impressed, John Spartan.

01:28:17.503 --> 01:28:20.125
They thawed him out just to kill me?

01:28:21.215 --> 01:28:24.335
-I'm flattered.
-Don't be flattered. Be frightened.

01:28:24.594 --> 01:28:26.800
This guy's a certifiable nightmare.

01:28:26.971 --> 01:28:28.964
That's why you're here?

01:28:31.351 --> 01:28:34.933
I must have done something right
in the previous life.

01:28:35.438 --> 01:28:37.929
Can't imagine what that could have been.

01:28:39.901 --> 01:28:41.609
Two for the price of one.

01:28:41.861 --> 01:28:43.521
Let's take them.

01:28:48.492 --> 01:28:49.821
Stay down!

01:29:22.943 --> 01:29:25.861
I'll be damned.
Like a New York cockroach.

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:57.308
Everything's gone wrong.

01:30:13.827 --> 01:30:16.282
There's an elevator shaft at the top.

01:30:18.582 --> 01:30:20.124
So we're going up?

01:30:20.292 --> 01:30:22.865
Momentito, Senorita Huxley. Come on.

01:30:41.521 --> 01:30:44.226
How nice! Must've been expecting me.

01:31:01.165 --> 01:31:02.410
Now what?

01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:03.875
Buckle up.

01:31:27.316 --> 01:31:29.273
There he is! He's in my car!

01:31:35.324 --> 01:31:36.735
Goddamn it.

01:31:43.332 --> 01:31:45.490
What's happening to cops today?

01:31:45.584 --> 01:31:48.206
Don't you know
you are endangering civilians?

01:32:06.855 --> 01:32:07.721
Auto-inflate!

01:32:07.815 --> 01:32:09.143
Auto-inflate.

01:32:14.696 --> 01:32:15.811
That was lovely.

01:32:15.906 --> 01:32:17.400
Huxley, drive!

01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:20.322
Okay, I've read all about this.

01:32:22.913 --> 01:32:25.202
What do I do? Push this pedal?

01:32:27.626 --> 01:32:29.203
Okay, I got it.

01:32:38.762 --> 01:32:40.090
Punch it!

01:32:40.347 --> 01:32:41.426
Excuse me?

01:32:41.556 --> 01:32:44.047
Push the pedal as hard as you can!

01:32:55.654 --> 01:32:56.899
No free rides!

01:33:02.452 --> 01:33:04.030
Emergency, doors open.

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:05.365
Doors opening.

01:33:06.664 --> 01:33:08.372
Say hello to my friend.

01:33:20.637 --> 01:33:21.716
Doors close!

01:33:21.804 --> 01:33:22.967
Malfunction.

01:33:28.603 --> 01:33:30.477
Computer, auto-drive.

01:33:30.730 --> 01:33:32.438
Auto-drive engaged.

01:33:32.607 --> 01:33:34.516
Going to give you a haircut!

01:33:36.027 --> 01:33:38.185
Remember the 40 bus passengers...

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:40.687
...you blew up trying to get me?

01:33:42.075 --> 01:33:44.067
They were already dead.

01:33:44.535 --> 01:33:46.362
Cold as Haagen-Dazs!

01:33:54.462 --> 01:33:57.083
I went to jail with a 36-year smile.

01:33:58.299 --> 01:33:59.758
You're dead.

01:33:59.967 --> 01:34:01.759
Speak for yourself.

01:34:10.978 --> 01:34:11.927
Self-drive!

01:34:12.021 --> 01:34:13.764
Unable to execute.

01:34:14.064 --> 01:34:15.724
-Self-drive! Now!
-Malfunction.

01:34:15.816 --> 01:34:17.560
Unable to execute.

01:34:17.818 --> 01:34:18.981
Emergency!

01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:22.144
Brake!

01:34:23.490 --> 01:34:24.985
Self-drive engaged.

01:34:26.619 --> 01:34:28.161
Brake! Brake!

01:34:30.497 --> 01:34:33.451
Brake now, you,
Mickey Mouse piece of shit!

01:35:08.201 --> 01:35:09.909
Are you in there?

01:35:11.538 --> 01:35:13.696
Who do you think it is, Huxley?

01:35:21.923 --> 01:35:25.043
I thought your life force
had been prematurely terminated!

01:35:25.135 --> 01:35:27.377
I thought I was history too.

01:35:27.554 --> 01:35:31.302
What happened? All of a sudden,
this car turned into a cannoli.

01:35:31.558 --> 01:35:34.345
It's the curefoam. It saved your life.

01:35:34.561 --> 01:35:36.886
Look at you, you're in shambles.

01:35:37.188 --> 01:35:40.557
I can fix it later.
All I need is a needle and thread.

01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:42.810
Did I really say that?

01:35:52.745 --> 01:35:55.236
You caveman, you're under arrest!

01:35:55.832 --> 01:35:58.405
You're to be returned to the cryo-prison.
Immediately!

01:35:58.501 --> 01:36:01.206
I heard all that. We'll talk later, Chief.

01:36:02.463 --> 01:36:05.334
I need something. A shotgun, a flare gun.

01:36:08.928 --> 01:36:09.794
Shit!

01:36:09.971 --> 01:36:11.465
Defensive red alert!

01:36:13.182 --> 01:36:14.593
Stun batons on.

01:36:15.935 --> 01:36:17.133
Relax.

01:36:18.104 --> 01:36:19.931
Did you bump your noggin...

01:36:20.022 --> 01:36:22.181
...and think you're Pancho Villa?

01:36:22.692 --> 01:36:23.641
Who?

01:36:24.151 --> 01:36:25.017
Never mind.

01:36:25.111 --> 01:36:26.653
Time to take a stand.

01:36:26.737 --> 01:36:30.356
Good. While you're doing it,
loan me a gun. Two guns.

01:36:30.616 --> 01:36:34.530
You'd use these weapons against men
and women who uphold the law?

01:36:34.745 --> 01:36:37.616
We use these weapons
to shop for groceries, dick.

01:36:39.792 --> 01:36:41.167
You can't leave.

01:36:41.377 --> 01:36:46.086
You're under arrest. This very concept
negates the possibility of your leaving.

01:36:46.298 --> 01:36:47.876
Skip it, Chief.

01:36:48.342 --> 01:36:50.085
Lieutenant Huxley!

01:36:50.427 --> 01:36:51.459
Chief...

01:36:51.554 --> 01:36:54.720
...you can take this job
and you can shovel it.

01:36:57.268 --> 01:36:58.928
"Take this job...

01:36:59.144 --> 01:37:00.687
"...and shovel it."

01:37:02.314 --> 01:37:03.808
Close enough.

01:37:09.238 --> 01:37:13.567
I hadn't counted on this but I must say,
you worked out beautifully.

01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:16.569
People are terrified of you.

01:37:16.912 --> 01:37:19.747
What's new? People have always been
terrified of me.

01:37:19.832 --> 01:37:22.702
But this time they're really intimidated.

01:37:24.962 --> 01:37:26.160
Now...

01:37:26.463 --> 01:37:30.212
...I'll have carte blanche
to create the perfect society.

01:37:31.885 --> 01:37:33.296
My society.

01:37:34.221 --> 01:37:37.091
San Angeles will be a beacon of order...

01:37:37.891 --> 01:37:40.512
...with the purity of an ant colony.

01:37:41.353 --> 01:37:43.926
And the beauty of a flawless pearl.

01:37:44.773 --> 01:37:46.931
People have a right to be assholes.

01:37:49.402 --> 01:37:50.897
You remind me of...

01:37:51.655 --> 01:37:53.279
...an evil Mr. Rogers.

01:37:53.490 --> 01:37:55.067
Will you please kill him?

01:37:55.158 --> 01:37:56.700
He's pissing me off.

01:38:07.379 --> 01:38:09.537
Put another log on the fire!

01:38:11.132 --> 01:38:13.255
I'll love running this place!

01:38:20.517 --> 01:38:21.975
Well, now...

01:38:22.268 --> 01:38:24.510
...what shall I do with you?

01:38:26.231 --> 01:38:28.722
I am an excellent associate, sir.

01:38:29.317 --> 01:38:33.267
I'd be delighted to continue my services
during your administration.

01:38:34.447 --> 01:38:35.775
Maybe we'd use--

01:38:35.865 --> 01:38:37.905
Excuse me, the police are here.

01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:40.440
Oh, man!

01:39:06.479 --> 01:39:08.555
What the hell are you doing?

01:39:26.665 --> 01:39:28.041
I'm impressed.

01:39:41.597 --> 01:39:43.922
That man has died by my hands.

01:39:44.641 --> 01:39:46.349
It was either him or us.

01:39:47.811 --> 01:39:49.305
There is that.

01:39:49.521 --> 01:39:51.763
Where'd you learn to kick like that?

01:39:53.025 --> 01:39:54.816
Jackie Chan movies.

01:40:03.285 --> 01:40:06.239
Looks like the Cocteau plan
went up in smoke.

01:40:06.705 --> 01:40:09.077
Rest in peace, Raymond Cocteau.

01:40:10.083 --> 01:40:14.033
John Spartan, civilization as we know it
will come to an end.

01:40:15.088 --> 01:40:16.203
What will we do?

01:40:16.298 --> 01:40:18.871
I don't know. But this is better for you.

01:40:19.050 --> 01:40:20.509
What's that?

01:40:25.390 --> 01:40:26.849
This is bad.

01:40:27.142 --> 01:40:28.387
This is very bad.

01:40:28.476 --> 01:40:32.474
He's accessed the cryo-prison
and is about to defrost the multi-lifers.

01:40:32.606 --> 01:40:34.100
They don't like you.

01:40:34.274 --> 01:40:37.773
Most of these guys don't like
their own mothers. They're bad boys.

01:40:37.861 --> 01:40:39.319
How many are there?

01:40:42.532 --> 01:40:43.528
Eighty.

01:40:43.825 --> 01:40:45.236
All without rehab.

01:40:45.326 --> 01:40:47.284
They'll be re-animated within the hour.

01:40:47.370 --> 01:40:49.114
We must stop this.

01:40:50.999 --> 01:40:55.411
I'm not at all pleased about having caused
the fatality of a convict.

01:40:55.670 --> 01:40:59.881
I now understand that under certain
circumstances violence is necessary.

01:41:00.091 --> 01:41:01.254
Good.

01:41:05.972 --> 01:41:08.130
I hope you understand this.

01:41:17.108 --> 01:41:19.433
I hope my butt didn't look like that.

01:41:19.610 --> 01:41:22.362
Okay, who do we have left that's good?

01:41:22.530 --> 01:41:23.693
Let's see...

01:41:23.823 --> 01:41:25.317
...Foulks, Patrick.

01:41:25.491 --> 01:41:27.982
Jeffrey Dahmer? I love that guy.

01:41:29.078 --> 01:41:30.786
How long before the rest are done?

01:41:30.872 --> 01:41:32.864
They're in the final stages of reanimation.

01:41:32.957 --> 01:41:34.784
Great. Absolutely great.

01:41:36.586 --> 01:41:37.700
Gentlemen!

01:41:38.254 --> 01:41:41.705
Thank you, but your services
are no longer required.

01:41:48.806 --> 01:41:51.214
Send a maniac to catch a maniac.

01:42:09.410 --> 01:42:10.738
Attention.

01:42:10.911 --> 01:42:12.286
Attention.

01:42:12.371 --> 01:42:15.158
Cryo-prisoner defrosting
re-animation sequence...

01:42:15.249 --> 01:42:17.491
...now entering final stage.

01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:22.539
Count down to reanimation
of prisoner batches...

01:42:22.756 --> 01:42:24.548
...290, 310, 480...

01:42:26.844 --> 01:42:28.089
...570.

01:42:28.428 --> 01:42:29.839
Ten minutes.

01:42:31.932 --> 01:42:34.601
-That's it. The very last one.
-Excellent.

01:42:36.061 --> 01:42:37.389
Accessed.

01:42:39.106 --> 01:42:40.849
What the hell is that?

01:43:17.435 --> 01:43:19.558
Didn't expect that, did you?

01:43:19.938 --> 01:43:21.349
Where are you going?

01:43:21.439 --> 01:43:23.348
I wish you the best of luck.

01:43:24.359 --> 01:43:25.355
Stupid.

01:43:33.076 --> 01:43:34.784
How's it hanging?

01:43:36.371 --> 01:43:39.490
I'm sure you're familiar
with the long arm of the law.

01:43:44.504 --> 01:43:47.588
Why don't you struggle a little bit?
Make me work for it!

01:43:47.673 --> 01:43:49.547
What do you say? How about...

01:43:49.634 --> 01:43:52.718
...a little target practice. What do you say?

01:44:00.937 --> 01:44:02.645
Did that hurt your head?

01:44:22.958 --> 01:44:24.536
Shit! Goddamn!

01:44:32.134 --> 01:44:33.048
Fuck!

01:44:45.147 --> 01:44:46.522
That's it!

01:44:47.066 --> 01:44:49.272
You won't get out of this one!

01:44:52.279 --> 01:44:54.900
I'll drop you in that vat of defrost...

01:44:55.073 --> 01:44:57.150
...and fry you like a chicken...

01:44:58.368 --> 01:45:01.453
...or with my little pinky,
drop your monkey ass--

01:45:04.082 --> 01:45:05.660
I'll be damned.

01:45:47.042 --> 01:45:48.322
Shit! Goddamn!

01:45:48.585 --> 01:45:49.581
What am I doing wrong?

01:45:49.794 --> 01:45:51.621
Cryo-prisoner re-animation...

01:45:51.755 --> 01:45:54.459
...sequence now entering final stage.

01:46:01.139 --> 01:46:03.844
"ls it cold in here, or is it just me?"

01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:07.019
Good memory.

01:46:13.359 --> 01:46:14.640
Come here!

01:46:15.069 --> 01:46:16.232
Shit!

01:46:27.081 --> 01:46:28.540
I hate cops!

01:46:32.879 --> 01:46:35.452
Look into my eyes. I'll see you in hell.

01:46:35.882 --> 01:46:36.830
Not.

01:47:20.050 --> 01:47:22.458
This is the best day of my life.

01:47:52.916 --> 01:47:54.244
Heads up!

01:48:45.218 --> 01:48:49.132
Did you apprehend the villain responsible
for murdering Cocteau?

01:48:49.347 --> 01:48:51.221
I wouldn't say "apprehend."

01:48:51.391 --> 01:48:52.885
But he's history.

01:48:53.142 --> 01:48:54.767
And the cryo-prison...

01:48:54.894 --> 01:48:56.353
...is history too.

01:48:59.315 --> 01:49:00.857
What'll we do?

01:49:01.818 --> 01:49:02.932
How will we live?

01:49:03.027 --> 01:49:06.776
We'll go out drinking,
get shit-faced and paint the town.

01:49:07.073 --> 01:49:09.279
Graffiti slogans, it'll be a blast.

01:49:09.784 --> 01:49:11.242
This is what you'll do.

01:49:11.327 --> 01:49:13.236
You'll get a little dirty...

01:49:13.329 --> 01:49:15.072
...you, a lot clean.

01:49:15.289 --> 01:49:17.412
And somewhere in the middle....

01:49:18.209 --> 01:49:20.082
You'll figure it out.

01:49:20.419 --> 01:49:21.617
Fucking-A!

01:49:24.799 --> 01:49:26.079
Well put.

01:49:27.676 --> 01:49:29.799
Greetings and salutations.

01:49:29.970 --> 01:49:32.343
I'm Associate Bob. And may I say...

01:49:32.515 --> 01:49:35.930
...it would be a pleasure
to help you create a more humane--

01:49:37.186 --> 01:49:38.929
Let's talk about the hair, okay?

01:49:39.021 --> 01:49:42.722
Pick a color. And lose the kimono.
You look like a couch.

01:49:42.858 --> 01:49:45.396
What are you, a surgeon
with these gloves?

01:49:49.406 --> 01:49:52.028
Thanks for rendering me unconscious.

01:49:54.036 --> 01:49:55.495
I did it for your own good.

01:49:55.579 --> 01:49:57.904
-We're supposed to be a team.
-We are.

01:50:06.882 --> 01:50:08.127
Oh, my.

01:50:08.926 --> 01:50:11.630
Are all fluid transfer activities like this?

01:50:11.762 --> 01:50:13.422
-Better.
-Better?

01:50:14.681 --> 01:50:15.879
Oh, my.

01:50:19.311 --> 01:50:21.303
I think I'll like the future.

01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:23.852
Now that you've demolished everything.

01:50:24.399 --> 01:50:26.724
But there's one thing I want to know.

01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:29.777
How's that damn
three-seashell thing work?

01:50:30.305 --> 01:50:36.264
