WEBVTT

00:13.222 --> 00:14.306
Like, right here?

00:15.390 --> 00:16.350
No. Move, move.

00:16.433 --> 00:20.187
Everything you always wanted to know
about the party but were afraid to ask.

00:20.270 --> 00:24.024
Question: Ike, you never write.
Why are you writing to me?

00:24.107 --> 00:26.652
Answer: To save the date.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.737
Question: What date?

00:28.820 --> 00:32.031
Answer: Saturday, July 6, 1991.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.410
Question: What am I saving it for?

00:35.494 --> 00:37.788
Answer: A summer party.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.541
Question: What should I wear?

00:40.999 --> 00:43.752
Answer: The party is safari themed,

00:43.836 --> 00:46.672
so dress like
the wild exotic animal that you are.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.842
Question: But how will I get there?

00:50.551 --> 00:54.137
Answer: Meet on the southwest corner
of 40th and 8th Avenue.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.806
Don't worry about the ride home.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.934
You'll be dropped off
at the very same spot at 10:00 p.m.,

00:59.017 --> 01:00.602
tanned, tired and tipsy.

01:00.686 --> 01:03.021
-This is the bus to Ike's party?
-It sure is.

01:03.105 --> 01:04.105
Okay, yeah.

01:04.188 --> 01:06.191
Question:
What are we gonna do at the party?

01:06.275 --> 01:07.943
Answer: What aren't we going to do?

01:08.026 --> 01:09.653
There'll be swimming, chicken fights,

01:09.736 --> 01:12.239
Ping-Pong, lawn darts, croquet, limbo

01:12.322 --> 01:13.657
and so much more.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.325
See you soon.

01:39.641 --> 01:42.394
Marty, what is that odor
that smells like shit

01:42.477 --> 01:43.478
by the lounge chairs?

01:43.562 --> 01:47.649
Well, it is what it smells like.
I think the septic tank is backed up.

01:47.733 --> 01:50.068
Can you do something about it, please?

01:50.152 --> 01:51.403
I know it's a safari party,

01:51.486 --> 01:53.238
but I don't want it to smell
like elephant dung.

01:53.322 --> 01:55.490
-Okay.
-Not so fast.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.868
Seriously, Bonnie? Two-pieces?

01:57.951 --> 02:00.287
They're children. This isn't Cambodia.

02:00.871 --> 02:03.290
-Can you go change, please?
-Come on, girls. Come on.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.374
Hold on. Wait.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.335
Is that what you're wearing?

02:06.418 --> 02:08.461
Yeah. Is it too much?

02:09.338 --> 02:11.423
It's fine. It's fine.
Just put them in dresses.

02:11.507 --> 02:12.508
Okay.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.343
Dr. Ike, everything okay?

02:14.426 --> 02:16.720
Yeah, I'm just--

02:17.846 --> 02:20.224
What if this party
isn't as fun as Stephen Baldwin's?

02:20.307 --> 02:21.934
Stephen Baldwin put on a party

02:22.017 --> 02:24.311
that people are gonna talk about
for a long time.

02:24.394 --> 02:25.729
That's a given.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.982
However, look at this attention to detail.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.567
This is gonna be a great party.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.319
I don't know.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.071
What if no one shows

02:34.154 --> 02:37.574
and it's just you and me
and a hundred pounds of chopped meat?

02:37.658 --> 02:39.326
Still sounds fun to me.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.670
Let the good times roll! Welcome!

02:49.753 --> 02:52.297
-You are the man.
-No, you. Stop it. Stop it.

02:52.381 --> 02:53.507
-How are you?
-Hey, Ike.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.591
-What's up, David?
-Ike.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.260
-Hi, Miriam.
-Ike.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.011
So happy you made it. I love your hat.

02:58.095 --> 03:00.472
Yeah.
Oh. I have something for you.

03:00.556 --> 03:03.517
-Party time.
-Thank you so much. Hey!

03:04.184 --> 03:06.854
You know, this is the same strength
as my mother's reading glasses.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.106
-Do you have them in a bifocal?
-Yeah.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.275
-Get in there, Miriam. Have fun.
-Okay.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.901
Hi, Iz. How are you?

03:12.985 --> 03:15.445
By the way, we're putting in a hot tub
right over here.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.656
We have porcelain tile flying in
from Murano.

03:17.739 --> 03:20.075
The Italians, they do it so much better.
Am I right?

03:20.158 --> 03:21.493
We bought the place next door too.

03:21.577 --> 03:23.036
We're totally refurbishing.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.330
Putting in a golf course, a tennis court

03:25.414 --> 03:27.291
and a sundial.

03:27.374 --> 03:30.294
-You and Bonnie have real vision.
-You know Bonnie. She loves a project.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.712
It's why she married me.

03:33.005 --> 03:35.174
Thank you for coming.
It's great to see you.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.468
Let's touch base on Monday.

03:39.094 --> 03:41.638
There may be a spot opening up
on the synagogue board

03:41.722 --> 03:43.473
that I think you'd be perfect for.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.311
-Yep.
-All right.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.481
Marty.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.649
We're a hit.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.027
I think people are having a great time.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.153
What a team we make, huh?

03:56.236 --> 03:59.323
I was thinking I should put some dip out.
I forgot all about dip.

03:59.406 --> 04:00.532
Who doesn't love dip?

04:01.116 --> 04:03.243
But I don't want you cooking all day.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.954
You know,
I want you to relax and enjoy yourself.

04:06.038 --> 04:07.289
I like cooking. Cooking is good.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.166
Whatever you say, chief.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.709
By the way.

04:10.792 --> 04:11.877
I was thinking.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.296
Maybe I can put the
barbecue back a bit

04:14.379 --> 04:16.130
and give you a little more room.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.257
I don't want people
breathing down your neck.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.344
They can't be disturbing
the genius at work.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.930
No. It's a good idea.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.515
Yeah, a little space.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.267
Okay. I'm gonna make sure
everyone's good on drinks.

04:27.351 --> 04:29.561
And I said,
"I don't care if it is before Labor Day.

04:29.645 --> 04:32.147
You'll never see these legs
in white pants."

04:34.816 --> 04:36.944
-There you go.
-Thanks.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.074
That was way out.

04:42.866 --> 04:45.035
-Hey!
-Hi, Ike!

04:46.245 --> 04:48.247
-What?
-Nothing.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.748
-Do you need me?
-No.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.418
Hey!

05:17.276 --> 05:19.736
If you let them walk all over you,
you know what they're gonna do.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.572
-Walk all over me. Yeah.
-That's right.

05:21.655 --> 05:25.450
This "buy a cake for their birthday"
tradition has gotten out of hand.

05:25.534 --> 05:26.994
Did you hear Cathy?

05:27.077 --> 05:29.079
"Red velvet for me. Red velvet."

05:29.162 --> 05:30.414
Please, you know.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.374
You're not running a bakery, Marty.
It's a business.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.335
No, I know, I know. Cathy can get
outta control with that stuff.

05:39.381 --> 05:40.382
So…

05:41.967 --> 05:43.135
That was pretty epic, huh?

05:45.095 --> 05:46.805
-What was epic?
-The party, Marty.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.390
-Oh. Yeah.
-Yeah?

05:48.473 --> 05:50.434
Right, I mean, it was a lot of work.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.104
-But yeah.
-We should fix the lighting by the pool.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.939
Man, by eight o'clock, it was pitch black.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.941
I feel like I tore my rotator cuff

05:58.025 --> 06:00.485
schlepping all those wet towels
to and from the dryer.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.196
People loved the pool. They loved it.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.031
I opened so many bottles of soda pop,

06:04.114 --> 06:06.366
I haven't been able to make
a solid fist.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.744
You know, we could hang
string lights the next time.

06:08.827 --> 06:09.953
Next time?

06:12.122 --> 06:13.957
-There's gonna be a next time?
-Of course.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.376
We're just getting started.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.129
Marty.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.298
These parties are great for us.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.967
They're great for business.
They're great for networking.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.804
Why? You didn't enjoy it?

06:27.888 --> 06:29.097
No, I liked it. Yeah.

06:29.181 --> 06:30.516
It was good. Yeah, I guess.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.101
What is it? What's bothering you?

06:33.185 --> 06:35.229
I'm not much of a party guy.

06:35.729 --> 06:39.399
I didn't know anyone there.
I didn't know what to say to anyone.

06:39.483 --> 06:42.653
I think this is a narrative
you tell yourself.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.029
I've seen you party, Marty.

06:44.112 --> 06:47.241
And I don't know how to tell you this,
but you're pretty fun.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.077
No. No, I'm not fun.

06:51.870 --> 06:54.373
All right, well, I have an idea.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.291
Why don't we run it back?

06:56.375 --> 06:57.668
We'll have a second party,

06:57.751 --> 07:01.839
and we can use it as an opportunity
for you to make some connections.

07:03.257 --> 07:06.218
There were some fantastic people there,
Marty. Fantastic.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.095
I'm just too shy.

07:08.178 --> 07:11.390
-Oh, stop it already with the "shy."
-And-- No.

07:11.473 --> 07:14.351
I'm going to help you
learn to enjoy yourself.

07:16.854 --> 07:18.564
Okay? How's that sound?

07:19.565 --> 07:21.817
What is that shake?

07:21.900 --> 07:23.485
-All right.
-Yeah?

07:23.569 --> 07:25.904
-Yes. Yeah.
-All right. Okay. Good.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.866
By the way,

07:28.949 --> 07:30.242
I got you a little something.

07:35.747 --> 07:36.915
Wow.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.085
-A fish.
-A koi to be exact.

07:40.169 --> 07:42.296
-Well, thank you.
-You're welcome.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.383
-What do I do with it?
-I'm sure you'll figure it out.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.096
I guess we could build a pond.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.431
You know, in the Hamptons.

07:53.015 --> 07:56.643
That's a great idea. That is a great idea.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.979
That might be a good project for you.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.856
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.192
Well, okay.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.986
-He's looking right at me.
-He is. I think he likes you.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.988
Yeah. I hope so.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.277
Okay, play nice, guys.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.029
Adam, behave yourself.

09:09.091 --> 09:10.884
Take it easy with the cervezas.

09:10.968 --> 09:13.679
Sorry. I'm kidding.
Enjoy the fiesta, amigos.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.640
-Gracias. Gracias.
-Oh, yeah.

09:17.099 --> 09:18.892
Miriam. I see you've met Noreen.

09:18.976 --> 09:20.143
Yes. Yes.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.856
Terrific. Well, as they say in Oaxaca…

09:23.939 --> 09:25.232
Lehayim.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.358
Cheers.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.822
I see our chef is hard at work.

09:32.656 --> 09:33.699
Oh, yeah.

09:34.366 --> 09:35.784
He seems nice.

09:35.868 --> 09:37.077
Oh, Marty.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.496
He's a little shy, but…

09:41.540 --> 09:45.711
Well, don't let me hold you back.
If you, you know, would like to…

09:45.794 --> 09:48.172
Yeah, I'll go talk to him.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.423
Okay.

09:53.177 --> 09:57.055
-The grill master himself.
-Who? Me?

09:58.682 --> 10:01.435
-Miriam.
-Oh, right. Of course.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.645
-Yeah. From shiva.
-Yes.

10:03.729 --> 10:06.982
-And Ike's waiting room, right?
-That too.

10:07.691 --> 10:10.110
Well, Ike said that you are the best cook.

10:10.194 --> 10:13.488
I'm gonna need that kebab recipe
one of these days.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.991
Well, the trick is
to oil the skewers first.

10:16.617 --> 10:19.494
Then the meat cooks from the inside out.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.038
I'm boring myself now.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.998
No! No, no. No.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.125
Interesting.

10:27.002 --> 10:30.005
So, did you tell your mother no
about Florida?

10:31.965 --> 10:34.718
Wow, you have a great memory.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.429
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have--

10:37.513 --> 10:39.097
No! No, no, no. No, it's fine.

10:39.181 --> 10:41.099
There's a few of us here, right?

10:42.518 --> 10:44.311
-Have you met Jennifer?
-No.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.604
She's some kind of heiress.

10:45.687 --> 10:48.023
On the board of the New York City Ballet.
That kind of thing.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.359
Anyway, she's been with Ike forever.

10:50.442 --> 10:53.654
You must also know about
one of Ike's movie-star patients?

10:53.737 --> 10:55.113
I don't think so.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.741
-Okay, I shouldn't say.
-Okay.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.576
Her name rhymes with "Myneth Maltrow."

10:59.660 --> 11:02.454
He did mention that, yes.

11:02.538 --> 11:05.123
-It's quite a tribe, I guess.
-Yeah, yeah.

11:07.793 --> 11:09.795
I should get another tray.

11:11.755 --> 11:14.883
Now I know how Julia Childs feels.

11:14.967 --> 11:17.219
Minus the funny accent and the…

11:17.302 --> 11:18.762
the fulsome breasts.

11:22.599 --> 11:27.020
Who would have known that
the lamb kebabs are the number one hit?

11:28.188 --> 11:31.108
I think it's the cilantro I put on it.

11:33.110 --> 11:36.071
Sorry. Do you know
where the bathroom is?

11:36.154 --> 11:38.073
Yes, absolutely.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.784
It's down the hall,
second door on your left.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.452
It's a slow flush.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.496
Thank you for the heads-up.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.625
Is that Farrah Fawcett?

11:48.709 --> 11:50.502
It is. Cool, right?

11:50.586 --> 11:52.337
He met her on a flight to Tampa.

11:52.421 --> 11:54.631
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah, she's very lovely.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.342
Oh, my gosh.

11:57.426 --> 11:59.803
Ike was such a sweet little boy.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.639
Actually, that's me.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.641
With my parents and sister.

12:04.725 --> 12:05.809
Really?

12:07.311 --> 12:08.645
So, you knew Ike as a kid.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.191
So you two are related.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.442
Not exactly.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.153
But…

12:16.236 --> 12:18.822
You live here with Ike and Bonnie?

12:18.906 --> 12:21.366
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

12:21.450 --> 12:24.786
It is such a great home.

12:24.870 --> 12:27.331
How long have the Herschkopfs had it?
Do you know?

12:27.414 --> 12:31.043
Well, truth be told,

12:31.126 --> 12:34.922
it's my family's home
since the '50s, I guess.

12:35.005 --> 12:37.174
Yeah. A lot of happy memories.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.510
-Your family.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.136
Wait. This is your home?

12:42.012 --> 12:43.847
Well, I mean, it's our home.

12:44.723 --> 12:46.850
Yeah, there's a name on the paper.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.852
But you know, it still takes
that special someone

12:48.936 --> 12:50.437
to figure out what it could be,

12:50.521 --> 12:52.606
and that's Ike… and Bonnie.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.359
I'm just good at executing ideas.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.986
So it's a real team effort.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.450
-Yeah.
-But that's interesting.

13:04.618 --> 13:06.537
-The left, second door?
-Yeah, left, second door.

13:06.620 --> 13:09.623
-Okay. You got it.
-Keep your hand on the lever.

13:22.845 --> 13:23.887
So…

13:25.556 --> 13:27.015
can I ask you a question?

13:27.683 --> 13:28.809
Absolutely.

13:39.278 --> 13:40.696
Why…

13:42.155 --> 13:46.159
…did you go out of your way to tell Noreen
that the Hampton property was yours?

13:46.243 --> 13:47.244
What?

13:48.871 --> 13:50.622
No, I don't know--

13:51.290 --> 13:52.499
I don't know who Noreen is.

13:52.583 --> 13:53.667
She was at the party.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.711
The zaftig redhead.

13:56.879 --> 13:59.506
I don't remember saying that to anyone.

14:00.674 --> 14:03.760
Well, you did. She told me.

14:04.636 --> 14:08.056
But what I'm interested in is
why you said it.

14:08.140 --> 14:10.851
Honestly, I don't recall saying that
to anyone.

14:10.934 --> 14:15.480
I'm a little disappointed to hear that
because I now know that you're lying.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.400
Noreen recorded the conversation.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.361
She did?

14:22.404 --> 14:24.156
Of course she didn't.

14:24.239 --> 14:27.242
What's going on with your self-esteem,
Marty?

14:28.118 --> 14:29.828
Why the need to claim things?

14:29.912 --> 14:32.372
It's unbecoming.

14:32.456 --> 14:37.920
What you think you need to make you
look big is in fact making you look small.

14:38.003 --> 14:40.547
Now, Noreen,
she doesn't know what to think.

14:40.631 --> 14:42.090
And she's worried.

14:42.633 --> 14:44.176
She's worried that you're confused.

14:44.259 --> 14:45.469
So are Bonnie and I.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.930
I'm not,
and I didn't mean to confuse anyone.

14:48.013 --> 14:50.307
I'm just-- I'm so…

14:50.390 --> 14:52.100
…baffled.

14:52.184 --> 14:54.603
It's baffling to me, Marty.

14:54.686 --> 14:58.190
I mean, why on earth
would you say something like that?

14:58.273 --> 14:59.274
Honestly.

14:59.858 --> 15:01.777
It's my idea to host these parties, right?

15:01.860 --> 15:03.153
Yeah.

15:03.237 --> 15:07.157
I come up with the themes.
I write the invitations.

15:07.241 --> 15:09.034
-I am the host.
-You are.

15:10.202 --> 15:12.579
People come to enjoy themselves.

15:12.663 --> 15:15.374
To have fun and relax.

15:15.457 --> 15:19.503
-Not be confronted by your… pathologies.
-I'm sorry.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.089
I mean, what's the big deal
if they think it's my place?

15:22.172 --> 15:23.632
I mean, who cares whose place it is?

15:23.715 --> 15:24.716
I agree. Totally.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.094
In fact,
I said to Noreen afterwards that--

15:27.177 --> 15:30.138
Do you want people to come to our parties
and enjoy themselves,

15:30.222 --> 15:31.890
or do you want them to feel uncomfortable?

15:31.974 --> 15:34.434
No, I want--
I want them to enjoy themselves.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.771
Do you want to invite people
to take advantage of you?

15:37.855 --> 15:40.065
Like Debbie did?

15:40.148 --> 15:41.316
Like Phyllis did?

15:41.817 --> 15:43.861
Cathy, to a certain extent?

15:43.944 --> 15:45.320
No. Of course not.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.447
I didn't think so.

15:49.908 --> 15:51.410
You know I'm doing this for you.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.955
To protect you.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.332
We don't care.

15:57.416 --> 15:59.877
But… we're looking out for you.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.712
I know. I know.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.673
So just try not to say
those kinds of things, okay?

16:04.756 --> 16:05.966
Okay.

16:07.259 --> 16:09.136
Again, I'm so sorry.

16:09.219 --> 16:11.722
And please, tell Bonnie I'm sorry too.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.974
Marty, I would. I would.

16:14.057 --> 16:17.186
But I'm afraid
if I bring it up to Bonnie,

16:17.269 --> 16:19.938
she's just going to get upset
all over again.

16:26.695 --> 16:27.821
Now…

16:30.157 --> 16:31.992
you know what I'm thinking
for our next theme?

16:34.036 --> 16:35.954
Who's ready to walk the plank?

16:36.038 --> 16:37.831
-Aye!
-Amazing.

16:37.915 --> 16:39.833
-Ahoy, Captain.
-Right this way, mate.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.963
You get stage fright now?

16:45.047 --> 16:48.217
-"Shiver me timbers." You wanna say it?
-You got something to say?

16:48.300 --> 16:53.764
-No, he was saying it all morning. No…
-I think he's gonna do it this time.

16:53.847 --> 16:57.851
You need to change your batteries.
Yeah, you need to change your batteries.

16:57.935 --> 16:59.978
"Shiver me timbers."

17:00.062 --> 17:01.438
I don't think it's happening.

17:09.488 --> 17:11.531
-More food.
-I've had enough.

17:11.615 --> 17:14.992
-No, I meant for the guests.
-I know what you meant.

17:16.578 --> 17:17.954
You okay?

17:18.497 --> 17:20.832
You want some water or seltzer?

17:20.915 --> 17:22.626
I miss my husband.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.628
Let me get you a seltzer.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.257
-Remind me. Perrier or Pellegrino?
-I'm okay.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.926
I got both.
I'll just get you a Perrier. Yeah.

17:31.009 --> 17:33.595
Think I read somewhere
that it has less sodium.

17:33.679 --> 17:36.557
And this may sound crazy,
but when I drink Pellegrino,

17:36.640 --> 17:39.768
I think it sometimes makes me thirstier,
if you can believe that.

17:39.852 --> 17:42.229
-There you go.
-Thank you.

17:43.188 --> 17:45.732
Do you remember the first time
we all came here together?

17:45.816 --> 17:48.318
Just us? It was so nice.

17:48.402 --> 17:49.611
It was peaceful.

17:51.780 --> 17:52.823
I do.

17:53.615 --> 17:56.118
Yeah, it was.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.497
It's okay.

18:00.581 --> 18:01.999
I'm sorry.

18:02.082 --> 18:05.544
No. It's okay. It's all right. Yeah.

18:05.627 --> 18:06.920
Okay.

18:07.004 --> 18:11.049
Okay, I probably--
I think I should, you know, go back

18:11.133 --> 18:12.885
and bring out the extra kebabs.

18:12.968 --> 18:14.720
-Yeah. Okay.
-People are waiting.

18:14.803 --> 18:16.722
-Sorry, Marty.
-No, no, no.

18:17.514 --> 18:19.183
There's also soft drinks in here.

18:20.809 --> 18:22.978
-Okay.Thank you.
-Okay.

18:45.584 --> 18:48.045
-Pool volleyball?
-Ike, it's too cold.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.130
You don't happen to have
another towel, do you?

18:50.214 --> 18:52.382
Or, maybe, I don't know,
like, a light blanket?

18:52.966 --> 18:57.429
You-- No-- I'll ask Bonnie.

18:59.556 --> 19:02.100
Hey, Ike.
What time's the bus leaving tonight?

19:03.268 --> 19:04.102
I'm kinda done.

19:04.186 --> 19:07.689
Arthur, have a drink. It's a party.

19:08.607 --> 19:10.734
What the hell.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.736
I'll take an English breakfast tea.

19:12.819 --> 19:13.820
Tea?

19:15.030 --> 19:16.323
Anything in it?

19:16.865 --> 19:18.951
Little steamed milk would be nice.

19:21.912 --> 19:23.705
pH level is good.

19:24.915 --> 19:26.208
Here we are.

19:27.584 --> 19:28.627
Here we go.

19:29.503 --> 19:32.548
All right. Yes. Enough for everyone.

19:32.631 --> 19:34.967
Oh, come on, bud. You gotta share.

19:35.050 --> 19:36.218
Stop that.

19:37.427 --> 19:38.720
There you are.

19:38.804 --> 19:43.475
Looks like your Ichthyophthirius
multifiliis is finally clearing up.

19:43.559 --> 19:46.520
Those formula drops are working. Attaboy.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.147
Look at you. Your scales are so lush.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.858
Who are you talking to?

19:50.941 --> 19:52.651
Oh, you scared me.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.778
You're talking to the fish?

19:56.613 --> 19:57.865
Yeah, I guess.

20:00.492 --> 20:01.785
Hey, guess who…

20:03.078 --> 20:05.831
Guess who's nominated
to be vice president of the temple.

20:06.915 --> 20:09.418
Wow, congratulations.

20:09.501 --> 20:11.378
Why don't you come back to the party?

20:12.004 --> 20:14.173
Michael's friend from Los Angeles
is gonna tell us

20:14.256 --> 20:17.217
about the time he went hiking
with Craig T. Nelson from Coach.

20:17.301 --> 20:18.969
Oh, yeah, from Coach. Yeah.

20:19.803 --> 20:23.056
No, yeah, I'll be back soon.
I gotta flip the kebabs anyway.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.898
You know, Marty,

20:32.024 --> 20:34.484
these parties are for us.

20:34.568 --> 20:35.694
For both of us.

20:36.445 --> 20:41.700
I can't have fun
if you're not right by my side.

20:44.620 --> 20:46.455
Not that this is much of a party anyway.

20:49.958 --> 20:51.168
Here.

20:51.251 --> 20:52.794
No, thanks.

20:52.878 --> 20:55.047
My reflux is acting up.

20:55.130 --> 20:57.007
Oh, come on. It's one beer.

20:57.883 --> 20:58.884
To us.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.345
Okay.

21:07.643 --> 21:09.645
-Refreshing.
-Come on. Drink it.

21:09.728 --> 21:12.606
-Give it a real sip.
-That was a real sip.

21:12.689 --> 21:15.192
No, come on. We need to see Party Marty.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.276
The crowd wants it.

21:16.360 --> 21:19.279
Party Marty has a migraine, okay?
I think it's from the sun.

21:21.615 --> 21:23.534
You know this is part of our work, Marty.

21:23.617 --> 21:26.245
I want you to be free.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.788
I want you to fly.

21:31.166 --> 21:32.835
There we go. Oh, yes.

21:32.918 --> 21:35.587
Party Marty. Party Marty!

21:35.671 --> 21:39.383
Yes! Yes! There he is!

21:39.466 --> 21:41.426
There we go.

21:42.803 --> 21:43.804
Oh, my God.

21:43.887 --> 21:46.807
-That is fantastic. Here.
-What?

21:46.890 --> 21:50.561
Now you can enjoy yourself.
Now you can loosen up, be free.

21:52.271 --> 21:54.731
Look at this place.

21:55.315 --> 21:57.776
You know what I think would
get this party really started?

21:57.860 --> 21:59.820
-What?
-If everyone started jumping in the pool

21:59.903 --> 22:00.904
with their clothes on.

22:00.988 --> 22:03.407
Could you imagine?

22:03.490 --> 22:06.410
-That would be-- Yeah.
-You should start it.

22:06.493 --> 22:07.578
-Me?
-Yeah!

22:07.661 --> 22:10.289
-I don't know. No.
-I do! I do.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.082
Come here. Look at Miriam.

22:15.669 --> 22:17.671
You know, you should just go nudge her in.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.591
-Why-- Into the pool?
-She would love it.

22:20.674 --> 22:23.093
-She's such a prankster.
-Really? I didn't know that.

22:23.177 --> 22:26.972
If you only knew some of
the high jinks she's been a part of…

22:27.055 --> 22:28.557
She likes high jinks, huh?

22:28.640 --> 22:31.143
She will think it's hilarious.
She loves you.

22:32.060 --> 22:34.730
Party Marty. Party Marty.

22:34.813 --> 22:38.400
Party Marty. Party Mar--

22:44.948 --> 22:46.158
Hey, Miriam.

22:46.241 --> 22:47.534
Oh, hey, Marty.

22:47.618 --> 22:49.620
Wow, where have you been?

22:57.461 --> 22:59.046
What the fuck are you doing?

22:59.129 --> 23:00.839
I'm sorry.

23:00.923 --> 23:02.716
I thought it would be funny!

23:02.799 --> 23:04.426
Why would this be funny, Marty?

23:04.510 --> 23:06.553
-That was crazy.
-The fuck is wrong with you?

23:07.554 --> 23:09.056
-Are you all right?
-No.

23:12.684 --> 23:14.394
Are you insane? You--

23:15.187 --> 23:16.980
Guess I just got carried away.

23:17.648 --> 23:19.650
Ike gave me a bunch of beers.

23:19.733 --> 23:21.527
Well-- Wait, Marty, no.

23:21.610 --> 23:24.279
What I said was it would be fun
if everyone went swimming.

23:24.363 --> 23:26.323
I didn't say to body check her.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.825
Look, I'm very sorry.
He misread the situation.

23:28.909 --> 23:32.204
I normally don't drink, you know?
All that alcohol.

23:32.287 --> 23:34.623
Well, guess what, Marty.
I got news for you.

23:34.706 --> 23:37.334
You're okay. That beer was nonalcoholic.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.002
-What?
-Yeah.

23:39.545 --> 23:43.090
Why would you?
Why would you--

23:43.173 --> 23:47.386
Because Party Marty is in here.
You just need to let go.

23:47.469 --> 23:50.848
Now, admittedly,
this was a little over-the-top.

23:50.931 --> 23:53.684
Yeah, it's a work in progress.
Why don't you take care of her?

23:56.645 --> 24:00.315
It's a party. Pool's open.

24:00.399 --> 24:02.484
Miriam, look, I'm sorry. Let's get--

24:02.568 --> 24:04.736
Just go away, Marty.
I don't need your fucking help.

24:04.820 --> 24:06.238
Oh, no, you're crying.

24:06.321 --> 24:08.824
-It's fine. It isn't your fault, okay?
-Well, it is.

24:08.907 --> 24:10.742
No, it isn't. It's fucking Ike, okay?

24:10.826 --> 24:13.704
He put you up to this.
I don't know why you listened to him, but…

24:15.372 --> 24:17.040
…it isn't your fault.

24:18.250 --> 24:21.712
Oh, God. You know, I didn't even want
to come to this stupid thing.

24:21.795 --> 24:23.839
I shouldn't have.
I should have known better.

24:23.922 --> 24:26.049
You didn't know
I was gonna push you in the pool.

24:26.133 --> 24:27.718
No, I did not know that.

24:30.012 --> 24:32.556
But I know Ike's an asshole.

24:32.639 --> 24:35.058
And I know that I am done with him.
I am done!

24:38.854 --> 24:40.480
Did you know that my mother died?

24:40.564 --> 24:42.065
I'm so sorry.

24:42.149 --> 24:44.359
It's okay. It happened years ago.

24:44.443 --> 24:47.905
But my mother died, and Ike fucking
convinced me to stop talking to her.

24:47.988 --> 24:50.115
Just to stop talking to her.

24:50.199 --> 24:51.825
Just completely cut her off.

24:54.828 --> 24:57.039
So I never got to say goodbye to her.

24:59.833 --> 25:01.460
My own mother, I just--

25:02.419 --> 25:04.755
Who fucking does that? Who does that?

25:07.424 --> 25:10.385
-Let's get you into some dry clothes.
-Okay.

25:11.011 --> 25:12.804
-Okay.
-Okay.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.600
It was a new dress!

25:16.683 --> 25:19.478
I'm sorry. I just--

25:22.439 --> 25:24.233
Miriam, you doing all right in there?

25:28.195 --> 25:29.821
I don't think I need the hat.

25:29.905 --> 25:33.033
You may. It really helps, you know,
keep the sun out of your eyes.

25:33.116 --> 25:34.284
You should try it.

25:38.539 --> 25:41.708
I felt bad I got water all over the floor.
Is there a mop?

25:41.792 --> 25:44.419
I don't wanna leave
the housekeeper's room a mess.

25:44.503 --> 25:46.713
This isn't the housekeeper's room.
It's mine.

25:47.214 --> 25:48.382
What?

25:50.175 --> 25:51.385
Yeah.

25:52.010 --> 25:54.179
This is where you sleep?

25:54.888 --> 25:56.181
This is where I sleep.

25:56.265 --> 25:59.434
This is my bed. These are my shells.

25:59.518 --> 26:01.854
My sandpiper painting.
I got my fridge over there.

26:03.105 --> 26:06.275
-Do you wanna go back to the party?
-Not particularly, no.

26:08.694 --> 26:11.029
What is it about that man, right?

26:11.113 --> 26:14.241
Well, he's… He's complicated.

26:15.576 --> 26:16.869
But he cares.

26:18.245 --> 26:19.454
I used to think that.

26:20.664 --> 26:23.417
I used to think that he cared about me.

26:24.668 --> 26:27.546
He was my everything.
Do you know that I actually loved him?

26:28.589 --> 26:30.048
But he broke my heart.

26:30.132 --> 26:33.260
Because he doesn't… care about me at all.

26:33.343 --> 26:35.012
He doesn't care about any of us.

26:35.095 --> 26:38.223
I don't know the specifics
of what you two have going on,

26:39.433 --> 26:41.310
but with us, it's different, okay?

26:41.810 --> 26:44.146
He cares about me, I can assure you.

26:44.229 --> 26:46.523
He loves me. He changed my life.

26:47.024 --> 26:49.401
-He's my best friend.
-Do you hear yourself right now?

26:49.484 --> 26:52.070
A journey of self-discovery isn't easy,
Miriam.

26:52.154 --> 26:54.323
But don't blame Ike for your own shit.

26:54.406 --> 26:56.283
Ike saved me. Do you understand?

26:56.366 --> 26:59.536
I owe my life to him.
I would be dead without Ike.

26:59.620 --> 27:01.079
100% dead.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.041
I owe him everything.

27:04.124 --> 27:05.250
Wow.

27:06.627 --> 27:07.794
You're in real deep, huh?

27:07.878 --> 27:09.379
Everything okay in here?

27:09.463 --> 27:10.923
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

27:11.006 --> 27:14.801
Just helping Miriam, you know,
find some dry clothes.

27:17.846 --> 27:19.431
You look good in green, Miriam.

27:20.724 --> 27:21.642
Thanks.

27:21.725 --> 27:24.895
So sorry to barge in.
Honey, Carl wants to duet with you.

27:24.978 --> 27:27.439
Oh, no. Don't tell me
you broke out the karaoke machine.

27:27.523 --> 27:28.982
I'm guilty as charged.

27:29.066 --> 27:32.694
It's out, it's on, and it is primed
with "Fight for Your Right to Party."

27:32.778 --> 27:34.029
Do I have to?

27:34.112 --> 27:37.032
He's taking us to the opening night
of the New York City Ballet, okay?

27:37.115 --> 27:39.451
-Nothing comes for free.
-No, you've got a point.

27:39.535 --> 27:42.162
Okay, come here.
Oh, do you two want to sing?

27:42.246 --> 27:45.040
Actually, you know what, Marty?
I need you to grab me something, okay?

27:45.123 --> 27:47.334
We're out of limes,
and the people need margaritas.

27:47.417 --> 27:49.795
-Can you handle?
-I'm on it.

27:49.878 --> 27:51.672
Thanks, Marty. Come on, come on, come on.

28:20.617 --> 28:22.619
Marty? Marty Markowitz?

28:23.412 --> 28:25.247
Yes. Mrs. Zicherman.

28:25.330 --> 28:27.374
I thought you moved.

28:27.457 --> 28:29.293
No. No.

28:30.669 --> 28:31.628
Well, I--

28:31.712 --> 28:34.089
The mailbox had a different name,

28:34.173 --> 28:36.133
and I thought you left
without saying goodbye.

28:36.216 --> 28:38.844
No, I'm still there. Yeah.

28:40.137 --> 28:42.806
Okay. Well…
What are you up to?

28:42.890 --> 28:45.350
How's Phyllis?

28:45.434 --> 28:48.145
I heard Nancy had a little girl.

28:48.228 --> 28:51.815
-You must be over the moon.
-Really?

28:51.899 --> 28:55.152
Yeah, I got a birth announcement.
What a cute name.

28:57.154 --> 28:58.405
And how's Joel?

29:02.492 --> 29:05.329
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. No, I'm fine.

29:05.412 --> 29:07.998
I'm just here to, you know,
pick up some essentials.

29:08.749 --> 29:09.750
Some limes.

29:09.833 --> 29:11.627
You look a little pale.

29:11.710 --> 29:13.420
Just tired, I think. Yeah.

29:13.504 --> 29:16.673
Well, it's really good to see you.

29:16.757 --> 29:18.509
-Yeah, likewise. Yeah.
-Yeah.

29:18.592 --> 29:20.719
I mean,
I've been thinking about you a lot.

29:21.803 --> 29:23.430
So I'm glad you're okay.

29:23.514 --> 29:24.515
Yes.

29:25.432 --> 29:30.604
Hey, why don't you bring Phyllis
and the kids over next time they're out?

29:30.687 --> 29:32.814
We'll all catch up. It'll be wonderful.

29:32.898 --> 29:35.859
I haven't seen them in years, so there's
a lot to catch up on.

29:36.443 --> 29:38.904
-Okay, well…
-Okay.

29:38.987 --> 29:41.323
-Well, good to see you. I'll see you.
-Yeah. Oh.

29:42.157 --> 29:44.326
-All right.
-Bye-bye.

29:44.409 --> 29:45.702
-Bye-bye.
-Yeah.

30:45.095 --> 30:46.263
Please, stop! I--

30:48.265 --> 30:50.976
-I'm sorry. Stop. Just hold on.
-What the hell?

30:51.059 --> 30:52.102
Watch where you're going.

31:02.237 --> 31:05.032
Fuck!

31:08.327 --> 31:09.286
Asshole!

31:25.552 --> 31:27.137
Where are you going, Marty?

31:28.847 --> 31:30.349
Come back, sweetheart.

31:30.432 --> 31:32.351
One more spoon for Mama.

31:33.894 --> 31:35.103
Come on.

31:36.647 --> 31:41.318
That's it. That's my good boy. Well done.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.214
How you doing, pal?

32:45.090 --> 32:47.426
You-- Are you okay?

32:47.509 --> 32:50.846
You want some Tylenol?
Some water or some--

32:51.930 --> 32:53.974
You know,
I've been looking for you for ages. It--

32:54.057 --> 32:55.684
People have been asking for you.

33:09.907 --> 33:11.116
Hi, friend.

33:14.578 --> 33:15.996
Tell me their names.

33:16.580 --> 33:17.831
Really?

33:21.043 --> 33:23.378
That's Stu. And he's Ethan.

33:23.879 --> 33:26.423
Sass is the one eating all the--
the plants over there.

33:26.507 --> 33:27.799
And that's Catheryn.

33:27.883 --> 33:29.843
She's kind of demure.

33:29.927 --> 33:31.929
Don't look at her too long.

33:32.012 --> 33:36.099
And that's Adam.
He is not doing so well recently.

33:38.519 --> 33:40.270
They're lucky they have you.

33:42.147 --> 33:43.190
You think?

33:43.774 --> 33:45.067
I know.

33:49.947 --> 33:53.408
So, what are you planning next?
What's your next big project?

33:54.493 --> 33:59.456
I don't know.
I was thinking… maybe some bees.

33:59.540 --> 34:00.916
That would be wonderful.

34:07.256 --> 34:09.882
I'm thinking
I might go back into the city tonight.

34:09.967 --> 34:11.260
Are you sure?

34:12.344 --> 34:13.971
Yeah, I'm not feeling so great.

34:15.013 --> 34:17.516
Okay. Seems a shame, but…

34:19.851 --> 34:22.563
No. Of course.

34:31.822 --> 34:33.657
Oh, hey, Marty,

34:34.658 --> 34:37.202
if you're going back to the city tonight,

34:38.161 --> 34:39.246
could you do me a favor?

34:40.496 --> 34:41.748
Yeah, sure.

34:49.339 --> 34:53.051
I want you to show me

34:55.137 --> 34:58.056
I wanna feel what love is

35:01.393 --> 35:06.148
I know you can show me

35:11.862 --> 35:13.864
-What just happened?
-It's overheated.

35:17.492 --> 35:18.952
-Are we stranded?
-Call for help.

35:19.036 --> 35:20.996
We're stranded? What?

35:21.079 --> 35:24.625
-I got no cell service.
-Does anyone have service?

35:24.708 --> 35:26.210
You don't have any?

35:26.293 --> 35:28.587
All right, everyone.
Relax. It's gonna be okay.

35:28.670 --> 35:31.673
There's a gas station down the road.

35:31.757 --> 35:36.220
I'll go ahead and walk down there
and make a call for help, all right?

35:36.303 --> 35:38.222
Can you see anything?

35:38.305 --> 35:40.224
-Miriam?
-What?

35:40.307 --> 35:44.269
Would you…
Would you mind walking with me?

35:44.353 --> 35:46.355
I feel like I owe you an apology.

35:51.443 --> 35:52.736
You're lucky I have to pee.

35:53.779 --> 35:54.863
Thanks.

35:58.116 --> 36:01.537
Watch out for this mud here.

36:02.120 --> 36:04.456
-Thanks.
-There we go.

36:06.542 --> 36:09.211
You know,
I just wanted to say that--

36:09.294 --> 36:13.215
I'm sorry for earlier
when I lost my temper.

36:14.466 --> 36:16.802
It's okay. I understand.

36:17.302 --> 36:18.720
No, it's not okay.

36:18.804 --> 36:21.932
I mean, you must've
struck a chord, I guess,

36:22.015 --> 36:24.017
but I shouldn't have shouted like that.

36:26.478 --> 36:28.230
It's fine. Really.

36:29.773 --> 36:31.692
It's hard to hear a truth like that.

36:34.361 --> 36:38.240
I mean, I'm…
…still struggling with it myself.

36:39.700 --> 36:42.244
Just keep thinking
what my life would be like if…

36:43.203 --> 36:44.955
I just never met him, you know?

36:45.998 --> 36:46.999
Yeah.

36:53.380 --> 36:54.756
I'm just gonna go use the restroom.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.341
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay.

37:24.703 --> 37:25.704
Thanks.

37:32.044 --> 37:33.212
Marty?

37:36.215 --> 37:38.884
Marty?

37:54.566 --> 37:56.151
-Hello?
-Hello, Miriam.

37:56.818 --> 37:59.905
I'm afraid to say I won't be able to be
your therapist anymore.

37:59.988 --> 38:02.407
I no longer think
this is a healthy arrangement.

38:02.950 --> 38:05.410
I think you're a very toxic person,

38:05.494 --> 38:07.412
and I don't wanna hear from you again.

38:07.496 --> 38:08.497
-Ike!
-Goodbye.

38:09.081 --> 38:11.041
Ike, what's going on?

39:04.636 --> 39:05.971
Thanks, Mike.

39:06.054 --> 39:09.099
I know that was unusual.

39:13.437 --> 39:15.647
Don't ever ask me to do that shit again.
