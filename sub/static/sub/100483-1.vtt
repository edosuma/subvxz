02:08.493 --> 02:11.727
What am I supposed
to be looking for?

02:11.729 --> 02:13.332
All I see is dirt.

02:14.599 --> 02:17.601
The first part of
respecting nature

02:17.603 --> 02:18.538
is understand it.

02:19.671 --> 02:22.275
The soil, has stories to tell.

02:23.474 --> 02:25.144
It has lessons to teach.

02:26.544 --> 02:27.412
We become it.

02:29.215 --> 02:31.417
How do you know all
this great grandfather?

02:32.585 --> 02:34.351
My father taught
me the importance

02:34.353 --> 02:36.286
of the world around me.

02:36.288 --> 02:37.356
Now I'm teaching you.

02:44.763 --> 02:46.699
My father gave it to me.

02:48.766 --> 02:51.236
He said it was a barrier
between good and evil.

02:54.506 --> 02:55.641
Does it do something?

02:57.842 --> 02:59.512
I saw it save
my father's life.

03:31.810 --> 03:32.745
Thank ya.

03:35.747 --> 03:37.381
So remember,

03:37.383 --> 03:40.049
we're gonna keep it
positive today, okay?

03:40.051 --> 03:41.820
Okay, thank you Rose.

03:56.835 --> 03:57.704
William!

03:58.704 --> 03:59.572
Supper!

04:00.906 --> 04:02.975
The children are waiting!

04:48.821 --> 04:49.889
What have we told ya?

04:51.357 --> 04:52.592
It isn't polite to stare.

04:53.725 --> 04:55.862
Even if it is your father.

04:59.497 --> 05:01.498
Thought we agreed?

05:01.500 --> 05:02.869
No tools at the table.

05:04.036 --> 05:04.903
No work.

05:06.504 --> 05:07.904
I was fixing the mailbox.

05:07.906 --> 05:08.775
Right.

05:14.713 --> 05:15.648
Now grace.

05:19.485 --> 05:20.752
Would you like to lead us?

05:29.595 --> 05:31.661
Dear Lord, bless
us and these gifts

05:31.663 --> 05:33.930
for these I give what
you're about to receive

05:33.932 --> 05:38.067
from thy bounty through
Christ our Lord, amen.

05:38.069 --> 05:39.004
Amen.

05:40.072 --> 05:41.007
Thank you Rose.

05:43.675 --> 05:45.742
I hope we all
understand how important

05:45.744 --> 05:46.946
it was to thank our Lord.

05:49.615 --> 05:52.182
I mean, we've been
given many obstacles,

05:52.184 --> 05:56.055
but each meal is a blessing.

05:57.822 --> 06:00.826
Each day is a blessing.

06:52.810 --> 06:53.678
Here.

06:54.980 --> 06:58.548
Will you let me help ya?

06:58.550 --> 06:59.886
Don't touch me!

07:04.088 --> 07:07.089
Let me bleed out!

07:07.091 --> 07:08.161
Let me bleed.

07:10.629 --> 07:11.963
Let me bleed out.

07:17.269 --> 07:19.004
I said let me bleed!

07:25.644 --> 07:26.512
Hank.

07:29.714 --> 07:33.048
What happened?

07:33.050 --> 07:34.620
What is wrong with him?

07:36.721 --> 07:37.789
Your father is sick.

07:39.190 --> 07:40.492
Did he hurt you?

07:42.995 --> 07:44.596
No I'm not hurt.

07:45.997 --> 07:49.134
Just finish your dinner okay?

07:50.668 --> 07:51.803
Finish your dinner.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.815
Lay me down to sleep,

08:39.817 --> 08:42.554
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

09:44.316 --> 09:45.184
William.

09:48.386 --> 09:50.052
No, please!

09:50.054 --> 09:51.054
It isn't real!

09:51.056 --> 09:52.055
Please, it isn't real!

11:09.835 --> 11:10.670
Hank.

11:24.349 --> 11:25.884
I can do it Hank!

11:26.751 --> 11:28.219
I can set you free!

11:31.856 --> 11:34.225
I can't let you hurt anymore!

11:36.027 --> 11:37.096
Listen to me!

11:45.770 --> 11:47.170
No, don't go back there.

11:47.172 --> 11:48.841
They're only gonna hurt you.

11:50.442 --> 11:51.306
I can free you.

11:51.308 --> 11:52.243
I'm not Hank Papa.

11:53.511 --> 11:55.377
I'm the pathway to God.

11:55.379 --> 11:56.182
Listen to me!

11:57.548 --> 11:59.015
I can set you free.

11:59.017 --> 11:59.882
Rose!

12:06.390 --> 12:07.259
Run Rose!

12:08.293 --> 12:09.858
Run!

12:09.860 --> 12:12.060
I am the pathway
to God, listen to me!

12:12.062 --> 12:12.932
Run!

12:14.065 --> 12:16.031
I can't let you kill Hank!

12:52.336 --> 12:53.570
Looks like we figured out

12:53.572 --> 12:55.905
where those gunshots
we heard came from.

12:55.907 --> 12:57.509
Yup, looks like it.

12:59.076 --> 13:01.312
I used to have to drive
him home drunk after the war.

13:02.913 --> 13:04.316
Said he used to see things.

13:05.616 --> 13:07.452
I always figured
it was the whiskey.

13:10.589 --> 13:12.458
Quanah here brought him
home a few times too.

13:16.061 --> 13:17.993
Did William's wife see this?

13:17.995 --> 13:19.130
She's passed on too.

13:21.131 --> 13:22.999
The kids?

13:23.869 --> 13:25.068
Same.

13:25.070 --> 13:25.938
Oh my God!

13:27.272 --> 13:28.841
Except for his eldest.

13:30.642 --> 13:32.007
Where is she?

13:32.009 --> 13:32.876
I don't know Sarge.

13:32.878 --> 13:33.546
Let's find her.

13:34.645 --> 13:35.514
Now!

13:37.883 --> 13:38.547
Now, now!

13:38.549 --> 13:39.549
Rose!

13:39.551 --> 13:40.650
Rose!

13:40.652 --> 13:41.487
Rose!

13:42.386 --> 13:43.254
Rose!

13:44.655 --> 13:45.524
Rose!

13:52.163 --> 13:53.032
Rose!

14:02.573 --> 14:04.909
You don't have any
other family, do you?

14:06.543 --> 14:10.179
Aunts or Uncles, Grandparents?

14:10.181 --> 14:11.050
Anything?

14:13.051 --> 14:14.651
No.

14:14.653 --> 14:15.988
You have nowhere to go?

14:18.188 --> 14:19.555
No.

14:19.557 --> 14:21.523
I'll find somewhere on my own.

14:21.525 --> 14:23.126
No.

14:23.128 --> 14:25.297
Not without family and not
with winter approaching.

14:28.066 --> 14:32.568
Look, there's a place I know
of, a couple of states away.

14:32.570 --> 14:34.874
I spent some time there
as a child myself.

14:37.075 --> 14:39.074
If you don't have
anyone to stay with,

14:39.076 --> 14:41.413
better than the state
putting you in an orphanage.

14:43.948 --> 14:44.616
What is it?

14:46.216 --> 14:49.420
Well, reminds me of a castle.

14:51.355 --> 14:52.955
Like in Europe?

14:52.957 --> 14:54.225
Yes, a lot like that.

14:56.461 --> 14:57.562
But with no wars?

15:00.030 --> 15:02.066
I can assure you,
there's no war there.

15:04.235 --> 15:06.201
The wars did this.

15:06.203 --> 15:07.072
I know.

15:08.173 --> 15:11.076
If you go, you won't have to
worry about anything like that.

15:14.078 --> 15:14.947
Okay?

15:18.515 --> 15:21.052
It's a good place,
it's a good home.

15:45.409 --> 15:46.278
Henry.

15:48.212 --> 15:51.147
There's something I think
you need take a look at.

15:51.149 --> 15:52.484
What might that be?

15:55.620 --> 15:58.222
This morning a girl
was taken to Saint Johns.

15:59.289 --> 16:00.757
She lost her family.

16:00.759 --> 16:02.492
That's not unusual.

16:02.494 --> 16:03.425
Not now.

16:03.427 --> 16:04.996
It's the circumstance.

16:07.131 --> 16:09.133
I think you need to
take a look at this.

16:13.804 --> 16:16.174
I'll be in touch with
the Reverend Mother.

16:23.148 --> 16:25.417
I know her well.

17:39.257 --> 17:41.790
You must be Rose.

17:41.792 --> 17:44.062
I'm Reverend Mother Agnes.

17:45.529 --> 17:47.465
I'm told you're going
to stay with us.

18:47.192 --> 18:48.559
Start
at the beginning.

18:50.394 --> 18:51.696
You mean my childhood?

18:53.298 --> 18:54.165
Yes.

18:56.267 --> 18:57.469
We've been through this.

18:58.403 --> 18:59.471
You know my childhood.

19:01.471 --> 19:04.408
Your self-doubt stems from
more than just your father.

19:06.611 --> 19:08.811
I don't like
thinking of my father.

19:08.813 --> 19:09.615
But you do.

19:11.215 --> 19:12.480
Of course.

19:12.482 --> 19:13.885
Every day since I've been here.

19:15.886 --> 19:17.620
Surely there was
more to your home life

19:17.622 --> 19:19.490
than your fathers illness.

19:22.359 --> 19:25.463
Reverend Mother calls
them dreams, not an illness.

19:27.632 --> 19:29.832
We agree on many things,

19:29.834 --> 19:31.769
but psychology is
not one of them.

19:32.903 --> 19:34.737
The intricacies
of the human mind

19:34.739 --> 19:37.739
are one field where
I feel that not only

19:37.741 --> 19:40.211
are we still learning,
but so is the Lord.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.182
The soul grows as it should.

19:44.915 --> 19:45.850
That's correct.

19:48.318 --> 19:50.885
Have you considered
taking your final vows?

19:50.887 --> 19:51.889
Yes, of course.

19:52.789 --> 19:53.658
All the time.

19:54.625 --> 19:55.727
But you're not ready?

19:59.730 --> 20:01.933
I feel that I could do more.

20:04.001 --> 20:06.771
More for the church,
more for the world.

20:07.872 --> 20:09.404
I hear about the
worsening situation

20:09.406 --> 20:12.211
with Europe, in
Germany, and in Austria.

20:15.046 --> 20:17.813
Isn't there something
the church can do?

20:17.815 --> 20:18.784
We pray for them.

20:21.019 --> 20:22.554
But first, we must remember,

20:23.755 --> 20:25.791
all action begins
with one person.

20:27.424 --> 20:28.757
Who?

20:28.759 --> 20:30.628
That person is you, Rose.

20:50.381 --> 20:51.546
Good afternoon Sister Rose.

20:51.548 --> 20:52.384
Sister Ella.

20:53.518 --> 20:57.452
Oh, I believe the first
frost has gotten to Jeremiah.

20:57.454 --> 20:59.924
I think he gets to most
people more than they think.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.731
You know, he
barely speaks to me.

21:09.733 --> 21:12.303
Ever since he arrived,
he just stares.

21:13.671 --> 21:15.571
Maybe he thinks you're pretty.

21:15.573 --> 21:16.538
No.

21:16.540 --> 21:18.474
He's confusing me with you.

21:18.476 --> 21:20.843
Besides, you know
it's inappropriate.

21:20.845 --> 21:22.978
I wouldn't give
it much thought.

21:22.980 --> 21:25.014
I'm sure he's harmless.

21:25.016 --> 21:26.815
I mean if he weren't,
Father Theodore would

21:26.817 --> 21:28.750
never have invited him here.

21:28.752 --> 21:29.617
I suppose you're right.

21:29.619 --> 21:30.619
Yeah.

21:30.621 --> 21:32.891
You know, you must do
a prayer session today.

21:35.026 --> 21:35.894
I was busy.

21:37.362 --> 21:38.029
Busy?

21:39.630 --> 21:41.566
Well, after much
contemplation,

21:43.034 --> 21:44.336
I believe I'm ready.

21:45.836 --> 21:47.638
I've decided to
take my final vows.

21:48.839 --> 21:49.707
Already?

21:50.775 --> 21:52.607
It's been eight years Rose.

21:52.609 --> 21:53.444
It's time.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.315
You're right.

22:00.017 --> 22:00.852
You know,

22:04.489 --> 22:05.923
it's been really cold lately.

22:08.526 --> 22:10.862
Nothing that a good hot
cup of tea won't solve.

22:12.630 --> 22:13.498
Yes but,

22:15.500 --> 22:16.934
my cup is frozen solid.

22:21.939 --> 22:25.677
Inner peace, is the best fire.

22:28.045 --> 22:28.913
Come on.

22:36.820 --> 22:38.022
I saved you a seat.

22:39.624 --> 22:40.491
Thank you.

22:48.432 --> 22:50.634
Sisters, please
settle in your seats.

22:53.171 --> 22:54.573
And fold your hands.

22:57.842 --> 23:00.209
Before we begin our dinner,

23:00.211 --> 23:03.714
Father Theodore would like
to share a blessing with us.

23:05.048 --> 23:06.550
Thank you Reverend Mother.

23:08.085 --> 23:09.951
Please bow your heads.

23:09.953 --> 23:12.455
In the name of the
Father, and the Son,

23:12.457 --> 23:13.525
and the holy spirit.

23:15.593 --> 23:18.059
Bless us O Lord
and these thy gifts

23:18.061 --> 23:20.062
which we are about to
receive from thy bounty

23:20.064 --> 23:22.664
through Christ our Lord, amen.

23:22.666 --> 23:24.001
Amen.

23:26.103 --> 23:28.671
We have so much
to be thankful for

23:28.673 --> 23:30.008
in the warm embrace of God.

23:30.942 --> 23:33.142
His gifts surround us.

23:33.144 --> 23:35.947
His wisdom surrounds us,
it nurtures us each day.

23:37.013 --> 23:38.680
Even an old man like myself

23:38.682 --> 23:41.816
learns something new every
day because of our Lord.

23:41.818 --> 23:42.820
Amen Father.

23:45.021 --> 23:47.756
God wants to tell you
what you want to hear.

23:47.758 --> 23:50.092
You just have to be
willing to listen.

23:50.094 --> 23:51.826
Now speaking of gifts,

23:51.828 --> 23:54.563
let us all enjoy
this communal supper.

23:54.565 --> 23:56.498
The soup smells
especially delicious.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.699
Excuse me.

23:57.701 --> 23:58.769
It's a perfect
way to stay warm.

24:00.904 --> 24:02.103
May I pour you some soup?

24:02.105 --> 24:03.873
That would be
lovely, thank you.

24:03.875 --> 24:07.511
Can you
pass the rolls please?

25:40.136 --> 25:42.071
Hail Mary full of grace,
the Lord is with you.

25:42.073 --> 25:43.338
Blessed are you among women,

25:43.340 --> 25:44.606
and blessed is the fruit

25:44.608 --> 25:45.940
of your womb, Jesus.

25:45.942 --> 25:48.009
Holy Mary, Mother of
God, pray for us sinners

25:48.011 --> 25:51.249
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

25:59.123 --> 26:04.129
Rose.

26:10.901 --> 26:12.103
I came for you.

26:48.673 --> 26:51.009
Is something troubling you?

26:52.076 --> 26:52.943
No

26:54.077 --> 26:56.146
You're simply occupied.

26:59.316 --> 27:00.184
It's cold.

27:05.455 --> 27:06.323
Feel.

27:08.893 --> 27:09.760
Okay.

27:13.463 --> 27:15.032
Do you feel it?

27:16.701 --> 27:17.769
It's freezing.

27:20.938 --> 27:23.642
I'm sure it is a
reasonable explanation.

27:26.777 --> 27:28.313
But I'm not freezing.

27:33.483 --> 27:34.985
Every day it gets worse.

27:36.386 --> 27:38.056
Have the nightmares returned?

27:44.729 --> 27:46.096
I'm not my father,

27:46.797 --> 27:49.230
if that's what you're implying.

27:49.232 --> 27:50.701
Dreams Rose.

27:52.001 --> 27:55.940
Just as with your father,
they were only dreams.

27:57.074 --> 27:59.811
It's how we react to
them that matters.

28:01.746 --> 28:05.817
When you first came here we
embraced you as one of our own.

28:07.218 --> 28:09.151
Yet, there are certain things

28:09.153 --> 28:11.823
you still choose to face alone.

28:15.960 --> 28:19.961
Even in your room,
you're never alone.

28:19.963 --> 28:23.100
The Lord God is all around us.

28:25.435 --> 28:27.038
You lost your family.

28:28.838 --> 28:30.107
God is your family.

28:31.976 --> 28:33.445
We are your family.

28:37.047 --> 28:37.915
Thank you.

28:41.317 --> 28:44.455
And a last piece
of advice for you is,

28:45.556 --> 28:47.158
get some rest.

28:50.394 --> 28:51.796
I'll do what I can.

28:53.998 --> 28:55.998
Goodnight Rose.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.269
Goodnight Reverend Mother.

30:02.266 --> 30:04.269
Looking for you.

30:05.469 --> 30:06.938
Looking for you.

30:11.474 --> 30:13.074
Looking for you.

30:20.550 --> 30:22.551
I'm
not gonna hurt you!

31:28.618 --> 31:29.486
Cold.

32:15.598 --> 32:19.670
For 10 years, the
dream remains the same.

32:22.138 --> 32:24.541
The nightmares feel so real.

32:26.210 --> 32:29.547
As if I've awoken
in another life.

32:30.681 --> 32:34.152
Each day I question my reality,

32:35.519 --> 32:37.087
and each day it grows harder.

32:38.788 --> 32:40.959
I worry one day I'll wake up

32:42.259 --> 32:44.695
unable to distinguish
this life from the other.

32:46.797 --> 32:49.765
I only hope in writing
down my thoughts

32:49.767 --> 32:51.302
and drawing what I see,

32:52.568 --> 32:54.372
that I'll be able
to save myself,

32:55.305 --> 32:56.441
should it come to that.

33:00.510 --> 33:01.311
How is it?

33:02.712 --> 33:04.246
What?

33:04.248 --> 33:05.249
The tea, how is it?

33:07.317 --> 33:09.988
Oh, it's cold.

33:12.189 --> 33:13.992
You're a lot like
Father Theodore.

33:15.526 --> 33:18.125
How do you mean?

33:18.127 --> 33:20.261
The tea's never good enough.

33:20.263 --> 33:22.299
Not like he has any
basis for comparison.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.732
I don't think he's
been more than

33:24.734 --> 33:26.436
five miles from here
since he was 12-years-old.

33:28.806 --> 33:30.341
We all have our story though.

33:34.811 --> 33:38.548
Lillie, she had a husband

33:39.715 --> 33:41.618
and he lost all his
money in the crash.

33:42.719 --> 33:44.154
He put a gun in his mouth.

33:46.222 --> 33:51.093
Sister Ella, she found Jesus
in the bottom of a bottle

33:51.095 --> 33:52.029
and never came up.

33:54.698 --> 33:57.634
Their mistakes all
brought us to salvation.

34:00.336 --> 34:02.640
My fathers mistake
led me here, not my own.

34:04.374 --> 34:06.644
Are you at peace with
your father's mistake?

34:10.246 --> 34:12.315
Nice speaking
with you Jeremiah.

34:26.762 --> 34:28.799
What was Jeremiah
talking to you about?

34:32.802 --> 34:34.603
Traveling.

34:34.605 --> 34:36.469
Have you ever traveled?

34:36.472 --> 34:37.338
Before?

34:37.340 --> 34:38.208
Yes.

34:39.510 --> 34:43.143
No, just from my
family's home to here.

34:43.146 --> 34:44.282
Where was that again?

34:45.282 --> 34:46.417
Western Pennsylvania.

34:48.552 --> 34:49.554
You ever been there?

34:50.521 --> 34:52.487
No, I can't say that I have.

34:52.489 --> 34:54.157
Just South Carolina to here.

34:55.692 --> 34:57.561
Well you're not
missing much, so...

34:59.362 --> 35:01.298
How was South Carolina?

35:04.635 --> 35:06.704
Life wasn't very
welcoming for me there.

35:07.704 --> 35:09.173
I saw some bad things,

35:10.306 --> 35:11.940
and I almost let them
get the best of me

35:11.942 --> 35:15.112
until one morning I woke up,

35:16.646 --> 35:17.514
no home,

35:18.815 --> 35:19.851
no place to go,

35:21.451 --> 35:22.853
and I knew I needed to change.

35:26.657 --> 35:28.126
What did you see?

35:29.525 --> 35:30.825
I think that's a conversation

35:30.827 --> 35:33.131
best had at another time.

35:35.298 --> 35:36.333
This is a new life.

35:38.568 --> 35:40.834
We cannot allow
ourselves to be judged

35:40.836 --> 35:42.606
by the misdeeds of our past.

35:43.940 --> 35:45.742
Sister Lillie is right.

35:47.344 --> 35:49.844
Sounds to me like you're
running from your past.

35:49.846 --> 35:51.412
No.

35:51.414 --> 35:52.583
Absolutely not.

35:54.751 --> 35:56.952
Making peace with your past

35:56.954 --> 35:58.623
and running from your past,

36:00.289 --> 36:01.492
are two different things.

36:03.427 --> 36:04.892
Maybe that's why
you're not ready

36:04.894 --> 36:06.297
to take your final vows.

36:07.831 --> 36:09.700
You don't have to
be condescending.

36:11.434 --> 36:13.501
I only want
what's best for you.

36:13.503 --> 36:15.306
For everyone for that matter.

36:16.606 --> 36:20.775
If you need my help
moving on from the past,

36:20.777 --> 36:21.646
I can help you.

36:22.778 --> 36:23.780
But ultimately,

36:26.916 --> 36:28.385
it comes down to one thing.

36:29.920 --> 36:30.788
What thing?

36:32.021 --> 36:32.889
You.

36:33.990 --> 36:35.860
The Sisters can only
take you so far.

36:37.728 --> 36:41.398
But your willingness
to surrender to God,

36:42.465 --> 36:44.201
is a choice only you can make.

36:45.268 --> 36:46.503
I learned that being here.

36:48.804 --> 36:50.807
And that's how I
intend to live my life.

36:52.876 --> 36:53.744
You're right.

36:55.746 --> 36:57.682
It's not about being right.

36:59.016 --> 36:59.916
It's about peace.

37:10.827 --> 37:12.827
Bless us O Lord
and these thy gifts

37:12.829 --> 37:14.963
which we are about to
receive from thy bounty

37:14.965 --> 37:17.298
through Christ our Lord, amen.

37:17.300 --> 37:18.568
Amen.

37:46.396 --> 37:48.699
Since the frost
came, I can't breath.

37:52.101 --> 37:53.471
The air dries my throat.

37:55.005 --> 37:56.539
Every morning when I wake up,

37:58.742 --> 38:00.344
I feel like I can't speak.

38:01.978 --> 38:03.811
Dear Rose, it sounds
more like you need a

38:03.813 --> 38:05.615
doctor than a confession booth.

38:07.083 --> 38:08.818
But it's not
that kind of dry...

38:11.822 --> 38:12.890
I feel alone.

38:15.958 --> 38:16.826
I feel frozen.

38:20.764 --> 38:22.867
Tell me about your
last night at home.

38:28.438 --> 38:31.608
All I remember is the
pain in my fathers eyes.

38:35.045 --> 38:35.913
"Kill me.

38:37.981 --> 38:39.917
"Kill me" he used to say.

38:42.885 --> 38:43.721
What else?

38:46.021 --> 38:47.057
There was a rhythm.

38:49.659 --> 38:50.528
Consistent.

38:52.795 --> 38:55.463
Like a clock.

38:55.465 --> 38:56.334
A clock?

38:58.501 --> 39:00.403
Not something you'd
see on the wall.

39:01.871 --> 39:02.772
Something else.

39:06.009 --> 39:06.943
Tick, tock,

39:08.077 --> 39:09.045
tick, tock.

39:14.818 --> 39:17.355
My world's falling apart
but my heart is steady.

39:18.889 --> 39:19.789
It was at ease.

39:22.559 --> 39:23.427
Is this a sin?

39:25.494 --> 39:27.630
Should I have been that calm?

39:28.697 --> 39:30.768
That calm is what
saved your life.

39:32.436 --> 39:34.704
I have felt your regret
since you arrived.

39:36.172 --> 39:39.042
But rather than it disappear
over the years, it's grown.

39:42.179 --> 39:43.447
I'm sorry Father.

39:47.050 --> 39:49.387
God meant for you to
have these emotions.

39:51.788 --> 39:53.090
They're ultimately a test.

39:54.724 --> 39:56.527
Designed to
strengthen your faith.

40:05.001 --> 40:07.936
I don't care, I'm so
happy to be out of the cold.

40:07.938 --> 40:09.472
Sister Ella, Sister Lillie.

40:10.539 --> 40:11.409
Sister Ella.

40:12.576 --> 40:14.476
Showing up late to
take all the credit?

40:14.478 --> 40:15.142
What?

40:15.144 --> 40:16.543
Don't listen to her.

40:16.545 --> 40:18.479
I need to ask
you guys something.

40:18.481 --> 40:19.150
Of course.

40:20.983 --> 40:23.487
Have you noticed anything
strange around here?

40:24.387 --> 40:26.621
Well everything around
here seems normal.

40:26.623 --> 40:29.757
Now when I was at Saint
Christopher, that was strange.

40:29.759 --> 40:31.159
It's painfully normal.

40:31.161 --> 40:32.626
The cold is painful.

40:32.628 --> 40:33.496
I'm used to it.

40:35.030 --> 40:35.865
So no?

40:36.900 --> 40:37.768
Are you okay?

40:41.605 --> 40:42.472
Rose.

40:43.172 --> 40:44.641
I'm not going to hurt you.

40:46.710 --> 40:47.978
I know, I'm sorry.

40:49.179 --> 40:50.014
Old habit.

40:52.715 --> 40:54.050
Well you feel fine to me.

40:56.186 --> 40:58.889
Rose, when I was younger,
I lived by a lake.

41:00.724 --> 41:03.461
And I watched my brother
fall through the ice.

41:04.793 --> 41:07.262
We would cross the
lake as a shortcut

41:07.264 --> 41:08.666
and he'd always go ahead.

41:10.599 --> 41:15.068
I heard this dry crack,

41:15.070 --> 41:15.940
and he was gone.

41:17.773 --> 41:20.677
Swallowed.

41:21.811 --> 41:23.547
He died that night
of hypothermia.

41:27.284 --> 41:31.155
That's when I knew
hell was cold.

41:35.025 --> 41:36.559
If you're not feeling well,

41:37.626 --> 41:39.028
ask for the doctor.

41:40.297 --> 41:42.199
Don't just sit in
your room and hide.

41:44.934 --> 41:45.802
Okay.

41:47.836 --> 41:48.706
Good.

41:49.972 --> 41:50.807
Let's go.

41:53.842 --> 41:56.577
I can't distinguish
dreams from daylight,

41:56.579 --> 41:58.112
memories from nightmares.

41:58.114 --> 41:59.347
I'm seeing things
that aren't there.

41:59.349 --> 42:01.583
I'm hearing things
that don't exist.

42:01.585 --> 42:03.184
At the moment
Father, I feel that,

42:03.186 --> 42:05.055
you're the only one
I can confide in.

42:07.856 --> 42:08.692
Father.

42:12.795 --> 42:13.663
Father?

42:32.114 --> 42:33.280
Sorry Rose.

42:33.282 --> 42:34.682
Hi Jeremiah.

42:34.684 --> 42:36.016
I didn't
mean to startle you.

42:36.018 --> 42:38.288
Do you know where,
where Father Theodore is?

42:39.856 --> 42:42.289
Yeah, he's preparing a
sermon for midnight mass.

42:42.291 --> 42:43.224
No, he was just here.

42:43.226 --> 42:44.626
I was speaking to him.

42:44.628 --> 42:45.994
No, well I've been
here for over an hour

42:45.996 --> 42:48.295
and you were in the
booth when I got here

42:48.297 --> 42:49.299
and you're alone.

42:51.967 --> 42:53.133
He's not here?

42:53.135 --> 42:54.103
No he's not here.

42:55.237 --> 42:57.006
Were you listening
to my confession?

43:00.309 --> 43:01.744
I tried to ignore it but,

43:03.380 --> 43:05.316
I'm on floor duty
this week, so...

43:07.717 --> 43:09.182
I promise I won't tell anyone.

43:09.184 --> 43:10.017
You can trust me.

43:10.019 --> 43:10.920
I have to go.

43:13.123 --> 43:16.057
If you truly believe something
strange is happening here,

43:16.059 --> 43:18.760
you have to determine if it's
something with this convent,

43:18.762 --> 43:20.297
or something
centered around you.

43:23.065 --> 43:24.201
Let me pass Jeremiah.

43:25.902 --> 43:28.036
I'll let you pass, but you
have to answer the question.

43:28.038 --> 43:29.039
You can't ignore it.

43:32.742 --> 43:33.611
It's me.

43:36.211 --> 43:37.778
It's always been me.

43:37.780 --> 43:40.049
That's why you haven't
taken your final vows.

43:41.751 --> 43:42.620
Yes.

43:43.686 --> 43:44.885
And you'll admit it to me

43:44.887 --> 43:46.086
but you won't admit
it to Father Theodore.

43:46.088 --> 43:47.320
You've seen more of
the world than he has.

43:47.322 --> 43:49.824
Well yeah, there's
something here.

43:49.826 --> 43:53.360
It's not inside you,
it's part of you.

43:53.362 --> 43:54.429
It's part of the flesh.

43:54.431 --> 43:56.164
It's my father.

43:56.166 --> 43:56.967
Maybe.

43:58.101 --> 44:00.704
It's shared, it's reborn in you.

44:03.239 --> 44:04.173
You can go.

44:05.842 --> 44:06.710
Go.

45:14.409 --> 45:16.012
Show trust O Lord,

45:18.014 --> 45:20.718
that those who love Your
name will exalt in You.

46:59.414 --> 47:01.018
Kill them.

47:57.340 --> 47:59.072
A demonic
presence was drawn

47:59.074 --> 48:00.476
to my attention years ago.

48:02.577 --> 48:05.012
Looking for you.

48:05.014 --> 48:07.217
We were so
close to casting it out.

48:10.186 --> 48:13.220
Time to get the
ritual started!

48:21.097 --> 48:23.033
This is
the blood of Christ!

48:27.369 --> 48:29.940
The precious blood of Christ!

48:31.074 --> 48:31.942
No!

48:34.177 --> 48:35.379
I cast you out!

48:36.378 --> 48:37.246
Fight it!

49:21.556 --> 49:22.425
Where is she?

49:23.693 --> 49:24.561
I don't know.

49:25.628 --> 49:26.963
I'm worried about her.

50:52.648 --> 50:57.517
♪ When peace like a river ♪

50:57.519 --> 51:01.588
♪ Attendeth my way ♪

51:01.590 --> 51:06.529
♪ When sorrows like
sea billows roll ♪

51:08.597 --> 51:12.266
♪ Whatever my lot ♪

51:12.268 --> 51:16.269
♪ Thou hast taught me to say ♪

51:16.271 --> 51:18.505
♪ It is well ♪

51:18.507 --> 51:20.673
♪ It is well ♪

51:20.675 --> 51:23.144
♪ It is well ♪

51:23.146 --> 51:26.347
♪ It is well ♪

51:34.289 --> 51:36.423
Sister Rose!

51:37.559 --> 51:39.159
I'm sorry.

51:39.161 --> 51:41.497
Mother Reverend, I apologize.

51:58.780 --> 52:00.180
Rose!

52:00.182 --> 52:02.282
Reverend Mother is
looking for you.

52:02.284 --> 52:04.450
I'm sorry Father,
I'm not feeling well-

52:04.452 --> 52:05.588
- You need to rest.

52:06.655 --> 52:08.257
You're clearly exhausted.

52:09.659 --> 52:10.958
You're right.

52:10.960 --> 52:12.258
I am, I just...

52:16.331 --> 52:17.197
I...

52:17.199 --> 52:17.865
Rose.

52:17.867 --> 52:20.200
I'm sorry Father.

52:20.202 --> 52:21.534
Rose!

52:21.536 --> 52:22.404
Rose!

53:12.255 --> 53:14.191
Please, please Jesus.

53:41.516 --> 53:44.788
I never cared for
your choices of tea.

53:47.023 --> 53:48.655
And that's two.

53:48.657 --> 53:49.491
Two?

53:50.626 --> 53:53.430
I told Rose that we only
disagreed on human psychology.

53:54.664 --> 53:56.566
Apparently I've
inadvertently lied to her.

53:57.699 --> 53:59.435
We also disagree on tea.

54:01.903 --> 54:03.672
I'm sure you'll be forgiven.

54:05.074 --> 54:05.909
I would hope.

54:09.378 --> 54:11.280
What did you
and Rose speak of?

54:13.815 --> 54:16.585
The details of confession
are strictly confidential.

54:17.987 --> 54:19.856
I'm concerned
for her well-being.

54:21.389 --> 54:24.728
I know what it's like to
have a past that follows you.

54:30.465 --> 54:32.932
That's what it was.

54:32.934 --> 54:33.802
Her past.

54:35.471 --> 54:37.340
She carries it
on her shoulders.

54:38.606 --> 54:40.309
Sometimes I can almost see it.

54:42.744 --> 54:44.280
You aren't much different.

54:45.748 --> 54:46.615
The bottle

54:48.016 --> 54:49.485
was my vice.

54:53.422 --> 54:55.358
Gambling was my vice.

55:00.695 --> 55:01.831
I never met my parents.

55:04.833 --> 55:09.371
I'd call to call on Father
Henry to evaluate Rose.

55:11.373 --> 55:13.574
Henry doesn't specialize

55:13.576 --> 55:16.512
in troubled young women coming
to terms with their past.

55:17.847 --> 55:21.051
He specializes in something
that you and I don't see.

55:22.784 --> 55:25.052
I don't know if I'm right,

55:25.054 --> 55:26.787
but if I'm wrong,

55:26.789 --> 55:28.792
I'd rather treat her early.

55:30.893 --> 55:34.595
Childhood trauma isn't a
reason to assume we need Henry.

55:34.597 --> 55:36.066
This isn't the 1600s.

55:37.599 --> 55:38.735
There's more to it.

55:53.481 --> 55:55.481
Come
and embrace me Lord.

55:55.483 --> 55:57.517
Hold me secure.

55:57.519 --> 55:59.153
Hold me strong.

55:59.155 --> 56:00.357
Hold me forever.

56:01.090 --> 56:03.026
In Your everlasting arms, amen.

57:12.228 --> 57:13.159
Amen.

57:13.161 --> 57:14.994
Peace be with you.

57:14.996 --> 57:16.697
And also with you.

57:16.699 --> 57:18.264
I would like to
welcome everyone here

57:18.266 --> 57:19.967
for this celebration

57:19.969 --> 57:22.836
of the solemn profession
of Sister Ella

57:22.838 --> 57:24.474
to the holy spirit.

57:25.641 --> 57:29.976
It is an important moment for
our community, Sister Ella,

57:29.978 --> 57:31.612
and of course our church because

57:31.614 --> 57:33.847
it is a moment of witness.

57:33.849 --> 57:35.985
A declaration of vows in faith,

57:36.851 --> 57:39.987
which represents a
small inkling of hope

57:39.989 --> 57:41.523
the world sorely needs.

57:42.992 --> 57:45.659
Dear Sister, are
you now resolved

57:45.661 --> 57:47.931
to unite yourself
more closely to God?

57:48.998 --> 57:50.597
I am.

57:50.599 --> 57:52.999
Are you resolved
with the help of god

57:53.001 --> 57:55.936
to undertake that life
of perfect chastity,

57:55.938 --> 57:59.673
obedience, and poverty
chosen for themselves

57:59.675 --> 58:02.275
by Christ our Lord
and His virgin mother,

58:02.277 --> 58:04.878
and so persevering it forever.

58:04.880 --> 58:05.748
I am.

58:06.916 --> 58:10.220
Are you now resolved
to live alone for God

58:11.153 --> 58:15.088
in persevering prayer,
in willing penitence,

58:15.090 --> 58:17.227
in humble work and
holiness of life?

58:19.061 --> 58:19.929
I am.

59:43.311 --> 59:45.315
No, no, no, no!

59:47.849 --> 59:48.749
Fight it Rose!

59:48.751 --> 59:50.117
Fight it, please!

59:50.119 --> 59:50.987
Fight it!

59:58.260 --> 01:00:00.193
Fight against it Rose.

01:00:00.195 --> 01:00:01.762
Fight the evil Rose!

01:00:36.431 --> 01:00:38.166
Good morning Father Henry.

01:01:19.974 --> 01:01:22.242
Where is Theodore?

01:01:22.244 --> 01:01:24.478
He's hearing confessions.

01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:29.418
We need help.

01:01:31.353 --> 01:01:34.157
We need someone
with your expertise.

01:01:37.992 --> 01:01:39.825
Last time you called on me

01:01:39.827 --> 01:01:43.362
we performed an
exorcism on an alter boy

01:01:43.364 --> 01:01:46.168
and his parents sent
him to an asylum.

01:01:49.871 --> 01:01:51.106
He was a quiet boy.

01:01:52.775 --> 01:01:53.443
Innocent.

01:01:59.447 --> 01:02:02.250
I found this in my room.

01:02:04.385 --> 01:02:06.519
There were more in the hallways

01:02:06.521 --> 01:02:08.190
and other rooms.

01:02:11.527 --> 01:02:14.063
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

01:02:15.931 --> 01:02:18.067
I've seen crosses
fly off of walls.

01:02:19.467 --> 01:02:21.269
I've seen them
turned upside down.

01:02:22.471 --> 01:02:24.407
I have never seen
anything like this.

01:02:27.208 --> 01:02:31.146
This looks like someone
tossed it under a combine.

01:02:33.414 --> 01:02:34.416
You have a source?

01:02:37.552 --> 01:02:39.221
It's Rose, Henry.

01:03:09.251 --> 01:03:10.920
I'd like to meet with her

01:03:12.253 --> 01:03:13.389
as soon as possible.

01:03:15.456 --> 01:03:16.525
Of course.

01:03:29.137 --> 01:03:30.539
Father Theodore.

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:35.344
Father Theodore are you here?

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:42.418
Father Theodore.

01:03:46.954 --> 01:03:48.954
Yes my child.

01:03:48.956 --> 01:03:50.893
Forgive me Father
for I have sinned.

01:03:52.027 --> 01:03:54.661
I don't know how long it's
been since my last confession

01:03:54.663 --> 01:03:56.898
because I've lost
all sense of time.

01:03:58.233 --> 01:04:00.432
I don't know past from present,

01:04:00.434 --> 01:04:03.172
I don't know right from wrong.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:06.409
Go on my child.

01:04:08.242 --> 01:04:09.445
Set your worries aside.

01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:11.978
No one can hurt you here.

01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:13.248
God will protect you.

01:04:15.182 --> 01:04:17.853
I haven't been
entirely honest with you.

01:04:19.454 --> 01:04:20.923
I've been seeing things.

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:23.188
I've been hearing things.

01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:25.325
I'm cold inside but,

01:04:25.327 --> 01:04:27.029
my skull is burning.

01:04:28.463 --> 01:04:30.664
I have visions of memories

01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:32.301
that aren't mine.

01:04:34.936 --> 01:04:38.271
I should be in mine,
inside of time.

01:04:38.273 --> 01:04:41.309
God has laid a special
path for each of us.

01:04:43.411 --> 01:04:47.015
The test is physical,
but also mental.

01:04:50.018 --> 01:04:52.588
Focus on your breathing
and listen to your heart.

01:04:56.157 --> 01:04:58.493
That is a special bond
between you and God.

01:04:59.695 --> 01:05:02.030
It beats in rhythm
and He hears it.

01:05:03.465 --> 01:05:06.499
The rhythm.

01:05:06.501 --> 01:05:07.570
Like a clock.

01:05:12.474 --> 01:05:13.342
Steady.

01:05:15.309 --> 01:05:16.177
Steady.

01:05:19.514 --> 01:05:20.449
Tick, tock,

01:05:21.315 --> 01:05:22.250
tick, tock.

01:05:28.623 --> 01:05:30.126
I cast you out!

01:05:32.594 --> 01:05:34.996
Out of this daughter of God!

01:05:38.099 --> 01:05:40.368
Out of this child of Christ!

01:05:45.673 --> 01:05:47.143
When you were younger,

01:05:48.342 --> 01:05:49.508
an altar boy named Christopher

01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:51.110
came to me with
similar symptoms.

01:05:51.112 --> 01:05:53.281
By this
blessed holy water!

01:05:58.487 --> 01:05:59.753
Kill him!

01:05:59.755 --> 01:06:01.287
Kill him!

01:06:01.289 --> 01:06:03.359
He complained of
fever when he was cold.

01:06:04.259 --> 01:06:05.628
He claimed to hear voices.

01:06:08.697 --> 01:06:09.664
See visions.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.632
But there was nothing there.

01:06:13.768 --> 01:06:15.034
Father!

01:06:15.036 --> 01:06:15.702
Father please!

01:06:15.704 --> 01:06:16.572
Father Theodore!

01:06:17.572 --> 01:06:19.240
Soon he became destructive.

01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:24.179
We called in one
of my colleagues

01:06:25.179 --> 01:06:27.546
with an aptitude for exorcism.

01:06:27.548 --> 01:06:28.416
Father Henry.

01:06:31.253 --> 01:06:32.117
Please!

01:06:32.119 --> 01:06:33.787
Father Theodore!

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:35.521
It was the worst pain I'd ever

01:06:35.523 --> 01:06:37.257
seen another human being in.

01:06:37.259 --> 01:06:38.191
No!

01:06:38.193 --> 01:06:40.293
It would writhe, and twist,

01:06:40.295 --> 01:06:42.465
and scream profanities.

01:06:45.733 --> 01:06:47.534
The closest thing that
I could compare it to

01:06:47.536 --> 01:06:50.572
would be, from what I
understand of childbirth.

01:06:52.173 --> 01:06:55.610
Given this situation,

01:06:57.746 --> 01:06:59.144
it was rebirth.

01:06:59.146 --> 01:07:01.280
Kill them!

01:07:01.282 --> 01:07:02.548
Kill them!

01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:03.715
Kill them!

01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:33.213
Have you seen Rose?

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:35.251
Not since choir rehearsal.

01:07:40.387 --> 01:07:42.123
Something's wrong.

01:07:43.891 --> 01:07:45.193
What is it?

01:07:47.195 --> 01:07:48.364
I don't know.

01:07:49.731 --> 01:07:52.501
But something's
definitely wrong.

01:08:28.368 --> 01:08:29.238
Quanah,

01:08:30.572 --> 01:08:32.640
Quanah, I need your help.

01:08:33.807 --> 01:08:36.112
Please, I need your help.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.115
The others have failed me.

01:08:41.448 --> 01:08:43.282
God has failed me.

01:08:43.283 --> 01:08:43.950
Please don't let me

01:08:43.952 --> 01:08:45.551
become my father.

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:46.421
Please, don't let
me become my father!

01:08:58.733 --> 01:08:59.702
Sister Rose.

01:09:01.603 --> 01:09:02.470
What is this?

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:07.874
A prayer.

01:09:07.876 --> 01:09:09.845
It doesn't look like
any prayer I know.

01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:14.416
Looks like a pagan ritual.

01:09:15.817 --> 01:09:17.817
Worship the earth in witchcraft.

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:18.687
It's not.

01:09:20.488 --> 01:09:22.158
Don't tell anyone that it is.

01:09:24.725 --> 01:09:25.594
I won't.

01:09:31.765 --> 01:09:33.835
Reverend Mother called
in a specialist.

01:09:35.904 --> 01:09:37.439
He'd like to speak with you.

01:09:41.643 --> 01:09:42.743
What is it?

01:09:45.645 --> 01:09:48.848
I'm confused, you have to
tell me what's going on.

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:51.517
I don't know, I
can't explain it.

01:09:51.519 --> 01:09:52.654
But it's Rose.

01:09:58.792 --> 01:10:00.528
Oh Father help us!

01:10:04.599 --> 01:10:05.665
Oh my God.

01:10:05.667 --> 01:10:06.936
Did Rose do that?

01:10:07.935 --> 01:10:08.938
I hope not.

01:10:23.818 --> 01:10:25.351
No, no thank you.

01:10:25.353 --> 01:10:26.956
You're
freezing, at least hold it.

01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:31.924
God, I feel like I'm burning!

01:10:31.926 --> 01:10:32.924
Well what do you think it is?

01:10:32.926 --> 01:10:34.660
I don't know!

01:10:34.662 --> 01:10:35.894
Whatever it is,
it took my family,

01:10:35.896 --> 01:10:36.862
and now it wants me!

01:10:36.864 --> 01:10:39.432
So maybe I should just
go see this specialist!

01:10:39.434 --> 01:10:40.633
Well
he's aware of you.

01:10:40.635 --> 01:10:41.933
He's known about you
since your childhood,

01:10:41.935 --> 01:10:43.702
since you were brought here.

01:10:43.704 --> 01:10:44.573
Why?

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:46.508
Precaution.

01:10:48.076 --> 01:10:49.677
Have you seen any of the signs?

01:10:52.646 --> 01:10:53.948
Who was with him in here last?

01:10:55.582 --> 01:10:56.715
I think it was Rose.

01:10:56.717 --> 01:10:57.784
Where is she?

01:10:57.786 --> 01:10:59.518
She wasn't at the commissary.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.786
You don't think
she did this do you?

01:11:00.788 --> 01:11:02.291
I certainly hope not.

01:11:03.557 --> 01:11:07.059
Ella, Lillie, leave
this place at once.

01:11:07.061 --> 01:11:10.463
Go to Saint Jude's
two towns over.

01:11:10.465 --> 01:11:11.397
Of course.

01:11:11.399 --> 01:11:12.565
Thank you Reverend Mother.

01:11:12.567 --> 01:11:13.935
Quickly, please!

01:11:23.411 --> 01:11:24.744
What signs?

01:11:24.746 --> 01:11:27.347
Unseen voices,
slip from reality,

01:11:27.349 --> 01:11:30.750
hunger pains,
sensitivity to light,

01:11:30.752 --> 01:11:32.451
but most importantly,

01:11:32.453 --> 01:11:35.021
you're a virgin to spirituality.

01:11:35.023 --> 01:11:36.555
Wait, a virgin?

01:11:36.557 --> 01:11:38.424
You've been here
since you were a child

01:11:38.426 --> 01:11:41.561
and you've yet to
take your final vows!

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:42.431
Why?

01:11:43.364 --> 01:11:45.831
Father Theodore says
it's because of regret.

01:11:45.833 --> 01:11:46.699
Regret?

01:11:46.701 --> 01:11:47.567
Yes.

01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:48.735
Regret is an emotion.

01:11:48.737 --> 01:11:50.836
It's not even real,
it's not tangible.

01:11:50.838 --> 01:11:53.106
Why have you not
taken your final vows?

01:11:53.108 --> 01:11:54.906
Look, I don't know
what you want me to say!

01:11:54.908 --> 01:11:56.976
Whatever shares your
body is restraining you.

01:11:56.978 --> 01:11:59.845
It's something else,
it's something living.

01:11:59.847 --> 01:12:00.879
You're mad.

01:12:00.881 --> 01:12:02.013
You're frightening me!

01:12:02.015 --> 01:12:02.882
Stop it!

01:12:02.884 --> 01:12:04.049
You're frightening me!

01:12:04.051 --> 01:12:05.651
What I saw you
doing isn't anything

01:12:05.653 --> 01:12:07.486
a child of God would do!

01:12:07.488 --> 01:12:09.054
Worshiping the earth?

01:12:09.056 --> 01:12:11.460
People were burned
alive for less!

01:12:12.659 --> 01:12:14.494
I'm saving your soul Rose!

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:15.861
These walls are thin!

01:12:15.863 --> 01:12:17.662
You killed Father Theodore!

01:12:17.664 --> 01:12:19.799
There's evil within you!

01:12:19.801 --> 01:12:20.665
You're a freak!

01:12:20.667 --> 01:12:21.769
You're an abomination!

01:12:23.404 --> 01:12:24.405
No!

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:26.074
No!

01:12:30.043 --> 01:12:31.412
Let us continue.

01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:40.018
Dear God, let her
pray for your love

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:41.923
and light to come into her.

01:12:43.158 --> 01:12:45.494
Oh dear Father, may
she be your child.

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:49.061
Dear Jesus Christ,

01:12:49.063 --> 01:12:50.065
Redeemer and Savior,

01:12:50.765 --> 01:12:53.499
forgive Sister Rose of her sins.

01:12:53.501 --> 01:12:56.635
Just as you forgave
Peter his denials.

01:12:56.637 --> 01:12:58.841
As you forgave those
who crucified You.

01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:04.210
Lord, forgive her of her
sins and her transgressions,

01:13:04.212 --> 01:13:07.979
we gravel at her repentance
and her tears of sorrow.

01:13:11.118 --> 01:13:14.454
A fight against the powers
of darkness in this world.

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:16.656
Help us against the rulers

01:13:16.658 --> 01:13:18.991
of hell in high places.

01:13:18.993 --> 01:13:20.726
Dear Lord, help us.

01:13:20.728 --> 01:13:23.795
The spirits of wicked
faith in high places!

01:13:25.099 --> 01:13:27.799
And rulers and
principalities in power,

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:30.870
and spirits of darkness!

01:13:30.872 --> 01:13:32.472
- Help us Lord!
- Help me!

01:13:32.474 --> 01:13:34.106
The spirits
in high places,

01:13:34.108 --> 01:13:35.444
help us to fight!

01:14:05.506 --> 01:14:07.173
What is this?

01:14:07.175 --> 01:14:08.040
Help me!

01:14:08.042 --> 01:14:09.645
Jeremiah!

01:14:11.145 --> 01:14:12.111
What is this?

01:14:12.113 --> 01:14:13.048
Where am I?

01:14:14.716 --> 01:14:15.918
Where you've always been.

01:14:17.051 --> 01:14:18.918
In the convent.

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:20.519
This room.

01:14:20.521 --> 01:14:21.720
What?

01:14:21.722 --> 01:14:22.988
Where's Reverend Mother?

01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:25.156
You've been here all
this time, many years.

01:14:25.158 --> 01:14:26.795
We've tried nearly everything.

01:14:28.662 --> 01:14:29.995
Where's Reverend Mother?

01:14:29.997 --> 01:14:31.863
She's dead!

01:14:31.865 --> 01:14:33.065
You're lying to me!

01:14:36.938 --> 01:14:38.870
Fight it
Rose, you must fight!

01:14:38.872 --> 01:14:40.540
Fight it!

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:44.943
Oh my God.

01:14:47.215 --> 01:14:48.080
What?

01:14:48.082 --> 01:14:48.951
What?

01:14:50.284 --> 01:14:51.750
My book.

01:14:51.752 --> 01:14:53.285
My book!

01:14:53.287 --> 01:14:54.786
I drew in my notebook!

01:14:54.788 --> 01:14:58.156
I draw, I draw, the
outside of this room.

01:14:58.158 --> 01:14:59.527
I draw outside, I draw animals,

01:15:00.295 --> 01:15:01.227
they're peaceful.

01:15:01.229 --> 01:15:02.894
I'm at peace.

01:15:02.896 --> 01:15:04.162
Please.

01:15:04.164 --> 01:15:05.298
Please.

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:06.799
Please.

01:15:06.801 --> 01:15:07.666
Please.

01:15:07.668 --> 01:15:08.567
I draw.

01:15:08.569 --> 01:15:10.037
I don't see forests!

01:15:11.171 --> 01:15:12.840
I don't see happy
little animals!

01:15:14.841 --> 01:15:16.709
Does this look peaceful to you!

01:15:19.314 --> 01:15:20.979
Look at it!

01:15:20.981 --> 01:15:22.348
No!

01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:23.214
No!

01:15:23.216 --> 01:15:24.083
No!

01:15:24.085 --> 01:15:25.317
Look at it!

01:15:25.319 --> 01:15:26.184
No!

01:15:26.186 --> 01:15:27.385
No, no, no, no!

01:15:27.387 --> 01:15:30.589
You've been here
since your family was killed!

01:15:30.591 --> 01:15:32.594
No, no, no, no!

01:15:34.796 --> 01:15:35.660
Fight it Rose!

01:15:35.662 --> 01:15:36.329
Fight it!

01:15:36.331 --> 01:15:37.796
Please, fight it!

01:15:48.076 --> 01:15:50.343
The rulers of
darkness in the world

01:15:50.345 --> 01:15:52.210
against the spirit of wickedness

01:15:52.212 --> 01:15:55.113
in high places!

01:16:19.373 --> 01:16:21.108
Father.

01:16:23.778 --> 01:16:25.977
It was blessed by the Vatican.

01:16:25.979 --> 01:16:28.013
It wasn't easy to get.

01:16:28.015 --> 01:16:29.850
Desperate
times Father.

01:16:34.322 --> 01:16:35.657
We're all here with God.

01:16:37.425 --> 01:16:38.857
I cast you out.

01:16:44.931 --> 01:16:46.801
Out of this daughter of God.

01:16:51.139 --> 01:16:53.141
Out of this child of Christ.

01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:58.678
By this blessed holy water

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:01.680
and by the blood of Christ,

01:17:01.682 --> 01:17:03.885
Redeemer Lord, Savior,

01:17:05.286 --> 01:17:07.352
remember not her sins

01:17:07.354 --> 01:17:08.888
as you forgot

01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:10.755
the betrayal of Peter

01:17:10.757 --> 01:17:13.028
and those who crucified You.

01:17:17.931 --> 01:17:20.700
Count not her transgressions,

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:23.436
but rather, her
tears of repentance.

01:17:23.438 --> 01:17:25.170
- Remember not her iniquities,
- Damn you!

01:17:25.172 --> 01:17:27.039
But for her sorrows

01:17:27.041 --> 01:17:28.441
- for the offenses she has
- Damn you!

01:17:28.443 --> 01:17:30.175
Committed
against thee!

01:17:39.386 --> 01:17:40.852
There's something in,

01:17:40.854 --> 01:17:42.254
there's something in me!

01:17:42.256 --> 01:17:43.959
It's within, it's a man!

01:17:51.932 --> 01:17:55.136
Rose.

01:17:59.407 --> 01:18:00.275
Rose.

01:18:13.954 --> 01:18:15.286
Rose.

01:18:22.262 --> 01:18:25.966
I'm sorry I wasn't
there to watch you grow.

01:18:29.302 --> 01:18:30.238
I was in pain,

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:33.307
and I let it defeat me.

01:18:36.176 --> 01:18:37.411
Don't let it defeat you.

01:18:38.912 --> 01:18:41.048
Don't let it defeat you Rose.

01:18:48.523 --> 01:18:49.458
I love you.

01:19:07.007 --> 01:19:09.275
All of the days of her life!

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:11.076
Be cursed with the
power of Christ!

01:19:28.029 --> 01:19:29.961
I cast you out!

01:19:31.932 --> 01:19:33.566
Lord Jesus Christ!

01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:34.900
True light!

01:19:34.902 --> 01:19:35.901
That it lightens
every man and woman

01:19:35.903 --> 01:19:37.503
who comes into this world!

01:19:37.505 --> 01:19:39.237
Blessings upon these
earthly candles,

01:19:39.239 --> 01:19:42.508
and enlighten them with
thy heavenly grace!

01:19:49.583 --> 01:19:50.786
You want this?

01:19:54.956 --> 01:19:55.824
Quanah.

01:19:57.992 --> 01:19:58.927
I trusted you.

01:19:59.627 --> 01:20:00.862
I trusted you!

01:20:03.331 --> 01:20:05.400
I told you about my father.

01:20:06.868 --> 01:20:08.203
I am not who you think I am.

01:20:14.074 --> 01:20:15.206
No!

01:20:15.208 --> 01:20:16.608
And now you're
gonna burn with this!

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:24.085
Inner peace is the best fire.

01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:47.175
For 10 years now, the
dream remains the same.

01:20:49.409 --> 01:20:51.445
The nightmares feel so real.

01:20:55.983 --> 01:20:58.584
My only hope in writing
down my thoughts

01:20:58.586 --> 01:21:00.155
and drawing what I see,

01:21:01.454 --> 01:21:03.123
that I'll be able
to save myself.

01:21:52.238 --> 01:21:54.442
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.251
All aboard!

01:22:07.253 --> 01:22:09.988
Last stop, Long Island!
