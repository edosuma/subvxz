01:58.840 --> 02:00.900
Some women
are born beautiful.

02:01.650 --> 02:03.200
They make it look easy!

02:03.550 --> 02:06.420
But most women have to put
a little time and effort...

02:06.440 --> 02:07.940
Into their appearance.

02:09.060 --> 02:10.490
And then, there are those of us...

02:10.520 --> 02:12.450
Who need all the help
we can get.

02:13.870 --> 02:15.240
Like me.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.930
Tonight my husband
is taking me...

03:05.960 --> 03:08.160
To a very fancy affair...

03:09.280 --> 03:12.050
So I'm going to do
whatever it takes to look great.

03:14.320 --> 03:17.310
Sometimes you just have
to pull out all the staff.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.940
Yet another magnificent
miniseries...

04:25.960 --> 04:28.090
Based on the
passionate prose of...

04:28.120 --> 04:30.800
The reigning Royal Highness
of romance...

04:30.950 --> 04:33.020
Her Majesty Mary Fisher.

04:33.380 --> 04:35.560
At the tender age of 34...

04:35.630 --> 04:38.450
She has already penned
over 30 novels!

04:38.710 --> 04:41.460
These steamy stories
have sold in the millions...

04:41.600 --> 04:43.120
Affording Mary a lifestyle...

04:43.240 --> 04:45.950
Even her wealthiest heroine
would envy.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.840
Here, in her lavish
Long Island Palace...

04:49.030 --> 04:51.420
Mary lives in the lap of luxury.

04:51.650 --> 04:52.660
Passion!

04:53.090 --> 04:54.200
Excitement!

04:54.680 --> 04:57.410
I think that's important
in a long term relationship.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.280
And that's what I think women
find from my novels, a...

05:01.470 --> 05:03.230
They find ways to...

05:03.580 --> 05:05.360
Make their men feel...

05:05.560 --> 05:07.190
Important and comfortable...

05:07.230 --> 05:09.410
So that he knows
that he is...

05:09.760 --> 05:10.770
The man...

05:11.170 --> 05:13.070
You know, so
there's no confusion.

05:13.950 --> 05:15.490
Ever the faithful daughter...

05:15.520 --> 05:18.160
Mary is never too busy
to visit with her mother.

05:18.290 --> 05:20.060
Who convalesces in style...

05:20.090 --> 05:22.030
At the Golden Twilight
rest home.

05:22.270 --> 05:25.550
Mrs. Francine Fisher
is the proud matriarch...

05:25.570 --> 05:26.870
Of the Fisher clan.

05:28.350 --> 05:31.580
Champagne, caviar
and dashing men.

05:32.090 --> 05:33.160
Sit down!

05:33.760 --> 05:34.690
Mary Fisher...

05:34.720 --> 05:37.510
Takes a moment to reflect on
her writing philosophy...

05:37.680 --> 05:38.800
Mr. Patchett...

05:38.820 --> 05:40.780
I got your wife
on line three.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.200
Hello, Ruth!

05:46.260 --> 05:47.550
Hi, honey!

05:47.610 --> 05:49.670
How's my favorite
accountant doing today?

05:49.920 --> 05:52.320
Oh, I'm swamped,
my secretary quit...

05:52.350 --> 05:53.520
I'm going out of my mind...

05:53.540 --> 05:55.200
I'm trying to break
in a new girl...

05:55.460 --> 05:57.200
Oh, well, I just called
to tell you...

05:57.230 --> 05:59.850
How excited I'm
about the party tonight!

05:59.880 --> 06:02.140
Ruth, I'm warning you!
It's going to be very boring.

06:02.170 --> 06:03.920
A bunch of people
I don't really even know.

06:03.950 --> 06:05.720
I just want to do
some networking...

06:05.750 --> 06:07.350
Trying to round up
some new clients...

06:07.380 --> 06:08.200
I don't think it's...

06:08.220 --> 06:10.930
Worth your time to drive
all the way into the city.

06:11.230 --> 06:12.820
Oh, I don't mind!

06:13.130 --> 06:15.440
We haven't been out
together for so long!

06:15.680 --> 06:17.610
Okay, Ruth.
Don't say I didn't warn you!

06:17.640 --> 06:18.730
I got to run, okay sweety?

06:18.860 --> 06:19.570
Bye, bye!

06:19.780 --> 06:20.770
Bye, Bob!

07:09.500 --> 07:10.630
How did you get here?

07:10.660 --> 07:13.160
Oh, I took the Concorde.
It was a little cramped.

07:26.110 --> 07:27.760
Oh, I'm so sorry!

07:28.680 --> 07:30.150
Oh, my God!

07:30.180 --> 07:31.470
It's you!

07:31.490 --> 07:32.450
I don't believe it!

07:32.770 --> 07:34.310
- Oh, I'm so sorry!
- You've ruined my...

07:34.340 --> 07:36.110
Ruth, what are you doing?

07:36.210 --> 07:37.620
Bob, I just spilled
my wine...

07:37.650 --> 07:39.610
On the famous
author Mary Fisher!

07:39.640 --> 07:41.300
I have read
all of your books!

07:41.330 --> 07:43.080
- That's very nice!
- Ruth, why don't you go get...

07:43.110 --> 07:45.340
Some salt and some Perrier
to remove the stain?

07:45.580 --> 07:47.160
Hurry, honey, hurry!

07:59.450 --> 08:01.600
Salt and Perrier!
A man...

08:02.350 --> 08:04.380
Familiar with a woman's domain...

08:04.840 --> 08:05.890
I like that!

08:06.240 --> 08:08.270
It's just that my wife is
always toppling things.

08:08.340 --> 08:10.540
- She's a bit clumsy.
- That's your wife?

08:10.860 --> 08:12.640
- Too bad!
- Yeah...

08:12.760 --> 08:14.040
It's too late!

08:14.400 --> 08:17.470
That stain has already set.
Why don't we just cover it up?

08:18.020 --> 08:20.620
I insist that you send
the bill for the dry cleaning.

08:21.760 --> 08:22.670
I'm sorry.

08:23.510 --> 08:24.950
It's very gallant!

08:26.630 --> 08:29.020
Now I need
another drink, Mr.?

08:29.290 --> 08:31.160
I'm Patchett,
Bob Patchett.

08:33.270 --> 08:34.480
Mr. Patchett.

08:36.840 --> 08:39.520
Hey, can I have some
salt and Perrier?

08:40.010 --> 08:42.539
I just knocked my wine
on Mary Fisher.

08:42.559 --> 08:44.430
You know, the famous author?

08:46.310 --> 08:49.320
What is it exactly that
you do, Mr. Patchett?

08:49.350 --> 08:51.220
- I'm a financial consultant.
- Really?

08:51.240 --> 08:51.940
Yeah!

08:52.220 --> 08:53.430
Oh, I'm filled with awe...

08:53.460 --> 08:54.930
For men who know how
to handle money!

08:55.420 --> 08:57.200
I can't even balance
my own checkbook!

08:57.330 --> 08:59.320
Doesn't your accountant
do that for you?

09:00.320 --> 09:01.400
Should he?

09:01.850 --> 09:03.840
The good ones do.
Actually, Miss Fisher...

09:03.870 --> 09:06.410
I'm moving heavily into
artists management.

09:06.530 --> 09:10.230
I like to be around creative types.
I find it very... stimulating.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.780
Stimulated accounting
sounds...

09:13.310 --> 09:14.880
Very interesting!

09:15.790 --> 09:17.500
Tell me more,
Mr. Patchett.

09:18.750 --> 09:21.490
I refuse to divulge any more
information about myself...

09:21.520 --> 09:23.650
Unless you call me Bob.

09:24.660 --> 09:25.900
All right!

09:26.590 --> 09:28.230
If you promise to call me...

09:28.890 --> 09:29.910
Mary.

09:45.770 --> 09:47.660
All the little families...

09:48.420 --> 09:50.030
The mommies and daddies and...

09:50.600 --> 09:51.560
Their little children...

09:51.590 --> 09:53.120
Tucked away for the night!

09:55.320 --> 09:56.870
How lucky they all are!

10:00.030 --> 10:02.030
It's so kind of you
to take me home.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.550
Absolutely no problem!

10:13.670 --> 10:15.050
Now, Ruth, be careful.

10:15.110 --> 10:16.720
I need to drive
from here, okay honey?

10:16.770 --> 10:18.780
Shouldn't we take her
to the door, Bob?

10:18.820 --> 10:21.870
Oh, that's all right, Miss Fisher,
we live just arond the block.

10:21.890 --> 10:23.640
There's no sense in making
an U turn, right sweety?

10:23.670 --> 10:25.650
No, we still have
such a long way to go.

10:26.210 --> 10:27.530
It's another hour to Hamp...

10:28.390 --> 10:29.520
Hamptons!

10:30.040 --> 10:31.120
Are you okay?

10:31.580 --> 10:33.150
Yes, I'm fine.

10:33.270 --> 10:34.920
Are you sure I'm not
putting you out?

10:34.990 --> 10:37.650
Don't be silly!
75 miles is nothing!

10:37.670 --> 10:38.830
Bye, sweety!

10:44.300 --> 10:46.620
It was very nice meeting you,
Ms. Fisher.

10:46.940 --> 10:47.990
It was nice.

10:48.700 --> 10:51.060
Bye, hon!
Drive carefully!##

11:19.250 --> 11:20.840
Mary Fisher.

11:21.520 --> 11:24.210
Mary Fisher is pretty and rich...

11:24.530 --> 11:25.740
And thin!

11:26.100 --> 11:28.340
And writes best selling
books about love.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.090
Fortunately...

11:31.250 --> 11:32.910
I can trust my husband.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.350
My God, this is fantastic!

11:50.300 --> 11:51.820
You should see my
electricity bills.

11:52.100 --> 11:53.160
I'd love to!

11:53.950 --> 11:55.050
You have a moment?

12:07.040 --> 12:08.020
Garcia!

12:08.290 --> 12:09.380
I waited up for you.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.420
It wasn't necessary, grazie.
You may go to bed now.

12:12.490 --> 12:13.600
We'll be all right.

12:14.140 --> 12:15.140
Yes, ma'am.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.310
Would you care for a drink?

12:17.410 --> 12:18.290
I'd love one.

12:31.920 --> 12:32.780
Good night.

12:33.060 --> 12:34.960
Oh, yes! Good night!

12:35.710 --> 12:37.150
'Buenas noches!'

12:44.520 --> 12:47.130
You've got one hell of a
home office deduction, here!

12:47.500 --> 12:48.850
I don't know what you mean.

12:48.970 --> 12:49.830
Cognac?

12:49.870 --> 12:50.640
Sure!

12:50.830 --> 12:52.150
I just mean that
everything in this room...

12:52.180 --> 12:53.550
From floor to ceiling...

12:53.580 --> 12:55.480
Including that... Courvoisier...

12:55.500 --> 12:57.460
Is a tax writeoff.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.280
Is that...

12:59.700 --> 13:00.400
Good?

13:01.100 --> 13:03.010
Yeah!
It's great!

13:04.280 --> 13:06.490
I have not your head
for money matters at all.

13:06.510 --> 13:08.610
I just find it all so terribly, terribly...

13:10.190 --> 13:11.060
Confusing.

13:13.150 --> 13:15.130
You see, I try to think
only beautiful thoughts...

13:15.160 --> 13:17.040
Because then I think that
the beauty will...

13:17.570 --> 13:18.810
Come out in my work.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.960
You must lead a very
glamorous life, Mary.

13:26.450 --> 13:27.690
I suppose so, Bob...

13:28.680 --> 13:30.430
Sometimes sitting here...

13:30.940 --> 13:32.100
Day after day...

13:32.130 --> 13:34.400
Banging away at my keyboard...

13:37.600 --> 13:39.280
Writing can be so...

13:40.550 --> 13:41.880
So lonely.

13:47.090 --> 13:49.250
I guess you got to have a very
vivid imagination...

13:49.280 --> 13:51.190
To write this
romance novels, don't you?

13:53.450 --> 13:54.630
Yes, I do.

13:59.690 --> 14:01.310
But I also do a lot of...

14:03.420 --> 14:04.560
Research.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.260
" She entwined her
limbs about him..."

14:25.290 --> 14:28.650
"As ivy may wrap itself
around some massive pillar."

14:29.000 --> 14:30.830
"When his love nectar was spent..."

14:30.860 --> 14:33.560
"They drifted into the bliss of sleep."

14:56.190 --> 14:58.440
Maybe he had an accident
and got amnesia.

14:58.850 --> 15:00.190
Don't be a jerk!

15:00.340 --> 15:01.570
If he lost his memory...

15:01.590 --> 15:04.530
The people at the hospital
would just look in his wallet.

15:05.260 --> 15:07.190
And what if his car
slipped off the road...

15:07.420 --> 15:10.380
And he got smashed into
little bloody pieces?

15:10.500 --> 15:12.260
Stop talking like that!

15:12.610 --> 15:14.510
Andrew put that animal down!

15:15.280 --> 15:16.970
Your father drove someone home...

15:16.990 --> 15:19.660
And he probably just blew a tyre
on the expressway.

15:19.940 --> 15:21.260
And it got late...

15:24.870 --> 15:25.780
Bob!

15:26.110 --> 15:27.170
Is that you?

15:28.320 --> 15:29.410
Come on, Fuzzy.

15:29.860 --> 15:30.980
Hi, honey!

15:31.920 --> 15:33.000
Where were you?

15:33.030 --> 15:34.350
Oh, you'll never believe
what happened.

15:34.390 --> 15:35.960
I'm headed home on
the expressway...

15:36.070 --> 15:38.000
And KABUM!
The rear tyre blows up!

15:38.340 --> 15:39.820
By the time I got
the damn tyre changed...

15:39.890 --> 15:40.790
It was so late...

15:41.750 --> 15:43.860
I figured I'd better
check into a motel.

15:43.880 --> 15:46.740
You know, I certainly didn't
want to fall asleep at the wheel.

15:47.840 --> 15:48.710
How're you doing, champ?

15:48.740 --> 15:50.380
Why don't you call me?

15:51.820 --> 15:54.010
Oh, you want me to call at 4:30
and woke up the whole house?

15:54.040 --> 15:54.850
Come on!

15:54.880 --> 15:55.840
Good morning, princess!

15:55.870 --> 15:56.960
Good morning!

15:57.050 --> 15:58.160
Boy, am I hungry!

15:58.240 --> 16:00.060
You are in a good mood
this morning!

16:00.840 --> 16:02.430
By the way, I have got
some great news!

16:02.510 --> 16:04.310
I've landed the
Mary Fisher account!

16:06.030 --> 16:07.550
And that's just the beginning!

16:08.410 --> 16:09.710
With Mary Fisher
as my star client...

16:09.740 --> 16:11.200
I'm not just an
accountant, I am...

16:11.220 --> 16:12.360
Business manager!

16:12.440 --> 16:13.220
Daddy...

16:13.300 --> 16:14.510
Are we going to be rich?

16:14.530 --> 16:15.400
Right away, princess!

16:15.420 --> 16:17.200
- All right!
- All right!

16:23.290 --> 16:26.730
My husband is having an
affair with Mary Fisher!

16:27.420 --> 16:28.510
Ruth, how can you say that?

16:28.540 --> 16:30.460
I've always been totally
honest with you.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.010
You are my best friend!

16:32.680 --> 16:35.270
What's going on between me and Mary
is purely professional.

16:35.300 --> 16:38.100
I would never, ever do anything
to hurt you and the kids.

16:38.470 --> 16:39.940
Come on, honey!

16:41.310 --> 16:42.580
Trust me!

16:46.040 --> 16:49.980
Mary Fisher, I hope your
pink palace crumbles into the sea...

16:50.100 --> 16:52.910
I hope your delicate white skin
breaks up in hives...

16:52.940 --> 16:55.600
And your shiny blond hair
falls off at the roots!

16:57.950 --> 16:59.380
But meanwhile...

16:59.510 --> 17:00.580
I will watch...

17:00.990 --> 17:02.030
And wait.

17:03.580 --> 17:06.020
I will keep busy in
taking care of our home.

17:08.450 --> 17:11.010
I will try to look attractive
for my husband.

17:12.450 --> 17:14.349
Bob's just going into a phase...

17:14.520 --> 17:16.349
And when it's over, I'll be here.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.420
Ready and waiting for him.

17:19.369 --> 17:21.829
Mary Fisher, you are just a fling.

17:22.089 --> 17:24.660
A novelty, an infatuation.

17:25.010 --> 17:26.460
Bob doesn't love you!

17:26.540 --> 17:27.730
I love you!

17:38.660 --> 17:42.240
I know my husband better
than you ever will, Mary Fisher.

17:42.760 --> 17:45.090
And I know what to do
to win him back!

17:46.390 --> 17:47.870
"The art of winning back
your man...

17:47.940 --> 17:51.700
Is easy with these surefire
economical, sexy recipes.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.500
"The secret of
Chicken Vol-au-Vent...

17:53.520 --> 17:55.080
Is a delicate, puff pastry.

17:55.170 --> 17:56.770
The perfect appetizer
for this dish...

17:56.830 --> 17:59.460
Is a smooth, seductive,
mushroom soup."

18:00.040 --> 18:01.040
Gross!

18:01.060 --> 18:02.900
Your father loves
mushroom soup.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.320
We don't love it!

18:04.340 --> 18:05.840
We are eating too, aren't we?

18:05.960 --> 18:09.130
Yes, but tonight we want
to make your father very happy.

18:09.220 --> 18:10.030
Why?

18:10.190 --> 18:11.740
So he'll stay at home?

18:34.180 --> 18:35.380
Was that...

18:35.610 --> 18:37.170
Was that for real
or the wildest dreaming?

18:37.610 --> 18:38.850
If this is a dream...

18:39.190 --> 18:40.850
I don't ever want
to wake up.

18:46.270 --> 18:47.190
Wow...

18:47.210 --> 18:48.440
I know!

18:49.390 --> 18:50.990
What are you doing now?

18:51.010 --> 18:52.480
Oh, what are you now...?

18:57.120 --> 18:58.390
What are you doing?

18:58.500 --> 18:59.740
I got to go home!

19:00.580 --> 19:01.740
Already?

19:01.780 --> 19:03.630
Yeah... Myr parents
are coming home for dinner.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.680
I didn't realize that you
were so domestic.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.550
Come on, I got
to get home sometimes!

19:10.500 --> 19:11.200
No!

19:11.320 --> 19:12.680
You know you don't!

19:13.700 --> 19:15.710
You don't ever
have to go back, Bob.

19:15.990 --> 19:17.990
We fell in love!
It's no one's fault!

19:18.010 --> 19:20.280
It's not your fault.
It's not my fault.

19:21.030 --> 19:22.310
I know when you
married Ruth you...

19:22.460 --> 19:24.350
You did it out of
for kindness, and pity...

19:24.370 --> 19:25.740
And I love you for that...

19:25.900 --> 19:28.600
But Bob now, please, please...

19:29.780 --> 19:31.030
Be kind to me!

19:31.050 --> 19:34.240
Be with me, stay with me,
live with me!

19:34.360 --> 19:35.210
Mary...

19:35.330 --> 19:37.770
I want to but it's not that easy!
I've got kids!

19:37.800 --> 19:39.600
But they have their mother!

19:41.240 --> 19:43.290
Ruth is blessed
with those children...

19:43.590 --> 19:45.030
They're her pride and joy.

19:45.840 --> 19:47.420
It's not fair!

19:47.990 --> 19:49.130
What do I have?

19:49.150 --> 19:52.000
My all life is so empty!

19:52.420 --> 19:54.400
Don't you say that.
You've got me!

19:57.110 --> 19:59.350
I'm tired of sharing
you with her!

19:59.900 --> 20:01.280
Bob...

20:02.190 --> 20:04.730
I don't think I can stand
that much longer...

20:10.050 --> 20:12.040
I want all of you!

20:14.780 --> 20:15.850
I know.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.200
Damn, if I know.

20:34.270 --> 20:36.190
Hey, daddy is home!

20:39.110 --> 20:40.050
Hi, daddy!

20:40.510 --> 20:41.660
Hi, princess!

20:42.170 --> 20:43.440
Are you sleeping here tonight?

20:43.460 --> 20:45.020
Of course I am, sweety pie!

20:45.100 --> 20:47.550
Your grandparents are coming over,
we're going to have a nice family night.

20:47.570 --> 20:49.230
That ought to be unusual.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.610
Hey, Ruth, dinner
going to be ready on time?

20:51.700 --> 20:53.160
Yes, yes, it will.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.350
Hey, you were supposed
to be home an hour ago.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.940
I could have used some help.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.670
I'm sorry.
I got stuck in a meeting.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.340
I'm going to jump
in the shower.

21:14.910 --> 21:16.250
Oh, Jesus!

21:16.420 --> 21:17.400
Ruth!

21:17.970 --> 21:19.380
What the hell are you doing?

21:20.960 --> 21:22.020
Oh, please...

21:22.150 --> 21:22.840
Don't start now!

21:22.860 --> 21:24.470
My folks are going
to be here soon.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.780
I'm not starting anything.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.440
I'm... going to weigh myself...

21:27.480 --> 21:28.250
Yap!

21:28.550 --> 21:30.030
No wonder you're upset!

21:49.980 --> 21:51.210
Nothing's ready...

21:51.300 --> 21:52.420
And they're here!

21:54.210 --> 21:55.150
They're early.

21:55.180 --> 21:56.000
They're always early!

21:56.250 --> 21:57.880
Cheese and crackers,
that's it?

21:58.630 --> 22:00.790
The flans ought to be ready
in ten minutes.

22:01.100 --> 22:02.910
I'm doing
the best I can, Bob.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.810
Please don't embarrass me
in front of my folks.

22:13.280 --> 22:14.780
What are you doing
down there, son?

22:14.850 --> 22:17.040
- I can't find my gerbil.
- Really?

22:17.060 --> 22:19.070
Well, let grandpa
help you look for it!

22:19.100 --> 22:21.030
- Robin!
- Got to be 'round here somewhere!

22:21.560 --> 22:23.170
There she is!

22:35.670 --> 22:36.990
I've got it, hon!

22:37.190 --> 22:39.360
- Are you okay, dear?
- What's the matter with that woman?

22:39.720 --> 22:41.180
Herbie, are you under there?

22:41.610 --> 22:44.240
- She's clumsy as an ox!
- Is it that time of the month?

22:44.390 --> 22:45.210
Herbie?

22:45.540 --> 22:47.000
I'm going to get back
in the kitchen.

22:47.030 --> 22:48.050
Can I help you?

22:48.080 --> 22:48.860
Relax, mom.

22:48.880 --> 22:51.210
Ruth has got everything under
control, don't you honey?

22:52.560 --> 22:54.080
Andy, find him yet?

23:07.380 --> 23:10.100
Certainly these romantic novels
have universal appeal.

23:10.210 --> 23:11.310
They sell like crazy!

23:11.480 --> 23:12.680
Women... buy it.

23:13.290 --> 23:14.200
Ask Ruth.

23:14.550 --> 23:15.680
She's read everyone!

23:15.970 --> 23:18.060
Nicolette, will you clear
the salad dish, please?

23:18.300 --> 23:19.370
Do I have to?

23:19.490 --> 23:21.070
You men don't understand.

23:21.550 --> 23:22.930
It's always up to the woman...

23:22.960 --> 23:25.010
To keep the romance
in a relationship...

23:25.030 --> 23:26.430
I'm sure Ruth
reads these books...

23:26.460 --> 23:28.490
For inspiration, don't you Ruth?

23:29.270 --> 23:30.420
We don't need books.

23:30.890 --> 23:32.880
Ruth and I have a
terrific relationship.

23:32.980 --> 23:34.560
Always had, always will.

23:34.710 --> 23:35.870
Sure we have our problems...

23:35.990 --> 23:37.470
But it's a question
of give and take.

23:37.640 --> 23:39.220
Once you understand that...

23:39.330 --> 23:40.930
The romance takes care of itself.

23:41.160 --> 23:44.240
Bob, that's so very sensitive
coming from you!

23:44.290 --> 23:46.740
Ruth, I didn't know
he was so sensitive!

23:48.470 --> 23:49.870
Oh, my God!

23:49.950 --> 23:51.160
Herbie!

23:51.320 --> 23:52.480
I'm going to barf!

23:52.870 --> 23:55.020
Ruth, what the hell
is wrong with you?

23:55.050 --> 23:55.990
I'll go get a strainer.

23:56.010 --> 23:57.730
A strainer?
That's a dead rodent!

23:58.330 --> 23:59.580
Take it off the table!

23:59.600 --> 24:01.160
- Bob, calm down!
- Calm down?

24:01.190 --> 24:03.540
The woman is a walking
disaster area!

24:04.270 --> 24:06.270
Why don't you get Mary Fisher
to cook your dinner?

24:06.310 --> 24:07.470
Ruth, I warn you!

24:07.490 --> 24:09.010
She's his mistress, you know?

24:09.070 --> 24:10.220
Shut up, Ruth!

24:13.450 --> 24:14.800
You see what I have
to put up with?

24:15.250 --> 24:17.670
I'll never forgive you for being
so rude to my parents!

24:17.700 --> 24:19.250
Bob, don't be
so mean to her!

24:19.270 --> 24:21.140
Mean? She's the one
making my life miserable.

24:21.170 --> 24:22.500
I knew I never should've
married her!

24:22.530 --> 24:23.550
Bob, the children!

24:23.580 --> 24:25.840
Nicolette and Andy, go up
to your rooms, now, now, now!

24:25.870 --> 24:28.620
Bobby, Bobby, if you didn't love her,
you shouldn't have married her.

24:29.220 --> 24:30.960
Yeah, she was pregnant,
you made me!

24:30.990 --> 24:32.690
Marriage is never easy!

24:33.090 --> 24:34.580
With Ruth, it's not even possible!

24:34.640 --> 24:36.000
Come on, Brenda!
We'll eat out.

24:36.030 --> 24:39.300
That's a good idea, since half
your dinner is on the goddamn floor!

24:46.560 --> 24:49.030
I had every intention
to save this marriage.

24:49.770 --> 24:51.170
I'm tell you something, Ruth.

24:51.250 --> 24:54.170
Life is made up
of assets and liabilies.

24:54.200 --> 24:56.630
As a man I have
four basic assets...

24:56.670 --> 24:59.410
1: A home, that is my castle...

24:59.670 --> 25:02.770
2: A family, that is loving
and devoted...

25:02.810 --> 25:06.130
3: A successful career that
I worked very hard to maintain...

25:06.170 --> 25:09.130
And 4: The freedom to enjoy
the fruits of my labor.

25:09.160 --> 25:11.320
But when it comes to liabillities,
I have only one.

25:11.350 --> 25:12.650
That's you, Ruth!

25:13.250 --> 25:16.770
And I'm not gonna let you ruin everything
I've worked so hard for!

25:17.390 --> 25:18.460
You're a bad mother...

25:18.520 --> 25:19.490
A lousy wife...

25:19.580 --> 25:20.820
And a terrible cook!

25:21.020 --> 25:21.710
In fact...

25:21.740 --> 25:23.550
Have you looked
in a mirror recently?

25:24.040 --> 25:25.400
I don't even think
you're a woman!

25:25.570 --> 25:27.000
Do you know what you are?

25:27.290 --> 25:29.100
You are a she-devil!

26:25.410 --> 26:26.910
Mary Fisher.

26:27.610 --> 26:30.380
Mary Fisher lives in a palace
by the sea.

26:30.790 --> 26:33.630
She is pretty,
and rich and thin!

26:34.010 --> 26:36.750
And in love with my husband,
who's her accountant.

26:37.870 --> 26:39.300
I loved my husband...

26:42.510 --> 26:45.410
And I hate Mary Fisher!

27:04.600 --> 27:06.230
BOB's ASSETS
1. HOME

27:06.260 --> 27:08.120
2. FAMILY
3. CAREER

27:12.410 --> 27:13.700
4. FREEDOM

29:53.370 --> 29:55.090
He is cute, that kid.

29:58.330 --> 29:59.910
It blew up
and then fell down.

30:11.630 --> 30:13.240
Oh, my God!

30:13.310 --> 30:14.890
Mom, what happened?

30:15.410 --> 30:16.420
Well...

30:17.500 --> 30:19.360
We had a little accident.

30:22.580 --> 30:24.160
What about our clothes?

30:24.710 --> 30:25.670
Gone.

30:25.730 --> 30:27.510
- What about my toys?
- Gone.

30:27.540 --> 30:29.000
What about my tapes?

30:29.290 --> 30:31.150
Gone, everything is gone.

30:31.550 --> 30:33.140
Where are we going, Mom?

30:34.080 --> 30:35.220
Mom?

31:14.090 --> 31:14.890
Yes?

31:14.910 --> 31:16.900
I'm Mrs. Ruth Patchett.

31:17.270 --> 31:19.270
Children would like to see
their father.

31:23.010 --> 31:25.180
Oh, please come in.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.010
Why don't you just
go find your father.

31:28.050 --> 31:29.630
There's a door on the way,
to the right.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.190
This place is cool!

31:53.140 --> 31:53.990
Andy!

31:54.490 --> 31:56.130
I found him!

31:56.360 --> 31:57.550
Hi, daddy...

31:57.720 --> 31:59.330
Who let you in here?
Gracia?!

31:59.360 --> 32:01.810
Ruth, what the hell do
you think you're doing?

32:02.130 --> 32:03.980
Andy, Nicolette,
this is your new home...

32:04.010 --> 32:05.860
I'm sure you'll be
very happy here.

32:06.280 --> 32:08.110
Ruth, you are really
depraved!

32:08.150 --> 32:10.490
Someone get this strange
woman out of here!

32:10.560 --> 32:11.630
Garcia!

32:11.750 --> 32:13.230
You take care, kids.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.070
And remember,
no matter what...

32:15.130 --> 32:16.240
I love you both...

32:16.600 --> 32:17.600
Very much.

32:19.310 --> 32:20.100
Ruth!

32:20.530 --> 32:21.350
Ruth...

32:21.730 --> 32:23.130
If this is your idea
of a joke...

32:23.360 --> 32:24.780
It's not funny!

32:25.940 --> 32:27.960
Do you have
a satellite dish?

32:33.400 --> 32:34.240
Ruth!

32:34.380 --> 32:36.220
Ruth, take the children home!

32:36.330 --> 32:37.340
I can't.

32:37.580 --> 32:38.730
If you want to talk,
we'll meet for lunch...

32:38.760 --> 32:40.580
But the children belong
at home with their mother!

32:40.720 --> 32:43.040
You don't understand Bob.
There is no home.

32:43.070 --> 32:44.100
What are you talking about?

32:44.140 --> 32:45.930
The house is gone.
Burned down.

32:46.010 --> 32:48.530
- There's nothing left but ashes.
- I don't believe you.

32:48.550 --> 32:50.810
Well, call the insurance adjuster,
he'll tell you!

32:53.800 --> 32:54.710
Ruth!

32:55.300 --> 32:56.200
Ruth!

32:58.130 --> 32:59.010
Okay...

32:59.320 --> 33:00.270
Okay, Ruth!

33:00.540 --> 33:01.610
I'll give you a few days...

33:01.660 --> 33:03.210
Then you got to
come back for the kids.

33:03.350 --> 33:04.380
Where can I reach you?

33:04.400 --> 33:06.130
I'm not coming back, Bob.

33:06.380 --> 33:08.560
They'll have a much
better life here with you.

33:08.630 --> 33:10.310
Wait a minute, Ruth.
Where are you going?

33:10.330 --> 33:13.030
I don't know, Bob.
Into my future, I guess.

33:13.500 --> 33:14.330
Ruth!

33:15.050 --> 33:15.880
Ruth!

33:16.330 --> 33:17.210
Ruth!

33:17.870 --> 33:20.320
Goddammit! Ruth!

33:22.300 --> 33:23.210
Stop it!

33:37.790 --> 33:40.390
I will have to get used
to being alone now.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.600
It's not easy for a mother...

33:43.640 --> 33:45.730
To be separated
from her children.

33:46.760 --> 33:49.860
I'll bet Mary Fisher's mother
feels the same way.

33:52.050 --> 33:54.080
Maybe I can help
old Mrs. Fisher...

33:54.110 --> 33:56.030
Get reacquainted
with her daughter.

33:59.850 --> 34:00.690
Buy a rose?

34:00.720 --> 34:03.320
A beautiful rose
for a beautiful lady.

34:04.570 --> 34:05.890
But first...

34:06.660 --> 34:08.370
I will need a new name.

34:32.639 --> 34:34.420
The old are all the same.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.940
Allow them nothing!
Take a firm line!

34:36.960 --> 34:39.260
Remember, they're
no different than children.

34:39.420 --> 34:41.070
Are you used to
children, Miss Rose?

34:41.100 --> 34:41.639
Yes.

34:41.670 --> 34:44.070
Good, then you'll feel
right at home here.

34:44.420 --> 34:47.170
Oh, let me stress one thing
above all else.

34:47.270 --> 34:50.360
You must report any damp or
smelling beds immediately.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.560
- Do you mean...
- Incontinence!

34:52.929 --> 34:54.290
Bed wetters have no place...

34:54.310 --> 34:56.460
In the Golden Twilight Home!

34:57.320 --> 34:58.750
Walk this way, please.

35:02.820 --> 35:04.250
Are they sedated?

35:04.580 --> 35:07.600
Our angels would rather sleep
then be awake wondering why...

35:07.620 --> 35:09.390
Their families have
thrown them away...

35:09.430 --> 35:11.380
You can understand that,
can't you, Miss. Rose?

35:11.410 --> 35:12.420
Of course!

35:12.450 --> 35:14.050
Good afternoon,
Mrs. Trumper...

35:14.080 --> 35:16.510
Oh, Mrs. Hooper,
this is Vesta Rose...

35:16.540 --> 35:18.000
She's the new orderly.

35:18.630 --> 35:19.610
Hello!

35:21.030 --> 35:23.410
It's time for their medications.

35:31.390 --> 35:34.880
Nurse Hooper may be short,
but she's very devouted.

35:35.070 --> 35:36.780
Been with me for years!

35:37.330 --> 35:39.010
You'll take your orders
from her.

35:39.420 --> 35:40.650
Now go help her!

35:40.710 --> 35:42.150
Yes, Mrs. Trumper.

35:54.040 --> 35:55.990
That's it!
Good girl.

35:56.690 --> 35:57.760
Not good?

35:58.880 --> 36:00.300
Here we go.
Open up...

36:00.550 --> 36:01.370
Right!

36:02.820 --> 36:04.540
Okay, Mrs. Fisher...

36:04.740 --> 36:06.000
Open wide...

36:07.660 --> 36:09.790
- There we go.
- How are you, Mrs. Fisher?

36:09.990 --> 36:11.610
You look
very pretty today!

36:13.480 --> 36:15.080
All right now, Mrs Palmer...

37:11.720 --> 37:13.470
SEDATIVE

37:26.320 --> 37:27.990
MaxiLIFE

37:34.640 --> 37:38.830
Mary Fisher's mother has been enjoying
a long untroubled sleep...

37:39.510 --> 37:42.220
It was time to wake her up!

38:16.080 --> 38:17.490
Come on!

38:17.540 --> 38:18.970
Give me the ball!

38:19.000 --> 38:19.720
Yeah!

38:20.160 --> 38:20.890
Go!

38:21.980 --> 38:23.820
Come on, Ms. Wolinski!

38:24.700 --> 38:27.980
Vesta, what is going on here?

38:28.000 --> 38:29.430
Oh, is it not wonderful?

38:29.460 --> 38:31.700
I know what you been doing!

38:31.730 --> 38:33.930
The vitamins!
The workouts!

38:33.950 --> 38:35.290
It's against the rules!

38:35.830 --> 38:38.420
I'm going to
report you to Ms. Trumper...

38:38.450 --> 38:39.870
And then you'll be sorry!

38:39.890 --> 38:41.550
Oh, I don't think so!

38:42.410 --> 38:44.570
I have been sorry
my whole life...

38:44.590 --> 38:46.320
And by the looks of it,
so have you!

38:46.450 --> 38:48.160
So you do
whatever you want.

38:50.050 --> 38:51.700
But it's a shame now, Hooper...

38:51.980 --> 38:53.440
I always thought
that women like us...

38:53.460 --> 38:54.730
Should stick together.

38:57.290 --> 38:58.290
Let's go!

38:58.870 --> 39:00.420
Catch that ball!

39:01.580 --> 39:03.930
She knew her body as
if she'd had it for a millennium...

39:03.950 --> 39:07.190
And with an ease neither of them
had ever, ever, known...

39:07.440 --> 39:09.140
He reached for her...

39:09.310 --> 39:10.780
Come Juliet, Fuzzy!

39:10.840 --> 39:11.690
Nub...

39:18.740 --> 39:19.500
No.

39:26.260 --> 39:27.100
Love...

39:27.430 --> 39:28.290
Button...

39:38.850 --> 39:39.820
Nicolette!

39:41.420 --> 39:42.730
Nicolette...

39:44.340 --> 39:45.480
Nicolette!

39:46.130 --> 39:47.400
Nicolette!!

39:51.930 --> 39:52.840
Nicolette!

39:53.250 --> 39:54.330
Nicolette!

39:55.920 --> 39:57.230
I'll call you back later.

39:58.180 --> 39:59.580
You don't have to scream!

39:59.650 --> 40:00.380
I asked you...

40:00.620 --> 40:02.540
10 or 15 times not to...

40:03.090 --> 40:04.830
Play that thing... so loudly.

40:05.140 --> 40:07.860
And you damn know I don't approve
that you're talking on that party line!

40:07.940 --> 40:09.380
There's nothing else
to do around here.

40:13.190 --> 40:13.910
Hello!

40:13.950 --> 40:16.490
Mary, hi!
What's going on out there?

40:16.740 --> 40:19.720
I just spoked to your publisher
she's been trying to reach you.

40:19.740 --> 40:20.250
I know...

40:20.270 --> 40:21.140
The little Nicolette...

40:21.420 --> 40:23.120
Has been on the phone
all day long!

40:23.980 --> 40:25.450
Paula is very upset!

40:25.650 --> 40:28.080
She says the new manuscript
is two months overdue.

40:28.890 --> 40:31.800
You have no idea what
I have to put up with around here!

40:31.820 --> 40:34.720
The noise, the bickering,
the constant interruptions.

40:34.870 --> 40:37.010
I can barely even...
concentrate!

40:37.040 --> 40:38.330
And let alone create!

40:38.470 --> 40:42.170
Mary, Mary, the kids have been
through a very emotional experience...

40:42.770 --> 40:45.210
They need time to adjust
to the new environement.

40:45.440 --> 40:48.450
You're the stepmother, you got
to make them feel at home, Mary!

40:48.680 --> 40:49.710
Help them!

40:49.770 --> 40:51.120
Yes, I know!

40:52.080 --> 40:53.110
Andrew!

40:53.140 --> 40:54.490
Andrew, what are you doing?

40:55.140 --> 40:56.300
Andrew!

40:56.970 --> 40:59.510
Andrew, you leave
little Juliet alone!

40:59.550 --> 41:00.760
Mary, what's on?

41:01.010 --> 41:03.510
Your child and that mongrel
are molesting my dog.

41:04.310 --> 41:05.760
Andrew, did you hear me?

41:06.040 --> 41:06.950
Andrew...

41:07.040 --> 41:08.560
Throw that stick away
right now!

41:08.820 --> 41:09.800
Right now!

41:25.780 --> 41:26.720
Mary...

41:27.110 --> 41:28.180
Mary!

41:28.780 --> 41:29.890
Mary!

41:39.120 --> 41:41.420
It's time for your medication,
Mrs. Fisher..

41:41.460 --> 41:44.390
This is the stupidest piece of trash
I have ever read!

41:44.470 --> 41:45.830
How are you today, dear?

41:45.880 --> 41:47.460
How the hell do I look?

41:47.830 --> 41:50.930
- Better, dear, much better.
- Well, I'm bored to death!

41:51.290 --> 41:53.580
Folk can go crazy
in a place like this!

41:54.080 --> 41:57.260
Well, how about some nice
hearthy beef barley?

41:57.290 --> 41:59.300
Oh, you know
I hate this slop!

42:04.420 --> 42:06.520
You think you can
slip me a beer?

42:15.050 --> 42:17.010
Mary Fisher, any relation?

42:17.180 --> 42:18.330
My daughter!

42:18.500 --> 42:21.180
- Oh how nice!
- She's a slut!

42:21.420 --> 42:23.110
Bitch keeps me
in this dogpound...

42:23.140 --> 42:24.810
While she lives the
life of a princess...

42:24.840 --> 42:26.260
In her goddamn mansion!

42:26.720 --> 42:28.580
Why, that doesn't seem fair!

42:28.600 --> 42:30.730
Yeah I ought to drop in
on her one day...

42:30.790 --> 42:32.820
That'd scare the shit
out of her.

42:32.960 --> 42:34.280
You have rights.

42:34.360 --> 42:37.550
If you wanted to go see your daughter
nobody could stop you.

42:37.930 --> 42:39.360
I'm too old!

42:39.980 --> 42:42.850
You are a mature and
vibrant woman...

42:43.010 --> 42:45.270
And don't you let anybody
tell you anything different.

42:45.390 --> 42:46.270
Yeah?

42:46.330 --> 42:48.920
I suppose I could go
on Sunday afternoon!

42:49.000 --> 42:51.020
I'll put you
on the train myself.

42:51.090 --> 42:54.130
And I'll even call ahead to make sure
the butler knows you're coming.

42:54.390 --> 42:55.580
Butler?

42:55.990 --> 42:58.000
I'll bet there's
hanky panky there!

42:58.500 --> 43:00.380
Well there's only
one way to find out!

43:36.690 --> 43:37.820
- All right?
- Come with me.

43:38.590 --> 43:39.250
All right!

43:39.280 --> 43:40.180
- Here we go!
- Okay.

43:40.210 --> 43:41.340
- Coming your way!
Lift it up!

43:42.840 --> 43:44.220
Kill her!
Allright!

43:44.250 --> 43:46.270
Trash her!
Come on!

43:46.560 --> 43:47.360
Yes!

43:47.390 --> 43:48.570
Kill her again!

43:48.680 --> 43:50.230
Crush her!

43:50.300 --> 43:51.530
Go! Yes!

43:53.270 --> 43:54.530
What a pigsty!

43:55.040 --> 43:56.000
Andrew!

43:56.310 --> 43:57.370
Nicolette!

43:58.010 --> 44:00.340
In this house we do not eat
in the living room!

44:00.850 --> 44:02.850
That's my blouse!
You're wearing my blouse!

44:02.880 --> 44:04.310
I have no clean clothes!

44:04.920 --> 44:06.270
Do the laundry, then!

44:06.300 --> 44:08.680
I'm sure your little brother
will be happy to help you.

44:09.030 --> 44:10.090
I don't know how.

44:10.720 --> 44:12.230
- Oh, yeah!
- Andrew, don't...

44:12.530 --> 44:14.040
Ever kick me again!

44:14.490 --> 44:16.320
- Come back here!
- That's it!

44:16.780 --> 44:18.980
Now, go upstairs and
clean your rooms.

44:19.500 --> 44:20.750
Tell the maid to do it!

44:20.840 --> 44:21.910
You shit!

44:22.420 --> 44:23.750
- Shit!
- Ute! Ute!

44:23.800 --> 44:25.480
- Shit!
- Ute!

44:26.000 --> 44:27.690
Ute, the children...

44:27.750 --> 44:29.670
Don't seem to have
any clean clothes!

44:29.860 --> 44:30.890
Do you think
that you could pos...

44:30.920 --> 44:33.270
Fuzzy has just shit
all over the carpet!

44:33.550 --> 44:35.960
Or perhaps Miss Fisher
would like to clean that up?

44:35.990 --> 44:37.330
And Ute will do the laundry?

44:37.360 --> 44:38.870
No, no, no, that's all right!

44:39.190 --> 44:40.230
Where is Garcia?

44:40.250 --> 44:42.050
In the swimming pool,
where else?

44:43.400 --> 44:44.420
García!

44:50.180 --> 44:51.130
García!

44:54.140 --> 44:56.380
García, what the hell do
you think you're doing?

44:56.520 --> 44:58.040
I'm not really sure.

44:58.620 --> 45:00.730
Lately I haven't been able
to perform my...

45:00.750 --> 45:01.960
Usual services.

45:02.030 --> 45:02.850
Well!

45:03.000 --> 45:04.690
You are still the butler...

45:05.500 --> 45:07.350
So get in there
and get to work!

45:07.580 --> 45:09.410
I may be the butler...

45:09.650 --> 45:11.610
But I'm not the maid!

45:47.500 --> 45:50.450
Would somebody please
get the door?

45:55.220 --> 45:58.170
Would somebody please
get the goddamn door?

46:04.700 --> 46:05.540
Scuzzy...

46:05.720 --> 46:06.630
Fuzzy.

46:07.480 --> 46:08.750
Get away! Get away!

46:10.820 --> 46:12.840
- Mother?
- Hello, Your Royal Highness!

46:12.860 --> 46:14.440
You better pay for the taxi.

46:15.980 --> 46:17.390
What are you doing here?

46:20.130 --> 46:22.100
Fancy schmancy!

46:23.420 --> 46:24.660
He's cute!

46:24.900 --> 46:26.460
How much
do you pay him?

46:26.780 --> 46:29.260
I'll bet she makes you
earn every penny, huh?

46:58.860 --> 47:00.310
Where are the children?

47:00.470 --> 47:01.290
They're getting ready

47:01.310 --> 47:02.930
Hey, kids!
Dinner is ready!

47:02.960 --> 47:05.470
Bob, we don't shout
at the dinner table.

47:08.020 --> 47:09.180
Here they are!

47:10.920 --> 47:12.540
Oh, don't you look...

47:13.160 --> 47:14.980
What's the matter
with your clothes?

47:15.330 --> 47:16.730
You did the laundry!

47:16.840 --> 47:17.510
I...

47:17.770 --> 47:19.700
Think something's wrong
with that machine.

47:22.850 --> 47:23.910
Here she is!

47:24.740 --> 47:26.690
Where the hell
is the chow line?

47:27.410 --> 47:28.690
Good evening, Mrs. Fisher...

47:28.730 --> 47:30.430
Andy, wont you get out of...
sit in another chair.

47:31.320 --> 47:32.530
Thanks, Gomez!

47:32.830 --> 47:33.480
It's Bob!

47:33.510 --> 47:36.290
Wathever! Why the hell didn't
anyone call me for dinner?

47:36.650 --> 47:39.810
Well, we thought that you
were having a little nap, mother.

47:39.840 --> 47:41.410
We didn't want to disturb you.

47:41.480 --> 47:43.640
Nap? I was in the toilet
the last half hour...

47:43.670 --> 47:45.530
I've got...
turboconstipation!

47:46.590 --> 47:47.810
She's great!

47:48.160 --> 47:49.210
Yeah...

47:50.830 --> 47:51.560
Well...

47:51.580 --> 47:52.980
Here we're all together...

47:53.000 --> 47:55.440
Having a nice family dinner.

47:55.750 --> 47:56.910
We certainly are!

47:57.550 --> 47:58.960
Pretty fancy, eh kids?

48:00.270 --> 48:01.310
What is it?

48:01.990 --> 48:04.270
It's Potage Crème de Cresson.

48:04.880 --> 48:06.200
What's that?

48:06.470 --> 48:08.320
It's French for dog puke.

48:11.110 --> 48:12.900
Actually it's cream...

48:13.420 --> 48:15.020
Of watercress.

48:15.770 --> 48:16.990
Well, it's delicious.

48:18.120 --> 48:19.220
You know Mrs. Fisher...

48:19.320 --> 48:21.210
I haven't told you what a
wonderful daughter you've got.

48:21.240 --> 48:23.080
You did a terrific job
in raising her.

48:23.150 --> 48:25.150
You'd never know
with the way she treets me...

48:25.230 --> 48:27.160
The 'famous writer¨' over there...

48:27.290 --> 48:29.200
You'd think a 41 year old woman...

48:29.230 --> 48:31.480
Would have learnt
to appreciate her mother!

48:31.540 --> 48:33.120
You'd think that her
mother would appreciate...

48:33.140 --> 48:35.030
The very expensive nursing
home her daughter...

48:35.080 --> 48:36.280
Pays for!

48:36.770 --> 48:37.590
Mary, I...

48:37.660 --> 48:38.990
I thought you were 34!

48:39.880 --> 48:41.150
Ah, she's 41...

48:41.180 --> 48:43.270
I got the birth certificate
to prove it!

48:43.370 --> 48:44.900
Don't listen to her!

48:44.930 --> 48:46.710
She's getting senile...

48:46.880 --> 48:48.800
Bullshit!
I remember everything!

48:48.900 --> 48:51.170
I remember when you were
just a teenager!

48:51.200 --> 48:52.730
I'm not interested in
what you remember!

48:52.750 --> 48:53.960
Will you shut up!

49:05.350 --> 49:07.590
You may clear
the first course, García.

49:15.470 --> 49:16.880
How's your lunch, Hooper?

49:19.100 --> 49:20.370
Adequate, thank you.

49:57.250 --> 49:58.710
Try one!

50:19.730 --> 50:21.190
Tell me something, Hooper.

50:21.220 --> 50:22.520
How long have
you been here?

50:25.700 --> 50:27.820
- Twenty-two years.
- Really?

50:28.440 --> 50:30.090
You must like it here.

50:31.210 --> 50:32.230
Well, I...

50:32.650 --> 50:34.200
Can't say that I do, but...

50:34.310 --> 50:36.200
I guess it's what I'm used to.

50:37.690 --> 50:40.690
Yeah, well, you can get used
to anything, if you have to.

50:40.780 --> 50:42.560
But I'm not going
to stay here...

50:42.850 --> 50:43.870
Forever.

51:11.450 --> 51:15.220
Hooper, there's
over 55.000 dollars here!

51:15.260 --> 51:15.770
Well...

51:15.820 --> 51:17.590
I don't really have
any expenses...

51:17.620 --> 51:19.950
Almost everything I make
goes into the bank!

51:20.010 --> 51:22.460
What are you going to do
with all this money?

51:24.230 --> 51:25.880
I haven't given that
much thought!

51:26.520 --> 51:30.670
Hooper, money has no value
if you don't put it to good use!

51:34.470 --> 51:36.390
What would you do
with this much money?

51:36.540 --> 51:38.290
Oh, I could think of something!

51:43.270 --> 51:45.100
Hooper! Vesta!

51:47.590 --> 51:49.380
This, is long-term leaking!

51:49.500 --> 51:51.000
How long has this
been going on?

51:51.360 --> 51:52.770
I didn't want to tell you...

51:52.790 --> 51:54.030
Poor Mrs. Fisher, she...

51:54.060 --> 51:55.740
No excuses!
You're fired!

51:56.000 --> 51:59.120
Hooper, get some disinfectant
and clean down this bed!

51:59.200 --> 52:00.020
Now!

52:00.080 --> 52:01.940
Where is Mrs. Fisher?

52:06.970 --> 52:09.530
Mother, your train leaves at 3,
shouldn't you be packing?

52:10.030 --> 52:11.470
Can't wait to get rid
of me, huh?

52:11.510 --> 52:12.250
Let's...

52:12.280 --> 52:13.690
Not get paranoid, shall we?

52:18.310 --> 52:19.750
How do you do?

52:20.140 --> 52:22.870
I'm... so thrilled...
that People Magazine...

52:22.900 --> 52:24.540
Wants to do
an article about me.

52:24.570 --> 52:27.530
Oh, it's long
overdue, Miss Fisher...

52:27.550 --> 52:28.840
Mary. Please!

52:28.860 --> 52:30.060
Thank you!

52:30.270 --> 52:32.240
Chris would like
to take some pictures...

52:32.260 --> 52:33.550
Of your beautiful palace.

52:33.570 --> 52:34.780
By all means.

52:40.990 --> 52:42.160
García, what is this?

52:42.320 --> 52:44.190
Tea time as usual, ma'm.

52:45.080 --> 52:46.620
No...
No, No, No...

52:50.070 --> 52:52.130
Let me start
with a real tuffy!

52:52.520 --> 52:54.990
Some critics charge
that your books...

52:55.040 --> 52:58.060
Are nothing more than
soft core porn...

52:58.090 --> 52:59.370
For bored housewifes.

53:00.770 --> 53:02.630
Well, those critics
are usually men.

53:03.510 --> 53:04.550
It's silly! My...

53:04.630 --> 53:06.450
Books reflect
my own experiences...

53:06.480 --> 53:08.450
Of lovemaking
as sacred and beautiful.

53:09.240 --> 53:10.340
Something...

53:10.710 --> 53:11.640
Special...

53:11.820 --> 53:13.730
To be shared and treasured.

53:14.250 --> 53:15.380
You!

53:16.210 --> 53:17.630
Phone call!

53:22.200 --> 53:23.430
- Would you excuse me?
- Sure!

53:29.810 --> 53:32.670
The issue, here,
is bladder control.

53:32.770 --> 53:35.130
Look, I said I'll pay extra
for the inconvenience.

53:35.460 --> 53:38.690
Incontinence is more than
an inconvenience.

53:38.820 --> 53:41.030
Your mother is
no longer welcome here.

53:41.190 --> 53:43.130
Well, what am I
supposed to do with her?

53:43.280 --> 53:45.780
What I've done with her
for the past 10 years!

53:45.860 --> 53:46.950
Put up with her!

53:48.050 --> 53:49.180
But I'm not...

53:49.530 --> 53:50.450
A nurse!

53:50.560 --> 53:53.460
She doesn't need nursing!
She needs T.L.C.

53:54.790 --> 53:56.330
What is that?
A new drug?

53:57.100 --> 53:58.870
Tender, Loving, Care!

53:58.930 --> 54:01.330
Something that I'm sure you,
as her daughter...

54:01.500 --> 54:02.530
Can provide.

54:02.830 --> 54:04.200
Goodday, Miss Fisher!

54:08.850 --> 54:11.000
Are you saying that
she was promiscuous?

54:11.290 --> 54:12.230
Promiscuous?

54:12.250 --> 54:14.830
She was a teen-aged tramp!
She couldn't get enough!

54:15.040 --> 54:18.310
She would do it anywhere,
anytime, and with anyone!

54:18.740 --> 54:20.630
She got knocked up
when she was sixteen!

54:20.650 --> 54:21.690
Really?

54:22.020 --> 54:22.920
Couldn't keep it though.

54:22.960 --> 54:25.900
She had to put that cute little
baby boy up for adoption!

54:25.980 --> 54:26.760
A boy?

54:27.400 --> 54:28.300
Chris!

54:28.350 --> 54:29.380
Come here!

54:30.400 --> 54:32.550
Are you saying,
there's a missing heir...

54:32.600 --> 54:34.420
To the Fisher family
Royal Dynasty?

54:34.470 --> 54:35.460
Royal my ass!

54:35.500 --> 54:37.960
Her father was a kosher butcher
from Hoboken.

54:38.060 --> 54:39.350
A lovely man!

54:42.870 --> 54:44.190
Now, where were we?

54:44.680 --> 54:45.650
So!

54:46.140 --> 54:47.610
Tell me about your son!

54:47.830 --> 54:48.890
Miss Fisher...

54:49.140 --> 54:50.360
Smile!

55:01.860 --> 55:04.360
My work at the
Golden Twilight was over...

55:04.670 --> 55:07.890
So I appointed Mrs. Wolinski
captain of the soccer team...

55:07.960 --> 55:09.530
And wished them all good luck.

55:13.760 --> 55:17.590
It was now time to move on
to the next stage of my plan...

55:52.430 --> 55:53.630
Rose!

55:54.430 --> 55:55.680
Stop!

55:56.070 --> 55:57.310
Vesta!

55:57.800 --> 56:01.420
Stop, stop!
Stop, please!

56:04.780 --> 56:05.850
Thank you!

56:15.210 --> 56:16.510
What are you doing?

56:17.900 --> 56:18.990
I don't know!

56:19.670 --> 56:20.660
I thought...

56:20.740 --> 56:22.530
You might have a plan.

56:25.130 --> 56:26.960
Oh, I had plan all right...

56:27.150 --> 56:29.400
And I was glad to have
Hooper as a partner.

56:30.580 --> 56:33.410
She was hard-working,
loyal, honest...

56:34.030 --> 56:35.680
And eager to invest her money...

56:35.710 --> 56:37.510
Where it would do
the most good.

56:47.010 --> 56:49.820
Come on, you got to use
a little imagination here!

56:49.880 --> 56:50.750
Look at this!

56:50.800 --> 56:53.690
It got westerly exposure,
beautiful views...

56:54.310 --> 56:55.870
I could get
a fortune for it!

56:55.940 --> 56:57.570
The neighborhood is very hot!

56:57.890 --> 57:00.470
But, you seem like
a nice couple of girls...

57:00.560 --> 57:02.820
The place could use
a woman's touch, so...

57:02.960 --> 57:04.400
I'll give you a good deal!

57:05.550 --> 57:06.680
What do you think?

57:10.430 --> 57:12.570
WHOLE BUILDING FOR SALE OR LEASE

57:57.900 --> 58:02.220
I was starting an employment agency
for the unloved and the unwanted...

58:02.820 --> 58:05.730
Women like Hooper whom
the world had thrown away.

58:06.400 --> 58:08.660
And I knew just where
to find them.

58:53.770 --> 58:55.900
GET THE JOB YOU DESERVE!
COME TO VESTA ROSE - TODAY -

58:59.660 --> 59:02.110
All these women needed was
a little support...

59:02.140 --> 59:04.800
And encouragement
to turn their lives around.

59:06.220 --> 59:08.610
They would become my own
personal army.

59:09.630 --> 59:11.810
Ready for action
when I needed them.

59:15.860 --> 59:18.240
You see, my husband
just left me...

59:18.400 --> 59:19.730
And I got three kids.

59:19.940 --> 59:21.970
I've never had
a real job before.

59:22.690 --> 59:25.990
Well, taking care of three kids
sounds like a real job to me!

59:26.800 --> 59:27.670
Yeah...

59:28.350 --> 59:30.850
I'm sure you don't have anything
for someone like me, but...

59:31.090 --> 59:32.590
I had nowhere else to go...

59:32.610 --> 59:33.600
So I figured...

59:33.710 --> 59:34.810
What the heck!

59:35.020 --> 59:37.150
Well, do you have any
office skills?

59:37.900 --> 59:38.840
No...

59:39.660 --> 59:42.420
But I did do all my husband's
bookkeeping at home!

59:42.530 --> 59:43.570
See?

59:44.010 --> 59:46.260
Now, I'm sure we can find
something for you.

59:46.640 --> 59:49.390
You be here tomorrow
morning at 8:30 sharp.

59:51.260 --> 59:52.270
Thank you!

59:52.560 --> 59:54.030
Thank you so much!

59:55.870 --> 59:57.680
Welcome to Vesta Rose!

01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:10.410
Feeling useless?

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.200
Think you have
nothing to offer?

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:16.430
Were you voted
"Less likely to Success?"

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.700
Then you're just
the person we're looking for!

01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:23.840
Wether you're returning
to the workforce...

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:25.340
Or just starying out...

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.280
Unhappy with your present job...

01:00:27.310 --> 01:00:29.960
Or just looking for
a change of pace...

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.790
Vesta Rose is the place for you!

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.890
Because at Vesta Rose...

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:36.250
We believe...

01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:39.540
People are more
than just their jobs!

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:42.170
Come bloom with us!

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:03.600
Some things never change.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Bob was certainly
moving up in the world...

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.420
But like any man
who runs a growing business...

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:14.780
He always had an eye up for
qualified personnel.

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:17.930
Well, Bob...

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.110
Feast your eyes on this!

01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:25.150
Hi! I'm looking for
a personal assistant/bookkeeper...

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.980
Someone with a good head
on their shoulders...

01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:29.560
Someone who's a working knowledge
of profit and loss statements...

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:31.720
Someone who knows
her way around a computer.

01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:33.640
I'm not opposed
to working with someone...

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:35.380
Extremely attractive.

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:38.530
What do you prefer,
a man or a woman?

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.940
A man...

01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:41.490
A woman, of course!

01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:42.740
Okie dokie...

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:45.810
If you just give me your name and
the name of your company...

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:48.530
Yeah! Robert Patchett,
the Patchett Organization.

01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:50.230
Yes, thank you!

01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:55.130
In order to run
a successful agency...

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.170
It's important to match
the right employer...

01:01:58.220 --> 01:01:59.900
With the right employee.

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:03.600
Men go crazy
when I tell them my name.

01:02:03.790 --> 01:02:05.460
It's... Olivia Honey.

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.470
They think it's so cute!

01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:09.460
But it is, isn't it?

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:12.010
As you can see
from my resume...

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.800
I'm an expert bookkeeper
and data processor...

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.490
And my goal...

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:19.560
My goal is to work for a
powerful, successful man...

01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:21.240
Who makes lots of money...

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:23.530
And marry him!

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:28.070
Olivia was too good to be true.

01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:32.570
She'd give Mary Fisher
a taste of her own medicin!

01:02:52.890 --> 01:02:54.020
Hello, there!

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.270
Hello!

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.370
I'm Olivia...

01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:59.450
The agency sent me over to interview
for the bookkeeping position?

01:03:01.450 --> 01:03:02.810
You're hired!

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:06.240
Oh oh, Paula!

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.320
- Darling!
- Mary...

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:11.970
How are you?

01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:15.360
I'm sorry I'm late!
I was stuck in the traffic.

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:18.010
- It's crazy time out there.
- Relax!

01:03:20.170 --> 01:03:21.510
The usual please, Henri.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:26.450
What?

01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:28.730
- What's wrong?
- In your hair!

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:32.970
A gummy bear!

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:35.490
So!

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.120
Tell me... how much you love
my new novel...

01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:40.930
And how much money
we're going to make!

01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:43.880
I don't know
what to say, Mary.

01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:45.910
We extended
deadline after deadline...

01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:48.180
Waiting patiently
for yor manuscript.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:51.840
Then you give us something called
"Love In The Rinse Cycle"?

01:03:53.590 --> 01:03:55.040
You mean you don't love it?

01:03:55.110 --> 01:03:57.940
Mary, the love scenes
are wanderful...

01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.450
But your heroine
has two children...

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.920
And has a husband
named... Bob!

01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:05.810
- I don't understand at all!
- Darling!

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.630
What is this all chapter
on laundry?

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.270
It's a metaphor, Paula.

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:11.950
A what?

01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:13.910
A metaphor!

01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:17.500
Women always get stuck
with the laundry!

01:04:17.530 --> 01:04:19.410
My readers will identify.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:22.200
Mary, in the romance business...

01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:24.680
You're only as good
as your last novel.

01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:26.350
Fans are fickle!

01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:28.730
Disappoint them once
and they will feel betrayed.

01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:30.080
You will lose them!

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:33.280
Don't lecture me
about my readers!

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:37.060
Are you going
to publish it, or not?

01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:38.770
Not as is!

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:39.770
Fine!

01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:41.040
- You see, Mary, we're only doing this...
- Fine!

01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:41.990
- For your own...
- Fine!

01:04:42.010 --> 01:04:43.070
I'm exercising my option...

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:45.020
I'm going to take it to
another publisher, Paula.

01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:46.520
Mary...

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:49.870
Why don't you take a day
to think about this?

01:04:50.110 --> 01:04:52.380
You look tired!

01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:53.910
Go get a facial!

01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:55.360
Is there something wrong?

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:56.710
How...

01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:57.810
Dare you...

01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:59.310
To patronize me?

01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:07.130
And by the way...

01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:08.250
I think that...

01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:09.480
Bob...

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.660
Is a beautiful name!

01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:24.720
Taxi!

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:27.270
Taxi!

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.470
ROMANCE QUEEN UNSAVOURY SECRETS
- MOM TELLS ALL -

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.190
Please, Please, Taxi!

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.100
DETHRONING
THE QUEEN OF ROMANCE

01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:55.350
HOW TO HAVE A BABY
WHEN YOU WANT TO

01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:28.630
Mary Fisher.

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.840
Mary Fisher lives in a palace
by the sea.

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.620
But her life is no longer
a fairy tale.

01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:39.800
Now that Prince Charming
works late every night.

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:44.940
Bob?

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:46.010
Bob...

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:47.570
This is...

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:48.960
Bob, are you there?

01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:50.130
Can't you pick up?

01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:53.270
Honey, please, please, please,
pick up!

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:40.350
Bob?

01:08:42.899 --> 01:08:43.770
Bob?

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.229
Is that you, just...?

01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:46.970
Darling?

01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:49.069
I was calling, and calling,
and calling...

01:08:49.090 --> 01:08:50.240
Where were you?

01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:51.350
Sorry, honey...

01:08:51.370 --> 01:08:54.090
That freaking Jag
blew a fan belt on the way in...

01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:56.170
Oh, I'm so pissed!

01:08:57.130 --> 01:08:58.460
You know
what I'm thinking?

01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:00.300
I'm thinking...

01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:03.390
That ride from the city
is so long...

01:09:03.529 --> 01:09:05.300
It might be safer if I spent...

01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:06.590
A few nights...

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:07.540
In the office.

01:09:07.569 --> 01:09:08.359
What do you think?

01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:10.790
I think that you
should take a look at this!

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.069
Jesus Christ!

01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:16.250
We're going to sue
the bastards!

01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:18.000
Hold on, Mary, who are
you going to sue?

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.560
Your mother?

01:09:20.479 --> 01:09:21.120
No.

01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:24.210
I'll wring her
scaly little neck.

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:26.000
Okay, okay,
we'll just look at the bright side...

01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:28.229
Even bad publicity
is good publicity.

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:29.910
We're going to need
all the help we can get...

01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:31.750
When "Love In The Rinse Cycle"
comes out.

01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:32.670
What...

01:09:33.069 --> 01:09:34.390
May I ask...

01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:35.840
Do you mean by that?

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:38.319
I read the manuscript,
frankly Mary, I'm worried.

01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:40.210
Why?
Why?

01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:42.770
Why is everyone turning
against me now?

01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:45.529
First Paula refuses
to publish it!

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:48.790
Now you tell me
you hate it!

01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:50.580
I don't hate it...

01:09:50.609 --> 01:09:53.830
I just don't know why you
strayed from the formula!

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:55.920
Because I...

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:58.560
If you don't know it, Bob...

01:09:58.590 --> 01:09:59.710
Am an artist!

01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:03.830
And ever since
you came to my house...

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:05.720
With the children
my life has changed...

01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:09.660
And I must reflect that
in my... writing.

01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:12.000
Mary...

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:15.860
Let's, let's not exaggerate
the significance of you writing, okay...

01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:18.430
We're not talking about art here.
We're talking about a product!

01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:19.610
- A product?!
- Yeah!

01:10:20.150 --> 01:10:23.410
When did I mention you know
about literature, art, or creativity?

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:25.260
After all you are merely...

01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:28.790
An accountant!

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.030
Yes, but accounting
can be very creative!

01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:33.900
Yeah, that's what our friends
are telling me!

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:34.800
Yeah!

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:36.690
If I didn't keep my eye
on the bottom line...

01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:39.540
You and all your artist friends
wouldn't have a pot to piss in!

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.070
You are so vulgar!

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:43.920
So gross!

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.430
How dare you insult my...

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:48.200
Beautiful friends?

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:51.030
Because that
is the real world, Mary...

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:53.870
So wake up
and smell the cappuccino!

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:54.800
No!

01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:56.100
- No!
- Goodnight!

01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:58.090
Where are you going, darling?

01:10:58.190 --> 01:10:59.300
No! No!

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:02.140
No, no, no, no!

01:11:07.050 --> 01:11:08.830
Sad Mary Fisher!

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.650
She's learning that men
who burn so hot for a mistress...

01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:16.220
Cool out fast when the mistress
starts acting like a wife.

01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:48.380
Oh, Bob!

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:52.370
Oh, darling!

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:57.360
Aw, yes!

01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:59.130
Oh, yes!

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.010
I love you!

01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:05.600
I think you really...

01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:07.340
Yes, I do!

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:21.860
Oh, God!

01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:33.110
He is such
an incredible lover!

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:35.450
I mean, it's more
than just sex!

01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:38.060
You have no idea
how nice he is!

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.760
Sounds like love.

01:12:39.970 --> 01:12:41.260
I don't know!

01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:42.660
Is he married?

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.130
So he was, but...

01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:46.600
She ran off and left him
with the kids!

01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:48.260
I mean,
can you imagine it?

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:50.500
Sounds a bit like she was
a real nut, huh?

01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:53.000
Oh, that must have been
tough on him!

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.000
Yeah!

01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:56.790
He lives with someone now,
but that's on the rocks!

01:12:56.910 --> 01:12:59.850
You know, it's just for showing you
how he felt about me.

01:12:59.970 --> 01:13:02.600
What have you told him?
This what's his name?

01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:03.610
Bobby.

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:06.390
Have you told Bobby
how you feel?

01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:08.010
Oh, I can't!

01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:09.520
I mean, it's not like that.

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:10.870
He's so...

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:12.070
I don't know...

01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:13.010
Important!

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.640
But Olivia, so are you!

01:13:16.290 --> 01:13:18.180
You should tell him
how you feel!

01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:19.670
Do you really think so?

01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:21.620
Why, you don't want him
to think that you do...

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:23.530
This sort of things
all the time!

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.660
No!

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.370
But, I mean,
I can't come right out and say...

01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:29.460
'I love you, Bobby.'
I mean...

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.290
What if I scare him off
or something?

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:35.400
Oh, now you
listen to me, Olivia!

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.130
How could tell your man
that you love him...

01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:39.980
Possibly scare him off?

01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:46.970
Oh, Bobby!

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:50.570
Catch me if you can!

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.230
Wait, where are you going?

01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:56.050
Come here!

01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:59.570
Come on,
come on up on the desk!

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:00.870
Up on the desk.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.630
I have an idea!

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.870
We go for a ride!

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:08.450
It's picture time!

01:14:09.150 --> 01:14:10.160
Goody!

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.630
Say cheese!

01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:29.670
Oh, Bobby!

01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:31.330
It's so funny!

01:14:31.450 --> 01:14:32.650
And sweet, you know?

01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:34.970
This isn't just a fling for me,
you know?

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:36.220
What's that?

01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:38.610
I love you Bobby, I do!

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:41.220
I really, truly, love you.

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:53.580
I told him I loved him,
and fired me!

01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:55.470
He accused me of...

01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:58.610
Of trying
to sleep my way to the top.

01:14:59.090 --> 01:15:02.820
Aw, it sounds like he really
took advantage of you!

01:15:03.190 --> 01:15:04.140
Yeah!

01:15:04.170 --> 01:15:06.000
You know, it's like
you give men what they want...

01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:08.000
And then they don't
want it anymore!

01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:10.900
I can't believe
I trusted him!

01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:14.040
Well, maybe you were
a little naive, but...

01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:17.630
He certainly seemed like a nice guy,
an honest businessman...

01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:20.160
Honest?
You got to be kidding me!

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.180
He cheats his own clients!

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:23.740
He does?

01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:26.680
How?

01:15:27.930 --> 01:15:30.280
Oh, he skims the interest
off their accounts...

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:32.240
And wires it
to a bank in Switzerland.

01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:35.370
Ah, what a slime ball!

01:15:36.230 --> 01:15:37.470
It's not fair.

01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:39.510
Men get away
with murder, you know!

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:43.330
It seems like if you are a woman
there's just no justice in the world.

01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:45.430
Well, I always found that...

01:15:45.450 --> 01:15:48.500
Justice serves those who
serve themselves.

01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:56.470
Poor Olivia!

01:15:57.150 --> 01:15:59.980
She had learned something
about life and love.

01:16:01.050 --> 01:16:02.640
But more importantly...

01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:06.940
She had learned the secret access code
to Bob client's acconts...

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.400
People who trusted Bob...

01:16:09.570 --> 01:16:11.630
Beyond the shadow of a doubt.

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.390
How much shall I transfer,
20,000 dollars?

01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:30.350
More!

01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:32.180
40,000?

01:16:33.730 --> 01:16:34.830
More!

01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:37.080
100,000?

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.340
Okay!

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.020
Let's take out...

01:16:42.090 --> 01:16:44.810
200,000 dollars!

01:16:46.190 --> 01:16:52.710
And transfer that to Robert
Patchett, Banque Suisse...

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:56.470
Zurich, Switzerland.

01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:03.340
It's not exactly
like we were framing Bob...

01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:08.040
We were just making his thievery
a little more obvious...

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:12.190
You know, sometimes you just
have to exaggerate things...

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:14.550
In order to make
people see the truth!

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.000
Dreadful, embarrassing...

01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:48.620
Terrible, horriyfingly bad, bad, bad.

01:17:48.650 --> 01:17:51.130
Even those words
don't adequately describe...

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:52.660
Mary Fisher's new novel.

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:55.250
This book simply chokes
the reader's brain...

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.390
Before he has
even finished chapter one.

01:17:57.790 --> 01:17:59.420
Clearly this novel
is but a waist...

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:02.450
Of time, paper, ink
and shelf space.

01:18:02.730 --> 01:18:04.180
This reviewer
wouldn't shed a tear...

01:18:04.210 --> 01:18:06.600
To find his copy of
"Love In The Rinse Cycle"...

01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:09.090
Lost in the garbage disposal.

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:12.120
I hate to say
"I told you so..."

01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:13.270
But...

01:18:13.330 --> 01:18:14.940
You just did, didn't you?

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.330
Hello!

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.030
Bills, bills, bills!

01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:41.970
Oh, here's a little something
that should cheer you up!

01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:44.110
Like a fan letter!

01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:47.110
You know what I'm thinking?

01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:50.530
I think we should go on a
little vacation, just you and me.

01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:53.050
Have some fun,
go to the islands...

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:53.950
I don't know...

01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:56.650
Have some Coco Loco
some Piñas Coladas...

01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:59.890
Just relax, recharge your batteries...
God, I 'd love that!

01:19:00.170 --> 01:19:02.660
- What do you think, Mary?
- You bastard!

01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:04.690
Mary!

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:05.910
Mary!

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:09.180
Mary... come back here!

01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:10.440
Please!

01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:14.250
You know you're the only woman
I've ever been faithful to?

01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:22.550
Ute, where are you going?

01:19:22.570 --> 01:19:25.180
I took this job because I only
had to cook and clean...

01:19:25.210 --> 01:19:26.590
For one person
and one dog!

01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:29.180
Then I get the
mother, the lover...

01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:31.150
His kids, their dog!

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:32.290
Miss Fisher!

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.720
Up with this bullshit
I will not put!

01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:35.850
I quit!

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:40.040
Oh no, no, no, no, no!

01:20:03.490 --> 01:20:04.750
Stop that!

01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:07.060
Stop it!

01:20:07.810 --> 01:20:09.240
Stop it, now!

01:20:10.150 --> 01:20:12.170
Take your filthy hands
off her, Garcia!

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.170
You're fired!

01:20:13.190 --> 01:20:15.460
Get out!
Out of my house!

01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:17.350
I hate you!

01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:20.470
You go upstairs, young lady
and take off my dress!

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:21.800
You're not my mother!

01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:24.080
I said move!

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.640
And you, young man...

01:20:27.130 --> 01:20:28.840
Mother, go sit down!

01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:32.200
To your room!
And stay there!

01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:33.580
You're grounded!

01:20:33.610 --> 01:20:34.770
What's going on here?

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:35.730
Bob!

01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:41.230
I'm taking back
control of my life, Bob!

01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:43.220
As long as you're all
under my roof...

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:44.940
Things will be done my way...

01:20:45.130 --> 01:20:47.010
Starting now!

01:20:54.690 --> 01:20:57.790
Mary Fisher had decided
to lay down the law!

01:20:59.590 --> 01:21:01.460
That's not a bad idea!

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:06.860
Yes, I'd like the number for the
Internal Revenue Service, please.

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:08.610
Thank you.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.670
But I think some matters
ought to be handled...

01:21:11.690 --> 01:21:13.470
By the proper authorities.

01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:42.990
- Mark.
- Mary!

01:21:43.210 --> 01:21:45.080
- Great party!
- Thank you!

01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:48.750
- I knew you would come!
- Glad to see you!

01:21:49.730 --> 01:21:50.700
Mary!

01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:52.440
You look wonderful!

01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:53.140
Thank you!

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:54.150
Mary...

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:56.780
I'm glad to see you.

01:21:57.330 --> 01:21:59.810
What a success, my dear,
everybody is having fun!

01:22:00.150 --> 01:22:02.300
I just want you to know that
as far as I am concerned...

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:03.870
You are still on probation.

01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:05.490
So, you should be nice...

01:22:05.770 --> 01:22:06.890
To my friends!

01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:12.520
- Hey!
- Why, see there!

01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:14.160
- Can I bring you a fresh one?
- No thanks!

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:16.830
I'm enjoying your party,
Your Highness!

01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:18.190
Going well!

01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:37.770
Attention, everybody!

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.150
Everybody, quiet down!

01:22:42.450 --> 01:22:44.090
I would like
to propose a toast...

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.680
To the wonderful woman...

01:22:45.710 --> 01:22:48.170
Who put this fabulous
party together...

01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:50.660
She doesn't know how
much I appreciate her...

01:22:50.690 --> 01:22:52.410
And that's probably my fault...

01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:54.850
Because I don't tell her
often enough.

01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:57.310
And so I'm going
to tell her right now!

01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:59.200
In front of all of you
good people.

01:23:00.170 --> 01:23:01.690
Mary, come on up here!

01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:03.120
- Come on!
- Music guys!

01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:05.940
Come on everybody,
give her a big hand!

01:23:09.090 --> 01:23:10.160
Mary...

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.440
You are the abosolute best!

01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:15.370
And I'm the luckiest guy
this room!

01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:17.520
It's a great life...

01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:19.650
And things are only
going to get better.

01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:22.100
Toast to you, honey!

01:23:26.970 --> 01:23:29.380
Robert Patchett,
I have warrant for your arrest!

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:30.840
For what?

01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:32.890
For fraud and embezzlement.

01:23:33.090 --> 01:23:34.050
I can't imagine!

01:23:34.270 --> 01:23:36.270
But this is a private party!

01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:38.690
You can't just come...
You have to leave!

01:23:38.770 --> 01:23:40.300
There must be some mistake!

01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:42.760
There's no mistake, Mr. Patchett.
Will you please come with me?

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.360
Sorry to spoil your party!

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:51.480
Bye-bye, Bobby!

01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:56.980
Call Larry!

01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:01.320
Watch your head, sir.

01:24:03.710 --> 01:24:05.910
Be brave, darling!

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.030
This would make
a bestseller.

01:24:25.290 --> 01:24:26.860
How serious is it, Larry?

01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:29.670
26 counts of fraud
and embezzlement...

01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:32.790
We are looking at 200,000
to 300,000 dollars in fines...

01:24:32.810 --> 01:24:34.450
That's a lot of money!

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.730
- I think we can handle it.
- Plus...

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:39.740
Two to five years in prison.

01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:41.880
That's crazy, Larry!

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.500
You got to do something!

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:44.440
Mary!

01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:45.320
Bob!

01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:48.980
The solution to your problem
lies in two words...

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:53.110
Pay off?

01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:54.350
No, Bob!

01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:56.270
Judge Phillips!

01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:59.540
Judge Phillips?

01:24:59.690 --> 01:25:01.730
I have learned that Judge Phillips
will be hearing your case...

01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:03.850
And that is
very good news!

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:07.350
For not only is he my father's
old golf partner...

01:25:07.730 --> 01:25:09.770
Judge Phillips tends to be very...

01:25:10.450 --> 01:25:13.200
Considerate towards
white-collar criminals.

01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:15.430
Criminals?
Who's talking about criminals?

01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:16.880
Larry, I'm no criminal!

01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:18.330
Of course you're not, Bob!

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:19.470
Just relax, Bob!

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:21.000
We know that...

01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:24.070
A considerable amount
of your client's money was...

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:26.120
Somehow transferred into your...

01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:27.820
Personal bank account
in Switzerland.

01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:30.010
- Yes!
- Our defense will claim...

01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:33.670
That a virus somehow
crept into your computer...

01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:36.330
Causing a mistaken transfer
of money.

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:39.610
The idea is to chalk the all thing up
to a software glitch!

01:25:39.850 --> 01:25:40.810
I love it!

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:44.470
Plus, to ram home the idea
that the whole thing was an accident...

01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:46.780
We can show that the largest
transfer of money...

01:25:46.810 --> 01:25:47.930
Came from Mary's
own account...

01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:50.340
We all know that
was a mistake, right?

01:25:50.710 --> 01:25:52.050
Absolutely!

01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:53.740
Don't worry about a thing!

01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:55.710
Then I'm going to play two
rounds with the judge...

01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:57.560
So we can all start doing
the ground work.

01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:00.090
Are you sure this'll work,
this computer virus affair?

01:26:00.110 --> 01:26:03.850
Bob, I don't get paid 350 dollars
an hour to give bad advice!

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:06.000
Okay!

01:26:24.130 --> 01:26:25.760
Mary, you've been great!

01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:28.240
How the hell did
a bum like me...

01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:30.530
End up with a wonderful
woman like you?

01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:32.950
Don't you dare touch me!

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.380
You think
I was born yesterday?

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:36.260
Hey, hey!
What is the matter?

01:26:45.790 --> 01:26:48.190
It's bad enough to steal
from your own clients...

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:50.950
But to steal from the
very hand that feeds you!

01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:54.400
You heard what Larry said,
it was the computer.

01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:57.500
Computers don't have
Swiss bank accounts, Bob!

01:26:59.730 --> 01:27:00.420
Mary!

01:27:00.450 --> 01:27:01.910
I'm glad this has happened!

01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:03.670
Because now I can
see the real you...

01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:05.590
You greedy son of a bitch!

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:07.950
I want you out of my life!

01:27:11.290 --> 01:27:13.830
Oh, and... you're fired!

01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:24.000
Patchett... Patchett..Patchett.

01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:27.510
It's judge Phillips.

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:29.850
I sure can!

01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:32.030
Oh, it's no problem!

01:27:32.130 --> 01:27:33.850
For you, anything!

01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:36.450
Yes!

01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:38.490
The job is working out
very well!

01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:40.750
It's just wonderful!

01:27:41.290 --> 01:27:43.040
I can't begin to thank you!

01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:46.030
Oh. I'm so glad
to hear that, dear!

01:27:46.930 --> 01:27:47.920
Goodbye!

01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:58.500
This judge is a very expensive guy,
look he loves to...

01:27:58.530 --> 01:28:00.310
Let me ask you, is there
a conflict of interest...

01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:01.460
I'm asking you
as a lawyer...

01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:03.540
Can we take him out
to dinner after, go to Ruban D'Or?

01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:05.650
Well, better be Peter Luger.

01:28:05.670 --> 01:28:07.360
Fine!
I'm buying...

01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:09.010
Absolutely brilliant!

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.440
All rise!

01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:11.720
How do I look?

01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:12.900
You look great!
How do you feel?

01:28:12.930 --> 01:28:13.990
Fine!

01:28:19.890 --> 01:28:21.210
Please be seated.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.960
Case number 64-84,
People vs. Patchett.

01:28:26.630 --> 01:28:29.110
Honorable Judge Brown presides.

01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:34.920
It is true that the defendant
has no criminal record...

01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:38.600
And is a well respected member
of the community...

01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:43.010
But the fact remains
that the defendant stole...

01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:46.050
Large sums of money
from his clients.

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:49.200
In doing so
Mr. Patchett has...

01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:52.160
Not only broken
a sacred trust...

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:54.940
He has shaken the public's faith...

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:57.050
In accountants, everywhere.

01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:00.650
This Court therefore will fine
Robert Patchett...

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:03.230
250,000 dollars...

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:06.400
And orders him to serve
a prison term of...

01:29:06.570 --> 01:29:07.970
18 months.

01:29:10.650 --> 01:29:12.540
She's... she's kidding, right?

01:29:12.850 --> 01:29:14.420
You promised me
all would be okay!

01:29:14.450 --> 01:29:17.080
I'm really sorry, Bob.
If we had Judge Phillips...

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:17.790
No problem!

01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:19.360
Hey, why don't you
hear to have judge...

01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:21.050
And all us together for
a round of golf...

01:29:21.070 --> 01:29:23.190
I'll be free in, say, 18 months!

01:29:23.210 --> 01:29:23.960
Come on!

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:25.110
Come on!

01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:27.610
Easy!

01:29:27.730 --> 01:29:28.830
- Easy!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:31.200
Ruth!
Ruth! Is that you?

01:29:31.230 --> 01:29:32.060
Ruth!

01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:33.740
It's my wife!

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:35.630
Ruth!
Where have you been?

01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:38.030
- All right, come on, let's go!
- You got to help me!

01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:39.550
That's Ruth!

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.230
Ruth!

01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:42.010
Help me!

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.630
Poor Bob!

01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:48.860
I almost felt sorry for him!

01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:51.400
Almost!

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:13.330
Mary Fisher no longer
wants her palace by the sea.

01:30:14.850 --> 01:30:17.150
She doesn't love
my husband anymore either...

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.370
And these days...

01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:24.540
Bob is growing accustomed
to a very different lifestyle.

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:31.650
Hey, what's burning?

01:30:33.810 --> 01:30:35.160
My lasagna!

01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:40.800
Oh, shit!

01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:43.300
What the hell are you doing
now, Patchett?

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:45.840
I don't understand.
I've only had it in for 20 minutes!

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:49.220
You jerk!

01:30:49.330 --> 01:30:52.060
You put it in at 5,25 minutes
when it's supposed to be at 3,50.

01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:54.580
Hey, I'm really sorry!

01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:56.910
You Patchett, you go a visitor!

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.240
Get out of here!

01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:08.050
Hey, daddy!

01:31:09.070 --> 01:31:10.170
It's daddy!

01:31:11.130 --> 01:31:13.030
Nicolette, Andy, come here!

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:16.300
I've missed you!

01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:18.500
I've missed you both!

01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:19.570
How are you doing?

01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:21.020
I count the days!

01:31:27.150 --> 01:31:28.130
Hello, Ruth!

01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:29.310
Hello, Bob!

01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:31.980
Thanks for bringing the kids.
How are you doing?

01:31:32.010 --> 01:31:33.140
You look great!

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:35.090
Thanks, you look good too.

01:31:35.670 --> 01:31:37.120
I'm all right, I guess!

01:31:37.530 --> 01:31:39.450
I got a lot of time
on my hands.

01:31:41.190 --> 01:31:44.240
Look, I realize you and the kids
have to have a lot to talk about...

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:45.880
So I'll leave you alone.

01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:49.300
So long, Ruth, thanks again!

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:50.540
Sure, Bob!

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:54.610
Hey, Ruth!

01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:58.850
I get out
in a couple of months.

01:31:59.870 --> 01:32:01.940
Maybe I can come visit,
cook you all dinner!

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:04.650
That'd be nice.

01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:09.630
Hey!

01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:12.390
Here you got,
I made you some cookies.

01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:13.550
Give them a try!

01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:15.900
Be honest, tell me exactly
what you think.

01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:19.640
- They're good, Dad!
- Are you serious?

01:32:19.730 --> 01:32:21.250
- Yes...
- Do you mean it?

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:22.890
I was worried,
I thought you may not like them!

01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:24.580
People can change.

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:27.010
That's why
you can't give up on them.

01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:29.660
Even Mary Fisher.

01:32:32.210 --> 01:32:34.840
We are here with...
Mary Fisher.

01:32:35.290 --> 01:32:37.500
And she is the former
romance novelist.

01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:39.490
Now, Mary has just
written a new book...

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:42.370
And this is something
that is very different.

01:32:42.850 --> 01:32:45.480
It's called:
'Trust and Betrayal'

01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:46.800
And it's subtitled...

01:32:46.830 --> 01:32:50.870
A docunovel of love,
money and skepticism.

01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:53.720
Thank you very much
for joining us this morning!

01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:56.050
Thank you, Sally.
It's very nice to be here.

01:32:56.770 --> 01:32:58.660
Now, let's see,
this was about...

01:32:58.690 --> 01:33:00.140
A year and a half ago...

01:33:00.170 --> 01:33:02.380
That your last novel
was published...

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:05.310
- And it was...
- A complete and utter flop!

01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:08.170
Yes!

01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:10.580
We may as well be blunt!

01:33:11.170 --> 01:33:12.730
But the new book
has gotten...

01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:14.520
Fabulous reviews...

01:33:14.690 --> 01:33:15.740
Yes, it's has, yes.

01:33:15.770 --> 01:33:17.120
Anf from the serious...

01:33:17.370 --> 01:33:18.170
Critics.

01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:20.440
And this is a real
departure for you...

01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:21.450
From anything that
you ever...

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:23.410
Yes, people can change.

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:27.230
Of course you
can't expect miracles!

01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:30.110
- Thank you, Miss. Fisher.
- A pleasure.

01:33:32.630 --> 01:33:34.970
Could you make it out
to Douglas?

01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:36.290
To Douglas...

01:33:37.090 --> 01:33:38.280
With thanks...

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:40.630
Mary Fisher.

01:33:44.670 --> 01:33:46.310
How shall I inscribe it?

01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:47.340
Would you sign it...

01:33:47.470 --> 01:33:48.440
To Ruth?

01:33:49.050 --> 01:33:50.680
To Ruth...

01:33:51.010 --> 01:33:52.410
With thanks...

01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:53.760
Mary...

01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:55.450
Fisher.

01:33:58.640 --> 01:33:59.820
Thank you!

01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:09.190
Could you inscribe it
to Alain, please?

01:34:09.730 --> 01:34:10.840
Bien sur!

01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:15.020
Your grasp of the
post-modern metaphors...

01:34:15.050 --> 01:34:16.740
Is wonderful, Mrs. Fisher...

01:34:17.530 --> 01:34:18.810
Oh, no, no, no...

01:34:19.410 --> 01:34:20.810
Miss. Fisher!

01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:22.820
Please...

01:34:23.150 --> 01:34:25.450
Call me... Mary.
