WEBVTT

00:04.337 --> 00:05.998
What are you doing here?

00:06.540 --> 00:08.098
Having lunch.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.973
Don't you care that there could be
Priors out there

00:11.078 --> 00:13.512
taking advantage
of poor, innocent people?

00:14.147 --> 00:17.947
Luring them into an oppressive religion,
or worse, killing them for rejecting it?

00:18.051 --> 00:19.609
Are you bored of bothering Jackson?

00:19.720 --> 00:22.746
Hey, you're supposed to be going out
on missions through the stargate.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.654
So let's go.
Let's rid the galaxy of evildoers.

00:26.159 --> 00:29.720
Look, despite what Daniel might think,
I really can help.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.458
I know how things work out there,
I'm physically capable.

00:32.566 --> 00:35.899
I'm good with weapons,
not to mention seductively attractive.

00:36.403 --> 00:37.597
(CHUCKLES)

00:38.805 --> 00:40.773
I'd make a fine asset to any SG team.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.206
You left out selfish and untrustworthy.

00:43.577 --> 00:47.274
How about independent and resourceful?

00:47.380 --> 00:49.177
That is a classified file.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.487
Priors have been reported
on 43 different planets already.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.385
Yeah, that's what the file says.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.287
Well, it just so happens
that I have a very good relationship

00:58.391 --> 01:01.326
with the people on the one
you've designated P8X-412.

01:02.162 --> 01:04.790
Define "relationship."

01:04.898 --> 01:06.388
They trust me.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.362
-What? Where are you going?
-I'm gonna talk to Landry.

01:10.470 --> 01:11.596
Why?

01:12.105 --> 01:17.065
Because anyone who trusts you
is obviously in a great deal of danger.

01:38.331 --> 01:40.265
Oh, good. No one's here.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.497
I thought these people trusted you.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.968
Why are we sneaking around
avoiding everybody?

01:45.071 --> 01:47.403
I already told you.
They won't recognize me dressed like this.

01:47.507 --> 01:49.475
Fortunately, I left a couple
of spare outfits behind.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.134
What is with her and her wardrobe?

01:51.244 --> 01:53.075
You know, I think we could probably
explain to them exactly...

01:53.180 --> 01:54.169
It will only take a second.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.841
-Can a girl have a little privacy?
-No.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.817
Besides, I think that I've seen
just about everything there is to see.

01:59.920 --> 02:03.287
Right. Look, there's no other way
out of this room.

02:03.390 --> 02:06.655
I'm just going to change. I'll be right back.

02:11.565 --> 02:12.623
Hey.

02:25.111 --> 02:27.079
These are the weapons
of our god, Quetesh.

02:27.180 --> 02:28.977
-Who are you?
-Just take it easy.

02:29.082 --> 02:31.550
-What are you doing here?
-We mean no harm.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.018
Please forgive us.

02:42.128 --> 02:45.359
It has been so long,
we began to fear you would not return.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.534
Then you are foolish.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.636
I would not abandon you.

02:51.238 --> 02:53.069
I am your god.

04:06.646 --> 04:09.274
I have pillaged the galaxy many times over

04:09.382 --> 04:11.816
and made slaves of all the mortals
I have encountered.

04:11.918 --> 04:15.410
This world pleases me
and I shall take it as my own.

04:15.522 --> 04:18.514
The benevolent god, Quetesh,
will never allow such treachery.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.594
-Not exactly Shakespeare.
-ACTOR: Foolish slave, I am Ba'al.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.890
How is it these people don't know
the Goa'uld have fallen?

04:23.997 --> 04:26.966
Most of these worlds are pretty isolated
and I would be very surprised

04:27.067 --> 04:29.399
if anyone here actually knew
how to operate the gate.

04:29.502 --> 04:32.062
-These humans must be told the truth.
-I know.

04:33.206 --> 04:37.267
Oh, merciful, beautiful Quetesh,
have mercy on him.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.140
He knows not your power.

04:39.312 --> 04:41.473
-What are you doing?
-It's a play.

04:41.581 --> 04:44.209
Don't worry, I think it will be over soon,
then we'll eat.

04:44.317 --> 04:46.376
That's not what I'm talking about.

04:46.486 --> 04:49.011
We want to stop these people
from falling victim to the Priors.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.250
-That's what I'm going to do.
-This is not what I had in mind.

04:52.359 --> 04:56.227
What your mind may or may not be able
to imagine is really none of my concern.

04:56.329 --> 04:58.092
Now kindly get out of your god's face.

04:58.198 --> 04:59.961
ACTOR:...you have never met
the likes of Quetesh.

05:00.066 --> 05:03.365
ACTRESS: No man shall lay claim
to my world

05:04.371 --> 05:08.899
and no man shall bring harm
to my children.

05:15.281 --> 05:17.340
ACTOR: Thanks be to you, Quetesh.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.346
All hail and glory be to you.

05:32.332 --> 05:36.268
We had little rehearsal, my lord,
but I trust it pleases you?

05:36.903 --> 05:37.927
Yes.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.939
As always, Azdak,
you please your god greatly.

05:42.042 --> 05:45.170
Thank you, my lord.
You have been greatly missed.

05:46.713 --> 05:50.205
Now, I would like to hear about the visitor

05:50.316 --> 05:52.716
who arrived through the Chappa'ai.

05:54.888 --> 05:59.450
It is pointless lying to your god, Azdak.
I'm all-knowing as well as all-beautiful.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.790
He said that he was here to save us,

06:03.263 --> 06:06.255
that our true gods await our devotion.

06:06.766 --> 06:09.701
Lies meant to deceive you.

06:10.103 --> 06:13.504
I did not believe a word he said, my lord.
I swear it.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.264
Some of you did.

06:15.975 --> 06:18.671
You have been absent
for so many seasons.

06:19.245 --> 06:21.907
Some thought maybe
you had abandoned us.

06:22.082 --> 06:26.018
They were weak, my lord.
Please forgive them.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.913
Have I not always been merciful
to those who deserve forgiveness?

06:31.758 --> 06:35.057
Now go, while I consider your punishment.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.757
Yes. Of course.

06:49.109 --> 06:52.408
Well, that was easy.

06:52.645 --> 06:54.510
Shut that thing off.

06:56.749 --> 06:59.217
Why must you continue
to deceive these people?

06:59.319 --> 07:03.119
This was one of many planets that
Quetesh ruled over when I was her host.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.248
As you know a Tok'ra eventually
removed the symbiote,

07:05.358 --> 07:07.690
but not before her people
rebelled and tortured me,

07:07.794 --> 07:09.591
thinking we were one and the same.

07:09.696 --> 07:12.426
And they couldn't tell the difference?

07:13.233 --> 07:15.098
Why am I not surprised?

07:15.969 --> 07:17.197
I had nothing.

07:18.304 --> 07:19.566
I was desolate.

07:20.473 --> 07:23.374
Fortunately, I discovered that news
of Quetesh's demise

07:23.476 --> 07:25.637
had not reached this little mining outpost.

07:25.745 --> 07:28.111
So you kept them mining naquadah
for you?

07:28.214 --> 07:29.875
Just a tiny bit.

07:30.350 --> 07:32.784
The mine was practically barren
by the time I got here,

07:32.886 --> 07:36.913
but this planet acted as a safe haven
for me until I got back on my feet.

07:38.124 --> 07:41.992
Look, I never killed anyone,
I never tortured them.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.290
I was a wonderful god. Just ask them.

07:44.397 --> 07:47.423
-I think we will.
-Why? You don't believe me?

07:47.534 --> 07:50.367
That, and I'm not totally convinced they're
ultimately gonna follow your command,

07:50.470 --> 07:52.700
nor should that be the only reason
they don't follow the Priors.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.103
I am still supposed to be their god.
I can't exactly go out there

07:55.208 --> 07:56.505
and ask them if they're going
to listen to me.

07:56.609 --> 07:57.633
I wasn't expecting you to.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.712
What makes you think
they're gonna tell you the truth?

07:59.812 --> 08:01.006
You're supposed to be
my faithful servants.

08:01.114 --> 08:04.106
Then I'll sort of explain to them we're not
as faithful as you might like to believe

08:04.217 --> 08:06.549
and, if necessary, I'll also tell them
that we're plotting to kill you.

08:07.954 --> 08:09.945
I have heard better plans.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.015
-I kind of like it.
-Shut up.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.855
How are the staff evaluations coming?

08:19.966 --> 08:22.400
They're done. They'll be on your desk
by tomorrow morning.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.062
-That's when they're due, right?
-Yes.

08:25.738 --> 08:30.141
Now, I have lunch with the heads
of my departments once a month

08:30.243 --> 08:33.269
just to stay in touch,
get any housekeeping done.

08:33.379 --> 08:36.246
Helps me get to know them a lot better.
I know in our case...

08:36.349 --> 08:37.338
What?

08:38.685 --> 08:39.947
In our case, what?

08:40.053 --> 08:42.078
Well, it's just that we know each other
a little better

08:42.188 --> 08:45.715
than, say, I do Colonel Garrett,
the munitions supply officer.

08:45.825 --> 08:47.258
Really? I actually doubt that.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.386
Colonel Garrett's been here longer
than I have.

08:51.297 --> 08:53.322
Do we have to do this here?

08:53.433 --> 08:56.960
You want to have lunch, fine.
Tomorrow noon, I will be there as ordered.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.334
-It's not an order.
-Okay.

09:08.014 --> 09:10.778
I have been sick for some time now.

09:11.417 --> 09:15.444
The past few harvests, I've been more
of a burden than a help to my family.

09:15.788 --> 09:18.279
I had even lost the ability to stand.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.086
JACKSON: You're standing now.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.593
The Prior, he cured me.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.858
-Said that it was the will of the Ori.
-Blasphemer!

09:27.700 --> 09:30.100
Just take it easy.

09:30.203 --> 09:33.434
I'm sorry, but I will not have him speak
against Quetesh like that in my presence.

09:33.539 --> 09:37.600
Look, we're not out to get anybody here.
We just want to hear what he has to say.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.540
Go ahead.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.481
The jewel in his staff, it glowed.

09:44.751 --> 09:48.243
He waved it over me,
and I felt better than I ever have.

09:48.655 --> 09:51.988
All he asked in return
was that I tell others,

09:52.659 --> 09:54.752
that I spread the word of the Ori.

09:55.128 --> 09:58.757
-Then, upon his return...
-When is this Prior to return?

10:00.500 --> 10:01.728
Tomorrow.

10:03.536 --> 10:06.369
The Prior said that Quetesh is a false god.

10:06.472 --> 10:09.873
That if she ever returned,
he would expose her weakness.

10:09.976 --> 10:11.034
You're a fool!

10:11.144 --> 10:14.238
Speak no more, or I shall strike you down
in the name of our true god.

10:14.347 --> 10:17.214
I said, take it easy.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.751
You should be thankful
that Quetesh is so forgiving

10:19.852 --> 10:22.650
and pray when she slays the Prior
for his wicked lies

10:22.755 --> 10:25.121
-she won't do the same to you.
-Oh, boy.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.388
Glory be to Quetesh!

10:27.593 --> 10:32.292
-Glory to the one true god...
-Okay, you have made your point.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.161
Know when to stop.

10:35.868 --> 10:38.666
I think I need to talk to our one true god.

10:39.906 --> 10:42.397
This is why you wanted
to come back to this planet?

10:42.508 --> 10:44.169
All of this is mine.

10:45.211 --> 10:46.473
I earned it.

10:46.579 --> 10:48.342
These people have just been
keeping it safe for me.

10:48.448 --> 10:51.975
And as you said, we can't be 100%
certain that they're going to obey me.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.950
So if this planet does fall to the Priors...

10:54.053 --> 10:57.614
Hello, you stealing
this planet's most valued treasure

10:57.724 --> 11:00.386
is the least of our concerns right now.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.960
I like your attitude.

11:02.061 --> 11:05.724
I was thinking of cutting you boys
in at 10%. And now I'm thinking 20.

11:05.832 --> 11:09.928
Despite your return, many of the villagers
believe the Ori to be true gods

11:10.036 --> 11:11.435
and worthy of their loyalty.

11:11.537 --> 11:15.405
All the more reason why we should pack
all of this up right now and get out of here.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.805
Are you gonna pitch in or what?

11:16.909 --> 11:19.469
Others believe you will slay the Prior
in a show of power

11:19.579 --> 11:21.911
-upon his return tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

11:23.182 --> 11:26.151
-Tomorrow's no good for me.
-You need to tell these people the truth.

11:26.252 --> 11:29.346
I have a lot of needs, Daniel, but
I assure you that that is not one of them.

11:29.455 --> 11:32.185
If you do not tell them the truth, we will.

11:32.291 --> 11:35.158
Yes, and who do you think
they're actually going to believe?

11:35.261 --> 11:38.560
Look, commanding these people to obey
you and not the Ori is not gonna work.

11:38.664 --> 11:39.892
Especially once that Prior comes back.

11:39.999 --> 11:43.127
And we do not want to get into a god-off.

11:43.403 --> 11:46.429
Especially since we know
you're not even close.

11:46.906 --> 11:48.806
Forget what I said about the 20%.

11:48.908 --> 11:51.502
He's right.
We can't trade one lie for another lie.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.442
All right. What can we fight with, then?

11:53.546 --> 11:55.707
How can we stop this Prior
from corrupting these people?

11:55.815 --> 11:57.942
Okay, we have a very limited window
of opportunity here.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.779
If you expose yourself as a false god,

11:59.886 --> 12:02.116
if you tell these people
how you fooled them and why,

12:02.221 --> 12:03.984
we might be able to make them
skeptical about the Prior.

12:04.090 --> 12:07.526
Or it could push them towards believing
in the Ori as true gods even more.

12:07.627 --> 12:08.753
No, the only chance these people have,

12:08.861 --> 12:10.351
the only chance any of us
have against the Priors

12:10.463 --> 12:12.328
is to show them
we will not accept the Ori as gods.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.831
No matter what happens
we must reject them,

12:13.933 --> 12:16.026
true enlightenment
must begin with the truth.

12:16.135 --> 12:18.729
Oh, please. The truth is so overrated.

12:18.838 --> 12:21.306
Look, for once,
just do the right thing here, okay?

12:21.407 --> 12:24.001
You're gonna feel
so good about it afterwards.

12:25.044 --> 12:26.011
Trust me.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.074
Really, this is unnecessary.

12:31.184 --> 12:34.915
You will be executed
first light tomorrow, impostor.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.062
So, Daniel,

12:45.631 --> 12:48.156
when does that warm and glowy feeling
from doing the right thing kick in?

12:48.267 --> 12:50.360
'Cause, not there yet.

12:57.410 --> 13:00.811
I can't believe you all just stood there
and let them imprison me.

13:00.913 --> 13:03.143
-What were we supposed to do?
-You have guns, don't you?

13:03.249 --> 13:05.843
-There was, like, over 100 people there!
-And?

13:06.085 --> 13:08.576
Just relax, we're gonna get you out of this.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.153
Oh, you are?

13:11.557 --> 13:14.117
I feel a lot better.
I'm sorry, I got a little nervous

13:14.227 --> 13:15.751
what with the whole execution
looming and all!

13:15.862 --> 13:17.762
Just believe me.
It is not gonna come to that.

13:17.864 --> 13:20.697
Mitchell and Teal'c
are talking to them right now.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.963
Have you forgotten that if I die, you die?

13:25.304 --> 13:29.104
Believe me, it is not gonna come to that.
Trust me.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.436
(GASPS)

13:32.979 --> 13:34.276
This time.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.948
Fine. She made a mistake.
It was a big mistake.

13:38.050 --> 13:41.042
It was a whopper,
but you can't just kill her.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.715
Why not?

13:45.091 --> 13:46.456
Little help?

13:46.626 --> 13:50.824
Does she not deserve a trial
to explain the things that she has done?

13:51.130 --> 13:54.657
I think we all have a pretty good idea
of what she did and why.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.934
Your people are looking for leadership.

13:58.037 --> 13:59.902
They're looking to you.

14:00.973 --> 14:02.565
So you've gotta decide.

14:03.609 --> 14:05.941
What kind of society you wanna have?

14:06.045 --> 14:09.947
One where people get executed
without a chance to explain their actions?

14:11.083 --> 14:13.142
You wanna hold a Mal Doran?

14:14.620 --> 14:16.349
Isn't that her name?

14:17.790 --> 14:20.418
Quetesh established the process
several years ago.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.427
A way to settle disputes
between two parties.

14:24.730 --> 14:26.823
Fine. That sounds fitting.

14:28.167 --> 14:30.328
We're gonna hold a Mal Doran!

14:38.945 --> 14:42.813
-Hey, how'd it go?
-Well, you know...

14:44.684 --> 14:47.881
What's the plan?
You gonna blow up this door?

14:47.987 --> 14:50.478
Lay down suppression fire
so that we can rush out

14:50.590 --> 14:52.922
through the hidden escape passage?

14:53.025 --> 14:55.960
It's in the room I told you
had no other exit.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.758
They're gonna put you on trial tomorrow.

15:00.199 --> 15:02.929
-I like my plan better.
-lt kind of is your plan.

15:03.035 --> 15:04.935
-It's named after you.
-Really?

15:05.037 --> 15:07.904
A Mal Doran.
They gonna let me be the judge?

15:09.075 --> 15:11.600
-Don't think so.
-Then it's not a real Mal Doran, is it?

15:11.711 --> 15:13.235
Actually, this couldn't have
worked out better.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.576
-Actually, I think it could have.
-No, a trial is public.

15:15.681 --> 15:18.514
We can use the forum to expose
what it is to be a false god and warn

15:18.618 --> 15:20.950
-the community about the Priors.
-VALA: You're right, actually.

15:21.053 --> 15:23.044
We could get them all worked up
about false gods

15:23.155 --> 15:25.282
and then they can kill me as an example
to the others.

15:25.391 --> 15:28.360
Look, I persuaded them to let you stay
here for the night.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.326
-Right, thanks.
-Yeah.

15:31.497 --> 15:33.431
Well, I'll see you guys in the morning.

15:33.532 --> 15:37.992
Thank you. I apologize for ever doubting
your masterful skills at negotiation.

15:38.104 --> 15:41.130
-He's doing the best he can.
-That's what terrifies me.

15:46.679 --> 15:51.343
Welcome, and thank you all for coming.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.311
Unlike in the past,

15:56.222 --> 15:58.383
the final decision of this Mal Doran

15:58.991 --> 16:02.791
will be yours, my friends. A general vote.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.657
After both presentations have been made,

16:05.765 --> 16:10.532
we shall all decide what is to be done
to the false god Quetesh.

16:15.174 --> 16:18.041
-We're pleading innocent, right?
-You already confessed.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.805
A girl can change her mind, can't she?

16:19.912 --> 16:23.507
We shall begin, as always,
with the reading of the claims.

16:24.884 --> 16:28.411
The first claim of seven, mass murder.

16:29.588 --> 16:33.149
-Wait a second.
-The second claim of seven, mass torture.

16:33.459 --> 16:36.326
I never killed. I never tortured.
That is Quetesh.

16:36.429 --> 16:40.160
-The third claim of seven...
-Excuse me. Hi, sorry to interrupt.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.865
The person seated before you
didn't do those things.

16:44.970 --> 16:47.837
You will have your chance
to make your presentation.

16:47.940 --> 16:51.432
Yes, I'm sure we will. I just wanted
to make something very clear.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.910
As we discussed when she confessed,

16:54.380 --> 16:56.974
Vala was a host to a Goa'uld,

16:57.516 --> 17:00.952
a parasite that controlled her actions
for many years.

17:01.253 --> 17:03.983
It was that Goa'uld symbiote,
named Quetesh,

17:04.090 --> 17:06.058
that committed the atrocities
you're talking about.

17:06.158 --> 17:09.787
Vala herself can only be held responsible
for the actions she did

17:10.296 --> 17:12.560
after that Goa'uld was removed.

17:13.132 --> 17:14.963
When exactly was that?

17:18.871 --> 17:20.202
Four years?

17:31.951 --> 17:33.248
Very well.

17:33.986 --> 17:36.454
Assuming your assertion to be true.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.453
We shall begin again.

17:42.361 --> 17:44.022
The first claim of four,

17:44.964 --> 17:47.728
planetary-wide forced labor.

17:51.137 --> 17:53.128
It's gonna be a long day.

17:54.507 --> 17:55.735
Indeed.

17:58.210 --> 18:01.236
I, perhaps more than any of you,

18:03.115 --> 18:04.446
feel great sorrow

18:04.984 --> 18:08.385
at the fact that I devoted my love and faith

18:09.255 --> 18:11.689
so freely to an impostor

18:13.025 --> 18:16.629
who cared only for the naquadah
in our mines.

18:17.863 --> 18:20.263
With every breath, she lied.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.266
With every effort, she stole.

18:25.337 --> 18:28.363
At every chance, she betrayed us.

18:29.341 --> 18:32.367
The conditions of poverty
that we now suffer

18:33.145 --> 18:35.739
are her fault and her fault alone.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.813
That is what you must consider!

18:41.387 --> 18:42.547
(PEOPLE MURMURING)

18:42.655 --> 18:44.816
-He's good.
-I'm dead.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.865
Yes, she stole.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.563
She betrayed you.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.835
She used you as slave labor.

19:05.444 --> 19:07.036
All this is true.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.713
Not the opening statement
I would have gone for.

19:10.816 --> 19:14.809
But the only reason you know about this
is because she told you.

19:18.057 --> 19:21.322
She came forward knowing full well
how you would feel

19:21.427 --> 19:23.190
and what the consequences would be.

19:23.295 --> 19:25.855
Ask yourselves, why did she do this?

19:27.499 --> 19:30.059
She did it because
there's a greater threat in this galaxy

19:30.169 --> 19:32.501
she thought you deserved to know about.

19:33.272 --> 19:36.241
She told the truth
in order to open your eyes.

19:38.744 --> 19:42.680
To show you the dangers of giving away
your freedom, your free will,

19:42.781 --> 19:45.147
in the hopes that, given another chance,

19:45.684 --> 19:48.482
you wouldn't make
that same mistake twice.

19:50.122 --> 19:52.818
We know a Prior of the Ori has come here.

19:53.058 --> 19:55.822
He's been sent to this village
to convince you to worship beings

19:55.928 --> 19:58.089
more powerful than all of us.

19:58.631 --> 20:01.429
But you must know that, like Vala,

20:03.068 --> 20:04.365
they're not gods.

20:05.304 --> 20:08.899
PRlOR: You speak well,
Daniel Jackson of the planet Earth.

20:10.476 --> 20:11.943
What is a god?

20:14.246 --> 20:16.180
What power is great enough

20:16.282 --> 20:19.308
to make you bow down
in humble reverence?

20:21.020 --> 20:24.478
(WHISPERING) That's the one that tried
to burn us to death. Twice.

20:25.090 --> 20:27.058
There's only one measure.

20:27.159 --> 20:31.493
The only question you may
ask yourself is, "Why must I believe?"

20:32.898 --> 20:37.267
What is there for any and all to gain
by choosing the Path of Origin?

20:39.038 --> 20:43.372
Those seeking eternal salvation can
follow the word of the Ori.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.539
Those that do not shall die as mortals.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.614
It is as simple as that.

20:50.649 --> 20:52.947
The day of reckoning approaches.

20:54.386 --> 20:56.183
Your destiny awaits.

20:59.625 --> 21:01.388
He's pretty good, too.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.854
We are so dead.

21:05.431 --> 21:08.867
I have told them of the Ori, Prior.
Many of us believe.

21:10.502 --> 21:12.470
But not all of us.

21:12.604 --> 21:15.334
-You doubt the power of the Ori?
-No.

21:16.141 --> 21:18.473
But I understand how they got it.

21:18.577 --> 21:21.341
And because I do, I'm not willing
to abandon my own free will

21:21.447 --> 21:22.641
and worship them for it.

21:22.748 --> 21:26.047
The Ori healed this man,
this man that was sick.

21:26.151 --> 21:27.641
This man who could barely walk.

21:27.753 --> 21:30.347
This man was healed through knowledge.

21:30.856 --> 21:32.221
We have medicine.

21:32.324 --> 21:34.884
We have tools
that can do much the same thing.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.955
This device

21:38.998 --> 21:40.488
has the power to heal,

21:42.201 --> 21:45.796
if you know how to use it,
but not by magical power.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.563
It's called technology.

21:47.673 --> 21:50.540
-Technology?
-Yes. Knowledge, understanding.

21:51.010 --> 21:54.275
Of the way things work,
of the science of the universe.

21:54.380 --> 21:55.608
Maybe so.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.942
But consider this.

21:58.417 --> 22:00.009
There are two men,

22:00.386 --> 22:03.651
one is starving,
and the other has a plentiful crop.

22:04.490 --> 22:08.551
Is it not wrong for the fortunate man
to hoard his harvest?

22:09.395 --> 22:12.262
Should he not share
with his hungry brother?

22:12.364 --> 22:13.490
(PEOPLE WHISPERING)

22:13.599 --> 22:17.399
It is the same
with knowledge and understanding.

22:18.604 --> 22:22.700
As you have said, the Ori have
a greater understanding of the universe,

22:22.841 --> 22:26.277
but most importantly,
they are willing to share it with us

22:26.378 --> 22:30.212
out of their love for us, their creation.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.942
Only a fool would turn away.

22:34.853 --> 22:38.220
Just because the Ori
know more than we do

22:38.323 --> 22:40.348
doesn't make them gods.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.688
They are beings
who were once like you and me,

22:45.631 --> 22:46.962
but they evolved.

22:47.466 --> 22:50.230
They learned of humanity's potential.

22:50.636 --> 22:52.695
Eventually, over time,
they used that knowledge

22:52.805 --> 22:54.534
to shed their physical bodies

22:54.640 --> 22:58.542
and live as energy on another,
higher plane of existence.

22:59.344 --> 23:01.073
Which side is he on?

23:01.180 --> 23:03.910
You are all children of the Ori,

23:04.016 --> 23:06.917
but you have been raised by evil.

23:07.019 --> 23:10.614
The true nature of the universe
has been kept from you

23:10.722 --> 23:14.021
by powers that would have you stray
from the Path of Origin.

23:14.526 --> 23:16.687
It is time to open your eyes.

23:17.529 --> 23:19.690
Let Origin show you the way.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.991
JACKSON: No, you're right.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.566
Maybe hoarding knowledge is wrong.

23:30.342 --> 23:31.969
Or maybe it's not.

23:33.278 --> 23:37.476
Maybe learning something for yourself
is part of the journey to enlightenment.

23:40.519 --> 23:44.250
But killing someone
for not worshipping you,

23:44.756 --> 23:47.224
regardless of your power, is wrong.

23:48.627 --> 23:49.958
Very wrong.

23:51.163 --> 23:52.790
Knowledge is power,

23:53.632 --> 23:58.535
but how you use that power
defines whether you are good or evil.

23:59.905 --> 24:01.998
The choice is yours.

24:02.975 --> 24:06.706
Give us another chance, I beg you.
Please, spare us all.

24:09.581 --> 24:11.981
Believe in the power of the Ori

24:15.654 --> 24:17.747
or be laid down in the dust.

24:34.506 --> 24:37.066
Escort the prisoner back to the cell.

24:37.743 --> 24:40.007
-Wait.
-We are done with the Mal Doran.

24:40.145 --> 24:43.774
We must vote now on her punishment
and discuss other issues we now face.

24:43.882 --> 24:48.148
Azdak, I know what the Ori seem to be
offering you may sound very tempting.

24:49.254 --> 24:51.154
We are poverty-stricken.

24:51.256 --> 24:54.191
As a society, we may not be able
to survive much longer.

24:54.293 --> 24:56.853
We thought our god would provide for us.

24:56.962 --> 25:00.728
Why should we reject the knowledge
and education to better ourselves?

25:00.832 --> 25:03.300
But you can have all that
without giving up your freedom.

25:03.402 --> 25:05.165
Don't you see how wrong it is
to enforce belief

25:05.270 --> 25:07.738
by threatening your people
with their very lives?

25:07.839 --> 25:09.500
As the Ori said,

25:09.741 --> 25:13.006
would we not be ignorant
and deserving of punishment

25:13.879 --> 25:16.905
for failing to see the plain truth before us?

25:21.787 --> 25:24.483
Leave us. We shall deliberate.

25:43.809 --> 25:46.107
Comfortable where you're living?

25:46.278 --> 25:49.111
I kind of like the place I'm renting
in Cimarron Hills.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.307
It's nice. You ought to buy.

25:52.251 --> 25:53.582
Well, I'll just wait and see.

25:53.685 --> 25:56.449
I don't know how long
I'm going to be here, so...

25:58.824 --> 26:00.052
How's your mother?

26:02.327 --> 26:05.455
Why don't you call her
and find out for yourself?

26:05.964 --> 26:09.365
Why does everything have to be
so hostile? I'm trying.

26:10.636 --> 26:14.072
To tell you the truth,
I don't even really know where to start.

26:14.740 --> 26:18.073
Start what?
The long road back to "happily ever after"?

26:18.277 --> 26:20.711
-I had a job to do.
-As I do.

26:21.913 --> 26:25.872
Now, I thought this was supposed to be
a professional meeting about my staff.

26:25.984 --> 26:27.713
That's why I'm here.

26:30.188 --> 26:31.485
Excuse me.

26:47.205 --> 26:49.901
You need to work on your anti-Ori speech.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.774
That Prior almost had me believing.

26:52.878 --> 26:55.938
Well, not so much believing
as willing to say I believe.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.208
I know.

27:00.152 --> 27:03.553
You are asking people to stand up
and put their lives on the line.

27:03.655 --> 27:05.646
I really believe it's the only way

27:05.757 --> 27:07.657
we're gonna have to defend ourselves
against them.

27:07.759 --> 27:09.818
We could try shooting them.

27:10.162 --> 27:11.823
You said the Priors are human, right?

27:12.531 --> 27:16.058
A few well-aimed shots
might at least get their attention.

27:16.168 --> 27:18.796
Well, you study enough religions,
you find that killing the missionaries

27:18.904 --> 27:20.963
doesn't combat the overall philosophy.

27:21.540 --> 27:24.873
The problem is that what the Priors
are offering sounds quite good.

27:24.976 --> 27:28.935
Until you get to the whole prostrating
and burning people alive bits.

27:29.047 --> 27:33.609
There's that, and I don't think any
of us have read the real fine print yet.

27:34.419 --> 27:35.511
Meaning?

27:35.620 --> 27:38.680
Well, I personally know without a doubt
the Priors are bad.

27:38.790 --> 27:40.087
So creepy.

27:40.859 --> 27:43.828
And "believe or die"
is an archaic moral standing.

27:43.929 --> 27:45.556
Now, the Ori are wrong for doing
what they're doing,

27:45.664 --> 27:48.462
but the part I haven't figured out yet,
the part that's really bothering me,

27:48.567 --> 27:50.535
is why they're doing it.

27:50.635 --> 27:53.297
I mean, why do they care if people
worship them or not?

28:08.587 --> 28:11.055
We have decided to spare your life.

28:12.057 --> 28:13.319
Really?

28:13.859 --> 28:14.883
Thank you.

28:14.993 --> 28:18.861
Your punishment will be imprisonment
for the rest of your life.

28:20.265 --> 28:21.425
What?

28:21.533 --> 28:25.094
Azdak, after everything
we've been through together.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.530
You made me rub your feet.

28:31.610 --> 28:33.475
Weren't you justly rewarded?

28:33.578 --> 28:37.947
Anyway, the odd massage here and there
hardly warrants life imprisonment.

28:38.049 --> 28:41.143
You lied and abused the people
of this planet.

28:41.253 --> 28:42.515
What about the Prior?

28:42.621 --> 28:44.782
Wait a minute.
We're not done here with me yet.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.255
Yes, we are.

28:47.025 --> 28:49.755
As for the Prior, the settlement is divided.

28:50.262 --> 28:53.060
Many believe the Ori
are worthy of our devotion.

28:53.432 --> 28:54.660
And you?

28:56.034 --> 28:57.365
MAN: Vachna has fallen ill.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.300
That's the man the Prior healed.

28:59.404 --> 29:01.065
-Yes.
-Please hurry.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.573
We fear he might be close to death.

29:03.675 --> 29:05.074
Wait, Azdak!

29:07.546 --> 29:09.275
Maybe we can help.

29:12.017 --> 29:14.781
-I do not want you near me.
-Take it easy!

29:14.886 --> 29:17.377
It's okay. She's not gonna hurt him.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.260
There. How do you feel now?

29:35.073 --> 29:37.041
What have you done to me?

29:38.176 --> 29:41.270
Making people feel good
is a natural talent of mine.

29:41.379 --> 29:42.869
Can you sit up?

29:45.550 --> 29:47.017
I do not understand.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.685
How did you do it?

29:49.988 --> 29:52.183
Well, this is a tool.

29:53.024 --> 29:56.460
Like a hammer or a shovel,
just a lot more complicated.

29:57.062 --> 29:59.121
Just because you don't understand
something at first

29:59.231 --> 30:00.926
doesn't mean it's the magic of the gods.

30:06.605 --> 30:11.565
AZDAK: You think that if we are united and
tell this Prior we will not heed his word,

30:11.743 --> 30:14.303
he will merely go away
and leave us alone?

30:14.412 --> 30:16.243
Well, I wish I could say
for sure what will happen.

30:16.348 --> 30:18.441
All I know is that you have to make
a stand.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.745
Whatever happens,
we'll be here to back you up.

30:20.852 --> 30:24.344
But ultimately,
it's gonna be up to you and your people.

30:25.790 --> 30:28.281
In exchange for saving Vachna's life,

30:28.426 --> 30:31.987
I have decided to reopen the issue
of your life imprisonment.

30:32.097 --> 30:33.394
Thank you.

30:33.632 --> 30:35.463
I have to admit,
it did make me feel rather good.

30:35.567 --> 30:37.398
I'm sure you thought
that might be a reward.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.993
-That's not why I did it.
-AZDAK: Speaking of rewards,

30:40.105 --> 30:43.871
the entirety of your property will be
kept here as payment for your crimes.

30:43.975 --> 30:45.636
Now, hang on a minute.

30:47.946 --> 30:49.413
You all right?

30:49.548 --> 30:52.210
Yes, it's just been a very long day.

30:52.784 --> 30:55.082
Azdak, you must come quickly.

30:55.186 --> 30:57.586
-What is it?
-Many have fallen ill.

31:22.213 --> 31:23.510
Thank you.

31:26.017 --> 31:29.453
-You are truly blessed.
-Well, I don't know about that.

31:30.255 --> 31:32.723
I'm just doing the best that I can.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.560
How many have fallen ill?

31:36.294 --> 31:38.592
I've lost count, but it's a lot.

31:39.965 --> 31:42.092
Whatever this thing is,
it's spreading like wildfire.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.464
Come on, we need you over here.

31:45.770 --> 31:48.170
We'll talk about my treasure later.

31:49.374 --> 31:52.002
We're doing our best
to quarantine the sick.

31:52.110 --> 31:55.079
Vala 's using the healing device to cure
them as they come in,

31:55.180 --> 31:57.171
but they're piling up pretty quick.

31:57.282 --> 31:59.580
-Symptoms?
-Weakness, high fever.

31:59.684 --> 32:01.549
Chest and stomach pains.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.516
They ha ve trouble breathing.
Some of the extreme cases

32:05.624 --> 32:07.819
ha ve gone into shock
before Vala could even get to them.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.223
It doesn't sound like we're dealing

32:09.327 --> 32:12.228
with something transmitted
from person to person. Not that fast.

32:12.330 --> 32:15.788
We could be looking at a common source,
possibly water or food.

32:15.900 --> 32:18.562
I'd say we know the source.

32:18.670 --> 32:21.969
Looks like these Priors wanna show us
they're gonna play hardball.

32:22.073 --> 32:24.871
Well, they're definitely trying
to establish some credibility, sir.

32:24.976 --> 32:27.103
How are you and your team, Colonel?

32:27.412 --> 32:31.849
Yeah, we're fine,
but I reckon we could use some backup.

32:32.584 --> 32:34.176
On the way, Colonel.

32:34.285 --> 32:35.980
Thank you, sir.

32:41.359 --> 32:42.826
You all right?

32:46.598 --> 32:47.587
No.

32:53.204 --> 32:55.604
-You can do this.
-I'm not so sure.

32:57.008 --> 32:59.272
I know using that hand device
must be taking a lot out of you,

32:59.377 --> 33:02.710
but we really,
really need your help right now.

33:02.881 --> 33:06.476
Each one is getting harder.
Each time it takes longer.

33:06.584 --> 33:09.576
And they keep coming. I don't think
I can save this whole village, Daniel.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.383
You have to keep trying.

33:11.556 --> 33:13.820
MITCHELL ON RADIO:
Jackson, we got a problem here.

33:15.060 --> 33:17.824
-Give me a minute.
-Now, please.

33:28.606 --> 33:31.871
-He was just fine.
-Well, he's not fine now.

33:32.944 --> 33:34.468
I healed him.

33:35.480 --> 33:38.040
If they can get reinfected,
this will never end.

33:38.149 --> 33:40.208
AZDAK: We must give in.

33:40.318 --> 33:42.218
They're too powerful.

33:42.320 --> 33:43.309
No.

33:45.056 --> 33:47.616
It's okay, I'm here.

33:57.202 --> 33:59.727
-Carolyn...
-I'm chief medical officer on this base.

33:59.838 --> 34:01.135
It's my call who goes on this mission.

34:01.239 --> 34:04.208
Given my work with the CDC,
infectious disease is my specialty.

34:04.309 --> 34:06.504
I am easily the most qualified for this.

34:06.611 --> 34:08.602
I know. I'm your dad.

34:10.415 --> 34:13.907
I just came by to wish you luck,
and be careful.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.350
Thank you.

34:17.455 --> 34:18.717
I will.

34:25.830 --> 34:28.321
Hang in there. Don't give up yet.

34:39.611 --> 34:42.637
Hey, thanks for coming.

34:43.114 --> 34:46.413
-This is worse than I thought.
-Yeah, they're falling pretty fast.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.884
We're gonna need a place to work.

34:49.154 --> 34:50.382
This way.

34:59.798 --> 35:00.992
(CLEARS THROAT)

35:05.003 --> 35:06.061
What?

35:06.638 --> 35:08.936
This is not working anymore.

35:10.275 --> 35:12.436
-I'm sorry.
-You have to keep trying.

35:13.878 --> 35:15.209
I mean, at least put on a show,
keep their hopes up.

35:15.313 --> 35:16.837
I mean, we know you can do that.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.746
See, this is exactly why I never even
think about trying to help people.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.216
I'm terrible at it.

35:21.319 --> 35:23.651
Because of me, these poor souls
are either gonna die horribly

35:23.755 --> 35:26.451
or they're gonna give in to the Prior
in the hopes that he'll heal them.

35:26.558 --> 35:29.322
-It's not because of you.
-I cannot make them better.

35:29.427 --> 35:32.328
And if I hadn't have been so worried
about my precious treasure,

35:32.430 --> 35:34.921
I would never have opened my big fat
mouth and we never would've come here.

35:35.033 --> 35:36.864
Then these people would still
have to either convert to Origin

35:36.968 --> 35:38.230
or face the consequences.

35:38.636 --> 35:42.128
That's a dilemma the rest of our galaxy
is also gonna have to worry about.

35:42.574 --> 35:44.337
May I speak with you?

35:53.151 --> 35:55.984
I've pretty much ruled out
bacterial infection at this point.

35:56.087 --> 35:59.887
I'm treating with an antiviral cocktail.
We're just gonna ha ve to wait and see.

35:59.991 --> 36:03.017
Any idea why the hand device
seems to have lost its effectiveness?

36:03.127 --> 36:06.585
First, I'd have to understand
even remotely how that thing works.

36:06.698 --> 36:09.861
I do know it's not unheard of for viruses
to mutate and become immune

36:09.968 --> 36:11.765
to whatever's trying to attack it.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.633
Obviously, in this case we're dealing

36:13.738 --> 36:15.899
with something more than
just a garden-variety super bug.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.304
All right, I don't know if this helps or not.

36:17.408 --> 36:19.899
But we know the Ancients were
almost wiped out by a similar plague.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.309
I'm just bringing it up in case
there's something in the research

36:22.413 --> 36:24.574
-that's already been done.
-You think the Ori gave it to them?

36:24.682 --> 36:27.310
I am aware that SG-1
was infected with a virus

36:27.418 --> 36:30.285
and then cured by an Ancient
found frozen down in Antarctica.

36:30.388 --> 36:33.516
The symptoms and rate ofprogression
here are remarkably similar.

36:33.625 --> 36:37.061
Do you have any hypotheses as to why
we have not been affected?

36:37.195 --> 36:40.187
No, we're still Iooking at your blood work.
Excuse me.

36:43.101 --> 36:46.070
Feel my forehead. Am I hot?
Hotter than usual?

36:46.704 --> 36:48.763
Well, you know what I mean.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.201
I'm sorry.

36:52.343 --> 36:55.801
I'm sure you know how much I wanted
to walk in here and solve this.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.075
Hey, you wanted to be a doctor.

36:59.050 --> 37:02.213
I've seen some bad situations before,
but nothing Iike this.

37:02.320 --> 37:05.346
And based on that comparison,
what's your prognosis?

37:05.456 --> 37:08.391
If we don't make a big breakthrough
really soon,

37:08.493 --> 37:10.552
these people are gonna need a miracle.

37:10.662 --> 37:13.324
WOMAN ON RADIO: Dr. Lam,
you're needed immediately.

37:14.265 --> 37:16.392
I ha ve to go. Lam out.

37:20.004 --> 37:21.437
This is bad, right?

37:21.906 --> 37:24.932
The virus is shutting down
his internal organs.

37:25.543 --> 37:27.943
He can 't process toxins
within his own system.

37:28.046 --> 37:31.675
-He's essentially being poisoned to death.
-Can't give him more medicine?

37:31.783 --> 37:35.344
As it is, this may be the virus
bouncing back against treatment.

37:35.453 --> 37:38.945
I hate having to say this,
but there's nothing I can do.

37:56.107 --> 38:00.976
Time of death, 14 hours, 18 minutes after
preliminary symptoms were first noted.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.948
Remove the body and prep for autopsy.

38:10.088 --> 38:12.648
Could I have a minute with him first?

38:27.005 --> 38:29.303
This is the first, not the Iast.

38:29.540 --> 38:31.201
I've gotta get back to Colonel Mitchell.

38:44.622 --> 38:46.783
You did everything you could.

38:47.191 --> 38:48.749
VACHNA: He has returned!

38:48.993 --> 38:51.393
The Prior of the Ori has returned!

38:53.464 --> 38:55.227
You go ahead, Daniel.

39:05.043 --> 39:07.011
Please, you must save us.

39:08.312 --> 39:10.780
Forgive those blinded by ignorance.

39:11.049 --> 39:14.041
People are dying. Our children are dying.

39:14.752 --> 39:17.118
They will believe. They do believe.

39:17.221 --> 39:19.348
Still not all of you.

39:20.691 --> 39:22.784
They are not of us.

39:23.094 --> 39:26.325
-They do not speak for us.
-Why are you doing this?

39:26.564 --> 39:28.998
From the smallest seed of doubt

39:29.200 --> 39:32.727
springs forth
a mighty, poisonous tree of evil.

39:32.837 --> 39:34.998
Yeah, all right, cut the crap.

39:35.106 --> 39:37.199
This is my fault, all right?

39:37.375 --> 39:39.468
I'm the one who told these people
if they didn't bow down to you,

39:39.577 --> 39:44.241
bow down to the Ori, you might just
give up and go away. Well, I was wrong.

39:44.348 --> 39:45.940
I understand now.

39:46.884 --> 39:49.614
You don't have to kill them
to prove a point to me.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.654
Do you truly understand?

39:52.824 --> 39:55.156
I understand this isn't about you and me.

39:55.259 --> 39:58.660
-lt is about all the children of the Ori.
-VALA: Enough.

40:03.234 --> 40:05.031
Heal these people now.

40:05.136 --> 40:07.070
-JACKSON: Vala...
-No, Daniel, I've had it with the Ori.

40:07.171 --> 40:09.867
I think it's time we sent them a message.

40:09.974 --> 40:13.705
-Or will you heal them?
-Only their faith can heal them now.

40:13.845 --> 40:15.710
Then you are useless to us.

40:27.158 --> 40:28.591
Stop at once!

40:30.428 --> 40:33.989
Please, do not let their evil deeds
doom us.

40:34.632 --> 40:37.430
We all bow to the power of the Ori.

40:48.613 --> 40:51.047
Hallowed are the Ori.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.174
ALL: Hallowed are the Ori.

41:18.809 --> 41:20.037
Colonel?

41:21.946 --> 41:23.004
(GROANING)

41:23.314 --> 41:26.340
Wow, have you got a couple of aspirin?

41:27.985 --> 41:29.179
Dr. Lam.

41:29.687 --> 41:31.416
How are you feeling?

41:33.491 --> 41:34.651
Tingly.

41:35.893 --> 41:38.259
How about we pretend I didn't say that?

41:38.362 --> 41:41.991
Okay. You hang on, and I'II be right back.

41:46.237 --> 41:48.000
Hey, what did I miss?

41:56.047 --> 41:59.483
-Oh, my God.
-That's not all. Look.

42:28.346 --> 42:30.906
Tell others what you have seen today.
