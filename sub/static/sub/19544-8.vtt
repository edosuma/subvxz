WEBVTT

00:07.466 --> 00:11.425
It was the long-awaited day
of the Tenkaichi Budokai.

00:11.637 --> 00:16.597
As promised, Son Goku showed up
from the Next World.

00:18.394 --> 00:19.258
Yoo-hoo!

00:19.478 --> 00:20.843
--Goku!
--Father!

00:21.063 --> 00:23.770
Goku-5a! I've been waitin' for you!

00:23.982 --> 00:25.847
I missed you, too.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.482
Father...?

00:30.698 --> 00:33.110
Father!

00:33.325 --> 00:36.408
You sure are spirited, huh?
Looks like you're strong, like me.

00:42.251 --> 00:44.458
Goku...

00:44.670 --> 00:48.538
Okay, you've got 24 hours. Got it?

00:48.757 --> 00:50.497
Mm-hmm. Understood.

00:50.718 --> 00:51.833
We're off!

00:52.052 --> 00:56.796
The Tenkaichi Budokai is about to begin!

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074

02:28.398 --> 02:33.768
"Who is the World's Greatest?!
The Tournament Preliminaries Begin!!"

02:37.032 --> 02:38.897
Thank you very much.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.952
It looks like that group is
the final batch of contestants.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.621
Let's shoot this quick, and get to
the venue for the preliminaries.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.450
--Right!
--Hi! Where have you come from?

02:52.464 --> 02:56.423
H-Hey, haven't we seen
those two before somewhere?

02:56.635 --> 02:57.875
You think so?

02:58.095 --> 02:59.881
I'm sure I remember them from somewhere.

03:02.140 --> 03:05.473
Hi! Where have you come from?

03:05.686 --> 03:10.146
Where? I... I came from the Next World.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.114
What a kidder!

03:18.323 --> 03:20.530
I ain't kidding you.

03:23.120 --> 03:27.534
Um, so, that thing over your head
is an unusual accessory, right?

03:27.749 --> 03:31.537
Oh, this? This, see,
ain't a decoration; once you die--

03:39.177 --> 03:41.589
Piccolo ain't changed at all, huh?

03:41.805 --> 03:44.387
W-What's the big idea, breaking the camera?!

03:44.600 --> 03:46.807
Everything we shot up to now
is ruined, you know!

03:47.019 --> 03:49.510
H-How did that happen? That's strange.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.472
This has never happened before.

03:52.691 --> 03:56.900
Those who are changing,
please use these changing rooms.

03:57.112 --> 04:00.024
We don't have much time, so please hurry.

04:02.576 --> 04:07.036
Aw... I sure wanted to fight
together with the adults.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.703
l have to admit,

04:09.041 --> 04:12.454
with all of us entering,
| feel sorry for everyone else.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.123
E-Excuse me...

04:19.343 --> 04:22.210
You're looking a little pale. Are you all right?

04:22.429 --> 04:25.421
Leave me alone! My face is
supposed to be this color.

04:25.641 --> 04:28.223
E-Excuse us!

04:28.435 --> 04:30.972
--You got that?
--Uh-huh, got it.
--Sorry to keep you waiting!

04:31.188 --> 04:33.270
Sorry to keep you waiting so long.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.602
Okay, let's go.

04:36.818 --> 04:37.898
Let's go, Goten!

04:38.111 --> 04:39.612
Uh-huh!

04:56.213 --> 04:57.794
There are so many here!

04:58.006 --> 04:59.507
This is incredible, huh?

04:59.716 --> 05:01.581
They're all nothing but small fry.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.043
Oh? Is that...?

05:04.262 --> 05:06.514
Is that you guys?!

05:08.016 --> 05:09.597
Yo!

05:09.810 --> 05:13.302
What a wonderful day this is!
Imagine, being able to run into you!

05:13.522 --> 05:14.511
Wow, this bring backs memories!

05:14.731 --> 05:18.315
I've been waiting a long time
for you guys to enter once again!

05:18.527 --> 05:22.236
It wasn't Mister Satan that
defeated Cell, but you guys, right?

05:22.447 --> 05:25.029
I knew as much.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.528
To be honest, the Tenkaichi Budokais

05:27.744 --> 05:30.577
that didn't have you in them
were the very definition of dull.

05:30.789 --> 05:33.906
Man, were they low-level! Hmm?

05:35.293 --> 05:36.874
Are those others friends of yours?

05:37.087 --> 05:40.045
--Yeah.
--Oh, fine, fine! This looks most promising!

05:40.257 --> 05:44.296
You there, please don't blow up
the grounds like you did before.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.296
Whatever.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.048
This is starting to get exciting!

05:47.264 --> 05:51.348
This Tenkaichi Budokai is going
to be incredible! By the way,

05:51.560 --> 05:54.677
this has been bothering me,
but what is that ring over your head?

05:54.896 --> 05:58.434
Oh, I died. Back during the fight with Cell.

05:58.650 --> 06:01.187
I came back from the Next World
especially for today.

06:03.613 --> 06:07.276
Okay, okay! That's strange,
but with you guys, anything goes.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.234
Dead or alive, it's fine with me.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.620
Knowing you folks, you're sure to
make it through the preliminaries.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.667
All right, I will see you in the ring.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.962
Be sure to give us some fantastic matches!

06:24.509 --> 06:27.342
Those of you who want my autograph,
line up, line up!

06:27.554 --> 06:30.671
I will sign for the first 50 people at no charge!

06:30.891 --> 06:36.136
Satan! Satan! Satan!...

06:36.354 --> 06:38.845
They say that death is the only cure for stupid,

06:39.066 --> 06:41.648
but in his case,
he'd probably be the same dead.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.602
All of you who have come here,
we are now about to begin

06:44.821 --> 06:47.278
the preliminaries for
the Tenkaichi Tournament!

06:47.491 --> 06:50.358
The total count for participants
at this tournament,

06:50.577 --> 06:54.240
not counting the junior division, is 194!
From among you, only the 16

06:54.456 --> 06:57.573
who win their way through the
preliminary round will compete.

06:57.793 --> 06:59.829
However, the champion, Mister Satan,

07:00.045 --> 07:02.912
will be granted an unconditional berth,

07:03.131 --> 07:06.715
so we will choose the remaining
15 contestants right now.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.007
What are they doing?

07:08.220 --> 07:10.711
As usual, the preliminaries will be held

07:10.931 --> 07:12.842
using a punch machine, to ensure fairness.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.925
Those with the 15 highest
punch machine scores

07:16.144 --> 07:17.475
will clear the preliminary round.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.643
Punch machine?

07:19.856 --> 07:21.392
What's that?

07:22.400 --> 07:24.186
All right, then, to show you how it's done,

07:24.402 --> 07:28.486
let's have the champion,
Mister Satan, hit the punch machine,

07:28.698 --> 07:31.075
and show us all his score!

07:31.284 --> 07:34.617
All right, the champion,
Mister Satan, if you please...

07:42.921 --> 07:46.004
Who here will surpass me?!

07:53.598 --> 07:56.806
Good grief, there are plenty
of people here who surpass you.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.851
Go on, feel free to take as
many pictures as you like!

08:04.025 --> 08:06.687
How long is he going to be so full of himself?

08:09.156 --> 08:11.488
W-Why did our cameras all break?

08:12.576 --> 08:13.861
Piccolo-san...

08:14.077 --> 08:17.285
I broke all of the cameras in
the spectator seats, as well.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.079
Now, even if by some chance,
you get stripped of your disguise,

08:20.292 --> 08:22.908
the people at your school won't know it's you.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.368
Fight without worrying about that.

08:24.588 --> 08:26.829
Ah, thank you, Piccolo-san.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.460
What? What? What just happened?

08:29.676 --> 08:32.462
Oh, well. I'll just do this without the media.

08:50.614 --> 08:56.234
Th-There it is! 137! 137 points!

09:07.005 --> 09:08.745
Over here, over here!

09:14.137 --> 09:16.344
Okay, everyone, good luck!

09:16.556 --> 09:20.424
I'll be waiting for contestants
who can make me go all-out!

09:20.644 --> 09:24.387
Aw, man. The way this is headed,
Satan will win this time, too.

09:24.606 --> 09:27.268
All right, each contestant come take a number,

09:27.484 --> 09:30.317
and please line up at the punch machine.

09:30.528 --> 09:33.440
Okay, those little fellows who are
competing in the junior division,

09:33.657 --> 09:36.023
please gather around here!

09:36.243 --> 09:38.529
Good luck, "little fellows."

09:39.663 --> 09:42.075
I wonder if Tenshinhan is here.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.075
Good question.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.829
He said we'd probably never
see each other again, after all.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.999
Number 6, 97 points.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.216
Number 75, 61 points.

09:59.432 --> 10:03.892
Oh, this is an amazing score!
Number 76, 112 points!

10:04.104 --> 10:06.311
Tch, this is worthless.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.639
Okay, next is number 84.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.850
Hey, look! It's a woman!
And a fine woman, isn't she?

10:12.070 --> 10:14.277
Whoo, I'd like to fight her!

10:14.489 --> 10:17.401
Hey, don't use too much power.
You'll break the machine.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.403
I know.

10:24.958 --> 10:28.667
7-7-774?!

10:28.878 --> 10:31.005
E-Excuse me, but it appears
to have malfunctioned.

10:31.214 --> 10:32.249
One moment, please.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.626
I told you, don't overdo it!

10:34.843 --> 10:37.550
Oh, hush. It's hard to hold back.

10:37.762 --> 10:41.004
|-|t appears to be fixed,
now, so one more time.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.346
203 points...

10:53.611 --> 10:57.320
Number 85, 192 points...

10:59.367 --> 11:02.859
Number 86, 186 points!

11:06.499 --> 11:08.455
Number 87, 210 points!

11:08.668 --> 11:11.831
Th-This thing appears to be
completely broken down.

11:12.047 --> 11:14.379
Let's get a new punch machine ready.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.547
Right.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.250
Make way.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.345
No way...

11:56.925 --> 11:58.961
Aww, there he goes.

11:59.177 --> 12:02.965
|-|f that guy is going to
be entering, I'm leaving.

12:03.181 --> 12:05.297
There's no helping him, huh?

12:05.517 --> 12:08.475
Hey, aren't you surprised by that?

12:08.686 --> 12:10.813
That man wrecked the punch machine!

12:11.022 --> 12:13.308
Y-Yeah, I am surprised.

12:13.525 --> 12:15.140
|-|t's unbelievable!

12:15.360 --> 12:18.944
That group--| think they're all
probably part of the same bunch,

12:19.155 --> 12:21.862
but each of them just scored
around 200 points!

12:22.075 --> 12:25.317
A-And up until then,
the 139 points my papa recorded

12:25.537 --> 12:26.526
had been the highest score.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.532
|-|s that right?

12:29.874 --> 12:31.830
Th-Those who have not yet
finished the preliminary round,

12:32.043 --> 12:33.704
p-please wait just a moment.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.663
W-We will be getting a new
punch machine ready right away.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.258
Hey, Vegeta,

12:39.467 --> 12:42.800
they say the junior division
with the pee-wees is beginning.

12:43.012 --> 12:43.876
You want to go watch?

12:44.097 --> 12:49.057
Hmph, well, why not? It beats
hanging around this dull place.

12:52.188 --> 12:56.682
Here they come.
I wonder who those people are.

12:56.901 --> 12:57.856
--Oh?
--Huh?

12:58.069 --> 13:00.902
Hey, your friend is a girl, is she?

13:01.114 --> 13:02.570
She is a girl, right?

13:02.782 --> 13:03.988
Ah, yes.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.282
This is my friend, Videl-san.

13:07.996 --> 13:11.580
Way to go! She's quite a cute girl, isn't she?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.747
No, th-that's not...

13:13.960 --> 13:15.871
Trunks and the others' matches
are about to begin,

13:16.087 --> 13:17.372
so we're gonna go watch them.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.796
Hurry up and get your preliminary done, too.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.498
Right.

13:23.011 --> 13:25.593
I hope they restart the preliminaries soon.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.965
Y-You know them?

13:27.182 --> 13:28.388
Huh? Mm-hmm.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.343
The one wearing the bright
orange gi is my father.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.850
Eh?! B-But you said your father died!

13:36.065 --> 13:39.978
M-Mm-hmm, that's right.
That's why he has that halo over his head.

13:40.195 --> 13:43.437
W-Who are you people, anyway?

13:43.656 --> 13:46.147
Okay, after many years' absence,
the reconvening

13:46.367 --> 13:49.074
of the Tenkaichi Budokai
is about to get underway!

13:51.664 --> 13:53.200
First up is the junior division,

13:53.416 --> 13:56.032
where the little guys 15 years old
and under will compete for victory!

13:56.252 --> 13:57.458
And while it is the junior division,

13:57.670 --> 13:59.581
the grand prize is 10 million Zeni!

13:59.797 --> 14:02.379
And the runner-up prize is 5 million Zeni!

14:02.592 --> 14:06.050
Also, as a special attraction,
the little guy who is the victor

14:06.262 --> 14:09.470
will be awarded a special present,
by being allowed

14:09.682 --> 14:12.640
to fight against this magnificent man!

14:12.852 --> 14:16.344
Of course, by "this man,"
I mean the Tenkaichi Budokai champion,

14:16.564 --> 14:18.850
Mister Satan!

14:23.947 --> 14:29.283
Satan! Satan! Satan!

14:50.890 --> 14:53.097
A-Are you all right?

15:06.155 --> 15:08.487
Joking! l'm joking!

15:10.243 --> 15:11.107
Way to go!

15:11.327 --> 15:18.074
Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan!

15:18.293 --> 15:21.205
Wow, nice joke, Mister Satan.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.286
Y-Yeah, sure...

15:23.506 --> 15:25.667
All right then, in the time between
the end of the preliminaries

15:25.883 --> 15:28.169
and the start of the
junior division, please enjoy

15:28.386 --> 15:29.375
this special event we've prepared,
featuring Mister Satan!

15:38.313 --> 15:39.974
What is that thing?

15:40.189 --> 15:42.180
Of all things, it is a film that re-creates

15:42.400 --> 15:45.733
the actions Mister Satan took
during the Cell Games!

15:45.945 --> 15:51.906
It's called, "Our Savior, Mister Satan:
A Record of Glory"!

15:52.118 --> 15:53.949
What?! I wasn't told about this!

15:54.162 --> 15:56.369
Awesome! A re-creation of the Cell Games!

15:56.581 --> 15:59.243
All right! I've wanted to see this!

16:01.002 --> 16:03.243
Hey, he says there's a movie.

16:07.842 --> 16:11.005
Stop this! The TV studio
shot that on their own!

16:11.220 --> 16:13.472
I didn't have it made to boast!

16:13.681 --> 16:16.388
Oh, you! You're too modest.

16:16.601 --> 16:19.684
Everyone, do you want to see the movie?!

16:19.896 --> 16:22.683
All right! In that case,
let's all do the Satan Call!

16:22.899 --> 16:25.106
--Hey, just a minute!
--Satan!

16:25.318 --> 16:32.156
Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan!

16:32.367 --> 16:34.198
Yeah!

16:34.410 --> 16:38.323
All right then, everyone,
please enjoy the movie!

16:56.766 --> 16:58.472
Ha! What is that?!

16:58.685 --> 17:01.017
We're gonna defeat you!

17:05.273 --> 17:07.013
Oh, wow...

17:13.866 --> 17:15.151
I'll strike back at you!

17:15.367 --> 17:16.858
Here goes!

17:21.790 --> 17:23.452
Hmph, this is ridiculous.

17:23.667 --> 17:27.911
Don't be so mad.
This is pretty entertaining, ain't it?

17:28.131 --> 17:31.248
What's the matter? Is that all you've got?

17:31.467 --> 17:34.334
D-Damn it!

17:35.722 --> 17:38.134
I guess that means I won, huh?

17:38.349 --> 17:39.850
Hold on!

17:47.358 --> 17:48.268
It's Satan!

17:48.484 --> 17:50.020
Wah! How cool!

17:50.236 --> 17:52.397
Go let Cell have it!

17:52.613 --> 17:54.649
Th-This is embarrassing!

17:54.866 --> 17:57.903
I wish they'd have at least
not gone with that face!

17:59.245 --> 18:00.746
You fool!

18:05.752 --> 18:06.707
Who's the fool now?!

18:06.919 --> 18:07.954
What?!

18:08.171 --> 18:09.752
H-How did you get there?!

18:09.964 --> 18:12.626
Your tricks won't work on me!

18:12.842 --> 18:15.333
Go, Satan!

18:16.429 --> 18:18.044
Enough of you!

18:21.142 --> 18:23.258
I told you, that won't work!

18:24.604 --> 18:28.722
H was wrong! Forgive me!
I won't do any mischief again!

18:28.941 --> 18:35.232
Oh, no! I declare by my fists that
you will pay for your misdeeds!

18:43.331 --> 18:46.664
A-Amazing! That's the great Satan for you!

18:52.381 --> 18:53.917
Justice prevails!

18:56.260 --> 19:02.847
Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan!

19:03.059 --> 19:06.472
You know, when a falsehood goes this far,
it's something else, huh?

19:06.687 --> 19:09.815
Wow, fantastic! Absolutely fantastic!

19:10.024 --> 19:11.980
Huh? Mister Satan?

19:12.193 --> 19:14.024
Satan-san?

19:14.237 --> 19:15.067
That was so embarrassing!

19:15.279 --> 19:18.021
Wow, that's our champion! So modest!

19:18.241 --> 19:19.731
Shut up!

19:24.247 --> 19:26.158
All right! I'm gonna make sure I win,

19:26.374 --> 19:28.956
and get Mister Satan's autograph!

19:31.337 --> 19:34.170
Hey, what are you buying
with the prize money?

19:34.382 --> 19:35.872
Toys and candy.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.832
You're such a little kid, Goten.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.553
What about you, Trunks-kun?

19:39.762 --> 19:41.753
What willl get if it's me?

19:41.973 --> 19:44.965
Trunks-kun, your family
is the richest in the world,

19:45.184 --> 19:47.345
so there's nothing you want, is there?

19:48.855 --> 19:53.645
Ha! Everyone here looks so weak and lame!

19:59.574 --> 20:01.860
Which one is your first opponent?

20:03.286 --> 20:07.325
Lucky me, lucky me!
He's the runt standing over there.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.532
Oh, he'll be easy to beat!

20:10.751 --> 20:12.662
Let's go pick on him for a bit.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.119
Yeah, okay.

20:14.338 --> 20:17.421
Hmm, come to think of it,
I haven't thought about what I want.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.589
Yo, pipsqueak!

20:19.802 --> 20:22.384
Hey, kid whose butt I'm gonna kick!

20:22.597 --> 20:24.713
Did you make sure to wear your diaper?

20:32.481 --> 20:34.312
Don't wet yourself.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.776
Get lost, idiot!

20:39.989 --> 20:41.570
And take your lame hairstyle with you!

20:41.782 --> 20:44.615
--What did you say?!
--W-Why, you...!

20:45.912 --> 20:48.028
That was the wrong thing to say to me!

20:48.247 --> 20:51.489
I've just decided that I'm going
to beat you half to death!

20:51.709 --> 20:53.245
Oh, yeah?

20:54.795 --> 20:56.501
How did you like our special event,

20:56.714 --> 21:00.172
"Our Savior, Mister Satan: A Record of Glory"?

21:00.384 --> 21:02.591
And now, it's time to begin the junior division

21:02.803 --> 21:06.295
of the Tenkaichi Budokai!

21:06.515 --> 21:10.133
It looks like the tournament
has gone all razzIe-dazzle, huh?

21:10.353 --> 21:12.890
Even the ring is bigger than before.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.812
Hmph, it's turned into a dog and pony show.

21:16.025 --> 21:18.767
Look! It's Trunks and Goten!

21:18.986 --> 21:23.229
At last, the Tenkaichi Budokai's
junior division has begun.

21:23.449 --> 21:26.316
How much strength do the little challengers,

21:26.535 --> 21:29.823
Trunks and Goten, really have?

22:41.902 --> 22:43.483
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:43.696 --> 22:46.938
Ah, looks like this junior division
thing has started, huh?

22:47.158 --> 22:48.989
Goten and Trunks, good luck to you both!

22:49.201 --> 22:52.159
Son Goku-kun's son, is it?
I can expect a lot from him!

22:52.371 --> 22:56.159
That long-ago sense of excitement
is waiting for me once again!

22:56.375 --> 22:58.036
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:58.252 --> 23:01.619
"Everyone is Surprised!
Goten and Trunks' Super Battle!!"

23:01.839 --> 23:05.457
Aw, the match between
those two is beginning!

23:06.305 --> 23:12.366
