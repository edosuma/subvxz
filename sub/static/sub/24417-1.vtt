00:13.780 --> 00:17.016
- That son of a bitch, I'm
fuckin' done with this.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.051
- Get back in there.
- I'm not goin', fuck that.

00:19.052 --> 00:20.753
That fucking prick, I'm
tired of his shit.

00:20.754 --> 00:25.025
I'm gonna rip his
fuckin' face off.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.749
- I'm gone two minutes, you
get my partner all riled up.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.419
How do you do that?

00:55.555 --> 00:58.290
Who said you could
smoke in here?

00:58.291 --> 00:59.691
- Your partner outside did.

00:59.692 --> 01:01.193
- Yeah.
- Hell of a guy.

01:01.194 --> 01:03.128
- Yeah he's a great guy,
but now it's just us,

01:03.129 --> 01:04.830
we're gonna start fresh.

01:04.831 --> 01:06.099
Clean slate.

01:07.667 --> 01:09.069
State your name.

01:10.603 --> 01:12.105
- Kook Packard.

01:19.846 --> 01:21.114
- Full name.

01:24.284 --> 01:25.851
- Kook

01:25.852 --> 01:26.852
Packard.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.489
- One more time.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.166
- Kookie.

01:43.169 --> 01:45.405
- Packard, Kookie Packard.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.340
- How 'bout you, Daniels,
you got a first name?

01:48.341 --> 01:50.310
- That's not important.

01:53.746 --> 01:55.614
You mind puttin' that smoke out?

01:55.615 --> 01:57.250
- Smoke bother you?

02:03.389 --> 02:04.890
You know what bothers
me, Daniels?

02:04.891 --> 02:09.261
Being detained on suspicion
without being charged.

02:09.262 --> 02:11.130
I mean, it's obvious that
you guys got nothing

02:11.131 --> 02:14.433
despite my good humor
for God knows how long.

02:14.434 --> 02:16.502
I mean, I can't even enjoy
a fucking cigarette

02:16.503 --> 02:17.736
or get a cup of coffee.

02:17.737 --> 02:19.138
- Oh, I'm sorry, you
want a cup of coffee?

02:19.139 --> 02:22.175
- I would love one,
cream and sugar.

02:23.643 --> 02:24.643
- No cream.

02:25.845 --> 02:27.479
No sugar.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.881
- Forget it.

02:28.882 --> 02:32.551
- What's your relationship
with Miss Lang?

02:32.552 --> 02:33.552
- None.

02:35.221 --> 02:37.656
- Well, witnesses
seem to put you there

02:37.657 --> 02:38.891
the night of the murder.

02:38.892 --> 02:42.227
They also put you there
at the Lone Cafe.

02:42.228 --> 02:46.165
Witnesses also say they see
you leave late that night

02:46.166 --> 02:47.634
in a late-model Buick.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.603
It's a spectacular automobile.

02:51.604 --> 02:53.272
It's classic all-around.

02:53.273 --> 02:56.342
- 1965, reminiscent
of that Skylark.

02:58.711 --> 03:02.448
So, what is your
relationship with Miss Lang?

03:05.251 --> 03:09.254
- Well I'd be lying to you
if I told you there was one.

03:09.255 --> 03:12.391
I introduce myself
at the restaurant,

03:12.392 --> 03:15.194
bump into her again
outside, we hit it off.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.496
Went up for a cruise
on Mulholland.

03:17.497 --> 03:20.199
And then I dropped her off.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.301
- Where'd you drop her off at?

03:22.302 --> 03:27.272
- A coffee shop on Franklin,
said she was meeting a friend.

03:27.273 --> 03:30.776
- Then after that I grabbed a
milkshake at Mel's Drive-In

03:30.777 --> 03:34.514
over on Highland, and
then I drove home, and

03:35.615 --> 03:38.851
slapped in the Three
Stooges marathon.

03:40.954 --> 03:43.222
You know, you kind of remind
me of one of the stooges.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.390
- Is that so?

03:48.328 --> 03:50.963
- You want to know which one?

03:50.964 --> 03:52.798
- No, I don't.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.266
- Schtoopee.

03:54.267 --> 03:56.768
- No, well he was brilliant.
- Yeah?

03:56.769 --> 03:58.671
- Yeah, came and went.

04:04.544 --> 04:06.378
You want to know what the
real joke is, Daniels?

04:06.379 --> 04:08.381
- What's that Kookie?

04:11.284 --> 04:14.486
- Is that I'm still here
talking in circles.

04:14.487 --> 04:18.423
- You know what else
is great, Kookie?

04:18.423 --> 04:20.426
Is that I love circles.

04:21.661 --> 04:24.297
And to be frank, I love my job.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.901
- That makes two of us.

04:31.304 --> 04:33.939
- I don't seem to have
any known addresses,

04:33.940 --> 04:37.009
phone numbers, any
information on you.

04:37.010 --> 04:40.412
- It's because I, I'm
in between homes,

04:40.413 --> 04:42.347
and I don't have a cell phone.

04:42.348 --> 04:43.815
- What was your
previous residence?

04:43.816 --> 04:45.384
- I don't have one.

04:45.385 --> 04:46.918
- You said you were
in between homes.

04:46.919 --> 04:50.356
- Well that's because
I am, literally.

04:52.358 --> 04:55.594
I live in a mobile home, out
there in Santa Clarita.

04:55.595 --> 04:59.365
It's a great location,
gorgeous sun rises.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.301
- Right.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.302
No cell phones.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.070
- No, no I don't
believe in them.

05:05.071 --> 05:06.439
Brain cancer.

05:18.451 --> 05:19.619
- Okay, so...

05:24.357 --> 05:27.927
What's your relationship
with Mickey Rady?

05:35.101 --> 05:36.769
- Don't know him.

05:44.077 --> 05:47.547
Los Angeles, the City
of Angels they say.

05:49.782 --> 05:52.785
Everybody here is
living the dream.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.755
If the American Dream
means to have it all,

05:56.756 --> 05:58.825
who do you take it from?

06:00.860 --> 06:05.030
Name's Kook Packard,
or Bill, Joe, Tommy.

06:05.031 --> 06:09.368
I was even Francois once, but
my accent wasn't the best.

06:09.369 --> 06:13.705
Anyway, I consider myself
a professional friend.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.407
I grew up in the city
full of pipe dreamers,

06:15.408 --> 06:18.777
delusional bastards, and
yeah, smokin' hot broads.

06:18.778 --> 06:22.814
All of which I enjoy
taking advantage of.

06:22.815 --> 06:26.418
I drink too much,
smoke like a chimney.

06:26.419 --> 06:27.786
I know what's going on today

06:27.787 --> 06:30.757
and that's all I
give a shit about.

06:32.091 --> 06:34.126
Maybe someday things will turn
around but in the meantime

06:34.127 --> 06:36.094
I love making a living
off screwing over

06:36.095 --> 06:38.398
the scumbags any way I can.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.968
It's an exciting life.

06:45.838 --> 06:48.874
Sometimes the perks of the
job make it all worthwhile.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.843
Like this scum, for example.

06:51.844 --> 06:53.812
Now to me a grown man
selling kiddie porn mags

06:53.813 --> 06:56.748
should be tied up somewhere
and clubbed to death.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.450
But I'll take setting him
up for some jail time

06:58.451 --> 07:01.120
and having some nice new wheels.

07:06.926 --> 07:10.596
Ah, the Riviera, one
of my favorite models.

07:22.475 --> 07:25.577
Truth is, if there
is such a thing,

07:25.578 --> 07:27.946
I've been sideways for so long

07:27.947 --> 07:30.715
I don't know how
to live straight.

07:30.716 --> 07:32.484
Snapping up this sucker's
car actually makes me feel

07:32.485 --> 07:35.987
so damn good about myself
because he's a piece of shit.

07:35.988 --> 07:40.226
Guys like this, they just don't
deserve the finer things.

07:50.636 --> 07:54.573
I love every second I'm throwing
these guys to the wolves.

07:54.574 --> 07:57.809
Fortunately for me I got a
friend that keeps me busy.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.245
Well, I use that term loosely.

08:00.246 --> 08:01.980
He hates everybody.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.983
Anyway it's the closest thing
to a friend I've ever had.

08:04.984 --> 08:08.053
Happens to be one of the best
undercovers I've ever seen.

08:08.054 --> 08:10.122
Must be if he busted me.

08:12.959 --> 08:17.196
Ah, Mickey Rady, one of the
meanest bastards around.

08:27.673 --> 08:31.042
Oh, and in case you think I
write like a two year old,

08:31.043 --> 08:32.511
go fuck yourself.

08:36.082 --> 08:38.616
The past couple of years
we been working together.

08:38.618 --> 08:40.085
Every now and then
I get a fancy car

08:40.086 --> 08:43.621
for helping him out
and some nice cash.

08:43.623 --> 08:45.190
I mean, what can I say,
sometimes you give

08:45.191 --> 08:46.925
and sometimes you take.

08:46.926 --> 08:51.596
But if you do, make sure
it's from the right people.

08:51.597 --> 08:54.232
Because this tale right
here ladies and gents,

08:54.233 --> 08:58.571
this is the beginning of
where it all went wrong.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.889
I'm losing it.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.659
Gave this woman my real name.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.728
Can't believe I slipped.

09:23.629 --> 09:25.564
I think I'm falling for her.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.133
It's hard to tell.

09:28.167 --> 09:29.569
Her name is Eve,

09:32.972 --> 09:36.308
I been in this fuckin'
scum world so long

09:36.309 --> 09:40.178
I don't know what's real
and what's not anymore.

09:40.179 --> 09:43.181
What am I even fighting for?

09:43.182 --> 09:45.617
The good guy, the bad guy,

09:45.618 --> 09:48.353
there ain't no such thing.

09:48.354 --> 09:51.189
Everyone's got an agenda.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.124
And it's god damn nasty
what some people will do

09:53.125 --> 09:55.727
to get what they want.

09:55.728 --> 09:57.129
Myself included.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.605
- Hey.

10:07.239 --> 10:08.741
- Hey.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.912
You got a booking coming up?

10:13.913 --> 10:16.681
- Hollywood's calling.

10:16.682 --> 10:17.650
- God damn.

10:17.651 --> 10:22.855
Her eyes are open for a
minute and she's beautiful.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.728
You know all you gotta
do is let me know

10:29.729 --> 10:31.997
where you're gonna be.

10:31.998 --> 10:34.966
Come by, take some pictures,

10:34.967 --> 10:37.168
and split the profit with you.

10:37.169 --> 10:40.672
- Shoulda known shaggin' a
paparazzi's a bad idea.

10:40.673 --> 10:41.974
Get outta here.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.665
- My latest assignment
has me holed up

11:06.666 --> 11:09.835
in this shit hole
downtown apartment.

11:13.806 --> 11:16.142
Ah, sorry baby, can't talk.

11:17.410 --> 11:21.080
Wish I could but I'm
another guy right now.

11:25.384 --> 11:28.720
This place smells like
piss and cigarettes,

11:28.721 --> 11:30.021
probably from me.

11:30.022 --> 11:36.027
Yeah, you heard right, Eve
thinks I'm a fucking paparazzi.

11:36.028 --> 11:39.764
Whatever gets me
in, no shame here.

11:39.765 --> 11:41.400
I'm numb to it all.

11:54.814 --> 11:56.915
I used to be a cop for the good.

11:56.916 --> 12:00.852
To protect and serve
and all that bullshit.

12:00.853 --> 12:04.456
Now I protect myself and
serve whatever hell I can

12:04.457 --> 12:07.792
to the pieces of shit
this city produces.

12:07.793 --> 12:10.328
And I make damn sure I get mine.

12:10.329 --> 12:13.999
Just like everybody
else, I got my reasons.

12:19.271 --> 12:22.006
Got a call from Chief
McCoy this morning.

12:22.007 --> 12:23.509
He wants to talk.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.078
Can't fuckin' wait.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.481
- Well, sit.

12:30.416 --> 12:34.085
- Ah, this guy,
always up my ass.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.855
He's got something to prove.

12:36.856 --> 12:39.791
Sittin' there acting
like he can read.

12:39.792 --> 12:41.793
Playing the game.

12:41.794 --> 12:43.128
I'll help you buddy.

12:43.129 --> 12:45.463
Brown bangers and
Armenian drugs, huh?

12:45.464 --> 12:47.866
That's a recipe for disaster.

12:47.867 --> 12:50.802
- They'll light Boyle
Heights on fire.

12:50.803 --> 12:54.005
And my whole department with it.

12:54.006 --> 12:55.241
- Stack units?

12:58.978 --> 13:01.446
- Don't think I don't
see what you're doing.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.548
- What am I doing?

13:03.549 --> 13:07.852
- Your bust is now
running four weeks over,

13:07.853 --> 13:10.922
and I been looking
the other way.

13:10.923 --> 13:14.192
Now you're arresting people
on planted evidence.

13:14.193 --> 13:16.962
- Oh, shit.

13:18.497 --> 13:20.198
- Jamal Dean.

13:20.199 --> 13:23.134
- You son of a...
- Mm-hmm.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.805
Look, undercover has liberties,

13:26.806 --> 13:28.406
but you're too far out.

13:28.407 --> 13:29.841
- You are not messing this up

13:29.842 --> 13:31.242
for me, you bozo.

13:31.243 --> 13:33.945
Been working this
score for months.

13:33.946 --> 13:35.180
Please don't do anything stupid.

13:35.181 --> 13:37.215
- All over my department...

13:37.216 --> 13:39.417
- Oh, man.
- I sure as hell can't use

13:39.418 --> 13:43.822
a cop who's out there giving
them a reason to do so.

13:43.823 --> 13:48.560
I sure hope you appreciate
me cleaning up after you.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.461
- There's nothing to clean, Art.

13:50.462 --> 13:53.365
- Rady.
- Jamal Dean is my snitch.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.600
Don't know why you
just didn't ask me,

13:55.601 --> 13:59.137
what do you think
I booked him for.

13:59.138 --> 14:00.206
Oh God, Art.

14:03.275 --> 14:07.413
Look, I got a big coke and
hooker bust coming up.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.948
This is probably
the best publicity

14:09.949 --> 14:11.549
your department has
seen in months.

14:11.550 --> 14:13.151
It's an escort ring
that's running drugs,

14:13.152 --> 14:17.389
I found the source, and
he's high profile, and I am

14:18.891 --> 14:22.427
this close to finding out
where that next drop is.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.597
It's Armenian drugs, Art.

14:25.931 --> 14:29.934
You, the department need this
just as much as I want it.

14:29.935 --> 14:32.171
I need a little more time.

14:34.006 --> 14:35.006
- Okay.

14:36.175 --> 14:37.375
One week.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.977
You bring it in clean

14:38.978 --> 14:41.614
I may change my mind about you.

14:44.483 --> 14:47.986
- I guess I'll see you at the
press conference then, huh?

14:47.987 --> 14:49.121
Wear the blue tie.

14:51.624 --> 14:54.093
Extension comes with a bonus.

14:57.329 --> 14:59.664
That's a sliced hooker.

14:59.665 --> 15:02.934
Homicide doesn't know the
scene as well as you do.

15:02.935 --> 15:05.003
- Yeah, it's the only way
those ugly bastards get laid.

15:05.004 --> 15:08.139
- Oh come on, just see
what you can find.

15:08.140 --> 15:09.541
- Homicide, huh?

15:11.677 --> 15:13.913
Is this Lenny's case?

15:15.915 --> 15:19.217
- You know, I want those
bastards off the streets

15:19.218 --> 15:21.186
just as much as you do.

15:23.222 --> 15:25.057
Now you fuck this up,

15:26.425 --> 15:27.425
you're out.

15:29.461 --> 15:30.461
Mm-hmm?

15:46.045 --> 15:48.179
- Oh my lord, sit down,
quit acting silly

15:48.180 --> 15:50.315
it ain't working no more.

15:50.316 --> 15:52.250
- Why do you always got
to cut me down, huh?

15:52.251 --> 15:53.685
- Want me to tell you about him?

15:53.686 --> 15:54.520
- Yeah.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.355
Ah, my favorite dive.

15:57.990 --> 16:01.560
Good tunes, good whiskey,
and my gal Rosie.

16:03.262 --> 16:04.495
She gives great
advice sometimes,

16:04.496 --> 16:08.066
even though she's a Class
A fuck-up herself.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.034
But like I said, I'm a
professional friend,

16:10.035 --> 16:12.003
and Rosie's great for
free shots and 50 bucks

16:12.004 --> 16:13.371
for a couple of weeks.

16:13.372 --> 16:16.008
Hell, all I gotta do is listen.

16:23.248 --> 16:26.085
Want to tell me
how you found me.

16:27.419 --> 16:30.021
- Follow the trail
of Bourbon breath,

16:30.022 --> 16:31.289
wasted existence...

16:31.290 --> 16:33.057
- Yeah, yeah, look why
don't we cut this short

16:33.058 --> 16:34.759
and why don't you just tell
me what conjugal duties

16:34.760 --> 16:37.095
my brother fulfilled
this time around, huh?

16:37.096 --> 16:38.297
This is Aveline.

16:39.398 --> 16:43.102
And before I explain,
excuse me for a moment.

16:45.204 --> 16:46.738
- I got one hour.

16:46.739 --> 16:47.739
- Two would be better.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.040
- Shut up.

16:49.041 --> 16:52.010
- In case you were wondering,

16:52.011 --> 16:54.013
we've done this before.

17:06.458 --> 17:08.492
- Another one?
- Lori.

17:08.493 --> 17:10.161
A sweet kid.

17:10.162 --> 17:11.596
Normally I'd be
staring at her ass,

17:11.597 --> 17:13.397
but I'm just not
in the mood today.

17:13.398 --> 17:17.167
You know, you should start
giving discounts to police.

17:17.169 --> 17:19.337
- Now if I did that

17:19.338 --> 17:21.204
the streets would be
even more unsafe,

17:21.205 --> 17:25.108
'cause you'd all be in here
all day drinking beer.

17:25.109 --> 17:27.278
- It's what everybody
thinks we do anyway, right?

17:27.279 --> 17:30.115
- Well let's not
disappoint them.

17:32.484 --> 17:33.484
- Thanks.

17:38.090 --> 17:39.424
- Yes budget cuts have been made

17:39.425 --> 17:41.759
in the Los Angeles
Police Department.

17:41.760 --> 17:45.129
And now we're looking at
sky rocketing crime rates.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.632
- One more, Lori.

17:47.533 --> 17:48.533
Thanks.

17:52.271 --> 17:53.738
- I mean, does our police force

17:53.739 --> 17:55.173
work at the capacity...

17:55.174 --> 17:56.774
More bullshit.

17:56.775 --> 17:58.843
Can't get away from it.

17:58.844 --> 18:01.680
Wish I could snap
this guy's neck.

18:03.215 --> 18:04.215
Ah, great.

18:04.216 --> 18:05.349
- What's up buddy?

18:05.350 --> 18:06.285
- Couple of beers.

18:06.286 --> 18:09.420
- Two fucktards walk into a bar.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.655
What do you want?

18:10.656 --> 18:12.824
- I just can't stop in
and grab a beer now?

18:12.825 --> 18:16.094
- God, I would love
to break his face.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.162
- All right, all
right, you got me.

18:18.163 --> 18:20.298
This guy, hell of a
cop, huh, sharp.

18:20.299 --> 18:21.499
Relax, Mickey.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.702
- Just wanted to meet
up, compare notes.

18:24.703 --> 18:28.440
You're on my case, you're
on my team, right?

18:30.275 --> 18:33.678
- Well, the chief
assigned me, so.

18:33.679 --> 18:34.580
- Nice.

18:34.581 --> 18:37.215
They must be running out
of dirty vice pussies

18:37.216 --> 18:39.550
for you to investigate.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.186
- Mm, deep breaths.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.392
Lori, I want to get out of here.

18:48.393 --> 18:49.393
Thanks.

18:50.395 --> 18:52.196
- Alrighty, Mick,
you let me know

18:52.197 --> 18:54.500
when you got something, okay?

18:56.335 --> 18:57.335
- New suit.

18:58.837 --> 19:01.673
That was fun.

19:09.681 --> 19:11.283
- See you later.

19:13.418 --> 19:14.887
- Was I that bad?

19:20.559 --> 19:21.893
What'd you want to
talk about anyways,

19:21.894 --> 19:24.363
something wrong with the kid?

19:25.697 --> 19:26.698
- I'm late.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.937
- Well that's what I
get for having a kid

19:32.938 --> 19:34.839
with my brother's wife.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.574
Poor bastard has no
idea little Madison's

19:36.575 --> 19:38.477
not even his daughter.

19:39.811 --> 19:43.414
Or that his wife likes
being choked from behind.

19:43.415 --> 19:45.417
Christ she smells good.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.789
- Who'd have thought my only
friend is a fucking con artist.

19:51.790 --> 19:54.392
He's the best I've ever seen.

19:54.393 --> 19:56.460
And he gets his kicks
from the same stuff I do,

19:56.461 --> 19:59.530
so it makes working
together pretty easy.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.499
Do I trust him?

20:01.500 --> 20:03.368
That's a tough one.

20:04.303 --> 20:07.939
Like I said, everyone
has their own agenda.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.608
He hasn't let me
down yet though,

20:10.609 --> 20:13.878
and he's always stocked
with good beer.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.247
I been working on something,

20:16.248 --> 20:18.282
real big score.

20:18.283 --> 20:20.986
So let's see what
the doctor says.

20:27.693 --> 20:28.993
Want me to book you
for car theft,

20:28.994 --> 20:32.930
or possession of
illegal substances?

20:32.931 --> 20:34.666
- Guilty as charged.

20:35.701 --> 20:36.702
Come on in.

20:39.271 --> 20:40.471
- How you doin' pal?

20:40.472 --> 20:41.739
- I been better.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.876
- It smells like
a woman in here.

20:45.677 --> 20:47.478
- Want a beer?

20:47.479 --> 20:50.382
- What do you think,
I want a hug?

20:52.251 --> 20:55.621
And while you're up
have you got some ice?

20:57.022 --> 20:58.422
- What'd you do, blast somebody?

20:58.423 --> 20:59.258
- Yeah, a little bit.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.492
- Jesus Christ.

21:01.493 --> 21:02.494
Ah, no ice.

21:04.596 --> 21:05.430
Try this.

21:05.431 --> 21:06.964
- That'll do.

21:06.965 --> 21:07.965
Thanks.

21:12.537 --> 21:13.638
All right.

21:13.639 --> 21:14.940
- So what's up?

21:16.508 --> 21:21.279
- Chief raggin' on me today
about planted evidence.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.014
- Was it?

21:22.015 --> 21:24.349
- Well, it had to be done.

21:25.050 --> 21:26.817
Nice car you got out there.

21:26.818 --> 21:27.653
- Ain't that a beauty?

21:27.654 --> 21:28.719
- Sure is.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.721
- '65 Riviera.

21:30.722 --> 21:31.790
- Sharp car.

21:35.027 --> 21:38.429
You know, we booked that old
guy for child pornography.

21:38.430 --> 21:39.864
- Good, fuck 'im.

21:39.865 --> 21:43.034
- Nobody's missing him,
nobody's missing the Riviera.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.502
That car might come in handy

21:44.503 --> 21:47.038
for a little something
I've been checking into.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.873
- What's that?

21:48.874 --> 21:50.541
- I got a modeling
agency that's doubling

21:50.542 --> 21:52.910
as an escort service.

21:52.911 --> 21:55.012
- I already like
where this is going.

21:55.013 --> 21:56.747
- It's a coke running
escort service.

21:56.748 --> 21:58.516
- Even better.

21:58.517 --> 22:00.418
- It's a real opportunity
we got here.

22:00.419 --> 22:02.953
All we gotta do is find out
when the next trade off is,

22:02.954 --> 22:04.989
and we're gonna crash the deal,

22:04.990 --> 22:06.557
and go in there and
take half the cash,

22:06.558 --> 22:08.826
take half the coke, make
it disappear so it's even.

22:08.827 --> 22:11.329
I'm gonna stay there and
play it like a real bust.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.998
And that's it, it's
a straight shot.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.099
- What's the Kelley Blue Book?

22:15.100 --> 22:16.702
- Hundred grand.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.073
So let me show you what
I'm looking into here.

22:22.074 --> 22:24.475
I think you're gonna
like this, pal.

22:24.476 --> 22:27.411
This is the owner of
the escort service.

22:27.412 --> 22:29.447
Ms. Donna Lang.

22:29.448 --> 22:30.881
- Donna Lang.
- Remember her?

22:30.882 --> 22:33.050
- Are you kidding, I
grew up with this broad.

22:33.051 --> 22:34.652
Before your time.

22:34.653 --> 22:36.087
Nah, she's terrific.

22:36.088 --> 22:37.555
- Thought you'd appreciate that.

22:37.556 --> 22:39.023
Now this guy right
here is her supplier,

22:39.024 --> 22:41.359
might look familiar too.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.362
This is Connor Winkler.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.597
- As in Mayor Winkler's son?
- Yeah, that's junior.

22:46.598 --> 22:47.998
- Jesus Christ.

22:47.999 --> 22:50.601
- He's got his old man's
sense for politics.

22:50.602 --> 22:53.537
This guy here is running a
deal over with the Armenians.

22:53.538 --> 22:55.539
And it seems like his dick
can never say no to a chick.

22:55.540 --> 23:00.411
And lately he can't say no to
this one beautiful actress,

23:00.412 --> 23:01.146
right here.

23:01.147 --> 23:05.416
- Oh, well that's a given.

23:05.417 --> 23:09.720
- Also happens to be
one of Donna's girls.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.389
Got him.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.624
Doesn't take much
to get Kook going.

23:13.625 --> 23:17.828
Booze, boobs, and money, in
any order usually works.

23:17.829 --> 23:20.464
Anyway, this is the big one.

23:20.465 --> 23:21.466
Here we go.

23:22.534 --> 23:24.468
- Watch and learn kids.

23:24.469 --> 23:28.539
Excuse me, I'm Kook
Packard, investments.

23:28.540 --> 23:31.008
A good friend of
mine recommended

23:31.009 --> 23:33.144
your selection of hand models.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.646
- Of course Mr. Packard.

23:35.647 --> 23:37.114
I'll just have to get the book.

23:37.115 --> 23:40.452
- Hey, money does
buy you time, dear.

23:41.486 --> 23:44.423
Well, somebody needs a spankin'.

23:51.029 --> 23:52.663
3 p.m., three.

23:52.664 --> 23:53.864
Whatever happened
to pen and paper?

23:53.865 --> 23:54.865
2 p.m.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.177
- Here you go Mr. Packard.

24:05.178 --> 24:08.145
- Let's see what we have here.

24:08.146 --> 24:09.146
Let's see.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.117
Oh, hello.

24:15.554 --> 24:16.921
Take this beautiful
creature right here.

24:16.922 --> 24:18.122
- Great.

24:18.123 --> 24:21.225
- Let's say 2 p.m.
today for lunch, okay?

24:21.226 --> 24:22.226
- You got it.

24:22.227 --> 24:24.528
- Pleasure to meet you.

24:24.529 --> 24:27.465
You should be a hand
model yourself there.

24:27.466 --> 24:28.934
Nice meeting you.

24:35.207 --> 24:40.010
Nice to see a room full of
pretentious LA douchebags.

24:40.011 --> 24:42.546
And I just spotted my mark.

24:42.547 --> 24:45.483
I gotta say, this is a
personal thrill for me.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.084
I grew up watching
this woman on TV,

24:47.085 --> 24:50.554
and spent a lot of
lonely nights...

24:50.555 --> 24:51.789
- This suit your taste?

24:51.790 --> 24:52.257
- You know what I'm
talking about.

24:52.258 --> 24:53.924
Work for you?

24:53.925 --> 24:55.927
We'll take it. - Great.

24:58.063 --> 24:59.230
Here you go.

24:59.231 --> 25:00.965
- Oh, hey.
- Yes.

25:00.966 --> 25:05.503
- How 'bout a bottle of Louis
Gerdeaux Montrez Chez.

25:05.504 --> 25:09.240
- Be right back with that.
- Appreciate that.

25:09.241 --> 25:11.008
Well,

25:11.009 --> 25:14.778
my mom always taught me
that to charm a woman,

25:14.779 --> 25:18.183
a true gentleman must
pay her attention.

25:18.984 --> 25:20.218
So guess what,

25:21.253 --> 25:24.154
you've got my
undivided attention.

25:24.155 --> 25:28.192
- You really are a
gentleman, aren't you?

25:28.193 --> 25:29.293
- I try.

25:29.294 --> 25:30.861
Just not tonight, kid.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.030
'Cause there's my girl.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.966
Oh man, Donna fucking Lang.

25:35.967 --> 25:38.102
This might be my
favorite play yet.

25:38.103 --> 25:40.037
Comes close to the time I
convinced an old Hollywood

25:40.038 --> 25:42.306
producer that I was
his illegitimate son,

25:42.307 --> 25:45.042
and he paid for my whole
life for about a year.

25:45.043 --> 25:47.545
'Til the fucker died.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.280
Okay, here we go.

25:49.281 --> 25:50.181
- I know you.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.815
- Excuse me, pardon me.

25:51.816 --> 25:54.119
I didn't mean to interrupt.

25:55.587 --> 25:57.955
I could not help but invite
the great Donna Lang

25:57.956 --> 26:00.224
to a bottle of lowly Gerdeaux.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.326
This is a once in a
lifetime chance.

26:02.327 --> 26:04.628
First of all, my name
is Kook Packard.

26:04.629 --> 26:07.598
And I just want to say
that I am a tremendous,

26:07.599 --> 26:09.199
tremendous fan of your work.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.334
- Well, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

26:10.335 --> 26:11.636
- Yes.

26:13.939 --> 26:15.973
Not a quiet minute with
this one around, huh?

26:15.974 --> 26:17.675
- That's very charming, but
he doesn't have a clue

26:17.676 --> 26:18.776
what you're talking about, Mr.

26:18.777 --> 26:20.244
I'm sorry, what was your...

26:20.245 --> 26:21.912
- Packard, Packard, but
call me Kook, call me Kook.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.081
- Kook, okay.

26:24.649 --> 26:26.116
- Shirley Summers.

26:26.117 --> 26:27.585
- Don't know her.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.320
- No, no, no, no, that's
who Miss Lang portrayed.

26:29.321 --> 26:30.988
I mean, we are talking about

26:30.989 --> 26:35.025
one of the most iconic
characters in TV history.

26:35.026 --> 26:36.694
Oh, you know, I mean, this.

26:36.695 --> 26:38.128
What was that, just
a few years ago?

26:38.129 --> 26:41.332
- Oh, please it was
an eternity ago.

26:41.333 --> 26:42.800
- Oh, come on.

26:42.801 --> 26:44.101
- Why don't you have a
seat with us, darling.

26:44.102 --> 26:47.304
- No, I've interrupted enough.

26:47.305 --> 26:50.208
I just want to say
Miss Lang, that

26:52.210 --> 26:54.612
it truly is my
honor to meet you.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.180
I'm thrilled.

26:56.181 --> 26:57.015
- Thank you.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.382
- To meet you.

26:58.383 --> 26:59.683
- Thank you so much.

26:59.684 --> 27:00.784
- Nice to meet you to there.

27:00.785 --> 27:02.687
Please enjoy the wine.

27:04.889 --> 27:06.758
- What a gentleman.

27:09.728 --> 27:12.096
- And now we close the deal.

27:12.097 --> 27:13.765
Well we meet again.

27:15.333 --> 27:17.635
Have to met the
lovely Isabella here?

27:17.636 --> 27:21.639
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm gonna get the car.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.741
- Don't think
you're the only one

27:23.742 --> 27:25.142
paying for her company, okay.

27:25.143 --> 27:26.410
- I don't want hookers
wearing that, okay?

27:26.411 --> 27:28.312
- For God's sake, just
play along, will ya?

27:28.313 --> 27:29.947
Ha-hey. - Go to hell.

27:29.948 --> 27:30.948
- You too.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.217
- Hey what is that, suede?

27:33.218 --> 27:34.818
- Yeah, it's suede.

27:34.819 --> 27:37.655
- God, I just love
awkward moments.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.125
- Is that a 1965 green Riviera?

27:41.126 --> 27:42.060
- Like it?

27:42.061 --> 27:43.093
- That is my car, like it?

27:43.094 --> 27:44.395
- Ah ah, that's Shirley's car.

27:44.396 --> 27:46.430
- Oh my God, I love it.

27:46.431 --> 27:49.099
- Hey, want to go for a spin?

27:49.100 --> 27:51.101
- Come on, it's yours?

27:51.102 --> 27:52.704
- No I stole it.

27:53.838 --> 27:54.838
Come on.

27:55.774 --> 27:58.308
- Oh I'd love to, thank you.

27:58.309 --> 27:59.943
- After you, my lady.

27:59.944 --> 28:01.779
Thank you, Santos.

28:01.780 --> 28:04.014
How 'bout you guys,
want to come along?

28:04.015 --> 28:05.916
- No I think since
I got company,

28:05.917 --> 28:07.718
I'm gonna stay at the bar.

28:07.719 --> 28:09.720
- All right I'll tell
you what, why don't you

28:09.721 --> 28:11.221
watch out for the girl and

28:11.222 --> 28:13.757
I'll take the lady here.

28:13.758 --> 28:15.826
- Mulholland it is.

28:15.827 --> 28:17.695
- Let's roll, honey.

28:17.696 --> 28:18.829
- Whoo!

28:24.269 --> 28:26.136
- And that's how it's done.

28:26.137 --> 28:30.375
I should write a book, Me and
Donna Lang Sitting in a Tree.

28:32.877 --> 28:34.945
After about 10 minutes I
told Donna to pull over

28:34.946 --> 28:37.347
because the car was overheating.

28:37.348 --> 28:38.882
That was a lie.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.350
She's a doll, but
watching her drive

28:40.351 --> 28:42.853
is like watching a
blind kid play catch.

28:42.854 --> 28:44.889
Sooner or later,
they gotta stop.

28:49.461 --> 28:52.731
- Kookie, Kookie,
lend me your comb.

28:54.132 --> 28:55.766
You know, I think I still
have a copy of that record

28:55.767 --> 28:56.501
somewhere in my house.

28:56.502 --> 28:58.001
- You gotta be kiddin'.

28:58.002 --> 28:59.503
- That cannot be your real name.

28:59.504 --> 29:01.505
- Well it's about as
real as Shirley Summers.

29:01.506 --> 29:03.173
- Touche.

29:03.174 --> 29:06.009
- You know, you're not the
only one with a past.

29:06.010 --> 29:09.279
My dad was one of the
creators of 77 Sunset Strip.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.748
- Really.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.049
I believe I read for
that show once.

29:12.050 --> 29:13.517
- You probably did.

29:13.518 --> 29:14.952
Actually my two older brothers,

29:14.953 --> 29:17.755
they got away with
pretty decent names.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.523
One's Stewart the
other one's Jeff.

29:19.524 --> 29:21.291
- I see, so when you were born

29:21.292 --> 29:22.793
Kookie was the only name left?

29:22.794 --> 29:24.995
- Yeah, apparently, apparently.

29:24.996 --> 29:27.131
- I find that very
hard to believe.

29:27.132 --> 29:29.099
- What are you gonna do?

29:29.100 --> 29:32.803
- Kookie Packard, old
Hollywood royalty.

29:32.804 --> 29:34.004
- That's me.

29:34.005 --> 29:35.272
- So, Prince Charming,
when is this thing

29:35.273 --> 29:39.409
- Oh, just a few more minutes
here my little leopard.

29:39.410 --> 29:41.312
- I'm not in any rush.

29:42.213 --> 29:43.480
- Good to know.

29:43.481 --> 29:45.816
Scenic route it is.

29:45.817 --> 29:47.018
And I'm driving.

29:51.523 --> 29:54.124
- I don't know what the hell
you want me to do here, Art.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.359
Lenny made it pretty clear

29:55.360 --> 29:57.227
he doesn't want me
on his case, so.

29:57.228 --> 29:59.496
- Is that what he
said before or after

29:59.497 --> 30:01.933
you knocked his tooth out.

30:03.301 --> 30:04.568
- Uh, before.

30:04.569 --> 30:06.503
- I don't care what the beef

30:06.504 --> 30:08.505
between the two of you is.

30:08.506 --> 30:10.941
We got a guy who
killed a hooker.

30:12.177 --> 30:14.311
And for all we know
he'll do it again.

30:14.312 --> 30:15.579
And again, and again, and a...

30:15.580 --> 30:16.948
- I gotta go.

30:22.187 --> 30:23.922
- Can you zip me up.

30:24.989 --> 30:26.256
- Yeah.

30:26.257 --> 30:29.059
She messes with my head
pulling stuff like this.

30:29.060 --> 30:30.594
She knows it kills me.

30:30.595 --> 30:32.864
Just start charging you.

30:38.069 --> 30:38.903
Business?

30:38.904 --> 30:40.238
- It always is.

30:43.074 --> 30:44.976
- Hey, hey, come here.

30:46.377 --> 30:47.544
Be careful.

30:47.545 --> 30:49.479
I'm serious, Eve.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.014
Is out there on the
streets, okay.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.517
- Like you.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.195
- Yeah, like me.

31:06.898 --> 31:08.565
- Animal rights activists
have been pushing

31:08.566 --> 31:10.601
for the bill for nine
years and have taken part

31:10.602 --> 31:14.605
in mass demonstrations
throughout the nation.

31:14.606 --> 31:16.374
- No fuckin' way.

31:24.148 --> 31:25.148
Oh fuck.

31:38.663 --> 31:41.465
- So, this is my casa.

31:41.466 --> 31:43.934
- Hey wait a second,

31:43.935 --> 31:45.636
did they use this on
the Rockford Files?

31:45.637 --> 31:47.170
- Wow do you have a sharp eye.

31:47.171 --> 31:48.139
- It's unbelievable.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.274
- Season two.

31:54.679 --> 31:57.915
What do you say to a night cap Mr.
Kookie Packard?

31:57.916 --> 32:00.018
- Twist my arm.

32:05.990 --> 32:08.993
Something about
this is too easy.

32:09.694 --> 32:12.930
Either that or I'm
just that damn good.

32:12.931 --> 32:17.567
- Should have
called for back up.

32:17.568 --> 32:20.938
I don't know why I give a
damn about this chick.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.507
Everything about Eve
and I is a lie.

32:23.508 --> 32:25.442
But I just can't help it.

32:25.443 --> 32:27.377
- Anybody have eyes
on a brown Challenger

32:27.378 --> 32:28.446
downtown LA.

32:31.683 --> 32:34.318
- We got a late model
Dodge Challenger, brown,

32:34.319 --> 32:37.988
Lincoln Motel, 1705
Royal Boulevard.

32:37.989 --> 32:40.457
- There's just
something about her.

32:40.458 --> 32:43.393
It's like she's just
as lost as I am.

32:43.394 --> 32:45.028
You're in too deep Mickey.

32:45.029 --> 32:46.130
Too deep.

33:02.313 --> 33:03.447
- What the fuck, man?

33:03.448 --> 33:07.150
Who are you, her
boyfriend or something?

33:07.151 --> 33:08.685
- Yeah, something like that.

33:08.686 --> 33:11.589
Put your arm on
that fuckin' pipe.

33:13.491 --> 33:15.092
- This is bullshit, man.

33:15.093 --> 33:16.626
- Yeah.
- You got nothing on me.

33:16.627 --> 33:18.996
- Beatin' girls to a
pulp ain't nothing.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.330
Don't fuckin' move.

33:20.331 --> 33:22.032
- She's here on her own terms.

33:22.033 --> 33:23.767
- Doesn't look like
her own terms to me.

33:23.768 --> 33:25.003
Come on, baby.

33:26.437 --> 33:28.740
- You should just go, Mick.

33:29.640 --> 33:30.640
- What?

33:34.545 --> 33:36.680
There's a guy out there
killing girls with that car,

33:36.681 --> 33:38.048
you know anything about it?

33:38.049 --> 33:40.083
- Look at me Mick,
don't, he's a regular.

33:40.084 --> 33:41.318
- Listen to her.

33:41.319 --> 33:43.687
- He's a regular,
not a murderer.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.722
What the fuck are you doing?

33:45.723 --> 33:48.725
- Good money so this
shit doesn't happen.

33:48.726 --> 33:49.560
- Eve.

33:49.560 --> 33:50.560
- Go.

33:52.730 --> 33:54.131
My God.

33:54.132 --> 33:57.368
- The cuffs, before
I call my lawyer.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.337
- You're second base
for the Dodgers, huh?

34:00.338 --> 34:02.072
- Yeah, that's right.

34:02.073 --> 34:05.676
Whatever you want
to these girls?

34:06.778 --> 34:07.712
Tabloids are gonna love this.

34:07.713 --> 34:09.346
- Shit man, this is private.

34:09.347 --> 34:10.614
- Not anymore.

34:10.614 --> 34:12.081
- God dammit, look I'll...

34:12.083 --> 34:14.451
- I'll give you money,
is that what you want,

34:14.452 --> 34:16.353
is that what you're
looking for, huh buddy?

34:16.353 --> 34:18.355
Name your price.

34:18.356 --> 34:19.822
- I like that car out there.
- You're a fucking idiot.

34:19.824 --> 34:22.726
- Yeah, if you like it,
take it, it's yours.

34:22.726 --> 34:24.161
- What else you got?

34:24.161 --> 34:26.696
Stop fuckin' taking
pictures man.

34:26.697 --> 34:28.766
Keys are there, take it.

34:30.168 --> 34:34.138
There's a bat in the back
if you want me to sign it.

34:35.505 --> 34:37.108
- You all right?

34:54.192 --> 34:56.159
You okay to drive home?

34:58.729 --> 35:00.164
- I always am.

35:10.241 --> 35:12.742
- She acts so damn tough.

35:12.743 --> 35:14.412
I think I love her.

35:15.680 --> 35:19.283
Almost forgot about
my new little buddy.

35:20.518 --> 35:21.519
No back up.

35:22.587 --> 35:24.489
I'm not a cop tonight.

35:25.389 --> 35:27.291
He roughed up my girl.

35:28.659 --> 35:32.296
And sometimes people just
need a fuckin' beatin'.

35:40.304 --> 35:41.304
- Oh, whoo.

35:43.174 --> 35:46.243
- Boy, there's nothing
like vinyl, huh?

35:46.244 --> 35:48.278
- I like you more and
more by the second.

35:48.279 --> 35:49.813
Come on over here.

35:49.814 --> 35:52.849
- I can't believe you have this.

35:52.850 --> 35:55.619
♪ Everybody's talkin' 'bout me

35:55.620 --> 35:57.354
♪ Can't wait to say

35:57.355 --> 35:59.189
- I love that song.

35:59.190 --> 36:00.258
- Ah, uh-oh.

36:03.895 --> 36:06.496
Looks like someone could use
a refill on her drinky-poo.

36:06.497 --> 36:08.331
- Well thank you.

36:08.332 --> 36:10.267
- Your nose you have.

36:10.268 --> 36:12.470
- Just get on back here now.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.685
- Here you go my little leopard.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.321
- Such a gentleman.

36:37.528 --> 36:39.763
- You know what, here's
to Shirley Summers.

36:39.764 --> 36:41.566
- Oh, that old thing?

36:42.600 --> 36:45.268
- May she rest in peace.

36:45.269 --> 36:46.370
Fuck her.

36:52.476 --> 36:53.476
- Whoo.

36:56.981 --> 36:59.217
- Well look at you.

37:27.278 --> 37:29.512
Normally I'd make myself a
peanut butter sandwich.

37:29.513 --> 37:31.248
It's just my thing.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.351
But I'm in a bit of a rush.

37:39.357 --> 37:41.659
Well ain't this my lucky day?

37:47.265 --> 37:48.598
Sweet dreams, honey.

37:48.599 --> 37:51.902
Thanks for the phone,
and the earrings.

37:53.304 --> 37:54.805
And the necklace.

39:07.445 --> 39:11.449
- Fuckin' Kook, gonna
get both of us pinched.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.485
I hope you left
this place clean.

39:15.486 --> 39:17.555
God dammit, I'm nervous.

39:19.090 --> 39:22.625
Should have taken that
extra swig in the car.

39:22.626 --> 39:24.094
Am I gonna have to request
the report from Art,

39:24.095 --> 39:26.497
or are you gonna fill me in?

39:28.899 --> 39:31.635
She's my suspect, Rick, come on.

39:33.604 --> 39:36.005
- 'Cause of death, gunshot
wound to the head.

39:36.006 --> 39:36.941
- Yeah.

39:36.942 --> 39:38.908
- Projectile is being looked at.

39:38.909 --> 39:40.978
No sign of forced entry.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.080
- You have anything useful,
you have surveillance,

39:44.081 --> 39:46.517
you talk to the neighbors?

39:47.118 --> 39:51.622
But we'll sure as
fuck find something.

39:54.458 --> 39:57.628
This ain't good.

39:58.696 --> 40:02.566
- What's the matter, too
much blood for you?

40:05.002 --> 40:07.671
- How's your face doing, Lenny?

40:43.874 --> 40:44.874
- Hungry.

40:45.943 --> 40:49.012
I could eat the ass
out of a horse.

40:49.013 --> 40:51.015
That's how hungry I am.

41:01.759 --> 41:03.160
Really starving.

41:06.464 --> 41:09.867
- Ah, well look what
the cat dragged in.

41:12.002 --> 41:14.071
- Madison's my daughter.

41:15.539 --> 41:17.907
- Well she's my daughter too.

41:17.908 --> 41:19.509
- You can't just
walk into her school

41:19.510 --> 41:21.911
and pretend to be Stewart.

41:21.912 --> 41:24.514
You're not her father there.

41:24.515 --> 41:26.983
Jeez, what is wrong with you?

41:26.984 --> 41:28.818
- What's wrong with me?

41:28.819 --> 41:31.254
Hey I'm not the one living
in white picket fence land

41:31.255 --> 41:32.722
pretending to be
something I'm not.

41:32.723 --> 41:33.957
- That is different.

41:33.958 --> 41:36.627
- How the fuck is
that different?

41:39.530 --> 41:42.999
- Because I have to do what
is right for my child.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.803
And nothing is
gonna change that.

41:46.670 --> 41:47.771
Not this, and not you.

41:52.176 --> 41:55.111
Sign this and get it back to me.

41:55.112 --> 41:59.016
Stewart is her father,
and I want it on paper.

42:03.921 --> 42:05.689
Get it back to me.

42:23.741 --> 42:25.208
- God.

42:25.209 --> 42:26.209
- Ruby?

42:28.279 --> 42:29.213
He's right.

42:29.214 --> 42:31.549
No more games, it's time.

42:33.083 --> 42:34.784
- Why do you keep saying
it's time, it's time.

42:34.785 --> 42:36.020
Time for what?

42:37.154 --> 42:38.154
Huh?

42:42.192 --> 42:44.561
- Time to go to paradise.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.596
I'm here to take you there.

42:46.597 --> 42:47.764
Don't you worry.

42:47.765 --> 42:49.566
Well that backfired.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.701
Sometimes I actually
forget I have a heart

42:51.702 --> 42:55.105
and that I just want
to see my daughter.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.977
God she's hot when she's pissed.

43:01.812 --> 43:03.680
- Hey.

43:03.681 --> 43:06.182
Hey, oh yeah you're mad now.

43:06.183 --> 43:10.353
You know what, you had your
chance, and you blew it.

43:10.354 --> 43:11.655
Yeah.

43:17.861 --> 43:19.697
Yeah, ooh you're mad.

43:43.120 --> 43:44.120
- Kook.

43:45.823 --> 43:46.823
Kook.

43:48.659 --> 43:49.760
Sober up.

43:53.397 --> 43:57.668
24 hours away from becoming
a suspect to murder.

44:04.808 --> 44:06.643
- What?

44:06.644 --> 44:10.748
After finishing off
a fifth of Bourbon.

44:19.089 --> 44:20.323
- You awake yet?

44:20.324 --> 44:21.324
- Yeah.

44:26.664 --> 44:29.666
- She's dead, Kook.

44:29.667 --> 44:30.867
- Who's dead?

44:30.868 --> 44:32.301
- Donna Lang.

44:32.302 --> 44:33.303
She's dead.

44:39.810 --> 44:42.379
- What do you mean she's dead?

44:43.747 --> 44:44.947
- Police report said
somebody took her out

44:44.948 --> 44:46.783
five minutes after you
told me you left.

44:46.784 --> 44:49.385
- Yeah, I, I went and
got her a drink, I only

44:49.386 --> 44:52.321
It certainly wasn't
enough to kill her.

44:52.322 --> 44:54.123
You don't think I had anything
to do with it, do you?

44:54.124 --> 44:55.291
- Did you?

44:55.292 --> 44:56.292
- No.

44:58.095 --> 44:59.796
- Look it's off.

44:59.797 --> 45:01.764
- No, man, man you can't call
it off, it's not that easy.

45:01.765 --> 45:04.000
- The only thing
the LAPD can find

45:04.001 --> 45:07.303
are traces of the actual
scumbag who did it.

45:07.304 --> 45:09.338
None of this touches us, man.

45:09.339 --> 45:10.873
- I got plenty of reasons
to pull this thing through,

45:10.874 --> 45:12.108
more than you.

45:12.109 --> 45:13.309
It's off.

45:13.310 --> 45:14.711
- Let me show you something.

45:14.712 --> 45:17.413
- We're done, we're walking.

45:17.414 --> 45:19.782
- Donna's ringer.

45:19.783 --> 45:20.817
- Is that the
victim's cell phone?

45:20.818 --> 45:21.984
- Yeah.
- I should.

45:21.985 --> 45:23.453
- Hey!
- Are you out of your mind?

45:23.454 --> 45:25.021
- No, would you fuckin' relax,
they got nothing to trace.

45:25.022 --> 45:26.255
- That's the first
thing you trace.

45:26.256 --> 45:27.890
- It's her secondary, and
unless you told them

45:27.891 --> 45:29.726
she's got a separate
Armenian drug line,

45:29.727 --> 45:34.430
they got nothing to trace,
would you fuckin' relax.

45:34.431 --> 45:36.766
Let me show you something.

45:36.767 --> 45:39.769
Come to my party tomorrow.

45:39.770 --> 45:41.772
Ball drops at 11 p.m.

45:42.740 --> 45:44.174
1625 Lymone Avenue.

45:45.776 --> 45:48.211
You know who wrote
that, Winkler Junior.

45:48.212 --> 45:51.514
We just got the info for the
drop that's going down.

45:51.515 --> 45:54.384
And I'm going, fuck am I going.

45:59.423 --> 46:01.257
With or without you.

46:01.258 --> 46:02.925
In case you were
wondering, this is normal.

46:02.926 --> 46:05.394
We argue like brother
and sister, folks.

46:05.395 --> 46:07.263
He's the sister.

46:07.264 --> 46:08.998
It always ends well though.

46:08.999 --> 46:11.100
- If you would just
listen to me, and

46:11.101 --> 46:12.835
fuck it, where's the whiskey?

46:12.836 --> 46:14.403
- You know where it is.

46:14.404 --> 46:16.005
Told you.

46:16.006 --> 46:17.907
And now it's game time.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.127
- Hi.
- Hello there.

47:11.128 --> 47:12.328
- Would you care for a
glass of champagne?

47:12.329 --> 47:13.563
- I'd be delighted.

47:13.564 --> 47:14.897
- I'm Layla, if you need
anything let me know.

47:14.898 --> 47:16.199
- All right Layla.
- Okay.

47:16.200 --> 47:17.167
Enjoy yourself.

47:17.167 --> 47:18.101
- I'll do that.

47:18.102 --> 47:19.837
Daddy must be proud.

47:33.884 --> 47:34.985
- Hello.

47:36.553 --> 47:37.454
- How you doin'?

47:37.455 --> 47:39.322
- I'm good.

47:39.323 --> 47:41.458
- Shouldn't you be
having a good time?

47:45.329 --> 47:47.965
- I know a lie when I hear one.

47:51.368 --> 47:55.505
You gotta say, this is one
hell of a ballsy move.

47:58.108 --> 47:59.909
Look at this guy.

47:59.910 --> 48:03.413
You have no idea what's
coming, douchebag.

48:04.481 --> 48:07.484
You're gonna buy me
a new Winnebago.

48:08.552 --> 48:11.588
Pardon me would you,
for one second.

48:20.931 --> 48:22.965
And the lion is out of the cage.

48:22.966 --> 48:26.969
Oh man, to be a fly on the
wall when this shit goes down.

48:26.970 --> 48:28.272
Good luck, pal.

49:00.037 --> 49:01.938
Hey, cheers, huh?

49:01.939 --> 49:03.473
- Cheers.

49:37.107 --> 49:38.607
- Art, it's me.

49:38.608 --> 49:40.543
That bust I promised you.

49:40.544 --> 49:43.112
It's happening right now,
I need back up ASAP.

49:43.113 --> 49:44.748
1625 Lymone Avenue.

49:47.017 --> 49:48.584
You got me?

49:48.585 --> 49:49.585
All right.

50:00.664 --> 50:01.664
- Ah-hah.

50:03.333 --> 50:05.034
Sweet.

50:05.035 --> 50:07.603
- LAPD, don't move, don't move.

50:07.604 --> 50:09.171
You're under arrest for trafficking
controlled substances.

50:09.172 --> 50:13.275
Put your pieces on the
floor by me slow, slow.

50:13.276 --> 50:14.144
- That's rich.

50:14.145 --> 50:15.411
- Turn around.

50:15.412 --> 50:16.545
Both of you turn around.

50:16.546 --> 50:17.381
- Under arrest.

50:17.382 --> 50:18.581
- Get on your knees.

50:18.582 --> 50:19.782
Get on your fucking
knees right now.

50:19.783 --> 50:21.550
Get on your fuckin' knees.

50:21.551 --> 50:25.756
Put your arms behind your back.

50:29.760 --> 50:32.561
Try your friend and I'll
break your fuckin' face.

50:32.562 --> 50:35.631
Don't you move,
you fuckin' move.

50:35.632 --> 50:37.199
Put your hands behind your back.

50:37.200 --> 50:39.168
Put your hands behind
your fuckin' back.

50:39.169 --> 50:42.738
- Tell you something man, I'm
the fuckin' mayor's kid.

50:42.739 --> 50:45.074
And I will kill you.

50:45.075 --> 50:47.076
- You're gonna get it pig.

50:47.077 --> 50:48.345
Shut the fuck up.

50:50.147 --> 50:51.214
- All right.

50:53.750 --> 50:56.052
You better fuckin'
find that guy.

50:56.053 --> 50:57.620
I'm not fuckin' around.

50:57.621 --> 50:59.088
And get rid of his
ass, all right.

50:59.089 --> 51:00.089
- I got it.

51:46.704 --> 51:48.704
- Nobody moves, nobody dies.

51:48.705 --> 51:49.773
- Holy shit.

51:51.108 --> 51:53.576
Where the fuck is
it coming from.

51:53.577 --> 51:55.479
Shut the fuck up, man.

51:56.646 --> 51:58.215
- Go.

52:20.237 --> 52:21.638
- Fuck.

52:58.808 --> 53:00.242
- Sometimes you feel
like you're on top

53:00.243 --> 53:04.813
Like you can handle anything
that's thrown at you.

53:04.814 --> 53:07.249
I feel good tonight.

53:07.250 --> 53:08.250
We did it.

53:19.396 --> 53:21.398
What the hell happened?

53:24.234 --> 53:25.335
- Well,

53:26.836 --> 53:28.637
someone who was not our
back up just shot up

53:28.638 --> 53:32.275
our fuckin' show pal,
that's what happened.

53:33.643 --> 53:35.511
Let me get a smoke.

53:35.512 --> 53:37.213
- Yeah.

53:37.214 --> 53:41.251
- Dropped mine jumping
out of a fuckin' window.

53:44.955 --> 53:47.723
- Well I take back
everything I just said.

53:47.724 --> 53:51.227
Just like that I knew our
borrowed time was up.

53:51.228 --> 53:52.461
We planned for this.

53:52.462 --> 53:55.965
Party was gonna end
sooner or later.

53:55.966 --> 53:58.801
Mick was right,
we're in too deep,

53:58.802 --> 53:59.802
too close.

54:00.537 --> 54:03.439
Time to hit the road, Jack.

54:03.440 --> 54:06.308
- I'm gonna play this bust
tomorrow like I said.

54:06.309 --> 54:08.310
Pal, I'm trying to find every
angle to keep you clear here.

54:08.311 --> 54:09.712
- Yeah, yeah.

54:09.713 --> 54:11.280
- But I don't know.

54:11.281 --> 54:12.549
- It's all right.

54:15.719 --> 54:18.321
I guess it's that time, huh?

54:23.026 --> 54:24.327
I got your cut.

54:29.866 --> 54:32.669
- Little heavier
than usual, huh?

54:36.906 --> 54:37.906
- Hey.

54:41.544 --> 54:44.513
I'll see you in my
nightmares, huh?

54:44.514 --> 54:45.682
- You got it.

54:52.489 --> 54:54.556
- Hey Mick.

54:54.557 --> 54:55.557
- Yeah.

54:57.761 --> 54:59.896
- Was it worth it?

55:11.408 --> 55:14.878
Take it easy, partner.

55:22.319 --> 55:25.055
- You know why Mickey does this?

55:35.365 --> 55:38.567
A while back he was undercover.

55:38.568 --> 55:40.403
Deep cover, actually.

55:42.072 --> 55:45.741
So lo and behold there was
an exchange of gunfire

55:45.742 --> 55:49.912
with some thugs, and
bullets were flying.

55:49.913 --> 55:52.749
Mickey decides to
empty his clip.

55:54.517 --> 55:56.018
Hits a kid.

55:56.019 --> 55:59.455
Bullet lodges in the
base of the spine.

55:59.456 --> 56:01.524
Kid doesn't walk anymore.

56:02.859 --> 56:04.993
Mom's on welfare

56:04.994 --> 56:06.730
and up 'til this day

56:08.031 --> 56:12.101
she never made one payment
towards those bills.

56:12.102 --> 56:14.002
- Sounds like he's
an admirable guy.

56:14.003 --> 56:15.771
- Who shot a kid and
covered it up, man.

56:15.772 --> 56:17.406
- At least he tried to
do the right thing.

56:17.407 --> 56:19.509
What are you gonna do?

56:21.111 --> 56:22.511
- Let me tell you
something, Kookie

56:22.512 --> 56:25.548
Mickey's gone rogue,
you understand?

56:26.750 --> 56:29.985
And he's a bigger
con than you are.

56:29.986 --> 56:32.688
So I'm gonna make
it real clear, man.

56:32.689 --> 56:37.393
You don't help me with this,
you're gonna be a lone wolf

56:37.394 --> 56:41.531
in a big cage full of lions
for a very long time.

56:58.848 --> 57:01.016
These goons.

57:01.017 --> 57:03.118
They act like detectives, but
they've got one foot out

57:03.119 --> 57:05.521
just like everybody else.

57:05.522 --> 57:09.124
I don't put anything past
these pieces of shit.

57:09.125 --> 57:12.528
Just play it cool, Mick, relax.

57:12.529 --> 57:14.797
- Armenians plan
a big trade off,

57:14.798 --> 57:17.633
Latinos crash the
party, simple as that.

57:17.634 --> 57:20.636
Sending a message to steer
clear of their territory.

57:20.637 --> 57:21.837
I mean, it was only
a matter of time

57:21.838 --> 57:24.139
before the rich part
of town got hit.

57:24.140 --> 57:28.210
- Shane, that was anything
but a God damn gang hit.

57:28.211 --> 57:30.512
Crew concealing their faces
doesn't send a message.

57:30.513 --> 57:32.981
You got to show face to show
what color you're repping.

57:32.982 --> 57:34.450
If that was a gang
hit, why wasn't there

57:34.451 --> 57:35.951
two dead Armenians
in that house.

57:35.952 --> 57:37.786
- Could have been kidnapped
for all we know.

57:37.787 --> 57:39.455
- No, no.

57:39.456 --> 57:41.223
The gang woulda popped
them right then and there.

57:41.224 --> 57:43.792
- Look, I'll give you
that, but the rest?

57:43.793 --> 57:45.561
- You know what Rick,
it just doesn't add up.

57:45.562 --> 57:48.130
We're talking Kevlar
vests, shooting to kill,

57:48.131 --> 57:51.133
semi-automatic weapons, and now
the mayor's son is missing.

57:51.134 --> 57:52.968
It could have been his own
cavalry for all I know.

57:52.969 --> 57:53.969
- Whoa.

57:56.206 --> 57:59.476
Now I need you to
take it slow here.

58:00.643 --> 58:05.013
And no information about
Winkler's involvement

58:05.014 --> 58:06.483
leaves this room.

58:08.218 --> 58:11.955
That's political suicide
for the department.

58:14.023 --> 58:15.091
- Fine then.

58:16.693 --> 58:18.594
I got an idea, why
don't we talk about

58:18.595 --> 58:20.896
where my God damn back up was.

58:20.897 --> 58:23.065
That's actual suicide
for your department.

58:23.066 --> 58:24.533
- You know what?

58:24.534 --> 58:26.768
You need to go get
your head straight.

58:26.769 --> 58:30.073
I'm putting Rick and
Lenny on the case.

58:39.215 --> 58:40.816
Oh, we're done here.

58:40.817 --> 58:41.817
For now.

58:46.055 --> 58:47.055
- You think that's
enough to keep him

58:47.056 --> 58:49.592
from looking into the case?

58:59.903 --> 59:01.136
- Trailer's gassed
up at all times

59:01.137 --> 59:02.704
and ready for the desert.

59:02.705 --> 59:04.640
Gotta lay low for a bit.

59:04.641 --> 59:05.974
Cash is safely tucked away,

59:05.975 --> 59:07.309
and I'm outta here
as squeaky clean

59:07.310 --> 59:09.646
as I came into the world.

59:12.549 --> 59:15.685
- LAPD step out of
the fuckin' truck.

59:17.654 --> 59:19.856
- Oh, fuck.

59:37.140 --> 59:38.140
- Daniels.

59:39.642 --> 59:40.642
Yeah what.

59:42.579 --> 59:43.712
What?

59:43.713 --> 59:46.348
Oh come on man,
you're kidding me.

59:46.349 --> 59:49.251
These guys are gonna blow
the whole fuckin' thing.

59:49.252 --> 59:51.620
No wait, you listen
to me, listen to me.

59:51.621 --> 59:54.323
Okay, you call the chief, you
get over there right now.

59:54.324 --> 59:56.658
Do me a favor,
nobody goes in there

59:56.659 --> 59:58.026
until I get there, you hear me?

59:58.027 --> 59:59.695
Nobody.

59:59.696 --> 01:00:02.698
You don't talk to him, no one
enters that fuckin' room.

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:04.267
Yeah, I'm serious.

01:00:07.837 --> 01:00:08.837
Yeah.

01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:15.744
Dalton's Autobody, we can
talk about that again.

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:16.745
Right?

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:19.616
That was a mess.

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:26.355
We all know how that
turned out, right?

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:29.725
Lot of time and little money.

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:33.929
Ah, okay maybe we could talk
about the gambling fiasco

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:36.766
that happened a few months ago.

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:40.203
It was a mess.

01:00:41.371 --> 01:00:44.940
Didn't turn out well
at all, did it Kook?

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:46.375
Yeah.

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:48.710
Tell you what,

01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:50.980
maybe we could talk about the

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:57.286
the Armenian coke bust.

01:01:01.724 --> 01:01:02.825
Connor Winkler?

01:01:05.128 --> 01:01:06.795
Uh-huh.

01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:11.034
Well we both know how that
one turned out too, right?

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:13.036
Look, Kookie.

01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:16.772
I don't need an admission
from you, okay,

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:18.807
I know who you are.

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:20.443
I know what you do.

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:22.712
And to be honest,

01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:28.717
well I've got kind of
a soft spot for you.

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:30.887
Why, because you're good.

01:01:33.756 --> 01:01:37.059
And I don't think you have bad
intentions like your partner.

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.796
- I've already told
you about 20 times.

01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:42.999
I don't have bad intentions.

01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:47.436
And I don't have a partner.

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:50.706
- Listen to me very
carefully, okay.

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:52.875
I've been building a case

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:56.812
on Mickey Rady for two years.

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:58.747
And at this point in time,

01:01:58.748 --> 01:02:00.782
you're gonna have
to make a choice.

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:02.350
Real simple.

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:04.986
Either you go away with him

01:02:04.987 --> 01:02:06.989
or you help me get him.

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:11.194
It's that simple.

01:02:31.514 --> 01:02:34.150
- Can I get that cup of coffee?

01:02:37.854 --> 01:02:39.422
- Cream and sugar?

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:42.424
- Yeah.

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:59.141
- Hey could someone grab
me a coffee, please.

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:00.510
Cream and sugar.

01:03:23.432 --> 01:03:24.432
- Ah, man.

01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:03.305
- Packard.

01:04:04.473 --> 01:04:07.476
You got the phone
for five minutes.

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:41.142
- Hey it's me, leave a message.

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:44.981
- Well, I ain't calling
you from you Miami.

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:50.986
Let's just suppose what
you mentioned is right.

01:04:50.987 --> 01:04:53.455
Somebody takes out
Donna after I leave.

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:57.126
I mean, somebody could
have seen me, right?

01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:00.196
A party gets shot up,

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:03.565
and then this morning I take
a pinch from LA's finest

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:06.134
as a suspect to murder, so
I think it's safe to say

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:09.204
we pissed in somebody's
pool there, pal.

01:05:09.205 --> 01:05:10.639
And I also think
it's safe to say

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.976
they're probably
coming after you next.

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:18.246
So why don't you think
about bailing me out

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:20.082
as soon as you can.

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:26.088
There's a shit
storm coming, pal.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:30.258
- As you know, we've been
covering the recent developments

01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:32.994
within the Los Angeles
police department.

01:05:32.995 --> 01:05:35.630
Budget cuts and related
restructuring.

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:39.334
Increasing crimes rates, in
particular gang violence

01:05:39.335 --> 01:05:41.303
and drug related crimes.

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:45.140
We asked Mayor Winkler for a
comment, but without success.

01:05:45.141 --> 01:05:49.277
Now, after the Lymone
shooting, yet another tragedy

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:53.381
involving two innocent
fatalities, both Latino men,

01:05:53.382 --> 01:05:54.684
ages 24 and 22.

01:05:57.053 --> 01:05:59.054
From what we know at this point,

01:05:59.055 --> 01:06:01.022
the shooting was gang related,

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:04.359
likely triggered by a
drug deal gone bad.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:09.364
Rival gangs seem to be
battling it out for territory.

01:06:09.365 --> 01:06:12.968
Drug trafficking, we've seen
this before in MacArthur Park

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:17.206
where several gangs fought
over turf in the mid '90s.

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:50.472
- Hey.

01:06:55.711 --> 01:06:56.711
What?

01:07:14.463 --> 01:07:15.497
You okay, babe?

01:07:15.498 --> 01:07:16.399
- No.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:20.268
I was just getting the
girls in the van.

01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:22.137
And then they rolled up

01:07:22.138 --> 01:07:25.173
and then they just
started shooting at us.

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:29.412
They shot at us, Mickey, they
could have shot our girls.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.175
I got you Rady.

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:01.343
