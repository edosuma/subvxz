WEBVTT

00:01.182 --> 00:02.626
<i>Previously on Fringe...</i>

00:02.661 --> 00:04.320
When you asked me
to come back to this world

00:04.404 --> 00:06.322
- with you, you said...
- That you belonged with me.

00:06.390 --> 00:08.391
And so I came back for you.

00:08.492 --> 00:09.909
And we started
seeing each other.

00:09.993 --> 00:11.444
I thought she was you, Olivia.

00:14.114 --> 00:15.531
I'm sorry.

00:15.599 --> 00:17.616
Olivia was never treated
with Cortexiphan.

00:17.667 --> 00:19.118
I might have been.

00:19.202 --> 00:20.586
Walter, what did you do to us?

00:20.653 --> 00:24.190
We believed that
our world needed guardians.

00:24.257 --> 00:26.192
And that you children
would be those protectors.

00:26.259 --> 00:28.127
I'm sorry.

00:28.228 --> 00:30.546
- <i>The First People</i>.
- By Seamus Wiles.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.198
"They made
the ultimate discovery.

00:32.265 --> 00:34.533
"A mechanism containing
both the power

00:34.601 --> 00:36.469
to create and to destroy."

00:36.520 --> 00:37.853
This machine is dangerous.

00:37.921 --> 00:39.238
When we put the
word out that we were looking

00:39.339 --> 00:40.973
for copies of the book,
we found out

00:41.024 --> 00:42.041
we weren't the only ones.

00:42.109 --> 00:44.343
- Who?
- William Bell.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

01:19.146 --> 01:21.147
Hmm.

01:36.446 --> 01:38.114
Hmm.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.057
Hmm.

02:27.914 --> 02:30.749
<i>The First People</i>.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.918
You and your secrets.

02:41.928 --> 02:45.147
Yes, call Agent Dunham, please.

02:45.232 --> 02:47.082
So they all say
essentially the same thing.

02:47.150 --> 02:49.018
Not essentially.
Precisely.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.403
Despite being attributed
to different authors.

02:51.471 --> 02:54.273
A fantastical idea
and I have yet to uncover

02:54.324 --> 02:56.358
why William was pursuing it.

02:56.443 --> 02:57.860
That being said,

02:57.944 --> 02:59.161
it was information in the books

02:59.246 --> 03:00.829
that lead us directly
to the coordinates

03:00.914 --> 03:02.648
where we recovered
the pieces of the device.

03:02.699 --> 03:05.284
Which makes them impossible
discount.

03:07.587 --> 03:08.987
I've been thinking
about the journal

03:09.089 --> 03:11.457
the other Olivia wrote
while she was here.

03:11.508 --> 03:13.459
Perhaps her writing might
shed some light.

03:13.510 --> 03:15.844
Uh, no. I read her file
and she didn't mention

03:15.929 --> 03:17.379
<i>The First People</i> or the device.

03:17.464 --> 03:21.016
Oh, I hadn't realized.

03:21.101 --> 03:24.637
I... imagine that must
have been awkward,

03:24.688 --> 03:27.573
reading her account
of her time with Peter.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.692
Though it seems
somewhere along the way

03:29.776 --> 03:31.977
she did start to develop
genuine feelings for him.

03:32.028 --> 03:33.696
I see.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.397
And did that surprise you?

03:35.482 --> 03:37.399
No.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.368
I mean, I understand
how that could happen.

03:42.093 --> 03:43.236
But...

03:43.356 --> 03:45.457
But what?

03:45.525 --> 03:51.046
Just makes me wonder
if maybe he feels the me way.

03:51.131 --> 03:54.333
And I would understand if he did.

03:54.384 --> 03:59.138
I... I was her
for while and she's...

03:59.205 --> 04:02.591
She's like me, but better.

04:02.659 --> 04:03.875
Oh, Olivia...

04:03.927 --> 04:05.427
No, I mean,
she still has her mother

04:05.512 --> 04:08.880
and she wasn't
experimented on as a child.

04:08.932 --> 04:10.882
And she can laugh.
She has real friends.

04:10.934 --> 04:13.235
She even wears a dress
every once in a while.

04:13.270 --> 04:15.053
Yes, but even so,

04:15.105 --> 04:19.325
you don't know
what Peter's thinking.

04:19.392 --> 04:22.311
William and I...

04:22.395 --> 04:25.497
We also had
a complicated relationship.

04:25.565 --> 04:27.149
If there's one thing I regret,

04:27.217 --> 04:28.951
it's that we never
honestly acknowledged

04:29.002 --> 04:31.337
how we felt about each other.

04:31.404 --> 04:34.173
Don't make the same mistake
that I did.

04:34.257 --> 04:37.676
If you want to know
how Peter feels...

04:37.744 --> 04:39.745
Ask him.

04:44.801 --> 04:46.185
Ah.

04:46.252 --> 04:48.220
What is it?

04:48.271 --> 04:50.589
Ooh!

04:50.640 --> 04:52.107
Hey, now you can finally
get the real answers

04:52.192 --> 04:53.525
to the mysteries
of the universe, Warren.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.694
Yeah.

04:55.762 --> 05:01.317
Tell me, oh eight-ball,
will we get the Fowler Grant?

05:01.401 --> 05:04.286
Oh.
"Outlook not so good."

05:33.299 --> 05:35.901

- Oh, yeah, once a year.

06:54.312 --> 06:55.846
Ninety minutes ago,
911 received a call

06:55.897 --> 06:57.598
about a suspected
biological attack.

06:57.682 --> 06:59.733
BPD responded,
evac'ed the building

06:59.818 --> 07:01.435
and set up a quarantine zone.

07:01.519 --> 07:02.853
- Any casualties?
- One.

07:02.904 --> 07:04.521
Dr. Warren Blake.

07:04.572 --> 07:06.440
A scientist working in
the company's R&D department.

07:06.524 --> 07:08.192
The victim's reaction doesn't match

07:08.276 --> 07:09.994
any known biological
or chemical weapon.

07:10.061 --> 07:12.946
But why would anyone
kill a scientist?

07:13.031 --> 07:13.947
What did we ever do?

07:14.032 --> 07:15.699
Really?

07:28.213 --> 07:29.463
Oh, my.
Look at this.

07:32.417 --> 07:34.802
I feel nauseated.

07:34.886 --> 07:37.438
Yeah, this is pretty disgusting,
even by our standards.

07:37.522 --> 07:39.256
I'm not talking about the body.

07:39.307 --> 07:42.192
I fear I may have broken wind
inside my suit.

07:45.430 --> 07:47.698
Hmm, this is curious.

07:47.765 --> 07:51.485
It would appear there isn't
a single bone left in this man's body.

07:51.553 --> 07:55.322
This blue substance seems
to be the culprit.

07:55.407 --> 07:56.740
The victim must have inhaled it.

07:56.774 --> 07:59.009
Which cause his bones
to disintegrate?

07:59.077 --> 08:00.828
Ingenious.

08:00.912 --> 08:04.715
It destroyed bone matter
but was non-reactive

08:04.782 --> 08:06.633
with everything else.

08:06.718 --> 08:09.086
The work of a highly proficient
chemist, no doubt.

08:13.291 --> 08:15.059
I found the source.

08:15.126 --> 08:16.844
That's an odd delivery system.

08:21.066 --> 08:22.599
Bonus points
for the creepy factor, though.

08:22.650 --> 08:24.935
This was definitely personal.

08:24.986 --> 08:26.170
It was his birthday.

08:26.237 --> 08:28.822
The card says, "From Madison."

08:28.907 --> 08:30.274
So who's Madison?

08:30.325 --> 08:31.859
I don't know.

08:31.943 --> 08:33.577
This was sent to Blake,

08:33.660 --> 08:36.947
but there's no
return address on it.

08:36.998 --> 08:38.414
What are you thinking?

08:38.482 --> 08:40.768
That this is too big to go
a mail drop.

08:40.869 --> 08:42.619
Did miss something?

08:42.669 --> 08:44.588
Yeah, our first lead.

08:44.672 --> 08:47.257
Oh.

08:50.795 --> 08:52.162
Thank you.

08:52.213 --> 08:53.514
Broyles tracked the postal code.

08:53.598 --> 08:55.883
The package was sent from
Chelsea two days ago,

08:55.967 --> 08:58.936
so I'm just downloading the
post office security footage.

08:59.003 --> 09:00.170
Okay.

09:00.221 --> 09:02.839
Let's see if we can find our guy.

09:17.122 --> 09:18.739
"Dr. Warren Blake was noted

09:18.823 --> 09:20.491
"for his recent work
in vaccinating

09:20.542 --> 09:22.326
thousands of people
in underdeveloped countries."

09:22.377 --> 09:24.044
This guy cured diseases.

09:25.463 --> 09:26.797
He saved lives.

09:26.864 --> 09:28.332
How come all the creeps
go after the good guys?

09:28.399 --> 09:30.467
Oh, my.

09:30.535 --> 09:32.202
How many times
are you gonna test that?

09:32.253 --> 09:34.588
Or is is just a way for you
to break your diet?

09:34.672 --> 09:39.143
Do you think I enjoy
eating greasy fried food?

09:39.227 --> 09:41.145
You're right.

09:41.229 --> 09:44.398
But if I can figure out
exactly what this substance is,

09:44.482 --> 09:46.433
then we may be able to
determine where it comes from.

09:46.501 --> 09:49.019
Look.

09:49.070 --> 09:51.822
The molecules in the powder
bond with calcium,

09:51.889 --> 09:54.575
but they also pear
to be capsulized,

09:54.659 --> 09:58.028
which preserves the agent until
it's delivered into the host.

09:58.079 --> 10:00.080
And...

10:00.165 --> 10:01.148
What?

10:01.216 --> 10:03.066
Belly and I worked
on a similar technique

10:03.117 --> 10:05.252
in the '70s when
we were trying to find a way

10:05.336 --> 10:08.038
to vaccinate people
without their knowledge.

10:08.089 --> 10:09.673
We discontinued the project

10:09.757 --> 10:11.375
when Tricky Dicky tried
to use our research

10:11.426 --> 10:13.076
to develop biological weapons.

10:13.127 --> 10:15.262
You used to work
for President Nixon?

10:15.346 --> 10:16.463
It was uncomfortable.

10:16.548 --> 10:21.635
His wife...
kept coming on to me.

10:21.719 --> 10:24.754
Now, little lady,
let's see what makes you tick.

10:24.806 --> 10:26.523
Because if I'm right,

10:26.591 --> 10:32.362
This is not some
rogue's creation at all.

10:32.430 --> 10:33.947
Astrid...

10:34.032 --> 10:35.399
Could you run this for, please?

10:35.450 --> 10:36.700
You found the suspect?

10:36.767 --> 10:39.870
Good thing lunatics
still use the postal service.

10:39.937 --> 10:41.989
Well, that makes
two breakthroughs.

10:42.073 --> 10:44.992
I believe this military.

10:45.076 --> 10:47.327
- Ours, to be precise.
- U.S. Military?

10:47.412 --> 10:48.795
How could you suspect get his
hands on something like that?

10:48.880 --> 10:51.798
Because he's a former Marine.

10:51.883 --> 10:53.050
His name is Aaron Downey.

10:53.117 --> 10:55.469
He doesn't have a criminal record.
He has a military one.

10:55.537 --> 10:57.054
So he used his clearance
to get access to the powder.

10:57.121 --> 10:58.338
It's not likely.

10:58.406 --> 11:00.090
He's been out of the service
for four years.

11:00.141 --> 11:03.176
Okay, what's his last
known address?

11:03.261 --> 11:04.961
This is Dunham.

11:05.013 --> 11:07.147
I need a team in Quincy, now.

11:16.407 --> 11:17.407
Clear!

11:17.475 --> 11:18.609
No chem or bio agents.

11:18.660 --> 11:19.743
We're clear.

11:19.827 --> 11:21.995
No chem or bio!

11:23.781 --> 11:25.032
Go ahead.
Take the hall.

11:25.116 --> 11:27.034
Okay.

11:30.788 --> 11:32.122
Still hot.

11:32.173 --> 11:35.208
We just missed him.

11:35.293 --> 11:38.845
So how does a Marine
end up a terrorist?

11:38.930 --> 11:40.747
It says here that Downey's
service record was impeccable

11:40.848 --> 11:41.882
and then four years ago,

11:41.966 --> 11:43.684
he just abruptly resigned
his commission.

11:43.768 --> 11:45.769
Does it say what
he did after that?

11:45.803 --> 11:47.054
No.

11:47.138 --> 11:49.005
He was off the grid
for a couple of years.

11:49.057 --> 11:51.191
But when he did resurface,
he bought this house.

11:51.276 --> 11:54.194
- All cash.
- Interesting.

11:54.279 --> 11:59.900
So who is she?

11:59.984 --> 12:02.035
She was obviously
important to him.

12:02.103 --> 12:04.655
Maybe she knows where is.

12:07.959 --> 12:09.776
You okay?

12:09.877 --> 12:12.579
Do you still think about her?

12:12.664 --> 12:15.232
Excuse me?

12:15.300 --> 12:17.367
Well, you've bought me
a hundred cups of coffee

12:17.418 --> 12:19.169
and you know that I take it
black with one sugar,

12:19.220 --> 12:20.387
but this morning you
bought me one with milk,

12:20.471 --> 12:22.172
and I'm assuming
that that's the way

12:22.240 --> 12:26.126
the other Olivia likes hers.

12:30.181 --> 12:34.050
Yes.

12:34.102 --> 12:38.121
I think about her all the time.

12:38.189 --> 12:40.941
I think about how she used
my feelings for you

12:41.025 --> 12:42.242
to manipulate me.

12:42.327 --> 12:43.910
How she lied to me
and everybody else.

12:43.995 --> 12:47.814
No, before you knew
she wasn't me.

12:47.915 --> 12:50.200
She was fun, right?

12:50.268 --> 12:51.618
She had an easier smile.

12:51.703 --> 12:52.919
I mean, that's what you said.

12:53.037 --> 12:54.755
Olivia, I said that because
I wanted you to know

12:54.839 --> 12:58.175
that I noticed the differences.

12:58.242 --> 13:00.577
But I thought it was
because of me.

13:00.628 --> 13:02.813
Because of us.

13:02.880 --> 13:08.085
I thought that I was bringing
out a different side in you.

13:08.152 --> 13:12.639
But it was never because
I wanted to be with her more.

13:12.690 --> 13:14.574
Because I don't.

13:20.365 --> 13:25.485
I'm sorry about the coffee.

13:25.570 --> 13:26.620
Agent Dunham?

13:26.704 --> 13:28.088
They've got something downstairs.

13:30.775 --> 13:32.993
- Can you finish up here?
- Yeah.

13:37.665 --> 13:39.583
Military ordinance is serialized.

13:39.617 --> 13:41.334
And the serial numbers
have been filed down.

13:41.419 --> 13:43.820
They're stolen.

13:43.888 --> 13:47.674
So...
Where are the other three?

13:53.231 --> 13:54.931
He's here!

13:57.685 --> 13:59.102
Freeze!

13:59.187 --> 14:00.604
Freeze! FBI!

14:14.844 --> 14:16.500
Mr. Downey's been stabilized,

14:16.523 --> 14:18.160
but there's a fair bit of
swelling in the brain,

14:18.183 --> 14:22.938
and that's pushing down on the brain-stem,
effectively cutting off the blood supply.

14:22.989 --> 14:26.041
So what are the chances that
he'll regain consciousness?

14:26.109 --> 14:27.460
We just don't know.

14:27.544 --> 14:29.111
The brain damage is substantial.

14:29.162 --> 14:31.464
May I see his medical chart?

14:31.548 --> 14:35.968
- Sure.
- Thank you.

14:36.052 --> 14:37.619
If he does come out the coma,

14:37.671 --> 14:39.455
he won't be able
to talk or swallow

14:39.506 --> 14:41.557
or even breathe
without machine.

14:41.624 --> 14:44.927
Okay.
Thank you, Doctor.

14:44.978 --> 14:46.512
So much for interrogating him.

14:46.596 --> 14:48.097
Hmm.

14:48.148 --> 14:51.484
What is it, Walter?

14:51.568 --> 14:54.270
It says there's still neural
activity in the cerebrum.

14:54.321 --> 14:55.738
Low levels, but it's there.

14:55.805 --> 14:59.275
I may know a way
to question the suspect.

15:03.480 --> 15:06.949
But I'll need to go back to
the lab first to think about it.

15:07.033 --> 15:08.484
The woman in the photos
at Downey's house,

15:08.535 --> 15:10.319
it's his ex-wife.

15:10.370 --> 15:12.154
She agreed to come in
and talk to us.

15:12.255 --> 15:16.658
Walter,
we'll drop you off at the lab.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.762
This is Dr. Warren Blake.

15:19.829 --> 15:24.416
We found his body yesterday.

15:24.484 --> 15:29.171
Do you know him?

15:29.272 --> 15:32.107
Uh... He finally...

15:32.175 --> 15:36.011
He finally did it.

15:36.062 --> 15:39.848
He said he was going to kill him.

15:39.900 --> 15:41.350
I just never
took him seriously.

15:41.401 --> 15:44.670
I'm sorry.
What are you saying?

15:44.788 --> 15:51.210
Aaron... left the Marines to do
some private contractor work.

15:51.278 --> 15:53.179
The money was really good,

15:53.280 --> 15:56.015
but he had to be overseas
for a couple of years.

15:56.082 --> 16:02.505
When he got home,
we wanted to start a family.

16:02.589 --> 16:04.590
It was great at first.

16:04.674 --> 16:08.727
I mean, I got pregnant
and we bought a house.

16:08.812 --> 16:12.681
And then, um...

16:12.732 --> 16:17.520
Seven months
into the pregnancy...

16:17.571 --> 16:19.371
Our baby died.

16:19.439 --> 16:21.724
Oh, I'm so sorry.

16:21.825 --> 16:27.913
The doctor said that there was
something wrong with Aaron.

16:27.981 --> 16:33.419
Some DNA pathogen
that he passed on to our child.

16:33.453 --> 16:35.170
Aaron was convinced
that it had something

16:35.238 --> 16:37.172
to do with his time overseas.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.708
He kept talking about
a weapons project,

16:39.759 --> 16:43.245
that he must have been
exposed to something.

16:43.346 --> 16:47.716
Dr. Blake was the scientist
who oversaw it.

16:47.784 --> 16:52.521
Sara, did happen tell you
the name that project?

16:54.774 --> 16:57.109
No, Aaron never said.

16:57.193 --> 17:00.896
All he talked about was Dr. Blake.

17:00.947 --> 17:03.382
He blamed him for Maddy's death.

17:03.450 --> 17:06.986
Maddy?

17:07.069 --> 17:09.454
Madison.

17:09.556 --> 17:11.089
That was gonna
be our daughter's name.

17:11.156 --> 17:14.310
She died like all the others.

17:14.377 --> 17:16.862
What others?

17:16.930 --> 17:18.964
There were two other men
in Aaron's unit.

17:19.049 --> 17:20.465
He never told me their names,

17:20.500 --> 17:23.167
but their babies died
the same way.

17:23.252 --> 17:25.387
I'm sorry to ask you this,

17:25.488 --> 17:27.623
but how did your daughter die?

17:27.674 --> 17:31.293
They said it was some
kind of bone disease.

17:31.344 --> 17:35.197
It left her without a skeleton.

17:37.651 --> 17:39.151
So we have three
missing canisters

17:39.235 --> 17:41.070
and two men with a grudge.

17:41.137 --> 17:42.771
So you're thinking revenge, too?

17:42.822 --> 17:45.074
Well, he killed Blake
with his own weapon.

17:45.141 --> 17:47.026
I'm gonna call Broyles
and see if he can dig up

17:47.110 --> 17:48.527
some of Blake's
old research grants.

17:49.829 --> 17:51.146
If we can find out more
about this project,

17:51.197 --> 17:53.248
then maybe we can find
the names of the other two men.

17:53.316 --> 17:54.667
Hello?

17:54.751 --> 17:58.153
<i>Peter?
I need to be picked up.</i>

17:58.204 --> 18:00.005
Where are you calling me from,
Walter?

18:00.040 --> 18:02.708
Um, New Hampshire, I believe.

18:02.759 --> 18:06.895
<i>Mile marker 259 on the I-89.</i>

18:06.963 --> 18:09.715
Peter, bring your wallet.

18:09.799 --> 18:11.833
I haven't got any money
and I'm starving!

18:14.354 --> 18:16.939
Walter,
you still haven't told us.

18:16.973 --> 18:18.857
Where exactly
were you driving to?

18:18.942 --> 18:21.009
I didn't see
the gas light come on.

18:21.061 --> 18:23.178
That wasn't my question.

18:26.399 --> 18:28.984
In the Worcester Cortexiphan trials,

18:29.035 --> 18:30.352
there was a boy, Simon Phillips.

18:30.403 --> 18:32.354
He lives just up the road here.

18:32.405 --> 18:33.572
I believe he may be able
to help us.

18:33.657 --> 18:35.157
Help us how?

18:35.208 --> 18:36.692
Peter, don't spill it.

18:36.743 --> 18:38.694
The paint on the car
is very delicate.

18:38.745 --> 18:40.629
Broyles pulled all the names

18:40.697 --> 18:43.349
from the Worcester Cortexiphan
trials months ago

18:43.383 --> 18:45.033
and I don't remember
a Simon Phillips.

18:45.085 --> 18:47.970
Because he wasn't in the records.

18:48.037 --> 18:50.055
He didn't complete the program.

18:50.173 --> 18:55.010
Simon was beginning to develop
the ability to read minds.

18:55.061 --> 18:56.979
We hadn't intended it to happen.

18:57.063 --> 18:59.348
No of the other children
were affected in such a way.

18:59.399 --> 19:03.218
You threw him out of the trial,
didn't you, Walter?

19:03.269 --> 19:04.219
Because you knew
if he read your mind,

19:04.270 --> 19:05.404
he'd know your secret.

19:05.488 --> 19:09.224
That you'd taken me
from the other side.

19:09.275 --> 19:11.393
Well, whether or not
he completed the trial

19:11.444 --> 19:12.561
is inconsequential.

19:12.612 --> 19:13.895
He had the ability once.

19:13.947 --> 19:15.364
Well, how do you know
that he can still access it?

19:15.415 --> 19:17.366
It's probably dormant,

19:17.417 --> 19:20.369
but if I can somehow
reactivate Simon's ability,

19:20.420 --> 19:22.738
then we could use him to read
Downey's mind,

19:22.789 --> 19:24.873
find out where
the next attack's coming from.

19:24.924 --> 19:26.709
Oh, look!

19:26.760 --> 19:30.796
Punch buggy! Blue.

19:46.696 --> 19:49.598
I don't think this guy's
big on company.

19:49.649 --> 19:53.402
I'm guessing you didn't
call ahead.

19:58.124 --> 20:00.375
Mr. Phillips?

20:04.664 --> 20:06.665
Hello?

20:10.170 --> 20:11.119
Walter, you don't have
to be nervous.

20:11.171 --> 20:12.137
I don't even think he's home.

20:12.255 --> 20:13.839
I'm not nervous.

20:13.923 --> 20:15.758
It was a long car trip.

20:15.809 --> 20:18.126
Listen, I need to pee.

20:21.964 --> 20:24.483
How do we know
that he still lives here?

20:34.160 --> 20:37.496
Yes, I know who you are.

20:37.580 --> 20:39.081
No, I wouldn't call it
wonderful at all.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.205
Bacon, unicorns...

20:46.289 --> 20:49.341
Peter's birthday,
dash of cinnamon,

20:49.425 --> 20:51.627
Z-two equals z-one squared
plus c,

20:51.678 --> 20:52.761
Reiden Lake.

20:52.829 --> 20:55.631
What does that mean, huh?

20:55.682 --> 20:58.801
- What are you trying to do to me?
- Nothing.

20:58.852 --> 21:01.837
It just my mind
does that sometimes.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.607
You need to leave.

21:05.675 --> 21:07.008
Put your gun down.

21:10.814 --> 21:13.816
How come I can't hear you?

21:16.402 --> 21:18.987
Why can't I read you?

21:19.038 --> 21:21.189
She's another Cortexiphan subject.

21:21.241 --> 21:24.643
Sometimes you children are
immune to each other's abilities.

21:24.711 --> 21:27.412
<i>I know what it's like.</i>

21:37.590 --> 21:40.325
What's wrong with him?

21:40.393 --> 21:44.363
Every new thought
he reads is an added stressor.

21:44.430 --> 21:49.101
To cope, his brain pumps adrenaline
and cortisol into his system.

21:49.185 --> 21:56.441
Naturally, he experiences headaches,
nausea, accelerated heart rate.

21:56.492 --> 21:57.893
That's why he gets sick.

21:57.944 --> 22:02.731
How many more, Walter?

22:02.799 --> 22:06.101
How many more are gonna come
crawling out of the woodwork?

22:15.879 --> 22:17.596
Thanks.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.681
You're welcome.

22:35.281 --> 22:37.416
It's refreshing you know,

22:37.483 --> 22:41.820
not, uh... Not being able
to read your mind.

22:41.905 --> 22:44.172
It's the, um...

22:44.240 --> 22:46.408
It's the first real conversation
I've had in twenty years.

22:49.545 --> 22:51.914
So it started when
I was about ten.

22:51.981 --> 22:53.332
It was, uh, small at first.

22:53.416 --> 22:55.200
Just hearing other kids'
thoughts at school,

22:55.268 --> 23:00.121
but then it kept getting worse,
and now I can't control it.

23:00.223 --> 23:02.007
I can't turn it off.

23:02.091 --> 23:05.844
Whenever I get within fifty feet
of another person, it's like...

23:05.929 --> 23:09.848
Is that why you live here?

23:09.933 --> 23:14.086
Alone?

23:18.358 --> 23:22.361
It's the only place that's quiet.

23:22.428 --> 23:24.446
You know how it feels
to be burdened with something

23:24.480 --> 23:26.932
that makes it impossible for you
to relate to another person?

23:26.966 --> 23:31.486
That makes you feel completely
alone in the world?

23:33.756 --> 23:35.140
I can imagine.

23:40.880 --> 23:43.015
Simon, I know that dealing
with our capabilities

23:43.099 --> 23:46.568
can sometimes be difficult,
but...

23:46.636 --> 23:50.956
They can also help people.

23:56.612 --> 23:57.980
Look, I don't have to be able
to read your mind

23:58.031 --> 24:02.567
to know that you want something.

24:02.635 --> 24:05.070
What is it?

24:07.006 --> 24:09.157
We need you to help
with an investigation.

24:09.208 --> 24:10.459
We need you to read
a suspect's mind.

24:10.526 --> 24:11.660
No, I don't think so.

24:11.711 --> 24:13.361
Please, Simon,
come back to Boston with me.

24:13.413 --> 24:18.000
A city the size of Boston?
You got to be joking.

24:18.051 --> 24:19.918
All those thoughts,
they're like

24:20.003 --> 24:21.803
millions of needles in my brain.

24:21.871 --> 24:23.038
I'm sorry.

24:23.089 --> 24:24.205
There's gotta be another way.

24:24.307 --> 24:25.640
Look, I know what
I'm asking of you,

24:25.708 --> 24:27.092
but, Simon, I'm afraid that
if you don't help us,

24:27.209 --> 24:29.177
more people will die.

24:34.517 --> 24:37.052
Please.

24:40.239 --> 24:42.824
Can you believe Barry
pulling this on us last-minute?

24:42.892 --> 24:45.060
Emergency board meeting
at five o'clock?

24:45.111 --> 24:49.531
I've got dinner in the city in an hour.
The 93 is gonna be brutal.

24:49.582 --> 24:51.333
Is this a joke?

24:51.400 --> 24:54.069
"Happy birthday from Carla."

25:10.645 --> 25:13.063
All non-critical patients in the lobby!

25:13.148 --> 25:14.265
Take Mr. Johnson to the cafeteria.

25:14.349 --> 25:16.600
- We've got the beds set up there.
- Okay.

25:16.685 --> 25:19.270
Ahh, we are moving them
as quickly as we can.

25:19.354 --> 25:20.771
Thank you.

25:20.855 --> 25:22.773
Can I ask what this is for?

25:22.857 --> 25:26.277
We need a mind reader
to help us find a bomb.

25:49.601 --> 25:52.303
We should think of backup plan.

25:52.387 --> 25:55.422
You got any ideas?

26:43.855 --> 26:45.272
It's not working, is it?

26:45.306 --> 26:52.029
Maybe if you, uh...
ask him a question.

26:52.113 --> 26:55.416
Okay.

26:55.483 --> 26:57.368
Aaron, can you focus on
my voice?

26:57.402 --> 27:00.020
Can you hear me talking to you?

27:00.088 --> 27:01.588
<i>The doctor says there's</i>

27:01.656 --> 27:03.374
<i>something wrong with our baby.</i>

27:03.458 --> 27:05.376
<i>It's completely oxidized.</i>

27:13.435 --> 27:16.103
Aaron...

27:16.170 --> 27:18.138
Who are you working with?

27:18.189 --> 27:22.175
Who else was a part of the project?

27:29.901 --> 27:33.754
You okay?

27:33.822 --> 27:37.157
Get me a pen.

27:37.208 --> 27:40.127
Well, what about
the plate of vegetables?

27:40.194 --> 27:41.462
Let's just assume
for right now

27:41.529 --> 27:42.830
that the vegetables
are inconsequential.

27:42.914 --> 27:46.183
Was there any reference
in Downey's file to Maryann?

27:46.251 --> 27:48.152
No.

27:48.219 --> 27:49.803
Okay, what about Project Jellyfish?

27:49.871 --> 27:53.924
Jellyfish are one of few
creatures without any bones.

27:53.975 --> 27:56.310
The weapons program Blake
and Downey worked on.

27:56.377 --> 27:57.578
Yeah, that's got to be it.

27:59.898 --> 28:02.349
Broyles.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.318
He can barely function
around people.

28:04.385 --> 28:07.371
The Cortexiphan trials
ruined his life.

28:07.439 --> 28:09.656
He's broken.

28:09.724 --> 28:11.592
Olivia, I know
what you're thinking.

28:13.461 --> 28:16.180
You and he are nothing alike.

28:16.247 --> 28:17.948
There's been another attack.

28:17.999 --> 28:19.283
Same M.O.

28:19.367 --> 28:21.668
The powder killed three senior
executives at Canopy One.

28:21.703 --> 28:23.587
Canopy One the defense contractor?

28:23.671 --> 28:25.539
You think that's who's
funding the weapons project

28:25.607 --> 28:27.257
that Downey and the others
were working on?

28:27.342 --> 28:28.792
I don't know.
I'm gonna call Nina Sharp.

28:28.877 --> 28:31.578
She's had more experience with
the Defense Department than I have.

28:31.629 --> 28:33.213
Let me know if you two
turn anything up.

28:33.264 --> 28:35.265
Okay.

28:41.272 --> 28:44.090
- Hi.
- Did it help?

28:44.142 --> 28:45.275
We don't know yet.

28:45.360 --> 28:47.744
We're, uh...
We're hoping so.

28:47.812 --> 28:49.596
Who is she?

28:49.614 --> 28:52.098
You had drawings
of her in your cabin.

28:52.116 --> 28:57.437
She works at a coffee shop
by my house.

28:57.489 --> 29:00.407
What's she like?

29:00.458 --> 29:03.460
She's perfect.

29:10.218 --> 29:12.236
You haven't met her, have you?

29:12.303 --> 29:14.605
I see her sometimes
when I drive by.

29:14.722 --> 29:18.759
Is it because you think
it would be too painful?

29:18.810 --> 29:21.428
Look, even if she
pretended to be nice

29:21.479 --> 29:24.832
or to be my friend
or even flirted with me

29:24.899 --> 29:27.734
out of some kind of pity,

29:27.769 --> 29:29.253
I would know how she really feels.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.972
That I'm too much of a freak

29:32.023 --> 29:35.025
for her to even consider
being with.

29:35.109 --> 29:37.678
But...
But you don't know that.

29:37.745 --> 29:41.248
That's what you're afraid
is gonna happen.

29:41.282 --> 29:43.166
And so what if you find out that...

29:43.251 --> 29:44.985
That she's not interested,

29:45.036 --> 29:47.404
or that there's somebody
else on her mind,

29:47.472 --> 29:48.822
or that she doesn't love you.

29:48.873 --> 29:51.291
I mean, isn't it...

29:51.342 --> 29:53.343
Isn't it better to know?

29:53.378 --> 29:57.347
No one should know exactly
what someone else is thinking.

29:57.382 --> 30:01.618
Probably not, but I wouldn't mind
having that ability right now.

30:14.849 --> 30:17.284
Officially,
Project Jellyfish never existed.

30:17.351 --> 30:19.970
You brought me all the way
out here to tell me that?

30:20.038 --> 30:22.389
No.

30:22.457 --> 30:23.807
Send Agent Edwards in, please.

30:32.033 --> 30:34.985
I might have guessed
that this involved the CIA.

30:35.019 --> 30:39.172
It doesn't. But Nina asked me
to do some digging.

30:39.223 --> 30:42.993
And we both know what
what Nina Sharp wants, she gets.

30:48.566 --> 30:51.318
So. Jellyfish.

30:51.352 --> 30:53.386
It was a weapons project.

30:53.438 --> 30:56.490
Three men carried out
the live field tests.

30:56.557 --> 30:57.724
How did they survive?

30:57.742 --> 31:00.027
Apparently they were inoculated.

31:00.061 --> 31:03.163
But when they tried
to start families...

31:03.230 --> 31:05.065
The toxin affected
their unborn children.

31:05.133 --> 31:07.034
Now, couldn't find anything
in Downey's personal file

31:07.085 --> 31:08.418
you haven't already seen.

31:08.503 --> 31:10.387
But I found something

31:10.455 --> 31:12.222
in the D.O.D. payroll database.

31:12.256 --> 31:13.373
Turn to the last page.

31:13.424 --> 31:17.361
In addition to a large cash payment,

31:17.428 --> 31:20.447
Downey was given three acres
of government land.

31:20.515 --> 31:22.049
Farm land at Pembroke,

31:22.100 --> 31:24.635
twenty-five miles south of Boston.

31:35.363 --> 31:37.731
How's it coming?

31:39.984 --> 31:41.434
Are we good?

31:52.997 --> 31:55.281
Yeah, we're good.

32:23.685 --> 32:24.768
We're fine.

32:24.852 --> 32:28.305
The powder is fully oxidized.

32:32.894 --> 32:35.062
Jeez.

32:35.113 --> 32:38.065
The vest would allow them
to spread the powder themselves.

32:38.116 --> 32:41.068
Yeah, in large quantities.

32:41.119 --> 32:42.786
Yeah, looks like
they got bigger plans

32:42.870 --> 32:43.937
than just three guys
in an elevator.

32:43.988 --> 32:45.455
And then there's this.

32:45.540 --> 32:47.774
Looks like a map of their
next target, right?

32:47.825 --> 32:50.093
Maybe an overhead view.

32:50.161 --> 32:52.162
Dunham!

32:56.968 --> 32:58.936
Congressman Jim Thorn.

32:58.970 --> 33:00.804
Isn't he a former Army General?

33:00.888 --> 33:03.257
He was Senior Military Advisor
to the Joint Chiefs

33:03.308 --> 33:04.457
at the time of Project Jellyfish.

33:04.509 --> 33:06.977
So you think he approved
the project?

33:07.061 --> 33:09.263
I need to alert Thorn's detail.

33:17.138 --> 33:19.840
Didn't Simon write something
down about Maryann?

33:19.874 --> 33:21.275
What?

33:21.342 --> 33:22.926
When Simon was reading
Downey mind,

33:22.994 --> 33:24.094
Didn't he say he saw the image
of the name Maryann?

33:24.162 --> 33:25.462
Yeah, why?

33:25.530 --> 33:26.479
Because I think I just found her.

33:26.531 --> 33:29.499
That's the Fine Arts Museum.

33:29.584 --> 33:30.584
Okay, so what does the museum

33:30.651 --> 33:31.985
have to do with Congressman Thorn?

33:32.036 --> 33:33.670
He's holding a fundraiser.

33:33.755 --> 33:35.989
It's an event for three
hundred of his top donors.

33:36.007 --> 33:38.992
It started half an hour ago.

33:44.482 --> 33:46.283
I'm not going home, am I?

33:59.113 --> 34:00.547
Peter's inside briefing
the Congressman.

34:00.615 --> 34:01.698
How good a shot are you?

34:01.783 --> 34:04.434
Uh, I'm okay. Why?

34:04.502 --> 34:06.236
If either of those two guys
have a hand trigger,

34:06.304 --> 34:07.854
You're only gonna get one shot.

34:07.905 --> 34:10.007
Put it through the mouth
to sever the spinal cord.

34:10.074 --> 34:12.208
That way the suspect
won't have a chance to detonate.

34:12.243 --> 34:13.543
Are you sure he's up for this?

34:16.848 --> 34:18.465
I hope so.

34:18.533 --> 34:20.650
Because without Simon,
we can't identify the suspects.

34:20.717 --> 34:23.870
If Simon can't do it...

34:23.920 --> 34:25.722
You get out there.

34:38.268 --> 34:39.985
Agent Dunham with the FBI.

34:40.054 --> 34:41.355
- Where's Congressman Thorn?
- Inside.

34:41.438 --> 34:43.239
We've already been through this
with your Agent Bishop.

34:43.324 --> 34:45.242
Then why haven't you
taken him to safety?

34:45.326 --> 34:46.610
You ever try telling
a four-star General

34:46.694 --> 34:47.911
to take a death threat seriously?

34:47.995 --> 34:49.096
This is not a threat.

34:49.163 --> 34:50.414
I've already seen
what these guys

34:50.498 --> 34:51.665
are capable of and
everyone here is at risk.

34:51.732 --> 34:54.067
So you keep him in the back.

35:00.591 --> 35:04.428
The tall one thinks you're hot.

35:04.512 --> 35:06.346
We're making our way
to the ground floor.

35:06.414 --> 35:07.881
<i>Copy that.</i>

35:19.260 --> 35:21.111
Okay.

35:21.195 --> 35:23.397
It's okay.
You can do this.

35:27.702 --> 35:29.786
Hey, you're not supposed
to be here.

35:29.821 --> 35:32.072
- This area is for staff only.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

35:32.123 --> 35:33.407
We're just looking
for the restroom.

35:33.458 --> 35:34.825
He's had a little bit
too much to drink.

35:34.909 --> 35:36.793
<i>Who is she? A cop?</i>

35:36.911 --> 35:38.662
<i>I have to get out.</i>

35:38.746 --> 35:42.082
- The restroom's downstairs.
- Thank you.

35:42.133 --> 35:43.550
That's him.

35:43.617 --> 35:44.634
- What?
- That's him.

35:44.719 --> 35:48.455
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

35:48.506 --> 35:50.507
Okay. You wait here.

36:24.292 --> 36:25.942
Damn it.

36:26.010 --> 36:28.345
<i>Suspect one's down,
but he's not wearing the vest.</i>

36:28.429 --> 36:29.963
<i>The other suspect
must be carrying the toxin.</i>

36:30.014 --> 36:31.598
Copy that.

36:31.665 --> 36:34.384
<i>I going back out there with Simon.</i>

36:34.452 --> 36:37.137
She'll be all right, Peter.

37:16.916 --> 37:18.784
<i>Where's Thorn?</i>

37:18.868 --> 37:20.202
<i>Something's not right.</i>

37:20.253 --> 37:21.536
<i>This is not how it's supposed to go.</i>

37:21.570 --> 37:24.239
<i>- Where's Dillon?</i>
- He's here.

37:24.290 --> 37:26.091
<i>Something is definitely wrong.</i>

37:26.175 --> 37:27.876
There. Blue tie.

37:27.927 --> 37:29.428
<i>Thorn should be here by now.</i>

37:44.143 --> 37:45.894
I'm sorry, sir.
You can't come through here.

37:45.945 --> 37:47.396
Oh, I'm looking for my wife.

37:47.447 --> 37:49.698
I think she went out
onto the balcony.

37:49.765 --> 37:51.766
You'll need to use
a different exit.

38:21.097 --> 38:23.348
Coffee.
Black, one sugar.

38:23.433 --> 38:25.467
Thank you.

38:25.518 --> 38:27.185
And I've been
meaning to tell you...

38:27.270 --> 38:29.137
You look great in the dress.

38:54.393 --> 38:56.394
Thank you.

38:59.131 --> 39:02.133
It doesn't have to
be like this, you know?

39:02.200 --> 39:05.903
Living out here the way
that you do.

39:05.971 --> 39:09.073
I guess what I'm trying to say

39:09.141 --> 39:11.275
is that you should go
and talk to that girl.

39:14.246 --> 39:17.615
You still don't understand,
Olivia.

39:17.683 --> 39:20.651
We're not supposed to know
what people think.

39:24.222 --> 39:28.793
Simon, don't let your ability
stop you from living your life.

39:36.435 --> 39:39.570
I may not be able
to read your mind,

39:39.638 --> 39:42.473
but I read his.

39:42.541 --> 39:48.512
This is what it's like
to be me.

40:16.274 --> 40:18.075
No.

40:53.749 --> 40:55.934
I can see you didn't bring
your bowling shoes.

40:56.019 --> 40:58.586
That's gonna ba problem
if you intend break 100.

40:58.638 --> 40:59.938
Maybe next time.

41:00.023 --> 41:03.525
Tonight, I have a different problem.

41:03.592 --> 41:05.760
Tell me about the first people.

41:05.812 --> 41:09.364
Start with why those books
seem to indicate

41:09.432 --> 41:10.849
that you wrote them,

41:10.917 --> 41:14.453
then move on to what
the device is intend for.

41:14.520 --> 41:16.622
So you found it.

41:16.706 --> 41:20.125
You never to me about this.

41:23.997 --> 41:25.414
Ahem.

41:25.465 --> 41:26.965
I'm not your problem.
Peter Bishop is.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.468
Go on.

41:31.587 --> 41:34.172
Okay.
What I can tell you is this:

41:34.257 --> 41:36.675
That device can either be used

41:36.759 --> 41:39.061
as a tool of creation
or as a weapon or destruction.

41:39.128 --> 41:40.512
Depends on your point of view.

41:40.596 --> 41:46.018
And Peter Bishop
is uniquely tuned to operate it.

41:46.102 --> 41:51.323
Whatever frequency
Peter's vibrating at

41:51.407 --> 41:53.191
will determine
how the machine reacts.

41:53.276 --> 41:56.028
And what determines
Peter's frequency?

41:56.112 --> 41:59.247
Depends on his state of mind,
which, in turn,

41:59.315 --> 42:00.749
will depend on
who he ends up with.

42:00.816 --> 42:05.153
Olivia from here
or Olivia from over there.

42:05.204 --> 42:07.005
Whichever one he chooses,

42:07.040 --> 42:12.344
it'll be her universe
that survives.

42:12.428 --> 42:16.765
So in that case,
there's no cause for concern.

42:16.832 --> 42:18.650
He'll choose our Olivia.

42:18.718 --> 42:23.722
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
