WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:03.462
MALCOLM:

00:02.085 --> 00:03.462
Bottom of the ninth.

00:03.504 --> 00:05.840
Two outs, man on first.

00:05.881 --> 00:07.007
The windup...

00:07.883 --> 00:09.009
The pitch...

00:12.471 --> 00:13.931
Uh-oh.

00:13.973 --> 00:15.432
Oh, man, we're so dead.

00:15.474 --> 00:16.851
That's it. Game over.

00:16.892 --> 00:17.977
Yeah.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.854
So I win.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.854
What?!

00:19.895 --> 00:21.897
Past the lamp is a home run.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.064
Two men scored.

00:23.106 --> 00:23.983
That was a foul ball.

00:24.023 --> 00:24.984
Are you crazy?

00:25.024 --> 00:26.067
It went right down the line.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.736
It was foul.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.736
Shut up.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.070
You're home plate.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.070
You don't get a vote.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.072
And it was fair.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.072
Do over.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.533
Fine by me.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.080
Oh, crap!

00:39.122 --> 00:40.081
Now we really have to quit.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.083
Yeah, but that was a triple.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.961

The thing

about playing

01:26.837 --> 01:28.505
at Stevie

01:26.837 --> 01:28.505
Kenarban's house is

01:28.547 --> 01:31.132
he has every one

01:28.547 --> 01:31.132
of my favorite video games

01:31.174 --> 01:32.760
from when I was four.

01:32.801 --> 01:36.513
End of... the rainbow.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.139
I win...

01:38.181 --> 01:40.141
the gold.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.142
Don't you have something

01:41.184 --> 01:43.020
with a little bit

01:41.184 --> 01:43.020
more violence in it?

01:43.062 --> 01:45.856
Fishing... for Fishies.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.608
Sometimes...

01:47.649 --> 01:49.150
he drowns.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.402
Boys!

01:50.444 --> 01:52.112
I've got snacks.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.155
Hands.

01:57.284 --> 02:00.037
Now... who wants applesauce?

02:00.079 --> 02:01.162
I do.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.415
Stevie, there is no need

02:01.204 --> 02:03.415
to use your outdoor voice.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.583
And I've got

02:03.457 --> 02:04.583
some cinnamon

02:04.625 --> 02:07.168
if you guys are feeling

02:04.625 --> 02:07.168
a little crazy.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.880
Feeling... crazy?

02:09.922 --> 02:10.839
A little.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.215
(horn honking)

02:12.257 --> 02:13.675
That's my mom.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.218
Oh, well, she always honks.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.763
Tell her she's welcome

02:15.260 --> 02:17.763
to come in anytime.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.180
We're not going to bite.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.181
It's not personal.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.558
I think she just

02:20.223 --> 02:21.558
likes honking.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.810
LOIS:

02:21.600 --> 02:22.810
Malcolm!

02:22.851 --> 02:24.185
Well, you'd

02:22.851 --> 02:24.185
better get going.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.353
I mean, you don't

02:24.227 --> 02:25.353
want to make her mad.

02:25.395 --> 02:26.271
She's always mad.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.230
Malcolm, I mean it!

02:27.272 --> 02:28.440
I have ice

02:27.272 --> 02:28.440
cream melting!

02:28.482 --> 02:30.191
Here's your...

02:28.482 --> 02:30.191
Oh, no, no, no.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.192
Eat it in the car.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.486
Eat it in the car.

02:33.904 --> 02:35.906
(phone ringing)

02:39.242 --> 02:40.201
Oops.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.161
Jerk.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.246
You looked.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.206
Ow!

02:45.248 --> 02:46.625
We're doing

02:45.248 --> 02:46.625
this new thing

02:46.667 --> 02:47.876
called the circle game.

02:47.918 --> 02:50.045
Basically, if you

02:47.918 --> 02:50.045
can make the other guy

02:50.087 --> 02:52.380
look at your hand

02:50.087 --> 02:52.380
while you're doing this...

02:52.422 --> 02:54.842
below your waist,

02:52.422 --> 02:54.842
you get to hit them in the arm.

02:54.883 --> 02:57.218
It's stupid, but, hey--

02:54.883 --> 02:57.218
you get to hit people.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.219
Barn door's open.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.178
Huh?

03:01.264 --> 03:02.641
Aah!

03:02.683 --> 03:03.892
Boys.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.226
That was

03:03.934 --> 03:05.226
Kitty Kenarban.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.270
She wants to go

03:05.268 --> 03:07.270
out for dinner.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.230
That sounds like fun.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.230
Good for you, dear.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.607
She meant the whole family.

03:10.649 --> 03:11.525
Oh.

03:11.566 --> 03:12.526
MALCOLM:

03:11.566 --> 03:12.526
Mom, I don't think

03:12.567 --> 03:13.819
that's really

03:12.567 --> 03:13.819
a good idea.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.070
I mean, the

03:13.861 --> 03:15.070
Kenarbans

03:15.112 --> 03:17.906
are kind of...

03:15.112 --> 03:17.906
well, boring.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.658
They're refined, Malcolm,

03:19.700 --> 03:20.909
and it wouldn't be

03:19.700 --> 03:20.909
the worst thing in the world

03:20.951 --> 03:23.244
if some of their manners

03:20.951 --> 03:23.244
rubbed off on you boys.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.080
I just don't think you guys

03:23.286 --> 03:25.080
would get along with them.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.247
Don't be silly.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.959
I think it's nice

03:26.289 --> 03:28.959
she's asking us out to dinner.

03:29.001 --> 03:31.920
It's been a long time since

03:29.001 --> 03:31.920
anyone invited us anywhere.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.964
I wonder why that is.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.924
I think I see

03:34.006 --> 03:35.924
some hungry seals.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.301
(boys barking like seals)

03:38.343 --> 03:41.221
(barking)

03:49.312 --> 03:51.565
Cadets...

03:51.606 --> 03:56.195
as you know, I don't often

03:51.606 --> 03:56.195
reveal my... personal side,

03:56.236 --> 03:59.280
but after 20 years

03:56.236 --> 03:59.280
of separation,

03:59.322 --> 04:04.285
my mother has agreed

03:59.322 --> 04:04.285
to visit with me this weekend.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.287
She is a very demanding woman,

04:06.329 --> 04:09.124
and I haven't seen her

04:06.329 --> 04:09.124
for a long time.

04:09.166 --> 04:14.088
I want things to go well.

04:14.129 --> 04:18.592
That means I will have no time

04:14.129 --> 04:18.592
for antics, shenanigans,

04:18.633 --> 04:20.969
hooliganism

04:18.633 --> 04:20.969
or tomfoolery.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.180
There will be no problems

04:23.222 --> 04:27.308
which take me away

04:23.222 --> 04:27.308
from time with Mother.

04:27.350 --> 04:31.021
This is important to me,

04:27.350 --> 04:31.021
which makes it...

04:31.063 --> 04:32.564
CADETS:

04:31.063 --> 04:32.564
Important to us.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.233
So it is crystal clear.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.735
I will not

04:34.274 --> 04:36.735
be disturbed this weekend.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.320
CADETS:

04:36.777 --> 04:39.320
Yes, sir!

04:39.362 --> 04:40.530
As you were.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.325
Whoa, he sounds

04:42.741 --> 04:44.325
pretty serious.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.954
Yeah. What time you want

04:44.367 --> 04:46.954
to start the party?

04:46.995 --> 04:48.371
Hmm?

04:46.995 --> 04:48.371
What are you

04:46.995 --> 04:48.371
talking about?

04:48.413 --> 04:50.749
Didn't you hear

04:48.413 --> 04:50.749
what Spangler just said?

04:50.791 --> 04:53.334
All I heard was

04:50.791 --> 04:53.334
he's going

04:50.791 --> 04:53.334
to be too busy

04:53.376 --> 04:55.336
with his mother

04:53.376 --> 04:55.336
to pay us any attention.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.798
What kind of party

04:55.378 --> 04:57.798
did you have in mind?

04:57.839 --> 04:59.049
Oh, I don't know.

04:59.091 --> 05:01.009
I'm sure I can come

04:59.091 --> 05:01.009
up with something

05:01.051 --> 05:02.469
that we'll all find amusing.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.243
Well, howdy, girls.

05:26.285 --> 05:28.245
I couldn't help

05:26.285 --> 05:28.245
but notice you all

05:28.287 --> 05:30.038
hanging out here

05:28.287 --> 05:30.038
by the fence

05:30.080 --> 05:31.372
for the last six months.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.625
Would you like to come

05:31.414 --> 05:33.625
to a party tomorrow night?

05:33.667 --> 05:36.377
Wh... you're going

05:33.667 --> 05:36.377
to let us come inside?

05:36.419 --> 05:38.046
(giggles)

05:38.088 --> 05:40.799
Oh, well, sure, that'd be

05:38.088 --> 05:40.799
the neighborly thing to do.

05:40.841 --> 05:45.386
I would kill or die

05:40.841 --> 05:45.386
to go to your party.

05:45.428 --> 05:48.056
Seriously-- kill or die.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.683
Well, that's the spirit.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.392
Okay, I'll take you

05:51.434 --> 05:53.436
and you and you

05:53.478 --> 05:54.437
and you.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.605
Wait a minute.

05:55.647 --> 05:57.316
Isn't this kind

05:55.647 --> 05:57.316
of degrading?

05:57.356 --> 05:58.650
Okay, not you

05:58.692 --> 06:00.694
and you and you...

06:02.904 --> 06:05.406
I want to eat

06:02.904 --> 06:05.406
that one and that one.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.867
Oh, and those two.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.327
Isn't this nice?

06:08.367 --> 06:10.620
No pirate themes.

06:10.662 --> 06:14.624
No ball pits filled

06:10.662 --> 06:14.624
with screaming children.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.668
Hal, look.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.338
"Please wait to be seated."

06:19.378 --> 06:20.297
Look, a dollar.

06:20.339 --> 06:21.380
Oh, it's mine.

06:23.382 --> 06:27.428
Damn. I never fall

06:23.382 --> 06:27.428
for that amateur stuff.

06:27.470 --> 06:30.849
Now, I am going to say this

06:27.470 --> 06:30.849
once and only once.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.642
We are with

06:30.891 --> 06:32.642
respectable

06:30.891 --> 06:32.642
people tonight.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.602
You are to be well mannered

06:32.684 --> 06:34.602
and act civilized,

06:34.644 --> 06:36.730
or so help me, I'll wring

06:34.644 --> 06:36.730
your little necks, you hear me?

06:39.524 --> 06:42.277
Okay, here's the plan if we want

06:39.524 --> 06:42.277
to ditch out of this thing.

06:42.319 --> 06:43.444
At the beginning,

06:42.319 --> 06:43.444
I'll say that I think

06:43.486 --> 06:44.696
I might be coming down

06:43.486 --> 06:44.696
with something...

06:44.738 --> 06:46.614
Hal, I don't want to

06:44.738 --> 06:46.614
ditch out of this.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.908
I'm looking

06:46.656 --> 06:47.908
forward to it.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.450
The Kenarbans

06:47.949 --> 06:49.450
are nice people,

06:49.492 --> 06:51.161
and they want to be

06:49.492 --> 06:51.161
friends with us.

06:51.203 --> 06:52.913
So you're-you're saying

06:51.203 --> 06:52.913
I'm on my own here.

06:52.954 --> 06:53.914
Yoo-hoo, hi there.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.540
Hello.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.457
Abe.

06:56.499 --> 06:57.709
Hal. I think I might

06:57.751 --> 06:59.669
be coming down

06:57.751 --> 06:59.669
with something.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.462
Sorry we're late--

06:59.711 --> 07:01.462
some jackass

07:01.504 --> 07:03.882
parked in the

07:01.504 --> 07:03.882
handicapped space.

07:03.924 --> 07:07.719
Oh, huh, huh.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.846
Why don't you guys

07:07.761 --> 07:09.846
get seated and I-I...

07:09.888 --> 07:11.890
I got to get something

07:09.888 --> 07:11.890
out of the car.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.850
I'll just be a...

07:13.892 --> 07:17.729
(dance music playing)

07:17.771 --> 07:19.356
(girls cheering)

07:21.775 --> 07:24.111
Why didn't we think

07:21.775 --> 07:24.111
of doing this sooner?

07:28.615 --> 07:31.368
Don't you think they're

07:28.615 --> 07:31.368
getting a little loud?

07:31.410 --> 07:34.246
Spangler's only

07:31.410 --> 07:34.246
two buildings over.

07:35.247 --> 07:36.497
Uh... ladies.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.499
This is all great,

07:36.539 --> 07:38.499
but if we could just

07:38.541 --> 07:40.043
take it down a teensy bit.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.545
Whoo! I marked him, girl!

07:42.587 --> 07:43.797
He's mine!

07:43.838 --> 07:45.465
(girls cheering loudly)

07:48.927 --> 07:50.511
Now, remember,

07:50.553 --> 07:52.513
no throwing ice.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.515
No flicking butter

07:52.555 --> 07:54.515
at the ceiling.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.184
No sticking gum

07:54.557 --> 07:56.184
under the table

07:56.226 --> 07:58.478
and no eating gum already

07:56.226 --> 07:58.478
stuck under the table.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.730
Keep your

07:59.354 --> 08:00.730
voices down.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.607
You are warned.

08:02.649 --> 08:03.942
You look very

08:02.649 --> 08:03.942
nice, Stevie.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.528
Oh, great.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.738
Who spilled?

08:09.572 --> 08:11.532
Aw.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.533
Ow.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.535
Circle game?

08:14.577 --> 08:17.331
I want to... play.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.539
I don't know, Stevie.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.000
It's... it's pretty rough.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.542
Oh, come on, quit babying him.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.462
If he wants to play,

08:21.584 --> 08:23.462
let him play.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.422
Now, remember, Stevie,

08:23.503 --> 08:25.422
don't look at this...

08:26.173 --> 08:27.966
...uh... or this.

08:32.304 --> 08:35.390
He's... good.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.270
Well, this

08:38.518 --> 08:40.270
is nice.

08:40.312 --> 08:42.605
I've been looking forward

08:40.312 --> 08:42.605
to this for a long time.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.565
I don't know why we

08:42.647 --> 08:44.565
didn't do this sooner.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.234
(laughs)

08:49.904 --> 08:51.156
Do I feel flush?

08:51.198 --> 08:52.573
No.

08:52.615 --> 08:55.076
Would anyone like a

08:52.615 --> 08:55.076
drink before you order?

08:55.118 --> 08:56.077
Oh, yeah.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.579
Uh, he'll have

08:56.119 --> 08:58.579
a diet soda.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.580
And you, sir?

08:59.622 --> 09:00.832
Uh...

09:00.874 --> 09:02.583
what the heck--

09:00.874 --> 09:02.583
lemonade.

09:02.625 --> 09:03.835
I'll have an iced tea.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.586
Sorry, we're out.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.588
Oh, uh, well, then,

09:05.628 --> 09:07.588
I'll have a...

09:07.630 --> 09:09.424
Wait a minute-- what's

09:07.630 --> 09:09.424
that guy having?

09:10.633 --> 09:12.386
That's hot tea.

09:12.427 --> 09:13.594
This is ridiculous.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.389
You have tea, you have ice.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.639
Make her some iced tea.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.099
Oh, no, no, no,

09:16.681 --> 09:18.099
that is fine.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.309
I would love

09:18.141 --> 09:19.309
a hot tea.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.612
Wow.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.449
This is really nice.

09:37.035 --> 09:40.580
Well, I have to

09:37.035 --> 09:40.580
use the restroom.

09:45.752 --> 09:50.549
I think I also need

09:45.752 --> 09:50.549
to use the restroom.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.643
(girls screaming)

10:02.685 --> 10:05.021
Girls! You've got

10:02.685 --> 10:05.021

Well, gentlemen--

I've had enough experience

10:32.715 --> 10:34.175
to know when to cut your losses.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.094
It's time to get Spangler.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.305
No. Come on,

10:36.136 --> 10:38.305
we're not wusses.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.140
We can handle this ourselves.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.350
I'm going to put a stop

10:40.181 --> 10:42.350
to this right now.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.352
All right, girls,

10:42.392 --> 10:44.352
party's over.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.686
(girls screaming)

10:45.728 --> 10:47.855
Help! Mama!

10:47.897 --> 10:49.690
They're seeing my underpants.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.067
Help!

11:06.249 --> 11:07.792
(vicious yell)

11:07.834 --> 11:11.712
Nice... one.

11:11.754 --> 11:12.713
Stevie, quit the game.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.007
You're just getting punched.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.425
You haven't gotten us once.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.177
Oh, yeah?

11:17.218 --> 11:18.595
Then how come...

11:18.637 --> 11:21.722
you saw...

11:21.764 --> 11:23.350
this?

11:26.269 --> 11:27.728
Damn.

11:27.770 --> 11:31.732
I swear, Hal, you said,

11:27.770 --> 11:31.732
"I feel flushed"

11:31.774 --> 11:33.985
five seconds

11:31.774 --> 11:33.985
before I was about to.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.985
Oh, yeah?

11:34.027 --> 11:36.530
(Reese grunts viciously)

11:34.027 --> 11:36.530
Salud.

11:36.571 --> 11:40.325
Look at us now--

11:36.571 --> 11:40.325
two grown men

11:40.367 --> 11:42.910
having to sneak off from their

11:40.367 --> 11:42.910
wives just to have a drink.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.746
How sad.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.746
Nah, no, no.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.748
It's really not like that

11:45.788 --> 11:47.748
with me and Kitty.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.917
Sure, I might let her think

11:47.790 --> 11:49.917
she's in charge,

11:49.959 --> 11:52.170
but when it comes down

11:49.959 --> 11:52.170
to the important stuff,

11:52.212 --> 11:53.588
Daddy rules the roost.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.965
Oh, hi, Kitty.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.760
I got you!

11:57.509 --> 11:59.760
(laughing)

11:59.802 --> 12:02.055
(both laughing)

11:59.802 --> 12:02.055
I did.

12:02.096 --> 12:03.223
To being whipped.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.391
Like butter, my friend.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.560
(Reese grunts viciously)

12:06.601 --> 12:09.312
Kitty.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.486
Where are those guys?

12:16.528 --> 12:19.573
Hal probably dragged

12:16.528 --> 12:19.573
Abe over to the bar.

12:19.614 --> 12:20.948
You know, if he's drunk,

12:19.614 --> 12:20.948
so help me...

12:20.990 --> 12:22.200
Oh, no-no-no. It's okay.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.744
Gives us a chance to talk.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.417
Here we are--

12:27.997 --> 12:30.417
diet soda...

12:30.458 --> 12:32.419
lemonade...

12:32.460 --> 12:33.712
and cranberry juice.

12:33.752 --> 12:36.797
Thank you.

12:33.752 --> 12:36.797
Cranberry juice?

12:36.839 --> 12:38.799
After all that static he

12:36.839 --> 12:38.799
gave you about ordering tea,

12:38.841 --> 12:40.093
he gives you cranberry juice?

12:40.134 --> 12:41.802
Excuse me?

12:40.134 --> 12:41.802
No-no-no,

12:41.844 --> 12:42.596
it's fine.

12:42.637 --> 12:43.804
Something wrong?

12:43.846 --> 12:45.265
Yes. My friend ordered tea

12:45.306 --> 12:47.726
and you've brought her

12:45.306 --> 12:47.726
cranberry juice.

12:47.766 --> 12:49.436
I don't think so.

12:49.477 --> 12:50.811
Instead of arguing with me,

12:49.477 --> 12:50.811
why don't you

12:50.853 --> 12:52.272
just march back

12:50.853 --> 12:52.272
to the kitchen and make...

12:52.313 --> 12:54.482
No-no-no.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.482
I like cranberry juice.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.943
Very healthy for you. Mmm...

13:01.030 --> 13:02.823
MALCOLM:

13:01.030 --> 13:02.823
Hey, Reese, that's enough!

13:02.865 --> 13:04.409
This isn't funny anymore.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.826
Okay, okay.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.454
Man, look what

13:05.868 --> 13:07.454
your shoulders did

13:07.495 --> 13:08.663
to my knuckles.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.836
I'll get you

13:12.333 --> 13:15.836
when I come back.

13:15.878 --> 13:18.839
I even knew...

13:18.881 --> 13:20.841
he was going...

13:20.883 --> 13:22.260
to do that.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.429
She won't let me

13:24.471 --> 13:27.474
have butter on my

13:24.471 --> 13:27.474
bread--  butter.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.685
I haven't eaten the

13:27.515 --> 13:30.685
stuff in ten years.

13:30.727 --> 13:33.854
How'd this happen?

13:33.896 --> 13:35.774
We weren't always this way.

13:35.814 --> 13:36.857
Actually, I was.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.025
Classic story--

13:38.067 --> 13:41.738
raised by a grandmother

13:38.067 --> 13:41.738
and four spinster aunts.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.865
I used to wash their

13:41.780 --> 13:44.865
hair on Saturday nights.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.868
You poor bastard,

13:44.907 --> 13:47.868
you never had a chance.

13:47.910 --> 13:51.830
Damn it... enough is enough!

14:04.969 --> 14:06.721
(gasps)

14:06.763 --> 14:08.640
You go, Abe!

14:11.518 --> 14:13.520
Go! Go! Go!

14:23.446 --> 14:24.905
Sir?

14:24.947 --> 14:26.324
SPANGLER:

14:24.947 --> 14:26.324
Go away!

14:26.366 --> 14:28.576
I told you I did not

14:26.366 --> 14:28.576
want to be disturbed.

14:28.618 --> 14:31.162
My aunt and I are...

14:28.618 --> 14:31.162
catching up.

14:31.204 --> 14:35.041
I... I thought you said

14:31.204 --> 14:35.041
it was your mother, sir.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.918
Go away!

14:37.960 --> 14:39.212
I wish I could, sir,

14:39.253 --> 14:41.088
but we have

14:39.253 --> 14:41.088
a bit of a situation.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.132
See, we decided

14:41.130 --> 14:43.132
to have this party

14:43.174 --> 14:44.634
and it kind of

14:43.174 --> 14:44.634
got out of hand...

14:44.676 --> 14:45.926
I don't care, cadet.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.928
I will deal with

14:45.968 --> 14:47.928
it in the morning.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.928
Yeah, but...

14:47.970 --> 14:49.222
In the morning!

14:49.263 --> 14:51.932
It's just that we invited

14:49.263 --> 14:51.932
some of the local girls...

14:51.974 --> 14:53.059
Local girls?!

14:55.812 --> 14:57.980
There are local girls

14:55.812 --> 14:57.980
inside the perimeter?

14:58.022 --> 14:59.357
Have they killed anyone?

14:59.399 --> 15:00.608
N-No, sir,

15:00.650 --> 15:02.777
but I saw one of them

15:00.650 --> 15:02.777
eat a raw chicken whole.

15:02.819 --> 15:06.406
WOMAN: Spangy.

15:02.819 --> 15:06.406
Uh... just a minute... Mother.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.867
Do you have any idea

15:06.447 --> 15:08.867
what you have done?

15:08.908 --> 15:11.118
Marlin Academy

15:08.908 --> 15:11.118
cannot exist

15:11.160 --> 15:13.954
without the support, the

15:11.160 --> 15:13.954
goodwill and cooperation

15:13.996 --> 15:15.415
of the local community.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.957
The police chief and the mayor

15:16.999 --> 15:18.585
both sit

15:16.999 --> 15:18.585
on our board of governors!

15:18.626 --> 15:20.461
The fire chief

15:18.626 --> 15:20.461
is a regent!

15:20.503 --> 15:24.215
And right now their psychotic

15:20.503 --> 15:24.215
offspring are in there

15:24.257 --> 15:26.843
tearing up the floorboards!

15:26.885 --> 15:29.970
It won't be long

15:26.885 --> 15:29.970
before they're in the air ducts.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.972
What are we going

15:30.012 --> 15:31.972
to do, sir?

15:32.014 --> 15:35.226
We are going to do

15:32.014 --> 15:35.226
what any self-respecting

15:32.014 --> 15:35.226
member of society does

15:35.268 --> 15:38.062
in a situation like this--

15:35.268 --> 15:38.062
we're going to keep it quiet.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.564
But they're destroying

15:38.104 --> 15:39.564
the school.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.608
Let's hope that's

15:39.606 --> 15:41.608
all they do, cadet.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.651
I'm afraid this is

15:41.649 --> 15:43.651
like an oil fire--

15:43.693 --> 15:45.570
we have to let it

15:43.693 --> 15:45.570
burn itself out.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.740
Oh, yeah, I forgot--

15:45.612 --> 15:48.740
one of them started an oil fire.

15:52.702 --> 15:55.705
So...

15:55.747 --> 15:57.998
did you see

15:55.747 --> 15:57.998
any good movies lately?

15:58.040 --> 16:00.209
Well, we just saw

15:58.040 --> 16:00.209
Les Amants du Pont-Neuf.

16:00.251 --> 16:01.377
Did you see it?

16:01.419 --> 16:03.296
No.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.173
Last movie I saw was

16:06.215 --> 16:09.009
The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes

16:06.215 --> 16:09.009
on cable.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.679
Oh, my God! Kurt Russell!

16:09.051 --> 16:11.679
Yes.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.014
Oh, I had such a crush on him

16:11.721 --> 16:14.014
in those Disney films.

16:14.056 --> 16:17.017
I did, too--

16:14.056 --> 16:17.017
especially in  Now You See It...

16:17.059 --> 16:18.227
BOTH:

16:17.059 --> 16:18.227
Now You Don't!

16:18.269 --> 16:20.020
Oh, God...

16:18.269 --> 16:20.020
Oh, he was so cute.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.857
Did you see  The Strongest Man

16:20.062 --> 16:22.857
in the World?

16:20.062 --> 16:22.857
About 50 times.

16:22.899 --> 16:26.611
Oh, my God!

16:22.899 --> 16:26.611
I just wanted to reach out

16:22.899 --> 16:26.611
and grab that tush.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.404
I am so terrible.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.072
(both laughing)

16:30.114 --> 16:32.116
Seriously, this

16:30.114 --> 16:32.116
has got to stop.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.285
I'm actually starting

16:32.158 --> 16:34.285
to feel bad

16:34.327 --> 16:37.497
and plus... I'm

16:34.327 --> 16:37.497
kind of getting

16:34.327 --> 16:37.497
bored creatively.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.874
Oh, my God!

16:39.916 --> 16:41.334
Is that a snake?

16:39.916 --> 16:41.334
Stevie, don't.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.127
REESE:

16:41.375 --> 16:43.127
Sucker.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.422
Snake...

16:46.464 --> 16:48.007
I'm an idiot.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.682
(Lois and Kitty laughing)

16:58.476 --> 17:00.060
Oh...

17:00.102 --> 17:02.229
I'm so glad we decided

17:00.102 --> 17:02.229
to have this dinner.

17:02.271 --> 17:05.065
So am I.

17:02.271 --> 17:05.065
I feel so much better now.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.776
Better?

17:06.818 --> 17:08.277
About you and your family.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.904
What?

17:09.946 --> 17:11.155
A-A-About Malcolm and Stevie

17:11.197 --> 17:13.157
because they spend

17:11.197 --> 17:13.157
so much time together,

17:13.199 --> 17:15.368
and now that we've gotten

17:13.199 --> 17:15.368
to know each other,

17:15.409 --> 17:16.452
I just feel better.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.162
Wait a minute.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.373
You mean this wasn't about

17:18.204 --> 17:20.373
you wanting to be friends?

17:20.414 --> 17:21.541
Yes, it was.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.167
No, it wasn't.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.585
You were checking us out.

17:24.627 --> 17:27.254
You wanted to see if we were

17:24.627 --> 17:27.254
good enough for your family.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.298
No, no, no. I-I wouldn't

17:27.296 --> 17:29.298
put it that way.

17:29.340 --> 17:32.301
I would, because

17:29.340 --> 17:32.301
that's what you're doing.

17:32.343 --> 17:34.136
How dare you!

17:34.178 --> 17:35.513
You can't judge us.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.681
You know,

17:36.723 --> 17:38.516
you are not

17:36.723 --> 17:38.516
so perfect yourself, lady.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.185
Hell, you are one of the most

17:38.558 --> 17:41.185
uptight, repressed people

17:41.227 --> 17:42.520
I've ever met in my life.

17:42.562 --> 17:46.106
Did you know that Kurt Russell

17:42.562 --> 17:46.106
was the jungle boy

17:46.148 --> 17:48.108
on  Gilligan's Island?

17:48.150 --> 17:49.402
Don't change the subject.

17:49.443 --> 17:50.486
We're having an

17:49.443 --> 17:50.486
argument here.

17:50.528 --> 17:51.571
I yell at you;

17:50.528 --> 17:51.571
you yell at me--

17:51.612 --> 17:52.530
that's what you do.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.614
What's wrong with you?

17:53.656 --> 17:55.115
Whatever you say

17:53.656 --> 17:55.115
is wrong with me

17:55.157 --> 17:56.283
is what's wrong with me.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.410
There-- problem solved.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.078
(chuckles nervously)

18:09.338 --> 18:11.340
(groans softly)

18:13.760 --> 18:17.221
Okay, that's just freaky.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.515
REESE:

18:17.263 --> 18:19.515
Hey, I'm getting

18:17.263 --> 18:19.515
good with my left.

18:19.557 --> 18:20.808
Thanks, Stevie.

18:21.976 --> 18:24.729
I... give up.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.146
I'm going to...

18:26.188 --> 18:28.148
the car.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.156
(crying softly)

18:36.198 --> 18:37.366
Way to go, Reese.

18:37.408 --> 18:39.118
Aw, geez!

18:47.627 --> 18:50.254
Crying on... command...

18:50.296 --> 18:53.173
got me... a cable modem.

18:54.592 --> 18:55.551
You have a real problem.

18:55.593 --> 18:56.677
Have you never

18:55.593 --> 18:56.677
yelled at anyone

18:56.719 --> 18:57.971
in your entire life?

18:58.012 --> 18:59.555
I just don't see

18:58.012 --> 18:59.555
what it accomplishes.

18:59.597 --> 19:00.765
Are you kidding?

19:00.807 --> 19:02.558
Most of the time,

19:00.807 --> 19:02.558
if you're not yelling,

19:02.600 --> 19:03.893
they're not listening.

19:03.935 --> 19:06.479
Lois, our situation

19:03.935 --> 19:06.479
is difficult enough

19:06.520 --> 19:10.566
without me adding

19:06.520 --> 19:10.566
a bunch of negativity to it.

19:10.608 --> 19:13.193
What situation? You mean Stevie?

19:13.235 --> 19:15.488
He's fine!

19:13.235 --> 19:15.488
He's not going to wither away

19:15.529 --> 19:18.407
because you blow off steam

19:15.529 --> 19:18.407
every once in a while.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.286
Hey, why don't you give

19:20.242 --> 19:22.286
both of you a break?

19:25.247 --> 19:26.373
Go ahead, hit me.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.875
Get it over with.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.799
Ow... ow...

19:34.841 --> 19:37.677
Let me... help you.

19:39.261 --> 19:41.514
Reap...

19:41.555 --> 19:43.182
the whirlwind!

19:44.266 --> 19:45.601
(grunting)

19:45.643 --> 19:49.229
Finally-- justice.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.732
I mean, if he doesn't kill him.

19:51.774 --> 19:52.984
(grunting)

19:55.486 --> 19:58.238
Stevie, what the hell

19:55.486 --> 19:58.238
do you think you're doing?!

19:58.280 --> 19:59.657
You are in so

19:58.280 --> 19:59.657
much trouble!

19:59.699 --> 20:01.492
This behavior is

19:59.699 --> 20:01.492
totally unacceptable.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.162
We are at a restaurant--

20:01.534 --> 20:04.162
what is wrong with you?

20:05.287 --> 20:06.706
Don't you take that tone

20:05.287 --> 20:06.706
with me!

20:06.747 --> 20:08.332
You just wait

20:06.747 --> 20:08.332
till we get home!

20:08.374 --> 20:09.876
He bruised the bone.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.251
Oh, like you

20:09.917 --> 20:11.251
didn't deserve it.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.879
Good for you! I knew

20:11.293 --> 20:12.879
you had it in you.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.254
Shut your trap!

20:14.296 --> 20:16.549
Excuse me, would

20:14.296 --> 20:16.549
you mind please

20:14.296 --> 20:16.549
keeping it down?

20:16.590 --> 20:18.134
Would you mind

20:16.590 --> 20:18.134
going to hell?

20:18.176 --> 20:19.886
And I absolutely did order tea!

20:19.927 --> 20:23.263
How hard is it to remember

20:19.927 --> 20:23.263
a stupid drink order, you idiot?

20:23.305 --> 20:24.849
Kitty, there's going to be

20:23.305 --> 20:24.849
some changes...

20:24.891 --> 20:27.267
And you-- Mr. Ho Hos

20:24.891 --> 20:27.267
in his sock drawer!

20:27.309 --> 20:28.686
Who do you think

20:27.309 --> 20:28.686
you're kidding?

20:28.728 --> 20:30.312
Honey, you have

20:28.728 --> 20:30.312
to pace yourself.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.190
And another thing,

20:30.354 --> 20:32.190
Don Juan,

20:32.272 --> 20:34.108
there are two people

20:32.272 --> 20:34.108
in that bed!

20:35.401 --> 20:37.904
You know, I really don't

20:35.401 --> 20:37.904
feel very good.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.323
And I had it with your poker

20:39.530 --> 20:41.323
nights and your idiot frien...

20:47.329 --> 20:50.791
I think this is

20:47.329 --> 20:50.791
where they nested.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.293
I'd say we got off lucky.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.295
This happened once

20:53.335 --> 20:55.295
before in '72--

20:55.337 --> 20:59.258
we had to bulldoze

20:55.337 --> 20:59.258
the amphitheater.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.305
It's Horton.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.307
Hey, Horton, you okay?

21:07.349 --> 21:09.518
What happened?

21:09.560 --> 21:14.148
I've seen things, Francis...

21:14.190 --> 21:17.568
terrible things...

21:17.610 --> 21:20.238
and I... I think I'm engaged.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.118
Come on, children,

21:23.365 --> 21:25.118
quickly, quickly.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.118
KITTY: Those pants went

21:25.159 --> 21:26.827
out of style in the '80s

21:25.159 --> 21:26.827
and they were ugly back then.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.204
Don't you give me that look.

21:28.246 --> 21:29.329
You got a eye problem?

21:29.371 --> 21:30.998
Whoa. Interesting dinner.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.000
Stevie beat the crap

21:31.040 --> 21:33.000
out of Reese,

21:33.042 --> 21:34.334
his dad got drunk,

21:34.376 --> 21:37.337
and his mom's gone

21:34.376 --> 21:37.337
totally psycho.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.339
Oh, my God... we're contagious.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.425
KITTY:

21:39.381 --> 21:41.425
...the whole night staring

21:39.381 --> 21:41.425
at the cocktail waitress.
