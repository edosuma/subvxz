WEBVTT

06:36.800 --> 06:38.438
Therefore,

06:39.640 --> 06:43.155
by the authority of the almighty God.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.068
of Saint Peter

06:46.280 --> 06:48.589
and Paul and by our Own,

06:49.080 --> 06:51.640
this venerable brother of ours,

06:52.040 --> 06:56.158
we create and solemnly proclaim

06:57.080 --> 07:00.595
of the Holy Roman Church,

07:00.920 --> 07:06.153
Cardinal Bernardo Alonzo Gutierrez.

08:04.640 --> 08:09.270
Receive the ring from the hands of Peter.

08:11.080 --> 08:16.108
And know that through the love
of the Prince of the Apostles

08:16.200 --> 08:22.230
your love for the Church is strengthened.

10:09.760 --> 10:13.196
-Now let us offer the prayer

10:13.920 --> 10:19.711
that Christ has given us as the model
of all prayers.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.392
-Let us pray.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.433
-The Pope told me lwould become a cardinal.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.872
He didn't keep his promise.

12:30.640 --> 12:31.834
I don't know...

12:33.120 --> 12:34.838
This Pope...

12:35.480 --> 12:37.436
This Pope... l...

12:38.920 --> 12:41.150
I don't know... I don't know...

12:42.760 --> 12:44.796
But I know so many things...

12:46.680 --> 12:48.511
If I were to speak...

12:54.520 --> 12:56.078
I don't know...

12:58.840 --> 13:01.308
-And now it's time for me
to bid you all farewell.

13:01.520 --> 13:04.080
I should have done it before,

13:04.240 --> 13:06.959
but the Holy Father kept me in Rome

13:07.040 --> 13:10.669
so I could begin work
on my new responsibilities.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.157
I beg your pardon

13:13.840 --> 13:17.515
for only coming back here
after nine months to...

13:18.240 --> 13:20.151
to say goodbye

13:20.400 --> 13:23.790
and turn right around
and head back to Rome.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.550
But before I leave

13:28.880 --> 13:33.078
I'd like to introduce you to the
new bishop of Dan Pedro Sula,

13:34.400 --> 13:37.039
Monsignor Jorge Aguero.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.398
I know Monsignor Aguero very well.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.672
He's a hero.

13:44.160 --> 13:47.118
From this pulpit he will shout at you

13:48.080 --> 13:53.757
to forsake evil,
to fight against the gangs,

13:54.400 --> 13:56.356
to say no to death,

13:57.120 --> 13:58.678
to violence,

13:58.960 --> 14:02.316
and the narcotrafficking
that infests Honduras.

14:02.720 --> 14:05.996
He will refuse to give communion
to crime bosses

14:06.760 --> 14:10.958
and he will refuse to perform weddings
for their daughters.

14:13.760 --> 14:19.232
Yes, he will do all the things that
l have failed to do.

14:23.400 --> 14:27.393
Yes, because I'm not a hero.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.391
Because”.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.635
I'm afraid.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.989
Like you.

14:41.720 --> 14:46.430
Perhaps that is why you have loved me,
just a little.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.473
No?

14:49.480 --> 14:52.040
Because I didn't make you uncomfortable.

14:52.560 --> 14:56.633
I never asked you to choose.

14:57.880 --> 15:02.078
I never blackmailed you by saying that
in order to be good Christians

15:02.320 --> 15:07.269
you had to let yourselves be murdered
by the henchmen of the drug cartels.

15:11.480 --> 15:17.350
I loved you for the way you were
not for the way you ought to be.

15:21.280 --> 15:24.033
Now I bid you farewell. I'm going to Rome.

15:25.360 --> 15:28.477
But that's not going home for me.

15:30.640 --> 15:34.474
I want you to know that,
as far as I'm concerned,

15:35.280 --> 15:39.512
Honduras is and always will be

15:40.600 --> 15:42.033
my home.

15:44.520 --> 15:45.748
-Attention!

21:26.680 --> 21:31.390
-Mr. Prime Minister, please allow me to
recommend extreme caution with the Pope.

21:31.720 --> 21:36.999
The information I've received suggests
that he's more diabolical than saintly.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.513
-Excellentl

21:39.200 --> 21:40.758
He's finally meeting his match.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.115
Your Eminence!

22:00.200 --> 22:02.634
-Welcome, Mr. Prime Minister, the
Holy Father is expecting you.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.280
-Thanks.
-This way please.

22:09.200 --> 22:10.553
-Good morning.

22:11.920 --> 22:15.674
Good morning. Good morning.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.155
We'll be late for the audience!

22:19.600 --> 22:21.272
Good morning. Good morning.

35:54.720 --> 35:58.076
-You weren't all that wrong:
this Pope is diabolical.

36:01.720 --> 36:02.869
Good day.

36:03.360 --> 36:05.078
This Pope is a saint.

36:05.520 --> 36:08.557
I can say that much after my meeting
with the Holy Father.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.031
A warm, productive and stimulating meeting.

36:12.240 --> 36:16.791
Nonetheless, substantial disagreements
remain with the Holy See.

36:17.360 --> 36:21.069
The Italian government,
despite the Pontiff's misgivings,

36:21.280 --> 36:24.431
will continue the efforts to legalize
common law marriages,

36:24.600 --> 36:27.273
no matter what the sexual orientation is.

36:28.440 --> 36:32.228
And, as you know, the revision of the eight
per thousand church tax is approaching

36:32.320 --> 36:34.595
and will be the subject of our
next cabinet meeting.

45:00.960 --> 45:02.154
-Oh Jesus!

45:02.720 --> 45:06.759
-Who sent you? Pios Xlll?
-No, Raffaele Esposito the magistrate.

45:06.840 --> 45:09.877
Captain Becchi is here and, he would like
to ask you a few questions.

45:09.960 --> 45:13.032
-And I'll be happy to provide
him with some answers.

45:17.640 --> 45:19.073
-This is for you.

45:20.440 --> 45:22.112
Read it!

45:34.520 --> 45:36.158
-What do you recommend?

45:36.840 --> 45:41.516
-Father Antonello did a greatjob with
"A Great Little Soul"

45:41.600 --> 45:43.989
So did Liliana with "A Man"...

45:47.240 --> 45:52.314
-l'll take "1001 Illustrious Names
Blackmailed by Angelo Voiello."

45:55.840 --> 45:58.195
-There, only there.

46:04.320 --> 46:05.912
-May l have some cane sugar?

46:06.000 --> 46:08.230
-We don't have any cane sugar, Captain.

46:08.320 --> 46:12.199
-Eminence, do you have any idea
why I'm here?

46:12.440 --> 46:15.398
-The owner of the
"Er Core de Roma" restaurant

46:15.480 --> 46:17.596
must have filed a complaint against me.

46:18.120 --> 46:22.830
Last week he claimed that Maradona is still
on drugs, and I really lashed out at him.

46:22.920 --> 46:28.790
I said, "You ugly shit, don't you dare take
the Lord's name in vain again."

46:28.880 --> 46:32.668
-No, Your Eminence, we're here about
Tonino Pettola. Do you know him?

46:33.280 --> 46:36.033
-Who?
-Tonino Pettola.

46:36.880 --> 46:41.351
-Ah, yes. Of course, I know his reputation.

46:41.560 --> 46:45.633
a lousy reputation, let me add.
He's a notorious con artist

46:45.720 --> 46:49.918
who claims he can pick out the
Blessed Virgin Mary amid his flock of sheep.

46:50.640 --> 46:52.949
The Congregation for the Causes of Saints
has repeatedly

46:53.080 --> 46:55.230
and vehemently rejected his applications.

46:55.400 --> 46:57.356
-Have you ever met him personally?

46:58.240 --> 46:59.559
-Never.

47:00.480 --> 47:02.914
-Petto|a's relatives claim the exact opposite.

47:03.280 --> 47:08.593
They say that Tonino Pettola
one evening a few months ago in his home

47:08.760 --> 47:12.150
met with you, the Pope and other Cardinals.

47:12.240 --> 47:16.028
From that moment on he seemed shocked
and obsessed with your meeting

47:16.120 --> 47:21.069
because they say that you
threatened to throw him in quicksand.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.911
-Does it strike you as plausible, Captain,

47:24.200 --> 47:26.350
that the Cardinals, the Secretary of State and

47:26.440 --> 47:28.795
the Pope would all go
to Tonino Pettola's house

47:29.280 --> 47:31.714
and threaten to throw him in quicksand?

47:31.800 --> 47:33.518
-It does seem strange

47:34.800 --> 47:36.518
but not implausible.

47:36.600 --> 47:40.434
-Why? What happened to Tonino Pettola?
-He disappeared.

47:40.800 --> 47:46.557
His relatives claim he was being persecuted
by persons high up in the Vatican.

47:46.800 --> 47:51.078
Do you really think we'd waste our time
on a poor raving lunatic?

47:51.160 --> 47:54.152
-That poor man had followers
all around the world

47:54.240 --> 47:56.629
and was about to found his own Church.

47:56.720 --> 48:00.156
-He's not the only one, Captain.
At least two crazies pop up every day.

48:00.240 --> 48:02.993
If the Vatican were to persecute
and threaten them all,

48:03.560 --> 48:05.152
it wouldn't have time to do anything else.

48:05.240 --> 48:12.078
-Phone records reveal that numerous calls
from inside the Vatican were made to Pettola.

48:12.640 --> 48:16.679
-I believe it. People are always making
calls from the Vatican.

48:16.960 --> 48:20.032
I've been fighting for years
against such wasteful behavior.

48:20.120 --> 48:23.078
-Waste is not the point, Your Eminence.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.755
Don't you think it's a contradiction?

48:25.880 --> 48:29.998
lf Pettola was an insignificant con artist
and you had no interest in him,

48:30.240 --> 48:31.878
why all the phone calls?

48:32.040 --> 48:34.918
-The Congregation for the Causes of Saints
was in contact with him,

48:35.000 --> 48:38.072
doing their best to check
his urgent demands.

48:38.160 --> 48:43.188
-The calls not only came from the
Congregation for the Causes of Saints

48:43.280 --> 48:47.910
but also from Your Eminence's offices
and from the Pope's.

48:48.360 --> 48:53.559
-In the Secretary of State and the Pope's
offices there are about 250 employees.

48:54.000 --> 48:59.711
I can't rule out that someone might have
had a reason to call Tonino Pettola.

49:00.240 --> 49:04.597
Perhaps someone that believed all his fibs
and wanted to meet him.

49:04.680 --> 49:08.195
-Do you have any idea where
Tonino Pettola might be?

49:08.360 --> 49:11.352
-He's probably in some far-flung monastery

49:11.520 --> 49:13.875
praying and repenting.

49:13.960 --> 49:17.396
-You have an answer for everything,
Eminence.

49:17.720 --> 49:20.359
-That's myjob, Captain.

49:27.760 --> 49:30.115
-|'ve heard the same thing.

49:30.560 --> 49:34.473
-What, Captain?
-That Maradona is still doing drugs.

49:34.560 --> 49:38.872
A friend of mine told me. He's in intelligence
and stationed in Dubai.

49:40.760 --> 49:44.389
-Why do you want to hurt me, Captain? Why?

49:46.240 --> 49:50.472
-Because I'm a fan of lnter, Your Eminence.
