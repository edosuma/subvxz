[Burnham]
<i>Previously on</i> Star Trek: Discovery:

00:14.597 --> 00:16.725
That's a Federation distress signal.

00:16.808 --> 00:20.478
A distress signal must include
an encoded message of some kind.

00:20.562 --> 00:23.398
Adira can write an algorithm
that can decode it.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.483
Update me the moment you have something.

00:26.109 --> 00:30.822
What the Federation's done for us,
for other worlds like ours, I want in.

00:30.905 --> 00:33.742
Well, you'll have to speak
to Captain Saru,

00:33.825 --> 00:36.661
and clarify your intentions
aboard his starship.

00:36.745 --> 00:37.579
Aye, aye.

00:37.662 --> 00:39.122
-One aye.
-One aye, yeah.

00:39.205 --> 00:42.500
I would like you to serve
as my acting first officer.

00:43.501 --> 00:45.128
Saru made the right choice.

00:46.004 --> 00:49.674
The sphere data was transmitted here
for us to protect it.

00:49.758 --> 00:52.761
[computer]
<i>Your crew requires R&R, captain.</i>

00:52.844 --> 00:57.223
Perhaps now, it desires to protect us.

00:57.974 --> 00:59.142
She's redlining.

01:00.101 --> 01:01.394
I'm dying.

01:01.478 --> 01:02.771
It's not that cut and dry.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.147
[dramatic music playing]

01:10.445 --> 01:13.490
[Kovich] If you'd come to me sooner,
I could have saved you a lot of trouble.

01:14.157 --> 01:19.871
-I wasn't aware you had medical training.
-I'm a man of widely varying interests.

01:21.039 --> 01:24.876
I understand she's been presenting
with physiological symptoms,

01:24.959 --> 01:28.338
but the cure won't be found
anywhere in this room,

01:28.421 --> 01:30.215
or in this galaxy, for that matter.

01:30.298 --> 01:34.302
Computer, open classified file
Beta-4895-Omega.

01:37.222 --> 01:40.016
Lieutenant Commander Yor, deceased.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.101
-Time soldier.
-Time soldier?

01:42.185 --> 01:44.854
You're lucky you skipped
the Temporal Wars.

01:44.938 --> 01:49.067
Amongst the many horrible things
we discovered when weaponizing time,

01:49.150 --> 01:51.402
temporal travel can make you sick.

01:51.486 --> 01:55.240
Our molecules are designed to function
in the time in which they're created.

01:55.323 --> 01:57.867
But everyone on <i>Discovery</i>
traveled through time.

01:57.951 --> 02:01.079
Yes, but only one of you
is also from a parallel universe.

02:01.704 --> 02:05.416
Yor here traveled forward from 2379

02:05.500 --> 02:09.087
and across from an alternate universe
created by the temporal incursion

02:09.170 --> 02:10.755
of a Romulan mining ship.

02:10.839 --> 02:14.676
Before Georgiou,
Yor was the only individual known

02:14.759 --> 02:17.595
to have traveled across
both time and dimensions.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.014
-You knew this would happen to her?
-Suspected.

02:20.557 --> 02:24.269
Every molecule fights
to either go back in time

02:24.811 --> 02:26.312
or jump a cosmic divide.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.982
By the end, Yor was in such pain,

02:29.065 --> 02:32.360
the doctors petitioned the Federation
for euthanasia.

02:32.443 --> 02:34.863
They couldn't send him back
to his own universe?

02:34.946 --> 02:38.074
Not without breaking the Interdimensional
Displacement Restriction...

02:39.242 --> 02:42.829
part of the Temporal Accords,
which are ironclad.

02:43.705 --> 02:47.250
But Georgiou didn't get sick
when she first crossed to prime.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.460
Nine hundred years have passed.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.964
The prime and mirror universes
have been drifting apart.

02:53.047 --> 02:56.384
Yor's experience was a breeze compared
with what Georgiou's about to face.

02:57.552 --> 02:58.511
Well, thank you.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.265
-I'll tell her what's happening.
-No, you won't.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.059
A dying Terran's basic instinct

03:05.143 --> 03:08.479
is to find a way to die in battle,
the more glorious the better.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.316
You wanna set that loose on your ship?

03:12.066 --> 03:16.821
The best thing you could do is sedate her
and put her in a comfortable cell.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.032
Computer, incorporating new data,

03:19.115 --> 03:21.284
is there another solution
to help Georgiou?

03:21.784 --> 03:24.746
Include datasets from before we jumped
to the future and after.

03:24.829 --> 03:25.955
This is pointless.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.167
-There is absolutely no--
<i>-There is a solution.</i>

03:31.336 --> 03:32.170
Show us.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.352
[clears throat]

03:48.186 --> 03:51.481
Well, if it isn't Saru's
walking command blunder.

03:51.564 --> 03:54.275
Find a way to kill everyone onboard yet?

03:54.359 --> 03:57.445
Maybe they'll call you "Killy" after all.

04:04.994 --> 04:08.957
If you're struggling with everyday tasks,
we can help you...

04:09.666 --> 04:10.667
privately.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.127
What are you insinuating?

04:13.795 --> 04:15.421
I saw that your hand--

04:15.505 --> 04:18.341
My hand is fine.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.969
-[gasps]
-See?

04:21.386 --> 04:24.889
Where I'm from,
wars would have started over much less.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.724
Thankfully, we're not there.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.018
Culber's asking for you.

04:29.769 --> 04:30.728
[Georgiou] Let me guess.

04:30.812 --> 04:34.190
He has found another way to say
he has no idea what's happening to me.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.025
No, there's been a development.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.151
It won't matter.

04:39.153 --> 04:43.032
If I were you, I'd find a phaser
and put me down like a dog.

04:45.994 --> 04:49.122
[Culber] <i>Apparently, the cure can be found</i>
<i>on Dannus Five.</i>

04:49.914 --> 04:52.250
Every time we query
the sphere data for a treatment,

04:52.750 --> 04:55.253
no matter how we entered it,
it gave us the same result.

04:55.336 --> 04:58.589
But your computer merged
with a sentient intelligence.

04:58.673 --> 05:02.385
It's great for movie night,
doesn't mean we should trust it.

05:02.468 --> 05:05.722
It was bringing the crew together...
helping them.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.765
Maybe it's trying to help one of our own.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.810
<i>Discovery's</i> computer has acquired
all current Federation databases,

05:10.893 --> 05:12.603
in addition to those
from our original time,

05:12.687 --> 05:15.523
databases that were lost
or damaged in the Burn.

05:15.606 --> 05:18.401
It has a scope and context
we can't conceive of.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.696
What are the odds
we're talking about here?

05:21.779 --> 05:24.615
[Culber] According to the computer's
metadata analysis of probabilities,

05:24.699 --> 05:28.119
Georgiou has a 5 percent chance
of survival if we take her there,

05:28.202 --> 05:29.746
zero if we don't.

05:29.829 --> 05:33.708
Emperor Georgiou and I
have not always seen eye to eye,

05:34.542 --> 05:37.295
yet I am sympathetic to her plight.

05:38.463 --> 05:42.050
That said, I regret
that this is an instance

05:42.133 --> 05:45.344
wherein the needs of the many
must outweigh the needs of the one.

05:48.139 --> 05:48.973
Sir?

05:49.057 --> 05:51.726
We have received reports that
the Emerald Chain is about to conduct

05:51.809 --> 05:55.354
the equivalent of military exercises
as they did near Argeth.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.733
The entire fleet is being placed
on yellow alert, commander.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.652
Where is this planet again?

06:02.236 --> 06:04.906
Just shy of the Gamma Quadrant,
near the Galactic Rim.

06:04.989 --> 06:07.158
[suspenseful music playing]

06:07.241 --> 06:08.868
So, nowhere near the Chain.

06:08.951 --> 06:12.580
Georgiou will be a menace
to any civilization she runs across.

06:13.122 --> 06:14.874
Dannus Five is uninhabited.

06:14.957 --> 06:18.377
Well, an uninhabited planet
is better than the brig.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.379
If we don't find a cure there...

06:21.005 --> 06:23.049
I doubt she'll even make it back
to <i>Discovery.</i>

06:29.263 --> 06:31.599
All right. I'll authorize it.

06:33.142 --> 06:36.020
Providing Burnham
can answer a question for me.

06:37.063 --> 06:37.897
Yes, sir.

06:38.773 --> 06:41.609
Will you really be able to let her go,
when it comes down to it?

06:44.320 --> 06:46.280
Because the odds are not good here.

06:46.781 --> 06:49.242
According to your files,
you hesitated last time.

06:49.325 --> 06:50.993
Couldn't make the hard call.

06:52.036 --> 06:55.456
-You're referring to Commander Airiam.
-Your entire crew would have died.

06:56.207 --> 06:58.626
Which is why I will never hesitate again.

07:00.128 --> 07:00.962
Sir.

07:07.135 --> 07:10.471
Disclosure to crew will be need-to-know...

07:11.347 --> 07:12.807
at Captain Saru's discretion.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.143
Dismissed.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.230
[dramatic music playing]

07:22.400 --> 07:24.068
Captain Saru, a word?

07:26.696 --> 07:28.156
Not what you would have done?

07:29.282 --> 07:32.827
Given my understanding
of the Federation's priorities,

07:32.910 --> 07:34.954
I would have made a different choice, yes.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.040
I never listened to...

07:39.834 --> 07:41.878
advice when I was green,

07:41.961 --> 07:44.464
but take it from an old salt who's made...

07:45.506 --> 07:47.758
a lot of bad calls in his day.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.428
A crew member is drowning.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.430
If we let her,

07:52.513 --> 07:56.934
then your crew will never look at you
or the Federation the same way again.

07:59.937 --> 08:02.482
And you will never look at yourself
the same way, either.

08:05.943 --> 08:06.777
Yes, sir.

08:07.987 --> 08:08.821
And...

08:09.864 --> 08:11.199
thank you, sir.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.409
We'll deal with the Chain.

08:14.785 --> 08:16.120
See you when you get back.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.505
-[Burnham] Georgiou.
-[grunting]

08:28.382 --> 08:29.842
Phillipa, I'm talking to you.

08:29.926 --> 08:30.760
[yells]

08:32.553 --> 08:36.224
Planet in the middle of nowhere.
Barely any chance there's anything there

08:36.307 --> 08:39.018
and being sent there
by a sentient computer

08:39.101 --> 08:40.478
with a sense of humor.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.980
What am I missing?

08:43.064 --> 08:45.274
Maybe we'll find something
that can help you.

08:45.650 --> 08:46.943
Enough of your help.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.530
Your help is useless.

08:50.613 --> 08:51.989
[both grunting]

08:52.073 --> 08:54.242
[dramatic music playing]

08:59.789 --> 09:01.499
Fight me!

09:02.500 --> 09:04.377
This is the coward's way out.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.797
You know I would never hurt you.

09:10.466 --> 09:11.300
[grunts]

09:13.052 --> 09:14.136
Then you will die.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.348
[yells]

09:20.351 --> 09:25.231
Killing me would have been
the greatest honor of my Burnham's life.

09:25.314 --> 09:28.484
It would have been my greatest honor
to have been killed by her.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.735
Sorry to disappoint.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.905
A Terran greets death every morning.

09:32.989 --> 09:36.784
Being ill simply means
that my birthday is arriving sooner.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.371
You're never gonna get the death
you want here.

09:41.205 --> 09:42.415
You'll be a study...

09:43.708 --> 09:45.626
just a point of reference.

09:47.378 --> 09:48.296
You want honor?

09:50.047 --> 09:50.965
It's out there.

09:51.048 --> 09:53.092
[suspenseful music playing]

09:53.175 --> 09:55.595
No more tests, or poking or prodding.

09:55.678 --> 09:56.804
Just you and me...

09:58.222 --> 10:00.600
and whatever is waiting for you
on that planet.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.810
In my universe...

10:03.603 --> 10:06.230
I plucked you off a rubbish heap.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.398
How kind of you.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.569
You think you are so different from her.

10:14.113 --> 10:17.074
You have the same need
to bend people to your will.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.659
The only difference...

10:19.535 --> 10:22.705
is that you lie about it to yourself.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.041
Does all that mean you're coming?

10:30.338 --> 10:34.258
Lead me to my death, Angel Michael.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.968
Hold out your wrist.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.014
-What is that?
-Death's alarm clock.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.350
Dr. Culber wants you to wear it.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.727
It's a bio-scanner to monitor
your condition.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.812
Let's hope it doesn't get to red.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.105
[bio-scanner chimes]

10:48.564 --> 10:49.523
It's hideous.

10:49.607 --> 10:50.524
Wear it anyway.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.320
And get ready,
we're about to go to black alert.

10:57.740 --> 11:01.118
[theme music playing]

12:32.334 --> 12:34.753
[Burnham]
<i>Bridge says we've arrived at Dannus Five.</i>

12:34.837 --> 12:36.630
Preparing to meet an army down there?

12:36.714 --> 12:38.007
One can hope.

12:38.090 --> 12:42.720
Those who I will take with me in battle
will be my servants in the afterlife.

12:44.972 --> 12:47.057
I never thought I'd get you
to keep that on your wrist.

12:47.141 --> 12:50.436
Well, I'll let it fall off
the next time it flickers away.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.982
Saru, come to see me off?

12:56.066 --> 12:57.902
How nice that you'll be rid of me.

12:57.985 --> 13:00.112
I do hope for the best of outcomes,

13:00.196 --> 13:03.532
but thankfully, you and I
have never had to parse words

13:03.616 --> 13:05.034
with one another.

13:06.744 --> 13:10.247
I fear this may be the last we see of you,
and I want you to know that

13:11.123 --> 13:15.294
I have learned as much from you
as I learned from our prime, Georgiou.

13:15.377 --> 13:16.378
Where I'm from...

13:17.421 --> 13:20.007
we were prime, and you were the mirror.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.301
As it should be.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.887
Good luck, emperor.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.891
Thank you... captain.

13:31.060 --> 13:35.397
Number One, I expect your crew
may survive you after all.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.069
You've been good for me... weirdly.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.404
[dramatic music playing]

13:49.161 --> 13:49.995
Good luck.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.793
Let's go, shall we?

14:06.178 --> 14:07.513
Where the hell are we?

14:08.055 --> 14:10.015
Right where the sphere data
told us to be...

14:10.724 --> 14:13.060
-but I've never seen a planet look so--
-Empty?

14:14.228 --> 14:15.563
Perfect place to die.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.607
Okay, we're here. Now what?

14:22.236 --> 14:24.071
Says we're supposed to go this way.

14:24.154 --> 14:26.824
[suspenseful music playing]

14:32.413 --> 14:35.541
Come on, you're a distress call.
You want to be heard.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.459
[computer chiming]

14:37.543 --> 14:40.296
Hey. Hey, that's sensitive equipment.

14:41.213 --> 14:42.339
Sorry, sorry.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.967
I take it that the algorithm
is still stuck?

14:45.467 --> 14:46.969
It's been like that for hours.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.681
-Did you do a diagnostic?
-I did ten.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.893
No, wait. You forgot to reinitiate.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.561
No, I didn't.

14:55.644 --> 14:58.272
You paused the algorithm
when you put in a new storage array.

14:58.355 --> 15:01.191
You need to restart it again.
See? Right here.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.072
[computer chimes]

15:10.576 --> 15:12.328
I just cost us so much time.

15:16.373 --> 15:17.207
You're tired.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.418
You haven't slept.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.212
You're angry with Gray.

15:22.296 --> 15:25.090
Uh, I'm not angry. [scoffs]

15:25.174 --> 15:27.760
-It's okay to miss him.
-I don't miss him.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.971
The last few weeks have been great.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.891
Yeah, I am enjoying my life without him

15:33.974 --> 15:35.434
and if he was here right now,

15:35.517 --> 15:37.811
I would thank him
for leaving without a word.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.439
Maybe he's doing what he thinks is best.

15:42.524 --> 15:46.820
He did say that he wants you to make ties
with the outside world, right?

15:46.904 --> 15:50.366
Yeah, but he doesn't get to decide
what's good for me.

15:51.867 --> 15:52.701
No.

15:53.786 --> 15:54.662
He doesn't.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.499
[computer] <i>Video rendering complete.</i>

15:58.582 --> 16:01.669
[suspenseful music playing]

16:01.752 --> 16:02.711
What the--?

16:03.629 --> 16:04.964
[gasps] Is that--?

16:05.047 --> 16:06.048
Go find Saru.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.425
Okay. Um...

16:08.509 --> 16:09.343
Yeah, okay.

16:10.719 --> 16:12.513
[Booker] Hey, captain, a word?

16:13.013 --> 16:15.349
If you do not mind talking
on the move, Mr. Booker.

16:15.975 --> 16:20.396
Yeah, sure. Look, I wanna thank you again
for what you did on Kwejian.

16:20.479 --> 16:23.732
No need. It's the reason
for the Federation's existence.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.442
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.945
-I think I can help you.
-Help?

16:28.028 --> 16:30.572
I wanna stick around for a bit
and I plan to earn my way.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.951
I'm not sure if you heard,
but I'm a skilled pilot, an engineer,

16:34.034 --> 16:35.953
and I have information.

16:36.870 --> 16:37.705
I'm listening.

16:37.788 --> 16:42.668
I'm hearing the Emerald Chain is getting
ready for, uh, "training exercises."

16:42.751 --> 16:45.462
Only most times... it's not the training.

16:45.546 --> 16:48.007
That confirms intelligence
we've already received.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.801
-Who are your sources?
-Couriers.

16:52.052 --> 16:54.722
Can't say who,
but it does confirm your own intel.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.682
So, let me keep at it, yeah?

16:57.433 --> 16:59.852
I have no doubt
you are a man of many resources,

16:59.935 --> 17:02.813
but this is the United Federation
of Planets.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.273
We have a way of doing things.

17:04.356 --> 17:08.193
We must lean on protocol
when situations are unclear.

17:08.277 --> 17:13.449
So, you want me to sit back, relax,
and read the field manual?

17:13.532 --> 17:16.076
-You may find it informative.
-How exciting.

17:17.369 --> 17:21.498
When we first arrived,
I too was eager to assist.

17:21.582 --> 17:26.420
Ultimately, we had to wait
for our moment to prove ourselves.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.716
I trust you will find your moment as well,
Mr. Booker.

17:35.971 --> 17:38.974
[dramatic music playing]

17:40.809 --> 17:43.103
[Burnham]
We're gonna find it, whatever it is.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.813
We're not leaving here without a solution.

17:45.522 --> 17:48.400
My Burnham wouldn't have bothered
trying to make me feel better.

17:48.484 --> 17:51.403
-She'd have found a solution already.
-Is that so?

17:53.363 --> 17:55.991
Tell me something, Philippa. Why her?

17:56.075 --> 17:57.034
What?

17:58.619 --> 18:01.622
Why did you pick her...
off the rubbish heap?

18:01.705 --> 18:02.706
Hm.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.377
All the other children
came running hands out, pleading.

18:07.461 --> 18:10.339
You stayed on the heap,
prepared to be your own salvation.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.800
Sounds nice, but that's
your Michael Burnham, not me.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.677
[scoffs] Well, that's the part
to make the gods laugh, isn't it?

18:15.761 --> 18:17.471
You won't give me a suitable death

18:17.554 --> 18:21.308
because you're trying to save someone
who's already dead.

18:22.476 --> 18:25.354
Perhaps I should join
your Philippa in hell.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.567
Things don't always have to be
so hard between us.

18:31.527 --> 18:35.531
It doesn't always have to be a fishing
expedition to make you feel better.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.741
You're antagonizing me
because you killed her,

18:37.825 --> 18:39.827
-and you regret it.
-I'm antagonizing you

18:39.910 --> 18:42.746
because you're not her and I regret that.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.251
We followed the damn directions.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.336
-What are we doing here?
-I'm picking up a--

18:50.629 --> 18:52.881
-It's not a life sign, but--
-Where?

18:52.965 --> 18:55.759
[suspenseful music playing]

18:55.843 --> 18:58.011
Looks like right here.

19:01.932 --> 19:02.850
[man] Hm.

19:03.684 --> 19:04.893
Well, look at that.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.604
I was just reading about you.

19:09.148 --> 19:13.068
Emperor Georgiou
dies horribly painful death.

19:14.444 --> 19:15.404
Jeez, you know.

19:16.405 --> 19:17.781
Read all about it, huh?

19:17.865 --> 19:19.700
What the hell is this?

19:19.783 --> 19:21.618
This is obviously...

19:23.078 --> 19:24.079
this.

19:24.746 --> 19:25.998
Who are you?

19:26.081 --> 19:27.875
And what are you doing here?

19:29.960 --> 19:31.753
I'm, uh...

19:31.837 --> 19:35.215
I'm Carl, and you're asking
the wrong questions.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.050
Fine. What is that?

19:38.010 --> 19:40.053
What do you call a cute portal?

19:41.430 --> 19:42.598
"A-door-able."

19:43.390 --> 19:45.642
A clown held a door open for me.

19:45.726 --> 19:48.687
It was a nice jester.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.231
No sense of humor, huh?

19:51.940 --> 19:53.775
Why is it here?

19:53.859 --> 19:55.611
So she can go through.

19:56.403 --> 19:59.865
Maybe you should have studied up
on doors a little.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.409
Where does it lead?

20:02.492 --> 20:04.369
It doesn't lead, it follows.

20:04.453 --> 20:07.873
The cure to all your ills
could be through here. Who knows?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.173
No radiation.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.552
No energy signature.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

20:20.636 --> 20:21.637
Hm.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.764
It doesn't really register at all.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.059
[groans]

20:28.268 --> 20:29.144
Philippa?

20:29.228 --> 20:30.145
[grunting]

20:30.229 --> 20:32.898
-Did you do that?
-It's not my work.

20:32.981 --> 20:36.026
We're here for a reason,
so do something. Help her.

20:36.735 --> 20:37.778
[groans]

20:37.861 --> 20:41.657
You're antagonizing me
because you're pissed at her.

20:43.116 --> 20:43.951
Am I right?

20:46.578 --> 20:47.829
[bio-scanner beeping]

20:47.913 --> 20:49.915
[grunting]

20:56.296 --> 20:58.548
You really should just read the paper.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.593
Everything you need is right here.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.679
That infernal paper says I'm dead.

21:05.138 --> 21:09.351
-But I'm still very much alive.
-That's because this is tomorrow's news.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.938
You're still very much alive today.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.231
But by all means...

21:14.982 --> 21:17.276
-continue wasting time.

The message is over a hundred years old,
made some time after the crash.

22:11.663 --> 22:15.000
It has to have been at least
a few years before the Burn.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.893
The Khi'eth is still broadcasting
this distress signal?

22:32.976 --> 22:33.977
On a loop, sir.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.022
It's amazing their systems
are still working.

22:37.105 --> 22:40.150
Their ship must have retained
some semblance of...

22:41.234 --> 22:42.277

I wanna know what is happening

22:44.112 --> 22:47.407
Oh, we have the prefix code
to the onboard sensors.

Let us wait until we have something
more substantive to report.

The answer follows the question.

23:36.456 --> 23:38.625
It's dangerous if it goes the other way.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.544
Is this the cure?

23:40.627 --> 23:42.838
Goodness gracious. Is she sick?

-No.

This is the chance.

This is the chance your computer
was pointing us to, and I'm taking it.

Fair warning. Your lovely bracelet
will remain safely in the green,

Imperial Command from <i>Discovery,</i>
the emperor is safely arrived.

25:42.082 --> 25:44.918
Emperor, it is truly an honor
to have you aboard.

25:45.001 --> 25:47.671
Once we break Terra's orbit,
we'll be off on our journey.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.548
Emperor.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.636
Yes, Captain Killy.

25:55.178 --> 25:57.597
Do you need to refresh
in your stateroom first?

25:59.516 --> 26:02.269
No. I want a full status report.

26:02.352 --> 26:04.020
Tell me everything you know.

26:07.232 --> 26:10.277
We've received reports of discontent
in the outer sectors.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.363
Insurrection among the slave systems.
You know how slaves are.

26:14.572 --> 26:15.699
The first uprising.

26:17.033 --> 26:20.453
Not to worry. We've sent out fleet ships
to deal with the unrest.

26:20.537 --> 26:24.165
Any civilizations that don't come to heel
will be destroyed.

26:25.667 --> 26:26.501
I see.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.296
And what about our journey?

26:30.755 --> 26:32.674
Once we're outside
the Terran defense grid,

26:32.757 --> 26:34.301
we'll set out at maximum warp.

26:34.384 --> 26:38.221
We'll arrive at the Imperial Shipyard
at Epsilon Indi IV within a few hours.

26:39.514 --> 26:40.807
Imperial Shipyard.

26:41.599 --> 26:42.475
This is--

26:43.184 --> 26:45.228
This is the day we christen the <i>Charon.</i>

26:48.857 --> 26:49.733
This is--

26:50.442 --> 26:52.736
This is the day Lorca betrays me.

26:52.819 --> 26:54.195
He's plotting a coup...

26:55.905 --> 26:56.865
as you are aware.

26:56.948 --> 26:59.701
You must know I'd have nothing to do
with a plot against you.

26:59.784 --> 27:00.869
Of course not.

27:00.952 --> 27:03.538
If I thought so, I wouldn't ask,
and you'd be dead.

27:03.621 --> 27:05.290
Tell me what you've learned.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.835
I was waiting to speak to you
somewhere more private.

27:08.918 --> 27:10.545
The honor guard can be trusted.

27:14.257 --> 27:15.091
Very well.

27:15.717 --> 27:18.762
You are correct.
There is a plot against you. Lorca.

27:19.637 --> 27:22.557
He's inciting violence,
claiming that you've authorized arrests

27:22.640 --> 27:25.185
and executions
for unproven acts of sedition.

27:25.977 --> 27:28.021
And now he wants me dead.

27:28.104 --> 27:29.564
So it would seem.

27:31.149 --> 27:31.983
And, um...

27:32.734 --> 27:34.319
Well, there is more but...

27:39.282 --> 27:42.619
You wish to inform me
that Michael has betrayed me.

27:45.747 --> 27:48.208
They are sleeping together.
I already know that.

27:51.211 --> 27:52.712
And today is the day...

27:53.838 --> 27:57.300
she will try to take my throne
and my life.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.720
Emperor, this is high treason.

28:00.804 --> 28:01.888
I will handle it.

28:02.639 --> 28:05.308
Imperial law is clear
on the act of treason.

28:05.392 --> 28:08.603
Death is mandated regardless
of a perpetrator's relationship...

28:08.686 --> 28:10.688
Let me make myself clear.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.440
Lorca's coup will fail,

28:12.524 --> 28:14.442
Michael will return to the fold,

28:14.526 --> 28:16.986
and the path of what has been
set in motion will change

28:17.070 --> 28:18.780
because I will change it!

28:21.241 --> 28:22.784
My apologies, emperor.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.829
You know I seek only to protect you.

28:26.496 --> 28:28.832
I must tell you that if this situation
were known,

28:28.915 --> 28:31.209
you would risk losing
the trust of your loyalists.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.878
And they will show you no mercy.

28:34.796 --> 28:38.883
Then I will need you to make certain
that it is not known by anyone.

28:39.634 --> 28:42.053
I will not die today.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.388
I know Michael.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.684
It is not too late for her
to make a different choice.

29:27.182 --> 29:32.061

Dominus of Qo'noS, Regina Andor,

Augustus laponius Centarius.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.651
[all] To the empire!

29:38.735 --> 29:43.907
Long live her Imperial Majesty,
Emperor Philippa Georgiou!

29:45.533 --> 29:47.535
Long live the empire!

29:52.123 --> 29:53.416
[door opens]

30:02.842 --> 30:03.927
Hello, Mother.

30:04.636 --> 30:07.639
[dramatic music playing]

30:14.562 --> 30:16.439
It's so good to see you.

30:24.989 --> 30:25.949
I've missed you.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.827
How long has it been? Six months?

30:28.910 --> 30:30.787
Feels like much longer.

30:30.870 --> 30:31.704
Yes.

30:32.288 --> 30:35.458
You were recently on a mission
to Kepler-174 d.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.418
I remember scouting that planet.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.087
It was quite beautiful.

30:39.587 --> 30:41.798
Yes, the flora, the architecture.

30:42.715 --> 30:45.009
I visited the family of artists
you mentioned.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.388
Their paintings and sculptures
are sublime.

30:49.013 --> 30:51.099
-None like them anywhere.
-Truly.

30:51.808 --> 30:53.184
They will be more appreciated

30:53.268 --> 30:55.854
now that I've blinded the artists
and removed their hands.

30:58.398 --> 31:01.359
What survives of their art
will only increase in value.

31:03.319 --> 31:06.155
I'd forgotten how thorough you can be.

31:07.282 --> 31:08.116
Hm.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.744
[Georgiou] Despite your triumphs,

31:11.828 --> 31:12.954
you seem troubled.

31:13.663 --> 31:15.164
[Burnham] Oh, what could be troubling?

31:15.915 --> 31:18.710
Profits are up.
Our grip is stronger than ever.

31:18.793 --> 31:22.922
I'm merely saying you've always
been able to bring your cares to me.

31:23.506 --> 31:26.968
No matter what they are,
we can talk about them.

31:28.595 --> 31:29.971
My cares are simple.

31:31.681 --> 31:33.349
When you prosper, I prosper.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.436
When you're happy, I'm happy.

31:36.519 --> 31:37.812
[clattering]

31:37.896 --> 31:40.023
Clumsy bastard!

31:40.106 --> 31:42.984
Did you just spill kuur sauce on my boots?

31:43.067 --> 31:44.944
[Kelpien] I'm so-- I'm sorry.

31:45.028 --> 31:45.987
I am sorry.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.071
Did you?!

31:49.032 --> 31:52.785
This one's ripe for the plucking.
Have him sent to the butcher!

31:54.370 --> 31:55.830
We'll have fresh soup tomorrow.

31:56.873 --> 32:00.168
Fear not. Your pain will be over soon.

32:02.795 --> 32:04.172
The madness will not take you.

32:05.673 --> 32:07.634
-Can you stand?
-Yes.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.386
I'm sorry, commander. My comrade is ill.

32:11.012 --> 32:13.640
I will see that another servant
attends to you immediately.

32:14.515 --> 32:17.101
-Can you believe these things?
-[guard] Let's go, Kelpien.

32:20.688 --> 32:23.608
Kelpiens. What a waste of evolution.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.860
We should kill them all.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.864
Michael, have you heard?

32:29.948 --> 32:31.574
It seems Captain Lorca...

32:32.325 --> 32:34.035
is moving against me.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.119
Lorca?

32:36.454 --> 32:37.330
[scoffs]

32:38.790 --> 32:41.167
If he is,
he's aiming well above his station.

32:42.418 --> 32:45.213
When was the last time
you had contact with him?

32:46.881 --> 32:50.093
I slept with him a few times last year,
but I quickly grew bored.

32:51.344 --> 32:53.805
You can't hide your feelings from me,
you know.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.393
It's always better to tell the truth.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.478
The truth is easy.

33:02.730 --> 33:05.358
Anyone who betrays the empire
deserves death.

33:06.901 --> 33:08.361
I couldn't agree more.

33:10.488 --> 33:11.781
Master.

33:11.864 --> 33:13.282
Did I call...

33:14.367 --> 33:15.201
for wine?!

33:16.452 --> 33:17.453
Did the emperor?

33:19.789 --> 33:21.833
I saw what you did, slave.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.210
You dared speak...

33:25.253 --> 33:27.171
to an officer of the empire?

33:28.256 --> 33:29.799
I-- I'm sorry, master.

33:29.882 --> 33:31.801
You'll join your friend,

33:31.884 --> 33:34.762
and your ganglia
will be sweetened for dessert.

33:35.805 --> 33:36.848
-Take him!
-No!

33:44.105 --> 33:46.733
This Kelpien is your slave.

33:47.358 --> 33:50.653
You gave him to me yourself, Mother.

33:52.739 --> 33:54.866
Well, I'm taking him back.

33:55.742 --> 33:56.951
When I'm finished...

33:58.327 --> 34:00.288
he will wish he were dead,

34:00.371 --> 34:04.208
but his service
will reach the level of art.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.252
[haunting music playing]

34:14.010 --> 34:14.886
You may speak.

34:18.014 --> 34:22.185
Thank you for the chance to serve.
I will endeavor to learn the proper ways.

34:23.561 --> 34:26.439
It seems you are already quite skilled.

34:27.148 --> 34:28.649
This has been my life's work.

34:29.650 --> 34:32.987
Your friend who was ill,
it was the Vahar'ai, wasn't it?

34:35.990 --> 34:37.116
You know Vahar'ai?

34:37.200 --> 34:41.245
It happens before we cull you,
isn't that right?

34:44.040 --> 34:47.627
The cull is your gift to us...
to save us from madness.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.005
For that, we are grateful.

34:51.547 --> 34:54.717
Sometimes, it is good to go a little mad.

34:58.513 --> 35:01.307
Emperor, "Vahar'ai" is a term

35:02.100 --> 35:03.893
we only use amongst ourselves.

35:04.685 --> 35:06.521
There is no need to coarsen your tongue.

35:07.021 --> 35:08.689
I'm surprised you know it at all.

35:09.190 --> 35:10.775
My eyes see all.

35:11.984 --> 35:13.319
My ears hear all.

35:14.403 --> 35:15.279
You honor us.

35:17.073 --> 35:18.908
But perhaps I don't see everything.

35:19.492 --> 35:24.080
There are worlds the slaves are privy to
that even I cannot enter.

35:25.289 --> 35:26.457
So, let me ask you.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.127
Why is my daughter betraying me?

35:29.836 --> 35:31.003
What am I missing?

35:32.004 --> 35:34.340
I'm afraid I do not know what you mean.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.885
You do know what I mean,

35:38.511 --> 35:40.179
and you are not afraid.

35:41.848 --> 35:42.974
Check your ganglia.

35:44.183 --> 35:45.560
Your instincts have spoken.

35:45.643 --> 35:48.980
If you answer me truthfully,
no harm will come to you.

35:49.063 --> 35:52.900
She is plotting to kill me,
perhaps even today.

35:52.984 --> 35:53.818
Why?

35:54.610 --> 35:58.990
What are Michael and Lorca
whispering in the dark?

35:59.532 --> 36:02.535
[suspenseful music playing]

36:03.911 --> 36:06.122
They fear that you have changed.

36:06.998 --> 36:07.915
Go on.

36:07.999 --> 36:12.211
If they knew even that you had learned
the term "Vahar'ai,"

36:12.920 --> 36:14.130
they would be unsettled.

36:14.213 --> 36:16.924
You mean they would smell weakness.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.385
I once overheard a Terran commander say:

36:21.095 --> 36:24.140
"There is only one rule
for Terrans in this world.

36:24.223 --> 36:26.976
He who sheds the most blood
makes the laws."

36:27.476 --> 36:29.979
Everything I have seen
confirms that to be true.

36:31.397 --> 36:34.817
She cannot love what is weak.
Not if she is to survive.

36:36.652 --> 36:39.155
From now on, you will be my eyes and ears.

36:39.238 --> 36:41.782
What unfolds from here is not up to her.

that I have more than enough.

You'll need a closed casket when I'm done.

37:35.336 --> 37:37.588
He doesn't really want the job.

37:37.672 --> 37:41.842
He just wants the title and the dominion
of the <i>Charon</i> over the red-light district.

37:47.682 --> 37:48.724
I don't know.

37:48.808 --> 37:51.394

44:06.977 --> 44:09.229
Now tell me what this is really about.

44:09.897 --> 44:10.856
You owe me that.

44:10.939 --> 44:11.774
And why?

44:12.650 --> 44:14.610
Because you plucked me
out of a trash heap?

44:17.863 --> 44:21.950
I was master of that trash heap.

44:23.077 --> 44:25.204
And now I'm nothing.

44:25.788 --> 44:26.830
I'm a tool.

44:27.623 --> 44:31.669
I'm just this reflection of you,
who can never stand on my own.

44:32.169 --> 44:34.171
But Lorca, he loves me for me.

44:36.548 --> 44:38.008
And he honors me...

44:39.718 --> 44:40.886
for me.

44:42.596 --> 44:45.891
I gave you every opportunity!

44:46.558 --> 44:49.019
It didn't have to come to this.

44:49.853 --> 44:51.188
Of course, it did.

44:51.271 --> 44:52.731
You want a confession?

44:54.483 --> 44:55.567
Yeah.

44:55.651 --> 44:57.319
I planned a coup with Lorca.

44:58.445 --> 44:59.988
I betrayed you.

45:02.825 --> 45:04.243
I betrayed you!

45:05.411 --> 45:06.620
And I'd do it again.

45:16.255 --> 45:18.924
So, come on, what are you waiting for?

45:21.135 --> 45:22.636
Execute me, Mother.

45:31.979 --> 45:32.813
Do it.

45:38.610 --> 45:41.613
[dramatic music playing]

46:09.266 --> 46:10.100
No.

46:10.684 --> 46:12.186
That is the easy way,

46:12.269 --> 46:14.354
and I know how that story ends.

46:14.438 --> 46:16.899
You die, I die or both.

46:18.358 --> 46:21.028
But as of this moment...

46:22.404 --> 46:24.823
our future is unwritten.

46:27.868 --> 46:29.870
Let's make it count, shall we?

46:33.665 --> 46:35.167
Take her to the agonizer.

46:35.876 --> 46:38.837
