WEBVTT

00:06.756 --> 00:08.758
-All right, give it a try.
-All right.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.802
[car engine sputters]

00:10.885 --> 00:12.887
You know, Mr. Bennett,
you don't have to do this.

00:12.971 --> 00:15.432
I can just get Colt to check it.

00:15.515 --> 00:19.185
And as I'm saying that
I know why you're checking it.

00:19.936 --> 00:23.440
That's why I like you, Abby.
You're a smart girl.

00:24.441 --> 00:26.317
Except for wanting to marry my son.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.904
-Try it again.
-All right.

00:29.988 --> 00:30.864
[car engine starts]

00:30.947 --> 00:35.368
Oh, my God! What did you do?
Thank you. Yeah!

00:36.953 --> 00:37.996
[laughs]

00:38.997 --> 00:41.374
Loose battery cable.
Nothing to worry about.

00:41.458 --> 00:42.375
[chuckles]

00:42.459 --> 00:43.543
Listen...

00:44.210 --> 00:45.628
I didn't get a chance to tell you

00:45.712 --> 00:48.673
how happy I am
about your big news.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.967
Oh, it's all right.

00:51.050 --> 00:53.678
I mean, between my mom crying
and going for the liquor cabinet,

00:53.762 --> 00:56.139
and my dad screaming at Colt
and going for the gun cabinet,

00:56.973 --> 01:00.268
[chuckles] there wasn't a whole lot
of time for anyone to sneak in,

01:00.351 --> 01:03.313
"Congratulations, Abby."

01:04.147 --> 01:05.231
It's like looking in a mirror.

01:05.315 --> 01:06.649
[chuckles]

01:09.235 --> 01:11.654
You're about the best thing
that's ever happened to this family.

01:13.656 --> 01:14.866
Thank you, Mr. Bennett.

01:14.949 --> 01:16.409
Hi, Dad.

01:16.493 --> 01:19.204
And if you can, try to have a girl.

01:22.499 --> 01:25.710
All right, if we're still best friends,
you just say nothing and keep walking.

01:27.462 --> 01:28.505
[laughs]

01:28.588 --> 01:29.589
Knew it!

01:31.216 --> 01:32.467
You guys gonna be all right?

01:32.550 --> 01:35.970
Oh, yeah, you heard him.
We're still best friends. Here.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.348
-Oh. Oh.
-Uh, I got you that for the road.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.976
I know when you're pregnant,
you got weird cravings,

01:42.060 --> 01:45.522
so I got peanut butter, pickles,
mustard, Skoal...

01:47.482 --> 01:50.819
-Skoal?
-Yeah. You just quit smoking.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.279
So if you get in a bind,
you just put a lip in.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.489
[laughs]

01:54.572 --> 01:55.740
-I'm good.
-Oh,

01:55.824 --> 01:58.535
thank God. That's my last can.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.454
He gives me his last can of chew?

02:01.538 --> 02:02.831
Now that is some real hillbilly love

02:02.914 --> 02:03.998
-right there, Bennett.
-[chuckles]

02:04.082 --> 02:06.626
Come here. Thank you.

02:07.877 --> 02:08.837
Listen, um...

02:09.921 --> 02:13.675
I've been thinking about
the Peterson Ranch, and the baby

02:13.758 --> 02:16.344
and everything, and I... I have an idea.

02:16.427 --> 02:18.304
What if we ask my parents for some money?

02:20.765 --> 02:24.769
Sure. Yeah, your dad hates me,
hates that we're getting married,

02:24.853 --> 02:25.728
just found out you're pregnant.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.064
Well, hell, he's probably on his way
to the bank right now.

02:28.940 --> 02:32.861
Why don't we just run over his dog?
Maybe he'll give us more money.

02:32.944 --> 02:37.282
I know it's a crazy idea,
but I'm his only daughter.

02:37.365 --> 02:40.660
My parents would do anything for me.
It's just...

02:40.743 --> 02:42.453
What... Wait, what's wrong?

02:44.122 --> 02:46.166
You got that look on your face
like when we're at a restaurant

02:46.249 --> 02:48.001
and you're trying to figure out
how much to tip.

02:49.752 --> 02:54.048
What if instead of asking him for help,

02:55.592 --> 02:57.176
you ask him to invest in the ranch?

02:58.261 --> 02:59.929
Well, he makes money too.
Everybody wins.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.099
It's like everything
my dad hates about T-ball.

03:03.808 --> 03:08.354
That is actually a great idea.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.315
Okay, when you say "actually,"

03:10.398 --> 03:12.442
it makes it sound like
I don't usually have great ideas.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.862
Oh, look at you.
You actually figured that out.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.864
-[chuckles] Damn right, I did.
-[chuckles]

03:19.449 --> 03:21.409
Wait. What?

03:21.492 --> 03:23.328
[theme song playing]

04:28.601 --> 04:31.729
Well, all in all
that wasn't our worst Easter.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.691
No cops, no deep-fried turkey fire.

04:34.774 --> 04:37.527
You and Colt didn't try
to juggle lawn darts.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.488
[chuckles] Come on!
That year was our best Easter.

04:40.571 --> 04:44.575
Got to ride around in an ambulance,
got this badass scar,

04:44.659 --> 04:45.827
first time I ever had Oxy.

04:47.161 --> 04:50.915
Sorry, first time
I was ever prescribed Oxy.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.585
That was Tylenol.
I took your Oxy.

04:56.587 --> 04:59.590
Anyway, you didn't say much
after your brother's big news.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.803
I mean, you know, Abby's awesome,

05:03.886 --> 05:05.430
but it's like,
it'd be nice to have a holiday

05:05.513 --> 05:06.973
where Colt doesn't get someone pregnant.

05:09.225 --> 05:10.935
Now we're supposed to what?
Just, like, let him off the hook?

05:11.019 --> 05:13.521
No, neither one of you are off the hook.

05:14.188 --> 05:17.317
Just Colt and Abby are pregnant
and we'll celebrate that.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.943
You're gonna be an uncle.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.654
Yeah, no, I know.
I'm gonna be good with the kid.

05:21.738 --> 05:26.159
You know, get him ice cream
and take him to the movies,

05:26.242 --> 05:28.494
get him some badass switchblades.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.331
It might be a girl.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.248
Oh, right.

05:33.249 --> 05:37.336
Well, in that case, no ice cream.
I don't want her to get fat, you know?

05:38.546 --> 05:41.799
Rooster, body image is a serious...
No, you know what?

05:41.883 --> 05:42.842
Oh!

05:43.885 --> 05:46.554
Oh, no, Maggie, he likes that.

05:46.637 --> 05:48.723
The only way to hurt him
is to make fun of his hair.

05:48.806 --> 05:50.266
[chuckles]

05:51.059 --> 05:52.185
Happy Easter, Mary.

05:52.268 --> 05:53.311
-'Sup?
-[Mary sighs]

05:53.394 --> 05:55.646
Happy Easter.
Darlene brought over her new boyfriend,

05:55.730 --> 05:57.148
who is under house arrest.

05:57.231 --> 06:00.193
His ankle bracelet beeped
the entire dinner.

06:00.276 --> 06:02.528
Can't believe that idiot doesn't know
you pry that shit off

06:02.612 --> 06:05.073
and you hang it on your dog's collar
before you leave the house.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.783
[chuckles softly]

06:06.866 --> 06:09.535
Yeah, well, ours sucked too.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.246
Abby told us that Colt knocked her up.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.123
Everyone was fighting,

06:14.207 --> 06:17.376
and in the commotion I thought my dip cup
was the gravy for the mashed potatoes.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.255
Holy shit. Colt knocked somebody up again?

06:21.339 --> 06:22.173
Yep.

06:22.256 --> 06:24.717
-Well, that boy is real good at one thing.
-[Rooster scoffs]

06:25.718 --> 06:28.805
-Well, welcome to being a grandma.
-[chuckles]

06:28.888 --> 06:32.100
[chuckles] Look at us,
we're a couple of GILFs.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.309
[chuckles]

06:33.392 --> 06:34.769
I'll buy you a shot?

06:34.852 --> 06:36.771
Yeah. Rooster, get the good stuff
from the back.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.397
What's the good stuff from the back?

06:38.481 --> 06:41.150
The Jack Daniels that
I haven't watered down yet.

06:44.153 --> 06:45.655
It's kind of weird seeing you
on this side of the bar.

06:46.447 --> 06:50.451
God, it must be nice to drink at work
without having to go out to your car.

06:51.869 --> 06:54.539
What is it with people in this town
drinking in their car?

06:55.915 --> 06:57.583
I'm not working.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.545
Rooster's just covering for me
'cause I'm helping out at the ranch.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.255
We're stretched a little thin.

07:03.172 --> 07:05.925
If you're looking for someone here,
I could really use the work.

07:06.008 --> 07:07.176
Cracker Barrel won't make me full-time

07:07.260 --> 07:09.053
'cause they don't wanna
give me health insurance.

07:09.137 --> 07:13.641
And 30% off a chicken-fried steak dinner
does not qualify as benefits.

07:15.393 --> 07:16.436
Disagree.

07:18.563 --> 07:22.108
Well, if I could afford to hire someone,
you think Rooster would be working here?

07:22.191 --> 07:24.694
Oh, no, no.
I'm fine just working for tips.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.196
Come on, it's a bar.
There's guys and alcohol.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.115
I got the girls.
I'll make plenty of money.

07:31.033 --> 07:32.368
Congratulations. You're hired.

07:33.661 --> 07:37.123
You know what? I'm gonna help Rooster
find the good stuff.

07:47.675 --> 07:48.509
Hello.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.304
Mr. Phillips. Mrs. Phillips.

07:51.387 --> 07:54.348
Oh, hi, Colt. Abby said
you might be stopping by.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.934
Hope it's not a big announcement,
'cause I'm all out of Xanax.

07:57.018 --> 07:57.852
Oh.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.357
Look, I know you guys
aren't my biggest fan.

08:04.609 --> 08:08.404
But I love your daughter
more than anything in the world.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.199
And I'm gonna be the best dad
any kid could ever ask for.

08:11.282 --> 08:12.617
We know.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.620
So, you're coming around on me?

08:15.703 --> 08:17.038
No.

08:19.123 --> 08:22.627
Right. Oh, well,
I hate to have to do this.

08:22.710 --> 08:26.047
Um, especially after the news
about Abby being pregnant.

08:27.256 --> 08:31.052
But, uh, it's, it's kind of why I'm here.
I need to ask a favor.

08:32.053 --> 08:35.890
I bought the Peterson Ranch
'cause it was a good investment.

08:35.973 --> 08:38.309
[stutters] And it still is,

08:38.392 --> 08:40.311
but I'm gonna need some help
if I'm gonna make it through.

08:40.394 --> 08:42.980
Well, if you're asking for money,
I'm gonna have to say no.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.191
No, no, no, no. It won't be a handout.

08:45.274 --> 08:48.778
I'll pay you back in full, with interest,
as soon as we get the cattle to market.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.488
[stutters] I mean,
this is a great opportunity,

08:50.571 --> 08:53.950
so I'll give you an hour to decide.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.201
[clears throat]

08:56.577 --> 09:01.207
Oh, on <i>Shark Tank,</i> Mr. Wonderful says
you gotta put a deadline on negotiations.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.876
You know what?
Take as much time as you need.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.838
We've been thinking
about your future, too.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.633
We want you to come here
and work at the dealership.

09:11.717 --> 09:12.552
Wait, what?

09:13.219 --> 09:14.929
This is a solid business.

09:15.012 --> 09:19.267
You'll have benefits and a stable salary
starting at 25K a year.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.518
And that's not it.

09:20.601 --> 09:23.479
You'd also have commission
and performance bonuses,

09:23.563 --> 09:27.066
plus full medical and dental.
And that's for your whole family.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.361
Wow, that... that's a hell of an offer.

09:30.444 --> 09:31.696
And...

09:32.321 --> 09:34.949
I don't remember the last time
I went to a dentist.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.660
And the hours are great, too.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.912
You could have breakfast
with Abby and the baby

09:39.996 --> 09:42.081
and then dinner with them at night.

09:42.164 --> 09:46.711
Or if you're Chuck, you could use
that family time to play golf.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.798
Janice, I bought you clubs.

09:52.508 --> 09:55.177
I've had a dead tooth for about two years.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.763
[stutters] That thing's like
a Copenhagen storage bin. [chuckles]

09:58.681 --> 09:59.515
Wow.

10:00.391 --> 10:01.892
Wow. Um...

10:03.352 --> 10:04.186
Um...

10:04.270 --> 10:06.355
[stutters] This isn't the way
I saw this going.

10:06.439 --> 10:10.276
I know, it's a lot to take in.
Talk with your family.

10:10.359 --> 10:15.281
But I gotta tell ya,
there is nothing I would like more

10:15.364 --> 10:19.493
than for someday, all of this,
to be yours and Abby's.

10:20.494 --> 10:22.747
Well, I... I really appreciate this.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.124
[stutters] I'll think about it. I will.
Uh, thank you.

10:25.750 --> 10:29.629
And who knows, maybe soon, Colt Bennett
will be our employee of the month.

10:29.712 --> 10:30.713
[chuckles]

10:30.796 --> 10:32.882
Yeah, maybe it'd be my picture
on the that wall, huh?

10:34.508 --> 10:36.177
That's an "In Memoriam."

10:38.262 --> 10:41.599
But that dead son of a bitch
could sell the shit out of a tractor.

10:47.438 --> 10:48.314
[Mary] Hey.

10:48.397 --> 10:49.690
Hey, Mary.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.861
I thought we agreed, uh,
no more booty calls.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.280
Oh, did we agree to that?

10:56.364 --> 10:57.323
Or did you just keep texting me

10:57.406 --> 10:58.991
in the middle of the night
until I blocked your number?

10:59.075 --> 11:00.409
[chuckles]

11:01.369 --> 11:02.411
[sighs] Well,

11:02.495 --> 11:04.121
-that's how the dance is done.
-[chuckles]

11:06.290 --> 11:07.792
Thanks.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.169
I, um, I just wanted
to make sure you're...

11:10.252 --> 11:12.296
You're cool with me
working at the bar, right?

11:12.380 --> 11:15.716
Oh, so if I say no, I'm not cool with it,
you're gonna quit?

11:15.800 --> 11:17.426
Fuck no.

11:18.677 --> 11:19.929
And the dance continues.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.059
[grunts] Anyway, good luck
concentrating at work

11:25.142 --> 11:28.145
when you see me
staring all night at you like this.

11:31.023 --> 11:31.857
[chuckles]

11:32.566 --> 11:34.860
It looks like you're trying
to read a word you don't know.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.320
[chuckles]

11:36.404 --> 11:38.197
You know what words I do know?

11:38.280 --> 11:39.865
Sex.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.117
Boobies.

11:41.992 --> 11:43.119
Don't you have a girlfriend?

11:43.744 --> 11:46.539
No, that's all done. I gotta be free.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.333
Like a bird in a Lynyrd Skynyrd song.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.751
Oh.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.378
Where was that bird
when you were over at my house

11:52.461 --> 11:53.796
begging me to get back together?

11:54.463 --> 11:55.881
Please. I was just trying
to get in your pants.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.927
That's my move.
Anyway, check this one out.

12:01.470 --> 12:02.471
[grunts]

12:04.306 --> 12:07.518
Mary. You're so great.

12:09.812 --> 12:10.980
I miss you so much.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.690
Mm.

12:12.773 --> 12:15.568
Oh, okay, so I'm supposed to be like,

12:15.651 --> 12:18.446
"Rooster, you're the man of my dreams.

12:19.155 --> 12:22.032
Take me. Take me now."

12:30.374 --> 12:34.670
[cell phone buzzing]

12:35.963 --> 12:38.549
-You gotta get that?
-No, it's just my boyfriend.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.303
-You got a boyfriend?
-Is that a problem?

12:42.386 --> 12:44.221
[clicks tongue]

12:44.305 --> 12:46.307
Well, I got two questions.

12:46.390 --> 12:47.766
How big is he?

12:48.726 --> 12:52.855
And is he a member of any group
that ends with the word "brotherhood"?

12:52.938 --> 12:55.191
[both chuckle]

12:58.861 --> 13:00.654
[motor puttering]

13:10.247 --> 13:11.582
We need to talk.

13:12.249 --> 13:15.252
Shit. Did you drink the Gatorade
out of my truck?

13:18.422 --> 13:19.757
People like you.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.554
Dad, it's me, Colt.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.808
People listen to you.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.937
I don't know why they do, but they do.

13:35.105 --> 13:36.857
You've always been a leader.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.736
Probably why you were a quarterback.

13:42.988 --> 13:43.864
Thank you.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.783
Certainly wasn't your arm.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.871
You throw like a girl.

13:53.415 --> 13:56.001
And we're back. [sighs]

13:57.753 --> 13:58.629
What's all this about?

14:00.089 --> 14:03.008
Ever since I heard that Abby was pregnant,

14:04.218 --> 14:06.887
I've been thinking about
what the future...

14:07.888 --> 14:09.682
looks like for the two of you.

14:11.433 --> 14:14.812
Actually, the three of you.
[chuckles softly]

14:16.272 --> 14:17.940
And there is no future here.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.485
This ranch is a sinking ship.

14:23.654 --> 14:27.575
But you have the potential
to do other things.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.745
Things beyond this place.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.258
You telling me to bail
'cause of the mess I got you in?

14:44.341 --> 14:46.427
No, this isn't your fault.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.181
And believe me,
I wish it was your fault. [chuckles]

14:52.850 --> 14:55.853
Whether we bought
the Peterson Ranch or not,

14:57.062 --> 14:59.982
the writing's on the wall
for people like us.

15:03.152 --> 15:06.405
You taught me hard work
can get you out of anything.

15:07.781 --> 15:08.657
You've always been right.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.994
Except for DUIs.

15:13.287 --> 15:17.416
Colt, I'm a rancher because
I never had any options, but you do.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.002
As a father...

15:21.462 --> 15:25.925
you want your kids
to have a better life than you had.

15:28.218 --> 15:30.471
That never happened around here.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.516
That's never going to happen around here.

15:37.144 --> 15:40.689
Don't do to your kid
what I did to you and Rooster.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.696
Abby's dad offered me a job.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.366
I heard. Take it.

15:51.158 --> 15:53.035
It's... I...

15:53.118 --> 15:55.162
I wouldn't feel right
leaving you and Rooster to--

15:55.245 --> 15:58.290
Did you listen to anything
I just said to you?

16:00.709 --> 16:05.255
Do you care about Abby
and this unborn child of yours?

16:05.923 --> 16:08.425
-Of course I do.
-Then take the job.

16:19.561 --> 16:23.899
[sighs] Will you stop your complaining?
You're the one who wanted to get tied up.

16:25.192 --> 16:28.028
Look, when I say I gotta pee, I gotta pee.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.741
Hey, you wanna hang out?

16:32.825 --> 16:36.495
I was gonna watch <i>Cops t</i>onight.
See if we know anybody.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.622
Oh! A few weeks ago,

16:38.706 --> 16:42.084
I saw my high school math teacher
get busted selling pot.

16:42.167 --> 16:45.129
So sad, kids today. Fucking narcs.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.338
[chuckles]

16:46.422 --> 16:49.091
Anyway, I can't. I promised my boyfriend
I'd meet him for dinner.

16:49.174 --> 16:52.344
[sighs] It's cool. No biggie.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.013
So, uh, what's up with this new guy?

16:55.097 --> 16:58.017
Um, well, when we have sex,
he doesn't say,

16:58.100 --> 17:00.936
"Can you smell what The Rock is cookin'?"

17:02.271 --> 17:04.023
Then we know that he's lame.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.107
[Mary chuckles]

17:05.190 --> 17:06.942
What's he do for a livin'?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.527
Well, you're not gonna like it.

17:09.236 --> 17:11.363
He's a badass ninja sex assassin.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.992
I don't recall seeing him
at any of the meetings.

17:15.075 --> 17:16.118
[chuckles]

17:17.578 --> 17:19.121
-[sighs]
-Are you jealous?

17:19.204 --> 17:21.790
[breathing heavily] You think the guy
who just had sex with you

17:21.874 --> 17:25.252
is jealous of the guy that's gotta
take you to dinner right now? Come on.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.337
We're going to Red Lobster.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.007
Shit. Cheddar biscuits.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.176
Guy's got game.

17:32.259 --> 17:33.385
[chuckles softly]

17:33.469 --> 17:36.180
[sighs] No, I was just trying to figure
out what we're doing.

17:36.263 --> 17:39.725
Is this gonna be an everyday thing again,
like drinking?

17:39.808 --> 17:40.726
Or...

17:41.477 --> 17:44.730
like a once in a while thing,
like brush your teeth?

17:47.399 --> 17:49.860
I don't know.
I mean, I just started dating him.

17:49.943 --> 17:51.612
You and I have talked about
my relationship with him

17:51.695 --> 17:52.988
more than he and I have.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.992
All right, no pressure.
Whatever makes you comfortable.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.537
How about this? When I feel like
hookin' up, I'll send you a sexy pic.

18:00.621 --> 18:03.207
And then you send me a picture back
of you brushing your teeth.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.050
Mr. and Mrs. Phillips.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.553
Oh, please, you're family.

18:16.637 --> 18:21.016
Call me Janice
and call Chuck "Mr. Phillips."

18:22.434 --> 18:26.021
Colt, you wouldn't believe
the day we had today.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.900
We sold a backhoe and
a 3 Series tractor to Neumann's Hill.

18:29.983 --> 18:32.945
And the guy who sold these,
by the way...

18:34.696 --> 18:35.781
that's his commission.

18:35.864 --> 18:37.449
Whoo! [chuckles]

18:37.533 --> 18:39.952
Forget that dead tooth.
I'm gonna have a gold tooth on that.

18:40.536 --> 18:41.578
Whoo!

18:41.662 --> 18:43.455
I got somethin' for ya.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.001
[chuckles]

18:49.044 --> 18:49.878
Thank you.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.467
All right, how do I look?

18:56.135 --> 18:58.262
Like a young, better-looking Chuck.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.684
You look like you belong.
You look like family.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.396
Oh! Well, we should celebrate.

19:07.479 --> 19:11.400
I'm gonna go get some Hostess CupCakes
out of the vending machine.

19:13.527 --> 19:14.862
What do you got here?

19:14.945 --> 19:17.489
Oh, we just got these in today.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.616
Kids wanna be like their daddies.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.494
And daddies hate to see their kids cry.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.663
Cha-ching. [chuckles]

19:28.167 --> 19:29.084
I can't take the job.

19:31.628 --> 19:32.462
What?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.719
I'm sorry, Mr. Phillips, I...

19:39.803 --> 19:41.054
I can't take the job.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.600
Okay, so they come two per pack.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.769
So I got four, so we have an extra.

19:47.853 --> 19:52.065
Oh, shoot, I should've gotten three.
And then we each could've had two.

19:53.942 --> 19:55.861
He doesn't want the job.

19:57.362 --> 19:58.780
What happened?

20:00.908 --> 20:04.870
I want my kids to have
the same experiences I had growing up.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.705
Throwing a football in the pasture,

20:08.248 --> 20:12.336
riding Kitty Cats in the winter,
swimming in that river.

20:13.003 --> 20:15.631
You realize you're not just making
a bad choice for you,

20:15.714 --> 20:18.759
you're making a bad choice
for my daughter and my grandchild.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.345
No.

20:22.596 --> 20:25.432
My family is not just Abby and that baby.

20:25.515 --> 20:28.310
It's my mom, my dad, my brother.

20:29.186 --> 20:32.940
Every Bennett who ever worked
their hands raw on that ranch.

20:33.857 --> 20:36.485
Except for me. I... I moisturize,
use a pumice stone.

20:39.154 --> 20:42.532
I appreciate the offer, I do. But...

20:44.159 --> 20:46.036
this wouldn't be the right thing.

20:46.119 --> 20:49.539
You wouldn't know the right thing
if it landed in your lap.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.592
You sure about this?

21:02.010 --> 21:02.928
Yeah.

21:12.312 --> 21:13.897
Good luck, Colt.

21:15.357 --> 21:16.525
Thank you, Janice.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.503
-Hey.
-[sighs]

21:44.094 --> 21:45.095
You want a drink?

21:47.222 --> 21:49.933
I stole a bottle of the good stuff
from Mom's bar.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.354
Yeah, sure.

21:57.065 --> 21:58.400
[clears throat]

22:03.780 --> 22:04.823
Well...

22:06.616 --> 22:08.577
at least you knocked up
the right girl this time.

22:10.662 --> 22:11.496
Yeah.

22:19.087 --> 22:22.215
You know we won't name this kid
Rooster, right?

22:23.633 --> 22:24.968
Really? That's weird.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.555
Generally, tradition to name the kid
after his father.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.477
Hopefully, you won't fuck this up
like everything else.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.355
Oh, who's that?

22:39.066 --> 22:41.777
Another hot chick
comin' for a little Rooster?

22:43.653 --> 22:44.738
Mrs. Phillips.

22:44.821 --> 22:45.864
Oh, nice.

22:46.823 --> 22:49.409
Guess I'm gonna end up being
your kid's step-grandfather.

22:53.747 --> 22:54.998
Colt. Rooster.

22:55.082 --> 22:57.501
Hey, Mrs. Phillips,
I was just talking about you.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.672
Hey, I just wanna say, uh,
congrats on the grandkid.

23:03.632 --> 23:07.469
I hope he has Abby's brains and looks.

23:07.552 --> 23:10.013
And Colt's, um...

23:11.306 --> 23:12.516
[clicks tongue]

23:13.100 --> 23:14.684
I don't know, sweet hat collection.

23:19.022 --> 23:22.317
Mrs. Phillips, how you doin'?

23:22.400 --> 23:25.195
I'm doing well, thanks. Can we talk?

23:25.278 --> 23:26.905
Yeah, sure. Have a seat. Oh.

23:26.988 --> 23:28.782
Wait, hold on.

23:30.659 --> 23:31.910
There you go.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.663
Can I get you something to drink?

23:35.497 --> 23:37.249
Well, maybe just a drop of whiskey.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.881
All right, say when.

23:52.055 --> 23:54.266
Okay, the glass said when, so...

23:57.477 --> 23:58.478
Look...

23:59.771 --> 24:03.150
if you came to talk about that job,
my mind's made up.

24:06.486 --> 24:07.362
What's this?

24:08.530 --> 24:12.075
It's a check. I'm investing in your ranch.

24:20.584 --> 24:21.418
Oh, my God.

24:22.043 --> 24:24.254
It won't solve all your problems, but...

24:24.337 --> 24:26.423
but it should help a little bit.
[clears throat]

24:33.638 --> 24:34.472
Thank you.

24:35.599 --> 24:37.434
This is, uh...

24:38.852 --> 24:40.312
This is amazing. Uh...

24:42.981 --> 24:45.150
What changed your mind?

24:47.611 --> 24:50.238
Chuck ever tell you
how he started his dealership?

24:51.907 --> 24:53.325
A couple of times.

24:54.242 --> 24:58.038
Said he, uh, used all his savings
and opened up that place

24:58.121 --> 25:00.874
across from the Caterpillar shop.

25:01.541 --> 25:04.544
Slashed his prices
until he ran them out of town.

25:04.628 --> 25:08.590
Usually ends with, "Then I'll run you
out of town too, Colt."

25:10.008 --> 25:12.427
Yeah, that's what happened
after he bought the place.

25:13.803 --> 25:16.640
But he wouldn't have been able to buy it
if he hadn't had any help.

25:16.723 --> 25:18.975
No bank would touch us.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.727
But he was so passionate about it

25:20.810 --> 25:22.979
that my uncle was convinced
to help him out.

25:24.147 --> 25:28.443
He had a little bit of money
'cause he never had any children.

25:28.526 --> 25:31.321
He was a confirmed bachelor.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.784
That's what we used to call gay men.

25:39.412 --> 25:40.956
We call 'em roommates now.

25:44.626 --> 25:45.585
You sure you wanna do this?

25:46.211 --> 25:47.837
We all need a little help, Colt.

25:56.137 --> 25:57.889
Thank you. And I will...

25:57.973 --> 26:00.308
First thing tomorrow,
I'll thank Mr. Phillips, too.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.811
Actually, he doesn't know I'm doing this.

26:04.938 --> 26:07.607
I was hoping we could just keep this
between the two of us.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.946
Yeah... I'm not sure--

26:13.029 --> 26:16.700
I love my daughter, Colt.
I would do anything for her.

26:19.577 --> 26:20.412
So would I.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.752
Thank you.

26:36.344 --> 26:37.846
Good Lord. [chuckles]

26:38.972 --> 26:41.016
Maybe we don't share that
with Chuck either.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.769
Yes, ma'am.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.897
Have a fun drive home.

26:55.989 --> 26:57.991
[fire crackling]

27:01.995 --> 27:04.873
[spraying]

27:07.334 --> 27:09.461
All right, get those Rain Birds all set.

27:09.544 --> 27:11.838
-I got some of your old artwork.
-Oh.

27:11.921 --> 27:14.090
Good. My dad's sentimental
about that stuff.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.676
-Oh, uh, I grabbed my Xbox.
-Good.

27:18.553 --> 27:21.222
-How much more is there?
-That's pretty much the last of it.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.432
We just gotta get the guns.

27:22.515 --> 27:26.269
You see that fire?
It is time to get the fuck out of here.

27:26.353 --> 27:29.230
[somber country song playing]
