WEBVTT

00:10.387 --> 00:11.715
Hey!

00:19.683 --> 00:21.458
Get away from my boat, thief !

00:26.816 --> 00:29.266
- You're not gonna do this.
- This is only the beginning.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.091
Alexx.

00:42.103 --> 00:45.086
Anterior shot to the head.
He was gone before he dropped.

00:45.312 --> 00:46.944
No mystery who the shooter was.

00:47.073 --> 00:48.920
He called it in. Jason Whitley.

00:49.100 --> 00:50.462
Rents a house here.

00:50.620 --> 00:53.454
He said that the victim
was trying to steal his yacht.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.390
Did Mr. Whitley mention this tool bag ?

00:56.525 --> 00:58.124
Yeah, victim had one.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.587
That's why he thought he was a pro.

00:59.587 --> 01:01.051
Why would a pro

01:01.119 --> 01:03.359
bring a padlock to a theft ?

01:03.804 --> 01:05.122
He's dead, isn't he ?

01:06.360 --> 01:08.398
I'm afraid so.
Mr. Whitley, have you

01:08.398 --> 01:10.323
had trouble making
your yacht payments ?

01:10.537 --> 01:11.821
What ?

01:11.887 --> 01:13.808
I-I don't see what that has to do with anything.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.299
Your intruder...

01:15.410 --> 01:16.739
is actually a repo man.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.340
And the repo agents
have to ID themselves.

01:19.593 --> 01:22.081
So you're saying that they didn't come to your house first ?

01:22.261 --> 01:24.119
Yeah, he came. Busted my window,

01:24.130 --> 01:25.391
broke in, took my keys.

01:25.391 --> 01:26.810
Why didn't you call the police ?

01:27.136 --> 01:28.578
He was stealing my yacht.

01:28.809 --> 01:30.453
When I told him to
get off, he shot at me.

01:30.486 --> 01:31.826
He had a gun ?

01:35.621 --> 01:36.938
I'm the victim here.

01:39.307 --> 01:40.523
Eric.

01:40.546 --> 01:42.569
Got something on the ignition key.

01:46.259 --> 01:48.050
It's definitely foreign.
I'll get it to Trace.

01:48.151 --> 01:49.998
Have we located the victim's firearm ?

01:50.347 --> 01:52.148
Oh, I don't know. I searched every inch of this puppy.

01:52.148 --> 01:53.499
Haven't found anything.

01:53.982 --> 01:55.288
Maybe it went in the water.

01:55.288 --> 01:56.661
You know what that means.

01:56.661 --> 01:58.012
I already called the Coast Guard
and told them

01:58.012 --> 01:59.600
to lock up this section of the canal...

01:59.949 --> 02:01.278
till I find it.

02:01.338 --> 02:02.588
Alexx.

02:02.599 --> 02:04.604
Does the repo man have an ID ?

02:04.716 --> 02:06.034
No.

02:06.214 --> 02:07.689
But take a look at this, Horatio.

02:13.871 --> 02:15.853
Wait a second.
This is a writ of entry.

02:16.461 --> 02:18.949
This man... is a revenue officer.

02:19.303 --> 02:20.553
You mean IRS ?

02:20.553 --> 02:22.636
So that makes this a seizure kit

02:23.007 --> 02:24.460
and Mr. Whitley

02:24.753 --> 02:26.149
a liar.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.126
Oh, man, this hurts.

03:26.953 --> 03:28.338
Never been shot before.

03:28.699 --> 03:30.714
Yeah, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

03:31.570 --> 03:33.428
Turns out that your repo man

03:34.216 --> 03:35.623
is actually an IRS agent.

03:37.624 --> 03:38.941
So?

03:40.754 --> 03:42.094
So...

03:42.195 --> 03:43.760
they're not allowed to carry guns.

03:46.051 --> 03:47.435
What are you trying to say?

03:47.739 --> 03:49.102
Maybe you shot yourself.

03:52.564 --> 03:53.780
Why don't you

03:53.780 --> 03:56.246
test my hands for powder, or whatever it is you do ?

03:56.246 --> 03:57.608
That washes off.

03:58.937 --> 04:00.400
Look, I got the proof right here.

04:01.565 --> 04:02.871
That...

04:03.063 --> 04:04.391
makes two of us.

04:13.330 --> 04:14.850
I heard you've got a bullet for me.

04:15.998 --> 04:17.349
Tax refund.

04:20.957 --> 04:22.668
Hey, Alexx, may I see your magnifier ?

04:23.411 --> 04:24.695
Sure.

04:28.483 --> 04:30.318
There's a pattern imbedded in the lead.

04:30.712 --> 04:31.973
From what ?

04:31.973 --> 04:34.473
Velocity of the bullet makes the lead malleable.

04:35.359 --> 04:36.800
This bullet went through clothing.

04:36.969 --> 04:38.286
I'll do some more digging.

04:39.649 --> 04:40.977
Are those our vic's clothes ?

04:41.031 --> 04:42.137
Yeah.

04:45.103 --> 04:46.947
There's something in the wound track.

04:51.910 --> 04:53.430
Some kind of fabric.

05:01.831 --> 05:03.464
Found a bullet hole in the sleeve.

05:04.263 --> 05:06.178
Our vic's hands were in front of his face.

05:13.348 --> 05:14.891
Well, that puts our victim in a

05:14.902 --> 05:16.208
defensive position.

05:17.176 --> 05:19.282
Unless he was reaching for his gun.

05:21.888 --> 05:23.228
Like the suspect said.

05:24.984 --> 05:26.414
Got ourselves a mystery.

05:34.542 --> 05:35.848
Lieutenant Caine.

05:35.409 --> 05:36.737
Yes.

05:36.197 --> 05:37.672
Melissa Boone, IRS.

05:37.869 --> 05:39.231
You called about Kevin Renfro ?

05:39.265 --> 05:41.483
Yes, I did. I understand
that he worked for you.

05:43.138 --> 05:44.512
Brought his client list.

05:44.546 --> 05:46.133
Your suspect, Jason Whitley, is in it.

05:46.319 --> 05:48.210
He owes $60,000 in back taxes.

05:48.278 --> 05:50.372
$60,000? That's quiet
a big number, isn't it ?

05:50.485 --> 05:52.455
Yeah. He's also a PDT.

05:55.096 --> 05:56.886
A potentially dangerous taxpayer ?

05:58.935 --> 06:00.748
He threatened to kill
Officer Renfro last month

06:00.771 --> 06:02.088
in Saint Augustine.

06:03.590 --> 06:05.155
Hmm, that qualifies, doesn't it ?

06:05.617 --> 06:06.868
Thank you.

06:06.899 --> 06:08.116
Any time.

06:10.582 --> 06:12.418
It's a figure of speech.

06:12.488 --> 06:14.076
But you did shoot and kill him.

06:14.414 --> 06:17.192
Look, he tried to take
my boat down in Augustine.

06:17.262 --> 06:18.602
All right ? I told him

06:18.602 --> 06:20.809
I'd try work out a payment plan until he had a writ.

06:21.242 --> 06:22.773
Until then, "Go to hell."

06:23.043 --> 06:24.743
Then you brought your boat to Miami ?

06:24.957 --> 06:27.052
- Is that it ?
- And you laid in wait.

06:28.099 --> 06:29.416
I didn't recognize him,

06:29.961 --> 06:31.256
all right ?
He looked like a thug.

06:31.256 --> 06:32.596
He was an unarmed man.

06:33.441 --> 06:34.758
God as my witness,

06:34.949 --> 06:36.571
that man tried to kill me.

06:36.942 --> 06:38.237
He had a gun.

06:38.445 --> 06:40.224
I'm telling you, he shot me.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.796
- Found a gun.
- What caliber ?

07:04.201 --> 07:05.507
You tell me.

07:07.363 --> 07:09.671
- What kind of gun is this ?
- It's a key gun.

07:09.918 --> 07:11.727
It's used to make keys on the fly.

07:12.283 --> 07:13.904
Get away from my boat, thief !

07:21.703 --> 07:23.043
Explains the shavings I found.

07:23.116 --> 07:24.222
Later.

07:24.253 --> 07:25.470
Where you going ?

07:25.535 --> 07:26.753
Find Horatio.

07:27.034 --> 07:30.249
- You're not going to wait for me ?
- Well, he wanted our findings ASAP.

07:32.022 --> 07:34.018
Hey, I found those findings.

07:38.261 --> 07:40.406
Nice work, Mr. Wolfe.

07:41.191 --> 07:43.174
I'd like to see
your injury again, please ?

07:51.589 --> 07:54.689
That, Mr. Whitley,
is a close-proximity burn.

07:55.668 --> 07:56.399
What ?

07:56.414 --> 07:58.712
What that means is the weapon
was held against your leg

07:58.712 --> 08:01.486
when it was discharged.
It also means that you did

08:01.586 --> 08:03.004
shoot yourself.

08:07.843 --> 08:09.750
You tried to frame a man
for doing his job.

08:10.554 --> 08:11.884
This is only the beginning.

08:11.909 --> 08:13.278
I've got this key gun,

08:13.667 --> 08:15.550
and I can make a key
to everything you own

08:15.901 --> 08:17.232
and seize it.

08:23.773 --> 08:25.141
He was taking my life,

08:26.966 --> 08:28.297
piece

08:28.297 --> 08:29.615
by piece.

08:32.979 --> 08:34.297
Jason...

08:34.666 --> 08:36.648
you should have just
paid your taxes.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.030
Yes, Frank.

08:39.047 --> 08:40.365
Take him in.

08:44.662 --> 08:46.068
Two bullets to the chest.

08:48.579 --> 08:50.876
Our victim is Revenue Officer Simon Bremmer.

08:51.647 --> 08:53.140
That's two in one day, Frank.

08:54.068 --> 08:55.373
IRS agent.

08:56.792 --> 08:58.110
That's correct.

08:58.660 --> 09:00.003
Think there's any connection ?

09:01.271 --> 09:02.589
It's tax season.

09:20.126 --> 09:21.304
There's a lot of blood.

09:21.306 --> 09:23.326
Two holes in the
chest'll do that to you.

09:23.591 --> 09:25.548
ME said one of 'em was a through-and-through.

09:28.737 --> 09:30.043
Come here and look at this.

09:35.921 --> 09:37.264
That's half a blood drop.

09:37.264 --> 09:39.397
He can't physically have half a blood drop.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.821
- Defies the laws of gravity.
- Something was taken from here.

09:48.971 --> 09:50.302
Whatever it is...

09:51.411 --> 09:52.767
might be a motive.

09:52.980 --> 09:55.351
Could be incidental.
Crime isn't always predictable.

09:57.876 --> 09:59.219
Good thing blood is.

10:00.204 --> 10:01.560
Did you find a blood trail ?

10:04.744 --> 10:06.853
Directionality indicates that the victim

10:08.497 --> 10:09.878
was moving toward the car.

10:16.697 --> 10:18.429
So he was shot away from the car.

10:21.266 --> 10:22.872
Someone pulled off the road.

10:27.777 --> 10:29.258
I've got some casings.

10:34.241 --> 10:35.572
What caliber?

10:38.414 --> 10:39.719
Nine-mil.

10:41.627 --> 10:43.736
What about the tire tracks? Do you think we're going to be able to ID 'em ?

10:44.037 --> 10:46.033
Well, talk to Delko.
He's the tire expert.

10:48.323 --> 10:49.603
Delko.

10:50.783 --> 10:52.528
Right. Sure.
I'll do that. Thanks.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.786
Tire treads from the
second IRS shooting?

11:18.545 --> 11:19.553
Yup.

11:21.284 --> 11:22.950
You know that's my
specialty, right?

11:23.760 --> 11:25.347
Well, I figured you were busy.

11:25.915 --> 11:28.129
Oh, I've got plenty of
time on my hands, Wolfe,

11:28.164 --> 11:31.207
especially since you closed
the last case without me.

11:40.712 --> 11:41.969
What's the wheelbase?

11:47.923 --> 11:49.413
140 inches.

11:49.448 --> 11:51.015
Wow, that's pretty wide.

11:52.041 --> 11:54.623
Not that many cars
wear 21-inch tires.

11:56.922 --> 12:00.156
With that tread, I'd be looking
for a Rolls-Royce Phantom,

12:00.191 --> 12:03.233
but, uh... that's just me.

12:10.725 --> 12:13.165
IRS vic number two.

12:13.930 --> 12:15.196
Bullets: fragmented.

12:15.231 --> 12:16.827
They pinged around in there.

12:16.862 --> 12:18.970
Hit a rib, the clavicle...

12:25.813 --> 12:28.598
Well, that makes things kind
of difficult, to say the least.

12:28.833 --> 12:30.684
Not with this.

12:34.049 --> 12:35.322
Mees' lines?

12:35.357 --> 12:37.406
Simon says he was
being poisoned.

12:37.441 --> 12:38.839
A heavy metal.

12:43.645 --> 12:46.825
Maybe whoever was poisoning
got impatient and shot him?

12:46.860 --> 12:48.921
Well, now, honey,
you're the investigator.

12:50.328 --> 12:51.996
I'll start at his office.

12:52.031 --> 12:53.508
Thanks, Alexx.

13:02.185 --> 13:04.132
Internal Revenue Service.
Please hold.

13:04.167 --> 13:06.136
This is Simon's office.

13:06.571 --> 13:07.887
Thank you.

13:07.922 --> 13:11.535
Can you think of anyone who
might've especially hated Simon?

13:11.770 --> 13:13.980
We're tax collectors.
Everyone hates us.

13:16.115 --> 13:18.648
Extension 32, if you
guys need anything.

13:20.401 --> 13:22.378
This guy was being poisoned.

13:22.413 --> 13:24.480
I'm not putting my mouth
anywhere near that phone.

13:24.515 --> 13:26.724
All right, I'll bag, you tag.

13:26.759 --> 13:29.371
Anything that Simon's lips
or hands might've touched.

13:39.269 --> 13:40.614
Calleigh, come here
and look at this.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.864
Simon's got a wall of fame.

13:45.317 --> 13:46.935
He was proud of his hate mail.

13:49.033 --> 13:51.059
Tax collectors
are the barnacles

13:51.094 --> 13:52.584
under the parasites

13:52.619 --> 13:53.865
under the snake.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.124
May you live on the street,

13:55.159 --> 13:56.333
no shoes for your feet.

13:56.368 --> 13:57.453
That's poetic.

13:57.488 --> 14:00.131
Ouch. Take a look at this one.

14:00.552 --> 14:02.376
"There should be a
medal for killing you."

14:03.580 --> 14:06.357
"Sincerely, Russell Edge."

14:07.165 --> 14:08.932
Let's see his list of PDTs.

14:14.704 --> 14:17.177
Simon confiscated two
houses from this guy.

14:18.065 --> 14:20.489
He was hunting for
Mr. Edge's Rolls-Royce.

14:20.724 --> 14:22.689
That's the same car
as the crime scene.

14:24.063 --> 14:26.309
I'm going to call Tripp and
see if Russell owns a nine-mil.

14:35.318 --> 14:36.582
Why do you want my gun?

14:36.917 --> 14:39.566
The IRS agent in charge of
your case was shot this morning,

14:39.601 --> 14:41.485
Mr. Edge, with a nine-mil.

14:43.052 --> 14:44.885
Well, I don't
know where it is.

14:45.220 --> 14:47.044
Probably disappeared
with your Rolls-Royce,

14:47.079 --> 14:48.678
along with the
rest of your stuff.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.532
Three 50-inch
flat-screens,

14:50.567 --> 14:51.355
a Schnabel,

14:51.390 --> 14:53.313
a purebred Arabian
racehorse...

14:53.348 --> 14:55.828
My ex-wife is a little
bloodthirsty, so I...

14:56.621 --> 14:58.164
I pared down
before the divorce.

15:00.459 --> 15:01.531
"Pared down"?

15:03.454 --> 15:05.584
Says here no record
of items sold.

15:05.619 --> 15:07.742
I'm not much for
keeping receipts.

15:07.777 --> 15:10.502
The IRS can't seize
assets they can't find.

15:10.537 --> 15:11.630
Is that it, Mr. Edge?

15:11.665 --> 15:13.424
I'm sorry. I'm afraid
I can't help you.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.088
We find out you killed
a federal officer,

15:16.123 --> 15:17.531
you won't be able
to hide from us.

15:17.566 --> 15:20.156
Again... I'm
sorry I can't help.

15:21.563 --> 15:23.370
I'll bet your ex-wife will.

15:25.074 --> 15:26.226
Been there, done that.

15:26.261 --> 15:28.144
"Hell hath no
fury," huh, Russell?

15:28.179 --> 15:29.064
She's a liar.

15:29.099 --> 15:31.324
Yeah, well, they all
are after we divorce 'em.

15:43.836 --> 15:45.276
Thanks for coming, Mrs. Edge.

15:45.311 --> 15:46.821
Um, Molly.

15:46.856 --> 15:48.195
So, what did Russell do now?

15:48.568 --> 15:50.368
Well, your ex-husband
owns a nine-millimeter gun

15:50.403 --> 15:51.888
that we can't seem to locate.

15:51.923 --> 15:54.023
You haven't seen it by
any chance, have you?

15:54.058 --> 15:55.699
No.

15:55.734 --> 15:57.755
This isn't about
taxes, isn't it?

15:57.790 --> 16:00.309
No. His case officer was
shot and killed this morning.

16:01.945 --> 16:05.546
Any, uh... any thoughts on his missing
assets would be a big help to us.

16:05.581 --> 16:07.615
I went to pick up my stuff

16:07.650 --> 16:09.487
after the divorce was final,

16:09.522 --> 16:10.855
but the place was empty.

16:10.890 --> 16:12.283
Yeah, he pared
down, didn't he?

16:14.751 --> 16:16.230
Detective...

16:16.265 --> 16:18.444
Russell is not a nice man...

16:19.413 --> 16:20.723
but he's smart.

16:22.076 --> 16:25.085
And if he knew that I had copies
of his old business files...

16:25.120 --> 16:26.851
We've got forensic
accountants here.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.178
Why don't you bring
those files in?

16:28.213 --> 16:29.713
Maybe we'll both
benefit from them.

16:30.601 --> 16:32.257
Okay.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.761
Thank you, Mrs. Edge.

16:37.179 --> 16:38.643
Simon's tox report came back.

16:38.678 --> 16:39.978
Our heavy metal's thallium.

16:40.013 --> 16:41.850
I know. Alexx told me.

16:44.191 --> 16:45.559
You were going
to call me, right?

16:45.594 --> 16:47.014
About the tox report?

16:47.049 --> 16:48.191
Of course.

16:48.226 --> 16:49.622
We always include each other.

16:53.196 --> 16:54.700
Delko told you.

16:55.788 --> 16:58.453
Yes. The lab is
like high school.

16:58.488 --> 16:59.883
Word spreads fast.

17:02.881 --> 17:05.401
So, this is everything we
collected from Simon's office?

17:06.392 --> 17:08.855
Yeah, I got some
gold metallo-cryptand,

17:08.890 --> 17:11.186
and it should bind with
thallium and glow under UV light.

17:11.222 --> 17:12.107
You want to spray?

17:13.210 --> 17:14.704
Should I apologize?

17:14.740 --> 17:17.767
Only if you think you have
something to apologize for.

17:23.746 --> 17:24.997
His stapler...

17:25.906 --> 17:27.505
his shredder...

17:28.263 --> 17:29.653
his coffee cup.

17:31.422 --> 17:34.039
His entire cubicle was poisoned.

17:38.717 --> 17:40.886
They didn't dose one thing.
They dosed everything.

17:48.439 --> 17:50.447
They'd have to count on
hand-to-mouth contact.

17:50.482 --> 17:52.476
That's not the most efficient
way to poison somebody.

17:52.511 --> 17:53.980
But it would prolong the agony.

18:07.473 --> 18:09.658
Poison gets in, binds
with proteins in the blood

18:09.693 --> 18:13.281
and deposits itself in
the organs, hair, nails.

18:17.272 --> 18:18.786
We got one determined killer.

18:19.319 --> 18:21.873
Who had a lot of access
to Simon's office.

18:26.536 --> 18:27.836
Is this garbage duty?

18:29.952 --> 18:31.386
IRS guys write
everything down.

18:31.421 --> 18:33.103
I figured you could go
through Simon's shredder.

18:33.138 --> 18:34.775
You could, uh, find
a lead in there.

18:38.727 --> 18:40.041
'Cause you said you had time.

18:42.997 --> 18:44.191
So, you include me now?

18:46.312 --> 18:47.094
You know what, Delko?

18:47.129 --> 18:48.240
You were still in the water.

18:48.275 --> 18:49.837
Should've given me a hand.

18:50.210 --> 18:52.044
Horatio needed what
we had right away.

18:54.947 --> 18:56.153
Look, do you want in or not?

18:59.521 --> 19:00.474
Beat it.

19:00.509 --> 19:01.753
I got work to do.

20:18.082 --> 20:20.412
Somebody shredded a
check for five grand

20:20.447 --> 20:22.234
dated two days ago.

20:22.269 --> 20:23.682
Not even endorsed yet.

20:23.717 --> 20:25.245
It's definitely
not our IRS guy.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.630
Collecting money's
the whole point.

20:27.998 --> 20:29.144
Well, I got a print
from the check.

20:29.179 --> 20:30.176
I'm running it now.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.211
Here we go.

20:35.246 --> 20:36.387
Take a look at our suspect.

20:36.422 --> 20:37.900
It's gender-consistent.

20:37.935 --> 20:39.748
Poisonings usually
are done by women.

20:45.114 --> 20:49.217
You destroyed a check Simon
collected from another taxpayer.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.745
I'm competitive.

21:11.780 --> 21:12.809
I admit it.

21:14.456 --> 21:16.616
I don't know the ins
and outs of the IRS,

21:16.651 --> 21:20.456
but I would imagine that it's against
some federal regulation to, uh,

21:21.228 --> 21:23.356
shred another
agent's collection.

21:25.795 --> 21:27.473
I trained Simon,

21:28.110 --> 21:30.416
and he was already
outpacing me on 53s.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.010
That's cases closed.

21:34.045 --> 21:35.400
Yeah.

21:36.859 --> 21:37.861
So, you poisoned him,

21:39.127 --> 21:40.986
and figured he'd be
out a few sick days,

21:41.021 --> 21:42.723
and you'd catch
up on collection?

21:42.758 --> 21:44.367
I didn't poison him.

21:45.034 --> 21:46.958
I snooped his office,
tore up a few checks.

21:46.993 --> 21:49.083
He'd get them
reissued, no big deal.

21:54.037 --> 21:55.360
Let me see your hands.

22:06.579 --> 22:07.975
What are those lines ?

22:08.919 --> 22:10.660
Exposure to thallium.

22:12.288 --> 22:13.591
Oh, my God.

22:14.901 --> 22:18.131
You spent a lot of time snooping
around Simon's office.

22:19.952 --> 22:21.267
Am I going to die ?

22:22.165 --> 22:24.431
No. The damage is reversible.

22:25.724 --> 22:29.384
But I'd think twice the next time you
want to camp out in someone's office.

22:31.114 --> 22:32.432
Have you got anything ?

22:34.032 --> 22:36.047
IRS lady's not our black widow.

22:36.769 --> 22:38.354
Well, I might have something.

22:38.675 --> 22:42.073
I looked closer at the poison.
It's thallium phosphate.

22:43.418 --> 22:44.736
An insecticide ?

22:45.033 --> 22:46.188
Nasty stuff.

22:46.262 --> 22:47.625
Only the pros use it.

22:48.292 --> 22:50.484
I'd bet one of Simon's PDTs owns

22:50.539 --> 22:51.816
a pest control company.

22:51.877 --> 22:53.262
Actually, a nursery.

22:53.308 --> 22:57.647
Carl Dawson. It's on Windmere Avenue and
he's into the IRS for almost a million dollars.

22:57.761 --> 22:59.268
Murder's one way to get out of paying.

22:59.314 --> 23:01.453
I'll find Horatio, make a surprise visit.

23:14.426 --> 23:16.026
Nobody answered when I phoned.

23:16.293 --> 23:18.816
IRS may have been responsible for that.

23:19.331 --> 23:20.870
This place was seized yesterday.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.516
"Contents will be sold at..."

23:23.421 --> 23:24.683
You hear that ?

23:24.991 --> 23:26.991
I did hear that. Officer, please...

23:27.145 --> 23:28.452
the bolt cutters.

23:37.539 --> 23:38.524
Sir ?

23:38.770 --> 23:40.077
Sir, hold it right there.

23:40.462 --> 23:42.385
- It's okay. It's my place.
- Not anymore.

23:42.416 --> 23:43.877
It's the property of the IRS.

23:43.938 --> 23:47.861
Step forward, sir, please. And you, son,
come here. Son, you, come here, right here.

23:48.046 --> 23:49.815
Right over here, right next to me.

23:54.367 --> 23:56.444
Sir, put that down, please.

24:00.396 --> 24:01.688
Okay, Frank.

24:04.331 --> 24:05.685
Hey. Hey, let him go.

24:05.716 --> 24:07.361
- Son...
- Seth, stay back.

24:07.362 --> 24:10.116
- Dad, this is our place.
- Listen to me : stay back.

24:17.129 --> 24:18.744
Please, not in front of my sons.

24:25.929 --> 24:26.854
Frank...

24:28.110 --> 24:29.338
no bracelets.

24:34.864 --> 24:36.037
Dad, what's going on ?

24:44.047 --> 24:45.137
Ready, gentlemen ?

24:47.014 --> 24:48.450
Let's go. Come on.

25:00.250 --> 25:03.453
If you're expecting to see remorse over
Simon Bremmer, you got the wrong guy.

25:03.508 --> 25:06.324
In my opinion, Mr. Dawson,
that makes you...

25:06.448 --> 25:07.690
the right guy.

25:07.803 --> 25:09.003
And so

25:09.045 --> 25:10.618
does this insecticide.

25:11.308 --> 25:13.503
It was found all over Mr. Bremmer's office.

25:13.919 --> 25:15.658
Any commercial user can get a hold of that.

25:15.714 --> 25:18.709
But not "anyone" can be on his PDT list, though,

25:18.764 --> 25:19.923
can they ?

25:20.823 --> 25:22.106
This whole thing is a mistake.

25:22.162 --> 25:25.681
You mean killing Mr. Bremmer,
or not paying taxes on $3 million ?

25:25.723 --> 25:27.048
Try $30,000.

25:27.188 --> 25:28.720
A two-decimal-point error.

25:28.927 --> 25:31.439
The IRS listed my wife's life insurance wrong.

25:31.798 --> 25:33.192
Did you show him your policy ?

25:33.302 --> 25:35.028
"The IRS doesn't make mistakes."

25:35.168 --> 25:36.424
I threw him out of my house.

25:36.507 --> 25:37.846
Tax court would've been easier.

25:37.956 --> 25:39.115
Yeah, I tried that,

25:39.184 --> 25:42.036
but every day I waited meant
more interest. I finally gave up.

25:42.284 --> 25:43.651
They took my house away.

25:44.053 --> 25:47.117
As long as I delivered my payments
on time, I could keep the business.

25:47.269 --> 25:48.635
Obviously, you didn't pay up.

25:48.721 --> 25:50.121
No, see, that's just the thing.

25:50.214 --> 25:53.721
I was never late. I just delivered a payment. He took my business anyway.

25:53.906 --> 25:55.383
Now, that sounds like motive.

25:55.935 --> 25:58.089
Look, you just said
I was on the PDT list.

25:58.273 --> 26:00.412
I wasn't allowed to go
anywhere near Simon's office.

26:00.502 --> 26:02.763
Mr. Dawson, is that your payment ?

26:04.810 --> 26:06.671
Yeah, looks like it.
What happened to it ?

26:07.210 --> 26:09.010
How did you send the checks ?

26:09.608 --> 26:10.992
Checks went by mail.

26:15.273 --> 26:16.865
See, here's the problem.

26:18.144 --> 26:21.436
I don't see a postmark or
a stamp on there, Mr. Dawson.

26:31.592 --> 26:33.454
Excuse me. Frank.

26:40.339 --> 26:41.585
You guys all right ?

26:47.001 --> 26:50.185
Okay, gentlemen, I'm going to ask
you a question, and I want the truth.

26:50.219 --> 26:53.163
Did your dad send you
to Simon's with the poison ?

26:55.838 --> 26:56.647
No.

26:59.254 --> 27:02.377
Seth, I cannot help you
if you won't let me.

27:05.221 --> 27:07.005
Yeah, that's what the IRS guy said.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.375
We ended up living in a car.

27:16.026 --> 27:17.303
Don't tell him.

27:18.069 --> 27:19.300
He doesn't know.

27:25.414 --> 27:28.814
Seth, he's figured it out,
and he's trying to protect you.

27:32.003 --> 27:33.357
I was just trying to help,

27:33.511 --> 27:34.619
you know ?

27:35.049 --> 27:36.326
Fix things.

27:40.355 --> 27:42.616
My dad, he's not doing too good.

27:42.878 --> 27:44.247
Not since my mom died.

27:44.430 --> 27:48.707
Okay, and you believed that his problem
would go away if the IRS agent did, right ?

27:56.711 --> 27:58.372
I knew the bug juice was harsh.

28:02.433 --> 28:05.149
And when we went to deliver
the checks, Simon made it so easy.

28:05.424 --> 28:06.962
Get you a soda, something to eat ?

28:07.008 --> 28:08.008
Sure.

28:08.147 --> 28:09.808
I guess he felt sorry for me.

28:10.562 --> 28:11.808
So, I let him.

28:29.014 --> 28:30.891
So, it wasn't going fast enough.

28:31.845 --> 28:32.707
What ?

28:32.799 --> 28:34.306
- What do you mean ?
- You shot him,

28:34.352 --> 28:35.291
didn't you ?

28:36.799 --> 28:37.568
No.

28:38.314 --> 28:40.268
But you know where
your dad keeps his gun,

28:41.852 --> 28:42.744
don't you ?

28:53.746 --> 28:56.177
Hey, Ian, are you the accountant
on the IRS shooting ?

28:56.223 --> 28:57.300
Uh, yeah.

28:57.415 --> 29:01.459
I went through Russell Edge's business records the ex-wife handed over.

29:01.582 --> 29:04.352
I was, uh, just going to burn you a disc.

29:06.358 --> 29:08.404
I tracked down all his real estate.

29:08.727 --> 29:11.727
Oh, good. So, you found out
where he's hidden all his assets.

29:12.103 --> 29:13.503
I thought so.

29:13.642 --> 29:17.549
He, uh, bought a slew of
warehouses in Overtown, but

29:17.640 --> 29:20.255
they were already seized by the IRS.

29:21.778 --> 29:24.569
- What about that one ?
- Oh, that doesn't belong to Russell.

29:24.668 --> 29:28.161
- Are you sure ?
- It's owned by a "Goldie Chariot."

29:28.238 --> 29:30.207
Only a PO box listed.

29:30.266 --> 29:32.036
I don't think that sounds like a real name.

29:32.082 --> 29:33.574
That's what I thought. So,

29:33.636 --> 29:37.749
I checked out all of Russell's relatives,
known associates. Nothing.

29:37.811 --> 29:41.226
What about pets ? You know how sneaky people are when they're hiding from the IRS.

29:41.295 --> 29:43.726
Yeah, but I don't have a list.

29:45.615 --> 29:47.323
He did own

29:47.646 --> 29:49.277
a racehorse.

29:52.874 --> 29:54.167
"Golden Chariot."

29:56.457 --> 29:58.242
Looks like Goldie is dead.

29:58.288 --> 30:00.195
He's got it listed as a loss.

30:00.349 --> 30:01.965
His loss is our gain.

30:02.534 --> 30:03.765
Thanks, Ian.

30:04.264 --> 30:05.480
Thank you.

30:15.850 --> 30:17.634
Think the IRS gives finder fees ?

30:18.004 --> 30:19.280
You wish.

30:24.176 --> 30:25.360
There's no Rolls,

30:25.376 --> 30:28.756
but it sure looks like there was
one parked here. Tire treads.

30:28.842 --> 30:31.091
Probably got rid of it.
Could be covered in blood.

30:34.201 --> 30:35.786
All we need is the gun.

30:48.999 --> 30:50.199
Got it.

30:53.133 --> 30:54.349
Nine-mil.

30:56.395 --> 31:00.718
I won't be able to tell if it's been fired
until I get back to the lab, but it's...

31:00.841 --> 31:02.472
two shy in the magazine.

31:03.713 --> 31:04.529
So ?

31:04.821 --> 31:07.898
It's my nine-mil. It's been locked
in that warehouse for months.

31:08.590 --> 31:10.113
It was cleaned recently.

31:10.190 --> 31:12.005
I took it out for target practice.

31:12.434 --> 31:13.680
I'm hygienic.

31:13.850 --> 31:14.680
So what ?

31:14.742 --> 31:18.096
All we have to do is match it to the
bullet we found in the victim's body.

31:20.977 --> 31:23.253
- Why don't you make it easier
on yourself ? Tell the truth.

31:23.327 --> 31:24.523
I am.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.154
I didn't kill that IRS guy.

31:26.621 --> 31:28.113
I hope you have a good lawyer.

31:28.990 --> 31:30.205
Hey, Ryan ?

31:31.282 --> 31:33.436
Who you think a jury's
going to side with, hmm ?

31:33.744 --> 31:34.748
Me...

31:34.809 --> 31:36.150
or some tax guy ?

31:36.341 --> 31:37.510
We'll see !

31:38.740 --> 31:40.755
Ryan, why don't we talk
outside for a second ?

31:49.767 --> 31:51.705
- We can't do a bullet comparison.
- We can't ?

31:51.736 --> 31:54.290
No. The bullet in Simon
fragmented on impact.

31:54.521 --> 31:58.521
Great. So, I was just threatening
him with nonexistent evidence.

31:59.834 --> 32:00.896
Hi, guys.

32:00.911 --> 32:02.388
Not now, okay ?

32:02.696 --> 32:05.788
You aware Al Capone was
brought down by an accountant ?

32:06.217 --> 32:08.001
Are you bragging,
or do you have something ?

32:08.140 --> 32:10.032
I might have found that Rolls-Royce.

32:11.085 --> 32:13.731
A rented parking space.
How did we miss that ?

32:13.861 --> 32:17.245
It was listed as feed storage.
Still looking for the rental contract.

32:17.828 --> 32:19.766
This gave us a nice start. Thank you.

32:20.028 --> 32:21.028
Sure.

32:25.724 --> 32:27.816
I spoke to Security.
It should be open.

32:28.678 --> 32:30.509
I'll look for high-velocity spatter.

32:38.175 --> 32:39.190
Any blood ?

32:39.221 --> 32:41.536
Not yet. Doesn't always
end up where you think.

32:44.419 --> 32:46.066
Exactly. Look at that.

32:50.287 --> 32:51.656
Are those heel marks ?

32:52.026 --> 32:53.703
From a woman's shoe.

32:54.347 --> 32:56.300
Too bad we don't have a heel database.

32:56.839 --> 33:00.254
I don't think we're going to need one.
We're looking for the wrong biological.

33:14.423 --> 33:16.466
Okay, I got semen in the backseat.

33:16.473 --> 33:19.885
Well, with the heel tread on
the ceiling, it stands to reason.

33:28.759 --> 33:30.271
Russell probably got lucky

33:30.275 --> 33:32.040
a million times in the
back of this thing.

33:32.040 --> 33:33.806
This car was at the crime scene.

33:33.814 --> 33:35.437
I'll take those odds.

33:47.843 --> 33:49.926
Biologicals from the backseat.

33:53.369 --> 33:55.842
Simon Bremmer, the IRS guy ?

33:56.902 --> 33:58.595
Russell was with Simon ?

34:01.054 --> 34:03.247
No, his ex-wife was.

34:10.583 --> 34:11.440
How'd you know that ?

34:11.489 --> 34:13.455
Our accountant found
the parking space agent.

34:13.455 --> 34:15.583
Russell didn't rent the space; she did.

34:16.087 --> 34:18.590
- I'm not admitting to anything.
- You don't have to.

34:18.596 --> 34:20.324
We already know what happened.

34:20.395 --> 34:23.112
You found your ex's hiding place,
and you stole the Rolls-Royce.

34:23.822 --> 34:25.878
Okay, look, the divorce
settlement was unfair.

34:26.049 --> 34:27.565
I mean, what was I
supposed to live on ?

34:28.522 --> 34:31.331
So you rented your own space
and hid the Rolls in there.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.516
Yeah, two can play the game.

34:34.141 --> 34:36.520
But Simon Bremmer was
better than both of you.

34:36.525 --> 34:38.556
He caught you with
the Rolls-Royce, didn't he?

34:39.701 --> 34:42.440
Yeah. I didn't have it
more than five minutes.

34:47.900 --> 34:48.777
Hello.

34:48.792 --> 34:50.473
That Rolls suits you.

34:52.762 --> 34:53.878
Simon ?

35:01.758 --> 35:04.889
He wanted me to give up the car.
"Seize it," they call it.

35:05.008 --> 35:08.049
DNA evidence tells us that you...

35:08.367 --> 35:10.053
bargained your way out of it.

35:11.167 --> 35:13.560
The only thing men
want more than toys...

35:22.154 --> 35:24.332
Well, from where I sit,
the problem is

35:24.332 --> 35:28.077
if you had access to Russell's Rolls,
then you also had access to his gun.

35:30.649 --> 35:32.592
Did you kill the tax man ?

35:33.280 --> 35:35.044
Why would I kill Simon ?

35:35.518 --> 35:37.689
To plant the gun, frame your ex,

35:37.835 --> 35:39.865
get rid of two birds with one stone.

35:39.955 --> 35:41.733
I didn't kill Simon.

35:42.231 --> 35:44.146
We both got what we wanted.

35:44.214 --> 35:47.024
So he just let you leave with a
quarter-million-dollar Rolls-Royce ?

35:47.113 --> 35:49.917
Yeah, and he was alive
and very happy.

35:51.496 --> 35:54.225
Look, I got out of there.
The place gave me the creeps.

35:54.341 --> 35:55.587
Why the creep s?

35:55.904 --> 35:57.368
Well, while we were...

35:57.726 --> 35:59.140
in the backseat,

35:59.337 --> 36:02.045
uh, I felt like someone was
watching us from outside the car.

36:03.744 --> 36:04.944
Wait, wait, wait.

36:05.441 --> 36:06.694
Did you hear anything ?

36:06.786 --> 36:07.733
Yeah, you.

36:10.044 --> 36:12.671
Look, unless either one of you
can prove that I pulled the trigger,

36:12.788 --> 36:13.880
I'm leaving.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.135
We'll be in touch.

36:23.467 --> 36:25.501
You think the husband
was watching...

36:26.053 --> 36:28.233
and he shot the IRS guy
out of jealousy?

36:28.640 --> 36:29.715
I don't know.

36:30.732 --> 36:32.854
Is the Rolls still in our garage?

36:56.203 --> 36:58.064
Hey, I got something.

37:15.427 --> 37:16.444
Saliva ?

37:16.647 --> 37:18.565
No, it's textured.

37:20.541 --> 37:23.103
It's all starting to come together.

37:23.534 --> 37:25.017
You're not going to tell me ?

37:25.337 --> 37:27.193
And let you run to Horatio with it ?

37:27.290 --> 37:28.526
Forget about it.

37:37.387 --> 37:39.912
See anything that looks
like a gun, Frank ?

37:39.912 --> 37:41.114
I'm still looking.

37:41.177 --> 37:42.021
Ma'am.

37:42.083 --> 37:43.153
Did you get my message ?

37:43.248 --> 37:43.831
I did.

37:43.943 --> 37:45.690
You got something
off the Rolls.

37:45.964 --> 37:49.011
Some mucus. I think someone
sneezed. I ran it through CODIS.

37:49.111 --> 37:50.035
You get any hits on it ?

37:50.142 --> 37:52.585
No. The only thing I can
tell you is the DNA is male.

37:52.585 --> 37:55.309
I'm working on a warrant to get
a sample from the jealous husband.

37:55.309 --> 37:57.137
- Okay, keep me posted.
- All right.

37:57.845 --> 37:58.546
Horatio.

37:59.080 --> 37:59.913
Yes, sir.

38:00.106 --> 38:03.389
I'm rolling snake eyes on the gun,
but I found a briefcase.

38:04.377 --> 38:05.671
Take a look at this.

38:08.581 --> 38:10.054
That is blood, Frank.

38:10.144 --> 38:11.463
Can't wash blood out of the stitching.

38:11.463 --> 38:14.529
No, you can't. Skip the gun.
We don't need it anymore.

38:42.808 --> 38:43.825
Mr. Dawson,

38:43.825 --> 38:46.077
would you please
take a look at that.

38:49.479 --> 38:51.339
Briefcase is mine.
I run a business.

38:51.432 --> 38:52.478
Is that a fact ?

38:52.943 --> 38:55.012
Well, that makes your initials...

38:55.314 --> 38:56.849
SLB.

38:58.264 --> 38:59.919
What are you getting at, Lieutenant ?

39:00.491 --> 39:02.746
The briefcase belongs
to Simon Bremmer.

39:02.746 --> 39:06.347
It was taken from his car
after he was killed.

39:06.430 --> 39:08.199
You can't prove I was
anywhere near there.

39:08.199 --> 39:11.152
No, I can't, but I can
prove Timothy was.

39:12.729 --> 39:15.033
Expectorant found
on the exterior

39:15.033 --> 39:18.331
of the Rolls-Royce
matches Timothy's DNA.

39:25.600 --> 39:26.879
Hey, wait, wait.

39:29.273 --> 39:30.924
I don't, I don't know, uh,

39:30.971 --> 39:32.830
why or how that was there,

39:32.861 --> 39:35.156
but you should be talking
to the guy who owns the Rolls,

39:35.229 --> 39:36.959
- not harassing my son...
- I was there, too.

39:37.062 --> 39:38.605
Seth, said don't say anything.

39:38.677 --> 39:40.486
Dad, he took away
your company yesterday,

39:40.486 --> 39:41.941
after he promised he wouldn't.

39:47.062 --> 39:48.311
What are you doing here ?

39:48.362 --> 39:50.594
I have a driver's permit.
We followed you.

39:50.739 --> 39:52.805
Seth, please don't talk.

39:52.891 --> 39:53.701
Doesn't matter.

39:53.912 --> 39:55.139
We're busted.

39:56.050 --> 39:58.043
You had your dad's gun ?

40:00.323 --> 40:01.790
It was an accident.

40:07.016 --> 40:08.669
So you shot him.

40:10.464 --> 40:13.140
Got rid of the files, so the IRS
wouldn't know about our dad.

40:23.960 --> 40:25.748
Okay. He's covering for me.

40:25.901 --> 40:27.532
He's covering for me.
I shot him.

40:27.591 --> 40:29.246
I killed him.
I did, I was there.

40:29.258 --> 40:30.624
Seth's lying.

40:31.769 --> 40:33.477
Timothy, shut up.

40:33.695 --> 40:35.329
I had the gun.

40:35.838 --> 40:37.763
If you don't give my
dad's business back,

40:37.763 --> 40:39.216
I'm gonna tell
what you did to her.

40:39.216 --> 40:41.287
You little monster.

40:43.511 --> 40:45.022
Timothy, where'd you get Dad's gun ?

40:57.598 --> 40:59.316
He hurt that lady.

40:59.411 --> 41:01.550
He was gonna hurt me and Seth.

41:08.909 --> 41:11.252
It was self-defense.
You heard him.

41:11.271 --> 41:14.365
- Simon was coming at them.
- Mr. Dawson, they killed a man.

41:15.232 --> 41:18.002
Please, they're just kids.

41:21.048 --> 41:23.664
The court will take that into account.

41:59.079 --> 42:00.717
The key to Russell's Rolls-Royce.

42:00.746 --> 42:03.722
I understand that your new job
is to seize his assets.

42:03.775 --> 42:06.377
I'm on probation since
my little shredder incident.

42:06.381 --> 42:07.719
So I hear.

42:08.110 --> 42:09.505
What do you want, Lieutenant ?

42:09.598 --> 42:11.304
Dawson's typo.

42:11.457 --> 42:12.463
Dawson?

42:12.761 --> 42:15.315
Typo or not, he kept accruing
interest he never paid.

42:15.413 --> 42:18.817
A clerical error that you
committed sent his family to hell.

42:18.926 --> 42:22.501
I want you to get out
your Wite-Out and correct it.

42:22.780 --> 42:24.052
Take a walk, Lieutenant.

42:24.387 --> 42:27.183
Miss Boone, does your
supervisor know

42:27.186 --> 42:31.596
that the check you shredded caused
a young man to kill somebody ?

42:36.566 --> 42:37.198
No.

42:37.459 --> 42:38.574
Surprising.

42:39.523 --> 42:42.367
I have your supervisor
on speed-dial.

42:43.111 --> 42:44.668
Do you want to call him ?

42:45.565 --> 42:46.684
Or should I ?

42:58.251 --> 42:59.049
Lieutenant.

42:59.657 --> 43:00.624
Mr. Dawson.

43:03.171 --> 43:04.268
You did this ?

43:05.105 --> 43:07.647
The City of Miami
did this, Mr. Dawson.

43:08.176 --> 43:08.994
Yeah.

43:10.481 --> 43:12.392
Yeah, but what about my boys ?

43:13.493 --> 43:15.302
I think your boys are
going to be fine.

43:15.383 --> 43:17.373
We're gonna get them
through this, aren't we ?

43:21.152 --> 43:23.888
I don't have much faith
in the system anymore.

43:25.942 --> 43:27.151
"By the people, for the people."

43:27.151 --> 43:29.471
You think they even care
about "the people" anymore ?

43:30.184 --> 43:31.540
Some of us do.

43:34.274 --> 43:35.709
Some of us do.
