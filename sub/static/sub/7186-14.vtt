Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:07.767 --> 01:08.767
Great!

01:08.769 --> 01:10.469
To start today's adventure,

01:10.471 --> 01:13.205
everybody say
the Pirate Password.

01:13.207 --> 01:14.706
Yo-ho-ho!

[Skully] Ahoy, me
costumed mateys!

01:29.423 --> 01:33.792
I spy a bug, a kitty,
and a werewolf!

01:33.794 --> 01:37.663
So whooo's ready to
trick or treasure?

01:37.665 --> 01:42.367
Me! I mean...
Me-ow! [laughs]

01:42.369 --> 01:47.172
Um, do you think we'll see
goblins, ghosts, and witches?

01:47.174 --> 01:48.841
And goblins?

01:48.843 --> 01:51.743
You never know, Cubby.
[chuckles]

01:51.745 --> 01:55.180
After all, it is Halloween
on Never Land.

01:55.182 --> 01:58.517
Hey, crew,
check out this treat.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.819
Peter Pan's
trick or treasure map.

02:00.821 --> 02:03.889
[Cubby] Awesome!
It has all the places
we're gonna visit tonight.

02:03.891 --> 02:07.192
Mermaid Lagoon,
Tiki Tree Forest,

02:07.194 --> 02:10.295
and the Great Pirate Pyramid
in the desert.

02:10.297 --> 02:14.766
And look!
It says here, "Trick-or-
treasure, it's your pick.

02:14.768 --> 02:18.570
If you get too greedy,
you only get the trick."

02:18.572 --> 02:20.606
What kind of trick?

02:20.608 --> 02:23.542
[chuckles] Peter always
leaves fun booby-traps

02:23.544 --> 02:25.410
to trick anyone
who tries to swipe

02:25.412 --> 02:27.246
the Halloween treat treasures.

02:27.248 --> 02:30.582
I sure don't want to get
tricked by any tricky-tricks.

02:30.584 --> 02:33.752
We'll be fine, as long
as we play by the rules,

02:33.754 --> 02:35.821
and only take
one treat treasure.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.257
That way, there'll
be enough for everybody.

02:38.259 --> 02:41.693
Say, mateys, will you
trick or treasure with us?

02:43.229 --> 02:46.665
Great! Remember to keep a
lookout for gold doubloons.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.935
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

02:49.937 --> 02:53.672
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.807
Is everybody ready?

02:55.809 --> 02:58.610
- I've got my sword.
- I got my map!

02:58.612 --> 03:00.913
And I've got
my pixie dust.

03:00.915 --> 03:04.449
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

03:04.451 --> 03:06.552
But only in emergencies.

03:06.554 --> 03:10.255
Yo-ho! Let's go
trick or treasure!

03:13.726 --> 03:16.695

03:19.233 --> 03:20.599
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

03:20.601 --> 03:23.769

<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

03:26.907 --> 03:29.208

03:30.877 --> 03:33.478
[Smee] Oooh, Mermaid Lagoon,

03:33.480 --> 03:35.714
[chuckles]
Tiki Tree Forest,

03:35.716 --> 03:38.784
[gasps] and the
Great Pirate Pyramid.

03:38.786 --> 03:42.754
Mr. Smee, where did
you get that treasure map?

03:42.756 --> 03:45.724
Why, it's a trick or
treasure map, Captain.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.694
Peter Pan sends it to us
every Halloween.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.896
Oh, pish posh!
What is all this

03:50.898 --> 03:53.665
"trick or treasure"
nonsense anyway?

03:53.667 --> 03:57.302
Trick or treasure is when people
hand out treat treasures

03:57.304 --> 03:59.004
to everyone in costumes.

03:59.006 --> 04:03.308
They just hand out
treat-treasures?

04:03.310 --> 04:06.278
Oh, yes, and lots
of it too, lots!

04:06.280 --> 04:08.480
Smee...

04:08.482 --> 04:12.651
...for the first time in all
me life, I, Captain Hook,

04:12.653 --> 04:15.954
intend to trick or treasure.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.557
[laughing]
Oh, that's wonderful, Captain.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.959
But I'm not just taking
the treat-treasures

04:20.961 --> 04:23.729
that are handed
to me, no, no...

04:23.731 --> 04:27.399
I'm taking all the
treat-treasures!

04:27.401 --> 04:31.436
That's right, you're
taking all the... Wha...

04:31.438 --> 04:33.972
[sigh] Oh, dear.

04:36.576 --> 04:39.344
[Jake] First stop,
Mermaid Lagoon.

04:39.979 --> 04:41.913
[doorbell rings]

04:42.715 --> 04:44.716
[all] Trick or treasure!

04:44.718 --> 04:45.951
Happy Halloween.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.587
Or as we mermaids call it,
"Shell-oween"

04:48.589 --> 04:53.525
- [giggles]
- Coconut? Mmm. My favorite.

04:53.527 --> 04:54.893
[Hook] Mine, too.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.396
[all gasping]
Captain Hook?

04:57.398 --> 05:00.799
[chuckles] How did
you know it was me?

05:00.801 --> 05:02.567
Uhh, I don't know.

05:02.569 --> 05:04.836
The mustache?
The hook? Uh...

05:04.838 --> 05:07.973
- Yes, yes, I get it.
- Wow, Captain Hook.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.842
We've never seen you out
trick or treasuring before.

05:10.844 --> 05:14.546
Can you believe it?
It's his first time.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.548
Just remember the rules.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.817
Start by saying
"Trick or treasure"!

05:18.819 --> 05:21.453
Never take all the
treat-treasures.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.855
And always say "thank you"!

05:23.857 --> 05:25.724
Oh, please.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.760
I'm not interested
in silly "rules."

05:28.762 --> 05:32.964
I'm only interested in
getting the treat-treasures.

05:32.966 --> 05:33.965
Happy Hallow...

05:33.967 --> 05:36.968
I'll take that
me little mer-matey.

05:36.970 --> 05:37.969
[vine snaps]

05:37.971 --> 05:40.839
- What's this?
- It's a trick.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.909
[Hook grunts] Blast...

05:45.345 --> 05:46.812
[Izzy] Shiver me bones!

05:46.814 --> 05:49.681
We can't go in there
to save the treat-treasures.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.383
That coral is sharp.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.585
But... how can we get 'em back?

05:53.587 --> 05:56.988
I know! We can make
a lasso out of seaweed,

05:56.990 --> 05:58.990
and save Stormy's bowl.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.931
- Yay!
- Way to go, Jake!

06:05.933 --> 06:07.999
- Woo-hoo!
- Goody-goldfish!

06:08.001 --> 06:11.970
Yay-hey, we saved Stormy's bowl
of treat-treasures,

06:11.972 --> 06:13.939
and we got two gold doubloons.

06:13.941 --> 06:17.008
Let's grab 'em and go.

06:18.144 --> 06:22.447
We're going too, Smee.
Hold on tightly.

06:22.449 --> 06:26.051
[Smee] Holding, Captain,
holding!

06:26.053 --> 06:27.819
Thanks for
helping me, friends.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.088
And have fun
trick or treasuring!

06:32.024 --> 06:33.825
Now, Captain,
we don't want to

06:33.827 --> 06:36.461
spring another
Halloween booby-trap.

06:36.463 --> 06:37.829
Of course not.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.866
So you distract
these wooden-heads,

06:40.868 --> 06:42.834
and I'll scoop all the

06:42.836 --> 06:45.670
treat-treasures
into me loot bag.

06:45.672 --> 06:48.173
[stammering] But, Captain,
couldn't we...

06:48.175 --> 06:51.042
- Ugh...
- What's this then?

06:51.044 --> 06:54.012
Aren't you a little old
for trick or treasure?

06:54.014 --> 06:57.649
Oh, you're never too old
for trick or treasure.

06:57.651 --> 07:01.453
In fact, I'm going to the
Great Pirate Pyramid next.

07:01.455 --> 07:03.889
Is that walking distance
from here?

07:03.891 --> 07:06.658
Everywhere is
walking distance...

07:06.660 --> 07:10.028
...if you have legs.
[laughs]

07:10.030 --> 07:14.132
Now, where are they hiding
those treat-treasures?

07:14.134 --> 07:17.636
Crackers! What's
old Feather Hat doing?

07:17.638 --> 07:19.638
[Cubby] What he's
always doing...

07:19.640 --> 07:20.906
...being sneaky!

07:20.908 --> 07:22.574
And I betcha
he's gonna trip

07:22.576 --> 07:24.109
another one of
Peter's tricks.

07:24.111 --> 07:28.013
- Ah, the treat-treasures!
- Captain Hook, wait!

07:28.015 --> 07:30.782
Ahh!

07:30.784 --> 07:32.217
- Ooh! Ahh!
- [Smee groans]

07:34.987 --> 07:38.590
Whoa! That trick
really blew me away!

07:38.859 --> 07:44.963
- We've gotta get Jake down.
- Maybe the Tiki Trees can help.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.531
Excuse me?

07:46.533 --> 07:50.902
Mr. Tiki Tree, could you
please help us get Jake down?

07:50.904 --> 07:52.471
Sure thing, lad.

07:52.473 --> 07:55.974
- Come on, boys.
- Let's lend a branch.

07:56.876 --> 07:59.678
- Watch your step.
- Thanks, Tikis.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.881
Yay-hey!
We got Jake down safely,

08:02.883 --> 08:05.116
and we got two more
gold doubloons.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.819
Let's grab 'em and go.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.721
Go? [chuckles]

08:09.723 --> 08:11.857
Aren't you forgetting
something, man?

08:11.859 --> 08:14.192
Huh? Oh, yeah!

08:14.194 --> 08:15.927
[all] Trick or treasure!

08:15.929 --> 08:18.063
[laughs]

08:18.065 --> 08:22.501
Help yourselves and
have a happy Halloween.

08:22.503 --> 08:23.902
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.071
- Thanks.
- Yo-ho!

08:26.939 --> 08:30.008
Captain Hook,
Mr. Smee, you OK?

08:30.010 --> 08:31.877
Yes, yes, we're fine.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.912
We're just, uh...

08:33.914 --> 08:37.549
...taking a break from
all this Halloween hilarity.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.784
May I suggest, sir,

08:39.786 --> 08:41.920
[stammers] it might be
more fun if we tried to just

08:41.922 --> 08:43.955
trick or treasure
like the sea pups.

08:43.957 --> 08:47.025
[chuckles] Taking only
our fair share.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.829
Well...
all right, fine.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.998
This time, I won't take
all the treat-treasures

08:53.000 --> 08:54.933
from the
tricky-treasure bowl.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.801
Good for you,
Captain Hook.

08:56.803 --> 08:59.871
[chuckles] I'm proud
of you too, sir.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.908
Well, yes, you see...

09:02.910 --> 09:06.645
I won't steal all the
treat-treasures from the bowl...

09:06.647 --> 09:10.715
I'll let Jake and his puny
pirates get theirs first,

09:10.717 --> 09:14.553
and then I'll steal the
treat-treasures from them.

09:14.555 --> 09:15.954
Oh, dear!

09:15.956 --> 09:18.790
[Skully] Jumpin'
Jack-o-lanterns!

09:18.792 --> 09:22.961
Captain Flynn's Pirate
Pyramid sure is Halloweeny.

09:22.963 --> 09:25.096
It certainly is.

09:25.098 --> 09:28.266
Oh, but where
are my manners?

09:28.268 --> 09:33.305
Step aside, Mr. Smee,
puny pirates first.

09:33.307 --> 09:37.876
Gee, Captain Hook
sure is being nice.

09:37.878 --> 09:43.848
- Yeah, almost too nice.
- [cackling] Happy Halloweeen.

09:43.850 --> 09:46.251
[laughs] Captain Flynn!

09:46.253 --> 09:48.086
- Whoa!
- [Izzy laughs]

09:48.088 --> 09:49.955
- Good one!
- Crackers!

09:49.957 --> 09:53.124
- Whaddaya say, mateys?
- [all] Trick or treasure!

09:56.862 --> 09:59.130
- Trick-or-tre...
- Captain Hook!

09:59.132 --> 10:01.800
What might
he be doin' here?

10:01.802 --> 10:04.869
Oh, just enjoying
the holiday.

10:04.871 --> 10:06.338
Boo! [chuckles]

10:06.340 --> 10:09.941
Well, there's plenty of
treat-treasures for everybody.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.743
Even you, Hook.

10:11.745 --> 10:14.346
See, Captain Hook,
you don't have to steal

10:14.348 --> 10:16.948
all the treat-treasures
to have a good time.

10:16.950 --> 10:20.151
- Maybe you don't, but I do!
- [all] Hey!

10:20.153 --> 10:22.921
- Blow me down!
- Those are our treasure bags!

10:22.923 --> 10:25.824
[chuckles] I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

10:25.826 --> 10:28.627
Well, you're not... me.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.362
- [bell dings]
- [Hook, Smee yell]

10:31.731 --> 10:34.332
[Jake] Oh, no! Our
trick or treasure bags!

10:34.334 --> 10:37.836
This is some kind of
an emergency, all right.

10:37.838 --> 10:40.772
Then it's
pixie dust time!

10:42.708 --> 10:46.077
Yay-hey! We got back our
trick or treasure bags,

10:46.079 --> 10:48.346
and we got three gold doubloons.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.015
Let's grab 'em and go.

10:50.916 --> 10:53.018
[all] Bye, Captain Flynn!

10:53.020 --> 10:54.886
Thanks for the
treat-treasures.

10:54.888 --> 10:58.056
Happy Halloween, kiddos!

11:00.326 --> 11:03.161
Thanks for going
trick-or-treasuring
with us, mateys.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.163
Now, let's count
our gold doubloons,

11:05.165 --> 11:07.666
and put them in our
Team Treasure Chest.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.042
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:17.044 --> 11:19.044
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:19.046 --> 11:21.146
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

11:21.148 --> 11:23.948
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons! ¶</i>

11:23.950 --> 11:26.317
Come on. Count with us.

11:27.787 --> 11:29.120
[all] Yeah!

11:30.256 --> 11:31.990
[Jake] One, two...

11:31.992 --> 11:33.858
[Cubby] Three, four...

11:33.860 --> 11:36.761
[Izzy] Five, six, seven!

11:36.763 --> 11:39.898
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

11:39.900 --> 11:42.033
we got seven gold doubloons.

11:43.302 --> 11:47.005
We sure got a lot of Halloween
treat-treasures this year.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.741
[all] Happy Halloween!

11:50.910 --> 11:52.410
[Hook] Finally...

11:52.412 --> 11:57.382
...this ridiculous
Halloween night is over.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.885
Oh, Mr. Smee,
take that silly costume off.

12:00.887 --> 12:04.122
- I told you, it's over.
- Beg your pardon, Captain?

12:04.124 --> 12:07.125
- [Tic-Tock Croc chuckles]
- [stammers] What?

12:07.127 --> 12:09.427
- [Hook yells] Smee!
- [Tic-Tock Croc chomps]

12:09.429 --> 12:12.831
- [Hook] Save me!
- [Tic-Tock Croc laughs]

12:15.167 --> 12:17.902
[Jake] Season of the Sea Witch.

12:17.904 --> 12:21.172
Ah, coconuts!
The fish aren't biting.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.007
- I think they're on vacation.
- [gurgling]

12:23.009 --> 12:26.811
Look alive!
Here comes a big one.

12:26.813 --> 12:28.913
[gurgling]

12:28.915 --> 12:32.317
Woo-hoo! It's Cecilia,
the sea serpent.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.819
[Izzy] And she's got a message.

12:36.756 --> 12:40.458
It says, "To you,
my friends, ahoy I say,

12:40.460 --> 12:44.963
it's the Pirate Princess.
I need your help today.

12:44.965 --> 12:48.366
The wicked Sea Witch is back,
please don't delay.

12:48.368 --> 12:51.336
Come to my castle,
right away."

12:51.338 --> 12:53.772
[stammers] Sea Witch?

12:53.774 --> 12:56.407
- That's no good.
- Shiver me timbers!

12:56.409 --> 12:58.943
We need to go to
Pirate Princess Island.

12:58.945 --> 13:02.313
Will you come with us
to help the Pirate Princess?

13:04.316 --> 13:08.820
Great! Remember to keep a
lookout for gold doubloons.

13:08.822 --> 13:11.990
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

13:11.992 --> 13:15.560
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

13:15.562 --> 13:18.096
Yo-ho, let's go!

13:21.167 --> 13:24.002
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

13:24.004 --> 13:26.571
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

13:26.573 --> 13:31.276
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

13:31.278 --> 13:34.245
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

13:34.247 --> 13:36.247
<i>¶ And me </i>

13:38.384 --> 13:42.220
Follow that serpent to
Pirate Princess Island!

13:42.222 --> 13:45.290
[Izzy] I can't wait to see
the Pirate Princess again.

13:46.292 --> 13:49.360
A-ha! Did you hear that,
Mr. Smee?

13:49.362 --> 13:51.262
Jake and his
little sea slugs

13:51.264 --> 13:53.898
are going to Pirate
Princess Island.

13:53.900 --> 13:57.569
Oh, I hear it's quite lovely
there this time of year.

13:57.571 --> 14:00.138
Bah! All I care about

14:00.140 --> 14:02.941
is if there's any
treasure on that island.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.944
Well, I have heard
that the Pirate Princess

14:05.946 --> 14:08.046
has a purse
filled with diamonds.

14:08.048 --> 14:12.183
Diamonds!
Now we're talkin' treasure.

14:21.627 --> 14:24.162
[all] Ahoy, Pirate Princess!

14:24.164 --> 14:27.365
Ahoy, friends.
I'm so glad you came.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.634
How can we help our royal matey?

14:29.636 --> 14:31.502
Remember the
wicked Sea Witch

14:31.504 --> 14:34.439
who turned me into a statue
of gold so I couldn't move?

14:34.441 --> 14:36.274
[gasps] Is the Sea Witch

14:36.276 --> 14:38.576
trying to turn you
into gold again?

14:38.578 --> 14:43.047
I'm not sure, but she wants to
make Never Land a gloomy place.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.083
And I know
how to stop her.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.252
With my Rainbow Wand.

14:48.587 --> 14:52.257
Its colorful magic will
turn her into a nice witch.

14:52.259 --> 14:57.195
Warts and worms...
I'm not letting that perky

14:57.197 --> 15:00.932
little princess
zap me with her rainbows.

15:00.934 --> 15:06.037
This time, I'll turn her
into a gold statue forever.

15:06.039 --> 15:10.975
And not even Jake and
his sea rats will stop me.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.110
[cackling]

15:16.115 --> 15:17.649
[Izzy] OK, Pirate Princess,

15:17.651 --> 15:19.350
I know how we
can trick the witch,

15:19.352 --> 15:21.686
so you can use
your Rainbow Wand.

15:21.688 --> 15:24.923
Ta-dah!
What do ya' think?

15:24.925 --> 15:26.958
You look just like me.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.993
Yep, and by the time
the sea witch

15:28.995 --> 15:32.964
realizes that I'm not
the real Pirate Princess,

15:32.966 --> 15:35.934
you'll have turned her
into a nice witch.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.402
Great idea, Izzy.

15:37.404 --> 15:41.039
Or should I say
"Pirate Princess" Izzy.

15:41.573 --> 15:43.141
Is everybody ready?

15:43.143 --> 15:46.110
- [males] Aye-aye!
- Ready as a rainbow.

15:46.112 --> 15:50.148
If the Sea Witch shows up,
we'll be right here.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.150
Now, we wait.

15:52.152 --> 15:55.286
- [grunting, groaning]
- We won't have to wait long.

15:55.288 --> 15:59.023
[Smee] I can't believe we
got past that sea serpent.

15:59.025 --> 16:03.094
[Hook] Quiet, Smee, or we'll
lose the element of surprise.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.996
[Smee yelps]

16:04.998 --> 16:06.431
Blast!

16:06.433 --> 16:10.268
That's not the Sea Witch,
that's old Feather Hat.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.636
[stammers]
Sorry, Captain.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.038
May I help you?

16:14.040 --> 16:18.109
Oh, greetings,
Pirate Princess.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.244
It's so good to see you.

16:20.246 --> 16:22.981
What is your business here, sir?

16:22.983 --> 16:25.616
I want your purse of diamonds!

16:25.618 --> 16:27.151
Yay-hey, no way!

16:27.153 --> 16:31.089
Say, you don't sound
like the princess.

16:31.091 --> 16:34.692
You sound just like
a puny pirate I know.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.661
Sorry, Hook,
but you'd better leave.

16:36.663 --> 16:40.465
A-ha! More puny pirates.
I knew it.

16:40.467 --> 16:43.101
Listen, you don't
want to be around here

16:43.103 --> 16:48.106
I'm not going anywhere
without those diamonds.

16:48.108 --> 16:51.376
Oh, Captain Hook,
if you want the diamonds,

16:51.378 --> 16:53.711
you might try pulling
the Royal Ribbon.

16:54.713 --> 16:56.481
That's more like it.

16:56.483 --> 17:00.284
Thank you, Pirate Princess.
Try I shall.

17:00.286 --> 17:04.088
- [horn honks]
- [Smee] Oh, dear!

17:04.090 --> 17:07.592
Yay-hey! We got Captain Hook
to slide away.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.727
And we got two gold doubloons.

17:09.729 --> 17:13.398
Let's grab 'em, and go back
to helping the Pirate Princess.

17:15.401 --> 17:20.038
- [both yell]
- [snoring]

17:20.040 --> 17:22.707
Oh, dear, with that
beastie around,

17:22.709 --> 17:25.510
how are we ever going to
get back in the castle?

17:25.512 --> 17:29.414
Eh, that puny pirate, Izzy,

17:29.416 --> 17:33.084
gave me a royal idea.

17:33.452 --> 17:35.319
Um, Captain?

17:35.321 --> 17:37.789
Are you sure
this is going to work?

17:37.791 --> 17:42.126
If it doesn't,
we're serpent supper.
[clears throat]

17:42.128 --> 17:45.797
[in feminine voice] Oh, dear,
I, the Pirate Princess,

17:45.799 --> 17:49.834
have locked meself out
of me own castle, yee-hee.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.769
Could you be a dear
and let me in?

17:51.771 --> 17:52.804
[mutters]

17:52.806 --> 17:56.174
Thank you serpent, sweetie.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.709
[cackling]

17:59.778 --> 18:02.447
- Oh-oh.
- Shiver me timbers.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.115
- Ah, coconuts!
- Crackers!

18:04.117 --> 18:07.452
Shadowy shores. The Sea Witch!

18:09.588 --> 18:13.458
[cackling] You thought
you could keep me away?

18:13.460 --> 18:18.863
Now, I shall turn you into
a statue of gold... forever.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.866
- I don't think so!
- [zaps]

18:21.868 --> 18:25.670
You're not the Pirate Princess.

18:25.672 --> 18:28.806
You're one of those
meddling sea rats!

18:28.808 --> 18:31.275
[grunts, gasps]

18:31.277 --> 18:35.113
[stammering]
The Sea Witch... is real?

18:35.115 --> 18:36.714
A-ha!

18:36.716 --> 18:40.384
So there you are,
Pirate Princess.

18:40.386 --> 18:44.722
Now, I will turn you into
a statue of gold forever!

18:44.724 --> 18:47.758
Wait! I'm not a princess!

18:47.760 --> 18:53.498
You silly Sea Witch, that wasn't
the Pirate Princess either.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.601
- That was Captain Hook.
- Warts and worms!

18:56.603 --> 18:59.804
How many Pirate
Princesses are there?

18:59.806 --> 19:01.606
[Pirate Princess]
There's only one!

19:01.608 --> 19:04.408
And I'm not afraid of you,
Sea Witch.

19:05.677 --> 19:08.613
I'll get you yet. [cackles]

19:09.515 --> 19:12.850
- My wand!
- [grunts] Got it!

19:12.852 --> 19:14.785
Hurry, princess.
We'll meet you back

19:14.787 --> 19:17.455
in your chamber after
we stop the Sea Witch.

19:17.457 --> 19:20.158
Good luck,
pirate friends!

19:20.160 --> 19:24.695
If you want to stop me,
you'll have to catch me first.

19:24.697 --> 19:28.933
But how can you stop
something you cannot see?

19:28.935 --> 19:30.801
[cackling]

19:32.204 --> 19:35.773
[stammering] Boy,
it sure is dark in here.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.743
Crackers! If only
we had some light.

19:38.745 --> 19:41.512
Well, we have the Rainbow Wand,

19:41.514 --> 19:44.248
and the Rainbow Wand
makes rainbow light.

19:44.250 --> 19:44.715
Lets give it a whirl.

19:48.654 --> 19:52.456
Yay-hey, we used the
Rainbow Wand to light our way.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.859
And we got three more
gold doubloons.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.962
Let's grab 'em and
go stop the Sea Witch.

20:01.733 --> 20:05.436
There, with the door locked,
now the Sea Witch can't get me,

20:05.438 --> 20:06.871
and turn me into gold.

20:06.873 --> 20:10.441
[Sea Witch] Oh,
Pirate Princess...

20:10.443 --> 20:14.879
You locked the door,
but not the window.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.581
[cackling]

20:16.583 --> 20:19.483
[Skully] I spy
Sea Witch in the sky.

20:19.485 --> 20:22.520
Izzy, this is
an emergency!

20:22.522 --> 20:24.488
Then it's pixie dust away.

20:27.759 --> 20:29.527
[gurgling]

20:29.529 --> 20:32.730
Now, pretty princess,
behold!

20:32.732 --> 20:37.268
I shall turn you into
a statue of gold, forever!

20:37.270 --> 20:39.570
Princess, catch!

20:40.239 --> 20:42.573
[grunts] Rainbows away!

20:43.542 --> 20:45.610
What's happening?

20:46.945 --> 20:52.416
Oh, my! I feel so different.
Ah, what a wonderful switch!

20:52.418 --> 20:56.487
Now you can call me Misty Misty,
the wonderful witch.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.489
Oh, thank you,
Pirate Princess.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.825
You've changed my life...
forever.

21:00.827 --> 21:06.731
Shiver me rainbows, we turned
the Sea Witch into a nice witch,

21:06.733 --> 21:09.267
and got three more
gold doubloons.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.035
Let's grab 'em and go.

21:12.804 --> 21:14.372
Thank you, Misty.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.941
And thank you,
brave pirate Izzy.

21:16.943 --> 21:20.845
You can pretend
to be me anytime.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.613
Wow, thanks.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.449
But, there's only one
Pirate Princess.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.752
And there's
only one Izzy.

21:27.754 --> 21:30.054
But what about old Feather Hat?

21:30.056 --> 21:32.890
Can't we just leave him
like this for a while?

21:32.892 --> 21:36.460
Changing him back
is the right thing to do.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.896
- Even for Captain Hook.
- [all laughing]

21:38.898 --> 21:41.432
Um, hello?

21:42.834 --> 21:45.836
Thanks for helping the
Pirate Princess today, mateys.

21:45.838 --> 21:48.339
Now, let's put
all our gold doubloons

21:48.341 --> 21:50.074
into our Team Treasure Chest.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.750
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

21:59.752 --> 22:01.719
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

22:01.721 --> 22:03.888
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

22:03.890 --> 22:06.824
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons! ¶</i>

22:06.826 --> 22:08.926
Come on. Count with us.

22:09.928 --> 22:11.495
[all] Yeah!

22:13.098 --> 22:16.801
[Cubby] One, two, three, four...

22:16.803 --> 22:19.904
[Izzy] Five, six,
seven, eight...

22:19.906 --> 22:23.674
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

22:23.676 --> 22:26.577
we got eight gold doubloons.

22:26.579 --> 22:30.981
And we got our very own
princess of Pirate Island!

22:31.883 --> 22:33.918
[all laugh]

22:33.920 --> 22:36.587
But... what about
old Feather Hat?

22:38.924 --> 22:41.859
Oh, Smee, what a
horrible experience.

22:41.861 --> 22:47.732
I never want to see that
horrible Sea Witch ever again.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.934
Blast! It's the Sea Witch!

22:49.936 --> 22:52.570
And she brought
her sisters!

22:52.572 --> 22:55.673
Save me, Smee! Smee!

22:58.009 --> 23:01.979
- Why, it's only us, Captain.
- Trick or treasure.
