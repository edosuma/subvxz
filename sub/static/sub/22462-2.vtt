MARK: There she is, hovering ominously -
Dobby's yellow head.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.030
I'm not about to masturbate
looking at the head.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.559
That's what they want me to do.

00:26.600 --> 00:30.355
Hm, same Noodle Bar she went to yesterday,
and Tuesday.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.198
What's going on at the Noodle Bar?

00:32.240 --> 00:35.790
Three-star reviews.
It's possible she just likes the food.

00:35.840 --> 00:37.274
But hard to completely believe.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.231
Mark, can I put the heating on?
I'm freezing.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.112
No. Wear a jumper, walk about.

00:41.160 --> 00:44.994
You want me to stride about the flat
covered in wool simply to stay alive?

00:45.040 --> 00:46.474
- New York?
- Uh-huh.

00:46.520 --> 00:49.797
Seems Dobby never deleted me
off her Find My Friends app.

00:49.840 --> 00:51.717
This is your perfect way
of going out with someone, isn't it?

00:51.760 --> 00:54.115
Safe in your sexual GCHQ.

00:54.160 --> 00:55.958
I'm trying to build up a picture
of her mental state.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.595
For example, there's this organic bakery
she's been to this afternoon

00:59.640 --> 01:00.869
and twice more this week.

01:00.920 --> 01:03.753
I checked their Twitter
and their carrot cake just ran out.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.838
The other day, she was in
and the same thing happened.

01:06.880 --> 01:08.154
It could be a coincidence.

01:08.200 --> 01:11.431
I'm not saying she's eating a whole
carrot cake every time she goes in there.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.278
But you've got to admit, it's interesting.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.880
Fascinating. Here's a radical idea.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.991
Why don't you stop being a psycho
and give her a ring?

01:18.040 --> 01:21.510
She stopped answering my calls
after I went a bit overboard that time.

01:21.560 --> 01:22.709
The million-text month?

01:22.760 --> 01:23.795
Mm. So unfair.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.195
The 327-text month.

01:26.240 --> 01:27.753
Put it back, Jeremy.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.598
That thing eats electricity.

01:29.640 --> 01:32.871
It's only seven hours
till the central heating comes back on.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.196
It's going in the vault. The new regime.

01:35.240 --> 01:40.155
Heater in the cupboard, tracker tag on
the nice towel, mousetrap in the Frosties.

01:41.520 --> 01:42.669
It's great you do home visits.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.678
I find it makes for a more conducive
life-coaching environment.

01:45.720 --> 01:49.600
Than you at my place, my socks
on the radiator and me sitting on a bongo.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.280
- I've done some more art boxes.
- Megan's so lovely.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.799
I'm definitely falling in love with her.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.195
But what the hell's she talking about?

01:56.240 --> 01:57.469
Focus. I need to give her

01:57.520 --> 02:01.229
a really useful, usable bit
of actual handcrafted wisdom that...

02:01.280 --> 02:03.112
Ooh, is that Watchmen?
I never saw Watchmen.

02:03.160 --> 02:04.230
(DOOR OPENS)

02:04.280 --> 02:06.954
Sorry I'm back so early. I'll, um...
I'll hide out in the bedroom.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.674
No, it's OK.
Jeremy, this is Joe, my boyfriend.

02:09.720 --> 02:10.949
Oh, hey, Joe.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.276
He's eyeing me. There's an atmosphere.

02:13.320 --> 02:15.436
Does he want to hit me?

02:15.480 --> 02:16.709
Jeremy was just saying
I should quit my job

02:16.760 --> 02:19.036
and concentrate,
like, 100% on my boxes.

02:19.080 --> 02:20.753
- Fuck, did I?
- JOE: Really?

02:20.800 --> 02:22.313
Wow, that's a... That's a big one.

02:22.360 --> 02:25.273
- Sure. Big call.
- Quite the wise old guru.

02:25.320 --> 02:27.470
Hey, less of the "old", young man.

02:27.520 --> 02:31.195
I'm still young enough
to give you a... bloody good... duffing up.

02:31.240 --> 02:35.950
We're not gonna fight, but I reckon
I could duff him up, if I needed to.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.719
Take him out, take him apart,
sort him out big-time.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.593
I could... take him, definitely.

02:41.640 --> 02:42.914
If I needed to.

02:44.440 --> 02:47.432
- Thanks for seeing me, Mark. Mate.
- No problem.

02:47.480 --> 02:51.951
Mate? He wants my... liver for a transplant?
Well, he can't have it.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.957
And I'm saving my kidneys for little Ian.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.070
Look, um...

02:55.120 --> 02:58.351
I don't think I've ever said this before,
but I've got a huge...

02:58.400 --> 03:00.357
huge amount of respect for you, yeah?

03:00.400 --> 03:03.153
When UKIP come to round us all up,
you'll be there,

03:03.200 --> 03:05.350
Won't you, at the barricades,
saying, "No!"

03:05.400 --> 03:07.994
Oh, that's...
that's very nice of you to say, Hans.

03:08.040 --> 03:10.111
Yeah. So, er... Well, it's like this.

03:10.160 --> 03:13.437
Er, I want you to be best man
at me wedding.

03:13.480 --> 03:14.914
Best man?

03:14.960 --> 03:16.473
- But what about Jez?
- Molly hates him.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.557
I need a... norm.

03:18.600 --> 03:22.070
And you, well, you're a real meat
and potatoes, straight up and down,

03:22.120 --> 03:25.909
beef Wellington, don't trust the Argies,
dick in the vagina,

03:25.960 --> 03:29.396
Cheddar cheese
and chicken tikka masala man.

03:29.440 --> 03:30.589
Thank you?

03:30.640 --> 03:34.235
There is nothing that could persuade me
to strap myself to the huge,

03:34.280 --> 03:38.956
flaming Super Hans wedding zeppelin
with a gang of drugged-up goons.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.911
Oh, hang on.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.917
Is... Dobby invited?

03:42.960 --> 03:44.234
Er, yeah.

03:44.280 --> 03:46.874
We've got a "no smackheads,
no crackheads" rule, so, the, er...

03:46.920 --> 03:48.433
the old long list is pretty short.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.676
I mean, I'd love to come.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.712
But maybe without being your best man.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.149
(LAUGHS) Yeah, I bet you would,
you cheeky fucker.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.316
No, you're gonna have to earn
your rack of lamb, buddy.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.397
Oh, strap on the cummerbund.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.473
Need to professionalise in here.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.478
Lose the lions, put up my certificate,
get a filing cabinet.

04:06.520 --> 04:08.511
Except, have I got anything to f...?

04:08.560 --> 04:09.789
What is that?

04:09.840 --> 04:12.150
Watt, is that a fucking thermometer?

04:12.200 --> 04:13.838
He's finally bloody lost it.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.119
- Hello.
- Hello.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.435
- What are you doing?
- Just taking a temperature reading.

04:20.480 --> 04:23.074
I thought perhaps
you'd bought your own fan heater.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.269
Oh, for fuck's sake!

04:24.320 --> 04:28.473
I need to get off for Fakenham, to
be there the night before, for... everything.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.591
- He's in his jacket, going to everything.
- While I'm gone,

04:30.640 --> 04:32.995
no turning the central heating
to constant.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.556
- So, off you go, the best man.
- I'm sorry, Jez.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.352
The single best man there is.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.597
You know they haven't even invited me
to the ceremony, just the reception.

04:41.640 --> 04:44.109
I only said yes because of Dobby.
To win her back.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.071
...I need to get back to the good times.

04:46.120 --> 04:49.590
Hours on the sofa,
DVD's and takeaway lamb pasanda.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.950
I'm gonna be the Mark
Dobby always wanted,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.560
who goes to those
spoken-word poetry events

04:54.600 --> 04:59.071
where most of the poems are by women
about the awesome power of the C-U-N-T.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.997
You can't even say it.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.678
There's enough unpleasantness
in the world.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.279
See you tomorrow.

05:05.840 --> 05:09.720
I have so many funny stories
about Hans, where do I start?

05:09.760 --> 05:12.593
The time he tried to cut my legs off
when he was tripping

05:12.640 --> 05:15.029
because he thought! was a demon?
Or the time

05:15.080 --> 05:18.869
he just went straight for me with
a chicken skewer for no apparent reason?

05:18.920 --> 05:20.433
Shit, Dobby's off-grid.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.756
She could be anywhere. So selfish.

05:22.800 --> 05:26.236
Quick neighbourhood watch
over my own personal neighbourhood,

05:26.280 --> 05:29.079
then maybe a disappointing Skype chat
with my son.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.476
There's nothing unethical
about secretly filming my own flat.

05:32.520 --> 05:34.989
If he's got nothing to hide,
he's got nothing to fear.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.350
A vest? That heat-thieving bastard.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.756
I should put a mousetrap in there.
That'd be fun.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.314
- (PHONE RINGS)
- It's time for the show trial.

05:43.360 --> 05:46.591
I'm gonna make him confess
his thermostat crimes.

05:46.640 --> 05:49.280
The heating Stasi
are coming for you, Jeremy.

05:49.320 --> 05:51.596
Oh, hey, Mark.
How's the advance party going?

05:51.640 --> 05:55.474
Oh, good, Jeremy. You?
You're looking quite <i>toasty</i> over there.

05:55.520 --> 05:58.194
- Er, yeah, well, it was quite a warm day.
- Oh, really?

05:58.240 --> 05:59.958
Not according to the Met Office, it's not.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.070
Microclimate.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.316
There is no microclimate
around Apollo House.

06:03.360 --> 06:04.759
Well, that would explain

06:04.800 --> 06:07.076
- why I'm feeling quite chilly now.
- You don't look chilly.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.758
- Brr.
- Bullshit.

06:08.800 --> 06:12.998
It's an hour outside the agreed heating
window and the flat looks incredibly warm.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.351
- How could it look warm, you maniac?
- (DOORBELL RINGS)

06:16.400 --> 06:17.834
Who's that?

06:17.880 --> 06:19.917
Oh, that'll be the ISIS guys
that I've invited round

06:19.960 --> 06:22.395
- to charge their mobiles on your coin.
- Don't joke.

06:22.440 --> 06:23.669
Now, turn the heating off,

06:23.720 --> 06:26.280
put a jumper on and text me
a picture of you wearing it

06:26.320 --> 06:28.994
in front of the thermostat
with today's paper.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.353
- Hey.
- Oh, hi,

06:33.400 --> 06:35.755
Er, wondered if you had time
for a bit of life coaching,

06:35.800 --> 06:38.235
um... off the clock.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.839
Sure.

06:39.880 --> 06:43.191
Hey, I know what the weird atmosphere is.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.990
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Coming, Hans.

06:46.040 --> 06:46.950
Oh, God, Dobby.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.593
- Hi.
- Wow!

06:48.640 --> 06:50.870
Did you just arrive?
Did-Did your phone die?

06:50.920 --> 06:53.036
Er, yeah, it did. How did you know?

06:53.080 --> 06:54.878
Great to see you.

06:54.920 --> 06:56.115
I just wanted to say hi

06:56.160 --> 07:00.040
and head off any potential weirdness
by being as weird as possible right now.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.117
So... rarrgh!

07:02.160 --> 07:04.549
Good option. Blaaaargh!

07:04.600 --> 07:08.309
OK, she's still adorable.
Time to go to DEFCON 1.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.271
Roll out the new Mark manifesto.

07:10.320 --> 07:14.279
Dobby, come in. There was actually
something I wanted to say.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.550
No pressure, but go out with me
or I'll hang myself.

07:16.600 --> 07:22.118
Hey. Er, my toothbrush isn't charging.
I think the voltages are wrong here.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.754
- Can l er...?
- Who the fuck are you?

07:24.800 --> 07:28.077
And what have you got against
240 lovely British volts?

07:28.120 --> 07:29.713
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:29.760 --> 07:32.036
- That's Gregory.
- Fuck this shit, it won't go in.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.878
And what does Gregory do?

07:33.920 --> 07:37.515
He's resting and writing
a great blog about digital rights

07:37.560 --> 07:39.790
and how Brooklyn
is changing for the worse,

07:39.840 --> 07:41.956
and comparing the different coffee shops
he doesn't like

07:42.000 --> 07:43.593
and how their coffee isn't real coffee.

07:43.640 --> 07:44.960
And the carrot cakes?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.116
Er, yeah, sometimes.

07:47.160 --> 07:49.959
- 1 knew it.
- OK. It's, er, charging.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.879
I'm gonna go back to the room.
I think I've got a headache.

07:52.920 --> 07:54.752
But I'm not sure.

07:54.800 --> 07:55.870
You coming, Dobby?

07:55.920 --> 07:59.800
Leave poor old million-text Mark
to his surveillance.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.751
- That's Jeremy.
- What's Jeremy doing in my bedroom?

08:01.800 --> 08:04.792
Mark, have you rigged your flat up
with spycams?

08:04.840 --> 08:07.832
Webcams. If Jeremy has nothing to hide,
he has nothing to fear.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.279
Who's that?

08:09.320 --> 08:12.836
Some guy.
He's taken some guy into my room.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.075
Oh, God.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.396
Is he gonna sell all my stuff, or...

08:16.440 --> 08:18.750
or download something horrible
onto my computer?

08:18.800 --> 08:20.757
Wow.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.997
- OK.
- Jeremy's gone gay. OK.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.316
Is he playing the field,
or is this guy his boyfriend?

08:26.360 --> 08:30.672
Don't know. He's always been
pretty slutty and-and a bit...

08:30.720 --> 08:32.677
but not actually the full...

08:32.720 --> 08:36.190
God, maybe he does this
every time I leave the house.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.595
Oh, God, what are they gonna do next?

08:38.640 --> 08:40.551
I think I know what they're gonna do next.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.193
Well, why can't they do it in his bed?

08:42.240 --> 08:45.756
- We should turn this off.
- Yeah, we definitely <i>should</i>.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.836
That reading light's gonna go.

08:50.880 --> 08:55.636
I wonder if they're gonna be into
penetration or just clip each other off.

08:55.680 --> 08:57.751
Yeah, that gives it a certain suspense.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.269
I really feel
I shouldn't be watching this.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.711
Are they...?

09:04.760 --> 09:06.353
Is my room all right?

09:06.400 --> 09:09.358
Your room's fine, but Jeremy's cock's
getting <i>quite</i> the hammering.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.710
Oi-oi, Marco, ready to go?

09:11.760 --> 09:16.038
Molly's gang are staying here, so Team
Hans are off to burn down the village.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.469
- DOBBY: Ooh.
- What you watching?

09:18.520 --> 09:20.079
Jez get fucked by some guy
on Mark's webcam.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.190
Right.

09:21.240 --> 09:22.719
Fair play.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.831
How long you been filming Jez
having sex, Mark?

09:24.880 --> 09:25.915
It's accidental.

09:25.960 --> 09:29.112
I just wanted to make sure
he hadn't turned up the central heating.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.878
You can relax on that front.

09:30.920 --> 09:33.355
I don't think they're gonna need
any central heating.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.754
I will not watch this.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.553
I'm gonna go and stare into the mirror
and wait out the fucking

09:37.600 --> 09:39.637
- like it's an air raid.
- DOBBY: Whoo!!

09:39.680 --> 09:41.557
- The reading light's gone, Mark.
- Ohh.

09:44.560 --> 09:47.552
- Anything else for the speech?
- Gregory, it's all cool.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.876
Mark is not going to jump me.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.831
He's not an alpha male asshole.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.474
Heh-heh!
Everyone trusts the pathetic worm.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.113
It's good to be a pathetic worm.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.312
Stop being a psycho and go back
to live-tweeting your headache.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.910
Oh, right,
I once fucking totalled a mate's car,

10:02.960 --> 10:04.280
smashed the shit out of it big-time,

10:04.320 --> 10:08.632
and we fell out and he came for me,
but I did him.

10:10.240 --> 10:12.311
Uh-huh. That's...

10:12.360 --> 10:13.953
That-That's a good story. Um...

10:14.000 --> 10:18.676
Any-Anything I could use
that might be a bit more romantic?

10:18.720 --> 10:23.396
Also, and I know this might sound
like a bit of a starter question, but...

10:23.440 --> 10:24.839
what's your name?

10:26.000 --> 10:29.391
Megan doesn't need to know about this.
Right?

10:29.440 --> 10:33.149
Oh, sure. Just watching TV with a guy.
It's like watching TV with Mark.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.636
Except, generally,
I don't have Mark's jizz on my leg.

10:36.680 --> 10:38.159
How would it be if...?

10:38.200 --> 10:43.195
I mean, I've had a really nice time
and, er, I don't want to push it, but...

10:43.240 --> 10:45.072
what if I stayed over?

10:45.120 --> 10:46.190
Er..

10:46.240 --> 10:49.676
Cuddling up all night with Joe,
as if we were boyfriend and... boyfriend?

10:49.720 --> 10:52.792
Am I gonna go the full three dimensions?

10:52.840 --> 10:56.470
Love to,
but I've gotta get on a coach... to Norfolk.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.431
- It's... Best friend's wedding.
- Now?

10:58.480 --> 11:00.118
Yeah, gotta go.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.630
Can't hang around here
cuddling all night long.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.911
Got to get on a night coach
to King's Lynn, my friend.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.469
I understand,
and I'm sorry for being rude.

11:10.520 --> 11:15.799
No, you've explained the economics
of running a rural taxi firm very clearly.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.354
Three hours for a cab.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.391
How are we gonna get back?
We're in the middle of nowhere.

11:21.440 --> 11:23.158
Fuck! Right...

11:23.200 --> 11:25.669
Oh, no, Hans. No, not that.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.633
Wicked! Hitching! Well, one of us
is definitely gonna get murdered.

11:28.680 --> 11:31.035
Probably bloody me. It's usually the girl.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.117
Relax. There are three of us.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.834
If they try anything,
just whip out a bootlace and...

11:35.880 --> 11:38.520
take 'em out from behind - nice and easy.

11:38.560 --> 11:43.873
Er... So, yeah, Dobs, I just wanted
to say, about the... million-text month...

11:43.920 --> 11:45.433
Sorry.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.915
I was just not feeling like chatting.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.156
After the weird picnic, I just felt...

11:50.200 --> 11:52.999
You know when you wanna get the fuck out,
because you're getting suffocated?

11:53.040 --> 11:55.509
Those last few months,
me and you, do you remember?

11:55.560 --> 11:58.518
We used to just sit on the sofa
watching DVD's

11:58.560 --> 12:00.517
and eating lamb pasanda
like a pair of zombies.

12:00.560 --> 12:04.190
Yeah. Was sort of like
a living death, wasn't it?

12:04.240 --> 12:05.355
It was lovely.

12:05.400 --> 12:09.394
Yeah, cos I've actually been thinking
of maybe training it to Budapest

12:09.440 --> 12:13.035
and getting into mime
and fucking street theatre.

12:13.080 --> 12:16.960
Yeah? You don't wanna hitch in England,
but you wanna mime in Hungary?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.115
Oh, God, no.

12:18.160 --> 12:21.790
Why would anyone be driving around
at this time? It doesn't make any sense.

12:21.840 --> 12:25.549
Dobby, we're not seriously
going to get into a <i>stranger's</i> car?

12:25.600 --> 12:27.477
It's an adventure, Mark.
They could be anyone.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.194
Poets, hippies, freaks, norms.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.516
Maniacs, people smugglers,
organ harvesters.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.710
Mm, everyone's drinking the Kool-Aid.

12:34.760 --> 12:37.115
I don't want any delicious Kool-Aid.

12:37.640 --> 12:38.994
- (TINNY MUSIC)
- The tinny vibration.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.873
God, that's annoying.
That has gotta hurt.

12:41.920 --> 12:45.276
I'm aggressively glancing.
Constant eye flicks and no smile.

12:45.320 --> 12:48.153
Man, he's gotta be hurting.
This is inhuman.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.395
I'm slaying him.

12:49.440 --> 12:52.273
What the hell am I doing
in this horrible coach

12:52.320 --> 12:54.596
instead of spooning with a lovely guy?

12:54.640 --> 12:57.234
Do I love Joe? Do I love Megan?

12:57.280 --> 12:59.635
Do I love this guy sitting next to me?

12:59.680 --> 13:02.115
Am I a guy who just slept with a guy,
which is fine,

13:02.160 --> 13:05.312
<i>or am I a guy who is a gay guy,
which is also fine,</i>

13:05.360 --> 13:08.318
or am I a guy who sometimes sleeps
with guys and sometimes doesn't?

13:08.360 --> 13:09.634
Which is also fine.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.273
It's all totally fine.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.519
So, why are you all out, then?
You guys looking for a good time, or what?

13:15.560 --> 13:18.279
<i>God, they're doggers.
I'm gonna get dogged.</i>

13:18.320 --> 13:21.756
Oh, we've just been out
for a few tomato juices, heading home.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.757
Do you know anywhere haunted?

13:23.800 --> 13:26.155
Properly haunted,
not just bullshit for tourists?

13:26.200 --> 13:28.111
What do you think?
Have we got time for a quick detour?

13:28.160 --> 13:30.549
We could go up to the old air-raid shelter
up on the top road, mebbee.

13:30.600 --> 13:34.480
Oh, my God.
! knew someone was gonna get murdered.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.033
- (WHISPERS) Hans!
- What?

13:36.080 --> 13:38.117
- Do not murder him.
- What did you say?

13:38.160 --> 13:40.276
- Er, nothing.
- Did you tell him to murder us?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.675
No, no, I-I-I said not to murder you.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.872
Just doing up my laces, guys.
Relax, for fuck's sake.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.399
Why are you talking about murdering us?

13:47.440 --> 13:49.317
No, no murdering.
It's-It's a misunderstanding.

13:49.360 --> 13:53.319
Cos if you come for us, I'll chop you up
and feed you into a fucking septic tank.

13:53.360 --> 13:57.035
Touché. We... We relent.
Seriously, no... no harm meant.

13:57.080 --> 14:00.755
- I momentarily thought that there was
an outside chance that my pal

14:00.800 --> 14:04.555
might be gonna try to murder you
and I was just checking that he wasn't,

14:04.600 --> 14:07.274
so... we're all good.

14:07.320 --> 14:12.110
So, what's, er... what's your position
on the whole Euro situation?

14:13.160 --> 14:16.357
Oh, my God. I thought Hans
was actually gonna garrotte him.

14:16.400 --> 14:17.196
I know.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.675
And then I thought no-one was gonna
challenge that guy on his xenophobic rant,

14:19.720 --> 14:21.711
but I just had to say it,
I couldn't let it go.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.512
I think it's good how you said it.

14:23.560 --> 14:26.359
I mean, I would have said it... eventually.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.432
Maybe a bit closer to our destination.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.115
How much further is it?

14:32.160 --> 14:33.958
Fuck knows. Like, three miles.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.038
Man, Molly's gonna shit a house brick.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.991
Right... I'm running.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.514
- No... shoes?
- No, man.

14:42.560 --> 14:45.598
Mother Nature's trainer, the human foot.

14:45.640 --> 14:46.960
Right, laters.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.320
Oh, and, er, watch out for wolves.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.237
There <i>are</i> no wolves in East Anglia, Hans.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.954
Yeah, you keep telling yourself that,
Marco.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.274
Ooh, you fucker!

14:54.320 --> 14:56.118
Oh, God. Five miles?

14:56.160 --> 14:59.073
If it gets too freezing,
we could always sleep in a barn.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.838
The prospect of spending the night

15:00.880 --> 15:03.190
huddled in a haystack with Dobby
should be thrilling.

15:03.240 --> 15:06.915
But all I can think about is my hotel bed
and my pillow chocolate.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.712
<i>I want my pillow chocolate.</i>

15:08.760 --> 15:11.479
Oh, no pillow chocolate.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.875
I don't expect them
to actually run me a bath.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.797
I simply want to eat some chocolate
off my pillow

15:15.840 --> 15:17.558
- like a normal human being.
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)

15:17.600 --> 15:19.079
Could it be Dobby?

15:19.120 --> 15:21.589
Maybe Gregory's minor headache
was an aneurysm.

15:21.640 --> 15:23.995
Heh-heh! Naughty but nice.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.633
Oh.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.353
- Hey.
- I thought you'd be here tomorrow.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.311
I am actually quite tired, so...

15:29.360 --> 15:32.557
- The inevitable Jez.
- How's the... Dobby mission... going?

15:32.600 --> 15:34.159
Disaster. She's got a boyfriend.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.955
She seems a lot happier,
comfier in her own skin.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.274
She's blossomed.

15:39.320 --> 15:40.993
I hate it when that happens.

15:41.040 --> 15:45.273
Yeah, so, um, I know we don't have
that many heart-to-heart chats,

15:45.320 --> 15:47.550
but, um, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

15:47.600 --> 15:50.956
Uh-huh.
! know nothing. Don't pre-empt.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.877
- Blank face, blank face.
- Look,

15:52.920 --> 15:56.515
you're the last person
who I would ideally talk to about this,

15:56.560 --> 15:59.473
but the fact is,
this will come as something of a shock.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.749
Total surprise.

16:00.800 --> 16:04.475
Earlier tonight,
I had sex with a man in my bedroom,

16:04.520 --> 16:06.989
-and...
- I'm... I'm sorry, in your bedroom?

16:07.040 --> 16:08.360
Yeah. And...

16:08.400 --> 16:13.395
I have feelings for this guy, Joe,
but I kind of walked out on him and...

16:13.440 --> 16:16.273
Just to clarify,
you were in... your bedroom?

16:16.320 --> 16:17.754
Yes, Mark.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.030
Anyway, um, as I was saying,
I really like this guy...

16:20.080 --> 16:24.790
Not the kitchen, or-or the living room,
or any other room in the flat?

16:24.840 --> 16:27.593
I'm talking about possibly the biggest
thing that's ever happened in my life

16:27.640 --> 16:30.553
and you're obsessing
about... roomal geography?

16:30.600 --> 16:32.830
No, fine. Go on. I-I-I'm sorry.

16:32.880 --> 16:36.077
I thought I was just totally open,
totally cool,

16:36.120 --> 16:38.475
but now I wonder if...

16:38.520 --> 16:43.549
inside, I don't have
some shame or confusion

16:43.600 --> 16:44.999
- deep in there.
- Uh-huh, I get it, mate.

16:45.040 --> 16:50.513
And-And what, out-out of interest,
was the temperature like in the room

16:50.560 --> 16:52.870
- when... when you were... doing it?
- Normal,

16:52.920 --> 16:55.070
unheated, regular air temperature.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.554
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

16:56.600 --> 16:58.989
Hey, Mark, Gregory forgot his toothbrush.
Oh, hey, Jez.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.873
- Hey, Dobs.
- Sorry, am I interrupting?

17:01.920 --> 17:04.230
I'll-I'll leave you two to... Sorry.

17:07.119 --> 17:08.315
Good luck!

17:08.359 --> 17:09.555
Dobby, are you all right?

17:09.599 --> 17:11.557
Sorry, it's just...

17:11.599 --> 17:14.069
I know something about you
which I shouldn't really know,

17:14.119 --> 17:15.598
but I do know, but it's not my fault.

17:15.640 --> 17:19.109
Anyway, really great, Jez,
everything, bye.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.594
Did you...?

17:20.640 --> 17:22.711
- Do you... know?
- Look,

17:22.760 --> 17:24.637
I'm sorry, Jez, but I've...

17:24.680 --> 17:26.990
I've got a webcam in my bedroom.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.714
Oh, my God! You watched me...?

17:29.760 --> 17:32.673
- I saw the whole thing and so did Dobby.
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)

17:32.720 --> 17:35.838
Hey, Mark, Dobs forgot the charger.
Can I grab it?

17:37.880 --> 17:40.440
Oh. Wow, you must be Jeremy.

17:40.480 --> 17:44.474
- Yes. How do you...?
- I, er... must have seen you before...

17:44.520 --> 17:46.636
around.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.159
See you later.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.679
Him as well?

17:49.720 --> 17:53.031
You chose to go into my bedroom.
You... You filmed yourself.

17:53.080 --> 17:55.993
I didn't know your room
was bristling with surveillance equipment.

17:56.040 --> 17:56.871
(DOOR OPENS)

17:56.920 --> 17:59.355
- All right, Jez?
- Hans.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.677
So, er, it's all cool with Molly.

18:02.720 --> 18:06.873
Look, I just wanted to say
about tonight, um... sorry...

18:06.920 --> 18:08.069
about the garrotting.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.760
I fucked up a nice lift home
for us there and, er,

18:10.800 --> 18:12.632
well, you didn't break my nuts about it.

18:12.680 --> 18:14.671
That's what real mates do. They, er...

18:14.720 --> 18:17.473
they take a pounding,
but they still come up smiling.

18:17.520 --> 18:20.160
Bit like Jez with that bloke in your bed.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.953
God, has the entire world
seen this fucking video?

18:23.000 --> 18:26.038
I came here to talk to someone about this,
get some perspective.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.594
Turns out I can just read
the fucking YouTube comments.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.950
Yeah. They might be good comments.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.477
Good afternoon.
My name's Katie Mitchell...

18:39.520 --> 18:41.716
JEREMY: First mistake -
no bouncers at the wedding. I'm in.

18:41.760 --> 18:43.398
Plus, the great thing is,

18:43.440 --> 18:47.320
I've escaped the strong, comforting
arms of the sexy, affectionate man.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.112
...to conduct this ceremony
for them today.

18:49.160 --> 18:50.833
So, it's my great pleasure...

18:50.880 --> 18:53.030
(WHISPERS) Gregory sure loves his phone.

18:53.080 --> 18:56.232
Looking at his phone and she loves it.
I could look at my phone.

18:56.280 --> 18:57.918
We all wanna look at our phones.

18:57.960 --> 19:00.110
They will now recite the vows
they have written together.

19:03.320 --> 19:06.233
I will not fail nor falter.

19:06.280 --> 19:10.274
I shall succeed. My perception is altered.

19:10.320 --> 19:11.754
I do believe.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.791
Faith is so strong now.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.638
Nothing shall bar my way.

19:15.680 --> 19:19.355
From conviction, no fiction.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.595
This is my day.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.639
I can move, move, move any mountain.

19:24.680 --> 19:27.320
I can move, move, move any mountain.

19:27.360 --> 19:31.194
BOTH: I can move, move, move
any mountain.

19:32.280 --> 19:33.953
- Simon...
- MARK: Simon?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.276
Super Simon? Simon Hans?

19:36.320 --> 19:38.470
...and into my heart.

19:38.520 --> 19:41.114
You are... the best of men.

19:41.160 --> 19:44.516
The truest, kindest, most generous of men.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.518
JEREMY: I think he might be
the opposite of all those words.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.471
I'm getting married.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.955
And I would punch in the throat
anyone who tried to stop me.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.038
That is how I feel today, Molly.

19:55.080 --> 19:59.233
So suffused with love,
I'd put a glass in the face of anyone

19:59.280 --> 20:01.715
who tried to stop us
joining our souls together.

20:02.920 --> 20:04.957
I'd hospitalise them.

20:10.280 --> 20:11.315
Hear, hear.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.431
The bride and groom.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.400
MARK: Mention the seven years
working in Richer Sounds in Kew,

20:19.440 --> 20:20.874
miss out the Thai jail,

20:20.920 --> 20:24.914
on to the bands, drop the first marriage,
hit Jeremy and their long friendship,

20:24.960 --> 20:28.715
minus all the bad blood and occasional
sucking each other off, blah, blah, blah.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.912
Wrap up with a toast to the bride
and groom, Hans, or-or possibly Simon,

20:31.960 --> 20:35.590
and his wife, whose Christian name
I've unfortunately forgotten.

20:35.640 --> 20:38.792
Shit!
I don't really know either of their names.

20:38.840 --> 20:42.674
There's Dobby. She doesn't like pasanda
and quality TV drama.

20:42.720 --> 20:46.190
She likes hitchhiking
and terrifying actual drama.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.992
We don't fit. Oh, my God!

20:48.040 --> 20:52.238
I'm letting go. I've crossed the bridge
into adulthood. I'm moving on.

20:52.280 --> 20:55.796
I'm gonna delete her off my GPS.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.478
Weird. It looks like
she's right behind me.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.670
Fuck! What the...?

20:59.720 --> 21:01.472
- Oof!
- I know you're stalking Dobby.

21:01.520 --> 21:04.353
I tracked your IP address.
You still love her.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.836
Gregory, believe me, I-I don't.
I-I'm not. I've stopped.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.678
- When?
- Literally just now.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.711
I-I was just about
to delete her off my phone.

21:11.760 --> 21:12.830
You douchebag!

21:12.880 --> 21:14.951
I promise you,
I-I don't like her any more.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.879
She-She's always saying
exactly what she's thinking,

21:17.920 --> 21:20.196
with-with no regards for the consequences

21:20.240 --> 21:23.631
and-and she's got weird hair,
and-and she smokes.

21:23.680 --> 21:26.593
Ah, please don't punch me.
I wish you both well.

21:26.640 --> 21:28.392
I wish you both Well!

21:30.840 --> 21:33.195
Um... Excuse me, ladies and gents.

21:33.240 --> 21:34.833
Excuse me. Oil

21:36.000 --> 21:40.437
Sorry, hi. Er, I'm afraid the, er,
the best man, er, has gone AWOL.

21:40.480 --> 21:45.554
Um, but don't worry. Just-Just eat
some cheese and I'll get it sorted.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.797
Jez, Jez.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.478
Um, would you...?

21:50.520 --> 21:52.079
- But I've got nothing prepared.
- That's all right.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.634
Just freestyle it, man, yeah?

21:54.680 --> 21:56.876
But don't, er... Obviously, don't rap.

21:56.920 --> 22:00.550
Remember? After Stoke? You never rap.

22:03.600 --> 22:06.433
(GLASS DINGS)

22:06.480 --> 22:08.153
Hans...

22:08.200 --> 22:10.191
Super... Hans...

22:10.240 --> 22:12.880
I've known Hans for many a year now.

22:12.920 --> 22:17.949
It's been a long road and now,
as you've found Molly,

22:18.000 --> 22:19.798
er, and...

22:19.840 --> 22:22.832
I don't really want to get into this,
but I've started it now,

22:22.880 --> 22:25.235
but I'm gonna bring it round,
so don't worry.

22:25.280 --> 22:30.593
People said Molly wasn't right for you.
That she was a downer.

22:30.640 --> 22:35.476
But you know what? If someone
loves someone, he just... loves them.

22:35.520 --> 22:40.594
And if that person
is considered to be a downer,

22:40.640 --> 22:44.315
or even a yawn-a-thon, who cares?

22:44.360 --> 22:49.070
And even if someone
loves another man... or...

22:49.120 --> 22:50.519
What's in a name?

22:50.560 --> 22:52.039
Or gender?

22:52.080 --> 22:55.710
Is it possible
to love two people at once? Three?

22:55.760 --> 22:58.513
Four is surely the limit.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.119
But is it?

23:00.160 --> 23:02.595
What is love anyway? Is it, er...

23:02.640 --> 23:05.234
an act or a feeling...

23:05.280 --> 23:07.556
or who am I to speak?

23:07.600 --> 23:08.874
Who are you to listen?

23:08.920 --> 23:11.992
Why is a marriage a marriage,

23:12.040 --> 23:16.955
but society says it's wrong
for two men to love one another

23:17.000 --> 23:18.559
even though...

23:18.600 --> 23:22.230
now it says it says that now it's OK?

23:22.280 --> 23:26.433
Is it OK because society says it's OK?
What next?

23:26.480 --> 23:30.997
Dogs getting married?
Could I marry my own son?

23:31.040 --> 23:32.599
No.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.392
Possibly not?

23:34.440 --> 23:36.158
Correct.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.919
Or is it? What I'm trying to say

23:38.960 --> 23:42.555
is that people should do
whatever they want to do

23:42.600 --> 23:46.912
at a temperature that suits them
within limits.

23:46.960 --> 23:47.950
Thank you.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.799
<i>Pretty sure someone's gonna print
that speech on a tea towel someday.</i>

23:50.840 --> 23:52.990
Yeah! Eat that, Obama.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.509
Fuck off, Mandela. Take that, Mark.

23:55.560 --> 23:58.757
I'm the best man.
I'm the best man who ever lived.
