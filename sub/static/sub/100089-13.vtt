WEBVTT

00:01.273 --> 00:02.601
Which one? I can't decide.

00:02.687 --> 00:04.335
Definitely... neither.

00:04.382 --> 00:07.185
Anyway, who cares? You and Tracy
are just going to a restaurant.

00:07.242 --> 00:09.211
Yeah, that serves breakfast for dinner.

00:09.244 --> 00:10.546
Dressing for breakfast, I get.

00:10.580 --> 00:11.981
Dressing for dinner? Double duh!

00:12.014 --> 00:13.815
But dressing for a place
that blends the two?

00:13.848 --> 00:15.285
<i>Impossiblé.</i>

00:15.317 --> 00:17.010
Look, you guys have been
dating for a year.

00:17.049 --> 00:18.557
If there's a sweater left
that she hasn't seen,

00:18.588 --> 00:19.889
you got too many sweaters, my man!

00:19.922 --> 00:22.292
We actually haven't gone out on
a date in, like, over a month.

00:22.325 --> 00:24.728
Between the holidays
and Sophie joining bell choir,

00:24.783 --> 00:26.296
we just haven't had
that much time together.

00:26.329 --> 00:28.364
Well, does bell choir need
to meet five days a week?

00:28.396 --> 00:30.399
I don't know. Do they <i>
want</i> to make regionals?

00:30.433 --> 00:32.302
Okay. Let's go to your closet.

00:32.334 --> 00:33.569
<i>I'll</i> pick something.

00:33.602 --> 00:35.837
Don't make eye contact with
Rory, or he'll try to join us.

00:38.840 --> 00:41.009
Will and Tracy are going to Night Yolk?

00:41.042 --> 00:42.477
<i>That's</i> a hot rezzie.

00:42.511 --> 00:45.148
Just thinking about it gives
zaddy a hankering for pancakes.

00:45.181 --> 00:47.217
Listen to me, dinner tonight
is gonna be bad.

00:47.249 --> 00:48.317
No, you listen to <i> me.</i>

00:48.351 --> 00:49.852
I am the taste maker
of this friend group,

00:49.885 --> 00:51.154
and I won't remind you again.

00:51.187 --> 00:52.187
It's not that.

00:52.221 --> 00:54.424
My dad's not
just having dinner with Tracy.

00:54.456 --> 00:56.825
Tonight, he's gonna get dumped.

00:56.858 --> 00:58.093
I was with him at KZOP,

00:58.126 --> 00:59.895
trying to kill time
before his segment...

00:59.928 --> 01:01.697
You're a bad bitch forecast freak!

01:01.730 --> 01:03.399
You're a bad bitch forecast freak.

01:03.432 --> 01:05.400
<i>I was going to see
if the satellite truck guys</i>

01:05.434 --> 01:06.569
<i>were rolling dice.</i>

01:06.601 --> 01:08.537
<i>That's when it happened.</i>

01:08.571 --> 01:10.840
I'm tired of trying to make it work.

01:10.872 --> 01:12.874
I feel terrible all the time.

01:12.908 --> 01:14.876
Will and I are going to dinner tonight.

01:14.910 --> 01:16.712
I'm gonna end it there.

01:16.745 --> 01:18.580
Well, would you look at that.

01:18.613 --> 01:19.715
Sisters!

01:22.818 --> 01:24.721
I feel like I know the stool
he's referring to.

01:24.753 --> 01:25.754
Rory!

01:25.788 --> 01:27.299
A breakup will <i> kill</i> my dad.

01:27.324 --> 01:28.323
Or at the very least,

01:28.348 --> 01:30.784
send him into
another long phase of sad baths.

01:30.809 --> 01:32.761
What makes you think
your dad's gonna overreact?

01:32.795 --> 01:35.431
A caramel shirt, Poppy?! Really?

01:35.464 --> 01:37.867
What's next? You want me
to put on nougat pants?!

01:38.967 --> 01:40.369
You guys want juice?

01:40.402 --> 01:43.372

01:45.598 --> 01:47.075
I can't believe it's happening.

01:47.108 --> 01:50.413
Sicily's own Graham D'Amato
is finally meeting Papà Derek.

01:50.446 --> 01:51.947
Hold still. Tony's got pins,

01:51.980 --> 01:53.548
and he won't hear you if you scream.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.651
I hope my new look
doesn't get messed up.

01:55.685 --> 01:57.620
You know, when we're doing guy stuff,

01:57.652 --> 01:58.987
like watching the big game

01:59.021 --> 02:01.090
and eating queso with our shirts off.

02:01.122 --> 02:02.090
Big day.

02:02.123 --> 02:03.426
Big day!

02:03.458 --> 02:06.428
I am <i> not</i> on antianxiety meds,
and I am pumped!

02:06.461 --> 02:07.429
Big day.

02:07.462 --> 02:08.631
How do I look?

02:08.663 --> 02:09.764
Dynamite.

02:09.799 --> 02:11.934
Like a rich kid
going to court for murder.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.101
How do you feel?

02:13.134 --> 02:14.436
Excited.

02:14.470 --> 02:17.273
But also cold and sweaty and weird.

02:17.305 --> 02:19.099
Okay, Mom, when Derek gets here,

02:19.124 --> 02:21.577
I want to be in my room
doing a 3-D puzz.

02:21.609 --> 02:24.613
So if he asks,
I 3-D puzz all the time, 'kay?

02:24.646 --> 02:27.150
'Kay, buddy. It's <i> your</i> backstory.

02:30.671 --> 02:32.288
- Okay, so, here's the plan.
- Oh, no, thank you.

02:32.321 --> 02:33.589
Last month, I promised Graham

02:33.621 --> 02:36.491
that he could meet his dad,
and today is the day.

02:36.525 --> 02:38.161
But that kid is easily overwhelmed,

02:38.193 --> 02:40.829
so I have designed this weekend
to run like a corporate retreat.

02:40.863 --> 02:42.431
We'll exchange names, a few fun facts,

02:42.465 --> 02:44.500
and then we all go home with a tote bag

02:44.532 --> 02:47.669
and an opinion of Houston
that remains 100% unchanged.

02:47.703 --> 02:49.938
Living together has brought us
closer this year.

02:49.972 --> 02:51.107
I regret that.

02:51.139 --> 02:52.441
See, I have broken down this weekend

02:52.474 --> 02:54.977
into digestible 90-minute chunks, okay?

02:55.009 --> 02:58.263
I call them "chunkies," because
a chunky is just long enough

02:58.288 --> 02:59.622
for Graham to get a sense of Derek

02:59.648 --> 03:01.783
but not so long that he gets attached.

03:01.817 --> 03:03.286
Okay, well, I have a date

03:03.318 --> 03:06.655
with Sky TV's all-day marathon
of Brexit news,

03:06.688 --> 03:09.559
so enjoy this oddball family reunion.

03:09.591 --> 03:11.493
No, no, no, no.
This is not a family reunion.

03:11.526 --> 03:13.195
Okay, this is a structured event

03:13.219 --> 03:14.373
that will repeat yearly

03:14.398 --> 03:16.732
until Graham is in college
or Derek kicks it.

03:16.765 --> 03:18.400
That's boundaries, baby.

03:18.434 --> 03:20.502
And to set 'em,
Derek is not allowed to go

03:20.536 --> 03:22.805
anywhere near my bed or my bod.

03:22.837 --> 03:24.607
Easy, Tony.

03:27.042 --> 03:28.144
Hi. I'm Der...

03:28.176 --> 03:29.446
Don't care.

03:32.180 --> 03:36.118
Sorry I'm late. I lost track of
time finishing a 40-piece puzz.

03:37.553 --> 03:39.422
Were either of those guys Graham?

03:41.757 --> 03:43.926
I have to find a way to cancel dinner.

03:43.959 --> 03:45.428
I'd have you pretend to be sick,

03:45.460 --> 03:46.928
but you don't have the acting chops.

03:46.961 --> 03:48.263
I've heard your fake cough.

03:48.297 --> 03:49.565
What?! I can fake-cough.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.565
Cough!

03:50.598 --> 03:52.067
- Oh, sweetie.
- Whatever.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.902
I have a move that always works.

03:53.936 --> 03:56.038
Prepare to be dazzled.

03:56.071 --> 03:57.273
Okay, Tracy's on her way,

03:57.305 --> 03:59.174
so if there are any
outfit notes, it's too late.

03:59.208 --> 04:01.443
Dad... you can't go.

04:01.477 --> 04:03.746
Because I've been struck by...

04:03.779 --> 04:05.214
vertigo.

04:05.246 --> 04:06.748
What? Soph!

04:06.781 --> 04:08.917
As Will rushes to his daughter's side,

04:08.950 --> 04:11.086
Rory reacts, impressed.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.578
Perhaps he misjudged her after all.

04:15.790 --> 04:18.427
Okay, did you girls get
the TV up and running yet?

04:18.459 --> 04:20.728
It's a big day for Brexit coverage.

04:20.762 --> 04:23.765
I just love seeing
that stupid country fall apart.

04:25.301 --> 04:27.303
There's no easy way to say this.

04:27.335 --> 04:28.470
The TV's dead.

04:28.503 --> 04:30.773
But... you said you could fix it.

04:30.806 --> 04:33.743
We did everything we could,
but it was just her time.

04:33.775 --> 04:35.444
Poor thing.

04:35.482 --> 04:36.607
She was never the same after

04:36.632 --> 04:38.076
Time Warner became Spectrum.

04:38.123 --> 04:40.917
Hey, guys, check this out...
Dwayne's in a car commercial!

04:40.950 --> 04:42.418
Don't bother. She's gone.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.886
Leave the corpse alone.

04:43.919 --> 04:47.556
Which reminds me, take your time
when making arrangements.

04:47.590 --> 04:50.258
Yeah. Trash pickup's not until Tuesday.

04:50.292 --> 04:51.761
<i>Come on down to Dwayne's,</i>

04:51.794 --> 04:53.796
<i>where you'll find
the car of your dweams.</i>

04:53.828 --> 04:54.930
You did it!

04:54.963 --> 04:55.997
Miggy!

04:56.030 --> 04:57.232
What'd I do?

04:57.265 --> 04:58.568
You fixed the TV.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.302
Even the twins couldn't do it.

05:00.335 --> 05:01.403
But you <i> did.</i>

05:01.436 --> 05:04.105
Um, Amy?

05:04.138 --> 05:06.641
What the living crap?

05:06.674 --> 05:09.177
Don't talk to me. I'm processing.

05:09.210 --> 05:11.146
- Hold my hand, Father.
- Oh.

05:11.179 --> 05:13.081
I feel bad for Sophie,

05:13.114 --> 05:14.417
but am I the only one
who can't stop thinking

05:14.450 --> 05:15.685
about breakfast for dinner?

05:15.717 --> 05:17.814
Girl, you basically look like
a waffle to me right now.

05:20.955 --> 05:21.924
You get it.

05:21.957 --> 05:25.028
I'll be here with these dancing spots.

05:27.696 --> 05:29.664
Hey, is this really
what vertigo looks like?

05:29.698 --> 05:32.001
Who knows? It's the vaguest
sickness of all time.

05:32.034 --> 05:33.536
Why do you think I picked it?

05:33.568 --> 05:34.486
You're evil.

05:34.511 --> 05:35.445
Marry me.

05:35.470 --> 05:36.304
- Hey.
- Hey!

05:36.337 --> 05:37.622
Team Bagels-After-Dark.

05:37.647 --> 05:38.941
Ready to hit the road to carb town?

05:40.342 --> 05:41.611
Is everything okay?

05:41.643 --> 05:43.979
I am so sorry, but we're gonna
have to play dinner by ear.

05:44.013 --> 05:45.047
Sophie has vertigo.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.349
It's a thing where you get dizzy.

05:47.383 --> 05:49.852
Oh, I've had vertigo my whole life.

05:49.885 --> 05:51.621
I had to wear a helmet to my prom,

05:51.653 --> 05:53.021
and I was <i> still</i> voted queen.

05:53.054 --> 05:54.956
Imagine how good my boobs had to be.

05:54.989 --> 05:56.893
Sorry. Forgot my audience.

05:56.926 --> 05:59.228
Point is, I am a vertigo expert.

06:01.196 --> 06:02.898
Enter Tracy Freeze.

06:02.931 --> 06:07.369
Cheap shoes, decent purse,
and a hell of a plot twist.

06:07.402 --> 06:08.571
Focus, all right?

06:08.604 --> 06:09.871
I am the captain of this ship.

06:09.905 --> 06:12.008
And before you meet the only
important passenger on board,

06:12.040 --> 06:13.542
I need to know you understand the rules.

06:13.575 --> 06:14.977
- Aye aye, captain.
- No!

06:15.010 --> 06:16.212
The ship stuff is only for me.

06:16.244 --> 06:17.979
Rule one... you can only ask Graham

06:18.013 --> 06:19.882
the pre-approved questions I e-mailed.

06:19.914 --> 06:21.551
Ho'd up. What's in the bag?

06:21.583 --> 06:24.185
Gifts. Turns out it's hard
to shop for a kid I don't know.

06:24.219 --> 06:26.022
"He's a boy with brown hair"
was not enough information

06:26.054 --> 06:27.122
for the guy at Target.

06:30.292 --> 06:31.761
- Bouncy ball?
- Mm-hmm.

06:31.794 --> 06:33.061
- Slingshot.
- Mm-hmm.

06:33.095 --> 06:34.263
And what is this, shorts?

06:34.296 --> 06:35.898
Did you bring my son a pair of shorts?

06:35.931 --> 06:37.066
Are shorts no good?

06:37.099 --> 06:38.734
That's okay. I've prepared for that.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.335
I also have capris in my van.

06:40.369 --> 06:43.506
How about we push gifts
till Chunky Number Two?

06:43.539 --> 06:45.041
Hey, hey, before we go in there,

06:45.073 --> 06:47.309
I just want to say thank you for this.

06:48.410 --> 06:49.979
I'm gonna meet my son.

06:51.780 --> 06:52.982
No bod!

06:54.616 --> 06:56.251
It's showtime.

06:56.285 --> 06:58.054
♪ See if it fits ♪

06:58.087 --> 06:59.755

06:59.787 --> 07:03.626

07:07.462 --> 07:09.631
Hi, Graham.

07:12.333 --> 07:15.971
O-Okay, Graham,
you wanna kick things off?

07:17.840 --> 07:18.974
You okay, man?

07:19.008 --> 07:21.243
Uh, what if <i> I</i> go first?

07:21.275 --> 07:22.569
What's your favorite color?

07:24.446 --> 07:26.163
Oh!

07:27.116 --> 07:29.452
Yeah, there's a lot of junk food
in there. Don't judge me.

07:32.976 --> 07:34.512
Are you sure this is vertigo?

07:34.544 --> 07:36.446
Yeah, mine's just really bad.

07:36.479 --> 07:38.349
Maybe <i> you</i> don't have vertigo.

07:38.382 --> 07:40.651
Oh, God, the floor is the ceiling.

07:40.683 --> 07:42.118
Tracy, if the floor was the wall,

07:42.152 --> 07:43.120
I'd feel much more confident,

07:43.152 --> 07:45.022
but I'm sorry, we have to raincheck.

07:45.055 --> 07:47.757
Okay, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

07:47.791 --> 07:49.959
No,<i> you're</i> thinking what <i> I'm</i> thinking.

07:49.993 --> 07:52.296
We're taking that rezzie
and getting stupid on eggs.

07:52.329 --> 07:54.965
- Will, we can totally stay.
- I mean, you know, nothing we can do.

07:54.998 --> 07:56.767
- We're here for you.
- Okay, you have my cell.

07:56.799 --> 07:58.768
- Okay, byeeee!
- Okay, byeeee!

08:00.536 --> 08:03.207
Papa? I could use a blanket.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.275
Classic or electric?

08:04.308 --> 08:06.409
You know, never mind, I'm bringing both.

08:09.079 --> 08:11.382
How you feeling?

08:11.414 --> 08:14.117
Spinning like a dreidel. Oy vey!

08:14.151 --> 08:15.553
I know the feeling.

08:15.585 --> 08:17.287
How's the light sensitivity?

08:17.320 --> 08:20.857
Brutal. It's like my sunglasses
need sunglasses, ya feel?

08:21.825 --> 08:23.294
You know what I hate?

08:23.327 --> 08:24.495
The stuffy noses.

08:24.527 --> 08:27.164
Yeah. What up, my mouth-breathers?

08:28.164 --> 08:30.333
Stuffy noses isn't a vertigo thing.

08:31.401 --> 08:32.469
I know.

08:32.501 --> 08:34.471
I... have a cold, too.

08:34.503 --> 08:35.873
Cough!

08:37.373 --> 08:38.508
I'm trying to determine

08:38.541 --> 08:40.643
if that was a nervous barf
or a sick barf.

08:40.676 --> 08:42.580
Oh, I know all about barf types
'cause of the band.

08:42.613 --> 08:44.415
I can tell from here he's not drunk.

08:44.448 --> 08:45.516
That's good.

08:45.549 --> 08:47.251
Y-You know what?
I do not need your help.

08:47.283 --> 08:48.885
Just... go to your van

08:48.918 --> 08:51.254
until I can figure out
how to rework my game plan.

08:51.287 --> 08:52.889
Okay. I guess knock if you need me.

08:52.922 --> 08:55.392
I'm the orange one out front with
the sticker of the shy crow.

09:02.898 --> 09:04.400
Where's Derek?

09:04.434 --> 09:06.670
Did I ruin it? Did he leave?

09:06.703 --> 09:09.673
He's outside. But, honey, you're sick.

09:09.705 --> 09:11.841
Maybe we should tell him
to come back another time.

09:11.874 --> 09:14.110
No! I sold the puzz thing,

09:14.143 --> 09:15.945
and now I'm riding a post-barf high.

09:15.979 --> 09:19.182
I've got a nine-minute window
before I go down again.

09:19.215 --> 09:21.084
Please, Mom?

09:25.955 --> 09:27.390
Hey. How's Graham?

09:27.424 --> 09:29.260
Oh. Sorry. It's a guy thing.

09:29.292 --> 09:30.293
Queso?

09:30.326 --> 09:32.429
Pass. What is happening in here?

09:32.461 --> 09:33.896
Oh, these are all gifts for Graham.

09:33.930 --> 09:35.299
I don't know what kind of kid he is.

09:35.331 --> 09:38.546
Spooky? Party dude? Pyromaniac?

09:38.571 --> 09:39.736
I got a gift for every kind of kid.

09:39.770 --> 09:41.739
- Is that a turtle?
- She's mine.

09:41.772 --> 09:45.408
But if Graham wants Phoebe,
I'm sure she'll adjust.

09:45.441 --> 09:47.043
Okay, you know what?
We don't have time for this.

09:47.076 --> 09:49.612
We only have seven minutes
until the barf train hits again,

09:49.646 --> 09:50.981
so put on your shirt and come inside.

09:51.013 --> 09:52.782
Wait, no! Keep it off.

09:52.815 --> 09:53.816
No! Put it on!

09:53.849 --> 09:56.152
And hustle, you sicko.

09:58.488 --> 10:01.291
Look at us. We're still the best
in the damn business.

10:01.325 --> 10:04.427
So what if Miggy fixed the stupid TV?

10:04.460 --> 10:06.964
Yeah, even a broken clock's
right twice a day.

10:06.997 --> 10:09.433
Let's see him try
to power sand mahogany.

10:09.465 --> 10:12.268
Hey, scary look-alikes,
can I borrow your screwdriver?

10:12.301 --> 10:13.604
The one with the crisscrossy?

10:13.637 --> 10:15.705
Your dad asked me to fix the toaster.

10:17.940 --> 10:19.108
Douglas!

10:19.142 --> 10:21.445
What gives? You replacing us?

10:21.478 --> 10:23.447
We gave you our best work years.

10:23.479 --> 10:26.282
I guess that counts for
jack potatoes around here.

10:26.315 --> 10:28.584
So I let Miggy take a crack
at the toaster.

10:28.618 --> 10:29.753
He's on a hot streak.

10:29.786 --> 10:30.854
I'm on a hot streak!

10:30.887 --> 10:32.823
I'll tell you what...
why don't we all sit down

10:32.855 --> 10:34.957
and watch Europe fall apart as a family?

10:34.990 --> 10:37.427
Pass. We got bigger problems to face.

10:37.460 --> 10:41.764
This chapter of our lives
as useful citizens is over.

10:44.901 --> 10:46.303
Will.

10:46.335 --> 10:47.604
After you're finished chopping rosemary

10:47.637 --> 10:49.540
to help bring out the Hot Pocket,

10:49.573 --> 10:51.775
can we maybe sit and talk?

10:51.807 --> 10:53.810
I'm sorry. I can't. Sophie needs me.

10:53.844 --> 10:55.145
Does she?

10:56.512 --> 10:59.816
Is it possible
that she might be... faking?

10:59.849 --> 11:03.354
Whoa. Did you just accuse
my daughter of lying?

11:03.387 --> 11:06.056
It's just, I spent 10 summers
at Grimace House,

11:06.089 --> 11:07.782
a safe space for kids with vertigo.

11:07.837 --> 11:11.297
I know vertigo, and she doesn't have it.

11:11.395 --> 11:14.899
Ha-cha-cha, that's a brazen accusation.

11:14.969 --> 11:17.200
All I'm saying is that Sophie is...

11:17.233 --> 11:19.335
Sick, Tracy, with vertigo.

11:19.368 --> 11:21.372
And I know that that ruins our date,

11:21.405 --> 11:22.539
but you just have to accept the fact

11:22.571 --> 11:24.207
that tonight can't be about you.

11:24.240 --> 11:27.510
Oh, uh, believe me,

11:27.543 --> 11:28.778
I'm getting that.

11:29.746 --> 11:31.415
You know, I'm gonna go to Night Yolk.

11:31.448 --> 11:33.250
I'm gonna change into comfy pants

11:33.282 --> 11:35.719
and freak people out
with how much I solo-order.

11:39.589 --> 11:42.358
Dad! My body's giving out on me!

11:42.392 --> 11:45.095
While you're in the kitchen,
can I have an eclair...

11:46.897 --> 11:48.565
I made you a Hot Pocket.

11:48.598 --> 11:50.767
Before you destroy me, just remember,

11:50.801 --> 11:52.869
I'm a child of divorce.

11:52.902 --> 11:54.337
Thanks for staying.

11:54.371 --> 11:57.374
There are just a few things
I've always wondered about you,

11:57.407 --> 11:58.541
like...

11:58.575 --> 12:00.944
do you prefer Chili's or Chili's Too?

12:00.977 --> 12:02.746
Chili's Too.

12:02.778 --> 12:04.714
They're airport-only, so you never know

12:04.748 --> 12:06.517
where they're getting their fish.

12:06.550 --> 12:07.851
What a rush.

12:07.883 --> 12:09.753
Great. Next question?

12:09.786 --> 12:12.556
Have we seen the last of Ricky Martin?

12:12.589 --> 12:14.925
He'll be back when we least expect it.

12:16.426 --> 12:18.295
Uh-oh. How you feeling?

12:18.328 --> 12:19.430
Okay.

12:19.463 --> 12:21.765
Have you ever barfed before?

12:21.797 --> 12:23.267
Oh, that's not on the list.

12:23.300 --> 12:25.135
Fine. Go for it.

12:25.167 --> 12:27.437
But be brief.

12:27.470 --> 12:29.907
Yes. I've barfed many times.

12:29.940 --> 12:31.074
Cool.

12:31.107 --> 12:33.444
When it happens,
do you cry a little, too?

12:33.477 --> 12:34.911
Every time.

12:37.580 --> 12:38.614
Time's up.

12:38.647 --> 12:40.750
It's coming for me.

12:40.783 --> 12:41.784
I'll help.

12:41.817 --> 12:43.252
Nope. We don't need your help.

12:43.286 --> 12:44.755
Graham, Mommy will meet you there.

12:44.787 --> 12:46.322
At least let me get him some water.

12:46.355 --> 12:47.990
No need. I am in control.

12:48.023 --> 12:49.993
I am going to tuck my son in
independently,

12:50.026 --> 12:52.662
just like I have done
for every flu since he was born.

12:52.695 --> 12:53.931
'Cause, as you can see,

12:53.964 --> 12:56.032
you being here for this
really isn't necessary.

12:57.099 --> 12:59.670
It's <i> never</i> been necessary,
for that matter.

12:59.703 --> 13:01.505
'Cause I can, and will,
take care of things

13:01.537 --> 13:02.972
all by myself.

13:05.341 --> 13:06.943
See?

13:06.977 --> 13:08.278
I didn't need you at all.

13:08.310 --> 13:09.412
Yeah.

13:12.282 --> 13:14.651
Well, I should probably
get back to my van.

13:14.684 --> 13:16.854
Phoebe will be hungry for her flies.

13:18.153 --> 13:19.522
Unless you have some loose kale.

13:19.556 --> 13:21.624
You know what? I'm good.

13:22.057 --> 13:23.159
Also...

13:23.192 --> 13:26.029
that kid is amazing.

13:26.704 --> 13:27.804
Wait.

13:29.000 --> 13:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:38.230 --> 13:39.515
So, vertigo's always been a lie?

13:39.559 --> 13:41.605
Like when you got it
before Gam Gam's funeral

13:41.691 --> 13:43.584
or when I wanted
to take you moped shopping?

13:43.637 --> 13:45.113
- God, now <i> I'm</i> dizzy.
- Sorry.

13:45.178 --> 13:47.309
I only use it for emergencies.

13:47.342 --> 13:48.810
Yeah, what was the emergency tonight?

13:48.843 --> 13:50.246
Tracy was gonna dump you.

13:51.478 --> 13:53.147
What?

13:53.180 --> 13:54.516
How do you even know that?

13:54.549 --> 13:56.318
I overheard her at KZOP.

13:57.518 --> 13:58.519
Oh, God.

14:02.324 --> 14:03.824
Wow.

14:03.858 --> 14:05.861
The only thing worse than
being dumped by your girlfriend

14:05.893 --> 14:07.695
is hearing you're dumped
by your 9-year-old.

14:07.728 --> 14:09.730
Dad, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know what to do.

14:09.763 --> 14:11.832
No, it's sweet that you were
trying to protect me,

14:11.866 --> 14:14.803
but if Tracy wants to break up with me,

14:14.835 --> 14:16.170
I can't avoid it.

14:16.204 --> 14:17.839
Am I still in trouble?

14:17.872 --> 14:19.241
Oh, definitely.

14:19.273 --> 14:21.809
Lying is always wrong,

14:21.843 --> 14:23.812
even if your heart
was in the right place.

14:23.844 --> 14:26.013
Like when you killed that parrot.

14:26.046 --> 14:29.185
Cool. The dreams had just stopped.

14:32.219 --> 14:35.089
Oh! Don't even think about carrying
me to my bedroom, you perv.

14:35.122 --> 14:36.657
Fine. I'll just lightly push you.

14:36.690 --> 14:37.692
No, no! No.

14:37.725 --> 14:39.927
I think it's time for you to go, okay?

14:39.960 --> 14:42.163
I-I'm clearly too sick
to protect Graham.

14:42.196 --> 14:43.431
Protect Graham?

14:43.464 --> 14:46.067
Is this really about Graham,
or is this about <i> you?</i>

14:46.100 --> 14:48.402
'Cause it feels like if it was
about Graham, you'd let me help.

14:48.435 --> 14:50.939
All right, maybe it <i> is</i> about me, okay?

14:50.972 --> 14:53.742
Maybe I'm mad
because I could've had help

14:53.775 --> 14:56.111
for eight years worth of stomach flus,

14:56.143 --> 14:58.012
but I didn't because you abandoned us.

14:58.045 --> 14:59.448
Look, Angie...

14:59.481 --> 15:01.750
No talkie! Just listen-y!

15:02.816 --> 15:05.419
I have made it through
mother/son sick days

15:05.453 --> 15:07.456
his whole life,
and I'm gonna do it again today.

15:07.488 --> 15:10.790
Now, excuse me. I have to
go get my son some water.

15:28.175 --> 15:30.211
You like this, don't you?

15:30.244 --> 15:32.040
You nasty.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.080
Mm.

15:33.113 --> 15:35.416
Well, it's official.

15:35.449 --> 15:36.584
We're useless.

15:36.617 --> 15:39.754
We're pay phones, Amy. We're pay phones.

15:39.787 --> 15:42.556
Okay, enough bellyaching.
So you couldn't fix the TV.

15:42.589 --> 15:44.593
Look at all the things
you've done around here.

15:44.626 --> 15:46.762
You put the sauna in,
for crying out loud.

15:46.795 --> 15:48.930
Any schnook with hands
could've done that.

15:48.963 --> 15:51.565
Yeah, we don't need your pity.
Now screw.

15:51.598 --> 15:53.435
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Whoa-kay.

15:53.468 --> 15:55.771
I can't let this go on any longer.

15:55.804 --> 15:58.607
I didn't fix anything. Not technically.

15:58.640 --> 15:59.841
Oh, ho'd up.

15:59.873 --> 16:01.909
Oh, God, now <i> I'm</i> saying
that kind of thing.

16:01.943 --> 16:05.012
I got to start hanging around
people my own age. Carry on.

16:05.045 --> 16:07.348
I just blew in the ports
and thought happy thoughts.

16:07.382 --> 16:09.584
Same thing I do when
my Nintendo's not working.

16:09.617 --> 16:11.086
I knew it was an accident!

16:11.118 --> 16:12.286
I should've said something,

16:12.319 --> 16:15.022
but it was nice to feel smart
just for once.

16:15.055 --> 16:16.590
But here's the great thing, Miggy...

16:16.623 --> 16:18.627
you're <i> not,</i> and we <i> are.</i>

16:18.660 --> 16:20.594
Order's been restored.

16:20.627 --> 16:22.330
Ouch.

16:23.864 --> 16:25.966
This is bad.

16:25.999 --> 16:28.002
We should be there for Will,
not taking his meal.

16:28.036 --> 16:29.670
They make a crab meat beignet.

16:29.704 --> 16:30.771
Oh, we're definitely getting those.

16:30.805 --> 16:32.207
Poppy? Rory?

16:32.239 --> 16:34.275
Did you take my table?

16:34.309 --> 16:37.512
I booked it two months ago
after my lizard passed.

16:37.545 --> 16:39.180
Uh, no, Tracy.

16:39.214 --> 16:41.382
And to be honest,
I'm a little offended, okay?

16:41.415 --> 16:43.319
And also, the reservation's
under <i> Will's</i> name, so...

16:44.853 --> 16:46.121
Oh, wow.

16:46.154 --> 16:48.357
Look who's standing upright
without any problems.

16:48.390 --> 16:51.360
Uh... Rory, why don't we
give Tracy the table?

16:51.392 --> 16:53.362
Also, it's time for us
to get our souvenir T-shirts.

16:53.395 --> 16:55.030
Okay.

16:58.433 --> 16:59.501
I am sorry.

16:59.534 --> 17:01.737
She <i> was</i> faking it.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.305
And not that it makes it better,

17:03.337 --> 17:06.307
but the only reason
she was doing that is...

17:06.340 --> 17:09.077
because she said you were
planning on breaking up with me.

17:09.109 --> 17:11.680
Now, before you say anything,

17:11.712 --> 17:13.848
I just want to say I know
that I haven't been present,

17:13.882 --> 17:15.217
but that is all gonna change, okay?

17:15.249 --> 17:17.218
Next week, I am all yours.

17:17.251 --> 17:18.252
Well, no, scratch that.

17:18.286 --> 17:19.720
Sophie starts two-a-days at bell choir,

17:19.753 --> 17:21.223
but after that, it lightens up.

17:21.256 --> 17:22.757
Unless they go to state, in which case

17:22.790 --> 17:24.492
I'm just gonna rent a place
in Sacramento,

17:24.526 --> 17:26.594
because if we win, we get
to perform for Gavin Newsom.

17:26.627 --> 17:30.031
Will, I wasn't gonna break up with you.

17:30.064 --> 17:31.233
You weren't?

17:31.266 --> 17:32.401
Mnh-mnh.

17:32.433 --> 17:34.735
But what about
what Sophie overheard at KZOP?

17:34.768 --> 17:36.872
I am tired of trying to make it work.

17:36.904 --> 17:38.873
I feel terrible all the time.

17:38.907 --> 17:41.776
Will and I are going to dinner tonight.

17:41.809 --> 17:43.210
I'm gonna end it there.

17:43.244 --> 17:44.246
Well, would you look at that.

17:44.278 --> 17:45.846
No more dieting for Tracy Freeze.

17:45.880 --> 17:46.848
Sisters!

17:46.881 --> 17:48.516
- You were ending a diet?
- Mm-hmm.

17:48.549 --> 17:51.085
Which is why you were so anxious
to get to dinner tonight.

17:51.119 --> 17:52.920
Which also explains
why I was so easily frustrated

17:52.953 --> 17:54.755
by a 9-year-old, which I am sorry about.

17:55.795 --> 17:58.526
I am so glad you're not planning
to break up with me.

17:58.559 --> 18:00.861
Um...

18:00.894 --> 18:03.297
I wasn't planning on it, but, um...

18:03.331 --> 18:06.901
after tonight,
I'm just wondering if maybe...

18:06.934 --> 18:09.870
time apart isn't the worst idea.

18:09.903 --> 18:12.406
Let's not just end this
because of one night

18:12.440 --> 18:14.141
of my child experimenting with acting.

18:14.174 --> 18:16.243
I mean, she <i> was</i> pretty good, after all.

18:16.276 --> 18:18.113
It's not just tonight, Will.

18:18.145 --> 18:19.413
It's <i> always</i> something.

18:19.447 --> 18:21.283
I know. I'm working on that, right?

18:21.308 --> 18:23.179
I mean, I'm not hanging out
with Angie anymore,

18:23.204 --> 18:25.482
and I guess I could get
more babysitters for Sophie,

18:25.507 --> 18:27.288
maybe do, like, a grid swap
with Miggy, and then I...

18:27.322 --> 18:29.157
I don't want you to have to wedge me in.

18:29.190 --> 18:30.926
I know that I cannot be

18:30.959 --> 18:32.427
the number one person in your life,

18:32.459 --> 18:35.229
but I want to be the number one person

18:35.263 --> 18:37.190
in <i> someone's</i> life.

18:40.168 --> 18:41.437
You deserve that.

18:43.171 --> 18:47.109
And he's a lucky someone, whoever he is.

18:48.543 --> 18:49.645
Thank you.

18:50.644 --> 18:52.780
Uh, I hate to cut this short,

18:52.814 --> 18:55.858
but my blood sugar has
plummeted beneath the floor.

18:55.883 --> 18:58.019
So I'm gonna take this
half-eaten plate of pancakes

18:58.052 --> 18:59.388
and destroy it in my car.

19:00.354 --> 19:02.085
Who am I kidding?
I'm not gonna wait till my car.

19:05.947 --> 19:08.016
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

19:08.078 --> 19:09.898
For 12 hours. I'll see you at work.

19:09.930 --> 19:11.570
Yes.

19:11.595 --> 19:12.596
Awkward.

19:13.563 --> 19:14.631
Goodbye, Will.

19:24.312 --> 19:26.548
Did that go as badly as it looked?

19:26.581 --> 19:29.551
Can't believe it's over.

19:29.584 --> 19:30.951
Gonna really miss her.

19:30.985 --> 19:33.955
I am so sorry about Tracy, Will.

19:33.988 --> 19:36.624
If it helps, this place has
a breakfast tea with booze in it

19:36.658 --> 19:38.293
that I swear is better than love.

19:48.341 --> 19:50.210
- Oh, butts.
- All right.

19:50.243 --> 19:51.949
- Uno!
- Uno!

19:51.974 --> 19:53.046
- Dos!
- Dos!

19:53.079 --> 19:54.648
- Three!
- Tres.

19:54.682 --> 19:56.884
Hey, you made the little guy
from the Mucinex commercial.

19:56.916 --> 19:58.285
- Yeah!
- That's awesome.

19:58.319 --> 20:00.320
Hey, Mom, look what Derek got me.

20:00.354 --> 20:02.723
It's shorts! And they're green!

20:02.755 --> 20:04.958
Wow, you are rocking those, buddy!

20:04.992 --> 20:06.059
You want some pancakes?

20:06.092 --> 20:07.727
Oh, no, I'm good.

20:07.761 --> 20:09.963
I'm just gonna give my ol' tum a rest.

20:09.996 --> 20:11.098
Can I talk to you for a second?

20:13.399 --> 20:14.868
I hope you don't mind that I'm here.

20:14.902 --> 20:16.337
I know I'm supposed to stay in the van,

20:16.369 --> 20:18.071
even though I'm pretty sure it's haunted

20:18.105 --> 20:19.574
by the ghost of my dead drummer,

20:19.607 --> 20:21.657
but I just... I didn't
want to leave you alone.

20:21.682 --> 20:23.577
It's fine. The shorts were a hit.

20:23.610 --> 20:26.179
It's not fine. I've been
thinking about what you said.

20:26.213 --> 20:27.481
I'm so sorry.

20:27.513 --> 20:30.383
I know I can't make up
for years of being gone,

20:30.416 --> 20:32.252
but I can try to be better <i> now,</i>

20:32.286 --> 20:33.721
if... if you'll let me.

20:33.753 --> 20:35.356
I appreciate that.

20:36.045 --> 20:37.191
And...

20:37.223 --> 20:39.894
you know what?

20:39.926 --> 20:42.530
Why don't you stay on the couch
for the rest of your trip?

20:42.562 --> 20:43.563
Are you sure?

20:43.597 --> 20:44.764
Yeah.

20:44.798 --> 20:47.234
Obviously, Graham loves having you here,

20:47.268 --> 20:50.905
and my plan to control
everything already went to hell.

20:50.937 --> 20:53.206
So I'm just gonna let everything...

20:53.240 --> 20:54.442
unfold naturally.

20:55.376 --> 20:56.743
Hey, Mom, guess what?

20:56.777 --> 20:59.046
Derek told me I have a half-sister.

20:59.079 --> 21:00.080
What's that, now?

21:00.114 --> 21:01.882
Uh, she's a turtle named Phoebe.

21:01.915 --> 21:03.084
Derek found her on the...

21:03.117 --> 21:04.252
What's it called?

21:04.284 --> 21:05.752
The highway.

21:05.786 --> 21:06.754
So cool.

21:06.787 --> 21:08.889
Can you believe this day?

21:08.922 --> 21:11.626
I've come into shorts <i> and</i> a sister!

21:11.658 --> 21:13.727
Graham D'Amato is cleaning up.

21:13.761 --> 21:16.864
Well, come on, Mom,
you got to have <i> something.</i>

21:16.896 --> 21:17.964
Okay.
