00:55.455 --> 00:58.323
here I am. Oh, good morning, Archie.

00:58.390 --> 01:00.659
Good morning, Edith. And now
that that's out of the way,

01:00.726 --> 01:02.394
let's get to the breakfast.

01:02.461 --> 01:03.862
What would you like?

01:03.929 --> 01:05.931
Well, I got a guy coming over to
see me in a couple of minutes

01:05.998 --> 01:07.565
so, make it something fast. Cereal.

01:07.633 --> 01:11.168
Oh, all right. What kind do you want?

01:11.236 --> 01:13.271
I don't know, Edith. Just surprise me.

01:13.338 --> 01:14.506
Oh, all right.

01:15.574 --> 01:18.175
Ah, I'll give you cheerios.

01:18.710 --> 01:20.612
Why?

01:20.679 --> 01:23.582
Or, would you rather have jolly Jacks?
They're sweeter.

01:23.649 --> 01:25.217
Good.

01:25.284 --> 01:27.552
Or captain crunch is crunchier.

01:28.354 --> 01:29.821
Swell, Edith.

01:29.888 --> 01:31.323
Well, which do you want?

01:31.390 --> 01:33.391
You said you was going to surprise me.

01:33.458 --> 01:36.394
Oh, yeah. I'll give you cocoa puffs.

01:39.231 --> 01:41.499
What a surprise.

01:41.567 --> 01:44.669
Who is this man you're expecting over?

01:44.737 --> 01:47.639
Well, he's the guy that mcnab
introduced me to over at kelcy's.

01:47.707 --> 01:49.507
See, he's got to go over to mcnab's house

01:49.575 --> 01:52.077
and give him a free heating
inspection over there.

01:52.144 --> 01:54.378
So, he was talking to me,
took a liking to me,

01:54.446 --> 01:55.914
said he'd come over, do
the same thing for us.

01:55.981 --> 01:57.415
(Edith) Oh!

01:57.482 --> 01:59.751
He's gonna show us how to
save money on fuel, for free.

01:59.819 --> 02:01.886
Ain't that nice.

02:02.554 --> 02:04.722
What's he selling?

02:04.790 --> 02:08.592
Aren't you listening to me? I said it's for free.
He ain't selling nothing.

02:08.661 --> 02:13.131
Oh. How can he make a
living by selling nothing?

02:13.199 --> 02:14.732
Volume, Edith, volume.

02:16.602 --> 02:19.704
Oh, hi, Louise. Good morning.

02:19.772 --> 02:21.906
Edith, can I borrow your waffle iron?

02:21.974 --> 02:24.676
Ours is broken. Oh, sure.

02:24.744 --> 02:26.645
Well, ours ain't much better there, Louise.

02:26.712 --> 02:28.980
The waffles come out
looking like half soles

02:30.282 --> 02:32.250
no, they don't, Archie.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.951
Here you are. Thanks, Edith.

02:34.019 --> 02:35.987
How's George's cold?

02:36.055 --> 02:37.589
Oh, he hasn't got a cold.

02:37.656 --> 02:40.592
He's got a severe case of hypochondria.

02:40.659 --> 02:43.728
Oh, jeez, Louise. I hope he don't
come spreading that around here.

02:45.731 --> 02:50.501
You're safe, Archie. I don't think
George will give you anything.

02:50.569 --> 02:52.436
Thanks again, Edith.

02:52.504 --> 02:54.205
Hey, Louise.

02:54.273 --> 02:57.509
I hope you ain't gonna cook nothing
funny in that waffle iron.

02:58.711 --> 03:02.680
No. Just the usual. Ribs,
chicken, and pigs' feet.

03:06.985 --> 03:09.887
You know, I ain't so sure
she's kidding there.

03:09.955 --> 03:12.123
Why did you have to lend her that thing?

03:12.190 --> 03:15.292
Archie, Louise is my friend

03:15.360 --> 03:17.695
oh, Edith. When are you going to wise up

03:17.763 --> 03:20.064
in this dog-eat-dog world?

03:20.132 --> 03:22.466
The friends you got you
can count on one hand

03:22.534 --> 03:24.535
leaving out the thumb and pinkie.

03:26.438 --> 03:31.309
Oh, no, Archie. I've got lots of friends.

03:31.376 --> 03:33.377
Wonderful friends.

03:33.446 --> 03:37.816
What would the world be without friends?

03:37.883 --> 03:42.754
That reminds me of a poem I
used to know in high school.

03:42.955 --> 03:44.622
Oh, jeez, a poem.

03:46.092 --> 03:50.027
"Let me live in a house
by the side of the road

03:50.095 --> 03:53.331
where I can be a friend to man"

03:53.399 --> 03:55.666
I heard about them kind
of houses in the army.

04:00.439 --> 04:03.942
Was the people in 'em friendly?

04:08.647 --> 04:10.214
You never wanted to leave.

04:11.616 --> 04:12.516
[Doorbell ringing]

04:12.584 --> 04:14.485
Oh, there's the doorbell.

04:14.553 --> 04:16.721
Yeah, let's go.

04:16.788 --> 04:18.690
That's that guy I was telling you about
to give us the free heating inspection.

04:18.692 --> 04:21.524
But Archie, it's always
so nice and warm in here.

04:21.593 --> 04:23.695
Why do we need a heating inspection?

04:23.762 --> 04:26.964
Edith, the man is going to
show us how to save money.

04:27.032 --> 04:29.066
For free. Will you...

04:29.134 --> 04:30.835
Jeez.

04:30.902 --> 04:33.271
Good morning, Mr. bunker. Good
morning Mr. scanlon. Come right in.

04:33.339 --> 04:36.040
Say hello to the wife Edith
. Edith, say hello to Mr. scanlon.

04:36.108 --> 04:38.809
A pleasure, Mrs. bunker. Oh, thank you.

04:38.877 --> 04:40.945
He's gonna be a big help to us.

04:41.012 --> 04:44.081
Yes, help is what the home energy
conservation program is all about.

04:44.149 --> 04:45.883
Yeah, you hear that?

04:45.951 --> 04:47.585
It's a program, Edith. Kind of official.
Right, Mr. scanlon?

04:47.720 --> 04:50.621
Well, you've read what the
president said about saving fuel.

04:50.689 --> 04:52.657
Oh-ho, don't I know it. Them arabs

04:52.724 --> 04:55.260
has got the whole nation
over one of their barrels.

04:56.828 --> 04:59.229
You're very perceptive, Mr. bunker.

04:59.297 --> 05:02.399
That's exactly where those arabs have got us.
Over a barrel.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.836
Now, uh, how many rooms do we have here?

05:04.903 --> 05:10.107
Uh, here we got, uh, 6 rooms,
Mr. scanlon, uh, including the toilet.

05:10.175 --> 05:13.077
And, uh, talking about
toilets, Mr. scanlon,

05:13.144 --> 05:15.713
you being in the government,
kind of like an engineer,

05:15.781 --> 05:17.715
I'd like to tell you about an idea of mine.

05:17.783 --> 05:21.085
Well, we're always interested in
new ideas, Mr. bunker. What is it?

05:21.152 --> 05:22.920
An electric toilet seat

05:27.326 --> 05:29.627
yeah. I got the idea one freezing morning

05:29.694 --> 05:32.630
after the wife left the bathroom
window open all night long.

05:34.066 --> 05:36.734
It, uh, it works like, uh,
your electric toaster

05:36.802 --> 05:39.003
only it don't pop you off the seat.

05:43.241 --> 05:47.144
That's--that's a very
interesting idea, Mr. bunker.

05:47.212 --> 05:50.582
Yeah. I'm thinking I'll call
it "the bunker bun warmer."

05:53.919 --> 05:56.754
Well, I'll, uh, I'll certainly suggest that

05:56.822 --> 05:58.923
to the department of the interior.

05:58.990 --> 06:01.492
Yes, well, now, how many rooms?
You said 6. Is that it?

06:01.559 --> 06:03.194
Yeah, we got 6 rooms here, Mr. scanlon.

06:03.262 --> 06:06.063
All right. Now that would be about,

06:06.131 --> 06:10.234
uh, oh, 34,000 cubic feet

06:10.302 --> 06:14.038
with a heating capacity of, uh,

06:14.106 --> 06:16.207
oh, that would come to about,

06:16.275 --> 06:20.111
uh, 125,000 b. T.U.'S.

06:21.112 --> 06:22.280
[Whistling]

06:22.347 --> 06:24.715
125,000 of 'em, huh?

06:25.584 --> 06:28.719
What's a b.T.U., Archie?

06:28.787 --> 06:31.755
Oh, well, Edith, a b.T.U., uh,
in the heating profession

06:31.823 --> 06:34.092
is just, uh, one of 'em things that...
Mr. scanlon.

06:34.159 --> 06:39.197
Oh, a b.T.U., Mrs. bunker, means
British thermal units. Yeah.

06:39.265 --> 06:41.399
I think we traded some destroyers for them.

06:43.235 --> 06:45.036
(Archie) What do you got
there, Mr. scanlon?

06:45.104 --> 06:48.372
Well, this meter is a specially
designed instrument which measures

06:48.440 --> 06:50.708
the amount of heat that's
being contained in your home.

06:50.776 --> 06:52.743
Oh, yeah? Yes.

06:52.811 --> 06:55.613
Well, look at that, Edith.

06:55.681 --> 06:58.082
Well, everything seems
to be all right here.

06:58.149 --> 07:01.385
Why don't we just walk over towards
that wall and see what happens.

07:01.453 --> 07:02.687
Yeah. Go ahead.

07:06.024 --> 07:08.225
Well, hey, hey, hey Edith. Look at that.

07:08.293 --> 07:11.629
You see that little needle
jumping into the red there?

07:11.697 --> 07:13.898
By golly, you're right, Mr. bunker.

07:13.966 --> 07:16.767
Is that bad? Anything red is bad.

07:19.471 --> 07:21.539
In this case, it is bad, Mr. bunker.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.708
Because it's warning us about a heat loss.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.578
Probably due to improper insulation.
May I check your furnace?

07:26.645 --> 07:29.447
Oh the furnace. Yeah, sure, Mr. scanlon.
Come with me.

07:29.514 --> 07:30.848
Right this way.

07:30.916 --> 07:33.484
You just go through this door here and uh,

07:33.552 --> 07:36.721
right down 'em cellar steps.
Look out for the third step

07:36.789 --> 07:38.356
uh, why? It ain't there.

07:42.428 --> 07:43.561
Well, thank you.

07:50.035 --> 07:51.769
Oh, jeez. Look at this.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.074
What the hell are you doing?

07:57.810 --> 07:59.777
You mind telling me?

07:59.845 --> 08:01.612
I'm measuring the heat.

08:03.915 --> 08:07.485
Well, it's just a warm over
here as it is over there.

08:10.088 --> 08:13.457
Oh. I don't feel no heat missing.

08:13.525 --> 08:16.561
Will you stop that with your fingers there?

08:16.629 --> 08:20.097
Since when are you a heat meter, huh?

08:20.165 --> 08:23.667
Folks, I've got some bad news for you.

08:23.736 --> 08:25.002
What?

08:25.070 --> 08:27.371
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to red tag your furnace.

08:27.439 --> 08:29.774
Oh, w-wait a minute, Mr. scanlon, uh,

08:29.841 --> 08:32.443
red--red tag? What is that?

08:32.510 --> 08:35.580
Well, it's a warning to
keep out of your basement.

08:35.648 --> 08:39.417
You have a very dangerous
situation down there, Mr. bunker.

08:39.485 --> 08:41.318
You have such a great heat loss

08:41.386 --> 08:43.421
that it's forcing your furnace to overwork.

08:43.488 --> 08:45.523
Now, may I use your telephone?

08:45.525 --> 08:47.859
Well, sure, Mr. scanlon. It's right over there.
But, uh, who you going to call up?

08:47.926 --> 08:50.395
Well, I have to notify the
bureau of furnace control.

08:50.462 --> 08:53.964
See, they'll shut of your heat
until you get a larger furnace.

08:54.032 --> 08:55.599
[Stuttering] Wait there.

08:55.668 --> 08:58.703
They can't shut off our heat.
It's winter time!

08:58.771 --> 09:00.938
Well, I have to go by
the book, Mrs. bunker.

09:01.006 --> 09:03.675
Well, w-wait a minute Mr. scanlon.
Don't call. Gee.

09:03.742 --> 09:06.878
I hate calling up them bureaus, see?

09:06.945 --> 09:08.813
And I can't get a larger your furnace.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.215
I can't afford it. Cost me about $2000.

09:11.283 --> 09:13.217
Is there anything else I could do?

09:13.285 --> 09:15.553
Well, there is another solution.
Yeah, what?

09:15.621 --> 09:18.856
We'll insulate your house
with aluminum siding.

09:18.924 --> 09:21.525
How much would that cost? $2,000.

09:21.593 --> 09:24.395
Oh, hell! Oh, my!

09:24.463 --> 09:26.664
It never rains, but it pours. Doesn't it?

09:26.731 --> 09:29.067
Oh, jeez. Well, how are
we going to get our heat?

09:29.134 --> 09:31.402
How the hell do I know?
Set the house on fire.

09:35.140 --> 09:36.941
Don't you think you better go down

09:37.009 --> 09:39.043
and check the furnace yourself?

09:39.111 --> 09:42.646
I can't pass that red tag.
It's against the law.

09:42.714 --> 09:47.418
Mr. scanlon, uh, listen, if--if you could
figure out something for us to do, uh...

09:47.486 --> 09:49.753
You know that toilet seat idea of mine?

09:49.821 --> 09:51.622
That's yours for nothing.

09:53.359 --> 09:55.593
There may be another way. Yeah?

09:56.862 --> 09:58.128
What's this?

09:58.196 --> 10:00.765
Oh, now, this is a map
of your area of queens.

10:00.833 --> 10:04.369
Now if Mr. mcnab does not
accept our free offer--

10:04.436 --> 10:07.638
wait a minute, wait a minute. You
made mcnab a free offer or something?

10:07.640 --> 10:09.740
Well, uh, I also happen to represent

10:09.808 --> 10:12.443
you see, the home owners
aluminum siding corporation.

10:12.511 --> 10:14.979
Now we could use a model home in this area.

10:15.046 --> 10:18.516
You see, if a home owner allows us
to use his home as a show place

10:18.584 --> 10:20.585
we give him the aluminum for nothing.

10:20.652 --> 10:24.221
You give him aluminum for--for nothing?
Hey, hey, hey. I want that deal

10:26.291 --> 10:29.961
hold on now, just a minute, Mr. bunker.
I think it's only fair

10:30.028 --> 10:32.063
that I make this offer to Mr. mcnab first.

10:32.130 --> 10:35.599
No, no, no. Wait a minute. You made
that offer to me first. Just now.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.902
And you did accept, didn't you?

10:39.171 --> 10:42.039
I most certainly did. Edith
is there as my witness.

10:42.807 --> 10:45.709
Yeah, but, I--I...

10:45.777 --> 10:48.712
[Chuckling] You drive a
hard bargain, Mr. bunker.

10:51.150 --> 10:55.019
All right. The deal is yours. Great, great.
What do we do?

10:55.086 --> 10:57.888
But, now, I have to warn you.
This being a model home

10:57.956 --> 11:02.160
you'll have to allow potential buyers to
come here, in order to see for themselves

11:02.227 --> 11:04.362
what a great job aluminum does.

11:04.430 --> 11:06.897
Yeah, well, that's all right.
That seems fair enough, huh?

11:06.965 --> 11:08.499
But, Archie, I don't want--

11:08.566 --> 11:11.268
now I have the short term contract here.
Which explains the whole deal.

11:11.336 --> 11:14.238
But I want you to read it over very,
very carefully before you sign.

11:14.306 --> 11:17.108
Oh, I always read contracts
there, Mr. scanlon.

11:17.176 --> 11:20.178
But the print in here is pretty small.

11:20.245 --> 11:22.847
Sir? Oh, uh, thank you very much.

11:22.915 --> 11:24.281
Let me see.

11:24.349 --> 11:26.283
"Home owners aluminum company

11:26.351 --> 11:28.019
"agrees to furnish

11:28.087 --> 11:30.554
(both) Absolutely free
all fitting sidings"--

11:30.622 --> 11:33.191
stop blowing in my ear.

11:33.258 --> 11:35.226
I can't hear myself read this thing.

11:35.293 --> 11:39.463
Uh-oh, it's supposed to be free.

11:39.531 --> 11:43.667
It's says here, "upon receipt
of the aluminum sidings,

11:43.736 --> 11:47.438
the client agrees to pay for
shipping and installation."

11:47.505 --> 11:49.406
Oh, now. That's just for
your own protection.

11:49.474 --> 11:52.710
That way you don't pay a gift
tax on the free aluminum.

11:52.778 --> 11:54.979
No gift tax? See how good you come out?

11:55.047 --> 11:56.180
(Edith) But how much--

11:56.247 --> 11:58.382
and another thing I forgot to tell you.

11:58.450 --> 12:00.651
If you could interest any of our
friends in our aluminum siding,

12:00.718 --> 12:03.287
I will give you 10 percent
on any leads you bring in.

12:03.354 --> 12:05.555
1o percent? Jeez, that's terrific!

12:05.624 --> 12:07.224
You'd like $200, wouldn't you?

12:07.292 --> 12:09.761
Oh-ho, does a rabbit like another rabbit?

12:12.064 --> 12:14.531
Yes, I want that deal right now.

12:14.599 --> 12:16.567
But, Archie-- stifle yourself.

12:17.936 --> 12:19.670
Oh. Here--here we are.

12:20.438 --> 12:23.941
A. Bunker. There.

12:24.009 --> 12:26.844
Very good. Now, and here's
your copy of the contract.

12:26.912 --> 12:31.415
Oh, that's swell, Mr. scanlon. When can
we expect your men to start working?

12:31.483 --> 12:33.617
Well, I'll have the truck
here this afternoon.

12:33.685 --> 12:36.620
Oh, gee, that's swell, Mr. scanlon. Thanks.

12:36.688 --> 12:39.856
But, Mr. scanlon, what about our furnace

12:39.924 --> 12:42.193
and all them b.T.U.'S?

12:42.260 --> 12:44.461
Is it going to blow up?

12:44.529 --> 12:46.263
Oh, yeah, that's a good thought, there.

12:46.331 --> 12:48.232
I mean, you know, there ain't no sense

12:48.300 --> 12:51.135
to put aluminum around a house
that ain't going to be here.

12:51.202 --> 12:53.804
All you have to do is
turn the thermostat down

12:53.871 --> 12:55.872
until we get the aluminum siding up.

12:55.940 --> 12:57.608
Good thinking, Mr. scanlon

12:57.676 --> 12:59.443
it's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

12:59.511 --> 13:00.777
And congratulations.

13:00.845 --> 13:02.679
Oh, thank you.

13:02.747 --> 13:04.815
You're going to just love aluminum.

13:08.987 --> 13:13.090
Archie, are you sure we can afford this?

13:13.157 --> 13:17.228
Edith, what is to afford?
We ain't buying nothing.

13:17.230 --> 13:20.831
Why do I feel like we've
been sold something?

13:23.068 --> 13:27.004
'Cause you never believe nothing, Edith.
You're one of them septics.

13:32.043 --> 13:33.443
[Doorbell ringing]

13:33.512 --> 13:34.711
I'll get it.

13:34.779 --> 13:38.315
I will never, never understand
why some people are

13:38.383 --> 13:40.985
always looking a gift horse in the eye.

13:43.021 --> 13:44.955
Oh, hi, Irene. Oh, hi, Edith

13:45.023 --> 13:48.626
hi, Archie, I just had to come
over when I saw that guy scanlon

13:48.694 --> 13:49.694
leaving your house.

13:49.761 --> 13:50.894
I want to talk to you about that--

13:50.962 --> 13:52.930
was he at your place, too?

13:52.998 --> 13:54.665
Yeah, how 'bout that character?

13:54.732 --> 13:58.002
Using a photographer's light
meter to measure heat.

13:58.070 --> 13:59.570
[Laughing]

13:59.637 --> 14:01.639
Wait a minute, wait a minute, using a what?

14:01.706 --> 14:03.274
A light meter.

14:03.342 --> 14:07.078
Oh, oh, if you didn't see that, then
you missed the best part of his act.

14:07.145 --> 14:10.214
Oh, I don't think we missed nothing.

14:12.550 --> 14:14.785
Get this, this--this con artist

14:14.853 --> 14:16.854
with a, a light meter in his hand

14:16.922 --> 14:18.989
walks toward my window.

14:19.057 --> 14:21.926
And--and of course the light makes
the needle jump into the red zone.

14:21.993 --> 14:25.930
So then he tries to tell me that
that's because of a loss of heat.

14:25.997 --> 14:27.164
[Laughing]

14:33.137 --> 14:35.606
Can you imagine anyone in their right mind

14:35.673 --> 14:38.075
falling for a dumb gag like that?

14:38.143 --> 14:39.776
[Laughing]

14:53.658 --> 14:56.326
Well, he said we can have it for nothing

14:56.395 --> 14:58.829
if we let people come in here

14:58.897 --> 15:01.231
and feel our b. T.U.'S.

15:04.135 --> 15:06.803
Archie, believe me. You've been had.

15:06.871 --> 15:10.607
Don't keep saying that, will you, Irene.
'Cause I ain't been had.

15:10.675 --> 15:12.576
Maybe then we've been took.

15:14.312 --> 15:18.115
Archie, you need aluminum like
a moose needs a shower cap.

15:19.351 --> 15:21.818
Maybe we ought to call a lawyer.

15:21.886 --> 15:23.354
[Groaning] That's a good idea.

15:23.421 --> 15:26.289
Hey, listen, I can get Franks nephew Tony.

15:26.358 --> 15:28.892
To look over your contract and
it won't cost you a cent.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.962
Listen--listen, Irene, I don't
want Frank's nephew Tony.

15:32.030 --> 15:35.399
I don't want no lawyers at all.
I just want the two of youse

15:35.466 --> 15:36.600
to leave me alone.

15:36.667 --> 15:39.336
Archie, I'm just trying to help you.

15:39.404 --> 15:42.572
Wait a minute, oh, oh, Archie,
Irene's just trying to help.

15:42.640 --> 15:47.778
Listen, Irene, when I need help,
I'll write to "dear Abby."

15:47.846 --> 15:53.184
Now I'm telling youse two for the last time,
I made a deal and it was a good deal.

15:53.251 --> 15:56.520
You and the Indian who
sold New York for $24.

15:58.456 --> 16:01.225
Don't be comparing me
to no ignorant Indian.

16:01.292 --> 16:04.795
Oh, I won't I never saw
aluminum siding on a tee pee.

16:08.333 --> 16:12.503
Irene, why don't you take that nose of
yours and peck on a tree for a while.

16:15.072 --> 16:18.042
Hey, it's freezing in here. Who
turned down the thermostat?

16:18.110 --> 16:20.511
Little girl, you didn't touch
that thermostat, did you?

16:20.578 --> 16:21.812
Well, sure, I turned it up again.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.047
Get out of the way here

16:23.114 --> 16:24.981
don't even touch that thing, for...

16:25.049 --> 16:26.983
You want to blow us all
through the roof here?

16:27.051 --> 16:28.385
What is the matter?

16:28.453 --> 16:31.021
Don't nobody fool with this
instrument on the wall here

16:31.088 --> 16:33.624
until we get the aluminum on the house.

16:33.691 --> 16:34.825
What aluminum?

16:35.693 --> 16:36.894
This aluminum.

16:37.896 --> 16:40.397
Arch, you signed a contract

16:40.465 --> 16:43.534
to put aluminum siding
around a brick house?

16:51.642 --> 16:53.143
Yes, I did.

16:54.478 --> 16:56.046
Who sold you that idea?

16:56.114 --> 16:58.949
None of your business.
Give me that contract.

16:59.016 --> 17:01.318
Why do we need aluminum siding?

17:01.386 --> 17:05.521
Because, little girl, we got a serious
heat-loss problem in this house.

17:05.589 --> 17:08.058
Oh, arch, arch, I don't think this is

17:08.126 --> 17:10.060
one the reputable aluminum
firms around here.

17:10.127 --> 17:13.063
I think we ought to check this thing
out with a better business bureau.

17:13.131 --> 17:15.832
What is better business getting
something for nothing, huh?

17:15.900 --> 17:18.035
Why do you always think I'm getting stuck?

17:18.103 --> 17:21.338
I don't think you're getting stuck.
I think you're getting harpooned.

17:22.874 --> 17:24.808
Try and disappear, huh?

17:26.511 --> 17:29.246
I see Mrs. podinski left, huh?

17:29.314 --> 17:32.683
You mean Irene? Yes, she went home.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.451
Good. I hope it was something I said.

17:34.519 --> 17:35.719
[Knocking on door]

17:35.786 --> 17:37.954
Oh, come in, Mr. Jefferson.

17:38.022 --> 17:40.157
Here's your waffle iron, Edith.
And thank you very much.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.825
Oh, you're welcome.

17:41.892 --> 17:44.661
Ah, George, it's nice to see you.
Hey, did you enjoy the waffles?

17:44.729 --> 17:48.031
Did you know those waffles come
out looking like half soles?

17:48.100 --> 17:50.167
Yeah. Hey, George, I'm
glad you dropped over

17:50.235 --> 17:52.902
there's something I want to talk to you about.
Edith, would you step into

17:52.970 --> 17:55.839
the sitting room for a minute? I
want to talk to George in private.

17:55.907 --> 17:59.342
Oh, that's nice. Excuse me.

17:59.410 --> 18:02.980
George, I hear you got
a terrific cold. Huh?

18:03.048 --> 18:05.082
You're gonna keep on getting colds, George,

18:05.150 --> 18:07.551
until you get that house of yours insulated

18:07.618 --> 18:10.454
with aluminum sidings
which I can get for you.

18:10.521 --> 18:12.389
Aluminum siding? Yeah.

18:12.457 --> 18:13.657
Ain't that pretty expensive?

18:13.725 --> 18:16.560
Well, no. Not when you think
of all the money you save.

18:16.628 --> 18:18.395
I-I-I'm going to have 'em done here.

18:18.463 --> 18:21.799
See, my house is going to be, uh, one
of 'em, what do you call, model houses.

18:21.866 --> 18:23.867
Oh, yeah. First they put it
on your house right? Yeah.

18:23.935 --> 18:26.236
And then people come over and
look at your house that's right.

18:26.304 --> 18:30.407
And it's only going to cost you $1,955.11.

18:30.475 --> 18:32.375
Wait a minute. Where did
you get them figures?

18:32.443 --> 18:34.545
Well, that's what it cost my
brother-in-law for his model home

18:34.612 --> 18:36.780
6 months ago when he got ripped off.

18:39.217 --> 18:40.951
What do you mean "ripped off"?

18:41.019 --> 18:43.821
And they call that rip off
"shipping and installation fees."

18:43.888 --> 18:46.356
Can't you dig it? You're
getting the aluminum shaft.

18:49.594 --> 18:51.462
When they slap that stuff on this house,

18:51.529 --> 18:53.964
this place is going to look
like a 6-room car wash. Bye.

18:57.769 --> 19:00.670
Hey, Edith. Oh boy! Edith! Edith!

19:02.607 --> 19:04.808
It's freezing in this house.

19:04.876 --> 19:07.277
Did you get Irene's nephew
on the phone yet? No, no,

19:07.345 --> 19:10.247
I can't. Irene's line is still busy.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.082
Ah, gee, give me the phone book.

19:12.150 --> 19:14.552
I'll call the guy direct what's his name?

19:14.619 --> 19:16.986
Oh, it's, uh, Tony something.

19:17.054 --> 19:20.190
Jeez, all Italians are Tony something.

19:20.257 --> 19:24.060
She's supposed to be your best friend and
you don't even know her nephew's name?

19:24.128 --> 19:27.598
Daddy, men outside on a ladder are
looking right in the bedroom window.

19:27.665 --> 19:31.201
Yeah, and there are 2 trucks out there
with enough aluminum to build a 747.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.471
What are they doing out...

19:34.539 --> 19:38.142
Oh, they're starting work already, Edith.
We can't wait for Tony the lawyer.

19:38.209 --> 19:40.644
Call our own lawyers the 3 rubinowitzes.

19:40.712 --> 19:41.979
Which...

19:42.047 --> 19:44.081
Which one do you want to talk to?

19:44.149 --> 19:46.182
Get the old man. He's the most Jewish.

19:47.886 --> 19:50.687
Well, Mr. bunker, true to my word, my
trucks are here with the aluminum.

19:50.755 --> 19:54.524
Uh, well, uh, Mr. scanlon, uh, since I was
talking to you last time my wife here

19:54.592 --> 19:58.228
she was reminding me that I got a, kind of,
what do you call, allergy to aluminum.

19:59.797 --> 20:02.733
Yeah, he gets sick when he
finds out he's been taken.

20:02.801 --> 20:04.568
How much is all this going to cost?

20:04.636 --> 20:06.537
Well, whatever the charges come to.

20:06.604 --> 20:08.772
Now we have a contract, Mr. bunker.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.307
Signed under duress.

20:10.408 --> 20:12.743
Yeah, without knowing I
was under the dress.

20:14.412 --> 20:15.913
[Banging]

20:15.981 --> 20:17.647
Oh, gee, what is this? What is this?

20:17.715 --> 20:20.917
Hey, hey! Hey, you guys. Cut that out.
Get the ladders

20:20.986 --> 20:22.919
away from my house, you. Get out of here.

20:22.988 --> 20:25.522
Scanlon, call your men off now
and tell them to go home.

20:25.590 --> 20:27.424
Now I can't do that, Mr. bunker.

20:27.492 --> 20:28.892
Somebody say something here?

20:28.960 --> 20:31.461
Yeah, I said "get out of here." To him.

20:35.266 --> 20:37.033
Never mind, Leonard.

20:37.101 --> 20:38.769
Look, Mr. scanlon, if you don't
get your men to stop working

20:38.836 --> 20:40.937
we'll call the department
of consumer affairs.

20:41.005 --> 20:44.307
Well, you do that, young lady, they'll
be open bright and early Monday morning.

20:44.609 --> 20:48.445
I got to get back to work we got 2
more model homes to do on this block.

20:48.513 --> 20:51.314
2 more model homes on this block?

20:51.382 --> 20:54.684
Street's going to look
like a row of beer cans.

20:54.752 --> 20:57.421
You can't stand that. Did
you get the rubinowitzes?

20:57.488 --> 21:00.190
No, they're all in Miami.

21:02.460 --> 21:04.895
Ah, we are up the creek without a saddle.

21:06.397 --> 21:08.232
I'm going to put a stop to this, bunker.

21:08.299 --> 21:10.667
George told me what happened and
I went out and got a policeman.

21:10.735 --> 21:12.569
All right, mack, what have you been up to?

21:12.637 --> 21:14.104
Hold it, hold it, I ain't the crook.

21:14.172 --> 21:17.741
The crook is the
honest-looking guy over there.

21:17.809 --> 21:21.144
Well now, he signed a contract, officer.
I'm not doing anything illegal.

21:21.211 --> 21:24.281
Ain't there some kind of law against
taking advantage of the simple-minded?

21:29.854 --> 21:32.522
Well, is there? 'Cause if there
ain't, there ought to be.

21:34.558 --> 21:37.827
This happened to my brother, and I don't
want to see it happen to my friend.

21:37.895 --> 21:40.297
[All chattering]

21:41.232 --> 21:43.901
Hold, hold it, hold.

21:43.968 --> 21:46.904
Now did you sign a contract
with this individual?

21:46.971 --> 21:49.139
Well for aluminum siding,
yeah, but you see--

21:49.206 --> 21:52.176
there's nothing I can do. There
ain't been no crime committed.

21:52.243 --> 21:54.711
Since when ain't robbery a crime, officer?

21:54.779 --> 21:55.913
I mean after all...

21:55.980 --> 21:57.047
[Banging]

21:57.114 --> 21:58.214
L-listen to this

21:58.282 --> 21:59.650
I hear it. We better do something.

21:59.717 --> 22:02.218
They're sealing us in
like a can of mixed nuts.

22:03.688 --> 22:05.656
Look, mack,

22:05.723 --> 22:07.424
you're not the first one to
complain about this kind of thing.

22:07.492 --> 22:09.293
But there's nothing I can do.

22:09.360 --> 22:12.529
Archie, Archie, I just finished talking
to Frank's nephew on the phone.

22:12.597 --> 22:13.930
What good is he on the phone?

22:13.998 --> 22:16.800
Look. He told me to check
out all of these points.

22:16.868 --> 22:21.104
Now, you've got have a remodeling
permit in a visible location.

22:21.172 --> 22:22.473
A remodeling permit?

22:22.540 --> 22:24.241
Yeah, that's right, Buster.
You got one of them?

22:24.309 --> 22:25.875
Oh, that just a technicality, officer.

22:25.943 --> 22:29.512
He also needs a license from the
department of consumer affairs

22:29.580 --> 22:31.648
to operate a business in
the city of New York.

22:31.716 --> 22:33.550
I've applied for that.

22:33.552 --> 22:36.352
Ah, well, you also need a salesman's
license and a contractor's license

22:36.421 --> 22:37.921
paid to date.

22:37.988 --> 22:40.023
Uh, have you got any of
those things Mr. scanlon?

22:40.091 --> 22:42.759
I bet the bum don't even
have a driver's license.

22:45.096 --> 22:47.030
It's my opinion that we have enough here

22:47.098 --> 22:49.800
to let the bunko squad take over.

22:49.867 --> 22:53.737
Oh, well, now, officer
. There's no need for that.

22:53.805 --> 22:56.172
If a customer is not satisfied,

22:56.240 --> 22:59.743
and not completely happy with the
job, we have a policy whereby

22:59.811 --> 23:01.812
we could just forget the whole deal.

23:03.214 --> 23:04.781
Well, that takes care of that.

23:04.849 --> 23:06.382
And, uh, Mr. slick,

23:06.450 --> 23:09.252
I happen to notice your truck
has one wheel on the side walk.

23:09.320 --> 23:11.421
New ticket for you.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.961
Uh, officer, can't we talk this over?

23:19.297 --> 23:20.230
Hey, Irene,

23:20.632 --> 23:22.299
Irene,

23:22.367 --> 23:25.335
did Tony the lawyer say anything
about maybe suing this guy scanlon?

23:25.403 --> 23:27.804
'Cause I hate to come out
of this thing empty-handed.

23:27.872 --> 23:29.339
Archie.

23:30.675 --> 23:33.209
Oh, you ain't empty-handed.

23:33.277 --> 23:36.279
You're rich, you got friends.

23:36.347 --> 23:37.413
Ah, jeez.

23:37.481 --> 23:39.816
You got another poem for that, Edith?

23:40.918 --> 23:41.918
Yeah.

23:43.788 --> 23:47.491
"There are gold ships
there are silver ships

23:47.558 --> 23:50.960
but there's no ship like friendship"

24:21.492 --> 24:23.493
<i>(male announcer)</i> <i>All in the
family</i> <i>was recorded on tape</i>

24:23.561 --> 24:24.494
