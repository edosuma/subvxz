00:10.000 --> 00:11.916
[theme music playing]

01:14.041 --> 01:15.708
[Flora, echoing] She hasn't moved.

01:16.208 --> 01:18.500
[Miles, echoing]
Are you certain? I don't like this.

01:19.125 --> 01:20.250
[Flora] Neither do I.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.541
[Miles] We're not arguing, it's just…

01:23.625 --> 01:26.375
It's more that I don't see
how this is part of the game.

01:26.916 --> 01:28.958
[Flora] People shouldn't bleed in games.

01:32.708 --> 01:34.583
Oh, see?

01:35.125 --> 01:36.416
Here she comes.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.500
[in clear voice]
Were you tucked away just now?

01:41.583 --> 01:43.208
-[muffled moans]
-[Flora] Where did you go?

01:43.291 --> 01:45.000
If you don't mind me asking.

01:46.416 --> 01:47.791
But why not?

01:48.666 --> 01:50.583
-[Dani crying]
-She's our friend.

01:50.666 --> 01:51.708
[screams]

01:52.541 --> 01:55.333
-[Dani screams]
-She's worried. Look.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.416
[screaming]

01:57.500 --> 01:59.125
[Miles] She can't even hear you.

01:59.208 --> 02:02.083
I think she'd feel better
if you told her this yourselves.

02:02.166 --> 02:03.791
[Dani continues moaning]

02:05.375 --> 02:07.250
Come on. She's scared.

02:08.125 --> 02:09.375
[panting and crying]

02:13.416 --> 02:15.333
[panicked moaning]

02:20.708 --> 02:23.166
[Dani whimpering]

02:28.041 --> 02:29.541
What's the matter, Miles?

02:31.125 --> 02:32.250
Like I said,

02:32.833 --> 02:34.041
this feels wrong.

02:34.916 --> 02:35.750
You know…

02:37.291 --> 02:39.625
life is a bit funny in that way.

02:40.791 --> 02:41.958
Sometimes,

02:42.541 --> 02:45.041
right can seem wrong,
and wrong can seem right.

02:45.541 --> 02:47.291
[Dani continues moaning]

02:47.375 --> 02:50.041
But that's the difference
between children and adults.

02:50.625 --> 02:51.833
Seeing the big picture.

02:51.916 --> 02:53.041
Now, you can see it.

02:53.750 --> 02:54.750
And…

02:54.833 --> 02:55.875
I already know that.

02:56.708 --> 02:58.083
Like the bird at school.

02:59.041 --> 02:59.958
You see…

03:00.666 --> 03:02.125
that felt wrong,

03:02.625 --> 03:05.625
but it got you back home to Flora,
and she needed you home.

03:06.375 --> 03:09.791
So, you did what you had to do
in order to keep Flora safe.

03:09.875 --> 03:10.958
It's not the same.

03:11.041 --> 03:13.000
Oh, heavens, no. No.

03:13.083 --> 03:14.250
Helping someone be quiet

03:14.333 --> 03:16.583
is not even a little bit
the same as the bird.

03:17.041 --> 03:19.791
-But you've done nothing wrong, okay?
-[Dani panting]

03:20.375 --> 03:21.208
[Peter] Both of you.

03:21.958 --> 03:23.708
-Nothing wrong.
-[Miles] She's hurt.

03:23.791 --> 03:26.166
[Peter] No, she's not hurt. She's just…

03:26.833 --> 03:27.666
scared.

03:27.750 --> 03:28.958
[Dani crying]

03:29.458 --> 03:30.666
She doesn't know yet…

03:30.750 --> 03:32.958
there's nothing to be scared of here.

03:35.166 --> 03:36.625
Please, don't be frightened.

03:38.458 --> 03:40.583
C-Can't you just tuck her away?

03:40.666 --> 03:41.875
Somewhere nice,

03:41.958 --> 03:44.875
till she feels a little bit better.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.250
[Dani moaning softly]

03:47.416 --> 03:51.041
Where would you like to go,
if you could pick anything?

03:51.125 --> 03:54.958
-The best thing you can remember.
-It's not quite that simple, Flora.

03:56.791 --> 03:57.625
Why not?

03:59.708 --> 04:02.500
Well, she's never gone
dream-hopping before, has she?

04:03.125 --> 04:04.875
I mean, it takes a little practice.

04:05.416 --> 04:06.583
Remember?

04:06.666 --> 04:07.833
She's very clever.

04:08.500 --> 04:09.833
She'll learn fast.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.541
Faster than me, I think.

04:12.625 --> 04:14.375
[Rebecca] It's different, Flora.

04:14.458 --> 04:16.416
It's not quite the same.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.708
-[Hannah, echoing] <i>Priceless heirlooms.</i>
-It's… It--

04:19.833 --> 04:20.666
Um…

04:21.375 --> 04:24.416
-Well, I mean, it--
-[Hannah, echoing] <i>Priceless heirlooms.</i>

04:24.500 --> 04:26.625
<i>-They're not missing, they're stolen.</i>
<i>-</i>[Rebecca] Well…

04:26.708 --> 04:27.875
-Um, it's…
-[Dani moaning]

04:27.958 --> 04:29.958
-[Hannah] <i>They're not missing.</i>
-I mean, um, it's…

04:30.041 --> 04:31.750
<i>-</i>[Hannah] <i>They're stolen.</i>
-I…

04:31.833 --> 04:34.041
-[Hannah] <i>Priceless heirlooms.</i>
-Becs, you're slipping.

04:34.125 --> 04:36.083
Becs, Becs, you're slipping. Stay with me.

04:36.166 --> 04:37.166
Becs! Becs!

04:37.250 --> 04:39.083
[Dani breathing rapidly]

04:41.875 --> 04:42.708
It's okay.

04:45.541 --> 04:48.708
It's okay, kids. She's just, uh…
she's dream-hopping a little.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.166
She'll be back.

04:55.750 --> 04:57.291
The important thing is…

04:57.916 --> 04:59.708
is we need to figure out

04:59.791 --> 05:02.208
-what to do with our friend here.
-[muffled moaning]

05:02.833 --> 05:05.750
I mean, she could get us
in a lot of trouble, couldn't she?

05:07.708 --> 05:10.208
So, we need to find a way…

05:11.416 --> 05:12.250
to help her…

05:12.958 --> 05:13.958
but also…

05:14.500 --> 05:17.166
maybe make it so
that she could dream-hop, too.

05:17.666 --> 05:19.583
Wouldn't you want that for her?

05:19.666 --> 05:20.583
For her to learn?

05:23.250 --> 05:24.250
[Dani] No!

05:25.666 --> 05:28.500
It isn't always very convenient,

05:28.583 --> 05:31.125
and I don't like it much

05:31.208 --> 05:33.333
when it happens unexpectedly,

05:34.041 --> 05:36.041
but, the other times,

05:36.541 --> 05:38.416
it's perfectly splendid.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.791
-[crying]
-[melancholy music playing]

05:41.708 --> 05:42.625
You'll like it.

05:43.791 --> 05:44.625
But…

05:45.125 --> 05:47.208
there are different keys, aren't there?

05:48.375 --> 05:49.291
[knocking on door]

05:52.458 --> 05:54.083
[loud knocking]

05:54.583 --> 05:56.833
[Peter] That's Hannah, at the door.

05:58.250 --> 06:01.291
Right, Miles,
I need you to say exactly what I tell you.

06:01.375 --> 06:02.208
What?

06:02.291 --> 06:04.875
-When she knocks again, I need you--
-Knocks?

06:05.375 --> 06:09.458
Again, I need you to talk to her,
but don't open the door,

06:09.541 --> 06:11.666
and you say exactly what I tell you.

06:11.750 --> 06:13.291
I don't hear any.

06:13.375 --> 06:14.958
Any knocking, I mean.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.625
-[Peter] No.
-[pounding on door]

06:17.916 --> 06:19.291
[Flora] He's hopping away.

06:19.833 --> 06:21.666
-What should we do?
-[pounding continues]

06:21.750 --> 06:25.125
[Flora] We never can tell,
just when you're going to be back.

06:25.208 --> 06:26.333
[jarring musical crescendo]

06:29.208 --> 06:30.041
No.

06:30.666 --> 06:32.083
[woman] That's what you say to me.

06:33.125 --> 06:34.541
All this time,

06:35.125 --> 06:36.333
that's what you say.

06:37.958 --> 06:39.250
And look at this.

06:41.333 --> 06:42.291
Look at you.

06:43.125 --> 06:44.875
And look at this.

06:49.750 --> 06:50.750
You're-- You're out?

06:52.041 --> 06:52.875
I'm out.

06:59.708 --> 07:00.916
How long this time?

07:01.458 --> 07:02.291
[woman] Forever.

07:03.083 --> 07:06.041
Well, I suppose they'd say I'm cured.
[chuckles softly]

07:06.541 --> 07:07.375
They did.

07:07.458 --> 07:09.708
They said I'm cured, free to go.

07:09.791 --> 07:12.416
Wasn't much truly wrong to start with,

07:12.500 --> 07:13.750
but here we are.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.833
What do you want, Mum?

07:16.416 --> 07:17.958
Just a little help.

07:19.375 --> 07:21.666
Trying to get started fresh.

07:23.125 --> 07:24.291
It's difficult.

07:25.250 --> 07:26.625
And the doctors,

07:26.708 --> 07:28.291
they don't give you anything.

07:28.791 --> 07:30.166
Not even a note.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.625
Nothing to say you're well.

07:33.833 --> 07:35.416
Petie, I'm scared.

07:36.458 --> 07:38.125
If I can't get my own place,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.333
if I can't get my own job, well…

07:42.625 --> 07:44.833
doesn't leave me a lot of options.

07:45.916 --> 07:48.375
And where do I go if not your father?

07:50.916 --> 07:52.916
He sent you, didn't he?

07:53.583 --> 07:55.708
You know, he'd kill you if he could.

07:56.791 --> 07:58.583
For what you did to him.

07:59.166 --> 08:01.000
For what <i>I</i> did to <i>him?</i>

08:01.083 --> 08:02.750
He says it all the time.

08:03.375 --> 08:05.000
For what <i>I</i> did to him?

08:05.916 --> 08:09.541
I just said I didn't want
to have to turn to your father.

08:09.625 --> 08:10.500
After all he did?

08:10.583 --> 08:12.875
Or to the streets. Where do I go?

08:12.958 --> 08:15.125
Did you practice this together, did you?

08:15.666 --> 08:17.250
I mean, where <i>do</i> I go?

08:18.791 --> 08:19.833
To your father?

08:20.916 --> 08:22.041
To the street?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.500
To your boss?

08:29.250 --> 08:30.416
You're shaking me down?

08:32.041 --> 08:35.291
Lord Henry Wingrave, I presume.
[chuckles softly]

08:37.458 --> 08:40.125
Amazing how far you've climbed.

08:41.208 --> 08:42.916
He wound you up,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.041
and now you're shaking me down.

08:45.125 --> 08:49.166
I suppose those juvenile records,
he might not even know.

08:49.250 --> 08:50.958
Sealed, aren't they?

08:52.125 --> 08:55.416
How odd him not knowing.

08:56.791 --> 08:59.750
I don't have any money, Mum.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.916
-Oh, you're not a rich man, Petie?
-No.

09:04.250 --> 09:06.208
Just work for one, do you?

09:07.166 --> 09:10.291
-Forgive me if I misread.
-[jarring crescendo]

09:10.375 --> 09:13.625
[Hannah] Priceless heirlooms.
They're not missing, they're stolen.

09:14.333 --> 09:17.833
My apologies. Missing and stolen
are interchangeable in my speak.

09:18.416 --> 09:21.625
But I'm afraid stolen heirlooms
are the least of it, ma'am.

09:21.708 --> 09:22.875
What do you mean?

09:22.958 --> 09:25.625
Well, Mr. Wingrave asked us
to make a full report,

09:25.708 --> 09:29.458
and, uh, it appears that Mr. Quint
was quite the burglar,

09:30.458 --> 09:32.791
and that, well,
I suppose he's been embezzling.

09:33.416 --> 09:35.000
[scoffs] Of course he has.

09:36.166 --> 09:37.000
[sighs]

09:37.500 --> 09:39.625
Did he say anything at all
to you, Rebecca?

09:39.708 --> 09:42.791
-Even the slightest hint.
-There a reason he'd confide in you?

09:42.875 --> 09:43.791
[Rebecca] Well…

09:43.875 --> 09:44.958
we-we were… I…

09:45.500 --> 09:47.416
-I mean, I-I was--
-Mm. Got it.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.500
So, did he?

09:49.833 --> 09:51.416
I… um…

09:51.500 --> 09:55.458
Rebecca, please. If you know anything,
anything at all, you have to tell him.

09:55.541 --> 09:56.750
No, he…

09:56.833 --> 09:57.666
He said…

09:58.291 --> 10:01.416
[sighs] Well, he mentioned something
about having some money.

10:01.500 --> 10:04.000
-[Hannah] Mm-hm.
-Just a little bit of money, maybe?

10:04.083 --> 10:05.541
Quarter million pounds?

10:05.625 --> 10:06.708
-What?
-No.

10:07.375 --> 10:09.791
-He just said to pack a bag.
-Pack a bag?

10:09.875 --> 10:10.833
Yes.

10:10.916 --> 10:13.000
That we were going to America, together.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.333
Sounds lovely.

10:14.416 --> 10:16.458
All he said was that he had a plan,

10:16.541 --> 10:18.375
and that we would live
in the States together.

10:18.458 --> 10:20.791
-And this all made sense to you?
-I didn't know--

10:20.875 --> 10:22.083
On a butler's wage?

10:22.166 --> 10:25.291
-He isn't a butler.
-[scoffs] Didn't raise any alarms, then?

10:25.875 --> 10:26.916
No.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.666
Not like you're saying it now.

10:28.750 --> 10:31.833
And you're certain he didn't say
where he got this money from?

10:31.916 --> 10:33.708
-No.
-[constable] No, you're not certain?

10:33.791 --> 10:35.416
-Or no, he didn't say?
-He didn't say.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.916
Not even to his girlfriend?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.125
Just pack a bag.
No explanation beyond that?

10:39.208 --> 10:40.041
Nothing at all?

10:41.958 --> 10:43.416
I can't help you.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.541
[scoffs] I'd have thought he'd tell
his girlfriend

10:45.625 --> 10:48.000
-if he gave a damn about her.
-No, he wouldn't--

10:48.083 --> 10:49.958
If he loved her,
I'd think he'd tell her more.

10:50.041 --> 10:52.625
-He wouldn't just--
-Maybe not, since he did leave you behind.

10:52.708 --> 10:54.416
-He wouldn't run away!
-[jarring crescendo]

10:54.500 --> 10:55.625
[crying]

10:57.125 --> 10:59.708
-[breathing shakily]
-[fire crackling]

11:00.375 --> 11:01.458
[Miles] You're right.

11:02.250 --> 11:04.291
Miles, you should be in bed.

11:04.375 --> 11:06.125
[Miles] I couldn't sleep. I don't…

11:06.750 --> 11:09.333
I feel like
I might never sleep again, frankly.

11:09.416 --> 11:12.666
I heard what he said,
the policeman, before he left.

11:13.208 --> 11:14.916
Flora and I listened from the stairs.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.833
It's nothing to worry about, okay?
Go back to bed.

11:17.916 --> 11:19.208
You're right.

11:19.291 --> 11:20.458
He didn't run away.

11:21.916 --> 11:24.750
We told Hannah and the policeman,
but they didn't believe us.

11:24.833 --> 11:26.333
Didn't believe what, Miles?

11:26.416 --> 11:27.625
About the monster.

11:28.291 --> 11:30.958
The monster that took him,
and it was awful,

11:31.041 --> 11:32.166
and we thought he was…

11:38.625 --> 11:39.875
But he's still here,

11:39.958 --> 11:41.875
so it's actually all right.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.000
He told me to tell you not to worry.

11:46.416 --> 11:47.333
So, don't worry.

11:48.583 --> 11:49.708
He's still here.

11:51.875 --> 11:52.708
Miles?

11:53.875 --> 11:55.333
[Rebecca pants]

11:55.958 --> 11:57.041
-Miles!
-[jarring thud]

11:57.875 --> 12:00.875
[Hannah] Why don't you use a mixer?
Save you some elbow grease.

12:00.958 --> 12:03.291
[Owen] A mixer? Do I look like an amateur?

12:03.375 --> 12:06.083
A mixer damages the gluten molecules,
Hannah, my dear.

12:06.166 --> 12:07.500
[Hannah] Oh, would it?

12:07.583 --> 12:10.666
-Not the gluten molecules.
-[Owen] Baking is just chemistry.

12:10.750 --> 12:13.375
[Hannah] Oh, well, so is mopping floors.

12:13.458 --> 12:17.000
One part bleach, two parts water,
and lots of lovely washing-up liquid

12:17.083 --> 12:18.666
for the lemon scent, of course.

12:19.375 --> 12:21.541
Seriously, just throw it
in a bloody mixer.

12:21.625 --> 12:22.458
[Owen sighs]

12:23.250 --> 12:24.083
What is that?

12:26.000 --> 12:26.833
Dough.

12:27.375 --> 12:28.458
Uncooked dough?

12:29.666 --> 12:31.500
Brilliant, I'm starving.

12:32.041 --> 12:34.333
Well, can't rush genius, Jamie.

12:34.416 --> 12:37.583
See, a mixer would damage
the gluten molecules, and we mustn't.

12:37.666 --> 12:41.250
God help us all if those gluten molecules
aren't tippety-top.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.166
You having one of Owen's
cooking physics classes again?

12:47.250 --> 12:48.875
Oh, yes, a fine lecture.

12:48.958 --> 12:50.333
It's chemistry.

12:50.416 --> 12:52.375
-Mm.
-[Jamie] Certainly is.

12:52.458 --> 12:53.458
What's that?

12:54.708 --> 12:56.000
Hi, Rebecca, love.

12:56.583 --> 12:59.833
Lunch is gonna be late today.
Something about gluten atoms.

12:59.916 --> 13:01.708
I'll let the children know.

13:01.791 --> 13:04.166
Why don't you stay?
Sit with us and have a brew?

13:04.250 --> 13:06.041
The kettle's still warm.

13:06.125 --> 13:08.708
[Owen] Uh, kids can handle 15 minutes
by themselves.

13:10.291 --> 13:12.583
[Rebecca] Um…
I'm not thirsty, thanks.

13:13.291 --> 13:16.750
I think I'm going to get some air.
Feels quite warm today, doesn't it?

13:19.416 --> 13:21.041
[footsteps receding]

13:21.125 --> 13:23.583
-[Owen sniffs]
-[melancholy music playing]

13:24.583 --> 13:26.583
[birds chirping]

14:09.458 --> 14:10.541
How you doing, chick?

14:12.166 --> 14:13.666
Here to gloat a little, Jamie?

14:14.541 --> 14:16.250
Tell me you were right about him.

14:16.750 --> 14:19.000
Not just a shite but a thief,
it turns out.

14:19.708 --> 14:21.166
Is that what we're doing here, is it?

14:21.875 --> 14:23.916
Not here to talk about him at all.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.583
Someone should point out
that this is a moment for you.

14:28.583 --> 14:32.000
A moment you have been waiting,
and waiting, and waiting for.

14:32.083 --> 14:35.500
And it is finally here,
and you're too busy moping to even see it.

14:37.083 --> 14:38.791
I thought I should speak to that.

14:39.291 --> 14:41.125
Cause I'd want someone
to do the same for me.

14:41.208 --> 14:43.000
What are you talking about?

14:43.083 --> 14:44.958
Go and speak to our phantom boss.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.250
Tell him you want that pupilage
you talked about.

14:49.291 --> 14:50.166
All this drama?

14:50.750 --> 14:52.708
Quint? The imposition of it all?

14:53.416 --> 14:55.750
He could do right by you, right now.

14:56.333 --> 14:58.416
Get you back on your barrister track.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.125
Get you back
to whatever goal it was you had

15:01.208 --> 15:03.333
before you even knew
what a Peter Quint was.

15:03.416 --> 15:04.250
Well, that's…

15:05.583 --> 15:07.375
Sorry to see you hurt so much.

15:08.750 --> 15:09.916
You don't deserve it.

15:10.916 --> 15:12.166
And I'm sorry to see it.

15:13.083 --> 15:17.000
And if there is anything at all
that I can do to help,

15:17.875 --> 15:18.708
please tell me.

15:19.916 --> 15:21.041
I'd be happy to do so.

15:23.041 --> 15:23.875
Thank you.

15:37.750 --> 15:38.583
[Rebecca sighs]

15:40.458 --> 15:42.458
[insects chirping softly]

15:47.791 --> 15:49.125
[sighs] Hm.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.083
Becs.

16:02.625 --> 16:03.500
What…

16:05.875 --> 16:08.250
-Where the hell have you been?
-Quiet, please.

16:09.166 --> 16:11.500
You said you were coming back.
You said to pack a bag!

16:11.583 --> 16:14.583
-They're gonna hear you, please.
-Good! They should hear me.

16:14.666 --> 16:16.625
They should call the police
because you stole.

16:16.708 --> 16:19.041
-I know. I just--
-You stole from them, and I…

16:19.125 --> 16:22.333
My God, I said I would come away with you,
and you made me an accomplice.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.041
You would have turned me
into a criminal, too,

16:25.125 --> 16:26.875
and I would have been fucking clueless.

16:26.958 --> 16:28.458
-It's not like that.
-You left.

16:28.541 --> 16:30.250
-I didn't.
-Not even a note.

16:30.333 --> 16:31.458
-I never-- Mm.
-Never what?

16:31.541 --> 16:32.708
You never loved me.

16:33.500 --> 16:36.458
-Y-- You never told me the truth.
-No, I never left you.

16:38.250 --> 16:39.083
I was here,

16:39.166 --> 16:40.416
this whole time,

16:40.916 --> 16:42.500
but I-- I couldn't…

16:42.583 --> 16:43.500
[breathing deeply]

16:44.625 --> 16:46.625
You couldn't see me, not right away.

16:46.708 --> 16:48.750
I had to figure out a way to make it so…

16:51.041 --> 16:52.375
So that you could see me.

16:52.458 --> 16:54.458
Oh, you'll need to do better than that.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.916
-Much better than that.
-Becs, don't come…

16:58.000 --> 16:59.208
[scoffs] What is it?

16:59.708 --> 17:00.958
-Afraid I'll hit you?
-No.

17:01.041 --> 17:02.583
-You don't think you deserve it?
-No.

17:02.666 --> 17:04.875
-Because you do, Peter--
-Please, just listen!

17:04.958 --> 17:07.000
Just for one moment.

17:07.083 --> 17:08.166
[Peter panting]

17:09.250 --> 17:11.500
I never left you, Becs.

17:11.583 --> 17:12.750
I won't.

17:13.958 --> 17:17.875
I wouldn't leave without you,
and I-I won't leave without you now.

17:17.958 --> 17:19.416
That's why I'm here.

17:20.500 --> 17:21.375
I'm sorry.

17:23.708 --> 17:25.500
I'm sorry we were apart, uh…

17:26.250 --> 17:28.125
however long that was, I don't…

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
I don't even know
how long that was that…

17:31.500 --> 17:32.541
What does that mean?

17:34.416 --> 17:35.916
This is going to upset you.

17:36.000 --> 17:36.875
Upset?

17:37.791 --> 17:40.291
Oh, I'm much more than just upset.

17:40.375 --> 17:41.208
Please, just…

17:41.291 --> 17:43.041
hold out your hand.

17:44.166 --> 17:45.000
What?

17:45.666 --> 17:46.500
Why?

17:46.583 --> 17:48.083
Just hold out your hand.

17:49.916 --> 17:53.166
[Peter takes deep breath and sighs]

17:57.666 --> 17:58.708
And please…

18:00.333 --> 18:01.541
Please think…

18:02.250 --> 18:03.708
What's the one thing…

18:05.166 --> 18:06.375
the only thing…

18:07.833 --> 18:09.500
that would ever keep me from you?

18:14.125 --> 18:15.791
[melancholy music playing]

18:17.458 --> 18:18.375
[swoosh]

18:20.500 --> 18:21.500
[Rebecca gasping]

18:26.125 --> 18:26.958
[whispers] I…

18:29.000 --> 18:30.708
[Miles] May we be excused, Miss Jessel?

18:35.000 --> 18:35.875
Miss Jessel?

18:37.583 --> 18:38.416
[Hannah] Rebecca?

18:41.416 --> 18:42.625
Are you still down here?

18:43.375 --> 18:44.333
Are you all right?

18:46.291 --> 18:48.291
Yes, um, I suppose.

18:48.875 --> 18:51.333
-The children are asleep.
-Oh, I know. I know.

18:52.958 --> 18:53.958
[Hannah sighs]

18:54.666 --> 18:56.125
I'm worried for you, love.

18:56.833 --> 18:58.291
I-- I'm fine.

18:59.458 --> 19:00.291
[Hannah] Hm.

19:04.375 --> 19:05.208
Fractions, eh?

19:05.291 --> 19:06.208
[chuckles]

19:07.333 --> 19:08.458
Oh, yes.

19:09.250 --> 19:12.125
[exhales]
Hated those when I was a little girl.

19:13.250 --> 19:16.666
-Flora, um… She's quite good at them.
-[Hannah] Oh.

19:19.458 --> 19:20.541
You know, uh…

19:21.333 --> 19:24.333
a friend once told me something
about fractions, and…

19:24.916 --> 19:26.333
grieving her breakup.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.041
The maths of it.

19:28.541 --> 19:30.375
How long it takes to grieve it.

19:31.333 --> 19:32.833
Right, and what was that?

19:33.625 --> 19:35.750
They said it's the length
of a relationship, halved.

19:36.333 --> 19:37.333
-Halved?
-Mm.

19:37.416 --> 19:38.375
To get over it.

19:38.875 --> 19:42.000
The length of a relationship, halved,
which for you, well it…

19:42.083 --> 19:44.500
it really isn't that long now, is it?

19:46.166 --> 19:48.416
Well, not everything has a half-life,

19:49.250 --> 19:50.083
does it?

19:50.916 --> 19:52.916
[clock ticking quietly]

19:54.916 --> 19:57.375
Quite right. [sighs]

20:32.708 --> 20:33.791
[Rebecca, whispering] Peter.

20:37.333 --> 20:38.166
[louder] Peter?

20:45.208 --> 20:48.291
Gosh, it's been all I can do all day
not to just come up here.

20:49.625 --> 20:52.416
Knowing you're up here
while I'm down there, it's just torture.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.375
I know. I know.

20:56.083 --> 20:57.500
I can see you in the classroom.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.291
Couldn't risk it, you know,
'cause of the kids.

21:03.000 --> 21:03.958
I've been thinking.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.000
What if… [sighs]

21:10.416 --> 21:11.875
What if we still did it?

21:13.666 --> 21:14.625
Did what? [chuckles]

21:15.958 --> 21:17.125
Went to America.

21:18.208 --> 21:19.666
I know, just…

21:20.375 --> 21:21.208
we do it anyway,

21:21.291 --> 21:24.708
and… and people can think I'm some
batty old witch who talks to thin air,

21:24.791 --> 21:27.416
-but at least we'd be together.
-[chuckles]

21:31.666 --> 21:32.875
I can't leave Bly.

21:34.958 --> 21:36.875
I can't get past the end of the drive.

21:37.875 --> 21:40.625
I walk and I run, and the moment…

21:42.250 --> 21:44.750
[sighs] The moment I reach
the edge of the property,

21:44.833 --> 21:46.083
I'm right back here.

21:47.333 --> 21:49.333
Inside. Right on the spot where it…

21:51.500 --> 21:52.583
Will you tell me now?

21:54.083 --> 21:55.041
How it happened?

21:58.458 --> 21:59.291
No.

22:00.083 --> 22:02.916
[ghostly whooshing]

22:05.125 --> 22:06.666
You're right there.

22:08.833 --> 22:11.041
You're right there,
and I can't even touch you.

22:11.666 --> 22:14.833
[crying] I can't smell you,
I can't feel you. No, it's not fair!

22:14.916 --> 22:17.208
-Shh.
-It's not fucking fair! [sobbing]

22:17.291 --> 22:19.583
-You're here. I can hear you--
-Shh! You've got to be--

22:19.666 --> 22:21.625
-[Rebecca] Quiet, Becs!
-[ominous crash]

22:22.583 --> 22:24.583
[music box playing "O Willow Waly"]

22:27.458 --> 22:28.291
Becs?

22:32.625 --> 22:33.458
Becs?

22:46.125 --> 22:47.250
[Rebecca pants]

22:52.125 --> 22:54.125
[gasping]

22:57.541 --> 22:59.000
[jarring crescendo]

22:59.083 --> 23:00.250
[Rebecca breathes heavily]

23:00.333 --> 23:01.375
-Please.
-Peter?

23:01.458 --> 23:03.041
-Oh, hell.
-What?

23:03.541 --> 23:05.416
Wh-Where was I? What just happened?

23:05.500 --> 23:06.583
I don't… I don't know.

23:06.666 --> 23:07.666
[knocking on door]

23:07.750 --> 23:08.916
What the hell?

23:09.000 --> 23:10.666
What is that? Can you hear that?

23:10.750 --> 23:12.333
[Rebecca] I-I was…

23:12.416 --> 23:14.541
-All of a sudden, I-I was somewhere else.
-[pounding]

23:14.625 --> 23:16.125
[Peter] What's that knocking?

23:16.208 --> 23:17.666
What did you do to me?

23:17.750 --> 23:18.708
What is that?

23:18.791 --> 23:20.416
[pounding grows louder]

23:21.375 --> 23:22.916
[jarring crescendo]

23:24.041 --> 23:24.916
Oh, no.

23:25.916 --> 23:27.250
That's what you say to me?

23:28.208 --> 23:29.791
You're here, again.

23:29.875 --> 23:31.416
And look at this.

23:32.833 --> 23:33.833
Look at you.

23:34.458 --> 23:36.166
-Look at this.
-No. No, enough.

23:36.791 --> 23:37.625
Enough.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.125
[breathing heavily]

23:39.208 --> 23:40.041
Back.

23:41.750 --> 23:43.458
Back. I have to go back.

23:43.541 --> 23:44.958
Have to go back.

23:45.041 --> 23:46.458
Have to go back.

23:48.166 --> 23:49.708
[jarring crescendo]

23:49.791 --> 23:51.791
[music fades]

23:53.500 --> 23:54.833
[footsteps approaching]

23:55.750 --> 23:57.625
Hey, where have you been hiding?

23:58.166 --> 23:59.000
Hiding?

24:00.000 --> 24:02.583
You look better of late.
Did you speak to Henry?

24:03.083 --> 24:03.916
Henry?

24:04.916 --> 24:07.666
About working for him in London,
like we talked about.

24:09.250 --> 24:11.208
How could I forget? Oh, yes.

24:12.208 --> 24:13.166
I called him.

24:14.041 --> 24:16.666
Thought you said you were gonna visit,
do it in person.

24:16.750 --> 24:17.958
I changed my mind.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.375
-Well?
-Well, what?

24:20.458 --> 24:21.583
Well, what did he say?

24:22.166 --> 24:23.750
Uh, just…

24:24.333 --> 24:25.958
that he'll consider.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.333
Consider?

24:29.041 --> 24:30.166
For real?

24:31.791 --> 24:32.625
Twat.

24:33.125 --> 24:34.250
He owes it to you.

24:38.208 --> 24:39.166
Are you okay?

24:40.500 --> 24:41.333
Yeah.

24:43.833 --> 24:45.000
[door closes]

24:45.958 --> 24:47.041

[grunts]

25:20.375 --> 25:22.375
[somber music playing]

25:28.250 --> 25:29.291
It didn't work.

25:30.958 --> 25:31.791
No.

25:39.333 --> 25:40.958
-[Hannah] Wait.
-[Flora giggles]

25:41.041 --> 25:44.166
-[indistinct chatter<i> </i>and laughter]

25:48.041 --> 25:50.291
[storyteller]
<i>Peter had not been back to find her.</i>

25:52.250 --> 25:54.250
<i>He had left her at the boundary of Bly.</i>

25:57.666 --> 25:59.125
[Flora] Miles, stop it!

25:59.625 --> 26:02.166
[storyteller] <i>The boundary impossible</i>

26:02.250 --> 26:03.375
[Flora] Miss Jessel!

26:03.458 --> 26:04.291
Miles, stop!

26:04.375 --> 26:08.125
[storyteller] <i>And though she didn't</i>
<i>much like losing time being tucked away,</i>

26:09.458 --> 26:11.083
<i>at least she had company there.</i>

26:11.791 --> 26:12.916
<i>His company.</i>

26:22.333 --> 26:23.250
Peter?

26:30.333 --> 26:31.166
Peter.

26:54.916 --> 26:56.041
[lamp switch clicks]

26:59.125 --> 27:00.041
[whispering] Becs.

27:01.375 --> 27:03.000
Where the hell have you been?

27:03.083 --> 27:05.625
-It's been almost a week.
-[in normal voice] I'm sorry, I…

27:07.833 --> 27:09.666
I've been learning. I've been e--

27:10.458 --> 27:11.708
exploring.

27:11.791 --> 27:12.833
What? Where?

27:12.916 --> 27:14.833
Here, at-at Bly.

27:15.541 --> 27:17.541
I've seen things. I've seen, um…

27:19.708 --> 27:20.541
You trust me?

27:22.666 --> 27:25.750
I need you to trust me,
because I have a plan.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.041
A plan that'll let us be together again.

27:31.333 --> 27:32.583
And touch each other,

27:32.666 --> 27:34.541
and… and-and taste each other.

27:39.333 --> 27:40.166
So, um…

27:42.083 --> 27:44.166
these little…

27:44.250 --> 27:45.916
little hiccups when I'm inside--

27:46.000 --> 27:49.083
I don't know if I like those,
being pushed away into a memory.

27:49.166 --> 27:51.625
No, I know. I don't like them, either.
You always push me--

27:51.708 --> 27:53.125
-Yeah, but I don't try to.
-I know.

27:53.208 --> 27:54.625
But that's the thing, it's…

27:55.208 --> 27:56.333
It's temporary.

27:56.833 --> 27:57.875
It's just a blip.

27:58.958 --> 28:00.666
But what if there was another way?

28:02.083 --> 28:02.916
A way…

28:04.000 --> 28:06.416
for us to be truly together,

28:06.500 --> 28:08.166
fully together?

28:08.708 --> 28:11.041
-How?
-Well, that's the thing. [chuckles]

28:11.666 --> 28:13.791
It's like those other times, like those…

28:14.291 --> 28:17.333
little blips,
but I think if-if it works, that…

28:20.083 --> 28:21.916
If it works, it could last forever.

28:23.125 --> 28:24.458
It would be the two of us…

28:24.958 --> 28:26.708
sharing a life.

28:26.791 --> 28:28.875
I don't understand, but how?

28:29.416 --> 28:30.458
Well, it's simple.

28:31.208 --> 28:33.958
I think a lot simpler than you think, but…

28:35.083 --> 28:36.416
It just boils down to you.

28:37.833 --> 28:38.875
It's up to you.

28:40.791 --> 28:42.000
That's why those…

28:42.541 --> 28:44.250
little blips never take.

28:44.333 --> 28:46.458
That's why
I keep getting pushed out, because…

28:47.416 --> 28:49.208
Because you didn't invite me in.

28:50.541 --> 28:53.416
You just need to decide that it's forever.

28:54.333 --> 28:55.166
Permanent.

28:56.458 --> 28:57.541
Uh-- I…

28:57.625 --> 28:59.125
H-How would I even…

28:59.666 --> 29:01.750
-What--
-I-I don't know, I…

29:02.583 --> 29:04.250
I don't know e-exactly, but…

29:04.333 --> 29:06.208
But I think it's just, well…

29:07.083 --> 29:08.375
I think it's just you…

29:09.416 --> 29:10.333
and me…

29:12.125 --> 29:13.333
b-becoming us.

29:18.416 --> 29:19.250
It's you.

29:20.000 --> 29:20.875
It's me.

29:22.750 --> 29:24.541
You'll take care of me, yes?

29:24.625 --> 29:25.500
Of course.

29:26.125 --> 29:27.291
And we'll be together?

29:27.791 --> 29:30.166
We'll share it all, everything. Equals.

29:32.416 --> 29:33.250
I promise.

29:40.166 --> 29:41.333
I love you, Peter.

29:43.375 --> 29:44.833
I love you, Becs.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.041
[sighs shakily]

29:54.166 --> 29:55.125
[Rebecca] It's you.

29:56.291 --> 29:57.125
It's me.

30:00.041 --> 30:01.083
It's us.

[melancholy music playing]

31:05.583 --> 31:06.416
I'm…

31:07.750 --> 31:09.416
I'm tucked away again, aren't I?

31:12.666 --> 31:13.583
-Yes.
-I…

31:14.708 --> 31:16.791
I-I thought-- I thought we'd be together.

31:19.666 --> 31:20.625
But we are.

What are you--

[gasps] Fuck.

34:58.916 --> 35:00.000
Okay.

You're okay.

[Peter] You know, fur like that,

35:26.208 --> 35:27.875
you have to feel it on your skin.

35:28.541 --> 35:29.375
You have to.

35:29.958 --> 35:30.875
Once in your life.

35:31.833 --> 35:33.041
There's nothing like it.

35:38.875 --> 35:40.125
[Rebecca] No, no.

35:40.875 --> 35:42.833
Not this one.
Not this one, please.

35:51.041 --> 35:53.208
Please, not this. Not this memory.

35:54.875 --> 35:56.583
It's not a memory, Becs. I…

35:57.833 --> 35:59.875
I just thought it would make you happy.

36:01.666 --> 36:02.708
[Rebecca] But it was.

36:10.333 --> 36:11.166
I know.

36:15.416 --> 36:17.583
-I know.
-[Rebecca] Because you hid.

36:19.583 --> 36:20.625
You…

36:20.708 --> 36:23.416
Y-You-- You hid from me, a-after the lake.

36:23.916 --> 36:26.416
You hid,
and-and I just keep coming back here.

36:49.625 --> 36:51.083
-you just left.
-So beautiful.

36:52.208 --> 36:54.208
[sobbing] You just left me to do it alone.

36:56.458 --> 36:57.708
This isn't what you said.

36:58.666 --> 37:00.500
It's not what I agreed. I…

37:02.250 --> 37:03.291
I-I didn't…

37:04.500 --> 37:05.541
I didn't agree.

-Beautiful.

[shutter clicks]

-Beautiful.

37:12.583 --> 37:14.666
[melancholy music playing]

37:25.708 --> 37:26.583
I had to.

37:29.375 --> 37:30.208
[Rebecca] What?

37:31.875 --> 37:33.375
[Peter] I'm so sorry.

37:34.583 --> 37:36.250
But I had to, so that…

37:38.000 --> 37:39.750
Well, so that we could be together.

37:40.458 --> 37:42.041
Fucking son of a bitch!

37:42.708 --> 37:45.291
[screaming] You fucking lied!
You're a fucking liar!

37:45.375 --> 37:46.708
-I had to!
-[Rebecca] No!

37:47.500 --> 37:49.625
-I'm sorry, but I had to.
-[Rebecca sobs]

37:51.333 --> 37:52.958
And you'll have to, too.

-Look, you'll understand.
-[knocking on door]

[knocking]

[sniffles]

38:04.916 --> 38:06.833
When you-- When you meet the others.

38:06.916 --> 38:08.833
When you see
what happens to us here, Becs.

38:08.916 --> 38:10.500
-[pounding on door]
-Please.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.333
[pounding continues]

38:13.416 --> 38:16.416
Now, I-I-I know,
I know that there's a way out.

38:17.041 --> 38:18.833
You proved that. We've proved that

38:18.916 --> 38:20.250
-there's a way for--
-[pounding]

38:20.333 --> 38:21.166
How?

38:21.666 --> 38:23.791
-Please, not now.
-How?

38:23.875 --> 38:24.833
Not now.

38:25.750 --> 38:27.625
How? How do I get out?

38:27.708 --> 38:29.833
-I'm gonna show you. I'm--
-[pounding on door]

38:29.916 --> 38:32.250
Damn it, I was right in the middle…

[breathing heavily]

38:42.708 --> 38:43.541
No.

38:43.625 --> 38:44.958
And look at this.

38:47.500 --> 38:48.375
Look at you.

38:48.458 --> 38:50.708
Again, we have to do this?

38:53.250 --> 38:56.750
I was in the middle of something,
something important.

38:56.833 --> 38:58.291
I doubt that.

39:06.208 --> 39:07.333
You know the others?

39:09.541 --> 39:11.791
Well, they seem to go to lots places,
don't they?

39:12.583 --> 39:13.750
Becs, the kids.

39:14.250 --> 39:17.666
They get to hop around
into the warmest little memories,

39:17.750 --> 39:20.250
the nicest little moments.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.083
And I always end up here.

39:24.166 --> 39:25.833
Is that so bad?

39:25.916 --> 39:27.000
It's hell.

39:29.875 --> 39:31.416
It's like I'm in hell.

39:32.083 --> 39:35.583
Well, where else would you go?

39:36.166 --> 39:37.291
At first, I thought…

39:37.375 --> 39:39.375
[pensive music playing softly]

39:40.166 --> 39:42.541
this-this isn't so bad. I mean, it…

39:44.666 --> 39:45.666
could've been worse.

39:46.666 --> 39:48.583
I mean, I could be back there at home,

39:49.416 --> 39:50.250
with Dad.

39:52.916 --> 39:55.416
I could've been tucked away
in one of those nights.

39:56.083 --> 39:59.916
But then I started to realize
why this was worse than that.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.958
Why this was hell.

40:04.708 --> 40:06.833
Because I-- I was a kid back then.

40:09.291 --> 40:12.083
I didn't understand
what was happening to me.

40:12.166 --> 40:13.958
I didn't know what it meant, and…

40:15.875 --> 40:16.958
And you were there.

40:18.625 --> 40:21.458
You were there
to tell me that it was okay.

40:22.208 --> 40:23.833
That what he was doing…

40:24.458 --> 40:25.333
was okay.

40:26.208 --> 40:27.666
You said I was being silly.

40:29.375 --> 40:30.458
That's what you said.

40:31.166 --> 40:33.166
But I was innocent, wasn't I?

40:35.500 --> 40:37.208
I didn't know any better.

40:40.041 --> 40:41.333
But here, this time…

40:42.375 --> 40:43.833
Well, I know better, don't I?

40:43.916 --> 40:48.083
This time, seeing you
in that fucking doorway…

40:49.708 --> 40:53.458
I've thought about every kid
that ever spent the night.

40:55.291 --> 40:59.333
And how you knew what you knew,

40:59.416 --> 41:01.166
and you didn't stop him.

41:03.041 --> 41:05.750
[sobbing breaths]

41:06.375 --> 41:08.000
Why didn't you stop him?

41:09.500 --> 41:12.166
He'd kill you if he knew where you were.

41:13.250 --> 41:15.041
<i>You </i>killed me, Mum.

41:17.666 --> 41:20.916
You killed me asking me to do this. I…

41:22.291 --> 41:24.791
I did what you wanted.

41:27.083 --> 41:27.958
And it killed me.

41:29.041 --> 41:30.416
I hope you know that,

41:30.958 --> 41:31.958
late at night,

41:32.041 --> 41:34.000
that you killed your own son.

41:35.041 --> 41:38.333
Honey, I don't even know that you're dead.

41:38.833 --> 41:40.125
But I was…

41:41.750 --> 41:43.375
I was-- I was right…

41:45.041 --> 41:46.833
in the middle…

41:46.916 --> 41:48.000
of something.

41:48.708 --> 41:50.416
[Dani groaning]

41:51.458 --> 41:53.791
Thank you. [sobbing] Thank you.

41:53.875 --> 41:55.541
Flora? Flora, hurry.

41:56.375 --> 41:57.708
-Please, hurry.
-[unsettling boom]

41:57.791 --> 41:58.791
Please, keep going.

41:59.250 --> 42:00.375
-[Peter] Stop it.
-Please.

42:00.458 --> 42:03.333
-[Peter yelling] Stop right--
-There! Stop it, Flora.

42:03.416 --> 42:06.083
-No, no, no. [muffled cries]
-She has to stay where she is.

42:06.166 --> 42:07.250
Sorry! Sorry!

42:09.791 --> 42:10.708
-[Dani] Flora.
-Sorry.

42:10.791 --> 42:11.625
Is it?

42:12.291 --> 42:15.416
The minute I'm gone,
you're spinning these kids up.

42:15.500 --> 42:17.708
-You're taking--
-Advantage of their good intentions!

42:17.791 --> 42:19.500
-[gasping breaths]
-Shameful.

42:20.958 --> 42:22.500
You're supposed to warn me.

42:22.583 --> 42:25.708
-I'm sorry, I had to.
-I don't like it when you don't warn me.

42:25.791 --> 42:27.166
I know. I'm sorry, okay?

42:27.250 --> 42:30.750
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
It won't be like that anymore, okay?

42:30.833 --> 42:32.583
-I promise.
-[Dani sobbing softly]

42:32.666 --> 42:34.083
I'll explain, but it won't…

42:34.916 --> 42:35.750
[Rebecca] Peter?

42:36.833 --> 42:38.250
How long was I…

42:38.333 --> 42:39.375
Oh, you're back.

42:40.250 --> 42:41.708
-Are you okay?
-[Dani moaning]

42:42.250 --> 42:43.250
Oh, you're back.

42:43.833 --> 42:44.791
I'm sorry.

42:44.875 --> 42:47.375
No. No, no, no, it's okay.

42:47.458 --> 42:48.916
It's okay. I slipped away, too.

42:50.708 --> 42:51.750
But we're back now.

42:52.541 --> 42:53.416
We're back.

42:54.333 --> 42:55.458
And we're almost done.

42:58.708 --> 43:00.208
We have to finish it now.

43:00.291 --> 43:03.083
-No, no, but it's too soon.
-No, but it's right.

43:03.541 --> 43:04.375
It's right.

43:05.291 --> 43:06.541
A little longer, we…

43:07.083 --> 43:08.958
We should give them a little longer.

43:09.041 --> 43:09.958
We're out of time.

43:12.458 --> 43:14.333
She'll take them. We're out of time.

43:14.416 --> 43:16.166
[Miles] What are you talking about?

43:18.166 --> 43:19.000
Well…

43:22.208 --> 43:25.166
it's what we've been talking about
this whole time.

43:25.250 --> 43:26.125
That…

43:26.958 --> 43:28.916
-special thing, that…
-[Dani gasping]

43:29.000 --> 43:31.291
…one last thing
we've been asking you kids.

43:31.375 --> 43:32.791
The forever house.

43:32.875 --> 43:33.958
[Peter] That's right.

43:34.666 --> 43:35.750
The forever house.

43:36.750 --> 43:38.125
It's time?

43:38.208 --> 43:39.666
-It is.
-["O Willow Waly" playing]

43:39.750 --> 43:42.083
But why can't we just keep it
the way it is?

43:42.166 --> 43:44.666
Those… Those little hiccups
aren't so bad.

43:44.750 --> 43:45.875
I know, but it's just…

43:47.250 --> 43:49.541
Well, Miss Jessel and I,

43:50.458 --> 43:52.833
we just need a little more from you both.

43:53.583 --> 43:56.625
It's like what we've talked about,
remember?

43:56.708 --> 44:00.500
That special present
that will let Miss Jessel and I, well…

44:01.416 --> 44:02.875
Well, let us be your friends.

44:03.458 --> 44:05.333
Your best friends, forever.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.375
And it's gonna save us.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.375
It's gonna save us from…

44:11.250 --> 44:12.291
well, you know what.

44:12.875 --> 44:14.791
But I-I thought you said that--

44:14.875 --> 44:16.791
I-I know what I said, Miles.

44:16.875 --> 44:19.500
But we have to finish it now, okay?

44:19.583 --> 44:20.625
We have to.

44:20.708 --> 44:21.541
[Rebecca] Peter.

44:22.041 --> 44:23.958
Maybe we can wait until…

44:25.416 --> 44:27.333
Wait until what, Becs?

44:29.375 --> 44:30.750
What? Until we fade away?

44:31.458 --> 44:32.375
Until we look…

44:33.708 --> 44:34.791
-Like this?
-[woman gasps]

44:35.666 --> 44:36.750
[Dani yells]

44:37.333 --> 44:41.541
'Cause that's what's gonna happen, Becs.
This is what will happen, Miles and Flora.

44:42.291 --> 44:43.958
You don't want that
to happen to us, do you?

44:44.708 --> 44:45.833
To Miss Jessel? To me?

44:46.333 --> 44:48.083
No. No, of course not.

44:48.166 --> 44:51.666
Because this is what happens
to everyone who dies here at Bly.

44:51.750 --> 44:53.458
-[Dani screams]
-[Miles] It's fine.

44:54.958 --> 44:56.750
-[woman cries out]
-[thud]

44:56.833 --> 44:58.041
But not with your help.

45:02.541 --> 45:03.375
[Peter] You…

45:06.041 --> 45:07.958
You both can save us.

45:09.958 --> 45:14.083
You're gonna help us break out
with that game we've talked about so much.

45:15.333 --> 45:16.208
Jailbreak?

45:16.291 --> 45:17.833
That's right, jailbreak.

45:18.875 --> 45:21.333
I'm still not sure this is a good idea.

45:21.416 --> 45:22.250
[Dani sobbing]

45:22.833 --> 45:23.833
Miss Jessel,

45:24.458 --> 45:27.000
do you promise this is a good idea?

45:27.083 --> 45:29.041
Flora, I…

45:29.125 --> 45:31.083
[gentle piano music playing]

45:32.375 --> 45:34.833
Look, I know it's scary, but…

45:35.750 --> 45:36.791
we're out of time.

45:37.291 --> 45:40.291
And so, Miles, I need your help,

45:40.375 --> 45:42.708
and Miss Jessel needs you, Flora.

45:42.791 --> 45:43.750
Isn't that right?

45:49.041 --> 45:49.875
It's easy.

45:50.625 --> 45:51.708
You just have to…

45:53.250 --> 45:55.541
think as hard as you can.

45:56.125 --> 45:57.250
Think about you,

45:57.750 --> 45:58.625
and me,

45:59.125 --> 46:00.833
and then think us.

46:00.916 --> 46:04.916
As hard as you can, just think… us.

46:05.583 --> 46:08.166
-[Dani crying]
-[Peter] You have nothing to worry about.

46:08.833 --> 46:11.125
Nothing at all,
'cause you're gonna be tucked away.

46:11.208 --> 46:12.958
In the forever house, just like we said.

46:13.541 --> 46:15.666
-With Mum and Dad?
-That's right.

46:15.750 --> 46:17.291
With your loving Mum and Dad.

46:17.916 --> 46:19.000
[Flora] You promise?

46:19.083 --> 46:23.583
When we get tucked away,
we'll be tucked away with Mummy and Daddy?

46:24.291 --> 46:25.208
That's right.

46:26.958 --> 46:28.875
[Flora] We'll be with Mummy and Daddy,

46:28.958 --> 46:31.500
and they won't fade, right?

46:32.125 --> 46:33.500
That won't happen to them.

46:34.250 --> 46:36.333
Because they died somewhere else.

46:36.916 --> 46:39.875
They'll keep their faces, and so will you.

46:40.416 --> 46:41.625
And it will be happy.

46:42.125 --> 46:44.625
And then everyone will be just…

46:46.000 --> 46:46.916
You promise?

46:47.000 --> 46:48.500
We promise.

46:49.583 --> 46:50.708
Now, both of you,

46:51.291 --> 46:53.166
as hard as you can, think…

46:53.250 --> 46:54.833
[breathing deeply]

46:56.750 --> 46:57.583
Flora…

46:58.916 --> 47:02.833
look at Miss Jessel,
and, Miles, look at me, and think us.

47:04.458 --> 47:06.250
-[Dani moans]
-What about Miss Clayton?

47:06.333 --> 47:08.291
-What will happen to her?
-Nothing bad.

47:08.375 --> 47:09.958
Nothing bad, I promise you that.

47:10.041 --> 47:13.291
See, Miss Clayton?
There's nothing to worry about.

47:13.375 --> 47:16.125
I'm going to the forever house
with my mum,

47:16.625 --> 47:18.333
and it's going to be just…

47:18.875 --> 47:20.083
perfectly splendid.

47:20.166 --> 47:21.375
[muffled] No!

47:21.458 --> 47:22.458
Yeah, that's right.

47:24.041 --> 47:26.416
-Go and see Miss Jessel.
-[Dani crying out]

47:28.291 --> 47:29.583
I still don't feel--

47:29.666 --> 47:31.541
No, no more pain.

47:32.250 --> 47:35.083
No more sadness, ever, ever again.

47:36.583 --> 47:39.708
No more school, no more bullies.

47:40.375 --> 47:41.750
I'm gonna take all of that.

47:43.083 --> 47:44.250
I'm gonna take it all.

47:44.958 --> 47:48.250
Nothing sad will ever touch you,
ever again.

47:51.208 --> 47:53.708
You just get your mum and your dad…

47:55.375 --> 47:56.583
and a safe place.

47:57.083 --> 47:59.958
With two people who love you so much.

48:01.125 --> 48:02.125
So much.

48:03.291 --> 48:06.000
That makes you
the luckiest man in the world.

48:08.416 --> 48:09.916
The richest person.

48:11.166 --> 48:13.166
I wi-- I wish…

48:13.708 --> 48:15.791
I wish I could be that rich.

48:22.166 --> 48:23.583
So, have pity on me.

48:24.166 --> 48:26.291
[Dani panting and sobbing]

48:27.125 --> 48:28.333
Go on, be a good lad.

48:30.583 --> 48:32.333
[Dani yelling] No! No!

48:32.416 --> 48:33.541
It's you.

48:34.458 --> 48:36.041
-[Dani whimpering]
-It's me.

48:39.583 --> 48:40.416
It's us.

48:43.750 --> 48:45.125
-[screams]
-[thud]

48:45.208 --> 48:46.500
No!

[Dani screaming]

48:49.375 --> 48:50.666
[Dani crying]

48:50.750 --> 48:52.166
-No!
-It's us.

48:52.833 --> 48:54.000
[thud]

48:54.083 --> 48:56.208
[Dani screaming] No! No!

48:56.291 --> 48:57.666
[sobbing]

49:01.833 --> 49:03.833
[haunting echo]

49:07.083 --> 49:07.916
Becs.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.208
[panicked breathing]

49:13.833 --> 49:15.625
Becs, is that you?

49:18.458 --> 49:21.541
Oh, God. It's so strange, isn't it?

49:22.083 --> 49:23.875
-It's so strange.
-[Dani whimpering]

49:25.541 --> 49:26.375
We just…

49:28.666 --> 49:29.666
Do you feel her?

49:29.750 --> 49:31.166
I do, a little.

49:33.333 --> 49:34.333
Miles is just, well…

49:35.458 --> 49:37.666
He's just a little tickle now, isn't he?

49:39.625 --> 49:40.541
Way at the bottom.

49:41.833 --> 49:43.250
[Hannah, distantly] Dani! Children!

49:43.333 --> 49:45.416
[Dani screams]

49:45.500 --> 49:47.916
We've got to put that one away for good.

49:49.041 --> 49:51.375
Becs, can I trust you to finish this one?

49:51.458 --> 49:53.166
I'm still not sure why we have to.

49:53.333 --> 49:54.375
[Dani moaning]

49:54.458 --> 49:55.791
[Miles] Because she knows.

49:57.125 --> 49:58.000
It's okay.

49:58.916 --> 50:01.125
Just keep her quiet,
and I'll do it myself.

50:01.208 --> 50:03.250
-[Hannah, distantly] Flora! Miles!
-[Dani screams]

50:03.333 --> 50:05.125
-[Dani] No!
-Coming!

50:05.833 --> 50:07.041
[Dani panicking]

50:07.541 --> 50:10.500
I'll be back. Don't go anywhere.

50:12.333 --> 50:13.208
[Hannah] Miles!

50:13.291 --> 50:14.791
[Dani gasping]

50:20.041 --> 50:22.583
Oh, there you are. Where is everyone?

50:23.666 --> 50:26.333
Hannah, you beautiful, beautiful thing.

50:26.416 --> 50:27.791
[scoffs]

50:27.875 --> 50:29.208
I have a surprise for you.

50:29.916 --> 50:31.291
Would you come with me?

50:31.375 --> 50:34.041
All right, but where are we going?

50:35.416 --> 50:36.291
I'll show you.

50:37.583 --> 50:38.416
Come.

50:44.208 --> 50:46.250
[Hannah] So, where-- Where are we going?

50:46.791 --> 50:47.666
[Miles] You know…

50:47.750 --> 50:49.000
[nocturnal chirping]

50:49.666 --> 50:52.333
I've been wondering
what makes you so special, I mean…

50:52.416 --> 50:55.583
I know it's disorienting at first,
but y-you've…

50:56.416 --> 50:58.750
-You really made it difficult, didn't you?
-Hm?

50:59.250 --> 51:00.791
Walking around. Day to day.

51:01.416 --> 51:03.791
Cleaning up and dreaming up new clothes.

51:03.875 --> 51:05.875
Carrying on like nothing happened.

51:07.083 --> 51:10.583
I thought you were just stubborn,
but it was more than that, wasn't it?

51:11.333 --> 51:12.333
I asked the others.

51:12.875 --> 51:15.541
They say it takes… a moment.

51:17.041 --> 51:19.333
We're all on our own time,
it seems, but you.

51:19.833 --> 51:21.875
You just kept on dreaming.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.125
Then, I worked it out.

51:24.708 --> 51:26.541
I realized who you reminded me of.

51:26.625 --> 51:29.041
[chuckles] What are you talking about?

51:29.750 --> 51:31.541
We're almost there. You'll see.

51:34.083 --> 51:36.750
I was thinking about a cartoon
I used to watch when I was little.

51:36.833 --> 51:38.875
-[Hannah] Oh, well…
-[Miles] Wile E. Coyote.

51:38.958 --> 51:42.708
[Hannah chuckles] Hate to break it to you,
Master Miles, but you're still little.

51:44.833 --> 51:45.666
[Miles chuckles]

51:46.166 --> 51:49.333
Wile E. Coyote, remember those?
It would happen all the time.

51:50.166 --> 51:51.458
He would run off a cliff.

51:52.375 --> 51:53.666
Run straight off it.

51:54.250 --> 51:55.416
And he'd keep on going.

51:56.916 --> 51:59.625
That's you.
That's who you remind me of, Hannah.

52:00.208 --> 52:01.833
You just went off that cliff,

52:02.458 --> 52:03.833
and you just kept going.

52:04.541 --> 52:05.375
Carrying on.

52:07.583 --> 52:08.708
Cleaning the house,

52:09.291 --> 52:12.625
dreaming up new outfits and earrings,
the whole thing.

52:12.708 --> 52:15.541
-What on earth are you going on about?
-But the thing is…

52:16.541 --> 52:18.541
when Wile E. Coyote looked down…

52:19.958 --> 52:20.916
then he'd fall.

52:21.875 --> 52:23.208
Only when he looked down.

52:27.583 --> 52:29.416
You just need to look down, Hannah.

52:31.750 --> 52:33.791
Then you can stop this charade.

52:33.875 --> 52:36.791
Just fall already,
into whatever dream you like,

52:36.875 --> 52:40.750
while your face melts away,
like some forgotten memory.

52:41.333 --> 52:42.208
[inhales sharply]

52:42.708 --> 52:44.916
Don't be ridiculous. Come on.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.291
-Let's go inside.
-No.

52:47.875 --> 52:52.625
I have gotten so sick of watching you,

52:52.708 --> 52:54.666
strutting around like this.

52:55.250 --> 52:58.625
No, you need to be put in your place.

52:59.333 --> 53:01.583
You need to look down.

53:17.250 --> 53:18.208
[breathes shakily]

53:26.250 --> 53:29.500
[sobbing quietly] No, no, no, no, no, no.

53:30.875 --> 53:32.875
[haunting echo]

53:37.625 --> 53:39.625
[ominous music playing]

53:54.500 --> 53:55.375
Meep, meep.

53:57.166 --> 53:58.166
[music intensifying]

54:02.833 --> 54:05.208
[Owen]
<i>This is an opportunity to hone my skills.</i>

54:05.291 --> 54:08.375
In Paris, I was a sous-chef, which means
they only let me chop vegetables.

54:08.458 --> 54:10.458
Here, I'll be putting
everything together myself.

54:10.541 --> 54:12.875
It'll be a great learning experience.

54:12.958 --> 54:14.541
You'll have two children to cook for.

54:15.041 --> 54:17.666
I don't know
that's the type of experience you want.

54:18.250 --> 54:20.583
Miles is seven, and… [chuckles]
…bloody picky.

54:21.500 --> 54:23.666
Flora's five and a darling, but…

54:26.250 --> 54:27.166
Miles is gone.

54:29.041 --> 54:30.250
And Flora might be, too.

54:35.041 --> 54:38.250
And there's nothing--
nothing I can do about it, because… [sobs]

54:40.666 --> 54:41.625
Because I'm dead.

54:45.500 --> 54:47.375
[Hannah sniffles] Oh, God.

54:47.958 --> 54:49.291
[sobs] Oh, God.

54:54.041 --> 54:54.875
Oh, God.

54:56.833 --> 54:58.833
-[melancholy music playing]
-Oh…

55:02.750 --> 55:04.750
[Dani breathing heavily]

55:06.791 --> 55:08.791
[whimpering]

55:17.791 --> 55:19.500
[breathing shakily]

55:22.208 --> 55:23.458
How did I do?

55:24.333 --> 55:25.375
You did very well.

55:26.333 --> 55:28.625
-[panicked breaths]
-She told me to pretend.

55:29.166 --> 55:30.625
He couldn't see her anymore.

55:31.541 --> 55:33.000
So, she told me what to say.

55:33.583 --> 55:34.916
Untie her, Flora. Quickly.

55:37.625 --> 55:39.125
I still don't understand.

55:39.833 --> 55:41.791
I thought we were playing a game.

55:42.750 --> 55:45.666
-And I thought you needed my help.
-[Rebecca] No, Flora.

55:45.750 --> 55:48.375
No one should ever need that much help.

55:48.458 --> 55:50.083
Not from anyone else.

55:52.416 --> 55:53.250
Miles?

55:54.708 --> 55:56.291
It's too late.

55:56.375 --> 55:58.250
It's too late, but not for her.

55:58.875 --> 56:00.416
Get her away from here.

56:00.916 --> 56:03.875
You get her as far away from this house
as you possibly can.

56:06.208 --> 56:08.000
Go on. Quickly.

56:08.583 --> 56:10.583
[panting]

56:11.375 --> 56:12.208
Thank you.

56:13.375 --> 56:15.375
[suspenseful music playing]

56:24.875 --> 56:25.958
[ominous musical swell]

56:26.041 --> 56:28.333
-[Flora] What about Miles?
-[Dani] It's okay, okay?

56:28.416 --> 56:30.041
We gotta get out of here.

56:30.125 --> 56:33.125
-[Flora] Where are we going?
-[Dani] I don't know, anywhere. Anywhere.

56:33.208 --> 56:35.250
No! I don't like this game!

56:35.333 --> 56:37.625
-[yells] I'm not leaving!
-Shh! Flora!

56:37.708 --> 56:39.083
And you can't make me!

56:39.166 --> 56:40.625
-Shh!
-[screaming] Miles!

56:40.708 --> 56:42.125
-We gotta go!
-Miles, where are you?

56:42.208 --> 56:43.541
[frightening music playing]

56:45.166 --> 56:47.166
[Flora screams]

56:55.125 --> 56:57.041
[closing theme song playing]
