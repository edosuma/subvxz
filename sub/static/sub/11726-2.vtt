WEBVTT

00:19.720 --> 00:23.756
<i>- ( men laughing )</i>
- Man: <i> No, no, no.</i>

00:23.758 --> 00:27.026
I have it on most excellent
authority, gentlemen.

00:27.028 --> 00:30.129
We already know that Washington has
allied himself with the papists,

00:30.131 --> 00:33.165
but now he has conspired
with Paris and Rome

00:33.167 --> 00:36.068
<i>to ship some 50,000 mass books,</i>

00:36.070 --> 00:37.636
<i>some 70,000 rosaries,</i>

00:37.638 --> 00:40.406
some three million
communion wafers

00:40.408 --> 00:43.175
into our humble Anglican homes.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.511
Mark my words, gentlemen,

00:45.513 --> 00:47.479
if Loyalist hearts falter,

00:47.481 --> 00:49.515
we shall be kneeling
before King Louis

00:49.517 --> 00:51.550
and calling him King of America.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.819
- ( men laugh )
- Where did you hear this, Rivington?

00:53.821 --> 00:55.354
- Let me read that.
- Oh, no, no.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.523
This is tomorrow's
"Gazette," not today's.

00:57.525 --> 01:00.192
Drink up, Colonel, while
you can still get rum

01:00.194 --> 01:01.427
and not altar wine.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.195
( men laugh )

01:03.197 --> 01:05.531
Honorable sir.
Honorable sir.

01:05.533 --> 01:09.368
I give you the first peek.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.103
Fresh off the press.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.449
Well, I'm open to criticism,

01:23.451 --> 01:25.284
but I found that
quite provocative.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.386
It didn't come off.

01:27.388 --> 01:30.456
The governor's men failed in their
task and now they've been hanged.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.559
My men? They're not my men.
I didn't pick them.

01:33.561 --> 01:36.128
Mathews: <i>No, merely drew
from</i> my pockets to pay them.

01:36.130 --> 01:38.397
Wait, now, Washington's alive?

01:38.399 --> 01:40.232
What went wrong?

01:40.234 --> 01:42.668
We're still waiting to hear
from our man in camp.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.237
Oh, now he's your man.

01:45.239 --> 01:48.574
Well, no use crying over
spilled ink, gentlemen.

01:48.576 --> 01:51.210
You'll get him next time.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.416
<i>- ( door closes )
- ( distant horse neighs )</i>

02:02.456 --> 02:04.723
Governor Tryon, Mayor Mathews.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.292
Good day, sirs.
Drinks.

02:15.703 --> 02:18.504
Stop!
Stop the damn presses!

02:18.506 --> 02:21.273
We need to remake
the front page.

02:21.275 --> 02:24.409
I want a new lead story.
Title it...

02:24.411 --> 02:26.512
"Rebel Rabble Routed
at Monmouth;

02:26.514 --> 02:28.580
Washington Left Reeling."

02:28.582 --> 02:30.916
Strip out the first column.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.552
Replace it with advertisement.

02:33.554 --> 02:36.588
Come on, man! Damn it,
this isn't a weekly.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.224
Now, hold on right there, Major.

02:39.226 --> 02:40.759
I am the royal governor
of New York.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.494
I don't report to you.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.763
And I don't mean
to suggest otherwise.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.432
I'm quite happy for you
to take any initiative

02:47.434 --> 02:48.767
against these bloody rebels.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.469
All that I ask
is that if that action

02:50.471 --> 02:52.204
involves gathering
of intelligence

02:52.206 --> 02:54.473
that my post be made aware

02:54.475 --> 02:58.510
so that one operation
doesn't run afoul of another.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.380
You have a man
in Washington's camp?

03:01.649 --> 03:03.382
Let's talk about yours.

03:03.384 --> 03:06.618
I need his name
and I need to make contact.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.756
His name is Worthington.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.891
The good Reverend Worthington.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.543
The chaplain?

03:14.544 --> 03:16.194
He takes the confessions
of the soldiers

03:16.197 --> 03:18.964
and offers them counsel.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.233
Very clever.

03:22.970 --> 03:27.239
- Mr. Rivington.
- What is it, Townsend?

03:27.241 --> 03:29.575
I'd like to buy
an advertisement.

Turn.
Turn from your evil ways.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.741

sends his regards.

<i>And should any of you have any

- Amen.
- Men: Amen.

04:52.993 --> 04:55.460
Reverend Worthington.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.031
I... I wanted
to apologize

04:59.033 --> 05:02.434
for the mishaps that attended
last week's hangings.

05:02.436 --> 05:05.671
"For the living know
that they will die,

05:05.673 --> 05:07.673
but the dead have nothing.

05:07.675 --> 05:10.475
Their love, their hatred
and their envy

05:10.477 --> 05:12.044
have now perished."

05:12.046 --> 05:15.447
Ecclesiastes, I believe.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.582
What is done is done.

05:17.584 --> 05:20.552
But if you have any qualms
of your own, Major,

05:20.554 --> 05:22.487
my door is always open.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.556
Thank you, Reverend.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.796
All right, show me.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.066
It's right here at the top, see?

05:34.068 --> 05:36.468
"French raspberry brandy."

05:36.470 --> 05:39.638
Culper Jr.,
he's raised the flag.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.474
Ben: <i>Which means his father
will have seen it by now</i>

05:42.476 --> 05:44.843
<i>and should be on his way
to New York.</i>

05:44.845 --> 05:47.546
Caleb: <i>Aye, and Culper
would have seen it too</i>

05:47.548 --> 05:49.681
<i>and be on his way to Oyster Bay.</i>

05:52.519 --> 05:55.087
Which means I best
get myself to Setauket.

05:55.089 --> 05:56.788
It's working, isn't it?

05:56.790 --> 05:58.457
- It is, Tall-boy.
- Aye.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.525
Sackett would have been proud,
the dirty old bastard.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.027
I hope so.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.798
- Major Tallmadge.
- Ah, General Arnold.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.800
Good to see you, sir.
What brings you to our camp?

06:08.802 --> 06:11.636
A swarm of gnats
and flies, Benjamin.

06:11.638 --> 06:14.106
<i>I swear I'd rather fight
two of Clinton's armies</i>

06:14.108 --> 06:16.541
than fence with bureaucrats.

06:16.543 --> 06:17.709
Where is the commander?

06:17.711 --> 06:19.711
Should be in his tent, sir.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.786
Benjamin?

06:27.788 --> 06:29.554
( chuckles )

06:29.556 --> 06:30.789
Don't you have somewhere to be?

06:30.791 --> 06:32.591
Oh, it just sounds
nice, that's all.

06:32.593 --> 06:37.763
<i>- ( horses neighing )
- ( sheep bleating )</i>

06:38.799 --> 06:40.699
<i>( chickens clucking )</i>

06:50.010 --> 06:52.010
Cheeky bastard.

06:52.012 --> 06:55.947
Waltzing into town after leaving
Eastin to rot by the road.

07:02.589 --> 07:03.922
Hello, sweetheart.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.690
Lost your friends?

07:05.692 --> 07:08.593
Captain Simcoe sent me ahead
to ready our campground.

07:08.595 --> 07:09.928
He'll be along soon.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.597
Well, soon's
all the time we need.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.734
( groans )

07:20.641 --> 07:22.874
- Hewlett: <i> Abraham.</i>
- Morning.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.445
Have a seat, Abraham.

07:27.181 --> 07:28.980
Yeah.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.819
We expecting trouble?

07:33.821 --> 07:37.622
One can't be too careful
when dealing with spies.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.191
Now sit.

07:39.193 --> 07:42.461
<i>( clock ticking )</i>

07:45.899 --> 07:48.600
Your father
has told me everything.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.702
What do you mean?

07:50.704 --> 07:52.637
Don't even pretend to deny it.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.139
It's over.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.179
I want the names of your
coconspirators in this town

08:01.181 --> 08:03.682
and your contact
in the Continental Army.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.655
You know that you
are nothing but a coward.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.824
I gave you warning
after warning.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.227
<i>You only have yourself to
blame for forcing my hand.</i>

08:15.229 --> 08:16.862
Mary:
Thomas.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.096
Hey, Thomas.
It's all right.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.699
- Sit down!
- Richard: <i> No, wait!</i>

08:20.701 --> 08:22.634
Oh, so you're gonna shoot
me in front of my son?

08:22.636 --> 08:25.136
- No!
- I mean to see you hanged.

08:27.774 --> 08:30.642
Yeah, you're right.
I'll hang.

08:30.644 --> 08:33.111
But what will
happen to you, hmm?

08:33.113 --> 08:35.780
You'll be stripped
of your command.

08:35.782 --> 08:37.883
- My command?
- <i>Yeah, well,</i> think about it.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.217
Who provided the papers
that got me into New York?

08:40.220 --> 08:43.255
<i>Whose letter got me out of jail
when I was arrested for being a spy?</i>

08:43.256 --> 08:45.023
You're the one being
brought to account here.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.791
I wonder what your
superiors in New York

08:46.793 --> 08:48.994
<i>would have to say about that.</i>

08:48.996 --> 08:50.695
You never know, you might
be hanging with me.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.031
At any rate, you'll be shown

08:53.033 --> 08:54.699
to be the fool
that you really are.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.635
You can't blackmail
your way out of this.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.136
Say good-bye to your grandson.
You won't be seeing him again.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.704
- Come on.
- ( Thomas crying )

08:59.706 --> 09:00.772
- Stop!
- Not the boy!

09:00.774 --> 09:02.941
Edmund!

09:02.943 --> 09:04.876
If you shoot my husband,
you have to shoot me, too.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.645
Mary, get out of the way.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.713
I will not let him walk free.

09:08.715 --> 09:12.050
He will not leave. He won't
leave as long as you have me.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.286
- Have you?
- As your hostage.

09:14.288 --> 09:16.154
Mary!

09:16.156 --> 09:19.724
Edmund, don't do this, please.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.226
Not like this.
Not with a child.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.931
Go.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.332
Go!

09:29.069 --> 09:31.903
But leave Thomas here,
please, for his own good.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.243
<i>( door closes )</i>

09:40.113 --> 09:43.014
( crying )

09:52.893 --> 09:54.926
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

10:05.872 --> 10:08.773
Well, it's not that bad, really.

10:08.775 --> 10:12.077
- ( wind whistling )
- Just needs a little...

10:12.079 --> 10:14.980
a little sprucing up, I think.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.616
This is gonna be your bed.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.651
Want milk.

10:19.653 --> 10:22.153
Oh, you're hungry, huh?

10:22.155 --> 10:25.056
All right, well, maybe we
can go into town afterwards

10:25.058 --> 10:26.625
and find you something there.

10:28.895 --> 10:32.931
Did I hear someone
say they're hungry?

10:32.933 --> 10:35.066
And would this be Thomas,

10:35.068 --> 10:37.102
the brave young man
I've heard all about?

10:37.104 --> 10:40.005
Don't talk to him. Don't look at him.
Don't touch him.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.941
That's a fine way
to talk to a man

10:42.943 --> 10:45.810
<i>who comes bearing gifts.</i>

10:45.812 --> 10:48.380
How about a freshly
baked apple tart?

10:48.382 --> 10:50.815
Don't feed him either.

10:50.817 --> 10:54.653
A fine father you are,
starving your only child.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.223
Go play outside.
Go on.

10:58.225 --> 10:59.824
Up.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.826
It's hard to see
past your stomach

11:01.828 --> 11:04.429
when you're your age, young lad.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.167
Who'd you rob?

11:09.169 --> 11:11.770
A little foraging expedition.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.272
I foraged this
from the Dutch boy's privy.

11:14.274 --> 11:19.277
Normally it isn't even fit
to wipe your arse with

11:19.279 --> 11:21.980
except for this little item

11:21.982 --> 11:23.314
on the top of the page.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.016
Why don't you take
a look at that?

11:27.087 --> 11:29.387
That's your code word, isn't it?

11:29.389 --> 11:31.089
Means your man in New York's got

11:31.091 --> 11:33.792
some intelligence
coming your way.

11:33.794 --> 11:37.996
You forget that I read every
single letter in your lair.

11:37.998 --> 11:42.000
So now you're to ride
for Oyster Bay

11:42.002 --> 11:44.803
and to collect from
the Quaker's father.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.438
- Go on with you.
- No.

11:46.440 --> 11:50.041
- Well, no, I won't be riding anywhere.
- Why not?

11:52.179 --> 11:53.978
I can't leave the boy, so...

11:53.980 --> 11:56.181
Ah, a little tiff
with the wife, eh?

11:56.183 --> 11:58.316
Well, that's fine.
I'll go.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.318
No.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.121
Fine, then you go
and I'll watch the boy.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.025
Ah, I wasn't asking anyway.

12:09.362 --> 12:13.398
Look, wait. Hewlett
knows about me.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.035
He knows everything. The ring is done.
It's over.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.403
Then why are you still here

12:18.405 --> 12:20.972
and not dangling
from a noose, huh?

12:20.974 --> 12:22.340
Huh?

12:22.342 --> 12:24.075
You look at me.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.179
You're blackmailing him,
aren't you?

12:28.181 --> 12:30.048
Ha ha!

12:30.050 --> 12:32.350
Which means the ring ain't done

12:32.352 --> 12:35.220
and I'm away to Oyster Bay.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.056
Good-bye, Thomas.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.192
Want Mama.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.231
I know you do, Sprout.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.933
I know you do, little man.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.502
Come here.
Come here.

12:52.372 --> 12:55.340
We are going to get
her back, all right?

13:01.915 --> 13:03.948
( men laughing )

13:03.950 --> 13:05.950
- ( screams )
- Don't worry, lad.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.452
We've all tasted the lash.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.421
Part of being a footman
in the King's Army.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.957
- ( grunts )
- ( laughing )

13:12.959 --> 13:15.527
- ( grunts )
- Oh.

13:15.529 --> 13:19.397
Besides, this way,
when we hang you,

13:19.399 --> 13:21.199
it will seem a mercy.

13:21.201 --> 13:24.569
- ( all talking at once )
- ( hammers clicking )

13:27.974 --> 13:30.441
( horses neigh )

13:34.548 --> 13:38.116
I see you prefer
your adversaries helpless.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.387
Perhaps you'd like to try
your luck with one who isn't.

13:43.557 --> 13:45.256
I didn't think so.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.391
( grunts )

13:46.393 --> 13:48.560
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

13:48.562 --> 13:51.396
( grunts )
No, no, no!

13:54.100 --> 13:57.035
( shouts )

13:58.104 --> 14:01.105
- He is taking hostages?
- Yes, four.

14:01.107 --> 14:04.509
The rest of the company is in the
village green awaiting your orders.

14:06.179 --> 14:09.113
Whatever provocation
our men may have given,

14:09.115 --> 14:12.483
this bloody business
with Captain Simcoe ends now.

14:12.485 --> 14:15.119
And if it takes open battle,

14:15.121 --> 14:16.588
so be it.

14:16.590 --> 14:19.023
<i>( door closes )</i>

14:19.025 --> 14:21.960
Sir, Captain Simcoe
here to see you.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.495
- What?
- He rides alone under flag of truce.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.434
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

14:31.071 --> 14:33.037
<i>( distant horse neighs )</i>

14:33.039 --> 14:34.505
( sipping )

14:37.377 --> 14:39.410
Thank you.

14:39.412 --> 14:43.248
Perhaps it would be best to
keep that flag of truce handy.

14:43.250 --> 14:46.184
I wouldn't want my guards
to find cause to shoot you.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.019
<i>That would be unfortunate,</i>

14:48.021 --> 14:50.989
as you'd then be responsible
for five deaths.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.157
If I don't return in an hour,

14:53.159 --> 14:56.628
the soldiers I took into custody for
assaulting Private O'Shaughnessy

14:56.630 --> 15:00.131
will be executed
for their crime.

15:00.133 --> 15:03.101
By the way, how is Mrs.
Strong settling in?

15:03.103 --> 15:05.103
You will release my men at once

15:05.105 --> 15:08.106
or you will get this war that
you are so clearly courting.

15:08.108 --> 15:11.542
Perhaps war is the point.

15:11.544 --> 15:14.012
The reason I came here
is to inform you

15:14.014 --> 15:16.247
that it could be a third
party is responsible,

15:16.249 --> 15:19.651
someone who hopes to encourage
conflict between us.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.552
What third party?

15:21.554 --> 15:26.157
Major Andrí has informed me of a
spy operating out of Long Island,

15:26.159 --> 15:28.192
a man named Samuel Culper.

15:28.194 --> 15:30.361
I see.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.665
First I'm to believe that Ensign
Norwich hanged himself last spring

15:33.667 --> 15:37.602
and now that a rebel spy
killed Corporal Eastin.

15:37.604 --> 15:41.205
Well, when you sort
through your beliefs,

15:41.207 --> 15:44.676
you may come to realize
that war with me is unwise.

15:45.679 --> 15:47.512
So I'll leave it to you

15:47.514 --> 15:49.681
<i>to mete out the discipline
your men deserve.</i>

15:49.683 --> 15:55.086
50 lashes each to be
witnessed by both our units.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.055
Otherwise I'll do it myself,

15:57.057 --> 15:59.691
undermining any pretense
of authority you have left.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.261
<i>You have 24 hours.</i>

16:04.331 --> 16:06.698
( sips )

16:06.700 --> 16:09.600
- ( chatter )
- <i>( horse neighs )</i>

16:09.602 --> 16:11.469
This is all Reed's doing.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.471
When he said that he had
sent his charges to you,

16:13.473 --> 16:15.673
I knew I had to ride
here immediately.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.576
Not that I imagined for an instant
that you would believe his slanders.

16:20.714 --> 16:24.182
So why, then, do you think he's
so intent on pursuing them?

16:24.184 --> 16:26.317
Why did he vilify you
behind your back

16:26.319 --> 16:28.252
when he was your adjutant?

16:28.254 --> 16:31.489
Because he seeks to undermine
those he is threatened by.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.591
I challenged the sole
and sovereign authority

16:33.593 --> 16:35.593
he wishes to wield
over Philadelphia.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.196
The man's had it in for me
ever since I assumed the post.

16:38.198 --> 16:41.466
And you've done fine work
restoring the city to order.

16:41.468 --> 16:44.168
Whilst trying to put
my own house in order.

16:44.170 --> 16:47.739
Which is what Reed now uses as
the basis for his accusations.

16:47.741 --> 16:52.677
I've heard that you have requisitioned
Penn Mansion for your headquarters.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.613
Not just for a command
post, but for my home.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.484
I'm to be married, George,

16:59.486 --> 17:01.519
to a woman of means

17:01.521 --> 17:04.155
who expects at least
some comfort and amenity,

17:04.156 --> 17:06.523
things I could easily
provide if Congress

17:06.526 --> 17:08.693
would only reimburse me
what they owe me for Quebec.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.162
- £10,000?
- Yes.

17:11.164 --> 17:13.631
I'm not sure that Congress
could reimburse you

17:13.633 --> 17:16.601
even if they wanted to or that you
would be wise to accept their payment.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.435
And why, for God's sake, not?

17:18.438 --> 17:21.406
To support the war, they've
continued to print currency

17:21.407 --> 17:24.509
like the biweekly tabloids
that spew out of New York.

17:26.246 --> 17:30.648
The result is our dollar
has devalued to the point

17:30.650 --> 17:33.818
where I fear we'll not be able
to finance another campaign.

17:36.356 --> 17:40.324
So Reed and his lackeys
in Congress

17:40.326 --> 17:43.661
get to burn down their house
even as he undermines mine?

17:43.663 --> 17:46.531
He has gone so far as to
insinuate treason, George.

17:46.533 --> 17:50.234
Treason. What do I do against
such a ruthless assault?

17:52.806 --> 17:55.173
Apply for court-martial.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.208
Submit myself for trial?

17:57.210 --> 17:58.576
A military trial.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.512
Take it out of their court,
put it into ours.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.348
Restore your honor

18:04.350 --> 18:08.086
and put an end
to these ugly rumors...

18:10.690 --> 18:12.590
once and for all.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.603
Robert.

18:25.605 --> 18:29.440
It seems this old Quaker is too
plain for your establishment.

18:32.378 --> 18:35.279
Perhaps he didn't notice
your silver buckles.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.748
Yes, I'm trying to be
more inconspicuous.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.717
Yes, well, speaking of which...

18:39.719 --> 18:41.686
Yes?

18:41.688 --> 18:44.288
Give my regards
to Mr. Culper.

18:44.290 --> 18:49.427
Ah, yes.
I shall indeed.

18:49.429 --> 18:52.730
- Now, tell me how...
- So this is Townsend Sr.?

18:52.732 --> 18:54.732
The paterfamilias?

18:54.734 --> 18:58.302
The mighty oak from which
this hard nut has fallen?

18:58.304 --> 19:00.304
Welcome to our
humble coffeehouse.

19:00.306 --> 19:03.274
Father, this is my partner Mr.
Rivington.

19:03.276 --> 19:06.477
James Rivington, Printer to the
King's Most Excellent Majesty.

19:06.479 --> 19:10.414
And what is this treasure that you
are clutching ever so tightly?

19:10.416 --> 19:12.683
That is a Geneva Bible

19:12.685 --> 19:15.753
that my father
asked me to track down.

19:15.755 --> 19:18.489
It is very important
to our faith.

19:19.626 --> 19:22.860
- May I?
- Certainly.

19:24.430 --> 19:27.665
Oh, I've always wondered
what you Quakers read.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.468
Not that I have much room
for comparison.

19:32.906 --> 19:35.773
I take it you're not
a religious man.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.642
I'm a newsman,

19:37.644 --> 19:40.511
which is a religion all its own.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.513
<i>While others worship mysteries,</i>

19:42.515 --> 19:44.916
I seek to dispel them.

19:44.918 --> 19:46.851
I pray thee, Brother Samuel,

19:46.853 --> 19:49.754
lift the veil on the
mystery of your son here.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.789
<i>He says so little.</i>

19:51.791 --> 19:54.592
He may ration his
words, but with Robert

19:54.594 --> 19:56.460
I always say what you
see is what you get.

19:56.462 --> 19:58.829
<i>Really, now?
It's always the quiet ones</i>

19:58.831 --> 20:02.667
that have the darkest
secrets, don't they?

20:02.669 --> 20:06.938
Or perhaps their darkest,
most shameful secret

20:06.940 --> 20:09.507
is that they have none.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.309
Hmm.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.510
<i>- ( door opens )
- ( horse neighs )</i>

20:12.512 --> 20:15.713
Oh, welcome!
James Rivington,

20:15.715 --> 20:19.817
<i>printer to the king's
most imposing majesty.</i>

20:19.819 --> 20:22.820
Problem is that by taking
control of the garrison,

20:22.822 --> 20:24.655
they have command
of the high ground

20:24.657 --> 20:26.490
and they have our cannon.

20:26.492 --> 20:29.427
So we lay siege.
Starve them out.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.329
No, this needs to be
swift and decisive.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.830
Get me a proper count
of their men

20:32.832 --> 20:34.632
and see if they've
moved our cannons.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.639
( sighs )

20:41.641 --> 20:43.741
( door closes )

20:46.546 --> 20:49.680
You're planning
to attack Simcoe?

20:49.682 --> 20:52.416
He's left me no choice.

20:52.418 --> 20:53.784
And it is not only Simcoe.

20:53.786 --> 20:56.587
This business
with Abraham Woodhull...

20:56.589 --> 20:59.657
I feel like I'm besieged
on two sides,

20:59.659 --> 21:01.759
like Odysseus

21:01.761 --> 21:04.362
trying to steer between
Scylla and Charybdis.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.530
That's from Homer, isn't it?

21:06.532 --> 21:08.532
Indeed.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.768
They were a pair
of sea monsters,

21:10.770 --> 21:12.503
one a six-headed giant

21:12.505 --> 21:15.439
and the other
a massive whirlpool.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.009
They guarded two sides
of a narrow strait.

21:18.011 --> 21:21.012
To avoid one, sailors would have
to sail too close by the other.

21:21.014 --> 21:23.848
So how did Odysseus prevail?

21:23.850 --> 21:25.549
He didn't.

21:25.551 --> 21:27.385
Realizing his entire
ship would be lost

21:27.387 --> 21:28.786
if he passed too close
to the whirlpool,

21:28.788 --> 21:31.622
he chose instead
a course by Scylla,

21:31.624 --> 21:35.593
sacrificing six of his men
to each of its hungry heads.

21:37.897 --> 21:40.865
Simcoe is Charybdis.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.734
You can't beat him.

21:43.736 --> 21:46.404
One thing I have learned
from the classics is tactics.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.739
- I will find a way.
- Tactics won't help with Simcoe.

21:48.741 --> 21:52.743
It is nature that's the
problem, and yours.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.412
Mine?

21:54.414 --> 21:56.047
Well, you could have shot
him while he was here,

21:56.049 --> 21:58.015
but you didn't.

21:58.017 --> 22:00.818
Shot an unarmed man
under the flag of truce?

22:00.820 --> 22:03.854
The fact that even now

22:03.856 --> 22:08.059
you can't stoop to his level
is to your credit, Edmund.

22:09.729 --> 22:13.764
You're a good and decent man.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.600
So my only choice is to submit?

22:16.602 --> 22:19.503
If you're feeling trapped

22:19.505 --> 22:23.641
between the proverbial
rock and the hard place,

22:23.643 --> 22:27.078
why not use the rock
to smash the hard place?

22:28.781 --> 22:31.882
Last year Simcoe
framed you for murder

22:31.884 --> 22:34.785
and used rebel soldiers
to try to kill you.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.954
Why not return the favor

22:36.956 --> 22:39.890
by using rebels that you've
just been made aware of

22:39.892 --> 22:42.626
to kill him?

22:46.099 --> 22:48.466
What? No!

22:48.468 --> 22:49.934
At least listen to the plan.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.969
The plan?
There's a plan?

22:51.971 --> 22:54.705
- At first you conspire with Hewlett...
- No.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.674
- ...to lure Simcoe into an ambush.
- Did you just miss my second no?

22:56.676 --> 22:59.677
And then Caleb springs the trap,
leaving Hewlett's hands clean.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.484
This is a terrible idea.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.986
Because I had it or because
you don't think it will work?

23:08.988 --> 23:11.555
Why would I help stop a war
I fought so hard to begin?

23:11.557 --> 23:14.058
Because otherwise
Simcoe will win.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.127
And he knows the name Culper.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.997
I heard him say it.

23:19.999 --> 23:23.000
It's only a matter of time
before he closes in on you.

23:23.002 --> 23:25.603
This way, you can
take care of him.

23:25.605 --> 23:29.173
And at the same time gain another
hedge against Hewlett turning you in.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.412
Abe.

23:36.949 --> 23:39.049
You're welcome.

23:43.890 --> 23:47.057
- Stay close.
- ( horse snorts, neighs )

23:49.929 --> 23:53.531
<i>( creature calls )</i>

23:53.533 --> 23:55.733
- <i>( horse nickers )</i>
- ( mutters quietly )

23:55.735 --> 23:58.602
<i>( distant dog barking )</i>

23:58.604 --> 24:01.972
- Raspberry brandy.
- Who's that?

24:01.974 --> 24:06.911
I'm sorry, are you not,
eh, Samuel Townsend?

24:06.913 --> 24:08.646
I am.

24:08.648 --> 24:11.782
Aye, Woodhull told me
that you'd know that...

24:11.784 --> 24:16.654
I mean, Culper told me
you'd know the code word.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.557
I don't know
any Woodhull or Culper.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.859
Nor do I know you, mister...

24:21.861 --> 24:23.127
Ah.

24:23.129 --> 24:26.564
Eh, uh, Austin Roe's the name.

24:26.566 --> 24:28.766
But that's not my real name, eh.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.734
My real name's...
well, no.

24:30.736 --> 24:32.970
He said you wouldn't
want to know my real name

24:32.972 --> 24:36.674
because, well, just in case
you were captured

24:36.676 --> 24:38.776
and tortured.

24:38.778 --> 24:41.045
All right, I think I've had enough
of this game and of you, sir.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.847
Excuse me, sir, please.

24:42.849 --> 24:44.949
I mean, I'm just a humble
cabbage farmer, sir.

24:44.951 --> 24:48.118
I'm just a little bit
over my head, you know?

24:48.120 --> 24:50.754
( sighs )
Fine.

24:50.756 --> 24:52.723
( chuckles )

24:52.725 --> 24:54.925
Fine, then why didn't this...

24:54.927 --> 24:57.895
Culper person come himself?

24:57.897 --> 25:01.599
He had his hands full
in Setauket

25:01.601 --> 25:03.234
with some very important
business, so he said

25:03.236 --> 25:06.670
you come and be the courier.

25:06.672 --> 25:09.773
Right? He even told me about
how to find your place

25:09.775 --> 25:11.809
with the barn burned out.

25:11.811 --> 25:14.645
King's men did this, eh?

25:14.647 --> 25:17.114
No, they were Queen's Rangers.

25:17.116 --> 25:20.885
The Queen's Rangers?

25:20.887 --> 25:23.120
Oh, they used to have honor.

25:23.122 --> 25:26.724
You confuse me, sir.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.259
You mourn the Rangers,

25:28.261 --> 25:31.128
but you also seem to be
claiming that you're

25:31.130 --> 25:32.997
some kind of Patriot.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.866
I wasn't always.

25:37.637 --> 25:40.704
No, like most,

25:40.706 --> 25:43.807
I was gulled into
believing that King George

25:43.809 --> 25:46.877
was my sovereign
and my protector.

25:46.879 --> 25:52.082
Aye, but I learned
through hard experience

25:52.084 --> 25:54.919
that that man
is not to be trusted.

25:56.289 --> 25:59.156
Well, I'm sorry
that you don't trust me.

25:59.158 --> 26:01.792
So good night, then, to you.

26:02.828 --> 26:04.194
Good night.

26:07.033 --> 26:09.033
Wait.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.747
From one Patriot to another.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.756
- <i>( music playing )</i>
- ( chatter )

26:36.862 --> 26:39.029
Bugger me to hell.

26:39.031 --> 26:41.832
I swear you have
the luck of the devil.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.201
Is that your secret?

26:44.203 --> 26:46.937
<i>You made a pact
with the horned god?</i>

26:46.939 --> 26:49.206
Robert:
<i>Only for draughts.</i>

26:49.208 --> 26:51.342
- <i>( woman laughs )
- Woman #2:</i> ...as handsome as they say?</i>

26:51.344 --> 26:54.011
- Woman: <i>That's not</i> all they say.
- Woman #2: <i> Oh!</i>

26:54.013 --> 26:56.246
( laughing )

27:00.286 --> 27:01.885
<i>James Rivington, ladies.</i>

27:01.887 --> 27:04.221
So pleased you could come
to my establishment.

27:04.223 --> 27:07.224
Dare I risk my luck
against the devil's?

27:07.226 --> 27:08.926
Don't tell my partner,

27:08.928 --> 27:11.261
but luck has little
to do with it.

27:11.263 --> 27:13.263
Rivington's your partner?

27:13.265 --> 27:17.134
I have an interest
in the establishment.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.903
And you are an entrepreneur.

27:19.905 --> 27:22.373
I suppose you could
say that, yes.

27:22.375 --> 27:24.241
I'd be proud to.

27:25.745 --> 27:28.245
It truly is a new world,
isn't it?

27:28.247 --> 27:32.816
Even the air is alive
with possibilities.

27:32.818 --> 27:35.819
With electricity that Franklin
pulled down out of the sky

27:35.821 --> 27:37.955
and trapped in a jar.

27:39.959 --> 27:43.293
Only I assume to watch it
fade to a dim glow.

27:45.064 --> 27:47.831
You are a poet
as well as an artist.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.833
- I dabble.
- <i>( door opens )</i>

27:49.835 --> 27:51.268
Rivington:
<i>Is it morning already?</i>

27:51.270 --> 27:53.871
Oh, my dear, when you
enter my establishment,

27:53.873 --> 27:56.774
it's as if the sun
has banished the darkness.

27:56.776 --> 27:59.843
Gentlemen, may I introduce
Miss Philomena Cheer.

27:59.845 --> 28:02.146
If you have the time and coin,
you really should see her

28:02.148 --> 28:04.982
<i>play Hypolita at the
John Street Theatre.</i>

28:04.984 --> 28:06.383
Man:
<i>What's the play?</i>

28:06.385 --> 28:09.420
"She Would
and She Would Not."

28:09.422 --> 28:12.856
Rivington: <i>Yes, my
dear, but would you?</i>

28:12.858 --> 28:16.694
- Oh, for you, James, always.
- Mm.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.367
New York is exciting again

28:23.369 --> 28:25.436
now that so many of our friends

28:25.438 --> 28:28.005
have returned to us
from Philadelphia.

28:29.842 --> 28:34.945
I fear I am keeping you from
a more engaging conversation.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.414
I've already had
that conversation.

28:37.416 --> 28:41.452
I require more monastic
pursuits these days.

28:44.323 --> 28:47.357
Fortunately, your monastery
is in your head,

28:47.359 --> 28:50.160
allowing rapid egress

28:50.162 --> 28:52.496
as mood or conditions warrant.

28:56.335 --> 28:59.169
I forgot to ask your name.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.438
Robert Townsend at your service.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.241
Major John Andrí at yours.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.944
( coughs, clears throat )

29:12.451 --> 29:14.985
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

29:20.126 --> 29:22.359
<i>( creature calls )</i>

29:27.166 --> 29:30.467
So this is what
it's like to be a spy

29:30.469 --> 29:33.904
skulking around at night.

29:33.906 --> 29:36.006
Actually, it's more about
fooling the gullible

29:36.008 --> 29:37.908
so one can do one's skulking
in the light of day.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.943
Don't push too hard, Woodhull.

29:39.945 --> 29:42.045
Your wife isn't here
to protect you.

29:42.047 --> 29:43.914
Nor are your guards here
to stop me from dropping

29:43.916 --> 29:46.049
another king's man
by the side of the road.

29:46.051 --> 29:49.286
You murdered Eastin
in cold blood?

29:49.288 --> 29:52.256
Lukewarm. The man did
shoot my father.

29:52.258 --> 29:55.926
I've come to learn
that pragmatism

29:55.928 --> 29:58.529
must at times trump ideals

29:58.531 --> 30:00.264
or emotions.

30:00.266 --> 30:02.065
Though I'm sure
in this case you'll agree

30:02.067 --> 30:05.269
that Simcoe dead is ideal
for all concerned.

30:11.277 --> 30:14.077
All right.

30:14.079 --> 30:17.080
Say I agree, then what?

30:17.082 --> 30:18.515
Contact your friends.

30:18.517 --> 30:22.085
No, I mean once Simcoe is
dead, what happens next?

30:22.087 --> 30:25.222
You leave Setauket.

30:25.224 --> 30:29.259
You and your wife and your son.

30:29.261 --> 30:32.095
I expect you'll find a warm
welcome in Washington's camp.

30:35.568 --> 30:37.401
So, um...

30:41.173 --> 30:45.943
I hear Simcoe knows
the name Culper.

30:45.945 --> 30:49.346
We'll use that name
to bait the trap for him.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.515
You're Culper, aren't you?

30:53.519 --> 30:56.053
What do you care?

30:56.055 --> 30:58.121
I don't.

30:58.123 --> 31:01.158
But there is something that
I care very deeply about.

31:02.528 --> 31:06.463
Can I trust a rebel spy
to keep his word?

31:08.133 --> 31:11.034
Can I trust a redcoat
officer to keep his?

31:13.973 --> 31:16.974
Well, then, let me propose

31:16.976 --> 31:20.510
that to this end
and to this end only

31:20.512 --> 31:24.514
we put aside our mistrust

31:24.516 --> 31:28.118
and kill this murdering bastard.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.503
I fear this many backs

31:46.505 --> 31:50.507
presents too broad a canvas
for a single painter

31:50.509 --> 31:54.177
no matter how enthusiastic
to complete.

31:54.179 --> 31:57.014
I think I'm going to have to ask

31:57.016 --> 32:00.183
Private O'Shaughnessy to assist.

32:00.185 --> 32:03.420
Ah, it appears I can
turn this pleasant task

32:03.422 --> 32:06.023
over to your commander.

32:06.025 --> 32:08.025
<i>Major.</i>

32:08.027 --> 32:11.194
I think you'll find
submission suits you.

32:11.196 --> 32:14.131
I didn't come here
to agree to your terms.

32:15.334 --> 32:17.634
I'm here with a proposal.

32:17.636 --> 32:20.470
Please.

32:20.472 --> 32:23.040
I've been thinking
about what you said

32:23.042 --> 32:25.108
about a third party

32:25.110 --> 32:27.144
playing us against each other.

32:27.146 --> 32:30.113
And about that name, Copler.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.549
- Culper.
- Right.

32:32.551 --> 32:36.353
Much as it pains me to admit it,

32:36.355 --> 32:38.655
you may have been correct.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.624
When I was first here,

32:40.626 --> 32:43.260
I compiled a list
of tips from sources

32:43.262 --> 32:45.462
around the Suffolk County
and surrounding areas.

32:45.464 --> 32:48.565
- The potential troublemakers.
- I understand.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.434
Well...

32:53.505 --> 32:55.238
look at this.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.243
So it's not an alias.

33:00.245 --> 33:02.179
Samuel Culper.

33:02.181 --> 33:03.680
Rocky Point.

33:05.284 --> 33:07.184
A day's ride east.

33:07.186 --> 33:11.588
I believe that we should capture
him in a joint operation.

33:11.590 --> 33:14.091
Bury the hatchet
between our two forces,

33:14.093 --> 33:17.094
get on with our job
as the king intended us to do.

33:17.096 --> 33:18.595
The task was appointed to me,

33:18.597 --> 33:21.498
but I thank you for the gesture
and for the information.

33:21.500 --> 33:25.469
The Queen's Rangers will make sure
that this instigator pays dearly.

33:25.471 --> 33:28.438
In the meantime,
I return your men to you

33:28.440 --> 33:31.608
for you to discipline them
as you see fit.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.343
<i>My horse!</i>

33:37.483 --> 33:39.483
<i>Fall in.</i>

33:50.329 --> 33:52.429
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

34:01.140 --> 34:03.040
<i>( creature calls )</i>

34:07.212 --> 34:10.213
<i>( animal howls )</i>

34:14.386 --> 34:16.485
<i>( fire crackling )</i>

34:18.489 --> 34:20.456
( humming )

34:22.561 --> 34:24.628
All right, what's going on?
What are you doing, huh?

34:24.630 --> 34:27.531
Invisible ink.
Smells like horse piss, eh?

34:27.533 --> 34:28.764
What's this?

34:30.302 --> 34:31.802
- Did you...
- What?

34:31.804 --> 34:34.471
Did you steal this from
Samuel Townsend, did you?

34:34.473 --> 34:36.739
It was handed to me.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.376
Well, to Austin Roe, rather.

34:39.378 --> 34:40.811
- Austin Roe?
- Uh-huh.

34:40.813 --> 34:42.512
<i>Who the hell is Austin Roe?</i>

34:44.650 --> 34:46.349
( blows )

34:46.351 --> 34:49.386
Austin Roe is a humble
cabbage farmer.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.221
A bit jumpy.
You'd like him.

34:51.223 --> 34:53.690
You've wasted the reagent, man.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.826
Now let's see

34:55.828 --> 35:00.397
what the horse piss
doth reveal to me.

35:00.399 --> 35:03.533
Oh, Reverend Worthington.

35:03.535 --> 35:06.436
A dirty preacher.
Is there no end

35:06.438 --> 35:10.373
to all this wickedness and
treachery in these fallen times?

35:10.375 --> 35:12.409
All right, thanks.

35:17.516 --> 35:21.651
Nothing about my friend Andrí.

35:21.653 --> 35:23.653
I'll take it to the drop.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.289
I'm going with you.

35:26.291 --> 35:29.392
No, no, no, no.
You can't come with me.

35:29.394 --> 35:31.514
If my courier sees me with
you, I'm cut from the ring.

35:32.764 --> 35:35.232
What do you mean
if he sees you with me?

35:35.234 --> 35:39.503
I thought you were just dropping
that and he was picking it up.

35:39.505 --> 35:41.304
Eh?

35:41.306 --> 35:42.706
Well...

35:42.708 --> 35:48.445
Why do you persist
in lying to me, boy?

35:48.447 --> 35:50.247
Hmm?

35:50.249 --> 35:52.315
- Why?
- I don't know.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.551
Don't do that.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.887
You listen to me.

35:56.889 --> 35:59.756
What you gonna talk
to him about?

35:59.758 --> 36:02.425
Not me, I hope.
No?

36:02.427 --> 36:04.327
Why would I talk about you?

36:07.332 --> 36:08.832
Right.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.834
What? What do you need this for?

36:10.836 --> 36:12.769
- What are you gonna do with that?
- Nothing.

36:12.771 --> 36:15.672
So long as you don't talk
about me with the whaler.

36:15.674 --> 36:18.375
But just know that she

36:18.377 --> 36:22.445
will be watching you
all the time.

36:24.449 --> 36:26.283
Aye?

36:26.285 --> 36:28.818
<i>- ( frogs croaking )
- ( crickets chirping )</i>

36:31.456 --> 36:33.657
<i>( creature calling )</i>

36:40.632 --> 36:42.699
( whistles )

36:42.701 --> 36:44.634
Christ.

36:46.471 --> 36:47.804
What the hell
are you doing here?

36:47.806 --> 36:49.806
What's the problem?

36:49.808 --> 36:52.309
- No problem.
- You're here, there's a problem.

36:52.311 --> 36:53.610
No, it's not a problem.

36:53.612 --> 36:54.811
It's an opportunity, all right?

36:54.813 --> 36:56.479
Here.

36:56.481 --> 36:58.348
Somehow Simcoe has learned
the name Culper

36:58.350 --> 36:59.883
and I fear Andrí
may know it as well.

37:01.486 --> 37:03.420
- Yeah, we know.
- What do you mean you know?

37:03.422 --> 37:04.821
Name was in the papers
stolen from our camp.

37:04.823 --> 37:07.724
- Abe: What?
- Some guy called Gamble.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.826
He was the one who killed Mr.
Sackett and stole the papers.

37:09.828 --> 37:11.661
- When did this happen?
- I don't know, a while ago.

37:11.663 --> 37:14.531
So why didn't you tell me?
Hey, I need to know this shite.

37:14.533 --> 37:16.466
<i>All right?
I need to know everything.</i>

37:16.468 --> 37:18.735
Yeah, are you
telling me everything?

37:20.806 --> 37:22.195
What does that mean?

37:22.196 --> 37:23.585
That means are you telling
me why you're here?

37:23.586 --> 37:24.975
- Of course I am.
- <i>( rustling )</i>

37:28.714 --> 37:32.682
Jesus!
Her, too?

37:32.684 --> 37:34.851
<i>Annie, what is this, a reunion?</i>

37:34.853 --> 37:36.686
Hello, Caleb. I thought
I should be here

37:36.688 --> 37:38.555
when Abraham tells you my plan.

37:38.557 --> 37:40.857
- Your plan?
- All right, we're not here to boast.

37:40.859 --> 37:42.525
Doesn't matter
whose plan it was.

37:42.527 --> 37:45.395
The point is,
we have found a way

37:45.397 --> 37:47.931
to frame a certain Tory
who lives in Rocky Point.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.833
Simcoe thinks
that this man is Culper

37:49.835 --> 37:52.469
and he'll be setting out
to arrest him.

37:52.471 --> 37:54.437
Right, but instead
you want me to ambush him.

37:54.439 --> 37:57.540
- There you go.
- Nice.

37:57.542 --> 37:59.876
- Uh, did you say Rocky Point?
- Mm-hmm.

37:59.878 --> 38:03.546
That Tory wouldn't happen
to be our old friend Beekman?

38:03.548 --> 38:05.615
- That's the one.
- Nice.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.550
Look, I'd love it if Simcoe
doesn't survive this time.

38:07.552 --> 38:09.419
Oh, trust me,
he'll be a dead man.

38:09.421 --> 38:13.890
Wait. I need to know what happens
when Abraham leaves Setauket.

38:13.892 --> 38:16.760
<i>Ask Ben... should I report
to him directly?</i>

38:16.762 --> 38:17.894
You're leaving?

38:17.896 --> 38:19.829
What's this?

38:19.831 --> 38:21.831
You didn't tell him, did you?

38:24.469 --> 38:26.703
Tell me what?

38:26.705 --> 38:28.705
His father sold him
out to Hewlett.

38:28.707 --> 38:31.608
Your father? What, you didn't
think that worth a mention?

38:31.610 --> 38:33.777
I am handling it.

38:33.779 --> 38:35.812
<i>Hewlett is a part of the
ambush plan, all right?</i>

38:35.814 --> 38:37.447
And once it's done,
I'll take care of him.

38:37.449 --> 38:38.682
And Ben doesn't need to know.

38:38.684 --> 38:40.450
I'm already keeping
one secret for you.

38:40.452 --> 38:42.752
- What do you mean?
- You can keep one more.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.654
- What do you mean you'll take care of him?
- What do you think I mean?

38:44.656 --> 38:46.089
Just keep it down.

38:48.960 --> 38:53.663
- No, you made a deal with him.
- I'm not leaving, Anna. Hewlett is.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.499
He knows the name Culper
just the same as Simcoe does.

38:56.501 --> 38:59.035
- And once Simcoe is dead, Hewlett is next.
- No, you don't have...

38:59.037 --> 39:00.938
If you want to stop me,
you're gonna have to kill me.

39:00.939 --> 39:01.639
What?

39:01.740 --> 39:03.940
The only way for you to save
Hewlett is if you warn him.

39:03.942 --> 39:06.576
If you warn him, I swing from the
gallows, so it's your choice.

39:06.578 --> 39:08.778
It's me or him.

39:10.716 --> 39:12.716
You should get out of here.

39:31.837 --> 39:36.973
<i>( voice echoing, indistinct )</i>

39:36.975 --> 39:40.944
( faint, echoing ) "As surely as I
live, declares the sovereign Lord,

39:40.946 --> 39:44.647
I take no pleasure
in the death of the wicked,

39:44.649 --> 39:48.885
but rather that they turn
from their ways and live."

39:48.887 --> 39:52.021
Worthington took the confessions
of both Bradford and Hickey

39:52.023 --> 39:54.891
and it's likely he was their
go-between with British intelligence.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.894
What's more, he's been extracting
information from other soldiers

39:57.896 --> 40:00.497
under the guise of offering
guidance and moral counsel.

40:00.499 --> 40:02.031
Your recommendation?

40:02.033 --> 40:04.634
Well, we can't arrest him.
We can't hang him, sir.

40:04.636 --> 40:06.102
The news would leak out.

40:06.104 --> 40:08.571
And it could expose
Culper Jr. as the source.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.140
Right.

40:10.142 --> 40:12.108
So we kill him.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.677
Quietly.
I'll do it myself.

40:14.679 --> 40:17.514
- Uh, sir.
- Yes, Lieutenant?

40:17.516 --> 40:19.582
Shouldn't we at least
wait long enough

40:19.584 --> 40:23.153
or keep him alive long enough until
we can identify his contact?

40:23.155 --> 40:25.422
And, yeah.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.862
Make it look like an
accident if you can.

40:32.864 --> 40:35.131
What? Sir...

40:35.133 --> 40:37.167
I mean, just like that?

40:37.169 --> 40:41.171
The risk of exposing
Culper Jr. far outweighs

40:41.173 --> 40:44.774
any tactical advantage gained
by letting Worthington live.

40:48.680 --> 40:51.114
It's a pity. I rather
liked his sermons.

40:54.019 --> 40:56.119
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

41:00.859 --> 41:02.692
<i>( door opens )</i>

41:07.866 --> 41:09.732
Ah, there you are.

41:09.734 --> 41:11.935
Securing the garrison
took longer than I expected.

41:11.937 --> 41:14.571
It seems our defenses
have grown sloppy

41:14.573 --> 41:16.139
while the Rangers
have been away.

41:17.209 --> 41:19.108
Has Simcoe left yet?

41:19.110 --> 41:21.845
He's been preparing
his camp all day.

41:21.847 --> 41:24.080
I expect he'll leave
in the morning.

41:24.082 --> 41:26.683
What did Abraham say?

41:26.685 --> 41:29.819
He said he passed his
information on to his contacts.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.154
Did he say how?

41:32.691 --> 41:34.624
No.

41:34.626 --> 41:37.794
Still, it seems our good captain

41:37.796 --> 41:40.230
is in for a lethal surprise.

41:44.769 --> 41:48.771
I thought that you would be more
pleased that your trap has been set.

41:48.773 --> 41:51.241
I...

41:51.243 --> 41:54.244
I'm just a little nervous.

41:54.246 --> 41:57.914
Now that it's all
in motion, I fear...

41:57.916 --> 41:59.883
It's going to work.

41:59.885 --> 42:01.951
It's going to be all right.

42:06.224 --> 42:08.691
Have you ever thought of...

42:08.693 --> 42:12.095
leaving all this behind?

42:12.097 --> 42:13.963
Going home?

42:13.965 --> 42:16.165
- To Scotland?
- Yes.

42:17.936 --> 42:19.802
Yes.

42:19.804 --> 42:22.105
Yes, I admit I have.

42:22.107 --> 42:25.141
This war and my part in it
has proven very different

42:25.143 --> 42:27.010
to what I expected.

42:27.012 --> 42:30.980
Whatever moral certainties
that I naively entertained

42:30.982 --> 42:32.715
have turned to cynicism,

42:32.717 --> 42:36.119
which shames me.

42:36.121 --> 42:40.790
Which makes me all the
more grateful for you.

42:40.792 --> 42:43.293
You're a beacon, Anna,

42:43.295 --> 42:46.663
a light in the darkness

42:46.665 --> 42:49.098
of these past few months.

42:49.100 --> 42:52.302
You're the only person
that I can trust.

42:54.272 --> 42:56.306
( crying )

42:56.308 --> 42:58.808
Oh.

42:58.810 --> 43:01.077
Oh, dear.

43:01.079 --> 43:03.046
Now, now.

43:16.861 --> 43:19.829
