00:15.015 --> 00:16.181
[grunting]

00:17.851 --> 00:19.519
Release these shackles

00:19.602 --> 00:24.315
or I'll wear your spine
as my crown, peasants!

00:24.399 --> 00:27.235
-That's a new one.
-Her creativity knows no bounds.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.487
-[growls]
-[both grunt]

00:29.571 --> 00:30.905
Apologies for my delay.

00:30.989 --> 00:31.865
[grunts]

00:36.161 --> 00:38.663
I was awaiting Aaarrrgghh!!!'s return,
he never showed.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.874
I'm sure he's fine,
we've got bigger problems.

00:40.957 --> 00:44.002
-[growling, biting]
-[shrieks]

00:44.085 --> 00:50.300
[grunts] After I feast on your souls,
agony will rule for a thousand millennia.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.469
How long is a millennia?
Like a million years?

00:52.552 --> 00:53.845
I think it's a thousand.

00:53.928 --> 00:55.138
Indeed, Master Jim.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.557
I would not like my soul
to be feasted upon,

00:57.640 --> 00:59.768
if that's all right
with everybody in the room.

00:59.851 --> 01:00.810
[laughs]

01:00.894 --> 01:04.313
-What's wrong with her?
-She is most certainly possessed.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.355
Does the name Morgana

01:05.440 --> 01:06.858
-mean anything to you?
-[gasps]

01:06.941 --> 01:10.487
You cannot hope to contain me,
trollish whelp.

01:10.570 --> 01:13.156
I am the Eldritch Queen
of the Seventh Plane.

01:13.823 --> 01:19.829
Baba Yaga. The Pale Lady.
I have slain scores of Merlin's fools.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.957
[laughing]

01:23.041 --> 01:24.959
I do know that name!

01:25.043 --> 01:27.754
This is far worse
than I could have ever imagined!

01:30.298 --> 01:32.801
Morgan le Fay, Merlin's apprentice.

01:32.884 --> 01:35.303
Like Merlin who made my Amulet?

01:35.386 --> 01:39.641
I spit on his name as I spit on his grave.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.726
Sounds like they didn't get along.

01:41.810 --> 01:46.231
He thinks he can be rid of me?
The fool. [laughs]

01:46.314 --> 01:51.194
I will erase his name
and all of his creations. [laughs]

01:51.277 --> 01:53.696
The sorcerer and sorceress
dueled for centuries

01:53.780 --> 01:57.575
until Merlin sacrificed himself
to banish her from our world.

01:57.659 --> 01:58.827
But now she's here.

01:58.910 --> 02:02.413
Oh, what little lambs.
My work here is done.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.250
Gunmar knows
how to bring the Eternal Night.

02:05.917 --> 02:10.130
All you can do is sit back
and watch the world as it burns.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.881
-Oh, boy.
-It's not possible.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.676
-With what relics? What magics?
-Blinky!

02:14.759 --> 02:17.095
-[Blinky groans]
-[Morgana humming]

02:17.178 --> 02:19.430
Hi, Madam M. I'm Tobias.

02:19.514 --> 02:20.515
-[growls]
-[screams]

02:20.598 --> 02:23.810
-Can you save Claire?
-If the Eternal Night comes to pass--

02:23.893 --> 02:27.814
-Blinky, can you save Claire?
-I cannot.

02:27.897 --> 02:30.775
-I think I know someone who can.
-[Toby shrieking]

02:30.859 --> 02:32.861
[theme music playing]

02:40.702 --> 02:41.661
[roaring]

02:56.634 --> 02:57.677
[roars]

03:03.308 --> 03:06.269
[wolves howling]

03:06.352 --> 03:09.230
-[liquid splashing]
-[groans] Darn it.

03:13.359 --> 03:18.573
-[Toby screaming]
-[banging]

03:20.700 --> 03:22.452
Morgana, in the flesh.

03:22.535 --> 03:26.289
-[Morgana laughing]
-Well, that flesh isn't hers,

03:26.372 --> 03:30.877
so if you would be so kind, do tell us
how to get her out of that poor girl!

03:31.669 --> 03:32.921
[Toby sobbing]

03:33.004 --> 03:35.965
Dim dock, Sa-tu lark...

03:36.049 --> 03:36.925
[screams, grunts]

03:40.136 --> 03:41.638
The Book of Ga-Huel.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.474
You were reluctant
to dabble in dark magics.

03:44.557 --> 03:49.896
-I fear now you are neck deep in it.
-Traitorous impure! I made you!

03:49.979 --> 03:51.522
-How do we fix her?
-Hmm.

03:51.606 --> 03:54.108
Dealing in dark magiks is never easy.

03:54.192 --> 03:57.779
There is always a cost,
though I fear we have no other choice.

03:57.862 --> 04:02.116
-We all want to save Claire, don't we?
-Go on with it.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.036
Morgana is using her as a vessel,
a puppet,

04:05.119 --> 04:07.372
a toehold into our plane of reality.

04:07.455 --> 04:11.084
But how? Where is the real Claire?

04:11.167 --> 04:12.001
[growls]

04:12.669 --> 04:16.047
-[gasps] She doesn't have a shadow.
-No shadow?

04:19.050 --> 04:23.096
-Dude.
-Of course! The Skathe-Hrün!

04:23.179 --> 04:26.599
The Shadow Staff!
It is a relic of Morgana.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.643
-What are you trying to say?
-[snarls]

04:28.726 --> 04:29.852
[all gasp]

04:29.936 --> 04:32.355
Morgana is the Mistress of Shadows.

04:32.438 --> 04:35.900
She doesn't cast a shadow
because she is a shadow.

04:35.984 --> 04:39.404
Claire's spirit is trapped
in the space between worlds.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.364
-The Shadow Realm!
-[growls]

04:41.447 --> 04:44.409
 -How do we get her back?
-There is only one way.

04:44.492 --> 04:47.287
Someone must find her spirit
in the Shadow Realm

04:47.370 --> 04:48.997
and return it to her body.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.581
But we must do so quickly.

04:50.665 --> 04:54.669
The longer Morgana stays in her,
the stronger the hold on Claire.

04:54.752 --> 04:59.966
[laughs] You will never find her!
You will meet your death first.

05:00.049 --> 05:02.969
-I'll do it.
-Not alone, Jimbo. Claire's my friend too.

05:03.052 --> 05:05.305
Then I will stay back
to conjure the portal.

05:05.388 --> 05:08.266
It will remain open
for as long as I hold the staff.

05:08.349 --> 05:11.269
You mean we will stay.
You two find Claire and get back.

05:11.352 --> 05:15.523
I will keep all my six eyes on you,
on both of you!

05:15.606 --> 05:17.608
[suspenseful music playing]

05:21.654 --> 05:23.489
[grunts]

05:23.573 --> 05:26.284
Merlin dead. Staff lost.

05:26.367 --> 05:32.373
But what is lost can be found.
She told me who will show me the way.

05:32.582 --> 05:33.583
Why bring me?

05:33.666 --> 05:37.045
When we arrive, all will become clear.

05:37.128 --> 05:42.008
Don't worry, you shall serve
your warlord one last time.

05:43.259 --> 05:45.928
-[grunting]
-Mm-hmm.

05:48.347 --> 05:50.099
We brought everything you asked.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.560
And some tacos!
You didn't ask for those, but--

05:52.643 --> 05:56.939
-Did you bring the emotional anchor?
-Here. She's had it since she was a baby.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.900
Perfect. It will lead you to her.

05:58.983 --> 06:03.654
When you cross over,
speak the incantation "Modus Occul-Takh."

06:03.738 --> 06:07.366
-Modu-- Modus Ocultahm.
-Modus Occul-Takh.

06:07.450 --> 06:11.162
Perfect. Once you get Claire,
to return, use the rabbit again

06:11.245 --> 06:13.956
and say the incantation in reverse.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.626
[stammering]

06:16.709 --> 06:18.503
Hkat-Lucco Sudom.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.880
-[both] Hkat-Lucco Sudom.
-Got it.

06:21.589 --> 06:24.967
We haven't much time. We must act now,
or she may be lost forever.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.052
The staff!

06:35.478 --> 06:37.188
Claire always made it look so easy.

06:37.271 --> 06:38.439
Remember, Master Jim,

06:38.523 --> 06:42.568
the Shadow Realm is a plane of chaos,
devoid of light or reason.

06:42.652 --> 06:46.531
-Spare no time.
-[Strickler] Come on. Come on. Come on.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.201
[Morgana snarls]

06:50.910 --> 06:52.245
Let's bring her home.

06:54.163 --> 06:56.207
Deya, guide them.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.752
[both screaming]

07:03.172 --> 07:05.174
[screams]

07:05.716 --> 07:06.884
[screams]

07:12.682 --> 07:15.393
-Tobes, you can breathe.
-[gasping]

07:15.476 --> 07:17.895
[takes deep breath]

07:17.979 --> 07:19.939
-This is nuts, Jim!
-[rumbling]

07:20.022 --> 07:20.940
Whoa!

07:23.651 --> 07:24.986
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

07:25.653 --> 07:28.781
[grunts] You might wanna hold
onto Suzy Snooze.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.867
Modus Occul-Takh.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.415
[squeaks, beeps]

07:40.918 --> 07:42.128
-[squeaks]
-[both gasp]

07:42.712 --> 07:43.546
[squeaks]

07:46.507 --> 07:47.717
What the...?

07:47.800 --> 07:49.802
[both screaming]

07:56.017 --> 07:58.019
Wait. Was that Claire's couch?

08:04.609 --> 08:07.320
-Is that Claire's house?
-[squeaks]

08:12.158 --> 08:13.075
[Toby whimpering]

08:16.287 --> 08:18.247
[Toby] Um... uh...

08:26.547 --> 08:28.132
[Toby whimpering]

08:30.218 --> 08:31.719
[creaking]

08:46.734 --> 08:49.028
-[Jim gasps]
-I'm scared, Jim.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.698
-[screams]
-[growling]

08:53.074 --> 08:54.951
That's our stone!

08:55.034 --> 08:57.870
-We need that to save my brother!
-Claire!

09:00.081 --> 09:03.793
-Oh, no!
-I can't. It won't work.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.711
[shouts]

09:05.795 --> 09:06.921
[grunts]

09:07.004 --> 09:08.422
It's killing her!

09:09.131 --> 09:11.592
Jim, don't let them do this to you.

09:12.677 --> 09:15.054
-[Jim screaming]
-Jim, no!

09:15.846 --> 09:17.557
[Claire] Jim, no.

09:18.474 --> 09:22.395
I got a bad feeling about this place, man.

09:22.478 --> 09:23.312
...be ours!

09:26.566 --> 09:30.236
-[growling]
-[creaking]

09:31.153 --> 09:32.238
[banging]

09:32.321 --> 09:34.240
[baby crying]

09:38.035 --> 09:39.328
Claire?

09:41.080 --> 09:43.040
Claire, are you in here?

09:43.708 --> 09:45.626
[baby continues crying]

09:48.879 --> 09:53.259
-[groans] Ugh. Sweaty palms.
-What? I'm scared.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.722
[whimpering]

09:59.223 --> 10:01.601
[baby crying]

10:01.684 --> 10:03.102
Enrique?

10:05.521 --> 10:06.897
[both gasp]

10:06.981 --> 10:09.525
Enrique! Mi hermanito. Shh.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.526
[baby crying]

10:10.610 --> 10:11.944
-There, there.
-Claire?

10:12.695 --> 10:14.405
Claire, are you okay?

10:15.072 --> 10:16.699
-So much to do.
-Claire!

10:16.782 --> 10:19.327
Mom and Dad will be so mad
if I don't finish it all.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.245
 Calculus homework, band practice...

10:21.329 --> 10:23.497
-Aah!
-I gotta be the best daughter.

10:23.581 --> 10:26.751
Mom needs me to be good.
Can't cause trouble for the campaign.

10:26.834 --> 10:30.212
Claire! Claire!
We're in the Bizarro Zone! Wake up!

10:30.296 --> 10:31.714
[baby sucking pacifier]

10:36.469 --> 10:39.055
[Claire] Ah. Shh.

10:39.138 --> 10:39.972
This is bad.

10:40.056 --> 10:43.142
How are we supposed to get her back
if she doesn't know she's gone?

10:47.938 --> 10:49.440
[grunts]

10:49.523 --> 10:52.526
Why haven't they returned?
You've sent those boys to their doom.

10:52.610 --> 10:55.863
The Realm of Shadows
does not operate by our rules.

10:55.946 --> 10:57.948
Give them time. Have faith.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.660
I have faith... in them.

11:00.743 --> 11:06.248
[chuckles] Oh, it must be heart-wrenching
to see your pupil

11:06.332 --> 11:08.459
turn to another for guidance.

11:08.542 --> 11:12.088
Spare me, witch!
Your words are useless on me.

11:12.171 --> 11:16.592
I spot a pattern.
Even your own brother turned against you.

11:16.675 --> 11:19.136
-Who can blame him? [laughs]
-[grunts]

11:20.471 --> 11:23.933
-[sighs] Where are you going?
-To find a gag!

11:24.016 --> 11:27.895
Oh, the poor soul stands
in the presence of his Lady Creator,

11:27.978 --> 11:30.564
but insists on siding with babes.

11:30.648 --> 11:34.068
You expect that feeble boy
to be your savior

11:34.151 --> 11:36.320
when a deity is before you?

11:36.404 --> 11:39.031
I don't deny who you are,

11:39.115 --> 11:42.535
but I choose to believe
there's a better way!

11:43.786 --> 11:45.162
[grunts]

11:45.246 --> 11:49.750
[Morgana] I know your heart, Stricklander.
You desire power.

11:50.292 --> 11:53.462
Changelings aren't equals.
They are better.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.714
I've heard all this before.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.050
But I can offer something more.

12:00.177 --> 12:01.095
[gasps]

12:01.178 --> 12:03.055
The heart of another.

12:06.725 --> 12:08.310
Mm. Mm-hmm.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.439
[Strickler] Nice try. She's done with me.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.941
[Morgana] I can bend her will.

12:14.024 --> 12:19.071
I will make her fall in love with you
despite the monster that you are.

12:19.155 --> 12:22.450
All you have to do is drop the staff...

12:23.451 --> 12:25.411
and seal their fate.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.540
Strickler, no! Don't listen to her!

12:30.499 --> 12:32.710
Aah! Oh!

12:33.335 --> 12:34.462
No!

12:41.719 --> 12:42.636
[grunts]

12:43.220 --> 12:45.848
Now, it's just you and me.

12:46.515 --> 12:49.101
[shouting] Can you hear me?!

12:49.185 --> 12:51.520
Blink if you can hear me!

12:51.604 --> 12:52.855
[gasps] She blinked!

12:52.938 --> 12:55.566
Finals are tomorrow. Can't fall behind.

12:55.649 --> 12:58.527
She can't hear us, Tobes.
We can't even drag her out.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.279
Well, if we don't get out of here,

13:00.362 --> 13:02.823
Claire might have
some permanent roommates.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.825
-That's us, Jim!
-Yeah, I got it.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.995
Claire! Claire!

13:08.078 --> 13:10.539
[sighs] This is pointless!
It's not working.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.625
[grunts]

13:12.708 --> 13:13.542
[gasps]

13:13.918 --> 13:16.378
Jim! The books! The books!
She saw them fall!

13:16.462 --> 13:19.048
Must keep studying. Finals are tomorrow.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.800
-[gasps]
-Dude! Do it again!

13:21.884 --> 13:25.137
-I'll do one better.
-[gasps] Uh...

13:27.056 --> 13:29.683
Mm. Ay-yay-yay. [grunts]

13:30.392 --> 13:35.272
-She has to read it. Make her read it.
-Read it, Claire. Read it!

13:35.356 --> 13:38.067
Stay away from me. Leave me alone.

13:38.150 --> 13:43.489
"Claire, this isn't real.
It's us, Jim and Toby. Wake up."

13:43.572 --> 13:46.951
-[Toby] Claire! We're here!
-[gasps]

13:48.911 --> 13:51.038
[Jim] Claire. We're here.

13:51.121 --> 13:55.709
Claire, we're here!

13:55.793 --> 13:58.796
-Claire, see us? Come on, right here.
-We're right here. Whoo-hoo!

13:58.879 --> 14:00.297
Claire, do you see us?

14:00.381 --> 14:03.425
I know. I see you.
What are you two even doing here?

14:03.509 --> 14:04.343
[both gasp]

14:05.219 --> 14:07.346
-She can see us!
-She sees us! She sees us!

14:07.429 --> 14:10.015
What? Why is everything so weird?

14:10.599 --> 14:15.354
And why am I see-through?
Holy shish-kebab! I'm dead!

14:15.437 --> 14:17.565
You're not dead.
It's kinda hard to explain.

14:17.648 --> 14:19.024
Allow me. [inhales deeply]

14:19.108 --> 14:21.652
You're a ghost in a ghost house
in a crazy shadow space,

14:21.735 --> 14:24.822
we gotta get you back to fight
a sorceress who hijacked your body.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.199
Plus, I think she's been dead
for a few centuries.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.410
Morgana! I'm gonna kill her!

14:29.493 --> 14:31.996
Slow down. Let's get you back first.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.540
Oh, there! There it is!

14:34.623 --> 14:36.125
[Claire] That's a long way.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.711
As long as we hold onto this,
we'll get there together.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.212
Suzy Snooze!

14:41.755 --> 14:43.007
[chuckles]

14:43.090 --> 14:44.758
Jim, say the magic words!

14:44.842 --> 14:46.844
Helkat-Luccho Sudom.

14:49.513 --> 14:52.182
-No, no, you have to say them backwards!
-I am!

14:52.266 --> 14:53.434
Hkat-Lucca Sudom!

14:53.517 --> 14:58.731
No, no, Jim. It's... hot-local-sumo...
Oh, my gosh! We totally forgot it!

14:58.814 --> 15:00.983
-You forgot it?
-We were in a rush.

15:01.066 --> 15:04.403
-[Toby] I thought you knew it!
-It's hard enough just saying it forwards!

15:04.486 --> 15:07.823
Okay, so we'll do it the hard way.
Take us home, Suzy!

15:07.907 --> 15:09.909
[Toby screaming]

15:13.454 --> 15:15.289
-[Blinky] Strickler!
-[pounding on door]

15:15.372 --> 15:17.499
Her heart will be yours.

15:17.583 --> 15:21.337
All you have to do is let go of the staff.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.964
All I have to do is let go.

15:24.048 --> 15:28.886
But I've come to learn
that a stolen heart...

15:28.969 --> 15:32.514
[grunts] is never truly yours!

15:32.598 --> 15:37.937
All you have to do is let go of the staff.

15:47.321 --> 15:50.366
What Faustian bargain
did you make with the witch?

15:50.449 --> 15:54.787
I said "no," you idiot!
Now, where is that gag?

15:55.621 --> 15:58.666
Azazazuth-Kinekh-Thoon!

15:58.749 --> 15:59.833
[Blinky grunts]

16:00.668 --> 16:02.002
-Aah!
-[growls]

16:05.506 --> 16:10.052
I am your doom! [laughs]

16:12.638 --> 16:14.848
Oh, no! Where'd the light go?

16:14.932 --> 16:17.393
That was our way home! We're sealed in!

16:17.476 --> 16:19.228
[Claire] Look! My staff!

16:19.311 --> 16:21.522
Get it! It's our only way back!

16:21.605 --> 16:23.983
-Toby! Don't let go!
-[screaming]

16:28.112 --> 16:28.988
[grunts]

16:42.376 --> 16:43.919
[laughs]

16:46.588 --> 16:49.008
-Yes!
-[growls]

16:49.091 --> 16:50.759
[yelling]

16:52.177 --> 16:53.429
[laughs]

16:59.643 --> 17:01.186
She's controlling the staff!

17:01.770 --> 17:03.230
[growls]

17:03.313 --> 17:07.734
She's growing too powerful!
We must stop her!

17:07.818 --> 17:10.945
-How would you suggest we do that?
-[grunts]

17:11.030 --> 17:12.489
Aah! Don't you dare!

17:12.573 --> 17:17.869
We must! We've already lost two!
How many more deaths will be on our hands?

17:17.953 --> 17:19.413
[laughs]

17:19.997 --> 17:24.710
Don't you get it? Claire's gone!
They're not coming back!

17:24.792 --> 17:26.336
We don't know that!

17:26.420 --> 17:30.215
This is Morgana! The Morgana!

17:30.299 --> 17:32.760
We mustn't! We can't!

17:32.843 --> 17:35.262
[laughing]

17:41.935 --> 17:43.771
It's too fast! How do we catch it?

17:51.487 --> 17:53.530
Azazazuth-Kinekh-Thoon!

17:54.782 --> 17:55.699
[growls]

17:55.783 --> 17:56.950
[Jim] What are you doing?

17:57.034 --> 18:00.412
I don't know.
These words, they're in my head.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.956
Azazazuth-Kinekh-Thoon!

18:09.880 --> 18:13.258
[groans] She's stronger than me!

18:14.968 --> 18:17.221
-[gasps]
-Stand aside!

18:17.304 --> 18:20.224
I will not let you harm that girl!

18:20.307 --> 18:22.768
Azazazuth-Kinekh-Thoon!

18:24.186 --> 18:25.687
[growls]

18:26.855 --> 18:29.149
Azazazuth-Kinekh-Thoon!

18:29.233 --> 18:30.734
You don't control me!

18:30.818 --> 18:34.446
Get out of my head, child! [growling]

18:34.530 --> 18:36.073
-Forgive me, Claire.
-No!

18:36.448 --> 18:38.492
But it must be done.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.369
[whimpering]

18:42.496 --> 18:45.374
Azazazuth-Kinekh-Thoon!

18:48.168 --> 18:53.632
You dare wield a weapon of my power?
My Skathe-Hrün will be your end!

18:53.715 --> 18:59.138
It's not yours anymore. I made it mine.
And now I'm taking it back.

18:59.221 --> 19:02.099
Okay, Suzy Snooze, it's you and I.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.728
-[roaring]
-[screaming]

19:11.650 --> 19:12.568
[screaming]

19:14.987 --> 19:16.155
[screaming]

19:21.535 --> 19:26.039
-[Toby] What's happening?
-Grab onto the staff!

19:38.552 --> 19:42.097
[panting] We're alive! We're alive!

19:43.765 --> 19:45.267
[objects clattering]

19:47.352 --> 19:49.021
[sighs, gasps]

19:49.104 --> 19:50.772
[screams]

19:51.356 --> 19:54.067
-Claire!
-Were you gonna stab me with that thing?

19:54.151 --> 19:55.194
-No!
-Yes!

19:55.277 --> 19:59.031
-Obviously, we were--
-Going to break your chains!

19:59.114 --> 20:00.824
-Ha!
-Claire, that was--

20:00.908 --> 20:05.370
We were around the world in zero seconds!
And you, you out-witched a witch!

20:05.454 --> 20:08.123
Is she still... there?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.791
No. She's...

20:10.375 --> 20:12.419
[sighs] gone.

20:12.502 --> 20:17.507
But while she was under my skin...
I was in her head. I remember things.

20:20.469 --> 20:21.970
-That's new.
-Curious.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.765
Not only did you overcome
a 12th-century sorceress,

20:24.848 --> 20:27.893
but it appears you've picked up
a few of her tricks.

20:27.976 --> 20:29.978
I don't know if it's enough to stop her.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.648
Plus, Morgana told Gunmar
how to bring the Eternal Night.

20:32.731 --> 20:37.527
And if he does, I got a bad feeling
this won't be the last we see of her.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.280
[thunder rumbling]

20:47.496 --> 20:49.623
She led us true.

20:49.706 --> 20:54.169
Aysa-Thoon, the Temple of the Pale One.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.972
The Temple of the Dark One.

21:05.555 --> 21:08.809
Morgana's magic is strong here.

21:08.892 --> 21:11.895
It weakens the walls of her prison.

21:26.493 --> 21:32.374
You brought the fallen Gumm-Gumm.
He shall become bait.

21:32.457 --> 21:38.046
Hmm. Pale Lady, the eye of Angor Rot.

21:38.505 --> 21:39.965
[Morgana] My champion.

21:40.632 --> 21:43.927
Centuries ago,
you came to me on your knees.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.721
I granted you power.

21:45.804 --> 21:49.474
In return, you served me faithfully.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.561
Take your soul back and a tad of my own

21:52.644 --> 21:53.937
 and live again.

22:04.364 --> 22:08.952
You shall serve me once more, Angor Rot.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.747
Yes, my lady.

22:11.830 --> 22:16.251
This time, I will destroy them all.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.753
[screams]

22:18.962 --> 22:21.506
[laughs]
