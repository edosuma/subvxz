WEBVTT

00:00.042 --> 00:00.042
23.976

00:03.670 --> 00:08.717
Harry throws it in gear, floors the gas, and backs us right through a burrito stand.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.636
So, when are you going to teach me how to drive?

00:12.304 --> 00:13.138
You sure you're ready?

00:14.097 --> 00:16.475
I've piloted Starships. I think I can handle a car.

00:17.267 --> 00:21.230
Ah, you'd be surprised. The clutch on a '69 Mustang can be pretty tricky.

00:22.773 --> 00:26.193
Take a look. She's watching us again.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.570
She's working. Relax.

00:29.696 --> 00:30.447
Dessert?

00:31.865 --> 00:32.366
What is it?

00:32.950 --> 00:36.620
Some cheese I prepared for our Kadi guest. Tell me what you think.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.169
It's a little bland.

00:44.586 --> 00:50.175
Just a little? Oh, that's bad. The Kadi don't approve of spices. Anything that might inflame the senses.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.177
You're talking this mission very seriously.

00:52.761 --> 00:58.517
The Kadi are easily offended. The Captain's leaving their representative entirely in my hands while she's at the colony.

00:59.017 --> 01:01.061
I'm sure you're up to it, Ambassador.

01:01.562 --> 01:02.229
I hope so.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.316
She's watching us again.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.610
You're imagining things.

01:09.152 --> 01:09.903
I don't think so.

01:10.863 --> 01:11.530
B'Elanna!

01:14.700 --> 01:15.909
Enjoying the view?

01:16.326 --> 01:16.743
Explain.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.163
You've been staring at us all night.

01:20.205 --> 01:24.042
In fact, you were following us yesterday when we were walking to Engineering

01:24.084 --> 01:27.212
and the day before when I was waiting for Tom outside the shuttle bay.

01:27.880 --> 01:33.051
You are correct, I have been observing you. It's part of my research on human mating behaviour.

01:36.430 --> 01:43.937
Stardate 52647, fourteen hours. Subjects quarrel in corridor outside female's quarters.

01:43.979 --> 01:51.820
Male returns with twelve flowering plant stems, species rosa rubifolia, effecting a cessation of hostilities.

01:51.862 --> 01:57.784
Stardate 52648, oh three hundred hours. Intimate relations resume.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.287
How the hell do you know when we're having intimate relations?

02:00.621 --> 02:04.374
There is no one on deck nine section twelve who doesn't know when you're having intimate relations.

02:04.708 --> 02:05.501
Is there a problem?

02:05.834 --> 02:07.586
I want all the data you've collected.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.505
I haven't completed the study.

02:09.713 --> 02:14.009
Then study this. Borg provokes Klingon, Klingon breaks Borg nose.

02:14.801 --> 02:15.344
B'Elanna!

02:15.886 --> 02:18.764
Call Sickbay. Tell them there's about to be a medical emergency.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.057
B'Elanna, let's go have a nightcap.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.017
This time you've crossed the line.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:17.548 --> 04:20.594
I read B'Elanna's report. Needless to say, I was surprised.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.888
I was careful not to violate protocols.

04:23.138 --> 04:26.308
That's not the point. This is a starship, not a nature preserve.

04:28.393 --> 04:28.936
Oh, I'm missing a pip.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.980
You asked me to broaden my knowledge of human behaviour.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.691
I'm not questioning your goals, Seven.

04:34.733 --> 04:39.363
It's your methods. Shouldn't be taking field notes on the crew. Help me with this, will you please?

04:42.866 --> 04:46.703
Have you ever considered trying it yourself? Romance, I mean.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.624
I do not require a romantic relationship.

04:51.708 --> 04:56.630
So why'd you collect thirty thousand gigaquads of information on the subject? I'm late.

05:00.217 --> 05:05.931
I missed this on my first pass through their database. Kadi monks only wash with purified water so sonic showers are out.

05:05.931 --> 05:10.060
I've already equipped his quarters with an ablutionary fountain built to their specifications.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.812
They observe eight daily services.

05:11.854 --> 05:12.479
Noted.

05:12.521 --> 05:18.235
Show the ambassador our best side, Neelix. I don't want him going back to his superiors with tales of how immoral we are.

05:20.863 --> 05:21.405
Energise.

05:31.248 --> 05:31.999
The ritual greeting.

05:34.918 --> 05:42.342
Travellers who have left the sanctity of their home and family, we welcome you into our home, our family.

05:43.927 --> 05:47.389
Accept these symbols of our purity and the goddess mother's blessing.

05:56.190 --> 06:01.987
Commander Tuvok, the senior officer who will accompany me, and Mister Neelix, who will familiarise your Ambassador with Voyager.

06:03.363 --> 06:09.870
Tomin is an excellent judge of character. He'll help us determine whether your crew is worthy of receiving our minerals.

06:10.829 --> 06:11.872
He's in very good hands.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.584
It is time to welcome you to our home.

06:31.808 --> 06:32.684
This way, Ambassador.

06:38.649 --> 06:44.780
Voyager's an Intrepid class Starship with a crew of one hundred and forty six, designed for long-term exploration.

06:44.863 --> 06:48.492
I thought we'd start with a tour of our primary systems. First stop, Engineering.

06:49.952 --> 06:55.290
I was hoping I might sample a food item I noted earlier in your data files. Hasperat.

06:56.291 --> 07:03.006
It's a Bajoran dish, very spicy. I believe that your dietary protocols prohibit flavourful foods.

07:03.549 --> 07:08.804
I want to broaden my palate while I'm here, in the interest of better understanding.

07:09.805 --> 07:11.849
In that case, first stop, Mess hall.

07:14.726 --> 07:20.315
Your cortical implants are operating at peak efficiency. Nanoprobe levels stable. Complaints?

07:20.774 --> 07:21.275
None.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.569
I heard about the Mess hall incident.

07:25.028 --> 07:29.533
This crew can be very efficient at disseminating information when they choose to be.

07:30.409 --> 07:35.581
They say gossip travels faster than warp speed. So why were you studying Tom and B'Elanna?

07:36.874 --> 07:37.833
Scientific curiosity.

07:38.458 --> 07:45.382
Are you sure? Perhaps there's a reason that hasn't occurred to you. You're a woman, Seven.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.093
Is that an observation or a diagnosis?

07:48.510 --> 07:51.972
A simple biological fact, with repercussions that are hard to deny.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.558
What is your proposed treatment.

07:55.559 --> 08:00.564
Perhaps you should consider expanding your research to the realm of dating.

08:01.273 --> 08:03.233
Dating. You mean procreation.

08:03.775 --> 08:10.157
One step at a time. Dating is a human ritual wherein two people share a social activity, get to know each other.

08:10.240 --> 08:15.078
In time, it can lead to a romantic involvement and eventually, if all goes well, even marriage.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.372
One step at a time.

08:18.373 --> 08:22.211
This could be an important stage in your social development. It's worth exploring.

08:23.337 --> 08:28.425
The Captain would seem to agree. How shall I proceed?

08:28.800 --> 08:33.347
You mean, we. I'll prepare a lesson plan. Meet me on Holodeck two in one hour.

08:33.388 --> 08:36.558
Most women start dating a little younger than you but, better late than never.

08:44.483 --> 08:49.905
I've prepared an introduction. I call it Love Amid the Stars.

08:52.407 --> 08:58.247
The Milky Way, home to thousands of humanoid species and countless courtship rituals.

08:59.998 --> 09:03.669
Klingon males initiate courtship by biting the female.

09:03.710 --> 09:12.302
Here we see two Bolians getting to know one another. The courtship rituals of some species remain shrouded in mystery.

09:12.344 --> 09:19.309
For example Species 8472 appears to have as many as five sexes.

09:19.393 --> 09:23.480
Bystanders better keep their distance.

09:23.689 --> 09:30.988
Of course, the species you're most likely to interact with is human, so without further ado, Lesson One. First Contact.

09:31.572 --> 09:38.078
There are any number of ways humans can meet prospective mates. Here we see the chance encounter.

09:39.329 --> 09:42.040
Equally common is the formal introduction.

09:42.124 --> 09:49.840
When first contact is successful romance quickly ensues and, in the happiest of circumstances, procreation.

09:51.633 --> 09:56.638
Here we see how fortress ovum is besieged by countless little warriors.

09:56.847 --> 09:57.681
Doctor! I'm familiar with the phisiological process of sexuality.

10:03.103 --> 10:09.026
Well, then let's skip ahead to the first of the practical exercises. Lesson two.

10:09.151 --> 10:14.573
Encounter in a Public Place. Computer, initiate holo-program Paris three.

10:15.199 --> 10:16.867
Our location?

10:16.950 --> 10:21.330
Chez Sandrine. It's on Earth, in a city called Marseilles.

10:21.413 --> 10:25.834
Ensign Paris whiled away a good portion of his Academy years here,

10:26.043 --> 10:29.379
no doubt to the detriment of his scholastic performance.

10:29.588 --> 10:36.678
Now, pull up a bar stool and pretend you've come here to meet the man of your dreams.

10:40.015 --> 10:40.641
Hi, there.

10:41.683 --> 10:42.518
Hello.

10:43.644 --> 10:44.228
Come here often?

10:44.853 --> 10:45.938
This is my first time.

10:47.022 --> 10:50.025
You must be new in town? How do you like the south of France?

10:51.401 --> 10:54.279
It is very quaint. Exactly as I've always pictured. It.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.198
May I buy you a drink?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.825
I don't require a liquid supplement at this time.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.452
You're not giving this a fair chance

11:01.119 --> 11:02.079
This exercise is pointless.

11:02.746 --> 11:08.043
It may seem pointless, but small talk is a vital dating skill. It helps to establish a rapport with your companion.

11:09.211 --> 11:11.547
Perhaps there's something to be said for assimilation after all.

11:12.965 --> 11:18.929
All right, why don't you try your own approach on that gentleman over there.

11:20.264 --> 11:20.889
Go ahead.

11:22.266 --> 11:22.975
Very well.

11:31.608 --> 11:31.942
Hello

11:32.359 --> 11:32.985
Hello

11:34.111 --> 11:34.987
May I buy you a drink?

11:35.863 --> 11:45.581
Uh Sure. Steven Price, and you are?

11:46.707 --> 11:50.586
Seven of Nine, tertiary adjunct of. You may call me Seven.

11:52.045 --> 11:56.633
Seven. That's an unusual name. Please, have a seat.

12:06.935 --> 12:11.106
Looks like Sandrine's is under new management. Who deleted my pool table?

12:11.815 --> 12:12.816
Shh! School is in session.

12:13.442 --> 12:14.234
More social lessons?

12:15.235 --> 12:17.154
Watch. You might learn something.

12:20.908 --> 12:21.491
Curious jewellery.

12:22.284 --> 12:23.994
It's a Borg implant. I was a drone.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.079
Oh, so then it's a family heirloom.

12:27.706 --> 12:30.125
Borg do not have families. They have unimatrixes.

12:31.293 --> 12:35.297
Well, in that case, why don't you tell me about your unimatrix.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.299
They're hitting it off, don't you think?

12:38.675 --> 12:39.801
He's a hologram.

12:40.677 --> 12:41.345
Your point?

12:42.137 --> 12:45.849
Well, you programmed him to interact with Seven. Real people don't respond the same way.

12:46.350 --> 12:49.019
Under my guidance, she'll be dating real people in no time.

12:50.521 --> 12:55.776
You're teaching Seven how to date? Ha! Talk about the blind leading the blind.

12:57.986 --> 12:59.696
I've had my share of romantic encounters.

13:01.823 --> 13:04.034
Are you implying that Seven couldn't get a date?

13:04.868 --> 13:08.038
Are you kidding? Half the men on this ship would jump at the chance.

13:08.080 --> 13:12.668
But getting a date is one thing, keeping it from turning into a disaster is another.

13:13.043 --> 13:14.920
I have every confidence in her social skills.

13:18.090 --> 13:23.303
Well, fine. Let's say you get her a date. This is the holodeck, the cards are stacked in her favour,

13:23.345 --> 13:28.183
but if you want to really put her to the test you have to do it in the real world, where anything can happen.

13:31.186 --> 13:34.773
Mister Neelix is hosting a reception for the Kadi ambassador on Thursday night.

13:34.857 --> 13:40.529
Not only will Seven arrive with a date, she will have him eating out of the palm of her hand.

13:40.946 --> 13:47.536
Put your latinum where your mouth is. If Seven brings a date to the reception, and leaves with the same date,

13:47.578 --> 13:53.083
on good terms, without causing a diplomatic incident, I will work double shifts in Sickbay for the next month.

13:54.251 --> 13:55.127
And if she fails?

13:55.627 --> 13:56.461
I get a month off.

13:57.296 --> 13:57.880
It's a bet.

14:03.177 --> 14:03.677
Where are you going?

14:04.261 --> 14:07.306
Our small talk is terminated.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.268
I have mastered this exercise. We can proceed to the next.

14:13.145 --> 14:15.772
If I were you I'd start looking for somebody to fill in for me.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.454
One Ktarian pudding.

14:38.795 --> 14:47.054
Mmm. Ah. Mmm. Ah, the texture is so frothy. It seems to be evaporating in my mouth.

14:47.596 --> 14:50.516
The recipe includes a catalytic agent designed to do just that.

14:52.768 --> 14:56.897
If we don't hurry, we'll miss Lieutenant Torres. She's been waiting half an hour.

14:57.856 --> 15:02.569
You're right. Engineering, your warp core. I must see that.

15:07.366 --> 15:12.829
In our society males and females work separately, but I can see the wisdom of your approach.

15:12.871 --> 15:17.125
Promotes a more stimulating environment.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.212
It's time for third prayer.

15:20.754 --> 15:27.803
Yes, it is, but I think I can forego this service and perform the appropriate penance later.

15:27.886 --> 15:35.352
It's more important that I continue exploring your culture. Perhaps another dessert?

15:38.981 --> 15:43.527
Good morning. It's time for lesson three. Getting to Know You.

15:43.902 --> 15:44.444
Elaborate.

15:45.028 --> 15:50.325
The key to finding a compatible partner is learning how to share your interests and goals.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.912
We'll start with hobbies. What do you do with your spare time?

15:54.705 --> 15:55.163
Regenerate.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.544
Ah. Tell me about your tastes, your likes and dislikes!

16:01.128 --> 16:02.838
I dislike irrelevant conversations.

16:03.964 --> 16:07.843
Okay. Which brings us to goals. What do you want out of life?

16:08.635 --> 16:09.386
Perfection.

16:10.304 --> 16:13.807
Perfection is a laudable goal for oneself, but you can't expect it from others.

16:14.725 --> 16:17.060
I learned that lesson myself when I was first activated.

16:17.436 --> 16:24.109
One of the ways I adapted was to pursue interests people could identify with.

16:24.526 --> 16:27.571
Holo-photography, for example. Opera.

16:27.905 --> 16:30.073
Music does have intriguing mathematical properties.

16:30.782 --> 16:34.745
Excellent. Perhaps we can mould this curiosity into an interest.

16:34.786 --> 16:38.999
Something you can share with others. Let's see how much you know.

16:42.336 --> 16:42.920
Here we see.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.839
A basic musical phrase in the major mode.

16:45.923 --> 16:48.967
I've done a preliminary study of the topic.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.011
Sing it for me.

16:59.937 --> 17:04.775
Seven, has anyone ever told you, you have a beautiful voice? It's a true gift.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.069
The gift is from the collective.

17:07.152 --> 17:11.031
A vocal subprocessor designed to facilitate the sonic interface with Borg transponders.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.284
Let's try something a little more challenging.

17:16.537 --> 17:17.538
You are my sunshine?

17:18.288 --> 17:21.625
It's a simple melody from Earth's twentieth century. A good piece for beginners.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.917
Sing

17:25.838 --> 17:34.888
The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping, I dreamed I held you in my arms.

17:35.639 --> 17:41.270
That was flawless, but try putting a little more emotion into it. Like this.

17:41.395 --> 17:57.327
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken and I hung my head and cried. See?

17:57.411 --> 18:00.873
Computer, add instrumental accompaniment.

18:01.081 --> 18:04.918
On to the chorus. Together now

18:06.920 --> 18:16.722
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are grey.

18:16.763 --> 18:27.024
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away.

18:27.107 --> 18:37.492
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. you make me happy when skies are grey.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.912
You'll never know, dear

18:40.495 --> 18:47.961
How much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.433
Seven, I need the data from those last two Astrometric scans.

19:01.808 --> 19:02.267
In a moment.

19:03.977 --> 19:04.937
That looks like the crew manifest.

19:06.605 --> 19:08.565
The Doctor asked me to pick a suitable candidate.

19:09.316 --> 19:09.691
For what?

19:10.692 --> 19:12.653
Lesson ten. The first date.

19:14.571 --> 19:15.447
Your first date?

19:16.073 --> 19:20.118
I've narrowed the list to two crewmen, based on work performance and compatible interests.

19:20.786 --> 19:22.204
I didn't know you had any interests.

19:23.247 --> 19:28.252
Neither did I, but apparently they include astronomy, quantum mechanics and music.

19:29.044 --> 19:30.003
I play the clarinet, you know.

19:31.088 --> 19:32.798
You are not one of the candidates, Ensign.

19:34.341 --> 19:34.675
Oh.

19:37.636 --> 19:40.013
Well, maybe I could help you pick Mister Right.

19:41.849 --> 19:44.351
Ensign Bronowsky, assigned to the Airponics bay.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.728
His work record is flawless and he plays the accordion.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.273
Badly, very badly. He's got no sense of humour.

19:52.109 --> 19:54.069
Lieutenant Chapman, Structural Engineering.

19:55.153 --> 19:55.946
Chapman's a nice guy.

19:57.698 --> 20:01.118
We worked together on an away mission. He seemed efficient.

20:05.581 --> 20:07.708
Robertson, if that's you, I need an isolinear spanner.

20:08.250 --> 20:08.917
It is not.

20:12.671 --> 20:14.673
I apologise, Lieutenant. I didn't mean to startle you.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.260
No, my fault. You need something?

20:18.969 --> 20:24.808
Your presence is required er, rather, it is requested, tonight. Nineteen hundred hours, holodeck two.

20:25.601 --> 20:26.685
Another engineering simulation?

20:27.519 --> 20:28.103
Dinner.

20:29.855 --> 20:30.314
Dinner?

20:31.148 --> 20:32.858
The consumption of nutritional biomatter.

20:33.942 --> 20:40.782
No, I know what dinner is. I just. Are you asking me to join you?

20:41.783 --> 20:45.454
Yes. State your response.

20:47.206 --> 20:49.499
Okay. Yes.

20:51.126 --> 20:52.044
Please be punctual.

20:53.170 --> 20:53.754
I will, thanks.

20:55.172 --> 20:57.758
A dropped tool can be a workplace hazard. Be more careful next time.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.181
Seven! Please state the nature of the medical emergency.

21:04.890 --> 21:05.599
I have a date.

21:20.781 --> 21:21.532
Sorry I'm late.

21:22.032 --> 21:25.994
It's quite all right. In fact, why don't you take the day off? Relax.

21:26.036 --> 21:28.664
Those double shifts are going to take a lot out of you.

21:29.831 --> 21:30.082
Oh?

21:31.291 --> 21:33.877
Seven of Nine has a date tonight. If all goes well, as I'm sure it will,

21:33.919 --> 21:36.088
he'll accompany her to the reception tomorrow.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.007
Who'd she pick?

21:39.758 --> 21:40.509
Lieutenant William Chapman.

21:41.260 --> 21:43.637
Ha! Chapman? Good luck.

21:44.221 --> 21:45.264
What's that supposed to mean?

21:45.889 --> 21:47.349
He's renowned for being nervous around women.

21:47.891 --> 21:47.975
So.

21:49.268 --> 21:53.814
Are you kidding? Seven's dominant personality will have him running for the airlock before dessert.

21:54.356 --> 21:58.193
Seven may seem intimidating, but that's only a reaction to the way people treat her.

21:58.235 --> 22:02.406
In fact, she's an efficient and charming young woman.

22:04.032 --> 22:06.660
Efficient. I'll give you that, but charming?

22:07.911 --> 22:10.330
Most people don't take the time to look beyond her exterior.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.624
Did you know she has a lovely singing voice?

22:13.584 --> 22:17.880
No, I didn't, but then again, I've never asked her to sing for me.

22:18.297 --> 22:19.256
What are you implying?

22:20.674 --> 22:23.343
It sounds like you're getting a little infatuated with your star pupil.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.471
Infatuated? That's absurd.

22:27.931 --> 22:28.932
Whatever you say, maestro.

22:30.309 --> 22:31.310
It was part of the lesson plan!

22:42.863 --> 22:45.449
You're meeting with him in ten minutes, Seven. Why aren't you ready?

22:45.908 --> 22:46.325
I am.

22:46.617 --> 22:50.370
Aren't we forgetting something? Lesson eight, Dress for Success!

22:51.288 --> 22:52.164
My appearance is sufficient.

22:52.998 --> 22:57.669
Sufficient yes, but you could use a little more panache.

22:57.711 --> 22:59.963
Let's start by doing something different with your hair.

23:01.298 --> 23:04.676
I don't have much first-hand experience with this, but,

23:08.430 --> 23:10.557
try shaking your head a little bit.

23:13.769 --> 23:14.603
Is this more appropriate?

23:17.272 --> 23:18.273
Yes.

23:18.315 --> 23:24.821
When I first designed your dermaplastic garment I also tried my hand at some casual attire.

23:24.863 --> 23:27.032
You might want to replicate one of these.

23:27.866 --> 23:28.492
How shall I choose?

23:29.660 --> 23:31.912
I think you'd look very nice in this one.

23:34.540 --> 23:38.043
I am uncertain how to wear such a garment. Assist me.

23:39.294 --> 23:40.879
Oh, I, I, I'm sure you'll manage.

23:40.921 --> 23:44.550
I'll go prepare the Holodeck. Remember, the idea is to have fun tonight.

23:44.633 --> 23:46.343
I'll expect a full report in the morning.

24:15.831 --> 24:16.874
You, you look beautiful.

24:17.499 --> 24:18.458
Thank you

24:18.458 --> 24:20.252
Thank you. You look beautiful as well.

24:23.463 --> 24:27.301
Thank you. Er, would you like to sit down?

24:28.010 --> 24:29.261
Where is our designated location?

24:30.053 --> 24:31.889
Best table in the house.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.104
I wasn't sure you'd actually show up.

24:39.938 --> 24:40.772
I requested your presence.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.984
Well, to be honest, I thought one of my friends put you up to it.

24:54.203 --> 24:54.870
Um, Champagne?

24:55.621 --> 24:57.956
Synthehol impairs my cortical function. Water will suffice.

24:58.665 --> 24:59.666
Mind if I?

25:01.043 --> 25:02.127
Proceed.

25:03.253 --> 25:09.510
I must admit I'm a little nervous.

25:05.756 --> 25:06.465
Elaborate.

25:07.257 --> 25:13.514
Oh, let's just say it's been a long time since I've been out on a date.

25:14.973 --> 25:19.353
I've never been on a date. As a result I am experiencing anxiety as well.

25:20.187 --> 25:21.897
Well, I guess that means we've got something in common.

25:31.240 --> 25:31.782
Garson.

25:35.118 --> 25:37.454
Server, report to this station. We require your assistance.

26:07.901 --> 26:08.235
Problem?

26:09.611 --> 26:10.821
This creature has an exoskeleton.

26:12.322 --> 26:17.119
It's a lobster. They're a delicacy on Earth. Try it.

26:30.257 --> 26:31.842
I will replicate you a new garment.

26:32.467 --> 26:37.514
I'm fine, fine. It's just a little bit of exoskeleton.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.349
Maybe we should order dessert.

26:40.434 --> 26:42.186
You wish to accelerate our social encounter.

26:43.061 --> 26:49.109
No, no, I didn't say that. I'm just, er, I'm having a very interesting evening.

26:49.193 --> 26:52.863
Would you like to dance?

26:54.823 --> 26:57.451
That activity is covered in Lesson thirty five. I haven't reached it yet.

26:59.286 --> 27:02.039
I'm not much of a dancer myself, but it might be fun.

27:03.540 --> 27:03.999
As you wish.

27:15.886 --> 27:26.563
Relax. Try to relax. You seem a little tense.

27:28.148 --> 27:33.695
Relaxation would disrupt my chronographic sequencer. It allows me to maintain synchronous movement with the music.

27:34.613 --> 27:40.244
That's handy but maybe you could ignore your chronographic sequencer and, er, let me lead.

27:47.417 --> 27:48.126
That's better.

28:11.275 --> 28:11.608
You are damaged.

28:12.401 --> 28:14.152
No, I'll be all right.

28:21.034 --> 28:24.830
You've torn a ligament. I'm afraid you'll have to report to Sickbay.

28:24.872 --> 28:28.250
Mister Paris will treat you. No need to mention how this happened.

28:32.045 --> 28:37.426
I had a great time, Seven. Let's do this again, someday.

28:41.722 --> 28:42.306
I have failed.

28:43.390 --> 28:47.728
Nonsense. Even Romeo and Juliet hit a few snags at first.

28:47.769 --> 28:51.231
Besides, Lieutenant Chapman's not the only lobster in the sea.

28:51.481 --> 28:53.192
I wish to terminate our social lessons.

28:53.650 --> 28:56.486
Just because you didn't achieve perfection your first time out,

28:56.528 --> 28:57.946
doesn't mean you should give up.

29:01.033 --> 29:03.243
Dating is a poor means of interaction.

29:03.368 --> 29:06.538
There is far more efficiency in the way you and I communicate.

29:06.580 --> 29:08.373
We say what we mean, simply and directly.

29:09.499 --> 29:14.546
You and I do have a rapport, but we're colleagues. We're not pursuing romance.

29:16.048 --> 29:16.256
No.

29:17.716 --> 29:20.135
I'm certain you'll be able to master these basic skills in short order.

29:21.595 --> 29:23.138
My first date was certainly short.

29:25.182 --> 29:25.766
Was that a joke?

29:26.767 --> 29:28.352
Lesson Six, beguiling banter.

29:28.977 --> 29:30.145
Now you're getting the hang of it.

29:30.187 --> 29:33.482
Perhaps this evening doesn't have to end so abruptly.

29:33.524 --> 29:36.860
This may be a good time to cover Lesson thirty five, Shall We Dance?

29:37.277 --> 29:40.489
Computer, play Someone To Watch Over Me, instrumental only.

29:45.118 --> 29:46.787
We'll begin with some simple steps.

29:47.204 --> 29:51.625
Place your left hand on my shoulder and your right hand in my left.

29:52.835 --> 29:56.505
Now follow me, one step at a time.

30:03.887 --> 30:06.181
Don't worry, I don't have any ligaments to tear.

30:36.211 --> 30:37.588
Another drink!

30:41.925 --> 30:42.509
Ambassador!

30:43.302 --> 30:49.850
Neelix! My friend, my host, my saviour!

30:50.392 --> 30:58.317
Neelix, I want you to meet, Alandra and Tria.

30:59.818 --> 31:00.360
What are you doing?

31:00.944 --> 31:07.409
I'm sampling yet another entree on the menu of pleasure that you have opened up for me.

31:07.910 --> 31:10.621
I checked today's menu, and they're not on it. Coffee, black.

31:11.288 --> 31:15.250
Neelix, I decided to go exploring and I found your holodecks,

31:15.292 --> 31:20.255
where I discovered this little gem still simmering in the memory buffer.

31:21.089 --> 31:23.050
You can explore it later. Right now, we've got to get you to your reception.

31:26.136 --> 31:27.596
Pungent taste. What is it?

31:27.721 --> 31:29.932
Coffee, and there's plenty more where we're going.

31:30.557 --> 31:36.522
No coffee on our colony. Nothing to tempt the appetite of even the most weak-willed novitiate.

31:37.064 --> 31:44.321
Neelix, a confession! I am thinking of leaving the colony, joining Voyager.

31:45.239 --> 31:50.953
I want to throw off my vows and immerse myself in your wonderful culture.

31:51.370 --> 31:53.163
That's just the synthehol talking.

31:53.580 --> 31:58.585
No, I've never been more clear-headed about anything,

31:59.211 --> 32:02.005
and I have you to thank.

32:02.589 --> 32:04.466
That's right. Up. There we go.

32:10.389 --> 32:10.848
Hard at work?

32:11.807 --> 32:13.225
Our lessons have disrupted my duties.

32:14.268 --> 32:16.395
Then I suppose you're too busy to attend the Ambassador's reception.

32:17.437 --> 32:18.272
My presence is not required.

32:18.856 --> 32:22.901
True, but it might be an opportunity for you to apply your newfound social skills.

32:23.902 --> 32:25.237
Lesson eleven, Life of the Party.

32:25.654 --> 32:27.030
Exactly. Join me?

32:28.782 --> 32:29.908
Are you asking me on a date?

32:32.411 --> 32:32.911
I suppose I am.

32:34.162 --> 32:36.582
Then I accept. Is my appearance sufficient?

32:37.332 --> 32:37.875
You look perfect.

32:46.258 --> 32:49.178
How do you bend a hologram's ear? Use a prism.

32:52.181 --> 32:55.225
What did the counsellor say to the hologram? You're projecting.

32:57.477 --> 32:59.938
This humour, it's a revelation.

33:01.815 --> 33:04.818
Are you sure you wouldn't prefer some more coffee?

33:05.611 --> 33:08.280
Coffee. Yes, I'll have that too. Go.

33:13.243 --> 33:16.830
Neelix, is it my imagination or is our guest of honour drunk?

33:17.331 --> 33:20.542
Commander, I tried. I had an itinerary,

33:20.584 --> 33:25.297
I even set up a prayer dais in his quarters, but I just couldn't control him.

33:25.964 --> 33:28.926
The Captain is due back in the morning with the Kadi minister. What do I do?

33:29.843 --> 33:30.552
Pray.

33:38.769 --> 33:40.562
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

33:41.230 --> 33:44.816
Mister Paris, I believe you know Seven of Nine, my date for the evening.

33:45.484 --> 33:46.818
Oh, you don't say?

33:46.902 --> 33:50.531
Well, your last date ended up in Sickbay. I hope this one goes a little smoother.

33:51.698 --> 33:52.574
There's no need to be insulting.

33:53.367 --> 33:56.161
It's all right, Doctor. I believe he is merely engaging in small talk.

33:56.620 --> 33:58.455
May I get either of you gentlemen a drink?

33:59.164 --> 34:01.124
Yes, a gin and tonic with a twist.

34:01.792 --> 34:03.794
You know I don't drink. I don't have the stomach for it.

34:05.546 --> 34:06.630
A well-crafted joke, Doctor.

34:11.217 --> 34:13.594
Impressive. You've actually taught her to be polite.

34:14.804 --> 34:18.016
But, don't think you've won our bet. She was supposed to bring a real date.

34:18.766 --> 34:22.353
Photons and force fields, flesh and blood, why quibble over details.

34:22.396 --> 34:23.938
I'm just as real as any of you.

34:24.481 --> 34:25.858
Where's the funny man?

34:26.567 --> 34:28.860
Mister Tomin, please, why don't, why don't we sit down.

34:29.735 --> 34:33.407
Oh, there he is, there he is. Ensign Paris,

34:33.489 --> 34:35.784
tell us another one of those hologram jokes.

34:36.869 --> 34:38.370
You've been stealing my material?

34:39.079 --> 34:40.289
That guy's so lubricated he'll laugh at anything.

34:41.665 --> 34:44.877
There he is, the Ambassador of humour.

34:46.628 --> 34:48.213
I could use a little help here.

34:49.130 --> 34:53.802
Seven, perhaps now would be a good time to review lesson twenty three, Toast of the Town.

34:55.804 --> 34:56.096
Very well.

35:01.351 --> 35:03.770
Ladies and gentlemen, I require your attention.

35:03.854 --> 35:08.400
May cultural differences encourage us to build bridges of understanding.

35:08.483 --> 35:10.569
To all that makes us unique.

35:19.453 --> 35:21.288
Who is that extraordinary female?

35:21.205 --> 35:22.331
Seven of Nine.

35:22.539 --> 35:23.373
I want to meet her.

35:23.749 --> 35:24.124
Take a number.

35:25.542 --> 35:26.043
That was lovely.

35:26.752 --> 35:27.169
Thank you.

35:27.503 --> 35:30.672
I've got to admit it, you've done wonders. All right, you win.

35:32.090 --> 35:32.633
Win?

35:32.841 --> 35:35.260
I know when I'm licked. You tell me when you want me to start those double shifts.

35:36.094 --> 35:38.722
You made a wager regarding me? Clarify.

35:39.723 --> 35:40.265
It's not what you think.

35:41.433 --> 35:43.560
Um, don't blame him, it was my idea.

35:44.520 --> 35:48.982
I believed your interest in my social development was sincere, not motivated by personal gain.

35:49.525 --> 35:50.400
It was sincere.

35:51.443 --> 35:54.279
Clearly I am not the only one who requires social lessons.

35:55.572 --> 35:57.115
Thank you for a lovely evening.

36:01.453 --> 36:09.044
Hey, why don't we go back to my quarters? I've studied human mating rituals.

36:09.336 --> 36:11.964
Remove your hand or I will remove your arm.

36:17.803 --> 36:21.890
Did you hear what she said to me? I am the guest of honour!

36:22.432 --> 36:25.227
Ambassador, it's been a long day. Maybe you should get some rest.

36:25.519 --> 36:30.065
No! I'm not leaving! I want another drink.

36:41.869 --> 36:44.246
I thought synthehol wasn't supposed to have this effect on people.

36:44.621 --> 36:48.500
Most people. The enzymes that break down synthehol aren't present in his bloodstream.

36:49.418 --> 36:50.669
Can you counteract the effects?

36:51.003 --> 36:53.130
I can synthesize the enzymes, but that'll take days.

36:53.547 --> 36:55.424
Days? The Captain will be back in the morning.

36:56.341 --> 36:56.967
Maybe he needs a cold shower.

36:58.427 --> 37:01.430
If his superiors find him like this he'll be banished from the colony

37:01.513 --> 37:03.307
and our trade agreement will go right out the airlock.

37:03.849 --> 37:05.559
Oh, Seven of mine.

37:06.476 --> 37:09.980
It may be possible to encode some of my nanoprobes to assimilate the synthehol molecules.

37:10.731 --> 37:11.398
Assimilate me!

37:12.482 --> 37:13.609
There may be some adverse effects.

37:14.443 --> 37:14.860
Please.

37:15.319 --> 37:15.986
But it's worth a try.

37:16.737 --> 37:19.573
The Kadi have rules against medical procedures that haven't been sanctified.

37:20.490 --> 37:22.951
I'd say he's already violated a few rules. What's one more?

37:23.452 --> 37:27.456
Either we treat him or he remains intoxicated. You're his caretaker, decide.

37:30.375 --> 37:30.918
Nanoprobes.

37:38.926 --> 37:40.177
I owe you an apology.

37:41.261 --> 37:44.223
Nanoprobe extraction is an insignificant procedure. My systems will adapt.

37:44.806 --> 37:49.228
No, I'm referring to the wager I made with Ensign Paris.

37:49.311 --> 37:54.608
I can see how you might have felt manipulated, but I assure you that was never my intention.

37:57.110 --> 37:57.945
I accept your apology.

38:00.656 --> 38:03.825
I want to make this perfectly clear so there's no room for misunderstanding.

38:03.909 --> 38:09.164
I asked you to go with me to the reception because I enjoy your company.

38:10.999 --> 38:18.131
In fact, over the last few days I feel as though we've grown closer.

38:19.591 --> 38:20.217
Closer?

38:20.968 --> 38:27.432
We've become more than colleagues. We're friends.

38:28.559 --> 38:32.229
Friends. Agreed. I should begin.

38:33.689 --> 38:35.023
Of course.

38:41.572 --> 38:42.531
I'll take over from here.

38:44.241 --> 38:50.664
Mister Paris. Hypothetically, if one develops romantic feelings for another person,

38:50.747 --> 38:55.002
how does one usually go about expressing them? It's for one of Seven's social lessons.

38:56.461 --> 39:00.841
Ah. I recommend the direct approach. Tell the person how you feel.

39:01.758 --> 39:03.135
What if the feelings aren't mutual?

39:04.511 --> 39:06.054
Well, that's the risk you always take.

39:07.097 --> 39:08.265
Oh. Thank you.

39:13.437 --> 39:16.648
Why don't you tell her? Come on, Doc.

39:16.732 --> 39:20.319
It's obvious the Ambassador is not the only one in this room who's intoxicated.

39:20.986 --> 39:23.447
Impossible! She's my student.

39:25.490 --> 39:29.536
A hologram and a Borg? Stranger things have happened. Just look at me and B'Elanna.

39:38.170 --> 39:40.255
Er, could we walk a little slower?

39:40.714 --> 39:41.840
They're due back any minute.

39:42.508 --> 39:44.927
But my throat feels like an ancient parchment.

39:45.093 --> 39:47.721
Can't we go back to Sandrine's for a refreshing glass of.

39:48.263 --> 39:50.807
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

39:51.975 --> 39:53.393
Oh, those doors, they're so loud

39:54.061 --> 39:54.811
You've got a hangover.

39:56.605 --> 40:01.818
Neelix, I don't remember much of last night but, I imagine I might have said some things.

40:02.194 --> 40:05.572
You spoke eloquently, charmed the entire crew, your reception was a success.

40:06.031 --> 40:06.657
Understand?

40:07.074 --> 40:09.868
Yes. Neelix, you've been most patient.

40:10.244 --> 40:13.497
Well, that's my job, and it isn't over yet.

40:17.000 --> 40:17.626
Welcome back.

40:18.210 --> 40:20.003
Good to be home. How's it going?

40:20.796 --> 40:26.385
All systems functioning normally. Ensign Kim detected a minor fluctuation in sensor array, but he took care of it.

40:27.219 --> 40:30.055
I was referring to Ambassador Tomin. Did he enjoy his visit?

40:30.722 --> 40:34.726
Oh, well, well, I would say that he, er, he enjoyed himself immensely.

40:35.811 --> 40:38.105
There are many distractions aboard this vessel.

40:38.647 --> 40:43.068
You didn't indulge in any of their more colourful traditions?

40:43.861 --> 40:44.695
Of course not.

40:45.821 --> 40:48.782
We followed the itinerary that you approved, to the last detail.

40:49.408 --> 40:49.867
Oh, shame.

40:51.159 --> 40:51.869
Your holiness?

40:52.744 --> 40:58.584
It isn't a violation to explore new experiences, as long as you don't make a habit of it.

41:00.043 --> 41:00.878
I see your point.

41:02.087 --> 41:03.755
Shall we conclude our negotiations, Captain?

41:04.631 --> 41:05.090
By all means.

41:05.549 --> 41:06.425
I'll show you to the briefing room.

41:07.134 --> 41:08.635
Good work, Ambassador.

41:21.607 --> 41:22.149
Do you like them?

41:24.067 --> 41:25.569
Species rosa rubifolia.

41:30.824 --> 41:31.742
State your intention.

41:32.576 --> 41:35.746
I wanted to congratulate you on the latest phase of your social development.

41:37.497 --> 41:38.373
Why don't you read the card?

41:44.421 --> 41:45.464
You are my sunshine.

41:48.717 --> 41:54.097
These past few days have been unforgettable.

41:55.432 --> 41:57.476
You've brought light into my life, Seven.

42:00.020 --> 42:01.855
You have developed romantic feelings for me.

42:02.272 --> 42:03.899
It's as if you've become a part of my program..

42:03.982 --> 42:07.653
When we're apart, I, I feel like I'm missing a subroutine.

42:07.736 --> 42:17.162
I, I don't expect you to reciprocate but I wanted you to know how I feel.

42:20.249 --> 42:21.583
Computer, end program.

42:24.294 --> 42:28.799
Enter. Seven.

42:29.508 --> 42:30.384
I wish to speak with you.

42:31.051 --> 42:36.014
What a coincidence. I was hoping to speak with you as well.

42:35.889 --> 42:36.932
Regarding?

42:39.059 --> 42:40.060
You first.

42:46.400 --> 42:47.150
What's this?

42:47.609 --> 42:51.446
It's a medical tricorder. I enhanced its scanning resolution by thirty three percent.

42:52.573 --> 42:54.825
You once stated you desired a more efficient instrument.

42:56.201 --> 42:56.994
I suppose I did.

42:58.745 --> 43:02.875
It is a gift. Lesson twenty two, Thanks for the Memories.

43:05.502 --> 43:06.253
Is it insufficient?

43:07.671 --> 43:11.508
No, no, it's very thoughtful.

43:12.176 --> 43:15.637
I chose to convey my gratitude at this time because I no longer require your assistance.

43:15.721 --> 43:18.765
 It's obvious there are no potential mates for me aboard this vessel.

43:18.932 --> 43:22.728
However, if I encounter a compatible individual in the future, I will again seek your guidance.

43:25.939 --> 43:29.193
Guidance. Of course.

43:30.152 --> 43:31.486
You said you had something to tell me.

43:35.866 --> 43:45.959
I just wanted to say the past few days have been unforgettable.

43:47.294 --> 43:47.878
Thank you.

43:49.338 --> 43:49.630
You're welcome.

43:58.555 --> 44:02.392
Computer, activate holo-program Paris three.

44:41.098 --> 44:48.438
Won't you tell her please to put on some speed, follow my lead,

44:50.190 --> 45:01.118
oh how I need someone to watch over me.
