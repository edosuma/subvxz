WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:06.254
Scarran warriors outnumber
Peacekeeper soldiers...

00:07.633 --> 00:09.589
ten to one.

00:09.677 --> 00:13.545
But if and when they attack,
we will lose, Braca.

00:13.639 --> 00:16.847
Unless we harness a
superior weapon.

00:16.934 --> 00:19.016
Yes.

00:19.103 --> 00:23.847
Wormhole technology. Without
it, the Sebacean race
will be overrun.

00:23.941 --> 00:26.193
Thousands of cycles
of history gone.

00:26.277 --> 00:28.233
What's Talyn doing?

00:28.321 --> 00:30.186
He's aiming at us.
-Frell.

00:30.281 --> 00:32.272
Shut down, Talyn, shut down!
-Start evasive procedures now!

00:34.911 --> 00:36.276
( screaming )

00:36.370 --> 00:37.655
Talyn.

00:38.623 --> 00:42.115
You know what must happen next.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.451
Let us take away your pain.

00:45.588 --> 00:48.330
( powering down )

00:51.552 --> 00:53.338
Synchronize nerve impulses.

00:53.429 --> 00:56.341
Rygel:
We have almost closed the deal.

00:56.432 --> 00:58.013
Put it on.

00:58.100 --> 01:01.137
Those wearing the bracelets
will feel each other's pain.

01:03.773 --> 01:06.890
I don't see another option.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.690
Scorpius has the knowledge
from my brain

01:08.778 --> 01:11.235
and I'm not gonna let him
shaft the universe with it.

01:11.322 --> 01:14.155
I'm going to the
Command Carrier.

01:15.326 --> 01:17.908
I'm going to stop Scorpius.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.323
You're all gonna die.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.377
And now, on Farscape.

01:31.342 --> 01:32.502
Turn back, John.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.629
Shut up, Private.
We're going in.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.335
(explosions)

01:36.430 --> 01:40.139
If Scorpius discovers you
intend to sabotage his
wormhole research,

01:40.226 --> 01:41.932
he'll kill you, John.

01:42.019 --> 01:46.228
And if you perish, so do |.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.397
Thought you wanted to die.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.187
Not anymore.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.270
I want to survive.

01:53.364 --> 01:55.104
Then follow orders.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.570
I'll do my best.

01:58.661 --> 02:00.526
Trust me on that.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.365
Aeryn:
Crichton!

02:06.460 --> 02:09.202
D'Argo and Rygel just reported
in from the Command Carrier.

02:09.297 --> 02:13.256
Scorpius is sending Marauders
to escort us in.

02:13.342 --> 02:16.960
Or blast us into particles.
-Why is your hair red?

02:17.054 --> 02:20.012
Because I'm anxious, okay?
I don't know why we're
doing this.

02:20.099 --> 02:21.509
I don't know why I came along,

02:21.600 --> 02:24.012
and I don't know why we
didn'tjump ship when
you said we would.

02:24.103 --> 02:25.889
'Cause we'd be nowhere near
a populated planet.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.641
You know what, we could have
stayed on Moya.

02:27.732 --> 02:29.768
Crichton:
Aeryn, turn the Pod around.
Let's take these two back.

02:29.859 --> 02:31.770
Moya is over four arns away.

02:31.861 --> 02:34.318
And hiding with Talyn by now.

02:34.405 --> 02:36.270
Crichton:
Pilot, are you parked?

02:36.365 --> 02:41.325
Pilot:
Yes, Moya has towed Talyn to the
agreed upon rendezvous point.

02:41.412 --> 02:44.245
(groans and electrical surges)

02:46.959 --> 02:48.460
Pilot, what was that?

02:48.544 --> 02:52.002
Moya is under great stress.

02:52.590 --> 02:54.000
She ought to see us.

02:54.091 --> 02:57.754
But she assures me
she will endure.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.756
I hope we can say the same.

03:53.275 --> 03:54.435
Welcome.

04:13.838 --> 04:15.419
Let's test the jewelry.

04:15.506 --> 04:17.212
All right.

04:18.217 --> 04:19.047
Ow!

04:19.135 --> 04:20.921
( groans )

04:24.849 --> 04:26.635
Just checking.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.559
Treating you all right?

04:34.650 --> 04:35.981
So far.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.933
Food could be better.

04:40.281 --> 04:41.737
John Crichton.

04:44.076 --> 04:48.365
I grant you, John, and
your companions full
diplomatic rights,

04:48.456 --> 04:53.701
immunities and courtesies
whilst aboard this vessel.

05:01.010 --> 05:03.296
At last.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.719
The rift between us
is finally bridged.

05:19.195 --> 05:21.607
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

05:21.697 --> 05:25.406
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

05:25.493 --> 05:27.074
I'm trying to stay alive...

05:27.161 --> 05:29.072
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

05:29.163 --> 05:31.870
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.413
If you can hear me...
Beware.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.492
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

05:35.586 --> 05:38.293
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

05:38.380 --> 05:42.840
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless,
for the nightmares I've seen.

05:42.927 --> 05:45.259
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

05:45.346 --> 05:47.803
Not show them...
You exist...

05:47.890 --> 05:51.599
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

06:31.976 --> 06:33.716
So tell me John,

06:33.811 --> 06:36.268
what finally brought you here?

06:36.355 --> 06:41.440
Dominar Rygel claimed you
prefer the Peacekeepers
to the Scarrans.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.105
Any other reasons?

06:44.196 --> 06:47.984
Moya, Pilot, Aeryn, D'Argo.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.817
they've been through hell,
in large part due to me.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.744
It's time I did something
for them.

06:53.831 --> 06:56.117
Do not screw with them,
Scorpius.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.914
Give them what they want.

06:58.002 --> 06:59.333
It's a good deal for you.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.081
Oh,

07:01.171 --> 07:03.127
uncontested.

07:03.215 --> 07:05.171
Crais:
There is one thing
more we want.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.295
Talyn is presently inoperative.

07:07.386 --> 07:10.753
He needs to be brought aboard
for a full cognitive system
replacement.

07:10.848 --> 07:13.089
That was not part of
the agreement.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.719
So?

07:14.810 --> 07:18.302
You called off the Retrieval
Squad. Fixing up Talyn
is chump change.

07:18.397 --> 07:21.264
Braca:
Bringing a gunship aboard
is too much to ask.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.394
His weapons have been
deactivated.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.568
Techs will remove them.
He will be reprogrammed
and set free.

07:26.655 --> 07:30.819
No guns, no Peacekeeper
memories, no emotional
problems.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.699
What incentive is there for
us to work on? Crais'...

07:35.789 --> 07:37.529
Braca, you wanna go
another round with me?

07:37.625 --> 07:40.162
We can take this outside.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.451
Talyn's behalf.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.082
Crais can go to hell.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.334
This is for me, not him.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.216
Granted.

07:50.304 --> 07:53.091
Then show me to my quarters and
get me the project schematics

07:53.182 --> 07:55.298
so I can isolate Talyn's
design flaws.

07:55.392 --> 08:00.136
I'll need a Leviathan
specialist. | request
Lieutenant Larell.

08:00.230 --> 08:04.439
For, uh, any particular reason?

08:04.526 --> 08:07.233
Only that she's the
best qualified.

08:11.367 --> 08:12.777
Hmm.

08:19.416 --> 08:26.037
Your shipmates have been invited
to refreshment in the...
Officer's Lounge.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.291
Shall we join them?

08:27.383 --> 08:29.965
No, thank you. I came to work.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.257
For or against me?

08:34.348 --> 08:37.385
Full immunity for
escaped prisoners.

08:37.476 --> 08:39.137
lt's frelling madness.

08:39.228 --> 08:41.970
We shouldn't be welcoming
these criminals.

08:42.064 --> 08:45.101
We should be executing them.

09:01.417 --> 09:03.658
Make yourselves comfortable.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.256
Traitor.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.308
Deserter.
-Frelljek.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.731
There's a lot of hostility
among the crew.

09:27.818 --> 09:31.231
They feel you betrayed them
by misusing your command.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.483
SodoL

09:33.574 --> 09:35.360
Check the frelljek.

09:35.451 --> 09:37.032
Traitor.

09:37.411 --> 09:38.992
A deserter.

09:42.249 --> 09:45.537
I'm delighted to have
you assisting us.

09:45.627 --> 09:48.619
We've prepared you
a workstation.

09:48.714 --> 09:53.083
Tell me what you require.
I'll have someone obtain
it for you.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.757
Workstation?

10:13.238 --> 10:15.194
I don't assist.

10:15.282 --> 10:18.866
John, the intention...
-Screw you and your
intentions, Scorp!

10:18.952 --> 10:21.068
I do not eat at the
kiddie table.

10:21.163 --> 10:24.280
Now, you either give me the big
toys or you send me home.

10:28.504 --> 10:32.793
Braca:
Not as salubrious as your
previous accommodations.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.295
Still, considering the fact you
should be in our brig,

10:35.385 --> 10:37.341
I suppose you can't complain.

10:39.723 --> 10:42.180
Don't bother searching
for surveillance.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.679
You're not that important.

10:46.772 --> 10:51.391
Lieutenant Braca, I predicted
your rise in this organization.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.521
I stand by that prediction.

10:54.947 --> 10:59.236
You are a consummate
Peacekeepeh

11:07.584 --> 11:09.620
This is too weird being here.

11:10.963 --> 11:13.625
How long were you a prisoner?
-Eight cycles.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.843
And you were born here? Grew up
within these walls? It must
have been awful.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.384
(laughing)

11:20.889 --> 11:22.550
Yeah!

11:22.641 --> 11:23.505
( groans )

11:23.600 --> 11:25.261
That's just chance.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.341
I'll get it back.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.563
(laughing)

11:28.647 --> 11:30.012
Cheers.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.687
No, it wasn't awful.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.062
Room for another?

11:42.077 --> 11:42.862
No.

11:42.953 --> 11:45.069
Oh, but I have currency,

11:45.163 --> 11:47.950
and, uh... other things.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.252
I don't see anything.

11:51.336 --> 11:52.997
Chiana:
No?

11:55.007 --> 11:56.417
Look closer.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.168
Chiana, I think we should
be moving along.

12:01.263 --> 12:02.844
We were just getting to
know each other.

12:02.931 --> 12:04.637
I know exactly what you are.

12:04.725 --> 12:05.760
Oh?

12:05.851 --> 12:07.933
A Nebari tralk.

12:08.020 --> 12:10.932
And a Luxan who took a Sebacean
wife and then murdered her.

12:11.023 --> 12:12.308
( hisses )

12:12.399 --> 12:15.357
D'Argo, we didn't come
here to fight.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.191
No.

12:22.034 --> 12:23.615
No, I wouldn't dream of it.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.534
Lieutenant Reljik.

12:30.626 --> 12:33.288
We were just getting to
know each other.

12:38.175 --> 12:39.915
Ah, Braca.

12:40.010 --> 12:43.173
Crichton's now arrived so
keep your promises.

12:43.263 --> 12:48.348
You owe me a full intelligence
report on the Hynerian
political situation.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.185
Here it is.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.770
Ah.

12:50.854 --> 12:53.220
And you can undergo your
surgery anytime you choose.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.601
That wasn't the only
thing I requested.

12:55.692 --> 12:58.069
We're working on the
other thing.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.150
Work faster.

13:10.165 --> 13:12.326
For the love of cholack.

13:14.086 --> 13:17.078
I heard you were here,
but I didn't believe it.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.925
Will you have a drink with me?

13:32.688 --> 13:35.054
Thank you.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.434
But I only drink with
Peacekeepers.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.191
( background laughter)

13:44.032 --> 13:47.570
And this collimates the organic
residue analyser which, er...

13:47.661 --> 13:52.246
ls trying to figure out why
your wormhole pilots have
turned into goo.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.290
You know of the tissue
liquification effect.

13:55.377 --> 13:56.537
Yeah.

13:56.628 --> 13:59.836
It happened to Linfer when she
tried to defect to Moya.

13:59.923 --> 14:02.289
And what did Linfer tell you?

14:03.468 --> 14:05.254
Not a lot.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.802
She died.

14:07.889 --> 14:10.631
Tell you what, why don't
you pull up her phase
progression equations.

14:10.726 --> 14:14.935
Let's see how they compare
to the stuff your chip
pulled out of my brain.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.226
Fellas.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.608
Open the bag or call me a cab.
I cannot work blind.

14:37.127 --> 14:38.287
How's the pain?

14:38.378 --> 14:41.290
I can increase the
anesthetic mist.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.167
Crichton:
You doing all right, big guy?

14:43.258 --> 14:45.123
Well enough.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.176
Though it is taking slightly
longer than I expected.

14:48.263 --> 14:49.878
My apologies.

14:49.973 --> 14:53.056
These rings weren't designed
to be removed.

14:53.769 --> 14:55.305
(sighs)

14:56.354 --> 14:59.346
The bone will knit shortly,
however.

14:59.441 --> 15:02.399
And the blood is running clear.

15:02.486 --> 15:04.943
You're safe from infection
in here.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.030
Relax there for a few arns.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.449
The griletto mist will
help you heal.

15:14.623 --> 15:16.329
Apparently it's safe
to talk in here.

15:16.416 --> 15:20.204
Crais says that the mist
interferes with their
surveillance equipment.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.661
Well, he should know.
It was his boat.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.415
How you holding up?

15:26.510 --> 15:29.047
Well, | wish I was elsewhere.

15:29.137 --> 15:29.922
Yeah.

15:30.013 --> 15:32.049
Have you decided on a plan?

15:32.140 --> 15:35.724
Plan A was to wipe all their
data, send 'em back
to square one.

15:35.811 --> 15:37.802
That would work if I could
find the erase button.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.261
Mm-hmm...

15:39.356 --> 15:42.689
Plan B, steer them in the
wrong direction.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.188
Except I don't know which
way that is.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.859
I'm starting to look at plan C.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.858
Which is?

15:48.949 --> 15:51.361
Forget the whole thing and run
like hell before they kill us.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.612
Are you serious about that one?

15:54.955 --> 15:56.411
No.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.489
Just tell the others not
to get comfortable.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.369
Trust me, they won't.

16:04.047 --> 16:06.754
Well, that's it for me.

16:06.842 --> 16:12.337
Now how the frell can Scorpius
allow that Luxan on board?

16:12.430 --> 16:14.682
Can't stand Luxans.

16:15.517 --> 16:16.723
Never could.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.266
Me, neither.

16:19.813 --> 16:22.805
Looking down his
ugly nose at us.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.350
Like to wipe that sneer
off his face.

16:26.444 --> 16:28.605
So would I.

16:28.697 --> 16:32.281
You know what might give
him a good scare?

16:32.367 --> 16:39.705
Have you still got that thing
they built for you for the
Battle of Stalaro?

16:39.791 --> 16:42.203
( chuckles )

16:43.253 --> 16:45.835
ldon't like it.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.083
I don't trust Scorpius.

16:49.426 --> 16:51.917
We gonna die here?

16:52.596 --> 16:53.927
What do you mean?

16:54.014 --> 16:56.881
In this room or in a
Command Carrier?

16:58.560 --> 17:00.175
Luxan.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.552
Peacekeepeh

17:02.647 --> 17:04.057
Get up.

17:04.149 --> 17:06.231
Oh, frell.

17:14.910 --> 17:16.571
( groans )

17:26.338 --> 17:28.670
(grunts)

17:33.386 --> 17:34.501
(yells)

17:45.899 --> 17:46.649
D'Argo!

17:46.733 --> 17:47.973
No!

17:49.236 --> 17:50.271
( screams )

17:50.362 --> 17:51.647
( loud thud )

17:52.781 --> 17:54.897
(metallic whirring)

17:57.535 --> 17:59.116
Reljik:
Don't move.

18:05.335 --> 18:07.826
Oh, dear.

18:11.007 --> 18:15.091
Scorpius:
Reljik, if anyone, and I mean
anyone touches our guests,

18:15.178 --> 18:16.714
there'll be two executions.

18:16.805 --> 18:19.763
The offender's, and yours.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.385
Dismissed.

18:28.817 --> 18:32.230
Can anybody think of a reason
why we shouldn't head straight
back for Moya?

18:32.320 --> 18:34.356
No.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.312
We were assured safe passage.

18:36.408 --> 18:39.650
But, John, Ka D'Argo, I do
apologize. But this will
not happen again.

18:39.744 --> 18:41.154
That's right.

18:41.246 --> 18:44.488
Because I'm taking Jool, Chiana
and Rygel back to Moya.

18:44.582 --> 18:45.571
Unnecessary.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.328
The fewer of us on board,

18:47.419 --> 18:50.001
the less likely one of your
people is to get hurt.

18:50.088 --> 18:52.170
Yes, and the less incentive for
you to keep your promises.

18:52.257 --> 18:54.168
But those who wish to
return may, but...

18:54.259 --> 18:56.045
Speaking of promises.

18:56.136 --> 18:59.799
Braca, give him the
file on Macton.

19:03.018 --> 19:05.634
Latest activities,
current location.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.687
Thank you.

19:16.031 --> 19:17.862
(door opening)

19:25.373 --> 19:26.453
Lieutenant.

19:26.541 --> 19:27.451
Captain.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.248
No longer.

19:30.253 --> 19:32.039
What were you told?

19:32.130 --> 19:34.246
Only to assist you as required.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.424
And are you displeased
with this assignment?

19:38.303 --> 19:40.544
Why would I be?

19:40.638 --> 19:43.300
Working with someone who has...

19:43.391 --> 19:44.722
lost his command.

19:44.809 --> 19:47.346
Scorpius stole your command.

19:47.437 --> 19:50.019
I knew he squeezed you
out of power.

19:51.107 --> 19:53.189
What else do you know?

19:53.276 --> 19:55.892
That even though you left
without a word,

19:55.987 --> 19:58.945
I never changed my
feelings for you.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.584
Scorpius.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.292
He knows about our past.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.214
He put me in the Aurora Chair.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.292
Found out everything.

20:20.387 --> 20:23.345
He said if I didn't spy on you,
he'd destroy me.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.672
Why are you telling me this?

20:27.018 --> 20:31.512
For the last two cycles,
I hated you.

20:31.606 --> 20:34.348
It was the only way
I could get through it.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.148
It's as I expected.

20:36.236 --> 20:40.229
Everyone who knew me would
be coerced into spying.

20:40.323 --> 20:41.824
I don't hate you.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.773
I don't hate you, either.

20:49.958 --> 20:52.244
These are design specs, right?

20:52.335 --> 20:54.246
It's our latest approach,

20:54.337 --> 20:59.422
to create an external field
that stabilizes a wormhole
before entry.

20:59.509 --> 21:03.593
You're using this entire ship's
hull as a wave repeater.

21:03.680 --> 21:04.886
Yes.

21:04.973 --> 21:08.136
The ship's mass itself
acts as a multiplier.

21:08.226 --> 21:12.936
If we knew the sub-harmonic
formulas, we could find the
right resonance pattern.

21:15.567 --> 21:17.558
No progress?

21:17.652 --> 21:20.815
Uh, not as yet, sir. So far we
haven't been able to...

21:20.905 --> 21:24.147
to postulate any further
equaﬂons,no.

21:24.242 --> 21:26.153
Why not?

21:26.244 --> 21:29.111
Because we keep being
interrupted.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.821
I'm sorry, John, but we
must move faster.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.123
The equations we need
are in here.

21:34.210 --> 21:35.165
Don't touch me.

21:35.253 --> 21:37.414
Locked away.
I can't get at 'em.

21:37.505 --> 21:40.338
Well, perhaps you're
holding back.

21:40.425 --> 21:41.881
Crichton:
Grasshopper, you
have tried to...

21:41.968 --> 21:44.129
snatch the pebbles
from my head!
-Let me... Let me finish!

21:44.220 --> 21:48.805
You may well be making every
conscious effort but
subconsciously...

21:48.892 --> 21:53.852
you may still believe that I
will misuse the wormhole
technology.

21:53.938 --> 21:57.396
You say you're only after
Scarrans. I'm cool with that.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.815
As long as it's true.

21:58.902 --> 22:00.267
It is.

22:01.404 --> 22:03.315
Maybe I can prove it to you.

22:03.406 --> 22:05.317
What's that?

22:05.408 --> 22:09.947
Excerpts from my file,
documenting my life before I
joined the Peacekeepers.

22:10.038 --> 22:12.745
Uh-huh. What's that
gonna tell me?

22:12.832 --> 22:17.166
Why I despise Scarrans.

22:17.253 --> 22:21.166
Scorpius' datachip made for
interesting viewing, don't
you think, John?

22:21.257 --> 22:25.250
The Scarrans. Are they really
the threat he claims,

22:25.345 --> 22:27.711
or is he just out for revenge?

22:27.805 --> 22:29.261
What do you think?

22:30.058 --> 22:31.514
Phew!

22:31.601 --> 22:37.562
| share his intellect, but not
his passions nor his fears.

22:37.649 --> 22:41.312
Hence my assessment would be
more objective than his.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.529
And I concur with him.

22:43.613 --> 22:46.946
The Scarrans pose a threat
to all other species.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.273
( explosion )

22:50.787 --> 22:52.243
Cheer up, John.

22:52.330 --> 22:55.493
Scorpius has shown his
biography to very few.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.619
He must be trusting you now.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.376
Yeah, that's interesting,

23:00.463 --> 23:03.671
considering I've been lying
to his face.

23:03.758 --> 23:10.345
Well, I've managed to, ah,
normalize your energy signature.

23:10.431 --> 23:13.013
Scorpius can't detect
your lying.

23:13.101 --> 23:14.932
We may yet survive this, John.

23:15.019 --> 23:16.429
Hoo-ha!

23:19.232 --> 23:22.224
Oh, it's magnificent.

23:22.318 --> 23:25.606
Braca, stand down.
He's harmless.

23:25.697 --> 23:27.858
His weapons have
been deactivated.

23:27.949 --> 23:29.689
Am I to take your word for it?

23:29.784 --> 23:32.275
Take my word, Lieutenant.

23:32.370 --> 23:35.578
That ship's biologics are on
minimal auto-support.

23:35.665 --> 23:37.326
All its other systems are dead.

23:37.417 --> 23:40.250
Care to board Talyn and
see for yourself?

23:45.425 --> 23:47.256
And he believed your confession?

23:47.343 --> 23:49.174
Yes.

23:49.262 --> 23:51.503
He trusts me completely.

23:58.354 --> 24:02.597
Announcer:
Group leader Desmon, trials
will commence in ten microts.

24:03.401 --> 24:04.436
This is nice.

24:04.527 --> 24:06.267
It's planetary terrain
reconstruction.

24:06.362 --> 24:09.604
Combat training. There's about
forty on the ship.

24:09.699 --> 24:17.037
Look, Scorpy thinks that
Scarrans are public
enemy number one.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.830
They want to wipe out all the
lesser species. Is that true?

24:19.917 --> 24:21.453
It's what we were taught.

24:21.544 --> 24:26.959
Great. And what if the
Peacekeepers never develop
wormhole tech?

24:27.050 --> 24:30.042
What if that's the only way to
keep the Scarrans at bay?

24:30.136 --> 24:33.173
Well, they'll have to find
another way to repel the
Scarrans, but that's not your problem.

24:33.264 --> 24:35.425
You should be focusing on
what you came here to do.

24:35.516 --> 24:36.471
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

24:36.559 --> 24:38.174
It's just...

24:38.269 --> 24:41.511
it's just going so damn slow.

24:41.606 --> 24:43.642
The stuff in my head.

24:46.319 --> 24:49.482
You know what?
I could be here for a while.

24:51.074 --> 24:53.611
Maybe it's best if
you don't stay.

24:57.914 --> 25:02.032
Reporter:
And calls for Dominar Bishan's
abdication have spread

25:02.126 --> 25:04.617
to four of the primary
homeworlds.

25:04.712 --> 25:07.579
By the Hynerian gods.
Orrhn wasn't lying.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.255
Bishan's in disfavor.

25:09.342 --> 25:11.128
( laughing )

25:11.219 --> 25:13.710
lfl returned, I could
muster up an army,

25:13.805 --> 25:17.013
incite an uprising and
restore myself to power.

25:19.102 --> 25:20.308
I can see it now.

25:20.395 --> 25:22.852
The searing rapture of
my supporters.

25:22.939 --> 25:25.271
"Rygel. Rygel."

25:25.358 --> 25:26.939
Rygel.
-Pilot, what's wrong?

25:27.026 --> 25:28.106
With what?

25:28.194 --> 25:31.152
All systems report
normal function.

25:31.239 --> 25:33.321
No, no, no.

25:37.662 --> 25:39.243
You were screaming.

25:39.330 --> 25:41.616
I... I had a vision.
You were screaming.

25:41.708 --> 25:44.324
But there's nothing wrong.

25:44.419 --> 25:45.499
( beeping )

25:45.586 --> 25:47.292
Ships approaching.

25:47.380 --> 25:49.245
Peacekeeper ships.

25:51.342 --> 25:53.719
A Marauder and two Prowlers
approaching fast.

25:53.803 --> 25:55.418
Another Retrieval Squad?

25:55.513 --> 25:57.219
Frelling Scorpius.

25:57.306 --> 25:58.295
Starburst now, Pilot.

25:58.391 --> 26:02.304
Yes, prepare for
immediate Starburst.

26:15.408 --> 26:17.194
( screaming )

26:26.294 --> 26:29.377
This ship is amazing.

26:29.464 --> 26:32.171
I understand why you
took control of him.

26:33.551 --> 26:35.758
The neural interface.

26:35.845 --> 26:37.801
What was it like?

26:37.889 --> 26:39.925
A thousand different
sensations all at once.

26:40.016 --> 26:41.847
Yet you're willing
to give him up?

26:41.934 --> 26:45.301
No choice. Ultimately, Talyn
would not be commanded.

26:45.396 --> 26:48.229
Ultimately, neither would you.

26:48.316 --> 26:53.276
My inability to take orders is
why I am no longer a captain.

26:53.362 --> 26:55.774
Do you regret leaving
the Peacekeepers?

26:56.199 --> 26:59.066
Sometimes.

26:59.160 --> 27:04.280
What I regret most of is that I
didn't try to take you with me.

27:04.373 --> 27:06.580
I wouldn't have gone.

27:07.710 --> 27:09.371
Not then.

27:15.635 --> 27:18.126
What do you want?

27:18.221 --> 27:20.337
Aeryn:
I want to talk to you.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.422
Do you have something to say?

27:23.935 --> 27:25.721
Where should I start?

27:26.437 --> 27:28.223
What happened?

27:29.106 --> 27:32.189
Am I a traitor?

27:32.276 --> 27:34.483
Well, that depends on
your definition.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.686
Define it how you like,
you're the one who left.

27:36.781 --> 27:38.521
Well, no, I didn't have
a choice in that.

27:38.616 --> 27:42.234
Crais decided I was
irreversibly contaminated
and he threw me out.

27:42.328 --> 27:46.367
And then he turned renegade
and he got thrown out.

27:46.457 --> 27:48.322
You could have come back.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.203
It was too late then.

27:51.212 --> 27:53.749
You think you didn't
have a choice?

27:57.385 --> 27:59.626
I didn't want to come back.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.263
Then you are a traitor.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.887
A deserter, perhaps.

28:06.978 --> 28:09.185
Can you tell me why?

28:11.274 --> 28:13.640
If you really want to know.

28:13.734 --> 28:17.101
Announcer:
Alert. All cannon crew
and Prowler pilots report to stations.

28:17.196 --> 28:20.734
A captured Leviathan is being
escorted to docking area.

28:26.789 --> 28:29.326
Linfer suggested this formula.

28:29.417 --> 28:31.203
I disagreed.

28:31.294 --> 28:34.161
You two argue a lot?

28:34.255 --> 28:39.420
She was a great mind
and a tragic loss.

28:39.510 --> 28:42.593
Yeah, I didn't really get a
chance to know her.

28:43.389 --> 28:44.799
But I liked her.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.676
That's good.

28:53.357 --> 28:55.188
This is wrong.

28:55.276 --> 28:57.767
What, do you see a flaw
in her extrapolation?

28:57.862 --> 28:59.443
Justa hunch.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.812
Excuse me.

29:01.908 --> 29:07.323
That's not right, but there
is another way to go.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.333
Crichton.

29:11.417 --> 29:12.782
They've captured Moya.

29:12.877 --> 29:14.208
Scorpius.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.372
What is this?!

29:19.467 --> 29:22.834
Scorpius gave orders
that this...
-I gave orders.

29:27.892 --> 29:30.224
Lieutenant Reljik, isn't it?

29:30.311 --> 29:31.721
I'm honored you remember, ma'am.

29:31.812 --> 29:35.805
Thrice decorated by High
Command, if I recall correctly.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.356
You do, ma'am.

29:37.443 --> 29:40.810
Would you be so good as to watch
over these prisoners for me?

29:40.905 --> 29:42.645
Ma'am.

29:42.740 --> 29:44.230
Luxan.

29:45.952 --> 29:46.941
Move.

29:47.036 --> 29:49.118
A security Iockdown
is in effect.

29:49.205 --> 29:52.038
Priority Velca Nine.
No one is permitted...

29:54.543 --> 29:57.285
Scorpius:
What have you done?

29:57.380 --> 30:01.248
This Gammak project is
under my authority.

30:01.342 --> 30:06.382
Your authority is not
absolute, Scorpius.

30:06.472 --> 30:11.136
Let me introduce Kor Tosko,
special Luxan ambassador.

30:11.227 --> 30:15.971
The Luxans have signed a defense
agreement with the Peacekeepers.

30:16.065 --> 30:18.727
I have been sent to promote
other such alliances.

30:18.818 --> 30:21.480
But half the planets I visit
fear Peacekeepers.

30:21.570 --> 30:23.982
The other half laugh at us

30:24.073 --> 30:27.986
for our simple inability to
capture a handful of
escaped prisoners

30:28.077 --> 30:30.113
whose exploits are
becoming legendary.

30:30.204 --> 30:32.616
Why should we care what
insignificant systems think?!

30:32.707 --> 30:37.576
We're uniting as much of the
Uncharted Territories
as possible,

30:37.670 --> 30:42.289
to improve our bargaining
position with the Scarrans.

30:42.383 --> 30:44.248
The Council intends
to negotiate?

30:44.343 --> 30:46.584
A truce is being explored.

30:46.679 --> 30:49.136
A truce won't prevent
an invasion.

30:49.223 --> 30:52.340
As a show of weakness,
it may even hasten one.

30:52.435 --> 30:55.051
Hence the alliances,
to show strength.

30:55.146 --> 30:57.478
Showing strength is useless!

30:57.565 --> 31:00.022
My project will
give us strength!

31:01.819 --> 31:03.559
Crichton, stop!

31:04.530 --> 31:06.441
Where is Scorpius?

31:07.199 --> 31:08.314
He didn't capture Moya.

31:08.409 --> 31:11.151
Like hell he didn't.
Moya turned herself in?

31:11.245 --> 31:13.156
It wasn't Scorpius.

31:13.247 --> 31:14.612
Let him explain.
Let me take you to him.

31:14.707 --> 31:16.789
What a good idea.

31:16.876 --> 31:22.121
Even if these chimerical
wormholes of yours had
some military value,

31:22.214 --> 31:25.297
now is not the time to
provoke the Scarrans.

31:25.384 --> 31:30.128
The very existence of this
project imperils a truce.

31:30.222 --> 31:35.592
The very idea of a truce
imperils every Sebacean.

31:35.686 --> 31:38.098
I know Scarrans.

31:38.189 --> 31:41.147
I understand them more
than you ever will.

31:42.443 --> 31:44.058
Appeasement?

31:44.904 --> 31:45.939
Suicide.

31:46.030 --> 31:48.316
Crichton:
In you go!

31:48.407 --> 31:49.908
Hey, Hopper!

31:49.992 --> 31:54.031
Let 'em go or I will kill you,
bracelet or no bracelet.

31:54.121 --> 31:56.077
Calm down, John, calm down.

31:56.165 --> 31:58.372
Moya and your friends
are unharmed.

31:58.459 --> 31:59.539
Well, we'd like to see them.

31:59.627 --> 32:01.037
You can't.

32:01.128 --> 32:03.244
I've taken them into custody.

32:03.339 --> 32:05.045
Have we met?

32:05.132 --> 32:08.249
Commandant Mele-on Grayza.

32:08.344 --> 32:11.051
And you must be the infamous
John Crichton.

32:11.138 --> 32:12.969
Infamous?

32:13.057 --> 32:14.797
Two points, Commandant.

32:14.892 --> 32:19.181
One, your boy here has made a
lot of promises which you
should keep because

32:19.271 --> 32:22.183
two, when my friends
are threatened,

32:22.274 --> 32:26.517
I am infamous for making
really stupid moves, yes?

32:26.612 --> 32:28.352
Mm-hmm.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.109
Point two is clearly correct,

32:31.200 --> 32:34.613
but I cannot accept point one.

32:34.703 --> 32:36.910
You've completely lost control.

32:37.414 --> 32:39.405
Not yet.

32:42.753 --> 32:44.584
This is Scorpius.

32:44.672 --> 32:49.132
Moya and her crew are to
be released at once.

32:50.219 --> 32:53.928
Braca, have a security team
report to my quarters.

32:54.014 --> 32:58.474
They will accommodate Commodore
Grayza and her retinue
to their vessel.

32:58.561 --> 33:02.145
A Prowler detail will escort
them out of this sector.

33:02.231 --> 33:03.937
Sir.

33:04.024 --> 33:07.187
Grayza:
All right, Scorpius, we'll
do this the hard way.

33:07.278 --> 33:10.645
I'll return with a full
council sanction.

33:10.739 --> 33:13.196
You shouldn't have made
me into an enemy.

33:15.536 --> 33:18.994
And you shouldn't have pointed
a weapon at me.

33:23.752 --> 33:26.915
Damn, I got to stop pointing
guns at people.

33:27.006 --> 33:28.337
Scorpius.

33:29.383 --> 33:31.715
I need a Comms channel.

33:31.802 --> 33:34.794
You heard Scorpius.
Release the prisoners.

33:34.889 --> 33:37.050
Ma'am, are you sure?

33:37.141 --> 33:41.635
Do as you are ordered,
Lieutenant.

33:50.237 --> 33:52.478
Jool:
Don't touch me.

33:56.660 --> 33:59.652
Crichton, we were attacked.

33:59.747 --> 34:01.783
Immobilizer Pulse.

34:01.874 --> 34:04.160
I know, Pilot.
It-it's all right.

34:04.251 --> 34:08.585
Moya won't accept a
Control Collar.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.708
Rather be dead.

34:10.799 --> 34:13.836
There's not going to be
a Control Collar.

34:13.928 --> 34:15.839
Tell him.
-Crichton is correct.

34:15.930 --> 34:17.795
Your capture was an error.

34:17.890 --> 34:19.676
This situation will
not occur again.

34:19.767 --> 34:23.385
He means it, Pilot. And tell
Moya I'm gonna to
hold him to it.

34:24.188 --> 34:26.179
Thank you, Commander.

34:26.273 --> 34:30.266
John, now you know what
stupidity I have to deal with,

34:30.361 --> 34:33.068
you must not fail.

34:39.495 --> 34:41.406
( beeping )

34:43.290 --> 34:45.906
Reljik here. I'm alone.

34:46.001 --> 34:48.287
Comms encryption is engaged.

34:48.379 --> 34:51.712
Lieutenant, I intend to remove
Scorpius from Command.

34:51.799 --> 34:54.666
I'm sure most of us here would
fully approve of that action.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.842
But going through channels
takes time.

34:56.929 --> 35:03.095
And given the crew's low
opinion of Scorpius, I'm
concerned for his safety.

35:03.185 --> 35:04.925
He is well protected,

35:05.020 --> 35:08.763
but because of the I-Yensch
bracelet, he is vulnerable,
through John Crichton.

35:08.857 --> 35:11.815
Then I am equally concerned
for Crichton's safety.

35:11.902 --> 35:15.394
I will do my best to address
your concerns, ma'am.

35:16.156 --> 35:18.238
Thank you, Lieutenant.

35:27.376 --> 35:29.583
Ah, 3 simple game.

35:29.670 --> 35:33.288
Not very diverting, unless it's
played for currency.

35:33.382 --> 35:36.545
Oh, I don't want to be diverted.
I just want Crichton to finish
his work so we can go.

35:36.635 --> 35:39.547
Oh, we'll go whether he's
finished or not.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.721
But we may as well take some
Peacekeeper winnings with us.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.264
( laughing )

35:44.351 --> 35:45.136
Play.

35:45.227 --> 35:47.218
Then you've rejected our ideals?

35:47.313 --> 35:51.352
No, not all of them. I've
actually kept loyalty,
sacrifice, honor.

35:51.442 --> 35:54.024
Not all Peacekeepers believe
in those ideals, you know.

35:54.111 --> 35:55.317
I still do.

35:55.404 --> 35:57.395
Yes, I'm sure you do.

36:00.534 --> 36:04.447
Aren't you ever worried that
you might be fighting for
the wrong cause?

36:05.164 --> 36:06.825
No. Never.

36:08.709 --> 36:10.495
What about the wrong leaders?

36:10.586 --> 36:12.542
Scorpius:
He was here under the
Peacekeeper-Luxan Pact.

36:12.629 --> 36:15.245
D'Argo:
I cannot believe that the
Luxans made a pact with the Peacekeepers.

36:15.341 --> 36:17.753
They've merely pledged to
fight any Scarran attack.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.128
They remain autonomous.

36:19.219 --> 36:23.178
Yes, but... for how long?

36:23.265 --> 36:28.055
The knowledge the Ancients
put in my head is starting
to do its job.

36:28.145 --> 36:30.761
I can see which path will work
and which one's a dead end.

36:30.856 --> 36:33.313
So you will be able to steer
Scorpius onto the wrong path?

36:33.400 --> 36:37.313
Yeah, I can screw up his
research for years to come.

36:37.404 --> 36:39.190
Why aren't you happy about that?

36:39.281 --> 36:44.366
'Cause I'm not a hundred percent
sure it's the right thing to do.

36:44.453 --> 36:48.241
The other John gave up his life
to stop the Scarrans from
getting this information.

36:48.332 --> 36:51.699
I know, but it's my shift now.

36:53.045 --> 36:55.502
He didn't know what we know.

36:55.589 --> 36:57.329
He didn't get
Scorpy's backstory.

36:57.424 --> 37:00.882
He didn't see Scorpy put his
ass on the line for us.

37:00.969 --> 37:04.757
So what, now you're actually
considering helping Scorpius?

37:04.848 --> 37:07.180
No.

37:07.267 --> 37:10.100
It's just not clear what
my next move is.

37:10.187 --> 37:12.644
Well, then you get clear. I said
I'd back you up and I will,

37:12.731 --> 37:14.892
but you have to make a decision.

37:18.237 --> 37:22.901
Bialar, I know you may
not believe me, but...

37:22.991 --> 37:24.697
you could come back.

37:24.785 --> 37:26.241
To the Peacekeepers?

37:26.328 --> 37:29.991
Scorpius despises me as
much as I despise him.

37:30.082 --> 37:34.246
This wormhole project,
it means everything to him.

37:34.336 --> 37:37.248
As does loyalty.

37:37.339 --> 37:39.955
Give him what he wants
from Crichton.

37:40.050 --> 37:43.542
Show Scorpius you're
not his enemy.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.939
What?

37:58.026 --> 38:00.062
I think we're being followed.

38:01.447 --> 38:03.358
Through here.

38:06.201 --> 38:08.487
Don't touch anything.

38:08.579 --> 38:10.365
What is this place?
-|t's a generator.

38:10.456 --> 38:12.412
It's unlikely we'll be
followed through here.

38:12.499 --> 38:14.581
Yeah, it's a good place
for an ambush.

38:14.668 --> 38:15.953
Got them, sir.

38:16.044 --> 38:18.251
Junction three, Ierg eight.

38:21.091 --> 38:23.628
Well, our odds aren't going
to get any better.

38:29.683 --> 38:31.423
Aw hell, Karate man.

38:37.441 --> 38:39.022
(grunts)

38:41.153 --> 38:44.611
( groans )

38:44.698 --> 38:45.858
Braca!

38:45.949 --> 38:49.157
Crichton is being assaulted.
Find him.

38:51.288 --> 38:53.074
Crichton, get clear!

38:53.165 --> 38:54.371
What?

38:58.212 --> 39:00.077
(grunts)

39:05.928 --> 39:07.884
VVespo:
No pulse weapons. Not in here.

39:19.107 --> 39:20.313
Reljik:
Oh, yes.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.356
(chuckling)

39:24.863 --> 39:26.239
John Crichton.

39:47.261 --> 39:48.671
He's here!

39:49.596 --> 39:51.803
( screaming )

39:58.355 --> 39:59.561
Sir.

40:00.566 --> 40:01.897
I'm all right.

40:01.984 --> 40:03.064
Crichton?

40:03.151 --> 40:04.891
We're checking every
level, sir.

40:23.255 --> 40:24.586
Frell.

40:54.244 --> 40:56.075
( groans )

40:56.163 --> 40:57.243
( laughing )

40:57.331 --> 40:58.821
Oh God!

41:19.561 --> 41:20.846
(yelling)

41:25.484 --> 41:27.440
( choking )

41:30.697 --> 41:32.528
( choking )

41:36.119 --> 41:38.235
( screaming )

41:43.293 --> 41:44.999
(charging up)

41:50.717 --> 41:52.423
Ah! Woah!

41:58.266 --> 42:01.224
( charging )

42:03.188 --> 42:05.804
This is just not fair.

42:07.609 --> 42:08.849
Crichton, where are you?

42:08.944 --> 42:11.276
Up top! About to blow up!

42:12.447 --> 42:14.153
Aeryn!

42:28.213 --> 42:31.455
Just in case there's any more
assassination attempts.

42:31.550 --> 42:33.791
Hey, how'd it feel at your end?

42:33.885 --> 42:36.137
Our time is running out.

42:36.221 --> 42:40.214
Commandant Grayza will
return very soon.

42:40.308 --> 42:42.173
Work it out, Scorp.

42:42.269 --> 42:44.976
Get your ship under control
here. They were after me
to get at you.

42:45.063 --> 42:48.180
Realize that the situation
has now changed.

42:48.275 --> 42:51.312
Our fates are now well
and truly linked.

42:51.403 --> 42:56.238
We have been over this.
I am still trying to assimilate
all the data your people collected.

42:56.324 --> 42:59.691
Grayza's arrival drastically
changes our timetable.

42:59.786 --> 43:02.163
It is Einstein's timetable.

43:02.247 --> 43:05.205
God, it's God's timetable,
Scorp.

43:05.292 --> 43:07.203
Fix your end.
I'm doing my bit.

43:07.294 --> 43:08.784
Are you?

43:08.879 --> 43:12.121
Why are you bitching at me like
we're married, Scorpy-Sue?

43:12.215 --> 43:14.297
Just tell me what's
on your mind.

43:14.384 --> 43:16.921
I suspect you're stalling.

43:17.012 --> 43:19.799
Either through ignorance
or by design.

43:19.890 --> 43:21.755
I hoped you'd see reason.

43:21.850 --> 43:25.513
What do you think I see, huh?

43:29.357 --> 43:34.226
Dick Tracy's freaking
neuro-bracelet linking me to
Bram Stoker's nightmare.

43:34.321 --> 43:37.939
What more do you want from me?

43:47.375 --> 43:49.206
Cooperation.

43:55.550 --> 43:58.257
You stole that from my memory.

43:58.345 --> 44:00.631
You will kill both of us.

44:01.681 --> 44:03.467
I reckon so.

44:07.312 --> 44:08.677
(yells)

44:10.732 --> 44:12.393
( growls )

44:14.486 --> 44:19.105
It took quite some effort to
triangulate the stars
from your planet.

44:19.199 --> 44:22.362
More to gain a visual
confirmation.

44:22.452 --> 44:25.159
Get the hell off of me,
you freak!

44:27.082 --> 44:30.119
Even without wormholes,
Earth is reachable.

44:30.210 --> 44:34.294
At top speed, just
over 60 cycles.

44:38.134 --> 44:41.297
You give me what I want
or I swear,

44:41.388 --> 44:47.384
I will keep you alive so that
you can witness your home
world's destruction!
