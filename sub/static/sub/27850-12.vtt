WHERE IT'S LIKE, OKAY, WE HAVE

03:39.103 --> 03:42.236
TO DO SOME SHIT HERE TO MAKE

IN THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS OR WE'RE

04:00.303 --> 04:01.470
GOING TO QUIT.

04:01.470 --> 04:02.870
>> AND HE REACHED IT.

04:05.503 --> 04:08.370
>> KERRY WAS AT 4% FOUR MONTHS

04:08.370 --> 04:08.637
OUT.

04:08.637 --> 04:09.804

04:09.804 --> 04:11.570
WHAT WE KNOW IS WHAT WE THINK

04:11.570 --> 04:12.970
WILL HAPPEN IN IOWA IN OCTOBER

04:12.970 --> 04:14.570
IS NEVER WHAT HAPPENS IN

04:14.570 --> 04:14.837
FEBRUARY.

04:14.837 --> 04:15.470
>> YEAH.

04:15.470 --> 04:16.804
>> IT IS TRUE.

04:16.804 --> 04:19.136
BUT THERE IS A REALITY HERE THAT

04:19.136 --> 04:21.870
NO OTHER DEMOCRATIC FIELD HAS

04:21.870 --> 04:24.203
FACED THIS SORT OF SUN BLOTTING

04:24.203 --> 04:25.270
SCANDAL THAT IS UNFOLDING IN

04:25.270 --> 04:26.270
WASHINGTON RIGHT NOW.

04:28.570 --> 04:29.103
>> IMPEACHMENT IS.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.470
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT JOE BIDEN

04:30.470 --> 04:32.270
RIGHT NOW, HE'S BEEN DRAGGED

04:32.270 --> 04:34.136
INTO THE IMPEACHMENT STORY.

04:34.136 --> 04:36.470
THE QUESTION OF DO YOU SAY

04:36.470 --> 04:37.904
DONALD TRUMP WAS AFRAID OF ME,

04:37.904 --> 04:39.270
THAT'S WHY HE WAS TRYING TO DIG

04:39.270 --> 04:41.270
UP DIRT WITH ME WITH THE

04:41.270 --> 04:41.704
UKRAINIANS.

04:41.704 --> 04:43.437
WEAR THAT THING LIKE A BADGE OF

04:43.437 --> 04:44.036
HONOR.

04:44.036 --> 04:45.370
THE RISK SIDE OF THAT IS YOU

04:45.370 --> 04:47.003
HAVE TO START OUT TALKING ABOUT

04:47.003 --> 04:48.036
HUNTER BIDEN.

04:48.036 --> 04:49.103
>> YEAH.

04:49.103 --> 04:50.070
ANY CAMPAIGN OR ANY CANDIDATE

04:50.070 --> 04:52.003
THAT I WORKED FOR, WHEN IT COMES

04:52.003 --> 04:54.303
TO FAMILY, THEY RESPOND

04:54.303 --> 04:54.603
EMOTIONALLY.

04:54.603 --> 04:54.804
RIGHT?

04:54.804 --> 04:56.036
>> THAT'S THE THING ABOUT TRUMP

04:56.036 --> 04:57.804
FSHLG IT'S NOT JUST THAT HE'S

04:57.804 --> 04:59.704
GOING AFTER HUNTER BIDEN BECAUSE

04:59.704 --> 05:01.837
HE'S LOW HANGING FRUIT, AS A

05:01.837 --> 05:02.970
POLITICAL ANIMAL TRUMP KNOWS

05:02.970 --> 05:04.136
WHERE THE SOFT TISSUE ON

05:04.136 --> 05:05.170
EVERYBODY HE FIGHTS WITH.

05:05.170 --> 05:06.070
IT'S BRUTAL.

05:06.070 --> 05:08.270
>> IN THIS MOMENT OF CRISIS

05:08.270 --> 05:10.003
WHERE HIS PRESIDENCY IS IN

05:10.003 --> 05:10.870
PERIL, DONALD TRUMP IS PUNCHING

05:10.870 --> 05:12.804
PEOPLE IN THE NOSE OVER AND OVER

05:12.804 --> 05:14.303
AND OVER AGAIN.

05:14.303 --> 05:15.403
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

05:15.403 --> 05:17.370
>> EVERY DAY I THINK WHAT IS IT

05:17.370 --> 05:18.603
LIKE TO SIT IN THAT WHITE HOUSE

05:18.603 --> 05:19.737
RIGHT NOW?

05:19.737 --> 05:21.904
>> WITH CLINTON AND IMPEACHMENT,

05:21.904 --> 05:24.070
THAT WAS A PRETTY VOLATILE

05:24.070 --> 05:24.303
PLACE.

05:24.303 --> 05:29.236
BUT THE THING IS HOWEVER CHAOTIC

05:29.236 --> 05:30.670
WHITE HOUSE'S LOOK FROM THE

05:30.670 --> 05:31.503
OUTSIDE, IT'S ALWAYS WAY WORSE

05:31.503 --> 05:33.937
ON THE INSIDE.

05:33.937 --> 05:36.637
>> IT IS QUITE A MOMENT, RIGHT?

05:36.637 --> 05:38.003
THERE'S KIND OF A DESPERATION IN

05:38.003 --> 05:39.870
THE AIR RIGHT NOW.

05:39.870 --> 05:44.170
>> LIKE, WHAT DO DESPERATE TIMES

08:27.637 --> 08:28.837
BOYFRIEND, BUT THIS GUY IS

08:28.837 --> 08:29.070
AWESOME.

08:29.070 --> 08:31.437
>> EVEN HIS COMPETITORS SAY CORY

08:31.437 --> 08:32.537
IS BUILDING A REAL GROUND

08:32.537 --> 08:35.337
OPERATION THAT COULD BE A TOP

08:35.337 --> 08:35.837
THREE GROUND OPERATION.

08:35.837 --> 08:38.003
>> IT'S BROKEN PHONE.

08:38.003 --> 08:39.537
>> WE'RE ALL A LITTLE CRACKED.

08:39.537 --> 08:42.203
>> THERE'S A LOT OF LOVE FOR

08:42.203 --> 08:42.770
CORY BOOKER.

08:42.770 --> 08:44.403
HE'S A LOT OF PEOPLES SECOND

08:44.403 --> 08:44.637
CHOICE.

08:44.637 --> 08:46.003
THAT COULD BE A FRUSTRATING

08:46.003 --> 08:47.437
POSITION FOR HIM OR HE'S

08:47.437 --> 08:49.236
POSITIONED TO BREAK OUT IN

08:49.236 --> 08:50.937
OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER.

08:50.937 --> 08:53.904
>> THE DES MOINES REGISTER IS

08:53.904 --> 08:54.970
THE HEARTBEAT OF IOWA.

08:54.970 --> 08:57.437
RIGHT NOW CORY IS DOING THE DES

08:57.437 --> 08:58.570
MOINES REGISTER ED BOARD.

08:58.570 --> 09:00.637
>> COULD BE A BIG DEAL.

09:00.637 --> 09:02.203
THE REGISTER'S ENDORSEMENT IS A

09:02.203 --> 09:04.403
RARE ENDORSEMENT THAT MATTERS IN

09:04.403 --> 09:06.236
A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.

09:06.236 --> 09:07.603
>> THIS CAMPAIGN, IT'S NOT ABOUT

09:07.603 --> 09:09.670
WHAT WE'RE AGAINST.

09:09.670 --> 09:10.870
IT'S NOT ABOUT DRONALD TRUMP.

09:10.870 --> 09:12.370
IT'S ABOUT US, WHO WE ARE AND

09:12.370 --> 09:14.036
WHO WE ARE TO EACH OTHER.

09:14.036 --> 09:14.937
BEATING DONALD TRUMP IS

09:14.937 --> 09:15.203
IMPORTANT.

09:15.203 --> 09:16.670
BUT IT'S THE FLOOR, IT'S NOT THE

09:16.670 --> 09:16.904
CEILING.

09:16.904 --> 09:17.837
I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT

09:17.837 --> 09:20.070
BECAUSE I BELIEVE BEATING HIM IS

09:20.070 --> 09:21.904
CRITICAL, IT GETS US OUT OF A

09:21.904 --> 09:22.170
VALLEY.

09:22.170 --> 09:23.704
I'M RUNNING BECAUSE I THINK OUR

09:23.704 --> 09:24.770
COUNTRY HAS TO ASPIRE TO GET TO

09:24.770 --> 09:31.870
THE MOUNTAINTOP.

09:32.270 --> 09:33.270
>> SO, IMPEACHMENT.

09:33.270 --> 09:33.837
>> YES.

09:33.837 --> 09:35.837
>> YOU HAD MOMENTS WHERE IT'S

09:35.837 --> 09:36.837
LIKE CORY BOOKER IS GETTING

09:36.837 --> 09:37.970
READY TO TAKE OFF, THEN

09:37.970 --> 09:40.003
SOMETHING COMES IN THAT PREVENTS

09:40.003 --> 09:41.670
YOU FROM BEING ABLE TO, LIKE,

09:41.670 --> 09:43.036
TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE

09:43.036 --> 09:43.403
MOMENT.

09:43.403 --> 09:44.637
HOW MUCH DO YOU FEEL LIKE

09:44.637 --> 09:45.837
IMPEACHMENT IS BEING PAID

09:45.837 --> 09:47.136
ATTENTION TO BY VOTERS?

09:47.136 --> 09:48.236
IS IT HARD TO BREAK THROUGH

09:48.236 --> 09:48.437
THAT?

09:48.437 --> 09:50.170
>> WE HAD OUR FIRST QUESTION ON

09:50.170 --> 09:51.804
THIS CAMPAIGN SINCE THAT I HAVE

09:51.804 --> 09:53.403
GOTTEN IN A PUBLIC FORUM LAST

09:53.403 --> 09:53.603
NIGHT.

09:53.603 --> 09:55.170
SOMEBODY ASKING A QUESTION ABOUT

09:55.170 --> 09:55.470
IMPEACHMENT.

09:55.470 --> 09:56.236
IT'S NOT THE ISSUE.

09:56.236 --> 09:58.170
YOU HAVE TO BE OUT HERE DOING

09:58.170 --> 10:00.070
EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN TO GET

10:00.070 --> 10:04.070
YOUR MESSAGE ACROSS TO LET

10:04.070 --> 10:05.236
PEOPLE HEAR YOUR HEART AND

10:05.236 --> 10:05.470
SPIRIT.

10:05.470 --> 10:06.804
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A ZEN ATTITUDE

10:06.804 --> 10:09.070
AND LET THE REST FALL WHERE IT

10:09.070 --> 10:09.203
CAN.

10:09.203 --> 10:14.170
>> NOW A STORY COMES OUT THAT

10:14.170 --> 10:16.770
THE WHISTLE-BLOWER HAS A

10:16.770 --> 10:17.270
CONNECTION TO THE 2020

10:17.270 --> 10:19.203
CANDIDATE.

10:19.203 --> 10:19.837
DO YOU HAVE A CONNECTION TO THE

10:19.837 --> 10:20.203
WHISTLE-BLOWER?

10:20.203 --> 10:20.737
>> I DON'T KNOW WHO THE

10:20.737 --> 10:21.170
WHISTLE-BLOWER IS.

10:21.170 --> 10:23.570
>> IT'S AN ELEMENT THAT TRUMP

10:23.570 --> 10:23.937
WILL SEIZE ON.

10:23.937 --> 10:25.503
YOU ARE STILL AT 2%.

10:25.503 --> 10:28.203
TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO PAY

10:28.203 --> 10:29.670
ATTENTION TO CORY BOOKER, IS

10:29.670 --> 10:30.670
THAT NOT HARD?

10:30.670 --> 10:33.103
>> FIRST OF ALL YOU'RE

10:33.103 --> 10:35.203
SLANDERING ME BY SAYING 2%.

10:35.203 --> 10:37.036
TO QUALIFY FOR THE STAGE, 3%.

10:37.036 --> 10:38.170
>> I'M SORRY, MAN.

10:38.170 --> 10:39.637
>> REALLY, STEP OUTSIDE.

10:39.637 --> 10:43.170
I HAVE NO CONTROL OVER ANYTHING

10:43.170 --> 10:43.403
HE SAID.

10:43.403 --> 10:44.870
I HAVE TO GET OUT EVERY DAY AND

10:44.870 --> 10:46.170
DO THE WORK.

10:46.170 --> 10:47.537
THE POLLS HAVE NEVER BEEN

10:47.537 --> 10:48.937
PREDICTIVE THIS FAR OUT.

10:48.937 --> 10:50.537
THE METRICS THAT MATTER IS HOW

10:50.537 --> 10:52.036
GOOD ARE YOUR ORGANIZATION AND

10:52.036 --> 10:54.136
WHO ARE YOU GETTING IN THOSE

10:54.136 --> 10:54.837
CAUCUS ROOMS THAT HAS THE

10:54.837 --> 10:56.670
ABILITY TO HELP GENERATE SUPPORT

10:56.670 --> 10:57.837
FOR YOU?

10:57.837 --> 11:00.537
THE ACTIVISTS, THE LOCAL

11:00.537 --> 11:00.770
ELECTED.

11:00.770 --> 11:06.503
ALL THE METRICS I LOOK AT I FEEL

11:06.503 --> 11:08.570
GOOD EXCEPT FOR FRUNDUND-RAISIN.

11:08.570 --> 11:09.837
>> YOU GUYS DID A THING THAT'S

11:09.837 --> 11:11.537
AN UP-FRONT GIMMICK AS MUCH AS

11:11.537 --> 11:12.403
ANYTHING IN THIS CAMPAIGN.

11:12.403 --> 11:15.837
IT TOOK A DESPERATE MEASUREMENT

11:15.837 --> 11:16.670
>> CORY BOOKER SENT OUT THAT

11:16.670 --> 11:18.170
PLEA BEGGING FOR MONEY BEFORE

11:18.170 --> 11:19.837
THE END OF THIS FUND-RAISING

11:19.837 --> 11:20.103
DEADLINE.

11:20.103 --> 11:22.603
>> $2 MILLION BY NEXT MONDAY IN

11:22.603 --> 11:26.170
ORDER TO REMAIN VIABLE IN THE

11:26.170 --> 11:27.170
2020 RACE.

11:27.170 --> 11:31.303
>> WE WERE IN A DIRE STRAIGHT

11:31.303 --> 11:32.036
NOT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE MONEY

11:32.036 --> 11:33.904
BUT BECAUSE WE WANT TO FIELD A

11:33.904 --> 11:35.470
TEAM THAT CAN WIN.

11:35.470 --> 11:37.904
I CAN STAY IN THIS RACE AND HOPE

11:37.904 --> 11:38.303
LIGHTNING STRIKES.

11:38.303 --> 11:39.637
WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR THAT.

11:39.637 --> 11:41.203
WE HAD A PATHWAY TO VICTORY THAT

11:41.203 --> 11:42.670
WE WERE TRYING TO PRESERVE.

11:42.670 --> 11:44.603
I WAS BEING VERY CANDID WITH

11:44.603 --> 11:44.837
PEOPLE.

11:44.837 --> 11:45.837
LIFTING UP THE HOOD.

11:45.837 --> 11:47.437
CALL IT A STUNT IF YOU WANT, BUT

11:47.437 --> 11:49.537
IT WAS A HECK OF A LOT OF

11:49.537 --> 11:51.036
HONESTY, IF WE CAN'T RAISE THE

11:51.036 --> 11:52.737
MONEY TO KEEP OUR COMPETITIVE

11:52.737 --> 11:55.337
ADVANTAGE IN IOWA, WHY ARE WE

11:55.337 --> 11:57.403
STAYING IN THIS RACE?

11:57.403 --> 11:58.670
I'M GOING TO WIN THE IOWA

11:58.670 --> 11:58.937
CAUCUSES.

11:58.937 --> 12:03.203
I WILL CONVINCE EVERY SINGLE

12:03.203 --> 12:04.804
PERSON WHY I'M GOING TO WIN AND

12:04.804 --> 12:07.470
WHY I'M THE PERSON.

12:07.470 --> 12:07.970
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

12:07.970 --> 12:09.003
WITHDRAWING TROOPS FROM SYRIA

12:09.003 --> 12:10.103
DESPITE OBJECTIONS FROM AMERICAN

12:10.103 --> 12:10.804
ALLIES.

12:10.804 --> 12:11.670
>> THE ANNOUNCEMENT BLIND-SIDED

12:11.670 --> 12:14.136
SENIOR OFFICIALS AT THE

12:14.136 --> 12:15.370
PENTAGON.

12:15.370 --> 12:19.003
>> WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE TULSI

12:19.003 --> 12:22.103
GABBARD PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

12:22.103 --> 12:22.704
AND CONGRESSWOMAN FROM HAWAII.

12:23.870 --> 12:24.270
>> HOW ARE YOU?

12:24.270 --> 12:25.270
>> NICE TO MEET YOU.

12:25.270 --> 12:25.704
>> NICE TO MEET YOU.

12:25.704 --> 12:26.337
>> GABBARD IS A MILITARY VETERAN

12:26.337 --> 12:28.403
WHO SERVED IN IRAQ AND HAS

12:28.403 --> 12:29.970
STRONG FEELINGS ON FOREIGN

12:29.970 --> 12:30.203
POLICY.

12:30.203 --> 12:32.070
SHE THINKS WE'RE INVOLVED IN TOO

12:32.070 --> 12:34.637
MANY FOREIGN WARS.

12:34.637 --> 12:35.236
>> WHAT WILL SET ME APART AS

12:35.236 --> 12:37.904
PRESIDENT IS I AM A VETERAN.

12:37.904 --> 12:41.537
I TAKE TO HEART THE WARRIOR

12:41.537 --> 12:44.804
ETHOS ENGRAINED IN EVERY SINGLE

12:44.804 --> 12:45.103
ONE OF US.

12:45.103 --> 12:48.637
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

12:51.603 --> 12:53.870
>> THE PRESIDENT DECLARED THAT

12:53.870 --> 12:55.603
HE WILL PULL THE TROOPS OUT OF

12:55.603 --> 12:57.203
SYRIA.

12:57.203 --> 12:57.837
WHAT ABOUT JUST THE PROCESS BY

12:57.837 --> 12:58.470
WHICH THE PRESIDENT IS DOING

12:58.470 --> 12:58.770
THIS.

12:58.770 --> 12:59.837
>> THIS IS PART OF THE PROBLEM

12:59.837 --> 13:02.103
IS THAT NO ONE REALLY SEEMS TO

13:02.103 --> 13:04.170
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

13:04.170 --> 13:05.804
NO ONE REALLY SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT

13:05.804 --> 13:06.537
IS THE PLAN?

13:06.537 --> 13:07.470
IS THERE A PLAN?

13:07.470 --> 13:08.270
WHAT'S THE STRATEGY?

13:08.270 --> 13:09.770
WHAT'S THE GOAL AND THE

13:09.770 --> 13:10.036
OBJECTIVE?

13:10.036 --> 13:11.270
>> IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT, WHAT

13:11.270 --> 13:12.970
WOULD YOU BE DOING THERE?

13:12.970 --> 13:15.270
YOU MET WITH PRESIDENT ASSAD.

13:15.270 --> 13:16.704
THAT WAS SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL.

13:16.704 --> 13:18.036
WOULD YOU MEET WITH HIM AGAIN?

13:18.036 --> 13:18.670
>> I WOULD.

13:18.670 --> 13:21.737
IF TAKING SUCH A MEETING WOULD

13:21.737 --> 13:25.170
SAVE EVEN ONE OF OUR SERVICEMEN

13:25.170 --> 13:27.437
OR WOMEN, IT'S WORTH IT.

13:27.437 --> 13:30.103
>> WE'RE IN NEW IMPEACHMENT LAND

13:30.103 --> 13:30.270
NOW.

13:30.270 --> 13:32.337
>> I'VE BEEN VERY PUBLIC IN THE

13:32.337 --> 13:36.303
PAST ABOUT EXPRESSING MY

13:36.303 --> 13:38.570
OPPOSITION TO PURSUING

13:38.570 --> 13:39.904
IMPEACHMENT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE

13:39.904 --> 13:43.637
SEEN AS A PURELY PARTISAN

13:43.637 --> 13:44.670
MOVEMENT SEEKING TO UNDERMINE

13:44.670 --> 13:46.337
THE OUTCOME OF THE 2016

13:46.337 --> 13:46.603
ELECTION.

13:46.603 --> 13:48.003
>> WHICH IS WHAT TRUMP

13:48.003 --> 13:48.737
SUPPORTERS ARE SAYING.

13:48.737 --> 13:52.070
>> WHICH IS THE TRUTH.

13:52.070 --> 13:54.870
I'M SUPPORTING THIS INQUIRY

13:54.870 --> 13:56.570
BECAUSE I THINK THE ISSUES THAT

13:56.570 --> 13:57.937
HAVE BEEN RAISED SPECIFICALLY

13:57.937 --> 14:00.603
AROUND UKRAINE DESERVE FURTHER

14:00.603 --> 14:01.537
INQUIRY AND INVESTIGATION.

14:01.537 --> 14:03.537
>> THE BREAKING NEWS, THE

14:03.537 --> 14:04.470
PRESIDENT'S LAWYER, THE WHITE

14:04.470 --> 14:07.170
HOUSE HAS DECLARED THEY WILL NOT

14:07.170 --> 14:08.003
PARTICIPATE IN IMPEACHMENT

14:08.003 --> 14:09.870
INQUIRY BECAUSE IT'S

14:09.870 --> 14:11.136
ILLEGITIMATE AND VIOLATES

14:11.136 --> 14:13.503
PRECEDENT AND DUE PROCESS.

14:13.503 --> 14:14.704
>> THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.

14:14.704 --> 14:16.236
THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT HOW

14:16.236 --> 14:17.270
HE'S DONE NOTHING WRONG.

14:17.270 --> 14:19.103
HE HAS NOTHING TO HIDE.

14:19.103 --> 14:20.437
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS.

14:20.437 --> 14:21.303
PROVIDE THE INFORMATION.

14:21.303 --> 14:22.503
SHARE WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

14:22.503 --> 14:26.370
WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND WHY YOU'VE

14:26.370 --> 14:29.036
DONE IT.

14:29.270 --> 14:30.937
>> HERE IN ROCHESTER WILL BE THE

14:30.937 --> 14:32.603
FIRST TIME A LOT OF VOTERS HAVE

14:32.603 --> 14:33.770
A CHANCE TO HEAR FROM THE VICE

14:33.770 --> 14:34.737
PRESIDENT ADDRESSING THIS

14:34.737 --> 14:36.337
IMPEACHMENT CONTROVERSY.

14:36.337 --> 14:40.870
>> HIS ADVANTAGE THAT HE'S SEEN

14:40.870 --> 14:41.437
IN THE POLLS FOR MONTHS HAS

14:41.437 --> 14:41.937
REALLY STARTED TO SLIP.

14:41.937 --> 14:44.670
>> HE NEEDS TO BE MUCH MORE

14:44.670 --> 14:45.804
FORCEFUL.

14:45.804 --> 14:47.670
>> IN RECENT WEEKS THE BIDEN

14:47.670 --> 14:51.170
CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN PROMISING THE

14:51.170 --> 14:54.537
PRESS NEWS, THIS IS THE TOWN

14:54.537 --> 14:56.503
HALL TO COME TO, THIS IS THE

14:56.503 --> 14:57.403
STUMP SPEECH TO ATTEND.

14:57.403 --> 14:58.837
>> THE FACT THEY KEEP FEELING

14:58.837 --> 15:00.804
THEY HAVE TO MAKE NEWS TELLS YOU

15:00.804 --> 15:02.337
THEY'RE NOT ACCOMPLISHING WHAT

15:02.337 --> 15:07.203
THEY SET OUT TO DO.

15:07.203 --> 15:11.103
>> TO MARKS THE FIRST TIME THAT

15:11.103 --> 15:11.970
ACCORDING TO POLLING AVERAGES

15:11.970 --> 15:13.103
THAT ELIZABETH WARREN IS AHEAD

15:13.103 --> 15:13.770
OF JOE BIDEN.

15:13.770 --> 15:15.236
THE PROBLEM WITH BIDEN, IF

15:15.236 --> 15:17.337
YOU'RE THE FRONT-RUNNER AND YOUR

15:17.337 --> 15:19.236
STRENGTH IS YOUR INEVITABILITY

15:19.236 --> 15:22.036
AND THAT STARTS TO CRUMBLE, DOES

15:22.036 --> 15:26.537
IT ALL COLLAPSE?

15:30.036 --> 15:31.870
>> TDONALD TRUMP HAS BETRAYED

15:31.870 --> 15:33.503
THIS NATION AND COMMITTED

15:33.503 --> 15:34.537
IMPEACHABLE ACTS.

15:34.537 --> 15:36.637
HE'S INSINUATED THAT PEOPLE WHO

15:36.637 --> 15:38.403
SPOKE TO THE WHISTLE-BLOWER

15:38.403 --> 15:41.937
SHOULD BE EXECUTED.

15:41.937 --> 15:43.437
HE BELIEVES HE CAN AND WILL GET

15:43.437 --> 15:46.403
AWAY WITH ANYTHING HE DOES.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.303
HE HAS NO SENSE OF DECENCY.

15:48.303 --> 15:53.704
HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE LAW.

15:53.704 --> 15:58.003
WE CANNOT LET HIM GET AWAY WITH

15:58.003 --> 16:00.470
IT.

16:03.603 --> 16:04.904
TO SPPRESERVE OUR CONSTITUTION,

16:04.904 --> 16:07.670
OUR DEMOCRACY, OUR BASIC

16:07.670 --> 16:11.603
INTEGRITY, HE SHOULD BE

16:11.603 --> 16:12.136
IMPEACHED.

16:12.136 --> 16:16.203
>> FOLLOWING BREAKING NEWS.

16:16.203 --> 16:16.770

16:23.470 --> 16:24.603
IMPEACHMENT OF DONALD TRUMP.

16:24.603 --> 16:26.170
>> HE TARGETED ME AND MY FAMILY

16:26.170 --> 16:28.603
WITH LIES, DISTORTIONS AND

16:28.603 --> 16:28.837
SMEARS.

16:28.837 --> 16:30.170
I'M NOT GOING TO LET HIM GET

16:30.170 --> 16:32.070
AWAY WITH IT.

16:32.070 --> 16:34.470
HE'S PICKED A FIGHT WITH THE

16:34.470 --> 16:35.403
WRONG GUY.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.503
>> HE'S PICKED A FIGHT WITH THE

16:37.503 --> 16:38.837
WRONG GUY.

16:38.837 --> 16:46.036
>> PUT YOUR DUKES UP.

16:48.804 --> 16:49.837
>> VICE PRESIDENT SHOWED UP TO

16:49.837 --> 16:50.603
PLAY TODAY.

16:50.603 --> 16:52.837
THERE WAS PAPRIKA ON THE

16:52.837 --> 16:53.070
OATMEAL.

16:53.070 --> 16:53.470
>> THAT'S GOOD.

16:53.470 --> 17:00.503
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

17:01.670 --> 17:05.270
>> JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN GOOD TO

17:05.270 --> 17:05.870
THIS STATE, GOOD TO A LOT OF

17:05.870 --> 17:06.337
PEOPLE IN THIS STATE.

17:06.337 --> 17:06.637
>> MM-HMM.

17:06.637 --> 17:10.503
>> THEY LIKE JOE BIDEN.

17:10.503 --> 17:11.937
WE NEED TO WIN.

17:11.937 --> 17:14.003
>> WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS TRUE FOR

17:14.003 --> 17:14.570
NEW HAMPSHIRE.

17:14.570 --> 17:16.170
IT'S LIKE NEW HAMPSHIRITES MAY

17:16.170 --> 17:18.503
BE PUTTING THEIR HEART TO THE

17:18.503 --> 17:20.236
SIDE SAYING NO MATTER WHO I

17:20.236 --> 17:21.470
LOVE, I HAVE TO FIND THE PERSON

17:21.470 --> 17:22.737
WHO HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO

17:22.737 --> 17:23.403
BEAT HIM.

17:23.403 --> 17:24.570
THAT'S A DIFFERENT CALCULATION.

17:24.570 --> 17:26.704
I CAN SEE HOW THAT CAN BREAK

17:26.704 --> 17:27.503
REALLY LATE LIKE JANUARY.

17:27.503 --> 17:28.036
>> YEAH.

17:28.036 --> 17:31.937
BUT I THINK THAT IF THE TOP

17:31.937 --> 17:32.837
THREE COME UP TOP THREE AND

17:32.837 --> 17:34.670
EVERYONE ELSE IS IN THE SINGLE

17:34.670 --> 17:35.904
DIGITS, YOU KNOW, I THINK NEW

17:35.904 --> 17:37.970
HAMPSHIRE WON'T BE DEFINITIVE

17:37.970 --> 17:38.603
FOR ANYBODY.

17:38.603 --> 17:39.036
>> RIGHT.

17:39.036 --> 17:40.670
>> IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE,

17:40.670 --> 17:42.437
NOT IN THE TOP THREE, COMING IN

17:42.437 --> 17:44.503
SECOND OR THIRD, THAT'S THE

17:44.503 --> 17:45.403
COMEBACK KID.

17:45.403 --> 17:46.570
THAT'S THE PERSON THEY'LL WATCH.

17:46.570 --> 17:47.770
THAT'S THE PERSON WHO WILL GET

17:47.770 --> 17:48.637
ALL THE NEWS.

17:48.637 --> 17:50.537
IT COULD BE AMY KLOBUCHAR, IT

17:50.537 --> 17:52.270
COULD BE MICHAEL BENNETT, IT

17:52.270 --> 17:52.804
COULD BE ANYONE.

17:52.804 --> 17:53.870
THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE IS GOING

17:53.870 --> 17:54.036
FOR.

17:54.036 --> 17:56.704
>> YOU THINK THAT IS THE CASE,

17:56.704 --> 17:56.870
JEN?

17:56.870 --> 17:58.937
THAT THE CEMENT IS STILL WET?

17:58.937 --> 17:59.637
>> DEFINITELY.

17:59.637 --> 18:01.470
>> THERE'S GOING TO TO BE A

18:01.470 --> 18:01.970
CANDIDATE BREAK THROUGH.

18:01.970 --> 18:03.136
THERE'S GOING TO BE THAT MOMENT,

18:03.136 --> 18:04.470
YOU KNOW, WHEN BILL CLINTON SAID

18:04.470 --> 18:06.303
I WILL BE WITH YOU UNTIL THE

18:06.303 --> 18:07.637
LAST DOG DIES --

18:07.637 --> 18:09.337
>> I'LL BE WITH YOU UNTIL THE

18:09.337 --> 18:11.670
LAST DOG DIES.

18:11.670 --> 18:13.670
>> RONALD REAGAN, I PAID FOR

18:13.670 --> 18:14.503
THIS MIC.

18:14.503 --> 18:17.236
>> PLEASE TURN MR. REAGAN'S MIC

18:17.236 --> 18:17.970
OFF FOR THE MOMENT.

18:17.970 --> 18:20.904
>> I'M PAYING FOR THIS

18:20.904 --> 18:21.203
MICROPHONE.

18:21.203 --> 18:22.003
>> SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN.

18:22.003 --> 18:23.136
IT'S GOING TO -- LIKE THAT.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.603
IT WILL BE LIKE A FLASH FIRE.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.537
>> YOU SEEM TO ALMOST BE A

18:26.537 --> 18:28.370
SOOTHSAYER FOR SOME OF THE LOWER

18:28.370 --> 18:29.603
TIER CANDIDATES, DON'T GIVE UP

18:29.603 --> 18:30.970
BECAUSE YOU THINK THIS IS ABOUT

18:30.970 --> 18:31.737
PLAYING THE LONG GAME.

18:31.737 --> 18:34.003
>> IT IS.

18:34.003 --> 18:36.403
JIMMY CARTER WAS IN TENTH PLACE

18:36.403 --> 18:37.003
AT THIS TIME.

18:37.003 --> 18:37.470
>> YEAH.

18:37.470 --> 18:37.904
I KNOW.

18:37.904 --> 18:39.170
>> IN TENTH PLACE.

18:39.170 --> 18:39.603
>> YEAH.

18:39.603 --> 18:41.704
HE WON IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE.

18:41.704 --> 18:44.136
>> JIMMY CARTER CLEARLY THE

18:44.136 --> 18:44.904
WINNER, SCORED WELL.

18:44.904 --> 18:45.870
CAME FROM NOWHERE.

18:45.870 --> 18:48.470
>> YOU'VE SEEN A LOT HAPPEN.

18:48.470 --> 18:48.704
>> YEAH.

18:48.704 --> 18:49.804
>> WHAT DOES THIS MOMENT TELL

18:49.804 --> 18:51.103
YOU ABOUT THE COUNTRY?

18:51.103 --> 18:53.503
>> WELL, I'M SAD THAT WE ARE

18:53.503 --> 18:54.203
WHERE WE ARE.

18:54.203 --> 18:55.503
I NEVER THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE A

18:55.503 --> 18:56.770
PRESIDENT THAT WOULD BE THIS BAD

18:56.770 --> 18:58.603
AND THIS EVIL.

18:58.603 --> 19:01.904
TRUMP IS TALKING ABOUT HUNTER AS

19:01.904 --> 19:05.937
CROOKED AS HE IS, IT'S A JOKE.

19:05.937 --> 19:08.236
>> PROBLEM WITH BEING THE

19:08.236 --> 19:08.970
FRONT-RUNNER YOU HAVE THE MOST

19:08.970 --> 19:17.937
TO LOSE, YOU CAN BE IN PERILLESS

19:17.937 --> 19:19.203
SHAPE WEBBING EK TO WEEK.

19:19.203 --> 19:22.003
>> SOMEONE PUNCHES YOU, YOU

19:22.003 --> 19:23.170
PUNCH BACK HARDER.

19:23.170 --> 19:25.537
IT COULD BE A POSITIVE FOR JOE.

19:25.537 --> 19:26.770
JOE GETS THE TOUGHEST WHEN

19:26.770 --> 19:28.603
SOMEONE IS ATTACKING HIS FAMILY.

19:28.603 --> 19:30.003
I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LOVE

19:30.003 --> 19:30.770
A FIGHTER.

19:30.770 --> 19:34.270
>> MM-HMM.

19:34.270 --> 19:35.770
>> WE'RE BACK WITH BREAKING

19:35.770 --> 19:36.036
NEWS.

19:36.036 --> 19:38.870
TWO FOREIGN-BORN TRUMP DONORS

19:38.870 --> 19:40.603
PART OF RUDY GIULIANI'S EFFORTS

19:40.603 --> 19:41.937
TO INVESTIGATE JOE BIDEN HAVE

19:41.937 --> 19:43.170
BEEN ARRESTED.

19:43.170 --> 19:44.637
>> JUST WHEN YOU REALLY THOUGHT

19:44.637 --> 19:46.303
IT COULDN'T GET CRAZIER, STORY

19:46.303 --> 19:51.837
HERE TODAY IS THAT TWO PEOPLE

19:51.837 --> 19:53.003
WHO ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

19:53.003 --> 19:53.804
IMPEACHMENT CONTROVERSY WERE

19:53.804 --> 19:54.870
ARRESTED AT THE AIRPORT TRYING

19:54.870 --> 19:56.270
TO GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

19:56.270 --> 20:00.637
>> THE MEN REPORTEDLY HELPED

20:00.637 --> 20:01.570
GIULIANI MAKE POLITICAL

20:01.570 --> 20:02.303
CONNECTIONS INSIDE UKRAINE.

20:02.303 --> 20:07.770
>> THE CHARGES RELATE TO

20:07.770 --> 20:09.937
DONATIONS BY THESE TWO MEN.

20:09.937 --> 20:12.236
IGOR FRUMAN AND LEV PARNAS.

20:12.236 --> 20:13.203
HOURS BEFORE THEIR ARRESTS,

20:13.203 --> 20:18.970
THESE TWO MEN HAD LUNCH WITH

20:18.970 --> 20:19.637
RUDY GIULIANI IN WASHINGTON AT

20:19.637 --> 20:20.570
THE TRUMP HOE PELL.

20:20.570 --> 20:24.103
>> THEY HAVE AN INDICTMENT FILED

20:24.103 --> 20:26.570
UNDER SEAL AT THE U.S.

20:26.570 --> 20:28.737
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN MANHATTAN.

20:28.737 --> 20:33.337
>> PARNAS AND FRUMAN WERE

20:33.337 --> 20:36.637
ARRESTED LAST NIGHT AS THEY WERE

20:36.637 --> 20:39.403
ABOUT TO BOARD A OFLIGHT WITH

20:39.403 --> 20:39.770
ONE-WAY TICKETS.

20:39.770 --> 20:41.537
I WANT TO ADD THIS INVESTIGATION

20:41.537 --> 20:41.937
IS CONTINUING.

20:41.937 --> 20:44.503
>> IF YOU LOOK AT TODAY'S

20:44.503 --> 20:45.937
EVENTS, THESE TWO INDICTMENTS,

20:45.937 --> 20:48.170
THESE TWO GUYS WERE NOT FIGHTING

20:48.170 --> 20:50.637
CORRUPTION, THEY WERE FOSTERING

20:50.637 --> 20:50.937
CORRUPTION.

20:50.937 --> 20:52.303
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT RUDY

20:52.303 --> 20:54.236
GIULIANI IS USING TO INTRODUCE

20:54.236 --> 20:57.203
HIM TO THE UKRAINE POLITICAL

20:57.203 --> 20:57.437
SYSTEM.

20:57.437 --> 21:02.637
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE -- IT'S

21:02.637 --> 21:05.637
UNBELIEVABLE.

21:05.804 --> 21:07.704
WE THOUGHT WE KNEW THE FACTS,

21:07.704 --> 21:10.036
NOW WE'RE FINDING OUT A FEW MORE

21:10.036 --> 21:11.236
FACTS THAT THERE WAS A LITTLE

21:11.236 --> 21:12.904
BIT MORE GOING ON IN UKRAINE.

21:12.904 --> 21:14.603
AND THEY'RE IN A WORLD OF

21:14.603 --> 21:14.837
TROUBLE.

21:14.837 --> 21:16.537
>> DESPITE ALL THAT, DEMOCRATS

21:16.537 --> 21:17.804
ARE PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF

21:17.804 --> 21:20.136
SCREWING THIS UP, RIGHT?

21:20.136 --> 21:24.136
>> UM, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT --

21:24.136 --> 21:25.970
I'M -- SURE.

21:25.970 --> 21:27.236
YEAH.

21:27.236 --> 21:27.437
SURE.

21:27.437 --> 21:28.804
THERE'S ALWAYS POTENTIAL THEY

21:28.804 --> 21:30.570
COULD SCREW IT UP.

21:30.570 --> 21:32.937
>> DO EITHER ONE OF YOU REMEMBER

21:32.937 --> 21:36.503
THE FIRST TIME YOU REALIZED THAT

21:36.503 --> 21:37.503
PRESIDENT CLINTON MIGHT BE

21:37.503 --> 21:37.870
IMPEACHED?

21:37.870 --> 21:39.837
>> I REMEMBER THAT FIRST WEEK IN

21:39.837 --> 21:43.403
JANUARY WHEN THE STORY WITH

21:43.403 --> 21:47.070
MONICA DRBROKE.

21:47.070 --> 21:47.837
>> I HAD A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

21:47.837 --> 21:50.003
WITH IT, MONICA LEWINSKY WAS MY

21:50.003 --> 21:50.236
INTERN.

21:50.236 --> 21:50.804
>> IS THAT RIGHT?

21:50.804 --> 21:51.337
>> YEAH.

21:51.337 --> 21:52.804
I DIDN'T KNOW IF HE WOULD

21:52.804 --> 21:53.637
SURVIVE THAT FIRST WEEK.

21:53.637 --> 21:55.236
>> THIS WAS ON A WEDNESDAY.

21:55.236 --> 21:56.503
THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY HE

21:56.503 --> 21:59.937
DELIVERED THE STATE OF THE

21:59.937 --> 22:00.136
UNION.

22:00.136 --> 22:01.437
>> BECAUSE OF THE HARD WORK AND

22:01.437 --> 22:03.704
HIGH PURPOSE OF THE AMERICAN

22:03.704 --> 22:06.403
PEOPLE, THESE ARE GOOD TIMES FOR

22:06.403 --> 22:07.103
AMERICA.

22:07.103 --> 22:12.770
>> AND I JUST REMEMBER THINKING,

22:12.770 --> 22:17.437
OH, MY GOD, THIS IS REALLY

22:17.437 --> 22:17.704
HAPPENING.

22:17.704 --> 22:20.770
>> BILL CLINTON GOT A SUBPOENA

22:20.770 --> 22:22.370
FROM KEN STARR THE NEXT DAY.

22:22.370 --> 22:24.370
EVERYBODY WAS SUCKING UP TO AL

22:24.370 --> 22:24.637
GORE.

22:24.637 --> 22:26.170
IT WAS --

22:26.170 --> 22:27.270
>> MIKE PENCE IS PROBABLY

22:27.270 --> 22:28.970
GETTING A LOT OF LOVE RIGHT NOW.

22:28.970 --> 22:30.270
>> IT WAS MR. VICE PRESIDENT,

22:30.270 --> 22:31.970
YOU LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT.

22:31.970 --> 22:33.904
THERE WASN'T A CENTER OF

22:33.904 --> 22:35.303
LEADERSHIP GRAVITY.

22:35.303 --> 22:36.770
>> WHAT'S THE PRACTICAL IMPACT

22:36.770 --> 22:39.503
ON A WHITE HOUSE UNDER

22:39.503 --> 22:39.804
IMPEACHMENT?

22:39.804 --> 22:43.737
>> I WAS TRYING TO, LIKE, STOP

22:43.737 --> 22:45.870
THE ROOM FROM SPINNING.

22:45.870 --> 22:49.370
WE NEEDED TO CONSOLIDATE AND

22:49.370 --> 22:50.570
CONTROL THE STARR INVESTIGATION

22:50.570 --> 22:51.337
AND THE IMPEACHMENT.

22:51.337 --> 22:52.770
SO EVERYBODY ELSE COULD DO THEIR

22:52.770 --> 22:53.370
JOB.

22:53.370 --> 22:56.603
I WAS THE BIG DISCIPLINARIAN AT

22:56.603 --> 22:56.804
THAT.

22:56.804 --> 22:59.904
YOU HAD TO STAY IN YOUR LANE.

22:59.904 --> 23:01.537
IMPEACHMENT WASN'T RAMPANT

23:01.537 --> 23:02.136
THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE.

23:02.136 --> 23:04.403
PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE THEIR TVs

23:04.403 --> 23:05.570
GLUED AND IN FACT, LIKE YOU

23:05.570 --> 23:07.537
WOULD GET A KICK IN THE ASS IF

23:07.537 --> 23:12.203
YOU DID HAVE YOUR TV GLUED TO

23:12.203 --> 23:14.036
ENDLESS CABLE FROM THEN ON THE

23:14.036 --> 23:15.503
PRESIDENT COULD COME INTO THE

23:15.503 --> 23:17.804
OFFICE AND HE COULD SAY WHERE

23:17.804 --> 23:18.337
ARE WE GOING?

23:18.337 --> 23:19.904
WHAT ARE THE EXECUTIVE ACTIONS

23:19.904 --> 23:20.737
WE'RE PURSUING?

23:20.737 --> 23:22.370
WHAT'S OUR FOREIGN POLICY

23:22.370 --> 23:22.837
STRATEGY?

23:22.837 --> 23:25.937
>> HE COULD SHUT IT OUT.

23:25.937 --> 23:26.437
>> HE COULD SHUT IT OUT.

23:26.437 --> 23:28.003
AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT WAS A

23:28.003 --> 23:28.837
GOOD STRATEGY.

23:28.837 --> 23:30.236
THE PUBLIC SENSED THAT HE WAS

23:30.236 --> 23:31.470
STILL DOING HIS JOB.

23:31.470 --> 23:32.770
HE WAS STILL GETTING UP EVERY

23:32.770 --> 23:33.236
DAY.

23:33.236 --> 23:36.603
STILL COMING TO THE OVAL OFFICE.

THEY WANT TO ERASE YOUR VOTE

24:41.837 --> 24:46.437

24:46.437 --> 24:49.970
WHEN ALL OF THEIR LUDICROUS

25:01.837 --> 25:05.036
SO NOW THE DEMOCRATS ARE MAKING

25:15.270 --> 25:16.737
THEY PUT JOE BIDEN IN CHARGE OF

25:16.737 --> 25:17.837
UKRAINE POLICY.

25:17.837 --> 25:18.503
IT'S TRUE.

25:18.503 --> 25:19.270
IT'S TRUE.

25:19.270 --> 25:21.770
AND THEY'RE ALWAYS SAYING THE

25:21.770 --> 25:23.737
SAME THING -- PRESIDENT TRUMP

YOUR FATHER WAS NEVER CONSIDERED

25:53.603 --> 25:53.804
SMART.

25:53.804 --> 25:54.437
HE WAS NEVER CONSIDERED A GOOD

25:54.437 --> 25:54.670
SENATOR.

25:54.670 --> 25:57.970
HE WAS ONLY A VICE PRESIDENT

25:57.970 --> 26:01.070
BECAUSE HE UNDERSTOOD HOW TO

26:01.070 --> 26:08.236
KISS BARACK OBAMA'S ASS.

26:13.537 --> 26:15.203
