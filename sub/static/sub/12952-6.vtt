00:23.623 --> 00:27.684
I could help you become
more powerful than ever.

00:30.296 --> 00:32.958
You've told Bomani
you'd work for The Covenant?

00:33.033 --> 00:34.533
Yes.

00:34.534 --> 00:38.402
And now I'm telling you I'm in
a position to be a double agent,

00:38.471 --> 00:42.464
working for The Covenant
but loyal to the CIA.

00:42.542 --> 00:43.675
What is it, Sydney?

00:43.676 --> 00:46.176
This is classic.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.614
There.
You see that?

00:48.615 --> 00:52.415
He's saying "Jewel" or "Julie. "
Maybe "Julia. "

00:52.485 --> 00:53.519
What videotape?

00:53.520 --> 00:56.421
The videotape that clearly
identifies Sydney

00:56.489 --> 00:59.515
as the murderer of a Russian
diplomat, Andrian Lazarey.

01:01.461 --> 01:05.090
I'm withholding this
information from the NSC.

01:05.165 --> 01:08.362
That means, Agent Vaughn,
that you are prohibited

01:08.435 --> 01:10.102
from discussing this
with your wife.

01:10.103 --> 01:11.670
Is that understood?

01:11.671 --> 01:12.838
Yeah.

01:12.839 --> 01:18.971
Vaughn, I have to know
where I was and who Julia is.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.780
What I did.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.359
<i># You ain't nothing to me #</i>

01:34.360 --> 01:36.988
<i># If you got nothing to say #</i>

01:39.032 --> 01:40.866
<i># I don't know what you got #</i>

01:40.867 --> 01:43.367
<i># That I can use anyway #</i>

01:46.206 --> 01:48.706
<i># Last chance, honey #</i>

01:50.210 --> 01:51.810
Hello, Sydney.

01:51.811 --> 01:55.178
<i># Yeah, this is
your last chance, honey #</i>

01:56.149 --> 01:58.250
<i># Last chance, honey #</i>

01:58.251 --> 02:00.751
What do you want?

02:02.755 --> 02:05.315
The Covenant
is about to make a move.

02:09.996 --> 02:13.193
If you have intel, protocol is
you pass it through Lauren Reed.

02:13.266 --> 02:15.000
She's your handler.

02:15.001 --> 02:17.868
Well, Ms. Reed is very able,

02:17.937 --> 02:20.105
but I'm afraid she cannot
possibly comprehend

02:20.106 --> 02:23.598
the intricacies of serving
two masters simultaneously.

02:23.676 --> 02:26.176
You were brilliant at it.

02:26.346 --> 02:30.612
The way you would walk into
my office, look me in the eyes

02:30.683 --> 02:33.118
and lie to me.

02:33.119 --> 02:36.555
For me to succeed in my work as
a double agent for The Covenant,

02:36.623 --> 02:38.624
I'll need your help.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.292
Your needs don't concern me.

02:40.293 --> 02:43.387
You'll find the details
on toureurope. Eu.

02:44.297 --> 02:46.532
It's encoded in the photo
of the Vatican.

02:46.533 --> 02:51.334
Password is "Credit Dauphine,"
for old times' sake.

02:53.206 --> 02:55.706
Clever.

03:00.213 --> 03:02.247
Hmm.

03:02.248 --> 03:04.748
I miss L.A.

03:08.588 --> 03:11.088
I miss Emily.

03:11.424 --> 03:14.086
I miss the friendship
with your father.

03:16.429 --> 03:18.929
I miss your confidence
and trust.

03:20.266 --> 03:23.360
Perhaps I can get it back
someday?

03:25.171 --> 03:29.267
You will never have
my confidence and trust.

03:30.510 --> 03:34.241
Or my father's friendship
and respect.

03:34.314 --> 03:36.814
Ever.

03:40.453 --> 03:43.547
You don't want any Weiss on ice!
Come on, buddy!

03:43.623 --> 03:45.624
All right, I wasn't ready.

03:45.625 --> 03:48.125
Wait until I say
the words "I'm ready. "

03:48.795 --> 03:51.559
Whoa!
Hey! Hey!

03:51.631 --> 03:54.131
Hey, hey, hey!

03:54.200 --> 03:56.700
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

03:59.105 --> 04:01.605
My brother used to do this.

04:01.641 --> 04:03.308
Do what?

04:03.309 --> 04:05.777
Shut down like you're doing.
Get all quiet.

04:05.778 --> 04:08.247
- That's not what I'm doing.
- He'd deny it, too.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.581
And then he'd brood and
get mopey like you're doing.

04:11.651 --> 04:12.751
Finally it got too much for him.

04:12.752 --> 04:15.482
He had to tell me
what the problem was.

04:19.158 --> 04:22.093
It's been 3 weeks since I found
out Sydney murdered Lazarey.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.631
I've been lying to my wife
for 3 weeks.

04:25.632 --> 04:26.598
Come on, man.

04:26.599 --> 04:30.365
I know guys that lie to their
wives for longer than that.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.337
You understand your brother
didn't like talking to you

04:32.338 --> 04:34.838
because you say
stupid things, right?

04:35.441 --> 04:39.741
Listen, you were ordered
not to say anything, right?

04:39.812 --> 04:41.513
This isn't your choice.

04:41.514 --> 04:43.282
And she was ordered to find out
who murdered Lazarey.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.016
That's my point.

04:44.017 --> 04:47.111
I'm engaged in preventing her
from doing her job.

04:48.021 --> 04:51.047
She's gonna find out.
I mean, you know she is.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.858
And that you're protecting
Sydney.

04:52.859 --> 04:54.860
Yeah.

04:54.861 --> 04:56.461
See where I'm going with this?

04:56.462 --> 04:58.864
Well, this is why
people from the CIA

04:58.865 --> 05:00.465
should not get married
to people from the NSC.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.966
Don't poop where you sleep.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.503
Thanks a lot.

05:04.504 --> 05:06.471
Ohh! Okay.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.473
All right, you know what?

05:08.474 --> 05:10.974
That hurts.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.649
This is where Lange will be.

05:21.254 --> 05:22.554
I'll take care of it.

05:22.555 --> 05:27.254
It must be done a certain way.
There is an extraction required.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.662
I assume you've stamped out
the details.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.030
Your partner's been briefed.

05:32.031 --> 05:34.795
My partner?
I don't think so.

05:34.867 --> 05:37.367
This is not a request.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.438
Look, if you
don't trust me by now,

05:39.439 --> 05:41.807
perhaps you should be
in business with someone else.

05:41.808 --> 05:44.308
And you can tell that to San'ko.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.979
We logged on to Tour Europe
and downloaded Sloane's intel.

05:55.621 --> 05:58.283
The Covenant is after a device
that will give them access

05:58.358 --> 06:00.625
to Russia's strategic arsenal.

06:00.626 --> 06:03.595
It was designed by this man,
Robert Lange,

06:03.663 --> 06:06.461
hardware engineer
for a German security firm.

06:06.532 --> 06:10.059
Lange was approached by someone
posing as a Russian official.

06:10.136 --> 06:13.299
They contracted him to design
a test for security flaws

06:13.373 --> 06:15.440
in their nuclear command
and control system.

06:15.441 --> 06:18.433
This guy, Lange, created
this really cool device.

06:18.511 --> 06:21.969
Basically, take it to any
missile silo in all of Russia,

06:22.048 --> 06:24.483
and it interfaces with
the launch-control console

06:24.484 --> 06:26.718
and bypasses
all security protocols.

06:26.719 --> 06:30.177
Initiation codes,
the commander's launch key,

06:30.256 --> 06:30.989
irrelevant.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.191
It's a skeleton key
for Russia's nuclear weapons?

06:33.192 --> 06:35.922
Yeah, and to be honest,
I'm just a little bit jealous.

06:35.995 --> 06:37.896
Did he deliver it
to The Covenant?

06:37.897 --> 06:39.664
No, he discovered the man
who hired him

06:39.665 --> 06:41.767
wasn't actually Russian defense.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.835
Lange went on the run
to prevent The Covenant

06:43.836 --> 06:45.270
from getting what he'd invented.

06:45.271 --> 06:47.771
This is a picture
of what he used to look like.

06:47.807 --> 06:49.474
According to Sloane's intel,

06:49.475 --> 06:51.476
Lange has surgically
altered his appearance

06:51.477 --> 06:53.445
to hide from The Covenant.

06:53.446 --> 06:56.973
We know that tomorrow Lange
is scheduled to meet this man,

06:57.049 --> 07:00.177
Heinrich Strauss,
at the Club Delphi in Milan.

07:00.286 --> 07:02.120
He's picking up
new identity papers.

07:02.121 --> 07:04.885
Remember, Sloane's intel
came from The Covenant,

07:04.957 --> 07:09.087
so obviously they're looking to
grab Lange and the skeleton key.

07:09.162 --> 07:13.258
Sydney and Vaughn, you need to
get Lange before The Covenant.

07:13.332 --> 07:16.426
You'll leave tonight.
Marshall will go over op-tech.

07:17.069 --> 07:19.936
Lauren, Sydney, I need a moment.

07:25.077 --> 07:28.103
Given the current situation,
I need to make a change.

07:30.983 --> 07:34.043
I want you to take over
as Sloane's handler.

07:34.987 --> 07:37.155
No. I'm sorry.
That is not a good idea.

07:37.156 --> 07:38.890
While it's not my favorite job,

07:38.891 --> 07:40.992
can I ask why
I'm being replaced?

07:40.993 --> 07:42.160
It's not an indictment.

07:42.161 --> 07:45.096
It's that Sydney is more
familiar with the players.

07:45.998 --> 07:47.666
What players?
There's Sloane and Sark.

07:47.667 --> 07:50.898
- That's it.
- No, there's another.

07:53.272 --> 07:57.766
Sydney, Allison Doren is alive.

08:05.051 --> 08:07.551
She's alive?

08:11.457 --> 08:13.957
You can thank me later.

08:37.316 --> 08:39.816
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

09:16.622 --> 09:19.648
I truly thought you were dead
the last two years.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.225
You have to start
at the beginning.

09:22.461 --> 09:25.521
Or the end,
after the last time I saw you.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.595
Will Tippin discovered
what had happened.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.803
That his girlfriend
had been killed

09:31.804 --> 09:34.304
and I had been doubled
to take her place.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.408
He had to be eliminated.

09:40.813 --> 09:43.313
What happened with Bristow?

09:43.916 --> 09:46.908
When The Covenant found you,
you were both unconscious.

09:47.820 --> 09:50.255
I can only remember that
in bits and pieces.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.884
She came home.

09:55.161 --> 09:57.661
I realized that she knew.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.441
She aimed the gun at me.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.540
The next thing I remember,
it was three weeks later,

10:16.616 --> 10:20.279
and I woke up in a Covenant-run
hospital outside Marseilles.

10:21.354 --> 10:24.016
It took me six months
to fully recover.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.482
I've been working with them
ever since.

10:28.127 --> 10:31.619
Were you behind them
extracting me from the CIA?

10:31.697 --> 10:34.222
I wish I could claim credit
for that.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.134
I only learned you were
working with us recently.

10:39.205 --> 10:42.697
My tenure began shortly
after my father's murder.

10:44.977 --> 10:48.105
They freed me in exchange
for my inheritance.

10:49.882 --> 10:52.382
Who killed your father?

10:53.486 --> 10:55.986
I don't know.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.989
But I intend to find out.

11:07.767 --> 11:10.668
Bristow should have to pay
for these scars.

11:14.273 --> 11:16.773
She will.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.381
I'm no longer Sloane's handler.

11:23.382 --> 11:25.784
Dixon gave that job
to Sydney Bristow.

11:25.785 --> 11:27.018
Good.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.954
That frees you up to focus
on the Lazarey murder.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.023
We have a source working
inside the Russian government

11:32.024 --> 11:33.458
who's agreed to help us out.

11:33.459 --> 11:34.759
They have the assassin's
identity?

11:34.760 --> 11:37.285
Not yet, but apparently
they hold information

11:37.363 --> 11:38.430
that could lead us to it.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.699
Then why aren't they using it?

11:40.700 --> 11:42.300
Lazarey is a Russian diplomat.

11:42.301 --> 11:44.202
You'd think they'd want
that answer more than us.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.370
The Covenant
doesn't want anyone to know

11:45.371 --> 11:47.472
they're behind
the assassination.

11:47.473 --> 11:49.374
And your source believes
their reach extends

11:49.375 --> 11:50.975
so deep inside
the Russian government

11:50.976 --> 11:52.510
that they can make that happen.

11:52.511 --> 11:53.812
You leave tonight.

11:53.813 --> 11:57.806
Any leak, and our source
could be compromised and killed.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.920
No one from the CIA can know
about this,

12:01.921 --> 12:04.421
including your husband.

12:10.162 --> 12:11.996
Vienna.

12:11.997 --> 12:14.989
Yeah, I know.
Surprised me, too.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.268
For how long?

12:17.269 --> 12:20.705
Well, you know how they go.
It's a NATO security briefing.

12:20.773 --> 12:23.273
Two days at the most.

12:24.777 --> 12:27.769
I'm surprised Lindsey reassigned
you to cover a briefing.

12:27.847 --> 12:29.848
I know, but he said
he needs me there.

12:29.849 --> 12:32.349
Couldn't exactly say no,
could I?

12:37.456 --> 12:39.956
What about Milan?

12:40.960 --> 12:43.861
Should be a quick turnaround.
I'll be back in a day.

12:51.203 --> 12:54.969
When we get back,
when we're done with this,

12:55.040 --> 12:57.540
we need to go away.

12:57.710 --> 12:58.977
Desert?

12:58.978 --> 13:01.478
Anywhere.

13:06.152 --> 13:08.353
My superior indicated,
Mr. Tupikov,

13:08.354 --> 13:11.118
that you have
some information for us.

13:11.991 --> 13:14.516
How does a British woman
become an American spy?

13:14.593 --> 13:17.093
I'm not a spy.

13:17.096 --> 13:21.192
And though I grew up in London,
I was born in the United States.

13:21.267 --> 13:24.532
Now that you know my life story,
I have some questions.

13:24.603 --> 13:27.766
Your government's running
a probe into this.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.866
I would think you want to bring
closure to your investigation.

13:30.943 --> 13:32.010
Why come to us?

13:32.011 --> 13:33.611
I explained this
to your superiors.

13:33.612 --> 13:36.112
I want to hear it for myself.

13:39.518 --> 13:43.386
Andrian and I were colleagues

13:43.455 --> 13:46.947
since our time together
at St. Petersburg University.

13:47.026 --> 13:48.393
I'm sorry.

13:48.394 --> 13:50.795
I have, for some time now,

13:50.796 --> 13:52.497
suspected the existence
of a mole,

13:52.498 --> 13:54.566
whom I believe is still loyal
to The Covenant.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.263
This is a file
of digital recordings,

13:57.336 --> 13:59.170
all of which chronicle
hundreds of phone calls

13:59.171 --> 14:03.005
made or received by our deceased
diplomat, Andrian Lazarey.

14:04.810 --> 14:08.177
Perhaps the murderer can be
traced through these calls.

14:09.148 --> 14:12.083
I trust you will see justice
done for my murdered comrade.

14:12.151 --> 14:14.651
Where can I contact you?

14:17.423 --> 14:19.923
You can't.

14:20.593 --> 14:23.093
We never had this conversation.

14:35.107 --> 14:38.008
So, that camera Marshall gave us
is a miniaturized X-ray camera.

14:38.077 --> 14:41.274
How much you want to bet
this thing's leaking radiation?

14:48.621 --> 14:51.121
So we're looking for Lange.

14:52.291 --> 14:55.385
Yeah, the camera's supposed
to I.D. His plastic surgery.

14:57.696 --> 14:59.964
It will transmit images
back to my PDA

14:59.965 --> 15:02.300
that Marshall programmed
to identify fractures,

15:02.301 --> 15:04.569
scar tissue, or implants.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.070
Anyone who's been
under the knife.

15:10.142 --> 15:11.910
You okay?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.411
Mm-hmm.

15:15.648 --> 15:18.148
Is it Allison?

15:18.851 --> 15:25.848
Since I learned that she's
alive, I just keep wondering...

15:25.925 --> 15:28.587
does she still look like her?

15:28.661 --> 15:31.161
Does she look like Francie?

15:34.833 --> 15:38.769
Because if she does, as much as
I know I should keep her alive

15:38.837 --> 15:45.106
to maybe try to figure out
the last two years of my life,

15:45.177 --> 15:50.046
all I'll want to do is kill her.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.354
Heinrich Strauss.

15:56.355 --> 15:59.791
He's the man providing Lange
with identity papers.

15:59.858 --> 16:02.588
As we speak, he's getting drunk
in the club.

16:03.896 --> 16:06.396
I'll keep an eye on him.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.466
The camera's in the stone.

16:10.569 --> 16:12.570
Do you mind?

16:12.571 --> 16:15.071
No.

16:30.756 --> 16:33.256
Thank you.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.431
Let's go.

16:45.504 --> 16:48.004
Let's go.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.013
Okay, we're looking
for someone

16:55.014 --> 16:56.948
with massive
facial reconstruction.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.384
Lange's about 5' 10", 170 pounds.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.252
How's the camera working?

17:01.253 --> 17:03.753
The video's linking up now.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.626
Signal strength's at 100%.

17:10.229 --> 17:11.963
I'll start looking for Lange.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.464
Hey, check out
that guy to your left.

17:19.338 --> 17:21.838
Buy me a drink?

17:31.717 --> 17:34.217
Nothing.

17:36.155 --> 17:38.655
I love this song.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.583
Okay, nothing there.
Keep moving.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.160
Oh, check out the guy
with no rhythm.

17:51.203 --> 17:54.036
No, only a nose job.
Not enough to be Lange.

17:59.445 --> 18:02.846
Chin implant at 3:00.
Collagen lips straight ahead.

18:04.650 --> 18:07.150
Okay, those breasts are real.

18:09.788 --> 18:13.053
- Should I get my nose done?
- Maybe a little tapering.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.226
Get the bump removed?

18:15.227 --> 18:17.727
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.
Go back.

18:17.963 --> 18:19.630
Go back to your left.
2:00.

18:19.631 --> 18:20.998
- There?
- Yeah, yeah.

18:20.999 --> 18:22.633
Hold it.
Just like that.

18:22.634 --> 18:26.195
Okay, nose, chin, cheek lift,
eye config.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.771
That's Lange.

18:28.974 --> 18:31.474
And there's Strauss.

18:33.579 --> 18:36.207
He just got his identity papers.

18:37.149 --> 18:39.649
Someone has a laser sight
on him!

18:48.594 --> 18:51.358
Vaughn, Allison's the shooter!
She's up in the balcony!

18:51.430 --> 18:53.930
I'm on my way!

19:00.672 --> 19:02.373
Wait, Lange!

19:02.374 --> 19:04.874
Don't move!

19:15.554 --> 19:17.121
Lange ran out!
I'm pinned down!

19:17.122 --> 19:19.622
Vaughn, where are you?

19:19.892 --> 19:22.392
I'm on the balcony.

19:34.306 --> 19:36.073
- Do you see her?
- No, she took off.

19:36.074 --> 19:38.574
- I'm going after her.
- I'm going after Lange.

19:52.491 --> 19:54.991
Hello.

20:09.074 --> 20:11.574
Aah!

20:19.451 --> 20:21.452
Sydney, she went down
the elevator shaft.

20:21.453 --> 20:22.453
She has Lange.

20:22.454 --> 20:25.014
- What floor is she on?
- The basement.

20:58.657 --> 21:01.421
- Why didn't she kill me?
- Maybe she likes you.

21:01.493 --> 21:03.993
- Weiss, I'm serious.
- So am I.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.330
Come on, she lived with you
for months.

21:06.331 --> 21:08.266
She doubled herself
as your best friend.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.031
Maybe in that time, she actually
started to like you.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.436
I can see that happening.

21:12.437 --> 21:13.971
It was like she needed
to keep me alive.

21:13.972 --> 21:16.107
I know this sounds weird,
but it felt like

21:16.108 --> 21:18.242
she had been ordered
not to kill me.

21:18.243 --> 21:19.343
Well, that's lucky.

21:19.344 --> 21:21.412
I want to know how she survived
your fight two years ago.

21:21.413 --> 21:22.913
You shot her three times.

21:22.914 --> 21:25.712
- So, she took this guy's tooth?
- She took the guy's tooth.

21:25.784 --> 21:27.285
Just when you think the world
can't get weirder.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.185
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:28.186 --> 21:29.954
Have we checked the records
to see what's strange

21:29.955 --> 21:30.955
about his teeth?

21:30.956 --> 21:34.289
Langley cross-checked all files.
They had nothing.

21:34.359 --> 21:37.453
- But then Lauren was a genius.
- Genius isn't quite what I was.

21:37.529 --> 21:39.430
What did you do?
I miss all the good briefings.

21:39.431 --> 21:41.499
Lauren realized we had
Lange's X-rays,

21:41.500 --> 21:43.968
and we could use them to figure
out what was in his tooth.

21:43.969 --> 21:46.904
The X-cam, Marshall's necklace.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.806
We used it to see
who had plastic surgery.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.970
- I took the pictures myself.
- Nice.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.878
I have a meeting with the NSC.

21:53.879 --> 21:56.379
I'll walk you out.

21:58.450 --> 22:00.151
Vaughn's right.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.253
The question isn't
why she didn't kill you.

22:02.254 --> 22:04.848
It's "how come she's still
alive at all?"

22:04.923 --> 22:06.157
Maybe Allison's a werewolf.

22:06.158 --> 22:09.423
Maybe the only way to kill her
is with a silver bullet.

22:09.494 --> 22:10.494
Yeah.

22:10.495 --> 22:11.929
Okay, if you look here,

22:11.930 --> 22:15.093
this is Lange's jaw
before his tooth was removed.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.261
If we look here,
that looks like a normal filling

22:18.337 --> 22:20.104
that one would have
after having a cavity.

22:20.105 --> 22:22.699
Get it filled, too much sugar
and not flossing...

22:22.774 --> 22:24.775
which I do every day,
twice a day.

22:24.776 --> 22:26.510
But upon further examination,

22:26.511 --> 22:29.947
I actually magnified it
over a thousand times,

22:30.015 --> 22:32.779
and it's actually an RFID chip.

22:32.851 --> 22:36.548
Now, RFID stands for
radio frequency identification.

22:36.621 --> 22:38.222
Flinkman, you know
what would be great?

22:38.223 --> 22:39.223
English.

22:39.224 --> 22:41.592
Oh, right. I forgot.
You're not that astute.

22:41.593 --> 22:43.494
Okay, what can I...

22:43.495 --> 22:45.995
Oh, you guys are familiar
with the "quick pass" things

22:46.031 --> 22:47.698
you'd use at gas stations.

22:47.699 --> 22:50.964
Come on the key chains.
Actually, I think I have one.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.104
Need a visual demonstration.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.039
You know,
this little thing right here

22:55.040 --> 22:57.274
that lets you pay
for your gas at the pump.

22:57.275 --> 22:59.176
Then you don't have to use
your credit card...

22:59.177 --> 23:00.277
- Marshall.
- Yeah?

23:00.278 --> 23:01.779
We're familiar with those.

23:01.780 --> 23:03.781
Lange has something like that
in his tooth?

23:03.782 --> 23:06.580
Sort of, although it doesn't
work at the gas station.

23:06.651 --> 23:08.285
Though, if it did,
it would be wicked cool.

23:08.286 --> 23:11.551
We believe Lange used this
to open a high-security lock.

23:11.623 --> 23:13.424
Yes, and I believe Lange kept

23:13.425 --> 23:15.426
this missile-launching device
locked up

23:15.427 --> 23:17.862
and used this tooth
to open the vault.

23:17.863 --> 23:20.097
Or briefcase.
This device could be anywhere.

23:20.098 --> 23:22.333
We have to assume The Covenant
has the location.

23:22.334 --> 23:25.235
As far as we know, they could
have the device already.

23:25.303 --> 23:26.837
Sloane's our man
in The Covenant,

23:26.838 --> 23:29.807
so I assume
there's a plane waiting.

23:34.112 --> 23:35.513
How do I know
what I'm looking for?

23:35.514 --> 23:37.648
I've supplied you with the time
and date of Lazarey's murder.

23:37.649 --> 23:41.210
Screen all calls made
in the weeks leading up to it.

23:41.286 --> 23:42.987
We think the killer
is someone he expected.

23:42.988 --> 23:44.755
Was Lazarey killed
by a man or a woman?

23:44.756 --> 23:46.190
A woman.

23:46.191 --> 23:48.459
It'll take awhile to filter
all these calls.

23:48.460 --> 23:51.952
Calls with a red flag, run them
through voiceprint analysis.

23:52.030 --> 23:55.124
Maybe we can make a positive
I.D. On one of these callers.

24:00.205 --> 24:02.139
Sydney Bristow
to see Arvin Sloane.

24:02.140 --> 24:05.132
<i>Ja, he's been expecting you.
Right this way.</i>

24:06.311 --> 24:08.612
Yes, of course, Mr. Secretary.

24:08.613 --> 24:12.049
I will. I'd be happy to speak
with the delegation from UNESCO

24:12.117 --> 24:14.617
at their convenience.

24:14.653 --> 24:17.087
Just let me know.
Thank you.

24:17.088 --> 24:19.588
Give my regards to Nani.

24:19.925 --> 24:21.592
Yes. Bye.

24:21.593 --> 24:22.927
Sydney, I was very pleased

24:22.928 --> 24:25.920
when Dixon said that
you agreed to be my handler.

24:25.997 --> 24:28.522
It was an assignment,
not an agreement.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.728
The way a janitor doesn't
agree to clean a toilet.

24:32.604 --> 24:36.267
But as your handler, you'll do
what I say when I say.

24:36.341 --> 24:37.975
I select your assignments.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.476
I design your missions.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.872
I control you,
not the other way around.

24:43.949 --> 24:46.850
Is that what you
used to let Vaughn do?

24:48.286 --> 24:49.453
Control you?

24:49.454 --> 24:51.522
The intel you provided
was accurate.

24:51.523 --> 24:53.357
The Covenant is in pursuit
of a device

24:53.358 --> 24:56.088
that will give them access
to Russia's strategic weapons.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.162
You failed to get Lange,
didn't you?

24:58.163 --> 25:00.364
Lange is dead.

25:00.365 --> 25:02.299
The Covenant has an access code

25:02.300 --> 25:05.098
we assume will open a vault
that contains this device.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.471
I see. And you know
the location of this vault?

25:07.472 --> 25:10.407
No, but Sark and Allison do,

25:10.475 --> 25:13.069
and you're going to get them
to give it to you.

25:13.144 --> 25:15.644
Allison.

25:15.981 --> 25:19.974
I was wondering
when Allison would resurface.

25:21.419 --> 25:23.254
I'm sorry, Sydney.

25:23.255 --> 25:27.191
I can only imagine
that seeing Allison

25:27.259 --> 25:29.759
must be very painful for you.

25:30.762 --> 25:34.095
You will set up a meeting
with Sark and Allison.

25:34.165 --> 25:37.259
You'll explain that their travel
plans have been compromised.

25:37.335 --> 25:39.929
You'll offer assistance
in revising their arrangements.

25:40.005 --> 25:41.906
And pass the information
on to you?

25:41.907 --> 25:45.035
That won't be necessary.
You'll be wearing a wire.

25:46.778 --> 25:49.278
And if they discover
that it's a setup?

25:51.850 --> 25:54.375
Then I get to hear them
kill you.

26:02.794 --> 26:04.194
I went through the disk.

26:04.195 --> 26:06.857
There were 300 calls, and about
12% of them were encrypted,

26:06.932 --> 26:09.066
including this one
from the day before the murder.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.601
Yes, this is Andrian.

26:10.602 --> 26:11.902
Hello, it's me.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.971
- Hello.
- About the stock transfer...

26:13.972 --> 26:17.908
So I trust that you've located
a safe place to park the asset.

26:17.976 --> 26:18.642
I have.

26:18.643 --> 26:21.737
When would you come by
to discuss the particulars?

26:21.813 --> 26:23.581
Can you make time
tomorrow at 3:00?

26:23.582 --> 26:26.346
Of course. I look
forward to seeing you then.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.918
That has to be the killer.
He was murdered at 3: 15.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.321
I ran it through analysis.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.156
The woman's voice
has been altered.

26:32.157 --> 26:33.991
Can you restore the original?

26:33.992 --> 26:36.492
No, it was altered
at the source.

26:36.561 --> 26:39.223
I was able to access
the Russian telephone exchange.

26:39.297 --> 26:42.027
- So you can do a trace.
- I already did.

26:42.100 --> 26:45.228
See, whoever placed the call
did an amazing job.

26:45.303 --> 26:49.034
They routed to Lazarey's PB X
via a defunct satellite network,

26:49.107 --> 26:51.667
through the Internet,
VOIP gateway,

26:51.743 --> 26:55.440
and over a landline at a secure
telephone at this address.

26:55.513 --> 26:56.513
London.

26:56.514 --> 26:58.482
34 Trenton Place.

26:58.483 --> 26:59.950
Knightsbridge.

26:59.951 --> 27:02.451
A company called
K.N.G. Microtech.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.954
Good job.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.415
I found the office
where the phone call originated.

27:31.416 --> 27:34.112
It's been empty for some time.
I spoke to the leasing agent.

27:34.185 --> 27:35.419
According to their records,

27:35.420 --> 27:37.920
this office was leased
a year ago, November 24th.

27:37.989 --> 27:39.823
A 4-year lease paid in advance.

27:39.824 --> 27:42.349
- Was there a name on the lease?
- Yes, there was.

27:42.427 --> 27:45.260
I believe she's the person
who killed Lazarey.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.830
Her name is Julia Thorne.

27:56.941 --> 27:59.143
I feel like a field agent again.

27:59.144 --> 28:01.378
Do you have a 20
on the targets?

28:01.379 --> 28:04.143
I've never told you about
my time with the agency, have I?

28:04.215 --> 28:06.216
Yes or no?

28:06.217 --> 28:08.485
I was very patriotic once.

28:08.486 --> 28:10.986
No one's asking.

28:11.456 --> 28:13.956
Here they are.

28:15.627 --> 28:18.127
Mr. Sark.

28:18.830 --> 28:21.330
Allison.

28:21.633 --> 28:24.133
You're looking well.

28:24.469 --> 28:26.969
I look like someone else.

28:27.806 --> 28:29.740
When you hired me
to undergo gene therapy,

28:29.741 --> 28:32.574
you promised you could
reverse-engineer the process.

28:33.144 --> 28:35.669
Ah, but Sydney Bristow
destroyed the technology

28:35.747 --> 28:39.513
that would have allowed us
to return you.

28:40.085 --> 28:42.119
I'm sorry for your loss.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.620
You indicated it was
important we meet.

28:45.256 --> 28:46.790
The CIA is onto you.

28:46.791 --> 28:48.759
My sources tell me
the agency knows

28:48.760 --> 28:51.820
that you extracted
an RFID chip from Mr. Lange.

28:51.896 --> 28:55.559
The plane that you chartered
is under surveillance.

28:57.836 --> 28:59.169
As counsel to The Covenant,

28:59.170 --> 29:02.037
I suggest that you move up
your timetable.

29:02.107 --> 29:03.607
If you let me know
where you need to go,

29:03.608 --> 29:05.776
I'll have a plane waiting
within the hour.

29:05.777 --> 29:07.711
- He's lying.
- Allison.

29:07.712 --> 29:11.079
No, she's a wonderful
judge of character.

29:11.950 --> 29:14.646
Sydney Bristow found you
in Milan.

29:14.719 --> 29:17.745
If I were a betting man,
I'd say she'd find you again.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.890
I'm simply here to help.

29:22.627 --> 29:25.127
There's no way
Sark's gonna go for this.

29:26.397 --> 29:28.232
We're going to Bulgaria.

29:28.233 --> 29:30.733
The device is in a vault
in Sofia.

29:31.069 --> 29:33.663
What did I tell you?
This is the best plan ever.

29:33.738 --> 29:35.405
I can get you there first thing.

29:35.406 --> 29:36.573
Tomorrow morning.

29:36.574 --> 29:38.308
Done.

29:38.309 --> 29:40.744
Then our business here
is complete.

29:40.745 --> 29:43.908
Ask them where I've been
the last two years.

29:43.982 --> 29:46.450
I'll call you as soon as
the arrangements are complete.

29:46.451 --> 29:49.181
Ask them, or I'll send
feedback through your comm

29:49.254 --> 29:52.121
so loud they'll hear it
and know you're wired.

29:52.657 --> 29:54.458
At which point they'll kill you.

29:54.459 --> 29:57.087
Sucks being a double agent,
doesn't it?

29:57.162 --> 29:59.429
You know, Allison,
I'm thinking...

29:59.430 --> 30:01.799
Seeing you again,
I'm reminded of the things

30:01.800 --> 30:04.360
that happened
over the past two years.

30:04.435 --> 30:06.003
I'm curious.

30:06.004 --> 30:08.700
Have you and Sydney Bristow
crossed paths?

30:10.108 --> 30:11.008
Why?

30:11.009 --> 30:13.603
I heard you had an opportunity
to kill her in Milan

30:13.678 --> 30:15.946
and that you didn't take it.

30:15.947 --> 30:18.282
The Covenant asked me not to.

30:18.283 --> 30:20.979
Really?
Why is that?

30:21.052 --> 30:24.078
They want to retrieve something,
something in her memory.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.885
Something she saw?
Something she experienced?

30:26.958 --> 30:29.756
I don't know.
I'm as curious as you are.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.328
Something you saw.
What the hell is that?

30:33.364 --> 30:35.864
I have no idea.

30:36.801 --> 30:38.535
- We've been over this.
- I know.

30:38.536 --> 30:41.300
The NSC techniques to recapture
my memory are invasive.

30:41.372 --> 30:42.873
Invasive is too benign a word.

30:42.874 --> 30:44.474
We're talking
about surgical procedures

30:44.475 --> 30:46.710
that could leave you
with permanent brain damage.

30:46.711 --> 30:49.046
Allison said The Covenant
wants to access something I saw.

30:49.047 --> 30:51.547
And we'll discover
what that is in time.

30:51.549 --> 30:55.986
Dad, I am walking around with
a secret in my head so fantastic

30:56.054 --> 30:58.554
that Covenant operatives have
been ordered not to kill me.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.390
- I need to know what that is.
- I understand.

31:00.391 --> 31:02.659
But we're not doing it
like that.

31:02.660 --> 31:05.424
How do you propose we do it?
I'm losing my mind!

31:05.496 --> 31:09.262
I just got off the phone with
our N.I.S. Liaison in Sofia.

31:09.334 --> 31:10.834
Once Allison's plane lands,

31:10.835 --> 31:12.936
you and Vaughn will coordinate
with local authorities

31:12.937 --> 31:14.771
and track her to the vault.

31:14.772 --> 31:17.798
We'll wait until she retrieves
the device, then apprehend her.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.376
- I understand.
- You leave at once.

31:22.847 --> 31:25.782
- Is there a problem with that?
- No, there isn't.

31:25.850 --> 31:28.350
I'll go over op-tech
with Marshall.

31:32.857 --> 31:34.958
I want you clear
on the rules of engagement.

31:34.959 --> 31:36.460
Yes, I know.

31:36.461 --> 31:38.961
Allison is another link
to The Covenant.

31:38.963 --> 31:40.530
She is part
of our larger agenda,

31:40.531 --> 31:42.599
and as such,
is not to be killed.

31:42.600 --> 31:43.867
I want her dead.

31:43.868 --> 31:45.035
What?

31:45.036 --> 31:48.301
The order from Langley is
to bring her in dead or alive.

31:48.806 --> 31:51.468
She killed my wife.
She killed your best friend.

31:51.542 --> 31:54.238
So I look at this
as an opportunity.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.980
The only reason I hesitated
before was I hoped

31:57.982 --> 32:00.384
that she might
have information for you.

32:00.385 --> 32:04.253
But now that we know
there's no hope for that,

32:04.322 --> 32:06.822
I want that bitch dead.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.900
You want to track
Allison, right?

32:16.901 --> 32:19.768
Well, I came up with
a solution to that problem.

32:19.837 --> 32:22.397
The chip inside Lange's tooth,
it uses a frequency signature,

32:22.473 --> 32:24.174
and that's how it
unlocks the vault

32:24.175 --> 32:26.410
that contains his
missile-launching device.

32:26.411 --> 32:27.644
You explained this.

32:27.645 --> 32:30.145
Now, this thing will
hone in on the frequency

32:30.148 --> 32:33.549
and lead us to Allison, and
she will lead us to the device.

32:33.618 --> 32:36.610
Oh, however, I wasn't really
sure exactly the frequency

32:36.688 --> 32:40.852
that the chip transmits on,
so I covered a broader spectrum.

32:40.925 --> 32:44.554
- Is that gonna be a problem?
- No. No, not really.

32:44.629 --> 32:46.096
All right, kind of.

32:46.097 --> 32:49.692
It might be set off by microwave
ovens, so I would steer clear

32:49.767 --> 32:52.600
of pancake houses of
the international variety.

32:52.670 --> 32:53.670
Got it.

32:53.671 --> 32:56.367
Whoa. See, the Eprom chip
isn't finished burning,

32:56.441 --> 32:57.808
so it's gonna be a while.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.710
Well, let me know
when it's ready.

32:59.711 --> 33:02.509
Actually, can I ask you a favor?

33:02.580 --> 33:04.815
- Sure.
- I don't know if you've noticed.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.717
But I'm not that smooth
around the ladies.

33:07.785 --> 33:10.153
In fact, I'm a little awkward.
Let's face it.

33:10.154 --> 33:12.748
I mean, you got the looks,
I got the brains.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.793
I wanted to propose to Carrie,
so I came up with an idea,

33:15.860 --> 33:18.360
and I was hoping you
could give me some feedback.

33:18.363 --> 33:20.130
I've got the looks,
you got the brains?

33:20.131 --> 33:21.932
Tell me what you think,
and be brutal.

33:21.933 --> 33:23.266
Just be honest.

33:23.267 --> 33:26.395
Don't hold back or anything.

33:26.471 --> 33:28.939
Okay.

33:28.940 --> 33:31.773
<i># You're the micro in my chip #</i>

33:31.843 --> 33:34.368
<i># The giga in my byte #</i>

33:34.445 --> 33:36.513
<i># I think about you, Carrie #</i>

33:36.514 --> 33:39.779
<i># Every morning, noon,
and night #</i>

33:39.851 --> 33:41.651
<i># Morning, noon, and night #</i>

33:41.652 --> 33:44.152
- That's...
- Carrie!

33:45.656 --> 33:48.156
<i># We had sushi #</i>

34:03.574 --> 34:06.407
<i># I'll protect you,
can't you see? #</i>

34:06.477 --> 34:08.976
<i># Carrie, marry me #</i>

34:09.847 --> 34:11.982
I love you.

34:11.983 --> 34:14.483
I love you.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.094
No good?

34:25.096 --> 34:27.621
- I think she's gonna say yes.
- Really?

34:27.697 --> 34:29.366
'Cause of the rock-jam song?

34:29.367 --> 34:31.960
Maybe in spite
of the rock-jam song.

34:33.004 --> 34:34.271
All right.

34:34.272 --> 34:37.206
All right.
Oh, hey, your thing's ready.

34:41.344 --> 34:42.946
Thanks, Marshall.

34:42.947 --> 34:45.447
Rock 'n' roll!

34:52.389 --> 34:54.458
Sloane put Allison on the ground
20 minutes ago.

34:54.458 --> 34:56.693
We have a visual.

34:56.694 --> 34:59.194
There she is.

34:59.464 --> 35:00.697
What is that place?

35:00.698 --> 35:02.566
It looks abandoned,
like an old hotel.

35:02.567 --> 35:04.734
- Do you have an address?
- Yeah.

35:04.735 --> 35:06.970
14205 Beckerman.

35:06.971 --> 35:09.139
I'll tell the pilot.

35:09.140 --> 35:11.141
Put us down
near 14205 Beckerman.

35:11.142 --> 35:12.909
Roger that.

35:12.910 --> 35:14.811
What kind of range
does this have?

35:14.812 --> 35:16.580
Marshall said
it should track the signal

35:16.581 --> 35:18.081
Allison's using for 50 yards,

35:18.082 --> 35:21.518
but he also said it could be
set off by microwave ovens.

35:21.586 --> 35:23.153
- That's great.
- Yeah.

35:36.834 --> 35:38.602
Do you have a signal?

35:38.603 --> 35:41.936
Allison's in there, or someone's
making microwave popcorn.

35:47.445 --> 35:49.945
Let's go.

36:12.403 --> 36:13.470
Where is she?

36:13.471 --> 36:15.971
Hold on.
Upstairs.

36:23.481 --> 36:25.981
She's 30 feet down on the left.

36:42.667 --> 36:44.768
We can't track her
without the chip.

36:55.279 --> 36:56.513
I'll go this way.

36:56.514 --> 36:59.014
Okay.

37:15.299 --> 37:18.132
- She's in the west stairwell.
- Copy.

37:37.321 --> 37:39.222
Well, this is familiar,
isn't it?

37:39.223 --> 37:40.890
I was thinking
about this last night.

37:40.891 --> 37:42.726
I couldn't sleep.

37:42.727 --> 37:45.594
If I follow my orders,
if I don't kill you,

37:45.663 --> 37:47.931
you're gonna kill me.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.566
Sorry about Francie.

37:49.567 --> 37:52.067
I was just following orders.

37:52.336 --> 37:54.804
Once I'd been doubled,
I had to take her place.

37:54.805 --> 37:57.740
We did, like, 80 dinners.
We're a huge success.

38:00.678 --> 38:01.911
Hello?

38:01.912 --> 38:05.279
Mom, I'm gonna have to put you
on hold for a second, okay?

38:06.917 --> 38:08.218
Oh, my...

38:08.219 --> 38:10.719
Move into the kitchen.

38:11.789 --> 38:14.289
- You're me.
- I am now.

38:28.239 --> 38:30.739
Mom, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

38:31.242 --> 38:32.409
I had nothing against her.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.778
She just was a casualty
of circumstance.

38:34.779 --> 38:37.612
Don't blame yourself. There's
no way you could have known.

38:37.682 --> 38:39.849
Just like when you recovered
Rambaldi's journal.

38:39.850 --> 38:41.751
You had no idea
it contained a formula.

38:41.752 --> 38:43.853
What are you talking about?

38:43.854 --> 38:46.846
A formula for a medication
that would ultimately be used

38:46.924 --> 38:49.125
to help heal my wounds.

38:49.126 --> 38:54.462
So, yeah, you almost killed me,
but then you also saved my life.

40:01.832 --> 40:04.801
I shot her,
and we got the device.

40:05.836 --> 40:09.135
I know what you wanted,
but she had a pulse.

40:11.008 --> 40:12.108
Where is she now?

40:12.109 --> 40:14.634
They've taken her to a hospital.

40:15.112 --> 40:17.347
Civilian ambulance?

40:17.348 --> 40:20.476
Yeah, with an armed guard.
Why?

40:24.188 --> 40:26.523
I'll call about
getting her extradited.

40:26.524 --> 40:28.725
I want an update on her
condition as soon as you get it.

40:28.726 --> 40:30.293
Okay.

40:30.294 --> 40:32.462
Good work, Syd.

40:32.463 --> 40:34.963
Thank you.

40:56.887 --> 40:58.354
The Rambaldi book.

40:58.355 --> 41:01.222
Do you remember a formula
for a medication?

41:01.258 --> 41:03.758
No.

41:04.762 --> 41:07.262
We've got to find
that ambulance.

41:12.002 --> 41:14.337
You sure this is the route
they would take?

41:14.338 --> 41:16.105
This is the only way
to the hospital.

41:16.106 --> 41:18.606
There is no other.

41:50.307 --> 41:51.474
Wait, this makes no sense.

41:51.475 --> 41:54.410
If Allison had backup,
they would've been at the hotel.

41:54.478 --> 41:56.978
I don't think she needed backup.

41:57.047 --> 41:59.547
What do you mean?

42:01.151 --> 42:02.986
I think she did this herself.

42:02.987 --> 42:04.988
The paramedics said
she barely had a pulse.

42:04.989 --> 42:06.823
I know.

42:06.824 --> 42:09.324
She did this, Vaughn.

42:12.329 --> 42:14.829
She did this.
