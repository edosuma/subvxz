WEBVTT

00:01.679 --> 00:04.480
I give my entire interest
in the real property

00:04.519 --> 00:07.599
which was my residence
at the time of my death...

00:08.720 --> 00:11.679
..to my son, William Thomas Davenport.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.240
I direct that all my debts
and obligations

00:14.279 --> 00:16.000
be paid as soon as practical.

00:16.039 --> 00:20.199
Any contractual debts are to
be assumed by the recipient.

00:20.239 --> 00:23.160
I give, devise, and bequeath

00:23.199 --> 00:26.440
all of the residue and
remainder of my estate

00:26.480 --> 00:29.199
to my son, William Thomas Davenport.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.560
Good night, ladies. Thank you
for all your hard work today.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.079
First, you'll have to go
through the household accounts.

00:54.119 --> 00:56.479
And then there's the tax office.
His pension.

00:56.479 --> 00:57.719
His doctor and dentist. Mum...

00:57.759 --> 01:00.200
Silly little things like the
car and the passport office.

01:00.240 --> 01:01.799
Of course, everything's in his name.

01:01.840 --> 01:03.359
Mum, not now.

01:04.718 --> 01:06.079
I don't like it either, darling,

01:06.120 --> 01:08.680
but you have responsibilities
now you're the man of the house.

01:08.719 --> 01:10.680
I have responsibilities in Grantchester, too.

01:10.719 --> 01:12.760
I'm sure the parish will survive without you.

01:12.799 --> 01:15.079
I'm their priest. They need me.

01:15.079 --> 01:17.239
And I'm your mother.

01:17.239 --> 01:20.439
I know. And I want to support you.
It's just...

01:22.120 --> 01:24.959
I've never been anything but
tolerant of your religious conceits.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.319
It's not a conceit, Mum. It's my calling.

01:27.359 --> 01:29.359
When your father said
you were wasting your life,

01:29.400 --> 01:30.959
I always defended you.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.719
Hey

02:15.759 --> 02:18.520
He's just messing around.
Get off me, mate.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.479
Steady

02:25.240 --> 02:27.560
Get in.

02:27.599 --> 02:29.080
Where are you taking him?

02:48.599 --> 02:50.719
Leonard, there's someone to see you.

02:52.560 --> 02:54.520
I'll get us some tea, shall I?

02:57.520 --> 02:59.039
You can give me your best right hook.

02:59.080 --> 03:01.080
I'll keep my hands behind my back.

03:03.759 --> 03:04.960
I'm sorry.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.599
I really am so very sorry.

03:09.479 --> 03:11.680
I didn't deserve your forgiveness.

03:11.719 --> 03:13.800
Why don't you come back, Leonard?

03:13.840 --> 03:15.800
I don't think so.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.280
I don't think that would be wise.

03:17.319 --> 03:19.759
It's your home.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.080
No.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.280
No, it hasn't been that for some time.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.319
Is there nothing I can say?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.280
I'm sorry about your father.

03:33.319 --> 03:35.840
I do hope you'll accept my condolences.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.120
But all my friends are going.

03:50.159 --> 03:52.520
I don't give a damn if
your friends are going.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.400
Don't talk to her like that.

03:54.439 --> 03:57.919
How about if we dropped
her off and picked her up?

03:57.960 --> 03:59.360
She's too young.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.280
They sneak booze into those places.

04:02.879 --> 04:04.520
You know who else goes to them?

04:04.560 --> 04:05.560
Teddy Boys. That's who.

04:05.599 --> 04:07.120
I'll not have you mixing with that lot.

04:07.159 --> 04:08.280
They're not all bad.

04:08.319 --> 04:10.360
What on earth makes you say that?

04:10.400 --> 04:12.919
Geordie.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.919
Hello, Will. Say hello, Esme.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.199
Hello, Mr Davenport.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.680
Sorry for the chaos. I'm late for work.

04:19.720 --> 04:22.079
And we were just about to leave.

04:22.120 --> 04:25.160
Hey, if Mr Hobbs has a problem
with you being a few minutes later,

04:25.199 --> 04:28.279
I'd be more than happy to have
a quiet word with him, Cathy.

04:28.319 --> 04:30.319
I'll be waiting in the car.

04:32.399 --> 04:34.839
One minute's peace. Is
that too much to ask?

04:39.600 --> 04:41.839
Yep.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.839
Yeah, all right. I'll be right there.

04:55.199 --> 04:57.199
Get to school. You're late.

04:57.240 --> 05:00.160
And don't you dare roll
your eyes at me, young lady.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.879
Sorry.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.279
A tough morning.

05:10.439 --> 05:11.720
How was the funeral?

05:11.759 --> 05:14.160
Maybe we can get a pint later?

05:14.199 --> 05:17.240
Is everything all right with you and...?
- No.

05:19.879 --> 05:23.720
That was Larry. They found
a body behind the dance hall.

05:23.759 --> 05:25.600
Come with me.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.319
Do you want to tell her
she's getting the bus?

05:42.199 --> 05:44.160
Wouldn't you just know it?

05:47.639 --> 05:49.800
Panto season already, boys?

05:49.839 --> 05:53.040
Who does that make you,
one of the ugly sisters?

05:54.680 --> 05:56.319
This is Stanley Milton and Eric Brown.

05:56.360 --> 05:57.399
They found the body.

05:57.439 --> 05:59.959
Shouldn't you be at school?
What are you, my dad?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.839
Will you show some respect,
you little sod?

06:04.639 --> 06:06.319
Get up. Hey, get off me

06:06.360 --> 06:07.720
You think you're clever, do you?

06:07.759 --> 06:09.319
You apologise.

06:09.360 --> 06:12.759
Guv, these two are the
ones who called the police.

06:14.399 --> 06:16.560
Right, that's it. Larry.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.560
You can't arrest us.
We were trying to help.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.160
Oi Please, we ain't done nothing.

06:21.199 --> 06:22.639
Are you sure about this, Geordie?

06:22.680 --> 06:24.560
Ah, stick them in the cells for a bit.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.439
See how clever you feel then, Dandini.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.839
Come on then.

06:28.879 --> 06:30.879
We didn't do nothing.

06:36.759 --> 06:38.519
Morning, Claire. Morning, Cathy.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.959
Anyway, I'll have to see you later.

06:50.079 --> 06:51.639
You all right, Cath?

06:51.680 --> 06:53.680
Oh, I'm fine, thanks.

06:55.879 --> 06:57.839
Those kids were barely
old enough to be shaving.

06:57.879 --> 06:59.240
Don't let them fool you.

06:59.279 --> 07:00.839
They would have a knife at your throat

07:00.879 --> 07:03.240
quicker than you could
say juvenile delinquent.

07:03.240 --> 07:05.800
The sooner they're
brought into line, the better.

07:05.839 --> 07:07.720
What did I tell you?

07:08.720 --> 07:11.199
Trouble finds this lot
like flies find shite.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.879
Get me whoever's in
charge of the building. Guv.

07:19.399 --> 07:20.920
He'd been drinking.

07:20.959 --> 07:23.000
What makes you say that?

07:24.360 --> 07:26.319
Boozing, fighting.

07:26.360 --> 07:28.360
Have they got nothing better to do?

07:28.399 --> 07:29.600
They're kids.

07:29.639 --> 07:31.639
Of course they don't.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.079
What we need?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.720
Is a good war.

07:34.759 --> 07:36.680
That would stop this nonsense sharpish.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.879
You're right, Geordie.
What this generation needs

07:38.920 --> 07:40.720
is to be shot at on a regular basis

07:44.040 --> 07:45.920
He was a pupil at Riverside School.

07:49.279 --> 07:51.399
Donald Clarke.

07:56.079 --> 07:57.279
What is it?

08:04.420 --> 08:06.179
Just try and stay calm.

08:06.220 --> 08:07.619
It's not easy to stay calm

08:07.660 --> 08:10.540
when there's a photograph of my
daughter in a dead boy's wallet.

08:10.579 --> 08:13.100
Let's not jump to
conclusions is all I'm saying.

08:17.660 --> 08:19.220
Ugh.

08:19.259 --> 08:21.939
What is that? Bleach?

08:21.980 --> 08:24.139
Believe me, it's better
than the smell of vomit.

08:24.179 --> 08:26.300
Cecil forgot to lock the storeroom
last night.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.939
Someone threw up in here.

08:27.979 --> 08:29.979
How do I know what's so funny?

08:30.020 --> 08:32.780
I'm the poor fool got to clean it up.

08:32.818 --> 08:35.339
Could you just tell me if you
recognise this boy, please, sir?

08:38.380 --> 08:41.140
Got himself into a heck of a fight,
that one.

08:41.179 --> 08:42.380
Do you know what it was about?

08:42.419 --> 08:44.179
Bit of skirt, probably.

08:44.219 --> 08:46.059
Always is.

08:46.099 --> 08:48.420
I didn't get a proper look
at the other one.

08:48.459 --> 08:50.500
But they're all the same.

08:50.540 --> 08:51.900
Rude and nasty.

08:51.939 --> 08:53.459
All the same.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.939
Teddy Boys.

08:54.979 --> 08:56.140
They were both Teds.

09:10.500 --> 09:13.459
I knew he liked me, but
there was nothing going on.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.459
"They're not all bad."

09:15.500 --> 09:16.579
That's what you said.

09:16.620 --> 09:18.099
I wasn't talking about him.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.260
Are you lying to me, Esme?

09:23.300 --> 09:25.179
No

09:25.219 --> 09:28.179
He was two years above
me. I promise you, Dad

09:31.099 --> 09:32.660
Oh, come here.

09:36.300 --> 09:38.179
You won't tell Mum, will you?

09:38.219 --> 09:40.500
Not if you don't want me to.

09:44.339 --> 09:45.459
Look at you.

09:45.500 --> 09:48.699
Let me sort this out.

09:48.740 --> 09:50.339
Right.

09:50.380 --> 09:51.420
Point us in the direction

09:51.459 --> 09:53.380
of Donald Clarke's form teacher,
would you?

09:54.459 --> 09:58.699
Donnie was a boy with lots
of problems, I'm sorry to say.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.140
Such as?

10:00.179 --> 10:03.059
Well, for one thing, drink.

10:03.099 --> 10:07.099
I offered guidance, but Donnie
struggled with authority.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.459
Such a troubled boy.

10:08.500 --> 10:12.260
Might it have been suicide?

10:14.660 --> 10:16.939
Well, Donnie was seen in a
fight with another Teddy Boy

10:16.979 --> 10:18.339
shortly before he died.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.660
Did he have any enemies?

10:20.660 --> 10:22.819
Not that I'm aware of, but...

10:23.979 --> 10:25.740
Well, you know what they're like,
Teds.

10:25.780 --> 10:26.780
Animals.

10:26.819 --> 10:28.219
Excuse me.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.260
Fight! Fight!

10:42.979 --> 10:45.099
Fight

10:54.260 --> 10:55.780
Inside.

10:55.819 --> 10:57.020
Yes, sir.

10:57.059 --> 10:58.579
I'll see you after school.

10:58.620 --> 11:00.620
Come here. Let me see, Kevin.

11:02.380 --> 11:04.579
Go and see the nurse.
- Yes, sir. Straight away.

11:04.579 --> 11:06.780
Such behaviour will never be tolerated.

11:06.819 --> 11:09.140
Your parents will be notified.

11:12.579 --> 11:14.140
It'll cheer you up.

11:14.179 --> 11:17.219
Besides, it's nothing less than you deserve.

11:18.579 --> 11:21.260
I'll, er... I'll see you back at home.

11:21.300 --> 11:23.300
I'm not sure what to get, Jack.

11:23.339 --> 11:26.140
I've already got a perfectly
adequate wardrobe.

11:26.179 --> 11:27.939
Well, treat yourself.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.740
And if you like more than one outfit,

11:30.780 --> 11:32.099
well, then, buy more than one.

11:32.140 --> 11:33.620
It will be my pleasure.

11:41.540 --> 11:43.339
Sylvia.

11:43.380 --> 11:45.099
I thought it was you.

11:45.140 --> 11:46.620
Oh, Cathy. Thank goodness.

11:46.660 --> 11:48.140
Oh, is everything all right?

11:48.179 --> 11:49.699
It is not all right.

11:49.740 --> 11:52.979
Jack seems to think spending
his money will cheer me up.

11:53.020 --> 11:56.140
Sometimes I don't think he knows me at all.

11:56.179 --> 11:59.300
With my class, discipline is key.

11:59.339 --> 12:03.059
I don't stand for any nonsense,
and they respect me for it.

12:03.099 --> 12:05.540
If you can make the pupils
feel they're part of one unit,

12:05.579 --> 12:06.900
you're halfway there.

12:06.939 --> 12:08.819
You can't have order without respect.

12:08.859 --> 12:11.699
Precisely. Precisely.
But it's a two-way street.

12:11.740 --> 12:14.219
You know, I'd run through
a wall for those children,

12:14.260 --> 12:15.780
and they'd do the same for me.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.699
And they all look out for each other.

12:17.740 --> 12:19.579
Strength through discipline.

12:19.620 --> 12:21.939
Well, can I just say,
you're doing a great job.

12:21.979 --> 12:23.979
Chalk and cheese compared
to my daughter's lot.

12:24.020 --> 12:25.140
Well, thank you.

12:25.179 --> 12:26.500
If you want to wait in here,

12:26.540 --> 12:28.660
I'll send in some of Donnie's classmates.

12:30.179 --> 12:31.979
Stop doing this, please.

12:32.020 --> 12:33.660
Just relax.

12:39.179 --> 12:41.020
Next time, knock.

12:44.020 --> 12:45.780
Are you all right, Hazel, love?

12:45.819 --> 12:47.699
I'm fine.

12:47.740 --> 12:50.020
Going out for a ciggie.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.260
I know this must be hard.

12:55.300 --> 12:56.740
Were any of you friends with him?

12:56.780 --> 12:58.620
He didn't have friends. Not really.

12:58.660 --> 13:00.780
It's the truth.

13:00.819 --> 13:02.579
Right, Kevin?

13:03.780 --> 13:05.540
No-one really knew him that well.

13:05.579 --> 13:07.099
Not even the other Teds.

13:07.140 --> 13:08.780
He'd only been one for a while.

13:08.819 --> 13:10.300
Do you know why he joined them?

13:11.819 --> 13:13.459
Were any of you at the dance?

13:13.500 --> 13:15.579
No.

13:15.620 --> 13:18.699
Well, if you think of anything
that could help the enquiry,

13:18.740 --> 13:21.260
please, ask Mr Pope to contact me.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.420
Yes, sir.

13:26.540 --> 13:28.900
Right, well, thanks for your help.

13:28.939 --> 13:30.459
Of course, sir.

13:31.459 --> 13:33.420
How much do you reckon
I'd have to bribe Mr Pope

13:33.459 --> 13:34.939
to take Esme into his class?

13:34.979 --> 13:38.219
If you told him to walk across the
Cam, you know he'd sink, right?

13:38.260 --> 13:40.859
I don't know. I'd like to see him
give it a go

13:43.500 --> 13:46.020
Do you think there's anything
in his idea that it was suicide?

13:47.459 --> 13:49.660
We'll have to see what
the post-mortem reveals.

13:51.339 --> 13:53.620
Are you sure this isn't too much for you?

14:08.020 --> 14:10.500
When did everything get so flouncy?

14:10.540 --> 14:12.500
What's wrong with a sturdy tweed?

14:14.900 --> 14:16.300
What is it?

14:32.660 --> 14:33.740
Leonard.

14:34.939 --> 14:36.900
If you'd rather I left... No

14:38.459 --> 14:40.020
No, please.

14:49.660 --> 14:51.859
I used to pray all the time.

14:51.900 --> 14:53.900
Say thank you to God.

14:55.620 --> 14:57.859
Show gratitude for my day.

14:57.900 --> 15:00.780
But I can't find it in myself
to be grateful any more.

15:00.819 --> 15:02.900
God can't solve all our problems.

15:02.939 --> 15:03.979
I know.

15:04.020 --> 15:08.380
And my problem isn't
something one can solve.

15:08.420 --> 15:10.979
Your love for Daniel?

15:12.979 --> 15:14.780
I know what you are, Leonard.

15:14.819 --> 15:17.099
And I don't care.

15:17.099 --> 15:18.219
And God doesn't either.

15:18.260 --> 15:19.620
Don't, please.

15:19.660 --> 15:21.699
You haven't been struck down.

15:21.740 --> 15:24.979
Look, look, this man is a homosexual!

15:26.339 --> 15:27.859
See? Nothing.

15:27.900 --> 15:29.500
Not a dicky bird.

15:29.540 --> 15:31.380
I haven't been struck down?

15:32.859 --> 15:35.780
My whole life is punishment, Will.

15:35.819 --> 15:38.579
God loves you for who you are.

15:38.620 --> 15:40.140
Sidney told me that once.

15:42.099 --> 15:43.780
I wish it were true.

15:46.979 --> 15:48.979
Ah, I had to tell someone.

15:49.020 --> 15:50.819
Does Geordie know?

15:51.979 --> 15:54.179
And now we're not even speaking.

15:54.219 --> 15:56.300
Why don't you just leave your job?

15:56.339 --> 16:00.339
Because I'm not gonna give
that pig the satisfaction.

16:01.740 --> 16:04.819
Besides, I like having my own salary.

16:04.859 --> 16:06.500
And my own friends.

16:06.540 --> 16:09.380
I'm not just Geordie's wife.

16:10.859 --> 16:13.140
I'm not sure I knew how
much that mattered until now.

16:13.179 --> 16:14.459
Of course it does.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.099
A woman's independence is a precious thing.

16:17.140 --> 16:20.699
I feel like I'm being punished
for leaving my children.

16:20.740 --> 16:22.300
What rubbish.

16:22.339 --> 16:26.020
This is Mr Hobbs' fault, and nobody else's.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.939
If you want to work, you work.

16:29.979 --> 16:32.099
And that man can bugger right off.

16:35.939 --> 16:37.459
To tell you the truth,

16:37.500 --> 16:41.260
I don't know if I wasn't happier
when I was at the vicarage.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.579
Why don't you go back?

16:46.260 --> 16:47.900
This Mr Hobbs,

16:47.939 --> 16:49.819
something needs to be done about him.

16:58.620 --> 17:01.180
I'm sorry to just show up.

17:01.220 --> 17:02.419
That's all right.

17:02.460 --> 17:05.540
Oh, this came for you.

17:08.300 --> 17:11.500
Donnie and I had been writing to each other.

17:13.339 --> 17:16.180
I couldn't tell Dad. He
would have gone berserk.

17:16.220 --> 17:18.260
I've seen it first-hand. It's not pretty.

17:21.659 --> 17:23.579
Is there something else?

17:24.780 --> 17:26.540
He went to kiss me.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.220
The day of the dance.

17:28.260 --> 17:29.619
At the bus stop.

17:29.659 --> 17:32.020
Barbara's older brother saw us.

17:34.099 --> 17:36.460
He was laughing at
Donnie, and teasing him.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.780
Donnie was so angry.

17:38.780 --> 17:40.899
Is Barbara's brother a Teddy Boy?

17:44.339 --> 17:47.579
Everyone's saying that there was a fight.

17:48.940 --> 17:51.099
What if he died because of me?

17:51.099 --> 17:52.700
Don't be silly.

17:52.740 --> 17:54.619
Of course that's not true.

17:56.020 --> 17:59.700
I know this is hard, Esme, but
you've done the right thing.

17:59.740 --> 18:02.059
Are you gonna tell Dad?

18:03.540 --> 18:04.859
There's nothing to be afraid of.

18:04.899 --> 18:06.780
I'll make sure of it.

18:07.899 --> 18:10.940
Do you know his name? The
other boy. Barbara's brother.

18:12.619 --> 18:15.020
Stanley Milton.

18:21.819 --> 18:23.339
Stanley Milton.

18:23.379 --> 18:26.700
I'm arresting you on suspicion
of the murder of Donnie Clark.

18:28.579 --> 18:30.379
Not so funny now, is it?

18:32.419 --> 18:35.300
You've got no-one else to
blame but yourself, Stanley.

18:35.339 --> 18:37.780
I didn't kill him. I swear to you.

18:37.819 --> 18:40.500
Yeah, we had a bit of a
scrap, but it was nothing.

18:40.540 --> 18:42.059
I went home early.

18:42.099 --> 18:44.780
If you thought calling the police
would make you seem less guilty,

18:44.819 --> 18:46.540
you're even thicker than I thought.

18:46.579 --> 18:50.300
Look, I swear to God I
have no idea how he died.

18:51.379 --> 18:53.659
Please, you've got to believe me.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.059
Just let me know when
you're ready to confess.

18:56.059 --> 18:59.379
In the meantime, make
yourself comfortable.

19:04.379 --> 19:06.740
It's clear he didn't do it, Geordie.

19:06.780 --> 19:08.659
And suddenly you're an expert now.

19:08.700 --> 19:11.460
No, but I know honesty when I see it.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.180
Isn't it possible that it
wasn't a murder or a suicide,

19:14.220 --> 19:15.460
but just a terrible accident.

19:15.500 --> 19:18.220
That boy in there's everything
that is wrong with this country.

19:18.260 --> 19:19.780
I understand you're upset about Esme,

19:19.819 --> 19:22.339
but to be prejudiced against
- Are you questioning my integrity?

19:22.379 --> 19:23.980
Of course not. I'm just saying...

19:24.020 --> 19:25.819
Maybe you should get
your own house in order

19:25.859 --> 19:27.780
before you start preaching to other people.

19:36.659 --> 19:38.339
Do you want my honest opinion?

19:38.379 --> 19:40.099
Of course I do.

19:40.139 --> 19:41.659
Leave the church.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.579
Become a teacher.

19:43.619 --> 19:45.339
Or a novelist.

19:45.379 --> 19:46.899
I don't know. Anything.

19:46.940 --> 19:50.059
The church is... It's who I am.

19:50.099 --> 19:51.740
It's what makes you miserable.

19:52.740 --> 19:54.940
Our lives are difficult
enough as they are, Leonard.

19:54.980 --> 19:57.220
You've never understood what I do.

19:59.379 --> 20:01.379
You work for an institution that reviles you,

20:01.419 --> 20:02.899
so no, I've never understood.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.059
I mean, sometimes...
- What?

20:04.099 --> 20:06.059
No.
- No, go on

20:07.379 --> 20:09.260
Sometimes it feels like self-flagellation.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.659
It's almost like you enjoy the pain.

20:11.700 --> 20:14.540
Maybe I'd have been
better off marrying Hilary.

20:14.579 --> 20:17.180
Have my own parish. Have
some semblance of normality.

20:17.220 --> 20:18.899
Maybe then I'd have been happy.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.260
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.659
Yes, you did.

20:40.659 --> 20:42.339
Bloody hell, Dad.

20:48.020 --> 20:50.300
I'd have sent him packing hours ago.

20:50.339 --> 20:53.740
You don't see us getting up on
his pulpit and giving sermons.

20:53.780 --> 20:56.460
You don't see us in church at all,
to be fair.

20:57.940 --> 20:59.300
Sorry to interrupt.

20:59.339 --> 21:03.139
Results of the post-mortem on Donnie Clark.

21:05.460 --> 21:07.859
This will tell you if that
little sod's been lying to you.

21:07.899 --> 21:10.819
Well, actually, guv, it says the
cause of death was asphyxia.

21:14.059 --> 21:15.859
Blood alcohol levels through the roof.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.460
He was pissed out of his mind.

21:20.099 --> 21:22.339
Choked on his own vomit.

21:34.220 --> 21:36.700
It looks like you were right about Stanley.

21:36.740 --> 21:38.740
Donnie Clarke died of asphyxia.

21:42.020 --> 21:44.139
I'm sorry if I overstepped the mark.

21:45.180 --> 21:46.700
No, you're not.

21:46.740 --> 21:49.099
You're smug, cos you were
right, and I was wrong.

21:51.260 --> 21:54.700
Eh, I interrupted your chat
with the big fella. I'm sorry.

21:54.740 --> 21:57.139
He's not being very forthcoming today, so...

21:58.819 --> 22:00.379
How is everything?

22:01.740 --> 22:03.700
So much worse than I thought, Geordie.

22:03.740 --> 22:06.700
There's no way to pay off the debt.

22:07.819 --> 22:09.619
Mum wants me to leave my job.

22:09.659 --> 22:11.540
Go back home.

22:11.579 --> 22:13.300
Let me ask you a question.

22:13.339 --> 22:14.700
If there was money...

22:14.740 --> 22:16.859
Would you go back?

22:16.899 --> 22:18.940
Would you give all this up?

22:21.460 --> 22:22.700
You and I...

22:22.740 --> 22:26.619
We have, er... a calling.

22:28.780 --> 22:32.220
And sometimes our families have
to bear the brunt, unfortunately.

22:37.020 --> 22:38.579
Geordie, what is it?

22:38.619 --> 22:40.659
You can tell me.

22:45.059 --> 22:46.819
He tried it on with her.

22:46.859 --> 22:48.139
Hobbs.

22:49.980 --> 22:52.780
And now I just feel like
I'm angry all the time.

22:52.819 --> 22:55.139
I can't relate to that in any way

22:55.180 --> 22:56.899
How can Cathy expect me to carry on

22:56.940 --> 22:59.700
knowing that every time
she goes to work, he's there.

22:59.740 --> 23:01.819
She told you to stay out of it?

23:01.859 --> 23:05.339
I'm sorry, Geordie. It must be difficult.

23:06.940 --> 23:10.700
So, Donnie Clarke's death
was an accident, then?

23:12.059 --> 23:14.780
What, he got too drunk and
passed out in that old car?

23:14.819 --> 23:16.859
The report says he choked on his own vomit,

23:16.899 --> 23:18.980
but I didn't see any vomit in the car.

23:20.059 --> 23:22.220
What?

23:22.220 --> 23:24.379
Remember the smell of
bleach at the dance hall?

23:24.419 --> 23:27.540
Or, more specifically, the
storage room at the dance hall?

23:40.700 --> 23:42.659
Will.

23:47.099 --> 23:49.099
He was trying to get out.

23:52.619 --> 23:54.419
Someone locked him in.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.460
He was so drunk, he threw up,

24:20.500 --> 24:23.379
but because of the gag, he choked to death.

24:25.819 --> 24:27.780
This was the crime scene. Not the car.

24:29.700 --> 24:31.859
Someone was trying to
cover up what happened here.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.659
What is that?

24:34.700 --> 24:36.540
Stanley Milton.

24:36.579 --> 24:39.500
Stanley's just an insecure
kid trying to be a rebel.

24:39.540 --> 24:42.059
He's not capable of this.

24:45.180 --> 24:47.139
Back to the sodding drawing board.

24:48.740 --> 24:50.139
I'm sorry to burden you with this.

24:50.180 --> 24:51.899
It's not a burden. Don't worry.

24:51.940 --> 24:54.020
He's gone.

24:54.059 --> 24:56.419
We both said some things.

24:56.460 --> 24:59.339
Well, if Leonard needs time to clear his head,

24:59.379 --> 25:00.899
maybe that's best for everyone.

25:00.940 --> 25:03.780
He thinks God doesn't love him anymore.

25:03.819 --> 25:05.899
It matters a great deal to him.

25:05.940 --> 25:07.819
But I don't believe in God.

25:07.859 --> 25:09.220
You understand.

25:09.260 --> 25:10.619
You can help him.

25:11.940 --> 25:14.139
Do you know where he went?

25:28.659 --> 25:31.500
Of all the bus stops in all the world...

25:33.020 --> 25:34.740
It doesn't quite have the same ring to it.

25:36.579 --> 25:38.300
Where are you going?

25:38.339 --> 25:39.740
I don't know.

25:39.780 --> 25:44.139
It's only just struck me, I don't
really have anywhere else to go.

25:49.659 --> 25:51.579
Daniel thinks this is about God.

25:51.619 --> 25:53.859
Is he angry?

25:53.899 --> 25:55.419
He's worried.

25:55.460 --> 25:57.859
I said some awful things.

25:57.899 --> 25:59.500
Well, at least you didn't punch him.

26:01.260 --> 26:02.980
There is that, I suppose.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.899
I don't think this is about God.

26:04.940 --> 26:07.180
I think this is about Mrs C.

26:07.220 --> 26:08.379
And Sidney.

26:08.419 --> 26:09.540
You had a family.

26:09.579 --> 26:11.220
And now you don't.

26:11.260 --> 26:13.339
I miss them so much, it hurts.

26:17.059 --> 26:18.780
Sorry, this must seem awfully trivial.

26:18.819 --> 26:20.819
No. No, it doesn't.

26:20.859 --> 26:23.540
You just... buried your father.

26:25.540 --> 26:27.059
Before he died,

26:27.099 --> 26:29.379
my dad asked me if I despised him.

26:29.419 --> 26:31.300
And I said no.

26:32.819 --> 26:34.139
But I did.

26:35.300 --> 26:36.859
I despise who he was.

26:36.899 --> 26:40.099
And I despise who he made me.

26:40.139 --> 26:42.500
There's too much of him in me.

26:43.940 --> 26:46.659
I'm sorry. I'm not... Making excuses.

26:46.700 --> 26:48.260
I know.

26:48.300 --> 26:52.780
I suspect your father and
mine might have got on.

26:52.819 --> 26:55.780
They sound like they have a lot in common.

26:55.819 --> 26:58.139
Come home, Leonard.

26:58.180 --> 27:00.419
Please.

27:00.460 --> 27:02.540
Things can't carry on as they were.

27:02.579 --> 27:04.859
Maybe not.

27:04.859 --> 27:07.460
They don't have to change entirely either.

27:09.379 --> 27:10.980
Come on.

27:28.020 --> 27:29.899
Leonard?

27:33.099 --> 27:34.700
Old scars.

27:47.659 --> 27:49.659
There's a scar on Wendy's arm.

27:49.700 --> 27:52.540
I'm sure I saw the same
symbol in the storeroom.

28:01.300 --> 28:03.300
You're lucky that hasn't gone septic.

28:03.339 --> 28:05.819
Please. Not here.

28:05.859 --> 28:08.379
Somewhere private.

28:08.419 --> 28:10.339
What does it mean?

28:10.379 --> 28:11.859
The Fourth Realm.

28:11.899 --> 28:14.460
It's a kind of underground group.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.059
Of students?

28:16.099 --> 28:17.740
I'm not telling you any more.

28:17.780 --> 28:20.139
That's not the way this works, I'm afraid.

28:20.180 --> 28:21.379
They'll hurt me.

28:21.419 --> 28:22.899
Who's "they", Wendy?

28:22.940 --> 28:24.899
Did they kill Donnie Clarke?

28:24.940 --> 28:25.940
I don't know who did it.

28:25.980 --> 28:28.780
All I know is that it wasn't
the boy you arrested.

28:28.819 --> 28:30.220
Maybe I should arrest you instead?

28:30.260 --> 28:33.180
Look, I don't want to be a
part of it any more. I hate it.

28:33.220 --> 28:35.220
Why don't you speak to the others?

28:35.260 --> 28:36.980
They all went to the dance.

28:37.020 --> 28:39.659
They lied to you.

28:39.700 --> 28:41.540
Why?

28:41.579 --> 28:42.819
Because they were told to.

28:42.859 --> 28:44.780
Why do you think?

28:45.899 --> 28:47.579
Are you all right, Wendy?

28:49.180 --> 28:51.139
Geordie, Geordie...

28:51.180 --> 28:53.180
Tell me about the Fourth Realm.

28:53.220 --> 28:54.339
I don't know what you mean.

28:54.379 --> 28:57.220
You're fooling no one, you little bastard.

28:57.260 --> 28:59.059
I know it was your lot who killed him.

28:59.099 --> 29:00.619
Come on, Raymond.

29:00.659 --> 29:02.899
Kevin Moran.

29:04.859 --> 29:07.020
It was Kevin Moran.

29:22.980 --> 29:24.940
Hello, Kevin.

29:32.780 --> 29:34.579
Unusual hobby, son.

29:36.859 --> 29:38.460
It can be hard sometimes.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.500
That need to belong.

29:42.419 --> 29:44.300
Was the Fourth Realm
the first time in your life

29:44.339 --> 29:46.300
that you truly felt part of something?

29:46.339 --> 29:48.579
Part of a family.

29:48.619 --> 29:50.899
Tell me about the knives, Kevin.

29:50.899 --> 29:53.940
You've got to protect your own, haven't you?

29:55.500 --> 29:57.260
I didn't want to see them hurt.

29:57.300 --> 29:59.460
Look, Kevin. All right.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.940
This is bollocks.

30:01.980 --> 30:03.819
We know you killed him, Kevin.

30:03.859 --> 30:06.659
All your so-called mates snitched on you.

30:06.700 --> 30:09.059
And do you think being young will save you?

30:09.059 --> 30:11.300
Then you've never heard
about little Michael Hamilton

30:11.339 --> 30:13.460
and his 11-year-old sister Anne.

30:13.500 --> 30:15.540
Because not so long ago in Kings Lynn,

30:15.579 --> 30:17.700
they were both found guilty and hanged.

30:18.819 --> 30:20.980
And guess what their crime was.

30:20.980 --> 30:22.180
Stealing a loaf of bread.

30:22.220 --> 30:24.139
He was gonna squeal

30:24.180 --> 30:27.260
So I locked him in the
supply cupboard to scare him.

30:27.300 --> 30:30.099
It was only half an hour.

30:31.859 --> 30:34.540
I never thought he could die.

30:34.579 --> 30:36.579
He was going to leave the group, wasn't he?

30:36.619 --> 30:38.980
Is that why you painted the
symbol in the storeroom?

30:38.980 --> 30:41.180
To make him think about his loyalties.

30:42.180 --> 30:44.780
Now, how did you get him to the car?

30:44.819 --> 30:47.339
I... I just dragged him.

30:48.460 --> 30:50.099
Don't you lie to me, boy

30:50.139 --> 30:51.780
I'm not. I did it

30:51.819 --> 30:54.379
I did it. On my own.

30:56.540 --> 30:57.740
I'm sorry.

30:57.780 --> 30:59.780
Please.

31:00.940 --> 31:03.059
It really was an accident.

31:09.059 --> 31:11.180
Child executions?

31:12.619 --> 31:14.139
Don't you look at me like that.

31:14.180 --> 31:17.460
I just got justice for Donnie Clarke's family.

31:17.500 --> 31:20.220
How many centuries ago was it?
Were they still dunking witches?

31:20.260 --> 31:21.379
Have you got a confession?

31:21.419 --> 31:22.859
Yeah, great work.

31:22.899 --> 31:25.500
This is your calling, then, is it?

31:25.540 --> 31:29.180
And you think it's justified,
frightening kids into submission?

31:29.220 --> 31:31.220
If the force was full of
bleeding hearts like you,

31:31.260 --> 31:33.099
the streets would be teeming with criminals.

31:33.139 --> 31:35.780
I reckon this is cause for a celebration.

31:35.819 --> 31:37.260
Come on. I'm buying.

31:37.300 --> 31:39.540
Geordie, you are better than this.

31:39.579 --> 31:41.180
Kids are killing each other, Will.

31:42.460 --> 31:44.099
If we don't stamp it out, what next?

31:44.139 --> 31:46.260
That is not what this is
about, and you know it.

32:03.339 --> 32:05.059
That's quite the hat.

32:05.099 --> 32:07.099
She's quite the woman.

32:07.139 --> 32:09.139
Wealthiest in Cambridge.

32:09.180 --> 32:11.859
Good afternoon, madam.

32:11.899 --> 32:14.540
Is there anything I can help you with today?

32:14.579 --> 32:17.819
Yes. My husband Jack
Chapman has an account here.

32:17.859 --> 32:19.859
Then may I say, Mrs Chapman,

32:19.899 --> 32:23.579
that your husband's fine taste
extends well beyond fashion.

32:25.020 --> 32:27.579
We plan to redecorate
our home. Top to bottom.

32:27.619 --> 32:29.859
And I need some new outfits.

32:29.899 --> 32:31.740
Not to put too fine a point on it,

32:31.780 --> 32:34.700
but we shall be spending an
unwholesome amount of money.

32:34.740 --> 32:35.980
Please.

32:45.419 --> 32:47.740
Shut up

32:47.780 --> 32:50.700
Stand against the wall. All of you.

32:50.740 --> 32:53.379
Come on. Move it.

32:54.379 --> 32:56.300
Take your hat off.

32:56.339 --> 32:58.579
Did you learn nothing at school?

33:01.460 --> 33:03.659
And Churchill said, well,
I'll have two of them.

33:05.659 --> 33:06.940
Geordie.

33:12.899 --> 33:15.500
When Wendy admitted the
others went to the dance after all,

33:15.540 --> 33:18.139
she said, "they lied to
you. They were told to."

33:18.180 --> 33:19.419
Who told them to?

33:19.460 --> 33:21.819
Look, what does it matter? Kevin confessed.

33:21.819 --> 33:24.859
Remember that teacher who said
Donnie struggled with authority?

33:24.899 --> 33:27.540
What if this is about obedience?

33:27.579 --> 33:30.980
How we blindly do what
authority figures tell us to.

33:31.020 --> 33:34.300
Do you seriously believe Kevin
Moran acted of his own volition?

33:34.339 --> 33:37.139
It's their leader we should be going for.

33:37.180 --> 33:39.139
Mr Pope.

33:39.180 --> 33:41.220
He says jump, they say how high.

33:47.780 --> 33:50.540
I hope we're not interrupting
your marking, Mr Pope.

33:56.979 --> 33:58.660
Excuse me.

33:58.700 --> 34:00.660
Excuse me

34:00.700 --> 34:02.700
What are you doing?

34:15.458 --> 34:17.179
The Fourth Realm.

34:17.219 --> 34:21.339
I started that group to improve their marks.

34:21.379 --> 34:23.179
Rewards for compliance.

34:23.219 --> 34:25.498
Penalties for disobedience.

34:25.498 --> 34:26.699
They embraced it.

34:26.739 --> 34:29.139
It gave them purpose. Unity.

34:29.179 --> 34:30.659
And then the wheels came off.

34:30.699 --> 34:33.219
Donnie Clarke.

34:33.260 --> 34:35.539
You can't blame me for that.

34:35.580 --> 34:37.018
He was going to blow the whistle.

34:37.060 --> 34:38.978
Defected, did he?

34:39.018 --> 34:40.899
He thought the Teds would be more fun.

34:40.938 --> 34:43.859
And so you told your acolytes to intervene.

34:43.899 --> 34:45.379
Teach him a lesson.

34:45.418 --> 34:46.780
The boy died.

34:46.819 --> 34:48.219
You've blood on your hands.

34:48.260 --> 34:51.018
Um... What are you
going to charge me with?

34:51.060 --> 34:53.139
I wasn't even at the dance hall that night.

34:53.179 --> 34:55.458
Wendy's your daughter.

34:55.458 --> 34:56.458
Yes.

34:56.498 --> 34:57.780
She didn't fall for it, did she?

34:57.819 --> 35:01.419
She saw through your poor man's
Hitler Youth and turned against it.

35:01.459 --> 35:02.819
Where is she, Mr Pope?

35:07.019 --> 35:08.620
Wendy! Where are you going?

35:08.660 --> 35:10.700
Wendy! You can't just...

35:18.060 --> 35:19.419
Bloody hell.

35:19.459 --> 35:22.260
You don't understand.

35:22.300 --> 35:25.180
A couple of years ago,
she was going off the rails.

35:25.220 --> 35:28.300
What kind of father are you?
It worked. She was improving.

35:28.339 --> 35:29.499
I was afraid of losing her.

35:44.140 --> 35:45.780
Stand back, Wendy!

35:49.539 --> 35:50.819
It's all right. It's all right.

35:54.100 --> 35:55.740
I did it for her own good.

35:55.780 --> 35:57.379
You would have done the same.

36:06.260 --> 36:08.939
This one would suit me, don't you think?

36:08.979 --> 36:10.899
What about this one?

36:10.939 --> 36:12.539
I think this would be perfect for you.

36:12.580 --> 36:14.819
Hang the expense.

36:14.859 --> 36:16.660
I'll take all three.

36:16.700 --> 36:19.660
Oh, we'll have to
continue this later, Anthony.

36:19.700 --> 36:21.180
I'm late for Mr Draper.

36:22.220 --> 36:24.499
I shall mention you to him.

36:27.339 --> 36:30.019
I'm delighted you've
chosen us, Mrs Chapman.

36:30.060 --> 36:34.700
And I'd like to thank you
for your continued loyalty.

36:34.740 --> 36:37.660
Ah, but that's just the thing, Mr Draper.

36:37.700 --> 36:39.379
There's a condition to it.

36:39.419 --> 36:43.580
And it's absolutely non-negotiable.

36:48.180 --> 36:51.100
That poor girl.

36:55.539 --> 36:57.819
He did it out of love, he said.

36:57.859 --> 37:00.260
Not the kind of love I recognise.

37:02.419 --> 37:04.899
Then again, if the force was
full of bleeding hearts like me,

37:04.939 --> 37:06.899
the streets would be teeming with criminals

37:18.379 --> 37:20.180
This was your doing, wasn't it.

37:20.220 --> 37:23.220
You play with fire, you get burned.

37:23.260 --> 37:26.740
Do you know what Draper would
say if I told him about our night out?

37:26.780 --> 37:28.580
You giggling over your Tom Collins.

37:28.620 --> 37:30.220
He'd say you were a slut.

37:31.620 --> 37:33.979
Go on then. Tell him.

37:34.019 --> 37:36.339
If you're so sure that's what he'd say.

37:38.260 --> 37:40.979
Let's tell him about Hazel, too, shall we?

37:41.019 --> 37:44.899
This is your fault, and
no-one else's, Mr Hobbs.

37:49.979 --> 37:52.979
I rather enjoyed that.

37:53.019 --> 37:54.899
Oh, don't be daft now.

38:07.620 --> 38:09.459
I'm so glad you came, darling.

38:11.100 --> 38:12.539
We're going to get through this.

38:12.580 --> 38:15.459
You and I.

38:15.499 --> 38:18.100
We're going to move on.

38:18.140 --> 38:22.140
The only way that we can move
on is by selling the estate, Mum.

38:22.180 --> 38:24.939
And I know it's not what
you want to hear, but -

38:24.979 --> 38:26.220
It's my home.

38:26.260 --> 38:29.580
There's not enough
income to pay off the debts.

38:29.620 --> 38:30.979
We're gonna lose it either way.

38:31.019 --> 38:32.939
He left you the estate

38:32.979 --> 38:36.939
because he wanted you to
preserve your lineage. Not destroy it.

38:36.979 --> 38:39.300
We'll use the proceeds to buy
somewhere more manageable,

38:39.339 --> 38:41.700
and I can make sure Eli
and Sally are looked after.

38:41.700 --> 38:45.339
Did you consider my feelings, at
all, when you made this decision?

38:45.379 --> 38:46.700
Of course I did.

38:46.740 --> 38:49.979
You need to move out of Dad's shadow.

38:50.019 --> 38:51.939
Find your own path.

38:51.979 --> 38:53.620
I think this could be a good thing for you.

38:53.660 --> 38:57.539
Do you know, you sound
just like your father.

39:00.979 --> 39:03.740
He always enjoyed telling
me what was good for me.

39:06.620 --> 39:08.859
Well, thank you for taking
the time to inform me.

39:09.979 --> 39:12.740
Perhaps you'd be good enough to
let me know where I'll be moving to.

39:12.780 --> 39:15.140
When you get the chance, of course.

39:15.180 --> 39:16.899
I know how busy you are.

39:26.260 --> 39:28.620
Now, what did I do to deserve that?

39:28.660 --> 39:31.620
Mr Hobbs has left the company.

39:33.060 --> 39:34.140
When? Why?

39:36.300 --> 39:37.780
I can't take all the credit.

39:37.819 --> 39:40.180
I had to call in the heavies.

39:40.220 --> 39:42.819
So, that's it? It's done?

39:42.859 --> 39:45.899
Well, it is, as far as I'm concerned.

39:50.819 --> 39:53.740
Well...

39:53.780 --> 39:56.499
Might have to get myself another suit.

39:56.539 --> 39:58.459
And this time...

39:59.620 --> 40:01.300
..you can do my inside leg.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.539
Why don't you talk to her?

40:18.580 --> 40:21.419
She needs her mum.

40:21.459 --> 40:24.419
She needs her dad, too, Geordie.

40:43.819 --> 40:45.539
I'm not ready to forgive.

40:45.580 --> 40:48.499
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

40:48.539 --> 40:52.060
And that man is never to come here again.

40:52.100 --> 40:53.939
His name is Daniel.

40:53.979 --> 40:57.459
If that's a compromise
Leonard is prepared to make,

40:57.499 --> 40:59.499
then I'll consider coming back.

40:59.539 --> 41:00.859
I see.

41:06.939 --> 41:10.539
We don't work without you, Mrs C.

41:14.100 --> 41:15.859
We really don't.

41:27.140 --> 41:30.459
"Anyone who loves me
will obey my teaching."

41:30.499 --> 41:33.419
Jesus' advice was sound,

41:33.459 --> 41:35.459
because he was manifestly a good man.

41:35.499 --> 41:39.539
But I don't think those in
authority should be obeyed blindly.

41:39.580 --> 41:41.459
The parent.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.859
The teacher. The policeman.

41:43.859 --> 41:45.539
Even the village vicar.

41:47.419 --> 41:51.220
Don't take the wisdom of
those in authority for granted.

41:51.260 --> 41:53.379
Challenge it in your heart.

41:53.419 --> 41:56.819
Power can be misused.

41:56.859 --> 41:59.499
It can also corrupt.

42:00.740 --> 42:03.899
Sometimes the bravest thing we can do

42:03.939 --> 42:06.580
is admit we're not strong enough.

42:08.620 --> 42:12.859
Let those who love us shoulder the burden.

42:12.859 --> 42:15.260
And support them, too.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.539
As a wise man once told me,

42:17.580 --> 42:19.979
be kind,

42:20.019 --> 42:24.180
for everyone you meet is fighting
a battle you know nothing about.

42:25.819 --> 42:27.060
Thank you so much.

42:27.100 --> 42:28.459
Nice service.

42:28.499 --> 42:31.780
Ah, the show's over, I'm afraid.

42:33.220 --> 42:37.260
Actually, I was wondering if you
could help me organise something.

42:54.260 --> 42:56.660
You can stop pretending, Geordie.

42:56.700 --> 42:59.060
We all know you want to
get up there and dance.

42:59.100 --> 43:01.780
I don't get it. It's just noise.

43:01.819 --> 43:03.419
I said, it's just noise

43:05.060 --> 43:06.419
Oi, oi.

43:06.459 --> 43:08.339
That's Miss Reynolds.

43:09.859 --> 43:12.819
I take it all back. I'd much rather
be in her class than Mr Pope's.

43:27.019 --> 43:28.859
Good with kids as well.

43:28.899 --> 43:30.939
Fascinating.

43:30.979 --> 43:32.300
Shut up.

43:32.339 --> 43:35.620
Come on, grumpy. Show me what you got.

43:38.499 --> 43:41.220
You know, I'm very proud of
you. For what you did for her.

43:41.260 --> 43:43.499
Let's hope you're still as proud

43:43.539 --> 43:45.339
when you see how much we're spending.

43:47.100 --> 43:48.939
I'm sorry Daniel can't be here.

43:48.979 --> 43:50.539
So am I.

43:51.780 --> 43:54.939
On the plus side, he
doesn't have to see that.

44:00.019 --> 44:01.459
Come

44:01.499 --> 44:04.419
I think I'll sit this one out.

44:05.979 --> 44:08.140
Go.

44:08.180 --> 44:09.499
You might regret it.

44:13.019 --> 44:17.379
I'd ask you to dance, but I think
it might be a terrible mistake.

44:17.419 --> 44:21.620
Well, in that case, how
about you get me a drink?

44:24.660 --> 44:27.260
Dad, stop.

44:27.300 --> 44:28.660
Please.

44:31.499 --> 44:33.419
She likes motorbikes.

44:33.459 --> 44:36.379
She's a good dancer, too.

44:36.419 --> 44:39.339
If you told her to walk across the
Cam, you know she'd sink, right?

44:39.379 --> 44:40.979
I'd like to see her give it a go.

44:43.339 --> 44:45.300
Now, says she's the one you marry...

44:45.339 --> 44:46.899
I've only just met her, Geordie.

44:46.939 --> 44:48.180
Theoretically speaking.

44:49.260 --> 44:51.859
Are you seriously telling me you'd
wait until the wedding night?

44:51.899 --> 44:53.459
Of course.

44:55.459 --> 44:56.979
Bollocks.

44:57.019 --> 44:58.700
I'm not saying there wouldn't be -

44:58.740 --> 45:00.100
Fumbles under the jumper.

45:00.140 --> 45:01.740
Theoretically speaking.

45:01.780 --> 45:04.339
So... No, no more questions, Geordie.

45:04.379 --> 45:05.740
Last one.

45:05.780 --> 45:08.339
You meet a girl, you get married,

45:08.379 --> 45:10.379
she's no good in the sack...

45:10.419 --> 45:13.379
I prefer it when you're moaning
about the state of the country.

45:15.140 --> 45:16.660
You know what we need?

45:16.700 --> 45:18.100
A damn good war

45:18.140 --> 45:19.140
No.

45:19.180 --> 45:21.180
A pint, and a game of backgammon.

45:22.305 --> 45:28.574
