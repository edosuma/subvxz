that bad, man.

40:50.031 --> 40:51.283
Means a lot
coming from the champ.

40:51.283 --> 40:52.576
I ain't the champ no more.

40:52.576 --> 40:53.618
Nah, you'll get
back there soon.

40:53.618 --> 40:55.496
Put those gloves up.

40:55.496 --> 40:56.664
Don't fall into your punches.

40:56.664 --> 40:58.290
Keep the range!

40:58.290 --> 41:00.542
He's baiting you, man.
He's setting you up.

41:00.542 --> 41:02.085
Stick and move.

41:02.085 --> 41:03.587
Watch his feet.

41:03.587 --> 41:05.463
Watch the feet.

41:22.690 --> 41:24.692
Is Abby sick?

41:29.112 --> 41:30.655
Cancer?

41:36.704 --> 41:41.709
When your mother told me
she was sick,

41:41.709 --> 41:45.086
it felt like
the whole world

41:45.086 --> 41:47.715
shrunk to the size
of our bedroom.

41:47.715 --> 41:51.719

sitting there all alone.

41:51.719 --> 41:54.220
Scared out of our minds.

41:57.933 --> 42:00.936
How long after that before
you ran off with Claudette?

42:02.729 --> 42:05.691
It's more complicated
than you remember.

42:07.693 --> 42:11.613
What I remember is me and Terry
taking care of Mom.

42:11.613 --> 42:15.576
Bridget and Bunchy too.

42:15.576 --> 42:18.995
I remember...

42:18.995 --> 42:22.540
changing her bedpan...

42:22.540 --> 42:25.794
drainage tubes...

42:25.794 --> 42:28.171
packing their sack lunches.

42:31.634 --> 42:33.426
That's what I remember.

42:34.594 --> 42:36.554
I loved your mother, Ray.

42:36.554 --> 42:38.556
I loved her the best
that I could.

42:38.556 --> 42:43.103
Imperfect, sure,
but I-I fucking loved...

42:43.103 --> 42:46.564
[sighs]

42:46.564 --> 42:48.775
I did my best.

42:50.778 --> 42:53.613
I see how I rubbed off on you.

42:53.613 --> 42:55.240
Watching me
when you were young.

42:55.240 --> 42:56.366
Picking up my habits.

42:56.366 --> 42:58.994
Fuck I did.

42:58.994 --> 43:01.705
Your boy Conor,

43:01.705 --> 43:04.290
what are you showing him
about being a man?

43:04.290 --> 43:06.543
About being faithful
to a good woman?

43:06.543 --> 43:09.421
You better hope he's got more
forgiveness in him than you do.

43:21.683 --> 43:23.893
That money.

43:23.893 --> 43:25.729
Was it to get Belikov out?

43:27.815 --> 43:28.857
Yeah.

43:32.027 --> 43:33.779
What're you gonna do?

43:39.576 --> 43:41.244
Take me downtown.

43:44.080 --> 43:45.206
Where?

43:45.206 --> 43:47.083
Police station.

43:48.668 --> 43:51.171
Why?

43:51.171 --> 43:53.631
I'll take the rap
for the murders.

44:10.774 --> 44:13.443
You know they're gonna try
and kill you in there.

44:16.071 --> 44:17.947
I did time for you before, kid.

44:17.947 --> 44:20.742
Lived to tell about it.
I can do it again.

44:21.826 --> 44:23.661
It's not the same, Mick.

44:25.663 --> 44:28.792
Here.

44:28.792 --> 44:30.878
Your mother gave this to me.

44:35.256 --> 44:38.301
You were always my favorite.

44:38.301 --> 44:40.845
You fuckin'
don't think that's true.

44:40.845 --> 44:43.640
But the minute I first saw you,
in your eyes, I could tell,

44:43.640 --> 44:45.809
you were gonna give life a
fuckin' hard run for its money.

44:53.733 --> 44:56.904
Send my love to the family.

44:56.904 --> 44:58.822
You sure about this?

45:01.866 --> 45:04.285

for me.
