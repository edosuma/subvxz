to follow in his footsteps?

08:13.954 --> 08:15.354
Yeah, I trained as a chef, yeah.

08:33.732 --> 08:37.275
Was there something that you wanted
to do when you came back?

08:37.344 --> 08:39.979
Uh, I don't know, like...

08:40.047 --> 08:41.280
Oh, come now.

08:41.347 --> 08:44.250
The prodigal son returns
to his overbearing father.

08:44.318 --> 08:47.120
What could you possibly desire?

08:48.989 --> 08:51.190
I wanted...

08:51.258 --> 08:52.391
Yes?

08:53.827 --> 08:56.662
To have one more meal with my dad.

08:56.730 --> 08:59.365
(Chloe clears throat)

09:02.169 --> 09:04.103
(sighs) So you just
got into town last night?

09:04.171 --> 09:06.472
Yeah, I-I met Dad here for breakfast.

09:06.540 --> 09:09.175
Did you notice anything
strange about him or the meal?

09:09.243 --> 09:10.810
Anything?

09:10.878 --> 09:12.612
Dad had them bring out our usual.

09:12.679 --> 09:15.114
(chuckles) We were
actually getting along for once.

09:15.182 --> 09:17.016
Uh, after we finished eating,

09:17.084 --> 09:19.085
Dad left to do his pickup at the market.

09:19.153 --> 09:20.793
We were supposed to meet
up later tonight.

09:20.854 --> 09:22.814
Said he had something he
wanted to tell me, but...

09:22.856 --> 09:24.357
So now that Dad's gone,

09:24.424 --> 09:26.225
I'm guessing the restaurant goes to you?

09:26.293 --> 09:28.895
No, I don't... I don't
deserve this place.

09:29.963 --> 09:31.531
Dad knew that.

09:31.598 --> 09:33.099
(chuckles)

09:33.167 --> 09:34.133
Well, stay in town.

09:34.201 --> 09:35.601
We may have more questions for you.

09:38.438 --> 09:39.438
LUCIFER: Well.

09:39.506 --> 09:41.607
Isn't that a coincidence?

09:41.675 --> 09:42.909
Boy returns home,

09:42.976 --> 09:46.012
and, conveniently, his
pops drops the next day?

09:46.079 --> 09:48.414
(sighs) Lucky bastard.

09:48.482 --> 09:50.516
Maybe.

09:50.584 --> 09:52.818
Or maybe this is about something
more than anger,

09:52.886 --> 09:54.320
which they all had,

09:54.388 --> 09:57.657
but if Junior isn't
inheriting the restaurant, then who is?

10:01.395 --> 10:03.329
<i>LINDA: Well, I'm glad you
decided to come here,</i>

10:03.397 --> 10:07.533
but I'm not sure this is appropriate.

10:07.601 --> 10:08.868
Why?

10:08.936 --> 10:12.004
Well, Lucifer's your
boss and a client of mine.

10:12.072 --> 10:14.373
I can recommend you to someone else.

10:14.441 --> 10:16.576
No, I like you.

10:16.643 --> 10:18.744
Look, you helped Lucifer,
and I need you to help me.

10:18.812 --> 10:20.713
(sighs)

10:20.781 --> 10:22.381
What seems to be the problem?

10:23.884 --> 10:25.318
(sighs)

10:25.385 --> 10:27.587
I'm stuck in a place I don't belong,

10:27.654 --> 10:29.889
and I'm not going anywhere anytime soon.

10:29.957 --> 10:32.124
I need to figure out

10:32.192 --> 10:33.326
how to be more...

10:35.395 --> 10:36.796
normal.

10:36.863 --> 10:38.764
So...

10:38.832 --> 10:40.566
"So" what?

10:40.634 --> 10:43.069
Tell me what to do.

10:43.136 --> 10:45.504
Well, that's not how this works.

10:47.174 --> 10:49.242
Do I need to sleep with you too?

10:49.309 --> 10:50.576
What?

10:50.644 --> 10:52.478
Is that it?

10:52.546 --> 10:53.613
Uh, no.

10:53.680 --> 10:54.680
No, I'm good.

10:54.748 --> 10:55.615
I'm good.

10:55.682 --> 10:57.683
Really, I'm good.

10:57.751 --> 11:01.387
What I can give you...

11:01.455 --> 11:04.590
is my advice.

11:04.658 --> 11:07.293
So... if we want to feel
more connected to our environment,

11:07.361 --> 11:08.694
sometimes it's helpful

11:08.762 --> 11:12.098
if we actively embrace
it and those around you.

11:12.165 --> 11:14.133
That still sounds like sex.

11:14.201 --> 11:17.503
Okay. I meant, uh, engage in

11:17.571 --> 11:21.307
caring and meaningful relationships.

11:21.375 --> 11:23.542
Making friends.

11:23.610 --> 11:24.677
Forget it.

11:24.745 --> 11:25.811
This was a mistake.

11:25.879 --> 11:26.846
Mazikeen.

11:26.913 --> 11:28.014
Wait. If you could...

11:30.150 --> 11:32.051
What just happened?

11:32.119 --> 11:34.487
♪ ♪

11:34.554 --> 11:37.523
Something on your mind, partner?

11:39.259 --> 11:40.379
What's the gun for, Malcolm?

11:40.427 --> 11:43.429
Oh, you mean that gun you stole for me?

11:43.497 --> 11:44.964
That gun?

11:45.032 --> 11:46.299
I was wondering when you'd ask.

11:46.366 --> 11:47.333
You know what?

11:47.401 --> 11:49.068
I'm done playing your stupid games.

11:49.136 --> 11:50.970
You want to tell everyone I shot you,

11:51.038 --> 11:52.772
you go right ahead.

11:52.839 --> 11:55.174
But I'm gonna put an end to
whatever you're planning.

11:55.242 --> 11:56.776
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:56.843 --> 11:57.910
Hey, chill, Dan.

11:57.978 --> 12:01.013
God, you went from zero to 100 so fast.

12:01.081 --> 12:02.248
The way I see it,

12:02.316 --> 12:03.983
I'm doing you a favor.

12:04.051 --> 12:05.757
(chuckles) A favor?

12:05.908 --> 12:07.887
Another man spends so
much time with my wife,

12:07.954 --> 12:09.722
I sure wouldn't like it.

12:09.790 --> 12:12.525
Especially knowing this
guy's so dangerous.

12:14.328 --> 12:16.095
You want to kill Lucifer?

12:16.163 --> 12:17.763
Why?

12:17.831 --> 12:19.498
If I told you,

12:19.566 --> 12:20.933
I promise,

12:21.001 --> 12:22.535
you wouldn't believe me.

12:23.870 --> 12:25.471
But before you go

12:25.539 --> 12:28.674
growing any more balls, remember this...

12:28.742 --> 12:29.787
(sighs)

12:29.899 --> 12:31.477
You thinking about taking
another shot at me,

12:31.545 --> 12:33.479
try to take me down?

12:35.449 --> 12:37.550
Don't miss.

12:40.687 --> 12:43.189
So you're Anne Martin, the sous chef.

12:43.256 --> 12:44.336
You're Javier's number two?

12:44.391 --> 12:45.691
ANNE: I mean, I guess I was.

12:45.759 --> 12:48.361
I mean, I-I can't believe it.

12:48.428 --> 12:50.262
I... I just saw Pops this morning.

12:50.330 --> 12:51.464
He was fine.

12:51.531 --> 12:53.251
And you cooked his last
meal, is that right?

12:53.300 --> 12:54.600
So?

12:54.668 --> 12:56.828
You know how many people
had their hands on that plate?

12:56.870 --> 12:58.404
Well, this is your kitchen, Anne.

12:58.472 --> 13:00.032
When Pops isn't here, you run the show.

13:00.073 --> 13:01.173
And from what I understand,

13:01.241 --> 13:03.259
you're not someone to
be messed with, so...

13:03.388 --> 13:05.378
you really think
someone's gonna go behind your back?

13:05.445 --> 13:06.979
I can't control what they do.

13:07.047 --> 13:08.781
Who knows what kind of psychos we have?

13:08.849 --> 13:10.049
Well, are any of these psychos

13:10.050 --> 13:11.770
set to inherit the
restaurant, like you are?

13:12.619 --> 13:13.953
I spoke to his estate attorney.

13:14.020 --> 13:16.989
It's no secret Javier was
grooming me to take over.

13:17.057 --> 13:18.524
He was my mentor.

13:18.592 --> 13:20.326
Well, of all the reasons to
kill your father figure,

13:20.394 --> 13:22.027
greed is truly the ugliest.

13:22.095 --> 13:24.497
You think I killed Pops to
speed up my inheritance?

13:24.564 --> 13:26.832
I would never do anything to hurt him.

13:26.900 --> 13:27.967
He taught me everything.

13:28.034 --> 13:29.101
He meant the world
to me. (phone buzzing)

13:29.169 --> 13:32.204
LUCIFER: Well...

13:32.272 --> 13:33.992
If you didn't wish your
dear old "Pops" ill,

13:34.007 --> 13:36.509
what did you wish?

13:36.576 --> 13:38.844
To surpass him.

13:38.912 --> 13:40.212
Ah! So the student

13:40.280 --> 13:41.814
becomes the master, eh?

13:41.882 --> 13:43.249
What? No! It's not like that.

13:43.316 --> 13:44.583
CHLOE: Preliminary tox screen came in.

13:44.651 --> 13:47.253
The poison used to
kill Javier was mercury.

13:47.320 --> 13:48.354
Oh.

13:48.422 --> 13:49.655
So you cracked open a few thermometers

13:49.723 --> 13:50.923
over brunch, did you?

13:50.991 --> 13:53.025
Not the trick I'd
use, but clearly effective.

13:53.093 --> 13:55.161
There was something
else in his system, too.

13:55.228 --> 13:56.548
Can I see the inside of your arms?

13:56.563 --> 13:57.596
Why?

13:57.664 --> 13:58.631
Track marks.

13:58.698 --> 14:00.266
Ah, so there was heroin as well?

14:00.333 --> 14:02.001
Generous killer, aren't you?

14:02.068 --> 14:04.003
Wanted to give him a
little high on the way out?

14:04.070 --> 14:05.471
This is crazy. No. If you...

14:05.539 --> 14:07.873
if it's heroin, you should talk to...

14:07.941 --> 14:09.608
I'm sorry.

14:09.676 --> 14:10.843
Don't worry.

14:10.911 --> 14:12.745
I tend to have a rather
striking effect on women.

14:12.813 --> 14:13.913
Come on.

14:13.980 --> 14:15.781
Just let it all out.

14:15.849 --> 14:17.183
Oh!

14:17.250 --> 14:19.919
Okay.

14:19.986 --> 14:21.353
Someone call an ambulance!

14:21.421 --> 14:23.509
Well, I've never had that effect.

14:34.376 --> 14:36.110
Do you still think she's a suspect?

14:36.178 --> 14:37.658
We can arrest her now, if you'd like.

14:37.713 --> 14:40.047
You know, once she's done
getting her stomach pumped.

14:40.115 --> 14:41.716
What I want to know is...

14:41.783 --> 14:43.783
did she ingest the same
thing as Javier by mistake?

14:43.785 --> 14:46.887
Or was she poisoned, too?

14:46.955 --> 14:48.189
Why did she survive?

14:48.256 --> 14:50.825
Well, perhaps the killer
simply ran out of thermometers.

14:50.892 --> 14:52.226
Who would have a bone to pick

14:52.294 --> 14:53.794
with Javier and his number two?

14:53.862 --> 14:55.096
Oh, I don't know.

14:55.163 --> 14:56.697
Perhaps someone who was kicked
out of the family biz?

14:56.765 --> 14:58.065
You mean Junior.

14:58.133 --> 15:00.234
Well, he seemed like a
very troubled young man to me.

15:00.302 --> 15:01.369
Yeah.

15:01.436 --> 15:03.304
It's almost as if his dad just died.

15:04.706 --> 15:06.906
Oh, and look who decided to
grace us with his douchedom.

15:06.908 --> 15:08.009
Daniel...

15:08.076 --> 15:10.277
Hey. Did you find something?

15:10.345 --> 15:11.712
A Naomi Austen.

15:11.780 --> 15:14.281
She worked as a hostess here
last year till she was fired.

15:14.349 --> 15:16.117
She has two arrests
for heroin possession

15:16.184 --> 15:17.351
over the last year alone.

15:17.419 --> 15:19.820
Poor girl doesn't
learn her lesson, does she?

15:19.888 --> 15:20.855
Naomi Austen.

15:20.922 --> 15:22.323
That name sounds familiar.

15:22.391 --> 15:23.991
Oh, okay.

15:24.059 --> 15:26.560
So one of the cooks said
that she showed up two days ago,

15:26.628 --> 15:28.429
and was yelling at
Javier and Anne, so...

15:28.497 --> 15:30.464
I'll see if her P.O. has an address.

15:30.532 --> 15:32.199
It's already in the file.

15:32.267 --> 15:33.827
Look at you two, like Cagney and Lacey.

15:33.835 --> 15:36.404
You don't care who you piss off, do you?

15:36.471 --> 15:37.538
Not in the slightest, no.

15:37.606 --> 15:39.206
(under breath) Oh, my God.

15:39.274 --> 15:40.241
Oh, wait!

15:40.308 --> 15:41.909
Um, Dan. Um...

15:44.446 --> 15:45.646
So, uh, if you don't have plans tonight,

15:45.714 --> 15:48.783
my mom is having this family dinner...

15:48.850 --> 15:50.951
And you could really use a buffer.

15:51.019 --> 15:52.386
Yeah.

15:52.454 --> 15:54.321
Sure. Send me the details.

15:54.389 --> 15:55.489
All right.

15:55.557 --> 15:57.224
LUCIFER: Detective...

15:57.292 --> 15:59.060
do you mind if we
make a stop on the way?

15:59.127 --> 16:01.462
I mean, this shirt's more
of a loaner, really.

16:02.998 --> 16:04.932
(buzzing)

16:08.937 --> 16:11.672
(Chloe sighs)

16:11.740 --> 16:13.474
Still no answer.

16:16.378 --> 16:19.246
OJ... spoons, foil.

16:19.314 --> 16:20.614
Looks like a junkie...

16:25.520 --> 16:27.788
What do you think you're doing?

16:27.856 --> 16:30.124
Well, I found
something far more interesting.

16:30.192 --> 16:31.292
We don't have a warrant.

16:31.359 --> 16:32.860
We don't have time for
warrants, Detective!

16:32.928 --> 16:35.129
Look. Junior was here.

16:35.197 --> 16:36.263
Junior was staying here?

16:37.265 --> 16:38.799
He and Naomi must be close.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.334
Yeah, well, they probably
chased the dragon together

16:40.402 --> 16:41.602
after Junior killed his dad

16:41.670 --> 16:43.871
and then sat and
looked at the twinkly lights.

16:43.939 --> 16:45.819
Why have they still got
their Christmas tree up?

16:45.874 --> 16:47.108
We don't know what happened.

16:47.175 --> 16:49.009
Well, maybe something in
here will help clear that up.

16:49.077 --> 16:51.612
Right. Uh...

16:52.881 --> 16:54.949
Board shorts.

16:55.016 --> 16:56.984
Don't know what more proof
you need that he's deranged.

16:57.052 --> 16:59.053
We're not supposed to be in here.

16:59.121 --> 17:00.588
Oh, come on.

17:00.655 --> 17:01.856
(sighs)

17:01.923 --> 17:04.358
So let's just search the place fast.

17:04.425 --> 17:06.060
Oh! Well, well.

17:06.127 --> 17:07.862
Lead the way, Detective.

17:07.929 --> 17:09.463
All right.

17:10.799 --> 17:14.034
(couple moaning in
pleasure, bed springs squeaking)

17:14.102 --> 17:15.469
Oh... I... can...

17:15.537 --> 17:16.637
can you hear that?

17:16.704 --> 17:19.073
Yeah. And since when
has that bothered you?

17:19.141 --> 17:20.441
WOMAN: Oh, God!

17:20.509 --> 17:22.041
And dear old Dad strikes again.

17:22.109 --> 17:23.911
- I mean...
- (giggles)

17:23.979 --> 17:25.579
- It's not funny.
- It's kind of funny.

17:25.646 --> 17:26.967
Well, that's easy for you to say.

17:27.015 --> 17:28.516
You're not the one being
taunted, are you?

17:28.583 --> 17:30.684
"Oh, God" this! "Oh, God" that!

17:30.752 --> 17:33.420
He's popping up everywhere and
spoiling my favorite things!

17:33.488 --> 17:35.589
I'd really hate to be in your head.

17:35.657 --> 17:36.757
Well, why would you understand?

17:36.825 --> 17:38.759
Your mother's absolutely delightful.

17:38.827 --> 17:40.628
<i>Oh, of course you think she is.</i>

17:40.695 --> 17:41.428
Oh...

17:41.496 --> 17:43.364
Do I detect some angst?

17:46.234 --> 17:47.802
She's like a child.

17:47.869 --> 17:49.570
- Oh, and I bet it drove you crazy.
- Yeah.

17:49.638 --> 17:52.339
All she wanted was to doll me
up and take me to auditions.

17:52.407 --> 17:54.141
Would make anyone mad with rage.

17:54.209 --> 17:55.609
She made everything about her.

17:55.677 --> 17:58.579
So you could just murder her!

17:58.647 --> 17:59.713
Sure.

17:59.781 --> 18:01.048
But I didn't.

18:01.116 --> 18:03.083
And you're still not
proving your point about Junior.

18:03.151 --> 18:04.718
(sighs)

18:04.786 --> 18:05.686
Fair enough.

18:05.754 --> 18:07.822
So how did you handle it, anyway?

18:07.889 --> 18:09.790
You know, besides taking your
anger out on criminals?

18:09.858 --> 18:11.158
I don't know.

18:11.226 --> 18:14.195
I guess I just always tried to

18:14.262 --> 18:17.598
focus on something else.

18:17.666 --> 18:18.866
This is...

18:18.934 --> 18:20.334
weird.

18:28.577 --> 18:29.643
Well! That painting

18:29.711 --> 18:31.612
just became far more valuable.

18:31.680 --> 18:32.880
- (door opens)
- Oh.

18:34.182 --> 18:35.916
Hello, Naomi.

18:35.984 --> 18:37.084
Who the hell are you?

18:37.152 --> 18:38.085
Heroin inspector.

18:38.153 --> 18:39.320
I'm afraid your spoons

18:39.387 --> 18:41.088
aren't up to standard, so...

18:41.156 --> 18:42.423
Hold on.

18:42.490 --> 18:44.024
We have some questions for you.

18:46.294 --> 18:47.728
<i>NAOMI: You think I killed Javier?</i>

18:47.796 --> 18:49.697
Well, I don't. But she definitely does.

18:49.764 --> 18:51.332
But she thought it
was the sous chef before,

18:51.399 --> 18:52.519
so don't take it personally.

18:52.534 --> 18:53.834
(Chloe clears throat)

18:55.403 --> 18:57.771
The poison that killed
Javier was laced with heroin.

18:57.839 --> 18:59.807
We know you use and we
know that you had a fight

18:59.875 --> 19:02.810
with Javier and Anne
Martin two days ago.

19:02.878 --> 19:03.777
Okay, I admit,

19:03.845 --> 19:05.779
I went to see Pops a few days ago,

19:05.847 --> 19:07.381
'cause Junior called me to tell me

19:07.449 --> 19:09.316
he was coming back home.

19:09.384 --> 19:11.919
I just wanted to make
peace with his dad.

19:11.987 --> 19:13.053
Make peace? Why?

19:13.121 --> 19:14.820
Because he didn't want us together.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.550
- So you're dating Junior.
- We were.

19:16.591 --> 19:18.726
A year ago, before he left.

19:18.793 --> 19:22.897
And I thought,
maybe, when he came back...

19:22.964 --> 19:24.498
But Pops never approved.

19:24.566 --> 19:26.400
Well, I can't see why they're not fans

19:26.468 --> 19:28.669
of your whole Kurt and Courtney vibe.

19:28.737 --> 19:31.005
I tried to tell him that
Junior got clean on his travels,

19:31.072 --> 19:32.840
but it didn't matter.

19:32.908 --> 19:35.109
Javier said he would never support us.

19:35.176 --> 19:36.377
I got upset.

19:36.444 --> 19:37.884
What happened with you at breakfast?

19:37.913 --> 19:40.014
Nothing.

19:40.081 --> 19:41.415
I wasn't even at breakfast.

19:41.483 --> 19:43.617
Junior wanted to see his dad alone.

19:43.685 --> 19:45.052
I went to see my sponsor.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.054
I've been having a
tough time of it lately.

19:47.122 --> 19:48.555
All right.

19:48.623 --> 19:49.690
Until we can confirm that,

19:49.758 --> 19:51.358
we need you to come down to the station.

19:51.393 --> 19:52.826
Why, pray tell,

19:52.894 --> 19:54.895
did Junior want to see his dad alone?

19:54.963 --> 19:57.064
He just said that he
wanted to make it right.

19:57.132 --> 19:58.632
That all he needed to do

19:58.700 --> 20:01.335
was confront his
father and settle things.

20:01.403 --> 20:03.504
- (laughs)
- Hmm.

20:03.571 --> 20:05.239
You don't think that...

20:05.307 --> 20:06.640
He killed him?

20:06.708 --> 20:09.476
Junior told us he wanted to
have one more meal with his dad.

20:09.544 --> 20:10.945
It seems he did...

20:11.012 --> 20:12.579
a rather final one.

20:14.249 --> 20:15.416
Do you know where he is?

20:15.483 --> 20:18.585
I haven't talked to
him since this morning.

20:23.091 --> 20:24.491
CHLOE: APB on Junior's out.

20:24.559 --> 20:25.960
We're trying to ping his cell.

20:26.027 --> 20:28.095
I'm glad we're finally on the same page.

20:28.163 --> 20:29.697
You know, ever since we met this kid,

20:29.764 --> 20:31.365
you've had it in for him. Why?

20:31.433 --> 20:33.834
Guess he's a bird of a feather.

20:33.902 --> 20:36.704
Someone who had a shadow cast
over him his entire life.

20:36.771 --> 20:38.238
Whereas I could never
escape from under mine...

20:38.306 --> 20:39.974
he could.

20:40.041 --> 20:42.042
I wonder how that feels.

20:42.110 --> 20:43.043
(phone rings)

20:43.111 --> 20:44.812
Decker.

20:46.414 --> 20:48.115
No. No, you did the right thing.

20:48.183 --> 20:49.016
I'm on my way.

20:49.084 --> 20:50.184
Did they find Junior?

20:50.251 --> 20:51.151
No. I gotta go.

20:51.219 --> 20:52.252
But we've a killer to catch!

20:52.320 --> 20:53.887
And we will. This is an emergency.

20:55.390 --> 20:56.557
(knocking) Detective!

20:56.624 --> 20:58.058
Come on!

20:58.126 --> 20:59.026
Oh...

20:59.094 --> 21:01.562
(tires squealing)

21:01.629 --> 21:04.665
You've got to stop doing that!

21:06.768 --> 21:07.701
(sighs)

21:07.769 --> 21:08.836
Oh, no.

21:08.903 --> 21:11.672
Nana says we're gonna be in a movie!

21:11.740 --> 21:12.906
(scoffs)

21:12.974 --> 21:14.675
PENELOPE: No, no, no.

21:16.077 --> 21:18.379
So the babysitter called

21:18.446 --> 21:20.547
and said that you let her off early.

21:20.615 --> 21:22.215
Yeah, 'cause we didn't need her anymore.

21:23.018 --> 21:24.218
We were just on our way

21:24.285 --> 21:25.986
to our first audition.

21:26.054 --> 21:27.121
Ooh, isn't that a thrill?

21:27.188 --> 21:28.422
You didn't think to ask me about that?

21:28.490 --> 21:30.491
What do you mean, "our" audition?

21:30.558 --> 21:32.159
I am up for a new role,

21:32.227 --> 21:33.427
and I thought it would be good

21:33.495 --> 21:34.995
to play off of somebody.

21:35.063 --> 21:36.196
Oh, okay.

21:36.264 --> 21:38.399
Can I talk to you for a sec?

21:38.466 --> 21:39.786
So you thought it'd be a good idea

21:39.801 --> 21:41.668
to use Trixie as a prop?

21:41.736 --> 21:42.736
A co-star.

21:42.804 --> 21:44.271
Everyone's gotta start somewhere.

21:44.339 --> 21:47.007
And isn't she the cutest
little lounge singer you've ever seen?

21:47.075 --> 21:48.442
She looks ridiculous.

21:48.510 --> 21:50.878
How can you exploit your
family for your next acting job?

21:50.945 --> 21:52.465
You know, for someone who hated acting,

21:52.480 --> 21:54.148
you sure know how to be dramatic.

21:54.215 --> 21:55.182
You can't do this.

21:55.250 --> 21:56.550
You can't push Trixie into this

21:56.618 --> 21:58.152
the way that you pushed me.

21:58.219 --> 21:59.853
You can't walk in here...

21:59.921 --> 22:01.688
Like I own the place?

22:01.756 --> 22:03.057
The place you're living in

22:03.124 --> 22:05.292
rent free?

22:05.360 --> 22:06.593
You asked me to stay here.

22:06.661 --> 22:08.962
You have no right to take her...

22:10.465 --> 22:12.433
Where is she?

22:13.334 --> 22:14.301
She was just here.

22:14.369 --> 22:15.669
Trixie?

22:16.771 --> 22:17.771
Trix?

22:19.174 --> 22:21.308
Trixie?

22:21.376 --> 22:22.910
Trixie!

22:22.977 --> 22:25.533
She's gone.

22:30.010 --> 22:33.057
I've called her friends,
I've called our neighbors.

22:33.125 --> 22:34.959
No one has heard from her. No.

22:35.027 --> 22:38.863
All right, I'll call
you if I hear anything.

22:38.930 --> 22:40.464
Dan hasn't heard from her.

22:40.532 --> 22:41.666
Take a breath, Chloe.

22:41.733 --> 22:43.467
She's a smart
girl... where would she go?

22:43.535 --> 22:44.969
I don't know.

22:45.037 --> 22:47.171
- She left and...
- (phone chimes)

22:48.874 --> 22:49.840
What?

22:49.908 --> 22:51.275
What is it?

22:51.343 --> 22:54.979
She ordered a ride from my Uber account.

Which one wants you to
look like an old drag queen?

24:14.159 --> 24:16.727
My grandma, I guess.

24:16.795 --> 24:20.197
They're fighting over what
they want me to be when I grow up.

24:20.265 --> 24:21.632
What do you want to be?

24:21.700 --> 24:24.902
I want to be the first
president of Mars.

24:24.970 --> 24:26.771
Or a zookeeper.

24:26.838 --> 24:28.873
Mm-hmm.

24:28.940 --> 24:31.642
I used to be a zookeeper.

24:50.462 --> 24:52.062
I wanted to see Lucifer.

24:52.130 --> 24:53.964
But he wasn't here.

24:54.032 --> 24:56.367
So I made a new friend.

25:06.845 --> 25:09.446

You know, to finally be free.

25:23.762 --> 25:25.796
I mean, you're about to be arrested.

25:25.864 --> 25:28.399
But, uh, at least you're free of him.

25:28.466 --> 25:29.667
What are you talking about?

25:29.734 --> 25:30.701
Your father!

25:30.769 --> 25:32.469
You killed him. Tell me all about it.

25:32.537 --> 25:34.605
I mean, is the air a little sweeter?

25:34.673 --> 25:37.007
Is the sun a little brighter?

25:37.075 --> 25:38.475
I didn't kill my dad, man.

25:38.543 --> 25:40.211
Oh, come on... why return to dispose

25:40.278 --> 25:41.946
of the murder weapon then?

25:42.013 --> 25:42.980
The heroin.

25:43.048 --> 25:44.215
Sorry, it's all gone.

25:44.282 --> 25:45.416
Police took it away for testing.

25:45.483 --> 25:47.718
Well, (chuckles) most of it.

25:47.786 --> 25:48.586
"Heroin"?

25:48.653 --> 25:49.753
No, I

25:49.821 --> 25:51.021
came for this.

25:51.089 --> 25:52.556
Ah-ah-ah-ah

25:52.624 --> 25:55.693
Careful, Junior, you
don't who you're playing with.

25:55.760 --> 25:56.660
What?

25:56.728 --> 25:57.862
No.

25:57.929 --> 26:00.064
(sighs)

26:00.131 --> 26:02.433
My dad gave me this knife.

26:02.500 --> 26:04.501
It's all I have left from him.

26:06.471 --> 26:08.672
You're not relieved he's gone at all.

26:08.740 --> 26:10.574
Why would I be relieved?

26:10.642 --> 26:12.082
Because he was judgmental and cruel,

26:12.143 --> 26:14.245
and he tried to force you into
being someone you're not.

26:14.312 --> 26:16.013
And he's gone now.

26:16.081 --> 26:17.982
So you can finally be your own man.

26:18.049 --> 26:19.583
Oh, dear.

26:19.651 --> 26:21.785
You didn't kill him, did you?

26:21.853 --> 26:23.787
Of course not.

26:23.855 --> 26:25.723
(sighs)

26:25.790 --> 26:28.525
So, are you gonna arrest me or what?

26:34.599 --> 26:36.133
Hi, Trixie!

26:36.201 --> 26:38.202
I'm so glad you're back.

26:38.270 --> 26:39.910
Listen, Nana needs to
explain something...

26:39.971 --> 26:42.172
- Mom, let's just have dinner, okay?
- (knocks)

26:42.240 --> 26:44.074
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Dan!

26:44.142 --> 26:46.243
What a pleasant surprise.

26:46.311 --> 26:49.013
- And you brought dessert.
- Of course.

26:49.080 --> 26:51.315
So thoughtful as always.

26:51.383 --> 26:52.917
So good to see you, Penny.

26:52.984 --> 26:54.218
Something smells amazing.

26:54.286 --> 26:55.653
- Mmm.
- Yeah, Mom.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.421
Where'd you buy this
nice home-cooked meal?

26:57.489 --> 26:59.523
Oh, there's no take-out tonight.

26:59.591 --> 27:00.824
Lucifer

27:00.892 --> 27:02.626
has provided the meal.

27:02.694 --> 27:03.928
Wait.

27:03.995 --> 27:05.296
Lucifer's here?

27:05.363 --> 27:07.398
He and his friend have
been here a while.

27:07.465 --> 27:08.465
- His friend?
- LUCIFER: Ah!

27:08.533 --> 27:10.935
Detective! Just in time.

27:11.002 --> 27:12.670
Uh, you remember Junior?

27:12.737 --> 27:13.604
Of course.

27:13.672 --> 27:16.206
Just wait until you taste his molé.

27:16.274 --> 27:18.409
It is to die for.

27:24.781 --> 27:26.379
- Lucifer!
- LUCIFER: Oh, get back!

27:26.380 --> 27:28.780
Okay, monkey, surprise.

27:28.848 --> 27:30.415
You get to eat
chocolate cake in bed tonight.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.017
Why?

27:32.085 --> 27:33.251
Does it matter?

27:33.319 --> 27:35.253
Nope.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.155
Junior, if you wouldn't mind.

27:37.223 --> 27:39.624
(clears throat)

27:39.692 --> 27:41.626
- Yes?
- So you brought

27:41.694 --> 27:44.596
a guy who's suspected
of murder by poisoning

27:44.664 --> 27:47.232
to cook for my family?

27:47.300 --> 27:48.400
Well, if you arrest him,

27:48.468 --> 27:49.768
he's just going to lawyer up, isn't he?

27:49.836 --> 27:51.770
So why not have a nice meal

27:51.838 --> 27:53.271
whilst you get all the
answers you need, hmm?

27:53.339 --> 27:54.806
I'm certain he'll open up.

27:54.874 --> 27:56.007
Why is that?

27:56.075 --> 27:57.242
Because I convinced
him you'd hear him out.

27:57.310 --> 27:58.543
After all, he's innocent.

27:58.611 --> 27:59.911
Oh, you think he's innocent now?

27:59.979 --> 28:01.079
Come on, Detective.

28:01.147 --> 28:02.781
If you're not
satisfied with his answers,

28:02.849 --> 28:04.149
you can always arrest him afterwards.

28:04.217 --> 28:05.337
JUNIOR: I stopped eating meat

28:05.351 --> 28:08.220
while backpacking through India,

28:08.287 --> 28:11.590
so I had to get creative with my dishes.

28:11.657 --> 28:14.392
This is my vegetarian take

28:14.460 --> 28:17.295
on Oaxacan molé with a tart,

28:17.363 --> 28:18.663
vegan crème fraîche.

28:18.731 --> 28:21.199
- Sounds so exotic.
- Lovely.

28:21.267 --> 28:22.434
I cannot wait to dig in.

28:22.502 --> 28:24.870
- Mom, don't eat that!
- Why not?

28:24.937 --> 28:26.337
She's worried it might be poisoned.

28:26.339 --> 28:28.140
- You are?
- Oh, that's right.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.408
Let's catch you up,
shall we? Um, I brought

28:30.476 --> 28:31.610
Junior here tonight

28:31.677 --> 28:32.711
because Detective Decker believes

28:32.778 --> 28:33.745
that he killed his father.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.647
- You do?
- What are you doing, man?

28:35.715 --> 28:37.835
But I believe he was after
something far more foolish.

28:37.850 --> 28:38.717
Reconciliation.

28:38.784 --> 28:40.385
JUNIOR: That's right.

28:40.453 --> 28:41.820
I didn't kill my dad.

28:41.888 --> 28:42.821
Do you have proof?

28:42.889 --> 28:45.557
Just my word.

28:45.625 --> 28:47.385
Well, we might need something
more than that.

28:47.426 --> 28:48.827
Oh, come on,
Detective, you said yourself

28:48.895 --> 28:50.795
you may want to kill your mother,
but you don't do it.

28:50.863 --> 28:52.864
Oh, so you want to kill me
now? Just because I put makeup

28:52.932 --> 28:54.559
- on your daughter?
- No, because she thinks

28:54.584 --> 28:56.091
thinks you're a child and forced her

28:56.135 --> 28:58.003
to grow up too quickly.

28:59.138 --> 29:00.438
Am I wrong?

29:00.506 --> 29:01.806
You're way out line, man.

29:01.874 --> 29:04.476
There he goes
leaping to her defense again.

29:04.544 --> 29:05.677
You know, perhaps you two are closer

29:05.745 --> 29:07.179
to getting back together than I thought.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.646
- You are?
- No, we haven't decided.

29:08.681 --> 29:10.148
Things are moving that way.

29:10.216 --> 29:12.117
We just had the one kiss.

29:12.185 --> 29:13.065
So you're kissing now?

29:13.119 --> 29:14.386
Right.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.453
Maybe that explains why
you won't have sex with me.

29:16.489 --> 29:17.689
I'm sorry, what?

29:17.757 --> 29:19.024
No.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.292
You're juggling

29:20.359 --> 29:22.694
both these handsome gentlemen?

29:22.762 --> 29:25.630
I'm not juggling anything.

29:25.698 --> 29:26.932
Well, trust me, honey,

29:26.999 --> 29:28.166
you better do something,

29:28.234 --> 29:29.501
'cause you're not getting any younger.

29:29.569 --> 29:31.529
However, what do I know?
Because I'm just a child.

29:31.571 --> 29:34.072
If you don't like it, why
don't you stop acting like one?

29:34.140 --> 29:37.309
(laughing)

29:37.376 --> 29:40.545
You guys sound just like me and my dad.

29:40.613 --> 29:44.916
We used to fight all the
time over the dumbest stuff.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.885
That's why I left.

29:46.953 --> 29:50.655
But no matter what I
did, I couldn't get away.

29:50.723 --> 29:52.857
You know, 'cause every time

29:52.925 --> 29:55.493
I cooked a meal or I
looked in the mirror,

29:55.561 --> 29:59.297
there he was staring back at me.

29:59.365 --> 30:00.565
That's a tad bit creepy.

30:00.633 --> 30:03.435
Because he's a part of me, man.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.270
You know, he may have pushed too hard,

30:05.338 --> 30:07.906
and-and-and tried to make
me something that I'm not,

30:07.974 --> 30:12.577
but in the end, it made me the man I am.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.913
And I'm proud of who I've become.

30:14.981 --> 30:16.982
Yeah, I came back home

30:17.049 --> 30:20.285
so I could tell him that I was clean.

30:20.353 --> 30:22.787
And I want to be a chef again.

30:22.855 --> 30:24.489
And this meal?

30:24.557 --> 30:27.058
Was what I was gonna
make for him to prove it.

30:27.126 --> 30:28.893
Well, it looks

30:28.961 --> 30:31.630
very good.

30:34.333 --> 30:35.834
I didn't kill my dad.

30:35.901 --> 30:39.838
All right, so either arrest
me or let me go.

30:41.474 --> 30:43.475
Well, we are gonna need
you to come downtown,

30:43.542 --> 30:44.509
and make a statement.

30:44.577 --> 30:46.144
DAN: Please.

30:46.212 --> 30:48.713
Let me... I'm happy to
have an excuse to leave.

30:48.781 --> 30:49.848
Dan...

30:49.915 --> 30:51.716
Don't go.

30:52.952 --> 30:55.854
I wanted one reason to stick up for you.

30:56.889 --> 30:59.758
Just one. Let's go, pal.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.663
Well...

31:04.730 --> 31:07.265
I have suddenly lost my appetite.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.100
(sighs)

31:09.168 --> 31:11.536
Absolutely.

31:11.604 --> 31:13.171
I hope you're happy.

31:13.239 --> 31:16.174
No, actually, I'm
extremely disappointed.

31:16.242 --> 31:17.562
- Because you ruined dinner?
- No.

31:17.576 --> 31:20.412
Because Junior's answer was
spectacularly unhelpful.

31:20.479 --> 31:21.546
He didn't escape

31:21.614 --> 31:23.094
his father because he turned into him.

31:23.115 --> 31:25.717
I mean, that doesn't apply to me at all!

31:32.992 --> 31:34.526
(sighs)

31:40.866 --> 31:41.766
(clears throat)

31:41.834 --> 31:43.068
So I cleaned up.

31:43.135 --> 31:44.736
The food, I mean.

31:44.804 --> 31:46.538
It wasn't quite the
same as Chef Javier's.

31:46.605 --> 31:49.240
But I have to admit,
the boy can cook, so...

31:49.308 --> 31:52.877
I see you're still working the case.

31:52.945 --> 31:54.379
You were right.

31:54.447 --> 31:55.847
Junior's innocent.

31:55.915 --> 31:58.483
Well, glad you
learned something at dinner.

31:58.551 --> 31:59.551
No, the lab called.

31:59.618 --> 32:01.119
The heroin that we found at Naomi's

32:01.187 --> 32:03.355
doesn't match the
kind that killed Javier.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.023
So if Junior didn't kill his dad,

32:05.091 --> 32:07.459
why use heroin?

32:07.526 --> 32:09.828
To frame him, maybe?

32:09.895 --> 32:10.695
Yeah.

32:10.763 --> 32:11.996
I thought about that, too.

32:12.064 --> 32:14.232
But the only person with
motive got poisoned herself.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.468
Unless she knew exactly
how much to give herself.

32:16.535 --> 32:19.137
Creating all the gruesome symptoms,

32:19.205 --> 32:22.240
but without the finale, yeah...

32:22.308 --> 32:24.609
But the restaurant was hers,

32:24.677 --> 32:26.611
so why would she do it?

32:26.679 --> 32:29.981
I don't know, maybe
Pops had a change of heart.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.083
Decided to bring
Junior back into the fold

32:32.151 --> 32:34.886
after he found out he'd
changed and was coming home?

32:42.695 --> 32:43.935
Yeah, this is Detective Decker.

32:43.963 --> 32:46.865
I'm calling about a
patient, Anne Martin.

32:46.932 --> 32:47.966
Yeah.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.002
An hour ago?

32:51.070 --> 32:53.004
Yeah, thanks.

32:55.007 --> 32:56.941
Guess who checked out against orders.

32:57.009 --> 33:00.145
Well, I wonder where
our lovely sous-chef's

33:00.212 --> 33:01.880
headed in such a hurry.

33:01.947 --> 33:03.915
(chuckles)

33:11.290 --> 33:13.258
LUCIFER: Bravo.

33:13.325 --> 33:14.565
That's a brilliant hiding place.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.294
No wonder the police couldn't
find it earlier.

33:16.362 --> 33:17.629
What are you doing here?

33:17.696 --> 33:18.963
Well, we'd ask you the same question,

33:19.031 --> 33:20.365
but we already know you're
destroying evidence.

33:20.433 --> 33:21.766
Because you killed Javier.

33:21.834 --> 33:24.369
I told you, I would never
do anything to hurt Javier.

33:24.437 --> 33:26.638
You seem genuinely upset.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.640
Like you didn't want Javier to die.

33:28.707 --> 33:31.176
You humans are quite the
paradox, aren't you?

33:31.243 --> 33:32.977
You're always
killing your loved ones and...

33:33.045 --> 33:35.046
Unless the poison wasn't meant for him.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.916
You meant to kill Junior, didn't you?

33:37.983 --> 33:39.184
What?

33:39.251 --> 33:40.452
Oh.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.120
Hence the drugs.

33:42.188 --> 33:43.755
He'd die a grisly death,

33:43.823 --> 33:45.957
and we'd assume he simply got a bad fix.

33:46.025 --> 33:47.425
Oh, that is very clever.

33:47.493 --> 33:48.526
Except you didn't realize

33:48.594 --> 33:49.494
that Junior changed while he was away.

33:49.562 --> 33:50.662
He stopped eating meat.

33:50.729 --> 33:53.231
LUCIFER: Which is why his
father ate his food,

33:53.299 --> 33:55.200
and you killed the man you love.

33:55.267 --> 33:57.635
Ooh, a cruel twist of fate.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.437
You don't know what
you're talking about.

33:59.505 --> 34:00.672
So when we test
that powder in your hand,

34:00.739 --> 34:01.673
you're telling me it's not gonna match

34:01.740 --> 34:02.941
the poison that killed Javier?

34:03.008 --> 34:06.377
That ungrateful kid did
not deserve this place.

34:06.445 --> 34:09.414
He was given everything,
and he threw it all away.

34:09.482 --> 34:12.217
But it didn't matter.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.953
'Cause he was still the favorite.

34:15.020 --> 34:17.956
Because he was
worthy of his father's love.

34:18.023 --> 34:20.525
And he had a chance at redemption
until you ruined it.

34:32.103 --> 34:33.137
Are you okay?

34:33.204 --> 34:35.672
This place can't possibly be up to code.

34:35.739 --> 34:38.042
We've got to get out of here.

34:38.109 --> 34:39.909
Damn it, there's nowhere to go.

34:41.813 --> 34:44.947
Oh, no, no, no, no, this
is not how it goes down,

34:45.016 --> 34:47.051
not by a long shot, Dad.

34:47.118 --> 34:49.286
Lucifer, if you have any ideas...

34:50.522 --> 34:52.022
now's the time.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.831
CHLOE: You can put me down.

35:00.899 --> 35:02.266
LUCIFER: Right.

35:02.333 --> 35:03.667
Happy now?

35:08.473 --> 35:10.207
(Lucifer scoffs)

35:10.275 --> 35:12.209
The Devil gets burned by fire.

35:12.277 --> 35:13.977
Could this be any more ironic?

35:14.045 --> 35:15.746
- (chuckles)
- Ah.

35:15.814 --> 35:17.848
Does my pain amuse you, Detective?

35:17.916 --> 35:19.383
A little bit.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.984
And so does this.

35:21.052 --> 35:23.987
(laughs)

35:24.055 --> 35:25.989
You little rascal.

35:27.358 --> 35:29.493
(indistinct radio transmission)

35:32.497 --> 35:34.431
LUCIFER: Nice and tight.

35:34.499 --> 35:36.366
Ah. Oh, thank you.

35:38.036 --> 35:40.237
Anne was arrested a few blocks away,

35:40.305 --> 35:43.741
so she'll be eating prison
slop for a long time to come.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.943
Ah, her own personal hell indeed.

35:48.713 --> 35:52.616
Thank you. For getting me out.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.852
Well, couldn't exactly
rush out of there alone.

35:54.919 --> 35:56.320
How would that look? (chuckles)

35:56.387 --> 35:58.822
That's it?

35:59.657 --> 36:02.192
No "thanks for saving me first"?

36:02.260 --> 36:05.629
Is that what happened?

36:05.697 --> 36:07.598
It's funny, it's all so fuzzy now.

36:07.665 --> 36:09.800
Must be the third-degree burns.

36:09.868 --> 36:11.535
(chuckles)

36:13.404 --> 36:14.872
Can't believe it's gone.

36:14.939 --> 36:18.509
We found out what your
dad never got to tell you.

36:19.811 --> 36:22.412
He was gonna leave you the
restaurant all along.

36:23.581 --> 36:24.515
If you even want it.

36:24.582 --> 36:27.785
I think I do.

36:27.852 --> 36:30.988
And maybe I could rebuild it.

36:31.055 --> 36:32.556
You know, make it my own.

36:35.293 --> 36:36.493
(knocking at door)

36:36.561 --> 36:38.796
Uh, hang on, just a second.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.197
Maze.

36:40.265 --> 36:43.433
I'm surprised you came back.

36:43.501 --> 36:44.434
I made a friend today.

36:44.502 --> 36:47.171
That's fantastic news.

36:47.238 --> 36:48.438
Who?

36:48.506 --> 36:51.108
An eight-year-old girl who
wandered into the bar.

36:51.176 --> 36:53.844
Well...

36:53.912 --> 36:55.913
That's a start.

36:55.980 --> 36:58.182
Perhaps the next one can
be of legal drinking age.

36:58.249 --> 37:01.885
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

37:01.953 --> 37:03.487
Yeah.

37:03.555 --> 37:06.590
So are you... busy tonight?

37:08.426 --> 37:11.328
♪ Now I don't even know ♪

37:11.396 --> 37:14.431
♪ Oh, I don't even know... ♪

37:14.499 --> 37:16.500
What happened to you?

37:16.568 --> 37:19.036
Oh, it's, uh...

37:19.103 --> 37:21.939
it's been kind of a rough night.

37:22.006 --> 37:24.708
So I could use a drink.

37:24.776 --> 37:25.976
Here.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.254
What are you... what are you doing up?

37:37.322 --> 37:39.489
I have an early flight.

37:39.557 --> 37:41.992
And I didn't want to
leave without saying good-bye.

37:42.060 --> 37:45.295
But you just got home.

37:45.363 --> 37:48.332
Look, I know

37:48.399 --> 37:51.335
I haven't always been the easiest mom.

37:52.837 --> 37:54.805
I could be pushy.

37:54.873 --> 37:56.940
Overbearing.

37:57.008 --> 37:58.609
I am sorry

37:58.676 --> 38:01.845
that you felt that you always
had to be the adult.

38:01.913 --> 38:07.050
All I ever wanted
was for you to be happy.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.919
I know.

38:08.987 --> 38:13.957
And sometimes I think you
could just take a leap.

38:15.994 --> 38:16.860
Hmm.

38:16.928 --> 38:19.396
(chuckles)

38:19.464 --> 38:20.964

38:43.554 --> 38:45.756
What's up, partner?

38:45.823 --> 38:47.891
It's awfully late to
be calling a meet, huh?

38:47.959 --> 38:50.427
You were right.

38:50.495 --> 38:53.430
Lucifer Morningstar is
insane and dangerous.

38:53.498 --> 38:55.332
And he deserves everything he gets.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.334
Well, that works out perfectly.

38:57.402 --> 38:59.336
(chuckles)

39:04.175 --> 39:05.876
But I can't let you kill him.

39:08.246 --> 39:10.047
Come on, man.

39:10.114 --> 39:12.182
I mean, we talked about this.

39:12.250 --> 39:15.919
You know, I go down, you go down.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.387
Then I go down.

39:17.455 --> 39:19.289
It's too bad.

39:20.658 --> 39:21.858
(handcuffs clicking) I mean,

39:21.926 --> 39:25.028
I thought we had
something really special going.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.767
Go to hell. Come on.

40:10.108 --> 40:11.041
There you go.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.579
(phone chimes)

40:32.063 --> 40:33.430
Don't worry.

40:33.498 --> 40:35.899

Detective?

40:48.579 --> 40:51.381
This is unexpected.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.917
You said the door's always open,

40:53.985 --> 40:56.253
and I'm walking through it.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.721
Mmm.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.157
Right, well, I was just on my
way out to meet the Brittanys,

41:00.224 --> 41:03.827
but... I suppose
they can occupy each other.

41:03.895 --> 41:06.129
Great.

41:06.197 --> 41:07.531
Then have a seat.

41:07.598 --> 41:09.332
Yes. Has something happened...

41:09.400 --> 41:12.736
I'm guessing by the
looks of it... with Dan perhaps?

41:12.804 --> 41:13.503
Mmm.

41:13.571 --> 41:15.272
You mean Detective Douche?

41:15.339 --> 41:18.083
(laughs) Yes, well, of
course that's what I mean,

41:18.197 --> 41:19.953
but the bigger question
here is: why do you mean that?

41:19.954 --> 41:21.645
We weren't even back together,

41:21.712 --> 41:24.114
and he ended it with me tonight.

41:24.182 --> 41:25.649
With a text.

41:25.716 --> 41:27.717
I mean, what, are we in high school?

41:27.785 --> 41:30.454
Well, we're
certainly drinking like we are.

41:30.521 --> 41:33.223
Why don't you have a seat over here

41:33.291 --> 41:35.325
and tell me all about it, hmm?

41:35.393 --> 41:37.160
I just feel like an idiot.

41:37.228 --> 41:40.797
I can't believe that I would
let myself care for him again.

41:40.865 --> 41:42.332
I mean, why?

41:42.400 --> 41:43.667
So I get hurt?

41:43.734 --> 41:45.936
Um, no, because you're a kind person

41:46.003 --> 41:48.405
who puts the needs of
others before your own.

41:48.473 --> 41:51.608
It's a horrible irony that
my father invented.

41:51.676 --> 41:53.343
But you don't do that.

41:53.411 --> 41:55.145
You just take what you want.

41:55.213 --> 41:57.881
Since the beginning of time.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.416
That's nice.

41:59.484 --> 42:01.618
(both chuckle)

42:04.889 --> 42:06.556
Uh...

42:10.094 --> 42:11.294
What's happening?

42:11.362 --> 42:14.898
It would seem that I'm saying no.

42:14.966 --> 42:18.368
But you've been trying to get
me into bed since day one.

42:18.436 --> 42:19.903
Why are you saying no?

42:19.971 --> 42:21.931
Well, frankly, my dear, I'm
as baffled as you are.

42:21.973 --> 42:23.507
I mean, usually I'd leap at the chance

42:23.574 --> 42:25.375
to fulfill my carnal desire, but...

42:25.443 --> 42:29.980
(sighs) for some reason, I can't.

42:30.047 --> 42:31.448
What am I doing?

42:31.516 --> 42:33.450
Why am I here, drunk,
throwing myself at you?

42:33.518 --> 42:35.185
This is so sad.

42:35.253 --> 42:36.953
Well, it happens to the best, I promise.

42:37.021 --> 42:38.955
But not to me.

42:39.023 --> 42:41.958
I don't do this.

42:42.026 --> 42:45.962
This is something...

42:46.030 --> 42:47.931
my mom would do.

42:47.999 --> 42:50.333
(chuckles) That's who'd do it.

42:52.470 --> 42:54.337
Come here.

42:57.008 --> 43:00.410
We don't all turn into
our parents, Detective.

43:00.478 --> 43:02.212
(laughing) I mean, look at me.

43:02.280 --> 43:05.415

son that He wants me to be.
