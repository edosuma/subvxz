01:00.600 --> 01:02.489
The more jobs we do with these guys...

01:03.640 --> 01:05.940
The more they squeeze us.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.420
Fucking Russians.

01:07.520 --> 01:10.540
Well, Vassili kept things tight,
at least you knew where you were.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.165
But this bitch...

01:13.400 --> 01:14.420
I don't know.

01:14.520 --> 01:16.010
Man, no shit.

01:16.680 --> 01:19.081
I can almost feel her
breathing down our necks.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.729
I'll tell you what though, man.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.283
This job, it's keeping her up nights.

01:28.440 --> 01:31.205
Yeah. Well, the less we know, the better.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.005
All right, so what we're talking about,
we're gonna need more bodies.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.567
Franco and Marcus?

01:38.680 --> 01:39.900
That's our move?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.729
Well, we could do it ourselves, but...

01:42.680 --> 01:44.460
Inside three minutes?

01:44.560 --> 01:46.020
No, it's not possible.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.441
Job needs to be done in broad daylight.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.600
That means civilians, that means terrain.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.246
We need them.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.087
Don't worry.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.643
I trained with Marcus.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.969
Ah, shit. Fuck.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.620
Hey, watch the leather, man.

02:04.720 --> 02:05.980
Yeah.

02:06.080 --> 02:12.007
So, yeah, these guys,
they can handle themselves. Trust me.

02:12.560 --> 02:16.020
I'm telling you, Mike.
Me and Marcus go way back.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.770
It ain't Marcus I'm worried about.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.460
All right.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.289
We go in two weeks.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.580
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

03:27.680 --> 03:30.460
I just don't get how you can love
a dog more than a chick is all.

03:30.560 --> 03:33.540
Well, you got a girlfriend,
now you can talk about women, huh?

03:33.640 --> 03:36.805
Hey, Russell, where did you say your
brother met that girlfriend he has now,

03:36.920 --> 03:37.860
the one he's in love with?

03:37.960 --> 03:38.961
All right.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.165
I need you all to
tighten it up for me now.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.810
Hey, you heard him.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.331
- Tighten it up.
- All right.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.922
You better be right about this, Mike.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.780
"One day, the czar's
gardener came to report

03:59.880 --> 04:02.884
"that someone had been stealing
the fruits from the garden.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.060
"Determined to catch the thief...

04:05.160 --> 04:07.162
"...the czar ordered his three sons

04:07.280 --> 04:10.807
"to watch his precious
garden through the night."

04:38.120 --> 04:40.964
"Elizabeth was loved by everyone in town."

04:54.760 --> 04:56.603
Let's make this one for the books, huh?

04:59.080 --> 05:00.730
Here's some paperwork to get it done.

05:13.560 --> 05:14.686
Check them!

05:16.920 --> 05:19.764
Radio check. Check, check. One, two.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.286
We're good.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.606
- We good?
- Yeah.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.607
Down! Everybody down!

06:04.080 --> 06:05.127
Everybody down!

06:15.240 --> 06:16.287
Franco, guy on your left.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.649
What the hell do you think you're doing?

06:36.160 --> 06:38.260
Advise if responding, robbery in progress.

06:38.360 --> 06:39.566
First City National...

06:40.240 --> 06:41.651
Mike, call just went out.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.322
Stand by for responder ETAs.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.100
Hands out where I can see them, cabrÃ³n!

06:49.200 --> 06:50.531
You too!

06:51.320 --> 06:52.321
Come on, put your hands out.

07:07.400 --> 07:08.526
Face on the floor!

07:10.840 --> 07:11.887
Don't move!

07:16.000 --> 07:17.047
Open your mouth.

07:17.160 --> 07:19.401
All right, 512 and 11 responding.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.682
Three en route.
They're getting close, Mike.

07:21.840 --> 07:22.841
Two and a half minutes.

07:45.520 --> 07:46.885
Open it.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.610
ETA is one minute, Mike.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.603
Response is coming from the south.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.962
Working on a game plan. One sec.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.820
I'm on it!

08:37.919 --> 08:39.409
Don't move!

08:58.280 --> 08:59.860
Everybody in the vault!

09:04.120 --> 09:08.420
Gabe, remember, north on Hill
and east on Ninth.

09:10.120 --> 09:12.009
Copy. North on Hill and east on Ninth.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.361
Go!

09:19.800 --> 09:20.847
Yeah!

09:24.160 --> 09:25.400
That's what I'm talking about!

09:29.480 --> 09:30.641
Yeah!

09:30.760 --> 09:32.808
Okay, you're approaching an intersection.

09:33.160 --> 09:35.208
You've got a window. Take it.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.840
Here. Right here.

09:45.680 --> 09:46.620
Fuck!

09:46.720 --> 09:48.484
Shit. Shit.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.449
Gabe, you're gonna take
the highway entrance ahead.

09:56.800 --> 09:57.847
What the fuck?

09:59.560 --> 10:01.100
Do not let him decelerate, Mike.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.725
Do not let him decelerate.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.080
Take this oncoming lane.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.089
I can't see shit! What fucking lane?

10:06.200 --> 10:07.201
Now!

10:07.320 --> 10:08.260
What the fuck?

10:08.360 --> 10:10.806
No way, no fucking way. I can't get it.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.680
Whoa!

10:22.080 --> 10:23.081
Oh, oh, fuck!

10:27.400 --> 10:28.447
Oh, shit.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.403
I'm cut off behind the collision, Mike.

10:30.520 --> 10:31.860
You're on your own.

10:42.880 --> 10:45.281
Franco, make some noise.
Keep these people back.

10:53.760 --> 10:54.761
Fuck.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.122
Gabe, let's move. Get the box!

11:03.240 --> 11:05.083
- Come on!
- Fuck!

11:16.640 --> 11:18.540
Franco, you've made your point.
Stand down.

11:18.640 --> 11:19.766
Let's go!

11:21.920 --> 11:23.763
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

11:24.760 --> 11:25.761
Shit.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.740
Goddamn stupid bullshit!

12:24.840 --> 12:26.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
like I was planning that shit!

12:26.320 --> 12:28.049
God damn it, Gabe,
you still a fucking amateur.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.161
What the fuck!

12:29.280 --> 12:30.220
Shut up!

12:30.320 --> 12:31.900
The fuck you thinking
you greedy piece of shit?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.048
They put the bait in there
for dumb fucks like you!

12:34.160 --> 12:35.220
Marcus! Put your shit in the trunk, man.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.481
Fuck!

12:38.520 --> 12:40.363
- Bitch!
- Three days.

12:40.480 --> 12:41.845
Unless you hear from me different.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.460
Yeah, you know what? It was a gamble!

12:44.560 --> 12:47.100
But you'd all be blowing me right now
if that shit hadn't been rigged.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.531
- Fuck you!
- And you know it!

12:48.960 --> 12:50.460
Is this a game?

12:50.560 --> 12:52.562
Yo, put it away, Franco.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.050
Franco, man.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.721
You ever point a gun at me again,
you'd be a fool not to use it.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.245
You understand me?

13:01.360 --> 13:03.010
- Copy that.
- Copy that shit.

13:08.480 --> 13:11.086
Go catch some bad guys, detectives.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.565
You pull that shit out there,
what you think's going to happen?

13:49.680 --> 13:50.660
Huh?

13:50.760 --> 13:52.340
What the fuck you think
is going to happen to you?

13:52.440 --> 13:53.646
What?

13:54.280 --> 13:56.328
Can't you see what I'm trying to do here?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.820
- Get off me.
- I ain't gonna get off you, little brother,

14:01.920 --> 14:04.082
because you're going to
end up fucking dead.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.980
You didn't see the same shit
me and Marcus seen.

14:09.160 --> 14:11.128
Fuck, what? Navy SEAL shit again?

14:11.520 --> 14:13.284
Huh?

14:17.040 --> 14:18.530
Mike is pissed.

14:19.160 --> 14:20.764
But Mike's still Mike.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.540
These other two, Marcus and Franco...

14:24.640 --> 14:25.641
Hey.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.442
Do we have to worry about them?

14:31.200 --> 14:33.020
Cops look after cops.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.282
Same as you Special Ops do.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.011
It's fine.

14:40.520 --> 14:41.646
All right.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.807
All right?

14:46.120 --> 14:48.441
Gabe's been clean for six months.

14:48.840 --> 14:50.340
He's trying.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.124
He was a good cop.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.330
Look, I know you give a fuck.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.321
We're family, man. We're family.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.401
God and righteousness will prevail.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.363
Death to the ways of the devil.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.531
All will prevail.

16:04.680 --> 16:07.860
Goodness will prevail.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.460
White devil establishes himself by rape!

16:10.560 --> 16:11.580
That's right.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.365
Murder! Robbing people!

16:15.080 --> 16:16.260
God hates the white devil.

16:16.360 --> 16:17.340
True, brother!

16:17.440 --> 16:19.124
He's the illegal immigrant.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.210
You, sir!

16:21.840 --> 16:25.580
You have the sign of the beast around
your neck like a hangman's noose.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.300
God and righteousness will prevail.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.562
The original man will rise.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.168
He will rise again!

16:33.320 --> 16:34.340
Death to the ways of the devil.

16:34.440 --> 16:35.885
Detective Allen.

16:37.320 --> 16:40.051
Goodness will preval.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.164
Well, they fired a warning shot.

16:44.440 --> 16:46.283
Uh, 12-gauge tactical round.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.060
Run it.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.606
Yeah, we're dealing
with a crash-and-bash, four-man team.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.500
We're pulling surveillance now.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.980
The dye pack destroyed
most of what they took in cash.

16:56.080 --> 16:59.289
But their focus was on
a security deposit box.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.420
Yeah.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.443
- Belonging to who?
- It belonged to

17:02.560 --> 17:04.847
a wealthy Russian named Dimitrije Petkov.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.859
Family claims they have no idea
why he would keep a box here.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.940
That's Walter Sims,
the bank manager right there.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.180
Get me that report.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.520
Walter.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.568
Detective Allen. First time being robbed?

17:15.680 --> 17:16.740
No fun, right?

17:16.839 --> 17:18.380
They've got pictures of my family.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.859
My daughters. Where we live.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.060
My daughters' school.

17:21.160 --> 17:22.339
Walter, you're a bank manager.

17:22.440 --> 17:26.260
You should be smart enough to know
that the monster has gone digital.

17:26.359 --> 17:29.700
Be careful what you
insta-google-tweet-face.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.131
Fucking sons of bitches.

17:31.320 --> 17:32.970
Hey, hey, Walter.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.004
Give 'em hell, baby.

17:53.560 --> 17:54.800
Bye, Daddy.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.660
Everybody, listen the fuck up!

18:09.760 --> 18:12.580
I just found out Captain is still waiting

18:12.680 --> 18:15.445
on a current gang initiation
report from some of you.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.001
- Smith.
- Mmm.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.641
Uh, same as always, Sarge. Um...

18:20.280 --> 18:23.602
They get in a circle and they
kick the shit out of each other.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.420
And then they hug it out.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.568
- Just get it done.
- Sorry, Sarge.

18:29.640 --> 18:32.689
Also, First City downtown
got held up this morning.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.046
Apparently, they were heavily
armed and spoke Spanish,

18:36.160 --> 18:38.900
which narrows it down to just
under a quarter of the city.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.526
Uh, I resent the racial implications
of that remark there, Sarge.

18:41.640 --> 18:43.060
And they all live in your one-room duplex,

18:43.160 --> 18:44.366
so they shouldn't be too hard to find.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.260
Call Marcus's mom. She's at my place.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.020
Ooh!

18:48.120 --> 18:50.043
Make calls, check with our people.

18:50.160 --> 18:53.780
Jeffrey Allen from Major Crimes
will be heading up the investigation.

18:53.880 --> 18:57.020
Speaking of, allow me
to introduce his nephew, Chris.

18:57.120 --> 18:58.700
Where'd you come from again?

18:58.800 --> 19:00.540
Zone Two. Uh, FIT Unit.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.260
Mongrel territory.

19:02.360 --> 19:03.771
Crossing guard.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.460
Two, huh?

19:06.560 --> 19:08.483
Belmont. Pair up with Allen.

19:08.720 --> 19:09.780
Come on, man.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.620
Maybe he can get you
to come to work on time.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.245
Are you serious?

19:13.360 --> 19:17.161
Now remember, first to find
a gun out there gets the day off.

19:17.920 --> 19:18.940
That's all I've got.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.060
Hey, Sarge, can we talk about this?

19:20.160 --> 19:21.400
Hell no.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.090
Get the fuck out of the way, man.

19:43.240 --> 19:45.004
We looking for anything in particular?

19:46.280 --> 19:47.520
Always.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.041
Hey, Shanice, come on down from there now.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.844
Hey, Snap, baby!

20:07.080 --> 20:08.286
You're in trouble now.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.180
Look, I was minding my own
till these motherfuckers showed up.

20:11.280 --> 20:13.860
- Come on down from there.
- I'm just having me a good time.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.962
Come your ass down!

20:17.080 --> 20:18.060
Damn.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.491
How the fuck you got up there?

20:19.960 --> 20:21.380
All right, come on over here, boys.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.860
Come on, man.
Y'all go over there and help.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.540
You better not be watching
my motherfucking ass.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.140
Sources are saying
the brazen robbery may have ties

20:28.240 --> 20:30.380
to cartels and even the Russian mafia.

20:30.480 --> 20:34.007
With more on this, our crime
correspondent, William Moran.

20:34.120 --> 20:38.331
Thought to control 70% of the Russian
economy, the Russian mafia is the...

20:40.400 --> 20:41.401
Huh.

20:42.960 --> 20:46.089
Yeah, listen, uh...
I'm going to call you back.

20:46.480 --> 20:47.845
Yeah, thanks.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.220
How's work? Anything from Marcus?

20:52.320 --> 20:53.845
Quiet as a mother's prayer.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.327
Good. I'll see you guys in two days.

20:57.520 --> 21:00.340
A senior State Department
official was quoted as saying,

21:00.440 --> 21:02.500
"There is not a major Russian organized

21:02.600 --> 21:04.580
"crime figure that we are tracking

21:04.680 --> 21:06.967
"who does not carry an Israeli passport."

21:21.880 --> 21:22.881
Come.

21:24.040 --> 21:26.008
You know how this works.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.567
Take it easy, man. The safety's off.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.046
Oh!

21:38.480 --> 21:39.460
Hello, little man!

21:39.560 --> 21:40.540
Daddy!

21:40.640 --> 21:41.940
How are you doing? All right?

21:42.040 --> 21:45.123
I missed you.

21:45.240 --> 21:48.881
There really is no love quite like
a father's love for his son, no?

21:49.520 --> 21:50.521
Come.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.980
So, you know, Michael,

21:55.080 --> 21:58.220
Vassili will be calling.
We are grateful for your work,

21:58.320 --> 22:01.140
but in this case,
we need to withhold payment.

22:01.240 --> 22:03.208
- There is a second job.
- No!

22:04.480 --> 22:06.642
We done the job. Pay the fucking money!

22:06.760 --> 22:08.220
Mmm.

22:08.320 --> 22:09.560
My sister...

22:09.720 --> 22:13.088
My sister always went for stupid men.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.925
Why? I do not know.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.570
Perhaps it is that my sister,
too, is stupid.

22:20.080 --> 22:22.765
A terrible thing for
a sibling to say, I know.

22:23.400 --> 22:27.340
But she is a great beauty, yes,
which goes a long way in this world,

22:27.440 --> 22:30.091
but look in the eyes and you will see it.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.660
A great yawning stupidity

22:32.760 --> 22:35.491
and a complete and utter
lack of judgment in men.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.340
But love...

22:39.440 --> 22:41.761
Love makes great demands of us all. Hmm?

22:42.840 --> 22:43.921
What do you want?

22:44.280 --> 22:46.282
He's going to be calling again.

22:48.560 --> 22:49.971
Hello, Michael.

22:50.920 --> 22:52.046
Elena.

22:53.760 --> 22:56.889
What's going on here, Irina?
The fucking feds?

22:57.960 --> 22:59.564
What the fuck are you in?

22:59.840 --> 23:00.966
Thank you, Elena.

23:07.080 --> 23:09.128
Yes, I have just been speaking to Michael.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.322
Mmm-hmm, I was just about
to discuss that with him.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.164
This wasn't the fucking deal.

23:16.480 --> 23:19.643
Michael is still resistant
about the second job.

23:22.640 --> 23:23.721
I know this.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.380
The FBI have traced the files.

23:30.480 --> 23:33.484
They are in the possession
of Homeland Security.

23:47.680 --> 23:48.841
Of course not.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.340
Yo, man. We got a problem.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.851
What's that? Irina?

24:01.960 --> 24:03.260
Yeah.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.100
Yeah, we need to meet now. All of us.

24:06.200 --> 24:07.690
They're fucking with us, man.

24:07.840 --> 24:09.580
There's another job they want us to do.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.940
Just ain't no dealing with these people.

24:12.040 --> 24:15.340
Man, we should have cut
those ties years ago, after Iraq.

24:15.440 --> 24:17.408
Guess it's not so clean
when you got a kid in the mix.

24:17.960 --> 24:19.860
I'll call your brother. See you in a few.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.291
Yeah, all right.

24:43.040 --> 24:45.180
...and she's like, "Give me a kiss,
give me a kiss, Daddy."

24:45.280 --> 24:47.380
And I'm like, "Whoa, baby,
look, you're an informant.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.020
"That is against police protocol."

24:49.120 --> 24:51.851
Strictly speaking,
you shouldn't even be sucking my dick.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.300
- Yo.
- What are we doing here, Mike?

24:54.400 --> 24:56.380
- Where's Russell at?
- I don't know, he's your boy.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.084
Put a GPS on his ass.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.089
Yo, Gabe. Where your brother, man?

25:00.680 --> 25:03.251
Don't ask me. He's a no-show.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.220
What are we doing here?

25:05.320 --> 25:06.540
She ain't paying.

25:06.640 --> 25:07.820
Bullshit.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.140
There's another job.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.446
The fuck you talking about?

25:10.560 --> 25:12.820
She says it's worth three mil
on top of what she owes.

25:12.920 --> 25:16.083
Oh. Of course she did.
She didn't pay now, why the fuck pay later?

25:16.240 --> 25:18.368
Bullshit, she's playing you.

25:18.920 --> 25:21.420
- She got what she wanted, right?
- What?

25:21.520 --> 25:22.740
She got what she wanted!

25:22.840 --> 25:24.180
The fuck I got to deal
with this bitch, huh?

25:24.280 --> 25:25.850
You're the one who got us
hooked up with this bullshit.

25:25.960 --> 25:27.020
This come from your end.

25:27.120 --> 25:28.180
- You deal with it.
- Uh-huh.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.520
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:30.120 --> 25:32.180
You two are really in it now, Franco.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.460
How you figure?

25:33.560 --> 25:34.925
She got the feds in her pocket, baby.

25:37.240 --> 25:39.340
- Yeah.
- Feds?

25:39.440 --> 25:42.380
I've seen them. They're all
up in there, one big happy family.

25:42.480 --> 25:44.180
And I ain't got to
remind either one of you

25:44.280 --> 25:46.726
how much the feds love dirty fucking cops.

25:53.040 --> 25:54.963
Look who decided to show up.

26:07.280 --> 26:08.486
Check the side!

26:14.920 --> 26:16.285
Russell!

26:16.400 --> 26:18.323
- Back up! Back up!
- Get it off! Get it off!

26:18.840 --> 26:19.940
Get him out of here!

26:20.040 --> 26:21.166
Get off me!

26:22.160 --> 26:24.140
Get him out, Michael.
Come on. Get him out.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.004
No, his hands are tied. I can't get him.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.685
Get him out the car, Mike.

26:28.680 --> 26:29.681
All right.

26:32.280 --> 26:33.327
Oh, shit!

26:44.960 --> 26:46.371
How's it look?

26:46.920 --> 26:48.160
It ain't good, man.

26:52.840 --> 26:54.365
He ain't gonna make it.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.040
Russell.

27:06.360 --> 27:07.885
I'm going to take care of you now.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.161
Go on.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.529
Don't look at it.

27:49.600 --> 27:50.681
Fuck!

27:56.760 --> 27:57.761
Oh.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.764
It's Michael again.

28:01.600 --> 28:02.601
I know.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.526
You know?

28:08.720 --> 28:09.767
Here.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.523
He's not calling for me.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.484
I'm going to bed.

28:39.160 --> 28:41.288
My, what big teeth you've got.

28:42.800 --> 28:46.700
Some guy used this in a robbery
a couple nights ago.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.165
Ingenious.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.482
Hit the lights, panda bear.

28:51.880 --> 28:55.220
So, we agree the whole
Spanish-speaking thing is bullshit.

28:55.320 --> 28:57.448
No way these guys are Cartel.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.921
Tell me if you notice anything.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.325
Well, this isn't street.

29:05.920 --> 29:08.161
These guys have had tactical training.

29:08.640 --> 29:11.325
Some of these guys are military for sure.

29:19.640 --> 29:23.361
The czarina, what's she after?

29:24.000 --> 29:25.001
Psst.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.364
She ain't said yet.

29:29.320 --> 29:32.642
Whatever it is, it's in an unmarked
Homeland Security building.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.851
DHS uses it as a weigh station
for sensitive materials

29:37.000 --> 29:38.684
coming in and out of the country.

29:39.200 --> 29:40.220
How many guards?

29:40.320 --> 29:41.321
Unknown.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.689
Unknown. Probably a lot.

29:44.040 --> 29:46.008
Definitely some private tactical teams.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.260
Some kind of rent-a-SWAT.

29:48.360 --> 29:50.220
So what are we talking?
Four maybe five minutes tops?

29:50.320 --> 29:51.731
No, man. No.

29:52.880 --> 29:54.211
We're looking at 10.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.166
Uh, yeah, that can't be done.

29:57.720 --> 30:00.121
Response would be on us in three minutes.

30:02.680 --> 30:05.889
Well, they'll kill every last one
of us, we don't get this thing.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.642
We could pull a 999.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.331
That's not such a bad idea.

30:21.160 --> 30:22.730
That'd buy you 10 minutes.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.243
- Oh, my God.
- Twenty minutes.

30:26.360 --> 30:27.850
You're kidding.

30:28.400 --> 30:29.740
Tell me you're fucking joking!

30:29.840 --> 30:31.126
Yo, yo, yo, yo. Enough of this cop shit.

30:31.520 --> 30:32.660
English.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.728
999? The fuck is that?

30:46.840 --> 30:48.251
Jesus Christ.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.445
You gotta fuckin' love this job.

30:52.760 --> 30:55.445
Hey, try not to get
a stain on your shitty suit.

30:56.120 --> 30:58.340
I'm not worried. I've got two.

31:00.240 --> 31:02.322
Looks like the Lae Me
sent us a kite from prison.

31:02.440 --> 31:04.420
Looks that way.

31:04.520 --> 31:06.488
Hey, genius,
can one of y'all turn that off?

31:06.960 --> 31:08.041
Fuck.

31:08.600 --> 31:12.286
Chris, this is Sergeant
Franco Rodriguez. Detective.

31:12.520 --> 31:13.851
Detective, that's Chris.

31:14.280 --> 31:15.645
Homicide.

31:16.280 --> 31:19.204
This is my new partner.
Got called up from "Zone Two."

31:20.080 --> 31:22.970
So what does working in Zone Two
tell you about all this?

31:24.400 --> 31:27.483
Uh, I don't know. Let's see.

31:32.400 --> 31:34.402
Which means loose lips sink ships.

31:35.640 --> 31:37.085
In American.

31:38.480 --> 31:39.481
Right?

31:40.400 --> 31:41.900
Something like that?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.540
Okay, I'm going to go look for a witness.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.768
Nice to meet you, Rodriguez.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.331
Any familiar faces?

31:52.320 --> 31:55.005
Well, not these two losers,
but this right here

31:55.120 --> 31:56.849
is Pedro Marquez.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.620
Affiliated?

31:58.720 --> 31:59.960
Locos o Trece.

32:00.480 --> 32:01.641
Next county over.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.820
But I don't know why the fuck
they'd be over here, man.

32:03.920 --> 32:05.365
Probably looking for their bodies.

32:07.520 --> 32:10.485
- Hey, Ed you talk to these guys yet?
- Not yet.

32:11.640 --> 32:13.369
What's going on, guys?

32:14.840 --> 32:16.683
Y'all been out here a while?

32:18.440 --> 32:21.020
Hey, I'm just going to ask you
some questions, man.

32:21.120 --> 32:22.580
You don't have to square up on me.

32:22.680 --> 32:25.889
You come over here and blame us
for them fools, huh, puto?

32:26.600 --> 32:27.580
I didn't say that.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.205
That's exactly what
you said, motherfucker.

32:29.360 --> 32:32.887
I didn't. I'm just trying to find out
if somebody saw something.

32:33.440 --> 32:34.885
Fuck you, jura.

32:35.720 --> 32:36.780
- All right.
- Tell you what,

32:36.880 --> 32:39.565
I'll get balls deep in your pink,
you fucking feel me?

32:47.040 --> 32:49.725
You, uh, want to take care
of your partner over there?

32:50.480 --> 32:51.561
Motherfucker.

32:53.560 --> 32:55.244
Them cuffs a little too tight.
You fucking punk bitch...

32:55.360 --> 32:56.805
Shut the hell up!

32:57.480 --> 32:58.580
Yo, Snaps. What's up
with your hyna here...

32:58.680 --> 32:59.700
Shut the hell up.

32:59.800 --> 33:00.780
Pinche mayate!

33:00.880 --> 33:03.565
Hey, didn't the cop tell you
to shut the fuck up? Listen!

33:03.680 --> 33:05.489
- Fuck you...
- Get him. Come with me.

33:06.240 --> 33:08.322
Back up. Back the fuck up!

33:09.040 --> 33:10.201
Come with me.

33:17.240 --> 33:19.846
Hey, homeboy. Hey, go get a cigarette.

33:22.040 --> 33:23.530
Come on, man.

33:24.360 --> 33:26.203
You're closed for five minutes.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.140
The fuck are you doing, man?

33:30.240 --> 33:31.500
I could ask you the same thing.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.900
I didn't throw a guy on the ground
and try to incite a fucking riot.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.286
He was running his mouth.
You didn't hear him.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.980
Running his mouth?
What, he hurt your feelings?

33:37.080 --> 33:39.100
It's the fucking streets,
that's what people do.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.420
You even know who that is?

33:40.520 --> 33:41.660
- That was obstruction.
- Oh.

33:41.760 --> 33:43.740
He was getting in the way
of my investigation.

33:43.840 --> 33:46.446
Get out of school, man.
There ain't no obstruction up here.

33:46.760 --> 33:50.082
That's Luis Pinto.
He's a Mara Salvatrucha lieutenant.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.448
You think somebody gonna talk now?

33:52.560 --> 33:53.686
- Oh, he's a lieutenant?
- Yeah.

33:53.800 --> 33:55.980
I didn't realize. Well, I'll just go
and apologize to him, then.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.700
This ain't a fucking game, Chris.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.220
The rules around here are different.

33:59.320 --> 34:00.940
This ain't Buckhead, all right?

34:01.040 --> 34:02.724
So you better learn fast.

34:03.600 --> 34:04.965
Hey, let me tell you something.

34:05.080 --> 34:07.020
You got a problem with me,
put it on the table,

34:07.120 --> 34:09.820
but don't pull me aside and question me
like you know something I don't know.

34:09.920 --> 34:12.860
You let an asshole like that bow up on you
in front of the whole neighborhood,

34:12.960 --> 34:15.007
you're the one who's got
some explaining to do.

34:15.800 --> 34:18.219
Now, get off my back and let me do my job.

34:18.320 --> 34:20.129
Oh, you know the whole game now, huh?

34:20.960 --> 34:22.768
Unlock the door, stupid.

34:29.320 --> 34:32.766
So what? We do this Triple 9,
we get 10 clear minutes?

34:34.600 --> 34:37.170
Kill a cop? You get all damn day.

34:38.400 --> 34:40.687
A 999 gets called in,

34:40.800 --> 34:43.380
all units in the area converge
on the downed officer.

34:43.480 --> 34:45.060
It's open-season.

34:45.159 --> 34:47.300
Everybody wants a piece of a cop killer.

34:47.400 --> 34:50.820
It's like pulling the plug
and the whole force going down the drain.

34:50.920 --> 34:53.525
And you're absolutely sure
that you can make this happen?

34:53.639 --> 34:54.766
Oh, yeah.

34:59.120 --> 35:00.281
All right.

35:02.360 --> 35:03.805
You the police.

35:04.640 --> 35:05.687
But you...

35:05.800 --> 35:08.490
You're gonna have to hard check
that fucking liability.

35:12.640 --> 35:14.881
Worry about the 999, Franco.

35:15.360 --> 35:16.691
I'm going to go bury my friend.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.201
His brother.

35:19.040 --> 35:21.361
Unless you want to help us dig a hole.

35:25.800 --> 35:28.041
Yeah, I didn't fucking think so.

35:33.520 --> 35:34.521
Yo.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.126
Yo, my man.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.847
Fucking come on, man.
Let's get out of here.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.140
You good?

35:44.680 --> 35:46.409
All right. Come on.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.929
I should have known better.

36:02.400 --> 36:05.060
There's got to be a different way.

36:05.160 --> 36:08.410
What, are you suddenly getting saintly
because this FNG wears a shield?

36:08.520 --> 36:10.249
There's a difference, Franco,
and you know it.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.085
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:12.200 --> 36:13.611
Bullshit.

36:13.720 --> 36:17.140
How many cop funerals have you been
to in the last five years, huh?

36:17.240 --> 36:20.724
And you tell yourself the same thing that
every cop sitting there tells himself.

36:21.400 --> 36:22.925
"Better him than me."

36:26.360 --> 36:28.931
If you're having
a problem with this, Marcus,

36:29.600 --> 36:31.340
I'll do it.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.761
I don't have a problem taking out a cop.

36:34.440 --> 36:36.442
I'll do a cop just like...

36:42.160 --> 36:44.288
Oh, ho, ho. A little to the right.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.540
- Let's reload. Don't let 'em know.
- Missed.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.642
What are you doing in there, Uncle Jeff?

36:52.760 --> 36:54.762
Nothing's happening over here.

36:55.240 --> 36:57.100
How's your job going?

36:57.200 --> 36:59.380
I don't know, it's going all right, man,

36:59.480 --> 37:01.562
but I would like to make a difference.

37:02.160 --> 37:04.340
I know how that sounds.
What are you laughing at?

37:04.440 --> 37:06.220
You're gonna make a difference.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.460
You ain't going to
make a fucking difference.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.324
Get that notion out of your head.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.500
You know what you need to do?

37:13.600 --> 37:16.620
Your job, keep your head on a swivel,

37:16.720 --> 37:21.002
out-monster the monster,
and get home at the end of the night.

37:21.520 --> 37:22.540
Uncle Jeff.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.380
- Can you do that?
- Are you kidding me?

37:24.480 --> 37:26.687
- No.
- You know what kind of spots I've been in?

37:26.800 --> 37:27.980
A lot hairier than this...

37:28.080 --> 37:30.447
- So don't worry about me.
- No. I am worried about you.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.844
You don't realize...

37:32.960 --> 37:37.682
Any one of these little fucking
snake-eyed motherfuckers,

37:38.360 --> 37:41.682
you know, could be strapped right now.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.843
I owe it to your mother.

37:46.320 --> 37:47.924
I owe it to her.

37:48.520 --> 37:51.285
Look, it... I can't look after you...

37:51.840 --> 37:53.524
Fuck these motherfuckers.

37:53.640 --> 37:55.020
Any one of these cock...

37:55.120 --> 37:56.167
Hey!

37:56.520 --> 37:57.500
Hey!

37:57.600 --> 38:00.420
Are any of you cocksuckers
strapped right now?

38:00.520 --> 38:01.500
- You?
- Jeff...

38:01.600 --> 38:02.940
You got a gun on you, huh?

38:03.040 --> 38:05.281
Jeff, hey. Sit down. Sit down.

38:13.560 --> 38:16.460
Hey, what does little Trevor
want for his birthday?

38:18.800 --> 38:21.280
Uh, he wants a gun.

38:23.680 --> 38:25.020
A gun?

38:25.120 --> 38:26.940
No. He wants a toy gun.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.326
Another toy gun.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.688
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

38:35.200 --> 38:36.804
How you doing, boy?

38:38.080 --> 38:39.460
- You good?
- Yeah.

38:39.560 --> 38:40.561
Okay.

38:41.560 --> 38:43.020
All right. Let's get this off you, man.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.531
Go on, sit down.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.568
There you go. There it is.

38:49.200 --> 38:52.124
Just sit there for a second
while I go speak to your mother.

38:54.840 --> 38:56.365
You fucking late.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.084
You're lucky you get to see him at all.

38:59.200 --> 39:00.770
I need to see your sister.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.660
Why the fuck ain't she answering my calls?

39:03.760 --> 39:07.260
Michael, I had to convince my sister
to spare you, okay?

39:07.360 --> 39:08.540
Have a little gratitude.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.005
You need to do this for me, okay?

39:10.240 --> 39:12.163
Or you need to get the fuck out.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.849
I'll see what I can do.

39:19.200 --> 39:20.725
Now, hurry, okay?

39:21.600 --> 39:23.409
I only have an hour.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.321
Felix, come here. Come here.

39:47.160 --> 39:50.004
No, no. You ain't gonna
do that in front of my son.

39:50.400 --> 39:52.164
Go on. Find your mother.

40:03.320 --> 40:05.049
Sit down, Michael.

40:05.160 --> 40:07.527
Have some tea. We have much to discuss.

40:07.640 --> 40:08.980
We do?

40:09.080 --> 40:10.127
What do you want to talk about?

40:10.880 --> 40:12.166
Do you want to talk about Russell?

40:12.440 --> 40:13.441
Hmm.

40:14.160 --> 40:15.300
Yes. That.

40:15.400 --> 40:18.802
You want to get this thing done,
you stay the fuck away from my crew!

40:23.920 --> 40:25.684
There you go, sweetie.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.846
Hmm, so now that all of
that is out of the way,

40:33.880 --> 40:36.850
Vassili would like to know
how things are progressing.

40:40.520 --> 40:42.602
Tell him we've got a way to make it work.

40:45.920 --> 40:48.048
This is fantastic news.

40:49.360 --> 40:50.407
Yes.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.620
You know, I think I'd prefer it

41:00.720 --> 41:02.484
if you just watched porn.

41:03.120 --> 41:04.610
I was about to.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.205
Oh, good.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.324
Are you sulking, baby?

41:11.280 --> 41:12.281
No.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.802
You look like you're sulking.

41:20.880 --> 41:25.090
Listen, you wanted this job, remember?

41:25.560 --> 41:26.686
We... Yea...

41:28.560 --> 41:32.246
That was before I knew that it came
with a fucking asshole of a partner.

41:33.600 --> 41:35.329
Come on, baby.

41:36.080 --> 41:38.242
You need to work with these guys.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.611
Since when does my tough guy

41:44.400 --> 41:46.607
let anyone get to him.

41:49.080 --> 41:50.764
Nobody got to me.

41:51.640 --> 41:54.610
Now, stop feeling so sorry for yourself.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.764
And come to bed.

42:20.640 --> 42:22.020
My partner is not a problem.

42:22.120 --> 42:23.540
Are you sure about that, man?

42:23.640 --> 42:25.529
Look, I don't give a fuck
about this guy, all right?

42:25.640 --> 42:28.740
He's perfect. The minute Jeffrey Allen
hears his nephew is down,

42:28.840 --> 42:30.860
he'll send every cop to the call.
Right, Franco?

42:30.960 --> 42:32.007
I've seen him.

42:32.360 --> 42:33.540
He's our guy.

42:33.640 --> 42:34.846
Look, I got a spot in mind.

42:34.960 --> 42:37.531
Those abandoned projects
over on Washington.

42:37.640 --> 42:38.721
All right.

42:43.960 --> 42:45.689
Sounds like it's settled.

43:00.680 --> 43:02.364
This guy's done nothing.

43:03.680 --> 43:07.162
Does he have a family? Do you even know?

43:09.920 --> 43:11.206
I don't care.

43:12.920 --> 43:16.209
If it comes down to us or some cop,
I'll be damned if it's not us who walk away

43:16.320 --> 43:18.049
from this thing, you understand?

43:20.200 --> 43:21.440
Say it, man.

43:21.920 --> 43:23.604
Say you understand.

43:28.840 --> 43:31.207
Russell would've found another way.

43:34.680 --> 43:37.889
Look, it's one more fucking job.

43:39.280 --> 43:41.203
Just another fucking job.

43:42.040 --> 43:45.968
If you in, get your shit
together right now.

43:46.440 --> 43:47.965
There must be...

43:52.080 --> 43:54.048
Don't do this, Mike.

43:56.720 --> 43:58.404
You got a better idea?

43:59.920 --> 44:00.921
You?

44:04.560 --> 44:06.608
Fucking look at yourself, man!

44:08.160 --> 44:11.060
Fucking look at... Fucking...

44:11.160 --> 44:13.083
Get the fuck out, man!

44:13.560 --> 44:15.244
Get the fuck out!

44:34.960 --> 44:36.962
Now this is the house, right here.

44:37.960 --> 44:40.008
That's our boy. Fat one on the porch.

44:44.280 --> 44:46.220
I'm going to talk to my source.

44:46.320 --> 44:50.129
You want to come with me, see if that great
police work you did yesterday paid off?

44:50.600 --> 44:52.364
- You're a riot.
- All right.

45:11.080 --> 45:12.081
Who are you?

45:13.640 --> 45:15.580
- Who are you?
- Don't tell him your name, homie.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.921
You that cop who busted up Luis
the other day?

45:18.720 --> 45:20.370
That was a misunderstanding.

45:20.800 --> 45:23.460
Like, why don't you go bother
some other homies, know what I'm saying?

45:23.560 --> 45:25.380
Why don't y'all go to school,
you know what I'm saying?

45:25.480 --> 45:27.220
Man, this homie's
getting homeschooled, bro.

45:27.320 --> 45:28.300
By who?

45:28.400 --> 45:29.380
By me. Teaching 'em mad skills, yo.

45:29.480 --> 45:31.528
For real? Well, I got a question for you.

45:33.160 --> 45:35.401
The Mara Salvatrucha sign,
where's it come from?

45:35.920 --> 45:36.980
It's from here.

45:37.080 --> 45:38.650
This is from here?

45:40.200 --> 45:41.690
Black Sabbath.

45:42.160 --> 45:44.003
Who the fuck is Black Sabbath?

45:44.120 --> 45:46.660
Hey, y'all rug rats don't go to school?

45:46.760 --> 45:48.683
Get out of here. Go to school, man.

45:50.320 --> 45:52.004
I will arrest your little ass.

46:05.280 --> 46:07.009
- Okay, stay on that.
- Okay.

46:07.360 --> 46:09.840
I got two or three more
sources to check in with.

46:10.400 --> 46:11.740
I'll call in later.

46:11.840 --> 46:13.300
Yeah. Oh, uh...

46:13.400 --> 46:16.620
Hey, someone named
Sweet Pea called you back.

46:16.720 --> 46:17.721
Okay.

46:23.600 --> 46:25.540
- Come on, girl.
- Hey, hey.

46:25.640 --> 46:28.166
Girl, do me a favor. Go and set the bar.
I need five minutes.

46:28.280 --> 46:30.100
- Girl, I got you.
- Thanks.

46:30.200 --> 46:31.247
Come here.

46:31.360 --> 46:32.620
You're looking good, Sweet Pea.

46:32.720 --> 46:34.449
Thank you, Daddy.

46:36.360 --> 46:37.700
What have you got for me?

46:37.800 --> 46:40.326
Child, I don't want no parts of this.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.731
I'm listening.

46:51.280 --> 46:52.540
Baby-doll.

46:52.640 --> 46:54.961
Mama will get killed if the tea gets out.

46:55.560 --> 46:58.964
So this shit here is going to cost you,
and I ain't talking shortbread.

46:59.480 --> 47:01.960
You gonna have to show me
a whole lot of coin.

47:08.240 --> 47:10.322
Five G's if it goes anywhere.

47:11.080 --> 47:14.641
All right, look. I'm going to tell you,
but this is it, Jeffrey.

47:14.760 --> 47:16.340
I mean, I'm working here now, okay?

47:16.440 --> 47:20.580
I'm doing what I do, so no more favors.

47:20.680 --> 47:21.841
Okay.

47:24.240 --> 47:25.446
Anyway.

47:27.080 --> 47:30.620
The other night, I heard some fucked-up
bitch talking to another girl

47:30.720 --> 47:32.700
about some creepy motherfucker,

47:32.800 --> 47:35.610
some fierce, scary shit
like out of a horror movie.

47:36.280 --> 47:40.260
Now, I only heard bits and pieces,
but this bitch kept going on and on

47:40.360 --> 47:43.964
about some dude covered in red dye
looking like the devil's dick.

47:44.880 --> 47:46.900
The bitch that was doing all the talking,

47:47.000 --> 47:50.607
she said that this man of hers
said that he robbed a bank,

47:50.720 --> 47:53.200
and, honey, all hell broke loose.

47:54.880 --> 47:59.249
Oh, now, the girl who told you this,
what was her name?

48:00.920 --> 48:02.604
She go by Leah.

48:03.160 --> 48:05.288
Some old working junkie bitch.

48:06.200 --> 48:10.007
She dance here off and on, and I see
her in the street from time to time.

48:19.120 --> 48:22.123
They don't have a baby.
They just got a stroller full of dope.

48:26.760 --> 48:27.860
He did good with that stroller.

48:27.960 --> 48:30.725
Kicked it, folded it up like a pro.

48:36.280 --> 48:37.281
Oh.

48:38.040 --> 48:40.202
Unit 406 to perimeter.
We're going to let the woman leave.

48:40.320 --> 48:42.420
Pick her up once she's out of the complex.

48:43.680 --> 48:46.160
Fernando Rivera, AKA Termite.

48:46.440 --> 48:48.900
Hitter for the Mexican Mafia,
fresh out the pen.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.340
Just did an eight-year
stretch for trafficking.

48:51.440 --> 48:53.727
His PO issued us a violation warrant

48:53.840 --> 48:56.780
so we can talk to him about
the severed heads last week.

48:56.880 --> 48:58.848
Let's see what he's got to say, boys.

49:05.560 --> 49:09.201
Barry, you're shield.
Smith, you're second. Gomez, breach.

49:09.680 --> 49:13.366
Second team. Jackson, shield.
Buck will be first cover.

49:13.520 --> 49:15.887
Hey, Chris, you up to
take the lead on this?

49:30.200 --> 49:31.406
Window!

49:50.400 --> 49:51.401
Go!

49:59.080 --> 50:00.081
Going up!

50:02.440 --> 50:03.566
What the fuck are y'all doing?

50:03.680 --> 50:05.648
- Get the fuck back in the house.
- Fuck you!

50:05.760 --> 50:08.700
This is my house. Don't be telling me
to get the fuck back inside my house.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.006
Breach!

50:13.360 --> 50:14.441
Police!

50:30.760 --> 50:32.125
Check that closet.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.001
Clear!

50:35.200 --> 50:36.700
Couch on the left, stairs on the right.

50:36.800 --> 50:37.847
- Copy.
- Moving.

50:39.640 --> 50:41.961
Check that couch, check that couch.

50:42.440 --> 50:44.044
Cover. Cover.

50:44.440 --> 50:45.441
Moving up.

50:55.960 --> 50:57.928
Get down! Get down, motherfucker!

51:03.160 --> 51:04.620
Check that bathroom.

51:04.720 --> 51:05.721
Go.

51:09.640 --> 51:10.880
Clear.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.820
There's a baby in the bed
in the bedroom on the right.

51:12.920 --> 51:14.570
I'm going right. Go left.

51:14.720 --> 51:15.767
Go, move.

51:17.240 --> 51:18.241
Clear.

51:19.160 --> 51:20.844
Check the closet behind me.

51:21.840 --> 51:23.820
Get some hands for that baby.

51:23.920 --> 51:25.604
- Contact.
- Clear.

51:26.160 --> 51:27.780
Termite, come on out, you dumb-fuck.

51:27.880 --> 51:29.530
Let's not get your fucking baby killed!

51:36.080 --> 51:37.980
Gomez, go for that door.

51:38.080 --> 51:39.206
Cover me.

52:01.440 --> 52:03.761
Two, go closet on left.
Three, go behind the door.

52:03.880 --> 52:05.405
Closet on left. I got it.

52:06.080 --> 52:07.844
- Door clear.
- Closet clear.

52:08.880 --> 52:10.120
Moving up.

52:11.720 --> 52:13.210
Bathroom on the right.

52:16.120 --> 52:17.565
Bathroom clear.

52:21.560 --> 52:23.340
Three, clear the closet on the left.

52:23.440 --> 52:24.500
Two, go right.

52:24.600 --> 52:26.284
- Got the closet.
- Check under that bed.

52:27.720 --> 52:28.721
Clear.

52:31.440 --> 52:32.601
Moving up.

52:33.600 --> 52:34.660
Three, go bedroom on the right.

52:34.760 --> 52:36.000
- Two, go bathroom.
- Got it.

52:37.720 --> 52:39.404
- Bathroom's clear!
- Bedroom's clear!

52:40.600 --> 52:42.250
Moving down.

52:51.040 --> 52:52.660
He's out, he's on foot. He's on the run!

52:52.760 --> 52:53.841
Go, go, go!

52:56.520 --> 52:58.010
Get down, get down!

53:13.600 --> 53:15.364
Get down! Get on the ground!

53:25.000 --> 53:26.001
Fuck!

53:28.280 --> 53:29.964
- Hey, you good?
- I'm good.

53:52.320 --> 53:53.321
Go!

54:11.160 --> 54:12.161
Chris.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.001
Chris!

54:28.440 --> 54:30.249
Chris, come on, man. Come on.

54:32.240 --> 54:33.605
Are you okay?

54:34.120 --> 54:36.043
- You all right?
- Go, go, go.

55:07.760 --> 55:10.286
South side, heading east.
Marcus, give me your 20, man.

55:28.440 --> 55:30.220
Hands! Show me your hands!
Get on the ground!

55:30.320 --> 55:32.380
Get on the ground!
Hey, did you see somebody?

55:32.480 --> 55:33.925
Where'd they go?

55:38.400 --> 55:39.447
Fuck.

55:46.360 --> 55:47.930
Get back, motherfucker, or he die!

57:56.640 --> 57:58.244
What was his name?

57:59.560 --> 58:00.607
Tank.

58:03.400 --> 58:04.980
- That's a good name.
- It's a great name.

58:05.080 --> 58:06.730
- That's a good name.
- Yeah.

58:09.440 --> 58:10.930
Sorry, man.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.606
I can't remember one shot from yesterday.

58:18.920 --> 58:20.490
Is that weird?

58:20.600 --> 58:23.251
No, man, it's called survival
stress reaction, you know?

58:23.360 --> 58:24.500
Mmm-hmm.

58:24.600 --> 58:26.443
Chemicals flood your brain.

58:27.440 --> 58:29.780
Forebrain stops working,
your amygdala fires up

58:29.880 --> 58:31.120
- and you're just...
- Mmm.

58:33.520 --> 58:35.284
I didn't see him coming.

58:35.840 --> 58:38.320
Right? I mean,
he just came out of nowhere.

58:39.160 --> 58:41.128
It could happen to anybody, man.

58:41.960 --> 58:43.530
Well, it didn't happen to you.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.260
I'm a badass motherfucker, dude.

58:53.840 --> 58:55.740
I'm going to take a piss.

58:55.840 --> 58:57.046
Have fun.

59:05.360 --> 59:07.727
Do you know what
this song is about, Michael?

59:09.000 --> 59:10.001
No?

59:11.640 --> 59:13.130
Then I will tell you.

59:14.880 --> 59:19.660
It is about two lovers betrayed
by the secrets they keep for others.

59:19.760 --> 59:21.420
And they must choose.

59:21.520 --> 59:23.090
Exile or death.

59:25.080 --> 59:27.242
Like me and my dear Vassili.

59:28.480 --> 59:31.086
Vassili is finally coming home to me.

59:32.480 --> 59:36.882
Once you have completed this job,
they will release him into Israeli custody.

59:38.880 --> 59:40.700
We are going to be a family again.

59:42.160 --> 59:43.140
Where's Felix?

59:43.240 --> 59:46.220
We own the secrets of kings, me and him.

59:46.320 --> 59:48.721
This is why we have survived so long.

59:51.560 --> 59:52.925
Where's Felix?

59:53.360 --> 59:58.969
Felix and Elena won't
be joining us tonight.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:04.842
Here. Hear it for yourself.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.524
- Elena?
- Michael.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.780
Where are you?

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.325
Irina didn't tell you?

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:23.780
I'm gonna ask you one last time, Elena.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.020
Fuck are you?

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:28.329
Felix, baby. It's your dad.
Daddy wants to speak with you.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.820
I swam with the dolphins,
Daddy, me and Mommy.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.940
Where you at?

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:37.300
We're staying at the beach
and Auntie Irina said we're going

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.260
to come here to take me to the zoo...

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.460
- What do you mean?
- ...for my birthday.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.860
Okay, love you. Bye.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.380
No, no... Wait a second.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.448
Felix. No, Felix...

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.260
Elat. Our family home.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.089
Three hours south of Tel Aviv.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.010
Felix seems to love it.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.660
He loves the sea.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.260
Me, I do not like it much myself.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.340
There is something idiotic about it.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.807
Take a look. He is so cute.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.660
Yeah, see, there is Elena.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.841
No, no, no, Irina.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:23.851
We're doing the job.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.570
We're doing the job.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.642
She has a very nice ass, my sister.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:36.007
So, this is the objective.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.803
The security key
and gate codes you will need.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:51.961
The case arrives tomorrow night,
is there for 24 hours, then it ships.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.100
We meet one more time after this.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.486
How that goes is up to you,

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:02.004
and then we decide when Felix
comes home from vacation.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.963
It would seem the house is burning
and the clock is ticking, Michael.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.580
The room goes quiet.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:43.886
All right, everybody, listen up.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.260
This is a cop's brain. All right?

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:50.045
This is a cop's brain on some shit.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.970
This is a cop asshole.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:57.300
This is a cop's asshole in supermax.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.845
Any questions?

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.260
That's a big asshole.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.820
Hey, I've got to talk to you.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.780
- Who the fuck is this?
- Don't worry, boys. Wait.

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.020
Hey, Jack, get them some drinks.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.220
Man, come on, get them some drinks.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.740
All right, you got it.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:16.002
All right, you heard the man.
Drinks on Marcus.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.060
You fucking nuts coming here!

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.242
You don't think somebody
from the precinct might recognize you?

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.970
Get up, you stupid fuck!

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.491
Don't fucking do this, Marcus.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:33.964
You come near me again,
I swear to God, I will fucking kill you!

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.700
You ever actually used your gun, huh?

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.802
Put one in someone
that doesn't have it coming to them?

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.046
- Shut up.
- I know you, man!

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.020
- You might not think I do, but I know you!
- Shut the fuck up!

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.820
- You ain't gonna do this!
- Shut up!

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.500
Look, I can see it in your eyes.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.820
You are a fucking coward, all right?

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.140
What, you think this
is gonna make you a man?

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.180
Shut up!

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.931
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.500
Is that him?

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.620
It's all right, guys. He was just leaving.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.643
Didn't you hear the officer?

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:16.060
What was that all about, man?

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.980
Some piece-of-shit source I used to use.

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.889
All right, let's go get a drink.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.240
Forget about it.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.685
Get the fuck inside.
Just get the fuck inside!

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.780
Like you know who you trying to tell?

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.340
Get your ass inside!
No, you're not doing this tonight.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:32.566
Get your hands off me!

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.620
You're not pulling
any more tricks tonight.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.768
- That's the boyfriend?
- Yep.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.447
Hmm.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.011
Piece of work.

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.620
We'll put a tail on both of them.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:45.060
All right. I've got four in tail, so...

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.889
Not a very healthy diet.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:52.326
Sweet.

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.570
That's disgusting.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.660
Waste not, want not.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:08.900
Speak.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.380
Uh, hey, I got you that info.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.528
Gabriel Charles Welch, 35.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.961
He, uh, served three years on the force.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.820
Oh, you sure?

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.260
Yeah, racked up a slew of reprimands

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:21.364
before getting dismissed
for a questionable shooting.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.180
Questionable how?

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.805
Suicide by cop.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.487
Associates?

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.370
Yeah. None on file.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.500
Oh, if there's one, there's another.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.364
Ling, you always come through for me.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.489
I have no doubt you will again.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.325
Fucking cop.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.721
Come on.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.362
That's it.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.561
Hmm.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.805
Kicking dope, huh?

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.329
No fun, right?

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:41.241
Oh...

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.402
Oh, it kicks in nice.

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.960
Oh, whoa.

01:06:56.040 --> 01:07:00.602
This can go down one of two ways for you.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:45.260
The girlfriend says Gabe and his brother
run with a Michael Atwood.

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.060
Get eyes on him.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.500
Uh, she also claims
that Gabe's brother, Russell,

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.940
wound up dead the other day.

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.860
Let's see if we can't turn up a body.

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:55.500
Got you. Uh, hold on a sec. Look.

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.682
Ling's been trying to get a hold of you.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:00.500
She said that, um, Gabe Welch

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.060
finally stopped in Highland Park.

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.300
And he's been on his bike
in front of some house.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.300
Highland Park. What's the address?

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.368
Um... 806 Willow Drive.

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.140
Apprehend him right away.

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.380
Get every available unit to that address!

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.686
Copy that, boss.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.321
Are you guys okay?

01:08:53.439 --> 01:08:54.487
Yeah, we're fine.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.060
Hey, boss. We lost him.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.620
- Oh, God damn it.
- Sorry.

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.051
Lost who?

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.203
Why weren't you answering your phone?

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:03.500
I'm sorry. Look, Jeff, we're fine, man.

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:04.647
Everything's all right.

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.300
Who is this guy?

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:07.481
Gabe Welch.

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:10.100
Ring any bells?

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.180
No.

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:12.260
I never heard that name in my life.

01:09:12.359 --> 01:09:14.060
Well, he was a cop...

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.049
Hey, there, little buddy.

01:09:17.359 --> 01:09:19.680
- How are you doing? You okay?
- All right, baby. Come on.

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.060
I'll get him back.

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.207
Go ahead.

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:27.287
He was a cop. And now, he's part
of the crew we're investigating.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.408
Why would he come here?

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:36.448
I don't know. You're investigating him,
maybe he came looking for you?

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.962
I mean, that's just too coincidental.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.500
Speak.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.620
Michael Atwood.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:50.819
Ex-private security contractor.
He worked for Blackwater.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.260
He and Russell Welch were set
to be indicted for arms smuggling

01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:56.728
in a federal investigation
with Vassili Vlaslov in '08.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.860
The case was dropped after
four witnesses went missing.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.380
What's a Vassili Vlaslov?

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:04.460
A Russian Jew.

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.100
Russian mob boss to be exact.

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.100
Get this. Putin's so scared of this guy,

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.806
he put him in the Gulag
four years ago without charges.

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:14.700
Vlaslov's wife, Irina, has been running
the organization from here.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:16.020
Totally visible.

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.406
It's the big, bad wolf, baby.

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.860
The fucking La Kosher Nostra.

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.420
Exactly. Uh, the captain
wants us to put eyes on her.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:24.249
He's already detailed us bodies.

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.660
What?

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.762
You're doing something about Gabe.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.660
I told you, I'm handling it.

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.000
Oh, really?

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:44.371
Gabe now is under
fucking surveillance, Mike.

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:47.165
They got people all
over him right now, as we speak.

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:48.980
How?

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:51.731
Oh, that whore girlfriend of his talked.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.140
They on me?

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:55.940
Not yet.

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.580
But soon.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.444
And he knows it all.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:03.780
I ain't asking you. I'm telling you.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.325
Do something about Gabe.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.060
Mike...

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.220
You see what you made me do, man?

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:27.340
You see what you've made me do?

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.420
I'm sorry.

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.522
- Mike, Mike, Mike. Please, don't.
- You're out, Gabe!

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.780
I'm through with you!
I'm through with you, do you understand?

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.220
Mike, Mike, Mike.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:37.605
If it weren't for your brother, I'd bury you
and your fucking whore right now!

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.740
It's going down and you need
to stay the fuck away!

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.500
Fine, fine, fine. Please.

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:42.780
What happens to Leah?

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.041
Just disappear, man!

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:48.340
I'm gone, I'm gone.
I promise, I promise. Mike, Mike...

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:52.604
Mike. Mike. Hey, I promise!

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:54.300
Mike!

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.526
Fuck!

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.611
Have we found Gabe Welch?

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.731
Uh, no, we're still looking.

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.340
What about Michael Atwood?

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:36.410
Uh, I got units placed
outside his place, but it's empty.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:37.820
Mmm-hmm.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.540
Irina Vlaslov?

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.420
Uh, judge denied our request
for a surveillance warrant.

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:43.521
Hmm.

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:46.641
Well, have you followed up
on ex-military with records?

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:48.980
Yeah, I mean, there's hundreds.

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:51.048
We're still going through 'em.

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.980
So that's it?

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.060
- So far, but we...
- Yeah.

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.447
I got Patterson working on something.

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:10.020
Does anyone believe in Jesus Christ,
our Lord and fucking savior

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:13.090
and all his miserable, dog-faced saints?

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.041
I was raised Jehovah, so...

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:17.207
Can't say I do, boss.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.620
Mmm-hmm. So does anyone believe

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.140
that cops have a sixth sense,

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:24.651
can intuit things?

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.220
- Hmm...
- Yeah, I mean, you do, yes.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.500
You...

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:33.220
So does anyone believe
maybe something very big

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:34.970
is about to go down?

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:38.140
Sure, boss.

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:39.740
Yeah, of course.

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:44.209
So, does anyone believe
that maybe it's better

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:47.700
to do something more than sitting around

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:50.804
giving me a bunch of
"I don't fucking knows"?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.001
Huh?

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:01.882
Yeah?

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.040
Right.

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.443
Give a holla if anything changes.

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.649
Surveillance lost Gabe last night.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.962
And Major Crimes is looking for you.

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.245
Well, they'll be looking
a long time after today.

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:24.850
You all right with this, man?

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.844
Everything cool with you?

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.245
Yeah, homeboy.

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.567
We've got him right where we want him.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:37.729
Detective Belmont,
you ready to do some dirt?

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.126
Huh?

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:40.969
- I'm dirty.
- Yeah, you are.

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.370
I know you are.

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.890
We got here.

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:02.921
You all right?

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.620
Yeah, man, I'm good. You?

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:07.085
- Yep.
- Good.

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:08.820
So where are we going?

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:09.940
Going to see an informant of mine.

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:12.088
A dough boy named Cory Dubose.

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.122
So every time he hears
the Rollin 40s moving something

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.481
he, uh, gives me a call,
lets me know what's up.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.329
Let's see what he's got. Let's go.

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.484
1012, Smith and Marietta.

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.241
1086, domestic dispute in progress.

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:54.203
Now, where's this guy at?

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.206
Marcus?

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.570
Hey, man, where you at?

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.924
Marcus, where'd you go?

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:14.607
Oh, shit.

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:16.241
Oh, shit.

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:17.921
Shit.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:23.167
Shit.

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.491
Police! Atlanta Police Department.

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:06.380
Put your gun down! Put it down!
Put it on the ground, man.

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:07.900
- Wait, wait.
- Put it down on the ground.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.060
- You're a mark.
- I'm going to shoot you.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.220
Drop the fucking weapon. I will shoot you.

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.380
Will you please shut up?

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.005
- You're a mark...
- Drop it on the ground.

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:14.281
Behind you!

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:24.980
Shit!

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.762
342, shots fired. Subject down.

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:44.122
Uh, Eighth and Washington.

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:47.140
Perp running is ID'd Luis Pinto.

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:55.964
Hey, man, talk to me.

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:06.568
How are you doing, man?

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:14.361
Huh?

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.491
Marcus!

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:18.401
Marcus!

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:20.925
Hey, Marcus!

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.724
Hey, man, look at me.

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:29.340
What's your name, man, huh?

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:30.900
What's your name? You'll be all right.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.180
You'll be all right.

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:33.281
You're all right.

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.020
I'll just put my hand here,
it'll help you a little bit.

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:37.531
It'll help with the blood.

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.580
Hey.

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:40.761
Listen to me.

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:43.807
It's all right.

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:46.250
Hey.

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:48.081
What's your name?

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.609
Shh. Slow down.

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.820
Call it in, man. He's bleeding out.

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:54.900
Call it in.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.924
Pinto came through.
He came out of nowhere, man.

01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.340
He just shot him. Call it in, man.

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:00.601
Hey, what the...

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:19.281
Marcus.

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:22.721
Oh, shit...

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:27.130
Hey. Marcus...

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:28.971
You hear me, man?

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:36.804
This is Unit 342,
I have an officer down. 999!

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:40.884
Unit 342. Officer down. Triple 9!

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:48.326
Advise if responding.
Shots fired on scene.

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:51.580
All units copy. Triple 9.
Eighth and Washington.

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:53.170
There it is!

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.528
No, no, no. Wrong entrance.

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:20.681
Back it up.

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:22.725
Back it up.

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.211
You guys have been here before.

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:26.740
You know what?

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:27.966
I don't even...

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.602
Let's go. Triple 9. Let's go!

01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:58.460
Jeff, did you hear the dispatch?

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.403
- Yeah. Triple 9.
- It's Chris.

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:03.100
- Fuck!
- Let's go!

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:04.300
Lock down the scene.

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:05.447
Ling, get Colby!

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:07.721
Heads up.

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.046
You know who made the call?

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:44.128
I don't know. Jeff!

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.125
I see him.

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:53.860
So we don't know if Chris is down?

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.140
We're not sure. Jeff!

01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:58.288
- Jesus fucking... Get a grip!
- I got it!

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:20.020
Move!

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.260
Talk to her. Talk to her!

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:22.771
Just do what the fuck they want!

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.660
Just do what the fuck they want!

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:26.364
Just do it!

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:28.780
All right, up!

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:31.201
On your feet. Hands up.
Come here. Against the wall!

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:32.886
Come on. Move!

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:37.242
- Come on. Down. Down!
- All right.

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:41.563
I need a unit for a 211-Adam
in progress at DHS Holding.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.205
Repeat. 211-Adam.

01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:45.004
Should we respond to that?

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:50.740
Are you guys hearing this 211?

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:52.729
Yeah, I fucking hear it!

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:53.881
Jeff!

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:58.740
Northwest corner of Eighth
and Washington. He's lucid.

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:00.046
Officer is down.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:09.409
What the fuck is going on?

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.966
All right.
That's good enough, right there.

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.611
You're going to do
exactly what we ask of you.

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:50.220
You got 10 times that amount
strapped to your head.

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:53.780
We can't open the vault.
It's on a rotating time lock.

01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:55.245
There's no override.

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:02.820
Received. Any units in vicinity?

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:04.340
Fuck me! Send the other car!

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:05.965
Ling, you guys are on the 211.

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.041
No, no. Jeff!

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:13.410
Watch it! No!

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.284
Dispatch, this is Charlie 463
responding to the 211.

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.820
Fuck. Jesus fucking Christ.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:29.285
I'm seven out. Send more units.

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:48.846
Fire in the hole.

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:50.325
Two, one.

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:19.210
Response is in.

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:21.846
One car so far. ETA is seven minutes.

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.167
Whoa, whoa... Jeff, watch it.

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.969
- Back it up. Back it up.
- Let's back it up.

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.940
- Chris Allen. Where's Chris Allen?
- This way.

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.724
No. Don't shoot!

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.491
Be advised, Atlanta PD en route.
ETA currently unknown.

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.444
Tac team, Mike.
Eleven o'clock high. Four guns.

01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:20.602
Tac team, hold until
transmitter is out of range.

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:29.926
Okay, that's it. Green, green, green.
Weapons free.

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:46.205
Get an updated ETA on this.

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:48.860
So this guy's a Latino,
about 30 years old.

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.962
Very slight build. Local tattoos, yeah...

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:53.207
- Jeff.
- Are you doing all right?

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.125
Captain, it's Franco.

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:47.648
I'm on the 999.

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:50.487
En route now.

01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:54.881
Damn it.

01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:09.727
Are you sure you haven't
seen this Gabe Welch before?

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:13.700
I saw him about a week ago.

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.928
He came to a bar Marcus and I were at.

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:20.180
They got into an argument.
I don't know... I didn't hear much of it.

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:24.380
But Marcus said that he was just
some CI he was working with.

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:29.088
Man, so you saw him at the bar,
at your house, here.

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:32.727
Now, that is a cosmic
series of coincidences.

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.540
Remind me to get a lottery ticket.

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:38.020
Now, what about Luis Pinto?

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:40.964
Luis Pinto's surrounded by SWAT
a couple of blocks from here.

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:43.928
Detective Rodriguez. Homicide.

01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:46.283
Detective Allen. Major Crimes.

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:49.540
All right, well maybe
we'll get some answers out of him.

01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:52.246
What, you think
they're just going to arrest him...

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:53.620
Put him in a comfy cell?

01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:54.767
They're not.

01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:56.740
He's right.

01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:58.285
You know this guy?

01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:03.100
No, I didn't know him.

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:04.804
But Marcus sure did.

01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:09.126
Oh, if you gentlemen will excuse me.

01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.442
Rest of you get the hell out of here.

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:21.169
We need to get to that 211, boss.
It's a clusterfuck.

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:23.328
Let me guess. Our crew.

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:25.885
That's what it sounds like.

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:28.690
Well, not all of them.

01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:01.562
What the fuck is this?
Did you wrap it for us?

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:03.491
No, man, it's for Felix.

01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:26.249
I was not sure you could pull it off.

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:28.805
I wasn't left much choice.

01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:33.682
What about the rest of your crew, huh?

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:36.608
I should like to meet them finally.

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.041
They're gone.

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:41.700
Are they?

01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:44.260
So you don't think I could shake
some trees around the department

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:47.180
and watch a few dirty cops
fall from the limbs?

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:48.964
Don't give me that look.

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:51.300
You and I, we pray at the same altar!

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.980
Irina, I've been listening to you talk

01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:56.686
just about as long as I'm gonna.

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:42.090
Where's my son?

01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:46.284
Where's my son, you wretched fucking cunt?

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.766
Felix!

01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:26.682
We train dogs to fuck our prisoners.

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:29.370
Can you imagine?

01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.620
That's what they say.

01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:33.420
That we degrade them with trained dogs.

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:37.642
I can only guess this is how Elena felt
every time she was fucked by a monkey.

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:43.820
I should kill you, I really should.

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:46.526
But my fucking sister
would never forgive me.

01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:51.684
And more importantly,
how would Felix go on loving me so?

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:56.620
Take your money and go, Michael.

01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:58.260
Do not look for Felix.

01:35:58.360 --> 01:35:59.885
Because I will hear it.

01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:22.040
I would be happy to tell him that this
is a good-bye gift from his father.

01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:25.128
Anything for that boy.

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:01.860
Hey.

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:03.700
The bullet fragment is
embedded in the medial...

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.005
Are you okay?

01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:10.963
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:14.244
- You're bleeding.
- It's not mine.

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:16.780
- How's he doing?
- He's out of surgery.

01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:18.962
He's got a bullet lodged in his skull,

01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:21.420
and they can't get it out because
of the swelling in the brain

01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:23.488
which may or may not go down.

01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:25.811
- Hey, Chris.
- Go on.

01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:29.764
What's up, man?

01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:32.201
Sergeant Nelson just phoned. Pinto's dead.

01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:35.162
SWAT put a dozen holes
in the motherfucker.

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:37.780
He went out blazing.

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:39.180
They brought him in about an hour ago.

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:40.770
I haven't had a chance to clean him up.

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:45.161
- Are those his things there?
- Yeah. Those are them.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.684
Is this everything?

01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:52.131
Yeah, that's it.

01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:57.762
Hey, Mike, it's me. Franco.

01:39:58.160 --> 01:39:59.860
Take it easy, man.

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:01.769
Just fucking with you.

01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:06.645
You're a fucking funny guy, Franco.

01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:08.765
You got our money?

01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:13.006
We're all good.

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:16.366
How's Marcus?

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:19.649
That dumb fuck's still breathing.

01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:23.450
I'll take care of that.

01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:26.124
Just like I took care of Gabe's whore.

01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:28.760
Left her body in the shopping cart.

01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:33.450
Are you all right?

01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:35.530
I'm a little sore.

01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:39.481
Yeah.

01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:42.805
So that's it, huh?

01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:46.005
Until the next one.

01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:51.324
Yeah, Franco. Yeah.

01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:44.900
Come here, dude.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.685
So my boss, he's got a rule, right?

01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:51.740
First one of us who takes a gun
off the street gets the day off.

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:54.127
Get to go home.
Sit around, put my feet up.

01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.084
See that, dude?
You just told me something.

01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:00.524
I bet if I lifted up your shirt,
you'd have a gun.

01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:02.605
You know what I'm saying?

01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:05.089
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Huh?

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:08.810
Now, tell me something
and I'll forget about that gun.

01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:10.767
What do you want to know?

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.929
You know my partner Marcus?

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:14.767
Yeah.

01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:16.420
Was he here the morning that he got shot?

01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:19.205
Was he at the park without me?

01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:24.086
That morning, pulled up,
talked to my boy, Luis.

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:28.460
Marcus came here
and he talked to your boy, Luis,

01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:29.700
on the morning that he got shot?

01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:30.801
Yeah.

01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:34.971
- Don't mess with me, man.
- No, man, I'm serious.

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.922
All right, dude. Hey, give me the gun.

01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:06.321
- Who is it?
- Jeff, it's Chris.

01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:12.805
Jesus, man.

01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:17.762
If your mother could see me now.

01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:20.770
There's people you can
talk to about that, man.

01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:22.724
There's no shame in it.

01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:25.966
What's IA saying?

01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:31.860
IA is saying nobody's above
suspicion, including me.

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:35.646
And Rodriguez from homicide is dismissing
the thing as pure coincidence.

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:37.967
What?

01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:42.450
You know, I think it might
be worse than that.

01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:46.809
I think that Marcus was in on it.

01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:51.161
I think he had Luis Pinto try to kill me.

01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:54.964
Can you prove that?

01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:56.485
Maybe I can.

01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:59.482
Marcus and Gabe had history.

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:02.763
They were both stationed
at the same precinct together.

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.060
Oh.

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:06.049
So, four-man crew...

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:10.740
Michael Atwood
and one-and-a-half dead cops.

01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:14.640
You've got to ask yourself,
who's that fourth guy?

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:19.161
Hey.

01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:21.580
Gabe Welch's girlfriend, my CI.

01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:25.127
Took two in the chest
and one in the back of the head.

01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:28.171
I should have seen that coming.

01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:33.242
Somebody's cleaning up after himself
and my bet is he wears a badge.

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:42.100
- Boss?
- I need a favor.

01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:43.486
Anything.

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:46.365
I need a hard copy on Leah Green's murder.

01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:50.766
I need the name of the lead cop
on the scene when they found the body.

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:55.770
Sure, it has to be
our little secret though.

01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:30.765
Look at you.

01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:34.765
Look at you, you little
worthless motherfucker.

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:55.651
Figured I'd find you here. How's he doing?

01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:56.860
What's up?

01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:00.522
I was just wondering if you wouldn't
mind coming back to the station with me.

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:05.290
I still need to get
a full statement from you.

01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:08.324
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:17.925
All right.

01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:58.780
Hey, Jeff, I'm in an elevator.
I might lose you.

01:46:58.880 --> 01:46:59.900
Chris? Chris?

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.060
Yeah, yeah. I can hear you. Go.

01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:02.620
Don't do anything.

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:04.290
It's Rodriguez.
