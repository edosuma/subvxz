21:56.103 --> 21:57.379
Where did they come from?

21:57.413 --> 21:59.068
You know, it's like one day,
everything was fine,

21:59.103 --> 22:01.413
and the next, there were these
fuckin' scooters everywhere.

22:01.448 --> 22:03.034
You don't like scooters?

22:03.068 --> 22:05.206
I just think people
should drive, m'kay?

22:05.241 --> 22:07.241
I don't think
people should scoot.

22:07.275 --> 22:10.241
I just -- I just hope
the future isn't scootin'.
