00:44.464 --> 00:47.504
- Gentlemen, be ready for anything.

00:47.504 --> 00:51.171
- There's a door on the
left, I'll check it.

00:52.964 --> 00:55.185
- Reese, looks like we have company.

00:55.185 --> 00:57.935
I'll stall them, you head inside.

00:59.516 --> 01:01.015
My scanner's picking up a massing reading

01:01.015 --> 01:02.625
of chromium and vanadium.

01:02.625 --> 01:04.804
The emerald has to be that way.

01:04.804 --> 01:05.887
- Understood.

01:08.716 --> 01:09.883
- It's locked!

01:25.320 --> 01:27.291
- Remember, the mission is to get in,

01:27.291 --> 01:28.662
and get the emerald back.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.504
- Jayden!

01:35.893 --> 01:37.613
- Be careful, we have
no idea how many people

01:37.613 --> 01:39.653
Pyro Ed has guarding his prize.

01:39.653 --> 01:41.070
- Good luck, Jay.

02:01.137 --> 02:02.436
- It's been what?

02:02.436 --> 02:04.996
One week since we've last
seen each other, Jayden?

02:04.996 --> 02:06.025
- I missed you.

02:06.025 --> 02:07.097
- When will you learn to stay out

02:07.097 --> 02:08.846
of other people's business?

02:08.846 --> 02:10.937
It's a bit annoying.

02:10.937 --> 02:13.354
- It's a hard habit to break.

02:15.265 --> 02:16.145
- Damn.

02:16.145 --> 02:18.846
Today, I'm gonna teach you a lesson!

02:18.846 --> 02:21.460
We both have fires burning deep inside,

02:21.460 --> 02:24.326
that's our drive, our passion!

02:24.326 --> 02:28.608
The difference being, is
my fire burns brighter!

02:33.436 --> 02:34.436
Stop moving!

02:40.053 --> 02:41.944
- I like you, Ed.

02:41.944 --> 02:43.736
Always improving.

02:43.736 --> 02:45.069
Maybe next time.

02:49.332 --> 02:51.915
- One day, sooner than later...

02:57.848 --> 02:59.306
- We have the emerald.

02:59.306 --> 03:01.139
Let's get out of here.

03:02.251 --> 03:03.251
- Nice work.

04:46.319 --> 04:47.961
- That sucks.

04:47.961 --> 04:49.128
I was thirsty.

04:54.112 --> 04:55.763
I'm also hungry.

04:55.763 --> 05:00.232
And my nose tells me someone
close by is grilling.

05:31.605 --> 05:32.438
- Hey kid!

05:32.438 --> 05:33.334
What are you doing?

05:33.334 --> 05:35.405
- Thanks for the lunch, buddy!

05:35.405 --> 05:37.589
- That's my meat, come on man.

05:37.589 --> 05:38.922
- I said thanks.

05:55.140 --> 05:57.289
- Shit, I'm late!

06:34.714 --> 06:36.337
I'm sorry.

06:36.337 --> 06:40.514
I'm a little nervous,
and have no idea why.

06:40.514 --> 06:43.486
- Agent Hill, this isn't
gonna take too long, is it?

06:43.486 --> 06:44.319
- No sir.

06:44.319 --> 06:45.916
I just have a short presentation

06:45.916 --> 06:49.065
that features a few graphs,
charts, and statistics,

06:49.065 --> 06:50.445
and then I thought we'd
discuss some things

06:50.445 --> 06:52.025
I've been researching and reading about.

06:52.025 --> 06:52.858
- Okay.

06:52.858 --> 06:53.691
- Sorry.

06:53.691 --> 06:54.628
Anyways, moving on.

06:54.628 --> 06:56.212
This presentation involves a way

06:56.212 --> 06:57.846
to expand the agency.

06:57.846 --> 06:59.236
A couple of weeks ago you asked some of us

06:59.236 --> 07:02.306
to come up with ideas for the future.

07:02.306 --> 07:03.636
I thought a lot about this topic,

07:03.636 --> 07:06.884
and I came up with many different ideas.

07:06.884 --> 07:09.636
But I personally think
the best one is kids.

07:09.636 --> 07:11.004
- You have 10 minutes.

07:11.004 --> 07:12.626
- Teaching kids what we
as agents already know

07:12.626 --> 07:14.543
could be a golden weapon.

07:14.543 --> 07:16.276
I mean, who would ever guess a kid

07:16.276 --> 07:18.895
is secretly a government agent?

07:18.895 --> 07:20.684
Say down the road there's a crisis,

07:20.684 --> 07:22.904
say a world crisis.

07:22.904 --> 07:24.570
Kids are the answer.

07:24.570 --> 07:27.104
After all, childen are the future.

07:27.104 --> 07:29.624
This world will be theirs one day.

07:29.624 --> 07:30.634
Growing up is still important,

07:30.634 --> 07:31.999
that's why they'll have regular classes

07:31.999 --> 07:34.834
like math and writing,
but in a private building.

07:34.834 --> 07:37.474
This building will be where
they also train and live,

07:37.474 --> 07:39.785
at least temporarily.

07:39.785 --> 07:43.154
- You mean a base, like a kid's base?

07:43.154 --> 07:45.224
- I describe it more like a house.

07:45.224 --> 07:47.751
- We're not paying for that.

07:47.751 --> 07:48.791
- For what?

07:48.791 --> 07:52.203
- For kids to live alone, that's nonsense.

07:52.203 --> 07:54.534
We do some crazy shit here.

07:54.534 --> 07:56.694
Oh, I can see it now.

07:56.694 --> 08:01.414
Misuse of weapons or worse,
what if they blow our cover?

08:01.414 --> 08:02.923
Most of the country doesn't even know

08:02.923 --> 08:05.185
that Section 62 exists.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.846
- They won't be alone.

08:06.846 --> 08:07.714
- You're right.

08:07.714 --> 08:09.427
They'll be having wild parties.

08:09.427 --> 08:10.787
- That won't happen.

08:10.787 --> 08:11.620
- Why?

08:11.620 --> 08:14.118
Who's gonna step up and
be the one to stop it?

08:14.118 --> 08:15.201
- Me, I will.

08:16.147 --> 08:17.305
- You, Jay?

08:17.305 --> 08:19.494
Nah uh, out of the question.

08:19.494 --> 08:21.358
You're one of my best agents.

08:21.358 --> 08:22.328
I need you.

08:22.328 --> 08:25.339
I need you here, working for me.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.249
- I'll make you a deal.

08:27.249 --> 08:29.739
If you could find a severe issue or flaw,

08:29.739 --> 08:32.198
or ask me something I
don't have the answer for,

08:32.198 --> 08:33.638
I'll drop it.

08:33.638 --> 08:38.187
- Alright, so, tell me about
a regular day in your house.

08:38.187 --> 08:40.529
- They'll wake up early
and have a set schedule.

08:40.529 --> 08:42.058
I've already talked with a few agents.

08:42.058 --> 08:42.947
- And?

08:42.947 --> 08:44.787
- And, a few of them are interested,

08:44.787 --> 08:47.619
if the program gets approved, of course.

08:47.619 --> 08:50.238
I was thinking they
should be the teachers.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.019
- How long were you looking to test this

08:52.019 --> 08:53.564
idea of yours for?

08:53.564 --> 08:55.409
- Three months, sir.

08:55.409 --> 08:58.289
- And tell me, what will
your neighbors think?

08:58.289 --> 08:59.387
- Well, I think if they ask,

08:59.387 --> 09:01.209
we could say they're
foreign exchange students

09:01.209 --> 09:02.790
being tutored at home.

09:02.790 --> 09:05.070
- Well, that's a pretty
stupid thing to tell them.

09:05.070 --> 09:06.121
- Maybe.

09:06.121 --> 09:07.689
But it's also a little stupid to assume

09:07.689 --> 09:09.110
my neighbors will ask what's going on.

09:09.110 --> 09:11.808
My neighbors don't bother me.

09:11.808 --> 09:14.649
- Are we going to be using
your house as the base?

09:14.649 --> 09:17.699
- If that's what it takes, I have room.

09:17.699 --> 09:19.137
- How many kids?

09:19.137 --> 09:22.328
I don't remember you discussing that part.

09:22.328 --> 09:23.510
- Two or three.

09:23.510 --> 09:25.926
I personally think we
should start with two,

09:25.926 --> 09:28.687
and bring a third one in
to see how everyone adapts.

09:28.687 --> 09:30.619
If the program ends up
being something we continue,

09:30.619 --> 09:32.367
we need to test all the variables.

09:32.367 --> 09:33.200
- If?

09:33.200 --> 09:35.019
You're already having doubts?

09:35.019 --> 09:36.238
- Harrison.

09:36.238 --> 09:38.409
You've known me for over eight years.

09:38.409 --> 09:41.299
I love my job, I work as
hard as I possibly can,

09:41.299 --> 09:42.761
and I'm always on time.

09:42.761 --> 09:45.081
- You were late today.

09:45.081 --> 09:46.769
- Give it a shot.

09:46.769 --> 09:49.244
I know for a fact no one
came up with a better idea.

09:49.244 --> 09:50.750
And you said it yourself.

09:50.750 --> 09:54.009
We need to make change
now, for the future.

09:54.009 --> 09:55.566
Change is a hard pill to swallow,

09:55.566 --> 09:59.778
unless you're a kid, unless you're young.

09:59.778 --> 10:01.818
Then it's not really change,

10:01.818 --> 10:05.030
but being guided in the right direction.

10:05.030 --> 10:08.201
- Look, I'm still not sure about this.

10:08.201 --> 10:10.167
It seems highly unlikely that this could

10:10.167 --> 10:12.737
cause a disaster though.

10:12.737 --> 10:16.409
So, I guess I'll give you the green light.

10:16.409 --> 10:18.079
But I want more details though.

10:18.079 --> 10:20.401
Now, you send me an email
with all the classes

10:20.401 --> 10:23.129
you have planned, and all
the agents you have planned

10:23.129 --> 10:24.649
on teaching them.

10:24.649 --> 10:28.689
This may be your program,
but this is still my agency,

10:28.689 --> 10:32.201
and these kids will, unfortunately,

10:32.201 --> 10:33.951
be my responsibility.

10:39.823 --> 10:42.156
- I'll clean this up, sorry.

11:07.736 --> 11:11.395
- So you're really gonna do this, huh?

11:11.395 --> 11:14.734
Even though everyone thinks you shouldn't?

11:14.734 --> 11:15.651
- Everyone?

11:16.553 --> 11:18.720
Hold on, that's not right.

11:20.726 --> 11:24.476
I'm gonna try, and I
really hope it pays off.

11:27.409 --> 11:30.740
I've never really sat down
and talked with you about it.

11:30.740 --> 11:33.091
So what do you think?

11:33.091 --> 11:35.551
- Well, I think you shouldn't.

11:35.551 --> 11:40.091
Look, Jay, this whole thing
is your responsibility,

11:40.091 --> 11:41.674
whatever "this" is.

11:42.682 --> 11:44.195
- So you don't think it'll work?

11:44.195 --> 11:45.643
- No.

11:45.643 --> 11:46.811
- Thanks, Mark.

11:46.811 --> 11:49.638
- Hey, we're best friends.

11:49.638 --> 11:51.721
You know, I have to hope.

11:54.025 --> 11:55.595
Have you found any kids yet?

11:55.595 --> 11:56.428
- One.

11:57.456 --> 12:00.792
But I don't know how qualified he is.

12:00.792 --> 12:04.160
- He's a kid, he's not
supposed to be qualified.

12:04.160 --> 12:09.160
How could you even be qualified
for something like this?

12:09.317 --> 12:10.150
Who is it?

12:11.299 --> 12:12.766
- Sam Johnson's son.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.636
- Really?
- Kyle.

12:14.636 --> 12:15.469
- Kyle.

12:17.258 --> 12:18.488
His dad always reminded me of more

12:18.488 --> 12:19.629
of the secretary type.

12:19.629 --> 12:22.962
You know, desk job, tiny little glasses.

12:24.142 --> 12:25.963
- Maybe, but with Sam being an agent,

12:25.963 --> 12:29.322
Kyle already has some basic training.

12:29.322 --> 12:30.454
- Have you contacted him?

12:30.454 --> 12:31.287
- Yeah.

12:34.534 --> 12:38.379
It's just important to
find the right kids.

12:38.379 --> 12:43.002
I'm also concerned about
finding a math teacher.

12:43.002 --> 12:45.330
- Did you talk to Diane?

12:45.330 --> 12:47.111
- Of course,
but I'm already using her

12:47.111 --> 12:48.694
for something else.

12:50.111 --> 12:51.590
- Perhaps...

12:51.590 --> 12:53.981
Studying the female body?

12:56.191 --> 12:57.024
- No.

12:58.722 --> 13:02.495
No, I meant she'll be teaching history.

13:02.495 --> 13:03.580
I have an interview lined up tomorrow

13:03.580 --> 13:08.122
with a potential candidate
from outside the agency.

13:08.122 --> 13:10.372
- Is that a good idea?

13:10.372 --> 13:11.637
Does Harrison know?

13:11.637 --> 13:14.060
- Does he need to know?

13:14.060 --> 13:15.984
He already somewhat supports
my idea for the program,

13:15.984 --> 13:17.962
which means that as
long as it's successful,

13:17.962 --> 13:20.462
I have nothing to worry about.

13:21.332 --> 13:22.165
- Hm.

13:24.211 --> 13:26.977
Yeah but for reals, you would
be all over that class though.

13:26.977 --> 13:28.200
- Hell yeah.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.701
- I can see it now.

13:29.701 --> 13:31.118
Diane's Body 101.

13:33.849 --> 13:35.850
You should ask her out.

13:35.850 --> 13:37.433
- Hell no.

13:40.098 --> 13:42.405
- So yes, I really like math.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.327
I mean, there's just so
much you can do with it.

13:44.327 --> 13:46.056
It being math, you know, just math.

13:46.056 --> 13:48.276
Addition, multiplication,
division, subtraction.

13:48.276 --> 13:50.026
So yeah, I like math.

13:50.875 --> 13:52.538
Do you want to see my calculator?

13:52.538 --> 13:53.878
- Not right now.

13:53.878 --> 13:55.879
Tell me about some jobs
you've previously had.

13:55.879 --> 13:58.711
- Well, I was a student.

13:58.711 --> 13:59.999
I mean, I don't know if that counts.

13:59.999 --> 14:01.250
I mean, I think it should count,

14:01.250 --> 14:03.694
because it was very, very hard.

14:03.694 --> 14:04.527
- No.

14:05.438 --> 14:07.460
- Very hard.

14:07.460 --> 14:09.178
- Being in school doesn't count.

14:09.178 --> 14:14.020
Didn't you at least work at,
I don't know, Burger King?

14:14.020 --> 14:16.580
It says so on the application
you provided me with.

14:16.580 --> 14:17.413
- Once.

14:18.380 --> 14:19.380
- That's it?

14:20.358 --> 14:22.775
You have nothing else to say?

14:23.684 --> 14:27.580
- I enjoyed giving customers
their change, because math.

14:27.580 --> 14:28.799
- I'm just a little
concerned that you won't

14:28.799 --> 14:30.797
be mature enough to handle teenagers.

14:30.797 --> 14:32.780
I need my teachers to be strict,

14:32.780 --> 14:35.239
and willing to discipline the
foreign exchange students.

14:35.239 --> 14:36.359
You know?

14:36.359 --> 14:37.319
- I understand.

14:37.319 --> 14:38.152
Hey, you shut your mouth,

14:38.152 --> 14:39.388
before I staple it shut.

14:39.388 --> 14:41.799
This is a classroom, and
you will learn to sit.

14:41.799 --> 14:42.868
Oh, what's that?

14:42.868 --> 14:44.508
I need to glue your ass to the seat?

14:44.508 --> 14:45.460
Cause I will.

14:45.460 --> 14:46.293
Alright?

14:46.293 --> 14:48.610
I'm not afraid to get
your mother involved.

14:48.610 --> 14:49.918
I have the authority to keep you here

14:49.918 --> 14:53.940
til after four, and I'm
not afraid to use it.

14:53.940 --> 14:55.460
- Hey, Brandon, whoa.

14:55.460 --> 14:56.708
Calm down a bit.

14:58.028 --> 14:59.399
- Don't worry about that.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.893
If you look up calm in the dictionary,

15:00.893 --> 15:02.469
it's just a big picture of this

15:02.469 --> 15:03.302
right up in there.

15:03.302 --> 15:04.135
- I see.

15:04.135 --> 15:04.968
- Heh.

15:04.968 --> 15:06.578
That was just a demonstration
of how tough I could be.

15:06.578 --> 15:08.578
Education is not a joke.

15:09.490 --> 15:10.778
- Is there an illness I should be aware of

15:10.778 --> 15:12.218
before offering you the job?

15:12.218 --> 15:13.885
Say, maybe bi-polar?

15:16.698 --> 15:17.531
- Nope.

15:24.019 --> 15:24.852
- Okay.

15:26.909 --> 15:28.520
Congratulations.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.699
I've received no other applications,

15:30.699 --> 15:34.011
so looks like you'll be getting the job.

15:34.011 --> 15:34.844
- Say it.

15:35.759 --> 15:37.510
- The job of math teacher.

15:37.510 --> 15:39.739
- Yeah, I'm so excited about math.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.406
- I know you are.

15:41.406 --> 15:43.222
Welcome to the team, Brandon Barve.

15:43.222 --> 15:45.990
Go ahead and help yourself out, thanks.

15:45.990 --> 15:46.823
- Oh.

15:48.121 --> 15:48.954
Okay.

17:23.963 --> 17:24.796
- Hello?

17:25.915 --> 17:27.451
Is someone there?

17:33.614 --> 17:34.447
Hey you!

17:46.149 --> 17:47.501
Are you stealing from me?

17:47.501 --> 17:48.334
- What?

17:48.334 --> 17:49.651
No, I'm just lost.

17:49.651 --> 17:52.149
- Lost, in my house.

17:52.149 --> 17:54.731
- It's a nice house, man.

17:54.731 --> 17:57.669
- Did my credit card just
fall out of your pocket, man?

17:57.669 --> 17:58.966
- You can keep it.

17:58.966 --> 18:00.029
I prefer bills.

18:00.029 --> 18:01.196
- Not so fast.

18:04.296 --> 18:06.629
What the hell just happened?

18:28.244 --> 18:30.327
So what's your name, kid?

18:31.184 --> 18:32.999
You got a name or what?

18:32.999 --> 18:35.002
- Trevor Doyle.

18:35.002 --> 18:35.835
- Trevor.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.316
Trevor, I'm Jay.

18:39.268 --> 18:41.444
What are you doing here?

18:41.444 --> 18:43.232
- Just looking for money.

18:43.232 --> 18:45.519
Trying to get by, you know?

18:45.519 --> 18:46.993
- You on your own?

18:46.993 --> 18:48.513
- Yes.

18:48.513 --> 18:49.346
- Yes.

18:50.244 --> 18:51.214
That's all I get?

18:51.214 --> 18:52.385
- Look, I've been on the streets

18:52.385 --> 18:54.644
for about as long as I can remember.

18:54.644 --> 18:57.534
- I'm sorry to hear that.

18:57.534 --> 19:00.582
So, where'd you learn to fight like that?

19:00.582 --> 19:01.693
- Around, I guess.

19:01.693 --> 19:02.526
- Around?

19:03.783 --> 19:04.616
Really?

19:05.453 --> 19:06.714
I don't buy it.

19:06.714 --> 19:08.493
- I have to protect myself.

19:08.493 --> 19:11.533
There's a lot of messed
up things in this world.

19:11.533 --> 19:13.962
- There's a lot of good too.

19:13.962 --> 19:14.795
- Maybe.

19:17.992 --> 19:19.639
- Do you need a place to stay for a while?

19:19.639 --> 19:20.472
- Look...

19:22.071 --> 19:24.161
Are you serious?

19:24.161 --> 19:25.078
- I get it.

19:26.144 --> 19:27.535
You don't know me.

19:27.535 --> 19:28.368
I get it.

19:30.032 --> 19:32.615
I had a rough childhood myself.

19:33.825 --> 19:35.008
But once I got my life together,

19:35.008 --> 19:36.386
I promised I'd always help those

19:36.386 --> 19:38.303
less fortunate than me.

19:39.807 --> 19:41.304
I wish I had someone I could really trust

19:41.304 --> 19:42.971
when I was your age.

19:44.997 --> 19:46.746
- I know what you mean.

19:46.746 --> 19:50.952
- This might sound crazy,
but I work for Section 62.

19:50.952 --> 19:52.023
We're starting up a new program

19:52.023 --> 19:54.293
that you'd be a perfect fit for.

19:54.293 --> 19:56.664
- Is that like, CIA?

19:56.664 --> 19:57.903
- We're a special
service that branched out

19:57.903 --> 20:00.321
from the CIA in the late 70s.

20:00.321 --> 20:03.571
We operate outside the normal protocol.

20:04.982 --> 20:07.464
- How hard did I hit you?

20:07.464 --> 20:10.293
- About as hard as I hit you.

20:10.293 --> 20:13.293
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

20:19.654 --> 20:22.064
He's out there if you want to meet him.

20:22.064 --> 20:24.413
- This homeless kid of yours...

20:24.413 --> 20:25.493
He's just locked up in the garage

20:25.493 --> 20:26.602
like a wild animal?

20:26.602 --> 20:28.432
- If by homeless kid you mean prodigy?

20:28.432 --> 20:29.752
Yes.

20:29.752 --> 20:32.306
Calm down, I'm still trying
to figure everything out.

20:32.306 --> 20:34.846
- Did you feed it, him?

20:34.846 --> 20:36.176
- Of course.

20:42.701 --> 20:44.118
- So, he hit you?

20:45.201 --> 20:46.161
I heard he actually hit you.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.029
- We're not gonna talk about this.

20:58.466 --> 20:59.325
- Hey.

20:59.325 --> 21:00.375
- You must be Kyle.

21:00.375 --> 21:01.255
- Yup.

21:01.255 --> 21:02.156
- Come on in.

21:02.156 --> 21:03.277
- Thanks.

21:03.277 --> 21:04.694
- Sup little man.

21:07.435 --> 21:08.393
- Wow, it's a nice house.

21:08.393 --> 21:09.770
- Don't be like that, he's not five.

21:09.770 --> 21:10.603
- What?

21:10.603 --> 21:11.754
- Little man?

21:11.754 --> 21:12.893
No.

21:12.893 --> 21:14.143
- Kids love me.

21:21.594 --> 21:23.386
- Good afternoon.

21:23.386 --> 21:25.376
So, we'll start with this.

21:25.376 --> 21:27.026
We'll call it the bulletin board.

21:27.026 --> 21:30.112
You will need to become
very familiar with it.

21:30.112 --> 21:32.416
This section here is for scheduling.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.746
Teachers and students,

21:33.746 --> 21:36.134
it'll have your class
call times for the week.

21:36.134 --> 21:37.885
In other words, where you need to be,

21:37.885 --> 21:40.136
and what time you need to be there.

21:40.136 --> 21:42.485
Please check the board
at least twice a day.

21:42.485 --> 21:43.554
I'll be making changes,

21:43.554 --> 21:45.064
and also be posting up when meetings

21:45.064 --> 21:48.165
and special activities take place.

21:48.165 --> 21:50.005
So, let's get the tour started.

21:50.005 --> 21:51.765
But first, please come take a look

21:51.765 --> 21:53.664
at what I've already posted up here.

21:53.664 --> 21:56.071
- Only two hours a day for math?

21:56.071 --> 21:57.350
According to my calculations, yeah,

21:57.350 --> 21:59.002
that equals bullshit.

21:59.002 --> 22:00.224
At the first meeting, I plan to--

22:00.224 --> 22:02.122
- Save it for the meeting.

22:02.122 --> 22:03.763
- I'm Diane, I don't believe we've met.

22:03.763 --> 22:05.194
- Oh, well...

22:05.194 --> 22:06.933
That's because we haven't.

22:06.933 --> 22:08.213
You know, during business hours,

22:08.213 --> 22:09.413
you should call me Mr. Barve,

22:09.413 --> 22:11.794
but any other time, I'm Brandon.

22:12.925 --> 22:14.144
Oh, and you squeeze hard.

22:14.144 --> 22:15.314
I like that.

22:15.314 --> 22:16.685
- It's nice to meet you, Mr. Barve.

22:16.685 --> 22:18.125
- Yeah, I'm just trying to put this sched

22:18.125 --> 22:19.556
into my calculator here.

22:19.556 --> 22:22.065
Do you want to see my calculator?

22:22.065 --> 22:24.148
- Wow, Jay, this is nice.

22:25.925 --> 22:27.626
- Welcome to headquarters.

22:27.626 --> 22:28.995
I'll be showing you the trainees,

22:28.995 --> 22:32.078
students' dormitories and classrooms.

22:35.654 --> 22:37.494
In front here, is A4.

22:37.494 --> 22:38.745
- Oh, A4 is my classroom.

22:38.745 --> 22:39.614
Ah, yeah.

22:39.614 --> 22:41.116
So, I was looking over your somewhat

22:41.116 --> 22:42.286
of a letdown bulletin board--

22:42.286 --> 22:43.854
- Shut up.

22:43.854 --> 22:44.687
Yes, okay.

22:45.665 --> 22:47.319
Moving on.

22:57.633 --> 22:59.124
In here is A3.

22:59.124 --> 23:03.624
Rachelle, this is where
you'll be teaching literature.

23:05.572 --> 23:09.405
- I'm very strict, prepare
to read many books.

23:12.141 --> 23:13.757
- I hate reading.

23:13.757 --> 23:14.858
- I like math.

23:14.858 --> 23:17.416
- And down this hall is A2.

23:17.416 --> 23:19.147
History, I believe that's you, Diane.

23:19.147 --> 23:20.618
- Sounds great.

23:20.618 --> 23:22.218
- We have bedroom one and bedroom two.

23:22.218 --> 23:23.597
Trevor and Kyle, I'll let you two choose

23:23.597 --> 23:24.688
who gets what room.

23:24.688 --> 23:25.877
- Oh, Kyle.

23:25.877 --> 23:28.044
Pick this room, it's nice.

23:29.309 --> 23:30.288
- I'm Trevor.

23:30.288 --> 23:31.121
- Oh.

23:31.121 --> 23:32.778
Kyle, pick this room.

23:32.778 --> 23:35.435
- Okay, I guess I'll take that room.

23:35.435 --> 23:36.794
- Is that okay, Trevor?

23:36.794 --> 23:38.018
- Yeah, I don't care.

23:38.018 --> 23:39.725
As long as it's not the garage.

23:39.725 --> 23:40.959
- That was easy.

23:40.959 --> 23:43.209
And last, A1, my classroom.

23:56.508 --> 23:59.189
- Hm, and what do you teach, my good man?

23:59.189 --> 24:00.532
- Technology.

24:00.532 --> 24:01.921
Computer stuff.

24:01.921 --> 24:02.932
- Stuff?

24:02.932 --> 24:04.521
I mean, it's pretty big in here.

24:04.521 --> 24:05.846
- It's just a room.

24:05.846 --> 24:07.241
- You could fit Jupiter in here.

24:07.241 --> 24:08.074
- It's not--

24:08.074 --> 24:09.407
- It's enormous!

24:10.519 --> 24:11.352
- Alright.

24:12.260 --> 24:14.641
Outside we'll be doing P.E.

24:14.641 --> 24:16.019
Mark will be your coach.

24:16.019 --> 24:18.801
At this time, there will
be no further questions.

24:18.801 --> 24:21.491
- Uh, but I didn't get to
ask any of my questions.

24:21.491 --> 24:22.651
- Hey Barve.

24:22.651 --> 24:24.670
Shut up and let Jay talk.

24:24.670 --> 24:26.070
- Sorry, coach.

24:26.070 --> 24:27.110
- Before wrapping up the tour,

24:27.110 --> 24:29.332
I want to cover some rules.

24:29.332 --> 24:30.921
Teachers, you are all required to be here

24:30.921 --> 24:33.892
9 AM to 9 PM, Monday through Thursday.

24:33.892 --> 24:35.109
Friday will be a short day,

24:35.109 --> 24:36.870
and only Mark needs to be here.

24:36.870 --> 24:37.961
Saturday on the other hand,

24:37.961 --> 24:39.740
will be a 24 hour day.

24:39.740 --> 24:43.012
You're all required to be here
9 AM to 9 AM Sunday morning.

24:43.012 --> 24:43.870
- Uh, yeah.

24:43.870 --> 24:46.041
I didn't sign up for this.

24:46.041 --> 24:47.510
- A few restrictions.

24:47.510 --> 24:49.292
The lights will go out 10 PM every night

24:49.292 --> 24:51.170
except for Saturday, of course.

24:51.170 --> 24:53.241
Under no circumstance is a guest allowed

24:53.241 --> 24:54.880
in this house.

24:54.880 --> 24:57.281
And my room is strictly off limits.

24:57.281 --> 24:58.829
- Oh, what's in there?

24:58.829 --> 25:01.079
- I said no more questions.

25:02.721 --> 25:04.939
I'll see you all tomorrow morning.

25:12.003 --> 25:12.836
Up!

25:12.836 --> 25:14.672
Let's go, everyone up!

25:14.672 --> 25:16.613
Get up, let's go, let's go!

25:16.613 --> 25:17.613
Everyone up!

25:22.693 --> 25:24.773
- I'm here, Mr. Jay, sir.

25:24.773 --> 25:26.997
- Hey Kyle.

25:26.997 --> 25:28.426
You look ready to ready to tackle

25:28.426 --> 25:30.866
anything I could possibly throw at you.

25:30.866 --> 25:32.226
Meaning of course, you couldn't possibly

25:32.226 --> 25:34.066
look any more tired if you tried.

25:34.066 --> 25:36.125
- No, I'm ready.

25:36.125 --> 25:37.708
- Come grab a seat.

25:39.215 --> 25:40.645
That's your laptop.

25:40.645 --> 25:44.115
Please, take notes in every class.

25:44.115 --> 25:45.795
There will be many tests.

25:45.795 --> 25:49.515
Unfortunately, even a test needs tests.

25:49.515 --> 25:51.154
So you know, Mr. Barve is not an agent,

25:51.154 --> 25:52.894
so we don't necessarily want him knowing

25:52.894 --> 25:55.216
exactly what we do in here.

25:55.216 --> 25:56.965
I'll be teaching you
and Trevor weapons tech

25:56.965 --> 25:59.347
and government secrets.

25:59.347 --> 26:02.483
At different times, and
occasionally one on one.

26:02.483 --> 26:03.934
Make sense?

26:03.934 --> 26:04.767
- Yeah.

26:04.767 --> 26:08.104
- Heh, I know the perfect
way to wake you up.

26:08.104 --> 26:10.524
I could show you pictures
from inside of Area 51,

26:10.524 --> 26:13.135
or maybe you would like to listen to the

26:13.135 --> 26:16.365
missing 18 and a half minutes
of the Watergate tapes.

26:16.365 --> 26:18.715
After that, I could explain to you why

26:18.715 --> 26:21.633
Atlantis is really hidden.

26:21.633 --> 26:22.805
- I think I'm awake now.

26:22.805 --> 26:25.485
Oh, that sounds incredible.

26:25.485 --> 26:26.896
- Our government has kept many secrets

26:26.896 --> 26:28.955
from its citizens.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.864
Some are terrible things.

26:30.864 --> 26:33.123
And some are truly the benefit to country.

26:33.123 --> 26:36.275
- And you're gonna tell
me about these things

26:36.275 --> 26:37.925
with pictures?

26:37.925 --> 26:38.758
I'm in.

26:38.758 --> 26:40.472
- These things are an important part

26:40.472 --> 26:41.732
of understanding our country

26:41.732 --> 26:44.353
and how we operate today as a whole.

26:44.353 --> 26:45.493
The truth is, there's many things

26:45.493 --> 26:47.634
that I don't even know.

26:47.634 --> 26:49.075
But that doesn't matter.

26:49.075 --> 26:50.075
- It doesn't?

26:50.075 --> 26:51.664
- No.

26:51.664 --> 26:53.144
What does matter is how we,

26:53.144 --> 26:56.445
again as a whole, handle this information.

26:56.445 --> 26:57.504
You see, the way the world works

26:57.504 --> 26:59.314
is vastly different than a hundred

26:59.314 --> 27:01.635
or even just 50 years ago.

27:01.635 --> 27:04.133
We have internet, podcasts, emails,

27:04.133 --> 27:06.635
smartphones, and so much more.

27:06.635 --> 27:09.331
That it's important on how
this information is stored,

27:09.331 --> 27:10.248
and by who.

27:11.563 --> 27:14.123
If I tell you something
and you tell someone,

27:14.123 --> 27:17.755
you just doubled the
amount of people who know.

27:17.755 --> 27:20.928
But if you say, post
something on your blog,

27:20.928 --> 27:22.719
then millions can see it within hours,

27:22.719 --> 27:24.968
or possibly minutes.

27:24.968 --> 27:26.307
- Yeah, yeah, I understand.

27:26.307 --> 27:28.308
You want me to be careful
with the material,

27:28.308 --> 27:29.707
I can't just tell my friends

27:29.707 --> 27:31.220
what I did at school today.

27:31.220 --> 27:32.668
- That's right.

27:32.668 --> 27:34.059
But the purpose of this class isn't just

27:34.059 --> 27:36.239
to learn cool government secrets,

27:36.239 --> 27:40.508
but why they're a secret
in the first place.

27:40.508 --> 27:42.091
Open your textbook.

27:43.199 --> 27:44.679
Page 13.

27:58.585 --> 27:59.687
- Good morning, Trevor.

27:59.687 --> 28:00.783
I'm Mark.

28:00.783 --> 28:02.796
That way we can say we've officially met.

28:02.796 --> 28:04.367
- Trevor.

28:04.367 --> 28:06.396
- I will be your coach
and physical educator,

28:06.396 --> 28:08.465
but more importantly and more fun,

28:08.465 --> 28:10.607
your martial arts instructor.

28:10.607 --> 28:12.679
I've studied many
different forms including

28:12.679 --> 28:15.647
jiu-jitsu, kickboxing, and even fencing.

28:15.647 --> 28:16.927
You could say that I'm
the most skilled fighter

28:16.927 --> 28:18.677
in the United States.

28:19.577 --> 28:22.159
Jay would disagree, but
he's yet to actually

28:22.159 --> 28:23.659
beat me in a spar.

28:24.767 --> 28:26.481
- You're serious?

28:26.481 --> 28:27.385
- About?

28:27.385 --> 28:28.218
- All this?

28:28.218 --> 28:32.185
I mean, no offense, but
you're not very muscly.

28:32.185 --> 28:33.497
- Oh, kid.

28:33.497 --> 28:34.857
Size isn't everything.

28:34.857 --> 28:37.745
Knowledge and practice
are far more important.

28:37.745 --> 28:39.225
- If you say so, pal.

28:39.225 --> 28:41.794
- I heard you gave Jay
a run for his money.

28:41.794 --> 28:42.716
Let's see what you can do.

28:42.716 --> 28:44.299
- It was just luck.

28:45.733 --> 28:47.123
- I'll walk you through it.

28:47.123 --> 28:48.655
- You want me to fight you?

28:48.655 --> 28:49.488
- Yeah.

28:50.815 --> 28:51.893
- Okay.

28:51.893 --> 28:53.976
Let's get this over with.

28:56.082 --> 28:59.415
- Bend your knees, you're way too stiff.

29:01.944 --> 29:04.715
Keep your balance, don't lose focus.

29:04.715 --> 29:07.414
- What does that even mean?

29:07.414 --> 29:08.883
- It means don't put
yourself in a situation

29:08.883 --> 29:10.966
you're not in control of.

29:15.049 --> 29:18.182
I have the upper hand if you fall down.

29:18.182 --> 29:19.099
- You suck.

29:23.080 --> 29:24.830
- So don't fall down.

29:26.728 --> 29:27.811
Not bad, kid.

29:33.891 --> 29:34.891
- Hey buddy!

29:36.688 --> 29:38.207
- Don't do that.

29:38.207 --> 29:40.077
- What happened to you?

29:40.077 --> 29:41.226
- I got punched.

29:41.226 --> 29:42.895
- Hard enough to make your nose bleed?

29:42.895 --> 29:45.719
Good Lord, what have I gotten myself into?

29:45.719 --> 29:46.636
- Ah, come on.

29:46.636 --> 29:49.337
We're gonna be late for class.

29:49.337 --> 29:51.087
- Did it hurt?

29:51.965 --> 29:53.239
- Yeah, it did.

29:53.239 --> 29:55.643
But the bleeding finally stopped.

29:55.643 --> 29:57.329
- You're late!

29:57.329 --> 29:58.162
Why?

29:59.007 --> 30:01.507
More so, how is that possible?

30:03.106 --> 30:04.745
- I got hurt.

30:04.745 --> 30:05.886
- I don't care.

30:05.886 --> 30:06.719
Sit down!

30:08.882 --> 30:09.715
- Where?

30:09.715 --> 30:10.653
There's no chairs.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.522
- I fooled you.

30:14.522 --> 30:15.933
I removed all the chairs because I think

30:15.933 --> 30:17.093
it's easier to teach a class

30:17.093 --> 30:19.821
that won't fall asleep!

30:19.821 --> 30:22.071
You will stand in my class.

30:29.090 --> 30:30.930
Who do you think you are, Jay-Z?

30:30.930 --> 30:32.570
Stand up!

30:32.570 --> 30:34.386
- Can I just sit for a minute?

30:34.386 --> 30:35.399
Go ahead and start class,

30:35.399 --> 30:37.418
I have a really bad headache.

30:37.418 --> 30:38.287
- You know what?

30:38.287 --> 30:41.926
We will, as soon as you
show me a little respect.

30:41.926 --> 30:42.936
- Look, crazy lady.

30:42.936 --> 30:45.336
I really don't think I'm
doing anything wrong.

30:45.336 --> 30:46.753
- Oh, is that so?

30:48.027 --> 30:49.296
Well, oh, who's the teacher?

30:49.296 --> 30:50.766
It's me!

30:50.766 --> 30:53.336
You will listen to me, if you have ears.

30:53.336 --> 30:54.677
- This is the most ridiculous display

30:54.677 --> 30:56.974
of human I have ever seen.

30:56.974 --> 30:58.446
- That's enough.

30:58.446 --> 31:00.571
You will both receive punishment!

31:00.571 --> 31:02.118
- Punishment?

31:02.118 --> 31:03.976
Okay, what's our punishment?

31:03.976 --> 31:06.296
It can't be any worse than this.

31:06.296 --> 31:07.775
97.

31:07.775 --> 31:08.608
- 94.

31:09.866 --> 31:11.597
- 98.

31:11.597 --> 31:12.430
- 95.

31:13.916 --> 31:16.095
- Have you learned your lesson yet?

31:16.095 --> 31:16.996
Answer me!

31:16.996 --> 31:18.564
- Yes sir!

31:18.564 --> 31:19.996
- I couldn't hear you, let's do 20 more.

31:19.996 --> 31:21.866
- No, please no!

31:21.866 --> 31:23.266
- Quit crying, Kyle.

31:23.266 --> 31:25.724
- If you are ever disrespectful
to a teacher again,

31:25.724 --> 31:28.855
you will be out here until you throw up.

31:28.855 --> 31:30.972
Do I make myself clear?

31:30.972 --> 31:31.805
- Yes.

31:31.805 --> 31:32.638
- Do I?

31:32.638 --> 31:34.303
- Yes!
- Yes!

31:45.015 --> 31:45.983
- Alright.

31:45.983 --> 31:47.150
Any questions?

31:49.253 --> 31:50.764
- What?

31:50.764 --> 31:51.953
- What do you mean what?

31:51.953 --> 31:53.524
- I mean, what?

31:53.524 --> 31:54.673
- What what?

31:54.673 --> 31:57.261
- What he means is what?

31:57.261 --> 31:58.535
- I know what he means is what,

31:58.535 --> 32:01.868
I'm asking what is he asking what about?

32:06.720 --> 32:07.871
As I was saying.

32:07.871 --> 32:09.740
This is all due tomorrow,

32:09.740 --> 32:10.882
so please show your work,

32:10.882 --> 32:14.291
and together we can problem
solve the right way.

32:14.291 --> 32:16.338
- Wait, I don't
know how to do this.

32:16.338 --> 32:18.613
- Yeah, you're supposed to teach us?

32:18.613 --> 32:20.522
- There's examples and
directions on each page.

32:20.522 --> 32:21.355
See?

32:21.355 --> 32:22.511
Right here.

32:25.945 --> 32:27.675
- You want us to do all of this?

32:27.675 --> 32:29.374
It's like 60 pages.

32:29.374 --> 32:30.207
- By tomorrow?

32:30.207 --> 32:31.665
Yes, it'll be fun.

32:31.665 --> 32:33.915
Can't wait to grade it all.

32:37.075 --> 32:38.043
- Alright.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.253
Let's review really
quickly before class ends.

32:40.253 --> 32:41.894
Who was the only president to serve

32:41.894 --> 32:43.561
more than two terms?

32:45.065 --> 32:45.898
Trevor?

32:47.025 --> 32:47.858
- Um...

32:49.851 --> 32:51.653
I can't remember.

32:51.653 --> 32:52.814
- Were you paying attention?

32:52.814 --> 32:53.647
Hello?

32:53.647 --> 32:54.774
Earth to Trevor.

32:54.774 --> 32:55.607
- What?

32:55.607 --> 32:56.813
Yeah, I was.

32:56.813 --> 32:57.646
- Kyle?

32:58.925 --> 32:59.758
- Hm?

33:01.452 --> 33:02.285
Oh.

33:05.098 --> 33:06.598
George Washington?

33:08.300 --> 33:09.699
- Oh, unbelievable.

33:09.699 --> 33:12.449
We literally just went over this.

33:14.408 --> 33:16.431
Are my clothes too revealing?

33:16.431 --> 33:17.264
- No.

33:17.264 --> 33:19.340
- You're young men, I'm a woman.

33:19.340 --> 33:20.551
Is it too much cleavage, what?

33:20.551 --> 33:21.384
- Whoa.

33:21.384 --> 33:22.340
No, no, no, no, no.

33:22.340 --> 33:23.959
- Awkward.

33:23.959 --> 33:25.431
- Trevor.

33:25.431 --> 33:27.008
I can see your eyes.

33:27.008 --> 33:28.494
And where they're looking.

33:28.494 --> 33:29.744
- Sorry, ma'am.

33:32.464 --> 33:34.677
- Maybe wear a jacket
or something next time.

33:34.677 --> 33:37.177
Would you like to borrow mine?

33:38.837 --> 33:39.670
- No.

33:41.747 --> 33:44.483
Alright, I think we'll
end there for the day.

33:44.483 --> 33:46.053
The answer, in case either
of you were wondering,

33:46.053 --> 33:47.970
was Franklin Roosevelt.

33:49.413 --> 33:51.824
You're both clearly struggling

33:51.824 --> 33:53.464
with history from our country's past,

33:53.464 --> 33:55.693
so how about I have
you read a few chapters

33:55.693 --> 33:58.904
in the book and quiz you
on the content tomorrow?

33:58.904 --> 34:01.413
- Okay, Ms. Bayer, we already
have a lot of homework,

34:01.413 --> 34:03.133
could you possibly postpone the quiz

34:03.133 --> 34:04.944
to a later time?

34:04.944 --> 34:06.293
- No.

34:06.293 --> 34:07.302
- Of course you can't.

34:07.302 --> 34:10.121
- This place is trying to kill me.

34:10.121 --> 34:11.228
- Yup.

34:11.228 --> 34:13.478
Actually trying to kill us.

34:18.054 --> 34:20.705
- Have either of you fired a gun before?

34:20.705 --> 34:21.538
- No.

34:21.538 --> 34:22.371
- No.

34:22.371 --> 34:23.204
- Really?

34:24.315 --> 34:25.726
Kyle, you haven't?

34:25.726 --> 34:27.357
- I'm not my dad.

34:27.357 --> 34:29.440
- Okay, let's go over it.

34:30.487 --> 34:32.070
Front sight, slide,

34:33.565 --> 34:36.398
rear sight, muzzle, trigger guard,

34:37.612 --> 34:41.112
trigger, grip, magazine release, magazine.

34:43.413 --> 34:46.013
We use a nine millimeter
semi-automatic pistol,

34:46.013 --> 34:48.234
which means the reload is automatic,

34:48.234 --> 34:49.693
but you still have to pull the trigger

34:49.693 --> 34:51.193
each time to fire.

34:52.405 --> 34:55.514
- Those targets aren't for us, are they?

34:55.514 --> 34:56.431
- They are.

34:57.943 --> 34:59.732
I'll demonstrate.

34:59.732 --> 35:01.714
First, you slide the magazine upward

35:01.714 --> 35:05.253
into the grip until you
hear a clicking sound.

35:05.253 --> 35:08.053
Pull the slide to its rear
most position and release

35:08.053 --> 35:09.636
to chamber a round.

35:14.472 --> 35:15.749
- Dude!

35:15.749 --> 35:17.166
That was awesome!

35:19.851 --> 35:21.442
- Practice makes perfect.

35:21.442 --> 35:22.721
I want you both out here at least

35:22.721 --> 35:24.320
30 minutes every day.

35:24.320 --> 35:25.153
- Yes sir.

35:32.272 --> 35:33.105
Uh.

35:34.291 --> 35:36.041
You want to go first?

35:36.992 --> 35:38.409
- Um, yeah, sure.

35:41.653 --> 35:42.784
- Dude.

35:42.784 --> 35:43.617
- What?

35:49.646 --> 35:50.896
- Stop shaking.

35:53.373 --> 35:54.482
- You know what?

35:54.482 --> 35:55.482
You just go.

35:57.005 --> 35:57.838
- Okay.

36:02.643 --> 36:03.476
- Ah!

36:03.476 --> 36:04.559
It's so loud.

36:06.338 --> 36:08.130
- It's okay, Trevor.

36:08.130 --> 36:08.963
Try again.

36:10.087 --> 36:12.087
- Come on, buddy.

36:18.375 --> 36:19.877
- You can join two clauses with a comma

36:19.877 --> 36:21.546
and a coordinating conjunction.

36:21.546 --> 36:23.074
Body language is non-verbal,

36:23.074 --> 36:25.394
and everyone needs it to communicate.

36:25.394 --> 36:26.957
The correct fix would be...

36:26.957 --> 36:28.875
Body language is non-verbal, comma,

36:28.875 --> 36:30.666
and everyone uses it to communicate.

36:30.666 --> 36:31.499
Questions?

36:32.705 --> 36:33.538
- Um, yeah.

36:33.538 --> 36:34.371
- No!

36:34.371 --> 36:36.237
Good, moving on to prepositions.

36:36.237 --> 36:37.895
A preposition is a relationship between

36:37.895 --> 36:39.477
a noun and a pronoun.

36:39.477 --> 36:40.527
It's mostly used with a noun...

36:40.527 --> 36:41.610
Be quiet!

36:42.917 --> 36:43.887
- No one said anything--

36:43.887 --> 36:45.137
- I said quiet!

36:47.786 --> 36:50.277
A noun to show location like beside,

36:50.277 --> 36:51.837
in, or on.

36:51.837 --> 36:54.535
It can also be used to show motion,

36:54.535 --> 36:57.952
emotion, direction, location, possession.

37:02.125 --> 37:03.616
- Roger that.

37:03.616 --> 37:04.907
Understood.

37:04.907 --> 37:05.824
I gotta go.

37:08.747 --> 37:10.414
Where's your laptop?

37:14.550 --> 37:15.941
- Aw, crap.

37:15.941 --> 37:17.893
I think I left it in Bayer's class.

37:17.893 --> 37:19.741
Wait, where's your hat?

37:19.741 --> 37:20.693
- Forget about it,

37:20.693 --> 37:22.860
let's go grab your laptop.

37:29.229 --> 37:30.397
Sorry, Diane.

37:30.397 --> 37:31.805
- It's okay.

37:31.805 --> 37:33.496
Did you need something?

37:33.496 --> 37:35.264
- Trevor left
his laptop in there.

37:35.264 --> 37:36.866
- I see it.

37:36.866 --> 37:38.575
- What were you doing in there?

37:38.575 --> 37:40.077
I didn't mean to interrupt.

37:40.077 --> 37:41.386
- Don't worry about it.

37:41.386 --> 37:45.356
I've been dressing a little
more modestly for class.

37:45.356 --> 37:46.996
I think I'm a walking
distraction for the boys,

37:46.996 --> 37:49.636
but after class I do like to change.

37:49.636 --> 37:51.206
- Way to go, you're making
her feel uncomfortable.

37:51.206 --> 37:52.345
- Sorry, but have you seen her?

37:52.345 --> 37:53.457
Kind of hard to ignore.

37:53.457 --> 37:54.290
- She's not an object!

37:54.290 --> 37:55.313
- I said I'm sorry!

37:55.313 --> 37:56.146
- For the record,

37:56.146 --> 37:57.196
it wasn't easy to close that door.

37:57.198 --> 37:59.865
- For the record, my head hurts.

38:01.954 --> 38:02.937
- Here you go, bud.

38:02.937 --> 38:04.486
- Thanks, Ms. Bayer.

38:04.486 --> 38:06.324
- Thanks Diane.

38:06.324 --> 38:07.657
- So, it's late.

38:08.596 --> 38:09.825
I was gonna get a drink.

38:09.825 --> 38:11.193
You wanna come?

38:11.193 --> 38:12.425
- That would be lovely.

38:12.425 --> 38:14.592
Maybe after weapons class.

38:18.783 --> 38:20.652
- Dude, she's so into you.

38:20.652 --> 38:21.964
- Come on, we have class.

38:21.964 --> 38:22.943
- Go for it, man.

38:22.943 --> 38:24.194
Love is worth any risk.

38:24.194 --> 38:25.221
- What are you, a fortune cookie?

38:25.221 --> 38:26.054
Come on!

38:26.054 --> 38:27.554
- I'm just saying.

38:33.217 --> 38:37.201
- Hurry up, I expect
two miles in 30 minutes.

38:37.201 --> 38:39.221
- I'm crying on the inside.

38:39.221 --> 38:40.823
- That's sweat, Kyle.

38:40.823 --> 38:41.761
Not tears.

38:41.761 --> 38:44.721
- No, the tears, the tears on the inside,

38:44.721 --> 38:46.948
I'm crying on the inside.

38:46.948 --> 38:48.448
- Then suck it up.

38:52.137 --> 38:52.970
- Hi.

38:52.970 --> 38:54.696
- Hey, Diane.

38:54.696 --> 38:57.446
Wow, you look dressed to impress.

38:58.639 --> 39:00.399
- I'm getting drinks with Jay later.

39:00.399 --> 39:02.247
Hopefully, anyway.

39:02.247 --> 39:03.622
- You have got to be the two most

39:03.622 --> 39:06.337
stubborn people I've ever met.

39:07.428 --> 39:08.289
- Excuse me?

39:08.289 --> 39:09.122
- Hey, get up.

39:09.122 --> 39:10.347
You're gonna finish this run.

39:10.347 --> 39:11.180
Look.

39:12.228 --> 39:13.519
Jay's probably never going to admit

39:13.519 --> 39:14.958
he's attracted to you.

39:14.958 --> 39:16.297
He's a workaholic, and that probably

39:16.297 --> 39:17.797
won't ever change.

39:19.137 --> 39:22.397
- I'm just trying to give him some space.

39:22.397 --> 39:24.117
- Do you hear yourself?

39:24.117 --> 39:24.950
Space.

39:26.108 --> 39:27.647
Why are you being so stubborn?

39:27.647 --> 39:29.685
Just tell him how you feel.

39:29.685 --> 39:30.518
- Page 45.

39:36.324 --> 39:37.157
Page 45.

39:43.082 --> 39:47.653
Believe what you want,
but time travel is real.

39:47.653 --> 39:51.264
It's possible because of this device.

39:51.264 --> 39:52.654
The Shatter Stick.

39:52.654 --> 39:54.585
- The Shatter Stick?

39:54.585 --> 39:57.254
- In late 2012, towards
the end of World War Three,

39:57.254 --> 39:58.745
the Canadians decide to give us a hand

39:58.745 --> 39:59.723
with a new weapon.

39:59.723 --> 40:01.475
- I'm gonna slow you
down there for a minute.

40:01.475 --> 40:02.654
World War Three?

40:02.654 --> 40:04.094
Did you say Canada?

40:04.094 --> 40:05.574
- I did.

40:05.574 --> 40:08.643
World War Three was fought
over a two year period.

40:08.643 --> 40:09.974
The main reason the war happened

40:09.974 --> 40:11.681
was due to hacking.

40:11.681 --> 40:14.075
I say World War Three, but
I'm aware that most people

40:14.075 --> 40:17.923
such as yourself didn't even
know the war took place.

40:17.923 --> 40:21.555
- This is the most I've
learned at any school, ever.

40:21.555 --> 40:22.638
- Take notes.

40:25.523 --> 40:27.315
Blueprints for a new
weapon of mass destruction

40:27.315 --> 40:28.905
were stolen by Russia,

40:28.905 --> 40:31.574
who wanted to sell them
on the black market.

40:31.574 --> 40:33.142
Because the state of
the world at this time,

40:33.142 --> 40:34.494
government leaders thought it was best

40:34.494 --> 40:38.163
to handle the situation
without causing alarm.

40:38.163 --> 40:39.555
Once the weapon was manufactured,

40:39.555 --> 40:42.454
it was found out that
there was a severe glitch.

40:42.454 --> 40:44.855
Every single time the
weapon was powered on,

40:44.855 --> 40:47.187
the operator would disappear.

40:47.187 --> 40:48.826
Still, scientists kept working on it

40:48.826 --> 40:50.665
and making modifications.

40:50.665 --> 40:52.995
Soon, objects and people near the weapon

40:52.995 --> 40:55.225
would disappear when it was turned on.

40:55.225 --> 40:57.734
After the war ended, agents
working with the United States

40:57.734 --> 41:00.083
were given the blueprints
to experiment with it,

41:00.083 --> 41:02.054
and we created this.

41:02.054 --> 41:03.875
The Shatter Stick.

41:03.875 --> 41:05.694
Shatter stands for...

41:05.694 --> 41:09.777
Space Harnessing And Time
Travel Enabling Remote.

41:11.115 --> 41:13.665
It was designed to slice time itself.

41:13.665 --> 41:15.003
- I can't believe it.

41:15.003 --> 41:16.823
And who would've guessed Canada.

41:16.823 --> 41:19.504
- I currently own one
of four that were built.

41:19.504 --> 41:20.843
There's an instruction manual framed

41:20.843 --> 41:23.123
down the back hall that I helped write.

41:23.123 --> 41:26.574
As you could see, this device
has many knobs and buttons.

41:28.334 --> 41:32.443
Don't be shocked, but time
travel's slightly complicated.

41:32.443 --> 41:33.670
- Of course.

41:33.670 --> 41:35.544
- I'll be going into more
detail on the Shatter Stick,

41:35.544 --> 41:38.573
as well as discussing
quantum entanglement.

41:38.573 --> 41:39.406
Once I get clearance,

41:39.406 --> 41:41.476
we'll also be going on
a few field trips too.

41:41.476 --> 41:42.695
- That's amazing.

41:42.695 --> 41:44.956
Uh, can I have your autograph?

41:44.956 --> 41:46.095
- Maybe later.

41:46.095 --> 41:47.615
Right now we're moving on to napalm,

41:47.615 --> 41:48.684
so I need you to pay attention

41:48.684 --> 41:49.724
and take good notes.

41:49.724 --> 41:50.557
- Oh, I am.

41:50.557 --> 41:51.694
Would you like to check and sign off

41:51.694 --> 41:53.143
on my paper, for approval?

41:53.143 --> 41:54.335
- Trevor...

41:54.335 --> 41:57.884
I'll sign your paper later, I promise.

41:57.884 --> 42:00.045
Napalm is a flammable liquid.

42:00.045 --> 42:02.086
It's a mixture of a gelling agent,

42:02.086 --> 42:04.753
and a gasoline, or similar fuel.

42:08.636 --> 42:10.864
- Why do you trust me?

42:10.864 --> 42:12.516
- Excuse me?

42:12.516 --> 42:15.407
- You trusted me right after
I tried stealing from you.

42:15.407 --> 42:16.506
How?

42:16.506 --> 42:18.339
- I saw myself in you.

42:31.396 --> 42:32.985
Sorry, I was late.

42:32.985 --> 42:34.195
- It's okay.

42:34.195 --> 42:35.327
I'm just glad you're here.

42:35.327 --> 42:36.160
- Me too.

42:41.128 --> 42:42.171
Did you make this?

42:42.171 --> 42:43.742
- Yeah.

42:43.742 --> 42:45.525
A little strong, sorry.

42:45.525 --> 42:46.595
- It's really good.

42:46.595 --> 42:47.595
- Thank you.

42:48.567 --> 42:50.338
- Can I ask you something?

42:50.338 --> 42:51.455
- Sure.

42:51.455 --> 42:52.685
- I'm thinking about adding a third agent

42:52.685 --> 42:53.917
to the program.

42:53.917 --> 42:55.295
- Another kid?

42:55.295 --> 42:57.045
- Yeah, maybe a girl.

42:58.163 --> 42:59.557
So, what do you think?

42:59.557 --> 43:01.426
- I think it's a great idea.

43:01.426 --> 43:03.956
You know, I was only 19 when I started.

43:03.956 --> 43:05.666
- You got me beat by a year.

43:05.666 --> 43:06.499
I was 20.

43:07.346 --> 43:08.535
Seems like ages ago.

43:08.535 --> 43:09.864
- No.

43:09.864 --> 43:12.735
I remember my first day
like it was yesterday.

43:12.735 --> 43:15.066
I got there early and was
just about to sit down,

43:15.066 --> 43:16.866
and you come running through the door

43:16.866 --> 43:18.855
like you've got a pack of wolves on you.

43:18.855 --> 43:20.145
And your face is all bloody,

43:20.145 --> 43:21.845
and your shirt is torn.

43:21.845 --> 43:24.040
- That was the day of my
first fight with Pyro Ed.

43:24.040 --> 43:26.065
- First of many, yeah.

43:26.065 --> 43:27.066
- You remember that?

43:27.066 --> 43:27.899
- Mhm.

43:28.786 --> 43:30.236
You ran right past me,

43:30.236 --> 43:31.069
and then you turned around

43:31.069 --> 43:32.695
and you had this big smile on your face.

43:32.695 --> 43:35.477
And you said, I'm Jay, you must be new.

43:35.477 --> 43:39.335
And I said I'm Diane, and
then you said hi Diane,

43:39.335 --> 43:41.596
don't worry, the first
day's always the hardest.

43:41.596 --> 43:45.365
And then I laughed, and
you said something...

43:58.501 --> 44:01.371
- I heard a rumor you wore
that dress just for me.

44:01.371 --> 44:05.665
- I wore this dress cause
it's easy to take off.

44:16.648 --> 44:18.307
- My whole life I've
always enjoyed reading

44:18.307 --> 44:19.364
and doing schoolwork.

44:19.364 --> 44:21.730
Call me insane, but I
like math and science.

44:21.730 --> 44:22.576
But this?

44:22.576 --> 44:23.725
This is too much!

44:23.725 --> 44:25.014
I can't even focus on one book

44:25.014 --> 44:26.363
cause I have two other books open,

44:26.363 --> 44:27.965
and my brain keeps telling me to read

44:27.965 --> 44:29.256
one sentence at a time,

44:29.256 --> 44:30.576
and then switch books.

44:30.576 --> 44:31.655
Listen to this.

44:31.655 --> 44:33.265
Both I and me are singular pronouns,

44:33.265 --> 44:34.616
which means they're used by one person

44:34.616 --> 44:36.347
to refer to himself or herself.

44:36.347 --> 44:37.877
The cosine of an angle in a right triangle

44:37.877 --> 44:40.677
equals the adjacent side
divided by the hypotenuse.

44:40.677 --> 44:42.226
Jamestown, the first
permanent English settlement

44:42.226 --> 44:43.893
was founded in 1607.

44:45.105 --> 44:47.027
- That's not a very
efficient way to study.

44:47.027 --> 44:48.237
- I can't help it!

44:48.237 --> 44:50.305
- Hey, one at a time.

44:58.047 --> 44:59.508
- Do you ever notice that Mr. Barves name

44:59.508 --> 45:01.419
sounds like Mr. Barf?

45:01.419 --> 45:03.326
- We have to
start calling him that.

45:03.326 --> 45:04.888
Behind his back.

45:04.888 --> 45:06.697
- I'm gonna say it to his face.

45:06.697 --> 45:07.589
Barf.

45:07.589 --> 45:08.422
- Barf.

45:09.255 --> 45:11.139
Hey, let's come up with
nicknames for everyone.

45:11.139 --> 45:13.819
- Yeah.

45:13.819 --> 45:15.067
Dude, I've got one.

45:15.067 --> 45:17.317
Mrs. Zurbur can be Sunshine.

45:18.373 --> 45:19.682
- Wait, why?

45:19.682 --> 45:22.122
- Because she's such a joy
to be around, of course.

45:22.122 --> 45:24.462
- Mark should
have a kung fu master name.

45:24.462 --> 45:25.861
Something that sounds Chinese.

45:25.861 --> 45:26.841
- Is that racist?

45:26.841 --> 45:29.611
- Is calling him Hackawackie Chung racist?

45:29.611 --> 45:32.316
- No, that's brilliant!

45:32.316 --> 45:33.668
What about Ms. Bayer?

45:33.668 --> 45:34.501
- Hm.

45:35.859 --> 45:37.750
How about Pain Killer.

45:37.750 --> 45:38.917
- Pain Killer?

45:40.297 --> 45:41.750
Oh, I get it.

45:41.750 --> 45:42.641
- Yeah, cause she's a pain,

45:42.641 --> 45:44.249
but also has killer good looks.

45:44.249 --> 45:46.977
- Also, Bayer is a pain relief medication.

45:46.977 --> 45:48.089
- True.

45:48.089 --> 45:49.089
I didn't think of that.

45:49.089 --> 45:50.279
And Jay?

45:50.279 --> 45:52.177
- I don't know, Jay's pretty cool.

45:52.177 --> 45:53.010
He's the boss.

45:53.010 --> 45:53.967
- Boss.

45:53.967 --> 45:54.800
I like it.

46:00.319 --> 46:01.418
- Hey, Trevor?

46:01.418 --> 46:02.279
- Yep?

46:02.279 --> 46:04.978
- We're friends, right?

46:04.978 --> 46:06.398
- Uh, I think so.

46:06.398 --> 46:07.231
Yeah, why?

46:08.508 --> 46:09.877
- I just don't have very many friends,

46:09.877 --> 46:12.338
so it's nice to know
that someone has my back.

46:12.338 --> 46:14.210
- Hey, as long as you've got mine.

46:14.210 --> 46:15.348
- Yeah, of course.

46:15.348 --> 46:16.458
If you trust me.

46:16.458 --> 46:18.119
- I'm starting to
understand the entire world

46:18.119 --> 46:19.938
isn't out to get me.

46:19.938 --> 46:21.271
- Yeah, I guess.

46:22.508 --> 46:24.346
I guess it's not easy to trust anyone

46:24.346 --> 46:27.618
when so many people have
let you down in the past.

46:27.618 --> 46:29.451
- I know how you feel.

46:39.388 --> 46:41.048
Uh, there's a lot of cords back there.

46:41.048 --> 46:42.790
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

46:42.790 --> 46:43.623
- Yeah.

46:43.623 --> 46:46.592
Pretty sure I can get an
arcade machine running.

46:46.592 --> 46:49.288
Let's see, just connect these two.

46:49.288 --> 46:50.569
And like that.

46:50.569 --> 46:51.652
Did it do it?

46:53.057 --> 46:55.518
- I think you got it.

46:55.518 --> 46:57.209
- Hey, it lights up.

46:57.209 --> 46:58.042
- Boom!

46:58.042 --> 46:58.875
You did it.

46:58.875 --> 46:59.708
- What did I tell you?

46:59.708 --> 47:00.541
- Atta boy.

47:00.541 --> 47:01.718
Yeah, that's handshake worthy.

47:01.718 --> 47:03.129
♪ Walking down the aisle ♪

47:04.828 --> 47:05.661
- Hey Boss.

47:05.661 --> 47:06.494
- Boss?

47:06.494 --> 47:07.348
- that's your new nickname.

47:07.348 --> 47:09.278
- We came up with some
for all the teachers.

47:09.278 --> 47:10.361
- Is that so?

47:11.217 --> 47:12.208
Let's hear.

47:12.208 --> 47:13.876
- Mr. Barf.

47:13.876 --> 47:15.216
- Wow.

47:15.216 --> 47:16.377
I did not realize the name

47:16.377 --> 47:18.377
sounds so much like barf.

47:19.376 --> 47:22.356
- Mrs. Zurbur is our
little ray of Sunshine.

47:22.356 --> 47:23.947
- Mark is Hackawackie Chung.

47:23.947 --> 47:25.188
- Oh, I get it.

47:26.769 --> 47:29.428
- And Ms. Bayer is Pain Killer.

47:29.428 --> 47:32.329
- She's gonna love that one.

47:32.329 --> 47:34.855
So, what about you guys?

47:34.855 --> 47:35.777
- What about us?

47:35.777 --> 47:37.388
- You need nicknames too.

47:37.388 --> 47:38.766
- Like what?

47:38.766 --> 47:40.518
- Yours should be Pocketman.

47:40.518 --> 47:42.158
- Ew, why?

47:42.158 --> 47:43.526
- Cause every time I do laundry,

47:43.526 --> 47:44.946
your pockets are inside out.

47:44.946 --> 47:45.779
- He's right.

47:45.779 --> 47:46.987
It's like you rip your pockets out

47:46.987 --> 47:48.198
when you take your pants off.

47:48.198 --> 47:49.031
- Fine.

47:49.031 --> 47:51.735
If I'm Pocketman, then you're Cargoboy.

47:51.735 --> 47:52.764
- Cargoboy?

47:52.764 --> 47:54.921
- If we're basing our
nicknames off of pants.

47:54.921 --> 47:56.868
- You do wear cargo shorts a lot.

47:56.868 --> 47:58.004
- Is that a crime?

47:58.004 --> 47:59.308
- Nicknames are so stupid.

47:59.308 --> 48:00.446
- Shut up, Pocketman.

48:00.446 --> 48:01.737
- Shut up, Cargoboy.

48:01.737 --> 48:02.766
- Anyways, I'm going to the store.

48:02.766 --> 48:03.615
You guys need anything?

48:03.615 --> 48:05.236
- Uh, I could use some more cargo shorts.

48:05.236 --> 48:06.953
- The grocery store.

48:06.953 --> 48:08.116
You know what?

48:08.116 --> 48:09.297
Nevermind.

48:09.297 --> 48:11.657
- Can I have a carrot?

48:11.657 --> 48:12.545
- A carrot?

48:12.545 --> 48:13.378
- What?

48:13.378 --> 48:14.211
I'm hungry.

48:14.211 --> 48:15.044
- Seriously?

48:15.044 --> 48:15.877
- Okay, an apple.

48:15.877 --> 48:17.108
Boss, can I have an apple?

48:17.108 --> 48:18.606
- Shut up!

48:18.606 --> 48:19.439
- Sorry.

48:20.613 --> 48:21.446
- Gosh.

48:22.763 --> 48:23.615
- Good afternoon,

48:23.615 --> 48:26.135
if you are just tuning in,
this is a national alert.

48:26.135 --> 48:27.316
Reports of people dropping dead

48:27.316 --> 48:28.815
are coming from everywhere.

48:28.815 --> 48:30.252
Government officials claim it could be

48:30.252 --> 48:32.724
related to Dr. Fantom's disease.

48:32.724 --> 48:35.204
The first notable outbreak
was six years ago.

48:35.204 --> 48:37.083
If so, it seems to be spreading again

48:37.083 --> 48:38.682
at an alarming rate.

48:38.682 --> 48:41.822
The president has not
yet made a statement.

48:56.858 --> 48:58.228
- Hello.

48:58.228 --> 49:00.071
I keep hearing gun shots,

49:00.071 --> 49:01.169
and I wanted to make sure that

49:01.169 --> 49:02.999
everything's okay over here.

49:02.999 --> 49:04.249
Where's Jayden?

49:05.813 --> 49:06.924
- Amy!

49:06.924 --> 49:07.784
How are you?

49:07.784 --> 49:09.410
It's so nice to see you.

49:09.410 --> 49:10.834
- I'm fine.

49:10.834 --> 49:14.314
How come my neighbor
has kids shooting guns?

49:14.314 --> 49:15.264
What is going on?

49:15.264 --> 49:17.165
- Yeah, I've been meaning
to call you, see...

49:17.165 --> 49:18.325
They're foreign exchange students,

49:18.325 --> 49:20.805
and I'm helping out with the community.

49:20.805 --> 49:21.805
- Oh, I see.

49:22.805 --> 49:25.205
- Yeah, so, they're staying
with me this semester.

49:25.205 --> 49:27.914
I have teachers coming to
the house to tutor them.

49:27.914 --> 49:29.984
- Well, very nice to meet you both.

49:29.984 --> 49:30.817
- Yes, I'm Trevor.

49:30.817 --> 49:32.612
- They don't speak English.

49:32.612 --> 49:34.172
- Oh, where are they from?

49:34.172 --> 49:35.634
- They're from Uganda.

49:35.634 --> 49:36.565
- Oh my.

49:36.565 --> 49:37.504
- Yeah.

49:37.504 --> 49:39.554
- Are you sure it's okay to have them

49:39.554 --> 49:41.804
out like this unsupervised?

49:43.205 --> 49:44.794
- Of course.

49:44.794 --> 49:46.064
Every single kid in Uganda

49:46.064 --> 49:49.144
learns how guns work at a very early age.

49:49.144 --> 49:50.525
It's part of their culture.

49:50.525 --> 49:53.024
- I didn't know that.

49:53.024 --> 49:56.114
- Well, they are from Uganda, so...

49:56.114 --> 49:57.285
They know best.

49:57.285 --> 50:01.704
Plus, it's a fun activity
and it keeps them busy.

50:01.704 --> 50:03.224
- Good for you, Jayden.

50:03.224 --> 50:04.512
I'm very proud of you.

50:04.512 --> 50:06.354
- Thank you, thank you so much.

50:06.354 --> 50:07.187
Shall we?

50:11.914 --> 50:12.747
- Uganda?

50:12.747 --> 50:13.664
Why does he even think of that?

50:13.664 --> 50:15.005
- Where'd he get that one from?

50:15.005 --> 50:16.205
I can't believe she fell for that.

50:22.367 --> 50:23.566
- Sorry about that.

50:23.566 --> 50:24.775
My neighbors don't exactly know what it is

50:24.775 --> 50:27.219
that I do for obvious reasons.

50:27.219 --> 50:29.830
So, Lindsey, do you have
any questions for me?

50:29.830 --> 50:31.648
- Um, I don't think so.

50:31.648 --> 50:33.938
I really like this program you've created.

50:33.938 --> 50:35.259
When can I start?

50:35.259 --> 50:36.959
- Um, later this afternoon I'll have you

50:36.959 --> 50:38.166
link up with the boys.

50:38.166 --> 50:39.822
But first, I have a few documents

50:39.822 --> 50:40.655
for you to sign.

50:40.655 --> 50:42.000
- Great, I'm excited.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.710
Thank goodness my mom
recommended me for it.

50:44.710 --> 50:45.574
- Your mom?

50:45.574 --> 50:46.907
- Mhm.

50:47.774 --> 50:50.147
- I almost forgot Natalie was an agent.

50:50.147 --> 50:51.705
- I think she has a little
thing for you, Jayden.

50:51.705 --> 50:53.328
She said you two go way back.

50:53.328 --> 50:54.661
- Is that right?

50:58.185 --> 50:59.018
- Awkward.

51:10.656 --> 51:11.542
- Who is she?

51:11.542 --> 51:12.392
- I don't know.

51:12.392 --> 51:13.331
She's kinda cute.

51:13.331 --> 51:14.571
- Kinda cute?

51:14.571 --> 51:16.568
She's beautiful.

51:16.568 --> 51:18.651
- Oh, you're right.

51:18.651 --> 51:20.656
- Dude, should we go over there?

51:20.656 --> 51:21.752
What do you think they're talking about?

51:21.752 --> 51:22.585
- No.

51:22.585 --> 51:24.712
Dude, I want to play some
PS4 before math class.

51:24.712 --> 51:26.110
- No, no, no, hold on, hold on.

51:26.110 --> 51:27.742
- But Overwatch is calling me.

51:27.742 --> 51:28.769
- Ugh.

51:28.769 --> 51:29.862
Okay, come on.

51:29.862 --> 51:30.840
We'll go around to the back.

51:30.840 --> 51:31.673
- Okay.

51:33.259 --> 51:36.392
- Let's break up into groups.

51:36.392 --> 51:37.225
- Into groups?

51:37.225 --> 51:38.410
There's only two of us.

51:38.410 --> 51:40.192
- Then find a partner.

51:40.192 --> 51:42.692
Let me know when you're ready.

51:44.638 --> 51:45.471
- Jesus.

51:47.387 --> 51:48.260
- Sorry I'm late.

51:48.260 --> 51:50.247
- Oh, that's quite alright Ms. Lindsey.

51:50.247 --> 51:51.548
I heard you'd be joining us today.

51:51.548 --> 51:53.215
Please, have a seat.

51:57.767 --> 51:59.855
- Sup, I'm Pocketman.

51:59.855 --> 52:01.272
This is Cargoboy.

52:02.287 --> 52:03.355
- Pocketman?

52:04.786 --> 52:05.654
- I'm Lindsey.

52:05.654 --> 52:07.527
- We were just about to split into groups

52:07.527 --> 52:09.287
for Mr. Barf's math class.

52:09.287 --> 52:11.157
Would you like to be my partner?

52:11.157 --> 52:12.527
- Hey!

52:12.527 --> 52:13.738
- Um, sure.

52:13.738 --> 52:16.538
- Also, all agents, students,

52:16.538 --> 52:19.069
are required to have a nickname.

52:19.069 --> 52:20.487
- Codename.

52:20.487 --> 52:21.639
- Sorry.

52:21.639 --> 52:23.615
And it must relate to pants.

52:23.615 --> 52:25.452
But since you're not wearing any,

52:25.452 --> 52:27.810
I guess we'll call you Miniskirt.

52:28.846 --> 52:32.734
- Well, Jayden told me
to dress professionally.

52:32.734 --> 52:34.152
- I didn't get that memo.

52:34.152 --> 52:36.917
Actually, I've never received a memo.

52:36.917 --> 52:39.872
- And I didn't know a skirt
was something to laugh at.

52:39.872 --> 52:42.613
- Okay, may I continue?

52:42.613 --> 52:43.561
Thanks.

52:43.561 --> 52:47.813
Alright, now, suppose a
student has 80 nickels.

52:47.813 --> 52:48.646
Right?

52:48.646 --> 52:51.003
Now they use some of the
nickels to buy a cookie.

52:51.003 --> 52:54.152
Later on, get this, they
find 12 more nickels

52:54.152 --> 52:55.792
mysteriously in their backpack,

52:55.792 --> 53:00.040
thus bringing the total to
75 nickels they now have.

53:00.040 --> 53:00.961
How many nickels did they use

53:00.961 --> 53:02.573
to buy the cookie?

53:02.573 --> 53:04.333
- Look, do we have to do this?

53:04.333 --> 53:06.683
- Yeah, you have to do this.

53:06.683 --> 53:08.172
- 17 nickels.

53:08.172 --> 53:09.043
- Excellent.

53:09.043 --> 53:10.072
Please explain.

53:10.072 --> 53:11.550
- He took the ending number 75

53:11.550 --> 53:13.840
and subtracted the number of
nickels the student found.

53:13.840 --> 53:15.443
That left him with 63,

53:15.443 --> 53:16.991
then he took how many nickels the student

53:16.991 --> 53:19.391
started with and subtracted 63.

53:19.391 --> 53:23.141
Which gives him 17
nickels, and me one skirt.

53:29.280 --> 53:30.591
- Wow.

53:30.591 --> 53:31.424
Wow, wow.

53:33.700 --> 53:36.283
I'll take this, I'll take this.

53:43.574 --> 53:44.824
Let's go buddy.

53:53.347 --> 53:54.658
- Where did Mr. Barf go?

53:54.658 --> 53:56.325
- He was just there.

53:58.775 --> 54:00.694
- What did you do?

54:36.064 --> 54:37.919
- Before class ends, I
want to quickly go over

54:37.919 --> 54:40.760
the most wanted criminals.

54:40.760 --> 54:43.472
In Section 62, we do list the criminals

54:43.472 --> 54:44.971
in order of danger,

54:44.971 --> 54:46.491
so that our agents know and understand

54:46.491 --> 54:48.051
what they're up against.

54:48.051 --> 54:51.752
Pocketman, could you
start with three please?

54:51.752 --> 54:53.878
- Um, number three.

54:53.878 --> 54:55.531
Sir Longbottom.

54:56.832 --> 54:58.072
Should I keep going?

54:58.072 --> 55:02.155
- Well, does anyone know
anything about this man?

55:03.352 --> 55:04.891
- I now know that one of the most

55:04.891 --> 55:06.180
dangerous criminals in the world

55:06.180 --> 55:07.992
has one of the most ridiculous names

55:07.992 --> 55:09.140
I have ever heard.

55:09.973 --> 55:11.390
- That may be so!

55:15.901 --> 55:18.392
But he's extremely dangerous.

55:18.392 --> 55:19.822
It's been over 30 years since an agent

55:19.822 --> 55:22.739
has reported seeing Sir Longbottom.

55:23.712 --> 55:26.281
Lindsey, can you continue?

55:26.281 --> 55:27.658
- Number two.

55:27.658 --> 55:29.818
Dr. Collin Fantom.

55:29.818 --> 55:32.547
- Dr. Collin Fantom is an ex-agent.

55:32.547 --> 55:33.878
He was credited with the creation

55:33.878 --> 55:37.867
of a deadly disease that he
calls the Fantom Disease.

55:37.867 --> 55:39.328
The disease spreads on contact,

55:39.328 --> 55:42.398
and it kills almost immediately.

55:42.398 --> 55:43.408
No one has been known to last

55:43.408 --> 55:44.808
more than a few hours once the disease

55:44.808 --> 55:46.918
has entered their body.

55:46.918 --> 55:50.059
That's why he's so high up on the list.

55:50.059 --> 55:52.747
- That's the guy we
heard about on the radio.

55:52.747 --> 55:55.718
- So, he's still a major threat now then?

55:55.718 --> 55:57.787
- That's correct.

55:57.787 --> 55:59.347
- Then who's number one?

55:59.347 --> 56:00.507
It doesn't say.
- It's not in here.

56:00.507 --> 56:02.547
- We're not going into that today.

56:02.547 --> 56:03.714
Class is over.

56:04.899 --> 56:06.448
- Hey, why don't we hang out more?

56:06.448 --> 56:07.718
- Because.

56:07.718 --> 56:08.945
- Oh, come on.

56:08.945 --> 56:10.118
I like to know everyone I work with,

56:10.118 --> 56:13.678
and I don't know anything about you.

56:13.678 --> 56:15.219
Do you like the kids?

56:15.219 --> 56:16.648
- No.

56:16.648 --> 56:17.756
- I do.

56:17.756 --> 56:20.419
I think Lindsey's very sweet.

56:20.419 --> 56:22.778
I think what Jayden's
doing here is really good.

56:22.778 --> 56:24.838
- Look, you have Jayden, I have coffee.

56:24.838 --> 56:27.518
Why don't you tell him
about these amazing things?

56:27.518 --> 56:28.518
- Okay then.

56:29.556 --> 56:30.728
Wait a minute, you're married.

56:30.728 --> 56:32.779
You have more than just coffee.

56:32.779 --> 56:35.946
- Who do you think buys me the coffee?

56:39.328 --> 56:42.379
- Alright, you're gonna
slowly punch towards my chest,

56:42.379 --> 56:45.918
wrap it around, thumb on
top, and then twist it.

56:45.918 --> 56:46.751
Alright?

56:46.751 --> 56:47.819
- Okay.

56:47.819 --> 56:48.652
- Okay.

56:50.187 --> 56:51.604
- Okay.

56:52.608 --> 56:53.441
Okay.

56:53.441 --> 56:54.274
- You try.

56:56.387 --> 56:57.220
- Hi.

56:57.220 --> 56:58.056
- Alright, let's go.

56:58.056 --> 56:58.889
- Ready?

56:58.889 --> 56:59.722
- Yeah.

57:00.936 --> 57:02.487
Ow.

57:02.487 --> 57:03.320
- Really?

57:03.320 --> 57:04.656
That's all you can do?

57:04.656 --> 57:07.248
Whoa, hey now, let's not do that.

57:07.248 --> 57:10.038
That was the weakest thing I've ever done.

57:37.949 --> 57:40.778
- You know there's class tonight, right?

57:40.778 --> 57:42.549
What are you doing here?

57:42.549 --> 57:43.799
- I was hungry.

57:44.639 --> 57:46.098
- Yeah.

57:46.098 --> 57:46.931
Me too.

57:48.449 --> 57:50.258
So what do you think about Lindsey?

57:50.258 --> 57:51.341
- I like her.

57:52.339 --> 57:54.256
I mean, agent to agent.

57:56.067 --> 57:58.435
- Yeah, her mom's an
agent like Cargoboy's dad.

57:58.435 --> 57:59.915
She was one of the first
applicants I received

57:59.915 --> 58:02.664
when we started the program.

58:02.664 --> 58:04.504
I'm just happy that
word's traveling around

58:04.504 --> 58:05.805
and all the agents
think this whole thing's

58:05.805 --> 58:07.634
a good idea.

58:07.634 --> 58:09.301
- It is a good idea.

58:13.794 --> 58:15.975
What, what's happening?

58:15.975 --> 58:17.225
- Run, run now!

58:21.710 --> 58:22.720
- What is that?

58:22.720 --> 58:23.586
It's loud.

58:23.586 --> 58:25.602
Boss? Trevor?

58:25.602 --> 58:26.435
- Boss!

58:26.435 --> 58:28.379
- What is going on?

58:28.379 --> 58:29.212
- Move!

58:29.212 --> 58:30.045
Go, go!

58:31.418 --> 58:32.585
- Oh, go!

58:35.029 --> 58:36.273
- Take the kids to the safe room.

58:36.273 --> 58:37.474
Hurry, go, go!

58:45.040 --> 58:46.222
- Mark this is a wall?

58:46.222 --> 58:47.305
- Go, get in.

58:48.160 --> 58:49.131
Guys, get in there.

58:49.131 --> 58:50.542
Do not open this door

58:50.542 --> 58:51.870
unless Jay gives you permission.

58:51.870 --> 58:53.100
Do you understand?

59:15.804 --> 59:16.782
Shit.

59:53.523 --> 59:54.940
- Oh no.

59:56.073 --> 59:57.478
- This is terrible.

59:57.478 --> 59:58.645
- Hackawackie?

01:00:01.269 --> 01:00:02.190
- He's dead.

01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:04.819
Sunshine and Pain Killer are dead too.

01:00:04.819 --> 01:00:07.127
- But what about...

01:00:07.127 --> 01:00:08.558
- Boss.

01:00:08.558 --> 01:00:09.391
Boss.

01:00:10.729 --> 01:00:11.562
Boss.

01:00:12.718 --> 01:00:14.110
Come on, let's get you up.

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:14.943
- No.

01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:17.859
I'm fine, Pocketman.

01:00:17.859 --> 01:00:18.889
- Sir.

01:00:18.889 --> 01:00:20.169
You are bleeding.

01:00:20.169 --> 01:00:22.038
The other teachers are dead.

01:00:22.038 --> 01:00:25.459
We need to get you some help, let me help.

01:00:25.459 --> 01:00:26.838
- Nothing can help.

01:00:26.838 --> 01:00:27.671
- Boss...

01:00:28.668 --> 01:00:29.711
- What do we do?

01:00:29.711 --> 01:00:31.380
- You guys have a job to do now.

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.911
- Forget the program.

01:00:32.911 --> 01:00:34.328
- Don't say that.

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:36.481
Remember the other day in class

01:00:36.481 --> 01:00:38.540
we spoke about the Fantom Disease?

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:41.408
- You're telling me a disease caused this?

01:00:41.408 --> 01:00:44.075
- It kills on contact, remember?

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:48.921
The disease has a very
interesting chemical design.

01:00:48.921 --> 01:00:52.761
Once it sucks all the life
from the victim's body,

01:00:52.761 --> 01:00:54.669
it leaves the victim and can detect

01:00:54.669 --> 01:00:57.281
the nearest living organism.

01:00:57.281 --> 01:00:59.788
It feeds like a vampire.

01:00:59.788 --> 01:01:01.492
- Well, if it's still spreading,

01:01:01.492 --> 01:01:03.591
then how do we stop it?

01:01:03.591 --> 01:01:04.424
- You can't.

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:06.681
- Well that's just great.

01:01:06.681 --> 01:01:09.281
- You can't stop the disease,

01:01:09.281 --> 01:01:12.081
but you could stop the
creator of the disease.

01:01:12.081 --> 01:01:13.412
- Time travel.

01:01:13.412 --> 01:01:15.111
- Yes.

01:01:15.111 --> 01:01:16.340
You have to hurry before it loops

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.800
back around and catches you.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.732
- What about you?

01:01:20.732 --> 01:01:23.191
- I'll be fine here.

01:01:23.191 --> 01:01:25.412
- Look, we can't do this without you.

01:01:25.412 --> 01:01:26.732
I don't even know where to find him,

01:01:26.732 --> 01:01:28.110
or how far back to travel.

01:01:29.652 --> 01:01:30.485
- I do.

01:01:32.311 --> 01:01:34.911
I can tell you that much,

01:01:34.911 --> 01:01:36.441
and then you're on your own.

01:01:36.441 --> 01:01:38.111
- Are you sure this is a good idea?

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:39.732
We're still just kids.

01:01:39.732 --> 01:01:42.100
- Look at it this way.

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:45.767
If you weren't here,
who else could go back?

01:01:47.292 --> 01:01:49.711
He'll never see you coming.

01:01:49.711 --> 01:01:52.429
Use that to your advantage.

01:01:52.429 --> 01:01:54.609
There's nothing here for you now.

01:01:54.609 --> 01:01:58.442
Don't be part of the
problem, be the solution.

01:01:59.332 --> 01:02:00.165
Trust me.

01:02:01.241 --> 01:02:03.408
Trust me and your friends.

01:02:05.478 --> 01:02:07.728
- I do trust you, and them.

01:02:09.543 --> 01:02:13.665
- If you only learn one
thing from me, learn this...

01:02:15.623 --> 01:02:18.523
Some people will always doubt you,

01:02:18.523 --> 01:02:23.280
but that doesn't matter,
unless you doubt yourself.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.113
So don't.

01:02:26.013 --> 01:02:27.346
- Okay.

01:02:28.381 --> 01:02:29.282
We'll do it.

01:02:29.282 --> 01:02:30.871
- We will?

01:02:30.871 --> 01:02:33.080
- I'll grab the Shatter Stick.

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:36.880
- Pocketman, wait.

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:39.238
One more thing.

01:02:40.163 --> 01:02:43.483
Don't forget shades of gray.

01:02:43.483 --> 01:02:45.903
You may have to kill to stop him.

01:02:45.903 --> 01:02:48.770
But that doesn't make you a bad person.

01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:51.939
He's already taken the life of millions.

01:02:51.939 --> 01:02:55.606
You just have to take
one to save millions.

01:02:57.014 --> 01:02:59.056
- Here, think of this as our final exam.

01:02:59.056 --> 01:03:00.344
Save the world and get an A,

01:03:00.344 --> 01:03:01.646
get killed and mess up horribly

01:03:01.646 --> 01:03:03.151
because we hadn't had enough training

01:03:03.151 --> 01:03:05.273
to do something like this, and we fail.

01:03:05.273 --> 01:03:06.481
- That's the spirit.

01:03:06.481 --> 01:03:07.314
- Yeah.

01:03:08.753 --> 01:03:09.586
Ready?

01:03:11.182 --> 01:03:12.151
- Ready.

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.428
Where are we?

01:03:23.428 --> 01:03:25.174
This doesn't look familiar at all.

01:03:25.174 --> 01:03:26.894
- The Shatter Stick moves
you through time and space,

01:03:26.894 --> 01:03:28.254
which means since the Earth is--

01:03:28.254 --> 01:03:29.442
- I'm gonna stop you there.

01:03:29.442 --> 01:03:31.185
- Is that...

01:03:32.144 --> 01:03:33.595
Is that Mr. Barf?

01:03:33.595 --> 01:03:35.095
- No, it can't be.

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:37.453
- Where did you--

01:03:37.453 --> 01:03:38.433
- Look at his tie.

01:03:38.433 --> 01:03:39.273
- What did you do?

01:03:39.273 --> 01:03:42.123
- Okay, um, what did you do?

01:03:42.123 --> 01:03:44.491
And you can't tell me you
didn't do anything because--

01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:46.443
- Look, he was getting on my nerves,

01:03:46.443 --> 01:03:48.302
so I used the Shatter Stick

01:03:48.302 --> 01:03:50.469
and sent him back in time.

01:03:51.453 --> 01:03:53.501
- To this exact day?

01:03:53.501 --> 01:03:55.310
- Not exactly.

01:03:55.310 --> 01:03:56.841
He's been wandering
around in this time period

01:03:56.841 --> 01:03:57.931
for about a month.

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:02.422
- Trevor, you are so stupid.

01:04:02.422 --> 01:04:04.531
- Because math, dude.

01:04:04.531 --> 01:04:05.961
- Hey.

01:04:05.961 --> 01:04:07.982
Are you alright?

01:04:07.982 --> 01:04:10.748
- Kyle, Lindsey, I'm so happy to see you!

01:04:10.748 --> 01:04:12.761
- Uh, I'm here too.

01:04:12.761 --> 01:04:13.594
- Oh.

01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:16.317
- You alright?

01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:18.942
- No.

01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:21.610
I seem to be terribly confused.

01:04:21.610 --> 01:04:22.870
- It's okay.

01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:24.387
- Guys, we have to tell him--

01:04:24.387 --> 01:04:26.180
- I really don't think that's--

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:28.961
- Mr. Barve, you work for Section 62

01:04:28.961 --> 01:04:31.977
of the CIA, the three of
us are agents in training,

01:04:31.977 --> 01:04:33.921
and the other teachers
are some of the finest

01:04:33.921 --> 01:04:35.910
agents in the country.

01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:36.885
Jay didn't want you to find out.

01:04:36.885 --> 01:04:37.991
- Might as well
tell him your part too.

01:04:37.991 --> 01:04:39.645
- No, don't do that.

01:04:39.645 --> 01:04:40.478
No, don't--

01:04:40.478 --> 01:04:42.441
- And I used the Shatter Stick

01:04:42.441 --> 01:04:44.148
and sent you six years into the past,

01:04:44.148 --> 01:04:45.771
and I am so sorry.

01:04:45.771 --> 01:04:47.091
- Oh.

01:04:47.091 --> 01:04:48.073
- Oh, okay, ow, ew.

01:04:48.073 --> 01:04:50.273
- Yeah, that's leaving a mark, okay.

01:04:50.273 --> 01:04:51.873
Great plan, Cargoboy.

01:04:51.873 --> 01:04:52.706
- You know what?

01:04:52.706 --> 01:04:55.942
I wasn't gonna mention the
whole time travel part.

01:04:55.942 --> 01:04:56.775
You know what?

01:04:56.775 --> 01:04:57.608
At least he's out of the way.

01:04:57.608 --> 01:05:00.275
We need to find a car, and fast.

01:05:01.401 --> 01:05:02.234
What?

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:05.913
- Did Boss give you directions?

01:05:05.913 --> 01:05:07.561
- Yes, we're close.

01:05:07.561 --> 01:05:09.209
I grew up around this area.

01:05:09.209 --> 01:05:10.193
I can picture the warehouse

01:05:10.193 --> 01:05:11.601
Boss was talking about.

01:05:11.601 --> 01:05:13.689
- Um, Pocketman, quick question.

01:05:13.689 --> 01:05:14.902
Can you hotwire a car?

01:05:14.902 --> 01:05:19.152
- Can I hotwire a car?

01:05:23.561 --> 01:05:24.531
Moron.

01:05:24.531 --> 01:05:25.411
Everyone knows you lock your doors.

01:05:25.411 --> 01:05:26.244
- Okay, pushing him in.

01:05:26.244 --> 01:05:27.077
- Head first.

01:05:27.077 --> 01:05:27.910
- Okay.

01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:28.743
Alright.

01:05:28.743 --> 01:05:29.660
- Oh, careful with his arms.

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:30.499
Yep, alright.

01:05:30.499 --> 01:05:31.353
- Alright, get in.

01:05:31.353 --> 01:05:32.310
- Just let it, okay.

01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:33.143
- You got him?

01:05:33.143 --> 01:05:33.976
- And then I push his legs in.

01:05:33.976 --> 01:05:34.809
- Okay.

01:05:34.809 --> 01:05:35.642
- There we go.

01:05:35.642 --> 01:05:36.614
That's good.

01:05:36.614 --> 01:05:37.447
Perfect.

01:05:40.042 --> 01:05:41.233
Okay.

01:05:41.233 --> 01:05:42.641
- You actually got him back there.

01:05:42.641 --> 01:05:43.474
- Yeah.

01:05:43.474 --> 01:05:44.326
- Nicely done.

01:05:44.326 --> 01:05:45.545
- Trev, how you doing?

01:05:45.545 --> 01:05:46.378
- Uh...

01:05:46.378 --> 01:05:50.715
- You don't know
what you're doing, do you?

01:05:50.715 --> 01:05:52.132
- I have no idea.

01:05:53.426 --> 01:05:54.259
- Alright.

01:05:54.259 --> 01:05:55.804
Step back and let the master work.

01:05:55.804 --> 01:05:56.974
- It's all yours.

01:05:56.974 --> 01:05:58.065
- Open it and get in?

01:05:58.065 --> 01:05:59.701
- Yes.

01:05:59.701 --> 01:06:00.534
Okay.

01:06:01.394 --> 01:06:04.114
So, disconnect this one,

01:06:04.114 --> 01:06:05.994
and then take the red.

01:06:18.854 --> 01:06:20.516
- We almost died.

01:06:20.516 --> 01:06:22.334
- But did you die?

01:06:22.334 --> 01:06:23.505
- And I thought Cruella de Vil

01:06:23.505 --> 01:06:25.588
was a crazy woman driver.

01:06:28.031 --> 01:06:30.996
- You know what, you guys
go on, I'll watch him.

01:06:30.996 --> 01:06:32.171
- You sure?

01:06:32.171 --> 01:06:33.004
- Yeah.

01:06:33.004 --> 01:06:33.949
Just shout if you need me.

01:06:33.949 --> 01:06:35.239
You're the best fighter anyways,

01:06:35.239 --> 01:06:37.501
and if he's as dangerous
as Boss says he is,

01:06:37.501 --> 01:06:40.280
then you need to be the
one to confront him.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.371
- Alright.

01:06:41.371 --> 01:06:42.788
Be safe out here.

01:07:19.828 --> 01:07:21.411
- Well, well, well.

01:07:22.748 --> 01:07:25.288
To what do I owe this little visit?

01:07:25.288 --> 01:07:26.288
- Are you...

01:07:27.238 --> 01:07:28.155
Dr. Fantom?

01:07:29.058 --> 01:07:30.597
- Please.

01:07:30.597 --> 01:07:32.462
Call me Collin.

01:07:32.462 --> 01:07:36.119
To answer your very
demanding question, yes.

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:37.952
What can I do for you?

01:07:38.978 --> 01:07:42.359
- What do you know about
the Fantom Disease?

01:07:42.359 --> 01:07:44.026
- Never heard of it.

01:07:45.119 --> 01:07:47.258
Is that a gun that I see?

01:07:47.258 --> 01:07:48.899
Are you going to shoot me, young man?

01:07:48.899 --> 01:07:50.929
Have I done something wrong?

01:07:50.929 --> 01:07:53.639
- In the future, you release a disease

01:07:53.639 --> 01:07:55.868
that nearly kills everyone on the planet.

01:07:55.868 --> 01:07:57.177
- I see.

01:07:57.177 --> 01:07:59.510
And you are here to stop me?

01:08:01.313 --> 01:08:03.465
- You kids don't belong here.

01:08:03.465 --> 01:08:04.625
- Don't listen to him.

01:08:04.625 --> 01:08:06.375
- Oh no, little girl.

01:08:08.161 --> 01:08:10.202
You should listen to me.

01:08:10.202 --> 01:08:11.502
It's inappropriate for you to come here

01:08:11.502 --> 01:08:13.419
and hurl these threats.

01:08:14.293 --> 01:08:16.069
I have enough enemies already.

01:08:16.069 --> 01:08:17.242
- Why?

01:08:17.242 --> 01:08:18.392
- Why?

01:08:18.392 --> 01:08:21.767
Because I was lied to, that's why.

01:08:21.767 --> 01:08:24.555
I was used as a pawn of this government

01:08:24.555 --> 01:08:27.064
to give them what they wanted.

01:08:27.064 --> 01:08:28.776
- Who lied to you?

01:08:28.776 --> 01:08:31.366
- Do you know who I am?

01:08:31.366 --> 01:08:32.198
Truly?

01:08:35.397 --> 01:08:37.586
I was hired by the agency to create

01:08:37.586 --> 01:08:40.002
a new serum for the military.

01:08:41.424 --> 01:08:43.892
I called it Spectrum.

01:08:43.892 --> 01:08:46.270
It was supposed to increase adrenaline

01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:47.853
and improve memory.

01:08:49.683 --> 01:08:53.522
Essentially, the strong got stronger,

01:08:53.522 --> 01:08:55.801
and the smart got smarter.

01:08:55.801 --> 01:08:57.140
- Like Captain America.

01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:58.712
- Not now.

01:08:58.712 --> 01:09:00.679
What happened?

01:09:00.679 --> 01:09:03.801
- They wanted faster progress.

01:09:03.801 --> 01:09:08.029
So my funding was pulled,
my laboratory, shut down.

01:09:08.029 --> 01:09:10.761
I was left with nothing but my work.

01:09:10.761 --> 01:09:11.911
And the one who made the call

01:09:11.911 --> 01:09:13.068
to pull my funding?

01:09:13.068 --> 01:09:14.818
To close down my lab?

01:09:16.410 --> 01:09:19.465
Was one of the agency's finest.

01:09:19.465 --> 01:09:21.381
My best friend, Jayden.

01:09:24.296 --> 01:09:25.435
- You know Jay?

01:09:25.435 --> 01:09:27.269
- Everybody knows Jay.

01:09:28.764 --> 01:09:31.587
But only I know him for what he truly is.

01:09:31.587 --> 01:09:32.837
A twisted soul.

01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:38.157
He may seem like a good man,

01:09:38.157 --> 01:09:39.586
but I will never forget the way

01:09:39.586 --> 01:09:42.170
he turned his back on me.

01:09:42.170 --> 01:09:43.649
- People change.

01:09:43.649 --> 01:09:45.388
Jay isn't like that.

01:09:45.388 --> 01:09:47.890
- People change but,
you're here to kill me

01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:50.707
for something I haven't even done yet.

01:09:50.707 --> 01:09:52.957
But people change, right?

01:09:52.957 --> 01:09:54.957
- He's messing with you.

01:09:55.904 --> 01:09:57.580
- Jayden was doing what
he believed was right.

01:09:59.512 --> 01:10:00.345
- Perhaps.

01:10:01.226 --> 01:10:03.623
But I've already lost my
life once at his hands,

01:10:03.623 --> 01:10:04.853
and I will not simply allow you

01:10:04.853 --> 01:10:06.936
to come here and kill me!

01:10:07.841 --> 01:10:11.758
When I am on the verge
of doing something great.

01:10:13.474 --> 01:10:14.823
- Look.

01:10:14.823 --> 01:10:17.093
I can't leave this
timeline unless I'm certain

01:10:17.093 --> 01:10:19.493
the disease won't ever be released.

01:10:19.493 --> 01:10:21.725
- Don't get in my way, boy.

01:10:21.725 --> 01:10:24.372
- I'll do what I have to.

01:10:24.372 --> 01:10:25.205
- Brave.

01:10:31.997 --> 01:10:35.997
You've been well trained
for such a young agent.

01:10:44.419 --> 01:10:46.419
I'm going to enjoy this.

01:11:00.085 --> 01:11:00.918
- Come on.

01:11:00.918 --> 01:11:02.585
- Come on.

01:11:20.858 --> 01:11:21.864
Trevor!

01:11:21.864 --> 01:11:23.447
- Hang on.

01:12:37.225 --> 01:12:39.642
- Come to me, child.

01:12:42.418 --> 01:12:44.029
Drop it.

01:12:44.029 --> 01:12:45.237
- Let him go.

01:12:45.237 --> 01:12:47.973
- I will crush his throat.

01:12:47.973 --> 01:12:49.274
- Shoot him, Lindsey.

01:12:49.274 --> 01:12:50.434
I trust you.

01:12:50.434 --> 01:12:52.872
- Listen, young lady.

01:12:52.872 --> 01:12:54.666
Drop the gun.

01:12:54.666 --> 01:12:56.586
Did you really think that the two of you

01:12:56.586 --> 01:12:57.753
could stop me?

01:12:58.705 --> 01:12:59.594
- Shoot him!

01:12:59.594 --> 01:13:02.845
- I am going to create
something beautiful.

01:13:10.856 --> 01:13:13.606
- You think you got him?

01:13:16.677 --> 01:13:18.732
- What have you done?

01:13:18.732 --> 01:13:21.661
- You didn't give us a choice.

01:13:21.661 --> 01:13:22.828
- I'm not bad.

01:13:25.296 --> 01:13:26.879
I just wanted to...

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.680
I want people to know...

01:13:33.062 --> 01:13:34.645
- People will know.

01:13:36.733 --> 01:13:39.400
- I didn't want to hurt anybody.

01:13:41.368 --> 01:13:42.737
- It's okay.

01:13:42.737 --> 01:13:43.799
People often regret the things

01:13:43.799 --> 01:13:46.067
they didn't stand up for.

01:13:46.067 --> 01:13:50.028
If you believe in something, then show it.

01:13:53.003 --> 01:13:54.920
- I wanted to change...

01:14:12.294 --> 01:14:13.127
- Where are they?

01:14:13.127 --> 01:14:14.014
- I don't know!
- This is ridiculous.

01:14:14.014 --> 01:14:15.544
- Jay sent us to get
milk and eggs, that's it.

01:14:15.544 --> 01:14:16.774
- Oh, from the farm where it came from?

01:14:16.774 --> 01:14:17.607
- No, from the grocery store

01:14:17.607 --> 01:14:18.638
like everyone else does.

01:14:18.638 --> 01:14:19.471
- Look, they're limping.

01:14:19.471 --> 01:14:21.964
- I don't know, maybe
they rolled their ankle.

01:14:21.964 --> 01:14:22.797
Oh my God.

01:14:24.071 --> 01:14:24.904
Success?

01:14:26.374 --> 01:14:27.207
- Success.

01:14:28.462 --> 01:14:29.494
- We should probably get going.

01:14:29.494 --> 01:14:30.564
He woke up a few minutes ago,

01:14:30.564 --> 01:14:32.924
and I tried telling him that Jay sent us

01:14:32.924 --> 01:14:34.182
to get milk and eggs.

01:14:34.182 --> 01:14:36.245
He didn't really buy it.

01:14:36.245 --> 01:14:39.345
- That's what
you came up with for a lie?

01:14:39.345 --> 01:14:41.105
We don't have licenses.

01:14:41.105 --> 01:14:43.225
- I knew it, you little liars.

01:14:43.225 --> 01:14:44.904
Children, what is going on?

01:14:44.904 --> 01:14:46.454
Why are you bleeding?

01:14:46.454 --> 01:14:48.033
Is that a gun?

01:14:48.033 --> 01:14:49.502
- Can we go now?

01:14:49.502 --> 01:14:50.764
- Yes, I want to go.

01:14:50.764 --> 01:14:51.625
You're so annoying.

01:14:51.625 --> 01:14:52.745
- I don't get paid
enough to deal with you.

01:14:52.745 --> 01:14:54.374
- I don't care.

01:14:59.501 --> 01:15:01.019
- There we go!

01:15:01.019 --> 01:15:03.274
- Wasn't that bad, right?

01:15:03.274 --> 01:15:04.885
- What?

01:15:04.885 --> 01:15:06.052
- You're fine.

01:15:07.621 --> 01:15:08.903
- What are you four doing?

01:15:08.903 --> 01:15:09.834
- Oh my God.

01:15:09.834 --> 01:15:11.173
These students of yours have completely--

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:12.131
- Studying.

01:15:12.131 --> 01:15:15.653
Mr. Barve was just helping
us with some questions

01:15:15.653 --> 01:15:18.045
we had on the homework.

01:15:18.045 --> 01:15:19.764
- Okay then.

01:15:19.764 --> 01:15:20.632
Don't be late for class,

01:15:20.632 --> 01:15:21.893
I have a lot to cover today.

01:15:21.893 --> 01:15:22.726
- Okay, got it.

01:15:22.726 --> 01:15:23.559
- Oh yeah, almost forgot.

01:15:23.559 --> 01:15:25.499
Cargoboy, are you still able to DJ

01:15:25.499 --> 01:15:26.848
for the wedding this weekend?

01:15:26.848 --> 01:15:27.957
- Uh.
- What?

01:15:27.957 --> 01:15:29.506
For what?
- Yeah.

01:15:29.506 --> 01:15:30.339
What, again?

01:15:30.339 --> 01:15:31.172
For what?

01:15:31.172 --> 01:15:32.005
Whose wedding?

01:15:32.005 --> 01:15:33.687
- Mine and Diane's.

01:15:33.687 --> 01:15:34.567
- Oh.

01:15:34.567 --> 01:15:36.385
Yeah.

01:15:36.385 --> 01:15:39.247
Just got caught up with the homework.

01:15:39.247 --> 01:15:40.266
- Great.

01:15:40.266 --> 01:15:41.099
Thanks.

01:15:41.099 --> 01:15:42.146
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:15:42.146 --> 01:15:43.516
None of this strikes you as odd?

01:15:43.516 --> 01:15:45.023
You're not gonna question any of this?

01:15:45.023 --> 01:15:46.636
- Mr. Barve.

01:15:46.636 --> 01:15:48.647
Clean yourself up already.

01:15:48.647 --> 01:15:49.637
- Let me just fix your tie.

01:15:49.637 --> 01:15:50.594
- I miss my calculator.

01:15:50.594 --> 01:15:51.527
- You're fine, no it's...

01:15:51.527 --> 01:15:52.360
Okay.

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.560
Whoa, ew.

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.560
Okay, that was not good.

01:15:57.269 --> 01:15:58.557
Okay, you know what--

01:15:58.557 --> 01:15:59.390
- Hold on.

01:15:59.390 --> 01:16:00.797
What just happened here?

01:16:00.797 --> 01:16:03.349
- I think we're witnessing
some butterfly effects.

01:16:03.349 --> 01:16:06.182
- Yeah, somehow killing Dr. Fantom

01:16:07.877 --> 01:16:11.450
made Jayden and Diane
fall in love earlier.

01:16:11.450 --> 01:16:12.283
- Well...

01:16:13.172 --> 01:16:14.372
We did it.

01:16:14.372 --> 01:16:15.570
- You did it.

01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:17.321
- We all did.

01:16:17.321 --> 01:16:18.404
Good job man.

01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:21.093
