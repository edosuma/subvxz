WEBVTT

00:03.222 --> 00:04.748
Everything okay in there, Bones?

00:04.749 --> 00:05.948
You need any help?

00:05.984 --> 00:07.383
BRENNAN:
I'm urinating on a stick.

00:07.418 --> 00:09.418
I think I can do that by myself.
Of course.

00:09.454 --> 00:10.886
I don't think
these things are very accurate.

00:10.922 --> 00:12.488
You're sure
these things are accurate?

00:12.523 --> 00:13.656
Very.

00:13.691 --> 00:15.024
Amazing you can
be so calm.

00:15.059 --> 00:17.259
You know, we might be
having another kid!

00:17.295 --> 00:19.762
Well, I like to wait until
I have all the facts before

00:19.797 --> 00:21.430
I become either
excited or disappointed.

00:21.466 --> 00:23.432
Ah, that's just weird, you know.
I knew it wasn't

00:23.468 --> 00:25.434
just because of those peanut
butter cookies that you love.

00:25.470 --> 00:27.003
It could still be that, Booth.
Hey, do me a favor.

00:27.038 --> 00:28.671
Shake the stick a little bit,
maybe hurry it up.

00:28.706 --> 00:29.905
It takes a couple
minutes, Booth.

00:29.941 --> 00:31.240
(exhales)
Right.

00:31.275 --> 00:35.277
Ah, I know exactly
when this happened, huh?

00:35.313 --> 00:37.179
It was the kitchen floor night

00:37.215 --> 00:38.681
after the bottle
of Brunello.

00:38.716 --> 00:40.583
If I am pregnant,
it'll be quite difficult

00:40.618 --> 00:42.184
to determine when we conceived

00:42.220 --> 00:43.986
based on the amount of sex
we've been having lately.

00:44.022 --> 00:45.821
That's very true. Very true.

00:45.857 --> 00:47.656
(both laugh)

00:47.692 --> 00:50.092
(cell phone ringing)
All right.

00:50.128 --> 00:51.460
Booth.

00:51.496 --> 00:53.429
Yeah.

00:53.464 --> 00:55.197
Right. Okay. Got it.

00:55.233 --> 00:58.267
So they found a body in an
industrial shredder. Ugh, man.

00:58.302 --> 00:59.535
Cam's gonna take the new intern,

00:59.570 --> 01:01.237
so you can just go
right to the lab.

01:01.272 --> 01:02.772
I can go if there are...
No, you cannot.

01:02.807 --> 01:03.973
It's too many chemicals.

01:04.007 --> 01:05.373
You're pregnant.
Booth, we have

01:05.410 --> 01:07.209
no factual evidence yet
that I am pregnant.

01:07.245 --> 01:10.212
You know, Christine-- she's
gonna be a great big sister.

01:10.248 --> 01:11.447
I'm gonna reserve comment
until...

01:11.482 --> 01:13.182
I know, until you have
all the facts.

01:13.217 --> 01:16.352
You know, back room-- gonna
turn it into the new nursery.

01:16.387 --> 01:17.920
(screams)
What?!

01:17.955 --> 01:19.755
Yes! What?!
A plus sign!

01:19.791 --> 01:21.557
I'm pregnant!
We're having a baby!

01:21.592 --> 01:22.858
We're having a baby.

01:22.894 --> 01:25.294
(Booth shouting)
We're having a baby!

01:25.329 --> 01:26.962
And I can keep eating cookies!

01:26.998 --> 01:29.131
Yes, cookies!
I'm so happy.

01:30.568 --> 01:31.767
Very happy.
(laughs)

01:31.803 --> 01:33.069
You're pregnant.
We're pregnant!

01:33.104 --> 01:34.837
I got to tell people. Huh?
No, no, no.

01:34.872 --> 01:36.439
This should be between us now.

01:36.474 --> 01:38.441
I want to wait
before we tell other people.

01:38.476 --> 01:40.716
Of course, yeah, definitely.
That's, that's really smart.

01:42.880 --> 01:45.047
So, okay, just listen to me
in there, all right?

01:45.083 --> 01:46.582
We can't tell anyone.

01:46.617 --> 01:48.551
We're going to
our first crime scene, baby.

01:48.586 --> 01:50.519
We're going to our first
crime scene!

01:50.555 --> 01:52.888
No, no, no, no, we're not going
to the first crime--<i> I'm</i> going.

01:52.924 --> 01:54.190
Booth, come on...
Ah.

01:54.225 --> 01:55.991
Ah, you're gonna
take it easy, Mom.

01:56.027 --> 01:57.493
I'm not taking it easy.

02:00.832 --> 02:02.231
Dr. Hodgins, I just...

02:02.266 --> 02:03.266
(glass shatters)

02:03.301 --> 02:04.433
No, no, no, no, no!

02:04.469 --> 02:06.035
(alarm blares)

02:06.871 --> 02:09.270
What just happened?
Huh?

02:09.306 --> 02:11.073
Oh, no, I just...

02:11.109 --> 02:13.576
I exposed
a cryogenic refrigerant.

02:13.611 --> 02:15.311
I mean, the safety
system is being

02:15.346 --> 02:18.013
a little dramatic;
it's not that toxic.

02:18.049 --> 02:20.216
Side note:
I need a requisition form

02:20.251 --> 02:22.251
for another
20 Berzelius beakers.

02:22.286 --> 02:23.853
Those are $150 apiece.

02:23.888 --> 02:26.655
I assume this experiment's
for the Jeffersonian?

02:26.691 --> 02:29.558
I mean, since my work
is my life,

02:29.594 --> 02:32.595
in essence, everything I do
is for the Jeffersonian?

02:32.630 --> 02:33.963
That would be a no.

02:33.998 --> 02:35.531
I know you love to

02:35.566 --> 02:36.966
invent things, Dr. Hodgins,

02:37.001 --> 02:39.335
but you do not have permission
to do that here.

02:39.370 --> 02:42.705
Confine that aspect of your life
to your home, please.

02:42.740 --> 02:44.273
Is that clear?

02:44.308 --> 02:46.108
Sure. Sure.

02:46.144 --> 02:48.077
So you came to
tell me something?

02:48.112 --> 02:49.912
Ah, yes.
We have to dig remains

02:49.947 --> 02:51.447
out of an industrial shredder.

02:51.482 --> 02:54.216
Oh, good. I thought it was
gonna be something bad.

02:59.657 --> 03:00.823
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

03:00.858 --> 03:02.224
(camera clicking)

03:02.260 --> 03:03.459
(siren whoops)

03:11.536 --> 03:13.936
Based on the head of
this beautifully formed femur

03:13.971 --> 03:16.338
and auricular surface
of the ilium,

03:16.374 --> 03:18.774
the victim was a white male
in his 30s.

03:18.809 --> 03:21.377
Beautifully formed?
It is. Look at it.

03:21.412 --> 03:23.412
HODGINS: There's no sign
of blowfly larvae,

03:23.447 --> 03:24.780
beautiful or not, which means

03:24.815 --> 03:26.315
the victim died
within the last 24 hours.

03:26.350 --> 03:27.516
BOOTH:
Hey, look at that!

03:27.552 --> 03:28.517
Coffee all around. I got coffee.

03:28.553 --> 03:29.885
Thank you, sir. Coffee, coffee?

03:29.921 --> 03:31.587
Hey, nice, huh? Get some coffee.

03:31.622 --> 03:32.988
I got some cream, some sugar.

03:33.024 --> 03:34.957
There you go. Grab the top one.
There you go.

03:34.992 --> 03:37.193
Hey, guys, look,
I got some coffee, huh?

03:37.228 --> 03:39.128
Got some cream and sugar. Tell
you what, your hands are full,

03:39.163 --> 03:41.030
so I'll tell you what,
I'll put the coffee

03:41.065 --> 03:42.298
right over here
by the nice black gloves.

03:42.333 --> 03:43.365
Thanks, Booth.
Yeah.

03:43.401 --> 03:44.466
How thoughtful.

03:44.502 --> 03:45.834
And unexpected.

03:45.870 --> 03:47.603
Well, it's a great
day to celebrate.

03:47.638 --> 03:50.506
You know, just a job
well done by everyone.

03:50.541 --> 03:52.141
You, you, great!

03:52.176 --> 03:53.375
Look at you.

03:53.411 --> 03:54.877
You all do such a good job.

03:54.912 --> 03:55.912
And bug boy--

03:55.913 --> 03:57.947
number one in my book.

03:57.982 --> 04:00.182
WARREN: Okay. Yeah, thanks.
BOOTH: Yeah.

04:00.218 --> 04:01.250
Yeah.
Uh, do you even

04:01.285 --> 04:02.685
know what my name is?

04:02.720 --> 04:05.354
Yeah, yeah. You do a
great job there, Squinty.

04:05.389 --> 04:07.289
I mean, I call
everyone Squinty.

04:07.325 --> 04:08.924
Squint your eyes
like that.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.693
Good job. You're doing great.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.628
Okay, then. Hey.

04:12.663 --> 04:14.396
Looks like a piece
of the victim's cell phone.

04:14.432 --> 04:16.232
Hopefully, it's enough
for Angie to work with.

04:16.267 --> 04:19.969
The yellow discoloration on the
victim's lacerations indicate

04:20.004 --> 04:21.370
he died before he was shredded.

04:21.404 --> 04:23.072
So the body was dumped.
BOOTH: Well, I tell you,

04:23.107 --> 04:24.340
the front lock was picked,

04:24.375 --> 04:25.975
so that rules out
all the employees.

04:26.010 --> 04:27.776
Look at bug boy go, huh?

04:27.812 --> 04:29.311
He looks like he's flossing.

04:29.347 --> 04:31.213
Yeah, well, there's teeth

04:31.249 --> 04:34.383
on these grinders,
so it seemed appropriate.

04:34.418 --> 04:36.218
The ones in the back
are hardest to reach.

04:36.254 --> 04:39.288
(laughing): You crack me up,
bug boy. He's...

04:39.323 --> 04:40.956
Okay, I got to say, I'm getting

04:40.992 --> 04:42.992
a little freaked out
by all the compliments.

04:43.027 --> 04:44.560
I found the victim's skull.

04:44.595 --> 04:46.262
Oh, wow, look at that, huh?

04:46.297 --> 04:48.197
That guy went through
the blender.

04:48.232 --> 04:49.265
Shredder.

04:49.300 --> 04:51.066
Uh, most of
the bony protrusions

04:51.102 --> 04:52.801
of the skull
have been removed.

04:52.837 --> 04:54.637
No chin, no cheeks, no brow.

04:54.672 --> 04:56.739
Angela will have
a hard time IDing him.

04:56.774 --> 04:58.474
Think I found something
that'll help Angie

04:58.509 --> 05:00.109
recreate the victim's face.

05:00.144 --> 05:01.477
What's that?

05:02.346 --> 05:04.480
The victim's face.

Okay, I filled in the missing
facial markers with clay.

05:49.346 --> 05:52.969
And I am almost finished
with the victim's face.

05:53.069 --> 05:55.236
MONTENEGRO:
Very cool. You just sewed up

05:55.272 --> 05:58.139
what the shredder ripped apart,
Franken-style.

05:58.175 --> 06:00.108
Can you hold
the skull steady?

06:00.143 --> 06:02.577
Mm-hmm, sure.

06:06.917 --> 06:09.317
This is so
<i>Mission: Impossible.</i>

06:09.352 --> 06:10.552
Perfect fit.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.220
He was killed
less than a day ago,

06:12.255 --> 06:14.155
so he probably hasn't been
reported missing yet.

06:14.191 --> 06:15.924
Yeah, and the clay is
just an approximation,

06:15.959 --> 06:18.092
so a match might
be a long shot.

06:18.128 --> 06:22.063
But I'll scan it and see if
I can come up with something.

06:22.098 --> 06:24.165
Looks like he worked
with his hands.

06:24.201 --> 06:26.234
Yes, and I see evidence
of Schmorl's nodes

06:26.269 --> 06:27.468
on the victim's spine.

06:27.504 --> 06:29.003
I'm gonna need help with...

06:29.039 --> 06:30.305
Schmorl's nodes.

06:30.340 --> 06:32.140
WARREN: Uh, named for
the German pathologist

06:32.175 --> 06:34.876
C.G. Schmorl, they are
protrusions of cartilage

06:34.911 --> 06:37.111
compressed into the vertebrae.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.613
Fairly common
in the elderly.

06:38.648 --> 06:39.681
Yes!

06:39.716 --> 06:41.282
Wonderful, Ms. Warren.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.651
You are quite
an exceptional intern.

06:43.687 --> 06:45.320
SAROYAN:
Wow.

06:45.355 --> 06:46.688
You and Booth are very cheery.

06:46.723 --> 06:48.356
No more than usual.

06:48.391 --> 06:49.657
For someone this young,

06:49.693 --> 06:51.192
the Schmorl's indicate

06:51.228 --> 06:53.494
that he spent a lot of time
carrying heavy objects.

06:53.530 --> 06:55.490
I found cardboard residue
on the victim's clothes,

06:55.498 --> 06:57.865
from the inside of his shirt
and under the arms,

06:57.901 --> 07:00.468
so it's not from recycled boxes
in the shredder.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.769
I'm getting a vibe.

07:01.805 --> 07:03.171
Yes, Ms. Warren?

07:03.206 --> 07:04.839
Yes? To my vibe?

07:04.874 --> 07:06.541
BRENNAN:
I'm feeling generous.

07:06.576 --> 07:08.409
Think of it
as theorizing.

07:08.445 --> 07:09.978
That'd be a first.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.146
Um, he might've worked
for a moving company,

07:12.182 --> 07:14.282
based on the markers
as well as the vibe.

07:14.317 --> 07:17.485
That's quite possible.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.187
Your good mood
just keeps getting better.

07:19.222 --> 07:20.588
Yeah, freaky.

07:20.624 --> 07:21.723
In a good way.

07:21.758 --> 07:23.691
Hey, Brennan,

07:23.727 --> 07:25.026
can I talk to you for a minute?

07:25.061 --> 07:26.661
Of course.

07:28.565 --> 07:29.964
Is everything all right?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.533
Yeah, I... I just am having
one of those days.

07:32.569 --> 07:34.469
I feel like I need a hug.

07:34.504 --> 07:37.038
I don't know what that means,
but of course I'll embrace you.

07:37.941 --> 07:39.707
Ow. Ow.
I knew it.

07:39.743 --> 07:41.509
You knew what?
Sore boobs.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.844
You're pregnant.
What?

07:42.879 --> 07:44.612
No, I'm not...

07:44.648 --> 07:46.214
Don't start with the
sweet tooth thing again.

07:46.249 --> 07:48.683
Needing to exercise
does not explain why

07:48.718 --> 07:50.685
everybody is saying that
you are in such a good mood.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.487
I'm always in a good mood.

07:52.522 --> 07:53.888
It's funny that you
actually believe that.

07:53.923 --> 07:56.024
This is such great news!
Please, Angela,

07:56.059 --> 07:57.692
I don't want everyone to know,
not yet.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.594
All right, I'll stick with
the sweet tooth thing.

07:59.629 --> 08:01.629
But in the meantime...

08:01.665 --> 08:02.964
Ow, ow, ow.

08:02.999 --> 08:04.565
Oh, yeah. Boobs.

08:04.601 --> 08:06.134
(computer chimes)

08:06.169 --> 08:07.735
You found a match?

08:07.771 --> 08:10.605
Yeah, uh... 12 matches.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.240
I ran my reconstruction

08:12.275 --> 08:14.342
against online images-- it's
the only thing I could do.

08:14.377 --> 08:15.710
Can you perform

08:15.745 --> 08:17.412
a vocational search
to see if any of them

08:17.447 --> 08:20.281
worked as a mover
or delivery man?

08:20.317 --> 08:22.283
Yeah, let me check it out.

08:24.187 --> 08:25.320
Down to one.

08:25.355 --> 08:28.656
Jeff Dover, worked
as a mover at Oz

08:28.692 --> 08:30.992
Storage and Moving.

08:32.294 --> 08:33.660
Excuse me.

08:33.697 --> 08:34.861
Yeah, one second.

08:34.898 --> 08:36.831
Darren, I need you
on truck three.

08:36.866 --> 08:38.633
The house is not
gonna move itself.

08:38.668 --> 08:39.668
Yeah?

08:39.703 --> 08:40.902
What can I do you for?

08:40.937 --> 08:42.136
Agent Aubrey.
I'm with the FBI.

08:42.172 --> 08:43.837
Jayne Barry. I'm the manager.

08:43.873 --> 08:45.173
Who complained this time?

08:45.208 --> 08:46.407
No one.

08:46.443 --> 08:47.875
I need to ask you
a few questions

08:47.911 --> 08:50.244
about one of
your employees.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.513
A, uh, Jeff Dover.
Is he in some kind of trouble?

08:52.549 --> 08:54.615
Because he did not
show up for work today.

08:54.651 --> 08:57.118
Jeff was murdered.

08:57.987 --> 09:00.455
Oh, my God.

09:00.490 --> 09:02.190
Now, can you think of

09:02.225 --> 09:05.660
any coworkers or clients who
might have had it out for Jeff?

09:05.695 --> 09:08.463
Not off the top of my...

09:08.498 --> 09:09.664
Wait.

09:09.699 --> 09:11.132
Wait, what?

09:11.167 --> 09:13.634
He got into a screaming match
the other day

09:13.670 --> 09:15.670
with another mover, Dustin West.

09:15.705 --> 09:16.971
It was during a job.

09:17.006 --> 09:18.606
Clients complained,
I had to reimburse them.

09:18.641 --> 09:21.576
Can you tell me where
Dustin West is right now?

09:21.611 --> 09:23.344
Uh, yeah. He's moving
a house in Treesdale.

09:23.380 --> 09:24.812
I can give you the address.

09:24.848 --> 09:27.348
Thanks.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.486
There are multiple antemortem
fractures of the pelvis,

09:31.521 --> 09:33.755
as well as oblique fractures
of the femur.

09:33.790 --> 09:36.124
So he was in a fight
before he was killed.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.993
Remodeling indicates
it happened about two years ago,

09:39.028 --> 09:41.829
so these injuries
aren't related to his death.

09:41.865 --> 09:44.832
I heard you broke
some more beakers, Curly.

09:44.868 --> 09:46.200
More beakers?

09:46.236 --> 09:47.835
You broke some
just two weeks ago.

09:47.871 --> 09:49.337
No, those were flasks.

09:49.372 --> 09:50.838
Didn't you also
break some vials?

09:50.874 --> 09:52.440
Ah, yeah, but that was,
like, three weeks ago.

09:52.475 --> 09:53.574
You are aware that all of this

09:53.610 --> 09:54.876
comes out of
your paycheck, right?

09:54.911 --> 09:56.878
Uh, no, I was not aware.

09:56.913 --> 09:59.213
Shake it off, Curly.
There's a lesson here.

09:59.249 --> 10:01.082
Yeah, you break it,
you bought it.

10:01.117 --> 10:02.850
Uh, no. My cooperative

10:02.886 --> 10:04.852
would encourage us
to examine any mistakes

10:04.888 --> 10:06.654
for hidden wisdom.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.623
You should totally invent
an unbreakable beaker.

10:08.658 --> 10:10.425
SAROYAN: But they already
have plastic beakers.

10:10.460 --> 10:12.193
But glass is easier
to sterilize.

10:12.228 --> 10:14.595
(chuckles)
Have some vision, Dr. Saroyan.

10:14.631 --> 10:16.697
She's right. Plus,
some solvents can

10:16.733 --> 10:19.667
dissolve plastics, and some
plastics are gas-permeable.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.103
An unbreakable
glass beaker.

10:22.138 --> 10:25.006
Oh, now, look, you've gone
and made him all inspired.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.874
Oh. Uh-oh.

10:26.910 --> 10:28.242
I know that look.

10:28.278 --> 10:29.577
Unbreakable beaker.

10:29.612 --> 10:31.078
It's my fault.

10:31.114 --> 10:33.347
Okay, well, then you can
clean up the mess, sweetie.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.516
So, there was enough
of the motherboard left

10:35.552 --> 10:37.285
to hack into
Dover's cell phone,

10:37.320 --> 10:39.020
and it was filled
with poker apps.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.254
SAROYAN:
I don't understand.

10:40.290 --> 10:41.522
Lots of people like
to play poker.

10:41.558 --> 10:42.824
Yeah, but not
this much.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.725
He had accounts
on multiple poker sites,

10:44.761 --> 10:47.595
and it seems like
a lot of money changed hands.

10:47.630 --> 10:49.397
So our victim was a gambler.

10:49.432 --> 10:50.731
(glass shatters)

10:52.735 --> 10:54.302
Dr. Hodgins?

10:54.337 --> 10:55.503
HODGINS:
Yeah.

10:55.538 --> 10:56.637
Just trying a little something.

10:56.673 --> 10:58.005
I'll clean it up.

10:58.041 --> 10:59.807
Later.

11:02.612 --> 11:04.779
So, Mr. West,
the recycling center confirms

11:04.814 --> 11:07.081
you've been there
multiple times.

11:07.116 --> 11:08.349
It's, uh,
pretty coincidental

11:08.384 --> 11:09.884
that Jeff Dover
was dumped there.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.186
Every mover in town
knows that place.

11:12.222 --> 11:14.922
We get asked to throw away
old junk all the time.

11:14.958 --> 11:16.991
But we have witnesses
who saw you two fighting

11:17.026 --> 11:19.060
before he disappeared.
Sure,

11:19.095 --> 11:21.028
we had a big blowout.
But I didn't kill him.

11:21.064 --> 11:23.164
Blowout about what?

11:23.199 --> 11:25.132
Gambling?

11:25.168 --> 11:26.501
How'd you know?

11:26.536 --> 11:28.436
BOOTH:
You owed him money.

11:28.471 --> 11:30.805
You guys play in the same game?

11:32.775 --> 11:33.908
He owed me money, yeah,

11:33.943 --> 11:35.343
but we played
in different games.

11:35.378 --> 11:36.944
Mine were low-rent games
with friends.

11:36.980 --> 11:38.779
Jeff, he was
in deep.

11:38.815 --> 11:42.116
High-stakes underground games.

11:44.821 --> 11:46.087
So you bankrolled him

11:46.122 --> 11:48.189
and you split
the winnings.

11:48.224 --> 11:49.957
That was the plan.

11:49.993 --> 11:51.425
(sighs)
I loaned him ten grand,

11:51.461 --> 11:52.693
but he couldn't
pay me back

11:52.729 --> 11:54.061
and I needed the cash.
AUBREY: Who ran the game

11:54.097 --> 11:55.897
that he played in?
I don't know.

11:55.932 --> 11:57.632
I don't want to get involved
in that world, okay?

11:57.667 --> 11:58.833
BOOTH:
You're in it deep now,

11:58.868 --> 12:00.101
and if you don't cooperate,

12:00.136 --> 12:01.369
I'm gonna have to lock you up

12:01.404 --> 12:03.337
for obstructing
a murder investigation.

12:05.108 --> 12:07.208
Oh, man...

12:07.243 --> 12:08.976
I don't know whose game it was.

12:09.012 --> 12:10.478
Okay? But I did
drop him off there

12:10.513 --> 12:11.779
every once
in a while.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.848
Corner of
Beachwood and Allegheny.

12:13.883 --> 12:15.116
Last night, by any chance?

12:15.151 --> 12:17.218
Yeah.
He sent me a text

12:17.253 --> 12:18.786
saying he'd won the big one.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.354
Pot worth 28 grand.

12:20.390 --> 12:21.722
AUBREY: So let me get
this straight.

12:21.758 --> 12:23.624
He tells you
that he just won

12:23.660 --> 12:26.294
28 grand, then he
suddenly disappears

12:26.329 --> 12:28.729
and shows up dead
without a penny.

12:28.765 --> 12:31.032
That doesn't look good for you.

12:36.463 --> 12:37.629
Dr. Hodgins has
yet to find

12:37.664 --> 12:39.566
any evidence of money
in the shredder.

12:39.567 --> 12:41.100
That's because Dover was killed
for his winnings.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.368
Which means

12:42.403 --> 12:43.702
that all of the players

12:43.738 --> 12:45.905
in his underground game
are suspects.

12:45.940 --> 12:47.273
Yes, it sure is.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.841
Very smart, Bones.

12:48.876 --> 12:51.377
Did you ever play in games
like that when you gambled?

12:51.412 --> 12:52.745
Bones...
(chuckles)

12:52.780 --> 12:54.780
I gambled on everything.
Poker, ponies...

12:54.816 --> 12:58.684
I even bet on the expiration
date of a package of cheese.

12:58.719 --> 13:01.487
Maybe you...

13:01.522 --> 13:03.422
shouldn't be involved
in this case.

13:03.458 --> 13:05.224
Gambling
clearly releases

13:05.259 --> 13:07.993
dopamine in your nucleus accumbens.
I'm gonna be fine.

13:08.029 --> 13:11.163
Okay? My sponsor's
just a phone call away.

13:11.199 --> 13:12.431
All right?
I can handle this.

13:12.467 --> 13:14.033
Aubrey said...
Please. Aubrey. Okay?

13:14.068 --> 13:16.135
That's not his world.
This is my world, okay?

13:16.170 --> 13:18.003
I'm not going to let
a murderer go free

13:18.039 --> 13:21.407
because everyone is afraid
I'm not strong enough, here.

13:24.278 --> 13:26.812
I want to believe you...
Look.

13:26.848 --> 13:29.281
I gambled in the past
because my life was a mess.

13:29.317 --> 13:31.050
It was a complete disaster.
I mean, come on.

13:31.085 --> 13:33.686
Now I have you, I got Christine,
I got Parker, I got...

13:33.721 --> 13:34.987
(whispering):
...little guy on the way.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.689
Guy?
Yes, guy.

13:36.724 --> 13:38.123
It's just a hunch.
I'm not going to throw it

13:38.159 --> 13:39.458
all away over a poker game.

13:39.494 --> 13:40.793
Come on, Bones.

13:40.828 --> 13:42.294
Look who it is!
Hey!

13:42.330 --> 13:44.263
Booth!
Here he is! Jason Samuels. How are you?

13:44.298 --> 13:45.898
Man, you look good, huh?
Listen, have a seat.

13:45.933 --> 13:47.433
This is my wife,
Temperance Brennan.

13:47.468 --> 13:50.269
Temperance Brennan, <i>the</i> Jason Samuels.
(laughs)

13:50.304 --> 13:51.304
This is your wife?
Yeah.

13:51.305 --> 13:52.638
(whistles)

13:52.673 --> 13:54.540
For an ex-gambler,
it looks like you, uh,

13:54.575 --> 13:56.208
won the lottery, Booth.
You bet.

13:56.244 --> 13:57.443
BRENNAN:
You were Booth's

13:57.478 --> 13:59.411
gambling facilitator?

13:59.447 --> 14:01.447
It sounds so much
better than "bookie."

14:01.482 --> 14:03.249
Right, listen.
I-I need your help.

14:04.285 --> 14:06.652
What?
Well, it's just that...

14:06.687 --> 14:08.120
I know what you do

14:08.155 --> 14:09.822
and you know what I do.

14:09.857 --> 14:11.423
Look, I'm trying to catch
a murderer, here, all right?

14:11.459 --> 14:12.658
I don't care about the gambling.

14:12.693 --> 14:14.059
Your name's never gonna come up.

14:15.630 --> 14:17.329
How can I help?

14:17.365 --> 14:18.631
Look, I need to get
into a poker game

14:18.666 --> 14:19.932
at Beachwood and Allegheny.

14:19.967 --> 14:21.200
Are you going to play?

14:21.235 --> 14:22.668
Yeah.

14:22.703 --> 14:24.770
You sure about this, Booth?

14:24.805 --> 14:26.205
BOOTH:
Pros in a game like this,

14:26.240 --> 14:27.606
they know how to bluff.

14:27.642 --> 14:29.441
They bluff for a living, right?

14:29.477 --> 14:30.676
If I get in there,

14:30.711 --> 14:32.411
in that game,
and learn their tells,

14:32.446 --> 14:34.480
and one of those guys
is the killer...

14:34.515 --> 14:36.148
case closed, game over.

14:36.183 --> 14:37.850
It's real simple.

14:42.023 --> 14:44.189
WARREN:
<i>I found a perimortem</i>

14:44.225 --> 14:45.858
depression fracture

14:45.893 --> 14:48.928
on the victim's
left temporal bone.

14:48.963 --> 14:50.429
BRENNAN:
The fracture pattern indicates

14:50.464 --> 14:51.797
that the blunt force trauma
was caused

14:51.832 --> 14:53.732
by a cylindrical weapon.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.968
However, this did not
kill the victim.

14:56.003 --> 14:58.370
So I have to find something
even more violent.

14:58.406 --> 14:59.705
Delightful.

14:59.740 --> 15:01.407
Hey. So I found this

15:01.442 --> 15:03.099
mixed in with the leftovers
of the shredded remains.

15:03.100 --> 15:05.233
Ooh! A coin.
Oh, it's scratched up

15:05.413 --> 15:06.712
pretty good.

15:06.747 --> 15:08.113
I can only make out
part of a symbol.

15:08.149 --> 15:09.615
Well, I know
it's not U.S. currency.

15:09.650 --> 15:12.017
It's not foreign currency,
either.

15:12.053 --> 15:14.853
Booth has one of these.

15:14.889 --> 15:17.222
It's a sobriety token
from Gamblers Anonymous.

15:17.258 --> 15:18.457
HODGINS:
Well, it looks like our victim

15:18.492 --> 15:19.792
fell off the wagon.

15:19.827 --> 15:22.127
And into a shredder.

15:29.437 --> 15:31.637
Hey.

15:31.672 --> 15:34.073
So, the injuries that Jeff Dover
got two years ago

15:34.108 --> 15:35.841
were from a bad car accident.

15:35.876 --> 15:37.509
Wife and kid both died
in the crash.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.578
Probably started gambling
after he lost his family.

15:39.614 --> 15:40.846
And he tried to stop.

15:40.881 --> 15:43.215
But couldn't.

15:43.250 --> 15:44.950
Right.
Which is exactly why

15:44.986 --> 15:46.485
you're not going
to play in that game.

15:46.520 --> 15:47.886
No, it's exactly
why I am.

15:47.922 --> 15:49.588
Okay? He was fighting to...
to go straight

15:49.624 --> 15:50.904
and someone
took advantage of him

15:50.925 --> 15:52.157
when he was at his weakest.

15:52.193 --> 15:53.392
I'm going to make that right.

15:53.427 --> 15:54.693
It is not that simple, Booth.

15:54.729 --> 15:56.662
Look, Sweets was
very clear in your file.

15:56.697 --> 15:58.297
You gambled to cope
with trauma and that is...

15:58.332 --> 15:59.565
Look, Aubrey,
it's been a long time

15:59.600 --> 16:00.966
since I've been
in the Middle East.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.501
I'm not talking
about the Middle East.

16:02.536 --> 16:04.236
You've been shot
multiple times since then,

16:04.271 --> 16:05.504
you spent three months
in prison,

16:05.539 --> 16:07.059
and your best friend
died in your arms.

16:07.074 --> 16:09.308
Isn't that enough trauma
for you?

16:12.913 --> 16:15.214
Aubrey, look, I already talked
to Bones about this, okay?

16:15.249 --> 16:16.448
She's fine with it.

16:16.484 --> 16:17.950
I appreciate your concern,

16:17.985 --> 16:20.719
but this is gonna happen. Okay?

16:21.622 --> 16:23.188
Wow.

16:30.665 --> 16:32.197
Oh, hey!

16:32.233 --> 16:33.432
Jessica,
check this out.

16:33.467 --> 16:35.034
What is that,
a thigh?

16:35.069 --> 16:37.102
Nah. No, no, no.
Well, yeah, no, that's a thigh.

16:37.138 --> 16:38.437
I meant check this out.

16:38.472 --> 16:40.272
Ooh, is this for
the unbreakable beaker?

16:40.307 --> 16:42.041
Mm-hmm.
Whoa...

16:42.076 --> 16:44.677
Does, uh, Cam know
you're inventing again?

16:44.712 --> 16:46.232
She doesn't have to.
I made it at home.

16:46.247 --> 16:47.880
I set up a little lab
in the garage.

16:47.915 --> 16:49.848
Hey, there could be
a finder's fee in this for you.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.984
So it's a moldable rubber
cast in a unique

16:52.019 --> 16:53.252
honeycomb
structure.

16:53.287 --> 16:55.187
Inspired by bees?
Yeah, exactly.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.189
I used a high
silicon-to-cornstarch ratio

16:57.224 --> 16:59.024
so that the rubber's
extremely elastic.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.826
Obviously.
If you cover a beaker with this,

17:00.861 --> 17:03.128
you can drop it on the ground
without a scratch.

17:03.164 --> 17:04.930
Uh, but you can't heat it.

17:04.964 --> 17:06.165
That's kind of a big problem.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.099
Yeah.

17:08.135 --> 17:10.669
You could baby-proof
your house with it, though.

17:10.704 --> 17:12.003
Yeah.

17:12.039 --> 17:14.006
Oh! My God. That's it.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.273
What's it?

17:15.309 --> 17:17.108
I could...
I should be able to...

17:17.144 --> 17:18.377
Oh, my God.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.279
Yeah, that didn't clarify much.

17:20.314 --> 17:21.914
Hey, guys.
What's this?

17:21.949 --> 17:23.214
Good luck, Curly.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.650
Nothing. Just, you know,
a little something

17:24.685 --> 17:26.018
I brought from home.

17:26.053 --> 17:28.319
You keep dead men's
thighs in your house?

17:28.355 --> 17:29.555
Oh, this! Right.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.090
The victim's
left thigh.

17:31.125 --> 17:33.592
No, this is the last piece
of flesh that I found.

17:33.627 --> 17:34.860
Um, I mean, this
is the last piece

17:34.895 --> 17:36.161
of flesh that
I found here.

17:36.197 --> 17:38.130
Not at home.
Excellent.

17:38.165 --> 17:39.598
Oh, that is
so cool.

17:39.633 --> 17:40.833
Awesome, right?

17:40.868 --> 17:42.201
It's the victim's
left forearm

17:42.236 --> 17:44.369
and I already found
abrasions in this area,

17:44.405 --> 17:46.205
which I removed.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.474
Defensive wounds?
Uh, possibly.

17:48.509 --> 17:50.175
Hey, look at that.
It's covered with

17:50.211 --> 17:51.610
some kind of
oily substance.

17:51.645 --> 17:53.112
That could be from
the murder weapon.

17:53.147 --> 17:54.446
I'll trade you that thigh
for this forearm,

17:54.482 --> 17:55.814
if you can tell me
what he's coated in.

17:55.850 --> 17:57.182
(scoffs)
You got a deal.

17:57.218 --> 17:58.617
Thank you.

18:01.489 --> 18:02.888
So Aubrey
walked out?

18:02.923 --> 18:04.156
Look, he means well.

18:04.191 --> 18:05.657
Everyone means well, okay?
I know that.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.626
So he won't help?

18:07.661 --> 18:09.661
You need backup, Booth.
Uh, it's gonna be fine, okay?

18:09.697 --> 18:11.764
We talked.
I guess it's good that

18:11.799 --> 18:13.065
everyone's giving me
so much flak.

18:13.100 --> 18:15.501
I don't understand.

18:15.536 --> 18:18.103
Gives me something
to prove, right?

18:18.139 --> 18:20.939
Don't forget
how strong you are, Booth.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.307
Look...

18:22.343 --> 18:23.983
I already talked to my sponsor.
All right?

18:24.011 --> 18:25.878
Minute I get any kind
of information,

18:25.913 --> 18:28.180
I'm gonna text Aubrey and
I'm gonna text you right away.

18:28.215 --> 18:29.815
Okay.

18:29.850 --> 18:31.083
Be safe, Booth.

18:31.118 --> 18:32.284
Hey, I'm gonna be fine.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.019
Listen to me, all right?

18:34.054 --> 18:36.321
I know the signs,
I know the trigger points.

18:36.357 --> 18:37.823
I know myself.

18:37.858 --> 18:40.926
I know what it took
for me to hit rock bottom.

18:43.230 --> 18:45.898
You know what, I haven't
held cards in my hands

18:45.933 --> 18:47.766
for a long, long time.

18:47.802 --> 18:51.603
Because what we have here,
this life...

18:51.639 --> 18:54.473
it's better than any hand

18:54.508 --> 18:56.742
that I could ever be dealt.

18:59.380 --> 19:01.747
And look, look...
if I can't deal,

19:01.782 --> 19:03.182
if I have a problem,
what am I gonna do?

19:03.217 --> 19:04.516
I'm gonna get up
and I'm gonna walk away.

19:04.552 --> 19:05.784
That's how strong I am.

19:05.820 --> 19:07.586
Now look at me.
I promise.

these are the worst cards
I've seen all night.

20:17.713 --> 20:19.913
(scoffs): Said that three
times already

20:19.949 --> 20:21.348
and you won
every hand.

20:21.383 --> 20:22.783
Oh, I'll keep that in mind.
You know what?

20:22.818 --> 20:25.085
Now look at that.
$800 to call.

20:28.891 --> 20:31.124
Yeah, that's right, we
put an eye in the sky

20:31.160 --> 20:32.492
after we had some

20:32.528 --> 20:34.161
pretty crazy hands go down.
So, you know,

20:34.196 --> 20:35.929
play nice.
Thanks, Daddy, I will.

20:35.965 --> 20:37.798
ATM? $800 to call.

20:37.833 --> 20:39.466
ATM. $800 to call.

20:39.501 --> 20:41.368
Look, I understand
if you're scared.

20:41.403 --> 20:43.070
All you have
to say is,

20:43.105 --> 20:44.738
"I fold, because I am scared."

20:44.773 --> 20:46.807
(laughs)

20:46.842 --> 20:48.909
How about you, Mustache Man?
You want to dance?

20:48.944 --> 20:50.177
D'oh. Fold.

20:50.212 --> 20:52.446
Missy?
No, thanks.

20:52.481 --> 20:54.081
And the name's Gold Digger.

20:54.116 --> 20:55.849
Gold Digger.
I'll remember that.

20:55.884 --> 20:57.818
Okay. Fold, fold, fold.

20:57.853 --> 20:59.686
Beanie Man.
How about you? Huh?

20:59.722 --> 21:01.788
Oh! Look at that!

21:01.824 --> 21:03.824
Looks like I take
another monster hand.

21:03.859 --> 21:07.194
Had to protect that monster,
monster hand.

21:10.666 --> 21:12.332
Try that bluff again, tough guy.
I dare you.

21:12.368 --> 21:13.834
(chuckling):
Okay, I will.

21:13.869 --> 21:15.402
I'll try it next
time, thanks, pal.

21:16.805 --> 21:18.538
You know, I know
who you are, newbie.

21:19.441 --> 21:20.907
You know who I am?

21:20.943 --> 21:22.576
Really?

21:22.611 --> 21:25.145
You're that guy at the table

21:25.180 --> 21:26.620
that's yap, yap,
yapping his face off

21:26.649 --> 21:28.115
trying to get a
read on all of us.

21:28.150 --> 21:29.816
Amateur move, pal.

21:29.852 --> 21:31.618
"Amateur move," yeah, well,
I know who you are, too, pal.

21:31.654 --> 21:34.788
Being a table bully so
I, uh, bet more aggressive.

21:34.823 --> 21:37.024
Now,<i> that</i> is
an amateur move, pal.

21:37.059 --> 21:38.392
MAN:
Ah, don't worry, newbie,

21:38.427 --> 21:40.861
we call him ATM
'cause he pays out so much.

21:40.896 --> 21:42.996
That's funny every time
I hear it, Mid-Life.

21:43.032 --> 21:44.032
Mid-Life?

21:44.033 --> 21:45.499
As in midlife crisis.

21:45.534 --> 21:47.601
Mid-Life got a divorce,
bought a Corvette

21:47.636 --> 21:49.369
and started dating a stripper.

21:49.405 --> 21:51.305
And they're all jealous.
Jealous.

21:51.340 --> 21:53.540
The guy you called Mustache,
that is Johnny LaQuatra.

21:53.575 --> 21:55.575
Gold Digger over here,
she got herself

21:55.611 --> 21:58.278
a sweet settlement from
her billionaire old man,

21:58.314 --> 21:59.713
so she just can't wait
to lose it all.

21:59.748 --> 22:02.015
Gold Digger's a good name
for all you jackasses.

22:02.051 --> 22:03.383
(all chuckle)

22:03.419 --> 22:04.951
Tell you what,
they call me Freddy K.,

22:04.987 --> 22:07.187
but, hey, "Newbie"?
That is just fine.

22:07.222 --> 22:09.089
All right, look, I got
to go hit the head.

22:09.124 --> 22:10.124
Where's that located?

22:10.125 --> 22:11.258
Down there.

22:11.293 --> 22:12.526
Down there, thanks.

22:17.599 --> 22:19.900
(cell phone rings)
Hey.

22:19.935 --> 22:22.202
It's me; game has
an eye in the sky.

22:22.237 --> 22:24.705
You mean, like those ceiling
cameras in the casinos?

22:24.740 --> 22:26.606
Yeah, they got three cameras
in the ceilings

22:26.642 --> 22:28.709
recording all the action, just
in case there's an argument.

22:28.744 --> 22:30.243
You want to get
footage of the game

22:30.279 --> 22:31.645
the night the victim
was murdered.

22:31.680 --> 22:32.946
Exactly. Can you do it?

22:32.981 --> 22:34.541
I can hack into
the server's IP address,

22:34.550 --> 22:36.183
but I'll need to pair it
with your phone.

22:36.218 --> 22:38.552
Right, okay, so what do you
need me to do exactly?

22:38.587 --> 22:40.454
You need to get your phone
within a few feet

22:40.489 --> 22:41.822
of their security system.

22:41.857 --> 22:43.290
That's no problem,
just give me an hour.

22:43.325 --> 22:44.458
Okay.

22:46.261 --> 22:48.628
Let's bump it
to three hundo.

22:48.664 --> 22:51.431
Fold. Fold.

22:51.467 --> 22:53.600
Mid-Life folds.

22:53.635 --> 22:56.169
Fold. Action to Freddy K.

22:56.205 --> 22:57.771
We raise.

22:57.806 --> 23:00.507
Here's your three,
three on top.

23:01.643 --> 23:03.677
Enough with these
kiddie bets.

23:03.712 --> 23:04.911
(clears throat)

23:04.947 --> 23:07.914
Let's make it
three grand to stay.

23:07.950 --> 23:09.716
Wait, that's
a string bet.

23:09.752 --> 23:11.017
What?
That's illegal.

23:11.053 --> 23:12.253
You bet your money
in two moves

23:12.254 --> 23:13.520
before you announced
your bet.

23:13.555 --> 23:15.155
The hell I did.
You calling or not?

23:15.190 --> 23:16.356
Calling? Wait a second,
technically, you just called.

23:16.392 --> 23:18.225
You can't raise
on a string bet.

23:18.260 --> 23:20.360
N-N-No, I did not make a string bet.
HOST:Okay, guys, guys.

23:20.396 --> 23:21.796
Ah, you made
a string bet, y-y-yeah.

23:21.797 --> 23:23.163
HOST: Okay, guys, guys,
guys, settle down.

23:23.198 --> 23:24.498
I'm sorry,
I missed the action.

23:24.533 --> 23:25.899
Dealer, did you see
a string bet?

23:25.934 --> 23:28.235
Sorry, no.
Anybody else see it?

23:28.270 --> 23:30.337
Okay, nobody saw
a string bet, Freddy.

23:30.372 --> 23:32.472
Well, it was a string bet.
Okay, well, no one saw it.

23:32.508 --> 23:34.007
Look, y-you just, you want
to chop the pot?

23:34.042 --> 23:35.742
No, we're not gonna chop
the pot, not with this hand.

23:35.778 --> 23:36.778
I want to play out.

23:36.779 --> 23:37.878
I want to play this hand.

23:37.913 --> 23:39.112
I'll tell you what,
let's check the tape.

23:39.148 --> 23:41.214
How the hell did this
guy get in the game?

23:41.250 --> 23:42.840
I walked through the front door.
Pipe down, okay?

23:42.864 --> 23:44.252
The guy's got a right to see.

23:44.253 --> 23:45.385
Yeah, let's go check the tape.
All right, come on.

23:45.421 --> 23:46.853
Yeah, let's go
check the tape.

23:46.889 --> 23:48.255
Oh, sure,
sounds good to me.

23:50.359 --> 23:53.493
HOST: So we'll go through
all this footage to get to it.

23:55.831 --> 23:57.197
Uh, r-right there.

23:57.232 --> 23:59.966
I come out with
a $300 bet.

24:01.003 --> 24:02.969
Fold. Fold, fold.

24:03.005 --> 24:04.037
He raises.

24:04.072 --> 24:05.639
Right.

24:05.674 --> 24:06.840
Okay, right there,
Th-there.

24:06.875 --> 24:08.175
Now I'm debating
his raise.

24:08.210 --> 24:10.410
And you're about
to make a string bet.

24:10.446 --> 24:12.979
I did not make a string bet.

24:13.015 --> 24:14.481
Yeah, you did, you made...

24:14.516 --> 24:15.882
Uh, play the hand again, huh?
Play it again.

24:15.918 --> 24:17.417
Why? We can see
everything just fine.

24:17.453 --> 24:19.252
Just go back,
just play it again.

24:22.658 --> 24:24.090
Ooh, r-right there, right there.

24:24.126 --> 24:25.859
That's a legal bet!

24:27.596 --> 24:29.029
One forward motion.

24:30.466 --> 24:31.466
Bite me, Freddy!

24:31.467 --> 24:32.999
You're right, I'm sorry.

24:33.035 --> 24:34.167
I-I made a mistake.

24:34.203 --> 24:35.769
You know what,
take down the pot.

24:35.804 --> 24:37.304
Absolutely.

24:37.339 --> 24:38.772
I'm really sorry.

24:38.807 --> 24:40.140
Tool bag.

24:40.175 --> 24:41.308
Sorry about that.

24:41.343 --> 24:42.442
Sorry.

24:43.412 --> 24:44.845
Ooh, okay, we're in.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.646
It looks like all three
feeds are active.

24:46.682 --> 24:48.048
And this is live?

24:48.083 --> 24:49.816
Yeah. Look, you
can see Booth

24:49.852 --> 24:51.585
sitting back down
at the table now.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.053
And it looks
like he's winning.

24:53.088 --> 24:55.055
I don't know if that's
a good or bad thing.

24:55.090 --> 24:56.723
Him just being there is bad,

24:56.758 --> 24:59.259
so let's try to wrap this one up
as quick as possible.

24:59.294 --> 25:01.428
Well, this system records
a trailing window of 72 hours.

25:01.463 --> 25:03.363
So you should be able
to get the footage

25:03.398 --> 25:05.699
of the game the night
Jeff Dover was murdered.

25:05.734 --> 25:08.201
Yeah, I'm already
downloading it.

25:15.110 --> 25:17.143
Do you have the swab results
from the victim's forearm yet?

25:17.179 --> 25:19.980
I am pulling
them up now.

25:20.015 --> 25:21.748
What's this?

25:21.783 --> 25:26.119
It's a rubber honeycomb polymer
I made at home on my own time,

25:26.154 --> 25:27.954
I didn't work on at all
here at the Jeffersonian,

25:27.990 --> 25:29.890
and it has not interfered
with this case at all.

25:29.925 --> 25:31.191
Good.

25:31.226 --> 25:32.425
Now, what have you got?

25:32.461 --> 25:34.761
Right, so the victim's
arm contained

25:34.796 --> 25:36.530
a composition
of lauric,

25:36.565 --> 25:39.232
myristic, palmitic,
capric, stearic...

25:39.268 --> 25:41.668
Impressive details, but I've
got stuff to do, Dr. Hodgins.

25:41.703 --> 25:44.070
Yes, so it's the fatty
acid composition

25:44.106 --> 25:45.739
of a palm oil
often used in cooking.

25:45.774 --> 25:47.641
Everything from salad dressing
to baked goods.

25:55.384 --> 25:57.317
Hey, Bones.

25:57.352 --> 25:59.386
What are you doing
up so late?

25:59.421 --> 26:00.320
Couldn't sleep.

26:00.355 --> 26:02.122
Ah, it was
a crazy night.

26:02.157 --> 26:03.623
Sorry. It's so good
to see you.

26:03.659 --> 26:05.559
I didn't think you'd
be home so late.

26:05.594 --> 26:07.027
I know, me neither,

26:07.062 --> 26:09.262
but I made a lot
of progress on the case.

26:12.301 --> 26:14.067
This...

26:14.102 --> 26:16.703
This looks like a lot more than
the $5,000 you started with.

26:16.738 --> 26:18.605
12. Played
for a while.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.173
I wasn't aware

26:20.208 --> 26:22.375
that winning big was
a necessary part of your cover.

26:22.411 --> 26:24.377
Bones, I got to look
like I belong.

26:24.413 --> 26:26.446
Everyone there's about winning,
you know? So...

26:27.749 --> 26:29.783
And you checked in
with your sponsor?

26:29.818 --> 26:31.985
That's between
me and him.

26:32.020 --> 26:33.587
So you haven't.

26:33.622 --> 26:34.988
You said that
you would.

26:35.023 --> 26:36.756
Okay, I talked to him
on the way back here.

26:36.792 --> 26:38.425
Why do I feel like I'm being interrogated?
I'm just wondering

26:38.460 --> 26:40.527
if it was necessary
for you to play this late.

26:40.562 --> 26:42.162
If it wasn't necessary,
I wouldn't have done it.

26:42.197 --> 26:43.597
You know what? I don't like
this conversation.

26:43.632 --> 26:44.931
I was reading one
of Sweets' books...

26:44.967 --> 26:46.299
Sweets?

26:46.335 --> 26:47.968
Uh, let's stop
with that one, okay?

26:48.003 --> 26:49.970
In it, it-it says

26:50.005 --> 26:51.938
that any big emotional change,
even good,

26:51.974 --> 26:53.840
can trigger a relapse
with an addict.

26:53.875 --> 26:56.810
Relapse, okay, so now you think
I'm gonna become a gambler again

26:56.845 --> 26:58.311
because we're having a child?

26:58.347 --> 26:59.813
That's how much faith
you have in me?

26:59.848 --> 27:03.717
No. No, Booth, that's
how much I love you.

27:09.057 --> 27:10.724
Look, it's late,
okay?

27:10.759 --> 27:12.092
Let's just go to bed.

27:12.127 --> 27:14.127
It's 4:00 a.m.,
you have to sleep for two.

27:27.634 --> 27:29.675
Oh, Ms. Warren.

27:29.676 --> 27:31.485
I thought I'd be the first
one in this morning.

27:31.486 --> 27:33.486
Oh, you are-- I didn't
leave last night.

27:33.521 --> 27:35.321
I just had a vibe there'd
be something hidden

27:35.357 --> 27:36.789
in all this
shredding.

27:36.825 --> 27:38.691
Was your vibe at least right?
Totally.

27:38.727 --> 27:40.894
I found grooved
perimortem abrasions

27:40.929 --> 27:43.296
to the victim's right
scapula and humerus.

27:43.331 --> 27:45.865
They don't match the
teeth of the shredder.

27:45.901 --> 27:46.833
So he was stabbed?

27:46.868 --> 27:48.868
Sliced, it seems.

27:48.904 --> 27:50.637
So the victim was bashed
in the head,

27:50.672 --> 27:53.172
had his ribs stomped on, and now this.
The injuries are deep,

27:53.208 --> 27:55.675
so Curly might be able to
dig out some particulates

27:55.710 --> 27:58.077
that could ID the
weapon that cut him.

27:59.714 --> 28:01.915
So Angela downloaded
the footage

28:01.950 --> 28:03.716
from the game's
security system.

28:03.752 --> 28:06.386
This is the big hand Jeff Dover
won the night he was murdered.

28:06.421 --> 28:08.621
Ooh, 28 grand,
that has got to feel good.

28:08.657 --> 28:10.356
Yeah, till he was beaten
to death for it.

28:10.392 --> 28:12.558
But at least we know
who all was there that night.

28:12.594 --> 28:14.560
Except for the guy
with the beard,

28:14.596 --> 28:16.996
everyone else I play with.
<i>Played</i> with, okay?

28:17.032 --> 28:19.332
There is no reason for
you to go back there.

28:19.367 --> 28:22.068
We got everyone's name,
we're checking them out.

28:22.103 --> 28:24.437
So just, you know, give
it some time, Booth.

28:26.508 --> 28:27.640
Okay.

28:28.944 --> 28:30.410
All right, look,

28:30.445 --> 28:32.445
I know that this
is difficult, okay?

28:32.480 --> 28:35.315
You think the feelings
are gone, but they come back.

28:35.350 --> 28:37.350
What, are you
my sponsor now?

28:37.385 --> 28:40.286
No, I'm just some guy who'd take
a bullet for you in the field.

28:40.322 --> 28:43.222
The same way you'd
take one for me.

28:43.258 --> 28:45.591
And I know there's no talking
with your wife about this,

28:45.627 --> 28:47.160
because she'd
get too worried.

28:47.195 --> 28:48.361
Look, she's
already worried.

28:50.198 --> 28:52.131
Right? You know,
I get the feeling.

28:52.167 --> 28:53.766
I know that feeling,
that draw.

28:53.802 --> 28:55.802
But I'm good now,
right? Why?

28:55.837 --> 28:57.904
Because I'm strong,
that's why, okay?

28:57.939 --> 29:00.873
Okay, but I know
what it's like.

29:00.909 --> 29:02.942
For my father, it was
the stock market.

29:02.978 --> 29:06.112
He couldn't stop, even
after he lost everything.

29:06.147 --> 29:08.281
That's when he started
the Ponzi scheme.

29:08.316 --> 29:10.116
He had to win.

29:10.151 --> 29:12.018
And I always thought

29:12.053 --> 29:15.521
me and my mom should have been
enough for him, you know?

29:15.557 --> 29:18.091
It was never you,
all right?

29:18.126 --> 29:22.028
It's never the fault of the
people that are close to you.

29:23.198 --> 29:24.998
It was him.

29:26.134 --> 29:28.201
It's me.

29:32.273 --> 29:34.313
Well, if you ever can't get
ahold of your sponsor...

29:34.342 --> 29:36.609
Thanks, Aubrey,
I appreciate that.

29:37.846 --> 29:40.747
Right, I got some
background checks to run

29:40.782 --> 29:42.348
and a turkey
club to eat.

29:42.384 --> 29:44.283
Okay.

29:48.890 --> 29:50.857
SAROYAN:
Is this case- or beaker-related?

29:50.892 --> 29:53.326
Case, but the elastomer
that I copolymerized

29:53.361 --> 29:55.328
to undergo much more
elastic deformation...

29:55.363 --> 29:57.096
I've actually
been up all night,

29:57.132 --> 29:59.032
so if you can focus
before I keel over?

29:59.067 --> 30:01.567
Thank you, I thought I was gonna
have to move this along.

30:01.603 --> 30:03.636
Right, whatever stabbed Dover
was loaded with goodies.

30:03.671 --> 30:06.339
Now, I found <i> Tiliacora triandra,</i>

30:06.374 --> 30:08.908
leaves used
in kaeng nor Mai som.

30:08.943 --> 30:11.377
Thai food.
Yeah, wow, very good.

30:11.413 --> 30:13.346
Well, we had a Thai family
in the cooperative.

30:13.381 --> 30:15.381
Ooh, Thai coffee would
be good about now.

30:15.417 --> 30:16.983
Since I also
found traces

30:17.018 --> 30:20.219
of fish sauce and coconut milk,
as well as the palm oil,

30:20.255 --> 30:23.389
I decided to check out
Thai restaurants in the area.

30:23.425 --> 30:24.791
WARREN:
Chan Yim Thai.

30:24.826 --> 30:26.226
SAROYAN:
That's only a couple blocks

30:26.261 --> 30:27.527
away from the game.

30:27.562 --> 30:29.282
That might be where
Jeff Dover was murdered.

30:29.297 --> 30:31.431
And the metal that was
left in the wound,

30:31.466 --> 30:33.433
it wasn't from a knife, it was
aluminum from a trash can.

30:33.468 --> 30:35.368
I mean, there was probably
one in the alley

30:35.403 --> 30:38.071
that was filled with
the restaurant's refuse.

30:38.106 --> 30:39.772
So the can was torn,

30:39.808 --> 30:41.774
and when he went down,
the metal sliced into him.

30:41.810 --> 30:43.643
We should get out
into that alley

30:43.678 --> 30:45.044
and see if we can
find anything else.

30:45.080 --> 30:46.479
Uh...

30:46.514 --> 30:48.214
shouldn't the FBI techs
just sweep the place?

30:48.249 --> 30:49.449
Nah, no time--
this way

30:49.484 --> 30:51.004
we avoid the middleman,
right? Come on.

30:55.924 --> 30:58.124
Hodgins, Cam and Ms. Warren
are at the alley now.

30:58.159 --> 31:00.927
They found blood
near a pierced garbage can.

31:00.962 --> 31:02.595
So that's the
murder site?

31:02.630 --> 31:05.631
Well, we'll know more
when Cam tests the blood.

31:05.667 --> 31:07.133
What is that?

31:07.168 --> 31:08.501
Uh, prenatal vitamin.

31:08.536 --> 31:10.870
Right, right, now that
you're, uh, you know.

31:10.905 --> 31:12.205
Gestating.
Gestating.

31:12.240 --> 31:14.207
"Gestating," you
really are a poet.

31:14.242 --> 31:15.875
Any... oh,
anyway, look.

31:15.910 --> 31:17.844
I remember the cravings,
so just let me know

31:17.879 --> 31:19.846
if I should pick anything
up for you, right?

31:19.881 --> 31:22.715
Spaghetti, ice cream,
pickles, the hummus.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.550
That all sounds
good, actually.

31:24.586 --> 31:27.420
What did Aubrey find out
about the players in the game?

31:27.455 --> 31:29.088
Well, one guy we
didn't see before,

31:29.124 --> 31:30.523
but he's got an
ironclad alibi.

31:30.558 --> 31:32.125
The others are, you
know, nothing special.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.960
They're just guys who
like to play cards.

31:33.995 --> 31:35.695
That's all, all right?

31:35.730 --> 31:37.130
One coaches a high
school baseball team.

31:37.165 --> 31:38.564
Another one
builds houses

31:38.600 --> 31:40.133
for Habitat for
Humanity on weekends.

31:40.168 --> 31:42.435
Do any of them have,
uh, money trouble?

31:42.470 --> 31:44.237
No, Aubrey's trying
to find out,

31:44.272 --> 31:46.806
but we can't get a warrant
because we have no cause,

31:46.841 --> 31:48.128
and they're just gonna
say that we're fishing.

31:48.152 --> 31:49.443
Well, you would be.

31:49.444 --> 31:51.577
Well, it's a frustrating
thing right now.

31:55.283 --> 31:56.749
The composition
of the metal I found

31:56.784 --> 31:58.284
in the wound
matches the can.

31:58.319 --> 31:59.752
And the blood type's
a match for the victim.

31:59.787 --> 32:01.754
I can run DNA
back at the lab.

32:01.789 --> 32:03.089
You know, I thought
that the splinters

32:03.124 --> 32:04.157
in this tissue
were bone

32:04.192 --> 32:06.192
but they're
too porous.

32:06.227 --> 32:07.427
Yeah, no,
that seems like wood.

32:07.462 --> 32:08.995
Okay.

32:10.165 --> 32:12.899
This tissue is muscle
and cartilage

32:12.934 --> 32:15.268
from his esophagus
and throat.

32:15.303 --> 32:17.270
It's fibromuscular
tubing.

32:17.305 --> 32:19.238
So, after
a drawn-out fight,

32:19.274 --> 32:21.240
the killer jammed something wood
in the victim's neck

32:21.276 --> 32:22.876
and then ripped out pieces
of his throat?

32:22.911 --> 32:24.544
Gruesome, but we
found cause of death.

32:24.579 --> 32:27.180
Now we have to look
at all the wood back here

32:27.215 --> 32:29.335
to see if we can find the piece
he used to kill Dover.

32:34.189 --> 32:36.355
You don't have to go back
to the game, Booth.

32:36.391 --> 32:38.391
Cam and the others found
evidence at the scene.

32:38.426 --> 32:39.659
But we got no answers.

32:39.694 --> 32:40.793
Yet, but we will.

32:40.828 --> 32:41.861
What if the killer
finds out

32:41.896 --> 32:43.296
that we got a team,
you know,

32:43.331 --> 32:44.497
like, poking around
the murder scene, right?

32:44.532 --> 32:46.232
Just give us
some time, Booth.

32:46.267 --> 32:48.701
If the guy takes off, we might
not ever find him, ask Aubrey.

32:48.736 --> 32:50.303
Right?
Yeah, but what are you gonna do?

32:50.338 --> 32:52.171
Go in there and ask the killer
to raise his hand?

32:52.207 --> 32:53.673
Guys, I know
these guys, okay?

32:53.708 --> 32:55.074
I've been playing with them--
I know their tells,

32:55.109 --> 32:56.709
all right? I'll just
bring up the murder.

32:56.845 --> 32:58.645
What?
Yeah, they're not gonna cop to it, okay?

32:58.647 --> 33:00.313
But I'll know exactly
who's withholding.

33:00.348 --> 33:01.614
Then you can focus on the guy.

33:01.650 --> 33:02.615
We get the evidence you need.

33:02.651 --> 33:03.651
And I make the arrest.

33:03.652 --> 33:05.018
Okay, but as soon as you

33:05.053 --> 33:07.120
make the guy, you're
out of there, right?

33:07.155 --> 33:08.855
Yeah.

33:08.890 --> 33:10.323
Yeah, you just hesitated
a little bit there, Booth.

33:10.358 --> 33:11.791
What would make you stay?

33:11.827 --> 33:13.860
Nothing, okay?
I get the guy and I'm out.

33:13.895 --> 33:16.863
And if we find enough evidence
for an arrest first,

33:16.898 --> 33:18.465
we'll text you,
maybe you don't even

33:18.500 --> 33:19.666
have to start playing at all!

33:19.701 --> 33:20.733
Right. Okay!

33:20.769 --> 33:21.801
Wish me luck, all right?

33:21.837 --> 33:23.336
I got this.

33:30.306 --> 33:33.941
High-card for the button.

33:35.385 --> 33:36.479
Blinds, please.

33:36.480 --> 33:39.448
25, 50.

33:50.931 --> 33:51.860
BRENNAN:
<i>If the victim's</i>

33:51.896 --> 33:53.428
throat was torn out,

33:53.464 --> 33:55.164
we should see evidence of that

33:55.199 --> 33:58.534
on the hyoid and the clavicle.

34:09.079 --> 34:12.447
$2,000.

34:12.483 --> 34:14.349
Call.

34:27.063 --> 34:30.498
Seems like everyone's financials
are all over the place.

34:30.534 --> 34:32.400
Not strange for a bunch
of gamblers.

34:32.436 --> 34:35.103
I thought we couldn't get a
warrant for their financials.

34:35.139 --> 34:36.672
Well, we couldn't, but

34:36.706 --> 34:38.206
lucky for us, the Internet
doesn't require one.

34:38.242 --> 34:40.141
You just have
to know where to look.

34:40.177 --> 34:43.679
I'm for whatever will get Booth
out of there faster.

35:12.910 --> 35:15.877

35:25.689 --> 35:27.089
I don't know if word got
down to you guys yet,

35:27.124 --> 35:28.156
but Booth is winning big.

35:28.192 --> 35:29.691
Has he mentioned the murder yet?

35:29.727 --> 35:31.226
I don't think so.

35:31.262 --> 35:32.694
He's been there long enough,
hasn't he?

35:32.730 --> 35:33.662
Booth knows what he's doing,

35:33.697 --> 35:34.697
Ms. Warren.

35:34.732 --> 35:36.298
Here are some more particulates

35:36.333 --> 35:39.101
we found on the hyoid, Dr. Hodgins.
More wood splinters.

35:39.136 --> 35:40.869
All right, I'm running them
through the mass spec now.

35:40.904 --> 35:42.938
So far I've found nitrocellulose
and butyl acetate,

35:42.973 --> 35:44.573
which is making it tough
to determine what type of wood.

35:44.608 --> 35:45.907
Maybe these will help.

35:45.943 --> 35:48.110
I-I'd appreciate it
if you'd hurry.

35:48.145 --> 35:50.679
Like the wind, Dr. B.

35:54.485 --> 35:57.152
Nate Crowe,
the player also known

35:57.187 --> 36:00.455
as Mid-Life, had big-time
financial troubles this year.

36:00.491 --> 36:02.491
His account was drained
several times.

36:02.526 --> 36:05.527
But for the past month,
he's been totally broke.

36:05.562 --> 36:08.163
Booth said that he recently
went through a divorce.

36:08.198 --> 36:09.931
Turns out his house was
about to be foreclosed on,

36:09.967 --> 36:12.801
but then it was reversed after
a large deposit this morning.

36:12.836 --> 36:15.237
Nate Crowe killed Jeff Dover
for his poker winnings

36:15.272 --> 36:17.172
so he wouldn't lose his house.
Yes.

36:17.207 --> 36:20.375
But... we still need evidence.

36:33.791 --> 36:36.158
Action to Mid-Life.

36:36.193 --> 36:39.094
Let's bump it up to four.

36:39.129 --> 36:40.862
I'm out.

36:40.898 --> 36:42.297
Ah, what the hell?

36:42.333 --> 36:43.965
Call.

36:44.868 --> 36:46.535
Call.

36:47.571 --> 36:50.305
Action to Mid-Life.

36:52.109 --> 36:53.241
Let's make it

36:53.277 --> 36:54.876
two grand.

36:54.912 --> 36:56.278
Boom.

36:56.313 --> 36:57.512
Two grand, huh?

36:57.548 --> 36:59.147
You could always fold for free.

36:59.183 --> 37:01.183
Wow, there's a lot of action

37:01.218 --> 37:02.718
going on here tonight.

37:02.753 --> 37:05.120
Kind of like the other night
when Jeff Dover played.

37:05.155 --> 37:06.988
You guys hear what
happened to him?

37:07.024 --> 37:08.724
No, I just figured
he took a little break

37:08.759 --> 37:11.093
after that monster pot
he won earlier this week.

37:11.128 --> 37:12.627
Rumor has it, he was murdered.

37:12.663 --> 37:14.229
Get out of here. For real?
Yeah.

37:14.264 --> 37:16.431
For real. He was killed, uh,

37:16.467 --> 37:17.733
in the back alley right
around the corner there

37:17.768 --> 37:19.201
behind the Thai restaurant.

37:21.372 --> 37:23.939
Bet you cleaned him out more
than once, huh, Mid-Life?

37:23.974 --> 37:25.707
(laughs)
You know I did.

37:25.743 --> 37:27.042
(laughs):
Yeah.

37:27.077 --> 37:28.377
So, if he really is gone,

37:28.412 --> 37:29.611
I guess it's your turn, Newbie.

37:29.646 --> 37:30.746
You gonna call?

37:35.452 --> 37:38.153
"Maple wood"! Oh, my God!

37:38.188 --> 37:39.688
What? "Pine tar
and maple wood."

37:39.723 --> 37:41.656
Was he murdered with
a piece of furniture?

37:41.692 --> 37:43.959
No. It's a baseball bat.

37:48.165 --> 37:50.265
I'll call.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.068
Call.

38:01.445 --> 38:02.778
No more chasers.

38:02.813 --> 38:04.279
$6,000.
(men gasping)

38:11.422 --> 38:12.788
HODGINS:
Okay, that's it.

38:12.823 --> 38:15.090
So, he's holding
an Eastern Slammer.

38:15.125 --> 38:16.992
They're made out of maple wood.
Look at the pine tar.

38:17.027 --> 38:18.326
The blunt force trauma
to the temporal bone

38:18.362 --> 38:20.495
was caused by the bat.

38:20.531 --> 38:21.069
Yeah, which splintered.

38:21.070 --> 38:22.976
And that's what he used
to stab Dover in the throat.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.933
Yeah, so he could
keep his house.

38:24.968 --> 38:26.134
I should be able to grab

38:26.170 --> 38:28.103
some epithelial cells
from the pine tar.

38:28.138 --> 38:29.571
That's the proof we need!

38:31.175 --> 38:33.275
Six. My favorite number.

38:33.310 --> 38:35.410
I'll call.

38:36.680 --> 38:38.180
I'm out.

38:38.215 --> 38:39.614

38:42.886 --> 38:45.687
Mid-Life, you're...

39:02.072 --> 39:04.005
I don't understand.
He just read your text.

39:04.041 --> 39:06.875
Well, he might have too good
a hand-- it looks like there's

39:06.910 --> 39:08.743
20 grand in the pot so far.

39:08.779 --> 39:11.046
So what?
He's there to catch a murderer.

39:11.081 --> 39:13.048
He's an addict.

39:15.252 --> 39:17.419
I'm all in.

39:22.693 --> 39:24.693
