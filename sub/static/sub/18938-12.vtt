Sheila, I need to be
honest with you,

your board is disturbing me.

02:01.588 --> 02:03.797
Did you mean to black out
all of the eyes?

forwards.

backwards place.

02:18.213 --> 02:20.380

10:15.255 --> 10:18.588
- Yes. And, uh, you know,
I have to compliment you--

10:18.588 --> 10:22.047
- Meghan will sign that for you.

10:22.047 --> 10:23.797
- Right. Okay.

10:29.130 --> 10:31.338
(Phone rings)

10:32.755 --> 10:34.213
- Jesus.
- Jenny.

10:35.297 --> 10:37.880
- This is actually genius.
- I know.

10:37.880 --> 10:40.880
- They really do last longer.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.130
- Uh, duh, are you wearing
a wire or something?

10:43.130 --> 10:45.547
This is like the most obvious
conversation I've ever had.

10:45.547 --> 10:47.963
- Have you been avoiding me?

10:49.922 --> 10:53.588
Look, the other night,
that wasn't me.

10:53.588 --> 10:56.255
- Babes, you can play house

10:56.255 --> 10:59.380
and tell your mom squad
whatever you want,

10:59.380 --> 11:01.797
but I know you,
and as rude as you were,

11:01.797 --> 11:03.838
it was kinda nice to see you
finally accepting

11:03.838 --> 11:05.630
this whole separation thing.

11:05.630 --> 11:07.297
- Separation?
- Yeah.

11:07.297 --> 11:08.797
I've banged enough dudes
in that camp

11:08.797 --> 11:10.463
to know how messy it gets.

11:10.463 --> 11:12.588
- We're not going through
a separation.

11:12.588 --> 11:15.922
That night was just
a weird moment.

11:15.922 --> 11:17.630
And you, of all people,

11:17.630 --> 11:20.463
should get what it feels like
to wanna just fool around

11:20.463 --> 11:22.213
and not be yourself
for a second.

11:22.213 --> 11:24.422
- (Laughs) Okay.
Okay, look...

11:24.422 --> 11:27.630
I think I've been very patient,
through this petulant phase,

11:27.630 --> 11:29.838
but enough.

11:29.838 --> 11:32.047
You can try on as many dicks
as you want,

11:32.047 --> 11:34.130
and call it an identity crisis,

11:34.130 --> 11:37.463
but don't throw shade on me.
I know who I am.

11:37.463 --> 11:39.505
- And do your damn job, Jenny!

11:39.505 --> 11:41.755
Some of us are sick
of covering for you.

11:41.755 --> 11:43.380
- And stop eating food
from the fridge

11:43.380 --> 11:45.797
that has clearly been labeled
as another's!

11:45.797 --> 11:47.463
- I don't know what you're
talking about, Arden.

11:47.463 --> 11:49.172
- Oh, really?

11:49.172 --> 11:51.922
Pretty sure three quarters of
a calzone doesn't eat itself.

11:51.922 --> 11:54.297
- You could have at least
thrown out the box.

11:56.255 --> 11:58.255
- And that is the exact
kind of responsibility

11:58.255 --> 12:00.213
Westwood Foods wants
to be known for.

12:00.213 --> 12:02.505
Being the leader
in premium packaged meats

12:02.505 --> 12:04.963
in more than 20 worldwide
markets.

12:04.963 --> 12:07.547
Bringing great tasting,
quality and innovative food

12:07.547 --> 12:11.088
to Canada and beyond.
(Boardroom applauds)

12:12.130 --> 12:13.422
Thanks, guys.

12:13.422 --> 12:15.963
Victoria: So, uh...
What will you be wearing?

12:15.963 --> 12:18.213
- Uh, excuse me?
- To the meeting.

12:18.213 --> 12:21.922
- Oh, something appropriate.
- Appropriate?

12:21.922 --> 12:24.005
- Uh, black or navy pant suit.

12:24.005 --> 12:26.005
You don't have to worry.
I'll keep it professional.

12:26.005 --> 12:30.463
- Hm, would you allow me
to arrange something for you?

12:31.880 --> 12:34.672
- Uh, you wanna dress me?
(Laughs)

12:34.672 --> 12:36.880
- Yeah, we were hoping that you
would wear something

12:36.880 --> 12:38.880
a little bit more festive?

12:38.880 --> 12:40.422
- Oh, you're-you're being
serious.

12:40.422 --> 12:42.713
Uh... so like, um--

12:42.713 --> 12:45.297
- Piera will provide you
with what you need, huh.

12:45.297 --> 12:47.672
(Chuckles) à demain.

12:54.838 --> 12:57.797
- So, outfit aside,
did I just bomb?

12:57.797 --> 12:59.505
- Not at all.
She was really impressed.

12:59.505 --> 13:01.797
- For sure.
I think I even saw her smile.

13:01.797 --> 13:03.213
- Okay, good.

13:03.213 --> 13:04.963
So do you guys wanna grab
a drink?

13:04.963 --> 13:06.672
I mean, this is the least
amount of responsibility

13:06.672 --> 13:08.213
I've had since I was a teenager.

13:08.213 --> 13:10.547
- Thanks, but I try to be home
for bedtime.

13:10.547 --> 13:12.547
- Sure.

13:12.547 --> 13:14.713
- Yeah, it's taco night
at my house.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.088
Woman: I'm free.
- Shirley!

13:21.130 --> 13:23.088
Yeah, all right.
Shirley and I on the town.

13:23.088 --> 13:26.088
- Cool! Okay, so I just have
to take my antibiotic

13:26.088 --> 13:27.880
and then I'm good to go.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.338
Meet me in the lobby.
Don't be late.

13:32.338 --> 13:34.130
- Yeah, all right.

14:22.547 --> 14:24.672
A guy wrote me last week:

14:24.672 --> 14:27.713
he told me my teeth
were the perfect shape

14:27.713 --> 14:30.297
and size for intimacy.
- Mmm.

14:31.297 --> 14:33.797

- Super creepy.

14:33.797 --> 14:35.838
- Yeah. But it's also cool

14:35.838 --> 14:38.255
because you have so many
options. Right?

14:38.255 --> 14:42.380
Like, I have thousands of guys
at my finger tips at all times.

14:42.380 --> 14:44.005
On the other hand,

14:44.005 --> 14:46.672
they have thousands of women
at their finger tips.

14:46.672 --> 14:48.838
So you start to feel like
everyone's just like,

14:48.838 --> 14:50.380
who's next? It's like iTunes:

14:50.380 --> 14:52.463
nobody wants to listen
to the whole song.

14:52.463 --> 14:55.755
You start to feel like you're
just like half the song.

14:55.755 --> 14:58.213
- (Soft) Oh no,
you're a whole song.

14:58.213 --> 14:59.963
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

14:59.963 --> 15:01.297
- Thanks.

15:01.297 --> 15:03.755
- And look, I mean,
thousands of guys,

15:03.755 --> 15:07.672
one of them is bound to be
the... one... of them?

15:07.672 --> 15:10.547
- Kate. I went to
the chiropractor once

15:10.547 --> 15:13.630
just for the human touch.
- That's resourceful.

15:13.630 --> 15:15.213
- I guess.

15:15.213 --> 15:17.713
It was really expensive.

15:19.922 --> 15:23.130
- So, um, how about this
Victoria Stromanger?

15:23.130 --> 15:24.672
I mean, I'm dying.

15:24.672 --> 15:27.297
You gotta be learning so much
from working next to her.

15:27.297 --> 15:29.588
- I guess. I kind of try
to avoid her.

15:29.588 --> 15:32.713
Do you wanna split a smoke meat
poutine? They're really good.

15:32.713 --> 15:35.797
- Yeah, all right.
- Excuse me!

15:35.797 --> 15:39.922
Hi. Um, could we get a smoke
meat poutine?

15:39.922 --> 15:41.963
I'd like to split it,

15:41.963 --> 15:43.922
um... so could you bring
two separate plates?

15:43.922 --> 15:46.297
But bring like two separate
plates, don't just bring

15:46.297 --> 15:48.755
the plate with the poutine
and then a separate plate.

15:51.547 --> 15:53.297

Nathan: Oh, it doesn't
look that bad.

16:19.047 --> 16:20.922
- Not that bad?

16:20.922 --> 16:23.880
It is dusty rose. It's what
great aunts everywhere

16:23.880 --> 16:26.297
wear to baby showers.
It's wool, by the way.

16:26.297 --> 16:28.005
In case you were wondering
about the ventilation,

16:28.005 --> 16:30.463
not so great.
- I kind of like it on you.

16:30.463 --> 16:32.088
- You do?

16:32.088 --> 16:34.505
Does this make up for this
morning's conversation?

16:34.505 --> 16:38.172
Your wife looking like
a 1990's Hillary Clinton?

16:38.172 --> 16:40.005
- Now you're tapping into some
deep seeded

16:40.005 --> 16:43.255
childhood fantasies of mine.
- Care to elaborate?

16:43.255 --> 16:45.922
- It's me and Hillary Rodham
at a carnival.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.422
Nothing dirty.
Just some ring toss.

16:48.422 --> 16:50.297
She's very competitive.

16:50.297 --> 16:52.380
- I miss you, boys.

16:52.380 --> 16:55.922
(Charlie cries)
- Oh, it's okay, baby.

16:55.922 --> 16:58.797
Oh God, momma's here.

16:58.797 --> 17:00.922
This is not even fair for him.

17:00.922 --> 17:04.047
FaceTime for a baby?
It's like a cruel trick.

17:04.047 --> 17:05.505
- He understands, honey.
It's okay.

17:05.505 --> 17:08.588
It's okay, Charlie.
It's okay, buddy.

17:08.588 --> 17:10.838
It's okay.
- This is awful.

17:10.838 --> 17:12.630
- I'm sorry. We gotta go, honey.

17:12.630 --> 17:15.213
- Yeah, no, of course.
Let's try again in the morn--

17:15.213 --> 17:17.255
Nathan?

17:25.047 --> 17:27.005
Giselle: Have you moved today?

17:27.005 --> 17:28.380
- I'm working.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.880
- You guys have a good day?

17:29.880 --> 17:33.463
- I dunno. Would you qualify
making $600,000 a good day?

17:33.463 --> 17:36.213
- Right?
Did you sell our baby?

17:36.213 --> 17:39.963
- What?! No.
I would never do that.

17:39.963 --> 17:42.880
I sold our house.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.338
- Excuse me?

17:45.338 --> 17:47.297
You-you what?

17:48.338 --> 17:49.963
- You should be thrilled.

17:49.963 --> 17:51.963
I've actually had it on
the market for a while now,

17:51.963 --> 17:54.047
you know, just to stay
in touch with its value

17:54.047 --> 17:56.005
and this couple made an offer
a while back

17:56.005 --> 17:58.672
which I totally ignored,
but then I got to thinking,

17:58.672 --> 18:00.422
it's just... stuff.

18:00.422 --> 18:03.338
- How could you do that without
considering me or Rhoda?

18:03.338 --> 18:05.172
- It's just stuff, Giselle!
All of it.

18:05.172 --> 18:07.130
Just a bunch of nonsense
that we don't even really need.

18:07.130 --> 18:09.213
And we clean and we service
and we clean and...

18:09.213 --> 18:11.297
then I was thinking
about all the stuff

18:11.297 --> 18:13.005
you've been shackled with
while I'm at work?

18:13.005 --> 18:14.338
It's unsustainable.

18:14.338 --> 18:16.713
- But where are we
going to live?!

18:23.588 --> 18:26.672
You know, Frankie,
when people ask me

18:27.755 --> 18:30.213
how I could stay married to you,

18:30.213 --> 18:32.338
you know what I say?

18:32.338 --> 18:35.463
I say it's like being
deep in the ocean.

18:37.838 --> 18:40.630

18:43.130 --> 18:45.588

18:45.588 --> 18:48.422

18:48.422 --> 18:51.547

18:52.630 --> 18:54.547
No!

No, I-I did this for us!
