00:00.230 --> 00:01.830
Previously on the Fosters.

00:01.830 --> 00:03.200
Hey, who's there?

00:03.469 --> 00:04.090
Go.

00:05.590 --> 00:07.760
When are things gonna stop being weird between us?

00:07.760 --> 00:09.930
I'm straight. I was married.

00:09.930 --> 00:12.710
I cheated on my boyfriend, and I lost my virginity

00:12.710 --> 00:14.560
to a random boy I barely know.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.510
I'm pretty sure that makes me a slut.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.250
Hi, it's A.J. I got arrested.

00:18.250 --> 00:19.860
- For huffing. -Tagging.

00:19.890 --> 00:21.840
- What is it? - It's a bat signal.

00:22.280 --> 00:23.830
I just wanted Ty to know where I was.

00:23.830 --> 00:25.360
- Ty? - That's my brother.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.380
Just something about him. He's a good kid.

00:27.380 --> 00:28.790
Are you thinking about fostering him?

00:28.790 --> 00:30.980
I was thinking about you fostering him.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

00:42.820 --> 00:44.180
So, Callie, we were thinking

00:44.180 --> 00:47.020
that maybe A.J. could hang out with you during the day--

00:47.020 --> 00:49.400
You know, go to class and the drop-in center.

00:49.890 --> 00:51.780
And then, A.J., once we get your transcripts,

00:51.780 --> 00:53.000
we can see what credits you still need,

00:53.000 --> 00:55.140
and then we can get you enrolled in summer school.

00:55.140 --> 00:56.400
- Sound good? - Yes, ma'am.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.410
And you don't have to call me ma'am. Lena's fine.

00:59.410 --> 01:01.350
Yeah, and I can pick you up in the afternoons,

01:01.350 --> 01:02.650
you know, after work,

01:02.970 --> 01:04.870
and we can hang a little, till I get my foster license.

01:04.879 --> 01:06.090
How long will that take?

01:07.260 --> 01:09.230
Uh, hopefully not too long.

01:10.060 --> 01:11.830
Until then, we want you to feel at home.

01:11.940 --> 01:13.150
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

01:13.150 --> 01:16.250
I really appreciate it. By the way, this is delicious.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.760
- Aww, thank you. - He can sleep in my room.

01:18.760 --> 01:20.710
My brother's at boarding school, so there's an extra bed.

01:20.710 --> 01:23.120
- You don't mind? - It's cool. We all share.

01:23.120 --> 01:25.740
Except Brandon. He has his own room.

01:25.950 --> 01:26.920
Is that your son?

01:27.770 --> 01:29.590
Uh, yeah, mine and Stef's.

01:29.740 --> 01:30.880
Oh, and Lena's.

01:30.890 --> 01:33.530
I mean, he's all of ours, really.

01:36.190 --> 01:38.700
So I got a job.

01:39.340 --> 01:40.320
A job?

01:40.320 --> 01:42.050
Well, you don't have to seem so shocked.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.400
Victor offered. At the bakery.

01:44.770 --> 01:46.470
- Hey. There he is. - Hey, babe.

01:46.470 --> 01:48.030
- You hungry? - Hey, dad.

01:48.630 --> 01:49.580
Let me get you a chair.

01:51.460 --> 01:53.180
- Who's this? - A.J., this is Brandon.

01:53.190 --> 01:54.300
Brandon, this is A.J.

01:54.300 --> 01:56.080
A.J.'s gonna be staying with us for a little while.

01:56.700 --> 02:00.260
- He's a foster kid. - Oh, we're fostering another kid?

02:00.270 --> 02:02.340
Oh, we're not. Mike is.

02:46.430 --> 02:48.150
Callie met A.J. at the drop-in center.

02:48.150 --> 02:50.560
And he needed a new foster home,

02:50.570 --> 02:52.330
so I thought of your dad.

02:53.420 --> 02:54.080
Why?

02:54.850 --> 02:56.180
- Thanks, B. - No, I just...

02:56.180 --> 02:59.250
It's not like you've ever talked about being a foster parent.

02:59.770 --> 03:01.380
No, but, I mean, I've thought about it.

03:01.530 --> 03:03.770
You know, seeing how your moms did

03:03.770 --> 03:06.140
with Callie and Jude and the twins and--

03:06.840 --> 03:09.130
Look, I went to visit A.J.--

03:09.640 --> 03:11.430
Visit him? Where?

03:11.940 --> 03:12.860
In juvie.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.120
Juvie? He was in juvie?

03:15.120 --> 03:16.900
Callie was in juvie when she came here.

03:17.180 --> 03:19.660
- It was for a minor offense. - He's a good kid, B.

03:19.660 --> 03:21.210
He's just had some tough breaks,

03:21.210 --> 03:23.030
and maybe I can make a difference in his life.

03:23.030 --> 03:24.590
And I'd like your support.

03:25.540 --> 03:26.420
Yeah, yeah,

03:26.420 --> 03:28.820
I mean, if that's what you want to do.

03:30.460 --> 03:31.790
I gotta get to work.

03:31.790 --> 03:33.810
Look, we're having dinner tomorrow night, right?

03:34.700 --> 03:35.460
Right.

03:37.490 --> 03:38.200
'Night.

03:39.460 --> 03:40.720
You think he's gonna be okay?

03:41.710 --> 03:43.880
I think he needs some time to let it sink in.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.010
He was great with the other kids.

03:46.890 --> 03:48.520
Well, I'm gonna get going.

03:49.570 --> 03:50.450
Thanks for dinner.

03:52.130 --> 03:52.800
And, hey,

03:53.670 --> 03:55.330
thanks for thinking of me, with A.J.,

03:56.120 --> 03:58.180
and giving him a home till I can.

03:59.270 --> 04:00.070
It means a lot.

04:00.610 --> 04:01.490
No worries.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.410
Have a good night, Mike.

04:07.390 --> 04:08.120
What?

04:09.300 --> 04:11.510
If, for any reason, Mike doesn't follow through--

04:11.510 --> 04:12.790
I know, I know.

04:12.790 --> 04:15.220
And what is Jesus doesn't like boarding school?

04:15.220 --> 04:16.820
We are not replacing Jesus

04:16.820 --> 04:19.310
and we are not fostering another kid, okay?

04:20.920 --> 04:21.550
Come here.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.430
Dinner was quite delicious.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.400
Thank you.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.520
You're welcome.

04:27.270 --> 04:29.430
I was having deja vu all through dinner

04:29.430 --> 04:31.940
about Callie's first night with us.

04:32.390 --> 04:34.110
When she asked if we were dykes?

04:38.410 --> 04:40.650
In comparison, A.J. seems like a dream.

04:44.780 --> 04:46.510
Oh my gosh, I almost forgot.

04:46.510 --> 04:47.200
What?

04:48.100 --> 04:50.120
I'm meeting Jenna in, like, 20 minutes.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.210
Where are you going?

04:51.980 --> 04:54.010
Girls' night at the Laurel.

04:55.740 --> 04:58.430
Oh, I can't remember the last time I went there.

04:58.510 --> 04:59.810
I'm glad to hear that.

05:00.280 --> 05:02.240
Maybe if I tell her that we have a new foster kid.

05:02.240 --> 05:04.740
No, no, you can't cancel this late.

05:04.740 --> 05:06.170
No, I can cancel whenever I want to.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.820
No, just go.

05:07.820 --> 05:09.270
I have things under control here.

05:09.280 --> 05:10.410
I know you do.

05:10.610 --> 05:13.070
Who knows? Maybe you'll meet someone nice.

05:15.670 --> 05:16.520
Really.

05:20.650 --> 05:21.470
So you don't feel weird

05:21.470 --> 05:23.290
sharing your room with some kid you don't know?

05:23.370 --> 05:25.090
I've been in seven foster homes.

05:25.090 --> 05:27.580
I've shared a lot of rooms with a lot of kids I don't know.

05:27.830 --> 05:29.680
Oh, man. Sick!

05:34.420 --> 05:35.570
Oh, you're going down.

05:36.060 --> 05:37.670
Could you turn that down, please?

05:38.070 --> 05:39.860
Dude, no way. I'm dominating.

05:40.370 --> 05:42.770
Seriously, it hurts my ears.

05:42.950 --> 05:43.640
Fine.

05:45.090 --> 05:46.230
Whatever, granny.

06:21.330 --> 06:22.260
What are you doing?

06:24.950 --> 06:26.360
You shouldn't sneak up on people.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.990
You shouldn't be in here.

06:31.780 --> 06:33.680
So the real kid gets his own room, huh?

06:34.910 --> 06:36.480
Well, we're all real,

06:37.510 --> 06:38.710
and everyone had their own rooms

06:38.710 --> 06:40.590
before Jude and I came, so...

06:45.360 --> 06:47.580
Look, this "Yes, ma'am" act--

06:48.740 --> 06:51.040
I know you don't appreciate being here,

06:51.040 --> 06:52.390
and you just wanted to get out of juvie

06:52.390 --> 06:53.890
so that you could run again.

06:54.190 --> 06:56.060
Oh, so you can read minds now too?

06:56.590 --> 06:59.290
I got fired from the drop-in center because of you.

06:59.290 --> 07:01.560
If my moms knew about that, you wouldn't be here.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.040
So then why didn't you tell them?

07:03.040 --> 07:06.000
I was cool with Stef helping you with your charges.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.130
I didn't think that she was gonna...

07:07.140 --> 07:08.080
Bring me home,

07:10.490 --> 07:11.800
like some pound puppy?

07:15.080 --> 07:16.060
Look, if you don't want me here,

07:16.060 --> 07:17.580
why don't you go tell them right now?

07:19.120 --> 07:19.920
What's going on?

07:23.490 --> 07:25.570
I was just showing A.J. around.

07:27.890 --> 07:29.050
The tour's over.

07:30.430 --> 07:31.440
- 'night. - 'night.

07:32.470 --> 07:34.740
- It's a nice crib. - Glad you like it.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.750
God, why did everybody get so young?

07:43.770 --> 07:45.700
Oh, they didn't. We got old.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.410
Oh, hey. What about her?

07:48.800 --> 07:51.590
- What, the one with the short hair? - Uh-huh, yeah.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.410
She could be your daughter, Jenna.

07:53.410 --> 07:55.510
How dare you? You...

07:55.710 --> 07:58.020
You can't date women who--

07:58.030 --> 08:01.070
who've watched "Friends" for the first time on Netflix, come on.

08:01.070 --> 08:03.030
Unfortunately, those girls are my only option.

08:03.030 --> 08:04.270
I mean, let's face it,

08:04.270 --> 08:05.760
if they're my age and they're still single,

08:05.760 --> 08:07.610
then there's probably a reason.

08:07.710 --> 08:08.770
Jenna, I hate to tell you this,

08:08.770 --> 08:10.540
but you are your age and still single.

08:10.550 --> 08:13.330
Oh, wait a minute. Okay, don't look now,

08:13.330 --> 08:15.370
But there is a gorgeous,

08:15.370 --> 08:17.290
age-appropriate woman in the bar.

08:17.310 --> 08:19.320
No, don't look now.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.820
Just wait for it. Wait.

08:21.290 --> 08:22.360
Okay, wait, wait.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.530
Okay, now. Now.

08:26.910 --> 08:29.890
Which one? The redhead? The glasses?

08:29.890 --> 08:33.179
No, the brunette. The one in the middle of the bar, there.

08:34.080 --> 08:34.750
Right there.

08:39.100 --> 08:42.140
- Oh my god. I know her. - You know her?

08:42.549 --> 08:45.550
Yeah, she's... she's Lena's boss.

08:45.550 --> 08:46.640
Really?

08:46.640 --> 08:50.650
Well, then send me to the principal's office,

08:50.660 --> 08:52.310
'cause I've been a naughty girl.

08:52.850 --> 08:55.340
Settle down, Tiger. She's straight.

08:55.980 --> 08:57.240
What? How do you know?

08:57.350 --> 08:59.600
Because she was married to a man.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.100
You were married to a man.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.420
- So? - So what?

09:08.630 --> 09:11.560
Oh, nothing. Just our hot new foster brother.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.030
He's not our foster brother.

09:14.170 --> 09:16.660
Good point. So he's in play.

09:16.660 --> 09:19.340
- You have a boyfriend. - Not for me, for you.

09:19.390 --> 09:20.890
You haven't had a boyfriend since...

09:20.890 --> 09:22.620
Wyatt? Yeah, I know.

09:22.750 --> 09:24.910
I have more important things to think about.

09:24.920 --> 09:27.880
- Like what? - Like finding a new independent study.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.740
What happened to your old independent study?

09:31.370 --> 09:33.600
I got fired from the drop-in center.

09:33.910 --> 09:35.860
I don't want to talk about it. And no, moms don't know yet,

09:35.860 --> 09:37.590
and I don't want to tell them until I find another one,

09:37.590 --> 09:38.920
so please don't say anything.

09:39.250 --> 09:39.880
Okay.

09:41.780 --> 09:43.720
- Did you do something bad? - Mariana.

09:44.910 --> 09:45.680
Sorry.

09:48.610 --> 09:50.520
I'm sorry it's so small. It's the only one I could find

09:50.520 --> 09:52.780
that didn't have action figures all over it.

09:53.350 --> 09:54.080
It's cool.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.250
Oh, and Callie told me that you like to draw,

09:58.150 --> 10:01.220
so feel free to use any of the pencils here on Jesus's desk.

10:02.910 --> 10:04.240
Did he do something wrong?

10:04.550 --> 10:06.080
Is that why you guys sent him away?

10:06.690 --> 10:09.490
No, no. He's a wrestler.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.090
He got a scholarship. He wanted to go.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.460
So am I, like, the first black kid you fostered?

10:17.270 --> 10:17.950
Yes.

10:18.840 --> 10:19.870
Why do you ask?

10:19.870 --> 10:22.270
It's just not a lot of people want to take in a black boy,

10:22.270 --> 10:23.280
let alone two.

10:23.580 --> 10:25.370
That's why me and my brother got separated.

10:26.780 --> 10:30.190
Well, that is not true for us.

10:31.420 --> 10:33.190
We're really glad you're here, A.J.

10:37.450 --> 10:38.240
'Night, bubba.

10:41.210 --> 10:41.870
'Night.

10:43.220 --> 10:43.910
Good night.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.150
I grind my teeth sometimes at night.

10:51.920 --> 10:54.390
But, you know, just throw a pillow at me if it keeps you up.

10:54.530 --> 10:55.830
That's what Jesus always did.

10:55.940 --> 10:58.490
Okay. That's good to know.

11:10.610 --> 11:12.510
Are you sure I can't get you a coffee?

11:12.770 --> 11:14.130
Already three cups in.

11:14.130 --> 11:16.570
Any more caffeine, and I'm likely to get coffee gut.

11:16.900 --> 11:19.440
Well, looks like you got a lot of water damage up there.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.250
That pipe's probably been leaking for months.

11:21.250 --> 11:24.130
So we're told. So how soon can you get us a quote?

11:24.240 --> 11:26.290
I can email it to you, end of day.

11:26.660 --> 11:28.250
Should I send it to you or your husband?

11:28.250 --> 11:29.100
'morning.

11:29.650 --> 11:31.370
Stef, this is Carl.

11:31.640 --> 11:32.750
Hi, Carl. How is it going?

11:33.560 --> 11:35.620
So are you two sisters or...

11:36.000 --> 11:37.380
No, she's my wife.

11:39.220 --> 11:41.000
So you can just get that quote to me.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.370
- You've got my email. - Okay.

11:44.160 --> 11:44.900
Will do.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.640
Have a good day, Carl.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.630
Sisters? Seriously?

11:55.570 --> 11:57.250
How many of these quotes do we have to get?

11:57.250 --> 11:58.410
At least three.

11:58.920 --> 12:01.630
So how was your drinks with Jenna?

12:01.630 --> 12:04.250
Um, hmm, interesting.

12:04.980 --> 12:07.650
Yeah? Did you meet your future second wife?

12:07.650 --> 12:10.740
No, I didn't, but she seems to think she did.

12:10.740 --> 12:12.060
Really? She met someone?

12:12.060 --> 12:14.220
- Mm-hmm. - What's she like?

12:15.070 --> 12:17.420
Let's see. She's pretty,

12:17.810 --> 12:18.760
brunette,

12:18.760 --> 12:21.850
works as a principal at a charter school.

12:22.850 --> 12:24.810
Really? Here in San Diego? What's her name?

12:25.460 --> 12:26.470
Monte Porter.

12:28.950 --> 12:30.250
Did you know she was gay?

12:31.860 --> 12:33.380
She was... she was married to a man.

12:33.380 --> 12:36.160
I was married to a man, Lena.

12:36.780 --> 12:38.780
Just because she was at a gay bar doesn't mean...

12:38.780 --> 12:41.430
She was on a date with a woman that she met online.

12:41.730 --> 12:42.830
How do you know that?

12:43.040 --> 12:44.990
Because Jenna made me introduce her.

12:45.770 --> 12:48.370
Well, that must have been a little awkward.

12:48.690 --> 12:51.680
Well, it gets better. She wants you to set them up.

12:52.790 --> 12:53.630
Okay, well,

12:53.630 --> 12:56.990
I am not setting up my boss with one of our friends.

12:56.990 --> 12:57.560
Fine.

12:57.560 --> 12:59.220
- No. - You tell Jenna, then. 

12:59.220 --> 13:00.390
I'm not telling her.

13:01.620 --> 13:03.460
Oh, speak of the devil.

13:05.010 --> 13:06.560
Yeah, we were just talking about it.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.630
She is. She is. She's right here.

13:08.630 --> 13:12.120
Here, let me put you on video chat. There we go.

13:12.130 --> 13:13.480
Hi, Jenna.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.550
Hi, Lena.

13:14.770 --> 13:16.450
I am obsessed with your boss.

13:16.450 --> 13:17.640
You've got to set me up.

13:17.640 --> 13:19.840
How about you have us over for dinner?

13:19.870 --> 13:21.510
And that way it won't be so awkward.

13:22.030 --> 13:23.120
Jenna, I really don't think...

13:23.120 --> 13:24.130
Oh, please, come on.

13:24.130 --> 13:26.300
You have no idea how bleak it is out there.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.110
- So bleak. - Oh, and you gotta do it soon,

13:28.110 --> 13:29.960
before she has a second date with that loser from last night,

13:29.960 --> 13:32.250
because you know what lesbians brings on the second date.

13:32.250 --> 13:33.910
- A u-haul. - A u-haul, I know.

13:33.910 --> 13:36.080
- You know what? We're not doing anything tonight. - Tonight?

13:36.080 --> 13:38.250
Yes, tonight? Tonight? I can make tonight work.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.350
I will do all the shopping and cooking,

13:39.350 --> 13:41.100
so you won't even have to lift a finger.

13:41.470 --> 13:43.370
Okay, let me know what she says. I am so excited.

13:43.370 --> 13:45.880
Thank you. You are the best friend in the world.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.870
Hey. What's up?

13:58.140 --> 14:00.570
Sorry, mama asked if her phone was in here.

14:00.570 --> 14:02.300
Yeah, yeah, it's over on the bedside table.

14:08.950 --> 14:09.690
You okay?

14:11.810 --> 14:14.960
Weren't you scared of guns after you were shot?

14:15.740 --> 14:17.790
Yeah, I guess I was a little bit more nervous 

14:17.790 --> 14:20.350
carrying a firearm than I had been before.

14:21.790 --> 14:22.750
What did you do?

14:24.610 --> 14:25.950
Well, I went to the shooting range

14:25.950 --> 14:27.920
and practiced and practiced and practiced

14:27.920 --> 14:31.280
until I felt comfortable and confident again.

14:32.390 --> 14:34.010
I remember the sound the most.

14:34.270 --> 14:35.430
It was so loud.

14:37.550 --> 14:39.030
Yeah, I remember that too.

14:39.300 --> 14:40.610
I think I just...

14:42.110 --> 14:44.780
I don't understand how Connor can play those, 

14:45.140 --> 14:46.760
you know, shooter games.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.680
I mean, he was the one who was shot.

14:49.020 --> 14:50.890
Yeah, well, you were shot at.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.520
That's every bit as traumatic.

14:53.660 --> 14:54.750
And listen to me,

14:55.450 --> 14:58.180
It's not a bad thing to be afraid of guns.

14:58.180 --> 14:59.080
You hear me?

15:05.160 --> 15:06.360
Now take that to mama.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.110
Okay, I'm so happy you're here.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.490
I'm the only employee that's under 50.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.980
It's like an old folks' home.

15:15.980 --> 15:17.290
- Really? - Seriously.

15:17.290 --> 15:19.640
The last person who worked with me was my great-aunt Amelia.

15:19.690 --> 15:21.760
- and she was 92. - Is she...

15:21.760 --> 15:23.600
Retired. It was time.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.180
She was really gassy,

15:25.180 --> 15:27.120
and she couldn't hold it in anymore.

15:28.650 --> 15:30.550
Let's just say it wasn't good for business.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.010
Look at you two.

15:33.980 --> 15:36.470
I'm happy my beautiful granddaughters are getting along

15:36.470 --> 15:37.730
and getting to know each other.

15:37.730 --> 15:39.770
And Elena and I are looking forward

15:39.770 --> 15:42.520
to spending more time together with you, Mariana.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.400
Oh, thanks. Me too.

15:44.950 --> 15:46.020
Now back to work.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.740
Okay, so what do we do?

15:52.740 --> 15:55.540
You're looking at it. We stand here

15:55.540 --> 15:57.320
and wait for customers to come in.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.340
And we wait, and we wait.

16:08.930 --> 16:11.030
Business hasn't really been that great.

16:16.210 --> 16:17.710
Okay, so Mike will pick you up

16:17.710 --> 16:19.800
out here this afternoon.

16:20.090 --> 16:21.070
And if you need anything,

16:21.080 --> 16:22.920
you can always find me in my office, okay?

16:23.320 --> 16:24.110
Yes, ma'am.

16:24.710 --> 16:25.570
I mean, Lena.

16:32.670 --> 16:34.150
Okay, guys, have a good day.

16:35.410 --> 16:37.060
This is where you go to school?

16:37.060 --> 16:37.700
Yep.

16:38.660 --> 16:40.880
And there's, like, no gates or fences or anything?

16:41.530 --> 16:42.210
Nope.

16:42.820 --> 16:44.500
You're free to take off whenever you want.

16:51.580 --> 16:52.510
Good morning.

16:54.330 --> 16:55.110
Morning.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.240
- So I guess-- - Stef told--

16:57.710 --> 16:59.820
- Sorry, you go. - Sorry, you go.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.609
Look, I--

17:13.470 --> 17:17.619
It's been really hard to meet people,

17:17.880 --> 17:21.069
so I signed up for one of those dating sites.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.400
And when I was checking the boxes,

17:23.400 --> 17:24.560
I just thought...

17:26.300 --> 17:28.990
You know, it hasn't worked out great for me with men,

17:28.990 --> 17:32.760
so why not check all the boxes?

17:32.760 --> 17:34.180
I mean, not all the boxes.

17:34.180 --> 17:35.490
Some of them are weird.

17:35.770 --> 17:38.990
But the last thing I expected 

17:38.990 --> 17:40.780
on my first date ever with a woman

17:40.780 --> 17:42.630
was to run into your wife.

17:43.110 --> 17:45.300
- You don't have to explain. - No, I do.

17:45.300 --> 17:48.650
I-- I told you I was straight,

17:49.100 --> 17:53.810
and I don't even know if I'm bisexual or whatever.

17:53.810 --> 17:54.640
I just--

17:56.650 --> 17:58.120
I just thought I should keep an open mind,

17:58.120 --> 18:03.000
because, you know, I really would like to meet someone nice.

18:05.770 --> 18:08.030
Damn, this boy is hot.

18:08.030 --> 18:08.960
He's all right.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.910
And he's a rock star. You scored, girl.

18:13.590 --> 18:16.780
Aww, you miss him. That's so sweet.

18:17.150 --> 18:18.080
Who's Wyatt?

18:18.590 --> 18:19.440
No one.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.660
No one?

18:28.790 --> 18:30.700
Just a friend. So what do you do

18:30.700 --> 18:32.920
with all the extra bread and pastries at the end of the day?

18:32.920 --> 18:36.140
We give most of it to the homeless shelters or to food kitchens.

18:36.140 --> 18:37.970
They must love us.

18:38.380 --> 18:39.930
Abuelo Victor says that it's getting harder

18:39.930 --> 18:42.300
to compete with the grocery store bakeries.

18:42.300 --> 18:45.250
Well, makes sense. The only small bakeries or cafes I know

18:45.260 --> 18:48.320
all have some trendy little dessert that everyone wants to try,

18:48.320 --> 18:50.750
Like the "Pie-kie" or the "Cronut."

18:51.230 --> 18:53.050
What about the "Churronut"?

18:53.880 --> 18:55.530
A churro and a donut? 

18:55.990 --> 18:56.730
That's brilliant.

18:56.730 --> 18:59.540
I know, but Sbuelo shot it down.

18:59.540 --> 19:00.420
Why?

19:01.640 --> 19:02.720
"Trends come and go,

19:02.730 --> 19:05.330
"Pero la tradicion es para siempre."

19:05.670 --> 19:07.920
Well, I don't see any customers coming or going,

19:07.920 --> 19:11.610
so maybe we need to convince him to try some new tradiciones.

19:11.610 --> 19:12.440
How?

19:13.460 --> 19:15.220
Demand-side economics.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.530
Wait, what?

19:18.530 --> 19:19.730
I got this.

19:22.450 --> 19:23.740
I'm telling you, the new zombie mode

19:23.740 --> 19:25.560
is, like, supposed to be a gore-fest,

19:25.560 --> 19:27.820
like, there's body parts flying and just...

19:30.580 --> 19:32.270
You gotta come over tomorrow so we can play it.

19:33.110 --> 19:34.280
I can't come over tomorrow.

19:35.190 --> 19:36.550
Come on, what's up with you?

19:37.370 --> 19:39.350
Nothing. I just... have plans.

19:39.820 --> 19:40.970
What plans?

19:43.100 --> 19:44.440
I'm going to a shooting range.

19:45.210 --> 19:46.910
- Seriously? - With my mom.

19:47.380 --> 19:49.770
She's gonna teach me how to shoot a gun-- a real gun.

19:49.770 --> 19:52.670
I want to shoot a gun. Can I come?

19:54.140 --> 19:55.950
Well, I don't know.

19:55.950 --> 19:57.160
Would your dad even let you?

19:57.160 --> 19:59.090
He hunts. And your mom's a cop.

19:59.090 --> 20:01.390
There's, like, no one safer to go with.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.960
I mean, I'm sure he'd be cool with it.

20:03.310 --> 20:04.380
Can you ask?

20:04.940 --> 20:06.400
Come on, just ask.

20:07.850 --> 20:10.740
So I need to find a new independent study project,

20:10.740 --> 20:14.020
and I was thinking I could do a paper

20:14.020 --> 20:15.900
on the history of the foster care system,

20:15.900 --> 20:18.180
and why it was created as an alternative

20:18.180 --> 20:20.130
to orphanages in the United States.

20:20.130 --> 20:21.990
Well, if you can sell it to the administration...

20:21.990 --> 20:23.260
Great. Thank you so much.

20:23.260 --> 20:24.530
Oh, good.

21:01.850 --> 21:05.060
Sorry, I was just checking out the beach.

21:05.060 --> 21:06.220
Pretty crazy, right?

21:06.220 --> 21:07.390
I could get used to it.

21:08.030 --> 21:09.700
So what do you want to do?

21:10.480 --> 21:11.890
I wouldn't mind watching the game.

21:14.060 --> 21:15.250
I wouldn't mind either.

21:24.440 --> 21:26.860
Frankly, I don't even think that Jenna's Monte's type.

21:26.860 --> 21:27.910
How would you know what her type is?

21:27.910 --> 21:29.360
You didn't even know she was gay.

21:29.360 --> 21:31.980
Neither does she, which also worries me for Jenna.

21:33.020 --> 21:34.060
Hey, boo. What's up?

21:34.060 --> 21:35.860
Hey. Can I help with dinner?

21:35.860 --> 21:36.660
Aren't you sweet?

21:36.660 --> 21:39.140
But actually we have friends coming over last-minute.

21:39.140 --> 21:41.190
And we are gonna order you guys some pizza. Is that okay?

21:41.190 --> 21:41.870
Sure.

21:42.580 --> 21:45.070
- So, mom. - Yeah?

21:45.470 --> 21:47.460
I was thinking about what you said

21:47.470 --> 21:48.850
about how after you were shot

21:48.850 --> 21:51.700
you went to the shooting range and you felt better.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.860
And I was thinking

21:55.190 --> 21:57.240
maybe you could take me,

21:57.780 --> 21:59.340
so you could teach me to shoot.

22:00.060 --> 22:01.740
Why would you want to learn how to shoot a gun?

22:02.310 --> 22:05.430
I just don't want to be scared.

22:05.990 --> 22:07.990
Well, I think you should be scared.

22:08.280 --> 22:10.450
Why don't you let mama and I talk about it?

22:10.450 --> 22:11.810
- All right? - Okay.

22:13.990 --> 22:16.400
It's just I sort of

22:16.400 --> 22:18.060
told Connor that you were gonna take me,

22:18.060 --> 22:19.620
and now he wants to come too.

22:19.930 --> 22:22.180
Okay, let us talk, all right?

22:25.900 --> 22:27.630
Well, I hope you agree the answer is no.

22:32.310 --> 22:33.830
Hey, you're early.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.530
Yeah, traffic was light.

22:37.810 --> 22:40.470
I hope it's okay-- I invited A.J. to dinner.

22:42.590 --> 22:43.980
Uh, yeah, sure.

22:44.400 --> 22:45.060
Great.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.190
I tape this so we can watch it later.

22:48.190 --> 22:50.170
No, that's okay. I'll watch.

22:50.180 --> 22:51.680
- You sure? - Yeah.

22:52.330 --> 22:53.470
Who's playing?

22:53.860 --> 22:56.740
Dude, it's the finals. How do you not know who's playing?

22:57.470 --> 22:59.040
Brandon's not really into sports.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.320
Music's his thing. 

23:00.320 --> 23:03.340
He actually got accepted into a very prestigious music camp 

23:03.340 --> 23:04.530
as a classical composer.

23:04.530 --> 23:08.490
- Dad. - What, I can't brag about my super-talented son?

23:08.490 --> 23:09.580
So if you're not into sports,

23:09.580 --> 23:11.950
what's up with that Tony Gwynn ball in your room?

23:12.790 --> 23:15.500
That was a gift from my grandfather.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.260
He was a big Padres fan.

23:17.270 --> 23:18.730
Me and my brother used to watch the game

23:18.810 --> 23:20.700
from up on the water tower by the stadium.

23:20.700 --> 23:24.210
You know what, B? We should take A.J. to a game.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.840
I got a buddy who can get us seats behind home plate.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.150
- For real? - Yeah, for real.

23:31.790 --> 23:34.590
Speaking of my brother. Have you heard anything?

23:35.220 --> 23:38.030
The good news is, we have every reason to believe he's alive.

23:38.040 --> 23:40.520
There's no death certificate issued under his name,

23:40.520 --> 23:42.570
no john doe that fits his description.

23:44.410 --> 23:47.660
I mean, look, I can keep running his name through the system,

23:47.660 --> 23:49.500
but I gotta be honest--

23:49.500 --> 23:51.050
unless he commits a crime,

23:51.620 --> 23:54.610
it's not easy to find someone who doesn't want to be found.

23:59.470 --> 24:00.470
How do I look?

24:01.650 --> 24:03.040
Verizon say neversettle.

24:03.050 --> 24:04.160
Oh my god.

24:12.810 --> 24:15.410
I-- I mean, hi.

24:17.820 --> 24:20.690
Anyhow, when Lena met Stef,

24:21.010 --> 24:23.260
Stef and I became fast friends.

24:23.260 --> 24:24.950
and then, lucky for me,

24:24.950 --> 24:26.670
I got them both in the divorce.

24:26.670 --> 24:28.140
Yeah, lucky for her is right.

24:29.660 --> 24:32.310
Wait, so I've never heard the story of how you two met.

24:33.700 --> 24:35.620
Well, I was-- I--

24:35.630 --> 24:37.860
Well, I thought I was straight

24:37.860 --> 24:41.390
and separated from Brandon's father,

24:41.390 --> 24:43.400
looking for a school for Brandon.

24:43.400 --> 24:47.080
And, lo and behold, guess who was the head of admissions but...

24:47.740 --> 24:51.010
And I started lingering after drop-off,

24:51.010 --> 24:53.380
Um, then we went to lunch and to dinner,

24:53.380 --> 24:55.750
And then I kissed her. And her face--

24:55.750 --> 24:57.350
It was so cute.

24:57.360 --> 24:59.170
I think she was a little surprised.

25:00.420 --> 25:01.840
Of course, I was still trying to convince myself 

25:01.840 --> 25:03.150
that I was into men.

25:03.980 --> 25:05.740
And Lena was in a relationship.

25:05.740 --> 25:07.710
Which wasn't serious, obviously.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.490
But I knew I was in love.

25:09.490 --> 25:11.770
Well, who wouldn't be? I mean, look at her.

25:11.780 --> 25:13.300
I'd marry her right now.

25:13.950 --> 25:16.710
I'm kidding. I mean, I'm totally kidding.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.470
Anyhow, it's not like you just suddenly were gay.

25:21.470 --> 25:23.850
I mean, you had crushes. And you had--

25:23.850 --> 25:25.770
You had that whole thing with the girl in college.

25:25.770 --> 25:28.020
Come on, every girl had something in college.

25:28.030 --> 25:29.940
No, no, not everyone. I didn't.

25:29.940 --> 25:31.070
You didn't?

25:31.070 --> 25:32.050
I didn't know that.

25:33.090 --> 25:35.020
How about you, Monte? Did you?

25:35.850 --> 25:37.370
No, actually. 

25:37.370 --> 25:42.250
I-- I mean, I've had crushes, I guess.

25:45.950 --> 25:47.360
So who's ready for some dessert?

25:47.360 --> 25:49.400
You know, I am. But I need to use the restroom first.

25:49.410 --> 25:50.490
Do you remember where it is?

25:50.490 --> 25:52.810
I do, yeah. Excuse me.

25:56.930 --> 25:59.330
Stop looking at her ass, Jenna.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.560
- Monte. - Hi, Callie.

26:03.750 --> 26:06.010
Can I come and talk to you tomorrow?

26:06.010 --> 26:08.590
I have something I want to ask you about my independent study,

26:08.590 --> 26:10.060
- If that would be okay. - Okay.

26:10.060 --> 26:12.550
Why don't you come by my office tomorrow after class?

26:12.550 --> 26:14.320
Excuse me, I gotta use the little girls' room.

26:25.470 --> 26:26.300
What's with him?

26:26.790 --> 26:28.630
Beats me. I hardly know the guy.

26:29.510 --> 26:30.450
You really trust him?

26:31.520 --> 26:32.500
Why do you ask?

26:32.900 --> 26:34.490
You're the reason he's here, right?

26:34.490 --> 26:36.320
Well, did you trust me when I first got here?

26:37.010 --> 26:39.980
I don't know. But you were a lot prettier.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.690
So what you're saying is I'm not pretty anymore?

26:44.150 --> 26:46.860
I just don't want to see my dad get played, you know?

26:46.860 --> 26:47.770
I gotta get to work.

26:53.090 --> 26:55.380
Okay, can we talk about Jenna

26:55.380 --> 26:57.430
when Monte walked into the kitchen?

26:57.430 --> 27:00.020
"Wow." What was that?

27:00.020 --> 27:01.580
She has no filter.

27:02.910 --> 27:05.240
Yeah, I think I detected a little bit of a spark though.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.870
I still don't think Monte's a lesbian.

27:07.870 --> 27:09.380
- What? - And if they dated,

27:09.380 --> 27:11.560
I just-- I wouldn't feel comfortable with Jenna

27:11.560 --> 27:14.300
sharing personal stuff about us with my boss.

27:14.300 --> 27:18.010
You shared personal stuff about us with your boss.

27:18.010 --> 27:19.990
And that was a mistake.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.160
I regret it. And I'm sorry.

27:22.160 --> 27:24.320
And I have been very careful

27:24.320 --> 27:25.920
not to cross that line again.

27:26.500 --> 27:27.400
Thank you.

27:32.380 --> 27:35.880
Oh, you know, Adam called me and said

27:35.880 --> 27:38.640
that apparently Connor is very, very excited

27:38.640 --> 27:40.290
about going to the shooting range.

27:40.290 --> 27:43.310
And he said it's okay if I take him, so...

27:43.990 --> 27:45.920
You've never taken any of the other kids.

27:45.920 --> 27:47.370
I know. Maybe I should.

27:47.370 --> 27:48.900
We've got a gun in the house.

27:49.350 --> 27:50.270
I know I keep it locked up,

27:50.270 --> 27:53.320
but, you know, it's not a bad thing

27:53.320 --> 27:55.760
to teach them about gun safety,

27:55.760 --> 27:57.870
especially if they're curious.

27:57.870 --> 27:59.650
Honestly, it doesn't seem like Jude

27:59.740 --> 28:02.560
to be curious about something like this.

28:02.560 --> 28:05.560
You really think he's gonna feel better after shooting a gun?

28:07.830 --> 28:09.580
I don't know. Maybe.

28:11.510 --> 28:12.790
I did.

28:36.650 --> 28:39.180
I just wanted to say thank you again for last night.

28:39.180 --> 28:40.940
I hope Jenna wasn't too--

28:40.940 --> 28:43.660
No, but, I mean, I did think

28:43.660 --> 28:45.830
- She was a little... - Enthusiastic?

28:46.390 --> 28:47.480
At first.

28:47.480 --> 28:48.980
But then,

28:49.140 --> 28:51.890
well, we actually went out for a drink

28:51.890 --> 28:53.070
after we left your house.

28:53.070 --> 28:55.930
And she's very funny and interesting.

28:56.890 --> 28:59.600
So you think you want to see her again?

28:59.600 --> 29:01.130
I'd like to.

29:02.010 --> 29:04.140
Unless you don't want me to, for some reason.

29:04.140 --> 29:06.430
I don't want you to date any women.

29:08.730 --> 29:09.920
I mean--

29:10.980 --> 29:12.710
What I mean is that...

29:15.120 --> 29:17.680
I want you to be straight.

29:18.470 --> 29:19.830
Because if you're straight,

29:19.830 --> 29:22.870
then there's no reason

29:22.870 --> 29:25.780
for me to tell my wife that you tried to kiss me,

29:25.780 --> 29:28.690
because it really didn't mean anything.

29:28.690 --> 29:32.220
But if you're gay, then not telling her...

29:32.220 --> 29:34.620
Is like a betrayal.

29:40.800 --> 29:42.530
So what if you tell her?

29:42.530 --> 29:46.110
She's certainly not gonna feel great about us working together.

29:46.110 --> 29:48.800
So sorry I put you in this position,

29:49.710 --> 29:51.760
But it's not like you kissed me.

29:51.760 --> 29:54.310
It's just something stupid I did.

29:54.310 --> 29:57.400
And if it's just gonna make Stef uncomfortable,

29:58.820 --> 30:01.070
is there really any point?

30:02.870 --> 30:05.020
So manifest destiny

30:05.020 --> 30:07.220
was stimulated by nationalism,

30:07.220 --> 30:09.550
but also by an idealistic vision

30:09.550 --> 30:11.490
of human perfectibility.

30:11.490 --> 30:12.770
Now it was believed at the time

30:12.770 --> 30:15.440
that it was America's duty to extend

30:15.440 --> 30:18.390
liberty and democratic institutions

30:18.390 --> 30:19.820
across the continent.

30:19.820 --> 30:21.770
Uh, excuse me.

30:21.770 --> 30:24.850
Are you not interested in manifest destiny?

30:24.850 --> 30:26.960
No, just destined for the bathroom.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.630
Is that okay?

30:28.630 --> 30:29.780
Yeah.

30:30.940 --> 30:34.010
So, as I was saying, manifest--

30:34.010 --> 30:35.420
Can I use the bathroom too, please?

30:35.420 --> 30:38.440
Callie, you know the rules. One at a time.

30:38.600 --> 30:41.290
So in 1836...

30:41.830 --> 30:42.990
I just had a customer

30:42.990 --> 30:45.560
who asked about our churronuts,

30:45.560 --> 30:47.540
third one today, in fact.

30:48.710 --> 30:49.980
You know, that's so funny,

30:49.980 --> 30:53.430
because we actually had someone ask us the exact same thing.

30:53.430 --> 30:55.220
I wonder where people are getting the idea

30:55.220 --> 30:57.420
we served something trendy like that?

30:57.420 --> 30:58.920
Hmm, I wonder.

30:58.920 --> 31:01.980
But, I mean, it's what the people want.

31:02.240 --> 31:03.610
Actually, I know where.

31:03.610 --> 31:05.180
I asked one young lady, and she said

31:05.180 --> 31:07.980
she got something called a "Tweet"

31:07.980 --> 31:09.960
sent to her from someone called

31:09.960 --> 31:12.820
@Marianamissthing?

31:12.820 --> 31:15.960
Okay, but before you say anything,

31:15.960 --> 31:17.400
take a look.

31:24.790 --> 31:27.760
*M'm'm'my churronut*

31:28.690 --> 31:30.200
Isn't it awesome?

31:30.200 --> 31:32.410
Mariana's, like, a computer genius.

31:32.410 --> 31:33.760
It is awesome.

31:34.150 --> 31:35.800
But we don't sell churronuts,

31:35.800 --> 31:38.260
Not now, not ever.

31:38.260 --> 31:39.030
Because...

31:39.030 --> 31:41.390
Tradicion es para siempre.

31:41.770 --> 31:43.990
But this bakery isn't going to be forever

31:43.990 --> 31:46.500
if you don't do something to bring business in.

31:47.070 --> 31:49.720
Mariana, you're new to this family,

31:49.720 --> 31:50.950
But you--

31:51.970 --> 31:53.970
You know better, mija.

31:57.670 --> 31:59.300
I'm so sorry.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.050
This is gonna be awesome.

32:10.050 --> 32:11.290
Okay, did you guys see me practice.

32:11.290 --> 32:14.350
The three "Always," Like we talked about? What are they?

32:14.350 --> 32:16.470
Always point the firearm in a safe direction.

32:16.470 --> 32:19.560
- Right. - Always assume it's loaded. And, um...

32:19.560 --> 32:20.480
Always keep your finger

32:20.480 --> 32:22.380
off the trigger until you're ready to fire.

32:22.380 --> 32:24.670
Good job. All right, Jude, you want to go first?

32:24.670 --> 32:26.580
- Okay. - All right.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.300
All right, now your stance is,

32:29.300 --> 32:31.650
your feet are shoulder-width apart, okay?

32:31.650 --> 32:35.030
Pick up the gun. Finger off the trigger. Well done.

32:35.030 --> 32:36.390
And you're gonna use this hand to cup

32:36.390 --> 32:38.820
underneath your dominant hand. There you go.

32:38.820 --> 32:41.400
Now you're gonna line this sight up

32:41.400 --> 32:43.320
in between these two sights back here.

32:43.320 --> 32:46.050
- Okay. - Okay, go for it.

32:56.000 --> 32:56.750
Jude?

32:58.260 --> 32:59.610
I don't want to shoot it.

32:59.610 --> 33:01.870
- Why not? - I don't need to.

33:02.020 --> 33:04.310
All right. You want to give it a shot?

33:04.310 --> 33:05.680
Yeah, totally.

33:10.900 --> 33:13.630
Okay, your stance... feet are shoulder-width apart.

33:13.630 --> 33:15.720
Finger off the trigger. Okay?

33:15.720 --> 33:18.690
You line up your sights-- this one in between these two.

33:18.690 --> 33:21.580
Yeah, I know how to do it. It's just like in the game.

33:27.910 --> 33:28.490
Who's there?

33:40.090 --> 33:41.040
You okay?

33:43.080 --> 33:45.860
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. That was cool.

33:46.030 --> 33:47.450
Yeah.

33:47.910 --> 33:49.570
Want to sit down for a sec?

33:50.130 --> 33:51.520
No, I'm okay.

33:51.520 --> 33:54.700
I'm actually... I'm gonna go wait outside.

34:02.010 --> 34:04.510
- Where's A.J.? - He's gone.

34:07.550 --> 34:09.400
- You think he might be here? - I don't know.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.100
This is where he used to come to meet his brother

34:11.100 --> 34:12.280
when they were in separate homes.

34:12.280 --> 34:14.659
Maybe he thinks he'll find him here.

34:15.239 --> 34:16.800
It's a pretty big park.

34:16.800 --> 34:17.810
You okay if we split up?

34:17.810 --> 34:19.429
- Yeah. - Okay.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.420
- You got your phone? - Yeah.

34:34.270 --> 34:35.310
You okay?

34:37.239 --> 34:38.449
I'm fine.

34:39.560 --> 34:41.560
I never wanted to shoot a gun.

34:41.560 --> 34:45.040
My mom wasn't gonna take me shooting.

34:45.040 --> 34:48.030
I just said that because I was embarrassed

34:48.030 --> 34:50.199
that I didn't want to play that zombie game.

34:50.199 --> 34:51.929
Why were you embarrassed?

34:52.090 --> 34:54.010
You call me a granny.

34:57.330 --> 34:59.230
I don't know. I guess I'm...

34:59.360 --> 35:01.120
I'm not okay.

35:29.280 --> 35:30.990
You know, it was my dad who took me to the gun range

35:30.990 --> 35:33.150
for the first time when I was about your age.

35:33.860 --> 35:37.150
Man, was I excited to shoot a real gun.

35:37.150 --> 35:38.740
I walked up to that firing line,

35:38.740 --> 35:41.990
aiming my gun for the head and fired

35:42.390 --> 35:44.550
and immediately burst into tears.

35:44.550 --> 35:45.600
I was so embarrassed.

35:45.600 --> 35:48.590
I knew my dad was gonna give me a hard time about it.

35:48.590 --> 35:49.520
But you know what? He didn't.

35:49.520 --> 35:51.420
He said he was really proud of me

35:51.420 --> 35:55.920
for recognizing that shooting a gun is not a game.

35:55.920 --> 35:59.320
It's very, very real and has very real consequences.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.240
He always told me that his goal as a police officer

36:01.240 --> 36:05.550
was to never have to shoot his firearm on the job.

36:05.550 --> 36:08.200
Never did. Never got shot at.

36:09.440 --> 36:11.710
And we can't say that, can we?

36:13.170 --> 36:15.630
We can talk about it though, you know.

36:15.630 --> 36:17.750
I know I need to.

36:18.420 --> 36:21.530
It's important. It's important for me, that's for sure.

36:23.310 --> 36:25.880
I didn't remember much after it happened.

36:27.020 --> 36:30.010
- But now sometimes... - You dream about it?

36:31.810 --> 36:33.330
Yeah, me too.

36:35.410 --> 36:37.400
It's weird. It's not the same.

36:37.400 --> 36:39.990
It's not the same scenario...

36:51.130 --> 36:52.140
A.J.

36:55.410 --> 36:58.170
- What are you doing here? - It's a free country.

37:01.870 --> 37:04.450
This where you and your brother used to meet?

37:07.740 --> 37:10.740
Being up here would make me feel like a superhero too.

37:15.260 --> 37:16.940
So what's the plan?

37:17.530 --> 37:21.210
Just gonna wait up here until he shows, if he shows?

37:21.210 --> 37:22.660
Why do you care?

37:22.660 --> 37:24.250
You don't want me around.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.370
Mike does.

37:26.370 --> 37:28.020
He's not gonna look for Ty.

37:28.020 --> 37:30.040
- Who says? - He said.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.780
He said it's a waste of time.

37:32.780 --> 37:35.730
He said you can't find someone that doesn't want to be found.

37:36.700 --> 37:38.170
Well, he's here,

37:38.170 --> 37:40.940
wasting his time looking for you right now.

37:42.080 --> 37:43.360
So...

37:46.460 --> 37:48.230
I've been where you are.

37:50.900 --> 37:54.020
And at a certain point, you just...

37:54.020 --> 37:57.840
you have to learn to trust somebody.

38:02.210 --> 38:04.510
Ty is not gonna know where to find me.

38:04.670 --> 38:06.560
So you'll find him.

38:07.590 --> 38:09.350
And Mike will help you.

38:16.140 --> 38:18.600
I quit. You don't need the help,

38:18.600 --> 38:21.040
and you don't have to pay me to get to know me.

38:21.040 --> 38:22.730
And I may not know how things work in this family,

38:22.730 --> 38:24.200
but I do know that business is bad

38:24.200 --> 38:27.560
and things aren't going to get better by refusing to try new things.

38:27.560 --> 38:31.130
And Adriana just wants to help you, because she loves you.

38:32.950 --> 38:33.870
Okay.

38:33.870 --> 38:37.440
Well, that's all I wanted to say,

38:37.610 --> 38:38.960
except it might interest you to know

38:38.960 --> 38:41.800
that a cronut sells for approximately $6 apiece,

38:41.800 --> 38:43.480
which is seven times more than a donut

38:43.480 --> 38:45.370
and 3.5 times more than a croissant,

38:45.370 --> 38:47.350
Which I don't have to tell you is a high profit...

38:47.350 --> 38:49.010
Okay.

38:49.580 --> 38:51.210
Okay what?

38:51.680 --> 38:53.470
Let's make churronuts.

38:54.310 --> 38:58.340
Did you hear that? We're making churronuts!

39:00.630 --> 39:03.350
Aren't you supposed to, like, arrest me or something?

39:03.350 --> 39:05.050
Nah, I'm off duty.

39:05.050 --> 39:06.970
Besides, I didn't see anything.

39:15.780 --> 39:18.450
You sure you're okay with me putting your number up here?

39:18.450 --> 39:20.660
You know what? I hadn't even thought of that.

39:21.520 --> 39:22.490
Can you take it down?

39:22.490 --> 39:24.340
- Yeah. - I'm kidding.

39:25.370 --> 39:27.210
It's not my number.

39:27.920 --> 39:29.500
It's yours.

39:29.830 --> 39:31.330
I got you this for before,

39:31.330 --> 39:34.530
you know, in case we ever needed to get in touch with each other.

39:36.260 --> 39:39.350
Now, if Ty shows up, he can get in touch too.

39:41.740 --> 39:43.700
Come on, let's get you home.

39:48.460 --> 39:51.320
*M'm'm'my churronuts*

40:09.620 --> 40:12.360
Okay, come with me right now.

40:12.360 --> 40:14.510
- Where are we going? - I need your help.

40:14.670 --> 40:17.700
- It's an app? - I'm gonna call it "Fost and found,"

40:17.700 --> 40:20.930
so Foster kids can find each other and communicate.

40:20.930 --> 40:22.400
I think this is a great idea.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.600
Mariana's gonna help me code.

40:25.280 --> 40:26.060
I am.

40:26.060 --> 40:28.420
Okay, but what happened to the drop-in center?

40:28.420 --> 40:30.200
Well, this is a drop-in center...

40:30.200 --> 40:32.780
just for kids who can't physically drop in.

40:32.780 --> 40:34.680
Is this what you wanted to talk to Monte about?

40:34.680 --> 40:37.460
Uh, no. I mean, sort of.

40:38.150 --> 40:40.870
I actually just got this idea from A.J.

40:40.870 --> 40:41.920
This app would kind of be

40:41.920 --> 40:44.180
like giving every kid their own bat signal.

40:44.180 --> 40:47.320
And, Mariana, you're gonna have time to help out with this?

40:47.320 --> 40:49.500
I guess.

40:49.730 --> 40:51.830
I mean, totally.

40:51.830 --> 40:53.950
I don't see any reason why Monte

40:53.950 --> 40:55.690
and the teachers' board wouldn't approve this.

40:55.690 --> 40:57.410
Thank you. Thank you.

40:57.410 --> 41:00.300
Okay, why don't you two go set the table for dinner, please?

41:04.890 --> 41:07.840
I would say A.J.'s been a good influence so far.

41:18.830 --> 41:20.330
What the hell are you doing?
