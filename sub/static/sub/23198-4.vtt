02:24.179 --> 02:26.773
Welcome to America, Lieutenant Wertz.

02:31.753 --> 02:33.414
Good to see a fellow countryman...

02:33.488 --> 02:36.252
after six months of speaking to no one
but these Yankees.

02:36.324 --> 02:39.657
Landing anywhere would be welcome
after five days in that submarine.

02:39.727 --> 02:42.719
In the Air Force, we could have crossed
the Atlantic 20 times.

02:42.797 --> 02:44.765
You'll soon be in the air again. Come.

03:34.916 --> 03:37.315
They haven't even rolled her out yet.

03:37.784 --> 03:39.445
It's just as well.

03:42.022 --> 03:45.958
Don't worry, Lieutenant,
everything is going according to schedule.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.755
How can you be so confident?

03:47.828 --> 03:51.286
I'll tell you my secret:
It's to know your adversary.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.594
I know the American military mind.

03:54.901 --> 03:58.598
If they schedule something
to happen at 0700 hours...

03:58.905 --> 04:00.964
then that's exactly when it will happen.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.669
Not a moment earlier, not a moment later.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.286
- Hi, Steve.
- Peter, it's good to see you.

04:18.358 --> 04:21.452
Peter, this is Yeoman Diana Prince.
Diana, this is Peter Knight.

04:21.528 --> 04:24.793
He's the genius mainly responsible
for what's happening here today.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.730
You designed the XPJ-1?

04:26.800 --> 04:29.268
Not really.
A man in England designed the engine...

04:29.336 --> 04:31.361
I just built the plane to put it in.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.373
Wait until you see it,
Diana. It is beautiful.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.323
There it is.

04:58.865 --> 05:00.730
It's amazing, isn't it?

05:00.867 --> 05:03.028
Yes, it's very impressive.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.476
You see, there's no propeller.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.081
- How does it fly?
- Jet propulsion.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.550
And it really flies?

05:18.618 --> 05:20.017
Like a bird.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.347
- Are you ready?
- I guess so.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.957
You really are a genius.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.685
I'll get my gear.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.131
I knew you'd be surprised.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.964
This is why I've been taking
that secret training course.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.503
Surprised? I am amazed!

05:38.271 --> 05:40.239
- Are you sure it's safe?
- It's safe.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.901
It's incredibly fast
and maneuvers like a dream.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.068
That's wonderful.

05:44.144 --> 05:46.169
The enemy's working on
one of their own...

05:46.246 --> 05:47.770
but they're eight months behind.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.180
With an edge like that,
we'll really have them.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.616
I hope so. I truly hope so.

05:53.286 --> 05:56.153
You stay here by the car.
You'll be able to see everything.

05:56.223 --> 05:57.587
- Fine.
- Bye.

05:57.656 --> 05:58.987
- Steve.
- Yes?

05:59.058 --> 06:00.389
Good luck.

06:03.763 --> 06:06.095
Are you sure that thing can fly?

06:06.966 --> 06:08.331
It flies.

06:09.435 --> 06:10.959
And you can fly it?

06:11.036 --> 06:12.628
We have copies of their plans.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.367
I've studied the controls so much
I know them by heart.

06:15.441 --> 06:17.432
Good. Then let's put you behind them.

06:24.583 --> 06:25.743
Ready to go?

08:14.293 --> 08:15.920
Thanks, Wonder Woman.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.622
I'm sorry, Steve.

08:18.030 --> 08:21.897
- Where's Diana? I hope she's all right.
- Don't worry about Diana. I'll find her.

08:21.966 --> 08:25.231
Thanks again.
I've got to get to the control tower.

08:46.457 --> 08:49.085
Red Control, this is Red Leader.
Come in, Red Control.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.720
This is Red Control,
reading you loud and clear.

08:52.163 --> 08:54.757
Red Control, this is Red Leader.
Code Z is in effect.

08:55.099 --> 08:57.966
I repeat, Code Z is in effect.

09:01.105 --> 09:04.097
Roger, Red Leader. Code Z is in effect.

09:20.325 --> 09:23.089
She should be well clear of land by now.

09:48.386 --> 09:52.755
Red Leader, this is Red Control.
Code Z has been successfully completed.

09:55.159 --> 09:58.390
Red Control, this is Red Leader.
Roger, very good.

09:59.330 --> 10:01.059
We stopped them for now...

10:01.132 --> 10:03.657
but you better bet
there's gonna be a next time.

10:13.811 --> 10:16.336
You saw her, I suppose. Wonder Woman?

10:16.414 --> 10:17.608
Not really.

10:17.682 --> 10:22.619
When it all started I ran behind the hangar.
By the time I came back, she was gone.

10:23.588 --> 10:28.116
Steve, it's really a shame
that we couldn't have saved the XPJ-1.

10:29.627 --> 10:31.026
That poor Peter Knight.

10:31.095 --> 10:34.462
He was almost in tears
over the loss of his airplane.

10:34.832 --> 10:36.823
We had to keep Code Z a secret.

10:36.901 --> 10:39.768
Nobody knew about it
but General Blankenship and myself.

10:39.837 --> 10:40.861
And now you.

10:40.938 --> 10:44.338
If you were expecting
something like this to happen...

10:44.408 --> 10:47.502
then you obviously have new plans
for the XPJ-1.

10:48.412 --> 10:49.504
We have.

10:49.579 --> 10:52.673
General Blankenship's gonna tell us
all about it this afternoon.

10:52.749 --> 10:56.515
In the meantime, the Nazis
will think the XPJ-1 is a failure...

10:56.586 --> 10:59.521
and they'll turn their attentions elsewhere.

11:06.863 --> 11:09.457
You're a lucky man, Lieutenant Wertz.

11:09.599 --> 11:10.930
Your plane explodes...

11:11.001 --> 11:14.767
and one of our submarines
is able to pluck you from the sea.

11:15.472 --> 11:17.963
Our mission was still not a failure.

11:18.041 --> 11:21.306
At least we know now
their experimental jet plane is no good.

11:21.378 --> 11:23.346
I'd like to think so...

11:24.848 --> 11:28.215
but it's too simple, too straightforward.

11:28.518 --> 11:31.351
- I don't understand.
- Nor do I, yet.

11:33.190 --> 11:35.158
What about the others on your mission?

11:35.225 --> 11:37.625
Taken prisoner. All except Captain Radl...

11:37.694 --> 11:40.629
who's obviously still somewhere
in the United States.

11:55.312 --> 11:57.507
Hi, Tom. Nice day.

12:01.785 --> 12:03.616
It's gonna be a hot one.

12:04.020 --> 12:05.385
It sure is.

12:07.858 --> 12:09.155
See you.

12:14.664 --> 12:16.393
It's all right now.

12:19.903 --> 12:22.872
I'll need clothes, money, a car, and papers.

12:22.939 --> 12:25.339
But first, I must contact Berlin.

12:58.074 --> 13:00.634
How about something to eat?
You've got to be starved.

13:00.710 --> 13:02.575
Later. I must contact Berlin first.

13:05.748 --> 13:09.206
- I told you, I must make my report first!
- I heard you.

13:30.039 --> 13:32.030
Make it fast. The longer you transmit...

13:32.107 --> 13:35.338
the more chance the Americans will
pick up the signal and get a fix.

13:54.163 --> 13:55.528
That's it.

13:56.732 --> 13:58.791
It's Berlin's problem now.

13:59.034 --> 14:00.262
What is?

14:01.170 --> 14:03.536
You heard we lost the XPJ-1.

14:04.073 --> 14:05.540
Yes, Berlin told me.

14:05.608 --> 14:08.668
Well, the Americans have got
a secret weapon...

14:09.144 --> 14:13.080
that makes the XPJ-1
pale into insignificance.

14:17.353 --> 14:20.345
A weapon, if properly utilized...

14:20.422 --> 14:23.357
could finish this war in a matter of weeks.

14:25.895 --> 14:27.226
Hemmschler.

14:27.596 --> 14:30.064
General Ulrich!
What an honor to have you...

14:30.132 --> 14:31.895
Enough, Hemmschler, enough.

14:31.967 --> 14:36.233
This agent of yours, Captain Radl,
how reliable is he?

14:37.539 --> 14:39.905
His record speaks for itself, General.

14:39.975 --> 14:42.637
I'm not questioning
whether he's brave or resourceful.

14:42.711 --> 14:45.009
I'm here to find out if he's reliable.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.945
This report of his you've sent me...

14:47.016 --> 14:49.849
can it be taken as accurate
beyond a doubt?

14:50.319 --> 14:52.514
Beyond any shadow of a doubt.

14:54.690 --> 14:56.749
Bullet deflecting metal...

14:57.893 --> 15:00.828
worn as bracelets by a woman?

15:01.597 --> 15:05.693
Sir, there have been other reports
about this woman.

15:05.768 --> 15:07.861
They appear on my desk
from time to time.

15:07.937 --> 15:11.031
Like you, I was under the impression
they were the outcome of...

15:11.106 --> 15:12.300
shall we say...

15:12.374 --> 15:16.674
an excessive imagination on the part of
battle-fatigued witnesses?

15:17.046 --> 15:18.946
I know Captain Radl...

15:19.481 --> 15:21.813
and he just would not exaggerate.

15:21.884 --> 15:23.579
I'd stake my life on that.

15:23.652 --> 15:25.676
You may well be doing so.

15:29.023 --> 15:31.753
A superior, very strong woman.

15:33.194 --> 15:35.890
If only we could learn
the secret of her strength...

15:35.964 --> 15:37.829
and the bracelets she wears...

15:37.899 --> 15:40.527
the material from which they are made.

15:40.601 --> 15:42.501
Imagine, Hemmschler...

15:42.904 --> 15:46.738
a panzer group with tanks
that are impervious to Allied guns.

15:47.342 --> 15:51.540
Submarines that cannot be sunk,
aircraft that cannot be shot down...

15:55.016 --> 15:57.883
Very well, you have full authority.

15:58.619 --> 16:01.554
Do whatever is necessary
to find that woman...

16:01.622 --> 16:04.352
and locate that extraordinary material.

16:05.093 --> 16:07.186
Spare no effort, Hemmschler.

16:07.328 --> 16:10.627
We must find out what it is
and where it comes from.

16:43.331 --> 16:45.128
Let the games begin!

17:26.406 --> 17:27.396
Good!

18:25.098 --> 18:27.760
Your daughter grows stronger
and more agile every day.

18:27.834 --> 18:31.099
Yes, she grows more and more
like her older sister.

18:40.213 --> 18:41.612
Two against one.

18:41.681 --> 18:43.808
And yet her team's evenly matched.

18:46.086 --> 18:49.180
Magda, ask the Princess Drusilla
to join us.

18:49.322 --> 18:51.085
Yes, Your Highness.

18:59.332 --> 19:02.165
Princess Dru,
Her Majesty wants to see you.

19:04.804 --> 19:06.738
You sent for me, Your Majesty?

19:06.806 --> 19:08.637
Not as the queen, as your mother.

19:08.708 --> 19:10.335
Leave us, Dalma.

19:16.950 --> 19:19.282
You excel in the games. It pleases me.

19:19.352 --> 19:21.047
Thank you, Mother.

19:21.221 --> 19:23.519
I hear you're doing well in your studies.

19:23.590 --> 19:24.682
Thank you.

19:24.758 --> 19:27.386
- Your instructors like you.
- I like them.

19:27.460 --> 19:30.361
Then why did you put the grass snake
down Magda's back?

19:30.430 --> 19:32.830
You know poor Magda's
deathly afraid of snakes.

19:32.899 --> 19:36.699
But, Mother, you should have seen her.
She went four different shades of green.

19:36.770 --> 19:38.431
We are not amused.

19:39.005 --> 19:41.735
You would have been had you been there.

19:41.908 --> 19:45.969
While I strongly disapprove,
that's not the reason I sent for you.

19:47.314 --> 19:51.182
Dalma told you about me nailing
Magda's sandals to the floor.

19:51.351 --> 19:52.875
No, she did not!

19:54.087 --> 19:56.214
We'll talk about that later, too.

19:56.289 --> 19:58.814
Right now,
I want to discuss something with you...

19:58.892 --> 20:01.190
that's best done
by a member of our family.

20:01.261 --> 20:04.856
Not another
how-to-be-heir-to-the-throne lesson.

20:04.931 --> 20:06.831
Diana's the heir, Mother, not me.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.629
I'm very well aware of that.

20:08.702 --> 20:11.602
But it's your older sister
that I wish to talk to you about.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.695
When I sent her away to America...

20:13.772 --> 20:16.297
I had no idea
she would become such a legend...

20:16.375 --> 20:18.138
as Wonder Woman.

20:18.344 --> 20:22.337
But now, I think it's time that she return
and resume her duties.

20:22.548 --> 20:24.675
Besides, I miss her.

20:25.451 --> 20:27.544
I want my family around me.

20:28.153 --> 20:31.088
That's why
I want you to go to the United States...

20:31.156 --> 20:32.714
to Washington, D. C...

20:32.791 --> 20:35.726
and bring Diana back here
to Paradise Island.

20:42.868 --> 20:46.235
The new XPJ-1 engine arrives by ship
from England tomorrow...

20:46.305 --> 20:49.001
where it'll be taken directly
to the same facility.

20:49.074 --> 20:51.565
It will be mounted
in the second prototype airframe.

20:51.644 --> 20:54.238
Peter Knight will have to be told.
He does all the work.

20:54.313 --> 20:55.712
You take care of that, Steve.

20:55.781 --> 20:58.648
I want you to prepare
for another test flight in five days.

20:58.717 --> 20:59.775
That soon?

20:59.852 --> 21:01.979
We fooled the Nazis temporarily.

21:02.054 --> 21:04.682
For the moment,
we have an advantage over them.

21:04.757 --> 21:06.622
Let's keep it that way.

21:06.692 --> 21:08.353
Yes, sir. Will that be all?

21:08.427 --> 21:10.452
For the moment. Thank you.

21:15.734 --> 21:18.601
Diana, call Peter Knight.
Arrange for us to have dinner.

21:18.671 --> 21:21.105
- I've got some important news for him.
- Yes, sir.

21:21.173 --> 21:23.505
Make it someplace quiet so we can talk.

21:23.575 --> 21:27.602
Well, how about my place?
I'm really a terrific cook.

21:27.680 --> 21:30.205
- Are you sure it's not an imposition?
- Positive.

21:30.282 --> 21:32.250
Would 7:00 be all right?

21:32.518 --> 21:33.985
7:00 is fine.

21:44.897 --> 21:47.457
I don't suppose you could make it for four?

21:47.533 --> 21:50.263
Etta, I wish I could. But you heard Steve.

21:50.336 --> 21:53.601
He has important business to discuss
with Peter Knight.

21:53.672 --> 21:56.607
Business or social,
I never get to go out to dinner.

21:56.675 --> 22:00.475
I'll make you a promise.
I'll take you out to dinner sometime.

22:00.546 --> 22:04.243
It's not the same, Diana.
I mean, you're not a man.

22:04.316 --> 22:06.978
I've always been very happy about that.

23:01.305 --> 23:03.637
- Drusilla!
- Hi, Diana!

23:07.545 --> 23:09.308
You look beautiful.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.971
What's this? It's really good.

23:12.049 --> 23:14.483
It's ice cream. What are you doing here?

23:14.552 --> 23:16.076
Mother sent me.

23:16.387 --> 23:18.014
Mother sent you?

23:18.256 --> 23:21.350
You'd better come sit down
and tell me what this is all about.

23:21.426 --> 23:22.757
Very well.

23:23.161 --> 23:26.790
Mother says to tell you
that you've spent enough time in America.

23:26.931 --> 23:29.229
You should come home
to Paradise Island...

23:29.300 --> 23:32.360
and start assuming your role
as heiress to the throne.

23:32.470 --> 23:34.404
Mother doesn't understand.

23:34.472 --> 23:37.908
If I don't stay here,
there may not be a Paradise Island.

23:37.975 --> 23:40.705
It will suffer
with the rest of the free world.

23:40.778 --> 23:43.679
Suffer how? What are you talking about?

23:45.049 --> 23:47.108
It's difficult to explain.

23:48.219 --> 23:52.986
The Americans are fighting a war
against a monstrous evil, the Nazis.

23:53.391 --> 23:57.760
If the Nazis win, the whole world
would be subjected to slavery.

23:58.229 --> 24:00.424
I feel that by staying here...

24:00.498 --> 24:04.764
I can help in some small way
towards preventing this catastrophe.

24:05.169 --> 24:06.500
Do you understand?

24:06.571 --> 24:10.132
It's not me you have to convince.
It's Mother.

24:10.374 --> 24:12.342
There's got to be a way.

24:14.045 --> 24:18.141
Dru, if I can show you
how important this is...

24:18.549 --> 24:20.574
will you explain it to Mother?

24:20.651 --> 24:24.610
- Does that mean I can stay?
- Yes, but only for a few days.

24:25.089 --> 24:29.082
Just long enough for me to show you
the justice of the Americans' cause...

24:29.160 --> 24:31.685
as opposed to the evil of the Nazis.

24:31.929 --> 24:33.487
What will I have to do?

24:33.564 --> 24:37.330
Look, listen, and understand.

24:39.737 --> 24:41.068
Very well.

24:42.974 --> 24:46.432
First, there are things
that you must know about me...

24:46.511 --> 24:48.172
so that you don't give me away.

24:48.246 --> 24:50.305
I have two different identities.

24:50.381 --> 24:52.246
You're not just Wonder Woman?

24:52.316 --> 24:56.081
No, I'm also Diana Prince...

24:56.520 --> 24:59.648
Yeoman, United States Navy.

25:04.561 --> 25:06.324
How do you like it?

25:08.098 --> 25:11.590
I don't much like it. You look too dowdy.

25:11.735 --> 25:15.136
Yes, it's a very necessary part of my plan.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.899
It allows me to be
in Military Intelligence...

25:17.974 --> 25:21.239
where I can know immediately
where I'm most needed.

25:21.344 --> 25:22.834
I guess it must help.

25:22.913 --> 25:25.973
Yes, and it also enables me
to stay close to Steve.

25:26.583 --> 25:28.050
Major Trevor.

25:29.119 --> 25:30.643
I work for him.

25:31.121 --> 25:34.284
- You work for a man?
- Yes.

25:35.225 --> 25:38.194
- He tells you what to do and you do it?
- Yes.

25:41.932 --> 25:44.332
What are they like, Diana, men?

25:46.503 --> 25:49.768
They're like children, they're like gods...

25:49.839 --> 25:53.240
they're like geniuses, and fools.

25:54.911 --> 25:56.674
They are all things.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.205
Will I get to meet any?

25:59.282 --> 26:01.944
Yes. As a matter of fact, tonight...

26:02.085 --> 26:05.646
Steve and a brilliant young engineer
are coming here for dinner.

26:06.423 --> 26:10.120
- Can I have ice cream?
- Yes, you can have ice cream.

26:11.962 --> 26:14.487
It's so good to see you, Drusilla.

26:17.300 --> 26:18.927
My little sister.

26:22.706 --> 26:25.539
Okay, we have to get you
some clothes for now.

26:25.609 --> 26:27.167
Tomorrow we'll go shopping...

26:27.243 --> 26:30.076
and we'll have you looking like a teenager
in no time.

26:30.146 --> 26:31.511
What's a teenager?

26:31.581 --> 26:35.608
A teenager is what they call
a young person here in the United States.

26:36.419 --> 26:40.583
While you're changing, tell me
what's happening on Paradise Island.

26:40.690 --> 26:42.123
How is Mother?

26:42.192 --> 26:43.659
- Diana.
- Yes?

26:44.327 --> 26:47.785
Would they really make slaves
of everyone, these Nazis?

26:47.897 --> 26:50.058
Yes, if they're allowed to.

26:51.601 --> 26:54.434
Then you're right.
We must help stop them.

26:56.539 --> 26:58.336
You're so beautiful.

27:04.614 --> 27:06.980
- May I help you?
- Thank you.

27:07.617 --> 27:11.348
This is quite a surprise.
I didn't even know you had a sister, Diana.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.480
- Welcome to Washington, Dru.
- Thank you.

27:13.556 --> 27:15.819
It's a surprise to me, too. A pleasant one.

27:15.891 --> 27:18.985
I have a date when I thought
I was going to be stag tonight.

27:19.061 --> 27:21.894
I shot one of those once
with my crossbow.

27:23.832 --> 27:25.094
You what?

27:26.068 --> 27:29.799
A stag. It was a twelve-pointer.
Diana, you remember when we were...

27:29.872 --> 27:31.533
Honey, what he means is that...

27:31.607 --> 27:35.043
he's so pleased to have such a pretty girl
for company tonight.

27:35.611 --> 27:37.704
- You are?
- Certainly.

27:38.914 --> 27:40.609
Diana, I like men.

27:43.018 --> 27:45.680
- Do you really think I'm pretty?
- Very.

27:46.522 --> 27:47.887
So are you.

27:48.957 --> 27:51.016
- Dru.
- Well, he is.

27:51.326 --> 27:54.625
I especially like the way
his eyes crinkle up in the corner.

27:59.435 --> 28:03.030
Peter, you understand
what I was telling you on the way over?

28:03.105 --> 28:05.801
Yes, I'm still a little stunned by...

28:06.508 --> 28:10.035
That's good planning having
another engine ready and hidden like that.

28:10.612 --> 28:14.605
But just remember, we only have five days
to get another XPJ-1 in the air...

28:14.683 --> 28:16.514
and perform the tests.

28:16.885 --> 28:18.375
Can you do it?

28:20.322 --> 28:22.381
Yes, I think so.

28:23.292 --> 28:25.624
When does the new engine arrive?

28:29.498 --> 28:30.760
Tomorrow.

28:52.387 --> 28:53.445
Yes?

28:55.023 --> 28:57.583
Is that the voice of a good friend?

28:57.926 --> 29:00.861
It depends upon
how good friendship is measured.

29:00.929 --> 29:03.489
It is measured by the strength...

29:03.565 --> 29:06.090
of each one's resolve.

29:30.259 --> 29:32.659
Welcome, Captain Radl. Come in.

29:40.468 --> 29:42.595
I'll be at the docks
to supervise the unloading.

29:42.670 --> 29:46.231
Then I'll accompany it to the airfield
where the new airframe is waiting.

29:46.307 --> 29:49.367
Good. I'll contact Berlin immediately.
They'll be very pleased.

29:49.443 --> 29:51.502
They'd written off the XPJ-1 entirely.

29:51.579 --> 29:54.309
Which is what the Americans wanted.
It nearly worked.

29:54.382 --> 29:56.748
It would have, if it had not been for you.

29:56.818 --> 29:58.809
Now, on to other matters.

30:00.588 --> 30:04.046
This mysterious woman and her bracelets.

30:04.926 --> 30:08.123
This matter has priority
even over the XPJ-1.

30:08.863 --> 30:11.229
It's of incalculable importance.

30:12.133 --> 30:15.068
I was at the airfield. I saw her, remember?

30:15.169 --> 30:17.660
- What can you tell me about her?
- Very little.

30:17.738 --> 30:19.296
I've heard about her, though.

30:19.373 --> 30:21.841
She's supposed to have the strength
of an Amazon.

30:22.043 --> 30:24.477
Perhaps it's the bracelets that interest us.

30:25.413 --> 30:27.404
How can we flush her out?

30:28.082 --> 30:30.642
She's obviously connected
with Military Intelligence.

30:30.718 --> 30:32.083
Steve Trevor's group.

30:32.153 --> 30:34.678
We should concentrate our efforts
in that direction.

30:34.755 --> 30:37.349
- Who's in charge there?
- General Blankenship.

30:37.425 --> 30:40.223
He works out of an office
at the War Department.

30:40.294 --> 30:43.491
I think we should make some plans
for the General.

30:46.834 --> 30:48.631
Drusilla, time to go.

32:07.580 --> 32:08.979
Hi, cupcake.

32:09.950 --> 32:11.281
Yeah, you.

32:11.551 --> 32:14.384
- Where have you been all my life?
- On Paradise Island.

32:14.454 --> 32:17.514
Paradise Island?
Wow, we've got us a fruitcake.

32:18.425 --> 32:21.883
You have a remarkable number
of red spots on your face.

32:24.197 --> 32:25.960
Hey, you want a soda?

32:26.433 --> 32:27.627
A soda?

32:28.702 --> 32:31.432
All right,
I'll spring for a banana split then.

32:31.504 --> 32:33.028
I like bananas.

32:33.940 --> 32:37.239
Do you think I could have some ice cream
with that?

32:38.278 --> 32:39.677
You're neat.

32:43.283 --> 32:46.081
You can't take her over there
dressed like that.

32:46.152 --> 32:48.484
What's the matter
with the way I'm dressed?

32:48.555 --> 32:50.216
Now that's neat.

32:51.024 --> 32:52.651
Coming, hotshot?

32:54.594 --> 32:56.323
Yeah, I guess.

33:16.983 --> 33:20.817
Dru, I don't care,
you shouldn't have left without telling me.

33:20.954 --> 33:22.046
I was worried.

33:22.122 --> 33:25.114
Now where can I meet you?
We're due out at the War Department.

33:25.191 --> 33:28.126
No, I'm not going anywhere
dressed like this.

33:28.862 --> 33:31.194
I wanna buy some clothes first.

33:31.598 --> 33:34.761
I want a skirt and a big, baggy sweater.

33:35.902 --> 33:37.233
All right.

33:37.804 --> 33:41.296
I will pick you up
and then we'll go shopping. Okay?

33:41.641 --> 33:42.630
Neat.

33:54.454 --> 33:57.287
Four copies will do it, Steve.
I'll need them in a hurry.

33:57.357 --> 33:58.381
All right, sir.

33:58.458 --> 34:01.655
I'm sorry we're late.
Dru had some shopping to do.

34:01.828 --> 34:03.819
So this is the young lady, is it?

34:03.897 --> 34:06.559
Drusilla, I'd like for you to meet
General Blankenship.

34:06.633 --> 34:08.726
Of course,
you've already met Major Trevor.

34:08.802 --> 34:11.896
The General is the one who's arranged
a security pass for you...

34:11.971 --> 34:13.268
while you're in Washington.

34:13.339 --> 34:14.704
- How do you do?
- Hello.

34:14.774 --> 34:17.868
Diana, there are some reports
we have to get out right away.

34:17.944 --> 34:19.969
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir.

34:21.347 --> 34:22.335
Now, Dru...

34:22.414 --> 34:24.405
Don't worry about Drusilla.

34:24.483 --> 34:27.007
I have to drive out to Fort Belvoir
for a meeting.

34:27.085 --> 34:28.746
So why doesn't she go with me?

34:28.821 --> 34:31.483
I'll show you George Washington's home
at Mount Vernon.

34:31.556 --> 34:35.014
- It's just a short drive from here.
- Gee, that sounds neat.

34:37.196 --> 34:39.289
I'll take good care of her.

34:39.731 --> 34:41.096
All right.

34:55.447 --> 34:59.349
I understand that,
but why is the Americans' cause just...

34:59.418 --> 35:01.579
and the Nazis' cause unjust?

35:03.021 --> 35:05.922
You ask strange questions
for someone so young, my dear.

35:05.991 --> 35:09.586
It's very important I understand
if I'm to explain it to my mother.

35:09.661 --> 35:11.652
I'm sure she already knows.

35:11.730 --> 35:12.924
No, she doesn't.

35:12.998 --> 35:16.058
That's why Diana asked me
to explain it to her.

35:23.876 --> 35:25.241
Why, that idiot!

35:27.446 --> 35:29.141
What do you think you're doing?

35:29.214 --> 35:31.944
Get in the car, General. I got a gun on you.

35:33.785 --> 35:35.377
- What about the girl?
- Leave her.

35:35.454 --> 35:38.480
- She'll give the alarm.
- That's what it's about.

35:38.590 --> 35:40.820
To the rangers' station. Quick!

35:52.604 --> 35:55.596
What would Diana do
about something like this?

36:05.717 --> 36:07.742
No, I don't know the number.

36:07.819 --> 36:11.619
I just need to speak with someone
of some importance.

36:11.890 --> 36:13.323
At the War Department.

36:13.392 --> 36:16.156
I'd like to speak with
the head of the War Department...

36:16.228 --> 36:17.923
if that's possible.

36:18.430 --> 36:21.228
No, I don't know the number
of the War Department.

36:21.300 --> 36:23.564
Surely you can find it for me?

36:24.403 --> 36:25.768
Yes, ma'am.

36:25.837 --> 36:27.668
I know that there's a war going on.

36:27.739 --> 36:30.230
That's why I want the number
of the War Department.

36:32.244 --> 36:33.541
How rude!

36:33.812 --> 36:35.302
- Trouble?
- Yes.

36:35.380 --> 36:37.678
- I'm dynamite around trouble.
- Really?

36:37.749 --> 36:38.773
Try me.

36:38.850 --> 36:42.251
I need to speak with
the Military Intelligence in Washington.

36:42.321 --> 36:44.720
General Blankenship's
just been kidnapped.

36:44.789 --> 36:47.622
Sure, and President Roosevelt's
a Nazi spy.

36:48.492 --> 36:50.926
I didn't know that. Are you sure?

36:51.596 --> 36:54.030
Let's discuss it over a root beer.

36:54.098 --> 36:56.896
We could listen
to this great new disc I just got...

36:56.968 --> 37:00.404
New guy, knocking them dead.
Sinatra, Fred Sinatra, I think.

37:00.504 --> 37:02.938
I'm sorry. I really don't have time.

37:03.007 --> 37:06.272
But if that Mr. Sinatra
is really knocking people dead...

37:06.344 --> 37:08.972
something should be done about him
right away.

37:09.080 --> 37:11.071
You're a riot. Cute, too.

37:11.282 --> 37:12.613
Thank you.

37:12.883 --> 37:16.944
If you can't help me, I suppose
I'll have to deal with this myself.

37:17.655 --> 37:20.522
Is there some kind of ranger station
around here somewhere?

37:20.591 --> 37:22.559
Sure. Couple of miles up the road.

37:22.627 --> 37:23.958
Thank you.

37:25.396 --> 37:27.728
You sure you don't want a root beer?

37:32.303 --> 37:33.827
Suit yourself.

37:34.538 --> 37:35.732
Weird.

38:07.872 --> 38:11.433
Now that we've got the General,
the girl will raise the alarm.

38:11.509 --> 38:13.841
She's probably done it already.

38:15.746 --> 38:20.080
Then they'll send this Wonder Woman
to rescue the General.

38:21.319 --> 38:25.187
And that's what we will be ready for.
So get rid of your guns.

38:25.389 --> 38:27.186
Get rid of the guns?

38:27.291 --> 38:30.818
They're no use against Wonder Woman.
She is bulletproof.

38:31.462 --> 38:32.895
Come on, you're kidding.

38:32.963 --> 38:36.023
Unfortunately, no.
So get yourself into hiding.

38:37.501 --> 38:39.799
She might be here any time now.

39:14.771 --> 39:16.432
Do it. You do it.

39:18.708 --> 39:21.438
Arms up. Bend here. There.

39:21.511 --> 39:23.138
Now think.

40:51.668 --> 40:54.432
They were right about you, lady.
You're something else.

40:54.504 --> 40:56.699
What have you done
with General Blankenship?

40:56.773 --> 40:58.707
Just used him to flush you out.

41:22.832 --> 41:26.962
Come on, I've got no time for games.
I've got a lot of work to do.

41:27.036 --> 41:29.367
I told you, I'm from Military Intelligence.

41:29.438 --> 41:31.770
Sure. And I'm General MacArthur.

41:34.076 --> 41:35.338
Yes, sir.

41:36.512 --> 41:38.878
A War Department staff car
was found abandoned...

41:38.947 --> 41:40.938
about half a mile from here this afternoon.

41:41.016 --> 41:42.950
Have you seen anything suspicious?

41:43.018 --> 41:45.009
Not a thing. Whose car was it?

41:45.087 --> 41:47.317
It belonged to an Army general.

41:47.389 --> 41:49.949
- You're kidding me.
- You do know something.

41:50.025 --> 41:52.858
She said that General Blankenship
had just been kidnapped.

41:52.928 --> 41:55.123
I didn't believe her. Like, who would?

41:55.197 --> 41:56.164
Who said?

41:56.231 --> 41:58.893
- What did she look like?
- She was a cute little number.

41:58.967 --> 42:01.936
She tried to phone the War Department.
Then she just took off.

42:02.004 --> 42:03.369
Where did she go?

42:03.438 --> 42:04.803
Search me.

42:05.073 --> 42:06.097
Wait a minute.

42:06.174 --> 42:08.665
She did ask if there was a ranger station
near here.

42:08.744 --> 42:11.474
- Is there?
- Sure, couple of miles up the road.

42:11.547 --> 42:12.878
Thanks. Let's go.

42:33.602 --> 42:35.797
General, are you all right?

42:37.139 --> 42:39.403
Just feeling a little foolish.

42:45.213 --> 42:46.942
There you are, sir.

42:47.683 --> 42:49.844
- What did they want with you?
- I don't know.

42:49.918 --> 42:52.580
They didn't even try to get
any information out of me.

42:52.654 --> 42:54.212
Where's Drusilla?

42:54.289 --> 42:57.053
I'm sure she's all right.
They weren't interested in her.

42:57.125 --> 42:59.992
The last I saw her,
she was safe at the side of the road.

43:00.062 --> 43:01.552
Where could she have gone?

43:01.630 --> 43:04.258
She's most surely back
at the apartment, Diana.

43:04.333 --> 43:06.597
Have you any idea
what frightened them off?

43:06.668 --> 43:07.657
None.

43:08.337 --> 43:10.635
There was some kind of fight. I heard that.

43:10.706 --> 43:12.901
After that, nothing, until you showed up.

43:12.975 --> 43:14.806
The main thing is that you're safe.

43:14.876 --> 43:17.037
Would you please take me
back to my apartment?

43:17.112 --> 43:19.603
If Dru isn't there,
perhaps she's left a note.

43:19.681 --> 43:21.171
Of course. Let's go.

43:28.890 --> 43:30.221
Drusilla?

43:57.284 --> 43:58.478
War Department.

43:58.552 --> 44:02.420
General Blankenship's office, please.
Extension 0277.

44:02.690 --> 44:04.419
One moment, please.

44:05.960 --> 44:07.154
Steve?

44:07.561 --> 44:09.051
This is Diana.

44:09.397 --> 44:10.864
Dru's not here.

44:10.931 --> 44:12.421
- No message?
- No message.

44:12.500 --> 44:15.867
Look, Diana, I know you're worried.
I'm worried, too.

44:16.037 --> 44:18.062
But maybe she's just
gone out somewhere.

44:18.139 --> 44:21.040
You said yourself she was fascinated
by life in Washington.

44:23.444 --> 44:26.641
Thank you very much, Steve.
You're probably right.

44:26.914 --> 44:29.075
I'll see you in the morning.

45:03.918 --> 45:05.044
She's still out.

45:05.119 --> 45:08.384
That chloroform worked just like
you said it would.

45:11.525 --> 45:12.685
Funny.

45:13.627 --> 45:16.187
She looks younger than I remember...

45:17.798 --> 45:19.993
and I thought she was bigger.

45:20.501 --> 45:22.059
It is her, isn't it?

45:22.136 --> 45:25.230
Yes, I'm sure of it.
There can't be two Wonder Women.

45:25.306 --> 45:27.331
I'm going to contact Berlin.

45:29.143 --> 45:33.580
It's just a short while before we find out
the secret of those bracelets.

45:39.987 --> 45:41.716
And there's no doubt?

45:41.789 --> 45:44.019
Not according to Captain Radl.

45:44.658 --> 45:46.558
That is not good enough.

45:46.861 --> 45:49.694
Before I commit troops to this venture...

45:49.764 --> 45:52.324
I want to have positive proof
that Radl's prisoner...

45:52.399 --> 45:55.129
is indeed this Wonder Woman.

45:58.739 --> 46:01.139
There's one sure way to find out.

46:04.445 --> 46:08.381
This is Berlin's idea.
I should have thought of it myself.

46:09.016 --> 46:11.041
You're going to shoot her.

46:12.119 --> 46:13.915
What if you're wrong?

46:14.354 --> 46:17.187
Then we will know
we have the wrong woman.

46:22.428 --> 46:24.020
Unlock the door.

46:24.931 --> 46:27.263
Remember she's very strong and quick.

46:27.333 --> 46:29.324
I can handle it. The door.

46:42.315 --> 46:43.714
Who are you?

46:44.050 --> 46:46.610
Captain Radl at your service, fräulein.

46:47.053 --> 46:48.543
You're a Nazi.

46:49.189 --> 46:50.520
Yes, I am.

46:51.291 --> 46:54.419
Where am I? What do you want with me?

46:54.494 --> 46:56.018
Come, fräulein.

46:58.031 --> 47:00.693
What would you imagine
we'd want of Wonder Woman?

47:00.767 --> 47:01.961
I'm...

47:02.669 --> 47:04.159
I don't know.

47:06.372 --> 47:09.432
But whatever it is,
you're not going to get it.

47:09.509 --> 47:11.340
We'll see about that.

47:12.412 --> 47:16.075
But first, we must find a way
to make sure...

47:16.149 --> 47:19.084
that your powers are really
that formidable.

47:21.221 --> 47:23.018
You're very mistaken.

47:23.256 --> 47:26.580
For your sake, I hope not.

48:26.784 --> 48:29.762
