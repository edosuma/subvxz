I would like to close the show today
with a truly inspirational tale.

00:13.200 --> 00:16.800
One year ago,
a very successful friend of mine

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
was struck by tragedy.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.600
Prognosis: Not good. Hope: Slim.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.100
But armed with only fortitude,
this friend of mine fought back.

00:31.500 --> 00:35.500
I'm talking about the reopening of
Seattle's finest restaurant, Chez Henri.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.500
Just goes to show you

00:37.800 --> 00:42.300
that a four-alarm fire
is no match for five-star courage.

00:43.500 --> 00:47.600
This is Frasier Crane saying good day
and good mental health.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.000
You still don't have a table
for opening night.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.800
And it's killing me.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.400
Okay, everyone, it's showtime.

00:54.700 --> 00:57.300
The new station owner's
on his way down. So look alive.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.300
Watch what you say,
watch what you don't say.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.400
Don't say too much,
don't say too little.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.700
What the hell's this thermostat
set at anyway?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.300
Good Lord. Kenny, calm down.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.100
We've done the new-owner drill
a million times.

01:09.500 --> 01:10.400
What'll it be today, Roz?

01:10.600 --> 01:13.000
The glad-handing sycophant,
or our salute to teamwork?

01:13.300 --> 01:14.600
Yeah, yeah, very funny.

01:14.900 --> 01:17.500
Come on, Kenny. You know
how these people come and go.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.600
They introduce themselves,
they shake your hand,

01:19.900 --> 01:21.700
tell us they're big fans
and then they're gone.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.800
Nothing every changes.
So don't worry about it.

01:24.100 --> 01:26.300
Well, that's easy for you to say.
You've got a contract.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.900
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hello, sir.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.600
Ah, Clark Bar. Excellent choice, sir.

01:33.300 --> 01:34.600
You must be the new owner.

01:34.900 --> 01:37.100
Hi, I'm Frasier Crane
and this is my producer, Roz Doyle.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.900
- Hi.
- Hey, Todd Peterson.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.900
Mr. Peterson's one of
the brightest stars of Silicon Valley.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.800
- Thank you.
- And he's one of the youngest

01:44.100 --> 01:45.300
members of the Fortune 500.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.700
- Please, you're embarrassing me.
- And he's a big fan of your show.

01:49.100 --> 01:52.800
Oh, now you're embarrassing me.
Ha-ha. Go on.

01:53.100 --> 01:55.200
It's true.
I've been listening since college.

01:55.500 --> 01:58.600
I love the theme weeks,
but I was really into Follow-Up Fridays,

01:58.900 --> 02:01.800
when you had previous callers call in
to let you know how they're doing.

02:02.100 --> 02:06.200
- Why did you stop doing that?
- Oh, well, it wasn't my idea.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.100
You know, Todd,
seeing as how you are such a big fan,

02:15.500 --> 02:17.200
perhaps I could bend your ear
sometime

02:17.300 --> 02:19.100
about a few ideas I have
for the show.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.600
Great. I'd love to hear them.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.900
Really?
Well, how about later today, perhaps?

02:23.100 --> 02:24.800
Over cocktails at my place?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.600
- That would be cool.
- Cool indeed.

02:27.900 --> 02:28.900
- Later.
- Right.

02:29.100 --> 02:32.800
And may I say it's truly an honour
to be serving under your leadership.

02:33.200 --> 02:37.500
This is a great day for KACL,
indeed for radio itself.

02:39.100 --> 02:41.100
I see you decided
to skip glad-handing sycophant

02:41.400 --> 02:43.500
and go straight
for bootlicking kiss ass.

[MARTIN MOANS]

02:49.800 --> 02:52.600
- Is that too much?
- Oh, no, it feels great, Daph.

02:52.900 --> 02:55.700
Got a lot of elbow grease there
today.

02:55.900 --> 02:57.700
I suppose I'm a bit wound up.

02:57.900 --> 03:00.500
Niles is out with Mel.
I don't trust that woman.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.200
MARTIN:
Oh, come on.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.700
He's not with her
because he wants to be.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.500
He's just gonna give her
what she wants

03:06.600 --> 03:08.000
so she'll give him the divorce.

03:08.300 --> 03:10.400
He's crazy about you, you know that.

03:10.600 --> 03:14.300
I know. And I'm crazy about him.

03:17.300 --> 03:21.000
Still, Niles has been gone
for a long time.

It's open.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.600
- Hello.
- Niles.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.400
Sorry I'm late. Mel picked
a restaurant on the other side of town.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.800
I'm getting so tired
of that woman's antics.

03:33.100 --> 03:35.500
Antics, that's what
they are. Oh!

03:37.700 --> 03:39.100
This whole charade,

03:39.300 --> 03:42.100
making you pretend
you're a happy couple, it's so unfair.

03:42.300 --> 03:46.200
It's criminal. She won't even allow you
to be seen in public together.

03:47.700 --> 03:48.800
Did you hear that?

03:49.000 --> 03:51.900
Give it up, old man.
The massage is over.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.000
Daphne, I know it's difficult,

03:54.200 --> 03:56.900
but once she gives me that divorce,
we can go anywhere we want.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.700

04:00.000 --> 04:02.200
How about my room to fold laundry?

I hear it's lovely this time of year.

04:07.100 --> 04:09.400
Oh, uh, Dad, listen, you know,

04:09.600 --> 04:12.400
I've got some company coming over,
so if you don't mind...

04:12.600 --> 04:14.600
Oh, hot date, huh?

04:14.900 --> 04:17.100
Well, actually, Dad,
the new station owner's coming by

04:17.300 --> 04:19.100
to hear some ideas I have
about my show.

04:19.399 --> 04:21.399
Well, it's a woman at least, right?

04:21.700 --> 04:23.900
Whatever gets you
out of the room faster, Dad.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

04:29.400 --> 04:31.600
- Todd, come on in.
- Hi, Frasier.

04:32.200 --> 04:35.600
- Whoa. Sweet view.
- Thank you, thank you.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.500
That's the Space Needle there,
of course, and Elliott Bay.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.700
And actually, on a clear day,
you can see Mount Rainier.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.900
TODD:
Epic.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.200
Is that a Pizza Hut?

04:47.400 --> 04:50.500
- Well, we did start a petition...
- Well, it must've worked.

04:50.700 --> 04:52.400
That is a Pizza Hut.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.500
- You've got a great place here, Fras.
- Oh, thank you.

04:56.900 --> 04:58.000
I like this.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.700
What, did your kid carve it in camp?

05:00.900 --> 05:03.700
Actually, that's a fertility god
from Central Africa.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.800
It's quite rare. Thank you.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.500
Say, Todd,
can I interest you in a sherry?

05:09.800 --> 05:11.400
No, it would be wasted on me.

05:11.700 --> 05:13.900
I don't know the first thing
about that stuff.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.300
In the great scheme of things,
it's not very important.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.400
It kind of is. I mean, ever since
my search engine went public,

05:19.700 --> 05:23.000
people have been inviting me
to fundraisers and banquets.

05:23.300 --> 05:28.300
They expect me to know all sorts
of things about art and music, wine.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.200
I don't know jack. It's embarrassing.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.900
- I'm sure you're exaggerating.
- No.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.200
I spent my whole life
in front of a computer.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.800
I don't know Beethoven from...

05:43.600 --> 05:46.000
Beethoven's the only one I know.

05:47.600 --> 05:51.200
You know,
it's never too late to learn.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.800
- I'd be glad to give you some pointers.
- Really?

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
I'd be delighted.
I will play Virgil to your Dante.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.200
In a few weeks, I guarantee you,
you will find that delightfully droll.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.100
- Say, how about that sherry?
- Oh, yeah.

06:09.400 --> 06:14.600
All right, then. Which you should know
is a fortified wine.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.900
Oh, wow.
Frasier, you really know your stuff.

06:18.200 --> 06:23.800
Look at these. Great paintings,
cool furniture, African sex toys.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.900
This is how I should be living.

- How much you want for the place?
- Excuse me?

Name your price.

No, Niles, I didn't.

to shed his fraternity house ways.

that if we end things now,

- No, not quite.

No, well,
it didn't go exactly as I expected.

11:52.900 --> 11:54.200
At intermission, I got my drink

11:54.400 --> 11:55.900
and waited for someone
to approach Mel.

11:56.100 --> 11:57.200
And finally someone did.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.800
Founders' Circle stalwart
Ace Lemieux.

12:00.100 --> 12:03.600
I coiled, panther-like, ready
to fling my drink on his shirt front,

12:03.800 --> 12:08.200
when I noticed he was wearing that
wool crepe hand-tailored tuxedo of his.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.400
Well, you know, l...

12:10.700 --> 12:14.400
I couldn't raise my hand
against such a magnificent garment.

12:14.800 --> 12:18.700
Niles, that tux is a blend
and you know it.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.600
Yes, yes, of course I know it.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.800
Frasier, I just couldn't do it.

12:25.100 --> 12:27.400
That kind of loutish behaviour,
it's just not in my nature.

12:27.700 --> 12:29.900
Of course, Niles.
That goes without saying.

12:30.200 --> 12:33.600
Just remember
for whom you're doing all this.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.600
Believe me, Daphne is the only thing

12:35.900 --> 12:37.600
that is keeping me going
through all of this.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.100
Tonight I'm supposed to meet Mel
for dinner at Chez Henri

12:41.300 --> 12:44.400
and make an ass of myself
in front of her society friends.

12:44.700 --> 12:46.900
Oh, Lord. Chez Henri.

12:47.200 --> 12:53.100
Their menu is just the culinary
minefield to test Todd's mettle.

12:53.500 --> 12:56.600
Oh, your young protégé.
How's that coming along?

12:57.300 --> 12:59.200
Actually, things have taken
a bit of an odd turn.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.100
You see, yesterday,
I went to his housewarming party.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.700
As it turns out, to my surprise...

13:06.000 --> 13:10.200
...he has duplicated
my apartment exactly.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.800
Exactly?

13:12.600 --> 13:15.400
The only thing missing
is an old man and a little dog.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.600
I was beside myself.

13:18.900 --> 13:21.300
Well, of course you were.
I assume you read him the riot act.

13:21.600 --> 13:26.300
Well, he is my boss.
He has big plans for my show.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.500
Do I really wanna jeopardise that?

13:29.500 --> 13:31.700
There's Todd now.
Uh, Todd, over here.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.100
I'd like you to meet my brother,
Niles Crane.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.200
- Niles, this is Todd Peterson.
NILES: Hello.

13:36.500 --> 13:40.600
Oh, and may I say,
what a lovely outfit.

13:40.900 --> 13:43.100
Hope you got the volume discount.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.400
Guess who's officially hooked
on classics?

13:48.700 --> 13:52.100
Oh, well, good for you.
Good for you.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.900
Now, Todd, I'd like to talk to you
about your apartment.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.100
- You don't like it.
- No, no, I do like it.

13:58.300 --> 14:02.000
- I've liked it for eight years.
- So, what's the problem?

14:02.400 --> 14:06.300
Well, I was hoping that my influence
would help you to find your own style,

14:06.600 --> 14:10.800
not that you would simply
duplicate mine.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.800
What am I doing?

14:15.100 --> 14:16.900
I'm in way over my head here...
Let's admit it.

14:17.100 --> 14:18.800
- With all this culture stuff.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.900
I should just stick to what I know,
computers. I'm a computer guy.

14:22.200 --> 14:25.000
No, Todd, you know, perhaps we just
took on a bit too much too soon.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.600
I need to move back to San Jose,

14:26.800 --> 14:28.600
sell the apartment,
sell the radio station...

14:28.800 --> 14:31.700
Steady at the wheel, Todd.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.700
Now, listen.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
All we're really talking about is a couple
of couches and some coffee tables.

14:38.300 --> 14:40.200
But you said we shouldn't have
the same apartment.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.100
Yes, and we shouldn't.

14:43.500 --> 14:46.100
But perhaps I'm being too hasty

14:46.500 --> 14:50.100
about which of us
should be doing the changing.

14:50.900 --> 14:54.700
Perhaps I'm holding on too tight
to my possessions.

14:55.100 --> 14:58.000
Décor is, after all, a fluid art.

14:58.300 --> 15:00.900
- Should I be writing this down?
- No, no, Todd, no.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.800
Listen, Todd.

15:02.900 --> 15:05.600
I want you to keep the apartment
the way it is.

15:05.900 --> 15:09.100
After all, it's a look
that has served me well,

15:09.400 --> 15:11.100
but it's time that I move on.

15:12.100 --> 15:15.500
- Thank you, Frasier.
- No, thank you, Todd.

15:15.900 --> 15:17.900
Hey, you wanna come see
my new car?

15:18.200 --> 15:20.100
I have a feeling you're gonna like it.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.600
I have a feeling I will.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Niles, you have been behaving
like a perfect gentleman all night.

15:31.300 --> 15:34.100
Now, cut it out,
and do something offensive.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.400
I don't know at which table
you've been sitting.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.800
Did you not just see me
unapologetically take the last roll?

15:40.100 --> 15:42.400
I need more than that
and you know it.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.500
Now, my friends are giving you
plenty to work with.

15:45.700 --> 15:47.600
Andrew has been drinking like a fish,

15:47.800 --> 15:51.000
and Margaret is wearing
that revolting dress again.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.900
Yow. I'm glad you're on my side.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.100
I can do this.

15:56.500 --> 15:59.000
- Sorry, everyone.
- Sorry, sorry.

15:59.300 --> 16:03.900
Oh, you newlyweds.
Just can't be apart for one second.

16:04.300 --> 16:07.300
Oh, the bill. Well, we're not finished.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.200
We still have wine.
Would anyone like a refill?

16:10.400 --> 16:12.200
I'm a little dry.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.600
[CLEARS THROAT]

16:13.800 --> 16:17.900
Dry?
I know that's not your liver speaking.

16:21.100 --> 16:24.900
Niles, we just discussed
you were not going to bring that up.

16:25.300 --> 16:29.500
Well, I did, so there.
And I'll say it again.

16:29.900 --> 16:33.600
You're probably seeing two of me,
so you might as well hear me twice.

16:35.200 --> 16:38.600
You, sir, are a complete drunk.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.600
- Niles, how could you...?
- Well...

16:43.700 --> 16:45.400
How could you know?

16:46.800 --> 16:49.200
I thought I was hiding it so well.

16:51.400 --> 16:54.100
I have a problem. It's time I face it.

16:54.800 --> 16:58.500
I've been meaning to say something,
but I didn't have the courage.

16:58.900 --> 17:02.800
Not like Niles.
You're a good person.

17:04.599 --> 17:07.099
I'm getting help first thing tomorrow.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.599
I'm so sorry, baby.

17:10.900 --> 17:13.400
Thank you
for giving me my husband back.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.800
Mel, darling, you married an angel.

17:20.099 --> 17:22.200
Don't I know it.

17:28.700 --> 17:32.500
Ah. Dad, what do you think
of the new look?

17:33.100 --> 17:37.500
Nice stuff.
You really tied the flow to the motif.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.700
Thanks for trying.

17:41.700 --> 17:43.600
- Well, shall we give it a test run?
- Yeah.

Dad.

18:42.900 --> 18:45.000
Looks great, son.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.500
- There's nothing here.
- I know.

18:51.100 --> 18:54.600
I give up.
I've tried a million combinations.

18:55.500 --> 19:00.400
I even had early Byzantine
mingling with mid-century Danish.

19:00.900 --> 19:03.800
Will they ever get along?

19:04.000 --> 19:07.600
The only furniture that looks good
in my apartment is my own.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Well, I could have told you that
three love seats ago.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.900
So what are you waiting for?
Go bring it back.

19:16.900 --> 19:19.000
Well, I'm glad I went
to three different stores

19:19.200 --> 19:21.100
to find your organic furniture polish.

19:21.400 --> 19:24.000
Well, Daphne, chin up. You can
always use it to polish the floors.

19:24.200 --> 19:28.300
Oh, yes. When God closes a door,
he opens a window.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.200
You know, Dad,
even if I do get my furniture back,

19:32.400 --> 19:33.700
it doesn't solve anything.

19:33.900 --> 19:37.400
There's still someone downstairs
with my apartment.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.100
That's not your apartment.
This is your apartment.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.700
And if every stooge
in the building rips you off,

19:43.000 --> 19:46.200
it doesn't take anything away from you,
because you were the original.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.100
I am, aren't I?

19:55.200 --> 19:57.100
And I did, after all, create that look,

19:57.300 --> 19:59.300
and that should be
gratification enough.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.600
Good for you, son.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.100
He doesn't have very many friends.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.200
The only person who's ever gonna see
that apartment

20:08.500 --> 20:10.900
is probably the Pizza Hut
delivery boy.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.000
- Todd, come on in.
- Hey, Fras.

20:15.300 --> 20:18.300
I just need to know the name
of the chick who made our couch.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.100
Oh, right. It's a reproduction
of the one Coco Chanel had

20:22.400 --> 20:25.100
in her Paris atelier. But why?

20:25.300 --> 20:27.500

wants to know.
