00:58.126 --> 00:59.609
(<i>honks horn</i>)

00:59.709 --> 01:03.775
âª And my sister says I've got
to see it and believe it... âª

01:03.875 --> 01:06.276
PRUE:
<i>She's gonna choose you.</i>

01:06.376 --> 01:06.984
Is not.

01:07.084 --> 01:08.609
You get to hang out
with her a lot more.

01:08.709 --> 01:10.442
You've known her longer--
I mean, there was

01:10.542 --> 01:12.775
that whole bonding time
before I was even born.

01:12.875 --> 01:15.817
Okay, she was one
and I was three--

01:15.917 --> 01:19.151
what did we bond over,
diapers and drooling?

01:19.251 --> 01:20.151
What are those?
They're glasses

01:20.251 --> 01:22.650
so we can watch the eclipse.
They're very cool.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.359
I made you a pair, too.
Yay!

01:25.459 --> 01:26.499
Thank you.

01:27.709 --> 01:31.026
Oh, good, you're home.
Hey.

01:31.126 --> 01:32.859
So, um...
We were
sort of

01:32.959 --> 01:35.567
hoping that you could
settle something for us.

01:35.667 --> 01:39.376
Sure. Anything to get my mind
off weddings.

01:40.542 --> 01:41.399
What?

01:41.499 --> 01:44.234
Nothing.
No, come on, what?

01:44.334 --> 01:45.399
Okay, uh, well,

01:45.499 --> 01:48.399
we were kind of wondering
who you were gonna have

01:48.499 --> 01:49.859
as your maid of honor.

01:49.959 --> 01:51.734
Oh. Well,
let me think about it.

01:51.834 --> 01:56.399
I'm... not allowed to invite
anybody or have a cake

01:56.499 --> 01:57.609
or a band

01:57.709 --> 01:58.942
or flowers,

01:59.042 --> 01:59.620
so what makes you think

01:59.630 --> 02:01.483
I'll be able to <i>have
</i> a maid of honor?

02:01.583 --> 02:03.692
Oh, honey,
it's not that bad.

02:03.792 --> 02:05.525
It's not like I'm
some girly-girl

02:05.625 --> 02:07.859
who wants, like, a
fairy tale wedding,

02:07.959 --> 02:10.942
but I just thought there
would be some things

02:11.042 --> 02:12.567
that would be givens.

02:12.667 --> 02:13.901
Like fighting
with the caterer

02:14.001 --> 02:17.026
and agonizing over
who makes the final cut
on the guest list?

02:17.126 --> 02:22.399
Even those, I just...
I just want to be able
to celebrate a little.

02:22.499 --> 02:25.192
All right, maybe you're not
getting your dream wedding,

02:25.292 --> 02:27.151
but you are getting
your dream guy.

02:27.251 --> 02:30.042
(<i>sighs</i>)

02:32.499 --> 02:33.442
Leo!

02:33.542 --> 02:34.399
Shh!

02:34.499 --> 02:35.859
(<i>whispers</i>):
Leo!

02:35.959 --> 02:38.525
I hate to be
the bearer of bad news.

02:38.625 --> 02:41.399
Could you possibly be
the bearer of a big hug?

02:41.499 --> 02:43.318
Not after
what I just...

02:43.418 --> 02:44.399
found out.

02:44.499 --> 02:47.399
They want
an answer, Piper,

02:47.499 --> 02:47.901
about us.

02:48.001 --> 02:52.151
Either there isn't any us,
or you guys get a new lighter.

02:52.251 --> 02:54.399
We have till tomorrow night
to decide.

02:54.499 --> 02:56.276
Tomorrow night?
That's insane.

02:56.376 --> 02:58.359
Look, there is, uh,
door number three.

02:58.459 --> 03:00.567
We can try and pull this off
by tomorrow night, and if we do,

03:00.667 --> 03:03.026
it's binding,
and they can't even
break that apart.

03:03.126 --> 03:06.026
Yeah, but if they find out,
they can break <i>us</i> apart

03:06.126 --> 03:08.026
into a thousand little pieces.

03:08.126 --> 03:09.359
Excuse me?

03:09.459 --> 03:11.901
I believe the term
he used was

03:12.001 --> 03:15.276
"unspeakable wrath, the likes of
which you can't even imagine."

03:15.376 --> 03:16.609
LEO:
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.

03:16.709 --> 03:18.400
We would be taking
a huge risk.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.650
And until
they get an answer,

03:19.750 --> 03:21.609
they are gonna be
listening very closely.

03:21.709 --> 03:25.775
So any talk of <i>it
</i> to any use of the "W" word...

03:25.875 --> 03:27.192
PRUE:
I hate to be the detail police

03:27.292 --> 03:30.151
but, I mean, how are we
gonna hide it from them

03:30.251 --> 03:31.399
when we're on
their, like,

03:31.499 --> 03:32.442
their supernatural redial?

03:32.542 --> 03:34.359
They're always
gonna be tuning in.

03:34.459 --> 03:35.859
Phoebe, did you
find anything

03:35.959 --> 03:37.399
in <i>The Book of Shadows</i>

03:37.499 --> 03:38.650
about how to
hide this?
No, nothing.

03:38.750 --> 03:41.399
I'm sorry, I'm still on the
"unspeakable wrath" part.

03:41.499 --> 03:43.318
I mean, is that just
the bride and groom,

03:43.418 --> 03:45.276
or does it also
include bridesmaids?

03:45.376 --> 03:46.817
Phoebe.
What?

03:46.917 --> 03:49.026
I mean, there must be
some real reason

03:49.126 --> 03:51.109
that this merging
is so forbidden.

03:51.209 --> 03:52.692
They are hard-core
against it.

03:52.792 --> 03:54.984
Yeah, well,
rules are meant to be broken.

03:55.084 --> 03:56.650
Yeah, but bodies weren't.

03:56.750 --> 03:59.334
And neither were hearts.

04:00.126 --> 04:01.399
Leo, are you sure
there's a way

04:01.499 --> 04:03.483
we can do this without
getting caught?

04:03.583 --> 04:06.442
If there is,
we'll find it.

04:06.542 --> 04:07.901
Just be extra careful.

04:08.001 --> 04:10.026
Speak in code,
and especially avoid

04:10.126 --> 04:12.734
using words like, you know...

04:12.834 --> 04:13.399
Hm?

04:13.499 --> 04:15.399
(<i>hums "Wedding March"</i>)

04:15.499 --> 04:16.399
Mm-hmm.

04:16.499 --> 04:18.418
Right. You should go.

04:18.583 --> 04:22.442
The less time you spend
here is probably better.

04:22.542 --> 04:27.399
And we probably shouldn't
do that, either.

04:27.499 --> 04:29.276
Soon.

04:29.376 --> 04:31.667
Yeah.

04:33.750 --> 04:36.775
Why are <i>they</i> so hell-bent

04:36.875 --> 04:40.026
on seeing each one of us
so very, very alone?

04:40.126 --> 04:41.567
(<i>groans</i>)

04:41.667 --> 04:45.750
(<i>meowing, hissing,
squeaking in distance</i>)
Kit?

04:46.583 --> 04:48.483
(<i>meowing</i>)
(<i>squeaking</i>)

04:48.583 --> 04:51.359
(<i>Kit snarling</i>)
Kit! Leave that alone!

04:51.459 --> 04:52.399
Bad kitty!

04:52.499 --> 04:53.692
(<i>meows</i>)

04:53.792 --> 04:55.500
(<i>squeaks</i>)

05:02.209 --> 05:03.859
(<i>gasps</i>)
Good, kitty.

05:03.959 --> 05:06.084
(<i>Kit meows</i>)

06:10.999 --> 06:13.899
So, are you afraid of me?
No, are you planning

06:13.999 --> 06:16.818
on sprouting horns,
growing fangs and eating us?

06:16.918 --> 06:18.899
If you work for him,
I'll do worse than that.

06:18.999 --> 06:20.859
Which "him"
are you referring to?

06:20.959 --> 06:21.651
PIPER:
Okay, hi.

06:21.751 --> 06:24.150
Not that I don't enjoy
the verbal ping-pong here,

06:24.250 --> 06:25.734
but we do have that other thing

06:25.834 --> 06:27.025
we need to figure out
kind of quickly,

06:27.125 --> 06:28.234
so let's cut
to the chase.

06:28.334 --> 06:30.109
Are we helping
or fighting?

06:30.209 --> 06:31.734
What you saw happen to me
didn't scare you?

06:31.834 --> 06:33.401
If I had a dollar
for every time an owl

06:33.501 --> 06:36.484
turned into a hot guy
on our porch, I'd be r-r...

06:36.584 --> 06:37.526
We've seen worse.

06:37.626 --> 06:38.401
PRUE:
If you're not here

06:38.501 --> 06:41.192
to kill us, apparently,
we're supposed to help you.

06:41.292 --> 06:44.417
The only help you can give
is allowing me to leave.

06:49.584 --> 06:51.275
(<i>low growling</i>)

06:51.375 --> 06:52.899
PRUE:
I think it's pretty obvious,

06:52.999 --> 06:55.025
don't you,
that we're pretty familiar

06:55.125 --> 06:56.192
with the world of magic.

06:56.292 --> 06:58.234
We're sort of
on the same team here.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.150
Look, the last thing
I need in my life

07:00.250 --> 07:01.234
right now is more magic.

07:01.334 --> 07:02.359
I don't think
you understand.

07:02.459 --> 07:03.734
No, you're right,
I don't understand.

07:03.834 --> 07:05.899
Because I stopped understanding
when he cursed me

07:05.999 --> 07:06.899
and took my life away from me.

07:06.999 --> 07:09.109
The only thing
I do understand is loss,

07:09.209 --> 07:11.567
and the only thing I want
is revenge.

07:11.667 --> 07:12.818
Who did this to you?

07:12.918 --> 07:14.692
Was it a magician,
a sorcerer?

07:14.792 --> 07:15.567
He was my boss.

07:15.667 --> 07:16.489
PRUE:
If you could just give us

07:16.589 --> 07:19.900
some time, I'm sure
we could figure out...
I lost enough time already

07:20.000 --> 07:21.401
when your cat dragged me here.

07:21.501 --> 07:22.859
Look, I only have
12 hours,

07:22.959 --> 07:25.899
and tomorrow at sunrise,
I am airborne again.

07:25.999 --> 07:26.899
I won't-- no, I...

07:26.999 --> 07:28.900
I <i>can't...</i> last another day

07:29.000 --> 07:31.109
repeating the same cycle.

07:31.209 --> 07:32.025
Tonight this thing ends.

07:32.125 --> 07:35.859
His life, and I hope the curse
that goes along with it.

07:35.959 --> 07:38.899
Just give us
30 seconds, please.

07:38.999 --> 07:39.899
It starts now.

07:39.999 --> 07:43.983
Okay, there are some
of my boyfriend's
clothes over there.

07:44.083 --> 07:47.150
Why don't you dress
while we huddle.

07:47.250 --> 07:50.983
Well, he definitely has
that whole tortured-
innocent thing going on.

07:51.083 --> 07:52.150
Yeah, but we're kind of

07:52.250 --> 07:53.025
busy and, uh, he doesn't seem

07:53.125 --> 07:55.567
to want our help.
PRUE:
Been there, saved that.

07:55.667 --> 07:56.567
It wouldn't be the first time.

07:56.667 --> 07:59.526
All right, you get ready
just in case he decides to bolt.

07:59.626 --> 08:01.709
All right,
here's what we're gonna...

08:02.792 --> 08:03.359
PIPER:
Oh.

08:03.459 --> 08:04.942
Well, he's gone.
That's too bad.

08:05.042 --> 08:07.899
(<i>scoffs</i>):
Piper, we can't just
ignore this.

08:07.999 --> 08:09.401
He was brought to
us for a reason.

08:09.501 --> 08:13.109
Yes, but we have to find a way
to hide the w-w-w-

08:13.209 --> 08:14.567
w-w-w...

08:14.667 --> 08:15.999
rutabaga...

08:16.292 --> 08:17.734
...before they catch on.

08:17.834 --> 08:18.899
The rutabaga?

08:18.999 --> 08:20.567
It's a code word
for the thing

08:20.667 --> 08:23.375
we're not supposed
to talk about.

08:23.792 --> 08:24.900
(<i>hums
"Wedding March"</i>)

08:25.000 --> 08:26.899
(<i>hums loudly</i>)

08:26.999 --> 08:29.899
Oh. The rutabaga.
Yes.

08:29.999 --> 08:31.734
So let's do the
divide-and-conquer thing, okay?

08:31.834 --> 08:34.150
Great.
PRUE:
I'll look in <i>The Book of Shadows</i>

08:34.250 --> 08:35.859
and try and scry
with this owl feather.

08:35.958 --> 08:37.609
You guys see what
you can come up with

08:37.708 --> 08:39.234
for Piper's rutabaga.

08:39.333 --> 08:42.899
Uh, maybe I should stay here
and help you?

08:42.999 --> 08:43.982
Phoebe, Piper needs your help

08:44.082 --> 08:45.983
just as much as
the innocent does,
maybe more.

08:46.083 --> 08:49.109
I'm fully aware
that we're supposed to
protect the innocent.

08:49.209 --> 08:50.899
These are the rules
that we live by now.

08:50.999 --> 08:54.792
I'm just not so sure
we should be helping
Piper break them.

08:58.999 --> 09:00.651
I don't get it,
if our ancient compilation

09:00.751 --> 09:02.899
of spells, witchcraft
and rituals can't help us,

09:02.999 --> 09:04.651
what makes you think
Martha Stewart can?

09:04.751 --> 09:07.109
You know what I don't get,
is why you're giving me

09:07.209 --> 09:08.234
such a hard time
about this.

09:08.334 --> 09:10.942
Weren't you the same
girl that was pushing
me to say yes?

09:11.042 --> 09:12.692
If you didn't think
I should have

09:12.792 --> 09:15.734
a rutabaga, then you
should have said so, maybe,

09:15.834 --> 09:19.859
like, a long
time ago.
Ding-ding.
Back to your corners.

09:19.959 --> 09:20.776
Hi.

09:20.876 --> 09:23.150
Phoebe. And...?

09:23.250 --> 09:24.067
Uh...

09:24.167 --> 09:25.776
Piper.
Piper.

09:25.876 --> 09:26.567
Right.

09:26.667 --> 09:27.999
Mm-hmm.

09:28.459 --> 09:29.651
Assistant district attorney,

09:29.751 --> 09:30.818
we have to stop meeting
like this.

09:30.918 --> 09:33.983
You better be careful-- a guy
might think he's being followed.

09:34.083 --> 09:35.899
<i>You</i> better
be careful,

09:35.999 --> 09:38.025
or a girl might think
her sister's getting

09:38.125 --> 09:41.401
a really cheesy
pickup line.

09:41.501 --> 09:43.899
Um... so, what brings you

09:43.999 --> 09:44.734
all the way
across town?

09:44.834 --> 09:48.359
I needed some source material
on a forensic psychology case.

09:48.459 --> 09:51.442
Oh, well, I can see you're
making a lot of progress.

09:51.542 --> 09:52.442
Yeah.

09:52.542 --> 09:54.067
(<i>Phoebe laughing</i>)

09:54.167 --> 09:55.942
Here's the info
on forensic psychology

09:56.042 --> 09:56.704
you requested.
Thanks.

09:56.714 --> 10:00.317
Oh-ho, embarrassed,
party of one.
!
Next customer, please.

10:00.417 --> 10:03.000
No. (<i>laughing</i>)

10:05.459 --> 10:06.317
COLE:
So who's

10:06.417 --> 10:07.899
the lucky guy?
Or, more importantly,

10:07.999 --> 10:11.025
who's the
lucky sister?
Me.

10:11.125 --> 10:11.899
Me.

10:11.999 --> 10:13.150
Me... Mimi.

10:13.250 --> 10:15.150
Our cousin.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.401
Our cousin Mimi.

10:17.501 --> 10:21.067
Good old cousin Mimi.
(<i>chuckles</i>)

10:21.167 --> 10:22.317
Love her.

10:22.417 --> 10:25.442
Well, I should
probably get going.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.526
I've sort of
got plans

10:26.626 --> 10:28.983
to accidentally bump
into another eyewitness

10:29.083 --> 10:30.983
over at the Gas 'n Sip's.

10:31.083 --> 10:33.692
(<i>laughs</i>):
Cute.

10:33.792 --> 10:35.359
I get cuter.

10:35.459 --> 10:38.083
We go now.

10:40.417 --> 10:43.192
(<i>sighs</i>):
Got to go.

10:43.292 --> 10:46.083
(<i>chuckles</i>)

11:01.709 --> 11:02.899
We made another
killing today.

11:02.999 --> 11:07.109
When you told the traders
to buy at 54 and a quarter

11:07.209 --> 11:08.899
they were a little sketchy.

11:08.999 --> 11:13.526
30 minutes later,
everybody's rich, and
they're worshipping you

11:13.626 --> 11:14.999
like a god.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.651
Magic does take a bit
of the risk out of
playing the market.

11:20.751 --> 11:23.109
Unfortunately,
not all my risks

11:23.209 --> 11:25.899
have paid out like
they were supposed to.

11:25.999 --> 11:28.584
You've heard it, too?

11:29.167 --> 11:32.275
That screech.

11:32.375 --> 11:33.899
It reeks of despair.

11:33.999 --> 11:35.359
He's near, circling.

11:35.459 --> 11:37.899
He longs for her like I do.

11:37.999 --> 11:40.983
Well, give it time.

11:41.083 --> 11:43.234
I sought the magic
so I wouldn't have to.

11:43.334 --> 11:44.025
It has been two months--

11:44.125 --> 11:46.999
the curse should have
broken them by now!

11:50.999 --> 11:52.401
(<i>heavy sigh</i>)

11:52.501 --> 11:56.942
All this means nothing
if I can't have what I want.

11:57.042 --> 11:59.667
And I want her.

12:01.584 --> 12:03.667
Dismissed.

12:07.918 --> 12:11.109
I am gonna cut out your heart
like you cut out mine!

12:11.209 --> 12:12.150
<i>Christopher...
</i> I'm impressed.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.942
In our time apart,
you've gone and
discovered courage.

12:15.042 --> 12:16.109
Would you like
to borrow some?

12:16.209 --> 12:19.317
No, thanks, I'm
trying to cut down.

12:19.417 --> 12:21.359
I have to say,
I'm a bit surprised

12:21.459 --> 12:24.234
to see you've managed
to come so close.

12:24.334 --> 12:27.025
Note to self:
chat with security.

12:27.125 --> 12:29.899
Well, a bird's-eye view gives
a man a different perspective,

12:29.999 --> 12:33.818
different strategies.
Ah... yes, the curse.

12:33.918 --> 12:34.776
So, tell me,

12:34.876 --> 12:36.899
does absence make
the heart grow fonder?

12:36.999 --> 12:37.484
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

12:37.584 --> 12:39.983
Do you really think
that killing me will
ease your pain?

12:40.083 --> 12:43.651
All that will do
is ensure that the
curse lasts forever.

12:43.751 --> 12:45.918
You rang?

12:46.999 --> 12:48.150
What's it gonna be, Chris?

12:48.250 --> 12:48.983
You've got the wrong plan.

12:49.083 --> 12:51.859
The only way
your curse ends
ends is if she

12:51.959 --> 12:53.401
gives herself to me.

12:53.501 --> 12:54.442
But, ah,

12:54.542 --> 12:55.359
is he telling the truth?

12:55.459 --> 12:57.567
I'll let you in
on a little secret:

12:57.667 --> 12:59.067
I never bluff,

12:59.167 --> 13:02.083
and he rarely misses.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.150
Find him
and kill him.

13:08.250 --> 13:13.999
And if you haven't by sunrise,
kill every owl you see!

13:14.834 --> 13:17.609
Hey, I hope you guys had
better luck than I did.

13:17.709 --> 13:18.401
PIPER:
Not really.

13:18.501 --> 13:20.275
I ended up with
the wrong books.

13:20.375 --> 13:20.900
And, uh...

13:21.000 --> 13:22.899
well, Phoebe, almost got lucky

13:22.999 --> 13:24.067
right there in the store.

13:24.167 --> 13:26.651
Ha, ha.
So you didn't find anything?

13:26.751 --> 13:27.942
No, it's just
that the pieces

13:28.042 --> 13:29.484
don't really seem
to fit, you know.

13:29.584 --> 13:32.859
I mean, I can understand cursing
someone to be an animal,

13:32.959 --> 13:34.234
but why for only half
of the day?

13:34.334 --> 13:35.983
And we don't know
where he went, right?

13:36.083 --> 13:39.192
PRUE:
No, I tried scrying
with the owl feather,

13:39.292 --> 13:41.959
but it must not work
while he's human.

13:42.667 --> 13:43.818
I found something.

13:43.918 --> 13:45.150
On the curse?

13:45.250 --> 13:48.526
Uh, no, about the, um...

13:48.626 --> 13:49.999
rutabaga.

13:50.792 --> 13:55.584
It's a ritual that's like a
rutabaga but it's called, um...

14:06.042 --> 14:06.899
Oh yeah, that handf...

14:06.999 --> 14:08.942
BOTH:
Shh! Shh!

14:09.042 --> 14:09.899
PIPER:
The reason we write

14:09.999 --> 14:13.526
the bad words is so that we
don't say the bad words.

14:13.626 --> 14:15.067
Wait a minute,
I thought

14:15.167 --> 14:16.067
you said you looked in the book

14:16.167 --> 14:18.109
and couldn't find anything
to help me?

14:18.209 --> 14:18.818
Uh, yeah,

14:18.918 --> 14:21.899
well, it said that we needed
a high priestess

14:21.999 --> 14:23.025
and since we don't

14:23.125 --> 14:24.442
have one of those,

14:24.542 --> 14:25.942
I just sort of figured

14:26.042 --> 14:26.899
why even mention it.

14:26.999 --> 14:29.734
Besides, I couldn't find
anything in there

14:29.834 --> 14:31.234
about how to hide it from them

14:31.334 --> 14:35.401
and since that's really
the most important part,

14:35.501 --> 14:39.876
so that we don't have
to feel the, um...

14:44.167 --> 14:45.651
I think you can say
those words.

14:45.751 --> 14:47.275
Uh, I was hoping
writing them down

14:47.375 --> 14:48.983
would help us
remember them.

14:49.083 --> 14:50.234
Um...

14:50.334 --> 14:51.192
I'm just worried

14:51.292 --> 14:56.442
that if you go through with it,
it's going to be too dangerous

14:56.542 --> 14:57.734
and that maybe,

14:57.834 --> 14:58.484
um...

14:58.584 --> 15:01.442
This is really hard
for me to say,

15:01.542 --> 15:06.234
but, uh, maybe you're being
a little selfish?

15:06.334 --> 15:07.192
Selfish?

15:07.292 --> 15:08.899
Yeah, because what if
your rutabaga

15:08.999 --> 15:09.983
keeps us from doing our job?

15:10.083 --> 15:11.899
Keeps us from saving
innocent people?

15:11.999 --> 15:14.983
I mean what
happens then?

15:15.083 --> 15:17.401
Uh, yeah, but what about me?

15:17.501 --> 15:18.067
I mean,

15:18.167 --> 15:23.150
maybe you're right,
maybe I am being selfish,

15:23.250 --> 15:25.734
but what's wrong with that?

15:25.834 --> 15:28.192
I mean, when do we get to do
something for ourselves?

15:28.292 --> 15:32.818
Haven't you ever wondered that,
or wanted that?

15:32.918 --> 15:33.454
Yeah, absolutely,

15:33.464 --> 15:36.899
but not at the expense
of hurting other people,

15:36.999 --> 15:37.899
or each other.

15:37.999 --> 15:38.899
PIPER:
Is that what

15:38.999 --> 15:40.899
you're afraid of, getting hurt?

15:40.999 --> 15:41.899
No, Piper, I'm afraid

15:41.999 --> 15:44.859
that you're <i>not</i> afraid
of getting hurt.

15:44.959 --> 15:47.942
I've been through more pain in
the past two years

15:48.042 --> 15:48.899
than you can imagine,

15:48.999 --> 15:51.150
and this is the only way
to stop that.

15:51.250 --> 15:55.109
Now I'd like to do
the right thing,

15:55.209 --> 15:57.359
but...

15:57.459 --> 16:00.167
I also want to be with him.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.626
(<i>gasps</i>)

16:10.999 --> 16:12.459
(<i>snarling</i>)

16:14.459 --> 16:15.567
PRUE:
What is it?

16:15.667 --> 16:16.609
Our innocent.

16:16.709 --> 16:17.275
And I think

16:17.375 --> 16:22.609
he was being attacked
by a coyote or a wolf.

16:22.709 --> 16:24.567
(<i>wolf howling</i>)

16:24.667 --> 16:27.234
PHOEBE:
All right, wait a minute.

16:27.334 --> 16:31.899
I think that this looks
like the place, sort of.

16:31.999 --> 16:32.734
That's funny,

16:32.834 --> 16:34.234
I remember it looking like

16:34.334 --> 16:35.776
the right place sort of

16:35.876 --> 16:36.245
three hours ago!

16:36.255 --> 16:39.567
Okay look, if you wanted
a supernatural LoJack

16:39.667 --> 16:41.859
you came to the wrong witch.

16:41.959 --> 16:42.983
Oh.

16:43.083 --> 16:44.899
Wait, look.

16:44.999 --> 16:46.899
That is where Christopher
was standing

16:46.999 --> 16:48.109
in my premonition.

16:48.209 --> 16:49.275
PIPER:
Uh-huh.

16:49.375 --> 16:52.359
(<i>wolf growling</i>)

16:52.459 --> 16:54.234
Shh, shh, shh.

16:54.334 --> 16:55.792
What was that?

16:56.501 --> 16:58.401
There he is.

16:58.501 --> 17:00.375
Hey!

17:01.999 --> 17:03.834
(<i>screaming</i>)

17:05.291 --> 17:08.192
No!
PHOEBE:
Okay, Piper, hurry up,

17:08.291 --> 17:09.275
freeze him.

17:09.375 --> 17:09.746
Wait.

17:09.756 --> 17:12.942
We don't have much time my love.
Someone's coming.

17:13.041 --> 17:14.999
He's not attacking him.

17:47.918 --> 17:49.834
(<i>screeching</i>)

18:09.751 --> 18:11.734
Wait.

18:11.834 --> 18:14.609
Christopher wanted us
to talk to you.

18:14.709 --> 18:15.067
He does?

18:15.167 --> 18:18.317
I'm vamping. It's the only way
to get her to stop.

18:18.417 --> 18:19.899
Look, we met him
last night.

18:19.999 --> 18:20.899
Right before he went

18:20.999 --> 18:21.899
after the sorcerer.

18:21.999 --> 18:24.484
We tried to stop him,
but without your help--

18:24.584 --> 18:26.317
he'll do it again.

18:26.417 --> 18:29.567
And we both know what will
happen if he does.

18:29.667 --> 18:31.334
He'll die.

18:33.083 --> 18:36.900
How do I know that you
aren't working for him?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.818
You don't.

18:38.918 --> 18:39.983
You guys can't
do it alone.

18:40.083 --> 18:42.942
So you're just going
to have to trust us.

18:43.042 --> 18:44.359
Trust is earned.

18:44.459 --> 18:45.484
Okay, I hate to
break up the whole

18:45.584 --> 18:46.899
getting-to-know-you
portion of the program,

18:46.999 --> 18:50.999
but what did Christopher mean
when he said someone was coming?

18:51.876 --> 18:53.401
BROOKE:
If Christopher
went after him,

18:53.501 --> 18:55.692
then he must have sent
someone after us.

18:55.792 --> 18:56.899
Why?

18:56.999 --> 19:00.109
Because he fell in love with me.

19:00.209 --> 19:01.983
This... this curse

19:02.083 --> 19:05.651
is my punishment for not
returning that love.

19:05.751 --> 19:07.359
So woman by day

19:07.459 --> 19:08.999
and wolf by night?

19:10.250 --> 19:12.999
(<i>owl screeching</i>)

19:14.999 --> 19:15.942
He's warning me.

19:16.042 --> 19:17.025
We have to go.

19:17.125 --> 19:18.192
PIPER:
Huh?

19:18.292 --> 19:20.250
All right.

19:22.918 --> 19:24.000
(<i>gasps</i>)

19:27.584 --> 19:28.899
Where is he?

19:28.999 --> 19:30.999
That's the least
of your problems.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.899
Have we earned
your trust yet?

19:38.999 --> 19:40.459
Come on.

19:42.209 --> 19:46.609
I swear to God I've seen
this in a movie somewhere.

19:46.709 --> 19:47.567
Uh, Pheebs?

19:47.667 --> 19:48.651
Upstairs,
<i>Book of Shadows,</i>

19:48.751 --> 19:50.150
curse search,
way ahead of you.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.942
Okay, you and I are going
to go to the kitchen.

19:53.042 --> 19:54.899
I'm fine really, let me help.

19:54.999 --> 19:56.899
Look, you are
tired and hungry.

19:56.999 --> 20:00.359
Please, just let me help.

20:00.459 --> 20:01.959
All right.

20:03.292 --> 20:05.192
Want to take
a Wiccan time out

20:05.292 --> 20:07.459
and do the crossword puzzle?

20:07.834 --> 20:13.150
Piper, uh, about what
I said before--

20:13.250 --> 20:14.609
I didn't mean for...

20:14.709 --> 20:15.484
Yes, you did.

20:15.584 --> 20:19.250
You never say anything
you don't mean.

20:21.999 --> 20:22.942
You keep saying

20:23.042 --> 20:25.442
that it isn't like
what you'd imagined.

20:25.542 --> 20:26.651
And I do understand

20:26.751 --> 20:27.120
your side of it.

20:27.130 --> 20:32.234
I mean, I have never seen anyone
look at you the way Leo does,

20:32.334 --> 20:35.442
and that is beautiful,
and you deserve that,

20:35.542 --> 20:37.025
but I still...

20:37.125 --> 20:38.067
I, um...

20:38.167 --> 20:42.584
I can't say that it's right.

20:43.876 --> 20:44.899
And I wish

20:44.999 --> 20:45.818
that I were wrong.

20:45.918 --> 20:49.167
And it's important
that you know that.

20:54.584 --> 20:56.942
The problem is you're not.

20:57.042 --> 21:00.442
There's truth to it--
to what you said.

21:00.542 --> 21:02.859
I can't deny that.

21:02.959 --> 21:08.899
So, unless both Prue
and you approve it,

21:08.999 --> 21:11.125
I won't go through with it.

21:16.417 --> 21:19.501
(<i>sighs</i>)

21:24.542 --> 21:27.899
We used to leave
each other notes.

21:27.999 --> 21:30.567
When this...

21:30.667 --> 21:32.692
when this first happened,

21:32.792 --> 21:34.942
I'd find them at sunrise
and I'd know,

21:35.042 --> 21:38.459
I'd remember all the reasons
I loved him.

21:40.959 --> 21:42.609
And then...

21:42.709 --> 21:45.292
The letters stopped.

21:48.292 --> 21:50.192
There's a limit
you know,

21:50.292 --> 21:53.150
To how much
any person can take.

21:53.250 --> 21:54.567
I keep wondering.

21:54.667 --> 21:56.501
(<i>owl screeching</i>)

22:02.584 --> 22:04.692
You keep asking yourself...

22:04.792 --> 22:07.292
Shouldn't love
conquer all?

22:11.042 --> 22:12.401
You know this isn't fair.

22:12.501 --> 22:13.899
I mean it's hard enough
to find somebody

22:13.999 --> 22:15.900
that you can spend
the rest of your life with,

22:16.000 --> 22:19.899
but when you constantly
have magic meddling,

22:19.999 --> 22:21.150
I am so sick of it.

22:21.250 --> 22:22.900
I mean I've been
through it,

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
you're going through it
and now Brooke.

22:26.999 --> 22:29.359
What love can't conquer,
we will.

22:29.459 --> 22:32.109
For everybody but ourselves.

22:32.209 --> 22:33.999
Honey...

22:34.918 --> 22:36.959
the day's not over yet.

22:38.501 --> 22:39.317
(<i>clearing throat</i>)

22:39.417 --> 22:40.983
We're going to need
your help

22:41.083 --> 22:42.442
if you want this to end

22:42.542 --> 22:44.150
happily ever after.

22:44.250 --> 22:46.584
I know I could use
a happy ending.

22:54.999 --> 22:57.250
Do you come bearing gifts?

22:58.459 --> 22:59.899
I come bearing victory.

22:59.999 --> 23:03.401
That's an awfully small bag
for awfully large prey.

23:03.501 --> 23:04.899
If you killed
the right bird,

23:04.999 --> 23:08.234
we'd be looking at a dead human
bleeding on my floor right now.

23:08.334 --> 23:09.776
You're foolish...

23:09.876 --> 23:10.651
or deceitful.

23:10.751 --> 23:12.609
Either way, you failed.

23:12.709 --> 23:13.651
He had help.

23:13.751 --> 23:14.526
From whom?

23:14.626 --> 23:16.025
A pigeon perhaps?

23:16.125 --> 23:19.734
Maybe a penguin to the rescue?

23:19.834 --> 23:20.484
Witches!

23:20.584 --> 23:21.317
And now they're with her.

23:21.417 --> 23:23.899
But their choice in company
is not relevant.

23:23.999 --> 23:25.942
The fact that
he still lives

23:26.042 --> 23:27.899
is!

23:27.999 --> 23:29.899
I wanted blood on my hands.

23:29.999 --> 23:30.776
I don't have his

23:30.876 --> 23:33.275
so I guess I'll have
to take yours.

23:33.375 --> 23:35.292
(<i>screaming</i>)

23:38.292 --> 23:41.834
(<i>voice echoing</i>):
Clean up, aisle 2.

23:44.709 --> 23:45.484
Congratulations.

23:45.584 --> 23:47.999
You've just been promoted.

24:03.667 --> 24:05.025
(<i>hoots</i>)

24:05.125 --> 24:06.401
I took a job.

24:06.501 --> 24:07.899
It was an established firm

24:07.999 --> 24:11.234
with a reputation for
promoting from within.

24:11.334 --> 24:13.983
My boss was
this odd man.

24:14.083 --> 24:16.567
I'd worked for
nightmares before,

24:16.667 --> 24:18.150
but nothing
like this.

24:18.250 --> 24:21.442
He made moves.

24:21.542 --> 24:24.942
I made things clear.

24:25.042 --> 24:26.609
He made me this.

24:26.709 --> 24:28.899
To keep you away
from Christopher?

24:28.999 --> 24:31.442
He said, if he couldn't have me,
no one would.

24:31.542 --> 24:34.918
Until there was a night
within a day...

24:35.959 --> 24:37.999
or until I give in.

24:39.209 --> 24:40.109
I never
thought...

24:40.209 --> 24:43.584
Magic was for kids' parties.
It wasn't real.

24:44.999 --> 24:45.942
I didn't know.

24:46.042 --> 24:49.651
We're still kind of getting used
to it ourselves.

24:49.751 --> 24:54.401
But this... this is my fault.

24:54.501 --> 24:56.818
No. You said yes to a job,
not to a man.

24:56.918 --> 24:59.899
But Christopher is being
punished because of me.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.526
I did this
to him.

25:02.626 --> 25:03.999
That's not what he said.

25:05.751 --> 25:06.899
He doesn't

25:06.999 --> 25:08.999
blame you for anything.

25:09.999 --> 25:11.442
And he said..

25:11.542 --> 25:13.999
How strong you are.

25:16.417 --> 25:17.751
He said that?

25:18.584 --> 25:19.776
He said
that it's

25:19.876 --> 25:22.359
your strength that
he first fell in love with.

25:22.459 --> 25:23.067
And he just needs

25:23.167 --> 25:25.999
to know that you're not going
to give that up.

25:27.501 --> 25:28.999
(<i>screeching</i>)

25:30.751 --> 25:32.109
Anything. Anything!

25:32.209 --> 25:34.899
I curse you. You curse me.

25:34.999 --> 25:40.209
Let's get together
and do a little cursing.

25:40.918 --> 25:42.959
Whoa!

25:45.626 --> 25:46.609
Okay. All right.

25:46.709 --> 25:48.818
You know, I specifically
asked for a...

25:48.918 --> 25:50.609
WOMAN:
You asked for an answer.

25:50.709 --> 25:52.275
There it is.

25:52.375 --> 25:53.900
I know that voice.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.776
Well, I should hope so.

25:55.876 --> 25:58.359
Yours came through
loud and clear, so...

25:58.459 --> 25:59.942
here I am.

26:00.042 --> 26:01.484
Grams!

26:01.584 --> 26:04.609
Oh... I would
hug you but...

26:04.709 --> 26:05.609
I know.

26:05.709 --> 26:06.899
It's just good to be here.

26:06.999 --> 26:10.484
Yeah. And not that
I'm not thrilled by that fact,

26:10.584 --> 26:12.899
but a little fuzzy
on the why.

26:12.999 --> 26:13.942
You need
guidance.

26:14.042 --> 26:16.899
Some advice on
a certain sister
situation?

26:16.999 --> 26:17.942
Am I getting warm?

26:18.042 --> 26:19.692
Red hot. But wait a minute.

26:19.792 --> 26:22.484
If you know,
that means that they know.

26:22.584 --> 26:24.899
And if they know, we are f...

26:24.999 --> 26:26.609
Fine.

26:26.709 --> 26:27.567
Anyway,

26:27.667 --> 26:28.899
I'm beyond them now.

26:28.999 --> 26:30.359
Secret's safe with me.

26:30.459 --> 26:32.401
But what about you, Phoebe?

26:32.501 --> 26:33.899
Do you want to tell me

26:33.999 --> 26:35.899
about that nagging concern

26:35.999 --> 26:37.275
you have
in your gut?

26:37.375 --> 26:38.359
That's no fair.

26:38.459 --> 26:40.025
You have afterlife advantage.

26:40.125 --> 26:41.359
I also know you, Phoebe.

26:41.459 --> 26:43.250
Talk to me.

26:45.209 --> 26:46.899
Okay.

26:46.999 --> 26:49.442
Um...

26:49.542 --> 26:52.899
I want to be able
to support Piper in this.

26:52.999 --> 26:54.150
I want
to look at her,

26:54.250 --> 26:57.899
and I want to say go for it.
But...

26:57.999 --> 26:59.899
what if her
and Leo get

26:59.999 --> 27:01.899
rutabaga... ed,

27:01.999 --> 27:03.609
and they find out?

27:03.709 --> 27:05.609
And then something horrible
happens to them?

27:05.709 --> 27:09.442
I mean, look at what happened
to Mom and her special friend.

27:09.542 --> 27:11.401
And, I hate
to go skipping

27:11.501 --> 27:12.359
down Selfish Road,

27:12.459 --> 27:15.899
but what if, by association...

27:15.999 --> 27:17.609
You or Prue get hurt?

27:17.709 --> 27:19.192
Yeah.

27:19.292 --> 27:21.234
I want to be
supportive
to her, Grams--

27:21.334 --> 27:23.651
I really do--
but everything in my heart

27:23.751 --> 27:25.401
is telling me that it's wrong.

27:25.501 --> 27:26.150
All valid
points.

27:26.250 --> 27:30.192
But logic and reason go out the
window when love gets involved.

27:30.292 --> 27:31.401
Yes. I know that, but...

27:31.501 --> 27:32.401
GRAMS:
The Charmed Ones

27:32.501 --> 27:33.899
are destined for greatness,

27:33.999 --> 27:36.484
but that fact doesn't
keep a girl warm

27:36.584 --> 27:38.192
on a cold winter's night.

27:38.292 --> 27:39.067
So, add a blanket.

27:39.167 --> 27:41.192
Grams, I can't believe
you're saying this.

27:41.292 --> 27:42.526
I'm saying
what I know.

27:42.626 --> 27:45.442
I remember the loneliness
all too well.

27:45.542 --> 27:46.899
You were married four times.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.983
Well, that's because
I never found true love,

27:50.083 --> 27:51.859
but maybe Piper has.

27:51.959 --> 27:52.899
And when
the time

27:52.999 --> 27:55.734
comes for them
to make it official,

27:55.834 --> 27:57.401
they'll feel it.

27:57.501 --> 27:59.999
(<i>whispers</i>):
They'll know.

28:02.834 --> 28:03.526
PIPER:
Phoebe?!

28:03.626 --> 28:06.417
Coming!

28:07.751 --> 28:10.125

28:21.459 --> 28:23.067
Phoebes, a little help
here, please?

28:23.167 --> 28:24.459
Okay.

28:25.542 --> 28:25.900
Ooh!

28:26.000 --> 28:27.818
Aah! Okay.

Now the question is,

28:30.292 --> 28:31.150
why didn't he?

28:31.250 --> 28:32.818
Because I don't want <i>you.</i>

28:32.918 --> 28:34.150
I want

He's gonna
be all right.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.401
I know that's the right thing
for you to say,

29:17.501 --> 29:19.484
but you don't know that.

29:19.584 --> 29:22.709
Now all I can do
is watch him die.

29:23.709 --> 29:25.899
No, we can do a lot more
than that.

29:25.999 --> 29:27.192
You know I can't, not now.

29:27.292 --> 29:28.192
Not while they're watching.

29:28.292 --> 29:30.692
Piper, this has absolutely
nothing to do with us,

29:30.792 --> 29:33.167
and everything
to do with an innocent.

about the bad guys.

Uh, the vanquishing talk
caught their ears,

29:47.083 --> 29:48.484
not the other thing.

29:48.584 --> 29:50.983
Leo's a healer.

29:55.417 --> 29:58.526
Well, we can't take him
to the vet.

29:58.626 --> 30:01.250
He's not exactly an animal.

we have to wait.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.959
It was there.

That sounded much better
in my head.

(<i>laughs</i>)

They gave you our books,

30:42.999 --> 30:44.651
and you thought
you'd drop them by.

30:44.751 --> 30:46.734

when you said it.

Of course you do.

Okay.

30:57.999 --> 30:59.776
Um, actually, uh,

30:59.876 --> 31:00.609
you know,

31:00.709 --> 31:04.150
my sisters sort of
got into it today,

31:04.250 --> 31:06.317
so the place is a disaster,

31:06.417 --> 31:07.734
looks like a bomb went off,
you know.

31:07.834 --> 31:10.484
So, if you don't mind
just waiting here,

31:10.584 --> 31:12.709

PIPER:
Leo,

32:48.792 --> 32:49.792
wait!

32:52.542 --> 32:54.609
Leo...

32:54.709 --> 32:55.818
wait!

32:55.918 --> 32:56.692
You can't do that.

32:56.792 --> 32:58.899
You cannot come
into the end of
a conversation

32:58.999 --> 33:00.818
and assume that
you know everything.

33:00.918 --> 33:01.818
All right, let's pretend

33:01.918 --> 33:03.192
that I don't
know anything then,

33:03.292 --> 33:04.359
and explain it to me.

33:04.459 --> 33:06.234
I wasn't questioning you.

33:06.334 --> 33:08.899
I was questioning our decision.

33:08.999 --> 33:10.899
Then ask <i>me</i> your questions.

33:10.999 --> 33:12.899
Don't you think I would like to?

33:12.999 --> 33:13.818
Honestly,

33:13.918 --> 33:16.292
I don't know
what you're thinking.

33:16.876 --> 33:18.651
Well, what I'm thinking is,

33:18.751 --> 33:19.942
maybe Phoebe is right.

33:20.042 --> 33:21.776
Maybe we're being selfish.

33:21.876 --> 33:22.776
Our decision

33:22.876 --> 33:23.899
affects other people.

33:23.999 --> 33:25.692
Other people
that I happen to love.

33:25.792 --> 33:26.899
LEO:
I love them

33:26.999 --> 33:28.776
too, Piper.
I know.

33:28.876 --> 33:29.818
I know that.

33:29.918 --> 33:31.067
Look, you are the last person

33:31.167 --> 33:33.609
I want to be fighting with
right now.

33:33.709 --> 33:34.983
Then let's stop.

33:35.083 --> 33:37.234
Leo, if we get...

33:37.334 --> 33:38.899
If you and...

33:38.999 --> 33:40.651
Okay, let me try that again.

33:40.751 --> 33:44.401
Brooke and Christopher
love each other very much.

33:44.501 --> 33:46.899
But in the end,
that didn't matter.

33:46.999 --> 33:49.776
We haven't reached the end yet.

33:49.876 --> 33:50.942
Have a little faith.

33:51.042 --> 33:53.025
Look, don't you think
this scares me, too?

33:53.125 --> 33:55.651
Don't you think
that I have <i>my</i> doubts?

33:55.751 --> 33:56.484
Do you?

33:56.584 --> 33:57.192
Of course, I do.

33:57.292 --> 33:58.899
What-What I'm trying to say is,

33:58.999 --> 34:00.567
I know
what Christopher must feel.

34:00.667 --> 34:03.109
You know, al-always
worried about the timing,

34:03.209 --> 34:04.651
about how he has
to live his life.

34:04.751 --> 34:07.692
Knowing what his true feelings
are, but unable to share those

34:07.792 --> 34:10.458
with the one person
that he has them for.

34:11.918 --> 34:13.400
She knows.

34:13.501 --> 34:15.400
But it doesn't fix everything.

34:15.501 --> 34:17.998
PHOEBE:
You've got
to give it a chance.

34:18.751 --> 34:20.818
Logic and reason
go out the window

34:20.918 --> 34:22.899
when love gets involved.

34:22.998 --> 34:24.818
Wait a minute, I thought

34:24.918 --> 34:25.525
you said that...

34:25.626 --> 34:27.734
Yeah, well,
I got a long-distance call

34:27.833 --> 34:28.900
with some really good advice.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.899
But we still
haven't figured out
how to pull it off.

34:31.998 --> 34:34.250
When the time's right,
you'll know.

34:37.042 --> 34:39.583
(<i>crying</i>)

34:41.501 --> 34:43.918
I'm sorry.

34:44.417 --> 34:46.899
I'm sorry, I can't let you die.

34:46.998 --> 34:49.417
Please forgive me.

34:51.792 --> 34:52.942
(<i>squawks</i>)

34:53.042 --> 34:55.583
Please forgive me.

34:59.209 --> 35:00.776
PIPER:
That's, uh...

35:00.876 --> 35:03.275
quite a turnaround
for you, sis.

35:03.375 --> 35:05.818
Who's your
new confidante?

35:05.918 --> 35:06.776
Huh?

35:06.876 --> 35:07.899
I think she means

35:07.999 --> 35:09.859
your advice giver?

35:09.959 --> 35:10.900
Uh, it was just...

35:11.000 --> 35:11.442
Oh, my God!

35:11.542 --> 35:14.651
Nice try Phoebes,
but the distraction technique

35:14.751 --> 35:16.651
stopped working
in third grade.

35:16.751 --> 35:17.942
No, it's not a technique.

35:18.042 --> 35:19.317
It's an eclipse. Look at it.

35:19.417 --> 35:20.651
No, wait!

35:20.751 --> 35:22.234
Don't look at it.

35:22.334 --> 35:22.899
Trust me.

35:22.999 --> 35:27.275
I totally forgot that
the eclipse was to... day.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.651
"A night within a day."

35:29.751 --> 35:31.484
I'm sorry, please repeat?

35:31.584 --> 35:32.150
The curse.

35:32.250 --> 35:35.442
The eclipse.
"Until a night within a day."

35:35.542 --> 35:37.459
Isn't that what
Brooke said?

35:37.999 --> 35:38.776
(<i>cry of pain</i>)

35:38.876 --> 35:40.900
That's what's gonna
break the curse.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.567
Prue! It's happening.

35:42.667 --> 35:45.999
(<i>gasping</i>)

35:48.459 --> 35:49.899
Leo, it just happened.

35:49.999 --> 35:50.609
Please help him.

35:50.709 --> 35:52.818
This proves
the theory.

35:52.918 --> 35:54.209
It's the eclipse.

35:54.667 --> 35:56.192
Whoa, you're not
going anywhere.

35:56.292 --> 35:57.567
Brooke...

35:57.667 --> 35:58.734
Look, just rest, okay?

35:58.834 --> 36:00.150
We'll tell her while we...

36:00.250 --> 36:01.651
You can't. She's gone.

36:01.751 --> 36:02.818
What do you mean
she's gone?

36:02.918 --> 36:04.651
She was in the
kitchen when I left.

36:04.751 --> 36:06.317
She's gone to him, hasn't she?

36:06.417 --> 36:07.484
All right.

36:07.584 --> 36:10.083
We'll handle it
while Leo works on you.

36:24.918 --> 36:26.109
Thank you.

36:26.209 --> 36:27.734
PIPER:
I don't understand.

36:27.834 --> 36:29.025
Why would
Brooke go to him?

36:29.125 --> 36:31.776
She didn't trust that you
would be able to save me,

36:31.876 --> 36:33.067
but she knows that she can.

36:33.167 --> 36:34.192
How?
The curse.

36:34.292 --> 36:36.942
If at any time she agrees
to be with him,

36:37.042 --> 36:38.942
and seals that pledge
with a kiss...

36:39.042 --> 36:40.359
She'll be forever bound.

36:40.459 --> 36:43.818
PHOEBE:
But the eclipse changes that.

36:43.918 --> 36:46.125
Yeah, but she doesn't know that.

36:46.709 --> 36:49.150
If he's off the radar,
then he's more than failed,

36:49.250 --> 36:51.734
which leaves the space open
for one of you to fill,

36:51.834 --> 36:56.959
and you do that
by killing the owl!

36:57.501 --> 37:00.876
I was hoping
you would take me instead.

37:09.959 --> 37:11.899
BROOKE:
<i>Aren't you going to kiss me?</i>

37:11.999 --> 37:16.899
Brooke, I may be
cheap but I'm not easy.

37:16.999 --> 37:18.275
No, wait.

37:18.375 --> 37:19.999
Yes, I am.

37:21.250 --> 37:24.983
You're only doing this
to save him, aren't you?

37:25.083 --> 37:26.025
That's okay.

37:26.125 --> 37:28.401
It's quite obvious.

37:28.501 --> 37:29.899
You know what?

37:29.999 --> 37:32.359
I don't care.

37:32.459 --> 37:34.709
You'll grow to love me.

37:36.501 --> 37:38.401
I have your assurance
that Christopher

37:38.501 --> 37:39.899
will not be
harmed again?

37:39.999 --> 37:40.899
You have my love.

37:40.999 --> 37:42.709
Isn't that enough?

37:46.959 --> 37:48.667
(<i>buzz of conversation</i>)

37:52.042 --> 37:53.899
T minus and counting.

37:53.999 --> 37:55.359
And we get to break

37:55.459 --> 37:55.899
into Attica.

37:55.999 --> 37:58.109
PHOEBE:
Well, we do have other choices.

37:58.209 --> 38:00.150
We can climb the roof
or see if there's

38:00.250 --> 38:01.899
a convenient
and unguarded side entrance,

38:01.999 --> 38:05.609
or we could
use the Wonder Twin powers.

38:05.709 --> 38:06.900
Whoa.

38:07.000 --> 38:07.899
Oof.

38:07.999 --> 38:09.442
I don't feel so...

38:09.542 --> 38:10.150
What is it?

38:10.250 --> 38:11.275
I don't know, I don't have

38:11.375 --> 38:13.042
a good feeling about this.

38:13.999 --> 38:14.983
Wait a minute.

38:15.083 --> 38:15.899
I take that back.

38:15.999 --> 38:20.000
I do have a good feeling about
it, about... something.

38:20.542 --> 38:22.942
I feel all warm and... fuzzy.

38:23.042 --> 38:23.983
Is it your stomach?

38:24.083 --> 38:26.484
No. It's, it's...

38:26.584 --> 38:27.999
...here.

38:29.584 --> 38:33.234
"When the time is right,
you'll know..." Oh, my God.

38:33.334 --> 38:34.567
The time is right.

38:34.667 --> 38:35.120
The time for what?

38:35.130 --> 38:38.609
The, uh... the wed...
the... rutabaga...

38:38.709 --> 38:39.859
It's gotta be
the eclipse.

38:39.959 --> 38:42.609
If we can't look up,
that must mean

38:42.709 --> 38:43.899
that they can't look down.

38:43.999 --> 38:46.192
Oh! Oh! Oh. Ooh.

38:46.292 --> 38:47.150
This is it.

38:47.250 --> 38:47.899
This is it. Okay,

38:47.999 --> 38:50.692
all we have to do is,
uh, get home and...

38:50.792 --> 38:52.651
And do the ritual
and let Leo know

38:52.751 --> 38:55.067
and call the florist
and we gotta d-d...

38:55.167 --> 38:56.899
What's... what?

38:56.999 --> 38:58.526
We've gotta get to Brooke.

38:58.626 --> 39:00.109
PHOEBE:
Right, we've gotta get

39:00.209 --> 39:01.317
to Brooke, and then

39:01.417 --> 39:02.567
we gotta get home.

39:02.667 --> 39:03.234
PIPER:
No,

39:03.334 --> 39:05.692
we only have time for one.

39:05.792 --> 39:07.150
So we either save Brooke...

39:07.250 --> 39:08.317
CHRISTOPHER:
Piper, go home.

39:08.417 --> 39:11.692
Of all people, I understand this
all right, and so would Brooke.

39:11.792 --> 39:14.999
I can handle
this on my own.

39:19.042 --> 39:19.900
No.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.109
All right.

39:21.209 --> 39:23.709
We go in the front.

39:31.042 --> 39:33.899
Oh, look,
it's the Girl Scouts.

39:33.999 --> 39:36.609
Set your Thin Mints down
on the table and leave

39:36.709 --> 39:38.567
before you get yourselves hurt.

39:38.667 --> 39:39.275
Let her go.

39:39.375 --> 39:40.734
I have no fear of witches.

39:40.834 --> 39:43.999
Maybe not, but
how do you feel
about true love?

39:48.125 --> 39:50.292
That's not possible.

40:03.999 --> 40:06.959
If I can't have her,
no one will.

40:09.667 --> 40:10.375
Whoa!

40:10.999 --> 40:12.776
Anyone got a vanquish
in their pocket?

40:12.876 --> 40:15.359
Oh, let's not get rid
of him just yet.

40:15.459 --> 40:18.209
I want him to watch this
for a little bit.

40:18.999 --> 40:21.125
Okay, go ahead.

40:25.209 --> 40:32.542
Oh...
(<i>screaming</i>)

40:39.459 --> 40:41.442
I don't know
what to say.

40:41.542 --> 40:42.899
How can we thank you?

40:42.999 --> 40:44.692
You already have.

40:44.792 --> 40:46.899
PHOEBE:
Oh, Piper.

40:46.999 --> 40:48.899
I think I have a solution
to the whole

40:48.999 --> 40:49.942
maid-of-honor thing.

40:50.042 --> 40:50.900
Oh, me, too.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.899
What about our distinct lack
of a high priestess?

40:53.999 --> 40:54.818
Would you please

40:54.918 --> 40:56.999
just let <i>me</i> worry about that.

41:02.417 --> 41:05.776
GRAMS:
Girls, your
 high priestess is waiting.

41:05.876 --> 41:07.899
Unfortunately,
the eclipse is not.

41:07.999 --> 41:10.459
Now, let's move it.

41:11.999 --> 41:15.859
That would be your
cue, maids of honor.

41:15.959 --> 41:19.999
(<i>Pachebel's
"Canon in D" playing</i>)

41:36.792 --> 41:37.401
You look beautiful.

41:37.501 --> 41:41.192
I know it's not exactly
how you wanted it.

41:41.292 --> 41:43.959
But it's exactly
what I wanted.

42:02.999 --> 42:08.334
(<i>Leo gasps and groans</i>)

42:09.292 --> 42:11.999
(<i>anguished cries</i>)

42:19.584 --> 42:22.567
Grams, how can this happen?

42:22.667 --> 42:23.162
What did we do?

42:23.172 --> 42:25.109
What did we do?
Listen to me, darling.

42:25.209 --> 42:26.692
It's going to be okay.

42:26.792 --> 42:28.818
We <i>will</i> fix this.

42:28.918 --> 42:29.899
We, we have to.

42:29.999 --> 42:31.899
This... this is all my fault.

42:31.999 --> 42:33.776
He doesn't deserve to be...

42:33.876 --> 42:37.899
Oh, I don't, I don't
think I can do this.

42:37.999 --> 42:41.250
(<i>sobbing</i>)

42:48.167 --> 42:48.899
You do good work.

42:48.999 --> 42:53.401
To get close to the Halliwells
with no suspicion...

42:53.501 --> 42:53.942
Splendid.

42:54.042 --> 42:56.401
And we were pleased
that you informed us

42:56.501 --> 42:58.025
of the witch's nuptials.

42:58.125 --> 42:59.192
COLE:
The pleasure was mine.

42:59.292 --> 43:01.067
And the displeasure was <i>theirs</i>

43:01.167 --> 43:02.983
when the information
was... shared.

43:03.083 --> 43:05.651
You've gained useful
knowledge of the Charmed Ones.

43:05.751 --> 43:07.734
Now you must gain their trust.

43:07.834 --> 43:09.899
Others have failed.

43:09.999 --> 43:11.899
Others weren't me.

43:11.999 --> 43:14.359
So, what is next?

43:14.459 --> 43:18.067
The wedding was child's play...
a perk if you will.

43:18.167 --> 43:22.025
I'm focusing my attentions
on... Phoebe.

43:22.125 --> 43:23.734
She's my way in.

43:23.834 --> 43:26.234
You sent me up to find out
how to destroy them.

43:26.334 --> 43:29.584
I'd say we're well on our way.
