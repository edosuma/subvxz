01:51.560 --> 01:54.180
Yes, I am happy for this opportunity.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.780
And though some of my people
may not understand

01:56.880 --> 01:59.008
the benefit of this,
I'm sure they will in Cardiff.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.300
They are fortunate to have
a leader with such resolve.

02:02.400 --> 02:06.580
And now, let us stop
talking business, Mr. Prime Minister,

02:06.680 --> 02:09.047
and drink the first water
from the plant.

02:12.840 --> 02:14.251
- Thank you.
- Yes.

02:14.960 --> 02:15.961
Thank you.

02:18.760 --> 02:22.500
I hope this is the first
of many projects we can build.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.490
We say the dragon of fortune
has a long tail.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.683
- To Cardiff.
- To your new waterworks.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.860
- It is our great honor.
- And ours.

02:40.400 --> 02:44.260
All of us at Cardiff are so fortunate
to be doing business with you.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.964
Yes. Thank you.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.161
Mr. Prime Minister, thank you.

04:35.640 --> 04:36.721
You sleeping?

04:39.000 --> 04:40.180
Sweetie, what's going on?

04:40.280 --> 04:41.620
Beeze.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.961
Would you look at this?

04:45.240 --> 04:46.571
I mean...

04:46.680 --> 04:50.100
where did the energy come from suddenly?

04:50.200 --> 04:51.850
Please. Oh, my God.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.291
Are we there yet?

04:57.840 --> 05:02.860
According to this, we only have
eleven more soul-crushing hours.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.260
Oh, shit.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.220
You know you have to put
a dollar in the swear pot.

05:06.320 --> 05:10.660
Uh-oh, guys.
I left the swear pot back in Texas.

05:10.760 --> 05:13.060
- Shit! How could I have been so stupid.
- Dad. Dad!

05:13.160 --> 05:14.082
Jack.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.806
- Where's Bob?
- Hey, what are you looking for?

05:19.520 --> 05:21.727
- I can't find Bob.
- Did you look underneath?

05:21.840 --> 05:24.684
You're not supposed to say
the S-H-I-T word.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.140
The what?

05:26.240 --> 05:28.060
- Did you just spell that?
- Yes.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.620
No, you're not supposed to say it.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.620
I'm allowed to say it under
special emergency circumstances.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.580
- Well, actually...
- According to the rules...

05:34.680 --> 05:38.100
- And it wasn't an emergency.
- ...which I make up as I go along.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.170
- Where did he go?
- Sweetie, don't bother that woman.

05:42.160 --> 05:44.128
- I still don't see him.
- Okay.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.445
Uh-oh.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.367
- There you go.
- Hello, Bob. Thank you.

05:53.600 --> 05:54.681
- How are you?
- Good.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.363
- What happened to your hand?
- Mmm.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.205
Got in a fight with a tiger.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.300
- Really?
- Really.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.447
Don't worry, though.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.340
He got it worse than I did.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.090
What happened to your head?

06:10.320 --> 06:13.620
Oh... fell down a flight of stairs
in Hong Kong.

06:13.720 --> 06:16.929
Okay, honey, come on, sit down.
Don't bother him. Okay?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.128
- Sorry. Thank you.
- Pleasure.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.980
What if we don't like it here?

06:23.080 --> 06:25.740
Where we're going? I think we will.

06:25.840 --> 06:28.650
What if this company goes belly-up too?

06:31.520 --> 06:32.500
That's not gonna happen,

06:32.600 --> 06:36.740
because this company is a lot bigger
than Daddy's company was.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.700
And that's better, huh?

06:38.800 --> 06:39.801
Mm-hmm.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.608
They promised us a car, right, babe?

06:50.720 --> 06:52.940
Yeah, they did. But I don't...

06:53.040 --> 06:54.980
So can you call someone?

06:55.080 --> 06:58.260
Well, this phone's supposed to work
internationally, but it's not.

06:58.360 --> 07:01.762
I don't see anything. I think
we're really starting strong here.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.660
- Let's just grab one of these guys.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.300
Okay, thank you. Yep.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.780
Wait. A word to the wise here.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.980
These guys are a bunch of scam artists.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.420
They just wear uniforms
to look official,

07:14.520 --> 07:16.500
but they're all rob you blind,
I promise you.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.220
There's an official taxi line outside.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.780
I'll show you where if you like.
Come on.

07:19.880 --> 07:21.848
- Great. Thank you.
- Or you'll get ripped off.

07:21.960 --> 07:25.248
Don't worry, big boy. Don't worry.
Come over here. I'll show you.

07:26.920 --> 07:27.900
Here you go.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.060
- You forgot your bags.
- No, this is it, kiddo.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.300
I like to travel light.
You know what I mean?

07:33.400 --> 07:34.860
Well, that's convenient.

07:34.960 --> 07:38.060
- Where are you from?
- Austin, Texas.

07:38.160 --> 07:41.100
- Expats? Who do you work for?
- Cardiff.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.780
I'm one of the engineers they brought
in to revamp the waterworks.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.121
You Cardiff boys,
you go everywhere, don't you?

07:47.840 --> 07:49.580
Where are you staying?
The Imperial Lotus?

07:49.680 --> 07:52.340
- Yeah, how'd you know?
- Well, everyone does. I'm there.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.580
I'll give you a lift, if you'd like.
I'm meeting someone.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.340
- Would you like that?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.180
Be my pleasure. Be my pleasure.

07:58.280 --> 07:59.500
- Hammond's the name.
- Jack.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.980
- Nice to meet you, Jack.
- Nice to see you.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.380
- Hi, I'm Annie. How are you?
- Hello, Annie, how are you?

08:03.480 --> 08:04.900
This is Lucy, Briegel.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.260
- But you can call her Beeze.
- Hello, Beeze.

08:07.360 --> 08:09.900
- Do you like it here?
- I love it.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.780
I've been here 15 times.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.140
- Wow!
- That's a lot of times.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.380
Yeah, it is a lot of times.
Well, I just love it.

08:16.480 --> 08:17.700
I love the women.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.900
They're always so eager to please,
you know what I mean?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.780
Okay. It's interesting,

08:21.880 --> 08:24.620
I'm looking at our bags
and I'm thinking that we're too many...

08:24.720 --> 08:26.380
- No are you kidding?
- ...pieces of luggage.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.289
I think that we could maybe
just get a taxi...

08:28.400 --> 08:31.165
No, don't worry about these guys.
They can fit everything on a moped.

08:31.840 --> 08:32.860
It'll be great.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.847
Okay, everybody, here's your ride,
right here.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.419
This is the man!

08:40.520 --> 08:42.780
- Come on.
- You're in safe hands here.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.500
- I missed you.
- Look at you!

08:45.760 --> 08:47.046
There you go.
Mind the leg. Mind the leg.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.940
Good to see you.
These good folks here, they need a lift.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.140
Their ride didn't show up.

08:53.240 --> 08:54.340
- Yes, okay.
- Thanks.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.820
But I need to ask you
very important question.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.140
Okay.

08:58.240 --> 09:01.449
- Do you like Kenny Roger?
- Kenny Rogers?

09:04.400 --> 09:05.740
- Yes, of course.
- Yes.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.860
- Yes?
- Yes. Yeah.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.247
Because this is the Kenny Roger cab.

09:11.480 --> 09:14.060
Oh, my God! I had no idea.

09:14.160 --> 09:18.260
My name is
Samnang Pichairongkramgiskerong.

09:18.360 --> 09:19.820
- Jack.
- Wow! I like your name.

09:19.920 --> 09:23.300
Yeah? But all my friends call me...
Kenny Roger.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.020
- Oh, Kenny.
- That's a little easier.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.980
Because we look alike.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.206
You do?

09:31.320 --> 09:33.820
- Uncanny.
- Whoa! Separated at birth!

09:33.920 --> 09:35.331
- Let's go.
- Here we go.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.420
- Let's go. Come on.
- Here we go.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.340
I've got the birds.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.820
Hey, Kenny Rogers, you mind
keeping your eye on the road a little bit?

09:59.920 --> 10:01.340
Thank you.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.740
- This one's on us, okay?
- Okay. Thank you.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.020
- All right. Be safe.
- All right.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.100
You go.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.440
Okay.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.820
- This one's pretty.
- Daddy, look, it's you.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.980
- Oh, wow!
- It's your serious face.

11:15.080 --> 11:18.721
I would have preferred a driver,
but it's a nice welcome.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.460
Dad, this light doesn't work.

11:21.560 --> 11:23.220
What do you mean it doesn't work?

11:23.320 --> 11:24.900
I got Bob.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.500
Okay. Nope, it doesn't work.
You're right.

11:27.600 --> 11:31.060
But I gotta say, I'm loving
how unpredictable this hotel is.

11:31.160 --> 11:32.300
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.300
Because a lot of places you turn on
a switch, you know the light comes on.

11:35.400 --> 11:38.483
Here, there's some, like, mystery.
There's a little suspense.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.244
Annie, speaking of a mystery, what is...

11:43.040 --> 11:44.860
- What is this?
- It's my rice cooker.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.340
I know, but we're in Asia.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.620
Don't you think they're gonna have
some effective ways to cook rice?

11:49.720 --> 11:52.540
This is my rice cooker.

11:52.640 --> 11:55.180
Okay. Let's show 'em how we do it.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.780
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.500
- All right.
- I wanna go swimming.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.060
No, no, no, we can't go swimming.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.020
In fact, you gotta get ready for bed.

12:02.120 --> 12:05.420
I'm not tired,
and I really want to go swimming.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.220
Okay, I'll make a deal with you guys.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.060
We'll start to wind the engines down.

12:09.160 --> 12:12.482
You guys can sit here quietly
and watch some TV.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.020
We're not getting any channels.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.740
- Did you...?
- We're getting snow.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.100
Nothing's working!

12:22.200 --> 12:24.140
All right, let's not be difficult.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.660
Lucy's always been difficult.

12:25.760 --> 12:28.127
Since the day she was born,
she's been very difficult.

12:28.920 --> 12:30.300
- Dad.
- Guys. Guys.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.060
Dad, will you tell the story of how
Lucy was born?

12:32.160 --> 12:35.100
- Yeah. Sure.
- You guys like that story, don't you?

12:35.200 --> 12:37.980
Well, I gotta say,
it was a difficult birth.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.060
- I knew it!
- Good difficult.

12:39.160 --> 12:40.207
Good difficult.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.540
Do you want to call
about the television?

12:42.640 --> 12:45.980
No, no, I will call.
I will tell you the story. Hold on.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.048
Not difficult! Not difficult!

12:48.160 --> 12:49.650
The phone's not working.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.927
Okay, welcome to the Third World.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.380
It's actually the Fourth World.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.300
- Really?
- That's what it said in the book.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.300
- I didn't even know that existed.
- Nor did I.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.020
You didn't plug in the rice cooker.
Could that have...

13:01.120 --> 13:03.100
- No.
- ...possibly shorted out everything?

13:03.200 --> 13:04.980
You're a jerk.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.740
- It's happening in the whole city.
- What's happening?

13:07.840 --> 13:10.340
There's no TV or Internet
in the whole city?

13:10.440 --> 13:11.380
I'm afraid not, sir.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.500
Have you gotten any calls for me
from Cardiff?

13:13.600 --> 13:14.980
Jack Dwyer.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.140
- Are the phones working?
- The phones are working, sir.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.220
Okay.

13:18.320 --> 13:19.980
But we have no calls
from Cardiff for you.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.740
- No calls?
- Maybe better luck in the morning.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.080
Okay. Thank you.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.921
All right, here we go.
Here we go, here it comes.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.220
Can I get a beer?

13:56.800 --> 13:59.883
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

14:00.720 --> 14:02.051
Thank you!

14:02.760 --> 14:05.540
- That was great.
- Sitting over here all on your lonesome.

14:05.640 --> 14:07.020
You've got all jet-lagged, have you?

14:07.120 --> 14:09.780
Yeah, I'm in a little bit of a fog.

14:09.880 --> 14:10.860
What about you?

14:10.960 --> 14:12.660
Do I look like a guy who's jet-lagged?

14:12.760 --> 14:14.380
- No.
- No, no.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.220
All that shit's in the mind, mate.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.300
- It's all up here.
- Yep. You're right, it is. Yeah.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.722
Bullshit. Joe. Joe, two shots.
Here you go.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.940
I think I'm... I'm just gonna stick
with a beer.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.540
No, it's not for you. It's for me.

14:28.480 --> 14:29.481
Here we go.

14:30.480 --> 14:34.565
Is that guy playing a Casio keyboard
on top of a grand piano?

14:35.560 --> 14:38.580
Welcome to Asia.
You're gonna love it here.

14:38.680 --> 14:40.648
- Really?
- There's just so much to do.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.180
Well, I don't know.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.780
Ten years ago
I could not have pictured myself

14:45.880 --> 14:48.020
dragging my family
the other side of the world

14:48.120 --> 14:51.860
to start over in some
mid-management job.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.860
At least you're making a good living.

14:53.960 --> 14:57.089
And... doing good.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.380
Yeah.

14:59.480 --> 15:02.420
I know the bill of goods
those Cardiff boys sell you.

15:02.520 --> 15:05.140
You got something against
clean drinking water?

15:05.240 --> 15:06.241
Apparently.

15:10.360 --> 15:11.820
Maybe I do need a shot.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.260
No, you don't. No, you don't.
You got the kids upstairs.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.380
So what did you do, anyway?
In your better days.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.860
I invented a valve.

15:18.960 --> 15:19.940
Ah...

15:20.040 --> 15:21.820
I know it doesn't sound very sexy,
but it was.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.660
No. No, it doesn't.

15:23.760 --> 15:28.129
No, but we came up with this valve
that was almost a big deal.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.091
Came very close.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.645
Here's to almost.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.060
- Almost.
- Almost.

15:37.160 --> 15:38.400
Cheers.

15:42.520 --> 15:45.100
What about you?
You have any kids or anything?

15:45.200 --> 15:46.580
No.

15:46.680 --> 15:49.490
No. Not anymore.

15:52.280 --> 15:53.566
I guess...

15:54.320 --> 15:56.482
I guess I've seen better days, too.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.180
Yeah.

15:58.280 --> 16:01.740
On that note, I think
I'm gonna hit a strip joint.

16:01.840 --> 16:03.604
- All right.
- Yeah.

16:04.240 --> 16:07.060
Perhaps I should change
into my sweatpants.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.700
Yeah, let them know I mean business.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.340
Oh, yeah.

16:11.440 --> 16:15.340
Listen, don't let the bastards
get you down, okay?

16:15.440 --> 16:17.300
- All right. Thank you.
- Of course.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.526
Yeah. See ya.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.900
Hon, are you okay? Are you sick?

17:37.000 --> 17:37.980
No.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.180
What are you doing?

17:40.280 --> 17:41.884
I'm just tired. I just...

17:44.040 --> 17:46.042
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.286
No.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.650
Annie, I'm sorry I didn't...

17:55.760 --> 17:58.380
I wasn't trying to fool you with this.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.860
- It's okay.
- I know I just...

18:00.960 --> 18:03.940
I wasn't planning for things
to work out like this,

18:04.040 --> 18:08.780
but I thought that
this is the best option available.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.380
- Jack, I can't.
- I know. And I'm doing the best...

18:11.480 --> 18:14.723
- I can't comfort you right now.
- No, I know. I'm not...

18:22.960 --> 18:23.961
All right.

18:44.480 --> 18:47.131
Any word from Cardiff? Jack Dwyer.

18:47.800 --> 18:49.404
I'm afraid not, sir. I'm very sorry.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.660
Do you have a newspaper?

18:51.760 --> 18:54.180
Our delivery did not come in
today, sir. We have none.

18:54.280 --> 18:55.700
Is there some place I can go to get one?

18:55.800 --> 18:57.780
Yes. Yes, you can go to Kampuchea Krom.

18:57.880 --> 19:00.008
Okay. I don't know where that is.

19:02.560 --> 19:05.060
This is where we are,
and this is Kampuchea Krom.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.580
When you get to Mao Tse-Tung,
turn right. But only half.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.540
- Only half.
- Yeah.

19:09.640 --> 19:10.980
Newspapers, sir.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.684
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

21:11.840 --> 21:14.730
Do you have any newspapers in English?

21:15.560 --> 21:18.928
Do you have The Herald Tribune
or USA Today?

21:20.440 --> 21:22.647
Do you have any American newspapers?

21:32.400 --> 21:33.401
Great.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.401
Thank you.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.289
This is from three days ago.
Do you have one that's newer?

21:50.200 --> 21:51.361
Thanks.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.686
Go, go, go!

25:33.240 --> 25:35.925
What's happening? I'm an American.

25:36.760 --> 25:39.380
Get your fucking hands off of me!

25:39.480 --> 25:40.860
Let go of me!

25:43.640 --> 25:45.620
Get your hands off of me! Let me go!

26:42.880 --> 26:44.180
They're coming into the hotel.

26:44.280 --> 26:45.406
It's not safe.

26:53.280 --> 26:54.540
Put the table there. Bring more chairs.

26:54.640 --> 26:58.406
Sir, please go back to your rooms.
Until the situation is over.

28:03.360 --> 28:06.011
Are you gonna even use your goggles?
I feel like you never use it.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.220
- Annie?
- Coming, coming, coming.

28:09.320 --> 28:10.580
Annie, open up.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.740
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

28:12.840 --> 28:14.620
- Is something wrong?
- Lock the door.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.260
There's like a war going on out there.

28:16.360 --> 28:17.340
- What?
- Come here look.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.220
- Honey, slow down.
- Look, look, you see that?

28:19.320 --> 28:21.220
- They're overrunning the police.
- I don't see anything.

28:21.320 --> 28:23.860
- Come here. Here, look.
- You're scaring me, stop it.

28:23.960 --> 28:26.566
- Can you see that smoke?
- What? No! I don't see anything.

28:26.680 --> 28:28.340
Annie, they are killing people.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.442
They are pulling them out
and just shooting them.

28:30.560 --> 28:31.540
- Foreigners.
- Why?

28:31.640 --> 28:33.460
- Just out there.
- You saw the people...

28:33.560 --> 28:36.140
I don't know what's going on.
They just shot a guy in front of me.

28:36.240 --> 28:38.460
- Please!
- Annie, they are here in the hotel.

28:38.560 --> 28:40.130
They're in the lobby.

28:41.440 --> 28:42.441
Where's Lucy?

28:44.600 --> 28:46.140
- Lucy?
- Lucy?

28:46.240 --> 28:47.580
- Lucy? She was right here.
- Lucy?

28:47.680 --> 28:50.340
- Lucy, right now.
- She left.

28:50.440 --> 28:51.930
What do you mean she left?

28:52.680 --> 28:54.444
- Where did she go?
- She went to the pool.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.220
You let her go to the pool by herself?

28:57.320 --> 28:58.980
No, I didn't let her go down by herself.

28:59.080 --> 29:01.180
- She's been acting out.
- Stay here and lock the door.

29:01.280 --> 29:02.940
- Are you sure?
- Lock the door. Lock the door!

29:03.040 --> 29:04.644
Wait!

29:04.760 --> 29:07.081
- It's fourth floor. Fourth floor.
- Shut the door.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.780
Okay, let's go put on
different clothes, honey. Okay?

29:14.880 --> 29:16.120
It's all right, don't be scared.

29:48.400 --> 29:49.660
Here we go.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.411
Finish the other one.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.380
You know what, Briegel?

30:17.480 --> 30:19.244
Get in the bathroom
and lock the door, please.

30:20.240 --> 30:21.321
Now.

31:10.680 --> 31:13.340
Get out! Get out!

31:19.400 --> 31:21.448
Leave them alone! Leave them alone!

31:22.440 --> 31:24.169
No, leave them alone.

31:29.400 --> 31:30.401
No...

31:50.800 --> 31:52.131
Mommy?

31:53.240 --> 31:54.321
Bathroom, Beeze. Now.

32:13.840 --> 32:14.841
Lucy?

32:15.840 --> 32:16.841
Lucy?

32:18.320 --> 32:19.845
Lucy?

32:22.880 --> 32:24.530
Get out of the pool. Come here.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.804
Get out of the pool.

32:39.360 --> 32:40.361
Come here.

33:14.120 --> 33:15.610
Get to the roof! Go!

33:18.400 --> 33:19.925
Get up to the roof.

33:28.960 --> 33:30.420
Annie?

33:30.520 --> 33:32.443
- Jack.
- Annie, open up.

33:33.520 --> 33:34.521
Jack.

33:35.320 --> 33:37.084
- Shit.
- What the hell happened?

33:37.200 --> 33:39.580
She's okay, she's okay.

33:39.680 --> 33:40.806
We gotta get out.

33:43.120 --> 33:45.060
Annie, we got to get to the roof.

33:45.160 --> 33:47.700
- Come here.
- We can't, we can't leave here.

33:47.800 --> 33:49.380
They are out there, Jack.

33:49.480 --> 33:51.540
No, we just came...
We just came on this floor.

33:51.640 --> 33:52.820
We can stay here.

33:52.920 --> 33:55.060
Trust me.
We got to get them to the roof.

33:55.160 --> 33:57.020
Okay? We have to go now, trust me.

33:57.120 --> 33:58.167
Please. Okay?

33:59.160 --> 34:00.161
- Okay.
- We got to go.

34:07.980 --> 34:10.290
- Mom! Mommy, Bob!
- No, no!

34:11.360 --> 34:12.739
No, come on.

34:12.840 --> 34:14.060
No!

34:14.159 --> 34:16.500
- No, no.
- Stop it.

34:17.300 --> 34:20.250
No. Come on, go, go, go.

34:25.320 --> 34:26.924
Oh, my God! It's okay.

34:28.239 --> 34:29.241
Close your eyes.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.449
Here we are.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.100
Hold the door. Don't let him through.

34:35.199 --> 34:36.690
Open up. We're Americans, open up.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.086
I'm gonna sit over there.

35:48.200 --> 35:50.620
- Are you okay?
- Okay. Here.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.260
- You okay?
- Are you all right? Good.

35:52.360 --> 35:54.260
Good! You girls are very good.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.169
- Let me just see what's going on.
- Yeah, yeah.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.420
- You know what's happening?
- We have no Idea.

35:59.520 --> 36:01.340
Does somebody know we're up on the roof?

36:01.440 --> 36:02.900
- I hope so.
- Can you get a signal?

36:03.000 --> 36:04.570
- I wasn't getting a signal.
- It's not working.

36:04.680 --> 36:07.340
Someone over there said
the prime minister has been killed.

36:07.440 --> 36:09.060
Don't go near there mate.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.049
Stay back. They'll take a shot at you.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.140
What are they screaming?

36:17.240 --> 36:19.460
I don't know. It's some crazy fuck
down there. He's gone ballistic.

36:19.560 --> 36:20.740
We'll just hold the roof.

36:20.840 --> 36:23.460
We'll kill any of those fuckers
who try to come up here.

36:24.560 --> 36:25.940
Hold on, my wife speaks French.

36:26.040 --> 36:28.460
Hey, Annie, this guy's
speaking French. Can you...

36:28.560 --> 36:29.540
Hold on, hold on.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.300
Okay.

36:33.400 --> 36:36.609
- What's he saying?
- He's telling me, don't resist.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.980
There's no prisoners because
they're gonna kill us anyway.

36:40.080 --> 36:43.500
They keep saying it over and over again.

36:50.840 --> 36:53.660
Blood for water. Blood for water?

36:53.760 --> 36:55.060
What does that mean?

36:55.160 --> 36:56.969
- He doesn't know.
- He'll know, the bellhop.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.540
Hey, mate, what does
"blood for water" mean?

37:01.640 --> 37:04.120
They're shouting out "blood for water."
What does it mean?

37:04.720 --> 37:08.361
Americans take over our water company,
and they don't like it.

37:09.960 --> 37:12.725
- Listen, guys, we just got a whole...
- Cardiff?

37:14.320 --> 37:17.140
Is he talking about Cardiff?
Did you know anything about this?

37:17.240 --> 37:19.020
Of course not.
I thought we were here to help.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.246
Dad?

37:21.400 --> 37:24.420
- Are people trying to kill us?
- No, they're not trying to kill us.

37:24.520 --> 37:26.780
Lucy, there are people trying
to hurt us down below.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.620
- Don't tell her that.
- That's why we came up.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.580
No, I don't want to pretend
this isn't happening.

37:30.680 --> 37:32.020
We're gonna stick together,

37:32.120 --> 37:33.900
and you just listen
to what your mom says,

37:34.000 --> 37:35.365
and you watch out
for your little sister.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.860
- Why are people trying to kill us?
- I don't know, they just are.

37:37.960 --> 37:39.900
You need to keep an eye out on Beeze,

37:40.000 --> 37:43.060
because she's your little sister
and she needs your help all right?

37:43.160 --> 37:46.300
We just wait here
and then help is gonna come.

37:46.400 --> 37:47.940
Can you hear the helicopter?

37:48.040 --> 37:50.340
Jack, do you hear that?
Is that a helicopter?

37:50.440 --> 37:52.220
Okay, here, you hear that?

37:52.320 --> 37:55.940
- Yeah, that's a helicopter.
- We're getting out of here.

37:56.040 --> 37:59.761
See, everything is gonna be okay.
Okay, right?

37:59.880 --> 38:01.940
- Yeah! You okay? Are you hurt?
- Right?

38:02.040 --> 38:03.500
You made me leave Bob.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.340
- All right.
- We will get you another Bob.

38:05.440 --> 38:06.860
I don't want a new Bob.

38:06.960 --> 38:08.380
- All right.
- It's been a long day.

38:08.480 --> 38:10.380
You didn't even say what the deal is?

38:10.480 --> 38:11.900
Okay, how about this deal?

38:12.000 --> 38:14.287
We'll get you a dog.
We'll get you a new puppy, all right?

38:15.000 --> 38:17.367
- A bulldog?
- Yeah, a bulldog.

38:18.160 --> 38:19.286
An ugly one?

38:20.760 --> 38:22.980
Ugliest one you've ever seen.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.844
- Deal.
- Deal.

38:39.600 --> 38:40.601
See it?

39:06.600 --> 39:08.300
Get down.

39:08.400 --> 39:09.686
Keep your head down.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.244
You okay? You okay?

39:56.320 --> 39:58.220
Wait, Jack. Jack?

39:58.320 --> 39:59.446
What are we doing?

40:08.120 --> 40:09.645
Jack, what are you doing?

40:10.360 --> 40:11.260
Shit!

40:11.360 --> 40:14.569
Come here. Come here. Come here.

40:14.680 --> 40:15.980
We'll get to the other side. I got you.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.491
- Go, go, go.
- You got it.

40:17.600 --> 40:19.011
- Go, go, go.
- Go, go, go.

40:25.440 --> 40:27.602
- Move.
- Okay, over here.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.780
- Stay down.
- Stay right here, okay?

40:31.880 --> 40:32.860
Get under here.

40:32.960 --> 40:34.007
What?

40:35.160 --> 40:36.650
- We got to get over to that roof.
- What?

40:38.720 --> 40:41.580
- No, no fucking way.
- Annie, listen to me.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.100
What are we gonna do?

40:43.200 --> 40:44.540
We got to do it. They're gonna come.

40:44.640 --> 40:45.766
- We're gonna hide there.
- No.

40:45.880 --> 40:47.860
When they get through that, that's it.
We're dead.

40:47.960 --> 40:49.780
- Jack, no.
- Okay, over there we have a chance.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.380
Over there? We don't know what's there.

40:51.480 --> 40:52.820
Over there, they're gonna be
the same kind of people.

40:52.920 --> 40:56.260
All I know is, we got to keep putting
ten steps between us and them. Okay?

40:56.360 --> 40:58.020
- If we stay here they'll kill us.
- Jack come on.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.140
That's crazy, that's fucking crazy.

41:00.240 --> 41:02.402
Look at me,
we're gonna fucking die here.

41:02.520 --> 41:05.820
Listen to me, we don't have a choice.
Please, we don't have a choice.

41:05.920 --> 41:07.180
- How?
- You're gonna jump first,

41:07.280 --> 41:09.420
and then I'm gonna throw the kids over
one at a time.

41:09.520 --> 41:10.681
Then I'm gonna follow, okay?

41:12.760 --> 41:14.540
- Come on. You can do this.
- Okay.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.608
- How? How?
- Come on. Right here.

41:17.240 --> 41:18.500
Just get up here.

41:18.600 --> 41:20.011
Right here.

41:20.120 --> 41:22.980
You're gonna get a good running start,
and then you just jump it, okay?

41:23.080 --> 41:25.900
- Okay.
- Don't do it, Mommy.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.260
Stop, stop. Get away.
Stop. Stop, she can do it.

41:29.360 --> 41:30.566
Go, go.

41:44.040 --> 41:45.500
Shit!

41:45.600 --> 41:47.841
- I can't, I can't.
- What are you doing? Yes, you can.

41:51.720 --> 41:54.380
Annie, look at me. Just do it.
Don't think about it. Okay?

41:54.480 --> 41:55.700
Stop yelling at me, Jack.

41:55.800 --> 41:58.220
- Don't think about it. Look at me.
- Don't do it, Mommy!

41:58.320 --> 41:59.620
- Look at me.
- Mommy!

41:59.720 --> 42:00.960
Oh, man, I'm scared.

42:10.200 --> 42:11.201
You okay?

42:12.280 --> 42:14.300
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

42:14.400 --> 42:16.220
Okay, I'm gonna send the Beeze over.

42:16.320 --> 42:18.260
- She's okay.
- No! No.

42:18.360 --> 42:19.900
I need you to close your eyes
for a second.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.002
- No, don't do it.
- Okay.

42:25.520 --> 42:27.060
I don't want you to throw me to Mommy.

42:27.160 --> 42:29.900
Okay, I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna do it. All right?

42:30.000 --> 42:31.525
What's the name
of your bulldog gonna be?

42:32.200 --> 42:34.660
- Chow-chow.
- Is that a better name than Winston?

42:34.760 --> 42:37.411
- You think?
- No!

42:53.520 --> 42:55.329
Briegel, you okay, honey?

42:56.800 --> 42:57.980
Good girl.

42:58.080 --> 42:59.081
Come on.

43:00.360 --> 43:01.340
No.

43:01.440 --> 43:04.060
- Lucy.
- No.

43:04.160 --> 43:05.260
- Lucy, come here.
- No!

43:05.360 --> 43:07.140
Listen to me.

43:08.520 --> 43:10.140
Listen, I got to get you to that roof.

43:10.240 --> 43:12.242
If I don't, those bad people
are gonna hurt you.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.086
Okay, come here.

43:17.160 --> 43:18.571
- No. No!
- You can, I know.

43:20.120 --> 43:21.531
No.

43:22.560 --> 43:23.766
Daddy!

43:25.560 --> 43:27.420
Jack!

43:27.520 --> 43:30.260
- Pull up.
- Don't drop me!

43:30.360 --> 43:32.362
Hold on, grab my arm. Grab it.

43:33.760 --> 43:35.660
Come on. Pull.

43:35.760 --> 43:37.524
Pull.

43:47.840 --> 43:49.620
Lucy, we almost went over.

43:49.720 --> 43:52.180
Listen to me. If I tell you
to do something, you gotta do it.

43:52.280 --> 43:54.123
- Okay?
- I'm scared.

43:55.760 --> 43:57.125
I know, I'm scared too.

43:57.800 --> 44:00.121
Okay, but it's gonna be okay.
Just close your eyes.

44:00.240 --> 44:01.287
No.

44:02.280 --> 44:03.820
- No.
- Lucy.

44:03.920 --> 44:05.126
No!

44:23.920 --> 44:25.081
Honey, are you okay?

44:26.040 --> 44:27.700
You all right?

44:27.800 --> 44:29.370
Okay, okay.

44:30.880 --> 44:33.611
It's okay. Get your breath, come on.
Good girls.

44:34.280 --> 44:36.806
Good girls. I'm so sorry.

44:41.680 --> 44:42.681
Okay.

44:54.120 --> 44:55.460
- Are you okay?
- Yep, I'm fine.

44:55.560 --> 44:57.005
Okay, go, underneath.

45:10.480 --> 45:12.300
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes.

45:12.400 --> 45:13.640
Okay. All right.

45:17.120 --> 45:18.121
Goddamn it.

45:20.600 --> 45:21.726
Shit!

45:23.840 --> 45:25.020
Right here. We can get down here.

45:25.120 --> 45:26.340
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

45:26.440 --> 45:27.860
- Just ten more steps.
- Ten more steps.

45:27.960 --> 45:29.900
- Just ten more steps.
- Ten more steps. Go, go.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.365
Go, go, go...

45:41.400 --> 45:42.970
Okay, send Lucy down.

45:45.280 --> 45:47.408
Okay, I got her.

45:48.560 --> 45:50.300
- You okay?
- Yeah.

45:50.400 --> 45:53.260
Okay, again, here we go.
I got you. I got you.

45:53.360 --> 45:55.044
Okay, let her go.

45:55.720 --> 45:56.721
Okay.

45:57.480 --> 45:58.540
Go.

45:58.640 --> 45:59.660
- Come one.
- Okay.

45:59.760 --> 46:01.580
- Put your foot right there. I got you.
- Yeah.

46:01.680 --> 46:03.364
There we go. Over here.

46:06.800 --> 46:08.245
Down, down, honey. Down.

46:09.880 --> 46:10.847
Sit down for a second.

46:12.360 --> 46:13.441
Okay.

46:16.560 --> 46:17.846
Are you okay?

46:19.040 --> 46:20.020
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

46:20.120 --> 46:22.940
We're gonna get through this, okay?

46:23.040 --> 46:24.166
I know.

46:25.320 --> 46:26.606
Lucy, you okay?

46:27.440 --> 46:29.204
- Okay.
- Beeze, you all right?

46:30.360 --> 46:31.780
Briegel. Honey.

46:31.880 --> 46:33.180
Beeze, will you look at me?

46:33.280 --> 46:35.248
I want to go home.

46:37.560 --> 46:38.561
I know.

46:45.800 --> 46:48.820
Dad, can you tell us the story
about when I was born.

46:48.920 --> 46:51.340
No, not right now honey.

46:51.440 --> 46:52.646
I'll tell you later.

46:59.960 --> 47:00.961
I'm hungry.

47:04.200 --> 47:07.300
Hi, hungry. I'm Dad.

47:07.400 --> 47:09.140
That's not funny.

47:09.240 --> 47:11.100
I'm not funny, I'm Dad.

47:11.200 --> 47:12.770
Still not funny.

47:14.960 --> 47:16.500
I think you're funny.

47:16.600 --> 47:19.900
And that's why you're my favorite.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.286
- That's mean.
- I mean, both of you.

47:21.960 --> 47:24.247
- Both of you.
- Dad!

47:24.920 --> 47:26.604
Come here.

47:33.520 --> 47:35.460
Get down.

47:35.560 --> 47:37.324
Keep down, keep down, keep down.

47:39.800 --> 47:41.940
There's a tank out there.
We need to move.

47:42.040 --> 47:43.087
What?

47:48.200 --> 47:49.929
Come on, there's a tank.

47:51.480 --> 47:53.323
In here.

47:56.880 --> 47:57.881
Go! Go!

48:25.120 --> 48:27.540
- Okay? You okay?
- Yeah.

48:27.640 --> 48:30.060
Honey, you okay?

48:44.120 --> 48:45.770
Get back, get back. Go.

48:52.880 --> 48:54.086
Get back.

48:54.840 --> 48:57.460
Jack? Oh... oh, shit!

48:57.560 --> 48:59.220
In here, in here.

50:30.600 --> 50:33.410
They're gone. It's okay, they're gone.

50:38.600 --> 50:43.049
Mommy, I have to go potty.

50:47.680 --> 50:49.100
Just...

50:49.200 --> 50:52.090
It's okay, just go in your pants, okay.

50:53.120 --> 50:55.964
But... I'm not a baby.

50:56.800 --> 50:59.500
I know, I know sweetheart. I know that.

50:59.600 --> 51:00.601
I know.

51:01.640 --> 51:03.180
Just this one time, okay.

51:03.280 --> 51:04.611
But...

51:06.320 --> 51:07.924
I promise it's okay.

51:08.680 --> 51:09.681
It's okay, Beeze.

51:15.200 --> 51:16.247
It's okay.

51:34.920 --> 51:36.649
Do you know how much I love you?

51:40.800 --> 51:43.007
You know, I love you.

51:45.600 --> 51:48.080
Jack, nobody even knows we're here.

51:50.800 --> 51:52.325
Nobody's gonna come to help us.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.020
We got to get ourselves
to the American Embassy.

51:55.120 --> 51:58.681
That's what we're gonna do.
We can do that. Okay?

52:02.960 --> 52:04.740
We're gonna get there.

52:04.840 --> 52:05.921
Okay.

52:26.360 --> 52:27.860
Okay, I know, I know.

52:27.960 --> 52:29.371
Come here honey. Are you okay?

52:30.040 --> 52:32.566
- Here you go.
- We can't go out like this, honey.

52:33.280 --> 52:34.805
Let me get something for us to put on.

52:34.920 --> 52:35.921
Okay.

52:37.240 --> 52:38.366
Let me look around.

52:44.520 --> 52:46.170
Don't look. Please, don't look.

52:57.720 --> 53:00.485
Come here. Don't look.

53:04.800 --> 53:06.882
Don't look down.

53:16.240 --> 53:17.685
- I don't like it here.
- I know.

53:20.560 --> 53:22.767
Just stay put. Stay put.

53:33.920 --> 53:36.651
Can't read this. Can't read this map.

53:37.680 --> 53:40.126
- What are you looking for?
- The Embassy.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.820
- Mom, look.
- What?

54:02.920 --> 54:04.046
An American flag.

54:04.760 --> 54:06.603
Very good, very good.

54:07.320 --> 54:08.810
Jack...

54:09.800 --> 54:11.780
Okay, so here's the American Embassy,

54:11.880 --> 54:14.300
but do you know
where we are on this map?

54:14.400 --> 54:17.140
We're right here, right about here.

54:17.240 --> 54:20.060
Okay, that's, like, five blocks away
and I think...

54:41.240 --> 54:42.844
Shut up.

54:47.320 --> 54:48.321
Quiet.

54:50.080 --> 54:51.286
Stop it.

54:52.720 --> 54:53.767
Okay?

54:54.720 --> 54:56.131
You can't scream.

54:57.160 --> 54:58.207
You can't.

55:14.440 --> 55:15.441
No!

56:06.960 --> 56:08.644
Ten more steps.

56:12.080 --> 56:14.208
Let me get the clothes.

57:11.920 --> 57:12.900
Hey...

57:13.000 --> 57:14.460
Hey.

57:14.560 --> 57:15.766
Come on.

57:53.160 --> 57:54.889
Couple more blocks.

58:46.720 --> 58:48.210
Take a right here.

59:03.080 --> 59:04.081
Jack...

59:04.680 --> 59:07.300
- Turn around, turn around Jack.
- Where?

59:07.400 --> 59:09.620
Don't do it. We go back
where we came from.

59:12.240 --> 59:13.620
You guys, put your head down.

59:13.720 --> 59:14.700
Pull it over.

59:14.800 --> 59:17.020
- Jack...
- We can't, get your head down.

59:17.120 --> 59:19.260
- Stay down, stay down.
- Jack, please.

59:19.360 --> 59:21.140
Please.

59:27.480 --> 59:30.211
Get your head down. Tuck your head in.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:03.327
I'm slipping.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.684
- Right here?
- Yeah.

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.140
- Okay.
- I can get up right here.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.780
- Let's go.
- No.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.620
No, we're here. We gotta go over.

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.700
- This doesn't look like it.
- Why?

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.620
No, no, they put this up as a defense.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.802
I don't hear anything.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.500
- Okay, let me take a look.
- Can I come?

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.460
Get behind...
No, no, listen to your mom.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.291
- Get behind. I'm gonna take a look.
- What are you gonna do?

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.770
Be careful.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:54.970
You okay?

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.020
You see anything?

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.964
- Hold on, let me get a better look.
- Okay.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.245
Daddy!

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.361
Jack!

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.060
Daddy!

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.900
Annie!

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.650
Over here!

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.081
Come on.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.360
Come here.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.485
Okay, okay.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.740
Hey, hey!

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:18.140
No!

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.402
Please, family.

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:24.409
Please, family.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.041
Please.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.740
It's okay, okay.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.126
Stick close.

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.164
Lucy, get down.

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:13.327
We don't know where. We find you.

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:53.005
We need that gun, wait here.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.326
Daddy.

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.049
Don't know where. We find you.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:31.247
Find you, I kill you.

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:49.851
Oh, Jack, hide.

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.001
Oh, my God! They'll see him. Shit!

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:07.460
Okay, girls, girls, Daddy needs help.

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:11.260
No matter what you hear,
you don't move from here.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.361
Okay?

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.246
Okay.

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:30.620
Hey, okay, okay. Hey, I'm right here.

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:37.860
Okay, okay.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.500
Jack, grab it!

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.940
Hey, fuckhead! Hey!

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.431
Jack!

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.620
No! No!

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:34.803
No!

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.779
No, no, no!

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.380
Get the fuck of me!

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.531
Fucking kill...

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:53.700
No! No!

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.420
I'll fucking kill you!

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.060
Goddamn it!

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.764
Oh, my God!

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.819
Wait! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.660
Don't shoot! I got money.

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.819
Wait, wait, I have money. I got money.

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:12.779
I got money, I got guns.

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.540
I got...

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:18.899
I can get guns. I can get guns.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.500
Sung, Sung. Everyone likes Sung.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:25.285
I've got one, three and five,
you've got two and six!

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.081
Shit!

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.140
Oh, my God!

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.740
I'm okay.

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:56.660
- I said I got one, three and five.
- Yeah, but that three there.

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.580
That guy over there is three.

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:01.420
- From your position, that's two.
- No, it's not.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.171
The clock is based on my head,
not on my feet.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:09.531
- You happy now?
- That's good enough.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.860
All right, quickly, come on.
Everyone go.

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.860
- We've got to get out of here right now.
- Get the girls.

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.780
That guy is gonna come back,
and he'll bring friends.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:18.140
- Now hurry.
- Come on, there's more coming.

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.380
- Quickly.
- It's okay, it's okay, come on.

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.580
There's a house I know
a few blocks from here.

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.047
- We'll be safe for the night.
- I'm right here honey.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.285
Mommy! Mommy!

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:29.580
Hurry!

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:31.380
I'll buy you some time.

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:34.529
- Okay.
- Come on, come on.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:36.881
Let's go.

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:42.220
- Come on.
- No, I don't want to!

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.243
- I don't want to go.
- Lucy.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:47.900
This is no time to discuss this, okay.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.526
Look at me, look at me, look at me.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.820
My daughter gave me this
the last time I saw her,

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.780
and she said

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.980
nothing bad would ever happen
to me as long as I wear it.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:03.020
I'd like you to take it. Okay.

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:06.460
Okay, you're safe now.
No matter what, okay.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.460
- What about Beeze?
- It'll work for Beeze.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:11.220
It'll work for both of you.
There's nothing to be scared of.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.700
You're safe now, okay?

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.820
Stay quiet, stay fast,
and stay close. Okay.

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.420
You hurt? You've got blood right here.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.851
Oh, that's not mine.

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.849
- Come on.
- Okay, come on. Okay.

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:21.961
Come on.

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:27.740
Here we go.

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.500
Keep up now, come on.

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.489
Here we go, upstairs.

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.220
- Kosal.
- Hey, Hammond.

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.020
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.780
Listen...

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.460
we're gonna spend the night here, okay?

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.540
- Okay.
- Good, good.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.580
Are you okay?
Would you care for some tea?

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:26.127
Yeah, a cup of tea would be nice,
maybe a drop of the hard stuff.

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.485
You smell lovely.

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:35.700
All right, through here.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.740
Here we go, family.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:39.820
- All right.
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:41.763
Out onto the roof.

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.420
We made it.

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.602
Glad to see you're
all in one piece, Kenny.

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.460
Come on up, everyone.

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:56.721
Come on, here we are.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:01.060
Ah, you guys must be starving.
There's enough food here for everyone.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.780
Come on, come sit down.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:05.087
- Good?
- Nice.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.001
Well done.

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:11.740
You like it?

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.260
- What is it?
- "What is it?"

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.601
You mean to tell me you haven't had
Kan Chow Chicken yet?

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.380
You're gonna love this.

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:21.060
They feed the chicken's raisins.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:22.844
- Really?
- Really.

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:25.140
Makes the chickens taste sweet.

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:27.180
Raisins? That's interesting.

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.620
What do they the feed
the chickens in the US?

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:31.529
In the US?

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.531
Usually other chickens, I think.

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:40.940
Okay, Mom, Dad, can I have
a word with you? Just over here.

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.660
Yeah, yes.

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.683
- You should eat something.
- Come on.

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:49.721
Okay, eat.

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.460
- You see the river there?
- Yeah.

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:58.700
The Vietnamese border
is a couple of miles downstream.

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.540
If we can just get across,
they'll have to give us asylum.

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:04.460
And then we can leave
all this behind us.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.561
- All right?
- Yeah.

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:07.801
Hammond, thank you.

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:10.260
My pleasure, my pleasure, don't worry.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.442
Jack I'm gonna go check on the kids.

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.606
You're not just here
for the girls are you?

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.020
Nah.

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.580
Well... maybe a little.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.540
You British CIA or something?

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.860
- Something like that.
- And Kenny he's...

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.200
Mm-hmm.

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.460
- Thanks.
- Nah.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.380
No, thanks for coming
along when you did.

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:43.100
Don't thank me.
I'm the one who started this shit storm!

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.460
What do you mean?

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:48.940
Guys like me pave the way
for guys like you to wind up here.

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:51.300
They don't usually fight back.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:54.140
Most of the time, they don't
even realize what we're doing.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:57.005
- Why? What do you mean?
- We...

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.780
have interests in this region.

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:02.087
- We?
- Our countries.

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:06.940
The corporations
who run them have interests here.

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.566
So I show up all nice and friendly,

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.620
offering to get them
a loan to pay for our services,

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.540
which we know they can't afford.

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.820
Then we build them power plants,

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:20.780
waterworks, freeways...
It doesn't really matter.

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:23.486
And when they can't repay us the debt...

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:26.766
we own 'em.

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:30.528
It's all a fuck job.

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:36.740
The rebel leaders said we were
trying to enslave their people

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:39.100
by controlling the waterworks.

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.820
And they were right.

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:44.100
Most of those merciless men out there...

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.407
they're just trying to
protect their children,

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:48.060
just like you.

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.650
So don't thank me.

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:53.620
I'm the one who put your
family in harm's way.

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:56.405
Least I can do is get you
out of the bloody place.

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.324
Is that Kan Chow Chicken there?

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:05.880
- Looks like dog.
- You need your strength, Jack.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.050
They need your strength too, mate.

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.740
Raisins?

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.001
Seemed like a nice touch.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.130
I killed someone.

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.940
You're alive, Jack.

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:26.180
Your family's alive.

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.647
There's no good
or bad here, there's only...

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:31.847
just get your family the hell out.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.286
Come on.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:39.603
Get some sleep. We leave in four hours.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:16:59.601
You all right?

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:15.723
In hindsight, I probably didn't need
to bring the rice-cooker.

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:19.410
Are you kidding me?
We couldn't leave that behind.

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:26.220
Thank you for sticking with me
the last few years

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:29.780
because I know it's not what you wanted,

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:32.008
what you hoped for.

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.003
If my life had been the way I wanted...

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.727
I'd be in Paris.

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:43.060
I'd be in a flat in Saint-Sulpice.

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:44.660
Drinking wine.

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.842
Sounds pretty good.

01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:54.044
But then I wouldn't have met you.

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.926
And I wouldn't know
those beautiful girls.

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:04.851
And the profound...

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.843
thing it is to be their mother.

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.321
This life...

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.521
has been so much more...

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:22.380
than anything that I could have...

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.050
wanted or planned.

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:33.041
If we die here tomorrow,
it will have been worth it.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:44.322
Look at me...

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.140
No one's gonna die here.

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.900
Get to the wall, get to the wall.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.684
Get down, get down, get down.

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:32.820
Okay, okay, there's
a gun tower across the street,

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:34.524
stay low.

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:39.500
There's four of them in the tower.
Now I'm gonna draw fire.

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:42.140
I want you to run
like hell for that staircase.

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:43.580
Do you understand me?

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:44.980
- You ready?
- Wait, wait.

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.180
- You ready?
- Okay.

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.009
Go!

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:22.060
No!

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:24.083
That door! Go to that door!

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.281
Oh, God!

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.485
God!

01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:14.606
Keep going!

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:16.927
- Come on.
- Get across the border.

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:23.580
Just go.

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.682
You'll have some better days, Jack.

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.725
Keep going! Go!

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:57.300
Too bad I couldn't make it!

01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:58.890
Shit! God!

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.365
Wait for it.

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.206
Wait for it.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:20.900
Wait for it!

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.241
Come to papa, fucker!

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.606
Fucker!

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:48.180
Wait. Wait.

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:49.770
Hang on, hang on.

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.370
What are we gonna do now?

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:55.646
I don't know. Okay.

01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:59.041
I don't know.

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:00.841
What are we gonna do?

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:09.041
I don't know.

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:18.521
Annie.

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.771
Jack.

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:27.660
Jack.

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:29.569
Look at me. It's okay.

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.248
Ten more steps, remember, Jack?

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:33.361
Stay with me.

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:35.680
Stay with me.

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:37.689
Stay with me.

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.180
Okay?

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:43.340
We've got to go to the river. The river.

01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:44.420
Jack?

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.300
- Get across the border.
- Okay.

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.140
Okay, we're gonna keep going.

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.260
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.420
Okay? Okay.

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:52.760
The river, right?

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:54.020
Okay, stay with me, okay?

01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:55.540
- Okay, come on.
- Okay?

01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:57.085
- Okay.
- Come on.

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:13.844
My feet are...

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:21.885
There's the river.

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.291
Go ahead.

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:08.860
Get in there, go.

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:10.086
Go, go, go.

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:16.460
- What do we do?
- Stay there.

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:18.420
I'm gonna go down to the river,
and I'm gonna get a boat.

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:19.980
Okay, just wait right here.

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.081
Okay.

01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:58.850
Boat?

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:04.220
I'll give you... give you the watch.
Watch for the boat.

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.980
Here look, look...

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:09.700
Gold watch, here.
Look, look, look. For the boat.

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:10.801
A thousand dollars.

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:16.844
- Shoe...
- You want the shoes?

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:20.540
Shoe.

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:21.641
Look...

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:42.088
Okay, hold on.

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:44.041
Okay.

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.165
Hold on.

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:01.645
Okay?

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:03.780
Okay.

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:08.380
What?

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.209
Where?

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.089
Okay, we're fine here for a second.

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.121
Mommy.

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.540
Daddy!

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:35.460
- Daddy!
- Lucy!

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:36.686
Lucy!

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.260
Dad, look out!

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:45.889
Hey!

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.260
Daddy!

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:51.860
No! No!

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:56.442
Let her go! Let her go!

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:05.180
No! No!

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:08.500
Please! She's just a kid, stop!
Please! Please!

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:11.126
Just let her go! Please! Please!

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:16.484
No!

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:21.447
No! No! No! No!

01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:25.060
No! No!

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.527
Please! Please! Stop!

01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:30.020
Lucy! Lucy!

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:32.060
Just do it! Just do it!

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:45.450
Lucy, I'm right here, I'm right here.

01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:49.540
We're together! I love you!

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:51.820
Daddy!

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:53.660
It's okay. Do it.

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:56.161
No, Daddy! We need you.

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:03.963
No!

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:35.780
Where's the Beeze?

01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:37.041
I'll go get her.

01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:40.647
I'm sorry, Daddy!

01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:44.820
You did great!
It's okay, it's all right.

01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:48.260
It's okay. It's okay.

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.540
All right.

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:51.165
Mommy.

01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:57.886
All right. Okay.

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:00.521
Come here.

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:53.820
Shit!

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.684
They're gonna see us, Jack!

01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:59.090
Get down, get down.

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.820
Get down and stay quiet.

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.847
Vietnam, there's Vietnam.

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:12.086
Keep rowing.

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:20.880
Come on!

01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:34.060
Stop! Do not continue!

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:37.209
You do not have permission
to enter Vietnam!

01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:38.940
Turn your boat around!

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.700
Stop! Do not shoot!

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:43.260
Do not shoot!

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:45.860
You do not have permission
to enter Vietnam!

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:48.725
We're seeking asylum!
We're just a family!

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:50.700
We need help!

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:52.802
Stop! Do not continue!

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:56.220
- You do not have...
- Don't shoot! Do not shoot!

01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.687
We're bringing my family into Vietnam!

01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:02.220
Do not proceed any further.

01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:03.980
- Do not shoot!
- Turn your boat around.

01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:07.220
We're not turning around. Do not shoot!

01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:08.731
Don't shoot!

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:12.100
Lower your weapon.

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:15.180
This boat is now in Vietnamese waters.

01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:18.460
If you shoot,
we will consider this an act of war!

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:22.167
This boat is now in Vietnam!
Lower your weapon!

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:50.169
Okay, it's over.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.001
Okay.

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:23.804
Daddy, will you tell me
the story about how I was born?

01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:27.521
Okay.

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:31.420
Well, I thought it would be a good idea

01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:35.220
to videotape your mom giving birth.

01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.846
I was saying,
"Push harder, push harder,"

01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:41.220
and she gave me a look, like...

01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:43.500
You know that look Mommy gives, like...

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:45.648
"You're in big trouble."

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:47.420
And then I came out?

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:50.180
Then you came out, yep.

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:51.700
And then they spanked me?

01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:55.540
Well, they spank all little babies
'cause they're trying to get them to cry.

01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:58.900
- But she didn't?
- She wasn't crying.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.780
So they spanked you again.
And they spanked her again.

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:05.100
Then they tried again.

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:07.362
- But I wasn't breathing.
- That's right.

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:13.368
Then more doctors came rushing in,
and they brought in more machines and...

01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:18.008
The nurse said, "You might want
to turn that video camera off."

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:25.420
And then your Dad looked at me and said,

01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:26.940
"You need to talk to her.

01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:30.540
You need to tell her to breathe
because she knows your voice."

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:32.100
"Loud."

01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:35.140
- "Say it to her."
- So I started yelling,

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.900
"Breathe, Lucy.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.765
"Breathe, little Lucy, please."

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:42.780
And then I did?

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:44.291
- Yeah.
- And then you did.

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:46.740
Then I brought you over to Mommy,

01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:49.060
and she held you
for the first time, and I said,

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:51.811
"Don't worry little Lucy, you're okay.

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:53.971
We're gonna keep you safe."

01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:07.690
Don't be sad, Daddy.

01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:09.370
I'm not sad.

01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:12.808
I'm happy.

01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:17.403
Really happy.
