00:00.043 --> 00:02.132
Previous on "Below Deck Med"...

00:02.176 --> 00:03.960
- Did anyone order a beer?

00:04.004 --> 00:05.701
I have the best deck crew.

00:05.744 --> 00:07.485
Willkommen zum Oktoberfest!

00:07.529 --> 00:09.357
Look at the flow!

00:09.400 --> 00:11.054
Lexi was starting
our room earlier.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.621
-She never came back, so...
-Okay.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.231
Like the cleaners and
everything are still in there.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.059
-And there's no towels.
-There isn't?

00:16.103 --> 00:17.669
These guys drinks
are empty.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.106
Can we get some plates?

00:19.149 --> 00:20.194
Oh my God.

00:24.154 --> 00:25.286
Need some help
in the interior?

00:25.329 --> 00:27.070
I got this girl
in quarantine,

00:27.114 --> 00:28.463
We have an extra bed.

00:28.506 --> 00:30.030
I'm willing to give her
a shot for the charter.

00:30.073 --> 00:31.292
I'm adding someone.

00:31.335 --> 00:32.728
She is a deck stew,

00:32.771 --> 00:34.425
but she's coming out
to help interior.

00:37.211 --> 00:38.951
You're not, no.

00:38.995 --> 00:40.997
David goes in
with the boys,

00:41.041 --> 00:42.607
and then Mat and her.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.653
You just have to tell her
we only have a co-ed cabin.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.394
What did he mean he had
no-one to mix him a drink?

00:46.437 --> 00:48.048
This morning.

00:48.091 --> 00:49.484
Actually had to make
my own drink this morning.

00:49.527 --> 00:53.575
To be pinpointed out
that your department is failing,

00:53.618 --> 00:56.099
and it really comes
down to one person.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.014
You've been a stewardess
for how long, so

00:58.058 --> 01:00.147
now that we do
have an extra hand,

01:00.190 --> 01:02.149
-there's no excuse.
-Excuse.

01:02.192 --> 01:05.239
So... I don't want
to have ranks anymore.

01:05.282 --> 01:06.544
Okay.

01:25.172 --> 01:28.610
It's just, to me it seems
more laziness than anything.

01:28.653 --> 01:31.482
Whether it is or not, that's
just how it comes across to me.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.571
You've been a stewardess
for how long?

01:33.615 --> 01:35.486
So, it's just
it's not acceptable.

01:35.530 --> 01:39.795
And like you aren't up
to a second stew standard.

01:39.838 --> 01:42.145
Things need to be
done properly and

01:42.189 --> 01:44.669
now that we do have
an extra hand,

01:44.713 --> 01:46.280
-there's no excuse.
-Excuse.

01:46.323 --> 01:49.457
So... I don't want to
have ranks anymore.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.501
Okay.

01:50.545 --> 01:52.764
Um... and... yeah.

01:52.808 --> 01:55.245
I don't know how
this is going to go down,

01:55.289 --> 01:58.030
but... just do things
properly and

01:58.074 --> 01:59.771
we'll just, you know...

01:59.815 --> 02:02.557
-Girl coming?
-She's here.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.645
-That's it.
-Okay.

02:03.688 --> 02:07.083
-Cool. Thanks, Lex.
-Okay.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.696
I don't know where
I put my coffee.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.568
I think that decision
is really idiotic

02:13.611 --> 02:16.701
to demote or to make
everyone even,

02:16.745 --> 02:18.616
it doesn't make any
sense at all.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.357
That's embarrassing.

02:20.401 --> 02:22.533
Hi! Morning!

02:22.577 --> 02:24.187
-Hi, Delaney.
-David.

02:24.231 --> 02:25.406
-Nice to meet you.
-And you.

02:25.449 --> 02:28.104
Cool, I'm going to
go find captain.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.801
Straight up those stairs
and then on your right.

02:29.845 --> 02:31.368
-Thank you so much.
-No worries.

02:31.412 --> 02:33.718
I graduated Berkeley
in Media Studies

02:33.762 --> 02:36.895
which is part psychology which
I thought was super interesting

02:36.939 --> 02:39.246
because I love learning how to
get people to do what I want.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.205
The best thing that happened
because of Berkeley

02:42.249 --> 02:43.902
wasn't actually
school related,

02:43.946 --> 02:46.166
but I joined the sailing team
and I had a really good time.

02:48.429 --> 02:50.300
I saw my "r"s as "w"s.

02:50.344 --> 02:52.346
I was pulled out of class
in second grade

02:52.389 --> 02:55.218
because the realized I had
some sort of speech impediment,

02:55.262 --> 02:58.221
and the would pull me into
the hallway and feed me cheerios

02:58.265 --> 03:00.702
and like work on it
and my second-grade mind

03:00.745 --> 03:02.486
was like, ooh,
if I make this worse,

03:02.530 --> 03:04.706
I get more treats
in the hallway.

03:04.749 --> 03:08.144
So I taught myself to have more
of a speech impediment

03:08.188 --> 03:10.364
to be able to skip
class in second grade.

03:10.407 --> 03:11.800
-Hi, good morning.
-Hi!

03:11.843 --> 03:13.236
-Welcome aboard.
-Thanks.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.586
-Nice to meet you.
-Delaney.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.806
So, I know your CV,

03:17.849 --> 03:20.591
but before this, what
boats have you been on?

03:27.381 --> 03:29.426
Anything from 35 feet
to I think the biggest I did

03:29.470 --> 03:30.645
was 62 feet.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.386
And a deck stew?
You did everything?

03:32.429 --> 03:33.865
Because those small boats,
you have to do everything.

03:33.909 --> 03:36.477
Yeah, but I never really
touched the interior because

03:36.520 --> 03:37.826
it was a lower lever of charter
that we wouldn't do

03:37.869 --> 03:39.654
the beds everyday
or anything like that,

03:39.697 --> 03:42.265
but definitely...

03:42.309 --> 03:44.789
I know you're deck, but
we need the support inside.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.530
Are you willing to do that?

03:46.574 --> 03:48.271
Yeah, I'm willing
to help wherever's needed.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.447
You know, consider with
the pandemic going on,

03:50.491 --> 03:52.188
I can only get two
crew in quarantine,

03:52.232 --> 03:53.929
a chef and a deck stew.

03:53.972 --> 03:56.453
I could see why
the staffing agency

03:56.497 --> 03:59.195
chose someone that had
a stronger deck experience,

03:59.239 --> 04:01.589
because you're dealing
with a lot of equipment.

04:01.632 --> 04:04.287
Whereas in interior,
she can learn laundry,

04:04.331 --> 04:05.419
Everything will
be new, but...

04:05.462 --> 04:06.811
Okay...

04:06.855 --> 04:08.509
You know, think on my
feet kind of thing.

04:08.552 --> 04:10.293
Do you have a problem sharing
a cabin with male crew?

04:10.337 --> 04:12.774
No, I'm like all genders.

04:12.817 --> 04:14.515
Girls and guys make
great roommates, so...

04:14.558 --> 04:15.733
-Right, okay.
-Hello!

04:15.777 --> 04:16.734
Hi!

04:16.778 --> 04:18.214
-Katie.
-Delaney.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.346
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

04:19.389 --> 04:20.738
-Welcome aboard.
-Thank you.

04:20.782 --> 04:23.828
So, I think she was
brought out for deck,

04:23.872 --> 04:26.614
since she has
stew mate on her resume,

04:26.657 --> 04:28.355
-and you needed some help.
-Yeah.

04:28.398 --> 04:29.704
The staffing agency
thought maybe

04:29.747 --> 04:31.836
this could be an opportunity
to help you out.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.751
If she's going to stay,
then this is her role.

04:33.795 --> 04:36.319
It's your decision, okay?

04:36.363 --> 04:39.801
I'm not forcing you to
take on a crew member.

04:39.844 --> 04:42.456
This is completely
up to you.

04:42.499 --> 04:44.414
So I've never been
a stewardess before.

04:45.589 --> 04:46.895
Excited to help.

04:46.938 --> 04:48.592
Everything will be new.

04:48.636 --> 04:49.680
-Um... yeah.
-Yeah.

04:49.724 --> 04:50.899
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.509
-100%?
-Yes.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.642
I'm happy to do it.

04:54.685 --> 04:56.687
Like, clearly I said
the wrong thing.

04:56.731 --> 04:58.385
Okay, cool.

04:58.428 --> 04:59.864
-All right, great. Awesome.
-Sweet.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.779
All right, thank you.
I'll show you around.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.825
Make sure you're back
inside the railing

05:03.868 --> 05:06.915
before releasing any
of those clips.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.351
So this is your
cabin in here.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.440
So you'll be sharing with
Mat.

05:10.484 --> 05:11.572
This is the biggest cabin
in here.

05:11.615 --> 05:12.834
Yeah, it's huge.

05:12.877 --> 05:14.662
Oh, Mat, this
is your roomie.

05:14.705 --> 05:15.924
-Hi.
-Hi, I'm Mat.

05:15.967 --> 05:17.317
-This is Delaney.
-Nice to meet you.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.014
-This is Courtney.
-Hi.

05:19.057 --> 05:22.017
-Courtney, nice to meet you.
-This is our little rock star.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.323
Right on, right on.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.326
-This is Lexi.
-Hi!

05:26.369 --> 05:27.892
This is Delaney.

05:27.936 --> 05:29.938
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

05:31.592 --> 05:33.768
I was very nervous.

05:33.811 --> 05:34.769
Well done, Mzi.

05:34.812 --> 05:35.987
Conquered it.

05:36.031 --> 05:37.554
What size boats
are you used to?

05:37.598 --> 05:39.991
I worked on 36 meter
as the mate.

05:40.035 --> 05:41.776
So this is the biggest.

05:41.819 --> 05:44.648
-Yeah.
-Okay.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.476
And we have a big jacuzzi.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.522
Do you guys have to drain
part of it when you move?

05:48.565 --> 05:50.480
The engineers normally
take care of it.

05:51.525 --> 05:52.917
Okay.

05:52.961 --> 05:54.484
That's just, I'm used
to deck crew.

05:54.528 --> 05:56.051
What am I supposed to do,
drain the hot tub?

05:56.094 --> 05:59.402
Well, you're a stewardess now.

05:59.446 --> 06:00.403
Morning.

06:00.447 --> 06:01.622
So we got our extra crew member.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.450
She's not really interior.

06:03.493 --> 06:06.322
So she's more deck.
She's been running boats.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.368
-She runs charter boats.
-Yeah.

06:08.411 --> 06:09.543
Has she done any stew work?

06:09.586 --> 06:10.805
-No.
-Ever?

06:10.848 --> 06:12.415
Apparently not.

06:12.459 --> 06:13.416
Ah.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.765
Okay.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.376
If she has time and
wants to come outside,

06:16.419 --> 06:17.377
she's more than
welcome to.

06:17.420 --> 06:18.378
All right, cool.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.467
Hi. Nice to meet you.

06:20.510 --> 06:21.816
-Mzi.
-Great.

06:21.859 --> 06:24.862
Delaney.
Delaney.

06:33.784 --> 06:35.046
Chef?

06:35.090 --> 06:36.091
What?

06:36.134 --> 06:37.832
What are you doing for lunch?

06:37.875 --> 06:39.486
I'm going to have everything
deconstructed, kind of,

06:39.529 --> 06:40.661
for these crazies.

06:40.704 --> 06:42.053
Gluten free,
dairy free, keto.

06:42.097 --> 06:44.447
I've seen a lot of
hairy preference sheets,

06:44.491 --> 06:46.144
but you read these and
you're overwhelmed.

06:46.188 --> 06:48.451
Don't eat corn,
gluten-free or high carb.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.148
Eat dairy-free keto.

06:50.192 --> 06:52.542
They've listed enough
sh-- for, like,

06:52.586 --> 06:54.544
a whole month of chartering.

06:54.588 --> 06:57.678
They really ----ed me
on the preference list.

07:03.684 --> 07:04.859
What's her name?

07:04.902 --> 07:06.730
Delaney.

07:06.774 --> 07:07.992
Is there anything
you want to talk about?

07:08.036 --> 07:09.559
Yeah, I'm, just frustrated.

07:09.603 --> 07:10.821
By the whole thing.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.434
I'm just breaking my
back for no reason.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.087
But you're not, like...

07:16.131 --> 07:17.437
You're a ----ing good stew.

07:22.616 --> 07:26.097
Like, I would be
----ed without you.

07:26.141 --> 07:28.709
Like, I've spoke to Lexi,
I'm like I made the decision

07:28.752 --> 07:30.450
to make everybody equal.

07:30.493 --> 07:31.842
She knows she's
on her last warning.

07:31.886 --> 07:33.931
So if anything happens,
there's no...

07:33.975 --> 07:36.499
There's no room for
any of that.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.762
I could've been given
a sh-- green stew

07:38.806 --> 07:41.069
and I got you, you know?

07:41.112 --> 07:42.679
-Who saw her?
-Have you not seen her?

07:42.723 --> 07:43.811
-We all met her, mate.
-I haven't met her.

07:45.029 --> 07:47.510
Dave...

07:47.554 --> 07:48.903
I think Dave could do
really well

07:48.946 --> 07:50.600
with some new blood on the boat.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.041
Who knows?

07:58.565 --> 07:59.957
I'm sure it begins
with an "A".

08:00.001 --> 08:02.090
Courtney, Courtney,
Courtney, Delaney.

08:02.133 --> 08:03.744
-Delaney?
-Delaney, yeah.

08:03.787 --> 08:05.963
Wow, I was so wrong
on Andrea.

08:07.922 --> 08:09.619
All right, let's set
at the table.

08:09.663 --> 08:10.707
Set the table? All right.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.753
-Hi. Malia.
-Delaney.

08:12.796 --> 08:14.015
Delaney, nice to meet you.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.669
-Welcome aboard.
-Thank you.

08:15.712 --> 08:18.672
I feel like we've all
been kind of demoted.

08:18.715 --> 08:20.630
But Katie gets to
keep her title,

08:20.674 --> 08:21.936
so if you're making
everyone even,

08:21.979 --> 08:22.937
shouldn't we all
be even?

08:22.980 --> 08:24.591
Lead by example, right?

08:24.634 --> 08:26.810
Eight women, woo.
This is going to be a charter.

08:26.854 --> 08:28.203
Okay, so...

08:30.727 --> 08:32.076
Okay, cool.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.078
To me, if I was Delaney,
I would have come on,

08:34.122 --> 08:37.038
I'd be like, oh, sweet,
this isn't my gig, I'm out.

08:37.081 --> 08:38.822
'Cause it's not your job,
it's two different jobs.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.128
Just because it's on a yacht

08:40.171 --> 08:42.565
does not mean
it's the same job.

08:42.609 --> 08:44.959
With guest clothes,
quick wash cold,

08:45.002 --> 08:46.613
just in case it's
a weird fabric.

08:46.656 --> 08:47.962
And then always hang dry.

08:48.005 --> 08:50.312
Alcohol and cleaning
products over here.

08:50.355 --> 08:52.619
You just obviously wash all
the white towels together.

08:52.662 --> 08:54.142
We just iron them all.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.926
I mean, I do my own laundry
at home,

08:55.970 --> 08:57.058
it's not like
I don't do laundry.

08:58.842 --> 09:00.235
I'm not an idiot,
I'll figure it out.

09:03.107 --> 09:06.589
All crew, all crew,
provisions are here.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.025
Oh, provisions, okay.

09:11.202 --> 09:14.205
I got one more to do,
then I'm going out there.

09:19.210 --> 09:20.821
Holy sh--, that's heavy.

09:23.258 --> 09:25.869
Mat, Mat, I think
I have you cake.

09:25.913 --> 09:27.654
Thank you.

09:27.697 --> 09:29.046
-I'm Delaney, by the way.
-Delaney, I'm Lloyd.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.700
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.223
All crew, all crew,
please get into your whites

09:32.267 --> 09:34.269
<i>and let's meet on the dock
in 30 minutes.</i>

09:34.312 --> 09:36.097
This is a tight fit.

09:38.099 --> 09:39.187
Okay.

09:39.230 --> 09:40.275
Careful going
into your room.

09:40.318 --> 09:41.581
-What?
-Cabin-mate's in.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.931
Maybe don't barge.

09:43.974 --> 09:45.106
Hey.

09:45.149 --> 09:47.108
Curious on which
belt I should use.

09:47.151 --> 09:49.023
No belt. You're wearing
black shoes.

09:49.066 --> 09:50.633
Okay.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.287
Are we ready?
This all women's charter.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.077
Toes on the line.

10:00.121 --> 10:01.209
Look at our boat.

10:01.252 --> 10:02.253
It's so pretty.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.607
Coming up...

10:09.260 --> 10:11.219
I burned the
out of my finger.

10:11.262 --> 10:12.873
Holy sh--.

10:16.441 --> 10:18.356
Look at our boat!

10:18.400 --> 10:19.749
Its so pretty.

10:22.186 --> 10:23.797
-Hello!
-Hi, Sandy.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.363
-Nice to meet you, welcome.
-I'm a hugger.

10:25.407 --> 10:26.756
Oh, you're a hugger?

10:26.800 --> 10:27.757
-What's your name?
-Delaney.

10:27.801 --> 10:28.758
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.760
-Mzi?
-Mzi, yeah.

10:30.804 --> 10:32.196
Niki, nice to meet you.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.807
-Are you the chef?
-I am.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.853
Welcome aboard Lady Michelle,

10:36.897 --> 10:38.638
and our chief stew Katie
can show you around.

10:38.681 --> 10:41.031
And then we're going to
take off to your destination.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.859
We're excited!

10:43.860 --> 10:45.340
Welcome on board.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.299
-Welcome on board. Hot towel?
-Thank you.

10:48.343 --> 10:49.823
Dear God.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.259
So sorry about
my luggage.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.828
I like her style.

10:54.871 --> 10:57.265
If you follow me, we'll do
a little tour of the boat.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.875
So this is obviously
the main deck aft.

11:00.442 --> 11:01.443
Do that first, okay.

11:01.486 --> 11:03.097
This is our sun deck.

11:03.140 --> 11:06.056
We do have a massive jacuzzi
up here.

11:07.971 --> 11:09.712
I mean, we could put
on you so you're fine.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.453
We'll probably need it.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.762
So then we've got the nice
little sunbathey

11:15.805 --> 11:16.893
-loungey area.
-It's so pretty!

11:16.937 --> 11:18.373
Just let your
vagina hang out.

11:23.465 --> 11:26.250
Hello. I hope you're
prepared for some guests.

11:26.294 --> 11:27.730
Oh, I'm so ready.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.471
I'll do family style
lunch at first

11:29.514 --> 11:31.212
because there's so many
different like and dislikes.

11:31.255 --> 11:33.127
Now the pressure's on.

11:33.170 --> 11:35.346
Oh, man.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.000
-All good?
-Good, yes.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.439
Can you flip it
to the back?

11:44.094 --> 11:45.443
Oh, so you don't
even clip it.

11:45.487 --> 11:47.271
<i>David, meet me on
the main deck aft.</i>

11:47.315 --> 11:48.272
On my way.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.361
Oh my God.

11:50.405 --> 11:52.102
I am not currently
in a relationship.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.152
Here goes.

11:58.195 --> 12:00.371
-Can I ask for a drink?
-What would you like?

12:00.415 --> 12:03.374
I like bourbon, tequila,
everything else.

12:03.418 --> 12:04.375
I'll have something
coming up for you.

12:04.419 --> 12:05.899
Okay, I'd love that.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.990
So if you look here, see how
the wind is pushing us here?

12:10.033 --> 12:10.991
Yeah.

12:11.034 --> 12:12.427
And you look at a flag,

12:12.470 --> 12:14.211
so we're going to be
blown to starboard.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.083
Okay, you can start
releasing lines.

12:16.126 --> 12:18.041
So when I do that,
my arms jiggle.

12:22.263 --> 12:23.873
Port, straight back
is on board.

12:23.917 --> 12:25.266
Standing by for the bow.

12:25.309 --> 12:27.007
Port bow line aboard.

12:29.923 --> 12:32.142
10 feet to
starboard dolphin.

12:35.493 --> 12:36.930
Everybody's like, oh...

12:38.322 --> 12:40.194
It's clear to swing
stern to port.

12:40.237 --> 12:41.543
Nicely done.

12:41.586 --> 12:43.066
How about this?

12:47.331 --> 12:48.332
You sir, can go down.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.164
Hey, no worries.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.557
You have enough space?

12:55.600 --> 12:57.211
Oh, I... these cabins are huge!

12:57.254 --> 12:58.473
All right.

12:58.516 --> 12:59.866
Biggest cabin
I've ever been in.

12:59.909 --> 13:02.477
Who wants a twerk session?

13:02.520 --> 13:04.131
Who wants his food?

13:04.174 --> 13:05.436
I want to see that twerk.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.134
Which one do you want
to see twerk?

13:07.177 --> 13:08.613
She's wearing like a
leopard printy thing.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.920
Oh yeah, oh yeah,
oh yeah, oh yeah.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.574
The jumpsuit type
thing with the...

13:12.617 --> 13:15.185
large... I was just
flabbergasted.

13:15.229 --> 13:17.361
Yeah, so was I.

13:17.405 --> 13:18.623
Really?

13:18.667 --> 13:19.842
Yeah.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.365
Her personality was
just...

13:22.497 --> 13:24.151
Who did you fancy?

13:24.194 --> 13:25.979
I think the prettiest
one was the lady wearing white.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.632
Primary.

13:27.676 --> 13:30.026
Is that Bailey? Don't know why
I remembered her name.

13:33.638 --> 13:35.379
I don't know why
I remember her name.

13:35.423 --> 13:37.251
Is it Bailey? Yeah.
The one in the white?

13:37.294 --> 13:38.513
Let's prep this
meet, boys.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.341
She's got a really
good Instagram.

13:45.607 --> 13:47.391
This is PTA meeting.

13:47.435 --> 13:49.002
She's gonna...

13:49.959 --> 13:51.656
Oh my God.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.572
Maybe we don't lean all the way
over whilst we're moving.

13:54.616 --> 13:57.532
Um, wait, can you
do this when we stop?

13:57.575 --> 13:59.142
Oh, yeah.

13:59.186 --> 14:00.578
Just in case.
I don't want you to fall.

14:00.622 --> 14:02.058
I asked they said
we could.

14:02.102 --> 14:05.670
Okay. Maybe just not
all the way over.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.542
I mean, I like a good time,

14:07.585 --> 14:10.110
but nobody can die today
from twerking.

14:10.153 --> 14:12.460
As soon as we stop,
you can twerk off the side.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.070
I was just joking.

14:15.202 --> 14:16.420
Ow.

14:20.729 --> 14:23.253
I would like to
have another.

14:23.297 --> 14:24.951
-You want another one?
-Sure.

14:29.477 --> 14:30.565
Hello?

14:30.608 --> 14:31.653
Hi.

14:33.437 --> 14:34.699
It's hectic.

14:34.743 --> 14:36.266
If any point you're
not into this,

14:36.310 --> 14:37.528
I don't know what
you've been told.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.052
Like I had interviewed
as a deck hand

14:39.095 --> 14:40.575
my entire CV is deckhand.

14:40.618 --> 14:43.273
I didn't know there was
any stewardess anything.

14:43.317 --> 14:45.406
I just want you guys
to know--

14:45.449 --> 14:48.235
No, no, I know you're green,
but I also understand

14:48.278 --> 14:49.236
that situation, that's
annoying for you.

14:49.279 --> 14:50.715
I'd be pissed.

14:50.759 --> 14:53.196
Like, this is the situation
that we're in,

14:53.240 --> 14:55.155
and, you know? So...
- Yeah.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.984
If you feel like this is just
not for you, be honest with me.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.594
I will not take it
personally.

14:59.637 --> 15:02.292
I'm super happy to do whatever
the boat needs me to do.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.120
That's just what charter is.

15:04.164 --> 15:06.383
Like, if she is going to try,
then I can try.

15:06.427 --> 15:09.691
Happiness is what
we're about.

15:12.085 --> 15:14.304
Captain Sandy,
standing by for the anchor.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.002
Anchor down.

15:20.093 --> 15:22.573
Holding at a long stay
to nine o'clock.

15:22.617 --> 15:23.618
All right, that's good.

15:23.661 --> 15:24.662
-Well done.
-Thank you.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.099
Getting used to it.

15:26.142 --> 15:27.230
Do you wanna take
a two hour break?

15:27.274 --> 15:28.623
Okay, yeah.

15:28.666 --> 15:31.191
I'm gonna have you
on breakfast again.

15:31.234 --> 15:32.975
So, obviously with last
trip, we know what happened

15:33.019 --> 15:34.107
with breakfast stuff.

15:34.150 --> 15:36.109
Hopefully we'll get it right,

15:36.152 --> 15:37.980
and then Court on
lates again...

15:38.024 --> 15:40.113
Um... yeah.

15:40.156 --> 15:41.549
Okay.

15:41.592 --> 15:43.116
-Yeah?
-Okay.

15:43.159 --> 15:44.813
-All righty.
-Cool.

15:47.207 --> 15:51.080
I think giving me
back-to-back breakfast shifts,

15:51.124 --> 15:53.343
I think that's utter BS.

15:53.387 --> 15:55.563
Oh, I feel sorry for Delaney.
She has no idea.

15:59.741 --> 16:02.091
If you guys wanna start, like,
taking a seat and stuff...

16:02.135 --> 16:03.440
Yeah, I'll load this.

16:03.484 --> 16:05.312
Do you wanna grab
a rail just for here?

16:05.355 --> 16:08.184
Deconstructed BLAT...
bacon, lettuce, avocado, tomato.

16:08.228 --> 16:10.578
These preferences are insane.

16:10.621 --> 16:12.493
Balsamic ranch?

16:12.536 --> 16:15.539
Yep, that's just plain greens,
because some of them like that.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.628
Family-style,
you can deconstruct it,

16:17.672 --> 16:20.718
you can have any combination
you want, tick all the boxes.

16:20.762 --> 16:23.243
Arugula with quinoa.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.244
None of this is
dairy-free, obviously.

16:24.287 --> 16:25.462
Nope.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.160
-And this is gluten-free?
-Yep.

16:27.203 --> 16:29.205
They did not call each other
and think, all right,

16:29.249 --> 16:31.860
what could we all eat together
that we'd all enjoy.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.254
That was not done
before this girls' trip.

16:34.297 --> 16:35.733
This is the weirdest group.

16:35.777 --> 16:38.084
-That is quinoa.
-It's a carb, she can't have it.

16:39.737 --> 16:42.653
So, we have mini
creamy tomato spicy soup.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.655
-The tomato soup is great.
-Mm-hmm.

16:44.699 --> 16:46.570
Local whitefish,
cucumber salsa.

16:46.614 --> 16:49.704
Okay, we have a local
sarkina with a cucumber salsa.

16:49.747 --> 16:51.532
He's making great decisions,

16:51.575 --> 16:55.449
doing family-style,
because y'all are so difficult.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.103
So good.

16:57.146 --> 16:58.539
Will you please tell
the chef the food is great?

16:58.582 --> 17:00.323
-We love it!
-We will.

17:00.367 --> 17:01.455
This, we love.

17:02.891 --> 17:04.588
-Really?
-Yeah.

17:04.632 --> 17:06.895
I wanna get out on the water
while it's, like, sunny.

17:06.938 --> 17:08.549
<i>Delaney, Katie.</i>

17:08.592 --> 17:10.290
<i>Can you meet me in
the bridge deck pant?</i>

17:11.813 --> 17:14.076
but, like, I mean it would
be good to have you up here

17:14.120 --> 17:16.861
a little bit as well, so you're
not just stuck down there.

17:16.905 --> 17:18.515
Lexi will be around,
it'll be more like

17:18.559 --> 17:20.387
helping her with,
like, cleaning pantry.

17:20.430 --> 17:21.779
-Okay.
-All right.

17:21.823 --> 17:23.390
I'll be down there.

17:24.391 --> 17:25.479
-Hey, ladies?
-Hi.

17:25.522 --> 17:27.089
What would you like to do first?

17:27.133 --> 17:28.699
-We want it all.
-You want it all?

17:28.743 --> 17:30.266
-We want... yeah.
-Jet ski.

17:31.267 --> 17:32.834
Yes, it does, actually.

17:36.316 --> 17:37.795
Having attractive women
on board makes

17:37.839 --> 17:39.841
the working situation a
little easier at times.

17:39.884 --> 17:41.756
But these ladies wanna
get involved in everything

17:41.799 --> 17:43.714
and anything that they can,
so I feel like you have to be

17:43.758 --> 17:45.673
a lot more focused when
there's so much going,

17:45.716 --> 17:48.241
just because something
can go wrong so easily.

17:48.284 --> 17:49.329
-Whoa!
-Yeah, it's quite wobbly.

17:49.372 --> 17:50.808
-What!
-Ugh!

17:57.380 --> 17:59.252
You all right, Bailey?

17:59.295 --> 18:00.949
Do you want a drink?
What would you like?

18:00.992 --> 18:03.299
I need a lot of drinks.

18:03.343 --> 18:07.129
Seafood and chicken,
roasted pureed squash.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.436
Ugh, they're all so different.

18:13.657 --> 18:15.920
Oh, my gosh, it's already 4:00?

18:24.451 --> 18:25.669
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

18:26.627 --> 18:27.584
Whoa!

18:27.628 --> 18:29.499
Ow

18:29.543 --> 18:33.764
Oh!

18:38.682 --> 18:41.511
Oh! Oh! Oh!

18:51.086 --> 18:52.392
Holy

19:03.707 --> 19:07.058
Oh! Ow, ow, ow.

19:07.102 --> 19:09.409
Oh

19:09.452 --> 19:11.062
This charter, with all
these women

19:11.106 --> 19:12.673
and all these
different preference lists

19:12.716 --> 19:14.414
would be hard enough
with two hands,

19:14.457 --> 19:16.242
and now I only
have one good one.

19:16.285 --> 19:18.418
Captain, Captain, can
you come to the galley

19:18.461 --> 19:19.680
when you have a chance?

19:19.723 --> 19:21.943
I'm on my way.

19:21.986 --> 19:23.771
-Yeah, of course, of course.
-Yeah, that was great.

19:23.814 --> 19:24.989
Hey.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.295
Burned my finger pretty bad.

19:26.339 --> 19:27.427
You burned yourself?

19:27.470 --> 19:28.950
Holy

19:28.993 --> 19:29.994
-Yeah.
-Okay.

19:30.038 --> 19:31.387
I mean, that's pretty bad.

19:31.431 --> 19:32.562
We gotta get that
taken care of.

19:32.606 --> 19:33.955
-Ah!
-Yeah, okay.

19:33.998 --> 19:36.087
Oh, Ugh.

19:36.131 --> 19:37.611
I think he had iodine on it,

19:37.654 --> 19:39.308
but that was just
his burnt skin.

19:39.352 --> 19:41.267
Ugh.

19:41.310 --> 19:43.573
I'm gonna see if I can't get
the doctor to come to the boat.

19:45.706 --> 19:46.924
I know, I know.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.448
-I hurt my knee last night.
-Okay.

19:48.491 --> 19:50.841
I don't feel like
I can do this properly.

19:50.885 --> 19:52.321
It's a pretty bad burn.

19:52.365 --> 19:53.801
I'm concerned
I may lose the chef.

19:53.844 --> 19:55.672
Hi, Dr. Tea, it's Captain Sandy.

19:55.716 --> 19:57.021
<i>Hi, Captain.</i>

19:57.065 --> 19:58.806
My chef just burned
his hand really bad,

19:58.849 --> 20:00.634
and we're hoping that
you could come out to the boat

20:00.677 --> 20:01.939
and take a look at it.

20:03.724 --> 20:05.073
Okay.

20:13.647 --> 20:14.604
-Mathew?
-Yeah.

20:14.648 --> 20:15.823
Doctor's on his way.

20:18.129 --> 20:19.696
Sh--.

20:29.706 --> 20:30.925
That's where I meant to go.

20:30.968 --> 20:32.579
Whoa!

20:34.537 --> 20:36.626
So, Mat's burned
his fingers pretty badly.

20:36.670 --> 20:38.541
Oh, no, is he okay?

20:38.585 --> 20:40.717
The doctor's on their way.

20:40.761 --> 20:42.153
-Are you okay?
-Pretty bad.

20:42.197 --> 20:45.200
-Oh!
-Yeah.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.507
Do you wanna come up and ask
them what they'd like to drink?

20:47.550 --> 20:49.596
-I'm shy.
-They're actually really chill.

20:52.729 --> 20:53.904
I'm used to, like,
boats where, like, the deckhands

20:53.948 --> 20:55.515
do not talk to the guests.

20:55.558 --> 20:56.864
No, you got to
break out of that.

20:56.907 --> 20:59.345
Someone please help us!

20:59.388 --> 21:01.390
-Hey!
-Hey.

21:02.870 --> 21:03.827
Pretty busy.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.394
Hi, ladies.

21:07.918 --> 21:08.919
Can I bring anyone a drink?

21:11.226 --> 21:12.706
Tequila shot?

21:12.749 --> 21:14.708
All right, all right,
turn this off, or what?

21:14.751 --> 21:18.581
Turn that on, fire that one...
ow, ow, ow.

21:20.627 --> 21:21.932
Lexi, I'm good to go, right?

21:21.976 --> 21:24.457
-Yes, just go up.
-Thank you.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.241
All right, ladies,
I've brought the fun.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.982
Thank you.

21:28.025 --> 21:29.723
-Okay.
-This was for you, right?

21:30.767 --> 21:31.768
Yes, of course.

21:31.812 --> 21:32.856
Pop the chicken in the oven.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.858
I got the brown rice in the pan.

21:36.120 --> 21:39.863
-I see the vessel.
-Copy for galley.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.604
Just watch your head,
watch your head.

21:41.648 --> 21:42.953
Where do I get
the fancy gloves from?

21:42.997 --> 21:44.390
Right here, let me show you.

21:44.433 --> 21:45.913
Is this like a
moment of passage, or...

21:45.956 --> 21:49.177
This is the moment.
You are now a stewardess.

21:49.220 --> 21:51.614
Hello, once again.
What happened?

21:53.486 --> 21:54.791
The middle one's the worst.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.793
I grabbed a pan on fire
and put it in the sink,

21:56.837 --> 21:58.969
and put out the flame.

21:59.013 --> 22:01.668
I got dinner in an hour and
a half, so what do you think?

22:02.973 --> 22:04.671
Oof.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.847
I cannot let this end my season.

22:06.890 --> 22:10.111
I've come too far, I need to
----ing talk myself off a ledge.

22:12.679 --> 22:14.158
...so you can put it after
the dinner as well.

22:14.202 --> 22:15.116
Yeah, and then I can
go straight to work.

22:15.159 --> 22:16.204
Okay.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.514
<i>Delaney, Delaney, Katie.</i>

22:21.557 --> 22:22.993
Do you wanna go eat dinner
and get changed?

22:23.037 --> 22:24.908
<i>-Sure.</i>
-Oh, man.

22:24.952 --> 22:26.257
Bye.

22:26.301 --> 22:28.129
Hopefully we won't see you soon.

22:31.698 --> 22:32.873
All right, nice job, guys.

22:32.916 --> 22:35.484
Mat's hand is burnt,

22:35.528 --> 22:37.530
so he's gonna need some
help in the galley.

22:37.573 --> 22:38.835
So, we'll go get changed.

22:38.879 --> 22:40.794
Round up the hos, let's change.

22:40.837 --> 22:43.840
This is what I pulled.
I tried to, like, make it...

22:43.884 --> 22:45.015
-Yeah.
-Pink and white-ish.

22:45.059 --> 22:47.061
Yeah, no, I like it.

22:49.977 --> 22:51.544
Gotta get in the zone, buddy.

22:52.675 --> 22:54.895
This is wonderful.
Thank you.

22:54.938 --> 22:56.200
You're welcome.

22:56.244 --> 22:58.638
-Oh, hey.
-Ooh, look at you.

23:05.035 --> 23:06.863
Yeah.

23:09.126 --> 23:10.301
Where you gonna sit?

23:10.345 --> 23:12.129
Ah! I'm in pain.

23:12.173 --> 23:13.217
-Need some help?
-Yes, please.

23:13.261 --> 23:15.219
Wash those pans.
Thank you, man.

23:15.263 --> 23:17.178
I'm in ----ing pain.

23:17.221 --> 23:19.136
I worked at this restaurant,
and this lady owned it.

23:19.180 --> 23:22.052
One of the new guys had
a pot of fry oil, hot, hot,

23:22.096 --> 23:25.621
and he spun around, and
it poured all over her arm,

23:25.665 --> 23:28.232
and she just ----ing wrapped
it and went back to work.

23:28.276 --> 23:30.583
Oh, my ----ing finger.

23:30.626 --> 23:32.802
If she could do that,
like, I'll be fine.

23:32.846 --> 23:34.238
Ooh.

23:34.282 --> 23:35.544
I like this décor.

23:35.588 --> 23:36.980
It's classy, it's simple,

23:37.024 --> 23:38.721
it's elegant, it's pink,
just like me.

23:38.765 --> 23:40.201
Individually wrap
these little ones?

23:40.244 --> 23:41.507
Yeah, thank you.

23:41.550 --> 23:42.682
Ow, ow, ow.

23:42.725 --> 23:44.074
Cheers.

23:46.337 --> 23:47.556
She said to go ahead and eat.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.818
Or, like, serve, it's fine.

23:50.385 --> 23:51.734
She'll catch up.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.127
Ooh, are those
bacon-wrapped dates?

23:53.170 --> 23:55.259
Yes, bacon-wrapped dates.

23:58.088 --> 23:59.568
-Whew.
-Oh.

23:59.612 --> 24:01.918
Oh, that smells
freaking naughty.

24:01.962 --> 24:04.921
Yeah, that's gnocchi alfredo,
chicken parmesan... whew.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.706
Here you go.
-Thank you.

24:06.749 --> 24:08.055
-Do you want some more ice?
-Yeah.

24:08.098 --> 24:09.099
There's not that much
in there, but...

24:09.143 --> 24:11.058
There's another ice machine.

24:11.101 --> 24:12.973
The dates are fantastic.

24:13.016 --> 24:14.931
So, we have chicken parmesan...

24:14.975 --> 24:16.106
-Ooh!
-Wow!

24:16.150 --> 24:18.805
And gnocchi alfredo.
-Mm!

24:18.848 --> 24:20.676
A little bit of everything.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.635
Holy crap,
I'm gonna marry the chef.

24:22.678 --> 24:23.984
That's delicious.

24:27.161 --> 24:29.424
[bleep], so nice.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.643
-How we going?
-Good.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.296
There's just this.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.385
Cool, do you wanna show
her turn-downs?

24:34.429 --> 24:35.386
-Okay.
-Thank you.

24:35.430 --> 24:36.387
Cool.

24:36.431 --> 24:37.693
----ing finger, dude.

24:37.737 --> 24:38.955
Where would you like these put?

24:38.999 --> 24:40.609
Is there room on
that shelf over there,

24:40.653 --> 24:44.700
on top of that dehydrator?

24:44.744 --> 24:47.007
Yeah, there's space here now.

24:47.050 --> 24:49.662
Make sure you have
a bathmat, two big towels,

24:49.705 --> 24:52.316
two face towels,
one hand cloth.

24:52.360 --> 24:54.971
I did wake up,
and I had no idea where I was.

24:55.015 --> 24:56.233
And then it came to me,
and I'm like,

24:56.277 --> 25:00.020
oh, I'm on a yacht, bitch.

25:00.063 --> 25:03.153
Oh, come on.

25:03.197 --> 25:04.154
Everyone's loving it.

25:04.198 --> 25:05.808
-Really?
-Yeah.

25:05.852 --> 25:06.983
They're not like, what,
did he burn his finger,

25:07.027 --> 25:08.245
and phone it in for dinner?

25:08.289 --> 25:09.290
-What's dessert?
-The cake.

25:09.333 --> 25:11.031
Oh, yeah.

25:11.074 --> 25:15.818
Thank God I have a store-bought,
because I needed a break.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.690
This looks like sh--.

25:17.733 --> 25:19.343
Everyone's coming, we're gonna
sing "Happy Birthday."

25:19.387 --> 25:20.475
I'm not.

25:24.087 --> 25:25.480
You're both coming.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.917
When you give me that look,
I can't say no.

25:27.961 --> 25:30.006
-What are we doing after dinner?
-I'm swimming ashore.

25:30.050 --> 25:31.660
You gonna get your hair wet?

25:31.704 --> 25:33.444
No, I'm gonna put the hair
on top in the bun,

25:33.488 --> 25:36.970
and I'm gonna swim like that,
and just not get my hair wet.

25:37.013 --> 25:41.061
♪ Happy birthday to you

25:41.104 --> 25:42.236
Oh, no!

25:42.279 --> 25:45.413
♪ Happy birthday, dear...

25:45.456 --> 25:48.851
-Oh, it's too windy!
-Woo!

25:48.895 --> 25:50.418
Yeah, we don't need to spit
on it, it's cool.

25:50.461 --> 25:53.029
Are you sure?

25:53.073 --> 25:54.857
Thank you so much.

25:54.901 --> 25:57.947
It's bad luck if you don't
eat your birthday cake.

25:57.991 --> 26:00.863
Ooh!

26:00.907 --> 26:02.473
Katie, Katie, Sandy.
Please come to the bridge.

26:02.517 --> 26:03.910
<i>On my way.</i>

26:05.868 --> 26:07.783
-I'm sleepy tonight.
-You guys wanna go inside?

26:07.827 --> 26:09.785
-It's been a long day.
-Yeah, we can sit inside.

26:09.829 --> 26:11.047
-It really has.
-Let's go.

26:11.091 --> 26:12.092
I'm so full.
That was so good.

26:12.135 --> 26:13.528
So good.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.269
How many meetings have
we had up here now?

26:15.312 --> 26:17.576
We've had a lot.
It's our meeting spot.

26:17.619 --> 26:19.752
Management just called.

26:19.795 --> 26:24.931
We cannot allow cabin-sharing
between a male and a female.

26:24.974 --> 26:27.716
The liabilities are too high,
and the risk is too much.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.849
Okay.

26:29.892 --> 26:31.502
This vessel has
a management company.

26:31.546 --> 26:33.374
You always have to weigh in
what the management thinks.

26:33.417 --> 26:35.202
I tried to get flag
state to endorse it,

26:35.245 --> 26:36.464
they just got back to me.

26:36.507 --> 26:38.118
It was a time zone difference.

26:38.161 --> 26:40.337
They won't.
It absolutely can't happen.

26:40.381 --> 26:43.079
They cannot share a cabin
unless they're in a couple.

26:43.123 --> 26:45.952
It's very defined.
So, Katie has to deal with this.

26:45.995 --> 26:48.476
That means you have
to move everybody.

26:48.519 --> 26:50.347
She cannot sleep
in his cabin tonight.

26:57.050 --> 26:59.443
Management just called.

26:59.487 --> 27:04.187
We cannot allow cabin-sharing
between a male and a female.

27:04.231 --> 27:06.276
She cannot sleep
in his cabin tonight.

27:08.278 --> 27:11.238
My idea is that the chef
share a cabin with Marten.

27:11.281 --> 27:12.543
Okay.

27:12.587 --> 27:14.110
Since Marten's
the chief officer,

27:14.154 --> 27:15.590
I'm not gonna force him
to share a cabin.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.026
Yeah.

27:17.070 --> 27:19.028
So, we've got a
solution for now.

27:19.072 --> 27:20.987
Then in the morning
we can figure out the rest.

27:21.030 --> 27:22.989
-Okay?
-Yeah.

27:23.032 --> 27:23.990
All right, cool.
Thank you.

27:24.033 --> 27:25.556
Okay, thank you.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.994
I gotta let Marten know
he's gonna have a roommate.

27:28.037 --> 27:30.344
Every single crewmember is
gonna have to shuffle cabins

27:30.387 --> 27:32.651
to make this work.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.217
-Yo.
-What's happening?

27:34.261 --> 27:36.132
You guys can't legally
share a cabin.

27:36.176 --> 27:37.656
What the [bleep]?

27:40.267 --> 27:41.660
We're on charter.

27:41.703 --> 27:43.531
Like, there's not time
for sh-- like that.

27:43.574 --> 27:45.402
I feel like it is
starting to be

27:45.446 --> 27:48.057
more of a hassle than
it is benefit us.

27:48.101 --> 27:50.059
So, this charter
she's in her cabin,

27:56.587 --> 27:58.938
F.

27:58.981 --> 28:01.505
Is it worth switching
six people?

28:01.549 --> 28:03.551
Having David move into
the boys' cabin

28:03.594 --> 28:06.423
and having Delaney come
into Mathew's cabin

28:06.467 --> 28:08.512
was sort of clear,
simple as that.

28:08.556 --> 28:10.253
But now the three girls
are gonna have to go

28:10.297 --> 28:11.690
into the three-bedroom cabin,

28:11.733 --> 28:13.256
I'll move in with Malia,

28:13.300 --> 28:15.258
David would go back
into Mat's cabin,

28:15.302 --> 28:18.174
and then Lloyd and Mzi
move into my cabin.

28:18.218 --> 28:20.089
That's hectic.

28:20.133 --> 28:22.222
The solution is
you're gonna sleep

28:22.265 --> 28:23.702
in Marten's cabin
for the charter.

28:23.745 --> 28:25.399
-Share with Marten.
-Yeah.

28:25.442 --> 28:27.009
-They can't share a cabin.
-At all?

28:27.053 --> 28:28.271
No.

28:28.315 --> 28:29.751
So either three girls
go in there...

28:29.795 --> 28:30.709
-Three girls are gonna be...
-Or she leaves.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.580
Oh, wow.

28:32.623 --> 28:34.277
This is vodka and Sprite.

28:34.321 --> 28:35.626
-Ooh, thank you.
-Oh!

28:37.367 --> 28:40.066
How much pain,
on a scale of one to 10?

28:40.109 --> 28:41.458
Eleven.

28:41.502 --> 28:43.069
Owie.

28:46.420 --> 28:47.769
We've got three trips left.

28:47.813 --> 28:50.163
We can easily do it
with the three of us.

28:50.206 --> 28:52.165
Yeah, the cabin sitch
isn't the most vibey.

28:55.603 --> 28:57.561
-I know, so now I feel bad.
-Yeah.

28:57.605 --> 29:01.565
So, this whole cabin
arrangement can't happen.

29:01.609 --> 29:04.307
This charter, Mat's
gonna share a cabin

29:04.351 --> 29:05.308
with Marten, the chief officer.

29:05.352 --> 29:07.136
Okay.

29:07.180 --> 29:09.095
But then we're gonna have
to come up with a solution.

29:09.138 --> 29:10.749
That's a bummer, though.

29:10.792 --> 29:11.750
That's... obviously
didn't wanna cause more work

29:11.793 --> 29:13.186
than was need be.

29:15.144 --> 29:17.930
I don't know what to do.

29:17.973 --> 29:19.758
me.

29:19.801 --> 29:22.543
Cabin sitch... not ideal.

29:25.502 --> 29:27.156
-What?
-The love potion.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.289
My plan to progress
with Courtney

29:29.332 --> 29:31.247
is legitimately
the love potion...

29:31.291 --> 29:32.596
absolute panty-dropper.

29:32.640 --> 29:36.035
Stop it!

29:36.078 --> 29:37.732
-I gotta get my...
-Cow slippers?

29:37.776 --> 29:39.168
Yeah, my little slippers on.

29:39.212 --> 29:40.604
-I know.
-Yeah.

29:42.345 --> 29:43.564
Sorry to invade
your personal space.

29:43.607 --> 29:45.696
No, all good, man.

29:45.740 --> 29:48.177
How's your first day going?

29:48.221 --> 29:51.354
Not what I expected it would be,

29:51.398 --> 29:53.182
but we're making
the best of it.

29:53.226 --> 29:55.141
Yeah, I saw your
resume said mate/stew.

29:55.184 --> 29:57.143
Once for, like, an 80-foot boat,
and it was a day charter.

29:57.186 --> 29:58.666
So you literally
put out Costco platters

29:58.709 --> 30:00.668
and then handed sodas to people.
Like, it was not...

30:00.711 --> 30:01.669
-Ah.
-This at all.

30:01.712 --> 30:03.366
Yeah.

30:03.410 --> 30:05.760
If you don't understand
the stew side of deck/stew,

30:05.804 --> 30:08.415
then I wouldn't really
put it on my resume.

30:08.458 --> 30:09.720
-Yeah.
-It's not a superyacht at all.

30:09.764 --> 30:11.331
Yeah.

30:17.554 --> 30:18.729
There she is!

30:18.773 --> 30:19.861
Hi!

30:19.905 --> 30:21.776
She comes out of the room.

30:26.085 --> 30:28.261
Put it on, put it on!

30:30.132 --> 30:33.744
Babe, I would love
to give Dave a lap dance!

30:33.788 --> 30:35.137
Come on!

30:35.181 --> 30:36.530
Come on, Dave, come
and take a seat.

30:36.573 --> 30:37.574
Come on, Dave.

30:37.618 --> 30:38.793
You know you like it.

30:38.837 --> 30:39.881
Yeah.

30:39.925 --> 30:41.448
Why don't we close you up there?

30:50.326 --> 30:52.241
Was I afraid of Danielle?

30:55.114 --> 30:56.506
Oh my God.

30:56.550 --> 30:58.421
Yes, I think
any sane person

30:58.465 --> 31:00.554
should be a little
scared of Danielle.

31:00.597 --> 31:02.861
Oh, yeah!

31:05.689 --> 31:07.735
She just looks like
this weird armadillo,

31:07.778 --> 31:09.606
like, giving this,
like, lap dance.

31:09.650 --> 31:11.304
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

31:11.347 --> 31:13.523
Thank you, everyone
that participated.

31:15.699 --> 31:16.918
How you feeling?

31:16.962 --> 31:18.224
I'm all right.

31:18.267 --> 31:19.268
Is it painful now?

31:19.312 --> 31:20.879
Yeah, the middle one's bad.

31:20.922 --> 31:24.099
Ugh, burns suck, dude.

31:24.143 --> 31:25.535
I'm in so much pain right now,

31:25.579 --> 31:29.583
and I'm just upset
about my bunk situation,

31:29.626 --> 31:32.281
and I'm just trying to finish
my days and go to bed.

31:32.325 --> 31:34.109
Thank you for all
your help today.

31:34.153 --> 31:35.371
Yeah, of course.

31:35.415 --> 31:36.590
Hopefully you get some
sleep with that.

31:36.633 --> 31:37.852
Yeah, thanks.

31:38.853 --> 31:39.810
Delaney.

31:39.854 --> 31:41.638
-Hi!
-How you going?

31:41.682 --> 31:42.813
Good.

31:42.857 --> 31:44.728
-All right, bedtime.
-Good night.

31:44.772 --> 31:46.469
You can wrap up, hey?

31:46.513 --> 31:48.384
And then just
come back for 7:30.

31:48.428 --> 31:49.777
Okay.

31:49.820 --> 31:52.345
Lexi will be up,
but just come straight to laund,

31:52.388 --> 31:54.173
turn if there's anything.

31:54.216 --> 31:55.565
Yeah.

32:03.878 --> 32:05.706
-Okay, night.
-Good night.

32:07.490 --> 32:08.752
Morning, sunshine.

32:08.796 --> 32:10.711
-How are you?
-So good.

32:10.754 --> 32:12.278
Are we moving cabins tomorrow?

32:14.454 --> 32:15.672
Did you have a chat
with her tonight?

32:15.716 --> 32:17.283
Yeah, she's cool.
Nice person.

32:17.326 --> 32:18.545
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

32:21.809 --> 32:22.897
Yeah.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.725
Bye.

32:41.916 --> 32:43.352
Are you good?

32:43.396 --> 32:44.527
Yeah.

32:55.843 --> 32:57.888
Oh, this is some nasty weather.

33:00.021 --> 33:01.370
-Ooh.
-Excuse me.

33:01.414 --> 33:02.937
-Ooh, hey, good morning.
-Good morning.

33:07.463 --> 33:09.030
-Hey.
-Hey.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.597
How are you?

33:10.640 --> 33:11.772
Can you teach me how
to fold guest towels?

33:11.815 --> 33:12.991
-No idea.
-Not these two.

33:13.034 --> 33:14.427
-Not these two, but these ones.
-Oh!

33:14.470 --> 33:16.255
Sorry...
these ones, you did correct.

33:16.298 --> 33:19.301
I personally don't have an
issue with changing cabins.

33:19.345 --> 33:21.260
I'll room with her any day.

33:21.303 --> 33:22.826
Like, I don't wanna room with my
chief stew, I'd room with her.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.524
Where do these end up living?

33:24.567 --> 33:26.352
They live in the bridge pantry.

33:26.395 --> 33:27.614
As soon as you
walk up the stairs,

33:27.657 --> 33:28.702
the first cabinet on the left.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.443
-Thank you.
-Yeah, no prob.

33:32.271 --> 33:33.620
-Hey.
-Hi.

33:33.663 --> 33:35.709
-How's this morning going?
-Good.

33:37.450 --> 33:38.538
Are any guests up?

33:38.581 --> 33:39.843
I do not believe so yet.

33:39.887 --> 33:40.888
-Okay.
-Yeah.

33:40.931 --> 33:41.976
-Cool.
-Yeah.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.325
-Sweet.
-Okay.

33:43.369 --> 33:44.805
You think you're gonna sustain?

33:44.848 --> 33:46.502
We'll get there.

33:46.546 --> 33:48.069
Wanna meet in the bridge?

33:48.113 --> 33:51.507
Let's meet in the bridge
for the one millionth time.

33:56.947 --> 34:00.299
My concern is
I don't think she is happy.

34:00.342 --> 34:01.909
I just know if I was her,
like,

34:01.952 --> 34:03.519
she'd just been dealt
a sh-- hand, basically.

34:03.563 --> 34:06.348
Well, here's my feeling.
You wanted someone.

34:06.392 --> 34:07.523
-Mm-hmm.
-Correct?

34:07.567 --> 34:09.438
Yeah.
Like, she's been great.

34:09.482 --> 34:10.831
-It's nothing on her.
-Right.

34:10.874 --> 34:13.007
Like, it's...
my concern is...

34:14.617 --> 34:15.618
Yeah, we have to move
six people.

34:15.662 --> 34:16.706
Yeah.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.012
People aren't happy about it,

34:18.056 --> 34:19.753
people are really
voicing that to me.

34:19.796 --> 34:21.494
You just have to have
a conversation with her

34:21.537 --> 34:22.495
if she wants to stay or go.

34:22.538 --> 34:24.018
And if she wants to stay,

34:24.062 --> 34:26.586
then you have to make
the cabin arrangement movement.

34:26.629 --> 34:27.804
We only have
three charters left...

34:27.848 --> 34:30.677
-Well, two, after this.
-Yeah.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.940
So, the really decision
is up to you and her.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.116
-Cool.

34:35.160 --> 34:36.857
-All right.
-Thank you.

34:36.900 --> 34:37.945
Thank you, Captain Sandy.

34:39.729 --> 34:40.991
Coming up...

34:41.035 --> 34:42.384
Haul the anchor
when you're ready.

34:42.428 --> 34:43.994
Look what's coming right at me.

34:45.692 --> 34:48.477
This is gonna pass,
I promise.

34:48.521 --> 34:50.914
Holy sh--. Ah!

34:55.615 --> 34:57.573
Ow!

34:57.617 --> 34:58.835
Niki?

34:58.879 --> 34:59.836
Who is it?

34:59.880 --> 35:01.751
Hey, sexy mamas.

35:01.795 --> 35:03.101
Oh, yeah.

35:11.805 --> 35:13.459
Your brioche French toast?

35:20.205 --> 35:21.815
Man, it is gnarly.

35:23.860 --> 35:24.818
-Hello? <i>
-Is Lexi there?</i>

35:24.861 --> 35:26.602
Yes, she is.

35:26.646 --> 35:28.691
Hey, you guys, do you wanna
jump into the double cabin?

35:28.735 --> 35:29.736
It's free.

35:29.779 --> 35:31.129
<i>-Sure.</i>
-Thank you.

35:34.871 --> 35:36.612
I smell bacon.

35:36.656 --> 35:39.789
Put the corners in, zip,
and then you shake till...

35:39.833 --> 35:41.008
-Okay.
-You're tired of shaking.

35:41.051 --> 35:42.792
And shake it out.

35:42.836 --> 35:44.098
And then spray the hell out
of it to get the lines out?

35:45.230 --> 35:46.796
Yeah!

35:50.148 --> 35:52.150
Oh, Maureen, you poor thing.

35:52.193 --> 35:53.803
She got shanked.

35:53.847 --> 35:55.892
Yeah, don't know
if we can save her.

35:55.936 --> 35:56.937
Mm.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.199
We might have to get a new one.

35:58.243 --> 36:00.114
-What should we name her?
-Maureen.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.160
-Maureen the Magical Unicorn.
-Yeah!

36:02.203 --> 36:03.161
Maureen's struggling.

36:03.204 --> 36:04.727
She's had a rough go.

36:04.771 --> 36:06.642
I'm gonna try
to patch her really quick.

36:06.686 --> 36:08.078
Poor Maureen.

36:08.122 --> 36:10.080
I think it's time
to say goodbye.

36:10.124 --> 36:11.952
She's done well, though,
considering most inflatables...

36:11.995 --> 36:15.173
Yeah, last, like, one charter.

36:15.216 --> 36:17.087
I feel it's come
to a natural end.

36:18.132 --> 36:19.612
She's had a good season.

36:19.655 --> 36:21.222
She also has another
little hole up here.

36:21.266 --> 36:25.008
Like, she's been
through so much.

36:25.052 --> 36:28.098
Every minute that passes now
is just painful.

36:30.100 --> 36:32.625
I will genuinely miss her.

36:32.668 --> 36:33.843
Ugh...

36:38.239 --> 36:40.154
Ooh, it's cold.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.286
Straighten the chair.

36:41.329 --> 36:42.983
Okay.

36:43.026 --> 36:44.289
-You all right, mate?
-Yeah, good, how are you?

36:44.332 --> 36:45.899
Yeah, good.

36:54.647 --> 36:55.952
I think the anchor's holding.

37:10.967 --> 37:12.055
All right, thank you, darling.

37:12.099 --> 37:13.187
No worries.

37:15.102 --> 37:17.191
I feel way better
about my decisions.

37:18.932 --> 37:20.063
French toast.

37:20.107 --> 37:21.717
-Ooh, yum.
-Gluten-free.

37:21.761 --> 37:22.892
Do you wanna help me?

37:22.936 --> 37:24.067
I mean, I can certainly try.

37:24.111 --> 37:25.286
Do you know how
to work that thing?

37:25.330 --> 37:26.809
Absolutely not.

37:29.334 --> 37:30.813
...the new situation.

37:30.857 --> 37:32.641
-No?
-No.

37:35.078 --> 37:37.255
Yeah, no, you proper
got stung.

37:39.996 --> 37:43.130
-You wanna be roomies?
-We're gonna be roomies.

37:48.831 --> 37:49.876
About what's happening?

37:49.919 --> 37:51.181
Yeah.

37:52.618 --> 37:55.055
It's just this is too much.

37:55.098 --> 37:57.057
I'm just ----ing
over thinking about this.

37:57.100 --> 37:59.320
It's just causing too much
drama, and it's just all...

37:59.364 --> 38:02.018
-Yeah.
-Not worth it.

38:02.062 --> 38:03.150
Yeah.

38:04.804 --> 38:06.849
Yeah. Yeah.

38:11.854 --> 38:13.334
-This is so yummy.
-I know.

38:13.378 --> 38:14.901
-It's delicious.
-I killed it.

38:14.944 --> 38:16.598
I'm just gonna try
and do my best job.

38:16.642 --> 38:17.947
Yeah.

38:17.991 --> 38:19.688
Can you look after
the charter guests?

38:19.732 --> 38:20.776
Okay.

38:20.820 --> 38:21.951
This French toast is amazing.

38:21.995 --> 38:23.170
It's real good.

38:32.266 --> 38:35.138
Holy sh--.

38:37.097 --> 38:40.100
When I get really stressed,
my body feels things so heavily

38:40.143 --> 38:42.189
that it makes me really,
really sick to my gut

38:42.232 --> 38:43.843
that, like, I vomit.

38:43.886 --> 38:46.672
[bleep], I just wanna be
done with this situation.

38:46.715 --> 38:47.890
It's not worth it.

38:47.934 --> 38:49.065
Oh my God.

38:49.109 --> 38:50.893
[bleep], we're not doing it.

38:57.465 --> 38:59.380
Hey.

39:02.209 --> 39:03.993
Do you wanna come up to the
bridge for a second with me?

39:04.037 --> 39:06.082
Sure.

39:06.126 --> 39:07.345
-Okay.
-All right.

39:07.388 --> 39:09.172
-Bye, forever.
-Bye, forever.

39:09.216 --> 39:11.697
I'm, like, very hungover.

39:11.740 --> 39:13.133
Oh!

39:15.396 --> 39:16.702
-Can I see?
-Yeah.

39:16.745 --> 39:19.226
Ooh, yeah.
That needs to be popped.

39:19.269 --> 39:20.967
When you're done with breakfast.

39:22.447 --> 39:26.233
Um, you have been great
since you've been here.

39:26.276 --> 39:28.104
The thing is, like, I was
under the impression

39:28.148 --> 39:29.410
you were a deck stew.

39:29.454 --> 39:32.065
You said on your
CV you've been a stew,

39:32.108 --> 39:34.372
and you haven't
really, you know?

39:34.415 --> 39:36.461
Like, I'm not, like, having
a go at you about that.

39:36.504 --> 39:38.767
It's just, like, people
can say things,

39:38.811 --> 39:40.987
and it's like for me,
do I take that risk

39:41.030 --> 39:44.033
if I know you're not doing
what you actually wanna do.

39:44.077 --> 39:47.863
And, like, now with all these,
like, you know, rules

39:47.907 --> 39:50.431
and, like, regulations,
and it's just for me,

39:50.475 --> 39:53.086
it seems like it's causing
more problems than it's worth.

39:53.129 --> 39:55.305
And I do mean that, like,
as you as a person.

39:55.349 --> 39:57.525
It's just, like,
we cause all this commotion,

39:57.569 --> 39:59.266
we move six people around,

39:59.309 --> 40:01.921
and, like, all this stuff
that's been settled.

40:01.964 --> 40:06.273
And, like, and then,
you know, if you...

40:06.316 --> 40:09.450
Well, I think that's
slightly unfair, to...

40:09.494 --> 40:11.278
This whole situation is unfair.

40:11.321 --> 40:13.933
...assume how I would act
in the future based on

40:13.976 --> 40:16.936
I've only acted and
done my job great so far.

40:16.979 --> 40:20.243
I think that it might be
fairer to give me a chance,

40:20.287 --> 40:22.768
given I've been doing
a really good job so far.

40:36.695 --> 40:39.480
I was under the impression
you were a deck stew.

40:39.524 --> 40:41.482
You said on your CV
you've been a stew,

40:41.526 --> 40:44.833
and it's just for me,
it seems like it's causing

40:44.877 --> 40:46.356
more problems
than it's worth.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.358
Well, I think that's
slightly unfair,

40:48.402 --> 40:51.492
based on I've only acted
and done my job great so far.

40:51.536 --> 40:53.102
You've been great.

40:53.146 --> 40:56.062
I've made the laundry
my little kingdom.

40:56.105 --> 40:57.890
Like, you guys all got to
take a break the other day.

40:57.933 --> 40:59.500
Like, there was
enough getting done that,

40:59.544 --> 41:01.502
like, there was a benefit to me
being here, because everyone...

41:01.546 --> 41:03.504
-Yeah.
-Like, stuff was getting done.

41:03.548 --> 41:07.465
I think that it might be fairer
to give me more of a chance,

41:07.508 --> 41:09.510
given I've been doing
a really good job so far.

41:13.949 --> 41:18.388
Like, but see, now it's just
gonna be, like, awkward, or...

41:18.432 --> 41:20.216
I mean, I know that,
but, like, I'm here with

41:20.260 --> 41:22.131
a positive attitude
and a hard work.

41:22.175 --> 41:23.524
My biggest thing is
trying to understand how

41:23.568 --> 41:25.395
did I not meet
your expectations.

41:25.439 --> 41:29.008
I remember at high school,
if I got a unsatisfactory grade

41:29.051 --> 41:31.358
on something, I would
go to the teacher

41:31.401 --> 41:33.534
and I would convince them to
change my grade after all.

41:33.578 --> 41:35.536
I just don't know why,
like, as a chief stew,

41:35.580 --> 41:40.410
if a stewardess or
a bunny came on board,

41:40.454 --> 41:42.238
if they were helpful
and they made issues

41:42.282 --> 41:43.544
that you had before better...

41:43.588 --> 41:44.632
Look, you can stay till
the end of the charter,

41:44.676 --> 41:46.068
and we'll talk then.

41:46.112 --> 41:47.417
Okay, sure.

41:47.461 --> 41:48.593
-Okay?
-Yeah.

41:48.636 --> 41:50.986
Yeah, I think it
would be quite fair

41:51.030 --> 41:52.553
to have a discussion
at the end of the trip.

41:52.597 --> 41:54.947
Cool.

41:54.990 --> 41:56.688
Should I go continue
doing laundry?

41:56.731 --> 41:59.081
You can take two hours.

41:59.125 --> 42:00.909
-Okay.
-Cool, thank you.

42:00.953 --> 42:02.607
Thank you.

42:06.262 --> 42:08.134
She's right, she did try.

42:08.177 --> 42:09.570
It wasn't like she wasn't
trying or anything like that.

42:09.614 --> 42:12.486
It was just causing
me more stress.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.967
But now we just have
to see where we're at

42:15.010 --> 42:16.229
at the end of the charter.

42:16.272 --> 42:18.710
The situation's so ----ed.

42:18.753 --> 42:20.450
Man, it is gnarly.

42:20.494 --> 42:23.366
I think it's literally supposed
to be like this all day.

42:24.629 --> 42:25.586
Morning.

42:25.630 --> 42:27.414
I mean...

42:33.463 --> 42:35.248
I'm gonna go bed for a little?

42:35.291 --> 42:37.293
I'm gonna take this and go
lay down for, like, an hour.

42:43.343 --> 42:44.387
We are dragging.

42:46.215 --> 42:47.173
-You want us to do that?
-Yeah.

42:47.216 --> 42:48.609
Okay, good.

42:50.176 --> 42:52.004
That looks nasty over there.

42:52.047 --> 42:54.615
Yeah, that's coming
straight for us.

42:54.659 --> 42:56.661
Lloyd, Lloyd, Lexi.

42:59.664 --> 43:02.014
Haul the anchor
when you're ready.

43:02.057 --> 43:03.755
-Ready?
-Yeah, all set.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.323
The minute you see
the anchor is the minute

43:07.367 --> 43:08.629
we're gonna let it go again.

43:14.461 --> 43:16.158
Deck crew, deck crew, Lexi.

43:18.639 --> 43:20.554
<i>Getting a little nervous.</i>

43:20.598 --> 43:24.036
Oh, my God, that's ----ing
crazy-looking out there.

43:24.079 --> 43:25.646
Oh, look at these waves.

43:25.690 --> 43:27.474
I'm scared, I want out
of this place.

43:27.517 --> 43:30.172
Woo-hoo!

43:30.216 --> 43:31.565
Lloyd, Lloyd, Lexi.

43:31.609 --> 43:33.654
<i>Lexi, we are anchoring.</i>

43:33.698 --> 43:35.134
Come on.

43:36.744 --> 43:38.703
Look what's coming right at me.

43:38.746 --> 43:40.574
Holy sh--!

43:44.709 --> 43:46.580
Holy F!

43:46.624 --> 43:48.626
Holy sh--!

43:53.543 --> 43:55.676
Ah!

43:55.720 --> 43:57.678
Red on deck, red on deck!

43:57.722 --> 44:00.289
This is gonna pass, I promise.
