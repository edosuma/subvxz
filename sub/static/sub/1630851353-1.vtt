00:06.760 --> 00:09.760
NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:27.440 --> 00:28.400
Let's go!

00:32.960 --> 00:35.480
I'M MARRYING THE PERFECT MAN

00:37.640 --> 00:38.520
Too cool!

00:39.040 --> 00:40.680
Okay, let's go.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.640
Let's get this bachelorette party started.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.160
Come on!

00:50.240 --> 00:51.440
Come on, Titi!

00:59.000 --> 01:00.800
Are you coming or not, Titi?

01:21.400 --> 01:22.840
There you go!

01:42.200 --> 01:43.400
Hey, Titi!

01:44.840 --> 01:45.880
Titi!

01:46.960 --> 01:48.240
Titi, film us!

01:51.720 --> 01:53.240
Let's go!

02:40.560 --> 02:41.600
Titi, come!

02:41.680 --> 02:43.240
Yeah, come on, Titi!

02:43.320 --> 02:44.160
No.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.240
Come on!

02:45.320 --> 02:46.840
No, I don't have my earplugs.

02:49.480 --> 02:50.840
Oh, come on!

03:03.680 --> 03:05.240
Are you from Paris too?

03:05.320 --> 03:06.640
Yeah.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.600
And you? Are you Brazilian?

03:08.680 --> 03:10.480
Even better, I'm Portuguese.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.560
Yeah, Portugal's nice.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.000
It's more exotic, isn't it?

03:14.600 --> 03:15.720
Yeah, that's true.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.440
What are you going to do now?

03:18.320 --> 03:19.160
Now?

03:20.400 --> 03:23.480
I'm going to read a little
and then go to bed.

03:26.320 --> 03:29.000
Can I come too?

03:30.840 --> 03:31.960
To read?

03:34.840 --> 03:35.680
Sorry.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.320
Sorry, not to read.

03:39.160 --> 03:41.280
Well, no. I'm not…

03:41.360 --> 03:42.840
I'm not like that at all.

03:42.920 --> 03:43.760
I'm not…

03:47.760 --> 03:49.120
So, you're into girls?

03:50.200 --> 03:51.800
-Well, yes.
-Is that it?

03:52.400 --> 03:53.560
You like girls?

03:53.640 --> 03:54.520
Yes.

03:55.720 --> 03:56.800
You're into girls.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.720
Sir! No, sir!

05:03.800 --> 05:05.520
No, those are my things!

06:00.120 --> 06:00.960
Are you okay?

06:04.480 --> 06:05.560
Are you okay?

06:05.640 --> 06:08.120
What was that? It stings.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.560
-You must've stepped on a weever.
-What?

06:10.640 --> 06:12.960
A weever fish, they hide in the sand.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.080
-It stings!
-The fish's venom can cause a stroke.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.280
What? Hurry! Help me!

06:20.800 --> 06:21.720
Okay.

06:24.240 --> 06:25.360
What the hell is this?

06:25.440 --> 06:27.240
I know. I'm sorry.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.080
I can't really explain…

06:29.160 --> 06:30.640
-Relax, I'm a nurse.
-Okay.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.360
-Take me to the hotel.
-Come on.

06:37.520 --> 06:38.640
Room number?

06:38.720 --> 06:40.320
But I don't even know you.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.760
I need medical care.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.840
-I know what to do.
-Let me go.

06:43.920 --> 06:44.920
All right.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.720
Yes, it's the venom.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.280
-Room 108.
-Got it.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.680
108.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.760
Don't worry. I know what to do.

06:57.840 --> 06:58.800
Okay.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.600
Hold on.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.760
The heat neutralizes the venom.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.440
You'll feel better soon.

07:15.520 --> 07:16.440
Okay.

07:18.080 --> 07:20.560
Your foot is easy to style.

07:36.960 --> 07:38.400
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

07:39.280 --> 07:40.400
-Here.
-Great.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.640
Up, there you go.

07:41.720 --> 07:42.640
Thanks.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.080
By the way, I'm Rose.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.480
Thibault Galland.

07:46.080 --> 07:48.080
How about a drink, Mr. Galland?

07:48.920 --> 07:50.480
Yeah, sure.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.680
But you'll need to…

07:52.760 --> 07:54.040
Yes, of course.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.800
There's the "Ugly Baby" collection.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.200
LITTLE BASTARD

08:02.280 --> 08:03.600
The "Street" collection.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.080
GIRL POWER

08:05.720 --> 08:06.960
It's awesome.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.960
It's great. I love it.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.600
-Yeah?
-This is great.

08:10.680 --> 08:11.880
What's this one?

08:12.840 --> 08:14.640
That's our "floor mop" romper.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.840
Babies are always crawling around.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.760
Why not make the most of it?

08:18.840 --> 08:20.720
It's brilliant.

08:20.800 --> 08:21.720
Great idea.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.440
I'd like to order some.
I work in pediatrics.

08:24.520 --> 08:25.440
Okay.

08:26.280 --> 08:27.840
Are you here on vacation?

08:27.920 --> 08:29.960
No, for a bachelorette party.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.040
What brings you here?

08:33.880 --> 08:36.360
I'm here for some stupid trade show.

08:38.160 --> 08:40.040
Actually, I needed to get away.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.920
I broke up with my boyfriend.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.840
That's great! I mean…

08:43.920 --> 08:45.840
No, not great that you broke up,

08:45.920 --> 08:49.000
but sometimes it's nice to be single.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.920
I'm single, and it's awesome.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.040
Just great.

08:53.120 --> 08:56.600
For example,
my friend's getting married next week…

08:56.680 --> 08:58.440
I have to say, her fiancé's mean…

08:58.520 --> 09:01.120
But, you know, I think 25 is young.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.360
Feeling good in your own skin,

09:03.440 --> 09:05.480
that's the most important thing.

09:05.560 --> 09:09.920
I feel good in your skin.
I mean, in my skin. So, it's cool, right?

09:10.920 --> 09:12.160
Yes, you're right.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.040
Really important.

09:15.840 --> 09:19.000
Does it hurt?
We need to get the blood flowing.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.200
-Okay.
-There.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.960
That feels really good.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.400
All right! There you go.

09:37.480 --> 09:38.720
Is that better?

09:40.320 --> 09:41.160
Great.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.560
-Okay.
-Well.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.880
It's getting late.

09:53.040 --> 09:55.120
I have to be up early.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.160
Like…

10:04.320 --> 10:06.440
Her name is Rose. She's 25.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.160
She's from Grenoble. She has two brothers.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.360
She started a kid's clothes company.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.320
What did you do?

10:13.200 --> 10:14.200
Well…

10:15.040 --> 10:17.640
-Nothing, it was great.
-Did you hook up?

10:17.720 --> 10:18.560
No.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.120
It wasn't the right time.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.240
I don't get it.

10:21.320 --> 10:24.000
You go to her room
for a drink and a massage.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.000
Are you stupid?

10:25.080 --> 10:26.160
It was an open bar.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.480
She was in a bad relationship.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.400
She said she needed time alone.

10:30.480 --> 10:31.840
She said that?

10:31.920 --> 10:33.520
-Yeah.
-Really?

10:33.600 --> 10:34.880
That's my impression.

10:35.920 --> 10:39.080
Did you tell her you used to jerk off
watching Little Mermaid?

10:40.920 --> 10:42.600
Come on. I was in 7th grade.

10:46.920 --> 10:48.720
I'd be pissed if I was her.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.680
She thinks you're not interested.

10:50.760 --> 10:52.960
That's ridiculous. What do you know?

10:55.120 --> 10:57.840
Titi, when was the last time you had sex?

10:57.920 --> 10:58.920
-Two years.
-What?

10:59.000 --> 11:00.760
-Stop.
-Just ask me.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.080
He's forgotten how.

11:02.160 --> 11:05.000
We all know
what you're like when you're in love.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.160
You had a crush on us all.

11:08.040 --> 11:08.920
What?

11:10.120 --> 11:11.080
Come on…

11:13.200 --> 11:16.080
I had a crush on all of you? Yeah, right!

11:16.160 --> 11:18.960
You should be so lucky.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.480
And…

11:22.840 --> 11:24.400
You women, seriously.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.760
That's nonsense.

11:25.840 --> 11:26.720
Unbelievable.

11:59.640 --> 12:02.720
RECEPTION
BIRTHING UNIT

12:02.800 --> 12:05.040
OLDER CHILDREN SECTION

12:11.680 --> 12:12.520
So,

12:13.760 --> 12:16.440
I have two pills for you.
What do I get in exchange?

12:16.520 --> 12:18.240
Nothing, I don't even want pills.

12:19.480 --> 12:20.960
Tagada, the crazy horse?

12:21.040 --> 12:23.000
No, he's mine.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.960
These aren't free.
They're extremely valuable.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.520
-Really?
-Yeah. Everybody around here wants these.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.600
Okay, let's make a deal.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.880
Pills for the last banana candy.
That's my best offer.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.040
Okay.

13:01.840 --> 13:02.800
Ready?

13:03.840 --> 13:04.680
Yeah.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.800
Can you help me with the rent this month?

13:09.880 --> 13:11.080
Again?

13:11.160 --> 13:12.920
But you had bonus pay.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.680
I'm saving up for med school.

13:15.280 --> 13:16.640
Did you register?

13:16.720 --> 13:18.720
I'm going next week.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.560
Will you give me the money?

13:22.360 --> 13:24.480
Yeah, okay.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.400
-Rock, paper, scissors?
-Go on.

13:30.160 --> 13:31.520
Rock, paper, scissors.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.560
Rock, paper, scissors. Shit.

13:34.640 --> 13:35.960
Hi, Alicia.

13:36.840 --> 13:39.240
Lulu's giving you your shot today.

13:42.680 --> 13:44.880
-He hasn't come to visit?
-No.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.400
I don't want him to see me like this.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.480
Take it easy! That hurts!

13:53.320 --> 13:54.600
Idiot!

13:54.680 --> 13:55.720
Take it off!

14:01.240 --> 14:02.440
Can you turn for me?

14:04.400 --> 14:06.480
You know the drill. It's going to sting.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.480
Breathe out. And…

14:11.240 --> 14:13.600
Shit, seriously? You'll pay for this.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.200
Easy now.

14:19.760 --> 14:21.080
I knew it.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.320
-Guess who wants to see me?
-What?

14:23.400 --> 14:25.440
It's Rose. A date at 5:00 p.m.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.240
-At five?
-Yeah.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.720
It's too early. Say no.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.560
Suggest dinner at nine
in a hip restaurant.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.520
No, she probably can't make it later.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.480
But…

14:36.560 --> 14:38.080
Stupid! Listen to her!

14:38.160 --> 14:41.160
Do you think she wants to hook up at five?

14:41.240 --> 14:43.800
Take these to her while you're at it.

15:35.320 --> 15:36.280
-Hello.
-Hi.

15:36.360 --> 15:37.400
Sorry, I'm late.

15:37.480 --> 15:38.880
-No worries.
-How are you?

15:40.360 --> 15:41.560
This is for you.

15:41.640 --> 15:42.720
-For me?
-Yes.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.120
It's very sweet of you.

15:49.960 --> 15:52.040
It's on children's fashion
in the Middle Ages.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.480
I know this painting.

15:54.560 --> 15:57.520
It's on exhibit at the Louvre,
by Jean Hey.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.960
And that's Charles-Orland. He died young.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.360
-Great.
-Yeah.

16:02.440 --> 16:05.080
That'll be our first son's name, for luck.

16:05.160 --> 16:08.160
Not so fast.
I don't make babies with just anyone.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.920
No, I'd love to have babies with you.

16:13.920 --> 16:16.680
-What do you want to do?
-Whatever you like.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.280
-Yeah?
-Whatever you want.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.160
You might regret saying that.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.360
I noticed a clothes sale nearby.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.960
I'd love to go.

16:24.040 --> 16:25.360
All right, let's go.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.720
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, fine.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.480
-It's this way.
-Okay.

16:30.480 --> 16:31.560
See?

16:31.640 --> 16:34.280
-Bruno never wanted to come with me.
-Bruno?

16:34.360 --> 16:35.640
Yeah, my ex.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.560
Oh yeah. Right…

16:37.640 --> 16:41.080
Jerk! He's already posting
pictures of himself with some bimbo.

16:42.760 --> 16:43.840
Can you imagine?

16:44.480 --> 16:45.760
Yeah, not cool.

16:45.840 --> 16:46.920
No respect.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.240
Let's not get into that.

16:50.320 --> 16:51.680
No, I don't mind.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.760
Honestly,

16:54.840 --> 16:57.120
I don't usually go for guys like that.

16:57.200 --> 17:00.640
Lower-class guys
who think they can make it to the top.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.080
He fought so hard to seduce me,

17:03.160 --> 17:04.880
I ended up falling for him.

17:05.520 --> 17:06.800
And then he changed?

17:06.880 --> 17:07.800
Big time.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.920
As soon as I fell in love with him,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.200
he started lying, standing me up…

17:14.240 --> 17:17.560
Then I'd find out
he'd been partying with his rappers.

17:17.640 --> 17:20.200
-He's a rapper?
-No, he owns a label.

17:22.600 --> 17:23.520
Really.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.720
-I'll see you later.
-Yeah.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.000
CAN WE MEET UP?

18:29.040 --> 18:30.320
Thanks.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.600
Thanks very much.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.160
Cheers.

19:18.360 --> 19:21.960
Rose, I know
your last relationship wasn't the best,

19:22.040 --> 19:25.280
but I think we'd make a great couple.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.000
That was good.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.200
-Hey!
-Hi.

19:39.280 --> 19:40.760
How are you?

19:40.840 --> 19:44.320
I got my period. I just want
to eat pizza and watch Netflix.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.480
Come in.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.160
Would you like some tea?

19:48.240 --> 19:49.680
No, too much caffeine.

19:49.760 --> 19:50.720
Trying to quit?

19:50.800 --> 19:51.800
Yeah.

19:55.840 --> 19:58.240
I hadn't noticed how handsome you are!

19:58.840 --> 19:59.680
Thanks.

19:59.760 --> 20:00.680
A date?

20:00.760 --> 20:02.400
Well, yes.

20:03.560 --> 20:05.200
-With who?
-With you.

20:07.120 --> 20:08.440
I hope you have condoms.

20:09.560 --> 20:12.040
Well, yeah.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.560
Then, bro, let's do it.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.920
It's so weird.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.520
Wouldn't that be crazy?

20:27.360 --> 20:28.560
Crazy.

20:30.920 --> 20:32.320
Oh my God.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.040
Well, sit down.

20:35.120 --> 20:36.120
What?

20:36.960 --> 20:39.840
Sit? Yes, of course.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.120
But…

20:42.720 --> 20:44.440
No, I have to go.

20:44.520 --> 20:46.560
I forgot. I'm meeting my ex for dinner.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.840
She works night shifts at the morgue.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.280
-Wow, crazy.
-Yeah.

20:51.360 --> 20:52.520
It's pretty crazy.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.120
I can't wait to meet her.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.480
Yeah, sure.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.040
-That's my room.
-Right.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.720
And so…

20:58.800 --> 21:01.800
Good night. Enjoy your period.

21:43.560 --> 21:44.600
-Hi.
-How are you?

21:45.400 --> 21:46.480
Good.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.640
He's like a lost soul.

21:58.440 --> 21:59.440
Are you okay?

22:01.600 --> 22:02.960
I should've listened.

22:06.920 --> 22:07.880
It's over now.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.120
Maybe there's something we can do.

22:11.160 --> 22:14.360
No, it's hopeless.
I'm a loser, that's all.

22:14.440 --> 22:17.000
You have everything
a girl could ever want.

22:17.080 --> 22:18.880
Do you know why you never have sex?

22:20.240 --> 22:23.040
Because you always end up
in the friendzone.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.440
Let's be clear, she called him, "bro."

22:26.520 --> 22:28.560
-No, but…
-Seriously, it's…

22:30.520 --> 22:31.920
He's in the friendzone.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.040
Okay.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.000
What's the deal with…

22:38.280 --> 22:39.240
Go on.

22:39.320 --> 22:42.440
When you're just friends,
there's no mystery,

22:42.520 --> 22:44.920
no sexual tension, or seduction.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.840
As a friend, you'll never be a boyfriend.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.960
It's systematic with you.

22:50.040 --> 22:53.120
-How can I get out of it?
-It's almost impossible.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.720
The magic happens in the beginning.

22:55.800 --> 22:56.880
It'll be difficult.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.000
So, I'll end up alone with a cat.

22:59.080 --> 23:01.280
No, you've got us now.

23:01.360 --> 23:02.640
We have a plan.

23:02.720 --> 23:03.760
First things first.

23:03.840 --> 23:07.760
What would you say are
your greatest strengths with women?

23:09.000 --> 23:09.840
So?

23:09.920 --> 23:11.080
I'm honest.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.200
Yes, that's true.

23:13.280 --> 23:17.200
You never cheated in school.
That's a real turn-on, isn't it?

23:19.280 --> 23:23.320
All right, well…
I don't know. I'm attentive.

23:23.400 --> 23:26.240
-No, you're not attentive.
-But I am.

23:26.320 --> 23:27.200
You're

23:28.000 --> 23:28.840
accommodating.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.640
-Yes.
-What does that mean?

23:30.720 --> 23:33.760
You always say yes
to make things easy, to be nice.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.480
But we never know what you really want.

23:38.160 --> 23:40.000
You want me to stop being nice?

23:40.080 --> 23:41.080
No.

23:41.160 --> 23:44.640
-No, it's just that--
-You have to stand up for yourself.

23:44.720 --> 23:47.440
Nice people can be annoying.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.280
There are other sides to me.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.600
I'm funny. I'm always joking around.

23:52.680 --> 23:53.520
That's true.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.720
Quality matters more than quantity.

23:55.800 --> 23:58.200
Come on, he's funny sometimes, isn't he?

23:58.280 --> 24:00.640
-You'll laugh at anything.
-No, not true.

24:00.720 --> 24:01.960
-Yes.
-No, not true.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.160
-Yes.
-No.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.720
-Stop.
-Okay.

24:04.800 --> 24:08.200
So basically,
I shouldn't be nice or tell jokes.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.160
I can't do anything.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.440
But in your case, it's a turnoff.

24:12.520 --> 24:13.920
Exactly.

24:16.600 --> 24:19.160
Tell me then, what should I do about Rose?

24:19.240 --> 24:20.120
So…

24:22.320 --> 24:23.360
You disappear.

24:23.440 --> 24:26.360
Tell her you're going far away
on some mission.

24:26.440 --> 24:28.600
-Yeah, far like Siberia.
-Right.

24:28.680 --> 24:31.040
No phones, no Internet, or messages.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.320
She won't be able to reach you.

24:33.400 --> 24:36.520
She forgets you're friends,
and we give you a makeover.

24:36.600 --> 24:41.040
When we think you're ready,
you come back as a sexy hunk.

24:41.880 --> 24:42.880
Get it?

24:43.680 --> 24:44.520
Okay.

24:45.560 --> 24:46.440
When?

24:47.640 --> 24:49.160
Workout, Vincennes park.

24:49.240 --> 24:50.800
But that's in the morning.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.520
Don't ever be late again.

25:08.360 --> 25:09.280
Let's go.

25:11.880 --> 25:13.680
FITNESS TRAIL
HARD - EASY

25:13.760 --> 25:15.520
You're a great guy, Titi.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.160
You just don't know it.

25:17.240 --> 25:19.280
And girls can't see it either.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.080
You need an image.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.680
If we all had a color,

25:22.760 --> 25:24.320
I'd be red.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.080
Why? Because I'm determined.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.560
I make things happen.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.600
What color would you be?

25:30.720 --> 25:31.680
I don't know.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.480
Beige.

25:33.560 --> 25:36.080
Yeah, beige goes with everything.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.160
But it's boring.

25:37.920 --> 25:40.800
-You know anyone who wants a beige car?
-No.

25:40.880 --> 25:43.640
It's the same with you.
No one's interested.

25:47.640 --> 25:48.640
Come on.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.520
Come on. Give it all you've got.

26:03.280 --> 26:04.560
Shit.

26:04.640 --> 26:07.480
You need to be able
to share your feelings,

26:07.560 --> 26:08.680
speak your mind.

26:08.760 --> 26:09.720
But I do.

26:09.800 --> 26:13.240
Okay. Tell me one thing
that made you angry this week.

26:16.960 --> 26:17.920
My banker.

26:18.000 --> 26:18.880
-Banker?
-Yes.

26:18.960 --> 26:21.400
Are all bankers motherfuckers to you?

26:22.280 --> 26:23.960
Did you forget, I work in a bank?

26:24.040 --> 26:26.480
No, that's not what I meant at all.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.160
-And you in HR--
-Beige!

26:28.240 --> 26:29.560
That's a beige answer.

26:30.320 --> 26:31.800
Say they're motherfuckers.

26:32.400 --> 26:34.680
You're always trying to avoid conflict.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.840
You can't have real intimacy
unless you're sincere.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.800
You're not some doormat.

26:43.400 --> 26:44.320
Sit straight.

26:46.680 --> 26:47.520
There.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.920
Open your chest.

26:50.280 --> 26:51.360
Shine.

26:52.680 --> 26:53.640
Lulu's right.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.040
You need Kizomba.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.240
-What?
-An African dance.

26:57.320 --> 27:00.200
All right, I have real work to do.
See you.

27:00.840 --> 27:01.880
No, Maud…

27:02.640 --> 27:03.760
I don't dance.

27:04.880 --> 27:05.760
Shit…

27:28.320 --> 27:32.440
Girls these days,
we make our own money, we drive, we vote.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.800
We have no time to waste.
We want sensual men

27:34.880 --> 27:38.000
like Pharrell Williams
or Justin Timberlake, you know?

27:42.400 --> 27:43.800
Hi.

27:43.880 --> 27:44.920
Hi, Félicien.

27:47.480 --> 27:50.120
Relax. One, two, three, boom boom cha.

27:53.040 --> 27:54.080
Stand straight.

27:54.680 --> 27:56.080
First, a slow ocho.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.880
Turn, one, two, three.

27:57.960 --> 27:58.960
Boom, boom, cha.

27:59.040 --> 28:00.920
-Boom boom cha?
-Here we go.

28:03.680 --> 28:04.920
-Straighten up.
-Okay.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.600
Put your hand on my back.

28:11.160 --> 28:12.000
Sorry.

28:13.720 --> 28:14.960
That must've hurt.

28:15.040 --> 28:15.920
A little.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.960
Did you know? You talk way too much.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.120
Yeah.

28:33.200 --> 28:34.040
Too much.

28:34.120 --> 28:36.400
A woman should be curious.

28:36.480 --> 28:38.480
Don't spit everything out.

28:38.560 --> 28:41.040
Men talk a lot, but they don't say much.

28:41.120 --> 28:44.040
You have to learn
the art of silent pauses.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.240
You'll gain an advantage.

28:45.320 --> 28:46.440
And no laughing.

28:46.520 --> 28:49.240
And stop always saying, "Great!"

28:49.320 --> 28:50.840
-So annoying.
-It's…

28:50.920 --> 28:52.040
Look at me.

28:52.120 --> 28:56.560
We want a man comfortable with silence
who's not trying to be funny.

28:56.640 --> 28:59.120
That's a confident, charismatic man.

29:00.560 --> 29:01.760
You don't get it.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.040
No, he doesn't…

29:03.120 --> 29:06.320
How can I get close to someone
if I don't talk?

29:06.400 --> 29:07.800
Just be present.

29:07.880 --> 29:08.840
Listen.

29:08.920 --> 29:11.880
That's your ticket to intimacy.

29:12.560 --> 29:14.880
Then you need a degree of ambiguity.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.080
Ambiguity?

29:17.040 --> 29:18.320
A little naughtiness.

29:19.520 --> 29:20.680
Naughtiness?

29:22.360 --> 29:23.680
Let's try something.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.840
I really enjoy being with you, I…

29:38.880 --> 29:42.360
You seem sensitive. You really listen.

29:42.440 --> 29:43.520
Yeah?

29:44.880 --> 29:46.600
You have a very nice name.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.440
You know what it reminds me of?

29:48.520 --> 29:49.360
No.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.480
A knight

29:53.120 --> 29:55.360
with his dragon.

29:56.320 --> 29:57.600
His armor.

29:59.640 --> 30:02.560
His long, hard sword.

30:05.800 --> 30:06.960
You can talk now.

30:07.640 --> 30:11.160
Well, it's a derivative of Théeubalt
from the Middle Ages.

30:11.240 --> 30:12.320
Seriously?

30:13.440 --> 30:15.120
I can't discuss etymology?

30:15.200 --> 30:16.960
-No!
-We don't care.

30:17.040 --> 30:20.280
This is the reason why
women suffer from vaginal dryness.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.520
Shot, please.

30:22.560 --> 30:23.600
Yes, please.

30:26.600 --> 30:27.880
Is she your type?

30:31.320 --> 30:32.240
Yes.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.360
I like that.

30:37.280 --> 30:39.160
Jennifer Paoli, influencer.

30:39.240 --> 30:42.000
She became a millionaire
by posting breakfast pics.

30:42.080 --> 30:42.920
No.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.240
They even published her profile on TV.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.680
She's attractive.

30:47.760 --> 30:48.840
Single?

30:48.920 --> 30:50.000
Straight, Maud.

30:56.360 --> 30:58.000
Back to business, Titi.

30:59.280 --> 31:00.800
We told you, sit up.

31:00.880 --> 31:01.920
That's it.

31:05.440 --> 31:06.560
Too sweet.

31:11.800 --> 31:12.960
-Alex?
-Yes?

31:13.040 --> 31:15.360
What makes sex good for girls?

31:17.040 --> 31:18.040
So?

31:18.120 --> 31:19.160
How's it going?

31:19.240 --> 31:20.600
He's no good in bed.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.480
What? No, not at all.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.080
That's not what I said.

31:24.160 --> 31:25.040
Thibault.

31:26.560 --> 31:29.080
Sex is with a partner, do you understand?

31:29.160 --> 31:31.200
Every relationship is different.

31:31.280 --> 31:33.960
Nothing is really good or bad.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.640
-But we can teach you some basics.
-Really?

31:38.720 --> 31:41.320
Like what? Role-playing? Or…

31:41.400 --> 31:43.440
The three of us? Like a threesome?

31:43.520 --> 31:45.440
No, calm down.

31:45.520 --> 31:46.760
Okay.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.280
The thumb, for example.

31:51.440 --> 31:52.280
The thumb?

31:52.960 --> 31:53.800
What about it?

31:53.880 --> 31:55.160
You don't use it?

31:55.240 --> 31:56.880
Why? Should I?

31:57.800 --> 31:59.840
Alex's husband used his thumb,

31:59.920 --> 32:02.120
and she married him right away.

32:02.200 --> 32:03.080
-Really?
-Yes.

32:04.280 --> 32:05.360
No, it's not true.

32:07.200 --> 32:10.840
But I'm interested.
Why did you choose him?

32:12.280 --> 32:13.440
I don't know.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.960
He's charming, vulnerable.

32:16.040 --> 32:18.200
He said he loved me.
I knew he was the one.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.560
I could see it in his eyes.

32:21.760 --> 32:22.760
He needed me.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.640
You can't top that.

32:27.920 --> 32:31.360
Don't ever say you love someone
unless you're sincere.

32:32.240 --> 32:34.400
How do you do that?

32:34.480 --> 32:35.600
What do you say?

32:35.680 --> 32:38.200
I can't explain it. You have to feel it.

32:57.560 --> 33:00.000
Three. Step back. Have her face you.

33:04.120 --> 33:05.840
I bought myself a bonsai.

33:08.600 --> 33:09.880
Thibault, come on!

33:20.120 --> 33:21.880
Come on, eight!

33:21.960 --> 33:23.920
Again, come on.

33:24.000 --> 33:24.880
And three.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.880
This is a thumb, okay?

33:36.800 --> 33:38.320
So, there's the tap.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.200
You see? Softly.

33:40.280 --> 33:42.600
And you caress in small circles.

33:42.680 --> 33:43.880
Like that.

33:43.960 --> 33:45.040
And tap.

33:45.680 --> 33:47.520
That's it.

33:47.600 --> 33:50.160
And up.

33:50.240 --> 33:51.880
Gently.

33:51.960 --> 33:53.040
The other thumb.

33:53.920 --> 33:54.840
Gently.

33:54.920 --> 33:56.640
You can hook it too.

33:56.720 --> 33:59.000
It's all in the wrist.

33:59.080 --> 34:02.920
Anchor and hook.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.520
Use your finger too.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.600
One, two, exactly.

34:06.680 --> 34:07.600
Perfect!

34:51.120 --> 34:52.760
I went to visit cancer patients.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.200
They were calm, taking their time.

35:10.560 --> 35:11.440
Wow!

35:13.080 --> 35:17.440
The opening of Rose's new showroom,
Titi, it's the perfect setting.

35:17.520 --> 35:19.000
Remember your story?

35:19.080 --> 35:21.120
Siberia, great land of contrasts.

35:21.200 --> 35:23.240
I was in a village in Yakutia.

35:23.320 --> 35:26.160
It was the most intense
experience of my life.

35:26.240 --> 35:28.240
Forces of nature, people, etc…

35:28.320 --> 35:30.840
And don't pay too much attention to her.

35:30.920 --> 35:31.760
Okay.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.200
Congratulate her.

35:33.280 --> 35:34.760
We'll stay 15 minutes.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.880
You have a Kizomba party to go to.

35:37.480 --> 35:39.600
Then I offer to take her next time.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.400
You've got this!

35:41.480 --> 35:43.440
-Okay.
-Here we go.

35:49.560 --> 35:51.560
Your collection is beautiful.

35:51.640 --> 35:52.560
-Like it?
-Yes.

35:53.480 --> 35:54.800
Titi, you're back!

35:55.480 --> 35:57.400
I'd never miss this.

35:57.480 --> 35:58.720
Your first showroom.

36:00.080 --> 36:02.040
This is Alexandra, Maud, and Lulu.

36:02.120 --> 36:03.160
Nice to meet you.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.080
-Hi.
-Is there a cloakroom?

36:05.160 --> 36:06.760
Yes, next to the bathroom.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.040
-Okay.
-Thanks.

36:08.120 --> 36:09.400
You look great.

36:09.480 --> 36:11.240
Thanks, so do you.

36:11.320 --> 36:12.320
You're sweet.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.920
Well done. It's amazing.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.840
Thanks. I'm expecting
a Zampa executive. I'm a bit stressed.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.880
He'll love it, don't worry.

36:19.960 --> 36:21.280
Where were you?

36:21.360 --> 36:22.920
I was in Siberia.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.880
I was training local nomadic caregivers.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.400
Yeah, that's great.

36:27.480 --> 36:28.320
Amazing.

36:28.400 --> 36:29.800
Wait, my boyfriend!

36:30.640 --> 36:32.080
Bruno, come here.

36:33.160 --> 36:37.280
He called to apologize about a month ago
and invited me to move in.

36:39.720 --> 36:41.480
This is Thibault.

36:41.560 --> 36:42.800
Right, Pipi!

36:42.880 --> 36:44.600
The nude guy on the beach.

36:44.680 --> 36:47.400
Thanks for taking care of her.
She's lost without me.

36:48.160 --> 36:50.880
There's no more champagne, darling.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.480
Shall I call and order 30 bottles?

36:53.560 --> 36:54.720
No, there's more.

36:54.800 --> 36:55.680
-Get it.
-Yes.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.440
You don't want to be stingy.

36:57.520 --> 36:58.840
Yeah, you're right.

36:58.920 --> 37:01.360
Stay here, Titi.
I have so much to tell you.

37:05.960 --> 37:08.320
So, you're a hospital porter?

37:08.400 --> 37:09.760
-Nurse.
-Yes.

37:09.840 --> 37:12.680
You're in social services.
Honestly, that's--

37:12.760 --> 37:14.480
I really respect that.

37:15.240 --> 37:17.440
Not for me. I wanted to make money.

37:17.960 --> 37:20.520
If ever you need any, just call me. Here.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.520
Seriously, just call me.

37:25.920 --> 37:26.800
No.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.840
No, I can't believe it.

37:32.160 --> 37:33.040
Maud.

37:34.200 --> 37:36.920
-Bruno.
-How long has it been? Five years?

37:37.000 --> 37:38.840
Okay? You're white as a ghost.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.640
-What are you doing here?
-I'm with a friend.

37:42.720 --> 37:43.880
Fifi?

37:43.960 --> 37:45.080
You know that guy?

37:45.880 --> 37:47.680
You're a real bombshell.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.880
You're making me hot…

37:52.840 --> 37:54.920
-You still into girls?
-Still, yes.

37:55.560 --> 37:56.480
Keep in touch.

37:56.560 --> 37:58.760
-If ever you want…
-No.

38:00.040 --> 38:01.000
See you later.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.160
I hate that guy.

38:05.240 --> 38:06.560
Who?

38:06.640 --> 38:07.800
Him.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.680
Here's to the designer
of the Kooky Kids collection.

38:12.760 --> 38:14.960
A toast to you, my darling.

38:15.960 --> 38:19.920
Believe me,
starting a new business isn't easy.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.360
When I started,
no one ever gave me a chance.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.400
I'm a self-made man.

38:26.200 --> 38:28.440
I hope you'll have the same success.

38:28.520 --> 38:29.360
To Rose!

38:29.440 --> 38:31.040
-To Rose!
-Thank you.

38:35.800 --> 38:36.760
Congratulations.

38:38.800 --> 38:39.720
Thanks.

38:41.960 --> 38:43.360
I have to get out of here.

39:51.120 --> 39:52.880
ME AND MY DETOX WATER

40:07.640 --> 40:08.680
One more?

40:09.880 --> 40:11.240
It's nice to see you.

40:11.320 --> 40:12.920
And so soon.

40:13.520 --> 40:14.440
That's how I am.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.280
I'm straightforward.

40:16.360 --> 40:17.880
You don't usually drink?

40:18.800 --> 40:21.120
If this is some game, it won't work.

40:21.200 --> 40:22.680
I'm usually a saint.

40:23.440 --> 40:25.800
I don't drink or smoke.
I'm in social services.

40:27.480 --> 40:29.120
No sex on the first date.

40:30.040 --> 40:31.080
Really?

40:31.160 --> 40:34.080
I'm the same. No drugs or alcohol.

40:34.160 --> 40:36.640
My job is kind of a social service too.

40:37.280 --> 40:39.080
And casual sex is not my thing.

40:42.160 --> 40:45.240
What if we broke all our rules tonight?

40:45.320 --> 40:46.840
Did you hear what I said?

40:46.920 --> 40:49.000
I can't stop thinking about you.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.920
But I want a serious man

40:51.000 --> 40:53.360
who can accept my status and lifestyle.

40:53.440 --> 40:55.320
That's what I want too.

40:57.200 --> 40:58.320
Yeah?

40:59.320 --> 41:00.600
You want proof?

41:03.280 --> 41:05.320
I haven't had sex in over a year.

41:07.120 --> 41:08.040
Really?

41:10.120 --> 41:10.960
Why?

41:12.280 --> 41:13.520
That's just how I am.

41:14.480 --> 41:15.760
It has to be meaningful.

41:17.800 --> 41:19.400
And I really like you…

41:22.000 --> 41:23.040
You know what?

41:24.520 --> 41:26.480
I haven't had sex in a year either.

41:54.480 --> 41:55.520
Okay.

42:11.680 --> 42:14.120
Yes!

42:22.440 --> 42:24.560
What are you doing with your thumb?

42:41.080 --> 42:43.200
As I'm heading into the storeroom,

42:44.240 --> 42:46.240
who do I see walking out in heels?

42:47.160 --> 42:48.080
Go on, tell us!

42:49.680 --> 42:50.880
Jennifer.

42:50.960 --> 42:51.880
No.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.120
No way.

42:54.640 --> 42:58.560
Our Titi had sex with her at the hospital?

42:58.640 --> 43:02.040
He wanted to be naughty
and break all the rules.

43:02.120 --> 43:03.560
He was long overdue.

43:03.640 --> 43:04.840
Well…

43:04.920 --> 43:07.560
Rose has no idea what she's missing.

43:07.640 --> 43:11.000
Her stupid asshole of a boyfriend
won't stop texting me.

43:11.080 --> 43:11.960
-No.
-Yes.

43:12.040 --> 43:13.960
He wants me to shift to penises.

43:14.040 --> 43:15.240
Bruno?

43:15.320 --> 43:17.400
He says his is spectacular.

43:18.800 --> 43:21.720
Watch it.
Here he comes, and he's with her.

43:25.080 --> 43:27.320
Hi, girls. This is Jennifer.

43:27.880 --> 43:28.720
Hi, girls.

43:28.800 --> 43:30.000
-Hello.
-Hi.

43:30.080 --> 43:31.040
Hi there.

43:32.560 --> 43:33.880
Can we see the menu?

43:33.960 --> 43:36.280
And water with lemon for my girlfriend.

43:36.360 --> 43:39.240
Warm water and unwaxed lemon, please.

43:39.320 --> 43:40.720
-All right.
-Okay.

43:52.040 --> 43:53.760
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

43:53.840 --> 43:55.480
-Well…
-So…

43:55.560 --> 43:57.120
There's nothing raw here.

43:57.200 --> 43:59.120
Tomatoes are so inflammatory.

44:01.360 --> 44:02.800
I'm sorry,

44:02.880 --> 44:04.600
I really watch what I eat.

44:04.680 --> 44:06.080
It's really important.

44:06.600 --> 44:08.200
We saw that on Instagram.

44:08.280 --> 44:09.520
No, it's admirable.

44:09.600 --> 44:12.360
You know, people die of gluten every day.

44:12.440 --> 44:14.800
-No, it's horrible.
-Yeah.

44:14.880 --> 44:17.200
I need to sanitize. I'll be right back.

44:21.560 --> 44:22.920
She's cool, isn't she?

44:23.600 --> 44:26.400
She seems a little intense.

44:26.480 --> 44:27.360
-Yes.
-Yeah.

44:27.440 --> 44:30.440
If only you knew what we did.
I think she likes me.

44:30.520 --> 44:31.880
Isn't this too fast?

44:31.960 --> 44:35.160
Aren't you proud?
I'd never have done this before.

44:35.240 --> 44:36.200
Thanks to you.

44:39.880 --> 44:41.720
-Can I have a word?
-Yes.

44:48.320 --> 44:49.320
Okay.

44:50.760 --> 44:53.360
I'm sorry, Jen has just finished fasting,

44:53.440 --> 44:55.080
and the menu's not optimal.

44:56.040 --> 44:59.000
She's not used to
these types of restaurants.

44:59.080 --> 45:00.560
-She's higher-end.
-Sorry.

45:00.640 --> 45:02.400
It was fun, but another time?

45:02.480 --> 45:05.000
I'll choose next time,
and we'll eat for free.

45:06.240 --> 45:07.360
-Great.
-No problem.

45:07.440 --> 45:08.480
Photo?

45:08.560 --> 45:10.120
-Yes, absolutely.
-Sure.

45:21.600 --> 45:22.920
Ah, no, ugly.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.800
That's bad. Oh well.

45:24.880 --> 45:25.960
See you later.

45:26.560 --> 45:28.160
-Tchüss.
-Bye.

45:28.240 --> 45:29.640
-Ciao.
-Bye.

45:30.840 --> 45:32.080
Get out of my way.

45:32.640 --> 45:34.080
Where should we put it?

45:34.160 --> 45:35.440
Try over there.

45:35.520 --> 45:36.440
Good.

45:36.520 --> 45:37.360
Go on.

45:41.920 --> 45:43.280
Turn. Now turn again.

45:43.360 --> 45:44.640
Move it back.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
Set the flash.

45:47.080 --> 45:48.040
Like this?

45:53.160 --> 45:54.120
Perfect!

45:55.440 --> 45:56.560
I love you!

46:05.360 --> 46:07.040
This is Thibault's mailbox.

46:08.320 --> 46:09.800
What are you doing?

46:14.040 --> 46:15.480
No, what are you doing?

46:15.560 --> 46:16.800
Sorry, I don't--

46:26.360 --> 46:29.560
That's a close-up.
I want more of a body shot.

46:44.600 --> 46:46.000
Yes!

47:27.000 --> 47:28.720
I'm happy with you.

47:41.480 --> 47:45.160
Sorry, sweetheart.
You're so sweet! I love you!

47:46.720 --> 47:48.160
Who is this?

47:53.760 --> 47:54.800
Hey, there.

47:59.160 --> 48:00.200
Hey.

48:03.160 --> 48:04.120
My little baby.

48:24.080 --> 48:25.440
Yoo-hoo!

48:29.960 --> 48:32.320
So, I'll see you this afternoon.

48:32.400 --> 48:36.520
First, acupuncture,
and then Vegan Night at the Crillon Hotel.

48:38.160 --> 48:40.400
Honestly, I'm pretty tired.

48:40.480 --> 48:41.400
I'm going to--

48:41.920 --> 48:43.720
I won't be able to make it tonight.

48:44.440 --> 48:46.040
You want me to go alone?

48:47.920 --> 48:50.240
Why? It's not a big deal, is it?

48:50.320 --> 48:51.480
Not a big deal?

48:52.720 --> 48:55.560
What will my followers think
if I show up alone?

48:55.640 --> 48:57.400
Two million followers!

48:58.000 --> 48:59.960
I'm doing this for us.

49:00.040 --> 49:02.520
-I've never done this for anybody else.
-Okay.

49:03.640 --> 49:04.720
Well…

49:07.120 --> 49:08.880
I knew this would happen.

49:09.480 --> 49:10.800
You give everything…

49:12.320 --> 49:13.600
No…

49:13.680 --> 49:16.080
Wait, don't cry.

49:16.160 --> 49:17.880
You promised you'd be there.

49:17.960 --> 49:19.760
I'm under so much pressure.

49:19.840 --> 49:21.280
Of course. I see that.

49:21.360 --> 49:24.200
My job is just as important as your job.

49:24.280 --> 49:26.600
Yeah, just like caring for children.

49:27.800 --> 49:29.960
I'll go with you. It's fine.

49:30.040 --> 49:31.400
I'll come, okay?

49:32.960 --> 49:34.640
-Really?
-Yes.

49:34.720 --> 49:36.080
Promise, sweetheart?

49:36.160 --> 49:37.320
Yes, I promise.

49:42.000 --> 49:42.880
Hey!

49:43.840 --> 49:44.880
-Hey there!
-Hey!

50:00.520 --> 50:01.360
Rose?

50:02.840 --> 50:03.800
Hi.

50:03.880 --> 50:06.600
-Lulu, right?
-Yes. What are you doing here?

50:06.680 --> 50:09.400
I was passing by,
and I wanted to see Thibault.

50:09.480 --> 50:11.440
Do you know where he is?

50:11.520 --> 50:13.280
He finished his rounds.

50:13.360 --> 50:15.160
He should be in room 212.

50:15.240 --> 50:17.440
-Thanks a lot. See you.
-Ciao.

50:34.040 --> 50:34.880
Hi.

50:38.520 --> 50:41.040
You never call me, so I came to see you.

50:42.480 --> 50:43.840
What are you doing?

50:44.560 --> 50:47.080
I'm playing music for Michel.

50:47.640 --> 50:50.040
I'm hoping he comes out of his coma.

50:51.480 --> 50:52.360
Nice.

50:53.920 --> 50:54.880
We can go.

50:55.600 --> 50:57.200
-Yeah, okay.
-All right.

51:19.520 --> 51:21.200
My future clients?

51:22.000 --> 51:22.880
Yeah.

51:23.760 --> 51:24.800
Great to see you.

51:33.360 --> 51:34.200
Yeah.

51:35.080 --> 51:35.960
Me too.

51:37.200 --> 51:38.360
She's persistent.

51:39.240 --> 51:40.480
Can I see?

51:41.640 --> 51:42.720
No, but…

51:43.840 --> 51:45.720
You can't just read my texts.

51:46.600 --> 51:49.520
So, tell me.
What's it like dating a Kardashian?

51:51.120 --> 51:54.600
Well, it's good. We have fun.

51:55.720 --> 51:57.840
And how's your asshole boyfriend?

51:57.920 --> 51:59.160
Sorry?

51:59.240 --> 52:00.760
That's how you described him.

52:02.480 --> 52:04.480
We don't owe each other any explanation.

52:05.080 --> 52:07.680
Even if we're dating,
we can still be friends.

52:07.760 --> 52:09.560
I'm not at your beck and call.

52:10.160 --> 52:11.320
What's going on, Titi?

52:11.400 --> 52:13.520
Nothing, forget it.

52:14.480 --> 52:16.320
Call me, Thibault.

52:17.640 --> 52:18.520
Okay.

52:19.320 --> 52:20.680
All you had to do is ask.

52:21.680 --> 52:23.600
You don't seem happy to see me.

52:24.200 --> 52:26.840
I'll go.
Good luck with your little hottie.

52:41.080 --> 52:43.800
I caught a glimpse of their conversation.

52:45.880 --> 52:47.200
What's going on?

52:47.280 --> 52:49.760
I was saying, Rose left in a hurry.

52:50.560 --> 52:51.680
So, tell us.

52:51.760 --> 52:54.920
No, I don't know. She wanted to catch up.

52:55.440 --> 52:57.320
I was rude. She got upset.

52:57.400 --> 52:59.320
She's not angry. She's jealous.

52:59.400 --> 53:01.680
You don't have time for her anymore.

53:01.760 --> 53:04.640
Look who got himself
out of the friendzone!

53:04.720 --> 53:06.120
Way to go, Titi!

53:07.280 --> 53:09.360
Is Jennifer really into you?

53:10.640 --> 53:12.040
I don't know, kind of.

53:12.120 --> 53:13.120
Do you like her?

53:13.200 --> 53:14.360
Yes.

53:14.440 --> 53:16.120
But not as much as Rose.

53:16.200 --> 53:17.960
Why are you asking me this?

53:18.040 --> 53:20.320
Listen, Rose is jealous.

53:20.400 --> 53:23.480
Thanks to Maud,
we know her boyfriend is into lesbians.

53:23.560 --> 53:26.440
-Yeah.
-So, I have a plan to open her eyes.

53:26.520 --> 53:28.400
Now you're scaring me.

53:28.480 --> 53:29.960
I don't get it.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.200
What's the plan?

53:31.280 --> 53:34.920
You're going to use Jennifer
to spice things up with Rose.

53:35.520 --> 53:36.360
Great idea.

53:36.440 --> 53:38.720
No, we can't do that.

53:38.800 --> 53:42.360
I agree. We should never
play with people's feelings.

53:42.440 --> 53:43.600
Come on, guys.

53:43.680 --> 53:47.360
It's one week with Jennifer,
then you let her down gently.

53:48.360 --> 53:49.320
Easy to say.

53:49.400 --> 53:50.560
No.

53:50.640 --> 53:52.440
She'll bounce back.

53:52.520 --> 53:55.040
Don't worry. She gets plenty of offers.

53:55.120 --> 53:57.400
-You didn't promise her anything.
-No.

53:58.440 --> 53:59.480
Good.

54:00.120 --> 54:01.240
And so,

54:01.840 --> 54:03.280
Maud's going to trap Bruno.

54:04.600 --> 54:08.000
If you're patient and it works,
you'll get a second chance with Rose.

54:11.120 --> 54:12.480
Say something, Titi.

54:12.560 --> 54:13.400
Yes or no?

54:13.480 --> 54:15.000
Do you want Rose or not?

54:15.080 --> 54:16.520
-Make a call.
-Yes.

54:16.600 --> 54:17.600
-Say it.
-Okay.

54:17.680 --> 54:19.840
-Let's give it a shot.
-All right.

54:20.560 --> 54:21.400
Okay.

54:23.520 --> 54:29.240
KOOKY KIDS

54:37.640 --> 54:39.400
Can I help you?

54:39.480 --> 54:40.440
I'm sorry.

54:40.520 --> 54:43.840
You're right, I was rude,
and I've been avoiding you.

54:44.640 --> 54:45.680
Why?

54:45.760 --> 54:48.560
I was upset to see you back with your ex.

54:49.160 --> 54:52.040
But if you trust him, he must deserve it.

54:53.760 --> 54:55.080
I'm sorry too.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.120
I should never have judged you.

54:58.200 --> 54:59.840
I don't know her. I…

55:00.760 --> 55:02.160
So, are we friends?

55:02.840 --> 55:03.920
Of course.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.640
I'm having a costume party.

55:08.720 --> 55:09.960
Want to come?

55:10.040 --> 55:11.040
-Yes.
-With Bruno?

55:11.120 --> 55:12.440
-Yeah.
-Cool.

55:12.520 --> 55:15.640
I have to meet Jennifer.
We're having a picnic.

55:16.840 --> 55:17.720
Nice.

55:17.800 --> 55:19.160
-Yeah, bye.
-Cool.

55:19.240 --> 55:20.120
Bye.

55:49.520 --> 55:52.720
I'm telling you,
no longer than 20 minutes.

55:52.800 --> 55:54.400
Stop, I'm sure it'll be fun.

55:54.480 --> 55:56.320
Yeah, sure.

55:56.400 --> 55:58.920
The sick kids' nurse
is going to entertain us.

56:02.040 --> 56:03.320
Such a waste of time.

56:08.880 --> 56:09.880
Hello.

56:31.120 --> 56:32.440
That's them, go on.

56:37.320 --> 56:38.400
Hello, beautiful.

56:39.160 --> 56:40.360
Welcome.

56:48.640 --> 56:50.000
What kind of party is this?

56:50.720 --> 56:51.720
Thibault!

56:52.480 --> 56:53.680
Wait.

56:53.760 --> 56:55.360
He's dating Jennifer?

56:56.560 --> 56:57.760
You follow her?

56:57.840 --> 56:58.760
Sometimes.

57:03.120 --> 57:04.040
Rose, you came!

57:04.120 --> 57:04.960
Cool.

57:05.760 --> 57:07.720
Jennifer, this is my friend, Rose.

57:07.800 --> 57:09.800
And her boyfriend…

57:09.880 --> 57:11.440
-It's Bruno.
-Yeah.

57:11.520 --> 57:12.480
Welcome.

57:14.040 --> 57:15.520
What is this party?

57:15.600 --> 57:17.640
It's all thanks to my sweetheart.

57:19.240 --> 57:22.280
This isn't free.
I have to get back to my postings.

57:22.360 --> 57:23.600
Yeah.

57:24.200 --> 57:25.240
See you later!

57:25.920 --> 57:26.760
How are you?

57:26.840 --> 57:29.640
Remember the guy
who came to see my collection?

57:30.400 --> 57:31.240
Yeah.

57:31.320 --> 57:32.720
-He loved it.
-Really?

57:32.800 --> 57:35.600
He wants me to manage
the new kids' department.

57:35.680 --> 57:36.960
-Fantastic!
-But…

57:37.040 --> 57:39.200
He wants her to move to Spain,

57:39.280 --> 57:40.880
and I have a label to run.

57:42.120 --> 57:43.800
No, I can't accept,

57:43.880 --> 57:45.240
but I was flattered.

57:45.320 --> 57:46.160
Yeah.

57:47.240 --> 57:48.920
I'll leave you.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.720
-I need some shots.
-Okay.

57:54.120 --> 57:55.480
I'm so proud of you!

57:56.200 --> 57:57.280
Thanks.

57:57.360 --> 57:59.600
Baby, we're doing a live video.

58:01.280 --> 58:03.400
-Baby, come on!
-Go on.

58:35.680 --> 58:36.920
What am I doing?

58:37.000 --> 58:40.560
Don't worry.
Just a few photos, and then leave.

58:40.640 --> 58:41.880
I have to show a boob?

58:41.960 --> 58:44.040
So? Can we get started?

58:44.560 --> 58:47.000
Rose is bored. Her boyfriend's drunk.

58:47.080 --> 58:47.920
Yeah.

58:48.000 --> 58:48.960
Yes.

58:50.080 --> 58:51.080
For courage.

58:54.240 --> 58:55.680
-For Titi?
-Yes, for Titi.

59:03.440 --> 59:04.280
Hi, Rose.

59:04.960 --> 59:07.080
-Hi.
-I'm Alexandra, remember?

59:07.160 --> 59:08.160
Are you busy?

59:08.240 --> 59:09.160
No.

59:09.240 --> 59:11.640
Could you bring this to Thibault's room?

59:11.720 --> 59:15.600
I don't want anyone to steal it.
I need to get some ice.

59:15.680 --> 59:17.120
No problem. Where is it?

59:17.200 --> 59:18.160
Up one floor.

59:18.240 --> 59:20.040
-Okay.
-Thanks so much.

59:20.120 --> 59:21.000
Sure.

59:36.240 --> 59:38.520
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

59:38.600 --> 59:40.920
I tripped. I don't know. I'm sorry.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.120
Shit, but…

59:42.840 --> 59:46.120
Are you stupid or what? My dress!

59:48.480 --> 59:50.320
This really pisses me off!

59:52.080 --> 59:53.640
She's in your room.

1:00:31.440 --> 1:00:33.280
Are you snooping in my bedroom?

1:00:38.480 --> 1:00:39.440
Why children?

1:00:40.920 --> 1:00:42.840
I'm like them.

1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:45.960
There's no pretense.

1:00:46.040 --> 1:00:47.360
They're more direct.

1:00:48.840 --> 1:00:50.400
They tell you if they love you…

1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:55.400
or not.

1:00:59.800 --> 1:01:01.000
What's this?

1:01:01.560 --> 1:01:03.080
A hot night in the city?

1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:05.720
I sometimes go on Thursdays.

1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:08.520
So you dance.

1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:01.960
You drive me crazy.

1:02:07.520 --> 1:02:08.840
-Good shot?
-Perfect.

1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:10.960
Now, they have to heat things up.

1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:14.880
I remember what you said.
Is it really spectacular?

1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:16.080
A treasure.

1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:24.240
Shit.

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:33.160
So,

1:02:33.240 --> 1:02:35.080
we come close together.

1:02:35.160 --> 1:02:36.320
Your arm goes here,

1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:39.600
around my shoulders.
My foot between yours.

1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:40.720
There.

1:02:41.360 --> 1:02:42.240
Okay.

1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:43.320
Follow me?

1:02:43.840 --> 1:02:44.680
Okay.

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:49.360
I don't feel anything.

1:02:49.440 --> 1:02:51.160
Let me warm up.

1:02:51.240 --> 1:02:52.840
These things take time.

1:02:52.920 --> 1:02:55.520
I'm getting hot now. I feel it.

1:02:55.600 --> 1:02:56.640
Not bad.

1:02:59.680 --> 1:03:01.800
So, first, doggy style.

1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:03.960
-No worries.
-That's better.

1:03:04.040 --> 1:03:06.000
Easy now, yeah…

1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:08.000
No, but I can't feel anything.

1:03:09.200 --> 1:03:10.600
Now that's good.

1:03:10.680 --> 1:03:12.400
That's it. We got him.

1:03:14.560 --> 1:03:15.400
Yeah…

1:03:15.480 --> 1:03:16.960
This isn't working for me.

1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:22.240
Now, I'll post it,

1:03:22.320 --> 1:03:23.520
and we're done.

1:04:03.040 --> 1:04:05.560
Maybe we should join the others?

1:04:06.440 --> 1:04:08.160
Sure, if you want.

1:04:09.480 --> 1:04:10.360
Okay.

1:04:16.760 --> 1:04:18.560
I know what this is.

1:04:18.640 --> 1:04:21.280
No, you have no idea.

1:04:21.360 --> 1:04:23.360
Yeah, you want to see what I've got.

1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:24.960
No problem.

1:04:25.600 --> 1:04:28.000
Ready, here you go.

1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:32.760
So?

1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:41.560
It's not what you think.

1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:46.600
What's going on?

1:04:49.520 --> 1:04:51.280
You should show everyone.

1:04:59.600 --> 1:05:01.320
Idiot! Put that away!

1:05:05.760 --> 1:05:07.360
Thibault, wait.

1:05:07.440 --> 1:05:08.680
-Are you okay?
-Titi!

1:05:10.320 --> 1:05:11.560
And it's so small.

1:05:30.840 --> 1:05:32.880
Weren't we just planning photos?

1:05:32.960 --> 1:05:35.360
It's not my fault. The guy's an idiot.

1:05:39.960 --> 1:05:41.160
Thibault?

1:05:41.240 --> 1:05:42.680
What are you doing here?

1:05:43.320 --> 1:05:45.040
I wanted to make sure you're okay.

1:05:45.800 --> 1:05:47.080
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:05:48.840 --> 1:05:49.760
Come in.

1:05:55.320 --> 1:05:57.240
Thankfully, I still have my apartment.

1:06:00.640 --> 1:06:01.960
I feel so stupid.

1:06:02.040 --> 1:06:03.640
You had no way of knowing.

1:06:03.720 --> 1:06:04.840
No, I did.

1:06:04.920 --> 1:06:07.040
Why would he become a nice guy overnight?

1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:09.440
People don't change.

1:06:09.520 --> 1:06:11.040
No, you believed in him.

1:06:11.680 --> 1:06:12.520
It's cool.

1:06:14.040 --> 1:06:15.360
And people do change.

1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:17.920
Take it from me.

1:06:19.080 --> 1:06:20.760
Yeah, maybe in Siberia.

1:06:22.840 --> 1:06:23.720
Yeah.

1:06:24.600 --> 1:06:25.840
Why are you here?

1:06:26.920 --> 1:06:28.240
You're missing the party.

1:06:28.320 --> 1:06:30.160
I don't care.

1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:31.840
You're more important than that.

1:06:38.200 --> 1:06:39.600
Can you hold me?

1:06:58.440 --> 1:06:59.640
It's not a good idea.

1:06:59.720 --> 1:07:00.960
Why not?

1:07:01.040 --> 1:07:02.400
What about Jennifer?

1:07:02.480 --> 1:07:04.080
I don't care about her.

1:07:05.560 --> 1:07:06.600
That's classy.

1:07:07.400 --> 1:07:08.480
Doesn't she care?

1:07:08.560 --> 1:07:09.680
No…

1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:11.680
Do you think I need this now?

1:07:11.760 --> 1:07:13.320
Sorry, I wasn't thinking.

1:07:13.400 --> 1:07:15.280
I thought you were my friend.

1:07:16.760 --> 1:07:19.000
You just want to sleep with me?

1:07:19.080 --> 1:07:20.920
No, I mean, not at all.

1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:24.080
I'm pathetic.
I was about to fall for it again.

1:07:24.160 --> 1:07:25.800
-Rose--
-Please, go.

1:07:26.880 --> 1:07:28.240
-Rose--
-Just go!

1:08:00.600 --> 1:08:01.560
So?

1:08:02.400 --> 1:08:03.640
Where were you?

1:08:04.680 --> 1:08:07.360
Please, not now. I just want to go to bed.

1:08:07.440 --> 1:08:08.640
Where were you?

1:08:10.680 --> 1:08:11.960
I was with Rose.

1:08:12.040 --> 1:08:13.320
You want to leave me?

1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:15.880
For her?

1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:17.800
-Jennifer--
-Answer me.

1:08:21.720 --> 1:08:22.560
Yes.

1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:24.320
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1:08:24.400 --> 1:08:25.760
I tried to forget her--

1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:28.200
Me?

1:08:28.280 --> 1:08:30.320
Nobody dumps me.

1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:32.520
Do you know who I am?

1:08:33.120 --> 1:08:35.240
I'm the face of Etam.

1:08:35.320 --> 1:08:37.280
Rihanna follows me!

1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:41.600
I will not have some low-life nurse
leave me for some lame chick!

1:08:41.680 --> 1:08:44.200
I'm leaving you, you piece of shit!

1:08:46.800 --> 1:08:48.200
Fucking asshole!

1:08:48.280 --> 1:08:49.440
-Shit…
-Fuck you!

1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:51.120
-Fuckhead!
-Are you okay?

1:08:51.200 --> 1:08:52.840
How dare you!

1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:55.160
Seriously! Piece of shit!

1:08:58.400 --> 1:08:59.960
She's some piece of work.

1:09:00.040 --> 1:09:01.000
Asshole!

1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:06.040
Shit.

1:09:06.680 --> 1:09:08.480
What happened with Rose?

1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:09.560
She threw me out.

1:09:12.200 --> 1:09:14.160
I tried to kiss her.

1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:16.920
You needed to give it time.

1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.480
That was definitely in the friendzone.

1:09:19.560 --> 1:09:21.240
-Not very smart.
-Yeah.

1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:23.760
Not smart?

1:09:26.040 --> 1:09:27.400
And your shitty ideas?

1:09:27.480 --> 1:09:28.360
I'm sorry?

1:09:28.880 --> 1:09:31.040
But I was only trying to help.

1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:32.600
Help? How have you helped me?

1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:35.120
Tell me, how?

1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:36.680
-Seriously?
-But…

1:09:36.760 --> 1:09:37.760
Go on, tell me.

1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:40.040
Why do I follow your advice?

1:09:41.320 --> 1:09:43.560
You think you know everything,

1:09:43.640 --> 1:09:46.360
you're harsh, a slut,
and you hate your job.

1:09:46.440 --> 1:09:48.400
You act like a 16-year-old,

1:09:48.480 --> 1:09:50.120
and you're irresponsible.

1:09:50.200 --> 1:09:52.000
-Titi, don't be mean.
-Why?

1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:53.960
Does that upset you, Alex?

1:09:54.880 --> 1:09:56.240
I'm screwing up your plans?

1:09:56.320 --> 1:09:57.400
I'm out of line?

1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:01.040
I'm not allowed to be mean?

1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:03.400
Sorry, but friendship works both ways.

1:10:03.480 --> 1:10:05.760
I'm sick of being your guinea pig.

1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:06.680
That's enough.

1:10:14.040 --> 1:10:15.480
You got what you wanted.

1:10:16.040 --> 1:10:17.240
I've really changed.

1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:21.600
I'm not her friend,
I'll never be her boyfriend,

1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:23.720
and I've become an asshole.

1:12:41.720 --> 1:12:42.760
Are you finished?

1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:44.680
No, not yet.

1:12:46.400 --> 1:12:47.560
I wanted to tell you.

1:12:48.640 --> 1:12:50.400
I registered for med school.

1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:52.280
Cool.

1:12:53.640 --> 1:12:54.840
I'm happy for you.

1:12:56.960 --> 1:12:58.440
The girls are here.

1:12:59.040 --> 1:13:00.920
Alex had an obstetrician appointment.

1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:04.320
She didn't want me to tell you, but…

1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:06.800
she's pregnant.

1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:21.560
I'm so happy.

1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:23.160
I'm going to be an aunt.

1:13:24.080 --> 1:13:25.120
How's Thibault?

1:13:25.640 --> 1:13:26.560
Good.

1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:28.120
-I think so.
-Yeah.

1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:34.800
So, you're expecting a baby?

1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:36.000
Titi, you came.

1:13:37.360 --> 1:13:39.200
I mean, Thibault.

1:13:40.240 --> 1:13:41.840
Come here. I need a hug.

1:13:45.160 --> 1:13:47.000
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:51.840
My husband and I were wondering
if you'd be the godfather.

1:13:53.440 --> 1:13:54.320
Godfather?

1:13:54.840 --> 1:13:55.960
Yes, of course!

1:13:56.960 --> 1:13:57.800
Thanks.

1:13:58.960 --> 1:13:59.800
So,

1:14:00.320 --> 1:14:03.320
I couldn't help myself.
I did a bit of shopping.

1:14:03.400 --> 1:14:04.560
So sweet.

1:14:06.080 --> 1:14:08.360
First gift as a new mom.

1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:14.680
Wow. I love it.

1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:16.360
"Kooky Kids."

1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:18.080
-Rose's brand?
-Yes.

1:14:18.840 --> 1:14:22.200
Did you see on Facebook?
She's selling her couch.

1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:25.840
-I think she's moving to Spain for work.
-Okay.

1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:27.880
-That's cool.
-Yes.

1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:28.840
Good for her.

1:14:30.760 --> 1:14:32.600
I have to get back to work.

1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:34.920
Congratulations, Alex.

1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:36.000
Thanks.

1:14:36.880 --> 1:14:39.880
I'm really sorry about what I said.

1:14:39.960 --> 1:14:40.880
I wasn't thinking.

1:14:41.400 --> 1:14:43.040
You had a valid point.

1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:44.800
And, you know,

1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:46.440
we're sorry too.

1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:23.920
Why are you here?

1:15:26.080 --> 1:15:27.560
You've ignored my texts.

1:15:27.640 --> 1:15:28.840
You shouldn't have come.

1:15:28.920 --> 1:15:31.240
Sorry, but I like you.

1:15:31.760 --> 1:15:33.280
So, here I am.

1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:41.600
A stuffed toy? I'm not a baby!

1:15:46.680 --> 1:15:48.680
Can't you see? We need alone time.

1:16:09.480 --> 1:16:10.400
Are you okay?

1:16:11.160 --> 1:16:13.760
I have to see Rose. Fill in for me.

1:16:52.240 --> 1:16:54.880
He was the best friend ever.

1:16:56.920 --> 1:16:59.240
Always there to listen, to comfort,

1:17:00.120 --> 1:17:02.240
to get you through hard times.

1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:05.600
He was a great romantic,

1:17:05.680 --> 1:17:07.600
but his life was too short.

1:17:08.360 --> 1:17:10.000
He missed out on true love.

1:17:11.040 --> 1:17:12.800
God called him to His side.

1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:35.280
Don't worry. He pulled through.

1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:36.240
Thanks.

1:17:37.040 --> 1:17:37.960
Mr. Galland,

1:17:38.040 --> 1:17:42.080
you experienced a shock,
but nothing serious. I'll be right back.

1:17:49.520 --> 1:17:50.480
All right?

1:17:51.720 --> 1:17:52.760
How do you feel?

1:17:52.840 --> 1:17:54.600
You really gave us a scare.

1:17:54.680 --> 1:17:56.120
Lucky it happened here.

1:17:58.880 --> 1:18:00.120
What day is it?

1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:01.040
Time?

1:18:01.120 --> 1:18:03.480
It's Tuesday, 8:00 a.m.

1:18:03.560 --> 1:18:04.560
Rose is leaving.

1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:07.720
-Help me. I have to go.
-But you just got hit by a car.

1:18:09.160 --> 1:18:10.560
Come on!

1:18:15.680 --> 1:18:16.760
Hurry!

1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:20.960
Stop! Hey!

1:18:21.040 --> 1:18:22.080
Hurry up!

1:18:24.400 --> 1:18:26.400
Watch out, sir! Get out of the way!

1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:32.560
Brake!

1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:36.760
Let's go!

1:18:36.840 --> 1:18:38.000
Ready to go!

1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:08.480
Thibault, don't forget you have to--

1:19:32.120 --> 1:19:33.000
Rose.

1:19:35.160 --> 1:19:38.000
-What happened?
-It got hit by a car. It doesn't matter.

1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:39.720
Please, listen to me.

1:19:39.800 --> 1:19:41.040
I don't want to see you.

1:19:41.120 --> 1:19:42.200
Let me explain.

1:19:42.280 --> 1:19:43.480
There's nothing to say.

1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:46.880
Shit.

1:19:55.800 --> 1:19:56.800
What?

1:20:00.160 --> 1:20:01.080
Excuse me.

1:20:01.760 --> 1:20:03.480
Can you tell me the new code?

1:20:05.320 --> 1:20:07.440
Didn't you hear what she said?

1:20:08.120 --> 1:20:09.600
It's fine, guys.

1:20:09.680 --> 1:20:10.960
Come on.

1:20:12.400 --> 1:20:13.360
Get out of here!

1:20:13.440 --> 1:20:15.560
-Fine.
-We're working.

1:20:15.640 --> 1:20:16.600
But I'm injured.

1:20:16.680 --> 1:20:18.960
-Get out!
-Fine. I'm leaving.

1:20:33.080 --> 1:20:34.320
What's he doing?

1:20:44.240 --> 1:20:45.160
Rose.

1:20:47.240 --> 1:20:49.440
I know you can hear me. Please listen.

1:20:54.240 --> 1:20:56.160
I lied. I never went to Siberia.

1:21:00.240 --> 1:21:03.600
When we met, I fell in love,
but I didn't pursue it.

1:21:06.600 --> 1:21:09.160
I told myself you needed time,

1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:10.600
but I was just scared.

1:21:10.680 --> 1:21:12.520
I was afraid of rejection.

1:21:13.640 --> 1:21:15.720
When I decided to make my move,

1:21:15.800 --> 1:21:17.600
it was too late, we were friends.

1:21:20.960 --> 1:21:24.760
I wanted you to think of me differently,
so I reinvented myself.

1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:28.000
I tried to make you jealous.

1:21:33.400 --> 1:21:34.760
I wasn't jealous.

1:21:37.720 --> 1:21:40.200
Anyway, I don't want to be that guy.

1:21:40.280 --> 1:21:42.080
So what do you want?

1:21:42.160 --> 1:21:44.400
I don't care about all that posturing.

1:21:45.080 --> 1:21:47.880
And you shouldn't care either.
I know you, Rose.

1:21:47.960 --> 1:21:51.040
I know your qualities,
your flaws, and your fears.

1:21:51.120 --> 1:21:53.520
I've seen you when you're fragile.

1:21:54.520 --> 1:21:56.520
My feelings for you never changed.

1:22:00.800 --> 1:22:01.840
I love you.

1:22:06.280 --> 1:22:07.280
I love you.

1:22:10.360 --> 1:22:11.600
You know,

1:22:11.680 --> 1:22:16.520
if I hadn't been so stupid that night
on the beach, it could've been different.

1:22:18.840 --> 1:22:20.080
Give me a second chance.

1:22:21.080 --> 1:22:22.000
I changed.

1:22:22.080 --> 1:22:24.360
This time, it'll be the real me,

1:22:24.440 --> 1:22:26.600
without any lies, games, or pretense.

1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:31.040
That's crazy. I'm moving.

1:22:31.120 --> 1:22:33.440
So, I'll follow you. I don't care.

1:22:37.720 --> 1:22:39.720
Let me prove I can be more than a friend

1:22:40.240 --> 1:22:41.720
or a casual boyfriend.

1:22:46.760 --> 1:22:48.640
I could be the love of your life.

1:22:55.080 --> 1:22:56.360
It's 58.

1:22:58.960 --> 1:22:59.840
What?

1:23:03.760 --> 1:23:04.640
The code.

1:23:07.320 --> 1:23:08.400
Shit, the code!

1:23:36.760 --> 1:23:37.760
We did it!

1:23:45.480 --> 1:23:46.680
Our little darling!

1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:23.280
Where are you?

1:24:23.360 --> 1:24:24.800
On a beach in Barcelona.

1:24:26.120 --> 1:24:27.240
When are you back?

1:24:27.320 --> 1:24:30.080
I found a job at the Hospital del Mar.

1:24:30.160 --> 1:24:31.920
I told you she'd steal him away.

1:24:32.520 --> 1:24:34.440
Will you come for the baby's birth?

1:24:34.520 --> 1:24:36.640
Of course we'll be there.

1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:41.400
I've got to go.

1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:43.640
I love you.

1:24:43.720 --> 1:24:45.440
-Love you too.
-So do we.

1:24:45.520 --> 1:24:47.320
-Love you.
-Bye.

1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:33.840
