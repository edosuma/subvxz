worth all this?

Dan, I'm going to graduate,
pass the bar up north
and work in a DA's office.

00:07.875 --> 00:09.167
You're applying
for a scholarship?

I have one now,
for cheerleading.

All I can think about
is being with you.

prison for a minor burglary.

It's gotta be a frame-up job.

00:39.291 --> 00:40.917
That's the only thing
that makes sense.

00:40.917 --> 00:42.667
Bill Marsh is a powerful man
at this school

00:42.667 --> 00:45.000
and if we're gonna
go after him,
I need concrete proof.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.209
- Jake?
- Jake?

00:46.209 --> 00:47.500
So they caught Jake on tape

00:47.500 --> 00:50.125
and Marsh had Overton
cover it up and frame Travis.

00:50.125 --> 00:53.250
If I get this disc to Julian,
he can get Travis
out of prison.

00:53.250 --> 00:55.333
But then Jake
will go to prison instead.

but I was in too deep.

(Jake)
Bill Marsh had already
gotten people to lie for me.

01:01.458 --> 01:02.834

That I broke
into Bill Marsh's office

you had a very good reason

Alice Verdura, 19 years old,
alcohol poisoning.

11:19.625 --> 11:22.041
Okay, let's start her on
two large bore IVs
with saline.

11:22.041 --> 11:24.042
'She's gonna need
a gastric lavage.'

11:24.042 --> 11:25.917
You're gonna be okay, hon.

11:25.917 --> 11:28.792
[groaning]

11:28.792 --> 11:30.208
I just got my stomach pumped.

11:30.208 --> 11:33.375
I don't feel like being
yelled at right now.

11:35.708 --> 11:39.209
They call it parents' weekend
for a reason. I..

11:40.583 --> 11:44.167
I don't check my messages,
you should have been here.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.875
You should be here now.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.583
Don't..

11:52.042 --> 11:53.542
Don't even..

11:53.542 --> 11:56.834
If it was one of your boys
in the hospital,
you'd be here.

12:01.667 --> 12:03.209
(Vanessa)
'Knock, knock.'

12:06.708 --> 12:08.166
Who are you?

12:08.166 --> 12:11.500
I'm Vanessa Lodge.
I'm the new coach
for the Hellcats.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.959
We're competitive
collegiate cheerleaders.

12:13.959 --> 12:15.333
I know who the Hellcats are.

12:15.333 --> 12:18.166
You guys haven't qualified
in six years.

12:19.542 --> 12:23.167
I'm impressed
that you know that.

12:23.167 --> 12:26.166
So what's this?
A recruiting visit?

12:26.166 --> 12:28.792
Something like that.

12:28.792 --> 12:32.041
I'm gonna turn the Hellcats
into the champions
they used to be.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.167
Well, don't get so busy
with that

12:35.167 --> 12:37.500
you forget to feed
your pet unicorn.

12:37.500 --> 12:40.375
Your high school team
was Peachtree Classic champ

12:40.375 --> 12:41.458
three years running..

12:41.458 --> 12:42.625
Who told you that?

12:42.625 --> 12:46.084
I spoke to your old coach,
Marian.

12:46.084 --> 12:50.500
I came here to study
economics, learn
something about business.

12:50.500 --> 12:54.625
It's just, it's time
to put away
the childish things.

12:54.625 --> 12:57.458
You think that will make
your father respect you more?

13:00.208 --> 13:03.125
Marian's got a big mouth.

13:03.125 --> 13:05.042
So you don't
miss cheerleading.

13:05.042 --> 13:07.792
If it's as simple as that,
then just say so

13:07.792 --> 13:11.375
and, uh, I'll leave you alone
with your traumatized liver.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.667
It's as simple as that.

13:18.166 --> 13:20.542
I mean..

13:22.417 --> 13:24.667
...there's parts I miss.

13:25.875 --> 13:28.000
You miss the flying.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.167
I can see it on your face.

13:30.167 --> 13:32.208
You're a risk-taker.

13:33.125 --> 13:35.208
Just like me
when I was your age.

13:44.583 --> 13:47.458
What are you, my stalker?

13:47.458 --> 13:49.708
Well, I gave it up, too.

13:49.708 --> 13:51.083
Biggest mistake of my life.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.291
"Follow your bliss." Yeah.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.125
'I get it.'

13:57.625 --> 13:59.375
What?

13:59.375 --> 14:02.041
"Follow your bliss."
It's a funny expression.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.125
It's a   cliche.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.166
It's good advice, though.

14:07.166 --> 14:09.542
I moved on,
I've got a new life now.

14:10.041 --> 14:11.625
Yeah.

14:11.625 --> 14:14.250
How's that new life
working out for you?

14:17.084 --> 14:19.125
Fantastic.

14:23.166 --> 14:24.583
Okay, well,
if you change your mind--

14:24.583 --> 14:25.834
I won't.

14:25.834 --> 14:28.041
- You know where to find me.
- I don't need saving.

14:28.041 --> 14:30.291
Mm-hmm. You can keep the book.

14:32.042 --> 14:34.125
See you at practice.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.208
[sighs]

14:44.667 --> 14:48.417
I hate to admit it,
but Vanessa was right.

14:48.417 --> 14:51.375
I needed a change.
I needed saving.

14:51.375 --> 14:52.834
That's what
the Hellcats do, Marti.

14:52.834 --> 14:55.041
We're an institution
that saves people.

14:55.041 --> 14:58.042
'May it live forever.'

15:00.000 --> 15:01.083
Who's hungry?

15:01.083 --> 15:03.167
- I am.
- Whoo!

15:03.167 --> 15:05.166

15:13.959 --> 15:15.708

15:15.708 --> 15:17.500
It's nothing.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.792
Marti, please.
You can tell me.

15:22.125 --> 15:25.166
Oh, please,
just, just drop it.

15:25.166 --> 15:27.417
I'm fine.

15:38.208 --> 15:42.333
I'd handle this differently if
I could. You know that, right?

15:42.333 --> 15:45.542
I don't know any such thing.

15:45.542 --> 15:49.209
Hey, Lewis, tell Marti
what made you
join the Hellcats.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.792
Oh, no, no, no,
I have no interest

15:51.792 --> 15:53.333
in talking smack
about your boyfriend.

15:53.333 --> 15:56.333
- I think it's relevant.
- Relevant to what?

15:56.333 --> 15:59.500
To a problem
that Marti's sorting out.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.875
Anyhow,

16:01.875 --> 16:03.583

16:04.917 --> 16:09.042

- I dumped him this morning.

- Hey, jackass.

to play ball.

17:27.083 --> 17:29.583
You think I'm doing it
for the money?

17:29.583 --> 17:31.084
I don't need the cash.

18:02.959 --> 18:05.166
Yes, I know.

18:12.208 --> 18:14.875
You have to quit.

18:14.875 --> 18:16.917
Not if I want a degree.

18:16.917 --> 18:19.000
I-I need that scholarship,

Really? Oh, that's classic.

- Hey!

- I'm a wounded man here.
- Sorry.

18:45.417 --> 18:48.042

Oh, uh, top shelf.
Out of your reach,
I'll get 'em.

19:04.250 --> 19:06.083
Thanks.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.625
Okay, I get your point.
Thank you.

19:17.417 --> 19:19.875
So what made you
break it off with Jake?

19:21.875 --> 19:24.750
I knew
you'd be curious about that.

19:24.750 --> 19:27.458
Jake made a mistake.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.792
He forced me to choose
between loyalty to you

19:29.792 --> 19:31.250
and loyalty to him.

19:33.083 --> 19:35.708
You're a Hellcat..

19:35.708 --> 19:37.959

turned upside down.'

39:34.167 --> 39:36.000
I've been trying to make
this decision on my own

39:36.000 --> 39:39.042
but we're in this together.

39:39.042 --> 39:42.417
- 'We all decide.'
- 'All of us.'

39:42.417 --> 39:46.333
That's it. Okay, time's up.

39:46.333 --> 39:48.125
Marti needs to hear this.

39:48.125 --> 39:50.500
Knowing all that
we stand to lose..

39:51.125 --> 39:53.042
...do we have her back?

40:05.125 --> 40:09.208
If we're going out,
might as well go big.

40:39.667 --> 40:41.959
Let's bring the bastards down.

40:46.166 --> 40:47.959
Hellcats.

40:49.042 --> 40:50.875
Hellcats.
