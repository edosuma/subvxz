WEBVTT

01:28.077 --> 01:29.278
Gotcha!

01:29.746 --> 01:32.282
You know you shouldn't be
reading this on your own?

01:35.117 --> 01:37.186
It'll give you nightmares.

01:37.219 --> 01:39.555
Please Mum, just one story!

01:39.688 --> 01:43.425
What about the Werewolf?
Or the Wendigo? I like that one!

01:43.459 --> 01:46.662
Ah! Here we go.

01:48.597 --> 01:52.433
The Grota was a savage
and powerful beast.

01:52.467 --> 01:56.304
One day a brave young Warrior,

01:56.337 --> 01:58.406
just like you,

01:58.439 --> 02:00.642
came passing through the village.

02:00.675 --> 02:06.447
She alone decided that all monsters,
no matter how scary,

02:06.481 --> 02:08.348
could be defeated.

02:08.383 --> 02:12.787
The warrior fought long and
hard but the monster was strong

02:12.820 --> 02:13.921
and vicious.

02:13.955 --> 02:16.724
She picked her moment, took her sword

02:16.758 --> 02:21.763
and with one thrust, jabbed
the monster in its weakest spot!

02:21.796 --> 02:22.930
And...

02:22.964 --> 02:24.464
Boom!

02:26.734 --> 02:28.635
But that's enough for tonight.

02:45.786 --> 02:47.621
Mum?

02:50.657 --> 02:52.859
Be quiet for Mum Pumpkin.

03:31.897 --> 03:35.568
Mum?

03:49.414 --> 03:50.849
Sophie!

04:04.863 --> 04:07.999
Sophie.

04:09.701 --> 04:12.804
Sophie.

04:13.772 --> 04:15.305
Sophie.

04:18.076 --> 04:19.576
Sophie!

04:50.674 --> 04:52.743
Lesbo.

04:54.744 --> 04:57.480
This is so boring!

04:57.513 --> 05:00.951
Right! Everyone put your pens down.

05:01.417 --> 05:03.719
Stop writing!

05:03.753 --> 05:08.624
It seems Mona can't go five minutes
without wanting everyone's attention.

05:08.658 --> 05:12.495
So I want everybody to look at her.

05:13.129 --> 05:15.398
Look at her!

05:16.566 --> 05:20.036
You're the reason
this school is struggling.

05:20.069 --> 05:23.840
A dedicated student
raises their class up.

05:23.873 --> 05:29.578
A fool drags it down and you Mona
are making the whole class fail.

05:29.611 --> 05:31.080
That's not true sir.

05:31.113 --> 05:34.583
Sophie don't defend her,
you're better than that.

05:35.151 --> 05:36.351
Listen freak!

05:36.384 --> 05:38.987
Why don't you go and mess up
your own life somewhere else?

05:39.021 --> 05:40.956
Some of us actually have a future.

05:40.989 --> 05:42.225
Yeah Arya.

05:42.258 --> 05:45.894
And your's involves taking it
from three guys on pay per view.

05:45.927 --> 05:47.462
Slut!

05:47.495 --> 05:49.564
Right! Straight to the head's office!

05:50.498 --> 05:52.567
I'm gone!

06:00.507 --> 06:03.377
OK everyone, back to work.

06:04.578 --> 06:07.849
You have fifteen minutes.

06:20.628 --> 06:22.062
Go and speak to her.

06:22.096 --> 06:23.964
You're still here then?

06:23.998 --> 06:26.567
Thanks. Mrs Harris loves me.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.435
She won't kick me out.

06:28.769 --> 06:31.872
Hey. I've got something for you.

06:31.906 --> 06:34.440
My brother is a right computer nerd.

06:34.474 --> 06:35.776
No offense Beth.

06:38.245 --> 06:39.914
What the fuck?

06:39.947 --> 06:41.849
Oh you look pretty.

06:43.317 --> 06:45.818
No! No way you can't hand those out!

06:45.852 --> 06:47.587
It's a bit late for that.

06:47.620 --> 06:50.890
Been giving them out all morning.
Even gave Mrs Harris one!

06:50.924 --> 06:52.425
She can't make it though.

06:55.762 --> 06:56.763
Come to Sophie's party!

06:57.797 --> 06:59.165
I'm just getting the word out.

06:59.198 --> 07:01.567
I said a few people, not
the whole bloody school.

07:01.601 --> 07:03.603
You're only eighteen once!

07:03.636 --> 07:07.640
Besides, it will be the perfect
opportunity to pull Jess.

07:14.814 --> 07:16.615
Stuff this.

07:18.217 --> 07:21.520
Cancel your plans tonight party people
because there is only one place to be.

07:22.621 --> 07:24.589
What the hell?

07:24.623 --> 07:25.691
Sophie's having a party?

07:25.724 --> 07:27.126
And it's going to be banging.

07:27.160 --> 07:29.195
Professional DJ, booze on tap.

07:29.228 --> 07:31.530
Loads of hot lads.

07:31.563 --> 07:32.831
And lasses.

07:32.864 --> 07:35.567
This looks great.

07:36.001 --> 07:36.635
I'm in.

07:36.668 --> 07:38.537
Babe?

07:38.570 --> 07:40.739
It will be fun.

07:40.772 --> 07:42.708
I'll put you on the guest list.

07:42.741 --> 07:44.242
Get there for eight.

07:44.276 --> 07:46.544
Don't be late!

07:48.647 --> 07:49.580
Brice.

07:49.613 --> 07:51.682
Phone!

07:54.585 --> 07:55.854
What are you doing?

07:55.887 --> 07:58.789
I'm extending Sophie's invitation.

07:58.823 --> 08:01.659
Giving that Muff Diver a birthday treat.

08:03.328 --> 08:04.795
Hello?

08:04.829 --> 08:07.932
I'd like to make
a booking for tonight.

08:14.071 --> 08:17.141
Absinthe has been a party staple
since like Medieval times.

08:17.174 --> 08:19.243
It's a social lubricant.
Gets everyone in the mood.

08:19.276 --> 08:21.812
Oh? So who have you got
your eye on tonight?

08:22.813 --> 08:24.914
What about that skater lad in Geography?
Is he coming?

08:24.915 --> 08:28.252
Oh God no! He's well greasy.

08:31.122 --> 08:33.190
What are you doing?

08:41.298 --> 08:44.601
I heard you say you were
going to have a party.

08:45.602 --> 08:49.639
You only turn eighteen once
so I wanted to make it special.

08:50.707 --> 08:52.776
Thanks Dad.

09:06.189 --> 09:07.257
Dad?

09:07.290 --> 09:09.625
Can I have a word please?

09:09.658 --> 09:11.127
In private?

09:11.161 --> 09:13.695
Come on Beth.
Lets go get the drinks ready.

09:17.167 --> 09:19.302
Thank you.

09:19.335 --> 09:21.603
Thanks.

09:31.713 --> 09:33.315
I'm very proud of you.

09:33.348 --> 09:34.016
Dad.

09:34.049 --> 09:35.150
Listen!

09:35.184 --> 09:38.821
I know you don't want to hear
your old man banging on.

09:38.854 --> 09:41.790
You're a special kid pumpkin.

09:41.824 --> 09:44.625
You've got so much potential.

09:45.194 --> 09:47.329
You're just like her.

09:47.362 --> 09:49.630
My friends are here.

09:50.199 --> 09:52.334
I'm not going to embarrass you.

09:59.308 --> 10:01.642
I've held on to this for too long.

10:02.377 --> 10:04.645
It's the book she used to read me.

10:05.847 --> 10:07.348
I don't want it!

10:07.381 --> 10:09.817
Mum would want you to have it!

10:19.793 --> 10:21.929
We used to call it the Book of Monsters.

10:21.963 --> 10:23.998
Oh, that's it!

10:24.031 --> 10:26.100
I liked the pictures.

10:26.766 --> 10:30.171
It' wasn't my first choice
for bed time stories

10:30.904 --> 10:32.306
but your mother was

10:33.274 --> 10:35.343
unconventional.

10:37.711 --> 10:39.880
That's why I married her.

10:40.548 --> 10:42.082
I know I don't measure up.

10:42.115 --> 10:43.283
Dad.

10:44.784 --> 10:46.853
I do love you.

10:47.921 --> 10:49.990
And, I miss her too.

11:01.034 --> 11:03.002
I'll get out of your hair.

11:03.035 --> 11:04.904
Don't go too crazy tonight.

11:04.937 --> 11:07.006
It will be very tame.

11:07.507 --> 11:09.775
I'll see you downstairs.

11:49.948 --> 11:52.283
So what have you three
got planned for this evening?

11:52.317 --> 11:54.986
Oh, you know!
Just a quiet night in with the girls.

11:55.554 --> 11:57.822
Bed by midnight, OK?

12:02.293 --> 12:04.362
Bye!

12:09.067 --> 12:10.969
He has no idea.

12:24.815 --> 12:26.183
This is shit!

12:26.216 --> 12:28.285
I knew no one would come.
No one ever comes here!

12:28.852 --> 12:31.054
Don't be like that!

12:31.088 --> 12:33.156
It's still early.

12:48.871 --> 12:50.474
Well!

12:50.507 --> 12:52.775
This is shabby.

12:53.377 --> 12:54.810
Get me some wine!

12:54.844 --> 12:57.380
You can put your coats over there
and there is drinks on the side and...

12:58.415 --> 13:00.116
Or you could just do that.

13:00.149 --> 13:02.218
See. Party central.

13:02.251 --> 13:03.852
Who are these people,
they don't go to our school?

13:03.853 --> 13:05.921
Relax!

13:07.056 --> 13:09.125
Hello handsome.

13:12.061 --> 13:14.130
Hey.

13:15.965 --> 13:16.999
Thanks.

13:17.033 --> 13:18.000
Cool party.

13:38.253 --> 13:40.589
Hi Sophie. Thanks for inviting me.

13:40.623 --> 13:42.424
Drink?

13:42.457 --> 13:44.593
We're in Geography together.

13:44.627 --> 13:45.627
I sat next to you last year.

13:45.628 --> 13:48.863
Oh! Sorry, of course.
What's your name again?

13:48.897 --> 13:50.899
That's OK, it's Gary.

13:50.932 --> 13:53.001
Chug, chug, chug!

13:53.601 --> 13:55.869
Oh, this was a bad idea.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.010
Thanks for the drink Gavin!

14:04.346 --> 14:06.414
It's Gary.

14:06.448 --> 14:08.516
OK.

14:49.989 --> 14:50.956
Hey! I'm still drinking that!

14:50.957 --> 14:53.025
You're welcome!

15:06.572 --> 15:08.641
Watch this.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.319
Happy birthday!

15:25.190 --> 15:27.259
Stay Hydrated!

15:28.260 --> 15:29.428
Oh Shit.

15:38.637 --> 15:40.705
You alright?

15:45.043 --> 15:46.278
For the beer.

15:46.311 --> 15:48.380
Thanks.

15:54.084 --> 15:57.021
I'm sorry about Brice and Arya.

15:57.054 --> 15:59.123
Why do you hang around with them?

16:05.029 --> 16:07.097
Yo

16:12.570 --> 16:14.438
Who are you big man?

16:14.472 --> 16:15.739
That was horrible.

16:20.444 --> 16:22.480
Don't get up, big man!

16:23.180 --> 16:23.880
What a looser!

16:23.881 --> 16:26.350
I swear...

16:26.383 --> 16:28.117
You know what I mean? What the fuck?

16:28.152 --> 16:30.354
Sorry.

16:31.322 --> 16:33.390
Hi.

17:03.453 --> 17:05.755
I had two currys last night,
I'm really sorry.

17:07.323 --> 17:08.257
Em...

17:09.291 --> 17:11.326
It's cool of your Dad
to let us have a party.

17:11.361 --> 17:13.295
He doesn't know.

17:13.328 --> 17:15.528
God. He's going to kill me
when he sees the state of it.

17:17.266 --> 17:19.568
Well, then you might as well
enjoy your last night.

17:26.474 --> 17:28.076
Oh my God! What is that?

17:28.109 --> 17:30.178
Lightweight.

17:47.328 --> 17:50.231
Wait, no wait, that's my bedroom!

17:51.900 --> 17:54.268
Never mind.

17:54.302 --> 17:56.370
I know a good dry cleaners.

17:57.271 --> 17:59.340
For your sheets.

17:59.574 --> 18:01.642
Eww!

18:02.476 --> 18:04.545
Come on, lets go back inside.

18:07.248 --> 18:09.317
So what class are you in?

18:12.753 --> 18:14.822
What are you looking for?

18:36.710 --> 18:38.778
Sophie! The Police are here!

18:38.813 --> 18:39.446
What?

18:39.479 --> 18:40.780
They're at the front door.

18:40.814 --> 18:42.917
You'll have to answer it!

18:46.886 --> 18:49.155
Are you Sophie?

18:49.556 --> 18:51.791
I'm afraid we've had
reports of a disturbance.

18:51.825 --> 18:53.860
I'm gonna have to place you
under arrest.

18:53.893 --> 18:56.161
For what crime?

18:56.195 --> 18:58.297
A crime of passion!

19:30.829 --> 19:32.898
So you're a big re/ Big reader then?

19:38.470 --> 19:40.539
I like reading.

19:40.739 --> 19:42.808
I like reading fantasy novels.

19:51.282 --> 19:53.351
I'm going to a book signing soon.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.566
Tell me.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.902
Are you a Virgin?

20:10.935 --> 20:12.870
I've never kissed a girl before.

20:13.604 --> 20:15.673
Thought so.

20:35.726 --> 20:37.794
Oh shit son!

20:56.980 --> 20:59.248
What are you...

21:11.527 --> 21:13.562
Fuck this.

21:13.596 --> 21:15.664
Whoo!

21:16.899 --> 21:18.901
You're done hot stuff.

21:18.934 --> 21:20.301
Kill the music!

21:21.771 --> 21:23.906
Show's over.

21:23.939 --> 21:26.307
Just when she was
getting a taste for it!

22:03.511 --> 22:05.580
Enjoy that did you?

22:05.914 --> 22:07.081
I thought you were different.

22:07.115 --> 22:09.818
I'm sorry kid, I was just told
to show you a good time.

22:09.851 --> 22:10.517
Fuck off.

22:10.551 --> 22:12.686
Fair enough.

22:12.719 --> 22:13.654
Mona just leave it.

22:13.687 --> 22:15.123
She deserves it.

22:15.156 --> 22:17.391
Listen to your freak Mona.

22:17.424 --> 22:18.926
What is your problem?

22:18.960 --> 22:21.695
Sophie's gay, get over it.

22:21.728 --> 22:23.797
Gay is the least of her worries.

22:23.997 --> 22:27.501
We all know about little
Sophie's trip to the looney bin.

22:31.471 --> 22:33.540
Oh, yeah. Didn't you know?

22:35.542 --> 22:39.445
Sophie thinks the Bogey Man
killed her Mummy.

22:39.478 --> 22:41.982
Even her Dad thought she was crazy.

22:42.015 --> 22:44.650
Sent her to a mental Hospital
for a year!

22:44.685 --> 22:47.486
My parents still think he did it.

22:47.520 --> 22:51.824
But maybe Sophie snapped and
chopped Mummy up into little pieces?

22:51.858 --> 22:53.927
You bitch!

23:01.634 --> 23:03.803
Oh now you're going to get it.

23:52.918 --> 23:53.919
Hey guys!

23:55.153 --> 23:57.022
Am I late for a party?

24:26.717 --> 24:27.483
Oh God!

24:41.531 --> 24:43.700
Anders!

24:44.968 --> 24:45.868
Look out man!

24:54.110 --> 24:54.744
No!

24:56.879 --> 24:57.847
Oh fuck!

25:02.251 --> 25:03.052
Guys come on!

25:07.290 --> 25:09.192
Arya!

25:09.225 --> 25:10.026
Arya, what the fuck?

25:10.059 --> 25:12.829
Stripper Guy! Stripper Guy, help me!

25:12.862 --> 25:14.130
My hands!

25:15.031 --> 25:16.933
What the fuck are you doing?

25:29.644 --> 25:31.713
Come on.

25:42.157 --> 25:44.226
Sophie! Come on, come on!

25:46.094 --> 25:47.695
Sophie!

25:47.728 --> 25:48.130
Beth!

25:48.163 --> 25:49.998
Get out! Run!

25:50.664 --> 25:51.632
Come on!

26:05.946 --> 26:06.781
Tanya.

26:08.649 --> 26:10.718
I had math class with her.

26:16.791 --> 26:17.758
Where now?

26:17.792 --> 26:19.860
In here!

26:31.038 --> 26:33.107
You'll be safe here.

26:34.408 --> 26:39.045
A monster! A fucking monster!
A big fucking monster!

26:39.079 --> 26:40.448
Help me!

26:40.481 --> 26:43.082
You get a lap dance and full frontal!
You didn't pay me for this shit!

26:43.083 --> 26:44.851
Help me!

26:45.919 --> 26:47.987
This way!

26:53.159 --> 26:55.228
Come on. We need to get help.

26:57.097 --> 26:58.998
Wait.

26:59.032 --> 27:01.101
Who is that?

27:06.972 --> 27:09.041
Run!

27:13.779 --> 27:14.812
We need to call the police.

27:14.813 --> 27:16.081
I already have.

27:16.115 --> 27:16.782
What?

27:16.815 --> 27:18.050
But you weren't even there.

27:18.083 --> 27:19.419
I heard what was going on.

27:19.452 --> 27:21.720
What are you doing?

27:23.422 --> 27:26.658
We need to keep safe.
Until the police arrive.

27:26.692 --> 27:27.793
Not by locking us in.

27:27.826 --> 27:29.728
It's the best way to keep safe!

27:29.761 --> 27:31.096
No!

27:31.130 --> 27:31.662
Stop!

27:32.865 --> 27:34.933
Who are you?

27:52.417 --> 27:53.651
Check the back door.

27:53.684 --> 27:56.921
This was meant to be a friendly party,
a friendly atmosphere!

27:56.954 --> 27:58.856
Check the back door!

27:58.890 --> 28:00.091
You check the back door!

28:00.124 --> 28:03.227
I'm going to call the police.
Have you got a phone on you?

28:06.998 --> 28:09.066
I'll check the back door.

28:11.369 --> 28:15.273
Come on, come on you piece of shit!

28:17.275 --> 28:19.477
Hello, Police?

28:19.510 --> 28:21.412
I have to be quick so please listen.

28:21.445 --> 28:24.448
My house is being robbed right now!

28:24.482 --> 28:28.286
I live at Hollow Farm.
Down the valley through Hollow Wood.

28:28.319 --> 28:30.388
Please hurry!

28:33.023 --> 28:34.491
We're not being robbed, we're
being killed!

28:36.193 --> 28:37.994
And what was I supposed to say?

28:38.028 --> 28:40.997
That a giant fucking monster has
killed half our classmates?

28:41.031 --> 28:42.933
I don't think they'd believe that.

28:42.966 --> 28:45.035
I don't believe that.

28:45.235 --> 28:47.304
Yeah, OK that's pretty clever.

28:48.038 --> 28:49.906
Find the key!

29:06.389 --> 29:08.257
I'm calling the police.

29:08.290 --> 29:09.758
No!

29:09.792 --> 29:10.893
What the hell?

29:10.926 --> 29:12.328
We need to keep safe!

29:12.361 --> 29:14.830
What the fuck is wrong with you?

29:17.900 --> 29:19.835
You bastard!

29:36.585 --> 29:38.853
Wait here.

29:53.201 --> 29:55.270
Sophie?

29:56.971 --> 29:59.040
I know what it is.

30:00.308 --> 30:02.310
That can't be right,
how can that be right?

30:02.343 --> 30:04.412
Sophie, what is it?

30:04.979 --> 30:06.847
I...

30:06.880 --> 30:08.949
I've seen it before.

30:09.350 --> 30:11.419
Not in the flesh but

30:12.052 --> 30:13.554
in a book.

30:15.490 --> 30:16.790
Ooh!

30:16.990 --> 30:19.059
Do you have a hair clip?

30:21.462 --> 30:24.532
I've had to break myself out of
my own handcuffs a few times.

30:29.503 --> 30:30.504
Idiot!

30:40.580 --> 30:42.882
It can't be real.

30:42.915 --> 30:44.984
What book was this?

30:45.885 --> 30:49.055
It was something my Mum
used to read me before bed.

30:49.088 --> 30:50.390
I don't understand.

30:50.424 --> 30:52.492
How do we kill it?

30:55.429 --> 30:58.431
There is something.
Something I remember.

31:01.601 --> 31:03.869
There's a spot.

31:03.903 --> 31:05.971
A weak spot.

31:07.506 --> 31:09.575
On its back.

31:19.318 --> 31:21.287
I saw it, it's there.

31:21.487 --> 31:22.588
I know how to kill it.

31:23.955 --> 31:25.358
Trust me.

31:25.391 --> 31:27.460
Just have to hit that spot.

31:28.527 --> 31:30.596
With what?

31:42.207 --> 31:43.942
We should stick together.

31:43.975 --> 31:46.044
Fuck you!

32:23.614 --> 32:24.648
Argh!

32:55.511 --> 32:57.346
No one steals my look!

33:36.117 --> 33:37.419
Wait here OK.

34:00.307 --> 34:01.475
Shit!

34:13.721 --> 34:15.456
What are those little bastards?

34:16.924 --> 34:18.626
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
they're doing something!

34:29.503 --> 34:31.572
Shit!

34:36.810 --> 34:39.245
You have got to be fucking kidding me!

34:39.279 --> 34:40.079
No!

34:40.681 --> 34:42.114
No, no, no, no, no, no!

34:42.715 --> 34:43.716
Fuck off!

34:50.523 --> 34:51.023
Kill them!

34:59.032 --> 34:59.866
Weeee!

35:06.138 --> 35:07.372
No, no, no, noooo!

35:35.867 --> 35:36.368
Huhh!

35:38.604 --> 35:39.604
Open the Microwave!

35:44.275 --> 35:46.477
Weeeeee.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.781
Fry you fucker!

35:50.849 --> 35:51.883
Get back here!

35:54.585 --> 35:55.519
Where's the last one?

36:18.876 --> 36:21.211
Over here!

36:48.304 --> 36:49.673
Get off him!

36:57.246 --> 36:59.314
Whooo!

37:07.489 --> 37:08.958
Who are you?

37:10.859 --> 37:12.929
I'm Gary.

37:14.930 --> 37:17.299
Good job Greg.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.435
Lets get the fuck out of here!

37:21.437 --> 37:22.538
Back inside. Now!

37:23.739 --> 37:25.808
How many of those things are there?

37:25.841 --> 37:27.910
In here, it's safe!

37:32.346 --> 37:34.883
We need to barricade the door.
There's more outside.

37:36.417 --> 37:37.853
You came back.

37:38.419 --> 37:39.755
Grant here just saved our lives.

37:41.656 --> 37:43.725
Lets get this place secure.

37:48.296 --> 37:49.864
Has anyone seen Mona?

38:03.544 --> 38:04.011
What?

38:04.045 --> 38:06.313
Easy.

38:07.081 --> 38:09.316
You took quite a blow.

38:10.852 --> 38:11.652
That guy?

38:11.686 --> 38:13.688
Yeah. Not a guy.

38:13.721 --> 38:15.790
Some kind of fucking monster.

38:15.823 --> 38:18.926
He took a beating and
then took to the window.

38:19.794 --> 38:21.863
God knows where he,

38:22.429 --> 38:24.498
She.

38:24.865 --> 38:26.933
Is now.

38:28.769 --> 38:30.771
Come on.

38:30.804 --> 38:32.873
Lets get the hell out of here.

39:11.844 --> 39:13.412
Listen.

39:13.445 --> 39:15.481
I will get you out of here.

39:16.448 --> 39:17.917
I promise.

39:17.950 --> 39:20.019
You throw a shit party.

39:21.520 --> 39:23.521
Arya.

39:23.555 --> 39:25.623
I'm really sorry for your loss.

39:26.058 --> 39:26.658
Brice was/

39:26.692 --> 39:28.961
Brice was a fucking idiot.

39:32.998 --> 39:36.634
But his Dad had a Porsche.
He let us drive it sometimes.

39:37.036 --> 39:39.104
He didn't deserve to die.

39:41.039 --> 39:42.407
Just give me that.

39:42.440 --> 39:44.509
I'll take it, let go.

39:52.116 --> 39:54.384
Mona!

39:58.122 --> 40:00.124
Are you OK?

40:00.158 --> 40:01.826
I'm fine.

40:02.526 --> 40:04.595
She needs a seat.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.668
What's that Mona?

40:12.903 --> 40:14.972
Why have you go that?

40:15.639 --> 40:17.708
I thought it might be useful.

40:19.210 --> 40:21.478
What do you mean, useful?

40:22.079 --> 40:23.881
This is really old.

40:25.082 --> 40:26.483
Hey guys!

40:26.516 --> 40:28.585
The Police are here!

40:52.175 --> 40:54.844
Car fifteen responding
to call from Hollow Farm.

40:56.712 --> 40:58.781
Holy shit.

40:58.814 --> 41:00.883
You know where we are, right?

41:01.550 --> 41:02.751
Yeah, in the middle of fucking nowhere.

41:02.752 --> 41:03.986
No!

41:04.020 --> 41:06.088
Ten years ago, Homicide.

41:06.822 --> 41:09.759
Late one night, Dad goes home,

41:09.792 --> 41:13.162
Finds his wife chopped to bits
under his kid's bed.

41:13.195 --> 41:15.463
It was all over the papers.

41:15.831 --> 41:17.900
Kid saw the whole thing.

41:18.533 --> 41:20.236
Only eight years old.

41:20.269 --> 41:22.171
Fucking hell.

41:22.204 --> 41:23.571
They caught the guy, right?

41:23.605 --> 41:25.141
No.

41:25.174 --> 41:27.442
And that's not the strangest thing.

41:27.909 --> 41:29.978
According to the kid,

41:30.545 --> 41:32.614
it wasn't a guy at all.

41:35.784 --> 41:37.852
It was...

41:38.053 --> 41:38.520
A monster!

41:40.922 --> 41:43.091
Wanker!

41:43.124 --> 41:45.193
Fuck.

41:48.529 --> 41:50.564
Stay here Rookie.

41:50.597 --> 41:52.666
I'll go and check out the place.

42:04.145 --> 42:06.214
Fuck you Keith.

42:08.515 --> 42:11.719
Help me!

42:12.119 --> 42:14.039
Keith, this is not the time
to be fucking around.

42:15.556 --> 42:15.956
My God!

42:15.990 --> 42:17.291
Monster!

42:25.799 --> 42:27.868
Shit!

42:35.608 --> 42:37.677
Oh, come on!

43:14.613 --> 43:16.681
Oh, shit!

43:18.217 --> 43:20.286
Shit.

43:48.913 --> 43:50.981
We're on our own.

43:52.250 --> 43:53.285
Found anything?

43:53.318 --> 43:57.655
I've barely scratched
the surface but here, look.

43:59.156 --> 44:00.291
Our party crasher.

44:00.325 --> 44:02.593
No, this!

44:02.960 --> 44:05.029
That's Mum's handwriting.

44:06.130 --> 44:07.832
Where did your Mum get this?

44:07.865 --> 44:09.633
I don't know.

44:09.667 --> 44:11.735
It's been around our house for years.

44:12.236 --> 44:13.602
I think it might have been my Grandma's.

44:13.603 --> 44:16.283
It doesn't matter where the book
came from if it's got some answers!

44:24.714 --> 44:25.715
Jess.

44:25.748 --> 44:27.384
The monster in my bedroom.

44:27.418 --> 44:29.686
What did it look like?

44:30.086 --> 44:31.821
How should I know?

44:31.855 --> 44:33.257
I was unconscious.

44:33.290 --> 44:35.359
But you saw something, right?

44:36.025 --> 44:38.094
I don't know.

44:38.962 --> 44:41.030
I remember the sound of breaking glass.

45:10.426 --> 45:12.694
Bitch.

45:28.277 --> 45:30.345
Fuck!

45:53.467 --> 45:55.903
That looks like the one
that killed the police.

45:56.904 --> 45:58.806
It's got us all trapped in here
with no way out.

45:58.839 --> 46:00.841
Jess, hang on.

46:00.875 --> 46:03.077
According to Gary.

46:03.110 --> 46:05.179
That thing.

46:05.513 --> 46:07.781
Released these worms.

46:08.782 --> 46:10.750
And we're all familiar with that one.

46:12.386 --> 46:14.422
I never want to meet that one.

46:14.455 --> 46:16.856
Wait.

46:16.890 --> 46:18.959
This symbol.

46:25.865 --> 46:28.802
It's on all of the pages of the monsters
we've seen tonight.

46:29.970 --> 46:31.938
I've seen that symbol before.

46:44.184 --> 46:46.253
To summon the five.

46:46.819 --> 46:48.887
A sacrifice must be made.

46:51.258 --> 46:53.326
Only the blood of a Virgin.

46:53.892 --> 46:55.961
On the eve of.

47:00.367 --> 47:02.535
A ritual sacrifice.

47:02.569 --> 47:04.837
On the eve of what?

47:08.140 --> 47:10.209
Five points.

47:13.846 --> 47:15.481
Five monsters.

47:15.514 --> 47:17.916
All with this symbol.

47:17.950 --> 47:20.019
And we've seen three of them.

47:21.186 --> 47:23.255
Which means there's
still two more to come.

47:24.590 --> 47:27.526
If someone performed a ritual sacrifice.

47:27.559 --> 47:29.827
Then whose blood is that?

47:32.331 --> 47:35.066
What about that geeky guy
in the Hawaiian shirt?

47:35.099 --> 47:37.168
He was probably a Virgin.

47:37.201 --> 47:39.270
At least, until he went
into your bedroom.

47:41.239 --> 47:43.308
The girl in red.

47:43.541 --> 47:44.710
Wait, no.

47:44.743 --> 47:47.612
When me and Mona went into
your room, that guy was fine.

47:47.645 --> 47:50.181
The girl wasn't there.
How do you explain that?

47:50.581 --> 47:52.950
Unless.

47:52.984 --> 47:54.619
It's a Shape-shifter.

48:01.225 --> 48:03.294
Are you OK?

48:03.994 --> 48:06.063
That's the one that killed Mum.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.069
She wrote some notes in the margins.

48:13.136 --> 48:15.839
Cunning and smart.

48:16.907 --> 48:19.343
Imitates its prey.

48:21.144 --> 48:23.480
Can control the other monsters.

48:28.952 --> 48:31.021
No known weaknesses.

48:32.522 --> 48:34.991
And that last note simply says.

48:36.393 --> 48:38.462
Run.

48:40.564 --> 48:42.632
It could have killed me ten years ago.

48:43.333 --> 48:46.536
If this thing really is behind all this.

48:48.137 --> 48:50.206
Why wait until tonight
to finish the job?

48:51.641 --> 48:53.909
Jess, over here!

48:55.444 --> 48:57.380
It's OK.

48:57.413 --> 48:59.482
I think she just needs
a friend right now.

49:07.390 --> 49:09.458
What's a Jinn?

49:16.399 --> 49:18.467
Oooooh!

49:28.209 --> 49:30.245
Hey! You can't do that.

49:30.278 --> 49:32.347
She said I could!

49:40.722 --> 49:41.256
Wow.

49:41.289 --> 49:43.358
That's one creepy house.

49:49.564 --> 49:51.633
What now?

50:02.242 --> 50:04.311
Where did she go?

50:19.092 --> 50:21.161
Gary!

50:22.796 --> 50:24.030
Hey man!

50:31.204 --> 50:32.439
Move!

50:42.583 --> 50:44.651
Ow, what happened?

50:45.786 --> 50:48.087
And why do my balls hurt?

50:48.120 --> 50:49.155
Beth?

50:49.188 --> 50:51.357
Are you OK?

50:59.632 --> 51:01.434
Come on, where are you?

51:01.467 --> 51:03.536
Sophie,
tell me you have something!

51:04.069 --> 51:07.373
A Jinn can posses anyone but
never the same person twice!

51:09.442 --> 51:11.142
Something useful!

51:11.176 --> 51:12.777
We need to wind it!
If we can force

51:12.778 --> 51:15.046
it out, we can trap it
back in the picture!

51:16.849 --> 51:17.716
Jess, get the picture!

51:23.622 --> 51:25.190
Get ready.

51:25.223 --> 51:27.292
For what?

51:31.563 --> 51:32.731
Sorry Beth.

51:43.173 --> 51:44.476
Nice one.

51:49.280 --> 51:51.348
I'm alright.

51:51.716 --> 51:53.785
Guys.

51:56.788 --> 51:59.056
I killed him.

52:01.191 --> 52:03.260
It's not your fault Gary.

52:08.299 --> 52:10.334
I'll put him with the others.

52:10.367 --> 52:12.436
Shall I?

52:55.578 --> 52:56.946
What are you doing here?

52:56.980 --> 53:00.850
I was hiding from the monsters
and you brought one here!

53:00.883 --> 53:02.518
Shit.

53:02.552 --> 53:05.855
You're that German exchange student.
Helga, right?

53:05.888 --> 53:07.824
So you don't have a clue
what I'm saying.

53:07.857 --> 53:10.225
Well, for what it's worth.

53:10.258 --> 53:12.426
There was a huge fucking monster
attack that killed a bunch of people.

53:12.427 --> 53:14.730
Then this shape-shifting bitch
threw me out a window

53:14.763 --> 53:16.899
and now I've got this weird
axe man thing stalking me

53:16.933 --> 53:18.667
and you don't have a clue
what I'm saying!

53:18.700 --> 53:19.368
Brilliant!

53:20.936 --> 53:22.437
I understand perfectly.

53:22.471 --> 53:23.738
I was at the party and escaped.

53:23.739 --> 53:27.643
I was perfectly safe
hiding here until you turned up!

53:27.676 --> 53:29.678
Don't worry Helga.
We're going to stick together.

53:29.711 --> 53:32.279
We need to find my friends
and make sure they're OK.

53:32.314 --> 53:33.915
Well count me out!

53:33.949 --> 53:35.550
That's the spirit.

53:35.584 --> 53:36.618
I'm Mona by the way.

53:36.652 --> 53:38.352
I know!

53:38.386 --> 53:41.723
You're the girl who is
always in trouble at school!

53:42.523 --> 53:44.726
It's a handshake.

53:44.760 --> 53:46.962
Means we're partners now.

53:46.995 --> 53:49.263
Come on.

53:51.232 --> 53:53.266
What are you doing?
You can't go that way, you'll be killed!

53:53.267 --> 53:55.235
I have a car parked
just around the corner.

53:55.236 --> 53:56.469
If we head back the other way,
we can get out of here!

53:57.471 --> 53:59.940
I know you're scared but
you've got to be quiet.

53:59.974 --> 54:01.909
In a moment we'll get our chance

54:01.942 --> 54:03.277
and we'll make a run for it.

54:03.310 --> 54:04.445
What?!

54:04.478 --> 54:05.513
Now!

54:05.546 --> 54:07.948
Get off me!
My car's this way you idiot!

54:10.484 --> 54:11.419
Helga!

54:15.022 --> 54:17.658
See, there's a definite
pattern in the notes.

54:17.692 --> 54:19.392
What was Mum up to?

54:19.426 --> 54:23.563
She knew all sorts. Breeds of monsters,
their vulnerable spots, how to hunt them.

54:24.431 --> 54:28.268
I just wish she'd finished
translating the book.

54:28.301 --> 54:30.370
Me too.

54:31.504 --> 54:33.239
Near as I can tell,

54:33.273 --> 54:37.343
each of these monsters was
summoned by the blood ritual.

54:37.377 --> 54:38.978
But the rituals over now, right?

54:39.012 --> 54:41.281
I don't know.

54:41.781 --> 54:43.783
There's something missing.

54:43.817 --> 54:46.653
Also, there's something else
that's been bothering me.

54:48.287 --> 54:51.958
That thing could kick the door down
and slice us all to pieces at any minute

54:51.991 --> 54:54.259
but he hasn't.

54:54.493 --> 54:55.795
Why?

54:55.829 --> 54:58.664
And, when I was possessed by the Jinn.

54:59.331 --> 55:01.633
I couldn't control my actions but

55:01.667 --> 55:05.871
I could feel what was going on and
when I had my hands around your neck,

55:06.973 --> 55:08.841
He wasn't trying to kill you.

55:09.975 --> 55:12.611
This thing had be backed into a corner.

55:12.644 --> 55:14.747
It could have killed me
in an instant but

55:15.414 --> 55:17.750
instead, it hesitated.

55:17.783 --> 55:20.018
They're keeping you alive.

55:20.052 --> 55:22.320
For how long?

55:23.922 --> 55:25.891
We've been lucky so far.

55:25.924 --> 55:28.827
But I doubt a cake knife is going
to get us past what's outside.

55:30.763 --> 55:32.831
If Mum really knew all these things,

55:33.631 --> 55:35.700
she must have had a way
of defending herself.

55:36.068 --> 55:39.637
If I was a monster hunter I'd have
kept a shotgun above the fireplace.

55:50.782 --> 55:52.383
It's the farm.

55:52.416 --> 55:54.085
That's the house...

55:54.118 --> 55:56.387
and the barn.

55:57.121 --> 55:59.023
But what's that?

55:59.056 --> 56:00.390
Vault.

56:00.423 --> 56:02.593
What does that mean?

56:02.627 --> 56:04.929
Well whatever it is,
it must be underground.

56:04.962 --> 56:07.031
All that's out there is a field.

56:09.666 --> 56:11.903
It looks like there's a way in
through the barn.

56:11.936 --> 56:14.704
Slim chance of getting there
in one piece.

56:18.742 --> 56:20.811
There was another way.

56:23.947 --> 56:27.384
My Mum and Dad had the house
renovated when I was really little.

56:27.884 --> 56:29.953
They had the fireplace removed.

56:30.854 --> 56:32.789
Over where the radiator is now.

56:52.142 --> 56:54.410
There could be a safe way out.

57:01.650 --> 57:03.719
You just couldn't wait, could you?

57:04.119 --> 57:07.456
Not quite midnight
but I'm sure we can stretch this out.

57:08.557 --> 57:10.959
There's plenty of
your little friends to kill first.

57:11.894 --> 57:13.963
Who the hell are you?

57:14.964 --> 57:17.700
You might recognise this face!

57:32.547 --> 57:33.748
Come here beautiful!

57:33.781 --> 57:34.816
Arya!

57:34.849 --> 57:37.186
Let me see what
your insides look like!

57:52.499 --> 57:54.568
This way!

58:02.977 --> 58:03.945
Beth.

58:04.979 --> 58:06.546
Beth!

58:07.015 --> 58:07.915
We're just in here.

58:07.948 --> 58:09.016
Is Jess with you?

58:09.050 --> 58:10.218
No.

58:10.251 --> 58:11.585
Jess!

58:11.618 --> 58:12.619
Sophie!

58:12.653 --> 58:13.086
I'm coming!

58:13.120 --> 58:15.188
Don't go!

58:22.896 --> 58:23.497
Jess.

58:23.530 --> 58:24.498
Sophie.

58:24.531 --> 58:25.866
Here, come this way.

58:29.502 --> 58:30.603
Jess!

58:30.637 --> 58:32.806
Sophie!

58:32.839 --> 58:34.942
Come and get her Sophie!

58:34.975 --> 58:37.044
I'll be waiting for you!

58:37.510 --> 58:39.913
Sophie come on!
Over here!

58:53.259 --> 58:55.528
It's taken Jess.

58:56.228 --> 58:57.563
Guys?

58:57.596 --> 58:59.665
I don't want to die Sophie.

59:00.733 --> 59:02.802
You are not going to die.

59:02.835 --> 59:04.904
Guys?

59:06.038 --> 59:09.141
I wouldn't let anything happen to you.

59:09.175 --> 59:10.508
I promise.

59:12.744 --> 59:14.813
And hey.

59:15.147 --> 59:17.216
If tonight proves anything.

59:18.150 --> 59:19.617
At least you know I'm not crazy.

59:22.821 --> 59:24.889
Guys, will you look at this!

59:25.157 --> 59:26.858
Your Mum had a weapons room!

59:31.730 --> 59:33.798
What?

01:00:28.152 --> 01:00:29.819
Sophie.

01:00:29.852 --> 01:00:30.753
Mum?

01:00:30.787 --> 01:00:33.323
That's what I'm going to call her.

01:00:33.357 --> 01:00:36.025
Jonas is over the moon.

01:00:36.059 --> 01:00:40.663
He's always wanted a girl
but this changes everything.

01:00:40.696 --> 01:00:43.933
I can't go chasing monsters
into the dark anymore.

01:00:43.966 --> 01:00:47.603
Not until Sophie is old enough
to know the truth.

01:00:47.637 --> 01:00:51.674
They'll come for her.
On the eve of her eighteenth.

01:00:52.975 --> 01:00:58.747
But when that night comes
I'll be standing right beside her.

01:00:58.781 --> 01:01:02.051
The monsters
will always be a threat.

01:01:02.085 --> 01:01:05.321
And it's my responsibility
to hunt them.

01:01:05.354 --> 01:01:07.622
Soon it will be Sophie's too.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:14.696
No matter what, I'll protect
this precious life growing inside of me.

01:01:14.729 --> 01:01:17.666
You're gonna have
a lot on your shoulders kid.

01:01:17.699 --> 01:01:21.837
But I'll be with you,
every step of the way.

01:01:32.114 --> 01:01:34.182
Sophie.

01:01:47.295 --> 01:01:49.364
This is why they've been
keeping me alive.

01:01:52.467 --> 01:01:56.036
They need my blood to complete
the ritual.

01:02:00.141 --> 01:02:02.776
They just had to wait
until I turned eighteen.

01:02:03.911 --> 01:02:06.914
So what happens
if they finish the ritual?

01:02:07.481 --> 01:02:09.183
We barely survived a handful of them.

01:02:09.216 --> 01:02:12.086
There are hundreds of
monsters in that book.

01:02:13.888 --> 01:02:15.722
No.

01:02:15.755 --> 01:02:17.757
We have to run, there has to be a way.

01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:18.459
Beth.

01:02:18.492 --> 01:02:19.993
We need to get you out of here!

01:02:20.026 --> 01:02:21.228
If they can't find you!

01:02:21.262 --> 01:02:23.330
They have Jess!

01:02:23.364 --> 01:02:25.432
I won't leave her to die.

01:02:26.766 --> 01:02:29.002
I'm the only reason that thing,

01:02:29.736 --> 01:02:31.804
hasn't killed her yet.

01:02:31.838 --> 01:02:34.340
This one isn't like
the other ones Sophie.

01:02:34.374 --> 01:02:40.079
You saw the book. There's no vulnerable
spot, no secret trick to killing it!

01:02:51.924 --> 01:02:53.926
Then we do this the old fashioned way.

01:02:54.527 --> 01:02:57.263
This is my party!

01:02:58.964 --> 01:03:01.733
Lets kill some fucking monsters!

01:03:19.818 --> 01:03:21.987
Sophie.

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:23.788
Over here.

01:03:43.874 --> 01:03:45.943
Are we ready for this?

01:03:46.811 --> 01:03:48.547
We're gonna head back to the house

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:50.982
and kill anything that gets in our way.

01:03:51.015 --> 01:03:53.084
I think we should
only kill the monsters.

01:03:53.551 --> 01:03:55.353
Yes Beth.

01:03:55.386 --> 01:03:57.855
I think she only meant
the monsters Beth.

01:03:57.888 --> 01:03:59.957
That's good.

01:04:00.424 --> 01:04:02.493
Follow me.

01:04:23.079 --> 01:04:25.415
Please, you have to help me.

01:04:26.316 --> 01:04:29.352
I'm dying and
there is a monster out there!

01:04:30.587 --> 01:04:32.856
She doesn't look good.

01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:35.558
What happened to you?

01:04:36.526 --> 01:04:40.929
At last! I was at the party
when the monster attacked

01:04:40.963 --> 01:04:42.898
and hid in the barn.

01:04:42.931 --> 01:04:44.900
Mona showed up a little after.

01:04:44.933 --> 01:04:45.602
Mona?

01:04:48.571 --> 01:04:51.006
I tried to get her to follow me

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:55.177
I have a car nearby,
if only she had listened.

01:04:55.545 --> 01:04:57.813
Is she alive?

01:05:14.896 --> 01:05:16.964
Come on.

01:05:58.639 --> 01:06:00.907
crickets chirping)

01:06:22.996 --> 01:06:24.364
Sophie!

01:06:29.035 --> 01:06:31.104
Sophie!

01:07:06.705 --> 01:07:07.640
Sophie.

01:07:08.507 --> 01:07:09.874
How do I know you're the real Mona?

01:07:09.875 --> 01:07:13.144
When you were twelve, you had
the biggest crush on Katy Perry.

01:07:15.714 --> 01:07:16.948
Still do.

01:07:20.118 --> 01:07:21.554
Oh God, I thought you were dead.

01:07:25.758 --> 01:07:28.026
I'm still here.

01:07:28.493 --> 01:07:30.562
You look bad ass.

01:07:32.363 --> 01:07:34.098
And Beth.

01:07:34.132 --> 01:07:36.201
You look fierce.

01:07:36.701 --> 01:07:38.937
I'm glad you're alive Mona.

01:07:39.604 --> 01:07:40.738
Me too.

01:07:41.673 --> 01:07:43.006
So.

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.509
We're going back to the house.

01:07:44.542 --> 01:07:45.743
Get some drinks.

01:07:45.777 --> 01:07:46.611
Kill some Monsters.

01:07:47.378 --> 01:07:49.447
You coming?

01:07:49.747 --> 01:07:50.415
Hell yeah.

01:08:00.524 --> 01:08:02.159
Lets do this!

01:08:11.068 --> 01:08:12.636
Alright.

01:08:12.669 --> 01:08:14.738
You've already gone.

01:08:15.405 --> 01:08:17.274
OK!

01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:54.243
I didn't know your clock did that.

01:08:54.277 --> 01:08:56.345
It doesn't.

01:08:57.145 --> 01:08:58.247
Guys?

01:08:58.281 --> 01:09:00.349
I need a pee.

01:09:02.852 --> 01:09:05.120
Sorry.

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.421
When you've gotta go, you've gotta go.

01:09:07.857 --> 01:09:10.125
Bathroom's down there.

01:09:10.392 --> 01:09:12.460
I'll be quick.

01:09:58.706 --> 01:09:59.840
Kill me.

01:10:00.908 --> 01:10:02.343
Kill me!

01:10:03.277 --> 01:10:04.678
Kill me!

01:10:07.848 --> 01:10:08.548
Sophie!

01:10:08.549 --> 01:10:10.351
Jess!

01:10:11.485 --> 01:10:13.587
Mona! Gary needs us!

01:10:13.854 --> 01:10:14.588
Sophie.

01:10:14.622 --> 01:10:16.222
You go with Beth.

01:10:18.525 --> 01:10:20.594
I've got this.

01:10:24.798 --> 01:10:26.867
Gary!

01:10:33.373 --> 01:10:34.908
Mona! Mona, come on!

01:10:37.644 --> 01:10:38.578
No, Gary!

01:10:46.953 --> 01:10:49.555
Happy Birthday Sophie.

01:10:50.423 --> 01:10:51.724
Let her go!

01:10:55.427 --> 01:10:59.464
You've grown up
so much since we first met.

01:10:59.966 --> 01:11:03.803
And like the fatted calf,
you're ready to be slaughtered.

01:11:05.004 --> 01:11:08.507
With your blood,
I will summon all of my kin!

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:11.343
And then the ritual
will finally be complete!

01:11:14.413 --> 01:11:17.349
Will you scream for me Sophie?

01:11:17.382 --> 01:11:19.651
Just like Mummy did?

01:12:05.563 --> 01:12:07.665
Die you monster scum!

01:12:24.048 --> 01:12:26.483
Come on Gary. Come on Gary!

01:12:27.851 --> 01:12:29.919
Gary.

01:12:30.487 --> 01:12:32.555
Do not die!

01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:42.499
Sophie.

01:12:43.533 --> 01:12:45.602
Sophie.

01:12:48.604 --> 01:12:50.673
It's Mum.

01:12:53.609 --> 01:12:55.310
Sophie.

01:12:55.344 --> 01:12:57.412
Mum?

01:12:58.347 --> 01:13:00.415
What are you doing darling?

01:13:01.985 --> 01:13:04.686
I'm so disappointed in you.

01:13:05.654 --> 01:13:07.723
Put that thing down!

01:13:08.023 --> 01:13:10.292
You should be ashamed of yourself!

01:13:10.726 --> 01:13:12.027
Nice try Bitch!

01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:33.714
Jess!

01:13:47.495 --> 01:13:49.564
Get a room!

01:13:50.765 --> 01:13:52.967
Or at least clean this one up!

01:14:08.748 --> 01:14:09.951
Beth.

01:14:09.984 --> 01:14:11.785
Sophie!

01:14:11.818 --> 01:14:13.887
Jess!

01:14:18.125 --> 01:14:20.393
Is Gary OK?

01:14:41.614 --> 01:14:43.682
I thought I was a Gonner.

01:14:44.885 --> 01:14:46.953
But Beth saved me.

01:15:02.735 --> 01:15:04.803
Are we safe?

01:15:05.604 --> 01:15:07.673
For now.

01:15:09.208 --> 01:15:11.476
What about this?

01:15:15.513 --> 01:15:17.582
I'm gonna study it.

01:15:17.816 --> 01:15:19.952
Use it.

01:15:19.985 --> 01:15:22.054
Find all the monsters and kill them all.

01:15:23.521 --> 01:15:25.590
And we'll help you.

01:15:27.792 --> 01:15:30.028
Can we go to the Hospital first please?

01:15:48.746 --> 01:15:50.815
Hi.

01:15:51.282 --> 01:15:53.684
What the fuck?

01:15:54.852 --> 01:15:56.921
Hello.

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:41.856
Let's do this!
