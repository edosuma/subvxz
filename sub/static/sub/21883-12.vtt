WEBVTT

01:05.774 --> 01:07.150
I am glad you are back.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.570
It's taking us too long
to get rid of those three.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.449
I have a plan to end this
once and for all.

01:14.991 --> 01:17.744
For both of our sakes, I hope it works.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.998
The DEA is putting
more pressure on me each time.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.208
It will work for sure,

01:25.210 --> 01:26.836
and the DEA is going to help us.

01:27.587 --> 01:28.588
Talk to them.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.757
Tell them we need a new ally.

01:33.384 --> 01:36.846
COLORADO PRISON
UNITED STATES

01:52.862 --> 01:56.533
Raziel, this is Manny, a DEA agent.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.003
Things are getting out of control
in Mexico.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.589
We need your help

02:12.257 --> 02:15.218
to ensure this war's result
is good for us.

02:16.469 --> 02:17.637
If you do it,

02:19.347 --> 02:20.557
we'll look for a way to reward you.

02:24.727 --> 02:28.022
TONY TORMENTA'S RESIDENCE

02:28.106 --> 02:30.275
Sir, it's your brother.

02:35.822 --> 02:36.739
Raziel.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.451
Tony, the DEA offered me a deal,
and I can't say no to it.

02:40.910 --> 02:42.537
If we help them,
my jail time will be reduced.

02:42.787 --> 02:43.705
<i>What do we need to do?</i>

02:44.122 --> 02:45.874
Work with Chapo and kill Cano.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.543
So that motherfucker wins the war?
No way.

02:49.377 --> 02:50.378
That bastard gave you away,

02:50.628 --> 02:53.256
and because of him we lost
control over Nuevo Laredo.

02:53.339 --> 02:54.340
It's that or I die in this jail.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.801
If we team up with Chapo,

02:57.051 --> 02:58.469
you are not only helping me, Tony,

02:58.761 --> 03:00.096
<i>we also get rid of Cano.</i>

03:13.985 --> 03:17.947
<i>I feel the warmth</i>
<i>from my boiling blood</i>

03:18.531 --> 03:22.660
<i>I feel the fear, sweat dripping away</i>

03:22.785 --> 03:26.748
<i>There's a stillness</i>
<i>that nothing transmits</i>

03:27.415 --> 03:33.588
<i>I'm a breeze that grows stronger</i>

03:33.796 --> 03:36.925
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

03:38.051 --> 03:41.679
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

03:42.430 --> 03:45.975
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

03:46.976 --> 03:51.105
<i>To unleash my return</i>

03:55.652 --> 03:59.572
<i>I have the dust that protects the road</i>

03:59.822 --> 04:03.952
<i>I have the branches of a leafless tree</i>

04:04.661 --> 04:08.623
<i>I'm the guardian of the tired night</i>

04:08.831 --> 04:14.879
<i>There are silhouettes that</i>
<i>come to meet me</i>

04:15.505 --> 04:19.759
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

04:19.842 --> 04:22.804
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

04:23.846 --> 04:27.517
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

04:28.643 --> 04:32.522
<i>To unleash my return</i>

04:56.754 --> 04:58.589
<i>The Tony Tormenta plan</i>
<i>is already in action.</i>

05:00.258 --> 05:01.676
It's the best option for both of us.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.095
I doubt he'll refuse.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.893
Now we have to weaken
Chente's allies at Juárez.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.062
We can put pressure on them
with a public incident.

05:13.688 --> 05:14.856
Make it happen.

05:16.941 --> 05:19.527
REHAB CENTER
CITY OF JUÁREZ, MEXICO

05:34.000 --> 05:35.668
-Good morning, sir.
-How can we help you?

05:36.836 --> 05:38.629
-I'm here to visit my brother.
-What's his name?

05:39.130 --> 05:40.089
Raúl Pérez.

05:59.525 --> 06:00.568
Please, don't shoot.

06:11.329 --> 06:14.499
<i>-How are things with Arturo?</i>
-Kill them all.

06:14.582 --> 06:16.125
I swear I know nothing.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.002
<i>He hasn't gone to any safe house.</i>

06:19.670 --> 06:21.631
Do you know where your boss is?

06:21.756 --> 06:24.217
The Army is waiting for him,
in case he returns.

06:25.134 --> 06:27.887
ARTURO BERNAL'S WAREHOUSE

06:33.476 --> 06:34.894
<i>They're also going</i>
<i>to hit the packaging plants.</i>

06:39.190 --> 06:40.316
That will be a hard blow for him.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.112
Careful! The door!

06:50.952 --> 06:51.828
To the floor!

06:51.911 --> 06:52.829
Don't move!

07:11.431 --> 07:12.473
Where is Arturo?

07:12.807 --> 07:13.724
I don't know.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.978
I was just ordered to...

07:17.186 --> 07:18.980
Stop playing the fool!

07:19.063 --> 07:21.482
Or you won't get out of here alive.
Where is he?

07:21.566 --> 07:24.193
We have to act now. They are
attacking us from everywhere.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.196
<i>Hide for a while,</i>
<i>plan things thoroughly.</i>

07:27.989 --> 07:29.907
If Chapo came back after
what happened with his son,

07:30.992 --> 07:32.410
he won't hold back.

07:32.827 --> 07:33.870
I don't give a shit.

07:34.370 --> 07:35.955
Let's see who kills whom first.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.375
Come on, let's go!

07:43.337 --> 07:47.550
MORALES
MAYOR OF THE CITY OF JUÁREZ

08:08.488 --> 08:09.322
How many?

08:09.864 --> 08:13.242
Nineteen teenagers and two attendants.

08:14.785 --> 08:17.455
Bastard! Murderer!

08:23.961 --> 08:25.796
Good evening, Mr. Mayor,
what do we know of this event?

08:26.088 --> 08:27.381
- Murderer!
-We will find those responsible.

08:27.715 --> 08:30.092
-It's your fault!
-Was this a cartel attack?

08:30.176 --> 08:31.719
People say you are working for Chente.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.597
Murderer! Murderer!

08:35.473 --> 08:36.599
Is that true?

08:36.974 --> 08:38.434
Murderer!

08:38.643 --> 08:41.979
I pay you to manage
the media, idiot.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.940
You have to clear my name.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.902
I don't want them to suspect
I work for Chente.

08:51.656 --> 08:52.657
Talk to you later.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.493
Why are you going this way?

08:57.286 --> 08:58.246
Gutierrez.

08:58.871 --> 08:59.830
Gutierrez!

09:02.833 --> 09:04.085
You'll have to come with me.

09:07.296 --> 09:09.048
How many of your men
are watching the area?

09:09.298 --> 09:11.968
I don't want the cartel of Sinaloa
in Juarez ever again.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.469
COMMANDER FLORES
CITY OF JUAREZ CHIEF OF MUNICIPAL POLICE

09:13.553 --> 09:15.221
You can count on all my men.

09:15.304 --> 09:18.182
But we have lost a lot of men,
yours and mine.

09:18.432 --> 09:20.810
-We need more people.
-We can recruit them somewhere else.

09:21.018 --> 09:23.563
I have contact
with the Pura Raza gang in L.A.

09:23.980 --> 09:24.814
Get them.

09:58.180 --> 09:59.599
That's all the money.

10:37.011 --> 10:39.096
If you think Juarez is fucked up now
because of this war,

10:40.014 --> 10:41.307
you have no idea what's coming, Morales.

10:43.559 --> 10:44.477
What do you want?

10:45.061 --> 10:46.479
Stop working with Chente.

10:47.021 --> 10:47.980
Work for me instead.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.650
The killing in the rehab center

10:50.775 --> 10:52.526
is nothing compared to what
we will do if you refuse.

10:53.736 --> 10:54.987
We'll strike you so hard,

10:55.946 --> 10:58.324
that your political career
will be over forever, asshole.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.205
Both the local and federal government

11:04.288 --> 11:05.373
CITY HALL

11:05.456 --> 11:09.835
will work together to implement
a security plan to fight back

11:09.919 --> 11:11.253
against all the violence in Morelos.

11:12.380 --> 11:15.591
We'll stop the organized crime
that has invaded this state...

11:16.717 --> 11:19.845
<i>so the inhabitants can live</i>
<i>peacefully again.</i>

11:19.970 --> 11:22.723
<i>We still know nothing of</i>
<i>Arturo Bernal's whereabouts, sir.</i>

11:22.807 --> 11:23.682
<i>I'll keep you informed.</i>

11:23.808 --> 11:27.686
<i>We want to keep your sons</i>
<i>and daughters away from drugs.</i>

11:28.729 --> 11:32.274
We want every single family
to have a better life.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.009
CITY HALL
CITY OF JUÁREZ

12:02.430 --> 12:04.265
-Commander Flores.
-Sir.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.602
I want you to meet Colonel Mata,

12:10.146 --> 12:11.730
the city's new Chief of Police.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.069
Please, Commander, give me your weapon.

12:18.779 --> 12:20.573
You are under arrest for
illegal association.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.457
Mr. Secretary, what can you
tell us about El Chapo's whereabouts?

12:29.707 --> 12:31.333
We are closer and closer to him.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.085
We'll capture him soon.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.224
<i>And what do you have to say</i>
<i>about the rumors</i>

12:47.308 --> 12:49.977
that say you are collaborating
with the Sinaloa Cartel?

12:51.479 --> 12:52.813
That's defamation.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.539
Don't make me get you out of the car.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.219
Not you.

13:24.428 --> 13:25.429
You stay right there.

13:43.697 --> 13:44.865
Looking for me?

13:46.450 --> 13:47.576
Here I am, Conrado.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.414
You owe me, because of my brother.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.501
But this is your lucky day.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.088
You'll help me to forget you arrested him.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.842
You will stop helping El Chapo.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.639
All right.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.476
But I don't work alone.

14:15.437 --> 14:16.814
I need to inform the President.

14:28.868 --> 14:29.785
Do you believe him?

14:34.623 --> 14:36.083
Because I don't, Conrado.

14:37.793 --> 14:38.919
I don't trust politicians.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.005
So say your prayers.

14:41.088 --> 14:41.922
Arturo...

14:43.007 --> 14:44.258
Let him inform the President.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.094
We don't want to mess
with the federal power.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.358
Interrupt me again, and you are dead.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.579
I'll give you a chance.

15:14.622 --> 15:15.998
But if you keep helping him,

15:16.081 --> 15:17.249
I'll find you, and kill you.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.502
Tell that to the fucking President.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.254
Are we clear?

16:04.797 --> 16:05.631
Hello?

16:10.511 --> 16:11.553
It's Mr. Sol, sir.

16:12.888 --> 16:13.764
Yes?

16:13.973 --> 16:14.890
I almost got killed.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.850
That motherfucker wanted to kill me.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.186
What? Who?

16:19.603 --> 16:20.437
Arturo Bernal, Joaquín.

16:21.605 --> 16:23.273
If it wasn't for Muñeca,
I'd be dead right now.

16:24.858 --> 16:26.735
Muñeca stopped him from killing you?

16:27.277 --> 16:28.237
<i>He's out of control.</i>

16:28.904 --> 16:29.822
He threatened the President.

16:30.948 --> 16:31.949
<i>He even threatened Muñeca.</i>

16:40.708 --> 16:42.209
Commander Flores was arrested.

16:42.876 --> 16:44.670
The new one wants us to work for Chapo.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.756
Did Flores manage to recruit
the L.A. gang?

16:48.424 --> 16:49.508
No, sir.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.220
Thanks for your loyalty, guys.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.181
Keep informing me, and I'll know
how to reward you.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.276
One last question.

17:08.610 --> 17:09.570
Besides you,

17:10.029 --> 17:11.405
does anyone else know about this house?

17:12.072 --> 17:14.700
No, he can be reassured.

17:15.784 --> 17:16.660
Good.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.120
Thanks.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.217
It's better like this.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.970
They would have sold us
to El Chapo, eventually.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.722
-Maybe we should negotiate--
-Never.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.142
We'll make it through on our own.

17:45.522 --> 17:48.025
MEXICO CITY

18:29.274 --> 18:31.735
I came as fast as I could.
Are you all right?

18:43.997 --> 18:45.082
I almost got killed.

18:50.754 --> 18:52.005
Maybe you should bail out.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.217
You have enough money to have a good life.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.264
It's not about the money.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.185
I've worked hard to get what I want.

19:10.566 --> 19:11.733
So you'll keep doing it.

19:19.908 --> 19:20.868
Until the very end.

19:24.329 --> 19:26.582
Then I'll have to call you
Mr. President someday.

19:32.421 --> 19:33.922
Things are about to change, people.

19:36.425 --> 19:37.634
From now on,

19:38.927 --> 19:41.221
we won't cooperate with
the Juárez Cartel anymore.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.933
The person who dares to disobey...

19:46.685 --> 19:48.020
will surely regret it.

19:50.314 --> 19:53.400
ARTURO BERNAL'S SAFE HOUSE

19:58.113 --> 20:01.450
Your boss is an asshole.
He messed with the government.

20:08.290 --> 20:11.376
They are very, very unhappy.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.130
I don't know where he is,

20:18.592 --> 20:20.010
but I know where you can find Muñeca.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.020
Conrado.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.022
<i>We know where Muñeca is.</i>

20:32.105 --> 20:34.358
<i>The Army is trying to set him up.</i>

20:35.067 --> 20:36.068
Tell them not to kill him.

20:40.197 --> 20:41.031
MORELOS
MEXICO

20:41.114 --> 20:42.282
The Army found us!

21:03.053 --> 21:03.887
Stop!

21:05.430 --> 21:06.390
Stay still, motherfucker!

21:07.891 --> 21:09.017
Stay still.

21:25.492 --> 21:26.368
Take him away.

21:31.498 --> 21:32.541
<i>They're arriving.</i>

21:42.301 --> 21:45.304
TONY TORMENTA'S RESIDENCE

21:47.431 --> 21:48.724
<i>I know everything about the Emes.</i>

21:49.850 --> 21:52.561
<i>The location of their safe houses,</i>
<i>their secret passwords...</i>

21:53.478 --> 21:55.147
I even know how often
they talk to each other.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.649
But I won't talk for free.

22:02.654 --> 22:03.655
What do you want?

22:04.114 --> 22:06.158
Besides my brother's portion,

22:06.950 --> 22:08.452
I want us to divide Nuevo Laredo.

22:09.953 --> 22:12.581
Three quarters for me,
and one quarter for you.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.044
We agree...

22:18.420 --> 22:19.421
but the other way around.

22:20.505 --> 22:22.591
Three quarters for us, and one for you.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.973
Without this information,
you can't take that territory.

22:33.143 --> 22:35.812
And without us,
that information is useless.

22:36.605 --> 22:39.608
If you are out, Raziel will rot in prison.

22:47.616 --> 22:48.784
Let's go half and half.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.119
Two quarters each.

23:12.933 --> 23:13.850
Untie him.

23:19.189 --> 23:20.232
Your favorite.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.151
I won't give Arturo away.

23:24.736 --> 23:25.862
Think it over.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.990
You are alive because I can use you,
that's all.

23:29.407 --> 23:31.034
How can I be sure
you won't kill me afterwards?

23:32.410 --> 23:33.912
You are not a man of your word, Joaquin.

23:35.872 --> 23:37.999
You call it treason, I call it survival.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.545
Arturo is out of control,
and you can't tolerate that.

23:42.838 --> 23:46.133
Being faithful to him is useless, Muñeca.

23:46.716 --> 23:48.218
His addiction to coke is making him crazy.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.471
Sooner or later, his paranoia...

23:52.305 --> 23:53.723
will be greater than your loyalty.

23:55.559 --> 23:56.852
He will end up killing you.

23:59.896 --> 24:00.856
It's your choice:

24:03.358 --> 24:04.359
Dying faithful...

24:05.902 --> 24:09.072
or spilling the beans
and keeping his territory.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.084
Including Acapulco?

24:27.757 --> 24:29.926
See? That's what I call survival.

24:33.889 --> 24:35.098
We are ready to attack.

24:35.473 --> 24:37.434
PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE
MEXICO CITY

24:37.517 --> 24:40.854
But we'll need more help than
just the Federales and the Army.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.022
You want the Navy as well?

24:44.024 --> 24:45.233
Only you can authorize it.

24:55.702 --> 24:57.579
Are you sure it will work out this time?

24:57.913 --> 24:59.206
It's the only choice left.

25:19.851 --> 25:22.938
MORENO'S MEMORIAL
NEIGHBORHOOD OF ALAMEDA, CULIACÁN

25:23.021 --> 25:25.315
In your name and your uncle's,
I'll finish what I started.

25:25.732 --> 25:26.733
I swear.

25:36.993 --> 25:38.078
Are you ready for war?

26:26.084 --> 26:29.296
<i>The Sinaloa Cartel and the Army</i>
<i>are in town.</i>

26:33.049 --> 26:36.386
Boss, the Sinaloa Cartel
and the Army are here.

26:37.178 --> 26:38.471
Tony Tormenta is with them.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.308
I'll get rid of that traitor. Let's go.

26:47.063 --> 26:48.315
They are coming from the north.

26:54.779 --> 26:56.072
Come on! Get moving!

27:05.165 --> 27:06.458
Come on, you bastards!

27:11.713 --> 27:13.631
NUEVO LAREDO NORTHERN HIGHWAY

27:38.698 --> 27:41.618
CITY OF JUÁREZ

27:42.202 --> 27:44.371
Listen, we'll come in through the left.

27:44.996 --> 27:48.083
<i>They are five blocks to the right.</i>

27:49.918 --> 27:50.752
Copy that.

28:08.812 --> 28:09.854
Three.

28:16.903 --> 28:20.657
NORTHERN SAFE HOUSE
CITY OF JUÁREZ

28:48.852 --> 28:50.520
SOUTHERN SAFE HOUSE
CITY OF JUAREZ

29:06.202 --> 29:07.203
<i>They are in.</i>

29:08.204 --> 29:09.956
They are attacking the hitmen's homes.

29:10.582 --> 29:11.624
We have to leave now.

29:12.459 --> 29:13.376
No.

29:15.462 --> 29:16.296
Gentlemen...

29:18.089 --> 29:19.382
it's time to prove what we are made of.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.634
Let's protect our land until the very end.

29:25.221 --> 29:27.807
ARTURO BERNAL LEYDA RESIDENCE

29:30.977 --> 29:33.855
Why the fuck didn't I kill that
fucking politician?

29:36.065 --> 29:37.108
This is your fucking fault.

29:40.111 --> 29:41.863
I'll have to kill them all.

30:01.216 --> 30:03.009
Come on Trujillo, shoot over there.

30:27.450 --> 30:29.118
They are everywhere!

30:36.501 --> 30:37.544
Turn around!

30:43.299 --> 30:44.592
We must not let them surround us!

30:45.802 --> 30:46.845
Intercept their communications.

31:01.943 --> 31:02.819
Respond.

31:03.236 --> 31:04.612
Tony Tormenta's here, sir.

31:08.283 --> 31:09.534
Fuck you all, motherfuckers!

31:11.744 --> 31:12.829
Give me your position.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.379
<i>Wait there.</i>

31:21.462 --> 31:22.463
Let's go.

31:26.342 --> 31:27.218
To the glen!

31:46.237 --> 31:47.572
<i>We intercepted them.</i>

31:47.655 --> 31:48.823
Cano is coming this way.

31:50.867 --> 31:51.784
Copy that.

32:08.885 --> 32:10.345
I don't give a shit about your excuses.

32:11.137 --> 32:13.181
Find out where their new safe houses are.

32:16.517 --> 32:17.560
Why is it closed?

32:18.061 --> 32:19.103
It was my order.

32:20.438 --> 32:21.773
If you want to live,

32:22.857 --> 32:24.484
find out where El Chapo is.

32:28.237 --> 32:29.238
I have to go out.

32:31.741 --> 32:32.659
Why?

32:33.034 --> 32:33.952
I need to see my girl.

32:34.285 --> 32:35.328
I need to fuck.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.038
You can't.

32:39.916 --> 32:42.710
As soon as I get info on getting El Chapo,
we'll leave to Culiacán.

32:55.181 --> 32:56.432
<i>Do we proceed, Admiral?</i>

33:00.561 --> 33:02.563
Let's wait a bit more for
Muñeca to come out.

33:03.147 --> 33:04.315
If he doesn't, let's go in.

33:05.358 --> 33:06.693
CITY OF JUÁREZ

33:10.822 --> 33:12.448
They blocked all the ways out.

33:12.907 --> 33:14.117
They are everywhere!

33:14.450 --> 33:16.828
Hang in there. No one will take
Juárez away from us.

34:17.638 --> 34:18.514
Arturo,

34:20.641 --> 34:21.934
how will we strike El Chapo?

34:22.393 --> 34:25.229
He must be more protected than ever,
and we are fugitives.

34:25.396 --> 34:26.272
Before anything,

34:27.398 --> 34:28.900
we have to find where he is hiding.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.735
We'll decide how to kill him later.

34:31.277 --> 34:32.320
We'll need a whole army for that.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.323
Give me a couple of days.
I'll have people and weapons ready.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.744
We can't go to Culiacán
with only eight men.

34:40.953 --> 34:42.455
But I can't do much if I can't go out.

34:49.587 --> 34:50.588
What is it?

34:51.756 --> 34:52.673
You don't trust me?

35:06.979 --> 35:09.232
Let me know when everything
is ready, all right?

35:42.056 --> 35:42.890
Get in.

36:28.394 --> 36:29.270
For being a traitor.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.105
Tony Tormenta is down!

37:19.028 --> 37:19.862
Prieto!

37:28.079 --> 37:29.080
Dámaso!

37:29.664 --> 37:30.665
The radio!

37:38.464 --> 37:40.091
Hey! We need help!

37:40.508 --> 37:41.968
Hang on, we are waiting
for reinforcements!

38:31.058 --> 38:32.184
Come on!

38:45.114 --> 38:46.240
<i>Where are you?</i>

38:46.866 --> 38:49.160
<i>JR, what's going on?</i>

38:52.538 --> 38:53.956
Answer me, you idiot!

39:11.515 --> 39:12.558
Assholes.

39:14.643 --> 39:15.978
Go away.

39:16.812 --> 39:17.897
I don't need you.

40:24.213 --> 40:25.506
You're fucked, assholes!

40:28.676 --> 40:30.302
The Navy is here!

41:45.336 --> 41:46.420
Cano here, go ahead.

41:46.712 --> 41:48.672
<i>The Navy just got here, sir.</i>

41:48.964 --> 41:50.216
<i>M16 is down.</i>

41:52.801 --> 41:54.053
Fuck!

42:57.533 --> 42:58.867
Come on!

42:59.994 --> 43:00.911
Get down!

43:37.197 --> 43:38.532
Boss.

43:47.041 --> 43:48.542
I'll take you out of Nuevo Laredo.

43:49.543 --> 43:50.419
It's for the best.

44:13.108 --> 44:14.652
Get out of the car with your hands up.

44:19.657 --> 44:20.741
<i>Get out or we'll shoot.</i>

44:32.378 --> 44:33.295
Let's go.

44:36.340 --> 44:37.216
Cuff him.

45:01.573 --> 45:03.409
FORENSIC MEDICAL INSTITUTE

45:23.637 --> 45:24.805
It's the only way, boss.

45:25.722 --> 45:27.057
We can trust the driver.

46:21.487 --> 46:22.404
Arturo is dead.

46:24.990 --> 46:26.492
Cano ran away from Nuevo Laredo.

46:27.409 --> 46:28.619
Juárez is ours.

46:31.371 --> 46:33.332
I didn't inherit the power, Chente.

46:34.416 --> 46:35.417
I earned it myself.

46:36.793 --> 46:38.128
And after all this time,

46:40.047 --> 46:41.048
I got what I wanted.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.220
But the price you paid was your son.

46:49.765 --> 46:50.974
You can say whatever you want,

46:51.808 --> 46:53.268
but you are the one keeling before me.

46:58.524 --> 46:59.775
I'd rather die...

47:01.652 --> 47:03.612
before acknowledging you
as my boss, Chapo.

47:07.074 --> 47:08.033
Don't worry.

47:09.117 --> 47:10.202
I don't need you to do that.

47:10.911 --> 47:12.538
I couldn't care less if you are
dead or alive.

47:13.580 --> 47:15.165
But the government wants you as a trophy.

47:18.168 --> 47:20.170
Enjoy your time in jail.

47:35.519 --> 47:38.230
We have captured Vicente Castillo,

47:39.189 --> 47:40.774
better known as Chente,

47:41.692 --> 47:43.151
leader of the Juárez Cartel.

47:44.111 --> 47:47.072
This proves we are committed
to fighting back the crime,

47:47.823 --> 47:52.160
<i>and restoring peace</i>
<i>in the Mexican citizens' lives.</i>

47:53.161 --> 47:54.246
<i>You may ask questions.</i>

48:03.130 --> 48:04.548
<i>Conrado.</i>

48:04.631 --> 48:05.757
We made it.

48:06.967 --> 48:08.844
You have all the power now,

48:09.886 --> 48:11.597
and I am one step closer
to becoming president.

48:14.057 --> 48:15.892
I told you this was a win-win situation.

48:17.102 --> 48:18.437
Talk to you later, Conrado.

48:33.869 --> 48:35.412
In honor of my buddy!

48:36.538 --> 48:39.166
Because he wasn't lying
when he said that Sinaloa

48:39.791 --> 48:42.210
was going to become
Mexico's most powerful organization.

48:43.211 --> 48:45.213
And the world's too, very soon. Cheers!

48:45.380 --> 48:46.840
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

48:52.095 --> 48:53.930
Celebrate with me.

48:55.098 --> 48:56.725
This victory also belongs to you.

48:57.851 --> 48:59.102
Thank you, sir.

49:01.688 --> 49:03.398
I haven't finished.

49:04.399 --> 49:05.692
You are going to Guadalajara.

49:06.777 --> 49:07.986
Now you are the boss.

49:08.779 --> 49:09.780
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

49:11.573 --> 49:12.616
Congratulations, Toño!

49:13.033 --> 49:15.160
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

49:33.804 --> 49:34.680
Hello?

49:38.100 --> 49:39.017
Yeah.

49:47.567 --> 49:48.485
Thank you.

49:56.993 --> 49:58.120
I'll be there right away.

50:17.472 --> 50:18.432
Where are you going?

50:19.850 --> 50:21.977
I have something to do.
I'll be right back.

50:26.022 --> 50:26.940
Wait for me.

50:33.989 --> 50:34.906
I mean it.

50:36.158 --> 50:37.200
I don't want you to leave.

50:41.329 --> 50:42.497
Is this still business?

50:46.084 --> 50:47.252
Not anymore.

51:03.685 --> 51:05.353
Congratulations, Conrado.

51:06.313 --> 51:08.148
I've been watching you for a while.

51:08.231 --> 51:09.775
You have accomplished a lot.

51:09.983 --> 51:10.984
Thank you, sir.

51:18.366 --> 51:22.329
I assume you already know we have
a candidate for the coming elections.

51:24.164 --> 51:25.165
But you also know...

51:25.874 --> 51:27.167
that I like to envision the future.

51:28.919 --> 51:29.920
And I think that future...

51:31.254 --> 51:32.255
is you.

51:34.174 --> 51:36.551
We need to create your image
for presidency.

51:37.677 --> 51:39.054
If you accept, of course.

51:41.848 --> 51:42.808
It'll be my honor.

51:43.433 --> 51:44.392
Perfect.

51:45.143 --> 51:48.271
My plan is that you first become
Government Secretary

51:48.814 --> 51:50.106
for the next six-year period.

51:50.732 --> 51:52.484
I can assure you our candidate will win.

51:54.820 --> 51:57.113
But I'd like to show you something.

52:21.680 --> 52:23.223
If you want to be president,

52:24.140 --> 52:25.517
you have to end this.

52:28.812 --> 52:30.021
Otherwise, there's no deal.

52:48.957 --> 52:50.125
I fulfilled my promise, son.

52:50.792 --> 52:52.961
You, your uncle, and I made it.

53:02.762 --> 53:05.348
<i>I am Mexico's</i>
<i>most powerful man.</i>

53:05.432 --> 53:07.851
<i>And now, I'll become</i>
<i>the most powerful man in the world.</i>
