WEBVTT

00:02.560 --> 00:05.028
Well, this is gonna be
a sucky weekend.

00:05.240 --> 00:09.392
Try spending it with an 11 -year-old
who does nothing but complain.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.672
You mean me?

00:11.840 --> 00:14.912
Boy, no wonder they got to
write your name in your underwear.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.355
What am I supposed to do?

00:18.520 --> 00:20.636
- Watch TV.
- There's nothing on.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.916
- Play a video game.
- I've played them all.

00:23.080 --> 00:24.957
- Read a book.
- Yeah, right.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.792
Who's the moron now?

00:28.200 --> 00:31.431
Okay. Here's a rainy day activity.

00:31.600 --> 00:34.672
There are 12 college basketball games on
this weekend.

00:34.840 --> 00:36.876
Dial this number, and ask for Coop.

00:37.080 --> 00:40.914
Tell him you're calling for Mr. Bojingles
and write down everything he tells you.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.872
Do I get to make
some picks this time?

00:43.080 --> 00:46.038
- You got money?
- Lf you pay me what you owe me.

00:46.240 --> 00:49.198
Well, you're getting an education here.
That's priceless.

00:50.720 --> 00:53.837
- What's going on?
- Just talking about picking colleges.

00:54.040 --> 00:56.395
- I like Duke.
- Over Wake Forest?

00:56.600 --> 00:58.238
Got a hunch.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.837
You've got him thinking about college?

01:01.040 --> 01:04.555
You're welcome.
So how'd it go at the doctor?

01:05.440 --> 01:07.351
Sit down,
I have to tell you something.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.033
What?

01:11.640 --> 01:13.471
The doctor wants me
to have a procedure.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.036
- What kind of procedure?
- He says I'm fine...

01:16.200 --> 01:19.272
...and it's routine,
but I'm really freaked out about it.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.993
What procedure?

01:21.600 --> 01:23.033
A colonoscopy.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.834
Oh, jeez, Alan, that's no big deal.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.673
They're just gonna shove
a camera up your ass.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.278
Okay, in all future references
to this procedure...

01:33.440 --> 01:38.116
...can we please use
the word "glide" or "slide"...

01:38.280 --> 01:40.510
...as opposed to "shove."

01:40.720 --> 01:43.518
Don't sweat it. Every guy eventually
has to get one of those.

01:43.680 --> 01:46.274
- It's strictly a fact-finding mission.
- You've had one?

01:46.480 --> 01:47.799
No, you crazy?

01:47.960 --> 01:51.157
But I hear there's nothing
to worry about. It's a tiny little camera.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.959
In the old days, they'd send
a sketch artist up there.

01:55.960 --> 01:57.678
Besides, you're unconscious.

01:57.880 --> 02:01.555
That's what I'm worried about.
I'll be in a very vulnerable position.

02:01.720 --> 02:05.076
- They could do anything.
- Alan, it's not a pirate ship.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.755
Just relax.
It'll be over before you know it.

02:08.919 --> 02:11.912
Yeah. I'll bet that's what they say
on pirate ships.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.599
- Damn it.
- What?

02:44.760 --> 02:46.273
The sink's stopped up again.

02:46.440 --> 02:49.671
That kid doesn't know the difference
between the garbage and the drain.

02:50.320 --> 02:53.039
- What do you want? He's 11.
- That's no excuse.

02:53.200 --> 02:56.795
If he can't tell which hole is which
at his age, he's headed for trouble.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.432
How about that?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.355
Oh, God, I had the worst nightmares.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.112
Pirate ships?

03:24.280 --> 03:26.032
Full-service gas stations.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.438
I fail to see the connection.

03:28.920 --> 03:32.390
Cold steel nozzles
going into openings.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.910
Dipsticks being pulled out.

03:37.480 --> 03:39.038
Do I have to draw you a picture?

03:39.560 --> 03:40.834
You know what?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.195
You need to get your mind off
this colonoscopy.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.631
Come on! Get in there, you sucker!

03:53.640 --> 03:55.835
Easy for you to say.

03:56.480 --> 03:57.754
How about this?

03:57.920 --> 04:00.912
How about we hop in the car
and go to Vegas for a couple of days?

04:01.400 --> 04:02.879
Just like that? What about Jake?

04:03.080 --> 04:05.230
Oh, yeah, Jake.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.597
Okay, how about this, we get him
a fake mustache and a hat...

04:08.760 --> 04:11.149
...and tell everybody his mother
was a heavy smoker.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.196
- I don't think so.
- We can still bring him...

04:14.360 --> 04:17.079
...come on, it's the perfect solution.
The kid's bored...

04:17.240 --> 04:19.913
...and you're all puckered up
over this colonoscopy thing.

04:20.120 --> 04:24.272
It just won't go in.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.113
- Well, it is a three-day weekend.
- Exactly.

04:30.280 --> 04:33.989
And I got 2 grand in my pocket that's
itching to turn into $ 12 and a hangover.

04:34.880 --> 04:37.269
Come on, we can be there
in like four hours.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.749
Unless you drive,
in which case I'm not going.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.518
Perfect, now I can't get it out.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.676
You know what? Why not?
One way or another...

04:46.840 --> 04:49.673
...I'm gonna get reamed.
I might as well enjoy a free buffet.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.633
Great. Go grab a toothbrush
and we'll hit the road.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.551
Pinky? Berta.

05:01.720 --> 05:05.759
Order a keg and call the gang,
I got the house until Tuesday.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.753
Okay, we're gonna need two rooms.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.751
One for Alan Harper and son...

05:09.920 --> 05:13.833
...and one for Charlie Harper and
a cocktail waitress to be named later.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.112
No, I don't want connecting rooms.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.271
Weren't you listening?

05:19.480 --> 05:22.153
In fact, put mine on a different floor.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.237
Come on, let's go.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.874
Now, what's playing
in your showroom?

05:27.040 --> 05:29.873
<i>Nude Legends on Ice.</i> Sweet.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.071
Okay, this may
sound like a dumb question...

05:32.240 --> 05:34.231
...but is it a family show?

05:36.200 --> 05:39.272
Well, what if the kid had a mustache?

05:40.520 --> 05:44.195
All right. He'll just have to stay in
the room and watch scrambled porn.

05:46.800 --> 05:49.951
- You could help me, you know.
- No, you're doing okay.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.518
- Where's your clean underwear?
- I'm wearing it.

05:55.160 --> 05:58.197
- That's all you brought for the weekend?
- It's only three days.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.677
All right, we'll pick some up there.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.155
They'd last five days
if I turn them inside out.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.112
What's going on? Aren't you ready?

06:09.280 --> 06:11.714
- I'm packing Jake.
- For what, college?

06:13.080 --> 06:15.275
- What the hell's this?
- So he can go swimming.

06:15.480 --> 06:18.836
- Where?
- They have pools in Vegas, Charlie.

06:19.720 --> 06:23.190
Why don't you bring a frying pan,
they got kitchens too.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.631
- Let's see. Sport jacket.
- He doesn't need a sport jacket.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.677
What if we take him someplace nice?

06:28.840 --> 06:30.273
Take him someplace nice?

06:30.480 --> 06:33.517
Alan, if I wanna throw away money,
I'll play keno.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.554
- Can I gamble in Vegas?
- No.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.228
- Why am I going?
- Because all the kennels are full.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.238
Now, come on. Let's go.

06:43.400 --> 06:47.154
- Charlie, I haven't packed myself yet.
- What've you been doing?

06:47.360 --> 06:48.873
I changed the phone message...

06:49.040 --> 06:52.350
...to tell people we'd be out of town,
I put together a first aid kit...

06:52.520 --> 06:56.115
...I turned the fridge thermostat down,
because it doesn't have to be cold...

06:56.320 --> 06:58.788
...I called the paper
and stopped delivery...

06:58.960 --> 07:00.791
...and I erased an old <i>Mad Libs</i> book...

07:00.960 --> 07:03.428
...so we'd have something
to entertain us in the car.

07:04.600 --> 07:05.794
- <i>Mad Libs,</i> huh?
- Yeah.

07:05.960 --> 07:07.359
Let me see that.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.239
Go get packed!

07:14.680 --> 07:16.318
Wait until you see Vegas, Jake.

07:16.480 --> 07:20.519
There's action everywhere you look,
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.153
How does that help me?

07:22.320 --> 07:25.198
I can't gamble,
and I have to be in bed at 9:30.

07:25.360 --> 07:28.033
Hey, when we go to Disneyland
do I complain that I hate...

07:28.200 --> 07:32.079
...every aspect of the entire experience?
- Yeah.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.075
Well, then you know how irritating it is.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.431
- Blackjack.
- That's it?

07:40.640 --> 07:42.312
Yep. You owe me another dollar.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.516
- This stinks.
- You wanna quit?

07:45.720 --> 07:47.472
Just deal the cards.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.240
Attaboy.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.638
Uncle Charlie, what's a colonoscopy?

07:53.680 --> 07:56.274
- Didn't your dad tell you?
- He said it was just a test...

07:56.440 --> 07:58.635
...and it was no big deal,
so I looked it up.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.510
- And?
- I don't believe it.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.071
Believe it.

08:05.560 --> 08:08.632
Wouldn't it be easier to go in
the other way?

08:10.720 --> 08:13.917
- You'd think, but no.
- Why do they have to do it?

08:14.120 --> 08:18.193
- They just wanna see what's going on.
- Did Dad lose something?

08:20.280 --> 08:24.637
Because when I swallowed 35 cents,
we just waited for it to come out.

08:25.440 --> 08:29.353
- No kidding.
- Yeah, but I only got 30 cents back.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.230
Well, the house always takes a cut.

08:35.919 --> 08:38.514
- What're you gonna do?
- Hit me.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.789
Okay, okay.
In Vegas, you don't say, "Hit me."

08:40.960 --> 08:42.791
If you want a card, you go like this.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.592
Okay, fine.

08:47.600 --> 08:51.309
- Busted. You owe me another dollar.
- What if I didn't want another card?

08:51.840 --> 08:53.398
You go like this.

08:53.960 --> 08:55.871
That's what I meant to do.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.788
There's no do-overs in Vegas.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.195
What's the signal
to go to the bathroom?

09:02.400 --> 09:04.630
There is no signal,
you just get up and go.

09:04.800 --> 09:08.156
Unless you're on a hot streak,
in which case you sit and wet yourself.

09:08.360 --> 09:11.716
- You're kidding, right?
- You're wearing a $50 pair of slacks...

09:11.880 --> 09:14.269
...and you got $600 on the table,
do the math.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.197
I have to do math and pee my pants?

09:22.200 --> 09:23.428
Alan, are you ready yet?

09:23.640 --> 09:24.914
Just about.

09:25.120 --> 09:29.079
- And where'd I get the $600?
- You've been saying that for 20 minutes.

09:29.240 --> 09:32.357
- What are you doing?
- Financial planning.

09:33.880 --> 09:36.110
I don't wanna look, but I gotta.

09:37.800 --> 09:40.917
In class, if we have to go the bathroom,
we do this or this.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.436
- Get it?
- Yeah. I got it.

09:46.480 --> 09:49.711
Two hundred and eighty, 280, 280.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.838
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hang on. Two... Oh, thanks.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.195
Now you made me lose count.

09:56.080 --> 09:59.197
Ten, 10, 10.
Twenty, 20, 20.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.828
Stop it, stop it.
Why are you doing this?

10:02.400 --> 10:05.358
- I have a system.
- Do tell.

10:05.560 --> 10:08.472
I divide my gambling money
into three equal piles.

10:08.680 --> 10:10.432
The first one is for day one.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.113
That I'll put in my money belt.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.875
You're wearing a money belt?

10:15.040 --> 10:16.632
Oh, good, you can't tell.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.438
I was afraid it made me look chunky.

10:20.160 --> 10:23.835
Anyway, the second pile
is for day two. I'll give that to you...

10:24.000 --> 10:27.197
...under no circumstances do you give
it back to me before midnight...

10:27.360 --> 10:29.237
...which would be
the start of day two.

10:29.440 --> 10:33.035
Un-freaking-believable.
What's the last pile for?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.472
That's the most important pile.

10:35.640 --> 10:39.792
That's the money I hide
in my Frye boot.

10:40.440 --> 10:44.877
- In your boot?
- But I pretend that I don't have it...

10:45.040 --> 10:48.112
...so that if disaster strikes
and I've lost piles one and two...

10:48.280 --> 10:52.239
...then I can pull it out,
and poof, I'm solvent again.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.874
- Okay. I think I understand.
- Pretty clever, huh?

10:56.080 --> 10:57.399
Yeah. That's a nice boot.

10:57.560 --> 10:59.357
- Let me see it.
- Oh, sure.

10:59.520 --> 11:02.751
Get dressed and let's go!

11:17.640 --> 11:19.392
Okay.

11:20.200 --> 11:23.272
- Twenty-one!
- Turn over your hole card.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.471
Oh, 27.

11:26.680 --> 11:29.069
Close, 29.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.273
Okay, I'm good.

11:31.840 --> 11:34.149
Alrighty.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.394
Viva Las Vegas.

11:46.360 --> 11:48.510
- Oh, Alan.
- What?

11:48.720 --> 11:51.109
We're going in a Mercedes,
not a time machine.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.113
Should I change?

11:55.840 --> 11:58.513
You should, but after all these years,
I doubt you will.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.870
- What's this?
- Oh, toiletries, sundries, whatnot.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.349
- Really.
- Yeah, you'll thank me.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.795
Not all hotels supply shower caps
and sewing kits.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.196
Get in the car. Jake, come on.

12:15.360 --> 12:19.353
- Hold on a second.
- Oh, for God's sake. Now what?

12:24.160 --> 12:25.991
Okay, let's go.

12:32.240 --> 12:35.915
- Well, you don't have a fever.
- I told you, he's fine. Let's go.

12:36.080 --> 12:39.231
Charlie, he threw up in
your umbrella stand. Did you miss that?

12:39.440 --> 12:42.034
So? Vegas is full of people
who throw up.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.513
They built that city on a sea of vomit.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.760
- I'm okay, I can go.
- That's the spirit.

12:49.960 --> 12:53.919
You wanna drive five hours with a
puking kid in the back of your Mercedes?

12:54.120 --> 12:57.510
He can stick his head out the window.
Let the guy behind us worry.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.592
- We're not going.
- Oh, come on.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.990
- It's probably just something he ate.
- All right.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.991
What have you eaten
in the last 24 hours?

13:05.160 --> 13:07.594
Well, let's see,
two bowls of Cocoa Puffs...

13:07.760 --> 13:11.594
...a couple blueberry Pop-Tarts,
bag of string cheese.

13:11.760 --> 13:14.399
That reminds me,
we need more string cheese.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.269
Then, for lunch, a Hot Pocket
and a Bagel Bite.

13:18.440 --> 13:24.072
Then dinner, fried chicken, mashed
potatoes and a baloney sandwich.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.033
Okay, it's not what he ate.

13:27.680 --> 13:30.672
Then, for a snack, I had a glass of Tang
and some Cheetos.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.269
That explains the orange vomit.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.879
It's probably a stomach virus.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.832
Oh, please. I throw up all the time.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.276
It's just nature's way of saying,
"Everybody out of the pool."

13:40.480 --> 13:43.233
- I'm putting him to bed. Come on.
- They have beds in Vegas.

13:43.400 --> 13:46.198
- What if he needs a doctor?
- They have doctors in Vegas.

13:46.360 --> 13:49.830
I bet if we looked around, we could find
a casino with a hospital theme.

13:50.040 --> 13:53.237
You know, Caesars Sinai
or something.

13:54.640 --> 13:56.358
I'll get it.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.118
Hello? Hey, Mom.

14:00.920 --> 14:03.150
Fine. Nothing.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.510
I threw up in Uncle Charlie's
umbrella stand...

14:05.680 --> 14:09.070
...and we're going to Vegas.
- No!

14:09.760 --> 14:11.512
What kind of a father are you?

14:11.720 --> 14:14.518
I am a good father.
When he threw up, I cancelled the trip.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.473
But you were planning to take
my 11 -year-old to Las Vegas.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.429
It's really a family town now.

14:21.800 --> 14:25.315
The mob hardly has
any influence at all anymore.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.835
Oh, good, Charlie. That helps.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.031
Were you planning on
telling me about this?

14:30.240 --> 14:32.595
What happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas, Mom.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.952
Oh, good, Jake. That helps.

14:37.120 --> 14:40.192
- Honey, why don't you go lie down.
- Why? I'm fine.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.516
Is it too late to get our bets down
with Coop?

14:42.720 --> 14:44.438
- What bets?
- Who's Coop?

14:44.640 --> 14:47.234
Go lie down. You're delirious.

14:49.440 --> 14:53.433
Listen, Judith, I don't think
you understand what's going on here.

14:53.640 --> 14:54.959
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.230
- You see, this trip was my idea.
- I'm shocked.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.356
Let me finish.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.317
You see, I wanted to cheer Alan up...

15:01.520 --> 15:03.511
Charlie, don't. It's personal.

15:03.680 --> 15:04.999
She has a right to know.

15:05.560 --> 15:08.472
Judith, Alan got some bad news
from the doctor yesterday.

15:08.680 --> 15:10.875
Oh, my God, Alan. What is it?

15:11.040 --> 15:15.989
Well, the doctor says
I have to have a colonoscopy.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.590
- Are you having problems?
- No, it's just routine.

15:19.800 --> 15:24.271
- So?
- So I'm really nervous about it.

15:24.480 --> 15:25.754
That's it?

15:26.280 --> 15:29.875
Well, it's a long, snaky thing
with a camera.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.150
Oh, please. Your son was
10 pounds at birth...

15:32.320 --> 15:34.311
...and his head was
the same size it is now.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.390
That's kind of apples and oranges,
isn't it?

15:37.600 --> 15:39.511
- Goodbye, Alan.
- Wait, wait, wait, Judith.

15:39.680 --> 15:43.036
- Aren't you gonna take Jake with you?
- No, I'm not taking him. He's fine.

15:43.200 --> 15:46.875
Don't think I don't see what's going.
You put Jake up to telling me he's sick...

15:47.040 --> 15:49.634
...so you could pawn him off
while you went to Las Vegas.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.195
He did throw up.
Smell the umbrella stand.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.470
I'm not buying it.
I'll get him Monday night.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.551
And if I find out
you took him to Vegas...

15:56.720 --> 15:59.029
...you'll get a colonoscopy
from my attorney.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.833
I've seen your alimony checks.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.150
You already got one.

16:09.160 --> 16:10.673
So, what's the deal?
Are we going?

16:10.880 --> 16:12.950
- I don't think so.
- Why? I'm fine.

16:13.160 --> 16:16.630
- Yeah, but your mom said, "No."
- Oh, man.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.234
Don't eat anything orange.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.953
- You wanna know what I think?
- Not at all.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.390
I think if she wanted to
keep you on a leash...

16:25.560 --> 16:29.155
...she shouldn't have divorced you.
- I'm not on a leash. I never was.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.072
You were living here
for three weeks...

16:31.240 --> 16:34.277
...before you were getting up
on the couch without permission.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.871
Can we just drop it?
It was a bad idea.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.914
There are no bad ideas. There's just
a lack of will to execute them.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.868
We're men, Alan. Single men.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.958
We go where we want, when we want
and how we want.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.951
Usually without so much toiletries...

16:50.120 --> 16:53.590
...but I'm trying to be flexible here.
- I explained about the toiletries.

16:53.800 --> 16:57.076
The point is, you can't let your ex-wife
control your behavior...

16:57.240 --> 16:59.800
...no matter how stupid
or self-destructive it might be.

16:59.960 --> 17:02.679
- Charlie, l...
- What profit a man...

17:02.880 --> 17:05.598
...if he escapes the iron shackles
of matrimony...

17:05.760 --> 17:10.992
...only to surrender to sexually frustrated
tyranny of a vengeful ex-wife?

17:14.359 --> 17:15.759
You know what? You're right.

17:15.920 --> 17:17.512
- We're men.
- Right, are you with me?

17:17.720 --> 17:20.233
- I'm with you.
- Grab your pack, we're going to Vegas.

17:22.079 --> 17:24.674
- Jake?
- Just a sec.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.835
It's okay. It's mostly water.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.917
I'm fine. Let's go. We're men.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.832
Nope. You're too sick.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.797
Some other time.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.315
I'm really sorry I ruined the trip,
Uncle Charlie.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.839
Hey, it's not your fault.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.831
It's your dad who won't let you go.

17:48.280 --> 17:50.840
- Thanks, Charlie.
- Why should he feel guilty?

17:51.640 --> 17:54.677
Here. Put this on Wake Forest.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.830
Game's over, Jake. They lost.

17:59.040 --> 18:02.919
- What about the spread?
- They didn't cover.

18:04.440 --> 18:05.714
Give me back my money.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.553
Get some rest.

18:09.720 --> 18:12.837
- I'm hungry.
- Get used to it.

18:15.280 --> 18:17.953
- That's some great kid.
- Yeah.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.918
Sick as a dog,
and all he wants is a little action.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.672
Well, he gets that from you.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.154
You think so?

18:24.320 --> 18:28.199
- Because I do try to be a role model.
- I know you do.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.073
Listen, there's no reason
you have to stick around.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.151
He's gonna sleep.
I can keep an eye on him.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.078
No, no, I couldn't go now.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.555
Why not? You wanted to go to Vegas.
You should go.

18:37.720 --> 18:40.712
You're probably gonna have a better time
without Jake and me.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.150
Probably? Unquestionably.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.430
- Then why don't you go?
- I don't know.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.751
It just feels somehow wrong
to abandon the kid when he's sick.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.315
Now you know what it feels like
to be a parent.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.636
How inconvenient.

18:55.640 --> 18:59.633
- What's that?
- It sounds like Lynyrd Skynyrd.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.672
Berta?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.911
Surprise!

19:28.160 --> 19:29.639
I'm gonna start the IV.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.756
In a few seconds,
you're gonna feel drowsy.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.992
No. No drowsy.
I wanna be out. Completely out.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.792
Don't worry, you will be.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.474
- Right, doctor?
- Aye.

19:39.680 --> 19:43.798
You won't be remembering anything,
me bucko.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.910
Thanks, doc. Here's the 2 grand
for your children's hospital.

19:56.400 --> 19:59.870
And remember, when he wakes up,
you're a gas station attendant.
