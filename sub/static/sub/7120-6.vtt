00:12.667 --> 00:14.896
BMO, turn the music down.

00:15.909 --> 00:18.245
BMO! Turn it down!

00:22.721 --> 00:25.400
Come on BMO you're messing up my game!

00:26.937 --> 00:28.548
Hey, dude can I borrow that paper?

00:31.792 --> 00:34.385
Bad computer! No! No!

00:34.420 --> 00:37.350
Now go sit in the corner
and think about your life.

00:45.710 --> 00:47.646
Snail attack!

00:55.344 --> 00:56.521
Oh, sick!

00:56.556 --> 00:58.945
Dude, how do you fight a snail?!

00:58.980 --> 01:01.731
Hold on! I got this!

01:02.890 --> 01:05.104
Don't make me use this, man!

01:06.307 --> 01:09.330
But I heard you guys were heroes.

01:09.365 --> 01:10.343
We are heroes.

01:10.378 --> 01:12.174
We thought you were trying to attack us.

01:12.209 --> 01:15.330
Why'd you break in here all mad,
squirting that juice all over us?

01:15.439 --> 01:18.942
It's not mad juice. It's sad juice.

01:18.977 --> 01:24.148
My name's Snorlock, and I'm sa-a-a-a-d!

01:25.809 --> 01:27.187
Stop squirting slime!

01:27.222 --> 01:28.492
Just tell us what's wrong!

01:28.527 --> 01:33.186
I need a girlfriend. I have no one to love.

01:33.221 --> 01:35.160
Jake, hero huddle.

01:35.628 --> 01:36.500
What do you think?

01:36.500 --> 01:38.710
I think our house is all jacked up.

01:38.745 --> 01:41.673
Yeah, but he's just an innocent goober looking for love.

01:43.417 --> 01:44.978
Yeah. Okay, let's help him.

01:45.013 --> 01:46.978
But he's got to lay off the house.

01:47.013 --> 01:48.950
Right! All right, man.

01:48.985 --> 01:50.857
We'll help you hook up as long as you -

01:50.892 --> 01:51.650
Yay!

02:02.282 --> 02:04.227
Lay off the house, man!

02:05.694 --> 02:08.170
You guys... won't help me?

02:09.987 --> 02:12.049
All right! all right! We'll help you, dude!

02:12.084 --> 02:13.690
Just put our house back!

02:13.725 --> 02:16.867
Okay! Right after I get a girlfriend.

02:18.524 --> 02:21.268
All right, you big crazy.
It's a deal!

02:23.871 --> 02:26.195
Jake, what time is it?!

02:26.195 --> 02:28.872
I don't know, but you're
probably going to say...

02:32.704 --> 02:35.982
Okay, Snorlock, if you want a
lady, you have to be yourself.

02:35.982 --> 02:37.675
How do I be myself?

02:37.675 --> 02:39.876
Uh, how does he be himself, Jake?

02:39.911 --> 02:41.581
Just do whatever you want, man,

02:41.616 --> 02:43.646
as long as it comes from the inside.

02:43.681 --> 02:45.263
Like sad juice?

02:45.298 --> 02:45.868
No!

02:45.903 --> 02:48.008
You keep that stuff inside you, brother.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.427
You just got to talk to 'em.

02:49.462 --> 02:51.906
Oh. I never done that.

02:51.941 --> 02:54.302
Finn, you see any hot mamas?

02:58.168 --> 02:59.458
Go talk to her!

03:00.093 --> 03:01.780
Go talk to her!

03:01.815 --> 03:03.162
okay.

03:08.392 --> 03:09.887
Oh! Hello.

03:09.922 --> 03:11.268
Hi.

03:11.303 --> 03:15.362
Mm. You seem like a reasonable male.

03:15.397 --> 03:17.700
We should go to a movie sometime.

03:17.735 --> 03:19.054
He's got this.

03:20.221 --> 03:21.850
I like old movies.

03:24.555 --> 03:26.224
Um, are you okay?

03:30.111 --> 03:31.626
Girlfriend! Girlfriend!

03:38.001 --> 03:40.596
Dude! our house! We got to do something!

03:40.631 --> 03:42.289
Relax. I got it.

03:42.324 --> 03:45.011
Snorlock! Hey, Snorlock.

03:45.046 --> 03:47.959
You okay, buddy? Went a little nuts there, guy.

03:47.994 --> 03:49.814
You got to get that under control,

03:49.849 --> 03:52.722
'cause you're scaring ladies and jacking up our house.

03:52.757 --> 03:56.851
I'm sorry. Are you gonna leave me?

03:56.886 --> 03:58.908
Aw, who could leave you?

03:58.908 --> 04:00.996
Come here, you big hot mess.

04:01.031 --> 04:02.429
Break it up, you two!

04:02.464 --> 04:04.089
We have ladies to attend to!

04:04.124 --> 04:06.018
Yeah, the ladies.

04:06.053 --> 04:08.901
Talking to ladies is hard.

04:08.936 --> 04:09.711
No, it's not.

04:09.746 --> 04:11.010
Check it out, Snorlock.

04:11.045 --> 04:13.726
Finn, you be the guy snail,
and I'll be...

04:14.777 --> 04:16.398
the chick snail.

04:16.398 --> 04:18.625
Ugh! gross, Jake!

04:18.660 --> 04:20.488
Come on, man. We're just pretending.

04:20.523 --> 04:21.822
Do it for love.

04:25.639 --> 04:28.012
Okay. I'll do it for this guy.

04:29.821 --> 04:31.430
What's up, lady snail?

04:31.465 --> 04:35.496
Well, I'm just sitting here
thinking about mating with snails.

04:35.531 --> 04:38.129
No! I can't do this, man!

04:38.164 --> 04:39.442
I-am-out!

04:40.217 --> 04:41.999
I'll mate with you.

04:42.034 --> 04:43.992
We're just role playing, buddy.

04:45.135 --> 04:48.487
Here, Finn. This time you be the
chick and I'll be the snail dude.

04:52.382 --> 04:54.485
Hey, baby. what's up?

04:59.883 --> 05:01.994
Girl you smell good.

05:02.029 --> 05:05.904
Did you take a bath in
rainbows and cupcakes?

05:06.745 --> 05:11.334
- Say "yes"!
- Say "yes"!

05:11.369 --> 05:12.602
Okay! Yes!

05:12.637 --> 05:14.899
See, Snorlock?
Talking to ladies is easy.

05:14.934 --> 05:16.227
Just act like me.

05:22.858 --> 05:26.136
Uh... girl, you smell good.

05:26.171 --> 05:27.696
You can smell me?

05:30.132 --> 05:32.056
May I smell you more?

05:32.091 --> 05:34.199
Uh, okay.

05:36.568 --> 05:38.203
Cupcakes...

05:39.353 --> 05:40.665
Uh, I have to go.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.095
Did you take a bath?

05:42.130 --> 05:43.832
Don't ever talk to me again.

05:43.867 --> 05:48.089
Please don't go!
Don't go!

05:51.234 --> 05:54.534
Aw, it's okay, buddy.
Come here and give us a hug.

05:54.569 --> 05:57.739
Man, I wish you guys were ladies.

05:58.737 --> 06:00.204
Stay focused, Snorlock.

06:01.066 --> 06:04.022
You have any cool talents that ladies might like?

06:04.057 --> 06:04.789
No.

06:06.004 --> 06:08.070
Finn, teach him how to use swords.

06:08.957 --> 06:11.775
The princesses always love this one.

06:17.276 --> 06:19.114
Do you think you can do that, Snorlock?

06:19.574 --> 06:20.810
I don't know.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.210
Hmm. Maybe you're musical.

06:23.245 --> 06:24.248
Can you do this?

06:31.632 --> 06:33.061
Try doing all that.

06:48.957 --> 06:52.544
My word, Eleanor!
What is that alluring sound?

06:52.726 --> 06:54.392
I have no idea.

06:54.427 --> 06:56.899
Yeah, Snorlock! Show us that talent!

07:02.696 --> 07:03.784
Oh, my! What is that?

07:03.819 --> 07:05.207
What is that wonderful sound?

07:05.242 --> 07:06.565
Do I see swords?

07:07.575 --> 07:09.439
Jake, these chicks look pretty serious.

07:09.474 --> 07:13.159
Let's just let Snorlock do his thing.

07:14.844 --> 07:16.430
Go to it, buddy!

07:22.822 --> 07:26.295
Look at him go!
Bringing in the ladies.

07:27.296 --> 07:29.864
Uh, he's bringing in a lot of ladies.

07:43.607 --> 07:47.703
Snorlock! These ladies are
ruining our tree house! Stop!

07:57.373 --> 07:58.859
Wedge, dude!

08:04.246 --> 08:06.682
It's no use, man. It's stuck with snail slime.

08:12.204 --> 08:13.912
How are we gonna get our house back?

08:20.497 --> 08:22.317
Salt!

08:26.438 --> 08:28.578
Dude, I'm going in!

08:31.062 --> 08:33.369
You'll get slimmed or grinded on!

08:54.373 --> 08:58.245
Snorlock, I'm gonna give you
till the count of three, mister!

09:04.918 --> 09:07.383
Fine. I didn't want to have to do this.

09:30.770 --> 09:33.882
- Oh my gosh!
- He is naked!

09:35.766 --> 09:39.079
What? I'm naked?
But I never had a shell!

09:39.114 --> 09:41.821
Snorlock, you never a shell?

09:41.822 --> 09:45.381
That means you're not
naked. You're a slug!

09:46.135 --> 09:47.681
Me? A slug?

09:47.716 --> 09:50.834
Yeah, man. That's why you
have trouble with snail chicks.

09:50.869 --> 09:52.421
 You need slug chicks.

09:52.422 --> 09:55.439
I don't know any slug chicks!

09:55.474 --> 09:59.080
Actually, I-I'm not really a snail. 

10:00.307 --> 10:03.547
I'm a slug. My shell's made of peppermint.

10:09.902 --> 10:11.667
That's gross! 

10:11.702 --> 10:14.677
I don't know why did they have
to make out so close to our house.

10:14.712 --> 10:17.418
I don't know. Come on. Let's finish rebuilding it. 

10:17.453 --> 10:19.028
I got some ear plugs you can borrow.

10:20.769 --> 10:22.831
Where's that music coming from?

10:27.146 --> 10:30.408
BMO! Get over here and help us rebuild the tree house.

10:30.443 --> 10:32.393
Yeah. You live here, too!
