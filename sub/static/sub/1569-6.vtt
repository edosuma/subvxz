WEBVTT

00:08.119 --> 00:09.451
<i>I'm Peggy Carter.</i>

00:09.520 --> 00:10.806
<i>- I work for the SSR,</i>

00:10.880 --> 00:13.360
<i>America's premier
covert intelligence agency.</i>

00:13.440 --> 00:15.010
<i>But now that the war is over,</i>

00:15.080 --> 00:16.570
<i>my mission parameters
these days are...</i>

00:16.640 --> 00:18.005
Agent Carter, cover the phones.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.121
<i>...different.</i>

00:19.200 --> 00:20.725
<i>That all changed when an old friend</i>

00:20.800 --> 00:22.529
<i>asked me to become a double agent.</i>

00:22.600 --> 00:24.568
I have a vault.
Somebody cleaned me out.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.165
A couple of weeks later,
my inventions...

00:26.240 --> 00:27.969
They start turning up
on the black market.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.371
<i>He left me with an ally.</i>

00:29.440 --> 00:31.363
Edwin Jarvis.
He'll help you in any way he can.

00:31.440 --> 00:34.250
As of this moment, Howard Stark
is a fugitive from justice.

00:34.320 --> 00:35.924
You're the only one
that can clear my name.

00:39.640 --> 00:40.687
Who did this to you?

00:40.760 --> 00:43.047
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.121
Who is Leviathan?

00:44.200 --> 00:45.611
It's a covert Russian organization.

00:45.680 --> 00:47.205
<i>Rumors had it, after the war,</i>

00:47.280 --> 00:49.601
<i>their group wanted to purchase
weapons to fight the Allies.</i>

00:52.560 --> 00:53.607
Doc, need a ride home?

00:53.680 --> 00:55.603
The SSR could use your help
fighting Leviathan.

00:55.680 --> 00:56.886
I'll do anything I can.

00:57.160 --> 00:58.889
Forgot my compass.
Would you grab that for me, pal?

00:58.960 --> 01:00.200
- Bloody nora!
- Whoa, nelly!

01:01.080 --> 01:02.650
Is there anything else, Daniel?

01:02.720 --> 01:03.767
Uh...

01:28.760 --> 01:31.240
My most
heartfelt congratulations.

01:31.360 --> 01:35.046
You have all been selected
to join Leviathan.

01:35.840 --> 01:37.842
This is indeed a great honor for you.

01:37.920 --> 01:41.686
Soon, you will know the glory
of devoting your life to a greater good.

01:42.120 --> 01:43.724
Before we continue,

01:43.800 --> 01:47.805
if there are any among you
who wish to decline this opportunity,

01:48.240 --> 01:51.403
the time to speak is now.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.570
I have a wife.

01:55.520 --> 01:58.205
I have four daughters.

01:58.560 --> 01:59.641
They need me.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.290
You wish to decline, then?

02:01.360 --> 02:03.283
If I may, sir.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.923
You would like
to be with your family.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.361
Very good.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.002
Relieve him of his bonds.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.891
His family, all of them,

02:22.960 --> 02:25.042
will be joining him shortly.

02:25.120 --> 02:28.488
Are there any others who wish
to reunite with their loved ones?

02:28.560 --> 02:30.608
You, perhaps?

02:32.120 --> 02:33.485
<i>That was when I learned</i>

02:34.440 --> 02:36.249
monsters are real,

02:37.160 --> 02:40.209
and there is none
more terrifying than Leviathan.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.725
Here I thought it was just something

02:41.800 --> 02:44.167
they told the apple-knockers
to scare them.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.525
How long has Leviathan been active?

02:46.600 --> 02:48.568
Since after the Great War.

02:48.640 --> 02:53.202
Stalin's goal is for Russia
to become a leading power in the world,

02:53.680 --> 02:57.890
which means having better weapons
than our enemies and our allies.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.531
Leviathan has been very successful.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.329
Mechanical, biological...

03:02.400 --> 03:05.370
Human? Is that what that
young girl was, a human weapon?

03:05.440 --> 03:07.841
My knowledge of specific operations

03:07.920 --> 03:10.446
is sadly restricted
to only what I was told.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.727
That building seemed to house
a training facility.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.290
Shackles on the beds, classrooms.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.681
Training young girls
to be what, assassins?

03:16.800 --> 03:18.689
Seems like the Russians
would want to train grown men.

03:18.800 --> 03:22.407
Women are often overlooked,
taken for granted.

03:22.480 --> 03:25.290
They can slip easily
through a man's defenses.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.566
How many girls were there?

03:26.640 --> 03:28.369
- Again, I was not allowed...
- Do you think

03:28.440 --> 03:30.204
the girls could have been
deployed here, to America?

03:30.280 --> 03:32.442
I wish I could be of more assistance,
Agent Carter...

03:32.520 --> 03:33.931
Who could be of more assistance,
Dr. Ivchenko?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.207
Agent Carter... A word.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.568
Chief Dooley, I really must insist
you allow me to continue to...

03:43.640 --> 03:45.642
Carter, could you
just zip it for a minute? Geez.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.763
Look, your work in Russia
was admirable,

03:48.840 --> 03:50.330
but this is still my operation.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.846
And I need to hear everything
he has to say about Leviathan.

03:52.960 --> 03:53.961
And as callous as it sounds,

03:54.040 --> 03:55.166
I don't really care
about some little girl...

03:55.240 --> 03:57.208
Well, you should,
because that little girl, I believe,

03:57.280 --> 03:58.725
grew up to kill Agent Krzeminski.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.080
Where did you come up
with that theory?

04:00.160 --> 04:02.242
Ballistics identified the firearm
that killed Krzeminski

04:02.320 --> 04:04.448
to be a Korovin TK, a Russian gun.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.170
- So?
- Not only that, it's small.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.481
Small enough to be
more suitable for a woman's grip.

04:08.600 --> 04:09.761
Ah. That's thin.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.569
It's also the most plausible explanation

04:11.640 --> 04:14.246
of how Howard Stark got involved
with this in the first place.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.004
He is a notorious womanizer.

04:16.079 --> 04:18.447
The story of the vault break-in
can only ring true

04:18.519 --> 04:21.887
if he were manipulated
by a well-trained female operative.

04:21.959 --> 04:22.927
You know what?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.843
This is so much bigger
than your buddy Howard Stark.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.081
- I can...
- Yes, it is.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.247
And now, after everything you know,

04:27.320 --> 04:29.209
do you really think
that he's involved with Leviathan?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.082
All right. Chase it.

04:34.760 --> 04:36.171
- Sir?
- You got a hunch?

04:36.240 --> 04:37.730
See if you're right.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.170
Would you look at that.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.050
You really can keep your mouth shut
when you try.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.882
Now get the hell out of here.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.887
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.200
"When I look back on it,

04:56.280 --> 04:59.568
"it seems to me as if I have been
living here like a poor woman,

05:00.560 --> 05:02.528
"just from hand to mouth.

05:03.960 --> 05:08.204
"I have existed merely
to perform tricks for you, Torvald.

05:09.040 --> 05:11.088
"But you would have it so.

05:11.160 --> 05:15.324
"You and Papa have committed
a great sin against me.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.802
"It is your fault that
I have made nothing of my life."

05:18.920 --> 05:20.729
- Bravo, Angie.
- Oh.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.003
Thanks, Esther.

05:26.720 --> 05:27.721
Your new key.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.485
I had to practically sign over my
firstborn to Miriam to get this for you.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.648
Thank you. I can't imagine
where I dropped mine.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.370
Angie, that was wonderful.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.683
Ugh. Tell that to the producers.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.762
They said it was the worst audition
they'd ever seen.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.448
- You ordering?
- No, I'm waiting for a friend.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.764
Angie, you can't just
let one audition get you down.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.080
How about seven?

05:45.160 --> 05:47.561
Oh, I'm sorry, but things will look up.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.364
I've been telling myself that for a year.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.851
Time to take the hint.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.400
The floodlights are calling,
but not for me.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.763
My father signed me up
for secretary school.

05:56.840 --> 05:57.841
I start next week.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.644
Oh, Angie, no. You belong onstage.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.291
If that were true, I'd be there already.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.886
We'll talk about this
when I get home tonight.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.246
Nothing to say.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.005
I'll let you and your friend talk.

06:17.280 --> 06:20.204
I must say, I was very pleased
to receive your call.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.725
Can I assume you're back on the team?

06:21.800 --> 06:24.087
I don't believe we ever were
on the same team, so no.

06:24.160 --> 06:26.606
We are still, however,
working towards a common goal.

06:26.680 --> 06:28.125
Fair enough.

06:28.240 --> 06:31.244
It may interest you to know
that your superior paid me a visit.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.163
- Chief Dooley?
- Yes.

06:33.640 --> 06:36.883
It seems there may be a change
in the prevailing winds within the SSR.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.604
Leviathan has certainly
sparked their interest,

06:38.680 --> 06:40.808
but Howard isn't
out of the woods just yet.

06:40.920 --> 06:41.967
What did Dooley want?

06:42.040 --> 06:44.611
Information on a battle
in the German town of Finow.

06:45.160 --> 06:49.961
I didn't say anything at the time,
but Mr. Stark did visit Finow in 1944.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.327
He returned...distressed,

06:52.400 --> 06:54.448
and soon after
began construction on his vault.

06:54.520 --> 06:55.965
What did Howard have to say about it?

06:56.040 --> 06:58.327
I've tried getting messages to him.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.448
However, he's been difficult to reach.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.329
Hmm. Interesting, but that can wait.

07:02.440 --> 07:05.250
Russia has been training young women
to be undercover operatives,

07:05.360 --> 07:07.010
and we both know that
Howard's major weakness is...

07:07.080 --> 07:08.081
Women.

07:08.160 --> 07:10.288
And raspberry truffles.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.362
I need you to get me
a list of all the women

07:12.440 --> 07:15.250
that Howard has entertained
in the last year.

07:15.320 --> 07:18.608
I'm not sure there's
enough ink in the whole of New York

07:18.680 --> 07:20.125
- to complete that request.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.725
Fine. Just in the last six months, then.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.643
- Is that possible?
- Oh, yes.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.606
Yes, I suggest we start
with the western hemisphere.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.603
Oh, please.

07:56.880 --> 07:57.961
You here for the interview?

07:58.360 --> 07:59.407
That's me.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.166
Come on in.

08:01.240 --> 08:02.890
I was about to give up
on seeing any more girls.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.331
Are you closed?

08:04.400 --> 08:06.323
Oh, I gave the rest of the staff
a long weekend.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.448
I like to spend extra time
with the applicants,

08:08.520 --> 08:09.885
give them my full attention.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.846
Bring yourself this way
and, uh, we'll get started.

08:46.520 --> 08:48.284
Hey, Sheldon. You look great.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.165
How they treating you in here?

08:50.240 --> 08:53.084
Warm cot? Three squares?
Been stabbed yet?

08:53.160 --> 08:54.366
What the hell do you want?

08:54.440 --> 08:56.681
Just a little trip down memory lane.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.684
When we arrested you,
you said some lady beat you up,

08:59.760 --> 09:02.411
- cuffed you to a chair.
- Yeah, yeah.

09:02.520 --> 09:03.567
Hey, why don't we, uh...

09:03.640 --> 09:05.290
Why don't we keep that
under our hats, okay?

09:05.360 --> 09:06.725
Think you could identify her?

09:06.800 --> 09:09.201
Maybe. Maybe not.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.361
What are you gonna do for me?

09:10.440 --> 09:12.886
Six months. Probably get it knocked
down to three if you behave yourself.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.291
- That's it?
- Let me remind you

09:14.360 --> 09:16.328
you were arrested
for transporting an explosive

09:16.400 --> 09:19.051
that could level all of New York.

09:19.160 --> 09:22.528
This is a one-time offer. We got a deal?

09:24.720 --> 09:26.643
Yeah, we got a deal.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.723
Oh, yeah. That's her.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.161
You sure?

09:38.240 --> 09:40.083
Yeah, I'm sure.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.242
Take another look. Look.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.845
She came to the house that night.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.604
She was looking for Brannis.

09:45.680 --> 09:49.321
She left with him
and the truck full of Nitramene.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.850
She's a cute broad,

09:53.360 --> 09:55.522
when she's not punching me
in the face.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.011
Who is she?

09:58.240 --> 10:00.322
Not who I thought she was.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.483
We call it the Stark Special,

10:08.560 --> 10:10.927
custom-designed to
his exact specifications.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.889
Are you saying Howard Stark
buys a bracelet

10:12.960 --> 10:14.405
- for every woman he's...
- Oh, no.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.001
Yes.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.845
He considers it a parting gift
to commemorate their time together.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.969
Mr. Stark demands
only the highest quality diamonds,

10:22.040 --> 10:23.280
the highest karat of gold.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.727
Any girl would be lucky
to wear such a fine piece.

10:25.800 --> 10:26.961
Would you like to try it on?

10:27.040 --> 10:28.041
No, thank you very much.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.122
If we could just see the list,
we'll be on our way.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.248
Anything for friends of Mr. Stark.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.563
Oh, it's shorter
than I thought it would be.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.404
How could he possibly meet
this many women?

10:39.480 --> 10:41.528
Well, the Academy Awards
is a very busy time.

10:43.760 --> 10:44.807
What are you doing?

10:44.880 --> 10:46.325
A large portion of the women on this list

10:46.400 --> 10:49.006
are well-known actresses,
models, and socialites,

10:49.080 --> 10:50.969
publicly established for several years.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.166
They can be disregarded.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.689
Well, I wouldn't dismiss her.

10:54.760 --> 10:57.001
You think Ginger Rogers
is a Russian assassin?

10:57.080 --> 10:58.127
You should have seen her eyes

10:58.200 --> 11:01.283
when I escorted her
from Mr. Stark's villa.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.249
The darkest gates to the abyss.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.008
I get girl after girl in here,
and for what?

11:08.080 --> 11:09.366
They're just waiting
for their future husbands

11:09.480 --> 11:11.642
to come walking through that door
complaining about a cavity.

11:13.560 --> 11:16.006
I'm looking for someone with ambition,

11:16.080 --> 11:19.004
someone who's, um,
willing to go the extra mile.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.881
So tell me, Dottie,
are you that someone?

11:28.440 --> 11:29.566
Help! I'm being...

11:35.840 --> 11:38.286
- Never used one of these before.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.805
- Open wide.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.804
Into the breach!

11:54.800 --> 11:55.961
Aren't you coming?

11:56.040 --> 11:58.407
I thought I might
sit this one out, actually.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.687
I need you to positively
identify these women.

12:00.760 --> 12:01.761
Stop dawdling and come along.

12:02.760 --> 12:05.843
It's just that with
Mr. Stark's tendency to, um...

12:06.520 --> 12:07.760
Prematurely evacuate?

12:08.800 --> 12:10.131
When he ends a relationship,

12:10.200 --> 12:13.090
he prefers to do so by proxy,
and that proxy is me.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.321
Ugh.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.568
Suffice to say,

12:17.640 --> 12:19.563
these encounters
could be disagreeable.

12:19.640 --> 12:21.085
We're not having dinner
with these women.

12:21.160 --> 12:22.491
I just need to see their wrists.

12:22.560 --> 12:23.766
You're looking for the bracelet?

12:23.840 --> 12:26.286
Not quite. The girl in Russia
had scars on her wrists

12:26.360 --> 12:27.486
from being cuffed to the bed.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.649
If my theory is correct,
our spy will have those same scars.

12:30.720 --> 12:31.960
Surely you could devise a way

12:32.040 --> 12:33.963
to see these women's wrists
without involving me.

12:34.040 --> 12:37.044
Maybe, but it would be
more complicated and less fun.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.360
Come along, Mr. Jarvis.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.722
- Oh.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.884
No, I haven't seen Howard Stark,
and I don't want to.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.923
He's a no-good, dirty, low-down snake.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.765
As if he could buy me off with a trinket.
I'm not that kind of girl.

12:51.840 --> 12:54.764
If I did that, if any girl did that,
you know what people would call her?

12:54.840 --> 12:56.080
A floozy, that's what.

12:56.160 --> 12:57.321
<i>He should be shamed.</i>

12:57.400 --> 12:59.641
He should be judged,
and so should you for helping him.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.927
Tell him if I ever see him
just scatting about town,

13:02.040 --> 13:04.247
- I'm gonna...
- Show him the business end of this!

13:19.400 --> 13:21.050
Well, Mr. Stark would seem to have

13:21.120 --> 13:23.407
an unfortunate attraction
to violent women.

13:23.480 --> 13:26.484
I imagine they were far less violent
before they met him.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.210
Ida Emke is next.

13:28.280 --> 13:31.250
Yes, a dancer he met
at a charity auction, I believe.

13:31.320 --> 13:32.970
- Hmm.
- No, maybe the caterer.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.122
His variety is staggering.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.089
According to this, she's close by.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.491
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.404
So there's nothing
you can tell me about these?

13:43.480 --> 13:46.131
Please forgive me. I was not engineer.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.168
I was merely psychiatrist.

13:48.240 --> 13:50.322
Do you know
where Leviathan got them?

13:50.400 --> 13:53.324
From where governments
usually get secrets, I imagine.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.050
They stole them.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.046
Let's take a break. How about a drink?

13:59.080 --> 14:01.367
Thank you. How about two?

14:08.680 --> 14:10.364
<i>Na zdorovie.</i>

14:14.760 --> 14:15.921
Ah!

14:19.120 --> 14:20.610
You're having some troubles at home?

14:22.360 --> 14:23.407
What are you talking about?

14:23.720 --> 14:27.884
Mmm, the blanket and the pillow
and the toothbrush, razor.

14:28.480 --> 14:29.481
Nature of the job.

14:30.680 --> 14:32.728
You got to be prepared
for some late nights.

14:32.800 --> 14:36.361
- But you have framed photo...
- Mmm-hmm.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.090
...facedown on the credenza,

14:38.160 --> 14:39.810
while the photo
of your charming children

14:39.880 --> 14:41.803
is displayed with pride.

14:42.640 --> 14:47.931
I can only assume that
slighted photo is of your wife.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.051
And if I had to guess,

14:50.120 --> 14:54.125
I would say that you do not spend
much time in your own bed.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.691
I apologize.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.206
I have gone too far.
I am a fool.

15:01.440 --> 15:02.601
Don't worry about it.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.925
There's just so much water
under the bridge

15:29.000 --> 15:30.331
between me and Loretta,

15:30.400 --> 15:32.050
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.609
Is that Empire State Building?

15:38.680 --> 15:40.842
No, that's over on Fifth.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.531
Huh. There are so many
tall buildings here, yes?

15:44.520 --> 15:46.045
Go ahead. Open the window.

15:56.520 --> 15:57.965
Wow.

15:58.280 --> 16:00.009
The buildings stretch out forever.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.849
Careful. Don't fall out.

16:05.920 --> 16:10.289
You know, this city is unlike anything
I have ever seen before.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.727
And you are telling me
there is one building

16:12.800 --> 16:14.245
taller than all of these?

16:15.080 --> 16:16.650
Tell you what.

16:16.720 --> 16:19.200
Soon as this is all over,

16:19.280 --> 16:21.806
I'll see about
getting you a personal tour.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.166
Hell, I'll even take you myself.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.605
One hundred and three stories.

16:46.680 --> 16:48.170
You guys get <i>King Kong</i>
over in Russia?

16:48.240 --> 16:49.321
Of course.

16:53.400 --> 16:56.244
Fay Wray.
Oh, I had a thing for her.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.207
Miss Emke?

17:52.640 --> 17:54.404
No one home. What a shame. Shall we?

17:55.120 --> 17:57.805
Uh, keep an eye on the hallway.
Knock if there's danger.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.490
Hello.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.288
I'm the exterminator.

18:24.360 --> 18:26.362
Somebody saw a roach.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.211
I have to catch these things
before they get out of hand.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.651
Shouldn't your mother
be somewhere nearby?

18:48.880 --> 18:50.723
I think I hear her calling you.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.211
Please go away.

19:00.720 --> 19:01.801
Who were you talking to?

19:01.880 --> 19:03.609
A future mafioso.

19:03.680 --> 19:05.728
- Did you find anything useful?
- Ida's long gone.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.041
The room's completely empty,
but she's definitely our girl.

19:08.120 --> 19:10.851
- Oh. How can you tell?
- Uh, scratches on the bedposts.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.610
Remember, the Russian girls
were handcuffed to the beds

19:12.680 --> 19:13.841
from a very young age.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.570
Are you suggesting she's still doing it?

19:15.640 --> 19:17.324
That must be a very hard habit to break.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.482
- That is immensely disturbing.
- I'll knock on a few doors,

19:19.560 --> 19:21.369
see if any of the neighbors
know where Ida may have gone.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.886
In the meantime, see if you can
track down the owners of the building.

19:23.960 --> 19:25.291
They may have a paper trail on her.

19:25.360 --> 19:27.044
Meet me back at the Automat,
and let's move fast.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.009
We're close. I can feel it.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.609
He was 4-F.

19:37.640 --> 19:40.723
I'm off risking my neck,
serving my country,

19:40.800 --> 19:43.849
she cheats on me
with some jerk from Hoboken.

19:43.920 --> 19:47.925
You feel that
it was more than a betrayal.

19:49.240 --> 19:52.210
Overseas, you rose
to high-ranking officer

19:52.280 --> 19:55.045
and proved yourself again and again.

19:55.120 --> 19:59.091
Here, she is just showing you
your inadequacies.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.810
I am not inadequate.

20:01.280 --> 20:04.170
A plumber with flat feet,
that's inadequate.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.726
That background check you asked for.

20:09.800 --> 20:10.926
Thanks, Yowch.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.490
It's actually "Yawk."

20:16.280 --> 20:17.884
You waiting for a tip or something?

20:17.960 --> 20:19.450
The chief's been in there
a real long time

20:19.520 --> 20:20.601
with that Russian guy.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.808
Well, that Russian guy
happens to be a huge lead

20:22.880 --> 20:25.326
in our case against Stark, Agent.

20:25.400 --> 20:28.404
Chief is just taking extra time
to make sure he gets everything right.

20:28.480 --> 20:29.641
You have a problem with that?

20:29.720 --> 20:30.801
I'm just saying

20:30.880 --> 20:32.962
it's different from
how he usually handles things.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.202
And I'm just saying don't worry
about what Dooley's doing.

20:35.280 --> 20:36.327
Okay?

20:36.400 --> 20:39.404
Now, why don't you go
brew a pot of coffee?

20:40.600 --> 20:42.045
Saw it was getting low.

20:44.600 --> 20:45.567
Okay.

20:45.680 --> 20:48.650
I lost my wife and children to Leviathan.

20:49.480 --> 20:50.606
I'm sorry.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.001
I do not say this for your pity,

20:53.640 --> 20:57.611
but only to show you
that you have lost nothing.

20:57.680 --> 21:00.081
It is too late for me to save my family.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.162
It is not too late for you to save yours.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.282
Yeah, and how am I supposed to
work that miracle?

21:04.800 --> 21:08.282
You cannot
in your current frame of mind.

21:09.360 --> 21:12.842
You must focus on the good times,

21:14.200 --> 21:18.569
when you and your wife
were in love and happy.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.327
That's supposed to help?

21:20.400 --> 21:21.606
Yes.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.970
Just focus.

21:25.320 --> 21:27.209
On her smile.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.884
On her laugh.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.843
Everything that you love about her.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.005
Focus.

21:38.520 --> 21:40.522
Chief, I got something for you.

21:41.680 --> 21:44.126
I'm in the middle of something, Sousa.
Can it wait?

21:44.240 --> 21:46.242
No. It can't.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.331
Here you go, ladies.

22:03.080 --> 22:04.889
- Good here? Yeah? Mmm-hmm?
- Uh-huh.

22:12.560 --> 22:13.561
Any luck?

22:14.080 --> 22:16.128
Miss Emke paid on time,
always in cash,

22:16.200 --> 22:17.531
and left no forwarding address.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.761
I hope you were more successful.

22:18.840 --> 22:21.161
Unfortunately, no. She was
the perfect New York neighbor.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.526
No one saw or spoke to her.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.809
Half the people I talked to didn't
even know the apartment was rented.

22:25.880 --> 22:27.086
So what next?

22:30.000 --> 22:31.365
- Miss Carter?
- Quiet.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.604
Procedure 791,

22:37.680 --> 22:40.604
isolate the suspect and remove civilians
from harm before attempting arrest.

22:40.680 --> 22:41.966
I'm sorry. What's happening?

22:42.040 --> 22:44.361
The man at the counter is
Agent Messner from Washington, D.C.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.961
The man behind me is Agent Reese.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.087
SSR agents?

22:50.160 --> 22:52.049
I need you to find a way
to block the front door

22:52.120 --> 22:53.884
so that no one else can come in.
I'll do the rest.

22:53.960 --> 22:55.291
I'd love to.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.167
Oh.

22:57.240 --> 23:00.050
Ten cents for a cup of coffee,
who would believe it?

23:02.960 --> 23:04.041
Get her!

23:06.000 --> 23:07.161
Hold it right there!

23:20.120 --> 23:21.326
I can't hold it forever!

23:29.760 --> 23:30.921
That way, Miss Carter!

23:39.000 --> 23:40.206
Stop.

23:41.240 --> 23:42.321
Right there, Carter.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.968
No sudden movements.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.567
Ah.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.250
Those idiots from D.C.
didn't believe me

23:51.320 --> 23:53.004
when I said you'd be hard to grab.

23:53.520 --> 23:54.726
What's happening, Jack?

23:54.800 --> 23:57.121
Witness places you with Brannis
the night he died,

23:57.200 --> 24:00.090
there's a photo of you in the club
the night Spider Raymond was killed,

24:00.160 --> 24:03.562
and here you are with your best friend,
Howard Stark's butler.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.130
I think there's been
a terrible misunderstanding...

24:05.200 --> 24:06.201
Stuff it.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.564
You've got it all wrong.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.130
Then turn yourself in,

24:11.040 --> 24:13.441
come to the office,
and tell me all about it.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.522
You know I can't do that.

24:15.640 --> 24:18.803
Sweetheart, look around.

24:19.720 --> 24:21.006
You don't have a choice.

24:21.480 --> 24:22.891
I'm so sorry, Jack.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.963
The Dublin House, 79th Street.
Meet me there.

24:30.040 --> 24:31.121
Meet you there? Where are you going?

24:31.240 --> 24:32.480
There's something I need to get
from The Griffith.

24:32.560 --> 24:34.642
That's a horrible idea.
It's the first place they'll look for you.

24:34.720 --> 24:37.326
- What could you possibly need?
- Steve's blood.

24:37.400 --> 24:38.686
Go!

24:41.080 --> 24:43.287
Margaret Carter,
you're under arrest for treason,

24:43.360 --> 24:44.725
espionage, and aiding and abetting

24:44.800 --> 24:46.484
public enemy number one,
Howard Stark.

24:46.560 --> 24:50.087
There's more to this, Daniel.
More than you can understand.

24:51.920 --> 24:54.730
From where I'm standing,
it's looking pretty cut and dry.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.208
You're not going to shoot me.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.086
Peggy.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.848
Don't run.

25:06.920 --> 25:08.570
If you run, I'll know it's true.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.290
I'm sorry, Daniel.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.404
What do you mean they lost her?

25:25.480 --> 25:27.687
They said she managed
to take down the extra men.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.081
All of them? All the men?

25:30.160 --> 25:32.003
You're telling me one woman
took out an entire team

25:32.080 --> 25:33.366
of highly trained government agents?

25:33.440 --> 25:34.885
That's what you're telling me?

25:34.960 --> 25:36.007
Listen up!

25:37.200 --> 25:39.362
I need agents at New York Municipal,

25:39.440 --> 25:42.728
Newark Metropolitan,
and Grand Central Station.

25:42.800 --> 25:47.124
I want every bus stop,
train station, dock, airport,

25:47.200 --> 25:50.488
every last trolley wallpapered
with pictures of Peggy Carter.

25:50.560 --> 25:53.564
She is now a fugitive
and will be brought to justice,

25:53.640 --> 25:55.324
or else every last one of you

25:55.400 --> 25:57.721
will be demoted
to grade-school hall monitor.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.723
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

26:04.080 --> 26:06.447
Doc. Sorry, you can't be
out here right now.

26:07.640 --> 26:08.926
Go on.

26:12.880 --> 26:15.850
No offense, but now is not the time
to be wandering around the office.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.285
Everything is all right?

26:17.360 --> 26:19.283
Yeah, everything's just dandy.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.886
I got to go take care of some business
concerning one of my agents.

26:21.960 --> 26:23.007
Anything you might need,

26:23.080 --> 26:25.003
Agent Yauch will take care of,
right? Won't he?

26:25.080 --> 26:26.411
Yes, of course.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.162
Make sure he stays in this room.

26:33.480 --> 26:35.482
So, you want coffee or something?

26:35.560 --> 26:37.403
No, thank you.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.205
So...

26:52.360 --> 26:55.250
You are new here, Agent, to the SSR?

26:55.880 --> 26:57.006
Nope.

26:57.080 --> 26:58.809
Chief just trusts me
with sensitive matters,

26:58.880 --> 27:00.609
like protecting our star witnesses.

27:00.880 --> 27:01.927
Ah.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.889
You must be very proud.

27:04.720 --> 27:06.563
Over the moon.

27:06.720 --> 27:09.485
I just don't
understand how you lost her.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.085
I couldn't exactly outrun her, Jack.

27:11.160 --> 27:13.606
Besides, you're not getting
a medal of valor for your performance.

27:13.680 --> 27:16.490
Unbelievable.
Carter. Did you know?

27:16.560 --> 27:19.040
What the hell do you think, Jack? No.

27:19.960 --> 27:21.769
I mean, I suspected
she was hiding something,

27:21.840 --> 27:23.205
but not this.

27:23.280 --> 27:26.170
- You?
- No. No, I sure didn't.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.163
You said she has a place
at The Griffith, right?

27:28.240 --> 27:29.401
On 63rd, near Lex.

27:29.480 --> 27:32.086
Well, crutch faster. We got places to be.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.570
I got spinach in my teeth or what?

27:36.040 --> 27:37.041
Oh.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.930
No, I am simply, uh, observing.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.162
It's something I do.

27:43.040 --> 27:45.691
You are a middle child, are you not?

27:45.760 --> 27:47.205
How do you figure that?

27:48.720 --> 27:50.802
Many years of experience.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.489
You are eager to please.

27:53.560 --> 27:58.487
You feel you are often ignored,
as if you are invisible.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.927
You got all that just by looking at me?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.287
You should start up a show
with this act.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.761
I merely thought
I might be of assistance.

28:07.120 --> 28:09.088
I will keep my thoughts to myself.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.562
Assistance with what?

28:12.640 --> 28:16.247
Well, Chief Dooley, while a good man,

28:16.320 --> 28:18.402
is also a very busy man, yes?

28:18.480 --> 28:22.644
Quite difficult to get his attention,
prove your worth.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.323
I can help you with that.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.801
Hey, you got any bright ideas,
I'm all ears.

28:28.880 --> 28:31.565
I'm tired of that squid Thompson
pulling all the good cases.

28:31.640 --> 28:34.211
This is because he is confident.

28:35.400 --> 28:36.731
I'm confident.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.131
You can be.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.322
But first, we must focus

28:42.400 --> 28:44.402
on everything you must do

28:44.480 --> 28:50.522
to show Chief Dooley
the best agent he has ever seen.

28:51.320 --> 28:53.687
Simply focus.

29:18.760 --> 29:20.091
What apartment is Peggy Carter in?

29:20.160 --> 29:22.925
Officer, if I gave
every girl's information out

29:23.000 --> 29:25.128
to every Tom, Dick, and Gary
who came in here...

29:25.240 --> 29:26.321
What are you doing?

29:26.400 --> 29:28.164
Get out of there. That's confidential.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.922
- She's in 3E.
- Let's go.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.810
What? Men are not allowed
above the lobby.

29:33.880 --> 29:35.370
It's a safety issue.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.169
I want your badge numbers

29:37.240 --> 29:39.481
and the name
of your immediate supervisor!

29:53.120 --> 29:55.248
- Ma'am, step back.

29:55.320 --> 29:57.322
Let's go, boys. Right around the corner.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.971
Search everywhere, bag everything.
It all comes with us.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.368
Oh! My wall!

30:13.440 --> 30:15.841
I knew she was trouble
the minute I laid eyes on her.

30:15.920 --> 30:19.402
Those girls from the telephone
company are all the same.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.848
She's here somewhere. I know it.

30:24.560 --> 30:26.927
Okay. But where?

31:09.160 --> 31:10.810
Oh, God.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.926
Peggy? What on Earth are you doing?

31:17.000 --> 31:18.206
- Miss Martinelli!

31:18.280 --> 31:20.282
Federal agents!
We have some questions for you.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.125
They're here for me.

31:29.160 --> 31:31.242
Miss Martinelli, open up!

31:33.160 --> 31:35.083
Oh. You don't look like federal agents.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.083
We're with the
Strategic Scientific Reserve.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.891
Well, I'm with the Queens County 4-H.
Now take it down the hall.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.367
I suggest you take them
seriously, Miss Martinelli.

31:42.440 --> 31:45.125
Miss Carter is not
who she appears to be.

31:45.200 --> 31:49.330
She has defaced the very walls
of this institution.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.164
Mother hen here says
you're friends with Peggy Carter.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.765
Yeah, we're friendly.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.080
She ever tell you about her work?

31:54.160 --> 31:56.401
At the phone company?
Just the usual stuff.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.767
Complained about
her fathead male co-workers a lot.

31:58.840 --> 32:01.207
She keep weird hours,
stay out late, bring guys over?

32:01.280 --> 32:02.691
Of course not. Curfew's at 10:00.

32:02.760 --> 32:04.649
- No guys above the lobby.
- Hear, hear.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.245
When was the last time you saw her?

32:07.320 --> 32:08.845
A little bit ago.

32:08.920 --> 32:09.921
She was on her way out,

32:10.000 --> 32:11.684
said she wasn't
gonna be around for a while.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.681
Did she say anything else,
like where she was going?

32:16.240 --> 32:18.163
No. She didn't say.

32:22.280 --> 32:26.683
Uh, but I think it had something to do
with her sick grandmother.

32:30.520 --> 32:31.885
Oh, gee. Um...

32:33.680 --> 32:36.331
Please, don't do that.

32:36.400 --> 32:39.131
It's just that
her grandmother is doing poorly.

32:39.200 --> 32:41.806
And whenever I think about it,
it makes me think of my nana,

32:41.880 --> 32:44.281
who's so supportive
of my acting career.

32:44.360 --> 32:47.489
I perform for her, and she says,
"You belong onstage, angel."

32:47.560 --> 32:49.688
Even though I'm living hand to mouth.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.728
And I just...

32:55.440 --> 32:56.521
Please, stop.

32:56.600 --> 32:57.886
Could you do something here?

32:58.080 --> 33:01.448
Oh, actors wear their emotions
close to the surface.

33:01.520 --> 33:05.161
I could no more stop her
than I could Laurence Olivier.

33:07.120 --> 33:08.929
What's your grandmother's name?

33:10.520 --> 33:11.681
Gam-gam.

33:14.440 --> 33:16.807
Uh, we should go,
talk to some more of the neighbors.

33:16.880 --> 33:17.881
Come on, Thompson.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.365
There, there.

33:27.080 --> 33:30.527
Well, I hope you're happy,
making my tenants cry.

33:30.600 --> 33:34.082
And to think, my taxes
pay for your incompetence.

33:34.160 --> 33:36.242
Take Miss Fry to her office.
Keep her there.

33:36.320 --> 33:38.402
No! Wait! Just a minute!

33:38.480 --> 33:40.369
For your own safety!

33:40.440 --> 33:41.851
My gut says Peggy's close.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.048
All right, then let's find her.

33:44.120 --> 33:45.451
Come here.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.043
I want the entire building canvassed.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.851
If Carter's here,
by God, we're gonna find her.

34:00.640 --> 34:01.687
Oh.

34:01.760 --> 34:03.046
Angie, you're amazing.

34:03.120 --> 34:05.282
I knew you didn't work
at the phone company.

34:08.719 --> 34:12.485
Now, the weapons
that belonged to Howard Stark,

34:13.440 --> 34:15.248
where might I find them?

34:15.920 --> 34:17.809
Here, in the lab.

34:18.320 --> 34:20.641
They took all the Stark tech in there
and locked it up tight.

34:20.719 --> 34:22.290
The eggheads were working on it.

34:22.360 --> 34:25.648
Good. Can you take me there?

34:27.480 --> 34:28.686
Focus.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.687
Can you take me to the lab?

34:34.840 --> 34:36.922
Sorry. I can't.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.400
Dooley found out
Carter was a spy for Stark,

34:39.480 --> 34:41.847
and he put everything on lockdown.

34:42.600 --> 34:45.409
The only person allowed anywhere
near the lab is the Chief.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.041
Hmm.

34:49.760 --> 34:53.047
Can you show me the exits
on the map, please?

34:53.120 --> 34:56.010
I may need to leave quickly.

34:56.440 --> 34:57.805
Here

34:58.560 --> 35:00.642
and here are your best bets.

35:01.360 --> 35:02.771
Thank you.

35:03.400 --> 35:07.007
Now I need your complete focus.

35:07.080 --> 35:09.082
Do I have that?

35:09.160 --> 35:10.605
Yes, sir.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.011
Good.

35:13.680 --> 35:17.890
What I need you to do
is leave this room,

35:17.960 --> 35:20.440
<i>retrieve your belongings,</i>

35:20.520 --> 35:24.206
<i>like you would for the end of your shift.</i>

35:25.880 --> 35:28.804
<i>I need you to go to your favorite bar.</i>

35:30.240 --> 35:34.290
<i>Order a bourbon, only the best.</i>

35:34.400 --> 35:35.561
<i>Top-shelf.</i>

35:36.160 --> 35:38.686
<i>Savor that bourbon.</i>

35:38.760 --> 35:40.410
<i>Enjoy it.</i>

35:41.280 --> 35:43.408
<i>And when you have finished,</i>

35:44.000 --> 35:47.607
<i>I need you to step outside</i>

35:47.680 --> 35:51.446
and do one more thing.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.811
Just got off the phone with my brother.

36:00.880 --> 36:02.689
He's gonna drop a car off
at the Dublin House for you.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.205
Should at least get you
out of town for a while.

36:04.280 --> 36:05.486
Thank you, Angie.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.841
I also told my father
to stuff secretary school.

36:07.920 --> 36:10.082
- I belong on Broadway.
- After the performance I just saw,

36:10.160 --> 36:11.685
there's no way you
should be doing anything else.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.000
You're an amazing actress.

36:13.080 --> 36:14.923
You're not so bad yourself.

36:20.520 --> 36:23.808
Well, I look forward to hearing
what this is about someday.

36:23.880 --> 36:24.961
Someday.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.923
Take care of yourself.

36:28.800 --> 36:30.040
You, too, English.

36:40.360 --> 36:41.885
Peggy?

36:41.960 --> 36:44.088
Oh, gosh, Peggy,
you're a sight for sore eyes.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.969
You know, there's a bunch of
scary men here looking for you?

36:46.040 --> 36:48.247
Hi, Dottie. Sorry. I was
just actually on my way out.

36:48.320 --> 36:50.607
Oh, well, sure, yeah.
Will I see you at dinner tonight?

36:50.680 --> 36:52.967
Not tonight.
I've made other arrangements.

36:53.480 --> 36:56.689
Oh, okay. Well, in that case,
you have a great night, Peg.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.041
Oh. Oh.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.329
You're wearing my brand.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.968
Hey! Is that Peggy Carter?

37:34.040 --> 37:35.929
Miss, for your own safety, stand back!

37:37.160 --> 37:39.049
Oh, gosh, Mister, can you help?

37:39.120 --> 37:41.043
I think my friend Peggy
must have fainted.

37:41.120 --> 37:43.168
- Careful.
- Can you help?

37:46.840 --> 37:47.841
She's out.

37:47.920 --> 37:49.285
What happened?

37:49.360 --> 37:51.169
Oh, I don't know.
I just found her like this.

37:51.240 --> 37:52.765
Jack, a little help?

37:54.960 --> 37:56.291
Sit her up.

37:58.880 --> 38:00.882
She's unconscious.
Do we really need those?

38:01.840 --> 38:03.683
Trust me. We need them.

38:03.800 --> 38:06.690
Oh, gosh, I hope she's okay.
Should I call an ambulance?

38:06.760 --> 38:08.524
Thank you, miss.
We'll take care of it from here.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.247
Grab her pocketbook.

38:13.040 --> 38:15.042
Come on, Carter. Let's go.

39:13.440 --> 39:16.171
I can explain everything. All of it.

39:24.120 --> 39:26.964
Hey, Dot, Miriam wants
everyone downstairs.

39:29.440 --> 39:31.442
I don't got all night, Iowa.

39:31.520 --> 39:32.965
Let's go.

39:37.520 --> 39:39.648
Hey, Dot, you here?

40:09.960 --> 40:11.246
Sit.

40:14.960 --> 40:16.405
This isn't necessary.

40:16.480 --> 40:19.086
You put three SSR agents
in the hospital today,

40:19.160 --> 40:20.924
so, yeah, it's necessary.

40:33.720 --> 40:36.007
Don't go easy on her
just 'cause she's a girl.

40:44.360 --> 40:45.646
Let's get started.
