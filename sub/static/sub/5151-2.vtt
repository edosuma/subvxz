Robe, you scared me to death.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.650
Sorry, are you ready to go?

02:15.800 --> 02:17.723
My dad's taking me.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.689
It's three blocks away.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.241
I'll see you at school.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.523
Yeah, that was Robe outside.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.728
He's such a sweetheart.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.769
I'm so glad
he's gonna be there.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.167
I can't believe
we're doing this.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.085
My dad would kill me
if he found out.

- Oh, hang on.

02:38.160 --> 02:40.447
Um-- uh, hold on.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.409
Okay, come in.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.609
Hey, kiddo.
Got a sec?

02:45.760 --> 02:47.444
Um, yeah.

02:47.640 --> 02:50.211
Hey, I gotta go, Jamie.
Yeah, I'll see you at school.

02:50.360 --> 02:51.930
( Hangs UP )

02:52.080 --> 02:55.687
That's a lot of clothes
for one weekend.

02:55.840 --> 02:56.841
It's my first sleepover.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.082
I figure better
safe than sorry, right?

02:59.280 --> 03:01.806
I haven't seen you this excited
in a long time.

03:01.960 --> 03:05.123
I'm just nervous, I guess.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.491
I don't have to go.
I can call Jamie back right now.

03:11.640 --> 03:14.849
No. We gotta stop
burning that candle.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.527
Laurie is cut from the same
cloth as your mother.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.206
"Born to wander,"
your grandfather used to say.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.203
And I knew that
as soon as she fell

03:23.360 --> 03:25.408
for these long-haired
free-loving types,

03:25.600 --> 03:27.648
she already had one foot
out the door.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.848
Now, if she comes home, great.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.890
It'll be open arms
and Thanksgiving dinners.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.407
But you gotta worry
about you, too.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.881
So you're going to this dance,

03:38.040 --> 03:39.041
and you're gonna go
spend the weekend

03:39.200 --> 03:41.726
with Jamie like you planned.

03:41.880 --> 03:42.927
But you'll be all alone.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.570
Don't you worry about me.

03:44.720 --> 03:49.089
This weekend,
just be 17, okay?

03:49.240 --> 03:50.321
Okay.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.084
All right.

03:54.440 --> 03:57.091
Did you come in here
just to give me a pep talk?

03:57.240 --> 03:58.730
Pretty much.

04:00.920 --> 04:02.410
I'll see you downstairs.

04:19.079 --> 04:21.447
Goddamn vandal.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.365
You may not
respect authority, son,

04:24.520 --> 04:26.329
but while you're on my campus,

04:26.480 --> 04:28.289
you will respect the institution

04:28.440 --> 04:31.205
placed here by
the good people of Michigan.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.761
Let's go find the janitor.

04:46.440 --> 04:47.646
Father:
You look beautiful.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.007
You're just saying that
because you're my dad.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.288
No, I'm saying that
'cause it's the truth.

04:52.440 --> 04:55.967
Now get out of the car.

04:56.120 --> 04:58.726
I will be home Sunday
before "60 Minutes."

04:58.880 --> 05:00.723
Yeah, get out of here.

05:17.240 --> 05:18.924
Jamie.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.801
Look at that dress.
You look amazing.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.007
Shut up, you do.

05:26.160 --> 05:30.006
I've never done this before.
Sneaking out? Lying to my dad?

05:30.160 --> 05:31.321
Ever since Laurie left, I--

05:31.480 --> 05:34.450
Uh-uh. We are not telling
sad stories this weekend.

05:34.640 --> 05:35.766
Happy thoughts.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.048
Right. Happy thoughts.

05:38.200 --> 05:42.091
Sean and Adrienne
sitting in a tree.

05:42.240 --> 05:45.005
- K-l-S-S--
- Stop!

05:45.160 --> 05:46.491
We just flirted.

05:46.640 --> 05:47.880
He probably does it
with everyone.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.964
Not this weekend, he doesn't.

05:51.160 --> 05:54.926
- I gotta go grab my bag.
- Okay, I'll meet you outside.

05:57.240 --> 06:00.289
I'm gonna get you laid.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.564
Okay, coast is clear.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.842
Man, I cannot believe
I let y'all talk me into this.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.729
What else were you gonna be
doing this weekend, huh?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.405
Wasn't gonna be committing
a felony, I know that.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.607
What do you think, Robe?

06:23.760 --> 06:24.807
I'm you're asking me
if I can get it started,

06:24.960 --> 06:26.007
the answer's hell, yeah!

06:26.160 --> 06:27.400
All right, dude.
Come on.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.166
One, two, three.
Go. Go!

06:32.600 --> 06:34.523
Get your big ass
in there, man.

06:34.680 --> 06:35.727
Quit shoving, all right?

06:35.880 --> 06:36.881
Hey, man, it's all fun and games

06:37.080 --> 06:38.764
until someone loses an eye,
all right?

06:38.960 --> 06:40.689
Grab the bags.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.249
Don't you walk away from me,
young lady!

06:51.400 --> 06:52.765
I didn't do anything!

06:52.920 --> 06:54.649
Maybe not yet, but you shouldn't
be hanging around

06:54.800 --> 06:55.847
with those boys.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.401
And that outfit is unacceptable.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.771
What are you doing out here?

07:05.920 --> 07:08.082
The dance is inside.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.567
What's the matter
with what I'm wearing?

07:10.720 --> 07:12.609
Gotta get with the times, Mr. C.

07:12.760 --> 07:16.970
Mr. C: This isn't the same world
your parents grew up in.

07:17.160 --> 07:18.889
You carry mace?

07:20.840 --> 07:24.128
A.B.P., that's my motto.
Always be prepared.

07:24.280 --> 07:26.123
When I was in the bush
with the 101st,

07:26.280 --> 07:27.361
you can sure bet,
little missile,

07:27.520 --> 07:29.204
that we were prepared
for anything.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.089
'Cause that was back in the day
when men were men

07:31.240 --> 07:32.401
and women knew it.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.649
Don't look at me with those
big dumb cow eyes.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.530
Get right in there.
Get right in there.

07:42.680 --> 07:45.445
- All right. How's that?
- Good.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.090
Hey, man, I thought you said
you could start this thing.

07:47.240 --> 07:48.924
I built a working ham radio
when I was 10.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.241
I think I can start a bus.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.209
I don't see how those two things
are related at all.

07:52.360 --> 07:53.646
Hey, man,
if you get this thing started,

07:53.800 --> 07:55.325
I'll even talk
to Marilyn for you.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.244
I've talked to Marilyn
a million times, okay?

07:57.400 --> 08:00.563
Homeboy, I'm talking
about talking, all right?

08:00.720 --> 08:02.051
The kind you do without words?

08:02.200 --> 08:04.965
Hot, wet, filthy conversation.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.849
Shut up and let me work, okay?
Come on.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.328
( Engine sputters )

08:10.480 --> 08:11.845
Come on.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.570
- ( Engine starts )
- Yes!

08:13.760 --> 08:15.842
- That's what I'm talking about!
- All right, here we go.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.490
- Shoo!
- Buckle up!

08:19.840 --> 08:21.763
She's wearing what?

08:21.920 --> 08:23.729
Speak of the slut,
and she will appear.

08:24.840 --> 08:26.205
Seen Johnnie?

08:26.400 --> 08:27.640
Not yet.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.006
The boys should be here
any minute, though.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.685
Maybe he's with Sean.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.206
That's a cute dress.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.645
It almost looks like
you have boobs.

08:34.799 --> 08:37.530
Thanks.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.568
Is she for real?

08:39.720 --> 08:41.688
She's clueless.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.205
You seen Marilyn?

08:43.360 --> 08:44.850
Marilyn will be here
in a minute.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.884
She got cornered by Mr. C.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.531
Did you hear that?

08:51.680 --> 08:54.524
- Hear what?
- I just want to see what it is.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.371
Psych!

09:02.840 --> 09:04.968
Oh, you should have seen
your stupid faces.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.565
- Real nice, Johnnie.
- Hi, baby.

09:09.880 --> 09:12.201
( Bus approaching )

09:12.400 --> 09:15.290
- Johnnie: All right. Wheels.
- Jamie: No way.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.522
Adrienne:
Come on, Jamie.

09:23.680 --> 09:26.251
All right, whew! Shoo!

09:26.400 --> 09:28.482
Boom!
He got us a ride.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.006
- Not bad.
- As if.

09:33.160 --> 09:35.322
Adrienne, your chariot awaits,
my lady.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.403
Whoa, hold on.

09:37.560 --> 09:40.370
You did bring the key,
right, scholarship?

09:40.520 --> 09:41.646
And you made arrangements?

09:41.800 --> 09:42.847
No overprotective daddy

09:43.000 --> 09:44.161
is gonna come
looking for us, right?

09:44.320 --> 09:45.526
Yeah, it's all set.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.889
You just made
the cool kids' table.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.610
So you ready
to break some rules?

09:50.760 --> 09:54.003
Sure, I-- I mean, yeah.
Let's break some rules.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.969
( laughs )

09:56.120 --> 09:57.201
Who's missing?

09:57.360 --> 09:58.930
Marilyn:
Guys, I'm here!

09:59.080 --> 10:00.127
Okay, let's get out of here

10:00.280 --> 10:02.851
before Mr. C. realizes
we're not inside.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.571
Getting all
Big Brother in there.

10:05.720 --> 10:07.131
- Hey, Marilyn.
- Hey, man.

10:09.440 --> 10:10.487
Something wrong?

10:10.640 --> 10:12.608
What if someone notices
the bus is missing?

10:13.800 --> 10:15.290
Johnnie's dad practically
owns this town, okay?

10:15.440 --> 10:16.930
Nobody's gonna press charges.

10:18.560 --> 10:21.006
Hey, would I let anything
happen to you?

10:21.160 --> 10:22.969
No.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.929
That's my girl.
Come on.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.286

10:44.480 --> 10:47.131
Goddamn turds went AWOL.

who they're messing with.

What you mean?

14:10.680 --> 14:12.364
We are so screwed.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.363
Fuck.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.328
Yep. Dry as a bone.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.050
It's a gas thing.
The engine looks fine.

14:21.240 --> 14:22.969
We're out of gas?

14:23.120 --> 14:24.610
You mean to tell me
we're stuck out here, Robe?

14:24.800 --> 14:27.246
Wes! Wes, hey, it's fine, man.
We're gonna be okay.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.448
Don't look at me, okay?
The gauge says half full.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.443
You guys picked the broken bus.
I just started it.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.722
Hey, guys?

14:33.880 --> 14:36.121
Where are the girls?

14:36.280 --> 14:38.886
Jamie:
Sean is so into you.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.088
Told you I was
gonna get you laid.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.890
Adrienne:
I don't know, maybe.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.566
I mean, I don't really know
how to kiss,

14:45.720 --> 14:47.245
let alone, you know.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.243
You don't know
what you're missing out on.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.801
- Don't be silly, it's easy.
- And rad.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.327
- Here, I'll show you.
- No!

14:54.480 --> 14:56.801
Do it. Then when Sean
kisses you, it won't be weird.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.843
It's weird now.

14:59.040 --> 15:02.567
Jamie's not afraid to do it.
Are you, Jamie?

15:02.720 --> 15:03.960
Watch and learn.

15:06.360 --> 15:07.566
Just close your eyes.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.649
Open your mouth,
but just a bit.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.729
Then you tilt your head
and wait for it.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.564
See? Easy.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.802
You guys are crazy.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.769
( Can rattles )

15:30.920 --> 15:32.410
Oh, my God!

15:32.560 --> 15:33.891
Ha ha!

15:34.040 --> 15:36.122
- Johnnie, you scumbag!
- Nice tits!

15:36.280 --> 15:38.169
Get a life, will you?

15:38.320 --> 15:40.527
You don't think he saw
anything, do you?

15:40.680 --> 15:43.047
(laughing)

15:44.040 --> 15:45.451
Why would he do that?

15:45.600 --> 15:47.045
Because it's Johnnie.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.286
( laughs and grunts )

15:53.440 --> 15:55.363
Man, I saw the girls changing.

15:55.520 --> 15:56.965
I scared the shit out of them.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.645
Got to love the classics.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.485
You dickheads
get this thing rolling yet?

16:01.640 --> 16:03.483
Can't go anywhere
until we find some gas.

16:03.640 --> 16:05.927
Well, that's Robe’s
department, right?

16:06.080 --> 16:09.971
You broke the bus,
you fix the bus.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.565
Come on, dude.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.326
Much better.

16:15.480 --> 16:17.005
Those heels were killing me.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.726
Man, I got a mosquito bite
on my ass.

16:21.640 --> 16:22.721
You look great.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.211
Thanks.

16:24.360 --> 16:25.646
How very.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.526
Hey, Sean, get in the game.
What are we doing?

16:32.320 --> 16:33.481
How far away are we
from your cabin?

16:33.680 --> 16:35.364
I don't know.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.000
I guess they'll give anyone
a scholarship, huh?

16:38.160 --> 16:39.491
Get bent, Johnnie.

16:39.680 --> 16:41.170
Look, maybe we can send
somebody down the road

16:41.320 --> 16:42.321
and see if there's
anything nearby.

16:42.520 --> 16:43.567
Yeah, good idea.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.051
Hey, thanks for volunteering.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.645
What? Why me?

16:46.800 --> 16:48.529
Don't you know?

16:48.680 --> 16:51.524
The driver's always responsible
for the passenger, Robe.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.967
Unless you're too much
of a pussy to go.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.043
This is so bogus.
All by myself?

16:56.240 --> 16:58.129
I'll go.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.850
Really?

17:01.880 --> 17:04.359
Hey, there you go.
Hit the road, loser.

17:04.520 --> 17:05.521
Gimme the flashlight.

17:05.680 --> 17:06.806
May the Force
be with you, pal.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.923
( As Yoda)
Find help, I will.

17:14.040 --> 17:16.167
Man, we are gonna be here
the whole night.

17:16.319 --> 17:18.402
Johnnie: Why is everybody
being so paranoid?

17:18.560 --> 17:21.848
There are houses everywhere.
This is America, okay?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.569
Tubby will find a phone
and a rack of ribs

17:23.720 --> 17:24.881
and be back in a flash.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.041
You know, maybe
we can get all the bags out

17:27.200 --> 17:28.884
and see what we got
all the same.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.407
( Twig snaps )

17:31.560 --> 17:32.891
What?

17:36.040 --> 17:37.530
Nothing.

17:37.680 --> 17:40.047
Just thought I heard something.

17:40.240 --> 17:42.686
Why do you think Marilyn went
with lard-ass anyway?

17:42.840 --> 17:44.365
Really?

17:44.520 --> 17:46.761
It's 'cause Robe
has all the weed.

17:46.960 --> 17:49.361
So... got any weed?

17:49.520 --> 17:51.727
You know it.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.841
- Sorry. ( coughs )
- Lightweight.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.924
No, I mean I'm sorry
I got us into all this.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.128
Robe, chill.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.089
Shit happens. It's fate.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.447
What?

18:12.600 --> 18:14.090
Fate, you know,

18:14.280 --> 18:16.362
like, the way things
are supposed to go down.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.090
I believe everything
happens for a reason,

18:18.280 --> 18:20.089
even if we don't know
what it is.

18:20.280 --> 18:21.361
Like us talking right now.

18:21.520 --> 18:22.567
I mean, if hadn't decided

18:22.720 --> 18:24.165
to go to the cabin
for the weekend,

18:24.320 --> 18:26.084
or if we hadn't picked
that particular bus

18:26.240 --> 18:27.287
with the broken gauge,

18:27.440 --> 18:30.444
or if we hadn't run out of gas
on that particular road,

18:30.600 --> 18:32.602
we wouldn't even be having
this conversation.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.443
You know, I'm really happy
we have Sociology together.

18:38.600 --> 18:41.649
One class,
our last year and all.

18:41.800 --> 18:42.961
Me, too.

18:45.040 --> 18:48.601
Remember that time Miss Williams
handed us those worksheets

18:48.760 --> 18:50.967
and when she handed you yours

18:51.120 --> 18:52.963
she asked you what was wrong
'cause your eyes were so red?

18:53.120 --> 18:55.805
- Yeah.
- And you said

18:55.960 --> 18:59.203
you were way too high
to be doing a worksheet.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.328
That was hilarious.

19:01.480 --> 19:03.608
And she said something else,
but I didn't hear.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.922
She said-- she told me
to put my head down

19:06.120 --> 19:08.009
and not talk to anybody
for the rest of the class.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.367
I think she thought
it was contagious.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.087
That was the first time I knew
you were cool.

19:15.240 --> 19:17.129
Cool like I smoke grass?

19:17.280 --> 19:20.284
No. You know...

19:20.440 --> 19:23.330
a cool guy.

19:23.480 --> 19:24.845
Really?

19:25.000 --> 19:27.970
Absolutely.

19:30.040 --> 19:31.769
Okay.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.810
Box of Bugles,
box of Pop Tarts,

19:34.960 --> 19:36.121
and some gum.

19:36.320 --> 19:37.481
That's it?

19:37.640 --> 19:40.041
Can we stop worrying
and start drinking again?

19:40.240 --> 19:42.049
The beer's getting warmer
by the minute.

19:46.840 --> 19:47.841
Hey, Heather,
you got anything to eat

19:48.040 --> 19:49.201
in the big-ass bag of yours?

19:49.360 --> 19:51.362
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

19:51.520 --> 19:53.329
Not even some Twinkies
or something?

19:53.480 --> 19:55.881
You see, Heather here,
she's a Twinkies junkie.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.520
Shut up! Am not.

20:01.520 --> 20:02.521
Let me see.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.200
No, I just have personal items.
You know, girl things.

20:05.360 --> 20:06.361
Great, let me see.

20:06.520 --> 20:07.726
- Johnnie, no!
- ( dog barks )

20:07.880 --> 20:08.881
What the fuck?

20:09.040 --> 20:10.963
Precious, are you okay?

20:11.120 --> 20:12.167
I can't believe it.

20:12.320 --> 20:13.731
You brought your
rat-fucking dog?

20:13.880 --> 20:15.405
I knew you wouldn't let me
bring her if I told you.

20:15.560 --> 20:18.564
Look, the dog's here now,
okay, Johnnie?

20:18.720 --> 20:20.722
You know what?
Scholarship here is right.

20:20.880 --> 20:22.769
There's nothing we can do now.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.729
Eat it, maybe.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.769
And you wonder
why she hates you.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.410
It's okay, baby.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.210
I won't let the bad man
hurt you.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.885
What about you, Johnnie?

20:34.400 --> 20:35.811
Do cigarettes count?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.082
How many calories
are in a cigarette?

20:39.240 --> 20:42.084
Look, I bet Robe and Marilyn
already found help

20:42.240 --> 20:44.208
and are on their way back.

20:44.360 --> 20:47.250
Got another joint?

20:47.400 --> 20:49.243
Madame?

20:49.400 --> 20:51.084
Mercia.

20:57.560 --> 21:00.040
This bud is gnarly.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.565
The gnarliest.

21:05.360 --> 21:06.441
How far do you think
we've gone?

21:06.600 --> 21:09.524
Who cares?
We're on vacation.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.125
Yeah, life's a beach.

21:13.120 --> 21:15.202
- What are you doing?
- Oh! He's ticklish!

21:15.360 --> 21:16.441
No, okay, no.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.364
You can run,
but you can't hide!

21:18.520 --> 21:21.091
- ( Clang )
- Damn it.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.446
What was that?

21:24.040 --> 21:25.087
Cool.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.810
"Joan."

21:29.120 --> 21:31.282
Marilyn:
It's a house.

21:31.440 --> 21:32.930
Let's go tell everyone.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.127
Oh, whoa, whoa, wait.

21:34.280 --> 21:35.486
I mean, who knows
who could live there?

21:35.640 --> 21:36.641
I mean, look at that place.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.280
No one lives there.
It's a dump.

21:39.480 --> 21:41.642
Kind of spooky, huh?

21:41.800 --> 21:44.371
I think we've gone past spooky
and straight to freaky.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.522
Come on,
let's go tell the others.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.163
Come on.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.651
Hey, don't make me
tickle you again.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.450
Robe: Okay, no,
you stay right over there.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.001
( Marilyn shouts )

21:56.160 --> 21:58.003
Marilyn:
I'm coming after you!

22:01.480 --> 22:04.051
( Disco music playing )

22:14.840 --> 22:19.528
( cartoon music playing )

22:44.040 --> 22:46.042
- ( knock on door)
- All right already!

22:46.200 --> 22:47.531
Hold your horses!

22:58.040 --> 23:01.886
Vice principal
Frank Cunningham.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.725
We have a serious situation
on our hands.

23:04.880 --> 23:07.565
- ( Can pops )
- ( pop music playing )

23:09.240 --> 23:10.730
Wes:
Now's your chance, bro.

23:13.600 --> 23:14.761
<i>He'! '</i>

23:17.320 --> 23:18.606
Everything okay?

23:18.760 --> 23:20.410
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah?

23:20.560 --> 23:23.530
You just seem quiet back here.

23:23.680 --> 23:25.409
I'm sorry.

23:28.680 --> 23:30.364
What's wrong?

23:30.520 --> 23:32.568
- Be honest with me.
- Okay.

23:32.760 --> 23:35.240
If my dad didn't have
this hunting cabin,

23:35.400 --> 23:37.880
would you guys
have wanted me along?

23:38.040 --> 23:39.087
Adrienne, look--

23:39.240 --> 23:41.607
Sean,
if I hadn't been your tutor

23:41.760 --> 23:44.411
and told you about the cabin,
would I even be here?

23:44.560 --> 23:45.925
Look, Adrienne...

23:48.120 --> 23:49.406
I think you're beautiful.

23:49.560 --> 23:53.451
Okay, the cabin was just
some excuse

23:53.600 --> 23:55.728
to spend time with you.

23:56.920 --> 23:59.287
Really? Beautiful?

23:59.440 --> 24:02.967
Yeah. Thought so ever since
we had homeroom together.

24:06.960 --> 24:08.849
I mean, it's like you got
this whole other gear.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.048
First you're in the semis.
Couldn't nobody touch you.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.441
And then you sprain your ankle
and still ran in the finals?

24:13.600 --> 24:15.443
That's bad-ass, girl.

24:15.640 --> 24:18.564
It's a breathing thing.

24:18.720 --> 24:21.803
I mean, the pain
just kind of fades away

24:21.960 --> 24:23.246
if you focus on your breath.

24:23.440 --> 24:25.010
Yeah.

24:25.160 --> 24:27.288
I tell you what I've been
focusing on.

24:28.640 --> 24:29.641
Here it comes.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.121
No, come on. Look,
don't be so quick to judge.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.322
I was just gonna say
that maybe you and I

24:34.480 --> 24:35.527
could find some time to
ourselves

24:35.680 --> 24:36.727
once we get into the cabin.

24:36.880 --> 24:39.804
- Me and you.
- Yeah, why not?

24:41.320 --> 24:43.322
Word gets around, Wes.

24:43.480 --> 24:46.245
Rumor is you're
a little bit of a dog.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.005
Aw, come on.

24:49.160 --> 24:51.447
That hurt. Really.

24:52.640 --> 24:54.802
Focus on the breathing.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.006
(thud)

24:58.440 --> 24:59.646
Hey, look.

25:00.680 --> 25:01.966
What is it?

25:02.120 --> 25:04.885
Someone's there.

25:05.040 --> 25:07.168
Where?
I don't see anything.

25:07.320 --> 25:08.526
Heather:
Outside.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.731
Listen.
You hear that?

25:12.880 --> 25:16.362
- ( Music continues )
- ( faint scraping )

25:18.920 --> 25:20.365
Kill-- kill the music.

25:21.840 --> 25:24.047
- ( Music stops )
- ( scraping continues )

25:29.520 --> 25:31.204
- Johnnie, I'm scar--
- Quiet!

25:32.880 --> 25:37.886
( Scraping continues )

25:45.720 --> 25:48.724
( scraping continues )

26:03.400 --> 26:06.324
( scraping continues )

26:12.480 --> 26:13.561
- Sean.
- Yeah.

26:13.720 --> 26:15.085
Come on.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.406
Aah!

26:38.560 --> 26:40.244
( Robe and Marilyn laughing )

26:46.440 --> 26:48.602
I think we found something.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.125
( No audible dialogue )

26:50.280 --> 26:51.770
( knuckles crack)

26:53.160 --> 26:56.130
These eyes don't lie.

26:56.280 --> 26:58.806
She was on the bus
with those miscreants.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.962
Well, let's get to the bottom
of this right now.

27:13.160 --> 27:16.482
Hi, Rhonda. This is Norman,
Adrienne's father.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.802
huh
- Rhonda: ls everything okay?

27:21.560 --> 27:23.801
Why would Jamie be here?
I didn't-- I thought--

27:23.960 --> 27:25.007
Rhonda:
Jamie was supposed to be

27:25.200 --> 27:26.247
sleeping over there
this weekend.

27:26.400 --> 27:29.370
Never mind what I thought.
I'll call you back.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.005
Frank:
She'll be fine.

27:36.160 --> 27:38.640
What I don't know
is where they might be going.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.330
I swear to you, Mr. Cunningham,

27:40.480 --> 27:42.687
she didn't tell me
anything about this.

27:42.840 --> 27:44.729
I'm sure she did not.

27:44.880 --> 27:45.927
I don't understand.

27:46.080 --> 27:47.730
She usually makes
such good choices.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.689
It's a shame that a student

27:49.840 --> 27:52.844
that shows as much
promise as Adrienne

27:53.000 --> 27:54.764
would associate
with these hooligans.

27:54.920 --> 27:57.048
Mr. Cunningham,
she needs this school.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.565
It would be unfortunate
if she did anything

27:58.720 --> 28:01.200
to jeopardize that.

28:01.360 --> 28:03.601
Could be disastrous
for her future.

28:03.760 --> 28:06.127
I need some coffee.

28:07.840 --> 28:11.367
What do you say
we Irish that up a little?

28:11.520 --> 28:12.931
Sounds good.

28:24.360 --> 28:26.203
I think I know where they went.

28:26.360 --> 28:28.567
What are the coordinates?

28:45.160 --> 28:47.561
Johnnie: You don't think anybody
lives in this shithole, do you?

28:47.720 --> 28:50.564
Sean: Maybe a squatter
or something.

28:50.720 --> 28:51.926
Who knows out here?

28:52.120 --> 28:54.361
Johnnie:
Only way to find out.

28:56.240 --> 29:00.404
Wes: Hey, guys?
I'm not too sure about this.

29:00.560 --> 29:02.688
Marilyn:
You scared?

29:07.320 --> 29:09.129
Johnnie: Hello?

29:09.280 --> 29:10.964
Hello, anyone home?

29:13.120 --> 29:15.521
See? No problem.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.808
- ( Thud )
<i>_</i> ( laughter)

29:17.960 --> 29:19.405
Heather:
Baby, are you okay?

29:19.560 --> 29:21.608
- Johnnie: I'm fine.
- Heather: Shut up!

29:21.760 --> 29:23.330
Johnnie:
Fucking house is a death trap.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.806
Hello?

29:29.960 --> 29:31.883
( Snaps fingers )
Flashlight.

29:46.520 --> 29:49.000
This place is so goody.

29:49.160 --> 29:52.130
It's like "Better Hillbilly
Homes and Gardens."

29:52.280 --> 29:54.328
( chuckles )

29:54.520 --> 29:55.806
I don't know.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.281
Some fresh curtains,
new coat of paint,

29:58.480 --> 29:59.641
and it would be...

29:59.800 --> 30:02.690
really just awful.

30:03.960 --> 30:05.121
Electricity's out.

30:38.680 --> 30:39.886
( Heather screams )

30:40.040 --> 30:41.769
Relax, okay? It's dead.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.206
Get it out of here!

30:43.400 --> 30:45.004
What do you think did that?

30:45.160 --> 30:46.446
A possum, maybe?

30:46.600 --> 30:48.409
Oh, my God,
there are possums here?

30:48.560 --> 30:52.770
I think we can rule out
the possum theory.

30:52.920 --> 30:55.810
I don't know, maybe just
a drifter just passing through?

30:55.960 --> 30:57.291
Now you're Sherlock Holmes?

30:57.440 --> 30:58.851
( Chuckles )
Good one, baby.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.520
Either way, doesn't look like
anyone's actually lived here

31:01.680 --> 31:02.761
in a long time.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.041
I mean, my guess
is we're alone,

31:04.200 --> 31:05.531
but maybe we should
stay in pairs, you know?

31:05.680 --> 31:07.523
This place is big.

31:07.680 --> 31:09.444
- Creepy, too.
- Yeah.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.523
Ugh.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.042
There.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.009
Okay.

31:18.160 --> 31:19.525
Let's see if there's anything
we can scrounge up.

31:19.680 --> 31:21.842
I mean, phone's probably
too much to ask,

31:22.000 --> 31:23.843
but maybe some candles
or a flashlight?

31:24.000 --> 31:25.729
Johnnie:
Let's split up and look around.

31:25.880 --> 31:27.644
Me and Heather
will check the bedrooms.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.680
( Clicks flashlight on )
Mm.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.046
( British accent)
Perhaps you'll find

31:32.240 --> 31:33.480
Heather's lost virginity.

31:33.640 --> 31:36.371
( laughter)

31:36.520 --> 31:39.569
You know I could
literally crush you... right?

31:41.760 --> 31:43.569
Johnnie, easy.

31:43.720 --> 31:45.563
Okay, Wes, Jamie,
see if you can salvage anything

31:45.720 --> 31:46.721
in those last two rooms.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.922
Adrienne, you and I
will check the kitchen.

31:49.080 --> 31:50.730
What about me and Marilyn?

31:50.880 --> 31:54.043
Well, I mean, someone has
to take a look in the barn,

31:54.200 --> 31:56.089
and you're the only one
with the other flashlight.

31:57.400 --> 31:58.606
I think I saw I tractor
on the way up.

31:58.760 --> 32:00.285
Maybe there's
some gas up there.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.482
Sure.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.404
Yeah. Okay.
I guess that's cool.

32:04.560 --> 32:07.166
Okay. All right.
Let's go.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.609
Johnnie: Ugh.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.448
How long do you think it's been
since someone lived here?

32:24.600 --> 32:26.602
Ugh, how should I know?

32:26.760 --> 32:30.082
Sorry, was just trying
to make conversation.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.971
All right, you guys take left.
We'll take right.

32:42.360 --> 32:43.691
( Lighter clicks )

32:57.040 --> 32:58.485
Jamie:
Oh, gross.

33:01.320 --> 33:02.765
Wes: I know,
it's disgusting in here.

33:02.920 --> 33:05.002
( Insects buzzing )

33:05.160 --> 33:07.162
Oh, shit.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.641
Fuck.
Come on.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.922
I saw you looking at her.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.366
What?

33:16.520 --> 33:19.000
Marilyn.
The slut.

33:19.160 --> 33:21.401
Yeah, okay,
I noticed her, babe.

33:21.600 --> 33:25.321
But... you're my girl.
You know?

33:25.520 --> 33:28.171
Why are you always
so mean to me?

33:28.360 --> 33:32.001
I don't know.

33:32.160 --> 33:34.128
But you're right.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.405
I'll try and be better.

33:41.360 --> 33:42.771
Come on.

33:53.680 --> 33:54.920
Jackpot

33:55.080 --> 33:57.811
Oh, you saved the day.
( chuckles )

34:18.320 --> 34:19.685
Watch your step.

34:35.760 --> 34:38.570
Holy shit.
Look at this place.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.686
Marilyn:
Must have been a slaughterhouse.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.888
Just when you think this place
can't get anymore charming,

34:46.040 --> 34:48.202
boom, an abattoir.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.123
Abattoir?

34:50.280 --> 34:52.442
- Slaughterhouse.
- Oh.

34:58.600 --> 35:00.364
So, other barn?

35:00.520 --> 35:02.602
Definitely.
Other barn.

35:55.720 --> 35:59.088
Man, what do you think
this is all about?

35:59.240 --> 36:02.801
I have no clue.
( groans )

36:10.000 --> 36:11.047
( screams )

36:11.200 --> 36:12.884
( laughs )

36:14.000 --> 36:15.525
Good thing I was here.

36:15.680 --> 36:16.727
Yeah.

36:16.880 --> 36:19.008
Just caught me off-guard,
that's all.

36:19.160 --> 36:21.162
Let's get up out of here.

36:21.360 --> 36:22.521
Come on.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.046
<i>He'! '</i>

36:38.960 --> 36:40.883
That's what I'm talking about.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.042
Car equals gas.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.006
Bingo.

36:56.720 --> 36:58.165
And it's empty.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.404
But fear not.

37:02.560 --> 37:04.801
I have something
for our dynamic duo.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.201
My hero.

37:07.360 --> 37:08.964
Do you want a cigarette?

37:09.160 --> 37:11.891
( Chuckles )
No, thanks.

37:12.080 --> 37:14.082
That stuff's poison.

37:28.920 --> 37:30.331
What have we got here, huh?

37:38.680 --> 37:41.047
- Fancy.
- Sweet.

37:41.200 --> 37:43.168
Like, I know...

37:44.440 --> 37:48.081
I know this isn't
the time or place, but...

37:50.280 --> 37:51.964
I really like you.

37:52.160 --> 37:54.162
I like you, too.

37:54.320 --> 37:55.481
Yeah?

38:02.240 --> 38:03.605
That was nice.

38:03.800 --> 38:05.290
Yeah, it was.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.885
( Distant scraping )

38:19.280 --> 38:21.009
- What was that?
- I don't know.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.083
Must have come
from downstairs. Here.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.563
Oh.
Presto.

38:38.040 --> 38:40.520
Oh, well, it's very rustic.

38:40.680 --> 38:42.887
I don't like it.
Can you please close it?

38:43.040 --> 38:45.008
Oh, come on,
there's nothing to be scared of.

38:45.160 --> 38:46.650
Here, look for yourself.

38:46.840 --> 38:48.365
It's okay.

39:00.680 --> 39:03.251
See?
No boogeyman.

39:18.680 --> 39:21.331
( Floorboards creak)

39:33.280 --> 39:35.487
Ugh.

39:35.680 --> 39:37.091
Now that's shitty.

39:42.760 --> 39:45.331
Not exactly the vacation
we had in mind.

39:56.800 --> 40:00.566
So I guess you're probably going
off to college in the fall?

40:00.720 --> 40:04.122
Not sure yet.
What about you?

40:04.280 --> 40:06.806
I'll probably just end up
working for my dad.

40:06.960 --> 40:09.884
But, you know, if you don't go,
it means we could, uh,

40:10.040 --> 40:11.451
you know, hang out more.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.204
( Chuckles softly )

40:13.360 --> 40:15.727
We hang out almost
every weekend at the arcade.

40:15.880 --> 40:17.405
No, I know, we, uh--

40:17.600 --> 40:19.921
we do, but it's, um--

40:20.080 --> 40:21.161
we're always with the gang,
you know.

40:21.320 --> 40:24.164
It's never--
it's never just us.

40:25.760 --> 40:28.161
I can't understand
how someone who smokes

40:28.360 --> 40:31.250
as much weed as you do
can have bad eyes.

40:31.400 --> 40:34.927
I mean, isn't this supposed to
be good for you or something?

40:35.120 --> 40:36.565
Like carrots?
( laughs )

40:36.720 --> 40:38.609
I don't know.
I guess.

40:40.200 --> 40:41.884
No, what I meant was,
you know,

40:42.080 --> 40:43.525
maybe this weekend
will give us a chance

40:43.680 --> 40:45.170
to spend some real time
together, you know?

40:45.320 --> 40:46.685
Just you and me.

40:48.520 --> 40:50.284
- That'd be great.
- Really? You think?

40:50.440 --> 40:51.601
Sure.

40:52.840 --> 40:55.366
I have to warn you, though,
I may need some advice.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.045
Uh-huh.
About what?

40:57.200 --> 40:59.168
Well--
( chuckles ) okay.

40:59.320 --> 41:00.970
What do you think
about Wesley?

41:01.120 --> 41:02.929
Oh, he's a cool guy,
and, you kn--

41:06.800 --> 41:08.086
Wait, what about him?

41:08.240 --> 41:11.084
He's just so...

41:11.280 --> 41:12.850
I don't know.
( laughs )

41:13.000 --> 41:14.923
Exotic or something,
you know?

41:15.080 --> 41:18.050
- Because he's black.
- No, that's not it.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.445
Has he ever mentioned me?

41:21.600 --> 41:24.126
Actually,
I think he likes Jamie.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.562
I could get him if I wanted.

41:31.640 --> 41:34.450
No, I mean--
of course you could.

41:34.600 --> 41:35.931
I mean...

41:36.080 --> 41:38.367
you're beautiful
and cool, too.

41:38.520 --> 41:41.808
I mean, Marilyn, you could
have any guy you wanted.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.405
Really?

41:44.840 --> 41:46.922
Ooh, that's so sweet.
( laughs )

41:52.320 --> 41:55.927
One day, you're gonna find
the most awesome girl.

42:02.360 --> 42:03.930
( Precious whining )

42:08.520 --> 42:09.885
Here?

42:11.480 --> 42:13.005
There.

42:16.880 --> 42:18.848
Did I already say
this place is so gross?

42:19.000 --> 42:21.128
Hey, come on, all right?

42:21.280 --> 42:24.523
Just pretend you're outside
by a pretty lake.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.405
Use your imagination.

42:34.080 --> 42:37.004
I'm not screwing
on this bed.

42:37.200 --> 42:38.964
Who said anything
about screwing?

42:39.160 --> 42:41.606
( laughs )

42:41.760 --> 42:42.807
My turn next, though.

42:42.960 --> 42:45.566
Hey, scout's honor, baby.

42:45.720 --> 42:47.882
I can't believe I'm doing this.

42:48.080 --> 42:49.923
( Zipper unzips )

42:50.080 --> 42:52.082
(moaning )

42:56.400 --> 42:57.481
Jesus!

42:57.640 --> 42:59.244
What, what's wrong?
Too much teeth?

43:01.400 --> 43:02.606
( Screams )

43:04.080 --> 43:05.730
- What was that?
- Sounded like screaming.

43:05.880 --> 43:07.928
- Should we go check it out?
- Yeah, yeah, you go.

43:08.080 --> 43:09.684
I'm just gonna find my glasses.
I'll be right behind you.

43:09.840 --> 43:11.330
Hurry, Robe.

43:14.080 --> 43:15.923
( Growls )

43:22.520 --> 43:25.683
Smooth, Robe.
Very smooth.

43:29.480 --> 43:30.641
Damn it.

43:33.440 --> 43:35.602
( Sighs )
Thank God.

43:37.480 --> 43:38.641
<i>Who--.</i>

43:45.280 --> 43:47.169
What happened?

43:47.320 --> 43:49.561
- Oh, my God.
- Tell me about it.

43:49.720 --> 43:53.486
What the fuck is that, Johnnie?
Sean?

43:55.360 --> 43:57.089
This must have taken hours.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.286
Hey, man, look,
if you wanna stay here

44:01.440 --> 44:02.521
and play psycho-art
appreciation,

44:02.680 --> 44:04.170
you be my guest.

44:04.320 --> 44:05.970
Me, I'm trying to get
the hell up out of here.

44:06.160 --> 44:07.321
Who's with me?

44:11.120 --> 44:12.963
Some of these are human.

44:13.120 --> 44:14.884
( Footsteps approaching )

44:15.040 --> 44:16.724
- Oh, Jesus, oh, please, no.
- Shh, quiet.

44:16.920 --> 44:19.605
Okay, if someone comes
though this door, we jump him.

44:19.800 --> 44:21.165
Can't hurt all of us,
maybe none of us

44:21.320 --> 44:22.606
if we can tackle him, okay?

44:22.800 --> 44:24.325
- Johnnie, kill the light.
- Okay.

44:24.480 --> 44:26.369
( Footsteps approaching )

44:27.920 --> 44:29.160
NEW!

44:30.600 --> 44:32.568
Marilyn:
Get off me!

44:32.720 --> 44:35.690
What the hell
are you people doing?

44:35.840 --> 44:38.684
Yeah, sorry, we-- we thought
you were someone else.

44:38.840 --> 44:40.080
Who else would I be?

44:45.280 --> 44:48.523
Jesus.
Is that made from people?

44:52.480 --> 44:54.130
Oh, shit.

44:54.280 --> 44:55.725
Guys, I think I know
where we are.

44:55.920 --> 44:57.331
I think I heard
about this place.

44:57.480 --> 45:00.609
- What are you talking about?
- The name on the mailbox.

45:02.120 --> 45:04.088
You telling me you guys ain't
never heard of the Roads?

45:04.240 --> 45:06.368
Junior Joan
and his psycho family?

45:06.520 --> 45:08.124
- Yeah.
- No, no, that story's bullshit.

45:08.280 --> 45:10.248
- What story?
- They were killers.

45:10.400 --> 45:11.970
Not just killers.

45:12.120 --> 45:14.646
Right.
Cannibals.

45:14.800 --> 45:17.246
The rumors said
they'd become wild animals,

45:17.440 --> 45:19.841
feeding off
the local wildlife and...

45:20.000 --> 45:23.402
anything or anyone
who came along.

45:23.560 --> 45:25.927
Police showed up.
They killed the family.

45:26.080 --> 45:28.287
Supposedly they found parts
of, like, 30 people.

45:28.440 --> 45:29.566
Parts?

45:29.720 --> 45:32.087
That isn't real.

45:32.240 --> 45:34.561
It's just a story
to scare kids.

45:34.720 --> 45:35.926
Is it?

45:42.760 --> 45:46.685
I think this was my sister's.
I gave this to her.

45:46.840 --> 45:48.649
No way.
No fucking way.

45:48.800 --> 45:52.202
- No, how?
- She ran away.

45:52.360 --> 45:54.886
( Robe screams )

45:56.000 --> 45:57.604
Guys, where's Robe?

45:57.760 --> 45:59.569
He dropped his glasses
in the barn.

45:59.720 --> 46:01.449
He's still--

46:02.440 --> 46:04.169
Oh, my God.

46:04.360 --> 46:05.691
Robe?

46:06.960 --> 46:10.043
( Precious barks, whimpers )

46:19.040 --> 46:20.201
Robe?

46:33.920 --> 46:37.129
You really think that's hers?
Your sister's I mean?

46:37.280 --> 46:40.329
Do you remember what we
talked about in Anthropology?

46:40.520 --> 46:43.126
How cannibals believe they take
power from the people they eat?

46:43.320 --> 46:44.367
Adrienne.

46:44.520 --> 46:46.682
You don't think they take
their souls, do you?

46:46.840 --> 46:48.330
What if Laurie's trapped?

46:48.480 --> 46:50.244
What if she can't go
where she's supposed to be?

46:50.400 --> 46:51.890
Look, she is not trapped
anywhere, okay?

46:52.040 --> 46:53.280
If she died here-- hey.

46:53.440 --> 46:54.680
If she died here,
she is in heaven now, okay?

46:54.840 --> 46:56.046
I promise.

46:58.960 --> 47:01.770
Wait, wait, what if Robe's
not in the barn?

47:01.960 --> 47:04.088
Then we go.
Fuck Robe.

47:04.240 --> 47:06.129
You're an asshole,
you know that?

47:10.480 --> 47:12.244
Nice.

47:12.400 --> 47:14.209
Look, Johnnie's right.

47:14.360 --> 47:16.761
If Robe's not in the barn,
then we keep moving,

47:16.920 --> 47:18.410
get to the road,
get back to the bus.

47:18.600 --> 47:21.046
- Fucking A.
- And just leave him?

47:21.200 --> 47:23.043
Man, that is messed up.

47:23.200 --> 47:25.680
Look, if something's
happened to Robe,

47:25.840 --> 47:27.729
then the best thing
we can do for him is get help.

47:27.880 --> 47:29.962
Best case,
he'll meet us back at the bus.

47:30.120 --> 47:31.531
Yeah, worst case?

47:32.720 --> 47:34.722
( Robe screaming )

47:38.720 --> 47:41.564
Well, we all
heard that, right?

47:41.720 --> 47:44.200
- Oh, God.
- Okay, okay, everyone chill.

47:44.360 --> 47:45.600
Okay, that sound could have
come from anywhere.

47:45.800 --> 47:47.290
- ( Robe sobbing )
- That's Robe!

47:47.440 --> 47:49.169
- That's Robe! I know it is!
- Where are you going?

47:49.320 --> 47:51.129
Let me go!
We have to help him!

47:51.280 --> 47:52.691
No, Marilyn, wait.
Everybody, wait.

47:52.840 --> 47:55.002
We gotta be smart about this.

47:55.160 --> 47:58.084
Okay, Johnnie,
you come with me.

47:58.240 --> 48:00.083
Wes, you stay here
with the girls.

48:05.560 --> 48:06.766
Johnnie:
All right, what's our play?

48:06.920 --> 48:08.888
Sean: I think the sound
came from over there.

48:11.200 --> 48:12.440
Oh, God.

48:13.880 --> 48:15.041
(whimpers )

48:16.760 --> 48:18.205
Fuck me.

48:18.360 --> 48:19.725
Okay, we gotta get
the girls out of here.

48:24.600 --> 48:26.364
- Wait, what are you two doing?
- Nothing.

48:26.520 --> 48:28.124
(whimpers )

48:28.280 --> 48:29.406
Stay back, guys!
Stay back!

48:29.560 --> 48:31.164
No! Robe!

48:31.320 --> 48:33.527
Robe!

48:33.720 --> 48:36.849
- Adrienne!
- ( muffled scream )

48:37.000 --> 48:38.331
- Oh!

48:38.480 --> 48:40.721
( Groans )

48:40.880 --> 48:42.291
- Come on! Go! Go!
- Adrienne!

48:42.480 --> 48:44.209
No, let go of me!

48:44.400 --> 48:46.641
- ( Sean and Johnnie shouting )
- ( groaning )

48:49.920 --> 48:51.126
- No, I gotta help her!
- She's already dead!

48:51.320 --> 48:52.321
Move! Move!

48:52.480 --> 48:54.847
Go, man, go!
We're gonna fucking die!

48:55.000 --> 48:56.809
Move your ass!
Let's go!

49:00.120 --> 49:02.088
( Sobbing )

49:09.320 --> 49:10.481
Go in the house!

49:12.240 --> 49:15.449
All right, lock the doors!
All of them! Sean!

49:26.160 --> 49:27.650
What the hell
happened out there?!

49:27.800 --> 49:29.006
I don't know!

49:29.160 --> 49:30.525
Wes: Well, I do.

49:30.680 --> 49:32.409
It's one of those fucking Roads,
and we're the buffet.

49:32.560 --> 49:33.766
Man, why the hell
did we come back here?

49:33.920 --> 49:34.967
I was following him!

49:35.120 --> 49:36.929
Robe's gonna die, too,
if we don't help him, okay?!

49:37.080 --> 49:39.208
What are you guys waiting for?!
We have to go help him!

49:39.360 --> 49:41.931
- No, fuck that!
- Are you people blind?!

49:42.120 --> 49:44.202
The killer's
using Robe as bait.

49:44.360 --> 49:46.203
My best friend is dead.

49:46.360 --> 49:48.124
Please let this not be
happening.

49:48.280 --> 49:49.930
Johnnie:
Well, it's happening, okay?

49:50.080 --> 49:52.560
Look, we can all talk about
how fucked up it is later,

49:52.760 --> 49:54.603
but right now,
we need to start figuring out

49:54.800 --> 49:55.847
a way to get out of here alive.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.049
Someone will see the bus, right?
They'll come looking for us.

49:59.200 --> 50:00.850
So we're just
gonna wait here?

50:01.000 --> 50:03.321
I don't want to be eaten
by a cannonball.

50:03.520 --> 50:05.522
- It's "cannibal," God damn it!
- That's what I said!

50:05.680 --> 50:07.205
Sean:
Nobody's gonna get eaten, okay?!

50:07.400 --> 50:09.528
We're gonna stay here,
stay smart,

50:09.680 --> 50:10.806
and make it until morning,

50:10.960 --> 50:12.610
and then we'll make
a break for it.

50:12.760 --> 50:15.001
Not tonight.
It's too risky.

50:15.160 --> 50:19.210
Riskier than waiting around here
for that psycho to show back up?

50:23.320 --> 50:25.163
(grunts)

50:25.320 --> 50:27.641
( sniffs )

50:35.160 --> 50:36.924
(growling )

50:43.200 --> 50:45.248
( squelching )

50:45.400 --> 50:47.004
(grunts)

50:55.960 --> 50:57.405
What do you think
you're gonna do with that?

50:57.560 --> 50:59.289
If that motherfucker
comes near me,

50:59.440 --> 51:01.408
I'm gonna introduce
this to his skull.

51:01.560 --> 51:04.006
Yeah, Wes is right.
Let's all grab something.

51:12.600 --> 51:14.329
Let's mess him up.

51:14.480 --> 51:16.130
That make you feel better?

51:17.840 --> 51:20.923
A little bit, yeah.
So what's the plan?

51:21.080 --> 51:24.562
Okay, Jamie, Marilyn, and I
will secure the downstairs.

51:24.720 --> 51:25.960
Wes, you take the upstairs.

51:26.120 --> 51:28.009
Johnnie, Heather,
secure the main floor.

51:28.160 --> 51:29.969
If someone comes through that
front door, we should hear it.

51:30.120 --> 51:31.645
Come on.

51:52.320 --> 51:53.651
( Lighter clatters )

51:56.600 --> 51:57.840
You okay, baby?

51:59.720 --> 52:03.327
L-- I've just never seen
anyone die before.

52:11.960 --> 52:13.325
Flashlight. Here.

52:20.960 --> 52:22.564
Guys, this is creepy.

52:43.040 --> 52:44.371
Okay.

52:46.360 --> 52:48.203
Marilyn, here.

52:50.240 --> 52:51.526
Okay. Okay.

52:51.680 --> 52:53.330
We can think of this
as our Alamo, okay?

52:53.520 --> 52:55.249
This must head outside.

52:55.440 --> 52:57.807
If someone comes in upstairs,
we get down here,

52:57.960 --> 53:00.645
get to the yard,
and back to the bus, okay?

53:03.680 --> 53:06.047
( Screaming )

53:06.240 --> 53:08.208
Sean:
Get upstairs! Now! Now!

53:08.360 --> 53:09.805
Quick! Go! Go!

53:14.560 --> 53:16.801
(grunting )

53:20.480 --> 53:22.084
Go and lock the door!
Get out of here!

53:36.920 --> 53:38.524
(grunting )

54:05.160 --> 54:07.322
No!
Come on! Come on!

54:11.800 --> 54:13.802
( Screaming )

54:15.320 --> 54:17.971
- ( growling )
- ( screaming continues )

54:56.960 --> 54:58.962
Hey, you guys chill out!
Chill out, slow down.

54:59.120 --> 55:00.246
Where's Sean?

55:00.440 --> 55:01.805
He's in the cellar.
We have to go.

55:01.960 --> 55:05.009
- Sean?
- Him! The killer, you idiot!

55:05.160 --> 55:06.525
He killed Sean?
Are you sure?

55:06.680 --> 55:08.842
- Of course we're fucking sure!
- Screw this.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.411
No, get the fuck off me!

55:10.560 --> 55:11.846
I'm gonna kill
this fucking freakish!

55:12.000 --> 55:13.650
- Johnnie, no!
- We gotta go, man.

55:13.800 --> 55:15.040
We have to get back to the bus!

55:15.200 --> 55:17.123
And then what?
So he can find us there, too?

55:17.280 --> 55:18.486
No, let's do this now!

55:18.640 --> 55:20.244
Maybe he won't
follow us there, Johnnie!

55:20.400 --> 55:22.528
- Maybe he won't go that far!
- Yeah, and maybe he will.

55:22.680 --> 55:24.887
Johnnie, we gotta
get the fuck out of here, man!

55:25.040 --> 55:27.281
Fine.
Let's go!

55:30.400 --> 55:34.371
All right, once we get outside,
we haul ass, you hear me?

55:36.080 --> 55:37.730
- Back door!
- ( screams )

55:38.840 --> 55:40.171
Help me get the fridge!

55:42.600 --> 55:43.761
Go, go!

55:50.400 --> 55:51.561
Come on!

55:57.280 --> 55:59.123
- This way!
- Where the hell are we going?

55:59.280 --> 56:01.089
I don't know!
Is he still behind us?

56:03.960 --> 56:05.371
We have to keep moving.

56:05.520 --> 56:07.921
We have to help him.
He's still alive.

56:08.080 --> 56:09.730
It hurts.

56:09.880 --> 56:11.245
(crying )

56:11.400 --> 56:13.402
What's he saying?

56:13.560 --> 56:16.086
Kill me.

56:19.240 --> 56:20.401
Look!

56:22.240 --> 56:24.447
All right, we can take care
of this psycho right now.

56:25.840 --> 56:27.001
You good?

56:29.600 --> 56:31.841
- No, fuck this!
- Run!

56:32.000 --> 56:33.764
(women scream )

56:37.160 --> 56:40.448
( screams )

56:44.120 --> 56:45.963
( screaming )

56:52.800 --> 56:55.531
( screaming continues )

57:10.960 --> 57:13.964
(growling )

57:21.280 --> 57:23.886
( roaring )

57:38.040 --> 57:40.168
He's out there somewhere.

57:40.320 --> 57:43.005
He sounded pretty far away.
I say we make our move.

57:43.160 --> 57:45.686
- I don't know.
- Well, I do.

57:45.840 --> 57:47.763
I've been following you people
around all night, and so far,

57:47.920 --> 57:49.684
it's gotten three of us killed.

57:49.840 --> 57:51.126
I don't wanna be next.
Do you?

57:51.320 --> 57:54.369
- No.
- Good.

57:54.520 --> 57:55.681
Now come on.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.082
We're gonna find out
where that mother fucker is

58:00.240 --> 58:03.403
and as we know he ain't coming,
we run like hell, you got it?

58:13.520 --> 58:15.363
All right, come on.

58:15.520 --> 58:17.887
I don't wanna go out there.

58:18.040 --> 58:19.201
He's gonna get us, Wes.

58:19.360 --> 58:20.805
We're gonna be fine.

58:23.360 --> 58:24.441
Look, we'll go out
the back door.

58:24.640 --> 58:26.005
It's closest to the road.

58:28.600 --> 58:29.647
Be careful.

58:29.800 --> 58:31.211
Quiet.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.490
All right,
we're all clear over here.

58:50.120 --> 58:51.281
Oh, shit!

58:51.440 --> 58:53.568
( Screams )

58:53.720 --> 58:55.449
<i>' No!</i>

58:55.600 --> 58:57.728
No! No!

58:59.080 --> 59:01.128
( Both scream )

59:01.280 --> 59:03.009
No!

59:04.360 --> 59:06.169
<i>'</i> Marilyn!
- Wes!

59:06.320 --> 59:08.288
Marilyn! No!

59:09.280 --> 59:10.441
Wes!

59:10.600 --> 59:13.251
Oh, God, please, no, no!

59:13.440 --> 59:16.125
( Both scream )

59:16.320 --> 59:18.641
- ( growls )
- ( Marilyn screams )

59:23.600 --> 59:25.409
( Marilyn whimpering )

59:28.560 --> 59:30.562
- We should help her.
- Screw that.

59:30.720 --> 59:32.688
- ( Precious yips )
- Shut that dog up.

59:32.880 --> 59:34.370
Shh, shh.

59:36.120 --> 59:37.281
Okay, let's go.

59:58.440 --> 59:59.885
- E, what is this place?
- Shh!

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.247
( Whispers )
Keep quiet and follow me.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.130
We're not out
in the open, are we?

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.764
Okay, we just need a place
to hole up for the night.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.123
( Precious whimpers )

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.284
It's gonna be okay,
Precious.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.531
Come on.

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.444
That barn,
it's just across the way.

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.650
All right,
but you gotta be quiet.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.006
You got it?

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.369
( Precious whimpers, yips )

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.361
Johnnie?

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.522
It's okay.
Don't look.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.204
( Precious whimpers )

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.121
We're gonna make it, okay?

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.009
But we need
to keep our heads.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.169
I think we can hide out here
until morning.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:33.005
At night, that crazy fuck
can come out of anywhere.

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.326
I don't wanna die,
Johnnie.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.722
Okay, I'm gonna
take care of you.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.206
( Precious whimpering )

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.089
You need to keep
that thing quiet.

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:47.811
Stay close.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.086
Come on.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.086
Stay close.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.811
Okay, we'll be safe
in the back of this, okay?

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.121
Are you sure?

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.884
Trust me, baby.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.290
- ( Hinges squeak)
- ( metallic squealing )

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.411
Okay, get in.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.367
( Disco music playing )

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.691
Oh, you punks
are gonna pay.

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.044
( Music stops )

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.004
( groans )

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.366
Hello?

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.561
Joyriding delinquents.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.207
- ( Creaking )
- Johnnie: Shh!

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.126
( Johnnie whispers )
We have to keep still.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.971
This thing creaks and moans
like an old woman.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.530
Hey, you're doing great,
Heather, okay?

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:19.323
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.609
Try and relax.
We're sleeping right here, okay?

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.129
I don't think
I'll ever sleep again.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:34.931
In the morning,
we'll bust out, hit the road.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:38.766
I'll bet the bus will be filled
with cops by then.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:41.491
And they'll have
blankets and coffee,

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:45.042
and you can fucking A be sure
they'll have donuts, too.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.646
And we'll go home.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.929
We'll get old and fat,
and we'll have a ton of kids.

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.963
I love you, Johnnie.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.282
( Precious whimpering )

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.805
Shh.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.445
What's wrong with her?

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.728
Maybe the bad man is back.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.966
- Shh.
- ( whimpering )

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.040
Heather!

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.771
( Growls )

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.445
Just keep her quiet.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:22.406
(whimpering continues )

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.969
Shh.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.805
- Shh!
e ( whimpering )

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.371
Heather!

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.602
I mean it, Heather.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:36.331
One bark from that thing
and we're dead, understand that?

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:40.647
(whimpering )

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.321
- ( Precious growling )
- Heather: Shh.

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.642
- What are you doing?
- It's gonna be okay.

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:46.961
( Precious growling )

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.168
-( neck cracks )
- ( Precious yelps )

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.971
( sobbing )

01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.650
( clang )

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:04.011
- Did he hear? Is it him?
- Shh!

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.083
I don't know.
Quiet.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:29.440
We have to go.

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:31.364
We'll bust out here
and make a break for it.

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.720
(gurgling )

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.530
(whispers )
Heather.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.885
( Gasps )

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.644
( screaming )
Help! Help!

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:53.041
Help! Help!
( screams )

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:59.361
No, no! No! No!

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:01.885
( Squelches )

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.045
( chuckles )

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:48.610
If I can track the CC
in the rainy season,

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:52.446
I can damn sure
find these brats.

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:55.046
( Panting )

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.449
( sighs )

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.008
(dripping)

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:17.651
( rustling )

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.487
(Yelps )

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.051
Jamie!

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.890
( Both laughing )

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:28.483
I didn't think anyone was left.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.287
What happened?

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:34.011
Don't worry, I'll survive.

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.002
You okay?

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.366
We're all that's left.

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:40.091
How can you know that?
Wesley--

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:41.287
Oh, no.

01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:43.408
I heard his eye pop, Jamie.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.368
When the glass hit it,
I heard it pop.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.249
It was horrible.

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:49.004
It's gonna be okay, Mar.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:53.688
( laughs ) No.
It's not. It's not.

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.683
We're gonna die here.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.046
By the time anyone finds us,
we'll be dead.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.850
You're cold.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.011
And sweating, too.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.885
Look, Marilyn,
focus on what I'm saying.

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:08.649
You're going
into shock, that's all.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:11.890
You're gonna be all right,

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.444
but you have
to stay focused, okay?

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.680
Okay.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.524
I mean it, Marilyn,
you have to stay with me.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.808
I will, I-- I just
need to sit down.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.529
- I just--
- No. You have to stay up.

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:22.920
Otherwise you're just
gonna pass out.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.401
I can't drag you.
You understand what I'm saying?

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:28.211
Yes.

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:29.441
Okay.

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:32.291
Give me a second to find
something to fight back with.

01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:35.450
I got him pretty good
with a rock back there. Ah!

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:41.044
I think he may be the devil,
Jamie.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.439
Jamie:
I don't know.

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:48.122
He must be...

01:09:48.279 --> 01:09:50.203
a demon from hell
or something.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.404
I looked into his eyes.

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.891
What we need to worry
about right now

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.565
is getting back to the bus.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.929
( laughs )
It's hopeless.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.122
It's over now.

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.045
What do you think?

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.129
I think it's fate.

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.724
( Screaming )

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.891
( screams )

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.570
( growls )

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.406
( panting )
Oh, my God.

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:42.847
( Disco music playing )

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:49.931
( music stops )

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:04.601
Hello?!

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:09.281
Jamie:
Someone please help me!

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.044
Who is that?
Adrienne?

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:14.289
Here!
I'm over here!

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.727
Mr. C!
We have to go.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:19.042
Jamie, you and your friends
are in some trouble--

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.361
Fuck your trouble!

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.284
Jamie, don't you
talk to me like that.

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:24.841
They're dead.
They're all dead.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.286
Who?

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:29.762
- All of them!
- What? How?

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:33.049
This guy killed them all.
We have to go.

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.929
We leave no man left behind.

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:37.082
Now stand down
and tell me where they are.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:39.004
You don't understand.
We have to get out of here now.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:41.606
Are they in there?
Are they in the house?

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.649
Where are they?
Come on.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.485
( Screams )

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.368
( growls )

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.170
Jamie, get in the house.

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.607
Close the door and don't
come out until I say so.

01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:01.331
No, no, he'll get you.
You have to come inside.

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.608
Mr. C:
He's just a man,

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:04.886
a man who's gonna
have to get through me

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.530
to get to one of my kids.

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:08.170
Now stay in there.

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.006
All right.

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:17.525
I'm no teenager.

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:21.887
I was in the 'Nam,
you sick fuck!

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:25.169
And I got chunks of guys
like you in my stool!

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:29.365
Come on, you commie,
pinko, fag bastard.

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:33.206
I've killed more men
than you could possibly imagine.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:38.450
One more is fine with me.

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:41.046
You Hanoi chink piece of shit!

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.931
-( Blows landing )
- ( Joan growling )

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.525
( footsteps approaching )

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.249
Mr. C?

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.169
Mr. Cunningham?!

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.321
( Screaming )

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.882
Leave me alone!

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.166
Adrienne.
Oh!

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:28.925
Open!

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.766
(grunts)

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.605
( growls )

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:52.966
How do you like that?!

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.770
( Growls )

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:58.127
( screaming )

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:19.927
No, no, no.

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:25.805
Fuck.

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.805
Come on, Mr. C.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:31.201
Have something I can use.
Come on.

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.004
Ah! BAP.

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.608
( Screams )

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.484
Just breathe.
Just breathe.

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:56.041
( Panting )

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.367
( groans, panting )

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.845
All right.

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:28.410
I made it.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.202
No.

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:37.522
( Door creaks open )

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.848
( screams )

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.401
Help! Help me!

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.244
( Screaming )

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:13.803
( chuckles )

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.881
- ( growling )
- ( varying ) 0, my God.

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.684
" ( Grunts)
" ( screaming )

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:40.685
( growls )

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:44.887
<i>He'! '</i>

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.281
Hey, are you okay, mister?

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:49.602
Hey.
What the f--

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.762
Hey, you stay right there
or I will shoot.

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.291
I mean it!

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.885
<i>Shoot'.</i>

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.451
Son of a bitch.

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.724
(thuds)

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:21.450
(siren wailing)

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:35.682
- ( siren stops )
- ( police radio chatter)

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.849
(crying )

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:52.327
Hell of a mess, Sheriff.

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.522
I've never seen nothing like it.

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.210
Sheriff:
Junior Joan.

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.328
Now that's one bad penny

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:09.131
I never thought
I'd have to see again.

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.971
How you doing,
sweetheart?

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.168
You okay?

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:23.800
Can you tell me how many
other people were with you?

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:26.965
Seven.

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.645
They're all dead.

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.927
But where are they?
Where are your friends?

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:35.128
The house.

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.044
The house on the hill.

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:41.766
Okay.

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:46.011
Okay, look,
get some rest.

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:48.646
These folks, they're gonna take
real good care of you.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.211
Then I'll come back
in a little while.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:52.249
I'll check up
on you, all right?

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:55.290
You're gonna be okay.
You'll be okay.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.647
(sobs)

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.281
What is it?

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:04.003
She said something
that shook you up pretty good.

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:08.086
You hadn't even joined the force
when we had our troubles.

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:10.921
You gonna keep me
in the dark, Sheriff,

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:14.050
or is this some type
of ghost story?

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.407
It's worse.

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:17.931
It's a lot worse.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:25.086
The Roads, they never came
to town at the end.

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:28.045
Some people thought
they'd picked up and moved off.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:31.005
Then we started
getting the calls.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.282
Somebody's kid
went missing.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:38.287
And then somebody's wife,
somebody's husband.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.647
Me and a couple of the boys,
we went up there.

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.131
( Sheriff over loudspeaker)
Emmett Joan!

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:45.489
This is your last chance!

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:48.291
Emmett Joan: Sheriff,
we're gonna eat you alive!

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:51.523
(gunfire)

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:54.326
We killed
every last one of them.

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:56.289
Or so we thought.

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.204
Until today.

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.681
Junior must have been
up here hunting by himself

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:02.968
for a long time.

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.521
( Birds chirping )

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.567
( Jamie gasps )

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:41.529
( Jamie breathing heavily )
Oh.

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:47.004
( Screams )

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:01.286
( music playing )

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:55.883
( roars )

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:59.169
