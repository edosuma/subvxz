WEBVTT

00:12.417 --> 00:13.375
- Previously on "Below Deck"...

00:13.000 --> 00:13.375
- So nice to just--

00:14.792 --> 00:15.833
- To just go out for dinner?

00:15.833 --> 00:17.625
Ben is a complete romantic.

00:17.625 --> 00:18.708
- I don't think
I can serve that.

00:18.708 --> 00:20.375
What do you think, hon?

00:20.375 --> 00:23.167
- It's very annoying
that Ben goes around my head

00:23.167 --> 00:24.333
to ask Emily's opinion.

00:24.333 --> 00:26.000
- Well, Ashley.
- Who's Ashley?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.167
- The girl
that I've kind of been seeing.

00:27.167 --> 00:29.542
She's transgender.
- Hmm?

00:29.542 --> 00:31.333
- What are you doing?
- I've worked on big boats,

00:31.333 --> 00:33.667
and I've never really seen
such a sh--show.

00:33.667 --> 00:34.958
- I'm gonna eat your pizza.

00:34.958 --> 00:36.333
- We don't need
to live in filth.

00:36.333 --> 00:38.708
- I don't appreciate it.
- God damn it.

00:38.708 --> 00:41.167
- What do you have there?
- Someone left the toaster on.

00:41.167 --> 00:43.208
- And the hits keep coming.

00:43.208 --> 00:45.458
- If I have to address it
one more time,

00:45.458 --> 00:47.667
everybody's gonna be
confined down there.

00:47.667 --> 00:49.875
- Cheers.
- I feel like my trousers

00:49.875 --> 00:52.042
are a little--

00:52.042 --> 00:53.583
I'm wasted!

00:53.583 --> 00:55.375
- Whoa. F---.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.250
- Come on, Ben, get up

01:33.250 --> 01:35.625
so the master would be free
for us to clean.

01:35.625 --> 01:37.708
And I'm sure the crew would like
to have some food today.

01:37.708 --> 01:39.917
- Kate, you're not my boss,
okay?

01:39.917 --> 01:41.292
- Okay, but I didn't say
you could be in the master,

01:41.292 --> 01:42.292
so please get out.

01:42.292 --> 01:43.542
We need to clean it.

01:43.542 --> 01:45.750
- Okay, but yeah,
just make sure

01:45.750 --> 01:47.125
you never tell me what to do.

01:47.125 --> 01:48.583
- Bye!

01:52.042 --> 01:54.625
- What's the deal?

01:54.625 --> 01:56.083
This is not good.

01:56.083 --> 01:59.250
Oh my God.
This is way too far.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.958
Lauren, do you know what
happened in the master bathroom?

02:01.958 --> 02:03.583
A panel was, like,
off the wall.

02:03.583 --> 02:06.792
- Sh--. No.
- Okay.

02:06.792 --> 02:09.750
- I got you a cup of chai.
- Oh, thank you.

02:11.958 --> 02:13.958
Seriously,
don't do anything, okay?

02:13.958 --> 02:16.333
- Well, now I'm gonna have
to make a pretty,

02:16.333 --> 02:17.333
pretty big deal out of it.

02:17.333 --> 02:18.625
- No you're not.

02:19.833 --> 02:21.083
- Yeah, he is.
- He's having

02:21.083 --> 02:22.125
a bit of a sleep in.

02:22.125 --> 02:24.292
- We got loose last night.

02:24.292 --> 02:26.667
He likes you, Ems.
He thought you were cool.

02:26.667 --> 02:28.625
- Really?
- I think it's really nice

02:28.625 --> 02:30.833
that we're all gonna be able
to go out tonight.

02:30.833 --> 02:33.917
It's very hard to get
James's approval for a girl.

02:33.917 --> 02:37.000
I mean, he's seen
a lot of them.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.625
You're gonna be the guest
of honor, though.

02:38.625 --> 02:41.208
I don't--no.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.667
- Deck crew, deck crew?

02:44.667 --> 02:47.125
Can somebody please meet me
in the master bathroom?

02:49.667 --> 02:51.167
All of a sudden,

02:51.167 --> 02:53.125
I hear some walkie chatter,

02:53.125 --> 02:55.208
and I know
something's gone wrong.

02:55.208 --> 02:58.000
Hey, Kate.
- Hey, Captain Lee.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.458
- Where's the damage
in here?

02:59.458 --> 03:01.375
- There's a panel
in the bathroom

03:01.375 --> 03:03.375
that's off the wall.

03:03.375 --> 03:04.958
We can pop it back.

03:04.958 --> 03:08.042
But I don't know
how it came off the wall.

03:08.042 --> 03:09.542
'Cause it's not Velcro,

03:09.542 --> 03:11.208
so I don't know
why it would be off the wall.

03:11.208 --> 03:13.375
- What the f---
happened last night?

03:13.375 --> 03:14.875
- We have guests
arriving tomorrow,

03:14.875 --> 03:18.042
and there's a panel broken
in the master.

03:18.042 --> 03:19.542
We're all in deep trouble.

03:19.542 --> 03:21.542
- Does anybody know
anything about it?

03:21.542 --> 03:23.375
- I know all the deckhands
were in here,

03:23.375 --> 03:25.500
and then Ben joined them, so.

03:25.500 --> 03:28.375
- This particular panel houses
the control

03:28.375 --> 03:30.292
for a $10,000 toilet.

03:30.292 --> 03:33.292
And if that gets broken,
we're out of business.

03:33.292 --> 03:35.292
I suggest we get
all the deckhands together.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.417
- I was in the galley,
and Kate was like,

03:39.417 --> 03:42.333
"Um, a panel came off
in the bathroom, in the master."

03:42.333 --> 03:45.333
I was like, "I don't recall
anything coming off last night."

03:45.333 --> 03:46.417
- You know what? Don't care.

03:46.417 --> 03:47.875
- Yeah.

03:47.875 --> 03:50.542
- I need Kate, Kelley,

03:50.542 --> 03:54.250
Ben, Lauren, Kyle and Nico

03:54.250 --> 03:56.833
in the crew area now.

03:58.875 --> 04:01.208
- Brought you as well?
- Yeah.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.083
- Oh.

04:03.083 --> 04:04.417
- Well, what's going on?

04:04.417 --> 04:08.000
- Don't worry about it.
- Oh.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.917
- Everybody happy?

04:09.917 --> 04:11.417
- So happy.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.208
- Good.

04:13.208 --> 04:16.250
Because I'm not.

04:16.250 --> 04:17.750
- What's this about?

04:20.625 --> 04:23.458
- This group, collectively.

04:23.458 --> 04:27.708
I find your behavior
unacceptable.

04:27.708 --> 04:29.583
That toilet in there is $10,000,

04:29.583 --> 04:31.417
and for me to go
into that master

04:31.417 --> 04:34.583
and find it
a f---ing train wreck--

04:34.583 --> 04:36.083
I expected more.

04:36.083 --> 04:40.375
This is not your personal
f---ing party palace.

04:40.375 --> 04:43.042
And you have been treating it
as such.

04:43.042 --> 04:44.750
And it stops now.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.708
- I've tried to protect them
all season.

04:46.708 --> 04:47.875
Like, the nights
that I do relax,

04:47.875 --> 04:49.625
when I do go to bed early,

04:49.625 --> 04:51.083
I keep getting f---ed with
because of y'all.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.875
I'm just pissed off.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.625
- Everybody here has been told

04:54.625 --> 04:57.917
that they were on their last
go-round of warnings

04:57.917 --> 05:01.625
as far as showing
a lack of respect for the boat.

05:01.625 --> 05:07.292
Tonight, you four are gonna be
confined to the crew area.

05:07.292 --> 05:11.292
I'll see you two up top.

05:11.292 --> 05:13.417
Conversation's over.

05:13.417 --> 05:15.333
- Unfortunately,
they're my guys.

05:15.333 --> 05:19.000
They f---ed up,
so I pay the piper with them.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
- I'm f---ing pissed, and I want
their ass in bed early tonight.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
So when I walk through
this boat at eleven o'clock,

05:25.000 --> 05:26.667
I better not see
a swinging dick anywhere.

05:26.667 --> 05:29.667
- Roger that.
- Captain Lee is more angry

05:29.667 --> 05:31.625
than I've ever seen him before.

05:31.625 --> 05:34.000
And I'm not sure
if Kelley and I are

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
part of the in-trouble group
or not.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.167
- Kelley, you can't stick
your head in the sand.

05:38.167 --> 05:41.375
- Yeah.
- They're your responsibility.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.208
And I expect you
to call them on it.

05:43.208 --> 05:45.708
You're not gonna
be well-liked for it.

05:45.708 --> 05:47.708
Comes with the territory.

05:47.708 --> 05:50.542
- Kate can go f--- herself.

05:50.542 --> 05:52.167
- Wait, do you think
Kate framed us?

05:52.167 --> 05:53.542
- I'm not saying she framed us,

05:53.542 --> 05:55.708
but I do blame Kate
for telling Captain Lee.

05:55.708 --> 05:58.667
- We weren't in the toilet.
- She definitely did this.

05:58.667 --> 06:01.833
- No one ripped that panel
off the wall.

06:01.833 --> 06:03.958
It just popped out.
It must have.

06:03.958 --> 06:06.458
We need to be
good little children,

06:06.458 --> 06:09.375
at least today,
and then we get loose.

06:12.208 --> 06:16.292
- I swear to God, if I catch
one of them out of that area,

06:16.292 --> 06:18.292
I am gonna f---ing go off,

06:18.292 --> 06:21.542
and it'll be swift,
and it'll be severe.

06:21.542 --> 06:23.708
And you don't want to operate
short-handed.

06:25.833 --> 06:27.833
Let's get the boat flipped.
- Thank you.

06:27.833 --> 06:29.917
- Thank you.
- I have been too lenient.

06:29.917 --> 06:33.000
Being their friend
isn't working.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.167
Tonight, in bed,
10:00 everybody.

06:35.167 --> 06:36.875
- All right.
- You laughing is

06:36.875 --> 06:39.417
about the worst thing
that you could do right now.

06:39.417 --> 06:41.083
'Cause the next step
that comes after this

06:41.083 --> 06:42.417
is one of y'all gets fired.

06:42.417 --> 06:44.208
- Why? I'm not laughing.

06:44.208 --> 06:46.875
- We heard it while
I was getting my ass chewed.

06:46.875 --> 06:51.417
Do you get that?
Like, now is not a funny time.

06:51.417 --> 06:54.083
- Ten o'clock?
Go f--- yourself.

06:54.083 --> 06:56.042
I'm f---ing done with this sh--.

06:58.042 --> 07:02.417
- If Ben, Lauren, Nico or Kyle
are in the guest quarters,

07:02.417 --> 07:04.042
you have to tell me.
- Copy that.

07:04.042 --> 07:06.417
- Copy.
- Sorry.

07:06.417 --> 07:08.917
- Hon, you would
never do that to me.

07:08.917 --> 07:10.292
- I don't want to be talked
to like that.

07:10.292 --> 07:12.208
It's as simple as that.

07:12.208 --> 07:14.625
I think Kelley's doing
a really bad job as boatswain.

07:14.625 --> 07:16.458
We're f---ing working,
and he just, boom,

07:16.458 --> 07:18.792
shut the door, "You're in bed
at ten o'clock tonight."

07:18.792 --> 07:20.875
At the beginning of the season
he's too soft.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.458
Now he's too hard.

07:22.458 --> 07:24.625
Like, Kelley,
find the middle ground.

07:24.625 --> 07:27.125
- Oh, f---, I want
to f---ing rip that finger

07:27.125 --> 07:28.958
and shove it up his ass.

07:33.542 --> 07:35.708
- Your brother's
still here, right?

07:35.708 --> 07:37.583
- Yeah.
- Were you planning to have,

07:37.583 --> 07:39.375
like, dinner with him
or something tonight,

07:39.375 --> 07:40.792
but now you can't
leave the boat?

07:40.792 --> 07:42.792
- What did he say
about leaving the boat?

07:42.792 --> 07:44.542
Did he ground us?

07:44.542 --> 07:47.625
I thought he just said
we can't go to guest cabins.

07:47.625 --> 07:49.292
- You are not allowed
to leave the boat.

07:49.292 --> 07:52.500
Ben has a selectively
convenient short-term memory.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.125
He thinks he's above the rules,
and he's just not.

07:55.125 --> 07:57.833
- What, is he trying to make me
pissed off or something?

07:57.833 --> 07:59.500
This is f---ing ridiculous.

07:59.500 --> 08:01.167
Well, who blew the whistle?
Was that you?

08:01.167 --> 08:03.000
- No, actually, I didn't
tell on you, but thank you

08:03.000 --> 08:04.667
for even thinking
that I would do such a thing.

08:04.667 --> 08:05.667
- Well,
there's quite a few people

08:05.667 --> 08:07.250
that think you did rat them out,

08:07.250 --> 08:09.000
so maybe you want to just go
and talk to them.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.292
- No, I really don't.
- Because you don't care.

08:11.292 --> 08:13.333
- You have no reason to be mad
at me right now,

08:13.333 --> 08:14.625
so I'm not gonna stand here.

08:14.625 --> 08:16.667
- Just to clarify something:

08:16.667 --> 08:20.833
confined to quarters means
confined to the boat. Period.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.000
- Okay, this is the first
I'm hearing about it right now.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
- No, I said it downstairs
in the crew quarters

08:25.000 --> 08:28.292
when we had the meeting.

08:28.292 --> 08:30.958
- Well...
- Yes?

08:30.958 --> 08:35.375
- My brother is here.
He came to visit me.

08:35.375 --> 08:38.333
- I'm sorry, Ben, I can't
apply things selectively.

08:38.333 --> 08:41.208
- What can I do?
Can he come here?

08:45.208 --> 08:46.375
- If he wants to
come down to the boat,

08:46.375 --> 08:47.667
and you want
to say good-bye to him,

08:47.667 --> 08:50.667
I don't have an issue with that.
- Okay.

08:54.833 --> 08:56.875
- You know that,
like, anxious feeling?

08:56.875 --> 08:59.833
- Yeah.
- This could get really bad.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.333
- I'm very glad.
- Yeah.

09:06.208 --> 09:07.958
- Hey, Nico?
- Yeah?

09:07.958 --> 09:10.917
- For now I just want
kind of everybody to split up.

09:10.917 --> 09:12.417
- Yeah, I'm gonna go sort out
the lavs now anyway.

09:12.417 --> 09:14.208
- All right.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.875
- I'm doing anything, man.
- It's getting--no, no, no.

09:23.875 --> 09:25.417
- You know, and it's fine,
I just don't need you

09:25.417 --> 09:26.750
coming at me like that.
- I'm not coming at you.

09:26.750 --> 09:27.917
- You just did.
- I'm telling you--

09:27.917 --> 09:29.417
Give me a break.

09:29.417 --> 09:31.083
- I'm trying to, man,
and I respect that.

09:31.083 --> 09:32.083
- Because guess what?
Every single time y'all f--- up,

09:32.083 --> 09:33.917
guess who deals with it?
Me.

09:33.917 --> 09:35.083
- I understand that.
- And y'all don't even have

09:35.083 --> 09:36.583
to deal with it
half the f---ing time.

09:36.583 --> 09:38.042
- I understand that.
- You don't understand.

09:38.042 --> 09:39.083
- I do.
- You don't, because you haven't

09:39.083 --> 09:40.417
been in this position.

09:40.417 --> 09:41.917
- You don't need to come
at me like that.

09:41.917 --> 09:43.167
- Yeah, I do,
because I'm you're f---ing boss.

09:43.167 --> 09:44.417
And you know what?
Y'all f---ed up.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.750
- You're in bed by 10:00?
- Yeah.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.000
- Really?
- Yeah. One f---ing night.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.375
- Don't come at me telling me.

09:48.375 --> 09:50.292
- I can come at you
however the f--- I want.

09:50.292 --> 09:51.458
- Do it.

09:54.292 --> 09:55.208
- Y'all f---ed up.

09:54.667 --> 09:55.208
- You're in bed by ten o'clock?

09:57.125 --> 09:58.917
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Really? Really?

09:58.917 --> 10:00.625
- If I tell you that f---ing
you're in bed by ten o'clock,

10:00.625 --> 10:02.042
deal with it.

10:02.042 --> 10:03.458
- I'm not f---ing arguing
with you.

10:03.458 --> 10:04.875
- Go get your sh--.
Go clean.

10:04.875 --> 10:06.125
- Deal.
- It's not that f---ing hard.

10:06.125 --> 10:08.250
- Sounds good.
- Yeah, it is.

10:13.375 --> 10:16.625
- I need Ben, Kate, and Kelley
in the crew mess now, please.

10:16.625 --> 10:17.917
- Copy.

10:19.208 --> 10:21.125
- Number eight, sports fans.

10:21.125 --> 10:24.208
Somebody we all know and love.

10:24.208 --> 10:27.375
- Aww.
- Mr. Slover is back.

10:27.375 --> 10:28.792
- I knew he couldn't stay away.

10:28.792 --> 10:30.958
Dean and I have so much history.

10:30.958 --> 10:33.250
- You're coming off
kind of bitchy.

10:33.250 --> 10:36.833
- I made a rocket ship
on the bed.

10:36.833 --> 10:40.083
But now he's
my charter guest wingman.

10:40.083 --> 10:42.625
I bet Dean will be happy
to see you back.

10:42.625 --> 10:47.167
- Ben, as usual, Dean's gonna be
very punctual with everything.

10:47.167 --> 10:49.167
- I know he's very particular.

10:49.167 --> 10:50.667
- Whatever you have to do,

10:50.667 --> 10:53.125
hour and 15 minutes,
start to finish.

10:53.125 --> 10:54.583
- Mm-hmm.

10:54.583 --> 10:56.667
It's not gonna be
an easy charter at all.

10:56.667 --> 10:59.417
- Well, guys,
everybody's preferences

10:59.417 --> 11:01.000
are Dean's preferences.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.833
He likes a cheese
and meat plate at 5:30,

11:03.833 --> 11:05.917
and a drink of the day, Kate.

11:05.917 --> 11:08.333
Fireworks,
and the only other request is

11:08.333 --> 11:11.000
they'd like to visit
the baths in Virgin Gorda.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.208
- I'm actually really relieved.
No surprises. Just be perfect.

11:14.208 --> 11:17.042
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

11:17.042 --> 11:19.708
- Can't wait for this
to f---ing end.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.708
- Yeah, hi, I need to make
an order for some fireworks.

11:24.708 --> 11:25.958
- Done.
- Kate's just--

11:25.958 --> 11:27.542
she's just being dramatic.

11:27.542 --> 11:29.125
- I'm gonna be honest
with you, mate.

11:29.125 --> 11:31.208
I don't mind being punished. But
you can't--

11:31.208 --> 11:33.208
that's double jeopardy--you're
saying that they're confined

11:33.208 --> 11:34.375
to crew quarters, then they've
got to go to bed at 10:00.

11:34.375 --> 11:35.708
That's two punishments,
mate.

11:35.708 --> 11:36.958
- Not my call.
- Oh, I think he's

11:36.958 --> 11:38.208
a f---ing douchebag,

11:38.208 --> 11:39.833
and he's a f---ing poor leader.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.208
But that's just
my f---ing opinion.

11:42.208 --> 11:44.208
Kelley's just this military base
of, like,

11:44.208 --> 11:47.875
"Go to bed. Go eat.
Go to sleep."

11:47.875 --> 11:50.042
And it's like, no.
You're being a bad leader.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.958
But I'm not boatswain, am I?

11:51.958 --> 11:53.667
So I'm just gonna be a deckhand
and do my job.

11:53.667 --> 11:55.500
And shut the f--- up.

12:00.417 --> 12:04.333
- I'll meet you in the master.
- Okay, I'm gonna roll this.

12:04.333 --> 12:08.042
- Hey, guys. Ben insinuated
that I ratted you all out

12:08.042 --> 12:09.833
to the captain, and I didn't.

12:09.833 --> 12:12.500
I'm a little bit insulted
that I have to clarify that,

12:12.500 --> 12:14.250
but apparently I do.

12:14.250 --> 12:15.833
I wasn't gonna mention it
to him,

12:15.833 --> 12:17.750
just like I haven't
mentioned to him

12:17.750 --> 12:20.500
any other things that
have happened after hours.

12:20.500 --> 12:24.000
- The root of all evil
on this boat is Kate.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.917
She's manipulating.
She's conniving.

12:26.917 --> 12:29.542
Just stirring the pot.

12:43.958 --> 12:45.917
- Good night, you guys.
- Night.

12:45.917 --> 12:47.542
- I was almost
sleeping just then.

12:47.542 --> 12:49.042
- Like, just as he came in?

12:49.042 --> 12:51.375
Just go back to sleep.

12:51.375 --> 12:53.792
- Are the guys down there?
- No one's down there.

12:53.792 --> 12:55.792
No one's around.
Man, I'm waiting for my brother.

12:55.792 --> 12:58.042
- We're confined to crew
quarters at 10:00.

12:58.042 --> 13:00.042
- Yeah, but I got the--
he's okay with it.

13:02.458 --> 13:05.792
- Ben, hey! How are you, mate?
- Good, man, how are you?

13:05.792 --> 13:07.208
- Good.
- Yeah?

13:11.458 --> 13:14.125
- I'll give it
another 15 minutes or so.

13:14.125 --> 13:18.417
- Ben, you're drinking out of
an ashtray with a handle on it.

13:18.417 --> 13:20.000
That is absurd.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.500
- Yeah. So what do you think
of this munchkin?

13:22.500 --> 13:26.333
- Munchkin? I haven't heard that
for a while. I'll use that.

13:26.333 --> 13:29.333
- No, I think Em is great.

13:29.333 --> 13:31.000
- Isn't she?
Proper English girl.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.667
- So far, so good.
- It's lovely having James here.

13:34.667 --> 13:36.083
He makes me miss my family.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.833
This is a big part of my life,

13:37.833 --> 13:40.167
and I'm so glad that he's able
to share it with me.

13:40.167 --> 13:43.917
Captain Lee's upstairs,
which is very out of character.

13:43.917 --> 13:46.417
- Is there a time frame on how
long you're allowed to be here?

13:46.417 --> 13:48.000
- We have
to keep our clothes on,

13:48.000 --> 13:49.583
we're not allowed
to drink champagne,

13:49.583 --> 13:52.167
and we're not allowed
to dive off the boat.

13:52.167 --> 13:54.250
- So we can eat caviar,
just in the crew mess,

13:54.250 --> 13:55.333
and drink whiskey?

13:55.333 --> 13:57.292
- Where there's a loophole.

13:57.292 --> 13:58.917
Do you want some caviar?
- Oh, yes, Ben.

13:58.917 --> 14:00.708
- Ah, no, that's not
enough for you.

14:00.708 --> 14:02.542
- What type is that?
Is it beluga?

14:02.542 --> 14:05.042
- That's very sweet of you.
- She's very hospitable.

14:05.042 --> 14:06.708
No, it's actually
very affordable,

14:06.708 --> 14:09.167
but I've found an affordable
caviar that I like.

14:09.167 --> 14:11.042
And it doesn't kill budget.

14:11.042 --> 14:13.708
- I agreed to let Ben's brother
come and say good-bye to him.

14:13.708 --> 14:16.542
That doesn't mean, you know,
it's a two, three-hour goodbye.

14:16.542 --> 14:18.208
Could I have a word?
- Absolutely.

14:18.208 --> 14:19.500
- Thank you.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.542
But as Ben normally does,

14:21.542 --> 14:25.500
he takes everything
to the absolute limit.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.708
- Good evening.

14:26.708 --> 14:28.875
- I want him gone
and you asleep.

14:28.875 --> 14:30.625
It doesn't take an hour
to say goodbye.

14:30.625 --> 14:31.958
- Okay. Good night.
- Now.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.042
- Yeah, right now.

14:33.042 --> 14:35.375
Going by my rank
in this scenario

14:35.375 --> 14:36.792
and my rapport with Lee,

14:36.792 --> 14:39.708
I do think Lee is
treating me unfairly.

14:39.708 --> 14:42.750
He wants James off the boat,
and he wants me in bed now.

14:42.750 --> 14:45.250
- Okay, that's what I suspected.
I could tell, you know,

14:45.250 --> 14:47.583
literally in
the pressure cooker.

14:47.583 --> 14:49.250
- But when you're ordered
to go to bed

14:49.250 --> 14:53.167
by an outranking officer,
you go to bed.

14:53.167 --> 14:56.083
- You've done well with Ems.
- Love you, baby.

14:56.083 --> 14:58.500
- You know that, don't you?
- Love you too, Ben.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.917
- All right, you take care.

15:00.917 --> 15:03.292
- Good night, baby.
- Good night.

15:15.542 --> 15:17.417
- I respect Kelley
as the boatswain,

15:17.417 --> 15:18.917
and I feel bad for yelling.

15:18.917 --> 15:20.375
You know, but we don't
need to sit here

15:20.375 --> 15:22.083
and have drama
the rest of the season.

15:22.083 --> 15:24.125
We just need to get over it.

15:26.792 --> 15:28.958
- Dean is a really important
charter guest.

15:28.958 --> 15:31.792
He's polite, but he has
such high standards.

15:31.792 --> 15:33.958
- Oh.
- Just focus on the guests.

15:33.958 --> 15:36.208
This charter's
probably our most important.

15:36.208 --> 15:38.208
- Okay.

15:38.208 --> 15:40.125
- Nico has a lot of growing
to do.

15:40.125 --> 15:41.875
If he yelled at a boss
on any other boat,

15:41.875 --> 15:43.292
he'd probably be fired.

15:43.292 --> 15:45.792
But I know how valuable
he is to me.

15:45.792 --> 15:48.625
It's not worth it.

15:48.625 --> 15:50.792
- Attention all crew.
Provisions have arrived.

15:50.792 --> 15:52.583
- Copy.
If you guys could just put it

15:52.583 --> 15:54.125
on the dining table for me.

15:54.125 --> 15:55.292
- Copy.

15:55.292 --> 15:57.125
- The wall looks good.
- Yeah.

15:57.125 --> 15:58.583
- Take it for a test drive,
captain.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.125
I'll leave you in here.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.583
- Attention all crew.
We've got ten minutes

16:09.583 --> 16:10.625
until guest arrival.

16:10.625 --> 16:11.625
Over.

16:13.083 --> 16:14.958
- It's a lot of fun.

16:14.958 --> 16:16.292
- Okay, we're getting close.

16:18.333 --> 16:20.167
- All right, no shoes
for three days.

16:20.167 --> 16:21.667
- Hello.
- Hi.

16:21.667 --> 16:23.000
- Hey.
- Good to see you again.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.667
- Great to be here.
- Welcome back.

16:24.667 --> 16:25.667
So good to see you.
- Thank you.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.333
- Emily.
- Sierra.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.458
- I'm very good. How are you?
- Good. Thank you.

16:29.458 --> 16:31.167
- These guests
are absolutely gorgeous,

16:31.167 --> 16:32.833
but, you know,
they're a group of gay guys.

16:32.833 --> 16:35.333
Hi. Lauren. Nice to meet you.
Damn it.

16:35.333 --> 16:37.000
- Dean, welcome back.
- Thank you.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.792
- Always a pleasure
to have you on board.

16:38.792 --> 16:40.833
Kate will show you
around the vessel,

16:40.833 --> 16:42.500
and we'll get off the dock
and get started.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.083
- Let's do it.
- All right.

16:44.083 --> 16:45.958
Right this way, guys.
- Thanks.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.125
- Uh-huh.

16:50.125 --> 16:51.292
I'm so excited you're here.

16:51.292 --> 16:53.708
- I'm so excited to be here.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.875
- I think you'll like this boat,
just 'cause it's really open

16:55.875 --> 16:58.375
and airy and bright.

16:58.375 --> 17:00.375
This is your master suite.
- Master suite's great.

17:00.375 --> 17:02.042
- Yeah. The toilet has a remote.

17:02.042 --> 17:06.042
It opens by itself, plays music.
- So fancy.

17:06.042 --> 17:07.542
- These are our two queen rooms.

17:07.542 --> 17:10.042
- All right. Sounds good.
- Yeah.

17:10.042 --> 17:11.875
- Let's go. Bow to stern.

17:11.875 --> 17:14.000
- Once you finish calling out
distances for him,

17:14.000 --> 17:15.375
go change over into swimwear.

17:15.375 --> 17:17.708
- Okay. Copy.
- Bow's clear.

17:17.708 --> 17:20.083
- Stern line's all clear, Cap.
Stern line's all clear.

17:29.708 --> 17:30.708
- I don't like the sun.

17:30.708 --> 17:32.417
I'm gonna start wearing a burka.

17:32.417 --> 17:33.750
- Are you ready for us?

17:33.750 --> 17:35.500
Napkins in laps, come on, guys.

17:38.417 --> 17:40.583
- Ben, so we're about
to turn a corner. Are you okay?

17:40.583 --> 17:43.417
- No. I just spilled
f---ing egg yolk everywhere.

17:43.417 --> 17:46.083
I'm a little nervous
going into this first meal.

17:46.083 --> 17:48.917
We have a history
of nervousness together.

17:48.917 --> 17:51.417
- There is plastic on my food!

17:51.417 --> 17:53.333
- We need to make them
another dish.

17:53.333 --> 17:54.583
- Either way,
the chef should be fired.

17:54.583 --> 17:55.583
- Yeah.

17:55.583 --> 17:58.167
- Every meal has to be perfect.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.667
- Do you mind if I put
the spoon in it already?

18:06.667 --> 18:08.000
- Yeah, I'll try and do it,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.250
because I'd rather avoid
the caviar.

18:10.250 --> 18:13.958
- Ben has a very sensitive
relationship with Dean,

18:13.958 --> 18:17.083
because Dean's the one person
that holds him accountable.

18:17.083 --> 18:19.292
So right here have
just an amuse.

18:19.292 --> 18:22.917
It's egg salad
with bowfin caviar. Enjoy.

18:22.917 --> 18:24.625
- So, it's basically eggs
with eggs.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.375
- Heck, yeah.
- Eggs with eggs.

18:28.292 --> 18:30.125
- Kate, how are they?

18:30.125 --> 18:31.958
Did they like the caviar thing?

18:31.958 --> 18:34.583
- Dean was very funny. He said,
"Oh, it's eggs with eggs."

18:34.583 --> 18:37.458
- What does that mean?

18:37.458 --> 18:38.958
- A tragic story.

18:40.417 --> 18:42.958
- Look at his--
send it back.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.792
- Watch the bow, please.
God damn it!

18:48.792 --> 18:50.125
I expected us
to be further along

18:50.125 --> 18:51.458
this far into the season.

18:51.458 --> 18:53.708
I'm gonna make
some alterations.

18:57.708 --> 18:58.542
- Have you finished, then?

18:58.208 --> 18:58.542
- Yeah, I'm done.

19:01.167 --> 19:03.167
- Can you imagine life
without butter?

19:03.167 --> 19:05.167
That would be harsh.

19:05.167 --> 19:06.167
Brilliant.

19:06.167 --> 19:07.333
The chef position,

19:07.333 --> 19:09.000
out of every position,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.500
you know, our time frames are
really tough.

19:11.500 --> 19:12.917
We have too much to do.

19:12.917 --> 19:16.500
I dare you to walk a day
in my shoes.

19:16.500 --> 19:19.458
- Ooh.
- First we have airline chicken

19:19.458 --> 19:21.500
with an apple
whole-grain coleslaw.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.083
- Sounds good. Thank you.

19:25.917 --> 19:28.833
- Is Dean seeming to be happy?
- He hasn't talked.

19:28.833 --> 19:30.792
He was just busy chewing.
- F---.

19:30.792 --> 19:32.500
- Kelley, Kelley, Lee.
- Go for Kelley.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.875
- Now would be a good time
for the toys and the slide.

19:34.875 --> 19:36.083
- Roger that.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.208
- Tonight we're doing
Chinese New Year party.

19:43.208 --> 19:44.708
Are you interested
at all in doing,

19:44.708 --> 19:46.875
like, a Chinese cuisine?

19:46.875 --> 19:48.542
- Yeah.

19:48.542 --> 19:50.375
- Kate? Is Chef Ben busy?
Is he still working?

19:50.375 --> 19:52.708
- No.
- I would like to speak to him.

19:52.708 --> 19:54.375
- Hey, Ben.
Dean's in the main salon,

19:54.375 --> 19:56.875
would love to chat with you.

19:56.875 --> 19:59.500
- Sure.
- Ben, how are you?

19:59.500 --> 20:00.708
- Hey.
- I wasn't thrilled to see you

20:00.708 --> 20:02.625
when I got on board.

20:02.625 --> 20:04.375
- I'm sorry, Dean,
but I'm not that thrilled

20:04.375 --> 20:07.708
to see you either, so.

20:07.708 --> 20:09.208
- Lunch--

20:09.208 --> 20:11.708
it was amazing.
- Oh, well, thank you.

20:11.708 --> 20:14.542
- And so I want to apologize
for doubting you at all.

20:14.542 --> 20:16.500
Everything was so good.
- Oh, good, cool.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.583
- So now you've really got a lot
to live up to now,

20:18.583 --> 20:20.333
because the first meal you do
is just--

20:20.333 --> 20:21.833
- That's not very fair, though.
Now, I'm kidding.

20:21.833 --> 20:23.000
- No, I'm not fair,
I'm never fair.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.583
- I'm joking, I'm joking.

20:24.583 --> 20:26.583
I set the bar high,
and he expects me

20:26.583 --> 20:28.167
to keep it that high.

20:28.167 --> 20:29.750
It's Dean's world,

20:29.750 --> 20:31.417
and we're just lucky
to be living in it.

20:31.417 --> 20:34.333
- You made my day. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:34.333 --> 20:35.750
- Oh, I love that there's
no women

20:35.750 --> 20:38.750
and no lipstick
to scrub off the glasses.

20:38.750 --> 20:40.042
- Mm-hmm. That's so funny.

20:40.042 --> 20:41.542
- Hey, Emily?
- Yeah?

20:41.542 --> 20:43.500
- Listen, I would like
to take my break now,

20:43.500 --> 20:45.833
so clear up lunch, stay
kind of on guest service...

20:45.833 --> 20:47.000
- Yeah.
- And I'll be back.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.333
- Okay.

20:48.333 --> 20:50.375
- The little things, eh?
- I know.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.833
- Whoo!

20:55.208 --> 20:56.667
- Oh!

20:58.292 --> 21:12.083
- I totally get
how dolphins feel.

21:12.083 --> 21:13.292
- Th

21:13.292 --> 21:15.458
is going on around here?

21:15.458 --> 21:18.958
- Can we get some service out
here on the aft deck, please?

21:18.958 --> 21:20.583
- They don't make them
like they used to.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.250
- No, they do not.

21:23.792 --> 21:27.292
- Kate, Kate, Lee.
- Copy.

21:27.292 --> 21:28.792
- Can I trust anyone?

21:32.875 --> 21:34.958
- I can't even leave
for five minutes

21:34.958 --> 21:38.292
before our boss is calling
for service

21:38.292 --> 21:43.167
for our most high-maintenance
charter guest.

21:43.167 --> 21:44.583
- Can I just do
a skinny girl margarita?

21:44.583 --> 21:46.083
- Yeah.
It's completely unfair,

21:46.083 --> 21:48.167
and I don't have time
to worry about it,

21:48.167 --> 21:49.667
so I'll just do the work myself.

21:49.667 --> 21:51.167
Will one of you please
go get the blender

21:51.167 --> 21:52.667
from the pantry upstairs?

21:52.667 --> 21:54.000
- I'll grab it.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.167
- Work it. Smile.
- There you go.

21:56.167 --> 21:57.917
There you go. One more.
- There you go.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.167
- Kelley, I need you to go
pick up a load of fireworks.

22:00.167 --> 22:01.958
- Roger. En route.
- Kelley?

22:01.958 --> 22:03.417
Can you pick up the flowers

22:03.417 --> 22:04.625
I ordered for Emily
while you're out?

22:04.625 --> 22:06.083
- Yeah.

22:12.917 --> 22:14.417
- Okay, let's go ahead
and bring this up,

22:14.417 --> 22:15.833
'cause it's 5:31.

22:15.833 --> 22:17.083
- All right.

22:17.083 --> 22:19.167
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

22:19.167 --> 22:20.500
- I like a little bit
of charcuterie.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.458
- Oh, hummus.
- Excellent.

22:22.458 --> 22:25.000
- Cheers, everyone.
- Cheers.

22:29.208 --> 22:31.042
- I wish I could take
a break, but I can't.

22:31.042 --> 22:34.042
Captain Lee's calling me
the moment I go on break

22:34.042 --> 22:35.208
for service.

22:35.208 --> 22:37.375
I know, baby, I know.

22:37.375 --> 22:39.042
- Yeah. You don't know.

22:39.042 --> 22:41.042
Your girlfriend, like,
you distract her too much

22:41.042 --> 22:42.208
or something.

22:42.208 --> 22:43.958
- What?
- I am disappointed,

22:43.958 --> 22:47.542
because I told Emily
stay on service.

22:47.542 --> 22:49.833
- Do you expect her
to just stand in front of them

22:49.833 --> 22:51.125
all day long?

22:51.125 --> 22:53.042
Is that what service is
on a yacht?

22:53.042 --> 22:57.542
Hands down, Emily is the best
second stew Kate's ever had.

22:57.542 --> 23:00.500
She basically runs
the whole boat.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.542
- You know, Ben, if you weren't
romantically involved

23:02.542 --> 23:04.417
with Emily, I don't think
you would get involved

23:04.417 --> 23:06.583
with the interior workings.

23:06.583 --> 23:08.417
- You're blaming me
at the same time.

23:08.417 --> 23:10.042
- I'm not blaming anyone.

23:10.042 --> 23:12.375
- It sounded a lot like you were
blaming me and Ems.

23:15.042 --> 23:16.583
- Just give her the flowers.
You stay out.

23:16.583 --> 23:18.083
I've got to get off this dock.

23:18.083 --> 23:20.250
All right, just set them
right here next to me.

23:20.250 --> 23:22.375
- Those don't look
like fireworks, Kelley.

23:22.375 --> 23:24.250
- No, they don't.

23:24.250 --> 23:26.917
- Be sure you fill me in when
you get back on what they are.

23:26.917 --> 23:30.542
- Emily, happy birthday.
But Ben, what the f---?

23:31.667 --> 23:33.750
- Watch the bow, please.

23:33.750 --> 23:35.750
God damn it!

23:35.750 --> 23:39.750
Did you not hear me when
I said watch the bow, please?

23:39.750 --> 23:42.083
Obviously not.
F---.

23:42.083 --> 23:44.917
- Flowers.
Don't let Emily see those.

23:44.917 --> 23:46.250
It's heavy.

23:53.625 --> 23:56.542
- I'm always trying to one-up
myself to surprise Dean.

23:56.542 --> 23:58.958
So I'm gonna try and push
my creative boundaries

23:58.958 --> 24:01.333
with tonight's
Chinese New Year-themed dinner.

24:03.750 --> 24:05.958
- Hello, you.
- Hello.

24:05.958 --> 24:09.083
- We're gonna get loose, baby.
Ugh!

24:09.083 --> 24:10.708
- Hey, Emily?

24:10.708 --> 24:13.417
The Chinese New Year party is
kind of a big deal.

24:13.417 --> 24:14.708
I have to focus.

24:14.708 --> 24:16.125
So if you'll just run up
to the bow

24:16.125 --> 24:17.792
and see if the guests are okay
real quick.

24:17.792 --> 24:19.958
- Yeah. Okay, I'll be quick.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.750
- Kelley, come on up
to the wheelhouse.

24:23.750 --> 24:25.583
- Roger that.
I'm on my way up now.

24:30.417 --> 24:33.333
- Who the f--- died?
- Nobody.

24:33.333 --> 24:36.000
Ben got those for Emily
for her birthday tomorrow.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.417
- Well, I could give
a flying sh--

24:37.417 --> 24:39.000
about the goddamn flowers.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
We're on charter.
I expected us to be

24:41.000 --> 24:44.333
further along
this far into the season.

24:44.333 --> 24:47.167
He's got the fireworks.
He's got a big vase of flowers.

24:47.167 --> 24:49.333
And then he smacks the boat
with the tender.

24:49.333 --> 24:51.833
I mean, he's just everywhere.
I don't know what he's thinking.

24:51.833 --> 24:54.833
I think I'm gonna make
some alterations.

24:54.833 --> 24:56.417
Let me think on it.

24:56.417 --> 24:58.833
- Sounds good.
- Kelley was given a second shot

24:58.833 --> 25:01.833
at redemption, but I haven't
seen any improvement.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.542
Something's got to happen.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.708
- Can I get a deckhand to help
me out in the galley, please?

25:09.708 --> 25:11.625
- Copy.

25:11.625 --> 25:13.292
- Kate's been, like,
putting me on things

25:13.292 --> 25:15.333
that she wouldn't usually,
and stopping me midway

25:15.333 --> 25:16.375
and then going,
"No, now do this.

25:16.375 --> 25:17.667
No, now do this."

25:17.667 --> 25:18.875
Like I feel like
I'm annoying her.

25:18.875 --> 25:20.083
- Yeah.

25:21.708 --> 25:23.833
- You think it's because of Ben?
- Yeah.

25:23.833 --> 25:25.333
- Have you talked
to Ben about it?

25:25.333 --> 25:27.042
- No, I'm going to.
I'm gonna ask.

25:27.042 --> 25:28.542
- You should.

25:31.375 --> 25:34.500
- Daddy's here.
- Oh, good.

25:36.708 --> 25:38.875
- It may be a hard time
to, like, ask or whatever,

25:38.875 --> 25:40.458
like, 'cause I know
we're really busy,

25:40.458 --> 25:42.542
but are you okay
with everything with me?

25:42.542 --> 25:44.125
- Why do you ask?

25:44.125 --> 25:46.042
- 'Cause earlier I felt
like maybe you were

25:46.042 --> 25:47.542
getting annoyed with me,
and I just wanted to--

25:47.542 --> 25:50.167
- I was frustrated
that Captain had to call

25:50.167 --> 25:52.333
over the radio for service.

25:52.333 --> 25:55.542
That's why I came back up,
and it was fine.

25:55.542 --> 25:57.000
- Okay.

26:09.333 --> 26:10.542
- Guys, you want to come out
to dinner?

26:10.542 --> 26:11.667
- Yeah.
- We're gonna celebrate

26:11.667 --> 26:13.250
Year of the Dog today.
- Yeah.

26:13.250 --> 26:16.542
- A little Chinese New Year
celebration.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.083
- Good job, Nico.
- They're ready.

26:18.083 --> 26:20.583
- Soft shell crab,
and avocado, corn.

26:20.583 --> 26:23.750
- It's Asian guacamole.
- Ooh!

26:23.750 --> 26:25.917
- To the year of the dog.
- To the year of the dog.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.417
- I'm a fish.
- Cheers.

26:27.417 --> 26:29.750
- So what we have here is
soft shell crab

26:29.750 --> 26:31.458
with an Asian guacamole.

26:31.458 --> 26:33.292
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.292
- I love soft shell crab.
- I do too.

26:35.292 --> 26:36.958
- So what do you think, Dean?

26:36.958 --> 26:38.292
- This is really good.

26:39.958 --> 26:41.083
- Did they like it?

26:41.083 --> 26:42.458
- They loved it.
- Dean?

26:42.458 --> 26:44.083
- Yeah, he liked it.
- All right. Cool.

26:44.083 --> 26:45.583
I'm on another level tonight.

26:48.458 --> 26:50.292
- Hi.
- Hey.

26:52.917 --> 26:54.625
- That is hot.

26:57.458 --> 26:59.042
- We'll have to do
a big Vegas night.

26:59.042 --> 27:01.625
- Oh, I know that you never--
- I am never there.

27:01.625 --> 27:04.083
- If a chef made me this,
I'd go and kiss him.

27:06.125 --> 27:09.292
- Duck, shrimp hot noodle soup?
- Yeah.

27:09.292 --> 27:11.458
- Okay.
- These dinners are insane.

27:11.458 --> 27:13.333
- Really amazing.
- Nice job, Ben.

27:13.333 --> 27:14.833
- Appreciate it.

27:14.833 --> 27:17.958
- Here we have a shrimp and duck
hot noodle soup

27:17.958 --> 27:20.292
with porcini mushrooms.
- Excellent.

27:20.292 --> 27:22.292
- Thank you.
- It's an amazing dish.

27:25.625 --> 27:27.500
- This is difficult to eat.
I can't.

27:32.292 --> 27:35.667
- What do you think, Dean?

27:35.667 --> 27:37.500
- It doesn't have
a lot of flavor to it.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.000
- Do you need something else?

27:39.000 --> 27:40.333
- Were there flavor options?
- Yeah.

27:40.333 --> 27:42.792
- Can we add some flavor?
- Really? Okay.

27:42.792 --> 27:44.292
- Yeah, looks beautiful.
No flavor.

27:44.292 --> 27:48.000
- Let me see if he has
some nice duck sauce.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.625
- Can I have the salt?
- Salt helps a lot.

27:49.625 --> 27:52.083
- Does it?

27:52.083 --> 27:53.500
- Ben?
- Yeah, yeah?

27:53.500 --> 27:55.208
- Right now I need you to focus
on something

27:55.208 --> 27:56.542
to add to this broth.

27:56.542 --> 27:58.375
- Why?
- They all are saying it has

27:58.375 --> 27:59.750
not a lot of flavor.

28:03.042 --> 28:05.042
- F---.
I've never had a guest

28:05.042 --> 28:06.542
not like a dish of mine ever,

28:06.542 --> 28:08.375
and it's f---ing Dean,
of all people.

28:08.375 --> 28:10.125
- Ben, don't spin out.

28:10.125 --> 28:11.167
- But I think that with, like...

28:15.042 --> 28:17.833
- Hi. I'm so sorry. Um.
- It looks amazing.

28:17.833 --> 28:19.667
I love duck,
and it just didn't have--

28:19.667 --> 28:21.375
didn't have a lot of flavor.

28:21.375 --> 28:23.000
- Okay, I'll make you
anything you want right now.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.917
- No--seriously, no.

28:29.167 --> 28:30.792
- Holy smokes.

28:33.042 --> 28:36.042
- They're the best flowers
I've ever seen, I think.

28:36.042 --> 28:38.542
Happy birthday.

28:38.542 --> 28:40.208
- Em?
- Yes?

28:40.208 --> 28:41.792
- Can I see you for a moment?

28:45.792 --> 28:46.500
- I love duck.

28:46.083 --> 28:46.500
It just didn't have--

28:48.042 --> 28:49.333
didn't have a lot of flavor.

28:49.333 --> 28:50.417
- Do you want me to remove it
for you?

28:50.417 --> 28:51.917
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

28:51.917 --> 28:55.917
Out of over 100,000 dishes
I've ever done,

28:55.917 --> 28:59.625
it's the only dish
that has ever been sent back.

29:01.917 --> 29:03.917
F---. He's right.

29:03.917 --> 29:06.417
I put the ice in to stop
the shrimp from cooking,

29:06.417 --> 29:08.208
and the ice diluted it.

29:11.917 --> 29:15.208
Oh, my God.

29:15.208 --> 29:17.750
- What the f---?
- I can't believe I did that.

29:17.750 --> 29:19.458
It's so unlike me.

29:19.458 --> 29:22.208
I just f---ed up,
'cause I'm a f---ing idiot.

29:22.208 --> 29:23.958
- Oh, my God!

29:25.792 --> 29:28.125
- It's all right, man.
- I'm a f---ing dickhead.

29:28.125 --> 29:29.625
- Don't beat yourself
over it.

29:29.625 --> 29:31.958
Just drop it
and get on with dessert.

29:31.958 --> 29:33.583
- Oh, my God.
- I heard the splash

29:33.583 --> 29:36.208
going for so long.

29:36.208 --> 29:38.375
- I'm gonna puke. You know
when you get that feeling?

29:38.375 --> 29:40.292
- I know. I know what you mean.
- Sierra just spilled broth

29:40.292 --> 29:41.625
down the dining salon.

29:41.625 --> 29:43.083
Sh-- happens.

29:43.083 --> 29:44.417
Let's focus on dessert.

29:48.875 --> 29:50.625
- Yo, what's up?
- You good?

29:50.625 --> 29:54.917
- Yeah. Reading, trying to leave
this place for a little bit.

29:54.917 --> 29:56.292
- What do you need?

29:56.292 --> 29:57.625
- I'll let you know
in the morning

29:57.625 --> 29:58.958
after I have my talk
with the captain.

29:58.958 --> 30:01.000
Supposedly some changes
are happening.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.417
I don't know what they are yet.

30:02.417 --> 30:03.750
I'll let you know
as soon as I know.

30:03.750 --> 30:04.750
- Do you want me to leave you
to it?

30:04.750 --> 30:05.958
- Yeah.
- All right.

30:05.958 --> 30:07.292
- Thanks, bud.

30:07.292 --> 30:09.125
- I'll talk to you in a bit.
- Okay.

30:13.750 --> 30:16.625
- Apple turnover with chocolate,
vanilla, and hazelnut?

30:16.625 --> 30:18.333
- Yeah.

30:18.333 --> 30:20.833
- How's the puppy doing?
- He's a bit thirsty.

30:20.833 --> 30:23.167
- He's thirsty.

30:23.167 --> 30:25.083
- Surprise.
Ding-a-ling-a-ling.

30:25.083 --> 30:27.667
- Aww.
- Oh, thank you.

30:27.667 --> 30:29.667
- Apple strudel?
- Wow.

30:29.667 --> 30:32.083
- Mmm.
- Wow, so good.

30:32.083 --> 30:33.667
- How's the dessert?
Is it all right?

30:33.667 --> 30:35.458
- Very good.
- Good.

30:35.458 --> 30:38.792
It may seem like Dean is the
only one that got a sparkler.

30:38.792 --> 30:41.042
But that's not the case.

30:41.042 --> 30:42.500
Go.

30:42.500 --> 30:43.500
Surprise!

30:43.500 --> 30:45.375
- Whoo!

30:47.875 --> 30:52.375
- Get out of here!

30:52.375 --> 30:53.542
- Ben, there's fireworks
happening,

30:53.542 --> 30:54.833
and they're still pretty much

30:54.833 --> 30:56.542
just as excited
about the dessert.

30:56.542 --> 30:59.833
They said, "Wow, the chef
made such an amazing dessert."

30:59.833 --> 31:01.000
- Awesome.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.917
Oh!

31:05.833 --> 31:07.542
- Wow.

31:11.042 --> 31:12.875
- Good night, everyone.
- Good night, Dean.

31:12.875 --> 31:14.250
- Good night, Dean. Thank you.

31:17.958 --> 31:19.500
- Going to sleep, love?
- In a moment.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.875
- All right. Good night.

31:21.875 --> 31:24.375
Cheers.

31:24.375 --> 31:26.083
Tonight was harrowing,

31:26.083 --> 31:30.167
but Emily seems
to alleviate all of it.

31:30.167 --> 31:33.833
- See you in the morning.
- Yep, you will.

31:33.833 --> 31:35.750
- Kelley tell you
about the meeting tomorrow?

31:35.750 --> 31:36.875
- What meeting?

31:44.250 --> 31:47.375
- Kelley's not the most amazing
boatswain I've ever had,

31:47.375 --> 31:51.917
but hasn't done anything
that's that f---ed up, yet.

31:51.917 --> 31:53.500
- I'm gonna go
sort this sh-- out.

31:53.500 --> 31:55.917
I'll catch you in the morning.
Get some rest.

31:55.917 --> 31:57.208
- All right.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.750
- Holy smokes.

32:01.542 --> 32:04.750
Whoa. Holy sh--.

32:04.750 --> 32:06.958
This is next level.

32:06.958 --> 32:10.292
These flowers for Emily,
they are absolutely amazing.

32:10.292 --> 32:11.917
I love the composition.

32:11.917 --> 32:14.417
They're the best flowers
I've ever seen, I think.

32:14.417 --> 32:16.125
- Dude, this is sick.

32:16.125 --> 32:17.958
Like, the blue and the lily.

32:17.958 --> 32:19.250
Ben, you did awesome.

32:20.958 --> 32:23.208
- I think Ben's huge mess-up
with the soup is

32:23.208 --> 32:26.708
because he was super distracted
by Emily's birthday flowers

32:26.708 --> 32:28.208
and fighting with me,

32:28.208 --> 32:31.458
and he just didn't
stay professional.

32:31.458 --> 32:33.250
- Can I ask you something?

32:33.250 --> 32:34.750
Should I take the flowers
in the main salon?

32:34.750 --> 32:36.583
- I don't want
to get involved anymore.

32:36.583 --> 32:38.042
- What?

32:38.042 --> 32:39.208
- I really don't want
to get involved

32:39.208 --> 32:42.125
with your dating life anymore.

32:42.125 --> 32:43.792
- I'll be in a great mood.

32:43.792 --> 32:45.458
Kate will walk in
like a dark cloud

32:45.458 --> 32:47.458
and just kill it.

32:47.458 --> 32:51.125
Yeah, whatever, babe. You can't
bring me down right now.

32:51.125 --> 32:52.667
Nice.

32:52.667 --> 32:55.167
- So, yeah,
I'm super stoked for Em, though.

32:55.167 --> 32:57.292
- Birthdays on a yacht can be
tough,

32:57.292 --> 32:59.250
so on this boat I've tried
to, like,

32:59.250 --> 33:02.167
make Emily's birthday feel
really special.

33:02.167 --> 33:04.125
She's gonna freak out.

33:20.833 --> 33:23.042
- Oh, my God.

33:26.792 --> 33:29.708
I was not expecting a gift
like this from Ben.

33:29.708 --> 33:31.208
Oh, wow.

33:31.208 --> 33:34.458
I am overly shocked.

33:34.458 --> 33:35.542
- Oh my God, who's that from?

33:35.542 --> 33:37.708
- Ben.
- Are you serious?

33:37.708 --> 33:39.458
- I just don't know
what to do with it.

33:41.958 --> 33:45.208
- Kelley, Kelley, it's Lee.
- Go for Kelley.

33:45.208 --> 33:46.500
- Yeah, can I get you up
in the wheelhouse

33:46.500 --> 33:48.292
for just a quick second?

33:49.875 --> 33:52.958
Everybody's gonna mess up
at one point or another.

33:52.958 --> 33:55.042
It's not the mess up.
It's how you recover from it

33:55.042 --> 33:57.958
and how you deal with it.

33:57.958 --> 33:59.500
- Morning.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.958
Do you want to talk
about yesterday?

34:03.958 --> 34:07.125
- Didn't seem like it was
an exceptionally good day to me.

34:07.125 --> 34:10.583
- Thought it was good
up until the "Intrepid."

34:10.583 --> 34:12.750
- That was pretty f---ing lame.

34:18.833 --> 34:20.250
- F---.

34:20.250 --> 34:22.083
Hey, Cap, it's Kelley.

34:22.083 --> 34:23.875
We have a mishap.

34:28.417 --> 34:29.417
- Didn't seem like it was

34:28.917 --> 34:29.417
an exceptionally good day to me.

34:31.417 --> 34:35.042
- Thought it was good
up until the "Intrepid."

34:35.042 --> 34:37.750
- That was pretty f---ing lame.

34:37.750 --> 34:41.750
It's just--I don't know.

34:41.750 --> 34:44.250
I'm not
where I want to be yet.

34:44.250 --> 34:47.250
I'm gonna give Kelley one more
shot to demonstrate to me

34:47.250 --> 34:49.042
the ability
to step up to the plate.

34:49.042 --> 34:52.083
I want you to take Nico
and escort Dean to the baths.

34:52.083 --> 34:54.292
I can babysit Moe and Larry.

34:54.292 --> 34:57.208
Roger that.

34:57.208 --> 34:59.208
A special thank you to whoever
made Captain Lee's coffee

34:59.208 --> 35:00.417
this morning.

35:00.417 --> 35:02.083
I was expecting an ass-chewing,

35:02.083 --> 35:04.500
and now I'm getting
to take guests to the baths.

35:10.958 --> 35:13.292
- Is your coffee okay?
- Yes, mine is.

35:13.292 --> 35:14.417
- Okay, fabulous.

35:17.042 --> 35:18.292
- Good morning.

35:18.292 --> 35:19.458
- Have you been
to the baths before?

35:19.458 --> 35:21.292
- Never.
- Oh, get excited.

35:22.875 --> 35:25.125
- The birthday girl.
- Good morning.

35:25.125 --> 35:27.458
- How you doing?
- Hello.

35:27.458 --> 35:28.833
How's it going?
- Thank you so much.

35:35.083 --> 35:36.667
Amazing.

35:36.667 --> 35:38.000
You made me so happy.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.750
- Hey, Em?
- Yes?

35:39.750 --> 35:42.333
- Could I see you
for a moment?

35:42.333 --> 35:44.958
These must be for you.
- Yes.

35:44.958 --> 35:47.167
- We need to put them somewhere
other than here. We need to--

35:47.167 --> 35:51.125
- Mess table?
- Yeah. Thanks, Em.

35:51.125 --> 35:52.958
- Captain's request.

35:54.292 --> 35:56.333
- Do you need a hand?
- Maybe.

35:56.333 --> 35:58.250
- Let me just do it.

35:58.250 --> 35:59.708
Ah.

36:02.500 --> 36:05.000
- You good, brah?
- All good, brother.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
- We need to start
prepping snorkel gear.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.333
Captain is sending me and Nico
to the baths.

36:09.333 --> 36:11.417
- All right.
- It's a good day.

36:11.417 --> 36:13.000
It's going to be a good day.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.250
- Yeah.

36:18.708 --> 36:20.792
- Mmm.
- Excellent.

36:20.792 --> 36:22.708
- How's breakfast?
- Very good.

36:22.708 --> 36:24.292
- Good, good.
Whenever y'all are done,

36:24.292 --> 36:26.292
we'll be ready
on the swim platform for you,

36:26.292 --> 36:27.958
so we can start
the baths experience.

36:27.958 --> 36:29.208
- All right.

36:33.042 --> 36:34.875
- Hey, Dean.
- They're leaving now.

36:34.875 --> 36:36.708
- Does everybody
have shoes with them?

36:36.708 --> 36:39.042
- All clear. All the guests are
off the boat in the "Intrepid."

36:39.042 --> 36:41.333
- Copy.
- Here we go.

36:44.708 --> 36:47.208
- I had a quick word
with Kate last night.

36:47.208 --> 36:49.500
- And what?
- About the captain having

36:49.500 --> 36:51.500
to ask for guest service
on the aft deck.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.042
I was kind of like--

36:53.042 --> 36:54.792
- We got into it a little bit.

36:54.792 --> 36:57.833
She said it was because you were
in here chatting with me.

36:57.833 --> 37:00.208
- I'm here to do my job and work
well with both of them,

37:00.208 --> 37:02.583
and I don't want to get involved
in problems that they have.

37:02.583 --> 37:05.167
- All we can do right now is
the best frickin' job

37:05.167 --> 37:06.875
we can for today.

37:10.417 --> 37:12.042
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you.

37:12.042 --> 37:13.208
- You're welcome.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.333
- Okay.

37:15.333 --> 37:16.708
- Let's do this.

37:18.083 --> 37:20.917
- All right.

37:20.917 --> 37:23.583
- Coming back, we come all
the way back on a taxi, too?

37:23.583 --> 37:25.667
- Yeah, it's like
an hour taxi ride.

37:25.667 --> 37:27.833
- Right. Ugh.
No, homie don't play that.

37:27.833 --> 37:29.083
- What? Homie don't play that?

37:29.083 --> 37:30.750
- Homie don't play that.

37:30.750 --> 37:32.833
So, coming back, you guys
can take all the stuff back,

37:32.833 --> 37:34.750
and we'll swim out
past the buoys, pick us up?

37:34.750 --> 37:36.250
- Mm-hmm.

37:36.250 --> 37:37.750
Dean's throwing me
a curve ball.

37:37.750 --> 37:39.458
He doesn't want
to take the taxi ride back.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.375
- Here we are.
- So instead of them

37:41.375 --> 37:42.958
hopping in the taxi ride,

37:42.958 --> 37:44.458
I'm gonna bring the tender
to the beach.

37:44.458 --> 37:46.042
They're gonna swim out
to the boat,

37:46.042 --> 37:47.125
and then I'm gonna take them
to the yacht,

37:47.125 --> 37:48.458
and then problem solved.

37:48.458 --> 37:49.792
I'm gonna go follow them in.

37:49.792 --> 37:51.542
- I'll hang out,
set everything up.

37:51.542 --> 37:54.417
- Thanks so much, Nico.
- Yeah, man.

37:54.417 --> 37:57.250
- It's so good.
It feels so disconnected

37:57.250 --> 37:58.958
from the world,
because of the beautiful water.

37:58.958 --> 38:01.292
- Right. Oh, that's cool.

38:01.292 --> 38:02.750
- Right?

38:05.875 --> 38:08.292
- Three, two, one.

38:08.292 --> 38:09.875
All right, cool.

38:12.625 --> 38:14.417
- It's really cool.

38:24.792 --> 38:26.500
- Ashley, how are you doing?
- Fine. How are you?'ve been seeing on and off

38:26.500 --> 38:29.667
for a couple of years,
and is an amazing person.

38:29.667 --> 38:31.500
I didn't realize how much
I was gonna miss Ashley

38:31.500 --> 38:32.667
until I got here.

38:32.667 --> 38:34.042
Are you okay, though?
- Yeah.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.750
- I'll sort something out
for you, okay?

38:54.750 --> 38:55.792
- Okay.

38:56.833 --> 38:59.500
- Okay, I love you. Bye.
- Bye.

38:59.500 --> 39:00.833
- What's the plan here?

39:00.833 --> 39:02.042
- Let me radio Captain Lee
real quick.

39:02.042 --> 39:03.625
Captain Lee,
Captain Lee, Kelley.

39:03.625 --> 39:05.708
- Go, Kelley.
- We're packing up the stuff

39:05.708 --> 39:08.375
and taking it up to the taxi.

39:08.375 --> 39:09.875
Do you want me to leave Nico,

39:09.875 --> 39:11.208
send him over
to the far end of the baths,

39:11.208 --> 39:12.833
and just have him swim out
with the guests?

39:14.542 --> 39:15.833
- Awesome. Once we get the
stuff up to the taxi,

39:15.833 --> 39:17.375
I'll send them that way.

39:17.375 --> 39:18.875
Dean doesn't want to take
an hour taxi ride,

39:18.875 --> 39:21.208
and, you know,
whatever he wants, he gets.

39:21.208 --> 39:22.708
- Thank you.
- Surprised he didn't

39:22.708 --> 39:23.708
give us any grief.

39:23.708 --> 39:25.333
Seems to be in a better mood.

39:25.333 --> 39:26.875
- He woke up on the right side
of the bed today.

39:26.875 --> 39:28.042
- I want to make sure
that me and you are good,

39:28.042 --> 39:29.375
from, you know, the other day.

39:29.375 --> 39:30.833
We're good
from that, right?

39:30.833 --> 39:32.500
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.
- All right.

39:32.500 --> 39:33.542
- I don't hold grudges, man.

39:33.542 --> 39:34.875
- I'm one of five boys,

39:34.875 --> 39:36.625
so we yell at each other
in the moment,

39:36.625 --> 39:38.542
and after the moment's over,
we make up.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.792
And you know, I feel like
I have that bond with Kelley

39:40.792 --> 39:42.292
that we can just do that.

39:42.292 --> 39:45.500
- So, now I'll go back
to the "Intrepid."

39:45.500 --> 39:47.083
- Yeah.
- You go down to the beach.

39:47.083 --> 39:49.708
Give me your radio
so you don't swim with it.

39:49.708 --> 39:51.000
Oh, you're taking
this cooler, right?

39:51.000 --> 39:52.417
By the time you get back
to the beach,

39:52.417 --> 39:53.500
I should be pulling around,
hopefully.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.083
- Okay.
- Get on the far side

39:55.083 --> 39:56.917
of the cove,
hanging out on a rock.

39:56.917 --> 39:58.833
- All right. Good job, man.
- Thanks, man.

39:58.833 --> 40:02.083
Everything today
is going amazingly well.

40:02.083 --> 40:03.958
It's almost scary.

40:13.917 --> 40:15.875
F---.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.542
F---.

40:21.542 --> 40:26.625
I have Nico's radio,
and Nico has the keys.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.333
I'm f---ed.

40:29.917 --> 40:31.125
F---.

40:31.125 --> 40:33.083
After running
back up the hill,

40:33.083 --> 40:35.208
taking the 15-minute taxi ride
back,

40:35.208 --> 40:36.792
I'm gonna make the guests
wait forever.

40:36.792 --> 40:37.917
Or...

40:40.083 --> 40:41.583
Hey, Captain, this is Kelley.

40:52.833 --> 40:53.417
- Is this Captain Lee?

40:53.292 --> 40:53.417
- Yeah.

40:54.708 --> 40:56.292
- Hey, Captain, this is Kelley.

40:56.292 --> 40:58.375
We have a mishap.

40:58.375 --> 41:01.417
We changed coolers
right as we switched--

41:01.417 --> 41:02.792
me and Nico...
- Yeah?

41:02.792 --> 41:04.958
- And he has the keys
to the "Intrepid."

41:04.958 --> 41:07.083
- So you have no way
to get out here.

41:07.083 --> 41:10.000
- No.
- So, you're sitting there,

41:10.000 --> 41:11.125
the guests are sitting there,

41:11.125 --> 41:13.458
and you're calling me.

41:13.458 --> 41:15.917
You just really screwed up.

41:15.917 --> 41:17.583
- I was thinking the RIB
could be put in.

41:17.583 --> 41:19.333
The RIB to the guests,
pick up the guests,

41:19.333 --> 41:21.792
bring them back to the boat,
and then come pick me up.

41:21.792 --> 41:23.292
Well, drop the keys off to me.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.292
- All right, I'll go
pick up Nico at the beach.

41:28.292 --> 41:30.500
So now I have to bail
your ass out,

41:30.500 --> 41:33.167
not because I particularly want
to bail your ass out,

41:33.167 --> 41:37.000
but the guests
need to be bailed out.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.792
I'll work it out,
and I will get back to you.

41:39.792 --> 41:41.333
- All right, thank you, Captain.
- Bye.

41:41.333 --> 41:42.458
- Bye.

41:43.833 --> 41:45.458
- Never a dull moment.

41:47.667 --> 41:50.042
- Where is he?

41:50.042 --> 41:52.500
- I know my ass is
about to be handed to me.

41:52.500 --> 41:55.542
And it might be
for the last time.

41:55.542 --> 41:57.042
- All right,
let's get the RIB in.

41:57.042 --> 41:58.542
Dean's probably
been sitting there,

41:58.542 --> 42:00.625
I don't know how long,
waiting for Kelley.

42:00.625 --> 42:03.000
- Why didn't Kelley leave the
"Intrepid" and go get the keys,

42:03.000 --> 42:04.875
and then go back
in all this time?

42:04.875 --> 42:07.208
- It's quicker to do this.
- Oh, man.

42:07.208 --> 42:08.667
This is a huge mistake.

42:08.667 --> 42:12.875
Especially with Dean.
This is just stupid.

42:12.875 --> 42:14.542
- Do what you can,
and I'll be back.

42:14.542 --> 42:16.833
Everything that could go wrong
is going wrong.

42:16.833 --> 42:18.542
This is a big bad.

42:18.542 --> 42:20.292
We've got charter guests
stuck on a beach

42:20.292 --> 42:22.375
with no way of getting them
off the beach.

42:22.375 --> 42:25.542
I'm terribly disappointed
and pissed.

42:25.542 --> 42:26.792
All of the above.

42:33.917 --> 42:35.250
- Next on "Below Deck"...

42:35.250 --> 42:37.250
- Ashley's on a plane
to Tortola.

42:37.250 --> 42:38.500
- Oh!

42:42.417 --> 42:43.500
- Right.

42:45.208 --> 42:46.917
- Did you have a nice time?

42:46.917 --> 42:49.417
- Kelley and Nico left us
stranded on a beach,

42:49.417 --> 42:52.000
so good times.
- Dean is pissed.

42:52.000 --> 42:56.500
- What I'd like to do is
rip your f---ing head off.

42:56.500 --> 42:58.000
- I'm trying to serve
the guests,

42:58.000 --> 42:59.583
because we're on charter,

42:59.583 --> 43:02.667
but those flowers--
- I want Emily to enjoy them.

43:02.667 --> 43:05.583
- I feel like I'm very much
caught in the middle.

43:05.583 --> 43:08.250
- We had a really nice thing
going on, and--

43:08.250 --> 43:10.042
- And why do we not still?
- I mean, do we?

43:10.042 --> 43:11.417
I don't know.

43:12.917 --> 43:15.917
