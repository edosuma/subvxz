11:35.303 --> 11:37.305
Look, I underestimated
these boys, Lois,

11:37.392 --> 11:39.786
and they deserve to have
a really great Christmas.

11:39.873 --> 11:41.613
How much money do we have?

11:41.701 --> 11:43.528
-Zero.
-No, I mean everything,

11:43.615 --> 11:44.834
credit cards, loose change,
everything?

11:44.921 --> 11:47.315
Oh. Minus $512.

11:47.402 --> 11:50.100
What?! Oh, for God sakes!

11:51.232 --> 11:52.973
Can you think
of a Christmas reason

11:53.060 --> 11:54.931
for stopping somewhere
I can sell blood?

11:55.018 --> 11:56.585
Oh, Hal, don't worry about it.

11:56.672 --> 11:57.673
It'll be okay.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.283
You just need
to find something

11:59.370 --> 12:01.416
that's a thousand
times better than Disneyland,

12:01.503 --> 12:03.810
open on Christmas Day
and free.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.420
Just because it's hard, Lois,

12:05.507 --> 12:06.900
doesn't mean it's impossible.

12:06.987 --> 12:09.206
I am going to
make this happen.

12:09.293 --> 12:11.600
Hal, we don't even have
enough gas to get home.

12:11.687 --> 12:12.906
Yes, we do.

12:12.993 --> 12:14.603
I did all the
calculations, Lois.

12:14.690 --> 12:17.475
We are exactly 40 miles
from the point of no return.

12:17.562 --> 12:20.391
And I promise you
I will figure out
a plan by then.

12:20.478 --> 12:22.524
If not, I will turn
the van around.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.091
Just don't rat me out.

12:25.135 --> 12:26.746
Please, honey.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.617
It's Christmas.

12:28.704 --> 12:31.751
I can't wait much longer.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.883
Mom, is it really going
to be as good as Dad says?

12:36.320 --> 12:38.801
Dewey, I think you'll remember
this day for a long time.

12:38.888 --> 12:44.851
I think we'll all remember
this day for a very long time.

12:46.330 --> 12:49.377
All right,
since no one wants
to race cigarette butts,

12:49.464 --> 12:51.205
I'm outta here.

12:51.292 --> 12:52.684
[sighs]

12:52.772 --> 12:54.469
Francis, I have
to talk to you
about something.

12:54.556 --> 12:57.167
It's weird, but lately
I kind of feel

12:57.254 --> 12:58.603
like I'm being left out
by Reese and Dewey.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.257
Aw, geez.
Look, I'm sorry.

13:00.344 --> 13:01.519
You weren't supposed
to know about the beach trip.

13:01.606 --> 13:03.652
-What?!
-Hey, geez, watch it!

13:03.739 --> 13:05.088
What beach trip?!

13:05.175 --> 13:06.916
I took Reese and Dewey
to the beach last summer.

13:07.003 --> 13:09.049
I would've invited you,
but you were over at Stevie's.

13:09.136 --> 13:10.746
He lives two blocks away!

13:10.833 --> 13:13.662
You have to go by his house
to get to the beach!

13:13.749 --> 13:15.055
Why is this happening?

13:15.142 --> 13:16.883
I'm the brother
everybody likes the best.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.275
What are you
talking about?

13:18.362 --> 13:19.842
I'm the brother
everybody likes best.

13:19.929 --> 13:20.887
I meant of the brothers
who are still at home.

13:20.974 --> 13:22.453
That's Dewey.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.412
What?
Where am I in
the pecking order?

13:24.499 --> 13:26.893
Malcolm, I am not gonna stand
here in a public toilet

13:26.980 --> 13:28.633
and rank me, Dewey,
Reese, Jamie and you

13:28.720 --> 13:31.375
in order of popularity.

13:34.291 --> 13:35.771
So are we getting close?

13:35.858 --> 13:37.120
Now, now.

13:37.207 --> 13:38.513
You're not going
to trick me

13:38.600 --> 13:39.688
into giving it away.

13:39.775 --> 13:41.864
It's a surprise.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.779
[whispering]
Hal, you are five miles

13:43.866 --> 13:45.259
from the point
of no return.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.350
Look, I know we don't talk
about our emotions,

13:49.437 --> 13:50.786
but I don't care anymore.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.570
I'm just going
to lay it out there.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.659
My feelings are hurt.

13:54.746 --> 13:56.139
There, I said it.

13:56.226 --> 13:57.880
They're hurt
because you guys are

13:57.967 --> 13:59.186
systematically excluding me.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.231
Being excluded
is extra hard for me

14:01.318 --> 14:03.277
because I see
all the other places

14:03.364 --> 14:05.192
I don't fit in,
and we're brothers.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.368
I really want us
to be in this together.

14:09.761 --> 14:11.502
What a gasbag.

14:11.589 --> 14:12.547
Your feelings aren't hurt.

14:12.634 --> 14:13.678
Your ego is bruised.

14:13.765 --> 14:15.028
The reason
we exclude you sometimes

14:15.115 --> 14:16.594
is because you're a drag.

14:16.681 --> 14:18.335
You always have
to be the special one.

14:18.422 --> 14:19.380
Even now, this
is all about

14:19.467 --> 14:20.816
how you feel things

14:20.903 --> 14:22.513
more deeply than everyone else.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.254
Look, we love you.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.866
We just need a break from you
every once in a while.

14:30.652 --> 14:32.306
Okay, Hal...

14:32.393 --> 14:33.263
Francis, can I see you up here
for a second, please?

14:33.350 --> 14:34.699
I need your help with the radio.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.181
What are you...?

14:38.268 --> 14:39.661
I need to
borrow $1,800.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.228
I'll pay you back
over the next six years

14:41.315 --> 14:42.925
in monthly payments
of $39.50.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.361
I have no money to give
these boys a Christmas gift

14:44.448 --> 14:46.189
and I'm not even sure
where I'm driving.

14:46.276 --> 14:49.410
I hate to ask you,
but I don't know
what else to do.

14:49.497 --> 14:52.195
I love you.

14:52.282 --> 14:56.112
Well, I guess this is as good
a time as any to tell you.

14:56.199 --> 14:58.419
I got fired from my job.
I am totally broke.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.551
What? You got fired
from the ranch?

15:00.638 --> 15:03.163
It turns out the ATM
I was making all of Otto's

15:03.250 --> 15:05.600
deposits into wasn't an ATM.
So sue me, right?

15:05.687 --> 15:07.471
Anyway, he's suing me.

15:07.558 --> 15:09.082
I don't know
what we're going to do.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.474
You're not moving
back in!

15:10.561 --> 15:11.998
There isn't room enough
in the house!

15:12.085 --> 15:13.347
Besides, Piama doesn't want
to live with us.

15:13.434 --> 15:14.783
Piama doesn't even know
about it.

15:14.870 --> 15:16.524
She thinks I'm on vacation.

15:16.611 --> 15:18.352
I've been acting
like the happiest man

15:18.439 --> 15:20.136
in the world the last few weeks
just to hide it from her.

15:20.223 --> 15:22.269
I have to say, I am a little
disappointed in you, Francis.

15:22.356 --> 15:23.748
You can't hide
something like this

15:23.835 --> 15:24.924
from the ones you love.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.490
Honesty is
the cornerstone

15:26.577 --> 15:28.666
of any healthy
relationship.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.148
Well, I'm sorry
I can't help you.

15:35.412 --> 15:38.328
Okay, Hal,
it's been 40 miles.

15:38.415 --> 15:41.027
We are at the point
of no return.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.944
Hal, turn around.

15:56.390 --> 15:59.480
Ding... ding... ding...

15:59.567 --> 16:02.483
ding... ding...

16:02.570 --> 16:04.920
Let's get out
and stretch our legs.

16:07.575 --> 16:09.142
You coming, Malcolm?

16:09.229 --> 16:11.666
You sure? I might
accidentally talk about myself.

16:11.753 --> 16:13.450
You mean like just now?

16:16.671 --> 16:18.716
Hal, what are
you doing?

16:18.803 --> 16:20.109
I'm buying time.

16:20.196 --> 16:21.415
Look, I don't know
how you got me

16:21.502 --> 16:22.982
to go along with this,
but that's it.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.853
The Christmas lie is over.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.594
60 more seconds, Lois.
You can time me.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.422
I'm not...!

16:28.509 --> 16:29.510
Fine.

16:30.859 --> 16:31.991
[ sighs]

16:32.078 --> 16:34.950
-Whoa! Nice rides.
-Yeah.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.387
The fat lady at the car wash
rides one of these.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.304
Nice going, Dewey!

16:41.391 --> 16:43.480
I wasn't even touching it.
It was you!

16:43.567 --> 16:44.829
What'd you do, man?!

16:46.092 --> 16:47.267
MALCOLM:
Wait, wait!

16:47.354 --> 16:48.659
Those guys didn't do it.

16:48.746 --> 16:50.313
What are you
talking about?

16:50.400 --> 16:51.706
I'm not going to
let these people

16:51.793 --> 16:52.881
take the blame when
they didn't do it.

16:54.839 --> 16:56.363
It was my dad.

16:59.583 --> 17:00.889
He was trying
to teach me a lesson

17:00.976 --> 17:02.630
so I wouldn't grow up
and be like you.

17:08.549 --> 17:10.071
Malcolm, oh, my God,
that was awesome!

17:10.159 --> 17:11.247
-That was so cool!
-Thanks!

17:14.729 --> 17:17.079
Okay, honey,
you've got 20 seconds.

17:20.517 --> 17:22.737
[whining]

17:25.740 --> 17:28.221
Lois, there is going
to be a Christmas!

17:28.308 --> 17:29.570
Hal, no!

17:30.484 --> 17:31.485
Oh, no!

17:31.572 --> 17:32.486
I seem to
have slipped

17:32.573 --> 17:34.227
on an oil stain left here

17:34.314 --> 17:35.967
by a negligent owner
or employee.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.099
Hal!

17:38.883 --> 17:40.450
[Lois screams]

17:40.537 --> 17:41.582
[coughing]

17:41.669 --> 17:42.800
Oh, my God!

17:42.887 --> 17:44.802
Are you okay?

17:46.717 --> 17:49.329
Yes, damn it!

17:49.416 --> 17:50.808
[sighs]
Oh, thank goodness.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.636
I don't have any insurance.

17:52.723 --> 17:54.638
We both dodged a bullet.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.727
After I sweep this up,

17:56.814 --> 18:00.296
you're getting wiper
blades, on the house.

18:00.383 --> 18:02.081
Hal...

18:02.168 --> 18:03.865
You know what?

18:03.952 --> 18:05.649
I saw a trail behind here
that leads up into the hills.

18:05.736 --> 18:07.782
There's probably something
really great up there.

18:07.869 --> 18:10.045
All we need is a few flashlights
to get started.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.394
Hal, it's time for you
to face the boys

18:11.481 --> 18:13.222
and tell them
what's going on.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.137
Hal, they're good boys.

18:15.224 --> 18:17.966
They forgave you for banjo camp;
they'll forgive you for this.

18:18.053 --> 18:19.794
And I will try sharing
the blame with you,

18:19.881 --> 18:22.797
but honey, this has got
your fingerprints all over it.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.059
[ mutters]

18:25.713 --> 18:27.715
You know, you're
a pretty good
brother after all.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.978
Thanks. You look cold.
Take my jacket.

18:30.065 --> 18:31.806
I think I could've
handled those bikers,

18:31.893 --> 18:33.286
but with a baby
and a chick around,

18:33.373 --> 18:35.114
you probably did the
right thing, Malcolm.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.550
Thanks for thinking
of us, Reese.

18:36.637 --> 18:37.594
What's this?

18:37.681 --> 18:38.639
Nothing. Give me that.

18:38.726 --> 18:39.814
It's a credit card receipt

18:39.901 --> 18:41.120
from The Clockworks.

18:41.207 --> 18:42.730
You bought those clocks?

18:42.817 --> 18:44.775
You have a credit card?
Since when?

18:44.862 --> 18:46.734
They sent it to me in the mail
a couple months ago.

18:46.821 --> 18:48.127
They must've thought
I was old enough

18:48.214 --> 18:49.432
after I won
that physics award.

18:49.519 --> 18:50.999
So when I superglued
my eyelids shut,

18:51.086 --> 18:52.305
and I was in the
emergency room,

18:52.392 --> 18:53.654
we could've used
your credit card

18:53.741 --> 18:55.351
instead of having
to call Mom?!

18:55.438 --> 18:56.961
I'm not going to let you
jeopardize my credit rating.

18:57.048 --> 18:57.962
I want to buy
a house someday.

18:58.049 --> 18:59.094
Malcolm, you're a jerk.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.009
Mom, Malcolm has
a credit card,

19:01.096 --> 19:03.054
and he bought you
Christmas presents with it.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.404
What?

19:04.491 --> 19:06.971
Malcolm, you bought
those presents,

19:07.058 --> 19:09.322
after everything
I've been through?

19:09.409 --> 19:11.106
We all worked so hard

19:11.193 --> 19:12.629
to make this
a special Christmas,

19:12.716 --> 19:14.370
and you just took
a cheap shortcut!

19:14.457 --> 19:16.807
Those clocks cost
50 bucks each!

19:16.894 --> 19:19.419
I don't care
what they cost!

19:19.506 --> 19:22.552
This isn't a competition,
Malcolm.

19:22.639 --> 19:26.687
You know, all I really want
from you on Christmas is this!

19:36.697 --> 19:39.003
I forgive you, son.

19:39.090 --> 19:41.180
Okay, everybody,
listen up.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.398
I don't want this
to ruin our trip.

19:42.485 --> 19:44.400
Want to know
where we're going?

19:44.487 --> 19:45.488
ALL:
Yeah.

19:47.838 --> 19:50.319
Snow skiing on Mount Bundy!

19:50.406 --> 19:51.712
[cheering]

19:51.799 --> 19:54.062
DEWEY:
I love Mount Bundy.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.805
[Hal chuckles
nervously]

19:57.892 --> 19:59.763
That's a room
for the night,

19:59.850 --> 20:01.243
ski passes
and equipment rentals.

20:01.330 --> 20:03.071
Will you be putting that
on your credit card?

20:03.158 --> 20:06.727
Let's give
it a shot.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.391
[shrieking]
Oh, yes!

20:18.478 --> 20:20.262
[laughs]
In your face!

20:24.571 --> 20:26.703
Hal, this is the low point,
isn't it?

20:26.790 --> 20:28.575
We're not going to sink
any further, are we?

20:28.662 --> 20:29.880
What are you
talking about?

20:29.967 --> 20:32.535
We've stolen
our son's credit card.

20:32.622 --> 20:34.189
If it weren't for my rage
and your recklessness,

20:34.276 --> 20:35.756
our kids might have
a fighting chance.

20:35.843 --> 20:37.497
Lois, those are
the exact things

20:37.584 --> 20:39.020
that make us
great parents.

20:39.107 --> 20:41.022
If it wasn't for
your anger and
my recklessness,

20:41.109 --> 20:43.459
we wouldn't be on
this amazing ski
vacation, would we?

20:46.462 --> 20:48.856
You know, this just might be
our best Christmas ever.

20:48.943 --> 20:51.119
Francis, I want you
to quit your job.

20:51.206 --> 20:52.903
What?

20:52.990 --> 20:54.340
Ever since we left
on this trip,

20:54.427 --> 20:56.864
you've just seemed
so insanely happy.

20:56.951 --> 20:59.301
I can't let you go
back to that job.

20:59.388 --> 21:01.042
You've got to find
something else to do.

21:01.956 --> 21:03.697
You're right.

21:03.784 --> 21:05.699
You know, in fact, let's
not even go back to that ranch.

21:05.786 --> 21:07.048
I'll call Otto
in the morning,

21:07.135 --> 21:08.876
and if he doesn't
understand, tough.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.878
Okay, so who wants

21:10.965 --> 21:13.272
-some hot chocolate
by the fire, huh?
-Yeah!

21:14.882 --> 21:15.926
Enjoy your stay,
Malcolm.

21:16.013 --> 21:18.233
Thanks.

21:58.012 --> 22:00.928
