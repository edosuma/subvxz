Or the premonition in my dream.

13:20.292 --> 13:23.526
It would be a really big
coincidence if it wasn't, don't
you think?

13:23.626 --> 13:25.375
Shh. I've been waiting for
this for weeks, people.

13:27.125 --> 13:29.567
No, don't do that. They were
just getting to the good part.

13:29.667 --> 13:31.899
Well, rent the video.
We have work that we have to do.

13:31.999 --> 13:35.899
- It is not a video,
it is a soap.
- Leo!

13:35.999 --> 13:39.442
Phoebe thinks that a demon
is causing some anger epidemic.

13:39.542 --> 13:40.651
Give me that remote.

13:40.751 --> 13:42.234
PIPER: Give it.
PHOEBE: See?

13:42.334 --> 13:43.876
See, point positive. Here.

13:45.876 --> 13:48.275
- Hey, anything?
- LEO: Based on what
the Elders said,

13:48.375 --> 13:50.359
I think that your dream
premonition is very real.

13:50.459 --> 13:52.899
- Meaning so is the
Tracer demon.
- What Tracer demon?

13:52.999 --> 13:55.234
And what about the creature?
Do they know about the creature?

13:55.334 --> 13:58.442
- What creature?
- Well, they think
that it's a weird assomnio.

13:58.542 --> 14:01.983
- If that's the case,
you definitely need to save him.
- A weirdo what?

14:02.083 --> 14:07.317
Weird assomnio. It's the
original Latin term for
a sandman.

14:07.417 --> 14:10.317
Wait a minute, like,
"Sandman, bring me a dream"?

14:10.417 --> 14:12.859
One and the same. Only there
isn't just one sandman.

14:12.959 --> 14:14.899
There are many of them,
like angels.

14:14.999 --> 14:16.734
They visit good beings
during their sleep,

14:16.834 --> 14:20.109
sprinkle them with dream dust
so they can dream.

14:20.209 --> 14:22.317
I can't believe they exist.

14:22.417 --> 14:24.899
Not that I should be surprised.

14:24.999 --> 14:27.899
Uh, yeah, but they don't know
what we dream about, do they?

14:27.999 --> 14:30.651
I mean that's all confidential,
clearly, isn't it?

14:30.751 --> 14:34.150
I don't know. But I do know
that they exist on a different
plane,

14:34.250 --> 14:36.526
which means
the only way to find one--

14:36.626 --> 14:38.899
Would be for a Tracer demon
to bring him into our plane.

14:38.999 --> 14:40.899
- And kill him.
- Great.

14:40.999 --> 14:44.275
I don't get it. Why would a
demon be interested in killing
people's dreams?

14:44.375 --> 14:47.317
I mean, they're just
harmless erotic fun.

14:47.417 --> 14:49.417
Did you say "erotic"?

14:51.375 --> 14:53.900
Exotic. I said "exotic."

14:54.000 --> 14:58.899
I don't get exotic dreams.
I just get disturbing ones.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.526
Mine are just scary.
But that's how you work
through stuff, right?

15:01.626 --> 15:03.899
- In your dreams?
- So?

15:03.999 --> 15:05.609
So I think that's why
everyone's been crazy.

15:05.709 --> 15:06.994
They're not dealing with
their subconscious issues

15:07.004 --> 15:08.234
while they're dreaming.

15:08.334 --> 15:10.899
I think I got some
issues to work out.

15:10.999 --> 15:15.442
You said your premonition
took place somewhere where
you used to camp?

15:15.542 --> 15:20.192
- Yeah. North State Campgrounds.
- Well, all right, let's go.

15:20.292 --> 15:21.942
And save our dreams.

15:22.042 --> 15:23.526
Oh, Piper, maybe you should
sit this one out.

15:23.626 --> 15:25.692
Why? Don't you need me
to vanquish the demon?

15:25.792 --> 15:27.025
No, I'll make a potion.

15:27.125 --> 15:29.192
It's just you're not moving
as swiftly as you used to,

15:29.292 --> 15:31.584
- and we might have to run.
- But...

15:33.999 --> 15:37.375
Fine. Do it yourself.

15:40.999 --> 15:43.526
It's been so long.

15:43.626 --> 15:46.025
But I never forgot what it
feels like to be in your arms.

15:46.125 --> 15:48.899
Oh, I missed it!

15:48.999 --> 15:51.626
[OWL HOOTING]

16:06.999 --> 16:09.375
Did you really think
I wouldn't come back for you?

16:12.542 --> 16:14.999
Actually, I was counting on it.

16:17.584 --> 16:19.542
Witches.

16:37.584 --> 16:38.959
Who the hell is that?

16:40.417 --> 16:41.709
[CHAIN SAW ROARING]

16:48.999 --> 16:50.542
[SIGHS]

16:59.667 --> 17:03.899
I'm sorry, I'm just so
surprised that you're real.

17:03.999 --> 17:07.733
Okay, this should keep
our brains going on zero sleep.

17:07.834 --> 17:10.858
Do sandmen even sleep?

17:10.959 --> 17:12.942
Only when our charges
are all awake.

17:13.041 --> 17:15.150
Oh, so basically never.

17:15.250 --> 17:16.818
Okay, can we focus here?

17:16.917 --> 17:19.442
Because we have a demon to
vanquish and a nightmare to deal
with.

17:19.541 --> 17:22.108
And a baby shower to get to.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.233
What? I'm just saying.

17:24.334 --> 17:26.150
Any idea how Phoebe's
nightmare came to life?

17:26.250 --> 17:28.899
Well, no.
It's never happened before.

17:28.999 --> 17:33.234
But no one's ever been hit
with that much dream dust
before either.

17:33.334 --> 17:34.942
So you think,
since she OD'd on the stuff,

17:35.042 --> 17:37.899
he just popped
out of her head?

17:37.999 --> 17:39.942
Out of her unconscious.

17:40.042 --> 17:43.317
But now that he's out,
he's obviously very real.

17:43.417 --> 17:45.275
Okay, does that mean he's gonna
keep trying to kill me?

17:45.375 --> 17:48.899
If that's what he tries to do
in your dreams, yes.

17:48.999 --> 17:52.275
Great. That's just great.
I need to think about this.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.983
So we need to hurry up
and find a way to put him back

17:55.083 --> 17:57.900
before any of our other dreams
spring to life. Shall we?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.150
- Dreams like what?
- Never mind.

18:00.250 --> 18:03.109
PAIGE: First, though, I think we
need to stop the Tracer demon

18:03.209 --> 18:06.150
before this whole city
turns into one huge nightmare,
don't you think?

18:06.250 --> 18:08.401
Yes, but it's more than one
Tracer you have to worry about.

18:08.501 --> 18:10.734
There are others
out there killing us.

18:10.834 --> 18:13.776
Which means it must be
an upper-level demon behind them

18:13.876 --> 18:15.317
orchestrating the attacks.

18:15.417 --> 18:16.942
Okay, so we write
a summoning spell,

18:17.042 --> 18:19.442
and we get the Tracer here,
we freeze him,

18:19.542 --> 18:21.734
force him to talk, we'll
vanquish him and his boss,

18:21.834 --> 18:24.776
and then the sandman can
go back to keeping dreams
where they belong.

18:24.876 --> 18:26.899
Very impressive,
and very fast.

18:26.999 --> 18:30.899
Um, what are we supposed to do
about my chain-saw killer?

18:30.999 --> 18:32.109
Oh, don't worry about him.

18:32.209 --> 18:34.109
We'll blow him up before
he lays a blade on you.

18:38.999 --> 18:40.317
You're not against parsley,
are you?

18:40.417 --> 18:43.150
- Get rid of them?
- No, I will not
get rid of them.

18:43.250 --> 18:45.150
If I get rid of them,
I have to stop the shower,

18:45.250 --> 18:47.484
- and I'm not doing that.
- All right, easy, easy.

18:47.584 --> 18:48.776
We'll go take care of them,

18:48.876 --> 18:50.192
you guys go start
the summoning spell.

18:50.292 --> 18:51.751
Go, go.

18:53.334 --> 18:55.359
Oh, thank you, Mother.

18:55.459 --> 18:56.999
Ugh! Come on.

18:59.292 --> 19:01.899
Witches? You lost him
to witches?

19:01.999 --> 19:03.109
Just let me speak.

19:03.209 --> 19:06.899
- Do they know about me?
- No, I swear.

19:06.999 --> 19:09.484
I can get to the sandman
before they ever do.

19:09.584 --> 19:11.150
I'm listening.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.025
One of the witches,

19:13.125 --> 19:15.526
she got hit
with too much dream dust.

So?

19:16.918 --> 19:19.109
[CHAIN SAW ROARING]

19:19.209 --> 19:22.401
No, wait.

19:22.501 --> 19:25.859
Sorry. I assure you,
he's no threat to us.

19:25.959 --> 19:28.125
Only to the witch
who dreamed him up.

19:30.834 --> 19:34.899
You got his attention.
You can turn that off now.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.900
That right there is her worst
nightmare, literally.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.609
And since she's scared
to death of him, I'm thinking...

19:42.709 --> 19:45.025
...if I could borrow
a few of these satchels here,

19:45.125 --> 19:48.484
I might be able to make the
other witches' dreams come to
life too.

19:48.584 --> 19:51.899
And how is this supposed to help
you fulfill your obligation to
me?

19:51.999 --> 19:57.275
It'll distract them long enough
for me to kill my mark and
collect my bounty.

19:57.375 --> 20:00.584
I better take a couple extra,
just in case.

20:01.751 --> 20:03.626
Excuse me.

20:06.083 --> 20:07.609
This better work.

20:07.709 --> 20:11.834
Otherwise, I'm gonna be
your worst nightmare.

20:19.667 --> 20:21.567
Paige, that's enough.
I want them gone.

20:21.667 --> 20:23.900
PAIGE:
Just relax, Piper.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.192
The trunk is officially empty.

20:26.292 --> 20:27.609
Great, so we're done.

20:27.709 --> 20:29.692
No way.
There's the whole back seat.

20:29.792 --> 20:31.401
Oh, you're kidding, right?

20:31.501 --> 20:33.983
Hey, Paige is the one who sent
us around to five different
stores.

20:34.083 --> 20:37.234
- PIPER: Oh, my God.
- Okay, don't look in these
bags, Piper.

20:37.334 --> 20:40.776
You're not supposed to see
the door prizes.

20:40.876 --> 20:43.109
Hey, Becca, I thought
we nixed the clown idea.

20:43.209 --> 20:46.900
Oh, no, relax. That's just
one of Paige's old toys, Slappy.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.692
- Good, because clowns
are creepy.
- Especially that one.

20:49.792 --> 20:51.067
Don't let Paige
hear you say that.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.899
- That's better.
- Okay, well, thanks, guys.

20:53.999 --> 20:55.983
You know, thanks for everything.
You should really go.

20:56.083 --> 20:57.692
And we'll call you
if we need any more stuff.

20:57.792 --> 21:01.567
Go? Paige wanted us to do all of
this before the baby shower.

21:01.667 --> 21:03.067
Yeah, I know.

21:03.167 --> 21:05.442
But I'm the one that's pregnant,
and I think we've reached our
limit.

21:05.542 --> 21:07.899
In fact, we've gone over it.
Way over it.

21:07.999 --> 21:09.526
That's all those crazy
hormones talking.

21:09.626 --> 21:12.899
Maybe you should lie down
and let us take over.

21:12.999 --> 21:14.150
No, no, I'm fine.
Really, I'm fine.

21:14.250 --> 21:16.942
The only crazy thing around
here is the shower mania.

21:17.042 --> 21:19.584
Especially when we should be
focusing on the de--

21:20.626 --> 21:22.109
Details, details.

21:22.209 --> 21:23.942
Like what are we gonna
wear and stuff.

21:24.042 --> 21:27.275
Frankly, Piper,
I'm surprised at your attitude.

21:27.375 --> 21:28.900
This is all for you.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.234
Oh, I know, and I'm thrilled.

21:30.334 --> 21:33.776
But right now, I just need
a little peace and quiet.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.037
You know, pregnant woman's
prerogative and all.

21:35.047 --> 21:36.942
WENDY: If you say so.
PIPER: I do.

21:37.042 --> 21:39.999
Yeah, okay, thanks.

21:46.999 --> 21:48.359
It's just a stupid
summoning spell.

21:48.459 --> 21:49.942
I don't know why
I can't come up with it.

21:50.042 --> 21:52.484
You need to relax.
It'll come to you.

21:52.584 --> 21:55.442
You know, maybe it's because
I'm not so sure this is a good
idea.

21:55.542 --> 21:58.609
I mean, what if I bring
the Tracer demon here,

21:58.709 --> 22:00.317
and it just makes matters worse?

22:00.417 --> 22:02.899
I mean, what then?
He has surprised us before.

22:02.999 --> 22:04.818
But that was just luck.

22:04.918 --> 22:07.442
He didn't know
your dream would come to life.

22:07.542 --> 22:10.150
Well, it did. And unfortunately,
that's all I can think about.

22:10.250 --> 22:12.359
Maybe if you can stop
and figure out what it means,

22:12.459 --> 22:14.067
you won't be afraid
of it anymore.

22:14.167 --> 22:17.626
Leo, don't you think if I could
do that I would have done it by
now?

22:19.042 --> 22:21.899
I vanquish demons every day,
real ones.

22:21.999 --> 22:24.317
So some guy from my dream
should be a piece of cake,

22:24.417 --> 22:26.899
even with power tools.

22:26.999 --> 22:28.417
So why do I run from him?

22:29.918 --> 22:31.359
- Do you know why?
- SANDMAN: No.

22:31.459 --> 22:35.417
I may be made of dreams,
but I don't shape them.

22:38.709 --> 22:41.484
Perhaps, if you can figure out
who was behind the mask.

22:41.584 --> 22:45.776
Characters in dreams symbolize
something specific in one's
life.

22:45.876 --> 22:48.899
A special person,
a certain feeling or pain.

22:48.999 --> 22:51.942
Unmask that, demystify it,

22:52.042 --> 22:55.899
and the character goes away.

22:55.999 --> 22:58.401
I don't even know
where to begin with that.

22:58.501 --> 23:00.651
My life is so great now.

23:00.751 --> 23:03.025
My marriage from
hell is behind me.

23:03.125 --> 23:05.692
I don't know why I would
start having nightmares now.

23:05.792 --> 23:08.999
Only you can answer that,
my dear.

23:09.999 --> 23:11.459
In your dreams.

23:17.417 --> 23:20.983
Not to sound unappreciative,
but this is kind of overkill.

23:21.083 --> 23:22.359
No, this is perfect.

23:22.459 --> 23:24.899
Nothing is too good
for my future niece.

23:24.999 --> 23:28.484
Okay, but Paige, this is
supposed to be a shower,
not a coronation.

23:28.584 --> 23:31.776
Hey, it is not every day that a
half-Whitelighter, half-witch is
born into this world.

23:31.876 --> 23:32.983
We need to celebrate her.

23:33.083 --> 23:36.899
Okay, but "her"
is not even gonna be here.

23:36.999 --> 23:40.109
Except for the occasional
kidney shot.

23:40.209 --> 23:44.125
Which makes me wonder if maybe
this is a little bit more about
you than her.

23:46.209 --> 23:49.150
- Where are your friends?
- Gone but not forgotten.

23:49.250 --> 23:51.776
- Are they coming back?
- Not till the shower, why?

23:51.876 --> 23:53.204
Phoebe is almost done
with the summoning spell,

23:53.214 --> 23:54.359
so we need to get ready.

23:54.459 --> 23:55.999
TRACER DEMON:
You mean for me?

24:17.292 --> 24:19.626
Oh, no. Oh--

24:21.626 --> 24:22.692
My love.

24:22.792 --> 24:24.692
No. How did you get here?

24:24.792 --> 24:26.067
Go away. Shh.

24:26.167 --> 24:28.442
No, shoo, go away!

24:28.542 --> 24:30.609
Who are you talking to?

24:30.709 --> 24:31.900
SLAPPY:
What's the matter?

24:32.000 --> 24:34.275
Don't you recognize me, honey?

40:03.459 --> 40:06.899
Unless having one is gonna
bring up some issues for you.

40:06.999 --> 40:09.234
No, no, I'm fine.

40:09.334 --> 40:13.899
You know, I would even be so big
as to consider moving it to P3.

40:13.999 --> 40:14.900
Well, I can't.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.234
I've got Beth Orton
booked for tonight.

40:17.334 --> 40:18.899
What better way to celebrate?

40:18.999 --> 40:22.542
PAIGE: Just hope we can stay
awake long enough to enjoy it.

40:28.999 --> 40:32.542

Thinking about tomorrow ]
