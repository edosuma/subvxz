00:09.545 --> 00:11.670
(small groan)

00:18.255 --> 00:20.838
- (man):Bikes vs. cars: today's topic.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.088
You're on the air.- (other man):You're right.

00:23.130 --> 00:25.131
Cars should be forced to share the road,

00:25.172 --> 00:27.297
and bikes should stop aiming to run us over.

00:27.381 --> 00:30.214
- And cyclists should rememberroads were built for bikes in

00:30.214 --> 00:34.048
the first place. It's gonna taketime for everybody to get along.

00:36.548 --> 00:38.340
Let me tell you a story, OK?

00:38.382 --> 00:41.049
One time, I ran a red light onmy bike and there happened to be

00:41.091 --> 00:43.008
a cop on the corner.I wasn't paying attention.

00:43.049 --> 00:45.299
He pulls me over with his littlefinger and he says, "Here.

00:45.341 --> 00:49.259
Have a nice day." He gives me a$50 ticket. That's a true story.

00:49.300 --> 00:51.217
So I wish there were more cops on corners...

00:51.259 --> 00:53.384
- I saw that eye-roll.You gotta give the guy a chance.

00:53.384 --> 00:55.800
He defends people on both sides,and plus, he's hilarious.

00:55.842 --> 00:58.718
- I'm just not a bigfan of Cinco Dublin.

00:58.760 --> 01:01.385
But I am a big fan of yourcoffee, Sam. Thank you.

01:01.426 --> 01:05.385
- Too nice, Lea Townshend.-Next caller.

01:10.011 --> 01:12.762
- (Lea):So, J.R., what do you think?

01:12.803 --> 01:16.845
- I love this character.

01:16.887 --> 01:19.762
What a riot.- Oh, good. I'm so relieved.

01:19.803 --> 01:22.388
- Jodie Bellarusa. She's strong,but feminine. Knows what

01:22.429 --> 01:24.638
she wants, isn't afraid to gofor it. She's my kind of gal.

01:24.638 --> 01:27.513
- I'm so glad you like her.I... Because the way

01:27.554 --> 01:29.472
I made the story flow--- Quick question.

01:29.514 --> 01:33.555
I have no idea whatthis book is about. Do you?

01:35.055 --> 01:37.305
- Um... of course I do.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.931
- Well, that's a relief,

01:38.973 --> 01:42.473
because that is notreflected in these pages.

01:42.515 --> 01:45.390
There's no drama.There's no conflict.

01:45.431 --> 01:48.557
Zilch. It's just 310 pages

01:48.557 --> 01:50.557
of rainbows.- Oh.

01:50.599 --> 01:53.099
- More like, "Uh-oh." Lea,

01:53.141 --> 01:55.892
your first book came so easy.What's going on?

01:55.933 --> 01:58.392
- Well, remember,I was writing about myself.

01:58.392 --> 02:02.893
I'm a senator's daughter, andKathleen is a senator'sdaughter....

02:02.934 --> 02:06.226
And, um, you know, I tookexperiences from my childhood

02:06.268 --> 02:10.018
and I guess made a few tweaks.- You think what you usedthe first time

02:10.059 --> 02:12.144
will work again?- I guess I'm just having

02:12.185 --> 02:15.477
a wee bit of trouble witha character that's so different.

02:15.560 --> 02:17.519
- Oh, come on.Don't get all demure on me.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.561
You're an insightfuland gifted writer.

02:19.603 --> 02:22.311
Now a book needs conflict,it needs struggle,

02:22.353 --> 02:25.561
it needs a character whoconfronts everyone whogets in her way.

02:25.603 --> 02:27.562
- She does struggle, in her way.

02:27.604 --> 02:31.146
- Well, I need Jodie Bellarusato struggle MY way.

02:31.187 --> 02:32.562
And fast.

02:32.687 --> 02:36.897
I'm gonna give it to youstraight. You're down tofour weeks to deliver.

02:36.897 --> 02:39.105
So here's your manuscript.

02:39.188 --> 02:42.980
And... here are some thoughts

02:43.063 --> 02:46.064
that the marketing departmentand I have come up with.

02:46.064 --> 02:48.898
Don't look so worried,it's only a couple of chapters.

02:48.898 --> 02:51.774
Margaret! Where's my salad?

03:17.943 --> 03:21.235
- Ugh! It took me six monthsto write this book,

03:21.235 --> 03:23.068
and now I have towrite it again?

03:23.110 --> 03:25.861
- I thought you said she onlywants a couple chapters redone.

03:25.903 --> 03:28.569
- (sighing): Yeah, but they haveto be redone her way

03:28.611 --> 03:30.528
and I'm not really surewhat way that is.

03:30.569 --> 03:33.654
- Well, you are brilliant.You will come up with something.

03:33.695 --> 03:37.654
Here, taste.- What is that?

03:39.487 --> 03:41.238
Is that dukkah spice?

03:41.280 --> 03:43.113
- Only you would taste that.It's not too much?

03:43.155 --> 03:47.738
- No.- Good. I've gotta put the duckin. There will be leftovers...

03:47.780 --> 03:50.406
- I can't, it's Friday.- Oh, right!

03:50.447 --> 03:53.364
Date night. Let me guess,Edward is whisking you off

03:53.406 --> 03:56.197
to Le Sélect Bistro? You willboth have the Dover sole

03:56.239 --> 03:58.240
and a garden salad,split a bottle of red wine,

03:58.282 --> 04:00.240
skip the coffee and headstraight for the cheque.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.573
- That is so not true.- That's a relief.

04:02.573 --> 04:05.448
- Sometimes I get the cheque.- You are so predictable.

04:05.448 --> 04:08.158
- We're not predictable,it's just that that restaurant

04:08.199 --> 04:11.033
treats us so well.- OK...

04:11.074 --> 04:13.909
What time doeshe always get you home by?

04:13.992 --> 04:16.742
- I don't know,approximately 10...

04:16.742 --> 04:20.409
15. That's a lucky guess.

04:20.450 --> 04:23.910
- You are a people-pleaser.- And you are distracting me

04:23.951 --> 04:25.576
from my work.I will call you later.

04:25.618 --> 04:27.618
- OK, but only call me if you dosomething new, like having

04:27.660 --> 04:30.536
Crêpe Suzette for a change.- I can do that.

04:32.494 --> 04:35.994
- So I was gonna start thespeech off with a joke.

04:36.036 --> 04:39.328
- OK.- Two uranium-238 nuclei

04:39.370 --> 04:41.245
are having drinks in a bar.

04:41.245 --> 04:44.287
One says to the other,"How about one more round?"

04:44.328 --> 04:47.788
Now, the other nucleus says,"Can't. Gotta split."

04:47.871 --> 04:50.746
(strained laugh)- "Gotta split."

04:50.746 --> 04:54.246
- Maybe it's nota very good joke.

04:54.246 --> 04:56.414
- No, Edward, I'm sure it is.

04:56.455 --> 04:59.039
- I'll try it out at DeanGlendale's party tomorrow night.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.914
You watch how they react.

05:03.998 --> 05:05.915
Is everything OK?

05:05.956 --> 05:07.748
- Yeah! Um, I don't know.

05:07.748 --> 05:11.541
My publisher won't accept mybook without some prettybig changes.

05:11.582 --> 05:14.624
- But your last book was sogood. I'm sure you cando it again.

05:14.666 --> 05:17.416
Why didn't you say anything?- I didn't want to worry you.

05:17.457 --> 05:21.375
- That's sweet,but I meant to J.R.

05:21.417 --> 05:23.583
- No, um...

05:23.583 --> 05:25.833
Don't worry. Let's order.

05:31.751 --> 05:34.709
Have you ever felt like youshould be moving forward,

05:34.751 --> 05:37.669
but you're just goingaround in a circle?

05:37.669 --> 05:40.252
- Good evening Professor Crowse,Ms. Townshend.

05:40.294 --> 05:44.878
- Ethan, hello.We would both like to have...

05:44.920 --> 05:47.378
(throat clearing)

05:47.420 --> 05:50.420
...the Dover soleand a green salad, please.

05:50.420 --> 05:53.421
- Excellent choice.- Actually,

05:53.504 --> 05:58.337
I'd like the Crêpe Suzette.

05:58.379 --> 06:00.922
- Do you meanthose flaming pancakes?

06:00.963 --> 06:05.255
- Yeah. Doesn't that look fun?- But it's...

06:05.297 --> 06:07.880
such a spectacle.

06:10.923 --> 06:12.756
- The Dover sole is fine.

06:12.798 --> 06:15.298
- Are you sure? I mean,have what you want.

06:15.339 --> 06:18.715
- Oh, no, yeah.It's always good here.

06:18.757 --> 06:21.757
(giggle)

06:21.799 --> 06:24.632
- You did not!- Yes, I did. Crêpe Suzettes,

06:24.674 --> 06:28.008
just like you said.- Were they as good as mine?

06:28.091 --> 06:29.925
- I don't know.

06:29.925 --> 06:31.883
As soon as I sawEdward's face, I...

06:31.925 --> 06:34.926
- You went back tothe Dover sole? Oh, Lea.

06:34.926 --> 06:37.842
Don't be such a doormat.What is your problem?

06:37.884 --> 06:39.759
- My problem isI have nothing to wear,

06:39.759 --> 06:42.718
and I need to look good forEdward's reception tonight.

06:42.760 --> 06:45.427
- Well, you always look good,and he won't notice

06:45.427 --> 06:47.885
what you're wearing, anyway.- You're right.

06:47.927 --> 06:50.135
I've spent the last two hours

06:50.177 --> 06:52.636
laying out wardrobewhen I should be writing,

06:52.678 --> 06:55.136
because I can't come up withconflict for my main character.

06:55.178 --> 06:57.553
- Why don't you use the conflictthat you have with Edward?

06:57.594 --> 06:59.762
- 'Cause we don't have any.We don't argue

06:59.762 --> 07:03.262
about anything at all. I loveEdward, he's great. He's just--

07:03.262 --> 07:05.887
- Boring? You're bored. You feelboring when you're with him,

07:05.929 --> 07:09.263
and that makes him bored.- Not at all.

07:09.305 --> 07:12.096
We're perfect for each other.We've been together two years.

07:12.096 --> 07:15.389
- You know what you need?

07:15.431 --> 07:19.181
Something that he will notice.

07:28.098 --> 07:30.307
- Whoa.

07:30.390 --> 07:33.933
- Do you like it?- Um...

07:33.974 --> 07:37.933
That is... some red dress.

07:37.974 --> 07:40.642
- Are you OK?- Yes, yeah.

07:40.684 --> 07:42.767
No, I'm, I'm fine.

07:42.767 --> 07:45.600
- Is it too much? It's too much.I can go change.

07:45.642 --> 07:49.435
Do you want me to change?- There's no time.

07:49.435 --> 07:52.935
So we will have to go with it.

07:52.976 --> 07:54.976
- OK. Well, if you're sure.

07:55.018 --> 07:57.769
- I, I am.- OK.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.936
- OK.- OK!

07:59.977 --> 08:04.437
(crickets chirping)

08:04.437 --> 08:06.937
(classical music plays)

08:15.896 --> 08:19.646
- Your glass is empty, dear.Um, I'll get you another drink.

08:19.688 --> 08:21.730
- Oh, no, don't worry about it.I can get it.

08:21.772 --> 08:24.064
You need to talk to yourprofessor friends.

08:24.105 --> 08:26.855
Go ahead.

08:26.939 --> 08:29.106
- Dr. McKinley!

08:53.275 --> 08:56.234
- (man):The Medinilla Magnifica.

08:56.276 --> 08:59.026
Otherwise known asPink Lantern.

08:59.109 --> 09:02.360
- Or a Filipino Orchid.

09:02.402 --> 09:06.485
- And here I was tryingto impress you.

09:08.902 --> 09:11.361
- Sorry, I didn'tmean to intrude.

09:11.403 --> 09:15.278
- You're Lea Townshend.

09:15.278 --> 09:17.528
- Yes. And you're Cinco Dublin.

09:17.570 --> 09:21.654
- Well, this has thepotential to get awkward.

09:21.696 --> 09:25.821
- I'm sure youwere just doing your jobwhen you reviewed my book.

09:25.862 --> 09:27.447
- Well,

09:27.447 --> 09:29.613
now we're right in the middleof awkward, aren't we?

09:29.655 --> 09:32.780
Who remembers a stupid littleon-air book review?

09:32.822 --> 09:36.114
- "Although well-written,Ms. Townshend's safe,

09:36.114 --> 09:38.864
"Leave it to Beavertake on her childhood

09:38.906 --> 09:41.281
"leaves me wantingabsolutely nothing more

09:41.281 --> 09:45.115
from this author, ever."

09:45.115 --> 09:47.032
- Wow. That's pretty brutal.

09:47.074 --> 09:49.532
(indistinct chatterand laughter)

09:52.116 --> 09:56.283
Would you hold that?Throw it in my face.

09:56.325 --> 09:57.908
- What?- Throw it in my face.

09:57.950 --> 10:02.159
- I'm not going tothrow wine in your face.- I deserve it. Please.

10:25.204 --> 10:28.412
Red's your colour.

10:33.080 --> 10:36.163
- There you are.I've been looking for you.

10:36.205 --> 10:39.538
- Uh, I've been right herethe whole time.

10:39.580 --> 10:42.747
- Is this becauseI don't like your dress?

10:42.789 --> 10:46.081
- You don't?- No, I-- I'm sorry.

10:46.122 --> 10:47.831
I didn't... I didn't mean that.

10:47.872 --> 10:52.123
It's just, you don't needall that fancy stuff.

10:52.123 --> 10:54.248
- I was just trying...

10:54.290 --> 10:57.165
- To what?- Nothing. Don't worry about it.

10:57.207 --> 11:00.583
Let's enjoy the party.- OK.

11:21.460 --> 11:25.169
(knocking)It's Edward!

11:25.252 --> 11:28.544
- Come in?- Hi!

11:28.586 --> 11:31.128
- Hi...- I apologize for not calling

11:31.170 --> 11:34.170
before coming over.- No, I think it's great

11:34.212 --> 11:37.295
that you did somethingspontaneous. Wow!

11:37.295 --> 11:39.796
What's going on?

11:41.296 --> 11:43.254
They're really lovely.

11:43.296 --> 11:46.129
- Aren't you gonnaread the card?

11:49.797 --> 11:54.214
- "I want to do everythingto make us work,

11:54.255 --> 11:57.298
"and I know you wantto make it work too.

11:57.381 --> 11:59.715
XO."

12:01.298 --> 12:04.132
"20% off four-week course

12:04.132 --> 12:05.966
"in conflict management,

12:06.049 --> 12:09.132
paid in full."- When I saw this ad,

12:09.132 --> 12:12.592
I thought this is perfect.You know, conflict is harder

12:12.633 --> 12:14.592
for some, morethan it is for others.

12:14.633 --> 12:18.050
- Yes. What does thishave to do with us?

12:18.092 --> 12:21.634
- Well, things were a littleawkward the other night

12:21.634 --> 12:23.634
and you have been saying howmuch trouble you're having

12:23.634 --> 12:27.551
with the character in your book.- Yeah, that was really nothing.

12:27.593 --> 12:30.344
- No, but it got me thinking.You know, maybe we should...

12:30.385 --> 12:32.302
"learn to deal with conflict

12:32.344 --> 12:34.885
in a proactive,life-enhancing way."

12:36.803 --> 12:39.720
What do you say?- Uh, I guess if you think

12:39.761 --> 12:42.553
this will help us.- Great!

12:42.595 --> 12:44.387
OK! OK, good!

12:44.429 --> 12:46.971
Um... right.First session is tonight.

12:46.971 --> 12:50.554
Address is right here on thecoupon. I have to run to work.

12:50.596 --> 12:52.763
This is gonna be so good.

12:52.805 --> 12:55.222
You'll see.(loud kissing sound)

12:55.263 --> 12:58.013
I am so excited.

13:10.807 --> 13:14.432
(song:Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairyby Tchaikovsky)

13:24.183 --> 13:25.726
- I'm sorry?

13:25.767 --> 13:27.517
- (whispering): Carol.- Carol, Carol.

13:27.559 --> 13:30.309
Yeah, you paid cash, so you canjust have a seat right there.

13:30.351 --> 13:33.434
Oh! Just a sec. Hello, there.

13:33.476 --> 13:35.935
Welcome. Name, please.

13:35.977 --> 13:38.518
- Edward Crowse?

13:38.560 --> 13:40.810
Oh, no, I'm Lea Townshend.But, um,

13:40.852 --> 13:42.894
Edward Crowse signed us upfor this group.

13:42.936 --> 13:46.353
- Lea Townshend, as inThe Senator's DaughterLea Townshend?

13:46.394 --> 13:48.353
- Yes.- I was wondering!

13:48.394 --> 13:49.978
Wow, I really loved that book.

13:49.978 --> 13:51.937
- Oh, thank you.- But you know, don't worry.

13:51.979 --> 13:53.937
They don't need to knowthat there's a celebrity.

13:53.979 --> 13:56.312
I'm sure you get reallybothered by all the fans.

13:56.354 --> 13:58.480
Oh, yeah, here you are.Here you are.

13:58.521 --> 14:00.271
But no Edward Crowse.

14:00.313 --> 14:03.271
- Oh, well, Edward's never late.Can we wait for him?

14:03.313 --> 14:06.313
- Well, if he's not on the list,he's not in the class,

14:06.355 --> 14:08.064
so looks likeyou're on your own.

14:08.106 --> 14:11.022
- No, I'm surehe'll be here any minute.

14:11.106 --> 14:12.731
That's probably him!

14:12.772 --> 14:16.607
- Well, made it witha minute to spare!

14:16.648 --> 14:18.690
Hi, you must be Marilyn.- I am.

14:18.732 --> 14:22.440
- I'm Cinco Dublin and thisis my court order.

14:22.482 --> 14:24.149
Yeah, that's me.

14:24.191 --> 14:26.441
I lost my cool witha guest that was rude...

14:26.483 --> 14:28.941
- Oh, Ms. Townshend,we haven't quite

14:28.983 --> 14:31.692
finished yourregistration yet.

14:34.484 --> 14:37.359
- What are you doing here?

14:37.442 --> 14:40.276
This is my favourite novelist!

14:40.318 --> 14:42.151
One word...

14:42.235 --> 14:45.860
awkward.(Marilyn mouthing silently.)

14:45.901 --> 14:49.236
- Hello, everyone. Welcome.My name is Marilyn Hawkins,

14:49.277 --> 14:52.319
and I will be helping younavigate your way

14:52.319 --> 14:54.986
through various degrees ofconflict management.

14:54.986 --> 14:57.612
So why don't we start byintroducing ourselves?

14:57.653 --> 14:59.737
- I'm Glenda,and if you must know,

14:59.778 --> 15:02.403
the husband thoughtthis was a good idea.

15:02.445 --> 15:05.029
- Robert, "the husband."

15:05.113 --> 15:07.988
I thought this was a good ideabecause "the wife"

15:07.988 --> 15:10.404
has a hard time keepingher opinions to herself.

15:10.404 --> 15:12.614
- Well, if someone actuallydid the things he said

15:12.655 --> 15:16.239
he was gonna do, I wouldn't--- Do you know how busy I get?- OK.

15:16.280 --> 15:19.655
OK, Robert? Glenda?That's why you're here.

15:19.697 --> 15:23.240
This is actually perfect. OK.

15:23.281 --> 15:25.323
- Oh, hi. I'm Ernie,

15:25.323 --> 15:27.323
and I'm so happy to be here.

15:27.365 --> 15:30.491
- And why are you here?- That's an excellent question.

15:30.532 --> 15:33.491
On my last performance review,

15:33.532 --> 15:35.532
it was noted thatI have the tendency

15:35.574 --> 15:37.867
to be "passive aggressive."

15:37.908 --> 15:40.158
- Not to worry,we can help you with that.

15:40.158 --> 15:42.658
- Great.

15:42.742 --> 15:46.326
(whispering)

15:48.701 --> 15:51.326
- I'm sorry?- (whispering): I'm Carol.

15:51.368 --> 15:54.160
I would like peopleto listen to me.

15:54.202 --> 15:57.702
- I think that's an excellentdecision, Carol.

15:57.744 --> 16:01.285
So that just leaves you.- Uh, I'm Lea Townshend.

16:01.327 --> 16:03.661
I don't really have anyproblems with conflict,

16:03.703 --> 16:05.703
so I don't know why I'm here.- OK, well,

16:05.745 --> 16:07.995
maybe we can startwith Edward Crowse

16:07.995 --> 16:10.787
and why you thinkhe should be here.

16:10.829 --> 16:14.496
- Um, Edward is my second cousin

16:14.537 --> 16:16.329
and this was reallyall his idea, so...

16:16.329 --> 16:20.538
- Your second cousin signed youboth up for a conflictmanagement group?

16:20.580 --> 16:22.497
- Yeah.- OK, so,

16:22.497 --> 16:25.122
why do you supposehe's not here?

16:25.163 --> 16:28.539
- You know, he reallyhasn't been feeling well.

16:28.581 --> 16:31.456
He's recovering from surgery.

16:31.498 --> 16:35.332
Kidney surgery.- Oh... wish hima speedy recovery.

16:35.332 --> 16:38.749
OK, so before we begin,I just have a little bitof housekeeping here.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.207
So, Ernie, it says here

16:41.249 --> 16:43.666
that you did notpay for the class.

16:43.750 --> 16:47.166
- What? No, I paid online.Who said I didn't pay?

16:47.208 --> 16:50.708
- Kidney surgery. That'sa pretty serious procedure,

16:50.750 --> 16:52.626
did you know that?

16:52.667 --> 16:54.709
- Mm-hmm. Who do youthink the donor was?

16:54.751 --> 16:58.334
- You know, Ernie, I have toreport all your actionsto your supervisor.

16:58.376 --> 17:01.835
- Since when?- Well, you know what? Ifyou have a receipt, then we can

17:01.835 --> 17:03.835
clear this up right now.

17:03.877 --> 17:07.127
- That was nice of you. Does itstill hurt a little bit,right here?

17:07.167 --> 17:08.794
- Yes, but I thinkwe should be listening.

17:08.836 --> 17:12.586
- That's so funny, because youknow, your kidneysare back here.

17:12.627 --> 17:15.752
Should be hurting there.- Right.

17:15.794 --> 17:18.628
- No, I don't have the receipt.- Well, I guess

17:18.670 --> 17:20.378
that's a lesson in itself.

17:20.420 --> 17:22.962
But I'm sorry, you can't stay.- What?!

17:24.505 --> 17:27.505
- You see, conflict will almostalways take us by surprise.

17:27.505 --> 17:30.046
It's not something you can planfor. See, Ernie here,

17:30.088 --> 17:32.714
he didn't realize his actionswould result in conflict.

17:32.756 --> 17:35.547
- Hey. I don't likebeing made to look stupid.

17:35.631 --> 17:37.922
- Too late.- Maybe you shouldstay out of this.

17:37.964 --> 17:41.465
- Are you threatening my wife?- Hey, guys, guys! It'sconflict-management group,

17:41.507 --> 17:43.673
remember? I'm sure Erniedidn't mean anything by it.

17:43.715 --> 17:48.382
- It's OK, guys. Why don't youhave a seat? Alright. So you cansee how layered conflict can be.

17:48.423 --> 17:50.508
- That was a stunt?- Yes, it was.

17:50.508 --> 17:54.341
Thank you very much, Ernie.You can sit down.

17:54.383 --> 17:57.509
- Was that too much? 'Cause itkind of felt... Yeah? OK.

17:57.509 --> 18:00.009
- So this is veryinteresting. So Glenda,

18:00.050 --> 18:03.009
you deal with conflictby using sarcasm.

18:03.050 --> 18:06.926
And Robert, you takeconflict by the horns.

18:06.968 --> 18:10.426
And Cinco, I was very impressed.You really jumped in there.

18:10.510 --> 18:13.510
But just be careful, becausesometimes jumping incan backfire.

18:13.551 --> 18:18.011
Carol. You looked like you wereready to flee the scene.

18:18.011 --> 18:21.344
It's OK, we'll workon that. And Lea...

18:21.344 --> 18:23.345
judging by the lookon your face,

18:23.387 --> 18:25.428
you look like you'd ratherget a root canal

18:25.470 --> 18:27.345
than deal with conflict,am I right?

18:27.387 --> 18:29.887
- I just think everybodyshould be able to get along.

18:29.928 --> 18:32.638
- Hear, hear!- OK, well,

18:32.679 --> 18:34.596
I'm very happy thatyou guys are all here.

18:34.638 --> 18:38.555
So why don't we start offwith the first exercise.It's very simple.

18:41.347 --> 18:45.014
(knocking)

18:45.014 --> 18:48.390
- Lea! Oh, you didn't call.

18:48.431 --> 18:51.806
- Sorry about that.

18:53.848 --> 18:57.182
Where were you?- Excuse me?

18:57.224 --> 19:00.432
- The flowers, the coupon,the class... that was tonight!

19:00.474 --> 19:03.475
- Yes, yes, I know.How did it go?

19:03.517 --> 19:05.142
- How did it go?- Mm-hmm.

19:05.183 --> 19:09.475
- I...- Please tell meit was helpful for you.

19:09.517 --> 19:11.684
- I thought you got it

19:11.684 --> 19:15.018
to be helpful for us,not just me.

19:15.018 --> 19:17.809
- I don't havea problem with conflict.

19:17.851 --> 19:20.435
- Neither do I!

19:20.519 --> 19:23.935
I don't!- Lea...

19:23.935 --> 19:26.352
The fact that you came all theway over here tonight

19:26.352 --> 19:29.395
to tell me how you really feelis a really big step for you.

19:29.395 --> 19:33.520
- It is?- I think this isgonna be really good for you.

19:33.520 --> 19:36.104
OK, think of itas an investment...

19:36.146 --> 19:39.187
in our relationship. I mean,I know that I am committed

19:39.229 --> 19:42.604
to doing whatever it takesto make this work.

19:42.646 --> 19:44.980
Aren't you?

19:44.980 --> 19:48.355
- Yes, sure. Of course I am.

19:49.897 --> 19:52.856
- OK. So this next exercise

19:52.898 --> 19:55.398
is called Address and Accept.

19:55.439 --> 19:58.398
One partner has to address theother with a strong opinion.

19:58.439 --> 20:02.357
The other one has to just acceptand respond honestly,

20:02.399 --> 20:06.815
but without challenging or fear.Let's start with Cinco and Lea.

20:16.525 --> 20:19.651
(quietly):OK, Lea, you can start.

20:23.234 --> 20:25.317
- (laughing): I can't.- OK. Just,

20:25.359 --> 20:29.943
you don't like his clothes,he interrupts people...

20:35.153 --> 20:37.028
- I just can'tthink of anything.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.653
- OK, alright.So Cinco, you can start.

20:40.694 --> 20:43.362
- I think you need this class

20:43.404 --> 20:46.404
more than anyone elsein here. Respectfully.

20:46.445 --> 20:48.862
- What do you thinkof that? You tell him.

20:48.862 --> 20:51.363
What do you think of that?

20:51.405 --> 20:53.530
- Uh... I, I...

20:53.571 --> 20:55.946
I think that he doesn'tactually know me,

20:56.030 --> 20:58.822
and how could he possiblymake a comment like that?

20:58.822 --> 21:01.864
- OK, that's good.Tell Cinco, not me.

21:04.364 --> 21:07.407
- You know what? No.I think my cousin, Edward,

21:07.407 --> 21:10.032
made a mistake and didn't knowwhat kind of class this was.

21:10.073 --> 21:12.115
I'm sorry, but I thinkI'm wasting everybody's time.

21:12.198 --> 21:15.658
- OK, but don't leavewith your problem, alright?

21:15.699 --> 21:17.366
- My problem?

21:17.366 --> 21:19.283
You know what?Maybe you have a problem,

21:19.324 --> 21:21.699
with your nice voice and calmdemeanor, and maybe it's all

21:21.741 --> 21:25.617
just a front, and maybe youdon't know how to deal withanything at all, ever!

21:25.659 --> 21:29.242
- That's fantastic. Great work.

21:29.284 --> 21:32.618
But say it to Cinco, not to me.What she's experiencing

21:32.660 --> 21:34.535
right now is calledmisplaced anger.

21:34.535 --> 21:36.743
It's very, very common.You can just have a seat.

21:36.785 --> 21:39.786
Let's have Robertand Ernie up next.

21:39.869 --> 21:42.244
Good work.

21:45.661 --> 21:47.494
- For what it's worth,Professor,

21:47.536 --> 21:50.662
I entirely concurwith your assessment.

21:50.703 --> 21:52.703
- Thank you.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.453
That actually sounded sincere.

21:54.495 --> 21:59.288
- And I would hate to haveyou turn that piercinginsight on me.

22:08.622 --> 22:11.080
(Cinco):A lot of you have been wondering, you know,

22:11.164 --> 22:13.206
how my court-ordered conflict...- OK, hear me out. First,

22:13.248 --> 22:15.790
I don't have anyconflict in my life.

22:15.831 --> 22:17.873
Edward and I have literally...have not had

22:17.915 --> 22:20.123
one single argument.

22:20.206 --> 22:22.499
Plus, you know what? I don'teven like to hurt people.

22:22.541 --> 22:24.541
I don't like tohurt people's feelings.

22:24.541 --> 22:27.041
What does she know aboutmisplaced anger? What anger?

22:27.082 --> 22:29.542
I'm not going backto that class.- Wait...

22:29.542 --> 22:33.125
- ...OK, so she claims she hasno conflict issues whatsoever.

22:33.125 --> 22:36.000
So naturally, I tell herI think she needs this class

22:36.042 --> 22:39.584
more than anybody else in there.- So weird. He is talking about

22:39.626 --> 22:42.376
his group, and so are you.-And her reply is,

22:42.376 --> 22:45.168
"I really don't think I need tobe here." So folks, obviously,

22:45.209 --> 22:48.294
I beg to differ. Now I'm notgoing to name names, because

22:48.377 --> 22:50.335
I'm not that kind of guy. Did I just say that out loud?

22:50.335 --> 22:53.711
I think I did.OK, here's the point.Here's what I want to say.

22:53.711 --> 22:55.545
I think this classis a great thing

22:55.545 --> 22:57.711
for people who have conflictissues of all kinds,

22:57.753 --> 22:59.628
not just for anger management...

22:59.670 --> 23:01.545
- When did you startlistening to this nut?

23:01.586 --> 23:05.504
- Since you told me that he wasin your group. It is you, right?

23:05.546 --> 23:08.712
- It's all for show.- My question is this:

23:08.754 --> 23:11.547
why is it so difficult for us

23:11.588 --> 23:13.922
to face the truthabout ourselves?

23:13.963 --> 23:16.047
(Lea laughs.)- Mm-hmm.

23:16.088 --> 23:20.173
- Someone so convinced they donot have issues with conflict...

23:20.214 --> 23:22.548
Get this. She then --

23:22.548 --> 23:25.006
instead of doing the exercisewith me, her partner --

23:25.048 --> 23:27.549
she goes after the teacher.She goes right after her.

23:27.590 --> 23:30.215
She lets her have it.- No, that's not what happened.

23:30.215 --> 23:32.882
- She's got no conflict issueswhatsoever, she's good to go.

23:32.882 --> 23:36.050
It's a question that ison my mind, callers.

23:36.050 --> 23:38.716
And I want to hear from you.

23:38.758 --> 23:42.425
- What are you doing?(beeping)

23:42.466 --> 23:46.509
- Cinco D, you're on the air.- Well, um,

23:46.551 --> 23:48.592
I... I...

23:48.676 --> 23:52.718
- OK, let's start with somethingvery easy. What is your name?

23:52.760 --> 23:54.760
- Jodie.

23:54.802 --> 23:57.010
Jodie Bellarusa.(mouthing silently)

23:57.052 --> 24:00.594
- Jodie. Hi, Jodie. What do youthink of my confused Madame X?

24:00.678 --> 24:03.719
- You know what? Maybe that girldoesn't belong in the group.

24:03.719 --> 24:06.553
Maybe you just love conflict somuch that you thrive on it,

24:06.636 --> 24:09.762
and you've become, like,this conflict vampire.

24:09.804 --> 24:11.595
And then when you'reattracted to someone

24:11.637 --> 24:14.179
who doesn't have the sameconflict issues, you get uneasy

24:14.179 --> 24:16.471
and defensive. When in truth,it's really you

24:16.513 --> 24:19.096
not being able to dealwith how you really feel.

24:19.096 --> 24:23.388
- What makes you sayI'm attracted to her?

24:23.430 --> 24:25.347
(beep)

24:25.389 --> 24:29.972
- Wow. It's too bad that youcouldn't say that as yourself.

24:30.014 --> 24:32.515
- I think I mademy point clear enough.

24:32.557 --> 24:34.640
You should take this. Take that.-This is Cinco Dublin

24:34.682 --> 24:37.182
in the morning, and we're gonnabe right back after this break.

24:37.223 --> 24:39.473
- I'm glad you could make it.

24:39.515 --> 24:41.766
Your mother saidyou were trying to cancel.

24:41.808 --> 24:44.558
- I did not say that, Douglas.I said she was working.

24:44.558 --> 24:47.016
- I would never cancel on you.- Good girl.

24:47.058 --> 24:51.725
- Douglas, what didthe doctor say? No salt.

24:51.767 --> 24:54.309
He also said,"Avoid stressful situations,"

24:54.350 --> 24:57.643
and I caught him listening tothe Cinco Dublin show today.

24:57.685 --> 24:59.268
(cutlery clattering)

24:59.310 --> 25:03.018
- No! You should reallylisten to your doctor.

25:03.060 --> 25:05.894
- The kid's a fool.- Your doctor isabout 70 years old.

25:05.936 --> 25:09.936
- No, Dublin. It's outrageous.He's got a platform topoison the public mind --

25:09.977 --> 25:12.519
just like his old man.I mean, that father of his

25:12.561 --> 25:15.312
devoted his entire newspapercareer to attacking

25:15.395 --> 25:17.603
every stand that I took.- Douglas, don't exaggerate.

25:17.645 --> 25:19.978
- I believe in the good,solid middle of the road.

25:19.978 --> 25:22.063
And if I was a little bitto the left of an issue,

25:22.063 --> 25:24.479
he claimed I was too liberal.If I had one foot to the right,

25:24.521 --> 25:28.229
he claimed I was tooconservative. I mean,is that fair to me?

25:28.229 --> 25:30.730
Lea?- Me?

25:30.730 --> 25:32.397
Um, well, I think

25:32.397 --> 25:35.897
whatever his fatherdid to you is...

25:35.897 --> 25:38.064
well, it's between youand Dublin Sr.

25:38.105 --> 25:40.065
It doesn't really haveanything to do with Cinco.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.856
- Lea, I'm surprised. Did youhear the broadcast?

25:42.898 --> 25:45.023
- Yes, dear. We allheard the broadcast.

25:45.065 --> 25:48.607
It wasn't that bad.- You agree with that, Lea?

25:50.941 --> 25:52.566
- I'm sure it was an outrage.

25:52.566 --> 25:56.442
- Good, exactly. At least I cancount on someone for the truth.

25:59.067 --> 26:01.150
- Hope you're rememberingto shower.

26:01.192 --> 26:03.151
- Yes, of course I am.

26:03.193 --> 26:06.818
- I remember the last book.You wore the same pair ofsweatpants for days.

26:06.859 --> 26:10.401
- Well, that was because thewashing machine was broken.

26:10.443 --> 26:12.235
Mm-hmm.

26:12.277 --> 26:15.444
Have you, um...ever had flaming pancakes?

26:15.485 --> 26:18.402
- You mean Crêpe Suzette?Many times.

26:18.444 --> 26:22.611
- And Daddy wasn't embarrassed?- Never with your father!

26:22.653 --> 26:26.361
- So have you always donewhatever Daddy wants?

26:26.403 --> 26:28.571
- We're settled in our ways.- Yeah, see,

26:28.612 --> 26:31.154
I keep trying to spicethings up with Edward

26:31.196 --> 26:33.904
by suggesting we try new things,

26:33.946 --> 26:36.780
and he looks at me as if I'vesaid we should rob a bank.

26:36.822 --> 26:40.447
- (chuckling): It's calleda relationship, Lea.

26:40.488 --> 26:45.739
It has ebbs and flows. It can'talways be smooth sailing.

26:48.739 --> 26:51.864
- So it took me a couple of daysto kick in, but then it really

26:51.906 --> 26:54.324
clicked. I totally see yourpoint. And writing all this

26:54.407 --> 26:57.574
conflict, it really kicks upthe drama, and it's exciting.

26:57.615 --> 26:59.865
I'm excited about the revisions.

26:59.907 --> 27:01.866
I'm almost done!- No.

27:01.908 --> 27:03.908
- No?- Nooo.

27:03.950 --> 27:05.825
Yes, now there is someconflict in Jodie's life,

27:05.908 --> 27:09.242
but it's not handled right.- Is she too aggressive now?

27:09.326 --> 27:11.951
- Sweetie, I'm goingto read you something

27:11.951 --> 27:13.909
straight from the dictionary.

27:13.951 --> 27:16.576
"Conflict: to come intocollision or disagreement.

27:16.659 --> 27:19.493
A struggle oran opposition, a clash.

27:19.577 --> 27:21.285
(slam)There's no clash.

27:21.327 --> 27:25.118
Everything happens in her head.She doesn't do anything.

27:25.160 --> 27:28.453
- She will, J.R. She will.

27:28.536 --> 27:30.411
I'm not going to let you down.

27:30.411 --> 27:32.411
I can rewrite as muchas you want.

27:32.453 --> 27:35.204
Besides, wasn't itHemingway that said,

27:35.245 --> 27:37.412
"A good novel should takeat least 10 years"?

27:37.454 --> 27:40.245
- Hemingway didn'thave a huge advance

27:40.287 --> 27:42.746
he might have had to pay back.

27:46.330 --> 27:49.413
(whispering)

27:49.455 --> 27:52.956
- Hi.- Hi!

27:54.664 --> 27:57.247
- I'm giving the booka second chance.

27:57.247 --> 27:59.457
Like I do with people.

27:59.498 --> 28:03.373
- Thank you?- Thank you.

28:04.957 --> 28:08.333
- I suppose I have conflict withthe buyers I deal with.

28:08.374 --> 28:11.333
I've been written up seven times

28:11.374 --> 28:13.916
because of peopleI considered friends.

28:13.916 --> 28:18.834
What about you?- Uh, I really haveno conflict in my life.

28:18.875 --> 28:21.250
In fact, my publishersays I have no conflict

28:21.250 --> 28:23.418
in my new book, which... I mean,there is, but apparently

28:23.460 --> 28:26.918
it's not the right kind.- What about the father-daughter

28:26.960 --> 28:30.293
relationship in your first book?Wasn't that based on your life?

28:30.376 --> 28:31.919
- No, I'm not that character.

28:32.002 --> 28:35.919
I mean, I would never doanything to disappointor embarrass my father.

28:35.919 --> 28:37.919
- Is that because youhave an easy, breezy,

28:37.919 --> 28:42.170
carefree relationship with him?Or is it because youavoid conflict?

28:42.212 --> 28:43.920
- It's pretty breezy.

28:43.962 --> 28:46.420
- Excuse me, I wantto say something.

28:46.462 --> 28:49.171
I'm re-readingyour old book, as you know.

28:49.213 --> 28:52.463
And it's got a little Victorianplotting in it, but onceyou get past that,

28:52.504 --> 28:54.963
it seems like it's written fromthe heart. So now you're saying

28:55.004 --> 28:58.464
you want to rewrite the conflictto pander to your publisher.

28:58.505 --> 29:01.380
- I'm not pandering, and that'snot even what pandering means.

29:01.422 --> 29:03.380
I didn't say I agreedwith my publisher.

29:03.422 --> 29:06.590
And by the way, can we rememberfor a moment that you don'tactually know me?

29:06.631 --> 29:10.465
- I know that I'm not a doormatfor a publisher or a father.

29:10.506 --> 29:14.382
- Thanks, Ernie. Really? Becausemany believe that most men

29:14.424 --> 29:17.424
have unresolved issueswith their fathers.

29:17.424 --> 29:19.591
- I'm not most men.(scoffing)

29:19.632 --> 29:22.842
- I've heard your show.- What's that supposed to mean?

29:22.883 --> 29:25.050
- Well, your dad is a respectedman in this city.

29:25.092 --> 29:28.217
You're an entertainer.He's a political journalist.

29:28.258 --> 29:31.843
- I'm a journalist.- You're a shock jock.

29:31.926 --> 29:34.009
- OK, loud and fast, withoutthinking about it,

29:34.093 --> 29:37.219
I want you to tell me a sourceof your conflict. Go!

29:37.260 --> 29:39.302
- Bullies!

29:42.010 --> 29:44.260
- Pretty much everyoneI work with.

29:44.260 --> 29:46.261
- Her.- Him!

29:46.261 --> 29:48.470
- Excellent. OK, so let's goplay Conflict

29:48.511 --> 29:51.220
Snakes and Ladders. Let's go!

29:53.345 --> 29:55.637
- Go! Come on, let's go.

29:55.679 --> 29:58.596
- I didn't mean to upset you.

29:58.596 --> 30:01.179
- Not at all,it's not a big deal.

30:01.262 --> 30:03.138
You're just a know-it-all.

30:03.222 --> 30:05.638
- I call them as I see them.

30:05.680 --> 30:08.722
- Maybe you need some glasses.

30:08.763 --> 30:12.223
- Maybe, but there are certainthings I see clearly.

30:24.557 --> 30:26.475
(Cinco):In my opinion, this is a crisis

30:26.475 --> 30:30.100
that everyone in this country --not just us here today --

30:30.100 --> 30:31.808
needs to pay attention to.

30:31.850 --> 30:35.351
Should your educationcost more than a sedan?

30:35.392 --> 30:37.934
Or two? When I wasa student here,

30:37.976 --> 30:42.142
I just had to pay for books and,you know, party favours.

30:42.184 --> 30:45.227
(chuckling)But today, it's out of control.

30:45.268 --> 30:47.518
We're gonna hear frommy good friend the dean

30:47.560 --> 30:50.268
in a minute, but right nowI wanna hear from you guys.

30:50.310 --> 30:54.103
How do you think, uh...

30:54.144 --> 30:57.728
What do you feel?

31:02.145 --> 31:05.145
- There's no class until 10.

31:05.187 --> 31:07.270
- (giggling): Hello.

31:07.312 --> 31:09.688
- Lea! What's wrong?

31:09.730 --> 31:13.230
- Nothing's wrong. I... Don'tworry, you didn't forget a date.

31:13.271 --> 31:15.771
I just wanted to surprise youbefore your morning class.

31:15.771 --> 31:17.647
- Great.

31:17.689 --> 31:20.272
Yeah, no, that, that, that...I'm so glad you did.

31:20.272 --> 31:23.731
- Yeah, me too. Here, muffins.

31:25.357 --> 31:29.607
And I have coffee, fresh fromSam's Coffee Truck. Coffee?

31:33.149 --> 31:35.024
- (quietly): Oh, thank you.

31:35.066 --> 31:37.941
- So what are youlecturing on today?

31:38.024 --> 31:41.109
- We are halfway intoHeisenberg's theory.

31:41.150 --> 31:44.567
- Oh. That sounds interesting.

31:44.567 --> 31:46.442
- Really?- Mm-hmm.

31:46.484 --> 31:48.442
- The theory is that duringquantum experiments,

31:48.442 --> 31:50.776
there is a seeminglyunavoidable tendency of humans

31:50.776 --> 31:53.151
to influence any givensituation. Just as you have

31:53.193 --> 31:55.568
influenced this situation.

32:09.028 --> 32:12.153
- Hey. Lea.

32:12.195 --> 32:14.446
- Hi. What are you doing here?

32:14.488 --> 32:17.279
- We like to get the showon the road sometimes.

32:17.279 --> 32:20.238
Um, that's funny,because I thought I saw you

32:20.279 --> 32:23.197
watching the broadcasta few minutes ago.

32:23.239 --> 32:25.822
What brings you here?

32:25.864 --> 32:28.864
- I was here to see my cousin,

32:28.905 --> 32:32.698
but I'm leaving. I was just,I was just leaving.

32:32.740 --> 32:36.948
- Edward.- Yeah. He's a professor here

32:36.990 --> 32:38.907
and it's his firstweek back at work,

32:38.949 --> 32:42.282
and, uh, I just wanted tosee if he settled in OK.

32:42.324 --> 32:44.116
- That was veryconsiderate of you.

32:44.199 --> 32:47.575
- Yeah, thank you.- You're welcome.

32:47.617 --> 32:49.783
I want to apologize for, um...

32:49.825 --> 32:52.117
if I offended youat the last class.

32:52.158 --> 32:55.493
- Don't be. There'sreally no need. I'm fine.

32:55.576 --> 32:58.034
- OK, well, at tonight's class,

32:58.118 --> 33:00.659
I'm going to make an effort tobe a little more sensitive.

33:00.701 --> 33:03.035
And I feel like I'm learning.

33:03.119 --> 33:07.744
- That's very generous, butI won't be going back to class.

33:07.785 --> 33:10.952
I'm really behind on my bookand if I don't turn it in,

33:10.994 --> 33:15.203
like, yesterday...- Um, that's really too bad.

33:15.286 --> 33:17.120
I kinda like you,Lea Townshend.

33:17.203 --> 33:20.246
Now I'm gonna haveto bond with Carol, so...

33:20.287 --> 33:22.204
She scares me, I gotta tell you.

33:22.287 --> 33:24.329
Well, good luck with your book.

33:24.371 --> 33:26.871
And, um...

33:26.912 --> 33:30.288
I'm gonna try to be gentleron my next review.

33:30.330 --> 33:33.622
(small laugh)

33:37.373 --> 33:39.331
(knocking)

33:39.373 --> 33:41.581
- Edward.

33:41.623 --> 33:44.039
(loud kissing sound)Hi. Oh!

33:44.082 --> 33:46.332
What's all this?- You know, I was so taken

33:46.374 --> 33:48.124
with your spontaneousgesture this morning,

33:48.165 --> 33:52.291
and your interest in my work,that I wanted to reciprocate.

33:52.333 --> 33:56.083
- Are those student papers?

33:56.125 --> 33:58.458
- Mm. My advanced class.

33:58.500 --> 34:00.959
I thought what fun it would befor you and I to spend

34:01.001 --> 34:02.917
the evening reviewingthem together.

34:02.959 --> 34:07.709
- Edward, I need to apologizefor barging in on you

34:07.751 --> 34:10.293
this morning. It wasreally a silly idea.

34:10.335 --> 34:13.627
- Yeah, it reallywas unlike you.

34:13.627 --> 34:16.710
- Well, you know, sometimesit's good to be unlike me.

34:16.752 --> 34:20.293
- Why would it be goodto be unlike you?

34:20.335 --> 34:23.168
- Right. Sorry.

34:23.210 --> 34:26.295
- Listen, why don't you ordera pizza? If we start now,

34:26.295 --> 34:28.629
we could be finishedall this by 11.

34:31.045 --> 34:34.505
- You know what? I forgot.I have my group tonight.

34:34.545 --> 34:36.670
- Tonight?- Yeah.

34:36.670 --> 34:40.005
I hope you're notterribly disappointed.

34:40.045 --> 34:42.547
- So, so it's going well, then?

34:42.630 --> 34:45.047
- It's a process.

34:45.089 --> 34:48.005
- Wow. You know, I am so gladthat you are getting --

34:48.089 --> 34:51.382
whoa -- what you need from it.- I am.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.965
- Well, OK.(Edward chuckles.)

34:59.341 --> 35:01.216
- Sorry I'm late.Oh! Is it over?

35:01.258 --> 35:04.591
- We're going on a field trip.- Well, this is a nice surprise.

35:04.633 --> 35:06.216
- I think I was in conflict.

35:06.258 --> 35:09.634
- So you came in to work it out!- No, I came to avoid it.

35:09.675 --> 35:11.634
(laughing)

35:11.634 --> 35:14.801
- OK, so I'm going to split youup into teams of two.

35:14.801 --> 35:17.510
I thought it would be fun if weadded a little competition.

35:17.551 --> 35:21.468
And the winner getsa gift card to Mangallo's.

35:21.510 --> 35:23.886
OK, everybody choose a colour.

35:23.927 --> 35:27.094
- (quietly): That place isimpossible to get in,it's so hot.

35:27.136 --> 35:29.552
- (whispering):We should team up, OK?

35:31.178 --> 35:34.470
- OK, now find the person thathas the matching colour.

35:34.512 --> 35:37.512
- Oh.

35:40.388 --> 35:43.054
- Now, the objectiveof this exercise

35:43.096 --> 35:46.096
is to stall in the lineas long as you can.

35:46.138 --> 35:49.805
So I want you to feel the heatof the conflict rising

35:49.847 --> 35:52.805
around you, because you'reholding up the line. Got it?

35:52.805 --> 35:55.722
(beep)Go.

35:57.140 --> 35:59.473
- What does it say? Do I evenwanna know what it says?

35:59.473 --> 36:01.223
- Oh, yes, you do, partner.

36:01.265 --> 36:04.349
"Haggle the cashier for10 cents, claiming youwere short-changed.

36:04.391 --> 36:08.891
"Partner two: escalate thesituation by becoming agitated

36:08.932 --> 36:10.974
and claim to be in a rush."I'll take that one. Easy.

36:10.974 --> 36:13.767
- Cinco Dublin just got chosenfor the losing team.

36:13.808 --> 36:16.225
- I don't think so. I never losewhen there's a prize at stake.

36:16.267 --> 36:20.559
- There's a firsttime for everything.- No, I don't think so.

36:25.143 --> 36:27.559
- $8 and 30 cents.

36:27.601 --> 36:30.602
- Lea Townshend, is that you?

36:30.644 --> 36:34.102
- Wow, Mrs. Musgrave.What are you doing back in town?

36:34.144 --> 36:37.936
- Well, we moved back. Didn'tyour mother tell you?- No.

36:37.978 --> 36:40.436
- I hear your novelis doing great.

36:40.478 --> 36:42.478
- OK, let's not writea novel right now

36:42.478 --> 36:44.145
and keep things moving,shall we?

36:44.145 --> 36:47.104
- You're not listening. One ofus has to go get another item

36:47.146 --> 36:49.187
to hold up the line!- You always do this!

36:49.229 --> 36:51.354
I just said I would goand get some spinach.

36:51.396 --> 36:53.730
- (barely audible): May I havea price check on that?

36:53.772 --> 36:56.938
- (whispering): Louder.She can't hear you.

36:56.980 --> 36:59.313
- (whispering): May I havea price check on that?

36:59.313 --> 37:01.313
- Carol. You can do it.

37:01.313 --> 37:05.231
- It was very nice to see you.- Oh, maybe we can doa ladies' brunch.

37:05.273 --> 37:09.481
- That would be perfect.- That's wonderful. Let's pullout our calendars and set a date

37:09.481 --> 37:13.565
for brunch rightnow. Yeah. Yeah?

37:13.607 --> 37:16.315
- (whispering): Robert, Robert.Glenda. Hi. Hi.

37:16.399 --> 37:18.858
From now on, when youaddress each other,

37:18.941 --> 37:21.650
I want you to usephrases like, "I feel..."

37:21.691 --> 37:23.816
(groaning)

37:23.816 --> 37:27.526
Instead of "you, you, you, you."- 'K, fine, fine, fine, fine.

37:27.567 --> 37:29.401
- Uh, excuse me? Your change.

37:29.442 --> 37:33.484
- If we were moving any slower,I'd be frozen in time.

37:33.484 --> 37:35.902
- I'm sorry, I thinkyou shorted me 10 cents.

37:35.943 --> 37:39.652
- Come on, lady. Lady.- I just counted it.Did you drop it?

37:39.652 --> 37:41.402
- Nope.

37:41.443 --> 37:45.153
- I feel... like an item fromthe frozen foods section,

37:45.194 --> 37:48.611
which is way over on the otherside of the grocery store,

37:48.653 --> 37:51.695
would buy us more timethan the produce,

37:51.779 --> 37:53.695
which is right here.- And I'm feeling

37:53.779 --> 37:56.279
like you're telling mewhat to do.

37:56.320 --> 37:59.738
- Just let mehelp him first, then.- Oh, no, I can't wait for that.

37:59.738 --> 38:02.071
I need my dime right now.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.530
- Lady, it's a dime! Let it go.

38:04.571 --> 38:07.656
- OK, fine!(Cinco clears throat.)

38:07.656 --> 38:09.947
I'm sorry, I am owed

38:09.989 --> 38:12.489
and, um, I cannot letthis store cheat me

38:12.489 --> 38:15.531
out of what is rightfully mine.

38:15.572 --> 38:17.198
- OK!

38:17.240 --> 38:19.615
I'm sorry for being so bossy.

38:19.657 --> 38:22.198
- Apology accepted!

38:22.240 --> 38:23.907
Frozen peas it is.

38:23.948 --> 38:25.908
- Nicely done!- Thank you.

38:25.949 --> 38:28.283
- (high-pitched): Nicely done!

38:28.324 --> 38:31.324
Nicely done.

38:31.366 --> 38:33.367
- Carol, you can do it.

38:33.409 --> 38:38.200
- (shaky): May I havea price check of that?

38:39.492 --> 38:42.368
If you don't have time to checkthe price, it's fine.

38:42.410 --> 38:47.368
I mean, if I were doing yourjob, I would be checkingevery price.

38:47.410 --> 38:49.994
- And maybe a pricecomparison, too.

38:50.036 --> 38:53.827
- Yes. We wanna make surewe get the best deal.

38:53.869 --> 38:56.702
- On those peppers.- Mm. Mm-hmm.

38:56.786 --> 38:58.495
- Lady, come on.Let her check me out,

38:58.537 --> 39:01.328
and then you can have yourprecious 10 cents. Please!

39:01.328 --> 39:04.495
I'm going grey!- Maybe you cantake this 10 cents

39:04.578 --> 39:06.746
and things are just gonnawork out just fine.

39:06.788 --> 39:08.538
- Yeah, you know what, lady?That's very nice of you,

39:08.579 --> 39:12.496
but this woman does notdeserve to be bailed out.

39:14.705 --> 39:17.830
- It's just...if you must know, um...

39:17.872 --> 39:20.164
right beforemy favourite uncle died,

39:20.247 --> 39:22.498
he gave me this reallyold dime and, you know,

39:22.540 --> 39:25.415
dimes just have a very specialmeaning to me since that day.

39:25.498 --> 39:28.623
And, you know, I knowit's silly. It's been,like, 10 years and I should be

39:28.665 --> 39:30.999
over it, but... 10!10, like a dime!

39:31.041 --> 39:34.291
See, that...it's really, it's...

39:34.332 --> 39:36.749
Wow!

39:36.791 --> 39:40.583
Oh, OK. Thank you!

39:40.625 --> 39:43.667
- I feel so bad about yourfavourite dead uncle.

39:43.667 --> 39:45.917
(laughing)That was just genius.

39:45.958 --> 39:49.501
- It was absolutely ridiculous.It was the only thingI could come up with

39:49.543 --> 39:52.168
that wouldn't get me locked upfor being certifiably insane.

39:52.168 --> 39:54.126
You were an awfulperson in there.

39:54.168 --> 39:55.960
- Yes, I was.We made a great team.

39:56.002 --> 39:59.252
- OK, everybody.Very, very good work today.

39:59.294 --> 40:02.085
You all took a major stepforward in confronting conflict

40:02.169 --> 40:05.628
in a very public way. You shouldall be very proud of yourself.

40:05.628 --> 40:08.336
- Thanks. Now hand over theprize, so I can take my wife

40:08.378 --> 40:10.420
to the fanciestrestaurant in town.

40:10.461 --> 40:13.837
- Well, according to my timing,Cinco and Lea actually won.

40:13.879 --> 40:16.171
- They won?How is that possible?

40:16.212 --> 40:18.587
- It's possible by four seconds.(guffawing)

40:18.629 --> 40:22.713
- Uh, well, you know, I reallydon't ever have time to eat,

40:22.755 --> 40:24.547
like, ever. So whydon't you take it?

40:24.588 --> 40:27.631
- Oh, oh, guys, before you go,I have a field assignmentfor you.

40:27.673 --> 40:30.881
So, staying in the same teams,I want you guys to go

40:30.923 --> 40:33.548
and confront the person you havethe most conflict with.

40:33.589 --> 40:36.674
Engage with them and payattention to what itis about them

40:36.674 --> 40:39.590
that triggers it in you.- When do we do it?

40:39.632 --> 40:42.007
- Both team members have tohave it done by next week.

40:42.007 --> 40:44.008
So come on, let's go

40:44.050 --> 40:46.008
- Oh, man.

40:46.050 --> 40:49.050
Well, I'm not sure

40:49.133 --> 40:52.967
why you're not excited. I mean,it can't be me, so it must bebecause you heard

40:53.009 --> 40:55.384
the place stinks.- No, actually,

40:55.426 --> 40:58.634
I heard the place is amazing.- Oh.

40:58.676 --> 41:00.802
So then?

41:02.677 --> 41:06.218
- Uh, I guess we could do...I guess we could do lunch.

41:06.260 --> 41:08.343
- We can do lunch, tomorrow.

41:08.385 --> 41:11.553
That's the kindof homework I like.

41:30.221 --> 41:32.305
(knocking)

41:32.346 --> 41:35.681
- Hard at work already, I see.- Hi...

41:35.764 --> 41:38.389
This is a surprise.

41:38.431 --> 41:43.390
Shouldn't you be at work?- Yes, but...

41:43.473 --> 41:45.848
this can't wait.

41:45.848 --> 41:49.265
Lea, I'm sorry things have beenso strained between us lately.

41:49.307 --> 41:53.474
I know I've been busy and you'vebeen stressed out aboutyour book.

41:53.516 --> 41:55.808
- Yeah, a little bit.- Yeah.

41:55.849 --> 41:58.517
Takes me a while to catch onsometimes, but I get it.

41:58.517 --> 42:01.934
And I think I knowwhat you need right now.

42:01.975 --> 42:04.434
- Really?

42:09.851 --> 42:12.310
A laptop?- Yes!

42:12.351 --> 42:14.268
I know your old desktophas been acting up,

42:14.351 --> 42:16.936
and you would never actuallygo and buy one yourself,

42:16.977 --> 42:19.436
so this morningon my way to work,

42:19.477 --> 42:21.561
I decided, what the heck?

42:21.644 --> 42:23.687
And, well, here you are.

42:23.687 --> 42:27.520
- That's really sweet!Thank you.

42:29.437 --> 42:31.271
- Now I really mustget to campus,

42:31.354 --> 42:34.771
but one more thing: I'm takingyou to lunch on Saturday.

42:34.813 --> 42:38.896
- You, me and the laptop?- I'll email you the details.

42:38.938 --> 42:40.855
So what are you up to today?

42:40.897 --> 42:44.397
- You know, justlocked away in here.

42:44.439 --> 42:47.314
Writing.- Then I won't keep you.

42:47.355 --> 42:49.731
I'll see you Saturday.

42:56.441 --> 42:58.607
(piano music plays)

43:00.524 --> 43:04.275
(phone ringing)- Hello?

43:04.317 --> 43:06.650
- How's it going?-

43:06.692 --> 43:09.108
Maybe he's not coming.Is it wrong to hope he forgot?

43:09.150 --> 43:12.150
- Why are you so nervous?- Because my boyfriendjust bought me

43:12.193 --> 43:14.443
a new laptop this morning, andnow I'm sitting in a restaurant,

43:14.484 --> 43:16.943
waiting for another man.- Relax.

43:16.984 --> 43:20.068
It's just a lunch.It's not like it's a date.

43:23.485 --> 43:26.069
Right?- He's here, I gotta go.

43:28.569 --> 43:32.695
- Sorry I'm late.- Hi.

43:32.778 --> 43:36.403
You look--(small laugh)

43:36.445 --> 43:38.737
- Reservations?

43:38.779 --> 43:41.154
- Um...- Um...

43:41.196 --> 43:43.862
We have these guys.- Oh, you know what?

43:43.904 --> 43:46.030
I thought I had mine,but I don't. Darn it. So...

43:46.030 --> 43:47.988
have a great lunch.- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:48.030 --> 43:50.613
I'm sure that's not gonnamatter. Will that matter?

43:50.697 --> 43:53.113
- Of course not.

43:54.406 --> 43:57.406
- (whispering): It's not a date.- I'm sorry, what's that?

43:57.448 --> 43:59.781
- Uh, I hear the food's great.

44:01.782 --> 44:04.740
- You know, you baffle mea little bit.

44:04.782 --> 44:07.365
I don't know whya woman like you

44:07.449 --> 44:09.740
is in any way unsure of herself.

44:09.782 --> 44:11.866
- A woman like me?What does that mean?

44:11.866 --> 44:14.366
- You're very smart,you're very, very, funny,

44:14.366 --> 44:17.866
and you don't know you're funny,which makes you even funnier.

44:17.908 --> 44:20.576
- I don't think anybody's evercalled me funny before.

44:20.617 --> 44:22.659
- I think you're a riot.

44:22.701 --> 44:26.535
And, uh... you're really,really pretty.

44:26.577 --> 44:29.077
And you have an effect on me.

44:31.660 --> 44:34.327
I think when two peoplehave things in common,

44:34.368 --> 44:38.703
it helps one to see things inoneself a little more easily.

44:38.703 --> 44:41.203
You know?- You are the last person

44:41.203 --> 44:43.537
I can imagine havingsomething in common with.

44:43.537 --> 44:45.620
- Oh, really?We're both very smart,

44:45.662 --> 44:47.787
we both like to reacha lot of people...

44:47.829 --> 44:49.870
You're prettier than I am.(chuckling)

44:49.912 --> 44:52.205
But, you know,we both have father issues.

44:52.205 --> 44:55.496
- I don't.- Really? Marilynled us right there

44:55.538 --> 44:58.746
and you don't want to admitthat? Well, I admit it.

44:58.830 --> 45:01.581
I have father issues.

45:01.581 --> 45:03.789
- Was your father tough?

45:03.872 --> 45:06.372
- Tough, yes.

45:06.414 --> 45:08.540
Brilliant.

45:08.540 --> 45:10.165
Passionate.

45:10.207 --> 45:12.457
- So what's the problembetween you two?

45:12.540 --> 45:14.748
- We only argue,

45:14.832 --> 45:16.416
so now we don't talk.

45:16.458 --> 45:20.291
- Have you ever thought aboutusing a different tacticwith him?

45:20.374 --> 45:21.583
- Like what?

45:21.583 --> 45:25.459
- Have you ever thought ofhugging him?(coughing)

45:28.500 --> 45:32.293
- I'm sorry. Did you just saygive him a... hug?- Uh-huh.

45:32.335 --> 45:35.460
- Clearly, you havenever met my father.- No, but think about it

45:35.501 --> 45:38.793
for a second. The next timehe goes into his usual...

45:38.835 --> 45:41.002
- Attack mode?- ...instead of barking back,

45:41.044 --> 45:43.461
try to diffuse it.- With a hug.

45:43.502 --> 45:45.627
- Yeah. A real hug,a metaphorical hug,

45:45.669 --> 45:47.711
any kind of hug you would like.

45:47.752 --> 45:50.378
- Alright, I'll make thatmy field assignment.

45:50.420 --> 45:53.920
- That's a good choice.- Are you free Saturday morning?

45:53.962 --> 45:55.712
- You want to confront yourfather on a weekend?

45:55.712 --> 45:59.046
Won't that put him off?- He doesn't believein weekends.

45:59.088 --> 46:01.213
He never did, so we're fine.

46:01.213 --> 46:03.879
How about you? Is therea conversation you wanna have

46:03.879 --> 46:06.005
with a certain senatorthat I could be present at?

46:06.047 --> 46:09.464
- No. That would be a very lightand breezy conversation,

46:09.505 --> 46:11.964
so he's definitelynot my assignment.

46:12.005 --> 46:13.840
- OK. How about Edward?

46:13.881 --> 46:17.256
- Edward?What do you mean, Edward?

46:17.298 --> 46:19.298
- Well, wheneverEdward's name comes up,

46:19.340 --> 46:22.091
you get a little agitated,so I'm thinking

46:22.132 --> 46:25.424
maybe there's something you'renot dealing with with Edward,

46:25.466 --> 46:28.549
your second cousin?- No. As I've said before,

46:28.591 --> 46:32.800
and often, I don't have anyproblems with Edward.

46:32.842 --> 46:35.842
And besides, anyways,he's on a skiing trip.

46:35.883 --> 46:38.551
- Wow. New kidney workingthat well, huh?

46:38.551 --> 46:42.551
- Yeah, that side of the familyhas amazing recuperative skills.

46:42.551 --> 46:45.343
- Ah, wow. How about your side?

46:47.177 --> 46:49.177
- You know, I didn'twant to say anything,

46:49.219 --> 46:51.844
but I haven't been feeling sogreat the last few minutes.

46:51.885 --> 46:55.136
So I think I should probably go.

46:55.178 --> 46:57.761
- Can I give you a ride home?- No, I have a car.

46:57.803 --> 47:00.928
- Is there really an Edward?

47:03.179 --> 47:05.012
- Do you thinkI signed myself up

47:05.054 --> 47:07.387
for a conflict management courseand then changed my mind

47:07.387 --> 47:09.304
and then made upa fake relative?

47:09.346 --> 47:11.263
- Yes, I do, becauseyou're one of those people

47:11.305 --> 47:14.388
who doesn't have the heart tohurt anyone's feelings.

47:17.347 --> 47:20.556
- That's very sweet,but not very accurate.

47:20.598 --> 47:22.556
(chair clattering)

47:22.556 --> 47:25.764
(quietly): Excuse me.

47:46.017 --> 47:50.017
- (Cinco):And I just need someone to explain it to me --

47:50.059 --> 47:51.934
this Venus versus Mars equation.

47:51.976 --> 47:55.227
I am so tired of trying to crack that code.

47:55.268 --> 47:57.893
I'm at lunch with a very attractive,

47:57.977 --> 48:00.603
very interesting, intelligent woman, and

48:00.644 --> 48:04.978
though it wasn't technicallya date-date... althoughit was starting

48:05.019 --> 48:06.561
to feel like a bit of a date...

48:06.603 --> 48:08.729
And we have some nice banter going back and forth.

48:08.729 --> 48:10.979
She asks mea whole bunch of questions,

48:11.062 --> 48:13.729
and I ask her some questions,

48:13.729 --> 48:16.062
and BAM!

48:16.104 --> 48:18.813
Out of nowhere,

48:18.855 --> 48:22.230
she makes up anobviously fake excuse

48:22.271 --> 48:24.188
and storms out.

48:24.230 --> 48:27.231
Can someone run that through the

48:27.272 --> 48:30.314
opposite sex app for me,please, and translate?

48:30.356 --> 48:33.690
Please. Anybody. What do you make of this

48:33.732 --> 48:36.023
dance between the sexes?

48:36.065 --> 48:38.232
Caller, you're on the air.

48:38.273 --> 48:42.066
Enlighten me, please? Um...

48:42.066 --> 48:44.858
Hello?

48:44.899 --> 48:47.483
You're on the air,but not for much longer.

48:47.524 --> 48:50.192
- This is Jodie.Jodie Bellarusa?

48:50.234 --> 48:53.692
- Jodie, hi. You sound familiar.

48:53.734 --> 48:55.984
- Well, you know,I'm a regular caller.

48:56.025 --> 48:59.026
- OK. And what are yourthoughts on this topic?

48:59.068 --> 49:01.901
- You know,you're a lot to handle.

49:01.943 --> 49:04.526
You're very, very direct,and while admirable,

49:12.069 --> 49:15.195
to yourself. Maybe that's whatthis person was thinking

49:15.237 --> 49:17.195
when she decided to leave.

49:17.237 --> 49:21.445
- Lea? Is that you?

49:23.238 --> 49:25.071
- No... Who's Lea?

49:25.071 --> 49:28.363
- Lea, if you havesomething to say to me,

49:28.404 --> 49:30.404
just go ahead and say it.

49:30.404 --> 49:32.822
I'm all ears.

49:34.447 --> 49:37.572
We are all listening.(beep)

49:37.572 --> 49:40.615
Jodie? Lea?

49:46.198 --> 49:49.324
(knocking)- OK!

50:01.242 --> 50:03.075
Yes?

50:03.158 --> 50:05.534
- Jodie Bellarusa, I presume.

50:05.534 --> 50:07.951
Cinco Dublin. Nice to meet you.

50:07.993 --> 50:11.076
- What are you doing here?- We have our field assignmentthis morning.

50:11.118 --> 50:13.577
- No, we don't. We do? Today?- Mm-hmm, we do.

50:13.577 --> 50:15.952
So can we do it now, please?Before I change my mind?

50:15.994 --> 50:21.036
Can we go?- Wait, no. I need shoes.

50:22.828 --> 50:25.078
- Uh, Jodie Bellarusa, why doyou keep calling into my show

50:25.078 --> 50:29.079
as somebody else? Am I somebodythat you're afraid to be inconflict with?

50:29.121 --> 50:33.454
- No, I suppose it'sbecause as Lea Townshend,

50:33.496 --> 50:36.079
I always say and do the rightthing, and I really didn't want

50:36.079 --> 50:38.622
to say the right thingto you. Are you mad?

50:38.663 --> 50:40.580
- Listen. My audiencegot a sneak peek

50:40.580 --> 50:43.080
at the soap opera of my personallife, my ratings spiked,

50:43.122 --> 50:45.831
and now my producer wants tomake it a regular thing.

50:45.914 --> 50:48.414
- What? I cannot.Are you kidding?

50:48.456 --> 50:50.623
- I'm kidding!

51:05.083 --> 51:07.666
(phone ringing)

51:09.751 --> 51:13.626
- You ready?- Are you?

51:13.667 --> 51:16.084
- ...important that we all worktogether. We have to keep these

51:16.084 --> 51:18.585
in synchronize. I want it by theend of the week, alright?

51:18.585 --> 51:20.502
Good, thank you.

51:20.543 --> 51:23.585
Well, isn't this a surprise?

51:27.753 --> 51:30.461
- Oh, no. I think this issomething you have to do alone.

51:30.503 --> 51:32.878
Or I could go with you, sure.

51:38.629 --> 51:40.504
Hi, I'm Lea.

51:40.545 --> 51:42.420
- Nice to meet you. I apologize,

51:42.462 --> 51:45.255
but my son caught me off guardwith this ambush.

51:45.296 --> 51:48.255
- Ambush... ambush.

51:49.546 --> 51:53.172
A son can't just drop byand visit his father withouthaving some ulterior motive?

51:53.214 --> 51:56.714
- A son can just drop by, yes,but you never do. Never does.

51:56.756 --> 51:59.047
I think the last timehe dropped by,

51:59.089 --> 52:02.548
he stormed in here and accusedme of sabotaging his radio show.

52:02.590 --> 52:05.590
- You did sabotagemy radio show.

52:05.632 --> 52:07.508
You called in and on the air

52:07.549 --> 52:09.674
you took down... he took downmy whole argument.

52:09.716 --> 52:11.716
- It's called a debate.Google it.

52:11.758 --> 52:15.299
- Ha! Oh... I'm sorry.

52:18.675 --> 52:21.925
- Alright, look. I've gota plane to Boston in an hour.

52:21.967 --> 52:23.926
What do you want?

52:24.010 --> 52:26.676
- To talk.

52:26.718 --> 52:29.218
- Fine. What's the topic?

52:29.260 --> 52:31.718
- Nothing. Just, you know...

52:31.718 --> 52:35.886
talk. Breezy conversation?

52:35.927 --> 52:38.136
- We don't do breezyconversation.

52:38.177 --> 52:41.762
- That's true. You know, I knewit. This was a waste of time.

52:41.845 --> 52:44.470
- You know, for some hotshotwho's made a successful career

52:44.553 --> 52:46.512
out of talking all the time,you're awfully quiet.

52:46.512 --> 52:50.429
Why don't we just agree thatnothing has been added ordropped, and we can both

52:50.429 --> 52:53.513
get on with our day.Does that work for you?

52:53.554 --> 52:56.096
Lea, Lea.

52:56.138 --> 52:59.264
Yes. I'm going to presume thatyou're in a position

52:59.264 --> 53:01.597
to tell me what'sactually going on here.

53:01.597 --> 53:05.765
- Well, sir, I believeI'm here to remind Cinco

53:05.765 --> 53:09.431
that you can't avoidsome things forever.

53:15.974 --> 53:19.016
- What are you...what are you... what?

53:20.557 --> 53:24.767
Oh, boy.(Cinco sighs.)

53:24.767 --> 53:28.600
OK... We're good.

53:28.600 --> 53:32.101
- I love you, Dad.

53:38.144 --> 53:40.769
Thank you forchallenging me to...

53:40.769 --> 53:44.269
be the best man I can be.

53:47.520 --> 53:50.145
- Come here.

53:53.270 --> 53:56.021
(whispering):I love you too, kid.

54:06.313 --> 54:08.813
- You haven't said a word inabout six blocks.

54:08.855 --> 54:11.564
Is this some sortof a record for you?

54:13.106 --> 54:15.231
- I could not have donethat without you.

54:15.273 --> 54:17.689
- I really didn't do anything.

54:17.689 --> 54:19.982
I mean, you would haveconfronted him

54:20.024 --> 54:21.649
no matter who your partner was.

54:21.649 --> 54:24.149
- Yeah, but you hadthe idea to give him a hug.

54:24.190 --> 54:27.065
It was the right idea.

54:27.107 --> 54:28.941
You have a veryunique perspective

54:28.983 --> 54:31.900
on dealing with conflict.Not everyone shares it,

54:31.941 --> 54:33.441
but more people should.

54:33.525 --> 54:36.109
- It's just about being honest.- Hey, you know what?

54:36.151 --> 54:37.776
We're on a roll here, OK?

54:37.776 --> 54:41.234
Who are you in conflict with?Let's go see them right now.

54:41.276 --> 54:43.276
(phone ringing)

54:43.276 --> 54:45.110
(beep)

54:45.152 --> 54:48.443
- Hello?- Lea! Are you alright?

54:48.443 --> 54:51.277
- Hi. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

54:51.318 --> 54:54.194
- It's Saturday. It's noon.

54:54.236 --> 54:56.903
- Oh, my gosh. Lunch.

54:56.944 --> 54:58.819
- You forgot.

54:58.861 --> 55:01.487
- No, I most certainlydid not forget.

55:01.529 --> 55:05.154
Uh... but I did forget,where are you?

55:05.195 --> 55:07.070
- Didn't you read my email?

55:07.112 --> 55:09.738
Forget it. I'll send it againwith the address.

55:09.780 --> 55:11.613
(beep)

55:11.655 --> 55:15.155
- Lunch date?- Uh, yeah, with my publisher.

55:15.196 --> 55:17.239
This book is just all-consuming.

55:17.281 --> 55:20.114
Um, I gotta go.

55:20.156 --> 55:24.197
- Thank you again, Lea.I mean it.

55:25.865 --> 55:28.615
- It was my pleasure. I'm reallyglad everything worked out.

55:28.657 --> 55:31.448
We'll do my, my thing soon.Um, I just have to

55:31.490 --> 55:34.283
figure out where I'm going.

55:34.324 --> 55:36.241
Oh, no.

55:36.283 --> 55:38.491
- Bad news?- Oh, no.

55:38.533 --> 55:40.991
(classical music)

55:45.117 --> 55:48.284
(long exhale)

55:50.285 --> 55:53.118
Sorry, hi.- Hi.

55:53.118 --> 55:55.118
- Welcome back.

55:55.118 --> 55:58.411
- Thanks, but actually,we've never been here before.

56:00.494 --> 56:02.827
- Wow, how did you getreservations here?

56:02.827 --> 56:05.786
- I pulled some strings throughthe university. Is it...

56:05.827 --> 56:08.453
is it too much? I was goingfor something different.

56:08.453 --> 56:10.412
- Couldn't be more different.

56:10.453 --> 56:12.287
And you ordered hors-d'oeuvres.

56:12.328 --> 56:14.328
- No clue what they are,but they were the hardest

56:14.371 --> 56:16.121
thing on the menuto pronounce, so...

56:16.163 --> 56:20.621
- Edward, you're going, like,all out. What's going on?

56:20.663 --> 56:24.289
- I need to talk to you,and if I don't do it now,

56:24.330 --> 56:27.122
I may lose my nerve.

56:27.122 --> 56:30.414
- OK...

56:30.455 --> 56:33.123
- Lea, I...

56:33.123 --> 56:37.123
I can't date you anymore.

56:41.832 --> 56:45.166
- Hi, Mom, Dad.What are you doing here?

56:48.875 --> 56:51.625
(gasp)- Lea Townshend,

56:51.625 --> 56:53.625
will you marry me?

56:53.667 --> 56:56.626
- (quietly): Things are justas they should be.

56:59.543 --> 57:02.543
- Edward, I don't knowwhat to say.

57:02.584 --> 57:05.710
- All you have to say is "yes."

57:08.460 --> 57:10.877
- Yes?

57:10.919 --> 57:14.003
(loud breathing)(clapping)

57:17.836 --> 57:20.128
- Please, come. Yes, sorry.

57:20.170 --> 57:22.921
Phew. Wow.

57:26.087 --> 57:29.172
- Well, all I have to sayis it's about time.

57:29.255 --> 57:32.505
And you are the perfect matchfor Lea, son, and I mean that.

57:32.547 --> 57:37.214
- Thank you, sir.- Lea, we are gonna havesuch fun planning the wedding.

57:37.214 --> 57:39.464
When were you two thinking?- Mom, I just--

57:39.464 --> 57:41.423
- Actually, that's something

57:41.423 --> 57:43.631
that I wanted to talkto all of you about.

57:43.631 --> 57:46.965
My grandmother is turning98 this year,

57:46.965 --> 57:50.257
and she would love nothing morethan to be at our wedding.

57:50.299 --> 57:53.175
Unfortunately, she's beenrather ill this past year

57:53.216 --> 57:57.216
and, well, if it would bealright with you, Lea,

57:57.258 --> 57:59.341
I thought we'd get marriedon her birthday.

57:59.383 --> 58:01.300
- That's very gallantof you, Edward.

58:01.300 --> 58:05.801
- In three weeks.- That's, uh, rather soon

58:05.801 --> 58:10.302
but I don't see any reason whywe couldn't manage it.

58:10.343 --> 58:12.343
Right, Douglas?- But, but, but, but...

58:12.385 --> 58:15.343
three weeks is onlythree weeks away.

58:15.385 --> 58:19.469
- You just say when and whereand I'll be the one in the tux.

58:19.469 --> 58:22.844
(Edward pats Douglas.)- Alright.

58:25.136 --> 58:28.262
- Well, OK. I guess a wholethree weeks it is.

58:28.304 --> 58:32.637
- To Lea Townshend, who will bemy beautiful bride

58:32.679 --> 58:35.471
in just three weeks.

58:35.471 --> 58:38.430
Cheers!- (all): Cheers.

58:38.471 --> 58:40.763
(clinking)

58:51.515 --> 58:53.723
(voices inaudible)

59:03.349 --> 59:05.391
- You sure?- Yes.

59:05.433 --> 59:07.309
- Honey, it's thefirst one you put on.

59:07.309 --> 59:11.309
- I'm only gonna wear it once.- Doesn't that make it special?

59:11.350 --> 59:13.517
(tapping)

59:20.768 --> 59:22.643
- We're going to the mall.

59:22.643 --> 59:24.894
Each of you will return an item

59:24.936 --> 59:28.894
for various reasons, which arelisted on cards in your bags.

59:30.977 --> 59:34.062
- You OK over there?- Mm-hmm. Yep. I'm fine.

59:34.145 --> 59:39.020
- Yeah? 'Cause you look likeyou'd rather have a root canal

59:39.062 --> 59:40.979
than deal with conflict today.

59:41.021 --> 59:44.021
- That would be so niceright about now.

59:44.063 --> 59:46.521
- Now the point of this exercise

59:46.563 --> 59:48.897
is to face anembarrassing situation

59:48.939 --> 59:51.439
with grace and dignity.

59:51.480 --> 59:55.147
This is where it gets exciting.

59:55.230 --> 59:58.356
Come on. Let's go!

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:07.107
OK.- OK, excuse me.

01:00:08.399 --> 01:00:12.149
Hi, I need to return this.I've decided it's too expensive.

01:00:12.191 --> 01:00:14.608
- You've decided now this itemis too expensive?

01:00:14.650 --> 01:00:17.150
- That's right.I can't afford it.

01:00:18.942 --> 01:00:21.192
- Well, if it was damaged,I'd understand...

01:00:21.233 --> 01:00:23.901
but this is an expensivestore. Obviously.

01:00:23.943 --> 01:00:26.068
- I realize that,but you know what?

01:00:26.109 --> 01:00:28.568
That shirt is justnot worth $200.

01:00:28.609 --> 01:00:30.277
- It's a William Rast.

01:00:30.319 --> 01:00:32.985
- I don't really careif it's solid gold.

01:00:33.027 --> 01:00:35.610
- Maybe you shouldn't shop hereif you can't afford it.

01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:39.153
- That's a veryinspired idea, "Sheila."

01:00:39.195 --> 01:00:41.736
Here's another. Could you gofind me your manager?

01:00:41.778 --> 01:00:44.195
- No need.

01:00:49.737 --> 01:00:51.612
Here's your money.

01:00:51.654 --> 01:00:56.113
- Uh, Sheila? Thisis not the full amount.

01:00:56.155 --> 01:00:59.863
- We have a restocking fee.- Mm-hmm, OK.

01:01:01.655 --> 01:01:05.739
Consider that baby restocked.

01:01:05.781 --> 01:01:07.656
- OK, Lea? Lea, Lea,

01:01:07.656 --> 01:01:09.698
Lea, honey.It's just an exercise.

01:01:09.739 --> 01:01:12.074
And you are right on the borderof losing both grace

01:01:12.115 --> 01:01:14.532
and dignity.- I'm sorry.

01:01:14.574 --> 01:01:16.199
I've made a terrible mistake.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.490
- No, no, no, no. There are nomistakes in this class.

01:01:18.532 --> 01:01:20.991
It's just about how we feel--- No, really.

01:01:20.991 --> 01:01:23.408
Seriously. I haven't beenhonest. I haven't been

01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:26.700
honest to any of you.Like, at all.

01:01:31.992 --> 01:01:34.242
- I did not see that coming.- Me neither.

01:01:34.284 --> 01:01:36.160
- I told youshe needed this class.

01:01:36.202 --> 01:01:39.618
- This is a prime example of nothandling yourself with dignity

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:42.827
or grace, when your boyfriendof two years proposes to you,

01:01:42.827 --> 01:01:46.453
and you say yes, when in realityyou really have no idea

01:01:46.494 --> 01:01:48.661
how you feel about him...like, at all.

01:01:48.703 --> 01:01:52.662
- Edward?- Yes.

01:01:52.704 --> 01:01:56.037
Edward and I have beentogether for two years.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.912
He signed me upfor this group. Just me.

01:01:58.995 --> 01:02:02.663
He's the kidney-disease-stricken, second fake-cousin.

01:02:02.663 --> 01:02:05.288
And I made up that whole story

01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:07.163
because I didn't want you guysto know I was being stood up,

01:02:07.246 --> 01:02:10.456
and then I couldn't leavebecause I didn't want todisappoint him.

01:02:10.497 --> 01:02:13.872
- So naturally,you're going to marry him?

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:21.248
- I'm so sorry,

01:02:21.332 --> 01:02:23.665
but you have to excuse me,

01:02:23.707 --> 01:02:27.249
'cause I have a wedding to plan.

01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:41.960
- You were supposedto call me yesterday

01:02:42.001 --> 01:02:45.335
to set a time to look atinvitation samples today?

01:02:45.376 --> 01:02:46.960
- Sorry, Mom. I've just been

01:02:47.001 --> 01:02:49.460
really caught upin the book and stuff.

01:02:49.501 --> 01:02:51.169
- You're hiding.

01:02:51.169 --> 01:02:53.169
(Lea grunts.)The last time you did this

01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:56.044
was when you switchedfrom political science

01:02:56.086 --> 01:02:59.087
to an arts degree and you wereterrified to tell your father.

01:02:59.128 --> 01:03:02.878
So, uh... this time?- Nothing.

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.713
Nothing at all. You walked inwhen I was clearing my head.

01:03:06.796 --> 01:03:09.171
- Well, honey,

01:03:09.171 --> 01:03:12.754
maybe I need somehead-clearing too.

01:03:12.796 --> 01:03:15.672
- What do you mean?What's wrong?

01:03:15.714 --> 01:03:18.547
Is it somethingwith you and Dad?

01:03:20.339 --> 01:03:22.047
(throat clearing)

01:03:22.089 --> 01:03:23.923
- I didn't tell you this before,

01:03:23.965 --> 01:03:27.131
but I was dating somebody elsewhen I met your father.

01:03:27.173 --> 01:03:30.423
He was very nice.His name was Howard.

01:03:30.465 --> 01:03:34.049
He was in medical schooland my father adored him,

01:03:34.091 --> 01:03:37.507
but the only problemwas I didn't.

01:03:37.507 --> 01:03:40.675
I liked him and I just assumed

01:03:40.717 --> 01:03:44.592
that we were probably gonna getmarried. It seemed inevitable.

01:03:44.675 --> 01:03:46.675
But then, um...

01:03:46.675 --> 01:03:49.884
then I went to a freshman party,

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:53.884
and I met this strong-willed,

01:03:53.926 --> 01:03:57.594
opinionated senior...

01:03:57.635 --> 01:03:59.802
who had his heart set

01:03:59.844 --> 01:04:04.178
on a precariouscareer in politics.

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:05.720
- Dad.

01:04:05.761 --> 01:04:10.095
- Oh, I ruffledquite a few feathers.

01:04:11.553 --> 01:04:15.221
But I never regrettedmy decision,

01:04:15.262 --> 01:04:20.638
because it was exactlythat, my darling.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.638
MY decision.

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:26.180
And I often do things

01:04:26.222 --> 01:04:30.389
your father's waybecause I choose to.

01:04:32.889 --> 01:04:35.389
- So you and Dad are very happy.

01:04:37.307 --> 01:04:40.974
- And what I want youto understand

01:04:41.015 --> 01:04:45.475
is that I'm happy in my life...

01:04:46.933 --> 01:04:49.641
but that doesn't mean youhave to do the same thing

01:04:49.683 --> 01:04:52.641
to be happy in yours.

01:05:00.351 --> 01:05:03.143
(upbeat music plays)

01:05:07.143 --> 01:05:10.061
(music stops)- (whispering): Ah, shit.

01:05:11.853 --> 01:05:15.686
I shouldn't thinkeveryone is smarter

01:05:15.686 --> 01:05:18.229
and more talented than me.

01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:20.979
- Excellent.- I'll take the next turn.

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.895
If that's OK.

01:05:26.688 --> 01:05:30.688
- Welcome back.(Lea sighs.)

01:05:30.688 --> 01:05:33.563
- I admit I need this class.

01:05:33.605 --> 01:05:36.356
I'm in an impossible situation.

01:05:36.397 --> 01:05:38.314
I'm actually going throughwith this wedding

01:05:38.356 --> 01:05:40.981
because I can't stop myself.I don't want to hurt

01:05:41.022 --> 01:05:44.398
Edward and I don't wantto embarrass my father.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.898
I can't evendisappoint my publisher.

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:49.023
- It's good, Lea.

01:05:49.023 --> 01:05:51.108
It's really good.You gotta let it out.

01:05:51.149 --> 01:05:55.691
OK. Now let's walk throughan imaginary confrontation.

01:05:55.774 --> 01:05:58.358
OK, I'll be Edward.

01:05:58.399 --> 01:06:00.609
- I'll do it.

01:06:02.984 --> 01:06:06.525
- OK, so wheneveryou're ready, Lea, just...

01:06:06.525 --> 01:06:08.693
just talk from the heart.

01:06:08.693 --> 01:06:11.693
(Lea sighs.)

01:06:11.735 --> 01:06:15.819
- Edward, we need to talk.

01:06:15.861 --> 01:06:18.819
- Is it aboutour upcoming wedding?

01:06:18.861 --> 01:06:21.736
- Yes.

01:06:26.778 --> 01:06:29.028
I can't marry you.

01:06:30.862 --> 01:06:32.529
- Why not?

01:06:32.529 --> 01:06:37.321
- You're a kindand wonderful man,

01:06:37.363 --> 01:06:38.946
but...

01:06:38.988 --> 01:06:42.697
we're just notright for each other.

01:06:42.739 --> 01:06:44.780
- We've been datingfor two years

01:06:44.822 --> 01:06:46.864
and you're justfiguring this out now?

01:06:46.905 --> 01:06:51.031
- Yes. I'm sorry.

01:06:51.031 --> 01:06:54.031
But when you start to thinkabout the rest of your life,

01:06:54.073 --> 01:06:56.824
you wanna make sure you do itwith the right person.

01:06:56.866 --> 01:06:59.324
(Cinco sighs.)

01:07:04.157 --> 01:07:07.367
- What kind of personis the right person?

01:07:07.408 --> 01:07:11.408
- Someone who can see mefor who I clearly am.

01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:15.118
Or at least wants to find outwho I really am.

01:07:15.159 --> 01:07:18.534
(Cinco sighs again.)

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:20.659
- Why did you lie to me?

01:07:26.619 --> 01:07:28.535
- I told you aboutthe kidney thing.

01:07:28.577 --> 01:07:32.370
- I knew that was a completefiction from day one

01:07:32.370 --> 01:07:34.495
and I thought itwas pretty hilarious.

01:07:34.536 --> 01:07:37.036
I'm talking about Edwardbeing your boyfriend.

01:07:37.036 --> 01:07:40.954
- Oh, I toldthe whole class why.

01:07:43.162 --> 01:07:45.371
- After we did my fieldassignment together,

01:07:45.371 --> 01:07:47.705
I thought we'd built up sometrust in each other.

01:07:47.747 --> 01:07:50.830
I let you in.

01:07:50.872 --> 01:07:54.163
You didn't let me in.

01:07:59.539 --> 01:08:01.456
- Probably becauseI'm the type of person

01:08:01.498 --> 01:08:05.040
who doesn't have the heartto hurt someone else.

01:08:05.082 --> 01:08:07.874
- OK. OK, Lea.

01:08:07.874 --> 01:08:09.999
Now are you ready to admit

01:08:09.999 --> 01:08:12.208
who it is you're mostafraid to confront?

01:08:12.291 --> 01:08:16.457
Is it your father? Is it Edward?

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:36.211
- That person is here.

01:09:10.965 --> 01:09:13.381
(door closing)

01:10:09.055 --> 01:10:12.139
(applause)

01:10:31.725 --> 01:10:34.267
(happy sigh)(clapping)

01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:06.312
- You weren't in grouplast night.

01:11:06.354 --> 01:11:09.854
Doesn't that riskyour court order?

01:11:11.604 --> 01:11:13.188
- Did you miss me?

01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:16.105
- Actually, I came to thank youfor what you did.

01:11:16.147 --> 01:11:20.189
It made some thingsfall into place and...

01:11:20.231 --> 01:11:22.689
I finished my book.

01:11:25.064 --> 01:11:28.482
- Well, that's great.That's great.

01:11:32.565 --> 01:11:35.107
Now you can focuson your wedding.

01:11:39.441 --> 01:11:42.858
- I know thissounds crazy, but, um...

01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:48.484
...I can't stopthinking about you.

01:11:53.902 --> 01:11:56.235
- Have you spoken to Edward?

01:11:58.152 --> 01:12:01.944
- You and I,we barely know each other.

01:12:01.986 --> 01:12:05.069
- So what I'm hearing

01:12:05.111 --> 01:12:07.236
is you are stillgonna get married?

01:12:07.236 --> 01:12:10.320
Or you want to knowif you and I have a chance

01:12:10.362 --> 01:12:12.904
before you go and break it off?

01:12:12.987 --> 01:12:16.070
- That's not fair.

01:12:16.112 --> 01:12:20.071
- Sounds like you'rewalking a tightrope.

01:12:24.738 --> 01:12:27.072
The tightrope walkerwho makes it across

01:12:27.072 --> 01:12:29.822
is the one who knowsshe doesn't need a net.

01:12:32.031 --> 01:12:34.532
I'm not goingto be your safety net.

01:12:59.868 --> 01:13:02.076
- Lea! What a nice surprise.

01:13:02.118 --> 01:13:06.368
- Edward, sometimes I needto wear a red dress.

01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:10.952
And sometimes I needto order the flaming pancakes.

01:13:10.994 --> 01:13:13.369
- (stammering): OK.

01:13:13.411 --> 01:13:15.912
- No, but it's not OK.Because when I tried

01:13:15.953 --> 01:13:17.995
those things,it made you uncomfortable.

01:13:18.037 --> 01:13:20.953
- Is everything alright?

01:13:20.995 --> 01:13:23.621
- Yeah, I need to come in.

01:13:33.747 --> 01:13:35.539
- So Lea,

01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:38.122
the promotional team hasread the revised manuscript

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:41.748
and quite frankly,you disappointed them.

01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:45.373
What you wrote is notwhat they said would sell.

01:13:45.415 --> 01:13:48.081
Now this puts me in a bitof an uncomfortable position,

01:13:48.081 --> 01:13:50.999
because the owners of FloraBooks are pushing me

01:13:51.041 --> 01:13:53.541
to terminate your deal.

01:13:57.083 --> 01:13:58.750
- I'd rather not have a deal

01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:02.042
than publish a bookthat isn't my own voice.

01:14:02.083 --> 01:14:05.209
And I'm willing to go into debt

01:14:05.251 --> 01:14:07.334
to repay the advance.

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:11.209
But corporate branding aside,

01:14:11.251 --> 01:14:13.085
just between you and me,

01:14:13.127 --> 01:14:16.127
what did you thinkof the book? Honestly?

01:14:16.169 --> 01:14:19.210
- Honestly?

01:14:19.252 --> 01:14:21.336
Honestly, I think

01:14:21.378 --> 01:14:24.461
it's one of the mostrefreshingly original

01:14:24.503 --> 01:14:27.586
and moving worksthat I've read in years.

01:14:27.586 --> 01:14:31.087
You're a terrific writer, Lea.

01:14:33.754 --> 01:14:36.379
- Thank you.

01:14:36.421 --> 01:14:39.380
And I'm really grateful foreverything you've done for me,

01:14:39.422 --> 01:14:43.297
but yeah, I have to stick true

01:14:43.338 --> 01:14:45.672
to what matters to me most,so if you want

01:14:45.713 --> 01:14:48.464
to drop the release,I'll be gone.

01:14:51.173 --> 01:14:53.839
- Not so fast.

01:14:53.881 --> 01:14:57.049
You know what? Forget thepromotions department.

01:14:57.090 --> 01:15:00.757
Enchanted Summer.Let's do it your way.

01:15:00.799 --> 01:15:04.716
- Actually, I havean idea for a new title.

01:15:09.133 --> 01:15:12.426
- We made it! Congratulations.

01:15:12.467 --> 01:15:15.092
Glenda. Robert.

01:15:15.134 --> 01:15:16.759
Congratulations.

01:15:16.759 --> 01:15:19.052
I just wish we could get backall the hours we lost,

01:15:19.093 --> 01:15:20.927
fighting for the sakeof fighting.

01:15:20.927 --> 01:15:24.468
- Well, we're going on our firstcruise, so it's a start.

01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:27.219
- That sounds great.

01:15:27.261 --> 01:15:29.094
Ernie.

01:15:29.094 --> 01:15:31.428
- Thanks.I got a raise last week.

01:15:31.428 --> 01:15:34.844
- Hey! That's fantastic.Well done.

01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:39.054
Carol.

01:15:39.095 --> 01:15:42.470
- (loudly): I signed up forsinging lessons!

01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:44.721
(cheering)- Hey!

01:15:44.763 --> 01:15:48.096
And Lea.

01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:50.971
Congratulations.- Thank you.

01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:53.972
And my bookcomes out next month,

01:15:54.014 --> 01:15:57.764
but I wanted you allto see the dedication first.

01:15:57.764 --> 01:16:01.640
-"My Life As A Doormat,by Lea Townshend."

01:16:08.683 --> 01:16:11.266
"For Marilyn and thatgroup of strangers

01:16:11.308 --> 01:16:15.266
"that have becometrusted friends.

01:16:15.308 --> 01:16:18.642
This book wouldn't existwithout all of you."

01:16:21.267 --> 01:16:23.850
I hope it's a huge success.

01:16:23.892 --> 01:16:27.185
- Well, that's the thing.It could totally flop

01:16:27.226 --> 01:16:28.935
and disappear without a trace.

01:16:28.976 --> 01:16:31.268
And if that happens I'll cryand eat cake for a month...

01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:33.144
(laughing)- Right, but...

01:16:33.186 --> 01:16:38.019
- ...right, but at least it'stotally and completely me.

01:16:38.061 --> 01:16:40.644
-There's a much larger issuehere and I think it's something

01:16:40.686 --> 01:16:43.187
that your generation's gotta deal with down the line...

01:16:43.228 --> 01:16:45.270
- Hey. I'll be back in time

01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:47.270
to help pack the foodfor my parents' party.

01:16:47.312 --> 01:16:50.063
- Have you seen this week'sbestsellers list?

01:16:50.104 --> 01:16:52.229
- No, I try not to worryabout those things.

01:16:52.271 --> 01:16:54.104
- Well, somebody has to.

01:16:54.104 --> 01:16:57.563
It's gone up two positionssince last week. You did it.

01:16:57.605 --> 01:17:00.105
- Thanks, Kate.(voices arguing)

01:17:00.147 --> 01:17:02.105
- (Cinco):Yeah, but I like sharing with people,

01:17:02.147 --> 01:17:04.730
obviously. I like...- Share with them face-to-face.

01:17:04.772 --> 01:17:06.731
- I love finding out what myfriends are doing, creatively...

01:17:06.773 --> 01:17:09.065
- Oh, I'm sorry.You can just turn it off.

01:17:09.106 --> 01:17:11.065
- Don't worry about it, it's OK.-I love access...

01:17:11.106 --> 01:17:15.149
- See you later.-Hold on a second. I love access to music and opinions.

01:17:15.191 --> 01:17:16.774
Listen.

01:17:16.816 --> 01:17:19.066
I think there's somethingwe can agree on, OK?

01:17:19.107 --> 01:17:22.942
And that is: talkingis still the best form

01:17:22.983 --> 01:17:24.942
of communication. - Absolutely. I do not,

01:17:24.942 --> 01:17:26.983
I do not need-- - Old and primitive as it is.

01:17:27.067 --> 01:17:30.108
-I do not need an emoticonwhen I can see your face.

01:17:30.150 --> 01:17:33.776
- OK, that's the point,beautifully illustrated by

01:17:33.776 --> 01:17:37.526
my father, folks. Thank you.A man of generous spirit

01:17:37.568 --> 01:17:41.610
and wisdom and he grillsa pretty mean T-bone.

01:17:41.652 --> 01:17:43.277
I tell you what. You know what?I'm going to bring you back

01:17:43.319 --> 01:17:45.819
and we'll get into it again.- Ah, you're kicking me out.

01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:48.111
- You like my style.It's been really nice

01:17:48.153 --> 01:17:51.570
finally havingyou on the show, Dad.- It's good to be here.

01:17:51.611 --> 01:17:55.862
-I'm Cinco Dublin. Come back tomorrow and we'll talk.

01:18:04.488 --> 01:18:06.697
- Hi, how are you?

01:18:11.739 --> 01:18:14.489
There you go.Thank you. Bye.

01:18:14.531 --> 01:18:16.698
Hi.

01:18:21.949 --> 01:18:24.490
(dog barking)

01:18:24.574 --> 01:18:27.490
(jazzy music plays)(indistinct chatter)

01:19:06.954 --> 01:19:09.079
- What are you doing here?

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.163
- Well, I just finishedreading your new novel

01:19:12.205 --> 01:19:14.830
and I'm so moved, I, um...

01:19:14.871 --> 01:19:17.914
needed to get an autograph.

01:19:17.956 --> 01:19:19.956
- You were moved.

01:19:19.997 --> 01:19:21.914
- Actually, I was moved.Especially by the ending.

01:19:21.956 --> 01:19:25.539
- Really? That's weird, becauseshe doesn't marry the guyin the end.

01:19:25.622 --> 01:19:28.748
- Exactly. So she's free to meetthe guy that really loves her

01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:31.332
in the sequelthat you're gonna write.

01:19:32.957 --> 01:19:35.874
- So then it's up to me?- Well, why don't you

01:19:35.916 --> 01:19:38.624
invite me in for a drinkand we can discuss it?

01:19:38.666 --> 01:19:40.333
- If my father sees you...

01:19:40.374 --> 01:19:42.875
- (Douglas): What on earthis he doing here?

01:19:42.917 --> 01:19:46.709
- Douglas, your blood pressure.- OK, um, OK.

01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:48.667
Mom, it's OK. Dad? Dad, hi.

01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:51.251
I'd like youto meet Cinco Dublin.

01:19:51.293 --> 01:19:54.210
- Yes, I know whohe is. The question iswhat's he doing in my house?

01:19:54.251 --> 01:19:57.001
- Uh, he's with me.- Well...

01:19:57.043 --> 01:19:58.961
You're friends with this man?

01:19:58.961 --> 01:20:02.586
- Actually, he's somebodyvery special to me

01:20:02.627 --> 01:20:05.461
and because of that, I'd likeyou to give him a chance.

01:20:05.502 --> 01:20:10.045
- Special? So why would you keepsomething like this from me?

01:20:11.795 --> 01:20:14.337
- Probably because I was afraidyou wouldn't approve.

01:20:14.378 --> 01:20:17.546
- You think you needmy approval?

01:20:21.963 --> 01:20:24.505
- Yes, I do.I really, really do.

01:20:24.547 --> 01:20:27.089
But if you don't, we're stillgonna be together anyway,

01:20:27.089 --> 01:20:29.797
so...- And why wouldn't you be?

01:20:29.797 --> 01:20:33.465
You're an adult, sweetie.I only want you to be happy.

01:20:33.506 --> 01:20:35.798
Hey...

01:20:35.798 --> 01:20:38.340
We may never agree on much,

01:20:38.381 --> 01:20:40.299
but if you care for my daughter

01:20:40.341 --> 01:20:45.216
then I imagine we're gonnahave to learn to get along.

01:20:45.257 --> 01:20:48.842
- I appreciate that,sir. Um, I...

01:20:48.883 --> 01:20:53.842
do care very much about her.- Good.

01:20:53.883 --> 01:20:56.509
Welcome.

01:20:58.509 --> 01:21:00.468
(Douglas): I just want to say

01:21:00.468 --> 01:21:03.634
how truly proudthat I am of you,

01:21:03.676 --> 01:21:06.844
not because of the success ofa wonderful book that you wrote,

01:21:06.885 --> 01:21:10.677
or because of thefine woman that you are,

01:21:10.719 --> 01:21:14.386
but because I get to say thankyou for being my daughter.

01:21:14.428 --> 01:21:16.886
- (various): Aww...- To Lea.

01:21:16.928 --> 01:21:19.970
- (all): Lea.

01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:22.887
- Sir, may I say something?

01:21:24.554 --> 01:21:27.721
Thank you.

01:21:30.138 --> 01:21:34.763
My grandparentswere married for 75 years.

01:21:34.805 --> 01:21:38.973
and the love they shared

01:21:38.973 --> 01:21:43.389
is something I spentmost of my life looking for.

01:21:46.932 --> 01:21:50.099
The truth is

01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:52.515
that you can't find love;

01:21:52.557 --> 01:21:54.475
you can only hide from it.

01:21:54.516 --> 01:21:58.558
Whether it's familyor marriage...

01:22:00.141 --> 01:22:02.392
...love finds you.

01:22:06.267 --> 01:22:08.351
My grandfather proposedto my grandmother after

01:22:08.392 --> 01:22:11.143
only two weeks of dating.

01:22:13.893 --> 01:22:16.143
Now you're probably notready to have me propose yet,

01:22:16.185 --> 01:22:18.811
but I do have a question.

01:22:18.853 --> 01:22:23.311
