00:28.294 --> 00:33.004
Hi, there. I'm Draculaura
and, well, I'm a monster.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.737
Ooh, but don't be afraid.
We're not what you think.

00:35.802 --> 00:38.373
We're nice and normal and weird, too,

00:38.438 --> 00:40.847
and we all go to a school together and...

00:41.708 --> 00:45.087
Wait. Let me start from the beginning.

00:46.279 --> 00:49.155
At first, it was just
lonely little me and my dad,

00:49.215 --> 00:52.219
flapping around in our very big, old house.

00:55.054 --> 00:57.056
But then I met Frankie.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.770
And then I met Clawdeen.

01:04.096 --> 01:08.102
And together, we decided
to turn our house into a school.

01:08.168 --> 01:09.609
Monster High!

01:09.669 --> 01:12.650
A place where every monster is welcome.

01:14.040 --> 01:18.617
My dad gave me an ancient monster
transporter called a Mapalogue.

01:21.014 --> 01:24.928
We used it to rescue monsters
from all over the world.

01:28.021 --> 01:30.997
I've made so many fangtastic new friends,

01:31.057 --> 01:34.231
and now Monster High is filled with students.

01:37.230 --> 01:39.506
And you're welcome to join us, too.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.041
All you have to do is...

01:42.101 --> 01:44.172
Draculaura, official Mapalogue emergency!

01:44.237 --> 01:46.148
- We found another ghoul!
- Right.

01:47.106 --> 01:48.380
Come along.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.921
Silvi exto monstrum!

02:21.541 --> 02:23.612
- Come on! Did you see it?
- It's over there.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.316
- Where did it go?
- Have you seen it?

02:54.340 --> 02:55.682
Maybe it climbed the fence?

02:55.742 --> 02:58.120
Nah, wolves can't climb.
Let's check the other side.

03:11.224 --> 03:16.171
Hi! We're your official welcoming committee
and we would just like to say... Huh?

03:17.330 --> 03:18.536
Where is she?

03:18.598 --> 03:19.804
Down here!

03:21.567 --> 03:24.673
Help me, please.
They've got the place surrounded.

03:24.737 --> 03:26.145
- Did you hear that?
- Huh?

03:26.205 --> 03:28.879
- What's going on?
- It sounded electrical?

03:28.941 --> 03:31.182
- So rude!
- I think we'd better do something.

03:31.244 --> 03:34.687
Of course. But will we still
have time for a bite before...

03:34.747 --> 03:37.688
- There! In the alley. Come on!
- Oh? Where did it go?

03:37.750 --> 03:39.286
Ghouls, let's move.

03:46.326 --> 03:49.165
- Whoa. Hey! Is there a blackout?
- What's going on?

03:52.481 --> 03:54.428
What was that?

04:00.039 --> 04:01.450
I see something!

04:06.512 --> 04:08.048
- There!
- Don't let it get away.

04:08.114 --> 04:09.115
Go, go, go, go!

04:13.452 --> 04:14.553
Thank you.

04:14.721 --> 04:16.325
- No worries.
- No problem.

04:16.389 --> 04:17.390
Our pleasure.

04:17.857 --> 04:18.858
Happy to help.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.571
It's what we do.

04:24.230 --> 04:25.470
Who are you?

04:26.565 --> 04:30.238
Hi, we're your official welcoming committee,
and we would just like to say...

04:30.303 --> 04:31.304
Uh...

04:31.371 --> 04:35.012
Ghouls, I think the Normies
figured out they've been tricked.

04:35.074 --> 04:36.075
Time to go.

04:40.113 --> 04:43.390
Don't worry. We're monsters, too.
Obviously. Come on.

04:56.195 --> 05:00.106
Okay. So now, as your
official welcoming committee,

05:00.166 --> 05:02.305
we would just like to say...

05:02.368 --> 05:04.245
Welcome to Monster High!

05:46.112 --> 05:49.389
Frankie is really amped up
about this science project, huh?

05:49.449 --> 05:50.951
Have you seen it? It's, uh...

05:51.017 --> 05:54.360
It's, uh, amazing! Isn't it?

05:54.420 --> 05:57.128
You have no idea what it is, do you?

05:57.190 --> 05:59.295
- Nope.
- Glad I'm not the only one.

05:59.358 --> 06:01.235
What is that thing, anyway?

06:03.529 --> 06:05.702
It's an ultra-high-density
direct current capacitator

06:05.765 --> 06:07.676
for storing high levels of electric energy.

06:09.101 --> 06:10.102
Neat.

06:10.169 --> 06:11.876
It's like a super battery.

06:11.938 --> 06:15.575
I'm trying to put
all that electricity into this.

06:15.641 --> 06:18.551
Imagine only having to charge
your phone once a year!

06:18.611 --> 06:22.115
Oh! And for the Normies,
electricity is everything.

06:22.181 --> 06:25.525
This device is really going to change
their world for the better.

06:25.585 --> 06:27.223
- Amazing!
- Fascinating.

06:27.286 --> 06:29.698
Why would you want to help Normies?

06:31.958 --> 06:34.666
They've never tried to help us.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.597
Eh?

06:37.663 --> 06:39.836
How do you work this thing, anyway?

06:40.549 --> 06:42.852
Moanica, don't touch that, it's not...

06:47.573 --> 06:48.608
Hey.

06:49.609 --> 06:50.713
What?

06:50.776 --> 06:51.948
...done yet.

06:58.684 --> 07:00.186
Hmm.

07:05.825 --> 07:07.736
You wanna go see Ari?
I hear she's performing right now.

07:08.294 --> 07:11.204
Isn't it great?
Just look at all these monsters.

07:11.264 --> 07:15.041
Together, under one roof,
making friends with each other.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.555
Oh, yeah!

07:26.345 --> 07:27.983
Looking good.

07:36.022 --> 07:38.831
And it looks like the new
ghoul even made a friend.

07:38.891 --> 07:41.895
It's hard to believe that
just a few short months ago,

07:41.961 --> 07:44.270
Monster High didn't even exist.

07:44.330 --> 07:48.708
Yeah, it's strange to think that just last
year I was hiding with my pops in Bavaria.

07:48.768 --> 07:50.577
I'd never even seen another monster.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.746
Now I can't even take two steps
without bumping into...

07:53.806 --> 07:54.841
Whoa!

07:56.208 --> 07:59.417
Oh, my ghoul, I am so sorry.
I didn't see you there.

08:00.212 --> 08:02.385
Yeah, I get that a lot.

08:02.448 --> 08:04.985
When you're the daughter of the Boogey Man,

08:05.051 --> 08:08.589
you kind of, well, fade into the shadows.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.224
Fascinating.

08:10.289 --> 08:13.702
You're Twyla, right?
What are you doing here all alone?

08:13.926 --> 08:17.305
Uh, I like to hang out here during lunch.

08:17.396 --> 08:18.500
All by yourself?

08:18.564 --> 08:22.008
Sure, I like my alone time.

08:22.068 --> 08:24.844
Hey, I like alone time, too!

08:25.037 --> 08:27.108
Come with us. We'll be alone together!

08:30.443 --> 08:32.821
- Yes, Ari!
- Sing it, ghoul!

08:37.049 --> 08:39.756
You can always be alone at an Ari concert.

08:40.219 --> 08:41.755
Alone with the music.

08:53.566 --> 08:55.944
Isn't Ari just creeparific, Twyla?

08:56.435 --> 08:57.539
Uh, Twyla?

09:00.473 --> 09:02.510
Guess she's not a music fan.

09:02.575 --> 09:04.248
Maybe she's just shy.

09:04.844 --> 09:06.221
Oh, I feel terrible.

09:06.779 --> 09:09.817
Oh! Oh! We should throw her
a party to apologize.

09:09.882 --> 09:13.159
Yes! Like a really big, big party
and invite the whole school.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.063
Yeah, I would hold off
on those invitations, Draculaura.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.199
Yeah! All right!

09:20.259 --> 09:23.636
Man, I wonder what it's like
to be up on stage like that?

09:23.696 --> 09:27.303
Deuce, we should totally start our own band.

09:27.867 --> 09:31.007
Yes. Yes. I am liking this idea.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.611
Bonesy? Skelly? You in?

09:37.143 --> 09:38.781
Yeah. That's the spirit!

09:40.446 --> 09:42.551
Hey, I play a lot of instruments.

09:42.615 --> 09:46.961
Oh! And I've loved music since I was
a seedling. Can we be in the band?

09:48.220 --> 09:49.756
Oh. And Woolee.

09:49.822 --> 09:52.063
Depends. Can you ghouls do this?

09:56.929 --> 09:58.670
- Oh. They're good.
- They're in.

10:03.602 --> 10:07.243
But while all of us monsters
find spiders like Webby here

10:07.306 --> 10:09.910
to be charming and wonderful creatures...

10:10.476 --> 10:12.080
it is important to remember

10:12.144 --> 10:16.092
that whenever a human sees
a spider, they do this.

10:26.025 --> 10:27.333
Any questions?

10:28.728 --> 10:29.763
Got it.

10:29.829 --> 10:34.874
Very good. Then we are moving on
to our next Humanology subject.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.709
Darkness.

10:36.769 --> 10:41.047
Now, who can tell me what human
beings think about the dark?

10:42.141 --> 10:43.711
- I know! I know!
- I got it!

10:43.776 --> 10:44.948
- I got this one!
- I know.

10:45.010 --> 10:47.456
Professor, Professor Dracula, I know!

10:50.449 --> 10:52.758
- Clawdeen Wolf?
- Huh? Oh! Uh...

10:52.818 --> 10:55.822
They think it's clawesome? Because it is?

10:55.921 --> 10:58.401
Absolutely... wrong.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.364
Humans are scared of the dark.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.538
What's to be scared of?

11:07.600 --> 11:11.173
Look out. There's some darkness behind you.

11:11.737 --> 11:14.946
Yes, yes, I know it's peculiar,
but it's true.

11:15.007 --> 11:18.682
Humans cannot see in the dark
like vampires or werewolves.

11:19.111 --> 11:22.752
Normies are afraid of the dark...

11:22.815 --> 11:24.223
Professor Dracula?

11:24.283 --> 11:26.158
If the humans are so scared,

11:26.218 --> 11:28.664
then why don't they just
suck up a lightbulb like Gob?

11:35.194 --> 11:36.264
Listen up.

11:36.328 --> 11:39.672
You monsters and ghouls
need to take this seriously.

11:39.732 --> 11:44.274
We must learn about humans so that
one day we can happily live together.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.541
Ha! I say we should learn about Normies

11:47.606 --> 11:49.745
so that we can get back at them.

11:49.809 --> 11:52.016
For making us hide in the first place.

11:52.077 --> 11:56.617
Moanica, please take your seat so
we can continue with the lecture.

11:56.682 --> 12:01.290
Oh, I've already heard plenty,
Professor Dracula.

12:01.687 --> 12:06.531
And thank you for the lesson.
It was very enlightening.

12:06.592 --> 12:07.662
Hey!

12:08.160 --> 12:09.696
Come on, Zomboys.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.433
I just got an idea.

12:13.499 --> 12:15.441
Here's a song about a seÃ±orita

12:15.501 --> 12:17.777
You know who I mean
If you be lucky to meet her

12:17.837 --> 12:20.246
Be in the class making a fool of the teacher

12:20.306 --> 12:22.615
Monica no-show ahora lo entiendo

12:22.675 --> 12:24.950
- Oh...
- Always the center in a duro momento

12:25.010 --> 12:27.353
- Hey! Uh..
- Passing the notes for the kids to remember

12:27.413 --> 12:29.288
Top of the class as if you need to ask

12:29.348 --> 12:32.224
She got the lingo, now wait, mi amigos

12:32.284 --> 12:34.560
Let the beat go for me and my amigos

12:34.620 --> 12:36.962
Let the beat go, stamp your feet, yo

12:39.425 --> 12:41.767
Me and my boys don't bother

12:41.827 --> 12:44.136
Let the beat go for me and my amigos

12:44.196 --> 12:46.369
Let the beat go, stamp your feet, yo

12:49.134 --> 12:51.239
Me and my boys don't bother

12:51.303 --> 12:53.806
All the monsters in the school
They'll be coming up

12:53.873 --> 12:56.215
Need to know that there'll be time
to be growing up

12:56.275 --> 12:58.584
Lessons hitting you harder than a coconut

12:58.644 --> 13:01.020
Gotta focus your mind, always be on time

13:01.080 --> 13:03.355
I got plans that only I can ï¬gure out

13:03.415 --> 13:05.554
Got the brains to pull them off
without a doubt

13:05.618 --> 13:08.224
Now's the time to jump on up
And scream and shout

13:08.287 --> 13:10.596
Me and my boys, we're gonna
show you what it's all about

13:10.656 --> 13:12.998
Let the beat go for me and my amigos

13:13.058 --> 13:15.334
Let the beat go, stamp your feet, yo

13:18.230 --> 13:20.172
Me and my boys don't bother

13:20.232 --> 13:22.541
Let the beat go for me and my amigos

13:22.601 --> 13:24.944
Let the beat go, stamp your feet, yo

13:27.473 --> 13:29.817
Me and my boys don't bother

13:35.147 --> 13:38.219
You two, read all those.
You three, gather some of these.

13:38.284 --> 13:39.888
You, get me a mummy mocha.

13:39.985 --> 13:42.625
Hmm. What do you think they're up to?

13:43.188 --> 13:44.997
I don't know. Uh...

13:45.057 --> 13:46.229
Who said that?

13:49.228 --> 13:50.569
Twyla?

13:50.629 --> 13:54.634
Hey. You want me to keep
an eye on those Zomboys for you?

13:55.134 --> 13:57.842
I could see what they're planning.

13:57.903 --> 13:59.278
Hmm.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.808
As class president,
this is my responsibility. But thank you...

14:03.976 --> 14:04.977
Twyla?

14:09.014 --> 14:11.153
Okay, you are really good at that.

14:12.217 --> 14:14.356
Maybe you should keep an eye on them.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.923
But you let me know
as soon as you find anything.

14:16.989 --> 14:18.969
Whatever she's up to, I'll deal with it.

14:19.725 --> 14:22.101
I've got a feeling something
big is on the horizon.

14:23.862 --> 14:24.932
Was that thunder?

14:26.432 --> 14:28.776
Uh, sorry. Runaway drum kit.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.310
We're starting a band.

14:36.508 --> 14:38.613
And she heard a noise.

14:39.578 --> 14:43.219
As she headed down the dark tunnel,

14:43.849 --> 14:47.422
slowly, she turned around.

14:47.486 --> 14:50.490
But what she saw wasn't a ghost at all.

14:51.557 --> 14:52.865
It was...

14:53.525 --> 14:54.526
A human!

14:57.496 --> 14:58.634
You got me.

14:58.697 --> 15:02.042
Come on, Frankie. Let's play truth or scare.

15:02.568 --> 15:03.603
Huh?

15:03.669 --> 15:04.670
Okay.

15:05.838 --> 15:06.873
Truth or scare.

15:06.939 --> 15:07.940
Cleo.

15:08.007 --> 15:09.645
Hmm. Scare.

15:09.708 --> 15:11.051
You have to...

15:12.745 --> 15:14.349
Kiss Webby!

15:25.391 --> 15:26.865
Clawdeen, you're next.

15:26.925 --> 15:28.131
Truth or scare?

15:28.193 --> 15:30.935
Yeah. Um, I'm gonna go with truth.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.305
Oh! I know, I know.
What's your biggest dream?

15:34.366 --> 15:37.575
What do you want to do when we
don't have to hide from the humans?

15:37.669 --> 15:43.176
Well, um, when I was a werepup,
we lived in a dark, dingy den.

15:43.809 --> 15:45.811
There was no style, no art.

15:46.378 --> 15:48.881
But then Monster High found me.

15:48.947 --> 15:50.949
And I discovered how good it made me feel

15:51.016 --> 15:53.997
to be creative and to create for others, too.

15:54.720 --> 15:59.064
So my dream is to open a salon.

15:59.124 --> 16:02.833
A place for everybody,
humans and monsters alike.

16:03.629 --> 16:07.539
And I want to be the head stylist
that makes them all say...

16:11.703 --> 16:12.875
Yeah, nice.

16:12.938 --> 16:15.414
Clawdeen, that's a spooktacular idea.

16:15.474 --> 16:16.646
You should do it.

16:16.708 --> 16:18.745
Yeah. Maybe someday.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.786
Or right now?

16:20.846 --> 16:25.124
Now? What, like, now now?

16:25.184 --> 16:26.185
Think about it.

16:26.251 --> 16:30.458
Opening a salon is the perfect next step
to revealing ourselves to humans.

16:30.522 --> 16:33.230
We could all work there and get to know them.

16:33.292 --> 16:35.397
They'll just think we're in costumes.

16:35.727 --> 16:36.865
She's right.

16:36.929 --> 16:41.240
Nothing makes someone open up
to you like sitting in a salon chair.

16:41.300 --> 16:45.407
But, ghouls. I mean,
where would the salon even go?

16:45.471 --> 16:46.472
I know.

16:46.905 --> 16:49.381
The abandoned power station
where I used to hide.

16:49.441 --> 16:52.513
It's the perfect spot
for such a voltageous idea.

16:52.578 --> 16:56.219
This is all happening so fast.
What if I'm not ready?

16:56.281 --> 16:57.555
You're ready!

17:00.986 --> 17:02.327
Yeah.

17:02.387 --> 17:03.829
Okay. Let's do it.

17:03.889 --> 17:08.300
Let's turn the power station
into a fierce salon.

17:09.560 --> 17:10.561
Yes!

17:26.278 --> 17:27.483
Hmm.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.820
Ta-da!

17:31.450 --> 17:32.793
Um...

17:33.285 --> 17:34.491
It... It looks nice.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.765
And like I should be wearing a hard hat.

17:39.825 --> 17:42.668
I know, I know,
it might not look like much now...

17:42.728 --> 17:44.469
It's perfect.

17:44.530 --> 17:46.438
I can see it now.

17:46.498 --> 17:49.908
Reclining lounge coffins
in the waiting area here,

17:49.968 --> 17:53.245
a row of styling chairs
with crystal skulls over there.

17:54.039 --> 17:56.144
And in that corner, wait for it...

17:57.242 --> 17:58.778
Fog machines!

18:03.615 --> 18:06.721
Hmm. This here and up there... Oh!

18:09.488 --> 18:11.764
We should probably do something about that.

18:14.326 --> 18:17.830
Oh! It's going to take a lot of work
to get this place ready.

18:17.896 --> 18:19.967
You're sure you can do it, Cleo?

18:20.032 --> 18:24.572
My family built towering pyramids
that have stood for eons.

18:25.003 --> 18:26.107
Trust me.

18:26.171 --> 18:28.014
I can do this.

18:31.343 --> 18:32.344
Okay.

18:32.411 --> 18:33.981
Um... Um... Oh.

18:34.947 --> 18:35.982
Uh...

18:36.048 --> 18:37.049
No.

18:38.649 --> 18:40.925
No, no, no, no.

18:45.357 --> 18:46.700
Wrong. All wrong.

18:49.728 --> 18:51.503
No.

18:53.265 --> 18:54.938
No, no, no, no, no, no.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.643
I can't do this!

19:00.038 --> 19:02.143
Everything okay in here, sweet pup?

19:02.608 --> 19:05.111
I'm designing looks
for the salon's big opening night.

19:05.177 --> 19:06.520
But nothing is good enough!

19:07.846 --> 19:10.322
What about this one? This is good.

19:10.382 --> 19:12.055
Mom. That's just a sleeve!

19:12.117 --> 19:14.459
Well, it's a very nice sleeve.

19:16.221 --> 19:17.996
You don't understand!

19:18.056 --> 19:21.435
When we open for the Normies,
everything has to be incredible.

19:21.827 --> 19:22.931
Mmm.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.237
What if nobody likes what I do?

19:27.966 --> 19:31.140
Clawdeen, being creative is hard.

19:31.570 --> 19:35.443
You have to open up your heart
and show it to all the world.

19:35.941 --> 19:37.477
Painful, yes.

19:38.277 --> 19:40.052
But joyful, too.

19:42.381 --> 19:46.488
I believe in you.
You just need to believe in you, too.

19:47.152 --> 19:48.893
You can't rush great art.

19:51.156 --> 19:52.294
You're right.

19:52.958 --> 19:56.301
I have all the time in the world
to make these looks perfect.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.965
Hey, Clawdeen, a question.

19:58.030 --> 20:01.938
Um, is it all right if I tell some of my
old Normie bandmates about the salon?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.570
Well, of course, Ari.

20:03.635 --> 20:06.639
Great. And is it okay
if they post about it online?

20:06.972 --> 20:11.045
Um, sure. I mean, we want a lot
of Normies to come to the salon.

20:11.109 --> 20:14.317
Okay, good. Because all
of that already happened.

20:14.679 --> 20:16.688
And now my fans are posting about it.

20:16.748 --> 20:20.823
And then more fans reposted it.
Again and again.

20:22.220 --> 20:25.425
- Again.
- So you're saying that, uh...

20:25.490 --> 20:28.963
We are going to have hundreds of Normies
at the salon opening this weekend.

20:30.028 --> 20:33.202
Right. Hundreds of Normies. This weekend.

20:33.598 --> 20:35.507
Wait. This weekend?

20:35.567 --> 20:40.346
Everyone was so excited
and then I got excited and... Well.

20:41.039 --> 20:42.481
Now can I panic?

20:42.541 --> 20:46.648
Officially, as your mother,
I'm supposed to say no.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.125
But, yes, I would probably panic.

21:11.403 --> 21:12.473
Huh...

21:33.959 --> 21:35.734
- Hi.
- Hey.

21:35.794 --> 21:38.297
It's Twyla. We need to talk.

21:41.466 --> 21:42.604
Wow.

21:43.034 --> 21:45.571
This is good work. Digging tools...

21:46.338 --> 21:48.045
The tesla coil...

21:48.106 --> 21:49.517
Electrical equipment...

21:50.308 --> 21:55.090
And who has a Zom-bake sale in the
middle of nowhere, during a rainstorm?

21:55.547 --> 21:56.548
Ooh! Brownie!

21:56.615 --> 21:59.459
Don't eat that. I checked.
Yeah, it's, like, 90% dirt.

22:00.952 --> 22:02.659
What could they possibly be up to?

22:04.489 --> 22:09.199
I feel terrible asking,
but can you keep watching them?

22:10.896 --> 22:12.603
It's what I do best.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.644
Just please be careful.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.405
I don't want you to end up
in any kind of danger.

22:19.838 --> 22:20.873
Whoa!

22:23.808 --> 22:25.385
You know, like now, for instance.

22:32.584 --> 22:33.654
Twyla!

22:33.718 --> 22:35.163
I'm okay. I...

23:09.821 --> 23:13.198
You saved me, Frankie. Thank you.

23:13.258 --> 23:14.362
Don't mention it.

23:16.695 --> 23:20.006
Frankie, um, are you okay?

23:21.466 --> 23:24.174
I'm all right.
A little lightning never hurt anybody.

23:24.603 --> 23:26.674
I mean, never hurt a Stein anyway.

23:27.239 --> 23:30.777
But from now on,
what do you say we meet indoors?

23:32.844 --> 23:35.484
Huh. That's never happened before.

23:35.547 --> 23:37.788
Well, that was a lot of lightning.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.355
You're sure you don't need some help?

23:41.019 --> 23:42.225
No, I'm fine.

23:42.621 --> 23:45.564
Listen, we're having another
ghouls' night tonight upstairs.

23:45.624 --> 23:46.625
You want to come?

23:46.691 --> 23:51.002
I think I've already had more
excitement than I can handle.

23:51.062 --> 23:52.063
Thanks, though.

23:52.130 --> 23:56.044
Okay, well, if you change your mind,
you've got my iCoffin number.

24:10.015 --> 24:12.052
Huh? Hmm.

24:30.435 --> 24:31.743
Good morning, Twyla!

24:31.803 --> 24:33.840
That was quite a storm last night, huh?

24:33.905 --> 24:37.751
Yeah. Um, that electricity thing
still happening to you?

24:38.076 --> 24:41.148
It's no big deal.
In fact, I woke up full of energy.

24:41.446 --> 24:43.221
Hmm. Right.

24:43.281 --> 24:46.956
Hey, so I'm going to go spy
on that Zom-bake sale.

24:47.018 --> 24:50.829
I'm pretty sure those guys
are hiding something.

24:50.889 --> 24:52.527
Be sure to call me when you find out.

24:52.591 --> 24:53.865
Of course. I will.

24:54.459 --> 24:56.166
Well, at least it's a nice day.

27:02.870 --> 27:06.643
Hey, guys. The creepateria
has brains for lunch today.

27:06.707 --> 27:09.003
- Brains?
- Brains?

27:09.094 --> 27:11.299
- Brains? Brains?
- Brains? Brains?

27:26.010 --> 27:27.148
Get back to work!

27:27.212 --> 27:29.214
You can sleep when you're dead.

27:29.280 --> 27:32.090
Or, well, you know what I mean.

27:32.150 --> 27:36.860
No more breaks until all
that electricity is in there.

27:37.489 --> 27:41.904
Frankie's science project?
What are they up to?

28:20.231 --> 28:21.471
Come on, ghouls.

28:25.170 --> 28:28.708
I don't care what your boss said, Rene.

28:28.773 --> 28:31.750
That price is outrageous
for cuticle scrapers.

28:32.911 --> 28:34.285
Hey, be careful with that.

28:34.345 --> 28:37.053
Aunt Nephthys hates to be woken up.

28:37.115 --> 28:41.392
Rene, I wasn't born yesterday.
I was born 6,000 years ago.

28:42.754 --> 28:45.792
Don't worry about how that's possible.
Worry about my cuticles.

28:45.857 --> 28:47.832
Hey, mate. Where does this go?

28:47.892 --> 28:49.701
Oh, just over there
by the hair dryers for now.

28:50.061 --> 28:51.062
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

28:51.796 --> 28:52.797
Heel!

28:52.897 --> 28:54.638
That is not a toy.

28:57.335 --> 28:58.336
Ha! Got you!

29:02.207 --> 29:04.687
Hi, this is Twyla. Please leave a message.

29:04.776 --> 29:06.915
Come on, Twyla, why aren't you answering?

29:16.421 --> 29:17.525
Hey, Cleo.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.365
I'm sorry. I know we
have a lot going on here,

29:20.425 --> 29:22.462
but I have to step out for a few.

29:22.560 --> 29:23.868
Everything all right, Frankie?

29:24.362 --> 29:26.433
It's nothing I can't handle on my own.

29:26.497 --> 29:29.000
I just need to check on somebody.

29:29.067 --> 29:30.740
Oh, do whatever you need to do.

29:30.802 --> 29:32.744
Lagoona and I will be fine over here.

29:32.804 --> 29:34.712
We have everything under control.

29:36.808 --> 29:38.287
Excuse me.

29:42.947 --> 29:45.450
Welcome to the very first jam session

29:45.516 --> 29:48.459
of Raythe and the Silent Screams.

29:48.519 --> 29:50.692
And a one and a two and a...

29:51.489 --> 29:53.298
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Wait. Hold up.

29:53.358 --> 29:57.500
We're not calling the band
"Raythe and the Something Something."

29:57.562 --> 30:01.806
Skelly said we were gonna
be The Rolling Bones.

30:06.004 --> 30:08.780
We should name the band
something more powerful.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.787
What about Thunder and Frightening?

30:13.144 --> 30:17.889
No, I like Raythe and the Silent Screams.

30:17.949 --> 30:19.519
Now let's jam.

30:19.617 --> 30:23.394
Um, you can't just name the band
after yourself, Raythe.

30:23.454 --> 30:27.332
One, I'm the lead singer.
Two, it's an awesome name.

30:27.392 --> 30:29.133
Three, let's jam.

30:29.627 --> 30:33.507
Oh! What about Ghoulish Intentions?

30:33.698 --> 30:37.041
Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh! What about
Raythe and the Silent Screams?

30:37.101 --> 30:38.443
Dude, you don't just name the band after you!

30:38.503 --> 30:39.911
What don't you like about
Ghoulish Intentions?

30:39.971 --> 30:42.679
This is a team effort. It's a band.

30:42.774 --> 30:44.879
That's the worst name
in the history of names.

30:46.644 --> 30:48.248
- Whoa!
- Okay.

30:49.881 --> 30:53.351
Look, I'm still the new ghoul here,

30:53.418 --> 30:56.627
but I know this isn't
what Monster High is about.

30:57.055 --> 31:01.333
We didn't start this band to argue
over something as silly as a name.

31:01.893 --> 31:05.932
We're here to make awesome music together.

31:06.798 --> 31:08.744
Monster music.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.943
Silvi's right.
We shouldn't be fighting like this.

31:12.003 --> 31:13.004
My bad.

31:13.071 --> 31:14.744
I'm sorry.

31:15.740 --> 31:19.480
Besides, the band should be
called The Howling Army.

31:20.578 --> 31:21.579
What?

31:21.646 --> 31:23.182
- This is a team effort, man.
- Hey!

31:23.247 --> 31:24.954
- I know what I'm talking about.
- No! You wanna get...

31:25.016 --> 31:27.519
That's the worst name
in the history of names.

31:27.585 --> 31:29.792
The Rolling Bones. Come on!

31:31.822 --> 31:33.524
No peeking.

31:33.758 --> 31:36.295
Okay, ghouls. Here goes.

31:36.661 --> 31:37.702
Clawdeen!

31:37.762 --> 31:39.764
- I knew you could do it, Clawdeen!
- Creeparific.

31:39.831 --> 31:41.333
You really like them?

31:41.432 --> 31:44.641
Mmm-hmm. Oh! I can't wait to wear
these at the salon opening tonight.

31:44.702 --> 31:47.545
- They are fangtastic!
- Thanks.

31:47.605 --> 31:50.916
All my inspiration was thanks
to you and the ghouls.

31:51.542 --> 31:54.485
But I still think there's something missing.

31:54.545 --> 31:57.151
Hey, ghouls, sorry I'm late.
I just got this big burst of energy.

31:57.215 --> 31:59.354
So I decided to walk
around the school 14times,

31:59.417 --> 32:01.727
you know, after I did
the Humanology reading assignment.

32:02.186 --> 32:03.893
Um, who broke Frankie?

32:03.955 --> 32:06.697
And then I did the rest of the reading
for the next two semesters.

32:07.825 --> 32:09.801
Hey, look at that, Clawdeen.
Those looks are so voltageous.

32:09.861 --> 32:10.862
I knew you could do it.

32:10.928 --> 32:13.371
Hey, do I sound like I'm talking fast?
I'm talking fast, aren't I?

32:15.033 --> 32:17.707
Frankie, Frankie! Slow down!

32:17.769 --> 32:19.806
How many mummy mochas did you drink, huh?

32:20.204 --> 32:21.674
Why, I've never been so full of energy.

32:21.739 --> 32:25.077
That's a great idea. I'll go get us all
some mummy mochas. I'll be right back.

32:26.811 --> 32:30.953
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No.
Why don't we sit down for a minute?

32:33.584 --> 32:36.895
It's like there's too much
electricity inside her.

32:37.321 --> 32:38.891
She's all amped up.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.035
Oh, no! My dress!

32:46.130 --> 32:47.165
Wow!

32:52.537 --> 32:54.312
Amazing!

33:03.014 --> 33:04.994
This is what my outfits were missing.

33:05.283 --> 33:09.095
A power station salon
deserves electric fashion.

33:14.459 --> 33:17.839
I'm electric, doing my thing

33:18.296 --> 33:22.038
I'm electric, I'm gonna light it, light it up

33:22.100 --> 33:25.809
I'm electric, sparks of lightning

33:25.870 --> 33:29.680
I'm electric, I'm gonna light it, light it up

33:29.740 --> 33:32.579
I'm electric, can you feel the magic?
Like lightning

33:33.144 --> 33:36.949
I'm electric, I'm electric
I'm gonna light it, light it up

33:37.014 --> 33:40.317
I'm electric, can you feel the magic?
Like lightning

33:40.785 --> 33:44.429
I'm electric, I'm electric
I'm gonna light it, light it up

33:44.489 --> 33:46.297
Shine, shine, shine, everybody got a light

33:46.357 --> 33:48.564
Got to work your dream
and show me that starlight

33:48.626 --> 33:50.264
Every season, I'll touch that...

33:50.328 --> 33:52.436
From your cap to your sneakers
Baby, it's a keeper

33:52.496 --> 33:55.968
Be a leader, don't be a follower
Wear it like a star and everybody holla

33:56.033 --> 33:57.808
When I walk in a room, man,
people be grooving

33:57.869 --> 33:59.789
Who's that girl? It's me, I'm illumin'

34:03.875 --> 34:07.080
I'm electric, can you feel the magic?
Like lightning

34:07.612 --> 34:11.181
I'm electric, I'm electric
I'm gonna light it, light it up

34:11.248 --> 34:14.755
I'm electric, can you feel the magic?
Like lightning

34:15.286 --> 34:19.297
I'm electric, I'm electric
I'm gonna light it, light it up

34:25.295 --> 34:31.371
Presenting Miss Clawdeen
Wolf's Fierce Electric Fashions!

34:33.237 --> 34:35.079
- Look at those ghouls.
- Check it out.

34:35.139 --> 34:36.947
Shock and awesome!

34:37.275 --> 34:40.347
- Shock and awesome.
- Aw, that looks great!

34:40.777 --> 34:42.348
- Awesome.
- Hey, check that out.

34:42.679 --> 34:43.715
That's cool.

34:43.781 --> 34:45.123
- Look at those ghouls.
- Oh, my goodness!

34:45.183 --> 34:47.219
- Bright lights!
- Wow! Check it out!

34:47.284 --> 34:49.856
It's like a party but also a dress!

34:49.920 --> 34:52.161
- So cool!
- Can I get one? Can I get one?

34:52.223 --> 34:53.395
Oh, my gosh. Get me one.

34:53.456 --> 34:54.458
Sweet.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.967
We're really turning some heads.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.231
Hey, Clawdeen.

35:00.298 --> 35:02.972
You look, uh... I mean,
you and the ghouls are like...

35:03.034 --> 35:04.876
You're very, uh...

35:04.936 --> 35:06.979
Did I mention that we started a band?

35:07.705 --> 35:09.343
Thank you, Raythe.

35:16.180 --> 35:18.155
Frankie? Are you okay?

35:18.416 --> 35:22.455
It still feels like there's
a little electricity left in there.

35:23.254 --> 35:24.392
Maybe I can...

35:25.356 --> 35:26.357
Whoa!

35:32.630 --> 35:33.631
Watch out!

35:35.666 --> 35:36.667
Look out! Whoa!

35:42.273 --> 35:43.614
Aww!

35:43.674 --> 35:44.982
Adorbes.

35:45.042 --> 35:46.282
What is it?

35:46.344 --> 35:47.414
Znap!

35:47.478 --> 35:49.116
I guess it's a Znap.

35:49.513 --> 35:50.583
Znap! Znap!

35:51.082 --> 35:53.858
Well, it is very nice to meet you, Znap.

35:55.753 --> 35:56.788
Ooh.

35:57.188 --> 35:59.130
Maybe we can just bow.

35:59.190 --> 36:00.669
Znap, Znap, Znap!

36:00.758 --> 36:02.601
- Hmm. Oh!
- Znap!

36:06.998 --> 36:07.999
Cool.

36:08.399 --> 36:11.275
So, ghouls, now that we have
our fierce new looks,

36:11.335 --> 36:13.177
what do you say we head
over to the power station

36:13.237 --> 36:15.114
and see if Cleo's ready for tonight?

36:17.375 --> 36:20.254
Let me catch up with you.
I have to check on something first.

36:29.787 --> 36:31.926
Twyla? Are you here?

36:37.595 --> 36:39.734
Oh, come on, Twyla. Where are you?

36:43.701 --> 36:45.180
Something's not right.

36:47.972 --> 36:49.610
Hello? Twyla? Are you there?

36:49.674 --> 36:51.119
Ugh. Wrong number.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.964
Are you still fiddling with that thing?

37:08.025 --> 37:09.595
I thought you'd be done by now.

37:11.295 --> 37:12.399
Uh...

37:12.930 --> 37:14.000
Uh...

37:16.801 --> 37:17.905
Uh...

37:33.551 --> 37:35.690
Is it finished? Can we get started?

37:39.023 --> 37:40.865
Ugh! Finally!

37:40.925 --> 37:43.064
I know what you're up to, Moanica.

37:43.127 --> 37:44.697
Oh, really?

37:44.762 --> 37:46.604
You're stealing all the electricity.

37:46.664 --> 37:51.204
I figured it out. I mean,
we're underneath the power station.

38:14.692 --> 38:15.796
Hmm.

38:18.162 --> 38:19.368
Uh-huh.

38:34.345 --> 38:36.347
You're going to use Frankie's science project

38:36.414 --> 38:39.327
to take all the electricity
out of the power grid.

38:39.817 --> 38:44.891
Mira! And they say Frankie
is the ghoul with all the brains.

38:44.955 --> 38:45.990
Brain?

38:47.658 --> 38:50.832
No, there aren't any brains.

38:52.730 --> 38:56.678
You know, you can steal the electricity
to ruin the big salon opening,

38:57.701 --> 39:00.944
but it won't stop those ghouls
from following their dream.

39:02.606 --> 39:08.716
I don't care about their little
"salon" or their "misguided" dream.

39:08.779 --> 39:10.918
Ruining that is just a bonus.

39:11.615 --> 39:17.122
Professor Dracula said that Normies
are afraid of the dark, right?

39:17.455 --> 39:23.133
So when we use this bad boy
to take all of their electricity...

39:23.594 --> 39:25.369
Total darkness!

39:25.896 --> 39:28.873
And when the Normies are good and scared,

39:28.933 --> 39:31.004
the Zomboys and I

39:31.068 --> 39:34.777
will go out into the world and show them

39:34.839 --> 39:39.845
how truly scarifying we monsters can be!

39:40.344 --> 39:41.755
Right, Zomboys?

39:44.982 --> 39:46.393
Hey! Be scary!

39:53.657 --> 39:58.766
This is the Night of the Zomboys!

40:38.369 --> 40:39.541
Impressive...

40:40.037 --> 40:41.038
Fail.

40:47.111 --> 40:49.148
What was that?

40:49.213 --> 40:53.093
I thought you Zomboys said
you knew what you were doing.

40:56.654 --> 40:58.660
Worthless!

41:00.958 --> 41:03.302
I've gotta get some air.

41:14.471 --> 41:15.779
Moanica.

41:15.839 --> 41:17.079
Frankie.

41:17.141 --> 41:20.486
You wouldn't happen to know
where Twyla is, would you?

41:21.078 --> 41:25.458
Who, me? How should I know where
that shadow ghoul likes to sneak?

41:25.950 --> 41:28.225
If you do know where Twyla is...

41:28.285 --> 41:29.286
I'll find out.

41:31.021 --> 41:32.329
Znap, Znap, Znap.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.732
"I'll find out."

41:43.634 --> 41:45.545
Yes, Frankie.

41:46.537 --> 41:48.778
You'll find out where Twyla is.

41:49.473 --> 41:51.419
Time for plan B.

41:56.647 --> 41:59.150
Release the Boogey girl. She's free to go.

42:01.352 --> 42:05.198
No, I'm...  I'm not mad at you anymore.

42:06.023 --> 42:07.832
You're still my Zomboys.

42:11.161 --> 42:14.538
Yes, we can get ice cream after
we finish the Night of the Zomboys.

42:38.122 --> 42:39.897
All right. So it's settled.

42:39.957 --> 42:42.900
The name of the band
is Howling Thunder and Frightening

42:42.960 --> 42:48.433
featuring Raythe and Deuce
and The Rolling Bones and Woolee.

42:50.134 --> 42:52.740
You know there's no way
that's going to fit on a T-shirt.

42:52.803 --> 42:54.476
Hey. Howling Thunder and Frightening

42:54.538 --> 42:56.575
featuring Raythe and Deuce
and The Rolling Bones and Woolee

42:56.640 --> 42:59.280
isn't about T-shirts and making money.

42:59.343 --> 43:02.017
It's about our message
and monster alternative.

43:03.347 --> 43:06.223
Um, monster alternative?

43:06.283 --> 43:09.730
I thought we were going
to be playing heavy metal!

43:11.355 --> 43:16.327
No. HTFFRDATRB's and Woolee
is a Monster Alternative band.

43:16.393 --> 43:17.497
Guys. Guys.

43:17.561 --> 43:20.872
Doesn't it make more sense
for a monster band to play goth rock?

43:21.298 --> 43:24.939
Great, now we don't even agree on
the kind of music we're gonna play?

43:25.002 --> 43:27.278
Bonesy, Skelly, what about you guys?

43:31.542 --> 43:34.386
Smooth jazz? Only my mom likes smooth jazz!

43:34.978 --> 43:37.185
Metal is the only cool kind of music.

43:37.648 --> 43:38.888
- How many times do I have to say it?
- No.

43:38.949 --> 43:42.520
- Monster alternative for sure.
- Goth is totally now!

43:43.220 --> 43:44.221
What? Oh, come on.

43:56.600 --> 43:57.601
Hey, Frankie!

43:58.936 --> 44:00.574
Twyla!

44:00.671 --> 44:03.277
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for...

44:03.373 --> 44:06.815
It's Moanica. She had her Zomboys
dig a tunnel under the power station.

44:06.877 --> 44:08.447
Znap! Znap!

44:08.545 --> 44:09.649
What's that?

44:09.713 --> 44:10.885
Znap, Znap.

44:10.948 --> 44:14.589
I'll explain later.
Why on Earth are they digging a tunnel?

44:14.651 --> 44:17.995
Because she wants to steal
all the electricity, all the light...

44:18.055 --> 44:19.466
Frankie?

44:19.690 --> 44:22.637
Clawdeen. What are you doing here?

44:23.427 --> 44:24.835
I came looking for you.

44:24.895 --> 44:29.236
I can't have our big salon opening without
one of my best ghoul friends there with me.

44:29.299 --> 44:31.472
- No, you shouldn't go back there now...
- Clawdeen.

44:31.535 --> 44:34.478
Your dream is becoming a reality tonight.

44:34.538 --> 44:36.540
You go make sure everything is perfect.

44:36.607 --> 44:37.881
I'll meet you there soon.

44:37.941 --> 44:40.217
Okay. But don't be late.

44:40.644 --> 44:44.488
Oh! I'm so excited, I can't stop howling.

44:50.487 --> 44:53.366
Now, where is this tunnel?

45:01.965 --> 45:05.606
Hmm. That's odd.
There are usually Zomboys here.

45:09.573 --> 45:12.449
Frankie, I know you want
to take care of this on your own,

45:12.509 --> 45:15.853
but listen, that cavern
is swarming with Zomboys.

45:15.913 --> 45:19.224
I am more than capable of
outsmarting a few Zomboys.

45:19.917 --> 45:20.918
Znap!

45:20.984 --> 45:23.260
That salon means everything to Clawdeen.

45:23.554 --> 45:25.761
I'm not letting Moanica ruin her big night.

45:27.157 --> 45:28.158
Okay.

45:29.726 --> 45:30.727
Znap!

45:34.198 --> 45:36.542
Fine, then I'm coming with you.

45:36.967 --> 45:39.948
- So how far down does this go?
- A long way.

45:40.504 --> 45:44.179
It's really dark.
Good thing I'm my own light source.

45:47.945 --> 45:49.887
Hello. Hello, everyone.

45:49.947 --> 45:53.724
Thank you. Thank you all
for coming to our grand opening.

45:54.318 --> 45:58.095
I'd like to introduce Clawdeen Wolf,

45:58.155 --> 46:00.328
up-and-coming style genius.

46:03.660 --> 46:06.038
Welcome to Fierce!

46:06.163 --> 46:07.733
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

46:09.666 --> 46:10.804
This is amazing.

46:10.868 --> 46:12.745
I love the whole monster theme here.

46:13.470 --> 46:15.143
Check out the styling chairs.

46:15.205 --> 46:16.206
Pretty cool.

46:16.273 --> 46:18.651
- Yeah, it's really, out there, you know?
- Great colors.

46:21.311 --> 46:22.786
Whoa! They got a DJ.

46:22.846 --> 46:25.249
- This track is fresh.
- I love it.

46:25.315 --> 46:27.124
I would give this place an 11 out of 10.

46:27.184 --> 46:29.593
Their monster makeup is so realistic!

46:29.653 --> 46:32.963
Forget their makeup.
Did you see those outfits?

46:33.023 --> 46:35.332
They said this was a mummy mocha. Clever.

46:35.392 --> 46:38.998
- Can you do my hair like a werewolf?
- Wow! Look at my monster hair.

46:39.062 --> 46:40.166
Super stylish.

46:40.230 --> 46:42.904
- It's Tash!
- She got a monster makeover.

46:42.966 --> 46:44.604
Oh, that is so cool.

46:44.668 --> 46:46.113
That looks amazing.

46:46.403 --> 46:47.507
Oh, man.

46:47.671 --> 46:49.548
Did you see they have a fog machine?

46:50.741 --> 46:53.050
Check out my hair. This is awesome.

46:53.110 --> 46:56.216
I'm telling all my friends
about their monster style.

47:04.087 --> 47:05.964
Are you sure this looks good?

47:06.523 --> 47:10.096
Absolutely. It makes you look
at least 10,000 years younger.

47:10.761 --> 47:12.798
Uh, I'm not so sure about that...

47:13.463 --> 47:16.603
Hey! Love the new look, Dracula.

47:17.467 --> 47:19.309
Well, what do you know!

47:19.369 --> 47:20.814
So do I!

47:29.112 --> 47:31.989
I'm very proud of you, Clawdeen.

47:32.049 --> 47:33.653
Thanks, Mom.

47:33.717 --> 47:34.718
Something wrong?

47:34.785 --> 47:36.822
Frankie should be here.

47:36.887 --> 47:38.862
Just wondering where she is.

47:38.922 --> 47:41.798
I'm sure she's around here somewhere.

47:41.858 --> 47:43.769
Could you?

48:05.615 --> 48:07.993
Wait! There's lots of Zomboys up ahead.

48:10.787 --> 48:12.528
Seems pretty quiet.

48:19.396 --> 48:20.397
Znap?

48:22.032 --> 48:23.136
Huh?

48:31.274 --> 48:32.844
Frankie!

48:32.909 --> 48:34.388
Be careful!

48:46.089 --> 48:47.295
Znap!

48:48.124 --> 48:49.861
- Let go!
- Znap!

48:53.797 --> 48:57.210
So, what do you think?

48:58.702 --> 48:59.703
Frankie?

48:59.770 --> 49:02.478
I think you ruined my science project!

49:02.773 --> 49:03.877
Oh.

49:04.041 --> 49:07.853
I'm about to ruin much more than that.

49:09.179 --> 49:12.354
I'm taking this whole thing apart
before it can do any more damage.

49:12.416 --> 49:13.890
I don't think so.

49:13.950 --> 49:17.261
It's time for the Night of the Zomboys.

49:19.856 --> 49:22.496
Time for the Normies to be afraid.

49:22.559 --> 49:26.769
And they will be,
when I shut off all the lights!

49:27.931 --> 49:30.571
There are billions of watts
of energy in that power grid.

49:31.034 --> 49:32.308
Obviously there was no way

49:32.369 --> 49:35.248
my project would be able to store
that much electricity.

49:36.105 --> 49:39.009
Yeah, I kinda already
figured that out, thanks.

49:39.076 --> 49:41.385
But that got me thinking

49:41.445 --> 49:46.986
where under earth would I find
something or someone

49:47.050 --> 49:52.193
that is capable of absorbing
that much electricity?

49:52.522 --> 49:53.660
Hmm.

49:54.991 --> 49:56.061
Uh...

50:00.197 --> 50:04.236
You let Twyla go because you knew
she'd lead me down here.

50:04.301 --> 50:06.747
You need me to make your machine work.

50:07.104 --> 50:09.015
Yup. Hmph!

50:17.581 --> 50:19.288
No! Frankie!

50:30.060 --> 50:32.301
Testing. Testing one, two.

50:32.863 --> 50:34.604
Hello, Monster High!

50:34.664 --> 50:37.140
We are Howling Thunder and Frightening

50:37.200 --> 50:40.110
featuring Raythe and Deuce
and The Rolling Bones!

50:40.170 --> 50:41.171
And Woolee.

50:41.238 --> 50:43.445
Who wants to hear some heavy-ish metal

50:43.507 --> 50:48.388
monster alternative goth rock
with subtle undertones of smooth jazz?

50:51.548 --> 50:53.459
And there's some polka in there, too.

50:54.451 --> 50:55.486
Yeah!

50:55.552 --> 50:58.158
I said a one, a two, a one, two...

51:00.924 --> 51:03.400
Uh, guys, we never practiced any songs.

51:03.460 --> 51:05.269
Yeah, I was meaning to bring that up.

51:05.729 --> 51:06.833
Uh...

51:13.003 --> 51:14.004
Whoa!

51:14.571 --> 51:15.572
- Whoa!
- Whoa! What the...

51:15.639 --> 51:16.640
Huh?

51:16.873 --> 51:17.908
Ow! Hey!

51:19.409 --> 51:22.117
- Oh. What's all this, then?
- It's kinda cool!

51:22.779 --> 51:23.814
Nice!

51:24.548 --> 51:27.324
Hey! Where's my electric outfit?

51:38.828 --> 51:40.933
- Is there a blackout?
- What's going on?

51:56.846 --> 51:59.019
What... What?

51:59.082 --> 52:01.323
- Crikey.
- What should we do?

52:03.386 --> 52:04.524
- Excuse me.
- We should get out of here.

52:04.588 --> 52:05.658
Come on, you guys, let's go!

52:06.223 --> 52:08.198
Um, nothing to worry about, people!

52:08.258 --> 52:11.398
Just a little technical difficulty
on our first night.

52:11.461 --> 52:14.704
If I could direct your attention
to the table in the corner...

52:14.764 --> 52:17.574
Please help yourself to some refreshments.

52:20.670 --> 52:22.172
- Whoa!
- This is not okay!

52:41.157 --> 52:42.599
Frankie!

52:42.659 --> 52:45.196
She can't hear you!

53:31.041 --> 53:32.076
Uh...

53:56.299 --> 53:57.403
Huh?

54:10.280 --> 54:11.418
Hey!

54:11.481 --> 54:13.188
- What the...
- Moanica?

54:22.792 --> 54:23.827
Boo!

54:23.893 --> 54:25.429
Zombies! What's happening?

54:25.495 --> 54:26.936
I didn't get my hair done yet!

54:26.996 --> 54:28.634
Are you scared?

54:28.698 --> 54:29.938
Well, you should be!

54:29.999 --> 54:34.470
Because monsters and zombies are real!

54:34.537 --> 54:36.278
And tonight...

54:40.176 --> 54:44.020
Ugh! Will somebody please help him?
Por favor?

54:45.215 --> 54:49.823
And tonight, under the cover
of perpetual darkness,

54:49.886 --> 54:53.763
me and my Zomboys
are going out into your world.

54:53.823 --> 54:58.272
And we're going to do terrible,
scarible things!

54:58.628 --> 54:59.834
That's right!

54:59.896 --> 55:02.467
We're going to tie your shoelaces together!

55:02.532 --> 55:05.206
We're gonna put salt in your sugar bowls!

55:05.268 --> 55:08.943
We're gonna do a lot of this...

55:28.291 --> 55:30.897
That's right, run!

55:30.960 --> 55:36.467
Because this is the Night of the Zomboys!

55:36.533 --> 55:38.535
Moanica! What have you done?

55:44.707 --> 55:46.347
Moanica!

56:50.740 --> 56:53.016
Well, if you don't count the whole

56:53.076 --> 56:57.316
"zombies stealing the electricity
and falling through the floor" thing,

56:57.380 --> 56:59.987
I'd say tonight went pretty well.

57:01.451 --> 57:02.555
Ghouls!

57:02.619 --> 57:04.189
It's Frankie.

57:04.254 --> 57:05.494
Frankie?

57:06.289 --> 57:08.598
Frankie! What happened?

57:08.658 --> 57:11.798
It was Moanica!
She used Frankie for her plan!

57:12.228 --> 57:15.641
So much electricity.

57:15.965 --> 57:18.036
She's in shock!

57:18.101 --> 57:20.410
We have to get all that
electricity out of her.

57:20.470 --> 57:21.949
Znap! Znap!

57:23.406 --> 57:24.714
Znap!

57:26.809 --> 57:28.251
Znap!

57:28.311 --> 57:32.923
Frankie, whatever you did before
to make Znap, can you do it again?

57:39.722 --> 57:42.396
Znap, can you wake her?

57:42.458 --> 57:43.698
Znap?

57:44.928 --> 57:46.464
Znap, Znap!

57:49.566 --> 57:51.341
Znap, Znap...

57:54.470 --> 57:55.642
Znap.

57:58.241 --> 57:59.584
Znap, Znap!

58:01.444 --> 58:02.821
Znap?

58:10.086 --> 58:11.087
Huh?

58:24.334 --> 58:25.813
Hit the deck!

58:27.437 --> 58:28.541
Znap! Znap!

58:28.605 --> 58:29.845
Znap! Znap!

58:29.906 --> 58:30.907
Znap!

58:31.674 --> 58:33.449
Znap! Znap! Znap!

58:34.577 --> 58:36.079
Znap! Znap!

58:38.247 --> 58:39.453
Znap! Znap!

58:40.016 --> 58:41.359
Znap! Znap!

58:44.320 --> 58:45.321
Whoa!

58:53.363 --> 58:54.842
Frankie!

58:55.531 --> 58:56.973
All right, ghoul!

58:57.033 --> 58:58.341
- Frankie!
- You are back!

58:58.401 --> 58:59.778
You're okay!

59:00.303 --> 59:03.182
Aw. Thanks to Znap and you ghouls!

59:05.975 --> 59:08.854
- And you were right, Twyla.
- Oh. Um...

59:09.245 --> 59:11.350
I can't do everything on my own.

59:11.781 --> 59:13.256
Znap!

59:14.117 --> 59:15.858
Znap, Znap, Znap.

59:15.918 --> 59:17.090
You're right, Znap!

59:17.153 --> 59:19.656
With Moanica and the Zomboys
out scaring all the Normies,

59:19.722 --> 59:21.793
there's no way they'll ever trust us.

59:21.858 --> 59:23.098
Unless we do something.

59:23.159 --> 59:26.536
Moanica has hundreds of Zomboys
out scaring those Normies.

59:26.596 --> 59:28.473
It'd take an army to stop them!

59:29.132 --> 59:31.772
Znap! Znap! Znap!

59:38.041 --> 59:39.349
It's...

59:39.409 --> 59:41.184
It's beautiful.

59:50.386 --> 59:51.956
So proud.

01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:10.612
Hey. Ghouls.

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:13.116
Think you could turn the outfits down a bit?

01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:17.587
They're kinda messing up the whole dark
and scary mood we've got going here.

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:19.217
Moanica, stop.

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:21.853
We're not going to stand by
and let you do this.

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:26.725
And you think a few shining, fabulously
designed outfits are going to stop me?

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:27.961
Thank you?

01:00:30.526 --> 01:00:36.406
All right, now either grab a roll
of TP and help us decorate,

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:37.840
or get out of the way.

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:41.871
Because nothing stops
the Night of the Zomboys.

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:42.939
Znap!

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.010
Znap, Znap, Znap.

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:47.076
QuÃ©?

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:48.745
Uh...

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:58.021
Znap!

01:00:58.087 --> 01:01:00.658
Znap!

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:51.775
Hey! What about the Night of the Zomboys?

01:02:26.108 --> 01:02:28.850
That's for making me part
of your evil science project!

01:02:34.383 --> 01:02:35.487
Znap!

01:02:40.056 --> 01:02:41.057
Znap!

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:45.562
Znap!

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:23.272
Aw, come on!

01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:25.241
- Znap!
- Bye-bye!

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:26.803
Have fun running away!

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:29.679
See you at school on Monday!

01:03:29.872 --> 01:03:31.545
Znap! Znap! Znap!

01:03:32.174 --> 01:03:33.744
Znap! Znap! Znap!

01:03:33.809 --> 01:03:34.844
Znap! Znap! Znap!

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:36.254
Znap! Znap! Znap!

01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:58.838
Whoa!

01:03:59.201 --> 01:04:00.771
Whoa!

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:02.347
Sweet!

01:04:02.772 --> 01:04:04.843
Oh! Amazing!

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:09.288
Terrific.

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:12.588
Ooh! Znap!

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.727
Stop that!

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:24.604
You are in so much trouble!

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:32.775
Okay. Here we go.

01:04:32.835 --> 01:04:35.244
Let's clean up this mess you've made.

01:04:35.304 --> 01:04:38.843
Time for Zom-beautification!

01:04:39.408 --> 01:04:41.979
Get it? Zombie beau...

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:43.717
Forget it.

01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:47.684
Znap!

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:54.868
That's a...

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:02.836
Does anyone know how to say
"That's what you get" in Zombie?

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:10.817
Oh. Sorry, mate.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:16.690
Nobody's gonna come back
after that disaster last night.

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:20.822
Maybe, after the salon is fixed up,

01:05:20.883 --> 01:05:25.161
we could have a grand reopening?

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:27.997
Right! Even better than before.

01:05:28.557 --> 01:05:31.231
You ghouls are sweet, but let's face it.

01:05:31.293 --> 01:05:34.433
When those Zomboys popped out of the ground,

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:37.104
my dream was as dead as they are.

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:38.440
Ghouls!

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:41.310
What are you doing just standing around?

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:44.681
Trying to come up
with a new dream for Clawdeen.

01:05:44.807 --> 01:05:47.249
Oh! How about something with music?

01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:49.185
There's a band here at Monster High

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:53.853
and from what I understand,
you do not have to be very good to get in.

01:05:53.916 --> 01:05:56.362
No, I mean, why aren't you getting ready?

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:58.690
Um, remember?

01:05:58.754 --> 01:06:01.697
Last night when the Zomboys
crashed the party?

01:06:01.757 --> 01:06:04.897
I don't think I heard a single one
of them compliment our decorations.

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:08.472
Um, haven't you looked outside?

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:18.346
Beauty! Look at all the Normies!

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:21.149
But the Zomboys... Moanica...

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:24.153
Everyone thought it was
all part of the opening.

01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:25.715
They loved it!

01:06:25.781 --> 01:06:28.489
Your salon is trending all over the Internet.

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:32.328
Monster Style is officially
the next big thing.

01:06:32.388 --> 01:06:34.697
Well, what are we waiting for?

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:37.294
Let's get ready to meet the humans!

01:06:37.359 --> 01:06:40.533
The dream is still alive!

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:32.348
Boo!

01:07:32.414 --> 01:07:33.950
You stink!

01:07:35.484 --> 01:07:37.794
You're terrible!

01:07:45.427 --> 01:07:46.428
Boo!

01:08:27.368 --> 01:08:28.370
Wow!

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:35.292
