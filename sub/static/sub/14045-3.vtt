00:16.100 --> 00:18.595
Come on! Come on!

00:32.639 --> 00:34.819
Team Heather by a hair!

00:36.620 --> 00:38.692
- What?
- No, we totally... we totally had that!

00:38.693 --> 00:40.126
Hey, first rule of emergency medicine...

00:40.129 --> 00:41.695
don't piss off the nurses.

00:41.729 --> 00:42.953
- That breaks all ties.
- Oh, my God.

00:42.977 --> 00:45.068
- I knew I should have been pushing.
- Oh, my God!

00:46.914 --> 00:48.393
Hey, come on. Let me...
let me try that thing.

00:48.417 --> 00:49.884
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Yeah.

00:49.885 --> 00:50.705
Let me try. Let me try.

00:50.706 --> 00:52.137
All right, try to get
out of this choke hold.

00:52.138 --> 00:53.528
Tell me when you think you got me.

00:53.529 --> 00:55.167
Oh, uh, let me... oh, I got you.

00:57.281 --> 00:58.655
Well, that was easy.

00:58.688 --> 01:00.689
Yeah, I guess that's why
you fight MMA and I don't.

01:02.848 --> 01:05.055
I have to say, as an administrator,

01:05.089 --> 01:07.391
these shenanigans would
have driven me nuts.

01:07.425 --> 01:09.634
I am having such a great time.

01:09.760 --> 01:11.719
Who knew this ER could have
such a quiet night, huh?

01:11.720 --> 01:13.782
Wh-What's wrong with you?

01:13.794 --> 01:15.639
Don't... don't ever say the "Q" word.

01:15.664 --> 01:17.659
What, I just...

01:17.760 --> 01:19.695
You don't talk about fight club,

01:19.696 --> 01:20.751
you don't talk about a no-hitter,

01:20.752 --> 01:23.526
and you never, ever mention
the "Q" word in an ER.

01:23.527 --> 01:24.897
You will jinx it.

01:24.915 --> 01:26.809
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

01:28.159 --> 01:29.033
I didn't know!

01:29.046 --> 01:31.100
I haven't told my mom about us yet

01:31.101 --> 01:33.270
because she doesn't understand
why I broke up with Scott

01:33.270 --> 01:34.725
and she knows how hard it was for us

01:34.726 --> 01:35.937
when you got back from the war.

01:35.938 --> 01:38.238
She didn't like me before I went to war.

01:38.887 --> 01:41.337
Hold on, did she really
like Scott that much?

01:41.338 --> 01:43.147
W-well... What can I say?

01:43.148 --> 01:44.940
You know, he called her on mother's day.

01:45.191 --> 01:48.014
Look, all I'm saying is that...

01:48.015 --> 01:50.164
If I tell her now <i>before</i> she leaves,

01:50.165 --> 01:51.718
I'm not gonna get a moment's rest.

01:51.723 --> 01:52.700
And to be honest with you,

01:52.701 --> 01:54.540
I don't feel like dealing with her nagging.

01:54.541 --> 01:57.094
So I just figured that
I would tell her after.

01:58.749 --> 02:00.145
Someone said the "Q" word.

02:00.146 --> 02:02.530
Okay, team, so much for
coasting through the morning.

02:02.531 --> 02:04.094
We have a multi-victim traffic collision,

02:04.095 --> 02:05.442
stragglers filling the waiting room.

02:05.443 --> 02:07.266
- What do you got?
- The first two were in a rollover MVA

02:07.267 --> 02:08.878
when it slammed into
another vehicle in the rain.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.582
- That vic's still on the scene.
- Okay, I got this.

02:10.606 --> 02:12.110
First victim is 18 years old.

02:12.111 --> 02:14.417
He has a deep gash to his left
thigh from the broken glass.

02:14.418 --> 02:15.671
Me and Jordan in Trauma Two.

02:15.672 --> 02:17.546
Victim two was a front-seat passenger.

02:17.547 --> 02:19.756
She's a minor with
blunt-face and chest trauma.

02:19.790 --> 02:21.588
She has mild respiratory distress,

02:21.589 --> 02:22.416
but her sats are holding.

02:22.416 --> 02:24.639
Take the girl into Trauma
One. Krista, you're with me.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.964
Paul and Drew, start working
through the waiting-room patients...

02:26.965 --> 02:28.139
and, Drew, take Ragosa with you.

02:28.140 --> 02:29.686
- Show him the ropes.
- Me? What? Why not Paul?

02:29.710 --> 02:31.148
He's almost as green. You're not.

02:31.182 --> 02:33.324
- Put the girl right here.
- Son of a bitch.

02:34.011 --> 02:36.169
You know I can hear you, right?

02:36.252 --> 02:37.691
Have fun with that.

02:39.441 --> 02:41.119
How's Taylor? Is she okay?

02:41.120 --> 02:42.959
Ah, we're working on her in the other room.

02:42.966 --> 02:44.631
But let's focus on you right now, okay?

02:44.632 --> 02:46.347
I didn't even see the other car.

02:46.382 --> 02:48.563
- Is that driver okay?
- Not here yet.

02:48.564 --> 02:50.002
I'll get you an update when we have one.

02:50.014 --> 02:52.261
Oh, okay, looks like he got
the femoral. I need more gauze.

02:52.262 --> 02:54.310
Jordan, the third MVA
vic is two minutes out.

02:54.311 --> 02:55.414
We got this. Go ahead.

02:55.420 --> 02:56.882
All right, I'll send off a
type and cross for six units.

02:56.883 --> 02:58.297
Get me a large BP cuff
to tourniquet the leg.

02:58.304 --> 02:59.464
There's one in the next room.

03:00.893 --> 03:02.025
How's the boy?

03:02.026 --> 03:05.087
Aah, femoral artery injury.
But TC's on the case.

03:05.088 --> 03:06.771
- Here?
- The jaw's dislocated.

03:06.772 --> 03:08.036
It's obstructing her breathing.

03:08.037 --> 03:09.330
Intubation tray is ready.

03:09.331 --> 03:10.368
I don't think we'll need it.

03:10.373 --> 03:12.021
If we can reduce the jaw,
breathing should be fine.

03:12.022 --> 03:12.506
Just in the next room.

03:12.507 --> 03:13.568
- Call me if you need me.
- Okay, thanks.

03:13.569 --> 03:14.824
1, 2, 3.

03:16.011 --> 03:18.259
Thank you. I've got it from here.

03:18.260 --> 03:19.925
Is this the woman the kid's car ran into?

03:19.926 --> 03:21.724
Yep, approximately 30-year-old female.

03:21.724 --> 03:23.036
Tachy, but otherwise stable.

03:23.051 --> 03:24.842
Paramedic on the scene
found her unconscious

03:24.843 --> 03:26.149
with bleeding scalp lacerations.

03:26.150 --> 03:28.745
- Doctor Chavez has been paged.
- Okay, thank you.

03:31.806 --> 03:33.207
Okay, I need to tie this one off now.

03:33.208 --> 03:34.761
- 4-0 Prolene.
- Okay.

03:34.794 --> 03:35.959
- Oh, hey, Gwen.
- Jordan.

03:35.964 --> 03:37.897
- Hey, Scott.
- 4-0 Prolene.

03:37.930 --> 03:39.592
See you around, Jordan?

03:40.598 --> 03:42.042
Joey's off on some family thing,

03:42.043 --> 03:43.443
and I'm on call, so what do we got here?

03:43.467 --> 03:46.534
Hemodynamically stable, but
came in with a scalp pumper.

03:46.535 --> 03:47.768
I'm placing a purse-string suture,

03:47.769 --> 03:49.135
which should do the trick.

03:49.136 --> 03:50.645
It says here abdominal trauma.

03:50.646 --> 03:53.061
Could be internal bleeding.
I'll check a fast scan.

03:53.068 --> 03:54.025
Ultrasound, please.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.273
Yes, Doctor.

03:56.170 --> 03:58.203
Uh, Jordan?

03:59.251 --> 04:00.200
She's pregnant?

04:00.235 --> 04:02.421
Well, this just got a lot more complicated.

04:02.422 --> 04:03.752
I'd say so.

04:03.786 --> 04:04.819
- Krista, let's go!
- Done.

04:04.843 --> 04:06.436
The tongue depressors
will protect your thumbs

04:06.437 --> 04:08.144
from being bitten off,
but be careful, okay?

04:08.145 --> 04:09.677
Taylor, you're gonna feel some pressure,

04:09.678 --> 04:11.014
but it'll help you breathing, okay?

04:11.015 --> 04:12.980
Just look at me, Taylor.
Everything's gonna be okay.

04:12.981 --> 04:14.095
All right?

04:14.096 --> 04:15.851
Place your thumbs along her bottom teeth,

04:15.852 --> 04:17.607
then push inferior and posterior.

04:17.608 --> 04:19.153
Slow and steady pressure.

04:21.192 --> 04:22.485
Pulse ox is dropping.

04:22.486 --> 04:23.331
Krista, you got to do this.

04:23.337 --> 04:24.878
- Don't make me step in.
- Her jaw isn't moving.

04:24.879 --> 04:25.712
Sats are down to 80.

04:25.713 --> 04:26.808
You have to push harder.

04:26.809 --> 04:28.625
- Now's not now the time to be polite.
- Okay.

04:29.320 --> 04:31.353
It moved! It moved!

04:32.191 --> 04:33.467
Feels back in place.

04:33.479 --> 04:35.336
- Sats are up to 95.
- Nice job, Krista.

04:35.337 --> 04:36.864
- Let's get her to X-ray.
- How's my...

04:36.865 --> 04:37.716
Don't talk, sweetie, okay?

04:37.723 --> 04:38.999
Until we know your jaw's back in place.

04:39.016 --> 04:41.049
- How's my husband?
- Your what?

04:41.050 --> 04:43.315
My husband, Ryan. We
just got married tonight.

04:43.316 --> 04:44.825
What are you, like 14, 15?

04:44.826 --> 04:46.240
I just turned 16.

04:46.241 --> 04:48.613
Do me a favor. Please don't
tell my dad about the marriage.

04:48.613 --> 04:50.597
I don't think he's gonna be happy.

04:50.603 --> 04:51.988
Yeah, that would be my guess.

04:51.989 --> 04:54.183
Things are crazy in there. We got
to keep things running out here.

04:54.188 --> 04:55.818
We just had two new patients come in.

04:55.819 --> 04:57.687
We have one lady
complaining of a kidney stone

04:57.688 --> 05:00.421
and an elderly woman with
an altered mental status.

05:02.175 --> 05:04.933
Paul, you got the Queen
Mother. We got the kidney stone.

05:04.933 --> 05:06.990
Wait, hold on... uh,
this isn't one of those

05:06.991 --> 05:08.359
"old people with STD" pranks, right?

05:08.383 --> 05:10.069
I promise you she's not here for STDs.

05:10.070 --> 05:12.059
In fact, if she has one,
I'll pay you 500 bucks.

05:12.060 --> 05:16.258
Paul, listen, I-I wouldn't go
looking for STDs if I were you.

05:16.259 --> 05:18.481
That's Marilyn Capshaw, the matriarch

05:18.482 --> 05:20.651
of this hospital's biggest donor family.

05:20.652 --> 05:23.246
You mean... oh,
crap... <i>the</i> Capshaws,

05:23.247 --> 05:25.284
like, the ones that fund
the residency program.

05:25.285 --> 05:26.112
Exactly.

05:26.113 --> 05:28.926
The family's a total bunch of
pain-in-the-ass hypochondriacs.

05:28.959 --> 05:30.439
They have made my life a living hell.

05:30.463 --> 05:31.613
You knew.

05:31.648 --> 05:34.111
Of course. I had her sister my first year.

05:34.112 --> 05:36.276
She came in at 3:00 a.m.
nothing wrong with her.

05:36.277 --> 05:37.758
She had me written up as incompetent.

05:39.423 --> 05:40.733
Enjoy.

05:43.811 --> 05:46.365
- Nice move. I did not want...
- Okay, just take this lady's

05:46.366 --> 05:49.338
chart and come get me when you
have a differential diagnosis.

05:52.197 --> 05:53.449
I knew we should
have stopped to rest,

05:53.450 --> 05:56.016
but we wanted to get back before
our parents knew we were gone.

05:56.017 --> 05:58.006
- And you really got married?
- We had to.

05:58.007 --> 05:59.259
Our parents wouldn't let us see each other.

05:59.260 --> 06:01.476
We thought, if we got married,
they couldn't keep us apart.

06:01.481 --> 06:02.536
Uh, I don't think that's how it works.

06:02.537 --> 06:04.047
- I mean, don't you need their permission?
- No.

06:04.048 --> 06:06.738
We found a 24-hour wedding
chapel in Arkansas online,

06:06.739 --> 06:08.002
and you only have to be 16,

06:08.003 --> 06:09.866
- which I turned tonight.
- Note to self.

06:09.867 --> 06:11.656
Don't let daughter anywhere near Arkansas.

06:11.689 --> 06:12.743
Taylor, is that you?!

06:12.778 --> 06:14.172
Oh. Remember, don't tell him I'm married.

06:14.173 --> 06:15.642
I don't want to get in trouble.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.640
I'm her father, Denny Sawyer.

06:17.674 --> 06:19.932
- Taylor, are you okay?
- I'm fine, Daddy, I think.

06:19.933 --> 06:21.485
She's been in an accident.

06:21.486 --> 06:23.361
I'm Doctor Zia. This is Doctor Bell-Hart.

06:23.362 --> 06:24.926
- Hey.
- Your daughter took a pretty good

06:24.927 --> 06:25.627
shot to the head

06:25.628 --> 06:27.834
so, we're gonna get it scanned,
and then we'll know more.

06:27.835 --> 06:30.655
Okay, good. I was scared to
death when I got the phone call.

06:30.656 --> 06:33.128
Well, I'm sorry I scared
you, but it's all okay now.

06:33.161 --> 06:34.602
Well, not everything.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.520
I mean, you're gonna be grounded
for being out at 3:00 a.m.

06:36.529 --> 06:38.070
- Dad, I...
- and that's the last time you stay at

06:38.071 --> 06:40.376
Candace's house. I'm gonna
have a word with her parents

06:40.377 --> 06:41.353
- Excuse me.
- And make sure they understand...

06:41.354 --> 06:42.649
Taylor's friend Ryan
keeps asking to see her.

06:42.650 --> 06:43.397
- Can I get...
- M-Mollie.

06:43.398 --> 06:45.741
- Ryan? Ryan's here?
- Okay, sir, l-let's just...

06:45.742 --> 06:47.690
I told you I didn't want
you seeing that punk Ryan.

06:47.691 --> 06:49.657
And now you're out in the middle of
the night with him, in a car no less?

06:49.658 --> 06:51.120
- Let's settle this after the CAT scan.
- I'm sorry Daddy!

06:51.121 --> 06:52.392
We got married! We had to!

06:52.426 --> 06:54.183
- You gave us no choice.
- Married?!

06:54.218 --> 06:57.178
- How... how do you...
- Okay, Krista, get her in the scanner.

06:57.179 --> 06:59.464
How could you be married?!
You're only 16 years old!

06:59.498 --> 07:01.064
Sir, please, please calm down.

07:01.097 --> 07:02.182
There's plenty of time to be angry.

07:02.183 --> 07:04.375
Let's just make sure
she's okay for now, okay?

07:05.281 --> 07:06.791
All right, first unit is in.

07:06.792 --> 07:07.881
Pressure's up to 84.

07:07.882 --> 07:09.639
Run two more units on the rapid infuser.

07:09.674 --> 07:11.885
I need another 6-0 of silk.

07:11.886 --> 07:13.800
Ryan's parents are here.
They want to see him.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.495
- Just for a minute.
- Okay.

07:16.746 --> 07:18.472
Oh, my God, Ryan.

07:18.506 --> 07:21.054
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Yeah, he's injured his femoral artery,

07:21.055 --> 07:22.812
- but I got the bleeding under control.
- Oh, thank God.

07:22.813 --> 07:24.771
We got the call, and I almost had
a heart attack on the way over here.

07:24.772 --> 07:25.611
Yeah, I understand.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.325
Those late-night calls must
scare the crap out of you.

07:27.326 --> 07:28.487
Listen, he's gonna be okay,

07:28.522 --> 07:29.522
so if you just let me finish...

07:29.523 --> 07:32.825
Harrison, I told you to keep
your son away from my daughter.

07:32.826 --> 07:33.711
What are you doing here?

07:33.712 --> 07:35.080
They went off and got married.

07:35.113 --> 07:37.223
What do you mean, "married"?
Did she get pregnant?

07:37.224 --> 07:38.152
- I'm not talking to you.
- Hey, I'm trying to work here.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.100
- Take it outside.
- I'm talking to him.

07:39.101 --> 07:41.234
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, that's my wife.
- Kenny, take it outside.

07:41.258 --> 07:43.058
I'll talk to her anyway
I want to talk to her.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.385
I'll talk to her any way I want.

08:01.386 --> 08:03.178
I think that's part of the problem.

08:03.184 --> 08:04.676
This is what your daughter learned from!

08:04.677 --> 08:06.241
This is why she cats around Ryan!

08:06.242 --> 08:07.644
No wonder she dresses like a slut!

08:07.645 --> 08:08.327
- You son of a bitch!
- Everybody...

08:08.328 --> 08:09.503
Hey, hey, hey, no! No!

08:09.504 --> 08:10.816
- Hey!
- What are you gonna do about it,

08:10.817 --> 08:11.457
Huh? Huh?

08:11.463 --> 08:13.398
Stop! Look, this is a hospital!

08:13.399 --> 08:14.639
People are working!

08:14.640 --> 08:16.929
Okay? Show some respect!

08:19.551 --> 08:21.751
Now, Ryan's mom and dad, you
can go to the waiting room.

08:21.775 --> 08:24.030
Go on.

08:24.064 --> 08:26.398
Now you go to the cafeteria.

08:28.551 --> 08:29.797
Well done, Kenny.

08:29.798 --> 08:31.871
Didn't have to call security or anything.

08:31.872 --> 08:34.131
These are the only guns I need.

08:34.133 --> 08:36.745
E-even I would look
ripped in your scrub top.

08:36.746 --> 08:39.038
I mean, w-what is this,
like, a boy's small?

08:39.072 --> 08:41.635
Anyway, let me know when Krista
brings Taylor back from CT.

08:41.635 --> 08:45.694
Nobody makes fun of Superman.
He got a tight shirt.

08:45.728 --> 08:46.725
She's waking up.

08:46.726 --> 08:48.612
- Okay. Mm-hmm.
- All set?

08:50.472 --> 08:52.311
My... my baby! How's my baby?!

08:52.318 --> 08:54.158
Your baby's doing great, okay?

08:54.159 --> 08:55.928
Look, see?

08:55.929 --> 08:58.246
I'm Doctor Alexander, and
this is Doctor Clemens.

08:58.247 --> 08:59.771
And we'd like to do a scan of your brain.

08:59.772 --> 09:01.977
No. My brain is fine,
okay? I don't want to expose

09:01.977 --> 09:03.615
- my baby to any radiation.
- I agree.

09:03.616 --> 09:05.756
And that's why I'm going to
use the ultrasound machine

09:05.790 --> 09:07.142
to check the pressure in your brain...

09:07.166 --> 09:09.214
make sure it's okay, there's no bleeding.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.997
And it is 100% safe for your baby.

09:13.518 --> 09:14.428
Yeah.

09:14.462 --> 09:16.412
Okay. Okay.

09:16.447 --> 09:18.578
- Okay.
- That's fine.

09:18.579 --> 09:20.245
I'm sorry to be such a pain.

09:20.246 --> 09:21.528
I just want to protect my baby.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.751
Okay, go ahead and close your eyes for me.

09:23.752 --> 09:25.476
This might feel a little funny.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.524
Hmm. This is a great idea, Scott.

09:30.558 --> 09:32.319
Yeah, I've been known to have a few.

09:33.383 --> 09:35.372
So, your fiancé's in the army?

09:35.373 --> 09:37.847
Yeah, yeah, he's a corporal stationed

09:37.848 --> 09:39.452
at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany.

09:39.486 --> 09:41.619
We're getting married once he gets back,

09:41.620 --> 09:43.299
- you know, before she's born.
- That's great.

09:43.300 --> 09:45.541
Okay, it looks like the
diameter of your optic nerve

09:45.547 --> 09:46.871
is well within normal limits,

09:46.872 --> 09:48.585
so I would say you are good to go.

09:48.586 --> 09:51.366
- Okay. Thanks for understanding.
- Well, what can I say?

09:51.367 --> 09:53.309
I'm an understanding kind of guy.

09:55.033 --> 09:56.662
Ow! Ow, ow!

09:56.663 --> 09:57.753
Is everything okay?

09:57.754 --> 10:00.028
Yeah, yeah. She's just kicking, you know...

10:00.062 --> 10:03.136
Do you mind calling
my fiancé and just explaining

10:03.142 --> 10:05.179
- to him what's going on?
- I'd be glad to.

10:05.180 --> 10:07.292
Next time, don't make us wait as long.

10:07.326 --> 10:09.268
I need you to do every
test here immediately,

10:09.269 --> 10:10.929
and I do not want to have
to wait for the results.

10:10.930 --> 10:12.098
- You understand?
- Uh, yes, s-sir.

10:12.099 --> 10:14.493
She's been off lately,
but it got so bad tonight

10:14.494 --> 10:15.690
I couldn't deal with it anymore.

10:15.691 --> 10:18.148
I'm expecting a precise
diagnosis by morning.

10:18.149 --> 10:20.492
- Uh, yeah.
- You're a beautiful dancer.

10:21.116 --> 10:22.428
Do you know how to rumba?

10:22.462 --> 10:25.308
See what I mean? Here are her things.

10:25.342 --> 10:26.652
I'll be checking in.

10:26.686 --> 10:30.108
Mother, I'll be back in a few hours.

10:30.402 --> 10:34.396
Uh, this way, please. After you.

10:34.430 --> 10:36.646
Mm, soft as a baby.

10:37.108 --> 10:38.278
What are you doing, cruising Tinder?

10:38.302 --> 10:39.865
Yeah, I'm trying to get in
touch with Chloe's fiancé,

10:39.866 --> 10:41.534
but I keep getting his voice-mail.

10:41.534 --> 10:42.828
I'm gonna have to get one of the nurses

10:42.829 --> 10:44.099
to track him down for her.

10:44.106 --> 10:45.453
Hey, let me do it.

10:45.454 --> 10:47.451
They're still working.
I just got off my shift.

10:47.452 --> 10:48.847
You don't want to go home?

10:48.848 --> 10:50.236
To an empty apartment?

10:50.270 --> 10:52.796
I'd rather stay and help the pregnant girl.

10:52.830 --> 10:54.561
Nice to know someone
who's getting laid, huh?

10:54.562 --> 10:56.572
- All right, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

10:57.326 --> 11:00.812
All right, now I would like
you to follow my finger, okay?

11:02.318 --> 11:05.484
All right, and now...
a-and repeat after me.

11:05.517 --> 11:07.564
"No ifs, ands, or buts."

11:07.597 --> 11:11.340
No ifs, and you have a nice butt.

11:11.373 --> 11:13.449
Okay, all right.

11:13.450 --> 11:15.979
Let's, uh... let's try
and focus, all right? Okay.

11:16.013 --> 11:17.739
Um, name as many animals as you can

11:17.774 --> 11:19.115
in 30 seconds, all right?

11:19.149 --> 11:20.875
And... Go.

11:20.910 --> 11:22.156
- Zebra.
- Mm-hmm.

11:22.189 --> 11:23.884
Coyote. Coyote.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.947
I suppose you're too young
to remember Wile E. Coyote.

11:27.982 --> 11:29.099
No, I'm actually... I-I...

11:29.134 --> 11:31.660
always trying to catch
that damn roadrunner,

11:31.693 --> 11:33.293
but he never could.

11:33.294 --> 11:35.916
Beep, beep! That's the
sound Road Runner made.

11:35.949 --> 11:37.164
Beep, beep!

11:37.197 --> 11:38.766
- Beep, beep!
- All right. No, I... no, I get it.

11:38.767 --> 11:40.169
- I... that's sweet. Yeah.
- Oh, but I like it.

11:40.170 --> 11:41.547
How's it going teaching Ragosa?

11:41.581 --> 11:44.272
Ohh, if it was any other
physician's assistant,

11:44.273 --> 11:45.458
I wouldn't mind babysitting.

11:45.459 --> 11:47.838
But that guy, he's always
been such a pain in our asses.

11:47.839 --> 11:49.168
Oh, come on. He's not that bad.

11:49.169 --> 11:50.987
You just have to get to know him.

11:51.022 --> 11:52.907
Yeah, that's right on
the top of my to-do list.

11:52.942 --> 11:54.356
Hey, Jordan?

11:55.961 --> 11:57.895
So, that cell number that Chloe gave us

11:57.896 --> 11:59.017
is still going to voice-mail.

11:59.018 --> 12:01.463
I left a message to call,
but there's also no record

12:01.464 --> 12:03.179
of Chloe's fiancé ever being at Ramstein.

12:03.213 --> 12:03.980
Never heard of him.

12:03.981 --> 12:06.234
Well, maybe the guy wanted
out, so he just lied.

12:06.235 --> 12:07.918
Wouldn't be the first
time someone got scared off

12:07.919 --> 12:11.599
by a baby or lied about
ending a relationship.

12:12.765 --> 12:14.461
My gut tells me that's not the case.

12:14.462 --> 12:16.170
Uh, why don't you try calling
Fort Hood and see if...

12:16.171 --> 12:17.578
If he was deployed in the Middle East.

12:17.579 --> 12:18.358
I know right where you're headed.

12:18.359 --> 12:19.820
Thank you.

12:20.331 --> 12:20.828
Hey, Scott.

12:20.829 --> 12:23.571
- Hmm?
- Uh, do we need to talk?

12:23.572 --> 12:27.040
'Cause I feel like you're taking
these not-so-subtle jabs at me.

12:27.041 --> 12:29.161
No. No, no, no. Not at all.

12:29.195 --> 12:30.004
No, no, I was...

12:30.005 --> 12:33.159
I was talking about Chloe
and her situation, not ours.

12:33.160 --> 12:36.336
Look, was I pissed at first? Yes, I was.

12:36.337 --> 12:37.793
Was I hurt? Yeah.

12:37.794 --> 12:39.436
But trust me, I am more than fine

12:39.437 --> 12:41.225
with how everything's worked out, okay?

12:41.259 --> 12:42.537
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:42.571 --> 12:44.015
I'll go page OB for you.

12:44.016 --> 12:45.784
Thank you.

12:50.207 --> 12:51.799
Hey. Look who's awake.

12:52.485 --> 12:53.581
How are you feeling?

12:53.600 --> 12:57.362
Terrible. How's my wife, Taylor?

12:57.363 --> 12:59.966
You wife is getting some tests.

13:00.001 --> 13:01.641
And just so you know,
your parents are here.

13:01.665 --> 13:02.623
And her dad.

13:02.656 --> 13:04.423
Nobody seemed particularly happy.

13:04.424 --> 13:06.598
- Her dad?
- Yeah.

13:06.599 --> 13:08.287
He just hates me because we're rich.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.477
Well, I don't think your marriage

13:10.478 --> 13:12.063
is gonna do your case any favors.

13:13.312 --> 13:15.199
- Is this Ryan Harrison?
- Yeah.

13:15.232 --> 13:16.958
Yeah, he's stable. You can talk to him.

13:16.992 --> 13:19.095
Just for a few minutes, though.

13:19.119 --> 13:20.767
Uh, Officer, this is my son.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.262
It was my car that he wrecked in the crash.

13:22.263 --> 13:24.239
Uh, here's our insurance
card. Anything else you need?

13:24.240 --> 13:26.078
I'm not here about the car.

13:26.112 --> 13:29.114
Ryan Harrison, you are under arrest
for the sexual assault of a minor.

13:29.115 --> 13:30.067
Get those off my boy.

13:30.079 --> 13:31.889
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Get those off me. You can't arrest me.

13:31.894 --> 13:32.548
- We're married. It's not illegal.
- Anything you do say can and will be used

13:32.559 --> 13:34.171
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hang on.
- Against you in the court of law.

13:34.172 --> 13:35.663
- What's going on?
- Dad, help me! Get these off me!

13:35.664 --> 13:36.705
You have a right to an attorney. If you
cannot afford an attorney, one will be

13:36.729 --> 13:38.879
provided to you. Do you understand
these rights as I have read them to you?

13:38.880 --> 13:40.611
Please! Dad, she's my wife! Help me.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.295
- Ow! Ow! My baby!
- What happened?

13:44.296 --> 13:45.428
I'm not sure. I found her like this.

13:45.428 --> 13:47.729
It's my stomach!

13:47.730 --> 13:49.365
Hey, Kenny, start her on morphine.

13:49.366 --> 13:51.734
Chloe? Chloe, these are contractions.

13:51.735 --> 13:53.545
- You're in labor.
- No, no, no!

13:53.546 --> 13:55.302
It's not... it's not time.
It's too early for the baby.

13:55.303 --> 13:57.141
We can try to slow the contractions down.

13:57.142 --> 13:59.005
But, honey, worst case,

13:59.006 --> 14:00.924
your baby's far enough along to be viable.

14:00.925 --> 14:02.069
- No.
- All right, morphine's in.

14:02.070 --> 14:03.484
- Thank you.
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

14:03.485 --> 14:04.930
- Why is this happening?
- Okay.

14:04.931 --> 14:05.948
Look, I promised my dad

14:05.949 --> 14:07.332
I'd be married before I had the baby.

14:07.333 --> 14:08.625
I'm sure he'll understand.

14:08.626 --> 14:10.986
No! He died last month!

14:10.987 --> 14:12.934
Look, I can't break my promise to him!

14:12.935 --> 14:14.372
Please, it would crush my mom!

14:14.373 --> 14:17.123
Chloe, I am so sorry.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.117
Honey, the best thing you can do right now

14:19.118 --> 14:20.707
is try to focus on staying calm,

14:20.741 --> 14:22.605
'cause that's what's best
for you and your baby.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.121
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay?

14:24.122 --> 14:26.115
- Kenny, start a mag sulfate infusion.
- On it.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.783
I don't want to do this alone.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.923
You're gonna be great. It's okay.

14:29.957 --> 14:32.623
Now, Deputy, you don't need
to escalate this, all right?

14:32.624 --> 14:34.475
He just wants to know what's
happening with his son.

14:34.476 --> 14:36.184
He's an 18-year-old having
sex with a 15-year-old.

14:36.189 --> 14:37.196
She's 16.

14:37.196 --> 14:38.160
Oh, and that makes it okay for you?

14:38.161 --> 14:39.857
You son of a bitch. You
did this, didn't you?

14:39.858 --> 14:40.793
You're damn right I did.

14:40.794 --> 14:43.293
I told you to keep your
son away from my daughter.

14:43.294 --> 14:44.384
And you wouldn't, so I will.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.217
- This will ruin Ryan's life.
- His life?

14:46.218 --> 14:49.154
His life is set! He's got
a BMW and a trust fund.

14:49.155 --> 14:51.728
My Taylor was at the top of
her class until she started

14:51.729 --> 14:53.118
- running around with your son.
- Whoa, whoa, <i>she's</i> chasing <i>him!</i>

14:53.119 --> 14:55.149
And he quit the baseball team
'cause of your little gold digger.

14:55.173 --> 14:56.592
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

14:56.593 --> 14:58.259
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey!

14:58.260 --> 14:59.129
- Hey, hey!
- Cool it.

14:59.130 --> 15:01.734
Okay, okay, fighting is not
gonna make your kids any better.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.439
This is the second
ruckus you guys have started.

15:03.440 --> 15:05.704
If it happens again, I'm
booting you both. You understand?

15:05.705 --> 15:07.244
I'm gonna call my lawyer,
and this is gonna end.

15:07.245 --> 15:08.804
You've gone too far, Sawyer. You're done!

15:08.815 --> 15:10.763
Your money's not gonna
help you this time, dick.

15:10.764 --> 15:13.671
Okay, Mr Sawyer, I
understand why you're upset.

15:13.673 --> 15:15.366
Do you have a daughter?

15:15.400 --> 15:16.486
No.

15:16.520 --> 15:18.086
- But...
- Then you have no idea.

15:18.121 --> 15:19.718
She's all I have left.

15:22.760 --> 15:24.710
Mr Sawyer.

15:24.745 --> 15:26.918
Why don't you wait in the waiting room?

15:26.952 --> 15:28.679
- That sounded intense.
- Yeah.

15:28.712 --> 15:31.047
- Young love, Texas style.
- All right.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.656
Hey, do you have a minute to do me a favor?

15:32.680 --> 15:33.766
Yeah, sure. What's up?

15:33.800 --> 15:35.627
Well, my pregnant
patient is so stressed-out

15:35.628 --> 15:37.095
about having her baby before she's married

15:37.096 --> 15:38.406
that her BP is off the charts,

15:38.440 --> 15:40.134
which just complicated premature labor.

15:40.168 --> 15:41.574
- Yeah, that's not good.
- No.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.932
And Gwen found out that her fiancé lied

15:43.933 --> 15:45.222
about being stationed in Germany

15:45.257 --> 15:47.142
and he's really in Afghanistan.

15:47.177 --> 15:48.870
He told her that so she wouldn't worry.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.635
- Sound familiar?
- No.

15:50.636 --> 15:52.710
I mean, I was gonna tell you eventually...

15:52.744 --> 15:53.678
When I got back.

15:53.679 --> 15:55.861
And I figured out where you
were in less than a week.

15:55.862 --> 15:57.991
- Anyway... oh, thank you.
- Here's the list.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.859
Uh, we've managed to track down his unit,

15:59.860 --> 16:01.580
but we've been unable to reach him.

16:01.580 --> 16:03.227
So I was wondering if maybe you could ask

16:03.228 --> 16:04.637
one of your army buddies to help out.

16:04.638 --> 16:05.884
- Yeah.
- Hey, Tee?

16:05.885 --> 16:06.950
- Can I have a word?
- Yeah.

16:06.951 --> 16:09.511
Yeah, yeah. Coming.
Uh, yeah, I can do that.

16:09.512 --> 16:10.995
Thank you. I owe you one.

16:10.996 --> 16:12.878
Yeah. What you got, Toph?

16:15.650 --> 16:17.958
Oh, having seconds thoughts?

16:17.993 --> 16:20.198
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

16:20.232 --> 16:23.503
I just didn't know that he
was seeing someone so soon.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.720
Really? Oh, by the way, your mom called me.

16:25.721 --> 16:27.472
She wanted to know the real
reason why you guys broke up.

16:27.484 --> 16:28.903
Well, what did you tell her?

16:28.936 --> 16:30.662
The truth.

16:30.696 --> 16:32.710
Herpes.

16:32.745 --> 16:34.875
I didn't say who had it.

16:34.876 --> 16:37.242
You're a horrible friend.

16:37.243 --> 16:38.055
You know that, right?

16:38.088 --> 16:40.262
Mr Sawyer, the
sheriff called me himself,

16:40.296 --> 16:42.385
telling me to remove the cuffs immediately

16:42.386 --> 16:43.676
and... and to apologize.

16:43.677 --> 16:45.867
That deputy who did this
is being reprimanded.

16:45.868 --> 16:46.904
He was enforcing the law.

16:46.905 --> 16:48.807
He was enforcing your revenge.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.165
Apparently, in Texas,

16:50.165 --> 16:51.962
there's something called
The Romeo and Juliet Law,

16:51.963 --> 16:53.946
which allows for consensual intercourse

16:53.947 --> 16:55.456
with a minor within three years of age.

16:55.457 --> 16:56.739
It's... it's not illegal.

16:56.740 --> 16:58.279
We heard the deputy was your buddy,

16:58.280 --> 16:59.262
and that's why you did it.

16:59.263 --> 17:00.823
He did it because we served together.

17:00.824 --> 17:02.550
We'd do anything for each other.

17:02.551 --> 17:04.292
Look, I get that.

17:04.294 --> 17:06.133
With all due respect, boys...

17:06.133 --> 17:08.396
Hey, I did three tours in the sandbox.

17:08.397 --> 17:10.773
Rangers. Doctor Zia here did two.

17:10.809 --> 17:12.631
I thought you were just doctors.

17:12.665 --> 17:13.910
You sound like
my mother-in-law.

17:13.944 --> 17:15.550
Where were you?

17:15.551 --> 17:19.710
Paktika, Helmand, Gawardesh.

17:19.982 --> 17:22.827
I spent some time in
Helmand I'd like to forget.

17:22.862 --> 17:24.653
Two... two long deployments, you know.

17:24.654 --> 17:26.476
I come back the second time...

17:26.510 --> 17:28.620
my daughter is living with friends.

17:28.654 --> 17:30.220
My wife, gone.

17:30.253 --> 17:31.788
Didn't want to be a wife anymore,

17:31.821 --> 17:33.410
or a mom, or... just gone.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.860
I'm sorry. That's... that's rough.

17:35.861 --> 17:37.945
You know, sometimes, it's, uh...

17:37.946 --> 17:40.831
it's harder coming back
than it is being there.

17:40.832 --> 17:43.006
Yeah, yeah.

17:43.007 --> 17:43.906
That's true. Yeah.

17:43.907 --> 17:46.241
And... and now I work
these two crap jobs to...

17:46.243 --> 17:49.583
just to keep her in that
school so she's got a future.

17:49.589 --> 17:51.921
I'm not gonna let that punk ruin it.

17:55.378 --> 17:57.023
Why don't we get some coffee?

17:57.024 --> 17:59.483
And I'll... I'll get an update
on your daughter's scans.

17:59.484 --> 18:02.095
- We can talk it out.
- Great, right. Thanks, doc.

18:02.096 --> 18:03.240
Right.

18:04.783 --> 18:06.349
So, what's your assessment?

18:06.382 --> 18:09.325
32-year-old female
with colicky flank pain

18:09.358 --> 18:10.645
and large blood in her urinalysis,

18:10.646 --> 18:12.702
which indeed points to a kidney stone.

18:12.703 --> 18:14.412
I ordered her a CT, some IV fluids,

18:14.447 --> 18:16.567
and I was gonna give her
pain meds for the discomfort.

18:16.788 --> 18:18.605
How about a band-aid?

18:18.606 --> 18:20.997
- Band-aid?
- Your finger, please.

18:22.088 --> 18:23.431
The other finger.

18:24.622 --> 18:27.692
She pricks her finger,
puts a few drops of blood

18:27.727 --> 18:29.087
in the urine sample to make it look like

18:29.099 --> 18:30.741
a kidney stone so she can get narcotics.

18:30.742 --> 18:34.020
I cut this on a magazine. I saw you
in here last month trying to same gag,

18:34.021 --> 18:36.399
and I remember you 'cause you
were wearing a Lakers T-shirt

18:36.400 --> 18:37.813
and I hate the Lakers.

18:37.814 --> 18:39.307
Stop wasting our time. You understand me?

18:39.308 --> 18:41.393
We got real patients. Get some help.

18:41.394 --> 18:42.927
If you had checked the chart,
you would have found she's been

18:42.928 --> 18:45.085
in here a ton of times
trying to get narcotics.

18:45.086 --> 18:46.487
Things often aren't what they seem.

18:48.629 --> 18:50.774
So, my brother... and
he's a platoon leader.

18:50.775 --> 18:52.686
So he... he yells up,
"hey, hey, I got him!"

18:52.801 --> 18:54.005
I smoked... I smoked his ass!"

18:54.040 --> 18:56.595
So we run down there, right,
just making sure it's all clear.

18:56.596 --> 18:59.175
And he smoked him, all right,
except it wasn't Taliban.

18:59.290 --> 19:00.662
No? It was a cow.

19:00.696 --> 19:01.825
A cow? Yeah.

19:01.826 --> 19:04.086
It was the first steak we
had in about six months.

19:04.119 --> 19:07.242
And after that, Thad was
forever known as "Smoke."

19:07.243 --> 19:08.243
"Lord Smoke."

19:10.022 --> 19:11.340
Yeah.

19:11.455 --> 19:12.430
How's your brother doing?

19:12.431 --> 19:13.447
- Is he... is he still in?
- No, no.

19:13.471 --> 19:15.733
No. No, no. No, no. H-he was KIA.

19:17.336 --> 19:19.542
I'm sorry.

19:19.575 --> 19:22.230
Nah. It's cool.

19:22.263 --> 19:23.852
Were you over there when that happened?

19:23.853 --> 19:24.918
Yeah, yeah.

19:24.952 --> 19:27.798
I... I was about 15 feet
from him when it happened.

19:29.884 --> 19:31.797
- What are you gonna do?
- Oh, my God.

19:35.865 --> 19:38.359
Let me ask you something.

19:38.360 --> 19:40.017
How are you so together?

19:40.018 --> 19:42.345
Nah, I'm not together,
man. It's still a struggle.

19:42.346 --> 19:45.383
Ah. You got a good job, right?

19:45.384 --> 19:46.294
You got a good woman?

19:46.328 --> 19:48.155
Yeah, the best.

19:48.156 --> 19:49.497
You marry her?

19:49.498 --> 19:51.176
Almost. Almost.

19:51.177 --> 19:53.543
I-I planned on asking her
when I got back from the war,

19:53.544 --> 19:55.598
and then everything went to hell.

19:56.498 --> 19:59.414
I'd say you got it pretty well together.

19:59.667 --> 20:01.644
Me? I-I'm back two years.

20:01.645 --> 20:04.006
I... I can't seem to get ahead.

20:04.007 --> 20:05.061
Like quicksand, you know.

20:05.062 --> 20:09.065
I get myself out and, uh, you
know, I'm right back in it.

20:09.610 --> 20:12.541
Over there, I was a leader of men.

20:12.542 --> 20:17.009
- Yeah.
- I was kicking down doors, taking names.

20:17.043 --> 20:20.689
I wore the uniform proud, you know?

20:20.723 --> 20:23.243
I mean, look at the uniform I wear now.

20:23.244 --> 20:24.828
I'm a joke.

20:24.829 --> 20:25.829
No.

20:26.271 --> 20:29.309
It took me a few years to get where I'm at.

20:30.647 --> 20:31.861
I was a mess.

20:31.895 --> 20:33.141
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:33.175 --> 20:35.221
And the only thing that turned it around

20:35.255 --> 20:37.301
was... was me asking for help.

20:39.191 --> 20:41.904
Well... Who am I gonna ask, you know?

20:41.905 --> 20:45.589
I mean, Taylor, I can't talk
to her. She's just a kid.

20:46.838 --> 20:48.469
There's a lot of programs that can help.

20:48.503 --> 20:50.293
You got to turn it around, man.

20:50.326 --> 20:53.493
Otherwise, you're gonna
drown in anger and self-pity.

20:54.083 --> 20:55.937
I've been there.

20:57.591 --> 21:01.077
You got to drop the pride BS.

21:01.111 --> 21:05.684
There's a lot of people
who are willing to help you.

21:05.719 --> 21:07.509
But <i>you</i> got to ask for it.

21:09.143 --> 21:13.909
And then, I-if they offer
it, you got to take it.

21:15.894 --> 21:17.460
I'm offering.

21:17.495 --> 21:19.317
So just... just take it.

21:21.239 --> 21:22.964
Okay.

21:22.999 --> 21:24.180
- Okay.
- Thanks.

21:24.215 --> 21:27.477
Do it for the cow.

21:29.399 --> 21:30.644
This is not gonna hurt.

21:30.679 --> 21:32.094
We're just checking your heart, okay?

21:32.118 --> 21:34.484
- Okay. Have you heard anything?
- About Ryan?

21:34.519 --> 21:37.933
Yeah, he's resting comfortably.
He's no longer under arrest.

21:37.934 --> 21:39.733
And, yes, he's been asking about you.

21:39.767 --> 21:42.290
- How is she?
- Head CT looked good.

21:42.291 --> 21:43.643
Her others scans are coming up shortly.

21:43.644 --> 21:44.948
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

21:44.983 --> 21:46.562
I don't want to talk to you.

21:46.563 --> 21:48.605
Taylor, I love you. I'm
trying to protect you.

21:48.606 --> 21:50.164
So you got Ryan arrested?

21:50.165 --> 21:51.129
We're nothing to them, sweetie.

21:51.130 --> 21:52.702
You never even tried to get to know him,

21:52.726 --> 21:54.798
- or how he makes me feel.
- I'm just doing what's best for you.

21:54.799 --> 21:56.056
I... you know, I hate you.

21:56.057 --> 21:57.172
I hate you.

21:57.207 --> 21:59.017
- Don't say that.
- I hate you!

21:59.018 --> 21:59.605
Don't say that!

21:59.639 --> 22:01.034
Heart rate's going up.

22:01.035 --> 22:02.041
She needs to rest.

22:02.042 --> 22:03.792
- My chest!
- Taylor, what's wrong?

22:04.506 --> 22:05.694
What's going on? I heard an alarm.

22:05.718 --> 22:07.120
It looks like a heart attack.

22:07.121 --> 22:09.446
- Heart attack?! She's 16 years old! Do...
- All right, all right.

22:09.447 --> 22:11.183
Okay, it's not an
infarction. It's a dissection.

22:11.184 --> 22:12.202
Her aorta's tearing in half.

22:12.202 --> 22:14.114
Call Scott. Tell him to
meet us in the OR now.

22:14.115 --> 22:15.464
What's happening? Where are you taking her?

22:15.465 --> 22:17.190
Sir, we're going to the
OR I need you to stay here.

22:17.191 --> 22:19.706
- Taylor! Taylor!
- I will check back in with you!

22:33.955 --> 22:35.714
<i>Doctor Clegg to Trauma One.</i>

22:35.749 --> 22:38.031
<i>Doctor Clegg to Trauma One.</i>
She coded in the elevator.

22:38.032 --> 22:40.130
16-year-old with aortic
dissection from an MVA.

22:40.136 --> 22:42.221
16? Her parent's here? Her
father and husband. Long story.

22:42.222 --> 22:44.764
All right, tell the OR we're
going on bypass immediately.

22:45.352 --> 22:47.503
* <i>Come on and make a move</i> *

22:47.515 --> 22:50.773
* <i>there's another world</i>
<i>outside your door</i> *

22:50.774 --> 22:52.844
You got stuck with Marilyn Capshaw, huh?

22:52.845 --> 22:54.079
Yeah, yeah.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.661
Here with altered mental status,

22:55.696 --> 22:56.910
disorganized thinking and attention.

22:56.911 --> 22:58.990
I'm thinking acute delirium,

22:58.991 --> 23:01.519
- maybe encephalopathy.
- CT?

23:01.520 --> 23:03.931
Normal, as was her EEG, CMP,

23:03.932 --> 23:06.149
CBC, and all her other labs.

23:06.150 --> 23:08.152
Her, uh... her son has
called over five times

23:08.153 --> 23:09.566
and left messages about her diagnosis.

23:09.566 --> 23:11.106
I just... I wanted to
run the case by you first.

23:11.107 --> 23:12.078
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:12.112 --> 23:15.995
Mrs Capshaw? Hello. I'm Doctor Zia.

23:15.996 --> 23:17.596
We've met a couple of times before.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.099
Do you have change for a $20?

23:19.100 --> 23:20.622
I need more chips.

23:20.623 --> 23:22.606
I-I don't have any cash on me.

23:22.607 --> 23:26.814
Do you mind if I take a
look at your pretty eyes?

23:26.842 --> 23:29.372
Well, sure, you sweet thing.

23:29.383 --> 23:30.647
All right.

23:30.648 --> 23:33.656
Yes. Uh-huh.

23:33.657 --> 23:35.214
Pretty as ever.

23:35.215 --> 23:36.305
Thank you, love.

23:37.223 --> 23:38.685
Did you do a tox screen?

23:39.009 --> 23:40.830
Um, no.

23:40.831 --> 23:42.520
She's, uh... she's 82.

23:42.521 --> 23:44.403
She's 82 and high as a kite.

23:44.404 --> 23:45.272
Wait, what?

23:45.273 --> 23:47.111
Baked, blazed, stoned out of her gourd,

23:47.112 --> 23:48.293
whatever euphemism you want.

23:48.294 --> 23:50.062
Trust me. Send the test.

23:50.096 --> 23:53.188
* <i>So, you can fall down</i>
<i>or you can bounce up</i> *

23:53.189 --> 23:54.591
- Want some chips?
- Mm.

23:58.845 --> 24:00.199
So, how's checking vitals going?

24:00.317 --> 24:02.972
Uh, it was going fine, but I
can't feel this guy's pulse.

24:03.005 --> 24:04.523
What do you mean?

24:04.524 --> 24:05.875
You're checking for it in the wrong spot.

24:05.876 --> 24:08.077
No, I-I-I know how to
check a radial pulse, okay.

24:08.078 --> 24:10.091
Th-there isn't one. I
can't feel a femoral.

24:10.091 --> 24:12.272
Son of a bitch. What did you do?

24:12.273 --> 24:14.209
What did you do?! I
stepped out for one minute!

24:14.210 --> 24:17.884
Not... n-nothing! I-I-I was
practicing vitals like you said.

24:18.918 --> 24:19.840
Get the crash cart.

24:19.841 --> 24:21.355
- Yes, Doctor.
- Wait, wait wait! Wait, wait!

24:21.356 --> 24:22.548
- You're gonna shock him?!
- Yes.

24:22.549 --> 24:24.187
- Damn it, he's got dogjaw.
- What?

24:24.221 --> 24:25.934
- Dogjaw! Check his carotid and see
- Oh, my God.

24:25.935 --> 24:27.451
If you can find a pulse.

24:35.903 --> 24:38.107
Mr Howard has a ventricular assist device.

24:38.141 --> 24:40.105
Comes in a couple times
a year to get it checked.

24:40.106 --> 24:43.004
His blood flows continuously
rather than by pump,

24:43.037 --> 24:44.060
so no pulse.

24:44.093 --> 24:45.093
Freaky, huh?

24:46.205 --> 24:48.162
Ah, pranking that
someone's in cardiac arrest.

24:48.163 --> 24:50.404
- Yeah, that's... that's hilarious.
- Welcome to the night shift.

24:50.405 --> 24:51.771
And what did I tell you last time?

24:51.805 --> 24:54.484
Check the chart. It's all right there.

24:54.981 --> 24:58.139
You're a great teacher, Drew.
Thanks for all your help.

25:02.685 --> 25:05.682
The good news is we
stopped your contractions.

25:05.952 --> 25:08.603
But you have an early placental abruption.

25:08.637 --> 25:10.309
- So when the OB is done with his other
- Oh, God.

25:10.310 --> 25:12.484
Delivery, you're going
to need a c-section.

25:12.485 --> 25:14.217
Can... I need to call my
fiancé. Have you found him?

25:14.218 --> 25:16.620
- I need to talk to him.
- Yes... technically, yes.

25:17.213 --> 25:19.107
We just need to get our
hands on him physically.

25:19.108 --> 25:21.500
Look, stress is not good for
the baby or the abruption.

25:21.533 --> 25:23.164
Okay?

25:23.197 --> 25:25.948
Remember, deep breathes.

25:25.981 --> 25:27.527
Just please find him.

25:27.528 --> 25:29.307
- How's Ragosa doing?
- Pouting.

25:29.341 --> 25:31.273
Still thinks he's a VP and not the PA.

25:31.274 --> 25:32.970
Well, Rome wasn't built in a day.

25:33.192 --> 25:35.828
I still don't understand how
you can give him this job.

25:35.829 --> 25:37.477
He was such a dick to
you and the rest of us.

25:37.501 --> 25:40.667
Yeah, he was. You remember
when you first came out?

25:40.702 --> 25:41.667
Wait, I'm gay?

25:41.668 --> 25:44.017
- Doctor Alister.
- One of the board members

25:44.023 --> 25:46.377
wanted to fire you, which, as
you know, they can in Texas.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.707
Guess who called him a bigot

25:47.708 --> 25:49.998
and said he'd fight him
tooth and nail on that?

25:50.963 --> 25:52.232
Ragosa?

25:52.239 --> 25:53.051
Mm.

25:53.086 --> 25:55.131
"Check out the big brain on Brad."

25:56.268 --> 25:57.051
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:57.085 --> 25:58.171
How's the girl?

25:58.205 --> 25:59.388
Scott's got his hands full.

25:59.421 --> 26:01.787
I-I came out to talk to her
dad, but I couldn't find him.

26:01.822 --> 26:03.907
- Hmm.
- I wanted to tell you my buddy tracked

26:03.908 --> 26:07.228
down the fiancé. He's
in Afghanistan in Bagram.

26:07.261 --> 26:09.050
- Oh, good. And he's still...
- Totally into her.

26:09.051 --> 26:10.449
Just freaked out about her and the baby.

26:10.450 --> 26:13.211
Yeah, well, it doesn't look like
this baby's gonna wait for a wedding.

26:20.926 --> 26:22.811
What are you... what are you doing in here?

26:22.846 --> 26:24.207
Getting some privacy.

26:24.208 --> 26:25.563
Well, your lab results came back.

26:25.564 --> 26:27.707
They show very high levels of marijuana.

26:27.742 --> 26:29.083
Could have told you that.

26:29.117 --> 26:30.939
S-so why didn't you?

26:30.974 --> 26:32.933
You made me look like an
idiot in front of my boss.

26:32.957 --> 26:34.204
You did that to yourself.

26:34.237 --> 26:36.094
You saw an old lady

26:36.095 --> 26:38.523
and never thought of the possibility,

26:38.558 --> 26:41.884
though I was exhibiting
all of the behavior.

26:42.573 --> 26:45.243
Look, I-I-I need
to tell your son.

26:45.278 --> 26:47.624
He's been all over me
about what's wrong with you.

26:47.625 --> 26:49.760
There's nothing wrong with me.

26:49.761 --> 26:51.379
A little advice, Paul.

26:51.380 --> 26:54.455
Don't try to so hard to please everybody.

26:55.979 --> 27:00.106
You know, you'll only end up with regrets.

27:07.046 --> 27:09.300
W... hey, hey, you... you can't do that.

27:09.301 --> 27:10.211
Not here.

27:10.212 --> 27:11.978
Why do you think I wanted privacy?

27:11.979 --> 27:14.897
Besides, you gonna stop me?

27:19.111 --> 27:20.237
You want a hit?

27:20.238 --> 27:22.108
N-no, thank you.

27:22.109 --> 27:23.259
Go ahead.

27:23.293 --> 27:25.755
Your father would be very disappointed.

27:25.789 --> 27:28.475
- Wait, what? How do... how do you...
- Know your father?

27:28.509 --> 27:29.659
What do you think?

27:29.693 --> 27:34.203
Called me last year about your internship.

27:34.973 --> 27:36.763
He... he got me in here?

27:36.797 --> 27:40.829
Actually, he wanted us to keep you out.

27:47.975 --> 27:50.286
You know, h-he still
calls me once a month,

27:50.287 --> 27:52.350
trying to get me to quit ER.

27:52.351 --> 27:53.891
He says one day I can join

27:53.892 --> 27:55.684
him and my brother's practice in Chicago.

27:55.685 --> 27:57.331
And why don't you?

27:57.812 --> 27:59.761
'Cause I don't want to follow anybody.

27:59.762 --> 28:01.233
The real reason.

28:06.787 --> 28:11.151
Uh, what if... what if
I'm... I'm not good enough?

28:11.581 --> 28:15.210
Maybe... maybe I'm Peyton Manning, right?

28:15.211 --> 28:18.656
But maybe I'm Jeffrey Jordan.

28:18.657 --> 28:19.958
Th-those are the sons of...

28:19.964 --> 28:21.168
I know who they are.

28:21.169 --> 28:22.351
Okay.

28:22.514 --> 28:24.184
Now, look, I know I'm buzzed,

28:24.185 --> 28:27.919
but I'm gonna give you
one last piece of advice.

28:27.920 --> 28:33.368
Now, even though I was the
black sheep of the family,

28:33.369 --> 28:35.357
I still never followed my heart.

28:35.358 --> 28:38.993
I did what they wanted me to.

28:39.835 --> 28:44.619
So you figure out what you want to do.

28:44.620 --> 28:48.537
Not from fear, but for the right reasons.

28:50.918 --> 28:54.304
And they can go to hell
if they get in your way.

28:59.447 --> 29:00.853
Thank you.

29:00.863 --> 29:03.869
I will.

29:04.347 --> 29:09.556
Now... Here's what we're gonna tell my son.

29:09.557 --> 29:11.353
Hey, you paged me?

29:11.354 --> 29:12.444
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

29:12.445 --> 29:14.171
I'm not falling for this
crap again, okay, Drew?

29:14.172 --> 29:16.084
This is real. You want to learn something?

29:16.085 --> 29:18.577
Grab that crash cart. This is Mr Simpson.

29:18.578 --> 29:21.321
He came in with a heart
attack, went into v-fib arrest.

29:21.322 --> 29:23.289
Now, hit "power." Set the voltage to 360.

29:23.324 --> 29:25.081
Press "charge."

29:25.115 --> 29:26.681
Okay.

29:26.716 --> 29:28.921
This is all you.

29:28.955 --> 29:30.195
B-but I've never done this before.

29:30.196 --> 29:32.362
Then it's gonna be a hell of
a good time to learn, isn't it?

29:32.363 --> 29:34.226
Set the paddles at 10:00 and 5:00.

29:34.227 --> 29:36.510
Okay. Okay, like this?

29:36.520 --> 29:37.958
Yeah, everybody clear.

29:37.992 --> 29:39.046
Go.

29:41.352 --> 29:42.310
Still v-fib.

29:42.344 --> 29:43.430
What are you gonna do?

29:43.463 --> 29:45.702
Okay, uh, charging again.

29:46.984 --> 29:48.422
Clear.

29:50.535 --> 29:52.934
Oh, man, that's sinus.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.062
- I can feel a pulse.
- Yes, it is.

29:57.096 --> 29:59.781
Hang an amiodarone drip.
Get him to the cath lab.

29:59.816 --> 30:01.990
Okay, right away.

30:02.024 --> 30:03.507
Oh, holy cow.

30:03.508 --> 30:04.820
- That man was...
- dead.

30:04.821 --> 30:06.696
And now he isn't.

30:06.697 --> 30:10.598
Congratulations. You just saved his life.

30:10.632 --> 30:13.126
Thanks.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.886
It turns out she just had low blood sugar.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.141
I-I gave her IV dextrose.

30:16.142 --> 30:17.783
And here's a list of dietary adjustments.

30:18.389 --> 30:19.917
That's all? I mean, she was...

30:19.918 --> 30:21.478
Get the car.

30:21.506 --> 30:23.255
- Doctor Zia?
- Yes, Ma'am?

30:23.256 --> 30:25.772
Are you aware of what a remarkable

30:25.773 --> 30:27.315
young doctor you have here?

30:27.316 --> 30:30.790
I expect him to be made
an attending physician

30:30.824 --> 30:33.350
at this institution one day very soon

30:33.383 --> 30:36.454
in whatever specialty he pursues.

30:46.632 --> 30:48.486
How did you pull that off?

30:48.520 --> 30:52.486
Uh, it must be my wonderful
bedside manner, I-I guess.

30:55.719 --> 30:57.766
I love you, baby.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.326
<i>You look so beautiful.</i>

31:00.360 --> 31:02.246
Hey. You paged me?

31:02.280 --> 31:04.486
Uh, yeah. We're all set here.

31:04.520 --> 31:07.206
We just need an in-person
proxy groom to read the vows.

31:07.239 --> 31:08.646
You game?

31:08.680 --> 31:10.918
Sure. Why not? I got a few minutes.

31:10.952 --> 31:11.952
- Good man.
- Thank you.

31:11.976 --> 31:14.888
Of course. Tom, I'm Doctor Callahan.

31:14.889 --> 31:16.586
It is an honor to stand
in for you, Sergeant.

31:16.610 --> 31:18.532
<i>The honor's mine. I
can't thank you enough</i>

31:18.539 --> 31:20.047
<i>for making this wedding
happen, Doctors.</i>

31:20.071 --> 31:21.754
Can't get married without a bouquet.

31:21.767 --> 31:23.205
Why, thank you.

31:24.296 --> 31:25.446
Are you ready?

31:25.479 --> 31:27.526
Yes, I'm ready.

31:27.560 --> 31:29.126
Dearly beloved,

31:29.160 --> 31:31.357
we are gathered together
here in the sight of God

31:31.358 --> 31:33.677
to join together in holy matrimony...

31:33.678 --> 31:35.024
Chloe and Tom.

31:35.048 --> 31:36.196
Baby's having accelerations.

31:36.197 --> 31:37.791
- I'm feeling short of breath.
- All right, that's it.

31:37.792 --> 31:38.564
We're getting her to the OR.

31:38.570 --> 31:40.815
- <i>What's happening? Chloe?</i>
- Sorry, Daddy. Baby, I'm sorry.

31:40.839 --> 31:42.799
This ain't over yet,
sweetie. Okay, somebody

31:42.800 --> 31:44.106
- tell the OB we're on our way.
- <i>Okay, what is...</i>

31:44.107 --> 31:45.508
- <i>w-where are you taking her?</i>
- Reverend, skip to the good stuff

31:45.509 --> 31:46.622
- and try to keep up.
- <i>Somebody talk to me.</i>

31:46.623 --> 31:47.950
I've never done anything like this.

31:47.951 --> 31:49.820
Move it along, Padre.
You got about 15 seconds.

31:49.821 --> 31:51.031
- <i>Chloe, are you okay?</i>
- Do you take this woman to be your

31:51.044 --> 31:52.045
- wedded wife?
- I do.

31:52.046 --> 31:53.380
Do you take this man to
be your wedded husband?

31:53.381 --> 31:54.288
- I do.
- <i>Chloe?</i>

31:54.289 --> 31:55.655
- She does.
- Then I pronounce you man and wife.

31:55.656 --> 31:56.902
BP's down to 40 systolic.

31:56.936 --> 31:57.991
<i>Chloe, I love you.</i>

31:58.293 --> 32:00.179
- Jordan!
- She's hemorrhaging!

32:00.180 --> 32:02.085
We can't get her to the OR
we got to do it down here.

32:02.086 --> 32:03.710
Trauma One. Let's go.

32:05.916 --> 32:07.785
The baby's heart rate is still down.

32:08.205 --> 32:10.160
Opening the peritoneum.

32:11.109 --> 32:13.583
Two units of blood are in.

32:14.108 --> 32:15.866
Well, this is a hell of a honeymoon.

32:15.867 --> 32:17.394
Any word from OB? Scalpel.

32:17.395 --> 32:19.666
She has her hands full with
a uterine rupture upstairs.

32:19.667 --> 32:20.592
Glad we got started.

32:20.625 --> 32:22.383
Incising the uterus.

32:22.423 --> 32:25.240
Hey, setting up the Skype
with the father in 15 minutes.

32:25.241 --> 32:26.073
Anything I can tell him?

32:26.074 --> 32:27.823
Yeah, I'll have the story
for him in about five seconds.

32:27.824 --> 32:29.711
- You want to watch?
- Yeah.

32:30.279 --> 32:31.748
There we go.

32:32.465 --> 32:34.032
Here she comes.

32:36.740 --> 32:38.511
All right.

32:38.545 --> 32:40.552
You tell them, sweetie.

32:43.006 --> 32:44.924
Cutting the cord.

32:46.737 --> 32:50.632
My... my... how's my baby girl?

32:50.633 --> 32:54.444
She's beautiful, just like
her mother and her doctor.

32:54.445 --> 32:55.889
I think he was talking about himself.

32:55.890 --> 32:57.200
Yeah, I'm sure he was.

32:58.547 --> 33:00.802
Sorry, I just love babies.

33:00.803 --> 33:03.120
And weddings.

33:04.518 --> 33:06.085
Thank you for everything.

33:06.514 --> 33:08.176
You have no idea what this means to me.

33:08.210 --> 33:09.680
Who's my baby girl?

33:09.715 --> 33:12.224
Hey, Tee. Hey, Scott needs to talk to you.

33:12.225 --> 33:13.744
It's okay. We'll close up.

33:19.890 --> 33:25.008
* I've gone on too long *

33:27.251 --> 33:29.169
- * carrying the *
- Is she dead?

33:29.170 --> 33:34.023
- * weight of this heart of stone *
- No. But she's comatose.

33:34.024 --> 33:36.432
Her brain was deprived
of oxygen for too long.

33:36.466 --> 33:37.737
We've done everything we could possibly do.

33:37.738 --> 33:40.560
Oh,
my baby! My little girl!

33:40.594 --> 33:43.600
It's her birthday.

33:43.634 --> 33:46.480
* Just let me go *

33:46.514 --> 33:48.465
I'm sorry.

33:48.498 --> 33:50.896
There's still a possibility
she could come out of this.

33:50.930 --> 33:53.712
We have to run a few tests
on her brain function.

33:53.746 --> 33:56.145
No, no, just leave her.
Leave her. Leave us alone.

33:56.178 --> 33:58.384
Okay.

33:58.834 --> 34:06.800
* After all the things
that I've done wrong *

34:06.834 --> 34:09.040
* I don't belong *

34:10.578 --> 34:12.208
What's wrong with her?

34:13.714 --> 34:15.760
"What's wrong with her"?

34:15.793 --> 34:17.616
"What's wrong with her"?

34:17.650 --> 34:20.304
You did this to her!

34:22.424 --> 34:24.431
You did this to her.

34:26.570 --> 34:28.250
- Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- No, no, no, no, no.

34:28.274 --> 34:30.420
Hey. Hey, whoa, Denny.

34:30.420 --> 34:32.027
- What are you doing?
- He killed her.

34:32.027 --> 34:34.034
No, no. She's not dead.

34:34.034 --> 34:36.529
She's brain-dead. It's the same thing.

34:36.530 --> 34:39.216
It's not. Hey! It's not, and she isn't.

34:39.251 --> 34:40.944
She still has brain activity.

34:40.978 --> 34:42.063
There's still hope.

34:42.098 --> 34:43.380
I got no hope. Get out of the way.

34:43.380 --> 34:45.447
That's not true, okay?
We're gonna help you.

34:45.449 --> 34:47.152
Doc, you've been good to me.

34:47.186 --> 34:48.570
I don't want to shoot you, but I will.

34:48.594 --> 34:49.685
I don't want you to shoot me, either.

34:49.686 --> 34:51.208
But I'm not gonna let you hurt that boy.

34:51.208 --> 34:52.719
- Get out of the way.
- No.

34:52.754 --> 34:53.904
Get out of the way!

34:53.938 --> 34:55.813
You give me that gun.

34:56.658 --> 34:58.224
We can figure this out.

34:58.258 --> 34:59.696
Just you and me.

35:00.262 --> 35:04.100
Come on. Give me the gun.

35:05.458 --> 35:06.960
We can figure this out.

35:09.466 --> 35:11.312
There's nothing to figure out.

35:11.346 --> 35:12.912
Come on. It's you and me.

35:16.114 --> 35:21.392
* Save my soul *

35:39.154 --> 35:43.344
- * Who will save my soul? *
- This is the 10th unit of blood.

35:43.378 --> 35:44.784
He's gone five rounds of epi.

35:44.818 --> 35:47.038
Cross clamped for 20 minutes already.

35:47.039 --> 35:49.616
- * After all the things *
- But I'll keep going if you want.

35:49.650 --> 35:53.648
* that I've done wrong *

35:55.218 --> 35:58.764
* who will save my soul? *

35:58.765 --> 36:00.624
No.

36:00.867 --> 36:02.719
Let's call it.

36:05.551 --> 36:08.439
Time of death is 6:13.

36:14.258 --> 36:16.350
Just too much damage to his heart.

36:16.351 --> 36:19.280
Yeah, and everything else.

36:36.625 --> 36:38.032
Such a damn waste.

36:38.066 --> 36:40.944
What the hell are we supposed to do now?

36:43.090 --> 36:45.776
You hug your son...

36:45.810 --> 36:50.608
- * on the other side, I hope all is calm *
- Every chance you get.

36:53.170 --> 36:57.488
* on the other side,
I hope all is bright *

36:59.922 --> 37:06.768
* oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh *

37:06.802 --> 37:14.608
* oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh *

37:14.642 --> 37:19.280
* on the other side, I hope I am able *

37:21.426 --> 37:24.913
* on the other side,
I hope I am strong *

37:27.835 --> 37:32.052
* oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh *

37:35.506 --> 37:38.040
- * oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh *
- <i>Hey, man, come over and</i>

37:38.040 --> 37:38.771
<i>check out my baby.</i>

37:38.772 --> 37:40.592
Shh, shh-shh-shh-shh.

37:40.626 --> 37:43.184
<i>God, look at you.</i>

37:43.217 --> 37:47.376
<i>Chloe, you're beautiful.
The baby's beautiful.</i>

37:49.233 --> 37:51.472
<i>I got a baby girl!</i>

37:52.771 --> 37:56.679
<i>I love you, baby.
I miss you so much.</i>

37:56.680 --> 37:58.490
<i>Wish I could be there with you.</i>

38:08.978 --> 38:10.864
Poor guy.

38:10.898 --> 38:12.623
Just couldn't find his way back.

38:12.658 --> 38:15.024
Yeah, it happens.

38:15.058 --> 38:17.104
He didn't have what I had here...

38:17.138 --> 38:19.024
you and Jordan.

38:20.657 --> 38:22.352
I would have never made it without you.

38:22.386 --> 38:26.512
Yeah, well... Had to.

38:26.546 --> 38:29.040
Too much of a pain to
train a new best friend.

38:30.994 --> 38:32.400
Yeah.

38:32.433 --> 38:37.168
* On the other side,
I hope I am strong *

38:38.897 --> 38:45.360
* oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh *

38:45.883 --> 38:52.400
* oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh *

38:52.434 --> 38:56.944
* 'cause I know, 'cause I know *

38:56.978 --> 38:59.086
We're trying to contact Taylor's mom,

38:59.087 --> 39:00.543
see if she wants to step in again.

39:00.544 --> 39:02.895
- That's a hell of a bridge to repair.
- Yeah.

39:02.930 --> 39:04.656
No other family to speak of?

39:04.690 --> 39:06.188
No.

39:06.189 --> 39:09.136
Just all of us and Ryan's family.

39:09.169 --> 39:12.080
We, uh, got her lined up
in a good care facility.

39:12.114 --> 39:14.319
She actually may recover.

39:14.354 --> 39:16.080
It's unbelievable.

39:16.114 --> 39:18.960
I mean, just when you think
you've seen everything,

39:18.994 --> 39:21.115
her waking up has got
to go down as a miracle.

39:21.121 --> 39:22.640
Yeah.

39:22.674 --> 39:24.160
If only we could have had another one.

39:24.161 --> 39:26.160
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

39:26.193 --> 39:29.360
Anyway, why don't we go back to my place?

39:29.394 --> 39:30.960
I'll make you a nice breakfast,

39:30.993 --> 39:33.424
and we can think about how lucky we are.

39:33.458 --> 39:38.640
Actually, let's go to my place.

39:38.673 --> 39:41.712
I think it's time that I
told my mother about us.

39:43.154 --> 39:45.072
Are you sure now is the right time?

39:45.106 --> 39:47.600
I've never been so sure in my life.

39:48.003 --> 39:50.640
* oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh *

39:50.674 --> 39:52.592
Let's go home.
