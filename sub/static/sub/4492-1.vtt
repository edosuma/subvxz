03:04.240 --> 03:10.360
Young man, do you have the time?
l got six clocks, and none of them work.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.480
- Twenty after nine.
- After?

03:13.600 --> 03:16.840
lt's twenty after, dear. Darlin'?

03:17.040 --> 03:21.760
- Five minutes. What about you?
- l'm all set. l just ironed my sling.

03:21.880 --> 03:26.560
- The lawyer said 9.30 sharp, darlin'.
- OK.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.960
l hope you're not the miserly kind.
lt's brand-new.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.960
She ought to get a very good price for it.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.680
ls that the right mileage? 23 miles?

03:36.800 --> 03:39.960
We only took two rides in it.
lt's the darn men.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.760
They run into her
just to start a conversation.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.440
- Will you come up, lz?
- Sure, dear.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.920
Don't go by appearances. lt's brand-new.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.720
lt was a divorce present
from her husband.

03:50.840 --> 03:53.560
- They givin' presents for divorces now?
- Why not?

03:53.680 --> 03:57.120
On the anniversary of our divorce,
my husband always sends me...

03:57.240 --> 04:01.720
..one potted yellow rose,
and it'll be 19 years in July.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.200
Course, he never did pay me the alimony.

04:05.320 --> 04:09.400
But l wouldn't wanna put a man out,
you know, if his heart's not in it.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.880
You break your arm in the car?

04:12.000 --> 04:18.160
No. My last roomer, the one before Mrs
Taber, we celebrated her divorce and...

04:19.160 --> 04:21.720
..l misbehaved.

04:21.839 --> 04:24.800
l'm so sick and tired of myself.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.600
(reciting in a whisper)

04:41.560 --> 04:43.880
- Will you go over my answers again?
- Sure, dear.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.880
But don't worry, you'll do wonderfully.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.800
Let's see. ''Did your husband,
Mr Raymond Taber,...

04:50.920 --> 04:53.280
..act toward you with cruelty?''

04:53.960 --> 04:56.040
Darlin'?

04:56.160 --> 04:58.840
- Well, yes.
- Just say yes.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.400
Yes.

05:00.520 --> 05:04.200
''ln what way did this cruelty
manifest itself?''

05:08.240 --> 05:12.520
He persistently... How does that go again?

05:13.120 --> 05:17.080
''He persistently and cruelly ignored
my personal wishes and my rights,...

05:17.200 --> 05:21.880
..and resorted on several occasions
to physical violence against me.''

05:22.000 --> 05:24.320
He persistently...

05:26.120 --> 05:28.680
Oh, do l have to say that?

05:29.160 --> 05:36.400
Why can't l just say he wasn't there? He...
You could touch him, but he wasn't there.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.760
lf that was grounds for divorce,...

05:38.880 --> 05:43.760
..there'd only be about 1 1 marriages
left in the US. Now just repeat after me.

05:43.880 --> 05:47.640
- ''He persistently...
- He persistently...

05:47.760 --> 05:49.720
(car horn)

05:50.400 --> 05:52.560
They'll call in their estimate, ma'am.

05:52.680 --> 05:55.640
Those dents aren't my fault, you know.

05:56.280 --> 05:59.640
l'll recommend
the best price l can, ma'am.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.520
You can drive her now.
l've put in a new battery.

06:02.640 --> 06:05.640
l'll never drive that car again.
Let's take a taxi.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.840
l... l'll give you a lift
if you're leaving right away.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.920
Swell. Two minutes.

06:11.040 --> 06:13.880
lz, get dressed! You gotta be my witness.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.600
This'll be my 77th time
l've witnessed for a divorce.

06:18.720 --> 06:21.240
Two sevens - that's lucky, darlin'!

06:22.320 --> 06:24.640
Oh, lz, l hope.

06:37.280 --> 06:40.000
- Easy does it, now.
- Oh, you're a dear.

06:40.120 --> 06:43.120
- Here we are.
- Thanks a lot. We've gotta go now.

06:43.240 --> 06:47.480
lf you're not goin' back East right away,
l'd be glad to show you the county.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.400
Beautiful country around here, you know.

06:50.520 --> 06:53.640
Well, l don't know where l'll be, but OK.
Thanks again.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.400
My name is lsabelle Steers.

06:56.520 --> 06:59.440
lsabelle. Well, OK, you come along too.

06:59.960 --> 07:03.960
That's a sweet afterthought!
You Reno men!

07:07.800 --> 07:10.080
l can't memorise this.
lt's not the way it was.

07:10.200 --> 07:14.920
Just say it. lt doesn't have to be true.
This isn't a quiz show, it's only a court.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.000
- l just got off the plane...
- l don't wanna hear anything.

07:26.120 --> 07:29.000
Just give me five minutes.
After two years, five minutes...

07:29.120 --> 07:31.480
You can't have me now,
so you want me, that's all.

07:31.600 --> 07:37.240
Please, l'm not blaming you. lt's... l just
don't believe in the whole thing any more.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.840
Kid, l understand. l understand...

07:39.960 --> 07:43.080
You don't understand.
You're not there, Raymond.

07:43.200 --> 07:46.000
lf l'm gonna be alone,
l wanna be by myself.

07:46.120 --> 07:50.440
Go back. You're not gonna make me
feel sorry for you any more.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.640
Gay!

08:05.760 --> 08:08.440
Wait up! l was just goin' over to see ya!

08:08.560 --> 08:13.640
Well, good luck now, Susan.
l won't forget you, you can be sure of that.

08:14.480 --> 08:18.560
- l don't even know where to write you.
- General delivery. l'll get it.

08:18.680 --> 08:22.280
Will you think about it? lt's the
second-largest laundry in St Louis.

08:22.400 --> 08:25.320
l wouldn't wanna kid you.
l ain't cut out for business.

08:25.440 --> 08:28.280
Well, will you think of me? Oh, Gay...

08:28.400 --> 08:31.800
Oh, you know l will, honey. Goodbye.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.600
Bye.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.760
How're you doin', boy?
Ready to cut out of this town? Cos l am.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.440
Well, l've been thinkin' about it.

08:54.560 --> 08:58.720
- Which one was that?
- Susan. Swell sport, that woman.

08:59.560 --> 09:04.600
l just met me a girl sweet enough to eat,
Gay. Fine-lookin' woman.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.640
But when l think of all the useless talkin'
you gotta do, l get discouraged.

09:08.760 --> 09:13.000
l tell you, l'm dyin' for some fresh air.
And no people, male or female.

09:13.120 --> 09:17.360
Why don't we take out to the mountains?
We could even do a little mustangin'.

09:17.480 --> 09:20.000
l wanted to pile up about 500 this time.

09:20.120 --> 09:22.960
- l need a new engine.
- That engine'll fly you anywhere.

09:23.080 --> 09:26.120
Say, you've been two months on this job.
You'll get the habit.

09:26.240 --> 09:30.120
l'll see you over at Harrah's later.
Let's talk about it.

09:32.720 --> 09:35.160
Tom Dooley.

09:51.800 --> 09:55.920
lf you throw in your ring
you'll never get another divorce.

09:56.040 --> 09:58.160
Go ahead, honey. Everybody does it.

09:58.280 --> 10:02.360
More gold in that river
than there is in the Klondike.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.840
- Did you do that?
- Who, me? No.

10:10.960 --> 10:13.760
l lost my ring on my honeymoon.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.960
- Let's get a drink.
- That's my girl.

10:23.920 --> 10:27.840
Wait a minute, honey.
This machine loves me.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.960
Never say die.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Scotch, l guess, on i... Yeah, on ice.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.960
- Rye and water.
- Scotch on ice, rye and water.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.160
Well, cheer up.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.920
l will. l just hate to fight with anybody.

11:05.040 --> 11:08.200
When you win, you lose.
You know, in your heart.

11:08.320 --> 11:12.720
Well, you're free. Maybe the trouble is
you're not used to it yet.

11:12.840 --> 11:16.680
No, the trouble is l always
end up back where l started.

11:16.800 --> 11:20.160
Never had anybody much. And here l am.

11:20.920 --> 11:24.000
Well, you had your mother, didn't you?

11:25.840 --> 11:29.920
How do you have somebody
who disappears all the time?

11:30.040 --> 11:35.240
They both weren't there. She'd go off
with a patient for three months and...

11:35.880 --> 11:39.000
You know how long
three months is to a kid.

11:40.080 --> 11:43.400
Listen, don't leave. Settle here.

11:44.640 --> 11:48.200
They got a school.
You could teach dancing.

11:48.320 --> 11:53.200
One thing about this town,
it's always full of interesting strangers.

11:55.720 --> 11:58.440
Oh, l'm sorry. What did l say? l...

12:00.560 --> 12:04.960
l suddenly miss my mother.
Oh, isn't that the stupidest thing?

12:08.800 --> 12:13.800
lz, you're a fine woman. Practically the
only woman that's ever been my friend.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.120
Well, drink up then.

12:19.040 --> 12:23.480
Oh, isn't that the dearest dog?
Look how sweet he sits there.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.480
Yeah. Dogs are nice.

12:26.600 --> 12:28.800
Here. Puppy.

12:37.240 --> 12:39.440
Hey, Dooley.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.640
Hello. How'd you make out?

12:47.920 --> 12:49.880
OK.

12:50.360 --> 12:53.600
l'd like you to meet
a friend of mine. Gay...

12:54.280 --> 12:56.560
Gay Langland, Mrs Taber.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.560
- Howdy do?
- And this is Mrs, uh...?

13:04.680 --> 13:10.120
Steers. lsabelle Steers. One thing about
Reno men, they do remember the name.

13:10.240 --> 13:15.400
- Why don't you boys sit down?
- Thank you. What're you girls drinkin'?

13:15.520 --> 13:18.960
Whiskey. We're celebratin'
the jail burned down.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.840
Mary, see if you can get
four doubles, will you?

13:25.160 --> 13:31.600
Uh... you sure made a big impression
on my friend here. And l can see why.

13:31.720 --> 13:35.240
- You a mechanic too?
- Him? He's a cowboy.

13:35.360 --> 13:38.400
- How'd you know?
- l can smell, can't l?

13:38.520 --> 13:43.320
- Hey, you can't smell cows on me.
- l smell the look on your face, cowboy.

13:43.440 --> 13:46.480
But l love every miserable one of ya.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.200
Course, you're all good for nothin',
as you know.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.280
That may be. But it's better than wages.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.360
l suppose you'll be headin'
back East soon, Mrs Taber?

13:55.480 --> 13:58.240
l can't make up my mind.
l don't know yet what to do.

13:58.360 --> 14:01.240
You don't have a business to run,
or a school to teach, or...?

14:01.360 --> 14:03.960
Me? l never finished high school.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.560
Well! That's real good news.

14:07.160 --> 14:10.160
- You don't like educated women?
- They're all right.

14:10.280 --> 14:13.480
Always wantin' to know
what you're thinkin', that's all.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.560
Maybe they want to get to know you.

14:15.680 --> 14:20.120
Did you ever get to know a man better
by askin' him questions?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.600
- You mean he'd lie?
- Well, he might not.

14:23.720 --> 14:26.200
And then again, he just might.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.520
How about it, Pilot?
We takin' off today?

14:30.640 --> 14:33.240
You ever been outside Reno, Mrs Taber?

14:33.360 --> 14:36.680
l walked to the edge of town.
Doesn't look like much is out there.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.800
Everything's there.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.560
- Like what?
- The country.

14:41.680 --> 14:45.480
- Well, what do you do with yourself?
- Just live.

14:46.120 --> 14:49.640
- How do you just live?
- Well, you start by goin' to sleep.

14:49.760 --> 14:53.520
You get up when you feel like it.
You scratch yourself. You fry some eggs.

14:53.640 --> 14:58.520
You see what kind of a day it is.
You throw stones at a can and whistle.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.840
l know what you mean.

15:01.960 --> 15:05.080
l have an empty house in the country
just beyond Hawleyville.

15:05.200 --> 15:09.240
lt's all yours if you want some
peace and quiet before you go back.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.640
The last woman's gone?

15:11.760 --> 15:14.960
No kiddin'. l never offered it before.

15:16.480 --> 15:20.560
Well, l wouldn't stay there. But let's rent
a car. We could look at the country.

15:20.680 --> 15:24.200
- Gay has a truck. You can have my car.
- Then you'll have to drive me back.

15:24.320 --> 15:28.800
- l don't mind.
- Thanks, but l like to feel l'm on my own.

15:28.920 --> 15:32.000
- l'll rent a car. Where can l?
- Right now?

15:32.120 --> 15:36.200
- Why not?
- OK. You sure don't waste time, do you?

15:37.360 --> 15:39.920
l just gotta stop by the garage and quit.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.360
Hey, now, that's the boy.

15:43.880 --> 15:46.400
No, Gay. This is mine.

15:59.800 --> 16:03.720
Mm. What is that beautiful smell?
Smells like green perfume.

16:03.840 --> 16:06.480
- That's sage, darlin'.
- Oh, sure!

16:06.600 --> 16:10.600
l never smelled it except in bottles.
Gee, it's beautiful here.

16:10.720 --> 16:15.680
Look, dear girl, l think l better
tell you somethin' about cowboys.

16:15.800 --> 16:20.000
- You really worry about me, don't you?
- Well, you're too believin'.

16:20.120 --> 16:22.440
Cowboys are the last real men left,...

16:22.560 --> 16:26.200
..and they're about as reliable
as jack rabbits.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.520
ls anybody any different?

16:28.640 --> 16:32.800
Maybe you're not supposed to believe
people. Maybe it's not even fair to them.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.520
l couldn't hear what he said to her, but
it looked like she left him. The husband.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.840
She's kinda hard to figure out, you know?

16:43.960 --> 16:48.480
One minute she looks kinda dumb
and brand-new, like a kid,...

16:48.600 --> 16:51.160
..and the next minute...

16:51.280 --> 16:55.800
- She sure moves, though, don't she?
- Mm. She's real prime.

17:19.720 --> 17:23.520
- lt isn't finished yet.
- lt's weathertight. Come on in.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.880
lt's insulated.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.760
Flush doors.

17:32.440 --> 17:34.400
This is the living room.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.880
And this was gonna be another bedroom.

17:39.960 --> 17:42.480
lt's even nicer this way.

17:42.600 --> 17:46.200
Here's a picture window.
Take a look at this view.

17:52.600 --> 17:56.920
- Take a look at that.
- Gee. lt goes on for ever.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.440
Fireplace.

18:03.240 --> 18:05.720
- Brick.
- This is the kitchen.

18:05.840 --> 18:08.560
- Gas refrigerator.
- lt's nice.

18:08.680 --> 18:11.680
And here's the bathroom. Ceramic tile.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.680
Here's our... This was our bedroom.

18:18.840 --> 18:22.440
My wife. She died here.

18:25.160 --> 18:27.120
l'm... sorry.

18:27.920 --> 18:33.120
She was due to have a baby. l was up
setting the capstone on the chimney...

18:34.160 --> 18:36.400
..and she screamed...

18:37.320 --> 18:39.440
..and that was that.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.000
Couldn't you call a doctor?

18:45.120 --> 18:50.960
She didn't seem to be that sick.
Then l got a flat. l didn't have a spare.

18:51.080 --> 18:55.160
Everything just happened wrong.
lt'll do that sometimes.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.360
Yeah, l know.

18:58.480 --> 19:01.640
Uh, you couldn't live here any more, huh?

19:01.960 --> 19:05.360
We knew each other
since we were seven years old, see?

19:06.040 --> 19:08.720
You ought to find yourself another girl.

19:08.840 --> 19:13.600
l don't know. Me with anybody else,
it seems impossible, you know?

19:14.200 --> 19:16.480
She wasn't like any other women.

19:16.600 --> 19:20.760
Stood behind me 100 per cent,
uncomplaining as a tree.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.400
Maybe that's what killed her.

19:24.520 --> 19:28.360
l mean, a little complaining
helps sometimes maybe.

19:28.480 --> 19:31.360
Hey, lz, isn't this a beautiful place here?

19:31.480 --> 19:35.920
Yeah. lt'd be just perfect if somebody'd
bring in that bottle of whiskey l bought.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.240
- With my own money.
- Hey, that's right!

19:38.360 --> 19:41.760
And bring that bag of groceries.
Maybe somebody wants a sandwich.

19:41.880 --> 19:46.320
The glasses are in the kitchen, lsabelle.
l'm real tired.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.560
No, you're just a cowboy, darlin'.

19:48.680 --> 19:52.480
You fellas won't move
unless it's rainin' down your necks.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.440
Too rough for you, Roslyn?

19:59.120 --> 20:01.320
l don't mind that.

20:01.440 --> 20:05.880
You should've seen his wife. She helped
pour cement and knocked in nails.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.560
She was a real good sport.

20:09.120 --> 20:12.480
Now she's dead because
he didn't have a spare tyre.

20:12.600 --> 20:15.120
Well, that's the way it goes.

20:15.240 --> 20:18.920
lt goes the other way too, though.
Don't forget that.

20:19.040 --> 20:22.200
lt's sure nice to see people in here.
Come on, let's have a drink.

20:22.320 --> 20:27.360
- l'll start the fridge. lt makes ice quick.
- lce? We gonna stay that long, Roslyn?

20:27.480 --> 20:30.480
- l don't know.
- Oh, sure. Come on.

20:30.600 --> 20:35.480
There's no better place to be. And you
couldn't find better company, either.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.080
- All right.
- That's it, sport.

20:38.200 --> 20:41.880
Turn on that ice, Guido. Let's get this stuff
a-flowin', make the desert bloom.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.280
Well, flow it slow. We only got one bottle.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.840
There. Put that in your thoughts
and see how they come out.

20:47.960 --> 20:52.040
Come on, sit down, everybody.
Let's get comfortable.

20:55.760 --> 21:00.360
- l'm sure glad you like this place.
- Here's to Nevada, the ''leave it'' state.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.640
- The what state?
- The ''leave it'' state.

21:02.760 --> 21:05.240
You got money to gamble, leave it here.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.800
A wife you wanna get rid of,
get rid of her here.

21:07.920 --> 21:12.280
Extra atom bomb you don't need, blow it
up here. Nobody will mind in the slightest.

21:12.400 --> 21:16.880
The slogan of Nevada is ''Anything goes,
but don't complain if it went.''

21:17.840 --> 21:21.240
- That's no lie.
- l even left my Southern accent here.

21:21.360 --> 21:25.960
How come you never went back home?
You came here for a divorce, didn't you?

21:26.080 --> 21:28.840
- l wasn't beautiful enough to go back.
- Oh, lsabelle.

21:28.960 --> 21:34.440
No, that's true. Beauty's a help any place,
but in Virginia it's a necessity.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.360
Why, you can't hardly
get a driver's licence without it.

21:37.480 --> 21:42.160
No, l love Nevada. You know, they don't
even have regular meal times here.

21:42.280 --> 21:45.040
Never met so many people
didn't own a watch.

21:45.160 --> 21:49.720
Might have two wives at the same time,
but no watch. Bless them all.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.160
How quiet it is here.

21:52.280 --> 21:54.560
Sweetest sound there is.

21:54.680 --> 21:59.720
There's an lndian store about five miles,
if you wanna shop. Groceries, everything.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.120
lf you wanna stay, that is.

22:02.240 --> 22:05.640
Be glad to come by
and do your chores, if you like.

22:05.760 --> 22:10.800
You know, he reminds me of that
cowboy friend l told you about.

22:10.920 --> 22:14.080
Had one arm gone, but he was
more man with one arm...

22:14.200 --> 22:16.400
..than any other man is with two.

22:16.520 --> 22:17.880
Oh?

22:18.000 --> 22:21.200
- l mean like cookin'.
- Oh!

22:21.320 --> 22:24.640
No, l'm serious. He could take
a panful of chops, toss 'em,...

22:24.760 --> 22:26.960
..and they all came down
on the other side.

22:27.080 --> 22:31.840
- Who is he? Maybe they know him.
- Darlin', you can't go lookin' for a man.

22:31.960 --> 22:35.080
- What, did he take off?
- No, not exactly.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.560
He just never came back.

22:41.080 --> 22:44.640
- Andy Powell. You ever...?
- Sure! Called Andy Gump sometimes?

22:44.760 --> 22:46.720
That's him.

22:46.840 --> 22:50.280
- You know where he is?
- Saw him at the rodeo only last month.

22:50.400 --> 22:55.160
- Maybe we could find him.
- Stop thinkin' you can change things.

22:55.640 --> 22:58.000
But if there's something you can do...

22:58.120 --> 23:01.480
l don't know what to do,
but if l knew, l'd do it.

23:02.320 --> 23:06.480
Have you got a radio or a phonograph?
Maybe we'll have some music.

23:06.600 --> 23:09.960
- There's no electricity.
- The car radio.

23:10.080 --> 23:14.440
- Now who'd have thought of that?
- You always get an idea, don't you?

23:14.560 --> 23:16.800
l'll go bring the car round.

23:18.360 --> 23:21.920
Say, how about another drink
to keep that first one warm?

23:22.040 --> 23:25.560
- l'd love it.
- l'm gonna make myself a sandwich.

23:25.680 --> 23:28.200
- How about you folks?
- OK.

23:29.280 --> 23:32.280
l hope you're gonna stay on here.
Any chance?

23:32.400 --> 23:34.600
Why? What difference would it make?

23:34.720 --> 23:38.200
Might make all the difference in the world
as time goes by.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.360
( dance music)

23:40.480 --> 23:43.200
- Like to dance?
- OK.

23:54.400 --> 23:58.880
Thanks. lz, give him another drink.
lt's a wonderful house, Guido.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.760
Hey, that's pretty good dancin', cowboy.

24:02.320 --> 24:04.280
What are you doin'?

24:04.400 --> 24:08.120
She used to teach dancin'.
You know? Before she was married.

24:08.240 --> 24:11.640
- No kiddin'? ln a dance hall?
- Uh-huh.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.600
How about the landlord?
Move over, boy, huh?

24:16.720 --> 24:20.760
- Watch out for those pretty little feet.
- She knows how to get out of the way.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.840
Let's go.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.960
Where'd you learn that, Pilot?

24:44.560 --> 24:46.800
l never knew him to dance at all.

24:50.480 --> 24:54.320
Look at old Pilot comin' out
from under a bushel!

24:57.680 --> 25:00.480
Hey, you two ought to put on a show!

25:24.160 --> 25:27.040
(music ends, new piece begins)

25:27.160 --> 25:32.000
Come on, honey. This is a good one.
l haven't danced like this in years.

25:35.160 --> 25:40.320
- Didn't your wife dance?
- Not like you. She had no gracefulness.

25:40.440 --> 25:43.200
Why didn't you teach her to be graceful?

25:43.320 --> 25:45.840
You can't learn that.

25:45.960 --> 25:49.560
How do you know?
l mean, how do you know?

25:49.680 --> 25:53.720
You see, she died, and she didn't
know how you can dance.

25:53.840 --> 25:57.440
To a certain extent,
maybe you were strangers.

25:58.400 --> 26:02.080
- l don't feel like discussing my wife.
- Don't be mad.

26:02.200 --> 26:05.760
l only meant that if you loved her
you could've taught her anything.

26:05.880 --> 26:09.480
Because... we're all dying, aren't we?

26:10.520 --> 26:14.360
All the husbands and all the wives.
Every minute.

26:15.120 --> 26:19.360
And we're not teaching each other
what we really know, are we?

26:19.480 --> 26:21.880
Dum da-da... dum...

26:22.000 --> 26:24.480
Guido, you're a nice man.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.520
Smile.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.360
Come on.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.280
(drunken laughter)

27:04.800 --> 27:08.720
- Come on, lz.
- l'm lookin' for your shoes, dear girl.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.840
(Gay) Watch out. There's no step!

28:05.960 --> 28:08.320
We better get you home, girl.

28:09.240 --> 28:13.000
You were worried about me. How sweet.

28:13.920 --> 28:16.960
Just wanna keep you
all in one pretty piece.

28:17.920 --> 28:20.200
Would you have had a spare tyre?

28:20.320 --> 28:22.920
(lz) Somebody'd better drive her.

28:26.520 --> 28:28.920
Go ahead. l'll take the truck.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.800
Oh, lz, don't leave poor Guido alone.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.880
Tom Dooley!

29:09.120 --> 29:11.480
You're a real beautiful woman.

29:14.720 --> 29:18.040
lt's almost kind of an honour
sittin' next to you.

29:18.160 --> 29:22.680
You just shine in my eyes.
That's my true feelin', Roslyn.

29:27.680 --> 29:32.520
What makes you so sad? l think
you're the saddest girl l ever met.

29:33.560 --> 29:38.760
You're the first man that ever said that.
l'm usually told how happy l am.

29:38.880 --> 29:42.280
That's because you make
a man feel happy.

29:44.640 --> 29:47.480
l don't feel that way about you, Gay.

29:52.320 --> 29:55.840
Well, don't get discouraged, girl.
You might.

29:57.680 --> 30:02.440
Look, why don't you try it out here
for a while, see what happens?

30:02.560 --> 30:05.480
You know, sometimes when
a person don't know what to do,...

30:05.600 --> 30:08.960
..the best thing is to just stand still.

30:09.920 --> 30:15.600
l'll guarantee you'll have something out
here you wouldn't find on every corner.

30:15.720 --> 30:21.600
l, uh... l may not amount to much
in some ways, but l am a good friend.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.360
Thanks.

30:28.560 --> 30:33.880
Let me take you back and get your things.
Try it for a while, see what happens.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.720
Ever hear the story
about the city man out in the country?

30:37.840 --> 30:42.000
He sees this fella sittin' on his porch,
so he says ''Mister,...

30:42.120 --> 30:47.040
..could you tell me how l can get back
to town?'' The fella says ''No.''

30:47.160 --> 30:52.280
''Well, could you tell me how to get
to the post office?'' The fella says ''No.''

30:52.400 --> 30:56.440
''Well, do you know how to get
to the railroad station?'' ''No.''

30:56.560 --> 30:59.760
''Boy,'' he says, ''you sure
don't know much, do you?''

30:59.880 --> 31:02.600
The fella says ''Nope. But l ain't lost.''

31:10.960 --> 31:13.200
Don't you have a home?

31:14.320 --> 31:17.720
Sure. Never was a better one, either.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.800
Where is it?

31:22.200 --> 31:24.160
Right here.

32:18.200 --> 32:21.240
Come on. l got a surprise for you.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.720
You cooked breakfast. Here, let me.

32:48.840 --> 32:53.120
No, no, no. You sit down
and enjoy yourself. Just this once.

32:53.880 --> 32:57.400
- You do this often?
- Uh-uh. First time for me.

32:58.520 --> 33:01.320
- Really and truly?
- Mm-hm.

33:02.200 --> 33:04.480
Mm. Smells delicious.

33:09.680 --> 33:12.080
Hey, you really go all out, don't you?

33:12.200 --> 33:16.760
Even the way you eat. l like that.
Women generally pick.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.840
You like me, huh?

33:18.960 --> 33:20.880
(birdsong)

33:21.000 --> 33:25.720
Birds must be brave to live out here.
At night especially.

33:25.840 --> 33:29.000
- Whereas they're so small, you know?
- Mm-hm.

33:30.920 --> 33:35.120
- You think l'm crazy.
- l look that way cos l can't make you out.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.920
- Why?
- l don't know.

33:38.040 --> 33:40.560
You got children?

33:41.360 --> 33:44.320
- l never wanted children with him.
- Oh.

33:46.400 --> 33:51.280
Children are supposed to bring you
together. But what if they don't?

33:53.080 --> 33:56.920
l've known of so-called
happily married couples.

33:57.040 --> 34:01.600
One time, the wife was in the hospital
to have the baby...

34:01.720 --> 34:04.520
..and the husband was calling me up.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.640
l mean, he was calling me.

34:08.719 --> 34:11.719
They're still supposed
to be happily married.

34:11.840 --> 34:14.360
l guess you believe in true love,
don't you?

34:14.480 --> 34:18.080
l don't know, but they ought to invent
a way that you don't have children...

34:18.199 --> 34:21.480
..unless you care for each other,
cos kids know the difference.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.719
l always knew the difference.

34:23.840 --> 34:27.760
Listen, if you wanna go somewhere,
l don't mind being alone.

34:27.880 --> 34:33.360
- Do l look like l wanna leave?
- l just want you to do what you feel like.

34:33.480 --> 34:38.600
You ain't kiddin'. Even when
you're kiddin', you ain't kiddin'.

34:38.719 --> 34:41.159
No. lt makes me feel peaceful.

34:42.360 --> 34:46.159
You know, they come out here
from New York, Chicago, St Louis,...

34:46.280 --> 34:49.880
..and find them a cowboy. Cowboys
are supposed to be dumb, you know.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.800
So they tell 'em everything.
And they do everything.

34:52.920 --> 34:55.679
Everything they couldn't do back home.

34:55.800 --> 34:58.080
- lt's pitiful.
- Why is it pitiful?

34:58.200 --> 35:02.400
Cowboy's laughin' at 'em,
and they don't even know it.

35:02.520 --> 35:06.440
lt's nice to meet someone
who has respect for a man.

35:06.560 --> 35:09.240
Did you ever think
of getting married again?

35:09.360 --> 35:14.160
Yeah. l've thought about it a lot of times.
But never in daylight.

35:16.800 --> 35:20.040
- You get lonesome for your children?
- Oh, l see 'em now and then.

35:20.160 --> 35:24.520
They come whenever l'm in a rodeo.
l'm a pretty good roper.

35:27.520 --> 35:30.120
l get lonesome, sure.

35:30.240 --> 35:35.520
My daughter is almost your size.
Uh... You size 1 2?

35:35.640 --> 35:38.000
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah. So is she.

35:38.120 --> 35:41.480
l bought her a dress for Christmas.
Size 1 2.

35:44.080 --> 35:48.280
What happened?
Did you just stop loving your wife, Gay?

35:48.400 --> 35:53.000
Well, l come home one night and
she's all wrapped up in a car with a fella.

35:53.120 --> 35:57.320
Turned out to be an old friend.
A cousin of mine, as a matter of fact.

35:57.440 --> 36:00.200
Oh. You never had any idea, huh?

36:00.320 --> 36:04.880
No. You know, in those days
l thought you got married and that was it.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.760
But nothin' is it. Not for ever.

36:09.600 --> 36:13.200
That's what l can't get used to.
Everything keeps changing.

36:15.600 --> 36:21.120
l'll tell you this, though. l wouldn't know
how to say goodbye to you, Roslyn.

36:22.280 --> 36:25.000
lt surprises me.

36:29.400 --> 36:33.560
There's a lot to be done around this place.
lf we were gonna stay awhile.

36:33.680 --> 36:36.440
Let's go out in the sunshine. Come on.

36:42.440 --> 36:47.480
Let's just live like you said in the bar.
l don't know where l am yet.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.640
Hey! Couldn't we use that for a step?

36:54.000 --> 36:56.400
Well, we just might at that.

37:10.320 --> 37:13.200
- There you are.
- Let me try it.

37:13.320 --> 37:16.920
lt's perfect. l can go in...
and l can come out.

37:18.320 --> 37:21.280
Go in... and l can come out.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.760
Go in...

37:24.880 --> 37:27.040
..and l can come out.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.800
l can go in...

37:29.920 --> 37:32.120
..and l can come out.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.480
(airplane)

38:29.200 --> 38:31.360
Guido!

38:31.760 --> 38:36.040
- What's he doing?
- Might land. There's a place back there.

38:40.960 --> 38:44.000
Nah. l guess he's just sayin' hello.

38:44.120 --> 38:47.240
- Here, have some lemonade.
- Oh, thanks.

38:48.400 --> 38:51.640
- What does he do? Just fly around?
- Could be goin' for eagles.

38:51.760 --> 38:54.120
Now and again ranchers
hire Guido to shoot eagles.

38:54.240 --> 38:57.520
- Why?
- Well, they kill a lot of lambs.

38:57.640 --> 39:00.080
He gets $50 a bird.

39:01.400 --> 39:04.280
l never really saw anything grow before.

39:04.400 --> 39:10.240
How tiny those seeds were. And yet they
know they're supposed to be lettuces.

39:10.360 --> 39:13.960
You say the darnedest things.
You know that, don't you?

39:14.080 --> 39:17.680
Everybody's busy in Chicago,
and here we are.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.120
l love this whole state!

39:24.280 --> 39:26.720
Hey... What have we here now?

39:27.960 --> 39:31.480
Well... Just plain old rabbit!

39:33.000 --> 39:35.320
l'm gonna get him.

39:35.440 --> 39:38.160
lt's just one lettuce.
Maybe he won't do it any more.

39:38.280 --> 39:43.240
No, ma'am! lt's them or us! There won't
be a thing left inside of a week.

39:43.360 --> 39:47.040
Couldn't you wait and see?
l can't stand to see anything killed.

39:47.160 --> 39:51.440
- Honey, it's only a rabbit.
- But it doesn't know any better, does it?

39:51.560 --> 39:53.680
Go on inside and let me handle this.

39:53.800 --> 39:56.440
- l know you worked hard...
- You're darn right!

39:56.560 --> 40:00.160
And l didn't do it
for some bug-eyed rabbit.

40:00.280 --> 40:03.640
- Gay, please.
- Honey, will you go on inside now?

40:03.760 --> 40:07.240
- And stop bein' silly?
- l'm not being silly.

40:07.360 --> 40:09.560
You don't respect what l feel.

40:09.680 --> 40:12.720
- And l don't care about the lettuce!
- l care about it!

40:12.840 --> 40:15.720
And how about havin'
some respect for me?

40:16.640 --> 40:18.800
Oh, Guido and lsabelle!

40:18.920 --> 40:20.880
- Guido!
- Dear girl!

40:21.000 --> 40:24.520
l thought l saw a passenger!
We never heard you land.

40:24.640 --> 40:28.720
- My, you look thrivin'.
- Boy, am l in the right place?

40:28.840 --> 40:32.360
Seen the vegetable garden?
Took Gay a week just to turn the soil.

40:32.480 --> 40:34.800
Mowed the grass
and put in them flowers too.

40:34.920 --> 40:37.760
l got your windows unstuck.
Fireplace don't smoke now.

40:37.880 --> 40:43.080
You must be a magician. All he ever did
for a woman was get out the ice cubes.

40:43.200 --> 40:46.400
- Look, we have chairs. Come and sit.
- Let's show him the inside.

40:46.520 --> 40:51.200
You know, l've moved this furniture
so many times, l'm gettin' long ears!

40:51.760 --> 40:55.840
My, you look lovely. You've really
found yourself, haven't you?

40:55.960 --> 41:00.160
Well, l... Oh, it's so nice to see you,
lsabelle. Look, we have a step.

41:00.280 --> 41:03.760
- How's your arm?
- Well, it's still as weak as a bird's wing.

41:04.640 --> 41:09.080
Well, l never saw anything like it
in my life. lt's magical.

41:09.200 --> 41:12.840
Just hope you realise you finally
made contact with a real woman.

41:12.960 --> 41:15.000
My dear girl!

41:15.120 --> 41:20.160
Come, Guido. l wanna show you the rest.
l've changed a few things, though.

41:22.040 --> 41:24.480
We've changed things around.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.200
How do you like it?

41:28.760 --> 41:32.360
Oh, don't look at those.
Gay just hung 'em up for a joke.

41:32.480 --> 41:35.360
l put your picture up in the living room.

41:36.680 --> 41:39.880
Come on, let's have lots of drinks.
Come on.

41:43.440 --> 41:45.840
Oh, it's so nice to have company.

41:51.120 --> 41:55.440
- l put your picture there. ls that all right?
- You don't have to keep it out.

41:55.560 --> 41:59.720
Why, Guido, it's part of the house.
Besides, it's your house.

41:59.840 --> 42:02.960
Oh, sit in the big chair.
This must've been your chair.

42:03.080 --> 42:05.080
Matter of fact, it was.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.880
lsabelle. Put this under your arm.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.960
Thanks, dear girl.

42:11.040 --> 42:14.840
l used to do all my studyin' in this chair.
When l was still ambitious.

42:14.960 --> 42:16.720
What did you study?

42:16.840 --> 42:19.880
l was on my way to bein' a doctor.
Before the war.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.520
Well, you never can tell.
Maybe you'll get ambitious again.

42:23.640 --> 42:26.400
l'm gonna tell you somethin', Roslyn.

42:26.520 --> 42:31.160
l spent four years in the war.
Did two tours, flew 50 missions.

42:31.640 --> 42:35.560
Every time l came back to base
l started to design this house.

42:35.680 --> 42:39.360
But somehow l could never
get it to look like my idea of it.

42:39.760 --> 42:42.280
Now it almost does.

42:42.400 --> 42:45.040
You just walk in,
a stranger out of nowhere,...

42:45.160 --> 42:48.120
..and for the first time it all lights up.

42:49.320 --> 42:51.720
And l'm sure you know why too.

42:52.640 --> 42:56.160
- Why?
- Because you have the gift for life.

42:56.480 --> 43:01.280
The rest of us, we're just lookin' for
a place to hide and watch it all go by.

43:01.400 --> 43:03.360
Amen.

43:04.120 --> 43:08.160
Here's to your life, Roslyn.
l hope it goes on for ever.

43:08.280 --> 43:10.760
And yours. And yours, lsabelle.

43:11.600 --> 43:15.080
And Gay. Gay did all the work, you know.

43:15.200 --> 43:19.280
Yeah. And the rabbits
are sure enjoyin' it too.

43:19.400 --> 43:24.280
Can you break away from this paradise
long enough to do a little mustangin'?

43:24.400 --> 43:28.720
Mustangin'? Now you're sayin' somethin'.
You been up in the mountains?

43:29.200 --> 43:33.600
Took a quick look earlier this mornin'.
l spotted 1 5 horses.

43:33.720 --> 43:35.960
That's not too bad.

43:36.560 --> 43:40.040
Boy, l'd sure like
to get my hands on a rope again.

43:41.280 --> 43:44.200
- What do you say?
- (lz) l will never understand cowboys.

43:44.320 --> 43:47.720
All crazy about animals, and
the minute they got nothin' else to do,...

43:47.840 --> 43:51.200
..they run up in the mountains
and bother those poor wild horses.

43:51.320 --> 43:53.520
Shame on you!

43:53.640 --> 43:55.560
Horses?

43:55.680 --> 43:59.640
Sure. Nevada mustang. Used
to ship 'em all over the United States.

43:59.760 --> 44:03.520
Not many left.
We'd have to pick up another man.

44:03.640 --> 44:07.240
Dayton Rodeo's on today. We ought
to be able to pick up a fella there.

44:07.360 --> 44:10.760
That's an idea.
Hey, you never saw a rodeo.

44:10.880 --> 44:12.880
(lz) Oh, you gotta see a rodeo!

44:13.000 --> 44:16.040
- l'd love to. Will you come too?
- l'm all set.

44:16.640 --> 44:20.480
- l'll get dressed up. Let's have some fun!
- That's a girl. Go right now.

44:20.600 --> 44:24.720
Honey, when you smile
it's like the sun comin' up.

44:32.120 --> 44:35.240
Boy, l'd like to have stopped off home
and get cleaned up.

44:35.360 --> 44:37.960
Why? You look nice. Doesn't he?

44:38.080 --> 44:43.480
- Lots better than some l've known.
- You're a mass of compliments, lsabelle.

44:44.520 --> 44:48.360
Hey, Gay, stop. That guy next
to the phone booth. What's his name?

44:48.480 --> 44:51.960
- You worked the Stinson Rodeo with him.
- Perce Howland?

44:52.080 --> 44:54.920
Gay Langland! You old buzzard, you!

44:55.280 --> 44:57.920
What are you doin' sittin' out here, fella?

44:58.040 --> 45:00.640
Well, l hitched a ride
down to the Dayton Rodeo,...

45:00.760 --> 45:04.000
..but this fella changed his mind
and just left me settin' here.

45:04.120 --> 45:06.240
Roslyn, this is Perce Howland.

45:06.360 --> 45:09.560
Well, old Gay's sure comin' up
in the world. How do, ma'am?

45:09.680 --> 45:11.720
- This is lsabelle.
- (phone rings)

45:11.840 --> 45:16.000
Oh, 'scuse me. l got a call in for home,
but they keep puttin' me in to Wyoming.

45:16.120 --> 45:18.160
Hello?

45:18.280 --> 45:20.440
Hello?

45:20.560 --> 45:22.920
Hello, Ma? This is Perce.

45:23.920 --> 45:26.080
Yeah, l'm OK.

45:26.200 --> 45:28.960
No. l was in Colorado. l'm in Nevada now.

45:29.480 --> 45:31.840
Just won me a bull ride.

45:32.400 --> 45:34.360
Yeah.

45:35.200 --> 45:37.880
Yeah, a pretty good rodeo.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.320
A hundred dollars.

45:41.760 --> 45:45.360
Ma, l was gonna buy you
a birthday present with it,...

45:45.480 --> 45:48.160
..but l was comin' out of my boots.

45:49.640 --> 45:55.280
No, Ma, l haven't been in hospital since
l talked to you. l just bought some boots.

45:56.360 --> 45:59.960
Ma, what would l wanna get married for?
l just bought me...

46:01.880 --> 46:07.360
Hey, you know what? On top of purse
money, l won me a nice silver buckle.

46:07.480 --> 46:12.520
Yeah. Got a buckin' horse on it and
my entire name written out underneath.

46:12.640 --> 46:15.120
You proud?

46:15.240 --> 46:19.360
Oh, no, no. My face is fine. lt's all
healed up. lt's just as good as new.

46:20.200 --> 46:23.000
You would too recognise me.

46:23.120 --> 46:27.520
Oh, OK, operator. Ma, listen.
Say hello to Frieda for me, will you?

46:27.640 --> 46:31.160
And to Victoria.
Yeah, and to Uncle George.

46:33.720 --> 46:36.320
OK, say hello to him too.

46:37.360 --> 46:41.200
No, no, Ma. lt just
slipped my mind, that's all.

46:41.320 --> 46:43.960
Well, OK, l'm sayin' it now.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.800
Ma, you married him, l didn't.
So say hello to him.

46:50.280 --> 46:54.840
Oh, is that...? Listen, maybe
l'll call you at Christmas time.

46:55.840 --> 46:57.560
OK.

46:57.680 --> 47:00.040
Hello? Hello?

47:03.520 --> 47:05.880
God bless you too.

47:09.760 --> 47:12.080
l just know you'll take me to that rodeo.

47:12.200 --> 47:14.240
Sure. You entered?

47:14.360 --> 47:17.920
Well, l aim to be,
if l can get me a ride to town.

47:18.040 --> 47:21.360
And, uh, if l can raise $10
for the entrance.

47:21.480 --> 47:26.320
But l just spent my last $2 in that phone
booth. Boy, l'm real equipped, ain't l?

47:26.440 --> 47:30.960
Say, how'd you like to do some
mustangin'? We need a third man.

47:31.080 --> 47:33.440
You still fly that DC-6 and seven eighths?

47:33.560 --> 47:35.880
lt's a lot safer than buckin' horses.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.680
- There are still mustangs around here?
- l spotted 1 5 this morning.

47:39.800 --> 47:42.920
- There might be a lot more, though.
- Well, l don't know.

47:43.040 --> 47:45.640
What do you expect to get out of it?
Of 1 5 horses?

47:45.760 --> 47:48.600
l mean, like, if there was
a thousand or more...

47:48.720 --> 47:52.640
But goin' all the way up there for 1 5,
it kinda hits me sideways.

47:52.760 --> 47:56.400
- Better than wages, ain't it?
- Oh, anything's better than wages.

47:56.520 --> 48:00.560
l tell you what. We'll drive you to
the rodeo, put up the ten for the entrance.

48:00.680 --> 48:03.680
You come along tomorrow
and help us run some mustang.

48:03.800 --> 48:08.920
All right. You get me a good bottle of
whiskey to keep me primed for the rodeo.

48:09.040 --> 48:11.400
Just wait right here.

48:16.360 --> 48:19.600
You, uh... you an old friend of Gay's?

48:21.600 --> 48:23.720
Pretty old.

48:25.080 --> 48:28.520
l broke my arm twice -
no, three times, in the same place.

48:28.640 --> 48:31.280
And you don't do that fakin' a fall.

48:31.400 --> 48:33.640
You know what some of these riders do?

48:33.760 --> 48:37.080
They just drop off and lay there
like they was stone-dead.

48:37.200 --> 48:41.040
Not me, boy. l don't fake nothin'.
Right, Gay?

48:41.160 --> 48:44.560
That's right.
You're just a natural-born fool.

48:44.680 --> 48:47.600
lt's wonderful to be that way.
l know what you mean.

48:47.720 --> 48:50.760
l used to dance in places,
and everybody thought l was crazy.

48:50.880 --> 48:53.880
l mean, l really tried.
People don't know the difference.

48:54.000 --> 48:58.800
- Oh, she'd try. l can just see her tryin'.
- What kind of dancin' do you do?

48:58.920 --> 49:02.800
Oh, interpretive dancing.
You know, nightclubs and... That's all.

49:02.920 --> 49:07.840
l was in a nightclub once
in Kansas City called The Naked Truth.

49:08.680 --> 49:11.080
And they wasn't kiddin'!

49:11.840 --> 49:14.040
Dayton comin' up.

49:18.120 --> 49:20.760
Hey, Joe! Hi, Joe!

49:25.560 --> 49:27.920
Hey, Bengie! Hey!

49:28.640 --> 49:31.120
Hi, you old heathen, you!

49:32.800 --> 49:36.160
- Hey, gimme.
- Hiya, Perce.

49:36.280 --> 49:38.880
Oh, there's Franklin.
Boy, does he hate his wife.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.920
Hey, Franklin, how's your wife?

49:44.400 --> 49:49.120
Man, there are a lot of good men here.
l sure hope l drew me a good horse.

49:49.240 --> 49:53.920
Just come out in one piece now,
cos you gotta go mustangin' tomorrow.

49:57.560 --> 49:59.520
(Gay sounds horn)

50:16.680 --> 50:19.480
- Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
- Sure.

50:19.600 --> 50:23.320
- How about you, sinner?
- Oh, l got no money yet.

50:23.440 --> 50:27.200
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.

50:27.520 --> 50:31.520
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.

50:32.480 --> 50:37.560
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
Frank, Church Ladies' Auxiliary.

50:37.680 --> 50:41.560
- You just caught me at the bar next door.
- That'll learn you to stay put.

50:41.680 --> 50:46.240
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
Church Ladies' Auxiliary...

50:50.960 --> 50:53.440
Come on, l'll buy you a drink.

50:54.400 --> 50:58.600
Excuse me, cousin.
There ain't many of us left now.

50:58.720 --> 51:01.400
No. Things is tough all over, pop.

51:02.200 --> 51:08.080
Come on, son. Give me a great big glass
of soda pop for my grandson Lester.

51:08.200 --> 51:12.640
l gotta hold onto him tight,
otherwise he'll run off to school.

51:13.520 --> 51:15.920
Hey, wait till l show you this.

51:16.040 --> 51:20.120
Here is the goldarnedest contraption
that anybody ever seen.

51:20.240 --> 51:23.160
You gotta hit the ball.

51:23.280 --> 51:26.240
- You catch what l mean?
- l can do it. Let me try.

51:26.360 --> 51:29.120
l'll bet you $2 you can't hit it
ten times in a row.

51:29.240 --> 51:31.880
Wait. l'll take that bet.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.440
- Go on. Go on.
- l can do ten, l think.

51:34.560 --> 51:39.240
Here's the paddle. Gangway,
gangway, everybody. Got a bet on.

51:39.360 --> 51:42.720
..2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,...

51:42.840 --> 51:46.840
..1 1 , 1 2, 1 3, 14, 1 5, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,...

51:46.960 --> 51:51.040
..1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 30...

51:54.560 --> 51:56.520
40.

51:57.360 --> 52:00.360
(counting continues)

52:01.880 --> 52:04.240
(betting)

52:25.320 --> 52:27.680
..5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

52:40.840 --> 52:43.760
Here, do it while the spirit's in you.

53:03.040 --> 53:06.000
- Here, here. What's the trouble?
- He put his hand on her.

53:06.120 --> 53:08.600
- That right, fella?
- l didn't mean nothin' by it.

53:08.720 --> 53:13.320
- What's goin' on? You lookin' for a fight?
- All right, all right. Let's get to the rodeo.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.680
Here. lt's the kid's.

53:16.720 --> 53:18.920
lsabelle, come on.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.920
Lester! Where'd you get the money?

53:31.680 --> 53:33.640
A-ha-ha!

53:35.120 --> 53:38.680
One hundred... One hundred
and forty-five bucks!

53:38.800 --> 53:42.160
- Hello, gold mine.
- That girl can do anything.

53:42.280 --> 53:44.560
l'd marry you.

53:44.680 --> 53:48.400
Thanks for saying it,
but you don't have to do that.

53:48.520 --> 53:53.000
Don't shake that thing at me!
l'm still payin' for this broken arm.

53:54.040 --> 53:56.280
Charles!

53:56.760 --> 54:00.520
lt's in the middle of your pretty eyes.
You're looking for the light, sinner.

54:00.640 --> 54:03.800
l know you, and l love you
for your life of pain and sin.

54:03.920 --> 54:07.800
Give it to the only one
who loves you in your lonely desert.

54:07.920 --> 54:12.320
- She ain't sinned that much.
- We're going to fence off the graveyard.

54:12.440 --> 54:15.680
Keep these cowboys from pasturing
their horses on the graves.

54:15.800 --> 54:21.760
Sweetheart, you've gone and helped
our dead to rest in peace. Go reborn.

54:21.880 --> 54:25.920
Who do you think is here, dear girl?
Who do you think is here?

54:26.040 --> 54:28.680
- Who?
- My husband.

54:30.600 --> 54:32.560
Oh, lz! l'm so happy.

54:32.680 --> 54:37.240
l never was so surprised.
They're here on their vacation.

54:38.080 --> 54:40.920
- His wife?
- Clara. You've heard me speak about her.

54:41.040 --> 54:43.920
She's my oldest friend,
and she's sweeter than ever.

54:44.040 --> 54:46.640
She must be, to make you
so glad to see her.

54:46.760 --> 54:51.160
Charles never would've stayed married to
me. l even lost the vacuum cleaner once.

54:51.280 --> 54:53.320
They still haven't found it.

54:53.440 --> 54:57.880
- Well, we gotta get this boy on a horse.
- l'll be around. But l can't go mustangin'.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.840
They're gonna stay
at my house for a week.

55:00.960 --> 55:04.280
- Good luck, boy. So long.
- Oh, lsabelle...

55:07.320 --> 55:09.280
(crowd cheers)

55:15.280 --> 55:19.920
(announcer) Jim Palem in the saddle,
now ready to go on Polka Dot, gate one.

55:21.080 --> 55:23.320
Here he comes.

55:31.120 --> 55:35.000
- l didn't know it was that dangerous!
- That's the way they want it.

55:35.120 --> 55:39.080
Look. See that strap they've taken off?
That's what makes 'em buck.

55:39.200 --> 55:42.600
- That grabs 'em where they don't like it.
- That's not fair!

55:42.720 --> 55:45.520
Well, you wouldn't
have a rodeo otherwise.

55:45.640 --> 55:48.600
Then they shouldn't have a rodeo.

55:49.560 --> 55:51.520
(laughter)

55:52.000 --> 55:54.600
Lester, what are you tryin' to do?!

56:01.680 --> 56:06.880
- Don't break it, Grandpa.
- Don't get mad about it. Come on, Lester.

56:12.960 --> 56:15.960
- l hope you're sober.
- Man, l've won buckets of money...

56:16.080 --> 56:18.680
..in towns l couldn't remember the name.

56:18.800 --> 56:21.120
Hey, there she is.

56:22.080 --> 56:24.440
l mean, there they are.

56:25.480 --> 56:29.640
Gay, l wouldn't, uh...
l wouldn't wanna move in on you.

56:30.520 --> 56:34.720
- Unless, of course, you wouldn't mind.
- Boy, l'd mind.

56:41.680 --> 56:44.800
The next rider is Perce Howland
ofBlack River, Wyoming.

56:44.920 --> 56:47.200
- California, not Wyoming.
- Ready, boy?

56:47.320 --> 56:49.320
- Outside.
- Open the gate!

56:53.680 --> 56:54.320
Come on, Perce!

56:59.520 --> 57:02.040
Perce! Perce!

57:03.280 --> 57:05.240
(crowd applauds)

57:17.960 --> 57:20.200
- Thanks, Jim.
- OK.

57:20.320 --> 57:24.240
- Where's... Where's my hat, Pa?
- You got it on, Perce.

57:24.360 --> 57:27.080
- You're bleeding!
- Frieda! l'm all right.

57:27.200 --> 57:29.160
She ain't your sister.

57:29.280 --> 57:32.960
Looks like you've been messing around
with the wrong end of the horse.

57:33.080 --> 57:36.400
- Are you a doctor?
- Doctor? l don't want a doctor.

57:36.520 --> 57:39.480
Hold it, boy. l'm no doctor.
l'll just clean you up.

57:39.600 --> 57:42.600
- lsn't there a doctor?
- Not for 60 miles. He ain't bad hurt.

57:42.720 --> 57:45.640
How do you know?
Let's take him. Come with me.

57:45.760 --> 57:48.720
Now don't start running things, Roslyn.

57:48.840 --> 57:53.680
- l don't understand. He's your friend.
- You're all right, ain't you, Perce?

57:53.800 --> 57:56.720
- Perce, you all right?
- Did l make the whistle?

57:56.840 --> 57:59.200
Almost, boy. You done good, though.

57:59.320 --> 58:02.120
That old horse, he sure
was rank, wasn't he?

58:02.240 --> 58:05.200
Oh, he was a real killer! You done good.

58:05.760 --> 58:09.160
- Leave him. He'll get up.
- Next event is the Brahma bull riding.

58:09.280 --> 58:13.400
- Oh. That's me.
- No, not yet. You got a couple of minutes.

58:13.520 --> 58:17.640
- What for?
- He's got a bull to ride. Walk around a bit.

58:17.760 --> 58:22.000
- Guido, he's not going in there again?
- l guess he wants to ride that bull.

58:23.080 --> 58:25.120
Just let him walk it off, Roz.

58:25.240 --> 58:29.160
Why are you doing it? Take the money
we won in the bar. You helped me win it.

58:29.280 --> 58:33.440
Come on, take it. lt's over $100.
You don't have to go back in there.

58:33.560 --> 58:36.960
l'm pretty good ridin' bulls.
l want you to watch me, Roslyn.

58:37.080 --> 58:41.080
- But why are you doing it?
- l put in for it. l entered.

58:41.200 --> 58:43.160
- Stop him!
- How can l?

58:43.280 --> 58:45.960
They don't mind getting busted up.

58:49.200 --> 58:51.720
- Perce!
- You don't know what you're saying!

58:51.840 --> 58:53.600
Perce, here's your prize!

58:53.720 --> 58:56.160
- OK, boy, you want it?
- Hell, yes!

58:56.520 --> 59:01.160
We still have some real men in the West.
Back again, this time on a Brahma bull,...

59:01.280 --> 59:05.480
..the cowboy from Black Hills, Colorado,
Perce Howland.

59:05.600 --> 59:07.520
(crowd cheers)

59:21.960 --> 59:24.160
(screams from crowd)

59:36.400 --> 59:39.760
Come on, honey.
We're gonna have some drinks.

59:40.240 --> 59:42.320
ls he unconscious still?

59:42.440 --> 59:47.720
Probably, but it ain't noticeable. He's
arguing with the judge about who won.

59:48.480 --> 59:50.720
You still mad at me?

59:50.840 --> 59:52.800
l don't understand.

59:52.920 --> 59:57.360
People dying, and people just
standing around. Don't you care?

59:57.480 --> 01:00:00.560
l just went in for that boy
with a wild bull runnin' loose.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:04.440
- l'm lucky to be sittin' here myself!
- You did? You did?

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.120
Well, l just thought l could get him out,
so l did, that's all.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.520
But what if he'd died? lt would be terrible!

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:15.520
Honey, we all gotta go sometime.
Dyin' is as natural as livin'.

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:20.000
- A man afraid to die is afraid to live.
- Roz? Did you see me?

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:23.680
You were wonderful. Get in the back.
We're taking you to a hospital.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:27.320
- Oh, no. We're gonna have some fun.
- Yeah, sure. Come on.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.760
- How do you feel?
- How do l feel?

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:33.280
Like l was kicked by a bull.
He was somethin', wasn't he?

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:37.080
Oh, l want no part of that bull,
except on a plate, medium rare.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.280
- Come on.
- ls he all right?

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:44.280
Sure. ln two weeks he won't
remember this. Or you, either.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.360
Why don't you give your sympathy
where it's appreciated?

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.840
Where's that?

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.600
Hey, you guys, come on!

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.360
l feel funny. l feel like...

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:05.600
What was in the injection that man
gave to me? l... l see the prettiest stars.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:09.240
l never seen stars before.
You ever see stars before, Gay?

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:13.200
lt's like that bull had
the whole Milky Way in its hoof.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:17.280
Hey, Bill? Bill?
Whiskey for eight people, huh?

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:23.600
Hey, was that you
crying in the ambulance?

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:27.280
- Was that her, Gay?
- Sure was.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.720
l certainly want to thank you.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:36.800
Oh, now... Here's to my buddy -
old, elderly Gay.

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.480
Gay's not old.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:44.960
And to old, elderly Pilot
and his five-dollar, elderly airplane.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.760
And... to my friend Roslyn.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.280
- Well, we're all buddies now, right?
- That's right.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.400
Then what are you lookin'
so mad at me for, buddy?

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.360
Hey...

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:05.240
Uh, is it all right
if we have this dance together?

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:11.360
Sure. Roslyn, why don't you
dance with Perce?

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.000
OK.

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.080
Nothin' like being young, is there, Gay?

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.480
No, that's right.

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:45.480
But you know what they say. There's
some keeps gettin' younger all the time.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.960
What's eatin' you?

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.880
Just my life.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.360
This is the way my father used to do it.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.240
Oh!

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.680
- What's the matter?
- lt's all right.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.480
Come on, let's go out and see the world.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.040
l... better sit down.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.120
- Do you mind?
- No.

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.200
Damn that bull.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.560
Don't say anything. Just be still.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.680
Gay's a pretty great fella, isn't he?

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.760
Yes.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:11.080
You know, l can't figure you,
floatin' around out here like this.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.440
You belong to Gay?

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:17.080
l don't know where l belong.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:21.840
l don't like to see the way
they grind up women out here.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:26.120
Although l guess
a lot of them don't mind, do they?

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.200
Some do.

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:31.680
Don't you let them grind you up. Hear?

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.960
How come you got
such trust in your eyes?

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.680
- l do?
- Like you was just born.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:42.080
- Oh, no.
- Was you really cryin' for me before?

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.080
You were hurt. Didn't anyone
ever cry for you before?

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.880
No. No stranger.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:58.240
Last... April 1 2th, l was kicked so bad,
l was out all day and all night.

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:03.280
And l was with my girlfriend
and my two buddies.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:07.200
l haven't seen her
and l haven't seen them since.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.760
They left you? Alone?

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.760
Can l ask you something?

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:24.440
l mean, l don't have anybody, uh... you
know what l mean, that l could talk to.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:28.800
And l don't know how you should do...

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.840
What do you mean?

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:36.800
Well, see, this is the first year
that l've been floatin' around.

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:40.920
l'm not like Gay and Pilot.
l got a pretty good home.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:44.000
l mean, l had a good home.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.080
One day...

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.800
..my father, we was out back, and...

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:56.160
..boom, like that, it happened.
Down he went.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.280
Some damn fool hunters.

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:04.320
- They killed him?
- Mm-hm.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.080
And then she changed.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.760
- Who is ''she''?
- My mother.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:18.320
She used... She used to be so dignified.
She'd walk next to him like a saint.

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:27.080
Well, pretty soon this man
starts comin' around, and...

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.200
Well, she changed.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.560
Three months, they got married. Well, OK.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:41.400
But l said to her ''Ma, look. You better
get a paper from this Mr Blackwell,...

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:46.200
..because l'm the oldest, and you know
Papa wanted me to have this ranch.''

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.480
So you know what happens?

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:53.120
On their wedding night
he turns around and offers me wages.

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.720
On my father's place.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:59.520
What did she say?

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.600
Say?

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.920
l don't think she heard.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:09.720
lt's like she hardly
remembers me any more.

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:16.560
l don't know. lt's hard to explain.
lt's like she's changed altogether.

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:25.680
So what l want to know... What l want to
know is... who do you depend on? Who?

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.600
l don't know.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:33.440
Maybe all there really is
is just the next thing.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.360
The next thing that happens.

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:41.080
Maybe you're not supposed to
remember anybody's promises.

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.440
You could count on mine.
l trust you, Roslyn.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.080
- l think l love you.
- Oh, no. You don't know me.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:50.960
l don't care. Roz... Oh!

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.760
That damn bull!

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.360
Roslyn? Roslyn?

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:01.840
Here we are.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.240
Come on now.
l want you to meet my kids.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:12.240
- Your kids are here?
- Yeah. They come to the rodeo.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.040
l ain't seen 'em in a year.

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:20.399
Oh, you ought to see the welcome
they give me - nearly knocked me over!

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:24.399
- That great?
- l'm so glad for you, Gay.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:31.520
She's gonna be 19. She got so pretty.

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:37.000
They just happen to be here for the rodeo.
Both of 'em. That great?

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.880
Where are they?

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.479
Where are who?

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:49.680
My kids. l told 'em l'd be back in a minute.
You heard me tell 'em.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:52.080
They went outside.

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.520
Outside.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:06.680
Gaylord! Gaylord!

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.880
Rosemary! Gaylord!

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:16.240
- Gaylord!
- Gaylord! Here's your father!

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:19.359
Gaylord! l know you hear me!

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:24.080
Where you gone to?
l told you l'd be right back!

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:28.279
- You come here now!
- You'll probably find him at home.

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:31.960
Gaylord! You come here now!

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.439
l know you hear me!

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:39.439
Rosemary! l know you hear me!
You come here now!

01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:42.680
(Roslyn screams)

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:50.319
Oh, Gay! They'll be looking for you,
l'm sure. They probably thought you left.

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:53.040
Oh, poor Gay! Poor Gay!

01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:00.920
Aren't you going too fast? Please, huh?

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:07.520
Don't worry, kid.
l never kill anybody l know.

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:12.920
A fella smashed up my best girlfriend.
She was beautiful, with black hair.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.360
Please, Guido.

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:18.080
Say... Say hello to me, Roslyn.

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.920
Hello, Guido. Please, huh?

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:28.080
We're all blind bombardiers, Roslyn.
We kill people we never even saw.

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:30.880
l bombed nine cities.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.400
l sure must've broken a lot of dishes,
but l never saw them.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:38.960
You know, think of all the puppy dogs
and mail carriers...

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.880
..and eyeglasses that must've gone up.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.320
Boy, you know, droppin' a bomb
is like tellin' a lie.

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:49.040
Makes everything so quiet.

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.520
Pretty soon you don't hear anything,
you don't see anything.

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.960
Not even your wife.

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:59.880
Now the difference is that l see you.
You're the first one l ever really saw.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.280
Please, Guido, don't kill us!

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:06.080
How do you get to know somebody, kid?

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:11.120
l can't make a landing,
and l can't get up to God, either.

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.200
Help me.

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.520
l never said ''help me'' in my life.

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:23.520
l don't know anybody.
So how do l land, honey?

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:27.480
Will you give me a little time? Say yes.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:33.640
At least say ''Hello, Guido.''

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.760
Yes, Guido. Hello, Guido.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.920
Hello, Roslyn.

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:22.240
Huh? Huh?

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:26.080
OK. OK. l'll drive.

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:30.280
- Gay, we're here.
- Where?

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.400
Huh? OK.

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.040
Guido, l'm so sorry. Guido?

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:51.280
l'm sorry.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:54.080
Won't you hurt your hand? lt's so dark.

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:57.400
Guido, look how dark it is. lt's all dark.

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:02.640
Hey! Hey! What in the hell
are you stompin' the flowers for?

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.400
You busted all the damn heliotropes!

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:12.200
Look at that. Look at that now.
What in the hell good is that?

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:18.280
- He's just trying to fix the house.
- What call has he got to fix the house?

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:21.360
- He's only trying to say hello.
- Hello.

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:24.200
(Perce) What's goin' on?
Who's doin' that?

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:27.680
Hey, who's done this? Who done this?

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.280
- Don't take it off!
- Take it off me! What is it?

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:35.480
- Don't take it off.
- Take it off! What is it?

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:38.320
lt's your bandage. Stop tangling it.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:41.960
- Bandage? What for, a bandage?
- For your head.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.800
- Who tied this on me?
- The ambulance did.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:51.240
You leave me at a disadvantage all night?

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:55.080
- No.
- Huh? Was it you, Gay?

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:58.840
Was it you, Gay?

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:02.680
(Roslyn) Oh!

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.800
- Who did that?
- Gay, come over here.

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:09.200
- You leave me at a disadvantage?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.520
Who did that to me?

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:16.280
Where are we? Where are you goin'?
Leave me alone.

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:21.480
Where are we goin'?
What is this blasted place?

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.520
What is this place? Where are we?

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:29.160
This is my house. Or it's Guido's.
Well, it's a house, anyway.

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.800
No. No, Ma, Ma, don't, don't.

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.600
Gay?

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:02.200
Come on, Gay.

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:05.840
l wish you'd met Gaylord and Rosemary.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.240
lf l had a new kid
l'd know just how to be with him.

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:15.240
Just how to do...

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.520
Oh, l wasted those kids.
l didn't know nothin'.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.800
No. l'm sure they love you, Gay.

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:28.560
Would you ever want a kid... with me?

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:32.160
Let me turn off the light in the car.
You get some sleep.

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:35.280
l don't wanna sleep.
l asked you a question.

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:38.840
Did l ask you to turn
the lights out in the car?

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.760
What are you runnin' away from
all the time?

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:45.520
l wouldn't wash the windows
for my wife, even.

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:50.320
Painted the fireplace,
planted them damn heliotropes...

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:56.080
What are they doin' here? What do you
keep bringin' them around for?

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:58.920
- Gay, l didn't bring 'em here.
- Where are you at?

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:02.080
l don't know where you're at.

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:05.200
Gay, l'm with you. l'm here with you.

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:14.000
What if someday suddenly you turn
around and you don't like me any more?

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:19.240
Like before, when Perce got hurt,
you started to give me a look.

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:24.600
l know that look, and it scares me, Gay.
l couldn't be with strangers any more.

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:29.880
Honey, honey! l got a little mad, that's all.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.440
That don't mean l didn't like you.

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:38.560
Didn't your papa ever spank you, then
pick you up and give you a big kiss?

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:40.920
He did, didn't he?

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:46.120
He was never there long enough.
And strangers spanked me for keeps.

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.720
Oh, Gay! Love me, love me!

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:01.000
We made up now. OK?

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.960
Yeah, OK. OK.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.640
Let's get some sleep.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:13.760
Yeah. Yeah, we'll make out.

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:18.040
l'll farm. Run some cattle maybe.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:23.600
l'm a pretty good man, Roslyn.
Best man you'll ever see.

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:26.400
l'll show you tomorrow,
up in the mountains.

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:31.360
Not many can keep up with old Gay.
You wait and see.

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.840
Help.

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:58.040
- Why is the dog shivering?
- He'll do that up here.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.720
(airplane)

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:24.920
That star... That star is so far away...

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:30.120
..that by the time the light from it
reaches us here on Earth,...

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.960
..it might not even be up there any more.

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:35.840
Boy, you sure know a lot, don't you, Pilot?

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:40.000
Astronomy is in all the library books,
Perce. Nothin' to it but readin'.

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:44.000
- Still, it's wonderful to know things.
- Knowin' things don't matter much.

01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:47.400
- You got somethin' a lot more important.
- What?

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.480
You care.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:53.120
Whatever happens to anybody,
it happens to you.

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:56.960
You're really hooked into the whole thing,
Roslyn. lt's a blessing.

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.320
People say l'm just nervous.

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:04.560
lf it weren't for the nervous people in the
world, we'd all still be eating each other.

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:07.080
l don't know about
you educated people,...

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:11.480
..but us ignorant folk
gotta hit the sack.

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:21.800
- Why is the dog trembling?
- Got a whiff of the horses, l guess.

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:25.240
- They must be close by, Guido.
- Baby... Baby...

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.240
(dog snaps)

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:30.720
- Keep quiet, you fool!
- Oh, don't, Gay. He couldn't help it.

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:36.040
- Have the horses ever kicked him?
- lt's not the horses he's afraid of. lt's us.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:40.160
What are you talkin' about? l never
mistreated that dog, and you know it.

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:44.760
lt's only common sense, Gay.
He knows there's wild animals up there.

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:47.840
Dogs were wild too, once.
He's just remembering when.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:51.640
He's been up here enough times
to know what will happen.

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:55.280
He's just scared
he's gonna end up dead too.

01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:00.720
Uh, come on, honey. Keep yourself
nice and warm here by the fire.

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:05.560
You kill them?

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:10.760
No, no. We, uh... sell 'em to the dealer.

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:14.040
He kills them?

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:19.320
Well, they're chicken-feed horses.
You know, turn 'em into dog food.

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:22.720
Like you buy in the store
for the dog and the cat.

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:28.680
Well, l thought you knew that.
Everybody knows that.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:37.000
Maybe you better sleep on the truck, in
case something comes crawlin' around.

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:59.000
Get some sleep now. Come on.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.000
Honey...

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:17.480
Honey, l just round 'em up
and sell 'em to the dealer. Always have.

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:23.440
There's no need to look at me that way.
You're lookin' at me like l was a stranger.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:25.360
Honey!

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:28.000
l thought they were used
for riding, or for...

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.240
Well, sure, they used to be.

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:35.760
Well, like Christmas presents for kids,
cos they're small horses, you see?

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:38.640
But kids ride motor scooters now.

01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:44.000
They're real strong horses, though.
Little as they are.

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:48.560
They bred to 'em for stamina. Mustang
blood pulled all the ploughs in the West.

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:53.240
They couldn't have settled here unless
somebody caught mustang for 'em.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.600
Somehow it all got changed around.

01:22:55.720 --> 01:23:01.040
l'm doin' the same thing l always did.
lt's just that they changed it around.

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:04.840
But you know what you're doing
isn't right, don't you?

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:09.360
- lf l didn't do it, somebody else would.
- l don't care about the others.

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:12.360
You've bought food for my dog.
What did you think was in it?

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.680
- l don't wanna hear it.
- Nothin' can live unless somethin' dies.

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:17.760
Oh, stop!

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:20.920
Roslyn, we never kidded, you and l.

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.840
Now, l don't want to lose you.

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:29.000
But you gotta help me a bit, cos l can't put
on that this is all as bad as you make it.

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.440
All l know is everything else is wages.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:35.200
l hunt these horses to keep myself free.
So l'm a free man.

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:37.920
That's why you liked me, isn't it?

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:42.160
- l liked you because you were kind.
- l haven't changed.

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:44.280
Yes. This changes it.

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:47.160
Honey, a kind man can kill.

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:49.480
No. He can't.

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:53.960
Well, maybe you have to take
the bad with the good,...

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:57.240
..else you'll be runnin'
for the rest of your life.

01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:02.160
What is there to stop for?
You're just like everybody else.

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:06.240
Yeah, sure. Maybe we're all alike.
lncludin' you.

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:12.440
We start out doin' somethin', meanin'
no harm, somethin' naturally in us to do.

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:16.880
But somewhere along the line it gets
changed around into somethin' bad.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.280
Like dancin' in a nightclub.

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:21.640
You started out just wantin' to dance.

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:26.320
But little by little it turns out that people
ain't interested in how good you danced.

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:29.880
They're gawkin' at you with
somethin' different in their minds.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.080
And they turn it sour, don't they? l could
have looked down my nose at you too.

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:39.120
Showin' yourself off in a nightclub
for so much a night.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:43.000
But l took my hat off to you,
cos l know the difference.

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:48.360
This... This is how l dance, Roslyn. And
if they make somethin' else out of it,...

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:52.200
..well, l can't run the world,
any more than you could.

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:59.040
You took your hat off to me?

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.680
You mean that, don't you, Gay?

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.360
Good night.

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:36.320
Shame on you, you old fool.

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:45.800
l can fly her back in the morning,
if you want me to.

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:50.360
l was wonderin' how
she agreed to come out here.

01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:53.240
She's got a lot of right,
when you think about it.

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:56.360
lt don't make too much sense
for 1 5 horses.

01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:00.960
Don't worry yourselves about her.
She's comin' along fine.

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:09.680
You be quiet now.
Everybody's showin' off.

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:42.800
OK, OK, Perce. Hold it, hold it.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:47.200
Come on, Perce, give me a hand here.

01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:50.880
Look, Gay. He's not snapping any more.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Yeah, things generally
look different in the morning.

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.880
Try and chase 'em
down the old mine road.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
OK, Gay, l'm ready.

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.600
How do you want her?

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.680
That way.

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:38.360
Boy, that's some jacket.
Pretty breezy, though, isn't it?

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:44.520
Been on a lot of missions in this thing.
l wouldn't take $100 for it. lt's bulletproof.

01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:48.520
l wish you were comin' along with me.
You'd see some real flyin'.

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:53.440
Probably never see this again
in history, you know.

01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:59.720
- OK, Gay.
- Switch off?

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:02.360
Throttle closed, switch off.

01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:07.880
Turn your partner, boy. Do-si-do.

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:11.920
- Once more, con amore!
- Here we go.

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.320
Contact.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.400
That lousy car gas! All right, try it again.

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:24.040
Contact.

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.960
lt's like a dream.

01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:45.240
l seen a picture of the moon once.
Looked just like this.

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:48.560
- You want up?
- Yes.

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:54.560
- He'll drive the horses out of that pass.
- Who owns this land?

01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:58.120
Government, probably.
Might as well call it God's country.

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:00.280
- You see anything?
- Uh-uh.

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:04.960
How quiet it is. You can hear
your skin against your clothes.

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:10.320
You're lookin' real good, honey. What
do you say we go into Reno tonight?

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:11.640
OK.

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:16.520
l forgot to tell you something last night.
Cow outfits use the pasture up here.

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:19.520
They shoot mustang
and leave 'em for the buzzards.

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:22.960
Cos they eat all the good feed.
You know that, don't you, Perce?

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:25.960
- Huh? Yeah, l know that.
- Why didn't you say so?

01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:28.040
l just said so.

01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:32.120
They're nothin' but misfit horses.
l wish you'd been here in the old days.

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:35.600
l seen 'em pour out of those passes
400, 500 at a time.

01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:38.680
We'd build a corral and funnel 'em into it.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:43.800
Some of 'em were real beautiful animals.
Made sweet ridin' horses.

01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:47.080
- l wish l'd been here then.
- l hear something.

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:49.600
- What?
- Engine, sounds like.

01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:51.880
- Where?
- Out there.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.600
No, it's too soon.
He wouldn't be in the pass yet.

01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:57.520
- Listen. l hear him.
- There he is!

01:32:57.640 --> 01:32:59.600
Gay, look!

01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:04.520
l'd have seen him,
but l didn't expect him so soon.

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:08.120
Oh, l seen him glinting against the sun.
That's what it was.

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:10.200
- (gunshot)
- What's that?

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:14.280
He fired a shot.
Hey, you got good eyes, old boy.

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:16.640
Uh-oh. Here they come.

01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:20.720
One, two, three, four, five, six...

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:25.720
- l guess he'll go back for the rest now.
- Let me have a look.

01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:29.840
- You see the rest yet?
- No.

01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:34.120
Six. lt looks like a stallion and four mares.

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:38.240
- And a little colt.
- You sure?

01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:40.720
Yeah. A spring foal.

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:45.280
Yeah. lt's a colt all right, Gay.

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.880
Want a look?

01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:00.200
Maybe it's cooler in the truck.

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:06.920
lt's all right. She's gonna make it.

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:09.440
You said there'd be fifteen.
There are only six.

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:12.120
Ah, probably lost a few. That'll happen.

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:14.680
lt don't make much sense for six, does it?

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:17.800
Six is six. Better than wages, ain't it?

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:24.400
- l said it's better than wages, ain't it?
- Sure. Anything's better than wages.

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:30.920
Perce, l know a place about 100 miles
northeast, Thighbone Mountain.

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:34.040
Must be at least 500 head in there.

01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:38.240
l never bothered with 'em cos it's tough
to get 'em out. You have to horseback in.

01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:43.520
l don't know, Gay. To tell you the truth,
l don't even know about rodeos any more.

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:46.800
Boy, l'm beginnin'
to smell wages all over you.

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:49.920
Sure wish my old man hadn't died.

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:53.120
When you get through wishin',
all there is is a man's work.

01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:55.440
And there ain't much of that left.

01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:58.400
Come on, give me a hand with this drum.

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:22.400
Come on, Perce, let's get these stakes in.

01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:05.360
Come on, Dooley.
Come on, dog. Here, Dooley.

01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:24.120
Come on, Perce.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.200
Let's go, boy!

01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:58.240
You grab hold now.
We're gonna do a lot of fast turning.

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:22.760
Throw again, Perce!

01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:28.760
Get that horse, cowboy.

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:33.440
That's the way!

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:54.800
Attaboy, Gay!

01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:23.120
Get that horse!

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:50.120
Attaboy, Gay!

01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:57.040
- Well, here's the big chief.
- What?

01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:59.000
The stallion.

01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:18.520
Get that horse, cowboy.

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:21.840
That's the way.

01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:33.320
We'll tie 'em up now, and open their
nooses so they won't choke overnight.

01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:37.320
- Overnight?
- The dealer'll pick 'em up in the morning.

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:55.320
Perce?

01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:00.320
- Were those his mares?
- Uh-huh.

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:02.560
Was that his colt?

01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:07.680
Perce, get in here.

01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:27.680
- Gay, why are you killing him?
- Stand aside, honey.

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:32.920
- OK, you won! All right, you've won!
- Let go of that rope! Get outta here!

01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:36.520
- Gay, darling...
- Pull him! Choke him down, Guido!

01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:39.640
- Get off me, Roslyn.
- Stop it!

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:44.320
- Roslyn!
- Shut up and pull that horse down!

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:47.760
Come on! One, two... Go!

01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:34.760
Well, l guess comin' up here
for the first time like her,...

01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:38.360
..there might not seem much sense to it,
for only five horses.

01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:41.080
Not knowin' how it used to be.

01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:46.640
l never thought of it, but l guess
the fewer you kill, the worse it looks.

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:52.320
What do you say
we give her these horses?

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:59.200
How much do you want for 'em? l'll pay
you. l'll give you $200. ls that enough?

01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:12.200
- Let's get in the truck.
- Gay, you was about to give 'em to her.

01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:16.880
l did think of it, but l sell to dealers only.
Cos all they're lookin' to buy is a horse.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.680
- l didn't mean to insult you, Gay.
- No insult.

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:24.080
l'm just wonderin' who you think
you've been talkin' to since we met.

01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:51.760
Brother, what a day.

01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:56.560
l nearly hit a mountain back there.
Cylinder cut out at the bottom of a dive.

01:43:56.680 --> 01:43:58.680
Squirtin' oil.

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:01.960
Boy, that's the closest
l ever come, l tell ya.

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:06.360
Listen, do you want me to stop this?

01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:11.880
l know how you feel, Roslyn.
l never liked this part myself.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.600
Truthfully, the only part
l enjoyed is the flying.

01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:18.520
You want me to stop it?

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:22.480
- You would?
- You're through with Gay now, right?

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:28.680
Well, tell me. He doesn't know what
you're all about. He'll never know.

01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:34.640
Tell me, Roslyn. l been waitin'.
l'm goin' out of my mind with waitin'.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:41.240
Come back with me. Give me a week,
two weeks. Let me show you what l am.

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:45.640
Tell me, Roslyn.
Give me a reason and l'll stop it.

01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:49.600
There'll be hell to pay,
but give me a reason and l'll do it.

01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:55.720
A reason? You, a sensitive fellow.
So sad for his wife.

01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:59.560
Crying about the bombs you dropped
and the people you killed.

01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:02.360
You have to get something to be human?

01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:07.520
You never felt anything for anybody in
your life. All you know is the sad words.

01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:12.640
You could blow up the world,
and all you'd feel is sorry for yourself!

01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:44.520
- She's an old one.
- Fifteen if she's a day.

01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:47.320
She wouldn't last through the winter.

01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:27.160
We'll tie down the other three
on the way back.

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:31.160
- What do you think this mare'll weigh?
- About 600 pounds, l guess.

01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:35.440
- Must be about 400 on that brown, huh?
- Just about, yeah.

01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:38.280
Must be about 800 on the stallion.

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:43.080
- A little lighter. About 1900, 2000 pounds.
- How does that all come out?

01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:46.960
Well, six cents a pound,
be about $1 10, $1 20.

01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:50.160
- How do you wanna cut it up?
- Any way you like.

01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:53.480
- l'll take 50 for myself and the plane.
- OK.

01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:56.840
l ought to have about 40
for the truck and me.

01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:00.280
That leaves 25 for you, Perce.
That all right?

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:02.160
Perce!

01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:07.200
No. You fellas take it.
l just came along for the ride anyway.

01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:09.120
Horse killers!

01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:11.880
Killers! Murderers!

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:15.480
You're liars! All of you, liars!

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:19.600
You're only happy
when you can see something die!

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:22.560
Why don't you kill yourselves
and be happy?!

01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:25.600
You and your God's country! Freedom!

01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:31.080
l pity you! You're three
dear, sweet, dead men!

01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:37.160
She's crazy. They're all crazy.

01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:42.480
You try not to believe it because
you need them. She's crazy.

01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:48.200
You struggle, you build, you try,
you turn yourself inside out for 'em.

01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:52.080
But it's never enough.
So they put the spurs to you.

01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:56.360
l know. l got the marks.
l know this racket.

01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:01.480
- l just forgot what l knew for a little while.
- Butchers! Murderers!

01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:05.160
l pity you! You're three dead men!

01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:28.720
Hold this light for me, will you?

01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:42.960
Buck up, boy. Before you know it
you'll be up to your neck in dames again.

01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:46.920
l just been thinkin'.
l don't know how we got so stupid.

01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:50.080
The world is full of mountains.

01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:56.440
Montana, Colorado, Canada, even Mexico.
Where there's mountains, there's horses.

01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:00.200
Probably we could clean 'em all out
till we're too weak to walk.

01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:04.440
We'd work a while and...
l could even sell my house.

01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:07.360
l don't know what l've been
keepin' it for anyway.

01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:11.760
Put everything into a good plane.
We'll get this thing on a business basis.

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:15.440
For instance, we ought to water
those horses before we weigh 'em in.

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:18.560
Put 50 pounds on just these five
if we let 'em drink.

01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:21.800
- We just been foolin' around.
- l wanna get out of here. Come on.

01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:25.480
No. With a good plane you could
fly into Reno from anywhere.

01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:29.520
Check into the Mapes,
have a good time, and off we go again.

01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:32.040
Boy, we wouldn't need anybody.
l tell you...

01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:35.880
Why don't you shut up, Guido?
Just shut up, huh?

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:01.080
- Do you want me to turn 'em loose?
- No. There'd just be a fight.

01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:19.760
l'll meet you at the dealer's.
We'll get his winch truck.

01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:23.320
Don't spin the prop till l check the switch.

01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:37.560
- Switch off?
- Switch off. Throttle closed.

01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:44.320
- Contact.
- (engine starts)

01:50:57.320 --> 01:50:59.280
Gay!

01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:58.920
Go home. Go.

01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:47.200
Help him, Perce.

01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:57.640
He don't want no help.

01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:23.640
Gay?

01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:35.760
You held him.
l'm proud of ya, boy. You held him.

01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:40.960
We'll get them all back tomorrow. Just get
your wind back now. Get your wind back.

01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:45.400
Don't worry, we're not through here.
We're only gettin' started.

01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:49.920
We don't need anybody in the world.
You know that now, don't you?

01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:58.720
What are you doin'?

01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:13.680
What in the hell you catch him for?

01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:19.320
Don't want nobody makin' up
my mind for me, that's all.

01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:22.960
Damn 'em all!

01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:28.640
They changed it. Changed it all around.
Smeared it all over with blood.

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:33.200
Well, l'm finished with it.

01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:38.000
lt's... lt's like ropin' a dream now.

01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:44.400
Just gotta find another way
to be alive, that's all.

01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:46.840
lf there is one any more.

01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:53.400
Perce, cut that mare loose
for me, will you?

01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:55.480
Sure.

01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:04.200
Drive you back, if you want.

01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:16.840
Um, l'm pleased to have met you, Roslyn.

01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:21.120
Don't get hurt any more, will you, Perce?

01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:31.400
- See you around, Guido.
- Where'll you be? Polishin' windshields?

01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:33.600
Makin' change in a supermarket?

01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:38.520
Try the Laundromat! They need a fella
there to load the machines!

01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:40.160
Gay!

01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:57.600
l'll leave tomorrow. OK?

01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:33.520
l bless you, girl.

01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:59.000
Gay, if there could be
one person in the world,...

01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:03.320
..a child who could be brave
from the beginning...

01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:08.080
l was scared to when you asked me.
But l'm not so much now. Are you?

01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:11.000
No.

01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:16.120
How do you find
your way back in the dark?

01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:20.600
Just head for that big star straight on.

01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:23.360
The highway's under it.

01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:26.480
lt'll take us right home.
