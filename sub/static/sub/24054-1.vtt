WEBVTT

01:05.273 --> 01:06.441
What did you eat?

01:08.485 --> 01:10.236
You had rations for two weeks.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.280
You were inside for nearly four months.

01:13.281 --> 01:14.741
I don't remember eating.

01:17.952 --> 01:19.913
How long did you think you were inside?

01:22.415 --> 01:23.249
Days.

01:24.667 --> 01:25.794
Maybe weeks.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.466
What happened to Josie Radek?

01:40.433 --> 01:42.268
-I don't know.

01:43.436 --> 01:44.270
Thorensen? Dead.

01:49.776 --> 01:50.693
Ventress?

01:56.074 --> 01:56.950
I don't know.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.161
Then what do you know?

02:57.552 --> 02:59.554
This is a cell.

03:00.597 --> 03:04.475
Like all cells,
it is born from an existing cell.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.394
And by extension,

03:06.853 --> 03:09.856
all cells were ultimately born
from one cell.

03:10.857 --> 03:14.319
A single organism alone on planet Earth,

03:14.402 --> 03:16.070
perhaps alone in the universe.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.531
About four billion years ago...

03:19.824 --> 03:21.951
one became two, two became four.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.914
Then eight, 16, 32.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.917
The rhythm of the dividing pair...

03:30.043 --> 03:34.464
which becomes the structure
of every microbe,

03:34.547 --> 03:37.300
blade of grass, sea creature,
land creature...

03:38.009 --> 03:38.885
and human.

03:39.302 --> 03:42.013
The structure of everything that lives...

03:42.931 --> 03:45.308
and everything that dies.

03:45.892 --> 03:49.437
As students of medicine,
as the doctors of tomorrow,

03:49.604 --> 03:50.939
this is where you come in.

03:52.023 --> 03:55.735
The cell we're looking at is from a tumor.

03:55.985 --> 03:59.405
Female patient, early 30s,
taken from the cervix.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.199
Over the course of the next term,

04:01.282 --> 04:04.118
we will be closely examining cancer cells
in vitro

04:04.202 --> 04:06.162
and discussing autophagic activity.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.207
Hey, Katie.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.417
I read the John Sulston paper
last night.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.294
I still feel like
I'm not working hard enough.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.921
I'm behind the other students.

04:15.004 --> 04:17.674
-They find everything easier.
You aren't, and they don't.

04:17.757 --> 04:18.800
-Lena!

04:21.135 --> 04:21.970
Dan.

04:22.804 --> 04:25.682
I've been looking for you at lunch,
but you never seem to be around.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.017
I've been catching up on some writing.

04:28.101 --> 04:31.312
All work and no play, it sounds...
not healthy.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.857
I wanted to ask,

04:35.233 --> 04:37.318
Sarah and I have a few people over.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.906
A garden party while the weather holds.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.201
Actually, I do have plans.

04:45.660 --> 04:46.828
I think it'll be fun.

04:46.911 --> 04:50.373
Thanks, Dan, I really appreciate it,
but I'm going to paint our bedr--

04:50.790 --> 04:51.624
The bedroom.

04:54.836 --> 04:55.920
It's been a year, Lena.

04:59.173 --> 05:02.343
You're allowed to come to a barbecue.
It is not a betrayal

05:02.927 --> 05:04.595
or an insult to his memory.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.142
I'm gonna paint the bedroom.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.690

07:48.718 --> 07:50.636
No one knew anything about your unit.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.138
I contacted everyone.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.764
Everyone I could.

07:54.390 --> 07:56.642
The other partners knew
just as little as me.

08:02.273 --> 08:03.357
Was it covert?

08:05.735 --> 08:07.445
Mm... Maybe.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.198
What does that mean, "maybe"?

08:12.492 --> 08:15.286
Okay, yeah, it was covert.
Yeah, I think so.

08:15.745 --> 08:16.913
Pakistan again?

08:18.998 --> 08:23.085
I-- I don't know where it was, or...

08:25.755 --> 08:26.589
what it was.

08:26.672 --> 08:30.134
How is that possible?
Was it warm?

08:31.135 --> 08:31.969
Was there snow?

08:32.512 --> 08:37.016
Did the people there speak Portuguese,
or Swahili, or Pashto?

08:41.729 --> 08:43.272
How long have you been back?

08:44.357 --> 08:45.233
I don't know.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.693
How'd you get back?
What base did you fly into?

08:49.612 --> 08:52.740
-I don't know.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.828
You must be able to tell me something.

08:58.871 --> 09:01.541
You vanished off the face of the earth
for 12 months.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.252
I deserve a better explanation
than no explanation.

09:04.335 --> 09:05.419
Does it matter?

09:28.526 --> 09:29.527
Kane...

09:31.070 --> 09:32.488
how did you get home?

09:33.948 --> 09:34.782
Hmm?

09:36.409 --> 09:37.535
I was outside.

09:39.161 --> 09:40.413
Outside the house?

09:41.872 --> 09:42.707
No.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.167
No, I was outside the room.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.297
The room with the bed.

09:51.215 --> 09:52.758
The door was open, and...

09:54.802 --> 09:55.845
I saw you.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.517
I recognized you.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.731
Your face.

10:21.537 --> 10:22.955
I don't feel very well.

10:31.922 --> 10:33.007
Stay with me, baby.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.343
-I'm right here with you.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.845
Male, 31, hemorrhage, in seizure.

10:37.928 --> 10:40.348
Stay with me, baby. I love you.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.850
Baby, look at me. Can you do something?!

10:46.646 --> 10:48.230
You call for a police escort?

10:58.199 --> 10:59.617
Hey, easy, easy!

11:12.380 --> 11:13.631
Out of the truck, now!

11:13.714 --> 11:15.633
What are you doing?

11:15.716 --> 11:17.343
Out!
Don't shoot!

11:17.426 --> 11:18.844
Out! Move!

11:18.928 --> 11:20.179
Out, out, out!

11:20.262 --> 11:21.430
What's going on?

11:22.223 --> 11:24.308
What are you doing?
You can't move him!

11:24.392 --> 11:27.019
Let him go! Let him go!

11:29.647 --> 11:31.023
Let him go!

12:31.167 --> 12:32.668
You must be feeling dreadful.

12:33.502 --> 12:36.338
It's a hangover
from the sedative you were given.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.215
Come on, sit down.

12:42.928 --> 12:43.763
Who are you?

12:54.106 --> 12:55.816
My name is Dr. Ventress.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.194
I'm a psychologist.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.030
Why am I talking to a psychologist?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.075
Am I in a psychiatric hospital?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.203
-No.
Then what?

13:07.912 --> 13:08.871
Where am I?

13:10.289 --> 13:11.540
Where's my husband?

13:12.291 --> 13:14.502
You served in the military
for seven years.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.839
I'm a professor from Johns Hopkins.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.425
I want to know what the fuck
I'm doing here.

13:21.509 --> 13:26.055
Your research area is the genetically
programmed life cycle of a cell.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.556
Where is my husband?

13:27.640 --> 13:30.601
Yeah,
I'd like to talk about Sergeant Kane.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.979
When did he arrive back home?

13:36.774 --> 13:39.527
-I want to see a lawyer.
-You're not gonna be able to.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.534
Did he explain how he got back?

13:48.452 --> 13:51.121
-No.
-Did he contact you at any point

13:51.205 --> 13:52.289
while he was away?

13:52.915 --> 13:53.833
No.

13:55.125 --> 13:58.003
What did he tell you
about his mission when he returned?

13:59.046 --> 14:00.923
-Nothing.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.884
Did he ever mention where he was going,
what he was doing?

14:04.260 --> 14:05.761
He never said, I never asked.

14:05.845 --> 14:10.558
But you made regular requests
for information from his unit CO.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.894
Until six months ago,
and then you stopped.

14:16.730 --> 14:19.275
Why was that

14:19.692 --> 14:20.818
Time to move on?

14:22.278 --> 14:24.488
It's not easy to move on.

14:26.448 --> 14:27.408
I didn't.

14:34.915 --> 14:37.835
I'm done answering questions.
It's your turn.

14:39.503 --> 14:40.921
Your husband's here.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.258
He's extremely ill.

14:44.341 --> 14:47.177
Multiple organ failure.

14:48.929 --> 14:50.431
Massive internal bleeding.

14:51.473 --> 14:55.102
He must have been exposed
to some sort of radiation,

14:55.728 --> 14:57.354
some kind of virus.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.399
You have to tell me where he was,
what he was doing.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.362
I could actually help him.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.492
<i>A religious event.</i>

15:52.451 --> 15:54.578
<i>An extraterrestrial event.</i>

15:55.663 --> 15:57.164
<i>A higher dimension.</i>

15:57.957 --> 15:59.667
We have many theories,

16:00.084 --> 16:01.251
few facts.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.463
It started around three years ago.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.550
Blackwater National Park reported
that a lighthouse was surrounded

16:08.634 --> 16:11.303
by something they termed "a shimmer."

16:11.971 --> 16:15.516
One of the wardens went in to investigate.

16:16.767 --> 16:17.601
Never returned.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.396
The event was classified.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.440
Since then, we've approached by land,
by sea,

16:23.524 --> 16:26.902
sent in drones, animals,
and teams of people.

16:27.903 --> 16:29.446
But nothing comes back.

16:30.406 --> 16:32.950
And the boundary's getting bigger.
It's expanding.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.744
So far, it's eating
into barely populated swampland,

16:35.828 --> 16:40.290
which, you know, we evacuated
under the pretext of a chemical spill,

16:40.374 --> 16:43.043
but... that won't last much longer.

16:43.919 --> 16:48.841
In a few months, the area will have grown
to where we are right now.

16:51.385 --> 16:54.138
And then we're talking cities...

16:54.972 --> 16:56.181
states... and so on.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.188
You said nothing comes back.

17:04.398 --> 17:05.858
But something has.

17:07.943 --> 17:08.777
Yes.

17:17.619 --> 17:18.579
He's dying.

17:20.622 --> 17:21.457
Yes.

17:24.710 --> 17:28.088
We need to come to an agreement
about what to do with you.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.215
You're not going to let me go home?

17:34.094 --> 17:36.555
Is that what you want

17:40.809 --> 17:41.643
No.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.313
I want to be with him.

18:03.332 --> 18:04.833
You're not talking to me.

18:06.877 --> 18:07.836
Sorry.

18:09.505 --> 18:10.506
Zoned out.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.884
Thinking about the next mission?

18:16.637 --> 18:17.471
No.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.265
I was just looking at the moon.

18:22.976 --> 18:25.771
It's always so weird seeing it like that
in the daylight.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.815
Like God made a mistake.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.775
-Left the hall lights on.

18:30.025 --> 18:31.860
God doesn't make mistakes. That's...

18:32.528 --> 18:34.863
somewhat key
to the whole "being a god" thing.

18:37.032 --> 18:38.200
Pretty sure he does.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.745
You know he's listening right now,
don't you?

18:43.455 --> 18:44.665
You take a cell,

18:44.748 --> 18:47.417
circumvent the Hayflick limit,
you can prevent senescence.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.171
I was about to make the exact same point.

18:51.255 --> 18:54.299
It means the cell doesn't grow old,
it becomes immortal.

18:54.383 --> 18:55.592
Keeps dividing, doesn't die.

18:58.720 --> 19:02.933
They say aging is a natural process,
but it's actually a fault in our genes.

19:05.185 --> 19:07.646
I get really turned on
when you patronize me. It's really hot.

19:07.729 --> 19:10.649
Without it,
I could keep looking like this forever.

19:10.732 --> 19:11.859
Oh, okay.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.236
-Well, that could constitute a mistake.

19:20.284 --> 19:22.494
You didn't tell me
where you're heading this time.

19:24.454 --> 19:27.583
I know there's something strange
about this mission.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.171
Why?

19:33.672 --> 19:36.842
The silence around it
is louder than usual.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.930
Kind of angling for a clue here.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.269
So...?

19:51.815 --> 19:53.358
We'll be under the same hemisphere.

19:55.652 --> 19:56.778
What does that tell me?

19:58.822 --> 20:01.658
It tells you that if you step outside
and you look up...

20:03.493 --> 20:04.995
we'll be looking at the same stars.

20:05.078 --> 20:07.497
-Holy fucking shit.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.293
You think that's what I do
while you're away?

20:12.377 --> 20:15.047
-You think I'm out in the garden,

20:15.130 --> 20:16.840
pining, looking up at the sky?

20:17.758 --> 20:21.803
Shut up. All right.
-Oh, to think my beloved Kane...

20:21.887 --> 20:25.390
-Okay. Uh-huh.
-...is looking at the selfsame moon.

20:25.849 --> 20:26.975
Stop it.

20:27.059 --> 20:30.562
Oh,
my distant celestial friend...

20:30.938 --> 20:32.773
No. No.

20:33.106 --> 20:35.400
...please care for my brave soldier.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.402
Jesus. You know what?
You are disrespectful,

20:37.486 --> 20:40.197
seriously, not only to your former
comrades in the armed forces,

20:40.280 --> 20:42.407
-but also to the president.
-You forgot the flag.

20:42.491 --> 20:45.285
Oh, I'm getting--
I'm getting to the motherfucking flag.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.411
Oh, my hero.

20:46.495 --> 20:48.205
-Screw you.
-Okay.

20:58.590 --> 21:01.802
She's all by herself.
Don't you think we should make friends?

21:01.885 --> 21:04.721
Well, obviously <i>you </i>should.
Yep, I'll do it.

21:08.642 --> 21:09.476
Hey. Hey.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.647
-No, not at all.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.733
Cool. Phew.

21:16.817 --> 21:19.236
You know, I always see you here alone.
It's...

21:20.654 --> 21:24.574
I'm guessing you probably feel weird
or awkward.

21:26.201 --> 21:27.661
Somewhat, I guess.

21:28.787 --> 21:31.498
Don't. Seriously, don't.

21:32.708 --> 21:35.085
The people here put themselves to sleep
in the fetal position

21:35.168 --> 21:36.461
making cooing noises.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.172
It's freaky, you know.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.676
-I'm Anya.
-Lena.

21:43.176 --> 21:44.970
-Nice to meet you.
-You, too.

21:45.095 --> 21:48.181
Um, why don't you come and meet my crew?

21:48.390 --> 21:50.058
Come make friends. Come on.

21:51.893 --> 21:54.187
Ladies, meet Lena.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.273
Hi nice to meet you.

21:56.356 --> 21:59.192
Yeah, that's Cassie Sheppard,
and Josie Radek.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.986
Hi. Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

22:01.069 --> 22:03.780
Do you want to have a seat?
-Thank you.

22:03.905 --> 22:07.159
-So, first day at the Southern Reach.
-Yes.

22:07.492 --> 22:08.744
-Ah!

22:08.869 --> 22:10.287
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.539
You all been here long?

22:13.415 --> 22:15.542
Um, yeah, right from the start.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.085
I'm a geomorphologist.

22:17.169 --> 22:20.255
I've been testing the magnetic fields
around the boundary,

22:20.339 --> 22:23.633
which is like using confetti
to test a hurricane.

22:24.176 --> 22:27.888
Uh, and I've been here... ten months.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.598
Wow, ten months.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.141
Paramedic from Chicago.

22:31.224 --> 22:33.310
Tried to join an NGO,
but my application<i> </i>got flagged,

22:33.393 --> 22:34.644
so Southern Reach got me.

22:34.978 --> 22:37.189
Only two months. I'm a physicist.

22:37.272 --> 22:39.733
I came straight from my Cambridge postdoc.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.818
She's very smart.

22:42.527 --> 22:44.196
What's your story, Lena?

22:44.321 --> 22:46.740
Uh, I'm from Johns Hopkins, biologist.

22:46.823 --> 22:48.492
-Oh, there you go.

22:48.575 --> 22:50.118
-Told you she was smart.
What?

22:50.202 --> 22:53.455
We had a bet on your profession,
and Josie had biologist, of course.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.502
-I had law enforcement.
-I had you as single.

22:58.585 --> 23:01.254
Jesus. Do you have to hit
on everyone, like all the time?

23:01.338 --> 23:02.923
Fuck that. Under the circumstances,

23:03.006 --> 23:05.926
I think I'm allowed to roll the dice
a few more times.

23:06.468 --> 23:07.969
Under what circumstances?

23:10.889 --> 23:13.892
Well, yeah, um, crazy as it seems...

23:14.226 --> 23:16.061
Crazy as it <i>is.</i>

23:18.772 --> 23:20.482
...we are headed that way.

23:25.737 --> 23:28.365
-Six days and counting.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.077
-Four.

23:32.828 --> 23:33.662
Ventress.

23:35.372 --> 23:38.083
Mmm. Team leader.

23:39.459 --> 23:41.336
-All women.
-Scientists.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.965
The previous teams
have been largely military, so, yeah.

23:46.383 --> 23:47.759
What do you think happened to them?

23:48.385 --> 23:51.555
Well, there are two theories
of what went wrong in the Shimmer.

23:52.180 --> 23:54.182
One, something kills them.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.852
Two, they go crazy and kill each other.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.856
There was one military guy
who made it out.

24:00.939 --> 24:01.773
Yeah. A sergeant.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.485
Yeah, but you heard
about the state that he was in.

24:53.700 --> 24:54.701
Kane...

24:57.662 --> 24:59.539
I know why you went in.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.091
I am so sorry.

25:12.844 --> 25:14.846
And I know what I have to do.

25:18.767 --> 25:22.020
<i>So you didn't tell them</i>
<i>about your connection to Sergeant Kane?</i>

25:22.437 --> 25:25.106
I thought it would complicate things.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.025
What?

25:28.193 --> 25:29.444
What would it complicate?

25:36.243 --> 25:38.495
Why are you going into the Shimmer?

25:40.539 --> 25:45.126
The mission statement is to reach
the supposed source of the Shimmer,

25:45.210 --> 25:49.881
the lighthouse,
enter and acquire data, and return.

25:51.716 --> 25:54.886
But I don't think that
that's your mission statement.

26:00.183 --> 26:01.017
No.

26:09.484 --> 26:12.654
I've been watching the phenomenon
for a while now.

26:13.613 --> 26:16.241
I profile the volunteers.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.452
I pick the teams.

26:21.371 --> 26:24.499
They enter, I watch.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.004
I watch it grow closer.

26:32.257 --> 26:34.217
There's only so long one can do that.

26:36.386 --> 26:38.138
But you need to know what's inside?

26:39.973 --> 26:42.058
Yes, I do.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.104
So do I.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.107
So that's the complication.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.110
You want to come with us.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.572
I can't do anything for him here.

26:57.324 --> 26:58.992
Soldier-scientist.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.703
You can fight.

27:02.746 --> 27:03.955
You can learn.

27:06.499 --> 27:07.792
You can save him.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.259
You requested to join the mission.

27:16.801 --> 27:18.887
You knew all other missions had failed

27:18.970 --> 27:21.473
and the only survivor
was barely surviving.

27:22.682 --> 27:23.892
That was a brave choice.

27:25.101 --> 27:25.935
I owed him.

27:28.521 --> 27:30.899
I'm only trying to understand
what drove you.

27:34.235 --> 27:35.362
I owed him...

27:38.239 --> 27:39.115
so I went in.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.907
And then we get some real meals.

30:26.699 --> 30:29.786
Spaghetti.
Here's Radek's vegetable crackers.

30:32.163 --> 30:34.249
Wow, cornbread. That's not so bad.

30:34.749 --> 30:36.042
Oh, you're finally awake.

30:36.793 --> 30:39.838
You gotta give me a second.
I'm a little disoriented.

30:40.296 --> 30:41.589
Join the club.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.217
You don't remember
setting up camp, do you?

30:46.344 --> 30:50.139
I don't remember anything...
after we reached the tree line.

30:51.474 --> 30:52.308
None of us do.

30:53.393 --> 30:54.936
And we did a food inventory.

30:55.019 --> 30:59.941
From the depletion, we've been out here
for at least three or four days.

31:01.651 --> 31:02.485
That's not possible.

31:03.194 --> 31:04.445
That's what I said.

31:06.614 --> 31:11.202
Guys, I've been checking
my comms and nav equipment.

31:11.494 --> 31:13.621
They boot up fine,
no problem with the electronics,

31:13.705 --> 31:15.123
and the camera is working,

31:15.206 --> 31:19.085
but anything that sends a signal
out of the Shimmer... is down.

31:19.794 --> 31:22.672
Even though we've probably got
about 20 satellites above us right now,

31:22.755 --> 31:24.966
and... check this out.

31:28.094 --> 31:32.473
So we've got no compass,
no comms, no coordinates...

31:33.391 --> 31:34.475
and no landmarks.

31:34.559 --> 31:36.436
Well, we know we're in the state park.

31:36.519 --> 31:37.896
We head south, we hit the ocean,

31:37.979 --> 31:41.858
then we can just follow the shoreline
until we hit the perimeter wall. Right?

31:42.984 --> 31:46.029
-Come on, Josie, you know this.

31:46.404 --> 31:47.739
Hour hand at the sun.

31:49.115 --> 31:51.701
Split the difference
between the hour hand and 12, south.

31:52.827 --> 31:53.786
Good.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.163
We're oriented.

31:55.914 --> 31:59.167
We weren't really expecting
the comms equipment to work, were we?

31:59.500 --> 32:03.129
There's been three years of expeditions
and three years of radio silence.

32:04.130 --> 32:06.215
Let's pack up and get moving.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.593
We've already lost a lot of the day.

33:09.529 --> 33:12.323
Oh, I'm gonna check this out.
Get us out of this damn swamp.

33:12.407 --> 33:15.493
All right.
Let's check out the hut.

33:34.137 --> 33:36.431
Looks like someone's
about to have a wedding. These are very strange.

33:42.270 --> 33:43.104
Why?

33:45.231 --> 33:46.858
Well, they're all so different.

33:47.316 --> 33:50.778
To look at them, you wouldn't say
that they're the same species.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.198
But they're growing
from the same branch structure...

33:55.408 --> 33:57.493
so it has to be the same species.

33:58.161 --> 33:59.620
It's the same plant.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.332
It's like they're stuck
in a continuous mutation.

34:03.583 --> 34:04.667
A pathology?

34:05.918 --> 34:06.878
Yeah, well...

34:08.755 --> 34:12.091
you'd sure as hell call it a pathology
if you saw this in a human.

34:22.935 --> 34:24.854
Jackpot.

34:25.146 --> 34:27.732
Sheppard! Mode of transportation.

34:32.945 --> 34:34.363
Anything interesting in there?

34:34.781 --> 34:37.492
No. It's been long abandoned,
maybe even before--

34:39.160 --> 34:40.036
Radek?

34:41.204 --> 34:42.497
Radek!

34:43.081 --> 34:44.415
-Radek!

34:44.499 --> 34:45.708
It's got my bag!

34:45.792 --> 34:47.043
Radek!

34:49.754 --> 34:52.256
Something's got my bag!

34:52.507 --> 34:53.966
Oh, no!

34:54.675 --> 34:55.676
It's got my bag!

35:00.556 --> 35:02.809
Help me with her!
What's going on?

35:04.393 --> 35:05.853
Hey, grab my shoulder!

35:09.065 --> 35:10.483
Get her. Come on.

35:11.984 --> 35:13.069
I got her.

35:13.277 --> 35:14.821
Okay

35:14.904 --> 35:16.280
I got her. Okay.

35:16.364 --> 35:17.406
You're good, you're good.

35:18.533 --> 35:19.367
It's okay.

35:26.207 --> 35:28.668
Let's sit you down.
Help me with her bag.

35:28.751 --> 35:31.129
Okay, just breathe.
It's okay. You're just fine.

35:31.212 --> 35:33.464
-Something in the water.

35:44.934 --> 35:46.769
-Get up, get up. Go.

35:56.612 --> 35:58.322
Oh, shit! Get back.

36:03.035 --> 36:05.830
Sheppard! Sheppard, watch out!

36:09.292 --> 36:11.043
-Holy fuck!

36:52.627 --> 36:53.461
Whoa.

36:55.421 --> 36:57.673
It's exactly the same as the flowers.

36:59.008 --> 37:00.134
Look at the teeth.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.179
Concentric rows.

37:04.013 --> 37:06.933
Something here is making giant waves
in the gene pool.

37:07.516 --> 37:09.060
Sharks have teeth like that, don't they?

37:09.143 --> 37:11.145
Do you think it's a crossbreed?

37:12.521 --> 37:15.608
You can't crossbreed
between different species.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.905
Lena, this is getting heavy.

37:30.456 --> 37:33.000
The mutations were subtle at first.

37:34.210 --> 37:37.505
More extreme as we grew closer
to the lighthouse.

37:39.048 --> 37:41.050
Corruptions of form.

37:42.343 --> 37:44.178
Duplicates of form.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.263
Duplicates?

37:48.849 --> 37:49.767
Echoes.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.607
Is it possible these were hallucinations?

37:59.068 --> 38:01.070
I wondered that myself.

38:02.405 --> 38:04.615
But they were shared among all of us.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.661
It was dreamlike.

38:10.246 --> 38:11.163
Nightmarish.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.165
Not always.

38:15.543 --> 38:17.628
Sometimes it was beautiful.

38:41.819 --> 38:43.946
Ow.

38:46.032 --> 38:46.991
You hurt?

38:47.658 --> 38:49.201
It's just a bruise.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.788
Must have gotten that from the gator.

38:53.289 --> 38:54.123
Yeah.

38:59.128 --> 39:01.172
So, where'd you learn to shoot?

39:03.424 --> 39:05.843
I was in the military
before I was an academic.

39:07.011 --> 39:07.845
Marines?

39:08.304 --> 39:09.930
Army. Seven years.

39:10.639 --> 39:12.683
Feels like a lifetime ago now.

39:12.933 --> 39:13.768
Yeah.

39:15.394 --> 39:17.813
All other lives feel like a lifetime ago.

39:18.397 --> 39:20.441
We were kids, I was married.

39:21.817 --> 39:25.237
Which do you carry around your neck?
A husband or a child?

39:25.738 --> 39:26.655
Husband.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.201
He was in the army, too. That's...

39:30.951 --> 39:32.036
That's how we met.

39:33.287 --> 39:34.580
"Was" in the army

39:36.332 --> 39:37.291
KIA.

39:39.460 --> 39:40.628
I'm sorry to hear that.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.006
Guess there had to be something.

39:44.632 --> 39:45.508
What do you mean?

39:48.135 --> 39:50.638
Volunteering for... this.

39:50.721 --> 39:54.392
It's not exactly something you do
if your life is in... perfect harmony.

39:57.228 --> 39:58.979
We're all damaged goods here.

39:59.939 --> 40:01.065
Anya is sober...

40:01.857 --> 40:03.067
therefore an addict.

40:03.484 --> 40:05.528
Josie wears long sleeves

40:05.611 --> 40:08.322
'cause she doesn't want you
to see the scars on her forearms.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.074
She's tried to kill herself?

40:10.699 --> 40:13.494
No, I think the opposite,
trying to feel alive.

40:16.664 --> 40:17.498
Ventress?

40:18.666 --> 40:21.252
Yeah. As far as anyone knows...

40:22.128 --> 40:26.090
no friends, no family,
no partner, no children.

40:27.216 --> 40:29.009
No concession in her at all.

40:32.179 --> 40:35.099
-I also lost someone.

40:37.935 --> 40:39.520
Not a husband, though, um...

40:39.937 --> 40:42.189
A daughter. Leukemia.

40:43.441 --> 40:44.567
God, I'm sorry.

40:45.317 --> 40:46.986
In a way, it's two bereavements.

40:49.238 --> 40:51.657
My... beautiful girl...

40:53.868 --> 40:55.202
and the person I once was.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.537
Hey, hey!

40:57.455 --> 40:58.831
We got something here.

41:30.362 --> 41:33.115
This used to be the headquarters
of the Southern Reach.

41:34.408 --> 41:35.951
Before the Shimmer swallowed it.

41:39.622 --> 41:40.873
More mutations.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.125
They're everywhere.

41:44.168 --> 41:45.211
Malignant.

41:46.003 --> 41:47.463
Like tumors.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.883
Is that the old mess hall?

41:51.091 --> 41:51.926
Yeah.

41:52.134 --> 41:54.470
Let's billet there. Come on.

42:30.005 --> 42:32.883
There's beds and bags.
You think people are here?

42:34.051 --> 42:35.052
Were here.

42:36.178 --> 42:38.138
Yeah, I'm gonna go with the past tense.

42:58.909 --> 42:59.743
Damn.

43:03.581 --> 43:04.498
Oh.

43:06.166 --> 43:07.459
Oh, shit.

43:17.219 --> 43:19.471
This shit is heavy. Can't carry this.

43:36.488 --> 43:37.656
Lena, what you got going on?

43:39.825 --> 43:41.076
Guys, check this out.

43:43.329 --> 43:45.497
"Peyton, Mayer...

43:47.458 --> 43:49.793
Kane, Shelley."

43:50.377 --> 43:52.546
Those were the soldiers
on the last expedition.

43:52.921 --> 43:55.758
Looks like they were using this room
as their base of operations.

43:55.841 --> 43:57.635
Why are some of the names crossed out?

43:57.718 --> 43:59.345
Let's not jump to conclusions.

43:59.428 --> 44:01.680
-I don't know, maybe we should.
-Yeah.

44:02.306 --> 44:05.684
Yep. This is the mess hall.

44:05.768 --> 44:07.102
Yep.

44:07.186 --> 44:10.230
I think that the times by the names
are a guard rota, so...

44:10.939 --> 44:12.691
if they were guarding the perimeter,
we should.

44:12.775 --> 44:14.443
Copy that.
Yep.

44:27.539 --> 44:29.875
This might be able to tell us something.

44:33.504 --> 44:35.422
"For those that follow."

44:36.799 --> 44:39.301
I believe that means us.

44:48.268 --> 44:49.311
Memory card.

44:52.064 --> 44:53.857
I should be able to play this.

45:01.448 --> 45:02.658
It's working.

45:07.496 --> 45:08.622
<i>All right?</i>

45:13.669 --> 45:15.421
<i></i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

45:15.879 --> 45:16.714
<i>Okay.</i>

45:26.932 --> 45:28.976
<i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i> <i>Okay.</i>

45:29.059 --> 45:30.811
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>
<i>Yeah?</i>

45:30.894 --> 45:32.312
<i>Okay.</i>

45:45.868 --> 45:46.869
Shit.

45:47.911 --> 45:49.079
What is he doing?

45:57.254 --> 45:59.798
<i>Stop. Stop. Stop, stop, stop.</i>

46:01.300 --> 46:02.968
<i>Hold him. Hold him down.</i>

46:05.053 --> 46:06.847
<i>Oh, yeah. Yeah.</i>

46:06.930 --> 46:08.265
<i>There. There.</i>

46:24.990 --> 46:28.202
Okay, so we know what happened
to the last group. They went insane.

46:29.119 --> 46:31.163
-Was something alive inside that man.
-No.

46:31.246 --> 46:33.332
-That was a trick of the light.
What?

46:33.415 --> 46:36.376
I've been a paramedic for 10 years.
I've scraped people off the road.

46:36.460 --> 46:39.338
You see some weird shit.
That was a trick of the light.

46:39.421 --> 46:41.965
His insides were moving.
No, it was shock.

46:42.049 --> 46:44.176
-That was a shock response.
Watch it again.

46:44.259 --> 46:46.011
No, I'm not gonna watch it again!

46:46.094 --> 46:48.055
That was not intestines.
It was a worm--

46:48.138 --> 46:50.224
Okay, then you watch it, Sheppard!

46:54.520 --> 46:55.646
Where are you going?

47:09.910 --> 47:11.620
-Just ahead.

48:08.594 --> 48:09.428
What is it?

48:10.762 --> 48:11.889
I don't know.

48:29.823 --> 48:32.409
-I don't want to stay here tonight.
-We don't have a choice.

48:34.620 --> 48:36.246
Please.
-Come on.

48:36.330 --> 48:39.207
It's too late in the day
for us to move on.

48:39.541 --> 48:41.043
Come on, let's go outside.

49:22.751 --> 49:24.878
Oh, that's nice of you.

49:27.547 --> 49:29.341
Why aren't you here?

49:31.593 --> 49:33.136
I gotta leave a day early.

49:33.887 --> 49:34.763
What?

49:36.139 --> 49:37.391
Wait, today?

49:39.017 --> 49:41.228
-Right now.
-Oh, shit.

49:41.603 --> 49:43.146
But we had a whole day planned.

49:43.230 --> 49:45.273
-We were gonna drive to the country--
-No, we can't.

49:46.191 --> 49:48.193
-We can't.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.117
Now means right now.

49:58.954 --> 49:59.788
Yeah.

50:03.333 --> 50:04.251
What is it?

50:11.675 --> 50:12.592
I do...

50:16.638 --> 50:17.514
love you...

50:18.682 --> 50:19.599
Lena.

50:22.060 --> 50:23.020
I love you, too.

51:20.410 --> 51:21.495
Hey.

51:23.538 --> 51:24.706
The mystery unraveling?

51:26.792 --> 51:28.460
Something's unraveling.

51:29.628 --> 51:31.129
I think you're doing okay.

51:33.548 --> 51:35.050
It's good Josie's getting some rest.

51:35.133 --> 51:35.967
Yeah.

51:36.343 --> 51:38.220
With the help of a little sedative.

51:38.303 --> 51:40.722
How about you

51:41.598 --> 51:42.432
Some.

51:43.558 --> 51:45.644
I'm at least as freaked as Josie.

51:47.354 --> 51:48.980
I'm just hiding it better.

51:52.901 --> 51:54.111
I should check on Ventress.

51:55.987 --> 51:56.822
Yep.

52:28.812 --> 52:31.231
What're you doing up?
Not supposed to relieve me until 3:00.

52:31.314 --> 52:33.233
I'm done sleeping for the night.

52:33.900 --> 52:34.734
Okay.

52:36.653 --> 52:37.737
Come look at this.

52:41.283 --> 52:42.617
Okay, this is where we are...

52:44.327 --> 52:45.745
and that's the lighthouse.

52:46.079 --> 52:48.165
Southwest is Ville Perdu.

52:48.248 --> 52:50.959
It's a small community we evacuated
two years ago.

52:51.585 --> 52:54.254
I think we should head there tomorrow,

52:54.921 --> 52:57.674
and then head out for the coast
the following morning.

53:01.136 --> 53:01.970
Good.

53:07.434 --> 53:08.435
You okay?

53:14.649 --> 53:16.151
I was gonna say, when...

53:16.943 --> 53:19.321
you didn't tell the team
about your connection to Kane,

53:19.404 --> 53:21.364
I wasn't sure if that was a good idea.

53:23.909 --> 53:25.952
But after seeing that footage...

53:29.206 --> 53:30.040
yeah.

53:30.957 --> 53:33.376
I'm not sure how they would have reacted
to you.

53:36.254 --> 53:38.423
Why did my husband volunteer
for a suicide mission?

53:39.132 --> 53:40.800
Is that what you think we're doing?

53:41.635 --> 53:43.803
-You must have profiled him,

53:43.887 --> 53:45.263
you must have assessed him.

53:46.640 --> 53:48.183
He must have said something.

53:49.684 --> 53:51.895
So you're asking me as a psychologist.

53:53.688 --> 53:54.522
Yeah.

53:55.941 --> 53:57.692
Then, as a psychologist...

53:58.693 --> 54:02.280
I'd say you're confusing suicide
with self-destruction.

54:04.783 --> 54:07.035
Almost none of us commit suicide...

54:07.911 --> 54:10.080
and almost all of us self-destruct.

54:10.288 --> 54:12.958
In some way, in some part of our lives.

54:14.292 --> 54:16.920
We drink, or we smoke.

54:17.379 --> 54:19.506
We destabilize the good job.

54:21.883 --> 54:23.176
Or the happy marriage.

54:28.473 --> 54:30.475
These aren't decisions, they're...

54:31.393 --> 54:32.560
They're impulses.

54:32.936 --> 54:37.941
In fact, you're probably better equipped
to explain this than I am.

54:39.985 --> 54:41.236
You're a biologist.

54:42.612 --> 54:45.031
Isn't self

54:45.448 --> 54:46.908
Programmed into each cell?

54:49.869 --> 54:50.870
What was that?

54:50.954 --> 54:52.455
-Don't know.

55:04.384 --> 55:05.302
Josie, wake up.

55:05.552 --> 55:07.762
Wake up, Josie, come on.
Wake up. Something's happening.

55:08.221 --> 55:10.015
-No.

55:10.515 --> 55:12.100
What happened? I heard a noise.

55:13.560 --> 55:14.811
Oh.
What?

55:17.647 --> 55:19.024
Something's come through the fence.

55:20.150 --> 55:22.777
-It's ripped open like a fucking zipper.

55:28.366 --> 55:29.200
Can't see.

55:29.284 --> 55:30.785
-Yeah, neither can I.

55:33.079 --> 55:34.122
Sheppard!

55:34.205 --> 55:35.832
Sheppard!

55:35.915 --> 55:37.876
-Fuck!

55:37.959 --> 55:39.836
Sheppard was next to me.
Something took her.

55:40.920 --> 55:43.923
-Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Sheppard!

55:44.007 --> 55:44.841
Oh, shit!

55:44.924 --> 55:48.553
Help! Help me!

55:52.015 --> 55:53.224
Shepp... Sheppard!

56:02.359 --> 56:03.485
Sheppard!

56:33.181 --> 56:34.224
We have to go back.

56:34.808 --> 56:37.060
-We have to go back now.
She's right.

56:37.310 --> 56:39.062
Right

56:39.145 --> 56:40.605
We've been attacked twice.

56:40.855 --> 56:42.732
We lost one of our own.

56:42.816 --> 56:45.944
We have evidence the previous team
went nuts and chopped each other up.

56:46.027 --> 56:48.446
I really don't know how much more right
she has to be.

56:48.530 --> 56:50.156
We haven't reached the lighthouse.

56:50.240 --> 56:53.159
We still don't understand the cause
or the nature of the Shimmer.

56:53.243 --> 56:55.703
We have data, observations, photographs.
She has hella footage.

56:55.787 --> 56:59.499
All of which makes the phenomenon
less explicable, not more.

57:01.960 --> 57:03.753
I'm gonna get to the lighthouse,

57:03.837 --> 57:05.755
and I'm fine going on my own.

57:05.839 --> 57:10.093
You just need to decide...
whether you're coming with me or not.

57:22.230 --> 57:24.315
It's like she hasn't noticed
that Sheppard is dead.

57:24.399 --> 57:25.567
She's crazy.

57:25.775 --> 57:27.569
She's a crazy old bitch.

57:28.736 --> 57:31.281
You know,
and thanks for the fucking backup, Lena.

57:32.574 --> 57:34.742
-I didn't realize there were sides.
Yeah.

57:35.118 --> 57:36.077
Yeah, there are sides.

57:37.370 --> 57:40.206
Okay, then I agree with you.
We should go back.

57:41.082 --> 57:43.126
Good. Okay, great. There we go. Okay?

57:43.209 --> 57:45.503
-So the three of us can--
Hold on a minute.

57:45.587 --> 57:46.963
We should go back, yes.

57:47.046 --> 57:49.215
But it took us, what,
six days to get here?

57:49.591 --> 57:51.926
And the coast is two days away.

57:52.927 --> 57:55.346
And as Sheppard said...

57:56.347 --> 57:59.726
when we get to the coast,
we can follow it until the perimeter wall.

58:00.185 --> 58:01.936
You're saying we get out
by going deeper?

58:02.687 --> 58:04.689
-Yeah, if you like, yeah.

58:05.064 --> 58:07.692
No, I don't fucking "like."

58:12.155 --> 58:14.782
This isn't some bullshit tactic
to get us to the lighthouse, is it?

58:14.866 --> 58:17.202
This is not about the lighthouse, okay?

58:17.994 --> 58:20.038
I believe that the coast
is the best route out.

58:24.834 --> 58:25.668
Okay?

58:39.224 --> 58:40.225
You lied to them.

58:43.645 --> 58:45.688
I didn't know what going back meant.

58:46.397 --> 58:48.858
Why it would be safer than going forward.

58:50.109 --> 58:53.780
You didn't know, but you made
a decision to continue as if you did.

58:53.947 --> 58:55.281
Ventress made the decision.

58:55.365 --> 58:58.159
Ventress had cancer.
She was never coming back.

58:59.494 --> 59:00.828
You knew she was sick.

59:01.746 --> 59:02.664
I had guessed.

59:06.084 --> 59:07.710
And you wanted to continue.

59:09.963 --> 59:10.797
Yes. I did.

1:00:00.346 --> 1:00:01.889
She could still be alive.

1:00:01.973 --> 1:00:03.433
It's highly doubtful.

1:00:05.226 --> 1:00:06.269
We need to know.

1:00:09.355 --> 1:00:10.189
Go. Fine.

1:00:14.819 --> 1:00:15.695
I'm coming with you.

1:00:17.322 --> 1:00:18.197
I'll go alone.

1:02:47.430 --> 1:02:48.473
Did you find her?

1:02:49.307 --> 1:02:50.141
Yeah.

1:02:51.642 --> 1:02:52.477
She's dead.

1:03:17.502 --> 1:03:18.419
You okay?

1:03:19.420 --> 1:03:22.632
Fine. Just... leave me the fuck alone.

1:03:49.075 --> 1:03:50.827
We'll camp here tonight.

1:03:51.911 --> 1:03:54.121
It's another two hours' walk up the coast.

1:04:32.159 --> 1:04:33.744
They've grown this way.

1:04:34.787 --> 1:04:36.247
That doesn't make any sense.

1:04:37.081 --> 1:04:38.249
I think it does.

1:04:47.550 --> 1:04:51.137
At first I thought the radio waves
were blocked by the Shimmer,

1:04:51.220 --> 1:04:55.349
and that's why no one inside
could communicate with base or GPS,

1:04:55.433 --> 1:05:00.688
but the light waves aren't blocked,
they're refracted, and...

1:05:05.484 --> 1:05:07.278
...it's the same with the radios.

1:05:07.987 --> 1:05:09.488
The signals aren't gone.

1:05:10.072 --> 1:05:11.407
They're scrambled.

1:05:17.663 --> 1:05:19.165
That leaf in your hand...

1:05:20.374 --> 1:05:22.168
know what you'd get if you sequenced it?

1:05:23.085 --> 1:05:25.379
-Human Hox genes.

1:05:25.463 --> 1:05:27.006
Hox

1:05:27.882 --> 1:05:31.928
They're the genes that define
the body plan, the physical structure.

1:05:34.096 --> 1:05:36.223
And the plants have human body plan.

1:05:36.307 --> 1:05:40.770
Arms attached to shoulders. Legs to hips.

1:05:40.853 --> 1:05:42.480
It's literally not possible. It's literally what's happening.

1:05:46.984 --> 1:05:50.655
The Shimmer is a prism,
but it refracts everything.

1:05:51.489 --> 1:05:53.866
Not just light and radio waves.

1:05:54.450 --> 1:05:57.620
Animal DNA, plant DNA...

1:05:58.704 --> 1:06:00.039
all DNA.

1:06:00.539 --> 1:06:01.958
What do you mean, "all DNA"?

1:06:02.875 --> 1:06:04.627
She's talking about our DNA.

1:06:07.505 --> 1:06:08.881
She's talking about us.

1:07:15.531 --> 1:07:18.159
All right... I guess this is a bedroom.

1:07:19.702 --> 1:07:21.537
Let's secure doors and windows.

1:08:47.289 --> 1:08:48.999
This was a mistake.

1:08:51.293 --> 1:08:52.128
Okay.

1:08:58.926 --> 1:09:01.554
You spend more time
away from your husband than with him.

1:09:03.639 --> 1:09:06.892
You can't talk to him about work,
and he won't talk to you about his.

1:09:06.976 --> 1:09:10.980
And there is a clear physical
and intellectual connection between us.

1:09:11.063 --> 1:09:13.149
-You forgot your wife.

1:09:13.232 --> 1:09:14.441
I love my wife.

1:09:17.319 --> 1:09:18.737
She's blameless in this.

1:09:27.329 --> 1:09:28.205
Come on, Lena.

1:09:29.957 --> 1:09:31.584
What's really going on here?

1:09:33.669 --> 1:09:36.005
You think that something
may have happened to him?

1:09:41.051 --> 1:09:42.386
Or you think he knows.

1:09:45.264 --> 1:09:46.307
That's it, isn't it?

1:09:47.266 --> 1:09:49.894
You think somehow he's found out
about our affair.

1:09:52.104 --> 1:09:53.147
Has he found out?

1:09:54.481 --> 1:09:55.316
Yes.

1:09:59.069 --> 1:09:59.945
You should go.

1:10:02.448 --> 1:10:03.866
-No, Lena, I--
-Dan...

1:10:04.867 --> 1:10:08.829
I'm not interested in talking...
or in anything you have to say.

1:10:10.039 --> 1:10:11.540
Just get dressed and get out.

1:10:14.376 --> 1:10:17.046
You know, it's not me you hate,
it's yourself.

1:10:20.507 --> 1:10:21.967
No, Dan, it's you, too.

1:10:26.138 --> 1:10:27.640
It's never gonna happen again. You lying bitch!

1:10:36.815 --> 1:10:38.525
-No.

1:10:39.276 --> 1:10:42.196
You don't get to ask
that fucking question. You answer it!

1:11:11.725 --> 1:11:12.559
Brother. Boyfriend.

1:11:17.982 --> 1:11:18.816
Husband.

1:11:22.903 --> 1:11:24.113
Husband.

1:11:26.365 --> 1:11:29.326
Why didn't you tell us?

1:11:30.661 --> 1:11:33.789
-You knew. Obviously.

1:11:42.589 --> 1:11:44.508
-Okay.

1:11:49.221 --> 1:11:51.265
There are two theories
of what went wrong.

1:11:51.348 --> 1:11:52.975
One is that something in here killed them.

1:11:53.058 --> 1:11:56.895
Two... is that they went crazy
and they killed each other.

1:11:58.731 --> 1:12:00.899
Josie nearly got killed by an alligator,

1:12:00.983 --> 1:12:03.610
and Cass did get killed by a bear.

1:12:06.113 --> 1:12:08.198
So, yes, theory one, it fits.

1:12:11.452 --> 1:12:12.286
But...

1:12:15.247 --> 1:12:16.957
I didn't actually see a bear.

1:12:18.459 --> 1:12:19.626
And neither did Josie.

1:12:20.794 --> 1:12:22.921
The only people who saw
were Lena and Ventress.

1:12:23.464 --> 1:12:26.175
So nothing's confirmed.
Everything's on their word.

1:12:26.550 --> 1:12:30.888
-Everything's on Lena's word.

1:12:31.263 --> 1:12:32.681
And what we know now...

1:12:34.141 --> 1:12:37.019
what we know,

1:12:37.394 --> 1:12:40.647
is that Lena... is a liar.

1:12:40.731 --> 1:12:42.816
-Shut the fuck up!

1:12:44.485 --> 1:12:48.155
Lena... you're a liar.

1:12:51.241 --> 1:12:52.076
Did you kill Cass?

1:12:54.995 --> 1:12:56.372
Did you lose your shit?

1:12:59.500 --> 1:13:02.419
Or do you think I've lost my shit
and we're gonna fuck each other up?

1:13:02.503 --> 1:13:03.837
That's theory two.

1:13:09.635 --> 1:13:10.844
Oh, God.

1:13:15.641 --> 1:13:17.309
When I look at my hands...

1:13:18.310 --> 1:13:19.728
and my fingerprints...

1:13:21.438 --> 1:13:22.564
I can see them moving.

1:13:26.110 --> 1:13:29.238
I can't.

1:13:30.114 --> 1:13:31.615
If I let you go,

1:13:32.074 --> 1:13:34.743
and you tie me to a chair
and cut me open...

1:13:36.495 --> 1:13:39.957
are my insides gonna move
like my fingerprints?

1:13:47.381 --> 1:13:51.218
But... I'm not the one tied to a chair.

1:13:55.431 --> 1:13:56.598
-You are.

1:14:01.353 --> 1:14:03.313
Help me!

1:14:06.150 --> 1:14:07.359
Help me!

1:14:07.901 --> 1:14:09.278
Help me!

1:14:09.778 --> 1:14:11.321
Oh, Cass?

1:14:14.366 --> 1:14:16.785
-You said she was dead.

1:14:16.994 --> 1:14:19.455
Cass! Cass, I'm coming!

1:14:21.457 --> 1:14:23.750
Cass, is that you

1:15:06.877 --> 1:15:11.840
Help me! Help me!

1:15:12.674 --> 1:15:15.010
Help!

1:15:29.608 --> 1:15:30.651
Don't react.

1:15:31.443 --> 1:15:32.444
Mmm.

1:15:38.283 --> 1:15:41.328
Me!

1:16:07.646 --> 1:16:11.525
Help!

1:16:24.037 --> 1:16:25.622
Me!

1:16:34.840 --> 1:16:38.677
No! No!

1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:40.095
No!

1:16:58.196 --> 1:17:00.907
Me!

1:17:14.546 --> 1:17:18.550
Help... me...

1:17:42.366 --> 1:17:43.825
What are you doing?

1:17:44.201 --> 1:17:46.203
-I'm leaving.
Now?

1:17:48.580 --> 1:17:51.208
-It's not even light yet.
-I don't have time to wait.

1:17:51.625 --> 1:17:53.251
We are disintegrating.

1:17:53.335 --> 1:17:55.420
Our bodies as fast as our minds.
Can't you feel it?

1:17:57.130 --> 1:17:59.049
It's like the onset of dementia.

1:18:02.094 --> 1:18:03.762
If I don't reach the lighthouse soon...

1:18:04.471 --> 1:18:07.891
the person that started this journey
won't be the person that ends it.

1:18:08.225 --> 1:18:10.102
I want to be the one that ends it.

1:19:12.497 --> 1:19:13.874
We should go, Josie.

1:19:21.923 --> 1:19:24.092
How long was your husband in the Shimmer?

1:19:26.219 --> 1:19:28.096
It's hard to say exactly.

1:19:31.099 --> 1:19:33.143
Theoretically, as long as a year.

1:19:35.645 --> 1:19:38.940
That's a long time to be inside
and remain intact.

1:19:39.816 --> 1:19:41.651
I'm not so sure he was intact.

1:19:45.989 --> 1:19:46.907
I'm right...

1:19:48.366 --> 1:19:52.204
-Yeah.

1:19:52.829 --> 1:19:54.664
I checked my blood last night.

1:19:57.292 --> 1:19:59.461
It's... in me.

1:20:02.631 --> 1:20:04.674
It will be in all of us.

1:20:11.056 --> 1:20:12.891
It was so strange hearing...

1:20:13.767 --> 1:20:17.062
Sheppard's voice in the mouth
of that creature last night.

1:20:18.396 --> 1:20:21.483
I think as she was dying,
part of her mind became...

1:20:22.400 --> 1:20:24.528
part of the creature that was killing her.

1:20:26.738 --> 1:20:29.407
Imagine dying frightened and in pain,

1:20:29.491 --> 1:20:32.744
and having that as the only part of you
which survives.

1:20:34.204 --> 1:20:35.872
I wouldn't like that at all. Ventress wants to face it.

1:20:59.229 --> 1:21:00.480
You want to fight it.

1:21:02.274 --> 1:21:05.110
But I don't think I want
either of those things.

1:21:12.534 --> 1:21:13.368
Josie. Josie.

1:21:26.798 --> 1:21:27.757
Josie!

1:21:54.117 --> 1:21:58.079
One by one, all gone, except you.

1:22:00.290 --> 1:22:01.583
How do you explain that?

1:22:05.712 --> 1:22:07.714
Is it something I need to explain?

1:22:08.590 --> 1:22:09.883
Yes, you do.

1:22:16.598 --> 1:22:17.724
I had to come back.

1:22:19.809 --> 1:22:21.561
I'm not sure any of them did.

1:22:23.855 --> 1:22:26.608

1:27:37.293 --> 1:27:38.753

<i>I had a life.</i>

1:27:50.056 --> 1:27:51.516
<i>People called me Kane.</i> <i>And now I'm not so sure.</i>

1:28:00.650 --> 1:28:02.443
<i>If I wasn't Kane, what was I?</i>

1:28:08.908 --> 1:28:09.784
<i>Was I you</i>

1:28:26.759 --> 1:28:28.219
<i>My flesh moves...</i>

1:28:29.554 --> 1:28:30.596
<i>like liquid.</i>

1:28:34.392 --> 1:28:35.476
<i>My mind is...</i>

1:28:38.021 --> 1:28:38.980
<i>just cut loose.</i>

1:28:39.897 --> 1:28:42.483
<i>I can't bear it. </i>

1:28:43.943 --> 1:28:44.986
<i>I can't bear it.</i>

1:28:45.903 --> 1:28:47.196
<i> I can't bear it.</i>

1:28:52.493 --> 1:28:57.540
<i>You ever seen a phosphorus grenade go off?</i>
<i>They're kind of bright.</i>

1:28:59.709 --> 1:29:00.918
<i>Shield your eyes.</i>

1:29:02.754 --> 1:29:05.089
<i>If you ever get out of here,</i>
<i>you find Lena.</i>

1:29:06.299 --> 1:29:07.342
<i>I will.</i>

1:29:08.509 --> 1:29:09.344
No.

1:29:12.138 --> 1:29:17.268
<i>Five, four, three, two...</i>

1:29:35.036 --> 1:29:37.538
No, no, no.<i> </i>No.

1:29:40.583 --> 1:29:44.128
Oh. Oh, God. Oh, my God.

1:29:44.712 --> 1:29:45.546
No.

1:31:10.923 --> 1:31:13.092
It's the last phase.

1:31:14.969 --> 1:31:17.013
Vanished into havoc.

1:31:20.475 --> 1:31:23.519
Unfathomable mind...

1:31:27.064 --> 1:31:29.192
...and now beacon.

1:31:29.984 --> 1:31:31.611
Now sea.

1:31:42.330 --> 1:31:43.247
Lena.

1:31:50.963 --> 1:31:52.215
We spoke.

1:31:53.883 --> 1:31:55.426
What was it we said?

1:32:01.140 --> 1:32:05.728
That I needed to know
what was inside the lighthouse.

1:32:08.648 --> 1:32:09.941
That moment's passed.

1:32:13.903 --> 1:32:15.655
It's inside me now.

1:32:17.073 --> 1:32:19.116
What's... inside you?

1:32:20.326 --> 1:32:21.702
It's not like us.

1:32:22.828 --> 1:32:24.664
It's unlike us.

1:32:27.917 --> 1:32:29.544
I don't know what it wants.

1:32:30.294 --> 1:32:31.546
Or if it wants.

1:32:32.630 --> 1:32:33.965
But it will grow...

1:32:34.423 --> 1:32:36.467
until it encompasses everything.

1:32:39.637 --> 1:32:40.721
Our bodies and our minds

1:32:40.805 --> 1:32:44.016
will be fragmented
into their smallest parts until...

1:32:44.850 --> 1:32:46.936
not one part remains.

1:32:51.566 --> 1:32:53.025
Annihilation.

1:35:47.533 --> 1:35:49.744
No, no, no. No!

1:44:12.204 --> 1:44:13.538
So it was alien.

1:44:20.671 --> 1:44:22.214
Can you describe its form?

1:44:27.094 --> 1:44:27.970
No.

1:44:28.971 --> 1:44:30.681
Was it carbon

1:44:34.726 --> 1:44:35.560
I don't know.

1:44:38.480 --> 1:44:39.731
What did it want?

1:44:41.400 --> 1:44:43.402
I don't think it wanted anything.

1:44:43.860 --> 1:44:46.405
But it... it attacked you.

1:44:47.322 --> 1:44:48.699
It mirrored me.

1:44:49.700 --> 1:44:50.784
I attacked it.

1:44:52.411 --> 1:44:54.454
I'm not sure it even knew I was there.

1:44:54.538 --> 1:44:56.164
It came here for a reason.

1:44:57.541 --> 1:45:01.211
It was mutating our environment,
it was destroying everything.

1:45:02.504 --> 1:45:04.506
It wasn't destroying. It was changing everything.

1:45:08.885 --> 1:45:10.887
It was making something new.

1:45:14.016 --> 1:45:14.975
Making what?

1:45:23.275 --> 1:45:24.192
I don't know.

1:45:28.739 --> 1:45:31.450
A team reached the lighthouse
a few hours ago.

1:45:32.659 --> 1:45:34.244
Everything is ash.

1:45:34.953 --> 1:45:38.123
If what you encountered was once alive...

1:45:38.957 --> 1:45:40.334
it seems it's now dead.

1:46:02.272 --> 1:46:04.816
Now will you tell me what happened
to my husband?

1:46:06.568 --> 1:46:08.236
<i>When the Shimmer disappeared,</i>

1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:12.366
<i>his blood pressure stabilized</i>
<i>and his pulse rate started to rise.</i>

1:46:13.867 --> 1:46:15.994
<i>A few hours later, he was not only awake,</i>

1:46:16.078 --> 1:46:17.162
<i>he was lucid.</i>

1:46:18.830 --> 1:46:20.916
<i>He's still in isolation, obviously.</i>

1:46:22.376 --> 1:46:23.377
<i>So am I.</i>

1:47:07.546 --> 1:47:08.672
You aren't Kane...

1:47:10.507 --> 1:47:11.425
are you?

1:47:18.056 --> 1:47:19.182
I don't think so.

1:47:27.607 --> 1:47:28.692
Are you Lena?
