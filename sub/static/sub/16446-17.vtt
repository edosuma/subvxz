00:00.984 --> 00:02.418
Previously on Lucifer...

00:02.485 --> 00:04.725
Operation "Help Lucifer
Escape From the Hospital."

00:04.750 --> 00:06.273
And you, my dear doctor,

00:06.298 --> 00:07.920
are going to help me. Let's go.

00:07.945 --> 00:09.420
The three of you plan to use...

00:09.445 --> 00:11.500
this Flaming Sword

00:11.525 --> 00:14.015
to cut through the gates
of Heaven and go home.

00:14.040 --> 00:16.172
- What does Maze think of your plan?
- Well, I don't know; I haven't told her.

00:16.196 --> 00:18.257
So what, are you going on a vacation?

00:18.297 --> 00:19.797
Lucifer didn't tell you.

00:19.865 --> 00:21.757
We're all going back to Heaven.

00:21.782 --> 00:25.476
She's been acting very
odd recently, on edge.

00:25.501 --> 00:26.938
This obsession with getting home

00:27.005 --> 00:28.720
is a bit much, don't you think?

00:29.250 --> 00:31.166
That's because only you,

00:31.191 --> 00:33.993
my Lightbringer, can ignite it.

00:34.018 --> 00:35.798
- That's it?
- It's all I've got!

00:35.823 --> 00:37.079
You have to try harder.

00:37.104 --> 00:39.759
I'm not broken; the sword must be.

00:39.784 --> 00:41.665
This is what Uriel
was trying to tell me.

00:41.690 --> 00:43.548
There's another piece missing.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.354 --> 01:07.255
Lucifer, we need to
talk about something.

01:07.280 --> 01:08.931
What... Can it wait?

01:08.956 --> 01:11.859
I'm busy keeping an eye
on our mercurial mother.

01:11.927 --> 01:15.196
No, it's important. I think
you might be in danger.

01:16.409 --> 01:17.977
Is it the Yakuza?

01:18.044 --> 01:19.311
The Nephilim?

01:19.379 --> 01:20.846
One Million Mums?

01:20.914 --> 01:22.393
It's Maze.

01:22.418 --> 01:23.938
She's angry with you, brother.

01:25.184 --> 01:27.001
Well, is it Tuesday already?

01:27.026 --> 01:28.756
Anger is Maze's default setting,

01:28.781 --> 01:30.949
sort of baked into her demon DNA.

01:30.974 --> 01:33.361
No, this is different, Luci.

01:33.386 --> 01:35.094
I think you really need to talk to her.

01:35.119 --> 01:37.827
She'll get over it; she always does.

01:37.852 --> 01:39.486
Right now, we have bigger
issues to deal with,

01:39.510 --> 01:42.352
like whether or not
Mum is wasting our time.

01:43.663 --> 01:45.030
If she believes her client

01:45.098 --> 01:48.100
has found another piece of
the Flaming Sword, so do I.

01:48.167 --> 01:51.303
Oh, such a loyal son.

01:51.371 --> 01:54.386
But Mum hasn't adapted to this
world as well as you might think.

01:54.411 --> 01:57.417
This chap could be conning her.

01:58.111 --> 02:02.323
- I think I'm gonna go make sure...
- She seems to be doing just fine.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.317
That's not the money, is it?

02:07.350 --> 02:09.783
Of course not. She wouldn't
bring it to the meeting.

02:10.229 --> 02:11.613
Oh, no. Of course not.

02:11.638 --> 02:13.035
I mean, that would be
absurd, wouldn't it?

02:13.059 --> 02:14.425
She's just showing it to him.

02:14.450 --> 02:16.409
I mean, it's not like
she's gonna hand it to him

02:16.434 --> 02:18.493
before she... gets the piece.

02:18.518 --> 02:19.831
That's great.

02:20.940 --> 02:23.854
And now she's letting
him leave. Marvelous.

02:27.854 --> 02:29.207
Well, that went well.

02:29.275 --> 02:31.751
- Oh, you think so, do you?
- I do.

02:31.776 --> 02:34.880
He has what we need in
his safe in the back room.

02:34.947 --> 02:37.115
- Oh.
- He's going to get it right now.

02:37.183 --> 02:40.171
Mum, you just handed him
a briefcase full of cash

02:40.196 --> 02:42.097
with no proof whatsoever
he has what we need.

02:42.122 --> 02:44.861
- And?
- You've been conned.

02:44.886 --> 02:46.702
He's a client of mine, darling.

02:46.727 --> 02:48.784
I don't think he'd be that foolhardy.

02:48.809 --> 02:50.213
Oh.

02:52.593 --> 02:55.057
Well, I'm sure he'll be right back.

02:57.045 --> 02:58.908
Maybe we should go
check just to be sure.

02:58.934 --> 03:00.768
I think that's a good idea, don't you?

03:01.754 --> 03:03.154
Oh.

03:07.636 --> 03:10.459
Huh. See? He didn't con me.

03:10.526 --> 03:13.128
Look, instead he's dead,
and someone robbed him

03:13.196 --> 03:15.089
of what's ours... much better.

03:15.114 --> 03:19.034
Well, the good news is, after
this spectacular bungling,

03:19.102 --> 03:21.703
I happen to work with
a homicide detective.

03:21.771 --> 03:23.071
If you find the killer,

03:23.146 --> 03:24.883
then you'll find our
piece of the Flaming Sword.

03:24.907 --> 03:26.311
- Hey, but, Mom...
- The challenge is...

03:26.335 --> 03:28.744
making sure we catch the case
before some other detective.

03:28.811 --> 03:30.645
- But what about...
- I may be able to help.

03:30.713 --> 03:33.315
Really? I'm all ears.

03:43.106 --> 03:46.294
- Is everything all right here?
- Yeah, everything's fine, Maze.

03:46.362 --> 03:49.387
You can, uh, you-you
can put away the knives.

03:51.675 --> 03:54.005
We'll be in touch, Dr. Martin.

03:57.925 --> 03:59.478
Excuse me.

04:01.072 --> 04:03.072
Uh, Maze.

04:03.520 --> 04:04.664
Maze.

04:05.374 --> 04:06.808
Oh, my Lord.

04:08.478 --> 04:10.033
Who the hell was that?

04:10.058 --> 04:14.494
That was the chairman of
the ethics review board.

04:14.519 --> 04:16.986
- Are you okay?
- No.

04:17.817 --> 04:19.555
No, I am not.

04:20.189 --> 04:21.750
No, Maze. No, no, no, don't, don't.

04:21.776 --> 04:23.210
That won't do any good.

04:23.986 --> 04:25.172
What happened?

04:25.197 --> 04:28.136
A couple of weeks ago,
I maybe, sort of...

04:28.204 --> 04:31.680
helped Lucifer break out
of a mental institution.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.742
Using my own name.

04:34.376 --> 04:36.869
- It's my fault, really.
- No, it is not your fault.

04:36.894 --> 04:39.986
It is Lucifer's fault.
It's always Lucifer's fault.

04:40.011 --> 04:42.736
First, I find out he's
ditching me to go to Heaven,

04:42.761 --> 04:44.886
and now he's hurting you.

04:45.361 --> 04:48.078
Look, I'm gonna fix this, Linda.

04:48.103 --> 04:50.939
And then him and I are
gonna have a little talk.

05:09.595 --> 05:12.344
- Hey, I should get my own desk.
- Not happening.

05:12.369 --> 05:13.831
Right next to yours
would probably be best.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.048
Definitely not happening.

05:15.073 --> 05:17.166
Why are you hovering over me?

05:17.191 --> 05:20.522
I'm not hovering. I'm just
spending time with my partner.

05:20.590 --> 05:22.548
Oh, well, since you're here,

05:22.573 --> 05:25.111
why don't you help me
with this paperwork.

05:25.701 --> 05:27.736
I could really get
used to this, partner.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.476
Right. Yes, on second thought,

05:29.501 --> 05:31.148
maybe a desk in the far corner might...

05:31.173 --> 05:32.968
- Mm-mm.
- Oh! Ms. Richards.

05:33.035 --> 05:36.251
Detective Decker. Just the
woman I was hoping to see.

05:36.624 --> 05:39.258
Well, I feel the opposite.
If you'll excuse me.

05:39.283 --> 05:40.581
Hear me out.

05:40.606 --> 05:43.158
A client of mine called.
He sounded very worried.

05:43.183 --> 05:45.681
I think he might be in terrible danger.

05:45.706 --> 05:46.906
Oh, that's awful.

05:46.931 --> 05:49.509
- Detective, we should do something.
- He's at a bar downtown.

05:49.534 --> 05:52.906
Would you come with me and
make sure that he's okay?

05:52.931 --> 05:54.285
Nope.

05:54.310 --> 05:56.541
- Nope?
- I'm a homicide cop.

05:56.566 --> 06:00.001
I do not go around checking
on worried criminals

06:00.026 --> 06:01.619
like a nanny, Charlotte.

06:01.644 --> 06:05.228
- So if we're done here.
- I heard... things.

06:07.558 --> 06:10.329
On a... on-on the phone call.

06:10.947 --> 06:12.313
Like?

06:13.766 --> 06:16.774
Fingers... pointing.

06:17.335 --> 06:21.173
You heard... fingers pointing?

06:21.783 --> 06:23.283
Very angrily.

06:23.624 --> 06:25.110
Yes.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.748
Also, a gunshot.

06:28.773 --> 06:30.607
Sounded like he was...

06:30.661 --> 06:33.263
dying, or, um...

06:33.471 --> 06:35.174
melting?

06:35.587 --> 06:37.978
It's hard to tell.

06:38.003 --> 06:40.999
- Charlotte...
- It sounds worth our time, actually.

06:41.066 --> 06:42.367
Agreed.

06:42.434 --> 06:44.636
Why didn't you just lead with that?

06:50.603 --> 06:52.424
The lock's damaged.

06:52.449 --> 06:53.760
Is it?

06:56.712 --> 06:58.592
Looks like you're right.

06:59.114 --> 07:01.082
He's been dead about an hour.

07:01.107 --> 07:02.858
Oh? Impressive guess, Detective.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.061
Uh, I'm assuming from the...

07:05.702 --> 07:07.522
discoloration.

07:09.194 --> 07:11.247
Well, that wasn't a
complete Dumpster fire,

07:11.272 --> 07:13.273
but now that we're finished,
you can see yourself out.

07:13.297 --> 07:15.298
I'll do nothing of the sort.

07:15.323 --> 07:17.256
Fine. I'll show you out, if you insist.

07:17.281 --> 07:19.600
I'm not going anywhere.

07:19.625 --> 07:22.662
But the detective and I have
got everything handled now.

07:22.687 --> 07:25.489
This is far too important to
leave to just the two of you.

07:25.514 --> 07:28.179
- I will stick around.
- Mum.

07:28.247 --> 07:30.522
Besides, we'll get to work together.

07:30.547 --> 07:32.522
Won't that be fun?

07:37.094 --> 07:41.358
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

07:42.108 --> 07:44.829
We're running tests for
gunshot residue and cocaine.

07:44.854 --> 07:46.231
Should have those in,
like, five minutes.

07:46.255 --> 07:47.722
Okay. Good.

07:49.792 --> 07:51.393
Oh, Charlotte.

07:51.461 --> 07:52.811
You're still here, huh?

07:52.836 --> 07:54.311
Well, he was my client.

07:54.336 --> 07:56.428
I thought I might be
of help to the case.

07:56.453 --> 07:58.671
But if not, we could
always get her to shoo along

07:58.696 --> 07:59.882
and we can carry on with our business.

07:59.906 --> 08:01.803
No. I'm sure she could be very helpful.

08:01.828 --> 08:03.070
So tell me, why does Zeke Moore,

08:03.094 --> 08:05.131
a manager at an import/export company,

08:05.156 --> 08:06.678
have you representing him?

08:06.725 --> 08:08.826
- Because I'm the best.
- At getting criminals off.

08:08.894 --> 08:10.194
Well, that's not true.

08:10.262 --> 08:12.196
I haven't slept with any of my clients.

08:12.264 --> 08:13.618
What?

08:13.651 --> 08:15.303
You represent the worst of the worst.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.978
So why was Zeke a client?

08:17.046 --> 08:18.670
Because he works for Bianca Ruiz.

08:18.695 --> 08:20.194
What? The tequila magnate?

08:20.219 --> 08:22.300
Bianca's tequila empire is a front.

08:22.325 --> 08:25.311
She uses the distribution
routes to sell guns, drugs,

08:25.336 --> 08:27.823
and, oh, yeah, people.

08:27.890 --> 08:30.147
So we've been after her for a long time.

08:30.172 --> 08:31.709
Who do you think did this?

08:31.734 --> 08:33.735
A rival of some sort?

08:33.760 --> 08:35.494
Well, that's actually a good question.

08:35.519 --> 08:36.833
Ella, what do we have?

08:36.859 --> 08:38.874
Well, no smoking gun,

08:38.899 --> 08:41.501
but poor Zeke here got shot twice.

08:41.525 --> 08:42.866
First in the thigh...

08:42.890 --> 08:45.428
bullet winged him... and then another

08:45.453 --> 08:49.322
went through his hand
hitting him in the chest.

08:49.347 --> 08:51.491
Probably trying to defend himself.

08:51.595 --> 08:53.363
Too bad you can't catch bullets.

08:53.388 --> 08:54.730
Well, he can't maybe.

08:54.755 --> 08:56.501
I don't think this
was a professional hit.

08:56.526 --> 08:58.353
Maybe a robbery gone wrong.

08:58.421 --> 09:00.275
And idea of what was taken?

09:00.300 --> 09:02.884
Well, trace elements point to cash,

09:02.909 --> 09:06.211
cocaine, gunpowder residue,
indicating weapons...

09:06.236 --> 09:08.587
all your basic bad guy stuff.

09:08.612 --> 09:10.465
No sign of forced entry, though.

09:10.533 --> 09:13.109
Which means the killer
either knew the combination,

09:13.134 --> 09:15.237
or he just waited for the
vic to open it to strike.

09:15.262 --> 09:16.466
Mm-hmm.

09:16.491 --> 09:19.728
Hey, I got something here.

09:21.803 --> 09:23.337
Cell phone.

09:23.362 --> 09:26.251
No dust on it, so it
hasn't been there long.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.183
Well, Zeke had his phone on him,

09:28.251 --> 09:29.918
so this one could be the killer's.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.501
Maybe he dropped it during the fight

09:31.526 --> 09:34.565
or just didn't have time to retrieve it.

09:34.590 --> 09:37.267
Passcode protected, of course.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.571
But the home screen is... two eyes?

09:40.608 --> 09:41.774
Human female breasts.

09:41.857 --> 09:44.290
No. That is a woman's
perfectly freckled rump.

09:44.315 --> 09:46.807
So our lead on the killer

09:46.832 --> 09:50.696
is a pair of butt-boob-eyes.

09:51.039 --> 09:52.595
It's a great start.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.208
Hello, Daniel.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.161
What are you doing here?

10:12.186 --> 10:14.044
Ms. Ruiz there...

10:14.427 --> 10:15.731
is my client.

10:15.756 --> 10:18.784
Well, she's a real piece of work.

10:21.014 --> 10:23.382
Trying to make me jealous?

10:23.407 --> 10:25.402
What do you want from me?

10:25.427 --> 10:27.495
You seduce me, you betray
me, now you're back.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.662
You have to want something,
I just can't figure out what.

10:29.686 --> 10:31.520
I do want something, you're right.

10:31.545 --> 10:32.879
And I'll tell you.

10:32.904 --> 10:36.036
Just somewhere private.

10:38.155 --> 10:39.789
I'm not having sex with you here.

10:39.856 --> 10:43.011
But I need something to pass
the time until we get a lead.

10:43.036 --> 10:44.905
I don't understand you.

10:44.930 --> 10:47.306
All right, whatever this is between us.

10:47.331 --> 10:50.867
Well, it's simple, Daniel Espinoza.

10:51.796 --> 10:53.430
I like you.

10:56.652 --> 10:58.240
♪ I get that money ♪

10:58.308 --> 11:00.109
♪ That money don't get me ♪

11:00.177 --> 11:03.446
♪ Oh, ain't it funny how
they all want to be a G ♪

11:03.513 --> 11:04.780
♪ I make it happen... ♪

11:04.848 --> 11:06.148
You guys, it's a record label.

11:06.216 --> 11:09.031
The symbol on the phone we
found is the label's logo.

11:09.056 --> 11:11.244
And they choose to publish this music

11:11.269 --> 11:12.574
of their own free will?

11:12.599 --> 11:14.878
It's a vanity label.
It exists only to make

11:14.903 --> 11:16.605
this one guy's music.

11:16.630 --> 11:17.910
Okay, well, who owns it?

11:17.935 --> 11:20.417
And can you please turn it off?

11:20.442 --> 11:22.109
Chet Ruiz.

11:22.175 --> 11:23.620
Bianca's youngest son.

11:23.645 --> 11:26.042
Half our billing goes to
keeping him out of jail.

11:26.067 --> 11:27.800
So Bianca's own son

11:27.825 --> 11:31.363
robbed and killed one of
her most loyal soldiers?

11:31.388 --> 11:34.050
The files barely mention Chet.
I didn't know he was actually

11:34.075 --> 11:35.976
- part of the family business.
- He's not.

11:36.001 --> 11:38.566
Bianca tries to keep him as far
away from it all as possible.

11:38.591 --> 11:41.175
Maybe he started to resent
that, decided to make a play?

11:41.200 --> 11:43.533
And then dropped his phone,
proving just how right

11:43.558 --> 11:44.894
his mother was about him.

11:44.919 --> 11:46.762
Well, if Chet is the killer,
this could be our chance

11:46.786 --> 11:48.949
to take down Bianca, as well.

11:48.974 --> 11:50.972
Cut off the head of
her entire operation.

11:50.997 --> 11:52.278
This could be huge.

11:52.303 --> 11:55.368
Yeah. Bummer is the phone
proves that Chet was in the room

11:55.435 --> 11:58.153
but doesn't definitively
tie him to the murder.

11:58.178 --> 12:00.412
Dan, why don't you work
on hacking the passcode.

12:00.437 --> 12:01.974
I'll have a chat with Chet.

12:02.042 --> 12:04.277
And, Charlotte, thank
you so much for your help.

12:04.344 --> 12:06.363
But now that one of your
clients is our main suspect,

12:06.387 --> 12:07.684
it's best you go.

12:07.709 --> 12:09.410
I don't think I have to go quite yet.

12:09.435 --> 12:11.145
Maybe not, but I think you should.

12:11.170 --> 12:13.356
Bianca's having a party today.

12:13.381 --> 12:15.746
It's the launch of her new tequila.

12:15.771 --> 12:18.206
I'm sure Chet will be there, and...

12:18.231 --> 12:19.528
I'm invited.

12:19.553 --> 12:20.895
Why do you want to help us now?

12:20.920 --> 12:22.320
Because we all want the same thing:

12:22.376 --> 12:24.907
to find out who robbed and killed Zeke.

12:24.932 --> 12:26.638
You know, Chloe, it
would be a good chance

12:26.663 --> 12:28.052
for us to go undercover.

12:28.077 --> 12:30.277
Gather some intel before they
even know we're onto them.

12:31.319 --> 12:32.550
- All right.
- Fine.

12:32.575 --> 12:33.673
Good. It's settled.

12:33.740 --> 12:35.841
The detective and I will go, so
thank you so much for your help.

12:35.865 --> 12:37.677
I don't think so.

12:37.702 --> 12:39.590
The invitation is under my name.

12:39.615 --> 12:41.323
I will go.

12:41.348 --> 12:44.652
Perhaps Detective
Espinoza should join me.

12:45.252 --> 12:46.887
No. Yes, that's not happening.

12:46.912 --> 12:49.201
- Uh, very well. I'll go with you...
- No, I'll go with Charlotte.

12:49.225 --> 12:51.215
- But, Detective...
- No more argument.

12:51.240 --> 12:53.928
Very well. But I
suggest you go shopping.

12:53.953 --> 12:57.004
This isn't the kind of place
you can attend in pajamas.

12:58.809 --> 13:00.907
This is ridiculous.

13:01.199 --> 13:02.918
Pajamas?

13:02.943 --> 13:04.347
What if Ella goes to the party?

13:04.372 --> 13:06.074
That sounds like a great idea.

13:06.099 --> 13:08.601
Oh, my God. Thank you so
much for thinking of me.

13:08.626 --> 13:10.776
But you know what? I'm so busy.

13:10.801 --> 13:12.304
I have been sidelined

13:12.329 --> 13:14.504
by my own mother and the detective.

13:14.529 --> 13:16.058
It's absurd.

13:16.083 --> 13:17.174
I won't stand for it.

13:17.199 --> 13:19.500
I am gonna find a way into that party.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.455
Do you always whine like this?

13:22.480 --> 13:25.024
I don't know how she puts up with it.

13:25.092 --> 13:26.762
Where's Dr. Linda?

13:26.787 --> 13:28.301
Suspended.

13:28.326 --> 13:29.972
Because of you.

13:29.997 --> 13:31.605
Because you have been a terrible,

13:31.630 --> 13:33.457
selfish friend.

13:34.556 --> 13:35.972
To her.

13:36.804 --> 13:38.338
Now you're gonna fix it.

13:38.363 --> 13:41.365
Well, gladly, once I figure
a way back onto the case.

13:41.390 --> 13:44.303
No, Lucifer.

13:44.328 --> 13:45.929
Now!

13:46.600 --> 13:49.015
But I suppose they can
handle things without me

13:49.082 --> 13:50.614
for the time being.

13:50.639 --> 13:52.518
What's the plan?

13:56.414 --> 13:59.019
It'll take two hours to scan the phone.

14:01.003 --> 14:02.061
I'll come to you.

14:02.129 --> 14:04.534
I'll kill some time till it's done.

14:04.559 --> 14:06.019
See you soon.

14:09.635 --> 14:10.970
Hey, man.

14:11.045 --> 14:12.445
You looking for your brother?

14:12.506 --> 14:13.873
Or my m... um...

14:13.940 --> 14:15.241
Charlotte?

14:15.308 --> 14:16.502
Listen, um...

14:16.527 --> 14:18.378
are they here? Because I
haven't been able to reach them.

14:18.402 --> 14:19.735
No, they took off.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.142
Couple hours ago.

14:21.167 --> 14:22.201
Of course they did.

14:22.226 --> 14:24.294
And why would they
bother to let me know?

14:24.885 --> 14:26.081
I could try to call them for you.

14:26.105 --> 14:27.893
Don't worry about it, Dan.

14:28.255 --> 14:29.550
I mean, with a brother like Lucifer,

14:29.574 --> 14:31.441
I really should be used to this, right?

14:31.903 --> 14:33.137
Hey.

14:33.779 --> 14:35.347
What are you doing right now?

14:57.816 --> 14:59.151
Charlotte Richards.

14:59.715 --> 15:02.149
Have you seen my plus one?

15:02.174 --> 15:03.823
She's a tired-looking blonde.

15:03.890 --> 15:07.593
Probably dressed in something
freshly-plucked from the floor.

15:07.661 --> 15:08.794
- Mm-mm.
- Hmm?

15:25.764 --> 15:27.878
Let's get this pajama party started.

15:42.905 --> 15:44.865
I still don't understand
why you're helping us.

15:44.890 --> 15:46.315
Bianca's your client.

15:46.340 --> 15:48.873
I'm not the same woman
I was when she hired me.

15:48.898 --> 15:50.631
Hmm. Did you have a change of heart?

15:50.656 --> 15:52.154
No, the same heart.

15:52.179 --> 15:53.880
Completely different soul, though.

15:53.948 --> 15:54.975
Hmm.

15:56.365 --> 15:58.818
There's Chet. I'll go talk to him.

15:58.886 --> 16:00.303
You know, that's wise.

16:00.328 --> 16:01.684
You seem more his type than me,

16:01.709 --> 16:03.419
and you're not
particularly intimidating,

16:03.444 --> 16:05.382
- so that should help.
- Help what?

16:05.426 --> 16:08.006
Well, in seducing him, of course.

16:08.326 --> 16:10.397
I'm not gonna seduce him, Charlotte.

16:10.464 --> 16:12.532
Not with that posture you're not.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.795
- Fine. I'll do it.
- No. No.

16:14.820 --> 16:16.403
There's gonna be no seducing.

16:16.470 --> 16:18.138
We just need to get Chet to talk,

16:18.205 --> 16:19.673
have him incriminate himself,

16:19.740 --> 16:22.008
then we can arrest him
and flip him on Bianca.

16:22.076 --> 16:24.477
You expect him to betray his own mother?

16:24.545 --> 16:27.714
One that's given him
everything he's ever wanted?

16:27.782 --> 16:30.074
Not all kids appreciate what
their parents have given them.

16:30.098 --> 16:31.518
Well, that I agree with.

16:31.543 --> 16:34.680
I just think with a little
pressure, he'll crack.

16:34.705 --> 16:36.323
Oh, bodyguard.

16:36.390 --> 16:38.666
Maybe he's not as easy
to get to as I thought.

16:38.691 --> 16:40.760
Why would an overprotective mother

16:40.828 --> 16:43.274
bring her murderous son
to a tequila-fueled party?

16:43.299 --> 16:46.455
Well, if her son killed
Zeke, she has no idea.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.627
Okay. I've got an idea.

16:56.828 --> 16:59.469
Dr. Linda Martin is an amazing therapist

16:59.494 --> 17:01.090
and an incredible woman.

17:01.115 --> 17:02.596
You can't do this to her.

17:02.621 --> 17:05.417
Well, I'm afraid that she
brought this on herself.

17:05.486 --> 17:07.454
So, unless there's something...

17:07.480 --> 17:09.579
specific that you can tell me,

17:09.604 --> 17:11.690
there's very little that I can do.

17:11.714 --> 17:12.868
Hmm.

17:13.815 --> 17:17.464
Well, how about proof of
all the good she's done?

17:17.531 --> 17:20.233
Like this guy. Lucifer Morningstar.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.635
Oh, that's quite flattering.

17:21.702 --> 17:23.618
The worst patient anyone could ask for.

17:24.714 --> 17:26.815
He is a back-stabbing, selfish,

17:26.839 --> 17:28.699
narcissistic little devil.

17:28.743 --> 17:31.869
- He's greedy...
- Is there a-a point to this?

17:31.894 --> 17:33.354
Yes, I'm wondering the same thing.

17:33.379 --> 17:36.044
The point is, despite all of that,

17:36.069 --> 17:38.537
she went out of her way to help him.

17:38.562 --> 17:40.020
Yeah, she's right.

17:40.087 --> 17:43.223
The doctor has seen a
side to me that I hide

17:43.290 --> 17:45.704
because it's, well, terrifying.

17:45.729 --> 17:47.284
But she accepted me nonetheless,

17:47.309 --> 17:50.612
and she's helped me through issues
that I thought insurmountable.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.910
I appreciate the testimonial,

17:53.934 --> 17:56.936
and I will include it into the notes.

17:57.318 --> 17:58.685
That's it?

17:58.710 --> 18:00.678
Unless you have more evidence to submit.

18:02.810 --> 18:04.549
Well, she's generous.

18:04.574 --> 18:06.850
As a, as a therapist, as a lover,

18:06.875 --> 18:08.323
- a friend...
- Wait.

18:10.284 --> 18:12.377
- You slept with your therapist.
- What?

18:12.402 --> 18:13.784
O-only in the beginning.

18:13.809 --> 18:16.143
Then she decided that I shouldn't
pay for therapy with sex.

18:16.168 --> 18:18.135
So, such strong morals, don't you think?

18:18.160 --> 18:19.268
Let's go!

18:19.293 --> 18:20.326
What the...?

18:20.351 --> 18:22.299
Oh, no, no, she saved my life.

18:22.354 --> 18:24.097
I mean, granted, she killed me first,

18:24.165 --> 18:25.732
- but I did ask her.
- Oh, my God.

18:25.757 --> 18:27.122
Lucifer.

18:29.729 --> 18:33.533
We actually have been trying
to get the formula for...

18:33.566 --> 18:34.940
Charlotte.

18:34.965 --> 18:36.854
Excuse me. Oh.

18:36.879 --> 18:37.979
Mmm.

18:38.336 --> 18:40.704
So glad you can make
it. How are the children?

18:40.729 --> 18:42.682
They're angels.

18:43.249 --> 18:45.417
But speaking of children...

18:45.948 --> 18:47.620
What did Chet do now?

18:47.688 --> 18:49.729
Run out on another tab?

18:50.545 --> 18:54.955
The police suspect him
of killing Zeke Moore.

18:54.980 --> 18:56.276
That's impossible.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.651
I have it from a very good source.

18:59.369 --> 19:01.159
I'll get to the bottom of it.

19:01.184 --> 19:02.418
Thank you, Charlotte.

19:02.443 --> 19:03.752
- As always.
- Of course.

19:03.777 --> 19:04.940
Enjoy.

19:10.051 --> 19:11.682
What did you do?

19:12.809 --> 19:14.346
What could I do?

19:14.371 --> 19:16.402
You won't let me drink, my bank
account's pretty low lately...

19:16.426 --> 19:18.674
Zeke Moore. What did you do?

19:19.437 --> 19:21.135
I took care of a problem.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.393
You're welcome.

19:22.418 --> 19:23.798
You don't work for me.

19:23.823 --> 19:25.862
But I should. Look what I can do.

19:25.948 --> 19:27.916
Yeah, remove one of my best earners?

19:29.500 --> 19:31.935
You see, this is why you need me, Ma.

19:31.960 --> 19:34.742
I found out that Zeke was
building up his own business.

19:34.767 --> 19:36.838
Smuggling up rare artifacts on the side.

19:36.863 --> 19:38.729
And I was making 30%.

19:39.148 --> 19:40.548
Oh.

19:40.573 --> 19:42.370
Well, I would have known that
if you had just given me...

19:42.394 --> 19:43.955
How do the police know it was you?

19:43.980 --> 19:45.362
I may have...

19:46.119 --> 19:48.056
dropped my phone.

19:48.081 --> 19:51.205
Chet, what was on your phone?

19:52.854 --> 19:54.815
Let's go somewhere quieter.

19:54.840 --> 19:57.108
No, Mom. Mom, Mom.

19:59.979 --> 20:02.516
The whole business?

20:02.541 --> 20:04.706
I was just trying to learn how
the financial part worked, Ma.

20:04.730 --> 20:06.152
You know, prove to you I
could be a part of this.

20:06.176 --> 20:08.890
So you saved it on your phone,
which the police now have.

20:08.915 --> 20:09.949
Don't worry.

20:09.972 --> 20:11.440
I'm already taking care of it.

20:11.465 --> 20:13.119
Won't be a problem.

20:17.977 --> 20:19.362
What?

20:20.718 --> 20:22.452
Hello.

20:37.567 --> 20:39.166
Improv?

20:40.586 --> 20:42.073
Really?

20:44.729 --> 20:47.323
Come on, man, you promised
me you wouldn't laugh.

20:49.659 --> 20:51.913
I went through a lot this last year.

20:51.981 --> 20:55.283
And improv sort of
helped me reorient myself.

20:55.909 --> 20:57.291
How?

20:58.119 --> 21:00.922
Well, it took stepping outside of myself

21:00.990 --> 21:03.425
to figure out who I really was.

21:03.493 --> 21:06.595
You know, stop defining
myself by other people.

21:06.662 --> 21:08.864
Chloe. Lucifer.

21:08.931 --> 21:10.232
I see.

21:10.299 --> 21:12.834
So you think I'm defining
myself by my brother, yeah?

21:12.902 --> 21:14.102
Well, I know from experience,

21:14.170 --> 21:17.182
the dude casts a pretty big-ass shadow.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.991
Well, if there is one
constant in the universe,

21:20.016 --> 21:21.799
it's that Lucifer's the favorite.

21:22.318 --> 21:23.940
No matter what I do.

21:23.965 --> 21:27.244
No matter how hard I work
or how much he screws up.

21:28.091 --> 21:30.252
It's never gonna change.

21:34.866 --> 21:37.099
You guys must have competed
over everything, huh?

21:38.219 --> 21:39.717
I mean, he would never admit it, right?

21:39.741 --> 21:42.525
But yeah. Yeah, everything.

21:42.839 --> 21:44.236
Even women?

21:45.580 --> 21:47.620
Eh, I just noticed that you and Lucifer

21:47.645 --> 21:49.678
have a weird relationship
with Charlotte Richards.

21:49.703 --> 21:50.776
I just thought maybe you guys...

21:50.800 --> 21:53.035
No, Dan, we are not
competing over Charlotte.

21:53.403 --> 21:54.963
Trust me.

21:56.419 --> 21:58.320
At least, not in the way you think.

21:58.388 --> 22:01.580
And if we are, well, obviously I lost.

22:02.225 --> 22:04.126
Because I'm here, with you.

22:05.261 --> 22:06.885
No offense.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.322
Yeah, none taken.

22:09.866 --> 22:11.102
Oh, man.

22:11.127 --> 22:13.049
They couldn't crack the passcode.

22:13.588 --> 22:16.008
But, uh, for what it's worth,

22:16.033 --> 22:18.830
I like you a hell of a lot
more than I like your brother.

22:29.361 --> 22:32.680
I know everyone here except you.

22:32.705 --> 22:34.723
What are you doing here?

22:35.885 --> 22:37.361
I, uh...

22:37.386 --> 22:39.220
I'm... uh, was...

22:39.245 --> 22:41.635
I came because, well...

22:42.377 --> 22:44.666
I love your son's music.

22:44.691 --> 22:45.830
Hi, Chet.

22:45.855 --> 22:47.908
Chet, you're so good. You're amazing.

22:47.933 --> 22:50.588
Oh, please. I've seen the sales.

22:50.613 --> 22:53.916
Nobody actually listens
to that... stuff.

22:53.941 --> 22:56.814
Oh, I listen to it, big-time.

22:56.839 --> 22:59.158
♪ I-I... get that money ♪

22:59.183 --> 23:01.814
- ♪ That money don't get me ♪
- ♪ Me! ♪

23:01.839 --> 23:03.661
♪ Oh, ain't it funny how y'all ♪

23:03.686 --> 23:05.034
- ♪ Wanna be the G... ♪
- ♪ Wanna be the G ♪

23:05.058 --> 23:07.356
- I've heard enough.
- ♪ I make it... ♪

23:07.423 --> 23:09.257
- Yeah.
- That's enough, ma'am.

23:09.325 --> 23:10.459
Chet, you're so good.

23:10.484 --> 23:11.502
- You're dope!
- Let's go.

23:11.527 --> 23:14.029
- I love you. I...
- I love you more.

23:19.273 --> 23:22.025
Dan. Hey. Look, that phone...

23:22.050 --> 23:24.627
I think it is way more
important than we thought.

23:24.652 --> 23:27.682
It might be the key
to taking down Bianca.

23:30.079 --> 23:31.513
Great. Now that we've solved that,

23:31.581 --> 23:33.248
I can get back to the case and...

23:33.316 --> 23:35.846
Ooh! God! What?!

23:35.871 --> 23:38.120
What? You just made everything worse.

23:38.187 --> 23:40.656
Why am I surprised? Just leave.

23:40.723 --> 23:43.158
Since that's been your
plan all along anyway.

23:43.226 --> 23:45.360
Is that what all this has been about?

23:46.996 --> 23:49.783
Amenadiel told you about our
trip back to Heaven, didn't he?

23:49.808 --> 23:51.369
Don't you blame him.

23:51.394 --> 23:52.528
- You...
- Aah!

23:52.553 --> 23:53.752
...should have told me.

23:53.777 --> 23:55.837
Well, if you understood
the full picture...

23:55.862 --> 23:56.963
Oh!

23:56.988 --> 23:58.840
Stop hitting me.

23:58.908 --> 24:00.056
Then explain.

24:00.081 --> 24:01.982
Well, I'd like to,
but you have a tendency

24:02.007 --> 24:04.439
- to get emotional about things.
- Aah!

24:04.464 --> 24:05.898
Case in point.

24:05.923 --> 24:08.314
So I needed to be
controlled, is that it?

24:08.339 --> 24:09.908
What the hell am I, Lucifer...

24:09.933 --> 24:11.696
a pawn in some plan of yours?

24:11.721 --> 24:13.322
No, I wouldn't put it like that.

24:13.347 --> 24:15.533
Of course you wouldn't,
because that would actually

24:15.558 --> 24:18.694
require you understanding
how you affect people.

24:18.994 --> 24:21.530
- How you hurt them.
- Oh! Aah!

24:21.597 --> 24:23.899
You seem to be the one doing
the hurting at the moment.

24:23.966 --> 24:26.501
You don't care about
anyone other than yourself.

24:26.526 --> 24:29.328
Unless they can be of use to you.

24:30.506 --> 24:32.174
Sound familiar?

24:32.564 --> 24:35.486
Tread very carefully, Maze.

24:37.480 --> 24:40.837
You're just like your parents.

24:46.039 --> 24:47.506
Aah!

24:56.971 --> 24:58.423
- Aah!
- Oh!

25:05.079 --> 25:07.414
Maybe... maybe we should

25:07.439 --> 25:09.899
just take a time-out so that...

25:09.924 --> 25:11.611
you can catch your breath.

25:11.636 --> 25:14.055
Yeah, so you can catch your breath.

25:14.080 --> 25:18.111
And then, I'll get back
to kicking your ass.

25:21.235 --> 25:23.003
See, now...

25:23.530 --> 25:26.361
I had no idea that you
were this mad at me.

25:29.742 --> 25:31.943
You were gonna leave me.

25:34.127 --> 25:36.703
I would never do that.

25:36.728 --> 25:40.078
But you told Amenadiel and your mom

25:40.103 --> 25:43.039
that y... you were going
with them to Heaven.

25:43.064 --> 25:46.172
Well, I didn't say how long for.

25:46.197 --> 25:47.594
Huh?

25:47.662 --> 25:50.408
Or what I was gonna do when I got there.

25:53.534 --> 25:55.869
You're playing your own angle.

26:01.737 --> 26:04.172
And you didn't tell me...

26:06.076 --> 26:08.552
because you needed me
to be angry with you

26:08.577 --> 26:10.949
so you could sell your story.

26:10.974 --> 26:12.576
Exactly!

26:13.709 --> 26:16.098
So, all this...

26:16.123 --> 26:17.390
was for nothing.

26:21.037 --> 26:24.206
Lucifer, that's even worse.

26:33.389 --> 26:35.202
This phone could be the key

26:35.227 --> 26:37.083
to taking down the entire Ruiz empire.

26:37.108 --> 26:39.343
Yeah, but how do we crack it
if cyber couldn't even do it?

26:39.367 --> 26:41.888
Time. That idiot
didn't install a program

26:41.913 --> 26:43.233
that can remotely wipe the phone.

26:43.281 --> 26:46.264
And it's an older phone
with just a four-digit code.

26:46.289 --> 26:47.820
So, what, we just keep
trying till we get in?

26:47.844 --> 26:50.387
- How long will that take?
- There are only 10,000 options.

26:50.455 --> 26:52.780
Well, actually, 9,996 now...

26:52.805 --> 26:55.490
I took a couple stabs.
So, hey, making progress.

26:55.515 --> 26:57.280
I would say maybe a month.

26:57.305 --> 26:59.568
Well, we can't arrest 'em till
we know what's on that phone.

26:59.592 --> 27:00.796
And if they decide to
make a run for it...

27:00.820 --> 27:02.281
All right. Let's just
try to speed it up.

27:02.305 --> 27:03.547
Let's look into Chet's background,

27:03.571 --> 27:05.101
let's try and come up
with number combinations

27:05.125 --> 27:06.851
that might be meaningful
to him, all right?

27:06.876 --> 27:08.061
Let's go.

27:11.586 --> 27:13.010
Did you guys...

27:13.078 --> 27:15.413
kill the chairman of the review board?

27:15.438 --> 27:17.397
Please tell me you didn't kill him.

27:17.422 --> 27:18.882
Not that he didn't deserve it,

27:18.950 --> 27:21.087
the smug, insufferable...

27:21.112 --> 27:24.040
No, no. No one's dead.
We did this to each other.

27:24.065 --> 27:25.656
Though...

27:25.723 --> 27:28.525
when it comes to your case,
I fear I may have, um...

27:28.550 --> 27:30.312
complicated things.

27:31.296 --> 27:32.963
Lucifer told him you used to screw.

27:33.031 --> 27:35.332
- Among other things.
- Oh?

27:35.759 --> 27:37.118
Oh.

27:39.904 --> 27:41.305
Well, I guess that's that.

27:41.372 --> 27:42.618
No, that isn't that.

27:42.643 --> 27:44.575
I want to know why she's
still upset with me.

27:44.642 --> 27:47.392
Since I'm not currently a
practicing doctor of psychiatry,

27:47.417 --> 27:49.632
I don't have to lead you
on this path of realization;

27:49.657 --> 27:50.972
I can just tell you.

27:51.015 --> 27:54.954
Maze is pissed at you
because you used her.

27:54.979 --> 27:56.429
Sure.

27:56.454 --> 27:59.154
But for the greater good of
our debauchery here in L.A.

27:59.179 --> 28:01.014
Did you even once think
of how this affected her?

28:01.038 --> 28:03.069
Of course I did.

28:03.094 --> 28:05.095
Thought about how she
might ruin everything

28:05.163 --> 28:08.251
by disemboweling my mum
or castrating my brother.

28:08.276 --> 28:10.367
I meant her feelings.

28:10.435 --> 28:12.736
- What?
- She thought...

28:12.804 --> 28:15.048
you abandoned her.

28:16.007 --> 28:19.009
That you didn't care
how that affected her.

28:19.034 --> 28:22.566
But those sort of things
never bothered her be...

28:25.794 --> 28:27.928
before.

28:29.543 --> 28:31.353
Oh.

28:34.626 --> 28:36.160
Mazikeen.

28:36.660 --> 28:38.761
I didn't realize...

28:42.834 --> 28:45.335
I should have realized.

28:50.370 --> 28:53.506
Well, my work here is done.

28:55.339 --> 28:57.091
Literally.

28:57.982 --> 28:59.216
So, if you'll excuse me,

28:59.284 --> 29:03.957
I'm going to find a very stiff martini.

29:11.777 --> 29:13.178
Linda.

29:14.049 --> 29:15.983
I'll take care of this.

29:16.008 --> 29:17.707
I promise.

29:30.448 --> 29:32.049
Bianca.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.005
Has something happened?

29:34.435 --> 29:36.093
Yes.

29:37.138 --> 29:39.870
My son robbed and
killed Zeke, as you know.

29:39.895 --> 29:42.759
But then he showed me
what Zeke was smuggling.

29:43.287 --> 29:44.821
And for whom.

29:45.442 --> 29:47.004
Now I have it.

29:47.612 --> 29:50.267
And I think it's very
important to you, isn't it?

29:50.335 --> 29:53.151
- It is.
- Then let's make a deal.

29:53.176 --> 29:55.155
I'll give it to you

29:55.180 --> 29:57.195
if you get my son's
phone from the police.

29:58.401 --> 29:59.768
That's not possible.

29:59.793 --> 30:01.180
You'll find a way.

30:02.187 --> 30:05.086
Otherwise, I'll make
sure that what you want...

30:05.111 --> 30:07.221
disappears forever.

30:19.195 --> 30:22.963
Birthday reverse. Nope.

30:23.187 --> 30:25.311
Double 69.

30:25.899 --> 30:27.933
Oddly relieved that's not it.

30:29.365 --> 30:31.133
Ms. Lopez.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.835
We haven't really had
the chance to meet.

30:33.903 --> 30:37.500
I know. I've been looking
forward to a formal "hey-ya."

30:37.525 --> 30:39.733
- S... uh...
- Uh, no, I see you're still

30:39.758 --> 30:41.859
working on the phone.

30:41.884 --> 30:43.801
I knew Chet well.

30:43.826 --> 30:47.028
Perhaps I could borrow it,
maybe try some combinations?

30:47.964 --> 30:50.106
I see through you.

30:51.599 --> 30:53.856
I know you are waiting around

30:53.881 --> 30:55.642
for my boy Dan.

30:55.709 --> 30:57.210
Oh.

30:57.278 --> 30:58.831
Caught me red-handed.

30:58.856 --> 31:02.276
And even though most
everybody is all like,

31:02.301 --> 31:03.783
"She a shark,

31:03.851 --> 31:06.419
"those dead eyes, don't trust her,"

31:06.487 --> 31:08.421
when I look at you...

31:08.882 --> 31:10.590
I see a light.

31:10.658 --> 31:12.181
Did my bandage come undone?

31:12.240 --> 31:14.716
So, for now,

31:14.741 --> 31:16.894
benefit of the doubt.

31:17.174 --> 31:19.442
But if you ever hurt Dan again,

31:19.467 --> 31:22.155
I'll have someone break your legs.

31:28.075 --> 31:29.394
Oh, that's my brother.

31:29.419 --> 31:31.988
I've been trying to get
ahold of him forever.

31:32.746 --> 31:34.283
Can you watch the phone?

31:34.308 --> 31:35.757
Sure.

31:35.782 --> 31:37.329
Thanks.

31:37.939 --> 31:41.075
See? Light.

31:48.136 --> 31:49.862
Start talking.

32:07.082 --> 32:08.348
Ah!

32:11.373 --> 32:13.028
What happened to you?

32:13.053 --> 32:16.652
Oh, this. It's just a little
fisticuffs between friends.

32:16.677 --> 32:20.026
I just had a very enlightening
conversation with Charlotte Richards.

32:20.094 --> 32:21.527
Ah. Well, I've had my fill

32:21.595 --> 32:24.421
of enlightening conversations
for today, thank you.

32:25.202 --> 32:27.300
Lucifer, she told me who she really is,

32:27.368 --> 32:29.248
and how you two are related.

32:29.273 --> 32:31.738
I somehow doubt that.

32:31.763 --> 32:33.573
No, it all makes sense.

32:33.641 --> 32:35.008
Why you were so disgusted

32:35.075 --> 32:37.276
when I suggested you
two had slept together.

32:37.301 --> 32:39.202
Why you act so weird
around her in general.

32:39.227 --> 32:41.643
She... really told you.

32:41.668 --> 32:43.467
What did she tell you?

32:43.492 --> 32:45.809
That she's your father's ex.

32:47.888 --> 32:49.881
Right, yes, no. That's-that's true.

32:49.906 --> 32:51.257
Right, yeah.

32:51.282 --> 32:52.971
I mean, the way she
talked about your dad

32:52.996 --> 32:55.264
and-and what he put her through.

32:55.289 --> 32:58.084
Mm-hmm. Betrayal,
torture, Hell, et cetera.

32:58.109 --> 32:59.599
- All true.
- Mm-hmm.

32:59.667 --> 33:03.136
I just cannot imagine raising
kids with someone like that.

33:03.161 --> 33:06.426
Sympathy for the goddess, Detective?

33:06.451 --> 33:08.917
Why didn't you just tell
me she was your step-mom?

33:08.942 --> 33:12.703
Well, it didn't seem
that simple to explain.

33:12.728 --> 33:15.281
I mean, how did this
all come about, anyway?

33:15.349 --> 33:17.316
Well...

33:17.341 --> 33:20.211
I... I caught Charlotte
trying to steal evidence

33:20.236 --> 33:22.021
for Bianca Ruiz.

33:22.089 --> 33:23.256
What?

33:23.323 --> 33:24.557
Why would she do that?

33:24.625 --> 33:26.025
Well, apparently Bianca figured out

33:26.060 --> 33:28.038
that Charlotte and I were
working together at the sting.

33:28.062 --> 33:29.604
Bianca threatened Charlotte's family.

33:29.629 --> 33:32.250
I mean, she threatened
you if she didn't help.

33:32.346 --> 33:34.794
Well, that sounds plausible, yes.

33:34.819 --> 33:36.586
I don't know.

33:37.004 --> 33:38.604
Something about it doesn't feel right.

33:38.672 --> 33:40.888
I don't know if I can trust her.

33:41.018 --> 33:42.775
Well, I mean, I know I'm biased,

33:42.843 --> 33:45.090
but one thing's for certain, Detective:

33:45.115 --> 33:46.846
Charlotte Richards will stop at nothing

33:46.914 --> 33:48.865
to protect her children.

33:50.158 --> 33:53.386
- You can trust that.
- Hmm.

33:54.507 --> 33:57.623
- Did you bring me what I asked for?
- Mm.

33:58.916 --> 34:00.783
As promised.

34:03.913 --> 34:05.883
Make sure it's real.

34:06.180 --> 34:08.047
That it wasn't cloned.

34:18.340 --> 34:20.882
_

34:22.306 --> 34:25.016
To the things a mother
will do for her children.

34:25.085 --> 34:27.020
I'll drink to that.

34:28.435 --> 34:30.262
I can't even count the times

34:30.286 --> 34:32.637
that Chet has come close to
destroying everything I've built.

34:32.661 --> 34:35.612
Children always find
new ways to test us.

34:35.638 --> 34:37.167
She's talking about Amenadiel.

34:37.192 --> 34:39.380
Put us through... hell.

34:39.406 --> 34:40.963
That one's me.

34:41.031 --> 34:43.263
And yet we still protect them.

34:43.288 --> 34:44.902
Always.

34:50.150 --> 34:51.888
_

34:54.349 --> 34:56.449
Now for your side of the bargain.

35:04.015 --> 35:05.265
We lost the feed.

35:05.290 --> 35:06.742
- She's up to something.
- Well, no, no, no.

35:06.766 --> 35:07.931
She may have just shorted the bug.

35:07.955 --> 35:10.032
No. Charlotte Richards
is either screwing us over

35:10.057 --> 35:11.168
or she's in trouble.

35:11.193 --> 35:12.489
Guys, get ready to go in.

35:12.514 --> 35:14.345
And she better be in trouble.

35:17.767 --> 35:20.489
This opens a safety deposit box.

35:20.514 --> 35:22.703
Inside you'll find what
Zeke was smuggling for you.

35:22.728 --> 35:24.744
This isn't what we agreed to.

35:24.769 --> 35:27.599
How do I know you'll hold
up your end of the deal?

35:27.624 --> 35:29.592
Because I always do.

35:30.168 --> 35:31.400
And quite honestly, I don't see why

35:31.424 --> 35:33.425
you put so much value in...

35:33.450 --> 35:35.238
Freeze! See your hands!

35:36.119 --> 35:39.231
LAPD. Bianca Ruiz, you're under arrest.

35:39.256 --> 35:40.957
This is absurd.

35:40.982 --> 35:43.735
Charlotte. Charlotte.

35:43.760 --> 35:46.295
Will no longer be representing you.

35:46.943 --> 35:50.168
You're making a terrible mistake.

35:51.123 --> 35:52.768
Don't touch me.

35:52.836 --> 35:55.411
Charlotte, are you okay?

35:55.436 --> 35:56.805
- Yes.
- Lucifer, don't.

35:56.873 --> 35:58.207
Step away. I need to search her.

35:58.275 --> 36:00.100
Well, I don't think that's
necessary, Detective.

36:00.124 --> 36:03.159
- Well, I do.
- It's okay, son.

36:03.184 --> 36:04.451
Fine.

36:04.476 --> 36:05.810
Arms out.

36:09.152 --> 36:10.653
Hmm.

36:10.889 --> 36:13.536
Oh, you're being incredibly thorough.

36:14.759 --> 36:16.548
I like it.

36:19.229 --> 36:21.385
- She's clean.
- Well, I told you, Detective,

36:21.410 --> 36:22.998
she's got nothing to hide.

36:23.066 --> 36:24.800
The phone was still unlocked.

36:24.868 --> 36:26.536
We have everything.

36:26.561 --> 36:28.623
Seems like we do.

36:30.421 --> 36:32.078
Let's, uh...

36:45.020 --> 36:46.606
A book?

36:46.631 --> 36:49.037
That's what Zeke smuggled for me?

36:50.825 --> 36:52.569
Is this a joke?

36:52.594 --> 36:54.324
Well, if it were, I would
have chosen something funnier,

36:54.348 --> 36:56.302
like Douglas Adams or Freud.

36:56.327 --> 36:57.995
Are you certain...

36:58.020 --> 37:00.191
that this is all that was
in the safety deposit box?

37:00.270 --> 37:01.659
Well, how is a book

37:01.684 --> 37:03.151
supposed to ignite the sword?

37:03.176 --> 37:05.540
Maybe it's an instruction manual.

37:07.576 --> 37:10.208
In an ancient language I can't read.

37:10.233 --> 37:11.833
Wonderful.

37:11.858 --> 37:12.899
Here.

37:12.924 --> 37:15.049
Wh... I can't read it.

37:15.117 --> 37:16.988
But you speak every language.

37:17.013 --> 37:18.314
Speak, not read.

37:18.339 --> 37:20.288
I've always found tongues
much more useful than books.

37:20.312 --> 37:21.866
So whatever language this is...

37:21.891 --> 37:23.659
It's Sumerian.

37:24.167 --> 37:26.746
Unlike some of us who had
everything handed to him,

37:26.771 --> 37:28.967
I actually spent my youth studying.

37:30.269 --> 37:31.615
Excellent.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.229
My smart boy.

37:34.670 --> 37:37.448
How-how quickly can you translate it?

37:37.473 --> 37:40.026
Um, should only take me a few days.

37:40.051 --> 37:41.652
Days?

37:41.677 --> 37:43.611
I don't have that kind of time.

37:43.679 --> 37:46.481
Mum, why have you got your
knickers in such a twist?

37:46.548 --> 37:48.883
Is there a reason why
you're in such a rush lately?

37:48.951 --> 37:52.648
I-I'm just anxious to see
the rest of the family.

37:52.673 --> 37:55.955
Please start translating.

38:00.095 --> 38:02.296
There's something going on with her.

38:02.364 --> 38:05.724
Yeah. Or it's just that
time of the millennium.

38:08.604 --> 38:10.489
What?

38:19.210 --> 38:20.848
Excuse me.

38:20.916 --> 38:23.030
Not this time.

38:28.690 --> 38:29.974
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:29.999 --> 38:32.804
Congrats on nabbing Queen Tequila.

38:33.117 --> 38:34.827
Well, Chet's still out there,

38:34.852 --> 38:37.487
so this isn't over until I find him.

38:37.633 --> 38:39.200
You and Charlotte Richards...

38:39.225 --> 38:41.736
that is the most awkward
team-up of the century.

38:43.116 --> 38:45.261
Actually, it wasn't
as bad as I expected.

38:45.286 --> 38:47.620
I learned a lot of
eye-opening things about her.

38:47.645 --> 38:50.554
That's for sure. Like her
being Lucifer's step-mom.

38:50.579 --> 38:52.075
- Had no idea...
- Wait a minute.

38:52.100 --> 38:54.679
She... step-mom?

38:54.816 --> 38:57.075
Yeah. Yes.

38:57.100 --> 39:00.018
That makes a weird
amount of sense, actually.

39:01.190 --> 39:03.624
Dan, I want you to be careful with her.

39:03.692 --> 39:05.622
There's something
about her I don't trust.

39:05.647 --> 39:07.691
I'm gonna be fine, Chloe.

39:09.219 --> 39:11.059
- Wait. One more thing.
- Yeah.

39:11.754 --> 39:13.759
If you married her,

39:14.169 --> 39:16.624
you'd kind of be like Lucifer's dad.

39:18.440 --> 39:19.905
- Oh, my God.
- Right?

39:19.930 --> 39:22.531
It's so, so messed up.

39:39.459 --> 39:41.195
I'm glad you agreed to meet me.

39:41.263 --> 39:43.130
Well, of course I did.

39:43.198 --> 39:46.742
I knew that book couldn't be it.

39:48.337 --> 39:49.503
Well, come on.

39:49.571 --> 39:53.320
Hand it over. I need
what Zeke really smuggled.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.647
Now.

40:00.249 --> 40:02.513
Mm. A knife.

40:03.252 --> 40:05.490
We already have...

40:07.723 --> 40:10.424
My life is ruined!

40:10.492 --> 40:12.326
I don't want to go to prison.

40:12.394 --> 40:13.794
This is all your fault!

40:52.047 --> 40:55.733
Who knew translating
could be so exhausting.

40:58.172 --> 41:00.282
Listen, I think I found something.

41:00.307 --> 41:01.506
Huh?

41:01.531 --> 41:05.094
God shattered the Flaming Sword
into three distinct pieces.

41:05.119 --> 41:06.701
"The Blade of Death."

41:06.726 --> 41:08.026
Azrael's.

41:08.051 --> 41:09.699
"The Medallion of Life."

41:09.724 --> 41:12.086
Johnson's belt buckle.

41:12.402 --> 41:15.322
And the key that binds
them all together.

41:17.426 --> 41:20.490
Well, keys don't bind, they unlock.

41:20.515 --> 41:23.336
I think someone needs to go
back to translation school.

41:26.608 --> 41:28.926
And guess who has the key.

41:32.250 --> 41:33.749
Well, don't leave me in suspense.

41:33.809 --> 41:34.942
Who is it, brother?

41:35.010 --> 41:36.677
It says that God entrusted the key

41:36.745 --> 41:38.943
to his favorite son.

41:42.971 --> 41:45.471
Of course he gave it to you.

41:46.621 --> 41:48.609
It's always you, isn't it?

41:48.634 --> 41:49.878
Well, what are you talking about?

41:49.902 --> 41:51.487
The only keys I've got are these.

41:53.452 --> 41:56.128
What else did you bring
with you to Earth, Luci?

41:57.379 --> 41:58.891
Your ring.

41:59.069 --> 42:01.903
I've never seen you without
it; maybe that's the key.

42:01.928 --> 42:04.563
Well, the key to completing
my ensemble maybe.

42:04.588 --> 42:06.193
Here.

42:06.218 --> 42:08.787
Try and attach your ring to this.

42:08.854 --> 42:10.355
- Brother.
- Just do it.

42:10.423 --> 42:11.868
And we'll confirm what we already know.

42:11.892 --> 42:13.785
- Brother...
- That Father's favorite,

42:13.810 --> 42:15.178
despite everything that you have done,

42:15.202 --> 42:17.327
is and always has been you.

42:17.496 --> 42:18.811
Look down.

42:23.336 --> 42:25.087
Is that the key around your neck

42:25.112 --> 42:27.313
or are you just happy to see me?

42:31.948 --> 42:33.976
He entrusted it...

42:35.385 --> 42:37.839
to you, brother.
