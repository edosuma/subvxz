FATHER:
<i>Don't forget to be home early.</i>

00:12.154 --> 00:13.554
I'm having the entire board

00:13.556 --> 00:15.589
of directors from the lab
over for dinner, remember?

00:15.591 --> 00:16.623
Don't worry, Dad.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.392
It has top priority on my sched.

00:18.394 --> 00:19.826
Honey, are these
the same board members

00:19.828 --> 00:22.729
I don't <i>always</i>
<i>complain about them.</i>

00:22.731 --> 00:25.399
I mean, sure, Dr. Cook
is a bit of a know-it-all,

00:25.401 --> 00:27.401
and Dr. Harris's toupee
looks like roadkill,

00:27.403 --> 00:29.503

tells one more pointless

00:29.505 --> 00:31.772
story about "the old country,"
so help me, I'll...

00:31.774 --> 00:34.708
Maybe you should skip
the coffee today, Dad.

00:34.710 --> 00:36.276
Heh. Sorry, Kimmy.

00:36.278 --> 00:39.079
I'm as nervous as a porcupine
in a balloon factory.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.781
Hon, you're a shoe-in
for the promotion.

00:40.783 --> 00:43.350
But we've never had the big
bosses over to the house before.

00:43.352 --> 00:45.519
Don't worry. We'll be
on our best behavior.

00:45.521 --> 00:46.486
Right, kids?

00:46.488 --> 00:48.488
Hey, talk
to the tweebs, not me.

<i>Hola, Possible clan.</i>

00:51.560 --> 00:52.826
Kim, ready to hit it?

00:52.828 --> 00:54.861
I can't believe I'm going
to be on the cover

00:54.863 --> 00:57.264

I am so freaking.

01:00.369 --> 01:01.835
You'll be fine.
My advice...

01:01.837 --> 01:04.171
just be totally
and completely sincere.

01:04.173 --> 01:06.873
Hey, that's
actually good advice.

01:06.875 --> 01:08.508
That's not something
I practice myself,

01:08.510 --> 01:09.810
but I think you
can pull it off.

01:09.812 --> 01:10.877

01:10.879 --> 01:12.546
Hey, Wade. What's the sitch?

01:12.548 --> 01:15.215
Kim, think you can squeeze in
a rescue before homeroom?

01:15.217 --> 01:16.717
You got transportation?

01:18.720 --> 01:19.686

WADE:

Drakken captured her
and took her

01:27.496 --> 01:29.296
to some kind of ice fortress.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.198
Has he done
the underwater layer yet?

01:31.200 --> 01:32.165
See, if it was me,

01:32.167 --> 01:33.166
I would have gone

01:33.168 --> 01:34.468
with underwater before ice.

01:34.470 --> 01:35.569
Ready to eject?

01:35.571 --> 01:37.204
Yes.
Good.

01:43.845 --> 01:45.545
Cold, Dr. Wong?

01:45.547 --> 01:46.713
Why am I sitting

01:46.715 --> 01:47.681
on an ice cube?

01:47.683 --> 01:50.150
So you will divulge
every detail

01:50.152 --> 01:52.786
of your top-secret
projects, that's why.

01:52.788 --> 01:54.354
You make no sense to me.

01:54.356 --> 01:57.257
Welcome to my life.

01:57.259 --> 02:00.327
Oh, a little
more glutial discomfort

02:00.329 --> 02:03.597
and you'll be Little
Miss Busy Lips.

02:03.599 --> 02:05.265
I still don't get the ice.

02:05.267 --> 02:07.567
Grr. Fine, forget the ice!

02:07.569 --> 02:10.771
You leave me no choice

02:19.682 --> 02:22.449
Ice the sass, Shego.

02:36.931 --> 02:38.465
Don't worry,
we're the good guys,

03:29.650 --> 03:31.351
What's she doing?

Trying to make us dizzy?

03:32.988 --> 03:34.955
No, worse.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.436
WOMAN: Whoo! That's going to
be a great cover shot, Kim.

03:49.438 --> 03:50.604
Now, I just need to ask you

03:50.606 --> 03:52.305
a couple of questions
for the article.

03:52.307 --> 03:53.306
Now, I understand

03:53.308 --> 03:56.510
in addition to cheering

03:56.512 --> 03:57.778
and being on the honor roll,

03:57.780 --> 04:00.380
somebody also saves the world

04:00.382 --> 04:01.948
from time to time, hmm?

04:01.950 --> 04:03.850
Oh, you know. No big.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.051
Well, I know our readers

04:05.053 --> 04:06.686
are going to want to know this:

04:06.688 --> 04:08.455
Do you have time
for a personal life?

04:08.457 --> 04:09.823
Oh, I make time.

04:09.825 --> 04:12.359
I'll bet you're crushing
on someone right now.

04:12.361 --> 04:13.593
Give us a hint.

04:13.595 --> 04:14.761
His name is Bobby Johnson.

04:14.763 --> 04:16.296
Just moved here from Upperton,

04:16.298 --> 04:18.465
but I'm not sure if I like him
because I like him

04:18.467 --> 04:20.500
or because he asked out
Bonnie first. ( <i>gasps</i> )

04:20.502 --> 04:21.501
I knew it.

04:21.503 --> 04:24.771
Well, that's some hint!

04:24.773 --> 04:25.939
Any cool hobbies?

04:25.941 --> 04:27.574
Oh, nothing special.

04:27.576 --> 04:29.676
I collect cuddle buddies.
I love them.

04:29.678 --> 04:31.745
I can't get to sleep
without my pandaroo.

04:31.747 --> 04:33.680
( <i>laughing</i> )

04:33.682 --> 04:36.616
Cuddle buddies? Yeah...

04:36.618 --> 04:38.852
Kim, I have to be
honest with you.

04:38.854 --> 04:40.654
We like our cover girls

04:40.656 --> 04:43.390
to be, ooh, how
shall I put this?

04:43.392 --> 04:44.991
Um... trend-forward.

04:44.993 --> 04:49.396
There must be some <i>other</i>
<i>activity that you do regularly.</i>

04:49.398 --> 04:50.630
I pick my nose
when nobody's looking.

04:50.632 --> 04:52.465
( <i>stifled mumbling</i>)

04:52.467 --> 04:54.100
Anyone else want
to be on the cover?

04:54.102 --> 04:56.336
Ooh-ooh! I do, I do! Me.

04:56.971 --> 04:58.038
Okay, Kim,

04:58.040 --> 05:00.674
just tell yourself
a big, fat lie.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.042
You can do it.

05:02.044 --> 05:07.347
The color of my hair
is greee... red.

05:07.349 --> 05:08.715
My name is Possible.

05:08.717 --> 05:10.016
The sky is blue.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.552
Pro-wrestling is... fake.

05:12.554 --> 05:13.620
No!

05:13.622 --> 05:15.856
Wade, something's
wrong with me.

05:15.858 --> 05:17.591
I can only
tell the truth and, and...

05:17.593 --> 05:19.359
you spend too much time
in your room.

05:19.361 --> 05:20.694
It's just not healthy.

05:20.696 --> 05:22.696
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:22.698 --> 05:26.766
Okay, Kim, I'll disregard that
until we figure out what's up.

05:26.768 --> 05:27.767
Hold the communicator

05:27.769 --> 05:28.969
at arm's length.

05:28.971 --> 05:31.705
Scanning for weirdness.

05:31.707 --> 05:32.706
Well?

05:32.708 --> 05:33.907
Way weird.

05:33.909 --> 05:35.108
It looks like all of your

05:35.110 --> 05:36.910
brain inhibitors are shut down.

05:36.912 --> 05:38.011
Meaning?

05:38.013 --> 05:39.145
Meaning you can't lie.

05:39.147 --> 05:41.147
You can only
blurt out the truth.

05:41.149 --> 05:43.149
Now let's look back
at the last 24 hours.

05:43.151 --> 05:44.918
The usual. Got up,
went to school.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.152
Fought Shego. Drakken zapped me

05:46.154 --> 05:48.021
with some funky ray thing.

05:48.023 --> 05:50.790
Don't know.
It was yellow, I think.

05:50.792 --> 05:51.992
A truth ray.

05:51.994 --> 05:53.526
That's got to be it. ( <i>gasps</i> )

05:53.528 --> 05:55.562
If I was hit,
I'll bet Ron was hit, too.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.597
There's no telling
what kind of trouble

05:57.599 --> 05:58.798
he's getting himself into.

05:58.800 --> 05:59.933
All right, people.

05:59.935 --> 06:01.668
I assume you all read

06:01.670 --> 06:04.037
and are prepared to discuss
the classic novella,

06:04.039 --> 06:06.806
"Lo, The Plow Shall Till
the Soil of Redemption."

06:06.808 --> 06:10.443
I did not and I am not!

06:11.646 --> 06:13.046
Wait. No.

06:13.048 --> 06:15.548
What I meant to say
is that I read...

06:15.550 --> 06:17.550
only the first three pages!

06:17.552 --> 06:18.852
I almost dislocated
my jaw from yawning!

06:18.854 --> 06:19.886
Stoppable!

06:19.888 --> 06:21.821
Explain yourself.

06:21.823 --> 06:23.890
This book is snobby,
pompous, overwritten,

06:23.892 --> 06:26.159
and the pictures were
in black and white.

06:26.161 --> 06:28.194
Excuse me,
Mr. Barken,

06:28.196 --> 06:31.598
but I agree
with Ron's criticism.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.633
Yeah. Me too. Um...

06:33.635 --> 06:36.603
I just didn't have the guts
to slam your favorite book.

06:36.605 --> 06:37.971
Uh-huh. Yeah. That's right.

06:37.973 --> 06:41.975
That's it! I've had it
with this book.

06:41.977 --> 06:44.477
I've despised
"Lo, the Plow Shall Till

06:44.479 --> 06:47.881
the Soil of Redemption" ever
since I had to suffer through it

06:47.883 --> 06:49.516
back in military school.

06:49.518 --> 06:51.484
KIDS:
Yeah! Yeah!

06:51.486 --> 06:53.019
Ron! Ron! Ron!

06:53.021 --> 06:56.456
Ron! Ron! Ron! Ron! Ron!

06:56.458 --> 06:57.757
And you know what else?

06:57.759 --> 06:59.159
I've never kissed a girl.

06:59.161 --> 07:01.728
Well, except for the CPR
dummy in health class.

07:01.730 --> 07:04.030
Now, I know it's not the coolest
thing to admit,

07:04.032 --> 07:05.598
but, hey, the truth
sets you free.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.933
Dude,

07:06.935 --> 07:08.468
you tell it straight up.

07:08.470 --> 07:11.071
Ron, listen. We were both
hit with a truth ray and...

07:11.073 --> 07:12.572
No diggity. Isn't it great?

07:12.574 --> 07:13.974
Great?
Hey, Penny.

07:13.976 --> 07:16.676
You have the most
beautilicious eyes in school.

07:16.678 --> 07:17.711
Gosh, thanks, Ron.

07:17.713 --> 07:18.979
That's so sweet.

07:18.981 --> 07:21.715
Hey, I'll see you around, okay?

07:21.717 --> 07:22.716
I tell it like it is.

07:22.718 --> 07:24.017
Ain't no shame in my game.

07:24.019 --> 07:24.918
This rules.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.119
( <i>tonal beeping</i> )

07:26.121 --> 07:27.587
What's the truth sitch, Wade?

07:27.589 --> 07:28.922
According to my research,

07:28.924 --> 07:31.191
the effects of the truth ray
should wear off

07:31.193 --> 07:33.193
in about a day.

07:33.195 --> 07:34.594
( <i>school bell ringing</i>)

07:34.596 --> 07:36.162
This is so my worst nightmare.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.597
My worst nightmare is the one

07:37.599 --> 07:39.499
where I'm in school
in my underwear. Ron,

07:39.501 --> 07:40.667
you've actually done that.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.268
I have to get home
and tell Mom and Dad

07:42.270 --> 07:44.537
before his big-shot
bosses get there.

07:45.506 --> 07:46.606
Mom, Dad.

07:46.608 --> 07:48.041
I gotta talk to you before...

07:48.043 --> 07:49.876
Dr. Cook, Dr. Harris,
Dr. Kramer.

07:49.878 --> 07:51.044
You've met the twins.

07:51.046 --> 07:52.212
This is my Kimmy Cup.

07:52.214 --> 07:53.913
I hate it when
he calls me that.

07:53.915 --> 07:55.515
( <i>gasps</i> )

07:55.517 --> 07:57.050
( <i>gasps</i>)

07:57.052 --> 07:59.119
Aren't you just
the prettiest thing?

07:59.121 --> 08:01.221
I have split ends
and I'm trying to cover

08:01.223 --> 08:04.090
a mountain-size zit on my cheek
that you just touched.

08:04.092 --> 08:06.826
Teenagers. Always
playing us squares.

08:06.828 --> 08:09.729
Why don't we adjourn
to the living room

08:09.731 --> 08:12.832
while we wait for the chairman
of the board to arrive, hmm?

08:12.834 --> 08:14.734
( <i>sighs</i> )

08:14.736 --> 08:18.905
And after churning
and churning and churning,

08:18.907 --> 08:20.607
my great-great grandpapa

08:20.609 --> 08:23.043
finally made
the first goat butter

08:23.045 --> 08:24.844
his village had ever seen.

08:24.846 --> 08:26.813
Wow. What a
captivating story.

08:26.815 --> 08:27.947
Wasn't it guys?

08:27.949 --> 08:29.716
Oh, very.

08:29.718 --> 08:30.884
( <i>yawns</i> ):
Cool.

08:30.886 --> 08:31.985
Yeah.

08:31.987 --> 08:35.622
( <i>muffled mumbling</i> )

08:35.624 --> 08:37.157
Kim?

08:37.159 --> 08:38.158
Uh-uh.

08:38.160 --> 08:39.159
We'll get it.

08:39.161 --> 08:41.761
Kimmy, What is wrong with you?

08:41.763 --> 08:43.630
KIM: I'm trying not
to tell Dr. Kramer

08:43.632 --> 08:44.731
that you were right.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.299
His stories
about the old country...

08:46.301 --> 08:48.134
they're pointless snore fests.

08:48.136 --> 08:50.603
Goat butter is not pointless.

08:50.605 --> 08:52.205
It is delicious.

08:55.142 --> 08:56.843
Interestingly,
in ancient Syria,

08:56.845 --> 08:59.012
they would use a goatskin sack.

08:59.014 --> 09:00.580
Dad, you were right
about Dr. Cook, too.

09:00.582 --> 09:01.948
He <i>is</i> a know-it-all.

09:01.950 --> 09:04.217
Oh, my hair!

09:04.219 --> 09:06.019
Don't worry. My father
already spilled

09:06.021 --> 09:07.720
about your bad piece,
even if he didn't...

09:07.722 --> 09:12.592
trust me, aliens could
spot that thing from space.

09:12.594 --> 09:13.626
Kim!
Kim!

09:13.628 --> 09:14.627
She's funnier
without the pillow.

09:14.629 --> 09:16.296
Hoo-sha!

09:16.298 --> 09:18.231
That's it. Grab your coats.

09:18.233 --> 09:20.300
We are leaving this instant.

09:22.870 --> 09:24.904
Dr. Possible, see
me in my office

09:24.906 --> 09:26.139
first thing tomorrow.

09:26.141 --> 09:28.641
We need to discuss
your future at the lab,

09:28.643 --> 09:30.743
or lack thereof.

09:31.612 --> 09:32.712
Wait. You
can't do that.

09:32.714 --> 09:33.980
It's not my dad's fault.

09:33.982 --> 09:35.281
I got hit with a truth ray.

09:35.283 --> 09:36.649
I'm sorry.

09:36.651 --> 09:37.784
Ha! Truth ray.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.053
Absurd.

09:41.822 --> 09:43.089
The board chairman.

09:43.091 --> 09:45.291
Now my career
is completely over.

09:46.694 --> 09:47.694
Dr. Wong?

09:47.696 --> 09:49.095
Kim! I can't
thank you enough

09:49.097 --> 09:50.296
for your help today.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.698
Thanks to you,

09:51.700 --> 09:53.766
I narrowly escaped
that nasty Drakken

09:53.768 --> 09:57.170
There really <i>was</i> a truth ray?

09:57.172 --> 09:59.739
I saved her. I
save lots of people.

09:59.741 --> 10:00.940
Of course you do.

10:00.942 --> 10:02.642
You were brilliant.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.844
Like daughter, like
father, right doctors?

10:04.846 --> 10:05.845
Oh, of course.

10:05.847 --> 10:07.213
I couldn't agree more.

10:07.215 --> 10:08.748
It's an entire family

10:08.750 --> 10:09.816
of geniuses.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.084
Now, let's
get inside and discuss

10:11.086 --> 10:14.187
RON:
<i>So everything worked out?</i>

10:14.189 --> 10:16.723
KIM: <i>Totally. I apologized
to the board members</i>

10:16.725 --> 10:18.191
and, like, a zillion
other people.

10:18.193 --> 10:19.826
How about you?

10:19.828 --> 10:22.262
I'm still mourning
the loss of my truth mojo.

10:22.264 --> 10:24.063
You could just be
honest on your own.

10:24.065 --> 10:25.832
Believe me, I'm trying.

10:25.834 --> 10:26.833
Hi, Ron.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.101
Hey, Penny.

10:28.103 --> 10:29.836
You-you have, you
have the most,

10:29.838 --> 10:31.171
the most, um, you got

10:31.173 --> 10:32.872
the most cans in the school's

10:32.874 --> 10:33.873
charity can drive.

10:33.875 --> 10:36.209
Keep up the good work, Tiger.

10:36.211 --> 10:38.044
Wait! I didn't hear

10:38.046 --> 10:40.079
any complaints
from the CPR dummy.
