WEBVTT

00:03.800 --> 00:06.689
I was the same way.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.230
Bad things just happen.

00:08.270 --> 00:10.204
No rhyme or reason.

00:10.240 --> 00:13.038
But sometimes there is a reason.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.537
It's just not a reason
you can see.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.673
Mm. This is wonderful.
You have to give me the recipe.

00:17.710 --> 00:20.076
Thank you.
I may not see
the air is polluted,

00:20.120 --> 00:22.543
but that_ doesn't mean
It's not.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.808
I may not see
the poison in the ground,

00:24.850 --> 00:26.488
but it's still there.

00:26.520 --> 00:29.057
WOMAN:
I went to Alicia

00:29.090 --> 00:30.580
because we didn't cause this,
Lori.

00:30.630 --> 00:31.779
This was done to us.

00:31.830 --> 00:33.718
So do you have
any questions?

00:33.760 --> 00:35.159
Who else signed up?

00:35.200 --> 00:39.466
The pesticides were buried
here and here.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.058
102 families affected in all.

00:41.100 --> 00:42.658
I've spoken to half so far,

00:42.710 --> 00:45.167
and I'll speak to the rest
by the end of the week.

00:45.210 --> 00:47.235
And what happens if I do sign?

00:47.280 --> 00:51.705
Then we'll bring suit
to JNL Pesticides.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.479
They were negligent.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.771
They could have disposed
of their chlordane reserves

00:54.820 --> 00:58.540
properly;
instead they buried them

00:58.590 --> 00:59.818
near your groundwater.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.418
This won't _cost
you anything.

01:01.460 --> 01:04.429
My firm only makes money
if we're successful.

01:08.900 --> 01:12.461
You can come.

01:17.510 --> 01:20.502
I wanted
three girls.

01:20.540 --> 01:22.098
I was an only child,

01:22.150 --> 01:24.471
and I wanted...
noise in the house.

01:24.510 --> 01:27.149
Lots of noise.

01:28.880 --> 01:33.658
I'm 26 years old,
and I will never have a baby.

01:33.690 --> 01:35.419
Neven

01:35.460 --> 01:37.348
Are you a mom?
Yes, I am.

01:37.390 --> 01:39.153
If you're planning

01:39.200 --> 01:41.327
to sue these people,
I'll do whatever you want.

01:41.360 --> 01:43.191
I'll testify wherever you want,

01:43.230 --> 01:45.824
cry whenever you want,
but it's not for the money.

01:45.870 --> 01:49.431
I want them to know
they hurt me.

01:49.470 --> 01:52.837
Okay?
Okay.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.700
(phone ringing)

01:54.740 --> 01:56.401
Would you excuse me?

02:01.480 --> 02:02.686
She's a good one.

02:02.720 --> 02:05.541
I know.

02:05.590 --> 02:06.909
(phone rings)

02:06.960 --> 02:08.279
Yeah?

02:08.320 --> 02:10.220
How's it going?

02:10.260 --> 02:12.558
Good but slow.
Everybody's wary here.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.454
They'll climb on board
when they smell the money.

02:15.460 --> 02:17.428
I don't think so.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.233
It's a conservative
neighborhood.

02:19.270 --> 02:20.931
They don't like lawyers.

02:20.970 --> 02:22.130
That's why I sent you.

02:22.170 --> 02:25.901
We got the preliminary report
back on the core samples.

02:25.940 --> 02:28.204
It's looking like
this could reach pretty high.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.741
$55 million.

02:29.780 --> 02:30.906
You're kidding.

02:30.950 --> 02:33.874
Nope. You're going to change
a lot of lives out there.

02:33.920 --> 02:34.944
Just keep signing them up.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.618
Call me when you're done.

02:36.650 --> 02:38.413
What did she say?

02:38.450 --> 02:39.883
She says we're good.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.650
How sweet.
You two have made up.

02:42.690 --> 02:44.954
Isn't it adorable?
So, are you on board?

02:44.990 --> 02:46.799
If it means getting Bond out,
I am.

02:46.830 --> 02:48.889
Otherwise, I am out the door
headed to another firm.

02:48.930 --> 02:50.727
It's about getting Bond out.

02:50.770 --> 02:52.965
There's only one way
to replace a name partner--

02:53.000 --> 02:54.297
a majority vote
of the equity partners.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.262
The next partner
meeting is Friday.

02:56.310 --> 03:00.235
Bond thinks I'm on his side,
so he won't expect anything.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.407
And then Diane asks for
and end-of-the-meeting
good faith vote.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.974
DIANE:
Bond will think I'm
just being spiteful.

03:04.010 --> 03:06.217
So he won't _have time
to line up hIS troops.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.343
(chuckles)
And you have the votes?

03:08.380 --> 03:11.315
Well, we have my people,
Will's people and yours, right?

03:11.350 --> 03:15.411
Family Law's? Sure,
they're ready to lynch him.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.223
An unfortunate
choice of words.

03:17.260 --> 03:18.989
We need to get
Julius into this

03:19.030 --> 03:21.248
so it doesn't look like
the racist white partners...

03:21.300 --> 03:22.494
Oh, please.

03:22.530 --> 03:23.724
What do you mean, oh, please?

03:23.770 --> 03:25.260
I'm worried we're soft
on four votes:

03:25.300 --> 03:26.892
Wolf, Adams, Howard, Neka.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.396
Minus those four votes,

03:28.440 --> 03:29.737
we're short of a majority.

03:29.770 --> 03:31.567
So we get them
back on the reservation.

03:31.610 --> 03:33.271
Back on the reservation?

03:33.310 --> 03:34.277
Isn't Neka half Cherokee?

03:34.310 --> 03:35.902
Look, the only thing

03:35.940 --> 03:38.500
equity partners care about
is year-end bonuses.

03:38.550 --> 03:41.269
So we need to give them a piece
of this new class action.

03:41.320 --> 03:44.619
$55 million
is a lot of incentive.

03:44.650 --> 03:47.312
Are you sure the $55 million
is real?

03:47.360 --> 03:48.349
It's a consent form, Julie.

03:48.390 --> 03:49.755
Just a formality

03:49.790 --> 03:51.018
for the court.

03:51.060 --> 03:53.858
I like you,
Mrs. Florrick.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.720
But that was my friend
Gail on the phone.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.024
She thinks I should listen
to this other lawyer

03:58.070 --> 03:59.367
before I decide.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.697
What other lavwer?

04:01.740 --> 04:03.002
At Annette's house.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.007
Right now?

04:07.010 --> 04:08.898
Do you mind if we tag along?

04:14.750 --> 04:17.241
ALICIA:
Looks like we have competition.

04:18.490 --> 04:20.708
I don't know who it is.

04:23.360 --> 04:24.827
False alarm.

04:24.860 --> 04:27.021
The other firm sent
a car and driver.

04:27.060 --> 04:27.992
Talk about tone-deaf.

04:28.030 --> 04:29.622
This community's
gonna hate him.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.365
(chuckles)

04:31.400 --> 04:32.867
WOMAN:
I just don't like the feeling

04:32.900 --> 04:34.060
we're being exploited,
that's all.

04:34.100 --> 04:35.067
(people agreeing)

04:35.100 --> 04:37.307
CANNING:
There are a lot
of lawyers out there

04:37.340 --> 04:39.035
just looking
to make a quick buck.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.038
But I know what it's like
to be exploited.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.379
People see you as a victim,
and they want to use that.

04:44.410 --> 04:45.843
They don't see pain

04:45.880 --> 04:48.019
unless it's something
that can packaged and sold.

04:48.050 --> 04:50.848
Look at me.

04:50.890 --> 04:52.039
(group chuckles)

04:52.090 --> 04:54.809
Oh, hi, Julie, Rosanna.

04:54.860 --> 04:56.088
And Mrs. Florrick.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.883
JULIE:
She asked if she
could drop by, too.

04:57.930 --> 05:00.023
Now, now, don't want any
lawyer fights in here.

05:00.060 --> 05:04.326
No, no. Mrs. Florrick
and I are old friends.

05:04.370 --> 05:05.826
Aren't we?
We are.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.929
ANNETTE:
Lours was just
telling us he has...

05:07.970 --> 05:09.335
CANNING:
Tardive dyskinesia.

05:09.370 --> 05:10.735
It's a neurological syndrome.

05:10.770 --> 05:11.964
If you see me moving

05:12.010 --> 05:14.103
like this or like this,

05:14.140 --> 05:16.779
don't think Ms. Florrick
has me worried.

05:16.810 --> 05:18.505
(laughter)
In fact, I'm glad
Alicia's here.

05:18.550 --> 05:20.472
I know I should
probably be telling you

05:20.520 --> 05:22.112
she's the devil incarnate,

05:22.150 --> 05:24.084
and her firm is going to
screw up your class action,

05:24.120 --> 05:26.350
but we're both very
capable lavwers,

05:26.390 --> 05:28.449
and I think you should
just go with the firm

05:28.490 --> 05:31.027
that you think has your
best interests at heart.

05:31.060 --> 05:33.995
And who is your firm these days,
Mr. Canning?

05:34.030 --> 05:35.395
Well, that would be me.

05:35.430 --> 05:38.126
I'm it. One employee.

05:38.170 --> 05:39.660
Low overhead.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.429
(laughter)

05:41.470 --> 05:42.801
This crumb cake is incredible.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.000
And the town car
and driver outside,

05:44.040 --> 05:46.031
who pays his salary?

05:47.180 --> 05:49.603
I guess I do.

05:49.650 --> 05:53.643
I... I can't drive anymore.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.113
I wish I could, but...
(sympathetic murmurs)

05:55.150 --> 05:56.947
I need that,
to have a driver.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.139
ANNETTE:
That's okay.

05:58.190 --> 06:00.488
My brother was in an
accident last year.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.920
A taxi ran over his leg.
He can't drive either.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.428
That's terrible.

06:05.460 --> 06:07.690
This is what I love about

06:07.730 --> 06:10.597
coming into homes like this--
is the acceptance.

06:10.630 --> 06:13.428
This is what America has
more than any other country--

06:13.470 --> 06:15.597
acceptance.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.562
(group agreeing)
WOMAN:
He's right...

06:20.510 --> 06:22.944
So you're working for
the pesticide industry now.

06:22.980 --> 06:24.402
Why would you say that?

06:24.450 --> 06:25.644
History.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.113
Last time we met,

06:27.150 --> 06:29.482
you gloated about helping
big pharmaceutical.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.148
Yes, and you defended the
wife-killer Colin Sweeny.

06:32.190 --> 06:36.650
So you save JNL money
by stealing our class action

06:36.690 --> 06:39.921
and negotiating
a lowball settlement.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.428
Very smart.

06:42.470 --> 06:45.496
Mrs. Florrick, you seem
like such a nice woman

06:45.530 --> 06:47.191
on the outside, and
then I get this glimpse

06:47.240 --> 06:49.800
of the darkness within.
(laughing)

06:49.840 --> 06:51.467
You're going to have

06:51.510 --> 06:53.205
to try harder this time around.
I'm on to you.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.730
It helped you in there.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.475
They loved it when
you attacked my car.

06:56.510 --> 06:59.149
There can only be
one class action.

06:59.180 --> 07:02.581
Yes. I'll see you in court.

07:05.020 --> 07:06.578
(crowd cheering on TV,
woman laughing)

07:06.620 --> 07:07.814
(phone ringing)

07:07.860 --> 07:09.054
WOMAN:
No! No!

07:09.090 --> 07:10.887
WILL:
Yes.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.899
Just consider it foreplay.
Well, then you
have to find it.

07:13.930 --> 07:16.228
Yeah, what's up?

07:16.260 --> 07:19.559
"Oh, I have this
deposition..."
Shh, shh.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.238
"Then_ there's this
continuance..."
Well, don't worry about it.

07:21.270 --> 07:23.568
The judge will never...

07:26.110 --> 07:27.737
(whispers):
No, no.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.771
All right, I'll be right in.

07:32.050 --> 07:35.110
You know what I think?
I think you're gay.

07:35.150 --> 07:37.516
I think your
gay lover phones

07:37.550 --> 07:40.553
every time we're about
to have sex and calls you away.

07:40.590 --> 07:41.454
Oh, yeah?

07:41.490 --> 07:43.458
I'll have you two over
for dinner sometime.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.121
(yells)

07:46.160 --> 07:47.127
BAILIFF:
All rise.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.127
Good morning.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.923
And welcome.
(gavel pounds)

07:49.970 --> 07:51.790
Uh, before we begin today,

07:51.830 --> 07:54.799
I want to remind everybody
about the...

07:54.840 --> 07:56.637
* Dum-da-da-dum,
blood drive.

07:56.670 --> 07:59.138
I don't want to hand down

07:59.170 --> 08:01.673
any declarations,
but blood supplies

08:01.710 --> 08:04.873
are low, so I leave it to you
and your conscience.

08:04.910 --> 08:09.540
Now, I understand that
we have a disagreement

08:09.590 --> 08:11.512
over a class certification.

08:11.550 --> 08:14.053
Ms. Lockhart, you are looking
formidable today?

08:14.090 --> 08:15.580
Yes, Your Honor.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.520
We represent the community
of Fallstrom

08:17.560 --> 08:20.028
_ in their suit_ _
against JNL PestICIdes,

08:20.060 --> 08:22.722
over a recent infertility
and miscarriage cluster,

08:22.770 --> 08:24.795
and we're asking you
to certify our class.

08:24.830 --> 08:27.298
And yet there seems to be
an overlapping contention.

08:27.340 --> 08:31.208
Mr. Canni-- Canning, is it?

08:31.240 --> 08:32.309
Yes, Your Honor.

08:32.340 --> 08:33.807
Hello.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.068
Hi.
Being new to your court,

08:35.110 --> 08:36.577
I should probably
explain a few things.

08:36.610 --> 08:39.204
This movement that you see,

08:39.250 --> 08:42.139
I have a syndrome
called tardive dyskinesia,

08:42.180 --> 08:45.809
and it results in these
uncontrollable movements.

08:45.850 --> 08:47.215
That's good to know.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.626
My sister-in-law suffers
from Huntington's.

08:49.660 --> 08:51.082
Huntington's.
Oh, my gosh.

08:51.130 --> 08:52.654
Yes, it requires

08:52.700 --> 08:53.758
a bravery
that I couldn't imagine.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.098
I commend you, sir,
for even being in this court.

08:56.130 --> 08:57.267
Oh, no, please...

08:57.300 --> 08:58.995
One foot in front
of the other.

08:59.030 --> 09:00.338
I very much doubt that.

09:00.370 --> 09:03.066
Oh, dear God.
And so you want

09:03.110 --> 09:04.907
to represent this
class, is that right?

09:04.940 --> 09:07.170
Yes, I've signed up
several of the neighbors

09:07.210 --> 09:08.837
in Fallstrom,
and I believe I'll be

09:08.880 --> 09:10.802
the strongest advocate
in the case against JNL.

09:10.850 --> 09:13.011
Your Honor,
until very recently,

09:13.050 --> 09:17.146
Mr. Canning was in-house counsel
at MRG Pharmaceuticals.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.317
For the last eight years,

09:19.350 --> 09:21.318
he successfully defeated
class actions

09:21.360 --> 09:22.850
identical to this one.

09:22.890 --> 09:26.656
It is our contention
that he is a Trojan horse

09:26.700 --> 09:29.191
helping to certify
this class

09:29.230 --> 09:30.265
in order to destroy it.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.858
So, Mr. Canning,
is that true?

09:31.900 --> 09:33.697
Are you a Trojan horse?

09:33.740 --> 09:36.163
Well, I definitely like being
compared to anyone in Homer.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.838
But, no, sir.

09:37.870 --> 09:40.304
For the last eight years,
it's true, I have worked against

09:40.340 --> 09:41.830
people like Lockhart/Gardner

09:41.880 --> 09:43.848
and worked to demolish
class actions like this one,

09:43.880 --> 09:46.201
and I was paid
handsomely for it.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.639
But six months ago I quit.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.887
I sold my stock options

09:50.920 --> 09:54.185
and I went out on my own because
I saw the error of my ways.

09:54.220 --> 09:56.688
I'm here representing myself
as an advocate for this class

09:56.730 --> 09:58.721
precisely because I used
to be on the other side.

09:58.760 --> 10:01.729
Well, uh, I can only certify
one class,

10:01.760 --> 10:04.797
so the members of the losing
class will join the ranks

10:04.830 --> 10:09.199
of the winning and the losing
lawyers... or lavwer

10:09.240 --> 10:10.229
will be dismissed.

10:10.270 --> 10:12.135
So, in four days time,

10:12.170 --> 10:13.831
I would like both law firms
to return

10:13.880 --> 10:15.632
and whichever has the most
members in their class

10:15.680 --> 10:16.840
will be certified.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.700
That's, uh, that's all.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.377
(gavel pounds)

10:20.420 --> 10:23.639
Oh, and don't forget,
if you're a blood owner,

10:23.690 --> 10:26.341
become a...

10:26.390 --> 10:28.085
OTHERS:
Blood donor.

10:29.190 --> 10:30.384
Where are we?

10:30.430 --> 10:32.386
We're up by
six households.

10:32.430 --> 10:34.159
Our life is numbers
these days.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.997
Okay, $55 million depends
on getting signatures,

10:36.030 --> 10:37.668
so let's go.

10:38.970 --> 10:42.906
Captioning sponsored by
CBS

10:51.450 --> 10:52.405
We're broke.

10:52.450 --> 10:54.372
We have cash on hand

10:54.420 --> 10:56.342
for three staff members
through the election.

10:56.380 --> 10:58.109
(chuckles)

10:58.150 --> 11:00.152
Yeah, that's the story
of my life.

11:00.190 --> 11:03.159
Always recruited
by the losing team.

11:03.190 --> 11:06.182
Yes, but we're the underdogs;
we're hard to dislike.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.425
(chuckles)
And why do I get the call?

11:08.460 --> 11:10.860
How have I shown myself
deserving?

11:10.900 --> 11:12.936
We heard you quit Eisner &
Gowan, Wendy's polling firm.

11:12.970 --> 11:14.767
So we naturally assumed
that you were unhappy.

11:14.800 --> 11:18.065
We need a cheap pollster, and we
thought you'd like the chance

11:18.110 --> 11:20.101
to get back at them.

11:20.140 --> 11:23.439
Okay.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.107
They were lying to her,

11:25.150 --> 11:27.414
telling her she had
the youth vote sewn up.

11:27.450 --> 11:30.146
And she doesn't?
Mm-mmm.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.442
Are you saying that she's weak
on the youth vote?

11:32.490 --> 11:34.708
No. You're strong.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.820
See, I was doing a focus group
during the last debate.

11:37.860 --> 11:40.249
You were just bumping
along in the low 205.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.097
And then you swore, and-- boom.

11:42.130 --> 11:44.428
I mean, not with
the 55-year-olds,

11:44.470 --> 11:46.222
but the under 305.

11:46.270 --> 11:48.830
It was like watching
a baby chick's eyes open.

11:48.870 --> 11:50.963
You shot to low-70$
and you stayed there.

11:51.010 --> 11:52.204
Kids thought it was honest.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.935
But it's the youth vote.

11:53.980 --> 11:57.199
Yeah, yeah, and they never
show up, right?

11:58.280 --> 11:59.406
Except. . .

11:59.450 --> 12:00.519
Yep.

12:00.550 --> 12:02.017
The new ballot measure.

12:02.050 --> 12:03.187
Medical marijuana.

12:03.220 --> 12:05.882
The youth vote is showing up
to vote for Amendment 31.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.286
We need to stop running away
from prison.

12:08.320 --> 12:11.027
See, Wendy gets points
because she's black,

12:11.060 --> 12:13.324
but she's like Donna Reed black.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.191
You've been to prison.

12:15.230 --> 12:17.198
And that makes you
hardcore.

12:17.230 --> 12:18.868
Matt, come work for us.

12:18.900 --> 12:21.039
I don't know.
I was liking daytime TV.

12:21.070 --> 12:27.134
Well, we're gonna put a nice
big television in your office.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.876
ALICIA: These are the houses
Canning signed up.

12:29.910 --> 12:31.775
And the blue ones are ours.

12:31.810 --> 12:33.846
So we are up
seven households.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.212
Are they open to hearing
about Canning's background?

12:36.250 --> 12:39.048
Well, I have an ambassador
in the neighborhood-- Rosanna.

12:39.090 --> 12:42.082
She says that people
like Canning personally.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.554
But they are open to hearing
about collusion.

12:44.590 --> 12:46.057
A class action takes
a lot of money.

12:46.090 --> 12:47.057
My guess is he's not

12:47.100 --> 12:48.192
bankrolling
this himself.

12:48.230 --> 12:50.369
KALINDA:
I'll look for ties to JNL.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.265
DIANE: Good. And you'll
get back in the field.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.299
Quarterly partner meeting.

12:57.340 --> 12:58.409
Is something up?

12:58.440 --> 13:00.032
Something's always up.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.308
(people conversing)

13:01.340 --> 13:02.807
Thank you all.

13:02.850 --> 13:05.102
Good to have everyone here
and healthy.

13:05.150 --> 13:07.209
And let's all applaud Philip.

13:07.250 --> 13:10.287
I heard twins.

13:10.320 --> 13:14.450
Good thing. That bought you
a delay in the Diocese depo.

13:14.490 --> 13:15.514
(chuckles)

13:15.560 --> 13:18.120
Now for the current state
of our big-ticket items.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.457
How is everything

13:19.490 --> 13:21.321
with the Fallstrom
pestrcrde dump?

13:21.360 --> 13:23.464
We're in process.

13:23.500 --> 13:24.990
Lining up our class.

13:25.030 --> 13:28.238
Good. I heard there was
a bump in certification.

13:28.270 --> 13:30.465
DIANE:
Judge Abernathy.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.330
He's being-- as is his wont--
cautious.

13:32.370 --> 13:34.838
But we should know
more by Tuesday.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.848
Anything on your end, Derrick?

13:36.880 --> 13:39.348
(clears throat)

13:39.380 --> 13:42.178
I guess now's as good a time
as any.

13:42.220 --> 13:43.346
I just got the go-ahead

13:43.390 --> 13:47.986
to announce our newest client,

13:48.020 --> 13:49.988
Americans For Growth.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.554
A new bipartisan
Super-Pac

13:51.590 --> 13:53.148
with guaranteed
financing

13:53.200 --> 13:55.020
of $120 million.

13:55.060 --> 13:56.493
(partners murmur)

13:56.530 --> 13:57.895
Wow.

14:12.610 --> 14:16.944
Canning just leased a four-story
brownstone on the Gold Coast.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.412
20 grand a month.

14:18.450 --> 14:19.644
Leased?

14:19.690 --> 14:21.453
So he's only here temporarily?

14:21.490 --> 14:23.026
I'm checking.

14:23.060 --> 14:25.358
I'm also going to see
if he cosigned his lease.

14:25.390 --> 14:27.199
Okay. Good job.

14:28.630 --> 14:30.120
Sorry about that.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.661
(doorbell rings)

14:32.700 --> 14:34.338
Hi. Are you the reporter
that called?

14:34.370 --> 14:36.338
Yeah. Is he in?

14:36.370 --> 14:37.962
Uh, no, but he's
gonna be right back.

14:38.010 --> 14:39.432
Come in, though.
Come in.
Thanks.

14:39.470 --> 14:41.574
He's been preparing
all morning.

14:41.610 --> 14:42.599
And you're his...?

14:42.640 --> 14:43.607
Wife. Simone.

14:43.650 --> 14:44.969
And you are...?

14:45.010 --> 14:46.272
Kalinda.
HI.

14:46.310 --> 14:48.175
Um, he said
to make yourself at home

14:48.220 --> 14:49.448
and to answer
any questions you had.

14:49.480 --> 14:51.983
You can leave your coat
right here.

14:52.020 --> 14:54.318
And I have some hummus
and pita downstairs

14:54.360 --> 14:55.315
I'm going to get.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.453
Thank you.
Yeah.

14:57.490 --> 14:59.958
So tell me, how long have you
two been married?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.524
I don't think I'm
gonna answer that one

15:01.560 --> 15:03.061
because I'll be showing my age.

15:03.100 --> 15:04.522
Let's just say we were
high school sweethearts.

15:07.300 --> 15:08.597
Both really.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.063
Okay, fire away.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.600
"Is his condition hard on us?"

15:12.640 --> 15:14.505
"Do I have to carry him
down the stairs?"

15:14.540 --> 15:16.428
I'm sorry, I don't mean to...
You're not
prying at all.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.970
It's totally fine.
We're used to it.

15:18.010 --> 15:19.500
(children laughing)
No, no, no, guys.

15:19.550 --> 15:21.040
Can you just stay out
of Daddy's office?

15:21.080 --> 15:23.139
Thank you.
That's Jay and Bella.

15:23.190 --> 15:26.387
They're not used to
these Chicago winters.

15:26.420 --> 15:27.717
Oh, can I get
you a drink?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.250
Actually, could I use
your bathroom, please?

15:29.290 --> 15:30.427
Sure, it's right there.

15:30.460 --> 15:31.586
I'll be right back.

15:31.630 --> 15:33.188
Sure.
Okay.

15:38.330 --> 15:39.922
(computer beeps)

15:57.320 --> 16:00.949
(key in lock)

16:04.730 --> 16:05.981
Hello.

16:06.030 --> 16:08.521
Hi. I'm Kalinda.

16:08.560 --> 16:09.652
So my wife says.
Louis.

16:09.700 --> 16:11.725
Are you getting
what you need?

16:11.770 --> 16:13.635
Well, sort of,

16:13.670 --> 16:15.467
but, I mean,
anything you can help

16:15.500 --> 16:16.728
with this profile.
would be great.

16:16.770 --> 16:19.159
Oh, it's okay.

16:19.210 --> 16:20.336
I know there's no article.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.735
I've _been
expecting you.

16:22.780 --> 16:24.077
Or someone like you.

16:24.110 --> 16:25.304
Someone from
Lockhart/Gardner.

16:25.350 --> 16:27.739
So, are you finding
what you're looking for?

16:27.780 --> 16:30.010
I-I don't know.

16:30.050 --> 16:32.018
What, what should I be
looking for?

16:32.050 --> 16:33.688
Something to use against me.

16:35.290 --> 16:38.054
You have,
you have a nice brownstone.

16:38.090 --> 16:40.354
Yes, yes, I'm-I'm rich.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.549
Guilty.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.660
Gee, I think the concern is
how you got rich.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.588
Oh, you mean from screwing
the little man?

16:46.630 --> 16:48.029
More or less.

16:48.070 --> 16:49.389
Oh, no, Woody Guthrie's crying.

16:49.440 --> 16:52.068
(chuckles)

16:52.110 --> 16:53.668
You, um, you don't seem
too bothered

16:53.710 --> 16:55.371
by my being here, do you?

16:55.410 --> 16:58.402
I'm only bothered by things
I don't expect.

16:58.450 --> 17:00.418
Can I ask you
a question?

17:00.450 --> 17:02.748
Do you think people can change?

17:02.780 --> 17:05.487
Do I?

17:05.520 --> 17:07.454
No, I don't.

17:07.490 --> 17:09.481
So, once a corporate lavwer,
always a corporate lavwer?

17:09.520 --> 17:12.489
Well, I think that six months
is a very short time

17:12.530 --> 17:15.226
to go from victimizer to victim.

17:15.260 --> 17:16.454
Saint Paul did it in a second.

17:16.500 --> 17:19.128
Oh, so you're Saint Paul?

17:19.170 --> 17:21.468
No, I'm just someone who thinks

17:21.500 --> 17:23.468
Lockhart/Gardner
is just this side of incompetent

17:23.510 --> 17:25.398
and is gonna lose
a lot of money

17:25.440 --> 17:26.464
for some very nice,
deserving people.

17:26.510 --> 17:28.478
Hey, hon?
Yeah?

17:28.510 --> 17:30.774
Tell Kalinda why I quit my job.

17:30.810 --> 17:33.847
Oh, I don't think
she wants to hear
any of that, hon.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.472
Sure, she's a reporter,
of course she does.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.148
Course I do.

17:38.190 --> 17:41.455
Okay, um, well, uh,
Louis was amazing.

17:41.490 --> 17:42.809
I miscarried,

17:42.860 --> 17:45.181
and that day he quit.

17:45.230 --> 17:46.629
I'm sorry, sorry to hear that.

17:46.660 --> 17:49.527
He decided he wanted to
stay home and help me.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.369
I'll just let
you guys talk.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.492
Nice to meet you.

17:52.530 --> 17:55.260
You, too.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.164
Think that might be why I want

17:58.210 --> 18:00.735
to help a class action
of women who miscarried?

18:02.780 --> 18:05.442
ALICIA:
I don't believe you.
It's a trick.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.745
It's kind of an elaborate trick
haVIng your Wife miscarry.

18:08.780 --> 18:11.487
No. It's either not true

18:11.520 --> 18:13.317
or it's irrelevant.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.454
He's in the pocket of the
corporate interests, believe me.

18:16.490 --> 18:17.889
I think he's getting in
your head.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.592
I think you're right.
It's still a trick.

18:20.630 --> 18:22.621
Okay, I'm gonna check
into 27 Equity.

18:22.660 --> 18:24.161
I'll call you back later.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.667
Okay.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.602
Will?

18:30.640 --> 18:32.631
I hate being my mom.

18:32.670 --> 18:34.171
Oh, hi.

18:34.210 --> 18:37.771
Hi! Do you hate that,
being your mom?

18:37.810 --> 18:40.472
I'm not really my mom.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.215
I didn't think I was either.

18:42.250 --> 18:44.480
Everything I did, I ran in
the opposite direction.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.487
Have some pastrami.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.646
That's okay.

18:46.690 --> 18:47.759
My mom spent
half her life

18:47.790 --> 18:49.485
in tears, cooking dinner,

18:49.520 --> 18:51.454
waiting for my dad
to return home.

18:51.490 --> 18:52.684
And here I am.

18:52.730 --> 18:53.697
And where is he?

18:53.730 --> 18:54.492
Oh, um, I think...

18:54.530 --> 18:56.623
I warned him:
There was a meeting.

18:56.660 --> 18:57.797
fall for me and
I'm outta here.

18:57.830 --> 18:58.797
Now look at me.

18:58.830 --> 19:00.559
Go ahead, there's two.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.737
Come on.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.208
So, what's the point?

19:06.240 --> 19:07.878
I don't want this.

19:07.910 --> 19:11.573
What do you want?

19:11.610 --> 19:13.441
I...

19:16.920 --> 19:18.649
I don't know.

19:22.790 --> 19:26.624
Sometimes it's best
just to remain friends.

19:26.660 --> 19:28.799
That's what I found.

19:32.430 --> 19:33.897
PETER: So this is
a very serious Issue

19:33.940 --> 19:35.589
that doesn't get enough
attention.

19:35.640 --> 19:37.505
There is a measure
that I would support

19:37.540 --> 19:40.737
that takes medical marijuana
seriously.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.248
I've seen firsthand the damage

19:43.280 --> 19:45.498
our drug policies--
if you can call it that--

19:45.550 --> 19:48.269
has done to our court system,
our families, to lives.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.278
$100 now, $200 later.
Mm-hmm. Okay.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.582
All you have to
do is call me

19:59.630 --> 20:02.349
when you see this car
enter that garage.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.697
Okay, I'll give you
a call.

20:03.730 --> 20:04.697
Thank you.

20:06.930 --> 20:08.295
ROSANNA:
You lost two.

20:08.340 --> 20:09.659
ALICIA:
VVho?

20:09.700 --> 20:11.759
The two I was worried about,
the Hathaways and the Wicks.

20:11.810 --> 20:14.301
I was just heading
over there.

20:14.340 --> 20:16.479
How did he know
to go to them?

20:16.510 --> 20:19.479
I don't know, but he went
to them first thing.

20:19.510 --> 20:22.445
He visited Julie
this morning, too.

20:22.480 --> 20:23.788
JULIE: _
Please come In.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.318
I know Mr. Canning visited,

20:29.360 --> 20:30.987
but before you make
any decision,

20:32.730 --> 20:33.992
I want to sign with you.

20:34.030 --> 20:37.488
Oh. I'm sorry.

20:37.530 --> 20:39.020
Then that's great.

20:39.070 --> 20:40.799
JULIE:
I just don't like
how this back and forth

20:40.840 --> 20:42.796
is hurting
the neighborhood.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.865
I know. It'll be over soon.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.879
And I didn't like what he was
saying about your firm.

20:47.910 --> 20:49.707
He...?

20:49.740 --> 20:51.469
What did he say?

20:51.510 --> 20:54.513
I finally found a use
for this nanny-cam.

20:58.820 --> 21:00.708
CANNING:
I know her firm--
Lockhart/Gardner.

21:00.760 --> 21:01.988
In normal economic times,

21:02.020 --> 21:04.955
they would be exactly the type
of firm you'd be looking for.

21:04.990 --> 21:07.299
But right now they're undergoing
a partnership battle

21:07.330 --> 21:08.649
for control of the firm.

21:09.830 --> 21:12.367
And the partners
need this class action

21:12.400 --> 21:14.334
in order to fight
for that control.

21:14.370 --> 21:15.769
I didn't know if it's true,

21:15.800 --> 21:17.734
but I thought
I should bring it to you.

21:21.440 --> 21:22.839
You didn't say anything?

21:24.710 --> 21:26.507
No.

21:26.550 --> 21:28.279
Then how...?

21:29.820 --> 21:32.846
There's a mole.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.489
I mean, listen, half the
convicts I knew in prison

21:43.530 --> 21:44.758
were there because of drugs...

21:44.800 --> 21:46.722
Not too many hits.

21:46.770 --> 21:49.432
It'll grow. Peter's the first
one even talking about it.

21:49.470 --> 21:51.438
What does this do
for our older constituents?

21:51.470 --> 21:53.609
It's a dog whistle.
No one else hears it.

21:53.640 --> 21:56.029
But, uh, here,

21:56.080 --> 21:59.777
I don't know
what to do about this.

21:59.810 --> 22:01.346
(drums, synthesizer
play upbeat riff)

22:01.380 --> 22:03.814
MAN:
Who's that man walking
down the street?

22:03.850 --> 22:05.943
Peter Florrick!

22:05.990 --> 22:08.049
Who's that man
you'd like to meet?

22:08.090 --> 22:09.614
Peter Florrick!

22:09.660 --> 22:13.050
That's right, that's right.
He's here to fight!

22:13.090 --> 22:14.955
What the hell?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.524
It gets worse.

22:16.560 --> 22:17.993
Let's hear it!

22:18.030 --> 22:20.999
* Peter is the man,
Peter is the right man *

22:21.040 --> 22:24.862
* Peter has a plan,
Peter has the right plan *

22:24.910 --> 22:28.073
He's not black,
he's not white.

22:28.110 --> 22:30.032
He's got a plan
to make it right.

22:31.610 --> 22:33.612
Who is it?

22:33.650 --> 22:35.072
Neil Howard Sloan-Jacob.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.008
He's a supporter.

22:37.050 --> 22:39.041
Our supporter.

22:39.090 --> 22:40.580
You ask for civilian
Involvement,

22:40.620 --> 22:42.156
and this is what you get.

22:42.190 --> 22:44.886
* Sing it loud, we're not just
one, we're a crowd *

22:44.930 --> 22:47.854
* Not just you, not just me,
we're the Peter family! *

22:47.900 --> 22:49.720
It's been zipping around
the college blogs.

22:49.760 --> 22:50.897
It has more hits

22:50.930 --> 22:51.862
than Peter's speech.

22:51.900 --> 22:55.131
He promises to make a new video
every week.

22:55.170 --> 22:57.058
God, it's like
a hostage crisis.

22:57.100 --> 22:59.136
* Peter has the right plan

22:59.170 --> 23:00.671
Eli, you know
the worst thing

23:00.710 --> 23:01.938
to happen to any candidate?

23:01.980 --> 23:03.948
It's to be unhip.

23:03.980 --> 23:05.607
Ask Hillary in '08.

23:05.650 --> 23:08.016
I'll contact him.

23:08.050 --> 23:09.938
Hey.

23:09.980 --> 23:13.143
(off-key):
* Peter is the right man!
Whoa! *

23:13.190 --> 23:15.010
*

23:15.060 --> 23:17.085
I know who to talk to.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.121
About this? Really, I'm on it.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.754
No, no, no,
about helping us
with the youth vote.

23:20.800 --> 23:21.755
VVho?

23:21.800 --> 23:24.018
A guy I met in prison.

23:25.730 --> 23:27.129
WILL:
I don't get it.

23:27.170 --> 23:29.161
How did he know
about our partnership fight?

23:29.200 --> 23:31.031
It's not just that.
Canning's been

23:31.070 --> 23:32.958
one step ahead of us all week.

23:33.010 --> 23:34.739
Yes, but only you and I
knew this.

23:35.940 --> 23:37.703
Rosanna.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.071
Rosanna _
was here earlier

23:40.110 --> 23:42.715
when you went upstairs
for your partner meeting.

23:42.750 --> 23:44.638
WILL:
You think she overheard us
and then

23:44.690 --> 23:45.714
slipped it to Canning?

23:45.750 --> 23:47.115
I don't know.

23:47.150 --> 23:49.152
I'll see if
she flipped.

23:49.190 --> 23:51.078
Anything on who's
financing Canning?

23:51.130 --> 23:53.894
It's not JNL Pesticides.

23:53.930 --> 23:55.955
It's this-- 27 Equity,

23:56.000 --> 23:57.797
a New York hedge fund.

23:57.830 --> 23:59.991
Oh, my God, it's the newest
thing in litigation.

24:00.030 --> 24:01.895
They did the same thing
last year

24:01.940 --> 24:03.999
with the Ground Zero workers.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.065
The lawyers borrowed
$35 million

24:06.110 --> 24:08.169
to finance the lawsuit.

24:08.210 --> 24:09.677
DIANE:
The interest was
astronomical.

24:09.710 --> 24:11.246
WILL:
15% a year.

24:11.280 --> 24:14.818
So if he isn't in the pocket
of JNL, the why's he doing this?

24:14.850 --> 24:17.444
I think there's a chance
he's srncere.

24:18.850 --> 24:20.010
Doesn't matter.

24:20.050 --> 24:22.086
We still need
to beat him in court.

24:22.120 --> 24:24.224
KALINDA:
How did you communicate
with Rosanna?

24:24.260 --> 24:26.080
On the phone,
through e-mails.

24:26.130 --> 24:27.995
Let me check your computer.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.761
(phone rings)

24:30.800 --> 24:32.825
Yeah.

24:32.870 --> 24:34.963
Your car just showed up.

24:41.010 --> 24:43.171
It's not much of a cushion
being up by two people.

24:43.210 --> 24:45.269
It's all we need.

24:45.310 --> 24:47.244
BAILIFF:
All rise.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.510
ABERNATHY:
Thank you all
for returning promptly.

24:49.550 --> 24:52.110
(gavelbangs)
Court is now in session.

24:52.150 --> 24:55.187
And where are we on the class
overlap? Mr. Canning?

24:55.220 --> 24:58.257
I think some
of the Fallstrom neighbors
haven't decided yet, sir.

24:58.290 --> 25:01.191
Yes, Your Honor,
but of the neighbors who have,

25:01.230 --> 25:03.198
we have a majority:
41 to 39.

25:03.230 --> 25:05.562
No, no, actually,
I believe were tied at 40.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.137
At least when I count
my letters of consent.

25:08.170 --> 25:09.569
ABERNATHY:
Is that true, Ms. Lockhart?

25:09.600 --> 25:11.204
Mr. Gardner?

25:13.310 --> 25:17.201
I think the dust is still
settling, Your Honor.

25:17.240 --> 25:20.971
But what is true is a matter
that came to our attention:

25:21.020 --> 25:24.080
just today Mr. Canning colluded
with JNL Pesticides

25:24.120 --> 25:25.644
at their company
headquarters.

25:25.690 --> 25:28.158
Really? Colluded?

25:28.190 --> 25:29.555
Mr. Canning?

25:29.590 --> 25:30.386
It's true, Your Honor,

25:30.420 --> 25:31.250
I visited JNL
at their invitation

25:31.290 --> 25:33.554
to see what kind of deal
could be made.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.194
I must admit I was too busy
bargaining with JNL

25:36.230 --> 25:38.266
to follow opposing counsel.

25:38.300 --> 25:40.268
But I did manage to come away
with an offer of $2 million.

25:40.300 --> 25:42.188
WILL:
Your Honor, this suit is worth
20 times that amount.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.299
I-I don't know
if that's true,

25:44.340 --> 25:46.308
but I do know that $2 million
is considerably more

25:46.340 --> 25:49.229
than what's currently
on the table: zero.

25:49.280 --> 25:50.201
Mr. Canning,
it was not within your purview

25:50.240 --> 25:52.344
to negotiate on behalf
of the class action.

25:52.380 --> 25:54.177
And I didn't reach out to JNL.
They reached out to me.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.017
Because this is
a sweetheart deal.

25:56.050 --> 25:57.938
Even_if what Ms. Lockhart
IS saying IS true,

25:57.990 --> 26:00.709
isn't it better that
a TrOJan horse like myself

26:00.760 --> 26:03.251
get whatever deal
can be made now

26:03.290 --> 26:04.757
instead of waiting
the five or six years...

26:04.790 --> 26:06.121
Objection, Your Honor.
Your Honor...

26:06.160 --> 26:07.718
...for the $50 million
they're hoping for?

26:07.760 --> 26:10.320
Lockhart/Gardner's position
is to fight.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.191
And they make enemies
of their opponents.

26:12.230 --> 26:13.060
I make them my friends.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.931
Because you intend
to lower the deal!

26:14.970 --> 26:17.268
I intend to get a deal!
A fight takes time.

26:17.300 --> 26:19.336
Ask your clients if they're
willing to risk that time.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.133
Why don't we
make a deal now?
All right!

26:21.180 --> 26:23.000
I'm glad to see
you've all given blood.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.109
Let's not spill any more here.

26:24.150 --> 26:28.314
It is within my purview
to marry these two classes,

26:28.350 --> 26:30.375
and that is what I intend to do.

26:30.420 --> 26:32.012
But, Your Honor...
But, Your Honor...

26:32.050 --> 26:33.278
No, no, no.

26:33.320 --> 26:34.184
No.

26:34.220 --> 26:36.359
Mr. Canning,
Ms. Lockhart, Mr. Gardner,

26:36.390 --> 26:38.358
look across the aisle
to each other.

26:41.060 --> 26:42.288
Look.

26:44.330 --> 26:47.731
By the powers vested in me

26:47.770 --> 26:48.964
by the State of Illinois,

26:49.000 --> 26:51.639
I now pronounce you one class.

26:53.370 --> 26:54.405
Congratulations.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.203
Get a good deal.
(gavelbangs)

26:58.450 --> 27:00.145
I don't care if he says
we're married.

27:00.180 --> 27:02.114
We are in charge.

27:02.150 --> 27:05.642
Okay. Well, we'll make
the best deal we can. Okay?

27:05.690 --> 27:07.248
(sighs)

27:07.290 --> 27:09.258
You going for a quick run?

27:09.290 --> 27:11.258
Maybe not so quick.

27:11.290 --> 27:12.325
Look. I'm sorry
about dinner.

27:12.360 --> 27:14.157
We've just got
this thing and...

27:14.200 --> 27:16.191
(phone ringing)

27:16.230 --> 27:19.063
Hold on.

27:19.100 --> 27:20.260
WILL:
Hey, Kalinda. What's up?

27:20.300 --> 27:21.392
It's not a leak.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.328
What-What do you mean?
What is it?

27:23.370 --> 27:25.099
Why Canning is ahead of us.

27:25.140 --> 27:27.836
He put Spector Pro
on Alicia's laptop.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.677
That's keylogger software.

27:29.710 --> 27:30.802
What?

27:30.850 --> 27:31.669
Every key Alicia hit

27:31.710 --> 27:34.213
was sent through
a Wi-Fi parasite program

27:34.250 --> 27:35.808
to another computer.

27:35.850 --> 27:37.340
That's how Canning knew.

27:37.380 --> 27:38.312
Can we prove it?

27:38.350 --> 27:40.079
Well, we can trace it back,

27:40.120 --> 27:42.111
but he'll know we're tracing.

27:45.730 --> 27:47.186
You want to use it?

27:47.230 --> 27:49.824
Alicia, send an e-mail to Diane

27:49.860 --> 27:52.260
saying our geographical report

27:52.300 --> 27:54.291
places the target amount
at $70 million.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.295
Okay.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.365
You want to chase up the offer?

27:57.400 --> 27:58.401
Then have Diane

27:58.440 --> 27:59.759
write back saying we're willing

27:59.810 --> 28:01.368
to take it to 85 million.

28:01.410 --> 28:03.207
If Canning's in bed

28:03.240 --> 28:04.741
with JNL, they'll be terrified.

28:04.780 --> 28:06.338
Okay. Will do.

28:06.380 --> 28:08.314
Okay, call me when you're done.

28:08.350 --> 28:11.387
Okay. I'll go
for a jog with you.

28:11.420 --> 28:12.341
I have a date tomorrow night.

28:12.390 --> 28:14.779
You... You what?

28:14.820 --> 28:17.254
I have_ a date with a South
African soccer player

28:17.290 --> 28:18.951
tomorrow night.
You do not.

28:18.990 --> 28:21.322
I do. Picking me up at 8:00.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.464
Think he's gonna come
in one of those

28:25.500 --> 28:26.967
cute little soccer uniforms?

28:27.000 --> 28:30.367
I don't care how he comes.

28:32.510 --> 28:34.330
I don't understand.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.234
Are you breaking up with me?

28:36.280 --> 28:37.770
No. Just putting
things on pause.

28:37.810 --> 28:39.346
I'm not falling
in love with you.

28:39.380 --> 28:40.847
I know.

28:40.880 --> 28:42.871
I just need a little
cooling-off period. 30 days.

28:42.920 --> 28:45.286
That's all.
No. You told me
not to fall in love with you,

28:45.320 --> 28:46.947
and I didn't.
I know.

28:46.990 --> 28:48.719
30 days. I'll call you
at the end of February.

28:50.490 --> 28:52.822
(door opens)

28:52.860 --> 28:54.953
(door closes)
ALICIA:
You okay?

28:57.460 --> 28:59.223
Am I...?

28:59.270 --> 29:00.862
Yeah. Why?

29:00.900 --> 29:03.539
Well, I just asked you
what you thought

29:03.570 --> 29:05.435
a good compromise
come-out offer was,

29:05.470 --> 29:07.358
and you said, "Yes."

29:07.410 --> 29:09.537
Oh, I'm sorry.

29:09.580 --> 29:11.901
I'm distracted.

29:11.950 --> 29:13.941
I...

29:16.550 --> 29:20.316
Life is complicated, isn't it?

29:20.350 --> 29:23.786
It can be.

29:25.490 --> 29:27.048
I don't know what I want.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.966
I'm very good
when I know what I want,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.434
but when I don't,

29:34.470 --> 29:36.495
I suck.

29:38.870 --> 29:40.462
Is this work?

29:40.510 --> 29:42.501
It's...

29:48.520 --> 29:50.476
Nothing.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.488
I need friends.

29:52.520 --> 29:54.511
I need, like, a fat buddy

29:54.560 --> 29:56.084
who I can tell things to
and get drunk.

29:58.460 --> 30:01.156
I'll work on that.

30:02.630 --> 30:04.564
_ DERRICK: _
Will? Do you have a minute?

30:04.600 --> 30:06.898
It'll just be a minute.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.468
(door closes)

30:11.510 --> 30:13.603
I think we need
to talk to Diane

30:13.640 --> 30:15.130
about backing away
from litigation.

30:15.180 --> 30:16.909
Why?

30:16.940 --> 30:18.578
I think she's letting
her leftist activism

30:18.610 --> 30:19.679
get the best of her.

30:19.710 --> 30:22.076
A year ago that might have
been true, but not now.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.849
Take _over
the pestICIde case.

30:23.890 --> 30:27.382
Why? It's not mine
to take over.

30:27.420 --> 30:30.082
She's pushing for
an $85 million deal.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.122
She'll never win.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.521
How do you know that?

30:38.570 --> 30:40.993
How do I know she won't win?

30:41.040 --> 30:43.861
How do you know she's
looking for $85 million?

30:43.910 --> 30:45.969
I know.

30:48.610 --> 30:50.475
You can't tell me how?

30:50.510 --> 30:51.579
Trust me.

30:51.610 --> 30:53.578
My information is solid.

30:55.220 --> 30:58.041
Alicia wanted her
to come in at $70 million.

30:58.090 --> 30:59.842
Diane pushed it to 85.

31:05.930 --> 31:08.558
Okay, I'll talk to Diane.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.591
Good. Thanks.

31:24.980 --> 31:26.572
(school bell rings)
Get out of here!

31:26.610 --> 31:29.613
I will not get out of here.

31:30.620 --> 31:33.509
Peter asked me
personally to ask you...

31:33.550 --> 31:35.256
personally.

31:35.290 --> 31:37.554
No!No!No!No!

31:37.590 --> 31:38.522
That does not happen!

31:38.560 --> 31:39.652
That does happen.

31:39.690 --> 31:41.590
And it's happening to you.

31:41.630 --> 31:44.019
I didn't think anyone
even saw that old video.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.128
But I knew I had
to do something.

31:45.170 --> 31:47.263
Well, it was very entertaining.

31:47.300 --> 31:48.699
Well, that was the
whole point, you know?

31:48.740 --> 31:50.139
I mean, people think that
politics can be so dry,

31:50.170 --> 31:51.603
but I think it can be fun.

31:52.610 --> 31:54.305
So what is this position?

31:54.340 --> 31:57.309
Oh, well...

31:57.340 --> 32:01.015
it's the liaison
to the political director--

32:01.050 --> 32:02.142
me.

32:02.180 --> 32:03.716
And I can send you anything?

32:03.750 --> 32:05.684
Song ideas?

32:05.720 --> 32:07.540
Commercials?

32:09.720 --> 32:11.620
Yes.

32:11.660 --> 32:14.356
We've been trying to get
the public involved,

32:14.400 --> 32:16.288
get them to coordinate
with our message.

32:16.330 --> 32:18.719
So yes, send everything to me.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.567
And you don't think it's better
if I just do it on my own?

32:20.600 --> 32:23.967
_ _ No. It's-it's better _
if it comes through my office.

32:24.010 --> 32:25.568
And I'm sorry
we can't offer you

32:25.610 --> 32:27.009
a stipend at this time,

32:27.040 --> 32:28.177
but if things
work out...
Oh, no.

32:28.210 --> 32:30.178
No, no, I want to
keep my day job.

32:32.010 --> 32:36.071
This is just so
great, Mr. Gold.

32:36.120 --> 32:39.283
Please tell Peter that
I think he's amazing.

32:40.620 --> 32:43.054
By the way...

32:43.090 --> 32:45.285
Why did you do this for Peter?

32:45.330 --> 32:47.389
Why?

32:47.430 --> 32:49.648
He spoke at the school
about bullying.

32:49.700 --> 32:52.191
About making fun of kids.

32:52.230 --> 32:55.996
He said people see someone
who's different than them,

32:56.040 --> 32:58.258
and they never get a chance
to really know them.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.733
And the only way to
make life rich is,

33:00.770 --> 33:03.477
next time, have
lunch with them.

33:03.510 --> 33:06.479
Well, he said it
better than me, but

33:06.510 --> 33:08.649
the week after that,
I could just feel

33:08.680 --> 33:11.581
that the mood here...
was different.

33:11.620 --> 33:14.748
I never thought
words made much difference.

33:14.790 --> 33:17.315
Just music.

33:17.360 --> 33:20.022
But he changed people.

33:20.060 --> 33:22.790
Not for that long,
just a few days.

33:22.830 --> 33:25.663
And music
can't do that.

33:25.700 --> 33:28.692
So that's what makes this
so great

33:28.740 --> 33:31.629
is that I will be working
for him.

33:33.810 --> 33:35.675
It will be great.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.708
Nice meeting you,
Mr. Sloan-Jacob.

33:39.750 --> 33:41.308
Yes, Mr. Gold.

33:41.350 --> 33:43.045
(school bell ringing)

33:43.080 --> 33:44.445
(loud crowd chatter)

33:44.490 --> 33:45.718
(sighs)

33:45.750 --> 33:48.059
I only covered
the 27th floor desktops.

33:48.090 --> 33:49.648
28th floor was off-limits.

33:49.690 --> 33:51.829
I found keylogging
sobeare

33:51.860 --> 33:54.351
on Alicia's desktop,

33:54.400 --> 33:57.494
Julius Cain's,
and Neka's in Litigation.

33:57.530 --> 34:00.226
Now, given that wide
of a distribution,

34:00.270 --> 34:03.137
it's more likely
to be Bond spying than Canning.

34:03.170 --> 34:05.604
_ DAVID:
Two eqUIty partners and one

34:05.640 --> 34:07.767
junior associate.
Why Alicia?

34:08.840 --> 34:10.432
WILL:
Her close connection

34:10.480 --> 34:12.107
to me?
That would be my guess.

34:12.150 --> 34:14.277
He wouldn't want to put

34:14.320 --> 34:15.776
keylogging software on your
computer, but he wanted

34:15.820 --> 34:17.469
to keep track
of what you wrote

34:17.520 --> 34:19.647
to Alicia.
What did you tell her?

34:19.690 --> 34:21.658
Alicia?

34:21.690 --> 34:23.510
About this? Nothing.

34:23.560 --> 34:24.686
Thank you, Kalinda.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.254
I think we need a moment.

34:26.290 --> 34:28.053
No. I think Kalinda should stay.

34:29.200 --> 34:30.599
She can help us.

34:34.340 --> 34:37.491
WILL:
I think we should
do the same thing

34:37.540 --> 34:39.132
we were planning
to do with Canning.

34:41.380 --> 34:42.574
Use it?

34:42.610 --> 34:43.872
WILL:
Yes.

34:43.910 --> 34:45.878
Diane, you write to Julius

34:45.910 --> 34:47.446
about getting
to Bond's weakest votes.

34:47.480 --> 34:49.368
Get him to fire his own people?

34:49.420 --> 34:50.739
Yes. We need the majority

34:50.780 --> 34:52.611
of equity partners
to vote Bond out.

34:52.650 --> 34:54.288
We can't pick
off his votes.

34:54.320 --> 34:55.685
But he can.

34:56.890 --> 34:58.448
I think I'm liking this.

34:58.490 --> 35:00.526
(muffled laughter)

35:00.560 --> 35:02.721
It's gonna be hard
to go back to the law.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.819
(laughter)

35:04.870 --> 35:07.122
PET_ER:
So you just got
out of prison?

35:07.170 --> 35:09.138
Yeah. November.

35:09.170 --> 35:10.797
Eight months.

35:10.840 --> 35:13.308
Heard that you got
caught up for a while?

35:13.340 --> 35:15.501
Home monitoring.
It's not so bad.

35:15.540 --> 35:16.802
Yeah, I've been there.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.148
How's your mom?

35:18.180 --> 35:20.307
Oh, she's hanging
in there. Yours?

35:20.350 --> 35:21.817
She hates my last album.

35:21.850 --> 35:23.442
(laughs)

35:23.480 --> 35:25.914
So, uh, do you miss
anything about it?

35:25.950 --> 35:28.851
What? Being inside?

35:28.890 --> 35:30.414
(both laugh)

35:30.460 --> 35:31.757
God, no.

35:31.790 --> 35:33.382
You are funny.

35:33.430 --> 35:34.727
Foolish question.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.751
So, um, I guess
I owe you one, huh?

35:36.800 --> 35:39.462
No. No, hey,
the legal advice was free.

35:39.500 --> 35:40.899
But it was damn good advice.

35:40.930 --> 35:42.591
Better than anything I've gotten
on the outside since.

35:42.640 --> 35:43.789
I'm glad.

35:43.840 --> 35:45.262
So, what do you need?

35:45.310 --> 35:46.766
I need the youth vote.

35:46.810 --> 35:48.368
(laughs)

35:48.410 --> 35:50.469
I'm sorry.

35:50.510 --> 35:52.273
Hey, I told you,
brother-- that tatt--

35:52.310 --> 35:54.870
nice black panther right there--
you'll get my vote.

35:54.920 --> 35:58.344
Well, I was thinking
maybe just an interview.

35:58.390 --> 35:59.709
You and _me.
An InterVIew?

35:59.750 --> 36:01.559
Yeah.
Oh, that all?

36:01.590 --> 36:03.956
I mean, I thought we were
talking about a fund-raiser.

36:03.990 --> 36:05.855
Uh, sorry.

36:05.890 --> 36:07.380
I was just passing by.

36:07.430 --> 36:09.694
Um, what-what kind
of fund-raiser?

36:09.730 --> 36:11.721
MAN:
Just so we're clear.

36:11.770 --> 36:14.364
We didn't consider the offer
made to your co-counsel,

36:14.400 --> 36:16.664
Mr. Canning, to be
a lowball offer.

36:16.700 --> 36:19.339
We consider it to be our offer.

36:19.370 --> 36:21.338
Our best, last
and final.
Well, how nice
for you.

36:21.380 --> 36:22.631
Then we'll see you in court.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.341
Good.
Okay, wait.

36:24.380 --> 36:25.938
Wait. Look,
we're not trying to pick

36:25.980 --> 36:26.844
your pockets. We just need

36:26.880 --> 36:28.541
to show the judge
a hint of movement.

36:28.580 --> 36:29.842
No, we don't.

36:29.880 --> 36:31.882
Yes, actually, yes, we do.

36:31.920 --> 36:34.457
Mr. Canning, can we
talk to you a minute?

36:37.320 --> 36:38.958
Good job. Nicely played.

36:38.990 --> 36:40.548
Oh, don't
even pretend.

36:40.590 --> 36:42.990
What? We're good cop,
bad copping them.

36:43.030 --> 36:44.429
No, we're not.

36:44.470 --> 36:45.596
You're undercutting us.

36:45.630 --> 36:47.359
We'll contest
any lowball offer.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.595
It's a luclq world
where $2 million

36:49.640 --> 36:50.959
is a lowball offer.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.707
Don't worry.
We're doing great.

36:53.740 --> 36:55.503
Don't you just look at them
and feel something?

36:55.540 --> 36:57.735
Excuse me?

36:57.780 --> 36:58.974
Those mothers.

36:59.010 --> 37:00.272
They miscarried.

37:00.310 --> 37:01.743
They can't have children.

37:01.780 --> 37:04.419
Don't you feel something
when you hear them,

37:04.450 --> 37:05.849
or is your cynicism that deep?

37:05.890 --> 37:07.846
Mrs. Florrick,

37:07.890 --> 37:10.017
you don't know me.

37:10.060 --> 37:12.881
You don't know what my life is.

37:12.930 --> 37:15.649
I may have
the greatest compassion

37:15.700 --> 37:18.362
for them in the world,
or I may have none.

37:18.400 --> 37:19.594
It's irrelevant.

37:19.630 --> 37:20.927
What I owe them

37:20.970 --> 37:22.289
is not my compassion.

37:22.340 --> 37:23.637
It's my ability.

37:23.670 --> 37:25.661
And that's what I'm giving them.

37:41.090 --> 37:43.354
Canning got Rosanna
to flip to his side

37:43.390 --> 37:45.324
by showing her a document

37:45.360 --> 37:46.452
from JNL Pesticides.

37:46.490 --> 37:47.627
What kind of a document?

37:47.660 --> 37:49.958
An internal analysis of what
they were willing to pay.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.695
Does she have a copy?

37:51.730 --> 37:52.867
No. He just showed it to her.

37:52.900 --> 37:54.390
Then it doesn't matter.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.896
_ He'll c_laim
It's prIVIleged,

37:55.940 --> 37:57.066
part of negotiations.

37:57.100 --> 38:00.001
No. He can't.

38:00.040 --> 38:02.304
Sure, he...

38:06.650 --> 38:09.539
We got to get
to Judge Abernathy.

38:16.360 --> 38:17.816
(loud, overlapping chatter)

38:20.360 --> 38:21.998
Okay, okay.
(chatter stops)

38:22.030 --> 38:26.797
Please don't put me in the
position of refereeing everyone.

38:26.830 --> 38:28.024
We had our settlement offer

38:28.070 --> 38:29.537
accepted.

38:29.570 --> 38:31.333
$2.4 million,

38:31.370 --> 38:33.509
with one million in reserve
for future claims.

38:33.540 --> 38:35.735
That offer was_ made
to Mr. Canning,

38:35.780 --> 38:36.929
and not...

38:36.980 --> 38:39.642
Okay. You don't have a deal,
Mr. Foxson, until the court

38:39.680 --> 38:40.942
certifies a deal.

38:40.980 --> 38:43.039
Now, who is this witness?

38:43.080 --> 38:45.810
DIANE:
Mr. Carl Hobart, Your Honor.

38:45.850 --> 38:47.442
And what will
he testify to?

38:47.490 --> 38:48.957
An exhibit_ we would like
to place Into eVIdence.

38:48.990 --> 38:51.117
Okay. So, proceed.

38:51.160 --> 38:53.025
Mr. Hobart, what is your job?

38:53.060 --> 38:55.995
My job? I am a claims analyst
with 27 Equity.

38:56.030 --> 38:58.089
DIANE:
And that is a hedge fund?

38:58.130 --> 38:59.995
CARL:
Yes.
And you were recently sent

39:00.030 --> 39:01.736
a document
by Mr. Louis Canning?

39:01.770 --> 39:02.737
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

39:02.770 --> 39:05.034
Uh, uh, uh, uh, Mr. Canning,

39:05.070 --> 39:08.369
you can't object
to your own co-counsel.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.900
Objection, Your Honor.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.076
Relevance.

39:13.110 --> 39:14.611
I think

39:14.650 --> 39:17.118
I'll overrule that
on absurdity alone.

39:17.150 --> 39:18.788
You may answer.

39:18.820 --> 39:21.709
CARL:
Yes, I was sent a
document for review.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.648
DIANE:
As collateral
for Mr. Canning's loan?

39:23.690 --> 39:25.453
CARL:
Yes.

39:25.490 --> 39:27.082
Uh, we loaned
Mr. Canning $4 million

39:27.130 --> 39:28.791
for this lawsuit,
so we needed

39:28.830 --> 39:29.956
to see all relevant documents.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.558
DIANE:
And this document
under discussion

39:31.600 --> 39:32.760
was prepared by JNL Pesticides

39:32.800 --> 39:33.994
stating how much
they were willing...

39:34.030 --> 39:35.167
Objection!

39:35.200 --> 39:36.337
Objection!

39:36.370 --> 39:38.964
CANNING:
Your Honor, this document
was part of evidence,

39:39.010 --> 39:40.898
and is, therefore,
privileged.

39:40.940 --> 39:42.976
It, therefore,
cannot be used in court.

39:43.010 --> 39:44.079
That would be
true, Your Honor,

39:44.110 --> 39:46.146
except that Mr. Canning
pierced his own privilege

39:46.180 --> 39:47.408
by showing this document

39:47.450 --> 39:48.576
to a hedge fund.

39:48.620 --> 39:49.871
Now, he can't have it
both ways.

39:49.920 --> 39:50.978
Either it's privileged,
or it's not.

39:51.020 --> 39:52.009
And now... it's not.

39:52.050 --> 39:53.483
Your Honor?

39:55.520 --> 39:59.081
That seems a particularly
good point,

39:59.130 --> 40:00.984
Mr. Canning.
You can't pick

40:01.030 --> 40:02.952
and choose when
Privilege applies.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.093
Do you have anything else?

40:09.170 --> 40:11.934
No, Your Honor.

40:11.970 --> 40:14.939
Okay, I'll admit it.
Nicely played.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.936
Thank you.

40:16.980 --> 40:18.777
You still have
to make a deal.

40:18.810 --> 40:20.801
My guess is it'll be easier now.

40:23.750 --> 40:26.514
So, that was all cynical, right?

40:26.550 --> 40:28.518
You were just trying to lower

40:28.560 --> 40:31.051
the amount
of the award?

40:31.090 --> 40:33.650
I think people were harmed here,

40:33.690 --> 40:37.194
and I think companies ought
to pay for their mistakes.

40:37.230 --> 40:40.996
But I think companies are paying
too much for their mistakes,

40:41.030 --> 40:43.191
and I think lawyers
are helping people

40:43.240 --> 40:44.901
distort the amount of harm.

40:44.940 --> 40:47.829
That's all.

40:47.870 --> 40:50.100
So, if that's cynical, then...

40:50.140 --> 40:53.007
I'm a cynic.

40:54.250 --> 40:58.141
* The bells ring no, no, no,
no, no, no, no *

40:58.180 --> 41:00.512
* No, no, no,
no, no, no, no *

41:00.550 --> 41:03.189
* No, no, no, no, no, no, no

41:06.190 --> 41:08.226
* The bells ring
no, no, no... *

41:08.260 --> 41:10.125
It worked.

41:10.160 --> 41:13.061
That's one of his votes.

41:13.100 --> 41:15.159
Looks like he's sending
him back to DC.

41:15.200 --> 41:17.191
Hmm. I love it.

41:22.210 --> 41:24.178
* The bells ring
no, no, no, no *

41:24.210 --> 41:27.771
* No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no *

41:27.810 --> 41:30.142
* No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no *

41:30.180 --> 41:33.183
How was your South African
soccer player?

41:33.220 --> 41:35.950
Fictional.

41:38.930 --> 41:40.886
I don't know
what this is. I...

41:40.930 --> 41:44.058
I don't like needing...

41:44.100 --> 41:46.022
anyone.

41:46.070 --> 41:47.628
I know.

41:49.640 --> 41:51.164
It's not commitment.

41:51.200 --> 41:54.806
It's just
preferential treatment.

41:54.840 --> 41:56.171
I can deal with that.

41:56.210 --> 41:58.201
Mmm.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.204
(sniffing)

42:01.250 --> 42:03.275
Mmm.

42:03.320 --> 42:05.914
Mmm! You smell like you.

42:05.950 --> 42:07.247
You smell like Will.

42:07.290 --> 42:09.713
(chuckling)

42:09.760 --> 42:12.729
I thought I could
do without it.

42:12.760 --> 42:16.150
But you have to be
more gentle with me.

42:16.200 --> 42:21.126
I'm not as tough as I look.

42:21.170 --> 42:23.035
Okay.

42:23.070 --> 42:24.560
* The bells ring

42:24.610 --> 42:27.829
* No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no *

42:27.870 --> 42:32.273
* No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no... *

42:34.310 --> 42:37.108
PETER:
We're climbing
with the 18-

42:37.150 --> 42:39.118
to 25-year-olds.

42:39.150 --> 42:41.584
Congratulations.

42:41.620 --> 42:43.315
Suddenly I'm hip.

42:43.360 --> 42:45.328
I never thought you weren't.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.021
The rapper
Young Boxer--

42:47.060 --> 42:49.153
he's going to do a
benefit concert for me.

42:52.030 --> 42:54.089
So, how was your day?

42:54.130 --> 42:56.667
(laughs)
