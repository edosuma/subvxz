WEBVTT

00:34.368 --> 00:36.104
Oh my gosh!

00:36.137 --> 00:37.705
I got a tea set!

00:50.718 --> 00:51.719
Ahh!

00:51.752 --> 00:53.154
( bleep )

00:58.326 --> 00:59.693
Oh!

00:59.727 --> 01:02.596
Look, it's a blue monkey
Santa brought me!

01:02.630 --> 01:05.333
Aww, just
like I asked him for!

01:06.567 --> 01:08.102
Sir, I need a blue monkey.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.237
I need a blue monkey.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.474
Oh Daddy, look!

01:13.507 --> 01:14.775
She's beautiful.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.615
What the hell?

01:21.649 --> 01:24.152
What the hell?

01:24.185 --> 01:26.287
What happened to
your eyes?

01:26.320 --> 01:28.189
( rattling )

01:34.295 --> 01:35.563
Jesus.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.564
Come on, come on.

01:36.597 --> 01:37.565
I got it, I got it.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.699
I got it.

01:43.471 --> 01:44.772
Okay...

01:48.209 --> 01:49.710
Dammit.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.416
Okay.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.251
There's got to be another
way through this.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.321
Oh, shit.

02:36.524 --> 02:39.327
Shit on
my father's balls.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.428
Shit!

02:47.401 --> 02:48.369
Aww...

02:48.402 --> 02:51.305
Aw, sweet Jesus.

02:51.339 --> 02:52.506
Can you see?

02:52.540 --> 02:54.442
You pretty, pretty,
pretty...

02:57.678 --> 02:59.513
Ha ha ha...

03:02.316 --> 03:03.451
Oh!

03:10.391 --> 03:11.859
Oh, come on.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.199
Okay.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.686
Oh shit!

03:38.719 --> 03:40.888
Shit.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.744
( sobbing )

04:54.795 --> 04:56.930
Look at the book Santa
brought me.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.766
That's actually from me.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.468
Will you read it
to me?

05:00.501 --> 05:01.835
Sure, come over here.

05:05.473 --> 05:06.707
"The Story About Ping."

05:06.740 --> 05:07.875
That's Ping.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.477
What a cute duck.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.612
"Once upon a time, there
was a beautiful young duck

05:11.645 --> 05:13.514
"named Ping.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.483
"Ping lived with his mother
and his father

05:15.516 --> 05:16.784
"and his two sisters
and three brothers

05:16.817 --> 05:20.454
"and 11 aunts
and seven uncles and 42 cousins.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.523
"Their home was a boat with
two wise eyes

05:22.556 --> 05:23.824
on the Yangtze River."

05:23.857 --> 05:25.693
That's in China.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.628
"Each morning as the sun
rose from the east,

05:27.661 --> 05:29.497
"Ping and his
mother and his father

05:29.530 --> 05:31.699
"and his sisters and brothers
and aunts and uncles

05:31.732 --> 05:33.534
"and his 42 cousins

05:33.567 --> 05:35.803
"all marched one by one
down the little bridge

05:35.836 --> 05:38.706
"to the shore of
the Yangtze River."

05:38.739 --> 05:42.510
It looks like it's so nice
to live on that river.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.911
Yeah, it does,
doesn't it?

05:45.946 --> 05:47.548
( knocking )

05:51.852 --> 05:52.853
Mom!
Mommy!

05:52.886 --> 05:55.889
Hi.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.558
Hey.
Hey.

05:57.591 --> 05:58.826
Hi.
Hi.

05:58.859 --> 05:59.993
Merry Christmas.

06:00.027 --> 06:00.994
How are you, Patrick?
Heya, man.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.763
Hi.

06:02.796 --> 06:03.997
Come see what Santa
brought!

06:04.031 --> 06:05.566
Okay.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.403
Can I get something to
drink or something?

06:09.437 --> 06:10.671
Oh, no,
I'm good... thanks.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.540
Okay.

06:12.573 --> 06:13.641
I'm sorry I can't stay
longer, I just--

06:13.674 --> 06:15.476
I don't want to be late
for an international flight.

06:15.509 --> 06:16.510
Yeah, that's okay.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.846
When are
you all returning?

06:18.879 --> 06:20.514
January 14th.

06:20.548 --> 06:21.882
I have
all their schoolwork

06:21.915 --> 06:22.916
and I'm in touch with
their teachers.

06:22.950 --> 06:23.951
Okay.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.853
Can you have them
call me,

06:25.886 --> 06:27.521
maybe send
me pictures if you take any?

06:27.555 --> 06:28.956
Of course.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.558
Thank you.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.596
So is it like a no-go with
the Letterman thing?

06:35.629 --> 06:36.864
Oh, yeah, no.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.633
Yeah, that's not--

06:39.667 --> 06:41.869
Not-- Did not--

06:41.902 --> 06:43.504
Did not get that.

06:43.537 --> 06:46.507
That's--

06:46.540 --> 06:47.708
Anyway.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.510
Merry Christmas.

06:49.543 --> 06:50.478
Thanks.

06:50.511 --> 06:51.779
You too.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.616
How's it going?

06:55.649 --> 06:57.417
It's going.

06:58.852 --> 06:59.987
Okay.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.918
( phone ringing )

08:06.920 --> 08:08.121
Hello?

08:08.155 --> 08:10.524
Hey, big brother.
Merry Christmas.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.626
Hey... Hi.

08:12.660 --> 08:13.827
Were you sleeping?

08:13.861 --> 08:16.697
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.799
Bubba, it's 3:00
in the afternoon.
You okay?

08:18.832 --> 08:20.133
I'm fine.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.135
Are you all by yourself?

08:22.169 --> 08:24.605
Well, do you have
to say "all"?

08:24.638 --> 08:26.674
I mean,
can I just be by myself?

08:26.707 --> 08:28.041
The kids are with Janet?

08:28.075 --> 08:30.644
Yeah, for two weeks.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.079
What are you doing for
New Year's?

08:32.112 --> 08:34.648
This.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.917
Ugh, Louie, come on, don't
do that.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.819
I'm doing it.

08:38.852 --> 08:43.691
Louie, I don't want you to
be alone for New Year's.

08:43.724 --> 08:44.892
Louie.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.027
Debbie, I'm fine.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.196
Happy new year,
merry Christmas, I'm fine.

08:49.229 --> 08:52.700
Listen, we are taking the
kids to Mexico for New Year's.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.167
We're going
to visit Abuelita

08:54.201 --> 08:55.168
and we're just gonna relax.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.203
I think you should come
with us.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.606
Ah...
Debbie.

08:58.639 --> 08:59.940
Doug bought
you a ticket, okay?

08:59.973 --> 09:01.575
All you have to do--
Debbie--

09:01.609 --> 09:03.010
I don't want you to be
by yourself.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.679
Doug is being
really nice right now.

09:05.713 --> 09:06.680
Is that your brother?
Mm-hmm.

09:06.714 --> 09:07.948
Give me that.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.117
Yo.
Is this Funnyman?

09:10.150 --> 09:12.052
Hey Doug, how you doing?

09:12.085 --> 09:14.054
Funnyman, listen up.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.189
We're taking the kids down
to Mexico to see your Abuelita.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.892
We are staying
at the Casa Grande Hotel.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.929
It's got a heated pool,
hot wings on tap.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.797
Now, I got you
first-class ticket out of that

09:23.831 --> 09:25.733
left wing Kennedy Airport?

09:25.766 --> 09:28.602
And you must come, I will
not take no for an answer.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.904
Doug, listen, that's
really nice of you, but I--

09:30.938 --> 09:31.872
Good!

09:31.905 --> 09:32.906
We'll see you there.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.742
Bye.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.711
Hi.
Hi.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.212
Debbie, listen,
I really--

09:39.246 --> 09:41.214
I can't do it, I can't.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.684
Well, I really hope
you do.

09:43.717 --> 09:48.622
And if you
don't... Happy New Year.

09:48.656 --> 09:51.725
Happy New Year to
you, too.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.927
I love you, Louie.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.629
You know that.

09:55.663 --> 09:58.899
Yeah, I know... I--

09:58.932 --> 09:59.900
Okay, bye.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.034
Muah!

10:05.272 --> 10:06.907
Uhh...

10:06.940 --> 10:08.676
Coming up, the story of an
unusual Christmas gift

10:08.709 --> 10:11.111
received anonymously by a
local woman.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.646
That's right, Jeff.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.981
Anna Davis
didn't even know

10:14.014 --> 10:14.982
that her neighbors
were gay men.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.650
Jim Callosonoponocco

10:16.684 --> 10:18.819
is live on the scene with
these report.

10:39.773 --> 10:40.941
Lily.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.209
Hi, Jane!

10:42.242 --> 10:43.977
Hi!

10:44.011 --> 10:47.715
Oh my gosh, it's so
good to see you.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.783
I know, we're grown-ups.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.819
Wow, we're like--

10:51.852 --> 10:53.320
Probably in our 20s.

10:53.353 --> 10:56.123
Probably... What do you do?

10:56.156 --> 10:59.292
Um, I have, like, a
career-y thing and--

10:59.326 --> 11:00.961
Wow!

11:00.994 --> 11:02.830
I work and--

11:02.863 --> 11:04.197
I'm probably an artist.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.799
Oh, my gosh.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.667
And hopefully, it's
going well.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.706
Have you seen Daddy
lately?

11:12.740 --> 11:15.142
Well, I saw him in April.
What about you?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.044
I'm gonna see him for
his birthday.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.846
How is he?

11:18.879 --> 11:19.913
Oh, boy.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.782
Not so good.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.984
I mean, he's
so alone.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.153
I know,
it's depressing.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.990
He just sits there in his
place and doesn't do anything.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.859
He doesn't see anybody.

11:31.892 --> 11:32.993
I know.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.996
And now it's too late for
him to even find someone.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.898
All he does is sit in that
big old chair

11:37.931 --> 11:41.034
and eat pinwheel cookies.

11:41.068 --> 11:44.337
It's so sad.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.906
He is all alone.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.208
Just alone and not with
anybody.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.343
It's so sad
that he's alone.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.212
I hate that he's alone.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.781
Always alone.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.283
Why didn't he try harder
to be less alone?

11:56.316 --> 11:58.018
Yeah.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.087
How are we gonna know when
we get to be this age

12:00.120 --> 12:02.189
not to be alone?

12:02.222 --> 12:04.091
Yeah.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.358
We're probably kind of
( bleep ) up

12:05.392 --> 12:07.828
from having
that kind of a dad.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.301
( man )
Well, it's New Year's Eve,
of course that means

12:14.334 --> 12:16.904
people partying,
carrying on, sharing,

12:16.937 --> 12:18.939
but it's also a very
busy time at crisis centers.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.841
That's right, Trisha.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.109
Statistics show that New
Year's Eve is when folks

12:22.142 --> 12:24.277
are most likely to commit
suicide.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.879
More than 500 New Yorkers
are expected

12:25.913 --> 12:28.215
to take their
own lives tonight,

12:28.248 --> 12:30.150
especially those who are
spending New Year's Eve

12:30.183 --> 12:31.384
by themselves.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.886
( man )
All by themselves.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.955
Alone with no one near
your body.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.256
Go ahead and put that gun
in your mouth.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.230
Ahh!

12:43.263 --> 12:44.832
Ahhh!

13:25.005 --> 13:27.107
Do you need a seat?

13:27.140 --> 13:28.876
Here you go.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.115
Louie!

13:35.148 --> 13:36.283
Liz?

13:36.316 --> 13:38.285
Oh, my God.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.386
Oh, my God,
it's you.

13:42.022 --> 13:45.025
Hey! Hey!

13:45.058 --> 13:48.228
Hey! Hey! Hey!

13:48.261 --> 13:52.165
( ambulance radio chatter )

13:58.105 --> 14:00.507
( sirens )

14:03.510 --> 14:06.313
Uh, she had cancer when
she was a teenager.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.049
Well, whatever it is, it is
coming back aggressively.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.383
Has she
been in treatment?

14:10.417 --> 14:11.418
Has she been having
any symptoms?

14:11.451 --> 14:12.485
I don't know, I--

14:12.519 --> 14:13.520
Are you in touch
with her family?

14:13.553 --> 14:14.988
Because we're running tests,

14:15.022 --> 14:16.056
but I gotta figure out
what this is.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.324
Pressure's dropping!

14:17.357 --> 14:19.092
Give her an amp with
that thing.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.894
( machine beeping )

14:20.928 --> 14:23.096
Go ahead.
Jesus, am I dying?

14:23.130 --> 14:24.431
Am I dying?

14:24.464 --> 14:26.967
Uh... I don't know.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.202
I'm not ready
for this.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.337
This is crazy.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.404
You're gonna be okay.

14:31.438 --> 14:32.940
You're gonna be
all right.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.507
I don't think so.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.443
Oh, Louie.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.045
Yeah?
