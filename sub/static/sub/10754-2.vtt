00:16.058 --> 00:19.144
- What the hell are you doing?
- Ironing your son's socks.

00:19.311 --> 00:22.981
Why don't you twist them into balls
like you do mine?

00:23.148 --> 00:27.194
He says it bruises the cashmere.
He likes them pressed, folded,

00:27.361 --> 00:29.780
then neatly arranged in sock dividers.

00:29.947 --> 00:32.073
I saw them in a catalogue once,

00:32.241 --> 00:36.245
but couldn't imagine
who would buy such silly things.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.705
Of course, I hadn't met Dr Crane yet.

00:39.248 --> 00:42.709
We thought there'd been
a mix-up at the hospital.

00:42.876 --> 00:47.130
When Niles came along,
it shot that theory all to hell.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.426
Oh, Dad, please. Coaster.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.637
Your beer is sweating.

00:53.804 --> 00:57.975
So am I. You want to
shove one of those under my can?

01:01.645 --> 01:02.980
(Doorbell rings)

01:03.105 --> 01:05.190
If he could, he would.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.986
Mrs Greenway,
what a pleasant surprise.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.239
- That's him.
- Won't you come in?

01:12.406 --> 01:15.742
I had to see him again,
but now I'm positive.

01:15.909 --> 01:20.873
That is the horny little mixed breed
who got my Phoebe pregnant.

01:22.541 --> 01:25.460
You can't just bust in here
accusing my dog.

01:25.627 --> 01:29.423
I had to keep shooing him away
from Phoebe in the park!

01:29.590 --> 01:34.344
Look at him. He doesn't care
whose life he's ruined!

01:34.511 --> 01:38.223
All he cares about
is his own selfish pleasure!

01:39.474 --> 01:43.478
You know your problem, Dorothea?
You got a bad attitude.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.273
That's why nobody sits with you
in the park.

01:46.440 --> 01:50.444
There's no way Eddie could be
the father. He's been neutered.

01:50.611 --> 01:54.323
Oh, really?
Then how do you explain these?

01:54.489 --> 01:56.533
Oh, my God!

02:00.037 --> 02:04.082
- They're miniature Eddies!
- Aren't they adorable?

02:04.249 --> 02:07.586
Well, I'm glad you think so,
because they're yours.

02:07.753 --> 02:12.925
Bad dog! Look what you did!
Here, take these.

02:13.091 --> 02:17.638
Dad, I expect an explanation.
I thought Eddie had been fixed.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.848
All you had to do was look.

02:20.015 --> 02:23.685
Well, I'm glad to say
I've never been that bored.

02:23.852 --> 02:27.898
- Couldn't you just eat 'em up?
- For God's sake. Don't love them.

02:28.065 --> 02:31.026
They'll think they're staying.
Keep them off the couch.

02:31.193 --> 02:34.071
Why did you let him run in the park?

02:34.238 --> 02:37.950
Haven't you seen the way
he romances my towel warmer?

02:38.116 --> 02:40.410
He's cooped up here all day.

02:40.577 --> 02:43.497
In the park,
I let him get some exercise.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.124
Apparently, that's not all he got.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.670
I've found the perfect name for this one.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.338
Stop!

02:51.505 --> 02:55.050
Dogs only need names
if you plan to call them to you.

02:55.217 --> 03:01.014
Listen, you get right back in there,
you mangy little thing! My God!

03:01.181 --> 03:05.227
I'm going to the radio station.
We'll talk when I get back.

03:05.394 --> 03:08.856
Oh, relax, Frasier. I'll have
Eddie taken care of tomorrow.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.692
You better.
Daphne, give me that box.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.902
Where are you taking them?

03:14.069 --> 03:19.324
- To unload them at the station.
- Couldn't we keep them for a while?

03:19.491 --> 03:22.661
No. We don't want them
taking after their father.

03:22.828 --> 03:25.122
It may be too late already.

03:25.289 --> 03:29.626
Oh, for God's sake.
Stop staring at me!

03:35.257 --> 03:37.301
Hello, Roz. You look lovely.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.888
- I don't want one.
- I didn't say anything.

03:41.054 --> 03:44.766
Betty from accounting warned me.
Where did you find them?

03:44.933 --> 03:50.480
In my living room.
These are Eddie's mongrel seed.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.859
Do you know anybody
that wants six puppies?

03:54.026 --> 03:56.320
Six? All right, Eddie!

03:56.486 --> 03:57.905
Please.

03:58.071 --> 04:02.075
I've been in the hallway
for an hour trying to unload them.

04:02.242 --> 04:06.622
- I haven't had any luck.
- Not everybody likes dogs.

04:06.788 --> 04:11.627
Take me. I'm a cat person.
It's not like I'd buy a cat mug,

04:11.793 --> 04:14.046
but I had a cat
when I was growing up.

04:14.213 --> 04:16.298
We were almost inseparable.

04:16.464 --> 04:19.384
Muffles or Scruffles,
something like that.

04:20.469 --> 04:24.973
You know, Roz,
it's possible there's a dog lover

04:25.140 --> 04:28.060
inside you just dying to get out.
Don't you think so?

04:28.227 --> 04:30.479
Come on. Just take a look.

04:30.646 --> 04:34.149
Come on. Take a look.
Have a look.

04:35.776 --> 04:40.864
Oh, he's adorable!
Oh, come here, little fella!

04:41.031 --> 04:44.284
Oh. Aren't you
the cutest little thing?

04:44.451 --> 04:46.119
Oh, yeah.

04:46.286 --> 04:50.874
Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss.
Oh! I love you too.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.085
There. Happy now?

04:57.339 --> 05:00.217
Roz,
how can you just toss him aside

05:00.384 --> 05:02.511
after such a tender display of affection?

05:02.678 --> 05:04.805
I can do it with men, too.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.059
Come on.
It's time to start the show.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.645
Phil, puppy! Puppy!

05:12.729 --> 05:16.233
They're all on to me.
All right, you behave yourselves.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.488
Hello, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane,

05:21.655 --> 05:24.116
coming to you
from KACL 780 Talk Radio.

05:24.283 --> 05:26.743
I'll be with you
for the next three hours.

05:26.910 --> 05:28.954
Roz, who's our first caller?

05:29.121 --> 05:32.666
Rita is on line four.
She feels overwhelmed at home.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.794
Hello, Rita. I'm listening.

05:35.961 --> 05:38.005
(Rita) 'Yeah, Dr Crane.

05:38.172 --> 05:41.091
'Oh, Dr Crane,
thank you for taking my call.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.385
'I...I tell you, I...

05:43.552 --> 05:46.305
'I'm about to lose my mind.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.974
'I am raising four kids by myself.

05:49.141 --> 05:53.854
'The oldest one is not even seven
and the others are under five.

05:54.021 --> 05:57.816
'Between cooking, cleaning, changing
diapers and tripping over toys...

05:57.941 --> 06:02.362
'I...feel sometimes
like I am about to snap.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.573
'What should I do?'

06:04.740 --> 06:07.784
Have you considered getting a puppy?

06:13.207 --> 06:15.042
(Puppies whimper)

06:15.209 --> 06:18.003
If we can't have this one,
are there any others available?

06:18.170 --> 06:20.464
No. We found homes for the others.

06:20.631 --> 06:24.259
- Thanks for coming over.
- But the children. Dr Crane...

06:24.426 --> 06:28.722
There are other dogs in the world.
Now, give me that.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.726
Thank you for coming over.
Thank you.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.980
I thought you might like
some wine and pâté.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.858
I made some lemonade for the children.

06:44.238 --> 06:48.617
Where are the Thomasons?
Why is that dog still here?

06:48.784 --> 06:51.870
I'm sorry, but they struck me
as unfit guardians.

06:52.037 --> 06:55.624
For God's sake. He works at the zoo!

06:55.791 --> 06:59.127
She's a nurse! Billy's an altar
boy and Kathy is a campfire girl!

06:59.294 --> 07:01.797
They had a dark aura.

07:01.964 --> 07:05.676
They had a ten-acre farm!
I'd have gone with them!

07:05.843 --> 07:10.556
I see. So you want me to
give him away to just anybody?

07:10.722 --> 07:12.224
(Doorbell)

07:12.391 --> 07:15.644
I'm not saying that.
It's just that he can't stay here.

07:17.354 --> 07:21.525
- Hello, Niles. Come in.
- I hope you don't mind my stopping by.

07:21.733 --> 07:25.112
Maris is hosting the Women's
League Senior Yoga Group.

07:25.279 --> 07:28.657
And, well,
old money and body stockings...

07:32.327 --> 07:35.581
Say no more.
You're welcome to hide out here.

07:35.747 --> 07:40.252
- I see the kennel is still open.
- Yes, but that's the last one.

07:40.419 --> 07:45.382
I'd found a home for him, but Daphne
thought the family wasn't nice enough.

07:45.549 --> 07:49.261
- Some pâté, Niles?
- I didn't reject them. The dog did.

07:49.428 --> 07:53.098
Canines have a very
keen sense of who's a nice person.

07:53.265 --> 07:56.602
Many's the time
I've chosen a man based solely

07:56.768 --> 07:59.146
on the way
my mum's spaniel took to him.

07:59.313 --> 08:03.400
Daphne, that is preposterous,
letting a dog choose your dates.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.445
It's true. If a dog likes a man,

08:06.612 --> 08:09.740
it's a good bet
he's warm and sensitive.

08:09.907 --> 08:13.660
I didn't get
a good look at this little tike.

08:15.579 --> 08:20.375
Come here, boy.
Come to your Uncle Niles. Oh! Oh!

08:26.006 --> 08:28.509
He's taken quite a shine to you.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.802
Yes. Happens all the time.

08:33.222 --> 08:35.890
Daphne, would you take the dog away?

08:36.058 --> 08:39.394
Phone the Thomasons
and tell them we've reconsidered.

08:39.561 --> 08:42.272
All right,
but only for a two-week trial.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.650
- Thank you.
- Come along, Basil.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.985
I told you not to name them!

08:48.070 --> 08:52.032
- Hello, Dad.
- Afternoon, boys.

08:57.663 --> 09:00.249
Dad, I seem to remember that Eddie

09:00.415 --> 09:03.585
had a little appointment
down at the vet's.

09:03.752 --> 09:08.507
I can't help but notice
he still has that...spring in his step.

09:12.594 --> 09:17.015
We started heading down there,
but the traffic was a bear.

09:17.182 --> 09:21.186
You get a sunny day
and everybody forgets how to drive.

09:23.856 --> 09:25.899
You are going to reschedule?

09:26.066 --> 09:28.527
(Martin)
Oh, yeah. I'll call in the morning.

09:28.694 --> 09:32.614
This is the second time
you've cancelled. What's the problem?

09:32.781 --> 09:35.450
'There's no problem.
What's the big deal?

09:35.617 --> 09:37.744
'I'll call tomorrow. Relax, will you?'

09:39.288 --> 09:42.040
- Dear God, he's licking me!
- Eddie!

09:42.207 --> 09:44.376
Eddie, just stop.

09:45.878 --> 09:47.504
Niles...

09:48.797 --> 09:51.175
You have liver behind your ears.

09:52.551 --> 09:55.637
I imagine I must have picked up
a cracker

09:55.804 --> 09:58.098
and inadvertently
scratched behind my ear.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.810
You had a wad of cold meat
behind your ears

10:01.977 --> 10:04.646
and you didn't feel it?

10:04.813 --> 10:07.441
That's the story
I'm sticking with, yes.

10:10.986 --> 10:14.072
I want an assurance
you'll take care of it.

10:14.239 --> 10:18.744
- You promise?
- I said I'd do it and I will!

10:18.911 --> 10:22.289
Get off my back!
I'll be down at Duke's.

10:23.415 --> 10:26.919
Ever notice how much faster
he moves when he's wrong?

10:27.085 --> 10:30.339
He's got a psychological block
against taking Eddie there.

10:30.506 --> 10:34.676
I'll have to do it. Somebody has
to be responsible. Good boy.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.970
Come on. Let's go. Eddie?

10:39.097 --> 10:40.516
Uh, Niles.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.811
Oh. Now, Eddie,
it's a routine operation.

10:44.978 --> 10:49.399
They say it's almost painless,
although I can't imagine...

10:52.611 --> 10:56.615
No, Niles. Perhaps it's best
we don't discuss the operation.

10:56.782 --> 10:58.825
We might spook him.

10:58.992 --> 11:02.329
Excuse me?
Are you saying he understands me?

11:03.413 --> 11:07.334
Well, he understands
the word B-A-T-H.

11:07.501 --> 11:10.087
God knows how much English
he's picked up.

11:10.254 --> 11:12.089
Fine.

11:12.256 --> 11:15.342
(Speaking French)

11:23.225 --> 11:25.727
What are we doing?
Eddie, come here!

11:25.894 --> 11:28.480
This is ridiculous. Look at him!

11:48.000 --> 11:50.252
What are you staring at?

11:52.212 --> 11:55.048
You know why you're here,
don't you?

11:56.133 --> 12:00.554
Listen, it's for your own good.
You'll be much happier afterwards.

12:05.392 --> 12:09.605
Look, your day-to-day routine,
it'll be exactly the same.

12:09.771 --> 12:13.233
You'll be able to sleep,
run around with your little buddies,

12:13.400 --> 12:16.695
go play in the woods,
chase the birds, lick your...

12:21.325 --> 12:23.368
Did I mention sleep?

12:24.870 --> 12:28.332
You got a lot of nerve!
You all right, boy?

12:28.499 --> 12:30.626
Why are you so upset?

12:30.792 --> 12:33.879
- I'm helping you out.
- That's a load of crap!

12:34.046 --> 12:38.091
We agreed on this.
You had a problem so I took charge.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.803
I don't need you taking charge.
Mind your own business.

12:41.970 --> 12:45.224
I don't need your help
and I don't want it!

12:45.390 --> 12:47.518
It doesn't matter who brought him here.

12:47.684 --> 12:52.064
I can do it, I feed him,
walk him and give him his bath.

12:52.231 --> 12:54.191
- Eddie!
- No!

12:54.358 --> 12:56.818
- See what you did?
- Me?

12:58.445 --> 13:02.741
OK, thanks. Listen, Daphne's
here in case anybody sees him.

13:04.326 --> 13:07.412
I got the guys at the station
circulating Eddie's picture.

13:07.579 --> 13:11.750
- I'll look for him some more.
- You've done enough.

13:11.917 --> 13:14.253
- Sit still and drink your tea.
- I hate tea.

13:14.419 --> 13:17.297
In an emergency,
it's all I know how to do.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.968
That's a real comfort,
coming from a health-care provider.

13:29.059 --> 13:32.563
Dad, I'm sorry.
There was no luck at the pound.

13:33.647 --> 13:37.943
They'll call if they find a dog
matching Eddie's description.

13:39.069 --> 13:41.822
A $500 reward for Eddie?

13:44.199 --> 13:46.827
Are you sure it's enough?

13:48.745 --> 13:52.708
It's about 500 more
than I'd pay to get you back.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.879
Dad, I said I was sorry.

13:57.045 --> 14:00.507
I can't sit here.
I'm going back to the park.

14:00.674 --> 14:03.302
What makes you think
he'll show up there?

14:03.468 --> 14:07.681
That's his hangout. Didn't you have
a place where you met women,

14:07.848 --> 14:09.933
a place where you got lucky?

14:11.685 --> 14:15.480
- Well, I suppose so.
- Didn't you go back?

14:16.565 --> 14:18.609
To the park!

14:19.443 --> 14:23.363
This time we'll comb every inch
of it, every tree, every bush.

14:23.530 --> 14:27.993
- Daphne, we'll need help.
- Call Niles. Tell him we'll pick him up.

14:28.160 --> 14:32.164
Why go into the wild without
one of the great outdoors men?

14:32.331 --> 14:34.833
Oh, this is odd.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.045
I just got a psychic flash about Eddie.

14:38.212 --> 14:41.131
- Well?
- It doesn't make any sense.

14:41.298 --> 14:46.094
All I'm getting is a picture of Eddie
sitting with Dr Crane.

14:46.261 --> 14:50.724
Dr Frasier Crane...
he listens

14:55.354 --> 14:58.273
- Any luck?
- I couldn't find him.

14:58.440 --> 15:02.569
- Where's Niles?
- We split up to cover more ground.

15:03.654 --> 15:08.242
Scrunch down. If Eddie sees
you here, he'll run away again.

15:18.126 --> 15:21.588
Let's call it a night.
You've been here three hours.

15:21.755 --> 15:26.009
I was on a stakeout for 15 hours
without getting out of the car.

15:26.176 --> 15:29.263
We had a contest to see
who'd last longest.

15:29.429 --> 15:33.308
The winner was Canteen McHugh.
Know why we called him that?

15:33.475 --> 15:35.602
I think I can guess.

15:37.229 --> 15:39.398
His bladder was the size of a canteen.

15:39.565 --> 15:41.567
Thank you for clearing that up.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.777
You could have slung it
on your shoulder

15:43.944 --> 15:46.738
and done a 20-mile march
through the desert.

15:46.905 --> 15:49.658
- Big, huh?
- That's what I've been saying.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.747
Close that window! It's freezing!

15:55.914 --> 16:00.002
- It's like a blast furnace.
- At my age, you get cold easily.

16:00.169 --> 16:01.587
Right.

16:04.464 --> 16:09.595
Dad, I've just developed
a very interesting theory about you.

16:10.679 --> 16:14.266
lf I begged you,
would you share it with me?

16:17.060 --> 16:19.688
If that's your attitude, just forget it.

16:20.606 --> 16:22.691
(Car phone rings)

16:24.943 --> 16:26.987
Hello? Oh, Niles.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.781
- Did he find him?
- Just a second.

16:29.948 --> 16:32.743
Let me put you on speakerphone.
Hang on.

16:32.910 --> 16:38.040
- OK. Go ahead, Niles.
- (Niles) 'I'm in the park and I'm lost.

16:42.836 --> 16:46.173
- 'Thank God for my cellular.'
- Did you see Eddie?

16:46.340 --> 16:49.176
'No, but I thought I saw a raccoon.

16:50.260 --> 16:53.805
'When I stopped running,
I had no idea where I was.

16:54.014 --> 16:57.976
- 'You've got to help me.'
- Niles, just remain calm.

16:58.143 --> 17:01.230
Let me think back
to my Boy Scout training.

17:01.396 --> 17:06.568
Now, we're on the northeast
corner of the park.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.862
All right, look into the heavens

17:09.029 --> 17:12.156
and see if you can spot the North Star.

17:12.324 --> 17:14.535
Then you turn 12 degrees...

17:14.701 --> 17:17.496
For God's sake!
Walk towards the horn.

17:17.663 --> 17:20.415
(Car horn beeps)

17:26.380 --> 17:28.632
'I hear it, Dad. I'm walking.'

17:28.799 --> 17:31.218
All right. Just keep following it.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.889
'I see a grove of trees and a fountain

17:36.056 --> 17:40.018
'and a horrible hunchbacked
old man. Stay away from me!

17:42.980 --> 17:45.023
'No. It was just a bush.

17:47.901 --> 17:51.029
'Things are beginning
to look familiar. Keep honking.

17:51.196 --> 17:53.282
(Car horn beeps)

17:53.532 --> 17:57.536
'I think I'm homing in.
I'm quite sure this is the way.'

18:00.622 --> 18:02.708
OK, you can hang up now.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.879
That was a harrowing experience.

18:07.045 --> 18:11.258
A shrub and a raccoon
and you live to tell about it.

18:11.425 --> 18:16.471
Dad, I'm sorry I couldn't find Eddie.
I hope you understand.

18:16.638 --> 18:20.350
I think I'd like to go home now
and hold my wife.

18:20.517 --> 18:24.396
That is, if she'll let me.
I'll just hail a cab.

18:24.563 --> 18:28.108
Call us from the curb
so we know you're safe.

18:36.450 --> 18:39.912
You're probably tired.
If you want to go, it's OK.

18:40.078 --> 18:43.707
That's all right, Dad.
I'll stay for a while longer.

18:49.838 --> 18:53.258
I'm sorry I cut you off like that before.

18:53.425 --> 18:57.095
I've just never gone in
for psychological mumbo jumbo.

18:57.262 --> 19:00.974
Probably started on the force
when we had to see "The Squirrel".

19:01.141 --> 19:02.559
Who?

19:02.726 --> 19:06.188
Dr Bergman. The department shrink.
It was his nickname.

19:06.355 --> 19:09.358
Guys got sent to him
when they got squirrelly.

19:09.525 --> 19:13.237
He'd show you ink blots
and ask about your toilet habits.

19:13.403 --> 19:16.615
I could talk about that
with Nat Dembrowski.

19:16.782 --> 19:19.993
- We nicknamed him the Big...
- Thank you.

19:26.375 --> 19:29.670
Look, it wasn't just Eddie
I was mad about.

19:29.837 --> 19:33.215
Eddie was the straw
that broke the camel's back.

19:33.382 --> 19:37.386
I'm always being told
to take my feet off the furniture,

19:37.553 --> 19:41.306
put a coaster under my beer,
turn the TV down.

19:43.141 --> 19:47.062
I used to make the rules
and now I follow them.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.314
Does this make any sense to you?

19:49.481 --> 19:52.526
Psychologically,
it makes perfect sense.

19:52.693 --> 19:56.363
Slowly your responsibilities
have been taken away from you

19:56.530 --> 20:01.535
and you... Well, you
feel...symbolically castrated.

20:01.702 --> 20:05.998
Why does everything with
you shrinks start in the crotch?

20:06.582 --> 20:08.834
All right, all right.

20:09.001 --> 20:12.421
Well, maybe my rules are too rigid.

20:12.588 --> 20:14.631
Maybe I should relax a little.

20:14.798 --> 20:18.927
No, no. Hey, it's your house.
You do what you want.

20:20.012 --> 20:22.264
I don't know what's bugging me.

20:23.390 --> 20:29.146
I guess it's not easy for a guy
like me to not be in charge.

20:31.732 --> 20:36.236
People confuse not being in charge
with not being respected.

20:37.613 --> 20:40.991
I...hope you're not making that mistake.

20:42.367 --> 20:45.704
Cos you command
a great deal of respect.

20:45.871 --> 20:50.918
Every day I hold myself up
to the Martin Crane yardstick.

20:52.002 --> 20:56.715
I guess a son always
wants to make his father proud.

20:58.717 --> 21:01.011
Yeah, I guess.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.598
So?

21:06.391 --> 21:08.644
Yeah, yeah, you're doing fine.

21:08.810 --> 21:12.064
Even if you are a big pain in the ass.

21:15.609 --> 21:19.905
I don't know if I could have
made Eddie have that operation.

21:20.072 --> 21:24.243
That's a tough thing for a guy
to do to another guy.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.246
Amen to that.

21:35.212 --> 21:37.506
You know, it's getting late.

21:37.673 --> 21:40.384
What do you say
we get some sleep?

21:42.177 --> 21:45.097
Eddie! Come here, boy!

21:47.099 --> 21:49.726
Hey, attaboy! Hey-hey!

21:49.893 --> 21:53.230
Good to see you, fella.
How are you doing?

21:53.397 --> 21:58.819
- Welcome him back.
- Hello, Eddie. Good dog. Oh, wet dog!

21:58.986 --> 22:02.990
You're shivering. Here.
We got to get you warmed up.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.492
Dad,
that's a 100% cashmere pullover!

22:05.617 --> 22:08.245
It's meant to be worn
with the collar up.

22:13.584 --> 22:19.298
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:19.464 --> 22:20.507
# Mercy!

22:20.674 --> 22:27.764
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe, but I got you pegged

22:27.931 --> 22:33.604
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:33.770 --> 22:36.565
# They're calling again #

22:36.732 --> 22:38.775
Thank you.
