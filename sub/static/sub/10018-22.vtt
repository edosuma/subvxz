WEBVTT

00:06.872 --> 00:08.272
Previously on E.R.

00:08.273 --> 00:11.364
Great news, huh, baby?
They dropped the whole thing!

00:11.861 --> 00:14.456
He doesn't belong out there.
He's dangerous.

00:14.657 --> 00:17.448
Getting back at Dad,
stealing his girlfriend?

00:17.749 --> 00:19.995
- She on the list for a liver transplant?
- Status 3.

00:19.996 --> 00:20.996
Move her up to Status 2.

00:21.304 --> 00:23.055
It's the kids.

00:24.210 --> 00:27.782
They never know what's
going on from one day to the next.

00:27.983 --> 00:31.693
- I didn't know you were here.
- Yeah. I'm just getting a little checkup.

00:31.694 --> 00:32.694
- And is it AIDS?
- Yeah. Pneumocystis pneumonia.

00:38.114 --> 00:41.920
"John Carter, M.D."

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.098 --> 01:46.255
- What you got?
- LOL, ALOC. Where do you want her?

01:46.433 --> 01:48.674
Curtain 3. I'll be right there.

01:48.851 --> 01:52.432
Oh, yeah! Turn it up, Jer.

02:02.234 --> 02:04.356
Go, girl, go!

02:04.527 --> 02:06.151
- Have we got a deal?
- I don't know.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.608
If you don't think I should be
an Attending, just say so.

02:08.780 --> 02:11.863
I'm not comfortable with this
bargaining on Susan Lewis' behalf.

02:12.032 --> 02:14.071
- It lacks dignity.
- Way of the world.

02:14.241 --> 02:17.775
What happened to advancement
based solely on merit and ability?

02:17.952 --> 02:19.991
It went out with hoop skirts
and smoking jackets.

02:20.162 --> 02:23.446
- Damn it, Jerry, turn it down!
- So do we have a deal?

02:23.622 --> 02:26.955
Hold on,
it's my favorite part right here.

02:36.797 --> 02:39.880
- Now you can turn it down.
- Thank you.

02:40.049 --> 02:42.373
Sorry, Dr. Weaver,
they made me do it.

02:42.551 --> 02:45.467
Staff meeting starts in four minutes.

02:45.636 --> 02:49.632
So you really think Susan Lewis
can make a good Chief Resident?

02:49.805 --> 02:52.011
Yes, I do.

02:52.182 --> 02:54.636
Okay, then.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.516
What was that all about?

02:56.684 --> 02:59.009
I think I just sold
my soul to the devil.

02:59.186 --> 03:02.351
- What do you got?
- LOL, vitals normal, oriented times zero.

03:02.521 --> 03:04.229
Lady Godiva was au naturel...

03:04.398 --> 03:06.888
...at Buckingham Fountain
singing songs from My Fair Lady.

03:07.066 --> 03:09.105
Carousel.
"June Is Busting Out All Over"...

03:09.276 --> 03:11.314
...is Rogers and Hammerstein,
not Lerner and Loewe.

03:11.485 --> 03:15.482
Just keep her restrained or she's
definitely gonna be busting all over.

03:15.655 --> 03:16.982
And it ain't pretty.

03:17.155 --> 03:21.317
CBC, Chem-7, tox screen,
glucose, non-contrast head CT.

03:22.075 --> 03:26.735
- Ma'am, do you know your name?
- June...

03:26.912 --> 03:31.453
- June? June what?
- Allyson. Allyson.

03:31.623 --> 03:34.623
June Allyson, that's your name?

03:35.625 --> 03:39.372
- Do you know your real name?
- Yes, I know my name.

03:39.544 --> 03:42.994
- It's... I do.
- Don't worry. It's not important.

03:43.172 --> 03:45.840
I know my name, I do...

03:46.007 --> 03:48.331
Probably Alzheimer's.
Call the police.

03:48.508 --> 03:50.998
See if anyone's reported her missing,
a family, a residential home.

03:51.177 --> 03:53.714
She belongs somewhere.
She's too clean to be homeless.

03:53.970 --> 03:58.215
I know, I know, but folks, if we can't
control our office supplies...

03:58.389 --> 04:02.220
...particularly paper expendables,
then Admin will control them for us.

04:02.392 --> 04:06.139
So, please, tell your people,
no unnecessary Xeroxing, okay?

04:06.603 --> 04:09.093
- Okay? Thank you, next item.
- All right.

04:09.271 --> 04:12.306
Replacing Marty Cannon
as an Attending in the ER.

04:12.481 --> 04:14.853
He's done a great job for us.
Thank you, Marty.

04:15.025 --> 04:19.899
But he's leaving for greener
pastures at the University of Iowa.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.735
Godspeed. Godspeed.

04:23.905 --> 04:28.565
As for a replacement, Kerry Weaver
has everybody's vote except for Mark.

04:28.742 --> 04:30.401
You've been dragging your feet on this.

04:30.576 --> 04:34.407
You had a chance to kick this around.
Come to your senses?

04:36.580 --> 04:41.868
- I think Kerry is a terrific choice.
- Oh. Well, that's great.

04:42.041 --> 04:45.041
So you no longer have
any qualms about this?

04:45.210 --> 04:50.001
You'll be together every day, week
after week, pulling on the same oar.

04:50.171 --> 04:51.713
Teammates. Partners.

04:51.881 --> 04:56.257
Seriously, Mark, if you're not excited
about it, I don't see how it can work.

04:56.550 --> 05:01.211
- I'm looking forward to it. Really.
- That's great. Just great.

05:02.471 --> 05:06.337
Well, good. Case closed.
Parking...

05:16.563 --> 05:20.061
- What are you still doing here?
- Timing seemed a little off.

05:20.232 --> 05:22.936
- You'll miss your appointment.
- I can reschedule.

05:23.109 --> 05:24.567
No, you won't.

05:24.735 --> 05:27.818
Bunch of crap anyway. I'm fine.

05:27.987 --> 05:31.022
No, it's not.
You need to see somebody, Shep.

05:31.197 --> 05:35.110
- I don't need to see no shrink.
- The hell you don't!

05:35.283 --> 05:37.607
You're not sleeping,
you're losing weight...

05:37.784 --> 05:39.907
God, I'm terrified
to get in the car with you.

05:40.077 --> 05:41.904
I'm afraid if someone
cuts you off at a light...

05:42.079 --> 05:44.367
...you'll get out and beat them to death
with a tire iron.

05:44.539 --> 05:47.242
You're starting to sound like Reilly.

05:47.415 --> 05:50.534
- He's right.
- What?

05:50.709 --> 05:53.792
- I lied for you to that investigator.
- You didn't lie for me.

05:53.961 --> 05:56.083
Yeah, I did, and I'm not
gonna do it anymore.

05:56.254 --> 05:59.752
No, you didn't lie for me,
and I'm not seeing a shrink.

06:00.757 --> 06:03.508
Shep, you need help!

06:03.675 --> 06:07.624
If you don't get it,
something awful's gonna happen.

06:09.804 --> 06:12.638
You know what I need? I need
for everyone to stop pushing at me.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.474
Pushing at me,
telling me what to do!

06:15.641 --> 06:18.724
I just need a little time, okay?
I mean, is that okay?

06:18.893 --> 06:21.763
Is that okay with you
and the whole city of Chicago?

06:21.937 --> 06:26.811
Shep! It's only because
I care about you. Shep!

07:25.935 --> 07:28.935
Everybody's gonna be there.
My folks, both sets of grandparents...

07:29.103 --> 07:30.930
My sister flew in from Paris.

07:31.105 --> 07:34.354
My godparents, my aunts, my uncles,
a whole bunch of my cousins.

07:34.523 --> 07:38.816
Jeffrey, Jody, Rob, Sarah,
David, Keith, Barry...

07:38.985 --> 07:41.190
- Margaret, Susan...
- Carter, Carter. Okay, look.

07:41.361 --> 07:43.649
I don't need a family tree.
I get the picture.

07:43.821 --> 07:47.319
So I was hoping that you
were maybe gonna come.

07:47.490 --> 07:51.984
It's 4:00. You could stop by
and meet everybody.

07:52.159 --> 07:54.993
Carter, I didn't even go
to my own graduation.

07:55.161 --> 07:57.486
- They've heard a lot about you.
- All good, right?

07:57.663 --> 08:00.413
Absolutely. Nothing but the best,
the very, very best.

08:00.581 --> 08:03.415
If you can't make the graduation,
my dad's throwing a cocktail party...

08:03.583 --> 08:06.666
...at 6 at the Drake.
Good food, great wine.

08:06.835 --> 08:10.997
It'll be my parents' stuffy friends, but
the mayor's supposed to come by...

08:11.171 --> 08:12.713
Carter, you've got your residency.

08:12.881 --> 08:15.797
I've turned in
the end-of-the-year evaluation.

08:15.966 --> 08:18.966
Just relax. You don't have
to try to brown-nose me.

08:19.134 --> 08:24.589
- I wasn't trying to brown-nose you.
- Well, I appreciate your invitation.

08:24.763 --> 08:29.589
But I'm not going to your graduation
or to any cocktail party at the Drake.

08:30.350 --> 08:35.424
Look, you were my assigned med student,
I was your assigned resident.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.927
- You don't owe me anything, okay?
- All right.

08:40.063 --> 08:42.434
All right, what have we got?

08:45.567 --> 08:47.855
- Good morning, Carol.
- What's good about it?

08:48.027 --> 08:52.024
- Kerry, you got it.
- Really? The Attending's job?

08:52.197 --> 08:54.272
That's great! When do I start?

08:54.448 --> 08:57.068
I don't know. I guess after
Marty Cannon leaves next month.

08:57.241 --> 08:59.992
- Is the salary fixed or negotiable?
- Fixed, I guess.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.994
- I didn't negotiate mine.
- There's usually a little wiggle room.

09:03.162 --> 09:05.118
You'd have to discuss that
with Morgenstern.

09:05.288 --> 09:08.822
And benefits? Pension plan through
the hospital or your own 401 K?

09:08.999 --> 09:12.449
- Hospital, I guess. I never asked.
- This is really exciting.

09:12.626 --> 09:15.377
We'll finally be able to facilitate
some real change around here.

09:15.544 --> 09:19.457
Have you read Managing Through Example:
12 Steps to a More Efficient Workplace?

09:19.630 --> 09:21.955
- No, I haven't.
- I'll lend you my copy.

09:22.132 --> 09:23.756
I've highlighted
a number of passages.

09:23.925 --> 09:26.675
- I hope you won't find that distracting.
- I'm sure I won't.

09:26.843 --> 09:31.005
Mark, paramedics are 4 minutes out.
Male infant, respiratory distress.

09:31.179 --> 09:35.092
Kerry, I do have your support,
Susan Lewis as chief, right?

09:35.265 --> 09:39.890
Susan Lewis? You know, Linda Martin
would be awfully good too.

09:40.060 --> 09:42.384
Kerry, we had a deal here.

09:42.561 --> 09:46.688
Mark, I'm kidding.
Where is your sense of humor?

09:49.107 --> 09:51.811
- You wouldn't.
- She isn't.

09:51.984 --> 09:53.892
What are we talking about?

09:54.068 --> 09:56.854
- Weaver's the new Attending.
- Oh, my God!

09:57.028 --> 09:59.234
Don't look at me like that.
She's a good physician...

09:59.405 --> 10:02.358
...a terrific administrator,
and an excellent diagnostician.

10:02.657 --> 10:06.356
It was the right choice.
I'm glad I made it, and that's it.

10:06.534 --> 10:09.949
- Oh, man, it's gonna be a long year.
- It's forever.

10:10.537 --> 10:13.655
Two-day-old male infant,
full term, vaginal delivery.

10:13.831 --> 10:17.033
Found cyanotic in his crib.
Resps 50, heart rate 160.

10:17.208 --> 10:18.405
- When was he born?
- Tuesday night.

10:18.584 --> 10:20.243
- Heel-stick glucose?
- You bet.

10:20.418 --> 10:22.326
- When did he come home?
- Yesterday morning.

10:22.503 --> 10:24.459
-12 hours later?
- They said it was okay.

10:24.629 --> 10:27.582
- We wanted to stay longer.
- He's in heart failure.

10:27.756 --> 10:29.380
- Where's Ross?
- I'll find him.

10:29.549 --> 10:32.833
I'll put in an umbilical line.
Prep 0. 1 Dig.

10:33.009 --> 10:35.677
- Pulse ox 86.
- Sinus tach at 150.

10:35.844 --> 10:38.761
- What's wrong with him?
- His lungs are filled with fluid.

10:38.929 --> 10:41.420
Conni, will you show them
to the waiting room?

10:41.598 --> 10:43.755
- No, I want to stay!
- Come on.

10:43.933 --> 10:46.387
- Come on, honey.
- Dig 0. 1.

10:47.310 --> 10:49.266
- Lasix?
- Yeah, 4 mgs.

10:49.436 --> 10:54.061
ABG, CBC, Chem-7,
chest x-ray and an EKG.

10:54.231 --> 10:57.930
Temp's 98.2, glucose 110.

10:58.108 --> 11:01.191
Somebody sent a mother and a child
home after one night.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.151
Welcome to managed care.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.726
Who gives a damn what
the insurance company wants?

11:05.905 --> 11:08.477
What kind of hospital sends
a newborn home after one night?

11:08.656 --> 11:10.565
Our kind.
Joseph Morgan Randall...

11:10.741 --> 11:14.440
...delivered on the 5th floor
in OB two days ago.

11:20.205 --> 11:23.075
Chuny, could you do me a favor?
I need you to draw some blood.

11:23.249 --> 11:25.917
I'm kind of busy right now.
You can't do it yourself?

11:26.084 --> 11:28.870
- I need you to draw some of my blood.
- Al?

11:29.044 --> 11:31.878
Yeah, I've been putting it off.

11:32.046 --> 11:36.623
- Sure, do you want to do it right now?
- If you don't mind. Nobody's in 4.

12:06.109 --> 12:09.642
Dr. Davitch? I'm John Carter,
med student. I met you once last year.

12:09.819 --> 12:12.902
- I'm on rounds, Mr. Carter.
- Yeah, I can see that.

12:13.071 --> 12:17.317
Talia Lucas, I've been keeping an
eye on her, you moved her last night.

12:17.491 --> 12:20.526
- Yes, I did.
- I thought she was Dr. Berglass' patient.

12:20.701 --> 12:23.487
He's attending his daughter's wedding
in London. I'm covering for him.

12:23.661 --> 12:28.238
- Her ascending cholangitis worsened?
- She's not responding to antibiotics.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.782
I'm worried about Pseudomonas,
so I moved her up to the ICU...

12:31.958 --> 12:35.408
...and I jumped her to Status 1
on the transplant list.

12:35.585 --> 12:37.910
- Do you know her parents?
- Yeah.

12:38.087 --> 12:40.162
They're in the waiting room.
Why don't you join me.

12:40.338 --> 12:44.548
- They don't know yet?
- It's been a busy morning, Mr. Carter.

12:44.716 --> 12:47.834
Hey, everybody. Miss me?
Oh, a little one.

12:48.010 --> 12:52.586
Two days. Cyanotic in the crib,
no detectable murmur, CHF.

12:52.762 --> 12:56.545
- Dig and Lasix, with no improvement.
- Pulse is up to 200.

12:56.765 --> 13:00.014
Mother gave birth Tuesday night.
OB kicked her out Wednesday morning.

13:00.184 --> 13:03.100
- Get an EKG?
- Right axis deviation.

13:03.269 --> 13:06.601
RAH, RVH, no Q-wave in V6.

13:06.771 --> 13:10.898
Hyperventilate him. Get an amp of
Prostin VR down here now, please.

13:11.066 --> 13:13.935
- What the hell is it?
- Hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

13:14.109 --> 13:16.943
- They sent her home the next morning?
- Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.

13:17.111 --> 13:19.269
Damn it.
All right, let's get an echo.

13:19.446 --> 13:22.149
Find out who's on call
for Pediatric Cardiology, please.

13:22.322 --> 13:24.314
Is he gonna make it?

13:24.490 --> 13:26.613
If we keep the ductus arteriosus open,
he's got a shot.

13:26.784 --> 13:28.941
Son of a bitch!

13:30.536 --> 13:33.405
Mr. and Mrs. Lucas?
Hi, I'm Dr. Davitch.

13:33.579 --> 13:35.951
Dr. Berglass is out of the country
for a few days.

13:36.123 --> 13:38.660
You already know Mr. Carter,
I believe.

13:38.833 --> 13:41.323
They told us T.C. had been moved
to Intensive Care.

13:41.501 --> 13:44.620
Unfortunately, your daughter's
condition has worsened overnight.

13:44.795 --> 13:47.629
She's not responding
to the antibiotics.

13:47.797 --> 13:51.330
I don't have much confidence that
her liver will function much longer.

13:51.507 --> 13:55.634
So we have moved her from Status 2
to Status 1 on the transplant list.

13:55.802 --> 13:58.801
We're gonna do everything we can
for her while we wait.

13:58.970 --> 14:00.962
So she'll get
the transplant operation soon?

14:01.138 --> 14:05.300
- That will certainly be our hope.
- How soon?

14:08.309 --> 14:12.436
Mr. Carter, you're familiar with
the UNIS procedure, aren't you?

14:12.604 --> 14:18.272
Mr. Carter will answer your questions
and take you back to see your daughter.

14:20.817 --> 14:23.603
Why don't we take a seat?

14:23.986 --> 14:26.855
D.A. is open,
so he's still got a fighting chance.

14:28.572 --> 14:31.987
I'm gonna go tell his parents.
This is unbelievable.

14:32.157 --> 14:35.691
There is an ugly, vicious rumor
going around. Kerry Weaver...

14:35.868 --> 14:37.492
- Don't start with me.
- So it's true.

14:37.661 --> 14:40.281
What is everyone so upset about?
Kerry Weaver's not that bad.

14:40.454 --> 14:42.363
- She's great.
- She grows on you.

14:42.539 --> 14:44.412
You been hitting the Prozac again?

14:44.582 --> 14:47.866
I got a call from a pharmacy
on the North Side looking for you.

14:48.042 --> 14:51.125
You gave a prescription
for a hundred Percodan.

14:51.294 --> 14:53.286
Karen Hines. Isn't that
that redhead you been seeing?

14:53.462 --> 14:56.332
- Yeah, she's got a bad knee.
- A hundred? Pretty bad knee.

14:56.506 --> 14:58.628
She travels a lot, doesn't know
when she'll be able to get them.

14:58.799 --> 15:00.921
Mark, I need you in there.
Rule out Ml.

15:01.092 --> 15:06.250
- You told them it was okay?
- Yeah, I told them you'd call.

15:06.679 --> 15:08.470
Damn...

15:09.139 --> 15:11.177
Jeanie!

15:11.348 --> 15:14.348
- Hi.
- Hi. How did your appointment go?

15:14.517 --> 15:18.015
- They gave me a bunch of stuff to read.
- You should read it.

15:19.520 --> 15:22.354
Thanks for staying last night.

15:22.522 --> 15:27.478
It's tough the first night
home from the hospital.

15:27.650 --> 15:31.065
My health plan
assigned me a doctor.

15:32.028 --> 15:37.068
- A Dr. Arabian. You know him?
- No. I'll ask around.

15:37.615 --> 15:39.025
Thanks.

15:39.199 --> 15:45.033
He said that my CD4 count is 450.

15:45.453 --> 15:49.117
- He sounded excited about that.
- Yeah, that's good.

15:49.706 --> 15:52.278
What is it supposed to be?

15:53.375 --> 15:56.458
Fifteen hundred.

15:58.336 --> 16:01.668
He gave me a lot of stuff.

16:03.547 --> 16:08.042
AZT, something called 3TC
and Sacinaver.

16:08.217 --> 16:12.165
- Saquinavir.
- Whatever. It's gonna cost a fortune.

16:12.345 --> 16:14.835
And...

16:15.388 --> 16:20.725
...he gave me a couple
of packets of condoms too.

16:22.309 --> 16:25.973
Kind of seems like the horse
is out of the barn on that one.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.226
- It was a joke.
- It wasn't funny.

16:37.485 --> 16:41.149
- You get tested yet?
- Yeah. It's not back yet.

16:46.616 --> 16:52.533
The doctor said I may have been
HIV-positive for as long as 10 years.

16:53.370 --> 16:57.201
He wants me to make a list
of all my...

16:58.248 --> 17:02.031
...past sexual contacts,
let them know.

17:02.459 --> 17:06.538
- It's gonna be quite a list.
- That's not much to be proud of now.

17:07.295 --> 17:09.417
Wasn't much to be proud of then.

17:15.092 --> 17:19.752
Well, I better go home.
I got a lot of reading to do.

17:24.638 --> 17:27.592
If that baby'd stayed in the hospital,
somebody would've picked up on it.

17:27.766 --> 17:29.805
Most babies are fine
going home the next day.

17:29.976 --> 17:32.264
A lot of problems don't
declare themselves right away.

17:32.436 --> 17:34.973
- Intussusception, pyloric stenosis.
- People trust us.

17:35.146 --> 17:37.517
The woman took her baby home
because we told her it was safe.

17:37.689 --> 17:41.436
Every dollar we spend
on a healthy postpartum mother...

17:41.608 --> 17:44.608
...is another dollar we don't have
to help someone else.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.743
There's something
you don't see every day.

18:02.955 --> 18:06.287
- I thought she was in restraints.
- She was.

18:06.999 --> 18:10.283
- Malik, could you give me a hand?
- Do I have to?

18:20.924 --> 18:23.249
Hold that elevator!

18:30.514 --> 18:35.221
- Dr. Benton.
- Dr. Vucelich.

18:39.436 --> 18:42.601
Congratulations on being named
Resident of the Year.

18:42.771 --> 18:46.720
Thank you. I understand that you
were instrumental in my selection.

18:46.899 --> 18:51.524
No, I merely expressed my opinion.
Glad that others concurred.

18:53.445 --> 18:58.899
- I read your aortic aneurism study.
- Yes, it's been very well received.

18:59.073 --> 19:02.322
The drug company granted the hospital
over 3 million dollars...

19:02.492 --> 19:06.274
...for Phase 4 trials,
additional research facilities...

19:06.744 --> 19:10.741
You know, I...

19:10.914 --> 19:13.238
I couldn't help but notice
the inclusion...

19:13.415 --> 19:17.411
...of the negative-outcome patients
that we discussed.

19:18.210 --> 19:21.412
It seemed prudent course,
given the circumstances.

19:21.587 --> 19:25.666
They weren't, however, statistically
significant in the final analysis.

19:26.340 --> 19:29.873
Well, I was glad
to see them there anyway.

19:30.051 --> 19:32.457
Yes, I'm sure you were.

19:35.471 --> 19:39.087
- Carter... Armani?
- Hugo Boss.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.340
Nice.

19:41.516 --> 19:45.429
The parents of that kid with liver
failure called. They had some questions.

19:45.602 --> 19:48.353
Some more questions.
I spent an hour with them this morning.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.722
I'm supposed to meet my folks
at Trotter's for lunch in 20 minutes.

19:51.897 --> 19:54.933
- They called three times?
- Five. I quit writing it down.

19:55.108 --> 19:58.606
If they call again, tell them I'll be up
later. My father hates it when I'm late.

19:58.777 --> 20:00.436
Mr. Carter, you got a minute?

20:00.611 --> 20:03.101
I'm completing the assignments
for the first-year surgical interns.

20:03.280 --> 20:06.114
We're breaking all the surgical residents
into teams next year.

20:06.281 --> 20:08.653
You indicated on
your application form...

20:08.825 --> 20:11.824
...that you're interested in Vascular,
Neurosurgery and Plastics rotations?

20:11.993 --> 20:13.368
- Absolutely.
- Good.

20:13.536 --> 20:15.943
- I've got one spot left on the red team.
- Really?

20:16.121 --> 20:18.575
It'll be primarily second-
and third-year residents...

20:18.747 --> 20:21.783
...but seeing as you're
our only locally-grown prodigy...

20:21.958 --> 20:23.950
...we'll give you
the home field advantage.

20:24.126 --> 20:26.616
- It'll be quite a leg up on your peers.
- I'd be honored.

20:26.794 --> 20:30.577
Dr. Langdon will be your supervising
resident. Do you know Nancy?

20:30.755 --> 20:34.621
Sure, she's great. So I won't be
working under Dr. Benton anymore?

20:34.799 --> 20:37.882
No, Dr. Benton will be anchoring
the blue team next year.

20:38.051 --> 20:41.798
General surgery, the ER, proctology,
real meat-and-potato stuff.

20:41.970 --> 20:44.425
Unless you'd rather be with Benton?

20:44.597 --> 20:47.550
- No, I was hoping for the red team.
- Good. Excellent.

20:47.724 --> 20:50.392
- Dr. Morgenstern.
- Peter.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.768
- Weaver will support you as chief.
- Really? We should talk about that.

20:55.937 --> 20:58.427
- Dr. Greene, your wife called.
- Ex-wife.

20:58.605 --> 21:01.973
Right. She said you're late for lunch.
She's mad as hell.

21:02.149 --> 21:05.315
With Weaver onboard, it's a lock.
You wanna have dinner and celebrate?

21:05.485 --> 21:07.311
I don't know. Check with me later.

21:08.487 --> 21:10.478
- Mr. Brannigan?
- Kenny, please.

21:10.655 --> 21:12.979
I'm Dr. Lewis.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

21:13.156 --> 21:15.777
At least she stopped singing.

21:15.950 --> 21:19.613
- So you've had a persistent cough?
- For a couple of months.

21:19.785 --> 21:22.785
- Coughing up any blood?
- No. Well, not much.

21:22.954 --> 21:26.820
- But some.
- Once or twice. No big deal.

21:26.998 --> 21:29.951
I pour concrete for a living,
so stuff gets in your lungs.

21:30.125 --> 21:31.998
- Are you a smoker, Kenny?
- Yeah.

21:32.168 --> 21:36.662
- You're not gonna lecture me?
- It's not like I have to.

21:36.838 --> 21:39.707
- So how much do you smoke?
- A couple of packs a day.

21:39.881 --> 21:42.632
- Sometimes more, sometimes less.
-120 over 80.

21:42.800 --> 21:46.002
When was the last time
you had a tuberculosis test?

21:46.177 --> 21:50.125
- I don't go to doctors much.
- All that lecturing, I guess.

21:55.724 --> 21:57.681
Sorry I'm late.

21:57.851 --> 22:01.847
- Like old times.
- Nice to see you too.

22:02.020 --> 22:04.391
If this is about getting Rachel
this weekend, you can forget it...

22:04.563 --> 22:06.804
...because I got tickets
for the Cubbies on Saturday.

22:07.648 --> 22:10.731
- Rachel hates baseball.
- That's not true.

22:12.276 --> 22:14.849
This weekend's fine, Mark.
That's fine.

22:15.528 --> 22:19.690
- You gonna finish those fries?
- Go right ahead.

22:19.864 --> 22:24.192
I can't eat this food. This place
should have been shut down years ago.

22:24.367 --> 22:26.655
The hospital fights to keep it open.
It's good for business.

22:28.203 --> 22:32.033
Food poisoning, stomach pumping,
gastroenteritis.

22:32.205 --> 22:34.530
This joint's a gold mine.

22:34.707 --> 22:37.991
Craig and I are getting married.

22:38.167 --> 22:40.836
- What?
- In September.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.999
You're kidding.

22:45.172 --> 22:47.744
I didn't want you to hear it
from Rachel.

22:47.923 --> 22:49.714
Rachel knows?

22:49.883 --> 22:52.551
She's excited.
She's helping me pick out a dress.

22:52.718 --> 22:56.880
Something non-traditional, I hope.
Perhaps in red.

22:57.721 --> 22:59.594
I knew you weren't
gonna be happy about this...

22:59.764 --> 23:03.345
...but I thought
I should be the one to tell you.

23:08.228 --> 23:11.476
You should've kept the goatee.
It made you look dangerous.

23:27.281 --> 23:29.107
Hey!

23:29.282 --> 23:31.239
Hey yourself!

23:31.409 --> 23:34.408
- School let out early?
- Well, I was on all night.

23:34.577 --> 23:36.902
Looks like you're still
gainfully employed.

23:37.079 --> 23:38.323
I'm on probation.

23:38.496 --> 23:41.117
I lose another 250 grand,
I'm back to card counting in Vegas.

23:41.290 --> 23:44.740
- Really, you did that?
- In a previous lifetime. Don't ask.

23:44.917 --> 23:47.241
So how's your knee?

23:47.752 --> 23:51.583
It's okay. How's yours?

23:54.381 --> 23:57.796
The prescription that I wrote out
for the Percodan...

23:57.967 --> 24:00.089
...was for 10 tablets.

24:00.260 --> 24:03.425
You know, I wondered about that.
The damned things cost me a fortune.

24:03.595 --> 24:06.963
So you didn't change it to a hundred?

24:07.139 --> 24:09.427
No, I didn't.

24:11.225 --> 24:15.601
Prescription pads for narcotics,
they come in triplicate.

24:15.769 --> 24:18.342
I can check my copy.

24:18.521 --> 24:22.600
- Maybe you should do that.
- Maybe I should.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.942
Count them, boyfriend.
They're all there.

24:36.324 --> 24:39.028
- I don't need to count them.
- Sure you do.

24:50.249 --> 24:53.083
Mr. Brannigan, sorry it took so long.

24:53.835 --> 24:56.788
- Do you have a personal physician?
- No.

24:58.838 --> 25:01.126
You have a density in your left lung.

25:02.757 --> 25:05.792
- Tuberculosis?
- I don't think so.

25:06.593 --> 25:09.795
- Cancer.
- We need more tests to rule that out.

25:10.637 --> 25:13.802
How much are these tests
of yours gonna cost?

25:13.972 --> 25:16.213
Do you have insurance?

25:17.099 --> 25:20.514
No, I work construction for a lot
of different companies. No benefits.

25:20.685 --> 25:24.467
- Maybe you qualify for Medicaid?
- When my last kid was born, we didn't.

25:24.645 --> 25:27.978
It cost me a couple of grand.
Still trying to pay that off.

25:28.148 --> 25:31.895
Well, I can't tell you exactly
how much the tests will cost.

25:32.067 --> 25:35.232
We could get someone down from
Admitting, if you have any questions.

25:35.402 --> 25:38.437
I got a couple of kids
and a mortgage.

25:38.612 --> 25:40.651
And I'm just scraping by as it is.

25:40.822 --> 25:45.648
You have a potentially serious condition
which needs immediate evaluation.

25:48.202 --> 25:51.616
Mr. Brannigan,
you really need to stay here.

25:53.997 --> 25:56.569
- Mark, Loretta's back.
- Oh, no. What this time?

25:56.749 --> 25:59.037
I think she's frightened and
overwhelmed by the surgery.

25:59.209 --> 26:01.995
They only released her yesterday.
I started an IV. She's in 4.

26:02.169 --> 26:05.418
Tell her I'll be down as soon as I can.
Make sure that she's comfortable.

26:05.588 --> 26:08.706
- So we're just gonna let him leave?
- Do you want to tackle the guy?

26:08.881 --> 26:11.502
He said that he can't afford it.
Who am I to say that he can?

26:11.675 --> 26:15.718
A full course of chemo and radiation
will cost him minimum fifty grand.

26:15.886 --> 26:17.510
I don't understand
what we're arguing about.

26:17.678 --> 26:20.631
You let the hospital bill him. He can
declare bankruptcy if he has to.

26:20.805 --> 26:22.844
And if he dies, he leaves his wife
and children in bankruptcy?

26:23.015 --> 26:24.473
At least he wouldn't be dead.

26:24.641 --> 26:29.385
I advised him to stay, he chose
to leave. That's his prerogative.

26:42.360 --> 26:46.357
- What are you doing out here?
- Enjoying the fresh air and sunshine.

26:46.530 --> 26:51.190
Last few months, whenever I can,
I like to get outside.

26:51.366 --> 26:57.034
- It's about time you gave those up.
- My last vice.

26:57.203 --> 27:00.072
- So they sent you home yesterday.
- Yeah.

27:00.246 --> 27:03.448
- I don't think I was ready.
- Been able to eat anything?

27:03.749 --> 27:06.784
I haven't been able
to keep anything down.

27:06.959 --> 27:10.907
- How are the kids?
- Hell on wheels.

27:12.296 --> 27:15.212
- I wanted to ask you something.
- Shoot.

27:15.381 --> 27:19.459
I was wondering if you'd
be guardian to my kids.

27:20.134 --> 27:23.134
Not that anything bad
is ever gonna happen to me.

27:23.302 --> 27:28.259
It's just that they don't have anybody.
My folks are dead. They like you.

27:28.431 --> 27:33.221
I know it's a lot to ask.
But they're really good kids.

27:38.062 --> 27:42.224
- What about their father?
- Fathers. Plural.

27:42.398 --> 27:46.264
Good luck. I never could
quite figure that one out.

27:46.442 --> 27:51.896
You don't have to answer now,
I have time. At least a little bit, I think.

27:56.615 --> 27:59.947
- I'm honored you'd ask...
- But you can't.

28:00.117 --> 28:03.781
No, I can't. Sorry.

28:05.996 --> 28:09.161
Besides, you're gonna make it.

28:11.165 --> 28:14.249
Damn right I am.

28:22.089 --> 28:25.338
- Hey, you're up. How are you feeling?
- Kind of tired.

28:25.508 --> 28:27.962
Where are your folks?
They were looking for me earlier.

28:28.134 --> 28:30.256
They went downstairs
to get something to eat.

28:30.761 --> 28:32.800
In the cafeteria? Big mistake.

28:33.763 --> 28:36.335
My mom just kept crying.

28:36.515 --> 28:40.013
I think my Dad was worried
she was gonna scare me.

28:40.183 --> 28:42.674
Well, tell them I stopped by.
I gotta go.

28:42.852 --> 28:44.974
I'm graduating in half an hour
and I'm late.

28:45.145 --> 28:48.844
Everybody in here looks pretty sick.

28:49.022 --> 28:52.971
Yeah, well, they get better.
It just takes time.

28:53.150 --> 28:58.355
The boy who was in that bed,
I don't think he got better.

29:02.197 --> 29:05.113
Am I gonna die?

29:07.450 --> 29:09.110
You're very sick, T.C.

29:09.285 --> 29:13.411
My mom says I'm Status 1.
What does that mean?

29:14.163 --> 29:17.696
That means that as soon as the next
liver's available, you get first dibs.

29:18.791 --> 29:21.162
Somebody has to die, right?

29:22.251 --> 29:24.326
- Yeah.
- Kind of weird.

29:24.878 --> 29:28.577
There's kids out there,
and they're okay.

29:28.755 --> 29:31.790
And I'm here waiting for
something bad to happen to them.

29:32.966 --> 29:36.797
You're not making
that bad thing happen.

29:40.346 --> 29:45.551
- I gotta go. I'll see you later.
- How long till I have an operation?

29:47.392 --> 29:50.760
Could be a week, could be two,
could be less.

29:51.228 --> 29:53.433
Could be anytime.

29:53.604 --> 29:56.853
What if nothing bad happens
to anybody this week?

29:57.982 --> 29:59.475
It will.

29:59.649 --> 30:03.811
Unfortunately, something bad is always
happening to somebody, somewhere.

30:04.319 --> 30:06.987
Like what's happening to me, right?

30:13.616 --> 30:17.031
Want me to stay for a little while,
till your folks come back?

30:17.202 --> 30:20.285
Yeah, that'd be great.
If it's okay.

30:20.454 --> 30:22.861
Sure, I can be
a couple of minutes late.

30:25.540 --> 30:28.161
Oh, man, this day just
gets worse and worse.

30:28.334 --> 30:31.038
Hey, Mark. Linda Martin?
Was she the only choice?

30:31.211 --> 30:33.203
- I think she's kind of a bitch.
- For what?

30:33.379 --> 30:35.703
- Chief Resident.
- She is kind of a bitch.

30:35.880 --> 30:38.666
Linda Martin is not gonna be
Chief Resident. Don't worry about it.

30:38.840 --> 30:41.330
She is gonna be chief.
It's on the memo.

30:42.593 --> 30:44.750
Damn it!

30:46.095 --> 30:50.471
- Jerry! Where the hell is Weaver?
- Trauma 1.

30:56.685 --> 30:58.511
You said you'd support
Susan for chief.

30:58.686 --> 31:00.725
Julio Cadena, meet Mark Greene.

31:00.896 --> 31:03.849
Mr. Cadena's small intestine
seems to be eviscerated.

31:04.023 --> 31:06.145
- IV's wide open.
- We had a deal.

31:06.316 --> 31:08.521
Rapid infuse 4 units of O-neg.

31:08.692 --> 31:11.526
I offered it to her, she turned it down.

31:11.694 --> 31:14.860
- She what?
- Ask her yourself.

31:15.029 --> 31:19.855
Gram of cefoxatin IV, alert the O.R.,
page Benton to get down here.

31:31.581 --> 31:33.906
- Hey, Peter.
- Hi.

31:34.083 --> 31:37.083
- Got a minute?
- Sure.

31:42.213 --> 31:45.047
Al's got AIDS.

31:46.716 --> 31:49.206
- Conni, give us a moment, will you?
- I'm just after some coffee.

31:49.384 --> 31:52.586
I'll bring you a cup
in a few minutes, all right?

31:54.804 --> 31:57.638
Sure. Cream, no sugar.

32:02.267 --> 32:04.555
I got tested today,
but I don't have the results.

32:04.727 --> 32:08.853
I know what you're thinking, because I
was where you are now a few days ago.

32:09.021 --> 32:13.064
You want to feel concern for me, but
you are wondering, "What about me? "

32:13.232 --> 32:17.181
Al and I barely had sex, much less
a marriage these last few years.

32:17.485 --> 32:20.853
You and I were careful,
but not that careful.

32:24.031 --> 32:26.699
Get tested. I'm sorry.

32:33.620 --> 32:36.536
12-year-old girl hit by a city bus
while riding her bicycle.

32:36.705 --> 32:39.030
Complaining of pain in left ankle.
Obvious deformed fracture.

32:39.207 --> 32:42.041
Good distal pulses, no head or chest pain.
She was wearing a helmet.

32:42.209 --> 32:46.916
- Gently now.
- IV saline TKO, 0.25 liters cannula.

32:47.087 --> 32:49.577
Three mgs morphine in the field.
Name's Monique.

32:49.755 --> 32:52.126
- It hurts!
- I know it does, honey.

32:52.298 --> 32:54.788
- Does your neck hurt?
- No.

32:54.966 --> 32:57.503
- Any tenderness?
- No, no, just my leg!

32:57.676 --> 33:00.249
You were wearing your helmet,
Monique. That's really good.

33:01.137 --> 33:03.674
- Do your parents know you're here?
- No.

33:03.847 --> 33:08.388
If you give me your phone number,
I can call them so they come, okay?

33:08.933 --> 33:12.716
Good dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibial pulses.

33:12.894 --> 33:15.515
- BP 90 over 60.
- Pulse ox 99.

33:15.688 --> 33:19.766
Let's get an ice pack, an H & H,
and dip the urine for blood.

33:19.940 --> 33:22.810
My sister is gonna be so mad at me.

33:22.984 --> 33:25.853
- She'll just be happy you're okay.
- No!

33:26.027 --> 33:28.352
Sure she will, sweetheart.

33:28.529 --> 33:31.363
Let's get a left ankle, tib-fib films...

33:31.573 --> 33:35.818
...and give her another
three morphine for the pain.

33:36.242 --> 33:39.361
Dr. Randa Jane Berkowitz.

33:51.585 --> 33:54.585
Dr. John Truman Carter.

34:01.925 --> 34:03.751
Dr. Carter!

34:04.343 --> 34:06.251
Well...

34:07.178 --> 34:11.719
Dr. Carter must have found a facial
laceration to practice a z-plasty on.

34:15.141 --> 34:18.306
Dr. Ming Wu Chang...

34:23.480 --> 34:25.436
Two, three, flip.

34:25.606 --> 34:28.061
- You taking them off the top?
- Yes, I am.

34:28.233 --> 34:30.687
Flip, go. Okay, one more time.
Two out of three.

34:30.859 --> 34:33.645
- You already lost five times.
- Yeah, but I'm getting better.

34:34.987 --> 34:38.568
- She always wins.
- Thanks for staying with her.

34:39.364 --> 34:41.024
- How's she doing?
- I'm okay.

34:41.199 --> 34:42.858
Yeah, she's hanging in there.

34:43.449 --> 34:46.071
I hope you didn't
have to be anywhere.

34:46.244 --> 34:50.784
No, not anymore.
I'm gonna go and then come back...

34:50.955 --> 34:54.370
...make sure you're not
getting into too much trouble.

34:54.541 --> 34:57.209
Thanks.

34:57.584 --> 34:59.457
Hi, sweetheart.

35:02.629 --> 35:05.166
Comminuted trimalleolar ankle fracture.
What a mess.

35:05.339 --> 35:07.794
- Definitely unstable.
- Yeah. Gonna need surgery.

35:08.049 --> 35:10.041
- Are her parents here?
- In the waiting room.

35:10.217 --> 35:13.003
Monique was right about her sister.
She was mad about the bike.

35:13.177 --> 35:15.216
Splint her leg, I'll call an ambulance
to move her.

35:15.387 --> 35:17.011
Move her where?

35:17.180 --> 35:20.133
Her insurance company wants her
transferred to Midway.

35:20.307 --> 35:22.298
I can't apply a plaster splint
without moving the ankle.

35:22.475 --> 35:24.134
- It'll hurt like hell!
- We'll medicate her.

35:24.309 --> 35:26.515
- Do her parents know about this?
- I'll tell them now.

35:26.686 --> 35:29.140
Mark, we're gonna splint
an unstable ankle fracture...

35:29.312 --> 35:32.182
...send a 12-year-old girl across town
for an operation we can do upstairs?

35:32.356 --> 35:35.024
I don't like this more than you do,
but that's what the insurance wants.

35:35.191 --> 35:38.973
- I thought you were the doctor!
- I am the doctor.

35:39.152 --> 35:42.354
But if I admit her here,
her parents will get slapped...

35:42.529 --> 35:45.482
...with a bill
for tens of thousands of dollars.

35:45.656 --> 35:47.612
- I quit!
- What?

35:47.782 --> 35:50.189
I quit!

35:53.327 --> 35:56.197
- You can't just leave.
- Watch me!

35:58.289 --> 36:00.364
We send a newborn home
with a congenital heart problem.

36:00.540 --> 36:04.322
A guy comes in with lung cancer,
he can't afford the treatment.

36:04.501 --> 36:06.872
Now we're shipping kids across
town with unstable fractures.

36:07.044 --> 36:08.703
Don't give me
that holier-than-thou crap!

36:08.878 --> 36:13.088
We also treated a couple hundred
others who had nowhere else to go.

36:13.256 --> 36:15.213
You're gonna feel stupid about this
in the morning!

36:15.382 --> 36:19.592
I'm gonna feel great about this
in the morning!

36:32.310 --> 36:36.176
- Are you okay, Dr. Benton?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

36:36.854 --> 36:40.518
Have you seen Dr. Morgenstern?
He wanted to talk with me.

36:40.690 --> 36:44.022
He started a ruptured appendix
about a half-hour ago.

36:44.192 --> 36:46.860
Well, I'll catch up to him tomorrow.

36:47.027 --> 36:50.477
- How was your cocktail party?
- I missed it.

36:50.654 --> 36:53.358
- You missed your own party?
- Yeah.

36:53.531 --> 36:55.902
My parents had a good time anyway.

36:56.074 --> 36:59.193
It was mostly their friends.
I missed my graduation too.

36:59.910 --> 37:03.112
- Really?
- Yeah. You missed yours, right?

37:05.872 --> 37:11.244
- What were you doing?
- An emergency hemorrhoidectomy.

37:13.252 --> 37:17.378
- What were you doing?
- Playing cards with a scared little kid.

37:17.671 --> 37:21.881
TC, that little girl with liver failure.
They moved her up to Status 1.

37:22.049 --> 37:25.879
I was just keeping her company
while her folks talked to the doctor.

37:30.721 --> 37:33.886
Now you're the doctor.

37:35.515 --> 37:38.385
You graduated, right?

37:38.559 --> 37:41.594
Yeah, that's right, I am.

37:43.520 --> 37:46.722
It's kind of weird. I...

37:48.065 --> 37:51.148
I don't know any more
than I knew this morning.

37:52.943 --> 37:55.777
I really wanted to graduate too.
Well...

38:01.407 --> 38:03.944
Anyway...

38:10.787 --> 38:13.740
Take care of yourself, Carter.

38:21.919 --> 38:23.958
Right.

38:43.558 --> 38:46.427
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

38:46.893 --> 38:51.020
- Carol Hathaway just quit.
- I heard. What was that all about?

38:51.187 --> 38:53.226
You got me.

38:54.148 --> 38:57.183
- You turned down chief?
- Yes, I did.

38:59.109 --> 39:01.397
I agreed to support Kerry Weaver
as Attending...

39:01.569 --> 39:03.810
...because she agreed
to support you as chief.

39:06.572 --> 39:10.438
- I didn't ask you to do that.
- No, you didn't.

39:11.200 --> 39:15.113
My whole life I've always done
what everyone else wanted me to do.

39:15.286 --> 39:19.613
Today I had this guy come in with
a cough. Lung cancer, 46 years old.

39:19.788 --> 39:21.745
I get one of these cases
every couple of months.

39:21.831 --> 39:25.413
Children, husbands, wives...
Their faces all start to blend together.

39:25.584 --> 39:29.995
But it hit me: How long do we have?
Any of us?

39:30.170 --> 39:32.625
And how are we gonna fill that time?

39:33.630 --> 39:37.923
I had something. Little Susie.

39:38.759 --> 39:43.419
And now I don't.
All I have is this. Work.

39:43.595 --> 39:48.753
You know what, Mark?
That's not enough.

40:06.151 --> 40:09.649
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

40:09.820 --> 40:12.570
You don't have your keys?

40:13.155 --> 40:17.317
- Why are you still wearing your scrubs?
- I quit.

40:17.866 --> 40:20.783
- You're kidding.
- No, to hell with them.

40:21.035 --> 40:25.410
- You can't quit! You're great at it.
- I'm sick of it.

40:25.579 --> 40:27.951
They kept cutting back my shifts,
making me work more nights.

40:28.748 --> 40:32.032
I'll make more doing home care
or per diem.

40:35.169 --> 40:38.168
You're never gonna see that shrink,
are you?

40:45.967 --> 40:48.836
Why couldn't we just keep going
the way we were?

40:50.386 --> 40:54.632
I was happy.
Were you happy?

40:54.806 --> 40:59.798
Things change.
It's not my fault, it's not your fault.

41:01.768 --> 41:06.725
Raul died. It's a terrible thing,
but something happened to you, Shep.

41:06.897 --> 41:11.308
You know it's true.
You gotta deal with it.

41:12.358 --> 41:15.109
- I'm doing okay.
- No, you're not.

41:26.367 --> 41:28.904
I can't do this, Shep.

41:31.579 --> 41:35.444
I have finally gotten my life together.
It's taken me a long time.

41:41.460 --> 41:44.163
You need help.

41:46.338 --> 41:49.041
I love you, but you need help.

41:49.214 --> 41:53.045
And if you can't get it together
to get that help...

41:54.093 --> 41:56.417
...I can't be with you.

42:03.890 --> 42:05.432
I can't.

42:43.373 --> 42:46.823
- Jennifer's getting married again.
- Really? That was quick.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.534
I was hoping to be the first one to get
remarried, at least live with someone.

42:50.711 --> 42:53.283
It makes me seem kind of pathetic,
don't you think?

42:53.463 --> 42:54.837
She's planning her guest list...

42:55.005 --> 42:57.293
...and I'm still fumbling around
with pick-up lines in singles bars.

42:57.465 --> 42:59.587
It gets you off the hook
with the alimony, though.

42:59.758 --> 43:02.427
I wasn't paying any.
She makes more money than I do.

43:02.593 --> 43:06.175
- I never really liked her.
- You acted like you did.

43:06.346 --> 43:09.299
I just did that to make you feel better.
I never cared for her.

43:09.473 --> 43:12.971
She's unsupportive,
controlling, manipulative...

43:13.142 --> 43:15.299
- You want me to go on?
- Please, I'm enjoying it.

43:15.476 --> 43:17.764
Demanding, skinny legs...

43:17.936 --> 43:21.019
- Why were you looking at my wife's legs?
- I'm your buddy, I'm not dead.

43:21.188 --> 43:25.101
- I'm just saying you can do better.
- Thanks. Thank you.

43:25.274 --> 43:29.222
Listen to this, I talked to Karen
about the Percodan.

43:29.402 --> 43:32.485
- You didn't prescribe that many?
- The prescription was for 10.

43:32.654 --> 43:35.856
- What did she say?
- She denied it, said it was a mix-up.

43:36.031 --> 43:38.603
And she gave them back,
actually she threw them back at me.

43:38.782 --> 43:41.652
- Do you believe her?
- I don't know.

43:41.826 --> 43:43.782
Get away from her,
she sounds like trouble.

43:43.952 --> 43:47.402
- Yeah, you're right, I probably should.
- But you're not going to?

43:47.580 --> 43:50.947
- She's kind of cute.
- Well, she's got great legs.

43:51.123 --> 43:54.989
- You look at my girlfriend's legs?
- I'm your friend, I'm not dead.

43:55.168 --> 43:58.701
- What else did you notice about her?
- You want a list?

44:05.049 --> 44:07.206
Dr. Morgenstern,
you were looking for me?

44:07.384 --> 44:09.257
Yeah, we missed you at graduation.
Where were you?

44:09.426 --> 44:11.134
With a patient.
How was the ceremony?

44:11.303 --> 44:16.010
One of the best in years. Pomp and
circumstance, all the trimmings.

44:16.181 --> 44:19.797
If you'll excuse me, it's very late,
and I'm finally on my way home.

44:19.975 --> 44:23.307
I was wondering if it's too late to
change my choice for team next year.

44:23.477 --> 44:25.136
I was hoping to sign up
for the blue team.

44:25.311 --> 44:27.268
Once you switch selection,
there's no going back.

44:27.438 --> 44:31.648
Yes, sir, I know. I was still
hoping for the blue team.

44:31.815 --> 44:35.230
I'm sure Dr. Benton will be very
pleased to have you on his team.

44:35.401 --> 44:37.523
- See you in a few months.
- Thanks.

44:37.694 --> 44:42.070
Hey, Carter, Dr. Benton left
something down here for you.

44:49.410 --> 44:52.777
What do you call the one who graduates
last in his class from medical school?

44:52.953 --> 44:54.744
- What?
- Doctor!

44:54.913 --> 44:58.411
- What are you still doing here?
- Just hanging out.

44:58.582 --> 45:01.914
Well, wanna try out
that new white coat? MVA.
