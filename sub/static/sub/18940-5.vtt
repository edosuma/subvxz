WEBVTT

00:01.452 --> 00:03.330
<i>- Previously on X Company...
- You must be Sabine's father.</i>

00:03.354 --> 00:06.488
Helene Bauer. I'm looking
forward to meeting you.

00:06.524 --> 00:08.624
He's a German agent.
Where is he?

00:08.659 --> 00:12.027
This is me,
asking you the nice way.

00:13.397 --> 00:16.065
We have a promise
to keep to your boss.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.500
So how can we get to Poland?

00:18.536 --> 00:20.869
There's one way to cross
those borders without papers.

00:20.905 --> 00:23.305
Sir, they're
on a train to Poland.

00:23.340 --> 00:25.174
Headed for a concentration camp.

00:25.209 --> 00:26.742
We have to escape.

00:26.777 --> 00:29.645
It's my fault that
they're on that train.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.381
I put that team at risk because I was.
Selfish.

00:32.415 --> 00:34.516
Harry!

00:34.552 --> 00:37.486
<i>Krystina, I rely on you.
I trust your judgment.</i>

00:37.521 --> 00:40.233
The next operational team that goes
out, you're in. I won't let you down.

00:40.257 --> 00:44.326
We're going to take you all
back to our camp. We have to go.

00:44.361 --> 00:46.495
We know this train is carrying
a shipment of weapons

00:46.530 --> 00:49.064
and we'd very much like to take
them with us. Is that your wife?

00:49.100 --> 00:50.999
NO!!

00:51.035 --> 00:52.779
The guns arrived in Pruszko
on yesterday's train.

00:52.803 --> 00:55.838
These are the names of six of
our fighters in German custody.

00:55.873 --> 00:59.007
I will trade Fritz for them.

00:59.043 --> 01:02.377
<i>Unless all six prisoners are there, we'll
execute him. I'm offering you a job.</i>

01:02.413 --> 01:04.413
I'd like you as my associate.

01:04.447 --> 01:07.916
You can start at the office
at 9 am sharp.

01:07.952 --> 01:10.519
We did land a prize.

01:10.554 --> 01:13.322
A Brigadefuhrer.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.194 --> 01:53.328
Pete?

01:59.336 --> 02:02.471
Your instructions were clear.

02:02.506 --> 02:04.773
The man who enters
this room is a mole.

02:04.809 --> 02:06.975
You were to shoot him.
But it was Peter-

02:07.011 --> 02:10.479
- Sometimes your friend is a mole. You
might have to kill someone you know.

02:10.514 --> 02:13.348
I didn't know it was a drill,
okay? Next time...

02:13.384 --> 02:15.651
There's no "next time"
when you're dead.

02:18.189 --> 02:21.757
I'll send my report
to Sergeant Breeland.

02:21.792 --> 02:25.661
Get back to the Camp.

02:25.696 --> 02:27.696
You already did this test?

02:27.731 --> 02:29.698
Yeah.

02:29.733 --> 02:32.100
How'd you do?

02:32.136 --> 02:34.069
I shot Janine.

02:59.997 --> 03:02.364
Good morning, Helene.

03:06.203 --> 03:08.036
Did you get any sleep?

03:08.072 --> 03:10.505
Me neither.

03:10.541 --> 03:14.142
- Has he heard anything?
- Nothing yet.

03:14.178 --> 03:16.879
He's been in Brigadefuhrer
Faber's office

03:16.914 --> 03:19.014
since dawn. But
not much he can do

03:19.049 --> 03:21.984
until Polizeifuhrer
Goestchl gets here.

03:22.019 --> 03:24.319
My boss.

03:24.355 --> 03:26.855
He'll be here soon.
In the meantime...

03:26.891 --> 03:28.991
Ladies,

03:29.026 --> 03:31.660
this is our new associate,
Helene. Marlene,

03:31.695 --> 03:35.364
Lotte... Nice to meet you. So,

03:35.399 --> 03:38.767
Race and Resettlement,
that's us, in this area.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.869
Police are on the other side
of the building,

03:40.905 --> 03:42.871
the Gestapo we are
finding room for.

03:42.907 --> 03:44.873
The Women's League are here too.

03:44.909 --> 03:47.109
We're all piled
on top of each other.

03:47.144 --> 03:49.678
It's a temporary arrangement.

03:49.713 --> 03:51.680
We're just at the beginning now.

03:51.715 --> 03:55.384
- The beginning?
- Poland is the frontier of our Lebensraum.

03:55.419 --> 03:58.287
But soon all of this land
will be reclaimed as our own.

03:58.322 --> 04:00.589
Where do we start?

04:00.624 --> 04:02.791
You will be assigning homes
to the German officers

04:02.826 --> 04:05.427
arriving in Poland.

04:05.462 --> 04:09.197
The homes are empty?
The owners are gone.

04:09.233 --> 04:12.734
I'd like to process
these portfolios today.

04:12.770 --> 04:15.771
- These are important men.
- Everyone in this folder

04:15.806 --> 04:17.906
gets a high-grade property.

04:20.110 --> 04:22.077
That's nothing. You should see

04:22.112 --> 04:24.646
where Obergruppenfuhrer
Schmidt lives.

04:24.682 --> 04:28.450
Everything in the green area
is ready for reassignment.

04:41.699 --> 04:45.300
His parents... his brothers...

04:45.336 --> 04:48.403
they think he's a kid
working at a desk in Ottawa.

04:48.439 --> 04:51.340
They'll get a telegram.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.375
A story.

04:55.312 --> 04:57.279
While some other bastard

04:57.314 --> 05:00.615
gets to keep breathing. You can't blame
him for not rescuing us at Pomoc.

05:00.651 --> 05:02.862
He didn't plan on getting captured.
He had blood on his hands

05:02.886 --> 05:04.953
before we ever got
on that train.

05:04.989 --> 05:07.489
He's our only inside connection
to the oil refineries.

05:07.524 --> 05:09.491
We're lucky he's here.

05:09.526 --> 05:12.227
- Lucky?
- At least this way we can protect him.

05:12.262 --> 05:14.229
Shall I go thank him

05:14.264 --> 05:16.231
for a train ride to Poland,
while we're at it?

05:16.266 --> 05:18.100
Or for shooting Rigaud?

05:18.135 --> 05:21.169
What about the hospitality he showed
you in a Gestapo prison in Paris?

05:21.205 --> 05:23.805
Or have you forgotten about that?
Think of the bigger picture.

05:23.841 --> 05:26.174
We have to get him
back to work in one piece.

05:26.210 --> 05:28.677
If this lot catch us
helping a Nazi, we'll be shot.

05:28.712 --> 05:30.979
This prisoner exchange
needs to happen.

05:32.983 --> 05:35.250
Until then I say
let the Poles have at it.

05:39.823 --> 05:43.525
Where is Polizeifuhrer
Goetschl? I need those prisoners

05:43.560 --> 05:47.129
released immediately. We've been
trying to alert him to the situation,

05:47.164 --> 05:49.364
Herr Obergruppenfuhrer.
He's been investigating

05:49.400 --> 05:52.034
the other incident from last night.
What incident?

05:52.069 --> 05:55.370
The cargo train that was
sabotaged. Set on fire.

05:56.707 --> 05:59.674
- Herr Obergruppenfuhrer.
- Take Fraulein Adler,

05:59.710 --> 06:03.245
find Goetschl, and bring him
here immediately.

06:06.216 --> 06:09.017
Frau Bauer,

06:09.053 --> 06:11.019
excuse my brusque manner.

06:11.055 --> 06:13.422
No apologies necessary,
Herr Obergruppenfuhrer.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.190
I was pleased
when Sabine told me

06:15.225 --> 06:17.392
you were joining us.
I didn't realize...

06:17.428 --> 06:20.662
Fraulein Adler has
offered me a position,

06:20.697 --> 06:22.531
and I was delighted to accept.

06:22.566 --> 06:25.133
Welcome.

06:26.837 --> 06:30.038
- What extraordinary good luck.
- Yes.

06:30.074 --> 06:32.707
I thought so too.

06:40.451 --> 06:43.452
- Where are you going?
- We need to find Aurora.

06:47.591 --> 06:49.558
Gentlemen.

06:49.593 --> 06:51.560
It's been a busy morning.

06:51.595 --> 06:53.962
We haven't been
formally introduced.

06:53.997 --> 06:56.098
Thank you for sheltering us.

06:56.133 --> 06:59.134
They are the Allied agents
who organized the escape,

06:59.169 --> 07:01.136
set fire to the train.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.672
They lost one of their own.

07:03.707 --> 07:05.974
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:06.009 --> 07:08.610
Were you leaving already?
We need to go to Pruszko.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.612
To find the Nazi base
of operations.

07:10.647 --> 07:13.715
- The Town Hall?
- It was ours not so long ago.

07:13.750 --> 07:16.751
- Can you tell us how to get there?
- I would advise against it.

07:16.787 --> 07:19.154
You kicked the hornet's
nest by setting fire

07:19.189 --> 07:21.556
to one of the Germans'
trains yesterday.

07:21.592 --> 07:24.960
If you go, you can't come back. The
Germans are looking for our prisoner.

07:24.995 --> 07:26.795
We know what we're doing.

07:26.830 --> 07:29.998
You'll forgive me if I don't
risk our camp on your good word.

07:32.669 --> 07:35.103
We have a fellow agent

07:35.139 --> 07:37.139
working on infiltrating

07:37.174 --> 07:39.274
the Nazi office. It's
important we make contact.

07:39.309 --> 07:41.821
Our colleague doesn't know if we're
alive and has no way to reach us.

07:41.845 --> 07:45.914
That seems strange considering
you are traveling with a radio.

07:45.949 --> 07:50.118
That's none of your business.

07:50.154 --> 07:54.055
I'll give you
directions to Pruszko.

07:54.091 --> 07:57.058
But I want the use
of your radio.

07:57.094 --> 08:00.762
Zosia needs to relay a message
to our government-in-exile.

08:00.797 --> 08:03.498
I'm the only one
who touches this radio.

08:06.003 --> 08:09.037
Then you are welcome to stay
here and keep it company.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.039
You can go.

08:11.074 --> 08:14.142
But you should know,
our perimeter is patrolled,

08:14.178 --> 08:17.245
our sentries are
camouflaged. Any hint

08:17.281 --> 08:20.382
that you bring the enemy
back with you...

08:22.386 --> 08:24.553
I'll show you the way.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.758
Tell Camp X about yesterday.

08:31.395 --> 08:33.695
And remember
what we talked about.

08:38.936 --> 08:42.736
What took you so long?
You know how important this is.

08:42.773 --> 08:45.073
I'm overstretched.
It's too much for one man.

08:45.108 --> 08:48.076
I can't deal with twelve matters at once.
Then delegate.

08:50.747 --> 08:54.182
- Perhaps we can discuss this in my office?
- We'll discuss it here and now.

08:54.218 --> 08:57.552
I will not allow Faber to be
murdered by these bandits.

08:57.588 --> 08:59.899
Giving them what they want
will only encourage them more.

08:59.923 --> 09:02.857
We wouldn't be in this position if
you had control of your district,

09:02.893 --> 09:05.060
Polizeifuhrer. You want me
to go up in those woods?

09:05.095 --> 09:07.229
Give me a schwadron
and a panzer, at least.

09:07.264 --> 09:10.332
I need more men, more support!
You need Brigadefuhrer Faber!

09:10.367 --> 09:14.102
His skill is worth more than a train
of new men under your supervision.

09:14.137 --> 09:17.739
Not only have you put Germany's race
and resettlement plans at severe risk,

09:17.774 --> 09:19.908
you also put my own
operation in jeopardy.

09:19.943 --> 09:22.244
I can't protect an operation
I know nothing about.

09:22.279 --> 09:24.713
It's a classified project.

09:24.748 --> 09:28.083
I chose Poland because it was
secure. Apparently it's not.

09:28.118 --> 09:30.885
You will bring Faber back

09:30.921 --> 09:34.189
and he will fix your problem.
If you fail to do so,

09:34.224 --> 09:36.958
the Fuhrer will want
to speak to you about it...

09:36.994 --> 09:38.994
Personally.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.270
Talk to Gestapo.
Find the six prisoners!

09:48.305 --> 09:50.472
They will be exchanged
for Brigadefuhrer Faber.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.073
<i>- Jawohl.
- You! Come with me.</i>

09:52.109 --> 09:55.310
We will arrange the convoy. The exchange
is to take place at 1600 hours.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.612
I'll tell my daughter.

10:05.555 --> 10:07.622
What are you working on?

10:07.658 --> 10:09.958
I have to send a message.

10:09.993 --> 10:12.127
May I?

10:14.431 --> 10:16.731
Before our radio was damaged,

10:16.767 --> 10:19.434
I was the operator.

10:19.469 --> 10:21.770
My brother Eli taught me.

10:21.805 --> 10:23.805
He was in the Army.

10:26.009 --> 10:28.777
If you show me the key,
I can work on the encryption.

10:28.812 --> 10:32.113
If it's a one-time code, you're
not giving any secrets away.

10:57.574 --> 11:01.176
I understand.

11:01.211 --> 11:04.679
I'll let him know.

11:14.391 --> 11:17.759
Polizeifuhrer?

11:17.794 --> 11:19.861
All the prisoners
requested by the Resistance

11:19.896 --> 11:21.863
have been deported to the camps.

11:21.898 --> 11:24.510
Then I'll take a truck from the
convoy, and go to the camps myself...

11:24.534 --> 11:26.534
It's not that simple.

11:31.908 --> 11:35.276
We need to talk.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.920
What happened?

11:45.956 --> 11:48.022
They've been executed.

11:48.058 --> 11:52.026
All six of them.

11:52.062 --> 11:55.130
There's no one to exchange
for Brigadefuhrer Faber.

12:05.042 --> 12:07.275
That should do it.

12:09.279 --> 12:13.081
Your brother taught you well.

12:13.116 --> 12:16.584
He's dead.

12:18.855 --> 12:20.989
I'm sorry.

12:21.024 --> 12:23.158
We were hiding

12:23.193 --> 12:25.360
at Janowski's farm.

12:25.395 --> 12:27.562
He and Eli were friends

12:27.597 --> 12:30.331
since they were kids.

12:30.367 --> 12:33.301
A German patrol came one night.

12:33.336 --> 12:36.271
We ran as soon as we heard them,

12:36.306 --> 12:40.141
but one of the soldiers saw us.

12:40.177 --> 12:43.044
Eli was shot in the shoulder.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.580
The... the wound

12:45.615 --> 12:48.116
never healed properly.

12:48.151 --> 12:50.251
He died

12:50.287 --> 12:52.821
of an infection a week later.

12:52.856 --> 12:54.823
And you came here?

12:56.827 --> 12:59.727
We created here.

12:59.763 --> 13:02.764
You think Janowski could go
back home after harbouring Jews?

13:17.280 --> 13:19.547
Bloody hell!

13:21.485 --> 13:24.786
- I keep making mistakes.
- May I?

13:44.541 --> 13:46.975
- Thanks.
- Would you mind

13:47.010 --> 13:49.144
- if I used the radio?
- Go on.

14:01.958 --> 14:04.792
I thought you might be hungry.

14:04.828 --> 14:08.163
- Thank you.
- I'm not hungry.

14:09.900 --> 14:12.534
You haven't eaten all day.

14:14.437 --> 14:16.237
She's tired.

14:16.273 --> 14:18.206
It's been a difficult day.

14:18.241 --> 14:20.208
The situation is in good hands.

14:20.243 --> 14:23.478
The prisoner exchange
will proceed as planned.

14:23.513 --> 14:25.713
That's wonderful.

14:25.749 --> 14:27.715
If you're not going to eat,

14:27.751 --> 14:30.718
you should go home and unpack.
Get some rest.

14:30.754 --> 14:34.255
- I want to stay. I should be here.
- He's strong, Sabine.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.724
He'll find a way to come home.

14:36.760 --> 14:40.795
Maybe you should make sure
everything is ready for him.

14:50.674 --> 14:52.652
Don't you have any friends
out there that could help Franz?

14:52.676 --> 14:54.642
They were supposed
to arrive by train

14:54.678 --> 14:57.912
yesterday, but they didn't.

14:57.948 --> 15:01.015
Of course. You were
everywhere in Paris,

15:01.051 --> 15:03.751
but now, when we need you?
Nowhere to be found.

15:03.787 --> 15:05.753
Untersturmfuhrer Edsel

15:05.789 --> 15:08.623
has arranged for someone
to take you home, Sabine.

15:16.900 --> 15:19.801
Thank you, Frau Bauer.

15:19.836 --> 15:23.238
It means a great deal to me
that you are here.

15:25.408 --> 15:27.408
For Sabine.

15:27.444 --> 15:29.611
A friend like you.

15:29.646 --> 15:31.879
At a time like this.

15:31.915 --> 15:34.449
It means a lot to me too.

15:34.484 --> 15:38.253
To be here for both of you.

15:43.026 --> 15:45.827
He's for Janowski.

15:45.862 --> 15:48.663
They're going to have
a talk. Alone.

15:48.698 --> 15:50.765
A friend of mine died yesterday.

15:53.169 --> 15:55.003
He was locked in a transport
to a death camp.

16:05.715 --> 16:08.583
He died trying to save
innocent people from that train.

16:08.618 --> 16:10.585
Mowed down by Nazi gunfire.

16:10.620 --> 16:12.620
I'm sorry for your loss.

16:14.624 --> 16:16.591
But I didn't kill him.
It wasn't my fault.

16:16.626 --> 16:19.294
It wasn't your fault?!

16:19.329 --> 16:22.630
Wasn't your fault?!

16:31.074 --> 16:34.575
The Nazis raided my village

16:34.611 --> 16:38.012
when I was in a POW camp.

16:38.048 --> 16:40.048
They took my wife.

16:41.818 --> 16:44.485
Without shame,

16:44.521 --> 16:48.089
in front of my whole family.

16:48.124 --> 16:51.559
My mother was too ill to even get
up, so they shot her in her bed.

16:56.499 --> 16:59.000
That wasn't my fault, either!

17:07.210 --> 17:09.544
Clearly he's smart, motivated.

17:09.579 --> 17:11.646
He's also impulsive
and lacks discipline.

17:11.681 --> 17:14.449
He failed the mole test, but performed
well in the bartender sting.

17:14.483 --> 17:16.517
- He can play a role.
- So what do you think?

17:16.553 --> 17:19.252
He needs more time.
Janine, Peter, and Imre

17:19.289 --> 17:21.823
are all progressing well. And
how about Sergeant Breeland?

17:21.858 --> 17:25.026
- I told my parents my boss might send me out of town for...
- Sir.

17:25.060 --> 17:28.128
What is it?

17:35.171 --> 17:37.405
We lost Harry.

17:56.626 --> 17:59.427
I can't seem to find something
adequate for Reichmann and Dahl.

17:59.462 --> 18:01.562
There are only cottages left.

18:01.598 --> 18:04.744
I'm sure something appropriate will come
up after the next block of evacuations.

18:04.768 --> 18:07.034
- More Jews.
- No, no.

18:07.070 --> 18:10.605
Most of them are already gone.
The locals are being resettled.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.440
Resettled?

18:12.475 --> 18:15.510
There will be ample choices for Dahl
and Reichmann when they arrive.

18:23.586 --> 18:25.353
Jana?

18:29.259 --> 18:31.826
Take this to the mail room.

18:33.263 --> 18:35.296
Please don't be put off.

18:35.331 --> 18:39.133
We keep some of them around
because they have some education.

18:39.169 --> 18:43.004
We're very understaffed. Not just
us, either. The post office,

18:43.039 --> 18:45.606
library, train station...
Fraulein Adler!

18:47.377 --> 18:50.144
I'll be right back.

18:58.221 --> 19:01.923
I'm going to step out
for a moment.

19:01.958 --> 19:04.859
Good day.

19:43.233 --> 19:46.033
I... I heard about the fire.

19:46.069 --> 19:49.103
- What happened?
- It was us.

19:49.138 --> 19:52.240
To get them to stop the train.

19:52.275 --> 19:55.209
We managed to break out, but...

19:55.245 --> 19:58.312
we were under fire
from the Germans.

19:58.348 --> 20:00.748
And Harry...

21:06.249 --> 21:10.251
The Gestapo's going to show up
for the rendezvous at 4:00 PM.

21:10.286 --> 21:13.821
- Without the prisoners?
- I couldn't get any more details.

21:13.856 --> 21:16.924
My guess is that they'll try
to free Faber by force.

21:16.960 --> 21:20.528
- And when...
- Morning.

21:20.563 --> 21:23.230
When the Resistance sees
that they've been lied to,

21:23.266 --> 21:26.167
they'll try to kill him.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.502
I'll do what I can
to keep him out of harm's way.

21:28.538 --> 21:32.073
Alfred, the mission can't
lose both you and Faber.

21:32.108 --> 21:34.075
Heidi says that the whole town

21:34.110 --> 21:36.110
is understaffed.
The Reich is desperate for...

21:36.145 --> 21:38.379
Good morning.

21:38.414 --> 21:41.248
Educated people
with some German.

21:41.284 --> 21:43.884
The train station?

21:43.920 --> 21:46.354
I might be able
to track oil shipments.

21:46.389 --> 21:48.723
The Germans won't
make it that easy.

21:48.758 --> 21:52.326
No. But it might get us
closer to the refineries.

21:52.362 --> 21:55.429
You're going to need
some Polish papers.

21:55.465 --> 21:58.866
I'll see what I can find
at the office.

21:58.901 --> 22:02.303
I'll meet you back here later.
Yeah.

22:02.338 --> 22:04.472
I've been gone too long.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.991
We never got to finish our
conversation from the train.

22:24.027 --> 22:26.305
If you're going to ask about
the guns, I've already told...

22:26.329 --> 22:29.330
I'm more interested in
what brings you here, Fritz.

22:29.365 --> 22:32.333
Someone of your rank,
it must be business.

22:32.368 --> 22:34.568
So what is it? More evacuations?

22:34.604 --> 22:38.239
I deal in counterintelligence.
Pacification.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.875
I can see why my superiors
required my presence here.

22:40.910 --> 22:44.145
Your camp is impressive.
It's well hidden.

22:44.180 --> 22:47.048
And very well fortified.

22:47.083 --> 22:49.016
Even if you were
to get out of here alive,

22:49.052 --> 22:51.018
you'll never find it again.

22:51.054 --> 22:53.888
If you stay away from German villages
and trains, I won't have to.

22:53.923 --> 22:56.424
Cross your heart
and hope to die?

22:56.459 --> 22:58.693
A gentleman's agreement.

22:58.728 --> 23:02.663
If you let me go and stop
illegal actions in this area,

23:02.699 --> 23:05.933
I won't send anyone to harm you.

23:05.968 --> 23:09.036
Call it a cease fire.

23:09.072 --> 23:11.872
These are not German villages.

23:11.908 --> 23:14.742
You are on Polish soil.

23:14.777 --> 23:17.078
On our land.

23:17.113 --> 23:20.181
We're both soldiers.
This is war.

23:20.216 --> 23:22.950
It's not a personal choice. No.

23:22.985 --> 23:25.686
You could have been
a better man.

23:25.722 --> 23:28.522
But you put on a uniform,
and let it make choices for you.

23:28.558 --> 23:32.059
When the war is over,

23:32.095 --> 23:36.263
win or lose, you'll find a way

23:36.299 --> 23:39.400
to justify your actions:

23:39.435 --> 23:42.036
"I am a soldier."

23:42.071 --> 23:44.138
"It was my duty."

23:47.944 --> 23:50.177
"It wasn't personal."

23:53.149 --> 23:56.717
But we both know
that isn't true.

23:58.955 --> 24:02.156
I want to make sure
that you never,

24:02.191 --> 24:06.160
ever forget the choice you made.

24:08.164 --> 24:11.866
To put on that uniform
and play your part.

24:20.843 --> 24:24.378
Either way, Fritz,
things are going to be

24:24.413 --> 24:27.481
different when you look
in the mirror now.

24:46.536 --> 24:49.303
Did you find your friend?

24:49.338 --> 24:53.374
Yes. The prisoner exchange
will happen as planned.

24:53.409 --> 24:56.277
- Good.
- But we need to be prepared.

24:56.312 --> 24:58.546
Don't worry,
we'll have full control,

24:58.581 --> 25:03.050
clear visibility and snipers
concealed in the trees.

25:03.085 --> 25:06.353
We'll be ready.

25:06.389 --> 25:08.889
<i>Let's get back to the guns.</i>

25:08.925 --> 25:10.925
Where are they?

25:13.229 --> 25:15.629
Where are they?

25:26.943 --> 25:29.643
Please just stop.

25:33.549 --> 25:35.549
The man needs to be presentable.

25:38.321 --> 25:41.055
He needs to be able to walk.

25:44.160 --> 25:46.894
I know what she looks like.

25:46.929 --> 25:50.531
That's right. Your wife.

25:50.566 --> 25:53.100
I don't think it would be
very hard to find out

25:53.135 --> 25:55.836
where she lives,

25:55.872 --> 26:00.174
where she sleeps.

26:02.178 --> 26:05.713
Tell me where the guns are.

26:05.748 --> 26:07.982
Or I will find her

26:08.017 --> 26:11.919
and do to her what
your people did to mine.

26:11.954 --> 26:16.257
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

27:14.550 --> 27:16.550
Here.

27:21.157 --> 27:23.557
They don't have the prisoners
to trade for you.

27:23.592 --> 27:27.061
They've been killed.
No one here knows.

27:27.096 --> 27:30.064
They think the Germans are going
ahead with the exchange.

27:30.099 --> 27:32.366
We'll find a way
to set you free.

27:51.020 --> 27:53.432
Could you watch them a moment
while I load these welcome gifts

27:53.456 --> 27:55.255
- into the car?
- Of course.

27:55.291 --> 27:58.892
Come along, ladies.

28:32.228 --> 28:34.595
Could you take these
into the mail room?

28:34.630 --> 28:37.264
All three of you.

28:37.299 --> 28:39.600
Immediately.

29:22.445 --> 29:25.946
It's the personal touches,
when you arrive in a new place.

29:25.981 --> 29:28.282
They make all the difference.

29:49.705 --> 29:52.573
You'll need this at the exchange.
He has to escape alive.

29:54.910 --> 29:56.877
Everyone we've lost. Everything.

29:56.912 --> 29:59.024
It'll be for nothing if our
operation is compromised now.

29:59.048 --> 30:01.315
Rigaud, Harry.

30:01.350 --> 30:04.151
They have one thing
in common. Franz Faber.

30:04.186 --> 30:06.453
You think that's a coincidence?

30:06.489 --> 30:08.455
We need him freed.

30:08.491 --> 30:11.492
Her direct orders.

30:28.377 --> 30:30.744
Ten more minutes,

30:30.779 --> 30:32.779
then we kill him.

30:37.953 --> 30:39.887
Take your positions.

31:00.576 --> 31:03.443
How were you going
to get us off the train?

31:03.479 --> 31:05.512
You were wanted fugitives.

31:05.548 --> 31:07.514
Political dissidents

31:07.550 --> 31:09.583
I urgently needed to question.

31:09.618 --> 31:11.885
You think I came to you to put
more blood on my hands?

31:25.768 --> 31:29.303
This doesn't mean we're square.

31:31.273 --> 31:33.273
Release the prisoner!

31:33.309 --> 31:36.610
The prisoner stays where he is
until I see our men.

31:38.647 --> 31:41.949
Out!

31:47.690 --> 31:50.490
Move! Come!

31:55.531 --> 31:58.165
Remove the hoods!

31:59.702 --> 32:03.604
I said, take them off!

32:09.878 --> 32:12.946
This isn't right.

33:16.078 --> 33:18.045
What happened?

33:18.080 --> 33:21.515
Where are the prisoners?
Probably dead already.

33:21.550 --> 33:25.252
I thought your source
said they had them,

33:25.287 --> 33:28.488
that we'd get them back.
That's what we were told.

33:28.524 --> 33:30.557
Zosia, they're not to be blamed.

33:30.592 --> 33:32.926
We were prepared for the ambush.

33:32.961 --> 33:36.229
We'd have lost more, if we
hadn't had eyes in the trees.

33:36.265 --> 33:38.231
Where is the German?

33:38.267 --> 33:40.233
We lost him.

33:40.269 --> 33:42.536
Stroik is looking
for him in the woods.

33:48.110 --> 33:51.845
Jiri, Antonin, Teodor.

33:51.880 --> 33:54.281
They're gone.

34:00.356 --> 34:03.590
- Now what?
- We're low on guns.

34:05.594 --> 34:07.928
We might have more.

34:07.963 --> 34:09.929
I got through to London,

34:09.965 --> 34:12.065
thanks to their radio.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.646
<i>Franz!</i>

34:28.650 --> 34:31.217
- Don't.
- What happened to you?

34:31.253 --> 34:33.920
- I need a clean shirt.
- Why? - Where are they?

34:33.956 --> 34:37.491
Where did you put them?

34:39.962 --> 34:43.263
Where are they?

34:43.297 --> 34:45.297
I need a shirt!

34:46.467 --> 34:48.101
Here.

34:48.137 --> 34:51.138
I'll bring you a fresh uniform.

34:51.172 --> 34:53.306
The bathroom is through there.

35:14.963 --> 35:17.464
- You know where the station is?
- Yeah.

35:23.439 --> 35:25.605
The operator came through.

35:25.641 --> 35:27.974
They're going to drop in
more guns and explosives.

35:31.480 --> 35:33.647
- Glad it could help.
- Then we'll have two guns

35:33.682 --> 35:35.949
for every man. What do you mean?

35:35.984 --> 35:38.952
Stroik got Fritz to tell him
where the weapons are. The ones

35:38.987 --> 35:42.322
from the train. He and Jerzy went to.
Why didn't you tell me this?

35:42.357 --> 35:45.792
- I thought you knew.
- Which way did they go? - The edge of Pruszko,

35:45.828 --> 35:48.862
the old warehouse.

35:55.204 --> 35:58.805
- Franz!
- Herr Brigadefuhrer! You're injured.

35:58.841 --> 36:02.709
- Is this my office?
- Yes.

36:07.349 --> 36:10.217
- I need you to get a team together.
- Yes, Herr Bridgadefuhrer.

36:10.252 --> 36:12.897
- We're going to eradicate those Resistance guerrillas.
- Where do we start?

36:12.921 --> 36:15.322
The forest spans for miles.
No, not the forest.

36:15.357 --> 36:18.024
I know exactly where
they will be. I sent them there.

36:21.163 --> 36:24.364
There are to be no survivors.
Understood, Herr Brigadefuhrer.

36:24.399 --> 36:26.933
Now, Edsel!

36:26.969 --> 36:30.203
I hope you will
consider the position.

36:30.239 --> 36:33.840
It has been so difficult to find
a literate German speaker.

36:33.876 --> 36:36.643
But these are
the things we must do.

36:36.678 --> 36:39.279
My mother insisted
I learn as a child.

36:39.314 --> 36:41.848
It was either that
or the violin.

36:41.884 --> 36:45.118
Personally speaking, I would
prefer to see more violinists

36:45.153 --> 36:48.288
among us than German speakers.
Alec, this is my daughter,

36:48.323 --> 36:50.290
Irena.

36:50.325 --> 36:52.559
Without her, this place
would be in shambles.

36:52.594 --> 36:55.795
- Pleased to meet you.
- Show Alec around, will you?

36:55.831 --> 36:57.731
When can you start?

36:57.766 --> 36:59.799
Now?

36:59.835 --> 37:01.801
Perfect.

37:01.837 --> 37:04.271
So, Alec.

37:04.306 --> 37:08.241
We handle passenger tickets, but
most of our work involves cargo.

37:08.277 --> 37:11.378
Don't move!

37:11.413 --> 37:13.947
Take their weapons!
They're already here.

37:13.982 --> 37:16.583
Let's get closer.

37:16.618 --> 37:19.119
Up against the wall!

37:19.154 --> 37:21.688
Move! Move!

37:24.026 --> 37:26.660
Follow me. Stay low.

37:34.036 --> 37:37.704
No. Wait.

37:41.944 --> 37:43.610
There's too many of them.

37:45.614 --> 37:49.549
We'll get the bastards
and we'll make them pay.

38:03.298 --> 38:05.365
For the exchange.
We were supposed

38:05.400 --> 38:08.001
to ambush the bandits,
not the other way around.

38:08.036 --> 38:10.604
Instead, not a single soldier
comes back alive.

38:10.639 --> 38:13.707
Now you see what I've been dealing
with here. They're savages.

38:13.742 --> 38:16.710
Stop making excuses.

38:16.745 --> 38:19.679
What are their numbers? It wasn't
numbers that made the difference.

38:19.715 --> 38:22.026
They set the terms for the rendezvous.
They had time to plan.

38:22.050 --> 38:26.119
It happened on their territory.
It's a miracle I made it out.

38:26.154 --> 38:28.755
Where is their camp?
How well defended?

38:32.327 --> 38:34.561
I saw nothing. I was
blindfolded the whole time.

38:34.596 --> 38:36.696
They led me in circles
to the meeting point,

38:36.732 --> 38:40.333
so I can't locate the camp.
They're motivated.

38:40.369 --> 38:44.070
Ruthless. But they're
desperate for weapons.

38:44.106 --> 38:47.007
Yes.

38:49.011 --> 38:52.312
- Herr Brigadefuhrer, a word?
- Please excuse us.

38:52.347 --> 38:56.182
Untersturmfuhrer Edsel
can speak freely.

38:58.186 --> 39:01.721
All the Resistance guerrillas at
the target location were shot.

39:01.757 --> 39:04.157
I also took the liberty
of keeping one of them alive

39:04.192 --> 39:06.760
for interrogation. I believe
he was their leader.

39:06.795 --> 39:08.828
I extracted

39:08.864 --> 39:11.765
some very valuable
intelligence from him.

39:11.800 --> 39:14.401
There are Allied spies
among the Polish Resistance.

39:14.436 --> 39:16.503
Two men in the forest.

39:16.538 --> 39:19.572
And someone working among us.

39:19.608 --> 39:23.309
Thank you, Edsel.

39:26.348 --> 39:28.448
I need to speak to the
Brigadefuhrer alone.

39:34.990 --> 39:38.858
This is now your top priority.
You need to capture those spies.

39:38.894 --> 39:42.328
- I'll dispose of them.
- No. I want them questioned.

39:42.364 --> 39:45.331
I need to know if they're here
to support Resistance

39:45.367 --> 39:47.767
or if they're targeting
Marigold.

39:47.803 --> 39:51.471
- Marigold?
- Find the spies and we'll discuss it.

40:03.819 --> 40:06.219
I know you requested
they all be killed.

40:06.254 --> 40:08.621
But the man who
struck Frau Faber

40:08.657 --> 40:10.990
is still alive.
He's downstairs in a cell.

40:11.026 --> 40:14.627
I thought maybe you'd want
to speak with him...

40:14.663 --> 40:16.663
personally?

40:24.005 --> 40:27.874
Good work, Matthias.

40:32.414 --> 40:34.814
Release him.

40:38.453 --> 40:41.121
Out.

40:44.926 --> 40:46.926
Get up.

40:51.366 --> 40:54.400
Empty your pockets
onto the table.

41:06.481 --> 41:09.048
Sit down.

41:24.466 --> 41:28.234
If you think you're going to find out the
location of our camp, you are sadly mis...

41:34.743 --> 41:38.411
The rendezvous is set.
Your contacts are expecting you.

41:38.446 --> 41:42.115
- We'll do you proud, sir.
- Flight leaves at 0300. Gentlemen.

41:42.150 --> 41:45.318
Sir.

41:45.353 --> 41:48.288
Flight? You're sending them
into the field?

41:48.323 --> 41:51.257
We need replacement agents
for Harry and Tom.

41:51.293 --> 41:53.259
Peter and David?

41:53.295 --> 41:55.261
- That's right.
- Sir, you said that I could...

41:55.297 --> 41:57.330
I've made my decision, Krystina.

41:57.365 --> 42:00.834
David just failed
his field test.

42:00.869 --> 42:02.969
There'll be other opportunities.

42:03.004 --> 42:07.173
I am a fully qualified radio
operator and fluent in Polish.

42:07.209 --> 42:10.210
Prepare their papers, please.

42:24.826 --> 42:28.328
We have a mole.
