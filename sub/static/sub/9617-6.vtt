WEBVTT

00:05.239 --> 00:08.474
ALL RIGHT, WEIRDOS.
LISTEN UP AND
LISTEN UP GOOD.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.342
I GOT LIKE A MINUTE
BEFORE HE WALKS
THROUGH THE DOOR.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.910
WHO'S COMING THROUGH
THE DOOR, MAYA?

00:11.912 --> 00:13.345
YOUR UNCLE BOING.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.214
OH, MAYA,
YOU'VE GOT TO
GET OFF OF THIS.

00:15.216 --> 00:16.915
NOPE. THE REASON
HE'S NOT INTERESTED

00:16.917 --> 00:18.350
IS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
PLAYING IT ALL WRONG.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.586
SEE, MY STRATEGY OF TURNING
INTO A TOTAL NUT JOB

00:20.588 --> 00:21.620
AT THE MERE
SIGHT OF HIM

00:21.622 --> 00:22.788
AIN'T WORKING OUT
AS PLANNED.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.656
MAYA, IT'S NOTHING
YOU'RE DOING.

00:24.658 --> 00:25.724
IT'S THE AGE DIFFERENCE.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.176
THREE YEARS OLDER.

00:27.177 --> 00:28.627
YOUR DAD MARRIED YOUR MOM.
HE'S LIKE 20 YEARS OLDER.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.298
WE'RE EXACTLY
THE SAME AGE.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.400
WHAT?

00:38.339 --> 00:39.872
I JUST NEED TO
BE CASZH.

00:39.874 --> 00:41.540
HOW'S THIS?

00:41.542 --> 00:43.342
(chuckles)

00:43.344 --> 00:44.476
YEAH,
HOW'S THIS?

00:46.914 --> 00:49.481
-HEY, FAMILY.
-YEAH, HI. I DON'T CARE.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.383
MY BROTHER.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.068
MY BROTHER.

00:53.069 --> 00:54.752
SO, RILEY, SHOULDN'T WE
BE HEADING TO SCHOOL NOW,

00:54.755 --> 00:57.289
SINCE THERE'S NOTHING
HERE FOR ME OF ANY INTEREST?

00:57.291 --> 00:58.390
SURE.
LET'S GO.

00:59.326 --> 01:01.393
THINK SHE'LL
MAKE IT OUT THE DOOR?

01:01.395 --> 01:02.661
I GIVE HER 10 SECONDS

01:02.663 --> 01:04.463
BEFORE SHE
JUMPS ON HIS HEAD.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.768
I CAME UP HERE BECAUSE
I WANTED TO DO THIS
IN FRONT OF ALL OF YOU.

01:09.770 --> 01:12.905
I HOLD IN MY HAND
AN ENVELOPE FROM
NEW YORK UNIVERSITY.

01:12.907 --> 01:15.874
OHH.
ARE WE STOPPING?

01:15.876 --> 01:17.709
I'M NOT STOPPING.
I'M RESTING.

01:19.847 --> 01:22.648
WHAT'S IN THIS ENVELOPE TELLS ME
WHERE I'M GONNA BE
FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.

01:23.651 --> 01:26.585
OHH.
ARE WE STOPPING?

01:26.587 --> 01:28.287
I'M NOT AS YOUNG
AS I USED TO BE.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.256
GOOD LUCK,
JOSH.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.391
YEAH, HI.
I DON'T CARE.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.595
IS IT JUST ME
OR IS THERE A NEW

01:36.597 --> 01:39.765
MATURITY IN MAYA
THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE?

01:39.767 --> 01:41.733
I FIND IT INTRIGUING.

01:42.937 --> 01:44.636
(screaming)
WHERE WILL YOU BE?

01:48.342 --> 01:50.576
HOLD ON TO
YOUR DIGNITY, WOMAN!

01:51.812 --> 01:53.545
TOO LATE FOR THAT.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.017
GET OFF ME,
YOU LITTLE FERRET!

01:59.019 --> 02:00.519
GIVE IT!

02:00.520 --> 02:02.020
-IT'S MY LIFE!
-IT AFFECTS ME, TOO!

02:03.591 --> 02:06.024
-"DEAR APPLICANT BOING."
-IT DOESN'T SAY THAT.

02:06.026 --> 02:08.460
"THIS YEAR WE ARE
ONLY ACCEPTING
MARRIED APPLICANTS."

02:08.462 --> 02:10.329
IT DOESN'T
SAY THAT!

02:10.331 --> 02:11.530
"SO...

02:11.532 --> 02:13.532
WE REGRET TO
INFORM YOU THAT..."

02:13.534 --> 02:15.067
REGRET TO
INFORM ME?

02:15.069 --> 02:17.436
"WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU
THAT YOU WILL BE SPENDING

02:17.438 --> 02:19.638
THE NEXT FOUR YEARS
IN NEW YORK WITH MAYA!"

02:19.640 --> 02:21.306
I GOT IN?
I GOT IN!

02:21.308 --> 02:22.975
WE GOT IN.
CONGRATULATIONS.

02:22.977 --> 02:25.377
-All: YAY!
-THAT'S SO GREAT.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.412
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.016
CONGRATULATIONS,
BUDDY.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.351
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.485
IT MEANS A LOT,
CORY.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.720
ALL VERY EXCITING,
I'M SURE.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.455
BUT RILEY AND I

02:36.457 --> 02:37.856
HAVE OUR OWN
EDUCATIONS TO WHICH

02:37.858 --> 02:39.625
TO ATTEND...
TO WHICH.

02:40.928 --> 02:41.994
THIS IS SO GREAT.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.879
AND MY BUDDY
WHO GOES THERE

02:43.880 --> 02:45.763
INVITED ME TO HIS DORM TONIGHT
TO MEET SOME COLLEGE FRIENDS
IF I GOT IN.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.367
OHH.
ARE WE STOPPING?

02:48.369 --> 02:50.435
NOPE. WE'RE DOING
SOMETHING ELSE NOW.

02:53.107 --> 02:55.641
WHEN IS THIS LITTLE PARTY?
YEAH, WHATEVER, HI,
I DON'T CARE.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.611
UH, 10:00 TONIGHT?

02:58.612 --> 03:00.646
WHERE'S THIS LITTLE PARTY?
YEAH, WHATEVER, HI,
I DON'T CARE.

03:00.648 --> 03:01.713
GREENWICH HALL.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.816
ARE WE SMILING?

03:04.818 --> 03:07.119
I'LL SMILE.
I'LL SMILE ANYTIME.

03:07.121 --> 03:08.387
WHAT ARE WE
SMILING ABOUT?

03:08.389 --> 03:10.722
BAY WINDOW.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.391
BAY WINDOW
RIGHT NOW.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.461
CAN I SLEEP OVER
AT YOUR HOUSE TONIGHT?

03:16.463 --> 03:18.063
-YAY.
-BUT NOT REALLY?

03:18.065 --> 03:19.398
AWW.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.033
I'M GOING TO
THAT PARTY.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.669
OOH, YOU'RE GOING
TO SNEAK OUT?

03:23.671 --> 03:26.438
BUT HE SAID IT COULD
GO TILL 10:00.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.973
NO,
IT STARTS AT 10:00.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.509
IT STARTS AT 10:00?

03:31.512 --> 03:33.445
WHO EVEN HEARD OF
SUCH A THING?

03:33.447 --> 03:35.080
THAT BOTHERS YOU, HUH?

03:35.082 --> 03:36.848
IT STARTS AT 10:00?

03:39.453 --> 03:41.019
THERE ARE GOING TO BE
COLLEGE GIRLS THERE.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.754
AND THEY'RE PRETTY,
AND THEY'RE SMART,

03:42.756 --> 03:44.022
AND THEY'RE
WITCHES.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.557
I DON'T LIKE
WITCHES.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.794
WE CAN'T LET JOSH
FALL UNDER THEIR SPELL, RILEY.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.896
I'M SNEAKING OUT.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.997
YOU WILL BE GROUNDED FOREVER,
AND I WILL LOSE MY BEST FRIEND.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.767
-DON'T DO THIS.
-NO.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.535
I'M NOT GONNA LOOK BACK
AND REGRET THE THINGS
I DIDN'T DO.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.437
I WANT TO LOOK BACK
AND REGRET THE THINGS

03:58.439 --> 03:59.571
I DID DO.

04:01.175 --> 04:02.658
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.142
YOUR CONSCIENCE WILL
ALWAYS BOTHER YOU.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.410
I DON'T HAVE
A CONSCIENCE.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.511
EVERYBODY DOES.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.581
AND UNTIL
YOURS SHOWS UP,

04:10.517 --> 04:11.516
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

04:11.518 --> 04:13.719
OH, REALLY?

04:13.720 --> 04:15.921
YOU READY TO SNEAK OUT
THIS WINDOW AND CRASH
A 10:00 COLLEGE PARTY WITH ME?

04:15.923 --> 04:17.556
I AM SO READY.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.659
IT STARTS AT 10:00?

OKAY, HOW ARE WE
PULLING THIS CAPER OFF?

05:19.553 --> 05:22.087
RILEY, IF WE SNUCK OUT
FOR AN ADVENTURE, I KNOW
YOU'D TELL YOUR PARENTS.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.588
I PROMISE
I WON'T.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.524
-WHO'S TALKING?
-WE ARE. IT'S US.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.626
YOU AIN'T GOING.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.027
WHAT IS A LIE?

05:29.029 --> 05:30.662
WHAT ARE THE
EFFECTS OF A LIE

05:30.664 --> 05:31.797
ON THE HUMAN SOUL?

05:33.033 --> 05:34.633
WHY ARE YOU
LOOKING AT ME?

05:36.270 --> 05:38.603
THE MAN WHO SUMMED UP
THE PRICE OF A LIE

05:38.605 --> 05:40.639
WAS EDGAR ALLAN POE

05:40.641 --> 05:42.607
IN  <i> THE TELL-TALE HEART.</i>

05:42.609 --> 05:43.742
FARKLE.

05:43.744 --> 05:44.876
SO...

05:44.878 --> 05:46.678
THIS GUY
CHOPS SOMEBODY UP,

05:46.680 --> 05:48.280
HIDES HIM IN THE FLOOR.

05:48.282 --> 05:49.581
HE'S COOL
FOR AWHILE,

05:49.583 --> 05:50.949
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN,

05:50.951 --> 05:51.983
BOOM, BOOM.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.685
BOOM, BOOM.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.853
BOOM, BOOM!

05:56.623 --> 05:57.889
HIS GUILTY CONSCIENCE
MADE HIM HEAR

05:57.891 --> 05:59.591
THE HEARTBEAT
UNDER THE FLOORBOARDS.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.176
SO,
HE GAVE HIMSELF UP.

06:01.177 --> 06:02.760
SOME PEOPLE JUST AIN'T
CUT OUT FOR THIS STUFF.

06:04.098 --> 06:05.263
HE CALLED ON ME,
YOU KNOW.

06:05.265 --> 06:06.631
I KNOW STUFF.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.200
I KNOW
A LOT OF STUFF.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.168
I KNOW STUFF
ABOUT YOU.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.603
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME.

06:11.605 --> 06:12.905
BOOM, BOOM.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.206
-WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
-BOOM, BOOM.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.908
-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
-BOOM, BOOM!

06:15.909 --> 06:17.609
ALL THROUGH KINDERGARTEN,
I NEVER FELL ASLEEP ONCE.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.177
I WAS FAKING ALL MY NAPS.
FAKING THEM. I CAN'T DO IT.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.946
I DON'T KNOW HOW MAYA CAN JUST
FALL ASLEEP ANYWHERE.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.285
(snoring)

06:33.560 --> 06:36.995
OKAY, SO, GUYS,
THE POINT OF THE STORY
IS THAT THE CONSCIENCE

06:36.997 --> 06:38.897
IS MORE POWERFUL
THAN WE REALIZE.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.133
I NEVER
WAKE YOU UP.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.205
FOR THOSE OF US
WHO HAVE ONE.

06:48.642 --> 06:49.708
NOW,

06:49.710 --> 06:51.276
JUST AS THE TRUTH
COMES OUT,

06:51.278 --> 06:52.878
SO TOO
WILL A LIE.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.014
HOW WILL YOU
LIVE YOUR LIVES?

06:56.950 --> 06:59.651
HOW STRONG
IS YOUR CONSCIENCE?

06:59.653 --> 07:01.686
(heart beating)

07:05.659 --> 07:06.925
WE HAVEN'T
DONE ANYTHING YET.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.060
OH, YEAH.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.098
<i>(lighthearted music playing)</i>

07:22.676 --> 07:24.109
BEFORE YOU GIVE UP
ON ME COMPLETELY,

07:24.111 --> 07:26.077
YOU'VE GOTTA GIVE ME
A TRIAL RUN AT LEAST.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.813
YOU GOTTA, MAYA.
YOU'VE JUST GOTTA.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.881
(groans)

07:29.883 --> 07:31.883
YAY.
IF I SUCCEED...

07:31.885 --> 07:33.618
I TAKE YOU.
AND IF YOU FAIL...

07:33.620 --> 07:34.953
I'M OUT,
AND OUT LIKE A LIGHT.

07:35.889 --> 07:36.955
OKAY.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.291
WHAT'S HE DOING?

07:40.928 --> 07:42.627
HE LOVES
HIS TOTS.

07:42.629 --> 07:43.762
Cory:
EIGHT.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.063
NINE.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.731
10?

07:46.733 --> 07:48.767
10 TOTS.

07:48.769 --> 07:49.835
AUGGIE,

07:49.837 --> 07:50.902
HOW MANY YOU GOT?

07:50.904 --> 07:52.304
12.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.638
GIMME.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.007
DO I HAVE TO?

07:56.009 --> 07:57.342
HE COUNTS THE TOTS

07:57.344 --> 07:58.877
ON EVERYBODY'S PLATE

07:58.878 --> 08:00.411
TO MAKE SURE THAT
NOBODY GETS MORE
THAN HIM.

08:00.414 --> 08:01.913
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I DO.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.717
I KNOW ONE THING
FOR SURE ABOUT LIFE.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.419
10 TOTS IS
ONE TOT TOO LITTLE,

08:07.421 --> 08:10.355
AND 12 TOTS IS
ONE TOT TOO MUCH.

08:10.357 --> 08:12.190
WATCH THIS,
RILEY.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.893
MR. MATTHEWS,
YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD.
YOU WEARING YOUR HAIR DIFFERENT?

08:14.895 --> 08:16.761
HOW WOULD THAT
EVEN BE POSSIBLE?

08:16.763 --> 08:18.663
THANK YOU, MAYA.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.065
A LOT OF WORK.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.067
THIS DOESN'T
JUST HAPPEN.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.802
(chuckles)

08:23.804 --> 08:25.971
(heart beating)

08:29.710 --> 08:31.810
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH RILEY?

08:31.812 --> 08:33.912
I DON'T KNOW, AUGGIE.
RILEY, IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG?

08:35.082 --> 08:37.449
YEAH-HUH.

08:37.451 --> 08:38.817
BOOM, BOOM.

08:41.788 --> 08:42.921
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:42.923 --> 08:44.422
I'M NOT REALLY HUNGRY.

08:44.424 --> 08:45.824
-DOES ANYBODY ELSE WANT THIS?
-NO, RILEY.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.860
IT'S YOURS.
EAT IT.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.762
(growling)
EAT IT.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.466
WHAT HAPPENS
IF I EAT YOU?

08:54.468 --> 08:57.002
OH, I BECOME
PART OF YOUR SOUL

08:57.004 --> 08:58.770
AND HAUNT YOU
FOREVER.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.171
(echoes)

09:00.173 --> 09:02.541
ENJOY ME,
AND TELL ME
I'M DELICIOUS.

09:02.543 --> 09:05.110
RILEY, ARE YOU
GOING TO EAT THIS?

09:05.112 --> 09:06.778
OR ARE YOU
NOT GOING?

09:06.780 --> 09:07.846
I'M GOING.

09:09.917 --> 09:10.982
(gags)

09:13.253 --> 09:14.319
SWALLOW IT.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.855
Conscience:
<i>HERE I GO.</i>

09:16.857 --> 09:18.323
<i>WHEE.</i>

09:24.331 --> 09:25.897
SO I'M IN,
RIGHT?

09:25.899 --> 09:26.831
YES.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.800
SQUEE!

09:28.802 --> 09:31.002
ALL RIGHT. FIRST THING
WE'RE GONNA NEED
IS ANOTHER RILEY.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.271
-WHY?
-YOUR PARENTS ARE
GOING TO OPEN THE DOOR

09:33.273 --> 09:35.473
TO CHECK ON YOU,
AND IT NEEDS TO LOOK
LIKE YOU'RE IN HERE.

09:35.475 --> 09:36.775
MAYA,

09:36.777 --> 09:38.743
HOW COULD IT
POSSIBLY HAPPEN

09:38.745 --> 09:40.312
WHERE ANYONE WOULD
EVER BELIEVE

09:40.314 --> 09:41.880
THAT WAS ACTUALLY
ME UNDER THE COVERS?

09:41.882 --> 09:44.449
I MEAN, WHO WOULD BE
DUMB ENOUGH TO FALL FOR--

09:46.853 --> 09:48.186
HOW DID I
GET OVER THERE?

09:49.289 --> 09:50.956
'CAUSE I'M THE BEST
THERE IS AT WHAT I DO.

09:53.393 --> 09:54.893
NIGHT, NIGHT,
FAKE RILEY.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.862
I WAS ONCE
AS INNOCENT AS YOU.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.397
BUT NOW ALL
I HAVE TO DO

09:59.399 --> 10:00.899
IS CLIMB OUT
THAT WINDOW

10:00.901 --> 10:01.833
AND THEN I AM
JUST LIKE THIS

10:01.835 --> 10:04.269
WICKED WOMAN
OVER HERE.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.937
RILEY, IF YOU
JUST LET IT HAPPEN,

10:05.939 --> 10:07.472
THERE'S A CHANCE WE CAN
ACTUALLY GET AWAY WITH THIS.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.441
RIGHT. SURE.

10:09.443 --> 10:10.842
I'M LETTING IT HAPPEN.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.877
FIRST TIME I EVER TRY
SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

10:12.879 --> 10:14.813
AND I AM GOING TO
GET AWAY WITH IT.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.081
YOU KNOW WHY?

10:16.083 --> 10:17.916
BECAUSE I, LIKE YOU,

10:17.918 --> 10:19.918
HAVE NO
CONSCIENCE.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.453
GREAT.
LET'S GO.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.892
BOOM, BOOM.

10:29.029 --> 10:32.297
OKAY, THIS IS GOING TO BE
AN INTERESTING NIGHT.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.544
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE SNUCK OUT THE WINDOW.

10:46.546 --> 10:48.480
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO
A COLLEGE BEFORE.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.015
THEY'RE GOING TO KNOW
I DON'T BELONG HERE.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.549
DON'T TALK.
JUST ACT LIKE
YOU FIT IN.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.518
I WANT TO TALK
SO BAD.

10:53.519 --> 10:55.486
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO
A COLLEGE BEFORE.

10:55.489 --> 10:58.023
BEAT NOTRE DAME!

10:58.025 --> 11:00.925
(cheering)

11:00.927 --> 11:02.527
MAYA!

11:04.398 --> 11:05.930
GIVE HER BACK.

11:05.932 --> 11:07.098
(cheering)

11:10.270 --> 11:12.937
SEE YOU AT
THE GAME, BOYS.

11:12.939 --> 11:15.407
-RILEY--
-IF YOU TALK HERE,
THEY PICK YOU UP

11:15.409 --> 11:17.042
-AND THEY CARRY YOU.
-THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.610
OH, YEAH?

11:18.612 --> 11:20.211
GAMMA GAMMA NU!

11:20.213 --> 11:21.579
(cheering)

11:27.187 --> 11:28.987
GIVE HER BACK.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.555
(cheering)

11:33.860 --> 11:36.161
I JUST PLEDGED.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.929
I DON'T WANT TO WAIT
FOR COLLEGE TO BE REAL.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.064
I'M STAYING.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.134
WE'RE LEAVING.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.335
WHY?

11:47.040 --> 11:48.540
WE GOT HERE
TOO LATE.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.041
SO HOW LONG DID IT TAKE
FOR YOU GUYS TO GET
COMFORTABLE AROUND HERE?

11:50.043 --> 11:52.143
IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE
YOU MEET, REALLY.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.245
IT'S NICE
TO MEET YOU.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.647
YOU TOO.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.951
HOW DID I THINK
I COULD EVER
COMPETE WITH THEM?

11:59.953 --> 12:01.953
MAYA...

12:01.955 --> 12:04.055
A GAMMA GAMMA GIRL
DOES NOT LET
HER SISTER GIVE UP

12:04.057 --> 12:06.024
AT THE FIRST
SIGN OF TROUBLE.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.959
YOU'RE NOT
A GAMMA GAMMA GIRL.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.160
RY-RY!

12:09.162 --> 12:11.129
YOU TOTALLY
DITCHED US.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.431
I'M DEALING WITH
SOME STUFF, HARRIET.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.966
I SHOULDN'T
TELL YOU THIS,

12:14.968 --> 12:17.001
BUT YOU WERE ALREADY
VOTED BEST FRIEND TO HAVE.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.436
I THOUGHT GRETCHEN
HAD THAT.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.904
NOPE. YOU!

12:19.906 --> 12:21.072
GAMMA SONG?

12:21.074 --> 12:22.907
OF COURSE,
GAMMA SONG.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.677
♪ WE ARE THE SISTERS OF
GAMMA GAMMA NU ♪

12:25.679 --> 12:28.213
♪ WE ARE HUMBLE,
BUT WE'RE BETTER THAN YOU ♪

12:28.215 --> 12:30.982
♪ WE HELP PEOPLE EVERYWHERE,
BUT WE STILL LOVE OUR HAIR ♪

12:30.984 --> 12:33.017
♪ 'CAUSE WE'RE
GAMMA GAMMA NU ♪

12:33.019 --> 12:34.052
♪ WHOO! ♪

12:35.989 --> 12:37.489
Both: STOP IT.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.924
-THAT'S OURS!
-GROW UP.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.227
-I'M LEAVING.
-YOU'RE NOT.

12:42.229 --> 12:45.096
RILEY, HOW DO I EVEN BEGIN
TO COMPETE WITH THOSE
GIRLS IN THERE?

12:45.098 --> 12:46.164
SEE, JOSH?

12:46.166 --> 12:47.699
NOTHING TO
WORRY ABOUT AT ALL.

12:47.701 --> 12:49.300
YOU'RE GOING TO FIT
RIGHT IN HERE.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.069
YEAH, YOU'VE GOT
NEW FRIENDS ALREADY,

12:51.071 --> 12:52.670
AND A NEW LIFE WAITING
AS SOON AS YOU GET HERE.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.075
YEAH, HE'S GONE.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.277
PLEASE TAKE ME HOME.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.679
BOLD WOMEN
MAKE BOLD CHOICES.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.047
WHAT DOES THAT
EVEN MEAN?

13:03.049 --> 13:04.482
IT'S A GAMMA THING.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.050
IT'S WHAT WE SAY
RIGHT BEFORE

13:06.052 --> 13:08.386
WE SHOVE A SISTER
INTO A BOLD CHOICE.

13:24.538 --> 13:27.138
RILEY, CAN I SLEEP
WITH YOU TONIGHT?

13:29.109 --> 13:30.508
YOU'RE NOT
SAYING NO?

13:30.510 --> 13:32.977
DOES THAT MEAN YES?

13:35.081 --> 13:36.447
GOOD NIGHT.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.625
UH-OH.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.761
RILEY'S BEING
A BAD GIRL.

13:49.763 --> 13:51.095
(knocks on door)

13:52.532 --> 13:54.199
AUGGIE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN HERE?

13:54.201 --> 13:55.767
I'M SLEEPING OVER
AT RILEY'S.

13:55.769 --> 13:57.135
WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.336
IS THAT OKAY
WITH RILEY?

13:58.338 --> 14:00.238
-RILEY?
-SHH.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.472
MOM,

14:01.474 --> 14:03.274
SHE'S REALLY SLEEPY.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.443
AREN'T YOU JUST
THE BEST LITTLE BROTHER.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.745
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.248
-GOOD NIGHT.
-NIGHT.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.118
I OWN YOU NOW.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.794
MAYA, RILEY?

14:22.796 --> 14:25.096
YOU KNOW
THESE GIRLS, JOSH?

14:25.098 --> 14:26.631
-HOW YOU DOING?
-WE'RE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL.

14:26.633 --> 14:29.167
OH! THEY CAN'T
BE HERE, JOSH.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.435
NO KIDDING.
RILEY,

14:30.437 --> 14:32.170
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
YOU HAVE TO GO.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.205
YOU'RE RIGHT, JOSH.
WE'RE SORRY.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.207
-THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.
-WAIT.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.076
INTRIGUED.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.143
MAYA?

14:39.145 --> 14:40.745
WHAT WAS YOUR
BAD IDEA?

14:42.148 --> 14:44.649
HE'S HER UNCLE JOSH.
I CALL HIM UNCLE BOING,
BECAUSE LOOK AT HIM.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.186
SHE MADE ME
SNEAK OUT A WINDOW
TO COME HERE.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.388
THAT'S HOW MUCH
SHE LIKES HIM.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.223
BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID

14:52.225 --> 14:53.758
THAT YOU GUYS
WERE WITCHES,

14:53.760 --> 14:55.293
AND THAT YOU WOULD
STEAL HIM FROM HER.

14:56.630 --> 14:58.596
THEY'RE NOT WITCHES,
RILEY. THEY'RE GIRLS

14:58.598 --> 15:00.665
WHO DON'T LIVE AT HOME
ANYMORE AND KNOW
A LOT MORE THAN WE DO.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.801
SORRY WE INTERRUPTED
YOUR EVENING.

15:03.803 --> 15:06.337
OH, I THINK OUR EVENING
HAS JUST BEGUN.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.275
INITIATION!

15:10.277 --> 15:11.175
(screams)

15:15.181 --> 15:16.381
ALL RIGHT.
BRING HER BACK.

15:17.651 --> 15:18.716
ANDREW?

15:19.653 --> 15:20.752
YOU TOLD ME
YOU DIED.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.254
I DID.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.374
I AM.

15:26.375 --> 15:27.124
(whispers)
DON'T FORGET ME.

15:28.862 --> 15:30.261
THEY ALL DIE.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.131
HEY.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.265
HEY.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.300
SO, MAYA,

15:35.302 --> 15:36.668
WHAT DO YOU
SEE IN THIS GUY?

15:36.670 --> 15:38.169
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
HAD A CRUSH ON HIM?

15:38.171 --> 15:40.438
IT'S NOT A CRUSH.
IT ISN'T.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.173
MAYBE I'M NOT
AS OLD AS YOU GUYS,

15:43.109 --> 15:44.642
BUT I KNOW
WHAT I FEEL.

15:44.643 --> 15:46.176
HEY, I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING
LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.479
YEAH, IT MAKES YOU
PRETTY GROWN-UP TO ME.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.581
I JUST THOUGHT IF
I DID SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

15:50.583 --> 15:53.451
THEN HE MIGHT
TAKE ME SERIOUSLY
AND THEN MAYBE WE COULD

15:53.453 --> 15:55.153
COME TO SOME KIND OF
UNDERSTANDING.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.655
WE HAVE AN
UNDERSTANDING.

15:57.657 --> 15:58.690
I STAY HERE,

15:58.692 --> 15:59.724
YOU GO HOME.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.392
-SIT DOWN.
-OKAY.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.396
I'M JUST STUPID,
RIGHT?

16:05.398 --> 16:07.282
HEY.

16:07.283 --> 16:09.167
I WOULD LOVE IF SOMEBODY
DID SOMETHING STUPID FOR ME.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.269
YEAH, IT'S NOT
THE BIG GESTURES

16:11.271 --> 16:13.204
THAT WE DO FOR OTHER PEOPLE
THAT HELP US GROW UP.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.506
BUT THE SMALL CHOICES
YOU MAKE FOR YOURSELF.

16:17.243 --> 16:18.576
OHH.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.846
MAYA TOLD YOU GUYS
ABOUT HER CRUSH.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.247
IT'S NOT A CRUSH.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.150
MAYA,

16:26.152 --> 16:28.286
CAN YOU NAME ONE THING
YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM

16:28.288 --> 16:29.620
THAT YOU LOVE?

16:29.622 --> 16:31.489
HE'S PART OF
YOUR FAMILY, RILEY.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.790
I LOVE
YOUR FAMILY.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.158
AND WE LOVE YOU.

16:34.928 --> 16:36.661
WHAT ABOUT JOSH
IN PARTICULAR?

16:36.663 --> 16:38.296
YEAH, MAYA,
YOU DON'T--

16:38.298 --> 16:40.164
YOU DON'T EVEN
REALLY KNOW ME.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.835
YEAH.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.303
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.472
I DON'T PAY ATTENTION
TO ANYTHING YOU DO.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.540
I DON'T KNOW THAT
YOU DRIVE FROM

16:49.542 --> 16:51.809
PHILADELPHIA TO NEW YORK,
NOT EVEN LOOKING

16:51.811 --> 16:53.211
IF YOU GOT INTO NYU

16:53.213 --> 16:54.779
JUST SO YOU COULD OPEN
YOUR ACCEPTANCE LETTER

16:54.781 --> 16:56.664
IN FRONT OF
YOUR OLDER BROTHER

16:56.665 --> 16:58.548
BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM,
AND YOU WANT HIM
TO BE PROUD OF YOU.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.286
AND I SEE THE WAY
YOU ARE WITH AUGGIE.

17:02.288 --> 17:03.855
A LITTLE KID WHO
LOOKS UP TO YOU

17:06.726 --> 17:08.026
WHO YOU ALWAYS
HAVE TIME FOR.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.327
AND I KNOW THAT EVEN THOUGH
YOU'D RATHER STAY HERE
WITH THESE GIRLS,

17:09.329 --> 17:11.195
YOU'RE GOING TO WALK
RILEY AND ME HOME.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.531
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST
THE KIND OF GUY YOU ARE.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.734
I LIKE YOU.

17:17.804 --> 17:20.538
DUDE, WHAT IS
WRONG WITH YOU?

17:20.540 --> 17:22.306
SHE'S THREE YEARS
YOUNGER THAN ME.

17:22.308 --> 17:23.908
-SIT DOWN.
-YEP-- NO!

17:23.910 --> 17:25.410
NO, BECAUSE I SAT DOWN
THE FIRST TIME,

17:25.412 --> 17:27.311
AND I FEEL LIKE
IF I SIT DOWN THIS TIME

17:27.313 --> 17:30.782
IT WON'T REFLECT
WELL ON ME.

17:30.784 --> 17:32.283
YEAH?

17:32.285 --> 17:33.584
HOW'S THIS
REFLECT ON YOU?

17:33.586 --> 17:35.353
IF YOU DON'T
SIT DOWN,

17:35.355 --> 17:37.789
I'M GONNA TELL
EVERY GIRL ON CAMPUS
THAT YOU BELONG

17:37.791 --> 17:39.590
TO THE BRAVEST GIRL

17:39.592 --> 17:40.858
THAT I HAVE
EVER MET.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.927
I'LL MAKE SURE THAT
NO ONE GOES OUT WITH YOU

17:42.929 --> 17:44.328
THE WHOLE TIME
YOU'RE HERE.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.364
OKAY.

17:46.366 --> 17:47.498
I'LL SIT DOWN.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.300
BUT ONLY BECAUSE
I WANT TO.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.403
MAYA,

17:52.405 --> 17:54.439
HE'S 17
AND YOU'RE 14?

17:54.441 --> 17:55.873
YEAH.

17:55.875 --> 17:59.343
THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE
A REALLY BIG
AGE DIFFERENCE NOW,

17:59.345 --> 18:02.413
BUT HERE IN COLLEGE,
WE LEARN A REALLY
DIFFICULT MATH.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.015
YEAH.

18:04.017 --> 18:06.451
AND WHEN YOU GET HERE,
YOU'LL BE 18

18:06.453 --> 18:08.553
AND HE'LL BE 21.

18:08.554 --> 18:10.654
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT
HE'LL BE SMARTER BECAUSE
HE'LL BE IN COLLEGE.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.257
AND HE JUST MAY BE
SMART ENOUGH

18:13.259 --> 18:14.525
TO LOOK AT YOU
DIFFERENTLY.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.346
OKAY.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.431
THANK YOU GUYS
FOR FIGURING OUT
MY ENTIRE LIFE FOR ME.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.533
BUT THIS HAS BEEN
THE WORST PARTY
OF MY LIFE.

18:24.838 --> 18:25.903
COME ON.
LET'S GO.

18:25.905 --> 18:28.039
OH,
YOU'RE LEAVING?

18:29.709 --> 18:31.375
I'M GONNA
WALK THEM HOME.

18:38.051 --> 18:39.584
NOT SO FAST,
TOOTS.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.452
DON'T YOU
START WITH ME.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.055
I FEEL GREAT,
AND THERE IS NOTHING
THAT YOU CAN SAY

18:44.057 --> 18:45.490
THAT WILL TAKE THAT
AWAY FROM ME.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.525
BECAUSE YOU HAD
THE BEST NIGHT
OF YOUR LIFE?

18:47.527 --> 18:48.776
YEAH.

18:48.777 --> 18:50.026
AND YOU CAN'T WAIT
TO TELL YOUR PARENTS?

18:50.029 --> 18:51.295
YEAH.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.563
IF ONLY YOU HADN'T
LIED TO THEM

18:52.565 --> 18:53.931
AND SNUCK OUT
THE WINDOW.

18:53.933 --> 18:54.966
YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

18:54.968 --> 18:56.400
I KNOW EVERYTHING.

18:56.402 --> 18:58.736
I ALSO KNOW YOU CAN'T
EVER TELL THEM.

19:00.807 --> 19:01.272
OH, YEAH.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.577
ENJOY THE REST
OF YOUR EVENING.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.713
I'LL BE WITH YOU
ALL NIGHT.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.321
THIS IS JUST
HOW YOU LIVE?

19:17.323 --> 19:18.723
YOU JUST
DO BAD STUFF

19:18.725 --> 19:19.991
AND YOU
GET AWAY WITH IT?

19:19.993 --> 19:22.326
IS SOMETHING
BOTHERING YOU,
DARLING?

19:23.429 --> 19:24.962
HELLO.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.464
OKAY,
GO AHEAD.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.332
YOUR FATHER
TRUSTS YOU.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.334
YOUR MOTHER
TRUSTS YOU.

19:31.471 --> 19:32.803
YOUR BROTHER
LIED FOR YOU.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.473
EVERYTHING BAD
IN THE WORLD

19:35.475 --> 19:36.574
IS YOUR FAULT.

19:36.576 --> 19:37.742
WHAT?

19:37.744 --> 19:39.810
NEVER MIND.
THAT'S FOR LATER.

19:42.448 --> 19:44.448
-GOOD MORNING.
-WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE GUY?

19:44.450 --> 19:45.917
WHAT GUY?

19:45.919 --> 19:47.385
THE  <i> TELL-TALE HEART  </i> GUY.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.453
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN
HIS CONSCIENCE

19:49.455 --> 19:50.488
GOT THE BETTER
OF HIM?

19:50.490 --> 19:51.722
OH, THE "BOOM, BOOM" GUY.

19:51.724 --> 19:52.857
YEAH,
HE WENT CRAZY.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.092
CRAZY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WENT CRAZY?

19:55.094 --> 19:57.128
HE FREAKED OUT
FROM A GUILTY CONSCIENCE.

19:57.130 --> 19:58.496
CLASSIC.

19:59.666 --> 20:02.133
HOW DO YOU GET YOUR CONSCIENCE
TO STOP MAKING YOU FEEL GUILTY?

20:02.135 --> 20:05.670
WELL, THE BEST WAY IS TO
NOT DO THE THINGS
YOU SHOULDN'T DO,

20:05.672 --> 20:07.538
BUT IF YOU DO
DO SOMETHING WRONG...

20:07.540 --> 20:08.606
HE SAID "DO DO."

20:08.608 --> 20:12.410
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,
THAT'S JUST YOUR CONSCIENCE

20:12.412 --> 20:14.712
TRYING TO GET YOU
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR IT.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.247
WHY?

20:16.248 --> 20:17.781
BECAUSE WHEN YOU
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

20:17.784 --> 20:19.417
FOR THE THINGS
YOU DO,

20:19.419 --> 20:21.419
THAT'S WHEN YOU
FINALLY BEGIN TO GROW.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.087
SO, LISTENING TO
YOUR CONSCIENCE

20:23.089 --> 20:24.555
-HELPS YOU GROW?
-YEAH.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.924
YOU MIGHT WANT TO
TRY IT SOMETIME.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.461
WELL,
HELLO, MAYA.

20:30.463 --> 20:31.729
IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.398
WHAT THE--?

20:39.672 --> 20:41.606
I WANT TO TELL
MY PARENTS WHAT I DID.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.507
-TOO LATE.
-I WANT TO TELL THEM

20:43.509 --> 20:46.143
HOW MUCH I'M
LOOKING FORWARD TO
GOING TO COLLEGE SOMEDAY.

20:46.145 --> 20:48.779
BECAUSE YOU LOVED
THOSE COLLEGE GIRLS
YOU MET THERE?

20:48.781 --> 20:51.082
THEY WERE SO GREAT.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.984
WHAT?

20:52.986 --> 20:56.454
BECAUSE ONE DAY YOU HOPE
TO BE THOSE KINDS OF GIRLS
YOURSELVES?

20:56.456 --> 20:57.788
YOU KNEW.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.890
THEY KNEW.
PARENTS KNOW EVERYTHING.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.792
NO.
SOMEONE TOLD US.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.663
I JUST WANTED TO
SAY GOODBYE.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.932
VERY INTERESTING VISIT.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.601
JOSH,
YOU TOLD THEM.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.536
TOLD THEM WHAT,
RILEY?

21:12.538 --> 21:14.705
THAT NOTHING HAPPENED?
WHY WOULD I TELL THEM
NOTHING HAPPENED

21:14.707 --> 21:16.540
IF NOTHING HAPPENED?
WHY WOULD I TELL THEM THAT?

21:17.744 --> 21:19.610
IT'S OKAY, JOSH.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.012
MAYA TOLD US.

21:21.014 --> 21:23.080
-WHAT?
-MAYA TOLD US EVERYTHING.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.115
WHY?

21:24.117 --> 21:25.516
I WOULDN'T
RAT YOU OUT, RILEY.

21:26.552 --> 21:28.486
SORRY, CORY.

21:28.488 --> 21:29.654
GUESS I'M STILL
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER, HUH?

21:29.656 --> 21:31.522
NO, JOSH.

21:31.524 --> 21:33.090
YOU WERE SO LOOKING FORWARD
TO MAKING NEW FRIENDS

21:33.092 --> 21:34.592
AT THAT PARTY.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.093
BUT YOU LEFT.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.495
JUST TO MAKE SURE

21:37.497 --> 21:39.063
THAT RILEY AND MAYA
GOT HOME SAFELY.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.099
YOU'RE NOT SO LITTLE
ANYMORE, JOSH.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.503
I GUESS I HAVE TO STOP
LOOKING AT YOU THAT WAY.

21:46.873 --> 21:49.140
THANKS.
THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.841
MAYA,

21:50.843 --> 21:52.543
WHY DID YOU
TELL THEM?

21:52.545 --> 21:54.845
IT WAS A CHOICE
I MADE FOR MYSELF.

21:55.782 --> 21:58.182
I THOUGHT IT WAS
THE GROWN-UP
THING TO DO.

21:58.184 --> 22:00.151
IT WAS.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.752
YOU'RE NOT SO
LITTLE ANYMORE, MAYA.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.655
I GUESS I HAVE TO STOP
LOOKING AT YOU LIKE THAT.

22:04.657 --> 22:05.923
THANKS.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.726
MEANS A LOT TO ME.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.344
RILEY,

22:10.345 --> 22:11.961
ARE YOU EVER GOING TO
PULL SOMETHING
LIKE THIS AGAIN?

22:11.964 --> 22:13.497
NO.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.199
EVEN THOUGH IT MAY HAVE
BEEN A GREAT NIGHT,

22:15.201 --> 22:17.802
IT ISN'T WORTH HOW TERRIBLE
I FEEL FOR NOT TELLING YOU.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.205
THANKS.
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.679
RILEY, WE'RE HAPPY THAT YOU
LIKED YOUR COLLEGE EXPERIENCE.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.881
AND WE'RE SAD TO HAVE TO
GIVE YOU A GROUNDING EXPERIENCE.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.150
TWO WEEKS.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.552
IT SHOULD BE THREE.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.254
DEAL.

22:37.256 --> 22:38.589
IT SHOULD BE THREE.

22:39.559 --> 22:40.591
GET A LIFE.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.595
GOOD NIGHT.
I BRUSHED MY TEETH.

22:44.597 --> 22:45.830
YOU DID NOT.

22:47.567 --> 22:48.999
WHAT THE--?

22:49.001 --> 22:50.201
AUGGIE.

22:50.203 --> 22:52.069
YOU ARE GROUNDED
FOR ONE WEEK

22:52.071 --> 22:53.270
FOR NOT TELLING US

22:53.272 --> 22:54.672
YOUR SISTER SNUCK
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

22:54.674 --> 22:55.740
HOW'S THAT
A BAD THING?

22:55.742 --> 22:57.575
I WAS PROTECTING HER.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.862
LET'S GO,
BLONDIE.

23:01.863 --> 23:03.713
YOU AND I ARE GONNA DO
A LITTLE GROWING UP TOGETHER.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.584
WE'RE GONNA TELL
MY MOTHER, AREN'T WE?

23:06.586 --> 23:08.986
WE'RE GONNA TELL HER
ABOUT A LOT OF STUFF.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.088
YEAH, OKAY.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.156
LET'S GO.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.659
SEE YOU GUYS
IN A YEAR.
