If we see the other flirting,

Any minute now,
I'd receive an email

00:30.353 --> 00:32.320

change my life forever.

And the great thing
about it?

00:34.157 --> 00:35.022
I wasn't scared.

00:35.024 --> 00:36.390
I'd kicked ass
in my interview

00:36.392 --> 00:38.326

the last semester.

00:38.328 --> 00:39.160

I knew that.

00:49.305 --> 00:51.072
- You had no idea
I went here, did you?

00:51.074 --> 00:54.809
- Not until I saw you at
the cafeteria a couple days ago.

00:54.811 --> 00:55.409
I'm sorry.

00:55.411 --> 00:57.345
- But I'm only
two grades below you.

00:57.347 --> 01:00.348
- Wow! Did you go through
a growth spurt?

01:00.350 --> 01:01.482
- A big one, last summer.

01:01.484 --> 01:04.151
Yeah, it was, uh,
very painful.

01:04.153 --> 01:05.920
So listen, um,
you know how you told me

01:05.922 --> 01:10.892

That is so sweet.

Okay, well, I, uh--
I better get running.

well, uh, talk soon, I hope.

Talk to you later.

01:57.206 --> 01:58.940

keeping Owen a secret,

01:58.942 --> 02:00.341
but I didn't want Matty
to find out

02:00.343 --> 02:02.276
that I had broken
our no hook-up pledge.

of getting into SCU.

03:29.432 --> 03:31.132

08:34.370 --> 08:40.441
[Drums beating]

08:40.443 --> 08:41.642
- [Grunts]

08:41.644 --> 08:44.478
- Now, kids, this is
what happens

08:44.480 --> 08:47.614
when you're unable
to resist Tyler.

08:47.616 --> 08:50.451
Oops, I mean lust.

08:50.453 --> 08:55.022
- You shall hate the whore
and make her, like,

08:55.024 --> 08:55.723
really desolate.

08:55.725 --> 08:59.393
Then you'll eat her flesh
and burn her with fire?

08:59.395 --> 09:02.496
Ew, that's not going
to really happen to me, is it?

09:02.498 --> 09:03.764
- We'll see.

09:03.766 --> 09:06.934
And this is
Jesus Christ.

09:06.936 --> 09:09.970
[Dramatic music]

09:09.972 --> 09:11.905
- If thou shalt
disobey me ever,

09:11.907 --> 09:14.375
I will see to it
that you all go to hell.

09:14.377 --> 09:16.543
So don't swear,
don't drink,

09:16.545 --> 09:20.748
and never, ever wear
those horrific outfits

09:20.750 --> 09:22.583
in my presence again.

09:22.585 --> 09:25.452
Jesus says,
"you're welcome."

09:25.454 --> 09:25.853
- Gosh,

09:25.855 --> 09:27.621
where's your father
when you need him?

09:27.623 --> 09:31.392
- Honey, sweetheart,
I am so sorry I'm late.

09:31.394 --> 09:32.793
That massage was so deep,

09:32.795 --> 09:34.995
I just dozed off
right there on the table.

09:34.997 --> 09:37.431
- I'm just glad
you made it.

09:37.433 --> 09:38.665
Do you like my costume?

09:38.667 --> 09:39.700
It's cute, huh?

09:39.702 --> 09:41.135
- Sure, sure.

09:41.137 --> 09:42.936
But, Tyler, wowza!

09:42.938 --> 09:44.605
You must be lust.

09:44.607 --> 09:45.606
- Indeed I am.

09:45.608 --> 09:47.441
- Doesn't he fit
the part perfectly?

09:47.443 --> 09:50.778
Oh, here, Tyler.
Spray on some oil.

09:50.780 --> 09:54.748
Lust should be all
hot and sweaty.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.617
[Giggles]

09:56.619 --> 09:58.919
- Lissa, when are you
going to tell your mom

09:58.921 --> 10:00.721
that your dad is
a big gay gay?

10:00.723 --> 10:02.456
- That was
a one-time thing, Sadie.

10:02.458 --> 10:03.924
I think he
was just confused.

10:03.926 --> 10:08.128
- Can't be easy to come out to a
judgmental slore like your mom.

10:08.130 --> 10:09.496
- My mom's not judgmental.

10:09.498 --> 10:10.731
She just knows
right from wrong.

10:10.733 --> 10:13.700
- She's punishing you
for having feelings for Tyler

10:13.702 --> 10:17.838
when there's nothing
wrong with it.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.441
And I thought my family
was [Bleep] up.

10:20.443 --> 10:23.477
- As a woman,
it can be difficult

10:23.479 --> 10:24.511
being in
an all-boys club.

10:24.513 --> 10:29.917
But in the end, hard work
is what will bring you success,

10:29.919 --> 10:32.052
not your gender.

10:34.789 --> 10:35.889
- I got to go.

10:35.891 --> 10:38.525
- Where are you going?

10:38.527 --> 10:40.094
- Jake?

10:40.096 --> 10:41.962
What are you
doing here?

10:41.964 --> 10:43.230
You stalking me?

10:43.232 --> 10:44.031
- [Chuckles]

10:44.033 --> 10:47.534
No, I, um... I have a booth.

10:47.536 --> 10:49.169
- Really?
Where?

10:49.171 --> 10:49.770
- Um...

10:49.772 --> 10:53.474
- I just wanted to say wow,
what a wonderful speech.

10:53.476 --> 10:55.542
And as a fellow feminist
in the struggle,

10:55.544 --> 11:00.047
I applaud you for being
such a bad-ass.

11:00.049 --> 11:01.748
And you, Mr. Rosati,

11:01.750 --> 11:03.217
I'll be seeing
in detention later.

11:03.219 --> 11:06.220
Pantsing a freshman
in gym class?

11:06.222 --> 11:08.989
Very original.

11:09.757 --> 11:11.792
- Uh... I know you must be

11:11.794 --> 11:13.594
really confused right now,

11:13.596 --> 11:17.931
but I can explain.
I--

11:17.933 --> 11:19.099
- we can't talk here.

11:19.101 --> 11:22.769
Meet me at my car
in an hour.

11:22.771 --> 11:24.805
- Was that your
New Year's M.I.L.F?

11:24.807 --> 11:25.539
- Oh, yeah.

11:25.541 --> 11:28.876
- I think you're the one
with a little crush.

11:28.878 --> 11:30.711
[Chuckles]

11:30.879 --> 11:33.814
- Jenna, that author,
Samantha Perry, is here.

11:33.816 --> 11:36.116
She went to PHHS and SCU.

11:36.118 --> 11:37.151
Aren't you a fan
of hers?

11:37.153 --> 11:39.987
- Yes.
Dad, please spare me.

11:39.989 --> 11:43.991
- I can spare me.
Let's go.

11:46.127 --> 11:47.661
- Sign me up
for the next season of

11:47.663 --> 11:49.763
<i>The Bad Girls Club,</i>
'cause I just did three things

11:49.765 --> 11:52.533
on my [Bleep] it list at once.
[Chuckles]

11:52.535 --> 11:53.534
Cut class, check.

11:53.536 --> 11:54.768
Break dress code,
check.

11:54.770 --> 11:56.937
And smoke an e-cig
in the sanctuary,

11:56.939 --> 11:57.871
hell, yeah, check.

11:57.873 --> 12:01.175
Oh. Hi,
Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton.

12:01.177 --> 12:04.077
So, Jenna, is SCU still
being a distant diva?

12:04.079 --> 12:09.917
- Hey. My daughter Jenna,
two n's, loves your work.

12:09.919 --> 12:12.052
She wants to be a writer
just like you

12:12.054 --> 12:13.921
when she grows up.
- Mom, stop.

12:13.923 --> 12:14.855
- Aw, that's great.

12:14.857 --> 12:18.125
- She's planning on studying
creative writing at SCU.

12:18.127 --> 12:19.193
- Yeah!
- Oh, wow.

12:19.195 --> 12:20.594
They have
an incredible program.

12:20.596 --> 12:22.696
They whipped my butt
into shape.

12:22.698 --> 12:24.331
- Oh, [Chuckles]
- Mom, stop.

12:24.333 --> 12:27.568
- "Dear, Jenna, congrats
on SCU." [Chuckles]

12:27.570 --> 12:28.335
- Isn't that sweet?

12:28.337 --> 12:29.970
- I didn't get in, okay?

12:29.972 --> 12:34.575
I didn't get in to SCU.

12:36.177 --> 12:39.980
- Oh, no, your friend
and now you too?

12:39.982 --> 12:42.883
Oh, bummer.

12:45.853 --> 12:48.922
- Uh, that's why.
That's why I didn't tell you.

12:48.924 --> 12:50.791
Because the look dad's
giving me.

12:50.793 --> 12:51.325
- What look?

12:51.327 --> 12:55.662
- The look
of utter disappointment.

12:55.664 --> 12:56.930
- Jenna, I'm so sorry.

12:56.932 --> 12:58.265
I can't believe
you didn't get in.

12:58.267 --> 13:00.867
- Me either.
You puked on someone's desk

13:00.869 --> 13:01.768
and you made the cut.

13:01.770 --> 13:02.970
Doesn't seem fair,
does it?

13:02.972 --> 13:04.071
- Slow your roll, cowgirl.

13:04.073 --> 13:06.073
I worked my type-a ass
off for four years.

13:06.075 --> 13:08.108
You just got your [Bleep]
together four months ago.

13:08.110 --> 13:09.743
- Sorry, I couldn't tell
if it was the four years

13:09.745 --> 13:12.246
of hard work or the BS
doctor notes you sent in.

13:12.248 --> 13:14.214
- Okay, I'm going to go
before you say

13:14.216 --> 13:15.415
something else
you'll regret.

13:15.417 --> 13:17.718
Call me
when you calm down.

13:17.720 --> 13:18.719
- You need to calm down.

13:18.721 --> 13:19.853
- I can't, Tyler!

13:19.855 --> 13:20.687
Sadie's right.

13:20.689 --> 13:24.091
Everyone in my family
is a giant liar.

13:27.161 --> 13:28.895
- Children,
where are you?

13:28.897 --> 13:32.399
A new crop of sinners
have arrived.

13:33.935 --> 13:34.334
- Sorry.

13:34.336 --> 13:38.272
Tyler and I had to...
go potty.

13:39.474 --> 13:40.307
- That's it.

13:40.309 --> 13:41.775
If you won't listen
to your parents,

13:41.777 --> 13:44.177
you're going to
a Christian boarding school,

13:44.179 --> 13:47.714
where you will listen
to God.

13:48.750 --> 13:52.252
- I'm sorry if my relationship
with Tyler upsets you guys.

13:52.254 --> 13:54.254
But I'd rather go
to boarding school

13:54.256 --> 13:56.256
than not be open
about the person I love.

13:56.258 --> 13:59.293
A life where you can't
be honest about who you are

13:59.295 --> 14:05.899
is like living in a stupid
hell tent of your own making.

14:07.835 --> 14:11.271
- Lovebun, there's something
I've got to tell you.

14:11.273 --> 14:13.106
- What is it, Joe?

14:13.108 --> 14:13.807
- Well...

14:13.809 --> 14:15.942
Wow, this is
a lot harder than I thought.

14:15.944 --> 14:18.178
- For the love of Christ,
just say it, darling.

14:18.180 --> 14:19.446
- Satan has
made me afflicted

14:19.448 --> 14:22.282
with a very powerful
attraction to men.

14:22.284 --> 14:23.083
But don't worry.

14:23.085 --> 14:25.519
Because I have decided to
attend a Christian retreat

14:25.521 --> 14:28.221
where they can cure
homosexuality.

14:28.223 --> 14:29.456
Because I'll do
whatever it takes

14:29.458 --> 14:30.824
to keep this family
together.

14:30.826 --> 14:33.527
Even if it means
spending hours of repentance

14:33.529 --> 14:36.830
with other wayward men.

14:36.832 --> 14:37.230
- [Sobs]

14:37.232 --> 14:41.134
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Hey,

14:41.136 --> 14:44.204
I'll be a missionary.

14:44.206 --> 14:47.941
It'll be fun.

14:52.146 --> 14:53.880
- Hey.

14:53.882 --> 14:54.481
- Hey.

14:54.483 --> 14:56.350
- Can I sit down?

14:56.352 --> 14:58.218
- Sure.

14:59.821 --> 15:01.955
- I know you're bummed
you didn't get into SCU.

15:01.957 --> 15:03.323
But here's
the silver lining:

15:03.325 --> 15:06.259
All the pain you're feeling
will fuel your writing.

15:06.261 --> 15:08.895
- But how much pain
is a writer supposed to take?

15:08.897 --> 15:10.997
I mean, I'm not even
out of high school yet,

15:10.999 --> 15:13.400
and I already feel
like I've had my fill.

15:13.402 --> 15:14.368
- [Chuckles]
A lot.

15:14.370 --> 15:17.371
Being a professional writer
is a freaking nightmare.

15:17.373 --> 15:19.506
It's filled
with never-ending rejection.

15:19.508 --> 15:21.475
Only an insane person
would pursue it.

15:21.477 --> 15:24.578
But guess what?
I didn't have a choice.

15:24.580 --> 15:27.114
Telling stories is
the only way I know how

15:27.116 --> 15:30.450
to make sense
of the world around me.

15:30.452 --> 15:33.987
Don't you feel
the same way?

15:33.989 --> 15:34.888
- Yeah, I guess I do.

15:34.890 --> 15:37.457
- Then you're going
to be fine.

15:37.459 --> 15:41.428
I'm not worried
about you, Jenna.

15:42.063 --> 15:44.064
- Thank you.

15:44.066 --> 15:45.365
- Listen, Jake,
if I had known

15:45.367 --> 15:47.534
you were in high school,
I never would have kissed you.

15:47.536 --> 15:49.002
- I'm sorry
for not telling you.

15:49.004 --> 15:52.072
[Chuckles]
It's just you're so hot.

15:52.074 --> 15:54.307
I-I got caught up
in the moment.

15:54.309 --> 15:55.876
- You're a good-looking
young man.

15:55.878 --> 15:58.478
I just can't believe
you're so young.

15:58.480 --> 15:59.980
- I'm not that young.
I'm 18.

15:59.982 --> 16:02.849
But I get it,
and I'll see you around.

16:02.851 --> 16:04.885
- Wait, you're 18?

16:04.887 --> 16:05.852
- Yeah.

16:05.854 --> 16:06.386
- Oh, thank God.

16:06.388 --> 16:08.455
- Oh, that means we can't
get in trouble, right?

16:08.457 --> 16:14.127
- Legally we're fine.
Morally... eh.

16:16.431 --> 16:18.932
- What?

16:18.934 --> 16:19.933
Come on.

16:19.935 --> 16:21.902
- Oh, screw it.

16:27.208 --> 16:28.642
- Thanks for
the ride home.

16:28.644 --> 16:32.078
- Yeah, no worries.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.880
Are you okay?

16:33.882 --> 16:34.648
You seem a little bummed.

16:34.650 --> 16:38.385
- Yeah, I guess I've just been
a little down on myself lately.

16:38.387 --> 16:39.119
- Yeah, me too.

16:39.121 --> 16:42.923
In fact, I was going
to ask you something.

16:42.925 --> 16:45.892
Why did you go out
with me?

16:45.894 --> 16:47.027
- Don't play dumb.

16:47.029 --> 16:48.495
- I'm not.

16:48.497 --> 16:49.329
- You know why.

16:49.331 --> 16:51.264
Because you're
Matty McKibben.

16:51.266 --> 16:52.199
- Thanks, but apparently

16:52.201 --> 16:53.667
that's not good enough
for Gabby.

16:53.669 --> 16:55.569
- You mean intimidation
nation Gabby?

16:55.571 --> 16:56.903
- Okay, is there like
a club

16:56.905 --> 16:58.238
where you guys meet
and name everything?

16:58.240 --> 17:01.641
- I thought you weren't
doing relationships this year.

17:01.643 --> 17:02.909
- Who said relationships?

17:02.911 --> 17:04.978
I can barely get the girl
to talk to me.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.680
I mean,
what the [Bleep]?

17:06.682 --> 17:09.649
I mean, did I peak
junior year or something?

17:09.651 --> 17:11.618
[Chuckles]

17:11.620 --> 17:14.187
- Matty, I didn't
get into SCU.

17:14.189 --> 17:16.389
- Aw, I'm sorry.

17:16.391 --> 17:18.225
I think they get
their answers out so early

17:18.227 --> 17:20.227
because they just
toss a coin.

17:20.229 --> 17:23.163
Come on, you haven't even heard
from the best schools yet.

17:23.165 --> 17:24.097
And you know what?

17:24.099 --> 17:26.967
I really think you
dodged a bullet.

17:26.969 --> 17:27.400
- Why?

17:27.402 --> 17:29.336
- Dude, have you seen
their school mascot?

17:29.338 --> 17:30.504
It's a fricking moth.

17:30.506 --> 17:35.041
How embarrassing is that?
[Chuckles]

17:35.043 --> 17:36.276
- Well, thanks.

17:36.278 --> 17:38.278
Do you want to come in?
- I can't.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.714
I will be at home
trying to figure out

17:40.716 --> 17:44.217
how to get
my swag back.

17:44.219 --> 17:45.018
- Okay.

17:45.020 --> 17:47.988
Well, I'll talk
to you later.

17:47.990 --> 17:49.155
- Bye.

17:49.157 --> 17:50.357
- ♪ I can preach

17:50.359 --> 17:53.059
♪ take me with you
when you go ♪

17:53.061 --> 17:55.695
- with no plans of
platonic Matty distraction,

17:55.697 --> 17:56.730
it was time
to move on

17:56.732 --> 18:01.034
and push eject on this day
of rejection.

18:02.703 --> 18:04.104
- Yes, her name is Jenna
with two n's.

18:04.106 --> 18:06.339
I'd like to talk to the director
of admissions, please.

18:06.341 --> 18:09.543
- You made a big mistake,
buddy. Big.

18:09.545 --> 18:12.779
- Mom, dad,
put the phone down now.

18:14.248 --> 18:16.883
- Look, we're sorry, honey.
We didn't mean to embarrass you.

18:16.885 --> 18:19.719
We just wanted to know why
you didn't get in.

18:19.721 --> 18:22.556
- I wish I could send
that admissions board

18:22.558 --> 18:25.191
a big steaming pile
of [Bleep]!

18:25.193 --> 18:26.793
- You guys, it's okay.

18:26.795 --> 18:28.828
It's not SCU's fault,
it's mine.

18:28.830 --> 18:32.265
Let's be honest, my junior year
grades were not great,

18:32.267 --> 18:35.502
and I didn't have any
extracurricular activities

18:35.504 --> 18:36.703
until this year.

18:36.705 --> 18:37.704
I understand their decision.

18:37.706 --> 18:41.308
So thank you, dad,
for driving me up to campus

18:41.310 --> 18:42.242
and showing me around

18:42.244 --> 18:46.179
and, mom, for being there
and supporting me.

18:46.181 --> 18:49.916
Now, let's just
forget it, okay?

18:49.918 --> 18:51.318
- [Sniffs]

18:51.320 --> 18:52.819
- Wow, I'm so proud
of you.

18:52.821 --> 18:56.323
You're handling
this rejection very well.

18:56.325 --> 18:59.659
- Well, if I'm going
to be a writer,

18:59.661 --> 19:02.262
I better get used to it.

19:02.264 --> 19:05.432
It was then that I realized
rejection is easier to accept

19:05.434 --> 19:08.702
when you're honest with yourself
about the reasons why.

19:08.704 --> 19:11.938
And I knew someone who really
deserved some clarity.

19:11.940 --> 19:13.873
Listen, I'm sorry
to be such a stalker

19:13.875 --> 19:15.275
and show up
at your house like this,

19:15.277 --> 19:16.576
but I tried to talk to you
at school--

19:16.578 --> 19:18.878
- Jenna, it's--it's okay.
What's up?

19:18.880 --> 19:22.215
- I'm sorry about
what happened earlier.

19:22.217 --> 19:25.485
I had a really bad day
and I took it out on you,

19:25.487 --> 19:28.221
and you didn't
deserve that.

19:28.223 --> 19:29.889
- What happened?

19:29.891 --> 19:33.693
- I didn't get into SCU.

19:33.695 --> 19:36.429
- Oh, man, I-I'm sorry.

19:36.431 --> 19:37.263
- It's fine.

19:37.265 --> 19:39.766
I have accepted it
and I'm moving on.

19:39.768 --> 19:41.935
- Good. You can't let
some dumb people

19:41.937 --> 19:44.237
on a college acceptance
board have, like,

19:44.239 --> 19:45.438
total power over
your feelings.

19:45.440 --> 19:49.576
- It's hard not to.
- Jenna, I've been told "no"

19:49.578 --> 19:51.678
more times than I can count.

19:51.680 --> 19:53.246
Like, pretty recently.

19:53.248 --> 19:56.249
So, yeah, you know,
it sucks for a minute,

19:56.251 --> 19:59.319
but then, I don't know,
I get a feeling

19:59.321 --> 20:01.821
that it'll all work out.

20:05.493 --> 20:09.896
And I'm not just gonna stop
going after the things I want.

20:09.898 --> 20:12.599
So you shouldn't
either, okay?

20:12.601 --> 20:15.435
- I won't.
I promise.

20:15.437 --> 20:17.003
- Okay.

20:18.572 --> 20:21.808
- Whoa. Who knew Owen
was this confident?

20:21.810 --> 20:24.477
It felt so good
to have him believe in me.

20:24.479 --> 20:27.580
It felt... so good.

20:27.582 --> 20:29.549
Wow, really good.

20:29.551 --> 20:32.252
- ♪ I'll get you started ♪

20:32.254 --> 20:36.556
♪ we can't stay
brokenhearted ♪

20:38.359 --> 20:39.092
- next on <i>Awkward...</i>

20:39.094 --> 20:40.326
- Senior bonfire tonight.

20:40.328 --> 20:41.594
- The guys keep
a "Hot Or Not" list

20:41.596 --> 20:43.329
in a big book
called "The Phone Book."

20:43.331 --> 20:44.597
- What jerk hate-rated you?

20:44.599 --> 20:45.565
- You coded me?

20:45.567 --> 20:46.833
- Hey, beautiful.

20:46.835 --> 20:47.801
- Too bad hitting that

20:47.803 --> 20:49.335
would be a one-way ticket
to cougar town.

20:49.337 --> 20:51.538
- Well, apparently
all I am to you is a number.

20:51.540 --> 20:52.439
- I made a dude database

20:52.441 --> 20:53.740
with every guy at PHHS's
profile pic.

20:53.742 --> 20:57.644
I'm gonna hate-rate the [Bleep]
outta these jockoffs.
