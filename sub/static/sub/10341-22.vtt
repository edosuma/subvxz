WEBVTT

01:42.644 --> 01:45.479
Were you afraid, Punky?

01:46.272 --> 01:50.651
I was on the stage at the Roadhouse,
and the lights went out.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.194
I kept thinking:

01:52.362 --> 01:54.696
"The lights are going out,
the lights are going out."

01:54.864 --> 01:57.074
And then they did.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.285
And it all went black,
and I kept thinking:

02:00.453 --> 02:02.412
"It's so dark,
what about hand signals?

02:02.580 --> 02:04.623
What good would they do us now?

02:04.791 --> 02:08.335
And the baby, what if the lights
went out in the hospital

02:08.503 --> 02:11.046
and we were in the elevator?"

02:11.214 --> 02:14.383
Then I'd help you have that baby
right there in the elevator,

02:14.551 --> 02:17.761
in front of God and everybody.

02:25.186 --> 02:26.854
- I love you.
- I love you.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.456
Coop, I've got deputies
from three counties looking for Earle.

02:46.624 --> 02:48.292
He seems to have
completely disappeared.

02:48.459 --> 02:50.335
Harry, the only hope we have
of finding them

02:50.503 --> 02:53.172
is somewhere in this map.

02:55.842 --> 03:00.053
Giant, little man,

03:00.638 --> 03:05.184
fire, fire walk with me.

03:09.731 --> 03:13.775
Fire walk with me.

03:16.279 --> 03:19.865
Grand theft auto.

03:23.161 --> 03:27.080
The Log Lady stole my truck.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.961
'68 Dodge pickup.

03:33.129 --> 03:34.546
Powder blue.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.049
I tried to chase after her,
but she took off

03:37.258 --> 03:39.593
on the road up towards the woods.

03:40.637 --> 03:44.973
Pete, the Log Lady
did not steal your truck.

03:45.141 --> 03:48.477
The Log Lady will be here
in one minute.

03:50.146 --> 03:53.398
The woods, Harry,

03:53.566 --> 03:57.903
- Ghostwood forest.
- Ghostwood?

04:01.866 --> 04:05.744
Twelve rainbow trouts in the bed.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.412
Twelve.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.791
Wait a doggone minute.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.627
There's a circle of 12 sycamores.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.129
Glastonbury Grove.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.923
Sycamores.

04:18.132 --> 04:21.677
That's where I found the bloody towel
and the pages of the diary.

04:24.138 --> 04:27.015
The legendary
burial place of King Arthur.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.767
Glastonbury.

04:28.977 --> 04:33.146
King Arthur's buried in England.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.528
Well, last I heard anyway.

04:42.865 --> 04:44.825
Right on time.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.869
It's the Log Lady.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.711
Where's my truck?

04:55.878 --> 04:59.339
Pete, Windom Earle stole your truck.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.095
I brought the oil.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.930
Thank you, Margaret.

05:07.098 --> 05:11.268
It sure looked to me like you.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.021
Margaret,

05:14.188 --> 05:17.983
what did your husband
say exactly about this oil?

05:19.319 --> 05:23.655
He brought it back one night
just before he died and said:

05:23.823 --> 05:28.160
"This oil is an opening to a gateway."

05:29.996 --> 05:32.748
Intriguing, isn't it?

05:41.591 --> 05:43.008
Jacoby.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.802
- Scorched engine oil.
- Scorched engine oil.

05:45.970 --> 05:49.556
Hawk, bring in Ronette Pulaski.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.397
Ronette, thanks for coming in.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.193
Do you recognize this smell?

06:10.328 --> 06:12.412
Yes.

06:13.247 --> 06:16.500
The night Laura Palmer was killed.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.977
Glastonbury Grove.

06:37.146 --> 06:39.981
I am Windom Earle.

06:40.566 --> 06:41.775
Windom Earle?

06:44.612 --> 06:46.405
Take a look at that.

06:46.572 --> 06:49.658
Twelve rainbow trout.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.285
If you're gonna kill me,
get it over with.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.329
There's plenty of time for that.

06:54.497 --> 06:58.083
But I do like the fear I'm feeling.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.514
Our bones are scattered
at the grave's mouth,

07:12.682 --> 07:14.266
as when one cutteth
wood upon the earth.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.226
But mine eyes are unto thee,
O God the Lord:

07:16.394 --> 07:17.769
in thee is my trust;
leave not my...

07:17.937 --> 07:19.813
Keep me from the snares
they have laid for me,

07:19.981 --> 07:21.648
and the gins of the workers
of iniquity.

07:21.816 --> 07:25.777
Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
whilst that I withal escape.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.823
What are we doing here?

07:37.039 --> 07:43.044
You and I have an appointment
at the end of the world.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.133
- He'll come for me.
- No, he won't.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.761
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Same thing happened last time.

07:51.929 --> 07:54.014
When he fell in love with my wife.

07:54.182 --> 07:57.184
I took the boy right to the edge
that time.

07:57.894 --> 08:02.105
Come in, come in to the circle!

08:06.027 --> 08:09.112
I tell you, they have not died.

08:09.280 --> 08:14.784
Their hands clasp, yours and mine.

08:20.208 --> 08:23.168
You'll not run from me now,

08:24.962 --> 08:28.089
not in this circle of trees.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.719
You'll come with me.

09:03.125 --> 09:06.795
Remember, 20 minutes on
and 20 minutes off with the ice bag.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.214
It'll help with the swelling,
both of you.

09:09.382 --> 09:13.718
Take some aspirin,
call me in the morning.

09:15.429 --> 09:17.430
Thanks, doc.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.018
Oh. Does it hurt much, baby?

09:22.228 --> 09:24.854
God, Nadine,
I was so worried about you.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.857
I admit there were times
when I had my doubts

09:28.025 --> 09:33.572
about what we meant to each other,
but seeing that sandbag hit you,

09:34.323 --> 09:36.449
I just knew

09:36.742 --> 09:40.036
I'd practically do anything for you.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.372
And then the tree hit me.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.129
I love you.

09:53.593 --> 09:58.096
There, I've said it and I'm glad.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.397
Who are you?

10:07.773 --> 10:09.566
Mike.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.736
You...

10:14.155 --> 10:18.950
You try to...
You say your name is Mike?

10:19.702 --> 10:22.037
What are you doing in my house?

10:24.248 --> 10:25.707
You brought me here, Nadine.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.959
No!

10:28.169 --> 10:30.420
No, you get out of here!

10:30.838 --> 10:34.716
Ed, make him go away.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.719
What's she doing here?

10:40.097 --> 10:41.681
Oh.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.268
It's not fair.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.397
Please...

10:50.149 --> 10:51.733
Ed, make...

11:00.826 --> 11:04.245
Where are my drape runners?
Where are my drape runners?

11:04.413 --> 11:06.831
Nadine, how old are you?

11:06.999 --> 11:09.626
What kind of a stupid question
is that?

11:09.794 --> 11:12.504
Answer me. How old are you?

11:12.672 --> 11:16.049
Thirty-five, you moron!

11:25.393 --> 11:27.602
I'm sorry, Ed.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.690
I think I let things
get a little out of hand.

11:32.316 --> 11:34.734
Oh, no. No.

11:54.338 --> 11:57.132
Donna, please.
Donna, please, listen.

11:57.341 --> 11:59.509
- I've heard enough!
- Please, just let me explain.

11:59.677 --> 12:02.011
- Donna...
- Leave me alone!

12:02.513 --> 12:05.849
It isn't your parents' fault. It's mine.

12:06.058 --> 12:09.394
My parents?
Who are my parents anyway?

12:09.895 --> 12:14.733
I only wanted to do good.
I wanted to be good.

12:15.276 --> 12:19.863
And it felt so good to tell the truth

12:21.240 --> 12:23.783
after all these years.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.624
Ben, damn it.

12:32.918 --> 12:36.421
- Will.
- Donna.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.299
Ben, I warned you.
Get out of my house.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.718
Will,

12:42.762 --> 12:47.849
can you forgive me
for what I have done to you?

12:55.608 --> 12:59.652
Sylvia, I told you to stay home.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.947
What are you trying to do
to this family?

13:03.407 --> 13:07.786
Daddy, you're my daddy.
You're my daddy.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.455
You're my daddy.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.541
Daddy.

13:13.751 --> 13:16.503
Leave my family alone!

13:16.712 --> 13:18.338
Now, Will. Will!

13:18.547 --> 13:19.964
- Will!
- Unh!

13:20.174 --> 13:21.424
No!

13:46.534 --> 13:50.829
Ah. I knew I'd seen it somewhere.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.623
Safety deposit box.

13:57.753 --> 14:00.755
They'll never notice the difference.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.933
Oh, Andrew.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.937
Good night, Pete.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.804
Harry,

14:50.472 --> 14:52.265
this way.

15:21.837 --> 15:23.671
Coop?

15:28.928 --> 15:33.348
Harry, I have to go on alone.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.350
Why?

15:36.518 --> 15:38.061
What?

16:47.881 --> 16:49.257
Oh.

16:50.217 --> 16:52.760
Sycamore trees.

17:12.990 --> 17:16.409
An opening to a gateway.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.001
Footprints.

18:19.681 --> 18:22.266
My God.

18:39.159 --> 18:52.713
Under the sycamore tree

19:33.714 --> 19:40.511
And I'll see you

19:40.721 --> 19:45.224
And you'll see me

19:45.392 --> 19:50.730
And I'll see you in the branches

19:50.898 --> 20:01.032
That blow in the breeze

20:02.034 --> 20:17.506
I'll see you in the trees

20:19.134 --> 20:32.021
Under the sycamore tree

21:00.175 --> 21:10.518
Sheriff Truman?

21:10.686 --> 21:13.521
Andy! Over here!

21:52.936 --> 21:57.231
Been about ten hours
since he went in there.

22:03.780 --> 22:06.824
Do you want a thermos of coffee?

22:11.413 --> 22:13.414
Yeah.

22:16.209 --> 22:19.879
Do you want a plate special?

22:24.968 --> 22:26.886
Yeah.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.933
Do you want dessert?

22:38.106 --> 22:39.982
Yeah.

22:42.527 --> 22:44.862
Do you want pie?

22:49.242 --> 22:55.081
Harry?

23:06.927 --> 23:10.471
- Morning, Mr. Mibbler.
- Audrey Horne.

23:10.639 --> 23:15.351
This is my fortunate day.

23:20.399 --> 23:23.275
Is there anything I can do for you?

23:23.443 --> 23:27.154
As a matter of fact, there is.
You can call the Twin Peaks Gazette.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.994
Ask to speak
with Dwayne Milford Jr.

23:34.204 --> 23:35.663
- Dwayne?
- The editor.

23:35.872 --> 23:37.456
Eh?

23:37.624 --> 23:42.253
Heh.
We must make a telephone call.

23:47.134 --> 23:50.928
- Uh, yes?
- Yes.

23:51.096 --> 23:54.515
Tell him that Audrey Horne
has chained herself

23:54.683 --> 23:57.268
to the Twin Peaks
Savings and Loan vault

23:57.436 --> 23:59.854
in protest of their financial ties

24:00.021 --> 24:02.231
to the Ghostwood
Development Project.

24:02.732 --> 24:06.527
And that I intend to stay here
until a town meeting is held

24:06.695 --> 24:08.737
to debate the future
of our environment

24:08.947 --> 24:12.992
and specifically the effect
of the Ghostwood Project upon it.

24:13.160 --> 24:16.787
- Okay?
- Yeah, miss.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.998
And can I get a glass of water,
please?

24:19.749 --> 24:21.500
Uh... Uh...

25:06.713 --> 25:08.756
Thank you, Dell.

25:37.994 --> 25:41.205
You, you.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.414
You!

25:42.582 --> 25:46.794
Heh, heh. Dell Mibbler,
as I live and breathe.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.754
He's alive.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.714
But the funeral.

25:50.882 --> 25:55.010
And all of the flowers,
and the choir boys.

25:55.178 --> 25:58.138
I was hoping you could do
a small favor for me.

25:58.306 --> 25:59.807
Does this look familiar to you?

25:59.975 --> 26:03.936
Yes, it's one
of our safety deposit keys.

26:04.104 --> 26:09.358
- Aha. Shall we?
- Well, of course.

26:09.526 --> 26:15.239
But there is going to be
a bit of a problem.

26:17.492 --> 26:19.952
A bit of a problem.

26:27.127 --> 26:29.628
- Hi, Pete.
- Audrey?

26:29.796 --> 26:33.215
Young lady, why are you
chained to the bank vault?

26:33.383 --> 26:35.384
Civil disobedience.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.845
Ah. Ha, ha.

26:38.013 --> 26:41.181
Waste no time arguing
what a good man should be, be one.

26:41.349 --> 26:45.227
Marcus Aurelius.
I admire your verve.

26:45.395 --> 26:49.857
I see no problem here.
If you'll excuse us, please?

26:50.025 --> 26:51.859
Sure.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.453
Did you call the Gazette yet?

27:02.621 --> 27:07.249
Maybe you should call the sheriff too.
Ask for Agent Cooper.

27:13.340 --> 27:16.592
Give me the key.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.349
A boy? It's a boy!

28:05.558 --> 28:08.352
It's a boy, it's a boy.

28:08.520 --> 28:12.773
- So long.
- So long.

28:16.569 --> 28:19.279
We've come to the end
of a long road, Pete.

28:19.447 --> 28:21.740
And here we are.

28:27.622 --> 28:29.164
Oh, sh...!

28:49.894 --> 28:51.270
Mm.

29:05.493 --> 29:10.164
Shelly, I think we should get married.

29:10.331 --> 29:11.457
Bobby.

29:13.918 --> 29:18.088
Leo. I'm still wearing his ring.

29:27.348 --> 29:29.183
Oh, what kept us, Heidi?

29:29.350 --> 29:31.477
Seconds on knackwurst
this morning?

29:32.187 --> 29:34.062
I couldn't get my car started.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.399
Too busy jump-starting the old man.

29:37.567 --> 29:38.942
- Again.
- Again.

29:40.862 --> 29:43.822
I thought you Germans
were always on time.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.083
- Shelly...
- Bobby.

29:55.251 --> 29:58.504
Leo's probably up in the woods
having the time of his life.

30:05.011 --> 30:08.597
Well, you were right,
there's the major.

30:15.855 --> 30:18.607
Excuse us, Major Briggs,
for the intrusion,

30:18.775 --> 30:23.237
but Sarah here had a message for you
that she thought was important.

30:23.404 --> 30:25.364
Sarah.

30:36.167 --> 30:43.382
