00:01.847 --> 00:02.781
Previously on
"Criminal Minds"...

00:02.848 --> 00:04.949
I got her!
No, no, no. No, Emily.

00:05.017 --> 00:07.752
Stay with me.
Come on, stay with me.

00:07.820 --> 00:09.421
Where's my medic?!

00:09.488 --> 00:13.024
She never made it
off the table.

00:13.092 --> 00:15.093
I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye.

00:22.368 --> 00:24.135
Passports from
3 different countries

00:24.203 --> 00:25.637
and a bank account in each one

00:25.704 --> 00:27.105
to keep you comfortable.

00:27.173 --> 00:28.173
Thank you.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.108
Good luck.

00:34.747 --> 00:36.815
Penelope, you gotta stop
staring at her.

00:36.882 --> 00:38.116
I can't help it.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

00:48.227 --> 00:50.995
So I came in here to do what?

00:51.063 --> 00:53.398
Talk about losing Emily?

00:56.068 --> 00:57.702
Strauss put you up to this?

00:57.770 --> 01:00.939
The assessment's routine.

01:01.006 --> 01:03.074
I asked her to let me do it

01:03.142 --> 01:07.178
rather than bring in
somebody from the outside.

01:07.246 --> 01:10.081
So let me guess... it's about
the 5 stages of grief.

01:10.149 --> 01:13.718
You want to figure out
where we all are. Hmm?

01:16.822 --> 01:19.224
All right.

01:19.291 --> 01:22.660
Denial. I'm fine, this
can't be happening to me.

01:22.728 --> 01:24.529
Well, it didn't
happen to me, did it?

01:24.597 --> 01:26.197
So that rules that out.

01:26.265 --> 01:28.666
What else is there?

01:28.734 --> 01:31.035
Bargaining.

01:31.103 --> 01:33.338
Depression.

01:35.241 --> 01:38.376
Acceptance.

01:38.444 --> 01:40.378
Well, obviously
I haven't accepted it,

01:40.446 --> 01:42.947
otherwise I wouldn't be
in here.

01:43.015 --> 01:44.382
So where does that leave me?

01:44.450 --> 01:46.518
Angry.

01:48.020 --> 01:49.988
Angry.

01:51.457 --> 01:53.057
Yeah.

01:53.125 --> 01:55.560
Yeah, sometimes I feel
like I want to quit my job

01:55.628 --> 01:58.229
and spend my time chasing down the
son of a bitch who killed Emily.

01:58.297 --> 02:00.165
You're damn right I'm angry.

02:01.800 --> 02:04.002
Please...No,
you gotta let me go.

02:04.069 --> 02:05.436
Let me out of here, please.

02:05.504 --> 02:07.539
Please let me go!
Why aren't you listening to me?

02:07.606 --> 02:10.074
Why aren't you listening to me?

02:10.142 --> 02:12.043
I need you to try
and stay still.

02:12.111 --> 02:13.378
Can I get someone
over here to help me?

02:13.445 --> 02:16.514
Hold down her legs.
I need a full injection of...

02:16.582 --> 02:19.517
I need you to try
and take a deep breath.

02:19.585 --> 02:22.487
No! No!

04:07.826 --> 04:09.093
Hi, how's it goin'?

04:09.161 --> 04:11.062
Hi.

04:11.130 --> 04:12.730
I'd like to buy a gun.

04:12.798 --> 04:14.465
What are you looking for?

04:14.533 --> 04:16.868
A .38?

04:16.935 --> 04:18.435
Um, the kind that spins.

04:18.504 --> 04:19.570
Yeah.
A revolver.

04:19.637 --> 04:20.637
Ok.

04:25.711 --> 04:28.513
This one here produces
little recoil.

04:28.580 --> 04:31.316
Good for target-shooting
and personal defense.

04:31.383 --> 04:33.484
Here, check it out.

04:38.123 --> 04:39.490
I'll take it.

04:39.558 --> 04:41.159
Ok.

04:41.226 --> 04:42.460
Do you have a gun license?

04:42.528 --> 04:44.362
No.

04:44.430 --> 04:46.497
Well, how about a permit?

04:46.565 --> 04:49.734
You know, there's a mandatory
3-day waiting period

04:49.802 --> 04:52.403
on all handgun purchases.

04:52.471 --> 04:53.705
3 days?

04:53.772 --> 04:55.039
State law.

04:55.107 --> 04:56.674
Here.

04:56.742 --> 04:59.510
Fill this out,

04:59.578 --> 05:01.279
and I'll be back
in a few minutes.

05:01.347 --> 05:02.613
Ok?

05:03.982 --> 05:06.417
Hi, how you doing?

05:06.485 --> 05:08.653
Yeah, I have that.

05:28.173 --> 05:31.743
No, it's got
a good sweep. Back up.

05:44.256 --> 05:46.257
What are you doing?

05:46.325 --> 05:47.658
Hey!

05:51.530 --> 05:54.332
A deadly chain of events
to report to you today.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.134
Approximately 45 minutes ago,

05:56.201 --> 05:58.136
4 people were shot to death

05:58.203 --> 06:01.172
in a gun shop
on West Waters street.

06:01.240 --> 06:05.176
Tampa PD Are calling
this mass murder unprecedented.

06:05.244 --> 06:07.378
A woman went in there
and just shot up the place?

06:07.446 --> 06:08.679
Yeah, witnesses heard gunshots

06:08.747 --> 06:10.248
and saw a woman
leaving the store.

06:10.315 --> 06:11.449
Is there enough for a sketch?

06:11.517 --> 06:13.017
Family-owned business.
No cameras.

06:13.085 --> 06:14.685
The only thing of value
the witnesses said

06:14.753 --> 06:16.020
was that she seemed
really calm.

06:16.088 --> 06:17.855
Like an office
or school shooter.

06:17.923 --> 06:19.157
Did she work there?

06:19.224 --> 06:20.758
No. Local police have
already ruled that out.

06:20.826 --> 06:22.293
Then she must have known
one of her victims.

06:22.361 --> 06:23.694
I doubt this was random.

06:23.762 --> 06:25.530
You know, Klebold and Harris
documented their hatred

06:25.597 --> 06:26.664
of the athletes at columbine,

06:26.732 --> 06:28.800
but on the day,
they targeted the cafeteria

06:28.867 --> 06:31.135
instead of the gymnasium because
they were only interested

06:31.203 --> 06:33.504
in obtaining the highest
possible body count.

06:33.572 --> 06:34.839
These offenders usually hole up

06:34.907 --> 06:36.641
in one location and
eventually commit suicide,

06:36.708 --> 06:37.809
either by their own hand

06:37.876 --> 06:39.143
or in a shootout with police.

06:39.211 --> 06:41.512
But this woman took off
before the cops arrived.

06:41.580 --> 06:42.947
She's probably not finished.

07:13.603 --> 07:17.423
Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

07:39.381 --> 07:40.581
I get it. We're a family,
and it's important

07:40.648 --> 07:42.249
that families talk, and
holding it in will just make

07:42.317 --> 07:45.586
this sick, sad feeling
of awfulness more awful.

07:45.653 --> 07:46.820
Right?

07:46.888 --> 07:50.290
Internalizing
does make it worse.

07:50.358 --> 07:54.395
I'll talk, but I don't want
to talk about her being gone.

07:54.462 --> 07:57.364
Can I talk about
how she made me smile?

07:57.432 --> 07:59.733
Of course.

07:59.801 --> 08:00.801
Ok.

08:02.537 --> 08:04.905
Poet Antonio Porchia wrote,

08:04.973 --> 08:07.408
"man, when he does not grieve,

08:07.475 --> 08:08.976
hardly exists."

08:09.043 --> 08:10.944
Larry Connors,
born and raised in Tampa.

08:11.012 --> 08:13.414
He's owned the gun store
for 16 years.

08:13.481 --> 08:14.982
Seaver, what did you
find out about victimology?

08:15.049 --> 08:16.984
They're all locals
with similar backgrounds.

08:17.051 --> 08:18.585
Blue collar jobs,
they're all divorced,

08:18.653 --> 08:20.087
and they've all got tempers.

08:20.155 --> 08:22.189
Most of them have misdemeanor
bar fights on their record.

08:22.257 --> 08:23.891
Testosterone-fueled victims,

08:23.992 --> 08:26.160
but somehow she still gets
the drop on all of them.

08:26.227 --> 08:28.028
Men like this may not
view her as a threat

08:28.096 --> 08:29.463
because she's a woman.

08:29.531 --> 08:31.231
Who's likely in the middle
of a psychotic break.

08:31.299 --> 08:32.533
We should check
psych wards in the area

08:32.600 --> 08:33.667
for recent releases.

08:33.735 --> 08:35.501
And run incident reports
on women

08:35.570 --> 08:37.037
who've been asked to leave
businesses

08:37.105 --> 08:38.572
due to angry outbursts.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.506
How far do we want
to go back? A year?

08:40.575 --> 08:41.674
No, more than that.

08:41.743 --> 08:42.842
No incident is too small.

08:42.910 --> 08:45.179
She's probably been boiling
for a while.

08:45.246 --> 08:47.147
Unless she's in serious
denial, then she's been

08:47.215 --> 08:50.083
burying her feelings, which would
have just made her worse and worse.

08:50.151 --> 08:51.952
The question is,
why did she choose today?

08:55.990 --> 08:57.724
Hi, this is Don.
Leave a message

08:57.792 --> 08:59.560
and I'll call you back
as soon as possible.

09:00.628 --> 09:01.895
I called you at the station

09:01.963 --> 09:04.231
and, um, they said that
you weren't there.

09:04.299 --> 09:05.566
And you're not here.

09:05.633 --> 09:07.935
And I still can't believe
you changed your cell.

09:08.002 --> 09:10.103
Am I that much of a burden?

09:14.008 --> 09:19.246
Don, I... I need
to talk to you, today.

09:19.314 --> 09:23.250
Will you... will you
meet me at the mall?

09:23.318 --> 09:24.852
Please?

09:36.631 --> 09:39.266
Chief Thiers.
Thanks for coming.

09:39.334 --> 09:40.267
Agent Rossi.

09:40.335 --> 09:41.735
This is agent Hotchner.

09:41.803 --> 09:43.103
Good morning.
Good morning.

09:43.171 --> 09:45.772
The store was only open a few
minutes when this went down.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.541
Hell of a way to start the day.

09:49.410 --> 09:52.346
Kept the bodies here long past
their expiration date.

09:52.413 --> 09:55.382
Trying to help us figure out
what the hell went on in here.

09:55.450 --> 09:57.551
It would appear 4 shots fired

09:57.619 --> 09:59.419
from generally this position.

09:59.487 --> 10:00.954
4 dead.

10:01.055 --> 10:02.389
Proficient.

10:02.457 --> 10:03.957
She comes in with a gun

10:04.025 --> 10:05.459
and she gets all the way
to the counter

10:05.527 --> 10:07.828
without attracting attention?

10:07.896 --> 10:09.997
Was this case unlocked
when you got here?

10:10.064 --> 10:11.632
We haven't touched a thing.

10:11.699 --> 10:14.635
There seems to be a .38
revolver missing.

10:14.702 --> 10:16.570
And 2 .38 rounds
on the floor

10:16.638 --> 10:18.805
and all the ammo
is still locked up.

10:18.873 --> 10:20.807
She brought bullets from
home and came in unarmed?

10:20.875 --> 10:23.076
Access to the ammo
but not the weapon.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.612
So, she knew what gun
to ask for.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.581
So she comes to the counter,
asks for the .38,

10:27.649 --> 10:29.082
he gives her
a permit application.

10:29.150 --> 10:31.118
Which she doesn't fill out.

10:31.185 --> 10:33.253
But there's a 3-day
waiting period.

10:33.321 --> 10:34.421
Maybe she's got a record,

10:34.489 --> 10:36.089
knows she won't pass
the background.

10:36.157 --> 10:38.525
Or there's something about
today and she can't wait.

10:38.593 --> 10:41.161
So she discreetly loads it,
goes to leave,

10:41.229 --> 10:42.930
they stop her...

10:42.997 --> 10:45.098
Not realizing it's loaded.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.700
But if it's just
a gun she wants,

10:46.768 --> 10:48.969
why kill all these guys?

10:49.037 --> 10:50.737
They were in the way.

11:13.094 --> 11:16.129
This woman had access
to ammo for a .38,

11:16.197 --> 11:17.297
but not a gun.

11:17.365 --> 11:18.699
She most likely lives
with someone

11:18.766 --> 11:20.801
who's into guns but
doesn't allow her access.

11:20.868 --> 11:23.036
Usually locking weapons
is a way to protect children,

11:23.104 --> 11:25.672
but to keep a key from her is a
controlling and dominating act.

11:25.740 --> 11:27.474
She could be in
an abusive relationship

11:27.542 --> 11:29.843
and today's the day
she had enough.

11:29.911 --> 11:31.545
She stole the gun
at 9:00 this morning.

11:31.613 --> 11:33.046
If she needed it
to go after somebody,

11:33.114 --> 11:34.414
why hasn't she done it yet?

11:34.482 --> 11:36.216
Maybe she was them hostage
right now and is working up

11:36.284 --> 11:37.584
the courage to end it all.

11:37.652 --> 11:39.219
Or maybe her target
knows her personally

11:39.287 --> 11:41.254
and isn't letting her get
close enough for a kill.

11:41.322 --> 11:43.790
And she's setting a trap
and waiting.

11:50.431 --> 11:53.200
Mommy!

11:53.267 --> 11:54.901
Are you ok?

11:54.969 --> 11:57.604
What happened?

11:57.672 --> 11:59.573
Did you hurt yourself?

11:59.641 --> 12:01.942
Did you hurt your knee?

12:03.011 --> 12:04.444
Here, I'll help you.

12:04.512 --> 12:05.946
I'll help you.
Come here. There you go.

12:06.014 --> 12:07.748
Is this your son?

12:07.815 --> 12:10.550
What? Yeah, he...
he needs my help.

12:10.618 --> 12:11.752
What?
Are you his mother?

12:11.819 --> 12:13.286
No, I mean, he's hurt.
Can't you see that?

12:13.354 --> 12:14.554
Son, where's your mom?

12:14.622 --> 12:18.025
I'll take it from here,
ma'am. Let go.

12:22.430 --> 12:23.597
You gotta help him.

12:23.665 --> 12:25.632
Do something. Do something.
You gotta do something.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.968
You see right there?
You gotta do something.

12:28.036 --> 12:29.369
You gotta do something.

12:29.437 --> 12:31.805
Don't... don't take him.
Please.

12:31.873 --> 12:34.241
Please, he needs my help.

12:34.308 --> 12:35.609
Ma'am, I'm gonna
need you to leave.

12:35.677 --> 12:37.244
No... no, but he needs me.

12:37.311 --> 12:38.779
I'm not gonna ask you again.

12:38.846 --> 12:40.480
No, you don't understand.
I mean, he's... he's...

12:40.548 --> 12:42.616
all right, ma'am,
let's go. Let's go.

12:42.684 --> 12:44.251
Let's go!
No.

12:44.318 --> 12:45.986
No! He needs me.

12:46.054 --> 12:47.954
No, honestly, he needs me!

12:48.022 --> 12:49.389
Let's go, ma'am.

12:55.229 --> 12:57.064
Garcia, based on victimology,

12:57.131 --> 12:58.699
the unsub's husband
or boyfriend

12:58.766 --> 12:59.866
most likely owns a .38.

12:59.934 --> 13:01.034
We need you to search
for white males

13:01.102 --> 13:03.403
age 35 to 50 who have
registered that model.

13:03.471 --> 13:06.139
We think he might be
law enforcement or military.

13:06.207 --> 13:08.642
It's possible the unsub
was in an abusive relationship

13:08.710 --> 13:10.444
that contributed
to her breakdown, Garcia.

13:10.511 --> 13:12.479
So look for crossover with
reports of domestic abuse.

13:12.547 --> 13:15.749
This is tricky. Do you have
anything else to narrow it down?

13:15.817 --> 13:17.150
Why?

13:17.218 --> 13:18.785
Because Florida's
a stand-your-ground state.

13:18.853 --> 13:21.221
Castle doctrine based on English
common law that allows homeowners

13:21.289 --> 13:23.190
to use deadly force
to protect their land.

13:23.257 --> 13:25.992
Yeah, it's a high-falutin
way of saying that the gun laws

13:26.060 --> 13:29.029
are lax at best.
After the 2008 elections,

13:29.097 --> 13:31.898
the floridians were nervous about
losing their second amendment rights

13:31.966 --> 13:33.600
and gun sales
shot through the roof,

13:33.668 --> 13:34.935
pun intended.

13:35.002 --> 13:37.037
How many of those men
fit that profile in Tampa?

13:37.105 --> 13:39.706
As it stand right now, 638.

13:41.709 --> 13:43.276
There's been another shooting.

13:46.214 --> 13:47.647
The media's gonna
run with this.

13:47.715 --> 13:49.816
We need to talk to the
press as soon as possible.

13:49.884 --> 13:52.819
And do what? Just confirm we
have an armed woman on the loose

13:52.887 --> 13:54.254
and we can't find her?

13:54.322 --> 13:57.424
Yes. And to let people know
that they need to be vigilant.

13:57.492 --> 13:59.693
Paul lyons, security guard.

13:59.761 --> 14:00.727
- No.
- Was he armed?

14:00.795 --> 14:03.063
You saw video?
And all we have

14:03.131 --> 14:04.364
are the overhead cameras?

14:04.432 --> 14:05.932
Yes, and they're scattered.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.002
Best we got from the video is a
woman with short brown hair.

14:09.070 --> 14:10.771
And she was sitting here.

14:10.838 --> 14:12.105
Right.

14:12.173 --> 14:15.909
It looks like she was waiting
for someone that never showed.

14:15.977 --> 14:18.011
And instead, she takes out
her rage on the guard,

14:18.079 --> 14:19.412
in front of the children.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.848
As he escorted her
out of the building.

14:21.916 --> 14:23.350
Still, that's pretty controlled

14:23.417 --> 14:25.252
not to turn on anyone else.

14:25.319 --> 14:28.221
That's true. She could have easily
taken out more people and she didn't.

14:28.289 --> 14:29.890
He was the person
that got in her way.

14:29.957 --> 14:32.559
She's not ready to confront
the source of her rage yet.

14:32.627 --> 14:33.994
Yet?

14:34.061 --> 14:35.395
Until she is,

14:35.463 --> 14:37.731
this will probably
happen again.

14:53.981 --> 14:55.382
Get down on the ground!

14:55.449 --> 14:57.350
Help.

15:01.189 --> 15:03.456
Ma'am, please pull forward.

15:04.659 --> 15:05.926
Please help me.

15:05.993 --> 15:06.927
All right, ma'am,
please don't move.

15:06.994 --> 15:08.328
Will you help him?

15:10.665 --> 15:11.765
Help who?

15:11.833 --> 15:13.099
You gotta get him.
You gotta get my son.

15:13.167 --> 15:14.534
Another ambulance
is on the way.

15:14.602 --> 15:16.069
No, somebody take him.
I can't get him.

15:16.137 --> 15:17.571
Another ambulance
is on the way.

15:17.638 --> 15:19.940
Ok. Ok. Wait.

15:20.007 --> 15:21.274
No, no, no.

15:21.342 --> 15:23.376
No, where are you going?

15:23.444 --> 15:24.878
Damion?

15:25.947 --> 15:29.316
Damion...

15:29.383 --> 15:31.985
My God, why won't you help him?

15:32.053 --> 15:36.089
Why won't you help him?

15:36.157 --> 15:38.825
Ma'am, will you please
step out of the vehicle?

15:53.455 --> 15:55.322
The last time I was on
a couch like this

15:55.390 --> 15:56.957
was when my father left.

15:57.025 --> 15:59.226
They all thought
I needed to talk,

15:59.294 --> 16:01.962
but developmentally I wasn't
guided by conscience.

16:02.030 --> 16:04.331
I could only reveal what
my mother and teachers

16:04.399 --> 16:06.600
told me was acceptable.

16:06.668 --> 16:09.837
You told them exactly when you
knew they wanted to hear.

16:09.904 --> 16:12.840
You don't have to do that here.

16:15.176 --> 16:18.646
It's just unfair
that she's gone.

16:18.713 --> 16:20.981
It's like if we can't
keep each other safe,

16:21.049 --> 16:24.051
then why are we even
doing any of this?

16:28.556 --> 16:31.625
It's...Sometimes
I think maybe...

16:31.693 --> 16:35.262
maybe gideon was right,
you know, maybe...

16:35.330 --> 16:37.598
Maybe it's just not worth it.

16:47.275 --> 16:49.343
The officer is in
critical condition.

16:49.411 --> 16:51.245
Anybody get a plate?

16:51.313 --> 16:52.346
No, just a partial description.

16:52.414 --> 16:54.048
Teal green wagon.

16:54.115 --> 16:55.449
Garcia...

16:55.517 --> 16:57.885
This woman opens fire
in broad daylight

16:57.952 --> 16:59.386
at a police checkpoint.

16:59.454 --> 17:01.789
She's desperate.
This was an act of survival.

17:01.856 --> 17:03.057
Where does this road lead?

17:03.124 --> 17:04.724
I-275.

17:04.792 --> 17:06.960
Florida highway patrol
has traffic cams

17:07.028 --> 17:09.296
all the way to St. Pete.
She won't get far.

17:09.364 --> 17:11.865
Two EMTs just got shot
in Oakford park.

17:11.933 --> 17:12.965
Where's that?

17:13.034 --> 17:15.469
It's the opposite direction.

17:15.537 --> 17:16.704
She went back?

17:16.771 --> 17:18.771
She's on a mission.

17:18.839 --> 17:22.242
Address the grace period...

17:27.715 --> 17:29.883
Looking good, buddy.
Even higher.

17:29.951 --> 17:32.219
Oh, honey, that's too close.

17:32.287 --> 17:33.721
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, you look beautiful.

17:33.788 --> 17:34.788
Just smile.
No.

17:34.856 --> 17:36.423
Damion, come here.
Save me.

17:36.491 --> 17:37.591
Get her to smile.

17:37.659 --> 17:39.259
Smile, mama. Smile.

17:39.327 --> 17:40.661
Yeah, smile, mommy.

17:40.729 --> 17:42.096
Ok, you smile with me.
I'll smile for you.

17:42.163 --> 17:44.798
Dad, he needs to just back
up a little bit.

17:46.067 --> 17:47.000
Yeah...

17:48.570 --> 17:50.337
Now I'm gonna get you.

18:00.682 --> 18:03.117
Her emotional turmoil
appears to be manifesting

18:03.184 --> 18:04.818
in the geographic pattern
of her spree.

18:04.886 --> 18:06.487
Meaning?

18:06.554 --> 18:07.788
There's a reason
she hasn't left.

18:07.856 --> 18:10.457
Her first was the gun store
in west Tampa,

18:10.558 --> 18:11.959
then the security guard
in Ybor city,

18:12.026 --> 18:14.027
then the officer at the
checkpoint in riverside heights,

18:14.095 --> 18:16.463
then finally the EMTs
in Oakford park.

18:16.531 --> 18:17.965
She's like a bouncing ball.

18:18.032 --> 18:19.466
There's no logic.
She circled back

18:19.534 --> 18:21.135
after getting through
a roadblock.

18:21.202 --> 18:23.203
She's driven purely by emotion.

18:23.271 --> 18:25.773
She doesn't care about
self-preservation or escape.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.208
It's like she has
nothing to live for.

18:28.276 --> 18:30.043
She may have suffered
a loss herself

18:30.111 --> 18:32.112
and she blaming someone for it.

18:32.180 --> 18:34.481
We're looking
for a white female

18:34.549 --> 18:36.116
between the ages of 30 and 40,

18:36.184 --> 18:38.652
driving a teal green
station wagon.

18:38.753 --> 18:41.121
But the only thing that
matters is her behavior.

18:41.189 --> 18:42.256
Which is random.

18:42.323 --> 18:43.590
She's all over the place.

18:43.658 --> 18:45.259
She could have escaped
through that roadblock,

18:45.326 --> 18:46.827
but she circled back instead.

18:46.895 --> 18:48.896
This tells us she's got
a score to settle.

18:48.963 --> 18:50.697
Here. Today.

18:50.765 --> 18:51.698
Like what?

18:51.766 --> 18:53.600
When emotional decisions
drive an unsub,

18:53.668 --> 18:55.202
it's usually connected
to an incredible loss,

18:55.270 --> 18:57.337
the idea that there's
nothing to live for.

18:57.405 --> 19:00.007
We believe that this woman's been through
the devastating loss of a child.

19:00.074 --> 19:02.676
She woke up this morning, loaded
up with bullets, and stole a gun.

19:02.744 --> 19:04.445
That is not
a typical Wednesday.

19:04.512 --> 19:05.879
Today means something to her.

19:05.947 --> 19:08.582
She's been lashing out
at the hero, and we believe

19:08.650 --> 19:10.284
that's because she feels
deeply betrayed

19:10.351 --> 19:11.618
by one who let her down.

19:11.686 --> 19:13.287
The fact that her anger
seems to be focused

19:13.354 --> 19:17.157
on first responders instead of
hospital personnel or doctors

19:17.225 --> 19:19.893
indicates that her child probably
didn't die of natural causes.

19:19.961 --> 19:22.296
Most likely it was
some kind of accident.

19:22.363 --> 19:24.031
And if that's so, she believes

19:24.098 --> 19:26.200
he should have been saved
but wasn't.

19:26.267 --> 19:29.203
Rage like this has been built
up over time, possibly years.

19:29.270 --> 19:30.637
And it's debilitating.

19:30.705 --> 19:32.506
She probably hasn't been
a functioning member of society

19:32.574 --> 19:33.907
since the loss of her child.

19:33.975 --> 19:36.877
This rampage was her final
attempt to be heard.

19:36.945 --> 19:39.680
What she started...
Ends today.

19:48.990 --> 19:51.658
You mind if I sit here?

19:51.726 --> 19:53.827
Hey.

19:55.730 --> 19:58.365
Hey, we've met before.

19:58.433 --> 20:00.968
Mommy and me at the rec, right?

20:01.035 --> 20:04.404
Oh, gosh, it's... it must
have been a few years ago,

20:04.472 --> 20:06.173
before the kids hit preschool.

20:07.775 --> 20:09.643
Where's your son?

20:09.711 --> 20:12.579
I'm sorry, wh-what?

20:12.647 --> 20:15.482
Well, ours were just a few
months apart, weren't they?

20:15.550 --> 20:18.385
Mine's over there.

20:18.453 --> 20:20.487
He's gonna be as tall
as me soon.

20:20.555 --> 20:23.123
It goes so fast, doesn't it?

20:23.191 --> 20:25.926
I swear, it has been
the longest and the shortest

20:25.994 --> 20:29.997
6 years of my life.

20:38.039 --> 20:40.007
Police say
this dangerous suspect

20:40.074 --> 20:42.409
has left a trail of blood
behind her.

20:42.477 --> 20:45.178
After wounding an officer
at a roadblock,

20:45.246 --> 20:48.115
she circled back and fired
at two paramedics.

20:48.182 --> 20:51.451
Luckily she missed,
keeping her body count at 5.

20:51.519 --> 20:53.353
A source inside the Tampa PD

20:53.421 --> 20:55.756
Told us FBI profilers
have been brought in...

20:55.823 --> 20:58.492
We need to try to communicate
with this woman directly.

20:58.560 --> 21:01.795
But she's not talking,
she's shooting.

21:01.863 --> 21:03.030
She feels ignored.

21:03.097 --> 21:04.998
The media is
sensationalizing the story.

21:05.066 --> 21:07.467
She'll continue to respond
violently to regain control.

21:07.535 --> 21:09.169
She shot a cop.

21:09.237 --> 21:12.005
The men she's targeted
are my responsibility.

21:12.073 --> 21:14.908
You asked for our help.
Let us do our job.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.681
Inclement
weather continues hot and humid

21:20.748 --> 21:22.382
for the remainder of the week.

21:22.450 --> 21:25.218
We have an 80% chance of a
thunderstorm coming in tonight

21:25.286 --> 21:26.553
with possible rainfall.

21:26.621 --> 21:29.323
That could be a major relief
for local residents.

21:29.390 --> 21:32.326
We have a special alert coming
in from the Tampa police.

21:32.393 --> 21:36.330
The FBI is preparing to
make a statement right now.

21:36.397 --> 21:38.198
This is Aaron Hotchner
with the FBI.

21:38.266 --> 21:39.800
Our team has come
from Quantico, Virginia,

21:39.867 --> 21:41.335
because we want to talk to you.

21:41.402 --> 21:43.003
We know that you have
a personal message

21:43.071 --> 21:44.471
that you need to share
with the world.

21:44.539 --> 21:46.173
All we ask is that
you stop hurting people,

21:46.240 --> 21:47.975
because we are listening.

21:48.042 --> 21:49.643
We know you've been hurt

21:49.711 --> 21:52.379
and you've suffered
a terrible loss,

21:52.447 --> 21:54.815
and we want to talk
to you about it.

21:54.882 --> 21:56.750
We want to know
how we can help.

21:56.818 --> 21:58.018
We've taken the first step.

21:58.086 --> 21:59.720
Now it's up to you.

21:59.787 --> 22:03.023
You can contact me
at 1-800-555-0140.

22:03.091 --> 22:05.926
Again, that number is... Aren't we gonna
get flooded by people calling that number?

22:05.994 --> 22:07.661
I am hawkeyeing the cell towers

22:07.729 --> 22:08.996
in her comfort zone.

22:09.063 --> 22:12.332
If anyone calls from there,
I will know first and fast.

22:36.190 --> 22:37.624
I called you at the station,

22:37.692 --> 22:40.293
and, um, they said that you
weren't... you weren't there.

22:40.361 --> 22:43.997
And you're not here. And I still
can't believe you changed your cell.

22:44.065 --> 22:46.700
Am I that much of a burden?

22:46.768 --> 22:50.270
Don, I... I need to talk
to you, today.

22:50.338 --> 22:53.373
Will you... will you
meet me at the mall?

22:53.441 --> 22:54.808
Please?

23:00.281 --> 23:02.482
Hi, Don.

23:12.477 --> 23:17.414
There are benefits
to meeting after hours.

23:17.482 --> 23:20.984
You know everyone's feeling it and
nobody wants to talk about it.

23:21.052 --> 23:24.855
It's too soon, Aaron.

23:24.922 --> 23:28.358
You know that better
than anyone.

23:28.426 --> 23:33.196
And, uh, doesn't Strauss
usually run these assessments?

23:33.264 --> 23:35.165
There was no way
that was gonna happen.

23:35.233 --> 23:38.268
Yeah, I didn't think so.

23:39.937 --> 23:43.640
And I also know
that you grieve privately.

23:45.943 --> 23:48.044
But you've been through
more than any of us

23:48.112 --> 23:49.413
in a very short time.

23:49.480 --> 23:51.081
How are you holding up?

23:51.149 --> 23:52.749
I'm all right.

23:55.787 --> 23:58.021
I think it's
an ongoing process.

24:01.559 --> 24:03.360
This is not my assessment.

24:03.428 --> 24:06.830
I'm supposed to be asking
how you're doing.

24:09.967 --> 24:12.769
I've always had trouble
letting people in.

24:16.507 --> 24:19.176
But this is different.

24:21.679 --> 24:26.683
I guess I've come to realize...

24:26.751 --> 24:29.352
I'm more married to this team

24:29.420 --> 24:32.322
than I ever was to 3 ex-wives.

24:37.595 --> 24:40.464
It's been a hard year.

24:40.531 --> 24:42.332
We'll get through it.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.335
Yeah. We will.

24:47.004 --> 24:48.939
Emily and Haley.

25:00.618 --> 25:03.553
You're supposed to stay
100 yards away from me.

25:03.621 --> 25:06.289
Please, don't give me the
letter of the law right now.

25:06.357 --> 25:08.358
Then don't give me this.

25:09.494 --> 25:11.828
Why are you carrying
that around?

25:13.798 --> 25:15.665
I just need to feel better.

25:15.733 --> 25:17.300
And that concerns me how?

25:22.773 --> 25:24.508
They don't remember.

25:24.575 --> 25:27.377
No one remembers.

25:29.580 --> 25:34.084
Don, I just need to talk.

25:41.392 --> 25:43.326
Ok.

25:44.328 --> 25:45.495
Ok.

25:47.598 --> 25:51.001
No leads on the hotline
and no sign of her vehicle.

25:51.068 --> 25:53.303
This woman obviously
has a plan.

25:53.371 --> 25:55.639
The only clear decision
she made this morning

25:55.706 --> 25:57.040
was walking into
that gun store.

25:57.108 --> 26:00.210
There are 8 of them in her comfort zone.
Why choose that one?

26:00.278 --> 26:02.779
Convenience.
Maybe it's close to where she lives.

26:02.847 --> 26:05.549
If we're saying this morning is
when she was the most clear-headed,

26:05.616 --> 26:09.586
then it was a conscious decision to
walk into that particular store.

26:18.629 --> 26:21.031
I mean, do you have
anything of his?

26:21.098 --> 26:23.333
I mean, not even a painting.

26:23.401 --> 26:24.834
Nothing.

26:24.902 --> 26:26.803
You came all the way
over here for this?

26:26.871 --> 26:30.173
You're just like
everybody else.

26:30.241 --> 26:33.743
And you'd rather forget him than
admit you couldn't save him.

26:37.582 --> 26:39.849
I choose to remember
the good times.

26:39.917 --> 26:43.053
Well, I don't have that luxury.

26:43.120 --> 26:45.789
I have hundreds of teal wagons.

26:45.856 --> 26:48.725
None of the registrations match the
physical description of our unsub.

26:48.793 --> 26:50.427
What about the gun store?

26:50.494 --> 26:52.095
Mm. And then there's that.

26:52.163 --> 26:54.564
I searched the entire history
of Larry's gun shop.

26:54.632 --> 26:57.033
Nothing of significance
has ever happened there

26:57.101 --> 26:58.868
aside from this
morning's massacre.

26:58.970 --> 27:02.038
And on top of that, you know those
600-plus registered .38 owners?

27:02.106 --> 27:03.940
They bought them
all over the city,

27:04.008 --> 27:06.710
so we're pretty much screwed unless you can
think of some other kind of connection.

27:06.777 --> 27:09.412
Then the date only
means something to her.

27:09.480 --> 27:10.647
Garcia, we profiled that
it was a major loss.

27:10.715 --> 27:13.083
Run accident reports.
Look for young victims.

27:13.150 --> 27:15.051
She seems to be going
after heroes.

27:15.119 --> 27:16.620
Ok, you guys,
I'm doing that now,

27:16.687 --> 27:18.655
but this will take forever.

27:18.723 --> 27:21.725
Tampa's got almost
half a million people.

27:21.792 --> 27:25.028
Everybody's got a story.
How am I even supposed to...

27:26.497 --> 27:28.098
Yeah.
Oh?

27:28.165 --> 27:30.900
My superskills
just squelched my pessimism.

27:30.968 --> 27:32.335
I have a couple
of accidents here

27:32.403 --> 27:34.037
that happened
in the last few years

27:34.105 --> 27:35.872
on or around today's date.

27:35.940 --> 27:38.041
Please hold while I deduce.

27:38.109 --> 27:39.609
This looks promising.

27:39.677 --> 27:43.947
Ok, there was a high-speed traffic
chase in west Tampa last year.

27:44.015 --> 27:45.248
A policeman was killed.

27:45.316 --> 27:46.282
Who were they chasing?

27:46.350 --> 27:48.752
Uh, Hanley Waters.

27:48.819 --> 27:49.953
Maybe he's the target.

27:50.021 --> 27:51.087
No. He's in jail.

27:51.155 --> 27:52.489
He started a whole mess

27:52.556 --> 27:55.825
because he decided to do
an armed robbery

27:55.893 --> 28:00.063
at a liquor store and then have a
high-speed car chase with the cops.

28:00.131 --> 28:01.931
Oh, there's video.

28:01.999 --> 28:05.268
It's 365 days ago to the dot.

28:05.336 --> 28:07.003
I'm sending this
to your tablets.

28:07.071 --> 28:09.339
Observe and prepare yourself.

28:11.609 --> 28:14.110
Who is it who got hit?

28:14.178 --> 28:16.112
Tampa mom Shelly Chamberlain.

28:16.180 --> 28:18.014
She was unhurt.

28:18.082 --> 28:19.949
Her 6-year-old Damion died.

28:20.017 --> 28:21.818
That's her.

28:21.886 --> 28:25.055
Oh... and today is Damion's
birthday.

28:25.122 --> 28:28.324
Your son enters and leaves
your life on the same date.

28:28.392 --> 28:29.726
That's one hell of a stressor.

28:29.794 --> 28:31.895
It explains why she went
on her spree today.

28:31.962 --> 28:34.798
All the good and bad memories
are hitting her at once.

28:34.865 --> 28:36.533
And to add salt to it all,
the fallen policeman

28:36.600 --> 28:38.835
was the only one
who got any attention.

28:38.903 --> 28:40.704
Damion was like a footnote.

28:40.771 --> 28:42.505
If Shelly Chamberlain
is our unsub

28:42.606 --> 28:44.174
and the man who caused
this is in jail,

28:44.241 --> 28:46.042
then who's her target?

28:57.788 --> 29:00.523
I didn't come here to fight.

29:00.591 --> 29:02.559
Especially not today.

29:02.626 --> 29:05.562
Well, that's the only way
we know how to communicate.

29:05.629 --> 29:08.498
Will you come celebrate
Damion's birthday with me?

29:08.566 --> 29:11.067
Let's go to his favorite place.

29:11.135 --> 29:12.168
Shelly...

29:12.236 --> 29:14.537
What? It wouldn't
kill you to go.

29:14.605 --> 29:17.273
I don't think
that's a good idea.

29:17.341 --> 29:19.509
Why has it always been
so hard for you

29:19.577 --> 29:21.077
to give me what I want?

29:22.346 --> 29:25.215
I mean, you weren't there
for his birthday.

29:25.282 --> 29:26.716
I tried, Shelly.
You know I tried.

29:26.784 --> 29:29.285
You refused to stay with me
after he died.

29:29.353 --> 29:31.421
That's not true.

29:31.489 --> 29:33.957
And now here you are
again saying no.

29:40.498 --> 29:43.099
Just this last time.

29:43.167 --> 29:45.835
I mean...
That's all I'm asking.

29:48.139 --> 29:50.707
Garcia, what's Shelly's
marital status?

29:50.775 --> 29:53.643
Don Chamberlain,
city firefighter.

29:53.711 --> 29:55.044
He filed for divorce
3 months ago.

29:55.079 --> 29:58.281
A local hero, like some
of the others she shot.

29:58.349 --> 30:00.817
But the pain of losing a child
destroyed the marriage.

30:00.885 --> 30:02.252
He could be the next target
of her rage,

30:02.319 --> 30:04.988
the man who didn't bear
witness to her grief.

30:05.055 --> 30:08.124
Morgan, you find him.
Dave and I will go to Shelly's house.

30:12.496 --> 30:14.430
Clear!

30:14.498 --> 30:15.965
Clear!

30:16.033 --> 30:17.300
Clear!

30:17.368 --> 30:18.301
Clear.

30:18.369 --> 30:20.170
Shelly's car is still here.

30:20.237 --> 30:22.238
And don's is gone.
Which means she beat us here

30:22.306 --> 30:23.740
and she moved him in his car.

30:23.808 --> 30:25.041
But why didn't she
just kill him?

30:25.109 --> 30:27.010
She didn't travel with any
of her other victims.

30:27.077 --> 30:29.112
He must play some part
in the fantasy of her rage.

30:29.180 --> 30:30.580
She wants to punish him
for something.

30:30.648 --> 30:33.249
The bullets were here.

30:33.317 --> 30:36.753
But Don took the gun
when he moved out.

30:36.821 --> 30:38.588
Dave?

30:41.125 --> 30:42.959
She broke mirrors
all over the house.

30:43.027 --> 30:45.395
She's disgusted with herself.

30:45.462 --> 30:48.064
She's built emotional walls...

30:48.132 --> 30:49.933
guilt, worthlessness,

30:50.000 --> 30:51.401
hopelessness.

30:51.468 --> 30:54.070
Then she decided she was
tired of waking up this way.

30:54.138 --> 30:56.840
Let me show you something else.

31:01.312 --> 31:04.547
His father was a fireman.

31:04.615 --> 31:06.416
His hero.

31:08.219 --> 31:10.653
Everything's perfect.

31:10.721 --> 31:13.356
Clearly,
she's enshrined her son.

31:13.424 --> 31:16.092
She couldn't let go.

31:22.766 --> 31:26.135
There's not a single reminder of
Damion anywhere in this house.

31:26.203 --> 31:27.871
Because Don had accepted it?

31:27.938 --> 31:30.640
It's only been a year.
What are the chances he's done grieving?

31:30.708 --> 31:33.376
Maybe that's why she's mad at
him and wants him to suffer.

31:33.444 --> 31:34.978
Hey, guys, look at this.

31:35.045 --> 31:37.146
Don edited it together
and he put music to it.

31:37.214 --> 31:39.816
This is how he grieved.

31:39.884 --> 31:41.351
Yeah, but she
wouldn't know that.

31:41.418 --> 31:43.620
She might force him to grieve
the same way she does.

31:43.687 --> 31:46.356
Where? Their son's grave?

31:46.423 --> 31:48.725
It looks like they celebrated their
son's third, fourth, and fifth birthday

31:48.792 --> 31:50.059
at sir burger.

31:50.127 --> 31:51.427
Her day is coming to an end,

31:51.495 --> 31:52.595
and today's an anniversary.

31:52.663 --> 31:54.664
That's gotta be
where she's going.

31:54.732 --> 31:57.600
Look at the camera.
Come on.

31:57.668 --> 32:00.403
Hi, daddy!

32:00.471 --> 32:03.873
Welcome to sir burger.
You folks know what you want?

32:03.941 --> 32:05.742
One birthday surprise, please.

32:05.809 --> 32:07.277
Outstanding.

32:07.344 --> 32:09.445
And where is
the birthday boy or girl?

32:11.115 --> 32:14.751
He, uh...Couldn't make it.

32:14.818 --> 32:17.453
Oh, sir, then
I can't give you that.

32:17.521 --> 32:19.923
It's reserved
for children, so...

32:19.990 --> 32:23.159
He always had
a birthday surprise.

32:23.227 --> 32:25.395
I want a birthday surprise.

32:25.462 --> 32:26.729
Ma'am, it's our policy.

32:26.797 --> 32:29.399
We, uh, can't give you that.

32:29.466 --> 32:31.200
For God sakes, Shel.

32:31.268 --> 32:32.235
We're here.
Isn't that enough?

32:32.303 --> 32:33.403
Just order something else.

32:33.470 --> 32:36.105
You know, you wouldn't be here

32:36.173 --> 32:37.941
if it wasn't for me.

32:38.008 --> 32:39.509
Shelly...

32:39.576 --> 32:43.279
Ok, uh, one birthday
surprise coming up.

32:43.347 --> 32:45.348
No, it's too late for that.

32:45.416 --> 32:46.382
What are you doing?

32:46.450 --> 32:47.784
You don't care.

32:47.851 --> 32:50.353
That is not true, Shel.

32:50.421 --> 32:52.989
There's not a second in the day

32:53.057 --> 32:57.393
when I don't think,
if I'd only been there,

32:57.461 --> 33:00.596
if I'd only taken a day off
of work for his birthday.

33:00.698 --> 33:02.065
But we have to move on.

33:02.132 --> 33:04.067
Shel, at some point
we have to move on.

33:04.134 --> 33:06.202
Will you stop saying that.

33:06.270 --> 33:08.304
We can't.

33:08.372 --> 33:12.408
How can we move on
without Damion?

33:29.383 --> 33:32.452
Hon, you see this?

33:32.520 --> 33:35.021
Look at you, sweetie.

33:36.724 --> 33:38.658
Hey, is it your birthday?

33:41.629 --> 33:43.329
Put it away, shel.

33:43.397 --> 33:45.131
Stay away from me.
Come on. Shelly...

33:45.199 --> 33:47.700
Shelly...
now I mean it, Don.

33:47.768 --> 33:49.369
Mama...

33:49.437 --> 33:50.770
Let's get out of here.

33:50.838 --> 33:53.840
You know, you, uh,

33:53.908 --> 33:55.175
you remind me of my son.

33:55.242 --> 33:56.843
We used to come here.

33:56.911 --> 33:58.812
He liked this place a lot.

33:58.879 --> 34:01.114
Please.

34:01.182 --> 34:02.749
What's going on?

34:02.817 --> 34:04.617
It's gonna be fine.

34:04.685 --> 34:05.785
We're leaving now.

34:05.853 --> 34:07.153
No.

34:07.221 --> 34:10.857
No, we're gonna stay
and we're gonna celebrate.

34:19.366 --> 34:21.400
How many people
we got in there?

34:21.469 --> 34:22.936
Not sure. 5 or 6.

34:23.003 --> 34:24.270
Manager got some out.

34:24.338 --> 34:25.605
I'm calling in SWAT.

34:25.672 --> 34:27.139
Don't do that.
If she feels pressured,

34:27.208 --> 34:28.274
she might snap.

34:28.342 --> 34:30.443
She hasn't done that already?

34:30.511 --> 34:32.245
If I get the shot,
I'm taking it.

34:32.313 --> 34:33.545
I'd like to try to talk to her.

34:33.614 --> 34:36.116
It's too late for that.
She's got hostages.

34:36.183 --> 34:38.118
She's probably
not aware of them.

34:38.185 --> 34:40.120
Well, I am. It's my job
to protect them.

34:40.187 --> 34:41.286
You don't have line of sight

34:41.355 --> 34:42.789
and a sniper round
could pass through her

34:42.857 --> 34:44.023
and into somebody else.

34:46.560 --> 34:48.460
Blow out the candles, sweetie.

34:48.529 --> 34:50.530
It's ok.

34:54.869 --> 34:57.337
Mm.

34:57.404 --> 34:58.938
Now cut a piece.

34:59.006 --> 35:00.306
Now that's enough.

35:00.374 --> 35:02.842
Leave him alone.

35:02.910 --> 35:04.677
No, he's gonna have
a piece of cake.

35:10.784 --> 35:11.851
Hello.

35:11.919 --> 35:13.987
This is Aaron Hotchner
with the FBI. Who is this?

35:14.054 --> 35:15.822
This is bill.

35:15.890 --> 35:17.223
I'm the manager.

35:17.291 --> 35:19.225
No.
Bill, is anyone hurt?

35:19.293 --> 35:20.727
Can you see the woman
with the gun?

35:20.794 --> 35:22.028
Yes.

35:22.096 --> 35:23.796
Can you get the phone to her?

35:23.864 --> 35:25.498
No, I can't go back over there.

35:25.566 --> 35:29.035
She's lost it.
I don't know what she's gonna do.

35:29.103 --> 35:30.970
I-I'm sorry.

35:31.038 --> 35:33.973
Ok. Stay where you are.
We'll get you out soon.

35:35.242 --> 35:37.210
He can't get the phone to her.
I'm gonna go in.

35:37.278 --> 35:38.444
You sure about this?

35:38.512 --> 35:39.646
She hasn't hurt anyone.

35:39.713 --> 35:41.247
This is about her family
and her grief.

35:41.315 --> 35:43.249
If she's at the end of her break
and nothing else matters,

35:43.317 --> 35:45.485
she could do anything, hotch.

35:45.553 --> 35:47.820
I'll keep my Mike open.

35:52.426 --> 35:55.895
Ok, he's done.
We can go now.

35:55.963 --> 35:58.231
He needs to open
his presents now.

35:58.299 --> 35:59.666
Come on, Shelly...
stay away from me.

35:59.733 --> 36:01.134
Shel...

36:01.202 --> 36:02.802
Shelly?
I'm serious.

36:07.074 --> 36:08.808
Who are you?

36:08.876 --> 36:10.577
My name is Aaron Hotchner.

36:10.644 --> 36:11.911
I'm with the FBI.

36:11.979 --> 36:13.413
And I know
it's Damion's birthday,

36:13.480 --> 36:17.550
and I just want to tell you how
sorry I am for what happened.

36:19.620 --> 36:21.521
What... what's going on?

36:21.589 --> 36:24.123
It's ok. He's here to help.

36:25.826 --> 36:28.494
No... nobody helps.

36:28.562 --> 36:30.196
You... you...

36:30.264 --> 36:32.532
you don't know a thing
about Damion.

36:32.600 --> 36:36.035
I know he was a happy
and confident little boy.

36:38.138 --> 36:40.807
H-how... how could you know that?

36:40.874 --> 36:42.742
I have a picture of him,

36:42.810 --> 36:45.578
standing next to you.
You're holding his hand and he's smiling.

36:45.646 --> 36:48.281
He's not...Hiding behind you
like some children do.

36:48.349 --> 36:51.985
It tells me that you encouraged him
and you gave him a lot of confidence.

36:54.021 --> 36:56.289
That picture,
it doesn't belong to you.

36:56.357 --> 36:58.725
I know. That's why I want
you to have it back.

36:58.792 --> 37:01.494
Wait... no... how did you...

37:01.562 --> 37:03.496
you turning 7 today, Sam?
Were you in my...

37:03.564 --> 37:05.331
that's not much older
than Damion.

37:05.399 --> 37:07.734
I know you don't want to scare
Sam, so they're gonna leave now.

37:07.801 --> 37:10.136
Bill, will you
show them out, please?

37:10.204 --> 37:11.838
No! What...
what are you doing?

37:11.905 --> 37:12.972
Go!
No... what's......

37:13.040 --> 37:14.073
what's going on?

37:14.141 --> 37:16.843
Don, I found this picture
of you and Damion.

37:16.910 --> 37:18.578
It's clear who his hero was.

37:18.646 --> 37:20.847
I know you blame yourself,
and you shouldn't.

37:20.914 --> 37:23.449
And, Shelly, all the hurt that
you might inflict on people

37:23.517 --> 37:25.518
is not gonna bring him back.

37:30.324 --> 37:35.295
They need to know
what they did.

37:35.362 --> 37:38.631
Believe me, everyone who
tried to save him that day

37:38.699 --> 37:39.732
isn't gonna forget.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.435
It's the day they failed.

37:42.503 --> 37:45.405
They'll ask themselves
what they could have done.

37:45.472 --> 37:46.639
Could they have
gotten here sooner?

37:46.707 --> 37:50.276
They'll heal,
but it's gonna take time.

37:50.344 --> 37:52.178
They'll move on,
but they won't forget.

37:59.853 --> 38:02.255
I could see that...

38:02.323 --> 38:03.790
that he was dying.

38:06.694 --> 38:10.296
And I tried
to help him. I tried.

38:10.364 --> 38:11.497
I tried.

38:11.565 --> 38:14.300
Please don't. Please.

38:14.368 --> 38:17.003
I said, honey,

38:17.071 --> 38:18.838
honey, it's gonna be all right.

38:18.906 --> 38:21.207
It's gonna be all right.
You hear those sirens?

38:21.275 --> 38:22.875
Do you hear those sirens?

38:22.943 --> 38:24.811
That is daddy,
and daddy is coming,

38:24.878 --> 38:26.412
and he's gonna...
he's gonna help us.

38:26.480 --> 38:27.914
He's gonna save us.

38:27.981 --> 38:31.084
But you never came.

38:31.151 --> 38:32.585
I know.

38:32.653 --> 38:34.687
I know, Shelly,
and I'm so sorry.

38:34.755 --> 38:36.356
You know that.

38:36.423 --> 38:37.590
Yeah, but he doesn't know that!

38:37.658 --> 38:39.392
He doesn't know that.

38:40.494 --> 38:42.729
I... I made a promise

38:42.796 --> 38:44.263
to him.
I promised him...

38:44.331 --> 38:47.133
Shelly, you have to stop
blaming yourself.

38:48.235 --> 38:51.738
Shelly, you have to stop
blaming yourself.

38:51.805 --> 38:53.172
No.

39:00.047 --> 39:02.482
You cut it out.
Cut it out.

39:02.549 --> 39:04.851
No, honey.
Honey, I'm driving.

39:04.918 --> 39:06.586
No, I'm not kidding, Damion.

39:06.653 --> 39:08.354
You're being mean, mama.

39:08.422 --> 39:11.157
I'm driving. Don't kick
my seat when I'm driving.

39:15.863 --> 39:17.296
I yelled at him.

39:17.364 --> 39:19.332
And it was...

39:19.400 --> 39:20.733
it was...

39:20.801 --> 39:24.270
The last thing he heard.

39:24.338 --> 39:25.805
That's your regret.

39:25.873 --> 39:28.808
It's not what he remembers.

39:28.876 --> 39:30.943
Look. Look how
happy he was.

39:31.011 --> 39:32.311
No, I can't. I can't.

39:32.379 --> 39:35.281
Losing him is not your fault.

39:35.349 --> 39:37.850
He was taken from you
and that's not fair.

39:37.918 --> 39:40.119
But while he was here,

39:40.187 --> 39:42.789
while you were lucky
enough to have him,

39:42.856 --> 39:44.023
he was happy.

39:44.091 --> 39:46.926
That's how he lived
and that's how he left.

40:28.469 --> 40:31.137
60 seconds.

40:31.205 --> 40:33.506
If I had just gotten there
60 seconds earlier,

40:33.574 --> 40:35.308
Emily might still be with us.

40:35.375 --> 40:37.243
Derek, you know that
you did everything you could.

40:37.311 --> 40:40.112
Yeah, yeah, I know. I did everything I could.
We all did. I know.

40:40.180 --> 40:42.415
What, that's supposed
to make me feel better?

40:42.483 --> 40:44.417
You protected each other
for years.

40:44.485 --> 40:46.452
Don't expect this
to go away anytime soon.

40:46.520 --> 40:48.254
This what? This what?
This guilt?

40:49.556 --> 40:51.123
Just because you were
the last one there

40:51.191 --> 40:54.260
doesn't mean that you
could affect the outcome.

40:54.328 --> 40:56.162
We all wish we had
that kind of control.

40:56.230 --> 40:58.464
So what do we do, we just
chalk it up to fate?

40:58.532 --> 41:02.168
What, I can't blame anybody?
What, this is the will of God? No.

41:02.236 --> 41:04.504
I do blame somebody.
I blame Doyle.

41:07.774 --> 41:11.110
Hotch, what am I
supposed to do?

41:14.414 --> 41:16.616
She was my friend.

41:19.686 --> 41:24.423
I lost my friend
right in front of me.

41:29.696 --> 41:32.965
And I'm supposed to go on
like nothing happened?

41:37.971 --> 41:40.706
You know, we, um...

41:40.774 --> 41:43.276
We come in here
and we talk to you.

41:44.878 --> 41:47.413
Where do you go?

41:48.682 --> 41:51.083
Where are you in all of this?

41:52.986 --> 41:56.122
The same place as you.

41:56.189 --> 41:58.457
Wishing she was here.
