00:43.210 --> 00:45.744
<i>Does that work for you guys?
Was the accent good?</i>

00:45.746 --> 00:47.379
<i>No? I'm not doing it again.</i>

00:47.381 --> 00:49.548
<i>And what the hell
are we looking at here?</i>

00:49.550 --> 00:52.117
<i>Is this
an alien abduction movie?</i>

00:52.119 --> 00:53.786
<i>Change this.</i>

00:53.788 --> 00:58.290
<i>But ruling them
isn't enough for this king.</i>

00:58.292 --> 01:01.193
<i>What's this now? A dark room
full of pot smokers.</i>

01:01.195 --> 01:04.563
<i>This is how we're starting
the movie? Change!</i>

01:04.565 --> 01:07.232
<i>Our story begins here</i>

01:07.234 --> 01:11.470
<i>in this Wild Westerworld.</i>

01:12.506 --> 01:14.440
<i>What the fuck is this?!</i>

01:14.442 --> 01:18.343
<i>You know what? Forget it.
Just start this shit.</i>

01:21.282 --> 01:23.282
Peasants
of Wild Westerworld,

01:23.284 --> 01:26.785
welcome to the sporting event
of the weekend.

01:35.629 --> 01:41.166
It's Aeneas!
It's A-E-N-E-A-S.

01:41.168 --> 01:43.302
Aeneas.

01:43.304 --> 01:46.538
Shit. I think
I'm going to go and, um...

01:46.540 --> 01:50.109
I think I'm going to go to the
tent and have my cock sucked.

01:50.111 --> 01:52.678
Oh, fuck. I think I just...

01:52.680 --> 01:55.380
- I just farted.
- Up we go.

01:55.382 --> 01:58.617
- This smells awful.
- I think I just shat my pants.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.655
Gonna get myself cleaned up.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.725
Fuck off!
Master of Secrets, let's go.

02:08.562 --> 02:11.296
No!

02:11.298 --> 02:14.533
What is this "Anus" shit?

02:14.535 --> 02:18.871
His name is Aeneas!
A-E-N-E-A-S.

02:18.873 --> 02:22.174
You fucking peasants
are so fucking uneducated.

02:22.176 --> 02:24.610
"Anus."
Put the fucking signs away!

02:31.385 --> 02:32.484
Hello, girls.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.571
My name is Anus!

02:52.573 --> 02:55.674
A-N-U-S!

04:24.465 --> 04:27.666
I said wine!
Give me some wine now!

04:27.668 --> 04:31.670
Don't fucking spill it on me,
you fucking idiot!

04:43.517 --> 04:44.650
Yes?

04:44.652 --> 04:46.985
- My lord.
- Yes?

04:46.987 --> 04:48.987
I have seen him.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.392
Who have you seen?

04:53.394 --> 04:55.927
The one who predicts
our future.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.963
The one who makes us envious.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.465
The one who paints pictures
of life and death

05:00.467 --> 05:04.069
with one fell swoop
of a tweet.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.382
You brought me here
for this?

05:17.384 --> 05:19.951
I swear he was out here.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.554
This is boring.

05:22.556 --> 05:23.822
Boring.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.425
Oh!

05:26.427 --> 05:28.460
There!

05:38.539 --> 05:42.341
Wow! Oh, my, he came back!

05:42.343 --> 05:43.909
Man, it's such an honor.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.345
Uh, it's like cool, man.

05:46.347 --> 05:47.946
Wow!

05:47.948 --> 05:50.949
- I've seen your future.
- Yeah, I mean, look at that!

05:50.951 --> 05:52.951
It's so bright,
I gotta wear shades.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.720
You know what I'm sayin'?

05:54.722 --> 05:56.955
Unless you quit the violence
around here,

05:56.957 --> 05:59.758
all you motherfuckers
are gonna die.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.460
Now, I'm telling you.

06:01.462 --> 06:04.496
You wanna be in any more books
or TV shows,

06:04.498 --> 06:06.498
y'all better stop
killing each other.

06:15.075 --> 06:18.510
And it shall be decreed thus.

06:18.512 --> 06:21.680
No longer shall we live
in a land where the defenseless

06:21.682 --> 06:25.016
fall prey to vicious predators
and sexual deviants.

06:25.018 --> 06:29.588
Let us restore the peace which
our ancestors once enjoyed.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.456
Excuse me, my lord,

06:31.458 --> 06:34.860
but there has never been peace
in Wild Westerworld.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.562
- No?
- No, my lord.

06:37.564 --> 06:41.032
Okay, um,
let it thus be decreed

06:41.034 --> 06:43.435
that it is time
to come out of the Dark Ages,

06:43.437 --> 06:46.905
into a new age
of everlasting peace.

06:46.907 --> 06:50.409
And that is why I want you
to join us here

06:50.411 --> 06:53.145
at Kingshire tomorrow,
sundown,

06:53.147 --> 06:55.680
for Purgefest 3000.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.149
Sounds good, doesn't it?

06:57.151 --> 07:01.787
I'm sorry, my lord,
but did you say "purge?"

07:01.789 --> 07:04.656
Yes! Yes, you impotent
cocksucker.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.158
Yes, I did.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.160
But isn't a purge
where you violently remove

07:08.162 --> 07:09.895
a group of people?

07:09.897 --> 07:12.597
No, no, no. It's more like
a bar mitzvah with music

07:12.599 --> 07:14.199
and just a few whores.

07:14.201 --> 07:16.101
Make sure they're big tits.
I like the big tits.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.702
You know that.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.504
After you've sent out
the invites,

07:19.506 --> 07:22.641
and everyone comes
to the party,

07:22.643 --> 07:26.878
and we've ushered them
all into the hall,

07:26.880 --> 07:31.450
I want you to make sure
that the doors to the hall

07:31.452 --> 07:34.052
are locked from the outside.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.927
And then I want you
to make sure

07:41.929 --> 07:46.965
that we have plenty
of dragonfire because...

07:46.967 --> 07:52.537
I'm going
to burn everyone alive.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.995
Thank you, thank you.

08:16.997 --> 08:20.966
No, really, really, thank you.
It was nothing.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.802
Now it's your turn,
baby brother.

08:25.272 --> 08:28.006
Brendan, what are you doing?
It's your turn.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.075
Hold on, hold on.
I almost got Miraxus.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.877
Oh.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.211
Flew away.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.780
Hodog.

08:35.782 --> 08:38.984
Our father, Lord Deadard
Stork, is watching,

08:38.986 --> 08:40.219
and so is our
mother, Lady Stork,

08:40.220 --> 08:42.621
and your ginger sister, Sansia,

08:42.623 --> 08:46.925
and the Polish baker,
the Puerto Rican gardener,

08:46.927 --> 08:50.795
the carpenter,
and a guy named Carlos.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.597
Hey!

09:08.882 --> 09:14.819
Okay, okay, which one of you
was a marksman at 10?

09:14.821 --> 09:16.755
I see.

09:16.757 --> 09:19.891
Well, keep practicing, Brendan.
You'll get there soon enough.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.694
I don't want to pressure you
or anything,

09:22.696 --> 09:24.296
but you're embarrassing
our entire house.

09:24.298 --> 09:26.765
Try to at least hit something
near the target this time.

09:26.767 --> 09:27.966
Just shoot.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.802
Ah! Ow, ow, ow!

09:30.804 --> 09:33.872
I'm all right.
I'm okay, I'm fine, it's okay.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.248
So what's happening?

09:43.250 --> 09:44.716
It's stuck.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.052
Oh, well.
We did our best, did we?

09:47.054 --> 09:49.821
That's all they can ask for.

09:49.823 --> 09:52.724
Look! It's him!

09:52.726 --> 09:55.026
My God, he's handsome.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.261
Excuse me.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.930
What's up,
you horny bitches!

09:58.932 --> 10:00.865
Can I get an autograph?

10:03.070 --> 10:04.936
Nothing's up, really.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.305
We're just talking about
going to get some cheeses.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.307
- Right, guys?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:11.378 --> 10:12.944
What about the wall?

10:12.946 --> 10:14.646
The gate is stuck,
Commander Doe.

10:14.648 --> 10:17.215
Well, we'll do this
the old-fashioned way.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.119
Get some help here,
brothers.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.687
- Yes, Commander Doe.
- Yes! Yes!

10:22.689 --> 10:23.788
Pull!

10:24.791 --> 10:26.091
Pull!

10:26.093 --> 10:28.360
Harder! Harder!

10:28.362 --> 10:30.762
Ham, Ham.

10:30.764 --> 10:33.098
Why are you grabbing
my nipples?

10:33.100 --> 10:37.268
Uh, I saw
the other guys helping,

10:37.270 --> 10:39.104
so I thought I'd join in.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.740
How does that help the gate
come down?

10:41.742 --> 10:44.876
Yes? Well, indeed.
Yeah, good point.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.812
Uh, my deepest apologies.
It won't happen again.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.247
It's stuck.

10:49.249 --> 10:52.684
Men, this is what you get

10:52.686 --> 10:55.186
when you let
Lord Trumpet the Orange

10:55.188 --> 10:59.090
build the wall
with the outsiders' money.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.861
Men, get the torches!

11:02.863 --> 11:04.929
There's someone coming.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.033
Hello, everybody!

11:08.035 --> 11:11.770
It's me,
Lord Trumpet of Orange,

11:11.772 --> 11:15.073
and I want to give you
an update on my ratings.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.441
They're incredible.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.044
They're amazing.
They're tremendous.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.278
Talk about the wall, sir.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.813
Shut up, Miller.

11:21.815 --> 11:25.717
This amazing wall,
which I installed

11:25.719 --> 11:27.852
and was paid
for by the brown people,

11:27.854 --> 11:31.222
who, by the way,
did not vote for me.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.058
Very stupid.
It's sad, frankly.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.859
No brown people, sir.

11:34.861 --> 11:38.763
This wall was built
with the finest wood

11:38.765 --> 11:42.267
in all of Wild Westerworld.

11:42.269 --> 11:46.738
And as you can see,
it's huge.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.740
Just like my penis.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.179
My stars!

11:54.181 --> 11:58.149
You are like a stallion
of Valdar!

12:03.423 --> 12:05.757
Ohh! Ride me!

12:05.759 --> 12:09.427
Ride me to the end of the world,
you beast!

12:14.234 --> 12:18.036
Denise, my skanky,
slutty sister, there you are.

12:18.038 --> 12:21.172
Look what just arrived
from Kingshire.

12:24.778 --> 12:27.879
It looks like
an invitation to a party.

12:30.484 --> 12:33.017
When they write
the history of my reign,

12:33.019 --> 12:35.120
it will start today.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.892
How exciting.
What day is it?

12:40.894 --> 12:43.795
February 31st! Now we shall
travel to Kingshire at once

12:43.797 --> 12:47.398
and deliver a special surprise
to our friend, the king.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.368
- I thought you hated the king.
- Of course I hate him.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.236
He's flatulating
all over my throne.

12:51.238 --> 12:54.372
But if you hate him, then why
will you give him a surprise?

12:54.374 --> 12:57.242
Never mind. Pack your things
and bring the savage with you!

13:00.013 --> 13:01.846
Ohh!

13:07.220 --> 13:08.887
Good evening.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.923
We're going to a party
in Kingshire.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.158
Are there snacks?

13:13.160 --> 13:14.993
More snacks
than you can imagine.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.427
Can I come?

13:16.429 --> 13:19.264
Of course you can come!
You're the surprise!

13:19.266 --> 13:21.399
Wait. I'm not popping out
of a cake again.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.035
We're going to give him
our dragon?

13:24.037 --> 13:26.971
No, no, not exactly.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.540
We shall hide Piff
inside a pie,

13:28.542 --> 13:30.442
and the king will cut it,
and then Piff will pop out

13:30.443 --> 13:32.143
and eat the king
in front of everyone,

13:32.145 --> 13:34.913
and I will be the new ruler
of Wild Westerworld.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.414
Did you just say,
"Eat the king?"

13:36.416 --> 13:38.483
Yes, I did.
Do you have a problem with that?

13:38.485 --> 13:40.351
Well, I'm actually
a pescatarian,

13:40.353 --> 13:44.222
so I don't eat any living
creature apart from fish

13:44.224 --> 13:46.891
because they deserve it,
because they're dickheads.

13:46.893 --> 13:49.527
Then just chew his head off
and spit it out.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.329
What do I care?
As long as he dies.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.832
Can I choke him out?
I'm not very good around blood.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.166
Yes, I just need him dead.

13:55.168 --> 13:58.303
Hold on,
I've got a better idea.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.405
What about Killer here?

14:00.407 --> 14:01.573
Uh, no.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.875
You will do the killing.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.343
Well, I've already
named him Killer,

14:05.345 --> 14:07.612
so it just seems appropriate
that he should kill.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.314
I said no.
You will kill him.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.482
Fine, I'll kill him.

14:11.484 --> 14:14.419
He'll be dead to you,
just like you're dead to me.

14:14.421 --> 14:17.589
Meet me by the pile of horseshit
when he's done with you.

14:17.591 --> 14:20.058
Which one?

14:24.631 --> 14:27.899
Diego, my moon and my stars,

14:27.901 --> 14:29.968
can you go harder?

14:31.571 --> 14:35.039
Harder! Harder like you're
taking me to the moon!

14:38.245 --> 14:40.945
Yes! Yes!

15:34.200 --> 15:35.934
Oh, my God!

15:35.936 --> 15:39.237
It's got like an invitation.
It's a party!

15:39.239 --> 15:42.674
Clearly that's for me.
This is my pool.

15:42.676 --> 15:44.008
Yeah, but...

15:55.989 --> 15:57.388
Thank you!

15:57.390 --> 16:00.224
Phone, Sebastian,
give me my phone.

16:00.226 --> 16:01.526
Thank you.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.466
Oh, my God! Me too!

16:08.468 --> 16:12.337
Pack your things
because we're going to a party!

16:13.673 --> 16:15.540
Oh, well, this says
it's like,

16:15.542 --> 16:19.077
"Genocide,
but without the Jews.

16:19.079 --> 16:22.013
And bring your own whores."

16:22.015 --> 16:23.581
Oh, my God, you're right.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.050
We could be the whores!

16:26.052 --> 16:29.153
Oh, my God,
we're gonna be so famous!

16:29.155 --> 16:31.055
Come on, Sebastian!

16:32.225 --> 16:35.193
Why?

16:35.195 --> 16:38.029
Because it's Purgefest.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.098
Duh.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.604
Oh, no! Oh, no!
I told you guys.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.206
I told you we shouldn't
have come here.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.641
No! We're going to die!

16:50.643 --> 16:53.311
Gods, help us!

16:53.313 --> 16:57.081
Where are you going?
You fucking cowards!

16:57.083 --> 16:59.650
Johnny, do something!

16:59.652 --> 17:00.785
Do the hair!

17:00.787 --> 17:02.353
Yeah!

17:03.690 --> 17:05.723
The dance magic!
Yeah, do it, Johnny!

17:19.705 --> 17:22.773
Shake your hair, bitch!
Do it!

17:28.782 --> 17:30.815
Oh, that's hot!
That's hot!

17:30.817 --> 17:32.617
Oh, yeah, yeah!
Go for all of them.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.185
All of them!

17:37.657 --> 17:39.357
Wow!

17:39.359 --> 17:41.426
Fuck me!

17:48.201 --> 17:49.367
Do it, Johnny! Do...

17:51.237 --> 17:53.404
Holy mother of...

17:53.406 --> 17:55.673
Holy shit!

18:00.613 --> 18:04.482
Uncle Tony, Lord of Iron!

18:04.484 --> 18:07.518
Holy shit!
How did you do that?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.520
Screw my suit.
You guys going to Purgefest?

18:09.522 --> 18:12.190
Ah, my family wouldn't
want me there. I'm a bastard.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.491
Your family
won't want you there?

18:13.493 --> 18:15.793
I'm your family!
You know what you need?

18:15.795 --> 18:17.228
You need some makeup.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.130
Make yourself pretty
on the inside.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.698
- Does that work?
- Does it work?

18:20.700 --> 18:22.233
How do you think
I met your mother?

18:22.235 --> 18:23.601
- You know my mother?
- Of course!

18:23.603 --> 18:25.269
- I'm your uncle.
- Who is she?

18:25.271 --> 18:27.839
Listen, go to Purgefest,
you'll meet your mother.

18:27.841 --> 18:29.874
Can't go right now.
I gotta go to Segovia.

18:29.876 --> 18:33.744
I got a hot widow in a castle,
and she's waiting for me.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.546
But you guys,
I'll see you at Purgefest?

18:35.548 --> 18:37.715
- All right, good.
- Later, guys.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.350
So cool.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.452
Everyone has a weird uncle.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.488
Sorry, Father.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.823
I was aiming for the target,
but he was in the way.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.358
It's okay, boy.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.329
Lord Stork, Lady Stork.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.164
The guardsmen have returned
from the hillside.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.866
They captured the deserter
from the wall.

18:54.868 --> 18:57.235
Tell the men
to saddle the horses.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.804
- Brendan, you come with me.
- Are you sure, Deadard?

18:59.806 --> 19:03.541
Don't you think he's too young
to see such things?

19:03.543 --> 19:05.776
He won't be a child forever,
my dear.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.478
This will be
a good lesson for him.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.213
Come on, Brendan.

19:09.215 --> 19:13.751
I will teach you
how to deal with the deserters.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.686
I got peanuts!

19:15.688 --> 19:16.721
Beer!

19:16.723 --> 19:18.689
Toy heads for the kids!

19:18.691 --> 19:21.659
Peanuts! Peanuts!

19:21.661 --> 19:23.828
Is there anything you'd like
to say in your defense

19:23.830 --> 19:25.696
before I deliver your sentence?

19:25.698 --> 19:28.833
Yeah. I know I hopped the wall,
but I'm not a goddamn deserter.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.302
I know I shouldn't have ran,
but I saw what I saw,

19:31.304 --> 19:32.804
so I went as fast
as me legs could carry.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.739
You might think I deserve
to die like a dog.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.441
People won't hear the truth.
Made a cat eat all your ears.

19:36.442 --> 19:39.911
And the devil ate the cat,
and that's all.

19:39.913 --> 19:42.380
Does anyone understand
what this man said?

19:42.382 --> 19:43.581
No.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.717
Very well.
Off with his head.

19:46.719 --> 19:47.852
Yay!

19:51.824 --> 19:54.258
Fucking gobshite.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.461
In the name of
Walter of the House of Falafel...

19:56.462 --> 19:57.962
Cut!
Cut, cut, cut, cut!

19:57.964 --> 20:00.565
We can't hear you!
Where's the boom guy?

20:03.836 --> 20:06.270
- Is he union?
- No!

20:06.272 --> 20:08.940
Yay! I'm free!

20:10.543 --> 20:13.244
In the name of Walter
of the House of Falafel,

20:13.246 --> 20:17.915
I, Deadard, son of Fendrial,
husband of Lady Stork,

20:17.917 --> 20:22.353
lover of Athena, Catrina,
Seraphina, and Salvador,

20:22.355 --> 20:24.822
father of Macauley McCulkin,

20:24.824 --> 20:27.658
Boped, Ariana, Celsia...

20:27.660 --> 20:29.527
Oh, just do it already!

20:29.529 --> 20:30.962
Who said that?

20:30.964 --> 20:32.663
Father. Sorry, I just...

20:32.665 --> 20:34.932
I can't stand
the sight of real blood.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.634
This is the old way, boy.

20:36.636 --> 20:39.737
The man who passes the sentence
must deliver the blow.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.806
Now, put that game down.
Come here.

20:41.808 --> 20:42.940
I'll chop his head off.

20:45.612 --> 20:46.777
Hodog.

20:49.315 --> 20:52.316
You may go.
My boy will hold him down.

20:52.318 --> 20:54.719
Now hold him. Hold still.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.487
Steady.

21:00.460 --> 21:03.961
I told you to stay steady!

21:03.963 --> 21:08.466
Here comes Lady Stork.
Don't say a word.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.868
Oh, hello, my dear.
What brings you here?

21:10.870 --> 21:12.303
Where's Brendan?

21:12.305 --> 21:13.704
He had a small accident,

21:13.706 --> 21:15.873
but it's nothing
the maester can't fix.

21:15.875 --> 21:20.444
We just received an invitation
to Kingshire for Purgefest 3000.

21:20.446 --> 21:21.946
What is that?

21:21.948 --> 21:25.016
A party to purge all violence
from the kingdoms.

21:25.018 --> 21:26.817
That is wonderful!

21:26.819 --> 21:28.786
I think that
you should go alone.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.454
Our enemies will be there,

21:30.456 --> 21:32.556
and it may be dangerous
for the children.

21:32.558 --> 21:34.859
- What say you?
- Father!

21:34.861 --> 21:37.628
Prince Jizzy will be there,
and I must meet him.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.831
He's the love of my life.
I'm going to marry him.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.833
I want to lie naked
in his bed

21:42.835 --> 21:45.636
while he drizzles hot honey
all over my body.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.071
Now, now, don't get upset.

21:47.073 --> 21:50.308
There's no safer place
in the entire realm

21:50.310 --> 21:52.009
than Kingshire, my dear.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.979
I'm certain that nothing bad
will happen to us.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.848
My children, pack your bags.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.850
We're going to the capital!

22:26.946 --> 22:29.947
And now the benevolent,

22:29.949 --> 22:31.682
the magnificent,

22:31.684 --> 22:34.685
and the extremely dignified

22:34.687 --> 22:36.721
Prince Jizzy!

22:38.925 --> 22:40.524
That's my boy!

22:45.798 --> 22:49.100
<i>♪ Ladies, ladies
All the sexy ladies ♪</i>

22:49.102 --> 22:52.603
<i>♪ Longing for a prince
like me ♪</i>

22:52.605 --> 22:55.873
<i>♪ Some of them
be cherry red ♪</i>

22:55.875 --> 22:58.576
<i>♪ Some be lewd
and some be shrewd ♪</i>

22:58.578 --> 23:02.546
<i>♪ All longing

23:02.548 --> 23:04.749
Mongrel,
you're in the wrong key!

23:04.751 --> 23:08.419
I believe it is the right one,
Your Grace.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.488
What did you say?

23:10.490 --> 23:12.456
That you are right,
Your Grace.

23:12.458 --> 23:15.426
I believe the only right key

23:15.428 --> 23:18.396
is the one that will open
the door to this shithole,

23:18.398 --> 23:22.133
so we can all get out before
this penis starts singing again.

23:22.135 --> 23:23.934
What did you call me?

23:23.936 --> 23:28.072
Your Mostly Honorable...

23:28.074 --> 23:31.075
Prince Jizzy, of course.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.010
That's what I thought.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.113
Mongrel, kill him!

23:44.824 --> 23:46.157
Mommy!

23:46.159 --> 23:49.160
Ha! That's it!
Run to mommy, ya bitch.

23:49.162 --> 23:51.762
Mongrel,
go play something for me.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.165
Go!

23:54.167 --> 23:55.766
Mommy!

24:04.544 --> 24:07.545
I like my boy strong.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.749
Ooh!

24:11.751 --> 24:12.850
Yes!

24:26.766 --> 24:29.567
Now, good boy.

24:37.844 --> 24:40.110
Did you get your invitation
to Purgefest?

24:40.112 --> 24:42.780
I got it.
It's a good plan.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.548
What are you talking about?

24:44.550 --> 24:46.884
It's the stupidest idea
I've ever heard.

24:46.886 --> 24:51.055
Just another one of my husband's
stupid, bloody ideas

24:51.057 --> 24:52.823
that drunk bastard...

24:52.825 --> 24:54.258
What?

24:54.260 --> 24:56.861
It's a brilliant opportunity
to kill him.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.863
What did you say?

24:58.865 --> 25:03.767
I said Purgefest
is an excellent opportunity

25:03.769 --> 25:06.003
to kill your husband.

25:06.005 --> 25:10.207
You're not just
a beautiful face, are you?

25:10.209 --> 25:13.010
You've got stuff going on
up there.

25:13.012 --> 25:17.915
I love it
when you talk dirty to me.

25:17.917 --> 25:19.917
After the king is dead,

25:19.919 --> 25:22.953
our son will take the throne.

25:22.955 --> 25:24.622
- Jizzy?
- Jizzy.

25:24.624 --> 25:26.190
- Jizzy.
- Jizzy.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.292
- Jizzy?
- Jizzy.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.727
Jizzy!

25:30.796 --> 25:31.829
Jizzy!

25:34.133 --> 25:35.232
Ohh!

25:40.239 --> 25:41.872
Mother?

25:46.979 --> 25:49.246
Hello, s-s-s...
Nephew.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.785
I heard someone in this
direction calling my name.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.654
Oh?

25:56.656 --> 25:59.590
Oh, honey, you must be
hearing things.

25:59.592 --> 26:02.092
Why don't you go run along
and play with yourself?

26:02.094 --> 26:04.094
I'm not finished
with your uncle.

26:04.096 --> 26:05.263
Can I go shoot peasants
with my crossbow?

26:05.264 --> 26:07.831
No, honey, not today.

26:07.833 --> 26:09.833
I just can't be bothered
with any maimed bumpkins

26:09.835 --> 26:12.870
whining with their retched
families at the castle gates.

26:12.872 --> 26:14.772
- Please, Mother!
- Not today!

26:15.975 --> 26:17.775
Sorry. I'm sorry.

26:17.777 --> 26:18.943
I'm sorry.

26:22.949 --> 26:24.114
What's this?

26:25.952 --> 26:27.952
Is this a toy from the future?

26:27.954 --> 26:31.322
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
Give your uncle his hand back!

26:31.324 --> 26:32.890
Give your uncle
his hand back now!

26:32.892 --> 26:35.092
No way!
It's too much fun!

26:35.094 --> 26:36.093
No!

26:36.095 --> 26:37.828
You know what?

26:37.830 --> 26:38.996
Darling.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.299
I changed my mind.

26:42.301 --> 26:46.070
You can go shoot
the peasants now, darling.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.805
Thank you, Mother.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.093
Hello, everybody.

27:09.095 --> 27:14.698
Have you noticed the beautiful
white swans behind me?

27:14.700 --> 27:18.369
They remind me
of my favorite type of people:

27:18.371 --> 27:20.137
Graceful and white.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.039
Very, very white.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.174
Inclusivity, sir.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.877
They are so beautiful,

27:26.879 --> 27:31.215
and they love me for
bringing them into this world,

27:31.217 --> 27:35.919
almost as much as my beautiful
Russian mail-order bride.

27:35.921 --> 27:38.322
And you know what the
best part about the swans is?

27:38.324 --> 27:41.358
They're just as racist as I am.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.926
Non-racist, sir.

27:42.928 --> 27:46.030
Non-racist as I am.

27:59.879 --> 28:02.379
It's so beautiful out here.

28:02.381 --> 28:04.815
I wonder who planted
all these trees.

28:04.817 --> 28:07.785
Must've spent a fortune
in gardeners.

28:10.089 --> 28:12.923
Hey, where are you going,
you asswipe?

28:12.925 --> 28:15.793
Come back here!
I'll sue you.

28:15.795 --> 28:18.729
- Where'd he go?
- I can't believe he did that.

28:18.731 --> 28:20.397
Let's get out.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.032
Okay. Let's check it.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.100
Whoa!

28:23.102 --> 28:24.802
Okay, I'm fine.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.336
Okay.

28:27.473 --> 28:29.339
Where did he go?

28:31.811 --> 28:33.911
- Oh, no. Your tit's hanging out
- Oh, yeah.

28:33.913 --> 28:36.480
Uh, put it away for once.

28:36.482 --> 28:37.915
No one can see.

28:37.917 --> 28:40.417
Yeah, that's true.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.753
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

28:46.859 --> 28:49.126
You've got to be
kidding me right now.

28:49.128 --> 28:51.962
When you meet your gods,

28:51.964 --> 28:56.900
tell them Shaggy,
son of Scooby,

28:56.902 --> 28:59.770
from the Rock, Paper,
Scissor clan sent you.

28:59.772 --> 29:02.206
Please don't kill me.

29:05.745 --> 29:07.911
And...

29:07.913 --> 29:10.280
Tell me...

29:10.282 --> 29:13.050
where do women of your physique
come from?

29:13.052 --> 29:15.819
The hills of Beverly.

29:15.821 --> 29:18.122
Do they all have
the same curves as you?

29:18.124 --> 29:22.392
Most do, yes,
if they can afford it.

29:22.394 --> 29:25.195
I think we may
have to visit someday!

29:26.499 --> 29:28.031
After we kill you.

29:28.033 --> 29:29.533
What?

29:42.314 --> 29:43.847
- Get out!
- Just do it.

29:43.849 --> 29:45.983
Okay, okay.

29:45.985 --> 29:50.554
Mr. Shaggy, my name is Clueless
of House Kardushian.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.960
Tell me, Clueless,
how would you like to die?

30:00.833 --> 30:04.434
Choking on a gallon of
mint chocolate chip ice cream

30:04.436 --> 30:06.036
in my Jacuzzi,

30:06.038 --> 30:08.405
while having sex with you.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.810
The fat one's
got a sense of humor!

30:12.812 --> 30:15.078
Take her as a slave
and kill the other one.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.347
- What?
- What?

30:17.349 --> 30:19.349
Who are you calling fat,
bitch!

30:20.352 --> 30:21.885
Oh, yeah!

30:21.887 --> 30:23.320
Oh, she's feisty.

30:23.322 --> 30:26.223
Give me back my hammer
or the family dies.

30:26.225 --> 30:28.392
Hang on a second!

30:28.394 --> 30:31.261
How many followers
do you have?

30:36.569 --> 30:40.370
I have five followers.

30:40.372 --> 30:44.308
How do you expect me
to take you seriously

30:44.310 --> 30:47.211
if you only have
five followers?

30:47.213 --> 30:48.846
How many do you have?

30:48.848 --> 30:50.347
Thousands.

30:51.383 --> 30:52.916
Where are they?

30:52.918 --> 30:55.552
They're in here.

30:55.554 --> 30:58.155
And when I make my sex tape,

30:58.157 --> 31:04.127
I'll have millions
and millions of followers.

31:04.129 --> 31:05.295
Well, join the club!

31:05.297 --> 31:07.097
Everyone does that
around here.

31:07.099 --> 31:08.365
Really?

31:08.367 --> 31:10.968
Oh, yeah!
Practically all the time.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.536
Yeah!

31:12.538 --> 31:16.473
How am I supposed
to get famous now?

31:27.353 --> 31:29.353
Somebody say famous?

31:31.624 --> 31:33.290
Me.

31:33.292 --> 31:34.658
Me famous?

31:34.660 --> 31:37.895
I can make
all you bitches famous.

31:40.599 --> 31:42.966
- Can we take a selfie?
- Oh, my God, yeah!

31:42.968 --> 31:44.468
Okay, duck face.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.603
Famous!

31:48.474 --> 31:50.407
Your Majesty.

32:00.185 --> 32:02.552
Shut up!
I'm... I'm hunting.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.421
- My apologizes, my lord.
- Yes!

32:04.423 --> 32:07.157
You've done it again,
Your Majesty.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.392
First shot.

32:08.394 --> 32:11.295
Very good.
Take that beast

32:11.297 --> 32:14.932
and give it to the cook
for tonight's feast.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.468
The event is just
hours away, my lord.

32:18.470 --> 32:19.536
Yes.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.572
The, um...

32:22.574 --> 32:24.474
Yes, spit it out.

32:24.476 --> 32:29.212
The dragonfire
has disappeared.

32:29.214 --> 32:32.115
Dragonfire has disappeared?
How does the dragonfire...

32:32.117 --> 32:37.254
How does the dragonfire
disappear?

32:37.256 --> 32:40.490
I'm afraid I do not know,
my lord.

32:40.492 --> 32:43.060
I'm going to explain
one thing to you.

32:43.062 --> 32:45.195
You're gonna get rid of
all those people tonight.

32:45.197 --> 32:46.630
I don't care how you do it.

32:46.632 --> 32:49.032
You throw them off
the castle wall.

32:49.034 --> 32:51.201
You drown them in the moat.

32:51.203 --> 32:55.138
Feed them to the little beasties
of the fucking forest.

32:55.140 --> 32:58.175
Use your imagination,
will ya, man?

32:58.177 --> 33:00.177
I'll think of something.

33:00.179 --> 33:02.446
Hold my wine.

33:02.448 --> 33:06.049
Ah, come here,
you little bastard.

33:17.296 --> 33:20.297
Any more bad news
for the king today?

33:20.299 --> 33:24.001
Lord Deadard Stork and
his family are about to arrive.

33:24.003 --> 33:27.137
Would you like to greet him?

33:27.139 --> 33:29.706
Well, yes,
of course I'd like to greet

33:29.708 --> 33:33.610
my dear long-lost friend.

33:33.612 --> 33:38.482
I mean, why didn't you bring
that up in the first place?

33:38.484 --> 33:41.118
Do you wanna tell me,
you fucking...

33:51.363 --> 33:54.664
The king is like
a feather in the air.

33:54.666 --> 33:57.601
He goes whichever way
the wind blows.

33:57.603 --> 34:02.506
And right now
Deadard is blowing him hard.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.790
Oh, that's lovely.

34:19.792 --> 34:22.225
Good work. Yes.

34:33.138 --> 34:35.371
Ah, there we go.

34:42.147 --> 34:44.514
Lord Trumpet's wall.

34:44.516 --> 34:47.751
Journal entry number one.

34:47.753 --> 34:52.656
It's cold as shit out here
in the middle of nowhere

34:52.658 --> 34:56.259
as we look for nothing
for no reason whatsoever.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.198
The story of my life.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.400
A bastard life.

35:03.402 --> 35:04.734
I'm bored.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.736
We can be on our way
to Purgefest right now.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.805
No one wants
two more bastards.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.474
Oh, come on.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.642
Half of the people
in this kingdom are bastards,

35:12.644 --> 35:15.312
and the other half
are just inbred morons.

35:15.314 --> 35:18.348
Besides, there will be women,

35:18.350 --> 35:21.685
entertainment, chesses.

35:21.687 --> 35:24.154
Hmm? All the essentials.

35:26.525 --> 35:31.194
<i>♪ I'm a bastard child ♪</i>

35:31.196 --> 35:33.797
<i>♪ Living on a wall ♪</i>

35:33.799 --> 35:37.734
<i>♪ With 40 celibate men ♪</i>

35:37.736 --> 35:41.438
Uh, wait.
I didn't want to scare you,

35:41.440 --> 35:44.474
but I received a note
from an owl earlier

35:44.476 --> 35:47.577
that said the Storks
might be in danger.

35:47.579 --> 35:50.680
When did you see an owl?

35:50.682 --> 35:53.917
Uh, it-it was when I...

35:53.919 --> 35:57.220
When I went to the bathroom.

35:57.222 --> 35:59.689
I've been with you all day.
Who sent it?

35:59.691 --> 36:01.925
It was anonymous.

36:01.927 --> 36:05.595
I've never heard of him.
Where is it?

36:05.597 --> 36:07.898
I-I burned it.

36:07.900 --> 36:09.733
Why would you
burn the message?

36:09.735 --> 36:11.869
Because I was afraid it would
get into the wrong hands.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.637
Look, we can
discuss this forever,

36:13.639 --> 36:15.572
but the point is
we don't have much time.

36:15.574 --> 36:18.642
If we don't head out now,
your family might be killed.

36:18.644 --> 36:20.343
My family doesn't
want to see me.

36:20.345 --> 36:22.812
Oh, bloody hell.
Are you going to sit here

36:22.814 --> 36:24.548
moping all day
about not having a mother?

36:24.550 --> 36:27.684
Or are you going to get up
and do something?

36:31.356 --> 36:33.823
Let's go to Purgefest
right now!

36:35.727 --> 36:38.295
Both of us.
Let's do it.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.197
Yes, you're right.

36:44.236 --> 36:45.969
- Pack your bags.
- Yes.

36:45.971 --> 36:48.305
- Get your best dress.
- Yes!

36:48.307 --> 36:50.307
I'll get the car.
We're going to Purgefest!

36:50.309 --> 36:53.343
Yes!
Yes, let's do it, Johnny!

37:02.821 --> 37:05.722
Don't tell me you're playing
that stupid game again.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.557
It's not stupid.
I like it.

37:07.559 --> 37:10.760
Promise me you won't play
with it while were in Kingshire.

37:10.762 --> 37:11.895
Promise.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.930
Hodog, no playing.

37:13.932 --> 37:14.932
Hodog, Hodog.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.250
Your Grace.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.954
You look old.

37:40.759 --> 37:42.359
And you're so fat,

37:42.361 --> 37:44.728
the last time
they took out the catapult,

37:44.730 --> 37:46.997
they thought
you were the boulder.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.443
Just like the old days!

38:04.316 --> 38:07.317
- Your Grace.
- Hello, darling.

38:07.319 --> 38:11.488
Tight as a fist,
as always, hmm?

38:11.490 --> 38:13.556
And where are
the little ones?

38:13.558 --> 38:15.959
Ooh!

38:15.961 --> 38:19.529
Not so little anymore,
are ya, Little Bobby?

38:19.531 --> 38:22.465
Tortured any defenseless
little puppies lately?

38:25.037 --> 38:28.905
Oh! You must be
the tomboy, hmm?

38:28.907 --> 38:31.641
Ohh! Hmm?

38:35.047 --> 38:36.613
Hello in there!

38:38.784 --> 38:40.450
Ohh!

38:40.452 --> 38:42.452
Oh, it's the pretty
little girly one.

38:42.454 --> 38:44.888
She loves to play with
the little dollies, does she?

38:44.890 --> 38:47.524
The little dollies! Ohh!

38:50.996 --> 38:54.464
Ah! And what have we here?
We have the athletic little one.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.833
Up and down.
Show us those legs.

39:00.706 --> 39:02.539
I like pussy.

39:02.541 --> 39:03.606
Hodog.

39:03.608 --> 39:04.941
Oh.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.676
- Pussy.
- Hodog.

39:06.678 --> 39:07.977
- Pussy.
- Hodog.

39:07.979 --> 39:09.012
- Pussy.
- Hodog.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.080
Mm.

39:12.918 --> 39:15.118
Welcome to Kingshire.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.387
Mi casa, su casa.

39:17.389 --> 39:20.757
Meet the family.
Come here!

39:20.759 --> 39:22.025
This is Cursey, my wife.

39:27.799 --> 39:28.965
And Johnny.

39:28.967 --> 39:31.134
"Bang Bang Johnny"
we call him.

39:31.136 --> 39:34.604
Because he likes to bang
anything that fucking moves.

39:34.606 --> 39:38.675
And Jizzy, my boy.
I'm so fucking proud of him.

39:38.677 --> 39:40.977
Great shot with that thing.

39:40.979 --> 39:42.846
I think he looks just like you.

39:42.848 --> 39:43.980
He does, does he?

39:43.982 --> 39:45.582
Tell me about this Purgefest.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.917
Why this big party
all of the sudden?

39:47.919 --> 39:49.786
You've never done anything
like this before.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.488
Well, excuse us.

39:51.490 --> 39:53.156
We've got a little talk.
Come on.

39:56.094 --> 40:00.029
You're the best friend I have
in the whole wide world,

40:00.031 --> 40:01.831
so I'm gonna be honest with you.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.166
This isn't a party.

40:03.168 --> 40:05.468
I'm gonna just
kill the competition

40:05.470 --> 40:06.936
before it kills me, right?

40:06.938 --> 40:09.706
You're becoming paranoid.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.441
Everyone loves you.

40:11.443 --> 40:13.977
Me? I'd give my left testicle
for you!

40:13.979 --> 40:15.845
That's 'cause you're a moron.

40:15.847 --> 40:17.714
Call me what you will.

40:17.716 --> 40:20.917
But I still believe
in the old ways:

40:20.919 --> 40:26.055
Loyalty, honesty,
character, and integrity.

40:29.961 --> 40:31.961
Okay, I'll go get a snack.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.835
While I figure out

40:38.837 --> 40:43.940
how to murder
every single one of them.

40:48.780 --> 40:51.448
That's the most disgusting thing
I've ever seen.

40:51.450 --> 40:53.750
At least use a fork and knife,
you pig.

40:53.752 --> 40:56.719
And what's taking you so long?
I'd like to keep moving.

41:02.160 --> 41:05.695
You are an embarrassment
to me and our entire family.

41:05.697 --> 41:06.996
When I rule the Eight Kingdoms,

41:06.998 --> 41:08.765
I will have
to educate you properly.

41:08.767 --> 41:11.167
You can't just be
on a rocking horse

41:11.169 --> 41:12.969
with that beast of yours

41:12.971 --> 41:15.705
and dining on horse parts
with your bare hands!

41:21.646 --> 41:23.079
We're about to produce

41:23.081 --> 41:25.615
the greatest dynasty
the world has ever known.

41:25.617 --> 41:27.250
We are dragons!

41:27.252 --> 41:29.552
Well, I'm a dragon.
I don't know what you are.

41:29.554 --> 41:33.756
- Actually, I'm the dragon.
- How dare you correct me!

41:33.758 --> 41:35.925
You say I'm the dragon.
You say I'm the dragon!

41:35.927 --> 41:37.727
- You're the drag...
- Say I'm the dragon!

41:37.729 --> 41:40.497
- You're the dragon.
- And don't you forget it.

41:40.499 --> 41:41.764
And by the way...

41:41.766 --> 41:43.566
Aaahh!

41:43.568 --> 41:45.768
That's what a real dragon
sounds like.

41:45.770 --> 41:48.838
Take it easy.
Diego's going to get mad.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.174
So what if he gets mad?

41:51.176 --> 41:53.209
The imbecile doesn't even
speak the common tongue.

41:53.211 --> 41:55.278
He's getting pissed.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.780
He may not speak it,
but he understands it.

41:57.782 --> 41:59.983
I want to go! Now!

41:59.985 --> 42:03.052
I want the crown I deserve!

42:09.628 --> 42:10.960
Okay, what did he say?

42:10.962 --> 42:13.196
He said he'll give you
your crown.

42:13.198 --> 42:16.766
No! What?
Denise, what's happening?

42:16.768 --> 42:18.535
What is he doing
with that bucket?

42:18.537 --> 42:20.537
No, you keep that
away from me.

42:20.539 --> 42:22.238
I am the king!

42:22.240 --> 42:24.774
A crown for a king!

42:24.776 --> 42:26.009
No!

42:45.230 --> 42:46.930
- I think he's dead.
- Sí.

42:53.038 --> 42:56.172
- You want some of this?
- Yes, please, thank you.

42:56.174 --> 42:58.341
Mmm! Yum, yum, yum, yum.

43:17.829 --> 43:22.065
I have stolen
all the dragonfire

43:22.067 --> 43:24.634
and hidden it
in the basement.

43:24.636 --> 43:26.002
Yes.

43:26.004 --> 43:30.173
When all the families
sit down for the feast,

43:30.175 --> 43:31.941
I will burn them,

43:31.943 --> 43:36.746
and you and I will be
the new rulers of the kingdom!

43:36.748 --> 43:39.248
Yes! I got you,
you nasty little devil.

43:39.250 --> 43:41.250
Now, wait till I tell
all of my friends about you.

43:41.252 --> 43:43.386
They won't believe it.

43:43.388 --> 43:44.787
Get him!

43:46.157 --> 43:48.625
Quite the little pervert,
aren't you?

43:48.627 --> 43:49.959
What's happening?
What's going on?

43:49.961 --> 43:51.894
I was just up here
having some fun.

43:51.896 --> 43:54.864
Having some fun?
Is that what you call it?

43:54.866 --> 43:56.232
I was playing with my dragon.

43:56.234 --> 43:57.967
Clobbering the creature, yes?

43:57.969 --> 44:00.803
- Popping the beast.
- Chasing the serpent?

44:00.805 --> 44:03.006
Tickling the lizard?
We get it.

44:03.008 --> 44:06.075
What are you doing?
You're going to kill him.

44:06.077 --> 44:07.276
I'm saving our asses.

44:10.682 --> 44:13.282
The kid is just playing
Dragon Bone.

44:15.320 --> 44:16.419
Right.

44:20.291 --> 44:22.291
Can I have
my Dragon Bone back, please?

44:22.293 --> 44:23.960
This does nothing but
numb your brain

44:23.962 --> 44:25.228
and get you in trouble.

44:25.230 --> 44:27.330
No! My Dragon Bone!

44:31.770 --> 44:33.036
It's okay.

44:33.038 --> 44:36.205
The game... still works.

44:37.442 --> 44:40.343
He's still alive.

44:40.345 --> 44:41.944
It's a miracle.

44:51.389 --> 44:54.724
I saw the best joust match
the other day.

44:54.726 --> 44:57.060
Anus stuck the tip of his lance
into the other guy's neck.

44:57.062 --> 44:59.195
There was blood
gushing everywhere.

44:59.197 --> 45:00.730
It was pretty fun.

45:00.732 --> 45:01.831
Sounds interesting.

45:04.302 --> 45:06.069
No, I don't.

45:06.071 --> 45:07.071
Do it.

45:09.407 --> 45:11.040
Okay!

45:42.974 --> 45:44.974
What is it, my sweet lady?

45:44.976 --> 45:46.442
Does Mongrel bother you?

45:48.213 --> 45:51.347
Away with you, Mongrel!
You're scaring my lady!

45:55.320 --> 45:57.987
There. Now it's just
the two of us.

45:57.989 --> 46:00.790
So...

46:00.792 --> 46:02.458
what do you like to do
for fun?

46:02.460 --> 46:07.330
I sew, cook,
masturbate, clean.

46:07.332 --> 46:09.932
Twice a day
in that order.

46:09.934 --> 46:12.935
A traditional woman.
I like that.

46:12.937 --> 46:15.938
I'm not into these woman
who want to work

46:15.940 --> 46:19.842
or fight or talk.

46:22.247 --> 46:24.213
Take that, fatty!

46:25.216 --> 46:27.183
You'll never defeat me!

46:27.185 --> 46:28.252
Don't worry, milady,
I've got this!

46:28.253 --> 46:29.552
Why should I be worried?

46:29.554 --> 46:31.020
- You're safe with me.
- From what?

46:31.022 --> 46:32.922
Surrender your weapon,
fat boy!

46:32.924 --> 46:34.490
Let go of my girl's sister,

46:34.492 --> 46:36.826
or I'll slice you in half
like a loaf of bread.

46:36.828 --> 46:38.060
Hey, man, relax.

46:38.062 --> 46:41.330
I'm not a man.
I'm your prince.

46:41.332 --> 46:44.233
Dude, seriously.
Stop messing around.

46:44.235 --> 46:46.135
We're actors on a movie.

46:46.137 --> 46:48.004
Don't move.
I saw it with my own eyes.

46:48.006 --> 46:49.372
You attacked her
with your sword.

46:49.374 --> 46:51.841
No, he didn't.
He's my friend

46:51.843 --> 46:53.276
This?

46:53.278 --> 46:55.378
It's just a stick.
Do you want it?

46:55.380 --> 46:56.846
En garde!

46:56.848 --> 46:59.816
- Don't, Jizzy!
- Quiet, my lady.

46:59.818 --> 47:02.285
No one can defeat me
in combat.

47:04.255 --> 47:06.823
Now fight me like a man!

47:06.825 --> 47:07.957
Ohh!

47:12.430 --> 47:14.430
How dare you
hit your prince.

47:14.432 --> 47:17.466
You aren't a prince.

47:17.468 --> 47:19.335
- You're a penis.
- What did she call me?

47:19.337 --> 47:23.072
She called you
a prince, sir.

47:23.074 --> 47:26.976
You're nothing but
a little penis.

47:26.978 --> 47:31.280
A walking, talking penis.

47:31.282 --> 47:34.150
Admit it to everybody here that
you are nothing but a penis.

47:34.152 --> 47:35.585
Never.

47:35.587 --> 47:36.619
Say it!

47:36.621 --> 47:38.487
No!

47:38.489 --> 47:40.389
No! Ow! Ow! Ow!

47:40.391 --> 47:43.159
Mommy! Ow! Mommy!

47:48.867 --> 47:50.533
Why don't people like me?

47:50.535 --> 47:53.336
They're jealous of you, sir.

47:53.338 --> 47:55.504
Am I good-looking?

47:55.506 --> 47:57.974
Yeah. Yeah, you are.

47:57.976 --> 47:59.208
You hesitated for a bit there.

47:59.210 --> 48:01.510
No, no, I didn't.

48:01.512 --> 48:04.080
- Look, you did it again.
- No.

48:04.082 --> 48:06.082
You... You're doing...

48:06.084 --> 48:07.283
Oh, all right, all right.

48:08.586 --> 48:10.253
All right, fuck you!

48:10.255 --> 48:12.221
You think you're ever
gonna be king, my boy?

48:12.223 --> 48:13.589
You've got another thing coming.

48:13.591 --> 48:15.191
You're always gonna be
a little prince

48:15.193 --> 48:16.959
who's got a little dick.

48:16.961 --> 48:19.629
This is the biggest dick
you're ever gonna see, my boy.

48:19.631 --> 48:21.564
In this water,
this reflection,

48:21.566 --> 48:24.100
is the only dick
you're ever gonna have.

48:28.072 --> 48:31.340
So are you guys coming with us
to Purgefest or what?

48:31.342 --> 48:33.075
I don't know.

48:33.077 --> 48:35.177
I don't know if that place
is our scene, really.

48:40.051 --> 48:42.585
Who is that?

48:44.289 --> 48:46.055
The fat one?

48:46.057 --> 48:49.125
No, the one with the hair.

48:49.127 --> 48:51.127
He's so hot.

48:59.237 --> 49:02.405
You two need to leave!

49:02.407 --> 49:05.374
There is no place for you
in here.

49:05.376 --> 49:09.378
Now leave before
I smash you with my hammer!

49:09.380 --> 49:11.647
Oh, uh, I see.

49:11.649 --> 49:14.951
Well, I think I saw another inn
a few steps from here.

49:14.953 --> 49:18.454
Maybe we should go to that one,
shouldn't we?

49:18.456 --> 49:19.956
Yeah.

49:23.261 --> 49:25.328
Why should we leave?

49:25.330 --> 49:27.997
We have the same right
to be here as any of you.

49:27.999 --> 49:29.398
Is that so?

49:30.702 --> 49:32.601
Men!

49:34.706 --> 49:38.074
On the bar. On the bar!

49:46.250 --> 49:50.653
The maester says
it's a miracle he's still alive.

49:50.655 --> 49:53.022
Help. Help!

49:53.024 --> 49:56.492
Our boy is strong.
He will survive. You'll see.

49:56.494 --> 49:59.261
I think someone pushed him
out of that tower, Deadard.

49:59.263 --> 50:01.397
I think he saw something
he shouldn't have seen,

50:01.399 --> 50:02.999
and they tried
to murder him.

50:03.001 --> 50:05.501
Come on!
Who would do such a thing?

50:05.503 --> 50:07.236
Johnny and Cursey!

50:07.238 --> 50:09.672
I don't know!
The Boltons, the Freys,

50:09.674 --> 50:11.007
the High Pigeon.

50:11.009 --> 50:12.208
Could've been anyone.

50:12.210 --> 50:13.576
Maybe even Elay, my sister.

50:13.578 --> 50:15.544
That's outrageous!

50:15.546 --> 50:18.514
Those are all the nice families
you're talking about.

50:18.516 --> 50:21.150
Elay, my sister,
would never hurt a child.

50:21.152 --> 50:22.351
Hodog.

50:26.557 --> 50:29.358
We have to watch our backs,
Deadard.

50:29.360 --> 50:32.395
You never know who would
stab us in the back.

50:32.397 --> 50:34.030
I think you need to rest.

50:34.032 --> 50:36.132
You're becoming paranoid
like the rest of them.

50:36.134 --> 50:38.300
Wait, wait, wait!
Where you going?

50:38.302 --> 50:42.304
I'm going to get
to the bottom of this!

50:49.514 --> 50:54.617
Lord Stork, the king would like
to talk to you in private.

50:54.619 --> 50:58.220
Yes, of course.
I'll be there.

51:03.161 --> 51:05.161
What's happening?
What's happening?

51:10.468 --> 51:12.535
Ham!

51:12.537 --> 51:15.071
You A-hole!

51:15.073 --> 51:16.539
I'm sorry!

51:18.109 --> 51:20.576
Next! Step right up,
step right up!

51:20.578 --> 51:22.578
Who wants to kill
a bastard?

51:26.317 --> 51:28.784
Here, mate.
I'll take those two.

51:30.421 --> 51:32.421
You bastard.

51:33.624 --> 51:36.225
Come on.

51:36.227 --> 51:37.827
I wasn't any good, was I?

51:37.829 --> 51:39.328
I wasn't any good.

51:39.330 --> 51:42.531
I want to fuck!

51:42.533 --> 51:44.366
Hello.

51:44.368 --> 51:47.336
Having a wonderful time here.

51:47.338 --> 51:49.605
Oh, God, I miss your sister.

51:49.607 --> 51:52.641
You know, the old days,
they were beautiful.

51:52.643 --> 51:55.878
Your sister was a real goer.
She was such a partier,

51:55.880 --> 51:58.147
with the little tits
and that ass of hers.

51:58.149 --> 52:00.749
Ah, she was wonderful.
She reminds me of you.

52:00.751 --> 52:03.552
How do you keep your stomach
flat like that?

52:03.554 --> 52:05.821
I have to get on a diet.

52:05.823 --> 52:08.591
I mean, I'm good in bed,
but I'm not like your sister.

52:08.593 --> 52:11.227
She could take 45 people
in one go.

52:11.229 --> 52:14.563
One time I saw her with a
camel with it all in her mouth.

52:14.565 --> 52:18.300
It was quite beautiful
in some horrific kind of way.

52:18.302 --> 52:21.637
Anyway, do you wanna have
a little shot with this one?

52:21.639 --> 52:25.374
Wanna have a little shot?

52:25.376 --> 52:29.845
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
How can I help you, my lord?

52:29.847 --> 52:31.514
What I...

52:31.516 --> 52:33.649
Oh, I do need a favor
from you.

52:33.651 --> 52:35.651
Whatever it is,
you can count on me, my lord.

52:35.653 --> 52:37.219
You're like my brother.

52:37.221 --> 52:39.822
Yes, all right.
Don't interrupt the king.

52:39.824 --> 52:41.757
Now, you know
that I am surrounded

52:41.759 --> 52:44.927
by a bunch of moneygrubbing
ass-licking,

52:44.929 --> 52:48.797
scummy little piggy, alcoholic
people in this kingdom,

52:48.799 --> 52:53.369
and somebody is going to try
and kill me tonight, okay?

52:53.371 --> 52:56.238
Listen, listen,
we already discussed this.

52:56.240 --> 52:57.640
Don't you...

52:57.642 --> 52:59.441
Don't fear the ungrounded.

52:59.443 --> 53:02.545
No one would dare
harm a king.

53:02.547 --> 53:06.582
Okay, well, I happen
to disagree with you,

53:06.584 --> 53:11.287
and therefore I'm going to
command you to protect the realm

53:11.289 --> 53:13.689
for my little
jizzy-wizzy boy,

53:13.691 --> 53:15.891
so he can come and take
all of the things

53:15.893 --> 53:18.727
and have it all, okay?

53:18.729 --> 53:21.564
You can count on me, my lord.
I'll be there.

53:21.566 --> 53:24.233
Okay, thank you.
All right, go on now.

53:24.235 --> 53:28.204
You want to have a little shot?
'Cause I'm gonna go again.

53:29.707 --> 53:31.607
Come here.

53:31.609 --> 53:33.542
Mmm.

53:56.867 --> 53:59.902
That column won't hit back,
you know.

53:59.904 --> 54:01.237
Who are you?

54:01.239 --> 54:04.640
I am a master dancer,

54:04.642 --> 54:06.942
lover,

54:06.944 --> 54:11.380
and the best swordsman
you have ever seen!

54:12.917 --> 54:15.684
My name is Zorrio Furrel.

54:20.424 --> 54:22.891
Oh, the grip is a bit slippery.
Excuse me.

54:22.893 --> 54:24.426
What are you doing here?

54:24.428 --> 54:25.628
Chasing rats!

54:25.630 --> 54:27.563
- Part of your training?
- No.

54:27.565 --> 54:31.600
The rodent situation
in Kingshire is out of hand.

54:31.602 --> 54:32.901
Sword.

54:32.903 --> 54:36.005
Here. Catch this sword.

54:36.007 --> 54:39.575
Looks like your reflexes
could use some practice.

54:39.577 --> 54:41.410
Pick up your weapon.

54:43.347 --> 54:46.849
That is not the way, boy!

54:46.851 --> 54:48.017
I'm a girl.

54:48.019 --> 54:50.719
That cannot be true.
Anyway...

54:50.721 --> 54:54.056
this is how you
pick up a sword.

55:00.931 --> 55:02.031
Ugh!

55:02.033 --> 55:04.800
Ooh! Ooh!

55:04.802 --> 55:08.070
I am just showing you
how not to do it. Ah!

55:08.072 --> 55:13.042
Wouldn't want to knock
yourself in the giggle berries.

55:13.044 --> 55:16.445
I don't have giggle berries.
I'm a girl!

55:24.555 --> 55:27.823
Oh, the sword is all
badly balanced.

55:27.825 --> 55:29.558
Last time.

55:32.663 --> 55:35.364
That is how you do it!

55:35.366 --> 55:38.834
Now get into
the fighting position.

55:41.038 --> 55:43.672
That is not
the fighting position.

55:43.674 --> 55:45.774
Turn to me side-faced!

55:45.776 --> 55:47.409
Sideways.

55:47.411 --> 55:49.912
Yes, that is what I said:
Side-faced.

55:49.914 --> 55:53.415
I have been the first swordsman
of the Bravados for 20 years.

55:53.417 --> 55:55.384
You must listen to me, boy!

55:55.386 --> 55:56.785
I'm a girl!

55:56.787 --> 55:58.121
No way.
Where are your boobies then?

55:58.122 --> 56:00.422
- I'm like ten!
- Very well then.

56:00.424 --> 56:02.424
Turn side-faced!

56:04.362 --> 56:08.130
Good. Now try to strike me.

56:08.132 --> 56:10.132
Ooh! Ooh, you...

56:10.134 --> 56:12.101
I wasn't expecting that.

56:12.103 --> 56:13.469
I'm sorry.

56:13.471 --> 56:14.737
You knocked the wind
out of me.

56:14.739 --> 56:16.939
Let me help you up.

56:16.941 --> 56:21.043
You have to wait for me
to say go, okay?

56:22.413 --> 56:23.479
Go.

56:23.481 --> 56:25.781
Not above the shoulders!

56:25.783 --> 56:27.583
Don't have the proper gear
for that!

56:27.585 --> 56:30.519
You're only supposed to hit me
in this section here.

56:30.521 --> 56:34.990
Follow me.
I will teach you to Fandango!

56:34.992 --> 56:38.861
And then perhaps you will become
a great swordsman like me.

56:46.537 --> 56:47.770
Fandango!

56:52.176 --> 56:54.476
Yeah! There! Olé!

56:54.478 --> 56:55.644
Olé!

57:00.117 --> 57:04.420
Ariana, what in the name of
the Old Guard are you doing?

57:04.422 --> 57:06.555
Zorrio was teaching me
to Fandango.

57:06.557 --> 57:09.525
Zorrio Furrel at your service.

57:09.527 --> 57:11.660
We must go.
Purgefest is about to begin.

57:11.662 --> 57:12.861
Yes, Father.

57:12.863 --> 57:14.563
Keep practicing
and you will go far.

57:14.565 --> 57:17.733
I must go to chase the rats.

57:17.735 --> 57:19.435
Good luck, boy!

57:22.873 --> 57:24.540
Hello, everybody!

57:24.542 --> 57:27.543
It's me, Lord Trumpet,

57:27.545 --> 57:30.779
here at the tremendous
Trumpet Maze.

57:30.781 --> 57:33.449
Everyone loves this maze.
You know why?

57:33.451 --> 57:36.118
Because only white people
can get through it

57:36.120 --> 57:39.588
and brown people get trapped.

57:39.590 --> 57:42.791
Sir! Sir, I'm stuck!
Sir, I need help.

57:42.793 --> 57:45.093
Sir!

57:45.095 --> 57:47.563
Sir, I can't get out! Sir!

57:47.565 --> 57:49.698
Total loser.

57:50.835 --> 57:52.468
Oh, no, Johnny.

57:53.671 --> 57:56.738
Ohh!

57:56.740 --> 58:00.075
What did you do, KK?
Why'd you have to stab him?

58:00.077 --> 58:02.211
- I didn't stab him.
- Yes, you did.

58:02.213 --> 58:04.079
You're a murderer.
Admit it.

58:04.081 --> 58:05.514
I didn't do it.

58:05.516 --> 58:07.182
Okay, if you didn't,

58:07.184 --> 58:08.851
then you did it!

58:10.521 --> 58:12.988
I didn't do it.
I saw you do it.

58:12.990 --> 58:16.091
Me? No! I would never
kill John Doe.

58:16.093 --> 58:18.560
You sure about that?

58:18.562 --> 58:20.596
Oh, no, I did.

58:20.598 --> 58:22.798
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, I did.

58:22.800 --> 58:24.901
Okay, well, let's just get him
into the back room, okay?

58:24.902 --> 58:25.968
Oh, yeah.

58:27.204 --> 58:29.204
- Sam, come on!
- Okay, let's go.

58:29.206 --> 58:30.672
Oh, God.

58:33.143 --> 58:36.545
Eight hundred paces,
and we'll be in Kingshire.

58:36.547 --> 58:41.283
I will be the first female ruler
of all of Wild Westerworld.

58:41.285 --> 58:43.285
My destiny awaits.

58:47.157 --> 58:50.592
Do you have horse heart
by any chance?

58:50.594 --> 58:52.794
Horse heart?
Oh, sure.

58:54.164 --> 58:57.633
- Okay.
- Can you make a sad face?

58:57.635 --> 59:01.637
Okay, let's go this way.

59:01.639 --> 59:03.071
Oh, no.

59:03.073 --> 59:05.741
Oh, Johnny, what do we do?
What do we do?

59:05.743 --> 59:08.043
His clothes, rip them off.

59:08.045 --> 59:09.578
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:09.580 --> 59:11.313
Help, Kocky.

59:11.315 --> 59:12.648
No chance.

59:12.650 --> 59:14.149
Can you get his...

59:16.320 --> 59:18.587
Hello, lady-boys.

59:18.589 --> 59:21.623
Oh, look who it is.
It's the Red Sorceress.

59:21.625 --> 59:23.325
Perhaps she can
bring him back to life.

59:23.327 --> 59:25.861
Uh, that's not
the Red Sorceress.

59:25.863 --> 59:29.298
That's our stepdad,
Trans Jenner.

59:29.300 --> 59:31.567
All right, I'm out.

59:31.569 --> 59:33.302
What's going on?

59:33.304 --> 59:35.671
That man saved us
from the bad people,

59:35.673 --> 59:37.706
and now he's dead

59:37.708 --> 59:40.242
Why are his clothes
coming off?

59:40.244 --> 59:43.145
I just wanted to see
what he looked like naked.

59:43.147 --> 59:45.314
Oh, is that what
you're looking for?

59:45.316 --> 59:48.317
I can just tell you
what it looks like.

59:48.319 --> 59:52.921
Oh, he's so, so warm.

59:52.923 --> 59:54.990
And so, so soft.

59:56.360 --> 59:57.826
Leave the room.

59:57.828 --> 01:00:00.028
I can't make any promises.

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:02.998
I need to work
my jazz fingers.

01:00:07.972 --> 01:00:11.006
- Come on, Clueless.
- No, I... I'm not done!

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:29.191
Ooh!

01:00:47.845 --> 01:00:49.711
At least light a match.

01:00:49.713 --> 01:00:52.748
My sun and my stars...

01:00:56.854 --> 01:01:00.255
May I borrow your ponytail?

01:01:00.257 --> 01:01:03.892
My hair is falling
all over my...

01:01:06.764 --> 01:01:07.896
Aah!

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:12.701
Here.

01:01:12.703 --> 01:01:14.069
Take it.

01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:19.374
Burn him.

01:01:19.376 --> 01:01:20.876
¿Qué?

01:01:20.878 --> 01:01:23.011
Lets go conquer
the Eight Kingdoms.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:24.112
Sorry, buddy.

01:01:27.718 --> 01:01:30.152
Dad, are you gonna be
much longer?

01:01:30.154 --> 01:01:32.821
They just burned a man alive
in the pub.

01:01:32.823 --> 01:01:35.257
I'm just doing some magic.
What do you need?

01:01:35.259 --> 01:01:37.259
Just wanted to make sure
everything is okay!

01:01:37.261 --> 01:01:39.895
Yes, everything is fine!
Just let me finish!

01:01:39.897 --> 01:01:41.697
Okay, I will!

01:02:03.253 --> 01:02:04.786
Ugh!

01:02:05.923 --> 01:02:08.023
My boy!
What has happened?

01:02:08.025 --> 01:02:10.125
Who did this?

01:02:10.127 --> 01:02:11.460
Who are you?

01:02:11.462 --> 01:02:13.495
What are you doing
in my son's room?

01:02:14.965 --> 01:02:16.205
- What's that up there?
- Where?

01:02:21.371 --> 01:02:23.305
That's a funny place
to keep a rabbit.

01:02:23.307 --> 01:02:26.408
Show your face, you coward!
Show your face!

01:02:28.746 --> 01:02:30.445
- Hodog!
- Stay in bed, my boy.

01:02:30.447 --> 01:02:33.982
I will catch the man
who was trying to kill you!

01:02:33.984 --> 01:02:35.517
What happened to me?

01:02:35.519 --> 01:02:37.119
You were dead.

01:02:37.121 --> 01:02:40.255
I just blew you
back to life.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:42.891
You're not gonna
put it in there, are you?

01:02:42.893 --> 01:02:46.027
Too late!

01:02:49.032 --> 01:02:50.532
Who is that?

01:02:50.534 --> 01:02:53.235
That's Summer.
Summer is coming.

01:02:59.009 --> 01:03:01.343
That must be him.

01:03:12.923 --> 01:03:16.191
I don't know how you manage
to do all of us at once.

01:03:16.193 --> 01:03:18.894
You're a true master.

01:03:18.896 --> 01:03:23.198
If I told you my secret,
I'd have to kill you both.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.367
Ooh! Right.

01:03:25.369 --> 01:03:27.335
So close your eyes now.
Come on.

01:03:27.337 --> 01:03:30.505
Both of you, close your eyes.
That's it.

01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:41.316
You can open them now!

01:03:43.253 --> 01:03:45.821
Your time is up, troll!
You're coming with us!

01:03:45.823 --> 01:03:46.888
Where to?

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:48.423
Grab him.

01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:50.025
Excuse me.

01:03:54.131 --> 01:03:56.298
- Put me down, you shit!
- Come on, troll!

01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:00.468
Wait, I didn't get a chance
to punch my frequent doer card.

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:03.405
Ah, keep it
in your pants, troll.

01:04:03.407 --> 01:04:04.407
Tell me brother!

01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:17.485
Hodog. Hodog!

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:20.322
Please, look, please!

01:04:20.324 --> 01:04:23.091
Git! Come on, come on!

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:48.350
Ooh!

01:04:48.352 --> 01:04:50.619
Please, look, please.

01:04:50.621 --> 01:04:52.420
We have to be reasonable
about this here.

01:04:52.422 --> 01:04:54.022
If you explain what it is
that you want,

01:04:54.024 --> 01:04:55.891
I'm sure we can sort it.

01:04:55.893 --> 01:04:58.027
If I'm not at the Purgefest
in the next couple of hours,

01:04:58.028 --> 01:05:00.161
all my family is gonna
come looking for me!

01:05:01.498 --> 01:05:02.530
Why'd you do it?

01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:04.165
Why did I do what?

01:05:07.204 --> 01:05:09.271
Why did you do it?

01:05:09.273 --> 01:05:11.339
If you explain to me
what it is that I did,

01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:13.575
perhaps I can tell you
why I did it!

01:05:13.577 --> 01:05:15.277
Ooh! Aah!

01:05:21.451 --> 01:05:24.419
Ah, bloody hell.

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:28.156
I think I'm chafing
from all the walking already.

01:05:28.158 --> 01:05:30.659
Oh, John,
you wouldn't happen to have

01:05:30.661 --> 01:05:33.161
some of that oil
you put on your hair

01:05:33.163 --> 01:05:35.163
to rub on my thighs,
would you?

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:40.702
- Oh!
- What? What is it?

01:05:40.704 --> 01:05:42.237
Is the flash too bright?

01:05:42.239 --> 01:05:44.272
No, no.
We need to get out of here.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:48.076
There is no way
I'm leaving this party early.

01:05:48.078 --> 01:05:50.045
Stop, stop, stop.

01:05:50.047 --> 01:05:53.148
Look, I know the future,
and shit's about to pop off.

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:57.485
Quick, take a photo of me
holding the statue's tiny penis.

01:05:57.487 --> 01:06:00.021
Okay, how's that?

01:06:00.023 --> 01:06:02.090
Do I look like I'm holding it?

01:06:02.092 --> 01:06:03.525
Yeah, right on it.

01:06:03.527 --> 01:06:05.427
Is that small enough?

01:06:05.429 --> 01:06:06.594
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:06:16.106 --> 01:06:17.172
Stop!

01:06:18.241 --> 01:06:20.742
Guys!

01:06:20.744 --> 01:06:22.110
I just farted.

01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:23.979
Down. Quiet.

01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:26.081
Seriously, it's like
a Dutch oven in here.

01:06:26.083 --> 01:06:27.649
Ooh, grapes. Mmm!

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:30.051
Can't be discovered.

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:32.721
- More grapes, more grapes!
- Shh!

01:06:32.723 --> 01:06:34.156
Where is your mother
and your brother?

01:06:34.157 --> 01:06:36.458
Purgefest is about to begin.

01:06:41.765 --> 01:06:45.633
Welcome
to Purgefest 2... 3000.

01:06:48.005 --> 01:06:50.005
For as long
as I can remember,

01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:52.007
my kingdom has been, uh...

01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:55.377
Well, it's been known for its
sexual perversions, isn't it?

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.180
And for its corruption.

01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:03.351
Violence, its betrayals,
and its bloodshed.

01:07:05.088 --> 01:07:07.522
We're gonna put an end
to all that.

01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:11.126
There's gonna be
no more raping

01:07:11.128 --> 01:07:14.396
and no more killing
around here.

01:07:14.398 --> 01:07:16.564
We're gonna hand in
our smartphones

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:18.500
'cause I don't want
no more pornography.

01:07:18.502 --> 01:07:21.169
And were gonna hand in
all of our weapons,

01:07:21.171 --> 01:07:23.104
and I mean everything.

01:07:23.106 --> 01:07:25.273
I mean no more
kitchen knives,

01:07:25.275 --> 01:07:27.375
no more forks,
nothing you can do nothing with.

01:07:31.448 --> 01:07:34.315
Didn't they read
the invite?

01:07:34.317 --> 01:07:36.518
Most of the people
in our kingdom

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.553
are illiterate, my lord.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:41.489
They just heard there was
free food and a party.

01:07:41.491 --> 01:07:46.327
I have the king
just where I want him.

01:07:46.329 --> 01:07:49.397
Now, after just a little
manipulation

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:51.800
of Johnny Bang Bang,

01:07:51.802 --> 01:07:57.539
then it's just a matter of time
before I mount the throne.

01:07:57.541 --> 01:07:58.706
Enough!

01:07:58.708 --> 01:08:01.609
I'm the fucking king!

01:08:01.611 --> 01:08:04.779
And I declare
that anyone participating

01:08:04.781 --> 01:08:08.383
in these violent activities

01:08:08.385 --> 01:08:12.187
is gonna be expelled
from the Eight Kingdoms.

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:17.591
What?

01:08:17.594 --> 01:08:19.627
The Storks have kidnapped
my little brother.

01:08:19.629 --> 01:08:21.429
I demand he be released
immediately.

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.865
Wait a minute. No, I mean,
you told me this morning

01:08:23.867 --> 01:08:27.202
you wanted that little fella
punished, didn't you?

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:29.537
Yes. I despise him.

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:31.606
But he is still
my little brother.

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:35.810
I can't allow a Stork to kidnap
someone with my own blood.

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:40.548
If they don't return him
to us immediately,

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:42.684
you must ban them
from the Eight Kingdoms,

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:46.688
according to the declaration
you just made.

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:53.394
Come on,
you wretched scuzzball.

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:56.663
Gonna get you already.
Hold still!

01:08:56.666 --> 01:08:57.899
Speak, troll!

01:08:57.901 --> 01:09:02.270
Meet your gods as an honest man!
Confess!

01:09:02.272 --> 01:09:03.837
Never! Oww!

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:06.174
All right, I confess,
I confess.

01:09:06.176 --> 01:09:07.709
I choked him,

01:09:07.711 --> 01:09:09.678
and I slapped him all around
the floor till he bled.

01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:12.313
- I'm an evil man!
- Who are you talking about?

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.182
The Lord Commander
of the Southern Forces.

01:09:14.184 --> 01:09:15.617
He's here!

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:17.819
In my pants.
Would you like to meet him?

01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:19.754
Tell me the truth.

01:09:19.756 --> 01:09:21.456
All right, all right,
I confess.

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:23.892
I'm the reason why
all the dragons are extinct.

01:09:23.894 --> 01:09:26.728
I screwed them all
into their extinction.

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:29.596
I built the wall
with my wank hammer.

01:09:29.599 --> 01:09:32.300
I stabbed a crazy king
with my flesh saber.

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:36.203
That's enough!
You tried to kill my son!

01:09:36.206 --> 01:09:38.840
Oh, well, why would I
want to kill your son?

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.942
I don't know!
You tell me!

01:09:40.944 --> 01:09:42.609
Ohh!

01:09:44.481 --> 01:09:47.549
What, no more wax?

01:09:54.724 --> 01:09:56.925
Yes! I got you!

01:09:58.795 --> 01:10:01.963
Hodog, Hodog, Hodog.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:04.632
Hodog!

01:10:07.571 --> 01:10:09.270
Oh, shit.

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:13.808
What was that?

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:16.578
The king into fireworks?
What the fuck is that?

01:10:19.683 --> 01:10:24.552
Well, I guess we know...

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:28.756
what happened
to the dragonfire now.

01:10:28.758 --> 01:10:31.292
You check it out.
I'll take care of the troll.

01:10:31.294 --> 01:10:32.894
Yes, Mother.

01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:34.729
Ohh. Ooh, ooh!

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:37.599
You're turning me on, you...

01:10:37.601 --> 01:10:40.935
Now we will have to find
some other way to kill the king.

01:10:40.937 --> 01:10:43.571
Whoever did this
must have known our plans.

01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:45.306
Bobb, where's your mother?

01:10:45.308 --> 01:10:47.809
She has the troll. She's trying
to make him confess.

01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:50.678
You must tell her to bring him
to the feast immediately,

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.581
or our entire family's gonna be
banned from the Eight Kingdoms!

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:55.416
Yes, Father, I shall go now.

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:57.986
This was the work
of a true genius.

01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:06.694
Yes!

01:11:06.696 --> 01:11:08.429
I did it!

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:09.897
I got the bone!

01:11:09.899 --> 01:11:12.634
I am the dragon master!

01:11:21.945 --> 01:11:24.712
- How are you guys?
- This is so much fun.

01:11:24.714 --> 01:11:26.614
Commander.

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:29.317
I've come to help.

01:11:29.319 --> 01:11:31.819
John, I thought
you were at the wall.

01:11:31.821 --> 01:11:33.788
I heard you were
in trouble, Father.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.757
Who told you
we might be in trouble?

01:11:35.759 --> 01:11:36.791
My friend Ham.

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:38.726
Ham?

01:11:38.728 --> 01:11:41.329
The fat guy?

01:11:45.302 --> 01:11:47.502
No, just one bite.

01:11:47.504 --> 01:11:49.537
No.

01:11:49.539 --> 01:11:51.072
No, I'm...

01:11:51.074 --> 01:11:52.573
Come on.

01:11:52.575 --> 01:11:57.011
Deadard, where is the troll?

01:11:57.013 --> 01:12:00.348
I know nothing about the troll.
I swear it to it!

01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:01.849
He's lying. Look at him.

01:12:01.851 --> 01:12:03.584
Release him at once

01:12:03.586 --> 01:12:07.388
or be banished
from the kingdom, my brother.

01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:09.023
Bros before ho's.

01:12:09.025 --> 01:12:10.758
Here he is, Your Grace.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:14.829
This troll
tried to murder my son.

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:16.030
That's not true!

01:12:16.032 --> 01:12:18.366
- I'm innocent!
- Ugh!

01:12:18.368 --> 01:12:21.636
That's a very low thing
that you did there, troll.

01:12:21.638 --> 01:12:24.672
I'm gonna have to
cut you down to size.

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:26.607
Since you're in the arena,

01:12:26.609 --> 01:12:30.445
I demand a trial by...
twerking.

01:12:40.557 --> 01:12:42.123
What's twerking?

01:12:42.125 --> 01:12:44.625
Allow me, Your Grace,
to defend my family's honor.

01:12:44.627 --> 01:12:46.894
No, bastard.
As the firstborn,

01:12:46.896 --> 01:12:48.996
I shall defend
my mother's honor.

01:12:48.998 --> 01:12:51.132
The two of you, sit down.

01:12:51.134 --> 01:12:54.736
I am the one who must
defend my wife's honor.

01:12:54.738 --> 01:12:55.937
Hey!

01:12:55.939 --> 01:12:58.740
I will twerk the troll
to death!

01:12:58.742 --> 01:12:59.974
Wait a second!

01:12:59.976 --> 01:13:01.642
You're four times
the size of me!

01:13:01.644 --> 01:13:04.145
I demand a champion.
I have the right!

01:13:04.147 --> 01:13:06.681
Well, who's your champion
going to be?

01:13:08.017 --> 01:13:11.486
I name my nephew,
Jizzy Lays-my-sister.

01:13:11.488 --> 01:13:12.987
Let's see him twerk!

01:13:12.989 --> 01:13:14.956
I can't twerk.
I'm just... a dick.

01:13:16.526 --> 01:13:18.826
Ha! About time
you admitted it.

01:13:18.828 --> 01:13:19.861
Right.

01:13:19.863 --> 01:13:22.997
I choose... Hodog!

01:13:24.634 --> 01:13:25.767
Hodog.

01:13:36.112 --> 01:13:37.112
Show him, Dad!

01:13:45.088 --> 01:13:46.921
- Help!
- Yep, yep.

01:13:46.923 --> 01:13:47.923
Not yet.

01:13:52.495 --> 01:13:54.629
I do not wish
to continue this battle.

01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:58.866
I will spare Hodog's life
and let the troll live.

01:13:58.868 --> 01:14:01.602
I demand nothing in return.

01:14:04.207 --> 01:14:06.073
He was my friend.

01:14:06.075 --> 01:14:09.076
He could've been somebody,
instead of a bum.

01:14:11.181 --> 01:14:15.917
Deadard, no!

01:14:19.923 --> 01:14:21.155
Die!

01:14:21.157 --> 01:14:26.694
I... want... you...
to... die!

01:14:31.134 --> 01:14:33.568
My own wife.

01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:37.004
My own beautiful wife.

01:14:37.006 --> 01:14:39.006
What happened to you?

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:44.479
Jizzy is not your son.

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:53.988
Yeah, but he really looks
just like me.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.723
I'm king.

01:14:55.725 --> 01:14:58.926
I'm king!

01:14:58.928 --> 01:15:01.863
Yes, son, of course you're king.
You're king.

01:15:07.904 --> 01:15:09.737
I'm king.

01:15:09.739 --> 01:15:10.938
And you're mine.

01:15:13.576 --> 01:15:15.776
Okay, guards,
kill all the Storks.

01:15:15.778 --> 01:15:17.578
Kill them all!
Kill everyone!

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:19.080
Wait! Except Sansia.

01:15:19.082 --> 01:15:21.582
I want to give her
a pearl necklace and a foot rub.

01:15:30.527 --> 01:15:32.693
That's it. Shh.

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:52.880
You want some, do ya?
Do ya?

01:16:01.257 --> 01:16:04.191
That's it. Shh.

01:16:08.765 --> 01:16:10.598
Hey, come here,
you little bastard!

01:16:14.837 --> 01:16:17.672
Go back to the wall!

01:16:19.842 --> 01:16:21.309
Die!

01:16:44.167 --> 01:16:46.033
Hodog!

01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:52.740
Hodog! Hodog!

01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:09.156
Who wants to see
a magic trick?

01:17:11.928 --> 01:17:14.695
I'm melting!

01:17:14.697 --> 01:17:16.364
Melting!

01:17:16.366 --> 01:17:18.766
Melting, melting!

01:17:29.178 --> 01:17:33.748
This is Trumpet Arena,
the greatest arena in the world!

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:35.182
I own it!

01:17:35.184 --> 01:17:37.385
I strongly advise you
to leave the area, sir.

01:17:37.387 --> 01:17:40.087
I am so sick of you, Miller.

01:17:40.089 --> 01:17:41.656
You don't know anything!

01:17:41.658 --> 01:17:44.125
But I just want
to protect you, sir.

01:17:44.127 --> 01:17:46.127
We could've
made America great again.

01:17:46.129 --> 01:17:47.194
Idiot!

01:17:47.196 --> 01:17:51.065
People of Wild Westerworld,

01:17:51.067 --> 01:17:54.235
- I've done everything for you,
- Dragon Bone.

01:17:54.237 --> 01:17:56.237
And all I ask in return

01:17:56.239 --> 01:17:59.674
is that you capture
that woman

01:17:59.676 --> 01:18:02.043
and grab her by the pussy.

01:18:02.045 --> 01:18:04.812
Grab her by the pussy!

01:18:15.925 --> 01:18:17.358
Oh, man!

01:18:29.806 --> 01:18:32.807
Well, if it isn't John Doe.

01:18:32.809 --> 01:18:35.309
How's the life
of an inbred prince?

01:18:35.311 --> 01:18:37.978
It's going great. How's life
in your Mexican gardener?

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:39.146
Let's go, princess.

01:18:43.853 --> 01:18:46.287
Hello, princess.

01:18:46.289 --> 01:18:47.855
Killed another Mexican.

01:19:12.749 --> 01:19:15.750
I told you motherfuckers
y'all was gonna die.

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.459
Yippee!

01:19:25.461 --> 01:19:27.461
The throne is mine!

01:19:29.198 --> 01:19:33.033
The goddamn throne...

01:19:33.035 --> 01:19:34.435
is mine!

01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:37.772
Whoa!

Good evening.
It's Piff, the magic dragon.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:33.254
I'm here with one of the...

01:21:33.256 --> 01:21:35.890
Well, the sole funder,
actually, of this movie,

01:21:35.892 --> 01:21:39.260
Mr. Donald J. Trump.

01:21:39.262 --> 01:21:42.162
Yes, Donald J. Trump.
The J is for John.

01:21:42.164 --> 01:21:45.099
For John?
I thought it was for Jesus.

01:21:45.101 --> 01:21:46.667
So you produced
<i>Purge of Thrones,</i>

01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:48.535
and you're
one of the characters.

01:21:48.537 --> 01:21:50.671
Tell us, how did you
audition for the role?

01:21:50.673 --> 01:21:52.606
Uh, good question.

01:21:52.608 --> 01:21:56.143
This is the skin I shedded
like a snake,

01:21:56.145 --> 01:21:57.978
at least three weeks ago.

01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:00.648
We're here with two of
our lovely cast members.

01:22:00.650 --> 01:22:02.316
Would you like
to introduce yourselves?

01:22:02.318 --> 01:22:05.519
First of all,
I'm just lovely without "this."

01:22:05.521 --> 01:22:07.655
- What's this?
- You did it.

01:22:07.657 --> 01:22:11.025
Yeah, "lovely."
I was just emphasizing it.

01:22:11.027 --> 01:22:12.193
You said you had
a penis voice.

01:22:12.194 --> 01:22:13.394
What's your penis voice?

01:22:13.396 --> 01:22:16.196
My penis voice
is a little deep.

01:22:16.198 --> 01:22:18.365
How's it going, Mum?

01:22:18.367 --> 01:22:20.935
Living the
Mother of Dragons dream.

01:22:20.937 --> 01:22:22.636
What is that dream?

01:22:22.638 --> 01:22:25.072
Uh, conquering
the Eight Kingdoms.

01:22:25.074 --> 01:22:27.374
- Eight Kingdoms?
- Yeah, I think.

01:22:27.376 --> 01:22:29.543
And what are these kingdoms?

01:22:29.545 --> 01:22:33.213
Gosh, I don't know.

01:22:33.215 --> 01:22:34.715
Does it really matter?

01:22:34.717 --> 01:22:36.283
Apparently not.

01:22:38.187 --> 01:22:40.187
- Do you want some?
- Yeah.

01:22:44.493 --> 01:22:47.428
So tell us about
<i>Purge of Thrones.</i>

01:22:50.499 --> 01:22:52.533
Are you gonna have
the whole thing or...

01:22:52.535 --> 01:22:56.170
Yeah, I'm a growing dragon.

01:22:56.172 --> 01:22:58.272
This is the castle
they've given me to reside in

01:22:58.274 --> 01:23:00.140
for the rest of my life.

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:02.210
They originally thought
it was to the end of the shoot,

01:23:02.211 --> 01:23:04.512
but actually I took out a word
and replaced it with "life."

01:23:04.513 --> 01:23:06.981
So this is now
my genuine castle.

01:23:06.983 --> 01:23:08.649
Some of it is on flames, yep.

01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:11.018
We just put some of it on fire.

01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:13.554
We got about 20 minutes before
that place burns to the ground,

01:23:13.556 --> 01:23:16.256
and we lose yet another
English heritage site.

01:23:16.258 --> 01:23:18.692
During the process,
what moments led you

01:23:18.694 --> 01:23:21.762
to feel most in tune
with yourself on set?

01:23:21.764 --> 01:23:23.664
- Whiskey.
- Whiskey, great.

01:23:23.666 --> 01:23:25.599
- Oh, my gosh.
- You were great. Good job.

01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:27.101
Thank you very much.

01:23:31.273 --> 01:23:33.140
Can I get some cake?

01:23:33.142 --> 01:23:35.743
What is it that you enjoy most
about <i> Purge of Thrones?</i>

01:23:35.745 --> 01:23:39.179
Well, obviously everyone
'cause everyone's been great.

01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:41.015
Most people
just say the money.

01:23:41.017 --> 01:23:43.617
No, because
I'm not gonna get paid.

01:23:43.619 --> 01:23:45.586
Yeah, I'm just
hanging around here.

01:23:45.588 --> 01:23:48.288
Guess it's how they afford
everyone else's exorbitant fees.

01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:49.723
Exactly.

01:23:49.725 --> 01:23:52.659
How am I supposed to answer
serious questions

01:23:52.661 --> 01:23:54.695
to a man who's
dressed like this?

01:23:54.697 --> 01:23:56.664
- I'm a genuine magic dragon.
- It's just not going to work.

01:23:56.665 --> 01:23:58.599
I'm directing this,
I wrote this,

01:23:58.601 --> 01:24:00.401
and I'm funding this.

01:24:00.403 --> 01:24:02.336
This is gonna be
the biggest film

01:24:02.338 --> 01:24:04.538
in the history of film since,
what, the <i> Titanic,</i>

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.240
which is huge.

01:24:06.242 --> 01:24:08.542
But this is gonna sweep
the Academy Awards next year.

01:24:08.544 --> 01:24:10.044
Just sweep it.

01:24:10.046 --> 01:24:13.080
We're gonna make purging
great again.

01:24:13.082 --> 01:24:14.415
No one purges like me.
No one!

01:24:14.417 --> 01:24:16.150
- Make purging great again?
- Yes.

01:24:16.152 --> 01:24:18.185
That's what we're going for.

01:24:18.187 --> 01:24:21.288
I don't think I'm getting paid
enough gold for this, guys.

01:24:21.290 --> 01:24:25.325
All of this is lies.
It's a bunch of crap. It's crap.

01:24:25.327 --> 01:24:28.062
These guys are losers.
They're lightweights.

01:24:28.064 --> 01:24:30.364
They're nobodies.
They don't know me.

01:24:30.366 --> 01:24:31.799
They don't know
how great I am.

01:24:31.801 --> 01:24:35.769
All that they do is spread
disinformation about me.

01:24:35.771 --> 01:24:39.840
I'm so sick of watching
this crap every single night.

01:24:39.842 --> 01:24:41.308
They don't know me.

01:24:41.310 --> 01:24:42.577
They don't know
how tremendous I am.

01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:44.445
They don't know
how fantastic I am,

01:24:44.447 --> 01:24:47.314
what a great guy I am,
what a great businessman I am.

01:24:47.316 --> 01:24:49.316
This is all just fake news!

01:24:49.318 --> 01:24:52.419
Every single night
is just fake news about me!

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:54.755
And I'm a really,
really nice guy,

01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:57.157
and I shouldn't be
picked on like this!

01:24:57.159 --> 01:24:58.425
Pence!
