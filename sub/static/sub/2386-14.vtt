00:01.661 --> 00:03.796
Hey, guys.
Where are Marshall and Lily?

00:03.798 --> 00:05.714
Something terrible
happened.

00:05.716 --> 00:07.516
Are they okay?
Are they in the hospital?

00:07.518 --> 00:08.784
No.

00:08.786 --> 00:12.821
Somewhere much... much worse.

00:12.823 --> 00:14.056
Long Island!

00:14.058 --> 00:15.557
Tonight, we're moving
out there for good.

00:15.559 --> 00:19.111
Yeah. Here are your spare
keys to our new house.

00:19.113 --> 00:20.512
Long Island?

00:20.514 --> 00:21.897
I don't understand.

00:21.899 --> 00:24.099
You can get spray tans here.

00:24.101 --> 00:25.184
ROBIN:
I never let myself

00:25.186 --> 00:27.319
believe this day
would really come.

00:27.321 --> 00:28.570
It's like when
they canceled

00:28.572 --> 00:30.856
<i>Party of Five</i>
for the second time.

00:31.825 --> 00:35.844
I mean when they...
canceled sports.

00:35.846 --> 00:38.647
Guys, we'll still see
each other all the time,

00:38.649 --> 00:40.148
and we'll talk
on the phone.

00:40.150 --> 00:42.201
And I know people say
that having kids means

00:42.203 --> 00:43.702
you won't see your
friends anymore, but...

00:43.704 --> 00:45.254
Oh, God, this is
good-bye, isn't it?

00:45.256 --> 00:46.622
No. Stop it.

00:46.624 --> 00:47.873
Guys, this doesn't

00:47.875 --> 00:49.124
change anything.

00:49.126 --> 00:52.378
We are only a 46-minute
train ride away.

00:52.380 --> 00:53.512
Just pop out

00:53.514 --> 00:54.847
whenever you want.

00:54.849 --> 00:57.716
So... I guess
this seat is open.

00:57.718 --> 00:59.935
(whimpering)

00:59.937 --> 01:01.937
I'll go get a chair.

01:04.057 --> 01:05.391
So that's it.

01:05.393 --> 01:06.842
No more Marshall.

01:06.844 --> 01:07.893
No more Lily.

01:07.895 --> 01:09.511
They're gone.

01:09.513 --> 01:11.513
Which means...

01:11.515 --> 01:14.182
no lame married couple

01:14.184 --> 01:16.902
shooting down
all my amazing ideas.

01:16.904 --> 01:18.987
Guys, great news.

01:18.989 --> 01:21.964
I'm the new leader
of the gang!

NARRATOR: <i>Marshall and Lily were almost</i>
<i>done decorating their new home.</i>

01:38.225 --> 01:39.925
I like it there much better.
Yeah.

01:39.927 --> 01:41.042
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

01:41.044 --> 01:42.594
MICKEY:
Wrong!

01:42.596 --> 01:45.046
This can't go here.

01:45.048 --> 01:47.149
<i>Kids, when he found out</i>
<i>she was pregnant,</i>

01:47.151 --> 01:48.717
<i>Lily's estranged father</i>

01:48.719 --> 01:50.903
<i>unexpectedly showed up</i>
<i>on her doorstep.</i>

01:50.905 --> 01:52.905
<i>It was a gesture</i>
<i>she appreciated.</i>

01:52.907 --> 01:55.591
<i>But after two weeks,</i>
<i>they'd had just about enough.</i>

01:55.593 --> 01:56.942
That has to go there

01:56.944 --> 01:58.827
to cover up
the splintery floorboard.

01:58.829 --> 01:59.778
And you can't hang

01:59.780 --> 02:01.196
this picture here.

02:01.198 --> 02:03.665
This isn't plaster;
it's dried toothpaste.

02:04.584 --> 02:07.436
Guys, you're so lucky I'm here.

02:07.438 --> 02:09.121
I grew up in this house.

02:09.122 --> 02:11.573
I know it like
the back of my hand.

02:11.575 --> 02:14.293
And this lamp
absolutely cannot be here.

02:14.295 --> 02:16.044
Why not?

02:16.046 --> 02:18.180
Blocks my view
of the Widow Rodriguez

02:18.182 --> 02:20.349
doing her Jane Fonda workouts.

02:20.351 --> 02:22.267
Isn't she
a little old, Dad?

02:22.269 --> 02:25.254
Oh, you didn't see her
when I was a kid.

02:25.256 --> 02:28.457
In my mind, she'll always be 54.

02:31.194 --> 02:34.279
I know he means well, but
I can't take it anymore.

02:34.281 --> 02:36.097
He won't leave,
and-and he's acting

02:36.099 --> 02:37.933
like this is his house.
No, I know.

02:37.935 --> 02:40.452
And these annoying notes
he keeps leaving around?

02:40.454 --> 02:43.155
"I need absolute silence
when practicing the drums."

02:43.157 --> 02:46.107
"Do not touch the fudge
in my nightstand."

02:46.109 --> 02:48.794
"We need ant traps
for my nightstand."

02:48.796 --> 02:51.446
I find myself
hiding out here

02:51.448 --> 02:53.415
just because it's the only room
in the house

02:53.417 --> 02:54.583
where he can't boss us around.

02:54.585 --> 02:55.801
MICKEY (over intercom):
Great news.

02:55.803 --> 02:58.286
I put new batteries
in the old intercom system.

02:58.288 --> 03:00.472
Now we can communicate
at all times.

03:00.474 --> 03:02.641
Mickey out.

03:03.626 --> 03:06.011
Look at what's become
of our booth.

03:06.013 --> 03:08.347
Looks like my old
shop teacher's hand--

03:08.349 --> 03:10.999
just sort of
missing something.

03:11.001 --> 03:12.734
Enough!

03:12.736 --> 03:15.153
I am sick of you two
wallowing in sadness,

03:15.155 --> 03:16.772
instead of doing
the healthy thing

03:16.774 --> 03:18.574
and pretending
anyone who leaves you

03:18.576 --> 03:21.026
never existed
in the first place.

03:21.028 --> 03:22.494
I hate to agree with Barney's

03:22.496 --> 03:23.645
near-paralyzing
abandonment issues,

03:23.647 --> 03:25.030
but he has a point.

03:25.032 --> 03:26.198
You can't just stop living

03:26.200 --> 03:27.983
because two of your friends
moved away.

03:27.985 --> 03:29.368
Precisely.

03:29.370 --> 03:33.205
Now, as new group leader,
I say we go out and do something

03:33.207 --> 03:35.624
that we never would have done
with Marshall and Lily here.

03:35.626 --> 03:37.042
Ooh.

03:37.044 --> 03:41.880
Remember that amazing idea
I had that one time?

03:41.882 --> 03:44.666
Let's go to a strip club.
Nope.

03:44.668 --> 03:46.635
So what do you say?

03:46.637 --> 03:49.337
Let's declare
our independence

03:49.339 --> 03:52.941
with an on-da-peen dance.

03:55.111 --> 03:56.395
On-the-peen dance.

03:56.397 --> 03:57.896
No, we got it.
We got it.

03:57.898 --> 03:59.180
Let's go to a strip club!

03:59.182 --> 04:00.232
TED:
Well...

04:00.234 --> 04:01.516
I'm going to miss
them anywhere.

04:01.518 --> 04:03.652
Might as well see some
cans while I'm at it.

04:03.654 --> 04:04.853
I'll take it!

04:04.855 --> 04:06.622
Robin, Kevin, you in?

NARRATOR: <i>Kids, early in any</i>
<i>relationship,</i>

04:09.493 --> 04:12.194
<i>there's a phase where you don't</i>
<i>say no to anything.</i>

04:12.196 --> 04:14.930
<i>Because you want</i>
<i>to seem interesting...</i>

04:14.932 --> 04:17.298
<i>adventurous...</i>

04:17.301 --> 04:19.051
<i>and open-minded.</i>

04:19.053 --> 04:21.168
<i>I call it</i>
<i>Early Relationship Chicken.</i>

04:21.171 --> 04:23.388
Well, I'm open
to anything.

04:23.390 --> 04:25.841
Oh, mos' def.

04:25.843 --> 04:27.709
So...
So...

04:27.711 --> 04:30.062
<i>I don't want to go</i>
<i>to a strip club.</i>

04:30.064 --> 04:31.597
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to go to a strip club.</i>

04:31.599 --> 04:33.815
<i>But I don't want him</i>
<i>to think I'm some prude.</i>

04:33.817 --> 04:36.935
<i>Man, we've been saying "so"</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

04:36.937 --> 04:38.937
Yeah!
Yeah!

04:38.939 --> 04:40.272
(both grunt)

04:40.274 --> 04:41.440
Yes!

04:41.442 --> 04:44.159
Tonight is going
to be legen--

04:44.161 --> 04:46.445
(imitating Lily): Wait, are we sure it's a
good idea to go to a strip club?

04:46.447 --> 04:50.332
Shut up, Lily!
I'm in charge now-- dary!

04:52.051 --> 04:53.669
I've got no
cell reception.

04:53.671 --> 04:55.287
I wanted to call Ted.

04:55.289 --> 04:56.371
This feels weird.

04:56.373 --> 04:58.073
The last time I lived
this far from him

04:58.075 --> 04:59.124
was my semester abroad.

04:59.126 --> 05:01.126
You never did a semester abroad.

05:01.128 --> 05:02.577
That's what I called it
when we lived

05:02.579 --> 05:04.446
on opposite sides of campus.

05:04.448 --> 05:06.465
Wrong!

05:06.467 --> 05:08.317
Please tell me you're not
plugging that in there.

05:08.319 --> 05:11.303
Yes, Mickey,
that's exactly what I'm doing.

05:11.305 --> 05:12.921
All right, fine.
I won't say anything.

05:12.923 --> 05:15.440
It's... just that
this was my room

05:15.442 --> 05:16.758
when I growing up,

05:16.760 --> 05:18.977
so I know it a little
better than you.

05:18.979 --> 05:21.763
Lot of great memories here.

05:21.765 --> 05:24.483
Mostly just discovering my body.

05:25.401 --> 05:26.702
That's it.

05:26.704 --> 05:28.036
Mickey, since you got here,

05:28.038 --> 05:30.322
you've been nothing
but judgmental and pushy

05:30.324 --> 05:33.075
and strangely obsessed
with your adolescent sex life.

05:33.077 --> 05:34.326
Tomorrow morning,

05:34.328 --> 05:36.111
you're out of here.

05:36.113 --> 05:38.279
Well, I-I've just been trying
to help you...

05:38.281 --> 05:39.715
We don't need your help!

05:43.469 --> 05:45.286
I...
(door closes)

05:45.288 --> 05:46.972
Oh, it-it's okay, baby.

05:46.974 --> 05:48.807
It had to be done.

05:49.642 --> 05:51.860
(sighs)

05:52.795 --> 05:54.029
(electrical buzzing)

05:54.031 --> 05:55.163
(beep)

05:55.165 --> 05:56.765
MICKEY (over intercom):
Too bad the one person

05:56.767 --> 05:58.633
who could stop you
from making mistakes like that

05:58.635 --> 06:00.502
was told he has to move out
next month.

06:00.504 --> 06:03.338
Tomorrow!
Tomorrow!

06:04.424 --> 06:06.474
Would either of you
like a dance?

06:07.527 --> 06:09.111
(stammering)

06:09.113 --> 06:10.612
I'm always ready to rock.

06:10.614 --> 06:13.448
(chuckles)
And I'm always ready to roll.

06:13.450 --> 06:15.784
So...
So...

06:15.786 --> 06:18.003
<i>I'm not ready to rock.</i>

06:18.005 --> 06:20.172
<i>Rolling makes me dizzy.</i>

06:22.008 --> 06:23.792
Hell, yeah!
Yeah!

06:23.794 --> 06:26.845
I'm buying my man a lap dance,
'cause that's just how I do!

06:26.847 --> 06:28.496
Party like a
rock star!

06:28.498 --> 06:30.615
(trailing off):
Party like a rock star...

06:30.617 --> 06:32.217
TED:
Uh, hey, guys.

06:32.219 --> 06:33.468
It's Ted.

06:33.470 --> 06:35.170
Um... you're probably busy
with the move still.

06:35.172 --> 06:36.438
Um...

06:36.440 --> 06:39.391
Give me a call
if you want to gab.

06:39.393 --> 06:41.727
Sorry about using
the word "gab."

06:41.729 --> 06:44.062
Ted, stop pining
over Marshall and Lily.

06:44.064 --> 06:45.981
Have some self-respect.

06:45.983 --> 06:48.516
Now, put this fiver
in your mouth so...

06:48.518 --> 06:50.518
that stripper with the lazy eye
can vacuum it up with...

06:50.520 --> 06:51.737
Barney!
Wh-what?

06:51.739 --> 06:53.121
I'm allowed to miss them, okay?

06:53.123 --> 06:54.456
They're my two best friends.

06:54.458 --> 06:55.957
I'm your two best friends!

06:56.859 --> 06:58.126
And we're here tonight

06:58.128 --> 07:00.695
to show you there's no need
to miss something

07:00.697 --> 07:03.298
when you can replace it
with something better.

07:03.300 --> 07:06.134

NARRATOR: <i>So, a while back, we discovered</i>
<i>the most amazing thing:</i>

07:22.352 --> 07:23.851
<i>Lily had a doppelganger</i>

07:23.853 --> 07:27.388
<i>who was a Russian stripper.</i>

07:27.390 --> 07:28.923
Look at her, Ted.

07:28.925 --> 07:30.608
She's just like old,

07:30.610 --> 07:31.692
less-good Lily,

07:31.694 --> 07:33.027
but instead of
bossing us around,

07:33.029 --> 07:34.278
she shows us her boobs.

07:34.280 --> 07:35.846
No touching.

07:35.848 --> 07:38.149
Okay, a little
bossing us around.

07:38.151 --> 07:40.151
I call her Better Lily.

07:40.153 --> 07:43.538
Hey, Better Lily, please
dance for my friend.

07:43.540 --> 07:45.873
Barney, I don't
need a lap dance.

07:45.875 --> 07:48.326
I need to talk
to my friends.

07:48.328 --> 07:50.694
Who says you
can't do both?

07:50.696 --> 07:52.380
Talk to her.
She's got ears.

07:52.382 --> 07:54.531
Yes, she does have ears.

07:54.533 --> 07:56.584
You want to touch my
girlfriend's boobs?

07:56.586 --> 07:58.052
50 bucks.

07:58.054 --> 08:01.722
Wait-- Better Lily
is dating this behemoth?

08:01.724 --> 08:03.841
Sound like anyone
you know?

08:03.843 --> 08:05.542
That's New Marshall.

08:06.478 --> 08:08.946
This is our gang now.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.560
Hey, guys, Ted again.

08:23.562 --> 08:25.896
Starting to think
you forgot about me.

08:25.898 --> 08:27.999
Or replaced me
with some cool neighbor.

08:28.001 --> 08:29.450
What's his name?!

08:29.452 --> 08:31.235
(chuckling):
I'm totally kidding.

08:31.237 --> 08:32.787
Anyway, uh...

08:32.789 --> 08:34.755
just trying to remember
what your faces look like.

08:34.756 --> 08:36.674
Ted, when they serve alcohol
at a strip club,

08:36.676 --> 08:38.376
you're not allowed
to show your vagina.

08:38.378 --> 08:41.596
100 bucks, and you
will see the world, my friend.

08:41.597 --> 08:43.881
They're already
ignoring my calls?

08:43.883 --> 08:45.433
Look, I'm realistic.

08:45.435 --> 08:48.185
I knew I'd have to get used
to going to the dentist alone,

08:48.187 --> 08:50.054
but I didn't think
they'd cut me out completely.

08:50.056 --> 08:51.055
If they don't

08:51.057 --> 08:53.140
need us, we don't need them.

08:53.142 --> 08:54.942
Yes! Finally!

08:54.944 --> 08:57.812
By the way, did you see
how she opened that bottle?

09:00.198 --> 09:01.666
Whoa.

09:01.668 --> 09:04.585
Lights out in the suburbs
is... is really dark.

09:04.587 --> 09:05.936
MARSHALL:
Where's the fuse box?

09:05.938 --> 09:07.238
LILY:
I don't know.

09:07.240 --> 09:08.155
(beep)

09:08.157 --> 09:10.074
(singsongy):
I know where it is.

09:10.076 --> 09:13.744
Maybe I could fix it for you,
if I wasn't so busy packing.

09:13.746 --> 09:15.112
MARSHALL:
You know what?

09:15.114 --> 09:17.114
I bet the fuse box
is in the basement.

09:17.116 --> 09:18.633
I'll just... I'll go
find it myself.

09:18.635 --> 09:19.967
How hard can it be?

09:19.969 --> 09:21.135
(Marshall groans)

09:21.137 --> 09:23.387
As hard as that desk
you just walked into?

09:23.389 --> 09:25.589
(guffawing)

09:27.009 --> 09:28.592
Good burn, Mickey.

09:28.594 --> 09:31.562
You deserve a little
nightstand fudge for that one.

09:31.564 --> 09:32.963
KEVIN:
<i>Where do I look?</i>

09:32.965 --> 09:34.649
<i>I mean, I can't look</i>
<i>at her chest.</i>

09:34.651 --> 09:36.017
<i>Damn it! I just did.</i>

09:36.019 --> 09:37.818
<i>Maybe Robin didn't notice.</i>

09:37.820 --> 09:40.637
<i>Man, he's really up</i>
<i>in those jugs.</i>

09:41.690 --> 09:42.990
Shake it, baby!

09:42.992 --> 09:44.808
A playa's gotta play!

09:44.810 --> 09:46.277
<i>This is weird.</i>

09:46.279 --> 09:48.579
<i>I'll just look her</i>
<i>in the eyes.</i>

09:48.581 --> 09:52.333
<i>Is he falling in love</i>
<i>with this stripper?</i>

09:52.335 --> 09:53.650
<i>Quick, do something cool.</i>

09:54.503 --> 09:56.037
Make it rain, son!

09:56.039 --> 09:57.338
Money ain't no thang!

09:57.340 --> 10:01.258
<i>Damn it,</i>
<i>there was a 20 in there.</i>

10:04.012 --> 10:06.213
(chimes tinkling)

10:08.133 --> 10:10.000
MICKEY (over intercom):
Hello, Mr. Eriksen.

10:10.002 --> 10:11.602
From the sound
of the wind chimes,

10:11.604 --> 10:13.854
I hear you've made it
to the first floor.

10:13.856 --> 10:15.940
Okay... you know what, Mickey?

10:15.942 --> 10:19.643
You can save the creepy
game master routine.

10:19.645 --> 10:22.563
It's only kind of
terrifying me.

10:22.565 --> 10:25.032
Oh, but the game has just begun.

10:25.034 --> 10:27.851
I call it "Try Not to Bang into
All the Furniture and Stuff

10:27.853 --> 10:32.356
on Your Way to the Fuse Box
in the Basement, Marshall."

10:32.358 --> 10:34.625
That's just a working title.

10:34.627 --> 10:36.127
Hey!

10:36.129 --> 10:39.080
Got a little boob glitter
on your eyebrow, Mac Daddy.

10:39.082 --> 10:41.031
Straight pimpin'.

10:41.033 --> 10:43.134
Barney, you got
a little bit, too.

10:43.136 --> 10:45.386
Where?

10:46.922 --> 10:48.055
Did I get it?

10:48.057 --> 10:49.206
Yeah, you got it.

10:49.208 --> 10:50.808
Who needs Marshall
and Lily?

10:50.810 --> 10:52.727
We got a new gang,

10:52.729 --> 10:55.312
and we're all going to
hang out together forever.

10:55.314 --> 10:56.764
My shift is done.

10:56.766 --> 10:57.932
Good-bye.

10:57.934 --> 10:59.550
Wait, stop!

10:59.552 --> 11:02.052
Technically, this song's not
over, so we still own you.

11:02.054 --> 11:04.155
Plus we're best friends!

11:04.740 --> 11:05.940
Where to next?

11:05.942 --> 11:07.441
We go to underground
poker game

11:07.443 --> 11:09.777
in mostly-abandoned
insane asylum.

11:09.779 --> 11:11.445
Yes!

11:11.447 --> 11:13.531
This is gonna be awesome,

11:13.533 --> 11:15.549
and when it is, I want
you all to remember

11:15.551 --> 11:17.868
who led you there:
Barney Stinson,

11:17.870 --> 11:19.754
new group leader.

11:30.098 --> 11:31.515
(giggles)
Yay!

11:31.517 --> 11:34.751
I'm winning all
your chippies!

11:36.221 --> 11:37.772
Let's not drink
when we're...

11:37.774 --> 11:38.773
I'm thirsty; it's good.

11:38.775 --> 11:40.107
It's good.

11:40.109 --> 11:41.525
(intercom beeps)

11:41.527 --> 11:42.977
LILY (over intercom):
Marshall, I just remembered

11:42.979 --> 11:46.030
I saw a box of matches
in the drawer by the trash can.

11:46.032 --> 11:48.232
Okay, thanks, baby.

11:55.190 --> 11:57.374
Lily, I can't find them.

11:57.376 --> 11:59.710
Looking for these?

11:59.712 --> 12:01.662
(evil chuckle over intercom)

12:01.664 --> 12:03.464
Oh, right, you can't see me.

12:03.466 --> 12:07.384
Um, well, I'm burning the
matches you so desperately need.

12:07.386 --> 12:09.453
(evil laugh)

12:11.056 --> 12:13.274
Aah, ooh, ow!

12:13.276 --> 12:15.142
(over intercom):
Ow.

12:15.144 --> 12:16.177
Hah! Oh!

12:16.179 --> 12:17.344
(laughs)

12:17.346 --> 12:20.130
Mickey... guess who found
the basement stairs?

12:20.132 --> 12:22.466
I'll be down
at that fuse box in no time,

12:22.468 --> 12:24.801
and when I get there,

12:24.803 --> 12:27.971
I'm sure that I'll figure out
how fuse boxes work,

12:27.973 --> 12:29.306
so it'll be fine.

12:29.308 --> 12:30.658
MICKEY (muffled):
Hey, Marshall,

12:30.660 --> 12:32.910
I know I've been
messing with you,

12:32.912 --> 12:35.312
but seriously,
that second step, don't...

12:35.314 --> 12:37.414
I don't want to hear it, Mickey.

12:37.416 --> 12:38.532
(yells)

12:38.534 --> 12:41.752
(yelling and crashing)

12:42.370 --> 12:43.420
Oh, my knee!

12:43.422 --> 12:44.371
(cymbals crash)

12:44.373 --> 12:45.372
Ow!

12:45.374 --> 12:48.592
(sighs)
And watch out for my drum set.

12:50.512 --> 12:52.179
I win again!

12:52.181 --> 12:53.430
I was bluffing.

12:53.432 --> 12:55.316
I didn't even have enough cards.

12:58.053 --> 13:00.003
Ted, please stop winning.

13:00.005 --> 13:02.556
Hey, look, it's the
New York City skyline.

13:02.558 --> 13:04.558
♪ We built Chip City

13:04.560 --> 13:05.693
Uh, uh!

13:05.695 --> 13:09.029
♪ We built Chip City
on all your dough ♪

13:09.031 --> 13:11.398
♪ Built Chip City
Hit it!

13:11.400 --> 13:13.617
(high-pitched whine)

13:17.343 --> 13:19.343
You know Butterfly-knife.

13:19.376 --> 13:22.378
I'd expect this
from Face Tattoo...

13:22.380 --> 13:24.197
or Jagged Cheek Scar,

13:24.199 --> 13:26.933
or Larry,

13:26.935 --> 13:27.767
but not you.

13:27.769 --> 13:29.668
Why don't I get nickname?

13:29.670 --> 13:31.137
Because you have too
many things, Larry.

13:31.139 --> 13:32.355
You get one thing!

13:32.357 --> 13:33.973
(squeals)

13:33.975 --> 13:38.177
(speaking Russian)

13:38.179 --> 13:41.347
See, that's why
you bring New Marshall.

13:41.349 --> 13:44.350
(high-pitched laugh)

13:47.454 --> 13:50.356
We go to party in
slaughterhouse.

13:50.358 --> 13:51.858
You come?

13:52.409 --> 13:54.293
<i>Please, God, no.</i>

13:54.295 --> 13:59.499
(sobbing): <i>Don't let me be in charge</i>
<i>of the gang anymore.</i>

13:59.501 --> 14:01.918
<i>I can't believe Dr. Kevin</i>
<i>doesn't remember me</i>

14:01.920 --> 14:04.387
<i>from our sessions</i>
<i>three years ago.</i>

14:04.389 --> 14:05.505
<i>Is that the lunatic</i>

14:05.507 --> 14:07.890
<i>that stabbed</i>
<i>all those prison guards?</i>

14:07.892 --> 14:10.092
<i>We gotta hit that party!</i>

14:10.094 --> 14:11.427
(quietly):
<i>I'll never find love.</i>

14:11.429 --> 14:13.712
We got to hit that party!

14:13.714 --> 14:15.982
BOTH (weakly):
Sweet.

14:16.900 --> 14:18.851
Lily?

14:18.853 --> 14:22.438
I think we made a mistake
moving out to the suburbs.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.407
I miss our home.

14:24.409 --> 14:27.360
I miss our booth
with our friends.

14:27.362 --> 14:29.328
(cymbal crashes)

14:29.330 --> 14:33.082
And I'm pretty sure I have
a drumstick...

14:33.084 --> 14:35.735
somewhere bad.

14:35.737 --> 14:38.070
Dad, why are you
acting like this?

14:38.072 --> 14:40.239
Well, I was just
trying to be helpful,

14:40.241 --> 14:42.625
but you guys want me out
by the Fourth of July.

14:42.627 --> 14:43.676
Tomorrow.

14:43.678 --> 14:44.594
(sighs)

14:44.596 --> 14:46.512
You know what
a helpful father,

14:46.514 --> 14:48.965
not to mention grandfather,
might do?

14:48.967 --> 14:51.517
Get these lights back on.

14:53.253 --> 14:55.855
(sighs quietly)

14:55.857 --> 14:56.922
(intercom beeps)

14:56.924 --> 14:58.558
Okay, Marshall, listen up.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.643
I'm gonna get you
to that fuse box.

15:00.645 --> 15:03.646
Can't you just come down here
and do it for me, please?

15:03.648 --> 15:05.698
I don't know anything
about this house.

15:05.700 --> 15:06.899
No, Marshall...

15:06.901 --> 15:10.152
you don't know anything
about <i>your</i> house.

15:13.457 --> 15:16.609
All right, we got a lot
of work to do.

15:16.611 --> 15:19.328
Wait here,
we get you

15:19.330 --> 15:21.614
on VPI list for party.

15:21.616 --> 15:25.134
You give us, uh,
$200 per person.

15:25.136 --> 15:26.335
Cover charge.

15:26.337 --> 15:28.754
That's pretty steep
for a cover charge.

15:28.756 --> 15:30.923
Is very good party.

15:30.925 --> 15:35.828
Is party for, uh, New York
"Yunkees" and Coca-Cola.

15:35.830 --> 15:37.179
Oh, my God.

15:37.181 --> 15:39.181
A Coca-Cola Yankees party?

15:39.183 --> 15:41.400
That sounds like a real thing.

15:44.021 --> 15:46.672
Okay, now, Marshall,
take three steps forward,

15:46.674 --> 15:49.775
while ducking underneath
the broken ceiling fan.

15:50.911 --> 15:52.011
Now look to your left

15:52.013 --> 15:54.030
and spit.

15:54.032 --> 15:55.531
(spits, sizzles)

15:55.533 --> 15:56.666
That's the water heater.

15:56.668 --> 15:58.117
Want to stay away from that.

15:58.119 --> 16:02.371
That baby is hotter than the
Widow Rodriguez in a unitard.

16:02.373 --> 16:06.509
Okay, now past the washer and
dryer is the hardest part.

16:06.511 --> 16:09.845
You're gonna have to belly-crawl
underneath the ping-pong table

16:09.847 --> 16:11.764
and don't so much as nudge it.

16:11.766 --> 16:12.848
Why not?

16:12.850 --> 16:15.685
Because there are
900 dominos set up

16:15.687 --> 16:17.520
in the shape of Barbara Eden.

16:17.522 --> 16:20.139
Big, big <i>I Dream Of Jeannie</i> fan.

16:24.194 --> 16:25.144
I'm clear.

16:25.146 --> 16:26.612
(thud, dominos falling)

16:28.649 --> 16:30.616
(dominos continue falling)

16:30.618 --> 16:33.235
I don't know what
that sound is, Mickey.

16:33.237 --> 16:35.354
That's the sound of Barbara
Eden never banging me.

16:35.356 --> 16:36.405
That's what that is.

16:36.407 --> 16:38.324
Dad, get it back.

16:38.326 --> 16:41.460
(quietly):
Come on.

16:41.462 --> 16:44.046
(beep)
Okay, Marshall,

16:44.048 --> 16:45.748
take three steps forward,

16:45.750 --> 16:48.167
and you should be
at the fuse box.

16:48.169 --> 16:50.336
Do you think he made it?

16:53.924 --> 16:55.558
I did it!

16:55.560 --> 16:57.009
No, Marshall...

16:57.011 --> 16:59.228
<i>you</i> did it.

17:01.682 --> 17:03.683
NARRATOR:
<i>Fun fact: that night inspired</i>

17:03.685 --> 17:05.851
<i>Mickey's one and only</i>

17:15.463 --> 17:18.364
MICKEY:

17:18.366 --> 17:20.700
Well, judging from
how many clients

17:20.702 --> 17:22.568
that hooker has serviced,

17:22.569 --> 17:24.170
I'd say we've been
here almost an hour.

17:24.172 --> 17:26.288
Ted, we've been robbed.

17:26.290 --> 17:29.408
Better Lily and New Marshall
would never rob us.

17:29.410 --> 17:31.327
They're our best friends.

17:31.329 --> 17:32.628
(squealing)

17:32.630 --> 17:35.798
(speaking Russian)

17:36.767 --> 17:38.417
Damn it, Ted.

17:38.419 --> 17:40.886
New Marshall is
an escaped zoo bear

17:40.888 --> 17:44.190
and the only thing that Better
Lily is better at than our Lily

17:44.192 --> 17:45.891
is over-the-pants hand stuff.

17:45.893 --> 17:48.260
I'm assuming.

17:48.262 --> 17:49.445
I'll admit it.

17:49.447 --> 17:50.946
I can't lead this group.

17:50.948 --> 17:52.732
We need Marshall and Lily.

17:52.734 --> 17:54.600
But they're gone, aren't they?

17:54.602 --> 17:57.069
I mean, it'll go from seeing
them a couple times a week,

17:57.071 --> 17:58.871
to a couple times a month,

17:58.873 --> 18:01.207
and then it'll just
be holiday parties.

18:01.908 --> 18:04.076
Then the years pass,

18:04.078 --> 18:05.745
and you find out
Marshall's dead,

18:05.747 --> 18:08.297
and you're there for Lily
emotionally at first,

18:08.299 --> 18:11.617
but then it becomes sexual,
and you feel guilty,

18:11.619 --> 18:14.587
but maybe that guilt just makes
it dirtier and better...

18:14.589 --> 18:15.954
No, I won't let that happen.

18:15.956 --> 18:17.506
Especially that last part.

18:18.675 --> 18:21.126
Look, I know I've been a little
drunk and naive tonight,

18:21.128 --> 18:22.178
but here's what's gonna happen.

18:22.180 --> 18:23.512
First, we're gonna leave a note

18:23.514 --> 18:25.564
for Better Lily and Arvydas,
they're worriers.

18:25.566 --> 18:27.016
Oh, buddy.
Then,

18:27.018 --> 18:29.769
we're gonna go see Only Marshall
and One-Of-A-Kind Lily

18:29.771 --> 18:31.136
because they're our best friends

18:31.138 --> 18:32.471
and they're only
46 minutes away.

18:32.473 --> 18:33.739
Are you with me?

18:33.741 --> 18:36.025
Kind of resent the power grab,
but okay, let's go!

18:36.027 --> 18:37.142
Hey,

18:37.144 --> 18:38.994
do you want to come to
Long Island with us?

18:38.996 --> 18:42.448
Uh, well, still a few more
hours before the sun comes up.

18:42.450 --> 18:44.166
BOTH:
So...

18:44.168 --> 18:45.751
No.
No?

18:45.753 --> 18:46.652
Is that bad?

18:46.654 --> 18:49.371
(exhales)
No, it's great.

18:49.373 --> 18:50.840
Ooh, that felt so good.

18:50.842 --> 18:53.158
I hate doing things
and going anywhere!

18:53.160 --> 18:54.426
Oh, new experiences suck!

18:54.428 --> 18:55.628
(laughing)

18:55.630 --> 18:57.847
While we're at it,
I hate high-fiving you!

18:57.849 --> 18:59.014
I know.

18:59.016 --> 19:00.382
We're adults who are
sleeping together,

19:00.384 --> 19:02.218
not teens pledging a frat.

19:06.973 --> 19:10.392
<i>Oh, man, I really</i>
<i>liked the high-five.</i>

19:10.394 --> 19:14.680
NARRATOR: <i>The next morning, Marshall</i>
<i>and Lily woke up to a surprise.</i>

19:14.682 --> 19:17.867
(wind chimes clatter)

19:20.787 --> 19:23.772
Hey, what are... what
are you guys doing here?

19:23.774 --> 19:28.160
Just wanted to make
sure this key worked.

19:28.162 --> 19:30.529
(sighs)
We missed you.

19:30.531 --> 19:32.631
Give mama a hug.

19:33.717 --> 19:35.701
ALL:
Oh...

19:35.703 --> 19:37.469
Don't check your voicemail.

19:37.471 --> 19:39.255
Y-You might have
a couple weird ones.

19:39.257 --> 19:40.890
You hear this?!

19:40.892 --> 19:42.992
This is the sound
of me moving on.

19:42.994 --> 19:45.010
(whooping)

19:45.012 --> 19:46.395
(giggles)

19:47.831 --> 19:52.101
Yeah, I'm a stripper.

19:52.103 --> 19:55.137
Okay, who wants pancakes?

19:55.139 --> 19:56.438
(gasps)

19:56.440 --> 19:59.441
Which two of you want pancakes?

19:59.443 --> 20:00.576
I'll make more.

20:00.578 --> 20:01.610
Oh, good-good-good,
'cause I want pancakes.

20:01.612 --> 20:02.695
There you go.

20:02.697 --> 20:03.946
Thank you, okay.

20:03.948 --> 20:05.381
Enjoy them.

20:05.383 --> 20:07.149
Hey, honey, look,

20:07.151 --> 20:08.617
I'm sorry I was a jerk before.

20:08.619 --> 20:11.003
Okay? I'll leave
right after breakfast.

20:11.005 --> 20:12.671
I'll crash with some friends.

20:12.673 --> 20:14.123
Dad, you know what?

20:14.125 --> 20:15.407
You can stay.

20:15.409 --> 20:16.258
Oh, thank God.

20:16.260 --> 20:18.243
I got no friends.

20:18.245 --> 20:20.095
I'll be here two weeks, tops.

20:20.097 --> 20:23.132
NARRATOR:
<i>It wasn't two weeks.</i>

20:23.134 --> 20:24.917
<i>Would the five</i>
<i>of us always live</i>

20:24.919 --> 20:26.852
<i>within a few minutes</i>
<i>of that booth?</i>

20:26.854 --> 20:30.845
<i>No, that's life, kids,</i>
<i>but here's what I discovered.</i>

20:31.923 --> 20:34.340
<i>Our booth was wherever</i>
<i>the five of us were together.</i>

20:41.177 --> 20:42.861
That's right, Widow Rodriguez.

20:42.863 --> 20:44.196
Stretch it.

20:44.198 --> 20:45.847
Work those gams.

20:45.849 --> 20:47.716
Ooh, yeah.

20:47.718 --> 20:49.401
Grab that left arm.

20:49.403 --> 20:51.703
Clutch that chest.

20:51.705 --> 20:54.249
Fall down really fast.

20:54.514 --> 20:57.003
Oh, my God!
Somebody call 911!
