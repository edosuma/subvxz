<i>I never thought</i>
<i>That I could be so satisfied</i>

00:58.807 --> 01:02.334
<i>Every time that I look in your angel eyes</i>

01:02.511 --> 01:07.210
<i>A shock inside me</i>
<i>That words just can't describe</i>

01:07.382 --> 01:09.976
<i>And there's no explaining</i>

01:10.152 --> 01:13.883
<i>Something in the way you move</i>
<i>I can't deny</i>

01:14.056 --> 01:17.548
<i>Every word from your lips is a lullaby</i>

01:17.726 --> 01:20.320
<i>A twist of fate makes life worthwhile</i>

01:20.495 --> 01:23.089
<i>You are gold and silver</i>

01:24.933 --> 01:27.993
<i>I said I wasn't gonna lose my head</i>

01:28.170 --> 01:32.573
- <i>But then pop goes my heart</i>
- <i>Pop goes my heart</i>

01:32.741 --> 01:35.574
<i>I wasn't gonna fall in love again</i>

01:35.744 --> 01:39.874
- <i>But then pop goes my heart</i>
- <i>Pop goes my heart</i>

01:40.048 --> 01:45.008
<i>And I just can't let you go</i>

01:45.187 --> 01:48.020
<i>I can't lose this feeling</i>

01:48.190 --> 01:50.852
<i>These precious moments</i>
<i>We have so few</i>

01:51.026 --> 01:55.622
<i>Let's go far away</i>
<i>Where there's nothing to do but play</i>

01:55.797 --> 02:00.359
<i>You've shown to me</i>
<i>That my destiny's with you</i>

02:00.535 --> 02:02.799
<i>And there's no explaining</i>

02:03.572 --> 02:06.132
<i>I said I wasn't gonna lose my head</i>

02:06.308 --> 02:10.972
- <i>But then pop goes my heart</i>
- <i>Pop goes my heart</i>

02:11.146 --> 02:13.774
<i>I wasn't gonna fall in love again</i>

02:13.949 --> 02:17.612
- <i>But then pop goes my heart</i>
- <i>Pop goes my heart</i>

02:17.786 --> 02:22.985
<i>And I just can't let you go</i>

02:23.158 --> 02:26.286
<i>I can't lose this feeling</i>

02:38.306 --> 02:40.570
<i>A twist of fate makes life worthwhile</i>

02:40.742 --> 02:45.179
<i>You are gold and silver</i>

02:45.347 --> 02:48.180
<i>I said I wasn't gonna lose my head</i>

02:48.350 --> 02:52.684
- <i>But then pop goes my heart</i>
- <i>Pop goes my heart</i>

02:52.854 --> 02:56.312
<i>I wasn't gonna fall in love again</i>

02:56.491 --> 02:59.688
- <i>But then pop goes my heart</i>
- <i>Pop goes my heart</i>

02:59.861 --> 03:01.089
<i>And I just</i>

03:01.363 --> 03:06.198
<i>Can't let you go</i>

03:08.470 --> 03:10.836
<i>PoP was one of the biggest bands</i>
<i>of the '80s...</i>

03:11.006 --> 03:13.600
<i>...but today they're known</i>
<i>as Colin Thompson's old group.</i>

03:13.775 --> 03:16.767
<i>Colin, or as he's been dubbed</i>
<i>by the queen, "Sir Colin"...</i>

03:16.945 --> 03:20.278
<i>...has gone on to sell millions of records,</i>
<i>star in blockbuster films...</i>

03:20.449 --> 03:23.145
<i>...and create his own cologne,</i>
<i>"A Whiff of Colin."</i>

03:23.318 --> 03:24.580
<i>But here's a question:</i>

03:24.753 --> 03:28.120
<i>Can you remember the name</i>
<i>of the other guy in PoP?</i>

03:28.290 --> 03:31.282
<i>Whatever happened to Alex Fletcher?</i>

03:31.893 --> 03:35.886
<i>Tonight we find out</i>
<i>on</i> Battle of the '80s Has-Beens <i>.</i>

03:37.666 --> 03:40.601
We think it's gonna be bigger
than <i>American Idol</i>.

03:40.769 --> 03:42.236
So, what do you think, Alex?

03:42.404 --> 03:43.530
Well, I love it.

03:43.705 --> 03:47.641
It's brilliant on so many levels,
I don't even know where to start.

03:47.809 --> 03:48.798
Good for you.

03:48.977 --> 03:51.104
Because some of the people
we've approached...

03:51.279 --> 03:55.147
...have had a little problem
with the term "has-been."

03:55.317 --> 03:56.306
Have they? Have they?

03:56.485 --> 04:00.854
You see, I don't share that.
I am a happy has-been. Really.

04:01.022 --> 04:03.252
It's a very clear statement:
"I live in the past.

04:03.425 --> 04:05.325
Everything good I ever did
was long ago.

04:05.494 --> 04:07.826
Don't expect anything
new or exciting from me now."

04:07.996 --> 04:10.863
Really takes the pressure off.
Especially on a first date.

04:11.032 --> 04:12.397
Good for you.

04:13.235 --> 04:15.601
So we've already taped several shows...

04:15.770 --> 04:18.034
...and we're going to start
airing them this week.

04:18.206 --> 04:20.868
And some of the performers
include REO Speedwagon...

04:21.041 --> 04:22.873
- Speedwagon.
- ...Flock of Seagulls...

04:23.044 --> 04:24.204
The Flock? Okay.

04:24.379 --> 04:26.108
- ...Debbie Gibson, Tiffany...
- Debbie.

04:27.115 --> 04:30.346
- History there.
- ...and Frankie Goes to Hollywood.

04:30.519 --> 04:33.454
So "Relax."

04:33.989 --> 04:35.889
Nice one.

04:36.057 --> 04:38.617
Good. Okay. Worthy adversaries, all.

04:38.793 --> 04:41.489
And how many songs
would I actually get to perform?

04:41.663 --> 04:43.290
I'd like to do two, you know?

04:43.465 --> 04:45.695
A ballad and then maybe
a more up-tempo number...

04:45.867 --> 04:48.358
...where I get to shake it a bit.

04:48.537 --> 04:53.099
I can't promise any of the acts
that they'll be singing.

04:53.808 --> 04:57.744
Sorry? Confused.
What would we be doing, then?

04:58.280 --> 04:59.907
Boxing.

05:01.383 --> 05:05.615
That's why the show is called
<i>Battle of the '80s Has-Beens</i>.

05:05.787 --> 05:09.814
Only the winner gets to sing.

05:16.665 --> 05:19.327
Right, right, right. Got you.

05:25.373 --> 05:27.170
- Afternoon, Mr. Fletcher.
- Hello, Willy.

05:27.342 --> 05:28.331
Have a good day.

05:28.510 --> 05:30.444
Yes, well, enjoyed it so far.

05:31.746 --> 05:34.237
- All right. There he is.
- Oh, my manager.

05:34.416 --> 05:37.112
All right, listen,
I had no idea they meant boxing.

05:37.285 --> 05:39.082
Nobody said a word to me, I swear.

05:39.254 --> 05:42.189
No, it's not a problem.
I can definitely take Flock of Seagulls.

05:42.357 --> 05:46.350
We did a tour with them in '89 and we beat
them severely. They cried like little girls.

05:46.528 --> 05:50.123
All right, listen. It's my fault
and I hate myself for it, but I'm not upset.

05:50.298 --> 05:51.959
And do you know why?

05:52.133 --> 05:53.657
You've been at my liquor.

05:53.835 --> 05:55.132
Because of her.

05:56.838 --> 05:59.136
Cora Corman.
Biggest star in the world.

05:59.307 --> 06:01.673
Bigger than Britney and Christina
put together.

06:01.843 --> 06:05.108
And guess who she loves.

06:05.280 --> 06:06.372
Her country?

06:07.249 --> 06:12.551
You. She's a huge PoP fan
and she wants to meet you, Alex.

06:12.721 --> 06:14.655
Hang on, hang on.

06:16.658 --> 06:17.647
Khan, I've missed you.

06:17.826 --> 06:19.851
<i>Alex, I have Sophie here for you.</i>

06:20.028 --> 06:21.620
That sounds like fun. Who is she?

06:21.796 --> 06:24.094
<i>She's here to do your plants.</i>

06:24.266 --> 06:25.426
But Jane does my plants.

06:25.600 --> 06:29.468
<i>She can be in and out in five minutes,</i>
<i>and this is really the best time for her.</i>

06:29.638 --> 06:31.833
It seems she cannot be stopped.
Send her up.

06:32.507 --> 06:34.634
So start again. Cora Corman...

06:34.809 --> 06:37.835
Why do you have a plant lady?
Why do you even have plants?

06:38.413 --> 06:40.313
Because from time to time...

06:40.482 --> 06:42.609
...ladies accompany me
back to the apartment...

06:42.784 --> 06:45.582
...and one once mentioned
that plants make women comfortable.

06:45.754 --> 06:48.587
Is that true?
Plants make women comfortable?

06:48.757 --> 06:51.590
Well, maybe if I had plants
I'd still be married.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.421
Yes, I think that was the problem.

06:53.595 --> 06:55.586
Not Susan's affair
and raging nymphomania...

06:55.764 --> 06:57.698
...but your lack of vegetation.

06:59.301 --> 07:00.700
Hang on.

07:05.907 --> 07:08.671
- Hi, I'm Sophie Fisher.
- I'm Alex Fletcher.

07:08.843 --> 07:12.040
- You didn't get the message from Jane?
- No. I haven't listened to my--

07:12.213 --> 07:14.773
She was supposed to let you know
I'd be doing plants.

07:15.317 --> 07:17.478
Very nice. Lovely. Well, come on in.

07:17.652 --> 07:18.710
Thank you.

07:18.887 --> 07:22.823
I hope you have your own watering can.
Jane told me that everyone had their own.

07:22.991 --> 07:27.121
But this last guy, Mr. Werther, about 80,
he didn't have his own watering can...

07:27.295 --> 07:30.264
...so he starts yelling at me
and screaming at me in German:

07:31.900 --> 07:33.868
I'm fluent enough
to know what he's saying.

07:34.035 --> 07:36.970
You haven't been cursed at
till you've been cursed at in German.

07:37.138 --> 07:39.299
I know what you mean.
I dated a frÃ¤ulein once.

07:40.241 --> 07:44.200
Plant stuff is in the kitchen under the sink.
And I have my own can.

07:44.379 --> 07:46.643
Oh, well, <i>vielen Dank</i>.

07:47.115 --> 07:49.777
Hi, I'm Chris Riley, Alex's manager.

07:49.951 --> 07:52.920
Oh, Sophie Fisher. Nice to meet you.

07:54.255 --> 07:56.587
So kitchen?

07:56.758 --> 07:58.953
- Yeah.
- Great.

08:00.195 --> 08:02.891
So Cora Corman, huh?
How great is that? Do you believe it?

08:03.064 --> 08:06.591
All right, wait, wait, wait.
Is it even a good idea? Pros and cons.

08:06.768 --> 08:11.467
Pros: She's a huge star,
great publicity, terrific money.

08:12.474 --> 08:13.634
Cons?

08:13.808 --> 08:16.436
No matter what you do,
in 40 years we'll both be dead.

08:16.611 --> 08:20.274
Okay. Huge star, great publicity,
terrific money versus eventual death.

08:20.448 --> 08:22.075
I think we have to think about it.

08:22.250 --> 08:24.650
Okay, good, because Cora
is shooting a video tonight.

08:24.819 --> 08:27.287
- She wants to meet both of us right after.
- Tonight?

08:27.455 --> 08:28.649
- Tonight?
- Yes, tonight.

08:30.825 --> 08:32.383
You all right?

08:33.227 --> 08:36.025
Do you have a Band-Aid
and antibiotic cream?

08:36.197 --> 08:40.030
No, no. And sadly,
I think I've lent out my iron lung.

08:40.201 --> 08:41.293
Okay.

08:41.469 --> 08:44.836
Well, then I'm gonna go because,
you know, this could get infected.

08:45.006 --> 08:48.806
And it's not clotting yet, but, I mean,
I'm a little hypochondriacal.

08:48.977 --> 08:51.605
You just-- You can never be too careful.

08:51.780 --> 08:53.975
Anyway, I'll come back and finish.

08:54.149 --> 08:56.982
So come again. I mean, you live here.
I'll come again.

08:57.152 --> 08:58.642
I'm gonna go get this looked at.

08:58.820 --> 09:02.688
You should really have a first-aid kit.
Thank you. Have a good night. I'll see you.

09:05.593 --> 09:06.753
Weird.

09:06.928 --> 09:09.556
- Don't give her a key.
- No.

09:09.731 --> 09:11.460
So you said something about tonight.

09:11.633 --> 09:13.624
Tonight we meet Cora.

09:19.207 --> 09:21.437
<i>I've got to have my Buddha's delight</i>

09:21.609 --> 09:24.203
<i>Om shanti, shanti</i>

09:24.379 --> 09:26.404
<i>I've got to have my Buddha's delight</i>

09:26.581 --> 09:29.379
<i>Om shanti, shanti</i>

09:30.819 --> 09:32.081
<i>I want a revelation</i>

09:33.188 --> 09:34.883
<i>And sweet salvation</i>

09:35.056 --> 09:37.047
<i>And the eternal fire</i>

09:37.225 --> 09:39.523
<i>Show me the eternal fire</i>

09:41.229 --> 09:43.356
<i>Like sitting meditation</i>

09:43.898 --> 09:46.128
<i>You give me elevation</i>
<i>Can you take me higher?</i>

09:46.301 --> 09:48.735
She seems like a very spiritual kid.

09:48.903 --> 09:52.100
Yeah. It's nice to see
a young woman exploring religion.

09:58.680 --> 10:03.049
<i>I'm not satisfied if I don't get</i>

10:03.218 --> 10:06.016
<i>My Buddha's delight</i>

10:10.191 --> 10:11.385
And cut.

10:12.894 --> 10:14.486
Terrific.

10:16.097 --> 10:18.122
- Hey, I'm Ray, Cora's manager.
- Chris Riley.

10:18.299 --> 10:19.823
- Nice to meet you.
- Alex Fletcher.

10:20.001 --> 10:21.434
- Great to meet you.
- Hi, Ray...?

10:21.603 --> 10:24.663
Just Ray. Cora's this way, come on.
Follow me.

10:27.075 --> 10:30.044
C, this is Alex Fletcher
and his manager, Chris Riley.

10:30.211 --> 10:33.305
- We loved the video. It was unbelievable.
- Yeah.

10:33.481 --> 10:36.917
You know, I wish I brought my daughter.
She worships you.

10:37.085 --> 10:40.213
I'm divorced. But that's another story.

10:43.625 --> 10:45.718
Mr. Fletcher, it's a pleasure.

10:47.295 --> 10:51.664
Your song "Dance With Me Tonight" got me
through my parents' divorce when I was 7.

10:51.833 --> 10:52.959
Really? Wow.

10:53.134 --> 10:56.103
Yeah, because I recorded that
when I was 9, so... Yeah.

10:56.271 --> 11:00.571
I want my fans to know the same
spiritual uplift that your music gave me.

11:00.742 --> 11:04.109
That would be lovely. I have a few tunes
it would be nice to update.

11:04.279 --> 11:07.874
Oh, I don't live in the past, Mr. Fletcher.
It was so long ago.

11:08.049 --> 11:10.017
I want you to write a new song.

11:11.052 --> 11:12.314
- Okay.
- You see...

11:12.487 --> 11:14.455
...I recently broke up with my boyfriend.

11:14.622 --> 11:17.455
We had been together
for almost two months.

11:18.026 --> 11:19.687
It was a terrible experience.

11:19.861 --> 11:23.797
But then I read a book by Guru Mathashavi
called <i>A Way Back Into Love</i>.

11:24.532 --> 11:26.796
And that will be the title
of our new song.

11:26.968 --> 11:29.903
And in two weeks when I open my tour
at Madison Square Garden...

11:30.071 --> 11:31.595
...we'll perform it together.

11:31.773 --> 11:32.967
Okay. Here's the snag--

11:33.141 --> 11:35.109
We also wanna put the song
on her new CD...

11:35.276 --> 11:38.040
...which is pretty much finished,
so we need it by Friday.

11:38.212 --> 11:40.544
- This Friday?
- Yeah, but don't feel any pressure.

11:40.715 --> 11:44.207
We've got seven other retro artists
working on "Way Back Into Love"...

11:44.385 --> 11:46.546
...so if you blow it, we're covered.

11:46.721 --> 11:49.884
Mr. Fletcher,
don't look at this as a competition.

11:50.058 --> 11:52.856
If it's meant to be, it will be.

11:53.027 --> 11:54.494
It's destiny.

11:54.662 --> 11:55.686
Yes.

11:55.863 --> 11:57.387
Or not.

12:02.670 --> 12:03.796
Okay.

12:03.972 --> 12:07.237
I can't possibly write a song by Friday.
What could she be thinking of?

12:07.408 --> 12:09.569
All right. Look, look,
can I be honest with you?

12:09.744 --> 12:11.871
You're my manager.
I would have to fire you.

12:12.046 --> 12:13.638
We need this.

12:13.815 --> 12:17.012
Let's not be desperate.
We have the state fairs, Knott's Berry Farm.

12:17.185 --> 12:18.174
They've canceled.

12:20.855 --> 12:22.516
Knott's Berry canceled?

12:23.458 --> 12:26.393
Look. We're still on
for the Indiana State Fair, okay?

12:26.561 --> 12:29.394
But Texas and Arkansas dropped us.

12:29.564 --> 12:32.260
- The Apple Picking?
- The Apple Picking Festival is a go...

12:32.433 --> 12:36.096
...but Great Adventure only wants
three nights instead of 10. All right?

12:36.270 --> 12:39.296
My God. I had no idea.
Why didn't you tell me these things? Why--?

12:39.474 --> 12:41.339
I'm telling-- I'm telling you now.

12:41.509 --> 12:44.410
Alex, it's been 15 years since PoP.

12:44.579 --> 12:47.309
There's new old acts
coming up all the time.

12:47.482 --> 12:51.316
Tears for Fears is going on tour.
There's talk of a Spice Girl reunion.

12:51.486 --> 12:53.283
- That's not my audience.
- Ricky Martin.

12:53.454 --> 12:56.082
I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead.
I'm finished. I'm finished.

12:56.257 --> 12:59.021
- No, you're not dead.
- I'm gonna wind up doing bar mitzvahs.

12:59.193 --> 13:03.027
No, you're not. Thirteen-year-old kids
have no idea who you are.

13:03.197 --> 13:04.391
Well, that's good to know.

13:04.565 --> 13:07.591
What about you? You might actually
have to take on another client.

13:07.769 --> 13:11.830
Look, don't worry about me. What we gotta
concentrate on is refreshing your image.

13:12.006 --> 13:15.305
Then we'll get Knott's Berry
and Great Adventure. Who knows?

13:15.476 --> 13:18.809
- We might even get Disneyland.
- Don't tease me. I'm very vulnerable.

13:18.980 --> 13:21.312
Tell you something, Alex.
You do a song for Cora...

13:21.482 --> 13:24.576
...and there is a spot for you
in the Magic Kingdom, baby.

13:24.752 --> 13:28.051
Writing a song. I thought I was done
with that whole nightmare.

13:28.222 --> 13:30.747
Just one song.
That's all we need. One song.

13:31.225 --> 13:32.954
But it's so...

13:33.995 --> 13:35.485
...time-consuming, you know?

13:37.665 --> 13:39.633
And I haven't written for 10 years.

13:39.801 --> 13:43.237
And I need a lyricist. And it's never worked
with anyone except Colin.

13:43.404 --> 13:46.305
Look, I know it's not easy
to get somebody good this fast...

13:46.474 --> 13:49.534
...but there is this guy.
Supposedly he's very hip, very edgy.

13:49.711 --> 13:51.872
He just worked with Avril.

13:57.251 --> 13:59.845
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm just a bit blocked here.

14:00.021 --> 14:02.387
If you don't like the lyrics,
be straight with me.

14:02.890 --> 14:05.415
No, no, no, no.
The lyrics are very, very powerful.

14:05.827 --> 14:09.456
Maybe you want something
more commercial? More PoP-y?

14:10.264 --> 14:12.994
Just hold that thinly veiled insult
for one second.

14:18.673 --> 14:20.197
- Hello.
- Hey.

14:20.374 --> 14:23.775
- Khan said I could just come up?
- They were able to save the whole hand.

14:23.945 --> 14:27.005
I know. I made too big a deal out of it.

14:27.181 --> 14:30.446
It's just that I hate infections.
But then again, who likes them?

14:30.618 --> 14:33.985
- Maybe the people who make penicillin.
- There's two sides to every story.

14:34.155 --> 14:37.955
True. Except for the Nazis. I can't really see
the other side of that argument.

14:38.126 --> 14:39.423
Excuse me?

14:39.594 --> 14:42.529
I'm sorry. I didn't even see you there.
Hi. I'm Sophie Fisher.

14:42.697 --> 14:46.224
Yeah, Sophie, this is Greg Antonsky.
He's a noted lyricist.

14:46.801 --> 14:52.000
Really? Well, I don't wanna get in your way.
And I can see that I already have.

14:52.173 --> 14:55.836
So I'm off to the kitchen. Don't tell me.

14:56.010 --> 14:57.534
She's kind of hot.

14:57.712 --> 15:00.237
Good. Yeah. I'm glad you enjoyed her.

15:01.249 --> 15:02.910
She's coming back in here, right?

15:03.084 --> 15:06.417
I would imagine so. Unless she goes
directly back to the mother ship.

15:07.021 --> 15:08.852
How about:

15:09.290 --> 15:12.157
<i>Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch</i>

15:12.326 --> 15:14.988
<i>I look real good, but I'm a nasty bitch</i>

15:15.163 --> 15:18.223
<i>I can scream and claw</i>
<i>And curdle your blood</i>

15:18.399 --> 15:22.836
<i>But you'll die on your way back into love</i>

15:23.838 --> 15:26.830
No. Start on a minor third. Try that.

15:27.008 --> 15:29.476
Right. So:

15:29.644 --> 15:32.238
<i>Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch</i>

15:32.413 --> 15:34.108
<i>I look real good, but I'm a nasty--</i>

15:34.282 --> 15:35.977
Come on. You're missing the point.

15:36.150 --> 15:40.177
From the first line.
"Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch" is okay.

15:40.354 --> 15:41.651
But then it should be--

15:41.823 --> 15:45.884
<i>But with some magic, I just might switch</i>

15:51.365 --> 15:52.855
Sorry. What did you say?

15:55.102 --> 15:57.093
I don't remember.

15:57.538 --> 16:01.406
I think it was,
"But with some magic, I just might switch."

16:01.576 --> 16:04.272
- That is actually quite intriguing.
- That's not my lyric.

16:04.445 --> 16:06.174
No, I know, but it's a lovely phrase.

16:06.347 --> 16:09.111
Look, if you can't handle anything
except moon and June...

16:09.283 --> 16:13.117
...why don't we just let
plant girl finish the lyrics?

16:13.287 --> 16:14.549
Plant girl.

16:14.722 --> 16:17.316
<i>Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch</i>

16:17.491 --> 16:19.721
<i>But with some magic, I just might switch</i>

16:19.894 --> 16:23.694
- Finish it.
- I'm just here to cater to the plants.

16:23.865 --> 16:25.958
And you are doing a fine job,
if I may say so.

16:26.133 --> 16:27.725
Although that one is plastic.

16:30.338 --> 16:31.566
This is a waste of time.

16:32.974 --> 16:35.499
<i>Let's fly my broom to the stars above</i>

16:35.676 --> 16:39.510
<i>And we'll charm our way back into love</i>

16:43.751 --> 16:47.983
What's the next line,
"Feelings, nothing more than feelings"?

16:48.956 --> 16:50.617
You people disgust me.

16:53.961 --> 16:57.294
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gotten involved.
I have no filtering system.

16:57.465 --> 16:58.830
No. That's fine, that's fine.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.400
He had to get back to his job
at Hallmark anyway.

17:01.569 --> 17:04.002
Listen, have you ever done any writing?

17:04.171 --> 17:07.367
I mean, everybody's done some writing,
you know? Well, not everybody.

17:07.540 --> 17:09.771
Illiteracy is a growing epidemic
in this country.

17:09.944 --> 17:11.468
I write slogans for Weight-Not...

17:11.646 --> 17:14.342
...this weight reduction company
that my sister runs.

17:14.515 --> 17:16.847
Did you ever hear of the band PoP?

17:17.018 --> 17:21.011
Yeah, of course, everybody has.
My sister Rhonda loved them.

17:21.188 --> 17:24.214
They had that ridiculous hair
and those ridiculous outfits and--

17:24.392 --> 17:25.882
Oh, my God, you're one of them.

17:27.328 --> 17:29.159
That hair was very much in style then.

17:29.330 --> 17:31.298
- I'm very sorry.
- Yeah, that's fine.

17:31.465 --> 17:34.559
But I would love to talk to you
about maybe writing some lyrics.

17:34.969 --> 17:36.129
But I don't write lyrics.

17:36.304 --> 17:39.330
Well, we could just kick some ideas around,
repot the ficus.

17:39.507 --> 17:41.805
I don't think so.
I appreciate the offer, though.

17:41.976 --> 17:44.638
I have to go babysit for my sister now.
I mean, her kids.

17:44.812 --> 17:48.441
She's 38 now, so... Thank you.

17:50.952 --> 17:52.977
Okay, listen.
Do you know who Cora Corman is?

17:53.154 --> 17:54.781
Oh, yeah. My niece loves her.

17:54.956 --> 17:58.153
Okay, well, I'm writing a song for her,
so if you change your mind...

17:58.326 --> 18:02.262
...and the idea of working with me is
of any interest at all, please just call, okay?

18:02.430 --> 18:05.866
Or if you just fancy a good laugh,
I am performing at the Hilton tonight.

18:06.033 --> 18:09.400
Well, thank you.
I mean, but I can't, you know. I'm sorry.

18:09.570 --> 18:12.562
"I just can't," she says mysteriously.
But I just can't.

18:12.740 --> 18:15.174
- I'm sorry. Thank you for the offer.
- Yes.

18:19.914 --> 18:22.007
Oh, my God.

18:23.150 --> 18:24.777
Go to the next level, weirdo.

18:24.952 --> 18:27.318
You have to go to the next level.

18:27.888 --> 18:31.085
It's your parents. Go get into bed.
Get into bed. This is not a drill.

18:31.258 --> 18:35.024
- But we haven't even brushed our teeth.
- Get in there. Get in there. Get into bed.

18:35.796 --> 18:37.195
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:37.365 --> 18:39.196
- How was the movie?
- I enjoyed it.

18:39.367 --> 18:41.198
- He fell asleep.
- I enjoy sleeping.

18:41.369 --> 18:43.098
- How was dinner?
- Really nice place.

18:43.270 --> 18:46.330
It's really hard to enjoy dinner
when you run a weight-loss center.

18:46.507 --> 18:49.476
- If I get fat, there goes my fiscal year.
- Honey, you're not fat.

18:49.643 --> 18:52.669
You're not about to open a branch in Boca.
But thank you, sweetie.

18:52.847 --> 18:55.111
- How'd everything go here?
- Oh, yeah. Good. Great.

18:55.282 --> 18:57.716
The kids ate and went to sleep.

18:59.787 --> 19:02.950
Yeah, it-- They're really bad children.

19:03.391 --> 19:06.849
Okay, okay. Everybody goes to bed.
I'm sending your father in there.

19:07.028 --> 19:11.226
Whoa, we're so scared.

19:11.399 --> 19:13.765
And then I'm coming in.

19:15.336 --> 19:17.930
I'll just go check
to make sure they're still breathing.

19:18.773 --> 19:21.799
Hey, wanna do some stress eating?
Just a piece of diet cheesecake.

19:21.976 --> 19:25.241
This thing happened to me today--
I don't know. I'm just gonna go home.

19:25.413 --> 19:26.607
You seem so jumpy tonight.

19:26.781 --> 19:29.249
You know, I feel a little guilty
about something.

19:29.417 --> 19:30.577
How unusual for you.

19:31.052 --> 19:32.644
Okay, listen. I have to tell you.

19:32.820 --> 19:36.847
I met that guy from that band
you used to like. Alex Fletcher from PoP?

19:37.024 --> 19:38.082
Oh, my God.

19:38.259 --> 19:41.786
Anyway, I do Jane's plant service.
I'm taking over for her while she's gone.

19:41.962 --> 19:44.487
And anyway, she does his apartment,
so I was there.

19:44.665 --> 19:46.189
Actually, it was the second time.

19:46.367 --> 19:48.733
And he invited me
to come see him perform tonight.

19:48.903 --> 19:50.700
Gary, I'm going out!

19:50.871 --> 19:55.001
Oh, my God. I love him. I love him.
I love him. I love him.

19:56.010 --> 19:59.275
- That really wasn't the end of the story.
- Come on. Help me dress.

19:59.447 --> 20:01.779
Should I wear the red one?

20:24.305 --> 20:27.399
<i>I saw you across the dance floor</i>

20:27.575 --> 20:30.476
<i>Out of the corner of my eye</i>

20:31.011 --> 20:33.036
<i>I felt a connection</i>

20:33.214 --> 20:36.843
<i>I don't know how, I don't know why</i>

20:37.017 --> 20:40.009
<i>I shouldn't have stayed</i>
<i>When I saw you there</i>

20:40.187 --> 20:42.382
<i>With another man</i>

20:42.556 --> 20:45.855
<i>But as we slipped away</i>
<i>I thought I heard you say:</i>

20:46.026 --> 20:49.154
<i>"This wasn't part of the plan"</i>

20:51.065 --> 20:52.896
<i>Just a meaningless kiss</i>

20:53.434 --> 20:57.029
<i>It wasn't supposed to end up like this</i>

20:57.204 --> 20:58.899
<i>Just a meaningless kiss</i>

21:03.077 --> 21:05.443
<i>Just a meaningless kiss</i>

21:05.613 --> 21:08.878
<i>We knew it was wrong</i>
<i>But we couldn't resist</i>

21:09.049 --> 21:11.040
<i>Just a meaningless kiss</i>

21:11.218 --> 21:15.712
<i>'Til I fell in love with you</i>

21:15.890 --> 21:18.415
Girls, tell me the truth.
Are these pants too tight?

21:21.328 --> 21:23.023
Oh, my God, I gotta get up there.

21:23.197 --> 21:24.892
<i>And here we are two years later</i>

21:25.065 --> 21:27.465
<i>Too late to turn back now</i>

21:27.635 --> 21:30.570
<i>We've gotta finish</i>
<i>What we shouldn't have started</i>

21:30.738 --> 21:33.764
<i>We gotta walk away somehow</i>

21:33.941 --> 21:36.842
<i>But it's easier said than done</i>

21:37.011 --> 21:39.241
<i>When two hearts beat as one</i>

21:40.014 --> 21:42.539
<i>And three hearts are one too many</i>

21:42.716 --> 21:45.116
<i>That's why we shouldn't have ever begun</i>

21:48.222 --> 21:50.053
<i>Just a meaningless kiss</i>

21:50.224 --> 21:53.955
<i>We knew it was wrong</i>
<i>But we couldn't resist</i>

21:54.128 --> 21:55.789
<i>Just a meaningless kiss</i>

21:55.963 --> 22:00.627
<i>'Til I fell in love with you</i>

22:11.712 --> 22:14.579
<i>We can't go on like this forever</i>

22:14.748 --> 22:17.478
<i>When we're not meant to be together</i>

22:17.651 --> 22:20.620
<i>So leave me here on my own</i>

22:20.788 --> 22:24.622
<i>From now on I guess</i>
<i>I've gotta dance alone</i>

22:26.760 --> 22:29.888
<i>It wasn't supposed to end up like this</i>

22:43.444 --> 22:45.674
- Alex!
- Alex!

22:45.846 --> 22:47.370
- Hello, girls.
- Alex, I'm Barbara.

22:47.548 --> 22:49.846
In Boston, in 1989,
I came back to your hotel...

22:50.017 --> 22:53.453
If you wanna see Alex again,
check his website for the tour schedule.

22:53.621 --> 22:57.455
And the Knott's Berry Farm show
is temporarily postponed, okay?

22:57.625 --> 23:00.822
Great show, huh? They love you.
They're hot for you.

23:00.995 --> 23:04.328
Of course, they're also hot because
so many are going through menopause.

23:04.498 --> 23:08.764
Wait a minute.
Barbara from Boston. From Boston.

23:08.936 --> 23:11.871
I do remember that Barbara. I do.
I'm going back for one second.

23:12.039 --> 23:15.031
No. That's how we wind up
getting chased by angry husbands.

23:15.209 --> 23:17.268
- Not necessarily. She--
- Hi.

23:17.444 --> 23:18.809
Well, hi.

23:18.979 --> 23:22.415
Hello. Hello, hello. Very good news. Yes.

23:22.583 --> 23:23.914
Chris, you remember Sophie?

23:24.084 --> 23:26.075
Planted in my memory.

23:27.154 --> 23:30.749
I just wanted to apologize
for being so cryptic earlier.

23:30.924 --> 23:33.586
- This is my sister, Rhonda.
- Hi.

23:34.295 --> 23:39.198
I'm sorry. I've--
You were so great tonight.

23:39.366 --> 23:42.301
We've met, haven't we? Right?
We were practically a duet there.

23:42.469 --> 23:44.562
I know. Anyway,
could I get a quick autograph?

23:44.738 --> 23:46.103
You may, Rhonda.

23:46.273 --> 23:48.764
- Could I get a picture too?
- Only if you're single.

23:48.942 --> 23:51.672
I've been married 16 years,
but nothing's written in stone.

23:51.845 --> 23:53.176
Could you scootch? Thanks.

23:53.347 --> 23:55.747
Also, I really wanted to thank you
for your offer.

23:55.916 --> 23:58.384
- What offer?
- While Greg, the rhyming psychopath--

23:58.552 --> 23:59.610
Thanks again for him.

23:59.787 --> 24:03.052
--was in my apartment, Sophie spouted
some really interesting lyrics.

24:03.223 --> 24:04.713
I thought she was doing plants.

24:04.892 --> 24:06.189
I'm holding a pose here.

24:06.360 --> 24:08.521
- I appreciate it--
- I need a song by Friday...

24:08.696 --> 24:11.529
...and it is amazingly difficult
to find a sane lyricist.

24:11.699 --> 24:13.792
Why don't you just
write the lyrics yourself?

24:13.967 --> 24:16.902
- That's really not a strength of his.
- That's absolutely right.

24:17.071 --> 24:19.096
I once rhymed "you and me"
with "autopsy."

24:19.273 --> 24:20.934
Well, that's not necessarily bad.

24:21.108 --> 24:23.167
You could do something with that.
You know?

24:23.344 --> 24:28.111
<i>Figuring out you and me</i>
<i>Is like doing a love autopsy</i>

24:28.282 --> 24:31.445
- You see, you see. That's quite good.
- That's not bad.

24:31.618 --> 24:35.679
- Go on. More. How does it go?
- I have no idea.

24:35.856 --> 24:38.154
Someone could have sculpted us
in this time.

24:38.325 --> 24:39.690
You know what? Let me take it.

24:39.860 --> 24:43.057
<i>They could operate all day long</i>
<i>And never figure out what went wrong</i>

24:43.230 --> 24:46.097
My God, you are--
You are Cole Porter in panties.

24:46.266 --> 24:49.758
Of course, having said that,
Cole Porter probably did wear panties.

24:49.937 --> 24:52.428
Anyway, thank you for inviting us.

24:52.606 --> 24:56.838
Okay, I'm just gonna take a real quick one.
Let me take it. Let me take it, Sophie.

24:57.344 --> 24:59.778
- Thank you so much. That was great.
- Hang on.

24:59.947 --> 25:02.074
Nice to meet you guys. Bye-bye.

25:07.654 --> 25:09.713
So this is where Sophie works, eh?

25:09.890 --> 25:11.858
Yeah. She is gonna be right out.

25:12.025 --> 25:14.255
Excellent. Excellent.
Thank you very much.

25:16.697 --> 25:17.959
So how much do you weigh?

25:18.465 --> 25:19.864
I fluctuate. Yeah.

25:23.537 --> 25:26.097
Okay, look, I am terribly sorry
to barge in like this...

25:26.273 --> 25:29.003
...but I have decided
I cannot take no for an answer.

25:29.176 --> 25:31.007
- I told you that--
- You're not a writer.

25:31.178 --> 25:33.646
Except when you are writing poems
and short stories...

25:33.814 --> 25:35.611
...in the New School literary magazine.

25:35.783 --> 25:37.444
I Googled you. And you were good.

25:37.618 --> 25:39.210
Look, I'm flattered.

25:39.386 --> 25:43.345
I mean, you're one of six people
in the world who's actually read those...

25:43.524 --> 25:45.890
...but that doesn't mean
I can write a song.

25:46.360 --> 25:50.421
You already did.
Five minutes, that's all I ask.

25:51.265 --> 25:54.792
Please, step in. You'll enjoy this.
This is a treat.

25:55.636 --> 25:57.103
Mr. Fletcher. Nice to see you.

25:57.271 --> 25:59.671
- Very nice to see you, Mia, how are you?
- Wonderful.

25:59.840 --> 26:02.308
I just want to get--
Can I try the new Mason & Hamlin?

26:02.476 --> 26:06.139
- Sure, absolutely. Be my guest.
- Thank you very much. Thanks. Please.

26:06.313 --> 26:10.579
This is-- It's just a little something
that you might possibly recognize.

26:12.085 --> 26:15.282
<i>Figuring out you and me</i>

26:15.456 --> 26:20.086
<i>Is like doing a love autopsy</i>

26:20.260 --> 26:23.229
<i>They could operate all day long</i>

26:23.397 --> 26:26.958
<i>And never figure out what went wrong</i>

26:28.202 --> 26:30.432
<i>Love autopsy</i>

26:32.072 --> 26:34.199
<i>Love autopsy</i>

26:42.516 --> 26:45.280
<i>What went wrong?</i>

26:51.158 --> 26:54.184
God. That melody is so beautiful.

26:54.361 --> 26:56.352
But I've never written a song.

26:56.530 --> 26:58.930
A song. I know, I know.
And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

26:59.099 --> 27:03.126
I just don't think I am.
I think you may be a born lyricist.

27:05.739 --> 27:08.936
We don't have very long,
but what I'd like to do, in an ideal world...

27:09.109 --> 27:10.701
...is continue the "Autopsy" song.

27:10.878 --> 27:13.676
But I think it's gonna be very hard
to get back from there...

27:13.847 --> 27:16.907
...into "Way Back Into Love,"
which is the title that Cora demands.

27:17.084 --> 27:20.850
What we could do is continue
with Greg "the Angel of Death's" version.

27:21.021 --> 27:22.386
That's plagiarism.

27:22.556 --> 27:24.649
Yes. Yes, yes. Good. Excellent.

27:24.825 --> 27:27.419
I would never in a million years
use someone else's work.

27:27.594 --> 27:28.788
I'm very glad you agree.

27:28.962 --> 27:34.559
So, what we need,
we need something brand-new.

27:35.669 --> 27:39.070
- So let's see. A song for Cora.
- Yes.

27:39.239 --> 27:43.039
- Has to be called "A Way Back Into Love."
- Correct.

27:43.210 --> 27:45.508
And it has to be something
Cora would sing about.

27:45.679 --> 27:46.941
Good.

27:47.114 --> 27:49.275
And it has to be something
you would sing about.

27:49.449 --> 27:50.609
Good, yeah.

27:50.784 --> 27:53.947
- What would you sing about?
- Whatever gets me the job, really.

27:54.521 --> 27:56.887
Oh, that's inspiring.

28:02.262 --> 28:06.699
Okay. Two people
searching for love, for salvation.

28:06.867 --> 28:08.164
Good, good, I love that.

28:08.335 --> 28:11.702
Love lost, love found.

28:12.339 --> 28:13.670
Love lost again.

28:13.840 --> 28:17.469
Yes, this is starting to sound
a little bit like luggage, but good.

28:36.163 --> 28:37.721
Thanks. That's really helpful.

28:38.332 --> 28:40.664
It doesn't have to be perfect.
Just spit it out.

28:40.834 --> 28:43.234
- They're just lyrics.
- "Just lyrics"?

28:44.237 --> 28:47.866
Lyrics are important.
They're just not as important as melody.

28:49.209 --> 28:50.870
I really don't think you get it.

28:51.345 --> 28:53.210
Oh, you look angry. Click your pen.

28:53.380 --> 28:56.315
A melody is like seeing someone
for the first time.

28:56.483 --> 28:58.348
The physical attraction. Sex.

28:58.952 --> 29:00.817
I so get that.

29:00.988 --> 29:04.116
But then, as you get to know the person,
that's the lyrics.

29:04.291 --> 29:06.919
Their story. Who they are underneath.

29:07.594 --> 29:11.860
It's the combination of the two
that makes it magic.

29:12.032 --> 29:13.624
Let's go for a walk.

29:13.800 --> 29:16.769
- A walk? What, now?
- Yeah.

29:16.937 --> 29:21.271
Out on the streets you see things
and, you know, hear things and eat things.

29:21.441 --> 29:23.932
It all sort of unlocks your mind.

29:28.649 --> 29:30.310
This is good. This is good.

29:30.484 --> 29:32.748
When you hit a wall,
you gotta change the subject.

29:32.919 --> 29:34.216
So why did PoP break up?

29:34.388 --> 29:37.186
I mean, Rhonda told me
that you guys were friends growing up?

29:37.357 --> 29:39.689
We were, yes,
and then Colin met a new manager...

29:39.860 --> 29:42.090
...who convinced him
he was the star of the band.

29:42.262 --> 29:45.754
Shortly after, he left, taking the last
three songs we'd written together...

29:45.932 --> 29:49.698
...and putting them on his solo album
which went on to sell eight million records.

29:49.870 --> 29:52.532
But how did you deal with that?

29:52.706 --> 29:54.640
Oh, with drugs, alcohol...

29:54.808 --> 29:58.835
...and ultimately, my own solo album.

30:03.550 --> 30:04.778
Cool.

30:04.951 --> 30:07.511
This copy has been in the racks
for six years.

30:07.688 --> 30:09.417
- Come on.
- No, no. I check every week.

30:09.589 --> 30:12.057
You see, I made a little mark,
there on the back. See?

30:12.225 --> 30:15.058
It sold only 50,000 copies,
most of those to my mother.

30:15.228 --> 30:17.788
<i>Rolling Stone</i> called it
"a crass, contrived effort...

30:17.964 --> 30:20.489
...not even good enough
for a dentist chair."

30:21.968 --> 30:24.163
Well, I'm sure there were other reviews.

30:24.337 --> 30:26.737
There were, there were.
But none as good as that one.

30:26.907 --> 30:28.841
And they were right, by the way. Yeah.

30:31.311 --> 30:33.836
To cut a long story short,
I gave up trying to write...

30:34.014 --> 30:36.778
...lost an incredible amount of money
and then my apartment.

30:36.950 --> 30:39.976
Chris stuck by me, booked me
an '80s reunion night on Long Island.

30:40.153 --> 30:42.246
And suddenly, they liked me again.

30:42.422 --> 30:44.652
It was weird.
It was like I'd never been away.

30:44.825 --> 30:46.725
The audience was a tad older, as was I...

30:46.893 --> 30:50.158
...but we were very, very profoundly happy
to see each other again.

30:50.330 --> 30:53.163
And it went on from there.

30:53.333 --> 30:56.860
Cruises. Reunions. Knott's Berry Farm,
which I'm sure you're familiar with.

30:57.037 --> 31:00.734
Busch Gardens,
that's one of my big fixtures of the year.

31:00.907 --> 31:02.238
What else can I tell you?

31:02.409 --> 31:05.936
I really appreciate
you opening up to me like this.

31:07.380 --> 31:10.508
I know what it's like
to live with a shadow overhead.

31:14.221 --> 31:15.449
What?

31:17.824 --> 31:19.018
Shadow.

31:19.659 --> 31:24.323
<i>I've been living with a shadow overhead</i>

31:25.265 --> 31:27.495
Now, that's a nice melody, isn't it?

31:27.667 --> 31:29.464
- It's good.
- Thank you. Thank you.

31:29.636 --> 31:32.161
Mind you, what do you know?
You don't even like melody.

31:32.339 --> 31:34.000
I never said that.

31:34.174 --> 31:36.074
You prefer the lyrics.

31:36.243 --> 31:37.301
I don't trust you.

31:37.477 --> 31:38.842
Your turn, what's next?

31:39.813 --> 31:42.145
I think that we should get
some breakfast.

31:42.315 --> 31:45.113
Please, come on, we're finally
on a roll here. Listen again.

31:45.285 --> 31:49.051
<i>I've been living with a shadow overhead</i>

31:49.222 --> 31:52.385
<i>There'll be no more rhymes until I'm fed</i>

31:52.559 --> 31:54.083
Please, seriously, seriously.

31:54.261 --> 31:56.354
<i>I've been living with a shadow overhead</i>

31:56.530 --> 31:59.363
<i>I could be inspired</i>
<i>With just a piece of bread</i>

32:00.100 --> 32:02.159
- I have the perfect place.
- Wait a minute.

32:02.335 --> 32:03.666
It's just on the next corner.

32:03.837 --> 32:05.737
- Keep moving and keep writing.
- All right.

32:05.906 --> 32:09.467
<i>I've been looking</i>
<i>For someone to shed some light</i>

32:10.010 --> 32:11.807
- That's good. That's good.
- Yeah?

32:11.978 --> 32:13.843
Shadows and light. You're deep.

32:14.014 --> 32:16.847
Okay, we need two more lines
of Cora verse. What's next?

32:17.017 --> 32:18.348
Soph?

32:21.254 --> 32:22.243
Sophie?

32:23.757 --> 32:25.349
What are you doing?

32:25.525 --> 32:26.924
Nothing.

32:27.093 --> 32:31.086
I thought I saw someone,
but it wasn't him. So it's fine.

32:31.264 --> 32:34.665
- Oh, there he is.
- What?

32:34.835 --> 32:37.804
A very nice picture, though.
That's funny.

32:38.572 --> 32:41.905
Interestingly enough, I mean--
Well, it is a bookstore.

32:42.075 --> 32:44.236
- So, you know, that does happen.
- What?

32:45.812 --> 32:47.803
Gosh, where were we? Okay.

32:47.981 --> 32:49.278
<i>Shadow overhead</i>

32:49.449 --> 32:53.283
Okay, can I just say, with all due respect,
that you are clearly--

32:53.453 --> 32:55.421
What is the word?
--insane at this moment.

32:55.589 --> 32:58.422
And because, according to Chris,
we have less than 36 hours...

32:58.592 --> 33:01.720
...before Cora goes to do <i>Leno</i>,
at which point my career is over...

33:01.895 --> 33:07.299
...it would be infinitely better for me
if you were sane. So how can I help?

33:10.170 --> 33:11.330
Do you know this book?

33:14.241 --> 33:17.472
<i>Sally Michaels?</i> Yes, yes.
Big bestseller. Yes.

33:17.644 --> 33:19.737
- Have you read it?
- No, of course not.

33:19.913 --> 33:23.974
Last book I read was <i>The Alex Fletcher Story</i>
by the editors of <i>Teen Dream Magazine</i>.

33:26.019 --> 33:27.486
Why?

33:32.025 --> 33:35.119
I'm Sally Michaels.

33:37.697 --> 33:41.224
<i>I saw that they were giving these courses</i>
<i>on writing at the New School...</i>

33:41.401 --> 33:43.392
<i>...so I signed up.</i>

33:43.570 --> 33:46.971
<i>And my teacher was Sloan Cates.</i>

33:47.140 --> 33:49.131
<i>Brilliant, handsome.</i>

33:49.309 --> 33:52.540
The truth is, I was in love with him.

33:53.313 --> 33:55.338
And we began spending
every minute together.

33:55.515 --> 33:59.315
Which is why I was sort of surprised
when his fiancÃ©e showed up.

34:00.587 --> 34:04.114
Yeah, he never mentioned that
he was engaged to a history professor...

34:04.291 --> 34:06.725
...who was on a year-long sabbatical
in Spain.

34:06.893 --> 34:09.384
And when she popped in
for an unexpected visit...

34:09.562 --> 34:13.157
...it sort of turned into a reenactment
of the Inquisition.

34:13.600 --> 34:16.125
And that-- And that was that?
That was the end of that?

34:16.303 --> 34:18.396
Yeah. We never saw each other again.

34:18.571 --> 34:21.802
I dropped the class and a year later,
his new novel showed up.

34:22.208 --> 34:24.039
The Sally What's-it novel.

34:24.210 --> 34:26.940
"The tale of a student
with exalted literary aspirations...

34:27.112 --> 34:31.413
...who lures a brilliant writer into an affair
so she can take advantage of his connections.

34:31.918 --> 34:36.252
But when he tries to break it off,
she devotes herself to ruining his life."

34:36.589 --> 34:38.920
Well, I mean, that obviously wasn't you.

34:40.025 --> 34:45.862
Well, she's a lit major from Long Island,
5'4", my color hair, all my habits.

34:46.032 --> 34:49.058
You know, talks to herself
and asks too many questions.

34:49.235 --> 34:51.668
Her parents founded
a weight reduction company...

34:51.838 --> 34:53.601
...that now her sister runs.

34:54.007 --> 34:55.940
Well, anyway, I...

34:56.676 --> 34:59.372
Since then, every time I pick up a pen...

34:59.546 --> 35:02.947
...I'm haunted by those words
that he wrote, you know?

35:03.116 --> 35:06.142
"She was a brilliant mimic." You know.

35:06.319 --> 35:09.117
"She could ape Dorothy Parker
or Emily Dickinson...

35:09.289 --> 35:12.452
...but stripped of someone else's
literary clothes...

35:12.625 --> 35:17.028
...she was a vacant,
empty imitation of a writer."

35:17.931 --> 35:20.923
First of all, you can't listen to some jerk.

35:21.434 --> 35:24.801
He's not a jerk.
He's a National Book Award winner.

35:24.971 --> 35:28.372
Well, then, get the best revenge,
write a hit song.

35:29.275 --> 35:32.472
Honestly, I don't think a pop song
is gonna impress Sloan Cates.

35:32.879 --> 35:35.677
Oh, no, of course not.
Pop is just for morons. Forgot that.

35:35.849 --> 35:39.114
- I didn't mean anything by it.
- Brain-dead, or taken too many drugs.

35:39.285 --> 35:41.310
You know what I'd say
to you and Sloan Cates?

35:41.488 --> 35:43.649
You can take all the novels
in the world...

35:43.823 --> 35:47.054
...and not one of them
will make you feel as good as fast as:

35:53.933 --> 35:55.901
That is real poetry. Those are real poets.

35:56.069 --> 36:00.096
Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder,
Bob Dylan, the Beatles.

36:00.273 --> 36:04.232
Okay. What if one of your heroes
came up to you and said--

36:04.411 --> 36:06.971
You know, Smokey, what if he said:

36:07.147 --> 36:10.947
"Alex Fletcher,
you are a horrible songwriter"?

36:11.117 --> 36:12.106
How would you react?

36:12.285 --> 36:15.948
I know Smokey a little bit. He's too nice
a gentleman ever to say such a thing.

36:17.023 --> 36:20.288
Dylan might. Dylan would, actually.
In fact, Dylan did.

36:20.460 --> 36:25.329
Okay, Dylan walks up to you and he says,
"You are a horrible songwriter."

36:26.699 --> 36:28.997
- How do you react?
- I would be horribly depressed.

36:29.169 --> 36:31.797
Yes. I would. I would.

36:31.971 --> 36:35.634
But then, after, you know,
months of brooding...

36:35.809 --> 36:38.642
...I would find a lyricist...

36:39.312 --> 36:42.907
...and write a song
about how horribly depressed I was.

36:43.083 --> 36:46.712
And it would be a big hit, everyone
would love me, and I'd make lots of money.

36:46.886 --> 36:49.582
Suddenly I'd be less depressed
than if I just sat around...

36:49.756 --> 36:53.123
...being a little bit self-indulgent,
letting my misery eat away at me...

36:53.293 --> 36:58.196
...until I'd become an emotional wreck
and creatively completely moribund.

37:00.533 --> 37:02.296
Yes, moribund.

37:06.673 --> 37:08.334
- Okay, let's go. Come on.
- All right.

37:08.975 --> 37:12.741
<i>I've been living with a shadow overhead</i>

37:12.912 --> 37:16.848
<i>I've been sleeping</i>
<i>With a clown above my bed</i>

37:17.016 --> 37:19.576
- "Clown" is not right. What is that word?
- It's "cloud."

37:19.752 --> 37:23.279
- Write more clearly. How can I--?
- Why would you have a clown in your bed?

37:23.456 --> 37:26.118
- It would not be the first time.
- Yeah, I'm not surprised.

37:26.292 --> 37:28.692
- Write in capital letters.
- Why don't you write it?

37:28.862 --> 37:31.296
I'm sorry, Khan.
We're gonna come back in one second.

37:31.464 --> 37:34.194
You dictate, I'll write.
And I will write like a human...

37:34.367 --> 37:36.426
...and not like a small Pekingese dog.

37:36.603 --> 37:39.731
What are you doing, you madwoman?
You're destroying my apartment.

37:39.906 --> 37:42.170
I can't write from across the room.

37:42.342 --> 37:45.140
Well, you're not writing here.
Get back to your corner.

37:45.311 --> 37:46.300
I can't have you here.

37:46.479 --> 37:49.937
- I'll be blocked. I'll be completely stuck.
- So go out the other side.

37:50.116 --> 37:52.175
I've never been the other side.

37:53.052 --> 37:56.351
Push, push. Push, push.

38:01.661 --> 38:03.788
Good. Better.

38:03.963 --> 38:07.091
You're still a fraction close.
Just-- Just back off, just one...

38:07.267 --> 38:08.757
Just-- Just--

38:08.935 --> 38:10.402
There, fine, good.

38:10.570 --> 38:12.060
Okay.

38:28.254 --> 38:31.087
And I don't think those chords are right.

38:31.257 --> 38:34.124
It has to sound different than the verse.

38:34.527 --> 38:36.518
What kind of different
did you have in mind?

38:36.696 --> 38:39.460
I don't know.
Something sadder, you know?

38:39.632 --> 38:42.863
And I still don't like my line
about "places in my mind."

38:43.036 --> 38:46.233
- It's fine.
- Fine isn't good.

38:46.406 --> 38:47.930
We only have time for fine.

38:48.107 --> 38:50.541
I tell you what.
We'll change "places in my mind"...

38:50.710 --> 38:53.110
...if I can keep the chord sequence
into the bridge.

38:53.279 --> 38:54.712
This isn't a negotiation.

38:54.881 --> 38:58.009
It's either right or wrong,
inspired or insipid.

38:58.184 --> 39:02.120
It's 4 in the morning. We're not writing the
last movement of the "Jupiter Symphony."

39:02.288 --> 39:05.314
It's a song for someone who's last hit
was "Welcome to Bootytown."

39:05.491 --> 39:06.788
Please, get back to work.

39:06.960 --> 39:09.656
I still don't like it.

39:09.829 --> 39:12.491
And it's "Entering Bootytown."

39:13.866 --> 39:16.334
And another thing,
the whole top section...

39:16.736 --> 39:19.034
I mean, it's so close.
We're just not there yet.

39:19.205 --> 39:21.605
We just-- We have to focus
and stay, you know...

39:21.774 --> 39:24.368
...completely understanding
of what we're trying to say.

39:24.544 --> 39:27.604
Okay, you may now
start killing the next one.

39:30.283 --> 39:35.516
<i>All I wanna do</i>
<i>Is find a way back into love</i>

39:39.092 --> 39:44.962
<i>I can't make it through</i>
<i>Without a way back into love</i>

39:51.204 --> 39:52.865
You know, I'm tone-deaf.

40:14.694 --> 40:16.958
Hey, what do you think of this?

40:17.130 --> 40:20.497
Just keep writing.
Cora is leaving in an hour.

40:46.492 --> 40:50.690
Listen, I was thinking that "corners"
was such a better word than "spaces."

40:50.863 --> 40:54.060
For "in the mind." "The corners
of my mind," rather than "the spaces."

40:54.233 --> 40:57.532
It just seems to have a better boundary
to it, you know?

40:57.704 --> 41:00.901
Should I speak to you
about this later? Okay.

41:10.216 --> 41:13.447
It sounds so good. I can't believe it.

41:13.619 --> 41:15.382
And now...

41:15.555 --> 41:17.022
...vocals.

41:17.190 --> 41:20.819
No, you see, you have to sing
into the microphone. It won't follow you.

41:20.993 --> 41:23.257
- But I can't.
- It's a duet for a man and a woman.

41:23.429 --> 41:24.953
We are as close as we've got.

41:25.131 --> 41:28.794
Your headphones and a level. You look nice.
You should wear them all the time.

41:28.968 --> 41:31.266
How is that?

41:31.437 --> 41:32.495
- Yes?
- Okay!

41:34.440 --> 41:35.600
It's okay.

41:35.775 --> 41:37.970
And...

41:39.679 --> 41:42.614
..."Way Back Into Love." Take one.

41:42.782 --> 41:45.046
Oh, God. I'm getting really nervous.

41:45.218 --> 41:47.482
You'll be fine.
Just use your normal nice voice...

41:47.653 --> 41:50.053
...that I've heard so much of
in the last three days.

41:50.223 --> 41:53.351
It's like my throat's closing up.
It's like anaphylactic.

41:53.526 --> 41:55.790
It's fine. It's just a three-minute song.

42:00.199 --> 42:05.000
<i>I've been living with a shadow overhead</i>

42:05.171 --> 42:06.661
<i>I've been sleeping with a...</i>

42:06.839 --> 42:09.637
Just a little bit louder.
This song is intended for humans.

42:09.809 --> 42:12.539
"Way Back Into Love." Take two.

42:15.581 --> 42:20.211
<i>I've been living with a shadow overhead</i>

42:20.386 --> 42:25.016
<i>I've been sleeping</i>
<i>With a cloud above my bed</i>

42:25.191 --> 42:28.388
<i>I've been lonely for so long</i>

42:29.429 --> 42:34.298
<i>Trapped in the past</i>
<i>I just can't seem to move on</i>

42:34.834 --> 42:39.430
<i>I've been hiding all my hopes</i>
<i>And dreams away</i>

42:39.605 --> 42:44.508
<i>Just in case I ever need 'em</i>
<i>Again someday</i>

42:44.677 --> 42:47.578
<i>I've been setting aside time</i>

42:48.347 --> 42:53.580
<i>To clear a little space</i>
<i>In the corners of my mind</i>

42:54.654 --> 43:01.253
<i>All I wanna do</i>
<i>Is find a way back into love</i>

43:04.197 --> 43:11.069
<i>I can't make it through</i>
<i>Without a way back into love</i>

43:11.571 --> 43:14.335
Hey, hey! Taxi! She's gonna have a baby!

43:14.507 --> 43:16.634
Hey, what if that were true?

43:16.809 --> 43:17.798
Another one.

43:45.938 --> 43:48.463
- Oh, my God. It's Cora.
- Okay, stay calm.

43:48.641 --> 43:51.109
- C, you remember Alex Fletcher.
- How are you, C?

43:51.277 --> 43:53.074
- Hi, Alex.
- Sophie Fisher, my lyricist.

43:53.246 --> 43:55.214
Hi. Aspiring lyricist, actually.

43:55.381 --> 43:57.076
So Ray tells me you have a song.

43:58.084 --> 44:01.053
We do. A little ditty. It's just a rough...

44:01.220 --> 44:04.212
Yeah, go ahead, take it. Help yourself.

44:04.390 --> 44:05.948
Oh, we're gonna do it now?

44:06.125 --> 44:09.652
Great, great. No time like the present.

44:09.829 --> 44:14.163
Very rough. Just put together
in my little studio. Both of us singing.

44:14.333 --> 44:16.426
She's gonna hear my voice,
it's gonna ruin it.

44:16.602 --> 44:17.591
It's gonna be fine.

44:23.009 --> 44:25.569
Anyone see <i>Battle of the '80s Has-Beens</i>
the other night?

44:25.745 --> 44:27.736
That Debbie Gibson,
she can take a punch.

44:33.586 --> 44:35.486
I didn't see it.

45:24.036 --> 45:27.096
This is the song I've been looking for.
I can't wait to work on it.

45:27.273 --> 45:29.070
Congratulations, guys. We gotta book.

45:29.241 --> 45:32.074
Thank you so much.
Looking forward to working with you guys.

45:32.244 --> 45:33.370
Congratulations.

45:33.546 --> 45:34.945
- D Money!
- Let's go home.

45:35.114 --> 45:36.376
This way, folks.

45:37.550 --> 45:39.211
It's unbelievable. We got the job.

45:40.019 --> 45:42.249
I thank you. Thank you.

45:43.189 --> 45:46.283
I thank you, I thank you...

45:49.395 --> 45:52.262
Yes? Chris, she loved it.

45:52.431 --> 45:54.194
Unbelievable!

45:54.367 --> 45:56.358
Definitely. Where are you?

45:56.535 --> 45:58.298
Okay, got it. Got it.

45:58.471 --> 46:00.701
We're going to dinner. Come on.

46:02.208 --> 46:07.111
To Sophie Fisher, the woman who paved
my way back to Knott's Berry Farm.

46:07.279 --> 46:09.008
Gloria, I love your dress.

46:09.181 --> 46:12.173
Oh, thank you.
It's nice to clean up after a day of work.

46:12.351 --> 46:13.477
Where do you work?

46:13.653 --> 46:16.019
I'm a therapist at Columbia-Presbyterian.

46:16.188 --> 46:18.588
I'm working on a study
examining the relationship--

46:18.758 --> 46:19.782
Oh, my God.

46:19.959 --> 46:22.450
That's a strike against us, right?
I mean...

46:22.628 --> 46:25.756
What is it? What?

46:25.931 --> 46:28.195
- Sloan.
- Sloan?

46:31.270 --> 46:33.738
Mr. Cates, good evening.
How are you? Nice to see you.

46:33.906 --> 46:35.737
I'd say about two minutes.

46:38.144 --> 46:40.806
- Hi, how you doing?
- Here it comes.

46:42.448 --> 46:44.109
Here's the thing...

46:58.931 --> 47:00.330
Is she all right?

47:02.068 --> 47:05.299
Yeah, she always does this.
It's her way of working up an appetite.

47:05.471 --> 47:06.460
Hang on.

47:13.045 --> 47:15.013
Hello? Sophie?

47:15.181 --> 47:16.648
He's at the bar.

47:16.816 --> 47:19.580
I know. I know. I know.
I saw him. I saw him.

47:19.752 --> 47:22.880
He's not that great, you know.
I saw the beginnings of a bald patch.

47:23.055 --> 47:26.388
- Why, come and have a look.
- Oh, he has a great head of hair.

47:26.559 --> 47:27.856
Oh, God.

47:28.027 --> 47:30.188
I think I'll just stay in here
until he leaves.

47:30.362 --> 47:32.887
Maybe you could send in a salad
and an iced tea?

47:33.065 --> 47:36.296
Right. I'll get the waiter.
Would you like the dessert cart as well?

47:36.469 --> 47:38.369
Look, this is ridiculous.

47:39.371 --> 47:41.566
I've been dreaming
about confronting him too.

47:41.741 --> 47:44.710
I had a speech prepared for over a year.

47:45.745 --> 47:47.804
Would you like to hear it?

47:48.614 --> 47:50.479
Very, very much.

47:51.751 --> 47:53.981
Hello there. Good evening.

47:57.022 --> 48:01.652
Sloan, even though Sally Michaels
only lives on paper...

48:01.827 --> 48:03.260
...I live in the world.

48:03.429 --> 48:06.626
And I can never forgive you
for using me as raw material...

48:06.799 --> 48:08.824
...to create a fictional monster.

48:09.001 --> 48:11.367
Sally Michaels
is my own personal ghost...

48:11.537 --> 48:14.995
...a shadow hanging over each phone call
and cup of iced tea.

48:15.174 --> 48:19.338
And one cold day, when age
has robbed your mind of its fertile phrases...

48:19.512 --> 48:23.278
...and your hand of its dexterity, all
the success won't be able to shield you...

48:23.449 --> 48:26.043
...from the pain you've caused
and the shame you deserve.

48:26.218 --> 48:28.118
Or something like that.

48:28.721 --> 48:31.121
But now I know
I could never actually say it to him.

48:31.290 --> 48:34.555
No. You have to say that. You have
to say that. You have to say it now.

48:34.727 --> 48:37.127
Now is the perfect time.
You're on top of the world.

48:37.296 --> 48:39.696
You wrote a song
for the biggest act in the universe.

48:39.865 --> 48:41.162
- But I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

48:41.333 --> 48:43.995
People wait to see an ex-lover
when things are going well.

48:44.170 --> 48:46.934
It never happens.
You can make relationship history here.

48:47.106 --> 48:50.439
But I can't. I mean, look at me.
I haven't showered in days.

48:50.609 --> 48:53.874
I'm covered in songwriting grime.
The helicopter flew bugs in my teeth.

48:54.046 --> 48:57.140
Yes, yes, yes. You are a little mangy.

48:58.984 --> 49:01.714
Wait. Wait. Stay.

49:06.959 --> 49:09.928
Sorry, Gloria.
Can I ask you a great favor?

49:10.095 --> 49:13.587
Could you accompany me
to the ladies' room?

49:15.534 --> 49:18.059
He's a good guy. Go ahead.

49:18.237 --> 49:21.365
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Sure. Be right back.

49:29.849 --> 49:32.682
- That's fantastic.
- You look great.

49:32.852 --> 49:36.049
Eleven years of therapy and I finally
help someone. Good luck, honey.

49:36.222 --> 49:37.211
Thank you so much.

49:37.389 --> 49:39.880
Yes, thank you. Thank you, doctor.

49:40.559 --> 49:41.548
It doesn't really fit.

49:41.727 --> 49:44.127
- No, on the contrary. It fits you perfectly.
- Really?

49:44.296 --> 49:46.856
I'm not saying you should go
to confession like that...

49:47.032 --> 49:49.432
...but for what you're about to do,
it's perfect.

49:50.903 --> 49:52.461
Okay. Are you ready?

49:53.172 --> 49:56.005
I think I'm developing
a sudden coronary blockage.

49:56.175 --> 49:57.574
Those pass very quickly, okay?

49:57.743 --> 49:59.472
Shortness of breath. Blurred vision.

49:59.645 --> 50:01.112
- You're fine.
- Scurvy?

50:02.348 --> 50:03.906
You're beautiful. No, it's fine.

50:04.083 --> 50:06.779
"I don't write bestsellers
because I despise humanity."

50:06.952 --> 50:11.651
And I said, "No, John, you don't write
bestsellers because the feeling is mutual."

50:12.858 --> 50:16.191
Should I have stopped? Should
I have stopped right there? Was it over?

50:16.362 --> 50:20.765
Hi. Sophie. My God, Sophie.

50:21.901 --> 50:24.096
How are you?

50:26.572 --> 50:28.233
I'm fine, yeah.

50:28.407 --> 50:30.932
Good, it's great to see you.

50:31.110 --> 50:35.444
- Alex Fletcher. Hi, how are you?
- Hey, Alex. Sloan Cates. How are you?

50:35.614 --> 50:39.812
Well, it's been an eternity.
You look incredible.

50:40.486 --> 50:44.081
Then you were always
mysteriously seductive, weren't you?

50:44.857 --> 50:47.690
She is writing a song for Cora Corman.

50:48.661 --> 50:52.563
What? No. Wait. You're a songwriter?

50:52.731 --> 50:55.291
I-- I wrote...

50:55.467 --> 50:57.492
Brilliant lyrics. Fantastic lyrics.

50:57.670 --> 51:00.332
A lot of people
are talking about them, actually.

51:00.506 --> 51:03.066
I had a pen, a paper and wrote...

51:05.644 --> 51:10.047
Sloan, the thing is, even though
Sally Michaels only lives on paper...

51:10.215 --> 51:11.842
...Sophie lives in the real world.

51:12.017 --> 51:13.245
She can never forgive you--

51:13.419 --> 51:15.944
- Mr. Cates, your table's ready.
- Great, thanks, Stefan.

51:16.121 --> 51:19.352
Listen, I'll be right there, guys. I'm sorry.

51:19.525 --> 51:22.255
They're throwing
this little dinner thing for me.

51:22.428 --> 51:25.397
It's crazy how lavish people get
no matter how cheap they are...

51:25.564 --> 51:27.589
- ...when Hollywood comes calling.
- Hollywood.

51:27.766 --> 51:30.462
I've sold out. They're making a film
out of <i>Sally Michaels</i>.

51:30.636 --> 51:31.625
- Really?
- Yeah.

51:31.804 --> 51:33.999
It's been crazy. I wrote the script.

51:34.173 --> 51:36.573
We're seeing actresses.
It's been-- You know.

51:37.476 --> 51:40.843
But listen, it's great seeing you.
Let's get together, okay?

51:43.315 --> 51:45.112
Take care of yourself.

51:47.453 --> 51:49.284
Take care, Allen.

51:54.093 --> 51:55.560
Well...

51:56.195 --> 51:58.789
...must feel good to get that over with.

52:02.901 --> 52:04.232
I just wanna go home.

52:04.403 --> 52:06.963
Okay. Okay. Okay.

52:07.139 --> 52:10.302
Hang on. Just hang on one second.
One second.

52:11.110 --> 52:13.305
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry to bother you.

52:13.479 --> 52:16.812
It would mean the world if you'd
just let her say what she came to say.

52:16.982 --> 52:18.779
I know what she came here to say, okay?

52:18.951 --> 52:21.784
Some sad little story
about how I ruined her life...

52:21.954 --> 52:23.421
...while the truth is...

52:26.291 --> 52:29.226
...that she seduced me
so that I'd help get her published, okay?

52:29.395 --> 52:32.387
Come on. You were engaged
and you never even told her.

52:32.898 --> 52:35.162
I'd say we're done talking.

52:35.334 --> 52:36.767
Bye-bye.

52:39.972 --> 52:42.338
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

52:42.508 --> 52:44.408
<i>Wait.</i>

52:46.211 --> 52:49.237
Do me a favor.
Why don't you just shove off?

52:49.415 --> 52:52.907
I appreciate your request,
but why don't you just shove off?

52:53.085 --> 52:56.282
- Take it easy, my friend.
- I don't believe I will take it easy.

52:57.322 --> 52:59.085
All right. All right!

53:00.325 --> 53:04.022
Don't hurt his hair.
He's working Adventureland this weekend.

53:04.196 --> 53:06.756
I'm giving up. My face is in the butter.

53:10.669 --> 53:12.227
Thank you.

53:13.005 --> 53:14.666
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

53:14.840 --> 53:18.435
It's just my PoP hip. It comes from years
of doing our patented dance move.

53:18.610 --> 53:20.703
My God, I've suffered for my art.

53:20.879 --> 53:23.074
No, the thing that really hurts
is my upper gum.

53:23.248 --> 53:25.580
I think I may have impaled myself
on a dinner roll.

53:25.751 --> 53:28.686
Good thing they didn't have breadsticks.
I could've lost an eye.

53:28.854 --> 53:30.879
Well, you should get some ice on that.

53:31.056 --> 53:33.217
Only if it's attached to some whiskey.

53:33.392 --> 53:36.555
Oh, God. I can't believe
you convinced me to do that.

53:36.728 --> 53:39.822
Now I'm more of a joke to him than ever.

53:39.998 --> 53:40.987
And to top it off...

53:41.433 --> 53:44.800
...I'll have my own personal nightmare
playing on 3000 screens.

53:44.970 --> 53:47.700
And you know what the worst part is?

53:47.873 --> 53:49.568
You stole some poor woman's dress?

53:49.741 --> 53:54.371
The worst part is that
he still has some kind of power over me.

53:54.546 --> 53:56.571
I still care what he thinks.

53:56.748 --> 53:59.114
I'm sorry, but how?

53:59.284 --> 54:03.744
How can that possibly be?
The guy is a jerk.

54:05.023 --> 54:06.820
Well, that's easy for you to say, but--

54:06.992 --> 54:10.052
No. He is a jerk. He is a jerk.
It's not a question. He is a jerk.

54:10.229 --> 54:13.357
No, he is, he's a jerk. He's a jerk.
Okay, here's what I think.

54:13.532 --> 54:17.059
I think that the truth is that you are terrified
of losing Sally Michaels...

54:17.236 --> 54:21.673
...because you'd have nothing to hide behind
and you'd have to stand on your own feet.

54:24.443 --> 54:28.436
Wow. I didn't see that coming.

54:28.847 --> 54:30.439
No. Well...

54:30.616 --> 54:32.516
...I have amazing insight.

54:32.684 --> 54:35.448
I would use it on myself,
only I don't have any problems.

54:36.889 --> 54:38.720
And I will tell you my other insight.

54:38.891 --> 54:42.725
I think you are way too talented
and gifted...

54:42.895 --> 54:47.195
...and unusual to let anyone
keep you from standing.

54:51.603 --> 54:54.333
That's wonderfully sensitive, Alex.

54:54.506 --> 54:57.236
Especially from a man
who wears such tight pants.

54:57.776 --> 55:00.267
It forces all the blood to my heart.

55:09.351 --> 55:10.943
Listen.

55:11.487 --> 55:14.388
You were amazing tonight.

55:15.191 --> 55:16.556
As were you.

55:16.725 --> 55:19.387
The few syllables you got out
were absolutely devastating.

55:25.134 --> 55:26.829
Does this feel any better?

55:27.269 --> 55:29.464
It would if it was on the right side.

55:42.318 --> 55:43.979
And that...

55:45.487 --> 55:47.455
...felt much better.

56:45.214 --> 56:47.978
- Hello? Hello?
- <i>Hey, buddy.</i>

56:48.150 --> 56:49.742
How's my hit songwriter?

56:50.386 --> 56:51.751
Hang on. Just-- Just hang on.

56:53.155 --> 56:56.318
You don't sound right.
Maybe it's the connect-- Hello?

56:57.059 --> 56:58.890
I have a strange situation here.

56:59.061 --> 57:01.291
Oh, you've got a strange situation?

57:01.463 --> 57:05.763
I'm at Beth's soccer game with my ex-wife
who's here with my ex-gardener.

57:05.934 --> 57:08.027
They came on a riding mower.

57:08.203 --> 57:09.670
I slept with Sophie.

57:09.838 --> 57:12.602
You slept with Sophie?

57:12.775 --> 57:16.211
Remember your blood pressure.
You're a tall man. You need all you can get.

57:16.378 --> 57:19.438
Are you out of your mind?
Alex, this is terrible.

57:19.615 --> 57:23.676
Unless, of course, you're happy about it,
and then I couldn't be more pleased for you.

57:23.852 --> 57:25.843
- Should we do pros and cons?
- <i>Not necessary.</i>

57:27.456 --> 57:29.856
- I think she's up. I gotta go.
- <i>We got a show today.</i>

57:30.025 --> 57:32.425
Two o'clock. I'm gonna pick you up
in a little while.

57:32.594 --> 57:36.189
<i>I want you to wear the white shirt</i>
<i>with the fan-friendly pants.</i>

57:36.365 --> 57:38.890
Too much. Too much.
Hanging up on you. Hanging up.

57:39.768 --> 57:40.757
Good morning.

57:42.037 --> 57:44.733
- Hi.
- That was Chris just checking in.

57:45.541 --> 57:49.238
So I'm gonna help clean up a little bit...

57:49.411 --> 57:51.743
...seeing as we don't
have any work today.

57:51.914 --> 57:54.109
Right. Fine. Thank you. Very nice of you.

57:54.283 --> 57:57.719
I would obviously invite you to stay,
it's just that I have a show today.

57:58.387 --> 58:00.548
- Oh, really?
- Oh, yes. A big one.

58:00.723 --> 58:03.123
I'm headlining
at Adventureland Amusement Park:

58:03.292 --> 58:05.317
Long Island's family fun center.

58:05.494 --> 58:07.962
Biggest outdoor amusement center
east of Rye Playland.

58:08.130 --> 58:11.156
- You have my permission to be impressed.
- Sounds great.

58:11.333 --> 58:13.858
- Okay.
- Yeah.

58:14.036 --> 58:16.163
- So.
- So.

58:18.006 --> 58:19.496
I mean, you...

58:21.577 --> 58:23.442
You could come.

58:32.121 --> 58:35.022
<i>I said I wasn't gonna lose my head</i>

58:35.190 --> 58:39.854
- <i>But then pop goes my heart</i>
- <i>Pop goes my heart</i>

58:40.028 --> 58:42.553
<i>I wasn't gonna fall in love again</i>

58:42.731 --> 58:46.633
- <i>But then pop goes my heart</i>
- <i>Pop goes my heart</i>

58:46.802 --> 58:52.001
<i>And I just can't let you go</i>

58:52.174 --> 58:55.166
<i>I can't lose this feeling</i>

58:57.546 --> 58:59.343
Okay. Let's hear everyone clapping.

59:01.049 --> 59:05.281
Hey, come on. These guys over here on line
at the Little Dipper, let's hear you clapping.

59:08.123 --> 59:09.988
Don't-- Don't if you don't want to.

59:10.159 --> 59:13.185
<i>A twist of fate makes life worthwhile</i>

59:13.362 --> 59:18.322
<i>You are gold and silver</i>

59:18.500 --> 59:20.764
<i>I said I wasn't gonna lose my head</i>

59:20.936 --> 59:24.463
- <i>But then pop goes my heart</i>
- <i>Pop goes my heart</i>

59:24.640 --> 59:30.476
<i>And I just can't let you go</i>

59:35.384 --> 59:39.616
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Adventureland. Thank you.

59:40.756 --> 59:42.747
Thank you.

59:43.959 --> 59:46.393
That was great. That was great.

59:46.562 --> 59:48.621
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

59:48.797 --> 59:51.197
Good show.
All right, you gotta do the encore.

59:52.067 --> 59:55.230
- Do I really have to?
- It's in the contract.

59:55.404 --> 59:57.998
Wanna do "Meaningless Kiss"
or "Dance With Me Tonight"?

59:58.774 --> 01:00:00.708
This is embarrassing. They don't want it.

01:00:00.876 --> 01:00:03.674
No, it's not.
These songs, they're fantastic.

01:00:04.379 --> 01:00:06.506
I mean, I've never heard
most of them before...

01:00:06.682 --> 01:00:10.584
...but they're full of wonderful
melodic surprises and they're catchy...

01:00:10.752 --> 01:00:13.346
...and they're making people happy
and they're just good.

01:00:13.522 --> 01:00:15.888
So you should be incredibly proud
to sing them.

01:00:17.759 --> 01:00:20.728
You're not just saying that
because you've been on the wave ride?

01:00:20.896 --> 01:00:23.865
They're good, really good.

01:00:27.903 --> 01:00:31.270
Okay, then.
"Dance With Me Tonight," please.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:34.568
It's not often one man
gets to say that to another with such joy.

01:00:40.015 --> 01:00:41.642
Thank you.

01:00:43.819 --> 01:00:46.447
Okay. PoP face.

01:00:57.199 --> 01:00:59.099
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:01:06.909 --> 01:01:09.377
<i>It's been so long</i>

01:01:09.545 --> 01:01:12.343
<i>Since I've known right from wrong</i>

01:01:12.514 --> 01:01:14.311
<i>Got no job</i>

01:01:14.483 --> 01:01:17.919
<i>Sometimes I just sit down and sob</i>

01:01:18.086 --> 01:01:23.149
<i>Wondering if anything will go right</i>

01:01:24.726 --> 01:01:28.594
<i>Or will you dance with me tonight</i>

01:01:28.764 --> 01:01:30.698
<i>When the sun departs</i>

01:01:30.866 --> 01:01:34.029
<i>I feel a hole down in my heart</i>

01:01:34.202 --> 01:01:35.635
<i>Put on some shoes</i>

01:01:35.804 --> 01:01:39.763
<i>Come down here and listen to the blues</i>

01:01:39.942 --> 01:01:45.278
<i>Wondering if anything will go right</i>

01:01:46.548 --> 01:01:50.109
<i>Or will you dance with me tonight</i>

01:01:50.285 --> 01:01:52.719
<i>I'm looking at you</i>

01:01:52.888 --> 01:01:55.186
<i>You're looking at me</i>

01:01:55.357 --> 01:01:58.588
<i>We're the only two off the dance floor</i>

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.990
<i>Do you see what I see?</i>

01:02:01.163 --> 01:02:03.654
<i>Two broken lives</i>

01:02:03.832 --> 01:02:06.096
<i>Working in harmony</i>

01:02:06.268 --> 01:02:08.964
<i>Might make for a decent time</i>

01:02:09.137 --> 01:02:11.230
<i>So get up and dance with me</i>

01:02:13.241 --> 01:02:15.539
It was a great show.
You should be very pleased.

01:02:15.711 --> 01:02:17.303
How much money did we make?

01:02:17.479 --> 01:02:20.471
I don't talk business in front of a non-client.
You know that.

01:02:20.649 --> 01:02:23.209
Actually, I'm thinking
about signing with you.

01:02:23.819 --> 01:02:27.482
Well, well, thank you, Sophie.
That's-- That's terrific.

01:02:27.656 --> 01:02:31.592
In that case, I don't think it's right
to talk about one client's business affairs...

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.354
...in front of another client.
I'm discreet that way.

01:02:34.529 --> 01:02:37.589
You don't know how much money
we made, do you?

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.565
I have a ballpark figure.

01:02:39.735 --> 01:02:41.259
Is it enough for a nice dinner?

01:02:41.436 --> 01:02:44.269
Dinner. I'm supposed to go
to Rhonda's for dinner. I'm late.

01:02:44.439 --> 01:02:46.270
Oh, God, help.

01:02:46.441 --> 01:02:50.241
You know, she wouldn't yell at me
if you came.

01:02:52.914 --> 01:02:54.677
Oh, very well.

01:02:57.819 --> 01:02:59.650
I can't go.

01:03:04.893 --> 01:03:07.794
I'm losing my mind.
You've got me frazzled.

01:03:09.197 --> 01:03:12.894
- Oh, there you go. You're gonna love these.
- Thank you. That's plenty. Honestly.

01:03:13.068 --> 01:03:15.764
Trust me, you're gonna want
even more than that. Say when.

01:03:15.937 --> 01:03:19.202
When, when, when. Thank you.
Thank you. That's plenty. Thank you.

01:03:19.374 --> 01:03:20.773
- One more. Trust me.
- No.

01:03:20.942 --> 01:03:23.308
Listen, now, I don't wanna be
presumptuous...

01:03:23.478 --> 01:03:26.345
...but I'm about to open
a new Weight-Not in Boca...

01:03:26.515 --> 01:03:28.983
...and I was wondering
if maybe you'd like to perform.

01:03:29.151 --> 01:03:32.211
Sounds wonderful. I performed
at a fat farm once. They loved me.

01:03:32.387 --> 01:03:34.787
I threw out treats from the stage.
They went crazy.

01:03:34.956 --> 01:03:36.423
It was like a dietetic Altamont.

01:03:38.593 --> 01:03:39.582
That's funny.

01:03:39.761 --> 01:03:43.094
- Honey, no cellphones at the table.
- Could be Jessie about the meeting.

01:03:43.265 --> 01:03:46.826
If we break the rules, what'll the kids think?
Don't. Sorry, Alex. Very rude.

01:03:47.002 --> 01:03:49.994
Weirdo, is there a way
we could go to the Cora show?

01:03:50.172 --> 01:03:52.367
- That would be so cool.
- We could work that out.

01:03:52.541 --> 01:03:55.066
I believe we can.
I believe we've become close friends.

01:03:55.243 --> 01:03:56.938
Don't bug him with stuff like that.

01:03:57.112 --> 01:04:00.445
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Apologies.
I know the rules. Turn it off.

01:04:00.615 --> 01:04:03.277
Oh, no, honey. You go right ahead.
You're a guest.

01:04:03.452 --> 01:04:06.353
You sure? You want me
to call Jessie back while I'm...?

01:04:06.855 --> 01:04:08.152
I'll be very quick.

01:04:08.323 --> 01:04:11.087
Chris, yes? Say that again.
Cora's people what?

01:04:11.259 --> 01:04:12.954
What? Is it about the song?

01:04:13.328 --> 01:04:14.420
Really?

01:04:14.596 --> 01:04:16.029
- What does he say?
- It's Sophie.

01:04:16.765 --> 01:04:18.255
Really?

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:21.164
Okay. Okay, got it.

01:04:21.703 --> 01:04:23.170
Cora is back in town tomorrow...

01:04:23.338 --> 01:04:26.830
...and wants to meet us at her studio
to work on the song.

01:04:27.008 --> 01:04:30.102
And she wants to know
if we like wheatgrass.

01:04:30.278 --> 01:04:32.212
- Sounds ominous.
- Are you worried?

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:35.872
- Well, I don't-- You know, yeah.
- If you're not worried, I'm not worried.

01:04:36.051 --> 01:04:39.509
You've got your worried eyes.
You look like a little worried doggy.

01:04:50.031 --> 01:04:53.000
Sophie, bring those dishes in here, hon.

01:04:58.006 --> 01:05:01.134
Okay, honey. You lead, I'll follow.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.675
- There you go. There you go.
- What?

01:05:08.216 --> 01:05:09.808
Nothing. Just looking.

01:05:11.553 --> 01:05:13.817
What? What? What, what, what?

01:05:13.989 --> 01:05:17.584
- Well, look. As your older sister--
- Seven years older.

01:05:17.759 --> 01:05:19.124
Now, that's just uncalled for.

01:05:19.294 --> 01:05:21.888
Why do you do that?
It just-- It hurts, you know?

01:05:22.063 --> 01:05:26.124
Look. I like Alex, you know.
I mean, he's Alex Fletcher. So hot.

01:05:26.301 --> 01:05:27.700
And he ate my mashed potatoes.

01:05:27.869 --> 01:05:29.461
Yes. It was a magical evening.

01:05:29.638 --> 01:05:31.833
But look, hon, you don't fall a lot.

01:05:32.007 --> 01:05:35.534
And I've seen the way you look at him,
so if you are falling for him...

01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:39.202
...just please, please make sure
he's passionate about you.

01:05:39.381 --> 01:05:43.715
Well, you know, I mean, I'm not falling.
We're just working together, you know?

01:05:43.885 --> 01:05:47.582
And besides, the one time we slept
together, it's been totally professional.

01:05:47.756 --> 01:05:49.223
- You did not.
- I did.

01:05:49.391 --> 01:05:51.291
You slept with Alex Fletcher?

01:05:51.459 --> 01:05:52.687
Oh, my God.

01:05:53.862 --> 01:05:55.523
Don't worry about it, all right?

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:03.030
Besides, you know,
how do you know who's passionate?

01:06:04.573 --> 01:06:08.339
You know, I think you--
I think you just see it in their eyes.

01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:11.104
And you feel it in their touch.

01:06:11.513 --> 01:06:15.074
In Gary's case, it was when he said
to his mother, "I'm marrying her anyway."

01:06:15.784 --> 01:06:17.411
God, I hate her.

01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:21.987
I don't know. I think it's just
when they do something extraordinary.

01:06:22.924 --> 01:06:25.449
Soph, just be careful, okay?

01:06:25.627 --> 01:06:27.094
Okay.

01:06:32.634 --> 01:06:36.593
And bigger. And bigger. And bigger.

01:06:38.473 --> 01:06:40.304
With claps, and:

01:06:42.377 --> 01:06:45.278
Ready to spin. And:

01:06:51.386 --> 01:06:53.946
Well, that was fun.

01:06:54.122 --> 01:06:56.386
It was, it was, it was.
Except for those potatoes.

01:06:56.558 --> 01:06:58.924
What I imagine eating insulation
would taste like.

01:07:00.295 --> 01:07:02.991
So Cora tomorrow?

01:07:03.164 --> 01:07:06.497
Yes, tomorrow, 10:00,
her studio, 19th Street.

01:07:07.435 --> 01:07:10.427
- Should I meet you there?
- That would be fine.

01:07:10.605 --> 01:07:12.368
Although I was gonna take a cab.

01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:14.735
And seeing as I live
further uptown than you...

01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:17.174
...I could, theoretically, pick you up.

01:07:17.779 --> 01:07:21.271
You could if I was on the street
at, say, like, 9:40.

01:07:21.449 --> 01:07:24.475
I would probably see you, depending
how brightly you were dressed.

01:07:24.653 --> 01:07:26.553
I'd wear orange so you couldn't miss me.

01:07:26.721 --> 01:07:28.985
You could get some road work done
while you wait.

01:07:34.896 --> 01:07:38.423
Well, goodbye and thank you.
Thank you very much for this. I enjoyed it.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:42.229
- And thank you for your support today.
- Thank you. Today was great.

01:07:43.305 --> 01:07:45.364
- It was.
- Okay. Bye.

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:47.098
Goodbye.

01:07:54.783 --> 01:07:55.807
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:08:28.183 --> 01:08:31.640
I want you to hear the new intro
to "Way Back Into Love."

01:08:31.819 --> 01:08:33.048
So imagine this:

01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:35.689
Instead of just starting the song
with the piano...

01:08:35.857 --> 01:08:40.294
...we get this heavy Indian thing going,
very rhythmic.

01:08:43.732 --> 01:08:47.725
Derek, give me a beat:
steamy and sticky.

01:08:54.376 --> 01:08:57.937
<i>Way back into love</i>

01:08:58.113 --> 01:09:02.345
<i>She's been living</i>
<i>With a shadow overhead</i>

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:10.550
<i>She's been sleeping</i>
<i>With a cloud above her bed</i>

01:09:13.962 --> 01:09:16.522
<i>Go Cora, go Cora</i>

01:09:17.866 --> 01:09:23.304
<i>Cora Corman and Alex Fletcher</i>
<i>Got a new song that's gonna getcha</i>

01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:27.032
<i>Way back into love</i>

01:09:27.207 --> 01:09:30.974
<i>Way back into love</i>

01:09:32.346 --> 01:09:35.942
<i>Way back into love</i>

01:09:38.987 --> 01:09:42.582
You know, I think that I will get
some wheatgrass after all.

01:09:44.859 --> 01:09:47.555
- You don't like it?
- No. No, no, no, it's not that.

01:09:47.729 --> 01:09:50.162
She had her eye on that wheatgrass
since we came in.

01:09:50.331 --> 01:09:52.424
What you're doing,
that thing there, is great.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.899
It's steamy and it's sticky, you know.

01:09:56.071 --> 01:09:59.097
Which is-- One is normally enough,
but the combo's just amazing.

01:09:59.274 --> 01:10:00.707
C, time for the press shoot.

01:10:01.209 --> 01:10:03.006
I really like what we came up with.

01:10:03.711 --> 01:10:07.010
Oh, and add another verse.
It doesn't feel like the song ends yet.

01:10:07.182 --> 01:10:09.343
Another verse? Right.
That would be an honor, C.

01:10:09.517 --> 01:10:12.281
I'm having a little pre-recording session
party at my place.

01:10:12.454 --> 01:10:14.479
I want you both to come.

01:10:15.056 --> 01:10:16.182
Great.

01:10:16.357 --> 01:10:19.258
I think though, that--
That there-- But wait--

01:10:19.461 --> 01:10:21.361
Cheers. Thanks a lot, Ray.

01:10:21.529 --> 01:10:23.997
Thanks, Derek. Nice one.

01:10:24.165 --> 01:10:26.725
Don't speak. Don't say anything.

01:10:28.736 --> 01:10:32.570
You didn't actually like that orgasm
set to the <i>Gandhi</i> soundtrack, did you?

01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:35.766
Well, I thought it was,
you know, horrible.

01:10:35.944 --> 01:10:40.005
I mean, it simultaneously destroyed
two musical cultures in under a minute.

01:10:40.181 --> 01:10:41.307
We have to tell her.

01:10:41.483 --> 01:10:42.973
No, no. I don't think we do.

01:10:43.151 --> 01:10:45.381
Honestly, if she wants to dance,
let her dance.

01:10:45.553 --> 01:10:48.613
I don't understand. Wait. I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:53.090
Your heroes, the Beatles, Smokey,
they would never let this happen.

01:10:53.261 --> 01:10:55.821
That's a completely different thing.
They were geniuses.

01:10:55.997 --> 01:10:58.591
They wrote dinner. I write dessert.

01:10:58.766 --> 01:11:00.597
No. You're better than dessert.

01:11:00.768 --> 01:11:03.328
That's why I'm gonna tell her
what I think at the party.

01:11:03.505 --> 01:11:05.268
- You are not gonna do that.
- Yes, I am.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.737
- No, you are not.
- Yes, I am.

01:11:06.908 --> 01:11:09.001
In that case, you are no longer invited.

01:11:09.177 --> 01:11:11.475
What? She invited me.

01:11:11.646 --> 01:11:13.136
She invited us, as a team.

01:11:13.314 --> 01:11:16.078
Now that we disagree,
we no longer present a united front...

01:11:16.251 --> 01:11:19.049
...and are thus un-teamed
for the purposes of the invitation.

01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:20.209
So are you going?

01:11:20.388 --> 01:11:23.289
- I might. I don't wanna be rude.
- I don't wanna be rude either.

01:11:23.458 --> 01:11:25.517
You don't think that telling the hostess...

01:11:25.693 --> 01:11:28.321
...that she's destroyed
two musical cultures is rude?

01:11:28.496 --> 01:11:30.088
I'm enrolling you in charm school.

01:11:30.265 --> 01:11:32.893
I have to say what I think.
I can't work this way.

01:11:33.067 --> 01:11:35.968
You can't work this way?
You've been a songwriter for six days.

01:11:36.137 --> 01:11:37.900
God created the universe in six days.

01:11:38.072 --> 01:11:42.304
And he never had a hit. Okay, he did.
He had "He's Got the Whole World in..."

01:11:42.477 --> 01:11:43.967
I'm going to the party.

01:11:44.145 --> 01:11:47.205
You are not going to the party.
You, young lady, are grounded.

01:11:47.382 --> 01:11:49.612
You're grounded. Come back here.

01:11:49.784 --> 01:11:53.117
- Please. I'm a little bit desperate. Please.
- I'll see you there.

01:11:53.288 --> 01:11:57.156
You won't. You won't because
you're not invited. They won't let you in.

01:12:11.573 --> 01:12:13.734
- Hey, Ray.
- Alex, my man.

01:12:13.908 --> 01:12:16.172
- How are you?
- I'm good, man. How you doing?

01:12:16.344 --> 01:12:17.606
So is Sophie here?

01:12:17.779 --> 01:12:20.373
You know what?
I haven't seen her. Yeah.

01:12:20.548 --> 01:12:21.913
- Chris?
- Who?

01:12:22.083 --> 01:12:24.313
- You know, my manager.
- I'm sorry. Have fun.

01:12:24.485 --> 01:12:27.613
- Yeah.
- Hey, Michelle. Good to see you, babe.

01:12:27.789 --> 01:12:28.778
Hey, how's it going?

01:12:33.728 --> 01:12:35.593
Hey, Ray, what's up, man?

01:12:36.130 --> 01:12:37.757
How's it going?

01:13:03.224 --> 01:13:04.213
Hey.

01:13:04.392 --> 01:13:05.723
- Where's Sophie?
- Hang on.

01:13:06.327 --> 01:13:09.990
Hang on. God, she's here. Please
don't let her through. Don't let her through.

01:13:10.164 --> 01:13:12.928
We cannot let her talk to Cora.
She's gonna ruin everything.

01:13:13.101 --> 01:13:14.830
- Who?
- Sophie. She hates the song.

01:13:15.003 --> 01:13:17.494
- She hates the song you wrote?
- Yes. She hates it.

01:13:17.672 --> 01:13:20.869
But she wrote the song.
Why does she hate it?

01:13:21.042 --> 01:13:23.476
We had a little disagreement.

01:13:23.645 --> 01:13:25.237
Hi there, Soph, how are you?

01:13:25.413 --> 01:13:27.643
- Hey, Sophie.
- Good evening.

01:13:27.815 --> 01:13:30.648
So you brought something,
did you, Sophie?

01:13:30.818 --> 01:13:33.616
Yes. My mother told me,
"Never go to a party empty-handed"...

01:13:33.788 --> 01:13:38.248
...so I went to the Zen Eatery and got
a selection of cookies. No, thank you.

01:13:38.426 --> 01:13:40.087
Nirvana Nougat.

01:13:44.866 --> 01:13:47.027
Hey. It's my favorite writers.

01:13:47.201 --> 01:13:48.532
Hi, C. How are you?

01:13:48.703 --> 01:13:50.694
We brought you some cookies,
from all of us.

01:13:51.272 --> 01:13:53.536
Thank you. Derek.

01:13:53.708 --> 01:13:55.471
Cora, I really wanted to talk to you--

01:13:55.643 --> 01:13:58.111
About the fact that
we're gonna have to leave early...

01:13:58.279 --> 01:14:00.941
...to finish this song
which has become important to us...

01:14:01.115 --> 01:14:03.106
...in both an artistic and spiritual sense.

01:14:03.284 --> 01:14:05.514
You can't leave yet. Come see the house.

01:14:05.687 --> 01:14:08.815
I wanna show you the roof. It's upstairs.

01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:11.185
Do you know--? Well...

01:14:13.928 --> 01:14:18.365
Cora, I definitely see how much
you've thought about the song and--

01:14:18.533 --> 01:14:21.866
Great roof. In a very interesting place
as well, right at the top--

01:14:22.036 --> 01:14:25.494
- Sophie was about to say something.
- Was she? I don't think she was. No.

01:14:25.673 --> 01:14:28.699
She looks like she's about
to say something, then just... clams up.

01:14:28.876 --> 01:14:33.279
What I wanted to say is that I appreciate
that you're bringing thought to the music...

01:14:33.448 --> 01:14:37.282
...but I really and honestly feel
that we're pandering.

01:14:39.654 --> 01:14:43.385
Which means trying to make others like you,
which I think is a really nice thing.

01:14:43.558 --> 01:14:46.254
I do a lot of it.
"Just going out pandering, be back soon."

01:14:46.427 --> 01:14:50.830
The song is about the struggle, you know,
to show your true feelings.

01:14:50.998 --> 01:14:53.933
And your very confident sexual display...

01:14:54.102 --> 01:14:58.095
...is, you know, a total contradiction
of the fear and insecurity.

01:14:58.272 --> 01:15:01.435
No, I don't think so.
And my fans really love it when I dance.

01:15:01.609 --> 01:15:03.907
- You're a wonderful dancer.
- That's a fair point.

01:15:04.078 --> 01:15:07.445
- My last CD only went to number two.
- But in this case, if you trust us--

01:15:07.615 --> 01:15:11.244
And Shakira is breathing down my neck.
So I wanna dance.

01:15:13.287 --> 01:15:15.551
You shall dance.

01:15:16.190 --> 01:15:20.490
But thank you for your honesty, Sophie.
Cherish your passion.

01:15:20.661 --> 01:15:24.529
- Well, thank you.
- Cora, Timberlake's here. Wants to say hi.

01:15:24.799 --> 01:15:26.596
Nice to see you, C. Talk to you later.

01:15:26.768 --> 01:15:29.032
And I'm looking forward
to the new last verse.

01:15:29.203 --> 01:15:30.397
- Cora, wait.
- It's over.

01:15:30.571 --> 01:15:33.165
It was a very nice try,
but you have hit the karmic wall.

01:15:33.341 --> 01:15:37.402
With no help from you.
You just stood there. Talk about pandering.

01:15:37.578 --> 01:15:40.240
I did not pander. I just told her
what she wanted to hear.

01:15:40.415 --> 01:15:42.815
- I'm gonna go tell her the truth.
- You just did.

01:15:42.984 --> 01:15:45.578
Are you gonna use flash cards this time?
You're stubborn.

01:15:45.753 --> 01:15:48.722
And you're not stubborn enough
to stand up for what's good.

01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:52.121
I mean, I just don't wanna see you
do what you did on your solo album.

01:15:52.293 --> 01:15:53.624
Yes, yes, yes.

01:15:55.096 --> 01:15:57.564
I bought it. The last copy.

01:15:58.466 --> 01:16:01.060
All right, well, I insist
on paying you back immediately.

01:16:01.235 --> 01:16:02.668
9.99, right? Do you have a penny?

01:16:02.837 --> 01:16:05.499
You were trying so hard to get a hit
that it wasn't you.

01:16:05.673 --> 01:16:07.766
The songs were soulless.

01:16:07.942 --> 01:16:10.570
I agree. But ours has soul, so...

01:16:10.745 --> 01:16:14.078
But not if we ruin it. And you know that.
Why are you so scared to care?

01:16:14.248 --> 01:16:16.341
Because it won't matter.

01:16:16.517 --> 01:16:20.419
Because behind
all her Buddhism-in-a-thong philosophy...

01:16:20.588 --> 01:16:23.853
...what she cares about
is seats filled and units sold.

01:16:24.025 --> 01:16:25.686
Nothing's gonna make her your pal...

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:28.158
...any more than years with Colin
made him mine.

01:16:28.329 --> 01:16:30.763
Because in the end, it's all just business.

01:16:30.932 --> 01:16:32.832
- What is?
- All of it. Everything.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.968
That's why they call it
the music business.

01:16:35.136 --> 01:16:37.900
It's a good thing.
I wish everything in life was that clear.

01:16:38.072 --> 01:16:40.540
I want something from you,
you want something from me.

01:16:40.708 --> 01:16:42.232
No false promises or expectations.

01:16:45.847 --> 01:16:47.314
Well.

01:16:47.482 --> 01:16:49.712
Congratulations on your feel-good song.

01:16:52.553 --> 01:16:54.077
Can I get you a drink?

01:17:21.582 --> 01:17:24.551
There's plenty of time.
We have the night, part of the morning...

01:17:24.719 --> 01:17:26.619
...teeniest little bit of the afternoon.

01:17:56.150 --> 01:17:58.641
I can't read it.
What does that--? What does that say?

01:17:59.387 --> 01:18:01.287
"Sorry, I can't do this."

01:18:06.394 --> 01:18:10.330
<i>Sorry, I can't do this</i>

01:18:11.866 --> 01:18:15.302
Not sure about the scansion.
What--? What, are you leaving?

01:18:15.469 --> 01:18:19.667
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Maybe I'll think of something later.

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:22.502
There is no later.
She needs the song tomorrow.

01:18:22.677 --> 01:18:25.612
If we don't give it to her,
she's gonna go to someone else.

01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:27.145
I will have lost the job.

01:18:27.315 --> 01:18:29.442
I'm sorry.

01:18:30.251 --> 01:18:32.981
- Okay, look.
- No, I want to help. I do.

01:18:33.154 --> 01:18:35.452
I wanna help you finish, but I can't.

01:18:35.623 --> 01:18:39.923
I can't write when I feel like this.
I'm not inspired.

01:18:40.094 --> 01:18:44.463
I don't care. I don't care if you're inspired.
Inspiration's for amateurs.

01:18:44.632 --> 01:18:48.124
I just want four lines. Please.
I just want four lines.

01:18:48.302 --> 01:18:51.169
- I can't.
- Oh, but you can and you won't.

01:18:51.339 --> 01:18:54.706
- Are you saying I wanted this to happen?
- I'm saying that's what you do.

01:18:54.875 --> 01:18:57.207
You push and push
and move the furniture around...

01:18:57.378 --> 01:18:59.073
...and talk all the time...

01:18:59.246 --> 01:19:01.680
...and screw everything up
just like he said.

01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:04.811
Who's he? What are you talking about?
What are you saying?

01:19:04.986 --> 01:19:07.750
I read the book because I wanted
to come to you and say:

01:19:07.922 --> 01:19:11.653
"You're not at all like Sally Michaels."
But actually, he's got you spot on.

01:19:11.826 --> 01:19:15.387
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying Sloan Cates was right.

01:19:16.464 --> 01:19:20.457
Oh, my God. Please take that back.

01:19:20.635 --> 01:19:24.093
The poor, innocent, helpless
"'I can't write,' she says to herself" girl...

01:19:24.271 --> 01:19:26.296
...has co-authored
three-quarters of a hit...

01:19:26.474 --> 01:19:29.602
...and is holding it ransom
because she can't get what she wants.

01:19:29.777 --> 01:19:33.235
You think life is this fairy tale.

01:19:33.414 --> 01:19:37.043
When it turns out that everything
doesn't end happily, you can't deal with it.

01:19:58.305 --> 01:20:03.607
<i>Mama says I can't, Daddy says I can</i>
<i>But now my body just wants to slam</i>

01:20:04.879 --> 01:20:06.403
<i>Slam</i>

01:20:07.381 --> 01:20:10.748
- C, Alex Fletcher is here.
- Hey, Alex.

01:20:11.218 --> 01:20:14.449
C, could I--? Could I have a quick word?
Thanks a lot.

01:20:14.822 --> 01:20:17.222
- Derek, how are you? Good to see you.
- Alex Fletcher.

01:20:20.261 --> 01:20:22.354
Yo, so how's my girl Sophie, man?

01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:25.158
Yeah, no, she's keeping it pretty real.

01:20:25.332 --> 01:20:27.027
Yeah, what a girl.

01:20:27.201 --> 01:20:31.262
C, hi. Listen, it's about
the new last verse.

01:20:31.439 --> 01:20:34.499
It's not completely formed
in the classical sense yet.

01:20:34.675 --> 01:20:38.133
It's more a kind of string of words
that you can connect in almost any way.

01:20:38.312 --> 01:20:40.576
- I think it's quite innovative.
- I got the lyrics.

01:20:40.748 --> 01:20:44.479
Sophie faxed them over this morning.
They are so beautiful.

01:20:44.652 --> 01:20:46.916
It's what I always wanted to say
to my boyfriend.

01:20:47.088 --> 01:20:49.921
It's the perfect end to the song.

01:20:50.291 --> 01:20:54.921
<i>There are moments</i>
<i>When I don't know if it's real</i>

01:20:55.096 --> 01:20:59.931
<i>Or if anybody feels the way I feel</i>

01:21:00.101 --> 01:21:03.161
<i>I need inspiration</i>

01:21:03.938 --> 01:21:09.672
<i>Not just another negotiation</i>

01:21:11.312 --> 01:21:16.648
<i>All I wanna do</i>
<i>Is find a way back into...</i>

01:21:17.818 --> 01:21:20.378
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Sorry, sorry.

01:21:20.554 --> 01:21:23.648
I just-- I just completely,
I don't know, spaced out.

01:21:23.824 --> 01:21:26.554
That's okay. Let's take it from the top
with the new intro.

01:21:26.727 --> 01:21:28.524
Yep. Great.

01:21:30.431 --> 01:21:34.527
<i>Yeah, Cora Corman and Alex Fletcher</i>

01:21:34.702 --> 01:21:36.693
<i>Way back into love</i>

01:21:42.343 --> 01:21:43.332
Hi.

01:21:43.978 --> 01:21:45.536
Hello.

01:21:46.247 --> 01:21:50.149
I bought these for your children because
one should never show up empty-handed.

01:21:50.718 --> 01:21:55.087
They're aliens.
Clearly, I have no children. Here.

01:21:55.256 --> 01:21:58.054
- Here, let me get that for you.
- Thank you.

01:22:01.195 --> 01:22:04.687
I am gonna go to the office.

01:22:05.299 --> 01:22:08.063
- I am too. Have fun with those.
- Bye.

01:22:14.375 --> 01:22:16.639
Put them there, thanks.

01:22:18.679 --> 01:22:20.408
You coming to the concert tomorrow?

01:22:20.848 --> 01:22:22.907
Can't disappoint Lucy.

01:22:23.083 --> 01:22:25.278
Yes, yes, very important.

01:22:26.187 --> 01:22:30.851
Chris is bringing his daughter as well,
so should be fun.

01:22:31.192 --> 01:22:34.127
I just wanted to say
I thought your last verse was fantastic.

01:22:34.562 --> 01:22:35.551
Thank you, Alex.

01:22:36.530 --> 01:22:38.862
And I'm very sorry about what I said.

01:22:39.033 --> 01:22:42.662
Well, you know, life isn't a fairy tale
and I have to grow up...

01:22:42.837 --> 01:22:44.702
...and I'm gonna do that in Florida.

01:22:45.372 --> 01:22:47.340
Well, that's just ridiculous.

01:22:47.508 --> 01:22:50.773
No one grows up in Florida.
Unless they're an orange.

01:22:50.945 --> 01:22:53.743
Well, I'm managing
the new Weight-Not branch in Boca Raton.

01:22:53.914 --> 01:22:56.576
You should be writing,
not fighting cellulite.

01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:59.310
Well, I can do both.
We need a new marketing campaign.

01:22:59.486 --> 01:23:01.249
Swimsuit season is coming up.

01:23:02.823 --> 01:23:04.415
Thing is...

01:23:05.826 --> 01:23:07.919
...I can't...

01:23:11.498 --> 01:23:13.796
...compose without you.

01:23:13.968 --> 01:23:16.835
Thanks, but I don't think
it's a good idea.

01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:23.574
All right. You're obviously very busy.

01:23:29.016 --> 01:23:30.608
Good luck.

01:23:31.452 --> 01:23:32.749
You too.

01:25:20.027 --> 01:25:21.688
Cora!

01:25:26.166 --> 01:25:28.896
- Gracie, aren't you excited?
- Let's go.

01:25:30.604 --> 01:25:34.597
You know what? You guys, just go.
I think I'm gonna skip it.

01:25:34.775 --> 01:25:37.243
- No, come on. You can't skip it.
- You know what, kids?

01:25:37.411 --> 01:25:39.879
I'm gonna talk to your aunt, okay?
Gary, take them in.

01:25:40.047 --> 01:25:42.072
- Should I meet you--?
- Do it. How hard is it?

01:25:42.249 --> 01:25:43.739
- Go, walk, sit.
- Find your seats.

01:25:43.917 --> 01:25:46.852
Honey, I need a second. Thank you.
Love you. You're a good man.

01:25:47.021 --> 01:25:48.215
Now, listen to me.

01:25:48.389 --> 01:25:52.951
Those kids have told all of their friends
that their aunt wrote Cora's new hit song.

01:25:53.127 --> 01:25:55.721
And they wanna share this with you.
You gotta go in.

01:25:55.896 --> 01:25:58.831
Yeah. No, I know. I know. I just...

01:25:58.999 --> 01:26:02.730
I don't know how I'm gonna go in there
and look at him.

01:26:03.937 --> 01:26:07.134
I know. It's just one night, though,
and I really think you need this.

01:26:07.307 --> 01:26:11.835
And then he'll go his way
and you'll go yours. Okay?

01:26:16.450 --> 01:26:18.680
Do you have her autograph?

01:26:18.852 --> 01:26:20.114
- Isn't this exciting?
- Yeah.

01:26:20.721 --> 01:26:21.745
This is so cool.

01:26:22.556 --> 01:26:25.423
- Yeah, weirdo. This is so cool.
- It's great.

01:26:25.592 --> 01:26:27.924
We're in the Cora fan club.
Can we? Please, Mom?

01:26:28.095 --> 01:26:30.791
- Okay.
- Cora!

01:26:52.653 --> 01:26:54.587
Cora!

01:26:54.755 --> 01:26:55.983
Cora!

01:27:06.533 --> 01:27:08.194
Cora!

01:27:32.793 --> 01:27:36.024
- Look, there she is!
- Is that Cora?

01:27:52.546 --> 01:27:53.945
<i>I'm starting to believe, boy</i>

01:27:55.115 --> 01:27:56.548
<i>That this was meant to be, boy</i>

01:27:56.717 --> 01:27:59.379
<i>'Cause I believe in karma</i>

01:27:59.553 --> 01:28:02.021
<i>Boy, do you believe in karma?</i>

01:28:04.892 --> 01:28:08.851
<i>Each time you put your lips to mine</i>
<i>It's like a taste of Buddha's delight</i>

01:28:09.029 --> 01:28:14.763
- Hey, Gary.
- Come on. I'm just watching.

01:28:15.903 --> 01:28:18.895
<i>Tell me all your fantasies tonight</i>

01:28:19.072 --> 01:28:20.664
<i>And I will make them happen 'cause</i>

01:28:20.841 --> 01:28:25.369
<i>I'm not satisfied if I don't get</i>

01:28:25.546 --> 01:28:27.912
<i>My Buddha's delight</i>

01:28:28.649 --> 01:28:31.379
<i>Om shanti, shanti</i>

01:28:33.487 --> 01:28:38.982
<i>This Tuesday on The CW,</i>
<i>it's</i> Battle of the '80s Has-Beens <i>...</i>

01:28:39.159 --> 01:28:42.390
<i>...featuring Tiffany battling</i>
<i>reigning champion Debbie Gibson...</i>

01:28:42.563 --> 01:28:45.225
<i>...followed by a bout</i>
<i>between Adam Ant and Billy Idol.</i>

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:48.966
<i>Tuesday night on The CW.</i>

01:28:50.370 --> 01:28:52.702
Five minutes, Mr. Fletcher.

01:28:55.342 --> 01:28:59.938
<i>Entering Bootytown</i>
<i>So shake my booty now</i>

01:29:00.113 --> 01:29:05.710
<i>'Cause your booty</i>
<i>Is the way into his heart</i>

01:29:20.033 --> 01:29:22.194
New York, I love you!

01:29:24.438 --> 01:29:25.700
Shanti, shanti.

01:29:25.872 --> 01:29:27.066
What's that mean?

01:29:27.241 --> 01:29:30.176
And now I'd like you to hear
something very special.

01:29:30.344 --> 01:29:33.370
- Oh, Soph.
- Something very different.

01:29:33.547 --> 01:29:35.014
It's a new song.

01:29:35.182 --> 01:29:37.173
This is it, weirdo, your song.

01:29:38.418 --> 01:29:41.819
- I don't think I can listen to this.
- A song no one has heard before...

01:29:41.989 --> 01:29:45.618
...written by Mr. Alex Fletcher.

01:29:45.792 --> 01:29:46.781
Wait.

01:29:52.799 --> 01:29:55.927
What? Alex Fletcher and my sister.

01:29:56.103 --> 01:29:57.502
How quickly they forget.

01:29:58.705 --> 01:30:01.538
Let's just go and come back
when the song's over. You and me.

01:30:03.810 --> 01:30:05.641
- Actually, I'm gonna go.
- No. What?

01:30:05.812 --> 01:30:07.837
- Yeah, no. I'm fine. Just...
- Are you sure?

01:30:08.015 --> 01:30:11.246
Yeah, I'm fine. I just wanna be alone.
Just take care of the kids.

01:30:32.339 --> 01:30:35.069
<i>It's never been easy for me</i>

01:30:36.877 --> 01:30:40.608
<i>To find words to go along with a melody</i>

01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:48.119
<i>But this time there's actually</i>
<i>Something on my mind</i>

01:30:50.157 --> 01:30:54.753
<i>So please forgive</i>
<i>These few brief awkward lines</i>

01:30:56.930 --> 01:31:00.923
<i>Since I met you</i>
<i>My whole life has changed</i>

01:31:03.337 --> 01:31:07.865
<i>It's not just my furniture</i>
<i>You've rearranged</i>

01:31:10.043 --> 01:31:15.743
<i>I was living in the past</i>
<i>But somehow you've brought me back</i>

01:31:16.249 --> 01:31:21.744
<i>And I haven't felt like this</i>
<i>Since before Frankie said, "Relax"</i>

01:31:21.922 --> 01:31:24.413
<i>And though I know</i>

01:31:24.591 --> 01:31:27.560
<i>Based on my track record</i>

01:31:27.728 --> 01:31:30.720
<i>I might not seem like the safest bet</i>

01:31:34.167 --> 01:31:36.431
<i>All I'm asking you</i>

01:31:37.003 --> 01:31:40.905
<i>Is don't write me off just yet</i>

01:31:52.419 --> 01:31:56.412
<i>For years I've been telling myself</i>
<i>The same old story</i>

01:31:58.625 --> 01:32:03.187
<i>That I'm happy to live off</i>
<i>My so-called former glories</i>

01:32:05.065 --> 01:32:11.004
<i>But you've given me a reason</i>
<i>To take another chance</i>

01:32:11.505 --> 01:32:16.966
<i>Now I need you despite the fact</i>
<i>That you've killed all my plants</i>

01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:19.369
<i>And though I know</i>

01:32:19.546 --> 01:32:22.572
<i>I've already blown more chances</i>

01:32:22.749 --> 01:32:25.775
<i>Than anyone should ever get</i>

01:32:29.689 --> 01:32:32.180
<i>All I'm asking you</i>

01:32:32.359 --> 01:32:36.125
<i>Is don't write me off just yet</i>

01:32:39.399 --> 01:32:43.961
<i>Don't write me off just yet</i>

01:33:01.555 --> 01:33:03.182
Alex!

01:33:25.212 --> 01:33:27.772
- Nobody backstage.
- I have to get up there. I know Cora.

01:33:27.948 --> 01:33:30.746
- I don't care what you want.
- I know Cora. I wrote this song.

01:33:30.917 --> 01:33:31.906
She's okay.

01:33:32.085 --> 01:33:34.519
- There's nobody backstage.
- I said she's okay, right?

01:33:34.688 --> 01:33:36.679
- Well, you vouch for her, then.
- Thank you.

01:33:36.857 --> 01:33:37.949
What's wrong with you?

01:33:38.124 --> 01:33:40.649
As soon as Cora's done "Slam,"
we'll need you on-stage.

01:33:40.827 --> 01:33:43.261
Okay, got it. Got it.
Thanks very much. Cheers.

01:33:44.898 --> 01:33:46.923
<i>Slam</i>

01:33:47.534 --> 01:33:52.938
<i>Mama says I can't, Daddy says I can</i>
<i>But now my body just wants to slam</i>

01:33:54.241 --> 01:33:55.401
<i>Slam</i>

01:33:57.344 --> 01:33:59.209
Come to a concert, don't bring anything?

01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:02.874
Alex, that song.

01:34:03.049 --> 01:34:06.314
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
It's the best I could do. You could fix it.

01:34:06.486 --> 01:34:09.580
No. That song was dinner.

01:34:13.059 --> 01:34:15.323
<i>Mama says I can't, Daddy says I can</i>

01:34:18.832 --> 01:34:19.958
Thank you!

01:34:23.503 --> 01:34:26.563
I want you to hear my new single.

01:34:27.407 --> 01:34:29.136
Thank you!

01:34:29.309 --> 01:34:34.076
"Way Back Into Love," music and lyrics
by Sophie Fisher and Alex Fletcher.

01:34:34.247 --> 01:34:36.715
What happened to steamy and sticky?

01:34:36.883 --> 01:34:39.909
I explained to Cora that it violated
the very core of the lyric...

01:34:40.086 --> 01:34:41.951
...and corrupted the purity of the song.

01:34:42.122 --> 01:34:45.057
When that didn't work, I told her
it would help me win you back.

01:34:45.225 --> 01:34:46.487
And that did it.

01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:50.994
Turns out that although she thought
the Dalai Lama was, incredibly, a Ilama...

01:34:51.164 --> 01:34:53.359
...she is, in fact, quite the romantic.

01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:56.000
- Go. Go. Go.
- Okay, Mr. Fletcher.

01:34:56.169 --> 01:34:57.636
Thank you.

01:34:57.804 --> 01:35:03.003
<i>Trapped in the past</i>
<i>I just can't seem to move on</i>

01:35:03.176 --> 01:35:07.704
<i>I've been hiding all my hopes</i>
<i>And dreams away</i>

01:35:07.881 --> 01:35:12.682
<i>Just in case I ever need 'em</i>
<i>Again someday</i>

01:35:12.852 --> 01:35:15.844
<i>I've been setting aside time</i>

01:35:16.856 --> 01:35:21.987
<i>To clear a little space</i>
<i>In the corners of my mind</i>

01:35:22.996 --> 01:35:28.992
<i>All I wanna do</i>
<i>Is find a way back into love</i>

01:35:32.672 --> 01:35:39.635
<i>I can't make it through</i>
<i>Without a way back into love</i>

01:35:46.319 --> 01:35:50.813
<i>I've been watching</i>
<i>But the stars refuse to shine</i>

01:35:50.991 --> 01:35:55.826
<i>I've been searching</i>
<i>But I just don't see the signs</i>

01:35:55.996 --> 01:35:59.727
<i>I know that it's out there</i>

01:35:59.899 --> 01:36:05.166
<i>There's gotta be something</i>
<i>For my soul somewhere</i>

01:36:05.338 --> 01:36:09.536
<i>I've been looking for someone</i>
<i>To shed some light</i>

01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:14.009
<i>Not somebody just to get me</i>
<i>Through the night</i>

01:36:14.381 --> 01:36:17.407
<i>I could use some direction</i>

01:36:19.219 --> 01:36:23.315
<i>And I'm open to your suggestions</i>

01:36:24.190 --> 01:36:30.857
<i>All I wanna do</i>
<i>Is find a way back into love</i>

01:36:33.566 --> 01:36:40.096
<i>I can't make it through</i>
<i>Without a way back into love</i>

01:36:41.207 --> 01:36:45.576
<i>And if I open my heart to you</i>

01:36:45.745 --> 01:36:50.148
<i>I'm hoping you'll show me what to do</i>

01:36:50.316 --> 01:36:54.480
<i>And if you help me to start again</i>

01:36:55.588 --> 01:37:02.494
<i>You know that I'll be there</i>
<i>For you in the end</i>

01:37:03.305 --> 01:37:09.499
