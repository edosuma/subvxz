00:08.138 --> 00:11.258
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:11.259 --> 00:14.498
sending prices sky-high,
literally... literally!...

00:14.499 --> 00:17.578
taking the grass
from its own roots.

00:17.579 --> 00:19.738
And now you've got
your "ConDem nation"...

00:19.739 --> 00:23.498
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up!

00:23.499 --> 00:25.938
Have we had a national
fucking stroke,

00:25.939 --> 00:26.978
or what?

00:26.979 --> 00:30.858
Is revolution a word,
or was it never?

00:30.859 --> 00:33.378
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:33.379 --> 00:36.818
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:36.819 --> 00:40.138
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester,

00:40.139 --> 00:42.898
and they charge us for water!

00:42.899 --> 00:46.898
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:47.699 --> 00:50.938
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times...

00:50.939 --> 00:54.018
Yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak!

00:54.019 --> 00:57.298
It's not theirs any more.

00:57.299 --> 00:59.778
This is our England now!

00:59.779 --> 01:03.778
Paaaarty!

'There was a lad in our school,
called Deano.

'Hard little bastard, from a
long line of hard little bastards.

we were told he'd been knocked over

Hello?

03:06.814 --> 03:09.573
Patty?

03:09.574 --> 03:11.613
What the fuck are you doing?

03:11.614 --> 03:15.613
What the fuck are YOU doing?

03:16.334 --> 03:18.653
Ask what?

03:18.654 --> 03:20.453
I don't like this.

03:20.454 --> 03:24.013
That's not a question... try again.

03:24.014 --> 03:26.333
I don't want this... why am I here?

03:26.334 --> 03:28.773
I've already given your answer.

03:28.774 --> 03:30.653
No, you haven't.

03:30.654 --> 03:34.653
What the fuck are you doing?

03:39.414 --> 03:40.214
Fuck!

03:45.894 --> 03:47.453
I work here!

03:47.454 --> 03:48.573
No, you don't!

03:48.574 --> 03:51.693
I think you'll find I do...
what's left of it.

03:51.694 --> 03:53.053
Oh, fuck!

03:53.054 --> 03:56.013
All right, Cuz...
good to see you back on your feet.

03:56.014 --> 03:59.453
Where am I supposed to live?
Where's Uzma?

03:59.454 --> 04:01.493
Glasgow. Sends her love.

04:01.494 --> 04:03.333
Everything's gonna be all right.

04:03.334 --> 04:07.333
We're decorating the spare room
at Granddad's for you...
got a little job lined up, too.

04:07.494 --> 04:10.573
All that time I was in hospital,
you've been planning this...

04:10.574 --> 04:13.333
no wonder I didn't get
any fucking visitors!

04:13.334 --> 04:15.733
Sorry, mate...
I was gonna drop in tonight.

04:15.734 --> 04:16.572
Been mad busy getting
this place on the market.

04:16.574 --> 04:18.733
Doesn't Granddad usually
take care of that?

04:18.733 --> 04:22.213
He's in Pakistan.

04:26.934 --> 04:30.733
Hiya, Granddad. How was the wedding?

04:30.734 --> 04:33.053
Oh, lovely, that.

04:33.054 --> 04:36.173
Try not to think of this
as something ending...

04:36.174 --> 04:40.173
think of it as something
just about to begin!

04:45.014 --> 04:49.013
If I were shipwrecked on a
desert island with him, I would.

04:50.854 --> 04:54.853
Well, I think he's nice for his age...
he's a good-looking man.

04:54.854 --> 04:56.813
He's a good-looking ex-priest.

04:56.814 --> 05:00.573
He'd smell of incense and communion
wine... the guilt'd dry me up.

05:00.574 --> 05:04.293
What do you think, Karen? Dom.

05:04.294 --> 05:08.293
Only one man for me... he's the
best-looking man on the Chatsworth.

05:08.454 --> 05:09.533
What d'you think, G?

05:09.534 --> 05:13.413
He's too pretty for my taste.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.813
He's embarrassed!

05:14.814 --> 05:18.813
Eh, that's a sight I've never
seen before, Mr Maguire!

05:19.374 --> 05:20.933
Go 'ed, son!

05:20.934 --> 05:24.933
White wine?

05:26.054 --> 05:27.893
Mad busy.

05:27.894 --> 05:30.613
I've had to service a couple meself.

05:30.614 --> 05:32.853
The kid with the granny fixation,

05:32.854 --> 05:34.693
the bloke with the runny eyes
and the labrador.

05:34.694 --> 05:37.253
What was it you wanted
to see me about?

05:37.254 --> 05:39.653
I need you to come back, Kel,
we're run off us feet.

05:39.654 --> 05:41.933
Business doing well, then?

05:41.934 --> 05:45.613
Yeah, but the hours go against
the European Work/Time Directive.

05:45.614 --> 05:47.973
We still need help.

05:47.974 --> 05:50.213
We need some new recruits!

05:50.214 --> 05:53.133
You can't advertise for 'em
in the evening news...

05:53.134 --> 05:55.253
you'll be arrested!
It's soliciting!

05:55.254 --> 05:56.453
Says "massage services".

05:56.454 --> 06:00.453
"Back-door experience essential,
girl-on-girl required as and when."

06:02.654 --> 06:05.373
We need staff and we need 'em now.

06:05.374 --> 06:07.333
The girls haven't even
been for a wax.

06:07.334 --> 06:11.333
Their fannies are like welcome mats!

06:15.294 --> 06:17.573
Hey... welcome back to
the land of the living, Ches!

06:19.974 --> 06:20.773
On the house!

06:21.934 --> 06:23.973
Just Chesney!

06:25.534 --> 06:28.093
Must've terrified
the life out of you.

06:28.094 --> 06:30.093
Bit of a wake-up call, yeah.

06:30.094 --> 06:32.973
Have to pay out now...
I was doing a book on you.

06:32.974 --> 06:36.493
Jonesy won the lot...
over a hundred quid, as well.

06:36.494 --> 06:37.213
How come?

06:37.214 --> 06:39.653
He was the only one
that thought you'd make it.

06:39.654 --> 06:41.453
Top man, Ches, top man.

06:41.454 --> 06:44.373
Rest of us thought you were
coming home in a box.

06:44.374 --> 06:46.653
Take no notice... his mouth's
wired directly to his arse.

06:46.654 --> 06:49.933
We've been worried about you... run
off our feet with the new business,

06:49.934 --> 06:51.173
or we'd've dropped by the hozzy.

06:51.174 --> 06:54.573
We did call, but cos we weren't
related, wouldn't tell us much.

06:54.574 --> 06:58.093
We miss the shop, Ches,
so we're having to do it online now.

06:58.094 --> 07:01.893
Dom pointed out we were all
paying £5 to have food delivered
to each of our houses.

07:01.894 --> 07:05.853
So now we put in one massive order,
delivered to here...

07:05.854 --> 07:08.213
entire drop for a fiver!

07:08.214 --> 07:11.413
You wanna see the points
we collected on the loyalty card!

07:11.414 --> 07:15.253
Loads of messing, though.
Sooner be shopping at yours, Ches.

07:15.254 --> 07:16.413
So when are you opening back up?

07:16.414 --> 07:19.413
I'm just the Paki in the cornershop
to you lot, aren't I?

07:19.414 --> 07:23.413
Don't be daft.
You're hardly even in the shop!

07:28.854 --> 07:30.613
I was wondering
when I'd get you on your own.

07:30.614 --> 07:32.053
Sorry?

07:32.054 --> 07:33.893
Let me finish up,
I'll walk you home.

07:33.894 --> 07:35.653
There's no need.

07:35.654 --> 07:37.253
Give us a chance to talk...

07:37.254 --> 07:40.133
Jamie. Seriously.

07:40.134 --> 07:43.653
Gloria?

07:43.654 --> 07:45.173
C'mon then.

07:45.174 --> 07:49.173
Your carriage awaits.

08:06.294 --> 08:08.093
You selling up?

08:08.094 --> 08:10.773
Granddad.

08:10.774 --> 08:14.773
Yeah. Not like he had
much choice, in my humble.

08:23.934 --> 08:27.493
Come 'ere. You hear that?

08:27.494 --> 08:30.293
A monster approaching.

08:30.294 --> 08:32.253
A supermarket...

08:32.254 --> 08:36.253
dropping its offspring in
every postcode in the country.

08:37.094 --> 08:40.613
Soon, you'll be standing
in its shadow.

08:40.614 --> 08:43.092
Too big for you to fight.

08:43.094 --> 08:46.693
And, having stuffed cash in the
back pocket of every councillor

08:46.694 --> 08:50.693
up and down the land, too
well-connected for you to challenge.

08:51.654 --> 08:55.013
And it'll raise its big
monster foot, bring it down,

08:55.014 --> 08:59.013
and you and your shop will be gone.

08:59.774 --> 09:02.653
Just a memory.

09:02.654 --> 09:05.213
I remember when my dad
first bought this place.

09:05.214 --> 09:09.213
Hey, you're not facing
a firing squad! War's over.

09:10.734 --> 09:11.973
Walk.

09:11.974 --> 09:15.693
You're free!

09:15.694 --> 09:19.493
Yeah. I am.

09:19.494 --> 09:23.253
Thanks, Frank!

09:23.254 --> 09:25.773
Ches!

09:25.774 --> 09:27.253
Give us a hand.

09:27.254 --> 09:29.056
Knees fuse after a while.

09:48.027 --> 09:50.626
Got viewings organised today, mate.

09:50.627 --> 09:53.306
Won't make too good an impression
with your undies

09:53.307 --> 09:55.146
and jizz mags all over the place.

09:55.147 --> 09:57.026
It's personal stuff!

09:57.027 --> 09:59.866
Removal van's booked.
Need this place empty by Thursday.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.506
Gas and leccy'll be cut off
a week Friday.

10:02.507 --> 10:04.426
Asked them to forward
me the bills at base.

10:04.427 --> 10:05.706
Base?

10:05.707 --> 10:09.706
Grandad's. Bradford?

10:10.107 --> 10:14.106
Box what you want,
bin what you don't.

10:14.147 --> 10:16.626
Nice little shop lined
up for you in Bradford.

10:16.627 --> 10:20.106
Loads of old people,
not too much stress.

10:20.107 --> 10:23.786
Keep your head down and you'll
reap the rewards...

10:23.787 --> 10:25.866
Wah! Ya! Ya! Ya!

10:25.867 --> 10:29.586
Ahhh!

10:29.587 --> 10:33.586
And in a few years time,
if you play your cards right...

10:35.747 --> 10:39.746
So... I'll tell Grandad
you're on your way.

10:40.747 --> 10:43.306
No.

10:43.307 --> 10:47.306
Tell him thanks but no thanks.

10:55.267 --> 10:59.266
Thank you very much, Father.
Bless you too.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.866
The Community centre's all yours.

11:02.867 --> 11:06.866
Not being funny, but why are
you auditioning hookers?

11:07.147 --> 11:08.466
To see if they're right for the job.

11:08.467 --> 11:12.466
And surely possessing a fanny
makes them right for the job?

11:12.707 --> 11:14.346
There's a bit more to it than that.

11:14.347 --> 11:16.426
We all know how easy
it is to get a man off.

11:16.427 --> 11:20.426
What you have to ensure, Ruby,
is that you not only get him off

11:21.107 --> 11:23.506
but that you get him back.
Time after time.

11:23.507 --> 11:26.066
Some sort of brand loyalty?

11:26.067 --> 11:29.866
More often than not, you're giving
a man what he doesn't get at home

11:29.867 --> 11:32.146
and that can be a combination
of a million things.

11:32.147 --> 11:33.666
Don't try and pass off what you do

11:33.667 --> 11:35.746
as some sort of psychological
balancing act...

11:35.747 --> 11:39.066
you fuck for money.

11:39.067 --> 11:40.786
He might crave intimacy.

11:40.787 --> 11:41.826
Give it.

11:41.827 --> 11:44.666
A straightforward, selfish fuck.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.026
Give it.

11:46.027 --> 11:47.426
To talk?

11:47.427 --> 11:48.826
Let him.

11:48.827 --> 11:52.546
He might want you to tell him
he's the best you've ever had

11:52.547 --> 11:54.626
and you've been repulsed
by everything he's done.

11:54.627 --> 11:57.826
Get them in, get their money,
get them out.

11:57.827 --> 11:59.506
It's all about profit.

11:59.507 --> 12:00.786
It's all about the moulah.

12:00.787 --> 12:02.386
And not much else.

12:02.387 --> 12:05.306
It's not exactly
skilled labour, is it?

12:05.307 --> 12:06.786
Says the voice of experience.

12:06.787 --> 12:09.546
You don't need to be
in your line of work

12:09.547 --> 12:11.586
to know what a man's looking for.

12:11.587 --> 12:15.586
Market research, see who really
knows her arse from her elbow.

12:19.147 --> 12:22.586
Yeah, all right, you're on.

12:22.587 --> 12:25.106
I was having a discussion
with a friend...

12:25.107 --> 12:27.706
Well, I say "discussion",
I mean argument...

12:27.707 --> 12:31.546
and I say "friend", actually she's
just some slapper that I know

12:31.547 --> 12:33.026
but we were just wondering...

12:33.027 --> 12:35.786
exactly what it was men
looked for in a woman..

12:36.347 --> 12:40.346
Experience tells me
men crave tenderness!

12:40.907 --> 12:43.626
A little bit of affection.

12:43.627 --> 12:45.546
After a good spanking.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.466
Obviously.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.226
'A man knows exactly
what he's after...'

12:49.227 --> 12:52.306
and it ain't chitchat... he can
get that from his ma.

12:52.307 --> 12:53.426
If she wasn't dead.

12:53.427 --> 12:56.546
You see, I think all men
like a spot of courting.

12:56.547 --> 13:00.466
A bit of getting to know you, nice
bit of talk, just to melt the ice...

13:00.467 --> 13:04.386
Men are ruled directly
by their baser instincts.

13:04.387 --> 13:07.786
Evolution's taught them
you get in quick, you drop your DNA

13:07.787 --> 13:10.906
and get off to the next egg
to be fertilised ASAP.

13:10.907 --> 13:12.266
It's a bit of a cliche, isn't it?

13:12.267 --> 13:14.466
Well, cliches are rooted in truth.

13:14.467 --> 13:16.866
Well, does that truth apply
to the Madonna-whore argument?

13:16.867 --> 13:19.466
No, because that
is a bit simplistic.

13:19.467 --> 13:20.786
That's just obvious.

13:20.787 --> 13:22.946
What do you reckon, Mimi?

13:22.947 --> 13:25.266
Are all women mothers
or scrubbers?

13:25.267 --> 13:29.266
I like to think I'm a bit of both!

13:32.267 --> 13:34.146
I can get a ton-20 online.

13:34.147 --> 13:37.026
Then go online.

13:37.027 --> 13:39.746
All right, 30 it is. Class traitor.

13:39.747 --> 13:41.186
Capitalising on the misery of folk

13:41.187 --> 13:43.746
forced to sell their possessions
to make ends meet.

13:43.747 --> 13:45.986
Stop nicking my stuff!

13:45.987 --> 13:49.946
Get off!

13:49.947 --> 13:50.466
Is me SIM in?

13:50.467 --> 13:53.626
The fuck's a SIM?

13:53.627 --> 13:57.186
Oh, you're never getting rid
of poor old Larry, are you?

13:57.187 --> 13:59.506
Colin, how many more times?

13:59.507 --> 14:01.946
We can't take livestock.

14:01.947 --> 14:05.826
We simply don't have the facilities.

14:05.827 --> 14:09.826
Oh! Sorry, Larry.

14:22.547 --> 14:25.146
Just a little list of things
I wanted to do, not mad things,

14:25.147 --> 14:27.106
little dreams I had
when I was a kid.

14:27.107 --> 14:29.106
I've always dreamed
of having a threesome.

14:29.107 --> 14:30.146
Been there.

14:30.147 --> 14:31.386
Done that.

14:31.387 --> 14:34.746
Twosomes, threesomes,
young women, old women...

14:34.747 --> 14:35.186
Mum and daughter...

14:35.187 --> 14:36.226
Mile high...

14:36.227 --> 14:37.266
Pissed up, drugged up, fucked up...

14:37.267 --> 14:38.546
Tied up, indoor, outdoor...

14:38.547 --> 14:40.426
Front door, back door...

14:40.427 --> 14:43.626
Oh, back door!

14:43.627 --> 14:46.746
Eh, I can help you with that
one easy enough.

14:46.747 --> 14:47.866
And I could cover that one, mate.

14:47.867 --> 14:48.906
Yeah?

14:48.907 --> 14:50.906
Ches, you're up!

14:50.907 --> 14:52.146
Singing?!

14:52.147 --> 14:56.146
First time for everything, mate.

14:56.187 --> 15:00.186
I've gotta see this!

15:01.187 --> 15:02.666
One, two, three, ugh!

15:02.667 --> 15:05.906
♪ My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so

15:05.907 --> 15:09.906
♪ And this I know for suuuure

15:09.907 --> 15:10.946
Ugh!

15:10.947 --> 15:14.786
♪ But does she really want to
But can't stand to see me

15:14.787 --> 15:18.786
♪ Walk out the dooor

15:19.067 --> 15:21.146
♪ Don't try to fight the feelin'

15:21.147 --> 15:24.986
♪ Cos the thought alone
Is killing me right nooow... ♪

15:24.987 --> 15:26.266
Sing with me now!

15:28.787 --> 15:30.746
Yeah!

15:30.747 --> 15:33.026
Top of the world!

15:33.027 --> 15:37.026
Stick your helmet on,
you mad bastard!

15:41.787 --> 15:45.786
Oi! What the fuck are you doing?!

16:01.587 --> 16:05.586
Ah!

16:21.347 --> 16:24.986
♪ Hey yaaaa. ♪

16:28.707 --> 16:30.946
I did not know you had
that in you, mate!

16:30.947 --> 16:31.986
Neither did I!

16:31.987 --> 16:34.946
Got me thinking about stuff
I'd like to do as well.

16:34.947 --> 16:36.106
Go on.

16:36.107 --> 16:39.346
Well, like swimming with dolphins.
That'd be cool, wouldn't it?

16:39.347 --> 16:41.186
Or jump out of a plane.

16:41.187 --> 16:42.226
That could be arranged.

16:42.227 --> 16:43.986
I think he means with a parachute.

16:43.987 --> 16:46.146
We're talking dreams, aren't we?

16:46.147 --> 16:48.666
Things you'd like to do if other
things in our way.

16:48.667 --> 16:52.666
Exactly! Like getting a bit
of back door action off Mimi.

16:52.707 --> 16:53.826
Same again, lads?

16:53.827 --> 16:55.506
Yes, mate.

16:55.507 --> 16:59.506
Can I just have... ugh! Ah!

16:59.987 --> 17:02.146
Shit!

17:02.147 --> 17:03.466
Me purse has gone.

17:03.467 --> 17:04.826
You're kidding?

17:04.827 --> 17:08.106
My purse has gone!

17:08.107 --> 17:10.346
Is there a tealeaf in here?!

17:10.347 --> 17:11.986
Yeah.

17:11.987 --> 17:15.986
You know what I mean,
you gang of smart arses!

17:17.107 --> 17:19.786
Fuck!

17:19.787 --> 17:21.346
Good day?

17:21.347 --> 17:23.346
Fucking blinding, as it goes.

17:23.347 --> 17:25.665
Think I've got, maybe,
half a dozen people

17:25.666 --> 17:28.425
that take their pleasure serious.

17:28.426 --> 17:30.866
Yeah, spoke to a few myself...

17:30.867 --> 17:33.466
you know, the young and limber ones?

17:33.467 --> 17:35.866
I have clients I've known 10 years.

17:35.867 --> 17:38.066
I wasn't even in high school
10 years ago.

17:38.067 --> 17:42.066
Bet you still gave
a good blow-job, though.

17:57.547 --> 18:01.546
You are joking, Jamie?

18:01.747 --> 18:03.986
Drinks are on me next time I'm in.

18:03.987 --> 18:06.266
I owe you an apology.

18:06.267 --> 18:08.826
For not calling.

18:08.827 --> 18:12.826
If your application's successful,
I'll supply the condoms and lube.

18:14.187 --> 18:17.026
'Then all you do is lie back
and think of Lytham St Annes.'

18:17.027 --> 18:21.026
Look... it was just a fuck,
nothing more and nothing less.

18:27.667 --> 18:28.746
It's Dom.

20:04.907 --> 20:07.386
See, I'm not bothered
about a job just yet.

20:07.387 --> 20:10.986
I want to enjoy myself for a bit.

20:10.987 --> 20:13.266
What's that?

20:13.267 --> 20:15.586
Oh, please, don't Karen.

20:15.587 --> 20:19.506
Where did you get the photo?
It's ancient.

20:19.507 --> 20:22.506
Lip gave it me. Years back.

20:22.507 --> 20:26.066
Who for? Me... or Wendy?

20:26.067 --> 20:28.546
Both. Look, I was 12.

20:28.547 --> 20:31.866
God, I was young.

20:31.867 --> 20:34.826
Can I borrow this?

20:34.827 --> 20:37.066
Me and Carl used to say we'd
ask the both of you out.

20:37.067 --> 20:39.666
Cinema, pizza...

20:39.667 --> 20:40.546
Hey, Wendy'd still be up for that.
I'll give her a bell.

20:40.547 --> 20:44.546
No!

20:44.827 --> 20:48.066
Fuck it! Yeah, yeah. Call her.

20:48.067 --> 20:49.706
That'd be brilliant.

20:49.707 --> 20:53.706
What you stuck this in with, Ches?

20:59.947 --> 21:02.106
What you doing having
a shower at this time?

21:02.107 --> 21:03.426
Spilt a load of ale over
myself in the cellar.

21:03.427 --> 21:05.226
I'll put your clothes in the wash.

21:05.227 --> 21:06.506
I've done it.

21:06.507 --> 21:10.066
Getting very domesticated
in your old age.

21:10.067 --> 21:13.386
Yeah well, I'm in my prime, me.

21:13.387 --> 21:16.786
Thinking about getting my haircut.
What do you reckon?

21:16.787 --> 21:19.906
D'you approve?

21:19.907 --> 21:21.706
Yeah, blonde's good.

21:21.707 --> 21:25.706
Hmm.

21:30.507 --> 21:31.917
I'll take that as a "yes".

21:48.564 --> 21:49.603
Hey!

21:49.604 --> 21:50.643
Hey!

21:51.196 --> 21:52.075
Nice, Ches. What's that?

21:52.110 --> 21:54.549
I'm sensing
there's a woman involved.

21:54.550 --> 21:55.909
Not just a woman.

21:55.910 --> 21:57.189
Woman of his dreams.

21:57.190 --> 21:58.269
Wet dreams!

21:59.410 --> 22:00.729
A girl I had a crush on, years back.

22:00.730 --> 22:03.009
Been carrying
a bit of a torch for her.

22:03.025 --> 22:06.544
Well, she's agreed to accompany me
on a date. Wine, dine...

22:06.545 --> 22:08.264
69!

22:08.377 --> 22:12.376
Nah, I want to do this properly.
Nice meal...

22:12.577 --> 22:14.136
Candlelight, bit of a chat.

22:14.137 --> 22:17.536
Exactly. Last time we
seen each other we were kids.

22:17.537 --> 22:20.056
Now you're all grown up.

22:20.057 --> 22:24.056
Quick one before she turns up, Ches?

22:27.017 --> 22:29.456
Bit of fluff there...

22:29.457 --> 22:31.736
Cheers, mate.

22:31.737 --> 22:33.016
So...

22:33.017 --> 22:35.456
Hope she's worth all this effort.

22:35.457 --> 22:38.136
Yeah, man, she's lovely.

22:38.137 --> 22:40.216
I just can't believe she said yes!

22:40.217 --> 22:42.056
That why you're so nervous, eh?

22:42.057 --> 22:45.416
It's a big deal.
Just want to get it right.

22:45.417 --> 22:47.816
Course you do.

22:47.817 --> 22:49.336
I've waited years for this.

22:49.337 --> 22:53.336
All my fuckin' life.

22:54.097 --> 22:58.096
Aye, aye.

23:13.737 --> 23:17.736
Father Craig
said they were waiting in here.

23:23.257 --> 23:26.536
Bloody hell!

23:26.537 --> 23:30.096
I knew jobs were thin on the ground
but this is ridiculous!

23:30.097 --> 23:32.016
You sure
everyone's in the right room?

23:32.017 --> 23:35.536
Can I just ask, is everyone here
to see Lillian Tyler?

23:35.537 --> 23:37.976
Is that for the auditions
for the whoring?

23:37.977 --> 23:40.336
Don't knock it
if you haven't tried it!

23:40.337 --> 23:42.016
Big market for GILFs.

23:42.267 --> 23:43.386
You'll be old one day.

23:43.387 --> 23:46.386
Let's get down to business.

23:46.387 --> 23:49.786
Can everyone under 25
go to the right, please?

23:49.787 --> 23:52.586
Everybody over 25 to your left.

23:52.587 --> 23:56.586
Bus passes, Zimmers
and arthritics to the back.

24:08.067 --> 24:11.666
Hi, mate.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.586
Look, I don't know
what's going on here, but...

24:13.587 --> 24:14.706
Nothing's going on.

24:14.707 --> 24:18.066
We can't do this, it was a mistake.

24:18.067 --> 24:19.666
That happened twice.

24:19.667 --> 24:23.146
That won't happen again.

24:23.147 --> 24:27.146
Do you know what, Gloria?
I'm not that fuckin' desperate.

24:27.747 --> 24:30.826
'Not even a ham shank
on the way home?'

24:30.827 --> 24:34.826
Wasn't about that.
This was about romance. Right, Ches?

24:39.307 --> 24:41.746
You know how to do things properly,
Ches.

24:41.747 --> 24:43.866
You've grown up
into a lovely little gent.

24:43.867 --> 24:46.586
It was about getting
to know each other.

24:46.587 --> 24:49.826
Seeing if you've got more in common
than physical attraction.

24:49.827 --> 24:50.866
Small talk.

24:50.867 --> 24:54.866
That one should never have been
allowed within ten feet of a school!

24:54.987 --> 24:56.866
He were a fuckin' letch.

24:56.867 --> 25:00.866
Knicker sniffer!

25:00.947 --> 25:04.746
So you forked out for a three-course
meal, wine, and a cab?

25:04.747 --> 25:07.266
If I'd laid that amount of cash out,

25:07.267 --> 25:08.786
I'd want something in return.

25:08.787 --> 25:10.826
Wasn't really that kind of night.

25:10.827 --> 25:13.906
You're the fittest guy
I've been with all month!

25:13.907 --> 25:16.706
Month?!

25:16.707 --> 25:18.146
We need to get you home.

25:18.147 --> 25:20.146
No! Me dad's in, we can't.

25:20.147 --> 25:24.146
It's OK, here'll do.

25:30.827 --> 25:34.706
Must have been a dodgy prawn.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.746
Know what?

25:36.747 --> 25:39.586
I dreamt of being with that girl
so many times.

25:39.587 --> 25:41.986
It could never live up
to your expectations.

25:41.987 --> 25:43.826
Happens to us all.

25:43.827 --> 25:46.026
Bad timing.

25:46.027 --> 25:49.186
Thought I'd find you here
with your drinking cronies.

25:49.187 --> 25:51.306
You left that in the shop.

25:51.307 --> 25:55.306
It looked important.

25:59.707 --> 26:03.386
I'm done with this.

26:03.387 --> 26:04.866
Same again, chaps?

26:04.867 --> 26:08.866
Yeah.

26:31.827 --> 26:33.386
Fuck me!

26:33.387 --> 26:37.186
I won't fuck you
if it's all the same.

26:37.187 --> 26:39.506
I haven't got a question.

26:39.507 --> 26:41.426
No, but I have.

26:41.427 --> 26:44.666
What kind of man
are you going to be?

26:44.667 --> 26:48.666
One who squeaks, or one who roars?

26:55.267 --> 26:59.266
Hiya.

27:15.187 --> 27:17.746
Well, it was certainly entertaining.

27:17.747 --> 27:20.346
Can you tell me a bit
about yourself, sweetheart?

27:20.347 --> 27:23.346
Well, I'm a community policeman
during the day.

27:23.347 --> 27:25.906
Trying to earn a few extra bob
at night, really.

27:25.907 --> 27:27.306
It'd be great for the locals

27:27.307 --> 27:30.226
but would it appeal
to the international market?

27:30.227 --> 27:34.226
Have you got anything else
that you can show us?

27:46.427 --> 27:49.106
Looks nice, Karen.

27:49.107 --> 27:50.346
Don't you think, Jamie?

27:50.347 --> 27:51.506
Yeah, lovely.

27:51.507 --> 27:55.506
You haven't even looked.

27:56.987 --> 28:00.266
Why didn't you tell her
she looked lovely, soft lad?

28:00.267 --> 28:01.626
Cos I'd be lying.

28:01.627 --> 28:04.746
Well, if you can't lie to your wife,
who can you lie to?

28:04.747 --> 28:08.746
Flowers. One fuck-off bunch
of roses, and a big fat apology.

28:09.627 --> 28:13.626
Heartless bastard!

28:17.627 --> 28:21.626
The living accommodation will give
a good return on your investment.

28:22.067 --> 28:25.266
And there's masses
of potential for the shop.

28:25.267 --> 28:29.266
I'm thinking wall-to-wall sunbeds,
maybe a spray tan machine.

28:29.747 --> 28:33.746
Plenty round here in need of a tan
and not just the fellas!

28:39.547 --> 28:42.386
Not a clue.

28:42.387 --> 28:45.066
Unlike you.

28:45.067 --> 28:47.706
People just need a little shop
selling basics.

28:47.707 --> 28:48.946
Stuff you've run out of.

28:48.947 --> 28:50.266
Essentials.

28:50.267 --> 28:52.266
And who needs more than that?

28:52.267 --> 28:55.666
Life's too short.

28:55.667 --> 28:58.746
Exactly.

28:58.747 --> 29:00.506
I look like I've been hang-gliding.

29:00.507 --> 29:03.386
Seriously, Karen,
you need to go back to the salon.

29:03.387 --> 29:07.106
Especially what they charged you,
they should put it right.

29:07.107 --> 29:09.426
I didn't pay 'em. I refused to.

29:09.427 --> 29:12.346
Tried to force me. I said my fella
would torch the place

29:12.347 --> 29:14.626
if they gave me any more hassle.

29:14.627 --> 29:15.706
Is that what he said?

29:15.707 --> 29:16.746
He's not bothered.

29:16.747 --> 29:20.186
Mardy-arsed bastard's got his
Calvins in a twist for some reason.

29:21.627 --> 29:23.226
I'll get it.

29:23.227 --> 29:26.146
Oh, God, I don't want him
to see me like this!

29:26.147 --> 29:29.066
I don't want anybody
to see me like this!

29:29.067 --> 29:33.066
Please, G. Can't you get me back
to some sort of normality?

29:34.547 --> 29:36.026
Thank you.

29:36.027 --> 29:39.786
Gloria... These are for you.

29:39.787 --> 29:43.786
New fella? Never said.

29:44.427 --> 29:45.946
Nothing special.

29:45.947 --> 29:49.546
You've obviously made an impression.

29:49.547 --> 29:52.346
Cheers.

29:52.347 --> 29:54.466
Him upstairs has given you
a second chance

29:54.467 --> 29:55.986
and what are you doing with it?

29:55.987 --> 29:58.866
Propping up the bar with someone
old enough to be your dad.

29:58.867 --> 30:00.146
Oh, thanks, Mimi!

30:00.147 --> 30:03.026
I'm not knocking it.
If you're going to go, go happy,

30:03.027 --> 30:04.346
that's what I'm saying!

30:04.347 --> 30:06.506
I am going to do something, Mimi.

30:06.507 --> 30:10.186
The plans I've heard from fellas
sat where you are, Ches...

30:10.187 --> 30:11.986
going to conquer the world!

30:11.987 --> 30:15.986
Not one of them even got as far
as the end of the M62!

30:17.667 --> 30:18.906
Who's paying?

30:18.907 --> 30:22.906
Here, I'll get this.

30:23.627 --> 30:24.826
There we go. Ta.

30:24.827 --> 30:26.706
I need to...

30:26.707 --> 30:30.706
I need to go,
I've got to do something.

30:33.947 --> 30:36.506
Stunning! Absolutely stunning!

30:36.507 --> 30:37.986
Give us a twirl!

30:37.987 --> 30:39.066
Looks good.

30:39.067 --> 30:40.546
Beautiful.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.186
Yeah, thanks to Gloria.

30:42.187 --> 30:44.066
Now that's what I call an apology.

30:44.067 --> 30:46.306
They're off G. Some shag she's had.

30:46.307 --> 30:50.026
Banged him twice and it's red roses
and, "When can I see you again?"

30:50.027 --> 30:54.026
How pathetic are some fellas?

30:54.947 --> 30:57.786
I'll contact the family's solicitors
and get the contracts drawn up.

30:57.787 --> 31:00.346
Forget your tanning shop idea,
won't work.

31:00.347 --> 31:02.746
No-one's got the cash for sunbeds.

31:02.747 --> 31:04.826
Only reason
he's telling you otherwise

31:04.827 --> 31:07.266
is to get shot of this place
and back to Bradford.

31:07.987 --> 31:09.506
What's it to you?

31:09.507 --> 31:13.506
You're getting this all wrong, Ches.
It's not about us and you!

31:14.227 --> 31:16.386
That's how it's coming over, Toof!

31:16.387 --> 31:19.026
I want you to come home with me.

31:19.027 --> 31:23.026
I need you to see something.

31:27.387 --> 31:28.746
First place we had...

31:28.747 --> 31:30.826
flat over a chippy.

31:30.827 --> 31:34.826
Stunk of fish and grease,
know what I mean?

31:36.667 --> 31:40.466
Then one day, Grandad picks us up
from the shop, brings us here,

31:40.467 --> 31:43.466
hands us the keys.

31:43.467 --> 31:46.186
He were that pleased
with the graft we'd put in,

31:46.187 --> 31:50.186
rewarded us with this.

31:50.267 --> 31:52.506
I know he can be a pain in the arse.

31:52.507 --> 31:55.306
Work him to your advantage, Ches.

31:55.307 --> 31:57.586
I dream of somewhere like this.

31:57.587 --> 32:01.586
Could be yours.

32:01.867 --> 32:03.986
That's the point, really, Toof...

32:03.987 --> 32:06.106
it couldn't.

32:06.107 --> 32:08.186
Just like it'll never be yours.

32:08.187 --> 32:09.226
Step out of line,

32:09.227 --> 32:10.746
you'll be back in the flat over
the chippy in no time.

32:10.747 --> 32:11.826
No.

32:11.827 --> 32:14.426
I saw how he treated Dad
when he wasn't doing as he was told.

32:14.427 --> 32:16.306
There's always going to be a boss,

32:16.307 --> 32:19.546
always someone telling you
what to do and how to do it.

32:19.547 --> 32:21.106
Not for me there isn't.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.666
I'm going to buy the shop.

32:23.667 --> 32:25.266
You can't do it on your own!

32:25.267 --> 32:29.266
No?

32:29.267 --> 32:31.539
Well, I'll die trying.

33:04.836 --> 33:08.835
Go on, fuck off!

33:18.205 --> 33:21.364
'Please leave your
message after the tone.'

33:21.365 --> 33:24.284
It's me. I need to see you.

33:24.285 --> 33:27.124
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend.

33:27.125 --> 33:31.124
This sort of thing... It's not
my usual bag, it's confusing.

33:34.285 --> 33:36.564
Just... call me.

33:36.565 --> 33:40.444
Please.

33:40.445 --> 33:42.284
What the fuck are you looking at?

33:42.285 --> 33:46.284
Oh! Oh.

33:54.485 --> 33:58.484
Miaow.

34:01.885 --> 34:04.484
I'll tell you something odd,
and this will sound weird,

34:04.485 --> 34:07.004
but I had this dream last night,
and you came in here

34:07.005 --> 34:09.083
and played out this dream.

34:09.085 --> 34:11.643
It's unbelievable.
It's totally unbelievable.

34:11.645 --> 34:12.964
Fuck!

34:12.965 --> 34:14.284
We want to live that dream.

34:14.284 --> 34:16.244
We're doing this for us family.

34:16.245 --> 34:20.244
We want to give them a better life,
a decent home, a future.

34:21.284 --> 34:25.284
We've got four kids. We're saving
for college fees for the brightest.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.603
It's a speciality act,
and a good one.

34:27.605 --> 34:29.804
I see a bright future for you two.

34:29.804 --> 34:33.284
Fuck! Where's the art, eh?

34:33.284 --> 34:35.724
Where's the originality?

34:35.725 --> 34:38.563
Says she who thinks "legs akimbo?
Is in the Kama Sutra.

34:38.565 --> 34:40.123
This is my game, kid.

34:40.125 --> 34:44.123
You might've had a few knee tremblers
along the way... but I am an artiste!

34:45.005 --> 34:47.123
You are stuck in your ways,
been at it too long.

34:47.125 --> 34:48.844
You've not been at it long enough.

34:48.844 --> 34:52.563
You know what?
You've past your sell-by date, love.

34:59.285 --> 35:01.524
Suits you.

35:01.525 --> 35:05.084
You look lovely.

35:05.085 --> 35:06.564
I'm sorry.

35:06.565 --> 35:09.164
Are you gonna tell me what's up?

35:09.165 --> 35:11.964
I'm just bored.

35:11.965 --> 35:15.284
Of me? Us?

35:15.285 --> 35:18.604
Of this place.

35:18.605 --> 35:22.604
I wake up here, I work here,
eat here, sleep here.

35:24.165 --> 35:26.324
I'll live and fucking die here.

35:26.325 --> 35:30.324
The same four walls'd drive
anyone round the bend.

35:32.485 --> 35:36.484
You are more important
than any of this.

35:40.725 --> 35:44.724
Now, let's get a smile
back on that face.

35:48.125 --> 35:52.124
I love you.

36:02.245 --> 36:06.084
I managed to convince her
to come back.

36:06.085 --> 36:08.404
I miss the funny accent,
if I'm honest.

36:08.405 --> 36:10.084
Fuckin' skin her!

36:10.085 --> 36:12.284
Can we not aim for a bit of decorum?

36:12.285 --> 36:16.284
We've people's futures in us hands.
Hopes, dreams, ambitions.

36:18.765 --> 36:21.244
Decision time.

36:21.245 --> 36:23.004
I think lose "woman with cock".

36:23.005 --> 36:24.684
It's a man with tits.

36:24.685 --> 36:26.844
It's just confusing.

36:26.845 --> 36:29.124
RSPCA'll kick off.

36:29.125 --> 36:30.564
Vacuum man were interesting.

36:30.565 --> 36:33.244
Perfect, if you want a good ramming.

36:33.245 --> 36:35.964
A looker but a bit obvious.

36:35.965 --> 36:39.964
Yeah, when you pay good money,
"obvious" is what you want.

36:41.245 --> 36:42.404
Our final four.

36:42.405 --> 36:44.284
The librarian from Burnley?

36:44.285 --> 36:46.484
This went on a vote, Lillian.

36:46.485 --> 36:49.804
Who told you this were a democracy?
I want him and all.

36:49.805 --> 36:50.964
Why?

36:50.965 --> 36:52.804
Reminds me of little Bobby Davro.

36:52.805 --> 36:56.804
Bobby only has to smile
to get me wet.

37:04.325 --> 37:08.324
You must have savings or money put
aside for you by the family?

37:08.325 --> 37:11.524
Nope! Every penny I've got
went on buying the fittings back.

37:11.525 --> 37:13.724
My fittings, my shop.

37:13.725 --> 37:17.284
All that matters is,
I'm gonna do it.

37:17.285 --> 37:21.284
Well, determination for its own
sake can be very admirable, but...

37:22.045 --> 37:25.524
Like that Japanese guy who kept
fighting World War II till,

37:25.525 --> 37:29.324
like, 1976 or summat.

37:29.325 --> 37:33.324
What?
It finished in... ages before that.

37:39.445 --> 37:42.404
It's my cousin.
Wants to know the plan.

37:42.405 --> 37:43.884
What is the plan?

37:43.885 --> 37:47.644
That failure is not an option.

37:47.645 --> 37:49.004
I could have a word?

37:49.005 --> 37:51.764
I mean, I could have a word with
the family, about money.

37:51.765 --> 37:55.764
Your cousin could come
if he's worried.

37:57.245 --> 37:59.724
You never gave a toss about
the shop in the past,

37:59.725 --> 38:02.604
so why would we believe that you
do now?

38:02.605 --> 38:04.364
Things are different now.

38:04.365 --> 38:06.844
I'm different.

38:06.845 --> 38:10.844
What I need, and what I don't,
all different.

38:10.925 --> 38:12.644
We've got a pub to run.

38:12.645 --> 38:15.244
I could get that place
back in profit in three months.

38:15.245 --> 38:17.284
How?

38:17.285 --> 38:20.604
I'll stay open day and night,
work my fingers to the bone.

38:20.605 --> 38:23.364
I won't take a wage
till we're in profit.

38:23.365 --> 38:27.364
You'd have access to the books 24/7,
and if he fucks up...

38:27.605 --> 38:30.324
I won't...fuck up.

38:30.325 --> 38:33.044
All right. One condition.

38:33.045 --> 38:37.044
You call it Paddy's Market...
after my dad.

38:38.525 --> 38:41.724
No. It's my shop.

38:41.725 --> 38:44.684
I'm in there in the bricks
and mortar, and you're not.

38:44.685 --> 38:45.764
Neither is your dad.

38:45.765 --> 38:48.004
Come on. What's in a name?

38:48.005 --> 38:52.004
You're a Maguire. Would you let
anyone take that away?

39:26.405 --> 39:28.164
What the fuck are you doing?

39:28.165 --> 39:30.444
My own little routine, mate.

39:30.445 --> 39:34.444
Oh, shit, yeah, how did it go?

39:34.765 --> 39:36.644
I don't need them.

39:36.645 --> 39:38.204
You're right. Do it on your own.

39:38.205 --> 39:42.204
Mortgage, gas, lecky, council tax,
VAT, no credit.

39:42.565 --> 39:44.844
All that shit'd get a lesser man
down, mate, but not you.

39:44.845 --> 39:47.884
You're a fucking superhero!

39:47.885 --> 39:50.604
Do Asian people have superheroes
or is it just Gods

39:50.605 --> 39:52.484
wi' loads of arms and stuff?

39:52.485 --> 39:55.044
That's Hindu. I'm Muslim. Duhhh!

39:55.045 --> 39:59.044
Fuck off! Hindus are only
in fucking comics and that.

39:59.805 --> 40:03.804
I've got work, mate.

40:05.445 --> 40:08.884
I've never seen one with a bend
like that. Is it 90 degrees?

40:08.885 --> 40:11.404
It varies. Acute and obtuse.

40:11.405 --> 40:15.084
Can fuck round corners.
That's got to be an advantage.

40:15.085 --> 40:17.804
Kelly's right.
No substitute for experience.

40:17.805 --> 40:19.724
Ruby has got a point, though.

40:19.725 --> 40:23.524
Gudrun has got all the enthusiasm
of a beginner.

40:23.525 --> 40:24.924
Amongst other advantages.

40:24.925 --> 40:25.684
Hindenberg.

40:25.685 --> 40:26.764
Bless you.

40:26.765 --> 40:30.324
She does make me laugh, that Ruby.
I can't understand a word she says,

40:30.325 --> 40:32.124
but I just smile and nod.

40:32.125 --> 40:34.404
I thought at least one of them
would be here for induction.

40:34.405 --> 40:36.164
I've sent 'em out.

40:36.165 --> 40:38.164
Medical's my bag.

40:38.165 --> 40:42.164
Speaking of which...
would you bend over?

40:50.765 --> 40:54.764
I have to admit that some of your
young and virile team were...

40:55.085 --> 40:59.084
fucking knock-out.

40:59.365 --> 41:02.524
I can see why punters keep
returning to some of your...

41:02.525 --> 41:06.524
more experienced heads.

41:07.045 --> 41:11.044
Don't poverty make people do
kinky shit?

41:21.925 --> 41:24.324
There's been an offer made
on the shop.

41:24.325 --> 41:27.964
Shit!

41:27.965 --> 41:31.964
A bit of luck, I could've made
something of this place.

41:32.605 --> 41:34.604
I'm sorry.

41:34.605 --> 41:36.924
I'll grab my stuff.

41:36.925 --> 41:40.924
I turned the offer down.

41:41.645 --> 41:44.524
We'll have the deeds transferred
first thing tomorrow.

41:44.525 --> 41:47.404
Grandad'll fuckin' kill you!

41:47.405 --> 41:50.964
Don't let me down, Ches.

41:50.965 --> 41:53.924
I will not let you down!
No way will I let you down!

41:53.925 --> 41:56.364
Thank you so fucking much!

41:56.365 --> 41:58.684
Hey! Love-in?

41:58.685 --> 42:00.324
I'm sorry to interrupt.

42:00.325 --> 42:03.044
So you're gonna try
and make a go of this place?

42:03.045 --> 42:04.084
Yeah.

42:04.085 --> 42:06.924
In that case,
you're gonna need these.

42:06.925 --> 42:08.124
For...?

42:08.125 --> 42:09.164
Them.

42:09.165 --> 42:12.284
We've gone with magnolia.

42:12.285 --> 42:14.244
They only had magnolia.

42:14.245 --> 42:16.084
I like magnolia. I love magnolia!

42:16.085 --> 42:18.924
Could do with a few more rollers
and brushes.

42:18.925 --> 42:21.444
Jamie, go on, some in our loft.

42:21.445 --> 42:25.444
I'll give you a hand.

42:28.445 --> 42:30.644
No need to stand on ceremony.

42:30.645 --> 42:34.644
I've checked on the internet,
and this is all kosher.

42:35.085 --> 42:36.764
That's Jewish, Mimi.

42:36.765 --> 42:38.324
Lamb's Jewish?

42:38.325 --> 42:39.884
Kosher's Jewish.

42:39.885 --> 42:41.124
Then what's lamb?

42:41.125 --> 42:42.244
New Zealand?

42:42.245 --> 42:43.604
Thought they were Welsh.

42:43.605 --> 42:46.364
Look, can I ask
what this is all about?

42:46.365 --> 42:49.604
Never thought I'd say this, Ches,
but you impressed me here, mate.

42:49.605 --> 42:53.044
You showed commitment...
can't buy that.

42:53.045 --> 42:55.484
Fuck knows, we've tried! Turnip?

42:55.485 --> 42:58.444
We wanna help you get back
on your feet, mate.

42:58.445 --> 42:59.924
Go on.

42:59.925 --> 43:02.684
Mam?

43:02.685 --> 43:04.924
We sell dope from your place.

43:04.925 --> 43:08.564
Maybe a bit of coke,
and the money goes through the till.

43:08.565 --> 43:09.604
Laundering?

43:09.605 --> 43:13.604
We stay silent partners.
Take 10% of your profits.

43:13.845 --> 43:16.844
And discount at the till.
A little one.

43:16.845 --> 43:19.004
What's the catch?

43:19.005 --> 43:20.804
There isn't one.

43:20.805 --> 43:22.924
You've no family around here, Ches.

43:22.925 --> 43:26.084
So from now on, you're one of us.

43:26.085 --> 43:27.524
An honorary Maguire.

43:27.525 --> 43:31.524
And that offer's not extended
to many.

43:31.645 --> 43:34.644
So, are you in?

43:34.645 --> 43:36.644
Too fuckin' right!

43:36.645 --> 43:39.604
Welcome to the clan.

43:39.605 --> 43:43.604
Cheers.

43:57.765 --> 44:01.764
I suppose you're pleased
with yourself?

44:02.005 --> 44:03.084
Yeah.

44:03.085 --> 44:05.764
I always knew you had it in you.

44:05.765 --> 44:09.324
No, you didn't. But I did.

44:09.325 --> 44:13.324
That makes no sense.
I'm a figment of your imagination.

44:13.885 --> 44:17.884
I'm after a better quality
of hallucination.

44:22.445 --> 44:25.244
All right?

44:25.245 --> 44:29.244
I'll put a curse on you!

44:37.125 --> 44:40.564
'On reflection, I don't believe
there is a light at the end
of the tunnel.

44:40.565 --> 44:44.484
'No voice telling you to go back.

44:44.485 --> 44:47.044
'Once your number's up, it's up.'

44:53.685 --> 44:56.404
'So take a good look around.

44:56.405 --> 45:00.404
'Like what you see? Great, enjoy.

45:02.045 --> 45:06.044
'But if you don't,
move on and move on now.

45:06.525 --> 45:09.084
'No use settling for second best.

45:09.085 --> 45:12.684
'This ain't no rehearsal.

45:12.685 --> 45:16.684
'This is the real deal.'

45:29.085 --> 45:30.564
Where are you off to?

45:30.565 --> 45:32.044
The less I tell you, the better.

45:32.045 --> 45:32.884
It's a big job.

45:32.885 --> 45:34.404
I want you to know, that's all.

45:34.405 --> 45:36.684
All right, strictly 30 minutes.

45:36.685 --> 45:39.444
We only take what we can carry.
No more than 11 rolls a man.

45:39.445 --> 45:41.804
He didn't come home.
Maybe he's seeing someone.

45:41.805 --> 45:42.884
Stop sticking your tits out.

45:42.885 --> 45:43.924
I'm not.

45:43.925 --> 45:45.164
Manchester's next gift
to the world.

45:45.165 --> 45:46.364
I've got a semi here.

45:46.365 --> 45:47.324
Is that a penis?

45:47.325 --> 45:48.684
Somebody's doctored it.

45:48.685 --> 45:50.404
They're all missing. All of them.

45:50.405 --> 45:53.004
So if he hasn't told you,
then we are fucked.

45:53.005 --> 45:57.004
Oh...!

46:34.085 --> 46:36.324
It's my bike.
I'm the bloke... clearly.

46:36.325 --> 46:39.124
Winslet in front... DiCaprio behind.

46:39.125 --> 46:40.164
I'm the bloke.

46:40.165 --> 46:41.364
Fuck off!
I am the bloke.

46:41.365 --> 46:43.964
How the fuck are you the bloke?!

46:45.445 --> 46:46.484
Hold on, Ches!

46:46.485 --> 46:47.524
Yeah!

46:47.525 --> 46:49.524
I am the bloke!

46:49.525 --> 46:51.322
Fuck off!
I'm the bloke!
