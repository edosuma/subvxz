WEBVTT

00:01.127 --> 00:03.711
You know, I've been thinking
about timetravel again.

00:03.924 --> 00:06.471
Why? Did you hit a roadblock
with invisibility?

00:07.966 --> 00:09.326
Put it on a backburner.

00:10.339 --> 00:11.690
Anyway.
It occurs to me,

00:11.883 --> 00:13.599
If I have ever did
perfect time machine,

00:13.792 --> 00:15.760
I'd just go into the past
and give it to myself.

00:16.030 --> 00:19.329
That's eliminating the need for me
to invent it in the first place.

00:20.151 --> 00:21.173
Interesting.

00:21.364 --> 00:23.583
Yeah, it really kicks the pressure off.

00:24.546 --> 00:25.830
Sounds like a breakthrough.

00:26.003 --> 00:28.338
Should I call Science Magazine
and tell them to hold the cover?

00:28.809 --> 00:30.774
It's time travel,
I will have already done that.

00:32.938 --> 00:34.695
Then I guess congratulations
are in order.

00:35.242 --> 00:37.827
No, congratulations will
have been in order.

00:39.172 --> 00:41.155
You know, I am not going
to enjoy this party.

00:41.310 --> 00:43.120
I know,
I'm familiar with you.

00:43.655 --> 00:46.388
The last department party,
Professor Finkleday cornered me

00:46.542 --> 00:48.819
and talked about
spelunking for 45 minutes.

00:49.015 --> 00:50.078
Yes, I was there.

00:50.233 --> 00:52.100
You know what's interesting
about caves?

00:52.260 --> 00:53.643
- What?
- Nothing.

00:55.737 --> 00:58.080
Then we'll avoid him,
we'll meet the new department head,

00:58.215 --> 00:59.907
congratulate him,
shake his hand and go.

01:00.066 --> 01:02.754
How's this?
"Pleased to meet you, Dr. Gablehauser.

01:03.026 --> 01:04.839
"How fortunate for you
that the university's

01:04.976 --> 01:06.573
"chosen to hire you,
despite the fact

01:06.708 --> 01:08.936
"that you've done no original
research in 25 years,

01:09.071 --> 01:11.118
"and instead have written
a series of popular books

01:11.254 --> 01:12.990
"that reduce
the great concepts of science

01:13.127 --> 01:14.378
"to a series of anecdotes,

01:14.552 --> 01:16.765
"each one dumbed down
to accommodate the duration

01:16.958 --> 01:18.846
"of an average bowel movement.

01:20.283 --> 01:21.283
Mahalo."

01:25.045 --> 01:27.039
"Mahalo's" a nice touch.

01:28.158 --> 01:30.473
You know there only eight consonants
in Hawaiian language?

01:30.608 --> 01:32.711
Interesting.
You should lead with that.

01:35.293 --> 01:37.252
Oh, God, look at this buffet.

01:38.014 --> 01:39.266
I love America.

01:39.761 --> 01:41.191
You don't have buffets in India?

01:41.388 --> 01:43.663
Of course,
but it's all Indian food.

01:44.555 --> 01:47.082
You can't find a bagel
in Mumbai to save your life.

01:47.423 --> 01:48.423
Shmear me.

01:50.843 --> 01:53.602
- Here's an interesting turn of events.
- What?

01:56.484 --> 01:57.680
Howard brought a date?

01:57.808 --> 01:59.345
A more plausible explanation is that

01:59.519 --> 02:00.869
his work in robotics has made

02:01.033 --> 02:02.519
an amazing leap forward.

02:03.459 --> 02:05.509
Hey, what up,
science bitches?

02:07.828 --> 02:08.907
May I introduce my

02:09.062 --> 02:10.644
special lady friend Summer?

02:10.931 --> 02:13.535
- I told you touching's extra.
- Right. Sorry.

02:15.345 --> 02:17.782
Here comes our new boss.
Be polite.

02:18.135 --> 02:20.484
Hi, fellas.
Eric Gablehauser.

02:20.705 --> 02:21.761
Howard Wolowitz.

02:22.649 --> 02:24.191
Nice to meet you.
And you are?

02:25.197 --> 02:27.083
An actual real scientist.

02:30.750 --> 02:31.848
How was that?

02:33.664 --> 02:35.632
I can't believe he fired me.

02:36.497 --> 02:39.081
Well, you did call him
a glorified high school science teacher

02:39.254 --> 02:42.435
whose last successful experiment
was lighting his own farts.

02:43.993 --> 02:45.016
In my defense,

02:45.208 --> 02:47.619
I prefaced that by saying,
"With all due respect."

02:49.000 --> 02:55.074

03:13.266 --> 03:14.273
Morning.

03:14.620 --> 03:15.620
Morning.

03:16.171 --> 03:17.967
You're making eggs for breakfast?

03:18.245 --> 03:20.675
This isn't breakfast,
it's an experiment.

03:22.866 --> 03:24.641
'Cause it looks a lot like breakfast.

03:25.164 --> 03:27.216
I finally have time
to test my hypothesis

03:27.413 --> 03:29.208
about the separation
of the water molecules

03:29.390 --> 03:32.303
from the egg proteins and its
impact vis-a-vis taste.

03:34.049 --> 03:35.049
Sounds yummy.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.161
I look forward
to your work with bacon.

03:38.606 --> 03:39.606
As do I.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.437
You know, I'm sure
if you just apologize

03:43.649 --> 03:45.639
to Gablehauser,
he would give you your job back.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.009
I don't want my job back.

03:47.515 --> 03:49.294
I've spent the past
three and a half years

03:49.452 --> 03:51.299
staring at grease boards
full of equations.

03:51.495 --> 03:53.920
Before that, I spent four years
working on my thesis.

03:54.074 --> 03:55.486
Before that, I was in college,

03:55.621 --> 03:57.648
and before that,
I was in the fifth grade.

03:59.045 --> 04:02.637
This is my first day off in decades
and I'm going to savor it.

04:05.077 --> 04:07.065
I'll let you get back
to fixing your eggs.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.913
Not just fixing my eggs,
I'm fixing everyone's eggs.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.301
And we all thank you.

04:43.873 --> 04:45.725
Use new eggs.

04:50.293 --> 04:52.338
I'm running out to the market.
You need anything?

04:53.496 --> 04:55.230
This would be
one of those circumstances

04:55.378 --> 04:58.766
that people unfamiliar with the law of
large numbers would call a coincidence.

04:59.426 --> 05:00.931
- I'm sorry?
- I need eggs.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.486
Four dozen should suffice.

05:02.739 --> 05:03.852
- Four dozen?
- Yes,

05:04.002 --> 05:05.848
and evenly distributed
amongst brown, white,

05:06.003 --> 05:08.396
free-range, large,
extra large and jumbo.

05:09.265 --> 05:10.346
Okay, one more time.

05:10.597 --> 05:12.417
Never mind.
You won't get it right.

05:12.940 --> 05:14.464
I'd better come with you.

05:21.552 --> 05:23.765
How come you didn't
go into work today?

05:23.858 --> 05:25.165
I'm taking a sabbatical

05:25.331 --> 05:27.802
because I won't kowtow
to mediocre minds.

05:28.463 --> 05:30.118
So you got canned, huh?

05:30.662 --> 05:33.209
Theoretical physicists
do not get canned...

05:34.215 --> 05:35.215
but yeah.

05:36.721 --> 05:38.033
Maybe it's all for the best.

05:38.173 --> 05:40.826
I always say when one door closes,
another one opens.

05:41.526 --> 05:42.798
No, it doesn't.

05:43.731 --> 05:46.000
Not unless the two doors
are connected by relays

05:46.154 --> 05:48.619
- or there are motion sensors involved.
- No, I meant...

05:48.754 --> 05:51.199
Or if the first door closing
creates a change of air pressure

05:51.334 --> 05:52.821
that acts upon the second door.

05:53.797 --> 05:54.797
Never mind.

05:56.516 --> 05:58.140
Slow down.

05:58.353 --> 06:00.620
- Please, slow down!
- We're fine!

06:00.766 --> 06:03.002
You're not leaving yourself
enough space between cars.

06:03.158 --> 06:05.891
- Oh, sure, I am.
- No, let me do the math for you.

06:06.011 --> 06:08.470
This car weighs,
let's say 4,000 pounds.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.615
Now add 140 for me,
120 for you...

06:10.971 --> 06:12.139
120?

06:12.525 --> 06:14.016
I'm sorry. Did I insult you?

06:14.209 --> 06:16.705
Is your body mass
somehow tied into your self-worth?

06:17.534 --> 06:18.557
Well, yeah.

06:19.384 --> 06:20.384
Interesting.

06:20.504 --> 06:22.408
Anyway, that gives us
a total weight of,

06:22.563 --> 06:24.140
let's say 4,400 pounds.

06:24.344 --> 06:25.577
Let's say 4,390.

06:26.458 --> 06:29.313
Fine. We're traveling forward at--

06:29.486 --> 06:31.203
good Lord-- 51 miles an hour.

06:31.830 --> 06:33.219
Let's assume that your brakes

06:33.393 --> 06:35.016
are new
and the calipers are aligned.

06:35.216 --> 06:36.839
Still, by the time we come
to a stop,

06:36.959 --> 06:39.529
we'll be occupying the same space
as that Buick in front of us,

06:39.722 --> 06:42.084
an impossibility that
nature will quickly resolve

06:42.253 --> 06:43.555
into death, mutilation...

06:43.710 --> 06:46.046
Oh, look, they built
a new putt-putt course.

06:49.730 --> 06:50.867
This is great.

06:51.382 --> 06:52.382
Look at me.

06:52.547 --> 06:54.367
I'm in the real world
of ordinary people

06:54.973 --> 06:57.879
just living their ordinary,
colorless workaday lives.

06:58.950 --> 06:59.953
Thank you.

07:00.146 --> 07:01.225
No, thankyou.

07:02.098 --> 07:03.991
And thank you, ordinary person.

07:06.429 --> 07:08.576
You want to hear
an interesting thing about tomatoes?

07:08.854 --> 07:10.034
No, not really.

07:10.206 --> 07:12.907
Listen, didn't you say
you need some eggs?

07:13.258 --> 07:16.435
Yes, but anyone who knows anything
about the dynamics of bacterial growth

07:16.589 --> 07:19.580
knows to pick up their refrigerated food
on the way out of the supermarket.

07:20.346 --> 07:22.563
Okay, then maybe you should start
heading on out then.

07:23.929 --> 07:25.548
No, this is fun.

07:25.956 --> 07:28.814
Oh, the thing about tomatoes--
and I think you'll really enjoy this--

07:29.093 --> 07:32.479
is they're shelved with the vegetables,
but they're technically a fruit.

07:32.691 --> 07:33.981
- Interesting.
- Isn't it?

07:34.142 --> 07:36.284
No, I mean
what you find enjoyable.

07:40.949 --> 07:41.949
Oh, boy.

07:43.757 --> 07:44.757
What now?

07:45.818 --> 07:48.217
Well, there's some value
to taking a multivitamin,

07:48.411 --> 07:50.494
but the human body
can only absorb so much.

07:50.675 --> 07:51.945
What you're buying here

07:52.179 --> 07:54.783
are the ingredients
for very expensive urine.

07:56.420 --> 07:58.970
Well, maybe that's what
I was going for.

07:59.444 --> 08:01.180
Then you'll want some manganese.

08:08.083 --> 08:09.541
That was fun.

08:09.661 --> 08:12.222
Maybe tomorrow we can go
to one of those big warehouse stores.

08:12.342 --> 08:13.518
Oh, I don't know.

08:13.719 --> 08:17.381
It's going to take me a while to recover
from all the fun I had today.

08:18.403 --> 08:19.403
Are you sure?

08:19.596 --> 08:21.533
There are a lot of advantages
to buying in bulk.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.215
For example, I noticed
that you purchase your tampons

08:24.408 --> 08:25.820
one-month supply at a time.

08:28.521 --> 08:29.505
What?

08:30.105 --> 08:32.130
Think about it.
It's a product that doesn't spoil

08:32.282 --> 08:35.549
and you're going to be needing them
for at least the next 30 years.

08:36.279 --> 08:38.889
You want me to buy 30 years
worth of tampons?

08:39.693 --> 08:42.298
Well, 30, 35.
When did your mother go into menopause?

08:44.277 --> 08:45.917
I'm not talking
about this with you.

08:47.378 --> 08:48.806
This is a natural human process,

08:48.960 --> 08:51.353
and we're talking about
statistically significant savings.

08:51.584 --> 08:55.289
Now, if you assume 15 tampons
per cycle and a 28-day cycle...

08:55.424 --> 08:56.948
Are you fairly regular?

09:02.118 --> 09:03.372
Okay, no warehouse store,

09:03.507 --> 09:05.630
but we're still on
for putt-putt golf, right?

09:11.845 --> 09:14.483
Hey, I just ran into Penny.
She seemed upset about something.

09:14.927 --> 09:16.991
I think it's her time of the month.

09:19.401 --> 09:21.832
I marked the calendar
for future reference.

09:25.211 --> 09:26.738
What's with the fish?

09:27.715 --> 09:29.165
It's an experiment.

09:30.576 --> 09:32.456
What happened
to your scrambled egg research?

09:32.627 --> 09:33.881
Oh, that was a dead end.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.871
Scrambled eggs are as good
as they're ever going to be.

09:37.529 --> 09:39.630
So... fish?

09:41.337 --> 09:43.265
I read an article
about Japanese scientists

09:43.427 --> 09:46.148
who inserted DNA from luminous
jellyfish into other animals,

09:46.415 --> 09:49.444
and I thought,
"Hey, fish nightlights."

09:52.998 --> 09:54.289
Fish nightlights?

09:54.653 --> 09:56.274
It's a billion-dollar idea.

09:58.807 --> 09:59.807
Mum's the word.

10:01.492 --> 10:02.977
Are you sure you don't want

10:03.112 --> 10:05.601
to just apologize to Gablehauser
and get your job back?

10:06.668 --> 10:08.135
No, I have too much to do.

10:09.518 --> 10:10.670
Like luminous fish.

10:11.634 --> 10:13.100
I'm sorry.
I didn't...

10:15.051 --> 10:16.324
That's just the beginning.

10:16.688 --> 10:17.888
I also have an idea

10:18.081 --> 10:20.688
for a bulk mail-order
feminine hygiene company.

10:20.893 --> 10:22.852
Oh, glow-in-the-dark tampons!

10:26.254 --> 10:28.106
Leonard, we're gonna be rich.

10:32.167 --> 10:34.085
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

10:34.220 --> 10:36.897
- You did the right thing calling.
- I didn't know what else to do.

10:37.051 --> 10:40.194
He's lost all focus.
Every day he's got a new obsession.

10:47.126 --> 10:49.576
This is a particularly disturbing one.

10:52.589 --> 10:53.589
Mommy?

10:54.743 --> 10:56.439
Hi, baby!

11:05.205 --> 11:08.408
Oh, you got yourself a loom?
How nice!

11:09.070 --> 11:10.070
Thank you.

11:10.253 --> 11:12.047
Honey, why'd you get a loom?

11:13.470 --> 11:16.171
I was working with luminous fish,
and I thought...

11:18.711 --> 11:19.676
"loom."

11:22.308 --> 11:24.276
Mom, what are you doing here?

11:24.580 --> 11:25.814
Leonard called me.

11:26.326 --> 11:27.908
I know, but why?

11:28.373 --> 11:30.741
Because one of the great minds
of the 21st century

11:30.877 --> 11:34.118
is raising glow-in-the-dark fish
and weaving serapes.

11:35.064 --> 11:37.449
This is not a serape,
this is a poncho.

11:37.624 --> 11:39.721
A serape is open at the sides;
a poncho is closed.

11:39.850 --> 11:40.869
This is a poncho.

11:41.004 --> 11:43.743
And neither is a reason
to call someone'smother.

11:45.477 --> 11:47.731
Really? When was the last time
you left the house?

11:48.621 --> 11:50.049
I went to the market with Penny.

11:50.242 --> 11:51.715
That was three weeks ago.

11:52.139 --> 11:54.471
Well, then buckle up!
In the next four to eight days

11:54.626 --> 11:56.538
she's going to get very crabby.

11:59.065 --> 12:01.862
Sweetheart, your little friend
is concerned about you.

12:02.067 --> 12:04.384
Yes, well, I'm not a child--
I'm a grown man,

12:04.556 --> 12:06.539
capable of living my life as I see fit.

12:06.659 --> 12:09.696
And I certainly don't need someone
telling on me to my mother!

12:11.104 --> 12:12.416
Wait, where are you going?

12:12.589 --> 12:14.885
To my room.
And no one's allowed in!

12:17.443 --> 12:19.122
He gets his temper
from his daddy.

12:20.208 --> 12:21.288
He's got my eyes.

12:21.531 --> 12:22.553
I see.

12:22.974 --> 12:25.566
All that science stuff,
that comes from Jesus.

12:29.525 --> 12:32.110
- Sheldon, your mom made dinner.
- I'm not hungry!

12:33.210 --> 12:35.185
Don't trouble yourself.
He's stubborn.

12:35.376 --> 12:37.261
He may stay in there till the Rapture.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.884
We so sure that's abadthing?

12:41.462 --> 12:43.081
I tell you,
I love the boy to death,

12:43.236 --> 12:46.624
but he has been difficult since
he fell out of me at the K-Mart.

12:49.204 --> 12:50.658
Excuse me for being so bold,

12:50.820 --> 12:54.254
but I now see where Sheldon
gets his smoldering good looks.

12:56.153 --> 12:58.545
Honey, that ain't gonna work,
but you keep tryin'.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.163
I made chicken.

13:01.963 --> 13:05.904
I hope that isn't one of the animals
that you people think is magic.

13:12.008 --> 13:14.512
You know, we have an Indian
gentleman at our church,

13:14.724 --> 13:17.047
a Dr. Patel--
Tt's a beautiful story.

13:17.240 --> 13:21.659
The Lord spoke to him and moved him
to give us all 20% off on Lasik--

13:21.812 --> 13:23.390
You know, those that needed it.

13:24.336 --> 13:25.670
That is a lovely story.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.921
Are we gonna do anything about Sheldon?

13:28.077 --> 13:30.543
Oh, we will.
You have to take your time with Sheldon.

13:30.937 --> 13:33.156
His father, God rest his soul,
used to always say to me,

13:33.357 --> 13:36.097
"Mary, you have to take
your time with Sheldon."

13:37.390 --> 13:40.214
- Sounds like a wise man.
- Oh, not so wise.

13:40.407 --> 13:43.029
He once tried to fight a bobcat
for some licorice.

13:44.278 --> 13:46.343
So, everybody
grab a plate

13:46.617 --> 13:49.167
and a pretty place mat
that Shelly wove.

13:49.887 --> 13:51.961
Has Shelly ever freaked out
like this before?

13:52.121 --> 13:53.393
Oh, all the time.

13:53.663 --> 13:55.861
I remember one summer
when he was 13,

13:56.141 --> 13:58.726
he built a small nuclear
reactor in the shed

13:59.429 --> 14:02.626
and told everybody he was gonna provide
free electricity for the whole town.

14:02.793 --> 14:04.086
Well, the only problem was,

14:04.240 --> 14:06.729
he had no what you call
"fissionable" materials.

14:08.001 --> 14:10.715
Anyway, when he went on the Internets
to get some,

14:10.934 --> 14:14.432
a man from the government
came by and sat him down

14:14.664 --> 14:17.107
real gentle, and told him
it's against the law

14:17.261 --> 14:19.112
to have yellow-cake uranium
in a shed.

14:20.602 --> 14:22.898
- What happened?
- Well, poor boy had a fit.

14:23.067 --> 14:26.038
Locked himself in his room
and built a sonic death ray.

14:27.204 --> 14:28.207
A death ray?

14:28.458 --> 14:31.621
That's what he called it.
Didn't even slow down the neighbor kids.

14:33.197 --> 14:35.087
It pissed our dog off to no end.

14:37.447 --> 14:39.496
You know, you two
make a cute couple.

14:41.366 --> 14:43.221
No. We're not...
we're not-not a couple.

14:43.368 --> 14:44.654
We're singles. Two singles.

14:44.780 --> 14:48.139
Like those... individuly wrapped
slices of cheese that...

14:50.454 --> 14:51.657
We're friends.

14:53.195 --> 14:55.390
- Did I pluck a nerve there?
- Oh, yeah.

14:55.802 --> 14:57.654
All right, everybody,
it's time to eat.

14:59.037 --> 15:01.462
Oh, Lord,
we thank You for this meal

15:01.664 --> 15:03.266
and all of Your bounty.

15:04.357 --> 15:05.845
And we pray that You help Sheldon

15:06.014 --> 15:07.589
get back on his rocker.

15:08.725 --> 15:11.023
Now, after a moment
of silent meditation,

15:11.143 --> 15:13.194
I'm gonna end with
"In Jesus' name,"

15:13.368 --> 15:15.613
but you two don't feel
any obligation to join in.

15:17.431 --> 15:19.791
Unless, of course,
the Holy Spirit moves you.

15:29.759 --> 15:32.367
Oh, my God, this is the
best cobbler I've ever had.

15:32.563 --> 15:34.157
It was always Sheldon's favorite.

15:34.277 --> 15:36.260
You know what
the secret ingredient is?

15:36.730 --> 15:38.055
- Love?
- Lard.

15:43.486 --> 15:44.769
Hey, look who's come...

15:45.233 --> 15:46.468
You'll spook him.

15:48.753 --> 15:51.375
He's like a baby deer.
You got to let him come to you.

15:59.830 --> 16:02.879
This is ridiculous.
Damn it, Sheldon, snap out of it!

16:03.225 --> 16:04.316
You're a physicist--

16:04.480 --> 16:07.210
You belong at the university
doing research, not hiding in your room!

16:14.914 --> 16:16.149
You don't hunt, do you?

16:22.895 --> 16:24.767
Good morning, snickerdoodle.

16:26.242 --> 16:27.340
Morning.

16:27.621 --> 16:29.971
Well, that looks awful fancy.
What is that?

16:31.698 --> 16:33.745
It's my idea
of what DNA would look like

16:33.919 --> 16:35.631
in a silicon-based life-form.

16:37.360 --> 16:41.001
But intelligently designed
by a creator, right?

16:43.603 --> 16:44.764
What do you want, Mom?

16:45.273 --> 16:49.208
You know how your daddy used to say
that you can only fish for so long

16:49.445 --> 16:51.954
before you got to throw a
stick of dynamite in the water?

16:53.579 --> 16:55.258
Well, I'm done fishing.

16:57.219 --> 16:58.223
You put those on.

16:58.415 --> 16:59.928
- What for?
- Because you're gonna

17:00.058 --> 17:02.094
go down to your office,
you're gonna apologize

17:02.214 --> 17:03.782
to your boss
and get your job back.

17:04.269 --> 17:05.362
No.
I'm sorry,

17:05.516 --> 17:07.373
did I start that sentence
with the words,

17:07.508 --> 17:09.273
"If it please Your Highness"?

17:11.578 --> 17:14.300
I'm not going to apologize--
I didn't say anything that wasn't true.

17:14.446 --> 17:15.806
Now, you listen here.

17:15.984 --> 17:18.516
I have been telling you
since you were four years old,

17:18.674 --> 17:20.560
it's okay to be smarter
than everybody,

17:20.699 --> 17:22.416
but you can't go around
pointing it out.

17:22.705 --> 17:25.257
- Why not?
- Because people don't like it!

17:26.954 --> 17:29.599
Remember all the ass-kickings
you got from the neighbor kids?

17:32.638 --> 17:34.297
Now, let's get crackin'.

17:34.612 --> 17:37.262
Shower, shirt, shoes,
and let's shove off.

17:40.012 --> 17:41.731
There wouldn't have been
any ass-kickings

17:41.894 --> 17:43.785
if that stupid death ray
had worked.

17:48.682 --> 17:49.682
Problem solved.

17:50.835 --> 17:52.983
Really? That's impressive.

17:53.401 --> 17:56.160
Leonard, the Lord never gives
us more than we can handle.

17:56.699 --> 17:58.952
Thankfully, He blessed me
with two other children

17:59.107 --> 18:00.333
who are dumb as soup.

18:06.301 --> 18:08.316
Excuse me, Dr. Gablehauser,
are you busy?

18:08.489 --> 18:10.534
- Well, actually...
- Sheldon, he's just doodlin'.

18:10.689 --> 18:11.788
Get in here.

18:19.118 --> 18:21.313
Let's go, baby.
We're losing daylight.

18:25.881 --> 18:26.938
As you know,

18:27.150 --> 18:29.755
several weeks ago
in our first encounter,

18:30.241 --> 18:32.044
we may have gotten off
on the wrong foot

18:32.199 --> 18:33.909
when I called you an idiot.

18:35.121 --> 18:37.616
And I just wanted to say
that I was wrong...

18:38.160 --> 18:39.376
to point it out.

18:42.651 --> 18:44.484
I'm sorry,
we haven't been introduced.

18:46.881 --> 18:47.979
Sheldon's mom.

18:48.230 --> 18:51.403
Now, that's impossible! You must
have had him when you were a teenager.

18:51.686 --> 18:53.933
Oh, aren't you sweet.
His father's dead.

18:56.992 --> 18:58.569
- Recently?
- Long enough.

18:59.687 --> 19:00.746
Please.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.743
Sheldon, shouldn't you be working?

19:14.969 --> 19:16.050
Hey, how did it go?

19:16.900 --> 19:18.057
I got my job back.

19:18.247 --> 19:19.694
Really?
What happened?

19:20.675 --> 19:22.125
I'm not quite sure.

19:23.309 --> 19:25.219
It involves a part
of the human experience

19:25.354 --> 19:27.089
that has always eluded me.

19:28.114 --> 19:29.735
That narrows it down.

19:33.403 --> 19:34.860
I'm very proud of you honey.

19:35.053 --> 19:36.872
You showed a lot of courage today.

19:37.814 --> 19:38.854
Thanks, Mom.

19:45.303 --> 19:48.139
Is Dr. Gablehauser going
to be my new daddy?

19:51.537 --> 19:52.577
We'll see.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.275
Sleep tight.
