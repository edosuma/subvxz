00:13.162 --> 00:15.196
Oh, Frasier, I'm sorry.

00:15.264 --> 00:16.797
I must have fallen asleep.

00:16.798 --> 00:17.898
What time is it?

00:17.899 --> 00:19.167
Well, it's pretty late.

00:19.235 --> 00:21.336
Uh, I guess I...
I'll go downstairs

00:21.403 --> 00:23.571
and, uh, sleep on the couch.

00:23.639 --> 00:25.106
Maybe I should just go.

00:25.174 --> 00:27.475
No, no, you don't
have to go home.

00:27.543 --> 00:30.245
You don't have to
sleep on the couch.

00:32.848 --> 00:34.715
Just a second.

00:40.455 --> 00:42.807
(door opening and closing)

00:42.875 --> 00:44.676
Frasier, what was that?

00:44.743 --> 00:46.611
What was what?

00:46.679 --> 00:48.580
I thought I heard a door slam.

00:48.581 --> 00:50.648
You don't think those
guys are back, do you?

00:50.649 --> 00:52.750
No. No, impossible.
I locked and dead-bolted it.

00:52.751 --> 00:55.387
They'd need a key to get in.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.739
Now, where were we?

01:01.661 --> 01:03.929
Let's make this a night
we'll never forget.

01:15.257 --> 01:16.907
Frasier.

01:16.975 --> 01:19.160
Lilith?

01:22.031 --> 01:23.998
Rebecca?!

01:27.102 --> 01:30.839
Am I the only one
who feels awkward here?

01:30.840 --> 01:31.906
Where is Frederick?

01:31.907 --> 01:33.375
I didn't see him in his room.

01:33.442 --> 01:35.309
He's with your mother.

01:35.378 --> 01:38.688
Fine. Then I'll just go and let you
do whatever it was you were doing.

01:40.683 --> 01:42.149
Lilith!

01:44.487 --> 01:45.620
Lilith!

01:47.857 --> 01:50.859
It was nice to see
you again, Lilith.

01:54.162 --> 01:55.947

02:38.891 --> 02:42.193
All right, exactly how
long has this been going on?!

02:42.261 --> 02:43.995
Lilith?

02:44.063 --> 02:45.447
What's the matter, Sam?

02:45.514 --> 02:47.248
You look like you've
seen a ghost.

02:47.316 --> 02:49.800
Oh, I'm sorry.
You did.

02:52.338 --> 02:55.206
Lilith, I-I-I thought
you were in that, uh...

02:55.274 --> 02:56.574
I've left the Eco-pod.

02:56.642 --> 02:59.277
For a job at a gas station?

03:00.929 --> 03:02.647
Look... everybody,
Lilith!

03:02.715 --> 03:04.048
Well, my goodness...

03:04.116 --> 03:06.984
uh, the-the, you know,
the time in the pod thing

03:07.053 --> 03:08.886
has really done you
a world of...

03:08.954 --> 03:10.221
You look so...

03:10.289 --> 03:13.407
Your skin is, uh...

03:13.475 --> 03:16.261
Hey, Lilith's back, huh?

03:17.663 --> 03:19.130
Sam, please!

03:19.198 --> 03:20.932
Tell me what's been going on!

03:21.000 --> 03:22.133
How long has Frasier

03:22.201 --> 03:23.768
been sleeping with Rebecca?

03:23.835 --> 03:26.054
Beg your pardon?

03:26.122 --> 03:30.391
Did he at least have the courtesy
to wait until I was in the ground?

03:33.846 --> 03:36.130
Lil... Lil...

03:36.165 --> 03:38.499
Frasier's not sleeping
with Rebecca!

03:38.500 --> 03:40.635
Oh, well, perhaps you
should tell them that.

03:40.636 --> 03:42.870
I just saw them in
my bed together.

03:42.871 --> 03:44.555
Rebecca and Frasier-
you're kidding me.

03:44.556 --> 03:46.186
How long has this
been going on?

03:46.225 --> 03:47.792
I'm asking you!

03:51.163 --> 03:53.280
I can't believe...

03:53.348 --> 03:55.717
We... we were just over there!

03:55.784 --> 03:58.452
We, we were watching
Three Stooges tapes with him.

03:58.453 --> 04:00.121
NORM:
Well, maybe she was upstairs

04:00.122 --> 04:02.023
the whole time and
we didn't know about it.

04:02.024 --> 04:03.191
Well, yeah, after we left,

04:03.192 --> 04:05.193
maybe he just toddled on
upstairs

04:05.261 --> 04:07.131
and gave her the old
nyuk-nyuk-nyuk.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.214
Rebecca and Frasier...

04:10.282 --> 04:13.172
Am I to understand this is a
relatively new development?

04:13.173 --> 04:16.837
Big news to us.
CLIFF: Who would have thought it?

04:16.838 --> 04:18.623
Rebecca and Frasier, huh?

04:18.690 --> 04:21.659
What's next, me and Carla?

04:21.726 --> 04:23.961
(grunts)

04:24.029 --> 04:28.433
Don't say it, Clavin,
don't you even think it.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.100
See that?

04:30.168 --> 04:31.769
It almost turned into a kiss.

04:31.903 --> 04:36.023
You know what?
I think this is good for them.

04:36.024 --> 04:37.925
They've been moping around
the last couple of months,

04:37.926 --> 04:39.560
mooning about their
love life and everything.

04:39.561 --> 04:40.862
They found each other.

04:40.929 --> 04:42.213
This is very nice, I think.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.330
Yeah.

04:43.349 --> 04:45.249
Well, hear-hear!

04:45.318 --> 04:46.551
To Rebecca and Frasier!

04:46.552 --> 04:47.652
(all agreeing)

04:47.653 --> 04:49.153
LILITH:
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

04:49.221 --> 04:51.089
I'm still in the room!

04:51.157 --> 04:53.191
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry, Lilith.

04:53.258 --> 04:55.060
I can't believe
this has happened.

04:55.127 --> 04:57.195
I come home to resume my life

04:57.262 --> 05:00.431
and find that my husband
has taken up with another woman.

05:00.499 --> 05:03.150
Well, why don't you... why
don't you take your coat off,

05:03.218 --> 05:05.653
sit down and just
cool out for a while?

05:05.721 --> 05:07.922
Oh, I can't, Sam-
I'm too wound up.

05:07.923 --> 05:10.257
I've got half a mind
to go back to that bedroom

05:10.258 --> 05:11.993
and wring Frasier's neck.

05:12.061 --> 05:15.251
Frasier's...? Aren't you being a
little out of line here, Lilith?

05:15.252 --> 05:16.981
I mean, the guy's
only being human.

05:16.982 --> 05:20.385
You were the one who walked
out of here with another man.

05:20.452 --> 05:22.453
Oh, God, you're right.

05:22.521 --> 05:25.456
It's just that
I wanted to come back so badly

05:25.524 --> 05:27.458
and resume my life.

05:27.526 --> 05:29.143
As naive and selfish

05:29.210 --> 05:32.897
as it sounds, I just assumed
he would be waiting for me.

05:34.132 --> 05:35.566
Listen, go get some sleep.

05:35.634 --> 05:37.268
I'll bet you in the morning

05:37.335 --> 05:40.671
you and Frasier
can work things out.

05:40.739 --> 05:42.540
That's a good
idea, Sam. Yeah.

05:42.608 --> 05:44.809
Where am I gonna sleep?

05:44.877 --> 05:46.677
I wanted to stay at home,

05:46.745 --> 05:49.213
and now I've got
no place to go.

05:49.281 --> 05:52.016
I've got an attic
you can hang upside down in.

05:53.318 --> 05:55.486
(taps bar)

06:02.861 --> 06:06.797
Sam, if you could lend me
a little money for a hotel,

06:06.798 --> 06:09.267
I'd really appreciate it.
No problem, no problem.

06:09.268 --> 06:10.468
Thank you.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.203
You know, I'll be right back.

06:12.271 --> 06:15.573
I'm going to call my mother
and check up on Frederick.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.575
You know, I have to say that

06:17.576 --> 06:19.310
after being
cooped up underground

06:19.311 --> 06:22.880
for the last six months, it's
very nice to see people again.

06:24.599 --> 06:26.417
Even you people.

06:28.253 --> 06:30.454
That was sweet.

06:30.522 --> 06:32.440
Can you believe this stuff?

06:32.508 --> 06:35.009
Yeah, I'd like to see the
look on Frasier's face

06:35.077 --> 06:37.011
when Lilith walked in.

06:37.079 --> 06:38.746
I'm sure he was shocked.

06:38.813 --> 06:40.498
I mean, what
would you do, Norm,

06:40.566 --> 06:43.401
if you walked in and found
Vera with another man?

06:43.402 --> 06:45.586
Well, I'd probably buy
a couple of his pencils

06:45.587 --> 06:47.588
and send him on his way.

06:50.476 --> 06:52.343
Frederick is fine.

06:52.411 --> 06:54.011
I worry, though, sometimes

06:54.079 --> 06:57.081
that my mother may be too
overprotective and smothering.

06:57.149 --> 07:00.301
You got to watch that-
that'll really screw a kid up.

07:01.953 --> 07:03.905
Here's your money.

07:03.973 --> 07:05.473
Thank you, Sam.

07:05.540 --> 07:07.876
So, that, uh...

07:07.943 --> 07:11.145
pod thing didn't work out, huh?

07:11.213 --> 07:13.681
Suffice it to say
that Dr. Pascal and I

07:13.682 --> 07:15.283
determined that two human beings

07:15.284 --> 07:17.285
cannot live together
underground.

07:17.352 --> 07:20.070
You and I could, Norm.

07:22.174 --> 07:24.575
Would you stop
saying that, Cliff?

07:25.812 --> 07:27.879
Lilith. Here you are.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.630
I've been looking
all over for you.

07:29.648 --> 07:31.582
What in the world
are you doing here?

07:31.650 --> 07:33.017
I've come home, Frasier.

07:33.085 --> 07:34.902
Oh, my God.

07:34.903 --> 07:37.204
I've left the pod, and I
spent the last three days

07:37.205 --> 07:38.806
on a bus to come home to you.

07:38.873 --> 07:41.142
I don't understand.
Frasier,

07:41.210 --> 07:44.378
I realize that my leaving
you was very hurtful,

07:44.446 --> 07:46.447
and I understand
your seeking comfort

07:46.514 --> 07:48.616
in the arms of another woman.

07:48.684 --> 07:50.217
We won't mention it.

07:50.285 --> 07:54.956
We'll just put it behind us
and-and get on with our lives.

07:55.023 --> 07:57.357
What I'm trying to
say, Frasier, is...

07:57.358 --> 07:58.442
You want me back?

07:58.443 --> 08:00.278
Oh, yes, I want you back!

08:00.279 --> 08:01.445
You hear that, everybody?

08:01.446 --> 08:03.281
Frasier and Lilith
are back together again!

08:03.282 --> 08:04.849
Aw, it makes me so happy!

08:04.917 --> 08:07.551
Here, free drinks on the house!
All right!

08:07.619 --> 08:09.870
Just a minute, Sam-
I haven't taken her back.

08:09.938 --> 08:12.106
Oh, sorry, Mr. Peterson.

08:15.277 --> 08:18.079
Wait, wait, come on, now.

08:18.146 --> 08:20.348
Now, you two kids
belong together.

08:20.415 --> 08:21.715
Come on.

08:21.783 --> 08:23.234
The unmitigated gall!

08:23.235 --> 08:25.570
You think you can walk back into
my life and patch it up again

08:25.571 --> 08:27.638
as quickly as
you destroyed it?! Frasier, I'm sorry.

08:27.639 --> 08:29.406
All right, she's sorry-
beers for everybody!

08:29.407 --> 08:30.841
Come on.

08:30.909 --> 08:31.959
Frasier, please.

08:32.027 --> 08:34.628
More than anything,
I want our life back.

08:34.696 --> 08:37.063
What about your
boyfriend, Dr. Pascal?

08:37.131 --> 08:39.566
I don't love him.
I love you.

08:39.634 --> 08:41.052
(chuckling):
Oh, really?

08:41.053 --> 08:43.654
So you've come back
to reliable old Frasier, have you?

08:43.655 --> 08:44.722
And for how long?

08:44.790 --> 08:46.840
Till somebody opens
a colony on Venus?!

08:46.841 --> 08:47.959
Frasier, don't be ridiculous.

08:47.960 --> 08:51.162
If we go to Venus, I think
we should do it as a family.

08:53.131 --> 08:56.568
(panting):
Lilith, I have to talk to you in private.

08:56.635 --> 09:00.555
(others hooting)

09:00.622 --> 09:02.673
Okay, it doesn't
have to be in private.

09:02.674 --> 09:04.409
Lilith, listen,
please let me explain.

09:04.410 --> 09:06.877
Rebecca, you don't have to
explain anything to her.

09:06.878 --> 09:08.880
You and I can pick up
right where we left off.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.732
Really?
Absolutely!

09:10.799 --> 09:14.568
Come on over here
and give me a big wet one.

09:14.636 --> 09:16.037
Frasier, let me just

09:16.104 --> 09:18.874
speak to you in
my office, please. Oh, okay, even better.

09:18.941 --> 09:20.908
Heh! Sam, hold
my calls, will you?

09:20.976 --> 09:22.459
Sofa pulls out, you know.

09:24.212 --> 09:26.330
Sorry things aren't working out.

09:26.397 --> 09:28.899
Is there anything
I can do for you?

09:28.967 --> 09:31.636
It isn't over, yet, Sam.

09:31.703 --> 09:33.004
I know my Frasier.

09:33.005 --> 09:35.172
He doesn't take well
to sudden developments,

09:35.173 --> 09:36.473
but he'll come around.

09:36.541 --> 09:38.742
I'm as determined
to get him back

09:38.810 --> 09:40.845
as I was to leave him.

09:40.912 --> 09:42.396
Well, that's...

09:42.464 --> 09:45.166
that's good, that's good.

09:45.234 --> 09:46.934
Frasier, um...

09:47.002 --> 09:50.671
listen, I know that Lilith
coming back changes everything,

09:50.739 --> 09:54.008
and... so I'm just gonna
step out of the picture

09:54.076 --> 09:56.577
and... and there's
no hard feelings.

09:56.644 --> 09:59.413
That bitch!

09:59.414 --> 10:01.349
Thinks she can waltz
back into my life

10:01.350 --> 10:02.767
and start calling the shots?

10:02.768 --> 10:07.805
I know that what we almost had
was very special, but...

10:07.806 --> 10:09.607
we have a very
special friendship, too,

10:09.608 --> 10:12.510
so I think that we should
just leave it at that.

10:12.577 --> 10:14.428
Eco-pod my big white butt!

10:14.496 --> 10:16.931
I was that close to popping her,
you know that?

10:16.999 --> 10:20.134
If she weren't the mother
of my child, I'd have done it!

10:20.135 --> 10:21.652
I-I think we should
just focus here,

10:21.653 --> 10:24.055
because, y-you know, Frasier,
I'm trying to be very gentle,

10:24.056 --> 10:25.890
because I want
to let you down easy.

10:25.957 --> 10:27.758
I don't want
to break your heart.

10:27.826 --> 10:29.996
"I spent three days on a bus,"
wah, wah, wah.

10:30.062 --> 10:32.864
Well, cry me a river, bun-head!

10:32.865 --> 10:35.066
For God's sake, Frasier,
will you listen to me!

10:35.067 --> 10:36.667
I'm trying
to tell you something!

10:36.668 --> 10:39.336
Oh. I'm sorry, Rebecca.

10:39.404 --> 10:41.205
I've been rude; I apologize.

10:41.272 --> 10:44.008
It's just, I can't believe
that she's come back.

10:44.076 --> 10:46.177
Frasier...

10:46.245 --> 10:48.546
you know, what we almost did,

10:48.613 --> 10:51.382
I think it would
have been real special,

10:51.450 --> 10:53.150
but...

10:53.218 --> 10:56.970
I think maybe it's better that
we just remain good friends.

10:58.289 --> 11:00.958
I suppose you're right.

11:01.025 --> 11:03.627
Well, what might
have been, huh?

11:05.864 --> 11:07.464
For what it's worth,

11:07.532 --> 11:09.633
I'm sorry things
didn't work out.

11:09.701 --> 11:11.435
(knocking)

11:11.436 --> 11:13.270
Hi. Can I talk
to Rebecca alone, please?

11:13.271 --> 11:14.271
Bar business.

11:14.272 --> 11:15.706
Sure, Sam.

11:15.774 --> 11:18.075
Oh, God, Sam,

11:18.142 --> 11:20.678
why do I always screw
everything up?!

11:20.746 --> 11:23.247
All I was doing was giving
a friend a ride home.

11:23.248 --> 11:25.048
And then you know
how things happen.

11:25.049 --> 11:26.751
You know, a kiss leads to a hug

11:26.752 --> 11:28.018
and a hug leads to the bed,

11:28.019 --> 11:29.319
and then the wife comes in

11:29.388 --> 11:31.939
and wants to know
what you're doing there.

11:35.777 --> 11:38.595
Why do I always make
such a mess of things?!

11:40.249 --> 11:42.383
So who was better,
me or Frasier?

11:42.451 --> 11:43.567
Oh!

11:44.354 --> 11:46.436
What?

11:46.437 --> 11:49.106
I-I don't have feelings, too?!

11:49.174 --> 11:52.076
Frasier, I know that
I've hurt you,

11:52.077 --> 11:53.844
and I realize now
that the only way

11:53.845 --> 11:55.846
to get you back is to beg.

11:55.914 --> 11:56.997
So here I go.

11:57.065 --> 11:58.115
I'm sorry, Lilith.

11:58.166 --> 11:59.550
Begging won't work.

11:59.551 --> 12:01.719
I'm not gonna hang around
and be the safety net

12:01.720 --> 12:04.989
every time you fall from one
of your flights of fancy.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.024
That boat has sailed.

12:07.092 --> 12:09.227
That gate has closed.

12:09.294 --> 12:12.096
Alice doesn't live
here anymore.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.501
Damn you, Frasier!

12:16.502 --> 12:18.369
I know that somewhere
inside of you,

12:18.370 --> 12:19.937
you still have deep feelings
for me,

12:19.938 --> 12:21.038
and I'm willing to wait.

12:21.039 --> 12:22.673
If I have to wait
a hundred years,

12:22.674 --> 12:24.004
I'm going to get you back!

12:24.042 --> 12:25.392
You hear that, guys?

12:25.460 --> 12:27.461
Come on, free beer, let's go.

12:27.529 --> 12:29.897
Aw, Lilith.

12:29.964 --> 12:31.132
Louis!

12:31.199 --> 12:33.000
Pascal! What are
you doing here?

12:33.068 --> 12:34.201
Try to stop me, Crane.

12:34.202 --> 12:36.203
I've come to take Lilith
back to our home

12:36.204 --> 12:37.471
under the dirt,
where we're safe.

12:37.472 --> 12:40.123
Louis, I'm not
going back there.

12:40.124 --> 12:42.726
How can you abandon the oneness
of our subterranean life

12:42.727 --> 12:44.362
for this world of surfies?

12:45.130 --> 12:47.681
Surface dwellers.

12:47.749 --> 12:49.467
Because this

12:49.535 --> 12:50.801
is where I want to be.

12:50.869 --> 12:53.759
Our experiment failed, Louis,
and so did our love affair.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.139
I'm not leaving without you,
Lilith.

12:55.140 --> 12:56.974
I demand that you accompany me
this instant.

12:56.975 --> 12:58.608
And if I don't?

12:58.676 --> 13:00.394
Then I'll be forced
to shoot you

13:00.462 --> 13:02.796
a-a-and everyone else
in this bar.

13:02.864 --> 13:05.616
What's it gonna be?

13:05.617 --> 13:07.318
Louis, I'm not going
back with you.

13:07.319 --> 13:09.887
So I guess you're just going
to have to shoot us.

13:15.027 --> 13:17.028
Welcome back, Lilith.

13:25.437 --> 13:28.989
I'm warning you,
unless Lilith agrees to go back with me,

13:29.024 --> 13:30.624
you're all dead.

13:30.726 --> 13:32.492
You don't scare me, Pascal.

13:32.561 --> 13:33.894
Yeah? Why not?

13:33.979 --> 13:36.730
Because I happen
to own every copy

13:36.798 --> 13:38.799
of Soldier of Fortune
ever published.

13:38.867 --> 13:42.403
I'm telling you people,
no "ifs" "ands" or "buts",

13:42.470 --> 13:45.639
that there's no working pistol
with that configuration.

13:45.641 --> 13:47.858
(gunshot) (shrieks)

13:47.910 --> 13:50.478
I did miss the Christmas issue.

13:52.247 --> 13:54.765
All right, get back, get back!

13:54.832 --> 13:56.333
Don't push me.

13:56.401 --> 13:58.101
The importance of the Eco-pod

13:58.170 --> 14:00.437
is far greater
than any one human life.

14:00.472 --> 14:02.606
Sam...

14:03.976 --> 14:07.828
John, John,
it's not a good time.

14:07.846 --> 14:10.781
Sam, I've put up with your rock
and roll music,

14:10.849 --> 14:13.550
your loud parties
and your fights.

14:13.618 --> 14:16.753
But now you've shot Ruben
the busboy in the foot.

14:16.754 --> 14:21.208
He's an undocumented alien
without health insurance,

14:21.209 --> 14:23.677
and that puts me
in a bit of a jam.

14:23.695 --> 14:26.864
Oh...

14:26.931 --> 14:28.699
A bigger jam.

14:28.834 --> 14:30.885
Everybody but Lilith
behind the bar!

14:33.255 --> 14:35.973
(phone rings)

14:38.260 --> 14:40.610
All right, answer the phone,
but act natural.

14:43.781 --> 14:45.582
Cheers.

14:45.650 --> 14:47.351
Just a second.

14:47.419 --> 14:51.688
Mr. Peterson,
it's Mrs. Peterson.

14:51.756 --> 14:53.590
See, it's my wife.

14:53.658 --> 14:55.392
Um, I'll get rid of her.

14:55.460 --> 14:56.960
(quietly):
Woody, cover me.

14:58.697 --> 14:59.796
Uh, Vera?

14:59.864 --> 15:01.399
Uh, yes, yes, I know it's late.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.901
You see, we're
being held hostage by a mad gunman, and...

15:03.902 --> 15:08.339
What do you mean I've
used that one before?

15:08.407 --> 15:11.858
No-no-no, you see, no-no, honey,
wait, wait, hey, hey!

15:11.926 --> 15:14.561
(receiver clicks)

15:14.663 --> 15:15.873
Put the gun down, Louis.

15:15.930 --> 15:18.132
Why are you being so foolish?

15:18.200 --> 15:20.067
Because I can't live
without you!

15:20.135 --> 15:21.835
I miss you.

15:21.836 --> 15:23.471
And Dr. Jaworski
misses you, too.

15:23.472 --> 15:25.406
FRASIER:
Dr. Jaworski?!

15:25.407 --> 15:27.992
What? There were three
scientists in the Eco-pod?

15:27.993 --> 15:29.626
Did you sleep with him, too?!

15:29.678 --> 15:32.279
Dr. Jaworski
isn't a scientist.

15:32.347 --> 15:36.283
He's Loui' imaginary friend.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.288
Did I forget to mention
that Louis is insane?

15:41.356 --> 15:43.324
Turns out he's claustrophobic.

15:43.325 --> 15:45.492
We discovered that
little fact about 30 seconds

15:45.493 --> 15:49.162
after they closed
the steel doors.

15:49.197 --> 15:50.414
(knocking)

15:50.415 --> 15:52.450
PAUL: Hey, guys, I know you're
having a party in there.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.167
Let me in.

15:54.202 --> 15:55.453
Who's that at the hatch?

15:55.504 --> 15:57.254
That's nobody,
nobody important.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.955
We'll see about that.

15:59.266 --> 16:01.658
So what's the big secret?

16:01.659 --> 16:02.993
What's going on?

16:03.095 --> 16:04.878
Paul, we're being held hostage!

16:04.963 --> 16:06.580
Fine, then don't tell me.

16:06.647 --> 16:09.316
Get with the others.

16:10.468 --> 16:12.578
Actually, I don't belong
with the others.

16:12.637 --> 16:14.638
I, I never quite fit in.
Ask anyone.

16:14.639 --> 16:15.772
No, he doesn't.

16:15.773 --> 16:16.974
PASCAL:
Shut up! Shut up!

16:16.975 --> 16:19.643
Get behind the bar!
Go on.

16:19.711 --> 16:22.279
All right, Lilith,

16:22.347 --> 16:24.348
if you want to play
the waiting game,

16:24.416 --> 16:27.150
I'm prepared to play along.

16:27.218 --> 16:30.120
I give you just ten minutes
to make up your mind.

16:30.188 --> 16:35.008
If you won't leave with me then,
I start shooting.

16:35.127 --> 16:37.595
And this is the man
you wanted to marry?!

16:37.662 --> 16:40.163
Who says I wanted to marry him?

16:40.231 --> 16:43.300
Two days ago, I got a Mail-gram
saying you wanted a divorce.

16:43.301 --> 16:44.952
Correction, I sent
that Mail-gram.

16:44.953 --> 16:47.354
I thought that with you out
of the way,

16:47.422 --> 16:48.682
Lilith and I would be free

16:48.683 --> 16:50.508
to spend the rest
of our lives together.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.275
But then Lilith escaped.

16:52.310 --> 16:54.477
By the way, it was very clever
of you

16:54.545 --> 16:57.580
putting that papier-mâché bust
of yourself in your cot.

16:57.649 --> 16:59.350
I must admit,

16:59.401 --> 17:02.619
I kissed it more than once
before I got wise.

17:04.489 --> 17:07.340
You have nine minutes left.

17:07.342 --> 17:09.276
(whispers):
Hey, I got a plan. Come here.

17:09.277 --> 17:12.695
Lilith, Lilith, here's the plan.

17:12.763 --> 17:15.483
Okay, you go back
to the Eco-pod with Pascal.

17:15.584 --> 17:16.900
And then what?

17:16.917 --> 17:18.801
And then the plan's done.

17:20.771 --> 17:23.006
Don't panic.
I know Louis.

17:23.007 --> 17:26.009
He's a little upset right now,
but he's essentially harmless.

17:26.010 --> 17:29.213
He won't do anything that would
cause anyone any harm.

17:29.264 --> 17:30.614
The hell I won't!

17:30.682 --> 17:33.950
I'll shoot everyone in this bar
if I have to to get you back!

17:34.019 --> 17:37.020
CLIFF:
Listen, okay, okay.

17:37.088 --> 17:39.056
All right, all right, I got it.

17:39.191 --> 17:42.376
How about I sob uncontrollably

17:42.444 --> 17:45.679
and-and lose control
of my bodily functions?

17:45.781 --> 17:47.898
Cliff, is that a plan?

17:47.949 --> 17:50.633
No, actually,
it's more of a warning.

17:54.856 --> 17:57.891
No, no, no, I,
I've got one. Come here.

17:57.959 --> 18:00.360
I'll go up there
and I'll come on to him.

18:00.428 --> 18:03.396
I'll flirt with him,
and I'll distract him.

18:03.465 --> 18:07.233
Any other thoughts?

18:07.301 --> 18:09.736
Anyone?

18:11.289 --> 18:12.822
You're a psychiatrist.

18:12.890 --> 18:14.191
Talk to the man.

18:14.192 --> 18:16.427
You must be trained in
some kind of technique.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.929
I was afraid somebody
would bring that up.

18:18.996 --> 18:20.197
All right, all right.

18:20.265 --> 18:23.567
I do recall taking
some sort of an oath once.

18:23.634 --> 18:25.369
Good luck. Good luck.

18:27.695 --> 18:30.407
Keep your distance, Crane!

18:30.408 --> 18:32.125
Okay.

18:32.193 --> 18:34.094
I, I just want to
talk to you, Louis.

18:34.162 --> 18:36.763
Do you mind if
I call you "Louis"?

18:36.781 --> 18:39.550
Listen, Louis,
I, I've been there.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.902
I've felt the hurt.

18:41.969 --> 18:43.820
I've felt the abandonment.

18:43.888 --> 18:46.022
I've felt what it's like

18:46.091 --> 18:49.259
when a woman tears
your entire life apart.

18:49.327 --> 18:52.129
Believe me,
I've been there, my friend.

18:52.264 --> 18:56.383
Even just looking at Lilith now
brings back all the pain

18:56.384 --> 18:58.018
and the torment I've suffered
every second

18:58.019 --> 18:59.486
for the last six months.

19:01.273 --> 19:04.141
Please, put the gun down, Louis.

19:04.209 --> 19:06.176
See, I got through it.

19:06.244 --> 19:07.877
So will you.

19:07.945 --> 19:09.846
Just put the gun down.

19:09.898 --> 19:12.099
Nice speech, Crane, but get out

19:12.150 --> 19:13.717
of my way or I swear to God

19:13.718 --> 19:15.586
you're gonna be
the first one to go!

19:15.587 --> 19:17.087
Oh, I can't stand this anymore.

19:17.088 --> 19:19.424
Look, Louis, if you're going
to shoot someone, shoot me.

19:19.425 --> 19:22.225
I won't go back with you,
and you don't want me back.

19:22.293 --> 19:24.093
I'd only make you
more miserable.

19:24.129 --> 19:26.729
I can't shoot you, Lilith.

19:26.730 --> 19:28.666
Well, you're going
to have to do it, Louis.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.467
That's the only way
to end this.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.720
Give me the gun, Louis.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.772
(sobbing)

19:35.840 --> 19:39.510
I'm sorry, Lilith!

19:39.561 --> 19:43.880
Well, Sam, thanks for another
delightful evening at Cheers.

19:45.850 --> 19:48.568
We must do it again sometime.

19:48.603 --> 19:50.620
I'm, uh, sorry about this, John.

19:50.688 --> 19:53.423
Next time you come on down,
drinks are on the house.

19:53.491 --> 19:56.026
Oh, then it's all worthwhile.

20:05.002 --> 20:09.273
Boy, look at that
poor mule-yak, huh?

20:09.340 --> 20:12.543
I really pity him.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.761
It really makes you think,
though, doesn't it?

20:14.762 --> 20:17.931
Where is that fine line
between sanity and insanity?

20:17.966 --> 20:19.817
Look behind you, Clavin.

20:19.884 --> 20:22.085
You stepped over it
about a year ago.

20:24.356 --> 20:25.906
Are you all right, Lilith?

20:25.974 --> 20:28.075
Yes, I think so.

20:28.143 --> 20:29.709
Good.

20:29.778 --> 20:34.181
Frasier...

20:34.249 --> 20:37.550
do we have any chance
for reconciliation?

20:41.773 --> 20:43.807
I'm sorry, Lilith, but no.

20:43.908 --> 20:47.344
I just can't go
through this again.

20:51.483 --> 20:53.851
I understand.

20:53.918 --> 20:57.120
And I'll respect your wishes.

20:58.923 --> 21:03.159
Frasier, you know, I hadn't
realized just how deeply

21:03.227 --> 21:06.563
I'd wounded you
until I heard what you said to Louis.

21:06.631 --> 21:11.101
All I can say is
please don't hate me forever.

21:15.072 --> 21:17.758
I'll check into a hotel.

21:17.826 --> 21:22.929
Maybe we can meet
tomorrow and sort out

21:22.997 --> 21:26.884
the... (clears throat)...
divorce proceedings.

21:29.754 --> 21:32.455
I think that would be best.

21:36.393 --> 21:38.996
(high-pitched sobs)

21:43.517 --> 21:45.919
What's that sound?

21:45.970 --> 21:48.004
(sobs continue)

21:48.056 --> 21:51.624
Sounds like she's got a pretzel
stuck in her throat.

21:53.311 --> 21:55.044
As hard as it may
be to believe,

21:55.113 --> 21:59.015
that is the sound
of my wife... sobbing.

22:00.819 --> 22:03.069
(sobbing continues)

22:03.420 --> 22:06.523
Hey, say something, will you?

22:06.524 --> 22:07.825
Just make her stop.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.663
I'll handle this.

22:12.730 --> 22:16.633
Now, Lilith, I'm just
gonna say this once,

22:16.634 --> 22:17.701
so hear me.

22:17.702 --> 22:19.035
(sobbing continues)

22:19.103 --> 22:21.371
No matter how much you sob,

22:21.439 --> 22:25.476
no matter how much you plead,

22:25.543 --> 22:28.278
we are not going to Venus.

22:28.346 --> 22:31.564
Oh, Frasier!

22:31.599 --> 22:33.283
Welcome home, Lilith.

22:33.351 --> 22:34.401
Oh!

22:34.436 --> 22:36.636
Boy, that's beautiful.

22:36.704 --> 22:39.873
Start pouring, Wood.
