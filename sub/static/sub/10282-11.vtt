WEBVTT

00:03.137 --> 00:05.039
Previously on ER:

00:05.073 --> 00:06.674
I take full
responsibility

00:06.707 --> 00:08.576
for what happened
with Sanders.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.344
It won't happen again.

00:10.378 --> 00:11.445
Please, you got
to help me.

00:11.479 --> 00:12.580
I think he's dying.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.215
Hey!

00:14.248 --> 00:17.151
That man's just been told
his cancer has spread.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.519
Don't you think
he has a reason to cry?

00:18.552 --> 00:19.653
Yes.

00:19.687 --> 00:20.754
Fix my brother,
bitch,

00:20.788 --> 00:22.256
before I blow your head off.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.457
I'm telling you,
trust yourself

00:23.491 --> 00:25.459
enough to comfort.

00:25.493 --> 00:26.594
I said let's go!

00:26.627 --> 00:27.628
Please...

00:27.661 --> 00:29.463
You don't have
to do this.

00:29.497 --> 00:30.598
I said lay down.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:14.908 --> 01:16.744
He's too young to go,
and he shouldn't

01:16.777 --> 01:18.146
be listening to that
music anyway.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.713
I didn't know
you already said no.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.549
Luka, I'm trying to teach him
the value of a dollar

01:21.582 --> 01:23.251
and you go and you give him
everything he wants.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.585
It was only 50 bucks.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.487
For a concert ticket
for a ten-year-old? No.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.355
That's ridiculous.

01:27.388 --> 01:28.589
I just don't think

01:28.622 --> 01:30.658
you should be worried
about money so much.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.161
Okay, I appreciate
your generosity,

01:33.161 --> 01:34.862
but I'm not going to let you
start paying for everything.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.597
But you don't have to pay
exactly half the rent

01:36.630 --> 01:38.766
and half the bills
every month-- it's ridiculous.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.601
I managed to support me and Alex
for 10 years all on my own.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.236
I think I can
handle it.

01:42.270 --> 01:43.904
You know,
this isn't about money at all.

01:43.937 --> 01:47.275
You're worried about losing
your independence or something.

01:47.308 --> 01:48.776
And about my role
in Alex's life.

01:48.809 --> 01:52.246
What, you're worried about
losing control over him?

01:52.280 --> 01:53.681
You know what,
you always do this?

01:53.714 --> 01:55.249
Do what?
This!

01:55.283 --> 01:57.218
Telling me
what I'm really mad about.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.852
Most of the time you don't know
what you're really mad about.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.427
Sam, this isn't our stop.

02:15.603 --> 02:19.373
Hey. Sleep okay?

02:19.407 --> 02:20.541
Yeah.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.410
Better than
the night before?

02:25.213 --> 02:27.881
You want to eat anything
before you smoke?

02:27.915 --> 02:29.483
No.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.286
But thanks.

02:34.688 --> 02:37.225
I can make French toast.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.559
Aren't you on your way out?

02:38.592 --> 02:40.361
I have time.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.698
Want anything
to drink?

02:44.732 --> 02:45.699
I bought groceries
yesterday.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.235
We've got milk,
juice...

02:47.235 --> 02:50.271
No, thanks. Were you
vacuuming last night?

02:50.304 --> 02:51.872
I'm sorry.
Did I keep you up?

02:51.905 --> 02:53.907
No. I just...

02:53.941 --> 02:56.744
No, that was very
nice of you.

02:59.247 --> 03:01.715
Your, uh, shift
starts at 2:00, right?

03:01.749 --> 03:02.983
You ready
to go back?

03:03.016 --> 03:05.919
Well, can't keep
hanging around here.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.489
I got to get
going again.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.892
Everyone's been
asking how you are.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.766
So, you sure
you're okay?

03:18.799 --> 03:21.502
What I really need
is a little space.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.870
Okay.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.705
I'm sorry, I just...
No, you're right.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.607
I should find my own place.
I'll start looking today.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.742
You don't have to rush.
No, really.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.311
See you at work.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.339
They're not closing
the E.R., are they?

04:31.339 --> 04:33.774
I heard the county health
system's run out of money.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.343
They say that
every year

04:35.343 --> 04:36.644
so that the government
will bail us out.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.346
Well, they're not
meeting on the match.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.913
No way,
the applications
aren't even in.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.882
I know, Ray, that's why
I said it's not the match.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.484
PRATT:
It's an attendings' meeting,
they do this every month.

04:43.517 --> 04:44.785
NEELA:
But they usually
meet upstairs.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.454
Come on, enough with
the paranoia, people.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.688
Let's get
back to work.

04:47.721 --> 04:48.689
What's going on?

04:48.722 --> 04:49.690
Attendings are meeting.

04:49.723 --> 04:52.360
W-Why? Why here?
Why now?

04:52.360 --> 04:53.694
PRATT:
I don't know.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.363
Maybe they're thinking
of cutting a resident.

04:55.363 --> 04:57.931
No. You think
that's what this is?

04:57.965 --> 05:00.033
I don't know, but
whatever it is,

05:00.067 --> 05:01.735
it can't be good.

05:01.769 --> 05:02.570
PRATT:
Uh-oh.

05:02.603 --> 05:03.837
Go! Go! Go! Go!

05:03.871 --> 05:05.373
LEWIS:
What color are
you painting

05:05.406 --> 05:06.374
the conference
room?
Lime green.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.508
Why?

05:07.541 --> 05:08.642
Because it's
my favorite color.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.579
Okay, the attendings' note.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.847
It's not enough
just to co-sign the chart,

05:13.881 --> 05:15.516
you have to write
your own brief history,

05:15.549 --> 05:16.817
medical assessment
and plan.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.051
On every patient?

05:18.085 --> 05:19.387
It's the only way
we'll get paid.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.589
( Carter yawns )

05:21.622 --> 05:23.391
Sorry,
very long shift.

05:23.391 --> 05:26.494
( yawning ):
Yawning's contagious.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.396
Cosmo's teething,
I was up all night.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.130
I'm exhausted...

05:30.163 --> 05:31.899
and we're down two nurses--
anything else?

05:31.932 --> 05:34.635
If we don't get our patient
satisfaction scores up,

05:34.668 --> 05:36.737
we can't start
pursuing HMO contracts.

05:36.770 --> 05:37.905
Okay, who's low?

05:37.938 --> 05:39.807
Ray, Neela, Morris.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.809
Abby's the only one
with a decent score.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.444
Even Pratt's on the low end.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.145
I think Pratt's okay
with patients,

05:45.178 --> 05:46.947
it's the other doctor's
he has a problem with.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.417
Need the room for a brachial
artery laceration,

05:49.450 --> 05:50.784
ten minutes out.

05:50.818 --> 05:53.954
And Neela brings up the rear
with a score of 2.21.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.789
If we want to make
our patients happier,

05:55.823 --> 05:58.692
we need to teach our residents
to connect with them better.

05:58.726 --> 05:59.960
To communicate,
to listen...

05:59.993 --> 06:01.662
What are you,
the Croatian Dr. Phil?

06:01.695 --> 06:03.130
They can't even communicate
with each other.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.865
Have you ever seen Neela
and Pratt work together?

06:04.898 --> 06:06.534
Ray and Morris?

06:06.567 --> 06:07.901
But we can teach them
to make eye contact,

06:07.935 --> 06:09.670
to introduce themselves,
you know?

06:09.703 --> 06:11.905
Act like normal human beings
in front of the patients.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.040
But that
would be changing

06:13.073 --> 06:14.708
their basic personality
structure,

06:14.742 --> 06:15.743
which would be
a great strategy

06:15.776 --> 06:16.977
if we could turn back time

06:17.010 --> 06:18.446
and make their parents
love them more.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.180
Med schools churn
out scientists.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.615
It's up to us to turn
them into physicians.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.651
Try it.
They can't do any worse.

06:23.684 --> 06:24.985
( yawns )

06:25.018 --> 06:27.788
I'm going to get coffee.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.658
I'm going home.

06:30.691 --> 06:31.692
MAN:
How long you been waiting?

06:31.725 --> 06:32.993
'Bout six hours.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.695
Six hours?

06:34.728 --> 06:36.497
A little longer, my friend,

06:36.530 --> 06:38.732
and you're looking at
a very big cash settlement.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.468
Here, take one of my cards.

06:40.468 --> 06:41.469
Out of my way!

06:41.502 --> 06:42.069
Give one to your buddy here.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.537
Out of my way.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.038
I look forward to
hearing from you.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.807
My first job was working
in an orange juice factory...

06:46.840 --> 06:48.476
Hey, Amy, could you
sit down please?

06:48.509 --> 06:50.478
...but I got canned--
couldn't concentrate.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.546
I'd rather stand.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.047
The seats are too small for her.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.483
Oh, shut up, Cullum.

06:56.617 --> 06:59.487
I'll get you
in soon, okay?

07:00.521 --> 07:01.722
Pratt, knee contusion,

07:01.755 --> 07:03.524
slipped at work,
can't bear weight.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.693
Well, I've got a hot MI,
so it's gonna have to wait.

07:05.726 --> 07:08.095
I didn't say it can't wait,
I said can't bear weight.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.563
As in stand up.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.699
I'll get to it
when I get to it.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.634
Little plan to help
the residents communicate,

07:13.667 --> 07:14.935
you might want
to start with Pratt.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.804
Okay, just tell
me the truth.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.707
How many Vicodin will it take
for you to just go away, huh?!

07:19.740 --> 07:20.908
Or Morris.
'Cause I'll write it down.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.743
I'm doomed. Morris!

07:22.776 --> 07:25.713
Relax and come talk
to me when you're done.

07:25.746 --> 07:26.680
Hi.

07:26.714 --> 07:27.515
Hi.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.016
Going home?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.884
Yeah, I'm going to go home
and sleep off my shift,

07:30.918 --> 07:32.720
and come back in 12
hours and pick you up.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.087
Oh, really?

07:34.121 --> 07:35.589
Puccini's can take
us tonight at 9:00.

07:35.623 --> 07:36.924
For me it'll
be breakfast,

07:36.957 --> 07:38.191
for you it'll be
whatever you want.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.027
Fantastic-- I'm craving
a pound of pasta

07:40.060 --> 07:42.996
and some oily garlic bread.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.732
She's carbo-loading
for a marathon.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.233
Enjoy your honeymoon.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.035
I'm going to be spending
the night fighting with Sam.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.137
Okay, have fun
with that.

07:50.170 --> 07:53.674
Dr. Kovac, can you get
gastritis after 16 ibuprofen?

07:53.707 --> 07:56.176
Uh, why's your patient
taking that much medicine?

07:56.209 --> 07:57.778
Is he depressed?

07:57.811 --> 07:59.246
I was about to check.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.614
There you go.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.282
Neela, Amy Packer,

08:02.315 --> 08:04.184
an obese 15-year-old
with forehead lac.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.185
Her mother's
on her way in.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.754
What happened?

08:06.787 --> 08:07.988
Brother hit her over
the head with a lamp.

08:09.590 --> 08:10.624
SAM:
Hi, Amy.

08:10.658 --> 08:11.625
This is Dr. Rasgotra.

08:11.659 --> 08:12.292
Hi.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.828
Hi. Um, this is Cullum.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.830
Um, I can't get up.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.933
Too fat to get up.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.182
Ow.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.018
Oh, my goodness, that was quite

08:38.051 --> 08:39.019
the fall,
young lady.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.988
Thank you.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.923
Can you believe it?
Here you go.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.926
All this ice and not
a speck of salt to be seen.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.295
I mean, I think the hospital
is completely negligent

08:48.328 --> 08:50.163
and responsible for your
injury in this situation.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.633
Oh, no, I don't
have an injury.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.201
You're going
to feel okay probably

08:54.234 --> 08:57.270
for the first 24 hours,
and then the pain develops.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.607
You could be looking at
long-term disability

08:59.640 --> 09:03.043
from, uh, for example,
lumbar myofascial strain

09:03.076 --> 09:06.213
or a disk herniation
syndrome with radiculopathy.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.748
It's just a bruise.

09:07.781 --> 09:10.083
I think an MRI
is indicated, definitely.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.151
Are you a doctor?

09:11.184 --> 09:12.953
Uh, no. Attorney.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.188
Herb Spivak,
attorney at law.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.157
My, uh, card.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.992
JERRY:
Dr. Lewis,
OIG on line two

09:19.026 --> 09:20.628
claiming we transferred
an unstable patient.

09:20.628 --> 09:21.729
You're a doctor, huh?

09:21.762 --> 09:22.796
Yeah.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.064
Well, let me
tell you something.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.666
You never know
when you're going to need

09:25.699 --> 09:27.067
a little more protection.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.937
These hospital bigwigs
will let you hang out to dry.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.639
I guarantee you that,
if you ever get sued.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.741
If you solicit any more patients
in my ambulance bay

09:33.774 --> 09:35.242
I will have you
forcibly removed.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.645
How 'bout a free pen?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.782
Follow
my finger, um...

09:41.815 --> 09:43.183
Amy.
Thank you.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.018
Hi, I'm Dr. Kovac.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.020
Neela, present to me
when you're done here.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.722
Oh, okay. Am I in some
sort of trouble?

09:48.756 --> 09:51.224
No, no. Just keep going.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.292
PRATT:
It's Mr. Meacham, right?

09:52.325 --> 09:53.661
The one and only.

09:53.661 --> 09:54.895
Tell me about
your knee pain.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.029
Did you fall
or have an injury?

09:56.063 --> 09:57.698
I was moving
boxes at work.

09:57.731 --> 09:58.932
Where do you work?

09:58.966 --> 10:00.668
Well, I used to work
as a lumberjack,

10:00.701 --> 10:03.036
but I couldn't hack it
so they gave me the ax.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.138
Is it worse
when you walk?

10:05.172 --> 10:07.107
Can I help you
with something, Dr. Kovac?

10:07.140 --> 10:08.942
Just observing.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.711
You have pain
in any other joints?

10:10.744 --> 10:12.012
Hey, Sam, can you get

10:12.045 --> 10:13.714
a postural vitals
for me in Exam Two?

10:13.747 --> 10:14.982
I'm getting slammed.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.383
I'm setting Neela up
for suturing,

10:16.416 --> 10:18.986
I got a Foley, an NG,
two I.V.s to start

10:19.019 --> 10:21.021
and a five-page patient
transfer summary.

10:23.023 --> 10:26.259
I got your tray.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.695
Hey, Amy,
I talked to your mom,

10:27.728 --> 10:28.696
she's on her way in
from work.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.063
Oh, my foster mom.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.999
He's her real son.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.667
How long have you
been with them?

10:33.701 --> 10:35.002
Since last March. Ow!

10:35.035 --> 10:35.903
Sorry.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.938
Uh, that was lidocaine

10:37.971 --> 10:38.906
to numb up your cut.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.208
Die! Ha!

10:41.241 --> 10:43.076
I hope he's
referring to his game.

10:43.110 --> 10:47.781
Cullum needs his meds adjusted,
that's why he has tantrums.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.750
Is that what happened,
he lost his temper?

10:49.783 --> 10:50.751
Kinda.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.085
What meds is he on?

10:52.119 --> 10:54.021
Adderall and Depakote for ADHD

10:54.054 --> 10:55.055
and ODD.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.993
I'll be, uh, back
to sew you up.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.898
Does it seem like every
10-year-old boy we see nowadays

11:04.932 --> 11:06.133
has ADHD?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.101
ADHD, a Game Boy
and an iPod.

11:08.135 --> 11:10.838
Foster kid, head injury,
unsupervised home.

11:10.871 --> 11:11.939
We should call
social work.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.741
I think Wendall's on.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.743
Look, I know how
to do an H&P.

11:15.776 --> 11:16.744
Excuse me, Dr. Kovac?

11:16.777 --> 11:18.178
Hold on.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.914
How long did you let him talk
before interrupting him?

11:20.948 --> 11:22.182
20, 30 seconds.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.351
Four.
What color were his eyes?

11:24.384 --> 11:26.153
I don't know, we
weren't on a date.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.454
You didn't make
eye contact.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.455
Did you listen
to his heart?

11:28.488 --> 11:29.823
The guy had
a twisted knee.

11:29.857 --> 11:30.991
Doesn't matter
what he has.

11:31.024 --> 11:31.892
You need to listen
to his heart

11:31.925 --> 11:33.460
to show that you care

11:33.493 --> 11:35.195
and that you're paying
attention to every detail.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.764
I don't have time
to put on a show.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.231
It takes one minute and
it can make a difference

11:38.265 --> 11:39.499
between your patient

11:39.532 --> 11:41.301
feeling taken care of
and feeling ignored.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.170
Look, we've got patients

11:43.203 --> 11:45.138
that have been waiting
over nine hours out there.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.941
Believe me, they
already feel ignored.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.780
You ready to present?

11:52.780 --> 11:55.816
I think I need
to redo my exam.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.317
Listen, it's about
connecting better.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.819
If your patients
trusts you,

11:58.852 --> 12:00.187
she'll heal faster.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.288
That's what all the
studies say, okay?

12:01.321 --> 12:02.790
Okay.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.159
Wow, I find it
really distracting

12:06.193 --> 12:07.427
working with somebody
so good-looking.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.262
Who? Dr. Kovac?

12:09.296 --> 12:10.998
Oh, come on.
Don't pretend
he's not hot.

12:11.031 --> 12:11.899
I don't know.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.200
You just get used to it.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.534
Yeah, but I mean,
he's gorgeous.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.836
Who's gorgeous?

12:15.869 --> 12:17.370
MAN:
Got a John Doe.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.807
Looks about 16,
multiple GSWs
to the chest.

12:19.840 --> 12:20.473
NEELA:
Any vitals in the field?

12:20.507 --> 12:21.408
Nothing.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.811
Luka, tier one, no BP.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.378
Never had a rhythm,
fixed and dilated.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.513
You want to call it?

12:26.546 --> 12:27.948
Let's see what we can do.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.983
NEELA:
Should we get some 0-neg?

12:30.017 --> 12:31.184
Am I missing something?

12:31.218 --> 12:33.220
No, let's stick
with saline for now.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.554
I thought asystole
in the field

12:34.587 --> 12:36.123
meant zero-percent survival.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.390
Sam, start
compressions.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.826
What, you want labs, too?

12:38.859 --> 12:40.260
No, just check a crit.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.195
Oh, this is like some sort
of a practice thing.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.396
Apparently.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.065
JANE:
Oh, can I do a chest tube?

12:45.098 --> 12:46.900
No, Neela's going to
do a saphenous cutdown.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.068
She is?
I am?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.502
Oh, cool.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.204
Okay, let's prep
and drape the ankle.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.539
10 blade to Neela.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.912
Okay, now make your incision
from the anterior tibia

12:58.946 --> 12:59.947
to the medial malleolus.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.316
You a doctor?

13:03.350 --> 13:05.218
I think I'm having an aneurysm.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.120
Sir, please wait back inside
for a doctor to get to you.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.421
Pratt, you got a sec?

13:08.455 --> 13:10.123
I could be having
a stroke right now!

13:10.157 --> 13:11.424
It's probably
just a tension
headache.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.093
You really think
they might cut
a resident?

13:13.126 --> 13:14.394
I'm gonna sue your ass
if I end up paralyzed.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.863
Why are you
following me?

13:15.896 --> 13:17.030
I'm not following you,
dumbbell.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.431
Gentlemen, please!
I'm serious.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.967
My attorney's office
is right over there.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.601
SPIVAK:
Did a doctor
screw you up?
What?

13:21.634 --> 13:28.608
Come visit the Mobile Law Office
of Herb W. Spivak.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.878
He's had two rounds
of epi and atropine.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.345
Holding compressions.

13:32.379 --> 13:33.914
One more tie on
the distal segment.

13:33.947 --> 13:34.948
Okay.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.250
Asystole.
How much longer?

13:37.284 --> 13:40.220
Until the third
liter's in.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.289
Sam, resume
compressions.

13:48.361 --> 13:51.999
Can you check for
the femoral pulse?

13:52.032 --> 13:53.033
Can't quite get one.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.902
Because he bled out.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.037
Third liter's in.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.572
KOVAC:
No pulse.
Okay, that's it.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.108
Time of death, 9:52.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.043
Thanks for showing me.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.145
Yeah. Write up your
note. I'll co-sign.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.380
Any identifying marks?

14:07.414 --> 14:08.916
Brand-new sneakers, blue.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.117
Wonder what he was thinking

14:10.150 --> 14:12.019
when he put those on
this morning.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.090
What?

14:17.124 --> 14:18.458
If it'd just been
you and me,

14:18.491 --> 14:19.392
you would've pronounced him
dead in the hall.

14:19.426 --> 14:20.360
He was hypovolemic.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.594
He never had a pulse.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.030
There was a chance

14:23.063 --> 14:24.531
he might respond
to a fluid bolus.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.933
If you were really serious,

14:25.933 --> 14:28.068
you would have ordered
the 0-neg.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.103
Someday they might find
themselves in the place

14:30.137 --> 14:32.005
with no rapid infuser
or a central line kit,

14:32.039 --> 14:33.473
and if they know how
to do a cutdown,

14:33.506 --> 14:34.574
they could save a life.

14:34.607 --> 14:35.675
You know, I can't afford

14:35.708 --> 14:37.177
to waste my time
on teaching cases

14:37.210 --> 14:38.345
when there's
real work to do.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.212
This is what we do.

14:39.246 --> 14:40.580
We train doctors.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.482
And sometimes that means
running through codes

14:42.515 --> 14:44.284
so residents can learn
procedures.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.053
It's a-it's a teaching hospital.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.955
Yeah, it's also a real hospital,

14:47.955 --> 14:49.556
with live patients
who didn't get antibiotics

14:49.589 --> 14:50.991
and insulin 'cause I was in here

14:51.024 --> 14:52.425
doing compressions
for 30 minutes!

14:52.459 --> 14:54.227
Okay, so you did some
extra compressions.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.595
What are you really mad about?

14:58.198 --> 14:59.699
Are you in all seriousness
telling me

14:59.732 --> 15:01.434
for the second time today

15:01.468 --> 15:04.537
that I am not mad
about what I'm really mad about?

15:04.571 --> 15:07.540
I have no idea
what you just said.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.278
Forget it.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.219
$900 for a studio
in Andersonville?

15:19.252 --> 15:20.487
What happened,
Abby kick you out?

15:20.520 --> 15:22.522
No... yes.

15:22.555 --> 15:23.623
When's she coming in?

15:23.656 --> 15:25.458
Her shift starts
at 2:00.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.294
I-I've missed her.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.463
What? I-I have.

15:30.497 --> 15:33.200
Well, I just got a two-bedroom
sublet on North and Oakley

15:33.233 --> 15:34.601
for just a thousand a month.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.469
Wicker Park.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.605
Yeah, but my roommate
just flaked out on me, so...

15:38.638 --> 15:40.640
Back in rehab, huh?

15:40.673 --> 15:43.110
You wouldn't happen
to be interested in, um...

15:43.143 --> 15:45.178
You mean, you and me?

15:45.212 --> 15:46.546
500's better than a grand.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.448
Thanks, I'll
think about it.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.055
MORRIS:
Hey, isn't that
our local shyster?

15:56.456 --> 15:57.290
Damn.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.691
No, no. Allow me.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.094
Go for it, Archie.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.665
Hi. I'm looking
for a Dr. Rasgo...

16:05.698 --> 16:07.667
Rasgotra. That's me.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.136
Hi. I'm Kitty Peyser,
I'm Amy's foster mom.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.403
Is she okay?

16:10.437 --> 16:11.671
She's fine.
She just needs some stitches

16:11.704 --> 16:13.440
to the forehead
and a tetanus shot.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.674
I heard they got
into a fight.

16:14.707 --> 16:15.775
Cullum's not a bad kid,

16:15.808 --> 16:16.776
he just needs
his meds adjusted.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.511
He's in the family room.

16:18.545 --> 16:19.646
Perhaps you'd like to talk
to our social worker?

16:19.679 --> 16:21.381
No. I just want
to see my daughter.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.216
I should tell you I had
to notify social work,

16:23.250 --> 16:25.052
and they'll probably
be contacting the DCFS.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.486
What?

16:26.519 --> 16:28.321
When foster children come in
with suspicious injuries...

16:28.355 --> 16:29.256
No, no, no.
Come on.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.423
Hey, kids fight.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.225
It's a standard
situation.

16:32.259 --> 16:33.193
There is no situation.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.361
Mrs. Peyser...

16:34.394 --> 16:35.795
Look, look,
don't do this to us.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.130
We love Amy.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.166
They'll take her away.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.069
Hi.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.605
OLBES:
Multiple GSWs.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.374
Gang shoot-out on the corner
of 51st and King.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.476
Tachy at 138, B.P. 85 palp.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.543
I'll take the airway.

16:50.577 --> 16:51.611
What do you got?

16:51.644 --> 16:52.812
Three gunshots
to the abdomen.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.647
Run it, Pratt.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.149
No breath sounds
on the left.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.318
Morris, chest tube.
Jane, subclavian.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.386
Ray, stop staring
at the monitor

16:59.419 --> 17:00.653
and concentrate
on your patient.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.122
JANE:
I've never done
a subclavian.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.357
Hey, it's time
to buck up, Calamity Jane.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.358
Central line kit.
Did you get rid of Herb yet?

17:06.393 --> 17:07.727
He says he has a client
at the hospital

17:07.760 --> 17:09.596
revising her will.

17:09.628 --> 17:11.164
He is wily, that one.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.267
Stay in the mid-line, Ray.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.301
I got it.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.805
Does he need
atropine or epi?

17:18.838 --> 17:21.374
No, he needs oxygen.
The tube's not in.

17:21.407 --> 17:25.278
You have to see it go
through the cords every time.

17:25.311 --> 17:26.179
Gimme the blade.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.114
Let me try again.

17:27.146 --> 17:28.848
Maybe next time. Tube.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.617
Pratt, why don't you
try teaching?

17:30.650 --> 17:32.719
Oh, okay. You did it wrong.
Watch me.

17:34.854 --> 17:37.324
Call surgery.
This guy needs an ex-lap.

17:37.357 --> 17:38.825
And... I'm in.

17:38.858 --> 17:41.328
See?
It's just that simple.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.629
Thank you, Greg.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.297
Any time, Ray.

17:44.331 --> 17:45.832
Am I gonna have a scar?

17:45.865 --> 17:47.700
Just a little line.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.469
Honey, we'll take you
to Darlene's salon tomorrow.

17:49.502 --> 17:50.837
We'll get you bangs.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.339
That'd be nice.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.473
You'll have to keep
the wound dry

17:53.506 --> 17:54.474
until the sutures come out

17:54.507 --> 17:56.409
so no baths and no swimming.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.445
I should go check on Cullum.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.547
Mary, can you take Mrs. Peyser
to the family room?

18:00.580 --> 18:01.448
Sure.

18:01.481 --> 18:02.715
Don't worry, Amy.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.284
Everything's going to be fine.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.598
Okay, so Neosporin
twice a day, and come back

18:18.631 --> 18:21.368
if it's red, painful
or draining fluid.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.174
Does your cut hurt?

18:34.647 --> 18:36.449
What's wrong?

18:36.483 --> 18:38.185
( voice breaking ):
I know what's gonna happen.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.886
Once you call in social work...

18:39.919 --> 18:41.454
Amy, don't get ahead
of yourself.

18:41.488 --> 18:42.622
I can't leave them.

18:42.655 --> 18:43.856
They need me.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.758
( sighs )

18:45.792 --> 18:47.860
I give Cullum his pills
every morning,

18:47.894 --> 18:49.896
and I get him ready for school.

18:49.929 --> 18:52.665
That's a lot of responsibility
for a girl your age.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.301
This is the only home

18:54.334 --> 18:56.269
where I haven't been beaten up
or ignored.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.405
Kitty loves me, she needs me.

18:58.438 --> 19:01.308
My whole life--
I've never felt that before.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.849
( beeping )

19:09.882 --> 19:11.484
Sam.
Yeah?

19:11.518 --> 19:13.853
Did you already
call social work
on Amy Packer?

19:13.886 --> 19:15.922
Uh, yeah.
Wendall will be down soon.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.560
What is that?

19:20.593 --> 19:22.595
( laughing ):
It's still caffeine.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.564
Can you call Wendall back
and tell her not to bother?

19:24.597 --> 19:25.298
Why?

19:25.332 --> 19:26.533
I was too quick.

19:26.566 --> 19:27.834
I should have waited
to talk to the family.

19:27.867 --> 19:28.935
She's a foster kid.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.370
We always call
social work.

19:36.409 --> 19:37.444
Penny, what are you doing?

19:37.477 --> 19:38.478
Stabbing me to death.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.946
I think he's
dehydrated.

19:39.979 --> 19:42.915
Ow! Do I look
like a pin cushion to you?

19:42.949 --> 19:44.317
He's my patient.

19:44.351 --> 19:45.685
Why are you torturing
my patient?

19:45.718 --> 19:47.320
Jane said Dr. Kovac
told her you needed

19:47.354 --> 19:49.556
some help today.

19:49.589 --> 19:50.823
Sat's 79.
Barely any pulse.
( alarms )

19:50.857 --> 19:52.392
All right, get out
of the way, let me do it.

19:52.425 --> 19:53.993
You can practice later
on a dummy.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.528
I can't get the
tube into the
pleural space.

19:55.562 --> 19:56.463
Use a twisting motion.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.297
Systolic's
only 60.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.731
Cycle the
dynamap.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.333
Is your incision
big enough?
I don't know.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.335
Morris, you've done
a chest tube before, right?

20:02.369 --> 20:03.336
Pratt.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.471
PEA, lost
the pulse.

20:04.504 --> 20:05.472
Give me
the tube.
No, I got it.

20:05.505 --> 20:06.673
Move out of the way!

20:06.706 --> 20:07.940
Hey, Pratt, you need
to manage your team.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.242
I'm trying. I
don't know how

20:09.276 --> 20:10.510
to explain this stuff
any better.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.578
Bradying down to 50.

20:11.611 --> 20:12.712
Amp of epi.

20:12.745 --> 20:13.813
All you do is
criticize them

20:13.846 --> 20:15.448
and make
them nervous.

20:15.482 --> 20:17.250
What do you think it is
that you're doing to me?

20:17.284 --> 20:18.985
This kid does not
have time for them
to learn on the job.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.353
Um, hello, we
can hear you.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.854
Yeah, we're standing
right here.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.291
He's pulseless.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.458
Check it again.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.429
Good carotid.

20:29.462 --> 20:30.597
Tension pneumo.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.432
It's a common cause of PEA.

20:32.465 --> 20:33.800
Sats are rising.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.902
So, uh, do you mind
if I ask our residents

20:35.935 --> 20:37.770
to roll him up to the O.R.,
or do you think

20:37.804 --> 20:39.238
that that would hurt
their feelings?

20:43.576 --> 20:45.011
What was that
all about?

20:45.044 --> 20:47.580
That was an intubation,
a chest tube and a central line

20:47.614 --> 20:48.948
in under 15 minutes.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.384
The point is not to
do it all yourself.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.686
Just because you all had
a group hug this morning,

20:53.720 --> 20:55.988
do I have to listen to this
touchy-feely crap all day?

20:56.022 --> 20:57.624
Yeah.

20:57.657 --> 20:58.991
I'm not an intern, okay?

20:59.025 --> 21:00.493
So, stop acting like one.

21:00.527 --> 21:01.794
You have people
under you now.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.029
You are responsible
for teaching them.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.664
So, the your
choice is yours.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.666
Are you going to build their
confidence or destroy it?

21:06.699 --> 21:09.536
Well, if the choice is between
building up their self-esteem

21:09.569 --> 21:12.472
and saving my patient, I'm gonna
have to go with my patient.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.840
Every time.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.342
( sighs )

21:25.952 --> 21:27.620
WENDALL:
I don't know.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.522
They were unsupervised,
the mother seems overwhelmed,

21:29.556 --> 21:31.358
the brother
has behavioral problems...

21:31.358 --> 21:32.425
This is her fifth home.

21:32.459 --> 21:33.960
It's not a perfect family,

21:33.993 --> 21:36.563
but she says it's the
best she's ever had.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.565
Well, I haven't spoken
to their caseworker yet.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.700
The safest thing to do is
to pull her from the home.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.369
But she's happy there,
and there's no guarantee

21:42.369 --> 21:43.736
things are going to be
better anywhere else.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.572
You guys talking about
that foster kid?

21:47.039 --> 21:48.441
If they're happy together

21:48.475 --> 21:49.842
and the family
seems to be working...?

21:49.876 --> 21:51.010
( sighs )

21:51.043 --> 21:52.845
If the mom agrees to
parenting classes,

21:52.879 --> 21:53.946
I'll consider
reevaluating her...

21:53.980 --> 21:55.382
JERRY:
Neela,

21:55.415 --> 21:56.949
some landlord for you
on line two.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.117
I'll take it in Admit.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.953
She'll do whatever you need.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.756
I find hospital conditions
absolutely woeful.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.925
Are you overworked
and underpaid?

22:05.958 --> 22:07.126
I'm a nurse.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.995
You can't be back here, get out.

22:09.028 --> 22:10.863
No, you can't kick me out,
I'm a patient.

22:10.897 --> 22:11.964
What?

22:11.998 --> 22:13.099
That's right. ( coughs )

22:13.132 --> 22:14.501
Very bad sore throat.

22:14.534 --> 22:15.502
Sore throat?
I signed in.

22:15.535 --> 22:16.669
Yeah.

22:16.703 --> 22:17.904
I know you guys
are backed up,

22:17.937 --> 22:19.406
so don't worry,
I'll wait.

22:19.439 --> 22:20.973
Just take all
the time you need.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.742
I'm going to
fetch me a lozenge.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.812
Haldol and
hard restraints.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.013
Huh?

22:27.046 --> 22:28.815
We could treat him
like a psych patient

22:28.848 --> 22:30.149
with delusions
of being a lawyer.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.951
Abby?
Abby.

22:31.984 --> 22:32.952
Hi.

22:32.985 --> 22:33.986
Hi.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.655
Um, are you okay?

22:35.688 --> 22:36.689
Yeah, I'm okay.

22:36.723 --> 22:37.990
Good to see you.
You, too.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.426
Oh, my God, Abby.

22:39.459 --> 22:40.427
Did you get my card?

22:40.460 --> 22:41.461
Yeah, thank you.

22:41.494 --> 22:42.829
I prayed for you.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.163
RASGOTRA:
No windows at all?

22:44.196 --> 22:46.633
Shared bathroom?
Is that even legal here?

22:46.666 --> 22:48.167
Abby finally
kicked her out?

22:48.200 --> 22:50.770
Well, how much a month?

22:52.038 --> 22:54.974
It's ugly out there.

22:55.007 --> 22:58.044
You usually do
early shifts, right?

22:58.077 --> 23:00.847
So you can go for gigs
with your band?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.515
Yeah. Yeah, and if you
stick to your late shifts

23:02.549 --> 23:03.850
or your overnights...

23:03.883 --> 23:06.486
Weeks could go by,
we might never see each other.

23:06.519 --> 23:07.954
Months, even.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.458
Welcome, roomie.

23:14.627 --> 23:15.928
God, I'm going to regret this.

23:19.198 --> 23:20.967
Excuse me, please.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.969
Excuse me, I need
to see my grandson.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.036
What's his name?

23:24.070 --> 23:25.171
Michael. Michael Barnes.

23:25.204 --> 23:27.807
His friend said
he got shot.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.075
I don't see the name.

23:29.108 --> 23:32.745
He's 16,
he was wearing jeans,

23:32.779 --> 23:34.714
a gray T-shirt
and sneakers.

23:34.747 --> 23:35.815
Blue sneakers?

23:35.848 --> 23:38.117
Yes, yes, you saw him?

23:38.150 --> 23:39.519
There was a patient
who came in earlier

23:39.552 --> 23:40.720
matching that description

23:40.753 --> 23:41.888
Is he okay?

23:41.921 --> 23:43.189
If you'd just like
to take a seat

23:43.222 --> 23:45.024
I can get the
attending for you.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.192
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.193
Did something happen?
Ma'am...

23:47.226 --> 23:48.828
Is he dead?

23:48.861 --> 23:50.196
I can't give you more
information until...

23:50.229 --> 23:51.531
Is he okay?

23:51.564 --> 23:52.665
Why can't you
just tell me that?

23:52.699 --> 23:53.900
Ma'am, please calm down.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.535
Where is he?
I need to see him.

23:55.568 --> 23:56.669
If you'd like
to take a seat...

23:56.703 --> 23:57.837
Where's my grandson?

23:57.870 --> 23:59.138
We can't confirm
anything...

23:59.171 --> 24:01.240
His name is Michael Barnes.
Michael!

24:01.273 --> 24:03.876
We can't confirm anything
until the body's been ID'ed.

24:05.645 --> 24:06.779
The body?

24:08.815 --> 24:10.650
Oh, God.

24:12.819 --> 24:13.853
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean...

24:13.886 --> 24:16.523
( cries )

24:16.523 --> 24:19.125
Ma'am, if you'd
just let me go and
get the attending...

24:19.158 --> 24:21.528
( cries ):
No!
Ma'am, if you'd just
like to take a seat.

24:21.561 --> 24:23.095
I'm sure
the attending can...
( crying )

24:23.129 --> 24:25.798
Oh...! My God!

24:25.832 --> 24:27.967
( crying ):
God...!

24:28.000 --> 24:30.169
Michael!

24:34.206 --> 24:35.608
Where's the grandmother now?

24:35.642 --> 24:36.843
Crying it out
in the family room.

24:36.876 --> 24:38.545
I guess Neela still needs
to work a little

24:38.578 --> 24:39.812
on her death notification.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.581
A little?
Grandma's traumatized.

24:41.614 --> 24:42.982
I can't believe we didn't
have to sedate her.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.017
You cannot teach
basic people skills.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.053
You're either born
knowing how to relate
to people, or you're not.

24:47.086 --> 24:48.655
Croissant?
I'll go talk
to her.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.189
You realize you're
just encouraging him.

24:50.222 --> 24:51.858
Just because he's a shark

24:51.891 --> 24:53.125
doesn't mean we can't
eat his pastries.

24:55.227 --> 24:56.929
Who's on call for
general surgery tonight?

24:56.963 --> 24:58.665
Uh... Tsung.

24:58.698 --> 25:01.568
I have to track down
an abdominal series
from radiology.

25:01.601 --> 25:02.935
And I have a puking lady

25:02.969 --> 25:05.204
that had a dystonic reaction
to phenothiazines.

25:05.237 --> 25:06.072
Zofran?

25:06.105 --> 25:07.940
Yeah, right.

25:07.974 --> 25:08.908
So how are you doing?

25:08.941 --> 25:10.777
Good.
Really?

25:10.810 --> 25:12.244
Mm-hmm.
Never better.

25:12.278 --> 25:13.746
Really?

25:13.780 --> 25:15.147
Yes. Yes.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.616
Yes.

25:16.649 --> 25:18.017
I've processed all
my feelings of anger,

25:18.050 --> 25:20.252
shame and guilt in
an emotionally safe environment.

25:20.286 --> 25:22.021
I've addressed the urge
to "use" alcohol.

25:22.054 --> 25:24.123
Oh, and I've consulted both
a shaman and a guru.

25:24.156 --> 25:25.592
So, really, I'm all good.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.994
That was Wendall,
our social worker.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.663
She's just getting
a little more information
from your foster mom.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.632
She's not going
to take me away?
No.

25:32.665 --> 25:34.634
Your foster mom's going
to take some classes

25:34.667 --> 25:36.969
and you and Cullum
are going to start
an after-school program

25:37.003 --> 25:38.871
so you can all
go home together.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.740
Oh, thank you!

25:40.773 --> 25:42.775
Thank you, thank you.

25:46.879 --> 25:49.616
Mary, can you take Amy up
to the seventh floor, please?

25:49.616 --> 25:50.683
Sure.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.151
They'll be waiting for you.

26:00.159 --> 26:01.961
So you convinced
social work, huh?

26:01.994 --> 26:03.696
Seems so.

26:03.730 --> 26:04.964
Good job.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.132
I took your advice.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.867
I tried to connect.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.703
Didn't do such a good job
with the grandmother, though.

26:10.737 --> 26:13.940
You and Dr. Lewis must think
I'm a complete idiot.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.742
No, no,
you're just inexperienced.

26:15.775 --> 26:17.176
Hey, hey, hey.
Come here.

26:18.845 --> 26:20.980
First, you have to bring them
to the family room

26:21.013 --> 26:22.148
for a death notification.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.216
Sit down.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.986
Somewhere away from the rest
of the patients and staff.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.320
She just got
so hysterical.

26:28.354 --> 26:30.089
Make sure
they're sitting down.

26:30.122 --> 26:33.325
Don't be evasive
and don't use euphemisms.

26:33.359 --> 26:35.361
Use the word "dead"
and the word "is."

26:35.394 --> 26:36.663
I know all this.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.898
Give them a tissue.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.833
Look them in the eye
and make a connection.

26:42.134 --> 26:45.204
Then just say
"I'm very sorry."

26:51.043 --> 26:52.244
It's okay.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.081
I suck.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.983
No, you don't suck.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.085
You're still learning.

27:05.191 --> 27:07.827
( sniffles )

27:10.930 --> 27:13.733
I can't believe this.

27:13.766 --> 27:16.936
I'm in a wedding
next weekend.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.205
One percent lido with epi,
6-0 vicryl.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.808
God, I'm gonna ruin
all the photographs.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.042
Oh, they won't be
looking at you,

27:23.075 --> 27:24.443
they'll be looking
at the bride.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.878
You owe me one.

27:25.912 --> 27:26.746
What? No, I don't.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.047
Yeah, you do.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.016
I put down the NG
on Mrs. Leerburger.

27:30.049 --> 27:31.217
I didn't ask you
to do that.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.218
Dr. Kovac did.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.853
What?

27:33.886 --> 27:35.822
He said you were a little
overextended today.

27:35.855 --> 27:38.825
Unlike the
rest of us.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.993
Uh, Abby,
will you excuse me?

27:41.027 --> 27:42.028
I have to go yell
at someone.

27:42.061 --> 27:43.730
Have fun.

27:43.730 --> 27:46.132
Okay, Miss Tobel,

27:46.165 --> 27:49.902
in the future, try not to pluck
your eyebrows in a moving car.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.871
Okay, numb and prep the wound.

27:51.904 --> 27:52.939
I'll be right back.

27:55.141 --> 27:56.809
MAN:
Get away from me!
I know what you want!

27:56.843 --> 27:58.077
You want to hurt me!
you want to make me suffer!

27:58.110 --> 27:59.378
Security!
( man continues yelling )

27:59.411 --> 28:01.748
Oh, Lockhart.
You're back.

28:01.781 --> 28:02.982
Welcome back.

28:03.015 --> 28:05.117
Thank you.
Um, I called
John Manning

28:05.151 --> 28:07.319
at the International Society
for Traumatic Stress Studies.

28:07.353 --> 28:08.888
Hey. We're looking
for our son.
Have you heard of EMDR?

28:08.921 --> 28:10.322
We've been waiting here
for an hour.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.490
Eye Movement Desensitization
and Reprocessing.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.092
His name is Tevin.
Tevin Burrough.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.293
Hold on.
No, we've been
here for an hour.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.863
Where you going?
Get back here, bitch!

28:16.896 --> 28:18.898
It's been hugely effective
in the treatment of, um,
traumatic disorders.

28:18.931 --> 28:21.067
Uh, basically, you focus
on the most vivid image,

28:21.100 --> 28:22.969
emotion or sensation
in the traumatic memory,

28:23.002 --> 28:25.504
while simultaneously focusing
on an external impulse.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.174
Uh, I've printed out a bunch
of the studies for you.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.009
Maybe you can take
a look at them,

28:30.042 --> 28:32.144
we can talk about 'em tomorrow
or whenever you want.

28:32.178 --> 28:33.780
Okay, thank you.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.181
Good. Okay.

29:04.877 --> 29:06.846
Abby, uh, eyebrow
lac's ready.

29:06.879 --> 29:10.016
You were going to
show me how to do a
running subcuticular.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.085
Right.

29:13.119 --> 29:14.020
Are you okay?

29:14.053 --> 29:15.354
Yes. Yeah, I'm fine.

29:41.347 --> 29:43.349
This won't leave a mark,
will it?

29:43.382 --> 29:47.419
Dr. Lockhart is using
a special technique
to minimize scarring.

29:54.861 --> 29:55.862
Abby?

29:59.031 --> 30:01.467
Um...

30:01.500 --> 30:03.836
I'm sorry,
I can't do this right now.

30:05.537 --> 30:06.605
What?

30:06.638 --> 30:07.874
Sorry.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.179
Joe, what happened?

30:13.212 --> 30:14.446
He threatened
to sue me.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.182
He's parked in front of
a fire hydrant.

30:16.215 --> 30:17.183
What's with
the motor home?

30:17.216 --> 30:19.451
I'm getting rid of it.

30:19.485 --> 30:20.486
( sighs )
Susan.

30:20.519 --> 30:21.888
Yeah.

30:21.921 --> 30:23.389
Uh, I think maybe
I came back too soon.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.091
Are you okay?
I don't know.
I'm just not

30:25.124 --> 30:26.592
in the right frame
of mind to do this.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.427
Okay, go home, take
all the time you need.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.062
And Ray's staying late
to cover for me.

30:30.096 --> 30:31.263
No, it's okay.
Don't worry about us.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.132
Thank you.
I'll call you later.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.400
( sighs )

30:39.038 --> 30:40.606
Sorry. Sorry.

30:46.913 --> 30:48.147
You all right?

30:48.180 --> 30:50.582
Yeah, I'm fine.

30:50.616 --> 30:52.551
God.

30:52.584 --> 30:55.354
( chuckles )

30:59.258 --> 31:00.893
You'll catch the next one.

31:03.229 --> 31:04.363
Thank you.

31:06.632 --> 31:09.201
Spivak, get out here now.

31:09.235 --> 31:10.269
( faint laughter )

31:10.302 --> 31:11.938
( sighs )

31:15.107 --> 31:16.075
Hello, Doctor.

31:16.108 --> 31:19.678
Oh, come on,
we fixed you up!

31:19.711 --> 31:20.646
Jerry?

31:20.679 --> 31:21.981
He has...

31:22.014 --> 31:24.383
really great coffee.

31:26.485 --> 31:27.954
Sorry.

31:30.256 --> 31:33.659
Ah, Dr. Lewis!

31:33.692 --> 31:35.294
Are you, uh...

31:35.327 --> 31:38.197
ready to discuss
this morning's fall?

31:41.100 --> 31:43.602
Did you send
Mr. Fayen to CT?
Yeah.

31:43.635 --> 31:45.137
Yeah, well, I had to go
all the way up to CT

31:45.171 --> 31:46.973
to push morphine, instead
of just doing it here.

31:46.973 --> 31:48.140
Just trying to help.

31:48.174 --> 31:50.142
No, you're being
passive-aggressive.

31:50.176 --> 31:51.677
Why are you so mad?

31:51.710 --> 31:54.046
Because I'm used
to having control
over my own life.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.314
Sam?
What?!

31:55.347 --> 31:57.984
Do you know
where Neela is?
No.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.185
You're the attending
on Amy Packer,

31:59.218 --> 32:00.586
the foster kid, right?
Yeah.

32:00.619 --> 32:03.255
This is Mari Hinojosa
from DCFS.

32:03.289 --> 32:04.356
I have bad news.

32:10.296 --> 32:11.497
I think that's everything.

32:11.530 --> 32:12.598
Thank you.

32:12.631 --> 32:15.101
Desensitization
Reprocessing?

32:15.134 --> 32:19.038
Yeah, it's some crazy
stuff Dubenko gave me.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.706
Want me to give it a try?

32:20.739 --> 32:23.042
No, I think it's dead.

32:23.075 --> 32:25.444
Procrastinating.

32:29.781 --> 32:33.219
Didn't miss it at all.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.187
Work. Over the holidays.

32:35.221 --> 32:36.522
( chuckles )

32:36.555 --> 32:38.724
I must have really made
an impression on you.

32:38.757 --> 32:40.726
You didn't even notice
I was gone for a week.

32:40.759 --> 32:43.329
No, I remember.

32:43.362 --> 32:45.031
You're that guy
with the beard.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.366
Yeah.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.035
Where'd you go?

32:49.068 --> 32:50.669
Yellowstone.

32:50.702 --> 32:52.671
Most beautiful
place on earth.

32:52.704 --> 32:54.040
You ever been?

32:56.242 --> 32:57.609
I didn't realize it
until I was smack

32:57.643 --> 32:59.278
in the middle of the geysers,
but the whole thing

32:59.311 --> 33:03.049
is actually one
gigantic, active volcano.

33:03.049 --> 33:04.116
Did you know that?

33:04.150 --> 33:06.185
No, I did not.

33:06.218 --> 33:07.719
It could blow
at any second.

33:07.753 --> 33:09.688
It's actually
30,000 years overdue.

33:11.223 --> 33:13.059
And what would
happen if it did?

33:14.393 --> 33:17.696
It would wipe out
most of the western U.S.,

33:17.729 --> 33:19.698
cover the rest
of the country in ash,

33:19.731 --> 33:24.136
wreak havoc
on the global climate.

33:24.170 --> 33:25.771
Is that all?

33:25.804 --> 33:29.141
We'd be gone
in an instant, just...

33:29.175 --> 33:30.509
like that.

33:30.542 --> 33:32.444
That's how fragile life is,
but you know that.

33:32.478 --> 33:33.479
You working in the E.R.

33:33.512 --> 33:34.513
Yeah.

33:38.750 --> 33:44.790
Human life span is so short
anyways, it's almost irrelevant.

33:44.823 --> 33:46.192
Are you high?

33:50.462 --> 33:51.597
Here's your train.

33:55.267 --> 33:56.735
See you later.

33:56.768 --> 33:57.769
Thank you.

34:01.273 --> 34:02.408
Bye.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.219
Between the paramedics
and the doctors here,

34:13.252 --> 34:15.121
we worked on him
for 45 minutes,

34:15.121 --> 34:17.589
but his injuries
were too severe.

34:17.623 --> 34:20.492
His mother died
when he was five.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.128
Your son did
very well in surgery.

34:22.128 --> 34:23.829
They were able to control
the bleeding in his liver.

34:23.862 --> 34:26.598
Since then, it's just
been the two of us.

34:26.632 --> 34:30.268
He wasn't in any pain,
and he didn't suffer.

34:30.302 --> 34:31.137
LACEY:
I knew something like this

34:31.170 --> 34:33.705
was going to happen.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.174
His heart and his brain
were spared,

34:35.206 --> 34:36.775
He'll probably
end up doing just fine.

34:36.808 --> 34:39.445
He was even talking
about going to college.

34:39.478 --> 34:40.746
I'm very sorry.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.161
PRATT:
He's going to be groggy

34:55.161 --> 34:56.828
but he might be able
to hear what you're saying.

34:58.564 --> 35:01.700
Take as much time
as you need to say good-bye.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.749
This isn't my grandson.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.285
This isn't my son.

35:25.891 --> 35:28.360
( train rumbling )

35:28.394 --> 35:29.861
Hello?

35:29.895 --> 35:31.930
Hi.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.899
No.

35:33.932 --> 35:35.534
No, they can't refuse
to admit her.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.536
She's got post-op adhesions.

35:37.569 --> 35:39.305
HALEH:
Hurry, 'cause Surgery's
going to rip our heads off

35:39.338 --> 35:40.806
if we don't admit to Medicine.

35:40.839 --> 35:45.611
Haleh, listen, okay,
just push four of morphine,

35:45.644 --> 35:47.646
and I'll be there
in a minute, okay?

35:47.679 --> 35:48.680
Fine. Bye.

35:48.714 --> 35:49.615
How the hell did this happen?

35:49.648 --> 35:51.217
I'm not sure yet, but...

35:51.250 --> 35:52.684
Were the patients mislabeled?
I don't know.

35:52.718 --> 35:54.320
Did they look the same?

35:54.353 --> 35:55.321
Was there a computer glitch?

35:55.354 --> 35:57.223
I-I don't know.

35:57.223 --> 35:58.590
All I know is that
there were two
John Does, both 16,

35:58.624 --> 36:00.692
both gunshot wounds,
both gang-related.

36:00.726 --> 36:02.861
And both treated in Trauma One
a few hours apart.

36:02.894 --> 36:04.730
Susan, I just do not understand
how this happened.

36:04.763 --> 36:06.298
Whatever it was,

36:06.332 --> 36:07.899
there was a massive
communication failure.

36:07.933 --> 36:11.270
Well, it's your job to make sure
that people communicate.

36:11.303 --> 36:13.272
I take full
responsibility for it.

36:13.305 --> 36:14.406
PRATT:
We screwed up.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.441
Neither of us knew

36:15.474 --> 36:16.542
there were two
John Does today.

36:16.575 --> 36:17.643
We didn't speak
to each other,

36:17.676 --> 36:18.610
and we didn't check
the board.

36:18.644 --> 36:19.911
Who was in
which trauma?

36:19.945 --> 36:21.513
Neela, Sam and I
worked on a dead kid

36:21.547 --> 36:23.382
with a saphenous cutdown.

36:23.415 --> 36:24.816
Morris, Ray and
Pratt were with me
in the other one.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.453
And there was no overlap
between the traumas?

36:27.486 --> 36:29.788
JANE:
I was in both.

36:29.821 --> 36:30.756
Who's that?

36:30.789 --> 36:31.957
LEWIS:
Med student.

36:31.990 --> 36:33.525
I put a name alert on the board.

36:33.559 --> 36:35.794
Jane, why didn't
you say anything?

36:35.827 --> 36:37.329
No one listens to me.

36:37.363 --> 36:39.798
No one even remembers
I was in the room.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.835
Uh, you guys look
like you could use a vacation.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.337
No.

36:45.371 --> 36:47.873
I got this great timeshare
down in Boca Grande

36:47.906 --> 36:49.808
that I let friends use.

36:49.841 --> 36:51.277
"Friends"?

36:51.310 --> 36:53.579
Well, you know,
friends that refer friends.

36:53.612 --> 36:57.416
It's got a great house
and this beautiful boat,

36:57.449 --> 36:59.285
and a pair
of jet skis.

36:59.318 --> 37:01.687
Spivak? Security!

37:02.954 --> 37:05.791
Come on, give me
a break, will you?

37:09.561 --> 37:11.297
You're back.
Yup.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.998
Thought your
shift was over.

37:13.031 --> 37:14.600
No, not till 10:00.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.868
So, you were just
taking a break?

37:16.902 --> 37:17.869
I guess so.

37:17.903 --> 37:19.305
Up on the EL tracks?

37:19.338 --> 37:20.539
Yeah.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.474
I love it up there.
Me, too.

37:22.508 --> 37:24.710
You never know who
you might run into.

37:27.413 --> 37:28.614
We just put them
through hell.

37:28.647 --> 37:29.915
What are you going
to say to them?

37:29.948 --> 37:31.550
I'll tell the truth.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.785
Families of dead
patients don't
remember much.

37:33.819 --> 37:36.822
The only thing they remember
is if it seemed like you cared.

37:36.855 --> 37:39.925
If you were honest
and direct with them.

37:39.958 --> 37:42.694
Did Dr. Lewis tell you
to keep me away from them?

37:44.596 --> 37:46.332
Yeah.

37:50.402 --> 37:53.905
I want to go in with you.

37:53.939 --> 37:54.940
Okay.

38:03.682 --> 38:06.418
It's unconstitutional.

38:06.452 --> 38:07.886
LEWIS:
Thank you.

38:07.919 --> 38:10.356
Do not cross this line,
or I will have you arrested.

38:10.389 --> 38:11.890
I don't see any line.

38:11.923 --> 38:13.725
You know what I mean,
you can't come back here.

38:13.759 --> 38:15.794
You can't do this,
this is a public institution.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.863
That doesn't matter.

38:17.896 --> 38:19.765
Well, you're violating
my civil rights.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.967
I never got to see a doctor.

38:22.000 --> 38:22.968
So, sue me.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.002
Your office
is being towed,

38:24.035 --> 38:25.537
by the way.

38:25.571 --> 38:28.974
Yo! Yo, yo, yo, yo,
yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

38:29.007 --> 38:30.976
Whoa, ho, ho, ho, ho!

38:31.009 --> 38:32.778
Come on! Yo!

38:32.811 --> 38:33.945
Come on, have some pity!

38:33.979 --> 38:35.447
So much for Herb.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.949
Whatever. You
know he'll be back.

38:43.021 --> 38:44.623
Amy?

38:45.824 --> 38:46.758
What's going on?

38:46.792 --> 38:47.626
Who are you?

38:47.659 --> 38:48.794
I'm her doctor.

38:48.827 --> 38:49.695
I'm bringing her
to the Haley home.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.530
What?
She lied to me.

38:51.563 --> 38:52.664
Go talk
to your social worker.

38:52.698 --> 38:53.932
I don't understand. Stop.

38:53.965 --> 38:55.734
I have two more
kids to pick up.

38:55.767 --> 38:56.768
Please don't make
my job any harder.

38:56.802 --> 38:57.903
Amy, wait.

38:57.936 --> 38:59.571
She told me I
could go home.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.443
30 days?

39:04.476 --> 39:05.911
You can start having
visitors after two weeks.

39:05.944 --> 39:07.413
I need to
talk to you.

39:07.413 --> 39:09.481
Cold turkey,
just like that?

39:09.515 --> 39:12.117
They'll give you medication
to help ease the withdrawal.

39:12.150 --> 39:15.787
Think about it, okay?

39:15.821 --> 39:16.855
How could you pull Amy

39:16.888 --> 39:18.457
out of her home
behind my back?

39:18.490 --> 39:19.425
It wasn't behind
your back.

39:19.458 --> 39:20.559
We got new information.

39:20.592 --> 39:21.760
We had a plan for her.

39:21.793 --> 39:23.094
Her regular caseworker
was out of town.

39:23.128 --> 39:24.730
Why didn't anyone tell me?

39:24.763 --> 39:26.465
If you would stop interrupting
and let me finish one...

39:26.498 --> 39:27.633
You're supposed to consult
the doctor on the case

39:27.666 --> 39:28.634
before making a decision
like this.

39:28.667 --> 39:30.669
Kovac signed off.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.638
Hey.

39:32.671 --> 39:34.906
I'm hating doctors
right now.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.174
Neela's mad,

39:36.207 --> 39:38.477
Ray practically accused me
of elder abuse,

39:38.510 --> 39:39.745
and Morris laughed at me

39:39.778 --> 39:41.046
when this kid
kicked me in the shin.

39:41.079 --> 39:42.481
I was going to ask you
if you were ready to go.

39:42.514 --> 39:43.749
That's all
you have to say?

39:43.782 --> 39:45.083
Well, you know, we come

39:45.116 --> 39:47.486
from different
perspectives sometimes,

39:47.519 --> 39:48.887
and sometimes
we disagree.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.856
But whatever happened,
you were right.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.458
Why didn't you
tell me about Amy?

39:52.458 --> 39:53.825
I was going to.
When?

39:53.859 --> 39:55.761
When I had time,
and I thought it might be better

39:55.794 --> 39:57.195
if you found out
after your shift.

39:57.228 --> 39:58.497
I'm an adult.

39:58.530 --> 39:59.798
I don't need you
to protect me.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.066
I wasn't trying to protect you.

40:01.099 --> 40:02.167
You made a good decision

40:02.200 --> 40:03.835
based on the information
you had,

40:03.869 --> 40:05.571
but there was a pattern
of incidents.

40:05.604 --> 40:08.840
Like what?
Like...

40:08.874 --> 40:11.710
April 16,
scald injury to shoulder.

40:11.743 --> 40:12.944
Sounds pretty minor to me.

40:12.978 --> 40:15.881
July 14,
bite wound inflicted by brother.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.849
Who we know
has behavioral issues.

40:17.883 --> 40:19.985
October 20, clavicular fracture
after a "fall."

40:20.018 --> 40:22.120
November 30,
14-centimeter leg lac

40:22.153 --> 40:23.922
after "tripping on stairs."

40:23.955 --> 40:28.093
Her history wasn't consistent
with her injuries.
Okay.

40:28.126 --> 40:29.895
Each one is not a big deal,
but together...

40:29.928 --> 40:31.029
I got it.

40:32.631 --> 40:33.999
I thought it was a done deal.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.867
I told Amy everything
was going to work out.

40:35.901 --> 40:36.768
I got her hopes up.

40:36.802 --> 40:38.036
Well, in the end,

40:38.069 --> 40:39.738
we're doing the right thing
for her.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.940
So, why not just tell me that?

40:41.973 --> 40:46.612
I was worried that finding out
would make you lose confidence,

40:46.645 --> 40:50.682
and I didn't want that
to happen, so...

40:50.716 --> 40:53.719
If I was trying to protect you,
I'm sorry, okay?

40:57.823 --> 40:58.857
You know, I didn't always

40:58.890 --> 41:01.493
used to be a mobile lawyer.

41:01.527 --> 41:04.996
I used to have big
money-- big, big money.

41:05.030 --> 41:07.833
Then I lost my shirt
on niftypets.com.

41:07.866 --> 41:09.901
Can I get something
for the pain?

41:09.935 --> 41:11.837
Sure, as soon as we finish
with this paperwork

41:11.870 --> 41:13.271
required by our lawyer

41:13.304 --> 41:15.106
to guard against, you know,
frivolous lawsuits.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.675
I ain't signing nothing.

41:16.708 --> 41:19.611
This document gives us
permission to treat you.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.880
The second one
specifies whether you have

41:21.913 --> 41:23.649
an advanced directive
or a living will.

41:23.682 --> 41:24.616
Are you serious?

41:24.650 --> 41:26.017
If your heart stops

41:26.051 --> 41:27.152
or you stop breathing,
do you want us to use

41:27.185 --> 41:28.754
heroic measures
to resuscitate you?

41:28.787 --> 41:30.188
Just put me out of my misery.

41:32.691 --> 41:33.659
Hi.
Hey.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.293
I'm leaving for the day.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.728
I'm waiting
on a transfer patient,

41:36.762 --> 41:38.129
so I'll walk
out with you.

41:38.163 --> 41:40.566
Listen, I'm sorry
about this morning.

41:40.599 --> 41:41.767
No, I'm sorry.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.134
I've been camping out
on your couch

41:43.168 --> 41:44.703
for six months.

41:44.736 --> 41:45.837
I didn't mean to
be a jerk about it.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.873
No, I needed
a good kick in the ass.

41:47.906 --> 41:53.244
And I found a place--
with, uh, Ray, actually--

41:53.278 --> 41:56.882
so I'll be leaving
at the end of the week.

41:56.915 --> 41:58.183
Well, take your time.

41:58.216 --> 42:00.586
There's no rush,
and by the way,

42:00.619 --> 42:02.220
are you nuts?

42:02.253 --> 42:04.656
Yes. Yes, I am.

42:04.690 --> 42:06.925
So... random question.

42:06.958 --> 42:08.259
ABBY:
Yes?

42:08.293 --> 42:11.096
Do you ever get crushes
on people you work with?

42:11.129 --> 42:12.764
What do you mean?

42:12.798 --> 42:15.901
You know, crushes...
on people... you work with.

42:15.934 --> 42:17.302
Yeah, I guess,
sometimes. Why?

42:17.335 --> 42:19.605
I don't know...

42:22.107 --> 42:23.108
What?
What?

42:23.141 --> 42:24.342
What?

42:24.375 --> 42:25.611
Are you leaving
for the night?

42:25.644 --> 42:28.614
Yeah. Good night, guys.

42:28.614 --> 42:30.649
Good night.
Night.

42:30.682 --> 42:32.851
Good night.

42:32.884 --> 42:35.253
See you at home.
Okay.

42:53.138 --> 42:54.640
You know,
you're really good

42:54.673 --> 42:58.209
at teaching other people
how to communicate.

42:58.243 --> 42:59.678
Thanks.

43:02.247 --> 43:04.650
We should try it ourselves
sometime.

43:07.753 --> 43:08.720
Yeah.

43:16.795 --> 43:18.864
But my English, you know...

43:18.897 --> 43:21.266
( laughs softly )

43:21.299 --> 43:23.068
Now you're going to pull
the Croatian card?

43:23.101 --> 43:24.736
That's low.

43:26.872 --> 43:28.907
You were right
about one thing.

43:28.940 --> 43:32.310
Oh, only one thing?
Mm-hmm.

43:32.343 --> 43:35.280
50 bucks was too much
for a concert ticket.
