WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:06.005
"Happy Birthday, Big Man!

00:06.089 --> 00:08.049
"We love you,
Barack and Michelle.

00:08.133 --> 00:09.718
"In lieu of a gift,
we made a donation

00:09.801 --> 00:12.220
in your name to one
our favorite charities."

00:12.303 --> 00:13.680
Fuckin' lame!

00:13.763 --> 00:16.057
What about a donation
and a gift?

00:16.141 --> 00:17.267
Why don't they do that?

00:17.350 --> 00:18.893
You get it, Snowie.
Right?

00:18.977 --> 00:20.729
-Mm-hm.
-Santa: You've always
been there for me.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.981
You know, I shouldn't
be telling anyone this,

00:23.064 --> 00:25.483
but I made a big decision,
and I just need to tell someone,

00:25.567 --> 00:27.277
or... I think
I'm gonna fuckin' puke.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.904
I've finally decided
who to make my Successor.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.614
-It's Candy!
-(cheers)

00:31.698 --> 00:32.907
Awesome choice, right?

00:32.991 --> 00:34.534
And the headlines will read,

00:34.617 --> 00:37.036
"Santa chooses
a woman Successor,

00:37.120 --> 00:39.122
and makes history! Again!"

00:39.205 --> 00:41.499
Boom!
But I'm gonna sit on it.

00:41.583 --> 00:44.627
Make the Board sweat it out.
Those fuckin' dicks.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.464
Okay, Snowie, see you around--
Well, not around, but, you know,

00:47.547 --> 00:49.632
in here, in the office,
where you live.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.051
I'll see you later. Jesus.
Whatever, you get it.

00:52.135 --> 00:52.969
(door closes)

00:53.052 --> 00:57.307
-(toilet flushes)
-Oh my shit!

00:57.390 --> 00:58.975
It should be me!

00:59.058 --> 01:00.143
(snow globe shatters)

01:00.226 --> 01:03.646
-Whoa!
-(bells jingling)

01:03.730 --> 01:06.399
(joyful music playing)

01:10.153 --> 01:11.321
(coughs)

01:15.992 --> 01:18.286
(Junior cries)

01:21.247 --> 01:23.124
(both laughing)

01:23.208 --> 01:26.544
Yes, teens, it is I.
Assuming you'd like a selfie.

01:26.628 --> 01:30.465
-With Junior?
The washed-up reindeer?
-Ugh, no thanks.

01:30.548 --> 01:33.259
We heard you
beat up a woman
just to become Santa?

01:33.343 --> 01:34.886
It was only a golf game!

01:34.969 --> 01:36.930
And I didn't touch
that lyin' dwarf!

01:37.013 --> 01:40.266
Ah! Run away!
He's toxic!

01:40.350 --> 01:41.518
Fuckin' fake news.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.729
Bitch elf, ruined
my gorgeous reputation.

01:45.688 --> 01:48.316
(choir music plays)

01:50.026 --> 01:51.694
You look like you
could use a friend.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.447
And, uh, maybe,
a career-saving makeover?

01:54.531 --> 01:56.533
(burps)
Amen to that.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.701
Candy: So I got rid
of that puss, Junior.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.203
Jingle Jim's a long shot.

02:00.286 --> 02:04.040
Larson and Timmy the Toy Guy
are my only real competition.

02:04.123 --> 02:06.376
And I am playing this
like a man would, right?

02:06.459 --> 02:09.212
You know what I'm talkin' about,
you handsome motherfucker.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.964
(both laughing)

02:11.047 --> 02:14.676
Candy, what a treat.
We never see you anymore.

02:14.759 --> 02:17.679
No guilt!
But it has been so long.

02:17.762 --> 02:19.347
I know.
Do I look taller to you?

02:19.430 --> 02:21.182
-Like, I feel taller.
-Maybe.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.518
Do I look any
different to you...

02:23.601 --> 02:26.187
like more pregnant?
Hint, hint.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.897
Whoa! What?
You're pregnant?

02:27.981 --> 02:30.733
-That-- What, what
did the doctor say?
-I didn't go to a doctor.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.361
-What did the home
pregnancy test say?
-Did not do one.

02:33.444 --> 02:36.573
-But you missed your period?
-No, I know my body,

02:36.656 --> 02:39.075
and it is carrying
Fun Size's sister.

02:39.158 --> 02:40.285
Probably named Symone.

02:40.368 --> 02:43.079
Okay, sorry.
I guess I'm wrong.
Congrats.

02:43.162 --> 02:45.582
Thank you!
But don't tell
anyone at work.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.126
Larson axes women
when they get pregnant.

02:48.209 --> 02:51.337
And he's currently fucking
two factory workers.

02:51.421 --> 02:54.173
-Identical twin sisters.
-Oh, is he?

02:54.257 --> 02:56.551
(ominous music plays)

02:56.634 --> 02:58.386
My baby shower is
this Saturday night.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.096
-Don't forget.
-Halloween?!

03:00.179 --> 03:02.473
No, I--
That's Santa's birthday.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.475
I'm the host this year.
It's a huge deal.

03:04.559 --> 03:07.979
Santa's birthday's practically
like a, a North Pole holiday.

03:08.062 --> 03:10.148
(cries)
What is next?
Mother's Day?

03:10.231 --> 03:12.442
Okay, stop.
God, don't cry.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.110
It's fine.
I can do both.

03:14.193 --> 03:15.653
I can...
stop by here,

03:15.737 --> 03:17.030
and then
get to his thing.

03:17.113 --> 03:19.115
But I should
get to work
right now, so...

03:19.198 --> 03:21.242
Cool!
And you don't have
to get me a present.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.911
But if you do,
make it a gift card

03:22.994 --> 03:25.747
because I don't trust
your taste. Byeee.

03:25.830 --> 03:28.833
Timmy the Toy Guy:
I made a gift
for Santa's birthday,

03:28.917 --> 03:31.753
and, well...
I wanted your opinion

03:31.836 --> 03:34.088
since you work
so closely together.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.925
Oh god, yeah.
I totally know his taste.

03:37.008 --> 03:39.594
(light music plays)

03:43.514 --> 03:44.849
Magnificent.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.559
But doesn't it look
a little like--

03:46.643 --> 03:49.145
A little like what?

03:49.228 --> 03:52.148
(ominous music plays)

03:52.231 --> 03:54.067
The perfect gift
for the man

03:54.150 --> 03:55.360
who has everything?

03:55.443 --> 03:58.321
Bravo, Timmy, bravo!

03:58.404 --> 03:59.739
Okay, so busy.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.491
Tight schedule. Gotta go.

04:03.117 --> 04:07.997
(laughs)
We've almost made it, Hans-Otto!

04:08.915 --> 04:10.833
(Jeremy laughs)

04:10.917 --> 04:12.502
Candy:
Seating chart? Done.

04:12.585 --> 04:15.463
Beverages? Done.
Appetizers? Done.

04:15.546 --> 04:16.881
All right, get up
and help, bozo.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.591
You're in charge
of ice sculptures.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.677
Sure, everybody
loves ice sculptures,

04:20.760 --> 04:22.553
but if I mush together
a bunch of human babies

04:22.637 --> 04:24.347
for my party,
they'll call me a monster.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.890
You know what? Excuse me,

04:25.974 --> 04:29.060
I need to cry
at the inhumanity
displayed here.

04:29.143 --> 04:30.645
Don't follow me!

04:30.728 --> 04:32.021
Whoa! Look at you.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.940
I didn't know it
was Picture Day.

04:34.023 --> 04:36.067
You look
Devin-ishly handsome.

04:36.150 --> 04:38.820
Just tryna step up my game.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.530
I...

04:40.613 --> 04:42.991
have something
to talk to you about,

04:43.074 --> 04:46.035
-but I'm really nervous.
-Aw, that's so flattering.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.829
Are you scared
shitless of me, too?

04:47.912 --> 04:50.373
I've always wanted someone
to be scared shitless of me.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.792
-Definitely. Very shitless.
-Yay!

04:52.875 --> 04:53.751
Okay, here it goes,

04:53.835 --> 04:55.086
if you're made Successor,

04:55.169 --> 04:57.255
I'd like to be considered
as your Number Two.

04:57.338 --> 05:00.550
I'm not just some college slob.
I want a career here.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.218
Look at this straight talk.

05:02.301 --> 05:04.178
And the ambition? I love it!

05:04.262 --> 05:06.431
Very Candy circa Boxing Day.

05:06.514 --> 05:09.392
And as far as becoming
my Number Two,
with a shit-ton of training,

05:09.475 --> 05:11.978
I can possibly see it
happening in like 15 years,

05:12.061 --> 05:16.482
-but, you know, no promises.
-15 years, but no promises?

05:16.566 --> 05:20.111
Candy, you're making
a boy's dreams come true!

05:20.194 --> 05:23.740
Woo!

05:23.823 --> 05:25.700
You will never go
far in this industry

05:25.783 --> 05:27.744
by whirling
your boss around.

05:27.827 --> 05:28.870
Writin' that one down.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.121
All right,
let's get to work.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.831
I'm planning Santa's party.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.292
Brent always did
a lot of nice toasts,

05:34.375 --> 05:36.044
you know, "We love you...
blah, blah, blah."

05:36.127 --> 05:37.420
I wanna go bigger.

05:37.503 --> 05:40.381
I'm thinking I'd go
more roast than toast.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.758
Dudes love that shit!

05:41.841 --> 05:45.303
Brutality hidden under
the veil of lighthearted banter?

05:45.386 --> 05:46.971
Yeah! On my 21st,

05:47.055 --> 05:48.973
Horse Cock did
a tight 45 minutes

05:49.057 --> 05:50.600
on how fat my ass was.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.226
I laughed so hard that night...

05:52.310 --> 05:54.312
though I cried myself to sleep.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.897
I'm sure it was unrelated.

05:55.980 --> 05:58.608
Roasts are hilarious,
as long as you have
good material.

05:58.691 --> 06:03.446
Oh, do I.
(ominous laugh)

06:03.529 --> 06:05.740
I-I can't stop
eating ham.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.867
When I was pregnant
with Fun Size,

06:07.950 --> 06:09.619
all I wanted
was Oreos.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.037
Isn't that kinda
cannibalistic?

06:11.120 --> 06:12.955
That'd be like
me eating venison.

06:14.832 --> 06:18.127
Ladies... Goldie.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.296
An invite to Santa's
birthday party?

06:20.379 --> 06:22.465
Candy said it was
for work people only.

06:22.548 --> 06:25.510
It is, but I'm
on a career track
at Santa Inc.,

06:25.593 --> 06:27.678
and was given
a special plus-one

06:27.762 --> 06:30.723
to the North Pole's
biggest event of the year,

06:30.807 --> 06:32.308
besides Christmas,
of course.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.060
And you, m'lady,

06:34.143 --> 06:36.104
are the only one
I want to invite.

06:36.187 --> 06:39.357
Oh my god,
that is so sweet.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.025
Sorry, I can't.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.652
That's the night
of Cookie's baby shower.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.488
Oh my god,
that is so sweet.

06:45.571 --> 06:48.366
Oh, you can reject me now,
but I'll be back.

06:48.449 --> 06:51.035
We dyslexics
don't give up easily.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.332
Oh! Oh! Oh!

06:56.415 --> 07:00.294
Oh-eee! Oh.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.380
Oh, that was great, oh.

07:02.463 --> 07:06.175
I'm sorry I screamed
about fuckin' a goblin
before I came.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.260
Don't read into that.

07:07.343 --> 07:10.346
Happy 75th birthday, Nick.

07:10.429 --> 07:13.015
Now maybe you'd
like to do oral sex?

07:13.099 --> 07:14.600
Sure, yeah,
I'll take
another Viagra,

07:14.684 --> 07:16.686
and then I'll, uh,
have another erection,

07:16.769 --> 07:18.855
-and then, uh--
-I meant on me.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.149
What? On my birthday?

07:21.232 --> 07:25.903
Yes! Now get under those covers,
and go down on your fucking wife

07:25.987 --> 07:30.199
for once since
Biggie killed Tupac!

07:30.283 --> 07:31.868
Jeremy (oh phone):
Oh... (gags)--

07:31.951 --> 07:33.411
Ah, I-- Ugh.

07:33.494 --> 07:35.288
I can't help tonight.
I'm sick.

07:35.371 --> 07:37.832
Yeah, I've got
a fever and chills.

07:37.915 --> 07:39.709
Jeremy, I know
you're lying.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.419
I can see you
floating by.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.379
Now I have to go.
You've made me late.

07:43.462 --> 07:45.548
Jeremy:
The one doing
Molly isn't me!

07:45.631 --> 07:46.883
Hey, pass that Molly.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.010
Have fun
at Santa's party.

07:49.093 --> 07:51.721
We'll be spending
a quiet night at home.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.390
There's a World War I
doc I'm gonna watch.

07:54.473 --> 07:56.976
I'll always regret
never bein' in a war.

07:57.059 --> 07:58.936
Legal murder is the shit.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.731
And I'll spend the night
getting ahead on my taxes?

08:01.814 --> 08:04.859
Ha! I knew you
assholes are crashing.

08:04.942 --> 08:07.361
Just don't embarrass me
until my roast is over.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.780
This is gonna be Santa's
best birthday party ever.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.700
Could you make sure to mention
the retired coal miners?

08:12.783 --> 08:15.786
Exposure to that
fancy crowd will
really help the cause.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.580
Grandpa, no.
Tonight's a celebration.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.707
It's not a time
for depressing
shit like that.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.084
Coal miners' issues are
anything but depressing!

08:22.168 --> 08:24.253
Tony knows.
He's been hangin'
out there lately.

08:24.337 --> 08:28.049
(coughing)

08:28.132 --> 08:30.218
Bein' down there
gave me coal cough.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.221
Well, that's all
she wrote, evil world.

08:33.846 --> 08:34.889
See ya!

08:34.972 --> 08:37.016
Ahh!

08:37.099 --> 08:40.311
-(crash, car alarm beeps)
-(woman screams)

08:40.394 --> 08:44.232
Yeah, the coal miners' cause
is not depressing at all.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.816
(softly):
Oh shit.

08:45.900 --> 08:46.776
Candy says

08:46.859 --> 08:48.277
she's sorry
she can't come,

08:48.361 --> 08:50.196
but she'll make
it up to you.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.447
I'm so sorry, Cook.

08:51.530 --> 08:53.157
To be honest,
I think I used

08:53.241 --> 08:56.619
this shower as an excuse
for us to spend time with her.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.705
You know what?
Go to Santa's birthday
party with Devin.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.040
Really?
You wouldn't care?

09:01.123 --> 09:02.166
Oh, I would resent you,

09:02.250 --> 09:04.961
and talk tons of shit
for many years,

09:05.044 --> 09:06.963
but I can't control you...

09:07.046 --> 09:08.798
Kidding! I don't care.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.299
I have Craig and Fun Size.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.969
Now get outta here, bitch.

09:13.052 --> 09:16.180
Oh, that is the most
sentimental "bitch"
I've ever said.

09:17.932 --> 09:21.435
Craig?
Runnin' low on ham!

09:21.519 --> 09:23.771
Candy:
Happy Birthday, Santa.

09:23.854 --> 09:27.483
Tonight there will be cake,
there will be presents...

09:27.567 --> 09:31.362
and yes, oh yes,
there will be blood.

09:31.445 --> 09:35.950
I mean, not real,
but metaphorical blood.

09:36.033 --> 09:39.036
Guest: Hey, Candy.
Nice gangster costume!

09:39.120 --> 09:41.163
This glass has a smudge.
Not acceptable.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.291
This is Santa's
birthday party!

09:43.374 --> 09:45.126
Take them all back.

09:45.209 --> 09:47.044
Pinocchio is
a bastardization

09:47.128 --> 09:50.256
-of an old fairytale
in which the boy dies--
-Sexy and hilarious.

09:50.339 --> 09:53.509
-(laughing)
-(party music plays)

09:53.592 --> 09:56.262
And, well, yes,
I'm the character
The Great Gatsby

09:56.345 --> 09:58.389
from the book
"The Great Gatsby."

10:00.599 --> 10:02.560
-You look beautiful.
-I'm Tonya Harding.

10:02.643 --> 10:04.061
She was the first
American to land

10:04.145 --> 10:05.646
a triple axel
in competition.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.940
A badass and a true athlete.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.276
Double vodka martini.
Straight up.

10:10.359 --> 10:11.193
You got it.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.612
I love your costume,
Mrs. Claus.

10:13.696 --> 10:16.449
Did you want your
martini... dirty?

10:16.532 --> 10:19.535
(chuckles)
Make it filthy.

10:19.618 --> 10:20.995
So filthy someone
needs to call

10:21.078 --> 10:24.040
the Health Department.
(laughs)

10:24.123 --> 10:28.711
Welcome to Santa's
75th Birthday Extravaganza!

10:28.794 --> 10:31.047
It's a big one,
ladies and jellybeans.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.548
Now pipe down and shut it,

10:32.631 --> 10:35.551
or I'll mow your asses
to the ground!

10:35.634 --> 10:37.636
But first, a few of our
Successor contenders

10:37.720 --> 10:41.474
would like to speak
to Santa on his big day.

10:41.557 --> 10:42.892
(cheers)

10:42.975 --> 10:46.437
At first, I considered
the tried and true,

10:46.520 --> 10:48.230
a cupcake-of-the-month club

10:48.314 --> 10:50.274
subscription for Santa,

10:50.358 --> 10:52.360
but then, I was like,

10:52.443 --> 10:56.489
"What about two cupcakes
every month club?"

10:56.572 --> 10:59.533
Unfortunately,
it does not exist.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.494
So, I went--
And now...

11:01.577 --> 11:03.204
without further ado,

11:03.287 --> 11:05.623
I would like
to reveal to you,

11:05.706 --> 11:08.584
my gift for Santa.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.795
-A toy that represents...
-(winding clicks)

11:10.878 --> 11:12.630
your lifetime.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.340
(music box plays)

11:14.423 --> 11:17.301
-(guest ooh and aah)
-Santa: Ah.

11:19.095 --> 11:22.306
(guests cheering
and applauding)

11:24.225 --> 11:26.102
Santa:
God.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.228
(sighs)

11:30.731 --> 11:33.401
Santa:
Bravo, bravo!

11:33.484 --> 11:34.485
Big Candy:
Psst, hey, honey.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.779
How'd you like
to meet Mr. Claus?

11:36.862 --> 11:38.572
Mr. Lobster Claws!

11:38.656 --> 11:41.075
(grunting)

11:41.158 --> 11:43.786
Candy:
Tonight we've heard
some beautiful toasts.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.163
But now, let's get
to the real fun.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.707
A roast...
not of Santa...

11:48.791 --> 11:51.919
of my fellow
Successor contenders.

11:52.002 --> 11:54.380
Oh yeah! I love a roast!

11:54.463 --> 11:56.132
First of my rivals, Junior.

11:56.215 --> 11:59.427
But God and a bad game of golf
have already taken care of him.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.429
-(guests laughing)
-Guest: Oh, sick burn!

12:01.512 --> 12:03.013
So, let's move
on to Jingle Jim.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.724
Turns out he's had a hard life.
Why make it worse, right?

12:05.808 --> 12:08.769
Amp it up!
You're bein' too nice.
Be a bad bitch!

12:08.853 --> 12:11.147
Hold your reindeer,
birthday boy!

12:11.230 --> 12:13.149
Now, what about
our own Timmy?

12:13.232 --> 12:15.109
All he ever talks
about is toys.

12:15.192 --> 12:17.903
I had no idea he was
a history buff, too...

12:17.987 --> 12:19.864
until I saw
his gift to Santa.

12:19.947 --> 12:24.034
It blew me away
in about six million
different ways.

12:24.118 --> 12:28.622
-(guests booing)
-I did not see that
when I designed it.

12:28.706 --> 12:33.043
Not see!
You hear me? Not see!

12:34.170 --> 12:37.047
Not see! Am I helping?!

12:37.131 --> 12:38.591
Oh, he is a Nazi.

12:38.674 --> 12:40.468
Holy shit!

12:40.551 --> 12:43.762
That might have
actually been the best
moment of my entire life.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.681
(quietly):
Bang bang, fuck face.

12:45.764 --> 12:48.058
Oh my god,
that was awful.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.436
Let's continue
with something
sweeter...

12:50.519 --> 12:52.646
or someone sweeter.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.191
Our own Larson,
King of Chocolate,

12:55.274 --> 12:58.068
and a longtime supporter
of women's rights,

12:58.152 --> 13:00.738
not to mention
their tits and asses.

13:00.821 --> 13:03.741
Ha! I wish.
Married 28 years.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.159
And I don't
need to cheat.

13:05.242 --> 13:07.495
My hot wife and I
fuck constantly!

13:07.578 --> 13:09.747
She just gave me
a handy under the table!

13:09.830 --> 13:10.831
Both: Larson!

13:10.915 --> 13:12.791
You told me you
guys never fucked!

13:12.875 --> 13:13.959
Wait, what?!

13:14.043 --> 13:15.711
You don't even have a vagina.

13:15.794 --> 13:17.588
Mrs. Claus:
A cheater as Santa?

13:17.671 --> 13:20.382
Jingle Jim:
A swinger as Successor?

13:20.466 --> 13:23.636
This is going to alienate
the evangelicals.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.387
Massacre complete.

13:25.471 --> 13:29.183
I am so shocked and sorry
by what's happened.

13:29.266 --> 13:32.144
I had no idea some
lighthearted roasting

13:32.228 --> 13:35.105
would reveal such
character damnation.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.315
My bad.

13:36.398 --> 13:37.900
Do not apologize!

13:37.983 --> 13:41.237
A party mixed
with presents,
a toast, roasts,

13:41.320 --> 13:43.197
a Nazi, and sizzling gossip?

13:43.280 --> 13:45.741
Hands down, weirdest
and best birthday ever!

13:45.824 --> 13:46.909
Thanks, Santa.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.077
Now let's get
to the moment

13:48.160 --> 13:50.079
we've all been
waiting for, shall we?

13:50.162 --> 13:52.498
Ah-ha.
Ah-ha!

13:52.581 --> 13:55.459
Important people
of Santa Inc.!

13:55.543 --> 13:59.380
The coal miners are
the unsung heroes
of Santa Inc.,

13:59.463 --> 14:02.675
and we are treated
like shit by you,

14:02.758 --> 14:07.263
so tonight we sing
to you of our plight.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.847
♪ Coal mines make me sick ♪

14:08.931 --> 14:10.391
♪ But not sick like my dick ♪

14:10.474 --> 14:12.226
Stop it!
Grandpa, Tony,

14:12.309 --> 14:15.563
you're ruining this party!
Nobody cares about coal!

14:15.646 --> 14:17.481
Candy!
How could you?

14:17.565 --> 14:19.441
You're a coal
miner's daughter!

14:19.525 --> 14:21.151
Poppin' out of a cake!

14:21.235 --> 14:23.237
Happy Birthday, Big Guy!

14:23.320 --> 14:24.530
Santa and The Board,

14:24.613 --> 14:27.741
you all have coal dust
on your hands!

14:27.825 --> 14:30.661
Wow, this is a lot--

14:30.744 --> 14:32.663
-Guest 1: Oh my god!
-Call 911!

14:32.746 --> 14:34.582
Guest 2:
We better not get
blamed for this shit.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.126
-Guest 3: I was in the Bahamas.
-Oh my god.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.587
Essential services
is down because
of the blizzard.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.130
-What about the sleigh?
-Oh shit!

14:41.213 --> 14:43.465
-I'm having it renovated.
-What do we do?

14:45.676 --> 14:47.469
Follow me!

14:47.553 --> 14:50.472
-(panting)
-(intense music plays)

14:50.556 --> 14:53.726
I got you, Santa.
I got you.

14:53.809 --> 14:54.810
Oh God.

14:54.893 --> 14:55.978
Fat Man is
in the building!

14:56.061 --> 14:57.646
10 cc's of eggnog, stat!

14:57.730 --> 15:00.357
Oh god.
Please save Santa.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.318
(grunting)

15:05.863 --> 15:08.157
♪ ♪

15:16.248 --> 15:18.083
Candy:
He's the strongest
person there is.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.752
There's no way
he won't be okay.

15:19.835 --> 15:23.213
I think what would help
Santa now is the love
of my new BFF.

15:23.297 --> 15:24.965
I'm talkin'
about Christ.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.383
My boy J.C.!

15:26.467 --> 15:29.261
Accept Jesus into your
life with this baptism!

15:29.345 --> 15:31.847
Save your soul
and Santa's life.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.724
-Get off of her!
-Dr. Fruitcake: Mrs. Claus,

15:33.807 --> 15:35.684
I have some good news
and some bad news.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.854
-The good news is,
Santa is in stable condition.
-(all sigh with relief)

15:38.937 --> 15:40.648
The bad news is,
the stable condition,

15:40.731 --> 15:42.733
-is a medically induced coma.
-(all gasp)

15:42.816 --> 15:44.735
Which is actually good news
because it gives us time

15:44.818 --> 15:48.364
-to prepare for a very lengthy
and complicated surgery.
-(all sigh with relief)

15:48.447 --> 15:49.948
-Which is bad news.
-(all gasp)

15:50.032 --> 15:52.368
Because I won't
be home for dinner
and it's lasagna night,

15:52.451 --> 15:57.206
and, I, like a certain
feline named Garfield,
live for lasagna,

15:57.289 --> 16:00.959
but I guess that's
just bad news for me.

16:03.545 --> 16:07.466
All right, we have no choice
but to enact Article Seven,

16:07.549 --> 16:10.761
Subsection B of
the North Pole Edict:

16:11.470 --> 16:12.429
(clears throat)

16:12.513 --> 16:14.598
"When a Santa
becomes incapacitated,

16:14.682 --> 16:16.225
"and cannot carry
out his duties,

16:16.308 --> 16:19.353
the Board must anoint
an Acting Santa."

16:19.436 --> 16:21.730
Now, normally this
would be the Successor,

16:21.814 --> 16:23.941
but since Santa's
been stringing us along

16:24.024 --> 16:26.151
like he's in
a filthy reality show,

16:26.235 --> 16:30.322
we are obligated to go
with the highest-ranking
member of Santa Inc.,

16:30.406 --> 16:32.574
which, in this case,
would be...

16:32.658 --> 16:35.452
-(patriotic music plays)
-I, Candy Smalls,
do solemnly swear

16:35.536 --> 16:39.248
to honor all the traditions
and spirit of Christmas...

16:39.331 --> 16:43.544
and will to the best
of my abilities
preserve and protect...

16:45.337 --> 16:46.588
Jingle Jim:
Well, well, well,

16:46.672 --> 16:49.508
if it isn't the first Santa
who pees sitting down.

16:49.591 --> 16:52.511
Ha, ha.
Is there any update
on Santa's condition?

16:52.594 --> 16:54.471
Is he, is he dead?

16:54.555 --> 16:57.558
-He's still in surgery.
-Oh! We did it!

16:57.641 --> 17:00.602
Yeah!
Y'all a bunch of ugly losers!

17:00.686 --> 17:02.479
And me and Candy,
but mostly me,

17:02.563 --> 17:05.441
are a couple
of sexy-ass winners!

17:05.524 --> 17:07.735
Enough, Jeremy.
You're lazy and entitled,

17:07.818 --> 17:10.154
and I thought you'd
grow up and change,
but you haven't.

17:10.237 --> 17:11.447
So, you're fired.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.615
Wha-- Candy!

17:13.699 --> 17:16.160
How can you do that to me?

17:16.243 --> 17:17.453
Wait, do I get unemployment?

17:17.536 --> 17:21.039
Because if I do, whatever,
but if I don't, you suck!

17:21.123 --> 17:23.417
Ah, there you are!
It's Cookie.
She went into labor.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.461
Craig texted me,
and said something
went wrong.

17:25.544 --> 17:28.005
Girl Santa on the move.
Girl Santa on the move.

17:28.088 --> 17:31.300
Mm, mm, mm.
This whole thing sucks.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.469
I'm sorry
the coffee's so bad.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.263
-I hate hospitals.
-Oh, me too.

17:36.346 --> 17:38.223
You know, uh, when
I was getting divorced,

17:38.307 --> 17:40.893
I read something about how,
at the end of the day,

17:40.976 --> 17:43.353
we just need to tuck our
worries under the pillow,

17:43.437 --> 17:45.105
and have faith that,
by morning,

17:45.189 --> 17:46.482
they'll all float away.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.233
That's from
the Tooth Fairy's memoir,

17:48.317 --> 17:49.651
"Beneath the Pillow."

17:49.735 --> 17:52.154
I just read that!
That's what my costume is!

17:52.237 --> 17:54.490
Oh yeah.
That's right.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.867
Is she just so darn
impressive or what?

17:56.950 --> 17:59.828
Really, the Tooth Fairy's
the only self-made woman

17:59.912 --> 18:01.455
in the whole
holiday industry.

18:01.538 --> 18:04.958
She really is.
If only all of us
could have...

18:05.042 --> 18:07.377
that woman's
courage, I--

18:09.004 --> 18:12.382
I'm sorry.
I should probably go.

18:12.466 --> 18:15.385
Well, uh, hey,
if there's ever
anything you need,

18:15.469 --> 18:18.096
you just knock
on the door of
the Thirsty Deer,

18:18.180 --> 18:19.473
and I'll be there.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.851
Cookie, are you okay?

18:22.935 --> 18:25.854
Aw, my friends.
I have sad news.

18:25.938 --> 18:29.942
I gave birth to a seven-pound
six-ounce honey-baked ham.

18:30.025 --> 18:32.069
It was
a hysterical
pregnancy.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.695
Symone was a ham!

18:33.779 --> 18:35.864
So, you're okay?
Good. What a relief.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.283
But, hey, did you hear?
I'm Acting Santa!

18:38.367 --> 18:42.037
How cool is that?
Ho, ho, ho. Ha!

18:42.120 --> 18:43.580
I mean, hopefully,
he'll be fine.

18:43.664 --> 18:44.706
Fuck, I'm hungry.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.416
Hm, and so insensitive.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.960
What does that mean?
An elf can't eat

18:48.043 --> 18:49.878
a big hunk
of rye bread anymore?

18:49.962 --> 18:51.505
You flaked on the baby shower,

18:51.588 --> 18:53.882
before we found out
it was a ham shower,

18:53.966 --> 18:55.717
but it was still
a big event for her.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.512
You're talking about
being there for Cookie's
life moments?

18:58.595 --> 19:00.222
You fucked the best man
at her wedding.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.015
So what?
That happens
all the time.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.225
During the ceremony?

19:03.308 --> 19:05.435
My mother still cries
when she talks about it.

19:05.519 --> 19:08.355
I'm just saying, I've always
been there for both of you,

19:08.438 --> 19:11.942
and now if I'm, maybe,
being a little bit self-focused,

19:12.025 --> 19:14.528
I would, you know, think
you would give me a pass.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.697
We've given you
a lot of passes lately.

19:16.780 --> 19:19.241
And, Candy, I saw your
face during that roast...

19:19.324 --> 19:22.327
You were so vicious.
I didn't even recognize you.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.496
Ms. Smalls,
there's an update
on Santa's condition.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.332
Oh my god, is he dead?!
I mean, is he okay? Is he well?

19:27.416 --> 19:30.085
-Unknown.
-I gotta go.
I'll check in later.

19:30.168 --> 19:33.172
And then, like,
after three years,
she fires me.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.423
It's so unfair.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.800
If anything,
I deserve a raise
and my own assistant.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.427
You agree, right?

19:38.510 --> 19:40.304
Have you even been
listening to me?

19:40.387 --> 19:43.849
My last words are...
(gasps for air)

19:43.932 --> 19:47.144
you seem super-entitled.

19:47.227 --> 19:49.146
-(flatline)
-(family cries)

19:49.229 --> 19:51.690
Um, not sure
which one of you
that was for,

19:51.773 --> 19:53.108
but I hope you
learn from this.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.651
It was a mild heart arrhythmia.

19:54.735 --> 19:55.611
Mrs. Claus is with him.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.279
So, he's really
gonna be okay?

19:57.362 --> 19:59.281
Yes!
Why do you all
look so alarmed?

19:59.364 --> 20:01.199
Because you're
covered in
old blood!

20:01.283 --> 20:02.201
It's just chocolate.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.869
One of the nurses
brought brownies.

20:03.952 --> 20:05.579
But I'm afraid those
delicious treats

20:05.662 --> 20:08.123
have zero percent
chance of survival.

20:08.206 --> 20:11.877
As soon as Santa recovers,
he must name a Successor.

20:14.212 --> 20:17.799
And Devin
just kept going
through the snow

20:17.883 --> 20:19.009
until he
got you here.

20:19.092 --> 20:21.219
You know, he's big,
but he doesn't seem strong.

20:21.303 --> 20:24.806
I guess it's like
when a mom lifts a van
off her baby, you know?

20:24.890 --> 20:27.935
Like, he saw me,
his hero, in trouble,

20:28.018 --> 20:29.978
and... he just
Hulked the fuck out.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.981
Santa!
I'm so glad you're okay.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.693
I guess it's true what they say,
your heart is way too big.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.362
It wasn't his heart.

20:38.445 --> 20:41.573
Um... his lap
implants burst,

20:41.657 --> 20:43.325
which led to sepsis.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.202
I thought the implants
were indestructible,

20:45.285 --> 20:47.996
like part titanium
and part dinosaur
or something.

20:48.080 --> 20:52.209
I did, too, but I guess it
just took a special situation
to break them down.

20:52.292 --> 20:55.003
You see, Candy, earlier today
I was going down on Mrs. Claus,

20:55.087 --> 20:58.048
-cunnilingus--
-She doesn't need
this information!

20:58.131 --> 20:59.633
No, no, she does,
and it's fine.

20:59.716 --> 21:00.884
Look, Candy, it's just that,

21:00.968 --> 21:02.511
to get my tongue
at the right angle,

21:02.594 --> 21:03.971
I have to spread
my legs like a dog,

21:04.054 --> 21:07.724
-like lying on a rug kinda--
-This is so humiliating.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.142
(awkward laughter)

21:11.436 --> 21:13.689
(Candy laughs)

21:13.772 --> 21:16.191
(laughs)
Ho, ho, ho!

21:16.274 --> 21:18.276
Santa:
Man of the hour.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.736
Come on in.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.363
For carrying me all that way,

21:21.446 --> 21:27.244
I can only say with the deepest
and most sincere gratitude,

21:27.327 --> 21:29.705
I fuckin' owe you, brah.

21:29.788 --> 21:31.581
Just happy I could help.

21:31.665 --> 21:33.041
Hey, I know
it's late, but...

21:33.125 --> 21:35.210
I've got some
special visitors.

21:35.293 --> 21:37.004
(all laughing)

21:37.087 --> 21:38.547
Come on,
you little rascal.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.465
What did you
guys wanna say?

21:40.549 --> 21:42.342
Kids:
Get well soon, Santa!

21:42.426 --> 21:44.302
That was better
than any medicine.

21:44.386 --> 21:47.347
Except for
the medicine of morphine,

21:47.431 --> 21:49.224
which is...
much better.

21:49.307 --> 21:51.351
All right, people!
Santa needs to rest.

21:51.435 --> 21:52.853
Party's over.
Outta here.

21:52.936 --> 21:54.896
-Skedaddle. Shoo, shoo.
-Ooh, an elf.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.149
-I like your ears.
-No! I-- Don't touch my ears!

21:57.232 --> 21:58.900
They're sensitive!
Stop it! No!

21:58.984 --> 22:01.987
Bad kid! Easy, easy. Ahh!

22:02.070 --> 22:03.739
Let go of me on
the count of three.

22:03.822 --> 22:06.908
One, two--
Aah! Stop it! Ow!

22:06.992 --> 22:09.286
-Kid: Get over here, shorty.
-Candy: F-ing stop!

22:09.369 --> 22:13.415
Ugh, what a fucking night.
Oh god, now it's even worse.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.083
We're goin' to stay
with Uncle Ding Dong,

22:15.167 --> 22:17.586
even though he
has a mink farm
in his living room.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.254
It's better than
staying with you,

22:19.337 --> 22:20.213
‘cause you're the worst.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.132
I will not sleep
in this house

22:22.215 --> 22:24.384
for one more night
with a traitor!

22:24.468 --> 22:25.761
Well,
I totally agree!

22:25.844 --> 22:28.638
I was just coming home
to kick you guys out!

22:28.722 --> 22:31.725
I can't believe the shit
you pulled at Santa's party!

22:31.808 --> 22:33.060
You're the traitors!

22:33.143 --> 22:34.936
-(knock on window)
-Snowman: Candy,

22:35.020 --> 22:36.938
I finally found you.

22:37.022 --> 22:40.067
-Snowie?
-I've been sitting in
Santa's office so long,

22:40.150 --> 22:41.902
I lost my sense
of direction.

22:41.985 --> 22:43.779
But I have
to tell you,

22:43.862 --> 22:46.740
yesterday,
I heard Santa say

22:46.823 --> 22:49.576
who he's choosing
as a Successor.

22:49.659 --> 22:51.036
Crazy, right?

22:51.119 --> 22:53.330
Yes, crazy,
and a name, please?

22:53.413 --> 22:55.791
Oh my gosh,
I forgot to say.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.667
I've been in that
globe so long,

22:57.751 --> 22:59.836
my social skills
are a bit cloudy.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.880
Goddammit,
Snowie, who is it?

23:01.963 --> 23:04.007
Santa's choosing you!

23:04.091 --> 23:06.426
Now I'm going
to make up
for lost time.

23:06.510 --> 23:09.679
I've been craving
a cobb salad
for 17 years.

23:09.763 --> 23:14.059
(screaming)
Wah!

23:14.935 --> 23:17.145
I did it. I won.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.397
I'm going down in history.

23:19.481 --> 23:23.068
Everybody's a sucker but me!

23:25.320 --> 23:28.865
You just can't get a good
cobb salad in a snow globe.

23:28.949 --> 23:33.286
-Gotcha, ya icy bastard!
-Ahh! No!

23:39.584 --> 23:41.753
(toys whirring)

23:44.214 --> 23:47.300
(joyful music playing)
