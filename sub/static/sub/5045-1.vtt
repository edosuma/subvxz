WEBVTT

00:00.162 --> 00:02.395
She's found us.

00:02.862 --> 00:06.195
And I thought it was just to hurt Aidan,
but it's more than that.

00:06.299 --> 00:08.733
She wants to be him.

00:08.835 --> 00:12.464
And she wants
to live for real this time.

00:19.946 --> 00:24.110
You tell me,
who can help me?

00:24.217 --> 00:25.514
Who?

00:25.618 --> 00:27.609
I'm sure there's a rational...

00:27.720 --> 00:30.348
You take his picture
and tell me why she's in it.

00:30.456 --> 00:32.788
- Rachel.
- You take his picture.

00:32.892 --> 00:35.759
It's proof that he's what?
He's got a ghost inside him?

00:36.663 --> 00:40.565
No. The proof is what will happen.

00:51.377 --> 00:56.713
Aidan, you said Samara
couldn't hear us when we sleep.

00:58.051 --> 01:01.111
Well, you're sleeping now.

01:03.423 --> 01:06.256
Tell me how to stop her, honey.

01:07.527 --> 01:09.427
Tell me how to help you.

01:09.529 --> 01:12.623
Just tell me, I'll do anything, I swear.

02:28.408 --> 02:30.103
Ms. Keller?

02:32.478 --> 02:35.311
Hello, I'm Dr. Emma Temple.

02:35.415 --> 02:39.715
I'm a consulting physician
at County Child Services.

02:39.819 --> 02:42.686
Well, I was hoping to speak
with Aidan when he wakes up.

02:45.792 --> 02:48.283
Is everything all right in here?

02:48.394 --> 02:50.919
Yeah. It's fine.
Thank you.

02:51.030 --> 02:54.898
I was hoping to speak with you as well.
It's Rachel, isn't it?

02:55.001 --> 02:59.131
Yeah, about his situation.

02:59.238 --> 03:02.230
I'm sorry, what kind of doctor
did you say you were again?

03:02.341 --> 03:04.002
I'm a psychiatrist.

03:04.110 --> 03:09.207
Yeah. I spoke with a Dr...

03:09.315 --> 03:12.148
...Koji in Seattle.
Aidars doctor.

03:12.251 --> 03:14.742
Look, if we could maybe talk later.

03:14.854 --> 03:20.383
Right. Dr. Koji mentioned
that you dealt with some PPD

03:20.493 --> 03:22.688
when Aidan was born.

03:22.795 --> 03:24.262
Postpartum depression.

03:24.363 --> 03:26.331
That was the first month.
That's all.

03:26.432 --> 03:28.866
I understand.
It's very common.

03:28.968 --> 03:33.234
I mean, a lot of women have trouble
adapting to the stresses of motherhood.

03:33.339 --> 03:37.935
What does this have to do with
what's going on with my son right now?

03:38.044 --> 03:41.480
Have you been under stress lately?

03:41.581 --> 03:45.142
Have you ever found that you were...

03:45.251 --> 03:48.550
...unable to experience love for Aidan?

03:48.654 --> 03:52.317
- What?
- Have you hurt him,

03:52.425 --> 03:53.915
however unintentionally?

03:54.026 --> 03:56.722
Have you left him alone?
Abandoned him?

03:56.829 --> 04:00.890
I'd like to be with my son,
please, if you don't mind.

04:02.969 --> 04:05.267
Yeah, of course.

04:06.472 --> 04:08.804
I'm sorry, Rachel.

04:12.111 --> 04:17.481
Until we can talk further,
I cannot let you be alone with him.

04:18.651 --> 04:20.084
I'm his mother.

04:21.587 --> 04:24.784
There are bruises on his body.

04:24.891 --> 04:27.917
He was hypothermic
and very near death.

04:28.027 --> 04:30.188
That is not because of me.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.894
He's gonna be all right, Rachel.
He will.

04:37.003 --> 04:39.801
But you need to leave.

04:40.239 --> 04:42.207
Now, please.

04:47.947 --> 04:51.314
You can't have him, Samara.

04:51.851 --> 04:55.218
You're going back
to where you came from.

05:01.694 --> 05:03.753
We'll talk in here.

05:03.863 --> 05:05.888
It really will help.

05:05.998 --> 05:09.024
Sharing one's troubles
never hurt anybody.

05:10.303 --> 05:13.101
- Now, are you a coffee drinker?
- Black.

05:13.205 --> 05:16.140
Yeah, I imagined so.

05:37.797 --> 05:40.459
Dr. Forrest, dial 118, please.

05:40.566 --> 05:43.729
Dr. Forrest, please dial 118.

06:04.023 --> 06:06.184
Let's call the doctor in Seattle.

06:06.292 --> 06:08.692
I want to know just how bad
her postpartum got.

06:08.794 --> 06:10.625
- Yes.
- Thank you.

06:13.866 --> 06:15.390
The mother is missing.

06:15.501 --> 06:17.093
I want a watch on this room.

06:17.203 --> 06:20.297
She returns, she is not allowed in.

06:20.406 --> 06:23.102
Okay, Dr. Temple.

06:59.512 --> 07:02.447
All I wanna know is
her history before the Morgans.

07:02.548 --> 07:05.312
I'm sorry,
but the privacy laws still apply.

07:05.418 --> 07:08.945
Well, was she really adopted?
Can you at least tell me that much?

07:09.055 --> 07:10.545
Was their story true?

07:10.656 --> 07:14.752
- Samara Morgan was adopted, yes.
- But you won't tell me from who?

07:15.428 --> 07:18.795
- I'd lose my job if I did.
- Look, ma'am,

07:18.898 --> 07:22.664
my son has a medical condition
that his doctors don't even understand.

07:22.768 --> 07:24.929
This little girl had the same condition.

07:25.037 --> 07:29.440
Now, if I knew what caused that,
it could save his life.

07:29.542 --> 07:33.535
All I can say is you should speak
to the Morgans.

07:33.646 --> 07:37.548
They're dead.
They both killed themselves.

09:08.874 --> 09:12.002
Whoa! Look out.
Early birds.

09:12.111 --> 09:14.409
Marty Savide,
Stevens Northwest Realty.

09:14.513 --> 09:16.913
- Hi.
- Come in.

09:17.016 --> 09:20.474
I thought I put 12:30 on the ad.
For the open house.

09:20.586 --> 09:23.111
- How'd you get around the gate?
- Well, I just...

09:23.222 --> 09:24.712
Who cares? Come on.

09:24.824 --> 09:28.885
Make me an offer
over asking and it's yours.

09:28.994 --> 09:31.258
Okay, then, don't mind me.

09:31.797 --> 09:34.265
My first try with these things,
took off flying.

09:37.036 --> 09:38.970
There we go.

09:39.071 --> 09:40.971
What do you think?

09:42.474 --> 09:45.102
A little color will really
turn the place around.

09:45.211 --> 09:47.042
It's got a wonderful history.

09:47.146 --> 09:49.205
Working horse ranch.
How about that?

09:49.315 --> 09:54.218
And there's even this cute little
tree house thing way up in the barn.

09:54.320 --> 09:58.814
Is the place being sold
unfurnished or...?

09:58.924 --> 10:01.620
The previous owners
didn't leave anything behind?

10:01.727 --> 10:07.359
Well, there were some things
that were left, after they...

10:07.466 --> 10:08.592
...moved.

10:08.701 --> 10:13.434
- We're storing that in the basement.
- There's a basement?

10:15.407 --> 10:17.637
Well, you betcha.
No extra charge.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.711
Right this way.

10:30.389 --> 10:32.550
If you don't mind,
I'm the welcome wagon.

10:32.658 --> 10:34.785
Gotta open up the gate
for everyone else.

10:34.894 --> 10:36.862
So please,
make yourself at home.

10:36.962 --> 10:41.456
Do you know what happened to them?
The previous owners?

10:41.567 --> 10:43.831
I believe they bought
a condo in Phoenix.

10:43.936 --> 10:45.233
Really?

14:10.709 --> 14:13.644
Her mother.

14:49.414 --> 14:51.644
Oh, my.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.945
You're awake.

15:09.635 --> 15:09.726
I'll take it from here.

15:17.943 --> 15:20.605
Hello, Aidan, I'm Dr. Temple.

15:20.712 --> 15:24.045
How are you feeling?

15:29.955 --> 15:33.823
You know,
I'd really like to help you.

15:33.926 --> 15:37.123
Can you tell me how you're feeling?

15:38.630 --> 15:40.757
Where's my mommy?

15:40.866 --> 15:44.563
Well, she'll be here soon.
She's on her way.

15:44.670 --> 15:47.264
I want Mommy.

15:47.372 --> 15:51.672
Yeah, I know you do.
Your mommy wants to be with you too.

15:52.344 --> 15:55.074
So where is she?

15:55.347 --> 15:56.905
She went home.

15:57.015 --> 15:59.779
She didn't think that you
were gonna wake up so soon.

15:59.885 --> 16:01.580
I wanna go home too.

16:01.687 --> 16:04.053
Well, you will.

16:04.156 --> 16:08.149
We just have to...
We just have to get you...

16:12.064 --> 16:14.123
You're freezing.

16:15.434 --> 16:17.698
I wanna go home to Mommy.

16:19.838 --> 16:23.433
Well, we need to talk about her.

16:23.542 --> 16:26.443
Can you tell me
about Mommy a little bit?

16:28.013 --> 16:30.811
She loves me.

16:30.916 --> 16:32.884
I know that she does.

16:32.985 --> 16:37.615
She went looking for me.
She tried to find me.

16:37.723 --> 16:40.817
It means she loves me.

16:41.593 --> 16:43.185
I don't understand.

16:46.665 --> 16:48.360
Can I go home now?

16:50.369 --> 16:53.202
No, honey,
you're not well enough.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.639
Can I go home?

16:59.378 --> 17:00.936
No.

17:08.920 --> 17:11.080
I'm sorry.

17:19.498 --> 17:22.626
Then I have to show you something.

18:20.192 --> 18:21.989
It won't stop.

19:06.204 --> 19:09.731
I'm gonna walk you
just around the corner here.

19:37.836 --> 19:40.828
Hi, I'm Sister Diane.
How can we help you?

19:40.939 --> 19:44.375
I need to know about a child
who was born here.

19:44.476 --> 19:48.936
Is there anyone that can talk to me
who's been here more than 30 years?

19:49.047 --> 19:50.912
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

20:33.358 --> 20:36.122
I remember this, yes.

20:36.228 --> 20:39.459
A young girl made it.
Sixteen.

20:39.564 --> 20:42.397
She was shy, quiet...

20:44.269 --> 20:46.396
...beautiful.
- She stayed here?

20:46.505 --> 20:49.167
- Yes.
- Did she have her baby here?

20:49.274 --> 20:52.266
- Yes.
- And you arranged for the adoption?

20:52.377 --> 20:54.709
- That's right.
- Who was she?

21:02.420 --> 21:05.753
She was picked up wandering the streets
and brought to us.

21:06.958 --> 21:09.950
She was from some little town
up in the mountains.

21:12.163 --> 21:16.099
She said she'd been sent away
to live with relatives in the city.

21:16.201 --> 21:18.931
But no relatives were ever found.

21:23.508 --> 21:26.033
Her name was Evelyn.

21:26.745 --> 21:30.078
She came to us
eight months pregnant.

21:30.181 --> 21:33.582
- And the father?
- There was none.

21:36.488 --> 21:38.649
Half the mothers
that come to us say that.

21:38.857 --> 21:41.382
So, what did she think
got her pregnant?

21:42.260 --> 21:45.889
She wasrt well. She had been having
problems during the pregnancy:

21:45.997 --> 21:48.465
Hallucinations, visions.

21:48.934 --> 21:52.495
She believed some thing
had come for her baby

21:52.604 --> 21:54.936
from the waters of the world
beyond this one.

21:55.040 --> 21:57.270
I'm sorry.
Did you say water?

21:57.375 --> 22:02.176
Well, we all envision
the afterlife differently.

22:02.280 --> 22:07.217
For Evelyn,
it's just what she believed.

22:07.319 --> 22:11.415
As you might imagine, she suffered
severe postpartum depression.

22:11.523 --> 22:14.720
She blamed her troubles on her child.

22:14.826 --> 22:17.727
So she tried to kill it.

22:23.401 --> 22:26.234
All babies are a challenge.

22:26.338 --> 22:30.798
But Samara, she never cried.

22:30.909 --> 22:32.843
Never.

22:32.944 --> 22:35.378
Except when her mother
would try to bathe her.

22:35.480 --> 22:39.507
Then she'd scream
like it was the end of the world.

22:44.689 --> 22:47.249
It was the screaming that woke us.

22:54.833 --> 22:57.734
Evelyn, don't!

23:02.974 --> 23:04.999
Evelyn!

23:05.110 --> 23:06.873
Evelyn, stop!

23:20.158 --> 23:22.285
She was trying to drown the baby.

23:22.394 --> 23:27.354
The baby was taken from her, of course.
Evelyn was institutionalized.

23:27.465 --> 23:33.301
And all those pictures she'd been
collecting, they finally made sense.

23:36.574 --> 23:39.304
Did she say why she did it?

23:39.711 --> 23:43.169
She felt she had
to kill her baby to save it.

24:43.374 --> 24:45.842
I'm here to see a patient.
Her name's Evelyn.

24:45.944 --> 24:48.538
- I don't know her last name.
- Evelyn?

24:48.646 --> 24:50.773
That's right.

24:52.817 --> 24:54.751
Evelyrs expecting you.

24:54.853 --> 24:57.344
Every few years, one of you
comes to see Evelyn.

24:57.455 --> 25:00.583
She's like a freakir patron saint
or something.

25:00.692 --> 25:03.525
Got a problem with your kid,
don't you?

25:09.367 --> 25:11.392
Something wrong?

25:11.503 --> 25:14.802
That song. I know it.

25:14.906 --> 25:16.897
Yeah. They all do.

25:23.448 --> 25:25.279
Hey, Evelyn.

25:25.383 --> 25:29.319
You were right as rain.
You got a visitor today.

25:29.420 --> 25:31.945
Hope she's some help
to your troubles.

25:32.056 --> 25:34.081
Ten minutes.

25:39.998 --> 25:42.660
My name's Rachel.

25:43.301 --> 25:45.360
But you know that.

25:50.942 --> 25:54.173
Some days I sort of have a feeling.

25:55.413 --> 25:57.677
A feeling?

25:57.782 --> 26:00.546
This is about your child.

26:04.656 --> 26:05.645
It's...

26:08.059 --> 26:10.755
It's about yours.

26:10.862 --> 26:12.830
Samara.

26:20.371 --> 26:22.771
They don't dream, you know.

26:23.908 --> 26:26.001
The dead don't dream.

26:30.014 --> 26:32.175
Look, something's happened to my son.

26:32.283 --> 26:35.309
- You have to sleep to dream.
- It has to do with your daughter.

26:35.420 --> 26:37.445
And the dead never sleep.

26:37.555 --> 26:38.817
They wait...

26:40.491 --> 26:45.224
...and watch for a way back.

26:45.330 --> 26:46.888
But they never sleep.

26:48.233 --> 26:51.134
- That's why dreams are safe.
- I'm sorry, I just...

26:51.236 --> 26:54.899
I don't have a lot of time.
Please, I need your help.

26:55.006 --> 26:57.133
I have to know.
Can you tell me?

26:58.910 --> 27:01.140
Why did you try to kill your baby?

27:03.281 --> 27:05.215
Why?

27:06.851 --> 27:08.819
Because my baby told me to.

27:10.121 --> 27:12.316
Just like yours will tell you.

27:12.423 --> 27:15.256
And you have to do it.

27:15.827 --> 27:18.660
- You have to send it back.
- What?

27:24.636 --> 27:26.831
They stopped me.

27:28.006 --> 27:31.373
- Don't let them stop you.
- What?

27:33.077 --> 27:35.170
Listen to the voices.

27:35.280 --> 27:40.149
- What are you talking about?
- Because it's our fault. We did it.

27:40.251 --> 27:42.481
Yes. We did it. Yes.

27:42.587 --> 27:44.555
It was you.
It was you! You did it!

27:44.656 --> 27:46.248
What did I do?

27:48.726 --> 27:51.593
Evelyn, that's enough.

27:53.064 --> 27:55.862
I love my son.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.862
Come on. It's all right.

27:59.404 --> 28:02.430
I'm sorry, ma'am,
that's enough for today.

28:03.007 --> 28:04.565
Let's go.

28:04.676 --> 28:06.837
What did I do?

28:07.712 --> 28:09.680
You let the dead get in.

28:12.250 --> 28:13.842
Let's go.

28:27.332 --> 28:29.300
What should I do?

28:31.035 --> 28:33.435
Be a good mother.

28:34.739 --> 28:37.572
Listen to your baby.

28:41.479 --> 28:43.572
Listen to your baby.

28:49.354 --> 28:51.754
Listen to your baby.

28:53.558 --> 28:55.822
Listen to your baby.

28:56.561 --> 28:58.927
Listen to your baby.

29:41.873 --> 29:43.670
Aidan?

29:47.278 --> 29:49.269
Hey.

29:52.083 --> 29:55.814
Shouldrt you...
Shouldrt you be at the hospital?

29:55.920 --> 29:58.946
No. I'm here waiting for my mommy.

29:59.057 --> 30:00.490
Okay.

30:00.591 --> 30:06.359
Well, you can't really leave
till the hospital says it's okay.

30:06.464 --> 30:09.160
You were very, very sick.

30:11.069 --> 30:13.094
You're all right now?

30:18.609 --> 30:23.239
The cable setup at my house,
the TV needs to be on channel three.

30:24.248 --> 30:27.046
She loves me.
She loves me not.

30:27.885 --> 30:29.648
Thank you, Max.

30:29.754 --> 30:31.449
Sure.

30:31.923 --> 30:35.120
She loves me!

30:35.226 --> 30:37.854
Look, Mandy!

30:39.764 --> 30:41.732
I think I'm gonna puke.

30:41.833 --> 30:44.825
Why don't you do something
productive with your life?

30:46.671 --> 30:49.572
Say, Billy,
if you like fish so much...

30:49.674 --> 30:52.006
Your mom loves you, you know.

30:52.110 --> 30:54.340
She loves you a lot.

30:58.149 --> 31:01.482
You'd tell someone
if you werert sure about that, right?

31:01.586 --> 31:05.989
Like, if she'd been
hurting you somehow.

31:07.658 --> 31:10.183
Did she ever treat you
like you're someone else?

31:10.928 --> 31:13.624
- I'm not somebody else. I'm Aidan.
- No, I know.

31:13.731 --> 31:16.097
- I know.
- We don't need anyone else.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.167
That's right.

31:17.268 --> 31:22.296
We don't need you,
that doctor or anyone else.

31:22.406 --> 31:24.306
Okay?

31:26.410 --> 31:28.378
Okay.

31:41.526 --> 31:43.585
What are you doing?

31:44.795 --> 31:47.389
I was just gonna
take a picture of you.

31:47.498 --> 31:50.331
No.

31:51.969 --> 31:53.834
- It'll be for your mom.
- No.

31:53.938 --> 31:56.998
Why not? What's wrong
with taking your picture?

31:57.108 --> 32:00.737
I'll tell you what's wrong
if you promise not to take it.

32:00.845 --> 32:03.336
But that's only if you promise.

32:03.447 --> 32:05.540
Fine. I promise.

32:14.358 --> 32:15.882
So, Aidan, what's the story?

32:36.414 --> 32:41.511
We're happy when we're sad

32:41.619 --> 32:45.020
We're always feeling sad

32:45.122 --> 32:47.215
Hello?

32:47.325 --> 32:50.817
- How are you?
- Terrible.

32:50.928 --> 32:56.889
That's why we're happy
when we're sad

33:03.407 --> 33:05.034
Max?

33:07.044 --> 33:09.035
Are you here?

33:21.092 --> 33:22.821
- You're home!
- Oh, God.

33:22.927 --> 33:26.590
What are you doing here?
I thought you were at the hospital.

33:26.697 --> 33:28.324
No. I'm here, Mommy.

33:30.868 --> 33:35.134
- What did you say?
- I said I'm here.

33:37.174 --> 33:39.199
Is Max here?

33:40.378 --> 33:41.970
No.

33:42.446 --> 33:46.041
But his coat...

33:52.323 --> 33:55.986
He went away.
You wanna watch some TV with me?

34:01.132 --> 34:06.001
I just have to get something
from the car. Okay?

34:11.775 --> 34:14.404
I love you, Mommy.

34:53.317 --> 34:55.080
Max.

35:46.137 --> 35:50.130
Goldfish must have water
in order to exist.

35:50.241 --> 35:53.472
But goldfish hate cats.

35:59.617 --> 36:03.747
While on the other hand,
cats hate water.

36:37.555 --> 36:39.648
Rachel.

36:42.193 --> 36:45.651
Are you sleeping, Rachel?

36:45.763 --> 36:49.893
I am. She makes me sleep
all the time now.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.403
- Aidan.
- Just keep sleeping, Rachel.

36:54.505 --> 36:58.066
So she can't hear us.
It's the only way.

36:58.209 --> 37:00.609
You have to show her, Rachel.

37:00.711 --> 37:02.770
Show her she can't stay.

37:02.880 --> 37:05.348
In you.

37:05.449 --> 37:09.078
How? How do I do that?

37:09.186 --> 37:11.017
Take me to where she's afraid of.

37:12.356 --> 37:15.120
You know where she's afraid of.

37:15.226 --> 37:16.921
Take me there...

37:18.395 --> 37:20.260
...and kill me.
- Aidan, no.

37:20.364 --> 37:23.299
Rachel, keep sleeping.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.595
She won't stay if she knows
you'll kill me.

37:27.271 --> 37:28.568
It's the only way.

37:28.672 --> 37:31.766
I can't do it. I can't.

37:36.313 --> 37:38.508
Then she stays.

37:40.751 --> 37:42.582
She's heard us.

38:04.408 --> 38:06.467
Honey?

38:06.577 --> 38:09.137
I thought you were sleeping, Mommy.

38:10.781 --> 38:13.807
I was, but I had a bad dream.

38:13.918 --> 38:15.579
You must've had a nightmare.

38:16.353 --> 38:20.119
It's all right.
We all have them.

38:22.326 --> 38:24.760
Will you stay with me now?

38:24.862 --> 38:28.457
- Stay?
- Stay for always.

38:31.201 --> 38:33.066
Yeah. Yeah.

38:33.170 --> 38:36.435
Alrighty.
Let's watch some TV together.

38:38.943 --> 38:41.969
It's kind of late, honey.

38:42.913 --> 38:45.438
Don't you think you should sleep?

38:49.453 --> 38:52.217
I never sleep.

38:57.728 --> 39:00.697
Then let Mommy make you something.

40:19.843 --> 40:23.108
Something wrong?
You seem sad.

40:25.149 --> 40:27.515
No, honey, I'm not sad.

40:28.986 --> 40:31.716
I'm just tired, that's all.

40:33.424 --> 40:36.120
Well, now you have me to protect you.

41:07.591 --> 41:10.924
You ain't the biggest catfish
in the deep blue sea

41:23.941 --> 41:26.409
Take me to where she's afraid of.

41:26.510 --> 41:28.535
You know where she's afraid of.

41:30.214 --> 41:32.239
You have to show her, Rachel.

41:32.349 --> 41:35.182
Show her she can't stay.

41:37.621 --> 41:41.887
Listen to the voices.
You have to listen to the voices.

41:45.796 --> 41:49.197
Be a good mother.
Be a good mother.

41:50.400 --> 41:52.766
Listen to your baby.

42:48.826 --> 42:50.384
I'm sorry.

42:51.461 --> 42:53.793
I'm so sorry.

42:55.065 --> 42:57.727
But you can't stay.

43:04.942 --> 43:08.503
What are you doing?
Rachel!

43:08.612 --> 43:10.102
What are you doing?

43:10.247 --> 43:12.078
It's me.

43:12.182 --> 43:14.548
- It's not her, Rachel.
- I know, baby.

43:14.651 --> 43:16.983
It's me.

43:17.087 --> 43:20.420
I love you.
Mommy, I love you.

43:20.524 --> 43:22.651
I know, baby.

43:24.528 --> 43:27.326
I love you too.

43:40.010 --> 43:42.604
But you're not my son.

44:20.350 --> 44:22.682
Mommy.

44:48.812 --> 44:50.370
Honey.

44:52.616 --> 44:56.108
Breathe. Baby, breathe.

44:56.219 --> 44:59.382
Please. I know it's you, honey.

45:03.126 --> 45:05.822
Aidan, please.

45:07.397 --> 45:08.830
Rachel.

45:12.703 --> 45:14.637
Yeah.

45:14.738 --> 45:17.104
I'm right here.

45:18.408 --> 45:19.739
You're okay.

45:19.843 --> 45:23.040
Everything's all right, honey.

45:26.717 --> 45:28.912
You were sleeping.

45:29.619 --> 45:32.053
You were just sleeping.

45:48.972 --> 45:51.099
No.

46:04.054 --> 46:05.954
She wants me again.

46:08.592 --> 46:10.617
No.

46:17.234 --> 46:20.670
Rachel, what are you doing?

46:22.873 --> 46:27.640
All she wants is a mother.
That's all she wants.

46:30.080 --> 46:33.914
And she'll keep coming
till she finds one.

46:34.017 --> 46:36.076
Come on!
Come back!

46:36.186 --> 46:38.552
Get away from her!
Rachel!

46:38.655 --> 46:40.714
Get away from her!

46:43.560 --> 46:46.654
You can't have my son.

46:49.499 --> 46:52.332
So take me.

46:52.436 --> 46:53.960
Rachel! No!

47:39.950 --> 47:41.349
Samara!

47:42.352 --> 47:44.843
Here I am, Samara.

47:46.823 --> 47:49.690
Just like you wanted.

47:51.962 --> 47:55.420
But you leave him alone!

47:55.532 --> 47:57.227
You hear me?

48:04.641 --> 48:06.370
Help me.

48:16.019 --> 48:18.180
It's always open.

48:19.089 --> 48:23.458
Her only way out is always open.

48:46.349 --> 48:50.945
Mommy.

49:02.165 --> 49:05.362
Mommy!

49:11.241 --> 49:14.176
Mommy.

51:08.625 --> 51:11.890
- Mommy!
- I'm not your fucking mommy.

51:32.082 --> 51:33.845
Rachel.

53:04.274 --> 53:08.040
- Can you hear me?
- I can hear you.

53:08.144 --> 53:09.372
I'm right here.

53:49.285 --> 53:51.253
You're here.

53:53.056 --> 53:56.150
- You're here, Rachel.
- Of course I'm here.

53:56.826 --> 53:59.727
I followed your voice.

54:01.865 --> 54:03.696
What happened?

54:05.969 --> 54:08.631
It's over, honey.

54:09.672 --> 54:12.300
She's not coming back.

54:12.408 --> 54:15.206
How do you know, Rachel?

54:18.114 --> 54:20.275
I know.

54:22.218 --> 54:24.118
I promise.

54:29.259 --> 54:31.193
I promise.

54:31.294 --> 54:33.888
I love you, Mommy.

54:36.232 --> 54:38.530
Promise me something?

54:38.635 --> 54:42.230
Yeah. Anything, Mom.
Anything.

54:42.338 --> 54:44.772
Just call me Rachel.

54:46.509 --> 54:48.136
At least for a while.
