00:53.709 --> 00:57.140
- Hey. Sleep any better last night?
- Not really.

00:57.306 --> 01:00.143
I ended up watching a <i>Scooby-Doo</i>
marathon on Cartoon Network.

01:00.309 --> 01:02.771
Well, did the doorbell wake you up?

01:02.937 --> 01:05.691
I didn't hear it. Who was it?

01:05.857 --> 01:08.735
He didn't say, but he's waiting
for you in your office.

01:28.110 --> 01:30.579
Can I help you?

01:32.550 --> 01:34.192
Dad.

01:34.317 --> 01:35.783
So, this is

01:36.053 --> 01:37.595
what your life has come to.

01:37.720 --> 01:41.489
Quite a... place you've made
down here for yourself.

01:41.767 --> 01:43.057
What are you doing here?

01:44.660 --> 01:46.404
I've tried to give you your space,

01:46.529 --> 01:48.358
but your behavior has become

01:48.524 --> 01:50.193
too erratic to ignore.

01:50.359 --> 01:52.195
Visiting a brothel
with your infant nephew.

01:52.676 --> 01:56.116
Taking your mentally unstable
mother on a reckless road trip.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.201
Kristen had no business
telling you about that.

01:58.367 --> 02:00.718
I don't need to depend on
your sister to keep tabs on you.

02:00.843 --> 02:03.621
She doesn't even know
your darkest secrets.

02:03.746 --> 02:06.043
But I do.

02:06.209 --> 02:10.547
Simulating sex with a stuffed giraffe
in front of an eight-year-old boy.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.648
Defecating in your neighbor's boots.

02:13.773 --> 02:16.791
- How do you know about...
- Your suicide attempt.

02:17.993 --> 02:20.262
Wilfred.

02:21.597 --> 02:23.474
What about Wilfred?

02:23.599 --> 02:25.909
It's just a dog.

02:26.034 --> 02:28.346
He can't talk to you.

02:28.471 --> 02:30.305
I know that.

02:32.341 --> 02:34.952
It's time to get honest, Ryan.

02:35.077 --> 02:37.255
I-I think you should leave.

02:37.380 --> 02:38.956
Let me help you.

02:39.081 --> 02:40.682
I don't need anything from you.

02:40.952 --> 02:43.785
I'm not the bad guy, Ryan.

02:45.873 --> 02:47.998
(gasps)

02:48.123 --> 02:50.325
(exhales)

02:57.966 --> 03:00.602
ANNE:
Hey. Sleep any better last night?

03:04.106 --> 03:06.950
Um... not really.

03:07.075 --> 03:09.320
I'm barely sleeping at all,

03:09.445 --> 03:12.122
but being awake is better than
the dreams I've been having.

03:12.247 --> 03:15.326
That's too bad.

03:15.451 --> 03:17.895
You're distracting my subject, Ryan.

03:18.020 --> 03:19.430
Sorry.

03:19.555 --> 03:21.489
Oh, I don't mind him in here.

03:21.867 --> 03:24.202
Although it is weird how
dogs like to just sit there

03:24.327 --> 03:26.628
and watch you shit.

03:30.042 --> 03:31.242
I couldn't shake the feeling

03:31.367 --> 03:33.311
that I'd actually just seen my dad.

03:33.436 --> 03:35.313
It was creepy how real it felt.

03:35.438 --> 03:37.215
I had a dream like that once.

03:37.340 --> 03:40.041
I had a dream that the nation rose up

03:40.469 --> 03:41.919
to live out its true creed,

03:42.044 --> 03:44.689
that in the state of Alabama
little black boys and girls

03:44.814 --> 03:47.725
were able to hold hands
with little white boys and girls

03:47.850 --> 03:49.627
and walk together
as brother and sister.

03:49.752 --> 03:52.196
It was creepy how real it felt.

03:52.321 --> 03:54.699
Well... whatever.

03:54.824 --> 03:57.535
I don't know why I'm dwelling
on it... it was only a dream.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.466
Dreams are meaningful, Ryan.

03:59.591 --> 04:01.105
Have you ever felt
like part of your mind

04:01.230 --> 04:02.506
is trying to tell you something?

04:02.631 --> 04:04.308
No. What's that like?

04:04.433 --> 04:05.876
It's like an intuition,

04:06.001 --> 04:08.123
like a cry for help
from your subconscious.

04:08.471 --> 04:10.047
I don't need help; I need sleep.

04:10.172 --> 04:12.182
What you need is
to listen to your gut.

04:12.307 --> 04:14.151
And speaking of guts,

04:14.276 --> 04:16.303
check out this photo of Anne.

04:16.754 --> 04:19.466
It takes guts to look
at your own wipe like that.

04:19.632 --> 04:20.192
Oh, God.

04:20.317 --> 04:23.430
Why are dogs so fascinated
by watching people shit?

04:23.596 --> 04:26.130
Because we're students, Ryan.
Students of human nature.

04:26.255 --> 04:27.732
A person's fecal expulsion technique

04:27.857 --> 04:29.561
can teach you a lot about them.

04:29.727 --> 04:31.218
Like what?

04:31.343 --> 04:33.481
Well, for example, look at Jenna.

04:33.647 --> 04:35.038
Legs crossed, hands folded,

04:35.163 --> 04:37.277
refined turd- pinching posture.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.343
She's classy.
And not just classy

04:39.468 --> 04:41.679
but a long list of synonyms
that also mean classy.

04:41.804 --> 04:43.347
WOMAN:
You're gonna make my bush look terrible.

04:43.472 --> 04:45.160
MAN:
There's not a damn thing wrong

04:45.326 --> 04:46.450
with my eyes, Margot!

04:46.575 --> 04:50.044
Yeah, well, the state
of California disagrees!

04:50.331 --> 04:51.780
Trouble in paradise.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.324
Could've told you that.

04:53.449 --> 04:56.160
She and Gene have been
having serious problems.

04:56.285 --> 04:58.215
Oh, God.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.030
- Th-That's Margot. How did you...?
- Look at her, Ryan.

05:00.155 --> 05:01.509
See the pain in her face?

05:01.675 --> 05:03.233
That's the strain of marital discord

05:03.358 --> 05:05.159
poisoning her peace of mind.

05:05.429 --> 05:06.804
Or she's just taking a shit.

05:06.929 --> 05:08.058
Beans.

05:08.224 --> 05:10.374
Beans. J-Beans.

05:10.499 --> 05:12.979
J-Bizzle.

05:13.145 --> 05:15.036
Beazy!

05:15.314 --> 05:16.647
Aw, h-he can't hear me.

05:16.772 --> 05:18.182
He must have his earbuds in.

05:18.307 --> 05:20.141
Hey, Jellybeans.

05:23.045 --> 05:25.242
Aw, cute bandana.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.925
Yeah, it's really working.

05:28.050 --> 05:30.664
Uh-oh. There he goes.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.096
Look at him. Impeccable
form of the back arch.

05:33.221 --> 05:34.765
Slightly trembling knees.

05:34.890 --> 05:36.600
Pinch-point sharp as a dagger.

05:36.725 --> 05:39.260
He's perfect and he knows it.

05:42.665 --> 05:44.636
As a doctor,

05:44.802 --> 05:46.777
ethically and legally I'm not
allowed to give these to you.

05:46.902 --> 05:49.046
So... just think of me as a sister

05:49.171 --> 05:51.449
with easy access
to really good drugs.

05:51.809 --> 05:53.186
Thank you. You're a lifesaver.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.953
Just promise me that these
will be your last resort.

05:56.078 --> 05:58.275
Try getting up
and taking a walk first.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.442
I promise.

06:03.752 --> 06:05.363
You know, you need to figure out

06:05.488 --> 06:07.188
the cause of your insomnia, Ryan.

06:07.491 --> 06:09.132
In the absence of jet lag,

06:09.875 --> 06:12.831
too much caffeine? Drug use?

06:14.665 --> 06:16.960
Okay, well,
then that just leaves stress.

06:17.126 --> 06:19.901
Well, I have been
having dreams about Dad.

06:20.171 --> 06:20.964
Mmm.

06:21.130 --> 06:22.266
Weird dreams.

06:22.635 --> 06:24.050
- Sex dreams?
- What?

06:24.216 --> 06:25.427
- No.
- Don't bite my head off.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.284
I'm just trying to help.

06:28.168 --> 06:30.268
Well, you know, maybe it's time
you two talked.

06:30.393 --> 06:32.642
- You may feel less stressed.
- I have nothing to say to him.

06:32.808 --> 06:33.935
- Ryan...
- You know what?

06:34.101 --> 06:36.229
I-I'm too exhausted to be having
this conversation right now.

06:36.395 --> 06:39.563
Come on, Wilfred. Let's go.

06:39.688 --> 06:41.832
Well, you should come over
for Sunday brunch,

06:41.957 --> 06:43.278
bring some champagne.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.196
We'll just hang out, drink mimosas.

06:45.362 --> 06:46.531
I promise not to talk about Dad.

06:46.697 --> 06:47.671
Okay.

06:47.796 --> 06:49.499
Thanks again.
I hope these work.

06:49.624 --> 06:52.142
Oh, they will.
One of those and I'm out for eight hours.

06:52.267 --> 06:54.669
Doesn't matter
how loud the baby cries.

07:02.880 --> 07:03.845
(cap pops)

07:10.930 --> 07:12.987
(crickets chirping)

07:17.159 --> 07:19.570
Do you smell it, too, Ryan?

07:19.695 --> 07:21.191
Smell what?

07:21.730 --> 07:24.566
The stench of death.

07:28.447 --> 07:30.071
(quietly):
It's over here.

07:35.343 --> 07:36.921
No, I don't sm...

07:37.046 --> 07:39.356
Whoa. I do smell something.

07:39.481 --> 07:40.758
(sniffing)

07:40.883 --> 07:43.093
That's disgusting.

07:43.912 --> 07:46.831
It's a... a hot dog from 7-Eleven.

07:46.956 --> 07:49.135
It probably fell out
of Gene's trash can.

07:49.301 --> 07:52.193
The death smell
isn't coming from that.

08:01.397 --> 08:02.536
(whispering):
It's coming from that.

08:06.405 --> 08:09.197
WILFRED (panting):
Ryan! Ryan!

08:09.363 --> 08:12.951
Ryan.
You have got to see this.

08:13.117 --> 08:15.243
Let me guess.
Mrs. Patel took a shit?

08:15.368 --> 08:17.733
No! Well, yeah.

08:17.858 --> 08:18.913
It was long and painful.

08:19.038 --> 08:21.482
It was one of those shits
that had, like, a bird beak.

08:21.607 --> 08:23.378
But that's not it.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.110
Take a look at this.

08:28.580 --> 08:29.801
It's a toilet.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.793
An empty toilet.

08:31.918 --> 08:34.597
Margot missed her 8:45 a.m. shit.

08:34.763 --> 08:36.515
She goes at 8:45 every morning

08:36.682 --> 08:38.532
so she's done in time
for the 9:00 reruns

08:38.657 --> 08:40.102
of <i>A Man Called Hawk.</i>

08:40.269 --> 08:41.869
- Maybe she went earlier.
- You don't get it.

08:41.994 --> 08:43.437
Something's happened to Margot.

08:43.562 --> 08:46.031
Now look at this.

08:47.318 --> 08:48.810
So?

08:48.935 --> 08:50.845
So, look at him.

08:51.113 --> 08:52.280
He's closing the curtains.

08:52.405 --> 08:53.700
He's hiding something.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.160
Nice try.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.078
What does that mean?

08:57.244 --> 08:58.719
I know you, Wilfred. This is...

08:58.844 --> 09:00.955
some kind of elaborate mind game
to... I don't know...

09:01.080 --> 09:02.459
get a new squeak toy.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.210
Look, I-I don't know
what you're up to,

09:04.376 --> 09:06.004
but I'm too tired to care.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.029
Look at the facts, Ryan.

09:08.154 --> 09:10.431
Gene and his wife are having
marital problems.

09:10.556 --> 09:12.533
Gene buries something
in the middle of the night.

09:12.658 --> 09:14.435
The next morning Margot is missing.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.161
Do the math.

09:16.597 --> 09:18.772
It all adds up...

09:18.897 --> 09:20.727
to murder.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.945
Yeah. That's much more likely
than an old guy doing

09:24.070 --> 09:26.914
a little late night gardening
'cause he couldn't sleep.

09:27.039 --> 09:29.616
Look, I have to get some
champagne for Kristen's brunch.

09:29.741 --> 09:31.863
I always listen to my gut, Ryan.

09:32.029 --> 09:37.535
My gut never lies and right now my gut
is telling me <i>murder.</i>

09:37.701 --> 09:39.126
Okay, I went
a little bit big on that,

09:39.251 --> 09:42.487
but the point is: murder.

09:45.992 --> 09:47.921
(exhales)

09:48.087 --> 09:50.590
Ryan, hey, thanks for coming.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.740
- You didn't bring Wilfred, did you?
- No, I-I thought...

09:52.865 --> 09:55.076
Great. Come on in.

09:55.201 --> 09:57.444
- Let's get this over with.
- Jenna?

09:57.569 --> 10:00.600
Uncle Larry?
What are you doing here?

10:00.766 --> 10:03.550
Wha... What is this?
What-What's going on?

10:03.675 --> 10:07.288
Ryan, um, we're all here
because we love you.

10:07.564 --> 10:08.733
I'll go first.

10:08.899 --> 10:09.957
Is this an intervention?

10:10.082 --> 10:12.260
Ryan, you haven't
been yourself lately.

10:12.385 --> 10:13.460
You've been avoiding me.

10:13.585 --> 10:14.781
I can't believe this shit.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.931
Look, I-I'm just tired, okay?

10:17.056 --> 10:18.232
I haven't been sleeping well.

10:18.357 --> 10:19.967
It's more serious than that.

10:20.092 --> 10:21.704
The way you've been
abusing marijuana,

10:21.870 --> 10:23.703
the bizarre attachment
you have to Wilfred.

10:23.828 --> 10:25.416
Dad thinks that when you stopped
working for him...

10:25.582 --> 10:26.774
Dad?!

10:26.899 --> 10:28.586
Wa-Was this his idea?

10:28.752 --> 10:30.811
Yes, Ryan. I asked everyone to come.

10:30.936 --> 10:33.883
I only did it because
I care about you.

10:34.049 --> 10:35.051
Since when?

10:35.217 --> 10:36.951
I've always had your
best interests at heart.

10:37.076 --> 10:39.222
- This is for your own good.
- Bullshit.

10:39.388 --> 10:41.155
I've arranged for you
to get the help you need.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.725
Dave will make sure
you get there safely.

10:42.891 --> 10:44.352
I'm not going anywhere with him.

10:44.518 --> 10:47.494
- You need help!
- No! I don't need anything from you!

10:47.619 --> 10:48.773
Oh, Ryan,

10:48.939 --> 10:50.191
I'm not the bad guy!

10:50.357 --> 10:52.569
(gasping)

10:52.791 --> 10:54.692
You're gonna want to see this.

10:56.530 --> 10:57.805
I was in Gene's front yard,

10:57.930 --> 10:59.807
going totally
ballistic on his azaleas

10:59.932 --> 11:02.310
for no reason whatsoever,
which I often do,

11:02.435 --> 11:04.378
and he chases me away.

11:04.503 --> 11:06.147
Now why do you suppose he did that?

11:06.272 --> 11:08.715
Because he likes his azaleas?

11:08.840 --> 11:10.351
Open your eyes, Ryan.

11:10.476 --> 11:12.253
He doesn't want me
digging up his wife.

11:12.378 --> 11:13.754
Give it up, Wilfred.

11:13.879 --> 11:15.489
I know you're just stringing me along

11:15.614 --> 11:16.948
because you want to get something.

11:17.384 --> 11:18.428
Is this a dream?

11:18.594 --> 11:20.685
It's Gene!

11:39.156 --> 11:40.647
(grunting)

11:40.772 --> 11:42.716
What the hell?

11:42.841 --> 11:45.752
Wilfred, for the last time,
Gene didn't kill...

11:46.038 --> 11:48.755
Is that Margot's housecoat?

11:49.041 --> 11:51.082
Covered in blood.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.463
(in cartoony voice):
Murder.

11:55.588 --> 11:58.132
Shit. I went too cartoony
with it that time.

11:58.257 --> 11:59.724
I totally overcorrected.

12:01.553 --> 12:04.348
Gene's panicked.
He's moving the body.

12:04.473 --> 12:05.711
We've got to follow him, Ryan.

12:05.836 --> 12:07.712
It's too late.
We'll never catch up.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.404
Nah, we'll definitely catch up.

12:18.216 --> 12:19.864
WILFRED:
Why did you do it, Gene?

12:20.030 --> 12:21.511
Where are you going?

12:21.636 --> 12:25.348
And why has your blinker been
on for the past ten miles?

12:25.473 --> 12:26.983
Just turn left already. Jesus.

12:27.108 --> 12:28.665
I can't believe it.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.453
Gene actually killed his wife.

12:30.578 --> 12:32.855
I told you.

12:32.980 --> 12:34.420
My gut never lies.

12:34.586 --> 12:36.381
You're a regular Scooby-Doo.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.675
(groans)
What the hell?!

12:38.841 --> 12:40.096
You called me the S-word.

12:40.221 --> 12:42.132
That's the most racist
character ever created.

12:42.257 --> 12:44.767
"Ruh-roh!"
Wh-Who talks like that?

12:44.892 --> 12:47.937
And Scooby's constant need
for Scooby Snacks.

12:48.062 --> 12:49.872
Like all dogs think about is food?

12:49.997 --> 12:51.312
It's a goddamn minstrel show!

12:51.478 --> 12:52.855
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- And in the end,

12:53.021 --> 12:54.277
every villain gets unmasked

12:54.402 --> 12:56.146
and gives a detailed confession
of his whole plan.

12:56.271 --> 12:57.813
Like Scoob couldn't have
figured it out himself

12:57.938 --> 12:59.382
'cause he's such a "ridiot."

12:59.507 --> 13:01.851
And don't even get me started
on Scooby-Dum.

13:01.976 --> 13:03.282
I'll lose my shit.

13:03.448 --> 13:05.159
Geez. I'm sorry I brought it up.

13:05.325 --> 13:06.813
So you should be.

13:07.369 --> 13:10.083
It's offensive.

13:11.519 --> 13:13.163
He's stopping.

13:13.288 --> 13:14.964
Cut the engine.
Cut the engine.

13:15.089 --> 13:16.823
(whispering):
What's he doing?

13:19.006 --> 13:21.259
What's he gonna get in the trunk?

13:21.425 --> 13:23.197
This is some freaky shit, man.

13:26.067 --> 13:28.368
There she is.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.562
(bird hooting)

13:32.728 --> 13:34.605
Oh, my God.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.095
Holy shit.

13:45.220 --> 13:47.827
No body, no murder.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.665
Oh.

13:49.790 --> 13:52.602
Now do you believe me?

13:52.727 --> 13:55.626
Wait. Wilfred! Goddamn it.

13:55.792 --> 13:59.209
Wilfred! Wilfred!

13:59.334 --> 14:01.611
What are you doing?

14:01.736 --> 14:05.115
Oh, no! Wilfred!

14:05.240 --> 14:06.583
Wilfred!

14:06.708 --> 14:08.598
Oh, no.

14:13.114 --> 14:14.715
Wilfred!

14:19.316 --> 14:21.331
(Ryan panting)

14:21.456 --> 14:23.799
What? I thought you had drowned.

14:23.924 --> 14:26.269
Nah. Just trying
to save the evidence,

14:26.394 --> 14:27.737
but I couldn't find it.

14:27.862 --> 14:29.577
Water felt good, though.

14:30.064 --> 14:31.608
(bird hooting)

14:31.733 --> 14:33.433
Um...

14:36.804 --> 14:38.181
I'm calling the cops on Gene.

14:38.306 --> 14:39.849
Listen, this was my bust.

14:39.974 --> 14:41.551
Let me make the call.
I'll do the talking.

14:41.676 --> 14:43.430
I still can't believe
that sweet old man is...

14:43.555 --> 14:45.259
- Standing on your front porch?
- What?

14:45.425 --> 14:46.594
Hello, Ryan.

14:50.597 --> 14:52.209
Hey, Gene.

14:53.165 --> 14:54.685
H-How's it going?

14:54.851 --> 14:56.771
Not too good, Ryan.

14:56.937 --> 14:58.245
Stay cool.

14:58.370 --> 15:00.525
My gut tells me
he doesn't know anything.

15:00.691 --> 15:01.818
I know you followed me.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.084
He's bluffing.

15:04.209 --> 15:07.949
Gene, you-you need
to turn yourself in.

15:08.115 --> 15:09.757
Can't you just
give me another chance?

15:09.882 --> 15:11.077
It was an accident.

15:11.243 --> 15:12.620
- You're a murderer.
- I know, but

15:12.786 --> 15:14.261
what's done is done.

15:14.386 --> 15:15.957
Can't we just pretend
it never happened?

15:16.123 --> 15:18.566
What would Margot say to that?

15:18.691 --> 15:20.501
Gene!

15:20.626 --> 15:22.046
What the hell are you doing out here?

15:22.212 --> 15:24.423
Get your wrinkly ass back to bed.

15:24.589 --> 15:26.050
Hi, Ryan.

15:26.216 --> 15:27.802
Hi, Margot.

15:29.636 --> 15:31.013
Margot can't know about this.

15:31.179 --> 15:32.680
She can't?

15:32.805 --> 15:34.782
I failed my vision test,

15:34.907 --> 15:37.603
and the DMV took my license away.

15:37.769 --> 15:40.731
If Margot finds out
I was driving, she'll kill me.

15:40.980 --> 15:43.067
See, I needed some bug spray

15:43.233 --> 15:44.492
for my azaleas.

15:44.617 --> 15:46.827
I was only gonna drive
there and back.

15:46.952 --> 15:49.824
And then this-this dog ran out of

15:49.990 --> 15:51.264
nowhere...

15:51.389 --> 15:52.700
(Gene cries)

15:52.825 --> 15:54.161
You hit a dog.

15:54.327 --> 15:55.872
Poor thing.

15:56.161 --> 15:59.306
I wrapped it in my, in
my wife's housecoat.

15:59.431 --> 16:02.545
I tried to give him a decent
burial in my backyard,

16:02.801 --> 16:06.716
but then Wilfred started
scratching at the fence,

16:06.939 --> 16:09.176
so I had to dump the body.

16:09.407 --> 16:12.252
I'll never drive again, I promise.

16:12.377 --> 16:16.183
Please don't tell Margot, hmm?

16:16.349 --> 16:18.519
Yeah. Sure.

16:18.685 --> 16:20.828
Thanks, Ryan.

16:20.953 --> 16:23.274
I appreciate it.

16:24.556 --> 16:26.858
He's bluffing.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.805
I should have taken
these two days ago.

16:31.930 --> 16:34.374
(bubbling)

16:34.499 --> 16:36.410
Those are probably sugar pills.

16:36.535 --> 16:38.378
What are you talking about?

16:38.503 --> 16:40.881
The last time Kristen gave you
meds, they were placebos,

16:41.006 --> 16:43.684
so why would she give you
the real thing this time?

16:43.809 --> 16:45.953
Yeah, but I think she trusts me now.

16:46.078 --> 16:48.455
Well, listen to your gut, I guess.

16:48.580 --> 16:51.592
(bubbling)

16:51.717 --> 16:54.161
What about your gut?

16:54.286 --> 16:58.559
You say it's always right, but
Gene killed a dog, not his wife.

17:01.093 --> 17:04.522
Yeah. I guess
we were wrong about that.

17:04.689 --> 17:06.440
<i>You</i> were wrong.

17:06.565 --> 17:08.944
My gut was telling me
you were up to something.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.655
Ryan, for the last time...

17:10.820 --> 17:12.546
A dog from the neighborhood
was killed.

17:12.671 --> 17:14.032
How could you not know that?

17:14.199 --> 17:16.035
I've been busy.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.751
Maybe.

17:17.876 --> 17:19.997
Or maybe it was a
dog you didn't like.

17:20.163 --> 17:21.722
It's a really nice day.

17:21.847 --> 17:23.792
I-I think I'm gonna go for a walk.

17:23.959 --> 17:26.587
You <i>did</i> know!
It was Jellybeans.

17:26.752 --> 17:30.731
What? You're really
reaching now, mate.

17:30.856 --> 17:34.220
Oh, yeah? Then where
did you get his bandana?

17:34.386 --> 17:37.137
Okay! You got me!

17:37.262 --> 17:40.267
I took it off Beans' body
when I dove into the river.

17:40.433 --> 17:42.476
You set up Gene to kill Jellybeans!

17:42.601 --> 17:45.178
Yes! It's true!

17:45.303 --> 17:48.649
I was over at Gene's when
I heard him and his wife

17:48.774 --> 17:50.651
arguing about his eyesight.

17:50.776 --> 17:52.419
When he decided to ignore his wife

17:52.544 --> 17:55.623
and drive to get bug spray,
I knew exactly what to do.

17:55.748 --> 17:58.291
I knew Jellybeans had a weakness
for bouncing tennis balls,

17:58.416 --> 18:01.288
so I tossed one in
front of Gene's car.

18:01.454 --> 18:04.364
He never knew what hit him.

18:04.489 --> 18:06.900
It was the perfect plan.

18:07.025 --> 18:09.026
And I would have gotten
away with it, too,

18:09.337 --> 18:11.257
if it weren't for you meddling kid!

18:11.596 --> 18:13.707
You killed Jellybeans
for his bandana.

18:13.832 --> 18:15.720
You're a monster.

18:16.001 --> 18:18.045
I did it because of you, Ryan.

18:18.170 --> 18:19.947
You drove me to it.

18:20.072 --> 18:23.894
The way you went on and
on about that bandana!

18:24.060 --> 18:26.147
- I said it was cute.
- Exactly.

18:26.411 --> 18:29.483
What was I supposed to do...
not kill him for his bandana?

18:29.649 --> 18:31.983
(phone buzzing)

18:33.518 --> 18:35.829
"Don't forget the champagne."

18:35.954 --> 18:37.665
Shit. Kristen's brunch.

18:37.790 --> 18:39.910
I totally forgot.

18:40.076 --> 18:41.902
I don't have time to deal with this.

18:42.027 --> 18:45.207
Oh, God, I took those sleeping pills.

18:45.373 --> 18:47.877
That's okay. The mimosa will
take the edge off. Let's go.

18:48.043 --> 18:51.111
You're not invited.
I knew you were up to something.

18:51.236 --> 18:53.257
You're missing the point,
Ryan, as usual.

18:53.605 --> 18:55.342
Oh, really?
What's the point?

18:55.674 --> 18:58.485
Your gut was right about me,
but you ignored it.

18:58.610 --> 19:01.121
You <i>keep</i> ignoring it.

19:01.246 --> 19:03.309
It's reaching out to you
from your subconscious,

19:03.475 --> 19:05.352
through your dreams.

19:05.518 --> 19:07.271
You should listen to it.

19:07.437 --> 19:10.441
There's nothing to listen to.

19:24.970 --> 19:27.071
MAN:
Ryan?

19:37.316 --> 19:39.929
It's good to see you.

19:41.954 --> 19:44.141
What are you doing here?

19:44.307 --> 19:45.899
Grocery shopping.

19:46.024 --> 19:48.229
Maria has the weekend off.
I needed a few things.

19:48.395 --> 19:51.023
This is a dream.

19:51.189 --> 19:52.472
Are you okay?

19:52.597 --> 19:53.907
Go away.

19:54.192 --> 19:55.442
Now, come on, Ryan.

19:55.567 --> 19:57.822
I think this has gone
on long enough. Oh!

19:58.203 --> 19:59.490
Jesus, Ryan, what is wrong with you?

19:59.905 --> 20:01.909
- It's okay. He's my son.
- I'm fine!

20:02.075 --> 20:03.577
None of this is real.
You're not real.

20:03.808 --> 20:05.518
- You need help.
- I don't need help!

20:05.643 --> 20:08.916
You're not real.
None of this is real!

20:09.214 --> 20:11.710
Ryan! Ryan!
