WEBVTT

00:02.335 --> 00:04.135
Listen, Greg, I've got
the next big reality show.

00:04.203 --> 00:05.737
We put a bunch of people
on a plane,

00:05.805 --> 00:07.372
fly them over the Atlantic,

00:07.439 --> 00:09.707
then Tom Bergeron comes out
and reveals

00:09.775 --> 00:12.026
that the pilot
is a six-year-old boy.

00:12.147 --> 00:15.806
We call it
"Child Hell Flight."

00:15.874 --> 00:17.258
Get out of here!

00:17.326 --> 00:18.800
- He is pitching a no-hitter.
- What?

00:18.868 --> 00:20.040
Starting
at 4:00 P.M. yesterday,

00:20.108 --> 00:22.588
when Mr. Donaghy coined
the word "innoventually,"

00:22.656 --> 00:24.993
- he has been flawless.
- So why do I have to leave?

00:25.061 --> 00:27.798
Because you have
so many unsolvable problems,

00:27.866 --> 00:29.200
like your mouth.

00:29.267 --> 00:31.232
It looks like somebody kicked
a hole in a bag of flour.

00:31.300 --> 00:32.901
Ow!

00:32.969 --> 00:34.373
Good news, Jonathan.

00:34.441 --> 00:36.177
"Child hell flight"
will "innoventually"

00:36.245 --> 00:37.946
be on the spring schedule.

00:38.014 --> 00:39.212
Oh!
Congratulations, sir.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.547
Miss Lemon was just leaving.

00:41.614 --> 00:43.115
Oh, no.
Lemon, please come in.

00:43.183 --> 00:44.384
When you're pitching
a perfect game,

00:44.451 --> 00:45.685
you don't walk Albert Pujols

00:45.753 --> 00:48.923
and you are the Albert Pujols
of having problems.

00:48.991 --> 00:50.492
Perfect game, huh?

00:50.559 --> 00:52.928
I haven't done
a single thing wrong

00:52.996 --> 00:54.563
in almost 24 hours,

00:54.631 --> 00:56.565
and I'm including sex
last night.

00:56.633 --> 00:59.569
Here's Avery's thank-you note.

00:59.636 --> 01:01.938
Ugh!
She likes that?

01:02.006 --> 01:04.206
No, but she respects it
when it's done correctly.

01:04.275 --> 01:06.943
Lemon, you may be witnessing
history here.

01:07.011 --> 01:08.946
Making it through
a full 24 hours

01:09.014 --> 01:10.949
without a single misstep
is called "reaganing."

01:11.016 --> 01:12.817
The only other people
who have ever done it...

01:12.885 --> 01:14.853
Lee Iaccoca, Jack Welch,
and... no judgment...

01:14.920 --> 01:16.054
Saddam Hussein.

01:16.122 --> 01:18.156
So what have you got for me?

01:18.224 --> 01:19.558
I need to get out
to Newark airport.

01:19.626 --> 01:21.627
Carol's on a layover,
and I really have to see him.

01:21.694 --> 01:22.895
You're horny,
and you want to get some.

01:22.962 --> 01:24.496
- I get it.
- Ew, Jack, gross.

01:24.564 --> 01:25.831
Come on.

01:25.899 --> 01:28.100
I just want to see him,
and I can't get a cab,

01:28.168 --> 01:30.770
because Greece is playing
Pakistan in soccer.

01:30.837 --> 01:32.571
Problem solved.
I'll take you.

01:32.639 --> 01:33.672
Really?

01:33.740 --> 01:35.107
I'll drop you off
at the airport,

01:35.175 --> 01:36.108
then I'll swing by MSNBC.

01:36.176 --> 01:37.409
I have to talk
to Rachel Maddow.

01:37.477 --> 01:40.179
Only one of us
can have this haircut.

01:43.216 --> 01:53.256
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:58.831 --> 02:02.300
k-Swiss, I need to cancel
my gig for hosting

02:02.368 --> 02:04.870
the MTV international
video music awards.

02:04.938 --> 02:06.639
Why wasn't I invited to that?

02:06.706 --> 02:08.340
My single is number four
in Japan.

02:08.407 --> 02:09.775
♪ Choke me, choke me ♪

02:09.842 --> 02:11.309
♪ blonde like choke me ♪

02:11.377 --> 02:12.577
♪ tee-hee-hee-hee-hee ♪

02:12.645 --> 02:14.013
I hate to bail,
but I've been asked

02:14.080 --> 02:16.181
to do a commercial for the
boys and girls club of America,

02:16.249 --> 02:18.951
and I just can't turn down
community service,

02:19.018 --> 02:20.885
because if I do,
that judge will make me

02:20.953 --> 02:22.386
join the coast guard.

02:22.454 --> 02:24.054
Well, I also recently received

02:24.121 --> 02:25.789
an unexpected honor...

02:25.856 --> 02:28.892
From the carvel ice cream
corporation.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.427
They gave me this
after I performed

02:30.494 --> 02:31.628
on their "Kidz 4-Eva!" float

02:31.695 --> 02:34.097
during last year's
Thanksgiving day parade.

02:34.164 --> 02:36.232
♪ Ice cream ♪

02:36.299 --> 02:39.034
♪ hey, don't you want
some ice cream? ♪

02:39.102 --> 02:41.002
I don't watch
the Macy's parade.

02:41.070 --> 02:42.670
If I want to see
a 50-foot spider man,

02:42.738 --> 02:46.507
I'll just go into my rec room,
thank you.

02:46.574 --> 02:49.743
Kenneth, take this card
and get a cake for the crew.

02:49.811 --> 02:52.078
Oh, that's very thoughtful,
miss Maroney.

02:52.146 --> 02:54.114
Well, one of the camera guys
just had a baby,

02:54.182 --> 02:55.582
and I'm sick of hearing
about it.

02:55.650 --> 02:58.551
This will put me back on top.

02:59.754 --> 03:00.854
What's wrong, Lemon?

03:00.921 --> 03:02.321
When I see you chew
your nails like that,

03:02.389 --> 03:04.023
I'd say that you're
very anxious,

03:04.091 --> 03:05.826
or you've handled
some ham earlier.

03:05.893 --> 03:07.160
When I get to the airport,

03:07.228 --> 03:08.995
I'm going to break up
with Carol.

03:09.063 --> 03:10.763
What?
Lemon, I am shocked.

03:10.831 --> 03:11.931
You two seemed so happy.

03:11.999 --> 03:13.266
The other day,
I saw you in the lobby

03:13.333 --> 03:14.600
laughing together.

03:14.668 --> 03:16.502
A guy on crutches bit it
in the revolving door,

03:16.570 --> 03:18.537
- and he was so scared.
- So what's the problem?

03:18.605 --> 03:19.771
You ate spaghetti
in front of him?

03:19.839 --> 03:20.839
Of course not.

03:20.907 --> 03:21.874
He got a fungus
from your shower?

03:21.941 --> 03:22.908
No.

03:22.975 --> 03:24.442
You had a fight
about something?

03:24.510 --> 03:26.678
No, we're not fighting.
We don't fight. It's just...

03:26.745 --> 03:28.580
nothing.
I don't want to talk about it.

03:28.647 --> 03:30.481
Lemon, I've known you
for four years,

03:30.549 --> 03:32.583
and in that time,
I've never known you

03:32.651 --> 03:35.052
to be shy about talking
about anything.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.554
Well, I found my first gray
toe-knuckle hair.

03:37.622 --> 03:39.689
If I could push a button
and five people in the world

03:39.757 --> 03:42.191
would die, but I'd get free
cable for life, I'd do it.

03:42.259 --> 03:43.626
And I'd been on
the toilet so long

03:43.694 --> 03:45.161
that my legs had fallen asleep,

03:45.229 --> 03:47.963
so when I tried to stand,
I just fell into my throw-up.

03:48.031 --> 03:50.465
There is one thing
you don't like to talk about.

03:50.533 --> 03:52.200
Why aren't we moving?

03:52.268 --> 03:53.601
Sex, Lemon...

03:53.669 --> 03:56.304
Coitus,
the beast with two backs.

03:56.371 --> 03:58.873
You and I have never had
an adult conversation

03:58.941 --> 03:59.940
about boning.

04:00.008 --> 04:01.909
Ugh! Fine.

04:01.977 --> 04:06.046
Carol and I are having
an intimacy problem.

04:06.114 --> 04:07.614
Okay, so tell me what happened.

04:07.682 --> 04:09.182
I was visiting Carol
in Las Vegas,

04:09.250 --> 04:11.084
and there was...

04:11.151 --> 04:12.918
A performance issue.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.286
That does happen to men.

04:14.354 --> 04:16.688
I faced it myself
with Greta van Susteren

04:16.755 --> 04:18.154
before her head transplant.

04:18.223 --> 04:20.791
You know,
why don't I call Carol?

04:20.858 --> 04:22.258
No, don't do that.

04:22.326 --> 04:24.894
I'm "reaganing," Lemon.
Let me solve this.

04:24.961 --> 04:26.128
It's not him.
It's me.

04:26.196 --> 04:28.096
I'm the one
with the performance problem.

04:28.164 --> 04:29.364
What are you talking about?

04:29.432 --> 04:32.300
I freaked out, and my junk
closed for business.

04:32.368 --> 04:35.836
It's like Fort Knox down there.

04:35.904 --> 04:37.638
I'm just going
to raise the barrier

04:37.705 --> 04:39.606
if that's okeydokey
with everyone.

04:39.674 --> 04:43.243
It's kind of like that.

04:45.679 --> 04:47.446
Tracy, haven't seen you

04:47.514 --> 04:49.748
since I was directing
"Garfield 3," and you ruined it.

04:49.816 --> 04:51.850
I had to move back in
with my parents.

04:51.918 --> 04:52.984
I envy you.

04:53.052 --> 04:55.086
I don't really know my parents.

04:55.154 --> 04:57.621
Okay. Let me take you
through the concept.

04:57.689 --> 04:59.523
It's all one shot, all right?

04:59.591 --> 05:01.291
We start on a boy shooting
a basketball,

05:01.359 --> 05:03.326
pan to some girls
double-dutching,

05:03.394 --> 05:05.828
then we pass the kid who does
a flip on a trampoline,

05:05.896 --> 05:07.963
follow a skateboarder
who jumps the curb

05:08.031 --> 05:11.599
and whizzes past you
for your line.

05:11.667 --> 05:12.767
What line?

05:12.835 --> 05:15.036
"Boys and girls clubs
of America,

05:15.103 --> 05:16.203
be great."

05:16.271 --> 05:19.540
We faxed the script
to someone named Grizz.

05:19.607 --> 05:21.441
Scripts get in the way
of my process, Shawn.

05:21.509 --> 05:26.112
Let's just shoot a hundred
of these and see what we get.

05:26.179 --> 05:28.380
Here's your cake, miss Maroney.

05:28.448 --> 05:30.415
Let's see.

05:30.483 --> 05:31.817
"Jenny"?

05:31.885 --> 05:34.353
That's not my name.

05:34.421 --> 05:35.921
I don't want wheelchair Jenny
from accounting

05:35.989 --> 05:37.422
getting credit for my cake.

05:37.490 --> 05:39.023
Take it back to carvel.

05:39.091 --> 05:40.958
But then
they'll just throw it out.

05:41.026 --> 05:42.359
So?

05:42.427 --> 05:44.094
I know food's plentiful
around here, miss Maroney,

05:44.162 --> 05:46.863
but back home on our pig farm,
times are tough.

05:46.931 --> 05:49.965
We've had to sell off Sally,
Julie, and poppy.

05:50.033 --> 05:51.633
Are those some of your pigs?

05:51.701 --> 05:53.468
Yes.

05:53.536 --> 05:55.437
Take the cake back, Kenneth.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.742
You know, your little problem
makes sense, Lemon.

06:01.810 --> 06:04.576
You have more sexual hang-ups
than an adult chat line

06:04.643 --> 06:06.143
run by Gilbert Gottfried.

06:06.211 --> 06:07.478
What?

06:07.546 --> 06:09.213
That was written
by a computer program

06:09.281 --> 06:10.514
we're working on
to replace you.

06:10.582 --> 06:12.415
No, I don't have hang-ups.

06:12.483 --> 06:14.750
You don't think
you're a bit of a prude...

06:14.818 --> 06:17.520
A little squeamish
and conservative?

06:17.587 --> 06:19.221
Sex always makes things worse.

06:19.289 --> 06:22.225
Jack, why don't you just say
you want some...?

06:22.293 --> 06:24.394
- Is that sex, Lemon?
- Is the way I do it.

06:24.461 --> 06:25.394
We are lovers.

06:25.462 --> 06:26.762
Oh, that word bums me out

06:26.830 --> 06:28.898
unless it's between the words
"meat" and "pizza."

06:28.966 --> 06:30.700
Ugh!
She likes that?

06:30.767 --> 06:32.936
Okay, fine. Maybe I'm
a little old-fashioned.

06:33.003 --> 06:34.070
I'm sorry I'm a real woman

06:34.138 --> 06:36.572
and not some oversexed
New York nympho

06:36.639 --> 06:40.107
<i>like those sluts
on everybody loves Raymond.</i>

06:40.174 --> 06:41.741
Wow. This may be
the greatest challenge

06:41.809 --> 06:43.742
a potential "reaganer"
has ever faced.

06:43.810 --> 06:46.344
I'm gonna fix you and save
your relationship with Carol.

06:46.412 --> 06:47.679
I don't need to be fixed.

06:47.747 --> 06:50.181
- Has it happened before?
- Yes...

06:50.249 --> 06:52.249
With my college boyfriend
Joel Sucheki,

06:52.317 --> 06:54.884
a couple of times with Dennis,
and now Carol.

06:54.952 --> 06:56.552
There has to be a root cause,
maybe from your past.

06:56.620 --> 06:57.653
There isn't, Jack.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.188
There's got to be something.
Go deep.

06:59.256 --> 07:00.756
You think I haven't thought
about this?

07:00.824 --> 07:02.024
- There's nothing.
- Dig. Dig down.

07:02.092 --> 07:03.391
Dive into the sexual abyss.

07:03.459 --> 07:04.492
Stop it, Jack!
Stop it!

07:04.560 --> 07:07.794
Stop asking
about the roller skates!

07:11.766 --> 07:13.366
And...Action!

07:15.000 --> 07:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:29.749 --> 07:30.815
What's my cue?

07:30.883 --> 07:32.149
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

07:32.216 --> 07:33.416
I don't know my lines.

07:33.483 --> 07:34.415
Cut!

07:36.718 --> 07:38.985
Tracy, we're causing
a huge traffic jam.

07:39.053 --> 07:40.820
We're causing
a huge traffic jam

07:40.888 --> 07:42.989
while getting paid
to make dreams.

07:43.057 --> 07:45.193
We're the luckiest people
on earth.

07:45.260 --> 07:47.194
Now someone get me a jolt cola!

07:47.262 --> 07:49.229
It does not exist anymore!

07:52.533 --> 07:55.001
Here's the money back
from carvel, miss Maroney...

07:55.069 --> 07:57.937
$23.94.

07:58.005 --> 08:00.106
Hang on.
She gave you cash?

08:00.173 --> 08:01.340
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

08:01.408 --> 08:03.441
I told the girl
I didn't have your card, so...

08:03.509 --> 08:06.243
she must have thought you
meant credit card.

08:06.311 --> 08:09.212
How many cashiers are
at that store?

08:09.279 --> 08:11.079
Two.
This is fun.

08:11.147 --> 08:12.314
Oh, my God.

08:12.382 --> 08:14.148
We could run
the short grift on this.

08:14.216 --> 08:16.417
It's been years
since my mom and I

08:16.485 --> 08:18.653
used to pull slip-and-falls
at supermarkets.

08:18.721 --> 08:20.088
I thought I was done
with that life,

08:20.156 --> 08:22.325
but this is too good.

08:22.392 --> 08:24.627
We can pull an Arizona
double-back on them, Kenneth.

08:24.695 --> 08:26.596
I don't understand
what you're saying,

08:26.664 --> 08:28.698
but I like that it has
the word "we" in it.

08:32.068 --> 08:33.836
I'd like to order a cake
that reads,

08:33.904 --> 08:35.571
"Happy Birthday, Blenna."

08:35.638 --> 08:39.474
- "Blenna"?
- Yes.

08:39.542 --> 08:41.909
I'm sorry, miss, but there's
been a mistake with this cake,

08:41.977 --> 08:43.910
and I'm afraid
I don't have the card.

08:43.979 --> 08:45.179
Okay, um, I'm sorry.

08:45.246 --> 08:46.980
Um, I'll just give you
cash back.

08:48.650 --> 08:52.452
I need a "happy blirthday,
Jennica" cake.

08:58.258 --> 08:59.658
Yes.

08:59.726 --> 09:01.793
"Bappy hirthday, Gremlin."

09:06.531 --> 09:09.332
Lemon, what do you want
to tell me about the, uh...

09:09.399 --> 09:10.332
Roller skates?

09:10.400 --> 09:11.633
Why are we not moving?

09:11.701 --> 09:14.034
What is causing
this traffic jam?

09:29.715 --> 09:31.647
I'm sorry.
I have an erection.

09:31.715 --> 09:33.548
I think it's the sound
of the skateboard.

09:33.616 --> 09:36.351
We're going again.
Everybody safely back to one.

09:36.419 --> 09:39.320
Let me help you.
I am unstoppable today.

09:39.388 --> 09:40.721
If it'll make it any easier,

09:40.789 --> 09:44.225
imagine you're telling
your story to Reagan himself.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.260
Well, Liz, will you tell

09:46.327 --> 09:48.962
the gipper your sexual story?

09:49.030 --> 09:52.532
Mommy?

09:52.599 --> 09:55.000
I was nine years old.

09:55.068 --> 09:56.969
I was roller-skating
in the house,

09:57.036 --> 09:58.670
which was absolutely forbidden.

09:58.738 --> 10:00.505
I was skating down the hallway

10:00.573 --> 10:02.973
on top of the world
with my new skates

10:03.041 --> 10:05.108
and my new haircut,
which everybody thought

10:05.175 --> 10:08.578
was a Dorothy Hamill,
but was actually a Pete rose.

10:08.646 --> 10:11.347
Anyway, I needed to go
to the bathroom,

10:11.414 --> 10:13.349
but the door was locked.

10:13.416 --> 10:16.052
My recently divorced aunt
had moved in with us,

10:16.119 --> 10:17.920
and I was sharing
a bathroom with her.

10:17.987 --> 10:21.188
To be prepared, I tried
to take my underpants off

10:21.256 --> 10:23.490
over my roller skates.

10:23.558 --> 10:26.026
I slipped, and as I fell,

10:26.093 --> 10:29.596
I pulled down this poster
of the singer Tom Jones

10:29.663 --> 10:30.830
that my aunt had put up.

10:30.898 --> 10:34.700
My mom heard the noise
and ran and found me...

10:34.767 --> 10:37.034
Squirming
under the Tom Jones poster

10:37.102 --> 10:40.704
with my underpants
around my ankles.

10:40.772 --> 10:44.541
It didn't look good, Jack.

10:44.609 --> 10:47.410
She thought I did it
on purpose.

10:47.477 --> 10:49.411
And she didn't say a word.

10:49.479 --> 10:52.981
She just went in my room
and took all my posters...

10:53.049 --> 10:56.117
grizzly Adams, Larry Wilcox,

10:56.184 --> 10:59.453
Han Solo, Tug McGraw,

10:59.521 --> 11:02.156
Mike Schmidt, Kermit,

11:02.224 --> 11:04.125
Gunther Gebel-Williams.

11:04.192 --> 11:06.961
She took all
the people away, Jack.

11:07.029 --> 11:09.395
Sex makes the people go away!

11:14.531 --> 11:17.832
I'm gonna see what's up
with this traffic.

11:20.702 --> 11:22.402
Oh, here's
your money back, ma'am.

11:22.470 --> 11:24.837
Boy, they sure are making a lot
of mistakes over there today.

11:24.905 --> 11:26.637
Do you really not understand
what we're doing?

11:26.705 --> 11:27.805
Of course I do.

11:27.873 --> 11:29.473
We're standing here talking,

11:29.541 --> 11:32.844
adding brick after brick
to our friendship castle

11:32.912 --> 11:36.516
so it someday reaches the sky.

11:36.584 --> 11:38.151
With carvel, Kenneth.

11:38.218 --> 11:39.652
We're conning them.

11:39.720 --> 11:42.955
I'm ordering messed-up cakes and
getting them free with my card.

11:43.023 --> 11:45.124
Then you're returning them
for cash.

11:45.192 --> 11:47.259
We're selling back free cakes.

11:47.327 --> 11:49.561
But, miss Maroney, that's wrong

11:49.629 --> 11:51.863
and illegal.

11:51.931 --> 11:54.766
If cookie puss knew, he'd tear
us apart with his fangs.

11:54.833 --> 11:56.767
Well, here's your cut.

11:56.835 --> 11:59.569
We're not hurting anybody.
Carvel's got plenty of money.

11:59.637 --> 12:00.570
- But the...
- Shh.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.204
I need a partner
to pull this off

12:02.272 --> 12:03.873
and think of all
the good you can do

12:03.940 --> 12:05.374
with that money back home.

12:05.442 --> 12:07.109
They do need help.

12:07.177 --> 12:09.044
And with enough money,
they could buy

12:09.111 --> 12:11.179
those magic beans
from that old hermit.

12:11.246 --> 12:12.480
We'd be rich.

12:12.547 --> 12:13.580
Hang on.

12:13.648 --> 12:15.815
Why isn't the hermit rich?

12:15.883 --> 12:18.417
Oh, wait. He is.
He has a lot of friends.

12:18.485 --> 12:20.552
Take the money, Kenneth.

12:20.620 --> 12:22.387
Help your family.

12:22.455 --> 12:24.622
No one will ever know.

12:42.572 --> 12:44.439
Shirt on or off, Shawn?

12:44.507 --> 12:45.773
- On!
- Good note!

12:45.841 --> 12:46.773
Back to one!

12:46.840 --> 12:48.974
Hey, Jackie d!

12:49.042 --> 12:52.477
Let's take a quick 500
so everybody can meet Jack!

12:52.545 --> 12:53.778
You know him?

12:53.846 --> 12:56.747
Please help me get his line.
Fix this.

12:56.815 --> 13:00.484
No, I don't need
any more problems to solve,

13:00.551 --> 13:02.755
especially not him.

13:02.822 --> 13:04.589
I am the Sisyphus
of "reaganing."

13:04.657 --> 13:06.190
Yeah!

13:06.258 --> 13:08.360
That's the kind of stuff
I should be saying.

13:08.428 --> 13:12.031
It's in my head now.
Let's roll.

13:12.099 --> 13:14.099
I'm sorry, jelly beans.

13:14.167 --> 13:17.268
I know how much the gipper
liked you, and...

13:17.336 --> 13:19.337
I've failed him.

13:19.404 --> 13:21.138
It's funny.

13:21.206 --> 13:23.207
I remember George Shultz
telling me

13:23.275 --> 13:25.175
how later
in Reagan's presidency

13:25.243 --> 13:28.644
when his mind was, uh,
resting...

13:28.712 --> 13:31.548
How they would use jelly beans
to convince people

13:31.616 --> 13:33.616
that he was...

13:33.684 --> 13:35.651
That's it.

13:35.719 --> 13:37.119
I know how to fix Tracy.

13:37.187 --> 13:38.887
Make him eat these.

13:38.955 --> 13:40.355
I'll take care of the rest.

13:53.501 --> 13:56.735
Boys and girls clubs of America,

13:56.803 --> 13:58.637
be great.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.138
Oh, my God.

14:00.206 --> 14:01.673
We got it!

14:03.442 --> 14:06.410
I'm on my way, Liz Lemon.

14:06.478 --> 14:09.079
Make way.
I'm "reaganing."

14:10.734 --> 14:12.132
Don't you worry.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.567
I'm sending you some money
so you can get your operation.

14:15.435 --> 14:17.035
Now, can you put a human
on the phone?

14:18.471 --> 14:20.104
Hello?

14:25.943 --> 14:27.110
Well, Kenneth, it's over.

14:27.177 --> 14:28.611
I got made at carvel.

14:28.679 --> 14:31.680
They figured out our scam
and gave me this.

14:31.748 --> 14:33.648
What?
No.

14:33.716 --> 14:35.683
Sorry.
It's the short grift.

14:35.751 --> 14:37.885
You got to walk away.

14:37.952 --> 14:39.553
We can't stop now.

14:39.620 --> 14:41.388
My family needs money.

14:41.455 --> 14:42.989
But they're onto us.

14:43.057 --> 14:45.658
I have another idea...
For a long con.

14:45.725 --> 14:47.993
Kenneth, I know
your intentions are good,

14:48.060 --> 14:50.361
but I don't like what this
is doing to you.

14:50.429 --> 14:53.230
You seem meaner and stronger.

14:53.298 --> 14:56.733
What if you got a motorcycle,
and we did it on it?

14:56.800 --> 14:59.468
- Are you in or not?
- What's the angle?

14:59.536 --> 15:02.804
Who else was on that
Thanksgiving float with you?

15:02.871 --> 15:04.905
One last long grift, huh?

15:04.973 --> 15:07.307
Okay, I'm in.

15:07.375 --> 15:08.841
But one rule...

15:08.909 --> 15:10.909
Anybody gets hurt
during the score,

15:10.977 --> 15:12.511
we leave them behind to die.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.413
Now...

15:14.480 --> 15:17.149
Who are you,
and what are we doing?

15:17.216 --> 15:19.183
That cake is worth $40.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.851
I'm not sure we can do that.

15:20.919 --> 15:24.088
Liz wrote this sketch
before she left.

15:24.156 --> 15:25.891
Ice-cream-cake
eating contest?

15:25.959 --> 15:28.794
Okay, we're gonna need
about 20 cakes for this.

15:28.862 --> 15:30.028
I'll tell props.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.330
No, Pete.
I'll tell props.

15:32.398 --> 15:33.598
Okay.

15:33.665 --> 15:35.132
Good afternoon.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.500
I would like 21 cakes
that read,

15:36.568 --> 15:39.002
"Frajer reunion 2010."

15:39.070 --> 15:40.970
Isn't it "Frasier"?

15:41.038 --> 15:42.204
No, it's "Frajer."

15:42.272 --> 15:45.741
And I should know.
I'm "Frajer."

16:10.797 --> 16:12.263
I mean, "Frajer"?

16:12.331 --> 16:13.331
Come on.

16:13.399 --> 16:15.200
I should throw some
tossed salad

16:15.267 --> 16:18.670
and scrambled eggs at you.

16:20.374 --> 16:22.375
"Frajer."

16:29.148 --> 16:32.017
No.

16:32.084 --> 16:35.786
"Frajer"!

16:35.854 --> 16:38.021
We sold the cakes twice.

16:38.088 --> 16:40.322
You're a genius, Kenneth.

16:40.390 --> 16:42.223
$800 split 3 ways.

16:42.291 --> 16:44.091
Those ice-cream saps
will rue the day

16:44.158 --> 16:45.792
they ever tangled with...

16:45.859 --> 16:47.393
The best friends gang.

16:53.100 --> 16:54.634
Lemon!
Why did you leave?

16:54.702 --> 16:55.937
I'm trying to help you.

16:56.005 --> 16:58.273
You can't help me.
No one can.

16:58.341 --> 17:00.707
Well, I'm fixing you,

17:00.775 --> 17:02.308
and I'm saving
your relationship.

17:02.376 --> 17:03.542
I can do it.

17:03.609 --> 17:05.742
Look, sex is
a beautiful, natural,

17:05.810 --> 17:09.045
and joyful part of our shared
human experience.

17:09.113 --> 17:10.380
Hey, you two want to party?

17:10.448 --> 17:11.414
Now is not a good time, miss.

17:11.482 --> 17:12.781
$20 for a party,

17:12.849 --> 17:14.784
$60 to bite me during it.

17:14.851 --> 17:17.086
I'll do stuff with a dog,
but I get to pick the dog.

17:17.153 --> 17:18.787
- People want that?
- This is not helping!

17:18.855 --> 17:20.488
You want to watch me
be with her?

17:20.556 --> 17:21.689
Me with you?

17:21.757 --> 17:23.490
Me and both of you
without my leg?

17:23.558 --> 17:24.491
Thank you.

17:24.559 --> 17:25.959
Just, uh, take this

17:26.027 --> 17:27.260
and, uh, move along.

17:27.328 --> 17:28.594
You two are pretty uptight

17:28.662 --> 17:30.996
for hanging out under a bridge.

17:31.063 --> 17:33.330
Sex is horrible.

17:35.766 --> 17:37.767
- What is it?
- It's 4:00, sir.

17:37.835 --> 17:40.202
You did it... a day of perfect
problem solving.

17:40.270 --> 17:42.370
Gifts have been coming in
all afternoon.

17:42.438 --> 17:43.838
It's 4:00?

17:43.905 --> 17:45.539
And you fixed me, so...

17:45.607 --> 17:46.541
Yay.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.284
Send everything back.

17:48.351 --> 17:50.964
- What? Why?
- I didn't do it.

17:51.032 --> 17:52.332
I failed.

17:52.399 --> 17:54.233
- It's her, isn't it?
- Sorry.

17:54.300 --> 17:56.835
I hate her, sir!

18:00.371 --> 18:04.007
Stupid cookie puss!

18:04.074 --> 18:05.475
Are you all right, miss?

18:05.542 --> 18:09.479
I just got fired 'cause
Kelsey Grammer scammed me.

18:09.547 --> 18:10.848
Forget trying to go straight.

18:10.916 --> 18:15.686
I'm going back to working
under that bridge.

18:15.754 --> 18:18.055
I know.

18:18.123 --> 18:19.389
Kenneth, we got a new con.

18:19.457 --> 18:20.857
We're gonna go down to Florida,

18:20.925 --> 18:22.659
open up
a medical-supply store,

18:22.726 --> 18:24.260
then get
some social security numbers.

18:24.328 --> 18:26.062
Through seduction.

18:26.129 --> 18:27.463
I'm sorry, sir-ma'am.

18:27.530 --> 18:28.830
- I'm out.
- What?

18:28.898 --> 18:30.265
Why?

18:30.333 --> 18:32.033
Because miss Maroney was wrong.

18:32.101 --> 18:34.568
People did get hurt
by our actions.

18:34.636 --> 18:37.271
And, yes, my family
sure could use

18:37.338 --> 18:40.540
a couple hundred more dollars,
but it's not right.

18:40.608 --> 18:42.408
A couple hundred dollars, huh?

18:42.476 --> 18:44.110
I think I can help you out.

18:44.177 --> 18:46.245
But first I'm gonna
need $50 to get started.

18:46.313 --> 18:48.447
Kelsey, no.

18:48.515 --> 18:49.882
I'm proud of you, Kenneth.

18:49.949 --> 18:51.616
You've got a good heart.

18:51.684 --> 18:53.151
I hope you get
into a car accident someday,

18:53.219 --> 18:54.619
so I can have it.

18:54.686 --> 18:56.520
Now there's only one thing
left to do.

18:56.588 --> 18:58.622
Beat you out
of the best friends gang.

19:08.664 --> 19:10.631
Well, it's been
a pretty rough day,

19:10.699 --> 19:12.066
but at least
we're in Newark now.

19:12.134 --> 19:13.767
What are you gonna do
about Carol?

19:13.835 --> 19:15.568
I'm gonna break up with him,
let him off the hook.

19:15.636 --> 19:17.269
That would be a mistake, Lemon.

19:17.337 --> 19:19.471
Yes, you are
the sexual equivalent

19:19.539 --> 19:21.607
of a million hindenburgs,
but you deserve

19:21.674 --> 19:23.475
someone like Carol
in your life,

19:23.542 --> 19:24.942
and he deserves you, because...

19:25.010 --> 19:26.677
and I'm only gonna say this
once a decade...

19:26.745 --> 19:28.279
you're great.

19:28.346 --> 19:30.747
You're Liz Lemon, damn it.

19:30.815 --> 19:32.415
In certain lights, you're an 8

19:32.483 --> 19:34.250
using east coast over-35
standards,

19:34.318 --> 19:35.618
excluding Miami.

19:35.686 --> 19:36.819
Thanks, Jack.

19:36.887 --> 19:38.487
You go in there,
you grab Carol,

19:38.555 --> 19:40.489
you take him into one of those
unisex family bathrooms,

19:40.557 --> 19:42.057
pull down
that diaper-changing thing,

19:42.124 --> 19:43.992
and go to town on him.

19:44.059 --> 19:46.026
I'll try,
but if I couldn't get it done

19:46.094 --> 19:47.994
in Vegas
after a Penn & Teller show,

19:48.095 --> 19:49.762
I don't know
how it's gonna happen here.

19:49.830 --> 19:52.831
Wait a minute.

19:52.899 --> 19:54.799
You had your problem
with Carol in Las Vegas?

19:54.867 --> 19:56.500
- So?
- The Tom Jones poster.

19:56.568 --> 19:58.668
Tom Jones plays Vegas
all the time.

19:58.736 --> 20:00.269
He has billboards everywhere.

20:00.337 --> 20:01.570
No kidding.

20:01.638 --> 20:03.705
There was one right
outside our hotel-room window.

20:03.773 --> 20:05.106
Oh, my God.

20:05.174 --> 20:06.541
Think back
to your college boyfriend.

20:06.609 --> 20:07.910
- Was there any...
- Yes!

20:07.977 --> 20:09.612
When this happened with Joel,

20:09.680 --> 20:11.014
<i>what's new pussycat?
Was playing</i>

20:11.081 --> 20:12.248
on the bus we were on.

20:12.315 --> 20:13.482
I mean, the room we were in.

20:13.550 --> 20:14.616
And when it happened
with Dennis,

20:14.684 --> 20:15.784
he had just gotten a perm.

20:15.851 --> 20:17.352
Tom Jones is the trigger.

20:17.420 --> 20:20.154
He makes you remember your
mother taking the people away.

20:20.221 --> 20:21.855
Does this mean I'm fixed?

20:21.922 --> 20:24.423
Oh, God, no. You've got years
of therapy ahead of you,

20:24.491 --> 20:25.724
probably electroshock.

20:25.792 --> 20:28.259
But this is a breakthrough,
Lemon, and a big one.

20:28.327 --> 20:30.694
Jack Donaghy, in my book,
you're better than Reagan.

20:30.761 --> 20:32.462
I appreciate that, Lemon,
but if you ever speak ill

20:32.529 --> 20:35.230
of Reagan again, I will smack
those teeth straight.

20:38.434 --> 20:41.469
U-S-A! U-S-A!

20:41.537 --> 20:44.305
U-S-A! U-S-A!

20:47.176 --> 20:48.776
He's at JFK.

20:48.844 --> 20:50.545
I wrote it down wrong.

20:50.613 --> 20:53.947
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

21:04.004 --> 21:05.505
- How is the sex?
- Fast and only on Saturdays.

21:06.272 --> 21:07.172
It's perfect.

21:07.240 --> 21:08.807
I have been sexually rejected

21:08.874 --> 21:11.409
by not one, but two guys

21:11.477 --> 21:13.544
who later
went to clown college.

21:13.612 --> 21:15.746
And one time at summer camp,
I kissed a girl on a dare,

21:15.814 --> 21:17.481
but then she drowned.

21:17.549 --> 21:19.749
It was the first gay guy
I ever kissed.

21:19.817 --> 21:21.518
Standing up?
What?

21:21.585 --> 21:22.752
How does that even work?

21:22.820 --> 21:25.187
- You haven't had sex?
- Shh.

21:25.255 --> 21:27.089
We have, of course,
pleasured one another.

21:27.157 --> 21:28.390
No, stop.
I believe.

21:28.458 --> 21:30.558
Ugh!
Stop saying, "relationship."

21:30.626 --> 21:32.493
I'm sorry.
I was going to say, "climax."

21:32.561 --> 21:33.995
Ah!
