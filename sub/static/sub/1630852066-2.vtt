WEBVTT

00:30.781 --> 00:34.952
I got back from deployment
somewhere in that first week of September.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.579
I had just landed in San Diego,

00:37.663 --> 00:40.332
and I got a group text message
from the Sewing Circle,

00:41.041 --> 00:44.253
which was a group of guys
that were on that deployment.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.276
Some of the guys were saying,
"Yeah, we need to talk about the stuff

01:07.359 --> 01:09.236
that's been going on with Eddie."

01:11.446 --> 01:13.240
"We need to report him."

01:24.001 --> 01:28.839
I really tried to block out
what happened on that deployment.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.302
I was having problems
looking my family in the eyes.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.555
I was filled with guilt and shame.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.436
So I was like, "Hell yeah."

01:44.771 --> 01:46.398
"Let's do this."

01:48.775 --> 01:51.028
It goes against everything
you've ever been taught

01:51.111 --> 01:53.530
to turn in someone on your own team.

01:54.031 --> 01:56.909
It was just totally foreign
and uncharted territory.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.252
I was done. Completely done with him.

02:08.669 --> 02:13.592
We thought we had information that could
put Eddie Gallagher away for life.

02:14.718 --> 02:17.513
My only regret is that
I did not do more to stop him.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.814
We're here to train and go to war.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.858
I was like, "Hell yeah. Let's do this."

02:32.402 --> 02:34.530
These men were my family, my brothers.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.823
This bond of warfighters.

02:40.911 --> 02:43.330
You could just tell
that something was off.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.542
There was this undercurrent
in this platoon.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.465
How do you sleep at night
knowing what you did?

02:54.550 --> 02:56.218
I just saw it as good versus evil.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.470
It's that simple.

03:14.152 --> 03:17.531
Warpinski: What we're going to talk about
today is that there are

03:17.614 --> 03:19.950
issues with a case involving

03:20.033 --> 03:21.827
the Law of Armed Conflict
and a murder case.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.161
-Eddie: Yep.
-Okay.

03:23.245 --> 03:26.331
So, what I want you to do is just
read this first sentence for me out loud.

03:27.374 --> 03:31.336
"I, SOC Edward Gallagher,
have been advised

03:31.420 --> 03:37.509
by SA Joe Warpinski that I am suspected
of violation of Article 118, murder."

03:37.593 --> 03:39.136
Warpinski: Okay, so

03:39.219 --> 03:41.346
I'm not saying you're guilty.
I'm not saying anything like that.

03:41.430 --> 03:44.266
Just, that's what we're going to have
a discussion about today.

03:45.809 --> 03:49.062
NCIS Investigator: Are you aware of,
like, the allegations in this case?

03:49.146 --> 03:52.191
Are you aware of some of the crimes
that have been alleged against Eddie?

03:52.941 --> 03:55.694
I am aware that
he's charged with premeditated murder.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.158
Before we even left for deployment

04:01.241 --> 04:02.743
we were having a barbecue.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.370
He'd been drinking a little bit
and he just turns to me and he goes,

04:05.454 --> 04:06.538
"It's gonna be a good deployment."

04:06.622 --> 04:08.373
I'm like, "Yeah, I'm real excited.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.501
It's gonna be an awesome deployment."
He's like, "Yeah.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.294
Someone's gonna die."

04:12.377 --> 04:14.880
And I'm like, "What are you talking about?
Why does that make it a good deployment?"

04:14.963 --> 04:16.714
He's like, "We'll see."

04:20.469 --> 04:23.680
Warpinski: What was Gallagher's
reputation like when you got there?

04:25.182 --> 04:27.392
Stoner:
He was good. Tactically, he was good.

04:27.476 --> 04:30.354
When we got overseas,
it was a complete 180.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.647
It changed immediately.

04:33.357 --> 04:36.568
The chief is
the big brother of the platoon.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.446
He's got the authority
that's given to him,

04:39.530 --> 04:43.408
but he's also the one that's going to be
mentoring the guys from his experiences.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.078
Are you talking about
being on this side facing that way?

04:46.161 --> 04:47.329
Eddie: Yeah.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.998
Eddie had a great reputation
going into it.

04:50.666 --> 04:52.417
He had combat experience.

04:52.501 --> 04:53.418
I know.

04:53.502 --> 04:56.505
Eddie was a mentor and a personal friend.

04:56.588 --> 04:58.382
All right, we got everybody here?

04:58.465 --> 04:59.633
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

04:59.716 --> 05:01.635
Eddie:
Let's go. Let's fucking go. Let's go.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.554
We had built up a level of trust.

05:05.347 --> 05:08.767
We had a great group of guys out there
that were very motivated.

05:08.851 --> 05:09.852
Watch out!

05:12.020 --> 05:13.647
They had so much promise.

05:15.482 --> 05:19.486
But then all these little things
which started growing and growing

05:19.570 --> 05:20.696
and tearing us apart.

05:24.533 --> 05:27.536
The chief really dictates
the culture of the platoon.

05:28.829 --> 05:32.332
And the best platoon has
a really strong chief

05:32.416 --> 05:35.627
and the officer in charge
who keeps the law and order

05:35.711 --> 05:39.214
and isn't afraid to put people in check.

05:39.298 --> 05:41.550
But we weren't a normal platoon.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.762
Jake Portier was
a officer in charge of our platoon.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.931
Portier:
We have three guys going back and forth.

05:48.599 --> 05:50.642
Cleanups, mortars.
Go and hit them with those.

05:50.726 --> 05:52.936
He was a younger guy,
certainly younger than Eddie,

05:53.020 --> 05:56.732
and he was supposed to be
the person that Eddie reported to.

05:56.815 --> 06:00.819
Although, that relationship was different
because Eddie had been his instructor.

06:01.570 --> 06:02.571
What about your altitude?

06:02.654 --> 06:03.822
I'm over a thousand.

06:03.906 --> 06:07.743
Jake Portier, I knew him.
I was Jake's instructor through BUD/S,

06:07.826 --> 06:10.871
and he was also on my previous deployment.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.498
He's overall in charge,

06:13.582 --> 06:16.877
but I'm also overall in charge
of the tactical picture.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.921
I have a lot more experience than him.

06:19.588 --> 06:20.589
I'm a stubborn dude.

06:20.672 --> 06:23.008
If I want to do something,
I'm gonna do it.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.469
Jake, here's his original impact.
Here's his second.

06:25.552 --> 06:29.932
Portier: Just call it out for him. Just
tell him where but don't say right 40--

06:30.015 --> 06:31.058
What Eddie said.

06:31.141 --> 06:36.355
I don't think Jake was ever able
to picture himself as in charge of Eddie,

06:36.438 --> 06:39.942
and Eddie basically assumed
control of the platoon.

06:40.025 --> 06:42.986
Eddie: Once we're set, have them
pull up to their positions again.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.948
See if we can see who's fucking shooting.

06:46.031 --> 06:49.076
Because ERD just took a round
up there as they fucking crossed.

06:49.618 --> 06:53.580
And once we get in the general direction
of where we think it's coming from

06:54.289 --> 06:56.208
-get at 'em.
-Okay.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.126
As we were on deployment,

06:58.210 --> 07:00.337
we started noticing
something was, like, off.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.173
We kept going back
to the same locations operationally.

07:03.674 --> 07:04.758
Which doesn't make sense

07:04.842 --> 07:07.845
if you're a special operator
trying to be "sneaky-peeky."

07:10.722 --> 07:13.642
This is one of the reasons why
I didn't like Eddie on this deployment.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.561
All right, Eddie.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.729
Eddie: Your GPS.

07:17.813 --> 07:21.692
Eddie was going against what I thought was

07:21.775 --> 07:24.319
an acceptable amount of risk
for an operation.

07:25.988 --> 07:27.114
Yeah.

07:27.197 --> 07:30.325
So I have airplane
and location services turned off.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.997
On one of our morning roundups,

07:35.080 --> 07:37.666
Eddie came out and said,
"Everyone, turn off your ATAKs.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.334
We're gonna stir up the hornet's nest."

07:39.418 --> 07:40.961
And what he meant was that

07:41.044 --> 07:44.756
anyone who was wearing this GPS locator
should turn it off

07:44.840 --> 07:47.801
because he intended to go into
a place that was not allowed.

07:47.885 --> 07:49.761
The ISIS safe house is this one.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.222
This road that runs that way.

07:52.306 --> 07:55.601
There's a whole fuck ton of them
running around.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.937
Eddie: Okay. We'll keep moving forward.

08:02.024 --> 08:04.401
Turning off all trackers is stupid

08:04.484 --> 08:09.323
because now you've got people,
bopping around the streets with guns,

08:09.406 --> 08:10.532
that are unidentified.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.244
Our own aircraft can target that.

08:14.328 --> 08:18.457
Like, that looks like ISIS,
you know, from 30,000 feet.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.212
The decisions Eddie was making

08:23.295 --> 08:26.173
and the areas that we were going to,
how often we were going to those areas

08:26.256 --> 08:27.633
over and over again

08:27.716 --> 08:29.551
just became reckless.

08:29.635 --> 08:31.637
Unfortunately, I was so naive and green

08:31.720 --> 08:34.556
that I was like, "You know what,
I'm going to follow him everywhere.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.267
At the end of the day, there's no way
he's gonna call me a coward."

08:38.477 --> 08:39.937
Stay out here, yeah?

08:48.070 --> 08:51.657
On this day, we were in front of
where we were allowed to be.

08:52.908 --> 08:54.159
Shut that gate.

08:54.952 --> 09:00.499
There's Jake, Shu, Corey,
Eddie, Dragon, and myself and Gio.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.254
Corey and Dragon,
one of the new guys, go up to the roof

09:05.337 --> 09:06.839
while we're one floor below.

09:14.221 --> 09:18.100
Suddenly we heard a shot,
then we heard Dragon, you know, grunt.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.226
Likeâ€¦

09:22.271 --> 09:24.565
And somebody yelled up like,
"Hey, are you okay?"

09:24.648 --> 09:27.192
And he said, "No, I'm not."

09:31.238 --> 09:33.824
It was that mad minute
to get him off that roof.

09:37.119 --> 09:38.787
Hurry up and get off this fucking--

09:38.871 --> 09:40.080
Book it, dude!

09:47.087 --> 09:48.380
TC: Ready. One, two, three.

09:52.342 --> 09:53.677
TC: Hey, he's fucking resisting.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.012
Yeah, I know.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.847
TC: Pick up his legs. Pick up--

09:56.930 --> 09:58.765
Dragon! You gotta help me out, dude.

09:58.849 --> 10:00.934
How much blood has he lost?

10:01.018 --> 10:03.395
He still had a radial pulse,
like, five minutes ago.

10:03.478 --> 10:06.648
But he's got at least two gunshot wounds.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.400
And one exiting out of his ass.

10:08.483 --> 10:11.153
TC: Hey, I got you, buddy.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.947
It was one of those moments
where it was like, "Hey,

10:14.031 --> 10:19.494
we are a little bit out of
where we're supposed to be right now."

10:19.578 --> 10:21.163
-TC: Jake!
-Portier: Yeah?

10:21.246 --> 10:22.915
Let's transfer him to the RG.

10:22.998 --> 10:24.541
Jake just started freaking out.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.877
He's like, "Eddie, we gotta go.
We gotta go.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.047
ISR is gonna see us. We're gonna
get caught. Let's go, let's go."

10:31.590 --> 10:34.551
Eddie looks Dragon in the eye.
Gets in his face, and he goes,

10:34.635 --> 10:37.846
"Dragon, you're gonna tell everyone
that you got shot back at the ME.

10:37.930 --> 10:41.058
You're not gonna tell anyone that we moved
past where we're supposed to be."

10:41.141 --> 10:44.311
And Dragon just looks up,
and he's like, "Yeah, okay."

10:44.394 --> 10:46.355
Like, he's still in shock
that he even got shot.

10:52.653 --> 10:56.073
He was shot in a place that if
it was two or three inches right or left,

10:56.156 --> 10:57.866
then it would have been a fatal injury.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.869
It worked out, and he survived.

11:00.953 --> 11:02.579
And so, for that, we're fortunate.

11:04.540 --> 11:07.626
But had that been a fatal injury,

11:07.709 --> 11:10.003
there was an unwillingness to call it in

11:10.087 --> 11:13.715
out of fear of the consequences of being
in a place that's clearly forbidden.

11:16.844 --> 11:20.138
You're always gonna have
guys not agree with other guys' tactics.

11:20.222 --> 11:23.058
You should be expected
to be in some sort of danger.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.269
You can't mitigate all the risk.

11:25.352 --> 11:30.691
And it is war.
Bullets are gonna fly around regardless.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.526
As far as my thought process?

11:32.609 --> 11:37.281
Yeah, I'm willing to risk
my life or, you know,

11:37.364 --> 11:39.408
put my life in danger to get the job done.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.121
If that wound had been any different,

11:44.204 --> 11:47.416
or he had been killed,
Eddie's directly responsible.

11:48.792 --> 11:52.045
He was using us as bait, really.
Putting us in dangerous situations,

11:52.129 --> 11:54.715
trying to get us hurt
just so he could get a medal.

11:55.299 --> 11:58.302
And if we raised concern over it,
he'd be like, "You're being a pussy."

11:59.720 --> 12:02.014
But I still worked for him, right?
He had power over me.

12:02.097 --> 12:04.516
He had authority over me.
We still had a mission to do.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.143
So, I just kept my mouth shut.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.479
As time went on,

12:09.563 --> 12:12.316
Eddie created this divide between himself
and the rest of the platoon.

12:14.318 --> 12:15.402
It was very clear that

12:15.485 --> 12:18.197
the rift between the chief
and the platoon is growing.

12:32.169 --> 12:34.379
When we would get
care packages from our families,

12:34.963 --> 12:36.215
Eddie would go up to our rooms

12:36.298 --> 12:38.800
and take stuff out from under our beds
when we weren't there.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.680
It's not like a massively big deal,

12:44.223 --> 12:46.308
but it's not cool to go through
someone's stuff,

12:46.391 --> 12:49.186
especially in, like,
such a resource-constrained environment.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.521
People are gonna hate you.

12:52.147 --> 12:54.483
Sometimes you come up with
a nickname for your boss,

12:54.566 --> 12:58.445
and Eddie's nickname is El Diablo.
The Devil.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.740
We're all sitting here
working for this guy,

13:01.823 --> 13:03.784
and we're all fighting
this battle together.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.536
And we're all talking about

13:05.619 --> 13:08.747
what we're gonna do
when we go home to San Diego.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.374
I'm not doing that with Eddie Gallagher.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.000
He's a dick.

13:12.501 --> 13:16.088
I don't give a shit if you like me or not.
I have friends already.

13:16.171 --> 13:19.675
Like, I'm not looking to make new buddies.

13:19.758 --> 13:22.803
We can be cool, but I'm your chief.

13:22.886 --> 13:26.306
Other than that, if you don't want to have
a personal relationship with me,

13:26.390 --> 13:27.891
I could care less.

13:31.645 --> 13:34.565
NCIS Investigator:
It seems like, through the deployment,

13:34.648 --> 13:36.400
there was an obvious change in Eddie?

13:37.067 --> 13:38.819
He, like, started losing weight.

13:38.902 --> 13:42.114
He started looking really skinny.
He wasn't sleeping. Like,

13:42.197 --> 13:43.574
we would be, like, operating every day.

13:44.116 --> 13:45.659
And it was just go, go, go.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.578
And guys were worn out,
and he just wasn't.

13:48.203 --> 13:51.248
Obviously it doesn't take a scientist
to put two and two together.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.541
It's, like, that's not natural.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.086
We're always in pain. That's a fact.

13:56.170 --> 13:58.380
We run around day after day after day.

13:58.463 --> 14:01.258
Tramadol is
a great way to help some of that.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.386
The thing is,
Eddie didn't just need some tramadol.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.722
Eddie was doing
insane amounts of tramadol.

14:08.015 --> 14:11.268
He would wake up in the morning
just looking like a sack of crap.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.354
Just dragging his gear.
His magazines weren't loaded.

14:14.438 --> 14:16.440
We'd get in the car.
He wouldn't know the head count.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.150
He'd be like,
"You know where we're going?"

14:18.233 --> 14:21.195
And then he'd dig in his bag,
and he'd pop a pill in his mouth.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.363
And then, 20 minutes later or something,

14:23.447 --> 14:26.992
he's got that look in his eyes
like he's on something.

14:30.495 --> 14:33.207
On a day-to-day basis,
I saw very little of him

14:33.290 --> 14:36.376
because Eddie would often be
in a separate location,

14:36.460 --> 14:39.463
set up with the snipers,
which was very atypical for a chief.

14:41.173 --> 14:43.675
Eddie started spending
more and more time on the gun

14:43.759 --> 14:45.511
and less and less time being a chief.

14:46.512 --> 14:48.013
And as deployment went on,

14:48.096 --> 14:50.015
he got sucked into that gun
more and more and more

14:50.098 --> 14:52.643
to where he was just popping pills
and on the gun.

15:03.153 --> 15:05.322
The two buildings that we used primarily,

15:06.573 --> 15:11.078
you just had a clear, unobstructed view
of the entire old Mosul neighborhood.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.874
Dille: All right, what do we got?

15:16.458 --> 15:20.087
-Gio: It's like fucking sniper central.
-Yep.

15:20.170 --> 15:22.214
Dille:
Yeah. That's where I'm gonna set up.

15:26.718 --> 15:29.137
Dille: All right.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.975
Targeting the enemy with a sniper rifle,

15:33.058 --> 15:35.727
you get an up-close
and personal look at the people.

15:36.687 --> 15:39.773
We had been looking at the same streets
for, like, a couple of weeks.

15:39.857 --> 15:41.692
Like, we knew everyone
on the street block.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.279
We recognized people by their faces,
where they lived.

15:47.030 --> 15:50.075
And you're making decisions
about who's good and bad.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.746
For every one ISIS guy,

15:54.830 --> 15:58.000
there was that bell curve of people
who were in the gray area.

15:59.501 --> 16:02.880
That just really pulled at
every ounce of your soul,

16:02.963 --> 16:05.340
trying to decide
how to navigate that situation.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.886
Are those them right there?

16:09.386 --> 16:11.388
That's what I'm saying.
Those two white spots?

16:12.764 --> 16:14.391
It is highly unusual

16:14.474 --> 16:18.979
for a tactical lead or a chief to be
on the rifle all day long.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.649
And Eddie was on the rifle
every single day.

16:30.365 --> 16:32.618
Eddie was up there just blasting away.

16:34.786 --> 16:37.664
And we're like, "What is he shooting at?"

16:38.665 --> 16:40.959
We know that
Eddie's not seeing ISIS fighters.

16:42.503 --> 16:44.880
On a combat deployment, you have ROEs.

16:45.631 --> 16:47.466
ROEs are rules of engagement.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.552
And they did change during the deployment.

16:52.596 --> 16:54.932
Jake said, "Hey, we have intel that

16:55.015 --> 16:57.643
women are providing
material support to ISIS.

16:57.726 --> 17:00.270
And according to that,
they fall within our ROEs."

17:00.854 --> 17:04.066
And Eddie smiles and goes,
"Yeah, that means chicks are good to go."

17:04.147 --> 17:07.027
And Jake kind of looks at him
and was like,

17:07.108 --> 17:10.989
"Well, you know,
use your best judgment. I trust you."

17:17.162 --> 17:20.915
One day I was in the southern tower,
and Eddie was in the northern tower.

17:25.671 --> 17:29.633
And I see four young girls.
Twelve, 14 years old.

17:32.970 --> 17:35.722
And as soon as they came out
underneath that bridge,

17:35.806 --> 17:37.099
there's, like, a pathway.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.566
There was a shot taken,

17:45.649 --> 17:49.444
and I saw the girl
in the gray dress grab her stomach.

17:50.696 --> 17:53.240
And the girl
in the blue dress grabs her arm,

17:53.323 --> 17:54.950
and she looks right at our position.

17:57.828 --> 18:00.163
Immediately, I rolled over,

18:00.247 --> 18:04.168
and Jake was in my hide, and I was like,
"I think ISIS is shooting civilians."

18:06.295 --> 18:09.631
Later that day, I was walking
into the house with my ruck on.

18:09.715 --> 18:11.717
Joe Arrington was in front of me,
and I was like,

18:11.800 --> 18:14.636
"Man, Joe, I saw a little girl get shot
today under the bridge."

18:14.720 --> 18:17.222
And he turns around.
He looks me square in the eye and says,

18:17.306 --> 18:19.850
"That was Eddie.
Eddie told me he shot those girls today."

18:20.517 --> 18:22.102
And my jaw just dropped,

18:22.186 --> 18:24.813
and I was like, "You gotta be kidding me."

18:29.568 --> 18:32.321
All this suddenly clicked,
and it was a big revelation.

18:32.404 --> 18:34.406
Hey, maybe the times that Eddie said,

18:34.489 --> 18:36.450
"I shot five chicks today,"
bragging about it.

18:36.533 --> 18:39.119
Maybe he wasn't lying.
Maybe he was telling the truth.

18:41.079 --> 18:43.248
That was a huge day for me.

18:43.332 --> 18:48.128
My deployment completely changed.
I couldn't even look him in the eye.

18:48.212 --> 18:50.756
I'm just like,
"I'm frickin' done with you, man."

18:52.508 --> 18:54.551
They changed our ROEs

18:54.635 --> 18:58.347
with the expectation
that we are professional warriors.

18:58.430 --> 19:00.933
We know when to pull the trigger
and when not to.

19:01.016 --> 19:03.810
We know when to take the shot
and when not to.

19:03.894 --> 19:08.524
There is gray area, but there is also area
like shooting women on the Tigris River.

19:08.607 --> 19:10.817
That is not even remotely a gray area.

19:11.860 --> 19:16.657
Eddie came up to me after an operation.

19:16.740 --> 19:20.410
And said that he killed four women today.

19:20.494 --> 19:21.620
And--

19:22.412 --> 19:24.039
And I said,
"Why the fuck did you do that?"

19:25.415 --> 19:27.334
Craig was very conscientious,

19:27.417 --> 19:30.337
but in terms of moral leadership,
that was Craig.

19:30.420 --> 19:33.715
And he took that
on himself as his responsibility

19:33.799 --> 19:37.302
to figure out the best way to handle it
without compromising our platoon.

19:37.845 --> 19:39.596
I talked to Dylan Dille.

19:40.556 --> 19:42.182
"What the hell are we gonna, you know?

19:42.683 --> 19:44.393
What are we gonna do about this?"

19:45.269 --> 19:48.480
At that point, we took matters into our
own hands in the best way we could

19:48.564 --> 19:51.608
and just tried to shoot warning shots

19:51.692 --> 19:55.612
to scatter civilians
before Eddie could kill them.

19:56.864 --> 19:58.907
I was very close to Eddie

19:58.991 --> 20:02.536
when he was shooting into
a whole crowd of civilians.

20:02.619 --> 20:06.915
I saw Eddie shoot
at a woman along the river.

20:06.999 --> 20:11.295
I saw Eddie try to kill
a young teenage boy.

20:12.337 --> 20:13.338
It's fair to say that

20:13.422 --> 20:16.800
every man, woman and child
that came into his line of sight--

20:16.884 --> 20:17.885
He tried to kill 'em.

20:17.968 --> 20:18.844
It's freaking crazy.

20:29.354 --> 20:33.275
I was in the pink building
on Father's Day.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.946
I was scanning these various positions.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.700
And I just happened to scan back to

20:41.783 --> 20:44.453
a place that we referred to
as Murder Alley.

20:46.914 --> 20:50.542
As soon as my scope tracked to that spot,

20:51.043 --> 20:52.961
there's two old men standing on a corner.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.971
The shot goes off
and hits the guy on the right.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.935
I clearly saw the bullet strike his body,

21:08.018 --> 21:12.481
and then there was a red splotch
that big on his kidney area.

21:12.564 --> 21:14.858
He stood up and he was really wobbly,

21:15.442 --> 21:18.654
and he was, like,
grabbing on to all kinds of stuff

21:18.737 --> 21:21.782
to just try and walk and get out of there.

21:24.368 --> 21:27.454
Later, his spotter
for that engagement confirmed that

21:27.538 --> 21:29.164
it was Eddie that took that shot.

21:30.916 --> 21:35.587
It really weighed heavily on me
that I had failed.

21:35.671 --> 21:38.715
It felt like I should have been able
to stop that

21:38.799 --> 21:41.677
because we had been successful
so many other times,

21:41.760 --> 21:44.179
shooting warning shots,
getting civilians to scatter.

21:44.263 --> 21:45.556
Andâ€¦

21:45.639 --> 21:46.723
Iâ€¦

21:49.268 --> 21:50.561
I justâ€¦

21:53.564 --> 21:55.190
Yeah, it'sâ€¦

21:57.025 --> 21:58.277
You know, it's hard.

22:04.032 --> 22:06.159
We were there to protect civilians.

22:06.243 --> 22:09.329
Whether that's targeting ISIS
or keeping Eddie from getting 'em.

22:09.413 --> 22:12.249
And in the core of who I am,
that's what we were there to do.

22:12.332 --> 22:16.837
And when you fail to do that, it hurts.

22:21.675 --> 22:25.053
I didn't join the SEAL teams
to terrorize a civilian population.

22:25.137 --> 22:26.430
I joined to protect them.

22:26.513 --> 22:30.058
And at that point, I was like,
"Man, what are we doing here?"

22:45.282 --> 22:49.244
Did you ever
intentionally shoot any unarmed civilians?

22:49.328 --> 22:50.287
Eddie: No.

22:50.787 --> 22:53.540
Did you ever try to kill
an unarmed teenage boy?

22:54.333 --> 22:55.751
Eddie: No.

22:56.919 --> 22:59.129
Do you remember
ever shooting a little girl?

22:59.922 --> 23:00.923
Eddie: No.

23:01.924 --> 23:03.383
Their story is that

23:03.467 --> 23:06.220
I was popping pills
the whole deployment like a madman.

23:06.303 --> 23:08.764
I was shooting civilians left and right
in front of them.

23:09.348 --> 23:10.807
It's insane.

23:12.851 --> 23:16.480
Let's just sayâ€¦
everything they're saying is true.

23:16.563 --> 23:21.109
Why would they not report this up
to somebody?

23:21.193 --> 23:25.030
Like, "Hey, my chief is, like,
shooting civilians every day."

23:25.113 --> 23:29.284
But instead, they took it upon themselves
to shoot warning shots every day,

23:29.368 --> 23:31.119
trying to save the civilian populace?

23:31.203 --> 23:33.163
Like, that's-- It's absurd.

23:33.247 --> 23:34.706
It was reported.

23:34.790 --> 23:39.419
And, as a matter of fact,
on our deployment, the protocol,

23:39.503 --> 23:43.924
if you have an issue to report,
is you go to Craig Miller.

23:44.007 --> 23:47.845
Craig would go to Eddie.
Eddie would go to Jake.

23:47.928 --> 23:50.180
And then it would go up from there
if need be.

23:51.223 --> 23:53.183
The first problem
with that structure is that

23:53.267 --> 23:55.394
Eddie was the one committing the crimes.

23:55.477 --> 23:59.022
When we bypassed Eddie to go to Jake,
Jake did nothing.

24:00.524 --> 24:03.569
On multiple occasions,
we brought it up to Jake that,

24:03.652 --> 24:06.822
"Hey, just so you know,
Eddie is killing civilians,

24:06.905 --> 24:08.448
and we are not all right with it."

24:09.157 --> 24:11.660
As far as I know, on deployment,

24:11.743 --> 24:15.497
the allegations and complaints stopped
at Jake and never went higher.

24:18.876 --> 24:21.879
Warpinski:
Have you guys talked about or have fear

24:21.962 --> 24:24.715
that he was just targeting civilians?

24:24.798 --> 24:29.469
You could tell he was perfectly okay
with killing anybody that was moving.

24:29.553 --> 24:31.555
Warpinski:
Did he make comments regarding

24:31.638 --> 24:33.891
what his thoughts were on, like, Iraqis?

24:33.974 --> 24:37.477
Was it, like, a racial thing
where he just had no problem

24:37.561 --> 24:39.479
killing anyone in the Middle East at all,
I mean?

24:39.563 --> 24:43.650
I think he's justâ€¦
wants to kill anybody he can.

24:46.195 --> 24:48.530
You start off a deployment,
justifying, you know,

24:48.614 --> 24:53.202
the dream kill of the guy
with material wrapped around his face,

24:53.285 --> 24:55.996
with an AK,
and you're gonna take that guy out.

24:58.832 --> 25:01.960
Well, you don't see that.
So, maybe it's the guy without the gun.

25:02.044 --> 25:04.421
Maybe he's got a shovel
'cause he's digging for IEDs.

25:04.505 --> 25:07.633
And then maybe it's the guy
with a beard and no shovel.

25:07.716 --> 25:09.051
And then, you know--

25:09.134 --> 25:11.345
That bloodlust starts
to rationalize kills.

25:12.679 --> 25:15.390
And there was no accountability.

25:16.517 --> 25:20.145
You could kill anyone you wanted,
and you'd get away with it.

25:22.356 --> 25:24.942
And I think that's exactly what happened
with Eddie.

25:27.027 --> 25:29.404
You can't act
like a knight in shining armor

25:29.488 --> 25:31.782
and be like, "I'm a Boy Scout,
and I have all these ethics."

25:32.491 --> 25:35.911
ISIS, they use
the civilian populace to their advantage.

25:35.994 --> 25:37.454
They have them help them.

25:37.538 --> 25:42.292
It ranged from old men to women to kids.

25:42.376 --> 25:45.087
Moving weapons for them,
carrying guns for them.

25:45.170 --> 25:47.881
It's on you
if you're gonna engage that person or not.

25:49.842 --> 25:51.718
There can be, like,
a dilemma in that, I guess,

25:51.802 --> 25:53.387
if you start thinking about it.

25:53.470 --> 25:54.596
But it's war.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.935
If you can justify the shot,
and you can sleep well at night,

26:00.018 --> 26:01.812
then go ahead.

26:16.368 --> 26:17.619
Warpinski: All right. So,

26:18.495 --> 26:19.955
let's go back to

26:20.038 --> 26:22.374
why do you think you're here,
first of all?

26:23.208 --> 26:25.002
Scott: Probably for the prisoner incident.

26:25.085 --> 26:26.170
Warpinski: Okay.

26:27.462 --> 26:28.839
Dille: So, I guess probably

26:28.922 --> 26:31.967
the big incident
that everyone's talking about

26:32.050 --> 26:33.844
is the--

26:33.927 --> 26:36.263
-the prisoner issue.
-Okay.

26:39.474 --> 26:41.643
Warpinski:
Obviously this is some big shit, so

26:41.727 --> 26:43.812
take your time.

26:55.699 --> 26:56.992
Gio!

26:57.075 --> 26:58.285
Where's your spot, bro?

26:59.453 --> 27:03.123
May 3rd is a great day for me.
It's a great day for the platoon.

27:04.208 --> 27:07.878
One of the functions that I provide is
targeting information

27:07.961 --> 27:09.463
to my ground force commander.

27:10.339 --> 27:11.340
Where's your spot?

27:11.423 --> 27:12.799
It's over here.

27:15.385 --> 27:17.012
Right here is my spot.

27:18.472 --> 27:23.936
I developed this building
as being a known ISIS stronghold.

27:24.019 --> 27:28.398
And through our JTAC,
we were able to shoot two Hellfires in it.

27:36.156 --> 27:38.909
-Got him?
-Oh, yeah! Fuck yeah, dude!

27:38.992 --> 27:40.410
Yes!

27:40.494 --> 27:42.329
That was me, boys.

27:43.956 --> 27:45.499
And I got positive confirmation

27:45.582 --> 27:48.126
that we had just killed
basically a mid-level commander.

27:48.961 --> 27:51.046
The ISIS guy in charge, the captain,

27:51.129 --> 27:54.091
the dude that was fighting
Iraqis that day,

27:54.174 --> 27:57.970
got taken off the battlefield,
with a few of his cronies,

27:58.053 --> 27:59.555
in one air strike.

28:04.476 --> 28:05.644
The Iraqis go,

28:05.727 --> 28:08.730
and they recover
one of these fighters that's still alive

28:08.814 --> 28:10.357
from the site of this air strike.

28:14.611 --> 28:16.113
It came over the radio that

28:16.196 --> 28:21.034
there was a wounded ISIS fighter being
brought to us by the Iraqi partner force.

28:22.536 --> 28:27.374
And immediately,
everyone was like, "This is nuts."

28:27.457 --> 28:33.380
Our platoon has not received
a live ISIS fighter.

28:34.548 --> 28:38.385
Normally, these dudes are dead
well before we get there.

28:43.182 --> 28:46.143
The Iraqi partner force drives
up to our compound

28:46.226 --> 28:50.606
with a guy strapped to a stretcher
on the hood of a Humvee.

28:53.984 --> 28:57.237
I don't know why they brought him back
from up there in the front lines to us

28:57.321 --> 28:59.740
'cause they had never--
they hadn't done that before.

28:59.823 --> 29:02.868
But either way, it was like, "All right,
let's get a look at this dude."

29:06.205 --> 29:08.332
This is a celebratory moment for us.

29:09.166 --> 29:13.295
This is the first time that we have seen
the fruits of our labor up close.

29:13.378 --> 29:15.464
We never crossed the imaginary line

29:15.547 --> 29:18.759
to go actually physically touch
these guys.

29:18.842 --> 29:22.846
I wanna, like, see evil from two feet away

29:22.930 --> 29:25.599
and look into this guy's eyes.
And I asked TC. I was like,

29:25.682 --> 29:28.101
"Are you gonna film this?
This is gonna be crazy."

29:30.938 --> 29:32.439
But when they bring him in,

29:32.523 --> 29:35.234
it kind of immediately becomes clear

29:35.317 --> 29:39.196
it's a 80-pound middle-school-age kid.

29:41.865 --> 29:43.534
He had a wristwatch around his bicep.

29:46.245 --> 29:47.621
That's how skinny he was.

29:49.665 --> 29:51.625
And it's like, this is ugly.

29:52.543 --> 29:55.295
This ain't the grisly ISIS fighter
with a beard

29:55.379 --> 29:58.549
who just got done doing terrible things.

29:59.716 --> 30:01.343
This is like a rebellious kid.

30:04.137 --> 30:09.643
Then Eddie came over the radio and said,
"Nobody touch him. He's all mine."

30:13.188 --> 30:16.400
I hopped out of the vehicle
I was in and walked up.

30:16.483 --> 30:20.028
And there was a crowd
around this ISIS fighter.

30:20.112 --> 30:23.407
I saw he was fucked up, so I was like,

30:23.490 --> 30:26.827
"I'll get the med bag
and start treating this guy

30:26.910 --> 30:29.496
and see whatever information
we can get out of him later."

30:31.498 --> 30:34.042
Eddie came up and had a backpack.

30:35.502 --> 30:36.837
Eddie: I got it. I got him.

30:36.920 --> 30:37.921
I'm gonna treat him.

30:38.839 --> 30:42.176
He is a medic.
But I've never seen him treat anyone.

30:42.259 --> 30:44.928
He had never helped anyone to that point.

30:45.012 --> 30:47.097
And so, looking back,

30:47.181 --> 30:51.852
it should have been a red flag. Like,
"Hey, why's Eddie showing up right now?"

30:56.607 --> 30:58.233
Gio: Eddie's about to put him out, dude.

30:58.317 --> 30:59.318
Yeah.

30:59.401 --> 31:01.320
Yeah, I'm gonna help him.

31:01.403 --> 31:05.574
I say something that's very dark humorâ€¦

31:05.657 --> 31:08.327
Gio:
Hey, Eddie, this is from my SIGINT strike.

31:08.410 --> 31:10.078
Let me know if you need help.

31:10.162 --> 31:12.331
And the reason why I said that was

31:12.414 --> 31:14.708
because 30 seconds ago
we're trying to kill this guy.

31:14.791 --> 31:16.502
Now we're trying to save his life.

31:21.048 --> 31:22.299
What are they doing to him?

31:26.220 --> 31:28.764
I had no idea that TC turned off
his helmet camera.

31:28.847 --> 31:31.433
I have no idea
why he turned his helmet camera off.

31:32.851 --> 31:34.895
Warpinski: What happened after that?

31:37.105 --> 31:40.526
So I came over.
The kid had a wound on his leg.

31:42.194 --> 31:43.487
He had--

31:44.154 --> 31:45.697
I think he had a bandage on it.

31:45.781 --> 31:48.033
He had, like,
a chest tube in when I got there.

31:49.117 --> 31:50.619
And he was unconscious.

31:50.702 --> 31:52.996
And I think they did a crike
while I was there.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.122
Warpinski: Okay.

31:54.206 --> 31:58.585
Corey Scott was a medic,
and so he was so close to it all.

32:00.546 --> 32:04.091
He was right there,
watching Eddie treat the prisoner.

32:05.008 --> 32:06.593
Scott:
Usually when I'm working on somebody,

32:06.677 --> 32:09.346
you kind of sit,
like, kneel at their head.

32:10.180 --> 32:11.473
So that's where I was,

32:11.557 --> 32:13.684
like, kind of monitoring
his breathing, and

32:14.268 --> 32:17.354
just checking vitals on him, periodically.

32:18.188 --> 32:21.608
Warpinski: Did you think that they were
life-threatening injuries that he had?

32:21.692 --> 32:23.151
I don't think so.

32:23.235 --> 32:26.905
At that point in time, like,
he probably wasn't gonna die.

32:29.157 --> 32:30.492
And then

32:30.993 --> 32:34.329
all of a sudden
Eddie just starts stabbing the dude.

32:35.706 --> 32:39.042
Like, all of a sudden Eddie's, like,
stabbing this dude in the neck.

32:39.710 --> 32:42.546
Our medics were
working on him, and then

32:42.629 --> 32:44.673
he was on his last leg,

32:44.756 --> 32:46.842
and Eddie finished him.

32:47.885 --> 32:49.928
Warpinski: How did he finish him?
Did you actually see it happen?

32:50.012 --> 32:51.096
Yeah, I saw it happen.

32:51.722 --> 32:53.640
Warpinski:
What did you actually see Gallagher do?

32:54.474 --> 32:55.559
I saw him stab him.

32:55.642 --> 32:57.186
Warpinski:
Did you actually see him stab him?

32:57.269 --> 32:59.646
Or did you just walk up
after the guy was already dead?

32:59.730 --> 33:01.815
No, I saw him put
the knife into the guy's neck.

33:01.899 --> 33:03.734
I saw him put the knife in the neck.

33:04.401 --> 33:05.485
That's without a doubt.

33:06.278 --> 33:09.031
It was like a holy shit moment, like,

33:09.114 --> 33:10.449
no idea what to do.

33:10.532 --> 33:11.533
I kind of looked around.

33:11.617 --> 33:14.411
I was like,
"Who else is seeing this?" And then,

33:14.494 --> 33:17.789
like, I kind of stayed at the dude's head,
and then--

33:17.873 --> 33:20.667
like, for a few minutes until he died.

33:21.627 --> 33:27.382
There's nothing I could do at this point.
And so I left that scene

33:27.466 --> 33:28.425
and

33:29.426 --> 33:31.386
just tried to, like, catch my breath,

33:31.470 --> 33:35.974
and, like, try to, like,
just think about what I just saw.

33:38.727 --> 33:40.896
As I was walking back to the truck,

33:40.979 --> 33:44.900
Craig was just pissed off
and said something to the effect of,

33:44.983 --> 33:48.987
"This whole situation is fucked up."

33:50.113 --> 33:54.201
I saw the ISIS guy laying there, expired.

33:54.785 --> 33:57.037
I noticed that he had
a lot of work done to him.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.665
That there was
a tube sticking out of his neck.

33:59.748 --> 34:04.378
There was bandages and medical dressing
and wrappers all over the place.

34:05.879 --> 34:08.382
I was just repulsed
by the whole situation.

34:09.299 --> 34:11.552
You can't take a prisoner of war

34:11.635 --> 34:13.178
and then stab them in the neck.

34:13.262 --> 34:16.556
You can't do that,
according to the Geneva Convention.

34:16.639 --> 34:17.850
Everybody knows that.

34:17.933 --> 34:20.393
There isn't a single special operator

34:20.476 --> 34:22.603
that doesn't know
what he can and can't do.

34:24.106 --> 34:25.565
How do you handle that?

34:25.649 --> 34:28.110
Do you tackle your chief onto the ground?

34:28.193 --> 34:29.444
Take the knife from him?

34:31.237 --> 34:35.659
When someone is firing upon you,
you can fire back.

34:35.742 --> 34:39.079
But what makes us the best fighting force
in the world is that

34:39.161 --> 34:42.583
we have constraint
when they're laying there a prisoner.

34:42.666 --> 34:45.460
We're better than stooping to that level.

34:46.128 --> 34:47.295
The level of ISIS.

34:48.755 --> 34:51.466
We hold ourselves to a higher standard
because we can.

34:57.556 --> 34:59.808
Corey Scott says that you

34:59.892 --> 35:01.643
suddenly walked over, pulled out a knife

35:01.727 --> 35:04.146
and stabbed the detainee
in the neck, twice.

35:06.106 --> 35:08.483
No, I did not stab him in the neck.

35:08.567 --> 35:13.238
I'll say, once the IO chest--

35:13.322 --> 35:15.616
the IO was put in,

35:15.699 --> 35:17.367
the guy did not flinch.

35:17.451 --> 35:19.703
I was like, "Is this guy dead?"

35:19.786 --> 35:22.748
He's-- Obviously,
I was like, "I think he's gone."

35:23.874 --> 35:27.628
Corey was like, "Yeah, I think he is too."

35:28.795 --> 35:32.591
I was like, "All right, check to see--
Check for a pulse."

35:32.674 --> 35:35.469
I had leaned down or got on my knees

35:35.552 --> 35:38.472
and thumped him in the eye
to see if there was any reaction.

35:39.640 --> 35:43.393
I couldn't tell if he moved or whatever
when I thumped him or not.

35:44.853 --> 35:46.688
But we were pretty positive.

35:46.772 --> 35:48.440
Like, all right, this guy's gone.

35:48.524 --> 35:50.359
At that point, I pulled a knife out,

35:50.442 --> 35:54.530
and I poked him in the side of the ribs
where he had a wound.

35:54.613 --> 35:58.075
His shirt was still there, so I--
There was no skin broken or anything.

35:58.158 --> 36:02.704
I just jabbed him real quick. No movement.
And that was it. I literally put it away.

36:02.788 --> 36:06.875
I was like, "This dude is done."
And that's all that happened.

36:09.211 --> 36:13.173
Warpinski: What happened on scene
after Gallagher stabbed this individual?

36:14.341 --> 36:16.885
You know, after this whole thing,

36:16.969 --> 36:19.179
I think photographs were taken.

36:19.263 --> 36:21.890
And at one point,

36:22.933 --> 36:25.519
it was like,
"Hey, we're taking a group picture."

36:27.646 --> 36:29.314
I was sitting in the truck,

36:29.398 --> 36:33.569
and Jake says,
"Hey, De-de, we're taking a photo."

36:33.652 --> 36:35.737
And I immediately was like,

36:36.405 --> 36:39.366
"Nope. I know what this is--
I-- I can see where this is going."

36:39.449 --> 36:42.828
He asked me one more time.
Like, "Hey, get in this photo."

36:42.911 --> 36:45.497
And I was like, "Jake,
I'm not getting in the fucking picture."

36:47.749 --> 36:51.461
I got out of the truck
and watched from the edge.

36:56.758 --> 37:00.387
And then Jake was reading
Eddie Gallagher's reenlistment ceremony

37:00.470 --> 37:02.848
over this dead ISIS fighter's body.

37:04.892 --> 37:06.727
I wanted to reenlist in a combat zone.

37:06.810 --> 37:08.645
It's where I had reenlisted before.

37:09.188 --> 37:12.232
And Jake was like, "We have free time now.
Do you want to reenlist now?"

37:12.316 --> 37:14.526
And I was like,
"Yeah, let's-- All right. Awesome idea."

37:16.278 --> 37:18.322
When you reenlist,
you raise your right hand.

37:18.405 --> 37:20.240
Swear the oath again.

37:20.324 --> 37:23.160
I'm gonna give five more years
of my life to this job.

37:23.744 --> 37:26.955
That's, like, the ceremony,
and I was able to get it done.

37:27.873 --> 37:30.459
There just happened to be
a dead ISIS fighter there.

37:33.629 --> 37:36.632
When we were driving back from that day,

37:36.715 --> 37:38.926
I thought we were done operating.

37:39.009 --> 37:43.263
I thought there was too many people
taking selfies, taking photos.

37:44.139 --> 37:48.310
Some international law enforcement
is gonna show up tomorrow morning.

37:48.393 --> 37:50.562
I thought I was gonna be
in trouble just for being there.

37:53.232 --> 37:55.484
I was like, "It's not if this gets out,

37:55.567 --> 37:56.777
it's when it gets out."

37:56.860 --> 38:02.074
Because Eddie is way too narcissistic
to keep that internal.

38:03.450 --> 38:08.163
The gravity of the situation,
I think, began to manifest itself.

38:08.247 --> 38:10.624
Like, we are so screwed.

38:10.707 --> 38:12.209
Like, we're all going to jail.

38:12.292 --> 38:14.044
Like, we're done.

38:17.172 --> 38:20.551
Craig called the meeting
and is talking about,

38:20.634 --> 38:24.221
"Hey, I'm not all right with this.
Who else isn't all right with it?"

38:24.304 --> 38:26.473
And a bunch of hands raise.

38:27.558 --> 38:30.394
Craig's like, "I'm telling you right now,
this is not Alpha Platoon.

38:30.477 --> 38:32.980
This is not what we do.
This is not why we came here.

38:33.063 --> 38:34.398
And it's not gonna happen again."

38:35.691 --> 38:38.861
At some point, Corey Scott,
he said something to the effect of,

38:38.944 --> 38:43.448
"I don't want the video of me assisting
Eddie with war crimes floating around."

38:43.532 --> 38:45.701
And then Gio was like, "Hey.

38:45.784 --> 38:48.579
Let's not throw around
this word 'war crimes.'"

38:48.662 --> 38:51.832
And I absolutely said, "Absolutely not.
That's not a war crime.

38:51.915 --> 38:54.084
Don't even say that.
Like, you have no idea,

38:54.168 --> 38:57.254
when you start throwing around
those terms,

38:57.337 --> 38:58.547
what can come from it."

38:59.590 --> 39:02.676
At which point Eddie walked in,
right at that moment.

39:05.637 --> 39:10.475
And he said, "All right,
all senior E-6s in my room, right now."

39:14.062 --> 39:15.898
He sat down, and he said,

39:15.981 --> 39:19.193
"I don't know
why you guys are not okay with this.

39:19.776 --> 39:22.362
ISIS does terrible things to kids.

39:22.446 --> 39:25.991
The fact that you guys are upset with this
is completely fucked up,

39:26.074 --> 39:27.868
but I get it.

39:27.951 --> 39:31.622
So, next time I do this,
it'll be out of sight, out of mind,

39:31.705 --> 39:33.999
and you won't even have
to know that it happened."

39:35.000 --> 39:40.130
I think he's taking what I said
and again distorting it.

39:40.214 --> 39:43.258
But I definitely said
something along the lines of, like,

39:43.342 --> 39:45.260
"Hey, yeah, if you're not cool
with what happened,

39:45.344 --> 39:48.013
if you have a problem with it,
that's your prerogative.

39:48.096 --> 39:49.723
Like, that's fine."

39:49.806 --> 39:53.143
And that's when I was like,
"You know, delete it."

39:53.727 --> 39:56.730
Never once did they say,
"We're not good with the stabbing."

39:56.813 --> 39:59.066
Or we're not good with
whatever they were accusing me of.

39:59.149 --> 40:01.235
It was the pictures the whole time.

40:03.695 --> 40:07.366
There is no doubt
in anyone's mind what happened.

40:08.158 --> 40:10.077
Eddie came in bragging about it.

40:10.160 --> 40:12.246
The debate wasn't,
"Did Eddie kill a prisoner?"

40:12.329 --> 40:15.332
The debate was "Eddie killed
a prisoner, but is that okay?"

40:17.960 --> 40:21.588
There's no training of
how to report your chief for war crimes.

40:22.214 --> 40:23.882
Outside of going to Jake,

40:23.966 --> 40:26.468
it didn't seem like
we had any other options.

40:26.552 --> 40:29.596
And so I felt pretty trapped
and that nothing was gonna get done

40:29.680 --> 40:32.140
until we could get home
and talk to people who cared.

40:33.642 --> 40:37.813
Everybody knew that
the backlash was going to be intense.

40:37.896 --> 40:42.234
Like, this was gonna have catastrophic
consequences to Naval Special Warfare.

40:42.818 --> 40:45.237
We just didn't know
how big the damage was gonna be.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.807
Shortly after getting back
from deployment,

41:13.891 --> 41:16.935
a text thread was started
called the Sewing Circle.

41:17.477 --> 41:21.815
That text message thread was
essentially just a group of guys

41:21.899 --> 41:23.984
that were really upset with
what happened on deployment

41:24.067 --> 41:25.819
and didn't know what to do.

41:45.214 --> 41:48.258
No one was holding anything back
from any SEAL who said,

41:48.342 --> 41:49.968
"Hey, how was deployment?"

41:51.261 --> 41:54.598
If you're a SEAL and you could possibly be
serving under Eddie Gallagher,

41:54.681 --> 41:56.391
you need to know this information.

41:58.268 --> 42:01.438
These stories that started
to permeate through the community

42:01.522 --> 42:04.483
came back to Eddie, and he was just livid.

42:06.818 --> 42:10.030
As soon as I got back,
I had two guys come up to me

42:10.113 --> 42:11.990
from other platoons telling me that,

42:12.074 --> 42:15.786
"Hey, some of your guys in your platoon
are running their mouth about you."

42:15.869 --> 42:18.872
And they're saying that I was putting them
in dangerous situations.

42:19.665 --> 42:22.751
And the big thing was that I was a thief.

42:22.835 --> 42:25.921
Which is the first time I was like,
"Wait a minute. I'm a--"

42:26.004 --> 42:27.673
Like, they called me--
Like, the aggressiveness

42:27.756 --> 42:30.384
and putting them and me in bad situations,
I was like, "Whatever."

42:30.467 --> 42:33.554
But being called a thief,
that really pissed me off.

43:01.290 --> 43:02.791
It all started to come to a head,

43:02.875 --> 43:05.919
probably within a week of
us getting back home.

43:06.003 --> 43:09.590
I think that Eddie started to hear
what people had been talking about.

43:09.673 --> 43:10.841
Hearing it from other sources.

43:10.924 --> 43:15.637
It clearly bothered him,
and he convened a meeting in the high-bay.

43:21.101 --> 43:23.312
I said, "Let's get this out in the open.

43:23.395 --> 43:25.272
I've been hearing a lot of rumors.

43:26.148 --> 43:27.357
Being called a thief.

43:28.233 --> 43:29.818
You don't like my tactics.

43:30.611 --> 43:32.112
Just get it all out right now.

43:33.113 --> 43:34.323
Tell me what I stole

43:34.406 --> 43:36.158
because I've never been called
a thief before.

43:36.241 --> 43:37.993
That's what I'm most pissed about."

43:38.076 --> 43:40.245
And in my mind, I'm like,
"Dude, I called you a murderer

43:40.329 --> 43:42.497
and a lot of other things
worse than a thief."

43:43.749 --> 43:47.085
Vriens brought up that
he thought my tactics were dangerous.

43:48.504 --> 43:52.508
And I told him,
since he's on his second platoon,

43:52.591 --> 43:56.220
that he was so experienced
and all of his knowledge.

43:56.303 --> 43:58.931
I was like, "I'm not gonna get into
a debate about-- with tactics

43:59.014 --> 44:00.015
with you."

44:00.724 --> 44:03.143
Eddie came down,
tried to control the conversation

44:03.227 --> 44:05.979
and base it around
PowerBars and cookie butter.

44:06.063 --> 44:08.565
But when we brought up
some of the other stuff,

44:08.649 --> 44:10.609
he didn't even want to talk about it.

44:10.692 --> 44:12.402
We didn't even get to the civilians

44:12.486 --> 44:14.196
or the prisoner in that conversation.

44:15.572 --> 44:18.200
Eddie had said, "Look,
the way that we conducted ourselves,

44:18.283 --> 44:19.535
that's just your opinion.

44:19.618 --> 44:22.788
And when you're a chief,
then you can make those decisions."

44:23.789 --> 44:27.918
And after the meeting ended,
and Eddie left, I remember saying,

44:28.001 --> 44:31.046
"The Law of Armed Conflict
is not an opinion."

44:32.965 --> 44:35.843
It's a very rare occurrence that SEALs are

44:35.926 --> 44:37.719
going against one of their own.

44:37.803 --> 44:40.639
So navigating the process was
completely foreign.

44:40.722 --> 44:44.893
We always wanted to handle it
at the lowest level possible

44:44.977 --> 44:48.814
and cause the least damage
to the SEAL teams as possible.

44:50.774 --> 44:53.986
So Craig immediately
went to Jake and said,

44:54.069 --> 44:58.615
"Jake, I'm using my chain of command.
I'm going to you first.

44:58.699 --> 45:01.326
The guys aren't happy with
what happened on deployment,

45:01.410 --> 45:03.662
and it's got to be rectified."

45:16.800 --> 45:18.594
When Jake came back, he was like, "Listen,

45:18.677 --> 45:22.222
these guys bombarded me,
getting me to, like, turn on you."

45:22.306 --> 45:24.516
And they were also telling Jake
a bunch of lies.

45:25.559 --> 45:28.145
Telling Jake
that I manipulated him, that--

45:28.228 --> 45:31.773
They're trying to get in his head.
And he admitted-- He was like,

45:31.857 --> 45:35.319
"At first I started getting
mad at you, but now I'm back.

45:35.402 --> 45:36.945
I know this is all-- It's all bullshit."

45:55.339 --> 45:57.299
Jake was completely on Eddie's side.

45:57.382 --> 46:00.260
So, it was clear that
Jake was just gonna cover for Eddie.

46:01.637 --> 46:03.430
Everything that we're given
during training is

46:03.514 --> 46:05.015
"report it to your chain of command."

46:05.098 --> 46:08.352
Great. So we reported to our chain of
command several times, several times.

46:08.435 --> 46:10.103
Just keeps getting kicked back down to us.

46:11.230 --> 46:12.523
And then, at that point

46:12.606 --> 46:16.735
we reported it to our troop SEA,
Master Chief Alazzawi.

46:17.611 --> 46:19.571
He came up to me personally, and he said,

46:19.655 --> 46:23.534
"Hey, man, we can't have guys that are
shooting little girls in SEAL teams.

46:23.617 --> 46:25.827
All right? So don't worry about this.
I'm going to handle this."

46:27.246 --> 46:29.122
Unfortunately, that didn't happen.

46:29.206 --> 46:31.500
Warpinski: We need to go through,
and figure out what you heard.

46:31.583 --> 46:34.044
What your interactions have been
with SOC Gallagher,

46:34.127 --> 46:35.712
looking into this investigation.

46:35.796 --> 46:37.047
Overall, great platoon.

46:37.130 --> 46:38.507
I don't know if you need this or not.

46:38.590 --> 46:40.133
I mean, they were
a great platoon on paper.

46:40.217 --> 46:44.179
At the time,
Eddie Gallagher was a rock star.

46:44.972 --> 46:49.434
Alazzawi and I's relationship was good.
He came over and pulled me out,

46:49.518 --> 46:51.270
and we sat down in a room.

46:51.353 --> 46:56.108
And he said, "Listen, these guys came
to me with these accusations."

46:56.900 --> 46:59.111
Warpinski: Did you ever ask him
what happened that day?

47:00.362 --> 47:02.239
In not so many words. I said,

47:02.322 --> 47:04.157
"Hey, man. The guys are coming out with

47:04.241 --> 47:06.577
some pretty strong allegations
against you."

47:06.660 --> 47:10.956
And he said, "Whatever it is that
they're talking about, I can clear it.

47:11.039 --> 47:13.667
-I'm comfortable that I can clear it."
-Okay.

47:15.669 --> 47:18.422
It definitely felt like
he had the full backing of the command.

47:18.505 --> 47:21.008
We didn't have friends
that were master chiefs that had our back

47:21.091 --> 47:22.092
like Eddie did.

47:23.051 --> 47:26.263
Everything gets reported multiple times,
and nothing happens.

47:26.346 --> 47:29.892
Nothing happens. Nothing happens.
And that process took six months.

47:31.351 --> 47:33.979
And then we find out that
Eddie was in a command

47:34.062 --> 47:36.648
where he was running
the classes for new officers.

47:37.399 --> 47:40.152
There was obviously nothing being done,

47:40.235 --> 47:43.780
and I think they just hoped that
nothing was going to be done.

47:45.032 --> 47:47.117
When Eddie went over to the SOUC,

47:47.201 --> 47:50.204
which is our Special Operations
and Urban Combat,

47:50.287 --> 47:52.539
he was put in a position of power

47:52.623 --> 47:54.958
where he was gonna be able
to influence everyone,

47:55.042 --> 47:58.504
not just Team 7,
but all the West Coast teams.

47:58.587 --> 48:01.131
It was an incentive
to blow the whistle against him.

48:01.840 --> 48:03.759
If we didn't do something

48:03.842 --> 48:07.387
and force these situations
to get brought to a higher level,

48:07.471 --> 48:10.182
Eddie could potentially lead more SEALs,

48:10.265 --> 48:13.894
put SEALs in harm's way,
and kill more civilians.

48:13.977 --> 48:16.647
And that was too much weight
for anyone to bear.

48:16.730 --> 48:18.023
And so it-- you know,

48:18.106 --> 48:23.153
it was time to elevate
the situation as a whole.

48:25.280 --> 48:30.744
Master Chief Alazzawi sat down with us
and said, "Here's the deal, guys.

48:30.827 --> 48:34.039
Just know that if you do
a NCIS investigation,

48:34.122 --> 48:35.791
there's gonna be a huge frag radius."

48:35.874 --> 48:37.876
Meaning maybe
a lot of people get in trouble.

48:37.960 --> 48:40.546
A frag radius is like,
when you're talking about a hand grenade,

48:40.629 --> 48:43.298
how far out
the shrapnel is gonna get thrown,

48:43.382 --> 48:45.759
and how far out
people are gonna get fragged

48:45.843 --> 48:47.427
from the center of impact, right?

48:47.511 --> 48:49.221
So, if Eddie's the center of impact,

48:49.304 --> 48:51.807
how many other people
are gonna get hurt by this investigation?

48:51.890 --> 48:53.225
We were fully aware of that.

48:53.308 --> 48:55.227
We knew that there were pictures,

48:55.310 --> 48:57.521
and we said, "You know what?

48:57.604 --> 48:59.022
So what if we get in trouble?

48:59.106 --> 49:02.401
There's something bigger here,
and it needs to be done."

49:02.484 --> 49:04.778
I called a meeting with the boys.

49:04.862 --> 49:05.821
We were like,

49:05.904 --> 49:08.156
-"Hey, fellas, this is an NCIS problem."
-Okay.

49:08.240 --> 49:10.576
"Take it to the 1-800 hotline.
Make a call.

49:10.659 --> 49:12.035
That's how it gets investigated."

49:12.119 --> 49:14.580
I'm like, "Fellas, you guys understand

49:14.663 --> 49:17.624
the frag radius on this is fucking major.

49:17.708 --> 49:18.959
Like,

49:19.042 --> 49:20.043
here we go."

49:24.339 --> 49:27.426
We all met up in the BUD/S classroom.

49:28.886 --> 49:30.596
There was ten of us in there.

49:31.430 --> 49:33.557
We basically took a vote and said,

49:33.640 --> 49:36.185
"Who's in favor of
launching an investigation?"

49:38.103 --> 49:42.357
Speaking out against our chief
comes with huge consequences.

49:43.233 --> 49:45.027
Tons of things were at risk.

49:45.110 --> 49:47.571
Reputation, career.

49:47.654 --> 49:51.033
Just the feeling of being a "snitch."

49:51.116 --> 49:52.534
Putting my family in danger.

49:53.076 --> 49:56.455
And I kept asking myself, like,
"What the heck am I doing?"

49:57.581 --> 50:00.042
We knew that it was gonna get really ugly.

50:00.125 --> 50:03.170
Everyone's worried about, kind of,
what's gonna happen from the fallout.

50:03.253 --> 50:04.546
Are we prepared for this?

50:04.630 --> 50:07.216
I think everyone just wanted to know
we all had each other's back.

50:07.299 --> 50:09.009
Everyone's gonna stick together
through this.

50:10.469 --> 50:13.889
I actually looked at Corey
to see if he was okay with this

50:13.972 --> 50:15.724
because he was so close to it all.

50:15.807 --> 50:18.727
And he put his hand up right away.

50:19.686 --> 50:22.648
Corey Scott was actually the big push.

50:22.731 --> 50:24.149
His exact words were something like,

50:24.233 --> 50:26.985
"If Eddie goes on
and does another deployment

50:27.069 --> 50:29.738
and gets one of our students
hurt or killed,

50:30.322 --> 50:32.241
how could we look
their parents in the eyes,

50:32.324 --> 50:33.992
knowing that we could've stopped him?"

50:34.535 --> 50:38.080
And I was like, "Hell yeah,
let's go to war, boys. I don't care

50:38.163 --> 50:40.874
how many master chiefs
and officers don't agree with us.

50:40.958 --> 50:43.043
I know what I saw.

50:43.126 --> 50:45.879
You guys know what you saw.
Let's do this."

50:53.929 --> 50:56.598
Warpinski: So you guys have been trying
to report this since you got back,

50:56.682 --> 50:57.599
basically?

50:57.683 --> 51:01.436
Yeah. It was, I mean,

51:01.520 --> 51:05.691
a very, like, challenging thing
for us to deal with. And, like,

51:05.774 --> 51:09.194
we're trying to report it to people

51:09.278 --> 51:11.947
and then get it dealt with,
and it just gets pushed back down.

51:12.030 --> 51:14.741
This thing has been, you know,

51:14.825 --> 51:17.327
a weight on a lot of people
for a long time.

51:18.036 --> 51:19.079
The big purging,

51:19.162 --> 51:22.958
and the big weight off my shoulders was
when I reported everything to NCIS.

51:23.667 --> 51:27.629
Because I knew that that set
something in motion that was huge.

51:28.797 --> 51:33.177
But I was also expecting that
as soon as this all got out

51:33.260 --> 51:36.054
that Eddie would just try
and silence everyone.

52:19.139 --> 52:21.725
NCIS Investigator: Do you believe
that the guys back in San Diego

52:21.808 --> 52:23.810
are at risk from him?

52:23.894 --> 52:25.145
TC: Yeah, I do.

52:25.229 --> 52:26.480
I think their families are.

52:26.563 --> 52:28.148
Stoner: I think he's a dangerous person.

52:28.232 --> 52:32.486
And I think if heâ€¦ if he gets the chance,

52:32.569 --> 52:34.655
he might act upon that.

52:38.116 --> 52:39.785
We were in fear for our safety

52:39.868 --> 52:43.539
because Eddie Gallagher was
consistently going past our house.

52:44.998 --> 52:46.542
It came to the point where

52:46.625 --> 52:49.127
I was going to put
my young child in the car,

52:49.211 --> 52:50.796
and I'm stepping out my front door.

52:50.879 --> 52:52.673
And here comes Eddie, smiling at me.

52:53.549 --> 52:56.051
Kind of letting me know that
he knew where I lived.

52:56.677 --> 52:59.054
So I'm going to protect my family
how I need to protect them.

53:00.389 --> 53:04.351
The day after I gave an NCIS interview,

53:04.434 --> 53:09.231
I went straight to the gun store
and bought a home defense weapon.

53:09.314 --> 53:12.693
I think everyone felt
the pressure to beef up their self-defense

53:12.776 --> 53:16.530
and be ready for a retaliatory action.

53:24.496 --> 53:27.124
Not once had I threatened any of them.

53:27.207 --> 53:29.710
I literally made sure
I didn't have contact with any of them.

53:30.836 --> 53:32.796
I was done talking to them.

53:34.256 --> 53:39.094
Am I dangerous? Yeah, I can be dangerous
if you force me to get to that level.

53:54.193 --> 53:55.944
Warpinski:
What kind of knife did Eddie carry?

53:56.028 --> 53:58.322
Vriens: It was Half Face Blades.

53:58.405 --> 54:00.908
Warpinski: Did you ever see that knife
after the deployment?

54:00.991 --> 54:03.118
After deployment? No.

54:03.202 --> 54:06.038
Warpinski: Do you think
he still has it, realistically?

54:06.121 --> 54:08.832
I would put money on it
that he has the knife still.

54:08.916 --> 54:10.918
Whether it's at his house,
whether he framed it,

54:11.001 --> 54:13.086
whether it's still in his go box,
I don't know.

54:17.090 --> 54:20.260
I get a phone call to come into work,

54:20.344 --> 54:24.640
and there was
about six NCIS agents in there.

54:24.723 --> 54:26.558
And they took me
over to an interrogation room,

54:26.642 --> 54:31.355
and that's where Joe Warpinski came in
and said that I was being investigated.

54:31.438 --> 54:34.483
Warpinski: What we're going
to talk about today is that there are

54:34.566 --> 54:37.319
issues with a case involving

54:37.402 --> 54:39.238
the Law of Armed Conflict
and a murder case.

54:39.321 --> 54:42.950
Eddie: Just so--
No disrespect to you guys or anything,

54:43.033 --> 54:47.079
but I've been advised not to answer
any questions without my lawyer.

54:48.205 --> 54:49.706
Like, at all. And I don't--

54:49.790 --> 54:52.209
I'm not trying to sound like a dick.
I justâ€¦

54:52.292 --> 54:54.086
have never gone through
any of this stuff before.

54:54.169 --> 54:55.546
Warpinski: Okay, we'll be back.

54:58.674 --> 55:01.844
They left the room
and didn't come back for seven hours.

55:05.931 --> 55:07.516
My daughter called me.

55:07.599 --> 55:11.562
She's like, "Mom, where are you?
The boys are outside in their underwear.

55:11.645 --> 55:13.146
There is police everywhere."

55:15.941 --> 55:18.151
And I'm like,
"What are you talking about?"

55:21.488 --> 55:24.950
I arrive on the scene.
It looks like something out of a movie.

55:25.742 --> 55:28.912
There's, like,
seven to ten armored vehicles.

55:29.538 --> 55:31.081
There's people that look like

55:31.164 --> 55:34.501
they're literally going to war
in full militia riot gear.

55:34.585 --> 55:37.087
There's people just streaming
out of my house.

55:43.510 --> 55:46.096
When they raided his house,

55:46.180 --> 55:47.973
they found his knife.

55:49.433 --> 55:53.687
And they found, from his own phone
to his friends, a text message.

55:58.942 --> 56:02.821
I knew that that picture and that text,

56:02.905 --> 56:06.074
which was sent to one of my best friends,
looked pretty damning.

56:06.158 --> 56:07.951
But it was dark humor.

56:08.035 --> 56:10.662
I wish I would have never,
like, said that,

56:10.746 --> 56:13.832
but it was now being used against me.
Like, "See, he admitted to it."

56:14.625 --> 56:15.834
That's when I knew.

56:15.918 --> 56:18.545
I was like, "I'm getting fucked."

56:19.505 --> 56:23.383
Unfortunately for NCIS,
they messed with the wrong family.
