(TAPE RECORDER CLICKS)

00:50.634 --> 00:53.228
BRANDO:
This is the beginning of the tape.

00:53.345 --> 00:58.397
We're on mono and we're on microphone 1.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.320
Okay.

01:02.437 --> 01:03.563
Now listen,

01:03.689 --> 01:06.158
let me tell you something that I did.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.329
I've had my head digitized.

01:11.488 --> 01:12.831
And they put this laser

01:12.948 --> 01:14.746
and it goes around you like this...

01:14.866 --> 01:16.834
and they digitized my face.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.920
And I made a lot of faces

01:19.079 --> 01:21.252
and smiled and...

01:21.373 --> 01:23.671
and made a sad face and...

01:23.792 --> 01:25.794
So they've got it all on digital.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.468
And actors are not going to be real,

01:28.589 --> 01:30.933
they're going to be inside a computer.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.469
You watch, it's gonna happen.

01:33.594 --> 01:37.189
So maybe this is the swan song
for all of us.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.993
(ELECTRONIC NOISES)

02:05.167 --> 02:08.420
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...

02:09.920 --> 02:11.514
creeps in this petty pace

02:11.632 --> 02:13.134
from day to day,

02:14.176 --> 02:16.895
to the last syllable of recorded time;

02:18.388 --> 02:20.516
and all our yesterdays

02:20.641 --> 02:23.895
have lighted fools the way
to dusty death.

02:24.853 --> 02:28.778
Out, out, brief candle.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.865
Life's but a walking shadow,

02:31.985 --> 02:36.786
a poor player, that struts
and frets his hour upon the stage,

02:36.948 --> 02:39.451
and then is heard no more.

02:40.619 --> 02:44.374
It is a tale told by an idiot,

02:45.624 --> 02:48.468
full of sound

02:48.585 --> 02:52.465
and fury,
signifying...

02:55.676 --> 02:56.848
nothing.

02:59.471 --> 03:02.975
POLICE OFFICER: Copy. All available
units responding to a shooting.

03:03.100 --> 03:06.354
MALE REPORTER:
Police came to a call to 911,

03:06.478 --> 03:08.572
but this was no ordinary address,

03:08.689 --> 03:10.862
the caller no ordinary citizen.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.531
Marlon Brando was on the line

03:13.652 --> 03:15.700
to report a shooting at his home.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.415
Misery...

03:22.452 --> 03:25.080
has come to my house.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.709
FEMALE REPORTER: Brando won an Oscar

03:28.834 --> 03:30.336
for his performance in the 1954 film

03:30.460 --> 03:31.507
<i>On the Waterfront.</i>

03:31.628 --> 03:33.255
He was already being acclaimed

03:33.380 --> 03:36.008
as the greatest American
film actor ever.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.386
You take the good goods away,
and the kickbacks

03:38.552 --> 03:39.804
and the shakedown cabbage

03:39.928 --> 03:42.272
and them pistoleros and you're nothin'.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.813
Hey, Stella.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.403
INTERVIEWER:
You can bet that Marlon Brando's impact

03:48.520 --> 03:49.692
on the world of movie acting

03:49.813 --> 03:51.861
will still be felt 500 years from now.

03:52.023 --> 03:54.572
I'm gonna make him an offer
he can't refuse.

03:56.528 --> 03:57.996
<i>MALE REPORTER: Marlon Brando was here</i>

03:58.113 --> 03:59.660
at his home at the time of the shooting,

03:59.781 --> 04:03.001
but police who questioned the actor
say he did not witness it.

04:03.952 --> 04:06.626
MALE REPORTER 2: The shooting
put a spotlight on the private life

04:06.747 --> 04:10.126
of one of Hollywood's
most reclusive stars.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.718
BRANDO: And it's been a struggle

04:11.835 --> 04:13.803
to try to preserve sanity

04:13.962 --> 04:15.555
and sense of reality

04:15.672 --> 04:18.425
that is taken away from you by success.

04:38.195 --> 04:41.369
BRANDO: It will be
a highly personalized documentary

04:41.490 --> 04:45.836
on the life activities of myself,
Marlon Brando.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.213
We establish that he is a troubled man,

04:52.375 --> 04:56.972
alone, beset with memories,

04:57.088 --> 05:01.969
in a state of confusion and sadness,

05:02.093 --> 05:04.812
isolation, disorder.

05:07.432 --> 05:10.060
He's wounded beyond being able

05:10.227 --> 05:12.901
to be social in an ordinary way,

05:13.021 --> 05:16.116
he becomes like a mechanical doll.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.364
Maybe he felt that he was treated badly.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.658
And that he's angry about the treatment.

05:24.825 --> 05:29.376
He's collecting bits
of information here, odd bits of film

05:29.496 --> 05:32.796
to try to explain why are you this way?

05:37.504 --> 05:42.351
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

05:42.467 --> 05:47.439
five, four, three, two, one.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.861
Now let your mind drift

05:53.019 --> 05:54.236
back,

05:54.396 --> 05:56.364
way back in time

05:57.732 --> 06:00.030
to a time when you were very young,

06:00.151 --> 06:03.155
when you used to wake up in the morning,

06:03.280 --> 06:04.748
put on your clothes

06:04.865 --> 06:06.583
while everyone was sleeping,

06:07.659 --> 06:11.664
and walk down the sidewalk in Omaha

06:11.830 --> 06:14.379
and sit underneath that big elm tree.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.799
With the wind blowing the light,

06:18.920 --> 06:20.672
the shadow of leaves.

06:21.756 --> 06:25.386
It is like a wonderful, soft dream

06:25.510 --> 06:27.262
and that soft wind calling.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.899
That's a wind that you can trust.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.321
You are the memories.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.874
I've always in my life had

06:47.991 --> 06:52.121
a strong sense that I had to be free.

06:53.538 --> 06:56.633
Standing on that train, I was free.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.797
I used to love to stand in the car

07:01.922 --> 07:03.674
and listen to the rails.

07:03.882 --> 07:07.102
(MIMICS RHYTHM OF A TRAIN'S MOVEMENT)

07:10.597 --> 07:11.598
You know?

07:11.723 --> 07:13.691
It's an eccentric kind of rhythm.

07:16.645 --> 07:20.866
I arrived in New York with holes
in my socks and holes in my mind.

07:24.736 --> 07:27.159
I remember getting drunk,

07:27.280 --> 07:29.999
lying down on the sidewalk
and going to sleep.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.789
Nobody bothered me.

07:35.163 --> 07:38.007
I was always somebody who had

07:38.124 --> 07:41.469
an unquenchable curiosity about people.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.305
I liked to walk down the street
and look at faces.

07:44.464 --> 07:48.094
I used to go to the comer
of Broadway and 42nd Street

07:48.218 --> 07:50.641
in an Optimo cigar store.

07:50.804 --> 07:54.479
I would watch people for three seconds
as they went by

07:54.599 --> 07:57.694
and try to analyze their personality

07:57.811 --> 07:59.688
by just that flick.

08:01.481 --> 08:05.156
The face can hide many things.

08:05.276 --> 08:08.576
And people are always hiding things.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.250
I was interested to guess

08:12.367 --> 08:15.541
the things that people
did not know about themselves.

08:16.913 --> 08:20.759
What they feel, what they think,
why they feel.

08:20.875 --> 08:24.379
How is it that we behave the way we do?

08:25.588 --> 08:27.010
What is the answer?

08:27.132 --> 08:29.635
Is there any answer?

08:29.759 --> 08:32.683
There is something
that you need very deeply.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.852
Some kind of contact,

08:34.972 --> 08:38.273
some experience
to give you a sense of fulfillment.

08:40.602 --> 08:42.981
I had a great feeling of inadequacy,

08:43.106 --> 08:44.403
that I didn't know enough,

08:44.524 --> 08:47.027
that I didn't have enough education.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.281
I felt dumb.

09:02.584 --> 09:04.177
I became an actor

09:04.294 --> 09:06.422
pretty much by accident.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.966
I went to the New School
for Social Research,

09:09.090 --> 09:12.890
which is an extraordinary institution
of learning.

09:13.011 --> 09:15.355
My teachers were all Jewish,

09:15.472 --> 09:18.271
because the New School
was a clearing house

09:18.433 --> 09:21.937
for Jews that escaped from Hitler.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.485
They were very respected people.

09:24.689 --> 09:27.488
The cream of academia.

09:28.401 --> 09:32.201
Control over your lives

09:32.322 --> 09:34.666
begins with this class.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.205
BRANDO: I studied with a woman

09:36.326 --> 09:38.829
by the name of Stella Adler.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.626
She was a fine actress,

09:40.747 --> 09:43.296
a really wonderful actress.

09:43.458 --> 09:46.007
The smell of the greasepaint

09:46.127 --> 09:48.846
and lure of the theatrical experience

09:48.963 --> 09:51.762
came out in her teaching technique.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.760
ADLER:
The play has nothing to do with words.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.429
You do not act words,

09:55.595 --> 09:57.518
you act with your soul.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.308
BRANDO: I was very shy when I was a kid.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.936
Sensitive, very sensitive.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.153
ADLER: In the theater,

10:04.312 --> 10:05.814
the actor is the boss.

10:05.939 --> 10:10.695
It's against the nature of human life
to withdraw.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.826
BRANDO: "Don't be afraid," she said.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.075
"You have a right to be who you are,

10:16.199 --> 10:18.201
where you are and how you are."

10:18.326 --> 10:22.126
ADLER:
Be in a state of honesty up there.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.921
BRANDO:
Allowing yourself to feel things,

10:25.041 --> 10:27.294
to feel love or to feel rage.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.295
ADLER: Speak out the thoughts

10:29.420 --> 10:31.047
that are tormenting you.

10:32.090 --> 10:34.343
BRANDO: Everybody's got a story to tell,

10:34.509 --> 10:36.182
something they're hiding.

10:36.302 --> 10:39.476
ADLER: Do not bring anything
in the present

10:39.639 --> 10:42.188
that doesn't have the past.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.733
BRANDO: We develop the technique
of acting very, very early.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.652
Even from the time we're a kid,

10:47.772 --> 10:49.945
where we're throwing our oatmeal
on the floor

10:50.066 --> 10:52.410
just to get attention from our mothers.

10:52.527 --> 10:55.497
Acting is surviving.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.007
Yeah, that's my mother.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.546
That photograph there.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.130
This is a portrait of my mom

11:11.254 --> 11:13.256
when she was about forty.

11:13.381 --> 11:16.430
And she was a marvellous person.

11:16.551 --> 11:21.603
For instance, she dressed up a pet goose
we had for Santa Claus.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.107
She made a Santa Claus out of it,

11:23.224 --> 11:24.897
made a little red costume for it

11:25.018 --> 11:26.520
and a beard and everything.

11:26.728 --> 11:29.857
She was a very inventive
and artistic woman.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.904
And I miss her very much.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.239
I was given by my mother

11:37.363 --> 11:39.161
a sense of the absurd.

11:41.326 --> 11:42.794
She had false teeth.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.128
Once in a while she'd laugh.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.497
While she was laughing,

11:45.622 --> 11:48.091
her teeth would come off her gums.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.084
And the more I laughed,

11:49.209 --> 11:50.961
the more she thought it was funny

11:51.085 --> 11:53.884
and we both ended up laughing real hard.

12:00.261 --> 12:04.311
My mother taught me a love for nature,

12:04.432 --> 12:09.563
and a sense of closeness with animals.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.607
You couldn't think of a tune

12:12.774 --> 12:15.368
she couldn't play on the piano.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.862
Not one.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.536
I like remembering about her.

12:23.076 --> 12:27.172
I used to love the smell of liquor
on her breath.

12:27.288 --> 12:30.633
And her breath becomes very, very sweet.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.173
It's a lovely fragrance.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.679
My mother was an alcoholic.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.475
We lived in a small town

12:42.595 --> 12:45.018
and my mother was the town drunk.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.311
She began to dissolve

12:49.435 --> 12:51.437
and fray at the ends.

12:53.690 --> 12:56.068
When my mother was missing.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.911
Gone off someplace,
we didn't know where she was.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.662
I used to have to go
and get her out of jail.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.122
Memories even now

13:05.243 --> 13:08.543
that fill me with shame and anger.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.802
ADLER: You have to constantly act.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.592
It is not important

13:16.713 --> 13:19.307
to defend your faults in the theater.

13:19.424 --> 13:22.052
It's important to overcome them.

13:23.803 --> 13:27.899
BRANDO: Stella very kindly invited me
into her home.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.816
I then became part of her family.

13:33.521 --> 13:36.070
When I was really suffering

13:36.190 --> 13:38.989
and disjointed, disoriented with life,

13:39.152 --> 13:42.497
she was always very loving towards me.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.454
I'd never done anything in life

13:45.575 --> 13:49.205
that anybody ever said I was good at.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.582
She put her hand on my shoulders

13:51.706 --> 13:53.754
and said, "Don't worry, my boy."

13:53.916 --> 13:56.010
"I have seen you,

13:56.127 --> 13:59.131
and the world is going to hear from you."

14:09.349 --> 14:11.602
INTERVIEWER:
From the T-shirt clad Stanley Kowalski

14:11.726 --> 14:13.023
<i>in Streetcar Named Desire,</i>

14:13.144 --> 14:15.772
the role which catapulted him
to international fame,

14:15.938 --> 14:17.690
we're very pleased
to have with us this morning

14:17.857 --> 14:19.200
as our guest Mr Marlon Brando.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.789
<i>BRANDO: Streetcar Named Desire
was very satisfying to be in,</i>

14:24.989 --> 14:27.162
because I thought
it was a wonderful play.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.245
The story was superb

14:30.370 --> 14:31.792
and the production was wonderful.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.291
You must be Stanley.

14:34.415 --> 14:37.760
Oh, hiya. Where's the little woman?

14:38.378 --> 14:42.224
BRANDO: It was a very explosive part

14:42.340 --> 14:44.513
and it electrified everybody.

14:44.634 --> 14:45.806
You want a shot?

14:45.968 --> 14:48.517
BLANCHE: No, I rarely touch it.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.811
Well, some people, they rarely touch it,

14:51.015 --> 14:52.608
but it touches them often.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.232
BRANDO: I was quite nutty
when I was young

14:55.353 --> 14:57.572
and I would have a lot of energy.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.448
Rain forever.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.363
BRANDO:
'Cause you couldn't come out flat,

15:01.484 --> 15:03.031
you couldn't come out slow.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.620
After the play was over,

15:04.737 --> 15:06.614
I felt like a million bucks.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.830
I was off into the night

15:09.992 --> 15:11.665
with sparkles and zest

15:11.828 --> 15:13.751
to see whatever I could find.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.168
How wonderful it was to drive around

15:18.292 --> 15:21.011
on a motorcycle with just a T-shirt on.

15:21.129 --> 15:23.757
Two, three, four o'clock in the morning.

15:25.550 --> 15:29.271
Some small club
in the black section of town.

15:29.387 --> 15:31.264
And I was screaming

15:31.389 --> 15:33.107
when they were playing those drums.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.147
I'd hear that shit,

15:36.269 --> 15:40.399
it just used to take me to another land.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.116
This is my moment,

15:42.233 --> 15:43.655
I want to take this moment

15:43.776 --> 15:46.450
and that was wonderful.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.617
And then your life changes.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.085
Suddenly, there's a lot more girls

15:53.202 --> 15:55.045
saying, "Hi, Mar."

15:56.414 --> 15:57.540
When I was younger,

15:57.707 --> 16:00.301
I was a fairly attractive kid.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.467
I had a lot of derring-do and panache.

16:04.714 --> 16:07.263
I was unpredictable and stimulating

16:07.383 --> 16:08.680
for a lot of young girls.

16:09.886 --> 16:11.183
(MIMICS CAT'S SCREECH)

16:11.554 --> 16:17.061
BRANDO: I was young and destined
to spread my seed far and wide.

16:17.185 --> 16:19.608
Girls and fun and good food

16:19.729 --> 16:22.778
and sense of health and purpose...

16:22.899 --> 16:24.742
It can't get better than this.

16:24.901 --> 16:28.246
Nothing in life
could be better than this.

16:29.071 --> 16:32.371
I was always making jokes and teasing,

16:32.492 --> 16:35.871
playing practical jokes on everybody.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.130
(LAUGHS)

16:48.174 --> 16:50.518
To be able to have money.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.012
I never had any money.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.852
My father was a traveling salesman.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.816
I was making more in six months of work

16:59.936 --> 17:01.688
than he made in ten years.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.440
He measured everything by money.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.739
He couldn't understand
how this ne'er-do-well son of his

17:07.859 --> 17:09.532
could possibly do that.

17:13.156 --> 17:15.125
If I have a scene to play

17:15.242 --> 17:16.665
and I have to be angry,

17:16.786 --> 17:20.586
there must be within you trigger
mechanisms that are spring-loaded,

17:20.705 --> 17:24.210
that are filled with contempt
about something.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.300
I remember my father hitting my mother.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.806
I was fourteen.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.565
Now that's how
I'm gonna clear the table.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.728
Don't you ever talk that way to me.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.277
BRANDO: My old man was tough.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.820
He was a bar fighter.

17:46.941 --> 17:49.820
He was a man with not much love in him.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.489
Staying away from home,

17:52.613 --> 17:55.833
drinking and whoring
all around the Midwest.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.453
He used to slap me around,

17:58.578 --> 18:00.251
and for no good reason.

18:00.371 --> 18:03.796
And I was truly intimidated by him
at that time.

18:03.958 --> 18:06.336
Now what kind of a queen
do you think you are?

18:06.460 --> 18:08.554
You know that I've been onto you
from the start,

18:08.671 --> 18:11.800
and not once did you pull the wool
over this boy's eyes.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.677
BRANDO: When things
are extremely painful to you,

18:14.802 --> 18:16.804
you don't want them
in your consciousness,

18:16.929 --> 18:18.806
you want to forget about them.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.399
And you are the Queen of the Nile,

18:20.516 --> 18:22.610
sitting on your throne,
swilling down my liquor.

18:22.727 --> 18:25.697
You know what I say? Ha-ha!

18:25.855 --> 18:29.405
BRANDO: You can imagine
having to go someplace every night

18:29.525 --> 18:30.822
and go through all that,

18:30.985 --> 18:32.453
get yourself upset...

18:32.570 --> 18:34.789
To have to cry or to scream

18:34.905 --> 18:38.705
or to be ruined in some way,
that's work.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.124
That's hard work.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.998
People invariably associated me
with the part I played,

18:44.165 --> 18:47.635
so that it was difficult to believe
that I didn't eat off the floor,

18:47.752 --> 18:52.474
or that I, you know, didn't run up
the street with my shoes off,

18:52.590 --> 18:56.015
and so it's been a hard thing
sort of living that down.

18:56.844 --> 19:00.439
There is nothing about me
that is like Stanley Kowalski.

19:00.556 --> 19:01.933
I hate that kinda guy.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.810
I absolutely hate that person

19:03.934 --> 19:06.232
and I couldn't identify with it.

19:06.771 --> 19:12.244
The brute, dark character that
represented the beasts and the animals.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.997
They sent me to a psychiatrist.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.866
They thought I was going nuts,

19:19.033 --> 19:21.286
losing my mind.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.538
Stella told me,
if you come to the theater

19:23.663 --> 19:26.792
and you feel a hundred percent,
show eighty.

19:26.916 --> 19:30.716
If you come and you feel sixty percent,
show forty.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.176
If you come to the theater

19:33.297 --> 19:35.470
and you only feel forty percent,

19:35.591 --> 19:37.844
best to turn around and go home.

19:37.968 --> 19:40.187
INTERVIEWER:
I was wondering if you have any plans

19:40.304 --> 19:42.602
to return to the stage
in the near future.

19:42.723 --> 19:48.571
BRANDO: No, I don't have any immediate
intentions of returning to the stage.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.906
(TAPE RECORDER CLICKS)

19:59.031 --> 20:00.999
BRANDO: The shouts of freedom

20:01.117 --> 20:03.586
are also the rattling of chains.

20:05.621 --> 20:09.467
BRANDO:
You seem to be such a restless man.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.881
Eyes always darting.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.219
BRANDO: I don't know,

20:13.337 --> 20:16.136
I guess I've just got loose feet.

20:16.757 --> 20:22.514
INTERVIEWER: I infer from that that you
do not thoroughly enjoy your profession.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.478
Or you don't enjoy it at all.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.942
BRANDO: No, I think that people
do what they enjoy,

20:27.059 --> 20:28.276
or else they don't do it.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.362
People do what they want to do.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.404
If there are adverse conditions
that surround my work,

20:34.525 --> 20:36.152
they are not adverse enough

20:36.318 --> 20:38.912
to make me change activities.

20:41.824 --> 20:44.748
If I hadn't had the good luck
to be an actor,

20:44.869 --> 20:47.839
I don't know what I would've been.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.878
I'd have probably been a con man.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.593
A good con man.

20:52.710 --> 20:57.181
Tell smooth lies, give impressions
of things that he thinks,

20:57.339 --> 21:00.434
or appears to think
that he doesn't think.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.978
Since I don't do anything else well,

21:03.095 --> 21:05.473
and up to this time I haven't decided

21:05.598 --> 21:06.941
what else I would like to do,

21:07.057 --> 21:08.855
I might as well put all my energies

21:08.976 --> 21:11.399
into being as good an actor as I can.

21:14.064 --> 21:15.782
WOMAN:
Now will you turn your head for us?

21:15.900 --> 21:17.117
Sure.

21:18.486 --> 21:20.204
WOMAN: Now around the other way.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.826
Now all the way around.

21:29.497 --> 21:34.173
All right. Thank you and stay around.

21:36.212 --> 21:37.680
BRANDO: Shakespeare said,

21:37.797 --> 21:39.470
"There is no art to find

21:39.590 --> 21:41.718
the mind's construction in the face."

21:41.842 --> 21:44.436
And there should be such an art.

21:46.055 --> 21:48.854
When the camera is close on you,

21:48.974 --> 21:51.773
your face becomes the stage.

21:51.894 --> 21:54.522
Your face is the proscenium arch

21:54.647 --> 21:56.900
of the theater, thirty feet high.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.945
And it sees all the little movements

22:00.069 --> 22:03.494
of the face and the eye and the mouth.

22:03.614 --> 22:06.208
You have the intensity to act.

22:09.203 --> 22:10.329
I wanted very much

22:10.454 --> 22:13.378
to be involved in motion pictures,

22:13.499 --> 22:15.046
so I could change it

22:15.209 --> 22:17.462
into something nearer the truth.

22:17.586 --> 22:20.214
And I was convinced
that I could do that.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.809
About my playing the tuba...

22:23.926 --> 22:26.270
Seems like a lot of fuss
has been made about that.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.101
BRANDO: In the '30s and '40s

22:28.222 --> 22:30.645
you had a particular kind of acting.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.064
You knew who you were gonna get

22:33.185 --> 22:35.028
when you went to the movies.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.986
Gary Cooper oats.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.821
Shredded Wheat Bogart.

22:39.942 --> 22:43.412
Clark Gable Crunchy Fruit Loops.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.281
They were just like breakfast cereals.

22:45.489 --> 22:47.412
The same in every role.

22:49.118 --> 22:52.122
Gestures of anguish and despair,

22:52.246 --> 22:55.216
and that kind of acting became absurd.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.383
The astounding thing

23:00.504 --> 23:01.926
most people don't realize.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.683
All motion pictures today,

23:04.800 --> 23:06.268
all acting today,

23:06.427 --> 23:08.521
stems from Stella Adler.

23:09.430 --> 23:12.149
INTERVIEWER: Stella, so much
has been talked about Method acting.

23:12.266 --> 23:14.109
What exactly is the Method?

23:14.226 --> 23:17.821
All right, let's start at the beginning.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.282
BRANDO: Stella went to Paris

23:20.441 --> 23:23.786
and studied
with Konstantin Stanislavsky,

23:23.903 --> 23:25.325
the great Russian teacher,

23:25.487 --> 23:28.240
brought back
her experience and knowledge

23:28.407 --> 23:30.455
of this particular form of acting.

23:30.576 --> 23:35.332
Reality, realness, carried by an actor

23:35.539 --> 23:37.337
to achieve the truth.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.968
This is the most modern technique.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.422
BRANDO: Everything that you do,

23:42.546 --> 23:43.798
make it real as you can.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.176
Make it alive, make it tangible,

23:46.300 --> 23:48.678
find the truth of that moment.

23:48.802 --> 23:51.180
Mr Stanislavsky understood that.

23:51.764 --> 23:55.314
BRANDO: And the style of acting
changed completely.

23:56.727 --> 23:59.526
The first movie I ever did
was called The Men.

23:59.647 --> 24:01.365
<i>L played a paraplegic</i>

24:01.565 --> 24:04.944
and lived in a hospital
with paraplegics for three weeks.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.744
Physicality is a tough thing.

24:08.906 --> 24:12.831
I spent a lot of time just studying
everything they do.

24:12.952 --> 24:16.001
I wanted to see how
they got in and out of their chairs.

24:16.163 --> 24:19.167
The manner in which you crawled
from one place to another.

24:20.584 --> 24:23.838
Paraplegics,
they do the most amazing things.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.216
Races without their chairs,

24:26.340 --> 24:28.092
I've seen guys walk on their hands.

24:28.217 --> 24:29.639
They can do one-armed pull-ups,

24:29.802 --> 24:31.054
they can do everything.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.851
You have to know your subject,

24:32.972 --> 24:34.599
you have to know your character.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.772
Putting yourself
in a different state of mind.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.857
What they felt like,

24:39.979 --> 24:41.401
what their frustrations were

24:41.563 --> 24:43.816
knowing that they couldn't have sex.

24:43.941 --> 24:46.410
BRANDO AS KEN:
What am I gonna do, where am I gonna go?

24:47.486 --> 24:49.534
I can't go out there anymore.

24:50.114 --> 24:54.039
BRANDO: He just sits there
and he marinates his mind.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.958
In the intellect; that's all he's got.

24:57.079 --> 24:58.376
Put your heart into it.

24:58.539 --> 25:00.712
Get yourself up emotionally.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.715
At night I think about it,

25:03.836 --> 25:05.053
dream about it

25:05.212 --> 25:07.840
and I wake up being absorbed by it.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.683
People have routines:

25:09.800 --> 25:12.679
acting routines, dancing routines,
painting routines.

25:12.803 --> 25:15.147
The same thing over and over again.

25:15.264 --> 25:17.687
Everything is a cliché.

25:18.225 --> 25:21.855
When an actor takes a little too long
as he's walking to the door,

25:21.979 --> 25:24.152
you know he's going to stop
and turn around and say...

25:24.273 --> 25:27.152
"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."

25:27.276 --> 25:29.449
BRANDO:
Jersey Joe Walcott, terrific fighter.

25:29.611 --> 25:33.206
He'd be boxing, he'd be throwing
some punches and bing!

25:33.365 --> 25:35.413
He'd have his fist in somebody's face.

25:35.576 --> 25:37.453
You'd think it was coming out
of the southwest

25:37.619 --> 25:39.462
and there it comes out of the northeast.

25:39.663 --> 25:42.542
He would never let you know
where he was going to hit you.

25:42.708 --> 25:43.960
You.

25:44.084 --> 25:47.930
BRANDO: Never let the audience know
how it's gonna come out.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.048
What is your name?

25:49.173 --> 25:51.096
BRANDO: Get them on your time.

25:51.216 --> 25:55.437
Emiliano Zapata.

25:59.016 --> 26:01.360
BRANDO: And when that time comes
and everything is right,

26:01.560 --> 26:03.904
you just fuck, let fly.

26:04.021 --> 26:07.321
O judgment, thou art fled
to brutish beasts,

26:07.441 --> 26:09.239
and men have lost their reason.

26:09.359 --> 26:10.906
BRANDO: Hit them, knock them over.

26:11.028 --> 26:13.156
With an attitude,

26:13.280 --> 26:14.953
with a word, with a look.

26:15.699 --> 26:17.326
I don't like cops.

26:17.451 --> 26:18.668
BRANDO: Be surprising.

26:18.786 --> 26:21.335
Figure out a way to do it

26:21.455 --> 26:22.957
that has never been done before.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.629
You gotta put something down,

26:24.750 --> 26:25.797
you gotta make some jive.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.716
Don't you know what I'm talking about?

26:27.836 --> 26:31.807
BRANDO: You want to stop that movement
from the popcorn to the mouth.

26:31.924 --> 26:37.681
Cry "Havoc,"
and let slip the dogs of war.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.603
BRANDO: Get people to stop chewing.

26:39.723 --> 26:44.479
That this foul deed
shall smell above the earth.

26:44.645 --> 26:46.693
BRANDO: The truth will do that.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.697
Damn, damn, damn, damn.

26:50.818 --> 26:52.411
When it's right, it's right.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.113
You can feel it in your bones.

26:55.447 --> 26:56.915
Then you feel whole,

26:57.032 --> 26:58.500
then you feel good.

27:01.870 --> 27:03.417
It was pre-sixties.

27:03.539 --> 27:05.667
People were looking for rebellion,

27:05.791 --> 27:08.715
and I happened to be at the fight place
at the right time

27:08.836 --> 27:10.713
with the right state of mind.

27:11.922 --> 27:14.892
In a sense, it was my own story.

27:15.008 --> 27:17.477
Rebelling for the sake of rebelling.

27:35.863 --> 27:37.786
WOMAN: Hello, Mr Brando.

27:37.906 --> 27:40.876
I hope you don't think
I'm too crazy for making this recording.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.586
I wrote you a fan letter once,

27:42.744 --> 27:44.462
but I don't know if you received it.

27:45.956 --> 27:49.551
Once I saw a picture of you
with a white cat. Was it yours?

27:49.710 --> 27:53.556
I'll bet you're one of the kindest,
most interesting fellows in Hollywood.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.808
I suppose I'm judging the book
by the cover,

27:55.924 --> 27:58.723
but perhaps I'm not too far wrong.

27:58.844 --> 28:01.723
Mr Brando?
I hope this isn't too personal,

28:01.847 --> 28:05.067
but I always say what I think,
so I won't stop now.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.528
I admire you very much,

28:07.728 --> 28:09.571
both as an actor and a person.

28:09.771 --> 28:12.274
Many, many other people
feel the same way.

28:12.399 --> 28:14.493
I think one of the main reasons
that I admire you

28:14.610 --> 28:16.612
is because you aren't afraid
to be yourself,

28:16.778 --> 28:19.452
instead of being a carbon copy
of everyone else.

28:19.573 --> 28:20.950
It would be a pretty dull world

28:21.074 --> 28:22.826
if everyone behaved in the same way,

28:22.951 --> 28:25.795
so three cheers for you, Mr Brando.

28:30.584 --> 28:34.839
BRANDO: I didn't intend to have
that extraordinary effect.

28:34.963 --> 28:39.764
I became, very quickly, a cult hero.

28:51.271 --> 28:55.321
And now I know that you're as anxious
as I am to find out what actor

28:55.442 --> 28:59.663
has won the Oscar
for the best perfonnance of this year.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.740
The winner is

29:01.907 --> 29:04.626
<i>Marlon Brando for On the Waterfront.</i>

29:08.372 --> 29:09.589
REPORTER: Marlon Brando,

29:09.748 --> 29:11.921
an actor of very considerable talent.

29:12.042 --> 29:15.012
The youngest actor
ever honoured in this way.

29:18.006 --> 29:20.134
BRANDO: When I saw the picture finally,

29:20.259 --> 29:21.932
I was so embarrassed,

29:22.052 --> 29:24.430
so disappointed in my performance.

29:25.305 --> 29:28.855
It's much heavier than I imagined.

29:29.851 --> 29:32.821
It's like carrying a monkey around
on your back.

29:32.938 --> 29:36.192
They're asking me to put the finger
on my own brother.

29:37.359 --> 29:41.330
BRANDO: It's a very strange thing
this business of storytelling.

29:41.488 --> 29:43.536
You don't always know when you're good.

29:44.366 --> 29:46.664
You wanna hear my philosophy of life?

29:49.705 --> 29:52.208
Do it to him before he does it to you.

29:52.332 --> 29:54.585
BRANDO: People will mythologize you

29:54.710 --> 29:56.508
no matter what you do.

29:58.171 --> 30:00.173
There's something absurd about it,

30:00.299 --> 30:02.427
that people go with hard-earned cash

30:02.551 --> 30:05.179
into a darkened room

30:05.637 --> 30:08.686
where they sit
and they look at a crystalline screen

30:08.849 --> 30:12.649
upon which images move around
and speak.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.982
And the reason they don't have light
in the theater

30:17.107 --> 30:20.111
is because you are there
with your fantasy.

30:21.403 --> 30:23.201
The person up on the screen

30:23.322 --> 30:26.371
is doing all the things
that you want to do,

30:26.491 --> 30:28.493
they're kissing the woman
you want to kiss,

30:28.618 --> 30:30.336
hitting the people you want to hit,

30:30.495 --> 30:33.499
being brave in a way
that you want to be brave.

30:34.333 --> 30:38.304
The audience will lend themselves
to the subject.

30:39.421 --> 30:42.595
They will create things
that are not there.

30:42.716 --> 30:44.639
Listen to me, Terry, take the job.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.728
Just take it. No questions, take it.

30:46.887 --> 30:50.061
BRANDO: There are times I know
I did much better acting

30:50.182 --> 30:52.230
<i>than in that scene
from On the Waterfront.</i>

30:52.351 --> 30:53.728
You don't understand.

30:53.894 --> 30:55.737
I coulda had class.

30:55.896 --> 30:57.694
I coulda been a contender.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.984
I coulda been somebody.

31:00.734 --> 31:02.702
Instead of a bum.

31:02.903 --> 31:05.076
Which is what I am, let's face it.

31:05.197 --> 31:08.371
BRANDO: It had nothing to do with me.

31:08.492 --> 31:10.244
The audience does the work,

31:10.369 --> 31:12.463
they are doing the acting.

31:12.579 --> 31:15.207
Everybody feels like they're a failure,

31:15.374 --> 31:18.799
everybody feels
they could've been a contender.

31:18.919 --> 31:20.671
Inferiority.

31:21.254 --> 31:23.882
I've been very close to it all my life.

31:28.470 --> 31:30.689
ED MURROW: Marlon,
I know your dad is in town tonight.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.649
Is he hiding out somewhere?

31:32.766 --> 31:34.768
BRANDO: No, I'll get him in here. Pop?

31:34.935 --> 31:36.278
Come on out.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.773
ED MURROW: We'll ask Mr Brando
some questions about his son

31:38.939 --> 31:41.658
and I'm sure we'll get
the blunt and direct answers.

31:41.775 --> 31:43.027
Good evening, Mr Brando.

31:43.151 --> 31:46.621
I imagine you're just a bit proud
of your son right now, aren't you?

31:49.324 --> 31:52.168
Well, as an actor not too proud,

31:52.285 --> 31:55.255
but as a man, why, quite proud.

31:55.372 --> 31:56.840
ED MURROW: Mr Brando, tell me this.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.418
Was he hard to handle as a child?

31:59.543 --> 32:01.796
FATHER: I think he had the usual...

32:03.839 --> 32:05.341
childhood traits.

32:05.465 --> 32:07.809
I think he had probably a little more

32:07.926 --> 32:11.772
trouble with his parents
than most children do.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.399
ED MURROW: Marlon, in the interests
of justice and fairness,

32:14.516 --> 32:17.440
would you like 30 seconds
to defend yourself?

32:17.561 --> 32:19.563
Well, I don't feel
I need to defend myself.

32:19.688 --> 32:22.362
I can lick this guy with one hand, so...

32:23.775 --> 32:25.072
Let it go.

32:26.236 --> 32:30.116
BRANDO: We had an act
we put on for each other.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.083
I played the loving son

32:32.200 --> 32:35.830
and they played the adoring parents.

32:35.996 --> 32:38.795
There was a lot of hypocrisy.

32:38.957 --> 32:44.259
When what you are as a child
is unwanted, it's unwelcome,

32:44.379 --> 32:48.555
then you look for an identity
that will be acceptable.

32:48.675 --> 32:53.146
So I had a wide variety
of perfonnances in me.

32:55.056 --> 32:56.774
ED SULLIVAN: I'm very anxious for you.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.940
I know you haven't seen
all of the footage,

32:59.060 --> 33:01.233
but your light comedy performance

33:01.354 --> 33:04.278
<i>in Guys and Dolls
is really terrific, Marlon.</i>

33:04.399 --> 33:05.446
Well, I hope so.

33:05.567 --> 33:07.240
I'm very anxious to see it.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.237
In fact, I'm dying to see it.

33:10.113 --> 33:11.660
How was Vegas?

33:11.781 --> 33:14.375
Paradise. For two weeks I gambled
in green pastures,

33:14.493 --> 33:15.585
the dice were my cousins

33:15.702 --> 33:18.831
and the dolls were agreeable
with nice teeth and no last names.

33:19.748 --> 33:21.421
You don't believe I'm a sinner, do you?

33:21.541 --> 33:24.670
I'm prepared to believe that you are the
biggest sinner I ever met in my life.

33:25.879 --> 33:29.304
BRANDO: It's part of an actor's trade
to be able to play in a light vein

33:29.424 --> 33:33.554
and be an entertainer
as well as a serious storyteller.

33:33.678 --> 33:38.730
And I feel that I perhaps have neglected
that part of my career up to this point.

33:40.644 --> 33:43.864
When I go to set I have a lot of fun,
because it's a gay affair.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.524
It's pleasant to look forward to,

33:45.649 --> 33:47.151
it's a nice way to spend your day,

33:47.275 --> 33:51.075
rather than be in the middle of a miasma
of seriousness and gravity.

33:52.614 --> 33:55.914
As a kid, when I used to sell bottles
and cut lawns

33:56.076 --> 33:59.626
to get my ten cents to go to the movie,

33:59.746 --> 34:01.874
and I would escape everything.

34:07.587 --> 34:09.885
That sense of good feeling,

34:10.549 --> 34:12.222
that got me through the week.

34:13.467 --> 34:16.347
Those moments were magical.

34:22.185 --> 34:25.188
REPORTER: The glittering world premiere
at New York's Capitol Theater

34:25.313 --> 34:30.194
for Samuel Goldwyn's multi-million
dollar production of Guys and Dolls.

34:30.360 --> 34:34.786
# Your eyes are the eyes

34:34.906 --> 34:38.581
<i>it of a woman in love</i>

34:38.702 --> 34:45.255
<i>it And oh, how they give you away</i>

34:46.458 --> 34:49.632
<i>it Why try to deny...</i>

34:49.754 --> 34:53.475
BRANDO: Most actors
want to get their name in the paper.

34:53.592 --> 34:56.562
They like all that attention.

34:57.512 --> 35:01.437
<i>I very often am struck
with the illusion of success.</i>

35:02.267 --> 35:04.486
Sometimes it's difficult
when you meet people

35:04.603 --> 35:07.277
because you see
that they have prejudged you,

35:07.397 --> 35:09.695
not to be treated normally.

35:09.816 --> 35:13.741
To have people staring at you
like an animal in a zoo,

35:13.862 --> 35:17.036
or some strange creature
from a distant land.

35:18.199 --> 35:20.827
What it does is remove you from reality.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.499
(FANS SCREAM)

35:26.875 --> 35:29.970
I can't stand it. I hate it.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.756
I had no idea of how discomforting it is

35:32.922 --> 35:36.017
not to be able to be
just an ordinary person.

35:36.176 --> 35:38.520
You can't imagine
how much of a panic it is.

35:38.637 --> 35:39.889
Really, it scared me to death,

35:40.013 --> 35:41.390
because they were hanging on,

35:41.514 --> 35:44.233
they could've been run over or crushed.
It really is...

35:44.392 --> 35:46.861
I've never seen
a really hysterical crowd.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.355
It's a frightening experience.

35:55.779 --> 35:58.077
BRANDO: Relax, Marlon.

35:58.239 --> 35:59.866
And breathe deeply now.

36:04.287 --> 36:07.507
You don't need to feel frightened,

36:07.624 --> 36:09.843
you don't need to be nervous.

36:18.176 --> 36:21.521
You're very, very comfortable.

36:21.638 --> 36:26.360
Deeply safe,
like when you were with Ermi,

36:26.476 --> 36:29.480
when you slept in her arms,

36:29.604 --> 36:31.572
when you received affection.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.863
Remember those feelings.

36:37.946 --> 36:41.120
She was a governess
hired by my mother.

36:42.117 --> 36:45.337
Lovely Oriental skin.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.672
She had very fine hair.

36:48.790 --> 36:50.588
She was sleeping,

36:50.709 --> 36:53.633
and through the windows
came the moonlight,

36:53.753 --> 36:56.677
and illuminated her body.

36:57.799 --> 37:02.726
I remember arranging myself
on her, over her,

37:02.846 --> 37:06.316
and thinking that she was all mine,

37:06.433 --> 37:08.561
that she belonged to me alone.

37:11.396 --> 37:16.448
Everybody wants a guarantee
that their love is going to be returned.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.536
"I'm going to love you till I die

37:18.653 --> 37:21.497
and we're going to love each other
forever."

37:21.614 --> 37:26.836
All of those adolescent and childish
concepts of what love ought to be.

37:29.330 --> 37:32.550
I remember the night she left.

37:32.667 --> 37:33.964
She went away to get married,

37:34.085 --> 37:36.258
but to a seven-year-old mind,

37:36.379 --> 37:38.256
having been with someone intimately,

37:38.381 --> 37:41.931
it was tantamount to desertion.

37:42.469 --> 37:45.097
In a sense, my mother left me,

37:45.305 --> 37:47.478
because she was alcoholic.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.272
And so did Ermi.

37:51.644 --> 37:56.775
It was from that date that I became
a miscreant, badly behaved.

38:02.447 --> 38:04.120
- CAMERAMAN: Okay.
- Okay.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.159
I'd like to begin by asking you

38:06.326 --> 38:10.126
what consumes your thoughts
in your spare time, when you have any?

38:10.330 --> 38:12.082
Well, my thoughts are...

38:12.207 --> 38:13.959
INTERVIEWER: What do you do?

38:14.083 --> 38:17.087
I'm interested in your face.

38:17.212 --> 38:19.965
You're one of the prettiest
interviewers that I've...

38:20.089 --> 38:21.181
INTERVIEWER: Thank you.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.393
You're one of the most gracious hosts
I've ever met.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.387
- Oh really?
- INTERVIEWER: Yes.

38:25.512 --> 38:27.560
I hope to see you in Chicago.

38:27.680 --> 38:28.806
(LAUGHTER)

38:28.932 --> 38:31.230
- We'd like to see you in Chicago.
- We?

38:31.392 --> 38:33.440
Is that the collective "we"
or is that the...

38:33.561 --> 38:36.030
There are many people
who would like to see you in Chicago.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.616
- But you don't?
- Certainly, I do.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.954
Well, I'm representing WNAC in Boston

38:43.071 --> 38:45.745
and our viewing audience
would love to know why you're here

38:45.865 --> 38:48.038
and for you to tell us
about your latest movie.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.412
Excuse me,
I didn't mean to touch your ankle.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.051
Well, what can I tell you about it?

38:56.209 --> 38:58.132
INTERVIEWER:
Oh, just some interesting things

38:58.336 --> 38:59.883
that our audience would like to hear...

39:00.004 --> 39:03.599
You talk out of the side of your mouth,
did you ever notice that?

39:03.716 --> 39:06.185
- INTERVIEWER: No, I...
- You talk... It's channing.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.561
NTERVIEWER: Unintentional.

39:07.720 --> 39:11.645
It's a physical idiosyncrasy,
but it's a charming one.

39:12.433 --> 39:14.856
We can't see your right eye.

39:14.978 --> 39:17.527
Talking from the side of my mouth?

39:17.647 --> 39:18.944
Wouldn't want to do that.

39:19.107 --> 39:24.785
Would you like to tell us about behind
the scenes while making the picture?

39:24.904 --> 39:26.577
How far behind the scenes?

39:26.698 --> 39:28.245
(LAUGHTER)

39:32.537 --> 39:34.084
BRANDO: Answer me something, is it true?

39:34.205 --> 39:38.005
There are some rumors about you
and Marlon Brando having a romance, huh?

39:38.126 --> 39:39.878
WOMAN: Oh no, we're just good friends.

39:40.044 --> 39:41.296
BRANDO: Just good friends?

39:41.462 --> 39:44.306
Well, it seems the other night,
you were going into Mr Brando's room

39:44.465 --> 39:47.719
and not coming out until early morning.
Is that true?

39:48.636 --> 39:50.604
WOMAN: Well, yes, it's true,

39:50.722 --> 39:52.599
but he is a perfect gentleman.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.022
BRANDO: He's a perfect gentleman. I see.

39:55.143 --> 39:58.022
Is it true there was some love making
going on there?

39:58.146 --> 40:01.821
The people in the next room seem to
have heard some thumping about and...

40:01.941 --> 40:05.787
and some rattling of the bed itself.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.451
WOMAN: Well, I slept with him.

40:07.572 --> 40:10.200
BRANDO: You slept with him?
Well, I don't...

40:10.325 --> 40:11.542
WOMAN: In the same bed.

40:11.659 --> 40:15.163
BRANDO: Well, I don't know if we can
talk about this over the air, I mean...

40:15.288 --> 40:17.632
I hope you folks listening in
will not be...

40:17.749 --> 40:20.047
WOMAN: Just close your ears.

40:22.253 --> 40:25.473
WOMAN 2:
You have what most men want.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.809
You have a lady to fuck,

40:27.926 --> 40:31.681
you have a woman who loves you,
you have a...

40:31.804 --> 40:34.432
(BRANDO LAUGHS)

40:39.979 --> 40:41.526
WOMAN 2: Guilty, aren't you?

40:43.316 --> 40:45.489
BRANDO: I'm not guilty.

40:46.653 --> 40:49.953
It's just the... It's the tequila.

40:50.073 --> 40:52.167
- WOMAN 2: It's the what?
- BRANDO: It's the tequila.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.535
WOMAN 2: I got it.

40:55.370 --> 40:59.045
BRANDO: Past a certain point,
the penis has its own agenda.

40:59.207 --> 41:01.630
It has nothing to do with you

41:01.751 --> 41:05.847
and a lot of your decisions are made
by your penis and not by your brain.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.842
REPORTER:
I'd like to show you a wedding picture.

41:09.968 --> 41:13.063
A wedding that took place
on October 11th, 1957.

41:13.179 --> 41:14.681
The man is Marlon Brando.

41:14.806 --> 41:19.152
The woman? A young Indian actress
and a model, Anna Kashfi.

41:20.979 --> 41:23.277
BRANDO: A good con man can fool anybody.

41:23.398 --> 41:26.368
And the first person that you fool

41:26.526 --> 41:28.324
as a con man is yourself.

41:29.570 --> 41:31.914
She found out about other women
in my life

41:32.031 --> 41:37.083
and I had women coming in the door,
going out the window...

41:37.203 --> 41:40.958
The beast aspect of my personality
held sway

41:41.082 --> 41:46.805
and overtook anything that was
reasonable, rational, moral or decent.

41:47.880 --> 41:51.350
Because if you haven't ever been loved,
or ever known love,

41:51.509 --> 41:53.227
you'll never know where it is.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.597
You don't know what it looks like
or sounds like.

41:55.722 --> 41:58.316
You look in the most unlikely places
to find it.

41:59.851 --> 42:02.149
REPORTER:
Marriage lasted but a few months,

42:02.270 --> 42:04.443
but a child was born out that coupling.

42:04.605 --> 42:06.152
Christian Devi.

42:07.650 --> 42:10.244
BRANDO:
I can remember the baby breathing...

42:10.361 --> 42:12.363
(BREATHES GENTLY)

42:12.530 --> 42:14.828
Little tiny baby like that...

42:14.949 --> 42:16.951
Then listening to the heart.

42:19.245 --> 42:22.875
I didn't want my father
to get near Christian.

42:24.208 --> 42:28.759
The day he was born, I said it to myself
with tears in my eyes in the hospital,

42:28.921 --> 42:31.640
"My father is never going
to come near that child,

42:31.758 --> 42:34.602
because of the damage he did to me."

42:41.059 --> 42:44.063
INTERVIEWER:
Can I move on to your own acting career

42:44.187 --> 42:46.565
and how your moral beliefs
have affected it?

42:46.731 --> 42:50.577
<i>For example, we associate you
with roles like On the Waterfront,</i>

42:50.693 --> 42:54.072
where you are a man
who is fighting a righteous cause,

42:54.197 --> 42:55.289
a sort of underdog,

42:55.406 --> 42:57.500
you've got the whole union machine
against you,

42:57.658 --> 43:00.411
<i>and then there's the roles
like the rebel leader in Viva Zapata!</i>

43:00.578 --> 43:02.080
Where you are for the poor.

43:02.246 --> 43:03.964
Do you deliberately choose these roles?

43:04.082 --> 43:08.258
Over your career you've deliberately
chosen roles that have

43:08.377 --> 43:10.505
gone along with your political beliefs?

43:10.713 --> 43:12.260
Yes, I think so.

43:18.012 --> 43:20.982
NARRATOR: On December 23rd, 1787,

43:21.099 --> 43:23.522
His Majesty's ship, Bounty,
sailed from England

43:23.643 --> 43:25.361
bound for the South Seas,

43:25.478 --> 43:27.901
culminating in the most famous mutiny
in history.

43:28.022 --> 43:29.990
CAPTAIN BLIGH:
You can put it in one word. Fear.

43:30.108 --> 43:31.985
Fear of punishment so vivid in his mind

43:32.110 --> 43:33.908
that he fears it even more
than certain death.

43:34.028 --> 43:36.201
In my years of service,
I have never met an officer

43:36.322 --> 43:39.872
who inflicted punishment upon men
with such incredible relish.

43:41.369 --> 43:42.541
It's sickening.

43:43.538 --> 43:47.418
Then go and be sick in your cabin,
Mr Christian.

43:47.542 --> 43:48.964
BRANDO: Human hatred.

43:49.085 --> 43:50.337
What is the answer?

43:50.461 --> 43:53.055
Is there any answer to injustice?

43:53.172 --> 43:56.722
I wanted to make pictures
that are meaningful to me.

43:56.843 --> 43:59.062
CAPTAIN BLIGH:
You'd best join my war, Mr Christian,

43:59.178 --> 44:00.771
for if I don't start winning soon,

44:00.888 --> 44:02.890
the casualty list will be real enough.

44:04.183 --> 44:07.562
BRANDO: You bring part of yourself
to every character,

44:07.728 --> 44:11.403
but some parts
are closer to us than others.

44:15.820 --> 44:18.994
Is the story true about
you going to school in Minneapolis?

44:19.115 --> 44:22.335
I went to a military academy called...

44:24.036 --> 44:26.130
Well, I won't tell you the name.

44:26.247 --> 44:27.499
I had a terrible time there.

44:29.792 --> 44:33.342
BRANDO: My father sent me
to military school, away from home,

44:33.462 --> 44:36.557
the one he had attended.

44:36.674 --> 44:39.894
It was a cruel and unusual punishment.

44:42.138 --> 44:45.187
The mind of the military has one aim:

44:45.766 --> 44:48.895
to be as mechanical as possible.

44:49.979 --> 44:52.732
To function like a human machine.

44:54.775 --> 44:57.904
Individuality simply did not exist.

44:59.989 --> 45:02.208
I had a lot of loneliness.

45:04.035 --> 45:07.756
I spent most of the time
up in the library

45:07.872 --> 45:12.628
reading the National Geographic
magazine about Tahiti.

45:13.753 --> 45:17.599
I was entranced
by the expressions on their faces.

45:17.757 --> 45:20.180
They had unmanaged faces,

45:20.301 --> 45:22.554
no manicured expressions.

45:22.720 --> 45:23.937
A kindness.

45:26.098 --> 45:27.520
That's where I want to go,

45:27.642 --> 45:29.235
that's where I want to be.

45:38.611 --> 45:41.455
<i>When I made Mutiny on the Bounty,</i>

45:41.572 --> 45:44.826
finally I got a chance to go to Tahiti.

45:56.420 --> 45:58.093
I'd fallen in love with Tahiti.

45:58.214 --> 46:00.091
It was everything I longed for,

46:00.216 --> 46:02.344
everything I hoped it would be.

46:06.013 --> 46:08.482
As soon as they'd say cut,

46:08.599 --> 46:11.148
I'd take off my jacket,
dive into the water

46:11.269 --> 46:14.899
and swim under the boats
and play on the beach.

46:17.483 --> 46:20.953
The sky... I've never see a sky like it.

46:21.070 --> 46:24.870
And the sunsets defy words.

46:24.991 --> 46:27.119
My God.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.088
I've only been here a short time.

46:31.205 --> 46:33.583
I have been puzzled
every time I see Tahitians,

46:33.708 --> 46:36.632
because I can't figure out
what they're thinking.

46:36.794 --> 46:40.173
When you watch Tahitians,
it's like watching a wave,

46:40.298 --> 46:43.598
or the wind in the palm tree,
or the palm tree itself.

46:44.802 --> 46:47.146
They'll bring their drums
and their skirts,

46:47.263 --> 46:48.480
and they'll laugh and dance

46:48.639 --> 46:50.562
and drink and make love.

46:50.725 --> 46:52.443
Full of laughter.

46:56.063 --> 46:57.315
CAPTAIN BLIGH: Mr Christian.

46:59.650 --> 47:01.744
Kindly satisfy your lust elsewhere.

47:03.070 --> 47:05.664
Quite actually, sir,
we were simply discussing...

47:05.823 --> 47:06.915
Acknowledge the order.

47:09.076 --> 47:11.704
Lust to be satisfied elsewhere, sir.

47:11.871 --> 47:13.418
Report on board immediately.

47:17.251 --> 47:19.504
You bloody fool.

47:21.881 --> 47:25.135
<i>BRANDO: Mutiny on the Bounty
was perhaps my very worst experience</i>

47:25.259 --> 47:27.227
in making a motion picture.

47:27.345 --> 47:31.191
I never want to do that kind of picture
again as long as I live.

47:32.975 --> 47:35.148
Nobody was agreed when we went in.

47:35.269 --> 47:38.614
We all knew that it was impossible
to shoot that story.

47:38.731 --> 47:41.530
It won't work. That will never work.

47:41.650 --> 47:45.621
You can't have Christian standing aside
not doing anything.

47:45.738 --> 47:48.457
Keep him alive in the story.

47:49.617 --> 47:55.044
<i>I was never consulted
before the writing was done.</i>

47:55.164 --> 47:58.043
And I cared a great deal
about this picture.

47:59.919 --> 48:02.593
You put your life in the hands
of the director,

48:02.713 --> 48:04.590
because the director can screw you up.

48:04.757 --> 48:07.226
You're going too lightly, Quintal.

48:07.343 --> 48:09.562
Lay on with a will
or you'll take his place.

48:10.721 --> 48:12.598
BRANDO: They can't direct actors,

48:12.723 --> 48:15.476
they don't know what the process is.

48:15.601 --> 48:21.199
How delicate it is
to create an emotional impression.

48:21.315 --> 48:25.991
They cover up their sense of inadequacy
by being very authoritative,

48:26.112 --> 48:28.365
commanding things.

48:28.489 --> 48:31.959
INTERVIEWER: Didn't he say he wanted
to talk to you and explain it to you?

48:32.076 --> 48:36.172
BRANDO: He wanted to give me
a long "no", and I favor short "noes".

48:36.288 --> 48:37.335
INTERVIEWER: No, I did...

48:37.456 --> 48:40.960
BRANDO: You can't argue with somebody
who's made up their mind.

48:41.836 --> 48:44.555
Don't ever be intimidated by directors.

48:47.758 --> 48:50.682
You bloody bastard.

48:50.803 --> 48:52.976
You'll not put your foot on me again.

48:53.097 --> 48:56.522
There was a great deal of friction,
confusion and desperation,

48:56.642 --> 48:58.440
disappointment and disgust,

48:58.561 --> 48:59.858
there were fist fights.

49:00.062 --> 49:02.235
Ship's company!

49:02.356 --> 49:04.279
I'm taking command of this ship.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.528
Mr Friar, I'll have the keys
to the arms chest.

49:06.652 --> 49:08.495
You'll give him nothing!

49:08.612 --> 49:12.742
BRANDO:
Hey! I'm not your fucking stamp licker.

49:12.867 --> 49:14.665
You're making a huge error.

49:14.785 --> 49:16.002
Don't make it again.

49:16.120 --> 49:18.964
I don't care if it costs me my job.

49:19.206 --> 49:22.335
Marlon, talk about rage.

49:22.460 --> 49:25.054
Talk about your own rage.

49:25.171 --> 49:29.472
All my life I've questioned
why I should do something.

49:29.592 --> 49:31.344
I had contempt for authority.

49:31.469 --> 49:33.096
I would resist it, I would trick it,

49:33.220 --> 49:35.723
I would outmaneuver it, I would do anything

49:35.848 --> 49:38.772
rather than be treated like a cipher.

49:39.477 --> 49:41.354
REPORTER:
Marlon Brando has been the subject

49:41.479 --> 49:43.982
of a good deal
of controversial publicity.

49:44.106 --> 49:45.824
He's been called a supreme egotist,

49:45.983 --> 49:47.610
uncooperative, temperamental.

49:47.735 --> 49:50.784
I've rarely seen
such a range of vicious critiques.

49:51.572 --> 49:55.622
BRANDO: They were blaming me
for all the delays and everything.

49:55.743 --> 49:57.461
They had to blame it on somebody,

49:57.578 --> 49:59.205
so they blamed it on me.

49:59.330 --> 50:02.504
Well, everybody has to have
a whipping boy and certainly the studio.

50:02.625 --> 50:04.798
They have to find a scapegoat,

50:04.919 --> 50:06.466
they have to find somebody.

50:06.587 --> 50:09.010
I was the most logical person.

50:09.798 --> 50:13.644
The sickening and endless variety
of lies.

50:13.761 --> 50:15.855
They can hit you every day

50:16.013 --> 50:18.641
and you have no way of fighting back.

50:19.934 --> 50:23.689
I was very convincing
in my pose of indifference.

50:25.105 --> 50:27.073
But I was very sensitive

50:27.191 --> 50:29.193
and it hurt a lot.

50:49.171 --> 50:50.514
There are times when you think,

50:50.631 --> 50:53.134
"What the fuck is all this for?"

50:53.259 --> 50:55.432
"Christ, nobody's listening."

50:56.804 --> 50:58.477
There's an old adage in Hollywood,

50:58.597 --> 51:01.271
they say "if you have a message,
go to Western Union."

51:02.560 --> 51:04.358
I didn't make any great movies.

51:04.478 --> 51:06.401
There's no such thing as a great movie.

51:06.522 --> 51:08.445
In the kingdom of the blind,

51:08.566 --> 51:10.534
the man with one eye is the king.

51:11.944 --> 51:13.287
There are no artists.

51:13.445 --> 51:15.413
We are businessmen, we're merchants.

51:15.573 --> 51:17.667
And there is no art.

51:19.952 --> 51:22.671
Agents, lawyers, publicity people...

51:23.205 --> 51:25.424
It's all bullshit.

51:25.749 --> 51:27.501
Money, money, money.

51:27.626 --> 51:29.845
If you think it's about something else,

51:29.962 --> 51:32.511
you're going to be bruised.

51:33.882 --> 51:36.431
I do want to ask you one thing
before we run out of time, Marlon.

51:36.552 --> 51:37.974
You've been quoted
in the papers as saying

51:38.137 --> 51:39.559
that you are going to abandon acting.

51:39.680 --> 51:41.182
Are you really going to do that?

51:41.307 --> 51:45.813
I feel that I'd like to pursue some
other interests that I have long had.

51:45.936 --> 51:47.529
And within two or three years,

51:47.646 --> 51:49.899
I will have come to the end
of my career.

51:51.358 --> 51:53.986
We're all gonna talk about civil rights,

51:54.194 --> 51:55.912
we're all gonna go on the television

51:56.030 --> 51:57.657
and say what we know,

51:57.781 --> 51:59.499
because the country is ignorant.

52:00.576 --> 52:02.624
(APPLAUSE)

52:04.622 --> 52:07.296
lam really moved and motivated

52:07.416 --> 52:10.966
by things that occur that are unjust.

52:12.630 --> 52:16.601
I've always hated
people trampling on other people.

52:19.762 --> 52:21.059
I was in a quandary,

52:21.263 --> 52:23.686
a philosophical quandary,
because I thought

52:23.807 --> 52:27.528
if I am not my brother's keeper,
who am I?

52:27.645 --> 52:32.867
Where does my life end and my sense
of responsibility for other lives begin?

52:34.443 --> 52:39.290
Black bodies swinging
in the summer breeze,

52:39.406 --> 52:42.535
and the smell of burning death.

52:42.660 --> 52:44.287
You could stand so much of it

52:44.411 --> 52:45.503
and to see these people

52:45.621 --> 52:48.545
being beaten and kicked and spit on.

52:49.625 --> 52:51.627
That could've been my son lying there.

52:51.752 --> 52:55.006
And I'm going to do as much as I can.

52:55.172 --> 52:58.096
I'm going to start right now

52:58.258 --> 53:02.308
to inform white people
of what they don't know.

53:02.429 --> 53:04.557
The white man can't cool it

53:04.682 --> 53:06.810
because he's never dug it.

53:06.934 --> 53:08.982
And I am here to try to dig it.

53:10.396 --> 53:12.615
King was in Memphis at the time.

53:12.731 --> 53:18.454
He was striking for a small wage
increase for garbage collectors,

53:18.612 --> 53:21.912
which was one of the best jobs
a black man could get.

53:23.033 --> 53:25.707
But I want you to know tonight

53:25.869 --> 53:30.090
that we as a people
will get to the Promised Land.

53:30.249 --> 53:31.751
BRANDO: That speech where he says,

53:31.875 --> 53:33.593
"I've been up to the mountain

53:33.711 --> 53:35.634
and I've seen the Promised Land."

53:35.754 --> 53:39.679
So I'm happy tonight,
I'm not worried about anything.

53:39.800 --> 53:41.894
I'm not fearing any man.

53:42.010 --> 53:45.310
BRANDO: "I don't know
if I'm gonna get there with you,

53:45.431 --> 53:47.433
but I am not afraid tonight."

53:49.810 --> 53:52.063
God, I still remember that.

53:52.229 --> 53:54.357
Ah, Jesus. That's terrible.

53:54.481 --> 53:56.575
He knew he was going to get killed.

54:01.905 --> 54:05.580
REPORTER: Have you considered that
you may suffer bodily harm yourself?

54:11.457 --> 54:12.925
Yes.

54:13.876 --> 54:16.129
BRANDO: I'm standing up,
not for the black race,

54:16.295 --> 54:18.297
I'm standing up for the human race.

54:18.422 --> 54:21.471
All men are created equal.

54:21.592 --> 54:22.718
This is life and death,

54:22.843 --> 54:24.015
this is real life.

54:24.136 --> 54:26.855
We're talking about human relations,

54:26.972 --> 54:28.690
we're talking about human rights,

54:28.807 --> 54:31.777
racial issues and that's why I care.

55:11.225 --> 55:13.319
<i>It was after Mutiny on the Bounty.</i>

55:13.435 --> 55:16.439
I was up in the mountains on Tahiti.

55:16.563 --> 55:19.316
And this guy said, "Do you see
that little island out there?"

55:19.441 --> 55:21.193
And I said, "No, I can't see it."

55:22.110 --> 55:23.453
He says, "Can't you see it?"

55:23.570 --> 55:25.698
"it's called Tetiaroa."

55:29.910 --> 55:31.662
I never was in a place that told me

55:31.787 --> 55:34.336
to quit running the way this place does,

55:34.456 --> 55:36.458
the way these people do.

55:43.382 --> 55:48.183
If I've come closer to a sense
of peace, it would be there.

55:54.852 --> 55:57.401
I didn't think of myself
as an owner of the island,

55:57.521 --> 56:01.025
I just thought that I'd paid
for the privilege of visiting there.

56:02.025 --> 56:04.153
I had nothing to give to them.

56:04.361 --> 56:06.580
They had everything to give to me.

56:09.908 --> 56:11.376
They don't care who you are,

56:11.493 --> 56:13.086
they don't care what you do.

56:13.203 --> 56:15.422
They don't know
that you're a movie star.

56:15.539 --> 56:16.882
They couldn't care less.

56:16.999 --> 56:22.221
You cannot lay dollars down
on the table and buy their soul.

56:22.921 --> 56:25.970
Very warm, loving people.

56:26.091 --> 56:28.093
They come up and put their arm
around you,

56:28.218 --> 56:30.437
come and kiss you for no reason at all.

56:30.554 --> 56:32.397
They just take love for granted.

56:42.316 --> 56:44.159
Don't look at me.

56:49.197 --> 56:50.824
If you took some kid

56:50.949 --> 56:52.451
and you brought him up in Tahiti,

56:52.576 --> 56:54.670
he'd be a completely different kid.

56:54.786 --> 56:59.758
He wouldn't have this cruel, mean
society killing him every day,

56:59.875 --> 57:01.593
killing the life out of him.

57:01.752 --> 57:03.004
All these kids of mine

57:03.128 --> 57:05.222
are filled with love from Tahiti.

57:50.342 --> 57:52.470
I love to hear you sing that.

57:56.682 --> 58:00.482
Tahitians have the beauty
of sleeping children.

58:00.602 --> 58:02.195
And when they waken,

they will waken into the nightmare

BRANDO:
I'm interested in making enough money

58:49.568 --> 58:52.742
so I can say "fuck you" to money,
but that's all.

58:55.157 --> 58:59.412
Acting afforded me
the opportunity of time.

58:59.619 --> 59:01.667
I didn't have to do anything.

59:01.788 --> 59:03.040
I only had to do it once a year

59:03.165 --> 59:05.293
for three months at the most.

59:07.210 --> 59:10.305
It became just a way of making a living.

LAWRENCE JAMESON:
You're certainly unprincipled.

59:17.095 --> 59:18.938
Lying and cheating
come naturally to you.

59:19.056 --> 59:21.605
You're completely without moral qualms.

59:21.725 --> 59:25.025
Yeah, you see, everybody's got
a good side if you look for it.

59:26.396 --> 59:29.821
BRANDO: Lying for a living,
that's what acting is.

59:29.941 --> 59:34.242
All I've done is just learned
how to be aware of the process.

59:35.155 --> 59:37.578
All of you are actors.

59:37.699 --> 59:41.454
And good actors,
because you're all liars.

59:41.620 --> 59:44.169
When you're saying something

or refraining from saying something

59:46.958 --> 59:48.426
that you really do mean,

59:48.627 --> 59:49.719
that's acting.

59:53.256 --> 59:55.429
Let me give you an example.

59:57.260 --> 01:00:00.764
You're coming home, four o'clock
in the morning, reeking of whiskey,

01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:04.689
and there she is, waiting at
the top of the stairs, your wife.

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:08.238
You wouldn't believe me, sweetheart.

01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:11.070
You wouldn't believe
what happened to me.

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:13.990
Your mind is going 10,000 mph.

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:15.909
You're lying at the speed of light.

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:17.872
You're lying to save your life.

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:21.619
The last thing in the world
you want her to know is the truth.

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:26.923
You lie for peace,

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.383
you lie for tranquility,

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.968
you lie for love.

01:00:32.546 --> 01:00:34.719
So, we all act.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.968
Some people get paid for that.

01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:41.222
In my experience, with the camera,

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:44.350
if you're a liar
or you're telling a lie,

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:48.024
you better be able to do it
with consummate skill.

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.488
If you're not thinking properly,

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:50.818
if you're not in your part,

01:00:50.939 --> 01:00:53.988

you can do about it.

I ever made in my life was called Candy.

Oh Jesus, Mother Mary.

Haven't you got any fucking pride left?

01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:42.999
I've lost the audience.

"Are you still making movies?"

Sensitivity is too high.

01:02:32.123 --> 01:02:34.592
The sensitivity is too high.

01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:48.058
The neurotic individual's entire
self-esteem shrinks to nothing

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:51.151
if he does not receive admiration.

01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:55.776
To be admired and to be respected

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:58.025
is a protection against helplessness

01:02:58.149 --> 01:03:00.402
and against insignificance.

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:06.249
And because
he's continually sensing humiliation,

01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:10.121
it will be difficult for him
to have anyone as a friend.

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:16.627
I used to think I'd never grow up.

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:20.130
I thought that life would go on forever.

01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:23.475
And then I worried,

01:03:23.591 --> 01:03:25.264
somewhere in the middle years,

01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:28.559
life is going away and I haven't done
this and I haven't done that.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.182

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:32.981
I've denied myself that experience.

There was a famous dancer, Ulanova.

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:41.451

I could play that part either.

I don't wanna get caught being afraid

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:04.993
that my story, my pretending,

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:06.828
my lie

01:05:06.986 --> 01:05:09.284
is going to be disbelieved.

01:05:09.406 --> 01:05:13.206
That's gonna steal
your performance away.

01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:17.501
You have to look at the cameraman,

01:05:17.622 --> 01:05:19.340
the producer lurking in the comer

01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:24.384
and say,
"I don't give a fuck about any of you."

01:05:24.504 --> 01:05:27.553
And if by chance an honest man
like yourself should make enemies,

01:05:27.674 --> 01:05:29.802
then they would become my enemies.

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:34.227
And then they will fear you.

01:17:49.748 --> 01:17:53.048
I've seen so many of my friends killed.

01:17:53.169 --> 01:17:55.046
Shot. Stabbed.

01:17:56.297 --> 01:17:57.765
Where do you draw the line?

01:17:57.882 --> 01:17:59.179
At what point do you say,

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:01.644
"God damn it, this is my turf."

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.012
"I was here first."

01:18:03.137 --> 01:18:06.232
"One more step on this land
and you're gonna get it."

01:18:07.933 --> 01:18:12.439
I was with Indian armed resistance
in Kenosha, Wisconsin...

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:16.984

belonged to them.

Four feet away from death.

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:36.254
There was an effort
on the part of the government

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:39.382
to cover up the military involvement.

01:18:39.506 --> 01:18:43.261
And any cover-ups
are going to be looked into.

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:48.107
After Watergate and all that corruption
going on, we just can't afford it.

- BRANDO: Of course.

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:55.652

are considered a dangerous person
to the FBI?

01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:17.674
They lie when they're alone,

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:20.264
they lie when they're asleep.

01:19:20.965 --> 01:19:24.970
They never see faces
without lies anymore,

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:26.937

of their son who died in Vietnam,

01:20:27.865 --> 01:20:29.993
fighting for his country.

They had parents so hogwashed

that rather than alter
their belief system,

01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:39.335
would kill their children.

Conviction of the myth is everything.

It was awful.

01:20:59.605 --> 01:21:04.281

He is without mercy,

01:21:23.796 --> 01:21:25.890
not because he's a merciless man,

01:21:26.006 --> 01:21:28.759
but simply because
that's the logic of it.

Half shadow and half light.

01:21:52.783 --> 01:21:54.956
He should be mysterious,

01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:05.512

had to contend with shooting
in the Philippine jungle,

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:08.151
a raging civil war and Marlon Brando.

01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:11.199
Coppola was appalled
when Brando arrived grossly overweight

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.822
and had to be filmed in shadowy light.

01:23:12.988 --> 01:23:15.161
COPPOLA:
He was already heavy when I hired him.

01:23:15.282 --> 01:23:17.580
But he was so fat,
he was very, very shy about it.

01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:20.295
REPORTER: But that was the least
of the director's problems.

01:23:20.454 --> 01:23:22.377
Pulling his notorious delaying tactics,

01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:24.000

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:28.428
costing the production
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

kind of left me in a tough spot.

BRANDO: Francis Coppola, he's a prick,

01:23:35.135 --> 01:23:36.682

How could he do that to me?

I saved his fucking ass

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:43.902
and he shows his appreciation

01:23:44.061 --> 01:23:46.905
by dumping on me.

I'd come home from school

and I fucking put my eyes
right through him

01:28:17.459 --> 01:28:21.009
POLICE OFFICER: Copy. All available
units responding to a shooting.

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:22.881
REPORTER: The son of actor Marlon Brando

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:24.929
facing murder charges this morning.

01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:30.022
32-year-old Christian Brando accused
of shooting his half-sister's boyfriend.

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:32.641
REPORTER 2:
Ayoung man, Christian Brando.

01:28:32.766 --> 01:28:35.019
His half-sister, Cheyenne Brando.

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:36.986
And her boyfriend.

01:28:37.103 --> 01:28:39.231
It was a triangle that proved fatal

01:28:39.439 --> 01:28:41.612
and brought tragedy to the home

01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:44.907
of one of the world's most famous stars.

01:28:45.028 --> 01:28:46.655
LAWYER: "I shot him, man."

01:28:46.822 --> 01:28:48.665
"But not on purpose."

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:50.417
<i>"it was an accident."</i>

01:28:50.534 --> 01:28:52.252
REPORTER: The two men had quarreled

01:28:52.369 --> 01:28:54.463
over Drollet's treatment
of Cheyenne Brando.

01:28:54.579 --> 01:28:58.379
Mistreatment police say allegedly
included physical beating.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:01.800
LAWYER:
"Two guys with a loaded gun, wrestling."

01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:04.843
"it goes off and he's dead."

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:10.888
I saw Dag laying there

01:29:11.847 --> 01:29:14.691
and I breathed into his mouth

01:29:14.808 --> 01:29:16.731
and I called 911.

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:20.154
REPORTER: Asking leniency for his son,

01:29:20.272 --> 01:29:24.823
Brando said Christian's life had been
filled with struggle and unhappiness,

01:29:24.943 --> 01:29:27.867
traumatized by a bitter divorce.

01:29:27.988 --> 01:29:30.457
I think that
perhaps I failed as a father.

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:33.710
And certainly there were things
that I could've done differently,

01:29:33.827 --> 01:29:35.500
had I known better at the time.

01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:37.463
I am at fault in this.

01:29:37.581 --> 01:29:41.336
And if I could trade places with Dag,
I would.

01:29:41.459 --> 01:29:45.305
The total sentence imposed
is ten years in the state prison.

01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:50.185
REPORTER: Cheyenne Brando is suffering
from mental and physical problems

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:53.138
and cannot travel here
to testify about what she knows.

01:29:53.263 --> 01:29:55.561
Cheyenne is doing her best...

01:29:59.895 --> 01:30:02.648
Excuse me... sorry.

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:06.535
REPORTER: Another personal tragedy
for actor Marlon Brando.

01:30:06.651 --> 01:30:09.074
His 25-year-old daughter Cheyenne

01:30:09.195 --> 01:30:11.573
has committed suicide at her home
in Tahiti.

01:30:11.698 --> 01:30:14.793
Cheyenne Brando reportedly
had made several suicide attempts

01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:17.083
before hanging herself yesterday.

01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:20.207
REPORTER 2: For Marlon Brando,

01:30:20.332 --> 01:30:24.087
Tahiti will never quite be
the same again.

01:30:39.184 --> 01:30:43.234
When in disgrace
with fortune and men's eyes,

01:30:43.355 --> 01:30:46.074
I all alone beweep my outcast state,

01:30:46.191 --> 01:30:47.818
and trouble deaf heaven

01:30:47.943 --> 01:30:50.287
with my bootless cries,

01:30:50.445 --> 01:30:53.790
and look upon myself and curse my fate.

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:06.920
BRANDO: There are times
when you wake up in the morning

01:31:07.045 --> 01:31:10.675
and you turn over and feel,
"Shit! What a life."

01:31:13.593 --> 01:31:15.345
God, I can't figure it out.

01:31:15.512 --> 01:31:17.139
Why did it have to be this way?

01:31:19.599 --> 01:31:20.976
I've had a hard year.

01:31:22.727 --> 01:31:25.697
Maybe harder
than you could possibly imagine.

01:31:31.903 --> 01:31:35.953
<i>You try to be as strong as you can be,</i>

01:31:36.074 --> 01:31:39.954
but everybody reaches break point
sooner or later.

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:45.584
Pain - I knew I had to deal with it.

01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:53.180
I've spent thousands upon thousands
of dollars on psychoanalysts

01:31:53.299 --> 01:31:56.894
and those guys do absolutely nothing

01:31:57.012 --> 01:32:01.017
but stick pliers and screwdrivers
in your brain.

01:32:03.226 --> 01:32:05.900
Life will have given me the truth

01:32:06.021 --> 01:32:08.194
and taken in exchange

01:32:08.314 --> 01:32:10.237
what's left of my youth.

01:32:12.068 --> 01:32:14.366
It took me a while to realize,

01:32:14.529 --> 01:32:16.827
you gotta be your own analyst.

01:32:18.825 --> 01:32:20.793
Unless we look inwards,

01:32:20.910 --> 01:32:24.960
we will not ever be able
to clearly see outwards.

01:32:26.791 --> 01:32:29.294
Nobody is born evil.

01:32:29.419 --> 01:32:33.469
Most people are simply
getting over bad emotional habits

01:32:33.631 --> 01:32:36.931
established in the first ten years
of their life.

01:32:40.055 --> 01:32:44.401
Christian was burdened
with emotional disorders

01:32:44.601 --> 01:32:47.400
and psychological disarray.

01:32:47.562 --> 01:32:50.065
The kind of trouble that I had in life.

01:32:53.068 --> 01:32:55.617
I never tried to be like my father,

01:32:55.737 --> 01:32:58.490
but one inadvertently takes on

01:32:58.656 --> 01:33:01.580
the characteristics of one's parents.

01:33:03.328 --> 01:33:05.251
When my father died,

01:33:05.413 --> 01:33:08.007
I imagined that he was slump-shouldered,

01:33:08.124 --> 01:33:11.503
walking to the edge of eternity.

01:33:11.711 --> 01:33:13.839
He looked back and said,

01:33:13.963 --> 01:33:15.886
"I did the best I could, kid."

01:33:17.717 --> 01:33:19.469
Finally I forgave my father,

01:33:19.636 --> 01:33:24.267
because I realized
that I was a sinner because of him.

01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:25.642
But he was a sinner,

01:33:25.767 --> 01:33:28.316
because his mother left him
when he was four.

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:30.063
He didn't have a chance.

01:33:32.774 --> 01:33:35.744
And through introspection

01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:38.238
and the examination of my mind,

01:33:38.363 --> 01:33:40.491
I feel as though I'm coming closer

01:33:40.657 --> 01:33:42.534
to the common denominator

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:44.748
of what it means to be human.

01:33:49.499 --> 01:33:52.673
Everybody is capable of hatred,

01:33:52.794 --> 01:33:55.217
everybody is capable of love.

01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:58.384
If we stretched ourselves
one way or another,

01:33:58.550 --> 01:34:00.052
we could become murderers

01:34:00.176 --> 01:34:02.099
or we could become saints.

01:34:03.555 --> 01:34:05.557
I've done a lot of meditation.

01:34:05.723 --> 01:34:09.023
The result is that
I have felt much calmer

01:34:09.144 --> 01:34:12.819
and I've had moments
of real tranquility.

01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:18.370
Don't you realize that you're thought of
as the greatest actor ever?

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:20.705
Tim's the greatest actor ever.

01:34:20.822 --> 01:34:23.951
He pretends he loves me when he wants
something to eat. Get outta here.

01:34:25.368 --> 01:34:29.123
BRANDO: Many times
I remember being down in the dumps

01:34:29.247 --> 01:34:31.045
and then I saw a movie

01:34:31.166 --> 01:34:34.136
that took me away for a few hours

01:34:34.252 --> 01:34:36.755
and I was completely restored.

01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:40.809
And I realized, oddly enough,

01:34:40.925 --> 01:34:43.929
that actors make a contribution
to people's lives,

01:34:44.053 --> 01:34:47.102
giving us a gift that you can't buy.

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:50.485
Something that they can imbue

01:34:50.685 --> 01:34:52.938
with power and beauty and magnificence.

01:34:53.062 --> 01:34:55.064
Something beyond themselves

01:34:55.190 --> 01:34:56.988
and we do need that.

01:34:58.568 --> 01:35:02.072
Acting is just making stuff up,

01:35:02.197 --> 01:35:03.699
but that's okay.

01:35:03.823 --> 01:35:05.621
Life is a rehearsal,

01:35:05.742 --> 01:35:07.335
life is an improvisation.

01:35:08.786 --> 01:35:12.256
I'm gonna have a special microphone
placed in my coffin,

01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:14.876
so that when I wake up in there,

01:35:15.001 --> 01:35:16.344
six feet under the ground,

01:35:16.461 --> 01:35:19.135
I'm gonna say, "Do it differently."

01:35:23.593 --> 01:35:27.063
Anthony. Come here, come here.

01:35:29.432 --> 01:35:31.184
BRANDO: The death scene.

01:35:31.309 --> 01:35:32.982
That's a tough scene to play.

01:35:34.896 --> 01:35:38.776
You have to make them believe
that you're dying.

01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:42.120
I would hope it would be
with one person.

01:35:42.237 --> 01:35:44.114
It would be something simple,

01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:46.617
like playing tiddlywinks

01:35:46.783 --> 01:35:50.128
or... I don't know, jackstraws.

01:35:51.246 --> 01:35:52.338
(MOANS)

01:35:54.332 --> 01:35:56.676
- (ANTHONY CRIES)
- CORLEONE: Oh, no! (LAUGHS)

01:35:58.086 --> 01:35:59.588
(CORLEONE LAUGHS)

01:36:01.381 --> 01:36:04.055
BRANDO: Try to think
of the most intimate moment

01:36:04.175 --> 01:36:06.177
that you've ever had in your life.

01:36:07.637 --> 01:36:09.639
Run down in there. Run in there.

01:36:11.099 --> 01:36:12.476
ANTHONY: Where are you?

01:36:12.976 --> 01:36:14.523
(LAUGHS)

01:36:16.479 --> 01:36:18.948
(COUGHS)

01:36:39.877 --> 01:36:43.632
BRANDO: Marlon. Listen to my voice.

01:36:44.674 --> 01:36:46.802
Just let go.

01:36:47.719 --> 01:36:49.517
Just letting go.

01:36:50.888 --> 01:36:52.390
Drift.

01:36:52.515 --> 01:36:55.439
Drift like a cloud in the sky.

01:36:57.603 --> 01:37:00.652
Drifting into that special state,

01:37:00.815 --> 01:37:02.158
the state of peace

01:37:02.275 --> 01:37:04.949
of the boy that you remember,

01:37:05.069 --> 01:37:07.163
watching the elm leaves come down.

01:37:13.202 --> 01:37:15.671
Don't hang on to thoughts,

01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:17.753
don't hang on to anything.

01:37:19.751 --> 01:37:22.049
They're old tapes,

01:37:22.170 --> 01:37:23.888
no longer usable,

01:37:24.047 --> 01:37:25.344
no longer useful.

01:37:26.924 --> 01:37:28.642
Chuck 'em.

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:31.639
Put 'em aside. You don't need 'em.

01:37:33.431 --> 01:37:36.685
You're there, you have arrived.

01:37:39.562 --> 01:37:43.863
Your mind is becoming quieter
and quieter.

01:37:44.859 --> 01:37:48.033
Bliss is coming over you...

01:37:50.406 --> 01:37:51.783
Now.

01:37:53.201 --> 01:37:54.999
Until the next time.

01:37:59.165 --> 01:38:00.963
Sleep.
