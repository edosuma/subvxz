50:07.544 --> 50:08.849
[Growls]

50:08.893 --> 50:10.155
One less to worry about.

50:10.199 --> 50:12.984
He's up-front about that
from the get-go.

50:13.028 --> 50:15.291
He obviously is
in a position of authority.

50:15.334 --> 50:18.120
We know he's tangentially
part of the CRM,

50:18.163 --> 50:20.035
but he's not wearing
a CRM uniform.

50:20.078 --> 50:22.559
He seems to have a lot
going on in his head.

50:22.602 --> 50:27.129
When Silas asks Dennis
about what this place means

50:27.172 --> 50:28.608
and what it's for,

50:28.652 --> 50:31.742
he gives this very heartfelt,
emotional answer.

50:31.785 --> 50:34.353
If the modeling is right,
we can clear out the state

50:34.397 --> 50:36.268
while the measures
keep more from coming in,

50:36.312 --> 50:38.270
we can gain a foothold.

50:38.314 --> 50:40.316
That's what
we're doing here.

50:40.359 --> 50:42.579
Starting over.

50:42.622 --> 50:45.103
It obviously
means a lot to Dennis.

50:45.147 --> 50:46.844
So we get the sense
that this place

50:46.887 --> 50:49.151
is about starting over,
but more than that,

50:49.194 --> 50:51.588
it provides others
an opportunity to start over.

50:51.631 --> 50:53.938
So it sort of begs the question,
"For Dennis,

50:53.981 --> 50:55.853
why does he feel
the need to start over,

50:55.896 --> 50:57.159
and what was his life before?"

50:57.202 --> 50:58.725
Those are things
that we'll be exploring

50:58.769 --> 51:01.163
in the episodes to come.

51:01.206 --> 51:03.687
This is the first episode,

51:03.730 --> 51:06.429
but we really have gotten
an extended look at Elizabeth

51:06.472 --> 51:08.213
behind the scenes, as it were.

51:08.257 --> 51:11.042
We've seen scenes of her
in her apartment last season.

51:11.086 --> 51:13.479
We've seen her
surveying the battlefield.

51:13.523 --> 51:15.742
But in terms of
how she operates this place,

51:15.786 --> 51:17.962
that's really the thing
that we're exploring.

51:18.005 --> 51:20.095
Dr. Bennett,
how are you doing?

51:20.138 --> 51:22.619
She always knew
this plan of Huck's.

51:22.662 --> 51:24.969
Eventually, Hope would
find out the truth,

51:25.012 --> 51:26.971
which means her father
would find out the truth,

51:27.014 --> 51:29.495
and there'd be a lot of anger
toward the CRM.

51:29.539 --> 51:30.931
That's how much my daughter's
safety meant to you.

51:30.975 --> 51:32.368
You sent one soldier.

51:32.411 --> 51:34.413
Elizabeth knew
that when it comes to Leo,

51:34.457 --> 51:36.502
his priority is always
going to be for the future

51:36.546 --> 51:39.418
and working for the future,
so, to that end...

51:39.462 --> 51:40.767
You're excused.

51:40.811 --> 51:42.465
...be angry, have your tantrum,

51:42.508 --> 51:44.815
but we know you're still gonna
remain loyal to the CRM.

51:44.858 --> 51:48.558
♪

51:48.601 --> 51:51.126
Elizabeth goes
to the perimeter

51:51.169 --> 51:53.389
to poke around,
to ask some questions.

51:53.432 --> 51:55.565
Lieutenant Colonel.
This is a surprise.

51:55.608 --> 51:57.610
Indira, sorry
to come unannounced,

51:57.654 --> 52:00.396
although I'm sure your lookouts
gave you ample warning.

52:00.439 --> 52:02.006
And we learn
that Elizabeth and Indira

52:02.049 --> 52:03.181
have a history together.

52:03.225 --> 52:05.096
These are two
strong female leaders...

52:05.140 --> 52:06.402
You can never be
too careful.

52:06.445 --> 52:08.317
...but at the same time,
make no mistake

52:08.360 --> 52:10.797
that Elizabeth is in charge,
and you don't want to cross her.

52:10.841 --> 52:14.018
And kind of flexes that muscle
and makes it very clear to her

52:14.061 --> 52:15.672
that, "I hope
you didn't betray us.

52:15.715 --> 52:17.804
I hope you're not harboring
any fugitives.

52:17.848 --> 52:20.242
'Cause if you're lying to me
in any way,

52:20.285 --> 52:21.634
there will be hell to pay."

52:21.678 --> 52:24.898
Oh, it's so much responsibility,
isn't it,

52:24.942 --> 52:29.251
having so many people
entrust their well-being

52:29.294 --> 52:30.643
and their survival
with you?
