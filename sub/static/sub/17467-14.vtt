10:49.518 --> 10:50.824
Are your friends
bugging you?

10:50.867 --> 10:53.043
No, my friends are guys.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.574
So, what should I tell Christy?

11:02.618 --> 11:04.925
Tell her we're good.

11:04.968 --> 11:06.100
You sure?

11:06.143 --> 11:07.754
Yeah.

11:07.797 --> 11:13.150
'Cause if you want to talk
about us or anything...

11:13.194 --> 11:14.499
[laughing]:
I really don't want to.

11:14.543 --> 11:16.066
I mean, it happened,
it's behind us,

11:16.110 --> 11:17.459
and it's really good
to be with you.

11:17.502 --> 11:19.461
Then I'm gonna send her
a happy face.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.899
So, what do you want to do?

11:22.943 --> 11:24.074
You hungry?

11:24.118 --> 11:26.468
No, I ate a little while ago.

11:26.511 --> 11:28.339
You want to go out
and see a movie?

11:29.950 --> 11:31.865
You know, we could stay here
and watch TV.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.954
There is a plan.

11:33.997 --> 11:35.477
Here. You drive.

11:37.522 --> 11:39.524
[TV playing indistinctly]

11:39.568 --> 11:41.483
[cell phone chiming]

11:41.526 --> 11:43.659
There they are.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.834
[chuckles]

11:44.878 --> 11:48.185
I am sending
a happy face, happy face,

11:48.229 --> 11:51.536
and just to screw with Marjorie,
a bleeding dagger.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.495
[chuckles]

11:55.366 --> 11:57.760
MAN: So, I ran into the hallway,
I banged on the door,

11:57.804 --> 12:01.546
and I tried the doorknob,
and it was unlocked.

12:01.590 --> 12:04.114
MAN 2:
And?

12:05.594 --> 12:07.552
You sure we're
not using the TV

12:07.596 --> 12:09.511
to avoid talking
about our stuff?

12:09.554 --> 12:10.904
I'm not.

12:10.947 --> 12:12.035
Good. I'm not, either.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.733
[chuckles]

12:13.776 --> 12:15.473
WOMAN: ...what I got to do
because I can make...

12:15.517 --> 12:16.561
WOMAN 2:
Isn't it beautiful?

12:16.605 --> 12:18.128
You seen this commercial?

12:18.172 --> 12:19.521
...will never know
there a six cups of spinach...

12:19.564 --> 12:24.178
That juicer really
can do anything.

12:24.221 --> 12:25.962
Look at that,
it makes soup.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.268
Mm-hmm.

12:27.311 --> 12:28.835
And pizza dough.

12:28.878 --> 12:31.620
Shut up.

12:31.663 --> 12:34.797
So, did you do it all night?
I bet you did it all night.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.190
[in Southern accent]:
Well, I'd have to bet you

12:36.233 --> 12:37.408
a bucket of corn we didn't.

12:37.452 --> 12:38.496
Who's that supposed to be?

12:38.540 --> 12:41.282
See?

12:41.325 --> 12:43.197
But you and Adam are
back together, right?

12:43.240 --> 12:45.416
I don't know, it was weird.
We watched TV for awhile

12:45.460 --> 12:47.418
and then when I asked him
if he was spending the night,

12:47.462 --> 12:49.116
he said he had to get
up early and left.

12:49.159 --> 12:51.379
Well, did you guys at least
get a chance to talk it out?

12:51.422 --> 12:53.337
No, he didn't want to.

12:53.381 --> 12:55.122
Well, you just have
to be patient.

12:55.165 --> 12:56.645
Oh, really? Where'd
you get that from,

12:56.688 --> 12:58.212
the inside of a Snapple cap?

12:58.255 --> 13:02.433
Sorry, and Snapple has more
trivia than actual advice.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.784
I got a quick fix.
You kissed another guy,

13:04.827 --> 13:06.786
now you got to let him
level the playing field.

13:06.829 --> 13:08.831
You're not making
the stupid suggestion

13:08.875 --> 13:10.615
that I let him go kiss
another woman.

13:10.659 --> 13:12.574
Well, not just any woman.

13:14.358 --> 13:15.795
Oh, forget it.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.626
Bonnie, you broke
Adam's trust,

13:21.670 --> 13:24.281
so he needs time and
you need to be patient.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.327
You're right.
You're always right.

13:26.370 --> 13:27.545
Thanks, Marjorie.

13:28.546 --> 13:29.634
Are you kidding me?!

13:29.678 --> 13:31.071
I just said that.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.986
Oh, I don't think so.

13:39.296 --> 13:41.821
This is nice.

13:43.126 --> 13:45.520
Yeah. It is.

13:45.563 --> 13:46.695
More potatoes?

13:46.738 --> 13:48.915
Still working on these.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.873
Take your time.
I don't want to rush you.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.657
Patience is my thang.

13:52.701 --> 13:55.617
Yeah, you mentioned that
a couple of times.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.622
Mmm.

14:03.712 --> 14:06.584
Mm, funny story.

14:06.628 --> 14:08.673
I didn't have a pan
that fit the chicken,

14:08.717 --> 14:10.414
so I had to borrow one
from a neighbor.

14:10.458 --> 14:14.027
You don't say.Yup.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.942
Just marched right up
and asked for it.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.378
And she just gave it to you.

14:17.421 --> 14:19.293
Yeah, I mean, got to give it

14:19.336 --> 14:20.860
back in the morning, but, uh...

14:22.339 --> 14:24.254
Yup.

14:30.434 --> 14:32.697
[door opens]Oh, hey.

14:32.741 --> 14:33.785
Christy's home.

14:33.829 --> 14:34.961
Christy!

14:36.745 --> 14:38.921
Hey. Don't worry,
I'll disappear.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.923
No, you won't.
Get on in here.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.273
Yeah, we got a roast
chicken and a funny story.

14:43.317 --> 14:44.927
BONNIE:
Come on.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.059
Let me fix you a plate.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.190
You really want me

14:47.234 --> 14:48.452
to have dinner with you?

14:48.496 --> 14:49.714
Of course we do.

14:49.758 --> 14:50.715
How was your day?

14:50.759 --> 14:53.022
Okay. I waited on a guy

14:53.066 --> 14:54.719
who looked like George Clooney
from the back.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.460
[both laugh]

14:56.504 --> 14:57.722
That is so funny.

14:57.766 --> 14:58.985
Is it?

14:59.028 --> 15:01.726
It's more the
way you said it.

15:01.770 --> 15:05.600
Okay. You know, I kind of smell
like Brussels sprouts,

15:05.643 --> 15:07.123
so I'm gonna go change my shirt.

15:07.167 --> 15:08.951
Aw.
Aw.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.693
I'll be back.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.479
[sighs]

15:17.612 --> 15:19.919
[humming quietly]

15:22.747 --> 15:24.097
Okay, this is weird, right?

15:24.140 --> 15:25.533
It's the pan.
She's Vietnamese.

15:25.576 --> 15:27.404
Who knows what she's made in it.

15:34.716 --> 15:37.980
No. I-I... I was talking
a-about us.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.851
It's... should we just go
and have sex?

15:39.895 --> 15:41.244
It's got to be better than this.

15:42.985 --> 15:45.422
Here, I'll push so you can
take off your pants.

15:45.466 --> 15:47.381
Whoa.

15:49.426 --> 15:51.646
CHRISTY:
Oh. I forgot the best part.

15:51.689 --> 15:54.214
The guy who looked like Clooney,
his name was Jorge,

15:54.257 --> 15:55.867
which is George in Spanish.

15:57.173 --> 15:59.654
Hello?

15:59.697 --> 16:02.918
Let the record show the advice
I got from this table was,

16:02.962 --> 16:06.443
and I say this with love,
absolutely worthless.

16:06.487 --> 16:10.099
That's my mother's hurtful way
of saying she and Adam

16:10.143 --> 16:12.188
were incapable of talking
about their feelings,

16:12.232 --> 16:14.016
so they had sex
until they fell asleep.

16:16.845 --> 16:19.021
Hey. I tried your
"being patient,"

16:19.065 --> 16:22.024
and it was the most excruciating
15 minutes of my life.

16:22.068 --> 16:25.506
I don't care how you got there,
I'm just glad you're happy.

16:25.549 --> 16:27.029
I hate when you take
the high road.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.770
I know.

16:30.467 --> 16:32.339
Things are back to normal.
He slept over and tonight

16:32.382 --> 16:34.080
we're going to the
Italian restaurant

16:34.123 --> 16:35.385
where we had our first date.

16:35.429 --> 16:37.648
Oh, that's so romantic.

16:37.692 --> 16:39.476
So I guess that means he
doesn't need to even things up

16:39.520 --> 16:41.043
and kiss someone.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.219
What's your deal, Jill?

16:43.263 --> 16:44.916
I don't know.
Sometimes I just feel

16:44.960 --> 16:47.441
like it's my turn to talk.

16:47.484 --> 16:49.486
[phone chimes]

16:52.185 --> 16:54.665
Hey, honey, I'm at the bistro,
but I'm not eating.

16:54.709 --> 16:57.233
[singsongy]:
I'm saving room for tonight.

16:58.713 --> 17:00.193
Oh.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.065
No. That's fine.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.241
We can always go another time.

17:05.285 --> 17:07.156
Absolutely.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.636
Have fun.

17:08.679 --> 17:10.594
I love you.

17:13.249 --> 17:15.164
He wants to go watch
a basketball game

17:15.208 --> 17:16.599
with his buddies.

17:16.644 --> 17:19.820
What about your romantic...It's fine.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.518
How can that be fine?

17:21.561 --> 17:22.867
He's blowing you off.

17:22.911 --> 17:25.087
You don't know that.Yeah, we do.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.436
It literally happened
in front of us.

17:27.481 --> 17:30.092
Okay. So what am I
supposed to do?

17:30.136 --> 17:33.008
I think you got to get him
to open up.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.531
Your daughter's
right, Bonnie.

17:35.706 --> 17:37.795
Thank you, Marjorie.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.928
At least somebody around here
appreciates...BONNIE: Shh, shh, shh.

17:39.971 --> 17:43.888
I'm just afraid...

17:43.932 --> 17:46.891
...if I get him
to start talking, he'll...

17:46.935 --> 17:48.850
talk himself out of
wanting to be with me.

17:48.893 --> 17:52.593
You and I didn't speak for years
and it just made things worse.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.290
It took a while,

17:54.334 --> 17:57.641
but I'm kind of happy

17:57.685 --> 17:59.339
where we are now.

17:59.382 --> 18:00.731
Really? 'Cause
just the other day

18:00.775 --> 18:03.038
you wanted to ditch
her in the desert.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.867
Seriously, what is your deal?

18:07.869 --> 18:10.567
Yes! Yes! And he drew the foul![loud cheering]

18:12.047 --> 18:15.529
Another round of shots
and I'm buying.

18:15.572 --> 18:16.834
Hey.

18:16.878 --> 18:18.880
Hey. What are you doing here?

18:18.923 --> 18:20.490
We need to talk.

18:20.534 --> 18:21.491
Here? Now?

18:21.535 --> 18:23.885
Yes, before I lose my nerve.

18:23.928 --> 18:25.626
All right.
What's going on?

18:28.368 --> 18:31.936
Adam, things are
not good with us.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.155
What are you talking about?

18:33.199 --> 18:34.548
Last night was great.

18:34.591 --> 18:37.725
Last night was super
weird until we had sex,

18:37.768 --> 18:39.988
and then tonight you
blew me off for this?

18:40.031 --> 18:42.599
It's ten cent wing night.

18:42.643 --> 18:44.688
Just admit it.

18:44.732 --> 18:46.342
You're still angry at me.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.955
Okay, maybe you're right.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.870
I don't want to be,
but every time I look at you,

18:52.914 --> 18:55.830
I think of you with that
other guy and it hurts.

18:55.873 --> 18:58.398
Watch the game, Red.

18:58.441 --> 18:59.877
I said I'm sorry.

18:59.921 --> 19:01.488
I don't know what else to do.

19:01.531 --> 19:02.793
Me, either.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.795
Maybe you should kiss Jill.

19:04.839 --> 19:05.883
What?

19:05.927 --> 19:08.364
Sorry. Just thinking out loud.

19:11.933 --> 19:13.587
What we had was really good.

19:15.197 --> 19:17.373
I'm still mad at you
for screwing it up.

19:17.417 --> 19:19.201
I get it.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.594
Thank you.

19:20.637 --> 19:21.638
"Thank you"?

19:21.682 --> 19:23.684
For being honest with me.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.382
So what now?

19:26.426 --> 19:28.210
I don't know, I...

19:28.254 --> 19:31.779
I guess call me
when you're less mad.

19:33.389 --> 19:34.956
But until then, I don't think

19:34.999 --> 19:36.871
we should see
each other anymore.

19:36.914 --> 19:38.829
[bar patrons cheering]

19:38.873 --> 19:42.181
Oh, that's just wrong!

19:44.357 --> 19:46.663
So I'll see you?

19:47.751 --> 19:48.970
I hope.

20:04.638 --> 20:06.553
What you got
today, Walter?

20:06.596 --> 20:08.381
Tofurky.
[whispers]: Keep moving.

20:15.039 --> 20:16.954
Hit me.

20:23.178 --> 20:24.527
Oh.

20:24.571 --> 20:25.920
Got to learn to trust you.
